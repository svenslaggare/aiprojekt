[12:04] <ryanpg> hi all... is there a better way to do dpkg-reconfigure -a? it's fairly stupid in it's behavior now, for example of the 100s of packages to be reconfigured one is likely to fail, at wich point dpkg-reconfigure just quietly stops
[12:04] <SpAc> thanks everyone... so then it wouldn't be hard to run 2 distro's of linux + win?
[12:04] <josh_> hey what is the vim command to do a global subsititue?
[12:05] <Yourname`> Hi, Is there a step by step howto that tells us how to network between ubuntu and winxp, with instructions for both sides?
[12:05] <ryanpg> also, there seems to be no way to resume where you left off, so hours are spent going over the same config options

[12:05] <SpAc> Hey, I'm switching to Linux! :) Just keeping win on there for those 1 or two windows things ;)
[12:06] <AlienX> SpAc, i would suggest using dapper if you're going to switch from windows to ubuntu
[12:06] <SpAc> AlienXL: how come?
[12:06] <coz_> TheGateKeeper, saw that video before , did you dual boot?
[12:07] <psusi> lk11mn: o/
[12:07] <timo90> any one know how to turn on IP forwarding
[12:07] <AlienX> SpAc, Dapper is much more stable and edgy still hasn't gotten all of the kinks worked out as far as hardware detection goes.
[12:07] <JohnM555> how can I make list of commands to be run when I double click the file?
[12:07] <SpAc> AlienX: ok, even though it is the latest stable release?
[12:07] <JohnM555> Like, terminal commands
[12:08] <sanmarcos> how does resolvconf update /etc/resolv.conf ?
[12:08] <oneseventeen> I just set up a server install, and I can ping computers on the network, but cannot ping or wget files from servers on the internet.
[12:08] <sanmarcos> JohnM555: bash script
[12:08] <SpAc> AlienXL: hahaha... stability... come on! I've been running windows! :P
[12:08] <AlienX> SpAc, absolutely. Dapper really isn't much different from Edgy and it's quite a bit more stable.
[12:08] <DShepherd> JohnM555: you need to learn bash scripting.. google :-)
[12:08] <JohnM555> sanmarcos: I'll look that up...
[12:08] <sanmarcos> oneseventeen: check your dns servers /etc/resolv.conf
[12:08] <manudeb> Hello I m trying to connect a Palm to the Internet threw IRDA (with a pppd script)... and some errors occured... my PDA connect to the pc but no internet :( some knows how it is possible ?
[12:08] <Yourname`> Thanks josh_!! :)
[12:08] <TheGateKeeper> coz_: no I have a caddy system, & put in which ever hdd I want to run
[12:09] <oneseventeen> sanmarcos: it has my network's IP addresses for our DNS servers
[12:09] <AlienX> SpAc, well, you can take my advice or leave it but I've been around for a while and would like to think I have a good idea what I'm talking about :)
[12:09] <Sputn1ck> hi there
[12:09] <youser> hey i cant get acces to my newly mounted windows partition even with nautilus
[12:09] <youser> any help?
[12:09] <oneseventeen> sanmarcos (which is probably why it actually gave me the IP address of google)
[12:09] <DShepherd> how do i turn on the ntfs writing capabilites?  mount rw?
[12:09] <oneseventeen> sanmarcos: doh!  Our firewall won't let anything on the internet until it installs antivirus software, I just need to tell the router to ignore this IP, nevermind!!
[12:09] <sanmarcos> oneseventeen: does ping www.yahoo.com work? are you using resolvconf ? apt-cache policy resolvconf
[12:09] <sanmarcos> oneseventeen: ok
[12:10] <oneseventeen> sanmarcos: thanks for the help though, I'll write down resolv.conf for future issues, I never know about that file!
[12:10] <sanmarcos> oneseventeen: its for dnss
[12:10] <SpAc> AlienX: I don't doubt it! I'm the one seeking your advice. I was just commenting on how unstable windows is for me
[12:10] <SpAc> so general consensus here is not to run Edgy yet?
[12:10] <JohnM555> sanmarcos: I have a script called wlan in my Home directory, is there I file type I can make it so all I need to do is double click it for it to run?
[12:11] <youser> i dunno why it says  i dont have permissions to acces the partition im surei gave myself permissions
[12:11] <sanmarcos> JohnM555: depends on how gnome handles it
[12:11] <AlienX> SpAc, yeah, I'm not a fan of windows myself and haven't run it in several years. If you're new to linux, you're going to want something that's a bit easier to use and more stable than Edgy in my opinion.
[12:11] <JohnM555> ok
[12:11] <Chippy> hey, is anyone else noticing bugs with the new NVIDIA drivers as compared to the beta ones?
[12:11] <okapi> Hello to all!
[12:11] <isaac_> hello
=== mumbles-zzz is now known as mumbles-zzz-off
[12:12] <xopher> Chippy, not yet no, well lol, havent even restarted X so ;p
[12:12] <isaac_> i try to add the universe repository
[12:12] <SpAc> AlienX: Ok. I've been looking around for some time, and I really like the look of Ubuntu. I've been using it on and off on another machine. But I've decided to take the plunge and move to Linux on my main desktop
[12:12] <isaac_> and i just uncoment some lines in sources.list
[12:12] <mentok> isaac_: so far so good
[12:13] <SpAc> AlienX: I'm not a total newbie to Linux. I've been running a debian server for a few years now. That's been really handy in getting to know your way around the console.
[12:13] <okapi> I have problem to access to my Ubuntu station from other PC using Samba. Anyone can help?
[12:13] <AlienX> SpAc, ubuntu is great. I highly suggest giving it a go. I've used several distros over the years and this is the one which I most prefer at the moment.
[12:13] <Chippy> xopher: it's updating the screen really weird in some cases, you can see if best if you highlight something, but it happens all over too (like when I type, the bottom of the cursor line stays there, only a few pixels, but...)
[12:13] <isaac_> is it enough do that?
[12:13] <mentok> isaac_: yeah
[12:13] <tacopon_> anyone tell me about antivirus on Linux.   Guidebooks about Linux mention firewall but never antivurus.
[12:13] <isaac_> really?
[12:13] <youser> i used to use iptables
[12:13] <mentok> isaac_: yup, or you can use synaptic and check the uncheked repos in the repo manager
[12:14] <youser> but it slowed my cable down to like 5k/s
[12:14] <isaac_> ok
[12:14] <SpAc> so... i'd like to hope I know a tiny bit more than the average newbie :)
[12:14] <Milk_> hello guys!! I'm having a REALLY hard time with WPA and edgy
[12:14] <xopher> Chippy, really weird, Ill tell you if I have any problems, and a possible solution, when I get the time to restart
[12:14] <Chippy> xopher: mkay
[12:14] <Milk_> I've got a belkin wireless usb dongle that edgy recognises, but I can't get it to connect
[12:14] <mentok> isaac_: just make sure you run either apt-get update on the command line or "Get Updates" in synaptic
[12:14] <JDahl> tacopon_, I don't think there has reported viruses for linux yet
[12:14] <kitche> tacopon_: there is no virus protection for linux most of the virus scanners out there only get windows
[12:14] <LionsPhil> Milk_: Seen the wiki?
[12:14] <AlienX> SpAc, as an example. Edgy doesn't like my external HDD which was never any issue in dapper but the new hardware detection tool isn't exactly ready for mainstream yet IMO
[12:14] <SpAc> What are your feelings on Fedora? My inital impressions (without having installed it) were that it was quite bloated!
[12:15] <youser> u can get avast forlinux
[12:15] <mentok> isacc_: otherwise the packages in the repo will not show up
[12:15] <youser> unnecessary thugh
[12:15] <youser> linux has no viruses
[12:15] <LionsPhil> Milk_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
[12:15] <Milk_> LionsPhil, yea, its not been much help, theres no wpa_supplicant.conf in my edgy install, unless there is an edgy specific wiki article
[12:15] <AlienX> SpAc, I'm probably not a good person to ask about fedora. I don't play nicely with it
[12:15] <youser> except haters (windowsusers)
[12:15] <AlienX> youser, there are indeed viruses for linux and have been for several years. Do a google search
[12:15] <LionsPhil> Milk_: Ah, no, you have to write it. In my case, I had one prepared from my Gentoo install.
[12:15] <kitche> tacopon_: you only really have to worry about rootkits but ubuntu is secure by default
[12:15] <youser> im  havin a hell of a time trying to transfer files off my windows hd
[12:16] <Milk_> hrm...
[12:16] <SpAc> AlienX: Not a fan huh!
[12:16] <LionsPhil> If you want happy-clicky GUI things, I'm afraid I don't know. ;)
[12:16] <Milk_> and it goes in /etc ?
[12:16] <ortega10> i upgraded to edgy and it worked like a charm, but my firefox fonts are horribly blurry, how do i change that?
[12:16] <tacopon_> oh realy?  why no virus on linux?
[12:16] <isaac_> mentok: but I can install bcm43xx-fwcutter after do that
[12:16] <Milk_> LionsPhil, I could care less about guis
[12:16] <LionsPhil> Yeah. See the Configuring WPA supplicant section.
[12:16] <Milk_> haha
[12:16] <AlienX> SpAc, not particularly. Many people absolutely love it but I've never much gotten along with fedora.
[12:17] <mentok> isaac_: is that a wireless driver?
[12:17] <SpAc> AlienX: Was thinking of running up a copy of that too
[12:17] <isaac_> mentok: yes
[12:17] <LionsPhil> wpa_passphrase will helpfull generate a lump of the configuration for you.
[12:17] <isaac_> mentok: see this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Edgy
[12:17] <kitche> tacopon_: there is rootkits which you can call virus if you really want but you don't have to worry about them as much on ubuntu
[12:17] <AlienX> SpAc, my advice is to try out  several distros and find out which one(s) you like the most
[12:17] <Milk_> LionsPhil, thanks for your help
[12:17] <LionsPhil> Interestingly, Ubuntu doesn't seem to provide /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf.example =/
[12:17] <LionsPhil> No problem.
[12:17] <SpAc> AlienX: I was going to put on the 64 version of Ubuntu. Wise idea?... yes... I have a 64bit machine
[12:18] <mentok> isaac_: it should be in the universe
[12:18] <mentok> isaac_: you'll also need ndiswrapper
[12:18] <AlienX> SpAc, I have no idea as I don't run a 64 bit machine
[12:18] <ortega10> i upgraded to edgy and it worked like a charm, but my firefox fonts are horribly blurry, how do i change that ?
[12:18] <AlienX> SpAc, you could ask on the ubuntu forum. It's pretty good and many people offer great advice
[12:18] <SHR3K> where doi go forhelp?
[12:18] <tacopon_> kitche, I see . thanks
[12:18] <philwhln> hi, I'm trying to compile eventlib on ubuntu, but I get the error "checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables". Does anyone know a way to fix this?
[12:19] <kitche> philwhln: did you install build-essential?
[12:19] <mentok> isaac_: which wireless card are you installing?
[12:20] <philwhln> kitche: no, i'll try installing that then
[12:20] <SHR3K> hi, ive justinstalled linux but i cant copy anything, it says privilages, someone sed i need to be root any now im lost any help?
[12:20] <isaac_> mentok: sorry but i don't want to use ndiswrapper, because you can install some aplications for wireless
[12:20] <macsim> I tried to change the assignation of my twosuperior key, I edit /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/fr and change the line key <TLDE>  { [              oe,              OE, leftdoublequotemark, rightdoublequotemark ]  }; like key <TLDE>  { [              twosuperior,              twosuperior, leftdoublequotemark, rightdoublequotemark ]  }; but it doesn't work any idea ?
[12:20] <kitche> philwhln: that error usually means your missing some packages that is required to build software
[12:20] <isaac_> mentok: bcm4318
[12:20] <mentok> isaac_: ok, and that is the instructions for the linux native drivers
[12:21] <SHR3K> can any1 1-2-1 message me i need somehelp settingup linux cheers any help appreiated
[12:21] <JohnM555> I hate wifi...
[12:21] <philwhln> kitche: you were spot on! thanks for the quick answer to my problem :)
[12:22] <JohnM555> I've been working at this for 2 days and I still can't get it to work
[12:22] <isaac_> mentok: yes, :D, i just installed
[12:22] <jatt> df
[12:22] <isaac_> :D
[12:22] <jatt> ls
[12:22] <JohnM555> The only thing I've been able to do is get the drivers installed with ndiswrapper, and I don't even know if I did that right
[12:22] <mentok> isaac_: sweet
[12:22] <macsim> JohnM555: what's wrong ? iwlist shows your wireless-card ?
[12:23] <LionsPhil> Wireless is a bloody nightmare under Linux, to be honest.
[12:23] <JohnM555> macsim: I'm not even sure anymore
[12:23] <archangeleon> Hey, I was wondering if someone could help me run the program cl-mcclim
[12:23] <Milk_> LionsPhil, I've noticed
[12:23] <Milk_> LionsPhil, any experiance with wifi-radar?
[12:23] <archangeleon> I installed it successfully, but I have no idea where it is or how to start running it.
[12:23] <SHR3K> can anyone help me i just need to know how to install one program and get permissions
[12:23] <LionsPhil> There are two big, glaring holes: i) the interface name is not standardised, and different drivers will give you ath0, or eth1, or wifi0, or wlan0, or...
[12:24] <macsim> JohnM555: what's ndiswrapper -l give ?
[12:24] <LionsPhil> And ii) all the GUI tools seem to expect WEP or nothing, and have pitiful support for roaming about.
[12:24] <LionsPhil> Milk_: Nope, sorry.
[12:24] <JohnM555> macsim: Um,
[12:24] <LionsPhil> I got wpa_supplicant working under Gentoo, and just transferred that across to Ubuntu when I fled that particular sinking ship.
[12:24] <Milk_> LionsPhil, yea, and oddly, the WIKI claims the gui can handle it
[12:24] <JohnM555> netwg121 driver installed, hardware present
[12:24] <LionsPhil> Yeah...I found that odd. I cleaned up that article yesterday, but couldn't verify that bit, so just left it alone.
[12:24] <macsim> JohnM555: iwconfig shows your card ?
[12:25] <JohnM555> macsim: And thats as far as I am. I've tried setting the data with iwconfig, but I'm either doing it wrong or to the wrong interface
[12:25] <JohnM555> macsim: I'll check again
[12:25] <Milk_> LionsPhil, wpasupplicant doesn't like my psk
[12:25] <LionsPhil> Hmm, interesting.
[12:25] <JohnM555> macsim: It shows eth2 with a bunch of data and ath0 with some data
[12:25] <JohnM555> macsim: I'm not sure where it says what my card is though
[12:26] <macsim> JohnM555: can you pastbin the out of iwconfig please ?
[12:26] <Milk_> LionsPhil, I tried the wpa_passkey thing, but got no response.. is it just slow?
[12:26] <SHR3K> can anybody gove me a hand, i stuck with a computer , linux and internet and i cant do anything
[12:26] <JohnM555> macsim: Whats that mean?
[12:26] <raghu206> how to install gnome-dock with out installing XGL
[12:26] <Milk_> LionsPhil, should just be wpa_passphrase "ESSID" right?
[12:26] <LionsPhil> Milk_: Shouldn't be...wpa_passphrase <my_ssid>
[12:26] <JohnM555> macsim: I don't know what pastbin means
[12:26] <LionsPhil> then type your passphrase string, and it should generate a config
[12:26] <macsim> JohnM555: you paste the iwconfig result on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:27] <JohnM555> macsim: ok
[12:27] <Milk_> got it!

[12:30] <macsim> JohnM555: ok

[12:31] <Milk_> LionsPhil, how do I know for sure which driver I'm using?
[12:31] <SHR3K> okay,i tried linux and obviously its not for me, is it as hard as this or am i doing something wroong, windows ept crashing, all i need is to know how to set permissions and install one program
[12:31] <LionsPhil> That bot's an impressive timesaver.
[12:31] <zyth> Hi, I have an Intel HDA Audio chipset (uses the intel hda audio module), and when I boot from the livecd and unmute the audio in alsamixer, audio is fine, but after I install to the hard disk, I get an error saying that the device is in use when I try and run alsamixer, and so sound doesn't work.  Anyone have any idea what I can do?
[12:31] <okapi> thor: yes
[12:31] <JohnM555> macsim: I'm going to shut it down and remove one of the cards(I have 2 wireless cards, one usb, one not, one has a driver installed, one doesn't) I'll be back soon
[12:31] <geokok> LjL: makes no difference. I get the same msg
[12:31] <macsim> JohnM555: ok ;)
[12:31] <LionsPhil> Milk_: Good question. Try wext and see if that works (or just leave off the -D flag or wpa-driver part). That should be generic.
[12:31] <Luakagon> Jordan_U, OK

[12:32] <LionsPhil> I have a curious chipset in my laptop which requires me to specify hostap. As for anything else...I don't know, sorry.

[12:32] <LionsPhil> I guess you could spot it in use with lsmod, but that requires you to magically know which of the tens of modules is youre wireless driver. Which isn't exactly fun. ;)

[12:38] <okapi> Thor: I did and can find folder under usr/sbin. But I never try it before.
[12:39] <Riyonuk> Is there such thing as a laptop with ubuntu installed? With no windows xp, just ubuntu, so I know everything works?
[12:39] <thor> okapi: ok...try the browser and see if you can get into it.
[12:39] <thor> SHR3K: can you be more specific?
[12:39] <LjL> geokok, i have already, and as i said, i don't know what the problem might be.
[12:39] <geokok> LjL: I knew it was too good to be true...something had to break...thanks anyway
[12:39] <brasileiro> can anybody help me setting up my LG DVD Combo? It just stopped working for no obvious reason
[12:40] <SHR3K> yeah ijust got ubuntu installed and i downloaded no-ip to desktop, i cant put ot into filearea it says permissions denied ore something so i need root apparently, i got toold to put su in command but no luck
[12:40] <SHR3K> and i cant install no-ip cus of permissions and also its on desktop
[12:40] <thor> SHR3K: ok...what is no-ip...is it a .deb package or a binary? Where are you trying to put it?
[12:41] <SHR3K> right no-ipis a tar-gz

[12:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gtk 2.6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:42] <mmassonnet> Is there a way to get X to not listen on tcp, even if it is not specified in xserverrc?
[12:42] <brasileiro> can anybody help me setting up my LG DVD Combo? It just stopped working for no obvious reason...
[12:42] <dusk> anyone have experience or know of a repository with gtk2.6?
[12:42] <thor> SHR3K: sounds like you are trying to compile a src file....rather a complicated task for a newbie. When you extracted it, it should have created a folder on the desktop, if you look in that folder, to you see something called Makefile, and something called configure?
[12:43] <SHR3K> yeah
[12:43] <baastrup_> hi, I have a laptop with duo core 2 processor, does anyone know how to manual turn on the cpu fan or speed it up?????
[12:43] <morphish> mmassonnet: you can add nolisten tcp to your gdmrc or kdmrc  (since with kdm it ignores what i added to any other rc anyway
[12:43] <SHR3K> no configure though
[12:43] <thor> SHR3K: OK...we will give this a try, but it will probably not work and debugging it is not something we can do over IRC...but let's give this a go....
[12:43] <thor> SHR3K: open a terminal and type 'cd ~/Desktop'
[12:43] <SHR3K> thanks i appreciate any help
[12:44] <morphish> SHR3K: if there is no configure, is there a autogen.sh? if not often it only needs a 'make' i do not know what yoyu try to build though
[12:44] <evilhamsternator> sound only works in root and firefox- please help!!!
[12:44] <morphish> SHR3K: look for the INSTALL file, it should list the required steps
[12:44] <SHR3K> yeah ofound that
[12:44] <overridex_> how can i make any apps running as "root" using my user's gtk theme?
[12:45] <JohnM555> Ahhhh Thank God
[12:45] <thor> morphish: if it does I would be surprised <smile>
[12:45] <mmassonnet> morphish: but I start my X session from a tty.  Actually, do you think there is a solution to have -nolisten tcp set "by default"?
[12:45] <SHR3K> but my original part was i cant access root
[12:45] <JohnM555> morphish: turns out I was using the wrong interface before. I had 2 wireless cards and I removed the one I didn't want to use.
[12:45] <SHR3K> atm im putting everything on desktop cus i cant put it in filearea
[12:45] <JohnM555> Shoulda done that sooner...
[12:45] <brasileiro> can anybody help me setting up my LG DVD Combo? It just stopped working for no obvious reason... cdrecord -scanbus returns nothing
[12:45] <thor> SHR3K>..it isn't time to access root yet...not until the install
[12:46] <Riyonuk> Is there such thing as a laptop with ubuntu installed? With no windows xp, just ubuntu, so I know everything works?
[12:46] <SHR3K> ok sorry
[12:46] <SHR3K> theres makefile
[12:46] <thor> SHR3K: did you type the command I gave you?
[12:46] <morphish> mmassonnet: you could add it to the script that starts X or to the right rc or pass it to startx perhaps, sec
[12:46] <SHR3K> tyeah it couldnt find desktop one sec
[12:46] <mmassonnet> :/
[12:46] <evilhamsternator> sound only works as root- could someone PLEASE help!!!

[01:02] <SHR3K> whats the web addy topaste so i can show you?
[01:02] <thor> SHR3K: then you don't have the compiler (gcc) or a bunch of other stuff installed. Like I said...really too complex for IRC
[01:02] <JohnM555> thor: its working now
[01:02] <menko> Does anyone else here use thunar under edgy?

[01:04] <SHR3K> as thor sed it came up with error 127
[01:04] <okapi> Thor: Do you know how to get rid of this error: "smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mount"
[01:04] <thor> kitche: I believe he doesn't have make or gcc....they don't install by default
[01:05] <jpedroza> Is there a chanel for the PPC version of ubuntu?
[01:05] <SHR3K> yeah i have a clean install nothing done yet
[01:05] <kitche> SHR3K: error 127 doesn't mean much does it show a lot of lines scrolling but you need to install build-esstenial
[01:05] <JohnM555> Hmm...When I do sudo iwconfig eth2 key [My key here]  I get an error 'SET failed on device eth2 : Unknown error 524'
[01:05] <SHR3K> yep
[01:05] <thor> okapi: yes and no. It is telling you that smbmnt can only be used by root. There is a way around that...by making it suid. Or....you can issue the command as 'sudo smbmnt...'
[01:06] <kitche> SHR3K: ok yeah pastebin what you have since error 127 doesn't mean much but you need that package
[01:06] <FunnyLookinHat> jpedroza, no, not specifically
[01:06] <Kannix_> Hi, when I shutdown ubuntu without closing firefox first, it always asks if I want to restore the last session when I start it. Doesn't Gnome gracefully shutdown running applications on shutdown?

[01:06] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[01:06] <kitche> Kannix_: that is a feature in firefox
[01:06] <morphish> JohnM555: does dmesg tell you more?
[01:06] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, it's firefox specific...
[01:07] <thor> okapi: it is done with the chmod command in a terminal
[01:07] <Kannix_> kitche: I thought it was a feature when you crash it.
[01:07] <JohnM555> morphish: Sorry, how do I do dmesg again? dmesg | more?
[01:07] <kyja> edgy is not excepting incoming connections properly. I have no software firewall and my router is forwarding what I want to my lan addy. so what is going on?
[01:07] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: But when I shut down firefox and reopen it normally, it does not do that.
[01:07] <thor> okapi: I think you can also do it in nautilus, but I don't use gnome so am not very familiar with nautilus
[01:07] <brasileiro> can anybody help me setting up my LG DVD Combo? It just stopped working for no obvious reason... cdrecord -scanbus returns nothing
[01:07] <menko> Hi, my printer has been priting REALLY slowly, and once I had removed it I couldn't add it again (it got stuck at "reading database"), so I removed all the printing related packages.
[01:07] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: and it only gives you that "restore session" option in case you crash it (or send a sigkill)
[01:07] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, right...   I think it's only when firefox is sent a close/end_process message by the X manager
[01:08] <menko> SO which packages should I install to use a printer with a guntenprint (gimpprint) driver?
[01:08] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: So it happens in KDE as well?
[01:08] <SHR3K> okpasted it
[01:08] <Super_King_> hey all. Does anyone know where I can disable the tiling thing GNOME does when you minimize windows? I know it's in gconf somewhere but I can't find it
[01:08] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, my guess is yes.  But I don't run Kubuntu so i can't say
[01:08] <b08y_> Super_King_ gconf-editor
[01:08] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: I changed from Firefox 1.5.x on KDE to 2.0 on Ubuntu/Gnome and thought "Wow, that is bad of Gnome" :)
[01:08] <mcni7e> hello
[01:09] <SHR3K> apparently i need to install something else first
[01:09] <okapi> thor: chmod command is like changing the setup through a terminal. There is no way to do that on gui. I am using KDE
[01:09] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, haha, yea go figure.  But that option wasn't available in 1.5 afaik
[01:09] <gato0_> hahaha, all of the time people like me join in channel looking for free tecnic suport :-D ubuntu is famous!! xDD
[01:09] <thor> okapi: open a terminal, and type 'ls -l /usr/bin/smbmnt'
[01:09] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: True. But as I said, I did not know it was on regular use as well. Just on crashes.
[01:09] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: It is a bit annoying, I must say.
[01:09] <Super_King_> b08y: yeah I've been looking in gconf-editor, I just can't find the key to edit :)
[01:10] <mcni7e> anyone got ubuntu running on a G5 machine?
[01:10] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, FF must interpret gnome telling it to close as a crash  ; )
[01:10] <b08y_> Super_King_ apps -> metacity -> general -> reduced_resources
[01:10] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: Is there no way to remotely shutdown firefox without triggering that "session" message?
[01:11] <Kannix_> FunnyLookinHat: Oh well.
[01:11] <SHR3K> kitche? i pasted it
[01:11] <FunnyLookinHat> Kannix_, probably not.  It seems like it would be easily avoidable if it was built in
[01:11] <okapi> thor: I have root
[01:11] <kitche> SHR3K: where's the url?
[01:11] <SHR3K> one sec
[01:11] <thor> okapi: I don't understand...what do you mean?

[01:13] <gato0_> eso es un salvapantallas tronco!
[01:13] <okapi> thor: is that mean by changing the privilege on that file it will fix my error?
[01:13] <SHR3K> how:P
[01:13] <oscar> si
[01:13] <menko> Which packages should I install to use a printer with a guntenprint (gimpprint) driver? (I removed all printing packages)
[01:13] <oscar> es algo asi
[01:13] <luisito> oscar: ve a #ubuntu-es
[01:14] <thor> okapi: slow down...let me explain....
[01:14] <SHR3K> download itoff net?
[01:14] <gato0_> ok ok! sorry people! xDD
[01:14] <sizzam> my sound stopped working.  whats the best way to restart audio in linux without rebooting?
[01:14] <okapi> thor:ok
[01:14] <thor> okapi: the first 'root' is the user that /usr/bin/smbmnt belongs to, the second 'root' is the group it belongs to...but we are interested in something else...
[01:14] <oscar> claro
[01:14] <jatt> sizzam:
[01:14] <jatt> sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
[01:14] <mcni7e> on my G5 machine i have problems installing boot loader after instalation ...
[01:14] <sizzam> thanks ja
[01:15] <sizzam> *jatt
[01:15] <kitche> SHR3K: it's a package which will isntall gcc make and other things that are needed to compile stuff
[01:15] <grout> whats the latest intel video driver?
[01:15] <thor> okapi: at the very left end it should say '-rwxr-xr-x'...do you see that?
[01:15] <morphish> mcmahonm: yaboot doesn't like you?
[01:15] <SHR3K> ok but i find it on net yes?
[01:15] <luisito> anyone here have ubuntu running in a G3 600MHz iBook?
[01:15] <okapi> thor:yep
[01:16] <mcni7e> morphish,  was it for me or for mcmahonm
[01:16] <mcni7e> ? :)
[01:16] <okapi> thor: I have -rwxr-xr-x
[01:16] <thor> okapi: ok...the first three letters (rwx) are the owner of the file, the next three are the group of the file, the third three are the world....
[01:16] <kitche> SHR3K: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:16] <morphish> mcni7e: oh, you
[01:16] <thor> okapi: so what that says is that the owner of the file (root) can 'r'ead the file, 'w'rite the file, and e'x'ecute the file....
[01:16] <mcni7e> morphish,  yeah, yaboot can't install ... complains about "path" for my drive in openfirmware
[01:17] <thor> okapi: the group that file belongs to (root) can only 'r'ead and e'x'ecute the file.....
[01:17] <sgorilla80> is there a way to tell your laptop to stop charging the battery?
[01:17] <thor> okapi: and the whole world can also 'r'ead and e'x'ecute the file...so you see that?
[01:17] <sgorilla80> it seems like my laptop is malfunctioning, and keeps swtiching on and off
[01:17] <JohnM555> when I set the key for eth2 with sudo iwlist eth2 key [my key]  I get 'Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : Set Failed on device eth2 : Unknown error 524' What did I do wrong?
[01:18] <sgorilla80> well the charger switches on and off, when it get close to 100%
[01:18] <dope_> yo
[01:18] <dope_> what's the command to restart the computer
[01:18] <sgorilla80> what do i need to look at to manually modify the battery charging settings?
[01:18] <sgorilla80> dope_: reboot
[01:18] <morphish> mcni7e: you could ask in #gentoo-ppc if there is no #ubuntu-pps JoseJX or others for sure know openfirmware paths in their sleep, i never had to fudge with mine OF stuff on a mac mini
[01:18] <dope_> thx
[01:18] <morphish> s/pps/ppc/
[01:18] <SHR3K> gotto put cd in one sec
[01:19] <okapi> thor: yes  but on my case do i need to put the user on same group as the root or should I change the user of the file?
[01:19] <FidO-DidO> ubuntu edgy takes some minutes to start, all is "fine" until de gdm logi, but after login it takes 2 or 3 minutes to load nautilus, the desktop and stuff
[01:19] <dope_> how do i kill a program that's running from the command line?
[01:19] <FidO-DidO> what's wrong for me?
[01:19] <mcni7e> morphish,  i had it installed on my G4 with no sweat... but G5 is diff. story obviously ... :(
[01:19] <okapi> thor: I want another user to mount the file.
[01:19] <Super_King_> dope: CTRL-C
[01:19] <thor> okapi: you don't need to do either. To get the smbmnt command to work you can either change the permissions or you can just do the command with a 'sudo'....
[01:20] <dope_> from the command line?
[01:20] <morphish> mcni7e: the guys really know, even if you might not mention you need it for ubuntu, but who knows they might actually still help, they love ppc
[01:20] <FidO-DidO> dope_ ps -A --> search pid of your program --> kill -9 pid
[01:20] <lllloo> hi peeps
[01:20] <shmio> sup?
[01:20] <mcni7e> morphish,  will try, thanks for the tip :)
[01:20] <thor> okapi: you can get around the error by starting the command with 'sudo smbmnt <whatever>'
[01:20] <lllloo> are there any # irc channels dedicated to tweaking Edgy eft
[01:20] <lllloo> ?
[01:20] <isaac_> hello
[01:20] <morphish> mcni7e: what tip? i said nothing!?
[01:20] <lllloo> nice to meet yas
[01:20] <lllloo> lol
[01:20] <thor> okapi: or you can tell the command to pretend whoever uses it really is root....which is the suid the error mentioned.
[01:21] <SHR3K> aha me m8y's downloading now and installing
[01:21] <JohnM555> When I try to install the network-manager(Which I downloaded and transfered because this doesn't my ubuntu doesn't have internet yet) it says Depenency is not satisfiable libnl1-pre6. How can I fix that?
[01:21] <isaac_> somebody knows a program wich I can crackin a WEP key with ubuntu???
[01:21] <JohnM555> wow I don't make sense...
[01:21] <morphish> JohnM555: install it
[01:21] <JohnM555> because my ubuntu doesnt have internet is what I was trying to say
[01:21] <thor> isaac_: aircrackng
[01:21] <kitche> lllloo: not that I know of but there is many websites really but what do you mean by tweaking?
[01:21] <SHR3K> its done
[01:21] <JohnM555> morphish: Thats what I'm trying to do
[01:22] <mcni7e> morphish,  well you gave me direction where to possibly look :D that's tip ... isn't? :d
[01:22] <morphish> JohnM555: transfer all deps to that machine the same way you transfered the network manager deb
[01:22] <{Malice}> Anyone know of a URL that would help me decide what PDA to get to only work in Ubuntu Edgy?
[01:22] <kitche> SHR3K: do you mean done running ./configure?
[01:22] <SHR3K> kitche build-essentials sone
[01:22] <JohnM555> morphish: I don't have any other debs :\
[01:22] <sgorilla80> isaac_: aireplay, airocrack, airodump
[01:22] <SHR3K> no installed build essentials
[01:22] <morphish> mcni7e: i never said anything, i never sent you to that channel! (/me hides ;P)
[01:22] <JohnM555> morphish: When I googled for it I got no results
[01:22] <SHR3K> want me to make file again and see results?
[01:22] <kitche> SHR3K: ok now run ./configure again
[01:22] <morphish> JohnM555: donwload and put them there
[01:22] <SHR3K> kk
[01:22] <okapi> thor: what happen is I am trying to mount a file through sanba share browser which is in GUI by double clicking on the file. I guess on that case i need to change the permission?
[01:23] <thor> okapi: do you want another user on that computer to get to the files, or a user on another computer on the network?
[01:23] <JohnM555> morphish: I would if I knew where to download them. Like I said, Googling gave me no results
[01:23] <mcni7e> morphish,  ah ... ok :D like that ... well no thanks then :D
[01:23] <lllloo> jesus
[01:23] <lllloo> tweaking
[01:23] <lllloo> did people forget what that means
[01:23] <lllloo> LOL
[01:23] <thor> okapi: no...I think you are misunderstanding samba
[01:23] <morphish> JohnM555: holy cow, nice lengthy list of dependencies
[01:23] <lllloo> its to improve edgy eft
[01:23] <okapi> thor: explain to me please...
[01:23] <lllloo> boot speeds and such
[01:23] <morphish> mcni7e: "no" problem ;)
[01:24] <SHR3K> paste.ubuntu-gl.org/30702
[01:24] <morphish> lllloo: you could tweak your kernel, if you are into that kind of stuff
[01:24] <thor> okapi: do you want another user on that computer to access the files, or a user on another computer on the network?
[01:24] <morphish> lllloo: this channel is more for basic install help it seems
[01:24] <okapi> thor: actually I am using samba to share file from different computer on the network.
[01:25] <kitche> lllloo: I don't know how upstart works so I can't help with the init editing which is what can make boot speeds faster if you configure it right
[01:25] <{Malice}> Anyone know of a URL that would tell me known PDA's that work?
[01:25] <SHR3K> kitche thats the results is that good orbad?
[01:25] <thor> okapi: There is a folder on another computer somewhere that you want to access from your computer?
[01:25] <kitche> SHR3K: looks good is it done?
[01:25] <okapi> thor:I am trying to share file and resources beetwen computer.
[01:26] <okapi> thor: yes, actually there is 4 computers on the network.
[01:26] <SHR3K> yeah theres a file in there called no-ip created now what?
[01:26] <kitche> SHR3k: make && sudo make install
[01:26] <okapi> Thor: 2 pc run windows and 2 pc run linux (Ubuntu and suse)
[01:26] <isaac_> sgorilla80:  i just installed but i don't see any icon to access aircrack-ng
[01:26] <thor> okapi: let's assume you have a folder you want another computer to access. You define it as a share in swat...but you don't need smbmnt...the other guy does.
[01:27] <SHR3K> kitche you lost me
[01:27] <sgorilla80> isaac_: you will run those programs from command line
[01:27] <isaac_> sgorilla80:  thanks
[01:27] <sgorilla80> sgorilla80: also you need a patched driver, and your card must be supported
[01:27] <thor> okapi: the other linux computers will use smbmnt to get to your folder...the windows machines will just access it as part of their 'neighbourhood'
[01:27] <kitche> SHR3K: those commands are used to compile make install will install the software
[01:27] <SHR3K> so in command i type make && sudo make install?
[01:27] <SHR3K> ok
[01:27] <isaac_> sgorilla80:  wich repository i can find airodump and airplay
[01:28] <thor> okapi: now...if the other guy has a folder you want to get to...he has to have samba and swat and set up a share...and you get to his folder using smbmnt
[01:28] <squidink> anyone had any success using gvim with files on a sftp/scp connection via the gnome-vfs?
[01:28] <thor> okapi: you don't use smbmnt for shares on your own computer...just for shares on the other guy's computer
[01:29] <okapi> Thor: yep you are right but what happen is is I try to access to the folder or file through SMB/CIFS share browser that where the error occur.
[01:30] <SHR3K> kitch typed sudomake install and it ran theprgram entered details is that it?
[01:30] <thor> okapi: ok...here we go...in your terminal type 'sudo chmod 4766 /usr/bin/smbmnt'
[01:30] <zspada15> how does a chmod have 4 digits?
[01:30] <okapi> thor: what is that? explain it to me
[01:31] <pjz> zspada15: the leading one is special bits: setuid, setgid, that kind of thing
[01:31] <zspada15> ic
[01:31] <pjz> is there a FAQ about running vmware under edgy?
[01:31] <badwarrior> people
[01:31] <thor> okapi: the 4 makes the command suid...the rest refer to the rwx...each r is a 4, each w is a 2, and each x is a 1...so rwx=7, r-x=5 (oops...should be 4755...sorry)
[01:31] <badwarrior> somebody here
[01:31] <badwarrior> who can help me about xchat ubuntu version ?
[01:31] <zspada15> pjz: yes
[01:31] <chalcedony> *hugs* badwarrior
[01:31] <zspada15> pjz: google it
[01:31] <Crankymonky> badwarrior, hit start about in xchat

[01:32] <badwarrior> people, for xchat ubuntu version i must have linux ubuntu ?
[01:32] <LjL> ...?
[01:32] <Crankymonky> badwarrior, there is no special "ubuntu version" of xchat
[01:32] <thor> okapi: so after 'sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/smbmnt' if you type again 'ls -l /usr/bin/smbmnt' you will see a little change
[01:32] <okapi> thor: without respect how did you learn linux that deep?
[01:33] <Crankymonky> the version of xchat installed in ubuntu is xchat 2.6.6
[01:33] <thor> okapi: I had a good tutor <smile>.
[01:33] <pudland> want to install fglrx w/ radeon 9200.  how do i backup xorg?

[01:33] <sgorilla80> anyone use lm-sensors in edgy
[01:33] <thor> okapi: not in one night <smile>
[01:34] <SurfnKid> hi, how do i know if my WIFI card can have the mac changed
[01:34] <LjL> three hours?
[01:34] <badwarrior> yep

[01:34] <badwarrior> so somebody can send me the ubuntu linux ???????
[01:34] <badwarrior> so somebody can send me the ubuntu linux ???????
[01:34] <LjL> badwarrior, you're not making any sense to me honestly. three hours what?
[01:34] <Crankymonky> dude, downloading it through bittorent will be fasest
[01:34] <LjL> and don't spam please
=== overridex_ is now known as overridex
[01:34] <sgorilla80> SurfnKid: no one three
[01:34] <thor> okapi: now you should see -rwsr-xr-x the 's' means we have set suid (with the 4 in the chmod command)
[01:34] <badwarrior> man i must wait 3 hours :)))))))
[01:34] <sgorilla80> *there
[01:34] <Crankymonky> just wait 3 hours, you are downloading a whole OS
[01:34] <badwarrior> ok
[01:34] <thor> okapi: you can get a good explanation of chmod by typing 'man chmod' in a terminal
[01:34] <LjL> badwarrior, if your internet connection is slow, there's little i can do about it
[01:34] <badwarrior> i'll download :D
[01:35] <badwarrior> ftp://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/ubuntulinux.org/releases/kubuntu/6.06/kubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[01:35] <badwarrior> from here i can download it
[01:35] <badwarrior> :)
[01:35] <LjL> that's Kubuntu actually
[01:35] <thor> badwarrior: you can request a cd from the website, but it will take longer than 3 hours
[01:36] <badwarrior> that will be 3 days :)
[01:36] <wastrel> they're really slow with the cd's eh
[01:36] <LjL> blah
[01:36] <Toma-> more like 3 weeks
[01:36] <mzli> badwarrior: It'll take more than 3 weeks.

[01:37] <ejos> a
[01:37] <okapi> thor: I have change " rwsr-xr-x"
[01:37] <FidO-DidO> what's wrong for me?
[01:37] <thor> okapi: good...now you won't get that error any more (I hope)
[01:37] <SHR3K> and i need to place it in filedirectory in a folder i made but i cant it still says permissions
[01:37] <sgorilla80> is sysfs missing from ubuntu?
[01:37] <Falstius> wastrel: okay, so why doesn't the "networking" tool modify that file?
[01:37] <variant> i have a minor problem, amarok on gnome, the systray icon appears over hte main menu icon and cant be moved. it does not appear to be sitting in the gnome systray as it is supposed to. anyone got any ideas?
[01:38] <variant> sgorilla80: no, it is a central part
[01:38] <okapi> thor: thank you. let me try it
[01:38] <nikosapi> I'm trying to compile some stuff on this new edgy install and whenever I run make -f Makefile.cvs I get errors like this: /usr/share/aclocal/libglade.m4:7: warning: underquoted definition of AM_PATH_LIBGLADE     Any idea what might be causing this?

[01:39] <timo90> Hey i need some help here
[01:39] <variant> sgorilla80: try modprob i2c
[01:39] <thor> okapi: you shouldn't be using smbmnt directly, you should be using smbmount

[01:41] <Limulf>  Hello all. My webcam did not work with the drivers supplied with Edgy (spca5xx and pwc) so after some  try and error I have managed to make it work, installing another driver (gspcav1 from http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html ). My question: Is it a good idea to stop the other two drivers from loading? How would I do that? I have tried with modprobe -r (which just runs but does not remove the driver from memory) and 
[01:41] <sgorilla80> variant: see how it works in windows, then implement it in linux?

[02:06] <LjL> well, i used to simply ping the machine i wanted to wake up
[02:06] <JohnM555> For my wireless, what would I have to setup before I should expect iwlist eth2 scan to return any results
[02:06] <nofxx> dope, you need a program to insert the card you wanna wake MAC

[02:07] <nofxx> i think wol is a diferent protocol then ping
[02:07] <dope> hmm
[02:07] <LjL> nofxx, i don't know, i do know that some Windows computers i used to manage did wake on ping

[02:08] <dope> same thing
[02:08] <dope> that's what it said in the bios anyway
[02:09] <shwag> so 'backports' just contains newer version of stuff already in 'main' ?

[02:09] <ZirJoker> ok the most efficient cd burner program?
[02:09] <fido-dido> nofxx wake is with wol, shutdown is with admin access
[02:09] <nofxx> dope, search for "windows wol"
[02:09] <SlyGuy> i don't crap about gdesklets :)

[02:10] <SlyGuy> i don't know crap rather

[02:10] <ailean> SlyGuy, it's cool eh?
[02:10] <nofxx> fido-dido  , didn't

[02:12] <Chippy> hey, is anyone else noticing bugs with the new NVIDIA drivers as compared to the beta ones?  I'm getting a sort of "tearing", where parts of the screen don't update properly until something forces them to
[02:12] <SHR3K> ok
[02:12] <pjz> why is unison missing from edgy?
[02:13] <ailean> I see there's a new splash screen for the "beta drivers".  It doesn't actually *say* "Beta" on it.  Are they no longer beta?

[02:15] <SlyGuy> where does one find them?
[02:15] <Lonnie> I have an old laptop that will Not Boot *buntu media, so I have installed Debian stable and upgraded to testing.  Is there a decent link for *buntu sources lists, and is it even possible to uprade to say, Xubuntu from Debian testing?
[02:15] <ailean> SlyGuy, i think they're in the repos
[02:16] <pjz> iter: thanks
[02:16] <pjz> Super_King_: thanks

[02:16] <iter> I think you'll like ubuntu
[02:17] <ailean> can anyone answer Lonnie?
[02:17] <iter> Lonnie: it may be possible but it's ill-advised

[02:19] <Groovebot> !ati
[02:19] <ailean> chewy, there's a channel called #ubuntu-xgl. it might be better for you
[02:19] <Lonnie> iter:  Well, it really isn't a production machine.  The machine only has 64meg of ram and a P133, and have tried all manner of CDs, booted Mepis I'm thinking but crashed do to lack of ram.
[02:19] <pjz> I really like the fact that kubuntu at least tires to deal with me having both an ATI and an nvidia card each with its own monitor

[02:20] <Groovebot> s

[02:21] <apokryphos> !helpme
[02:21] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:21] <chewy> does this mean anything to anyone (it comes from fgl_glxgears)
[02:21] <pjz> Born_In_Xixax: get more RAM; RAM's cheap, the only limit should be what the motherboard supports
[02:21] <chewy> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[02:21] <nofxx> JohnM555 , god have mercy of you bro.. i'm more then a week trying to set my wifi to work
[02:21] <Born_In_Xixax> true never tried xubuntu, you may be able to be usable with 96MB...64 I think will still be tough
[02:21] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: Is it WEP or WPA?
[02:21] <JohnM555> it always says ' Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2)" Set failed on device eth2 : Unknown error 523
[02:21] <JohnM555> Jordan: WEP
[02:21] <Brokenstein> getting more ram isnt always an option
[02:21] <Born_In_Xixax> it's an old laptop though, may be difficult to get ram for it?
[02:22] <Lahey> i am about to download Ubuntu, what does it come with, any links that have the programs, I want it for desktop and server use
[02:22] <JohnM555> nofxx: Thanks, I need it I spent ALL yesterday trying to get wifi to work
[02:22] <Lonnie> Yep, ram is maxed out at 64 meg.

[02:23] <dope> how do i find my mac address
[02:23] <nofxx> JohnM555 , i managed to set wep working only with the network tools GUI...

[02:23] <dope> thx

[02:23] <ailean> Lahey, hi
=== Cas_ is now known as Cas
[02:23] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: Yes.
[02:24] <LjL> shwag: the basic structure is: dpkg does the hard work of installing and removing .deb packages (a .deb is an 'ar' archive containing two '.tar.gz' archives) - APT is the thing that knows about repositories and how to solve dependencies, and then calls dpkg to do the installs (repositories are http or ftp servers with a special directory structure, and each repository can have a number of components) - apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, adept etc. are
[02:24] <LjL> front-ends to APT - aptitude is a bit special in that it does a bit of dependency-managing work itself
[02:24] <ailean> Lahey, check out the homepage at www.ubuntu.com for a list. For questions, ask us
[02:24] <Lahey> hi, i am about to download Ubuntu, what does it come with, any links that have the programs, I want it for desktop and server use
[02:24] <nofxx> JohnM555 , i think it is.... then I tryed wpa, and now I can't connect even on open system....
[02:24] <JohnM555> nofxx: I don't see how that helps set up the wireless, I thought that just lets you monitor it
[02:24] <JohnM555> the network tools one
[02:24] <Lahey> k thanks
[02:24] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Lahey about packages
[02:24] <ailean> Lahey, you can download an iso from that page
[02:24] <ailean> Lahey, and try it without installing it
[02:24] <JohnM555> the Networking Gui doesn't let me change much, and what I do change doesn't work

[02:24] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!

[02:25] <Lonnie> ailean; getting something I can boot the machine with has been my biggest problem, that is why I went back to Debian.
[02:25] <Brokenstein> Lonnie: google the inspiron 2650 it's a pretty nice budget laptop
[02:25] <ailean> Lonnie, is it an old machine?
[02:25] <LjL> Lahey: well, it's called Desktop CD, and it's actually the main CD that you use to install Ubuntu - but it also acts as a "live" CD, yes

[02:25] <Brokenstein> yup it was dell's first pntium 4
[02:25] <ailean> Lahey, is it an old machine?
[02:25] <Lahey> sweet

[02:25] <strabes> Jordan_U: whatever is the default with ubuntu
[02:25] <Lahey> ita an AMD Athlone xp
[02:26] <Lonnie> Brokenstein:  Wally world just had a 3400+ AMD system with 512 and a DVD for $400.
[02:26] <nofxx> JohnM555 , only essid and key ,  the dhcp thing will depend on your AP
=== sizzam_away is now known as sizzam
[02:26] <nofxx> JohnM555 , does it give you an IP automaticaly ? then go with dhcp....
[02:26] <ailean> iter, Lonnie: isn't that too old to even use?? :)
[02:26] <Lonnie> ailean; yes, 97 version.
[02:26] <Lahey> AMD Athlon Xp 1.8ghz
[02:26] <Lonnie> ailean
[02:26] <JohnM555> nofxx: I believe it does... :\
[02:26] <strabes> Jordan_U: which is better and which will fix the above problem?
[02:26] <Brokenstein> hmm about same price range
[02:26] <JohnM555> nofxx: But Its not working for me, I have changed the essid and password already
[02:27] <Lonnie> ailean:  heavens no, runs Debian just fine, a bit slow, but runs it fine.
[02:27] <nofxx> JohnM555 , well try dhcp... you are connect to your own AP or some ISP ?
[02:27] <Jordan_U> strabes: Alsa is better, and that is what Ubuntu uses by default.
[02:27] <JohnM555> My own.
[02:27] <ailean> Lonnie, Xubuntu is supposed to be for older machines. i would think they would have a way round this...
[02:27] <strabes> Jordan_U: ok then i'm using alsa; do you have any idea why it does this?
[02:27] <Brokenstein> DamnSmallLinux will work well if nothing else
[02:27] <nofxx> JohnM555 , you have wifi connection ? I mean... you are connected but dont have a IP or you are not connected at all ?
[02:28] <JohnM555> nofxx: And i have tried it, it still doesn't work. When I try iwlist eth2 scan I get no results too
[02:28] <ailean> Lahey, you got the page up? Ubuntu should run very well on your system
[02:28] <JohnM555> nofxx: Not connected at all
[02:28] <xp_prg> hi all, I am new to ubuntu, do I use apt to install things?
[02:28] <xp_prg> or like yum?
[02:28] <boggle> xp_prg: you can, or you use synaptic
[02:28] <Terminus> xp_prg: use aptitude. =)
[02:28] <Lonnie> ailean; that is the *buntu I was thinking of, looks like it is Possible to get Ubuntu installed and then upgrade to Xubuntu, but looks like it is a PITA.
[02:28] <nofxx> JohnM555 , try "iwconfig"   check if the options are ok
[02:28] <Lahey> ya i got it, it takes me 6.06.1
[02:29] <Terminus> xp_prg: aptitude = super cow powers
[02:29] <Jordan_U> strabes: Some programs still use OSS though, including flash 7
[02:29] <JohnM555> nofxx: I think messing with the gui made it worse, the options seem to have gone away
[02:29] <Lahey> it the i386 version for me?
[02:29] <xp_prg> what would be the command to load the package dealing with libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3: cannot open shared object file
[02:29] <xp_prg> also when I type y I get z
[02:29] <nofxx> JohnM555, your wifi is on eth2 ?  what kind of device it is ??
[02:29] <JohnM555> I actually think I'm cursed and ubuntu hates me...
[02:29] <xp_prg> I think the keyboard is in like a german mode
[02:29] <Suspekt> anyone in here a raid expert?
[02:29] <strabes> Jordan_U: so I can't get around it with flash 7? does flash 9 fix that?
[02:29] <xp_prg> how do I make it an english mode?
[02:29] <maria> hi guys, i just went to my network places, and i went to mshome, then my windows computer, then i right clicked on my dvdrom, and clicked connect to this server, so now when i go to my computer, i see DVD Rom there on the left hand side, and it has an icon which says SMB, now i wanted to wine something off that remote share, but how do i get to it in command line? or mount it to another folder so i can make it my cd rom in wine?
[02:29] <magickal1> Here is the question of the day, Can you revert an installation?  Edgy just aint cutting it and the random crashes are just too much to handle
[02:29] <iter> Suspekt: mdadm, what else do you need to know ?
[02:29] <nofxx> if it is connected with a ethernet blue cable, you need to configure thoguth the device web front.. .not the operational system
[02:29] <ailean> Lahey, precede everything you say to me with "ailean" or i might miss it.  most likely that is the version for you, yes
[02:29] <JohnM555> nofxx: Um its a netgear wg121 usb, I am using the ndiswrapper to get the driver to work

[02:29] <thombone> question please: has upgrading from dapper to edgy (using update-manager) become any easier or stable lately? Also, anyone know of any blocker packages I should probabl uninstall before I try it again?
[02:29] <Lonnie> ailean :  I may have to try getting Tom's boot floppy and see about getting the Xubuntu CD booted up that way, was hoping that I could just change the sources lists and do and upgrade.
[02:30] <LjL> xp_prg: you use the APT system to install packages on Ubuntu. there are a few frontends available: Synaptic (Gnome), Adept (KDE), apt-get (command line) and aptitude (command line, text interface) are probably the most used ones
[02:30] <nofxx> JohnM555, ahh I see
[02:30] <Brokenstein> anybody know what it could mean?
[02:30] <Jordan_U> strabes: Yes, flash 9 fixes that problem, and with other programs you can work around it using aoss...
[02:30] <ailean> Lahey, 6.06 is not the most recent version, but it does have long term support
[02:30] <xp_prg> LjL do you know the package dealing with the lib I nee?
[02:30] <xp_prg> d
[02:30] <Suspekt> iter, i am trying to build a mirror out of hda1 and hdb1, both formating with fat32

[02:30] <kawa> hi there ... what a mess ...
[02:30] <ailean> Lonnie, sorry i can't be of any help to you!
[02:30] <Suspekt> iter, i can figure out the syntax of mdadm,
[02:30] <Terminus> xp_prg: i'm not familiar with libstdc++ versions, but you could maybe try 'sudo aptitude install libstdc++6'
[02:30] <JohnM555> nofxx: After setting my options in iwconfig, is there anything else I need to do?
[02:30] <strabes> Jordan_U: sweet thanks for your help
[02:30] <Lonnie> NP ailean, you tried, and that's all I can ask.
[02:30] <iter> Suspekt: http://www.networknewz.com/2003/0113.html
[02:31] <LjL> Lahey: you should think whether you want 6.06 (Dapper) or 6.10 (Edgy). Edgy is the newest version, but Dapper is "LTS" (long time support)
[02:31] <nofxx> JohnM555 , sometimes a restart make thing work.. hehe.. try setting it all clicking the OKays and a good restart.. might do it
[02:31] <botxj> is ubuntu a guarantee that i will have a DRM free experience?
[02:31] <ailean> Lonnie, 99% of comps these days have no prob booting from a cd
[02:31] <magickal1> Here is the question of the day, Can you revert an installation?  I need to revert back to Dapper Edgy is just TOO unstable
[02:31] <nofxx> JohnM555 , in theory, not.. xD
[02:31] <JohnM555> nofxx: lol ok
[02:31] <LjL> botxj: if you mean that you won't be able to play DRM protected content, probably yes
[02:31] <Jordan_U> strabes: sudo apt-get install alsa-oss then run the application, but with aoss in front of it like: aoss firefox
[02:31] <Suspekt> iter, yeah i was trying to use raidtools but it turns out edgy don't come with it or somesuch
[02:31] <botxj> i so dont understand DRM
[02:31] <iter> Suspekt: raidtools is depricated
[02:32] <Lonnie> I have managed to boot off three CDs with that machine, hell, it won't even boot up a win98 CD there ailean.  ;-)
[02:32] <Terminus> magickal1: downgrades aren't supported.
[02:32] <ailean> magickal1, how do you find it unstable? I have to say, i haven't had any problems
[02:32] <iter> Suspekt: mdadm replaces it
[02:32] <Lahey> ailean, should i go with the newest one?
[02:32] <zspada15> botxj: its just infinitive prime numbers
[02:32] <strabes> Jordan_U: awesome man thanks for your help
[02:32] <Jordan_U> strabes: np
[02:32] <ailean> Lonnie, can i take it you know how to set the bios settings? I don't want to insult your intelligence :)
[02:32] <Suspekt> iter, gotcha, so does the file i put into /etc/raidtab need to be removed?
[02:32] <xp_prg> what is the command to install vncserver?
[02:32] <magickal1> ailean, random system lockups, Its like running Windows95
[02:32] <iter> ailean: if Lonnie can get debian installed he better be able to get into the bios :p
[02:32] <JohnM555> Ugh, it never finds my AP, but it finds my neighbors, even though I don't get a signal from it
[02:33] <c_lisp> what port do Azureus need to be
[02:33] <iter> Suspekt: yes
[02:33] <Terminus> magickal1: can't you just reinstall? this is one instance where putting /home in a different partition is useful.
[02:33] <Suspekt> k
[02:33] <c_lisp> it keeps complaining
[02:33] <Terminus> !aptitude | xp_prg
[02:33] <ubotu> xp_prg: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[02:33] <ailean> Lahey, the newest one IS stable, but the 6.06 one has support for longer. if you want to update every sixth months, go for edgy
[02:33] <Lonnie> NP there either, yep, have been switching that BIOS between floppy and CD for about four years now.
[02:33] <inglor> hey, just installed dapper, about to patch it to edgy with the update manager
[02:33] <ailean> iter, i know :)
[02:33] <magickal1>  /home is on an entirely different drive
[02:33] <nofxx> JohnM555 , check if your AP is broadcasting the SSID
[02:33] <Suspekt> iter, rm-ed
[02:33] <JohnM555> nofxx: Its not, does it need to be?
[02:33] <floppyears> hi
[02:33] <ailean> magickal1, you're sure it isn't anything to do with your hardware? does it behave this way under, for example, winXP?
[02:33] <inglor> ailean, what do you mean dapper has support for longer? doesn't edgy have support for 6 months more?
[02:33] <LjL> !lts | inglor
[02:33] <ubotu> inglor: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[02:33] <Terminus> inglor: dapper has 5 year support.
[02:33] <Lonnie> Thanks iter, I needed that.
[02:33] <JohnM555> nofxx: It was working in Windowx without it broadcasting
[02:34] <floppyears> I have a set of files on the server that I'm working on, and I would like to backup the files on a nightly basis
[02:34] <Lahey> ailean, ill stick with Dapper then
[02:34] <ailean> inglor, no, Dapper has LTS status, and Edgy doesn't.
[02:34] <iter> floppyears: rsync
[02:34] <JohnM555> nofxx: Its working on my laptop(this computer) without it broadcasting
[02:34] <zspada15> LTS?
[02:34] <Jordan_U> xp_prg, note that in edgy, apt can now also remember what dependencies were installed with a progam and remove them automatically also.
[02:34] <zspada15> !LTS
[02:34] <ubotu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[02:34] <ailean> Lahey, you can always upgrade later if you change your mind
[02:34] <inglor> LjL and ailean, thanks, I didn't know that
[02:34] <nofxx> JohnM555 , yeah... it suppose to work, but that answer the question why you can't see...
[02:34] <floppyears> can rsync be used to copy the files over to another box and to copy only the files that have been modified ?
[02:34] <magickal1> XP is on another drive ( 3 HDDs on the system )  no Ive been running Ubuntu on the smame hardware for 18 months
[02:34] <Lahey> ailean, is it simple to upgrade
[02:34] <iter> floppyears: yes and yes
[02:34] <inglor> will the next release that will come after dapper have LTS>
[02:34] <inglor> *?
[02:34] <magickal1> So yeah this is the upgrade
[02:34] <JohnM555> nofxx: Alright thanks I'll go change it.
[02:34] <zspada15> ailean: sudo apt-get distupgrade
[02:34] <inglor> *after edgy
[02:34] <nofxx> JohnM555 , there is a cool app "Wifi-radar"
[02:34] <ailean> Lahey, once you get the basics of how Ubuntu works, yes. VERY simple. it's one line actually.
[02:34] <JohnM555> nofxx: I have that actually
[02:34] <nofxx> JohnM555 , maybe it could help ya
[02:35] <Lonnie> Thank you all, I will probably just have to leave Debian on that old box and get something a Bit newer for one fo the *buntus.
[02:35] <JohnM555> nofxx: I swear Ive tried everything
[02:35] <Lahey> ailean: Ok i should tell you, I have never used Linux before
[02:35] <JohnM555> nofxx: That app has a problem connecting
[02:35] <ailean> Lahey, sudo apt-get distupgrade upgrades the whole OS :)
[02:35] <Terminus> magickal1: if you want to downgrade, i'd say just backup all your data and reinstall.
[02:35] <magickal1> no clue in the logs. syslog.messages dmesg  X locks up hard  no mouse  netowrk dies
[02:35] <Lahey> ailean: os that where i can download programs the I want
[02:35] <ailean> Lahey, well, be careful not to overwrite your data. have backups. but it's very easy to install and this chan is here to help
[02:36] <maria> does anyone know how to change the owner of a folder?
[02:36] <JohnM555> nofxx: What mode do you use, Managed?
[02:36] <floppyears> thanks iter
[02:36] <maria> to myself from root?
[02:36] <nofxx> JohnM555 , I wish I could help you more... but I'm new in linux too.... and I'm lost too
[02:36] <LjL> maria: chown
[02:36] <nofxx> JohnM555 , yes.. managed is when you connect to a AP, ad-hoc for no ap
[02:36] <ailean> Lahey, OS = operating system
[02:36] <JohnM555> nofxx: Any help is good
[02:36] <inglor> hey, does the new rhythembox in edgy have the ability to fully communicate (add songs) with the iPod as people told me?
[02:36] <Lahey> ailean: i ment to say is
[02:36] <magickal1> This is why I have multipul HDD's  :)  Ill grab an older disk and go from there
[02:36] <doctorow> I have Ubuntu Edgy on a Thinkpad T60p; I just rebooted and when I went into "Network settings" my WiFi wasn't visible. I rebooted again and Ethernet wasn't visible anymore either. Help!
[02:36] <JohnM555> nofxx: How long is your key, and do you have -'s in between it?
[02:36] <Terminus> maria: 'sudo chown owner:group foo'
[02:37] <Lonnie> Thanks all, later.
[02:37] <ailean> inglor, i don't know if edgy+1 will have LTS. probably not
[02:37] <magickal1> Thanks for the time
[02:37] <JohnM555> nofxx: Mine is 10, I'm not sure if thats normal or not
[02:37] <Terminus> LTS is probably more like edgy+3 =)
[02:37] <inglor> dortorow, where did you go to network settings in? edgy? try running ifconfig and see what it spits
[02:37] <ailean> Lahey, yes, using apt. But not everything is textual. There is a graphical tool to download your programs
[02:37] <c_lisp> what prot does Azureus need to be on?
[02:37] <doctorow> inglor: ifconfig only shows lo -- no ethernet interfaces
[02:38] <Lahey>  I have never seen this kind of support in my life, this is great!!!
[02:38] <juca_truca> hi!!!!
[02:38] <no0tic> why in edgy there isn't anymore specific kernels?
[02:38] <Jordan_U> Lahey: To install applications, you can go to Applications -> add remove, for command line apps and more advanced features you can use System -> Administration -> Synaptic, and from the command line you can use apt-get.
[02:38] <Suspekt> iter, $ Error opening dev/md0/ no such file or directory
[02:38] <Terminus> c_lisp: you can set it to whatever you want. generally, i use 6881-6889(default) for bt stuff though.
[02:38] <inglor> doctorow, try iwconfig, anything?
[02:38] <Suspekt> no0tic, i was curious about that myself
[02:38] <JohnM555> I've had so many people try to help me...I think they all give up though :)
[02:38] <inglor> doctorow, did you try checking your BIOS?
[02:38] <nofxx> JohnM555 , dont remember... I was trying WPA.. then now it wont connect even with open system .... its really annoying
[02:38] <juca_truca> anyone can help me to install java in my browser???
[02:38] <Lahey> ailean: Ok, ill run it and see how it is, also can i cluster with this OS
[02:38] <ailean> Lahey, youll learn, little by little. But you can start with almost no knowledge
[02:38] <doctorow> inglor: it says "no wireless extenions"
[02:38] <JohnM555> nofxx: ok
[02:39] <doctorow> inglor: I don't know how to check my BIOS
[02:39] <ailean> Lahey, what do you want to do exactly?
[02:39] <Jordan_U> !java | juca_truca
[02:39] <Lahey> ailean: perfect!
[02:39] <ubotu> juca_truca: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[02:39] <maria> Terminus, i did it, and got no error, but the folder still belongs to root?
[02:39] <Terminus> juca_truca: sudo aptitude install sun-java5-jre
[02:39] <c_lisp> gets error
[02:39] <Terminus> maria: what exactly did you type?
[02:39] <JohnM555> nofxx: Do you happen to know the program that cracks wep keys...maybe it will magically work on my wireless
[02:39] <ailean> Lahey, the short answer is yes, anyway
[02:39] <maria> sudo chown maria /media/mydvd
[02:40] <inglor> doctorow, reboot your computer and tap F2 constantly (if it's a centrino), then see if all the wireless and wired extensions are available
[02:40] <Lahey> ailean: im looking for a desktop and maybe server OS, that I can scale later on, such as adding another machine to form a cluster or something
[02:40] <maria> Terminus :sudo chown maria /media/mydvd
[02:40] <ailean> Lahey, http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux_cluster.html
[02:40] <ailean> Lahey, it's linux. Linux clusters
[02:40] <inglor> doctorow, if you have an external usb wifi card for example, try hooking it to the computer and see if it detects it, that could isolate the problem
[02:40] <Terminus> maria: and /media/mydvd is your dvd drive? you'll have to alter fstab for that i think.
[02:40] <maria> terminus : its not its just a folder i made
[02:40] <Suspekt> iter, ...sudo helps lol
[02:40] <Lahey> ailean: i was just on this site, very good link
[02:41] <maria> terminus : i was going to copy some files into it and make it the cdrom for wine
[02:41] <ailean> Lahey, how do you think i found it? :)
[02:41] <doctorow> inglor I don't have any external cards -- this is just tjhe stuff that came  with the thinkpad
[02:41] <Terminus> maria: and maria is a valid username? 'try sudo chown maria:maria /media/mydvd'
[02:41] <thor> my usb drive automounts in gnome, but I normally run enlightenment. Anyone know how to get it to automount in e (or fluxbox, etc)?
[02:41] <Suspekt> iter, nope that didn't work eatehr
[02:41] <juca_truca> thanks
[02:41] <doctorow> inglor I've entered the "BIOS Setup Untility"
[02:41] <juca_truca> it's work
[02:41] <inglor> doctorow, see if you can find anything about the wireless there
[02:42] <ailean> Lahey, do try out the Live CD before installing anything, okay?
[02:42] <maria> terminus : no error, but its still belonging to root
[02:42] <Lahey> ailean: you are a linux help god.
[02:42] <nofxx> JohnM555 , i can't find... my bookmark are worst then my room.. xD
[02:42] <harusari> anybody could suggest a brainstorming program like "mindmap"?
[02:42] <Lahey> ailean: I will, and ill tell you all about it
[02:42] <Lahey> lol
[02:42] <ailean> Lahey, no, you'll meet them when you have some real problems
[02:42] <ailean> Lahey, i'm a bit of a newbie
[02:42] <JohnM555> nofxx: haha its ok :)
[02:42] <ailean> Lahey, but I'm well able to help you :)
[02:42] <LjL> !find mindmap | harusari
[02:43] <ubotu> Package/file mindmap does not exist in edgy
[02:43] <Terminus> maria: what does 'ls -l /media/mydvd' say? sounds more like a permission problem than an ownership problem.
[02:43] <Alethes> anybody have issues using imap on the latest evolution?
[02:43] <Terminus> maria: 'ls -l /media' i mean.
[02:43] <harusari> LjL, is there a mindmap on ubuntu?
[02:43] <Lahey> ailean: Ok this is my second time on IRC, beat that. I AM KING n00b
[02:43] <LjL> harusari: nevermind the bot :-\ there's this three:  kdissert - mindmapping tool          planfacile - Generate a document from a mindmap         vym - mindmapping tool
[02:43] <iter> Suspekt: obviously all that needs to be run as root
[02:43] <nofxx> JohnM555 , i even saw a video about this program for linux... lots of plugins for cracking stuff...hmmm.....will have to remember...
[02:43] <ailean> Lahey, well, listen to me then. TRY THE LIVE CD BEFORE INSTALLING :)
[02:43] <maria> Terminus, it says its owned by me
[02:44] <doctorow> inglor It says "Internal Wireless Device Enabled" and "Internal Network Device enabled"
[02:44] <Terminus> maria: can you paste the line for mydvd?
[02:44] <Suspekt> iter, sudo won't work... it won't allow me to create the device it seems
[02:44] <JohnM555> nofxx: I'm looking now, but if I'll find it is another story
[02:44] <Lahey> ailean: I will,,
[02:44] <harusari> LjL, i'll find them, thanx
[02:44] <maria> d--------- 2 maria maria 4096 2006-11-08 20:23 mydvd
[02:44] <LjL> harusari: they're all Qt though, except for planfacile, which doesn't list any dependencies
[02:44] <ailean> Lahey, but that said, there's only one way to learn, and I learned by installing when it was much more difficult
[02:44] <JohnM555> And I need to go in 15, can't miss lost :)
[02:44] <LjL> harusari: find them?
[02:44] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell harusari about packages
[02:44] <LjL> harusari: you shouldn't have to search for them
[02:44] <inglor> doctorow, try downloading a windows xp live CD and checking if it's a software<-> ACPI issue, also are there any hardware switches maybe you just didn't click the right ones
[02:44] <Terminus> maria: 'chmod 0755 /media/mydvd'
[02:44] <iter> Suspekt: mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1
[02:45] <cryptonic> how do i check what graphics driver is on default?
[02:45] <nofxx> JohnM555 , huahua found it http://midnightresearch.com/projects/wicrawl/
[02:45] <Lahey> V i have nothing but time, i think i will enjoy this very much.
[02:45] <iter> Suspekt: (assuming your drives are hda and hdb)
[02:45] <Suspekt> iter yeah thats the exact syntax i did... im going to try it doing a sudo bash first right?
[02:45] <inglor> cryptonic, what do you mean?
[02:45] <JohnM555> Thanks :)
[02:45] <maria> Terminus, hey it worked, i just dont know what i did :) im sure this would of just been easier to mount my dvdrom on my other computer to this one, but im so lost its amazing
[02:45] <cryptonic> nvidia drivers
[02:45] <Lahey> ailean: is there anything else i should know
[02:45] <iter> Suspekt: right, and you have to have hda1 hdb1 too
[02:45] <cryptonic> i installed the new ones but dont think there working
[02:46] <doctorow> inglor I have never used Windows and the machine doesn't presently have an optical drive (I pulled out the optical and installed another SATA HDD). I can reinstall the optical drive, but I have no idea how to do anything in XP
[02:46] <Terminus> maria: it was a permissions problem. chown changed the owner just fine. =)
[02:46] <maria> Terminus, want to help me mount my dvd rom from my windows pc to this one :) ?
[02:46] <JohnM555> Now I need to figure out how to install a tgz file
[02:46] <Suspekt> iter, it still says error opening md0 no such file or directory
[02:46] <ailean> Lahey, if you have trouble, throw in the disc again, and boot back up. you can get back into this channel through the instant mesenger program. take note of the server name and the channel and you can ask whatever questions you like
[02:46] <cryptonic> inglor : nvidia drivers
[02:47] <inglor> crypronic, you mean the version?
[02:47] <cryptonic> yeah
[02:47] <iter> Suspekt: are the partitions in use?
[02:47] <Suspekt> iter good point let me maker sure they are not mounted
[02:47] <ailean> Lahey, but i have my mother and father in-law using Ubuntu. If they can do it, so can you
[02:47] <iter> Suspekt: you should not have a /dev/md0 until you run that command
[02:47] <inglor> doctorow, hmm, no optical drive... lemme see
[02:48] <cryptonic> inglor : yeah
[02:48] <Jordan_U> cryptonic: run glxinfo | grep direct and post the output.
[02:48] <doctorow> inglor I just rebooted after checking the BIOS and it's showing my ethernet but not my wifi
[02:48] <Suspekt> iter, right, thats why that isn't a very good error message lol
[02:48] <inglor> doctorow, this sounds odd, my guess would be an hardware error
[02:48] <Lahey> ailean: OMG, im just glad there is so much support for linux, Thanks You So Much....

[02:51] <cryptonic> inglor : dunno, when booting from live cd i have to use noapic
[02:51] <maria> anyone know how to mount a samba mounted folder, to a permanent folder?
[02:51] <ailean> max_, did you show the hidden folders? it might be under the /home/user/.KAudioCreator/ folder...
[02:51] <LjL> maria, you need to add a line to /etc/fstab
[02:52] <javaJake> I'm trying to get 3D acell working, a common problem to be sure. Xorg.0.log reports that it has enabled Direct Rendering, but glxinfo says something different. Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/820115 Xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/820120 Syslog: http://pastebin.com/820118

[02:52] <bruenig> tw|sT3d, why should you?
[02:52] <ailean> tw|sT3d, maybe your modem isn't installed

[02:53] <javaJake> maria, It is samba enhanced. It is more stable (samba freezes for many at login and at boot)
[02:54] <socomm> maria: Trying to mount a smb share?
[02:54] <Lahey> ailean: Ok good, i dont want to take up you time, there are people out there that need you! Thanks for the help! YOU ROCK
[02:54] <maria> socomm : yeah
[02:54] <javaJake> I'm trying to get 3D acell working, a common problem to be sure. Xorg.0.log reports that it has enabled Direct Rendering, but glxinfo says something different. Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/820115 Xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/820120 Syslog: http://pastebin.com/820118
[02:54] <socomm> maria: Try smbmount.

[02:55] <javaJake> ;)
[02:55] <ailean> javaJake, you irish?
[02:55] <Suspekt> iter thats what i did
[02:55] <javaJake> ailean, No
[02:55] <ailean> tw|sT3d, i've never had to do that. sorry
[02:55] <Terminus> !CIFS
[02:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about CIFS - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:55] <xeem> Ty, so Q: I have a problem stopping x. I use "telinit 3" and kill manager, but asap I log in the x server starts itself back. How can I prevent it from stopping and stay in shell. (I can't find inittab and those rcN files in /etc/event.d don't help). Thank you.
[02:55] <javaJake> ailean, Well, there's a bit of Irish in me, but not a lot
[02:55] <maria> javaJake, how do i install it? i tried apt-get install cifs and it didnt find anything
[02:55] <Terminus> heh, thought ubotu was case sensitive.
[02:55] <ailean> javaJake, i saw the "to be sure" :)
[02:55] <tw|sT3d> how did u install ur modem?
[02:55] <iter> Suspekt: are sda1 and sdb1 the same size?
[02:55] <cryptonic> airlean : Hurray for Ireland
[02:55] <javaJake> ailean, Oh, heheh, yea, well....
[02:56] <Suspekt> iter, yes
[02:56] <ailean> tw|sT3d, i have a cable modem. didn't need to install ethernet access
[02:56] <Terminus> maria: aptitude install smbfs
[02:56] <javaJake> Is anyone here experienced with Xorg to help me?
[02:56] <tw|sT3d> =((
[02:56] <apokryphos> !anyone
[02:56] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:56] <javaJake> Xorg.0.log reports that it has enabled Direct Rendering, but glxinfo says something different. Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/820115 Xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/820120 Syslog: http://pastebin.com/820118
[02:56] <cryptonic> ailean : Hurray for Ireland
[02:56] <Suspekt> iter, its possible this is an issue with my 'hardware' raid provided by the promise controler
[02:56] <Jordan_U> cryptonic: OK, run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" and choose the nvidea driver when prompted.
[02:56] <ailean> cryptonic, i'm scottish :)
[02:57] <iter> Suspekt: might be but I doubt it
[02:57] <apokryphos> javaJake:         Option          "RenderAccel" "false" #More stable this way... I think
[02:57] <apokryphos> javaJake: and that comment is wrong
[02:57] <javaJake> apokryphos, Yuck yuck, doy. :D
[02:57] <Suspekt> iter, ok... the goal is to get this raid working with both sides...  my linux box and my DirectX9 box
[02:57] <javaJake> apokryphos, I'll give it the good ol' shot.
[02:58] <eobanb> is there a way to use the rss-glx screensavers (flurry, lattice, etc.) with xscreensaver instead of just gnome-screensaver?
[02:58] <apokryphos> javaJake: so s/false/true/
[02:58] <iter> Suspekt: perhaps this link might help
[02:58] <eobanb> i switched to xscreensaver and now i can't see the rss-glx screensavers
[02:58] <freeze> hey
[02:58] <javaJake> apokryphos, Yep
[02:58] <iter> Suspekt: http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html
[02:58] <xeem> Anyone willing to have a short private chat with me about my "bootlevel" problem? In here it is quite messy.
[02:58] <Suspekt> iter, is it because i am attempting to use vfat
[02:58] <freeze> does your system have to be up to date when using gksudo "update-manager -c"
[02:58] <freeze> ?
[02:58] <skelter> is there any news on the eclipse problem with 64bit edgy systems?
[02:58] <cryptonic> Jordan_U how do i use the latest drivers, is it nvidia or nv drivers i choose?
[02:59] <apokryphos> javaJake: though actually I've never used ATI, so I'm not sure if hardware acceleration is enabled in the same way
[02:59] <ailean> okay, now i have a question. i set up my GRUB with a selection for Windows, which is installed on my 2nd (slave) hard disc.  It works. No problem there.  But whenever I load up Windows from GRUB, the second (slave) hard disc claims the boot again and just launches windows instead of going to GRUB. what can i do?
[02:59] <iter> Suspekt: don't know
[02:59] <javaJake> apokryphos, well, worth a shot
[02:59] <freeze> bc im on 6.06 and i used that command and i dont se  " New distribution release '6.10' is available, UPGRADE"
[02:59] <apokryphos> certainly
[02:59] <iter> Suspekt: bbialb
[02:59] <Suspekt> iter, bbialb?
[02:59] <javaJake> apokryphos, BRB... going to try that
[03:00] <xeem> Q: I have a problem stopping X. I use "telinit 3" and kill manager, but asap I log in to console, the x server starts itself back. How can I prevent it from stopping and stay in shell. (I can't find inittab and those rcN files in /etc/event.d don't help). Thank you
[03:00] <Flannel> freeze: is all of your stuff up to date currently?
[03:00] <chewy> when Xorg bitches about fonts what do i need to do to fix it
[03:00] <chewy> when it won't start cause of it
[03:00] <boggle> cryptonic: I think this is covered in help.ubuntu.com, how to use the nvidia and ati drivers
[03:00] <Jordan_U> cryptonic: nvidea.
[03:00] <freeze> Flannel no
[03:00] <freeze> says 188 updates
[03:01] <powercat> I got beryl installed, but for some reason it's not showing any of the "window decorator" I'm using nvidia
[03:01] <freeze> i just installed 6.06 without knowing about 6.10
[03:01] <Ashley`> On two of my Ubuntu Edgy upgrades, clicking a location from the Places menu sometimes spawns a random number of new instances of the nautilus file browser. Is anyone else having this problem?
[03:01] <chewy> i cant start Xgl cause it crys about fonts
[03:01] <chewy> powercat: i'm having trouble with Xgl
[03:01] <ailean> powercat, did you type "beryl-manager" in a terminal?
[03:01] <Flannel> freeze: 6.06? or 6.06.1?  you'll want to be up-to-date before upgrading, or at least, have update-manager up to date
[03:01] <chewy> powercat: its crying about fonts
[03:01] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell chewy about xgl
[03:01] <Jordan_U> freeze: then it will take less downloading / time to download the Edgy CD.
[03:01] <powercat> ailean: It's already opened. When I choose beryl as my manager, all windows lose their borders and the X at the corner. It's just a square.
[03:01] <freeze> flannel how do i check
[03:02] <freeze> edgy cd kept freezing
[03:02] <powercat> chewy: I'm as much a noob as you are. I wouldn't know
[03:02] <freeze> so i made a dapper cd
[03:02] <ailean> powercat, sounds like it's not installed properly. there is a channel set up for these problems at #ubuntu-xgl
[03:02] <Flannel> freeze: check what?  6.06 or 6.06.1?  there's no difference, you'd have to check which ISO you downloaded.  If you just got it, it's most likely 6.06.1, but anyway, that's far less important.  Update update-manager (I believe the upgrade howto mentions that) then try again
[03:03] <B_166-ER-X> what would be a goog Benchmark program for the CPU , on ubuntu ?
[03:03] <powercat> Thanks ailean
[03:03] <ailean> powercat, np
[03:03] <inglor> you guys still here? I'm getting an odd error, can't ping google
[03:03] <freeze> flannel i dont see anything about updating update-manager
[03:04] <calamari> hi
[03:04] <Jordan_U> inglor: Are you connected with ethernet or wireless?
[03:04] <LjL> inglor: can you ping 209.85.135.99 ?
[03:04] <inglor> Jordan_U, ethernet
[03:05] <inglor> LjL, yeah, I can
[03:05] <Flannel> freeze: you're right.  It's not in there.  Anyway, you'll want to update update-manager then try again
[03:05] <Hyperion2010> if my livecd kernel panics on me, is there anything I can do to get around it?
[03:05] <LjL> inglor: then i guess your DNS settings are wrong... can you ping other sites, or reach them in the browser?
[03:05] <Languid> hi im trying to install edgy on my desktop computer which has two HDs set up as RAID0.  the edgy installer sees them as two 160GB drives when it should be one.  is there anyway i can get ubuntu to recognize them as a RAID drives?
[03:05] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Hyperion2010 about install
[03:05] <freeze> flannel, thanks got it :)
[03:05] <freeze> i see 6.10 upgrade available now
[03:05] <freeze> teehehe
[03:05] <freeze> tyvm
[03:05] <Suspekt> iter, any suggestions?
[03:05] <calamari> my smokey blue icon theme seems to be gone now that I upgraded to edgy.  I tracked it down to the package gnome-themes.  The description still mentions the theme, but I guess it was forgotten.  Any ideas how to get it back?
[03:06] <javaJake> apokryphos, That didn't work
[03:06] <inglor> LjL, nope, it worked fine a minute ago
[03:06] <freeze> re instasll it
[03:06] <tom_> china
[03:06] <Jordan_U> Hyperion2010: Yes, you can change the kernel parameters at boot, try for instastance adding: noapci
[03:06] <LjL> inglor, check the nameserver entry (if any) in /etc/resolv.conf and make sure it's the actual DNS server
[03:06] <tom_> new york
[03:06] <Hyperion2010> ok, I'll look into it, thanks
[03:06] <tom_> distance
[03:06] <freeze> hey how do i change the word after @ sign in terminal
[03:06] <apokryphos> javaJake: I just suggest checking google if you already checked in the ubuntu wiki guide for ati trivers
[03:06] <empty_mind> can i  install a package from edgy into a drapper box ?
[03:07] <Hyperion2010> btw, is there anyway to just dump an install on a partition, and then compile a kernel from another linux environment?
[03:07] <LjL> empty_mind: no
[03:07] <javaJake> apokryphos, But what do I google? The logs all have sucess messages. Nothing error-ish.
[03:07] <LjL> empty_mind: you can possibly get the source package and compile it
[03:07] <inglor> LjL, got two entries,
[03:07] <inglor> not sure if they're right or not
[03:07] <freeze> empty...you could but it might depend on another app which might depend on another and it will just all need to be upgraded
[03:07] <FidO-DidO> xchat update the channel list when I enter in a server, what I can do to stop it????
[03:07] <apokryphos> javaJake: well you're not going to get an error if you haven't declared the option properly. Google something like direct rendering ati linux
[03:07] <LjL> inglor: what are they
[03:07] <Languid> hi im trying to install edgy on my desktop computer which has two HDs set up as RAID0.  the edgy installer sees them as two 160GB drives when it should be one.  is there anyway i can get ubuntu to recognize them as a RAID drives?  anyone?
[03:07] <Jordan_U> Hyperion2010: Do you have another Linux machine?
[03:08] <pudland> whats the fglrx command to test the driver?
[03:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Languid about raid
[03:08] <javaJake> apokryphos, Except it worked BEFORE I compiled in the latest git/cvs drm, Mesa, and xf86-driver-ati
[03:08] <Hyperion2010> I'm running on a gentoo install right now
[03:08] <eobanb> pudland, you mean glxinfo?
[03:08] <Jordan_U> Hyperion2010: If so, you can create your own custom LiveCD with a custom kernel.
[03:08] <pudland> that works
[03:08] <inglor> nameserver 192.168.101.101
[03:08] <inglor> nameserver 192.168.101.102
[03:08] <FidO-DidO> pudland: fglrxgears or something like that
[03:08] <Flannel> !tell Hyperion2010 about install
[03:08] <inglor> I'm connected through ehternet to a modem
[03:08] <inglor> that's connected through cable to the www
[03:09] <Flannel> Hyperion2010: believe theres a howto on that page for just what you're doing
[03:09] <Hyperion2010> ok, great, thanks
[03:09] <FidO-DidO> xchat update the channel list when I enter in a server, what I can do to stop it????
[03:09] <pudland> fido-dido: its something close, cant remember though
[03:09] <javaJake> apokryphos, Except the logs say "Direct Rendering enabled"!
[03:09] <apokryphos> javaJake: sounds like a bug in those latest things then
[03:09] <LjL> inglor: 192.168.101.101 is possibly the address of your modem
[03:10] <FidO-DidO> pudland: use the tab completion
[03:10] <inglor> that would be my guess, so basically there is nothing I can do?
[03:10] <Jordan_U> Hyperion2010: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues ( comment stolen from Ubotu )
[03:10] <pudland> fido-dido: ?????
[03:10] <FidO-DidO> fgl_glxgears
[03:10] <pudland> fido-dido: ahhhhh
[03:10] <LjL> inglor: fix your modem's built-in DNS proxy, if it's broken, or set your DNS manually to something else - like the DNS servers from your ISP (which you should find somewhere in your ISP's site)
[03:10] <javaJake> apokryphos, Maybe... but I'd rather narrow it down first.
[03:11] <LjL> inglor: 212.245.255.2 is a DNS server that should work, though very slowly
[03:11] <pudland> fido-dido: perfect!!! thanks
[03:11] <Jordan_U> pudland: glxinfo | grep direct
[03:11] <inglor> lemme see if the welcome cable page works, it's supposed to work even if I'm not connected
=== tom_ is now known as pokemon
[03:11] <Suspekt> do you HAVE to use the 'raid-autodetect' filesystem for RAID to work in linux??
[03:11] <Jordan_U> pudland: If it says "direct rendering = yes" then they are installed correctly.
=== pokemon is now known as charizardrulz
[03:11] <calamari> ahh I see.. they removed it.. stupid gnome retards
[03:11] <M0E-lnx> does ubuntu install debian packages too?
[03:11] <pudland> fgl gives 350fps w/ pci 9200
[03:12] <inglor> the odd thing is that it worked just fine until about a minute ago
[03:12] <apokryphos> M0E-lnx: it uses .debs, but installing debian packages on ubuntu can cause real problems
[03:12] <M0E-lnx> aahh.
[03:12] <M0E-lnx> anyone know where I could find an ubuntu package for rp-pppoe
[03:12] <M0E-lnx> I installed it, but can't get online to do anything

[03:15] <powercat> How do I change my screen depth from 32 to 24 in xorg.conf?
[03:15] <inglor> LjL, done, now do I try to ping?
[03:15] <eobanb> powercat, 32 is the same as 24.  32 is just 24 with 8 bits of alpha channel

[03:22] <inglor> mnepton, I don't drink coca cola, I could however use a beer
[03:22] <zliners> fisrt of all i am a huge noob :D
[03:22] <_`casey> beer is fantastic.
[03:22] <inglor> doctorow, I honestly don't know how to help you, I'm guessing it is an hardware error

[03:22] <doctorow> inglor I'm really stuck here. I've futzed with the BIOS a bunch. Sometimes I boot and it sees the Ethernet, sometimes it doesn't. It never sees the WiFi

[03:22] <zliners> i inted  to learn with experimentation
[03:22] <doctorow> inglor Thanks
[03:22] <inglor> zliners, google a bash guide, it's pretty simple
[03:23] <Jordan_U> zliners: cd into the directory the source files are in, then run: javac filename

[03:24] <variant> zliners: you will need a jdk installed
[03:24] <Jordan_U> zliners: man javac, a good command to remember is "apropos" it will give you the names of apps having to do with a given word :)
[03:24] <youser> guys how do i navigate in terminal to folders with spaces inthe names/

[03:25] <doctorow> mnepton I'm using the WiFi that came stock with the ThinkPad -- dunno whether it's MadWiFi
[03:26] <Flannel> youser: remember it's case sensitive, but tab completion works, and will work on inserting slashes for spaces too
[03:26] <inglor> zliners, there isn't really that much to know about it
[03:26] <mnepton> doctorow: probably the Intel 3945abg
[03:26] <zliners> :D
[03:26] <zliners> Jordan_U javac filename => dous thad also work fopr a dir ?
[03:26] <inglor> zliners, unless you LIKE to mess with it, which is half the fun
[03:27] <mnepton> doctorow: fire a phone number at kurt@ubuntu.com and i'll call you from the Googleplex and see if i can't help you get it sorted.
[03:27] <zliners> i am messing with it ;)
[03:27] <Droit> Can someone here help me? I just installed Ubuntu 6.10 and i can't find my files anymore
[03:27] <Jordan_U> youser: folder name = folder\ name = "folder name" ( you can use quotes intead of escaping each space )
[03:27] <jws> I have a puzzling installation problem. Once the X portion fires up, I see the screen resolution change, but the remains black. The keyboard goes dead- even capslock and numlock are unresponsive. Both mouse and keyboard are usb. Ideas?
[03:27] <inglor> Droit, which files?
[03:27] <doctorow> mnepton Thanks! Mail sent
[03:27] <pcgigabyte> I have lost the top panel in ubuntu. How can I reset the top panel and bottom panel back to default?
[03:28] <Jordan_U> zliners: To compile everything in a given directory, cd into the directory and run: javac *.java
[03:28] <Flannel> pcgigabyte: right click near the top, "add panel" then on the panel right click, "add to panel", etc
[03:28] <Jordan_U> pcgigabyte: killall gnome-panel
[03:29] <pcgigabyte> jordan if I type that will it reset them all to default?
[03:29] <Droit> inglor: All my files on my other hard drives. I'm back to using win XP because i can't find nothing on Ubuntu, it's like my hard drives don't exist anymore
[03:29] <Jordan_U> pcgigabyte: No, I thought you meant that it just didn't show up, not that you deleted it, sorry :(
[03:29] <inglor> Droit, what fileformat is your other hard drive using?
[03:29] <pcgigabyte> Lol I deleted it
[03:29] <pcgigabyte> is there a way to reset them back to default?
[03:30] <Flannel> pcgigabyte: right click near the top, "add panel" then on the panel right click, "add to panel", then re-add all the stuff
[03:30] <youser> damnit im trying to install propellerheads reason on linux
[03:30] <youser> not easy
[03:30] <zliners> Jordan_U witch compiler do u suggest ?
[03:30] <pcgigabyte> flannel I just to reset them. Not add all stuff again. Is there a way to reset all of it?
[03:30] <Droit> inglor: NTFS
[03:30] <zliners> cause i cant fint javac in my apt
[03:31] <ailean> youser, under wine?
[03:31] <zliners> *find
[03:31] <Suspekt> iter, any suggestions?
[03:31] <youser> yep
[03:31] <Flannel> pcgigabyte: no.  Just re-add the stuff, its not too bad
[03:31] <youser> after first cd it said installed, then it said cant run cuz gui had problems
[03:31] <inglor> Droit, NTFS is very problematic with linux but it tends to work, reading the files should work but writing and modifying them tends to be problematic, I suggest using FAT32 to share data between windows and linux
=== Drop is now known as Q[^_^] Q
[03:32] <Jordan_U> zliners: I used plain old javac when I was taking java classes, but I prefer python now and I havn't really tried any other java compilers.
[03:32] <ailean> youser, the reason gui is very advanced
[03:32] <youser> i know
[03:32] <Droit> inglor: Ok, sure, but i have a 120 gig hard drive formatted in NTFS and i can't re-format it without loosing all my files.
[03:32] <ailean> youser, it has bouncy cables and twisting windows...
[03:32] <youser> but i had saw stories on ubuntuforums of it working
[03:33] <tich_> i installed flash9 beta and it isn't working, what steps should i take to fix it?
[03:33] <ailean> youser, cool
[03:33] <Droit> inglor: I can't read them if i can't even find them
[03:33] <worstenboy> hi zliners ;)
[03:33] <zliners> hi wosr :d
[03:33] <youser> i used to use reason on windows
[03:33] <inglor> Droit, can't you resize it?
[03:33] <Jordan_U> zliners: If you are new to programming I highly reccommend python though :)
[03:33] <youser> is possibly my graphics card not good enough to run on ubuntu?
[03:33] <_`casey> NTFS-3G
[03:33] <_`casey> Works like a charm for me.
[03:33] <ailean> youser, what is your card?
[03:33] <inglor> youser, doubtly, my 915 built in intel can run ubuntu smoothly with AIGLX and BERYL
[03:33] <youser> no video card
[03:33] <youser> i have built in 4mb graphics
[03:34] <youser> lol
[03:34] <youser> on my old emachines from 2001
[03:34] <ailean> youser, i would say, NO chance
[03:34] <Languid> LjL, hi, i read that page about raid and that doesnt really help me.  im using a hardware sata raid controller (a via vt6420), and already have xp installed on it.  when i boot into the livecd, however, ubuntu recognizes it as two partitions, two separate hard drives.  is there no way for it to recognize it as a raid properly?
[03:34] <youser> cant run it?
[03:34] <ailean> youser, i would doubt it
[03:34] <Jordan_U> youser: You can it without X.
[03:34] <inglor> youser, it can run ubuntu, but I doubt it can run x
[03:34] <youser> errori got is "failed to open gui supportlibrary"
[03:34] <youser> what is x?
[03:35] <Droit> inglor: If you are talking about re-partitionning, i don't know but i'd rather not take the chance of loosing everything.
[03:35] <ailean> youser, did you check the wineHQ?
[03:35] <youser> nope
[03:35] <inglor> youser, x is the graphical bit
[03:35] <nofxx> i saw X with kde on my k6-500 4mb shared memory.... it can
[03:35] <youser> ahh wine graphics?
[03:35] <Droit> inglor: Isn't Ubuntu supposed to be able to "see" the files?
[03:36] <Flannel> Droit: it can, assuming you've mounted the drives
[03:36] <Flannel> !ntfs | Droit
[03:36] <ubotu> Droit: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:36] <Languid> im using a hardware sata raid controller (a via vt6420), and already have xp installed on it.  when i boot into the livecd, however, ubuntu recognizes it as two partitions, two separate hard drives.  is there no way for it to recognize it as a raid properly?
[03:36] <LjL> Languid: i don't know honestly
[03:36] <nofxx> video memory isnt  problem on a 2d situation...
[03:36] <iter> Languid: I saw someone else with the same problem
[03:36] <ailean> youser, it's not listed on www.winehq.com
[03:36] <Languid> iter, any idea what he did?
[03:36] <iter> Languid: we weren't able to solve it
[03:36] <youser> reason 3.0 is a 3d program
[03:37] <youser> i think
[03:37] <inglor> Droit, did you try looking for them in /dev ?
[03:37] <iter> Languid: he ended upusing sw raid via mdadm
[03:37] <Languid> iter, hmm, okay.
[03:37] <nofxx> youser  you asked if you can ran ubuntu with that card
[03:37] <iter> Languid: my guess is that "hardware raid" is acutally fakeraid
[03:37] <iter> Languid: and so you gotta use sw raid in linux
[03:37] <Mantice> Any one know why my Beryl is whiteing out ?
[03:37] <nofxx> if you are going to play a game or develop a game for sure you should know what you need for it
[03:38] <youser> no
[03:38] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Mantice about beryl
[03:38] <youser> i know i can run ubuntu with that card
[03:38] <iter> Mantice: #ubuntu-xgl
[03:38] <youser> since i urrently am
[03:38] <Droit> Flannel: Nope, what's that about mounting drives? they're plugged into the IDE.
[03:38] <Mantice> !beryl
[03:38] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[03:38] <youser> :)
[03:38] <Jordan_U> youser: I would try installing from the alternate install cd without any of the GUI options , then install fluxbox.
[03:38] <youser> alternate install cd?
[03:38] <inglor> mantice, #beryl
[03:38] <youser> i am running linux ubuntu dapper 6.06
[03:39] <Droit> Is there a downloadable document for the Windows users switching to Ubuntu?
[03:39] <youser> im trying to install a program under wine
[03:40] <Madpilot> Droit, not currently, but you could join the Ubuntu Documentation Team & help us finish one for the next release!
[03:40] <inglor> Droit, is it under /dev ?
[03:41] <Jordan_U> inglor: It seems there are more people in #ubuntu-xgl than in #beryl ( currently none )
[03:41] <tekon> Hi all, new to Ubuntu and looking for help getting internet connection
[03:41] <Jordan_U> inglor: ignore that last comment, user error :)
[03:41] <Droit> inglor: I don't think so. i'm pretty sure i looked nearly everywhere
[03:41] <Languid> iter, hmm.. even though i can get into a config screen after the bios to configure the controller?
[03:42] <iter> Languid: yep
[03:42] <sigger_> I just moved a hard drive from a PC with Damn Small Linux to one with Ubuntu.  Does it matter that the users and groups have different uids and gids?  (Sinking feeling in stomach says yes)
[03:42] <Languid> iter, so if it is fakeraid, what do i need to do?
[03:42] <iter> Languid: the other guy had a nice, brand new x series server from ibm
[03:42] <calamari> Droit: ls /dev/hd*
[03:42] <iter> Languid: you want to keep the data on your disks?
[03:42] <Droit> Madpilot: How can i help with documents? I don't know how Ubuntu works. I just barely know how win XP works.
[03:42] <inglor> Droit, tried in /dev/disk ?
[03:42] <youser> ahh my mistake
[03:43] <youser> its known to work on suse
[03:43] <Languid> iter, i would like to dual boot, so yes
[03:43] <youser> and gentoo
[03:43] <iter> Languid: and I assume fs is ntfs on those disks?
[03:43] <Madpilot> Droit, make notes as you discover how it does work. That's how I got started on the docteam last year
[03:43] <Languid> iter, yup
[03:43] <youser> sorry for the confusion
[03:43] <Mantice> Can any one solve why mu azureus is gliching up it does not boot propley
[03:43] <calamari> Droit: what does that command give you?
[03:43] <iter> Languid: sounds like you're going to need another hdd
[03:43] <Droit> inglor: i'm not sure, but i can't check right now coz i'm on win XP. Can't connect to the net with Ubuntu yet
[03:43] <youser> by the way does anyone know how i can organize my xchat room list in order of 3 of ppl
[03:44] <calamari> Droit: ahh ok
[03:44] <youser> # of ppl
[03:44] <iter> Languid: I could be all wet, but I don't know a way to get that raid to boot ubuntu
[03:44] <Languid> iter, that sucks....
[03:44] <iter> :\
[03:44] <calamari> Droit: if you happen to have another system you can connect with, then it will be a lot easier to troubleshoot things hehe
[03:45] <Languid> iter, if i choose to just wipe the xp install, can i actually use the two disks in a raid setup with ubuntu?
[03:45] <Droit> calamari: Ya, i know. The problem with internet support is that your internet has to work in order to get support. ;-)
[03:45] <Suspekt> can some one help me set up a RAID1 in ubuntu?
[03:45] <izm99> edgy has made my laptop retarded!  Ever since a failed resume (battery died while in "suspend") my laptop can't seem to find the swap.  what should i do?
[03:46] <calamari> Droit: hehe yep.. so only the one computer then?
[03:46] <Suspekt> can some one help me set up a RAID1 in edgy
[03:47] <Mantice> Can any one solve why mu azureus is gliching up it does not boot ?

[03:47] <river> I have booted from a live cd on a system which won't boot due to interrupted upgrade to edgy.

[03:48] <river> I have 2 cd drives one has the live cd and the other has the alternate. I see it on my livecd desktop but can't seem to find it on my chrooted terminal
[03:48] <Droit> calamari: Well, i think i'v found where i have to put the phone number, username and password, now i only have to find what they are. It's in a text file somewhere.
[03:49] <Droit> calamari: USR

[03:59] <igor> how there is a ubuntu website that explains how to run Windows programs in Ubuntu...using Wine...anybody knows...
[03:59] <Mantice> Xenguy: I saw a whole bunch of Beryl effects in Ubuntu and I thought that I could live with a couple of games in linux just for the eye candy.
[03:59] <kitche> dope: you would use scp
[03:59] <dope> what's that

[04:00] <kitche> dope it's ssh cp you would do scp user@host
[04:00] <dope> ah

[04:01] <asusathlon> anybody know of a way to burn .img dvd images on ubuntu?
[04:03] <kitche> asusathlon: I have never heard of .img dvd images before what I normally see is .iso or .img for a floppy
[04:03] <igor> how there is a ubuntu website that explains how to run Windows programs in Ubuntu...using Wine...anybody knows...
[04:03] <kitche> igor: do you mean where in the website?
[04:03] <LjL> !wine | igor

[04:04] <igor> thanks
[04:04] <asusathlon> my wine is screwed i cant locate where the drive_c is and it doesnt even correct with a removal reinstall of wine so i would like to try to find native app to burn these images or convert them to .iso
[04:05] <asusathlon> .img is roxio i think
[04:05] <kitche> asusathlon: drive_C for wine is usually ~/.drive_C
[04:05] <digi_> anyone know if there's a way to determine what compile flags were used for a particular package?
[04:05] <asusathlon> what would the full path be?

[04:08] <whatthedeuce> Hey.  Would anyone care to help me get dialup set up on my laptop.  I've opened up the Network settings program, and set up interface ppp0 with all of my information (phone number, username, password, etc).  I wasn't sure about what my modem port was, so I stuck with the default (/dev/modem).  Sadly, it's not working.  I've never set up dialup on Ubuntu before, so I may have missed an obvious step.  Could anyone help me out?
[04:08] <dope> i'm using putty to ssh in

[04:09] <dope> ok kewl thx
[04:09] <Xenguy> dope: both are good
[04:09] <kitche> dope: you don't directly connect to the machine though ssh you do it outside of a connection really
[04:09] <dope> i'll probably just put ubuntu on here anyway

[04:15] <whatthedeuce> kitche: I'm trying to get dialup working so I can install the things necessary to get wireless working.  It doesn't look like dialup will work without downloading anything, so I may as well just download the wireless things onto a USB and install them.  How would I put packages in apt onto a USB (would apt-get source work?)?
[04:16] <river> Pelo, Jordan_U, I'm want to 'apt-cdrom add' from a chroot session...so I can mount an edgy alternate without ejecting the livecd
[04:16] <zspada15> its quiet....
[04:16] <zspada15> perhaps too quiet
[04:16] <Vicente> too quiete....
[04:16] <kitche> whatthedeuce: what chipset is your wireless card?
[04:16] <Zarephath> Pelo: Well aint' that somethin' did a modprobe snd_powermac and lo and behold I have sound at least as far as the audio tests went..
[04:16] <noodles12> noob question: is it recommended to add sources using synaptic or just adding it to /etc/apt/sources.list? or does it matter?
[04:17] <Pelo> Zarephath,  congrats
[04:17] <Jordan_U> noodles12: Which ever you prefer, it doesn't matter.
[04:17] <Pelo> noodles12,  if you're a noob use synaptic
[04:17] <kitche> noodles12: doesn't matter really just depends on what you use really

[04:17] <pepoX> problem trying to install ati driver
[04:18] <kitche> pepoX: why not install the package?
[04:18] <Pelo> Zarephath,   unfortunately I didn'T have any problem installing any hardware,  so I can't help
[04:18] <tritium> pepoX: please use the ubuntu packages
[04:18] <pepoX> name?
[04:18] <tritium> !ati
[04:18] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:18] <pepoX> ok
[04:18] <PsiKloPx> hey all
[04:18] <zspada15> how come mine just worked?
[04:18] <whatthedeuce> kitche: Airplus DWL-650+.  I found this guide on getting it to work: http://stef.tvk.rwth-aachen.de/~nazgul/debian/DWL-650+_Howto.html
[04:18] <Zarephath> Did they do away with the developer channel? I don't see ubuntu+1 listed anymore..
=== Q[^_^] Q is now known as RodrigoX
[04:19] <kitche> Zarephath: it's secret right now
[04:19] <youser> is there a jack room on freenode?
[04:19] <Zarephath> Ahhh...
[04:19] <tritium> Zarephath: #ubuntu+1 is not the developer channel
[04:19] <river> Jordan_U, from my livecd terminal I get cdrom cdrw ptycd ttycd but from my chroot session I get tons of them
[04:19] <jstew> jack rules.
[04:19] <tritium> And #ubuntu+1 hasn't been reopened yet
[04:19] <jstew> just had to say that :)
[04:19] <kitche> Zarephath: anyways #ubuntu+1 is for the development version of ubuntu
[04:20] <Zarephath> tritium: Ummm it was the place to go to ask edgy questions prior to its official release...however I stand corrected...
[04:20] <dope> does ubuntu come witl a c++ compiler?
[04:20] <zspada15> no
[04:20] <dope> WHAT?!
[04:20] <mzli> dope:gcc
[04:20] <kitche> whatthedeuce: and this card doesn't work in ubuntu by default?
[04:20] <zspada15> dope: sudo apt-get gcc
[04:20] <dope> ok thx
[04:20] <tritium> dope: you install build-essential
[04:20] <mzli> dope:but you need apt it.
[04:20] <whatthedeuce> It doesn't get detected during the install
[04:20] <tritium> not just gcc
[04:20] <Jordan_U> dope: no, sudo apt-get install build essentials
[04:20] <Zarephath> kitche: After I modprobe a module will Ubuntu keep it and reload the next time a reboot occurs?
[04:20] <zspada15> build-essential
[04:20] <dope> ok thx
[04:20] <tritium> Zarephath: #ubuntu+1 is for each development release, not just edgy
[04:20] <gnomefreak> dope: install build-essential (its on the cd/dvd if you dont want to install it from net.
[04:21] <mzli> tritium:I know lots compiler. gtk ..etc
[04:21] <gnomefreak> #ubuntu+1 will be open aftter the UDS
[04:21] <tritium> mzli: build-essential doesn't install gtk
[04:21] <gnomefreak> should be
[04:21] <jstew> jack is a modular sound system that can run in realtime and allows mixing of lots of channels, among other neat stuff. It's mainly for sound studio type apps
[04:21] <dope> ok it's going
[04:21] <dope> what does this install?
[04:21] <kitche> Zarephath: no unless you add it to the /etc/modules.d forgot the name of the file that the module has to be added to though
[04:21] <zspada15> !jack

[04:22] <kitche> mzli: anyways gtk isn't a compiler
[04:22] <tritium> dope: apt-cache depends build-essential will tell you
[04:22] <Zarephath> kitche: Thanks

[04:23] <Aven> Pelo: what? :(
[04:23] <kitche> whatthedeuce: hmm there is a way to get packages on a usb you have to download them then go to the /var/cache/packages directory and get the packages that you need there
[04:23] <campbch> hello.
[04:23] <Aven> Pelo: you're attractive
[04:23] <Aven> what program can I use to record microphone?
[04:23] <campbch> i'm trying to get CoD to run, on a graphics card that can handle it, and after 3 days of trying to get it to install i have done so, and found a wine version that can handle it
[04:23] <Aven> what program can I use to record my voice on the microphone?
[04:24] <Aven> I wanna hear myself sing
[04:24] <whatthedeuce> kitche: Would there be a better way to do this that I'm not thinking of?
[04:24] <Pelo> Aven,  look up recorder or recording in synaptic
[04:24] <Aven> mkay, thats pela
[04:24] <Aven> lol
[04:24] <Pelo> ...
[04:24] <campbch> but now the game itself is telling me my graphics card (intel 915 family) is lacking in minimum features
[04:24] <Aven> pela in spanish is a bad word
[04:24] <campbch> i need to install intel's drivers
[04:24] <Aven> AHAHAHAHA

[04:25] <campbch> how can i fix this?
[04:25] <kitche> Aven: you want a really good program there is audacity
[04:25] <youser> jack audio production
[04:25] <river> Jorden_U,  the 'ls /dev | grep cd' on my chrooted session produces a long list, how do I know which are mounted and as what ?
[04:25] <youser> im trying to mak beats on reason
[04:26] <zspada15> audacity is awsome
[04:26] <youser> i just unloaded my gigs of amples
[04:26] <youser> no, audacity isnt awesome
[04:26] <MiD> hi ppl
[04:26] <youser> its good for sequencing already made tracks
[04:26] <MiD> how can i get all universe/multiverse packages onto a dvd for upgrading a machine without a connection?
[04:26] <kitche> whatthedeuce: the way that I todl to get he packages is the best way I do not know much about that chipset myself
[04:27] <campbch> for the love of god!
[04:27] <techNiKal> hi i heard it is possible to open and close ports directly from a file ?
[04:27] <techNiKal> is it possible in ubuntu linux
[04:27] <campbch> in a non-religious exasperated sense, of course
[04:27] <jStefan> !firewall | techNiKal
[04:27] <ubotu> techNiKal: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:28] <M0E-lnx> hey, how do you start services like sshd, samba, etc in ubuntu?
[04:28] <zspada15> !hosts
[04:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hosts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[04:28] <tritium> M0E-lnx: they start on boot
[04:28] <techNiKal> jStefan no i am talking about ports opening through file
[04:28] <tritium> (or after being installed)
[04:28] <M0E-lnx> so you can't mannually stop one?
[04:28] <youser> is there a way i can sort my xchat room list?
[04:28] <jStefan> techNiKal, iptables saves to a file, read the wiki it might say something on it
[04:28] <tritium> M0E-lnx: sure you can.  sudo invoke-rc.d <service name> start | stop | restart
[04:29] <kitche> techNiKal: umm do you mean the internet super daemon since that's what popped in my mind when you said it?
[04:29] <jStefan> M0E-lnx, start stop sripts are located in /etc/init.d/    you just run them and the first parameter could be: start stop restart etc
[04:29] <campbch> is there anyone available who can help me build intel 915 graphics chipset drivers?
[04:29] <campbch> i do not understand them
[04:29] <Pelo> youser,  there is an option in the prefs to order the channels by alphabetical order or by opening order
[04:29] <whatthedeuce> kitche: If there are dependencies for the package that I don't know about, will it tell me?
[04:30] <campbch> but need to compile them and use them
[04:30] <tritium> campbch: they're already included by default for you
[04:30] <newtoubuntu> Can I get some help?
[04:30] <MiD> no one can help me? how can i get all universe/multiverse packages onto a dvd for upgrading a machine without a connection?
[04:30] <campbch> the game says they arent good
[04:30] <campbch> they need to be upgraded
[04:30] <M0E-lnx> mmm. jStefan, so sudo /etc/init.d/sshd stop will stop the sshd server?
[04:30] <newtoubuntu> Ubuntu locks up before it ever starts.
[04:30] <campbch> so i need to use the newest version from the intel site
[04:30] <lun_> who has HandelGotD font maybe can send ir for over dcc?
[04:30] <Pelo> campbch,  I think intel cards just work off the default drivers
[04:30] <techNiKal> kitche i heard that a file is available in linux by which you can mention the name and the number of port such as ssh/22 you can change it to some other as well
[04:30] <lun_> *it
[04:30] <newtoubuntu> It hangs on the splash screen
[04:30] <campbch> no
[04:30] <jStefan> M0E-lnx, yes, or what tritium said
[04:30] <kitche> whatthedeuce: well it should if you are downloading them using apt-get but it also says the dependencies on the website
[04:30] <campbch> i need it for a GAME (and screensavers dont work) that is telling me it is NOTworking
[04:31] <kitche> techNiKal: think you are looking for inetd.conf but not sure
[04:31] <campbch> i need the intel drivers from the website, the official linux drivers, something that MIGHT help
[04:31] <campbch> forgive me for being rash, but i am on day 3 of trying to get this game working
[04:31] <campbch> and now im stuck
[04:31] <campbch> trying to compile drivers from source
[04:31] <ervin> alguien que hable espaol...........necesito ayuda
[04:31] <campbch> !es

[04:34] <campbch> i dont even understand
[04:34] <Kervan> hey can anybody help me about slow dns request?
[04:34] <kitche> !flash9

[04:34] <zspada15> Pelo: you want to typically run ./configure && make && sudo make install
[04:34] <zspada15> newtoubuntu: no
[04:34] <lun_> who has HandelGotD font maybe can send ir for me over dcc?
[04:34] <kitche> newtoubuntu: you didn't say anything you just said hello
[04:34] <Pelo> zspada15,   I'm not the one with the problem
[04:34] <newtoubuntu> Can someone give me some direction?
[04:34] <campbch> it says Make World

[04:34] <newtoubuntu> ubuntu freezes at the splash screen
[04:34] <zspada15> !make
[04:34] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[04:34] <campbch> NO
[04:34] <newtoubuntu> It never runs. even in safe mode...
[04:34] <campbch> i already read that it doesnt apply
[04:35] <pcgigabyte> Could someone help me. I got gyache working in ubuntu with voice. But I the voice is all jarble any suggestions?
[04:35] <alc> newtoubuntu, smp?
[04:35] <jstew> Anyone else having trouble with nvidia and xv tearing in edgy? I figured out how to fix it.
[04:35] <Pelo> campbch,  what do the last the or four lines of the compilation tell you
[04:35] <the_tich> Pelo, you mean just unpack the compressed folder and drop the files somewhere? where would i drop them?
[04:35] <newtoubuntu> I've tried everything I know but I'm stuck
[04:35] <campbch> this source is different, there is no configure, there is nothing, autoconf does nothing im just supposed to do stuff
[04:35] <magickal1> jstew Im all ears
[04:35] <newtoubuntu> It just freezes about 10 seconds after selecting run or install from the CD boot menu
[04:35] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, did the CD burn ok?
[04:35] <zspada15> campbch: what are you trying to do?
[04:35] <Pelo> the_tich,  there is just one file to copy replace,  just search for it on your hdd and copy over the locations you find
[04:35] <newtoubuntu> The screen is a Graphical screen that says UBUNTU on it...
[04:36] <newtoubuntu> Yes it burned fine...
[04:36] <newtoubuntu> I even checked the hash
[04:36] <zspada15> newtoubuntu: let it load for 10 minutes and then if it doesnt load come back
[04:36] <newtoubuntu> I even ran the check cd from the boot menu
[04:36] <kitche> campbch: it doesn't have a ./configure but does it have a MakeFile.am or something close that that?
[04:36] <newtoubuntu> I've been letting it sit there for over an hour.
[04:36] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, platform?
[04:36] <Pelo> the_tich,  the package I got  just had to files in it , a lib* and a txt file for install instructions
[04:36] <newtoubuntu> The caps lock is frozen

[04:36] <newtoubuntu> I have an Intel 3.2Ghz Cpu...
[04:37] <campbch> it has makefile, xmakefile
[04:37] <pepoX> for 3d i need Driver          "ati" of Driver "fglrx" ?
[04:37] <jstew> magickal1: sudo nvidia-config --no-composite (assuming youre not using the composite ext) composite is enabled by default and has tearign problems.
[04:37] <newtoubuntu> It's an Abit IS7 Motherboard
[04:37] <Pelo> campbch,   look up  gl.h in synaptic and if you find it , install it
[04:37] <kitche> campbch: your missing Mesa-dev files
[04:37] <newtoubuntu> 1 GB DDR 400 Ram Dual Channel Mode
[04:37] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, is it the desktop CD or alternate CD ?
[04:37] <newtoubuntu> 300GB SATA Hard Drive

[04:37] <Volodya_> Volodya
[04:37] <newtoubuntu> another 300GB IDE
[04:38] <newtoubuntu> an 800GB RAID 0
[04:38] <the_tich> Pelo, oh so i can just follow the install instructions then... i don't have flash 7 (it is a fresh install) that shouldn't be a problem right?
[04:38] <tritium> as opposed to "my" missing Mesa-dev files
[04:38] <newtoubuntu> An ATI All in wonder 9800 pro
[04:38] <jstew> also when I disabled composite it had the side effect of brining the system load from 3.7 back down to .9 when watching TV with myth
[04:38] <zspada15> newtoubuntu: thats confusing
=== La is now known as Garota
[04:38] <Volodya_> send me ubuntu christian edition
[04:38] <newtoubuntu> That's just what's in my sytstem
[04:38] <Pelo> the_tich,   you got me there, I would install flash 7 first
[04:38] <the_tich> Pelo, okay thanks.
[04:38] <splintax> hrm
[04:38] <jstew> google jesux Volodya_
[04:38] <tritium> Volodya_: that's an independent project
[04:38] <kitche> the_tich: why not just install the package that Sveas made?
[04:39] <newtoubuntu> Is there a step by step boot process so I can see where it locks up?
[04:39] <splintax> you know how you can use vmware to run windows within linux
[04:39] <splintax> is there any way i could run a copy of windows from a local hard disk, within windows?
[04:39] <the_tich> kitche, what file is this, where do i get it, and what are its benifits?
[04:39] <kitche> splintax: yes and yes

[04:39] <river> Jordan_U, ok finally mounted /dev/hdd on /media/cdrom1 I now ant to add this via apt_cdrom add so that I can continue my interupted upgrade without ejecting the livecd from which I booted
[04:40] <splintax> kitche: how would i go about it? vmware?
[04:40] <newtoubuntu> Is there a way to step through the boot process to see where it freezes up?
[04:40] <jstew> thats interesting, I never knew there was a christian edition of ubuntu
[04:40] <kitche> splintax: yes need vmware
[04:40] <the_tich> kitche, thanks.
[04:40] <tritium> newtoubuntu: yes, boot into single-user mode, and step through the init scripts
[04:40] <splintax> kitche: at the moment i'm dual booting - what i want to do is jump into my windows install without having to reboot
[04:40] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, you could disable splash and quiet
[04:41] <campbch> !X11r6
[04:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about X11r6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:41] <kitche> jstew: it's not from ubuntu though
[04:41] <tritium> newtoubuntu: they're all numbered
[04:41] <splintax> kitche: ok, thanks. i'll look into it.
[04:41] <newtoubuntu> I just want to diagnose the lockup at boot...
[04:41] <jstew> yeah, I figured, but the webpage even stole the ubuntu look and feel lol
[04:41] <newtoubuntu> I need to step through the boot process
[04:41] <river> Jordan_U, never mind I think I've got it used 'sudo apt-cdrom -d /media/cdrom1 add'
[04:41] <newtoubuntu> Is there a way?
[04:41] <Pelo> are you the splintax from utorrent ?
[04:41] <tritium> newtoubuntu: see my comments to you above
[04:42] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, edit the boot command (the menu will have an option for that) replace "quiet splash" for "single"
[04:42] <newtoubuntu> You sais they are all numbered
[04:42] <newtoubuntu> What does that mean?
[04:42] <newtoubuntu> Trying that....
[04:42] <kamui> I've tried two edgy upgrades, each progressively more successfull than the last
[04:43] <kamui> but even in my last upgrade my system became very unstable and I had a sparatic touchpad
[04:43] <jStefan> kamui, that's good
[04:43] <campbch> ok, it didnt work again, with the mesa-dev package, and is returning the same error
[04:43] <jStefan> kamui, i spoke too soon

[04:44] <kamui> jStefan: well, I wonder if I should just stop fuxkin with whats not broken (dapper is perfectly running on this laptop), or should I just download the Edgy live cd and try a fresh install from there
[04:44] <specialbuddy> what kind of laptop would be good for linux
[04:44] <newtoubuntu> I'm getting IDE: failed opcode unknown
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> specialbuddy: got a Dell Latitude D820, it works very well
[04:44] <zspada15> newtoubuntu: sounds to me like ur Raid is b0rked
[04:45] <jStefan> kamui, i'm a bit lost, what exactly is failing? an upgraded system or the CD ?
[04:45] <specialbuddy> cool
[04:45] <kamui> jStefan: the upgrade from dapper
[04:45] <newtoubuntu> RAID works fine....
[04:45] <newtoubuntu> In XP that is...
[04:45] <jStefan> kamui, ignore that last one, i'm not lost anymore
[04:45] <kamui> jStefan: Im doing a dist-upgrade each time
[04:45] <zspada15> well, your going to have problems
[04:45] <sigger> just added a bunch of passwd's.  I notice that in shadow they're stored in cleartext.  that's not right is it?
[04:45] <newtoubuntu> It does come up flagges as dirty all the time though....
[04:45] <jStefan> kamui, that's what i get for supporting 2 people at the same time :(
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> specialbuddy: it was free from work, I'd buy it if I had to, like it tons, nvidia vid works good, does beryl/xgl, also Intel wireless works well
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> dvd burner works
[04:46] <newtoubuntu> chkdsk does not find anything wrong with the RAID
[04:46] <jStefan> kamui, updata-manager is preferred over dist-upgrade
[04:46] <jStefan> update-manager*
[04:47] <harry> Can a winmodem be used to fax as well?
[04:47] <river> How do I get 'apt-get dist-upgrade' to use the cd in /media/cdrom1 when it asks for a media change ? it keeps asking for '/cdrom/' instead
[04:47] <kitche> harry: depends some modems don't have that feature
[04:47] <kitche> river check your /etc/source.lst to make sure it's pointing at /media/cdrom1
[04:47] <Pelo> harry,  you also need to give yourself permission to fax,  in user under admin
[04:47] <jStefan> river check your sources.list and see what it sayd (then do sudo apt-get update)
[04:48] <kamui> jStefan: a lot of people have stated that edgy has a ton of great new features and software and compatibility, and it seems to work well for them.  For one, my network card bcm43xx works with the native driver in edgy, but in dapper I haev to use ndiswrapper.  Another thing is that kubuntu supports all of my keyboard special keys on this laptop (not that I use kde, but it was nice to know that it worked.  Edgy still won't suspend, but dapper d
[04:48] <kamui> oes hibernate.   So its a tossup, I think I can make dapper do everything that edgy does, but manually, and It will take a lot of research.
[04:48] <jStefan> says*
[04:48] <harry> What version of the kernel has the ltmodem drivers built in or do I need to add the modules?
[04:49] <river> kitchie, jStefan, I did ' sudo apt-cdrom -d /media/cdrom1 add' is that not enough ?
[04:49] <cari_sohib_ce> 
[04:49] <tritium> kamui: to clarify, edgy _does_ suspend, but evidently not on your hardware
[04:49] <jstew> Dapper is more stable and seems to be less "rushed", at least in my experiences
[04:50] <Volodya> hey send me ubuntu christian editions
[04:50] <Pelo> harry did you try installing a fax app from synaptic,  I would the think the proper dependencies would get added to
[04:50] <jstew> But now that I have edgy working almost the way I want, it's all good.
[04:50] <kitche> jstew: Edgy is meant as the name says from what I have read
[04:50] <kamui> tritium: thats more or less what I meant, I can't get suspend to work on either dapper or edgy with my hardware, it just doesn't come back.  But I can hibernate in dapper, but edgy doesn't hibernate for me,  I reboot back into the os from scratch
[04:50] <cari_sohib_ce>  /
[04:50] <Pelo> Volodya,  what's special about the christian edition ?
[04:50] <tritium> Volodya: I told you, that's an independent project.  We can't send it to you.
[04:50] <tritium> Please stop asking
[04:50] <h3htimo> how can i get the gdesklets config gui to appear when i accidentaly removed the icon from the system tray??
[04:50] <jstew> lol. seems to be a bad pun kitche buy it's true imho
[04:50] <jstew> s/buy/but/
[04:50] <newtoubuntu> can I get ubuntu to ignore the RAID?
[04:50] <cari_sohib_ce> n
[04:51] <harry> Do I need to add the drivers to the winmodem first before installing the fax app?
[04:51] <cari_sohib_ce>       13       cdv
[04:51] <tritium> kamui: do you have a sufficiently sized swap partition?
[04:51] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, try temporarily removing un-needed drives, and see if it works
[04:51] <zspada15> somebody please ban cari_sohib_ce
[04:52] <newtoubuntu> Like Disonnnect them>
[04:52] <zspada15> yes nemish
[04:52] <jStefan> newtoubuntu, yeah, that should at least help you isolate the problem
[04:52] <tritium> zspada15: for what?
[04:52] <zspada15> s/nemish/newtoubuntu
[04:52] <zspada15> hes trolling
[04:52] <zspada15> or at least kick him
[04:52] <jStefan> zspada15, why so harsh?
[04:52] <jstew> trolling, looks more like a malfunctioning bot to me
[04:53] <tritium> aye
[04:53] <newtoubuntu> I may just fubar this install and put it on another PC. I just wanted to dualk boot to it....
[04:53] <newtoubuntu> It would have been cool...
[04:53] <newtoubuntu> But Linux still does not hev the hardware support that Windows does...
[04:53] <knapp> I am having a problem with Konversation, the Server List pops up when I open it, has no buttons, and will not close.
[04:53] <zspada15> newtoubuntu: take that back
[04:54] <zspada15> it has a fuck of a lot more
[04:54] <jStefan> !language | zspada15
[04:54] <ubotu> zspada15: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[04:54] <zspada15> sorry, strong feeling
[04:54] <jstew> newtoubuntu: I find it to be the opposite.. Ive had better luck with linux installs than windows
[04:54] <cari_sohib_ce> 
=== RodrigoX is now known as RodrigoX`durmind
[04:54] <tritium> zspada15: none of that please
=== RodrigoX`durmind is now known as RodrigoX`afk
[04:54] <zspada15> sorry
[04:54] <tritium> Or it'll be /mode +q for you
[04:55] <kamui> tritium: 2 gig swap
[04:55] <zspada15> ok im sorry wont happen again
[04:55] <jStefan> mute would be more fair
[04:55] <tritium> thanks
[04:55] <tritium> jStefan: that's +q
[04:55] <jStefan> ...but i meant it for the malfunctioning bot, not zspada15
[04:55] <kamui> tritium: 1.250 gigs of real mem
[04:55] <wastrel> "Ubunto"
[04:55] <tritium> kamui: okay, good
[04:57] <kamui> tritium: is there a log or other way to trace what hardware or drivers may be causing the suspend to crash?  That way I think I could write a script to attempt to diable the drivers (modprobe -r them) before the suspend
[04:57] <zspada15> kamui: put cat modprobe < log.text into your shutdown scripts?
[04:57] <tritium> kamui: if you have an idea of which they are, modprobe -r them prior to suspending
[04:58] <tritium> kamui: if that works, there are settings in /etc/default/acpi-support that you can edit to modprobe -r modules before suspending
[04:58] <XiCillin> how can i make nessusd start at startup?
[04:59] <B_166-ER-X> question here... and so help please : I just installed  a new nvidia Geforce card on my pc, and  I am desperately searching to find how to 'tell' ubuntu that there is a New (much newer) nvidia Card... I have 'reinstalled' the nvidia-glx drivers, but in the xorg.conf under 'device' its still the name of my old card ..
[04:59] <kamui> tritium: the problem is that i have NO idea what might be causing it.  Im pretty sure its not the graphics driver or the wifi, the crash happens when X is runnnig without acceleration using the standard ATI driver and with ndiswrapper blacklisted
[04:59] <B_166-ER-X> and so.. : and some, sorry
[04:59] <Pelo> XiCillin,  system > prets > session
[04:59] <kamui> tritium: I just don't know how to track down where the resume halts
[04:59] <Volodya> http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/christianubuntu/2006/07/about-ubuntu-christian-edition.html            http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/linuxforchristians/blog.html
[04:59] <Jordan_U> B_166-ER-X: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh
[05:00] <Jordan_U> B_166-ER-X: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[05:00] <B_166-ER-X> okay
[05:00] <XiCillin> Pelo, yea but nessusd needs to be started as root
[05:00] <zspada15> what is phigh?
[05:00] <kamui> tritium: Im not even sure how far back up the system gets, I don't have access to a second computer that I can attempt to ssh into the blank laptop with ATM.
[05:00] <Jordan_U> zspada15: Only ask questions of high priority.
[05:00] <tritium> Volodya: please don't advertise here
[05:01] <kamui> tritium: could I try modprobe -r ing EVERYTHING and then putting it all back at resume?  I don't know how unstable that would make the system if most all of the hardware modules were removed...
[05:01] <wastrel> the device name in xorg.conf is just a label.
[05:01] <wastrel> afaik
[05:01] <dragonfly7> Is there a command to restart alsa?
[05:01] <tritium> kamui: doesn't sound like a reasonable approach.  What makes you think it's a kernel module?
[05:02] <Volodya> advertise-what is it??  i am russian...
[05:02] <harry> Hey everyone, thanks for all the advise.
[05:02] <river> jStefan, ok my source.list says "deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025.1)] / edgy main restricted" can I just change that to "cdrom1:.." since I want to use /media/cdrom1 ?
[05:02] <mzli> Volodya: a method to make other know your product.
[05:02] <mzli> Volodya:or your service.
[05:03] <B_166-ER-X> Jordan_U,  now under device its 'Generic video card'    :/
[05:03] <jStefan> river, you could remove that line, run sudo apt-get update, and then run apt-cdrom
[05:03] <Volodya> send me ubuntu CE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[05:03] <B_166-ER-X> Generic is a dull name for a 7300Gs ..
[05:03] <tritium> Volodya: enough!
[05:03] <Flannel> Volodya: UbuntuCE is not an official ubuntu distribution, please ask about it in #ubuntu-offtopic, or other more appropriate places
[05:03] <Jordan_U> B_166-ER-X: Somebody said earlier that the device name is just a label, if everything works, it works :)
[05:04] <B_166-ER-X> hm
[05:04] <theBeno> I need to "make install", what package do I need to install to do that?
[05:04] <wastrel> feel free to go in and change it, just make sure you change it in both places.  (backup the working copy first )
[05:04] <Flannel> theBeno: build-essential will get you a compiler, are you sure you need to compile something though?
[05:05] <theBeno> Flannel, yes.
[05:05] <Pelo> theBeno,   you need to have build-essential package install
[05:05] <Volodya> oooooohhh :-(
[05:05] <theBeno> Flannel, I just could remember the name of the package. :P
[05:05] <river> jStefan, this is an upgrade that was interupted by a machine restart I am trying to recover while booted from a livecd...and would removing it get it to use the alternate edgy cd I have in /media/cdrom1 ?
[05:05] <theBeno> Thanks guys!
[05:05] <jstew> stop trolling Volodya, that's the 5th time you've asked
[05:06] <cevia1> anybody know of boot options I can try to get a really old laptop to boot
[05:06] <jStefan> river, apt-cdrom should add the CD correctly
[05:06] <Pelo> Volodya,   look it up on google
[05:06] <mzli> jstew:what's his problem?
[05:06] <cevia1> it freezes when I try to boot it
[05:06] <jStefan> river, if all else fails, try a symlink
[05:06] <cevia1> err install it
[05:06] <Jordan_U> B_166-ER-X: Since you have run that command though, you may want to restart x and make sure everything works ( if not there is a backup of your old xorg.conf )
[05:07] <zcat[1] > cevia1: how old? It might not be grunty enough to boot (<128M is the usual problem)
[05:07] <theBeno> Pelo, there is a whole bunch of build-essential packages, which one?
[05:07] <jstew> mzli: I dont know if he does not understand internet customs, but he insists on someone sending him an unofficial ubuntu based distro.
[05:07] <DEDHED> Hollo
[05:07] <DEDHED> I upgrade My Winderz Xp to Ubuntu Xp?
[05:07] <Pelo> theBeno,   the one that says just build-essentials,  in synaptic
[05:07] <Volodya> ok. good day for you!
[05:07] <cevia1> its like 7 yrs
[05:08] <zcat[1] > DEDHED: nah, we're all runing ubuntu vista already
[05:08] <cevia1> it boots win95
[05:08] <river> that's what I thought, and I added it usind the 'apt-cdrom -d /media/cdrom1 add' however, when I do 'apt-get dist-upgrade' it ask me for a media change looking at /media/cdrom instead which has my livecd I booted from
[05:08] <theBeno> Pelo, ahh, Found it.  There is no s on essentials.  It's just build-essential.  That's what threw me off, thanks.
[05:08] <zcat[1] > my pocket calculator boots win95 :)
[05:08] <cevia1> lol
[05:08] <jstew> lol
[05:08] <mzli> jstew: oh, maybe language problem.
[05:08] <cevia1> i gotta check the ram I guess
[05:08] <river> jStefan, soory missed to include your handle above
[05:08] <cevia1> the amount
[05:09] <zcat[1] > otherwise perhaps look at xubuntu, or if it's really low-spec try something like feather linux...
[05:09] <jStefan> river, maybe it requires removal of what existed before
[05:10] <river> jStefan, ok removing the deb cdrom: line
[05:10] <Jordan_U> river: There is an upgrade script on the cd also, you may try that.
[05:11] <Kervan> hello. when i do "sudo ifconfig eth0 down" and then "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" i can not resolve internet can any body help pls...

[05:18] <DEDHED> yes it is too agony for me now =(
[05:19] <theBeno> I install build-essentials and I still can't seem to get ophcrack to compile.
[05:19] <Flannel> theBeno: what error does it give you
[05:19] <jStefan> theBeno, try apt-get builddep
[05:19] <Pelo> theBeno,   do you have all the dependencies installed ?
[05:20] <theBeno> There was a problem with GTK
[05:21] <Pelo> theBeno,  when you type  ./configure , what are the last couple of lines you get ?
[05:22] <Pelo> theBeno,  actualy, you might find this usefull   http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[05:22] <Jordan_U> If I decide I am really lazy, is there a way to install the -dev packages corrosponding to all of the libraries I have installed?
[05:22] <theBeno> Pelo, ***couldn't run GTK+ test program...
[05:22] <Pelo> theBeno,  ok , that's a new one to me
[05:22] <wastrel> Jordan_U:  not that i'm aware of but you can apt-get build-dep for whatever you're wanting to compile
[05:23] <radioaktivstorm> i updated ubuntu recently, but for some reason my swap didnt come with it. what do i do?
[05:23] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, how much ram do you have?
[05:23] <Kervan> can any body help me pls i need sleep :(
[05:23] <radioaktivstorm> 256MB
[05:23] <Jordan_U>  wastrel: I know, but not all programs are known by apt-get build-dep,it isn't important though.
[05:24] <Pelo> Kervan,  get sleep now come back fresh tomorrow
[05:24] <DEDHED> EAT CAFFEINE
[05:24] <Kervan> thanks good idea but i cant sleep with a problem
[05:24] <wastrel> Kervan:  ifconfig doesn't call your dhcp client
[05:24] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, I have 256MB RAM
[05:24] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, you could see if you have any unpartitioned space left and create it there, otherwise you could resize a partition
[05:24] <wastrel> try ifup  instead Kervan
[05:25] <radioaktivstorm> ok, but shouldnt i already have a partition for swap?
[05:26] <Jordan_U> Kervan: sudo ifup eth0
[05:26] <santeria[FL] > i have a problem... i tried installing ubuntu 6.10 on my computer and when it started loading it shows random colored lines on teh screen, while the same cd, on my dads computer which is older than mine, it works perfectly. could it be because i have a 64bit processor compared to his 32 bit?
[05:26] <zcat[1] > santeria[FL] : probably different video chipset
[05:26] <theBeno> Pelo, do you know anything about rainbow tables?
[05:26] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Is it an ATI card?
[05:26] <santeria[FL] > hmm
[05:26] <Pelo> theBeno,  no I am sorry
[05:26] <santeria[FL] > nah i got an nvidia 6800gs
[05:27] <santeria[FL] > he is on an integrated graphics card from his celeron
[05:27] <theBeno> Pelo, one other question... When I run ./configure, does it change any files outside of the folder that I extracted?
[05:27] <dredhammer> whats the name of the program to have your program windows go into tray icons when minimized?
[05:27] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Are they diagonal lines? ( I had a similar problem )
[05:27] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, I upgraded to the latest release of ubuntu  recently so there was already a swap partition,,, but i dont know what to do to get it back
[05:27] <santeria[FL] > what was wierd is on the kubuntu installer when i tried that it didnt have the lines, but it went into some command prompt that had some stuff that i didnt understand
[05:28] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, you can check with "free"
[05:28] <santeria[FL] > oh theyre horizontal lines
[05:28] <Pelo> theBeno, , ./configure only check to make sure you have all the dependencies to run the app,    make  creates the proper installation file and  make install  does the actual installation
[05:29] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : And when you mive the mouse up or down there is a thin black line moving left and right?
[05:29] <techNiKal> hi i want to use azureus and it is saying open your 6889 udp port ?
[05:29] <techNiKal> how do i do that ?
[05:29] <santeria[FL] > i didnt try to move the mouse up and down
[05:29] <theBeno> Pelo, ahhh, thanks. I kindof wondered what those always did. :P
[05:29] <santeria[FL] > should i try that?
[05:29] <Kingsqueak> techNiKal: are you running a firewall?
[05:29] <Pelo> techNiKal,  do you have a router ?   open it in the router
[05:29] <techNiKal> no it is disabled on the router
[05:30] <techNiKal> Pelo it is disabled on the router
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> techNiKal: then you are all set if the firewall forwards that port to your client machine
[05:30] <santeria[FL] > should i try to hook my monitor into my integrated vga port instead of my graphics card port?
[05:30] <Pelo> techNiKal,  then you need to open it
[05:30] <tgelter> hey guys, where do I modify my PATH?
[05:30] <techNiKal> Pelo how to open it ?
[05:30] <jStefan> techNiKal, ubuntu does not block any ports by default (but i can)
[05:30] <Pelo> techNiKal,   and in the firewall if you have one , but I can'T help you with that
[05:30] <techNiKal> Pelo and where to open it ?
[05:30] <Pelo> tech  www.portforward.com
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> tgelter: in .bashrc if you use bash     export PATH=$PATH:/something/new/here
[05:30] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, swap is 0 but if  i look through the device manager...i get that i have 4 partitions: ext3, ntfs and two unlabeled ones (im dual booted with XP)
[05:31] <techNiKal> Pelo what is portforward.com ?
[05:31] <Pelo> techNiKal,   the linux equivalent of ipconfig is if config
[05:31] <tgelter> Kingsqueak: I thought I looked through the .bashrc and didn't find anything, but I'll look again
[05:31] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : If you are having the same problem as me you should be able to fix it by installing the nvidea drivers or using vesa.
[05:31] <Pelo> techNiKal,  that's a site that gives you info on how to open a port in your specific router
[05:31] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, don't know what happened there
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> tgelter: may be .bash_profile
[05:31] <techNiKal> Pelo thanks i will try now
[05:32] <santeria[FL] > if i retry the kubuntu installer what should i do when it goes to that wierd command prompt thing?
[05:32] <wastrel> .bash_profile is for login session  .bashrc is non-login
[05:32] <Wiseguy> hey guys, is there a lot of known issues with updating 6.06 to 6.10 through the internet updates?
[05:32] <Pelo> techNiKal,  if you need more help with that go and ask on #azureus-support
[05:32] <Flannel> santeria[FL] : what command prompt thing?
[05:32] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and choose vesa
[05:32] <river> jStefan, ok, I removed the cdrom: line in sources.list, then did apt-get update, then 'apt-cdrom --cdrom /media/cdrom1 add' , this indeed added the liine back into source.list
[05:33] <santeria[FL] > so type that when
[05:33] <santeria[FL] > i guess ill write that down cause i wont remember it lol
[05:33] <Flannel> Wiseguy: believe Xubuntu has an issue with upgrading via update-manager, you'd have to check launchpad for others though
[05:33] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : But first, did you try booting in safe graphics mode?
[05:33] <jStefan> river, exactly the same line? or a fixed one ?
[05:33] <santeria[FL] > no i didnt try that i will though
[05:33] <tgelter> PATH=~/bin:/usr/local/lib:"${PATH}"  ... does that work?
[05:33] <jStefan> river, more importantly, is it working?
[05:33] <Pelo> g'night folks
[05:33] <wastrel> my bad, both .bashrc and .bash_profile are for login shells
[05:34] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, hmm...i dont know. Is there a way for me to gain access to the other partitions on my HDD through ubuntu? or do i need to run a live cd or something to tweak?
[05:34] <santeria[FL] > once i do that if i get into ubuntu can i install my nvidia drivers to ubuntu?
[05:34] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Yes.
[05:34] <santeria[FL] > does nvidia have linux drivers?
[05:34] <river> jStefan, exactly the same, so how does it know which drive to use.
[05:34] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Yes, verry good ones in fact :)
[05:34] <jstew> santeria: yes
[05:34] <theBeno> Pelo, thanks for the help/
[05:34] <santeria[FL] > schweet
[05:34] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, ubuntu needs to mount swap partitions maybe the entry is missing from fstab ?
[05:34] <Jordan_U> !nvidia | santeria[FL] 
[05:34] <ubotu> santeria[FL] : To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:35] <tgelter> ahh...got it...The global $PATH is defined in /etc/profile
[05:35] <jStefan> river, dont know :(
[05:35] <faddatp> Does anyone know how to make glx work with the G965 chipset?
[05:35] <rBlong2us> hi all
[05:35] <rBlong2us> I do this and isn't working sudo dpkg-reconfigure xsever-xorg
[05:35] <rBlong2us> what the heck
[05:36] <river> jStefan, now tried 'apt-get dist-upgrade' and it want me to put the edgy cd into '/cdrom' then press enter
[05:36] <rBlong2us> sorryI forgot the r
[05:36] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: In what way is it not working?
[05:36] <jStefan> river, try symbolic links
[05:36] <river> jStefan, how ? sorry I'm already at the edges of my noobness
[05:37] <rBlong2us> Jordan_U: I just forgot to put r on server now it's fine
[05:37] <santeria[FL] > one more thing before i try this: how easy is irc to get for ubuntu ;)
[05:37] <garrett__> does anyone know how to explain how to install wolfenstien ET onto ubuntu to a noob?
[05:37] <rBlong2us> howeverr which one is better vesa, fbdev or vga?
[05:37] <jStefan> river, man ln, you are looking for -s option
[05:37] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: What card do you have?
[05:37] <rBlong2us> sis X driver jerks the LCD screen like hell
[05:38] <rBlong2us> I hate this shit
[05:38] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, how would i figure out whether the entry exists or not??
[05:38] <rBlong2us> Jordan_U: a BS SIS
[05:38] <rBlong2us> sis agp pro and jercks the screen maddly, I've been already a week trying to figure this shit out
[05:39] <the_tich> Jordan_U, is downloading from the seveas site usually slow?
[05:39] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: I remember you now :)
[05:39] <rBlong2us> I've tried a thousand refreshes and so on'
[05:39] <garrett__> does anyone know how to explain how to install wolfenstien ET onto ubuntu to a noob?
[05:39] <rBlong2us> is fdev better than vesa?
[05:39] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, you will need to check if one of those partitions is in fact a swap, i dont know how to to that. IF so, it just needs to be mounted in fstab.
[05:40] <rBlong2us> I will miss the dri based games though
[05:40] <rBlong2us> hi anyone?
[05:40] <rBlong2us> any suggestions?
[05:40] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: Try each and see which does best, use: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh to speed up the process by only having it ask you what driver and resolution to use.
[05:40] <rBlong2us> Jordan_U: thanks
[05:41] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: Have you filed a bug report?
[05:41] <nicolas_> is the sata2 ok with edgy ?
[05:42] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, Thanks for the help! ill see if i can figure out how to determine which partition is what :d
[05:42] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, most likely swap, as what could have been there before?
[05:42] <rBlong2us> Jordan_U: I think I should, you know what because all the new X driver for sis, from Gentoo, Ubuntu and PuppyOS make the lcd flicker like hell. I've got an old puppy LiveCD from summer with X working fine, so I am just suspecting something has gone wrong with a new X sis driver
[05:43] <niru> can anybody let me know which all indian languages does ubuntu edgy support
[05:43] <jStefan> !swap
[05:43] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[05:43] <niru> And also what architectures does ubuntu edgy supports
[05:43] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, well, i have the ntfs winXP partition....an ext3 partition, and two others
[05:43] <jStefan> !swap > radioaktivstorm
[05:43] <jStefan> that wiki might say something helpful
[05:43] <aro_ron> hey all
[05:44] <Jordan_U> rBlong2us: File soon, while Feisty is still in the begginning stages and mabie a fix will be included by release.
[05:44] <aro_ron> I need some help installing edgy
[05:44] <sigger> I may have borked my password file.  before I exited sudo -i I noticed that the passwd's were in cleartext.  when I exited sudo -i, I couldn't sudo and now I can't log in.  anyone?
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> niru what architecture are you curious about?
[05:44] <niru> jStefan:could you please answer to my previous messages
[05:44] <aro_ron> I had been running dapper since its release in june
[05:44] <niru> I want to prepare a difference chart.so I need to know aout what all arch. does ubuntu edgy support
[05:44] <jStefan> niru, don't know the answer
[05:44] <aro_ron> but managed to bork my upgrade to edgy, so I am tryingto instal from scratch
[05:45] <MasterOfDisaster> niru: i386, AMD64, PPC, SPARC...
[05:45] <aro_ron> but I cant get the installer to actually install
[05:45] <jStefan> MasterOfDisaster, we still have SPARC ?
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> niru go to the ubuntu.com site
[05:45] <MasterOfDisaster> for server, yea
[05:45] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: On what architecture
[05:45] <niru> MasterOfDisaster:And which all indian languages
[05:45] <aro_ron> I tell it to put the mount point for root on the existing ext3 partition, but it refuses to mount and install
[05:45] <aro_ron> keeps saying there isno root file system. well duh, I havent installed it yet
[05:45] <MasterOfDisaster> 6.06 anyways...
[05:45] <aro_ron> any ideas?
[05:46] <ala> anyone know how to pipe a file into eclipse?
[05:46] <aios> Akuma_:
[05:46] <aro_ron> jourdan_U its x86
[05:46] <rBlong2us> ok re-starting
[05:46] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: x86 arch
[05:47] <radioaktivstorm> jStefan, this looks really promising... maybe ill just go with making a swap file and deal with the partition later....
[05:47] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: Did you reformat the partition first? ( the liveCD installer is picky )
[05:47] <specialbrad> Anyone know how to deal with unresolvable dependances with Synaptic?
[05:47] <str0ng> hello..
[05:47] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, ok
[05:47] <broyce> Hello - I could use some help with postfix - anyone out there that can handle this
[05:47] <Jordan_U> specialbrad: What package?
[05:47] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: not yet, think that will do it? cause the instaler has a reformat option, but it wont run it
[05:47] <str0ng> is there a tool that i can use in order to explicitly enable specific IP's for NAT?
[05:48] <MasterOfDisaster> dependancy issues are from too many repositories, usually
[05:48] <specialbrad> Jordan_U: libusb-dev
[05:48] <jStefan> radioaktivstorm, check the troubleshooting section too
[05:48] <Jordan_U> specialbrad: What error does it give when you try to reformat?
[05:48] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: What error does it give when you try to reformat?
[05:49] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: That last comment was for aro_ron, sorry.
[05:49] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: it simply says no root filesystem
[05:49] <river> jStefan, in my chroot terminal session, I unmounted /media/cdrom which was my /dev/hdc and instead mounted /dev/hdd in its place and the upgrade seems to be away
[05:49] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: When in gparted?
[05:49] <jStefan> river, sounds good
[05:50] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: no, gparted seems to deal with it alright, its when I click next to set the mount points that it stops
[05:50] <specialbrad> MasterOfDisaster: Hrmf, I'll trying removing my non official ones and see if that works out
[05:50] <MasterOfDisaster> yea, disabling the 3rd party ones usually works
[05:50] <tgelter> if I installed something with sudo python setup.py install , how do I remove it?
[05:50] <specialbrad> MasterOfDisaster: Worked, thanks a ton
[05:50] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: I am running it live right now, so I can try anything
[05:50] <river> jStefan, and Jordan_U thanks for your very patient assist over the last couple of days...with some luck, this will complete and fix the interupted upgrade and will be able to boot of the hdd once again
[05:50] <santeria[FL] > ok i tried ubuntu in safe graphics mode and it did the same vertical line thing, now kubuntu doesnt even take me to that command prompt thing it does the same as ubuntu
[05:51] <Jordan_U> specialbrad: Also try: sudo apt-get -f install
[05:51] <bimberi> tgelter: sudo python setup.py uninstall   ??
[05:51] <santeria[FL] > and i tried moving my mouse but i dont think thatll work anyway because i ahve a usb mouse
[05:51] <tgelter> bimberi: no go...thanks for trying though
[05:51] <timbobsteve> hi all
[05:51] <MasterOfDisaster> HI!
[05:51] <santeria[FL] > im gettin frustrated
[05:52] <aios> is it safe to delete the mounted drive icons that ubuntu sets on the desktop when installing?
[05:52] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : You can press ctrl+alt+F2 to get to an ungarbled terminal.
[05:52] <santeria[FL] > i is confoosed
=== Harnak is now known as irc
[05:52] <timbobsteve> i just apt-get'd linux-image-2.6.17-10-powerpc .... but after a reboot `uname -r` still says I am using 2.6.15-26-powerpc.... any idea how to switch them over?
[05:52] <santeria[FL] > so when it shows the horizontal/some times verticle lines and color stuff, press control alt f2?
[05:53] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Yes.
[05:53] <santeria[FL] > ok ill try...
[05:53] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: I still have all the leftover files from my borked dapper install, inclusing my GRUB instal for dual booting with XP. could any of that be affecting it?
[05:53] <Cholito> weird stuff: I can't hear anything (the computer I mean....) but I see amarok showing the analizer moving. I was watching a movie today so I KNOW the sound card works
[05:53] <linlin> anyone in or near Miami, FL ?
[05:53] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : You may need to install the nvidia drivers from the terminal also, but ther is also a possibility neither of those things will work.
[05:54] <Cholito> I tried using headphones and speakers and nothing
[05:54] <timbobsteve> can anyone help with a kernel upgrade?
[05:55] <skelter> Cholito: same thing happened to me
[05:55] <skelter> i came in here to figure out how to fix it :s
[05:55] <Cholito> skelter: really?
[05:55] <Cholito> crap
[05:55] <Jordan_U> aro_ron: If you still have files from dapper, did you not reformat or do you just have another partition?
[05:55] <Cholito> dist-upgraded?
[05:55] <skelter> yes, but sound worked after the upgrade
[05:55] <skelter> stopped i think yesterday
[05:55] <Cholito> uhmmmm
[05:55] <skelter> i didn't notice till i tried to run some music
[05:56] <Cholito> same here LOL
[05:56] <aro_ron> Jordan_U: I havnt reformatted yet, as I was expecting the installer to do that. I have a NTFS and an EXT3 partition
[05:56] <Cholito> do you have amaroth repositories?
[05:56] <Jordan_U> Cholito: Did you watch any flash videos recently by any chance?
[05:56] <skelter> i don't believe so
[05:56] <Cholito> Jordan_U: yeap :S
[05:56] <MasterOfDisaster> *sigh*
[05:56] <skelter> and i know i didn't see any flash, since i am on a 64bit proc...flash doesn't work
[05:56] <orangey> mysql
[05:56] <MasterOfDisaster> flash is so screwed up for linux...
[05:57] <Cholito> yes I was trying to see the new Ikea catalog LOL
[05:57] <Jordan_U> Cholito: Flash 7 screws up sound, restart then install flash9 instead
[05:57] <Cholito> restart FF?
[05:57] <Jordan_U> !flash9 Cholito
[05:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about flash9 Cholito - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:57] <skelter> how about for me...any way you could help me troubleshoot?
[05:58] <Jordan_U> Cholito: Your system, there is a command to just restart the sound but I can't find it again, restarting the computer will do it though.

[06:12] <santeria[FL] > so jordan is it a set list of commands i can just write down and punch in?
[06:12] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Yes.
[06:12] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : sudo software-properties -e universe
[06:12] <Jordan_U> sudo apt-get update
[06:12] <Jordan_U> sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx
[06:12] <Jordan_U> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[06:12] <Jordan_U> ( choose nvidia when asked what driver to use )
[06:12] <Jordan_U> sudo gdm
[06:12] <Vuen> hey all, i set up ssh on this computer, but i also have a guest account. how can i disable guest from logging in through ssh?
[06:12] <stylus> Hmm, lookups are taking ages since I installed ubuntu. Anything I should know?
[06:13] <sigger_> I never set a root pw and I thought I read that root account was "locked" by default
[06:13] <noxxle> how long does it take YOU to reach a fully loaded desktop from power on?
[06:13] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Except that first line should say restricted instead of universe :)
[06:14] <wastrel> see why would you need to chroot when you can just edit the file on the mounted drive?
[06:14] <Flannel> sigger_: you're correct, ubuntu uses sudo
[06:14] <santeria[FL] > so sudo software-properties -e restricted?
[06:14] <Flannel> !sudo | sigger_
[06:14] <ubotu> sigger_: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:14] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Yes.
[06:14] <bimberi> sigger_: 'locked' means that it doesn't have a password setup.  So you should get straight to a root shell in recovery mode
[06:15] <sigger_> I was using sudo (hehe, that's how I got in this mess ;)) but since my pw's are borked, no access
[06:15] <pungie> I am a newbie... I had my wireless with wep key workig great.. I just bought a new linksys router and now, I can't get dhcp to work.. I try static ip that fails. Yet I can see it in the gui. I can see it when I do iwlist scanning... And if I leave the machine on overnight, sometimes it will magically be working again
[06:15] <noxxle> edgy is WAY slower to boot than dapper
[06:15] <pungie> <--- very frustrated
[06:16] <Xaxafrad> hi, i'm a stoopid noob, finished installing xubuntu and am trying to change grub's default boot option. i made the proper edits to /boot/grub/menu.lst, but it can't open the file for writing. am i supposed to use a special program for editing this file?
[06:16] <cyrenity> hi
[06:16] <Jordan_U> noxxle: Usually it is the other way around.
[06:16] <Cholito> crap, sound still not working
[06:16] <pungie> xaxafrad : use sudo
[06:16] <bimberi> Xaxafrad: you need to edit it as superuser - eg. sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:16] <noxxle> jordan how long does it take you to reach your desktop after powr on?
[06:17] <Xaxafrad> ah, thanx
[06:17] <Jordan_U> noxxle: never timed it.
[06:17] <concept10> if he didnt use sudp in the first place, he wouldnt have been able to save (modify) the file
[06:17] <LGKeiz> pungie - make sure you have the correct mode, channel, etc
[06:17] <noxxle> you should.
[06:17] <LGKeiz> I just recently got mine working :P
[06:17] <Jordan_U> noxxle: Why?
[06:17] <noxxle> because i want to know, and im important
[06:17] <pungie> Hmm. mode and channel, how do I do that in /network/interfacces?
[06:17] <LGKeiz> you don't
[06:17] <LGKeiz> pungie - get wifi-radar
[06:18] <Xaxafrad> should i have sudo?
[06:18] <jmoncayo> sorry to bother with an out of topic question but is there somebody from paris around here?
[06:18] <mikebot> can someone here help me with the opera web browser?
[06:18] <pungie> ok, apt-get install wifi-radar and then do what with it... very new, so any more direction before I reboot and try?
[06:18] <LGKeiz> pungie - go to .. err
[06:18] <LGKeiz> sec
[06:18] <Vuen> i set up ssh on this computer, but i also have a guest account. how can i disable guest from logging in through ssh?
[06:18] <LGKeiz> let me boot up my system
[06:18] <dungodung> what's the file for setting up what partitions are going to be automounted?
[06:18] <Madpilot> mikebot, sure, if you actually ask a question about it ;)
[06:18] <viikio> hi guys, i need help playing flash videos in firefox.. i can play them in windows but not in ubuntu.. i've already installed flash player 7 for linux
[06:18] <pungie> googling wifi radar rihgt now
[06:19] <mikebot> Madpilot: heh, ok, i am trying to add a serach thing, and i want it to put a '+' for a space instead of a '%20'
[06:19] <LGKeiz> pungie - dapper or edgy?
[06:19] <Jordan_U> !fstab | dungodung
[06:19] <ubotu> dungodung: The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions
[06:19] <dungodung> ah, thanks
[06:19] <pungie> dapper
[06:19] <LGKeiz> ah
[06:19] <Madpilot> mikebot, ah... not sure; %20 is just the encoding for a blank space
[06:19] <LGKeiz> pungie it is really recommanded to upgrade
[06:19] <pungie> the old router worked fine before... now this new one is 'flakey'
[06:19] <mikebot> Madpilot: ok, i have another question for you then
[06:19] <LGKeiz> o_o;
[06:19] <pungie> Yeah need an inet connection to upgrade =)
[06:19] <sigger_> Vuen: you can use the usermod program to make the default script for guest /bin/false
[06:20] <Xaxafrad> i don't think i have sudo....
[06:20] <sigger_> Vuen: i.e. do not let them execute a login script
[06:20] <LGKeiz> pungie okay. the dapper repo doesn't have wifi-radar so you gotta manually find it, and install it
[06:20] <pungie> ok can do that
[06:20] <tuxtheslacker> http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre2/48185-2.jpg what desklet manager is that?
[06:20] <pungie> So I will take over my ifconfig and ifup ifdown network interfaces etc?
[06:20] <smoenux> does anyone know of any link to help me with my router?
[06:20] <smoenux> !router
[06:20] <Jordan_U> Xaxafrad: Why do you say that?
[06:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about router - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:20] <mikebot> Madpilot: i tried to get ubuntu to work on this computer, but i can't get internet (i am on a school lan), and when i type in a terminal 'dhclient' i get: 'No DHCPOFFERS recieved. No working leases in persistent database.'
[06:20] <Xaxafrad> it's not in /bin
[06:21] <LGKeiz> pungie - yeah it'll take over everything
[06:21] <santeria[FL] > here goes nothing
[06:21] <pungie> thanks LGKeiz, I will give that a chance
[06:21] <tuxtheslacker> mikebot, are you sure they don't assign you an IP?
[06:21] <wastrel> sudo is in /usr/bin
[06:21] <Kingsqueak> Dapper has wifi-radar in it
[06:21] <dungodung> one more question: is it safe for me to format (using gparted, if that matters) the first (boot) partition of a secondary hdd
[06:21] <Vuen> sigger_: ah. that works, thanks :)
[06:21] <Kingsqueak> apt-cache search wifi-radar    it's there
[06:21] <pungie> Its  bizarre because it works some tmes and I can't get static to work for me for the life
[06:21] <sigger_> Vuen :)
[06:21] <LGKeiz> pungie when you get this installed, you will need to iwlist <device> scan and get the mode and channel and manually set it in wifi-radar which has a gui to help you, and automatically detects networks
[06:21] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : You need to be connected to the internet also. See you when you get back :)
[06:22] <pungie> cool
[06:22] <pungie> thanks LGKeiz I will hopefully get this happy
[06:22] <santeria[FL] > roger roger
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you finally get your driver working?
[06:22] <squeee> Can you run beryl with 2 monitors with ati?
[06:22] <Madpilot> mikebot, I know very little about networking; mine's always just worked, happily. For the Opera question, do try the Opera Forums, they can be very good.
[06:22] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak of course
[06:22] <pungie> rebooting now.. thanks
[06:22] <mikebot> Madpilot: ok, well, thanks
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you should have stuck to nm-applet ;-) it would do WPA for you at least
[06:22] <clop> when i try to apt-get remove totem, it tries to uninstall ubuntu-desktop... is that an important package?
[06:22] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak ndiswrapper -> driver, I had the wrong driver, kingsqueak, network-manager wouldn't work for me.. but wifi-radar worked perfectly
[06:22] <Madpilot> clop, only when it's time to upgrade to the next release of Ubuntu
[06:23] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: weird, glad you got it working
[06:23] <Jordan_U> squeee: Try #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl , they know more about the specifics of beryl.
[06:23] <squeee> jordan: k thanks
[06:23] <clop> Madpilot, is there a way for me to find out what is in that package?
[06:23] <tuxtheslacker> can someone tell me of another desklet program aside from gdesklet?
[06:24] <Jbirk> CAn someone tell me a package that lets me record video of what is on the screen?
[06:24] <Madpilot> clop, it's just a meta-package, to get other stuff w/ content to actually install. Removing it doesn't remove the rest of the packages it installs.
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> hihi
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak :)
[06:24] <Kingsqueak> heh
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak mIRC @ linux = funny
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Wine <3
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lol
[06:24] <Kingsqueak> try irssi
[06:24] <clop> Madpilot, oh, alright, thanks :)
[06:24] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I'm a mIRC scripter
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> or if you like GUI, xchat
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> heh
[06:25] <Vuen> sigger_: ah, found a better way. i can simply add AllowUsers nick in the sshd_config to only allow myself to login. that way guest can still log in to a terminal.
[06:25] <dungodung> yeah, crazily enough, wine works with mirc
[06:25] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> :p
[06:25] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I use it.
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> time for sleep
[06:25] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> later mate
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> night
[06:25] <viikio> hi guys, i need help playing flash videos in firefox.. i can play them in windows but not in ubuntu.. i've already installed flash player 7 for linux.. i can play videos on youtube but.. im trying to view something which is on my machine, a webpage which plays videos.. it displays the page properly but the videos dont work.. is there something else i need?
[06:25] <sigger_> Vuen: ok, but  I thought you didn't want guest to be able to login
[06:26] <Vuen> sigger_: i don't want guest to login through ssh. i want them to be able to login locally
[06:26] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> l>.>
[06:26] <sigger_> oooh
[06:26] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> School tomorrow :
[06:26] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> :(
[06:26] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, try flash 9 beta?
[06:26] <skelter> viikio - 64bit proc by any chance?
[06:26] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, the site probably requires newer version of flash.
[06:27] <viikio> ok.. i'll try flash 9
[06:27] <skelter> because adobe doesn't make a 64 bit version of flash player for linux
[06:27] <viikio> hm.... 64 bit? how do i know if im 64 bit?
[06:27] <Cholito> alsamixer works for me and still no sound
[06:28] <Xaxafrad> is /usr/bin not in the path already? i click on "applications", "run program...", then type "sudo gedit <file>" but nothing happens
[06:28] <skelter> generally it is one of the listed features when you get a new computer
[06:28] <ThomBrown> any pointers for me?  I'm trying to mount my Kodak camera in Edgy
[06:28] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, what processor do you have? intel or AMD?
[06:28] <viikio> ....somebody gave this to me.. i have intel centrino duo
[06:28] <B_166-ER-X> !edgytorrentproblem
[06:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about edgytorrentproblem - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:28] <skelter> torrent works fine for me w/ edgy
[06:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> hmm..
[06:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> You know that bottom gui on MAC
[06:29] <B_166-ER-X> why does on edgy, i cannot start more than one torrent download ? (with bittorrent client, and freeloader just doenst work)
[06:29] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Can you get that Ubuntu somehow?
[06:29] <ThomBrown> no camera mounting help, then?
[06:30] <jStefan> viikio, "uname -a" in terminal
[06:30] <Cranky-E17> !eclair
[06:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about eclair - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:30] <wastrel> Xaxafrad:  sudo is a command-line program, for gedit use gksudo
[06:30] <tuxtheslacker> jStefan, what's he looking for?
[06:30] <Xaxafrad> oh
[06:30] <cedriczg> B_166-ER-X,  Maybe it is a today problem with torrent.. For me right now it is really slow
[06:30] <jStefan> tuxtheslacker, 32bit / 64bit
[06:31] <squeee> Is it possible to do a vnc connection while a computer is at gdm?
[06:31] <viikio> uname -a: 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 18:45:35 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[06:31] <Xaxafrad> so "gksudo /boot/grub/menu.lst" should work?
[06:31] <B_166-ER-X> cedriczg,  nope, i read about it on forums , but it wasnt resolved...
[06:31] <B_166-ER-X> and its not 'slow' it just dont want to start
[06:31] <skelter> viikio: that looks like 32bit to me. so try installing the latest flash player
[06:31] <tuxtheslacker> jStefan, lspci | grep processor should do it, not uname.
[06:31] <Flannel> Xaxafrad: you need to stick gedit in there (your editor)
[06:31] <cedriczg> B_166-ER-X,  So what's the real problem?
[06:31] <jStefan> tuxtheslacker, he asked for "running"
[06:31] <viikio> seems like flash 7 is the newest.. i just visited the site
[06:32] <tuxtheslacker> ohhhh!
[06:32] <skelter> flannel: if you have a 64 bit, you will see x86_64 in uname
[06:32] <Jordan_U_> Xaxafrad: no "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
[06:32] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, flash 9 is in beta.
[06:32] <digivore> why can't i view my root files in konqueror?  i used to be able to...?  i can only see my home dir...
[06:32] <tuxtheslacker> there's a link to it in the restricted formats.
[06:32] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, ^^
[06:32] <B_166-ER-X> cedriczg,  that i cannot start more than one torrent ?
[06:32] <tuxtheslacker> viikio, it comes out officially in january.
[06:32] <Jordan_U_> !flash9 | viikio
[06:32] <ubotu> viikio: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[06:32] <cedriczg> B_166-ER-X,  ok
[06:33] <Jordan_U_> viikio: IMHO flash9 seems much less "beta" than the joke that is flash 7.
[06:33] <squeee> jordan: I can crash flash 9 easily, flash 7 i have a harder time with

[06:34] <viikio> thanks for the links!
[06:34] <Cholito> the funny thing is that amarok looks like is playing sound...
[06:34] <Jordan_U_> squeee: But at least it doesn't break your sound ( I know aoss, but still )
[06:35] <squeee> jordan: both have sound that work just fine for me, but the av sync sucks in 7
[06:35] <Xaxafrad> i don't see gedit in either /bin or /usr/bin
[06:36] <Jordan_U_> squeee: Try playing sound from another application at the same time though... and yeh, the av sync sucks for everybody :)
[06:36] <Xaxafrad> i tried mousepad but got a empty file

[06:39] <asarch> Hi everyone, how is it getting along?
[06:40] <tich> i just tried to load my nvidia driver (following the wiki) which i have done many times before and this time it won't load. help?
[06:40] <Jordan_U_> tich: Any errors?
[06:40] <Xaxafrad> if the 'r' key is broken on my laptop, is there an alternate way to maybe copy and paste an r into the run program box?
[06:41] <Cholito> Xaxafrad: use the mouse (the middle button
[06:41] <asarch> Hi guys, I am having a little problem with the installation program
[06:41] <tich> Jordan_U_, yes. unable to load nvidia kernal driver be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[06:41] <cedriczg> Xaxafrad, or if you don't have middle button push lef and rifght button at the same time
[06:41] <Xaxafrad> cholito: you mean the scroll button, or do i have the wrong kind of mouse?
[06:42] <BHSPitMonkey> ausimage, and nobody else is experiencing what you are, to my knowledge. sounds like the problem is on your end
[06:42] <ro1> hey i did a lshw -C
[06:42] <asarch> You'll see: I already been using Fedora and when I select the first partition of my hd the programs shows an error that there is no root partition
[06:42] <ro1> on network
[06:42] <ro1> i saw my wireless is disabled
[06:42] <tich> Jordan_U_, which should be no problem because that is the first step in the wiki
[06:42] <ro1> where do i go from there
[06:42] <cedriczg> Xaxafrad, I think the scroll button should work as well
[06:43] <asarch> Xaxafrad: press both mouse button from your laptop to paste the text
[06:43] <ro1> can anyone help with
[06:43] <Jordan_U_> tich: Did you compile a custom kernel?
[06:43] <Xaxafrad> yeah! (l+r did the trick :)
[06:43] <ro1> lshw -C
[06:43] <cedriczg> Xaxafrad, select the text (don't even have to do a crtl-c) and then use the middle button of the mouse to paste
[06:44] <tich> Jordan_U_, i don't think so... if i could do it accidently i might have but i don't think that is possible.
[06:44] <ausimage> Can anyone explain why bash scripts located on a mounted partition under /media gives me a bad interpreter: no permission? The script runs fine from the home directory.
[06:44] <ro1> Jordan: Can you help with lshw stuff
[06:44] <Jordan_U_> tich: No, it isn't :)
[06:44] <Xaxafrad> thanx guys
[06:44] <tich> Jordan_U_, i switched from the generic to 386 (restricted modules)
[06:44] <Xaxafrad> (and gals?)
[06:44] <cedriczg> Xaxafrad, Your welcome
[06:45] <Cholito> Xaxafrad: sorry, yes, the one in the scroll
[06:45] <Jordan_U_> tich: You need to install the generic package, it will still use the 386 modules.
[06:46] <Cholito> I see you got it working...
[06:46] <tich> Jordan_U_, should i uninstall the 386 package, the first time i tried to enable it they were both installed
[06:46] <Jordan_U_> tich: No, they should both be installed.
[06:47] <darius_> Is Easy Ubuntu a good tool for Edgy?
[06:47] <jStefan> !easyubuntu | darius_

[06:47] <Jordan_U_> darius_: You don't need it, but I havn't heard of problems with it like I have with automatix
[06:47] <Cholito> crap, no sound yet...
[06:48] <tich> Jordan_U_, when i uninstalled it removed something else as well but it isn't going to put it back with the reinstall is that okay?

[06:50] <cedriczg> Can anyone tell me the better fortrtand compiler to use? or other solution
[06:50] <Vuen> question, how can i make sudo require the root password instead of my user password? and this information used to be in ubuntuguide, where has it gone?
[06:50] <Vuen> cedriczg: apt-get install gfortran g77
[06:50] <tich_> Jordan_U_, if you responded to my last question i missed it my connection stopped for a coupe of seconds. sorry.
[06:50] <cedriczg> thanx
[06:51] <Jordan_U_> Vuen: In that case you might as whell just enable the root account.
[06:51] <Jordan_U_> tich_: What isn't it going to put back?
[06:52] <cedriczg> Vuen, merci beaucoup
[06:52] <tich_> Jordan_U_, i don't know, i didn't write down what it removed, i thought it was okay
[06:53] <Jordan_U_> tich_: It should be, I just wanted to be sure.
[06:53] <ausimage> Could I get an answer to my query about why bash scripts are being difficult on mounted drives. It worked under dapper.
[06:53] <Vuen> cedriczg: no problem. keep in mind this is two different compilers, one for fortran 95 and one for fortran 77.
[06:53] <Vuen> so make sure you compile with the right one
[06:53] <Jordan_U_> ausimage: Are you using #!/bin/sh at the start?
[06:53] <Caplain_> is there a guide for ethernet bridging in ubuntu?

[06:54] <ausimage> Yeah... I am these scripts are liked on a /media/* mounted partition and complain loudly about bad interpreter permission denied
[06:54] <Fallen_Angel> Caplain_ : see this "how to" http://www.howtoforge.org/
[06:54] <Jordan_U_> ausimage: In Edgy /bin/sh != /bin/bash
[06:54] <cedriczg> viikio, flash 9 in lnux?!!
[06:55] <tich_> Jordan_U_,  i tried to enable it again but i still get the same warning.
[06:55] <Daehlie> labs.adobe.com
[06:55] <Jordan_U_> ausimage: Use /bin/bash
[06:55] <Caplain_> Fallen_Angel: ok thx
[06:55] <viikio> yeah.. the guys gave the link to me
[06:55] <ausimage> Jordan_U the same script on /home/* runs no problem
[06:55] <cedriczg> viikio, is it available?
[06:55] <NewcomerXb> Hey everyone. Im having issues with this "cannot detect HAL" thing
[06:55] <joelliot> hi ,,, can grub be installed to root partition with ubuntu 6.10 live cd?
[06:55] <viikio> it's in beta
[06:55] <NewcomerXb> I think its affecting my graphics
[06:55] <floating> how do I know if I have ndiswrapper-utils installed ? I have installed ndiswrapper, but I cvant get it work, and plannin to try older version. uninstallation guide says also to "apt-get remove ndiswrapper-utils" and I cant do that
[06:55] <Jordan_U_> tich_: It said your running kernel, so you may need to restart.
[06:56] <genbie> anyone can access http:www.optionsxpresseurope.com with firefox here please?
[06:56] <Jordan_U_> joelliot: Yes.
[06:56] <tich_> Jordan_U_, yeah i give it a shot.
[06:56] <floating> http://www.optionsxpresseurope.com
[06:56] <e_machinist> I'm using Dapper, 6.06, and firefox 2.0 is not in any of my repositories (I have mutli and univ enabled). Is there a backports repository from Edgy or something that I am missing?
[06:56] <Jordan_U_> joelliot: There is an option during the installer to install grub to a different partition.
[06:56] <santeria[FL] > grr linux hates me
[06:56] <genbie> yes floating thanks
[06:57] <floating> can access
[06:57] <joelliot> Jorddan_U  thanks ,,, will give it a try
[06:57] <Jordan_U_> santeria[FL] : Didn't work I guess?
[06:57] <NewcomerXb> Ubuntu isnt mounting my drives right at all. I have to flick off and flick on my external HD suddenly when it lags during bootup
[06:57] <genbie> floating i can't!! can you tell what could possible be wrong?
[06:57] <NewcomerXb> That must have somnething to do with "cant detect HAL"
=== Jordan_U_ is now known as Jordan_U
[06:57] <abes> Hello :] 
[06:57] <goose> how do you figure out where a package has installed files?
[06:57] <Daehlie> e_machinist: just dist upgrade if you want firefox 2.0 or build it from source
[06:57] <floating> genbie: no i cant tell :i
[06:57] <NewcomerXb> hello abes
[06:57] <genbie> ok!!
[06:58] <goose> i know synaptic has something but is there a way to do it from command line?
[06:58] <santeria[FL] > ok on the second line: sudo apt-get update it said somehting like ign www.ubuntu.com some file [191b]  and i figured 191 bytes should take less than a second but it just stayed there
[06:58] <abes> Can anyone tell me if thats possible to get my turn off and restart buttons back to the screen that appears after I click on the [( I )]  button?
[06:58] <abes> the turn off button
[06:58] <e_machinist> Daehlie: I will build from source. One Q though: when I do the full upgrade, will this redownload everything, or only whats out of date and new stuff? (Which is probably most everything).
=== CreativeEmbassy is now known as Cre[a] tiveEmb[a] 
[06:58] <NewcomerXb> So i guess nobody knows :(
[06:59] <abes> i just have log out, lock screen, switch user and hibernate
[06:59] <Daehlie> it will only download what is updated, which is almost every package
[06:59] <genbie> network access issue: happens with all browsers on ubuntu but no problem on windows: anyone can access http://www.optionsxpresseurope.com please?
[06:59] <abes> and also my wi-fi was working properly and just stopped randomly... tried most of the stuff i found online but no luck
[06:59] <e_machinist> Daehlie: yah, that is what I figured. I'll just get an ISO.
[06:59] <tich_> Jordan_U, nvidia didn't load even after the restart. i get the same warning.
[07:00] <abes> genbie: works fine with firefox 2.0
[07:00] <tich_> nothing about this edgy install has been simple
[07:00] <santeria[FL] > tru dat
[07:00] <genbie> abes thanks i get a "Firefox can't find the server at www.optionsxpresseurope.com" error
[07:00] <santeria[FL] > ugh
[07:00] <abes> genbie: hmmm... is it with only that website?
[07:00] <Cholito> still no sound
[07:00] <Daehlie> e_machinist: thats the way to go, i did a dist upgrade, waited 2 hours, when it was done gnome is broken and I end up running the install anyway
[07:00] <genbie> yes abes
[07:01] <Cholito> I have no idea where to look =(
[07:01] <abes> genbie: have you tried pinging that host?
[07:01] <pradeep> Hello, I need help installing ubuntu from iso (without cd rom). I've looked at ubuntu forums, but none seem to helpful.
[07:01] <Jordan_U> tich_: Try asking on #ubuntu-xgl , just tell them you just need help with the drivers and not XGL.
[07:01] <Cholito> amarok still looks like it's playing sound (no error or anything) but nothing comes from the speakers
[07:01] <tich_> Jordan_U, okay thanks
[07:01] <santeria[FL] > anyone got any ideas with my little delimma?
[07:01] <abes> so anyobody? any idea about why there are not turn off and restart options anymroe?
[07:01] <abes> or why would wi-fi randomly stop working
[07:02] <abes> ?
[07:02] <genbie> abes pinging is OK
[07:02] <abes> genbie: do u have firefox 2.0?
[07:02] <santeria[FL] > ok on the second line: sudo apt-get update it said somehting like ign www.ubuntu.com some file [191b]  and i figured 191 bytes should take less than a second but it just stayed there
[07:02] <genbie> yes abes
[07:03] <e_machinist> Daehlie: thanks for your assistance.
[07:03] <pungie> Ok I am back.. I got wifi radar, did iwlist ath0 and got the info.. it connects but with DHCP I get no ip address =(... I try static and I can't even ping teh gateway
[07:03] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : It shouldn't have, did any of the files download or did it get stuck on the first?
[07:03] <pradeep> bah ! :/
[07:03] <abes> genbie: hmmm maybe theres something with your dns
[07:03] <santeria[FL] > i think it might have gotten thruough a couple
[07:03] <NewcomerXb> Nobody knows what to do about the "can't detect HAL" thing? Anyone? c.c >.>
[07:03] <genbie> how can i solve that abes plz?!
[07:03] <santeria[FL] > but you would think 191 b would be fast as a blink of an eye
[07:04] <pungie> I nkow the router works, because my windows box connects no isseus
[07:04] <abes> genbie: i cant ping it... hold on a sec...
[07:04] <viikio> how can i replace a file in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins? it wont let me paste there.. how can i make it work?
[07:04] <genbie> abes ok thanx
[07:04] <pradeep> viiko, you have to be root
[07:04] <NewcomerXb> ok, ill look elsewhere
[07:04] <santeria[FL] > do you think if i put my monitor on my motherboard vga port i could get into ubuntu and then install the nvidia drivers from the actual os?
[07:05] <NewcomerXb> Eeep it said i had messages.
[07:05] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : All I can say is that shouldn't have happened and to try again, if it fails again press ctrl+x to stop it then run the command again ( press the up arrow and you won't have to type it in again )
[07:05] <viikio> how do i become root?
[07:05] <pungie> is wifi not working on a new router or working randomly a common ubuntu occurance
[07:05] <santeria[FL] > ok
[07:05] <Madpilot> viikio, you don't need to. User sudo & your own user password
[07:05] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Make that ctrl+c :)
[07:05] <santeria[FL] > is that command necesary? what does it do exactly
[07:05] <abes> genbie: try http://69.25.159.40 and see if it opens
[07:05] <santeria[FL] > does it update the os or something?
[07:06] <pungie> any other ideas on if i can connect to the router, I can see it...  but cant get an ip.. staically picking one, cant ping the gateway
[07:06] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : It tells apt where to download the drivers from.
[07:06] <viikio> i should do that using terminal?
[07:06] <abes> pungie: what do you mean by i can see it? like see it standing on the shelf? :P
[07:06] <pungie> no.. I can see it by if I do  iwlist ath0 scanning, the router appears and shows me its info... it pops up in my list in wifi radar
[07:07] <santeria[FL] > tell me if i got the next command after that right : install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx
[07:07] <santeria[FL] > or
[07:07] <abes> pungie: maybe you have mac filtering on or the wep/wpa key is incorrect - double-check those first
[07:07] <santeria[FL] > sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx
[07:07] <abes> genbie: so... did it open?
[07:07] <pungie> ok.. i know its not mac filtering on my router.. maybe I have typo in the key, but did double check.. I will try that again.. .was seeing any other ideas
[07:08] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx
[07:08] <abes> pungie: try disabling encryption completely first and see if it connects
[07:08] <santeria[FL] > i guess thats right then
[07:08] <abes> pungie: so at least you know that hardware on both ends is ok
[07:08] <santeria[FL] > ok

[07:08] <genbie> abes yes it opens but very slow and bad page layout
[07:09] <pungie> ok. will do that... the weird thing is i left my machine on over night and the next day it was connceted.. next reboot no more
[07:09] <abes> d
[07:09] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Good luck :)
[07:09] <abes> genbie: well it may not load the css properly
[07:09] <pungie> will try that again
[07:09] <santeria[FL] > i'll need it =\
[07:09] <abes> genbie: but the page loads with IP but not with the hostname, right?
[07:09] <genbie> yes abes
[07:10] <abes> Need help: no "Turn off" or "Restart" icons when i press the "Log out/Turn off" button
[07:10] <pungie> do wifi radar know by default the key is Hexadecimal? if I do it by hand in /etc/network/interfaces i jus
[07:10] <abes> pungie: you can do it in interfaces and just copy it from whatever it is in the router
[07:10] <abes> pungie: are you using wep or wpa
[07:10] <abes> genbie: so then it is your dns most likely
[07:10] <pungie> I am using wep

[07:11] <genbie> oh ok abes ;-)
[07:11] <Vaske_Car> abes, I had the same problem, restarted PC with button and its OK now
[07:12] <abes> re-align: WPA may need some extra modules to support WPA
[07:12] <abes> Vaske_Car: well... didnt work with me... whatever - its not a biggie... ;] 
[07:12] <abes> Vaske_Car: thanks anyways
[07:12] <Vaske_Car> np

[07:20] <santeria[FL] > is there another version of ubuntu that would work better?

[07:21] <santeria[FL] > ok
[07:21] <abes> hehe
[07:21] <santeria[FL] > more stable?
[07:21] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Or the alternate install for Edgy.
[07:21] <santeria[FL] > would 64 bit work better?
[07:21] <Pablo> is edgy unstable?
[07:21] <sambos> i installed ATI drivers now my fonts are ugly why?

[07:24] <collin> do
[07:24] <santeria[FL] > i should download dapper drake correct?
[07:24] <genbie> pablo how plz? in which file?
[07:24] <rBlong2us> hi how disconect a camera? Should I just inplugged it?
[07:25] <Pablo> in /etc/resolv.conf
[07:25] <rBlong2us> I don't know I just wanna do this properly
[07:25] <genbie> and tehn restart pablo?
[07:25] <santeria[FL] > and is 64 bit worth downloading? or does it end up being like xp 64 bit where there are no drivers ever
[07:25] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : If you don't want to have to jump through hoops to get your video working, yes.
[07:25] <santeria[FL] > yes to 64 bit? or yes to dapper drake
[07:25] <rBlong2us> must I just unplugge it? I Bill Gate$ $oftware I have to "Safely REmove Device"
[07:25] <tich_> Jordan_U,  here is the excerpt: Note: you have to select the restricted modules first because the nvidia-glx package automatically installs the i386 one - and if you have a generic kernel image, the X will not work
[07:26] <genbie> abes i will change the ip addresses in etc/resolve.comf and restart
[07:26] <Pablo> I dont think you will have to reboot just nameserver 4.2.2.1
[07:26] <rBlong2us> Jordan_U: I got this putter working with Vesa, no DRI for while
[07:26] <genbie> ok pablo
[07:26] <abes> genbie: just restart the network... should work
[07:26] <Jordan_U> santeria[FL] : Dapper, no opinion on 64, but any open source drivers ( see most of them ) will support 64 bit.
[07:26] <santeria[FL] > ok
[07:26] <santeria[FL] > i think ill just go with 32 just to be safe
[07:26] <abes> genbie: /etc/init.d/networking restart
[07:27] <boni> can anyone tell me how to check if your bluetooth is on on Dapper
[07:27] <abes> genbie: after you're done
[07:28] <genbie> ok abes thankz
[07:28] <abes> genbie: no problem
[07:28] <abes> genbie: come back and let me know if it helped...
[07:28] <river> How can I copy the /home/ and all subdirectories of a partion that wont boot but I have mounted, to a USB flash drive for backup so I can blow everything away and install fresh ?
[07:29] <abes> can anyone tell me why would wi-fi stop working RANDOMLY? no changes were made whatsoever... instead of all wi-fi nets it was showing now it just says "Wired network connection"???
[07:29] <Jordan_U> tich_: Blame the ambiguity of the English language! I think the wiki means that the 386 will break x , not the generic :)
[07:29] <boni> can anyone tell me how to check if my blutooth is on or not on Dapper???
[07:30] <tich_> Jordan_U, huh. well i guess it is good that it didn't install.
[07:30] <Jordan_U> tich_: So uninstall the 386, install the generic, install the restricted modules, then install the nvidea drivers, in that order.
[07:30] <abes> boni: have you checked http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24546 ??
[07:30] <tich_> Jordan_U, how do i remove the 386, is it the linux-restricted-modules?
[07:31] <abes> river: cp -rf /home DESTINATION_PATH should do
[07:33] <collin> i have i486-linux-gnu-cpp-4.1 in my usr/bin and usr/bin is part of my path, yet when I try to compile with g++ it says that g++ command not found?

[07:33] <genbie> pablo thaanks a lot
[07:34] <genbie> abes i just had a number of errors on eth and wlan when restarting the network
[07:34] <genbie> because i am using an old computer i think ;-)
[07:35] <genbie> i have now added 4.2.2.2 as well
[07:35] <genbie> thanks abes
[07:35] <genbie> bye
[07:35] <river> abes, do I need sudo so as to get access to user sub dirs ? is athere any thing else I should copy ?
[07:35] <Pablo> sure genbie
[07:36] <genbie> pablo i have to have both 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 right?
[07:36] <abes> river: sudo would be a good idea since some files have just rwx------ perms
[07:36] <Pablo> no you can have one or 2
[07:36] <abes> river: well... personal data is pretty much /home
[07:36] <Pablo> the second is just a backup
[07:36] <genbie> pablo strange that i was using other dns servers all these years without problem until now
[07:36] <Pablo> well
[07:36] <genbie> oh ok pablo
[07:37] <Pablo> those have been up for about 12 years
[07:37] <Pablo> :P
[07:37] <genbie> ah ok
[07:37] <abes> genbie: see... cuz those servers wern't on ubuntu so they had to chrash one day or another :P
[07:37] <genbie> ;-)
[07:37] <abes> yeah 12 years is a nice uptime :p
[07:37] <Pablo> say thanks to Level 3 Communications, Inc.
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[07:37] <genbie> lol
[07:38] <abes> if I slept through half of my live average then i have around 12 years uptime too :P
[07:38] <genbie> bye
[07:38] <abes> cya
[07:38] <Za1> Hi - I have s-video connection from my laptop to my projector and I would like to project to it.  Any idea what I should be doing? should I be tweaking to the xorg.conf file?  I have "ATI Technologies, Inc. Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 9000] " device running on Dell Inspiron 5100 laptop.
[07:38] <Pablo> and it was mci's dns before that
[07:38] <sanityx> Hey guys, I've booted off an Ubuntu 6.10 disc but X fails. Is there a way I can start a textual install from the console?
[07:39] <sanityx> (I'm using console based IRC right now)
[07:39] <Za1> be really thankful if someone help me about this...
[07:39] <Jordan_U> sanityx: Not that I know of, you can download and install from the alternate, text mode CD.
[07:39] <santeria[FL] > yay dappers almost done
[07:39] <tich_> Jordan_U, you were so right, that seems to have worked. i am going to check my xorg.conf right now.
[07:40] <Jordan_U> tich_: :)
[07:40] <sanityx> Jordan_U: bah!
[07:40] <Daehlie> the xchat-gnome in edgy is buggy as hell, someone fix that one of these days =P
[07:40] <Olathe> How do I set Swiftfox, rather than w3m, to be the default browser used by other applications ?
[07:40] <Jordan_U> sanityx: BUT, we can try to get your graphics working in the liveCD.
[07:40] <sanityx> Has anybody experienced X failing when booting ubuntu 6.10 on powerpc?
[07:40] <river> abes, what about /usr/ ?
[07:41] <sanityx> Jordan_U: Well it says no screen found. Ideas?
[07:41] <Jordan_U> sanityx: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[07:41] <chi0> can any one help me w/ my ati install
[07:42] <Jordan_U> sanityx: (my solution to everything )
[07:42] <sanityx> i tried that without the flags. ill try it with them
[07:42] <Jordan_U> sanityx: It just tells dpkg not to ask as many questions.
[07:43] <sanityx> Jordan_U: Fatal Server Error: No Screens Found
[07:43] <joeny> hello
[07:43] <joeny> exit
[07:44] <Jordan_U> sanityx: When you did the full dpkg-reconfigure, did you do what it says you might have to on PPC? ( I remember notes like that when I did it on my PPC machine )
[07:44] <chi0> please any one i need help :(
[07:44] <river> I have a sub flash and have a icon on the desk and see the contents...how do I know the path to this to use in a cp command ?
[07:44] <sanityx> might have to do?
[07:44] <sanityx> i didnt notice it saying anything. ill look again
[07:45] <Jordan_U> sanityx: It said PPC, I never really paid attention to it thogh.
[07:45] <river> alternatively does someone know how to run the file manager in sudo mode ?
[07:45] <Jordan_U> river: sudo nautilus
[07:45] <sanityx> nah doesnt say anything
[07:45] <Vuen> river: gksudo nautilus
[07:46] <Jordan_U> sanityx: Withought the -phigh ?
[07:46] <iami89> how do i install openGL?
[07:46] <Jordan_U> iami89: It should be installed by default.
[07:47] <sanityx> oh yeah it does say something like halfway through. ill tell you what it says. i remember not knowing how to do it though
[07:47] <Vuen> iami89: opengl comes with video card drivers. what video card do you have?
[07:47] <Za1> has anyone use projector via s-video before?
[07:48] <chi0> can any one help me w/ my ati card install
[07:48] <sanityx> i have to put in the bus location. lets see if lcpci gives it to me
[07:49] <muzik> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30715/
[07:49] <Za1> chi0: i think there is no experty about xconf in this room.  I am having same prob too
[07:49] <Jordan_U> sanityx: Is it the comment about Busid ( I ran reconfigure on my intel machine )
[07:49] <muzik> does anybody know how my grub configure should look like with this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30715/
[07:49] <chi0> that sucks
[07:49] <muzik> chi0, atis suck, i know, i got one to :(
[07:50] <rc-1> strange, none of the buttons are working after i installed konversation (updates, system quit, etc)
[07:50] <iami89> my card is ATI RADEON 7000 series
[07:50] <muzik> i got a stupid x1600
[07:50] <Za1> I thought Ubuntu support was good.
[07:50] <iami89> where to get OpenGL in opengl.com?
[07:50] <chi0> I have a built in ati card b\c it cam w/ my note book :(
[07:50] <iami89> opengl.org
[07:51] <Jewfro-Macabbi> I was adding an aplet to my gnome panel, on now the panel is locked, can't access anything. Is there a config file I can wipe out to reset defaults?
[07:51] <rc-1> NO programs, including terminal will start! help
[07:53] <sanityx> Jordan_U: no luck man
[07:53] <Jordan_U> rc-1: Can you start ( non GUI of course ) applications from a tty ( press ctrl+alt+F2 )?
[07:53] <Vuen> rc-1: press alt+f7 to get back
[07:53] <Jordan_U> sanityx: What kind of mac is it, or is it not a mac?
[07:54] <Vuen> you can't send people to a tty without telling them how to get back :p
[07:54] <Vuen> he just hard rebooted
[07:54] <sanityx> its a mac
[07:54] <Jordan_U> Vuen: Sorry, I should know better, sombody did that to me when I was new :(
[07:54] <sanityx> dual 500Mhz PowerMac, so i guess that would make it a G3
[07:55] <sanityx> ati card
[07:55] <sanityx> worked fine with 6.06
[07:55] <Vuen> hehe, yeah, someone did the same to me when i was new too :p
[07:55] <Jordan_U> sanityx: Do you still have the xorg.conf from dapper?
[07:55] <genbie> hi again abes and pablo.. after i rebooted, the contents of e/tc/resolv.comf and /etc/ppp/resolv.conf reverted to the old namerserver ip! how can i change it to 4.2.2.1 permamnetly plz?
[07:56] <sanityx> Jordan_U: I was thinking about that but I can't seem to get the hard drives mounted
[07:56] <chi0> alot of stuff worked in 6.06 but the kernal is jacked lol
[07:56] <Jordan_U> Vuen: I am probably going to sleep soon, please give my apologies if he comes back.
[07:56] <sanityx> Do I have to do something special to mount drives on a mac?
[07:56] <Vuen> sure
[07:56] <chi0> now you have to hak shitt to get it working
[07:56] <sanityx> Jordan_U: cfdisk reads the disks fine but they wont mount
[07:56] <sanityx> mount -t auto /dev/hdb3 /media/
[07:57] <sanityx> oops
[07:57] <sanityx> wrong window
[07:57] <Jordan_U> sanityx: I never had any problems.
[07:57] <astro> hello
[07:57] <chi0> have you had probs w/ DHCP?
[07:57] <chi0> any 1
[07:57] <zero742> is there a forum for beryl specifically?
[07:57] <Jordan_U> zero742: #beryl
[07:57] <zero742> thanks
[07:57] <Jordan_U> np
[07:57] <zero742> ....kinda obvious I guess
[07:58] <zero742> hehe
[07:58] <Jordan_U> zero742: #ubuntu-xgl also
[07:58] <astro> so I was here last night, getting some help with getting my wireless running.. anyone avaliable to help me a bit more? i couldn't get it last night, ive done a few things but I cant figure out whats wrong.
[07:59] <Jordan_U> sanityx: What is the command you used?  from the right window :)
[07:59] <river> I have 3 machines on home network via wireless, would someone comment if it is practicle to consider having a common home ofor all machines/users on a 4th machine ? and if so, how ?
[08:00] <dungodung> so, I have converted 2 partitions from ntfs to fat32 and edited /etc/fstab (changed ntfs into vfat), but when I restart, the partitions aren't mounted. what gives?
[08:01] <sanityx> Jordan_U: mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb[1,2,3 etc]  /media/
[08:01] <Vuen> river: you could have one machine be the server and set up the other three machines as thin clients. heh.
[08:01] <Jordan_U> sanityx: You sure it is hdb and not hda ?
[08:01] <sanityx> Jordan_U: wait i might have just got it
[08:01] <sanityx> Jordan_U: yes, OSX is on hda
[08:01] <Vuen> river: really though, the easiest way is just to set up some writeable samba shares on the 4th computer
[08:01] <astro> basically my machine is recognizing my wireless card but im not able to search/find my wireless network, even when entering the SSID, etc.
[08:01] <sanityx> Jordan_U: I just got it mounted
[08:01] <sanityx> silly me
[08:01] <Jordan_U> sanityx: And you are mounting it directly to /media
[08:02] <sanityx> Jordan_U: Yeah, thats fine for now.
[08:02] <river> Vuen, and would this be workable over a wireless which is a little flaky or slow at times ?
[08:02] <chris86wm> how to you install the ogg/theora plugin in totem?
[08:02] <rc-1> do i have to dist-upgrade after installing nvida drivers/before installing beryl?
[08:02] <Vuen> river: yep. it would work very well. samba's quite good at resuming connections, much better than windows' implementation
[08:03] <sanityx> Jordan_U: of course x still failed to start . . .
[08:03] <Vuen> river: four of my roommates have windows xp, and two of us have ubuntu. three of us are on wireless. we all share files using windows file sharing / samba, and it's works flawlessly
[08:03] <Vuen> /it's/it
[08:03] <Jordan_U> sanityx: That makes sence with xorg 7 being so different I guess, but maybe you can find the correct busID.
[08:04] <river> Vuen, when a given machine is booting up and the wireless is down, what happens ?
[08:04] <dungodung> so, can anyone please help me with my mounting problem?
[08:04] <Vuen> river: you mean when the AP is down? hmm, not sure. you can configure how linux behaves in these cases, though i'm not really sure how
[08:05] <santeria[FL] > ok on dapper when i put it in it went to the splash screen, then after loading, it went to that vertical line screen but i heard what sounded like a start up little jingle
[08:05] <Vuen> in KDE i have a "Wireless LAN Manager" program with some settings in it, it's probably in gnome as well
[08:05] <sanityx> Jordan_U: lspci -x|grep ati shows 0001:11:02.0
[08:05] <astro> anyone?
[08:05] <santeria[FL] > so i did ctrl alt f2 and put in those nvidia commands
[08:05] <santeria[FL] > and it didnt crash
[08:05] <santeria[FL] > but it said it couldnt find the 3rd line
[08:05] <santeria[FL] > i think
[08:05] <river> Vuen, and is it likely to slow a session down if wireless is a little slow e.g. when application create temporary files or the like ? or when saving files
[08:05] <chris86wm> totem wont play ogg or theora files. is there anyway to fix this?
[08:06] <chris86wm> says "there is no plugin to handle this movie"
[08:06] <Vuen> river: well sure, i mean there's going to be some delays if you're moving gigantic files (movies, etc). but for saving files like word documents it will be totally transparent
[08:06] <river> dungodunug, if you describe your problem or a ask a more direct question, you are likely for someone to help
[08:07] <Vuen> dungodung: pastebin.ca your fstab
[08:07] <river> Vuen, thanks for your comments...and time...so how does one point all machines and users to the same home ? some trick in /etc/fstab on all machines or some symbolic link trick ?
[08:08] <chris86wm> anyone ?
[08:08] <AsheD> if I were to buy a video game in Italy, would it differ from the same game if purchased in the UK ?
[08:09] <santeria[FL] > i just remembered on the splash screen an option was vga could i do anytihing in that menu that wouldnt give me the line problem
[08:09] <Vuen> river: i actually have no idea how to mount home on a remote drive :(. mounting samba shares as arbitrary folders is easy, but home folders need to be mounted before you log in, so i don't really know.
[08:10] <Vuen> river: you may need to post on the forums to explain in detail what you want. also, if you don't have any windows machines, you'll probably want to use something other than samba
[08:10] <Vuen> AsheD: depends on the game.
[08:10] <dungodung> Vuen: I'm not home right now
[08:10] <AsheD> Vuen:: how about Unreal Anthology ?
[08:10] <santeria[FL] > anyone have any ideas? i thought dapper would work =\
[08:10] <Vuen> dungodung: oh. well, it's a bit difficult to help you if you don't have access to your computer >.<
[08:10] <astro> i need help getting my wireless working :(
[08:11] <Vuen> AsheD: mm, don't know. you'd have to search online for that
[08:11] <river> Vuen, yes all ubuntu boxes :-) how's that getting all the kids learning early :-)
[08:11] <AsheD> Vuen:: I have been, I was looking for some personal testimonies as well
[08:11] <dungodung> vuen: I can basically remember what settings I had
[08:11] <Vuen> river: that's great :)
[08:12] <ecko> is there any way to get Thunderbird to minimize to the tray like Gaim does in ubuntu?
[08:12] <santeria[FL] > =( dapper drake doesnt work it keeps having thouse vertical lines :(
[08:12] <astro> Vuen: do you know alot about getting wireless working in ubuntu?
[08:12] <sanityx> Bah.
[08:12] <Vuen> astro: no, sorry :(. i have an atheros wireless card, and madwifi is built natively in the kernel so i've never needed ndiswrapper
[08:13] <Vuen> so i don't know how to set it up :(
[08:13] <astro> damn :/
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[08:13] <astro> i have a POS built in one
[08:13] <astro> that wont seem to fuckin work no matter what i do
[08:13] <Vuen> astro: google the model of your wireless card with the word "ndiswrapper"
[08:13] <astro> i did
[08:13] <astro> and followed the directions there as well
[08:13] <astro> no dice
[08:13] <santeria[FL] > does anyone know how to fix my problem where when ever i try to boot ubuntu from the livecd it shows these colored verticle lines?
[08:13] <astro> i think possibly im doing something wrong, though
[08:15] <astro> brb
[08:15] <astro> Vuen, how do i get the exact model of my card
[08:15] <astro> i forgot how to do that
[08:16] <Vuen> rc-1: Jordan_U apologizes for sending you to a virtual terminal without telling you how to get back. When you press ctrl+alt+f2, to get back press alt+f7
[08:17] <Vuen> astro: in linux, i don't know. if you have windows dual-booted, you can just check there.
[08:17] <rc-1> Vuen: thanks :) a restart fixed and OMFG BERYL IS SO AWESOME
[08:17] <Vuen> hehe, yep
[08:17] <harmental> i've upgraded to edgy and since then i cant create folders with french characters ( )
[08:17] <harmental> any ideas?
[08:17] <Vuen> if you're running beryl, it's best not to go to virtual terminals
[08:18] <harmental> je viens de faire un upgrade  edgy et je ne peut plus creer de dossiers avec de lettre du genre    ....
[08:18] <Vuen> because beryl has a bug where it sometimes hardlocks x when you try to get back to tty7
[08:18] <KenSentMe> !fr | harmental
[08:18] <ubotu> harmental: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:18] <rc-1> just installed it now, and wow
[08:18] <Vuen> so don't press ctrl+alt+f# while beryl is running
[08:18] <splintax> "Make sure the hostnames for your Windows and Linux partitons are different!"
[08:18] <splintax> hostname = "computer name" in windows, right?
[08:18] <splintax> how do i change my host name :/
[08:18] <harmental> KenSentMe: i know sorry i clicked on the wrong channel......
[08:18] <defrysk> harmental, you know how to work with dead keys ?
[08:18] <KenSentMe> harmental: no problem
[08:19] <splintax> nevermind, worked it out.
[08:19] <elbonzi> Hey all, any experts want to tell me why ndiswrapper freezes my computer?
[08:19] <harmental> my question stands however.....
[08:19] <harmental> defrysk: what?
[08:19] <Jordan_U> rc-1: I had somebody do the same thing to me when I was new and I had to unplug the machine, I should have known better.
[08:19] <MrPoopyPants> elbonzi, because ndiswrapper is generaly crap
[08:19] <defrysk> harmental, us_intl
[08:19] <defrysk> you know the term ?
[08:19] <elbonzi> Mrpoopypants, how do i use my wireless card on edgy without it?
[08:20] <astro> crapola.
[08:20] <FuelB> libgl1-mesa-dev has broken dependencies in edgy
[08:20] <harmental> defrysk: could u be more specific
[08:20] <harmental> ?
[08:20] <MrPoopyPants> elbonzi, you've got the heck out of me, I dont even bother with wireless in linux
[08:20] <MrPoopyPants> after the debacle with ndiswrapper I dont even try
[08:20] <defrysk> harmental, hut a key , then space to get the result like 
[08:21] <astro> broadcom 4318
[08:21] <astro> hmm
[08:21] <defrysk> harmental, I guess you do not
[08:22] <iamlindoro> Hi all-- I have installed the openssh-server package on my ubuntu machine, but my attempt to connect to it still time out... is there a config file I am missing or something I am doing wrong?
[08:22] <rc-1> one gripe though, konversation the connect menu wont go away
[08:22] <defrysk>  
[08:22] <KenSentMe> iamlindoro: here it works out of the box, no config needed
[08:23] <KenSentMe> iamlindoro: are you sure you use the right ip?
[08:23] <iamlindoro> yep, and it pings just fine... just not ssh
[08:23] <harmental> defrysk: not following you.....i can type special characters....i can even see them in already created folders......but this error pops up when i try to copy or create a new folder with them....
[08:23] <harmental> im using a french keyboard anyways
[08:24] <MrPoopyPants> does it have a lot of meaty pastes made with internal organs?
[08:24] <Arepie> is there any program that could generate my computer .vmx file automaticaly ?
[08:24] <MrPoopyPants> I couldnt believe how many gutpastes they call food over there
[08:24] <iamlindoro> ifconfig on the ubuntu box shows eth0 with an ip of 192.168.1.99, and I try to ssh -l *loginname* 192.168.1.99 from another box on the same network and it times out
[08:24] <harmental> and it happens only when i try to do that on external drives....
[08:24] <defrysk> harmental, not sure about that prob but it sounds like a utf8 related prob
[08:25] <harmental> yes....i agree....but don know how to resolve it....is there any way to force ISO8859 when mounting external drives (automatically)?
[08:25] <defrysk> harmental, add nls=utf8 to the drives concerned
[08:26] <harmental> shouldnt i avoid UTF??
[08:26] <defrysk> harmental, in fstab in the options section
[08:26] <defrysk> harmental, no you should use it
=== pc3 is now known as hendro^_^
=== foolswisdom is now known as fool|Zzz
=== hendro^_^ is now known as edo^_^
[08:26] <harmental> the problem is that im sharing files with a windows box....
[08:26] <MM2> GRRR, I'm getting pissed off with dist-upgrading. I never get it working right :(
[08:27] <defrysk> harmental, UTF8 IS THE WAY TO GO , JUST TRY IT
[08:27] <defrysk> oops caps sorry
[08:27] <harmental> defrysk: so how can i set external drives....?
[08:27] <MM2> gksu "update-manager -c" asks password for ROOT, apt-get dist-upgrade x2 won't start upgrade (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/releasenotes/610)
[08:28] <harmental> i thought fstab was for interan drives only...
[08:28] <Vuen> MM2: gksudo, not gksu
[08:28] <defrysk> harmental how do you mount them when you want to use one ?
[08:28] <MM2> Vuen: docs says so... look at url
[08:28] <Arepie> !vmx
[08:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vmx - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:28] <Arepie> !vmware
[08:28] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository. Instructions to install VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[08:28] <Vuen> MM2: try it with gksudo.
[08:29] <harmental> defrysk: ok...so what lines should i add??
[08:29] <defrysk> nls=utf8
[08:29] <defrysk> as an option when you mount it
[08:29] <Vuen> MM2: gksu asks for the root password, while gksudo asks you for your own password. unless you want to actually set a root password and activate the root account, gksu will never work. i really don't know why they put gksu there instead of gksudo
[08:30] <defrysk> harmental, if its fat32 its just utf8
[08:30] <harmental> defrysk: they are automatically mounted.....
[08:30] <defrysk> harmental, is it fat32 or ntfs ?
[08:30] <harmental> ive tried ticking the utf option ...but the result was the same....
[08:31] <MM2> Vuen: gksudo won't start update-manager :(
[08:31] <harmental> fat32
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: that's really strange...
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: okay, well the reason apt-get isn't doing it is because you're probably still set on the dapper repos
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: s/dapper/edgy/g
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: :wq
[08:31] <Vuen> MM2: sudo apt-get update
[08:31] <Vuen> then you can dist-upgrade twice.
[08:32] <defrysk> harmental, its an utf8 issue if the drive is mentioned in fstab add utf8 in the options section and restart fstab then with sudo mount -a
[08:33] <defrysk> harmental, if that does not work I do not know
[08:33] <harmental> wait!...my external drive is not on the fstab....
[08:33] <MM2> Vuen: *sigh* there is breezy on repos... Maybe I should upgrade it first :P
[08:33] <defrysk> harmental, usb drive ?
[08:33] <harmental> yes
[08:34] <Vuen> MM2: oh. yeah, you can't go from breezy to dapper
[08:34] <Vuen> err, you can't go from breezy to edgy
[08:34] <defrysk> harmental, sorry not sure how to fix that
[08:34] <Vuen> you have to breezy->dapper->edgy
[08:34] <MM2> Vuen: ty, sorry for troubles... I must then read how to upgrade breezy :/
[08:34] <Vuen> MM2: same thing, only in the sources.list, do s/breezy/dapper/g
[08:35] <Vuen> MM2: honestly though your system will probably be more stable if you just install edgy from scratch
[08:35] <Vuen> i had a lot of problems upgrading from breezy to dapper, and a lot of people had problems upgrading from dapper to edgy
[08:36] <Vuen> especially if you've used tools like automatix, things are pretty much guaranteed to break
[08:36] <apomb> anyone around?
[08:36] <Vuen> edgy is a fantastic release, especially when you get things like Beryl working. it's worth it to do it clean.
[08:36] <Vuen> apomb: yep
[08:36] <MM2> Vuen: I think that too, I haven't use this comps Ubuntu much, because USB kbd and mouse won't work an breezy
[08:36] <Vuen> wow, that sucks
[08:36] <kholerabbit> is edgy metacity compiled for 3d? (see: http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/notes/en/rnfrontpage.html)
[08:36] <Vuen> do they work in the edgy livecd?
[08:37] <apomb> i need help ... my CD/DVD R/W is not being detected :(
[08:37] <MM2> Vuen: I have not testet, I'll burn install CD and install and try
[08:37] <Vuen> MM2: they will probably work in edgy. download the edgy cd, burn it and boot from it to see if your keyboard and mouse work
[08:37] <Vuen> you don't need to install it to test it
[08:37] <MM2> Vuen: usb kbd and mouse works, if I plug in ps/2 mouse and kbd before boot
[08:37] <Vuen> since dapper, the install cd and the livecd have been combined into one
[08:38] <Vuen> MM2: i have a usb mouse and no ps/2 mouse, and it works fine in dapper and edgy. i'm using it right now.
[08:38] <Vuen> download the desktop cd for edgy and try it out
[08:38] <apomb> my dmesg doesnt even say any ATAPI devices are being loaded
[08:38] <MM2> Vuen: This is HP computer :P
[08:39] <Vuen> if you have a lot of stuff configured in dapper, you can easily backup all your config files: tar -cvzf etc.tar /etc/*
[08:41] <apomb> i just did a fresh install of edgy, and it seems to have disabled ATA support :S
[08:44] <youser> hey can i get xmms to play wmas?
[08:44] <apomb> install the win32codecs
[08:44] <youser> i have
[08:44] <Staz> Hi, what would you guys recommend for sfv checking/creating?
[08:45] <rc-1> just installed beryl :) how do i show the cube, and flip it
[08:45] <apomb> hmmm ... im not very familiar with xmms, sorry youser
[08:45] <Vuen> rc-1: ctrl+alt+left/right
[08:45] <Vuen> or ctrl+alt+leftclickdrag
[08:45] <Cas> Staz: cksfv
[08:45] <youser> thanks anyways
[08:45] <Staz> thanks Cas :)
[08:46] <youser> anyone good with audacity?
[08:46] <apomb> so ... no one knows how to get edgy to detect a CD/DVD R/RW drive?
[08:47] <rc-1> control alt left/right doenst work
[08:47] <Vuen> rc-1: open beryl settings manager, and make sure the Desktop Cube and Cube Rotate plugins are checked
[08:47] <rc-1> k brb
[08:48] <rc-1> yes they are
[08:48] <Vuen> hmm
[08:48] <DarkED> so, how is Edgy?
[08:48] <rc-1> also, it only shows one desktop on lower right
[08:48] <Vuen> and your windows are wobbly?
[08:48] <Vuen> rc-1: are you using kde?
[08:48] <rc-1> yeah its definently on :) and nope just gnome
[08:48] <Vuen> that's really strange.
[08:48] <Vuen> try asking in #beryl
[08:48] <Cas> apomb: what do you mean by "detect"? It's no windows. Check you dmesg if you can find your drive
[08:49] <rc-1> if i click on where the windows should be (on bottom right ) it does rotate tho
[08:49] <Vuen> oh
[08:49] <Vuen> then maybe the keys are just set up wrong
[08:49] <apomb> Cas, dmesg does not find it
[08:49] <Staz> Any faster checkers than cksfv? :) Taking its time.
[08:49] <astro> sigh
[08:49] <Cas> apomb: also, don't you have a /dev/hdx
[08:49] <Vuen> rc-1: try dragging a window over to the border of the screen. does it rotate
[08:49] <Vuen> ?
[08:49] <apomb> yes, its /dev/hda
[08:49] <rc-1> Vuen: yup :)
[08:50] <astro> now my wireless card is not visible in system>admin>networking
[08:50] <Vuen> then the key settings are probably just wrong. you can set up what keys you want to rotate the cube under the Rotate Cube plugin
[08:50] <Cas> apomb: I'm sure there is ATA support in edgy, so it must be a bug or your hardware is broken
[08:50] <apomb> the error is: mount: special device /dev/hdc does not exist
[08:50] <rc-1> ok, thanks
[08:51] <Cas> apomb: what about: hal-device | grep cdrom
[08:51] <DarkED> a question: why cant I pull the channel list on freenode?
[08:51] <apomb> Cas, nothing happens :/
[08:51] <rc-1> says they are ctrl alt right/left
[08:51] <Vuen> hmm. then i'm not sure
[08:52] <Vuen> ask in #beryl or #beryl-dev
[08:52] <astro> i cant figure this out at all :(
[08:52] <Cas> apomb: check if your hardware works (bootcd/windows) and file a bug on launchpad otherwise
[08:53] <apomb> i'll check the connection of the cables... again.
[08:53] <apomb> before i updated, i was able to write, read (obviously) and everything....
[08:54] <apomb> thanks anyway Cas
[08:54] <Cas> apomb: good luck
[08:54] <apomb> thanks
[08:55] <apomb> ima try a reboot

[08:57] <sF|Xemanth> i have a problem, i have 350 mhz k6-2 comp, which has ram 256+32, should i chooce ubuntu or xubuntu for it

[08:58] <sF|Xemanth> i have atm xubuntu dapper in it, i'm planning to update it to edgy, but its go* da*n slow
[08:58] <NewcomerXb> I dont get help in the forum either. I must ask bizarre question :<

=== inu|sleep is now known as inuyasharenegade
[09:00] <NewcomerXb> well. i guess i may as well head out. No one knows how to use fsck?
[09:01] <vintle> hey all
[09:01] <tonyyarusso> NewcomerXb: Sorry, I'm on my way to bed (3AM), but you can read up on the man page if nobody answers soon; I don't know how it works internally, but it looks for some sort of markers about the file system to see if everything is as it should be, and tries to fix it if not.
[09:01] <splintax> i have a problem: i'm now trying to run VMWare in ubuntu, and use it to boot up my windows partition within ubuntu. but as i'm configuring the virtual machine, when i go to specify the disk/partition to boot this VM from, i get "Failed to load partitions for device /dev/sda: Permission denied"

[09:02] <astro> im having a very hard time here i dont know what else to do :/
[09:02] <cew> hai ;)
[09:03] <vintle> umm i dont know much about vmware but did you enable root?
[09:03] <astro> any know any way to help me get wireless setup here on my laptop
[09:03] <splintax> vintle: what do you mean? am i running vmware as root?
[09:03] <tonyyarusso> astro: Have you seen the online docs yet?
[09:03] <astro> yes
[09:04] <jordo2323> I am trying to install Nvidia drivers and it says to kill xwindows.....how?
[09:04] <astro> i googled the wireless card ubuntu and ndiswrapper too
[09:04] <astro> didn't work
[09:04] <tonyyarusso> astro: If none of that sheds any light, maybe try the mailing list.  More eyes will see ie.
[09:04] <astro> :(
[09:04] <vintle> splintax: If permission was denied maybe if you tried to run it as root
[09:04] <astro> the thing im having a problem with now is that I did the steps, but not my wireless card is not under Networks
[09:04] <astro> er Network
[09:05] <astro> i have the wired one and the modem,  but the wireless has vanished
[09:05] <splintax> vintle: okay, i'll try that. how do i edit the launchers in the Applications menu?
[09:05] <jordo2323> Anyone know how to boot Ubuntu into a command line and not into xwindows?
[09:05] <tonyyarusso> jordo2323: Once, or all the time?
[09:05] <jordo2323> tony: just once to install my nvidia drivers
[09:05] <vintle> That Im not sure of but I know when there is a permission denied error it may be because the user acct your using isnt privileged enough.
[09:05] <splintax> jordo2323: sudo init 1 will drop you into the command line
[09:06] <astro> tonyyarusso: would you know how to get my wireless card back into the Networks portion under administration?
[09:06] <splintax> vintle: yes but i'd like to run vmware while logged into my normal account. so i'll probably need to edit the launcher to run as superuser.
[09:06] <vintle> yup
[09:06] <tonyyarusso> jordo2323: You could use the "recovery mode" from grub, which will give you a root command prompt.
[09:06] <vintle> Nvidia guy have you tried using automatix?
[09:06] <jordo2323> I'll try.....brb
[09:07] <tonyyarusso> astro: My wireless worked ootb, so no.
[09:07] <splintax> vintle: what IRC client are you using? it may be useful to get one with tab autocompletion so that you can prefix messages with people's names.
[09:07] <astro> :(
[09:07] <splintax> vintle: that way they're more likely to see what you're saying.
[09:07] <vintle> YEa right now im usung xchat and im new to it ...
[09:08] <splintax> vintle: I'm using Xchat as well. Just start typing someone's name and hit Tab, it should complete the name for you then you can type the rest of your message.
[09:08] <splintax> vintle: see how it highlights messages when i prefix them with your name?

[09:31] <mikeymike-linux_> can ANYONE tell me how to restart it remotely

[09:45] <Arepie> and perhaps.. i've read wiki and google..
[09:46] <mzli> <Arepie> qume also can do it.
[09:47] <jokoon> ubotu what is a gimp ?

[09:49] <mzli>  qemu-img create xp.img 5G
[09:49] <mzli> qemu -hda xp.img -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d
[09:49] <MM2> Darn, edgys liveCD did not regocnized my usb kbd or mouse, and lang setting are all wrong
[09:49] <mzli> qemu -hda xp.img

[09:50] <mzli> Arepie>just this 3 orders.
[09:50] <MM2> so if I Install it, will my usb kbd or mouse work
[09:50] <jokoon> How can I restore my cherokee perms with gnu vino instead of forwarding ssh throught synaptic, can't /dev/gnu just work with it ?
[09:50] <Burgundavia> olopez: not certain. I would check launchpad

[09:59] <jc-denton> i don't really have to an idea how to build it
[09:59] <dorto> olopez, cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep edgy | head -n 1
[09:59] <dorto> substitue edgy with dapper etc if that is what you want
[10:00] <jc-denton> but according to the kernel documentation make -C <path-to-kernel> M=`pwd` should be enough
[10:00] <olopez> ok dorto y do finally cat /etc/issue ;)
[10:00] <jokoon> I have some icon and it appears to be in 32bits, and I want to convert it in 24bits keeping the alpha channels, is it -possible- ? (... to do with gimp for example)
[10:00] <jc-denton> can i use the kernel-headers as <path-to-kernel> ?
[10:00] <jokoon> Or 16bits
[10:01] <dorto> never heard about /etc/issue
[10:01] <olopez> Burgundavia: It wasn't like bug , i submit it
[10:02] <jc-denton> but that's what i get
[10:02] <jc-denton> make: *** arch/i386/boot: No such file or directory.  Stop.
[10:02] <olopez> dorto:  issue - pre-login message and identification file ;)
[10:04] <Anev> ;;
[10:04] <noelvis> Anyone?
[10:04] <jc-denton> maybe i need to ask different

[10:08] <g1gaman> gentlemen, can anybody help me to set keyboard shortcuts in ubuntu (e.g. open nautilus with winkey+E)
[10:09] <delari> are you using a windows keyboard
[10:09] <lance_> aldin, You mean Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP?
[10:09] <jc-denton> jordo2323: you mean reboot? no
[10:10] <jordo2323> jc-denton: Yeah....didn't think so.....any ideas?
[10:10] <jc-denton> no it's supposed to work now
[10:10] <jc-denton> java apps work w/o problemes for me on edgy
[10:10] <jordo2323> I get an error message when running from command line......can I pastebin to you?
[10:10] <dorto> aldin, you can download and install them over internet from Synaptic package manager
[10:10] <dorto> instead of downloading a CD
[10:11] <dorto> or get Ubuntu Server
[10:11] <zerosmoke> finally got my motorola wireless pc card working on edgy
[10:11] <aldin> is this joke msfirefox.com
[10:11] <dorto> aldin, yes, joke, what else?

[10:12] <mikeymike-linux_> why is my vino-server man pages messed up? and how do i fix it?
[10:12] <msfirefox> its quite a hoot
[10:12] <jc-denton> looks like an swt problem
[10:12] <g1gaman> gentlemen, can anybody help me to set keyboard shortcuts in ubuntu (e.g. open nautilus with winkey+E)
[10:12] <jc-denton> sry i really don't know
[10:13] <g1gaman> sorry for abuse
[10:13] <msfirefox-com> g1gaman: have you checked google?
[10:13] <msfirefox-com> theres heaps of tutorials
[10:13] <jordo2323> Does anyone here run Nvidia GPU's under ubuntu?
[10:13] <Cromag> windows keys and capslock doesnt should not be on a keyboard.
[10:13] <g1gaman> msfirefox-com: yes, but i cant get the helpful result
[10:13] <Daverocks> jordo2323: yeah
[10:14] <g1gaman> Cromag: so, what is your shortcut to home folder?
[10:14] <SilentDis> hello :)
[10:14] <jordo2323> Daverocks: Is there a driver management menu like in windows if I installed the driver?
[10:15] <Daverocks> jordo2323: there's "nvidia-settings" which is similar to the one in the windows nvidia drivers, but i don't think it's particularly helpful
[10:15] <jordo2323> How do I control the cards outputs then?
[10:15] <msfirefox-com> tell me,
[10:15] <msfirefox-com> are there any beginners using Ubuntu
[10:15] <g1gaman> Cromag: and capslock is very helpful in editing text, when titles should be uppercase
[10:15] <jordo2323> I have my 6800 hooked into my TV through Svideo...
[10:16] <msfirefox-com> no idea of linux whatsoever etc
[10:16] <g1gaman> msfirefox-com: consider me as one
[10:16] <Daverocks> jordo2323: nvidia-settings is probably your best bet for effects and ways to display etc, but if it concerns multiple displays and display control, then that's just X configuration
[10:17] <Cromag> capslock should go away. Shift button is there.
[10:17] <SilentDis> not truely a tech support question... more of a search for a tool to help me.  I am looking for a tool that allows me to batch convert a number of audio files through lame, hopefully reading out the mp3 tags first, and passing them to the new file.  anyone herd of such a tool?  (not grip, it seems to just work if it's coming from CD audio, unless I'm missing something)

[10:19] <jordo2323> If I just installed Ubuntu to a blank system, how can I partition the rest of my hard drive for windows?
[10:19] <Cromag> g1gaman: yes ?
[10:19] <msfirefox-com> jordo2323: click 'Next'
[10:19] <SilentDis> jordo2323:  you have unpartitioned space?
[10:19] <Daverocks> jordo2323: it's easiest to install windows first
[10:20] <SilentDis> jordo2323: i agree with Daverocks.  but, having said that, it's not impossible.
[10:20] <g1gaman> Cromag: you found that style smart?
[10:21] <Cromag> for me yes
[10:21] <jordo2323> Daverocks: When I install Windows first do I partition the linux part there or in Ubuntu's installer?
[10:22] <zerosmoke> why not just switch all the way over to linux?
[10:22] <Daverocks> jordo2323: you wouldn't partition it from windows. you'd finish installing windows, then i'd use something like gparted to resize your windows partition, or you could do it from the ubuntu installer
[10:23] <SilentDis> jordo2323:  I installed as follows:  WinXP, gave it 20gb of the drive.  then installed ubuntu, gave it the remaining 90gb.  during the linux install, setup the 2nd drive with [5gb swap]  [25gb /media/ostransfer as vfat]  [200gb /home ext3] 
[10:23] <jordo2323> Daverocks: Yeah....thats kind of what I thought.....I have a 75 GB drive......what partitions do I need?
[10:24] <SilentDis> zerosmoke:  i have been asking myself that question as of late.  i haven't booted my windows partition in nearly 2 months lol
[10:25] <Daverocks> jordo2323: depends how much space you want for windows, and how much you want for linux
[10:25] <msfirefox-com> may i ask

[10:26] <SilentDis> quick question:  anyone know of a gnome-compatible front-end to LAME?  i'd like to batch convert a bunch of MP3s for use in a device that doesn't have great support.  (i encode to 224vbs normally, car/work mp3-cd players need 128cbr to function well)
[10:26] <zerosmoke> noop
[10:26] <jordo2323> Daverocks:  Is that all I have to is shrink the NTFS partition and add a EXT3?
[10:26] <zerosmoke> google 'er
[10:27] <SilentDis> msfirefox-com:  stability, familiarity with *nix (been using a BSD server for years), finally saw that everything I needed was on linux (well, other than a batch mp3 converter, lol)
[10:27] <alumno> yee
[10:27] <Daverocks> jordo2323: if it's a blank hard drive, you don't need to shrink the NTFS partition, you can just say, make a 30 GB (or any other size) partition before you start and install windows onto that, then you can just make another partition for ubuntu
[10:28] <jordo2323> Daverocks: you rock
[10:28] <Daverocks> jordo2323: thanks :P
[10:28] <zerosmoke> i almost did dual boot on 20gigs but said what the heck and just did ubuntu
[10:29] <SilentDis> zerosmoke: that is a bit small for my tastes as well, had i been limited, i probably would have done the same :)
[10:29] <jordo2323> Daverocks: any Idea why when I click on Azureus it doesn't do anything if I have sun's java selected?
[10:29] <Daverocks> jordo2323: i'm not familiar with the azureus package on ubuntu but the main azureus starter should be a bash script
[10:30] <Daverocks> well, i was going to help him further :P

[10:31] <CarinArr> hey i'm having some problems with my packages.. I was installing some packages, ran out of battery, when I started back up again, everything is fine apart from the fbpager package is broken, trying to remove it synaptic just hangs at "removing fbpager ..."
[10:32] <CarinArr> or rather it doesn't hang.. the application is still running.. but it never gets further
[10:32] <SilentDis> CarinArr: you should be ok reverting to the backup package list.
[10:32] <CarinArr> silentdis, how do i do that?
[10:33] <jordo2323> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/820302
[10:33] <SilentDis> CarinArr: let me look up the files for you.  I *THINK* dapper and edgy are the same on this.
[10:33] <CarinArr> silentdis, okay, thanks
[10:34] <zerosmoke> i would be interested to know
[10:34] <jordo2323> Daverocks:  http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/820302
[10:34] <zerosmoke> i almost ran out of battery running back to my apt from the cafe
[10:34] <jordo2323> Flannel:  http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/820302
[10:34] <zerosmoke> while it was installing
[10:34] <Flannel> jordo2323: and, you're sure you're using suns java?
[10:34] <zerosmoke> :P
[10:34] <zerosmoke> it's called living on the edge
[10:34] <CarinArr> heh
[10:35] <zerosmoke> no pun intended
[10:35] <CarinArr> it's called annoying now;)
[10:35] <jordo2323> I installed sun-java5-jre
[10:35] <jordo2323> I went by the dapper instructions....
[10:35] <CarinArr> jordo2323, did you configure alternatives?
[10:35] <jordo2323> CarinArr:  Shows I did.....
[10:35] <jordo2323> CarinArr:  It says option 2 or Sun's Java is selected
[10:35] <CarinArr> jordo2323, what does "which java" do
[10:35] <Flannel> jordo2323: just to make sure, do a 'java -version'
[10:36] <CarinArr> or yeah.. that
[10:36] <SilentDis> CarinArr: you should find /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list~
[10:36] <CarinArr> silentdis, okay
[10:36] <CarinArr> just copy ~ ?
[10:36] <SilentDis> you'll probably wanna just sudo su, as you require root access.
[10:36] <Flannel> no, you'll want to use sudo
[10:36] <jordo2323> Flannel:   java version "1.5.0_08"
[10:36] <SilentDis> good point flannel
[10:37] <Daverocks> "sudo -i" is a better way to get an interactive root shell
[10:37] <CarinArr> anyhow
[10:37] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
[10:37] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list~ /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:38] <CarinArr> i don't have a sources.list~
[10:38] <CarinArr> i have a sources.list.save
[10:38] <Flannel> jordo2323: that sounds like suns version.  You'll have to ask the azuerus people (or maybe check the ubuntu forums?)  it's an error with azureus.
[10:38] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  edgy or dapper?
[10:38] <CarinArr> edgy
[10:38] <jordo2323> Flannel: Wierd....
[10:38] <cpk1> installing nvidia-settings breaks nvidia-glx right?
[10:38] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  i'm still running dapper, that's probably right.
[10:38] <Flannel> CarinArr: that's fine.  the ~ is a backup version made through certain methods
[10:38] <CarinArr> so should i copy the .save to sources.list?
[10:39] <jordo2323> Flannel: Is Azureus the best torrent client to use under linux?
[10:39] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  I would recommend backing up the old one, just in case.
[10:39] <CarinArr> on my two other machines things are running perfectly
[10:39] <CarinArr> yeah i've backed i tup
[10:39] <CarinArr> do i have to do anything else?
[10:40] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  yes, then just sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.save /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:40] <CarinArr> done
[10:40] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  relaunch and should be good.
[10:40] <Flannel> jordo2323: probably not.  There are non java options that'll probably give you better prformance, I imagine theyre not as pretty though, but it all depends on what youre looking for in a torrent client
[10:40] <CarinArr> right, ta muchly
[10:40] <jordo2323> Flannel: ever use Ktorrent?
[10:41] <SilentDis> I take it no one's herd of a batch GUI interface for LAME? :(
[10:41] <Flannel> jordo2323: Nope.  I don't have a GUI, so I use btdownloadcurses or btlaunchmanycurses ;)

[10:42] <CarinArr> *does happy dance*
[10:43] <SilentDis> CarinArr: :)  that works.  just make sure it isn't corrupted in your packages repository, and you can probably reinstall it :)

[10:43] <CarinArr> well i don't actually need it, so i'll steer clear;)
[10:44] <Spee_Der> Hi Mike

[10:49] <dreamer> hi all, I'm reinstalling ubuntu right now so I can make an extended partition containing a primary for the OS and a 2nd for swap, but in the partitioner I can't make a extended partition
[10:49] <dreamer> is this because the isk allready has an extended partition? (windows seems to be in an extended)
[10:49] <SilentDis> haydenAU: sudo apt-get nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-<your kernel version>
[10:50] <SilentDis> haydenAU: sorry.  sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-<your kernel version>
[10:50] <cbx33> guys does network-manager work on xfce?
[10:50] <haydenAU> SilentDis, thanks alot
[10:50] <SilentDis> haydenAU: after that completes: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[10:51] <haydenAU> SilentDis, Ok
[10:51] <Spee_Der> dreamer: I wonder, do you have to sudo qparted for it to work correctly ?
[10:51] <dreamer> Spee_Der: I'm in the Live-CD-install-mode right now ..
[10:51] <Spee_Der> oic
[10:51] <SilentDis> haydenAU:  after that, should just need a gnome restart.  if it breaks, you'll need to reconfigure x to use it.
[10:51] <Spee_Der> Just a thought.... I gave up for now on dual boot.
[10:51] <MikeDK> HaydenAU this link here for the Nvidia driver but if u look like a big ? then dont use it
[10:52] <dreamer> hmm
[10:52] <SilentDis> haydenAU: sorry, again.  an X restart.  it has been a long day.  lol

[10:52] <Spee_Der> Matter of fact, I only use Ubuntu on this machine.... lol
[10:52] <dreamer> wel the problem originally was that I already have 4 primary partitions, so I couldn't make an extra swap-partition
[10:52] <Spee_Der> wow
[10:52] <Spee_Der> How big is the disk ?
[10:52] <MikeDK> HaydenAU this is for dapper only ill look for a link for edgy if i can find one
[10:53] <haydenAU> yea i had the driver installed on dapper, but it broke when i upgraded to edgy
[10:53] <dreamer> Spee_Der: 300gb
[10:53] <Spee_Der> phew
[10:53] <MikeDK> HaydenAU rgr that
[10:53] <Spee_Der> further study on dual boot setup is in order I'd say
[10:53] <dreamer> but, let me explain: first partiotion is extended, 15gb  with in it a primary windows, then 15gbfor ubuntu, then 200 ntfs primary and 50 ntfs primary
[10:54] <Spee_Der> Anyone here using Enlightenmetn with success ?
[10:54] <dreamer> but, I can resize the windows partition to make room for swap apperantly
[10:54] <MikeDK> Spee_Der, why dual-boot :-))))
[10:54] <wombo> Does Ubuntu come with LVM in the kernel by default?
[10:54] <dreamer> but I cant't make that 15gb for ubuntu into an extended for that
[10:54] <Spee_Der> wombo: I beleive it does.
[10:54] <wombo> it is saying that it cant find PVCREATE
[10:55] <CarinArr> hmm
[10:55] <Spee_Der> MikeDK: Yeh huh. I have only 120 G and it is all Ubuntu, no this computer anyway.

[10:58] <SilentDis> CarinArr:  as a side note, i have yet to find a linux box that needed to have a 'completely clean install' in order to fix something, unless the kernel was totally toast and you couldn't extract it from a disk somewhere ;)
[10:59] <Spee_Der> MikeDK: With all the support in Ubuntu and Linux per se, there should be little to no problems.....
[10:59] <dreamer> aaarg, howcome you can only make 1 extended partition :S
[10:59] <dreamer> because my disk already has one :S
[10:59] <Spee_Der> MikeDK: I'd love to have a mobile wireless for all the driving I'm doing these days.
[11:00] <SilentDis> dreamer: you can only have 1 extended partition, and logical partitions go INSIDE that.
[11:00] <manmadha> any body there?
[11:00] <dreamer> SilentDis: I think I have a solution, but I lose 1gb of the unallocated space I allready have :/

[11:10] <rubso> Hey guys, where can i get Real Player for Edgy?
[11:11] <elbonzi> does anyone here know anything about programming in C?
[11:11] <rubso> elbonzi: www.cprogramming.com
[11:11] <elbonzi> ive been trying to find it on there actually but its a weird question
[11:11] <SilentDis> elbonzi: only enough to cause major horrible problems with code making changes that i THOUGHT should work and thus costing me 4 days of banging my head against before I finally give up.
[11:12] <elbonzi> haha
[11:12] <Flannel> elbonzi: #ubuntu-offtopic, or ##C
[11:12] <apokryphos> rubso: please check the FAQ
[11:13] <rubso> apokryphos: i did, Realplayer is availabe for Dapper only through Canonical Commercial Repository.
[11:13] <SilentDis> rubso: you need to download it from the realplayer website, I believe.
[11:13] <Mantice> SilentDis that did not work.
[11:14] <SilentDis> Mantice: what error did you get?
[11:14] <rubso> SilentDis: better solution please !
[11:14] <Mantice> Well you know how you point the dir to extract to.
[11:14] <SilentDis> rubso: mmm... *does a search for ffmpeg to convert .rm files to .mpegs* :P
[11:14] <CarinArr> grrrr
[11:14] <etdsdvgfhrtz> where to get hacker toolz for ubuntu?
[11:14] <Mantice> It thought thats were the rar file was.
[11:14] <rubso> SilentDis: to MP3?
[11:15] <CarinArr> so it just hang on installing java
[11:15] <CarinArr> so i had to kill it
[11:15] <CarinArr> and now it hangs on removing the part installed stuff
[11:15] <apokryphos> rubso: and it doesn't work on edgy? I recommend compiling it from source then.
[11:16] <CarinArr> *cries a little*
[11:16] <SilentDis> rubso:  i am not sure if that's even possible... though I've seen ffmpeg scripts that handle youtube movies, so it's not outside the realm of possibility :P
[11:16] <rubso> apokryphos: lol, Real Player is not open source software. its a commercial one.
[11:16] <rubso> SilentDis: indeed.
[11:16] <DarkMageZ> rubso, there are much better opensource players available for linux
[11:16] <apokryphos> rubso: whoop, I realised just after posting. I mean getting the tar.gz and firing up the binary
[11:16] <Mantice> SilentDis Dont worry It seams when you install the non free version file roller can extract them.
[11:17] <soundray> ssh-agent stopped working for me when I upgraded to edgy. Any ideas why & how to fix?
[11:17] <apokryphos> rubso: and you can also have other players play realmedia
[11:17] <SilentDis> Mantice:  that works
[11:17] <rubso> apokryphos: then that's what i'm going to do after all. but ... but.... Packages would be cool.
[11:17] <rubso> apokryphos: i know, my Default kubunt media player could play RMs but plays 3gp without sound.

[11:18] <SilentDis> a final check for my problem, as so many have come and gone:  anyone know of a batch 'converter' of sorts for MP3s?  looking for basically a batch interface for LAME with ID3 tag support.
[11:18] <etdsdvgfhrtz> no, i want hacker toolz
[11:18] <Mantice> How do you run a .sh file ???
[11:18] <etdsdvgfhrtz> not programming toolz
[11:18] <Flannel> etdsdvgfhrtz: those are hacking tools.
[11:18] <Mantice> from console ?
[11:18] <dooglus> Mantice: with bash or sh
[11:18] <rubso> Mantice: sh blah.sh
[11:18] <etdsdvgfhrtz> i want to hack a friend
[11:18] <apokryphos> etdsdvgfhrtz: for "hacking" people? No, please do not ask here.
[11:18] <dooglus> Mantice: "bash file.sh"
[11:18] <Flannel> etdsdvgfhrtz: if you want cracking tools, then... you've already got it:  telnet.  Have fun.
[11:19] <etdsdvgfhrtz> whats telnet?
[11:19] <Flannel> the only cracking tool you
[11:19] <Flannel> you'll ever need
[11:19] <dooglus> etdsdvgfhrtz: if you don't know what telnet is, then I don't think you're really ready for 'hacking people'
[11:19] <Daverocks> telnet makes basic TCP connections
[11:19] <etdsdvgfhrtz> hm?
[11:19] <SilentDis> etdsdvgfhrtz:  axes work best, as the human structure is quite soft for the most part.  bring the axe up and down in a very fast motion over said friend.  :D
[11:19] <etdsdvgfhrtz> i just need msn hack

[11:19] <Mantice> Thanks
[11:20] <Spee_Der> Time to get ready for work, later all...
[11:20] <etdsdvgfhrtz> do not you have msn hack?
[11:20] <DarkMageZ> etdsdvgfhrtz, why do you think people in the ubuntu channel would help you with hacking? try something like hackthissite.org
[11:20] <etdsdvgfhrtz> oh

[11:27] <coz_> soundray, my suggestion will be irritating however, I never suggest an upgrade from one version to another, the errors can be potentially damaging, I always suggest a clean install, there will be thoses here that disagree with me

[11:30] <SilentDis> rubso: yay!  did you pull a .deb from their homepage or the like?
[11:30] <apokryphos> rubso: with the binary?
[11:31] <rubso> SilentDis, apokryphos: yes with the binary.

[11:33] <visik7> I've a problem with edgy and a custom kernel : I've build my custom kernel with the same configure of 2.6.17-10-generic and add only one option ( Compile the kernel with debug info ) and I hadn't remove anything, all works fine slash screen and all the peripherals but if I boot in console nothing is visible expect a blinking cursor and resolution 1400x1050 (setuped via vga=0x348 at kernel boot parameters) doesn't working
[11:33] <neil__> rubso: it still crashes occasionally
[11:33] <hastesaver> How does one extract images from a PDF file?
[11:33] <rubso> neil_: i tried once in Dapper Drake "Ubuntu" and it was crashing like ****
[11:34] <hastesaver> There is a commandline tool called pdfimages, which is part of xpdf.utils, but it never seems to work
[11:34] <SilentDis> hastesaver:  i *think* you can copy them with the reader util... otherwise, you're doing a screen cap and editing it in gimp, i'm sorry to say.
[11:34] <rubso> now it crashes less in Edgy cuz its still a beta, but the video and audio is better in fp9
[11:34] <dooglus> hastesaver: I've only ever done it by taking a screenshot

[11:37] <Curuxz> Hey all :)
[11:37] <coz_> Curuxz, welcome
[11:37] <Curuxz> I want some advice from you lot on 'pimping my ride' lol
[11:37] <pussypower> aFUNNY
[11:37] <pussypower> LOL
[11:37] <Curuxz> I do web design and cad and for years have had 2 17" crt's which have annoyed the crap out of me
[11:38] <Curuxz> so i finaly desided to get a 32" inch flatscreen, so now my pc looks cool, so i need to tweek the software
[11:38] <pussypower> lol jews lol wtc
[11:38] <Curuxz> there is a lagitimate reason behind wanting to 'pimp' it since i have clients in here and it needs to look proffesional
[11:38] <SilentDis> Curuxz:  only 2?  I do web dev and have a 19" LCD and a 17" and find it limiting.  I am not surprized you're looking for better. :)
[11:39] <Curuxz> i have been playing with E17 all morning it looks great but is a little......buggy :S any ideas for getting a really powerfull system that actauly has a working system tray lol

[11:39] <Curuxz> silent, at one point i used 4 crt's! lol you need so much space when doing design
[11:40] <apokryphos> Curuxz: also, if you have a good card you can't really get better eyecandy than with Xgl and Beryl
[11:40] <SilentDis> Curuxz:  oh I bet.  web dev just has me using a lot of refrence material.  I can only imagine what it's like for CAD design :)
[11:40] <Curuxz> this 32" is rated 1377x768 but in linux works at 1600x1200 with out breaking a sweat crystal clear and now im using only 1 screen it makes things like xgl easy (since dual can be a bitch)
[11:40] <cbx33> ooooh
[11:40] <Curuxz> whats berryl for kde or gnome?
[11:40] <apokryphos> Curuxz: GNOME and KDE are both good
[11:41] <cbx33> beryl is gorgeous
[11:41] <visik7> anyone with a custom kernel ?
[11:41] <Curuxz> i have herd a lot about berrl but have not really seen it in action
[11:41] <Curuxz> do you guys think it beats E17 in 'bling' ? lol
[11:41] <apokryphos> Curuxz: let me get you a link, then :)
[11:41] <SilentDis> apokryphos:  thank you for those links btw.  always nice to make pretty hehe :)
[11:41] <coz_> Curuxz, a window manager that is cool take a look on youtube.com and type beryl in to watch a video

[11:43] <tahorg> hi, I've got a problem after a fresh mysql-server-5.0 install
[11:43] <[Nige] > hi all
[11:43] <tahorg> after the install the mysqld starts
[11:43] <Curuxz> i have an Gforce fx 5200 i think
[11:43] <cbx33> ooho
[11:43] <Curuxz> one of the crappy ones :( lol
[11:43] <tahorg> but an /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[11:43] <cbx33> that's a little low
[11:43] <tahorg> gives me a fail.
[11:43] <coz_> Curuxz, enough for this hole on i will give link to how to
[11:43] <cbx33> would probably still work...
[11:44] <Curuxz> thanks :)
[11:44] <cbx33> but may be slow
[11:44] <soundray> Can you recommend a procedure for changing graphics cards? I'm using an onboard ATI with the ati driver now, and I have a NVidia card that I want to switch to.
[11:44] <apokryphos> Curuxz: not ideal, but it's good enough for most things on there.
[11:44] <Curuxz> beryl looks sweet!
[11:44] <coz_> Curuxz, here you go read first slwoly, the proceed carefully   http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[11:44] <Curuxz> thanks for your help ill give it a go :D
[11:45] <Curuxz> i am going to reinstall edgy from scratch first since i have been running the beta from day 1
[11:45] <Curuxz> and all the patches and hacks over the last 4 months have caused a few probs ;)
[11:45] <zerosmoke> one way to make ms sweat, and help ubuntu along, make it easier for everybody, and no i'm not a treehugger, just trying to push a good thing along...register on the ubuntu forums, it's easy, and write a little how to about how you did it...
[11:45] <coz_> Curuxz, that would be a wise Idea
[11:46] <coz_> Curuxz, do all the updates etc before you do beryl
[11:46] <Curuxz> then ill try the howto, hopefully i can return to my native KDE with this beryl thing
[11:46] <Curuxz> yeah will do :)
[11:46] <zerosmoke> !beryl
[11:46] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[11:46] <coz_> Curuxz, the how to I gave you is for gnome hole on i will find KDE how to
[11:46] <Curuxz> oh rite...... thanks :D
[11:47] <coz_> Curuxz, actually there should be little difference
[11:47] <coz_> Curuxz, but let me check
[11:47] <Curuxz> if i just chose to load kde instead of gnome it will just transfer tho rite?
[11:47] <Curuxz> since it is attached to X server by the looks of things
[11:49] <coz_> Curuxz, here is another one, you may want to refer to both how tos and glean the appropriate moves   http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
[11:49] <Curuxz> thanks coz :)
[11:49] <coz_> Curuxz,  no problem and good luck!!!
[11:50] <Curuxz> :D ill give it a go, later guys have a nice day!
[11:50] <coz_> Curuxz, another suggestion is to google KDE beryl buntu to be sure
[11:50] <coz_> ubuntu

[12:00] <Tschaka> e_machinist "configure --enable-application=APP" so this one doenst work? oO
[12:00] <thegve> rc-1: Is there a cross through the volume manager in the panel bar?
[12:00] <rc-1> master says 00
[12:00] <thegve> rc-1: In that case your sound card wasn't detected
[12:00] <neil__> cbx33: i can't find the reference to it atm. i'll look again
[12:00] <dreamer> hmm, what is the mointpoint for swap ?
[12:00] <thegve> rc-1: It is detected then :)
[12:01] <rc-1> the volume bar has no cross
[12:01] <rc-1> drat thanks anyways
[12:01] <tobias> netpython: ctrl+alt+f1-6 just show a screwed-up screen, but no console... in dapper this worked just fine!
[12:01] <neil__> dreamer: none :)
[12:01] <netpython> tobias, strange
[12:01] <coz_> tobias, out of curoisity, did you upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[12:01] <tobias> netpython: Indeed! :-)
[12:01] <e_machinist> Tschaka: when I run "configure --enable-application=APP" I also get, configure: error: --enable-application=APP is required
[12:01] <rc-1> brb ill open up comp and make sure its plugged in
[12:02] <coz_> tobias, or clean install
[12:02] <dreamer> neil__: kay, so I don't need to edit fstab?
[12:02] <cbx33> ahhh that would make sense
[12:02] <dreamer> I think swapon already fixed it anyway ..
[12:02] <Tschaka> e_machinist http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2484066&sid=2c272aee5d94cff1347ed9f5fe9c4399 try this one
[12:02] <tobias> netpython: I just don't want to have to boot into recovery-mode every time I play around with xorg.conf ...
[12:03] <neil__> dreamer: partition none swap sw 0 0
[12:03] <netpython> tobias, fair enough
[12:03] <neil__> dreamer: you need that for swapon -a at startup to activate swap
[12:03] <e_machinist> Tschaka: dang, you got magic "find exact problems" powers?
[12:03] <Tschaka> tobias sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop should give you a console xD
[12:03] <dreamer> neil__: the swap already shows up in top
[12:03] <Tschaka> e_machinist i got google :D
[12:03] <dreamer> and free
[12:04] <tobias> coz: First an upgrade, then I played around TOO much ;-) and did a fresh install just yesterday ... the problem appeared on both the dapper-edgy upgraded system as well as my fresh install I'm using right now.
[12:04] <neil__> dreamer: ok but every system i've ever used puts entries for swap in fstab
[12:04] <dreamer> ok
[12:04] <dreamer> it's not in there now ..
[12:05] <soundray> tobias: try booting with the vga=ask option
[12:05] <neil__> dreamer: my clean install of edgy put an entry in for me
[12:05] <netpython> tobias, do you have an issue logged in /var/log/messages telling more about the nature of the problem by the way?
[12:06] <neil__> tobias: booting in single-user mode is a good alternative to recovery
[12:06] <ANaRcHiC-nix> coz_: hello, i spoke to u the other day about installing beryl etc?
[12:07] <e_machinist> Are there any Open Source web browsers aside from the Mozilla stuff and Konq?
[12:07] <neil__> e_machinist: do you mean not based on their technology?
[12:07] <netpython> e_machinist, epiphany,galeon
[12:08] <MikeyMike> i have a question about firefox
[12:08] <MikeyMike> anyone up
[12:08] <neil__> MikeyMike: ask away
[12:08] <netpython> MikeyMike, State the nature of your problem
[12:08] <e_machinist> neil__: yes, not based on their technology.
[12:08] <dreamer> hmm, I have a Q about FF to: can I use all my windows-settings in linux ?
[12:09] <MikeyMike> haha you know... i come in here regularly and i totally asked to ask a question.... haha i feel dumb
[12:09] <MikeyMike> anyway.
[12:09] <MikeyMike> my problem is i installed a couple firefox extentions and uninstalled them... and they're still 'there'
[12:09] <dreamer> MikeyMike: isn't it the point of this channel/ to ask questions? ;)
[12:09] <MikeyMike> haha yes
[12:09] <MikeyMike> they all had to do with autoscrolling
[12:09] <Pensacola> I'm having some problems configuring ubuntu to connect to my wireless school network
[12:10] <MikeyMike> i didnt realize firefox had autoscroll built in
[12:10] <tobias> netpython: The only thing in messages when trying ctrl+alt+f1-6 is "Loading R300 Microcode" ... The screen gets all screwed up like a bad graphics driver or something ... that's it then. I can still switch back to ctrl+alt+f7 luckily!
[12:10] <MikeyMike> im using firefox 1.5.07
[12:10] <MikeyMike> basically i've found that my about:config has a lot of bullcrap in it and i want to clear out the extentions
[12:10] <MikeyMike> entries
[12:11] <Matthai> quick question: how is it called ubuntu's graphical partitioner (which package is it)?
[12:11] <tobias> neil_: There MUST be an alternative to rebooting when I just hung up my X-server ...
[12:11] <MikeyMike> anyone know?
[12:11] <netpython> tobias, after ctrl-alt-f1 a alt-f7 without ctlr is enough :-) What driver do you use?
=== pc3 is now known as cWe_PiNkErZzZ
[12:11] <floating> hey whats up if I try remove a mod with rmmod modulename, it says it isnt module or something like that
[12:11] <Daverocks> floating: does "modprobe -r modulename" produce the same output?
[12:11] <floating> or not found even if it was on lsmod list
[12:11] <neil__> tobias: can you Ctrl-Alt-F1 and kill from there?
[12:11] <floating> yea
[12:11] <MikeyMike> if anyone knows just say my name in in #firefox as well
[12:12] <floating> whats the difference doing /sbin/rmmod modname
=== cWe_PiNkErZzZ is now known as cWe_ImOeTzZzZ
[12:12] <tobias> neil_: No. ctrl+alt+f1 just brings up a messed-up screen...
[12:12] <Daverocks> floating: don't know if there is a difference, just taking a stab here :P
[12:12] <tobias> neil_: As do f2-6
[12:13] <floating> i ll try the sbin when i be able to try it out next time
[12:13] <coz_> tobias when did y ou install the os
[12:13] <hwt> hi, i'm having problems getting fglrx to run on my newly installed edgy.
[12:14] <hwt> could it be that i'm missing some packages?
[12:14] <tobias> netpython: Right now I'm using the regularly 'ati' driver shipped with edgy ... but I used 'fglrx' on my dapper->edgy upgraded box. Same problem there.
[12:14] <hwt> i have restricted-modules and restricted-modules-common, in addition to the fglrx-drivers.
[12:14] <coz_> hwt have you taken a look at all the how tos for this
[12:14] <tobias> coz_: The edgy I'm using right now? 12h ago...
[12:14] <coz_> tobias, and it was a clean install?
[12:15] <netpython> coz_, upgrade
[12:15] <coz_> upgrade
[12:15] <hwt> coz_: URL?
[12:15] <tobias> coz_: Yes, I downloaded the iso again, burnt it, checked the md5 after burning ... everything was ok.
[12:15] <coz_> hwt, hold on let me look
[12:16] <ekimus> does ldap use tcp or udp by default?
[12:16] <Adn1> hi here I'm again :) I could bring my wlan to work

[12:17] <Adn1> lol why is Adna still here  and I'm no Adn1?
[12:17] <Adn1> now
[12:17] <hwt> oh, so the fglrx install isn't straight forward anymore?
[12:17] <Kannix> I found a DVD-RAM disk and wanted to use it for backup. Did anybody ever use a DVD-RAM under Ubuntu and can tell me, how I format/access/write on one?
[12:17] <dreamer> so, does anyone if/how I can import all my windows-firefox-configs ?
[12:17] <coz_> hwt, well i am not skilled with this so my suggestion is to google  sorry
[12:17] <floating> Daverocks: I might have to remove this bcm43xx driver that is alternatively installed(i guess) I remember doing lsmod, and seeing many modules, that might be associated with this mod or so, do you think I might need to remove more than exactly this mod
[12:18] <floating> driver=mod
[12:18] <Daverocks> no idea, sorry :(
[12:19] <Adn1> but now I've got another problem I wanna install ubuntuu but this installation-agent of ubuntu doesnt get my partitions right. it sais 91 GB are not used but cfdisk and fdisk in the console show it right?!?

[12:19] <maxb> In Dapper's XWindows, holding down Ctrl+Shift and typing hex digits inserted that character code. This has mysteriously stopped working in Edgy. Does anyone know about this, or the name of the component which provides such behaviour?
[12:20] <Juhaz> maxb, it needs to be initiated with "u" before the hex digits now
[12:20] <spyder404> yoplaroom !!
[12:20] <Juhaz> and the component is gtk
[12:20] <spyder404> a fart !!
[12:20] <spyder404> oups !!
[12:20] <spyder404> hi all !
[12:20] <spyder404> what's up !!
[12:21] <spyder404> what's news !!
[12:21] <spyder404> someone alive ?
[12:21] <maxb> Juhaz: Thanks!... if it requires, "u", then is there any way to get Ctrl+Shift+C to be passed through as a normal keypress, for apps like thunderbird, which map that to a useful function?
[12:21] <Hoxzer> we're all DEAD
[12:21] <neil__> tobias: i'm using the ati driver in xorg with xorg's aiglx for my ATI9200 based card. i had to reboot to single-user to fix xorg.conf after i enabled AGPFastWrite
[12:22] <spyder404> :)
[12:22] <spyder404> hav a good tim !!
[12:23] <Juhaz> maxb, I would assume that's the whole reason for the change, and those keypresses should now pass through automatically
[12:23] <maxb> Unfortunately, no.
[12:26] <neil__> has anyone noticed of their GNOME desktop starts a little faster with avahi-daemon configured and running?

[12:27] <visik7> I've a problem with edgy and a custom kernel : I've build my custom kernel with the same configure of 2.6.17-10-generic and add only one option ( Compile the kernel with debug info ) and I hadn't remove anything, all works fine slash screen and all the peripherals but if I boot in console nothing is visible expect a blinking cursor and resolution 1400x1050 (setuped via vga=0x348 at kernel boot parameters) doesn't working
[12:27] <Juhaz> maxb, ctrl+shift+a works for me in firefox and thunderbird, this is in fc6, not edgy, but should be the same...
[12:28] <maxb> Juhaz: Interesting... you're right. C-S-A does work, but C-S-C doesn't.
[12:28] <Juhaz> I didn't find any menu entry with c-s-c in tb, what should it do?
[12:28] <Juhaz> or is it from extension?
[12:28] <dreamer> so, does anyone know if/how I can import all my windows-firefox-configs ?
[12:30] <dooglus> dreamer: did you try copying your windows profile into ~/.mozilla/firefox/ ?
[12:31] <Dimensions> hi my firefox crashes every time i open any page it doesn't stays for more than few seconds is there any other web browser i can download ?
[12:31] <Dimensions> i even removed and re downloaded fire fox but doesn't work
[12:31] <dreamer> dooglus: not yet :#
[12:32] <niktaris> are there anywhere firefox extensions in .deb format ?
[12:32] <dooglus> dreamer: something like: cp -r /mnt/c/Documents\ and\ Settings/<user>/Application\ Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/*.default ~/.mozilla/firefox/
[12:32] <dooglus> dreamer: (once you've got your windows C drive mounted as /mnt/c, of course)
[12:33] <webben> niktaris, Not AFAIK. Why do you need them?
[12:33] <niktaris> webben, I wanted them installed system-wide
[12:34] <webben> niktaris: ah... yeah, I think there's an extension to help you with that, but no debs AFAIK.
[12:34] <niktaris> webben, what extension ?
[12:35] <webben> niktaris: not sure ... I suspect it's probably not worth it
[12:35] <webben> it might be easier to create a add user script which installs them
[12:35] <webben> when a new user is created
[12:36] <dooglus> niktaris: can you install the extensions into /usr/lib/firefox/extensions/ ?
[12:36] <dooglus> niktaris: some extensions are available in the repositories which do exactly that.  for example:
[12:36] <dooglus> !info mozilla-imagezoom
[12:36] <ubotu> mozilla-imagezoom: Mozilla context menu option to zoom current image. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.5-1 (edgy), package size 68 kB, installed size 272 kB
[12:37] <maxb> Juhaz: It's "Mark folder as read"
[12:37] <webben> niktaris, http://lwn.net/Articles/186663/ might help
[12:38] <dooglus> niktaris: available packages are: firefox-dom-inspector, firefox-greasemonkey, firefox-themes-ubuntu, firefox-webdeveloper, mozilla-biofox, mozilla-bookmarksftp, mozilla-checky, mozilla-ctxextensions, mozilla-diggler, mozilla-imagezoom, mozilla-livehttpheaders, mozilla-mozgest, mozilla-nukeimage, mozilla-stumbleupon, mozilla-tabextensions, and mozilla-venkman
[12:39] <webben> dooglus, are those packages kept properly up to date do you know?
[12:40] <dooglus> webben: I doubt it.  they're in ubuntu universe...
[12:41] <webben> yeah ... in that case I'd tend to prefer the latest xpi
[12:41] <manux> Hello some one knows how this can be resolved when client try to attempt ppp connexion over my linux box ,?
[12:41] <manux> Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP
[12:43] <dooglus> webben: for instance, the first one I checked, image zoom is 0.2.5 in the repository and 0.2.7 on https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/139/ .  0.2.7 was released Sep 26, 2006, about 2 weeks ago.
[12:43] <dooglus> sorry, about 6 or 7 weeks ago!
[12:43] <webben> hmmm ... not great but could be worse
[12:43] <webben> perhaps apt-get source
[12:44] <niktaris> dooglus, thanks
[12:44] <webben> and replace the xpi
[12:44] <dreamer> dooglus: didn't work :S
[12:44] <dreamer> then I removed the old profile .. and now it says Firefox is already running :/
[12:45] <dooglus> dreamer: rename the profile you copied to be exactly the same as the old profile you removed.  firefox is expecting your profile to be called <random-stuff>.default
[12:45] <rc-1> hhmmm no sound :( i checked and appears sound card is plugged in right
[12:45] <Juhaz> maxb, http://www.mozilla.org/support/thunderbird/keyboard says it's just shift+c in linux
[12:45] <dreamer> dooglus: aarg, don't know what it was called :s
[12:45] <dooglus> dreamer: reading ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini will tell you
[12:45] <rc-1> and sb audigory is detected in device manager
[12:45] <dooglus> dreamer: the 'path=' bit
[12:46] <dreamer> er .. I already replaced the name in the ini with the new one :#

[12:46] <Jaak> the same happens with fireworks 8, not with dreamweaver
[12:46] <dooglus> Jaak: flash 8 is a windows program isn't it?

[12:48] <manux> Hello some one knows how to resolve this ? Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP
[12:48] <dooglus> dreamer: I'll try it here with my old windows firefox profile and see if that works.
[12:48] <dreamer> hmz :/
[12:49] <dreamer> it says I should restart, I restarted X but that didn't work
[12:49] <dreamer> thnx for helping :)
[12:49] <boni> does anyone know where the bluetooth configuration files are kept??
[12:49] <rem__> Hey...Since I upgrade to Edgy Evolution keeps on freezing. Anyone else had that problem...anything that can be done ?
[12:49] <Dimensions> Hiya ... again ... I have installed mozilla and it got installed but doesn't start while firefox crashes after few seconds
[12:50] <Juhaz> maxb, probably a workaround due to the gtk previously stealing those keys, guess it could/should be changed again in thunderbird now that that's no longer an issue...
[12:50] <boni> i mean where are the bluetooth configuration files on Dapper??
[12:50] <dooglus> dreamer: I see the same error - that firefox is in use (it isn't)

[01:04] <netpython> rc-1, lsmod |grep snd_ich
[01:04] <dooglus> dreamer: good, isn't it?  the problem is, your windows partition was mounted readonly, so when you copied the files, the copies were read-only, too, which meant firefox wasn't able to mark the profile 'in use', so it thought it must already be in use...
[01:04] <Paddy_EIRE> anyone fancy helping me fix my edgy upgrade

[01:06] <dooglus> niru: Red Hat was founded by entrepreneur Marc Ewing in 1993.  read http://www.salon.com/tech/view/1999/10/04/marc_ewing/
[01:06] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: is there any way you can now? such as create a tar file of your home directory and then copy it to a USB drive or something?
[01:07] <niru> dooglus:so He is from US
[01:07] <Paddy_EIRE> ben_underscore: well there is other such things that I wish to keep that are not in my /home directory
[01:07] <valehru> Paddy_EIRE, if you can get into the main desktop then you should be able to log in via the console.....
[01:07] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: because i would suggest that and then do a fresh install of ubuntu and then copy your backed up home directory and restore it
[01:07] <gemeindebau> hello all; i must be doing something wrong because i am totally unable to play xvid movies (in avi container). i think i followed about every instruction i could find, and still totem gives me that errormessage about missing plugins. can anybody guide me through the necessary checks to see if i actually did install everything? thanks
[01:07] <dooglus> niru: apparently so.  but in 1995 Red Hat was bought out by ACC Bookstores, run by a Canadian, Bob Young
[01:07] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: true - there always are
[01:08] <Paddy_EIRE> ben_underscore: I have cd-r and dvd+r
[01:08] <valehru> Paddy_EIRE, from the console, mount the usb drive - storage device and copy everything there.
[01:08] <Paddy_EIRE> k
[01:08] <dooglus> niru: its corporate headquarters are in Raleigh, North Carolina
[01:08] <valehru>  Paddy_EIRE do you have a second machine set up?
[01:08] <Paddy_EIRE> no
[01:08] <ben_underscore> valehru: can you burn to dvd+r from a command line :-)
[01:08] <dooglus> niru: see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat
[01:08] <Paddy_EIRE> ben_underscore: how
[01:09] <valehru> ben_underscore, not that I last looked..
[01:09] <valehru> :)
[01:09] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: how for what?
[01:09] <Paddy_EIRE> the dvd command line
[01:09] <niru> dooglus:ok
[01:09] <rc-1> netpython, that doesnt do anything :(
[01:10] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: also make sure you run a md5sum on your TAR file you create and then use that again to compare it to the file after you copy it back and forth so it is exactly the same file
[01:10] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: you cannot burn DVDs on the comand line :-(
[01:10] <defrysk> ben42, yes you can
[01:10] <defrysk> ben-uthat is
[01:10] <Daverocks> doesn't cdrecord work for burning dvds?
[01:10] <Paddy_EIRE> is it possible for me 2 download the edgy iso from this livecd and use my other drive to burn it
[01:10] <defrysk> underscore even
[01:11] <valehru> ben_underscore, yes you can,
[01:11] <ben_underscore> valehru: i stand corrected
[01:11] <rc-1> anyone have an idea to get sound to work, not musting anything and volume at 100
[01:11] <valehru> ben_underscore, anything can be done via the command line, even cure world peace....you can not however burn a dvd with a read only drive however.
=== starkruz1 is now known as starkruzr
[01:12] <Paddy_EIRE> valehru: is it possible for me 2 download the edgy iso from this dapper livecd and use my other drive dvdrw to burn it
[01:12] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE needs to archive off his files to DVD from the command line so he can do a fresh install of edgy
[01:13] <defrysk> Paddy_EIRE, you can burn iso with cdrdao but you have to make a small TOC file
[01:13] <phanter> hi people, how can I check why my sound card is not working (command line)
[01:13] <Paddy_EIRE> defrysk: so If i download the iso where does it get stored
[01:13] <melvin> i'm using acer aspire 5050 : how to repair sound problem and wireless
[01:13] <MM2> could some1 please file a bug report: Ubuntu won't reg. my usb keyboard nor mouse
[01:13] <dxdemetriou> I have problem with /dev/dsp. every restart swaps the dsp and dsp1 and I don't know each time what dsp is for soundcard nd what for tvcard
[01:14] <Paddy_EIRE> defrysk: im running from a dapper livecd
[01:14] <defrysk> Paddy_EIRE, you have to mount a partition on your harddrive to download it too
[01:14] <defrysk> too = to
[01:15] <Paddy_EIRE> defrysk: could you help me do this
[01:15] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: and your feisty install is not working off the hard drive? can you boot into safe mode?
[01:15] <dxdemetriou> Is there any way to define the dsp for soundcard and the dsp1 for tvcard?
[01:15] <defrysk> Paddy_EIRE, listen to ben_underscore for now please
[01:15] <doctorow> When I woke up this morning, /dev/sda1 was 100 percent full -- I'm running Edgy on a ThinkPad T60p.
[01:16] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: sorry that should have been edgy, not feisty. stupid names!!
[01:16] <defrysk> lol ben_underscore
[01:16] <doctorow> Can anyone help me figure out why /dev/sda1 is sitting at 100 percent full? I can't even boot my machine
[01:17] <Q-FUNK> boing boing on the bridge.
[01:17] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Yup -- any ideas about /dev/sda1?
[01:17] <dooglus> dxdemetriou: you need to put a udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d I think.  at least, that's how I stopped eth1 and eth2 randomly swapping over at each boot
[01:18] <zerosmoke> umm...did you mess around in the partitioner lately?
[01:18] <doctorow> zerosmoke Nope
[01:18] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: probably because your /var/log or /tmp is full
[01:18] <Paddy_EIRE> ben_underscore: im creating a partition for the edgy live cd download as I do not have my original at hand
[01:18] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: what sort of hardware is it?  SCSI disk as rootis not so comon these days.
[01:19] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: ah.
[01:19] <doctorow> Q-FUNK It's a ThinkPad t60p
[01:19] <dxdemetriou> dooglus, how can I do that? :)
[01:20] <raghu206> how to installl aiglx in edgy for intel machines
[01:20] <doctorow> Q-FUNK I've emptied out /tmp and I'm looking at /var/log now -- it seems like it's only 8912k
[01:20] <chuckyp> raghu206, /j #ubuntu-xgl
[01:20] <frinov> i need help getting skype to work on ubuntu edgy thinkpad 570. audio capture is not working
[01:20] <chuckyp> !skype > frinov
[01:20] <rc-1> help i have no sound
[01:21] <chuckyp> !sound > rc-1
[01:21] <frinov> chuckyp, it fails for arecord as well
[01:21] <ben_underscore> Paddy_EIRE: my advice is to do nothing until you can get near an external hard drive or vice versa. then archive off all the files you need to the external drive, making sure to take md5sums of each TAR file and checking the files have not been corrupted. then wipe your drive and do a fresh install of edgy. it's a pain but the cleanest approach
[01:21] <Paddy_EIRE> ben_underscore: if this partiton creates properly is it possible to mount my other edgy install and copy my home dir over
[01:21] <frinov> it is a config problem with alsa.conf
[01:21] <doctorow> Q-FUNK I cd'ed to /var and did a du -k
[01:21] <chuckyp> frinov, check out levels with alsamixer
[01:21] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: did it empty anythng?  next, I'd try 'apt-get clean' to empty the APT cache.
[01:21] <frinov> that is generated by edgy
[01:22] <frinov> chuckyp, i can record if i arecord -D plughw:0,0 but not if arecord without -D
[01:22] <ben_underscore> and now i have to go to bed. it is late.
[01:22] <ben_underscore> good luck
[01:22] <rc-1> chuckyp, thanks :)
[01:22] <frinov> are you familiar with alsa.conf, that is where the issue is coming from
[01:22] <doctorow> Q-FUNK df still says /dev/sda1 is 100 percent full
[01:22] <chuckyp> frinov, did you try alsamixer
[01:22] <frinov> chuckyp, yes, i mentioned that i can record with arecord -D plughw
[01:23] <ailean> Lahey, how did you get on?
[01:23] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: assides from the percentages shown, do the disk size and used size differ?
[01:23] <chuckyp> frinov, hrm... well i'm not to familiar with alsa.conf
[01:23] <chuckyp> rc-1, np
[01:23] <frinov> ok
[01:23] <chuckyp> frinov, hrm.. why is alsa.conf not in /etc
[01:23] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Yes -- 1k-blocks = 10080488, Used=9893636
[01:24] <frinov> chuckyp, on edgy, it is in /usr/share/alsa
[01:24] <chuckyp> frinov, thats annoying
[01:24] <christefano> hi folks. I'm going through my command history and it appears that one of my colleagues installed MySQL and PHP5 over my the installation I already had. could this be the cause of why my /phpinfo.php file is spitting out errors?
[01:24] <chuckyp> frinov, yeah I found it just wierd that its not in /etc
[01:24] <frinov> huh? at me? chuckyp
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-out
[01:24] <chuckyp> frinov, yes its wierd that in edgy its in /usr/share/alsa instead of in /etc
[01:25] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: another trick to try would be to delete the APT package lists in /var/lib/apt/lists/
[01:25] <niru> chuckyp:Does ubuntu edgy support tamil and other indian languages when fonts are installed
[01:25] <cccharles> I've used other distros. Any convenient way to get a command line "mail" command in ubuntu?
[01:25] <frinov> anyway, i need to find out how to make skype be able to read from the default plughw
[01:25] <ailean> niru, yes
[01:25] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Can I just rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists without b0rking anything?
[01:26] <niru> ailean:can I get the list of indian languages that ubuntu will support
[01:26] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: erm.. nope.  you'd rather delete the individual files
[01:26] <ailean> niru, all major indian languages are supported
[01:26] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Which files?
[01:26] <ailean> niru, 2 mins
[01:26] <niru> ailean:ok I shall wait
[01:26] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: in that directory, with file names reminescent of URL
[01:26] <chuckyp> niru, no idea perhaps search for rosetta in the forums.
[01:26] <chuckyp> !in
[01:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about in - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:27] <doctorow> Q-FUNK It looks like the dir is only 27MB
[01:28] <christefano> any help would be appreciated here. I've been sandbagged with this assignment and have been having problems at every turn.
[01:28] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: which is still sizable enough.  I'd say try deleting them just to make space.  it should at least reboot fine afterwards.
[01:28] <ailean> niru, tamil has about 20% support, but that takes care of most of what you will see. you can help with the translation effort if you like!
[01:28] <doctorow> Q-FUNK What do you mean by "reminiscent of a URL?"
[01:28] <christefano> would installing MySQL and PHP5 over previous installations cause problems?
[01:28] <ailean> niru, although it is only 20%, the rest of the untranslated tamil is in lesser-known packages
[01:28] <rc-1> hmmm i changed from onboard device to SB adgiry in both volume control and volume preferences, but alsamixer is still showing my integrated card help plz
[01:28] <ChaosFan>  /wg 30
[01:28] <chuckyp> christefano, yeah why don't you remove the old versions first.
[01:29] <|_SpY_|> where i can find php.ini on ubuntu?
[01:29] <christefano> it's too late for that, I'm afraid
[01:29] <ailean> niru,      . :)
[01:29] <niru> ailean:But at present I want to know which other languages also does ubuntu support
[01:29] <ailean> niru, https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+translations
[01:29] <christefano> I'm going through my command history and it appears that one of my colleagues installed MySQL and PHP5 over my the installation I already had by apt-getting without looking first
[01:29] <chuckyp> |_SpY_|, /etc/php#  somewher ein there.
[01:30] <chuckyp> |_SpY_|, or just locate php.ini
[01:30] <|_SpY_|> chuckyp thankz
[01:30] <|_SpY_|> how i locate the file?
[01:30] <chuckyp> |_SpY_|, "locate php.ini"  you may have to update the locate database first using "sudo updatedb"
[01:31] <cccharles> would apt-get install -f help christefano?
[01:31] <chuckyp> |_SpY_|, updatedb will take a few minutes
[01:31] <netpython> rc-1, is your onboard device still enabled in bios?
[01:31] <Q-FUNK> ailean: wee!
[01:31] <chuckyp> christefano, how did they install it?
[01:31] <christefano> cccharles, I'm familiar with apt-get
[01:31] <ailean> sorry Q-FUNK?
[01:31] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: e.g. in mine, I have filenames like fi.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy-updates_universe_binary-i386_Packages
[01:31] <chuckyp> christefano, from source?
[01:31] <cccharles> christefano: sorry, no insult intended
[01:32] <rc-1> netpython, let me check, ill brb!
[01:32] <christefano> I'm just unsure if there will be problems now that my colleague installed over the previous installation
[01:32] <netpython> rc-1, k
[01:32] <Q-FUNK> ailean: whatever language that was, it looks fun
[01:32] <christefano> she used "apt-get install mysql" and "apt-get install php5"
[01:32] <doctorow> Q-FUNK So anything with "ubuntu.com" in the name?
[01:32] <chuckyp> christefano, well if youc an find out how he installed it we could help you uninstall it.  If you find a source directory just go in there and sudo make uninstall
[01:32] <ailean> Q-FUNK, oh, that's Tamil :)
[01:32] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: yup
[01:32] <chuckyp> christefano, if he used apt do sudo apt-get remove --purge php  or whatever the package he installed is.
[01:33] <chuckyp> christefano, if he used a .deb you can dpkg -r whatever.deb
[01:33] <Q-FUNK> ailean: I'll have mine with curry and rice, thanks. ;)
[01:33] <ailean> Q-FUNK, behave yourself
[01:33] <christefano> chuckyp: I'm wondering if installing MySQL and PHP5 over a previous installation is a no-no.
[01:33] <chuckyp> christefano, probably
[01:33] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Deleted all the files in the dir and sda1 is *still* full!
[01:33] <christefano> to be honest, I need the grounds for getting her off of this server
[01:33] <ailean> niru, Punjabi, Hindi, Tamil, Nepali, English, Bengali, Gujurari, and Urdu as far as i can see
[01:34] <niru> ailean:ok
[01:34] <chuckyp> christefano, change passwords that will get them off.
[01:34] <niru> ailean:I am also searching
[01:34] <dooglus> doctorow: run a "df ." in the directory.  it'll tell you whether the directory is on /dev/sda1 or not
[01:34] <christefano> oh if it were only that simple...
[01:34] <dooglus> doctorow: (see the 'mounted on' field)
[01:34] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: yup.  df is sily like that.  the system won't acknowledge the space that you freed until you have rebooted
[01:34] <ailean> niru, it is easy to help translate. please consider helping out.
[01:34] <doctorow> Q-FUNK It is
[01:35] <cccharles> Anybody know of a command line "mail" command available for ubuntu similar to that in other distros?
[01:35] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Rebooting now (it's a different PC)
[01:35] <niru> ailean:ya I have registered myself as a member for translation
[01:35] <ailean> niru, if you speak these languages, they badly need work, and you will be helping India by doing it.
[01:35] <ailean> niru, thanks :)
[01:35] <dooglus> cccharles: install package 'mailx'
[01:35] <niru> ailean:Are you from india
[01:35] <cccharles> thx, dooglus
[01:35] <ailean> niru, no, i'm from scotland
[01:35] <niru> ailean:oh
[01:35] <zerosmoke> can't you tell by the accent?
[01:35] <zerosmoke> ;)
[01:35] <ailean> lol
[01:36] <rc-1> it was on, just turned it off but still no sound
[01:36] <netpython> cmon aileen :-)
[01:36] <ailean> netpython, aileAn :)  i'm a guy
[01:36] <zerosmoke> aye laddie
[01:36] <netpython> the song :-)
[01:36] <rc-1> alsea mixer giving right card now
[01:36] <dooglus> Q-FUNK: 'df' will report the space as being free as soon as it is free.  rebooting doesn't affect what df reports, unless it also affects how much space is free
[01:36] <netpython> rc-1, good chap
[01:37] <Q-FUNK> dooglus: I've had too many instances where deleting masses of files still doesn't report any space as freed to beleive that.
[01:37] <rc-1> i think i messed it up by having that on during install :(
[01:37] <zerosmoke> it's not mass...it's density
[01:38] <ulinskie> anybody got a good tutorial on scribus
[01:38] <zerosmoke> :D
[01:38] <christefano> thanks chuckyp
[01:38] <dooglus> Q-FUNK: if you delete a file which is open, then the space won't be freed until the file is closed.  but that's not df's fault.
[01:38] <doctorow> Q-FUNK It's still 100 percent
[01:38] <zerosmoke> geser beam
[01:38] <Q-FUNK> dooglus: that, I know.
[01:39] <zerosmoke> which file system?
[01:39] <phanter> when installing ubuntu-server, does the computer not support audio then (since it did work under ubuntu desktop)?
[01:39] <Q-FUNK> doctorow: hm.  does syslog show anything about e.g. the filesystem check having failed and root having been mounted as read-only?
[01:39] <dooglus> Q-FUNK: could it be the something is writing to the filesystem constantly, so as soon as you delete a file, the space gets used again?
[01:39] <zerosmoke> phanter, you installing it right on the drive or in a virtual drive?
[01:39] <dooglus> same question to doctorow...
[01:39] <phanter> zerosmoke: right on the drive
[01:39] <Q-FUNK> dooglus: that would be the case with e.g. syslog, yes
[01:40] <phanter> it replaced my old debian server (who had also perfect sound support)
[01:40] <doctorow> Q-FUNK dooglus Rebooting now -- I'll let you know in a sec
[01:40] <zerosmoke> not sure, phanter...any server xperts?
[01:41] <netpython> ulinskie, http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/Main_Page
[01:42] <rc-1> FIXED IT :))))) needed to enable digital outline jack, and god i think i busted my eardrums when i did
[01:42] <Daverocks> lol
[01:42] <Daverocks> congrats ^_^
[01:43] <doctorow> Q-FUNK What am I looking for in Syslog?
[01:43] <Q-FUNK> hm.
[01:45] <TheMutu> heyo
[01:45] <cpk1>  i have "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | sed -e 's/.*: //' | tail --lines=1" but want to take (r) out of the result as well how would i do this?
[01:47] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Is it worth fscking the disk?
[01:48] <nes_> what is this? apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[01:48] <BeanBag> what other music players (except for xmms) can i try that will be simular to Winamp5
[01:48] <deeem> nes_: use a FQDN instead, such as www.microsoft.com
[01:49] <nes_> hows that?
[01:49] <Paddy_EIRE> hey guys, I wish to download the edgy livecd iso... I have made a 2 gb ext3 partition to download to how can I mount this volume i think its hda3
[01:49] <neil__> deeem: nice example ;-)
[01:49] <defrysk> BeanBag, beep-media-player and amarok in player only mode
[01:49] <Przemcio78> is it worth switching to edzio?
[01:49] <BeanBag> defrysk: thanks, will give it a try
[01:50] <neil__> Paddy_EIRE: mkdir /mnt/iso; mount -t ext3 /dev/hda3 /mnt/iso
[01:50] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Grepping syslog and syslog.0 for "full" "only" "mount" doesn't produce any clues
[01:50] <defrysk> Paddy_EIRE, mkdir <whatever>
[01:50] <nes_> deeem, what do u mean?
[01:50] <defrysk> mount /dev/dhwhatever <whatever>
[01:50] <BeanBag> another question, well 2 actually: 1. Is Defcon (the windows game) available for linux yet? and how and where can i get wine64bit on my pc?
[01:50] <defrysk> cd <whatever>
[01:50] <defrysk> and then download it
[01:51] <neil__> nes_: you've probably put a fully qualified domain name in ServerName but it can't be resolved locally or via DNS
[01:51] <nes_> how?
[01:54] <Q-FUNK> doctorow:  dmesg | less
[01:54] <XiXaQ> What is a layer-2 network?
[01:54] <Olathe> How do I ensure that Ubuntu is using SiS integrated video drivers ?
[01:54] <Przemcio78> is it worth switching to edgy?
[01:54] <neil__> nes_: if you have "SeverName www.mydomain.com" then "127.0.1.1 www.mydomain.com localhost" in /etc/hosts would be a start
[01:54] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Oki -- What should I look for?
[01:55] <neil__> nes_: but that's an illustrative hack only.
[01:55] <nes_> ok
[01:55] <Q-FUNK> doctorow:  filesystem chekcs that report a failure
[01:56] <dooglus> Olathe: check for 'Driver "sis"' in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:57] <doctorow> Q-FUNK Nothing interesting under "file" or "fail" or "check"
[01:57] <dooglus> doctorow: what are you trying to do?
[01:58] <Olathe> dooglus : It has Driver "vesa".  Should I edit it to have "sis" instead ?
[01:59] <fyrestrtr> cpk1: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | sed -e 's/.*: //' -e 's/(R)//g' | tail --lines=1
[01:59] <dooglus> Olathe: I have an SiS video card.  I've copied my xorg.conf here: http://s89213869.onlinehome.us/xorg.conf
[01:59] <doctorow> dooglus When I woke up this morning /dev/sd1 was 100 percent full -- when I rebooted, it wouldn't boot
[01:59] <doctorow> dooglus So now I'm trying to figure it out
[02:00] <dooglus> doctorow: what is /dev/sd1?
[02:00] <ruschi> Hi guys, is it ok, i.e. the good practise to comment out the lines of the modules I don't want to load at boottime in /etc/modprobe.d/aliases ?
[02:00] <doctorow> dooglus Sorry, /dev/sda1 -- according to df, that's /
[02:01] <Olathe> dooglus : Alright.  Thanks :)
[02:01] <ruschi> for example I don't want joydev to be loaded in my kernel
[02:01] <fyrestrtr> ruschi: better to blacklist it.
[02:01] <ruschi> but this module is loaded at boottime
[02:01] <ruschi> ok, how do I do it
[02:01] <fyrestrtr> !blacklist
[02:01] <ubotu> To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add "blacklist modulename" to the end of that list
[02:01] <dooglus> doctorow: ok.  how about running this to list all recent big files?    sudo find / -xdev -type f -size +1M -mtime -1 -exec ls -ld {} ';'
[02:02] <ruschi> cool, I will do that
[02:02] <ruschi> thanks
[02:03] <doctorow> dooglus It lists pkgcache.bin, slocate.db, messages.0, kern.log.0
[02:03] <dooglus> doctorow: and that's all?
[02:03] <doctorow> dooglus The big one (4982349) is slocate.db
[02:03] <doctorow> dooglus Yes
[02:04] <dooglus> doctorow: that's only 4MB.  how big is the partition?
[02:04] <doctorow> dooglus df says it's 10080488
[02:04] <dooglus> doctorow: "df -h /" will show it in a human-readable form
[02:04] <cpk1> fyrestrtr: thanks! i will try that
[02:05] <doctorow> dooglus It's 9.7G, used 9.4G, but use% = 100
[02:05] <MM2> ubuntu won't see my usb kbd nor mouse (HP wireless). What to do?
=== schwarzesschaaf is now known as Schwarzesschaaf
[02:06] <cpk1> fyrestrtr: great it worked thank you very much
[02:06] <dooglus> doctorow: ok, so do a       sudo du -m / | grep '^[0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] '
[02:06] <dooglus> doctorow: that'll list all the directories which use more than 1GB
[02:07] <Director> I have one problem with my live cd with the Kubuntu Linux 6.06. It never start the cdrom when the computer iniciate. I already create a diskette with the boot menu but when i select the cd it give me a error. What can i do?
[02:07] <doctorow> dooglus That's a HUGE list -- like 40 screens
[02:07] <doctorow> dooglus wait, no, I mistyped
[02:09] <doctorow> dooglus OK, I may have it. I usually have a second internal HDD mounted -- though I never got it to work right, I can't cd to it -- that I tried setting up a daily backup to a couple days ago
[02:09] <doctorow> dooglus Ysterday I removed the disk, and I think the backup ran
[02:09] <dooglus> doctorow: ok, so the backup filled up the disk instead of writing to the other disk
[02:09] <doctorow> dooglus Wait wait no
[02:10] <dings> What could be the reason for 'ssh -X' not setting DISPLAY?
[02:10] <doctorow> dooglus Just looked at the partial backup I see from your last command -- it's only 4MB
[02:10] <doctorow> dooglus False alarm
[02:10] <chuckyp> dings, you need to enable another Xserver for ssh
[02:10] <doctorow> dooglus The list of the large dirs doesn't turn up much of anything
[02:11] <dooglus> doctorow: what about doing this?  echo $(sudo du -m / | sort -n | tail -n 5)
[02:11] <dooglus> doctorow: that'll print the 5 biggest directories on one line, suitable for pasting here.
[02:11] <ruschi> is there a easy way to find out what a certain module is good for?
[02:12] <ruschi> like I have no idea whether I need 'af_packet'
[02:12] <dings> chuckyp: not sure I got that. I have a client with X.org running and a server with X11forwarding. But "client> ssh -X me@server" does not set DISPLAY on the server.
[02:12] <chuckyp> dings, actually enable X forwarding on the server.
[02:12] <ruschi> I doubt it
[02:12] <chuckyp> hrm..
[02:12] <Director> I have one problem with my live cd with the Kubuntu Linux 6.06. It never start the cdrom when the computer iniciate. I already create a diskette with the boot menu but when i select the cd it give me a error. What can i do?
[02:12] <doctorow> dooglus I'm actually using a different machine for IRC, so I can't paste (the broken machine has no network access). But I ran the cmd and the only things it found were some of my music directories in /home
[02:12] <dooglus> doctorow: what numbers do you see?
[02:13] <chuckyp> dings, just make sure you edit etc/ssh/sshd_config  and X forwarding is enabled on the server.  Then maybe try "ssh -X -2 username@server"
[02:13] <doctorow> dooglus /home/doctorow/Music/audiobooks 41061 /home/doctorow/Music 65614 /home/doctorow/65623 /home 75070 /
[02:13] <dings> chuckyp: It is and I only allow -2.
[02:13] <coz_> is there a way to remove an entry in the "open with" menu?
[02:14] <chuckyp> dings, try xhost + on the server and try it again.
[02:14] <doctorow> dooglus But /home is on sda3, not sda1
[02:14] <dings> chuckyp: eh.. suddenly realised that I probably need some x.org packages on the server
[02:14] <chuckyp> dings, I mean on yoru system
[02:14] <dings> chuckyp: Im not about to open X on my system
[02:15] <chuckyp> dings, yeah lol you need those.  But if you get a cannot display error you can try "xhost +" to release the local box.
[02:15] <allen> wow...
[02:15] <dooglus> doctorow: grrr.
[02:15] <allen> Ubuntu is the sexiest operating system ever
[02:15] <dings> chuckyp: that is not an option
[02:15] <doctorow> dooglus Tell me about it! I'm really getting desperate
[02:15] <doctorow> dooglus I can't afford to be offline today
[02:15] <chuckyp> dings, well you need x packages on the server
[02:15] <ruschi> How do I find out what a module is basically good for?
[02:16] <dings> chuckyp: remember wich, I shouldn't need to acctually run an xserver.
[02:16] <dooglus> doctorow: ok...     echo $(sudo du -mx / | sort -n | tail -n 5)
[02:16] <dooglus> doctorow: the -x will stop it looking at other partitions
[02:16] <chuckyp> dings, No you don't actually need to run X but you need the X environment on the server.  Just don't launch it.
[02:17] <doctorow> dooglus "419 /usr/local 1454 /usr/lib 1844 /usr/share 408 /usr 4575 /"
[02:17] <chuckyp> ruschi, what are you trying to do exactly?
[02:17] <dooglus> doctorow: you typoed?
[02:17] <dings> chuckyp: isn't there some "-xorg-common" or something that would be enough?
[02:17] <chuckyp> dings, there should be let me check
[02:17] <ayaa> i have a message like this: xserver-xorg: failed to load bitmap module,how to know wich package does provide that module ?
[02:17] <ruschi> I have a default kernel, I used to have a homebrew with almost everything I need statically compiled in
[02:18] <ruschi> now I use the distrokernel because it ist really good
[02:18] <chuckyp> !info xorg > dings
[02:18] <ubotu> xorg: X.Org X Window System. In component main, is optional. Version 1:7.1.1ubuntu6 (edgy), package size 17 kB, installed size 44 kB
[02:18] <ruschi> unfortunately it loads tons of modules I don't need
[02:18] <ruschi> like sony_acpi
[02:18] <doctorow> dooglus No, I don't think so
[02:18] <doctorow> dooglus Just double-checked
[02:18] <ruschi> so I blacklist these modules
[02:18] <Khamael> no one answered in ubuntu-xgl. shouldn`t it be safe to run the official nvidia drivers with beryl on edgy now? my beryl-manager freezes xorg
[02:18] <dooglus> doctorow: you used "sort -n" in there?
[02:18] <chuckyp> ruschi, You want to list the modules?  lsmod?
[02:18] <ruschi> but some modules I don't know wheter I need them or not
[02:19] <ruschi> I list them
[02:19] <ruschi> I know
[02:19] <dooglus> doctorow: if so, the numbers should be in ascending order.
[02:19] <chuckyp> Khamael, well beryl is still not stable.
[02:19] <ruschi> all I want to know is what this modules does
[02:19] <chuckyp> ruschi, what is the name of it?
[02:19] <ruschi> like ipv6 -- enabes the ipv6 stack
[02:19] <JuJuBee> I want to build a new computer, but want to use officially supported hardware.  Where Can I look up supported hardware like Mobo's, video cards etc...
[02:19] <Khamael> chuckyp: i see. the thing is, it worked perfectly with the nvidia beta drivers
[02:19] <ruschi> ibm-acpi -- provides acpi for ibm thinkpads
[02:19] <chuckyp> JuJuBee, google for linuxcompatible
[02:20] <thevenin_> window 2
[02:20] <ruschi> Is there a generic way to find out what a modules namdd xy does?
[02:20] <chuckyp> Khamael, I know there are issues with beryl and the latest release of the envy drivers.
[02:20] <thevenin_> whoops, sorry
[02:20] <chuckyp> ruschi, google.
[02:20] <doctorow> dooglus I've triple-checked it and I think I got it right -- maybe you typoed? I have "echo $(sudo du -mx / | sort -n | tail -n 5)
[02:20] <ruschi> the modules I wonder about is tc1100_wmi
[02:20] <ruschi> ok
[02:21] <ruschi> google is always a good friend but I was wondering whether there is a dokumentation on the system
[02:21] <dooglus> doctorow: "1844 /usr/share 408 /usr 4575 /"?  the 408 should be bigger than the 1844...
[02:21] <chuckyp> ruschi, i'm checking now but I dont' see anythign
[02:21] <Khamael> chuckyp: how do I check what release I have? it just removed nvidia-glx with dist-upgrade, and installed a new nvidia driver after a "apt-get install nividia-glx"
[02:22] <chuckyp> ruschi, /usr/share/doc  somewhere maybe
[02:22] <Khamael> chuckyp: and everything seems to work, apart from beryl-manager
=== test3421 is now known as test3422
[02:22] <chuckyp> Khamael, cat /etc/issue  i think
[02:22] <doctorow> dooglus Ah, I typoed with the output, sorry: "419 /usr/local 1454 /usr/lib 1844 /usr/share 4058 /usr 4575 /"
[02:22] <dooglus> doctorow: either way, this is suggesting that you have less than 5GB used on that partition.  yet 'df -h /' tells you you're using more?
[02:22] <doctorow> dooglus Yes
[02:22] <ruschi> well modprobe.d/aliases is not too bad
[02:22] <dooglus> doctorow: and you ran some kind of fsck to check it?
[02:23] <doctorow> dooglus No -- I don't really know how to use fsck
[02:23] <Director> I have one problem with my live cd with the Kubuntu Linux 6.06. It never start the cdrom when the computer iniciate. I already create a diskette with the boot menu but when i select the cd it give me a error. What can i do?
[02:23] <Khamael> chuckyp: that just says ubuntu 6.10
[02:23] <geokok> I need a command to check the filesystemm for errors
[02:23] <dooglus> doctorow: the fact that it says it's 100% full when it's only 97% full is to do with ext3 saving some 5% or so exclusively for root access, but that's not the only problem here
[02:23] <chuckyp> Khamael, you are running edgy
[02:23] <doctorow> dooglus Can you walk me through a fsck maybe?
[02:23] <chuckyp> Khamael, 6.10 is the version of hte distro you are running.
[02:24] <Khamael> chuckyp: I meant what nvidia release. I guess envy was a typo?
[02:24] <chuckyp> Khamael, oh you mena which version of nvidia
[02:24] <dope> what's the best webcam program?
[02:24] <chuckyp> Khamael, do you have hte current one from the repos?
[02:24] <dooglus> doctorow: me neither, sorry.  I would guess it's a "sudo fsck.ext3 /dev/sda1" but you probably want something safer than my guesses when it comes to an operation like this...
[02:24] <chuckyp> Khamael, if so you can apt-cache showpkg nvidia-glx
[02:24] <geokok> What command can sheck the filesystem for errors?
[02:24] <dcordes> yea
[02:24] <dope> anyone? best webcame program?
[02:25] <dope> can i access a webcam remotely?
[02:25] <dooglus> doctorow: you probably have to boot from a live CD or something, because fsck won't work if the partition is mounted.
[02:25] <neil__> geokok: fsck
[02:25] <geokok> thanks
=== NET||abuse__ is now known as NET||abuse

[02:26] <geokok> neil_: I cant run it cause it says the filsesystem is mounted....
[02:26] <dooglus> doctorow: you can "man fsck.ext3" and "man fsck" to see more
[02:26] <chuckyp> CarinArr, are you getting an error?
[02:26] <dooglus> doctorow: I'll brb in 5 or 10 minutes
[02:26] <doctorow> dooglus Thanks
[02:26] <dcordes> geokok: umount it then
[02:26] <chuckyp> CarinArr, possibly try aptitude   its better than apt-get atleast at handling dependencies.
[02:26] <CarinArr> chuckyp, no, it just hangs, using edgy
[02:27] <chuckyp> CarinArr, does it hang at the same place every time?
[02:27] <geokok> but its my root partition....can i do that? and if yes can it be done with one command for the current session only?
[02:27] <neil__> geokok: try fsck -N
[02:27] <CarinArr> chuckyp, sometimes it installs/uninstalls, but this is with lots of different packages.. not the same one
[02:27] <dcordes> neil__: is there a way to check fat32 systems?
[02:28] <dcordes> or even ntfs
[02:28] <CarinArr> it's always at "setting up xxxx..." or "removing xxxx... "
[02:29] <lastnode> is there anyway i can extract a .deb from a package that is already installed in the system?
[02:29] <neil__> dcordes: you can check vfat certainly. i think you might need to install utilities to work with ntfs
[02:29] <lastnode> for example, i have w32codecs installed on dapper, i want to extract the .deb to install on edgy (the dl site is being really slow)
[02:29] <dcordes> how can i check vfat systems?
[02:30] <neil__> you can use /sbin/fsck.vfat
[02:31] <CarinArr> chuckyp, aptitude hangs as well
[02:31] <Khamael> chuckyp: is there a way to check if my nvidia card works like it should?
[02:31] <chuckyp> CarinArr, hrm... thats wierd

[02:32] <CheshireViking> Hi, what is a good mp3 tagger that will let me name mp3's and rename the files themselves  based on the tag's? I used to use musicmatch on windows, so something comparable to that, I've tried rythembox, but that doesn't seem to let me work on whole directory at once
[02:32] <CarinArr> it's a completely fresh install bar LDAP installed/configured for /home/
[02:32] <dings> chuckyp: no, I can't believe I need to have an xserver installed to provide x-forwarding. Are you sure? shouldn't it be enough with what on Debian would be xlibs?
[02:32] <Khamael> CheshireViking: try easytag
[02:32] <chuckyp> Khamael, like a 3d test or something?  What sort of issue are you having.
[02:32] <chuckyp> dings, whats the point of x forwarding if you have nothing to forward?
[02:33] <CheshireViking> khamael: Thanks, i'll give it a go

[02:33] <dings> chuckyp: I will have X applications forwarded to my local x-server
[02:33] <Khamael> chuckyp: haven`t tested all that much, but my problem is that beryl-manager freezes my xorg
[02:33] <freeomen> what's the deal?
[02:33] <CarinArr> chuckyp, it's not taking up cpu, just seems to be sat there waiting.. strace seems to show different things from one run to the next.. a lot of the time it hangs while waiting for whatever pid, the next it just says resource busy etc
[02:33] <chuckyp> dings, the server needs to be able to launch the x apps.
[02:33] <ailean> Lahey, u there?

[02:45] <freeomen> chuckyp, i don't disagree that it's the best.. i was talking about stability
[02:45] <allen> hmmm this is weird
[02:45] <rjgonza> yea Synaptic is great
[02:45] <phaedrus44> synaptic is too big
[02:45] <neil__> dcordes: i use gcj/gij and gcjwebplugin
[02:45] <ailean> Lahey, how'd you get on?
[02:46] <freeomen> chuckyp, in the forums, there are many post about people who had troubles
[02:46] <LockUp> Supports OOo PDF/X-1a format (not PDF)?
[02:46] <freeomen> http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=9636722
[02:46] <allen> woah
[02:46] <allen> i will use konversation
[02:46] <allen> its showing
[02:46] <allen> thanks chucky
[02:46] <chuckyp> freeomen, There are no stability problems with Dapper.  Edgy on the other hand is just that Edgy  mroe cutting edge software.
[02:46] <rjgonza> and you could always just install something like Automatix if you need to install something and don't know how to use synaptic - http://www.getautomatix.com/
[02:46] <phaedrus44> dont know how to use synaptic?  heh
[02:46] <phaedrus44> hehe
[02:47] <ailean> !automatix
[02:47] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[02:47] <defrysk> not automatix
[02:47] <dcordes> neil__: uninstall jre then?
[02:47] <defrysk> !automatix
[02:47] <rjgonza> oo sry bout that
[02:47] <phaedrus44> automatix is not good
[02:47] <rjgonza> I never used it, just heard good things
[02:47] <scena> wow, ive always had good luck w automatix
[02:47] <rjgonza> see
[02:47] <defrysk> rjgonza, its not good so please dont advise it here
[02:47] <chuckyp> freeomen, have you read any of the posts?  Most of those where caused by people interupting the package manager/ user error
[02:47] <scena> that doesnt mean thats true for everyone
[02:47] <ailean> scena, it does what it promises. it's just when you want to do further things, it can muck some stuff up
[02:47] <Poromenos> can someone help me with some ssh tunneling?
[02:47] <scena> o hi wouldnt doubt it
[02:48] <chuckyp> freeomen, just use aptitude or synaptic and all will be good.
[02:48] <ailean> Lahey, you still there? how did you get on with installing ubuntu?
[02:48] <chuckyp> !ssh > Poromenos
[02:48] <compengi> does ubuntu supports plotter printers?
[02:48] <phaedrus44> use apt
[02:48] <Lahey> ailean: I DL the desktop cd and tried it out, i love it. Im going to install it on a second HD when i get back from school today
[02:48] <ailean> Lahey, cool, good luck
[02:48] <scena> ive been converting Windows users to Ubuntu for three months
[02:48] <Poromenos> chuckyp: i actually need the setup :P
[02:48] <freeomen> chuckyp, hmm, i didn't read them but when i saw it was common, i started thinkin maybe the PM is the problem
[02:48] <rjgonza> Does anyone know of an application for developing Flash animation, or actionscript in Ubuntu?
[02:49] <freeomen> i've been using synaptic, add/remove, apt-get
[02:49] <freeomen> installing programs couldn't be easier
[02:49] <ailean> This chart shows Ubuntu getting more popular: http://www.google.com/trends?q=ubuntu
[02:49] <chuckyp> freeomen, Have you had any problems?
[02:49] <Lahey> ailean: Thanks again for all your help, cant wait to get home and play with it some more
[02:49] <neil__> dcordes: i wouldn't. you should be able to find a browser plugin for jre
[02:49] <dcordes> neil__: i install the packages you said and java still doesn't work
[02:49] <freeomen> but stability must be taken into consideration
[02:49] <scena> have any of you set up Ubuntu to act as a print server for Windows clients *without* using Samba
[02:49] <rjgonza> why without?
[02:49] <freeomen> chuckyp, yeah.. the things i was using don't work anymore
[02:49] <Poromenos> any good documents on SSH port forwarding, then?
[02:49] <CarinArr> sorry to repeat myself, but i'm having problems with package management.. when i try to install stuff it hangs, when i try to uninstall it hangs again.. for example i try to install fluxbox and it hangs at "Setting up fluxbox..." in the end I have to kill it, and when trying to remove it it hangs at "Removing fluxbox... " this is happening with lots of different packages, not just fluxbox.. example: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30743/
[02:49] <neil__> dcordes: what does about:plugins show in firefox?
[02:49] <freeomen> when i click on synaptic or add/remove, nothing shows up
[02:49] <ailean> Lahey, do you know how to send messages to individual people?
[02:49] <rjgonza> c ya guys later
[02:49] <chuckyp> freeomen, Are you running edgy?
[02:50] <scena> rj: well 1, ive never been able to get samba/swat to work
[02:50] <scena> rj: 2, ive also got to support somt legacy Unix systems that need to print to these servers as well
[02:50] <dcordes> neil__: Flash and Default
[02:50] <chuckyp> freeomen, perhaps you have a hung process?  Did you try looking at ps aux  or system monitor to see if there is a hung pid
[02:50] <scena> currently, ive got Mandriva print servers using CUPS-LPD
[02:50] <freeomen> ubuntu LTS 6.06
[02:50] <akpowar> 
[02:50] <scena> so Windows & Unix print to it via LPR
[02:50] <freeomen> chuckyp, no.. but it happens even when i restart the computer
[02:51] <Lahey> ailean: No it wont let me type in the window when you pm me
[02:51] <scena> i need to keep the LPR support & find a nicer way to let Window print to it
[02:51] <dcordes> neil__: libflashplayer.so libnullplugin.so
[02:51] <tdn> Is it possible to temporarily disable the shutdown/reboot funktionality from regular users in Ubuntu? I am asking this because I have some systems where I need to do some maintenance work. The users of these systems are allowed to use their workstations while I do the maintenance, but things will probably break if they were to shut down the system while I am running apt-get dist-upgrade or something like that.
[02:51] <chuckyp> freeomen, well have you checked logs?  To see what is happening?  or top to see if the process is actually running.
[02:51] <freeomen> chuckyp, did you get any problems at all?
[02:51] <ailean> compengi, check out http://www.linuxprinting.org/
[02:51] <akpowar> YW1lcmljYW4gRnVsbFM=
[02:51] <chuckyp> tdn, they shouldn't be able to .  Unless you gave them priveleges to do so.
[02:52] <freeomen> chuckyp, i didn't know there were logs
[02:52] <chuckyp> freeomen, I've never had a problem with apt-get or aptiude
[02:52] <neil__> dcordes: it might me some alternatives-related problem
[02:52] <chuckyp> freeomen, /var/log
[02:52] <freeomen> chuckyp, you're proving to me i'm dumb :P
[02:52] <dorto> anyone installed oracle express deb package on ubuntu?
[02:52] <chuckyp> freeomen, no  you aren't dumb
[02:52] <icelight> hey
[02:52] <chuckyp> dorto, no its never been done before.
[02:52] <freeomen> chuckyp, i didn't look anywhere or try to fix it
[02:53] <icelight> i need a good ftp client
[02:53] <dorto> chuckyp, by anyone?
[02:53] <freeomen> i'll try it again
[02:53] <chuckyp> icelight, ftp  in terminal
[02:53] <Lahey> ailean: This is what i get - Private messages from unregistered users are currently blocked due to spam problems, but you can always message a staffer. Please register!
[02:53] <chuckyp> dorto, i'm just messing with you.
[02:53] <neil__> dcordes: you could try dpkg-reconfigure gcjwebplugin
[02:53] <freeomen> thanx chuckyp :)
[02:53] <icelight> i mean in x-windows
[02:53] <icelight> i need a ftp client in x-winodws
[02:53] <ailean> Lahey, okay, you need a different chat program :) no matter, i'll get back in touch with you
[02:53] <chuckyp> freeomen, yeah check there and see if system monitor shows a process hugn like synaptic or update-manager  things of that sort.
[02:53] <tdn> chuckyp, they are allowed to shut down the computer via Gnome as regular users by default. This is a good feature because normally they need to be able to turn off the computer. But I just don't want them to do it while I am upgrading the system.
[02:53] <chuckyp> icelight, gftp
[02:53] <dorto> chuckyp, meh
[02:53] <rambo3>  how do i let qemu use actual network cards and no virtual net
[02:53] <chuckyp> icelight, firefox
[02:53] <icelight> firefo?
[02:54] <icelight> how to get it?
[02:54] <chuckyp> tdn, hrm...
[02:54] <scena> dammit, they say use Samba
[02:54] <scena> if i set CUPS up to share printers, can Windows use IPP?
[02:54] <chuckyp> icelight, firefox is your web browser ftp://123.123.123.123
[02:54] <dcordes> neil__: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gcjwebplugin    nothing happens when i issue this command
[02:55] <neil__> dcordes: that's ok
[02:55] <Lahey> ailean: i think i can fix it
[02:55] <icelight> ok
[02:55] <icelight>  i see
[02:55] <icelight> ty
[02:55] <dcordes> neil__: and it doesn't change anything

[02:57] <chuckyp> tdn, http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/03/20/disable-shutdown-for-normal-users/  possibly this may be of use.  You would have to undo what ever you do though to give them control back.

[02:57] <Alan-D> scena: Where is hte printer situated, on the Windows pc or Linux PC?
[02:57] <JuJuBee> after reading many reviews on linuxquestions.org about harware compatibility, I am more confused.  What Mobo works very well with ubuntu (planning on server)?
[02:58] <dcordes> gnomefreak: ? upda-alternatives: command not found
[02:58] <JuJuBee> Onboard video and sound would be fine.
[02:58] <tijn_tux> gnomefreak: maybe he has an keyboard error :D

[02:59] <dorto> is it known when skype will be added to edgy restricted repositories?
[02:59] <dcordes> it gives me the option to chose between 5 alternatives

[03:00] <chuckyp> igor, you could always install kate and continue to use that.
[03:00] <neil__> gnomefreak: a troll or someone who doesn't know how to configure his locale? :)

[03:01] <chuckyp> dope, is it an x program?
[03:01] <gnomefreak> type 3 than enter now ubuntu will use that one system wide
[03:01] <chuckyp> dope, i.e. a gui program?
[03:01] <dope> it's a command line program i think
[03:01] <neil__> dcordes: check about:plugins in firefox again
[03:01] <dope> no gui
[03:01] <chuckyp> dope, try killall motion
[03:01] <abes> and also Makefile.inc:89: *** /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-386/build is missing, please set KERNELPATH.  Stop.

[03:20] <Jimbo52> i suppose thats somehow the masterm altho it should be 115+
[03:21] <gnomefreak> dcordes: the ln -s command took all and tried to symlink them some already were there when you ran it the first time
[03:21] <Lahey> ailean: i think i fixed it, to sure till you say something.
[03:21] <dcordes> gnomefreak: -_- didn't work
[03:22] <Jimbo52> so, why wont it recognise both my drives and whats with the floppy, and floppy1?
[03:22] <jrib> Jimbo52: hmm I don't really know much about floppies, but if you post the contents of your '/etc/fstab' on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give the channel a link, someone might be able to help.  Also, open a terminal and type 'mount' without quotes and press enter, pastebin that as well
[03:22] <jokester> hey, anyone uses vpnc and can help me ?
[03:23] <Jimbo52> the problem isnt a floppy its the fact that it seems to falsly see more than one floppy, and doesnt see the second hard drive
[03:23] <ailean> Is there a list of people who would like discs anywhere? I know it takes a while to get them through shipit, but I'd be willing to send them out myself.
[03:23] <gnomefreak> dcordes: than im not sure if that was right directory to be cd'ed into. since you didnt do it in /opt/im not sure

[03:23] <jrib> Jimbo52: what filesystem is on the other drive's partition?
[03:24] <dcordes> gnomefreak: omg how can i get back to old ff den?
[03:24] <Jimbo52> ntfs
[03:24] <Jimbo52> other drive is ntfs
[03:24] <jrib> !ntfs | Jimbo52
[03:24] <ubotu> Jimbo52: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:25] <jrib> Jimbo52: note that you can only safely read from ntfs drives, writing is not recommended
[03:25] <gnomefreak> dcordes: you have to remove it see !firefox   and use the newversion link and how to remove is on there. just replace your directories with the ones they state

[03:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about will look in a minute - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:26] <jrib> ubotu: tell Jimbo52 about yourself
[03:26] <Jimbo52> it sees network drives on other machines that are ntfs but wont see the one on this machine??

[03:28] <alberto> hi
[03:28] <alberto> why there is no compiz for aixgl/xorg in edgy?
[03:28] <neil__> alberto: there is
[03:28] <jrib> !info compiz
[03:28] <ubotu> compiz: OpenGL composition manager - transitional package. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.0.13.38-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 25 kB, installed size 64 kB
[03:28] <alberto> No, but that version is for XGL
=== joelliot is now known as satshen
[03:28] <alberto> Not for aixgl.
[03:29] <gnomefreak> alberto: join #ubuntu-xgl  you can run compiz on edgy just fine beryl works better IMHO though
[03:29] <neil__> alberto: it works with aiglx in xorg
[03:29] <alberto> I done like beryl.
[03:29] <alberto> I like freedesktop standars, beryl not.
[03:29] <alberto> neil__: Yes, I know, but not edgy one.
[03:29] <alberto> neil__: http://gandalfn.wordpress.com/howto/howto-compiz-aiglx-on-edgy/
[03:30] <gnomefreak> alberto: ask in #ubuntu-xgl. also the /topic in there has guides
[03:30] <alberto> gnomefreak: I dont use XGL, I use xorg.
[03:30] <atlas95> hello
[03:30] <atlas95> send to/ bluetooth in nautilus doesn't work, it finds any device
[03:30] <gnomefreak> alberto: topics related to compiz/xgl/beryl are offtopic for this channel
[03:30] <atlas95> someone could help me please?
[03:30] <alberto> gnomefreak: why?
[03:31] <alberto> gnomefreak: You speaked about beryl not me.
[03:31] <jrib> alberto: #ubuntu-xgl is the channel created for xgl, aiglx, compiz, beryl, and related
[03:31] <alberto> gnomefreak: I use xorg.
[03:31] <gnomefreak> alberto: because there is no direct support for them in ubuntu
[03:31] <alberto> gnomefreak: Are you a ubuntu worker?
[03:31] <gnomefreak> define worker?
[03:31] <summat> anywhere i can get the csm package? I cant install compiz on edgy because the csm package is needed for compiz-plugins and it cant be installed
[03:31] <alberto> gnomefreak: I DONT use beryl.
[03:31] <alberto> So stop.
[03:32] <alberto> No beryl no XGL.
[03:32] <alberto> I use Xorg.
[03:32] <alberto> And Xorg is supported by Ubuntu.
[03:32] <gnomefreak> alberto: than why did you ask about compiz
[03:32] <alberto> Xorg have aixgl inside. So if ubuntu support xorg support aixgl as well.

[03:33] <gnomefreak> alberto: aiglx does nothing on its own that you would beable to see.
[03:33] <igor> anybody knows a C channel?

[03:33] <neil__> alberto: if you install compiz-core, compiz-gnome and compiz-plugins that's all you need. it works with aiglx in xorg
[03:33] <alberto> neil__: No, it doesnt.
[03:33] <alberto> neil__: I did. :-)
[03:33] <igor> thanks
[03:33] <alberto> ?
[03:33] <gnomefreak> neil__: help him in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:34] <neil__> alberto: it works fine for my ATI-9200 based card. have you enabled composite in xorg.conf?
[03:34] <jrib> summat: are you trying to use compiz from the offcial ubuntu repositories?
[03:34] <alberto> neil__: I have compiz working here, not ubuntu official one.
[03:34] <gnomefreak> alberto: and neil__ join #ubuntu-xgl for help with compiz.

[03:35] <bjornolai> I'm having trouble installing the google toolbar on firefox 2.0 in edgy. Something about the build type?
[03:35] <Japsu> I'm having trouble connecting my Ubuntu laptop to my cell phone via Bluetooth. Currently I'm trying to do it manually: hcitool cc <bdaddr>; hcitool auth <bdaddr>, which responds with "HCI authentication request failed: Input/output error". Any insight on this?
[03:35] <Jimbo52> is 6.10 more problematic than 6.06?
[03:35] <Japsu> Actually it's Kubuntu Edgy.
[03:35] <Jimbo52> rb
[03:36] <pip> I heard that there is some kind of 3D desktopc program available ,right ?
[03:36] <pip> *desktop
[03:36] <phaedrus44> pip:   uh ...yeah
[03:36] <pip> phaedrus44, so what is its name and how can I get it
[03:36] <gnomefreak> jrib: iirc the official repos dont use csm yet
[03:37] <loutrine> pip: I think you're after XGL & Beryl, see here http://www.beryl-project.org/index.php
[03:37] <jrib> gnomefreak: yeah, that's what I believe as well
[03:37] <phaedrus44> pip:  which ubuntu you use?
[03:37] <phaedrus44> 6.06?
[03:37] <pip> loutrine, thanks
[03:37] <bjornolai> Anyone know why the google toolbar is not compatible with my Firefox build type (linux-gnu_x86-gcc3) ??
[03:37] <pip> phaedrus44, only ubuntu can use that ?
[03:37] <Jimbo52> is it a good idea to use Dapper Drake for ntfs writing support?
[03:37] <gnomefreak> bjornolai: they havent made a version for 2.0 yet
[03:37] <Jimbo52> first day on linux here
[03:38] <summat> jrib: just checked my sources.list, think its sorted now, there was an extra line when i tried beryl, its installed it now
[03:38] <phaedrus44> pip:  what?
[03:38] <pip> Jimbo52, : )
[03:38] <jrib> summat: great
[03:38] <gnomefreak> bjornolai: thats the only thing that would be the reason
[03:38] <bjornolai> gnomefreak: thanx :)
[03:38] <loutrine> pip: No probs :) I found a great guide for ati cards running ubuntu edgy if that would help
[03:38] <Jimbo52> i mean the ntfs fuse module
[03:38] <phaedrus44> check thiss out  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9JC5NQ7G0o
[03:38] <pip> phaedrus44, i want to ports it to other linux
[03:38] <Jimbo52> should i use the ntfs fuse module whatever that is
[03:38] <pip> *port
[03:39] <neil__> Jimbo52: first of many :)
[03:39] <Jimbo52> As of Ubuntu 6.04 (Dapper Drake) there is slightly more NTFS writing support
[03:39] <Jimbo52> through a very experimental NTFS FUSE module. Using this seems to work but
[03:39] <Jimbo52> is NOT recommended. Do you want to use this? [no] 
[03:39] <Jimbo52> leave it set at no??
[03:40] <gnomefreak> Jimbo52: might want to try a fuse channel. i dont recommend using it as it can hurt your system
[03:40] <jrib> Jimbo52: that depends on how much you value your data and whether or not you have backups.  _very experimental_ are the key words
[03:41] <oyvind> Anyone know how I can stop Evolution from creating a HTML-part in all my outgoing mail ? I _do_not_ want HTML to be part of the mails I send ... I can't figure out how to disable it

[03:42] <joelol75> Can anyone help me with Beryl in KDE.  It works, I just need a regular session and autoloading the beryl-manager crashes this.  I made a startup script .kde/Autostart/beryl to load it in, and used a if [$DISPLAY = ":1.0" ] ; then load statement but the script doesn't work... After KDE starts I can re-run the script and it works.... Is this a KDE prob (Too soon to check $DISPLAY) or is there a better condition to check?
[03:42] <Jimbo52> fat32??
[03:42] <gnomefreak> joelol75: try in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:42] <jrib> Jimbo52: ext3
[03:42] <Jimbo52> est3?
[03:42] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, just leave it at ntfs, read from it in linux, and get the windows ext3 drivers for when you have to boot into windows
[03:43] <joelol75> thanx
[03:43] <Jimbo52> i dont have windows on this machine any more
[03:43] <kmaynard> that's if the other partition is going to be a windows os...if it's just raw storage use ext3
[03:43] <chi-pandanIndah> need help. I am new at Ubuntu...my internet is not working when i re-start into livecd
[03:43] <Jimbo52> i have windows on another machine on this kvm switch
[03:43] <kmaynard> then use ext3
[03:43] <neil__> oyvind: Edit|Preferences|Composer Preferences|Default Behaviour and uncheck Format messages in HTML
[03:43] <Jimbo52> where do i find this ext3?
[03:43] <tim167> vlc plays an mp4 file but without sound, how do I fix this ?
[03:43] <kmaynard> chi-pandanIndah, wireless or wired?
[03:44] <oyvind> neil__: Thanks a lot :)
[03:44] <wijnand> why ext3 and why not reiserfs?
[03:44] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, how are you creating the filesystem? in the installer?
[03:44] <Jimbo52> or where do i change it?
[03:44] <kmaynard> wijnand, ext3 is a little more stable
[03:44] <wijnand> ah
[03:44] <Jimbo52> honestly i dont know what the hell im doing here :)
[03:44] <wijnand> never had issues with reiser, but then again neither with ext3 :)
[03:45] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, unmount it, mk2fs -j /dev/hdx
[03:45] <Jimbo52> first time i looked at this os
[03:45] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, google is your friend too
[03:45] <Jimbo52> yea i know
[03:45] <jrib> Jimbo52: install gparted if you want a nice gui interface
[03:45] <bjornolai> Jimbo52: gparted might be a good way to go
[03:45] <kmaynard> wijnand, i've never had a problem with reiser (use it on my server even tho i wanna switch it) but ive heard data loss stories...ext3 is pretty rock solid
[03:46] <oyvind> neil__: I already had that option turned off. The reason I got confused was that I noticed my saved drafts contained an HTML-part. However, this part disappeared when I actually sent the saved drafts, so no problem. Thanks for the help, anyway, it works as expected.
[03:47] <neil__> wijnand: I've had no problems with JFS or XFS. i'm presently using XFS
[03:47] <Jimbo52> maybe i s should go see if that script from that site made the drive accessable first

[03:48] <aro-ron> Hey all, anyone able to give me a hand with some video drivers?

Any tips? if not, I will just go with proprietary drivers
[03:48] <Guardian> hi
[03:48] <bjornolai> I can't get my mic to work in edgy. Bugs the hell out of me having to boot in to windows to talk to people. Anyone know anything about mics and edgy?
[03:49] <neil__> aro-ron: the oss ati drivers are in xorg
[03:49] <Jimbo52> dammit...drive is still not visible as far as i can see
[03:49] <kmaynard> bjornolai, check your volume control, make sure the mic isnt muted
[03:49] <Jimbo52> it should show under "computer" right?
[03:49] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, language
[03:49] <aro-ron> neil_ I know that, how do I get them to actually run?
[03:49] <Shi`Hao> hi, I have a Pentium 4 HT cpu and I saw a site stating that I've to use linux kernel i686 instead of 386, why is that??
[03:49] <Jimbo52> do i need to re install the os or what?
[03:50] <neil__> aro-ron: select ati in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:50] <morphycs> I disabled ipv6 as written in the ubuntuforums but when I check for that "ip a | grep inet6" I get output which means that ipv6 is active
[03:50] <kmaynard> Shi`Hao, you dont have to, but it will use both threads
[03:50] <kmaynard> Jimbo52, you need to do some googling and reading
[03:50] <dooglus> doctorow: any luck?
[03:50] <kmaynard> morphycs, did you reboot?
[03:51] <morphycs> kmaynard: sure
[03:51] <aro-ron> neil_: oh duh, thank you... time to get my glasses checked
[03:51] <bjornolai> I have checked every option in my alsa mixer gui. Tried using the alsa mixer from console, but I can't seem to get the mic volume up.
[03:51] <Jimbo52> well if this os was worth a sh*t it seems it should at least be able to recognise a freakin hard drive without taking a course to figure out why it wont
[03:51] <grout> im looking to buy a new mini pci wireless card for my dell because my old ones compatability sucks with linux, which card would you guys recoment
[03:51] <boink> pcmcia card?

[03:51] <grout> no mini pci
[03:52] <pppoe_dude> hi. ok, say i have a corrupt/unusable master boot record.... i.e. computer doesn't boot... NOW, if i install grub on it, will it autodetect which operating systems are on which partitions?
[03:53] <chi-pandanIndah> anyone know how come gaim is not working but the network (firefox) is working perferctly well?
[03:54] <abbyz> how do i change the screen resolution from the shell?
=== chi-pandanIndah is now known as New-Bee
[03:55] <wijnand> shell being console?
[03:55] <abbyz> yeah
[03:55] <dorto> pppoe_dude, try it; ubuntu should show the detected operating systems during installation of grub
[03:55] <wijnand> abbyz iirc that's a boot option
[03:55] <Jimbo52> when i use    for i in /dev/[hs] d[a-z] ; do sudo fdisk -l $i; done    i can see the drive in the terminal but not under "computer"
[03:56] <Jimbo52> hmm
[03:56] <pppoe_dude> dorto, i only want to install grub from livecd... there is no ubuntu installation on the computer...
[03:56] <bjornolai> Dooglus: In the "normal" volume control everything is on and up. But when i go in to the alsa mixer from console the mic is down and unmovable
[03:56] <abbyz> wijnand: so there's a way in which i can change that boot option?
[03:56] <pppoe_dude> dorto, this is for a friend... well, i guess another way to ask the question... if there's a windows installation, can i uze grub to boot into it? (this is purely diagnostic)
[03:57] <Gwildor> ya
[03:57] <dorto> pppoe_dude, yes, grub can boot into windows installation
[03:57] <loutrine> pppoe_dude: Can't you boot a windows cd and run a fixmbr or something...?
[03:57] <pppoe_dude> dorto, so it will autodetect it right? coz theres no /etc/menu.1st file or anything
[03:57] <dorto> pppoe_dude, you can do it from grub prompt itself even if there is no entry for windows in grub menu
[03:57] <pppoe_dude> dorto, do you have a handy command?
[03:57] <agent> anyone know why in bash, if i do for i in $FILE.... when $FILE=`cat file_with_multiple_lines`, the for statement does not iterate over every line? $i ends up being $FILE
[03:58] <dorto> pppoe_dude, no, you need to enter the partition number on which windows is installed
[03:58] <pppoe_dude> dorto, so... grub> 1 will boot /dev/hda1?
[03:58] <pppoe_dude> (in the prompt ofcourse...)
[03:58] <dooglus> bjornolai: there's a switch for which mic to use, too?
[03:59] <dorto> pppoe_dude, yeah, but I don't remember the exact procedure; my brother dictates me and I type it
[03:59] <dorto> but i have booted into windows from grub>

[04:12] <k31th> no it gets all the deps
[04:12] <k31th> hastesaver: so i can pull down all the deps for a package
[04:12] <LjL> Trixsey, there are a few "advanced calculators" for linux.
[04:12] <Trixsey> We use Solaris in school, and that is fts
[04:12] <surface> Trixsey: mac os is cool
[04:12] <crapz0r> oh rly?
[04:12] <Trixsey> LjL: This calculator is very specifically designed for one thing though.. calculating attacks in a game I play :P
[04:13] <hastesaver> k31th, that apt-get does by default
[04:13] <worldcitizen> hi can anyone help me in playing a video CD
[04:13] <LjL> !wine | Trixsey
[04:13] <ubotu> Trixsey: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:13] <sigger> Trixsey: like poker :-p
[04:13] <Trixsey> Compability layer.. as in emulator?
[04:13] <LjL> Trixsey: well, Wine means Wine Is Not an Emulator
=== surface is now known as geek00L[0] 
[04:13] <Trixsey> LOL :P
[04:13] <worldcitizen> I have installed ubantu from the ubuntu live CD and now the palyer does not pay the video cd.
[04:13] <hastesaver> k31th, "apt-get install <packagename>" (you can also use aptitude, or Synaptic, or Adept instead of apt-get) will automatically install that package and all its dependencies
[04:13] <genon> I have a slight problem getting the right Hz for my monitor, it's stuck on 60Hz, any ideas?
[04:13] <worldcitizen> The cd drive is mounted though
[04:13] <solevita> worldcitizen: get vlc player    that works
[04:13] <hastesaver> worldcitizen, is it a DVD?
[04:14] <wheelswitch> !aptitude
[04:14] <ubotu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[04:14] <cheesy> worldcitizen: join #ubantu
[04:14] <worldcitizen> no it's a cd
[04:14] <Trixsey> #2) Does DC++ run well on Ubuntu?
[04:14] <LjL> Trixsey, when people say "emulator", they usually mean something that simulates a computer architecture. WINE on the other hand just executes Windows binary files, and has a (mostly) Windows-compatible API. that's different
[04:14] <bjornolai> Can anyone tell me how to change the language of my ubuntu. He's speaking norwegian and that bugs me :)
[04:14] <dear_> Hello
[04:14] <Trixsey> LjL: is wine free?
[04:14] <LjL> Trixsey: wine is free, dc++ doesn't run at all on Ubuntu AFAIK, but there are alternatives
[04:15] <dear_> i want install Lanquage Thai
[04:15] <Trixsey> yeah fulDC and stuff, right?
[04:15] <agent> bjornolai: when you log in there is an option to change language (if you have it installed)
[04:15] <LjL> !info dcgui | Trixsey
[04:15] <wheelswitch> !thai
[04:15] <ubotu> dcgui: Direct Connect Graphical client (GTK+) (peer-based file-sharing). In component universe, is optional. Version 0.80-5 (edgy), package size 432 kB, installed size 1292 kB
[04:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thai - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:15] <Trixsey> oh yeah
[04:15] <Trixsey> dcqt and dcguiqt and stuff
[04:15] <dear_> !thai
[04:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thai - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:15] <dear_> Yes Thai
[04:16] <dear_> i want install Lanquage Thai  and Keyboard Thai
[04:16] <bjornolai> Agent: when I log in? U mean just before the splash
[04:16] <agent> bjornolai: if you need to install a language, go to system->administration->language support (thats in english - you will need to transalte into the current language)
[04:16] <wheelswitch> krap krap
[04:16] <hastesaver> worldcitizen, it *should* play by default, usually.
[04:16] <LjL> Trixsey: the current KDE one is called valknut actually, but anyway there are at least three or four different clients in the repos
[04:16] <hastesaver> !restricted | worldcitizen
[04:16] <ubotu> worldcitizen: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats

[04:16] <bjornolai> Thanx
[04:17] <genon> I can't seem to change my Hz for my monitor, any ideas?
[04:17] <dear_> Help Me
[04:17] <smartmovie> help you with what??
[04:17] <Trixsey> C++ only compiles to exe?
[04:17] <Trixsey> or what?
[04:17] <LjL> Trixsey: uh?
[04:17] <cheesy> smartmovie: (16:16:19) dear_: i want install Lanquage Thai  and Keyboard Thai
[04:17] <Trixsey> I figured since DC++ didn't run in Ubuntu
[04:17] <solevita> hi     does anybody know which plugin is responsible for live media in mozilla firefox?      the videos work, but there is no sound   for example at google.video
[04:17] <Trixsey> Because it's open source, so should be able to compile DC++ in Ubuntu?
[04:17] <LjL> Trixsey: ".exe", if that's what you mean, is just the extension Windows and other operating systems (not Ubuntu) use for executable programs
[04:18] <LjL> Trixsey: no.
[04:18] <LjL> Trixsey: the fact that it's open source doesn't mean you can take it and compile it unmodified on any system.
[04:18] <LjL> Trixsey: the Linux and Windows APIs are totally different. you'd have to rewrite it to work on Ubuntu
[04:18] <dear_> Help Me
[04:18] <dear_> i want install Lanquage Thai  and Keyboard Thai
[04:18] <wheelswitch> solevita:  that is a known problem, if you reset your x session, and do not open any apps which use your soundcard, it should work
[04:18] <Trixsey> ok
[04:18] <Trixsey> Java ftw :p
[04:19] <LjL> Trixsey: anyway, why don't you just try out the other clients we have?
[04:19] <ailean> guys, is there a way to help out shipit?
[04:19] <Syn_Flood> Hiya
[04:19] <Trixsey> I had ubuntu before, briefly
[04:19] <Trixsey> long ago
[04:19] <solevita> wheelswitch:  thanx!!  let's try it out
[04:19] <Trixsey> and I remember I couldn't get DC going
[04:19] <Syn_Flood> Can i ask a question about Evolution in there?
[04:19] <ifireball> anyone know if there is some kind of a spamblocker plugin for gaim?
[04:19] <genon> Where can I change the Hz for my monitor, if it isn't displayed in the Screen Resolutions
[04:20] <worldcitizen> ihave the totem media player installed but it does not play the vcd
[04:20] <loutrine> worldcitizen: sudo apt-get install vlc
[04:21] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell genon about fixres
[04:21] <ifireball> genon: Ubuntu ususally chooses the bes refresh rate possible, if you're not happy with the rate it chose, you can force it to ues a higer rate by telling it in xorg.conf that your screen does not support as low rate is is chose
[04:21] <ifireball> genon: however, messing with xorg and that level might cause your X not to load at all
[04:22] <sally2> how does one get the trask can back on the desktop gui?
[04:22] <Syn_Flood> I have evolution installed it has the exchange plugin installed as well (all by default install of Xubuntu) but exchange isn't showing up as a selectable server to use.
[04:22] <Syn_Flood> is this common?  i can't find anything on this type of a problem online anywhere
[04:23] <genon> ifireball: I think that it's stuck on 60Hz for some reason, kinda new to Ubuntu so I don't know what I am looking for in xorg that could change that
[04:23] <bjornolai> Is there anyway I can tell whether ubuntu has detected my microphone or not?
[04:23] <Syn_Flood> I've reinstalled Evolution as well hasn't fixed anything.  I'm new to Xubuntu so i could just be doing something wrong.  Any suggestions?
[04:23] <LjL> bjornolai: if it has detected your soundcard, it has detected your microphone.
=== crapz0r is now known as zomgkickbanmepls
[04:23] <ifireball> genon: I think someone already told ubotu to link you to a wiki page about all this, if not "/msg ubotu fixres"
[04:24] <bjornolai> oki
[04:25] <bjornolai> In Gnome Alsa Mixer i can only choose Rec on capture. Is this my mic? (sorry for my ignorance)
[04:25] <igor> is there any program similar to SuperKaramba to ubuntu ?
[04:26] <proppy> bug reported : https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cvs/+bug/71089
[04:26] <ifireball> igor: gdesklets, never tried it though so I can't gurantee quality...
[04:26] <LjL> !info kgrellm | igor
[04:27] <ubotu> Package kgrellm does not exist in any distro I know
[04:27] <LjL> err, gkrellm
[04:27] <ifireball> LjL: that's not quite what superkaramba does
[04:28] <Syn_Flood> anyone have any suggestions? :)
[04:28] <Trixsey> #4) What made you choose Ubuntu over other unix distributions?
[04:28] <LjL> ifireball: dunno, i've used neither. but superkaramba has shiny applets for the desktop, and gkrellm has shiny applets for the desktop...
[04:28] <loutrine> Trixsey: Community (support), debian based (apt-get) and all the cool kids were doing it :p
[04:28] <dorto> yeah, gdesklet is prone to crashes, not all desklets, but some
[04:28] <worldcitizen> loutrine, how do u install a package in ubuntu
[04:29] <dave_> anyone know if its possible to run fglrx and nvidia-glx kernel sources on the same machine? apt only wants one or the other
[04:29] <worldcitizen> i have searched the site for ubuntu vlc
[04:29] <loutrine> worldcitizen: sudo apt-get install foo
[04:29] <dave_> ive got two video cards, one of each
[04:29] <worldcitizen> it can be downloaded but there are so many versions
[04:29] <Juhaz> there's also adesklets, which should be desktop-agnostic
[04:29] <Fallen_Angel> Hey can someone help me with my ubuntu ???
[04:29] <loutrine> worldcitizen: open up a terminal and type sudo apt-get install vlc
[04:29] <Homie> hello
[04:29] <solevita> wheelswitch:  IT WORKED!!   thank you    *kiss*
[04:29] <Fallen_Angel> i have a problem with apache2 php5 with charsets
[04:29] <LjL> Trixsey: i ruled out anything that didn't use APT, since i was already so used to it on Debian and liked it. Ubuntu was the most obious choice for a desktop computer. anyway, i think this is not a support question and should be taken to #ubuntu-offtopic instead
[04:29] <Fallen_Angel> :(
[04:30] <Homie> is it possible to open passworded rar files under ubuntu without password?
[04:30] <ifireball> LjL: afaik gkrellm is just one ugly horizontal bar full of system meters, not quite up to pare with SuperKramba, but actually KDE guys began to write SuperKaramba becasue they envied gdesklets...
[04:30] <Alakazamz0r> How can i get the latest nvidia drivers from nvidia's screen resolution to change

=== geek00L[no-batte is now known as geek00L[6] 
[04:30] <Syn_Flood> is there a chat room for evolution issues?

[04:32] <Syn_Flood> my text is grey am i actually posting in the channel?
[04:32] <wheelswitch> solevita:  no worries
[04:33] <wheelswitch> Syn_Flood:  yes
[04:33] <loutrine> Syn_Flood: Yes, I can read your messages fine :)
[04:33] <Syn_Flood> sweet
[04:33] <Syn_Flood> just making sure :)
[04:33] <LjL> Trixsey, a release comes out every 6 months. meanwhile, packages are *not* updated, i.e. you won't get new versions. the only updates you get are fixes to security vulnerabilities and to very serious bugs
[04:34] <Syn_Flood> I'm not a complete noob but I get frustrated easy with linux :)
[04:34] <worldcitizen>  i have got gnome-vlc_0.8.5-svn20060208-1ubuntu1_i386.  What does one do install it? just double click?
[04:34] <LjL> Trixsey, then there is an (unsupported) "backports" repository where some packages from the next (development) version are ported back to the current version. but only a few packages end up there
[04:34] <dave_> anyone know if its possible to run fglrx and nvidia-glx kernel sources on the same machine? apt only wants one or the other
[04:35] <Alakazamz0r> anyone?
[04:35] <Alakazamz0r> ive even removed all modes except 1024x768, and its still 800x600
[04:35] <Alakazamz0r> its like xorg isnt reading my monitors sync ranges.
[04:35] <LjL> Alakazamz0r: run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and take care to select the right monitor parameters
[04:35] <wheelswitch> is there a quick command to display system details, ie cpu, hdd, ram etc?
[04:35] <Alakazamz0r> i just did that.
[04:35] <Syn_Flood> Alakazamz0r, it might be that your driver is only supporting 800x600?
[04:35] <Alakazamz0r> i even went into advanced settings LjL
[04:36] <Alakazamz0r> Syn_Flood, i downloaded/installed it from nvidia.com
[04:36] <dave_> what driver are you using?
[04:36] <zomgkickbanmepls> LOL JEWS

[04:37] <Alakazamz0r> yeah dave_
[04:37] <hastesaver> LjL, ok. Because I came here sometime earlier in the day and I saw something similar happen... the price of popularity, I guess
[04:37] <dave_> what driver are you using?
[04:37] <Alakazamz0r> this is my monitor http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/p780/
[04:37] <dave_> nv or nvidia?

[04:50] <abes> ok i have vlc - where can i get codecs?
[04:50] <thijs>  8-)
[04:50] <LjL> leafw: that's xserver-xorg, and it won't remove much i'm afraid
[04:50] <leafw> LjL : with autoremove it will, for those packages were indirectly isntalled
[04:50] <LjL> thijs: perhaps if you want a server install, you could use the server version
[04:50] <thijs> ow oke
[04:50] <thijs> very tnx
[04:51] <LjL> leafw, i'm not going to try that, but i doubt it... removing ubuntu-desktop won't make autoremove remove anything else
[04:51] <matiit> cze
[04:51] <LjL> the packages that are installed by default aren't marked as autoremovable, otherwise it'd be a mess

[04:52] <ubotu> thijs: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[04:52] <leafw> LjL, thijs : to ensure the shot, do a dpkg-quer -W --showformat='${Package}\t${Status}\n' | grep "ok installed" | grep "xserver" | less
[04:52] <thijs> sorry
[04:52] <leafw> and then remove whatever is there with apt-get.

[04:54] <xgm> Hello, is there any tool in 6.06 or 6.10 (except firestarter) to share internet connection from eth0 to eth1 ? I got my connection from router to eth0 by cable, and i want to make connection sharing like in windows, to share connection from 1 lan card to another, becouze im using 2 computers and they are connected by cables, sorry for my english :P
[04:54] <Toma-> slight: ask on launchpad
[04:54] <Alakazamz0r> and im @ 800x600@50hz
[04:54] <Alakazamz0r> weird? i think so.
[04:54] <Toma-> slight: or, file a bug against gnome-terminal and someone will a assign it to the proper place
[04:54] <slight> Toma-, #launchpad?
[04:54] <Toma-> slight: google: launchpad ;D
[04:54] <ifireball> Alakazamz0r: any hints on the log file?
[04:55] <LjL> Alakazamz0r: i think so too, and i'm not sure what to try
[04:55] <slight> i know launchpad, but there's an awful lot of it
[04:55] <dorto> xgm: can't you share through your router?
[04:55] <Alakazamz0r> let me check ifireball
[04:55] <slight> what do you mean by 'ask on launchpad'
[04:55] <xgm> dorto: no
[04:55] <dorto> xgm: connect internet to router; then connect all the computers to that router
[04:55] <timhaughton> I've got an archive split using WinRar, so I've got .r00, .r01 .r02 files etc. How can I recombine the archives in Edgy?
[04:55] <Toma-> slight: theres a support box you can ask it
[04:55] <xgm> I want to make connection sharing thru lan cards
[04:55] <slight> Toma-, right thanks
[04:55] <xgm> dorto: its impossible, all slots are used
[04:55] <Toma-> np
[04:56] <abes> supposingly i have Ogg Theora installed, but I still cant play movies - what can it be?
[04:56] <xgm> and I want to share connection by lan cards
[04:56] <dorto> xgm: connect a hub or a switch into one slot on the router, then connect more computers to the hub/switch
[04:56] <dorto> xgm: you can share the connection from a gnu/linux box using iptables
[04:56] <preaction> timhaughton, you don't need to "recombine" them, when they're extracted it will Just Work

[05:06] <Subhuman> i mean, if you need a server, you should know how to admin one on the CLI - phpmyadmin is a ncie web based mysql admin app.

[05:10] <Riot777> in your / root dir
[05:11] <rc55> Riot777: I'll just boot it, it's a VM

[05:24] <netpython> just checking
[05:24] <CarinArr> ia-outdoors, basically i was looking at several guides and for troubleshooting with my problems all said "try recompiling"
[05:24] <IA-Outdoors> well, I guess I'll try doing that then
[05:24] <CarinArr> it was very straightforward to compile tho
[05:24] <feihung> jrib yeah it's working the file is there but I can not copy and paste to this drive ??? what is touch
[05:24] <smartmovie> offline !
[05:24] <Hattori> !usb
[05:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:25] <Hattori> how to access to usb?
[05:25] <Hattori> from terminal
[05:25] <jrib> feihung: touch creates a blank file among other things.  Are you trying to copy to a subdirectory or something?
[05:25] <cherubiel> Hattori: most usb devices are emulated as scsi, try mounting sda1 etc
[05:25] <feihung> I just copy one text file to there
[05:26] <jrib> feihung: it should work, paste the output
[05:26] <Hattori> cherubiel: can you give me the escat command please?
[05:26] <xchat81> Hi all
[05:26] <feihung> jrib I can write the blank file confused but can not paste file to it
[05:26] <Hattori> escat=exact ;}
[05:26] <cherubiel> Hattori: try to do a mount /dev/sda1 /somefolder
[05:26] <xchat81> Is there anyone with an HP laserjet 1020?
[05:26] <dudanogueira> how can i detect the wireless connections on my range?
[05:27] <ro1> i have a slightly deeper issue with my wireless
[05:27] <jrib> feihung: try 'cp ~/somefile /media/usbdisk', what does that say?
[05:27] <rednaxel> hi all
[05:27] <ro1> can someone help
[05:27] <scythe128> where are my .deb's downloaded to?
[05:27] <scythe128> using apt of course
[05:27] <dudanogueira>  i installed the network-manager-gnome, but cant see how to run it
[05:27] <graveson> i am starting xsane and it opens and just closes , how can i troubleshoot this
[05:27] <cherubiel> dudanogueira: install wifi-radar or kismet
[05:27] <jrib> scythe128: /var/cache/apt/archives/
[05:27] <dudanogueira> scythe128, /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:27] <XiXaQ> If I copy ~/.evolution, ~/.xchat and ,~/.gaim then I can get back all configurations, logs and other user data for those applications and just put them into a new edgy system?
[05:28] <scythe128> thanks
[05:28] <dudanogueira> XiXaQ, probably
[05:28] <dudanogueira> XiXaQ, you have to figure out for where the program send the files.. usually, it sends to .directory
[05:28] <IA-Outdoors> CarinArr: that was it
[05:28] <IA-Outdoors> recompiled ndis and I'm gold
[05:29] <Hattori> cherubiel: it says me i have to specify the kind of filesystem
[05:29] <cherubiel> Hattori: what device do yo have?
[05:29] <feihung> jrib: thanks yeah it's working from terminal , why I can not do it from nautilus
[05:29] <Hattori> usb storage key
[05:29] <Hattori> fat
[05:29] <cherubiel> Hattori: was it mac os(hpfs) formatted or vfat?
[05:29] <IA-Outdoors> so under ubuntu what's the trick to get ndis added on boot and have the windows drivers loaded automatically along wtih the write config settings?
[05:29] <rednaxel> last night I installed the latest NVIDIA driver, Version: 1.0-9629 - and managed to get Beryl working, all wonderful... today the X does not start anymore, complains about different versions of kernel modules
[05:29] <cherubiel> mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /somedir
[05:29] <xgm> Hello, how to share internet connection from eth0 to eth1 using iptables? Im doing this becouse my other pc(os: win xp) is conected by cable from eth1, so i want to make connection sharing, but i dont know how. can anyone help me ?
[05:30] <jrib> feihung: try closing nautilus and opening it again, maybe it needs to refresh what it thinks the properties are (maybe 'reload' works too)
[05:30] <xgm> I would be very thankfull
[05:30] <ailean> what happened to the menu editor that was in dapper?
[05:30] <ro1> hey i ran a lshw and found this  *-network:0 DISABLED
[05:30] <dooglus> what's the package name that will let firefox display chinese characters OK, rather than as 4 hex digits in a square?
[05:30] <ro1> how do i enable it
[05:30] <magical_trevsky> does anyone know if ubuntu has a similar program to chkconfig, and if so, what it's called?
[05:31] <boink> dooglus: look in view -> character encoding in your firefox
[05:31] <rednaxel> anyone here managed to get AIGLX/Beryl working with Edgy and NVIDIA 1.0-9629 ?!?
[05:31] <ro1> i tried modprobe nut i dont know what the name of the module is
[05:31] <guillem101> rednaxel, i do
[05:31] <guillem101> (64bit)
[05:31] <guillem101> but I do
[05:31] <cherubiel> magical_trevsky: that is supposed to check the status of daemons/services, right?
[05:31] <guillem101> no problems, and I've reboot some time ago
[05:31] <rednaxel> guillem101, did you compiled your kernel or something?
[05:32] <magical_trevsky> cherubiel, yeah
[05:32] <cherubiel> magical_trevsky: if yes, /etc/init.d/<sscript> status
[05:32] <Hattori> cherubiel: works.. how to copy an entire dir?
[05:32] <guillem101> rednaxel, I was using nvidia installer but I used the repositories later on
[05:32] <feihung> jrib: OK thanks :-)
[05:32] <xgm> I would be very thankfull
[05:32] <xgm> Hello, how to share internet connection from eth0 to eth1 using iptables? Im doing this becouse my other pc(os: win xp) is conected by cable from eth1, so i want to make connection sharing, but i dont know how. can anyone help me ?
[05:32] <guillem101> rednaxel, arre you using the installer??
[05:32] <magical_trevsky> cherubiel, I want to use it to add a new service though
[05:32] <rednaxel> guillem101, yes
[05:32] <jrib> feihung: np
[05:32] <rooks> hello all
[05:32] <magical_trevsky> cherubiel, where I would normally use 'chkconfig --add'
[05:32] <rednaxel> guillem101, is there a repo with version 1.0-9629 ?!?
[05:32] <guillem101> rednaxel, then the problem may be that you have upgraded your kernel
[05:33] <guillem101> rednaxel, yes, there are repos
[05:33] <boink> magical_trvsky: man update-rc.d
[05:33] <guillem101> let me check
[05:33] <rednaxel> guillem101, it's a fresh install of Edgy
[05:33] <timawa> i have issues on using dapper as router, caching dns server. Router can ping internet hosts but not from workstation. I can, however, use dig on internet hosts from the workstation.
[05:33] <boink> chkconfig doesn't exist in debian/ubuntu
[05:33] <magical_trevsky> boink, thanks
[05:33] <Walm> netpython: thought about mailman? (A)
[05:33] <Walm> !info mailman
[05:33] <cherubiel> Hattori: cp -r ?
[05:33] <ubotu> mailman: Powerful, web-based mailing list manager. In component main, is optional. Version 1:2.1.8-2ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 7824 kB, installed size 36552 kB
[05:33] <boink> mailman works quite well
[05:33] <boink> and it gives the users a nice webinterface
[05:34] <boink> but my favourite ML is ezmlm :)
[05:34] <guillem101> I cannot reach the mouse right now... rednaxel , check the beryl home page, at the wiki they have the repos for the drivers
[05:34] <PapaLion> how can I play a cue/bin without burning a cd?
[05:34] <boubar> have used mailman for a long while.  very stable, never had any issues with it
[05:34] <boink> it's good, yeah
[05:34] <Walm> boink or boubar do you know why i cant same changes from the webinterface
[05:34] <Walm> same=save
[05:34] <guillem101> rednaxel, alternatively you might run "nvidia-installer" and get gujded by the program. I guess it will compile the kernel module
[05:34] <graveson> i am starting xsane and it opens and just closes , how can i troubleshoot this
[05:35] <xgm> Hello, how to share internet connection from eth0 to eth1 using iptables? Im doing this becouse my other pc(os: win xp) is conected by cable from eth1, so i want to make connection sharing, but i dont know how. can anyone help me ?
[05:35] <boubar> Walm: What happens when you try to save changes?  error msg or any sort?
[05:35] <Walm> boubar: nothing at all , even not in /var/log/mailman/error
[05:35] <guillem101> xgm, firestarter does the trick for you
[05:35] <cherubiel> magical_trevsky: you should try /etc/rc.local, which is executed after every boot; not sure on other methods - sorry.
[05:35] <ro1> what is the standard module name for a wireless card ?
[05:36] <xgm> <guillem101> what repo should i add to install firestarter ?
[05:36] <cherubiel> !info firestarter
[05:36] <ubotu> firestarter: gtk program for managing and observing your firewall. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 383 kB, installed size 1884 kB
[05:36] <cherubiel> xgm: ^^
[05:36] <guillem101> xgm, I don't know if it is universe or multiverse
[05:36] <scythe128> anyone using guarddog?
[05:36] <guillem101> oh
[05:36] <boubar> Walm: Weird... see what your apache logs say
[05:36] <scythe128> or firestarter?
[05:36] <Walm> it looks to me it doesnt write to /var/lib/mailman/lists/sharpo/config.pck
[05:36] <ro1> i cannot do a modprobe without knowing, can someone please help
[05:36] <guillem101> cherubiel, you are my hero :-)
[05:36] <xgm> cherubiel: what ?
[05:36] <cherubiel> nah, i'm just a guardian angel ;)
[05:36] <LinAsH> ro1, there is not, it depends of your card
[05:37] <cherubiel> xgm: its universal
[05:37] <guillem101> xgm, universe
[05:37] <cherubiel> xgm: you can try !info <package>
[05:37] <Walm> [Thu Nov 09 10:15:57 2006]  [error]  [client 10.0.0.158]  script not found or unable to stat: /usr/lib/cgi-bin/mailman/icons, referer: https://walm.xs4all.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo

[05:37] <ubotu> firestarter: gtk program for managing and observing your firewall. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 383 kB, installed size 1884 kB
[05:37] <netpython> scythe128, shorewall
[05:37] <xgm> so i just need to write into terminal: sudo apt-get install firestarter ?
[05:37] <scythe128> !shorewall
[05:37] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[05:37] <netpython> scythe128, i can help you with the setup if you want
[05:37] <xgm> and afther that run it ?
[05:37] <guillem101> xgm, firestarter is a very simple gtk app that lets you do such simple configurations without hassle
[05:37] <Walm> boubar: or attempt to invoke directory as script: /usr/lib/cgi-bin/mailman/
[05:38] <ro1> LinAsH: ok, going to do a bit more research will be right back
[05:38] <cherubiel> xgm: apt-get update; after you add the repos to /etc/apt/sources.lst
[05:38] <cherubiel> xgm: then try apt-get install firestarter
[05:38] <guillem101> xgm, you run firestarter (with sudo) and the setup wizzard is self-explanatory
[05:38] <scythe128> Well, I am just toying with it right now and was wondering about peoples opinion
[05:38] <Walm> boubar: looks it is going to a wrong director
[05:38] <zoetrope666> hello all
[05:38] <scythe128> shorewall, is the the fork of ipcop/smoothwall?
[05:38] <jbroome> no
[05:38] <xgm> <cherubiel> how to know what repos should i add ?
[05:39] <netpython> scythe128, http://www.shorewall.net/
[05:39] <ro1> LinAsH: how do i find it out... the module name based on the name of my card
[05:39] <cherubiel> xgm: try !info <package>, it WILL show the repo
[05:39] <boubar> Walm: strange indeed. I do remember when I installed it, I had to do some manual items as well...
[05:39] <xgm> !info firestarter
[05:39] <scythe128> thanks for the link
[05:39] <ubotu> firestarter: gtk program for managing and observing your firewall. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 383 kB, installed size 1884 kB
[05:39] <cherubiel> ro1: start with lspci,
[05:39] <xgm> and ?
[05:39] <Hattori> i need linux-headers for my build. i don't have interent access on linux box, so i have to put on a usb storage key. where can i download linux-headers i need?
[05:39] <cherubiel> xgm: . In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 383 kB, installed size 1884 kB
[05:39] <Walm> boubar: probably used a guide / howto?
[05:40] <xgm> so i dont need to add any repos for firestarteR ?
[05:40] <guillem101> xgm, if you are not very strict, having universe and multiverse repos enabled is quite useful. You can enable them easily at synaptic
[05:40] <LinAsH> ro1, try this 'lspci |grep Network' or just lspci
[05:40] <xgm> kk
[05:40] <ro1> cherubiel: ok i located my wireless info
[05:40] <Hattori> i need linux-headers for my build. i don't have interent access on linux box, so i have to put on a usb storage key. where can i download linux-headers i need?
[05:40] <cherubiel> ro1: btw tat was beerware
[05:40] <ro1> LinAsH: ok will try
[05:40] <scythe128> I think Ill pass on shorewall for now
[05:41] <cherubiel> Hattori: check packages.ubuntu.com
[05:41] <netpython> scythe128, 1 min setup well depends on how fast you can type
[05:41] <scythe128> not on this laptop
[05:41] <scythe128> the r key is flakey
[05:41] <netpython> scythe128, :-)
[05:41] <ro1> LinAsH: found it, what do i do with info
[05:41] <genon> I have the very common problem with nvidia and it only displaying 800x600, edited the xorg.conf, and 1600x1200 is in the front, tried to reconfigure xorg.conf and it still doesn't work
[05:42] <LinAsH> ro1, so what is it ?
[05:42] <scythe128> I just wanted something to shutdown my ipchains a little
[05:42] <cherubiel> genon: do you have the drivesr installed properly?
[05:42] <ro1> LinAsH: 00:09.0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset (rev 01)
[05:42] <cherubiel> ro1: what *info* did you find? care to share?
[05:42] <netpython> scythe128, guarddog will do fine
[05:42] <scythe128> I normally am behind a spi firewall
[05:42] <genon> cherubiel: yeah, i have the nvidia setting in the system tool-bar
[05:42] <scythe128> or when Im at work Im behind all types of layerd security
[05:42] <hriostat> hello everybody.. someone could help me with a question?
[05:42] <scythe128> thanx
[05:43] <netpython> scythe128, welcome
[05:43] <ro1> cherubiel: saw it, i need to get it up and running

[05:43] <LinAsH> ro1, try modprobe prism54
[05:44] <LinAsH> ro1, or modprobe prism2_pci
[05:44] <ro1> LinAsH: ok, but why prism54 (learning purposes)
[05:44] <scythe128> 1600X1200? Id be glad to get 1280X768 (not in the 855 or 955 screen resolution tools)
[05:44] <ro1> LinAsH: ok

[05:50] <Adnarim> hi
[05:50] <smoenux> Hi all
[05:50] <Adnarim> I'm new to linux and I need to execute a file named: check.sh but how do I execute such files under linux?
[05:51] <LinAsH> ro1, run network-admin
[05:51] <genon> nobody who got any ideas?
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[05:51] <smoenux> can someone please help me with my Router and NAT setup in linux? just a link will do ^.^
[05:51] <tuna-fish> How do I find out what device (as in /dev/???) outputs my sound?
[05:52] <smoenux> !alsa | tuna-fish
[05:52] <ubotu> tuna-fish: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[05:52] <JosefK> genon: if it's not in your path (echo $PATH), you need to specify the path explicitly.  do this by cd'ing to the same path as the script, and typing './check.sh'
[05:52] <jbroome> smoenux: http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+firewall+iptables&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[05:52] <ro1> LinAsH: In that is a .ko file i used vi to open it and it's... I ran it already it as a matter a fact showed me wlan0 but it's configs say wired connections
[05:52] <smoenux> ty, jbroome
[05:52] <JosefK> genon: it's also worth checking the script has exec permissions with 'chmod 755 check.sh'
[05:52] <Adnarim> thx JosefK
[05:52] <genon> JosefK: uhm, check what script?
[05:53] <JosefK> sorry genon, attached the wrong name to the question, my bad
[05:53] <ro1> LinAsH: though it says wired i enabled it
[05:54] <genon> JosefK: oh, ok, I tought I hade missed something completely :P
[05:54] <ro1> LinAsH: but still no progress, im in that path you gave me but what do i do when i get there
[05:54] <LinAsH> does iwconfig list wlan0 ?
[05:54] <RazRew> jepp
[05:55] <ro1> LinAsH: yeah it does
[05:55] <Adnarim> JosefK I need to be admin as i think to execute this script but what is the su password on ubuntu? the one I took to login doesnt work for me?!?
[05:55] <Ayabara> noone? I use avidemux to join avi files, but I need an app to join mpeg files
[05:55] <JosefK> Adnarim: before you do that, I'd make damn sure you trust the source of the script
[05:55] <JosefK> Adnarim: after that, just prepend the command with 'sudo' and use your own password, ie. 'sudo ./check.sh'
[05:56] <LinAsH> ro1, what kind of network do you want to connect to ? wep protected ? wpa ?
[05:56] <Adnarim> yes it's from ati to check the version of my xfree86 because I need graphics driver installed
[05:56] <JosefK> Adnarim: then 'sudo ./check.sh'
[05:56] <JosefK> !sudo | Adnarim
[05:56] <ubotu> Adnarim: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:56] <LinAsH> ro1, and do you have a dhcp server ?
[05:57] <krabador> anybody from italy?
[05:57] <Adnarim> it doesnt work
[05:57] <scythe128> anyone know how to control speedstep in edgy?
[05:57] <Adnarim> goldstein@goldstein-laptop:~/Desktop$ !sudo ./check.sh

[05:57] <asdx> hi
[05:58] <ro1> LinAsH: how do i find that out, I am trying to connect to an unprotected network
[05:58] <asdx> how do i install beryl/nvidia 9626 in ubuntu
[05:58] <asdx> edgy
[05:58] <Adnarim> but the file check.sh is definitv on my desktop
[05:59] <genon> I have the very common problem with nvidia and it only displaying 800x600, edited the xorg.conf, and 1600x1200 is in the front, tried to reconfigure xorg.conf and it still doesn't work, and I have the proper drivers, and they are installed, as I have the nvidia-tool in the System Tool-bar
[05:59] <otacon22_> a easy/fast system to crypt files with a password by shell?
[05:59] <quiet> Adnarim, sh check.sh
[05:59] <quiet> or   sh ~/Desktop/check.sh
[05:59] <LinAsH> ro1, try 'sudo ifconfig wlan0 up && sudo dhclient wlan0' and see if you get an IP address
[05:59] <Adnarim> thx quiet this works
[06:00] <ro1> LinAsH: msg says, no such device
[06:00] <quiet> Adnarim, you didn't have check.sh set as executable.
[06:00] <quiet> chmod +xcheck.sh
[06:00] <quiet> er.
[06:00] <quiet> chmod +x check.sh
[06:00] <JosefK> genon: is it in front for the bit-depth you're using?
[06:00] <Adnarim> but he sais I have no console ownership ?
[06:01] <del4> how do i change my screensaver settings in ubuntu?
[06:01] <Adnarim> You are either not running this script from the console
[06:01] <Adnarim> or simply do not have console ownership.  Requirement failed.
[06:01] <Adnarim> Unable to determine XFree86 Version. Stopping now.
[06:01] <jwise> hello,my dears, I have some trouble with im-switch.
[06:01] <JosefK> sudo sh check.sh
[06:01] <LinAsH> ro1, what the name of the interface when you run iwconfig ?
[06:01] <IA-Outdoors> how do I configure ubuntu to apply my wireless settings on boot that I've been doing manually via iwconfig?
[06:01] <Adnarim> but I did it with sudo
[06:01] <quiet> do it without sudo.
[06:01] <JosefK> !network-manager-gnome | IA-Outdoors

[06:01] <jwise> I'm trying to install scim,and set it, using "im-switch -s scim-pinyin"
[06:01] <JosefK> IA-Outdoors: that works pretty nicely for me
[06:02] <IA-Outdoors> JosefK: any options under KDE?
[06:02] <jwise> and, I'm using root...
[06:02] <JosefK> !network-manager-kde
[06:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about network-manager-kde - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:02] <IA-Outdoors> lol
[06:02] <JosefK> err.. it's qt-network-manager or something, search the cache for network-manager and grep for kde/qt
[06:02] <jwise> Well, it tell me the error "No system wide default defined just for locale en_US "
[06:02] <JosefK> IA-Outdoors: it's definitely in there, takes most of the hassle out of using wireless and linux
[06:02] <Adnarim> I get the same error with sudo sh check.sh and sh check.sh
[06:02] <jwise> anyone help me?,thanks
[06:02] <IA-Outdoors> JosefK: thx
[06:02] <quiet> Adnarim, what isyour username?
[06:03] <Adnarim> goldstein
[06:03] <quiet> Adnarim, what does  ls -l check.sh  show?
[06:03] <IA-Outdoors> JosefK:  you mean knetworkmanager?
[06:03] <CarinArr> ia-outdoors, i still haven't managed to get mine to stick on boot;)
[06:03] <JosefK> IA-Outdoors: that'll be the one, thanks :) a while since I used kubuntu
[06:03] <smoenux> del4 ... try this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=198809&highlight=screensaver
[06:04] <Adnarim> quiet the output is: -rw-r--r-- 1 goldstein goldstein 11873 2006-11-09 17:45 check.sh
[06:04] <IA-Outdoors> CarinArr: if that doesn't work then I'll be scripting it in .bash_profile
[06:04] <CarinArr> ia-outdoors, no matter what i put in the network configurations, so i've just written a script file i run when i log in
[06:04] <CarinArr> which works fine
[06:04] <IA-Outdoors> right, same approach
[06:04] <genon> JosefK: yes it's in the front, and 1280x1024 behind, but he doesn't accept that one either
[06:04] <CarinArr> bit of a hack but i got sick and tired of fiddling
[06:04] <quiet> Adnarim, strange... do  chmod +x check.sh and then   sudo ./check.sh
[06:04] <Farm_Fresh> !automatrix
[06:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about automatrix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:04] <Gorxon> Hi, I have a little problem...trying the liveCD and my resolution wont go higher than x480. Thus I cant see the whole install dialog so I cant install Ubuntu...any suggestions?
[06:04] <Arepie> im using vmware-player, i use easyvmx, to create my .vmx file.. but, when i load the file.. and insert a bootable cd, it says i have nothing in my cdrom.. and im using sata hard disk.. is there any any effect?
[06:05] <Farm_Fresh> !automatix
[06:05] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[06:05] <quiet> Gorxon, open aterminal and see what   xrandr -s 800x600  gives you?
[06:05] <wastrel> quiet, Adnarim could be a bash/dash thing ?
[06:05] <quiet> dash?
[06:05] <Hese_> #ubuntu
[06:05] <del4> smeonux thanks. :)
[06:05] <Hese_> FTW
[06:06] <wastrel> Adnarim:  are you on dapper or edgy?
[06:06] <wastrel> !dash
[06:06] <Gorxon> Size 800x600 not found in available modes
[06:06] <ubotu> /bin/sh links to the DASH shell in Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). Since DASH is not 100% compatible with the BASH shell, some scripts might break. You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to "#!/bin/bash"
[06:06] <Adnarim> edgy
[06:06] <Farm_Fresh> Ok, so whats the deal with automatix?  No good?
[06:06] <quiet> oh ew..
[06:06] <quiet> Farm_Fresh, no, no good.
[06:06] <Adnarim> but the same error again quiet
[06:06] <Farm_Fresh> quiet: Why?
[06:07] <davi1> problem (sry for my bad english, but at the german support chan theres nobody who can help me...): since ive updated my ubuntu to edgy, my (pci) wlancard is detected as an ETHERNET card... can sb help me fixing that? i work now on an older kernel which is working perfectly...
[06:07] <ro1> LinAsH: nothing comes up on iwconfig, but going to Network admin it says wlan0
[06:07] <ricflazz> why does ubuntu not have rubygems in the repository?
[06:07] <Qwell[] > So, after upgrading from Dapper to Edgy, my gnome is acting a bit...funky.  I can't run certain applications (gnome-terminal), and I somehow completely lost the ability to alt-tab...
[06:07] <quiet> Farm_Fresh, use it and find out.
[06:07] <Adnarim> what is the right console? bash dash ?
[06:07] <quiet> Adnarim, try bash check.sh
[06:07] <Gorxon> kinda stupid to design an install program that requires over 640x480 res tho...
[06:07] <M0E^lnx> does anyone know where I can get this key ? http://media.blutkind.org/xgl/quinn.key.asc
[06:07] <Adnarim> k
[06:07] <Qwell[] > oh, and in order to bring a window to the front, I have to click the title bar now..  that's new
[06:07] <M0E^lnx> that site is down... I think it got hacked
[06:07] <feydin> hey there  can anyone recommend me a good tool to add audio to an existing video? (mp3)
[06:07] <Adnarim> also the same error
[06:07] <Gorxon> but if my res would go higher I wouldnt complain
[06:08] <Farm_Fresh> quiet:  The only reason I ask is because the reviews off its web page seem good.
[06:08] <thaytan> anyone know why my LD_LIBRARY_PATH (set in ~/.profile) is being reset on login these days?
[06:08] <Gorxon> and cant resize the dialog
[06:08] <Gorxon> to less than 640
[06:08] <M0E^lnx> anyone know any good repositories for XGL/Compiz?
[06:10] <davi1> problem (sry for my bad english, but at the german support chan theres nobody who can help me...): since ive updated my ubuntu to edgy, my (pci) wlancard is detected as an ETHERNET card... can sb help me fixing that? i work now on an older kernel which is working perfectly...
[06:10] <davi1> maybe the hardware detection works wrong... or a driver is not loaded... or... xD
[06:11] <LinAsH> ro1, you said that iwconfig list wlan0, check if the module is loaded : lsmod | grep prism
[06:11] <ro1> ok
[06:11] <optimusprime> is there a way to make a bootable Win XP CD through Ubuntu?
[06:11] <M0E^lnx> anyone here running compiz?
[06:12] <ro1> LinAsH: prism2_pci
[06:12] <dreamer> hmm, something strange: when I finish downloading stuff ubuntu (X) gets slooooowww
[06:12] <scythe128> can you insmod the driver module and assign the card that driver (more technical than I can help with though)
[06:12] <quiet> if you already have one, optimusprime
[06:12] <Gorxon> so no one can help me?
[06:12] <scythe128> dreamer, you on a laptop?
[06:12] <Gorxon> get higher res on live cd
[06:12] <dreamer> nop
[06:13] <dreamer> it's really the mouse though
[06:13] <scythe128> oh, well there goes my speedstep guess :)
[06:13] <dreamer> typing and switching between workspaces seems to go fine ..
[06:13] <dreamer> speedstep ?
[06:13] <dreamer> it really happens when I literally _finish_ a download
[06:14] <dreamer> I have it in valknut and bittorrent now
[06:14] <scythe128> powersaving built into intel and amd processors to make them run slower and save battery on mobile chips
[06:14] <optimusprime> if I already have what?....the Win XP bootable CD?
[06:14] <dreamer> ok
[06:15] <ro1> LinAsH: prism2_pci             74752  0 to be specific
[06:15] <user-land> in cfdisk, how can i specify ext3 ?
[06:15] <shriphani> guys how to play microshit's wmv3 files ?
[06:15] <GaiaX11> How do I automatically mount cdrom's? /etc/fstab - auto/noauto ?
[06:15] <Fallen_Angel> Excuse me can some one help me with a problem with my UBUNTU ?? Apache 2 + Php 5 poblem with russian and latvian language charsets
[06:16] <ro1> when im doing modprobe <module> will it be modprobe <prism2_pci > ?
[06:16] <Acrune> hey, I need to write a program in C that displays information about a process, such as process credentials, process address space, process states, things like that
[06:16] <LinAsH> ro1, when you do modprobe prism2_pci yes
[06:16] <Acrune> any ideas how to go about that?
[06:16] <ro1> ok just did it
[06:16] <ro1> LinAsH: cool
[06:17] <ro1> just did it
[06:17] <GaiaX11> Someone could help me? How do I automatically mount cdrom's? /etc/fstab - auto/noauto ?
[06:17] <ro1> LinAsH: i guess that means there was success cuz there was no error
[06:17] <Fallen_Angel> Excuse me can some one help me with a problem with my UBUNTU ?? Apache 2 + Php 5 poblem with russian and latvian language charsets
[06:17] <ro1> LinAsH: but what do i do from here
[06:18] <LinAsH> ro1, if iwconfig doesn't list your card I don't really know :(
[06:18] <OMF> newbie q:) hey i'm having some trouble installing an app... when i try to install it, i get an error message that the command make is not found...
[06:18] <[DOW] Shaddar> is the dhcp-server automatically installed and configured after installing ubuntu or have i to configure it manually ?
[06:18] <OMF> do i have to modify the script, or can i resolve this another way

[06:19] <joeyk_> why is rdesktop and tsclient both smearing my text...
[06:19] <joeyk_> http://jo3net.com/images/ugh.jpg
[06:19] <ro1> LinAsH: ok i will keep trying
[06:19] <joeyk_> just started after an update to 6.10
[06:20] <ro1> LinAsH: thanks for the help
[06:20] <SanityInAnarchy> my apt-get and/or aptitude is crashing. Seems to happen after I install a package, but before the next reboot. Crashes cold, will not release the lock, system won't reboot -- sync hangs
[06:20] <LinAsH> ro1, good luck
[06:20] <shriphani> wont edgy be shipped ?
[06:20] <SanityInAnarchy> this is after the Edgy upgrade, I'm guessing the new kernel
[06:20] <quiet> shriphani, no.
[06:20] <quiet> shriphani, they will continue to ship dapper.
[06:21] <shriphani> quiet, when will "they" ship edgy ?
[06:21] <quiet> shriphani, if you're talking about shipit....  they won't.
[06:21] <shriphani> uh oh
[06:21] <kodat> anyone know how to edit hyperlinks in GAIM away messages..cuz i used html but i dont think it worked
[06:21] <SanityInAnarchy> anyone else seeing the same thing? Anything stupid I haven't thought of? It's NOT GOOD that I have to pull the plug (literally) on a server to get my apt back!
[06:21] <shriphani> quiet, why so ?
[06:22] <quiet> dapper is LTS
[06:22] <Konnektion> i think gaim (or trillian) one of the two uses a plugin to support HTML in profiles/away messages
[06:22] <Konnektion> might wanna look on their site
[06:22] <shriphani> and edgy is not ?
[06:22] <quiet> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue14#head-1e3555bea7bd06018bbadcf89ed23281e09d78f1
[06:22] <quiet> shriphani, no.
[06:22] <joeyk_> whats another rdp client besides rdesktop and tsclient?
[06:22] <shriphani> well i didnt see an LTS on breezy either
[06:22] <Konnektion> joeyk_ define rdp
[06:22] <joeyk_> remote desktop protocol
[06:23] <Konnektion> vnc?
[06:23] <quiet> shriphani, there's not... dapper was the first lts.
[06:23] <joeyk_> nah
[06:23] <shriphani> so only LTS will be shipped henceforth ?
[06:23] <Konnektion> windows to linux?
[06:23] <joeyk_> linux to windows
[06:23] <quiet> don't know, shriphani.
[06:23] <sgorilla71> vnc is the most cross-platform
[06:23] <sgorilla71> vncviewer
[06:23] <OMF> thanks sanity in anachy: are there any more useful packages i should install?
[06:24] <Konnektion> joeyk_ can i ask why VNC isnt a option?
[06:24] <SanityInAnarchy> OMF:  other than build-essential? I don't know, check what it's asking for
[06:24] <Fallen_Angel> Excuse me can some one help me with a problem with my UBUNTU ?? Apache 2 + Php 5 poblem with russian and latvian language charsets
[06:24] <SanityInAnarchy> OMF:  I assume you're trying to compile something from scratch, you'll probably have to install libxxx-dev if it says it can't find xxx
[06:24] <Konnektion> joeyk_: i think theres something called Vino for gnome
[06:25] <shriphani> quiet, have you any idea about playing wmv3 files in linux ?
[06:25] <Fallen_Angel> Excuse me can some one help me with a problem with my UBUNTU ?? Apache 2 + Php 5 poblem with russian and latvian language charsets
[06:25] <OMF> one more q, what is the default directory for the kernel files in ubuntu 6.06?
[06:25] <joeyk_> i'll check it out
[06:25] <Konnektion> Fallen_Angel: do you have them installed system wide?
[06:26] <Konnektion> is the problem only in apache or will the whole system not display those charecters
[06:26] <Konnektion> joeyk_: also look into FreeNX
[06:26] <Fallen_Angel> Konnektion
[06:27] <quiet> shriphani, wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats   get the stuff you need installed and you should be able to view them with mplayer.

[06:27] <SanityInAnarchy> quiet:  isn't wmv3 supported? I thought it was wmv9 that needs the win32 codecs?
[06:28] <quiet> no clue.
[06:28] <quiet> i assume the gstreamer plugins can add that capability.
[06:28] <Farm_Fresh> quiet:  well I've installed automatix.. we'll see what happens.
[06:28] <quiet> Farm_Fresh, you will get no support here if something breaks.
[06:29] <Farm_Fresh> quiet:  I figured that.. But this box is nothing more than a toy.. and a clean install only take a few minutes.

[06:44] <wanted1> Konnektion: I tried both. The system doesn't boot when the disk is inserted  when i turn on the system. When I wait after boot, the system hangs as soon as I insert the flashdisk.

[06:46] <roler> ifireball, ; yes
[06:46] <wanted1> Konnektion: i used 5.10 before and got no problems with it. should i use 6.10 instead?
[06:46] <sundari> ifireball, i tired... but no luck with firefox
[06:46] <ifireball> roler: depends on the language, and desktop env you're using
[06:46] <Konnektion> wanted1: only think i can think of is maybe try to update to edgy.. maybe its a driver issue and now its fixed.. i know alot of my hardware had problems with 6.06.. and work in 6.10

[06:47] <xst> Can anyone explain this: For a mount point I have specified "noauto" as mount option in /etc/fstab. But still it is mounted automatically upon boot. This behavior came with edgy. Why is it beeing auto-mounted?
[06:47] <jbroome> OMF: have you downloaded the src?

[06:49] <Wanderer> Anyone have a HOWTO on making a simple deb package from a tgz?
[06:49] <roler> I also have a problem in Edgy where I can't do a traceroute. First of all I have no traceroute command, it's traceroute6... When I run it on any host or IP, it says "Unknown host xxxxxxxxxx" no matter what I type
[06:49] <quiet> Wanderer, alien might be able to do it?
[06:49] <Wanderer> quiet: I'll look
[06:50] <sundari> ohh... never mind... i got it
[06:50] <sundari> thanksd
[06:50] <scout> why is it to freakin hard to get a ftp server up and running ?
[06:50] <Wanderer> roler: looks like your dns is horked and you need to install the "traceroute" package
[06:50] <quiet> scout, it's not.
[06:50] <quiet> aptitude install proftpd
[06:51] <OMF> jbroome: nope... where do i do that?
[06:51] <ifireball> roler: seems traceroute isn't installed on edgy by default, traceroute6 is for ipv6
[06:51] <roler> arrgh
[06:51] <Skorgu|Work> Anyone have L2tp/IPSec working under ubuntu?
[06:51] <scout> quiet, well yes it is.... i've been trying to get this freaking proftpd to work for so long!
[06:51] <quiet> man proftpd?
[06:51] <roler> i swear i typed apt-get install traceroute the other day and it wasn't avail, now it is. thanks :)
[06:51] <strabes> st_
[06:51] <strabes> oops
[06:51] <[DOW] Shaddar> are there any networking-windows in ubuntu to see the reachable wireless-lan-networks ?
[06:51] <foomanchew> anyone using Rhythmbox with DAAP ?
[06:52] <quiet> [DOW] Shaddar, if you use networkmanager...  otherwise... just open a terminal and   iwlist wlan0 scan
[06:52] <phenex> umm guys, it's really urgent... what could cause sound on ubuntu to disappear like this after upgrade?
[06:52] <tisse> isnt make menuconfig supposed to work in /usr/src/linux-generic something ? can i just download the regular kernel and install?
[06:52] <scout> quiet, i just get frustrated that it has to be so hard... why can't i just define a list of users using a gui or something
[06:52] <scout> ?
[06:52] <quiet> lol
[06:52] <quiet> sounds like you miss windows?
[06:53] <jbroome> !tell OMF about kernel source
[06:53] <tisse> !tell tisse about kernel source
[06:53] <scout> quiet, no not at all,,, i've been using linux for about five years now...
[06:53] <quiet> scout, did you ever think to do something like.... idunno....  google for "proftpd setup" or something similar?
[06:53] <ifireball> scout: because proftpd is ment for HUGE servers, its probably way more complicated then what you need
[06:53] <[DOW] Shaddar> quiet, where can i find the networkmanager ? i can only find "networking" and "network tools" in amdinistration
[06:53] <bcnl> strange, should this iptables command not work?
[06:53] <bcnl> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 -d 208.68.18.68 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination  10.169.1.3:80
[06:53] <quiet> [DOW] Shaddar, you'd have to install it.
[06:53] <jbroome> and you'll probably want build-essential while you're at it
[06:53] <quiet> time for lunch.
[06:53] <scout> ifireball, yes exactly :) i just can't find anything more suitable ...
[06:54] <tisse> i installed kernel sources but make menuconfig keeps failing
[06:54] <ifireball> scout: vsftpd?
[06:54] <scout> ifireball, i'll check it out.... thnx
[06:54] <ifireball> scout: just search for "ftp" on synaptic, plenty of servers there
[06:55] <scout> ifireball, yeah i know... everyone just keeps on saying proftpd
[06:55] <scout> now i'm gonna try vsftpd
[06:55] <[DOW] Shaddar> hm ^^ i've installed ubuntu 6.10 from live-cd (dont' know if it's installed automatically) ... can i add programms/packages from live-cd which where not installed automatically ?
[06:56] <ifireball> scout: anycase, ftp is a bad choice for many things, probably the single most unsecure file tansfer protocol there is
[06:56] <xst> What is the status of bug #58721? It has been marked with high importance but there doesn't seem to be any progress. In the meanwhile, all Matrox users are left extremely with bad gfx performance. :-(

[06:56] <haffe> [DOW] Shaddar, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
[06:56] <haffe> [DOW] Shaddar,  You installed from the Live-CD, now you rebooted without the CD, and now you want to install additional programs?
[06:56] <[DOW] Shaddar> i'm searching the networkmanager quiet meantioned
[06:56] <Ayabara> anyone using mplayer? in edgy my movies seem to wide no matter what aspect ratio I choose.
[06:56] <zspada15> haffe: use synaptic
[06:57] <zspada15> or better add/remove
[06:57] <Ecnassianer> I'm still running Dapper and I've been hearing about a lot of issues upgrading to Edgy, should I hold out until the dust settles or should I just push through before too many updates get stacked on top of the release version?
[06:57] <zspada15> eerr [DOW] Shaddar
[06:57] <[DOW] Shaddar> cause i can't find anything to connect to my wlan-network here at home
[06:57] <scout> ifireball, one of my friends is going to FXP something to me
[06:57] <[DOW] Shaddar> or to search reachable wlan-networks
[06:57] <zspada15> [DOW] Shaddar: are you familiar with command line?
[06:57] <tisse> why wont make menuconfig work in the kernel source!?!?
[06:57] <[DOW] Shaddar> not really ^^
[06:57] <ifireball> scout: I see.
[06:58] <zspada15> [DOW] Shaddar: i assume you are in gnome, run applications-acessories-terminal

[06:59] <[DOW] Shaddar> ahm ... i guess it's pci (onboard at my laptop)

If I 'sudo reboot' from a console then I get the graphical kubuntu logo+progress bar for shutdown/startup and all is well.  Help?
[07:00] <ifireball> GaiaX11: becasue the gnome volume manager doesn't use fstab

[07:08] <zspada15> [DOW] Shaddar: make a password
[07:09] <cherubiel> crashzor: ifireball is right, only give the client that is connecting to the remote machine.
[07:09] <ro1> cherubiel: how do i enable a hardware device that has been disabled ?
[07:09] <[DOW] Shaddar> i typed "/msg nickserv register <my-pw> <my-email>" and then this error-msg came

[07:09] <[DOW] Shaddar> @ zspada15
[07:09] <zspada15> just do /msg nickserv register <password> no quotes

[07:09] <ifireball> IA-Outdoors: I suppose you can make favorits out of them

[07:11] <[DOW] Shaddar> zspada15: yes, and worked (i guess ^^)
[07:11] <soppman> green_earz: i have hdparm but then what?:) hdparm -d wont tell since ubuntu thinks my sata disk is a scsi disk thanks to a stupid raid controll
[07:11] <marltu> how to get C header files that matches my kernel?
[07:11] <infernaljesus> how do I connect to a WPA-TKIP wireless network?
[07:11] <WikinG> kitche: how to enable compositie in xorg.conf ???
[07:12] <infernaljesus> I have installed gnome- network manager and wpa supplicant
[07:12] <infernaljesus> but I still don't see an option for WPA
[07:12] <dnite> I'm wondering.. how do I add something to fstab?? I tried to add my usb drive to fstab, but when i reboot, i get an fsck error and it drops to a maintanance shell ... is there a different place for this in ubuntu? so i can get my usb disks to mount where I want them instead of where gnome/ubuntu feels like they should mount to?
[07:12] <osfameron> infernaljesus: gnome-network-manager didn't do anything useful for me until I rebooted and unplugged from the wired lan connection
[07:12] <zspada15> dnite: type sudo mount into the terminal
[07:13] <CarinArr> right.. stupid question, but does anyone know how you change version of ubuntu you're using on the ubuntu forums?
[07:13] <infernaljesus> osfameron, so I reboot and unplug myself and it will work?
[07:13] <dnite> zspada15, ok?
[07:13] <green_earz> soppman: http://linuxgazette.net/issue79/punk.html http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2000/06/29/hdparm.htmlhttp://www.gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Use_hdparm_to_improve_IDE_device_performance#Getting_information_about_your_different_drives
[07:13] <infernaljesus> osmaferon, well... it's worth a shot...
[07:13] <Konnektion> CarinArr: prolly in my control panel or something of the like
[07:13] <ifireball> dnite: I suppose a better idea would be to hack the config file to the gnome volume manager, pluggeble stuff like useb drives don't belong in the fstab
[07:13] <soppman> pwd
[07:14] <CarinArr> ignore me i found it
[07:14] <kitche> WikinG: ther is couple of ways to do it think dpkg-reconfigure will ask you a question about it
[07:14] <CarinArr> after going over it like three times
[07:14] <CarinArr> <- blind
[07:14] <cherubiel> ro1: is your PnP OS option disabled in the BIOS?
[07:15] <ro1> cherubiel: would i check that by cardctl ident ? If not how
[07:16] <green_earz> soppman: hdparm only reads ide devices not sata devices
[07:16] <dnite> ifireball, that's strange.. why is that? i put it in there as noauto and i really just want to be able to control where it gets mounted w/o having to explicitly call the whole mount statement.. i've never had that problem in any other distro...
[07:18] <IA-Outdoors> ok, what's the quick fix to the, IMHO, messed up default behavior of VIM?
[07:18] <cappicrd> fun
[07:18] <dnite> IA-Outdoors, what's the messed up default behavior of vim?
[07:18] <IA-Outdoors> I guess I could just copy a vimrc from anotehr box
[07:18] <cherubiel> ro1: not sure, you might want to restart your networking.. ifdown and ifup
[07:18] <ifireball> dnite: I think the errors you're seeing might have to do with the new init system, in anycase changin the fstab will probably not effect where gnome mounts it
[07:18] <any> Hi
[07:18] <kitche> dnite: well you should just be able to do mount /dev/<device> <mount> but usb stuff in ubuntu gets added to /media automatically
[07:19] <Qixx> hi; i got a really weird problem which is getting increasingly irritating
[07:19] <Qixx> been trying to solve it for months; eventually gave up - till i got it working; then broke it again
[07:19] <dnite> ifireball, ok.. thanks..
[07:19] <Qixx> basically; i got a 17" laptop; which runs at a widescreen resolution
[07:19] <Qixx> and an external 17" screen (not widescreen)
[07:19] <Qixx> i want to run the external screen *only* at 1280x1024 + OpenGL, but yeah --- it refuses :(
[07:19] <Qixx> it wants the 1280x800 resolution that the laptop runs at; or 1024x768
[07:19] <Qixx> i got it to run at 1280x1024 with a *very* nasty xorg.conf (uses xinerama) -- but then no opengl
[07:19] <Qixx> [oh yeah; and HP NX7400 / Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
[07:19] <IA-Outdoors> dnite: appending doesn't allow me to backspace paste the spot I hit append...arrow-down sometimes adds a line with "D" on it
[07:19] <IA-Outdoors> etc
[07:19] <IA-Outdoors> it's almost like it's straigh vi instead of vim
[07:19] <Qixx> [and i got it working by using fedora; their display tool fixed it -- but i couldnt get it to work a second time :(
[07:19] <osfameron> infernaljesus: any joy?

[07:20] <osfameron> infernaljesus: there should be a little icon in the taskbar which has a "just do what I mean" action on clicking on it
[07:20] <scythe128> hey all you happy people
[07:20] <any> How can I get the list of the names of the faces for xterm (fixed is the only one recognized) ?
[07:20] <osfameron> infernaljesus: I got quite bad tempered about it while I still had a wired connection.  The moment I removed that, it decided to actually do something useful.
[07:20] <angel_of_shadow> c'est moche xchat simple :x
[07:20] <dnite> IA-Outdoors, ah.. i'm not sure.. i only use vim for ruby on rails coding.. and the ruby vim package and rails.vim plugin seems to clear up any of the 'issues' with vim's default actions..
[07:20] <IA-Outdoors> in fact that is it
[07:21] <IA-Outdoors> dnite: vi is not a symlink to vim like in other distros
[07:21] <infernaljesus> osfameron, I see the conenction icon (if that's what you're talking about) and I click it and I can choose wired or wireless. But when I choose wireless I can only type WEP keys, not WPA
[07:21] <infernaljesus> *connection
[07:21] <osfameron> infernaljesus: I'm getting the impression that ubuntu laptop networking might be working (as in, as well as XP if not Mac) by Feisty or whatever the next version is called...
[07:21] <ifireball> rebelfallen: it can be done but I don't think it'll be very easy
[07:21] <osfameron> infernaljesus: for me it correctly identified that my dad's connection was protected by WPA and Did The Right Thing
[07:21] <rebelfallen> ifireball: I don't doubt it would be a pain in the arse but I think it can be done
[07:22] <soppman> how do i install a .deb file i have downloaded?
=== BenC_ is now known as BenC
[07:22] <osfameron> infernaljesus: whereas at home it just got me onto my (unprotected, yeah yeah, I suck) network without asking me any questions
[07:22] <cherubiel> soppman: dpkg -i <filename>.deb
[07:22] <rebelfallen> I know bios doesn't let you boot from USB so I am unsure where to start there is prob #1
[07:22] <socomm> soppman: dpkg -i debfile.deb
[07:22] <infernaljesus> osfameron, I installed wpa_supplicant, but all it has in the /etc/wpa_supplicant/ is ifupdown.sh
[07:22] <infernaljesus> osfameron, shouldn't there be a .conf?
[07:22] <osfameron> infernaljesus: yeah, me too.  I couldn't make head nor tail of it
[07:22] <ifireball> rebelfallen: there is probably some king of a linux boot loader for usb like syslinux for CDs and grub for HDs you need to learn about that first
[07:23] <osfameron> infernaljesus: are you on Edgy?  I think wpa_supplicant was preinstalled, so perhaps you're not
[07:23] <j0nas`> anybody got the ipw3945 working?
[07:23] <j0nas`> i desperately need help making it work
[07:23] <infernaljesus> osfameron, yes, UI'm on edgy
[07:23] <scythe128> woohoo 49 minutes of batter, 37 minutes left of work :)
[07:23] <lupine_85> j0nas`: in edgy?
[07:23] <j0nas`> yes
[07:23] <osfameron> infernaljesus: oh well.  Like I said... maybe it'll be functional in Feisty... *maybe*
[07:23] <lupine_85> should be supported out of the box. if you run 'iwconfig', do you see a wireless interface?
[07:23] <j0nas`> i just installed edgy... wireless does not work
[07:23] <digilux> .
[07:23] <lupine_85> !doesntwork
[07:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about doesntwork - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:23] <j0nas`> i can see my network with iwlist scanning
[07:24] <ifireball> rebelfallen: you'll probably also need to compile your own kernel to enable it to mount root fs from usb
[07:24] <j0nas`> but i cant get a dhcp reply
[07:24] <lupine_85> ah, so it /does/ work, you just can't get connected
[07:24] <rebelfallen> yeah I figured , I found a boot loader needs me to compile my kernel
[07:24] <j0nas`> scanning works
[07:24] <j0nas`> thats it
[07:24] <lupine_85> most common cause of a lack of dhcp reply is that you're not associated to the AP
[07:24] <e319> is the ubuntu cd a live cd or just install cd?
[07:24] <j0nas`> AP?
[07:24] <lupine_85> run iwconfig again and see if the AP (access point's) MAC address shows up
[07:24] <scythe128> e319 both
[07:25] <j0nas`> sec
[07:25] <ifireball> rebelfallen: you're pretty much porting ubuntu to USB.. publish your work when you're done... :P
[07:25] <Walm> boink?
[07:25] <j0nas`> lupine_85: yes i see the mac
[07:25] <lupine_85> j0nas: if it doesn't (e.g. it says 'Access-point: <N/a|invalid|not-associated> then run sudo iwconfig <interface name> ap <AP's mac address>
[07:25] <lupine_85> ah, ok
[07:26] <e319> scythe128: so if i boot up, then i will boot right into the live cd, with the option to install from the main screen?
[07:26] <lupine_85> can you assign a static IP?
[07:26] <rebelfallen> ifireball: I'll keep a journal and post it somewhere when I am done. I don't think this has been written about if not even done before
[07:26] <scythe128> who whould want an abuse button in their irc program?? wth?? kick, ban, op, notice, dcc, I can use those, but abuse?
[07:26] <e319> also, does ubuntu give you the ability to reburn a livecd with the changes you have made to your install?
[07:26] <scythe128> sorry, had to rant
[07:26] <j0nas`> no :(
[07:26] <crochat> Petite question sans aucun rapport avec Ubuntu
[07:26] <j0nas`> networking worked fine out of the box with breezy
[07:27] <j0nas`> also with edgy beta
[07:27] <lupine_85> yes... wonder what's gone wrong
[07:27] <lupine_85> is ipw3945d running ?
[07:27] <ifireball> rebelfallen: the guys that made damn small linux might have a guide up somewhere
[07:27] <j0nas`> i had an older kernel... 2.6 .... 15?
[07:27] <infernaljesus> osfameron, do you know of any other wifi managers?
[07:27] <e319> so does anyone know if i can save changes to my ubntu install and then burn a new cd?
[07:27] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: wifi-radar
[07:27] <j0nas`> i couldnt make ipw3945 driver when i tried to build from source
[07:27] <lupine_85> e319: tar up /etc and /home and there's your settings - mostly
[07:27] <Wei_Li> hi, the cd i burnt for installing ubuntu on my computer keeps having problems so I'd like to know if you can just install ubuntu using the internet the source instead
[07:27] <j0nas`> im running livecd now...
[07:27] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: for the purists, iwlist/iwconfig
[07:27] <lupine_85> j0nas`: you shouldn't need to build it from source
[07:28] <j0nas`> brb im going to boot from hd
[07:28] <cherubiel> j0nas`: that driver works out of the box,
[07:28] <lupine_85> but I /know/ it works from the hd
[07:28] <cherubiel> j0nas`: its included with ubunut
[07:28] <shingalated> Can anyone tell me how to manually add the repository keys (the Release.gpg key files)  I am unable to download the keys the normal way, because port 8080 is being used by the router
[07:28] <j0nas`> is it in restricted modules?
[07:28] <lupine_85> cherubiel: it's 'working', but not receiving/sending network traffic
[07:28] <marltu> how to get C header files that matches my kernel?
[07:28] <infernaljesus> cherubiel, how would I use iwlist ?
[07:28] <lupine_85> you might need linux-restricted-modules installing, yes
[07:28] <TuOki^> Hello i have problem with tomcat5, when i start it, it shutdown itself right away
[07:28] <j0nas`> k brb
[07:29] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: on a term, iwlist <interface> scan
[07:29] <e319> so ubuntu boots right into the live cd? it wont overwrite anything unless i ask it to correct?
[07:29] <infernaljesus> cherubiel, yes, I have scanned it. But can I connect over it? :p
[07:29] <Wei_Li> yeah
[07:29] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: iwconfig does the dirty job, iwlist lists details
[07:29] <Wei_Li> hi, the cd i burnt for installing ubuntu on my computer keeps having problems so I'd like to know if you can just install ubuntu using the internet the source instead </repeat>
[07:29] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: man iwconfig
[07:29] <scythe128> e319 correct
[07:29] <pip> sry i closed down my window so i didnt see if anyone posted a sources.list to me :)

[07:35] <shingalated> I'm trying to setup a server for my teacher, but I can't get the repository keys because port 8080 is blocked by the router
[07:35] <j0nas`> k i am running... ipw3945 is loaded, ipw3945d running
[07:35] <scythe128> then your gonna need to use a dif port or create a routing rule
[07:35] <j0nas`> still cannot get a dhcp reply from my router
[07:35] <shingalated> can i somehow add the release.gpg files so apt will see them?
[07:35] <cherubiel> darn, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=244624, anyone worked on this one?

[07:37] <infernaljesus> cherubiel, I installedw wifi-radar, but when I click on my network and then want to edit it it isn't doing anything :/
[07:37] <scythe128> i dont know if you can change the port of apt-get, but you can create a routing table or rule on the router/firewall to allow port 8080
[07:37] <iter> shingalated: apt-key add <file>
[07:37] <j0nas`> i cant get a dhcp reply from my router for some reason
[07:37] <chuckyp> j0nas`, are you sure the router is set up for dhcp?
[07:38] <infernaljesus> cherubiel, I installed wifi-radar, but when I click on my network and then want to edit it it isn't doing anything :/
[07:38] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: it would show some info on the bottom of the wifi-radar window, what does it sat?
[07:38] <scythe128> you can manually enter that info j0nas

[07:38] <infernaljesus> connected to None ip(192.168.100.14) but that's because I'm over my wired connection
[07:38] <cherubiel> shingalated: maybe your proxy variable is set? unset http_proxy

[07:39] <cherubiel> unset HTTP_PROXY
[07:39] <roryy> which gcc version is used for kernel compiles in ubuntu 6.06 and ubuntu 6.10? is there an easy way to find out?
[07:39] <infernaljesus> it just told me none ip (127.0.0.1) so I wasn't connected anywhere

[07:39] <j0nas`> can you think of why it might not work?

[07:40] <cherubiel> infernaljesus: you should have the same ssid set in the network manager
[07:40] <scythe128> shin, there a proxy on your network?

[07:42] <threete> my ubuntu 6.10 freezes at the first slider screen on my desktop pc. anybody got any pointers on what I could do? Cd checksum is ok.
[07:42] <scythe128> you can set synaptic up to use the proxy.  The proxy should have port forwarding enabled

[07:44] <infernaljesus> cherubiel, ?
[07:44] <scythe128> is there a way to specify which port to sue with apt from cli?
[07:44] <shingalated> scythe, my teacher said that i am not behind the proxy, the only reason I can not use port 8080 is that it is being used by the router for remote management.
[07:44] <scythe128> nolimit, what do you mean by base system, with or without x

[07:45] <threete> Ubuntu 6.10 install freezes at the first progress bar on my desktop pc. Anybody got any pointers on what I could do? Cd checksum is ok.
[07:45] <nolimitsoya> scythe128, doesnt matter, though its no problem if its without. just aslong as its small, and doesnt take a lot of work to strip down to choose a custom wm
[07:45] <slinky_> What application do you folks use to play music?
[07:46] <psusi> xmms
[07:46] <scythe128> uhhh.... ubuntu, knoppix, damn small linux, puppy linux, there are a ton out there
[07:46] <scythe128> I believe ubuntu actually has a program to let you roll your own live cd
[07:46] <scythe128> pupply linux is less than 40 meg
[07:47] <slinky_> psusi: do i need to remove the gstrreamer0.10 plugins before i install xmms?
[07:47] <nolimitsoya> scythe128, the ubuntu disc is tons of work to strip (been there, done that) dsl lacks apt (or did last time i tried) and puppy lacks packages

[07:48] <JosefK> rather, and replacy the http://proxy/ part with the qualified address to your proxy
[07:48] <frozenflame> i installed the server version of ubuntu and I want o be able to manage display mamanager
[07:48] <psusi> boot from the livecd, format the disk, mount it, debootstrap it, and install only the packages you want
[07:49] <JosefK> psusi: that's a bit of work?  you can install a command line system from the alternate CD, then add packages after
[07:49] <nolimitsoya> psusi, that done, though i cant find a good way of turning it into a workng live system

[07:51] <rc-1> how do i solve it?
[07:51] <b0ss_> could anyone help me out
[07:51] <nolimitsoya> scythe128, debian or other apt system is preferred.
[07:51] <shingalated> scyth, is there a way to change the port being used by apt?
[07:51] <JosefK> rc-1: first try a friendly kill, 'sudo kill 29952'
[07:51] <JosefK> rc-1: then wait a second, and see if it's still there using that 'ps -ef | grep dpkg' again
[07:51] <scythe128> shin, nothing about it in the man page
[07:51] <b0ss_> HI, i need help  on how to get wine is there a sudo apt command for wine?
[07:51] <slinky_> psusi: thank you, I'lll give it a try
[07:51] <JosefK> rc-1: if it doesn't die, it's probably hung, so do 'sudo kill -9 29952'
[07:52] <nolimitsoya> if anyone knows how to turn an installed ubuntu system into a bootable live cd that would be equally helpfull :) my attempts have all turned out pearshaped

[07:53] <nolimitsoya> psusi, im sorry, but i dont see how that is going to help me... say i mount, extract and chroot the live cd image, how is installing ubuntu-minimal going to give me a smaller system?
[07:53] <JosefK> no scythe128
[07:53] <mnepton> scythe128: no, it's AMD64
[07:53] <JosefK> EM64T/AMD64
[07:53] <kitche> scythe128: depends some of them are EM64T compatiable
[07:53] <scythe128> doh, im getting behind on my chips
[07:53] <psusi> nolimitsoya: wait, are you trying to make a livecd or are you trying to get a very small installation base on the hard disk?
[07:54] <kitche> just like some of the pentium 4 are EM64T
[07:54] <scythe128> really??  when did the p4 go 64?
[07:54] <Thunderpants> mnepton, will the generic kernel utilise both processor cores?
[07:55] <nolimitsoya> scythe128, the idea was to make a live system thats <256mb, with good hwdetection and openoffice :) ive done it on a hdd with ubuntu, but no luck with getting the damn thing live :)

[07:56] <kitche> b0ss_: but there is winehq official repos as well

[07:56] <b0ss_> o
[07:56] <b0ss_> ok ill refer to it thanks
[07:57] <nolimitsoya> scythe128, dsl wont do openoffice and xfce, and since itll have to be <256mb i wont be albe to have every program on disc. if i can span to a usb drive and apt the packages i need from the repos, that fix it
[07:57] <nolimitsoya> casper helps me do that with great eaze, why ubuntu/debian is just great :)

[07:59] <L1> How to mount floppy disk?   # mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy -t vfat      returns   "device not found"
[07:59] <nolimitsoya> psusi, stripping down the obvious packages from the live cd still turns out to be to big, and hunting and findigt all the thousands of tiny packages that make up all that extra weight is several days of work. changing the system in the squashfs file to the one ive got working on a virtual hdd fails to boot :)
[07:59] <rebelfallen> damn, was hoping for something free
[07:59] <b0ss_> the only reason i have linux is because i wanted tot ry it out and  it screwed up windows
[07:59] <psusi> rebelfallen: if you install ubuntu, it will automatically ( with your permission ) shrink the windows partition to make room for itself

[08:00] <psusi> nolimitsoya: ahhhhh you really want to pare down the livecd?  I see
[08:00] <Adnarim> noone an idea how to install module-assistant?
[08:01] <psusi> nolimitsoya: then it sounds like you need to build your own livecd from scratch, rather than modify the existing one

[08:48] <jackrazz> infernalfesus, check out automatix...I think it does wma
[08:49] <h1st0> Weed_Man, you are correct I do not.  Most likely that is the case.
[08:49] <h1st0> jackrazz, please dont' recomend automatix

[08:49] <jackrazz> ok h1st, why??
[08:49] <infernaljesus> h1st0, automatix?
[08:50] <brandini> oh hell
[08:50] <Enoxs> I think the problem with the new laptops AMD64  based is the PCI-e bus. Maybe kernel 2.6.19 will bring a solution
[08:50] <jackrazz> h1st0, how about easyubuntu...is that recommended for wma?
[08:50] <brandini> where is a list of all the packages for ubuntu 6.10?
[08:50] <h1st0> infernaljesus, its a hacked up program to install stuff in ubuntu and it does it in a vary bad way.
[08:50] <h1st0> jackrazz, neither is recomended usually in here due to the breakage that will insue.
[08:50] <jackrazz> h1st0, is that still true?
[08:50] <h1st0> brandini, packages.ubuntu.com
[08:50] <infernaljesus> h1st0, I never used automatix...
[08:50] <jackrazz> ok, fair enough..I thought those problems were solved with automatix2
[08:51] <h1st0> jackrazz, it will always be true as long as they are installing from source the wrong way and using unsupported stuff.
[08:51] <h1st0> jackrazz, I dunno I just know no one will support it in here.
[08:51] <h1st0> !automatix | jackrazz
[08:51] <ubotu> jackrazz: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[08:51] <jackrazz> ok, I guess it depends on whats installed as a lot is installed via debian
[08:51] <jackrazz> more specifically aptitude
[08:52] <h1st0> jackrazz, its just a crappy way of doing stuff that is already easy.

[08:54] <jackrazz> alltray does it...I'm looking for choices
[08:54] <h1st0> jackrazz, well you can right click and add dthe notification area most apps go up there.  hrm..  or you could modify the window list applet.
[08:54] <jackrazz> m'kay, get out of the gnome environment, then apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
[08:55] <jackrazz> h1st, I don't see that for thunderbird
[08:55] <jackrazz> right click minimized icon at the bottom?
[08:56] <jackrazz> hum, modify the window list applet
[08:56] <jackrazz> thats a tray app right?
[08:57] <m`kay> jackrazz: this delete just the metapackage
[08:57] <jackrazz> h1st, can I control what's put in the window list ?

[08:59] <omar_> I was going to upgrade to edgy from 6.06

[08:59] <omar_> I preffered to stay

[09:08] <somervil> no, I wanted to get it via apt

[09:13] <youser> things that i normally sig on to or load webpages take forever instead of seconds
[09:13] <MarcN> FlyingSquirrel32: your code? you may want to start it like this:     (nohup syslog2mysql &)      perhaps redirecting stdio, stderr

[09:52] <pcgigabyte> So any other suggestions adm
[09:52] <jake_> ofer0: what should happen? I got a response like:  10 Nov 04:22:45 ntpdate[5564] : the NTP socket is in use, exiting
[09:53] <youser> i cannot connect to the internet after hooking up my router, but the router does work after ive connected to the internet first
[09:53] <adm> pcgigabyte, not at the moment, sorry
[09:53] <jake_> but time is still wrong
[09:53] <h1st0> youser, what type of router?
[09:53] <youser> dlink
[09:53] <h1st0> youser, did you configure the router?
[09:53] <youser> i dont have the model name or number
[09:53] <jake_> is should be +2GTM (Finland time)
[09:53] <youser> no
[09:53] <youser> i dont know how
[09:53] <ofer0> jake_, it means something isn't working correctly. you better investigate. netstat -antp
[09:53] <h1st0> youser, is it a broadband router?
[09:53] <youser> ive tried running pppoeconf with router hooked up and it cant find my network interface
[09:53] <ofer0> jake_, use sudo tzconfig
[09:54] <h1st0> youser, i.e. does it have a wan port?
[09:54] <youser> its a cable internet router
[09:54] <lozzy> ofer0: That is very helpful, thank you. However, when I use alsamixer, it uses my stupid onboard sound by default. How can I make sure it uses my Audigy?
[09:54] <h1st0> youser, does it have a wan port?
[09:54] <youser> whats a wan port?
[09:54] <ofer0> lozzy, you can configure the default sound device using the gnome volume controller
[09:54] <h1st0> youser, like cable modem > router > pc  is what you are trying to achieve?
[09:55] <ofer0> youser, wireless port
[09:55] <h1st0> ofer0, no
[09:55] <youser> hlst yes
[09:55] <youser> and its not wireless
[09:55] <h1st0> youser, is there a rj45 jack on the back that says WAN  or internet by it?
[09:55] <ofer0> oops
[09:55] <ofer0> wide area network
[09:55] <youser> no
[09:55] <youser> just slots 1-5
[09:55] <h1st0> youser, ahh okay.
[09:55] <youser> im running on the router right now
[09:56] <h1st0> youser, what model router do you have?
[09:56] <youser> cuz i was paying xbox  live last  night
[09:56] <youser> im nto sure all i know is its a dlink i havent been able to find anything on it
[09:56] <jordo2323> ofer: whats the unrar standard command to unrar a file that was made into successive rar files for size?
=== ubuntu is now known as santeria
[09:56] <lozzy> ofer0: I'm afraid it still uses my realtek chip when I type 'alsamixer', I've changed the device in volume control.
[09:56] <santeria> ok im getting mad
[09:56] <h1st0> youser, okay well to do cable > router > pc  you would need a broadband router in your situation.  Or a cable modem that controls its own connection.
[09:56] <youser> right now i am connected through the router
[09:57] <lozzy> I've had this problem before, and I could set it in my /etc/modprobe.conf, but Ubuntu doesn't have this file?
[09:57] <aboredman> looking for some help related to wireless drivers. how do i find which driver version my wlan is using?
[09:57] <h1st0> youser, right now your setup requires that the computer logins in to get a connection from the isp I assume.
[09:57] <youser> but  if i restart with it hooked up it wont detect my network card
[09:57] <ofer0> lozzy, don't know about that.. sorry mate
[09:57] <dean__> Does only the alternate install CD have the option to re-install the bootloader?
[09:57] <h1st0> youser, ?
[09:57] <lozzy> ofer0: no problem mate.
[09:57] <santeria> im on my brothers computer which also has an nvidia card and im talking to you from kubuntu while mine doesnt work for ubuntu or any version(edgy,kubuntu,dapper) it just shows colored lines
[09:57] <jake_> ofer0: it seems that NTP server isn't workin' at all
=== Agrajag_ is now known as Agrajag
[09:57] <youser> i am hooked up through the router right now
[09:57] <h1st0> youser, do you have dsl or cable modem?  Because you mentioned pppoe?
[09:58] <youser> but if ir estart it doesnt work
[09:58] <ofer0> jake_, that would be impossible, I just updated my time using it.
[09:58] <youser> cble modem
[09:58] <jake_> I'm not sure, but when I use command netstat -antp there is not shown anything like ntp
[09:58] <ofer0> jake_, but you can try "ntpdate 1.pool.ntp.org
[09:58] <h1st0> youser, but you use pppoe to conect to your isp?
[09:58] <t3chn0b0y> has there been a fix for the bttv audio issue... ?? its the only thing stopping me from removing windows from my system.. i have to have television...
[09:58] <youser> but it only works if i hook up the roter after ive connected directly with modem
[09:58] <santeria>  I WANT UBUNTU :(
[09:58] <youser> yes
[09:58] <jake_> ofer0: just something about gaim and this IRC Client
[09:58] <mnepton> santeria: so download it
[09:58] <santeria> it doesnt work
[09:58] <h1st0> youser, thats wierd.
[09:58] <ofer0> jake_, is it related to the NTP issue ?
[09:58] <youser> well its a cable modem but i use pon dsl-provider
[09:59] <santeria> dapper, edgy, and kubuntu all dont work
[09:59] <h1st0> youser, did you just buy the router?
[09:59] <youser> nope
[09:59] <jenda> how can I transfer a file via SSH into the PC I'm sitting at (ass opposed to scp, going from the one I'm sitting at)
[09:59] <adm> santeria, why don't they work?
[09:59] <santeria> whenever it starts to load it just shows colored lines
[09:59] <youser> got it from my isp years ago
[09:59] <adm> oh
[09:59] <santeria> and on my bro and dads computers they work fine
[09:59] <jake_> ofer0: I'm not sure - I'm still a newbie in Linux, even I have 2 years experience
[09:59] <h1st0> youser, your best bet would be to get a broadband router to share the connection.
[09:59] <mnepton> santeria: what video card? how is that card configured in the BIOS?
[09:59] <mc44> santeria: is this the live CD?
[09:59] <youser> but i dont get hwo it works
[09:59] <h1st0> youser, or config your cable modem to see if you can set it up to login with out the need of the computer doing the pppoe connection.
[10:00] <youser> like i can stay here and goplay xbox live right now
[10:00] <jake_> ofer0: anyway - Linux is my last OS - I will not return to Windows; if I don't have to :)
[10:00] <youser> i need to make it connect through the router right?
[10:00] <jonas123> ubuntu wont detect the external monitor i am using on my notebook correctly. could somebody help me with that?
[10:00] <santeria> my brother has an agp nvidia 5950 ultra and i have a nvidia 6800gs
[10:00] <youser> for some reason i try to connect after the router is hooked up it wont find my n etwork card
[10:00] <santeria> which is pcie
[10:00] <ofer0> jake_, great :)
[10:00] <jake_> ofer0: and I'm wondering... why I didn't start from ubuntu in first place; this distro seems be much better than FC
[10:01] <h1st0> youser, right now your cable modem is just a box that changes the data from the line to a usuable signal.  However its kind of a dumb box it still requires your computer to initiate the pppoe connection.  Without the computer doing that  you aren't connected to the net.
[10:01] <h1st0> youser, right?
[10:01] <youser> why cant my computer do that through the router?
[10:01] <mc44> santeria: is it an amd64?
[10:01] <aboredman> how do i find the driver version my wireless card is using?
[10:01] <h1st0> youser, because the router is probable asigning ips to the devices.
[10:01] <santeria> his is a amd 2200+ i think, mine is an amd64 3500+.
[10:01] <youser> ahh
[10:01] <t3chn0b0y> just a few things to work out and windows cd will be a toaster... :D
[10:02] <jake_> ofer0: I'm now studying wine, but still something problems raises up
[10:02] <youser> so theres no way i can make my comp connect to the internet with  my router hooked up?
[10:02] <santeria> would the 64 bit version of ubuntu work better?
[10:02] <h1st0> youser, your cable modem is looking for your computer at lets say 192.168.1.0 and th router is telling yoru computer its at 192.168.1.100 or something you will have issues.
[10:02] <youser> i have to always connectu sing modem then hook the modem through the router?
[10:02] <Hattori> just upgraded to edgy. serverX doesn't start. fixed internet connection. any suggestion? nvidia drivers were installed and working before the dist-upgrade.
[10:02] <h1st0> youser, you kind of need a hub in your situation not a router.  But thats another story.
[10:03] <h1st0> youser, does the router have an ip address?
[10:03] <youser> thats a pain in the ass but at least i can still share my connection for now
[10:03] <santeria> and dapper, edgy and kubuntu all dont work on mine but work on my brother/dads
[10:03] <santeria> live cd
[10:03] <youser> how would i check since its hooked up right now
[10:03] <jonas123> ubuntu wont detect the external monitor i am using on my notebook correctly. could somebody help me with that?
[10:03] <h1st0> youser, ifconfig on yoru computer to get your current ip?
[10:03] <youser> ifconfig?
[10:03] <youser> ok
[10:03] <youser> yeah
[10:03] <h1st0> youser, open a terminal and type in ifconfig
[10:03] <h1st0> whats your ip showing up?
[10:04] <h1st0> inet addr
[10:04] <youser> i have eth0, lo and ppp0
[10:04] <h1st0> youser, inet addr on eth0
[10:04] <youser>  inet6 addr: fe80::240:f4ff:fe66:65f5/64
[10:04] <youser> thats for eth0
[10:04] <h1st0> youser, not inet6 inet just above that
[10:05] <youser> eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:40:F4:66:65:F5
[10:05] <youser>           inet6 addr: fe80::240:f4ff:fe66:65f5/64 Scope:Link
[10:05] <youser>           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
[10:05] <youser>           RX packets:83210 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
[10:05] <youser> it only shows inet6 for eth0
[10:05] <youser> sorryif flooding
[10:05] <h1st0> youser, okay what about ppp0  does that have a inet addr
[10:05] <santeria> so anyone got any ideas to help my problem?
[10:05] <youser> yep
[10:05] <h1st0> What is it?
[10:05] <aboredman> youser: you have a ppp0 connection which is usually used for dsl rather than cable tho
[10:05] <youser>  inet addr:206.191.91.86
[10:05] <youser> maybe i have dsl
[10:05] <h1st0> hrm....
[10:05] <youser> i dunno the diff between dsl and cable
[10:06] <aboredman> dsl = high speed thru phone, cable = cable
[10:06] <jordo2323> How do I extract a successive rar file in file roller?
[10:06] <youser> i use a splitter between my tv and modem
[10:06] <youser> so it is cabl
[10:06] <h1st0> youser, dsl is throught he phone line cable modem is throught he cable like for your tv
[10:06] <pi1l> can anybody tell me, how can i get and install linux kernel headers and source code for the Running kernel in ubuntu?
[10:06] <h1st0> youser, what kind of jacked cable uses pppoe
[10:06] <youser> should i not use pon dsl-provider to connect then?
[10:07] <youser> i dunno
[10:07] <h1st0> youser, who's your cable company?
[10:07] <youser> the only way icould find to set up my conection was pppoeconf
[10:07] <youser> small canadian isp
[10:07] <youser> amtelecom
=== G-net|Gilnim is now known as gilnim
[10:07] <h1st0> youser, i've never heard of a cable modem using pppoe
[10:07] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what's up with getting the hda modules into ubuntu? or will that have to be in fiesty?
[10:07] <youser> shouldi use something other than pppoeconf to set u p my connection?
[10:08] <santeria> ok ill explain this all again. on my computer(amd64 3500+,6800gs pci-e 2gb ram) ubuntu and kubuntu dont work. but on my dads computer(intel celeron , integrated, 256 mb ram) and my brothers computer(amd 2200+,768 mb ram, nvidia fx5950 ultra agp) it works fine
[10:08] <aboredman> cable using pppoe is possible but dumb cause you would lose bandwith for basicly the same resut
[10:08] <jordo2323> I am trying to extract a large rar file in file roller.....the kind that is .r00, .r01, .r02 etc......how is this done?
[10:08] <h1st0> youser, plug the cable modem directly in to your pc.  see if it gives you an ip address on eth0
[10:08] <tremaine> hello all
[10:08] <whadar> how can i sum the install size of (many) multiple packages?
[10:08] <youser> ok one second ill unhook my router
[10:09] <santeria> what the problem is on mine, is that when it starts to load, it shows a bunch of horizontal/ sometimes vertical colored lines and doesnt do anything after that.
[10:09] <h1st0> youser, something is wrong with your setup there.
[10:09] <adm> santeria, try 64bit ubuntu
=== babwe2 is now known as babwe
[10:09] <youser> ok
[10:09] <youser> lol thatwas easy
[10:09] <santeria> you think that owuld work?
[10:09] <mc44> santeria: you could try the alternate CD installer which is a text based installer
[10:09] <h1st0> youser, okay now try sudo ifdown eth0
[10:09] <santeria> cause jordan_u said that prbobably idnt have anything to do with it last night
[10:09] <h1st0> youser, then sudo ifup eth0
[10:09] <youser> whats that do
[10:10] <h1st0> youser, brings the network card down then back on.
[10:10] <santeria> so download edgy 64 bit?
[10:10] <adm> santeria, it might make some progress trying it, better than trying nothing
[10:10] <h1st0> youser, then ifconfig and see if you have an inet addr for eth0
[10:10] <santeria> or dapper 64 bit?
[10:10] <santeria> true, and i have a lot of dvd-rs :)
[10:10] <caolan_> Hey, just a quick q, how do I start up dual screen on my laptop? I have a monitor plugged in but no image is appearing yet...
[10:11] <adm> personally i'd go for edgy, but.. it's up to you
[10:11] <santeria> i'll go with edgy
[10:11] <h1st0> caolan_, depends on the laptop if its possible or not.
[10:11] <tremaine> is anyone here running and irc server under Ubuntu?
[10:11] <h1st0> !ircd > tremaine
[10:11] <jake_> jordo2323: I'm a newbie, but I'd done that successfully in Fedora Core - do you've any rar compatible extract software installed?
[10:11] <Candamir> how can i resize the partitions on my hard disk? is this only possible during the install process?
[10:11] <santeria> im loving ubuntu on my dads slow ass computer tho he has like a 1200 mhz celeron, 256 mb ram and it runs alot faster than windows :D
[10:11] <h1st0> Candamir, gparted
[10:12] <jordo2323> jake_  I just installed Ubuntu....I have file roller....
[10:12] <aboredman> candamir : qparted
[10:12] <h1st0> Candamir, the default install I believe resizes the windows disk and ubuntu takes 50% of the drive.
[10:12] <whadar> how can i sum the install size of all available packages?
[10:12] <caolan_> h1st0, I have done it under WinXP... but I know how troublesome laptops can be in linux. Anywhere I might be able to find out if it is possible?
[10:12] <jake_> jordo2323: have you ever before use Linux ?
[10:12] <Candamir> gparted is for gnome?
[10:12] <mc44> santeria: does it get to the boot menu?
[10:12] <jordo2323> jake_: Yeah....
[10:12] <h1st0> caolan_, what type of video chip does the laptop have?
[10:12] <jordo2323> jake_: brb
[10:13] <jake_> jordo2323: so you aren't so newbie :)
[10:13] <cntb> have extremely high resolution want to lower resolution on  KDE windows manager . HOW?
[10:13] <Enselic> Is there a good symbolic calculator for Linux?
[10:13] <aboredman> question: how do i find which version is my wireless card (centrino ipw2100) driver is using?
[10:14] <jake_> gpaterd or wais it qparted is for GNOME or something like that.. I'd use it in Fedora Core and it really does know what it is doing
[10:14] <caolan_> h1st0, I'm guessing a bit here, but I think its some SiS model
[10:14] <jake_> wais == was
[10:14] <ranger> question: how can i start the wpa_supplicant at boot?
[10:14] <SeAofSaRo> how do I make drives not write protected on my system?
[10:14] <caolan_> h1st0, its a Dell Inspiron 1000
[10:14] <h1st0> caolan_, hrm...  possibly search for your model of laptop on the forums but you will most likely hav eto edit your xorg.conf to get it going.
[10:14] <Candamir> when running the program from alt+F2, neither gparted nor qparted works
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> i think im gonna go back to mandriva
[10:15] <h1st0> !mount > SeAofSaRo
[10:15] <gnomefreak> Candamir: did you install it?
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> ubuntu sucks @ NVidia drivers
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> its saddening too
[10:15] <mikeconcepts> if anybody is having the problem where sessions/startup programs doesn't save settings do this sudo chmod a+w /home/[USERNAME] /.config/autostart/  the problem is in Edgy the file is owned by root rather than the user, so settings don't get saved, this will change the owner to you
[10:15] <gnomefreak> Alakazamz0r: mine work fine
[10:15] <bradley> does beryl cause many problems --in general or in setup?
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> gnomefreak, with extreme hacking?
[10:15] <h1st0> Alakazamz0r, really nvidia-glx too difficult for you?
[10:15] <CarinArr> alakazamz0r, er.. are you being funny?
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> h1st0, no...
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> CarinArr, no
[10:15] <gnomefreak> bradley: not really but please see #ubuntu-xgl
[10:15] <CarinArr> having said that i install my nvidia drivers using the nvidia installer
[10:15] <youser_> im back
[10:15] <bradley> gnomefreak, thanks.
[10:15] <h1st0> Alakazamz0r, then how do they suck?
[10:15] <gnomefreak> Alakazamz0r: that is a personal problem not nvidia problem
[10:15] <caolan_> h1st0, thanks for the tip, I'll see if I can find some Xorg.conf editing article
[10:15] <youser_> i was  getting horrible 30 sec lags
[10:15] <CarinArr> work perfectly though
[10:15] <Alakazamz0r> they install great h1st0 but... all i get is 640x480@50hz
[10:16] <ranger> question: how can i start the wpa_supplicant at boot? what need i to modify?
[10:16] <sheriff_> To install any of those desktop docks do i also have to install xgl?
[10:16] <Alakazamz0r> and i dont feel like hacking my freakin xserver just to get it to give me a decient resolution.
[10:16] <SeAofSaRo> h1st0: it says !mount event not found
[10:16] <h1st0> Alakazamz0r, oh so your monitor is set up wrong or they aren't installed properly
[10:16] <jake_> its a gparted
[10:16] <youser_> is there some special ways i should set my cable connection thats not pppoeconf?
[10:16] <h1st0> Alakazamz0r, you don't have to hack xserver.
[10:16] <Alakazamz0r> h1st0, it has to do with the 440mx nvidia car4d.
[10:16] <gnomefreak> Alakazamz0r: change your refresh rates or add the res. to your xorg
[10:16] <Alakazamz0r> its my work computer, i really dont need DRI... but it'd be nice for the fast switch beryl manager
[10:16] <Alakazamz0r> gnomefreak, i already have.
[10:16] <h1st0> Alakazamz0r, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   will bring up a little screen in terminal where you can select the resolutions you want availbile.
[10:16] <Alakazamz0r> done that too
[10:17] <CarinArr> alakazamz0r, g4 440mx?
[10:17] <Alakazamz0r> yes CarinArr
[10:17] <gnomefreak> Alakazamz0r: did you make your refresh rates. more of a span?
[10:17] <CarinArr> alakazamz0r, my laptop has that exact card and has always worked flawlessly with ubuntu
[10:17] <aboredman> youser: system>administration>networking . Make sure your wired connection is set to DHCP (not static ip)
[10:17] <Alakazamz0r> gnomefreak, they're that that the Trinitron monitor states
[10:17] <ranger> plz. help me
[10:17] <SeAofSaRo> Alakazamzor: is it possible to run beryl with older ubuntu releases?
[10:17] <cntb> !resolution
[10:17] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[10:17] <youser_> with direct cable modem is till nly have an inet6 address for eth0
[10:17] <ranger> question: how can i start the wpa_supplicant at boot? what need i to modify? i use debian edgy
[10:17] <CarinArr> including 1400x1050 res
[10:17] <Candamir> oops, thanks, installed it and i'm running it now
[10:17] <Candamir> thanks
[10:17] <gnomefreak> SeAofSaRo: on dapper thats about as far back as you can
[10:18] <lol> how fix this bug in ubuntu 6.06 ? http://www.speedtouch.co.uk/330highspeed.asp
[10:18] <Alakazamz0r> CarinArr, then why dont you screen me in and fix me up
[10:18] <Alakazamz0r> :)
[10:18] <sheriff_> question : To install any of those desktop docks do i also have to install xgl?
[10:18] <adm> try.. nvidia-settings
[10:18] <Alakazamz0r> im gonna get a geforce 4 7000 series...
[10:18] <SeAofSaRo> gnomefreak: so it won't work in ubuntu 6.06?
[10:18] <Alakazamz0r> for my home desktop
[10:18] <SeAofSaRo> only edgy?
[10:18] <Alakazamz0r> hopefully it'll work a little better than this 440 card.
[10:18] <CarinArr> alakazamz0r, i'm not sure where you could go wrong to be honest
[10:18] <youser_> looking in ubuntuforums.org it seems people are saying pppoeconf is used for cable modems

[10:20] <h1st0> youser, linksys makes some really nice ones.  the router will intiate the pppoe connection so even if your pc is off your xbox will still be able to get online.

[10:29] <Milk_> plesnivec, use Samba, you need samba-common and samba-client (maybe smb instead of samba).  Then you need to created user/pass in samba that matches both the linux and windows users

[10:31] <Staz> zspada15 : So how can I make deletion possible?
[10:31] <zspada15> Staz: in order to be able to write to NTFS, you have to build it in your kernel
[10:31] <Milk_> plesnivec, right click on them in nautilus and share them
[10:31] <Faint> Ok
[10:31] <JosefK> Faint: or you may have an option for a one-time-boot menu by pressing F12 (if it's a dell, and possibly others)

[10:37] <yanis> when  I try to apt-get mplayer-686 I get the following : Package mplayer-686 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[10:37] <fm> hi!
[10:37] <salim> my ntfs partition seems to be defect, what can I do?
[10:37] <santeria[FL] > the first one?
[10:37] <mc44> santeria[FL] : it should not be too complicated to install
[10:37] <santeria[FL] > or second one
[10:37] <gnomefreak> yanis: enable multiverse repos
[10:37] <zspada15> salim: cry
[10:37] <gyaresu> Wulfie, Effectively running an emulated i386 environment
[10:37] <santeria[FL] > or is it a mirror?
[10:37] <fm> Where do I select the general spellcheck language in edgy please?
[10:37] <salim> :-(
[10:37] <gyaresu> salim, Define defect please.
[10:38] <adm> the first link is for amd64, second appears to be for x86
[10:38] <zspada15> what do you mean defect
[10:38] <salim> can I try to repair it with windows cd but without defecting it?
[10:38] <santeria[FL] > HEY IM LIKIN THIS FIRST LINK 888 KB/S :D
[10:38] <yanis> gnomefreak: I have. : Package mplayer-686 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[10:38] <zspada15> salim: have another hd that will fit its data on it?
[10:38] <yanis> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[10:38] <gnomefreak> santeria[FL] : please dont use caps
[10:38] <mc44> ranger: sorry cant help you with that
[10:38] <yanis> is only available from another source
[10:38] <yanis> gnomefreak: deb http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy-backports main restricted universe multiverse
[10:38] <gnomefreak> yanis: you havent. more than likely you enable the backports
[10:38] <ranger> mc44: thanks
[10:38] <santeria[FL] > ok....
[10:38] <gnomefreak> yanis: my point :)
[10:38] <salim> it says something about error in cluster allocating, wrong bitmap size or so
[10:38] <ranger> question: hello how can i optain a ip address automatic ?
[10:38] <zspada15> salim: ugg.....
[10:39] <gnomefreak> yanis: on the lines that end in universe you add a space and type multiverse
[10:39] <zspada15> !google | salim
[10:39] <ubotu> salim: Google is a very popular search engine: http://www.google.com  -  Google also has a Linux-specific search engine: http://google.com/linux
[10:39] <psusi> salim: are you messing around with captive-ntfs or ntfs-3g?
[10:39] <gnomefreak> yanis: backports are not the multiverse repos they are an extention of them
[10:39] <gyaresu> ranger, more specifics please?
[10:39] <yanis> gnomefreak: like that: deb http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe multiverse
[10:39] <salim> when I want to mount, it says bad option bad superblock, missing codepage or other error
[10:39] <gnomefreak> yanis: yes
[10:40] <ranger> gyaresu: wpa_supplicant starts at boot.
[10:40] <salim> I tried to resize it with partition magic, but it didnt go well...
[10:40] <zspada15> salim: your screwed
[10:40] <gyaresu> ranger, so iwconfig gives you a working connection?
[10:40] <zspada15> salim: partition magic DOES NOT AND WILL NOT work, don't use it
[10:40] <psusi> salim: boot into windows and run a chkdsk
[10:40] <salim> and somehow I cant even boot my ubuntu, that's what makes me really cry
[10:40] <salim> somehow it stops during boot
[10:40] <ranger> gyaresu: but i get no ip addres. sry after a dhclient ath0 i get a ip address
[10:40] <psusi> ahhh, there's your problem
[10:40] <zspada15> salim: it wipes everything from the disk
[10:41] <psusi> partition magic eats disks for lunch
[10:41] <zspada15> never use it again if you can help it
[10:41] <rambo3> !paste
[10:41] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:41] <salim> ok I'll never use it again, but what can I do now?
[10:41] <psusi> format and reinstall
[10:41] <zspada15> its even better to use the fdisk from slackware than that
[10:41] <ranger> gyaresu: the wpa_supplicant starts at boot, after a dhclient ath0 in the bash i get a ip address.
[10:41] <gyaresu> ranger, Have you tried setting a static IP? (you may not want to)
[10:41] <mc44> ranger: does your /etc/networking/interfaces file have a "
[10:41] <mc44> auto lo ath0
[10:41] <mc44> iface ath0 inet dhcp" line?
[10:41] <psusi> zspada15: fdisk does not do what partition magic does... you are comparing apples to oranges
[10:42] <zspada15> well, if you can try booting into a live cd and running a fsck on /dev/hd
[10:42] <Alakazamz0r> bleh
[10:42] <Alakazamz0r> it didnt work
[10:42] <Alakazamz0r> and it isnt worth my time.
[10:43] <salim> but I can mount my ubuntu partitions, but why can't I boot into it?
[10:43] <ranger> gyaresu: yes i ve this line
[10:43] <salim> it just stops showing the ubuntu splash with a few lines in the status bar
[10:43] <ranger> auto ath0
[10:43] <psusi> zspada15: not on an NTFS filesystem you can't
[10:43] <ranger> iface ath0 inet dhcp
[10:43] <salim> i am in ubuntu live cd right now
[10:43] <zspada15> hmmm....
[10:43] <zspada15> ur screwed
[10:43] <zspada15> but
[10:44] <zspada15> if u have another hd to store stuff on, boot into recovery mode on the m$ cd, and copy files onto that disk
=== mheath[laptop] _ is now known as mheath[laptop] 
[10:45] <salim> if I just boot with windows cd, will it destroy my linux partitions?
[10:45] <zspada15> salim: not if u dont install
[10:45] <ranger> gyaresu: can you help me how i a optain a ip address
[10:45] <aktiwers> if you install it will overwrite DRM
[10:45] <salim> and if I repair?
[10:45] <h1st0> !limewire > allen2003
[10:45] <psusi> the windows repair feature usually makes things worse
[10:46] <pianoboy3333> !limewire > me
[10:46] <hfhf> what's allen2003?
[10:46] <aktiwers> Yes repair will overwrite DRM as well
[10:46] <gyaresu> ranger, yes. just reading 'up' rules (man interfaces). You need post-up type rule...

[10:47] <pi1l> can anybody please tell me what is the safiest way of enabling network on vmware- virtual machine?
[10:47] <Przemcio78> to install ubuntu or mandriva? this is the question?
[10:47] <hfhf> ubuntu
[10:47] <pianoboy3333> hfhf: same as: !tell _username_ about _topic_
[10:47] <gyaresu> ranger, try adding 'post-up dhclient ath0' to the end of the ath0 section.
[10:47] <hfhf> mandriva seems like it's dead
[10:48] <Przemcio78> actually a wrong place to pose such questions
[10:48] <salim> SuSE is great, it has a cool repair system, if you destroy your linux...
[10:48] <koshea> hi, can anyone help me with setting up a wireless connection in ubuntu?  its not connecting and i cant figure out why
[10:49] <gnomefreak> hfhf: aktiwers deema salim stay on topic or join #ubuntu-offtopic for those topics

[10:49] <koshea> hi, can anyone help me with setting up a wireless connection in ubuntu?  its not connecting and i cant figure out why
[10:50] <aktiwers> About my java problem..  I have read that info, but stell dont seam to understand what is wrong. How do I copy code here without breaking the rules?
[10:50] <mc44> koshea: what does iwconfig say?
[10:50] <gyaresu> !wireless > koshea
[10:50] <salim> koshea: try iwlist eth1 scanning (or eth0 or wlan0, whatever your wlan device is)
[10:50] <BoeB> hi guys, i found a strange bug, when i try to assign my preferred application for a file by right-clicking - then "preferences" - "open with" i cant set the point e.g. for an avi file to open with mplayer. the black dot is still at gstreamer. i also have a problem with editing the menu. sorry for bad english, please help!
[10:51] <koshea> mc44: it says on eth0 unassociated and then the ESSID of my network and all
[10:51] <koshea> salim, that works and it shows all the networks including mine
[10:51] <aktiwers> oops.. im in the wrong channel.. lol sorry
[10:51] <thomas_> hey guys, i'm having a problem with ubuntu's banshee package. First run, everything goes smoothly, but the second time trying to run banshee, it freezes at the point where it says "Initalizing background tasks" Any solution to this problem?
[10:51] <salim> I'm on livecd because ubuntu stuck in last boot-process, does it has a log file anywhere, so I can at least see why and where he stopped?
[10:51] <binyamin> anyone else have problems with their laptop battery and edgy?
[10:51] <thomas_> !anyone
[10:51] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:52] <gyaresu> thomas_, run it from a command line and note the output.
[10:52] <koshea> for some reason no networks show up in the list in the gnome network manager
[10:52] <mc44> salim: if you can access the drive with ubuntu on, the relevant logs should be in /var/log
[10:52] <SeAofSaRo> I keep getting Couldn't find package beryl when trying to apt-get install, any ideas?
[10:52] <binyamin> why is my laptop battery not being recognized at times?
[10:52] <bradley> i can't find the 'totem-xine-firefox-plugin' does it exist in edgy?
[10:52] <mc44> koshea: is a bug
[10:52] <gyaresu> SeAofSaRo, you need to add the repo.
[10:52] <BoeB> hi guys, i found a strange bug, when i try to assign my preferred application for a file by right-clicking - then "preferences" - "open with" i cant set the point e.g. for an avi file to open with mplayer. the black dot is still at gstreamer. i also have a problem with editing the menu. sorry for bad english, please help!
[10:53] <salim> which logfile is it, there are so many in var log
[10:53] <SeAofSaRo> gyaresu: the update doesn't do that, do I specify it somehow?
[10:53] <thomas_> (Banshee:17983): Gnome-WARNING **: Accessibility: failed to find module 'libgail-gnome' which is needed to make this application accessible
[10:53] <mc44> salim: well kern.log may be a good start
[10:53] <thomas_> i guess there's my answer.
[10:53] <gyaresu> SeAofSaRo, Are you following a howto?
[10:53] <thomas_> why it wasn't packaged with it is beyond me.
[10:53] <SeAofSaRo> ya, somewhat
[10:53] <sparr> is there a reason that the ubuntu mozilla-thunderbird package doesnt provide an icon for thunderbird?  i assume it has something to do with the debian non-free-art thing, but thats no reason to not have any icon at all
[10:53] <salim> !bootstrap.log
[10:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bootstrap.log - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:53] <gyaresu> SeAofSaRo, I could tell you but if you don't know then you really shouldn't be hacking your system...
[10:54] <mirak> is there a way to not have syslog clobbered by dropped paquets messages from the kernel ? same for dmesg
[10:54] <mc44> salim: or syslog
[10:54] <mirak> ?
[10:54] <hfhf> anyone here play warsow?
[10:54] <salim> the last time he logged was 3 hours ago, when I was still able to boot successfully
[10:55] <slimz> hey does anyone know if its easy or what work would be involved to get ubuntu up and running on an ibm r30 laptop, and get it onto a windows domain?
[10:55] <mc44> salim: syslog or kern.log?
[10:55] <^Ocean^> is there any programs to capture movies with my Webcam ?  i found several that will capture an image, but nothing that will do like a .avi or mpg movie
[10:55] <SeAofSaRo> gyaresu: i haven't been on ubuntu in a while, I'm back at the point where I'm confused about most things
[10:56] <hfhf> what do you use now?
[10:56] <mc44> salim: and where is the boot failing?
[10:56] <graveson> where can i go to find out if a certain piece of hardware is supported on ubunu
[10:56] <gyaresu> SeAofSaRo, Yeah, I kind of got that feeling. Try and make it stable rather than beta testing is my opinion.
[10:56] <graveson> *ubuntu
[10:56] <salim> syslog has also no usefull infos about last boot
[10:56] <salim> I dunno, all log files are too old
[10:56] <gyaresu> !hardware > graveson
[10:56] <SeAofSaRo> is beryl in beta?
[10:56] <gyaresu> SeAofSaRo, yes.
[10:56] <salim> they arent about the last unsuccessfull boot
[10:56] <SeAofSaRo> I just heard about it last night when I was looking at edgy, seems cool
[10:56] <graveson> !hardware
[10:56] <ubotu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
[10:56] <mc44> salim: yes, but what is the problem with booting?
[10:57] <salim> it stops when he shows ubuntu splash screen (I screwed up my ntfs partition)
[10:57] <salim> I already tried uncommenting the ntfs line in /etc/fstab, but it didnt help
[10:57] <gyaresu> graveson, you can just /msg uboto for yourself or redirect (>) it to someone else
[10:58] <mc44> salim: do you get a bootloader menu to chose what to boot into?
[10:58] <gyaresu> graveson, *ubotu
[10:58] <hfhf> does anyone think edgy was a crap upgrade?
[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> y0

[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> i got a problem with synaptic
[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> every time i try to use it
[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> it crashes
[10:59] <salim> yes I get into the grub menu
[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> is that because i set a root password?
[10:59] <^Ocean^> is there any programs to capture movies with my Webcam ?  i found several that will capture an image, but nothing that will do like a .avi or mpg movie
[10:59] <SCHNUPPI> maybe grub problem?
[10:59] <mc44> salim: have you tried rcovey mode opton?
[10:59] <salim> then I choose ubuntu, it shows ubuntu splash screen with little orange in the status bar and then it doesnt do anything, it doesnt even need a second
[11:00] <salim> what is recovery mode option?
=== SCHNUPPI is now known as jewslolwtclol
[11:00] <koshea> hi could anyone help me with getting my wireless to work?  and please dont just PM me to the man page, i need some help figuring out how to debug it because im not getting a connection nor am i getting any messages as to why (afaik)
[11:00] <mc44> salim: in the list there should be two ubuntu options, one which says recovery mode?
[11:01] <gyaresu> koshea, Where are you up to so far?
[11:01] <Siniestro> hola
[11:01] <peacekpr> i installed FrostWire and it says i have a firewall installed... it was working on my other kubuntu install with nothing different with the router

[11:03] <salim> how long is recovery mode going to take
[11:03] <LjL> jewslolwtclol: irc.ubuntu.com is an IRC server (well, an alias to one)
[11:04] <srf21c> that's the irc server that shows up by default in GAIM when you configure an IRC "account"
[11:04] <LjL> jewslolwtclol: and httpd config is probably the configuration file for an HTTP (Web) server
[11:04] <salim> it says the following: "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"

[11:20] <mc44> aro-ron: fixing what?
[11:21] <aro-ron> most everything is working fine, but I cannot seem to get my Thunderbird profile to restore back into the new install of thunderbird
[11:21] <aro-ron> it wont read the profile, and I cant figure out why
[11:21] <mc44> aro-ron: perhaps the permissions are wrong
[11:21] <meheren> can i buy muisc from iTunes music store on linux? and how do i play it?
[11:21] <aro-ron> mc44: how can I check those?
[11:22] <lupine_85> meheren: three lettters. DRM
[11:22] <lupine_85> you "could", but why should you?
[11:22] <mc44> aro-ron: right click on the file then properties, then permissions tab
[11:22] <lupine_85> buy your music from somewhere that doesn't force you to get reamed by sony :)
[11:23] <lostinc> Is there a large difference between distros designed for the i3286 and those designed for the i686
[11:23] <lupine_85> lostinc: some
[11:23] <lupine_85> the latter will be a bit faster
[11:23] <Trixsey> I've decided to get Ubuntu, yay!
[11:24] <pianoboy3333> lostinc: but you can get an i686 kernel for ubuntu
[11:24] <Trixsey> Now tell me which version I should be getting :D
[11:24] <lostinc> does that change it over?
[11:24] <lostinc> What about all the software compiled for i386 that is already installed
[11:24] <bokey> helo everyone.
[11:24] <StikkitJim> anyone got Ubuntu running running from a persistant live install on a usb drive? o_0
[11:25] <fuffe> hey, I have an issue..
[11:25] <porkpie__> hi guy's ....does the install of apache2 create a www group by default
[11:25] <Zarephath> What package do I need to setup the "X includes"? Trying to compile gnash for PPC so I can see flash stuff...
[11:26] <Trixsey> Do I get the DVD release or the CD release?
[11:26] <Music_Shuffle> Whichever you want really Trixsey
[11:26] <james296> can someone help me launching Quake 4? I JUST installed the latest nvidia driver for this, its lookin great, but when I launch Quake 4 it goes back to the logon screen automatically
[11:26] <porkpie__> I have installed apache2 using the apt-get install but I don't see any www group
[11:26] <Trixsey> Music_Shuffle: the difference being?
[11:26] <meheren> can i buy muisc from iTunes music store on linux? and how do i play it?
[11:26] <Music_Shuffle> I've no idea, the DVD ver probably has more preinstalled stuff?
[11:26] <thomas_> meheren: use banshee
[11:26] <meheren> lupino_85, what does DRM stand for...?
[11:26] <mc44> Trixsey: CD has the default install DVD has extra packages which are not installed
[11:26] <meheren> thomas_, ok thx
[11:27] <cafuego> or perhaps a player that doesn't require mono
[11:27] <Zarephath> !tell meheren about restricted formats
=== Hello_Kitty__ is now known as acidjames
[11:27] <Music_Shuffle> The CD version works well, so I've never messed with the DVD.  Just manually install whichevre others you need.
[11:27] <Trixsey> mc44: those extras anything worth installing?
[11:27] <aro-ron> mc44: checked permissions, and made sure they were set to me, but it still wont work, wont load the profile
[11:27] <menko> HI, how do I get thunar to open directories when media is inserteed instead of nautilus (apart from moving the nautilus in bin)?
[11:27] <fuffe> since I installed kde on ubuntu by writing apt-get install kde-desktop, I've got an issue in the gnome environment. It doesn't appear any turnoff or restart buttons when you click at the red power button in the upper right corner
[11:27] <mc44> Trixsey: well if there is anything you want you can install it over the internet anyway
[11:27] <Music_Shuffle> Trixsey: If you need them, you'll end up installing them anyways, if not, you'll end up removing them anyways.
[11:27] <meheren> Zarepath, thx
[11:27] <Trixsey> yeah
[11:27] <james296> WELL???
[11:27] <Zarephath> meheren:np
[11:27] <mc44> Trixsey: so its not worth getting the DVD unless you have bas bandwidth
[11:27] <Trixsey> k
[11:28] <james296> sorry but this is really annoying me and I need a response
[11:28] <xopher> my sound doesnt respond when I try to change the volume with my media keys, had this before, remember the fix was easy, but cant remember what I did, any ideas?
[11:28] <Trixsey> I'm downloading in 1.3MB/s from one of Ubuntus mirrors
[11:28] <Trixsey> so bandwidth is okay
[11:28] <Trixsey> but I'll jsut go with the CD
[11:28] <mc44> aro-ron: sorry dont know then
[11:28] <Trixsey> tired of all extras in windows as it is :P
[11:28] <Music_Shuffle> Heh. CD's aren't all out of date! ^^
[11:28] <skreet> Anyone using the new gnome on ubuntu yet? :D

[11:29] <lupine_85> fuffe: that's because you're using kdm rather than gdm now
[11:29] <Zarephath> nalioth: What do I need to do to get the X includes so I can compile gnash for ppc?
[11:29] <mikm[laptop] > skreet- New gnome?
[11:29] <lupine_85> dpkg-reconfigure gdm and change back to gdm as defaulr; that should fix it

[11:31] <Khale1> got a question regarding passwords and general ubuntu weirdness if anyone's got a minute (I might be doing something really stupid, so it might take a minute) if anyone's up for it?

[11:31] <mikm[laptop] > skreet- Oh.  I thought you were talking about a beta or something
[11:31] <mc44> skreet: are you running edgy
[11:31] <skreet> yea
[11:31] <skreet> how can ii tell what version of gnome i have then
[11:31] <nalioth> Zarephath: search in synaptic for xorg and install the -dev pkgs
[11:31] <mc44> skreet: then you have the lastest gnome :) woo!
[11:32] <Zarephath> nalioth: Kewl thanks
[11:32] <mc44> skreet: System -> About Gnome
[11:32] <skreet> hmm
[11:32] <skreet> i thought 2.16 was new
[11:32] <skreet> any way to use the gnome default art vs the ubuntu
[11:32] <mc44> skreet: it is
[11:32] <Khale1> ah ok sweet :). Basically I recently got an r100 toshiba. Now the r100 doesn't have a cd or other optical drive so I installed ubuntu using winlux (it had windows preinstalled)
[11:32] <Zarephath> nalioth: actually I will just apt-cache search xorg then install ;-)

[11:33] <Khale1> everything went well except I installed beryl and everything's screwed up. I can't even access anything as root. The password which is the same as my normal login doesn't work for some reason

[11:34] <shira> Hi, when I try to boot using the 386 kernel, I get a "no screen found" error, but this doesn't happen if I use the "generic" one. Any ideas why?
[11:34] <Khale1> there's only one password for the main user and root, so anything that requires admin rights comes up with an incorrect password
[11:34] <Alakazamz0r> lupine_85, mine has 7 digits
[11:34] <Alakazamz0r> yours has 76
[11:34] <Alakazamz0r> ack 6 ;)
[11:34] <allen2003> hello how to play mp3 with ubuntu xD
[11:34] <Khale1> anyone have any idea how to reset things?
[11:34] <Alakazamz0r> 1,946,424
[11:34] <allen2003> how to play mp3?
[11:34] <LjL> Khale1, you don't have a root password, so it's not the same as your normal user's - it's just that your normal user is a member of the "admin" group, and as such can use "sudo", which gives it root privileges
[11:34] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Khale1 about root
[11:34] <Khale1> yeah sudo doesn't work
[11:35] <bokey> !mp3 > allen2003
[11:35] <allen2003> Ubotu, please tell allen2003 about mp3
[11:35] <Khale1> that's where I'm going with it
[11:35] <runpain> hello again
[11:35] <LjL> Khale1, don't know why this would have happened, but perhaps you're not a member of admin anymore. try typing "groups" and see if "admin" is listed

[11:36] <LjL> Khale1: then i guess lupine_85 is right and sudo is broken. what happens when you try "sudo true"?
[11:36] <allen2003> mp3 restricted?
[11:36] <mc44> runpain: might want to change your password there
[11:36] <allen2003> what palyer i can use for mp3?
[11:36] <skreet> allen2003, AmaroK is nice.
[11:36] <pianoboy3333> runpain: forgot a / ?
[11:36] <allen2003> ok
[11:36] <lupine_85> Real Users seta root password just in case

[11:37] <inferiorpotassiu> what is the apt package for mathematica fonts?
[11:37] <srf21c> dude! all these IRC messages of poeple entering and leaving the room is driving me crazy.  Anyone know a command to these messages off?
[11:37] <allen2003> lol lame

[11:37] <skreet> srf21c, Depends on your client.
[11:37] <pianoboy3333> inferiorpotassiu: use apt-cache search
[11:37] <Khale1> asks me for the password and then obviously tells me it's a failed attempt
[11:37] <inferiorpotassiu> pianoboy3333: i've done that already

[11:38] <Khale1> is there any way of starting everything fresh and installing ubuntu again as with winlux?
[11:38] <inferiorpotassiu> on gentoo there's a package called mathematica-fonts, nothing like that is available on ubuntu?
[11:38] <runpain> always happens to me as a newbie
[11:38] <inferiorpotassiu> and, i already have that font set on this computer
[11:38] <lupine_85> good job it's not your email password as well... or I'd 0wn j00r msn :p
[11:38] <srf21c> Lemme dig around again real quick.  .  Prefs for IRC on GAIM seem somewhat limited.
[11:38] <pianoboy3333> inferiorpotassiu: doubt it... if you can get the source from the gentoo repositories, you can use the font files
[11:38] <LjL> Khale1: i don't even know what winlux is honestly and couldn't find many references to it... but anyway, you should be able to start Ubuntu in recovery mode and get root. from there, you can check what's going wrong with sudo... not sure what it could be honestly
[11:38] <mc44> srf21c: get xchat if you want fuller functionality
[11:39] <inferiorpotassiu> pianoboy3333: i guess that's how it'll have to be, but i'd kind of expect that some people use mathematica and ubuntu...?
[11:39] <inferiorpotassiu> pianoboy3333: it's a much uglier solution to use another operating system's files, especially if an existing solution is there
[11:39] <srf21c> yeah, thought about xchat.  I'm a minimalist though, and I'd hate to install another program just to run IRC.
[11:39] <allen2003> so i got problem on limewire
[11:39] <pianoboy3333> inferiorpotassiu: it may be out there, you have to look harder
[11:39] <allen2003> the readme said i need to put java inside the folder
[11:39] <allen2003> so where can i  find java
[11:39] <mc44> srf21c: ah I thought the linux philosophy was do one thing and do it well :)
[11:40] <Khale1> ah worry winlux is an exe that basically you load from windows ( i had it installed on the machine first) and from there it basically reboots the machine (changes grub I guess) and allows you to install ubuntu without an optical medium.
[11:40] <allen2003> !java
[11:40] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:40] <Khale1> starts it off with a text based interface and downloads all the packages there and then
[11:40] <Khale1> should be something similar for ubuntu right?

[11:49] <clearzen> Zarephath: I can live without x for a while. I'm sure I could repair any damage I do. I just haven't edited that file before. what section do I need to edit?
[11:49] <strabes> flodine: do you have the footprint .png?
[11:49] <allen2003> edit preferences?
[11:49] <santeria[FL] > ok i got the 64 bit text installer but i have no idea how to partition my hard drive
[11:49] <vasilis> strabes: try passing vga=077 or someting like that to your kernel
[11:49] <flodine> strabes no
[11:49] <strabes> vasilis: how do i do that?
[11:49] <mc44> vasilis: see upstart.ubuntu.com
[11:49] <srf21c> so has anyone been able to get the nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-source packakges properly install on Edgy?
[11:49] <flodine> strabes no cammand
[11:49] <Zarephath> nalioth: I came across a sticky in the PPC forum talking about a bug in the smp kernel for powerpc..it this good information? As I have a PowerPC dual and am currently running the smp kernel without issue

[11:49] <vasilis> mc44: cheers man
[11:50] <Zarephath> clearzen, : Ok all you need to do is look for...ummm just a sec
[11:50] <allen2003> ah
[11:50] <allen2003> ok tnx
[11:50] <Drudwyn> hey there!
[11:50] <lupine_85> sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) nvidia-glx
[11:50] <vasilis> strabes: when you are in the grub boot menu try pressing the e button and add it
[11:50] <lupine_85> problem solved
[11:50] <strabes> flodine: then how do you expect to change it to the foot if you don't have a png to change it to? you can see my blog post about this here: http://strabes.wordpress.com/2006/10/16/change-the-menu-bar-logo-on-ubuntu-dapper/
[11:50] <srf21c> when I try to install the nvidia packages, apt keeps trying to load the 386 kernel headers.  And fails.
[11:50] <nalioth> Zarephath: as am I. no issues at all
[11:51] <nalioth> Zarephath: of course, i'm on dapper still
[11:51] <santeria[FL] > ok i got the 64 bit text installer but i have no idea how to partition my hard drive<<<----
[11:51] <srf21c> thanks lupine, I'll try that right now.  That's not going to roll my kernel back to 386, is it?
[11:51] <Lattyware> Anyone: Suggestions for help with integrated intel graphics?
[11:51] <vasilis> strabes: i am not sure about the 077 though,
[11:51] <strabes> vasilis: ok i'll look it up
[11:51] <strabes> thanks though
[11:51] <Zarephath> nalioth: Ok thanks...yeah this was an older post about dapper actually....
[11:51] <santeria[FL] > anybody?
[11:51] <Zarephath> clearzen, : give me another second..I have to fire up my PC...
[11:52] <clearzen> Zarephath: That's fine. Thank you for the help
[11:52] <jason> edgy, using compiz how do I load a new plugin?
[11:52] <mc44> srf21c: no it wont.
[11:52] <clearzen> Zarephath: If it breaks I just made a backup of my system anyway
[11:52] <srf21c> kewl.
[11:52] <santeria[FL] > whenever i try to partition the biggest section (~180 gb) no matter what value i put, it doesnt do anything'
[11:53] <vasilis> i must say edgy is a bit buggy..
[11:53] <mc44> srf21c: (iz a bug https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17/+bug/68621)
[11:53] <Zarephath> clearzen, : Heh thats the spirit...
[11:53] <srf21c> alright, the install finished.  What's the command to enable the nvidia drivers again? I forgot the exec is three or four words long.
[11:53] <mc44> vasilis: its not too bad
[11:54] <jason> mc44, yes it is.. but it is edgy isnt it
[11:54] <Zarephath> Ok so am I fscked up here or what...isn't inittab in edgy?
[11:54] <vasilis> had a few problems with my wifi card,problems with the bluetooth,and the nvidia gf7400...No sound as well..
[11:54] <mc44> jason: its all relative :p
[11:54] <skreet> anyone know of a good guide for ipw3945
[11:55] <skreet> i've got the driver and module loaded, etc.
[11:55] <mc44> vasilis: well thats your fault for having annoying hardware :p
[11:55] <skreet> no eth1/ra0
[11:55] <srf21c> mc44:, that's for digging up the documentation.
[11:55] <santeria[FL] > whenever i try to partition the biggest section (~180 gb) no matter what value i put, it doesnt do anything any ideas?
[11:55] <Drudwyn> Hey guys, when I try to reload Synaptic, I get an error message, saying repository might no longer be available or could not be contacted. I've got full signal and can access the web, and it's happening everytime...
[11:55] <vasilis> and now this new upstart thingy...What's the problem with sysv?
[11:55] <jason> mc44, not saying its any thing big just the little things.... like always scanning a fat32 partition on every boot by default
[11:55] <Drudwyn> can anyone suggest what might be up with it?
[11:55] <srf21c> I was following the steps in the Ubuntu guide for Edgy, and was a little bewildered when the install choked.
[11:55] <mc44> vasilis: upstart isnt buggy :p its event based, which means it can handle hotplug on bott and so forth
[11:56] <vasilis> mc44: hotplug?That's obsolete
[11:56] <srf21c> ok, I found the command to enable the nvidia driver  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[11:56] <ahaller> Drudwyn: Have you added custom repositories? Maybe one has got wrong url.
[11:56] <Zarephath> clearzen, : I stand corrected...it appears you can do init followed by the runlevel..on most linux systems a init 3 puts the system to boot to login prompt..after logging in a init 5 would be issued to put it back to startx..however I am not 100% sure about the default runlevels in Ubuntu..so better ask first
[11:57] <mc44> vasilis:  mean hotplugging tings in raher tan uing hotplug :p itsall udev now :)
[11:57] <Drudwyn> I haven't, it even threw the same message after install
[11:57] <mc44> vasilis: wow lost lots of keys there
[11:57] <dibblego> why do I get 403 Forbidden responses when I apt-get update?
[11:57] <vasilis> mc44:  eitherway i've seen distrols like suse that do that using sysv
[11:57] <srf21c> and it failed!  Results:  Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[11:57] <srf21c> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[11:57] <srf21c> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[11:57] <srf21c> command:
[11:57] <srf21c> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[11:57] <srf21c> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[11:57] <srf21c> from nv to nvidia.
[11:57] <flaco> hi all... when I try to run vnc or DrScheme, show me this error Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font --- any ideas/
[11:57] <flaco> ?
[11:57] <vasilis> mc44: i got your point
[11:57] <mc44> vasilis: upstart is a more elegant solution
[11:57] <nalioth> srf21c: please use a pastebin next time
[11:58] <srf21c> going to try manually editing xorg.conf then rebooting.  Last time I did this it choked trying to load the GDM thought.  See y'all in a bit.
[11:58] <srf21c> yeah, sorry nalioth, I'm brand new to IRC.  DIdn't know it was going to do that.
[11:58] <clearzen> Zarephath: I'll try it out...I'll get it to run eventually. I have heard that ubuntu handles run level differently. But I don't know because I haven't delt with them much. Other than to shutdown and reboot
[11:58] <lullabud> flaco:  font problems are common when connecting to remote machines.  search for that font and install it.
[11:59] <lullabud> flaco:  try `apt-cache search ISO8859`
[11:59] <vasilis> mc44: is it mature enough?I don't see volkerding using it ;)
[11:59] <srf21c> nalioth:  I'm using GAIM for IRC client too, so I'm not sure if pastebin is a feature on this client.
[11:59] <srf21c> BRB
[11:59] <Zarephath> clearzen, : Well like I said once you know the runlevel to boot to prompt and then back to X all you have to issue is sudo init <runlevel> then you can work on unistalling the via stuff and adding whatever back in..
[11:59] <skreet> pastebin isn't a client feature..
[11:59] <hemal> looking for a little help, i've been trying to install beryl on edgy and have added lots of repos from many guides
[11:59] <clearzen> Zarephath: Thanks again
[12:00] <hemal> does anyone have the original list of repositories?
[12:00] <mc44> vasilis: well its not exactly what you would call mature, oit was written in the 4 months before edgy :P but it is surprisingly bug free
[12:00] <santeria[FL] > whenever i try to partition the biggest section (~180 gb) no matter what value i put, it doesnt do anything any ideas?
[12:00] <Zarephath> clearzen, : NP I have had lots of people help me as well...glad I had a little bit of information at least...
[12:00] <nalioth> !tell hemal about repos
[12:00] <Drudwyn> nope, gb, archive and security.ubuntu/~ all fail
