[12:01] <AliTaimur> i tried al+ctrl+f1 nothing happened :-(
[12:01] <vgoltser> ali, this is in edgy?
[12:01] <delight> hi ... i installed some packages to edgy ... quite some ;) ... and one of them made most folders beeing hidden  ... its kinda nice on the one hand ... but then its pretty annonying if u browse with konqueror or so ...
[12:01] <delight> does somebody know what package it is that makes that behaviour ?
[12:01] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, was your .mozilla/ a fresh from a clean edgy install or was it dragged along from an older system
[12:01] <AliTaimur> yes its edgy
[12:01] <AliTaimur> and i m using kubuntu
=== dwight is now known as DShepherd
[12:02] <valberg> cge: and then what ?
[12:02] <vgoltser> wtf?! did they disable vitual consoles?!
[12:02] <noldon> why doesnt the program i install with synaptic being added to the "application" meny?
[12:02] <variant> vgoltser: no...
[12:02] <cge> valberg: That's it
[12:02] <valberg> cge: then just remove it ?
[12:02] <leofender> can i chating with other person with the linux console ?
[12:02] <cge> valberg: Just do that, and then remove it, yes.
[12:02] <LjL> vgoltser: uh, you're already (well, ali's already) the second user saying they can't access VTs tonight...
[12:02] <AngryElf> is there a way i can change the size of the desktop icons?
[12:02] <variant> leofender: yeah, man write
[12:02] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; it was a new
[12:02] <variant> leofender: or talk
[12:03] <nomasteryoda> noldon, its there ... just run this command... killall -9 gnome-panel ... this should update it
[12:03] <leofender> yeah ?
[12:03] <vgoltser> ali, file a bug or if you can get to the partition, see if there is something towards the end of the /etc/inittab file mentioning tty1, tty2, until tty6 and see if they are commented (# in front of the line) if they are, un comment them
[12:03] <leofender> how ?
[12:03] <Zyfo> When I've got autohide on a panel I need to hold the mouse over it for a while until it shows. How can I decrease the time needed to show the panel?
[12:03] <ibob63> doesn't anyone know a good gui for ffmpeg?
[12:03] <variant> q
[12:03] <LjL> vgoltser: err, there is no /etc/inittab anymore in Edgy =)
[12:03] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell vgoltser about upstart
[12:03] <leofender> hablas espaol ?
[12:03] <rawrness> how well would konqueror work in gnome?
[12:03] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, k. what was that link again? i'm going to give it some serious testing
[12:03] <variant> leofender: "write username"
[12:03] <valberg> cge, thanks!
[12:03] <noldon> AngryElf right-click the icon and click stretch icon
[12:03] <vgoltser> ahh ... this is bad ...
[12:03] <ibob63> opps.. does any anyone know a good gui for ffmpeg?
[12:03] <variant> leofender: then enter what you want to say and thoen do ctrl d
[12:03] <nomasteryoda> rawrness, works for me
[12:04] <vgoltser> they should've skipped this one and had edgy as 7.04
[12:04] <rawrness> kk
[12:04] <cge> valberg: There might be some files left over that didn't get removed, but it will at least fix apt.
[12:04] <pike_> ibob63: soundkonverter?
[12:04] <leofender> 4variant. give me your hotmail acount
[12:04] <valberg> cge, the package acpid and acpi-support are bothering me as well
[12:04] <variant> leofender: type man write for full information
[12:04] <noldon> nomasteryoda yeahh right or maybe its just kills my toolbar
[12:04] <variant> leofender: give me some money
[12:04] <valberg> cge, are they important ?
[12:04] <ibob63> pike_: will that work on gnome?
[12:04] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; it is definitly a bug, rename your old .mozilla, let create a new one, and it will not work
[12:04] <AngryElf> noldon, i was looking for more of a permanent setting for all icons....and new ones to come
[12:04] <j-swim> anyone ever setup ivtv for a hauppauge card in ubuntu? I'm trying to build the module but I dont know where to firmware files. I installed the ivtv-source package in the repos, and extracted them in /usr/src... help?
[12:04] <nomasteryoda> noldon, it will but also the gnome-panel will restart "automagically"
[12:04] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/80176
[12:04] <dcraven> AngryElf, default zoom level in Nautilus preferences.
[12:04] <leofender> plis a need to know that
[12:04] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; and then blackstone
[12:04] <leofender> i need you email
[12:04] <pike_> ibob63: it will load kde libs but yeah
[12:04] <nomasteryoda> i've used it before
[12:04] <cge> valberg: You want them installed, probably.
[12:04] <noldon> nomasteryoda i dont trust u
[12:05] <vgoltser> is there a reason why my usb mouse would switch events between boots (sometimes event1, sometimes event2)
[12:05] <valberg> cge, k... it just fails to set them up... :S
[12:05] <ibob63> pike_: i'll give it a go :) thanks
[12:05] <variant> leofender: ok, its suckmydogswang@hotmail.com
[12:05] <Dragonfire1> If I install ubuntu full to the hard disk. Then can you re partion again for another flavor like edubuntu?
[12:05] <vgoltser> reason is, I use evdev and X fails if the config is wrong
[12:05] <cge> valberg: You might try reinstalling them
[12:05] <cge> valberg: If that fails, you could post the error in #flood
[12:05] <leofender> wait
[12:05] <Dragonfire1> I want to split the hard drive 20 and 20 gig
[12:05] <leofender> please
[12:05] <moolcool_> how do i switch from kdm to gdm?
[12:05] <mikm[laptop] > Dragonfire1-  Yes
[12:05] <LjL> moolcool_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
[12:06] <nashnash> how can i set my pc (xsane,kooka .. any scanning prog) to scan on black and white and not making the background of the scan blue? Thanks!
[12:06] <pike_> i just got the the virgin islands and first thing i do is ssh to home comp and fire up irssi.. thats just sad
[12:06] <AngryElf> dcraven, where are the nautilus prefs?
[12:06] <Dragonfire1> mikm here is the situation I trie to run_qtparted
[12:06] <moolcool_> how do i switch from kdm to gdm?
[12:06] <LjL> moolcool_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm <-- i just answered
[12:06] <DShepherd> moolcool_: do you have kubuntu instaleed?
[12:06] <Dragonfire1> I need to keep the fat in front I believe
[12:06] <moolcool_> i am running in gnome
[12:06] <lando> i have apache2 and mysql installed however when i reboot apache2 runs but not mysql.... what file do i need to edit?
[12:06] <Dragonfire1> WInd was on the drive already
[12:06] <delight> so does somebody know a package in edgy that is marking pretty much all folders in the main folder as hidden ?
[12:07] <Dragonfire1> windows
[12:07] <dcraven> AngryElf, Places -> Home Folder, then Edit -> Preferences
[12:07] <moolcool_> but it says kbuntu when it boots
[12:07] <dcraven> AngryElf, in the View tab.
[12:07] <cge> delight: It is a kubuntu package, I believe.
[12:07] <cge> delight: You can fix the problem by deleting the /.hidden file.
[12:07] <LjL> moolcool_, the splash screen you see during boot has nothing to do with KDM and GDM
[12:07] <variant> delight: the default in your home directory is to have most files hidden with a . at the start
[12:07] <LjL> moolcool_: to switch to GDM, do what i said.
[12:07] <delight> cge .. could be ... but  its kinda annoying ... not talking about the home folder
[12:07] <leofender> Hi
[12:07] <variant> cge: dont delet them as this will break your applications
[12:07] <AngryElf> dcraven, awesome, thanx
[12:07] <delight> thats ok ...
[12:07] <mikm[laptop] > Dragonfire1 -  Just resize the (k)ubuntu partition.  You shouldn't have to add another swap partition
[12:07] <j-swim> anyone ever setup ivtv for a hauppauge card in ubuntu? I'm trying to build the module but I dont know where to firmware files. I installed the ivtv-source package in the repos, and extracted them in /usr/src... help?
[12:07] <moolcool_> how do i change back to the old splash screen?
[12:07] <cge> variant: I'm talking about something completely different.
[12:08] <LjL> moolcool_: to change the splashscreen, i think it's "sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash", or possibly "sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash-theme-ubuntu"
[12:08] <dcraven> AngryElf, np
[12:08] <leofender> Variant!
[12:08] <variant> cge: ok, explain
[12:08] <cge> variant: Deleting /.hidden won't break anything
[12:08] <moolcool_> ok thx
[12:08] <cge> variant: I don't mean ~/.hidden
[12:08] <variant> cge: yes it will.. (firefox for example
[12:08] <noldon> nomasteryoda u were right it did restarted but the programs i installed didnt get into the meny
[12:08] <Dragonfire1> oh okay assumed you had to have two swaps
[12:08] <Dragonfire1> I will look at that
[12:08] <leofender> hey variant, are you there?
[12:08] <delight> oh you right .. there is a .hidden file
[12:08] <variant> cge: by break i mean remove your config etc
[12:08] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, bug confirmed. congrats :)
[12:08] <cge> variant, delight: I mean the literal file /.hidden. It causes nautilus and konqueror to hide things listed in that file.
[12:08] <vgoltser> have fun everyone ...
[12:08] <variant> cge: so, explain what you do mean
[12:08] <leofender> how can I do for chat using the console
[12:09] <j0sh-> anybody else having problems with upgrading?
[12:09] <variant> cge: i have neverheard of that
[12:09] <LjL> !hidden-root | variant, delight, cge
[12:09] <ubotu> variant, delight, cge: Kubuntu Edgy has implemented a new feature that hides most of the filesystem. For more information: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuHiddenFiles
[12:09] <variant> cge: so rm /.hidden
[12:09] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, have you filed it? would you like to file it, or should i
[12:09] <j0sh-> once i restarted, nothing worked at all :P said video errors, but yet i couldnt get a shell, or anything to try to fix it
[12:09] <variant> LjL: how annoying!
[12:09] <cge> variant: Yes. But it only is there in kubuntu, as a new "feature"
[12:09] <variant> LjL: i dont use kubuntu
[12:09] <Dragonfire1> I will go try this taka a look
[12:09] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; you can do if you like
[12:09] <valberg> cge, it worked :) thanks a lot... you just saved my sleep :)
[12:09] <variant> cge: yeah, isee why that would annoy you
[12:09] <LjL> variant: i'm unsure whether it's really a kubuntu-only feature, actually
[12:09] <noldon> leofender irssi
[12:09] <variant> ok
[12:09] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; i think i won't
[12:09] <Dragonfire1> thanks
[12:09] <LjL> variant: (though i do use kubuntu, so i can't be sure either way)
[12:10] <cge> LjL: It is only there if you install kubuntu-desktop, if I recall correctly.
[12:10] <LjL> cge: but then also affects Gnome?
[12:10] <delight> yes .. i found it its the sym-link in / called .hidden linking to /etc/kubuntu-default-settings/hidden-root ... its a nice idea ... but it would be nice if the tree-view on the left in konqueror would still sync then even when I'm in hidden folders
[12:10] <leofender> hey
[12:10] <leofender> what's irssi?
[12:10] <cge> LjL: Yes. Both konqueror and nautilus respect .hidden files, but kubuntu puts the .hidden file in /
[12:10] <noldon> anyone here that knows how i can solve my problem
[12:11] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, that's a cute little bug you found. i'll file it sometime today after checking for duplicates
[12:11] <ryanakca> leofender: irssi is a command line irc client
[12:11] <delight> besides that I liked the idea of hidding most of the system .. as u usually don't need to access all the time .. esp for "normal" users ;)
[12:11] <cge> noldon: What is your problem?
[12:11] <LjL> cge: i'm wondering how long the support for this /.hidden file has been in Gnome and KDE (without it being used by Ubuntu)
[12:11] <dnite> ok. I haven't had any problems before today, but Firefox has just frozen my computer solid about 6 times now. My mouse still moves. The system still works in the background (i unplugged a harddrive and got messages that said i should have hit eject), but the system doesn't respond to the mouse or keyboard at all.. anyone else run into this problem? The only thing that changed today was an adblock plus update in firefox..
[12:11] <leofender> I have started it
[12:11] <leofender> but I do not know how to use it
[12:11] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; ok, bye
[12:11] <leofender> could you help me please?
[12:11] <cge> LjL: Quite a while. I recall hearing about it during the early days of nautilus.
[12:11] <leofender> if you want to
[12:11] <mamzers555> DarkMageZ; i have to go
[12:12] <LjL> dnite: well, in case you don't know, you can (hopefully) restart the X server by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. then i don't know about your problem
[12:12] <Jestre> Anyone know if EAP_FAST authentication is finally included in wpa_supplicant on Edgy?
[12:12] <DarkMageZ> mamzers555, cya
[12:12] <cge> LjL: It has probably been there since nautilus was being released by that company whose name I now forget.
[12:12] <Halpo> is the desktop environment built into the OS when its distributed?
[12:12] <noldon> cge some of the programs i install does not adding to the application menu
[12:12] <LjL> cge: <offtopic> then if it's been there for that long, and never been used since, perhaps there's a reason why it's never been used</offtopic>
[12:12] <leofender> ok
[12:12] <cge> noldon: Have you tried restarting the panel, with killall gnome-panel?
[12:13] <valberg> where do i find the xorg log file *?
[12:13] <savvas> Halpo: if you choose the desktop version, yes
[12:13] <valberg> ?*
[12:13] <leofender> thatks anyways
[12:13] <leofender> I'll look the answer in google.com
[12:13] <cafuego> valberg: in /var/log
[12:13] <leofender> lol
[12:13] <vidd> halpo: no, it is a program that runs on top of the operating system
[12:13] <dnite> LjL, I actually haven't tried to restart the x server with ctrl alt backspace.. i've tried alt f4, alt f2, alt f1..  and i've tried to get to another console with ctrl alt f1. nothing responds..
=== luisbg is now known as luisbg_zZzZZzZz
[12:13] <LjL> Halpo, how do you define "built into the OS"? yes, the Ubuntu CD comes with Gnome shipped and it'll install it by default, and similarly does the Kubuntu CD with KDE
[12:13] <leofender> hey
[12:13] <cge> leofender: Ah. Look for the irssi website, and I believe there is a tutorial.
[12:13] <Halpo> i mean is there a way to setup a system that starts up linux, and then when a user login it runs with there setting for desktop environment
[12:13] <noldon> cge yes
[12:14] <cge> noldon: What programs aren't showing up?
[12:14] <Halpo> or is it not that abstracted from the OS
[12:14] <LjL> dnite: *shrugs* try uninstalling that adblock thing. i don't really know :-\
[12:14] <leofender> could somebody tell me what's the partition software for kde?
[12:14] <silox> I have a Dell Dimension 8100 with an extra screen connected to the monitor port ( the primary lcd screen is disabled) now i have a TV Out SVIDEO contact on the laptop too, but how do i make my box to send a clone of my desk to the TV? OR any image at all.. I have Nvidia drivers installed..
[12:14] <leofender> thanks noldon
[12:14] <vidd> halpo yes....install all the desktop environment
[12:14] <delight> !hidden-root
[12:14] <ubotu> Kubuntu Edgy has implemented a new feature that hides most of the filesystem. For more information: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuHiddenFiles
[12:14] <rob2929> hi, i just asked this, but my irc program had quit due to shareware expiration. so i deleted my linux partition but my ntfs still boots with grub, and i need to use my windows install CD, i have gotten this far, what should i do with it?
[12:14] <LjL> Halpo: you mean, have users select their preferred desktop environment? of course.
[12:14] <noldon> cge some games i just installed dont remember all of them
[12:14] <cge> noldon: Just some of them will do.
[12:14] <leofender> could somebody tell me what's the partition software for kde?
[12:15] <j0sh-> the new upstart worked, but i never got a terminal, i just got a weird looking error, everything was X's (xserver error), but i couldnt get a terminal to fix anything :/
[12:15] <LjL> Halpo: just have the user click on the Options button in the login screen, and select KDE (or Gnome) before they login. it'll stick for next logins
[12:15] <lupine_85> leofender: fdisk ? ;)
[12:15] <vidd> halpo on boot up, you should be able to choose witch desktop environment you want to run
[12:15] <lupine_85> otherwise qparted
[12:15] <noldon> cge but none of them have
[12:15] <lupine_85> !qparted
[12:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about qparted - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:15] <LjL> Halpo: of course, you'll need to have the relevant desktop environments installed

[12:15] <leofender> ahh yes
[12:15] <cge> noldon: I mean, if you could give me the names of the ones you remember. Were they from the package manager, or somewhere else?
[12:15] <leofender> just like MS DOShaha
[12:15] <leofender> thank you
[12:15] <lupine_85> ah, alrighty
[12:15] <pipak_> hello, could someone help me with a problem with debootstrap? :)
[12:16] <cge> pipak_: Yes :)
[12:16] <lupine_85> leofender: linux fdisk is a lot more powerful
[12:16] <nashnash> how can i set my pc (xsane,kooka .. any scanning prog) to scan on black and white and not making the background of the scan blue? Thanks!
[12:16] <lupine_85> if you're not sure, probably best to use the (yuck) GUI frontend
[12:16] <cge> lupine_85: Actually, I don't think it is.
[12:16] <leofender> linux itself is a lot more powerfull
[12:16] <Halpo> so when you boot the OS you want from the bootloader, when the ubuntu screen comes up and starts loading drivers, etc., where would you select?
[12:16] <cge> lupine_85: parted is probably more powerful though.
[12:16] <LjL> lupine_85, leofender: "cfdisk" is a bit of a middle ground between the user-unfriendly fdisk and the bells-and-whistles GUI programs like QTParted and GParted
[12:16] <lupine_85> cge: I never saw windows fdisk let you set partition type the way linux fdisk does
[12:16] <savvas> Halpo: you can run a desktop environment with startx, now to specifically adjust it to run for each user, i don't really know, :\
[12:17] <cge> lupine_85: Oh, I thought you were comparing qparted and fdisk.
[12:17] <rob2929> can anyone help, i removed my linux partition and my windows starts with "grub" but wont boot, how do i restore it?
[12:17] <noldon> in synaptic and one of them was 3dchess
[12:17] <lupine_85> I also never saw it sync the partition table without needing a reboot ;)
[12:17] <lupine_85> erm, no, just the fdisks :)
[12:17] <cge> lupine_85: The obviously the linux fdisk is more powerful, yes. Sorry for misunderstanding you.
[12:17] <LjL> rob2929: reinstall Ubuntu, or if you don't want to do that, use the "fixmbr" command from the Windows restore CD's console mode
[12:18] <cge> pipak_: What problem are you having with deboostrap?
[12:18] <rob2929> LjL, thank you  I will try that
[12:18] <messi> hi, how is best kubuntu or ubuntu
[12:18] <dkr> What does a dash mean in a checkbox? (as opposed to a check mark or blank)  (trying out the "software sources" tool, which also defaulted to slovenia for download source for some strange reason(sources.list has us.archive.ubuntu)
[12:18] <leofender> I'll try with fdisk
[12:18] <PPAAUULL> My boot splash doesn't show up can it be fixed?
[12:18] <LjL> !best | messi
[12:18] <ubotu> messi: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[12:18] <leofender> ahh
[12:18] <macphil> hi, does anyone know the standart option for an raid0 from 6.06 alternate chunk-size ?
[12:18] <noldon> cge and gnuchess
[12:18] <lupine_85> messi: KDE :p
[12:18] <lupine_85> Linus Torvalds says so, so it must be true ;)
[12:18] <leofender> I've got to compile a C program, but I have to compile it using borlan for windows
[12:18] <LjL> leofender: why?
[12:19] <lupine_85> leofender: they have a version of C++ builder for linux
[12:19] <lupine_85> that might work
[12:19] <leofender> because in y university they use windows
[12:19] <cge> messi: Asking that is like asking what religion is best, and can result in the same sorts of hostility.
[12:19] <savvas> messi: kubuntu has kde, a lot of sexy features, and gnome is good and not so full-of-apps.. your choice actually, but kde has more eye-candy :p
[12:19] <leofender> yeah
[12:19] <leofender> butr I don't wanna pay
[12:19] <lupine_85> otherwise, if it compiles with ANSI C, you should be fine with gcc
[12:19] <Landon> Hey all, How do you set up ubuntu so that I can see a windows network? I have already done sudo apt-get install samba and it's already gone through that, I'm trying to figure out the next step. The windows network is already up, now I just need to get into it
[12:19] <leofender> yes
[12:19] <lupine_85> personal edition of kylix is "free"
[12:19] <lupine_85> but only as in beer
[12:19] <leofender> but I cannot use CONIO.H in gcc
[12:19] <cge> noldon: Gnuchess won't show up because it is a console program, if I recall.
[12:19] <macphil> or is ther a posiblilty to get my old softraid settings autoanalysed
[12:19] <Halpo> why are programs separated by desktop environment as well....meaning...why are there different software distributed with kubuntu and ubuntu
[12:19] <cge> noldon: Try running it in a terminal.
[12:19] <lupine_85> leofender: you can
[12:20] <leofender> how?
[12:20] <nashnash> Landon go to system -> administration -> shared folders
[12:20] <lupine_85> you just need to specify the path to the include
[12:20] <leofender> i tried
[12:20] <baconbacon> Landon: using nautilus, smb://myhost/myshare
[12:20] <LjL> leofender: no you can't, because "CONIO.H" is not a standard ANSI C header, and it's basically only supported under MS-DOS for all i know
[12:20] <leofender> ahh
[12:20] <cge> noldon: And the others might not show up because they are in universe and not properly configured to show up.
[12:20] <leofender> sdo I was right
[12:20] <savvas> Halpo: because ubuntu is based on gnome, and kubuntu on kde desktop
[12:20] <baconbacon> Landon: or complete: smb://user@myhost/myshare
[12:20] <leofender> but how can I do to use some functions as getch();
[12:20] <LjL> lupine_85, no, there's no such thing as a conio.h in standard C -- the closest thing we have in Linux is probably curses
[12:20] <lupine_85> really?! ee had
[12:20] <lupine_85> gad*
[12:20] <savvas> Halpo: each desktop has different apps and ways to support them
[12:20] <noldon> yeah it was
[12:20] <lupine_85> curses != conio
[12:20] <leofender> because they will run my program in windows
[12:20] <pipak_> cge: basically I'm trying to install ubuntu with debootstrap, unfortunately I feel something is quite wrong: when I invoke the command with debootstrap --arch i386 edgy /target (name of the webserver), it says retrieving release, then package, then validating packages, resolving dependencies of required packages and then of base packages and it stop there
[12:20] <noldon> how about 3dchess
[12:20] <LjL> leofender: you don't, you use different functions
[12:20] <leofender> and I want to get an A+
[12:21] <leofender> ok
[12:21] <LjL> lupine_85: i said "the closest", not "the same thing"
[12:21] <Halpo> yeah....but how does the desktop environment affect a programs operation
[12:21] <lupine_85> nothing like, IIRC :D
[12:21] <leofender> but these functions won't work with borland
[12:21] <LjL> leofender: no they won't
[12:21] <cge> pipak_: What do you mean by stop?
[12:21] <lupine_85> mind you, I never was much of a C wizard
[12:21] <leofender> at least I make my own getch();
[12:21] <noldon> or xearth
[12:21] <cge> pipak_: Does it exit, or freeze?
[12:21] <lupine_85> leofender: you could use C++ :p
[12:21] <leofender> and I don't want to
[12:21] <Halpo> is it just libraries for the setting up the graphics and such?
[12:21] <pipak_> cge: by stop I mean it doesn't fetch anything, just exits
[12:21] <leofender> haha
[12:21] <leofender> no
[12:21] <lupine_85> cin and cout are your friends
[12:21] <savvas> Halpo: i'm not an expert, but i know desktops differ in libraries and window managers
[12:22] <cge> pipak_: There is nothing in /target?
[12:22] <leofender> I don't know object oriented programming
[12:22] <lupine_85> you don't have to
[12:22] <leofender> I'll learn it next year
[12:22] <MenZa> Could anyone tell me how I change the language of X? I installed the language I wish to change to.
[12:22] <pipak_> cge: I removed everything, yes
[12:22] <nashnash> someone knows a scanning program besides xsane and kooka ?
[12:22] <lupine_85> C++ is C with some optional bells and whistles
[12:22] <Halpo> so desktop environments, window managers, programs are not necessarily modular
[12:22] <LjL> leofender: have a look at here http://www.ozzu.com/ftopic32782.html    there appears to be a conio -> ncurses wrapper (lupine_85 too, FYI)
[12:22] <lupine_85> Mind you, C++ Builder for Windows runs under wine
[12:22] <cge> pipak_: Are you sure it didn't actually install everything? Debootstrap only installs the absolute minimum.
[12:23] <leofender> ahh
[12:23] <leofender> wine
[12:23] <leofender> you're right
[12:23] <lupine_85> version 3 here
[12:23] <leofender> hey
[12:23] <LjL> leofender: though it gives me a 404. but search for "linux-conio-1.02.tgz" on google, finds a few
[12:23] <LjL> leofender: or search for "linux-conio" even
[12:23] <pipak_> cge: yes but not enough to chroot into it I think :(
[12:23] <leofender> what language do I have to know in order to program graphical aplications for linux?
[12:23] <leofender> using xlib
[12:23] <leofender> C?
[12:23] <lupine_85> any, really
[12:23] <leofender> or C++?
[12:23] <cge> pipak_: So if you run it, and then try to chroot into it, what happens?
[12:23] <LjL> leofender: either.
[12:24] <lupine_85> there are bindings for all the major (and even some minor) languages
[12:24] <lupine_85> even Pascal :p
[12:24] <Landon> nashnash: After I go to shared folders, I still can not see any other window's PC's
[12:24] <macphil> ah i give evms a try and it seems there is a chance to get my data back
[12:24] <savvas> python.. hsss
[12:24] <leofender> wich one?
[12:24] <lupine_85> Ubuntu preferred language is python though, for some unknown reason
[12:24] <LjL> lupine_85: god forbid
[12:24] <Pupeno> what was the command to pick the alternatives in /etc/alternatives ?
[12:24] <lupine_85> I know... use object pascal instead :p
[12:24] <pipak_> cge: no /bin/bash, there's only debootstrap, dev, etc and var directories that have been created
[12:24] <MenZa> Could anyone tell me how I change the language of X? I installed the language I wish to change to. Noone?
[12:24] <earthian> can somebody compile wine on 64bit ubuntu and add it to the universe repositories?
[12:24] <baconbacon> lupine_85: Shuttleworth built his company on python (thawte)
[12:24] <cge> pipak_: Oh!
[12:24] <lupine_85> baconbacon: don't mean it's great though :p
[12:24] <cge> pipak_: Could you dump the output to a webpage or to #flood?
[12:24] <nashnash> Landon u're not supposed to see ur network there, u need to set there on "General properties" Your network name
[12:24] <savvas> lupine_85: it's not strange, it's because it's more user-oriented than only object-oriented :P
[12:24] <LjL> earthian: not the right place i think. you could possibly ask on the MOTU channel
[12:25] <wimpies> How can I listen to streamed media on amazon.com ? amarok does not seem to do it ...
[12:25] <lupine_85> bill gates build his empire on... wait for it... basic
[12:25] <nashnash> and after u set ur network name there u can go to Places ---> network servers
[12:25] <baconbacon> lupine_85: it was an obvious choice for him i guess
[12:25] <leofender> so I cannot program with xlib in C
[12:25] <lupine_85> leofender: you can
[12:25] <LjL> leofender: YES you can
[12:25] <leofender> how?
[12:25] <lupine_85> you can program with xlib in any language at all
[12:25] <LjL> leofender: by doing it?
[12:25] <leofender> haha
[12:25] <leofender> yeah
[12:25] <LjL> leofender: just about every program for Gnome is written in C
[12:25] <leofender> I need to learn from a tutorial
[12:25] <LjL> (and most others, as well)
[12:25] <lupine_85> it's a bit complicated to explain all the functions to you, though
[12:25] <pipak_> cge: the output of debootstrap? yes I can copy it to #flood
[12:25] <delight> cge variant : i think the best solution for ppl not beeing happy with the hidden-root thingy is to just: sudo su - ; cd / ; mv .hidden .hidden-root ; touch .hidden ... because of restoring the file when updating  kubuntu-desktop-setting ... this way you rename the link and can still have it ... for the case u like to re-enable
[12:25] <leofender> and for KDE?
[12:25] <moolcool_> i installed xbuntu and kbuntu on top of my original ubuntu, can i delete it?
[12:25] <cge> pipak_: Yes.
[12:25] <lupine_85> you call XCreateWindow and go from there, IIRC
[12:26] <cge> delight: It restores the file!?
[12:26] <LjL> leofender: perhaps http://tronche.com/gui/x/
[12:26] <lupine_85> KDE is usually done in C++ (i.e. the Qt interface)
[12:26] <cge> delight: That should be a bug.
[12:26] <leofender> ok
[12:26] <leofender> thanks
[12:26] <kgklrcia> yo yo yo
[12:26] <lupine_85> just hack around and have fun :)
[12:26] <mo79> Hi, can someone help me out on installing a Canon iP1500 printer (on Dapper?) I've been trying to follow this page, but the command 'sudo alien -k bjfil*i386.rpm' leads to 'File "bjfil*i386.rpm" not found.'
[12:26] <dou213> moolcool_, yes, sudo apt-get remove kubuntu
[12:26] <mo79> http://www.macewan.org/2006/08/23/canon-ip1500-on-ubuntu-linux/
[12:26] <savvas> moolcool_: i think so, reinstalling the ubuntu-desktop package?
[12:27] <delight> cge : no the /.hidden is a sym-link ... and if you edit it it might get restored on update of  kubuntu-desktop-setting
[12:27] <leofender> thank you guys
[12:27] <mcphail> leofender: buy a copy of "beginning linux programming"

[12:30] <abo> LjL, I already installed automatix... it didn't fix that
[12:31] <ProtonBart> all i did was disable my WPA
[12:31] <LjL> abo: which does not surprise me in the least.
[12:31] <cge> pipak_: One minute.
[12:31] <LjL> !automatix
[12:31] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[12:31] <abo> ok... I tried removing realplayer and reinstalling it using synaptic and yet it doesn't work
[12:31] <savvas> abo: try installing the w32codecs it has in its lists
[12:31] <moolcool_> i did the sudo apt-get remove kbuntu and it said package not fond
[12:31] <delight> cge one last thing its kubuntu-default-settings not kubuntu-desktop-settings ! my mistake
[12:32] <vidd> LjL ty for booting the cuss master
[12:32] <abo> savvas, the codecs do work properly, I can play wmv files and other video/audio files, it's only the firefox plugins that are not working
[12:32] <Landon> nashnash: Sorry, last question, under host description it says Server(samba,ubuntu), but isn't the host windows?
[12:32] <moolcool_> i did the sudo apt-get remove kbuntu and it said package not fond
[12:33] <Landon> nashnash: For domain/workgroup I put in my networks name
[12:33] <nashnash> why the host need to be windows? u r using ubuntu arent u? :p
[12:33] <pipak_> cge: sure :)
[12:33] <ukubuntu> That is an interesting automatix text, I saw on the Planet about automatix being more integrated in Feisty, I will get a link
[12:33] <nashnash> yes put there ur network name
[12:33] <Landon> Yeah, but the router is set up on a windows PC
[12:33] <dou213> moolcool_, because the package name is kubuntu
[12:33] <LjL> ukubuntu: integrated? sure.
[12:33] <ProtonBart> god isnt ubuntu just the best OS ever
[12:33] <ryanakca> LjL: heh, even with 0 in it, it's much much faster...
[12:33] <nashnash> Landon, it doesnt matter
[12:33] <nashnash> i use router too
[12:33] <cge> pipak_: Ok, I'm back.
[12:33] <ProtonBart> :)

[12:34] <Landon> nashnash: Okay, I put in the router name, host is the same, but I still can't see the window's PC files
[12:34] <ubotu> Package samba-client does not exist in edgy
[12:34] <baconbacon> !info smbclient edgy

[12:34] <ukubuntu> http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/10/30/automatix-and-upgrading
[12:34] <savvas> abo: did you try installing packages totem-mozilla or mozilla-plugin-vlc ?
[12:34] <nashnash> Landon
[12:34] <cge> pipak_: You could try using the main ubuntu.com server.
[12:34] <nashnash> you checked on Places --> Network servers/
[12:34] <cge> pipak_: It is possible that the mirrors don't have the right files.
[12:34] <nashnash> ?
[12:35] <moolcool_> i tried sudo apt-get remove kubuntu this time and it still said package not fond
[12:35] <LjL> ryanakca: trying 0 as well, just for curiosity... though i'll turn off the computer during the night, and i don't do much background stuff at all, so i'm not sure i'll see a difference
[12:35] <fatlip> how do i get shift-backspace to stop killing my x session again?
[12:35] <Landon> nashnash: There it is!
[12:35] <Landon> nashnash: Thanks a lot!
[12:35] <abo> savvas, I have totem-mozilla installed
[12:35] <abo> savvas, should I try reinstalling it?
[12:36] <n1gke> Good night folks time for some zzz's.
[12:36] <baconbacon> Landon: fyi, you dont have to install anything to get to windows (smb) shares, on ubuntu
[12:36] <pipak_> cge: I've just tried removing everything in /target and use http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, it doesn't change a thing :(
[12:36] <Pockets> baconbacon: But Komba helps.
[12:36] <LjL> fatlip: don't use xgl ;-)  seriously, go to #ubuntu-xgl for xgl help
[12:36] <ryanakca> LjL: or not... It's fast when you come back to it, but then, it slows down as you open stuff..
[12:36] <Kuberr> can you install java 5.0 on on amd64 for firefox?
[12:36] <ryanakca> LjL: I'll try setting it to ~30
[12:36] <nashnash> Landon np ;)
[12:36] <LjL> ryanakca: yeah, because it'll have less stuff cached, so libraries etc will be loaded from disk every time. you need to find a balance you like
[12:37] <cge> pipak_: Ok
[12:37] <fatlip> well i know its a simple command like modmap or something ijust forgot it.. didnt know it was xgl-specific ;)
[12:37] <Kuberr> jre-1_5_0_09-linux-i586.bin
[12:37] <moolcool_> i tried sudo apt-get remove kubuntu this time and it still said package not fond
[12:37] <LjL> ryanakca: after all, if people have been debating over this, there was probably a reason.  oh well no wait, this doesn't really mean anything ;)
[12:37] <cge> pipak_: I imagine that there is a verbose option, try running it with that enabled.
[12:37] <abo> savvas, I also have mozilla-plugin-vlc intalled
[12:37] <LjL> moolcool_: indeed, there is no such package. do you want to remove KDE?
[12:38] <ryanakca> variant: ok, I have a 1.68gb HD here, how do I make it that "super swap"? use QParted and partition it into two smaller swap spaces and then add something to my fstab?
[12:38] <moolcool_> yes!
[12:38] <moolcool_> and x
[12:38] <savvas> abo: close firefox, reinstall it and try again. if it doesn't work, close firefox, try the same procedure with the vlc plugin
[12:38] <LjL> moolcool_: the package name is kubuntu-desktop
[12:38] <moolcool_> oooh
[12:38] <moolcool_> ok
[12:38] <samuel> where can i find the md5sum of edgy for 64bit machines?
[12:38] <moolcool_> ill try that
[12:38] <pipak_> cge: with --verbose option, there's nothing more
[12:38] <Kuberr> is it possible to install java 5.0 on an amd64 for firefox?
[12:38] <savvas> abo: if that doesn't work, well.. dunno what else to suggest :\
[12:38] <Pockets> moolcool: No X at all?
[12:38] <abo> ok savvas, I'll do now and let you know
=== user-land2 is now known as user-land
[12:38] <GIFRATE> I have a USB headset, How do I set it to be the default sound device?
[12:38] <LjL> moolcool_: for X, it's xserver-xorg, but i'm not sure removing it will really remove much of X at all, unless you installed from the server CD
[12:38] <ryanakca> moolcool_: sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop won't uninstall the kubuntu apps
[12:38] <cge> moolcool_: That will only work if you are running edgy and did not upgrade from dapper.
[12:39] <deepskies> test
[12:39] <cge> ryanakca: It will if you have an edgy install and use apt-get autoremove
[12:39] <LjL> ryanakca: no, but if it's edgy and he installed it in edgy, he'll be able to "apt-get autoremove" to remove them, i think
[12:39] <LjL> cge: exactly
[12:39] <moolcool_> i dont want to want to remove the apps
[12:39] <ryanakca> ah, never knew about that one :)
[12:39] <cge> pipak_: There isn't? Oh dear.
[12:39] <LjL> moolcool_: then what on earth do you want to remove?
[12:39] <cge> ryanakca: For some reason, it isn't in the apt man page. In fact, now that I think of it, I need to file a bug about that.
[12:39] <moolcool_> because it is taking up my hdd and i dont like kde
[12:40] <LjL> moolcool_: you realize that removing X will make all your graphical applications unusable, don't you? (well, they'll be uninstalled actually)
[12:40] <cge> pipak_: Hmm...
[12:40] <LjL> moolcool_: KDE is made of applications.
[12:40] <moolcool_> i dont mean removing x i mean xubuntu
[12:40] <LjL> moolcool_: that's quite a different thing...
[12:40] <Pockets> er
[12:40] <moolcool_> i see
[12:40] <LjL> moolcool_: the package is xubuntu-desktop
[12:40] <cge> pipak_: I'm not sure then. Are you running out of space in /target, perhaps? I suppose you could also try using strace to see if something is going wrong.
[12:41] <ProtonBart> im new to ubuntu what should i do now, that i got everythign i need working
[12:41] <cge> pipak_: Or there is something wrong with debootstrap. I'm trying it right now.
[12:41] <Pockets> ProtonBart: Find more stuff that doesn't work, and repeat the process all over again.
[12:41] <LjL> moolcool_: but again, removing kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop will remove all the kubuntu-specific and xubuntu-specific applications respectively.
[12:41] <ProtonBart> any manuals for control and learning to install and configure stuff
[12:41] <ProtonBart> ?
[12:41] <Pockets> ProtonBart: That's the whole point in using Linux.
[12:41] <ProtonBart> IM if possible
[12:41] <moolcool_> got cha
[12:41] <moolcool_> thx

[12:42] <LjL> noldon: the main window that takes all of your desktop and is the parent of all your other windows

[12:42] <cge> pipak_: Oh, you are using the *debian* floppy installer?
[12:43] <cge> pipak_: Maybe it doesn't have the edgy scripts for debootstrap installed?

[12:43] <cge> pipak_: What is in /usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts?
[12:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Landon about mpe
[12:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mpe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Landon about mp3
[12:43] <pipak_> cge: it's located in /usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts
[12:43] <vidd> landon: did you install win32codecs?
[12:44] <Landon> Not that I know of vidd
[12:44] <cge> pipak_: So you do have edgy in there?
[12:44] <vidd> landon that should be the first thing to tr
[12:44] <Landon> vidd: Where would I install that?
[12:44] <LjL> vidd: mp3 has nothing to do with win32codecs
[12:44] <LjL> !mp3

[12:44] <vidd> landon: fire up synaptic
[12:45] <Landon> vidd: Fired up
[12:45] <pipak_> cge: yes, there's edgy and I tried others than edgy, some of them get different output than edgy script but they don't install either
[12:45] <jvai> how on earth d oi use this alacarte thingy.. i wanted to remove firestarter from the internet section, but it removed it from admin also!, soo, i had to show for every place, the same w/ nmapfe
[12:45] <|Jackal|> help?  black screen after installing fglrx on edgy.  radeon 8500 (worked fine w/ dapper)  copying over the original xorg.conf of course fixes it.
[12:45] <LjL> Landon: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-1340337f2ca1d0c54900935468515ba7630fcc59   specifically
[12:45] <cge> pipak_: I'd guess it is a problem with the floppy then.
[12:45] <vidd> landon: LjL says win32codecs will not help
[12:45] <cge> pipak_: What version of debootstrap is on it?
[12:45] <Landon> Oh
[12:46] <j0sh-> Hey, is anyone familliar with upgrading from Dapper Drake, to Edgy? somehow my machine lost power during the upgrade using the method on the website, Afterwords, i had alot of errors, but got it to finish upgrading, When i rebooted the machine, the new startup screen was shown, but afterwords their were errors with xorg, when i closed that, their was no way to get a terminal, i couldnt even switch tty's
[12:46] <pipak_> cge: 0.3.3.0ubuntu7
[12:46] <cge> pipak_: So this is an ubuntu floppy?
[12:46] <vidd> Landon what app you have installed to play mp3's?
[12:46] <Landon> vidd: Noatun, Kaffeine, and JUK
[12:46] <GIFRATE> where can I change my default sound device? anyone?
[12:46] <Amaranth> jvai: That's a bug in the version of alacarte that was in Ubuntu 6.06. It's fixed in 6.10
[12:46] <music_man_nz> Hi. How can I set ubuntu to run the command line: "su /opt/lampp/lampp start" on start up?
[12:46] <LjL> vidd, can't we just try to follow the official howto before finding patches to problems that might not exist? ;-)
[12:47] <pipak_> cge: debootstrap has some ubuntu scripts included I think
[12:47] <Landon> LjL, I like that idea :-P
[12:47] <jvai> snap.. ty so much amaranth
[12:47] <LjL> music_man_nz: why "su"?
[12:47] <music_man_nz> because you need to run it as root
[12:47] <pipak_> cge: but the floppy itself is from debian
[12:47] <NemesisUK> GIFRATE, system>preferences>sound
[12:48] <maxflax> Is OSS built in the kernel as alsa is.. and is it used by Ubuntu by default?
[12:48] <ryanakca> lol
[12:48] <LjL> Landon: so try that. the howto hasn't been updated for Edgy yet, but installing gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly should still work i think
[12:48] <mcphail> music_man_nz: add it to root's crontab
[12:48] <music_man_nz> um
[12:48] <abo> savvas, it didn't work, but while playing around, I change the player to mplayer, and got this error: Video codec 'MS WMV 9 (win32)' is not handled. You might need to install additional plugins to be able to play some types of movies, I checked apt-get install w32codecs, it said it's at the newest version
[12:48] <music_man_nz> how can I do that?
[12:48] <cge> pipak_: Hmm... it works for me
[12:48] <LjL> vidd: actually, i don't even know how it's done in Gnome, since i use KDE, it's just that trying the official documentation before anything else is normally a good idea
[12:48] <Landon> LjL, thanks, I'll try it
[12:48] <cge> pipak_: You could try using an Ubuntu LiveCD with debootstrap, which is what I did to install edgy.
[12:48] <mcphail> music_man_nz: sudo crontab -e -u root
[12:49] <music_man_nz> thanks. i'll try it out
[12:49] <cge> LjL: I can confirm that installing that will work.
[12:49] <LjL> Landon: of course, if you have Rythmbox open, you need to close it completely and restart it, for MP3 support to start working
[12:49] <LjL> Landon, see cge too
[12:49] <mcphail> music_man_nz: in the editor which appears type: @reboot /opt/lampp/lampp start
[12:49] <ryanakca> LjL: any idea on creating that super swap? (variant was telling me about it back when you were helping me)... two small swap partitions, and then you add a line in /etc/fstab and it acts like some sort of RAID thing...
[12:49] <Landon> LjL: Where can I add/remove programs, I don't seem to have that option anymore
[12:49] <pipak_> cge: I wish it was that simple, it's a laptop and unfortunately the cdrom reader doesn't work anymore... and I can't boot from usb natively
[12:49] <music_man_nz> mcphail: on a new line?
[12:50] <cge> pipak_: Ah, you are trying something difficult :)
[12:50] <vidd> the official documentation (none for edgy of course) does not help me get my BCM43xx wireles card to work =[
[12:50] <mcphail> music_man_nz: yes, then save the file
[12:50] <pipak_> cge: I guess, but I don't have many options :(
[12:50] <vidd> Landon you have synaptic up
[12:50] <vidd> use that
[12:50] <savvas> abo: maybe it's a copyrighted wmv, which i don't think ubuntu supports
[12:50] <music_man_nz> mcphail: thank you very much for your help :)
[12:50] <Landon> vidd: Thanks
[12:50] <abo> savvas, the bbc news video are copyrighted?
[12:51] <pipak_> cge: is there some kind of official ubuntu boot floppy for installation?
[12:51] <troxor> would someone refresh my memory on how to get the default gnome desktop back? moving ~/.gnome2 wasn't sufficient
[12:51] <vidd> can someone help me with that?
[12:51] <abo> savvas, can you try to play them yourself and let me know plz?
[12:51] <music_man_nz> how do I save lol
[12:51] <cge> pipak_: No, Ubuntu doesn't officially support debootstrap installations if I recall correctly.
[12:51] <cge> pipak_: But let me look at something else.
[12:52] <music_man_nz> got it
[12:52] <music_man_nz> seeya
[12:52] <savvas> abo: give me the link, i can try :)
[12:52] <ramvi> When I'm "in" Xgl, it uses the gnome-icons instead of the Human / ubuntu icons.. How do I correct this?
[12:52] <earthian> cge: debootstrap installation from normal does not differ
[12:52] <Geoffrey2> vidd, these instructions worked for me in getting broadcom up and running... http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174&highlight=broadcom
[12:53] <cge> earthian: Err, what do you mean by that?
[12:53] <abo> http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/help/3681938.stm
[12:53] <vidd> Geoffrey2  at this point i will try anything
[12:53] <sebastes> Can anybody recommend an iso mounting script for nautilus?
[12:53] <cge> pipak_: Hmm... I really don't know.
[12:54] <abo> savvas, best would be to go to http://news.bbc.co.uk/ and select any video
[12:54] <satempler> are the dri modules for ati installed in edgy by default
[12:54] <earthian> i mean that when you install using the base systam (debootstraping) and ubuntu-base ubuntu-desktop you get ubuntu installation that you get by regular setup. u get same packages
[12:54] <vidd> Geoffrey2 did you do this for edgy?
[12:54] <abo> savvas, any video in video news
[12:54] <cge> pipak_: You might try asking on the mailing list.
[12:54] <LjL> ryanakca: yes, ive done that in the past, though i don't have that kind of setup now
[12:54] <pipak_> cge: allright, thanks for your help :)
[12:54] <amias> hi all
[12:54] <cge> earthian: The same packages, yes. But not the same /etc/fstab, and so on.
[12:54] <LjL> ryanakca: basically you just need to give the two partitions the same priority
[12:54] <cge> pipak_: You could also try...
[12:54] <earthian> ah
[12:54] <earthian> :)
[12:54] <earthian> you can always make fstab yourself
[12:54] <earthian> :)
[12:54] <sebastes> satempler: The DRI module seems to be having issues with the fglrx driver
[12:54] <B_166-ER-X> ok, i just installed edgy (harder than expected..)   but , i have no idea why, i have no sound at all (it was working as always on dapper before )     any idea?
[12:55] <LjL> Landon: it should be under Applications -- though that's a stripped-down version. in System / Administration / Synaptic (I think) you'll have the full thing
[12:55] <CactusSediento> Hello everybody.....i just finished doing the edgy upgrade and x does not run >>
[12:55] <LjL> Landon: but you can also just use "sudo apt-get install <packagename>" from a terminal
[12:55] <amias> there don't seem to be any  devices nodes in my initrd which is breaking bootup after an upgrade to edgy  , anyone know how to fix this ?
[12:55] <cge> pipak_: ... unpacking debootstrap from ubuntu onto a USB disk, then booting with a floppy distribution like tomsrbt and using that.
[12:55] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: what does alsamixer -c 0 do?
[12:55] <satempler> sebastes: I have a card that can use it or fglrx
[12:55] <satempler> i want to use it for fglrx
[12:55] <savvas> abo: sorry, doesn't work on mine :p i don't think i have any plugins installed though and i really won't because i don't use them a lot
[12:55] <Geoffrey2> vidd, no, I did this under dapper...the instructions say it SHOULD work under Edgy as well
[12:55] <Landon> LjL: Yeah, that's what I'll use. I'm trying to convert my music to Vorbis
[12:55] <Pockets> satempler: Can't get direct rendering working?
[12:56] <abo> savvas, ok thanks anyway
[12:56] <LjL> ryanakca: http://unthought.net/Software-RAID.HOWTO/Software-RAID.HOWTO-2.html
[12:56] <vidd> Geoffrey2 oh...my card worked fine in dapper, it dont work in edgy
[12:56] <Pockets> vidd: fglrx?
[12:56] <abo> savvas, just to note, it used to work on dapper before I upgraded to edgy
[12:56] <maxflax> Whats the diffrence between OSS and Alsa.. and is OSS installed in ubuntu or is that only the Alsa emulation of OSS?
[12:56] <vidd> Pockets ????
[12:56] <Geoffrey2> vidd, well, keep in mind you'd need to reinstall the firmware, since that doesn't ship with Ubuntu
[12:56] <Landon> LjL: Is there a way to play MP3's without converting them?
[12:56] <cge> maxflax: OSS is really old, ALSA is new and much better.
[12:57] <sebastes> satempler: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934&highlight=fglrx+dri this seemed like it might be a solution
[12:57] <satempler> Pockets: want to try AIGLX
[12:57] <Landon> LjL: Converting worked, just don't want to convert ALL my must to Vorbis
[12:57] <pipak_> cge: I'll see what I can do :) Thanks again!
[12:57] <Landon> *music
[12:57] <NemesisUK> satempler, you cant use fglrx and aiglx
[12:57] <cge> pipak_: Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
[12:57] <vidd> Geoffrey2 i know that....i had to wipe my system clean cuzz the updater (i KNOW ITS BROKE NOW) trashed my system
[12:57] <LjL> ryanakca: the procedure (roughly) is 1) create a swap partition on the other drive, using gparted or cfdisk or whatever  2) use mkfs -t swap /dev/partition  to make the filesystem (gparted may do that for you i think)   3) add the entry in /etc/fstab, and give it the same priority as the other partition   4) reboot, or "sudo swapon -a"
[12:58] <vidd> So im working with a clean install
[12:58] <satempler> NemesisUK: thats why I want to use the ati driver
[12:58] <LjL> Landon: that wasn't what i was suggesting, at all. converting MP3 to Vorbis loses quality (though Vorbis itself is fine, it's just the conversion from MP3)
[12:58] <rummik> how do i skip a package?
[12:58] <vidd> and that was the guide i truied to use
[12:58] <NemesisUK> satempler, what card you got
[12:58] <B_166-ER-X> !paste
[12:58] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:58] <SB|nblracer> stupid question how do you change drives
[12:58] <maxflax> cge, old isn't bad.. old is good if they still develop it..
[12:58] <LjL> Landon: scroll *down* some more on that page, where it says " Install the package gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly."
[12:58] <SB|nblracer> like go into a diffeent hdd in console
[12:59] <Landon> LjL: Okay
[12:59] <DShepherd> SB|nblracer: stupid answer.. you dont
[12:59] <vidd> this is what i get when i lsmod |grep -i bcm:
[12:59] <cge> maxflax: I don't think it is developed any more. ALSA has many advantages.
[12:59] <satempler> NemesisUK: Radeon X200 I want to know if the dri modules are included in the kernel
[12:59] <maxflax> cge, I think I saw somewhere that OSS have 2 variants.. one that is free and one that costs money.. :/
[12:59] <SB|nblracer> so how do i save a file into hdc1
[12:59] <LjL> Landon: then just use your Rythmbox to listen to your MP3.
[12:59] <NemesisUK> satempler, yes
[12:59] <satempler> they do
[12:59] <mjr> satempler, if that's express 200, no DRI with that
[12:59] <LjL> SB|nblracer: first you need to mount it
[12:59] <satempler> ok
[12:59] <Landon> LjL: Well, let's give this one a try
[12:59] <LjL> !mount | SB|nblracer
[12:59] <ubotu> SB|nblracer: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[12:59] <SB|nblracer> LjL it is mounted
[12:59] <maxflax> cge, http://www.4front-tech.com/
[01:00] <satempler> OH ok that explains things
[01:00] <B_166-ER-X> troxor sorry, was looking fora way to showyou the screenshot wel... the command does what it supposed to i guess, but i dont know  what to look for
[01:00] <LjL> SB|nblracer: well then the problem is?
[01:00] <SB|nblracer> LjL from console how do i switch in to that drive
[01:00] <rummik> i'm in the middle of a dist upgrade, and flash is gumming up the works (how'd it get here, i don't know, but it's not getting past the "downloading" part that it likes to do when it installs the player...)
[01:00] <SB|nblracer> like in windows it is X:/
[01:00] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: just whatever card it's using by default... so long as a mic or webcam didn't take the first audio slot

[01:02] <B_166-ER-X> troxor i still dont have sound and not more advanced on my problem :/
[01:02] <maxflax> cge, found a guide how to install OSS on ubuntu.. intresting.. maybe new OSS drivers can fix my sound problem
[01:02] <cge> maxflax: No, I doubt it.
[01:03] <LjL> SB|nblracer: "cd" in general is the command that lets you move around directories. and since mounted drives, in Linux, are simply treated as directories...
[01:03] <vidd> anyone have ideas?
[01:03] <crimsun> maxflax: HDA development isn't done on i810_audio
[01:03] <LjL> maxflax, OSS has been deprecated from the Linux kernel since a few years
[01:03] <geekchic9-1> What are is the hard drive requirement for Ubuntu 6.10? I want to install it on a laptop with a very small (3 GB) hard drive.
[01:03] <swaby1> I had trouble with sound with my onboard sound and replaced with a soundblaster sound and it worked
[01:03] <noone> hi I just installed ubuntu and my right <Alt> key is not working, this is a problem seeing as I am left handed. Anyone know how to correct this?
[01:03] <dooglus> geekchic9-1: 3GB is enough
[01:03] <LjL> geekchic9-1: 3Gb should do, but tight.
[01:04] <cge> geekchic9-1: What exactly do you want to install?
[01:04] <mcphail> geekchic9-1: you will need more than 3GB
[01:04] <geekchic9-1> thanks
[01:04] <geekchic9-1> more?
[01:04] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: what card is listed in alsamixer?
[01:04] <B_166-ER-X> !sound
[01:04] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure alsa is selected by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (Alsa Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, then look at http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems
[01:04] <cge> geekchic9-1: Apparently, everyone has a different opinion...
[01:04] <LjL> geekchic9-1: 3Gb will be enough for the base install, but you won't have much space left
[01:04] <SB|nblracer> LjL one more question right now that drive is owned by root, should i change it to my username so, i dont have to move files using sudo through console
[01:04] <mcphail> geekchic9-1: you might get away with it if you don't use any swap space
[01:04] <SB|nblracer> this why i can use the gui?
[01:04] <B_166-ER-X> troxor i dont see that anywhere
[01:04] <dooglus> mcphail: even using 1GB for swap it's still enough
[01:04] <geekchic9-1> ugh, it will be very slow, mcphail
[01:05] <dooglus> mcphail: how big do you think ubuntu's base install is?  hint: it fits on 1 CD
[01:05] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: did you do that which !sound mentioned?
[01:05] <rummik> anyone know how to skip/restart the install of a package, without screwing with the rest of the packages?
[01:05] <amias> whats the current kernel version in edgy ?
[01:05] <mcphail> dooglus: i tried to install one on a 3 gig virtual machine. the install failed near the end with "insufficient space" or something
[01:05] <ryanakca> do you need to turn off a system to plug in a HD? (I'm guessing Yes, but, I've been wrong before)
[01:06] <livingtm_> 2.6.17
[01:06] <B_166-ER-X> troxor, yup .. and i changed the default to my SBlive! soundcard
[01:06] <watson540> hrm it seems ubuntus kernel doesnt like fbset
[01:06] <B_166-ER-X> still no sound
[01:06] <NemesisUK> ryanakca, if its internal yes
[01:06] <amias> livingtm_, thnx
[01:06] <crimsun> amias: 2.6.17.13 + patches
[01:06] <mcphail> dooglus: remember that .debs are compressed
[01:06] <swaby1> how do you get a wireless card to work in a laptop with ubuntu
[01:06] <dooglus> mcphail: I know, but not that much.
[01:06] <maxflax> crimsun, ok.. thouht I saw my driver on their list on their homepage.
[01:06] <noone> is this the ubuntu support room??
[01:06] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: volume levels, speakers plugged  in, etc? ;)
[01:06] <geekchic9-1> I guess the best way to find out is to install it. Thanks anyway, everyone.
[01:07] <cge> geekchic9-1: If it won't work, you can always try xubuntu

[01:07] <B_166-ER-X> troxor yup, and i was working in dapper a few hours ago..
[01:07] <|Jackal|> help?  after installing fglrx on edgy, the new xorg.conf file causes it to come up to a black screen.  (i can hear an error type bell at this point)  used to work fine in dapper.. any ideas?
[01:07] <vidd> has anyone successfully installed a bcm43xx driver/firmware in edgy?
[01:07] <rummik> swaby1, if it doesn't just work, you might want to try installing ndiswrapper
[01:07] <LjL> SB|nblracer: don't know if that's doable through the Gnome GUI mounter, as well
[01:07] <geekchic9-1> cge: True, but I'd really like it to use Ubuntu so everyone in the office uses the same thing.
[01:07] <swaby1> where can I get ndiswrapper?
[01:08] <noone> hi I just installed ubuntu and my right <Alt> key is not working, this is a problem seeing as I am left handed. Anyone know how to correct this?
[01:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell swaby1 about ndiswrapper
[01:08] <Seb> are w32codecs not in ubuntu at all ?
[01:08] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: have you played with the switches in the volume control?
[01:08] <B_166-ER-X> troxor http://paste.ubuntu.org.cn/1051
[01:08] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: sometimes there's a digital out thing
[01:08] <dkr> oh, that's why my theme looked lame.  the upgrade removed some of the themes my custom theme had chosen parts from
[01:09] <B_166-ER-X> nope, i didnt touch anything ( i think)
[01:09] <rummik> LjL, i think ubotu is case sensitive ;)
[01:09] <kevb> anyone know why I'm having problems with sluggish flash on edgy??
[01:09] <vidd> kevb which version of flash?
[01:09] <NemesisUK> kevb, what version of flash
[01:09] <kevb> 9
[01:09] <dkr> 9beta, you mean, :)
[01:09] <noone> does anybodys right <Alt> key work?
[01:10] <kevb> yeah
[01:10] <vidd> kevb plugin or standalone?
[01:10] <kevb> plugin, firefox 2
[01:10] <troxor> B_166-ER-X: it looks like your default card is the SiS one (probably onboard)..  in sound preferences, is everything set to autodetect, or to your sblive?
[01:10] <dfr> hey, guys, has anyone played with xgl a bunch?
[01:10] <LjL> rummik: hehe, nope ;)
[01:10] <kevb> using nvidia drivers if that matters
[01:10] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: asoundconf set-default-card Live
[01:10] <dfr> I dont seem to be able to make it run xorg on the display 93 =/
[01:10] <noone> zzz
[01:10] <vidd> noone   i never noticed b4....mine dont work either
[01:11] <noone> wtf??
[01:11] <rummik> LjL, oh yeah, i forgot that ubotu pm's the user...
[01:11] <rummik> it's been a while since i've been here, you'll have to forgive me ;)
[01:11] <B_166-ER-X> sound preference ? troxor ?
[01:11] <dooglus> kevb: flash is designed for Windows primarity.  the Linux player is crappy.
[01:11] <vidd> noone....did you try to configure your keyboard?
[01:11] <reiki> if I have Dapper installed on sda1 and Edgy was installed separately to hda1, can I take the grub menu.list items from the one on the Edgy install, paste them into the menu.list on the Dapper install and therefore be able to boot to either one without messig with my bios boot order?
[01:11] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: just execute the command I gave you
[01:11] <B_166-ER-X> in 'sound' i have everything autodetect
[01:12] <BlueEagle> noone: my Alt Gr key works fine.
[01:12] <B_166-ER-X> crimsun dit
[01:12] <B_166-ER-X> i did
[01:12] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: now pastebin ``amixer''
[01:12] <noone> vidd: yea thru gnome-control-center
[01:12] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: since you forgot to paste that last time
[01:12] <kevb> dooglus: this i know, however performance has decreased in 9 for me, I'm wondering if I am alone or not
[01:12] <Zyfo> When I've got autohide on a panel I need to hold the mouse over it for a while until it shows. How can I decrease the time needed to show the panel?
[01:12] <vidd> noone were you able to keymap anything to it?
[01:12] <Geoffrey2> I installed Firefox 2 using the automated install script...everything seems to be working fine, but I can't make it locate Flash 7 from the repos....
[01:12] <noone> BlueEagle: what is Alt Gr?
[01:12] <kevb> perhaps it is not even a flash issue i am suffering
[01:12] <NemesisUK> dooglus, the linux player isnt crappy works fine on the machines Ive built
[01:12] <reiki> ack... back in a sec
[01:13] <B_166-ER-X> http://paste.ubuntu.org.cn/1052 crimsun
[01:13] <BlueEagle> noone: That is the key directly to the left of my space key. Before the Super (Win) key, the win-menu key and the right ctrl key.
[01:13] <gouki> Geoffrey2 - I'm not sure you'll find Flash on the repositories. Download it from Macromedia site and install (simple script)
[01:14] <noone> BlueEagle: does the <Alt> key on the right of space key work?
[01:14] <gouki> Geoffrey2 - You can even go for the 9 BETA. I've heard it's pretty stable.
[01:14] <Geoffrey2> gouki, Flash 7 is in the repositories, flash 9 isn't, but that's very much a work in progress, and rather buggy
[01:14] <BlueEagle> noone: Yes, it works as it is intended to do on my keyboard layout (no-latin1)
[01:14] <RMorris84> i have 2 questions: one on my grub menu i have two kernels and at startup it boots the one i dont want, i want it to boot up the other one how do i do that? and second, what is a good bittorent program for ubuntu besides azeurus ?
[01:14] <noone> BlueEagle: ahh, I am us 105
[01:15] <jdsbluedevl> hi, I'm having trouble upgrading my version of qmake.  I can't install this program called cb2Bib until I do so
[01:15] <Geoffrey2> gouki, I had flash 9 installed previously, had to remove it because it kept totally freezing up Firefox
[01:15] <BlueEagle> noone: That might be a good thing to include when you actually ask the original question. ;)
[01:15] <LjL> RMorris84, i think in Gnome you can just click on a bittorrent link, and a graphical client will start up.
[01:15] <kitche> RMorris84: you select the kernel that you want booted but you can remove the kernel from menu.lst for the one that don't want
[01:15] <LjL> RMorris84: as for changing the default kernel, look at the /boot/grub/menu.lst file
[01:15] <gouki> RMorris84 - I recommend rTorrent - Text-based client!
[01:16] <RMorris84> kitche: thanks...
[01:16] <vidd> RMorris84 change the default to the correct number
[01:16] <jdsbluedevl> does anyone know hot to upgrade the Qt packages?
[01:16] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: amixer set 'Sigmatel Surround' on && amixer set 'Sigmatel 4-Speaker Stereo' on && amixer set 'SB Live Analog/Digital Output Jack' on && amixer set 'Wave Center' 80% && amixer set 'Wave LFE' 80% && amixer set 'Wave Surround' 80%
[01:16] <RMorris84> as for the bittorrent, i need something that will keep my torrents up for seeding
[01:16] <jdsbluedevl> b/c it seems like I have, but it doesn't work
[01:16] <RMorris84> like on startup...
[01:16] <RMorris84> and something that keeps track of ratio for me
[01:16] <BlueEagle> noone: Oh, and do note that the two alt-keys aren't neccessarily set up to do the same thing. However there should be ways to remidy that. Google for alter keymap xorg or something
[01:16] <kevb> night all
[01:16] <samuel> where can i find the md5sum of edgy for 64bit machines?
[01:16] <gouki> RMorris84 - rTorrent
[01:16] <B_166-ER-X> crimsun , done
[01:17] <LjL> samuel, on the same page where you download it
[01:17] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: now play some music.
[01:17] <noone> BlueEagle: seems silly to have to do extra work to make an old keyboard work...   works fine in that other OS (winblows)
[01:17] <Keyseir> How do you uninstall software that was installed from source?
[01:17] <jaa6c6> hey does anyone know anything about setting up a raid5, i think i'm doing it right, i set up a raid 1 before but i can't get grub to install
[01:17] <str0ng> hello, can i install directly ubuntu.. without going into the live cd?
[01:17] <jdsbluedevl> if you installed it using checkinstall, sudo apt-get remove blah
[01:17] <troxor> Keyseir: good luck ;)
[01:17] <Werdna> hey, apt-get dist-upgrade reports serveral pacakges as "kept back". Why?
[01:17] <kitche> Keyseir: you still have the source?
[01:17] <LjL> Keyseir: go into the source directory, type "sudo make uninstall", and hope the programmer was kind.
[01:17] <jdsbluedevl> if you installed via makeinstall, a pain in the ass
[01:17] <crimsun> str0ng: use the alternate (text-based) installer
[01:18] <LjL> Keyseir: you could also use checkinstall for installing, next time
[01:18] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Keyseir about checkinstall
[01:18] <str0ng> crimsun, ah ok.. thanks :)
[01:18] <samuel> LjL, its not there, the page seems to have changed somewhat, now theres a new "friendly" css menu

[01:18] <Werdna> Landon: apt-get install avidemux
[01:18] <Keyseir> thx
[01:19] <reiki> I have Edgy on hda1 completely separate from Dapper on sda1. Neither has a reference to the other in their respective grub menu.list. Can I now just manually edit the menu.list on the Dapper install's grub menu so that I have the option to boot Edgy instead?
[01:19] <Landon> Werdna: Thanks, hopefully that'll work
[01:19] <LjL> Landon, others will be able to help you better, since i don't have any video codecs installed. the same page i gave you for MP3 has info about other formats, too -- read it
[01:19] <B_166-ER-X> crimsun, ok, i have sound with videos, but still no in XMMS :/  weird, its set to  SBlive!
[01:19] <jdsbluedevl> next time, if you install something from source, use checkinstall
[01:19] <Landon> LjL: thanks
[01:19] <jdsbluedevl> anyways, anyone know how to upgrade qt?
[01:19] <crimsun> B_166-ER-X: in xmms, use the alsa output plugin, and configure it to use the 'default' output device, not hw:1,0 or hw:0,0
[01:19] <B_166-ER-X> crimsun, its ok, it works, thankx a lot
[01:20] <LjL> jdsbluedevl: "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[01:20] <Landon> Werdna: Still doesn't work
[01:20] <fydo> ew xmms :P
[01:20] <jaa6c6> anyone know why grub might not install in a raid5 setup, also lilo will not, am I not installing it to the right place?
[01:20] <jdsbluedevl> I think it's pretty much up to date
[01:20] <jaa6c6> it locks up at 50% and errors out
[01:20] <jaa6c6> or fails
[01:21] <jdsbluedevl> I'm getting this error though: uic: File generated with too recent version of Qt Designer (4.0 vs. 3.3.6)

[01:21] <Werdna> ramvi: new nickserv password :-)
[01:21] <samuel> LjL, thanks!
[01:21] <ramvi> Right ;)
[01:21] <jdsbluedevl> what does that mean?
[01:21] <|Jackal|> lol
[01:21] <samuel> LjL, they removed it to make it more "user friendly"
[01:21] <edneymatias> hi all!
[01:21] <Werdna> who was that?
[01:21] <jdsbluedevl> if what I looked up was right, it means my qt compiler is too old
[01:22] <jdsbluedevl> but I have the qt4 stuff installed, I think
[01:22] <jdsbluedevl> although qmake -v shows the older version
[01:22] <LjL> samuel: hiding the md5sum doesn't seem too friendly to users to me, but anyway
[01:22] <troxor> jaa6c6: afaik, raid1 just duplicates one drive onto another... raid5 is a little more complicated
[01:23] <andy> anyone know why edgy upgrade causes excessive wireless packets?  wasn't the case w/ dapper..
[01:23] <jdsbluedevl> anyone have an idea?
[01:23] <jaa6c6> troxor: yea it seems to be working, it copys the files and installs but it fails on grub, maybe i can get help with the people taht work on grub
[01:24] <kitche> samuel: I think they removed it becuase they switched over to gpg from what I see from what I see
[01:25] <codecaine> hi I when I play a movie in mplayer there and go full screen the video is still small

[01:41] <jdsbluedevl> yup, that upgraded it
[01:41] <jdsbluedevl> now to check the make process
[01:41] <fydo> TRWBW: you don't need permission to ask questions
[01:41] <jdsbluedevl> yup, that did it
[01:41] <jdsbluedevl> thx
[01:41] <TRWBW> i haven't used linux in a few years, but i was wondering about user mode linux support
[01:42] <Davidou> where are the patches on kernel.org ?
[01:42] <TRWBW> or virtual machines under linux in general
[01:42] <earthian> TRWBW there is vmware free for linux
[01:42] <Maxflax> Davidou, why not compile the 2.6.18.1 kernel instead.. why waste time on 2.6.17
[01:43] <kitche> Davidou: also what's the name of the patch? since the changelog usually means the code is patched but the newest patch for 2.6.17 is from June
=== juliano is now known as [jb] 
[01:43] <TRWBW> yeah well vmware has a nice feature that it lets you define a virtual hard drive that is a differential off an existing one, the changes are stored separately from the original. i was wondering whether linux had that
[01:43] <Flosoft> hey
[01:43] <TRWBW> i mean i guess you could fake it with a loop device that saved changes, but didn't know if anyone had done that yes
[01:44] <Flosoft> how do I set the locale on my Ubuntu server?
[01:44] <Davidou> http://lwn.net/Articles/188861/  <-- I need these
[01:44] <Landon> Hey, how do I uninstall totem and re-install it?
[01:44] <Landon> As in, what is the commands for it?
[01:44] <Davidou> especially USB: Remove 4088-byte limit on usbfs control URBs
[01:44] <Davidou>       USB: Allow high-bandwidth isochronous packets via usbfs
[01:45] <Davidou> http://lists-archives.org/linux-usb-devel/10207-usb-allow-high-bandwidth-isochronous-packets-via-usbfs.html   <--- that's interesting
[01:45] <earthian> is there any option in the 2.6.18.1 kernel to make two sata hard drives usable as a RAID ?
[01:46] <Davidou> should I manually modify the specified files ?
[01:46] <TheOtherSB> has there been a recent (last 4 months) change to libc6 under Dapper that is forcing me to recompile all my libraries with -lm ?
[01:47] <Zyfo> I closed ffox and started it again, somehow I managed to not get up the "do you want to restore x windows?" popup, can I restore afterwards somehow? :p
[01:47] <Klohunt> Everytime I boot from the disk it opens the Ubuntu menu and when I hit install it just stalls and a message box opens with the title "I/O ERROR" and the contents: "Unable to boot from disk"
[01:48] <kitche> Zyfo: that isn't a feature of firefox but Opera has that feature
[01:48] <Klohunt> and a band of wierd colors appears at the top of my screen....
[01:48] <firebird6191082> I have been having trouble with Ubuntu starting. It goes through GRUB, but after that, the screen stays blank and I never get the login screen. What could be causing this?
[01:48] <fnf> Zyfo: Not likely, unless you chose to install an extension such as TabMixPlus (with SessionSaver)
[01:49] <kitche> Davidou: you have to pull the patches as lwn says to
[01:50] <fnf> firebird6191082: Try removing the "quiet" option in the boot item, maybe it would help spotting the error.
[01:50] <Davidou> they don't say hwo to do ...
[01:50] <Davidou> you mean, in this page http://lwn.net/Articles/188861/ ?
[01:50] <kitche> Davidou: yes
[01:50] <Davidou> I don't see
[01:50] <threat2> hi
[01:50] <kitche> Davidou: look at the part that says git
[01:50] <firebird6191082> fnf: I am not familiar with that, is that something I do from the GRUB menu, or do I need to be logged in to Ubuntu for that?
[01:51] <Davidou> aaahhh. ok. but, I don't know how to use git
[01:51] <kitche> Davidou: join #kitchetech and I'll explain it to you
[01:51] <Davidou> If I modify the files as explained here http://lists-archives.org/linux-usb-devel/10209-usb-remove-4088-byte-limit-on-usbfs-control-urbs.html , would it works ?
[01:51] <threat2> what package contains the man pages for the c std lib and other c functions and libraries (crypt, for example)
[01:51] <jrib> threat2: manpages-dev
[01:51] <threat2> jrib: nice
[01:51] <kitche> Davidou: yes but you need to know how to work with source code
[01:52] <earthian> ok i have found that in kernel configuration:      [?]  RAID-0 (striping) mode    (CONFIG_MD_RAID0)  (tristate)  (Help) however would that support my VIA SATA RAID defined on the controler bios chip?
[01:52] <Davidou> yes, sure. I already apt-get install linux-source-2.6.17
[01:52] <fnf> firebird6191082: From the GRUB menu, press 'e' (you possibly need to press 'p' and type in your password first) on the kernel you want to boot, then manage to clear the line starts with "quiet", btw also clear the "quiet splash" params in the line starts with "/initrd"
[01:52] <Davidou> then, I only have to understand how to compile the kernel ?
[01:53] <kitche> Davidou: nope you have to manually edit the source code if you do it by hand
[01:53] <Davidou> yes, but then ?
[01:53] <Davidou> after this
[01:53] <kitche> Davidou: theny ou build the source code
[01:53] <Davidou> ok, let's try with git. I come
[01:55] <fnf> Anyone has issue with loss of syntax coloring in Vim in Edgy ?. I couldn't set "syntax on" anymore, it said that the current version does not support that feature.
[01:55] <firebird6191082> fnf: Ok, thanks. I will give that a try.
[01:56] <cornell> Good evening...  I've a ubuntu workstation install on a home LAN.  Another machine, Win MCE has a printer which is shared (supposedly, as administrator, I've set the printer to share).  From the ubuntu machine I can see the Win machine, but can't connect, I'm not offered a login.  How do I connect to that printer?
[01:56] <Sensae> This is my crontab for root, it isn't running properly. Can someone take a look at it / help? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29379/
[01:57] <kwdbc> hi
[01:57] <kwdbc> i have a problem
[01:58] <kwdbc> when I start Gnome I see just my wallpaper without any icons andstripes, what should I do?
[01:58] <kwdbc> any suugestions??
[01:58] <sanmarcos> kwdbc: alt+f2 and execute nautilus
[01:58] <jrib> kwdbc: what stripes?
[01:58] <sanmarcos> kwdbc: or from a term
[01:58] <Sensae> Anyone? Crontab?
[01:58] <sanmarcos> kwdbc: the pannels
[01:58] <kwdbc> from a term? what this mean :P ?
[01:59] <Bastiq> When i start X it says that Build Operating System: 2.6.15.7 i686 and Current Operating system: blabla and then x won't start
[01:59] <Bastiq> anyone know how to fix it?
[01:59] <kwdbc> sanmarcos
[01:59] <wastrel> ubuntu
[01:59] <firebird6191082> fnf: the quiet splash param is in the line starting with kernel, do I still take out quiet splash?
[01:59] <kwdbc> aa from terminal
[01:59] <kwdbc> ok] 
[01:59] <sanmarcos> Sensae: remove the commas, man 5 crontab
[01:59] <kwdbc> thankyou so much sanmarcos :)
[01:59] <sanmarcos> kwdbc: I suppose you mean gnome-panel for the stripes, execute gnome-panel also
[01:59] <lightcap> why is edgy telling me "Note, selecting mysql-server-5.0 instead of mysql-server" when I try to explicitly apt-get install mysql-server-4.1?
[01:59] <sanmarcos> Bastiq: take a look at the log /var/log/xorg....
[01:59] <tonyyserver> Sensae: While I wouldn't think it should, I wonder if the range 23-7 is confusing it?
[02:00] <fnf> firebird6191082: Yes, it could help, after removing these params, you should add "vga=792" for a higher console resolution.
[02:00] <lightcap> or a better question, how do I make apt-get install 4.1?
[02:00] <firebird6191082> fnf: add that to the kernel line?
[02:00] <kitche> lightcap: they probably removed the old version of mysql for the newer version
[02:00] <Sensae> sanmarcos: Why do the commas cause issues?
[02:00] <fnf> firebird6191082: Yup, and did you take out the "quiet" line, that line's for GRUB ?
[02:01] <lightcap> kitche: is there a way to make it install 4.1 then?
[02:01] <sanmarcos> Sensae: read the manpage, if you want something every 15, do */15
[02:01] <firebird6191082> fnf: yes, I did. after these edits, do I restart and see what happens?
[02:01] <Sensae> sanmarcos: I'm reading the manpage, just curious why it would throw it off when the manpage says I can do that
[02:01] <lightcap> besides the obvious using a tarball from mysql
[02:01] <kitche> lightcap: probably compile it
[02:01] <sanmarcos> Sensae: maybe cron doesnt like you? why not check syslog?
[02:01] <fnf> firebird6191082: No, you may boot frmo there, as I want to know what error it's causing.
[02:01] <Lam_> how do i set konqueror's home page?
[02:02] <Bastiq> sanmarcos: I used grep EE and got Module ABI major version (0) dosen't match the server's version (1)
[02:02] <Bastiq> and a few more
[02:02] <mimithebrain> Lam_ : you can set that in it's preferences
[02:02] <dusk> what is the command from ubuntu 6.01 start screen (desktop) for a BASE server install
[02:02] <mztriz> I just installed Edgy Eft but it didn't have x so I installed xserver-xorg but now I'm hearing that I needed xserver-xorg-air-core... ?
[02:02] <sanmarcos> Bastiq: just reinstall the whole thing apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg
[02:02] <sanmarcos> Bastiq: sorry  apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg --reinstall
[02:02] <kitche> dusk: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
[02:03] <mimithebrain> Lam_ : from memory, it should be in the settings or tools menu, then konqueror settings, then homepage. Make sure you modify this when in webbrowsing mode ;)
[02:03] <sanmarcos> Bastiq: then dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:03] <dusk> kitche: heh, no
[02:03] <firebird6191082> fnf: Ok, I booted and now it brought me to the Ubuntu login screen.
[02:03] <kitche> dusk: well  the ubuntu desktop cd will install a full xorg system
[02:03] <mimithebrain> Is edgy worth the update from Dapper?
[02:03] <dusk> kitche: i want base
[02:04] <kitche> mztriz: do you want aiglx?
[02:04] <fnf> firebird6191082: that's strange :-/ We haven't really done anything yet. But it started, perhaps a good indication.
[02:04] <kitche> dusk: then grab the alternative cd
[02:04] <dusk> kitche: i just want to boot into a command prompt
[02:04] <mztriz> kitche: yes
[02:04] <Lam_> mimithebrain: ok thanks
[02:04] <dusk> kitche: which one
[02:04] <LorD-LsD> hello how can i change the owner ship of a harddrive i installed from root:root to normal user so i can write on the drive
[02:04] <firebird6191082> fnf: seems to be working fine now, logged in and everything. What would have caused that problem? I had restarted 5-6 times before I came here for help.
[02:04] <kitche> mztriz: the air-core is the one that you want then
[02:04] <mimithebrain> Lam_: cool, it worked?
[02:04] <mztriz> kitche: how can I install it?
[02:04] <kitche> dusk: what's the system a x86? or a x86_64
[02:05] <dusk> x86
[02:05] <bun-bun> !restricted
[02:05] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[02:05] <mztriz> kitche: I tried sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-air-core, but it comes up with something about now installation canidate
[02:05] <fnf> firebird6191082: I really don't know, maybe you could try to restart now and see what happens, all boot parameters you set before is temporary.
[02:05] <kitche> mztriz: think edgy has that by default
[02:05] <mimithebrain> !stuff
[02:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about stuff - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:05] <mimithebrain> nothing :|
[02:05] <Lam_> mimithebrain: nope. that changed the home button to redirect to a website. i wanted the first page to change upon loading
[02:05] <kitche> dusk: grab the i386 alternate cd
[02:05] <mztriz> kitche: when I installed edgy it was missing x completely, so I had to install xserver-xorg
[02:05] <dusk> kitche: there is no way to do a base server install from the desktop iso cd?
[02:06] <dusk> kitche: there has to be some option
[02:06] <jvai> ok ppeps.. gn
[02:06] <LorD-LsD> i have a harddrive thats owned by root and under the group root.. how can i change it to my owner ship so i can do more then just read.. its a vfat drive ?
[02:06] <mimithebrain> Lam_: If you load the webbrowser mode, it doesn't go to the webpage?
[02:06] <mztriz> kitche: it was before I knew about xserver-xorg-air-core
[02:06] <kitche> dusk: that's what the alternative cd is used for if you just want a base x without gnome
[02:06] <fnf> firebird6191082: What is the Ubuntu version ?.
[02:06] <Lam_> mimithebrain: nope. that changes the default behavior when in filemanager mode.  it's a global setting
[02:06] <Bastiq> sanmarcos: same error
[02:07] <Lam_> mimithebrain: that's ok. i figured it out
[02:07] <mimithebrain> Lam_: I used to use KDE, but it's been some time now... I believe there is a session type, of somesort, an editing dialog that you could add modes and remove them
[02:07] <kitche> mztriz: xserver-xorg has aiglx built in now from what I have read
[02:07] <mimithebrain> Lam_:I beleive you can set the homepage there.
[02:07] <slide> I can't seem to get in to my ubuntu install, is there anyway to upgeade it via a livecd?
[02:07] <dusk> kitche: whats the difference between server and alternative?
[02:07] <digilink> I installed a LAMP server running Edgy 6.10, by default should there be a cgi-bin directory under /var/www?
[02:07] <slide> it says its booting the kernel, but just stays there and doesnt od anything
[02:07] <mztriz> kitche: I don't think I have it though because beryl doesn't work
[02:07] <sanmarcos> Bastiq: if you want the painless way out reinstall, if not, then paste the whole log to a pastebin and ask here again and in #xorg, and also light some black candles and say voodoo backwards in a mirror
[02:07] <TGPO> LorD-LsD chmod it 'chmod 777 *' or
[02:08] <TGPO> something like that
[02:08] <mimithebrain> slide: sure, if you've got your files stored on another partition... go ahead :) You'll lose your installed software tho :( I think :/
[02:08] <firebird6191082> fnf: Ok, thanks for the help.
[02:08] <Bastiq> sanmarcos: Ouch, i'm in the console
[02:08] <kakado> do you know why the amd64 kernel no longer has "amd64" in the name?
[02:08] <LorD-LsD> tgpo um sure okay.. and how do i do that.. its /dev/hdb1 and its mounted under /media/hdb1
[02:08] <kitche> !aiglx > mztriz
[02:08] <slide> mimithebrain: how? the 'installer' makes you actually partition and then im assuming it makes you format it, or does it just install over the stuff already there? and if so, thats not really an upgrade so i dont want to do that
[02:09] <kitche> dusk: server just installs a console, alternative can be used for many things if you want
[02:09] <firebird6191082> fnf: I am using Edgy. My cable internet went out there for a second, sorry for the delayed reply.
[02:09] <dusk> kitche: is there a difference in kernel
[02:09] <mztriz> kitche: mztriz@coinsandtea:~$ !aiglx
[02:09] <mztriz> bash: !aiglx: event not found
[02:09] <kitche> mztriz: !aiglx is a switch for ubotu
[02:09] <kitche> dusk: nope
[02:09] <fnf> firebird6191082: Did you do an upgrade from Dapper ?.
[02:09] <TGPO> as root try 'chmod /dev/hdb1 777 *'
[02:09] <mimithebrain> slide: You'd have to check the installer, you have the option of editing yourself the partitions and which gets used.
[02:09] <firebird6191082> fnf: No, clean install.
[02:09] <Jahooty> hey, how do i run the device manager in xubuntu?
[02:09] <mimithebrain> slide: as far as upgrade rather than wipe out... I don't know
[02:10] <slide> k
[02:10] <LorD-LsD> so sudo chmod /dev/hdb1 777 *
[02:10] <Jahooty> i dont see it in a menu anywhere
[02:10] <mimithebrain> slide; I know there is some sort of apt-get distupgrade...
[02:10] <kitche> mztriz: ubotu should have sent you a message
[02:10] <TGPO> lord-lsd give it a whirl
[02:10] <slide> mimithebrain: yea, thats actually what I did before (to upgrade to 6.06), which has left me not being able to get in at all
[02:10] <fnf> firebird6191082: Is it working normally after restarting ?. If it is, you may want to see the log files.
[02:10] <dusk> kitche: where is the documentation for alternative install?
[02:10] <LorD-LsD> chmod: invalid mode: `/dev/hdb1'
[02:10] <LorD-LsD> thats the error it gave
[02:10] <kitche> !alternative > dusk
[02:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alternative - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:11] <mimithebrain> slide: did you try reconfiguring xorg?
[02:11] <TGPO> lord-lsd tell me you left the 's on there
[02:11] <slide> mimithebrain: it doesnt even boot the kernel, it says 'Loading and booting the kernel....' (or whatever it actualy is) but then doesnt do anything
[02:11] <mimithebrain> slide: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ... might work
[02:11] <mimithebrain> slide: oh geez... um...
[02:11] <firebird6191082> fnf: just restarting now, will let you know when it is finished and what it does. Also, while I am waiting, do you know if in Gnome there is a way do have different backgrounds for each workspace?
[02:12] <TGPO> lord-lsd wait a sec where is it mounted to in your fstab?
[02:12] <Ropechoborra> !mp3

[02:12] <LorD-LsD> yes it is
[02:12] <mimithebrain> slide: I really don't know. Maybe an upgrade isn't such a good idea in that case.
[02:12] <TGPO> lord-lsd where?
[02:12] <slide> heh
[02:12] <fnf> firebird6191082: I'm not aware of one, besides, my knowledge on GNOME is pretty fuzzy, I'm not using a DE.
[02:12] <mimithebrain> slide: maybe someone else knows better than me... anyone??
[02:12] <Fackamato> hm
[02:12] <slide> yea, id like to get in to do it, but i cant and I dont have enough room to clean off the hd
[02:12] <Fackamato> can't seem to find xfce4-systray in the repos... any ideas?
[02:13] <TGPO> lord-lsd whats its mount point?
[02:13] <LorD-LsD> the fstab is um  /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 vfat default 0 0
[02:13] <firebird6191082> fnf: It booted normally and I logged in and everything.
[02:13] <Zyfo> how do I uninstall opera?
[02:13] <mimithebrain> firebird6191082: I didn't see any ways to do that yet :(
[02:13] <LjL> Zyfo: sudo apt-get remove opera
[02:13] <TGPO> lord-lsd theres the issue
[02:13] <jrib> Zyfo: how did you install it?
[02:13] <LorD-LsD> okay so how do i correct the issue
[02:13] <mikeconcepts> anyone able to vnc into edgy with beryl running?
[02:13] <fnf> firebird6191082: You can however try to install another Window Manager, some supports that feature.
[02:13] <kitche> dusk: it's like the debian installer
[02:14] <TGPO> lord-lsd make a folder in your home directory
[02:14] <Zyfo> jrib, I don't remember, I'll try remove hnow though
[02:14] <killown> have firefox 2 for linux?
[02:14] <mimithebrain> fnf: still sad that this isn't supported :(
[02:14] <mikedoty> Hi folk.  I have good news that I'm running ubuntu now :)  I need to install drivers for my nvidia card, though, since I'm limited to 800x600 resolution right now.  I'm on this page, which I believe should have what I'm looking for (http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html) ... which drivers do I want to download?
[02:14] <TGPO> lord-lsd then mount it to that folder not media
[02:14] <mimithebrain> firefox2 is pretty neat :)
[02:14] <Zyfo> ah worked, ty LjL and jrib
[02:14] <fnf> firebird6191082: I guess that's okay for now, just examnine the log files for any abnormality.
[02:14] <firebird6191082> mimithebrain:Ok, Thanks. I know KDE can do it, from reading on the forums, wasn't sure if that feature was maybe added in the new version of Gnome. I have the Kubuntu CDs, both Alternate and Desktop. Can I install KDE from those CDs.
[02:14] <kitche> mikedoty: ia32 if your on an x86 machine
[02:14] <jrib> !nvidia > mikedoty
[02:14] <LorD-LsD> i dont see how that would make a differnce .. i had another drive mounted the same way all i did was put a new drive in.. and updated the filesystem in the fstab.. ?
[02:15] <mimithebrain> firebird6191082: sometimes, I miss KDE :(
[02:15] <mikedoty> Ok, thank ya kitche
[02:15] <vandit2k7> Hi can anybody help me with grub???
[02:15] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell vandit2k7 about grub
[02:15] <firebird6191082> mimithebrain: I mean install it as another Windows manager, not install it over gnome and lose gnome.
[02:15] <mimithebrain> !grub
[02:15] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:15] <Sensae> I checked the syslog, and cron is firing the usermod -L polaris, however the account can still log on
[02:15] <fnf> mimithebrain: There're some known window managers that support it.
[02:15] <jrib> mikedoty: you can install the drivers from the ubuntu repositories, ubotu sent you instructions
[02:15] <mimithebrain> fnf: yeah. but not gnome :(
[02:15] <killown> have firefox 2 for linux?
[02:15] <vandit2k7> no I need special help with grub
[02:16] <LorD-LsD> i just need to change the ownership of the drive off of root and to user.. but i dont know how to do that
[02:16] <mikedoty> Ya, I'm readin' over 'em now...
[02:16] <kitche> killown: yes firefox 2 came out the same time as it did for windows
[02:16] <mimithebrain> for nvidia, whoever it was... wouldn't it be IA32?
[02:16] <jrib> !vfat > LorD-LsD

[02:16] <LorD-LsD> jrib huh ?
[02:16] <firebird6191082> Am I able to install KDE as another Window Manager from the CDs, instead of downloading it?
[02:16] <dusk> kitche: ok thanks,dling the alternate version now
[02:16] <mimithebrain> !stuff > mimithebrain
[02:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about stuff - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:16] <Pockets> mimithebrain: IA32 just means Intel Similar Architecture 32 bit
[02:16] <jrib> LorD-LsD: ubotu should have sent you a private message
[02:17] <kitche> dusk: it lets you customize a ubuntu install more then a desktop cd will
[02:17] <fnf> mimithebrain: GNOME just utilizes a window manager beneath it (I don't recall what it is now though), if you install another WM, you'll have a chance to select one before logging in.
[02:17] <mimithebrain> Pockets: ah, right, and we don't know the arch yet...
[02:17] <wastrel> fnf:  metacity
[02:17] <Sensae> Anyone? Crontab is firing a usermod -L polaris, but account doesn't actually get locked.
[02:17] <mimithebrain> fnf: swweeet!
[02:17] <killown> kitche I install firefox 2 but when run it  say  firefox version 1.4
[02:17] <TGPO> lord-lsd man chgrp and then chgrp it to user
[02:17] <mimithebrain> !wm > mimithebrain
[02:17] <Pockets> Man..
[02:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:17] <kitche> killown: did you get it from the mozilla website?
[02:17] <wastrel> !msgthebot
[02:17] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[02:17] <Pockets> They really need to hurry up and "officially" support Ebuntu.
[02:17] <LorD-LsD> jrib i know how to see the partitions.. its the ownership of the drive thats screwing me.. basicly i had a 10 gig drive .. i took it out put 120 gig drive in.. i changed the filesystem in the fstab .. but not it mounts as root and i can only read fromt he drive i cant delete or write to it
[02:18] <jrib> LorD-LsD: the page explains what you need to do (this is vfat right?)
[02:18] <killown> kitche yes
[02:18] <fnf> firebird6191082: You need to include that CD as a repos, or just using dpkg to install.
[02:18] <killown> http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/all-rc.html
[02:18] <TGPO> LorD-LsD 'man chgrp'
[02:18] <LorD-LsD> yes its a vfat drive now.. ill read it
[02:19] <fnf> !metacity
[02:19] <LorD-LsD> tgpo how do you have a man .. i always get stuck in a term
[02:19] <ubotu> metacity: A lightweight GTK2 based Window Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 1:2.16.3-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 385 kB, installed size 764 kB
[02:19] <jrib> if it's vfat he should be using umask, not chgrp
[02:19] <firebird6191082> fnf: Ok, How can I add it as a repo, I assume editing /etc/apt/sources.list, but what exact entry to I enter. It is Kubuntu 6.10 (Edgy)
[02:19] <kitche> killown: well firefox 2 been out for couple of days now so the rc isn't even used anymore but it's just a .tar.gz which you have to put the binaries in the right place
[02:19] <Geoffrey2> are flash drives generally hot swappable?
[02:19] <Sensae> Crontab is firing a usermod -L polaris, but account doesn't actually get locked.
[02:19] <mimithebrain> Geoffrey: yeah
[02:20] <kitche> killown: also there is a ubuntu package for edgy
[02:20] <mimithebrain> Geoffrey2: If you wrote something to it, "eject" it first (or sync)
[02:20] <TGPO> LorD-LsD you open the man in a terminal
[02:20] <killown> kitche I go chek it now
[02:20] <LorD-LsD> tgpo okay.. but after i read it.. how do i exit from it esc doesnt do it.. cntl-x wont exit.. i have to shut down the term to get out
[02:20] <TGPO> LorD-LsD q exits man pages
[02:20] <lakin> anyone have tips for tracking down the hard-lockups on my laptop?  They started after I installed edgy.  The only reliable way I can reproduce them is to copy some large file via SFTP w/ Nautilus over my LAN ..
[02:21] <fnf> firebird6191082: Since you install it one time only, it's probably a good idea to just use "dpkg -i" to directly install it from the CD, navigate to the package directory containing KDE in the CD, then install from there.
[02:21] <LorD-LsD> thats simple enough to remember
[02:21] <jrib> Sensae: you aren't using your user's crontab right?
[02:21] <dusk> kitche: yea, the server install I dont think is for me
[02:21] <mimithebrain> lakin: this is a madwifi issue probably
[02:21] <dusk> kitche: where is the fastest source to dl it
[02:21] <Sensae> jrib: No, the crontab is running as root
[02:21] <mimithebrain> lakin: drop in a console, and type "lsmod | grep ath" for the fun of it
[02:21] <Geoffrey2> mimithebrain, where would that option be found?
[02:21] <kitche> dusk: pick the closest mirror to you
[02:21] <lakin> mimithebrain: I'm not using madwifi and that command returns no results
[02:22] <jrib> Sensae: do you get any mail from cron?
[02:22] <mimithebrain> lakin: k, it must be something else
[02:22] <dusk> kitche: i was thinking about torrents, but thanks :) its speeding up now
[02:22] <mikeconcepts> anyone able to vnc into edgy with beryl running?
[02:22] <fnf> firebird6191082: If you prefer the 2nd way, you may as well take /etc/apt/sources.list as a sample, it does include one entry.
[02:22] <mimithebrain> Geoffrey2: Insert a device, write stuff to it, right click off the desktop, click eject.
[02:22] <kitche> dusk: well torrents work also if enough people are seeding it
[02:22] <Sensae> jrib: It isn't set up with any address, but looking in syslog it shows it processes the command at the right time, and tries to send a mail out
[02:22] <mimithebrain> lakin: Does anything come up in the logs?
[02:22] <Geoffrey2> ah, on the desktop...found it, thanks :)
[02:22] <lakin> Damn ... I just did it again, this time with terms open to /var/log/messages, /var/log/dmesg, and /var/log/syslog and nothing suspicious
[02:23] <dusk> kitche: yea. ok thank sagain
[02:23] <mikedoty> I tried to install the IA32, but it errors and says I must install it as root.  What am I doing wrongly / how do I install it as root?
[02:23] <HaroldJohnson> Hey everyone
[02:23] <firebird6191082> fnf: I had the Kubuntu Dapper DVD and when I had inserted that it automatically added it as a repo. With the Kubuntu Edgy CD, it didn't do that.
[02:23] <mimithebrain> lakin: did you try switching quickly to a tty, set the log level appropriatly, and watching the errors fly by?
[02:24] <kitche> mikedoty: you have to sudo ./NVIDIA* and have the kernel headers installed
[02:24] <fnf> !sudo > mikedoty
[02:24] <boris55> is there a freenode person on this chat?
[02:24] <mikeconcepts> is it a common problem not yet solved vnc into edgy/beryl?
[02:24] <lakin> mimithebrain: how do I switch the loglevel?
[02:24] <HaroldJohnson> boris55, seek out
[02:25] <lakin> mimithebrain: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29478/
[02:25] <mimithebrain> lakin: Alt+SysRQ+[0-8] 
[02:25] <boris55> haroldjohnson: not sure what you mean?
[02:25] <lakin> mimithebrain: I assume that I want something closer to 8?
[02:25] <HaroldJohnson> boris55, sorry...one moment
[02:26] <HaroldJohnson> boris55, sorry, nevermind.  apologies
[02:26] <Sensae> I finally got it to work. I had to put /usr/sbin/usermod and /usr/bin/killall
[02:26] <mimithebrain> lakin:yes
[02:26] <Tim90> hey
[02:26] <fnf> firebird6191082: Sorry I'm not using either an install DVD or Kubuntu, but the very first line in /etc/apt/sources.list may help: deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025.1)] / edgy main restricted

[02:28] <kitche> Tim90: you have to download the binary installer from teamspeak's website
[02:28] <Tim90> :(
[02:29] <TGPO> killown that doesnt change the built in version
[02:29] <maxflax> beryl is only eyecandy.
[02:29] <Sensae> I've got the teamspeak binary installer, however whenever I try to ./server_linux I get an "Error starting daemon. Aborting"
[02:29] <lakin> mimithebrain: nothing suspicious
[02:30] <TGPO> killown you'll either have to update your PATH's (a pain in the ass) or install it via a .deb
[02:30] <killown> TGPO I already it thanks frined
[02:30] <killown> friend*
[02:30] <TGPO> killown no probs
[02:31] <mimithebrain> lakin: oy. I would guess it's either: the hardware is faulty (don't think so), or a module (either video or wireless) is crashing your system
[02:32] <root> ubuntu-es
[02:32] <lakin> mimithebrain: yeah, it's likely a module.  The fact that I can reliably set it off with heavy network usage (wired) leads me to believe it's the wired network module.
[02:32] <mimithebrain> killown: I just use Midnight commander...
[02:32] <cyphase> i know that legally, we can't include multimedia codecs on the installer cd, but could we have the cd automatically download them from the repositories after installation?

[02:37] <LorD-LsD> is the Gnome on edgy a newver version then the one on dapper.. and if so is there a way to upgrade to that version under dapper
[02:37] <kitche> Lord-LsD: edgy uses 2.16 gnome
[02:38] <Flannel> LorD-LsD: no
[02:38] <Pockets> Screw gnome, go E.
[02:38] <LorD-LsD> what version does dapper use ?
[02:38] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: dapp 2.14, edgy 2.16
[02:38] <siccness> 2.14 or something
[02:38] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: nothing new between the two really
[02:38] <LorD-LsD> so can i update to 2.16
[02:38] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: you could backport stuff from edgy, but I do not recommend it
[02:39] <kitche> well 2.16 has better 3d support really
[02:39] <Tim90> whats this ? /dev/ttys1
[02:39] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: if you are a newbie, else you can go ahead and get in line for a long night of paij
[02:39] <sanmarcos> pain
[02:39] <sanmarcos> Tim90: your terminal
[02:39] <siccness> a terminal
[02:39] <sanmarcos> Tim90: eveyrthing in unix is a file, *YOU* are a file
=== Cas_ is now known as Cas
[02:39] <bruenig> LorD-LsD, have fun http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/2.16/
[02:39] <LorD-LsD> yes im a newb.. but i like some of the newer features that 2.16 offers.. i know there isnt a deb package for it yet.. but it can be compiled right
[02:40] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: just upgrade to edgy, or compile gnome by your own
[02:40] <Tim90> xmms can be controlled by remote control /irMAN
[02:40] <Tim90> i have mce remote
[02:40] <dkr> is anyone using nedit successfully on edgy? (I just upgraded from dapper and when i try to run nedit I get: "X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)  Major opcode of failed request:  70 (X_PolyFillRectangle)"  already tried aptitude reinstall
[02:40] <siccness> LorD-LsD: compiling gnome wont take long either :D
[02:40] <sanmarcos> Tim90: yes, just configure lirc
[02:40] <sanmarcos> Tim90: but lirc is broken in edgy, so use CVS
[02:40] <Tim90> help me man im not very good
[02:40] <LorD-LsD> i would upgrade to edgy .. if i didnt have to loose all my settings from this sytem
[02:41] <dkr> why would you lose settings?
[02:41] <TGPO> Lord-LsD ?!? huh?
[02:41] <sanmarcos> LorD-LsD: you wont loose nothing, just your virgnity
[02:41] <Tim90> i realy like edgy
[02:41] <Hirvinen> LorD-LsD: Unless you have a lot of experience with breaking up and then fixing your system, which you told you don't, either dist-upgrade to Edgy or stick with Dapper.
[02:41] <sanmarcos> Tim90: I like mustard and codeine
[02:41] <LorD-LsD> its an all new install isnt it.. means id have to reset up everything i did with dapper right
[02:41] <Tim90> all new to me
[02:41] <siccness> Hirvinen: bah, I wanted to see how long it took him to compile gnome.
[02:41] <Tim90> so whats cvs
[02:41] <TGPO> LorD-LsD change your sources and then update then dist-upgrade
[02:41] <LorD-LsD> sic i wouldnt care how long it takes.. thats why ive got a 360 :)
[02:41] <dcraven> LorD-LsD, your settings will remain.
[02:42] <LorD-LsD> all my xgl settings my and my custom stuff will remain.. ?
[02:42] <siccness> :)
[02:42] <Hirvinen> LorD-LsD: Please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades for how to upgrade.
[02:42] <dcraven> LorD-LsD, if you attempt to compile and install gnome yourself, I garuntee you will lose your settings. heh
[02:43] <TGPO> LorD-LsD and your mind
[02:43] <siccness> dcraven: can almost guarantee you'll lose more than that ;)
[02:43] <LorD-LsD> right.. so i guess im sticking with current.. anyway i solved my hd issues i was here for a few minutes ago just came back to thank the communinty
[02:43] <LorD-LsD> ive now been MS free for 3 months
[02:43] <siccness> Congrats!
[02:43] <TGPO> LorD-LsD what was the final solution?
[02:43] <Tim90> any way i can put this mce remote to good use
[02:43] <dcraven> Nice, LorD-LsD
[02:44] <Tim90> lhmc
[02:44] <Tim90> lmpc
[02:44] <Geoffrey2> hmmm, is there anything that really stands out in Edgy that would warrant upgrading?
[02:44] <matt_> how do I zip a folder?
[02:44] <LorD-LsD> /dev/hdb1   /media/hdb1   vfat   user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000   0   0  putting that in my fstab was the solution TGP0
[02:44] <LorD-LsD> where the user,fmask.... i had defualt
[02:44] <siccness> matt, tar
[02:45] <dcraven> matt_, tar cvzf whatever.tar.gz /yourfolder/
[02:45] <Tim90> LorD-LsD:Go to bed
[02:45] <foulox>  I'm running 6.10 on a dell x1 (super tiny laptop) I got  the display running nicely with 915resolution.  How can get the display to work nicely on a flat screen monitor that's support 1280x1024?  Ideally how can I can dual monitors working?
[02:45] <LorD-LsD> since im here let me ask this.. does linux have any way work with the xbox 360 for streaming the music and what not like media center edition does
[02:45] <matt_> not tar though
[02:45] <TGPO> LorD-LsD every day is a learning experiance .... good to know
[02:45] <matt_> a .zip file?
[02:45] <siccness> LorD-LsD: apparently not
[02:45] <dcraven> People still use zip?
[02:46] <siccness> dcraven: apparently so.
[02:46] <dcraven> matt_, there is a zip command.
[02:46] <siccness> i thought it died 10 years ago :|
[02:46] <Tim90> there must be a way to get my mce remote working with xmms
[02:46] <eracc> info-zip
[02:46] <matt_> is there anyway to do this without a command
[02:46] <siccness> use archive manager
[02:46] <coastermaster> what is the package that contains gcc?
[02:46] <TGPO> Tim90 at this point I would have to say google is your friend
[02:46] <coastermaster> wait nevermind
[02:46] <dcraven> matt_, like with your mind?
[02:47] <eracc> For handling zip files - http://www.info-zip.org/
[02:47] <CablD_Ubuntu> what is the command to see if 6.10 installed my ati driver?
[02:47] <e2equiel> join #hackers
[02:47] <matt_> no a command that's not from a console
[02:47] <e2equiel> hola
[02:47] <siccness> matt_: open up archive manager
[02:47] <Pelo> foulox,  if it is just a matter of screen resolution you might have to edit the xorg.conf file with the extra resolution and with the proper refresh rate for your screen
[02:47] <dcraven> matt_, archive manager can probably do it I'm guessing.
[02:47] <Tim90>  TGPO:wrong synatic is the answer
[02:47] <matt_> ok
[02:48] <ShadeT> matt_, If in gnome, right click the file and click "Create Archive..."
[02:48] <matt_> ok
[02:48] <matt_> thanks
[02:48] <matt_> I see it now
[02:48] <siccness> and then nautilus will crash to a burning heap
[02:48] <matt_> I'm stupid
[02:48] <dcraven> *cricket* *cricket*
[02:48] <dcraven> hehe.. Just kidding.
[02:48] <method|> im trying to install edgy right now and i'm at the partitioning part where i have to indicate where the root partition "/" should go. After I select where the root partition should go and hit continue the stupid installer tells me: "No root file system". But i have clearly indicated where i want the root partition to go. What should I do?
[02:49] <|Jackal|> method:  re-create the root partition
[02:49] <siccness> method|: heh, try again
[02:49] <phillip> should i stay at dapper or go to edgy? since so many are having problems
[02:49] <dcraven> matt_, you may need to install that zip package anyways so archive manager can use it.
[02:49] <method|> |jacka|: what do you mean?
[02:49] <|Jackal|> delete the old partition, and then re-create it
[02:49] <sydhart> hi all. I'm making a custom Ubuntu boot CD (based on 6.10 desktop). does anyone know how to change the default resolution which now tops out at 1024x768 @60Hz ?

[02:50] <TGPO> phillip: people are always having problems, edgy doesnt change it that much
[02:50] <Pelo> sydhart,  by editing the xorg.conf file

[02:51] <kitche> !downgrade > phillip
[02:52] <Pelo> sydhart,   are you just working of  the live cd ?
[02:52] <foulox>  I'm running 6.10 on a dell x1 (super tiny laptop) I got  the display running nicely with 915resolution.  How can get the display to work nicely on a flat screen monitor that's support 1280x1024?  Ideally how can I can dual monitors working?
[02:52] <shadowhywind> just for curiosty, anybody that did an upgrade to edgy, Are you having aproblem with your swap (ksysguard says its not on)
[02:52] <phillip> kitche: so i should just stay at dapper? is edgy that much of an improvement?
[02:52] <sanmarcos> foulox: xinerama
[02:52] <sanmarcos> philip__: edgy is NOT an iprovement
[02:52] <sanmarcos> philip__: it was rushed to my taste
[02:52] <mikeconcepts> anyone able to vnc into edgy with beryl running?
[02:52] <compudaze> yeah
[02:52] <compudaze> can't do anything thought
[02:52] <compudaze> need to disable 3d
[02:53] <phillip> so why is everyone upgrading?
[02:53] <kitche> phillip: well it's more up to date hence why it's name is edgy means it can break a system
[02:53] <mikeconcepts> same here
[02:53] <siccness> because people are always under the idea that "newer means better"
[02:53] <phillip> o
[02:53] <Pelo> philip for the same reason we pick at scabs
[02:53] <TGPO> phiilip, personally edgy is what moved me to ubuntu
[02:53] <compudaze> edgy is the 1st release i've used
[02:53] <compudaze> works well for me
[02:53] <foulox> THANK YOU SANMARCOS!
[02:53] <Pelo> later folks
[02:53] <bruenig> what is the package name of add/remove applications?
[02:53] <roverr> shadowhywind:  all 3 of my swap paritions work.  i did one fresh install from alt cd, one upgrade from dapper using the 386 desktop cd
[02:53] <mike_> Ok so my router rights to my resolve.conf file constantly and it puts in giberish anybody else have this issue
[02:54] <phillip> i guess ill stay at dapper.
[02:54] <sanmarcos> foulox: how did I help you again?
[02:54] <TGPO> phiilip, I was die hard debian, the last 2 releases of ubuntu left me cold, then edgy cameout and wow
[02:54] <siccness> why do you have 3 swaps for?
[02:54] <Tim90> how do i navigate to a USB devive /dev ... then what
[02:54] <Tim90> device
[02:54] <bimberi> bruenig: gnome-app-install
[02:54] <roverr> siccness, spread the load over multiple spindles is faster
[02:54] <sanmarcos> Tim90: usb mass storage is automonted in /media, check the mount command
[02:54] <sanmarcos> Tim90: if you are running gnome at least
[02:54] <shadowhywind> roverr that is good to hear, My upgrade and a Friends upgrade the swaps got all freaky! but they are fixed now. Just seeing if anyone else had a problem
[02:54] <siccness> Right.
[02:54] <bruenig> bimberi, it would be safe to remove that?
[02:55] <foulox> sanmarcos you told me to check out Xinerama
[02:55] <compudaze> if you use swapspace you need more memory =)
[02:55] <infernaljesus> I cannot connect to my wireless network from Ubuntu 6.10 I've tried dhcp and static, I'm pretty sure the passkey is correct...
[02:55] <bimberi> bruenig: yes, although why you'd want to is intruging
[02:55] <infernaljesus> what could be the problem?
[02:55] <foulox> Now I atleast have a starting point
[02:55] <siccness> compudaze: heh
[02:55] <dkr> hrm, the editor I use to write code and the app I use to listen to music no longer work.  I'm going to have to say this is a failed upgrade. :)
[02:55] <Tim90> sanmarcos:im trying to select a device , like a remote device for xmms to use
[02:55] <phillip> what is the linux equivelant of Classic Media Player and all its codecs? i want my machine to play almost evevry video i throw at it... anyone know?
[02:55] <bruenig> I never use it and it gets annoying from time to time when I accidentally click on it and have to wait the 3 mins it takes to launch
[02:55] <compudaze> phillip: check out vlc
[02:55] <sanmarcos> foulox: ahh yes, and if you have nvidia/ati, check their solutions, in nvidia its just enabling 4 lines of twinview
[02:55] <siccness> phillip: vlc
[02:55] <hav0k> im sure this has been the topic in her as of late, but
[02:55] <dkr> (not to mention the sacrilege of dropping tcsh)
[02:55] <Pockets> phillip: Mplayer or Xmms
[02:55] <mike998> I am having problems with wireless - Broadcom to be exact.  I just installed edgy, and I have followed the fwcutter how to try to get the wireless running.  nm-applet doesn't show any wireless interfaces however iwconfig shows eth1 as a wireless interface, but iwlist eth1 scan shows no results, even though I am sat next to the router and can connect to it through another device - does anyone have any ideas how to
[02:55] <mike998>  fix this?
[02:56] <sanmarcos> Tim90: /dev/lirc usually
[02:56] <compudaze> it's pretty good and cross platform
[02:56] <roverr> compudaze:  i'm not buying more ram for these boxes.  getting a new box is better :)
[02:56] <hav0k> im having troubles with my X since upgrading to edgy
[02:56] <bimberi> bruenig: fair enough :)
[02:56] <Tim90> sanmarcos:at the moment it has dev/ttyS1 with is a comport
[02:56] <mike998> phillip: ensure you install all the codecs as well including the w32codecs deb

[02:56] <Geoffrey2> anyone in here familar with the Evolution package?
[02:56] <bimberi> !anyone
[02:56] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:57] <compudaze> compiz was easy to setup, i'm running 0.2.2, thinkin about checkin out the dev 0.3.3 rls
[02:57] <hav0k> so how do i get it working again?
[02:57] <threeseas> where might I find info on installing on a mac PPC? (ubuntu 6.10 ppc)
[02:57] <hav0k> i had to edit my xorg.conf
[02:57] <hav0k> and something to the end of it
[02:57] <kitche> compudaze: I don't even look at compiz anymore since beryl came out but hten again I m not a gnome user
[02:58] <compudaze> which gfx card? nvidia?
[02:58] <compudaze> compiz has been more stable for me than beryl
[02:58] <hav0k> compudaze, me?
[02:58] <compudaze> i have both installed but currently running compiz
[02:58] <compudaze> hav0k: yeah
[02:58] <Geoffrey2> I am trying to set up Evolution to access multiple email accounts, each one with it's own set of boxes (inbox, draft, sent, trash, etc)...I've seen screenshots of Evolution set up that way, but the documentation says nothing on how to do this...
[02:58] <hav0k> compudaze, i have an ati, with the fglrx driver.
[02:59] <hav0k> it worked before i upgraded to edgy...
[02:59] <siccness> hav0k: you tried vesa?
[02:59] <hav0k> vesa?
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> what is openssh
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> is that required to have ssh
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> i thought ubuntu came with sshd
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> all you have to do is enable it
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> right?
[02:59] <kitche> mikeymike-linux: yes openssh is ssh and ubuntu doesn't coem with openssh
[02:59] <monofonik> i'm trying to install edgy on my powerbook g4, and when resizing the partition, it's taking quite a while (probably 45 minutes now).. does it take a while?
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> no need to apt-get anything
[02:59] <compudaze> mikeymike-linux: openssh is the ssh package
[02:59] <mikeymike-linux> oh.........
[02:59] <compudaze> openssh-client and openssh-server

[03:00] <fiXXXerMet> I have windows on this machine.  If I install edgy eft, will it configure to dual boot, or do I have to do something special?
[03:01] <Rav|strangler> anyone good with xgl?

[03:02] <compudaze> hav0k: sorry, not sure about ati's compiz setup, i just know the nvidia setup was easy for me
[03:02] <Nandu> I need some help, I managed to mess up trying to install the nvidia driver, now X won't boot up at all =(
[03:03] <VividHazE> QUESTION: anyone know the apt-get command to install MP3 support on amarok?

[03:03] <Nandu> this happened after installing nvidia-glx
[03:03] <Commander-Crowe> hi I installed nvidia-glx
[03:03] <cliebow_> Nandu: maybe dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will get you going
[03:03] <|Jackal|> hak0k:  i went through the same process to install fglrx but everytime i do, it comes up to a black screen
[03:04] <|Jackal|> hav0k*
[03:04] <kitche> Nandu you can also try nvidia-xconfig that might help you also
[03:04] <Nandu> cliebow: thanks, I'll try
[03:04] <compudaze> VividHazE: try the package libxine-extracodecs
[03:04] <mike998> guess not... thanks anyway

[03:11] <bsdfox> compudaze: pretty sure that's wrong
[03:11] <phillip> is Crossover linux pirated much?
[03:11] <Adam_G> Quick question: is it OK to have lots of sshd' s running? Like 15 (in fact I'm using one now). I use FreeNX and SSH extensively, I just don't know if this is normal...
[03:11] <duane> it's something like dkpg-reconfig fontconfig anyone know the exact syntax?
[03:11] <kitche> bsdfox: nope it's the truth with the beta drivers you don't need aiglx or xgl
[03:11] <compudaze> aiglx is enable per default anyway
[03:12] <duane> hey there's a command to configure font settings. it's something like dkpg-reconfig fontconfig anyone know the exact syntax?
[03:12] <compudaze> but the beta nvidia drivers directly render
[03:12] <bsdfox> you don't need aiglx or xgl for what?
[03:12] <kitche> bsdfox to run compiz with the nvidia beta drivers
[03:12] <bsdfox> you don't think that's just aiglx "working"?
[03:13] <compudaze> u can turn aiglx off
[03:13] <compudaze> and compiz will work with the beta nvidia drivers

[03:17] <adele_> kitche, i think I have the latest drivers installed.

[03:17] <Uberriffi1> anyone here having issues with Emacs and Edgy?

[03:17] <coolpaul900>  hey how do I know if I installed wine correct?

[03:23] <Uberriffi1> MusiKing, i have ATI 9600 on my laptop
[03:23] <mikedoty> In the process of trying to install the nvidia drivers for ubuntu, I have somehow managed to screw something up, and now I can only load a command line interface in ubuntu.  What can I do to remedy this situation?
[03:23] <kitche> adele_: you can check the xorg.0.log to see if fglrx is your driver
[03:23] <factotum> aterm or eterm... your thoughts
[03:23] <Alakazamz0r> My Ubuntu CD's came in the mail!
[03:23] <factotum> lol
[03:23] <Alakazamz0r> They came with STICKERS!
[03:23] <factotum> right on
[03:23] <Alakazamz0r> r0ck1n
[03:23] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing: are you running the mobility or PCI/AGP version of the card?
[03:24] <factotum> stickers??!!! I want stickers!
[03:24] <Alakazamz0r> yep
[03:24] <Alakazamz0r> 8 of them
[03:24] <factotum> well, actually wife wants one
[03:24] <brandon> j #firefox
[03:24] <sidewalk> thing is
[03:24] <wastrel> Alakazamz0r:  do you have pictures of the stickers?
[03:24] <Alakazamz0r> hehe
[03:24] <factotum> it would look snazzy on the back of her car i think
[03:24] <sidewalk> im using gnome
[03:24] <Alakazamz0r> i can take a picture of them.
[03:24] <sidewalk> how can i chose to use beryl instead of gnome ?

[03:24] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing: hello?
[03:25] <bimberi> mikedoty: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and choose the "nv" driver
[03:25] <adele_> kitche, how do i check that?
[03:25] <wastrel> we need to see a picture
[03:25] <factotum> hey, wonder what this button does...
[03:25] <Megaqwerty> For some reason after upgrading to edgy eft, Tomboy stopped working. Does anyone have an idea as to why?
[03:25] <wastrel> what's tomboy?
[03:26] <bimberi> sidewalk: they're separate things beryl is a window manager, gnome is a desktop environment
[03:26] <Megaqwerty> wastrel: note taking software
[03:26] <dkr> wastrel: a girl that acts like a guy
[03:26] <Megaqwerty> it was supposed to be packaged with edgy

[03:27] <Alakazamz0r> i'll paste the link in a second
[03:27] <mikedoty> Thanks.  brb
[03:27] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing:  What driver are you using in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
[03:27] <bimberi> sidewalk: no, you can use beryl with gnome.  Gnome's default window manager is Metacity and you would replace that with beryl
[03:27] <brandon> Just updated to firefox version 2 but it still appears to ignore the -width and -height options.  Does anyone know of a work around for this?  I'm not sure if it's just related to the ubuntu or all distro's, and the ff channel is silent.
[03:27] <factotum> anyone know how to go about changing font dpi via xfce?
[03:27] <bimberi> sidewalk: beryl-manager lets you choose between the two
[03:27] <sidewalk> i have gdm
[03:28] <MusicKing> uberriffi1 it's a fresh install, so whatever is default
[03:28] <sidewalk> when i run beryl-manager my X hangs
[03:28] <Alakazamz0r> ok
[03:28] <Alakazamz0r> who wants the picture of the stickers
[03:28] <Alakazamz0r> i'll DCC it.

[03:28] <jrib> !ask | Megaqwerty
[03:28] <ubotu> Megaqwerty: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:28] <bimberi> sidewalk: gdm is a separate thing again, a display manager
[03:28] <Alakazamz0r> wastrel?
[03:29] <adele_> kitche, it says (WW) fglrx: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:7:0:1) found
[03:29] <Megaqwerty> jrib: my question was stated above
[03:29] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, run "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" Look for a Section "Device" and tell us what driver it is using
[03:29] <wastrel> Alakazamz0r:  someone already linked a pic of the stickers :]

[03:29] <MusicKing> that's if I can boot it up, it tends to not boot up (well it does, but no video on install)
[03:29] <Megaqwerty> jrib: just a second
[03:30] <Alakazamz0r> aah, i see.
[03:30] <Alakazamz0r> hehe
[03:30] <Alakazamz0r> pretty cool eh?

[03:32] <jrib> Megaqwerty: does nothing happen when you press alt-f12?
[03:32] <tgelter> Flannel: thanks, but I've tried that tutorial (among others) and can't get it fixed
[03:32] <byteshack> seems that I have lost my sound when upgrading to edgy
[03:32] <byteshack> where can I start looking?
[03:33] <Megaqwerty> jrib: it does, (funny, it didn't before) but the tray icon still doesn't appear.
[03:33] <byteshack> i.e. my "flash" sound for youtube does not work any longer
[03:33] <ianmacgregor> byteshack: Did you open Volume Control and slide PCM all the way up?
[03:33] <mikeymike-linux> ok so.... i tried ssh'ing to my friend after they reinstalled to edgy.... and im getting an RSA key differential.... how do i fix? remove the key?
[03:33] <jrib> Megaqwerty: it doesn't for me either, i have to add it to the panel.  Does it refuse to let you add it?
[03:33] <Lathiat> mikeymike-linux: remove the line from .ssh/known_hosts
[03:33] <Megaqwerty> jrib: how do I do that?
[03:33] <Lathiat> mikeymike-linux: it tells you which line

[03:35] <MusicKing> will radeon fix it

[03:35] <sasuhasas> anyone with ubuntu edgy and mercury?
[03:35] <fiXXXerMet> OK.  Live CD boots up (1024 x 768 @ 32), I get to the desktop, but I can't see the mouse.  I can click things, but I can't see the physical pointer.

[03:36] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, it should
[03:36] <ianmacgregor> !rar > Borat
[03:36] <MusicKing> ok, ill give it a shot
[03:36] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, if you want to run the binrary you could type "dpkg -l | grep fglrx" to see if you have the fglrx driver installed, you could also try "fglrx" as the driver
[03:36] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, although it has some problems with the 9600 card

[03:40] <wastrel> hwclock to change the hardware clock , date to change system time
[03:40] <factotum> thanks much
[03:40] <Gevaudan82> factotum: right click the clcok and adjust the time...note that there is  bug in edgy which has been reported so it might crash on you
[03:41] <Uberriffi1> factotum: 1. check your system bios 2. check hwclock 3. just use a ntp server (see ntpdate)

[03:41] <wastrel> MusicKing:  lspci  | grep ATI
[03:41] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing: it probably isn't a fault of Ubuntu, it probably is that your Xorg config needs to be updated
[03:41] <kodat> hey anyone with beryl know which option in manager makes panel icons popout like mac?
[03:42] <byteshack> netstar: is that the "Enable software sound mixing" that you speak about?

[03:44] <mwright1> hi, I have a prolem
[03:44] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, there is a chance your Xorg config is just wrong or has an error in it.
[03:44] <Uberriffi1> MusicKing, if thats the case you'll have to eidt it, and not just rely on "ubuntu updates"
[03:44] <babo> So I'm making calls with my sipphone. It connects fine, and I can hear the other person speak, but they can't hear me speak ...
[03:44] <Quinn_Storm> I've searched through the forums but I'm having trouble.  I'm using the bcm43xx driver for my network card, and while the connection works and is stable, it's far too slow.  Anyone have any clue why this might be happening?
[03:44] <Flats> Quick question. I have a Ubuntu box and 2 winXP machines. If I setup my printer on the Ubuntu box ( I suppose via CUPS interface ), how difficult would it be to allow the windows PC's to print to it?
[03:44] <mitrovarr> Hey everyone, I just upgraded my computer and I'm wondering; which works better, migrating a ubuntu install to another, larger partition, or trying to enlarge the partition on the drive it's on?

[03:45] <Uberriffi1> mitrovarr: I would just istall on the new drive and then copy files over from the old drive (or partition). But if you have alot of config stuff you don't wnat to have to redo, then just try to resize

[03:46] <mwright1> it gets to dh_clean: cannot read debian/control; No such file or directory
[03:46] <mwright1> anyone know what this means?
[03:47] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: umm i can do the kernel install, done alot of them on this machine, i'm just new to ubuntu so i don't know the package names, and i have some semi broken hardware as for the network thing....
[03:47] <Uberriffi1> mitrovarr: then just resize your current parition if you have available disk space.
[03:47] <MusicKing> is there an easy way to get the WPC54G (wireless card) working without trying to mess with ndis?
[03:48] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: then you want linux-source packages
[03:48] <mitrovarr> Uberriffil:  how safe is that?  Is that a pretty reliable function or something I absolutely, positivily want to back up before? and does my filesystem (ext3fs) change it?
[03:48] <mwright1> can anyone help me with edgy ndiswrapper
[03:48] <byteshack> anyone with a good link with doco on how to get flash sound in edgy?
[03:48] <mwright1> I got this working in dapper, not it's died in edgy

[03:49] <LMelior> quick question: where is the path environment variable stored?  I read it was in /etc/profile, but on 6.06 it doesn't seem to be in there.
[03:49] <Uberriffi1> mitrovarr: yeah parted is pretty reliable
[03:49] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: nope

[03:50] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: you could just spend 10 bucks and buy a new NIC that is well supported =)
[03:50] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: it's a lappy, they want ~500USD for a new main board
[03:50] <Uberriffi1> shadowhywind: Alt-F2   then type "konsole" then in the black window type "ps ax | grep cupsd"
[03:50] <kitche> Uberriffi1: ummt hat's for cups not cpu
[03:50] <nasragiel> how can i change this ugly buttons in nautilus to a inputfield like in firefox the url input? ive seen that this is possible, but how?
[03:50] <mwright1> how do I compile ndiswrapper
[03:50] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: ah... you could buy a usb nic =)
[03:51] <cynyr> coastermaster: you'll need a RW ntfs driver, like ntfs-3g for FUSE or captive NTFS
[03:51] <kitche> shadowhywind: cat /proc/cpuinfo in a terminal
[03:51] <coastermaster> thanks....time to head to google
[03:51] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: usb1.1... and it's a 5 year old box and my back up lappy not worth the money...
[03:51] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: you can get a usb 1.1 nic for under $35 bucks i bet
[03:51] <bimberi> LMelior: /etc/environment has it.  I'm not certain that's the right place but give it a try.
[03:51] <mitrovarr> shadowhywind: gnome-system-monitor will show the utilization of each CPU, if you have more than one working
[03:51] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: i know, i have one =)
[03:52] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: paypal me $33? :P
[03:52] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: heh ,  r u that broke?
[03:52] <dcraven> mwright1, assuming you have version 1.1 installed, try 1.8 (both in the repo). That worked for me.
[03:52] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: is there a package i need to install to get GCC/ld/etc?
[03:52] <shadowhywind> i am running KDE, the kde sysguard only shows one CPU

[03:54] <Uberriffi1> tom47 i had issues upgradin to Edgy from Dapper with python packages. I had to edit the post install files
[03:55] <shadowhywind> i just installed gnome-system-monitor, and its only showing one CPU
[03:55] <tom47> Uberrifil yes got it ..... not a dapper edgy upgrade just a fresh dapper install with the immediate (some 174/178 now) :) packages
[03:55] <Uberriffi1> cynyr: ah
[03:55] <slide> I cant seem to boot my ubuntu install (6.06), it goes through grub and says Loading kernel and everything, but just stays there and doesnt do anything
[03:55] <tom47> Uberiffil its python2.4-minimal
[03:55] <kitche> cynyr: do you mean in the console or X?
[03:55] <gradin> hi all
[03:55] <cynyr> Uberriffi1: it's a mobility rage p/m...
[03:55] <cynyr> kitche: DRI support in X
[03:56] <cynyr> kitche: it needs the mach64 drier
[03:56] <cynyr> driver
[03:56] <Uberriffi1> tom47, can you paste the error to http://www.rafb.net/paste/ and give us a link
[03:56] <msomers> question: I'm trying to install MythTV on 6.10 using these instructions (http://parker1.co.uk/mythtv_ubuntu.php) and it tells me to check if my capture card is supported, so i assume the command is "grep DVB /var/log/messages", but nothing happens, in the instructions it is right under the "Kernel Modules" heading
[03:56] <mwright1> ndis
[03:57] <vbgunz> how do I trouble shoot a process or service that always has the zombie status?
[03:57] <Uberriffi1> vbgunz:  is it vmare?
[03:57] <Uberriffi1> *vmare
[03:57] <Uberriffi1> *vmware
[03:57] <xerophyte> does anybody know any good svn gui client ??
[03:58] <vbgunz> something is obviously wrong, netstat is always a zombie...
[03:58] <cynyr> kitche: it's a PITA card to get DRI support on, the X driver has to have the falg for the insecure drivers, and the kernel needs specific support, it's a crappy 8mb PCI card
[03:58] <msomers> ^^^anyone get a chance to see my question above?
[03:58] <sevtastic> gnome-terminal works well
[03:58] <vbgunz> Uberriffi1: maybe vmware is causing it?
[03:58] <Uberriffi1> xerophyte: konsole =)
[03:58] <sevtastic> of course the gui client is cli
[03:58] <sevtastic> :)
[03:58] <fiXXXerMet> OK.  Live CD boots up (1024 x 768 @ 32), I get to the desktop, but I can't see the mouse.  I can click things, but I can't see the physical pointer.  ANy ideas?
[03:58] <Uberriffi1> sevtastic: emacs works well to
[03:58] <xerophyte> Uberriffi1, i have mentioned GUI :) answer is wrong
[03:58] <sevtastic> yeah but he asked for a gui one
[03:58] <sevtastic> :)
[03:58] <Uberriffi1> heh, emacs loads in X =)
[03:58] <sevtastic> so does vi for that matter
[03:59] <gradin> hey guys i got a problem, i need to change my apache2 webserver to stop showing a list of the files in the directory and go to a default webpage
[03:59] <xerophyte> Seveas, cli??
=== voosuz_ is now known as voosuz
[03:59] <gradin> any ideals
[03:59] <Uberriffi1> vbgunz: probably not, usually vmware just defuncts itself
[03:59] <xerophyte> sevtastic, cli ??
[03:59] <sevtastic> gradin, easiest way is to echo "Options -Indexes >> .htaccess" in your web root
[03:59] <sevtastic> er
[03:59] <sevtastic> echo "Options -Indexes" >> .htaccess
[04:00] <sevtastic> xerophyte, command-line interface. i was pulling your leg and being a smartass
[04:00] <cynyr> just as a thought.... why didn't linux-sources install build-essential and ncurses, and anything else it is gonna need?
[04:00] <vbgunz> Uber: thanks!
[04:00] <gradin> sevtastic where is the .htaccess stored by default?
[04:00] <vbgunz> anybody know how to find out what is causing a process to zombie?
[04:00] <msomers> is the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR 150 automatically supported in 6.10?
[04:00] <sevtastic> same directory where your web content is stored
[04:00] <sevtastic> you create one if it isn't there
[04:00] <sevtastic> and cmod 644 it
[04:00] <sevtastic> chmod
[04:00] <bimberi> cynyr: you might just be wanting to browse the source code :)
[04:00] <coastermaster> how can I make one of my launchers in the top panel open an application on a specific workspace?
[04:00] <dm1tri> They noem it of gdesklest is gdesklest same? I am not obtaining to find the site to make download.
[04:01] <sevtastic> i'm not sure where apache'd be putting it. maybe /var/www/html?
[04:01] <vbgunz> coastermaster: learn devilspie
[04:01] <sevtastic> also depends on how you have your vhosts set up
[04:01] <cynyr> bimberi: seems unlikly but i'll give that to you, then why didn't it prompt for if i want the supporting apps?
[04:01] <Gevaudan82> Hello all...has anyone else had problems mounting windows drives from ubuntu? I've tried and it mounts successfully but eventually times out and want list the windows contents...any clues?
[04:01] <sevtastic> basically run that command in the same folder you serve your content out of and you should be good
[04:01] <gradin> Seveas its not in /var/www
[04:02] <Kalist00> how can i see what user Apache is running under?
[04:02] <Gevaudan82> Kalist00: it's probally running under www-data
[04:02] <Kalist00> top
[04:02] <sanmarcos> Kalist00: man ps
[04:02] <sevtastic> man ftw
[04:02] <sevtastic> :)
[04:02] <sanmarcos> yeah screw info
[04:03] <bimberi> cynyr: prompt? apt-get? because it doesn't prompt for recommends packages
[04:03] <gradin> well that didn't work :P
[04:03] <cynyr> bimberi: i was using synaptic... not apt-get...
[04:03] <sevtastic> gradin, you running a local install or is this a server you have somewhere
[04:03] <gradin> local
[04:03] <bimberi> cynyr: synaptic doesn't either
[04:03] <Coir> can someone help me setup a jabber server? I installed jabber-common and I'm not sure where to go from there.
[04:04] <sevtastic> how do you access your files? http://host.name/~username?
[04:04] <cynyr> bimberi: just seems kindda dumb to install the sources and then make menuconfig errors out...
[04:04] <cynyr> with "curses.h no such file or directory"
[04:04] <gradin> sevtastic http://domain is how i'd like to beable to access the webpage
[04:05] <sevtastic> ok do this
[04:05] <sevtastic> look at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
[04:05] <sevtastic> and see if it has a path set in there
[04:05] <msomers> this is a really dumb question, but i just can't find the answer - how do i check which kernel I have? I installed the latest 6.10
[04:05] <bimberi> how is it supposed to know you're going to use 'make menuconfig' when there's also xconfig and just config (iirc)
[04:05] <mikedoty> Entering sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg starts a sort of reset process, but after about 15 questions, when it's asking me monitor quesitons, it fails with the message, "overwriting possibly-customised configuration file, backup in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.20061030205942."  :(
[04:05] <sevtastic> i don't know apache on ubuntu

[04:05] <ubotu> babo: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:05] <Gevaudan82> apache on ubuntu is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ...also check /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

[04:07] <sevtastic> ok
[04:08] <shawty> jrib: vmware workstation
[04:08] <jrib> shawty: ah, then I can't speak to that.  vmware player worked fine from the repos though
[04:08] <sevtastic> gradin, please post the contents at http://pastebin.com and link me to it
[04:09] <dcraven> mikedoty, that's not a failure, it's a message telling you that dpkg has saved your old config file and replaced it with a new one. That long number is the current date and time. It's tacked onto the filename of the old file so that you know when it was replaced.
[04:09] <shawty> jrib: ok other ppl have also had issues so im going to try this patch ... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMware#head-9973a76766d2a1a45c0da13567ce73c227904cbf

[04:22] <mike_> weird
[04:22] <sevtastic> that may be a good thing mike
[04:22] <sevtastic> ;)
[04:22] <mike_> no it isn't I am good
[04:22] <mike_> anybody ran into that before in ubuntu
[04:22] <sevtastic> are you doing sudo/
[04:22] <sevtastic> or rather, what are you trying to do?
[04:22] <mike_> nope
[04:22] <MrU_> Does anyone know how to make a USB hard drive boot up one of several ISO images?
[04:23] <GregB> anyone having issues with java 5 release 9 going into an endless sound loop?
[04:23] <mike_> sudo did work though
[04:23] <dabaR> mike_: lots of people since root is disabled by default, as they say...
[04:23] <mike_> how do I enable root then
[04:23] <dabaR> mike_: I could run into it right now...try your password in the gui
[04:23] <jrib> ubotu: tell mike_ about root
[04:23] <sevtastic> sudo passwd root
[04:23] <sevtastic> enter your user password
[04:23] <sevtastic> then type your new root passwod
[04:23] <sevtastic> then do su
[04:23] <sevtastic> type the new root pass
[04:23] <sevtastic> viola
[04:24] <dabaR> viola, cello...
[04:24] <nomasteryoda> !enter
[04:24] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[04:24] <dabaR> it can also be fun!!11
[04:24] <mike_> ya i did all of that but if I run a program in the gui the prompt comes up but won't take my root password only in cle
[04:24] <sevtastic> gradin: you all squared away dude?
[04:24] <mike_> cli
[04:24] <gradin> sevtastic its still pointing to a listing of whats in the directory
[04:25] <sevtastic> ok
[04:25] <gradin> wait there it goes
[04:25] <dabaR> mike_: tried your pwd?
[04:25] <gradin> thanks
[04:25] <sevtastic> cool!
[04:25] <mike_> dabaR, ?
[04:25] <tritium> sevtastic: please don't recommend setting a root password over using sudo
[04:25] <MrU_> Does anyone know how to make a USB hard drive boot up one of several ISO images?
[04:25] <jrib> mike_: try your user password
[04:25] <gradin> sevtastic wanna do an external test for me?
[04:25] <sevtastic> tritium: the guy said he knew what he was doing. anybody who reads a man page can figure that out
[04:26] <mikedoty> I can get somewhat into ubuntu again, and now have 1024x768 like I wanted ... but I have to use the Failsafe session in order to get to the desktop...
[04:26] <msomers> i'm installing mythtv, and I just ran the "sudo apt-get install mythtv mythtv-themes" command, and at the end i noticed this error: "Starting MythTV server: mythbackendSession management error: Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed"
[04:26] <dabaR> sevtastic: obey the tritium ...
[04:26] <Astroo> hello people ... I am planning to move to ubuntu 6.10 from windows xp. is anyone here that would answer me some basic questions?
[04:26] <tritium> lol
[04:26] <mike_> password doesn't work in gui
[04:26] <jrib> Astroo: sure, just ask
[04:26] <dabaR> !ask
[04:26] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:26] <mikedoty> What should I do to not have to use the failsafe?  I can hardly really even tell what the problem is
[04:26] <sevtastic> oh i'm not being disrespectful. just saying
[04:26] <GregB> anyone having issues with java 5 release 9 going into an endless sound loop?
[04:26] <navreet> hi, anyone here know how I can use ekiga to talk to someone with iChat?
[04:26] <rm_you> anyone know why when I set xorg to use the radeon driver, it says "no such module", but I can modprobe radeon and do lsmod and see that it loaded correctly >_> (i'm in eft)
[04:26] <mike_> dabaR, password doesn't work in gui
[04:26] <Flannel> mike_: your sudo password will work in the GUI with sudo
[04:26] <tritium> sevtastic: that's cool, if he wanted it.  In general, though, we prefer sudo.  :)
[04:26] <dabaR> sevtastic: of course you are not being disrespectful, just obey the tritium though...
[04:26] <mike_> I have to sudo?
[04:27] <dabaR> mike_: can you sudo?
[04:27] <jrib> mike_: does 'sudo echo hi' in a terminal accept your password and say "hi"?
[04:27] <mike_> yes in cli dabaR
[04:27] <Astroo> jrib: my first worrie is that u have a widescreen on my laptop (fujitsu siemens amilo pro v2035) ... will it set the 1280x800 resolution?
[04:27] <mike_> yes jrib
[04:27] <fiveiron> so whats a good tut for setting up a VPN server?
[04:27] <cary> Really really easy question: i am having trouble booting from the Live Dapper CD on my Powerbook. Rebooting holding C doesnt seem to be working. Any help?
[04:27] <mike_> but I cannot upgrade packages in the gui because it won't accept my password
[04:27] <dabaR> mike_: then just use sudo for everything, and even gksudo if it is a graphical program, and the admin menu items _will_ acept your password.
[04:27] <jrib> Astroo: I meant just ask the channel, I don't about widescreen sorry
[04:27] <mike_> only in the cli
[04:28] <Astroo> ok
[04:28] <mike_> what a pain dabaR
[04:28] <Flannel> mike_: you use your user password for that, not your root password
[04:28] <mike_> is there not a fix dabaR
[04:28] <mike_> Flannel, is that the way it is supposed to be or is it broken?
[04:28] <cary> anyone? super easy im sure
[04:28] <Astroo> so anyone knows if ubuntu sets the right resolution on widescreen monitors on laptops?
[04:28] <dabaR> mike_: what? for doing exactly what program ran how accept the root password?
[04:28] <tritium> Astroo: it does
[04:29] <Flannel> mike_: yes, that's the way it's supposed to be.  Ubuntu does not use the root password, it uses sudo.
[04:29] <Astroo> tritium thank you
[04:29] <mike_> dabaR, add and remove programs as a user
[04:29] <mike_> it pulls up a password prompt
[04:29] <mike_> won't accept my root password
[04:29] <sevtastic> so put your user password
[04:29] <punkforpez> cary have you tried holding option down during boot?
[04:29] <sevtastic> not the root one
[04:29] <dabaR> mike_: what you open that through the gnome panel menu? and it accepts your user password over your root password and you would like to change that?
[04:29] <Flannel> mike_: use your USER password, NOT your root password.
[04:29] <cary> punkforpez, i shall try that. thank you
[04:30] <mike_> Flannel, user password isn't accepted either
[04:30] <godtvisken> How do I flush my ARP cache?
[04:30] <Astroo> now if someone tells me if there is a good alternative for macromedia dreamweaver (including file browser, integrated ftp client and tabs for opened documents, maybe some autocompleting)

[04:31] <sydhart> hi all. I'll try asking my question again. I'm making a custom 6.10 live CD. Where do I change the default resolution choices which top at at a conservative 1024x768 @60Hz (/etc/X/xorg.conf is autogenerated, and changing the /usr/share/xresprobe/xorg.conf template has no effect)
[04:31] <babo> does anyone know a good voip/sip channel ?
[04:31] <sevtastic> yeah, that's how ubuntu works
[04:31] <MrBond82> Hi, I screwed up my grub bootloader. I am running my ubuntu live cd and have mounted my fileystem with the menu.lst file... how do I "install" grub back onto the MBR ?
[04:31] <sevtastic> it's kinda like os x in that respect
[04:31] <dabaR> mike_: you are the admin user, so it asks for your password if you try to do something admin.
[04:31] <jrib> mike_: ubuntu uses sudo it is supposed to be that way.  There is no need to have a root password
[04:31] <mike_> weird
[04:31] <Greg_B> anyone having issues with java 5 release 9 going into an endless sound loop?  For example on pogo.com sounds repeat over and over until I close FF

[04:33] <sevtastic> mike_:  if you know debian you should be more or less at home with ubuntu
[04:33] <haldrik> dabaR: yes
[04:33] <haldrik> dabaR: like debian
[04:33] <ketsugi> Yay, PLF is back
[04:33] <Greg_B> Can anyone help...I'm having issues with java 5 release 9 going into an endless sound loop.
[04:34] <mike_> sevtastic, I am a slackware
[04:34] <mike_> guy
[04:34] <sevtastic> apt is your friend now
[04:34] <Astroo> VigoFuse ok thanks
[04:35] <rm_you> anyone here using edgy eft and have the open source radeon drivers working? or anyone else having issues?
[04:35] <VigoFuse> My pleasure, I allways liked Paul Lutus's stuff, and his attitude
[04:35] <fiveiron> anyone running a VPN?
[04:35] <dabaR> haldrik: there are none that I know of, ask google. This one guy on planet.ubuntu.com released a 0.1 version of some program for that, aptoncd
[04:35] <haldrik> Where I can find extra DVD's of ubuntu, with extra package like Debian DVD's (3 DVD)
[04:36] <dabaR> rm_you: Maybe the driver name is ati.
[04:36] <haldrik> dabaR: mmm,
[04:36] <bruenig> is there a command I can use to determine my IP?
[04:36] <monofonik> hey
[04:36] <Flannel> haldrik: they don't exist.  You can get one DVD of ubuntu, but the extra repository ones don't exist.
[04:36] <MrBond82> how do I fix Grub ?
[04:36] <fiveiron> haldrik, i don't believe Ubuntu does that..... if you need more packages just use Synaptic
[04:36] <Flannel> bruenig: you on a NAT?
[04:36] <rm_you> dabaR: nope, tried :( plus, if i do modprobe radeon, it works, and i can see the module loaded with lsmod >_>
[04:36] <monofonik> should i disable journalling on my hard drive before i resize my boot partition on my powerbook?
[04:36] <haldrik> fiveiron: but I dont have internet connection
[04:37] <dabaR> rm_you: what instr. were you following?
[04:37] <bruenig> Flannel, no
[04:37] <dusk> !ati
[04:37] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:37] <rm_you> dabaR: erm... something on ubuntuforums
[04:37] <sevtastic> omg the new ubuntu desktop dc is unbelievable simple like

[04:38] <nexl> hi all
[04:38] <dabaR> rm_you: they have instructions there though...for the binary driver
[04:39] <rm_you> dabaR: fglrx works :( but isnt what I need....
[04:39] <cary> so, anyone, i just restarted my powerbook holding option and the dapper live disc was not a boot option. any ideas? i cant find anything online
[04:39] <sevtastic> HeathenDan: lost+found is for ext3 partitions
[04:39] <monofonik> cary: you dont hold option
[04:39] <sevtastic> if you crash, it uses it to fsck
[04:39] <monofonik> you hold c
[04:39] <monofonik> right after the chime, before the grey apple
[04:39] <nexl> I have a small home server no X, I need sug. for a mail reader, besides mailx
[04:39] <cary> monofonik i tried holding C and it just boots to the main HD
[04:40] <HeathenDan> i see, neat
[04:40] <monofonik> which pbook model?
[04:40] <dabaR> what about the apple key?
[04:40] <cary> monofonik 1.5 ghz 15"
[04:40] <monofonik> same as mine
[04:40] <sevtastic> cary: you gotta hold down c right as you turn the thing on
[04:40] <monofonik> sd or combo?
[04:40] <cary> sd
[04:40] <monofonik> ahhhh
[04:40] <monofonik> i'm combo
[04:40] <cary> i installed a few versions back
[04:40] <dabaR> haha
[04:40] <dabaR> that convo was off
[04:41] <sevtastic> i'm on a MBP with sd and holding c does the trick
[04:41] <monofonik> yeah, hold down c dude
[04:41] <sevtastic> it's universal
[04:41] <bruenig> what is the name of the text browser that comes installed on ubuntu?
[04:41] <cary> i was dual booting osx and whatever was out then
[04:41] <monofonik> always works for me
[04:41] <sevtastic> the emac at work takes it
[04:41] <monofonik> hey sev
[04:41] <monofonik> did you install ubuntu?
[04:41] <Spawn> Hello everyone.. can soneone tell me how can I enable a user from root?  I can't seemed to log in anymore.  It telles me that the user has being desable by administrator
[04:41] <wastrel> bruenig:  w3m

[04:41] <sevtastic> not on my mac no
[04:41] <monofonik> ahhh shit.
[04:41] <bruenig> wasabi, ah thinks, I was trying w3c
[04:41] <monofonik> i need a question answered.

[04:42] <mwright1> i'm having serious trouble with the wlan0
[04:42] <dabaR> Spawn: tried adduser?
[04:42] <cary> ill try C again. is it possible that ive messed up the burn going straight from the .iso into Toast? its what worked before but i know ive messed these thigns up before
[04:42] <sevtastic> nexl: try pine?
[04:42] <mwright1> I am trying iwconfig wlan0 essid sitename  then iwconfig wlan0 key blahblah in hex
[04:42] <monofonik> do i need to disable journalling before resizing my boot partition to create room to install ubuntu?
[04:42] <mwright1> then dhclient wlan0  and I can't get it to come up -- am I missing something?
[04:42] <sevtastic> no
[04:42] <sevtastic> you just use diskutil
[04:42] <cary> monofonik, sevtastic, trying C again. fyi. thanks too
[04:43] <nexl> sevtastic: light on ressources? it's a P2
[04:43] <monofonik> diskutil?
[04:43] <monofonik> in tiger?
[04:43] <sevtastic> nexl, pine dates back like 15 years
[04:43] <sevtastic> it'll run
[04:43] <sevtastic> monofonik: hold
[04:44] <nexl> sevtastic: thanks
[04:44] <wastrel> mmm pine :] 
[04:44] <Flannel> nexl, pine isn't in ubuntu, mutt is a Free alternate that is though
[04:44] <wastrel> <3 mutt
[04:45] <mikedoty> Where is the .xsession-errors file located?
[04:45] <Spawn> Can someone tell me how can I enable a user from root?
[04:45] <Flannel> mikedoty: /var/log would be a good place to look
[04:45] <nexl> Flannel: thanks was just trying to find it in apt.
[04:45] <babo> Guys, does TestYourVoIP.com service work for anyone ?
[04:45] <cary> monofonik, sevtastic, hold C makes the drive spin up like it wants to boot but then just, skips it and goes to my main hd
[04:45] <cary> holding*
[04:46] <wastrel> sounds like it's not a bootable CD?
[04:46] <sevtastic> cary you sure the disk is bootable?
[04:46] <troopa> Does Ubuntu have fair security by default? I can't seem to find any detailed specifications regarding Ubuntu's default security.
[04:46] <wastrel> or not a PPC cd
[04:46] <monofonik> you sure you downloaded the powerpc ver?
[04:46] <wastrel> troopa:  there's no services running by default
[04:46] <bruenig> so I take it nobody knows how I can go about finding out my ip via command line
[04:47] <wastrel> bruenig:  ifconfig
[04:47] <sevtastic> bruenig: ifconfig should do it
[04:47] <troopa> wastrel: What is the default firewall, and does it have strong rules?
[04:47] <troopa> bruenig: Try  ifconfig -a
[04:47] <wastrel> troopa:  there's no firewall by default - you can set one up with firestarter.  i don't use a fw so dunno much more.
[04:47] <bruenig> ah there it is
[04:47] <ianmacgregor> wastrel: There is a firewall by default, it's called iptables.
[04:47] <cam> is there a howto for using 2 monitors with one graphic card ?
[04:47] <cary> sevtastic, im pretty sure i downloaed the right [read: bootable]  version, and monofonik, im almost certain i got the ppc. do either of you know, definitively, the proper link to get the right iso? and further, how to 100% make sure the disk is bootable?
[04:47] <sevtastic> monofonik: try: sudo diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 60G
[04:47] <nexl> bruenig: what about ifconfg?
[04:47] <sevtastic> or whatever size you want to resize to
[04:48] <dfcarney> cam: google for "dual head" display
[04:48] <sevtastic> don't hold me to that though i could keep looking
[04:48] <sevtastic> i know i've done it before
[04:48] <Flannel> !xinerama | cam
[04:48] <ubotu> cam: xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[04:48] <wastrel> ianmacgregor:  my mistake
[04:48] <troopa> Alright, I am a bit confused. So IPTables is the default firewall packaged with Ubuntu?
[04:48] <ianmacgregor> yes
[04:48] <ArrenLex> Am I the only one who can't use the radio buttons under the textbox on http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=bash&searchon=names&subword=1&version=edgy&release=all in Firefox? The Package names, Descriptions, Source packages ones?
[04:48] <cary> the ISO on my desktop is ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-powerpc.iso
[04:48] <cam> tx
[04:48] <ianmacgregor> troopa: And Firestarter is a gui to set up iptables
[04:48] <Flannel> cary: and you burnt it as an ISO? or just an iso file on the CD?
[04:49] <troopa> Yeah. I just wasn't aware if it was enabled by default.
[04:49] <KurtKraut> How can I avoid OpenSSH server running each time I turn on my PC ?
[04:49] <troopa> My workstations are protected by my OpenBSD box that I turned into a firewall/router. So it isn't the biggest issue.
[04:49] <cary> flannel as an iso. when i look at the cd i see foldres, not an iso file to mount
[04:49] <dfcarney> KurtKraut: uninstall openssl :)
[04:49] <dfcarney> KurtKraut: seriously, you can edit the list of scripts in /etc/init.d
[04:49] <dusk> what kernel should I be running
[04:50] <amicrawle> how do i copy a file to usr/share  from my home dir?
[04:50] <dusk> i installed alternate install
[04:50] <Flannel> cary: and youve got a PPC mac?  and your boot order is set correctly? sounds like a bad burn... I guess.  if nothing else is wrong
[04:50] <ArrenLex> Hallo? Can someone confirm or deny my problem?
[04:50] <troopa> Other places people enable programs after boot are in the rc.conf
[04:50] <myke> hello
[04:50] <dabaR> ArrenLex: I deny it
[04:50] <ianmacgregor> amicrawle: sudo cp /path/source-file /path/target/dir
[04:50] <ArrenLex> dabaR: It works for you in Firefox?
[04:50] <myke> i had my sound working,, but when i tried to install Mythtv i can no longer play mp3s
[04:51] <macri> Hello can somebody help me how to access Cisco Console using ubuntu ( using USB seraial converter)
[04:51] <amicrawle> so sudo cp /home/balbal/tos14 /usr/share/hatari?
[04:51] <cary> flannel, how doyou mean my boot order is right. ubuntu is not installed, im just wanting to run the live cd. so there is no bootstrap to haggle with to my knowledge. when i boot wtih C it spins up the skips it. when i boot with option it looks at the disk and doesnt list it as a boot option
[04:51] <vader> !ati
[04:51] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:51] <troopa> ian: Does Ubuntu use any third-party patches like GRSec, or policy-based tools like SELinux?
[04:51] <ianmacgregor> troopa: I don't know
[04:52] <nn> what kind of kernel (from ubuntu's kernel selections on 6.06/dapper) should i use for a Via C3 Nemiah?
[04:52] <BDerwent> can anyone lead me to directions to salvage a buggy edgy upgrade?
[04:52] <KurtKraut> dfcarney, I cant remeber precisely, but OpenSSH was previously listed in the 'Services' item in the Gnome administration. It is not appearing anymore. Is this expected to happen ?
[04:52] <regeya> BDerwent: yfi...
[04:52] <regeya> !development
[04:52] <MusicKing> Short of my wireless and XGL I would say it's up and running
[04:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about development - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:52] <dabaR> ArrenLex: no, I confirm it actually
[04:52] <macri> sorry for asking again..  can anybody throw some light on USB Serial + CIsco Console access
[04:52] <dfcarney> KurtKraut: i don't know.  I use Ubuntu nowadays, but I've got a Debian background.  Often, I just go "back to basics" when debugging problems like that.
[04:53] <troopa> Alright, fair enough. Here is my last question: Does Ubuntu offer better multimedia functionality by default compared to other distributions?
[04:53] <ArrenLex> dabaR: good to hear! Whose bug is this? Firefox's or ubuntu's?
[04:53] <dabaR> ArrenLex: post to ubuntu...check view source as well.
[04:53] <dfcarney> troopa: It's better maintained, I think.  However, they're not allowed to ship with various codecs, etc...
[04:53] <wastrel> troopa:  you'll have to install proprietary multimedia codecs, they don't come by default because they're not FOSS
[04:54] <sevtastic> google for easyubuntu
[04:54] <sevtastic> should be all the codecs in one pack
[04:54] <troopa> Ahh, alright. Thanks for the tip.
[04:54] <Flannel> ArrenLex: works in stock FF1.5
[04:54] <chris86wm> hey guys
[04:54] <BDerwent> the upgrade corrupted firefox related libraries
[04:54] <mikedoty> I can't find the error file anywhere ... I want to provide an error message, but I can't find anywhere to copy/paste it from
[04:54] <Spawn> Can someone tell me how can I enable a user from root?
[04:54] <ianmacgregor> troopa: I feel it would be best for you to learn how to install those things yourself. That way you are better equipped to fix things when they break.
[04:54] <chris86wm> does anyone know of a good pdf reader besides acroread?
[04:55] <regeya> seriously it doesn't seem possible that edgy could be out yet :-}  I should upgrade as well.
[04:55] <dfcarney> Spawn: what do you mean?
[04:55] <dcraven> chris86wm, evince
[04:55] <ArrenLex> chris: kpdf for kde, evince for gnome. They both render everything perfectly for me.
[04:55] <Flannel> !pdf | chris86wm
[04:55] <ubotu> chris86wm: pdf is the Portable Document Format created by Adobe; viewable in GNU/Linux with xpdf/kpdf/gpdf, evince and also adobe reader (free download, but closed source)
[04:55] <mikedoty> When I try to log on with anything besides the failsafe session, it says "Changes are complete" (I had run that dpkg routine), then it says it can't start this session
[04:55] <chris86wm> dcraven, i have heard that evince is slow
[04:55] <dcraven> chris86wm, k
[04:55] <Spawn> dfcarney I can't log in using normal user. I can only log in using root now.  It tells me that the user has being disable by administrator
[04:55] <ArrenLex> chris86: lies, damned lies.
[04:55] <chris86wm> lol
[04:56] <chris86wm> which is better evince or gpdf?
[04:56] <dcraven> chris86wm, evince
[04:56] <Pelo> anyone know how to auto login ? when booting ubu ?
[04:56] <regeya> so what happens after Zesty Zebra, anyway ;-D
[04:56] <dcraven> chris86wm, you could always try it, and get rid of it if you don't like it.
[04:56] <chris86wm> dcraven i will check it out now, thanks man
[04:57] <Flannel> Spawn: try passwd -u [your username] 
[04:57] <dfcarney> Spawn: as root you can use 'passwd' to change users' passwords.  That may fix things up....
[04:57] <dabaR> Pelo: it is in the login window app in System>Admin
[04:57] <Pelo> regeya, they go into greek letters
[04:57] <dcraven> chris86wm, if you are using GNOME, you already have it.
[04:57] <Spawn> ok
[04:57] <dfcarney> Spawn: type 'man passwd' for details
[04:57] <dfcarney> Spawn: out of curiosity, how did your account get 'disabled' ?
[04:57] <chris86wm> dcraven, i just noticed that, lol. guess i will use this one
[04:57] <chris86wm> thanks for the help
[04:58] <UKMatt> if i'm having issues connecting my camera to my computer is there anything I should try
[04:58] <dcraven> chris86wm, np
[04:58] <Spawn> well I was surfing in root..
[04:58] <dabaR> regeya: we stop using stupid animal names
[04:58] <Pelo> dabaR,  thanks
[04:58] <dfcarney> Spawn: and you're running Ubuntu?
[04:58] <dabaR> finally!
[04:58] <Spawn> yeah... on my laptop.. Im connected here with my PC
[04:59] <Spawn> I don't wanna use the internet using root
[04:59] <dfcarney> Spawn: I just want to be clear on this... I didn't think that it was possible to login as the root user because the password was intentionally disabled/hidden.
[04:59] <^V^> Hi, does anyone know what I need to add to /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to allow access to printers from the LAN (without login) ?
[04:59] <Ghost_Printer> !firestarter
[04:59] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:59] <Spawn> well I was playing with the users in the administrator section.. and now i can't log in
[04:59] <nomasteryoda> lol
[05:00] <Pelo> dabaR,  I take it you don'T get thanked a lot ...
[05:00] <bimberi> ^V^: This page describes what's required - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[05:00] <philip> anyone here running compiz/xgl on edgy? compiz starts, i see a blue screen, but everything else segfaults
[05:00] <Xaphoo> does anyone have any experience with ntfs-3g?  Is it risky?
[05:00] <dfcarney> Spawn: but you're right in that you should avoid doing stuff as root whenever possible
[05:00] <philip> when i start xgl alone, i can run xfce4-session w/o problems
[05:00] <mikedoty> Does anyone know how I can log in without using the failsafe session?  How can I regain access to mounted drives?
[05:00] <Spawn> dfcarney I know that i don't know what happend.. but its disable now.
[05:01] <dabaR> Pelo: no, you did not read the conversation
[05:01] <dfcarney> Spawn: well, as Flannel suggested, 'passwd' should solve your problems
[05:01] <Spawn> dfcarney I typed in passwd -spawn (my username) its asking for login shell
[05:01] <Xaphoo> philip, I'm not running compiz/xgl but I'm running nvidia beta/beryl and it's runs perfectly and easily
=== Knoppix__ is now known as Knoppix20980897
[05:01] <Xaphoo> I recommend that route
[05:01] <vanRijn_> re, all
[05:01] <Pelo> dabaR,  I wasn't realy paying attention
[05:01] <dabaR> Pelo: starts with regeya's question about the zesty zebra
[05:01] <vanRijn_> is anyone using alsa 1.0.13 with their powermac?
[05:01] <bimberi> Spawn: no "-", just 'passwd spawn'
[05:01] <dabaR> Pelo: i lag too
[05:02] <rawrness> whats the command for the add/remove program button i kinda deleted it.
[05:02] <vanRijn_> I can't for the  life of me get it to work
[05:02] <bimberi> rawrness: gnome-app-install
[05:02] <rawrness> kk
[05:02] <rawrness> thanks
[05:02] <dfcarney> Spawn: use 'passwd -u', not 'passwd -s'
[05:02] <PreZLaptop> heh, I just received a new mobo I'm going to use for a server
[05:02] <bimberi> np
[05:02] <Spawn> ok
[05:03] <vanRijn_> I get this now:  kernel: snd-powermac no longer handles any machines with a layout-id property in the device-tree, use snd-aoa.
[05:03] <PreZLaptop> Tyan S2927 (Dual Athlon Socket F (2xxx CPU)) ...
[05:03] <^V^> bimberi: I've actually enabled cups to listen on my local network, and a different PC running ubuntu sees the printer. However, when I continue with the installation process it asks for a username/password to connect to the server... how do I allow anonymous acces from the local network?
[05:03] <vanRijn_> but I'll be darned if I can find any docs on how to get snd-aoa working
[05:03] <dfcarney> Spawn: yeah, be careful with putting a '-' before letters -- those are interpreted as switches which cause programs to do different things.
[05:03] <PreZLaptop> I'm impressed by little things, like the mobo has a power and reset button right on-board - plus a POST code display :)
[05:03] <netstar> vanRijn_, it should just work out of the box
[05:03] <MrU_> Does anyone know how to make a USB hard drive boot up one of several ISO images?
[05:03] <Tim90> i dont have any of these files  /home/timo900/.freevo
[05:03] <Tim90>   /etc/freevo
[05:03] <Tim90>   /usr/local/etc/freevo
[05:03] <philip> Xaphoo: how?
[05:03] <bimberi> ^V^: sorry, that i don't know :|
[05:04] <vanRijn_> netstar: alsa 1.0.13?
[05:04] <dabaR> Tim90: cool, me neither.
[05:04] <philip> Xaphoo: where do i get beryl for edgy and how do i start it properly?
[05:04] <Tim90> i installed it thou
[05:04] <mikedoty> I understand I'm asking poor questions here, but I simply don't understand what I'm supposed to do.  Can't anyone help me?
[05:04] <dfcarney> MrU_: you'll need to install a bootloader, like LILO, Grub, or syslinux
[05:04] <netstar> vanRijn_, I would assume so
[05:04] <Spawn> dfcarney ok
[05:04] <Tim90> hey dabar ,hows it going
[05:04] <MrU_> how can u use grub to boot an iso image?
[05:04] <netstar> I'm using snd-aoa now
[05:04] <vanRijn_> netstar: they changed snd-powermac and it looks like they are using snd-aoa now, but there's no hints on how to configure it!
[05:04] <dabaR> philip: #ubuntu-xgl
[05:05] <netstar> It should just work
[05:05] <wastrel> mikedoty:  your system boots but you can't login to gnome?
[05:05] <slacktyro> hi all
[05:05] <netstar> vanRijn_, try removind snd-powermac from /etc/modules and reboot
[05:05] <Tim90> isnt it glx
[05:05] <vanRijn_> netstar: yeah, I'll try that
[05:05] <mikedoty> I can only log in with the failsafe
[05:05] <dfcarney> MrU_: do you like reading docs? :)  Seriously, it takes a little reading on the web...but it's pretty straight forward.
[05:05] <slacktyro> i installed the jre through apt-get
[05:05] <mikedoty> Otherwise it says that it cannot load the session and it kicks me back out to the login
[05:05] <Xaphoo> philip: hold on, let me find the good howto that I used
[05:05] <vanRijn_> netstar: are you using 1.0.13?
[05:05] <Xaphoo> philip: you must have an nvidia card
[05:05] <netstar> I've used all variants
[05:05] <slacktyro> but the mozilla firefox isn't recognizing that
[05:05] <slacktyro> what should i do
[05:05] <slacktyro> ?
[05:06] <netstar> Before it was even merged into ALSA
[05:06] <vanRijn_> netstar: yes, but are you using 1.0.13 and a powerbook?
[05:06] <Xaphoo> philip: I used http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851&highlight=beryl  ... it works as advertised
[05:06] <philip> Xaphoo: do i? xgl already runs
[05:06] <netstar> no I'm not, but it should just work, try what I suggested
[05:06] <Tim90> does any one have freevo
[05:06] <Xaphoo> oh
[05:06] <MrU_> Evertthing I can find says I need to copy the iso image to a partition. is there anyway arround that?
[05:06] <Tim90> !freevo
[05:06] <vanRijn_> netstar: k. I'll give it a shot
[05:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about freevo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:06] <Xaphoo> well, I don't know then... this is using the nvidia beta to replace xgl

[05:08] <dabaR> Tim90: the scrolling text will do that...
[05:08] <netstar> yeah the ubuntu default theme is bad

[05:09] <mwright1> anyone hlep me with wireless?
[05:09] <mwright1> please
[05:09] <wastrel> mikedoty:  you're in the gnome login screen?
[05:09] <netstar> mwright1, relax dude
[05:09] <ben_> can anyone here help me repair my edgy upgrade, it must have corrupted some essential libraries because i just about any browser i can try crashes in a few seconds of surfing
[05:09] <Tim90> dabaR: I need to get this thing going ,had to install about 50 stuf to get it to install ,now this cr*p
[05:09] <sethk> mwright1, can you ask a more specific question?
[05:09] <dfcarney> wsjunior: have you tried to mount it from the command line?
[05:09] <regeya> well I suppose I coulda used perl and edited in place but that's for perl fiends
[05:09] <dabaR> mwright1: iwconfig on its own, and sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
[05:10] <wsjunior> dfcarney: how to do it? i just dunno how..
[05:10] <mikedoty> No, I'm in the failsafe session right now ... I should press these keys at the login screen?  I'll see if I can do that without logging out
[05:10] <ArrenLex> ben: what does the console say if you run the browser from console?
[05:10] <wsjunior> dfcarney: the only info that i have is this: [ 6136.347784]  tifm_7xx1: ms card detected in socket 2
[05:10] <JonBoon> hi, all my videos are playing dark in totem and vlc, any ideas why?
[05:10] <dfcarney> wsjunior: what's the device name?  do you know?
[05:10] <slacktyro> dabaR: sry about the dumb question
[05:10] <dfcarney> wsjunior: ah.  what does 'cat /proc/partitions' say?
[05:10] <slacktyro> dabaR: and ty
[05:10] <jadacyrus> Hi, Im havin problems getting my philips webcam to work under edgy
[05:10] <aSt3raL> http://kubuntu.pastebin.ca/230160
[05:10] <mwright1> sethk: all succeeds
[05:10] <Tim90> OK im sick now bye
[05:10] <sethk> ben_, as someone just said, run it in a console.  If that doesn't help, run it under strace and post the output file.
[05:10] <aSt3raL> what dev package is that?
[05:10] <mikedoty> ctrl+alt+f1 at the login screen doesn't do anything either...
[05:11] <wsjunior> dfcarney: memory stick pro duo
[05:11] <macri> what is the software i can use for Cisco Console access in ubuntu... ( Or rather any alternative to minicom)
[05:11] <dfcarney> wsjunior: the first step is to find the device name and partition that you want to mount (for example /dev/sdc1)
[05:11] <netstar> macri people just use minicom I think
[05:11] <alex_mayorga> hi, good afternoon
[05:11] <JonBoon> hi, all my videos are playing dark in totem and vlc, any ideas why?
[05:11] <wsjunior> dfcarney:  252     0   19535008 dm-0
[05:11] <macri> netstar: thanks... do you know any alternative other than minicom
[05:11] <wastrel> mikedoty:  are you in the GUI or command line
[05:11] <mikedoty> GUI
[05:12] <mwright1> sethk: if it shos my network and I can't get a dhclient success
[05:12] <mwright1> what now?
[05:12] <netstar> macri everyone I know uses minicom
[05:12] <alex_mayorga> can anyone provide a silver-bullet to fix a xorg.conf that went belly up
[05:12] <wsjunior> dfcarney: dfcarney there is alsao dm-1 and dm-2
[05:12] <ben_> crap, i can't pastebin what my console says
[05:12] <macri> netstar: Thank you for your help
[05:12] <netstar> np
[05:12] <sethk> mwright1, is the network using keys?
[05:12] <dfcarney> wsjunior: that's from '/proc/partitions' ?
[05:12] <sethk> ben_, you can, actually, if you have the program that does mouse in the console running
[05:12] <wsjunior> dfcarney: yes
[05:13] <dfcarney> wsjunior: ok.  gimme a sec.  i gotta reboot into a 2.6 kernel.  i've been toying around with some stuff in 2.4
[05:13] <mwright1> yes it's using wep
[05:13] <wsjunior> dfcarney: take a look -> http://rafb.net/paste/results/7C7YXE56.html
[05:13] <JonBoon> hi, all my videos are playing dark in totem and vlc, any ideas why?
[05:13] <mwright1> sethk I am entering the key using iwconfig wlan0 key blahblah
[05:13] <jadacyrus> HI, Im having trouble getting my philips webcam to work under edgy...?
[05:14] <sethk> mwright1, any logs on the other side of the connection to look at?  many wireless access points (or ap/router, or whatever) have error logs you can look at when you point a web browser at them
[05:14] <wastrel> mikedoty:  when you boot in non-recovery mode is it GUI or commandline
[05:14] <macri> netstar:  I can access minicom only with root rights (sudo)  is this the correct way... ?
[05:14] <Spawn> dfcarney it work
[05:14] <Spawn> thanks
[05:14] <Spawn> the account is enable now
[05:14] <mwright1> nothign on the log
[05:14] <UKMatt> I have a .avi from my camera that is sideways, what software should I use to rotate it
[05:14] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  well, in a 2.4 system you would first create a mount point (such as /mnt/usb) and then use the mount command to mount the key
[05:14] <JonBoon> it would be really great if someone would at least recognize that i asked a question
[05:15] <mikedoty> zenity: 6642 ... GTK Warning.  That's the start of the error messages when I try to login without using the fail safe session
[05:15] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  for instance...  'sudo mkdir /mnt/usb'
[05:15] <wastrel> !patience | JonBoon
[05:15] <ubotu> JonBoon: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[05:15] <mikedoty> It boots straight up in GUI mode
[05:15] <wsjunior> dfcarney: mount what?! /mnt/usb
[05:15] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  for instance...  'sudo mount /dev/dm-0 /mnt/usb'
[05:15] <Xaphoo> does anyone have any recommendations on trying ntfs-3g?
[05:15] <kmitch87> UKMatt: F-Spot is a great photo manager that should do the trick.
[05:15] <wsjunior> dfcarney: lets see
[05:15] <sethk> JonBoon, lots of traffic.  what's the question?
[05:15] <wastrel> woo that's more assholeish than i remember
[05:15] <JonBoon> hi, all my videos are playing dark in totem and vlc, any ideas why?
[05:15] <UKMatt> kmitch87, for video?
[05:15] <Dr_willis> Xaphoo,  how about 'backup your ntfs drives first' :)
[05:15] <wsjunior> dfcarney: there isnt such devs
[05:15] <ben_> ah, i got dillo working, what's the site to pastebin?
[05:15] <slide> How do I boot in to single user mode? I tried adding a -s after 'boot' in grub, but that didnt work
[05:16] <ianmacgregor> !paste
[05:16] <wsjunior> dfcarney: there isnt dm`s in /dev
[05:16] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[05:16] <JonBoon> it just suddenly started do this
[05:16] <kmitch87> UKMatt: sorry, thought you meant photos
[05:16] <dfcarney> Spawn: good
[05:16] <Xaphoo> heh ok :) the data is kind of precious it's true... do you know of anyone who has lost data though?
[05:16] <sethk> JonBoon, video isn't really my area, but the obvious question is, what's changed recently?
[05:16] <Spawn> Can someone explain to me what is shell? under user settings?
[05:16] <alex_mayorga> any xorg master around, for nth time my config got borked on dist-upgrade
[05:16] <kmitch87> UKMatt: you could try kino, its a video editor i think
[05:16] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  yeah, i was worried about that.  i'm going to poke around google.
[05:16] <JonBoon> nothing as far as i know
[05:16] <wastrel> mikedoty:  when you boot in non-recovery mode is it GUI or commandline
[05:16] <JonBoon> maybe rebooting will help
[05:16] <sevtastic> Xaphoo: go buy an external hdd and copy your data off the ntfs volume to the fat32 on your shiny new external hdd
[05:17] <UKMatt> kmitch87, I tried to open it but it gave me a DV error or something
[05:17] <JonBoon> brb
[05:17] <sevtastic> unless you wanna mount read only
[05:17] <mikedoty> When I boot in non-recovery mode it is GUI
[05:17] <Xaphoo> sevtastic: sounds like a good idea
[05:17] <Xaphoo> those things are cheap now anyway
[05:17] <kmitch87> UKMatt: do you have codecs installed to handle it?
[05:17] <ben_> this is my console output http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29496/
[05:17] <sevtastic> ntfs ro is fine, rw can cause problems
[05:17] <optiq> hello anyone happen to have that fstab script handy?
[05:17] <wsjunior>  dfcarney there is /dev/evms/dm
[05:17] <UKMatt> kmitch87, i'm pretty sure
[05:17] <Xaphoo> yeah
[05:18] <PreZLaptop> *sigh*
[05:18] <Kr0ntab> anyone else having issues with mozilla-mplayer / w32codecs playing wma's recently?
[05:18] <mikedoty> AFter it loads, it give sme a terminal window on the desktop
[05:18] <wsjunior> dfcarney: and the rest inside of it
[05:18] <PreZLaptop> I now have to wait for my CPUs to arrive
[05:18] <mike_> anybody get samba running on ubuntu?
[05:18] <kmitch87> UKMatt: not sure how to help on this one...sorry
[05:18] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  well, you could try one of those instead of /dev/dm-0, i suppose
[05:18] <Kr0ntab> 6.10 by the way
[05:18] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  i don't know what'll happen, however.
[05:18] <wastrel> mikedoty: can you pastebin the errors?
[05:18] <sethk> ben_, looks like a library/program mismatch of some sort.  I would generate a core file.  (If you don't know how to generate a core, then ask.)
[05:19] <ben_> i have no idea how to generate a core file, please enlighten me
[05:19] <wsjunior> dfcarney: there isnt dm-anything inside :/
[05:19] <sethk> ben_, in the console, run (before running the program)   ulimit -c 1024
[05:19] <wsjunior> dfcarney: when i try to mount it i get that it isnt a block device
[05:19] <sethk> ben_, 1024 is just a guess, might need a bigger number
[05:19] <optiq> anyone know the link to the automatic fstab script?
[05:19] <Xzyx987X> hey, in kde, can you set file permissions user by user rather than by owner, group and others?
[05:20] <mikedoty> I would, but it doesn't let me copy when it shows the errors in a dialog box.  It says something about having them in the ~\xsession-errors file, but I have no idea where to find that on the drive
[05:20] <sethk> ben_, use 65000, it doesn't matter as long as it is larger than the core file to be created
[05:20] <ben_> alright, then i just have to make it crash right
[05:20] <ben_> that'll take 3 seconds, tops
[05:20] <sevtastic> mikedoty: try typing 'less ~\xsession-errors'
[05:20] <mikedoty> It wasn't in the var/whatever/ folder someone suggested, I also did a file search and couldn't find it
[05:20] <sevtastic> er
[05:20] <sethk> ben_, once you get the core file, you use gdb to get a stack trace.  That tells you which library you were in when the seg fault occured.
[05:21] <sevtastic> ~/xsession-errors
[05:21] <sethk> ben_, if that doesn't work for you, you can run the program under strace
[05:21] <sevtastic> wrong direction on your slash
[05:21] <sevtastic> it's / in unix
[05:21] <sevtastic> or *nix in general
[05:21] <sethk> ben_, that's easy, you just do     strace whatever            where whatever is the command you are using to run the browser
[05:21] <sevtastic> not \
[05:21] <wastrel> mikedoty:  so your X server is working you're just not getting into gnome
[05:21] <sethk> sevtastic, it's / in windows also, if you use a decent shell.  :)
[05:21] <mikedoty> I think it's something like that wastrel
[05:21] <wastrel> mikedoty:  somethings crashing your gnome in the user account you're trying to log into
[05:22] <dfcarney> wsjunior:  i'll be right back -- i'm going to reboot my system.
[05:22] <sevtastic> yeah but how many people on windows use a "decent shell"?
[05:22] <mikedoty> I tried typing less ~/xsession-errors but it just keeps giving me file not found errors
[05:22] <ben_> thanks, i'm doing it now
[05:22] <sethk> ben_, do strace -o outputfilename whatever.   then paste the contents of the outputfilename.  You really only care about the last 30 lines or so in the strace output.
[05:22] <mikedoty> Unless I'm entering it in totally the wrong palce
[05:22] <mikedoty> place
[05:22] <sevtastic> it's a utilitarian answer
[05:22] <sevtastic> :)
[05:22] <wastrel> mikedoty:  your .xsession-errors   is in  /home/your-username/.xsession-errors
[05:23] <Xzyx987X> cmon, who can help me out here with file permissions?
[05:23] <lando> mikedoty: forgot the dot before the file name cause its hidden
[05:23] <Xaphoo> why is GFCE so bad
[05:23] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, what you need
[05:23] <sethk> sevtastic, more than in the past, actually.  Korn published a windows/ntfs version of ksh.  Plus you can of course use zsh, or bash, if you want to slum
[05:23] <Xaphoo> you'd think they would be able to make a good NES emulator by now but GFCE sucks
[05:23] <Xaphoo> so slow and sound doesnt work
[05:23] <Xzyx987X> I mounted an ntfs drive in kubuntu ok
[05:23] <Xzyx987X> but it sets up the owner as root
[05:23] <sevtastic> sethk: that's exactly my point
[05:23] <Xzyx987X> and it only provides read access
[05:23] <mike_> anybody know how to get the codec for playing mp3's on ubuntu
[05:23] <wastrel> !ntfs | Xzyx987X
[05:23] <ubotu> Xzyx987X: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[05:23] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, ntfs write is not on  by default

[05:23] <kmaynard> !ntfs > Xzyx987X
[05:24] <macri> what is the best site for ubuntu tips and tricks
[05:24] <sevtastic> coming from windows land, of course

[05:24] <Xzyx987X> ok, but I don't want to write to it
[05:24] <sethk> sevtastic, true, but it's nice to take the opportunity to tell them there are good shells available for windows
[05:24] <mikedoty> Ok I finally found it...
[05:24] <macri> wastrel thanks
[05:24] <sevtastic> oh of course
[05:24] <Xzyx987X> the problem is I can't change the read permission
[05:24] <sevtastic> we're educating the public right now
[05:24] <slide> How do I boot into single user mode from grub?
[05:24] <sevtastic> in this mishmash of random help blurbs
[05:24] <compudaze> macri: also ubuntuguide.org
[05:24] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, IS THERE AN ENTRY FOR IT IN /ETC/FSTRAB ?
[05:24] <kmaynard> crap
[05:24] <kmitch87> slide: recovery mode from grub boot menu
[05:25] <Xzyx987X> I'll check...
[05:25] <kmaynard> tab is so close to caps lock
[05:25] <mikedoty> http://deadbeefbabe.org/paste/2393
[05:25] <slide> hrm
[05:25] <sevtastic> kmaynard: shift is so close to ctrl.
[05:25] <kmaynard> sevtastic, ha :)
[05:25] <wastrel> slide:  hit esc to get the grub menu up
[05:25] <Xzyx987X> /etc/fstrab doesn't even exist on my system
[05:26] <sevtastic> in fact, i'd say half the keys on any keyboard are so close to the other half of the keys
[05:26] <Xaphoo> fstab, not fstrab
[05:26] <wastrel> /etc/fstab
[05:26] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, i meant /etc/fstab
[05:26] <kmaynard> sorry
[05:26] <MusicKing> how do I disable the broadcom drivers?
[05:26] <Xzyx987X> neither exists...
[05:26] <UKMatt> I have a .avi from my camera that is sideways, what software should I use to rotate it
[05:26] <ben_> the last 30 lines say the same thing
[05:26] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, sudo vi /etc/fstab
[05:26] <sevtastic> Xzyx987X: gotta sudo it
[05:26] <sevtastic> yeah
[05:26] <kmitch87> MusicKing: presumably 'modprobe -r <driver>'
[05:27] <sethk> MusicKing, you can rmmod the kernel module for it
[05:27] <dabaR> MusicKing: how did you enable them?
[05:27] <Xzyx987X> I was browsing the folder in a sudoed konqueror window
[05:27] <MusicKing> well I assume that's what is enabled by default
[05:27] <MusicKing> I am trying to get my wireless to work
[05:27] <MusicKing> and I read a post on a forum saying to remove the broadcom drivers
[05:27] <kmaynard> !fuse
[05:27] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[05:27] <dfcarney> wsjunior: on my system, the /dev/dm-X devices get mapped automatically to /dev/sdY devices
[05:27] <wheelswitch> ftp is not working for me, i have port 21 fowarded correctly on the router, is there some sort of trace command i can use to see if my isp has blocked port 21?
[05:28] <dfcarney> wsjunior: hmmmm....
[05:28] <tylere> Just rolled a new system with Ubuntu 06.10....good news and bad news. 3d accel under fglrx works great. But I can't get it to run to run at a reasonable resolution. It insists on running X at something like 2036x1400...whatever the top rez on my monitor is
[05:28] <Xzyx987X> ok, here is the entry: /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 auto nouser,atime,auto,rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0
[05:28] <sethk> MusicKing, very unlikely that removing a driver will help you.  but I suppose it can't hurt.
[05:28] <mike_> there was nothing about playing mp3's
[05:28] <MusicKing> any other suggestions
[05:28] <sethk> MusicKing, we don't even know whether the driver is loaded.
[05:28] <sevtastic> wheelswitch: you trying to connect to your local ftp server?
[05:28] <kmitch87> MusicKing: do you know the chipset for your wireless card?
[05:28] <dabaR> MusicKing: lsmod|grep bcm
[05:28] <MusicKing> well a driver has to be loaded since I am using internet
[05:28] <Xzyx987X> so how do I make it readable to non-root users?
[05:28] <MusicKing> it's a wpc54g v2 linksys card
[05:28] <kmaynard> Xzyx987X, and you cant read it?
[05:28] <Xzyx987X> only as root
[05:28] <wheelswitch> sevtastic:  no, any ftp server, not local
[05:29] <Xzyx987X> and I can't change the permission

[05:35] <twizmode> sweet
[05:35] <twizmode> is this a good distro for newbies?
[05:35] <medic30420> jrib, unfortunately that doesn't work, the next time i open the file it still defaults to the origional association
[05:35] <twizmode> or should I stoop down to like linspire?
[05:35] <twizmode> lol
[05:35] <mike_> sevtastic, that has nothing to do with mp3 codecs
[05:35] <ben_> twizmode, just let the disk do it's job, it autodetects windows partitions
[05:35] <mikedoty> I'm back to where I started I think
[05:36] <mikedoty> I think I have the nvidia drivers selected
[05:36] <roverr> twizmode: as always backup your existing system first
[05:36] <xipietotec> twizmode: linspire teaches bad habits
[05:36] <twizmode> o sweet
[05:36] <jrib> medic30420: did you go to right click, the PROPERTIES, and then open with tab inside properties?
[05:36] <mikedoty> But now I'm stuck in 800x600 again
[05:36] <sevtastic> mike_: it has a lot of codecs. if you just wanna play mp3s then get xmms and use that
[05:36] <dfcarney> wsjunior: uh, sure.  though i can't promise you more than 30-40 minutes of my time.
[05:36] <twizmode> I dont have anything important if it wipes xp
[05:36] <sethk> ben_, that's almost certainly caused by corrupted memory, which helps us only marginally.
[05:36] <jrib> medic30420: s/the/then
[05:36] <twizmode> maybe its a blessing if it wipes xp
[05:36] <twizmode> lol
[05:36] <mike_> xmms won't play across the network
[05:36] <mike_> sevtastic,
[05:36] <mikedoty> I'm trying to edit etc/X11/xorg.conf to add "1024x768" alongside the two lower resolutions, but it tells me I don't have permission to save...
[05:36] <wsjunior> dfcarney: google isnt too helpfull with this issue
[05:36] <ben_> as in some of my RAM is bad?
[05:37] <sevtastic> mike_:  sure it will.
[05:37] <sethk> ben_, do you have konqueror installed?  If so, have you tried it? It's different enough that it might provide clues even if it won't run.
[05:37] <sethk> ben_, no
[05:37] <dfcarney> wsjunior: no, it isn't.  currently, i'm reading the man pages on 'udev'
[05:37] <twizmode> is there a way to install the iso from my hard drive? I have a burner but not on this pc dont feel like takeing it out of my old one and puting it in this comp
[05:37] <sethk> ben_, as in the software stepped all over the code
[05:37] <Specialbuddy> what's the difference between beryl and compiz?
[05:37] <medic30420> jrib, thanks, that was the step i missed
[05:37] <jrib> medic30420: np
[05:37] <Xaphoo> beryl is newer, buggier
[05:37] <xipietotec> Specialbuddy: beryl > compiz
[05:37] <PhlostenLch> mikedoty; sudo gedit "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[05:37] <Xaphoo> it is the continuation of compiz... compiz is the old stable version of beryl, sort of
[05:37] <Specialbuddy> why is it better?
[05:37] <sethk> ben_, what was the specific change that broke the browsers?  (Or was is a mega package install and you don't know)?
[05:37] <ben_> sethk, right now both firefox and an old version of mozilla crash like that, but dillo works
[05:38] <mike_> sevtastic, how do you get xmms to play a folder across the network?
[05:38] <sutur> i do this only because i'm desperate; i repeat my request: hi, does anyone know where the gnome-session-properties dialog saves the startup list? i am not able to add new scripts to the startup list. it just kinda "forgets" what i entered after closing the dialog...
[05:38] <ben_> i upgraded to edgy
[05:38] <mrJungle> Hey everybody. I'm just installed Edgy for the first time (I used Breezy for a little while), but am having problems getting my wlan interface to work. I have ndiswrapper installed and running, but I'm kind of at a loss. Anybody got any helpful hints?
[05:38] <xipietotec> it does more,looks prettier, etc. =) has more opions
[05:38] <xipietotec> options
[05:38] <sevtastic> mike_: you mount the samba share to a folder and then select it through xmms. not much more to it
[05:38] <mikedoty> There we go, thanks PhlostenLch
[05:38] <mikedoty> Now let's see if that works
[05:38] <sevtastic> unless i'm totally missing something
[05:38] <xipietotec> mrJungle: sudo ifconfig wlan0
[05:38] <mike_> hmmm
[05:38] <sethk> ben_, ok.  mozilla and firefox use the same underlying engine, so that makes sense.
[05:38] <gevaudan> mike_: xmms can't play samba shares if you are mounting them using ubuntu's 'Connect to server' tool...you'll have to physically mount the drives first
[05:39] <mike_> crazy enough to work
[05:39] <wsjunior> dfcarney: it should be in /dev/sda1.. something is wrong..
[05:39] <mrJungle> xipietotec: wlan0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
[05:39] <sethk> ben_, I'd try a forced reinstall of firefox, forcing all the dependent packages as well.
[05:39] <mrJungle> xipietotec: I do have eth1 which looks to be the wireless interface
[05:39] <sethk> ben_, you can run the command ldd to get a list of shared libs used by firefox
[05:39] <sevtastic> btw, fc6 is pretty cool
[05:39] <Specialbuddy> what should I try with beryl that wasn't on compiz?
[05:39] <sevtastic> compiz at the click of a button
[05:39] <xipietotec> mrJungle: then it automatically changed wlan0 to eth1
[05:40] <sethk> ben_, possibly the library name will suggest something
[05:40] <xipietotec> work with eth1
[05:40] <alex_mayorga> anyone to help me with a borked upgrade to Edgy?
[05:40] <mikedoty> :(  that just made the size of the desktop itself larger so I could scroll around on it like a starcraft map
[05:40] <roverr> twizmode: iirc you can put the iso on a usb stick and install from there.  there's a wiki page about it somewhere.  never done it myself
[05:40] <sethk> sevtastic, I'm using fc6 at work, and it's fine, after I hack on it a bit.
[05:40] <dfcarney> wsjunior: yup.  i'm guessing that the device simply isn't being recognized by the kernel properly
[05:40] <gevaudan> sevtatic: is it fast? in my experience, fedora always seems slow compared to ubuntu at least during the default install
[05:40] <sethk> sevtastic, but I hack on ubuntu a bit as well.
[05:40] <xipietotec> my wireless card does the same, I have to (on startup) do sudo ifconfig wlan0, then sudo iwlist eth1 scan, because it reassigns wlan0 to be eth1
[05:40] <mrJungle> xipietotec: I have been, but it still doesn't want to perform a scan
[05:40] <kbrosnan> ben_: are you using any plugins? about:plugins in the address bar that can also cause both to be crashy in the same way
[05:40] <twizmode> roverr: ill just put my burner in
[05:40] <twizmode> thx for all the help
[05:40] <sevtastic> i didn't get to play with it much. coworker set it up on his work rig
[05:41] <sevtastic> it seemed alright
[05:41] <twizmode> ill hopefully be back in a bout a hour or two with it installed
[05:41] <twizmode> <3
[05:41] <sethk> gevaudan, I've installed fc6 and ubuntu on the identical hardware, dual boot.  I found no measuarable difference
[05:41] <mike_> gevaudan, how do I phyisically mount the share
[05:41] <xipietotec> mrJungle: what's it say for eth1?
[05:41] <twizmode> ubuntu has a very good community.. any other distro just flames you if you ask any nub questions
[05:41] <sethk> gevaudan, talking about performance after installation, not how long it takes to install.
[05:41] <mike_> I have it created to my desktop but the playlist won't find it
[05:41] <dfcarney> wsjunior: do you know whether or not the device has linux support?
[05:41] <gevaudan> sethk: in /etc/fstab type /hostname/sharename /folder/where/i/want/tomount o 00 i think it is
[05:41] <mrJungle> xipietotec: for iwconfig or iwlist?
[05:41] <ben_> i reinstalled, ran in safe mode, tried old versions, deleted the program folder as per the mozilla website and still nothing
[05:41] <xipietotec> iwlist
[05:41] <sevtastic> oh that's such a newb comment twizmode </sarcasm>
[05:41] <mikedoty> Well I'll try to play around wtih that some more tomorrow... if I can get higher resolutions going I"ll be in pretty good shape
[05:41] <twizmode> rofl
[05:41] <sethk> twizmode, well, change that to "many other distros".  Not _all_, I hope
[05:41] <twizmode> hehe
[05:41] <twizmode> bbl
[05:42] <twizmode> many other yes
[05:42] <twizmode> hehe
[05:42] <wsjunior> dfcarney: no but i could tell u which device is it. it is a sony memory stick pro duo
[05:42] <mrJungle> xipietotec: eth1      Interface doesn't support scanning : No such device
[05:42] <gevaudan> sethk: btw, mount the folder in /media if you want a desktop icon
[05:42] <mikedoty> thanks for your help wastrel, PhlostenLch and sevtastic
[05:42] <sevtastic> what do you MEAN you didn't already try this gentoo handbook thingy? don't bug us until you mess that up first!
[05:42] <roverr> twizmode: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
[05:42] <xipietotec> mrJungle: Okay, first did you do all the chmod stuff with ndiswrapper?
[05:42] <sethk> gevaudan, I think you aimed someone else's question at me.
[05:42] <Draconicus> Can somebody tell me where GDM keeps its WM list .desktop files?
[05:43] <sethk> gevaudan, might want to resend it to the real target.
[05:43] <mrJungle> No ..
[05:43] <sethk> Draconicus, it isn't quite that simple.
[05:43] <jrib> Draconicus: /usr/share/xsessions/  don't know if it checks other places too
[05:43] <babo> there's no checkinstall on edgy ?
[05:43] <ben_> alright, to use ldd what do i do?
[05:43] <babo> how do I install a .deb ?
[05:43] <sethk> Draconicus, you start with /etc/X11/gdm
[05:43] <xipietotec> mrJungle: Okay, you'll need to use a guide on ndiswrapper
[05:43] <gevaudan> sethk: heh, this channel moves so fast i forgot who it is already
[05:43] <Draconicus> Thanks.
[05:43] <sevtastic> babo: sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
[05:43] <gevaudan> babo: sudo dpkg -i *.deb
[05:43] <sevtastic> jinx!
[05:43] <wastrel> babo:  checkinstall exists , but it's not insalled by default - it's in universe
[05:43] <Xzyx987X> ok, before I mount the drive in the kde disk and file system settings the mount folder gives read access to all users, but once I mount it it's only readable by root
[05:44] <Xzyx987X> probably a side effect of the fact I mounted it in administrator mode...
[05:44] <sevtastic> Xzyx987X: you can use the --uid=xxx flag i think
[05:44] <sevtastic> where xxx is your user's uid
[05:45] <pritisd> hi all
[05:45] <xipietotec> mrJungle: try following the instructions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174
[05:45] <Xzyx987X> why can't I just give access to all users...
[05:46] <xipietotec> also, to note, just installing ndiswrapper does nothing, you also need the base portions of the drivers to wrap around mrJungle
[05:46] <Xzyx987X> in this case security isn't really a concern, and it makes my life a lot easier if I can do that...
[05:46] <pritisd> i've got "pinnacle pctv pci" card also "d-link DFM-560iS-IN softmodem" but mu ubuntu 6.0 doesn't detect both :(

[05:48] <gevaudan> pritisd: unfortunatly unless the manufacturer offers linux drivers or there is a post in ubuntu forums for a work around you are probally out of luck especially for niche cards like tv tuners
[05:48] <xipietotec> mrJungle: are they the bcmlXXX files?

[05:49] <zOrK> yeah
[05:49] <Icarus> how do i get rid of the edubuntu splash screen when ubuntu is loading all the drivers and replace it with the xubuntu?
[05:49] <wheelswitch> Halpo:  you mean crontab?
[05:49] <zOrK> just wondering
[05:49] <xipietotec> mrJungle: Okay, cool, there should be 2 files, and then you just follow the instructions on the guide I listed
[05:49] <Chippy> :)
[05:49] <Icarus> i installed all the xubuntu packages i found
[05:49] <zOrK> thanks guys
[05:49] <zOrK> :P
[05:49] <Icarus> and when i shutdown it shows the xubuntu splach
[05:49] <Icarus> splash*
[05:49] <ben_> sethk, is there any way i can try to update those or maybe a fresh install would help?
[05:49] <Halpo> wheelswitch: crontab?  i dont know what that is, but what I am talking about is the stuff in sched.c in the kernel
[05:49] <Icarus> but when i start up its the edubuntu one
[05:50] <jadacyrus> is there a program that will alow me to record video with my webcam?
[05:50] <pritisd> gevaudan, then i'll to switch over to windows? :(
[05:50] <xipietotec> Icarus, let me PM you with a general guide I have for configuring usplash
[05:50] <nothlit> Icarus >> sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[05:50] <Icarus> ok
[05:50] <nothlit> and choose the first option
[05:50] <sethk> ben_, if you don't mind a fresh install, it should fix it.  It isn't terribly hard to fix but unfortunately I have to go.  Work tommorow.  early.  I'll keep xchat up on my box at work, so if you are still having problems, look for me.
[05:50] <gevaudan> pritisd: hate to see you go...i still dual boot...as far as i am concerned both linux and windows have their place
[05:51] <jadacyrus> is there a program that will alow me to record video with my webcam?

[05:51] <mister_roboto> Halpo: have you tried google? it's kind of funny to me that you want to know the details of some Linux internals but don't know what cron is :)

[05:51] <Halpo> mister_roboto:  yes i've googled for about 10 min and havent found anything, just curious if someone had a good site bookmarked
[05:52] <nothlit> Icarus, do you have ubuntu-desktop installed?
[05:52] <jadacyrus> someone should probably answer my question
[05:52] <jadacyrus> lol
[05:52] <philip> compudaze: aiglx+beryl actually
[05:52] <philip> the effects
[05:52] <jadacyrus> it seems like a simple one
[05:52] <gevaudan> jadacyrus: if someone knows they will
[05:52] <compudaze> beryl is so cool then ;p
[05:52] <philip> true ;)
[05:52] <Icarus> i think so
[05:52] <dfcarney> wsjunior: i'm sorry, but i don't think that there's much that i can do to help you.  i need to learn more about the device management system in 2.6 before i can really debug it
[05:52] <samuel> sethk, thx.., wanted to try something else in the normal cd, but if thats the only alternative then thats it... thx
[05:52] <philip> i love my new ibm t30 :)
[05:52] <nothlit> Icarus, aptitude show ubuntu-desktop
[05:52] <gevaudan> compudaze: i installed beryl on an ati based laptop over the weekend...everything worked fine but the fonts were way too big...did you have this problem?
[05:52] <GirlRiver> is there a flash 8 for linux available ?
[05:53] <mister_roboto> Halpo: that's funny. i put "linux kernel scheduler" in google and the very first link was about the algorithms used by scheduling
[05:53] <mister_roboto> Halpo: you must not have looked very hard
[05:53] <mrkris> I can't seem to get nvidia drivers installed properly. I did as the ubuntuguide.org said, and now X won't start at all, even when I nvidia-glx-config disable
[05:53] <sethk> samuel, not saying it's the only alternative.  what did you want to try?
[05:53] <compudaze> i'm using compiz 0.2.2 and nvidia beta drivers, no problems for me
[05:53] <nothlit> Icarus,  if not, install package usplash-theme-ubuntu
[05:53] <gevaudan> GirlRiver: not in the ubuntu repositories...but i think you can install directly from macromedia...i was referred to macromedia.com by a website the other day and it was version 8
[05:53] <mister_roboto> Halpo: in fact, there are a ton of articles that came up on the first page
[05:53] <compudaze> no problems with beryl 0.1.1 either
[05:53] <nothlit> that should d/l it
[05:54] <Halpo> mister_roboto: ok, well thanks, but just so happens i didnt use the exact search phrase you did and didnt get the same links
[05:54] <Icarus> this is to get the xubuntu splash nothlit ?
[05:54] <ianmacgregor> How do I set the mouse wheel to scroll through the workspaces when I scroll the mouse wheel over the desktop?
[05:54] <Halpo> i was looking for sched.c stuff
[05:54] <wastrel> there's no flash 8 for linux there's a flash 9 beta available
[05:54] <kmaynard> flash 9 is out now
[05:54] <GirlRiver> gevaudan: thanks ... I will try again as I only found MMFP 7 for linux
[05:54] <xipietotec> Icarus: no, it's the ubuntu usplash
[05:54] <xipietotec> not the xubuntu
[05:54] <Icarus> im trying to get the xubuntu splash
[05:54] <mister_roboto> halpo: first rule of google is try altering your search terms a little if you're not finding what you want
[05:54] <Icarus> and get rid of the edubuntu
[05:54] <xipietotec> Icarus: Please see the guide I sent you
[05:55] <nothlit> Icarus,  oh oops, you want the xubuntu splash gimme a sec
=== Cre[a] tiveEmb[a]  is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[05:55] <xipietotec> nothlit: he allready has it installed
[05:55] <mrkris> (WW) NV: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:1:0:0) found
[05:55] <mike_> help with totem codec please?
[05:55] <levander> Is there any difference to the end user if he runs the 64 bit distro?  Are as many applications available?  Is it faster to run 64 bit?
[05:55] <xipietotec> he's just getting the xubuntu usplash on shutdown, and the edubuntu one on startup
[05:55] <nothlit> Icarus, make sure xubuntu-artwork-usplash is installed
[05:55] <Icarus> it is
[05:55] <AqD> hi all!
[05:55] <Icarus> i get it when i shutdown
[05:55] <philip> btw
[05:55] <AqD> OMG there are 1001 ppl
[05:56] <Icarus> but when i start i get the edubuntu splash
[05:56] <AqD> and i'm the 1001 :D
[05:56] <Chippy> 1000
[05:56] <GirlRiver> gevaudan: nope ... no Flash 8 for Linux there. Pity I can't make my v7 look like a v8 to the pages that need 8
[05:56] <compudaze> nope, 1000
[05:56] <philip> what source do i need for mplayer?
[05:56] <xipietotec> ....
[05:56] <AqD> anyone who use my mac menubar would like have his screenshot on the howto?
[05:56] <ianmacgregor> !mplayer > philip
[05:56] <AqD> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241868
[05:56] <nothlit> Icarus,  and nothing shows up in the update alternatives setup utility other than edubuntu?
[05:56] <AqD> i just put zammi's
[05:56] <Icarus> just default and edubuntu
[05:57] <gevaudan> GirlRiver: i guess you are right (http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash)...i didn't look at the version very close
[05:57] <Icarus> but i know i have xubuntu installed
[05:57] <roverr> levander: imho unless you need gobs of ram to support a massive db or such stick with the 32bit version.  a few things don't work right with 64bit
[05:57] <roverr> imho
[05:57] <philip> ianmacgregor: thanks
[05:57] <AqD> does xubuntu use xfce 4.4?
[05:57] <levander> roverr: yeah, that's prolly what i'll do
[05:57] <kmaynard> 64 is better suited for servers
[05:57] <levander> roverr: what doesn't work right?
[05:57] <xipietotec> Icarus: try this then sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/lib/usplash/usplash-artwork.so usplash-artwork.so /usr/lib/usplash/xubuntu-artwork-usplash.so 60
[05:57] <nothlit> well choose the default and take restart and see if it worked or try xipietotec 's guide
[05:57] <kmaynard> the only good 64 bit desktop is os x :)
[05:58] <roverr> levander: i run a bunch of very high usage, big ram servers, 32 bit is ok
[05:58] <levander> i'm just getting a 64 bit CPU in the mail tomorrow, was wondering if i should try it
[05:58] <GirlRiver> can anyone tell me if I can 'mask" my flash player so web pages think it is v8 & stop telling me to upgrade
[05:58] <B|nTaRa> !install
[05:58] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[05:58] <levander> roverr: i do server side web development (not HTML/Javascript but Ruby on Rails and Java stuff)
[05:58] <xipietotec> Feisty will hopefully make ubuntu BiArch compatible and thus make 64bit ubuntu more useable as a desktop program
[05:58] <xipietotec> err...OS
[05:58] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: download the latest fash beta 9
[05:58] <roverr> levander: cool
[05:58] <levander> Does 64 bit OS's take more RAM?
[05:58] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: it is soooo much nicer
[05:59] <xipietotec> levander: no.
[05:59] <levander> roverr: would 64 bits help doing server side devel?
[05:59] <xipietotec> it takes a 64 bit processor
[05:59] <gevaudan> levander: for development? not at all
[05:59] <levander> roverr: how does 64 bit help big web servers?
[05:59] <AqD> more RAM
[05:59] <GirlRiver> knitch87: thx ... can you give me a link please ?
[05:59] <philip> ianmacgregor: i always get "is available from another installation source" :(
[05:59] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: hang on a sec...
[05:59] <xipietotec> by allowing 64 bit execution...e.g. it's faster if you run 64 bit applications
[05:59] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: thx
[06:00] <kmaynard> google flash 9 linux download
[06:00] <chevin> !w32codecs
[06:00] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:00] <kmaynard> !flash
[06:00] <xipietotec> you want flash 9 or w32codecs?
[06:00] <xipietotec> !seveas
[06:00] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:00] <AqD> xipietotec: only a few parts are faster
[06:00] <AqD> since most operations still use integer, not 64bit long
[06:00] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: try this: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[06:00] <roverr> levander: not in the usual case.  i've got 32bit os on big 4x xeon's with 16G's of ram and punching tons of data down the wire.  64bit ain't quite cooked yet in general.  special cases yeah.  you probably don't fit into to those though.
[06:00] <xipietotec> AqD: correct
[06:01] <xipietotec> it's just like dual threading is faster...but most people don't write dual thread apps
[06:01] <B|nTaRa> my ubuntu liveCD hang on startup (just showed Gnome Splash Screen)
[06:01] <levander> roverr: okay, cool, thanks
[06:01] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: you want the installer for linux
[06:01] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: excellent .. thank you .. any special tips for downloading it or is it pretty straightforward?
[06:01] <wheelswitch> does 'telnet ftp.freepgs.com 21' work for anyone?
[06:01] <gevaudan> levander: unless you are supporting mostly 64 bit apps stick with 32 bit...you'll quickly run into issues where you have to eitehr compile from source or take a few extra steps in order to get existing howto guides to work for you
[06:01] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: pretty straight foward.
[06:02] <kmaynard> download it, put the .so file in .mozilla/plugins
[06:02] <B|nTaRa> im using this iso : ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
[06:02] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: anything I need to know to run the installer on ubuntu ?
[06:02] <nothlit> levander, i think you'll have issues with the flash binary as well if you use 64 bit
[06:02] <Xaphoo> how do I change the sound driver that is specified by "sounddriver default" in some config files?
[06:02] <regeya> emacs is frickin huge.  also I would expect 'make' to take longer than 'make boostrap'
[06:02] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: put the .so file in your firefox plugins directory
[06:03] <nothlit> GirlRiver, just make the install script executable and run it in console, you don't even need root privileges
[06:03] <Icarus> thanks xipietotec , nothlit
[06:03] <Icarus> works now
[06:03] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: plugins directory is in .mozilla/ i think
[06:03] <Icarus> is there anyway to make terminal always on top?
[06:03] <nothlit> Icarus, right click the titlebar and select always on top
[06:03] <Icarus> i dont see the option
[06:04] <ianmacgregor> Icarus: Right-click the titlebar, there's an option in that menu
[06:04] <GirlRiver> nothlit:: I am a newb ... how do i make it executable ?
[06:04] <Halpo> is there a program that will read all wireless networks that are broadcast there SSID?
[06:04] <regeya> oh dear.  gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
[06:04] <regeya> Err http://us.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/main Packages
[06:04] <gevaudan> GirlRiver: sudo chmod +x filename
[06:04] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: chmod +x filename
[06:04] <Icarus> lol
[06:04] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: yes, it works
[06:04] <Icarus> thanks
[06:04] <kmaynard> GirlRiver, there's a readme included with flash 9...it tells you what to do too
[06:04] <GirlRiver> thank you x1000
[06:04] <xipietotec> Halpo: sudo iwlist wlanX/ethX scan
[06:04] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  thanks, if any one wants to help with why that doesnt work for me let me know...
[06:04] <ztg> anyone good with advanced file permissions?
[06:04] <wheelswitch> other ftp sites work
[06:05] <gevaudan> GirlRiver: btw, after chmodding it to run it type ./filename
[06:05] <philip> so no hint for me why mplayer has no installation candidate despite having enabled multiverse?
[06:05] <ixian_> anyone try easyubuntu on 6.10? does it work?
[06:05] <wheelswitch> port is fowarded correctly on my router
[06:05] <ianmacgregor> ztg: I can try
[06:05] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: what exactly is not working? you do know it's an ftp server, right?
[06:05] <gevaudan> ztg: did 770 not work for you? the 77 gives the owner and world rwx permissions and the 0 gives others no permissions
[06:05] <xipietotec> philip: Did you run sudo aptitude update?
[06:05] <philip> apt-get update
[06:06] <xipietotec> it didn't give you an error?
[06:06] <philip> nope
[06:06] <nothlit> Can someone tell me what the big deal about people hating the sudo in ubuntu? sudo -i is pretty similar, unless they like having a different profile as well.
[06:06] <B|nTaRa> my ubuntu liveCD hang on startup (just showed Gnome Splash Screen)
[06:06] <philip> just some key error for another repos
[06:06] <B|nTaRa> im using this iso : ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
[06:06] <gevaudan> nothlit: it's fine...besides if you want root sudo passwd root
[06:06] <xipietotec> philip: but no "malformed line at X" ?
[06:06] <ztg> I'm trying to set up a webserver to have permissions that the normal ftp user acct has rw perms, a developer account has rw, and other users don't have any perms
[06:06] <kmitch87> nothlit: some people just like having a seperate root account.
[06:07] <ianmacgregor> gevaudan: Setting a root password is not supported and is a bad idea. Please don't encourage people to do that.
[06:07] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  yeah, i know it is an ftp server, and it was working untill a couple of nights ago
[06:07] <nothlit> B|nTaRa, did your old cd work? have you verified you downloaded it correctly and used md5 checking on it?
[06:07] <roverr> ztg: if the webserver isn't doesn't run as the user or the group it won't be able to read those files
[06:07] <B|nTaRa> nothlit : yes
[06:07] <philip> xipietotec: it was my fault, sorry
[06:07] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: well what's not working now then?
[06:07] <xipietotec> no problem =)
[06:07] <philip> i mixed up backports multiverse with multiverse
[06:07] <philip> but thanks for caring
[06:07] <wheelswitch> i can not log into the ftp server
[06:07] <nothlit> B|nTaRa, you could always use the compatibility mode to install or the alternate cd
[06:07] <wheelswitch> it just times out all the time, mister_roboto
[06:08] <gevaudan> ianmacgregor: typing sudo before each and every iptables rules gets old really fast...it's a tradeoff of convenience and security
[06:08] <xipietotec> I like to help with what I can =)
[06:08] <dfcarney> gevaudan: just use 'sudo su -' to switch to a full-time root console
[06:08] <nothlit> gevaudan, but if you type sudo -i you can run all your commands without the sudo prefix
[06:08] <ianmacgregor> gevaudan: Understood, but sudo is the way of Ubuntu. Besides it makes the computer more secure.
[06:08] <nothlit> or that ^
[06:09] <ixian_> anyone try easyubuntu on 6.10? does it work?
[06:09] <gevaudan> all: didn't know about the sudo -i switch...good to know
[06:09] <wastrel> <3 sudo -i
[06:09] <ztg> roverr I'm just trying to avoid logging in as root to do maintenance on accounts
[06:09] <wheelswitch> is there any way i can trace where the connection is getting stopped?
[06:09] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: sorry, i don't have an account there so i can't actually try anything. the banner message warns about a 15 minute idle timeout but i'm guessing that's not what you're talking about
[06:10] <roverr> ztg: look at the apache (i assume) config, maybe you can use the public_html hack
[06:10] <nothlit> wheelswitch, you could try a ping/routing utility
[06:10] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: like traceroute?
[06:10] <Specialbuddy> are we ever going to be able to watch .wmv in firefox?
[06:10] <xipietotec> I'd like to know a way to uninstall kubuntu-artwork-usplash from usplash.so without uninstalling kubuntu-artwork-usplash from my actual computer
[06:10] <wheelswitch> dfcarney, ill have a look at that
[06:10] <mister_roboto> nothlit: obviously he has a route to the machine and can  ping it if he's connecting to it
[06:10] <gevaudan> wheelswitch: not sure what you are trying to do but if you want to see when the connection gets dropped type netstat -an
[06:11] <nothlit> Specialbuddy, have you tried the vlc firefox plugin?
[06:11] <dfcarney> mister_roboto: i didn't see the entire conversation -- just tuned in.
[06:11] <gevaudan> wheelswitch:  append | grep 'whatever' if you are looking for a specific service
[06:11] <compudaze> xipietotec: do you want to change the splash or disable it?
[06:11] <ztg> public_html hack? I'm already using /home/user/public_html as the document root
[06:11] <Specialbuddy> yeah
[06:11] <xipietotec> sudo update-alternatives --remove /usr/lib/usplash/usplash-artwork.so usplash-artwork.so /usr/lib/usplash/kubuntu-artwork-usplash.so 60 maybe?
[06:11] <Specialbuddy> it didn't work
[06:11] <Gambitt> Hi folks, I've never used any type of linux/unix before and was hoping to find a version that I could boot from a cd/dvd without having to install anything (hopefully keep from, messing anything up permanently that way) any suggestions?
[06:11] <nothlit> Specialbuddy,  you can try the mplayer plugin and the other one as well
[06:11] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  i can not connect to it
[06:11] <gevaudan> Gambitt: knoppix in my opinion is the most full featured livecd
[06:11] <wheelswitch> ill pm you an account details
[06:11] <kmitch87> Gambitt: a live cd is the best choice
[06:12] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: oh, sorry!  misunderstanding
[06:12] <ixian_> knoppix is a good livecd
[06:12] <xipietotec> compudaze: disable it
[06:12] <Specialbuddy> do I have to download mplayer from somewhere other then synaptic?
[06:12] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: so the connect is timing out?
[06:12] <ixian_> comes with a lot of stuff
[06:12] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: no
[06:12] <xipietotec> so that usplash.so doesn't even see it as being there
[06:12] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  yes, it is timing out
[06:12] <wheelswitch> it makes gftp hang
[06:12] <Specialbuddy> it's on apt?
[06:12] <compudaze> xipietotec: look in /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove 'splash' from your kernel line
[06:12] <wheelswitch> and ftp / lftp from the command line doesnt get any where
[06:12] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: can you ping it?
[06:12] <Gambitt> thanks gevaudan kmitch87 ixian_
[06:13] <vermyndax> anyone around that can help with a server mail questioN/
[06:13] <vermyndax> ?
[06:13] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: if i were you i would stay clear from the mplayer plugin...sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't...instead download the mediaconnectivity plugin for firefox which allows you to open a GUI instance of mplayer for all your media files...works without a kick
[06:13] <nothlit> Specialbuddy, all three firefox media plugins are in the ubuntu apt repositories
[06:13] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  yeah, pings fine
[06:13] <wheelswitch> is there a way to ping on port 21?
[06:13] <xipietotec> compudaze: nono, I want to disable kubuntu-artwork-usplash, not usplash itself
[06:13] <xipietotec> I have another usplash installed, but usplash.so is buggy, so it's overwriting the text in verbose mode with kubuntu's color scheme
[06:13] <xipietotec> despite the fact that it's correctly showing the new splash
[06:13] <Specialbuddy> thank you for the help
[06:13] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: tcpdump may be your best bet.  at least you can monitor the traffic to see what's going on...but before doing that, just try telnetting to port 21 on the remote machine
[06:13] <gevaudan> wheelswitch: assuming the site you are pinging hasn't disabled icmp of course
[06:13] <compudaze> xipietotec: u want to change it?
[06:14] <compudaze> xipietotec: to another splash?
[06:14] <wheelswitch> dfcarney, telneting doesnt work, times out
[06:14] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: well, it would see that the site is probably down
[06:14] <xipietotec> compudaze: no...I have allready changed it, to a custom splash, however, the kubuntu settings on the text in verbose mode will not change
[06:14] <gevaudan> wheelswitch: do an sudo nmap -sS site to see if port 21 is even open
[06:14] <roverr> ztg: could be i don't understand.  can you be more verbose?
[06:14] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: it's not
[06:14] <w00> having trouble getting the java plugin into the file so i can install
[06:14] <xipietotec> no matter what usplash I change it to
[06:14] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: i can connect to it
[06:14] <Lam_> $sudo apt-get install firefox ... what version is it?
[06:14] <xipietotec> kubuntu usplash has overridden all text color options
[06:15] <dfcarney> mister_roboto: ah, sorry that i missed your comment about that.
[06:15] <kmitch87> Lam_: what are you trying to do?
[06:15] <vermyndax> anyone who can help with postfix/amavis: I have a quarantine user set up with an account... for some reason though, the mail goes to /var/mail/<user> instead of the homedir/MailDir of that user
[06:15] <compudaze> did u regen the initrd
[06:15] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: have downloaded Beta 9 flash and there is only an . so & readme, there is no install script to make executable
[06:15] <Lam_> kmitch87: i plan to install firefox to replace konqueror, but i don't know if the repositories have version 2.0 yet
[06:15] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: maybe he is not routing to it?
[06:15] <xipietotec> compudaze: Yes, that's why I have a new usplash graphic at all
[06:15] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: no... he can ping it
[06:15] <kmitch87> Lam_: edgy already has 2.0
[06:15] <xipietotec> I want to remove kubuntu usplash from usplash.so
[06:16] <xipietotec> that's going to be the only way to get it to go away
[06:16] <Lam_> kmitch87: ok that's what i wanted to know. thanks
[06:16] <Specialbuddy> gevaudan, what plugin should I get
[06:16] <dfcarney> mister_roboto: so he can ping it, but not telnet to port 21?
[06:16] <compudaze> if you updated the alternative
[06:16] <compudaze> that should be it
[06:16] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: the .so file goes in your firefox plugin directory
[06:16] <wheelswitch> dfcarney:  that is correct
[06:16] <compudaze> duno sorry
[06:16] <xipietotec> compudaze: And it isn't =) like I said.
[06:16] <gevaudan> vermyndax: do a search for firefox mediaplayerconnectivity
[06:16] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: and you can FTP to other servers?
[06:16] <wheelswitch> 64.193.110.130 is that the ip it is connecting to for you mister_roboto ?
[06:16] <vermyndax> gevaudan: I would but... I'm looking for help with postfix/amavis ;)
[06:16] <wheelswitch> dfcarney:  yeah
[06:17] <compudaze> i never had any trouble changing it
[06:17] <ztg> i have user accounts that server sites from /home/user/public_html, and I want a developer account to be able to rw to those directories as well, but I do not want users to be able to view the contents of home dirs that they don't own
[06:17] <xipietotec> it doesn't help that I get an error from initramfs
[06:17] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: yes, that's it
[06:17] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: should I uninstall Flash 7 first ?
[06:17] <l337f00l> can anyone help me with installing an older version of Lame
[06:17] <mitrovarr> what's the best file system for a large drive that needs to be accessed by both linux and windows?
[06:17] <wheelswitch> and i could ftp into this site untill a couple of nights ago
[06:17] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: any chance they filtered you out at the firewall for being a bad boy or something?  it's a private server :)
[06:17] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: yes
[06:17] <gevaudan> vermyndax: are you using kubuntu? i had this problem but for the life of me i can't remember what i did to get it sorted out...i remember i downloaded mutt to verify system mails were coming in and then...well ic an't remember :(
[06:17] <xipietotec> mitrovarr: windows has a separate downloadable package that can make it read ext3
[06:17] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: how ?
[06:17] <nothlit> Specialbuddy, there is mozilla-plugin-vlc mozilla-mplayer and totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin but only try one at a time and remove the old one first
[06:18] <rawrness> I am afriad i shall leave gnome for i have goten beryl to work beter in kde
[06:18] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  i am a paying user...
[06:18] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: i seriously doubt that it's a MAC address problem, but it has similary symptoms
[06:18] <sethk> mitrovarr, ext2/3.  Windows drivers are available.  If you don't want to change windows, then fat32 is better because it can be written by both windows and linux
[06:18] <rawrness> So Farewell and Goodbye for all the fish
[06:18] <dfcarney> *similar
[06:18] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: again if i were you stay away from the firefox plugins for right now...the mediaplayerconnectivity plugin for firefox is awesome
[06:18] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: maybe they lost your last payment?
[06:18] <nothlit> Specialbuddy, i think you'll need w32codecs if you try to use the gstreamer plugin
[06:18] <vermyndax> gevaudan: well, it seems to be a cross between forwarding mails to an internal server vs. capturing
[06:18] <mitrovarr> xipietotec:  I know, I used to have it on my old computer.  Would getting that and using it work better than FAT32?  FAT32 has issues with large drives, and linux doesn't like running programs off of it.
[06:18] <roverr> ztg: and how do users access the site to upload content?  ftp into their homedir?
[06:18] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  it is a one time payment
[06:18] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: sudo aptitude purge flashplugin-nonfree
[06:18] <wheelswitch> site is still up
[06:18] <wheelswitch> and i can access it with online ftp clients etc
[06:18] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: thanks
[06:18] <xipietotec> mitrovarr: yes, ext3 is a much superior filesystem
[06:19] <Specialbuddy> gevaudan, do I get it online because I didn't find it on synaptic
[06:19] <xipietotec> it also never needs defragging
[06:19] <ztg> yes, they all have unique accounts
[06:19] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: search in google and install it that way..it's not in synaptec
[06:19] <wheelswitch> just not from my home machine, linux nor windows
[06:19] <Specialbuddy> oko
[06:19] <roverr> ztg: if you setup your ftp properly a user logging in as themself will only see their own home dir
[06:19] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: sorry, don't know. i've seen this kind of thing when the initial packet of the handshake was just dropped by the firewall
[06:19] <mitrovarr> xipietotec:  Thanks for the help, that was exactly what I was wondering.
[06:19] <slop|lap> question : what command shows what distro i am running?
[06:19] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: after flash 7 is gone, the new .so file goes in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins.  You will need to mv it as root.
[06:20] <mitrovarr> sethk:  thanks as well, I was planning on installing the ext3fs plugin anyway, so that should work fine
[06:20] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: but if you're a customer, definitely contact someone and complain :)
[06:20] <navaburo> kmitch87, what are you talking about
[06:20] <vermyndax> hmm looks like I fixed it
[06:20] <vermyndax> it was a procmail issue
[06:20] <navaburo> ook, flash
[06:20] <ztg> i'm using sftp using rssh
[06:20] <nothlit> kmitch87, the adobe script will do it as well
[06:20] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  ok, thanks alot for your time, appreciate it.
[06:20] <dfcarney> mister_roboto: i can't think of anything, unless some router (or remote site) is filtering based off of MAC address
=== subir is now known as subir|away
[06:20] <navaburo> i cant seem to get mozilla-mplayer working
[06:20] <navaburo> do i have to move a .so or something?
[06:20] <gevaudan> vermyndax: i want to say i deleted the home directories which are not being picked up by you pop3/imap daemon if that makes sense and then upon restarting postfix it defaulted to the right directory: /home/username/Mail
[06:21] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: have you tried connecting from a different computer?
[06:21] <gevaudan> navaburo: don't...use the mediaplayerconnectivity plugin for firefox...google it
[06:21] <GirlRiver> kmitch87: is there a way to run Ubuntu File Mgr as sudo or root ? (i'm a newb and need a gui)
[06:21] <dfcarney> wheelswitch: and, for kicks, try changing your MAC address.  i've seen that work for similar problems in the past.
[06:21] <gevaudan> kmitch87: yes, just type gksu before launching
[06:21] <nothlit> GirlRiver, you don't have to run it as root, you can put it in your ~/.mozilla/plugins folder
[06:22] <timfrost> wheelswitch: try tcptraceroute to the server.  Note that tcptraceroute is in Universe.
[06:22] <vermyndax> gevaudan: check /etc/postfix/main.cf
[06:22] <navaburo> gevaudan, WOW, thanks
[06:22] <vermyndax> gevaudan: it should say in there what dir is the default MailDir
[06:22] <kmitch87> GirlRiver: run sudo mv file.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
[06:22] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  yes, i have tried from the windows box upstairs, same router + connection, but it does not work
[06:22] <nothlit> GirlRiver, gksudo nautilus is the command to run the filemanager as root
[06:22] <dustin> hey how do i submit an error report?
[06:22] <vermyndax> gotta run
[06:22] <ixian_> has anyone tried easyubuntu on 6.10? does it work?
[06:22] <l337f00l> can anyone help me with installing an older version of Lame specifically Lame-3.90
[06:23] <Zer0Ry0k0> Is it easyer to run programs built for old windows or mac?
[06:23] <gevaudan> verymyndax: i agree, but i remember not changing that anywhere and leaving it as the default when i was running postfix on kubuntu...after deleting the directory, restarting postfix all was well...on ubuntu everything works outside of the box
[06:23] <roverr> ztg: sp then how does one user get access to another users files?  do you have a testcase that shoes it?
[06:23] <rbil> wheelswitch: why don't u give us the ftp addresses (without login of course) and let one of us try connecting?
[06:23] <mnepton> ixian_: EasyUbuntu and Automatix should be avoided on any release.
[06:23] <wheelswitch> rbil i have
[06:23] <wheelswitch> ftp.freepgs.com
[06:23] <Specialbuddy> so the mediaplayerconnectivity is a browser plugin
[06:23] <Specialbuddy> I hope it works
[06:24] <mister_roboto> rbil: works fine for me
[06:24] <mjbjr> I have a friend on the line and the dsl net connection has stopped working... modem lights are blinking (properly ?)... ifconfig shows eth0 is up... ping shows "host unreachable"... assuming verizon problem... some other thing to check before getting on the horn to verizon
[06:24] <mjbjr> ?
[06:24] <babo> how do I associate callto with skype in firefox ?
[06:24] <Zer0Ry0k0> What version of old software would be easier to run, windows or mac?
[06:24] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: it's kind of hard to explain but it works perfect for all media
[06:24] <roverr> ztg: if you have a problem i think you should solve it with your user access control to up and downloads.  not with fs and apache perms
[06:24] <dfcarney> mjbjr: have them cycle the interface, just in case:  "sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0"
[06:25] <mjbjr> thanks
[06:25] <Specialbuddy> do I have to download something else to view wmv
[06:25] <nothlit> Zer0Ry0k0, on ubuntu?
[06:25] <timfrost> wheelswitch: I can get to port 21 on ftp.freepgs.com, so the FTP server is running.  try tcptraceroute ftp.freepgs.com 21, to see where your blockage is.
[06:25] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: w32codecs if you haven't already
[06:25] <wheelswitch> timfrost:  ok, here goes...
[06:25] <Zer0Ry0k0> yes, on ubuntu
[06:25] <Specialbuddy> what player should I use for viewign
[06:25] <Zer0Ry0k0> I have WINE installed allready
[06:26] <ianmacgregor> Specialbuddy: Some WMV's will be unusable no matter what you do.
[06:26] <Zer0Ry0k0> is there a mac emulator or something I would need?
[06:26] <ztg> any good acl tutorials you know of?
[06:26] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: the PLF repository which allowed you to download using synaptec is down and no longer maintained :( it took me forever to find a debian package to do the same but it's out there
[06:26] <mister_roboto> mjbjr: i've seen that exact same problem on my cable modem when they were having a problem at my isp. usually recovers after  10 minutes or so. i always figured they had to reboot a router or something :)
[06:26] <mjbjr> been a day so far
[06:27] <Specialbuddy> I'm just trying to watch the fix on adultswim
[06:27] <xipietotec> gevaudan, Specialbuddy see Seveas' packages
[06:27] <gevaudan> Specialbuddy: my recommendation is to download vlc, realplayer, and xmms and use those in conjunction with the mediaplayerconnectivity plugin
[06:27] <xipietotec> !seveas
[06:27] <ubotu> Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:27] <firebird619> I'm the kubuntu-desktop package on Ubuntu Edgy. It has been stuck on Configuring kubuntu-docs. The PC is locked up except for moving the mouse. What is the best thing to do with it, restart?
[06:27] <roverr> ztg: i'd start with the apache docs, then make the content mgmt system enforce the user up/downloads possibly in conjunction with fs perms
[06:27] <zMott> I need to get libdvdread3 and libdvdcss anyone ?
[06:27] <dfcarney> timfrost: have you tried that command?  i'm trying it and all I'm getting is "* * *"
[06:27] <firebird619> *I'm installing the kubuntu-desktop package
[06:27] <gevaudan> xipietotec: noted, i'll keep this in mind next time i upgrade, thanks
[06:27] <nothlit> Zer0Ry0k0, i don't know of any mac emulation programs but you can emulate the whole os with xen or vmplayer or qemu
[06:28] <babo> how do I associate callto with skype in firefox ?
[06:28] <xipietotec> zMott: !seveas
[06:28] <zMott> ?
[06:28] <xipietotec> !sevease
[06:28] <xipietotec> !seveas
[06:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sevease - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:28] <roverr> ztg: personally i like cvs over ssh for content mgmt but that might be overkill for you
[06:28] <zMott> what is the u.deb

[06:28] <Zer0Ry0k0> nothlit: but would that be easy? and use less proscessor than WINE?
[06:28] <zMott> cool
[06:28] <zMott> because it looks like freecontrib is dead
[06:28] <nothlit> firebird619, you've been installing kubuntu INSIDE your X server ? (graphical interface)
[06:29] <nothlit> Zer0Ry0k0, definitely not
[06:29] <Zer0Ry0k0> nothlit: okay    =)
[06:29] <xipietotec> zMott: the ubuntu steam of PLF is gone until someone else takes up maintaining it
[06:29] <ztg> it's more of a traditional isp service
[06:29] <ztg> thanks for your help roverr
[06:29] <Specialbuddy> how about svideo
[06:29] <timfrost> dfcarney: yes.  For me , it takes 21 hops to the server.
[06:29] <gevaudan> i wonder how much maintenance it really requires...hell there were only like 12 packages inside it
[06:29] <roverr> later ztg
[06:29] <Specialbuddy> is there a way to do that with ubuntu?
[06:29] <zMott> k, then I will use seveas .deb
[06:29] <firebird619> nothlit: yes. It is so far into the install but it is locked up. I hate to lose all what its done, but I think thats the only option.
[06:29] <nothlit> firebird619, you could try ctrl+alt+f1 and login and type top and see if anything is actually going on
[06:29] <dfcarney> timfrost: do any addresses resolve for you, or is it just "* * *" ?
[06:30] <ianmacgregor> gevaudan: Do you know how to make proper Ubuntu packages?
[06:30] <Xzyx987X> ungh, this is driving me nuts. could someone please explain how to set up an entry in fstab to automatically mount a drive with read/write permissions for all users?

[06:30] <gevaudan> ianmacgregor: ubuntu packages? i know how to make debian packages but no ubuntu packages
[06:30] <nothlit> firebird619, whenever you try something ambitious with installations, use a virtual console (ctrl+alt+F1-4) or do it inside screen
[06:30] <gevaudan> navaburo: not sure
[06:31] <firebird619> nothlit: It doesn't do anything with ctrl+alt+F1.
[06:31] <nothlit> firebird619, but the mouse can move?
[06:31] <firebird619> nothlit: yes.

[06:31] <nothlit> firebird619, thats incredibly odd, i wouldn't know how to help you, you could leave it alone or ask someone who knows more
[06:32] <nothlit> firebird619, leave it alone (to see if it will complete) *
[06:32] <timfrost> dfcarney: yes, all the intervening addresses resolved.  See http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29503/
[06:32] <gevaudan> cheaman: try something like:  /dev/           /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0
[06:32] <nothlit> firebird619, have you set up ssh?
[06:32] <dfcarney> timfrost: thanks.  i'm curious to know why they don't resolve for me...
[06:33] <firebird619> nothlit: I used Synaptic and it shows in the terminal the last thing as being Setting up librsync1 (0.9.7-1)

[06:33] <Ashley`> When I try to Wine applications, the wine-pthread process goes into an uninterruptible sleep for all eternity. I think it's something to do with my sound hardware because winecfg will run until I click the "audio" tab. What should my next course of action be?
[06:33] <cheaman> gevaudan: what does?
[06:33] <Xzyx987X> ianmacgregor: well, it's an ntfs drive, which complicates things a bit
[06:33] <gevaudan> cheaman: what i posted
[06:33] <cheaman> ok?
[06:33] <firebird619> nothlit: I don't believe so, how do I know?
[06:33] <gevaudan> cheaman: ok
[06:33] <cheaman> how i put it in there?
[06:33] <Xzyx987X> here's what I had: /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 auto user,atime,auto,rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0
[06:33] <nothlit> firebird619, have you installed ssh? if you have you could possible ssh into your box and see if something is hanging your installation
[06:34] <xipietotec> essentially, never format floppy disks as NTFS in windows
[06:34] <Xzyx987X> that mounts it with read only permission for root and no permission for other users
[06:34] <nothlit> firebird619, oh, then only thing i know is ctrl+alt+backspace to restart the X server, but that will start your installation all over again since you started it in X
[06:34] <firebird619> nothlit: No, that isn't anything I installed myself. It just finally went to another console from when I pressed ctrl+alt+F1 a few minutes ago. What command should I enter there?
[06:34] <mister_roboto> 30 hops is the max it will look in traceroute, by default

[06:35] <Nomikos> anyone know how to get SSH support in php5?
[06:35] <cheaman> help :|
[06:35] <Ashley`> nothlit: I've had the X server hang like that and ctrl+alt+backspace no longer works either.
[06:35] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: increase the number of hops that traceroute will follow (-m argument)
[06:35] <Xzyx987X> because I can't set individual permissions on files as the drive is ntfs...
[06:35] <nothlit> firebird619, type top in and see the process taking up the most cpu cycles is
[06:35] <dfcarney> Xzyx987X: isn't the NTFS driver only read-only?
[06:36] <nothlit> Ashley`, thats what ssh is for :)
[06:36] <Specialbuddy> so playing windows media player 10 is not going to work on ubuntu most likely
[06:36] <dfcarney> Xzyx987X: or are you using an experimental driver with write support?
[06:36] <gevaudan> dfcarney: not if you follow the guide on ubuntuguide.org to enable r/w
[06:36] <dfcarney> gevaudan: gotcha
[06:36] <Nomikos> ah, think i found it..
[06:36] <phab> anyone got a link to enable the composite stuff?
[06:36] <firebird619> nothlit: I typed top as you said. Numbers are changing, etc. It must be doing something. What do I press to get back to the GUI to see if it is getting any farther. Looks like Xorg is taking up the most.
[06:36] <Xzyx987X> I thought they had write support in the default drivers...
[06:37] <timfrost> wheelswitch: you are about two hops from success when things stop.  I note that the first 3 hops are all private (RFC1918) address space, so I wonder where your address is translated to a routable address.  If your ISP isn't doing the NAT properly, that could explain the problem
[06:37] <gevaudan> Xyz987: nope
[06:37] <nothlit> firebird619, to get back into your x interface you press ctrl+alt+f7
[06:37] <Xzyx987X> ok, but either way, even if I can't get write support without experimental drivers for all users, how about just read support?
[06:37] <evilmegaman> does anyone know how to have window borders when using beryl?
[06:37] <nothlit> firebird619, but if Xorg (your x server) is the process that has hanged, i don't think you have a choice but to start all over again
[06:38] <Xzyx987X> in the manager right click on the tray icon and set the manager to beryl
[06:38] <wheelswitch> i guess i contact my host (freepgs) and see what they say, it is really important i have ftp access for my site it has river data updated daily on it.
[06:38] <nothlit> firebird619, because you have to terminate X and thats what you installation depends on
[06:38] <nothlit> firebird619, but the good news is, apt-get will only need to finish reinstalling the new programs and won't have  to redownload anything
[06:38] <nothlit> firebird619, anything it has already set up will be fine
[06:38] <gevaudan> wheelswitch: can't you just use scp instead of ftp? unless you are allowing anonymous ftp i'd stick with scp
[06:38] <xipietotec> evilmegaman: I have that problem, close beryl-manager
[06:38] <firebird619> nothlit: Ok. I can't tell if its getting any further. Half the screen is black, the bottom half is the bottom half of the GUI.
[06:39] <xipietotec> your borders should come back

[06:39] <Xzyx987X> sometimes it gets set to compiz, wich causes the issue
[06:39] <nothlit> firebird619, that means X is still hanging
[06:39] <mister_roboto> timfrost: that's a very good point! where are those 10. addresses coming from? the isp?!

[06:40] <nothlit> firebird619, id try leaving it alone for a while then, nothing has hanged, your computer may still be doing something
[06:41] <BHSPitLappy> GirlRiver, do you have flash 9?
[06:41] <timfrost> mister_roboto, wheelswitch, I assume the 10.x are the ISP that wheelswitch is using (transact.com.au?).
[06:41] <nothlit> GirlRiver, are you sure you have installed flash 9? got to a flash website that you know works, right click on the flash applet and see about flash player # to check which version there is

[06:41] <Lam_> what's the %u in firefox %u stand for?
[06:42] <wheelswitch> timfrost:  that is indeed my isp
[06:42] <mister_roboto> timfrost: you're right though that it's clearly broken since those are non-routeable
=== Cre[a] tiveEmb[a]  is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[06:42] <gevaudan> Lam_: user profile i think
[06:42] <dfcarney> timfrost: aren't 10.0.0.0. to 10.255.255.255 reserved private networks?
[06:42] <Lam_> gevaudan: ok thanks
[06:42] <nothlit> firebird619, yeah, thats why its always better to use a virtual console (ctrl+alt+f1-f4) ... also go to help.ubuntu.com/community and search for the SSHHowTo guide
[06:43] <l337f00l> can anyone help me with installing an older version of Lame specifically Lame-3.90
[06:43] <dfcarney> timfrost: i.e. reserved addresses for private networks?  just a guess on my part, but some switches/routers may be selectively blocking or filtering out packets NATed through them.
[06:43] <nothlit> firebird619, that way you can use your other computer to login and manage it if it freezes
[06:43] <BHSPitLappy> what the heck
[06:43] <firebird619> nothlit: I have Beryl installed and running (all the effects are amazing), will that work in KDE once the KDE install finishes without further configuration. I will have to remember to use a virtual console next time.
[06:43] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: what happens if you try a traceroute to someplace you CAN get to? do you still go through those 10.x.x.x addresses?
[06:43] <BHSPitLappy> I come back from work, and my desktop has apparently hung. black screen, monitor won't reactivate.
[06:43] <BHSPitLappy> buggy edgy.
[06:43] <nothlit> Lam_, i think it stands for the url variable another program can pass to it
[06:43] <troopa> What was the name of the Ubuntu package that had all of the multimedia codecs? easybutu or something like that.
[06:43] <BHSPitLappy> easyubuntu
[06:44] <Lam_> nothlit: ok that one makes more sense. thanks
[06:44] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: like www.google.com?
[06:44] <troopa> Thanks.
[06:44] <timfrost> dfcarney: yes they are.  Either wheelswitch has 3 devices before the ISP, or else the ISP is using non-routable addresses on their internal network.
[06:44] <AdamKili> when i first upgraded to Edgy, it said that my X Keyboard settings and my GNOME keyboard settings were different and it needed to know which i wanted to keep, i said to keep the X settings and to not show the message again. but now my right ALT button doesn't work, it recognises it as <Mod5> in System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts. any way to fix?
[06:44] <nothlit> firebird619, kde is compatible with beryl, but you may have to do some configuring to get it working
[06:44] <nothlit> firebird619, there is guides for it on help.ubuntu.com
[06:45] <nothlit> firebird619, i don't use kde on this particular computer so i can't tell you its compatibility with beryl
[06:45] <nothlit> firebird619, out of box
[06:45] <AdamKili> troopa: easyubuntu is right, but it never worked for me
[06:45] <firebird619> nothlit: Ok. I will just let it sit and hope it does something. I periodically hear the HDD working, which it wasn't doing before when I come here for help, so hopefully it is finishing up.

[06:46] <GirlRiver> nothlit: I do not get an option to see help about on any page regardless of whether it loads or not
[06:46] <dfcarney> timfrost: interesting...  but why aren't they routable?  i mean, i use 192.168.2.x as my private network and my packets are routed properly.  what do you think the difference is in this case?
[06:46] <firebird619> nothlit: If I would have to restart X, what would I do to get it to finish what it has left of KDE, instead of starting from the beginning?

[06:47] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  sorry, didnt see that, trying tracerout one google now

[06:48] <nothlit> GirlRiver, did you copy the .so file to ~/.mozilla/plugins ?
[06:48] <gevaudan> l337f00l: if you can find it just compile from source..../configure && make && make install
[06:48] <nothlit> GirlRiver, and restart firefox?
[06:48] <firebird619> nothlit: Ok, great. Thanks for the help. I will just let it keep running, and hope it works without having to do that, but if I do have to restart, I'll know what to do. :-)
[06:48] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: it's fine on your LAN

[06:49] <rocky> anyone have a favourite gnome/flickr app that runs on edgy?
[06:49] <mister_roboto> dfcarney: not sure offhand which it is. but something has to do NAT before such packets can get to an external network
[06:49] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  yes, traceroute www.google.com still brings up the 10.***.* addresses
[06:49] <l337f00l> gevaudan: can I private message you the error because it is long

[06:55] <wheelswitch> as in "open ftp.blah.com" or "open <ftp.blah.com>"?
[06:55] <mister_roboto> gevaudan: actually, it works by the server establishing the listening port and telling the client what it is, rather than the reverse
[06:55] <gevaudan> l337f00l: honestly, it's hard to tell from the stacktrace you posted

[06:58] <akijikan> I don't know?  just the i386 dsic on the download page...never used ubuntu before
[06:58] <nothlit> akijikan, you can try to legacy/compatibility mode in the boot options or if that doesn't work use the alternate install disc instead
[06:58] <nothlit> akijikan, its the second option
[06:59] <GirlRiver> nothlit: umm, yes I think so
[06:59] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  thanks alot for all your time, i guess ill wait and see what my webhost says

[06:59] <wheelswitch> mister_roboto:  hopefully they will just give me scp access
[06:59] <nothlit> AdamKili, did you restart afterwards?
[06:59] <dfcarney> akijikan: for reference, that error message is coming from X -- the window server.  It means that it cannot locate configuration information for your video card and/or monitor (typically in a file called XF86Config-4)
[07:00] <mister_roboto> wheelswitch: that would be a good thing
[07:00] <BHSPitLappy> akijikan, they were just asking if you were booting to the CD, or if you'd already installed ubuntu and are using the installation
[07:00] <nothlit> GirlRiver, well once you've pasted the file close firefox, open it up again, and then go to a flash site that you know worked before
[07:00] <GirlRiver> nolith: no, i don't :-)

[07:04] <dfcarney> akijikan: i.e. how old is it?  make/model?  type of CPU?  do you know any details about it?
[07:04] <ZirJoker> is there any gba emulator for ubuntu?

[07:05] <AdamKili> thanks nothlit
[07:05] <matt_> is there an easy way to get s-video working on ubuntu
[07:06] <ltr^^^_> i installed mplayer, trying to play a video file  - error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device
[07:06] <dfcarney> akijikan: yeah, it seems pretty new
[07:06] <GirlRiver> nothlit: no
[07:06] <dfcarney> akijikan: the first thing i recommend you do is find out if there's support for your video card in Linux
[07:06] <GirlRiver> nothlit: I never ran the gksudo thingy
[07:07] <akijikan> dfcarney: okie-dokie, thanks
[07:07] <matt_> why is it so hard to get s-video working under ubuntu
[07:07] <akijikan> dfcarney: I did install and run FC6 okay on this machine, so I tend to believe there is
[07:07] <nothlit> GirlRiver, thats incredibly odd, well then if you've executed the two mkdir commands try navigating to ~/.mozilla/plugins again and pasting the flashplayer .so file in again
[07:07] <GirlRiver> nothlit: can I clarify something ...  the folder should be in /home/girlriver/.mozilla/plugins
[07:08] <nothlit> GirlRiver, well yes, if your username is girlriver
[07:08] <dfcarney> akijikan: i'm not sure how the installation CD works exactly, but the other suggestion by nothlit is a good one -- try and boot it in a reduced video mode
[07:08] <dfcarney> akijikan: i'm guessing you're getting that error because your video card isn't supported yet
[07:08] <GirlRiver> nothlit: ok .. i will now go and make the directories
[07:09] <nothlit> AdamKili yw :)
[07:09] <akijikan> dfcarney: reduced mode? is that a boot commandline option like noapic?
[07:09] <nothlit> AdamKili you can try to go through the reconfiguring process again to get the windows key going
[07:09] <nothlit> AdamKili part of it is GNOME's defaults however
[07:10] <dfcarney> akijikan: to be honest, i don't exactly know.  it's been a long time since i installed Ubuntu :)
[07:10] <bucky> how do I add virtual desktops to my gnome panel after upgrading to 6.10
[07:10] <nothlit> akijikan, no its simply one of the options you are presented with before you boot into a graphical environment with the livecd
[07:10] <nothlit> akijikan, it should be the second
[07:10] <dfcarney> akijikan: i would guess that the installation CD gives you a menu when booting
[07:10] <bucky> i only have two now as opposed to the normal four
[07:10] <nothlit> bucky, right click on the virtual desktops
[07:10] <akijikan> there is a grapical safemode or something like that but I get the same error
[07:11] <nothlit> bucky, click preferences and up the number.
[07:11] <bucky> tnx
[07:11] <bucky> awsome ease of upgrade
[07:11] <nothlit> akijikan, you can always try using the ALTERNATE boot cd instead, it uses no graphical environment so it may be slightly more confusing, but there are guides on how to use it
[07:12] <GirlRiver> nothlit: ok .. /.mozilla already exists without a plugins directory BUT it does have a firefox and firefox1.0.x.ubuntu folder in it
[07:12] <nothlit> akijikan, its pretty similar to the regular installer, with a few more hardware options and things like LVM
[07:12] <arepie> i have one problem when trying to remove software through synaptic, the error is --> E: clamav-base: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
[07:12] <nothlit> GirlRiver, look inside the firefox folder, there may be a plugins folder in that
[07:12] <Andruk> hello, when my computer starts up i get an x server error. i have already looked around and i cannot find any helpful howtos, faqs or guides that tell me how to fix it. the error is failed to load module "ati", no drivers were found, and no screens were found. i can get to a command prompt. can anybody help me?  i am using edgy (upgraded from dapper)
[07:13] <nothlit> GirlRiver, try pasting it in there then (btw great investigative work :)
[07:13] <akijikan> nothlit: okay, I'll give it a whirl, thank you very much, you too dfcarney

[07:14] <Lathiat> tich: hrm im not sure one is supposed to
[07:14] <Lathiat> tich: does it automatically ask if you want to play it when you insert it?
[07:15] <nothlit> GirlRiver, go ahead and make the plugins folder in the root .mozilla folder and put it in there
[07:15] <pppoe_dude> tich, audio disks shouldn't mount iirc
[07:15] <ltr^^^_> i installed mplayer, trying to play a video file  - error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device
[07:15] <nothlit> GirlRiver, the fact that you're missing a plugins folder is odd, i haven't even used firefox and i have it
[07:15] <tich> ppoe_dude, what is iirc?
[07:16] <pppoe_dude> ltr^^^_, try mplayer -vo xv <file> instead of whatever you were doing.
[07:16] <nothlit> GirlRiver, you can also try copying it into the /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins folder once you start a root filebrowser
[07:16] <tich> Lathiat, no it does ask but if i open rhythmbox it appears right below my library

[07:16] <pppoe_dude> tich, audio disks are not mountable (no filesystem) and hence will not be mounted to a specific directory
[07:17] <dfcarney> tich: IIRC stands for "if i recall correctly"
[07:17] <nothlit> ltr^^^_, open up mplayer from the menu, then right click in the center of the video window, click preferences
[07:17] <pppoe_dude> tich, however, media players, CD rippers, etc. will be able to detect/play them
[07:17] <tich> why do dvd's appear on the desktop and cd's don'd
[07:18] <tich> *don't?
[07:18] <pppoe_dude> tich, dvd's are data disks
[07:18] <nothlit> ltr^^^_, click the video tab, and try those until you get one that works, remembering to restart mplayer in between each try
[07:18] <nothlit> ltr^^^_, i had the same problem before
[07:18] <tich> well now i know.
[07:18] <mythril> how do I install phpmyadmin (via apt) on ubuntu-server (6.10)?
[07:18] <tich> pppoe_dude, thanks
[07:18] <pppoe_dude> tich, dvd's iirc are mountable
[07:19] <nothlit> tich,  iirc is If I Recall Correctly
[07:19] <bayzider> Does any one know?
[07:19] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, are you on edgy?
[07:19] <bayzider> What is "edgy"?
[07:19] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, what distro are you using?
[07:19] <sev_> he's probably not then
[07:20] <Gumby> any mysql users in here?  running mysqld in dapper and it all of a sudden is failing to start and I cant figure out why.
=== sev_ is now known as sevtastic
[07:20] <bayzider> Im on the new one dapper or w/e 6.06 theres a new one?
[07:20] <nothlit> bayzider, make sure you have the other ubuntu repositories added then sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[07:20] <sevtastic> hey guys
[07:20] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, you need to install flashplugin-nonfree from the multiverse repo
[07:20] <dusk> I just installed edgy, and followed the direction to install fglrx drivers from ubuntu, how do I check (and fix) the error I am getting (detailed as a common error on this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[07:20] <sevtastic> can someone direct me in the right path to using compiz on nvidia with amd64?
[07:20] <bayzider> ok lemme check if I have it
[07:21] <bayzider> but whatsedgy?
[07:21] <sevtastic> i've got beryl going but it's kinda spotty
[07:21] <pppoe_dude> sevtastic, #ubuntu-xgl
[07:21] <_array> hey guys, where is the screen resolution file kept? not the xrog.conf, the resolution only changes for one user on my box and I can't see anything so I need to set it back to the right resolution.. its user specific
[07:21] <mike_> Ok I got the codecs for all of my players but when I try and play over network ti says it can't read source any idea what I am missing?
[07:22] <matt_> there needs to be a better way for getting dual monitor and s-video
[07:22] <pppoe_dude> _array, did you select the correct default depth and res in xorg.conf?
[07:22] <_array> pppoe_dude: It works fine in 1024x768 but its all fuzzy in 800x600.. now I can't boot into x and set it back because I can't see
[07:22] <bayzider> Is edgy a new distro or something?
[07:23] <compudaze> no
[07:23] <compudaze> it's the new version of ubuntu
[07:23] <compudaze> edgy is the codename for ubuntu 6.10
[07:23] <nothlit> _array, system -> preferences -> screen resolution
[07:23] <bayzider> pppoe_dude: I have that installed, but still I cant see some flash things.
[07:23] <pppoe_dude> _array, screen res in X is controlled by xorg.conf
[07:23] <_array> nothlit: ..I can't see in X
[07:23] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, you probably need the more recent flash plugin which is not available
[07:24] <bayzider> pppoe_dude : ='( when will it be?
[07:24] <_array> pppoe_dude: it boots into gdm with 1024x768, just when I log into my account it goes into 800x600
[07:24] <pppoe_dude> _array, if u want, run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg if u feel unfomfortable fiddling with text files
[07:24] <mike_> compudaze I can't play music on my ubuntu from my file server. I can get to the file but it won't read the source any ideas?
[07:24] <nothlit> _array, oh you mean for one gnome user profile?
[07:24] <Lathiat> bayzider, pppoe_dude: there is now a flash 9 beta out for linux
[07:24] <pppoe_dude> _array, oh i see..
[07:24] <_array> nothlit: yes!!
[07:24] <mnepton> oh man. "unfomfortable." what a great word.
[07:24] <Lathiat> bayzider, pppoe_dude: seveas' ubuntu respostiroy has an updated package for it
[07:24] <nothlit> _array, you could try using gconf in another user
[07:24] <duane> anyone know how to install flash in opera and konqueror?
[07:25] <bayzider> Lathiat: How do I get it?
[07:25] <mnepton> duane: i believe Opera has a tutorial on their site
[07:25] <Madpilot> duane, just use the Flash installer from Macromedia, it should find all your browsers
[07:25] <_array> nothlit: getting "gconf: command not found"
[07:25] <pppoe_dude> !seveas>bayzider
[07:25] <Lathiat> !seveas>lathiat
[07:25] <Lathiat> interesting
[07:25] <shinobi2> anyone got wireless working?
[07:25] <duane> mnepton: do you know where it is?
=== jimwhimpey is now known as RandyWalker
[07:25] <pppoe_dude> _array, run gnome-display-properties using sudo for a different user
[07:26] <duane> Madpilot: i downloaded a zip file from them. there was no installer
[07:26] <bayzider> pppoe_dude: how do I know what one I want?
[07:26] <pppoe_dude> _array, sude -u <username> gnome-display-properties
[07:26] <nothlit> _array,  gconf-editor ... its actually under applications system tools but its hidden until you edit the menu
[07:26] <pppoe_dude> _array, above should work and fix things
[07:27] <nothlit> _array, oh, pppoe_dude knows better than me :)
[07:27] <moj0rising> hello! does anyone know if it is possible to use SATA RAID while using an on-board controller?
[07:27] <bayzider> pppoe_dude: What one do I get?
[07:28] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, i don't know, i don't use dapper
[07:28] <moj0rising> instead of a PCI expansion card RAID controller
[07:28] <pppoe_dude> bayzider, try searching for all 'flash' and pick flash9 or somethn
[07:28] <nothlit> duane, you have to add the commercial repository or the opera repository but if you used edgy, you have to use the Dapper commercial repository to install opera
[07:28] <mnepton> duane: http://www.opera.com
[07:28] <mnepton> duane: GIYF, too :)
[07:28] <pppoe_dude> Lathiat seems to know about it, bayzider
[07:29] <duane> mnepton: im looking at opera.com right now. i searched for a tutorial and cant find it
[07:29] <nothlit> duane, theres a guide on how to install opera in help.ubuntu.com/community , just search for opera
[07:29] <duane> nothlit: i have opera installed im trying to install the new flash for opera and konqueror
[07:29] <bayzider> lathiat: How do I get the respatory ?
[07:29] <_array> pppoe_dude: gave me a Connection to ":0.0" refused by server
[07:29] <bayzider> Like im on the page but I dont know what to do now
[07:29] <pppoe_dude> _array, are you doin that from another gnome session?
[07:30] <_array> pppoe_dude: yes
[07:30] <mnepton> duane: http://www.opera.com/linux/docs/plugins/install/  <--- ~15 seconds on Google
[07:30] <nothlit> duane, i don't know about konqueror but just place the so in ~/.opera/plugins
[07:30] <pppoe_dude> _array, try gksudo -u <user> instead
[07:30] <duane> mnepton: u da man
[07:31] <_array> same thing
[07:31] <_array> :(
[07:31] <pppoe_dude> _array, ? are you in a terminal with the original user?
[07:31] <pppoe_dude> s/original user/session user
[07:31] <_array> pppoe_dude: I dont thik so
[07:31] <_array> lemme check
[07:33] <pppoe_dude> _array, oh i may be wrong actually... maybe gnome-display-properties needs to connect
[07:33] <_array> pppoe_dude: I just logged out of everything
[07:33] <_array> pppoe_dude: and its still not working
[07:33] <firebird619> nothlit: It is still installing KDE, to my knowledge anyway, I am in a virtual console and now I can't switch back to the GUI. Do you think I should continue waiting or what?
[07:33] <pppoe_dude> _array, gimme 1 sec
[07:33] <_array> pppoe_dude: oaky dude, thanks again
[07:34] <Andruk> nothlit: i apologize, i wasnt searching with the right terms.  i found a guide and its working great!  thank you so much!
[07:35] <nothlit> firebird619, use ps aux | less and look for anything with apt-get or aptitude, or synaptic and see if anythings going on
[07:35] <nothlit> Andruk,  :D
[07:35] <pppoe_dude> _array, if the above doesnt work... i just suggest you comment out the troublesome resolution in xorg.conf and restart X.
[07:35] <Andruk> does anybody know a keyboard command for getting a terminal up (and then starting a window exnvironment - right now all my windows are on the upper left)
[07:36] <pppoe_dude> _array, that way, X will revert to the default resolution
[07:36] <nothlit> firebird619, actually just use ps aux | grep <name of utility used to install here>
[07:36] <khermans_> has anyone implemented/researched a System Restore feature yet for Ubuntu?
[07:36] <nothlit> Andruk, startx ?
[07:37] <mckinnoj> Arg! I followed the step by step instructions at "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI" for installing ATI proprietary drivers on Edgy but my OpenGL renderer is still Mesa
[07:37] <ltr^^^_> nothlit, which one did you use
[07:37] <khermans_> would be relatively simple -- backup /etc/ and user dot files
[07:37] <ArrenLex> khermans_: sure. It's called "tar -cjf /" =P
[07:37] <khermans_> ArrenLex, i mean for dumb users
[07:37] <nothlit> khermans_, theres plenty of ways to backup on linux, partimage, rsync, simple tar, even mondo rescue, you can create a live cd(s) which will restore your setup automatically
[07:37] <khermans_> ArrenLex, novices don't kow how to click 'tar'
[07:38] <khermans_> nothlit, of course
[07:38] <khermans_> nothlit, i mean something easy to use like System Restore
[07:38] <nothlit> khermans_, but no system restore, the closest thing linux has to a registry is gconf and ive always been under the impression that system restore is useless
[07:38] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, i can see no purpose for that
[07:38] <khermans_> i use partimage all the time, but that is not a "smart" file modification detection service
[07:38] <nothlit> khermans_, i think theres a  simple backup utility created during the google summer of code, lemme look
[07:39] <firebird619> nothlit: How is it I exit from top? I accidently got back into that, must have hit the up arrow or something and didn't realize it.
[07:39] <nothlit> firebird619, type q
[07:39] <khermans_> nothlit, yeah i saw it on the wiki -- but never got implemented
[07:39] <xipietotec> .tar.gz /etc. confused me looking at the extension, but the box icon was easy enough to understand as some sort of compressed file
[07:39] <firebird619> nothlit: says unknown command-try 'h' for help.
[07:40] <pppoe_dude> nothlit, esc
[07:40] <firebird619> nothlit: h switches from Show Threads on and Show Threads off
[07:40] <ArrenLex> How is Flash 9 working for everyone? Any recurring issues?
[07:40] <nothlit> firebird619, hitting q doesing work?
[07:40] <Werdna> hey all
[07:40] <firebird619> nothlit: no :(
[07:40] <dany> hi!
[07:40] <khermans_> pppoe_dude, even like -> Grandma chooses to perform an upgrade of Linux -- but it dies halfway through -- now wants to boot into a recovery mode and restore to last checkpoint
[07:40] <pppoe_dude> oops
[07:40] <nothlit> firebird619, the letter Q as in queen, not H as in hopping
[07:40] <pppoe_dude> firebird619, esc
[07:40] <Neil3> ArrenLex, how did you install flash 9? did a package get backported?
[07:41] <khermans_> Neil3, labs.adobe.com
[07:41] <Neil3> ah
[07:41] <Werdna> After upgrading from Dapper to Edgy, my wireless card (using ndiswrapper) and KDE don't work anymore. I get the error in syslog: loadndisdriver: main(638): version 1.7 doesn't match driver version 1.8
[07:41] <ArrenLex> Neil3: from macromedia labs.
[07:41] <firebird619> pppoe_dude: esc doesn't work either. Says Unkown command.
[07:41] <Neil3> cheers
[07:41] <mckinnoj> Has anyone successfully installed the proprietary ATI drivers using the guide at "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI" on Edgy?
[07:41] <ArrenLex> macromedia -> adobe. *old school*
[07:41] <pppoe_dude> firebird619, ctrl-c
[07:41] <khermans_> Neil3, copy the .so file
[07:41] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: what card?
[07:41] <firebird619> pppoe_dude: great, that worked, thanks
[07:41] <khermans_> Werdna, compile ndiswrapper from source
[07:41] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, use something to make iso images
[07:41] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: Radeon 9800 pro
[07:41] <khermans_> pppoe_dude, iso of what?
[07:41] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, of your disk
[07:41] <Neil3> ahh its beta i think i'll wait ;)
[07:41] <khermans_> pppoe_dude, thats useless too
[07:42] <Neil3> thanks anyway folks
[07:42] <nothlit> khermans_, i believe sbackup was complete but the wiki was vandalised several times
[07:42] <khermans_> pppoe_dude, i mean for novices -- like it automatically makes check points along the way
[07:42] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, well... if you're upgrading, you should always expect something wrong to happen
[07:42] <nothlit> khermans_, completed*
[07:42] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: could you kindly paste the output of lspci | grep AT?
[07:42] <ArrenLex> |grep ATI **
[07:42] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, you have a point, but it would be too complicated for a very narrow field of applications
[07:42] <khermans_> pppoe_dude, i mean like a few packages, not a dist-upgrade
[07:42] <firebird619> nothlit: It finds one entry for Synaptic, which is what I used. What am I looking for in that entry to know if it is doing anything?
[07:43] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, you can downgrade packages
[07:43] <nothlit> khermans_, i see sbackup in the repositories
[07:43] <pppoe_dude> khermans_, and always do 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' to revert
[07:43] <nothlit> firebird619, what are you looking for?
[07:43] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R350 [Radeon 9800 Pro] 
[07:43] <mckinnoj> 01:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R350 [Radeon 9800 Pro]  (Secondary)
[07:43] <khermans_> nothlit, nice
[07:43] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: are you certain that card's not supported by the opensource driver?
[07:43] <nothlit> khermans_, theres also something called simplebackup in the repositories, dunno what that is
[07:44] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: I think it might be.
[07:44] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: I believe that it is, but I was under the impression that I needed the proprietary software to use hardware acceleration
[07:44] <pppoe_dude> _array, did that last thing work?
[07:44] <firebird619> nothlit: I guess what I mean is, after entering that command to search for entries to do with the program I used to install KDE, does just the fact that it found an entry mean it is still doing something (installing KDE) or what?
[07:44] <khermans_> nothlit, hrrrrr -- but it needs to be transparent
[07:44] <khermans_> nothlit, i might have to write this thing myself ...
[07:45] <nothlit> firebird619, what number is in the first column?
[07:45] <nothlit> khermans_, oh, as in automatic? can't you schedule rsync or something in cron then?
[07:45] <Abst> Suddenly my sound has stopped working  and I dont have a clue why
[07:45] <Abst> Tried restart
[07:45] <Abst> !sound
[07:45] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure alsa is selected by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (Alsa Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, then look at http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems
[07:45] <nothlit> firebird619, i mean third column
[07:46] <firebird619> nothlit: 0.2
[07:46] <khermans_> nothlit, of course any veteran linux user can do backups any number of ways
[07:46] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: no; there is experimental 3D support for R300 cards. In my experience, it is very functional, stable, and far better than the official drivers. If your card gets 3D acceleration with the radeon driver, I advise you to use it, since fglrx was coded by a blindfolded intern typing randomly into notepad as part of an initiation dare.
[07:46] <nothlit> firebird619, that should be the cpu usage, if its extraordinarily high or low then there might not be anything going on
[07:46] <khermans_> nothlit, i mean to provide a transparent layer that does it for the dumb user, and when a problem happens, they can do something like revert to snapshot
=== foolswisdom is now known as fool|Zzz
[07:46] <hyphenated> ArrenLex: haha blindfolded intern
[07:46] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: upgrade to edgy. Then, try booting X with the "radeon" driver. See if you get 3D acceleration.
[07:46] <khermans_> nothlit, but it would only handle system files, not user files
[07:47] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: lol, good description of the ATI development process
[07:47] <ArrenLex> Abst: please run the "amixer" command and pastebin teh output.
[07:47] <firebird619> nothlit: Beings it is so low, is that a good sign that it is still installing.
[07:47] <nothlit> firebird619, i think stopping and starting your install all over again is a worthwhile thing to pursue, you wont have to redownload anything, and apt-get/aptititude will remember what has been installed or configured anyways
[07:47] <Abst> ArrenLex: Ubotu fixed it, but thanks anyway
[07:47] <nothlit> firebird619, at least then you know whats going on
[07:47] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex:  Sorry, I'm still a n00b here.  How would I tell X to boot with the "radeon" driver?
[07:48] <nothlit> khermans_, lol i know of no such thing, file something in launchpad?
[07:48] <ArrenLex> mkinnoj: have you upgraded to edgy?
[07:48] <firebird619> nothlit: Ok, what do I enter to do that, I can get back to the GUI now, but still half black, half GUI.
[07:48] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: yeah, I've upgraded to edgy
[07:48] <nothlit> firebird619, you can type sudo reboot or ctrl+alt+del (just like windows ;)
[07:48] <khermans_> mckinnoj, sed -i 's/Driver .*/Driver "radeon"/' /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:48] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: I did a clean install actually
[07:49] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: please paste the output of     cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver | grep -v "kbd" | grep -v "mouse"
[07:50] <ArrenLex> khermans: hold up there! Won't that replace his mouse and keyboard drivers as well?
[07:50] <firebird619> nothlit: Ok, entered ctrl+alt+del and it's now rebooting. Once thats done I just enter sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, right?
[07:50] <khermans_> ArrenLex, well yeah dont do it ... lol
[07:50] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: Driver      "wacom"
[07:50] <mckinnoj>         Driver      "wacom"
[07:50] <mckinnoj>         Driver      "wacom"
[07:50] <mckinnoj>         Option      "VendorName" "ATI Proprietary Driver"
[07:50] <mckinnoj>         Driver      "ati"
[07:50] <mckinnoj>         Driver      "fglrx"
[07:50] <khermans_> ArrenLex, .* should be replaced with current driver
[07:51] <nothlit> firebird619, thats correct it should continue, tell me if there are any errors, sometimes dpkg doesnt like it if you terminate it
[07:51] <ianmacgregor> khermans_: That's going to change Driver "kbd", Driver "mouse" too
[07:51] <ArrenLex> ...
=== zaatar is now known as Gazoz
[07:51] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: that is very surprising. Would you kindly pastebin your entire /etc/X11/xorg.conf file? I want to take a look at it.
[07:51] <firebird619> nothlit: It has KDE as a choice in the Select Session, does that mean anything?
[07:51] <khermans_> yeah he has two cards?
[07:51] <nothlit> firebird619, but i recommend using aptitude for your package management, that way if/when you uninstall anything it will also automatically uninstall the dependencies
[07:51] <nothlit> firebird619, does it say gdm/kdm?
[07:51] <nothlit> firebird619, tell me what it says
=== Gazoz is now known as zaatar
[07:52] <firebird619> nothlit: In te Select Session it says KDE. I also have the options of Last Session, Default System Session, GNOME, Failsafe GNOME, and Failsafe Terminal.
[07:52] <firebird619> *the
[07:53] <nothlit> firebird619, oh, that just chooses what graphical environment you want when you log in
[07:53] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: also, please describe your system, including number and type of video cards and number and type of input devices, including mice, keyboards, tablets and touchpads.
[07:53] <nothlit> firebird619, gnome is what ubuntu normally uses, and kubuntu uses kde
[07:53] <nothlit> firebird619, i think it is defining the default, but it doesn't really matter, because you can choose from the login manager just before you log in
[07:54] <firebird619> nothlit: Yes, I am aware of that, I was just wondering if beings it was listed as a choice if it was completely installed?
[07:54] <rwscold> hey anyone know anything about xgl or whatever with dapper?
[07:54] <nothlit> firebird619, you're doing this all from the virtual console right?
[07:54] <tarelerulz> Does ubuntu have anything like tom's windows manager
[07:54] <ArrenLex> rwscold: Are you asking what it is? Or how to install it?
[07:54] <^Gecko^> wow
[07:54] <jake102> can anyone help me.. when I try to copy a text file into floppy I get this error...  cp: cannot create regular file `/media/floppy/cms.txt': Read-only file system
[07:54] <nothlit> firebird619, no, usually it presents these options before most of the installing is finished
[07:54] <^Gecko^> I can hardly believe it
[07:55] <ArrenLex> rwscold: in the first case, I advise you to pursue wikipedia; in the second, #ubuntu-xgl
[07:55] <jake102> can anyone help me.. when I try to copy a text file into floppy I get this error...  cp: cannot create regular file `/media/floppy/cms.txt': Read-only file system
[07:55] <rwscold> well xgl is what makes the wobble and what not right
[07:55] <nothlit> firebird619, just see if you can get to the end where you can type things into your console again
[07:55] <firebird619> nothlit: I am going to run the sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop from virtual console so I don't run into the same problem.
[07:55] <ArrenLex> jake102: how did you mount the floppy?
[07:55] <ArrenLex> jake102: also make sure the floppy isn't write-blocked.
[07:55] <^Gecko^> A linux install that recognizes both my gigabit onboard nic and my PCI wifi card
[07:55] <nothlit> firebird619, ok sure
[07:55] <rwscold> arren i want to install it i have used a couple of how tos but dont know exactly where to start i read about beryl and aiglx and xgl and compiz and i really dont know
[07:56] <ArrenLex> Gecko: your gigabit nic has a free driver now, so many or most distributions will recognise it.
[07:56] <jake102> arrenlex: I dont know
[07:56] <^Gecko^> FC6 didnt
[07:56] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: 1 video card - Radeon 9800, usb mouse, standard keyboard, Audigy 2 soundcard
[07:56] <^Gecko^> it's a IC Plus IP1000
[07:56] <^Gecko^> and my wifi card is a Netgear WG311T
[07:56] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: okay. Pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf please.
[07:56] <ArrenLex> !pastebin
[07:56] <Andruk> anybody know how to start a window manager
[07:56] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[07:56] <^Gecko^> 2*
[07:57] <ArrenLex> Andruk: start which?
[07:57] <jake102> arrenlex: I dont know
[07:57] <xipietotec> ^Gecko^: ubuntu has great hardware detection
[07:57] <ArrenLex> jake: explain the process from picking the floppy up from the table to getting that error on the screen.
[07:57] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: Which WM? It should have installed an entry into gdm.
[07:57] <^Gecko^> Andruk:  try startx
[07:57] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: Forgive my ineptitude, do I need to dl a plugin to pastebin?
[07:57] <khermans_> mckinnoj, no
[07:57] <khermans_> mckinnoj, just paste your code there
[07:57] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: of course not; it's a website with a big text box. You paste text into this box and it uploads it and gives you a link which you share here.
[07:58] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: it's so your huge pastes don't flood the channel, is all
[07:58] <^Gecko^> This is my first time using x-chat, how do I open connections to more servers?
[07:58] <Andruk> Gecko: didnt work, x is already started
[07:58] <khermans_> ^Gecko^, /server
[07:58] <mckinnoj> ah ok, one sec
[07:58] <ArrenLex> Andruk: what are you trying to start?
[07:58] <^Gecko^> khermans_:  will that close this connection or open a second?
[07:58] <nothlit> Andruk, try pressing ctrl+alt+f7
[07:58] <Andruk> ArrenLex ianmacgregor: dont know, how do i check?
[07:59] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: You don't know which WM you installed?
[07:59] <Andruk> oh
[07:59] <Andruk> well, i didnt install it, edgy/dapper did.  but it is metacity
[07:59] <Andruk> so, how do i start metacity?
[07:59] <jake102> arrenlex so u cant help me?
[07:59] <ArrenLex> Andruk: using the metacity command. Doesn't it start automatically?
[07:59] <nothlit> metacity --display :1
[07:59] <nothlit> err
[07:59] <nothlit>  :0
[07:59] <ArrenLex> jake102: did you answer my question?
[07:59] <Andruk> ArrenLex: no
[07:59] <jake102> yes
[07:59] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: Metacity is the default WM in gnome, If you're running gnome, then MC is already running
[07:59] <Werdna> I'm trying to install the latest ndiswrapper, but it wants kernel headers and I don't have them, and I don't have wireless connection. How can I get the kernel headers without an internet connection?
[08:00] <ArrenLex> jake: explain the process from picking the floppy up from the table to getting that error on the screen.
[08:00] <ArrenLex> jake: sorry, I've missed it; please paste it again.
[08:00] <jake102> I said I dont know how I mounted the floppy
[08:00] <khermans_> where is Grumpy Groundhog release?
[08:00] <ArrenLex> jake102: and I said: (00:00:06) ArrenLex: jake: explain the process from picking the floppy up from the table to getting that error on the screen.
[08:01] <Madpilot> khermans_, there is no such thing
[08:01] <jake102> wtf
[08:01] <ArrenLex> khermans: the which what now?
[08:01] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: okay...so i have the top and bottom panels, but what about the window toolbars?
[08:01] <khermans_> ubotu, grumpy groundhog
[08:01] <nothlit> Andruk, metacity --display :0  you can also add --replace in there if you think somethings going on
[08:01] <jake102> someone said I need to edit /etc/fstab mount option
[08:01] <khermans_> Madpilot, the wiki documents it
[08:01] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: sorry, pastebin seems to be taking a while
[08:01] <rwscold> ANyone know how i can install xgl/beryl/compiz or whatever that makes the windows run sort of like a mac the "wiggle"
[08:01] <nothlit> Andruk,  the top and bottom panels are gnome-panel, window borders are metacity
[08:01] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: then try using www.pastebin.ca
[08:02] <Andruk> right...
[08:02] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: Metacity doesn't really have many tweaks. There are a few tweaks in System -> Preferences -> Windows, but that's it. If you have titlebars on your window, then Metacity is running.
[08:02] <Madpilot> khermans_, it's the "rolling release" bleeding edge 'release'; it's been talked about but AFAIK doesn't actually exist
[08:02] <Andruk> nothlit, thank you.
[08:02] <ArrenLex> rwscold: the #ubuntu-xgl channel exists to help you with that.
[08:02] <rwscold> 'thanks
[08:02] <khermans_> Madpilot, hrmm .. interesting
[08:02] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: thats the thing, i do not have any windows borders and the windows just keep piling up in the upper left hand corner ;-)
[08:03] <Werdna> !headers
[08:03] <ubotu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[08:03] <ArrenLex> Madpilot: so, grumpy groundhog == sid?
[08:03] <Werdna> okay, what if I don't have an internet connection
[08:03] <nothlit> Madpilot, so its ubuntu's debian testing? or is it more unstable thanthat
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[08:03] <ArrenLex> Andruk: what happens if you launch a shell in X and run "metacity" with no further options?
[08:03] <Madpilot> ArrenLex, nothlit - it's something that's been talked about for a while, but never actually happened.
[08:04] <nothlit> Andruk, try typing metacity --display :0 --replace  in a virtual console
[08:04] <Andruk> rwscold
[08:04] <Andruk> rwscold: #ubuntu-xgl
[08:04] <khermans_> ArrenLex, no Grumpy Groundhog =~ Binary Gentoo
[08:04] <timalot> anyone know how to get a laptop lcd screen to turn off after a certain amount of inactivity (ie after the screensaver has been on for a while)? ... currently on my machine it blanks then screen but the lcd is still on...
[08:04] <nothlit> Madpilot, yes but i just wanted to know what i theoretically entailed
[08:04] <ArrenLex> Isn't binary gentoo an oxymoron?
[08:04] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: http://pastebin.ca/230359
[08:04] <khermans_> ArrenLex, no -k option to emrge gets binaries
[08:04] <Madpilot> nothlit, "bleeding edge of everything", basically
[08:04] <ArrenLex> khermans: I'm not familiar with gentoo.
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> timalot, when you close yours, does the lcd stay turned on
[08:04] <khermans_> ArrenLex, you can do binary mode installs in gentoo
[08:04] <nothlit> ArrenLex, lol it is but there are whole repositories for it
[08:05] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: keep in mind that I added that last Section "Extensions" following the instructions of that guide
[08:05] <khermans_> Madpilot, seems like it would be much work to build all packages daily
[08:05] <nothlit> Madpilot, ahh, thank you :)
[08:05] <timalot> BHSPitLappy: when i close the lid it turns off... but sometimes i forget to do this ...
[08:05] <Andruk> i cant get a freaking terminal opened!  they try to start up but they just disappear off of the bottom bar!
[08:05] <Madpilot> khermans_, from what little I've read, Grumpy would depend on autobuild utils that don't exist yet, hence Grumpy  not existing yet
[08:05] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: how exactly did you end up with this file? What tools did you use?
[08:05] <BHSPitLappy> timalot, when I close mine, the lcd turns off, but a few seconds/minutes? later it turns back on, for the screensaver or some dumb reason.  Causes the laptop to overheat if I go somewhere.
[08:06] <khermans_> timalot, look at /etc/acpi/lid.sh
[08:06] <veleno> hello everyone. i've just installed edgy..impressive. i have a problem with my logitech mouse (mx518). the mouse wheel doesn't work properly (i only get it working in th bottom-up direction, not the opposite)
[08:06] <BHSPitLappy> really unacceptable (and stupid) behavior
[08:06] <rwscold> !xgl
[08:06] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL)  -  Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager  -  Help in #ubuntu-xgl  -  See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[08:06] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: also, how important is it to you? May I suggest backing it up and reconfiguring X from scratch? It's very esoteric.
[08:06] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: You can ALT+click and drag anywhere in a window to move that window around with the mouse
[08:06] <Chippy> Andruk: are you trying to run xinemara?
[08:06] <timalot> khermans_: exactly but how do i get that to run? after a specified time
[08:06] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: no, i cant
[08:06] <BHSPitLappy> ianmacgregor, re-read and re-think the original comment
[08:07] <BHSPitLappy> Andruk, use a different terminal
[08:07] <Andruk> Chippy: no
[08:07] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: um, I found out about the existence of this file today, and I only added that last section
[08:07] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: I have no idea how the rest was generated
[08:07] <khermans_> timalot, a hack would be to symlink xscreensaver to it ;-)
[08:07] <ianmacgregor> BHSPitLappy: ?
[08:07] <Andruk> BHSPitLappy: I have tried others, which do you suggest?
[08:07] <Keyseir> anybody know of software I could easily make a wav/mp3 file that's Completely Blank with?
[08:07] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: yes, it's very convoluted. No objections to remaking it?
[08:07] <khermans_> Keyseir, libmp3
[08:07] <timalot> khermans_: might have to that :) .... ill keep looking for a bit
[08:07] <mckinnoj> ArrenLex: Sounds fine to me
[08:07] <khermans_> Keyseir, or audacity
[08:08] <firebird619> nothlit: When I entered sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop it said No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed. Does that mean it completely installed KDE and its done?
[08:08] <Keyseir> khermans_ thanks
[08:08] <khermans_> timalot, /etx/acpi/screenblank.sh
[08:08] <ianmacgregor> BHSPitLappy: Are you telling me that ALT+click and drag doesn't work if the wm isn't running?
[08:09] <mcquaid> I just noticed that in 'users and groups' the checkbox to 'show all users' is now gone, is there another way to display this?
[08:09] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: im sure it doesnt
[08:09] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: :(
[08:09] <BHSPitLappy> ianmacgregor, I'm telling you that you completely missed the topic of the question. comment. whatever you call it.
[08:09] <mcquaid> I assume this is not ubuntu's doing, but gnome's in making it minimal they are removing features they already had
[08:09] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: this command will back up that file and then reconfigure your X server. The default values should be fine for you unless you know you need to use something different. Remember to read through every screen just in case. Make sure to pick the "radeon" driver if it asks! After you run this, restart X.
[08:09] <MorphDK> is there a proper way to upgrade to Gaim 2.0.0b4 ? The MSN via HTTP part is not working in b3..
[08:09] <ArrenLex> mckinnoj: sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak && sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:10] <ianmacgregor> BHSPitLappy: I did not
[08:10] <khermans_> MorphDK, try compiling from source
[08:10] <rwscold> arren should i try beryl or compiz (nobody is  in that cahnnel hah)
[08:10] <ArrenLex> firebird: yes; kubuntu is installed.
[08:10] <ArrenLex> rwscold: actually, there are 113 people in it.
[08:11] <rwscold> arren they all seem to be afk
[08:11] <MorphDK> khermans_, okay.. just thought of the easiness with a *.deb package..
[08:11] <capi> Hejsan
[08:11] <firebird619> ArrenLex: Ok, Thanks. The PC locked up again though. The mouse moves but everything else is locked. When I started the PC the borders of the windows were flickering off and on constantly.
[08:11] <Andruk> ianmacgreor: my window manager (metacity) is not working.  i have been trying to open a terminal and manually start it, but i cannot start a terminal
[08:11] <capi> Hello
[08:11] <khermans_> MorphDK, compiling from source is easy too!
[08:11] <rwscold> arren just thought u might have a suggestion
[08:12] <BHSPitLappy> ianmacgregor, yeah..... you did.
[08:12] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: Ok, my bad.. I didn't realise your wm wasn't working.
[08:12] <etern> ok, i need help with partitions acting weird after upgrading to efty
[08:12] <ArrenLex> rwcold: beryl is less stable but with more plugins, compiz is more stable but with less plugins. Beryl might be somewhat easier than compiz to install.
[08:12] <etern> anyone please?
[08:12] <BHSPitLappy> ianmacgregor, gnome-terminal won't start (it crashes while starting), so the solution is to MOVE the window? (into existence???)
[08:12] <rwscold> ok thanks arren
[08:12] <khermans_> etern, in what way?
[08:13] <khermans_> BHSPitLappy, i have seen that before, try rebooting -- i know thats not the answer you want to hear
[08:13] <khermans_> BHSPitLappy, i dont know the proper fix
[08:13] <ArrenLex> Andruk: press ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a virtual console. Log in as normal user. Run "metacity --display :0" and then press ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to X. See if it helps.
[08:13] <mcquaid> Anyone else find it kind of annoying when features are removed with each upgrade?
[08:13] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: np...any other ideas?
[08:13] <etern> khermans_, i installed my main storage devices after installing efty, and now they are listed as NTFS partitions, though they were ext3 last night before upgrading
[08:14] <mcquaid> Shared folders lost a few features and so did users and groups
[08:14] <etern> installed as in physically installed
[08:14] <khermans_> etern, what does gparted say?
[08:14] <ArrenLex> mcquaid: perfect, easy, automatic ... choose one.
[08:14] <khermans_> etern, or fdisk ?
[08:14] <ArrenLex> one -> two * xD
[08:14] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: No, I don't use Metacity in gnome.. so can't help any further.
[08:14] <Andruk> ArrenLex: doesnt work
[08:14] <Andruk> np
[08:14] <mcquaid> heh
[08:15] <etern> khermans_, "HPFS/NTFS"
[08:15] <pibarnas> even with "build-essentials" installed I can't compile gtk-engine on edgy amd64! How can I do that?!
[08:15] <Andruk> ianmacgregor: np, thanks for your help!
[08:15] <mcquaid> how bout, if it ain't broke don't fix it
[08:15] <ArrenLex> Andruk: "doesn't work" is hard to troubleshoot. WHAT doesn't work?
[08:15] <khermans_> etern, is it REALLY ext3?
[08:15] <khermans_> etern, then just set the part type id
[08:15] <etern> khermans_, , yep
[08:15] <etern> 100%
[08:15] <BHSPitLappy> khermans_, err, it wasn't me...
[08:15] <khermans_> etern, fdisk /dev/hd? t 82
[08:16] <Andruk> ArrenLex: I apologize, when i click the terminal icon on the top panel bar, it appears to start up on the bottom panel bar, but the terminal never appears
[08:16] <khermans_> etern, sorry choose your patition numebr and set to type 83
[08:16] <ArrenLex> Andruk: did you follow my instructions?
[08:16] <Andruk> ArrenLex: yes
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[08:16] <ArrenLex> Andruk: they do not include clicking any terminal icons. Where does this factor in?
[08:17] <^Gecko^> what the
[08:17] <etern> khermans_, sorry, how?
[08:17] <Andruk> ArrenLex: i tried your instructions, i tried clicking my launch icons, and neither of them worked
[08:17] <khermans_> etern, sudo fdisk /dev/hda
[08:17] <Andruk> ArrenLex: I apologize for not giving you all the information
[08:18] <ArrenLex> Andruk: did you get any errors when you ran "metacity --display :0"?
[08:18] <KenSentMe> Since a few days (edgy update) i get an error when i start Ubuntu: [17179577.968000]  usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -71. Any ideas where i should look for solving it?
[08:18] <BHSPitLappy> heh, that's hilarious
[08:18] <Deaigo> i have a usb hdd mounted
[08:18] <Deaigo> i run a php script
[08:18] <Andruk> ArrenLex: I didn't get that far, i cannot launch a virtual terminal
[08:18] <khermans_> KenSentMe, does it matter to startup?
[08:18] <Andruk> lol
[08:18] <timfrost> Andruk: can you go to a text window (CTRL-ALT-F1), log in, and check whether metacity is actually running.  ' ps ax | grep metacity' should report something like ' 7422 ?        Ss     1:08 /usr/bin/metacity --sm-client-id=default0'
[08:19] <Deaigo> but then all of a sudden the whole disk is read-only
[08:19] <Deaigo> !!!!
[08:19] <Fracture> is it possible to install edgy into a lvm root partition ? it's not working for me.
[08:19] <Rothguard> Edgy Eft here i come
[08:19] <ArrenLex> Andruk: I don't think you followed them very well. You seem to be confused about what a virtual terminal is. I didn't ask you to launch a terminal emulator.
[08:19] <KenSentMe> khermans_: what do you mean? It looks like my startup hangs a bit at this point
[08:19] <ArrenLex> Andruk: read carefully: press ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a virtual console. Log in as normal user. Run "metacity --display :0" and then press ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to X. See if it helps.
[08:19] <Andruk> why do you guys not understand this?  when i try to open a virtual terminal or click my terminal launch icon, nothing happens.  i cannot get into terminal
[08:20] <Andruk> ArrenLex: I am pressing that.  I can do that.  ;-)
[08:20] <khermans_> Andruk, i told you to try rebooting -- because i saw this before -- and dont know the proper fix
[08:20] <ianmacgregor> Andruk: Nothing happens when you press CTRL+ATL+F1?
[08:20] <ArrenLex> Andruk: because the only possible way ctrl+alt+f1 won't make anything happen is if your system is frozen.
[08:20] <Andruk> no
[08:20] <etern> khermans_, now what?
[08:20] <Andruk> well, i can move the mouse
[08:20] <rm_you> anyone know how to make the standard ubuntu boot screens come back after I installed kubuntu-desktop? >_>
[08:20] <ArrenLex> Andruk: if this is the case, then alt+sysrq+s,alt+sysrq+u,alt+sysrq+b to reboot.
[08:20] <Andruk> ill try rebooting
[08:21] <khermans_> type p
[08:21] <khermans_> etern, fdisk is useful for changing partiton settings
[08:21] <Andruk> rebooting...
[08:21] <Andruk> lol
[08:22] <babo> anyone know where I can ask a voip/sip question ?
[08:22] <etern> khermans_, ok, but how do i change it.. none of the commands says exactly "change partitions settings"
[08:22] <khermans_> etern, t
[08:22] <nothlit> ArrenLex, lol i've had ctrl+alt+f1 and ctrl+alt+backspace not work with X frozen but sshing into the machine till worked
[08:22] <khermans_> etern, then enter partition number you want, followed by 83
[08:23] <etern> khermans_, ok, so i just type t 83 now? did i understand you correctly? :)
[08:23] <Chippy> nothlit: that happened to me all the time while getting beryl up and working
[08:23] <ArrenLex> nothlit: at that point, I would just say "system is down" and reboot =P
=== pez is now known as punkforpez
[08:23] <Andruk> yes, my system was definitely not frozen, i just couldnt do anything
[08:23] <khermans_> etern, t -> ??? -> 83
[08:23] <nothlit> ArrenLex, its still rescue-able XD! you can preserve your precious uptime lol
[08:24] <khermans_> etern, i can't magically determine what partition should be type 83 from across the internet for you
[08:24] <ArrenLex> nothlit: not my precious uptime, I turn my computer off when I don't need it. xD
[08:24] <khermans_> etern, dump the current layout with 'p'
[08:24] <nothlit> ArrenLex, :O lool
[08:24] <ArrenLex> alex@ubuntu:/tmp/gnash$ uptime
[08:24] <ArrenLex>  00:24:27 up
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Oooooh. Aaaah. =P
[08:24] <ArrenLex> 2:40
[08:24] <ArrenLex> *can paste* xD
[08:24] <Andruk> very nice
[08:24] <Andruk> lol
[08:25] <ArrenLex> Which reminds me, I was compiling gnash...
[08:25] <ArrenLex> I kind of forgot. xD
[08:25] <Andruk> well hallelujah
[08:25] <Andruk> seems a simple reboot did the trick...now lest try ctrl+alt+f1
[08:25] <Brutally_Murdere> hey
[08:25] <khermans_> Andruk, didn'ti tell you that like an hour ago?
[08:26] <lg> hello
[08:26] <troopa> Has anyone else got the error in 6.10 while trying to install where X fails and just says "no screens found".
[08:26] <ArrenLex> !hi
[08:26] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:26] <lg> i am trying to install compiz on a t42
[08:26] <troopa> It looks like a bunch of directories are missing.
[08:26] <ArrenLex> troopa: you're using the wrong driver, then.
[08:26] <ArrenLex> troopa: or that.
[08:26] <lg> what does it mean when apt give: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
[08:26] <lg> ?
[08:26] <ArrenLex> troopa: what happens if you try apt-get install xserver-xorg x-window-system-core
[08:26] <Andruk> khermans_: you prolly did, but i was too busy trying to ctrl+alt+f1
[08:26] <khermans_> lg, apt is in use by another process
[08:26] <Flannel> lg: it means you should close whatever other package managers youre running and try again
[08:26] <troopa> I can't acces anything.
[08:26] <ArrenLex> lg: it means you're trying to use apt-get as a normal user.
[08:26] <rm_you> lg: either you aren't root, or another package manager is running >_>
[08:26] <ArrenLex> lg: use root.
[08:27] <troopa> I am trying to install Ubuntu when this happens.
[08:27] <Andruk> khermans_ sorry ;-)
[08:27] <lg> but im not running any other?
[08:27] <ArrenLex> troopa ... oh.
[08:27] <lg> ..
[08:27] <troopa> It happens shortly after selecting the first option in the boot menu after I boot from the CD.
[08:27] <lg> i think
[08:27] <towsonu2003> troopa, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop might fix the issue
[08:27] <ArrenLex> troopa: what video card do you have?
[08:27] <khermans_> lg, if not coule be left over, delete it and retry
[08:27] <troopa> tow: How could I get a terminal to issue the command?
[08:27] <ArrenLex> lg: superuser.
[08:27] <rm_you> lg: are you running apt as root? (sudo or from a root console)
[08:27] <etern> khermans_, so if it is "hdb1" i should do "t hdb1 83"?
[08:27] <troopa> ArrenLex: Ati Radeon X700
[08:28] <ArrenLex> troopa: how new is that?
[08:28] <khermans_> etern, no fdisk is interactive
[08:28] <troopa> I looked at the X output and it detects my card alright.
[08:28] <lg> yes, typed sudo :) already figured that :)
[08:28] <khermans_> etern, sudo fdisk /dev/hdb
[08:28] <towsonu2003> troopa, once X spits you out, it should throw you to a terminal. but you can also hit alt+ctrl+f1 and login there
[08:28] <ArrenLex> troopa: oh. That's weird, I don't know, then.
[08:28] <lg> so i just need to add: deb http://xgl.compiz.info/ edgy aiglx-edgy main-edgy to /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[08:28] <etern> khermans_, already did that, now it says "Command (m for help):"
[08:29] <khermans_> etern, yes no type p
[08:29] <troopa> tow: This happens while I am trying to install ubuntu.
[08:29] <khermans_> etern, 'p'
[08:29] <Andruk> ArrenLex, khermans_, ianmacgregor, BHSPitLappy, nothlit, Chippy, timfrost, ^Gecko^    thank you
[08:29] <troopa> So I wouldn't even have an account to log into.
[08:29] <etern> khermans_, p, got it
[08:29] <ArrenLex> troopa: you can always install ubuntu in text mode if you want...
[08:29] <lg> khermans_: delete what?
[08:29] <khermans_> lg,  the lock file
[08:29] <ArrenLex> Andruk: not sure how I helped but you're welcome! :)
[08:29] <khermans_> etern, now see which are marked NTFS
[08:29] <jerome__> hi. X crash on my laptop when I close the display, trying to suspend (with Edgy). THis used to work at least once in a while before. Where do I report the bug ? I cannot find which package to report the issue in launchpad, Bugs links is always greyed out...
[08:30] <troopa> Arren: The only options I get are Install Ubuntu, Install in safe graphical mode, verify cd , test memory and boot from hard disk.
[08:30] <kraut> moin
[08:30] <Lynoure> troopa: I think the screen thing is a known bug, at least it is for X600...
[08:30] <etern> khermans_, it lists nothing, only disk size and heads, cylinders and stuff
[08:30] <troopa> Lynoure: Any known workarounds?
[08:30] <ArrenLex> troopa: yes. You'll have to download the alternate CD to install in text mode.
[08:30] <khermans_> etern, so no partitions are defined?
[08:30] <Zer0Ry0k0> jerome__: did you install your videocard drivers?  just making sure
[08:30] <etern> khermans_, guess not, there was before i started fdisk
[08:31] <lg> deleted the file, now i get: GPG error: http://xgl.compiz.info edgy Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
[08:31] <khermans_> etern, dont think so
[08:31] <Andruk> ArrenLex: trying is half the battle.  and you were willing to deal with my frequent inadeqate responses.
[08:31] <towsonu2003> troopa, the livecd also have the alt+ctrl+f1 thing like an installed system
[08:31] <MorphDK> okay, I installed Gaim 2.0.0b4 from source - it stille doesn't work, so how do I remove the files again?
[08:31] <lg> and the same message about the lock file
[08:31] <khermans_> etern, fdisk only writes changes if you use the 'w' command
[08:31] <etern> khermans_,  it said "/dev/hdb1   *           1        9732    78172258+   7  HPFS/NTFS" now its empty
[08:31] <Lynoure> troopa: hmm, it's this bug I thought of: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/35601
[08:31] <nothlit> Andruk, lol what were you trying to fix again ?
[08:31] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: define "doesn't work".
[08:31] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, can't connect to MSN via HTTP..
[08:32] <ArrenLex> I've always thought the topic for every help channel should contain "DOESN'T WORK IS NOT SUFFICIENT" in capital letters...
[08:32] <jerome__> Zer0Ry0k0: I think I have my drivers... Otherwise how could I be able to boot ?
[08:32] <nothlit> MorphDK,  make uninstall
[08:32] <_array> I just apt-get install gcc but it didn't do any of the #include libraries, is there a package for these?
[08:32] <jerome__> Zer0Ry0k0: (into X)
[08:32] <towsonu2003> troopa, but in the liveCD, as long as you are sure the CD is not corrupt, issue sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose vesa when it asks you to choose a driver. then I think startx should start X for you. have a look at the bug link Lynoure sent above though.
[08:32] <MorphDK> nothlit, nice one ;) thank you
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[08:32] <nothlit> _array,  aptitude install build-essentials
[08:32] <khermans_> _array, what libe?
[08:32] <lg> i get the feeling i am doing something wrong...
[08:32] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: works for me in beta 3.
[08:32] <lg> something with the keys
[08:32] <_array> nothlit: thanks buddy :)
[08:33] <lg> do i need to add anythign else other then the line in /etc/apt/sources/list

[08:33] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, what server settings are you using?
[08:33] <jerome__> Here's the X crash stack trace: http://pastebin.ca/230389 It doesn't seem driver specific...
[08:33] <nothlit> _array, sorry its essential without the s
[08:33] <towsonu2003> vpol, hehehe (he's not gonna like that)
[08:34] <_array> nothlit: Okay awesome, that worked
[08:34] <elhaxxorz> I know this does not belong on here, but can someone direct me to somewhere i can get help on epsxe in ubuntu?
[08:34] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: messenger.hotmail.com, 1863, use HTTP method
[08:34] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, you need the BIOS bin?
[08:34] <Zer0Ry0k0> jerome__: do you have a nVidia video card?
[08:34] <ArrenLex> , use global proxy settings
[08:34] <timfrost> _array you also need to install the build-deps for the package
[08:34] <jerome__> Zer0Ry0k0: yes...
[08:34] <MorphDK> doesn't work :(
[08:34] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, no, i can't select my control pad plugin
[08:35] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: anything unusual about your setup?
[08:35] <khermans_> _array, if it fails during ./configure or make, you need the *-dev files
[08:35] <Zer0Ry0k0> you should read this page... lemme find it
[08:35] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, every time i do, it crashes when i click on ext game pad
[08:35] <khermans_> _array, if it fails during linking, you need the lib* files
[08:35] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, latest version?
[08:35] <elhaxxorz> yeah
[08:35] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, dunno
[08:36] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, can i give you the output?
[08:36] <jerome__> Zer0Ry0k0: there a page on the wiki: NvidiaLaptop... something but as I said, suspend used to work on 6.06. Now X crashes. That's bad.
[08:36] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, no it's a default 6.10 install..
[08:36] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, try
[08:36] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: I meant about your network.

[08:36] <aum> what a way to be forced to upgrade from dapper to edgy! suspend2 messing up and almost destroying my main partition, just barely managed to backup my homedir before the partition flaked completely
[08:36] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, oh yes, port 80 and 443 is the only port I'm allowed to use..
[08:37] <totall_6_7> does anyone know of a good download manager that will split downloads
[08:37] <Zer0Ry0k0> jerome__: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[08:37] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, but that worked fine in gaim 1.x
[08:37] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: well that would be it, then!
[08:37] <ArrenLex> Hmm. I don't know.
[08:37] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: If you've installed from source, ask for help on #gaim. They're a very helpful bunch provided you're patient.
[08:38] <ArrenLex> MorphDK: Make sure to start with the fact that your network is unusual!
[08:38] <nacer> hi someone know about use 1 keyboard with 2pc ?
[08:38] <MorphDK> ArrenLex, okay..

[08:38] <Zer0Ry0k0> nacer: Get a KVM switch
[08:38] <nacer> software way
[08:38] <troopa> Is it possible to edit my xorg.conf durring installation?
[08:38] <Flannel> nacer: SSH/XDMCP
[08:39] <nacer> nop
[08:39] <troopa> Or will I have to download another CD (since I don't even have it installed to access anything)
[08:39] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, done
[08:39] <nacer> its a way to connect to xfree with etwork like dualscreen
[08:39] <Zer0Ry0k0> nacer: I don't see how you could do it through software
[08:39] <towsonu2003> troopa, no, you can either modify the xorg.conf of the liveCD sesiion while it's runing, or that of your installed system...
[08:39] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, try running again
[08:39] <nacer> 2 xfree
[08:39] <ArrenLex> troopa: it doesn't boot even in safe graphics mode?
[08:39] <troopa> Nope.
[08:39] <Zer0Ry0k0> nacer: yeah, the only way would be to connect through the terminal stuff
[08:39] <elhaxxorz> same
[08:39] <Flannel> nacer: that's XDMCP
[08:40] <nacer> Flannel, a i dont think its xdmcp
[08:40] <nacer> Flannel, its more low level
[08:40] <troopa> X won't start, at all. I am using the 6.10 release (64-bit)
[08:40] <nacer> in xfree
[08:40] <troopa> I just downloaded it tonight.
[08:40] <towsonu2003> troopa, what exactly happens when you hit ctrl+alt+f1 after X failed to start?
[08:40] <bahadir> goodmorning all
[08:40] <bahadir> I got a small q
[08:40] <ArrenLex> Wow. I haven't seen the word "xfree" in so long. Oh, the memories...
[08:40] <bahadir> I need to delete all emails of a user
[08:40] <jerome__> Zer0Ry0k0: thanks but I passed that step long time ago... I am now only searching how to report the crash. I cannot seem to report it on https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy/i386/x11-common/1:7.1.1ubuntu6 so where should I report it ?
[08:40] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, you restarted epsxe?
[08:40] <elhaxxorz> yeah
[08:40] <Flannel> nacer: we haven't used Xfree since Warty, just so you know.
[08:40] <bahadir> cld you pls tell me how can I empty the store folder
[08:40] <bahadir> ?
[08:40] <bahadir> postfix
[08:40] <troopa> tow: Will that even work considering this all happens *before* I can install Ubuntu?
[08:40] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, is this package installed ? psemu-drive-cdrmooby
[08:41] <elhaxxorz> it crashes and that is that i get, khermans_

[08:41] <Zer0Ry0k0> jerome__: ah,  =)   I'm still learning also, so I don't know the rest of what you need to know
[08:41] <troopa> 1. Burned ISO 2. Booted 3. Selected to Install 4. X failed to load
[08:41] <nacer> Flannel, i want to say xfree or xorg :)
[08:41] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, no can i use apt to get it
[08:41] <KenSentMe> How can i run a certain command in another language (e.g. english) for debugging?
[08:41] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, yes
[08:41] <nacer> i am a old men i continue to say xfree for X
[08:41] <etern> khermans_, if i do "for i in /dev/[hs] d[a-z] ; do sudo fdisk -l $i; done" in the terminal it lists the NTFS partitions, but in fdisk it lists nothing on the disks
[08:41] <Flannel> nacer: right, but they're different.  And, if you already know what you want, why are you asking about it?
[08:42] <rwscold> HEy anyone here how can i make sure xgl is running before i try and install beryl?
[08:42] <nacer> Flannel, i know its exist but dont remember the name
[08:42] <ianmacgregor> Flannel: /me smells a troll
[08:42] <towsonu2003> troopa, yes, the liveCD acts like an installed ubuntu system
[08:42] <khermans_> etern, try cfdisk
[08:42] <towsonu2003> troopa, pls type my whole nick, that's how your mesages get flagged for me to see easier
[08:42] <troopa> I don't have a LiveCD.
[08:43] <troopa> Nor do I wish to download one if I can avoid it.
[08:43] <^Gecko^> yeah
[08:43] <etern> khermans_, cfdisk ?? or just cfdisk?
[08:43] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, still the same
[08:43] <towsonu2003> troopa, I'm a little confused... which cd are you trying to use to install?
[08:43] <nothlit_> troopa, sometimes people have huge issues with installation simply because the download or the burning processing wasn't perfect, did you md5hash and verify your disk?
[08:43] <Flannel> troopa: you have the Desktop CD, right?  that's a liveCD
[08:43] <khermans_> etern, sounds weird
[08:43] <troopa> I verified the CD using the option from the bootmenu.
[08:43] <khermans_> etern, is this a laptop?
[08:43] <troopa> It had 0 checksums fail
[08:44] <khermans_> etern, are there any weird hidden partions, like a restore partition?
[08:44] <^Gecko^> I installed the nvidia binary driver, ran sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[08:44] <^Gecko^> restarted x
[08:44] <troopa> I use ubuntu-6.10-desktop-64
[08:44] <etern> khermans_, nope, but hey, you seem to be a little busy now, this could wait a while and i'll check back later, thanks for trying anyway :)
[08:44] <^Gecko^> and it crashed x with some error saying it can't find the device
[08:44] <khermans_> etern, is it a thinkpad with pre-boot area
[08:44] <timfrost> KenSentMe: try 'LANG=en <command>'
[08:44] <towsonu2003> troopa, desktop cd is the same as a liveCD
[08:44] <SoftIce> hello, please can somebody tell me if im on edgy how do I downgrade php
[08:45] <SoftIce> or do I have to install from source?
[08:45] <Flannel> SoftIce: downgrade to what?
[08:45] <AdamKili> !restricted
[08:45] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:45] <troopa> Well, when I boot up all I see are options to install. So, wait for X to fail again (for installation) and press ctrl+alt+F1?
[08:45] <SoftIce> Flannel: earlier version of php5
[08:45] <SoftIce> not 5.1 it has major issues with alot of my apps
[08:45] <towsonu2003> troopa, yes
[08:45] <khermans_> etern, gparted does it in a GUI
[08:45] <troopa> Alright, when I do that what should happen?
[08:45] <towsonu2003> troopa, then login at the screen you are presented with and then type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:45] <^Gecko^> wow there are a lot of users in here
[08:45] <khermans_> SoftIce, you could pin the version with apt
[08:46] <troopa> Alright.
[08:46] <towsonu2003> troopa, when it asks you to choose a driver, select vesa
[08:46] <SoftIce> khermans_ I cant find jus version 5
[08:46] <towsonu2003> troopa, when all is done, restart x with the command startx
[08:46] <Flannel> SoftIce: then you'll need to compile from source, yeah.  5.1 was in Dapper too, you know
[08:46] <khermans_> SoftIce, use the source
[08:46] <^Gecko^> I feel lucky I was able to get xwindows working again nwithout having to reinstall from scratch
[08:46] <towsonu2003> troopa, this should fix the liveCD. once the system installs, you may have to do the same thing after booting to your *installed* system -done -hope this helps
[08:46] <^Gecko^> which wouldn't have been that big of a deal
[08:47] <silentdis> hello
[08:47] <troopa> Thanks for the help.
[08:47] <troopa> Sorry for the confusion. I will give this a shot.
[08:47] <^Gecko^> troopa: you'll have to press enter and tab>enter a lot when you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:47] <^Gecko^> but you'll be able to choose whatver driver you need, and resolution too
[08:47] <towsonu2003> troopa, you're most welcome, hope it fixes the issue -don't forget to check the bug report link someone posted a little above
[08:48] <noelferreira> hi people, who can help me with rt61 wireless driver in edgy?
[08:48] <^Gecko^> oops

[08:49] <towsonu2003> Milchmann, nvu
[08:49] <Milchmann> thx
[08:49] <noelferreira> help with rt61 wireless driver please!
[08:49] <towsonu2003> :)
[08:50] <mnepton> Milchmann: Amaya?
[08:50] <silentdis> help!  fresh install of dapper, all patches applied.  installed the nvidia-glx driver, enabled it, reconfigured x to use it, and rebooted.  X won't start now, and gives a "no screens found" error in the logs.  what am I doing wrong?
[08:50] <Milchmann> thx, will try that one too
[08:50] <^Gecko^> silentdis: i got the same error
[08:50] <nothlit_> towsonu2003, wouldn't sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart be better than startx, i assume he will normally use a login manager
[08:50] <^Gecko^> silentdis: in a console type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:51] <towsonu2003> Milchmann, amaya may be better -nvu has problems with standards
[08:51] <towsonu2003> nothlit_, I'm not sure... startx is a habit of mine due to slackware
[08:51] <nothlit_> ^Gecko^, what about nvidia-xconfig
[08:52] <elhaxxorz> khermans_, anything else i can do?
[08:52] <nothlit_> towsonu2003, ahh
[08:52] <^Gecko^> uhm
[08:52] <Milchmann> ok, thank you both. most the time i only need the wysiwyg part for inserting large texts
[08:52] <khermans_> elhaxxorz, no messages before it?
[08:52] <^Gecko^> nothlit_: it said I needed to restart x to use the driver, but x wouldn't reload
[08:52] <nothlit_> towsonu2003, i practice not using that just in case for some reason i'm logged in as root
[08:52] <silentdis> Gecko_: i went through the xserver reconfig, chose 'nvidia' as the driver.  same problem.
[08:52] <^Gecko^> I didn't see nvidia-xconfig until after i reconfigured x
[08:52] <elhaxxorz> no, the app crashes out to the bash shell that i started the program from
[08:52] <babo> my microphone sound doens't seem to be working with my xten softphone ...

[08:56] <ArrenLex> mikeymike-linux: radeon?
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> nope
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> nvidia :)
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> perhaps my nvidia is out of date?
[08:56] <TubaSoldier> I just got done recompiling a new kernel because of timing issues with my laptop. How do i change the kernel path so it points to /usr/src/ instead of my home directory, where i configured and compiled it?
[08:56] <ArrenLex> mikeymike-linux: whichever. I had that problem too. Beryl's still alpha software, I guess it's buggy.
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> ArrenLex, yeah i think thats probably why
[08:56] <ArrenLex> mikeymike-linux: they will be better able to help you with beryl problems on #ubuntu-xgl
[08:56] <noelferreira> peoplo rt61 wireless driver please need help
[08:56] <elhaxxorz> nothlit_, the configuring fro sudo sucks, but i miss the speed that i got. Ubuntu has it hands down in ease of use. I use Gentoo for work, but I am using Ubuntu to try and bring my gf over to Linux. Cedega has been huge in that, nbut it wont run the Sims 2 for her :(
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> ah okay
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> that exists now......
[08:56] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> this xgl beryl/compiz stuff is going crazy......
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> its insane
[08:57] <elhaxxorz> mikeymike-linux, it IS experimental ^^
[08:57] <coz_> mikeymike-linux, yes it is
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> its taking off
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> like a rocket
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> thank god for Novell
[08:57] <mikeymike-linux> :D
[08:58] <^Gecko^> brb, maybe
[08:58] <mikeymike-linux> perhaps this will be the new face of linux?
[08:58] <coz_> mikeymike-linux, cool stuff
[08:58] <silentdis> aargh, still no go.  anyone have any ideas?
[08:58] <Mojo> I have a 24" Dell Monitor, but I can't get the resolution right even if I only put 1920x1200 in xorg.conf.  The "System-> Preferences -> Screen Resolution" only lets me go up to 1280x800.  Anyone know how to get it right?
[08:58] <elhaxxorz> linux has many faces
[08:58] <elhaxxorz> Mojo, what kind of gfx card?
[08:58] <mikeymike-linux> :)
[08:58] <mikeymike-linux> ok let me rephrase
[08:58] <coz_> Mojo, you have to reconfigure xorg
[08:58] <Mojo> Nvidia
[08:58] <mikeymike-linux> perhaps this is the (new) face of consumer linux :)
[08:58] <mikeymike-linux> desktop
[08:58] <Mojo> i did reconfigure xorg.conf
[08:58] <elhaxxorz> !nvidia
[08:58] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:58] <coz_> Mojo, do you know how to do that
[08:58] <coz_> Mojo, ok
[08:59] <noelferreira> rt61 driver working on edgy amd64?
[08:59] <Mojo> "1920x1200" is the only mode
[08:59] <coz_> Mojo, out of curiousity, when you did this did you tick the box for the resolution youwanted with the "space" bar
[08:59] <silentdis> help!  fresh install of dapper, all patches applied.  installed the nvidia-glx driver, enabled it, reconfigured x to use it, and rebooted.  X won't start now, and gives a "no screens found" error in the logs.  what am I doing wrong?
[09:00] <elhaxxorz> silentdis, do you have aim?
[09:00] <Mojo> i didn't really tick any boxes i just edited xorg
[09:00] <coz_> Mojo, no
[09:00] <coz_> Mojo, go to terminal
[09:00] <Mojo> the "Screen Resolution" lets me change the res, but not to 1920x1200
[09:00] <Mojo> ok
[09:00] <elhaxxorz> silentdis, can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
[09:00] <coz_> Mojo, hold on i will type what you should put ther
[09:01] <silentdis> !nvidia
[09:01] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:01] <coz_> Mojo, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:01] <Mojo> shouldn't I be able to get to 1920x1200 without a binary driver?
[09:01] <raghu206> exit
[09:01] <elhaxxorz> coz_, that has gotten me out of so many x problems! :)
[09:02] <coz_> Mojo, type that into the terminal
[09:02] <Mojo> going through the dialogues now
[09:02] <coz_> elhaxxorz, oh yes
[09:03] <coz_> Mojo, when you get to the part for resolutions you HVE TO TICK THE BOC with the SPACE bar
[09:03] <coz_> BOX
[09:03] <Mojo> should I use framebuffer device interface?
[09:03] <nacer> its synergy the software kvm
[09:03] <coz_> Mojo, Mojo no
[09:03] <coz_> simply go through most of the questions with the default until youget to resolutions
[09:04] <noelferreira> edgy amd64 YES OR NOT?
[09:04] <coz_> Mojo,  remeber to tick the box for the resolution youwant with the SPACE bar
[09:04] <silentdis> Mojo: last time I did this and it worked, I chose no, and it worked fine.  what I'm doing wrong this time is beyond me lol
[09:04] <elhaxxorz> noelferreira, what do you use now?
[09:04] <noelferreira> amd64
[09:04] <noelferreira> but i can't configure wireless
[09:04] <coz_> noelferreira, what wireless card do ou have
[09:04] <noelferreira> i mean i use edgy amd64
[09:05] <noelferreira> rt61
[09:05] <elhaxxorz> noelferreira, i did it and i had a lot of stability issues, maybe my hardware or my overclocking though. but i am solid in dapper
=== han3 is now known as hantu
[09:05] <noelferreira> i scan my ap
[09:05] <Mojo> how to restart x server to check?
[09:05] <noelferreira> but i can't get ip
[09:05] <coz_> Mojo, restart
[09:05] <Mojo> etc/init.d/gdm restart?
=== elhaxxorz is now known as El
[09:05] <coz_> Mojo, just restart the system
=== El is now known as El_HaxXoRz
[09:05] <Mojo> ok
[09:05] <noelferreira> there's any advantage in use amd64 bits for now?
[09:06] <Mojo> i'll report back in a bit
[09:06] <Mojo> thanks
[09:06] <mnepton> Mojo: ctl-alt-backspace
[09:06] <coz_> MOok
[09:06] <El_HaxXoRz> noelferreira, yes speed, but not many things are stable on a64 period
[09:06] <rc-1> !beer
[09:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about beer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:06] <El_HaxXoRz> rc-1, well donw

[09:07] <Mojo> It worked
[09:07] <Mojo> thanks coz
[09:07] <El_HaxXoRz> when what noelferreira? stable is dependant on what you think
[09:07] <coz_> Mojo, there you go enjoy
[09:07] <noelferreira> so who can help me with rt61 wireless driver?
[09:08] <coz_> noelferreira, sorry if I didn't see  your answer but did you google to see if the card is supported and if there is a driver for it
[09:08] <gouki> That, it is free, as in free beer! (= (Free as in freedom is Debian 'slogan')
[09:08] <noelferreira> i have it working coz_
[09:08] <noelferreira> yesterday it was ok
[09:08] <coz_> oh ok
[09:08] <noelferreira> but i don't know what i did
[09:08] <coz_> noelferreira, ah oh that is not good but it happens sometimes
[09:08] <noelferreira> when i restartted i coudn't get ip
[09:08] <noelferreira> i scan my ap
[09:08] <coz_> noelferreira, mm
[09:09] <noelferreira> iwconfig shows it
[09:09] <coz_> noelferreira, yes
[09:09] <noelferreira> my essid
[09:09] <coz_> noelferreira, yes
[09:09] <noelferreira> but when i make dhclient doen's get ip
[09:09] <silentdis> ok... i think i see my problem.  I didn'g grab the restricted modules.  I can fix this, just need to know what to pick to get me back into X temporarily.  what is the safe driver called?
[09:09] <coz_> noelferreira, can you static ip the configuration
[09:09] <noelferreira> No DHCPOFFERS received.
[09:09] <noelferreira> No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.
[09:10] <noelferreira> static has the same problem
[09:10] <boink> what does "ifconfig" say?
[09:10] <coz_> noelferreira, mmm  if i were there i could help with this better
[09:10] <boink> you see your card there?
[09:10] <noelferreira> coz_:  i had it working with dhcp and my problem happened when changing to static ip
[09:10] <coz_> noelferreira, oh
[09:10] <boink> check your /etc/network/interfaces
[09:11] <coz_>  well do as boink suggested go to terminal put in ifconfig
[09:11] <pibarnas> is it possible to compile gtk-engines in ubuntu adgy for amd64??
[09:11] <coastermaster> how can I find my IP?
[09:11] <J-_> downloading a torrent, i'm peaking at 300kb/s occasionally... not sure if that
[09:11] <J-_> s
[09:11] <J-_> suppose to happen
[09:11] <J-_> lol
[09:11] <boink> coastermaster: www.whatsmyip.org
[09:11] <gouki> www.whatismyip.com
[09:11] <coz_> coastermaster, ifconfig
[09:11] <noelferreira> boink: what part of ifconfig?
[09:11] <boink> oops .. whatismyop.org
[09:11] <zlack> anybody here who's desktop seems slow with aiglx ?
[09:11] <boink> just do ifconfig
[09:11] <boink> see if eth0 is there
[09:11] <noelferreira> i have too wireless wlan0 and wmaster0 boink
[09:11] <coastermaster> oh, i didn't see it in ifconfig before
[09:12] <coz_> noelferreira, well it should be wlan0
[09:12] <noelferreira> ya
[09:12] <silentdis> aargh, stupid lag, stupid tiny buffer....
[09:12] <silentdis> ok... i think i see my problem.  I didn'g grab the restricted modules.  I can fix this, just need to know what to pick to get me back into X temporarily.  what is the safe driver called?
[09:12] <noelferreira> boink: my driver work fine the problem is dhcp i suspect
[09:12] <babo> #qemu
[09:12] <boink> what's in the /etc/network/interfaces ?
[09:12] <coz_> iwconfig
[09:13] <zlack> silentdis:
[09:13] <noelferreira> can i paste here?
[09:13] <boink> no, you can tell us
[09:13] <zlack> silentdis: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[09:13] <boink> !paste
[09:13] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[09:13] <rc-1> my comp freezes on screensaver, or other graphics intensive stuff, and other problems too (screwey bios/splash screen, floating dotted menu always to bottom right of mouse etc) think i have a fried graphics card?
[09:13] <noelferreira> ok
[09:13] <silentdis> zlack: what does that do?
[09:13] <noelferreira> it is short
[09:13] <coz_> noelferreira, also type in iwconfig
[09:13] <zlack> silentdis: restores your xorg.conf
[09:14] <J-_> holy crap, im peaking at 800kb/s now on bittorrent.. :S
[09:14] <boink> !language
[09:14] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:14] <silentdis> zlack: as much as I'd like to do that, i've probably overwritten it 50 times trying to get it working by this point lol
[09:14] <J-_> sorry
[09:14] <boink> holy moly!
[09:14] <coz_> noelferreira, iwconfig gives readouts for you wireless set up
[09:14] <zlack> silentdis: but you want your original again or what?
[09:14] <SupremacyGnu> hey, I just tried to update from dapper to Edgy. But now I can't even synaptic because it says I type the wrong password, but I'm sure it's right. There's also an error on the update manager saying: Error: BrokenCount > 0
[09:15] <silentdis> zlack: no, i am just looking to choose a 'safe' or 'basic' driver for my xconfig, so I can grab some packages with synaptec that I missed.  I just am not sure what it's called lol
[09:15] <zlack> silentdis: ah sorry - thought you screwed up your xorg
[09:16] <zlack> silentdis: what card?
[09:16] <silentdis> zlack: I did, sort of lol.  forgot to grab the restricted modules.  needed for the nvidia driver
[09:16] <noelferreira> my /etc/network/interfaces   iface eth0 inet dhcp
[09:16] <noelferreira> iface wlan0 inet dhcp
[09:16] <noelferreira> wireless-essid Amilcar's Bar
[09:16] <noelferreira> iwconfig shows my essid
[09:16] <silentdis> zlack: nvidia Geforce 7600gs
[09:16] <patient> I'll try
[09:16] <boink> that's in order, as it should be
[09:16] <coz_> noelferreira, the essid should be a group of numbers the name you hve should be the nickname only
[09:17] <zlack> silentdis: shouldn't it be just nvidia then as a driver?
[09:17] <boink> maybe look at the router ... any security setting there stopping you from using it?
[09:17] <coz_> noelferreira, but maybe that will work
[09:17] <zlack> where is the file located for my eth0 configuration?
[09:17] <boink> /etc/network/interfaces
[09:17] <noelferreira> but i use it fine i dapper boink
[09:17] <zlack> thanks boink
[09:18] <silentdis> zlack: yes, if i had the restricted modules installed, this would be working just fine.  problem is, i forgot them, and need to grab them with synaptic.  i just need to get back into X long enough to do that.  just not sure what to pick for the driver in my config right now, as a 'safe' driver
[09:18] <SupremacyGnu> how do I fix this? dpkg: unable to access dpkg status area: Read-only file system
[09:18] <noelferreira> i have the name of my essid coz_
[09:18] <coz_> noelferreira, ok guy
[09:18] <zlack> silentdis: try Xorg -configure and see if that works
[09:18] <noelferreira> i guess i can't associate now
[09:19] <zlack> boink: i don't have the /etc/network/interfaces. should that dir exist by default?
[09:19] <silentdis> zlack: thank you.  i am just not explaining my situation well it appears.  my apologies for the confusion.  I'll just tinker :)
[09:19] <noelferreira> wlan0: no IPv6 routers present
[09:19] <noelferreira> coz dmesg shows this error wlan0: no IPv6 routers present
[09:19] <dws_> Does anybody know where it is configured, that gnome-netstatus-applet is started by default? I would like to remove it from the default session for new users, because I have installed networkmonitor and it is confusing to have to similar-looking applets
[09:19] <zlack> silentdis: maybe i'm just up too shortly
[09:20] <coz_> noelferreira, mm waht about IPV4
[09:20] <boink> it's a file, not a dir
[09:20] <SupremacyGnu> When updating from dapper to edgy, it ain't supposed to change my password right?
[09:20] <noelferreira> how can i see that?
[09:20] <timfrost> silentdis: the drivers for NVidia are nv and nvidia.
[09:20] <noelferreira> or change it coz_
[09:20] <zlack> ah interfaces is a file. wonder why eth0 isn't in it
[09:21] <Lynoure> SupremacyGnu: no, it is not supposed to
[09:21] <coz_> noelferreira, I am not sure ta this point I am the kind that needs to see what is happening, I don't want to waiste yourtime here perhaps someone else can be a beter faster help for you
[09:21] <silentdis> zlack, timfrost: I fount it.  just tried a couple till one worked.  i'm on the vesa driver right now.  just needed to get in so I could use synaptic :)
[09:21] <zlack> anybody here running edgy + aiglx and can offer me some help ?
[09:21] <zlack> silentdis: cool
[09:21] <coz_> zlack, i am running both
[09:21] <noelferreira> can you say who coz_?
[09:22] <Madpilot> zlack, #ubuntu-xgl
[09:22] <SupremacyGnu> Lynoure, then, why has it changed my password? I can't do anything
[09:22] <firebird619> When Ubuntu starts, just before it shows the login screen sometimes, and mostly all the time just before it shows the part where everything is loading, the screen is black and multiple colored dots or something. Is that hardware related or a setting in Ubuntu?
[09:22] <coz_> noelferreira, not really but boink seems to know about this
[09:22] <zlack> coz_: did you had some slowness problems with aiglx ?
[09:22] <coz_> zlack, not really, what is going on?
[09:22] <noelferreira> can you help me boink? i get this error wlan0: no IPv6 routers present
[09:23] <noelferreira> i can't associate
[09:23] <zlack> coz_: when i try to rotate my cube - somethimes its ok, but other times its just slow. i don't have a high cpu load, and disabled most stuff in beryl-manager
[09:23] <silentdis> ok.  now to just reconfigure x again, and a quicky reboot.  thanks all for pointing me in the right direction.  see ya!
[09:23] <zlack> coz_: and i don't have any errors in Xorg.0.log
[09:23] <coz_> zlack, mm what is your processor  amount of memory
[09:23] <zlack> coz: pentium M 2.1 Ghz, 1GB of ram
[09:24] <zlack> coz_: ati r300 card
[09:24] <SupremacyGnu> omg I can't loose my files. Could someone help me out here? When updating from dapper to edgy it changed my password and I got error:  BrokenCount < 0
[09:24] <coz_> zlack, well you know I na 1.7 ghz and igig ram and it works ok so therfore something either with the install or settings
[09:24] <magical_trevsky> SupremacyGnu, can you login with the recovery kernel?
[09:24] <coz_> zlack, lets see here let melook at mine hold on
[09:24] <magical_trevsky> SupremacyGnu, that should drop you at a root shell without asking for a pass
[09:25] <coz_> zlack,  what how to did you follow?
[09:25] <SupremacyGnu> magical_trevsky, ok. No I haven't tried that yet
[09:25] <zlack> coz_: the howto on beryl-project.org
[09:25] <SoftIce> hi, is there a way to downgrade from edgy to dapper again?
[09:25] <SupremacyGnu> magical_trevsky, anopther question. I can't update correctly because it says the files are read only.
[09:25] <SoftIce> could I just replace the repo's list?
[09:26] <zlack> coz_: basically just apt-get beryl and start the beryl-manager
[09:26] <coz_> zlack, ok that is a good one did you check to make sure all the insertions into xorg were there and correct?
[09:26] <boink> !downgrade
[09:26] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[09:26] <boink> thus, downgrading is totally pointless
[09:26] <zlack> coz_: any special things i should do? the howto told me nothing to change in xorg.conf
[09:26] <magical_trevsky> SupremacyGnu, is your ubuntu partition mounted as read only?
[09:26] <SoftIce> ok, but if your system is broken is it possible?
[09:26] <boink> no
[09:26] <coz_> zlack, is this the one you used    http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[09:27] <SoftIce> boink: possible, but you don't recommend?
[09:27] <SupremacyGnu> SupremacyGnu, I don't know. kinda a new linux user
[09:27] <zlack> coz_: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
[09:27] <boink> depends on how much time you want to waste doing something useless
[09:27] <_array> What is Edgy?
[09:27] <boink> !edgy
[09:27] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[09:27] <coz_> zlack, use the one I gave you to check your xorg file
[09:27] <SoftIce> all, these new packages have way to many restrctions, plus depreceated vars in php, etc etc
[09:27] <zlack> coz_: thanks
[09:27] <_array> I see
[09:27] <coz_> zlack, let me know
[09:27] <zlack> coz_: will do
[09:28] <boink> then for the sake of sanity, do a re-install.
[09:28] <_array> I'm still on breezy 5.10
[09:28] <_array> I need to upgrade!
[09:28] <boink> just reinstall dapper .. you get three years support on dapper
[09:28] <boink> five years on theserver
[09:28] <Werdna> If ndiswrapper wants the stuff in /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/build, what package should I install to get it?
[09:28] <boink> !upgrade
[09:28] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[09:28] <_array> !sex
[09:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sex - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:29] <_array> damn ;(
[09:29] <_array> Is it AI Capable?
[09:29] <timfrost> Werdna: sudo apt-get linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[09:29] <boink> c'mon, _array .. let's behave here
[09:29] <boink> the ops aren't nice
[09:29] <xukun> Hi all after upgrading to edgy my vmware workstation will not start. I installed the linux-headers-'uname -r' but now when I run "sudo vmware-config.pl" I get this error "Unable to build the vmmon module"
[09:29] <_array> boink: I'm just messing around :)
[09:29] <Lynoure> _array: it's an editor, originally made by a Debian developer Lars Wirzenius
[09:29] <Werdna> timfrost: already got that installed; although I did it from the .deb
[09:29] <xukun> Please help If you can
[09:29] <Werdna> !irritate Werdna
[09:31] <Lynoure> xukun: have you tried reinstalling wmware? you have a different kernel now
[09:31] <XiXaQ> I have a dyndns domain. Should I setup host or domain in System>Administration>network  to reflect that domain?
[09:32] <firebird619> I have both GNOME and KDE installed. Is there a way to, when in GNOME, show only the GNOME applications, and KDE show only KDE applications?
[09:32] <xukun> Lynoure, I had never reinstalled vmware before. I always did the vmware-config.pl after installing the new linux-headers
[09:32] <timfrost> Werdna: are you running off a live CD, or an install?  I upgraded an X86 system to edgy, and have  2.6.17-10-generic, rather than 2.6.17-10-386
[09:32] <XiXaQ> firebird619, manipulate the menus, you mean?
[09:33] <Werdna> timfrost: install
[09:33] <fnf> Hi, is anyone using Vim in Edgy here ?. I have an issue with syntax coloring which can't be enabled.
[09:33] <firebird619> XiXaQ: I guess that would maybe be it, not sure. I just want so that when I am in GNOME, it doesn't show the KDE apps in the menus.
[09:33] <Lynoure> xukun: it sounds a bit like the version you have does not want to work with this kernel version, so it is worth a shot, at least
[09:33] <Sasuke> ok, if i type apt-get install apache2.,... how do i tell if i have CGI on
[09:34] <XiXaQ> firebird619, in System>Preferences, there is a tool for configuring your gnome menus.
[09:35] <firebird619> XiXaQ: Great, Thank You. Do you know what would cause the problem I had mentioned earlier about the black screen with multiple colored dots or whatever they are?
[09:35] <noelferreira> rt61 wireless and edgy, anyone?
[09:35] <coz_> noelferreira, no one taking you up on that yet???

[09:36] <troopa> I can't seem to install Ubuntu. I fixed X failing to load by issuing: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and using the VESA driver and setting my proper resolution. I even disabled DRI, because this can cause some issues with my card, but when I issue startx, it will start and I hear music, but my monitor light turns to amber and I see nothing.
[09:36] <firebird619> XiXaQ: about 10 minutes ago.
[09:37] <troopa> Almost like it turns itself off (like in a power saving mode)
[09:37] <coz_> noelferreira, mm on the system or in the mamager?
[09:37] <noelferreira> system i guess
[09:37] <troopa> I tried the common (disable DRI, use LVDS,Auto) fixes that I found online.

[09:52] <CarinArr> voodoo, are you trying to play mp3s by any chance
[09:53] <khermans_> blazemonger, i wouldnt personally do that command, but you asked for a "complete development system"
[09:53] <CarinArr> voodoo, cause there isn't an mp3 codec pre-installed, you need to install one
[09:53] <Bahamuth> more over cuz i love the edgy version but no internet means no money
[09:53] <voodoo> no a avi movie,,,,,,some part does'nt listen
[09:53] <khermans_> voodoo, sudo aptitude install vlc
[09:53] <voodoo> but i upgrade the system and before everything works fine
[09:53] <c_lisp> voodoo right click on mplayer go to prefrence go to the codec tab
[09:54] <c_lisp> change audio codec to
[09:54] <c_lisp> FFmpeg/libavcodec audio decoders
[09:54] <c_lisp> that will solve the problem
[09:54] <voodoo> yea i did it
[09:54] <voodoo> but no,,,,,,,,some part of the movie audio are missing
[09:54] <khermans_> voodoo, install vlc already

[10:19] <blind> Okay, I have an issue. I started messing around with beryl and I somehow lost my 1280*1024 resolution. In an effort to get it back, I played with my xorg.conf, and actually took out all other resolutions from it. However, all the options are still in the Screen Resolution dialog and I still cannot get 1280*1024. Yes, I restarted X, I even rebooted my computer. It's as if my xorg.conf is not being read. Are there other files that influenc
[10:19] <noelferreira> are you there khermans_?

[10:21] <noelferreira> need help people
[10:21] <kikokos> hi
[10:21] <babo> does anyone get that error in skype where someone can hear your voice for 2 seconds but then it just cuts out ?
[10:21] <noelferreira> rt61 wireless driver? anyone with it working on edgy?
[10:22] <kikokos> I have special problem with my Edgy yesterday I`ve lost icons...I see just wall-paper what`s up?
[10:22] <Illiyah> Ive had a few probs with edgy and xinetd, shame really
[10:22] <kikokos> Has anybody the same situation?
[10:22] <kikokos> Illiayah I too :)
[10:22] <Juhaz> kikokos, sounds like nautilus isn't running
[10:22] <Illiyah> kikokos probs with xinetd?
[10:22] <kikokos> probably yes
[10:23] <kikokos> but how start it ?
[10:23] <Illiyah> start what?
[10:23] <kikokos> alt+f2 does nothing
[10:23] <kikokos> Juhaz?
[10:23] <tlp_> hello
[10:23] <Illiyah> I dont know, Im going to switch to debian later, I need this app working and I cant fix it in edgy
[10:23] <Juhaz> well, if alt+f2 doesn't work either, then there's something more than that amiss..
[10:23] <tlp_> what is the best way to configure X in ubuntu?
[10:24] <J-_> http://s80.photobucket.com/albums/j167/justin_c18/?action=view&current=Screenshot-2.png&refPage=&imgAnch=imgAnch1    check out the speed. :S i'm used to 100 kb/s or less with no change in service.
=== glitch- is now known as glitchz
[10:24] <kikokos> :) and what you think maybe reinstall or what,,,,
[10:24] <ndlovu_> I asked this earlier but then my connection went weird, so I apologise if there were replies. Q: is there some way to move an ext3 partition? my /usr partition needs more space.
[10:24] <tlp_> what packages should i install?
[10:24] <Illiyah> format and install
[10:24] <alcor> Lathiat i try BJC-210 & BJC210sp .but can't printing test page
=== glitchz is now known as glitch-
[10:25] <Illiyah> ndlovu try the gparted livecd?
[10:25] <tlp_> is there an XF86Setup?
[10:25] <Illiyah> tlp_ its configured when you install
[10:25] <ndlovu_> Illiyah, gparted can resize an ext3 partition, but can't move it
[10:25] <tlp_> Illiyah : when i installed it did not configure X
[10:26] <Illiyah> whatd you mean by move it, why dont you jsut do - mv -rg here/ there/
[10:26] <kikokos> aaaa and second: When ubu starting I see "assemvbling RAID devices" FAIL , for what response RAID?
[10:26] <ndlovu_> Illiyah, so I can't create more space after the /usr partition
[10:26] <tlp_> Illiyah: i installed the server version, could that make a difference?
[10:26] <Illiyah> tlp_ ahh, did you use the alternate cd or server cd?
[10:26] <tlp_> i guess i will try the desktop version
[10:26] <Juhaz> kikokos, unlikely to be anything that needs a reinstall, but hard to say without any details
[10:26] <tlp_> ok i think i know the problem
[10:26] <tlp_> Illiyah : thanks
[10:26] <Illiyah> tlp_ wait
[10:26] <tlp_> ok
[10:27] <Illiyah> try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[10:27] <blazemonger> i just installed kubuntu-desktop ..if i install xubuntu-desktop will it intefere with the stuff i need to install for development for all the meta-packages
[10:27] <Illiyah> see if that works
[10:27] <tlp_> ok i will try that
[10:27] <Illiyah> lemme know how it goes
[10:27] <tlp_> are there tuning differences between desktop and server?
[10:27] <Illiyah> not sure
[10:27] <tlp_> i wanted to install server with X because i was going to use it as a development machine
[10:27] <tlp_> the production machine wouldn't have X
[10:28] <Illiyah> I like server, less services
[10:28] <nomad111> hey all i get this message when i try to install a ppd file /etc/init.d/cups: Command not found.
[10:28] <nomad111> wat do i do
[10:28] <tlp_> i really like how ubuntu works
[10:28] <concept10> !ntfs
[10:28] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[10:28] <tlp_> well compared to centos which i was using before
[10:28] <Illiyah> try, sudo apt-get install cups nomad111
[10:28] <aum> hi - when i run xsane, it flashes up 'checking for devices' then quits immediately - how do i fix?
[10:28] <Illiyah> centos is nice on servers (I find)
[10:29] <nomad111> Illiyah, but i already have cups
[10:29] <Illiyah> aum try running xsane in a terminal and see if theres an error message
[10:29] <abbyz> hello!!
[10:29] <aum> Illiyah, i've done that - there's no output to the terminal
[10:29] <Illiyah> not sure nomad111 Ive never used cups Im afraid, or tho I noticed it runs on an http server which I found weird
[10:29] <nomad111> i think cups is located in /etc/cups not /etc/init.d/cups
[10:29] <Illiyah> aum weird, not sure Im afriad
[10:29] <nomad111> do u suppose i should create a symbolic link
[10:29] <aum> Illiyah, same for scanimage and xscanimage
[10:30] <Illiyah> did you try the forums for the error msg?
[10:30] <bishillo> nomad111: /etc/init.d/cupsys
[10:30] <aum> no error message
[10:30] <bishillo> That is the script to restart cups
[10:30] <Illiyah> weird
[10:30] <mnepton> nomad111: how are you trying to install the .ppd? from the GNOME "add a printer" dialogs?
[10:30] <nomad111> no no
[10:30] <nomad111> its a deb package
[10:31] <mnepton> uhhh .... that sounds ugly
[10:31] <nomad111> thats why i think i need to create a symbolic link
[10:31] <hume> anyone knows how to disable tapping on an alps touchpad in edgy?
[10:31] <mnepton> nomad111: what flavor of printer?
[10:31] <nomad111> im a noob at this so i dont necessarily kno wat im talking about lol
[10:31] <nomad111> brother mfc-620cn
[10:31] <Illiyah> hume tapping as in clicking?
[10:31] <nomad111> the company has linux drivers!
[10:31] <hume> Illiyah, yes
[10:31] <sparr> so...  dash vs bash vs sh.  go.
[10:31] <mnepton> nomad111: does Brother have a PPD on their site? i got the one for my 5250DN right from Brother
[10:32] <Illiyah> hume on my laptop thats done in the bios, using a dell latitude D600
[10:32] <bishillo> nomad111: ubly linux drivers :)
[10:32] <bishillo> ugly
[10:32] <nomad111> mnepton, i got a cupswrapper driver
[10:32] <troopa> Well,  I think my problem with X is something with my MonitorLayout, but I have tried several combos with no working config.
[10:32] <hume> Illiyah, ok, not on mine, i disabled via xorg.conf in dapper but that does not seem to work in edgy
[10:32] <nomad111> mnepton, wat that does is it installs the ppd
[10:32] <mnepton> nomad111: you should only need the ppd itself
[10:32] <noelferreira> people how could i change font size in xgl-beryl ? mine are too small
[10:32] <J-_> the hp 6210 officejet works awesome in ubuntu
[10:32] <nomad111> mnepton, i think the cups folder changed in edgy
[10:32] <nomad111> to /etc/cups/
[10:32] <nomad111> prolly coz of that new init system?
[10:33] <Illiyah> I dont like the new init system, its weird
[10:33] <mnepton> nomad111: the standard GNOME add printer dialog will allow you to add a driver, at which point you just select the correct .ppd file
[10:33] <tlp__> Illiyah : in edgy
[10:33] <tlp__> ?
[10:33] <Illiyah> tlp_ yeah
[10:33] <nomad111> mnepton, my brother doesnt directly have a ppd
[10:34] <mnepton> nomad111: sec
[10:34] <tlp__> i heard there are some problems with edgy
[10:34] <tlp__> im going to wait until they get ironed out
[10:34] <Illiyah> Im having problems with xinetd with it, cant get it going at all
[10:34] <nomad111> mnepton, http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/cups_wrapper_install.html
[10:34] <tlp__> Illiyah : the service wont run at all?
[10:35] <mjbjr> I see there is a MD5SUMS.gpg (signature ?) file for 6.10... anyone know where the key that was used to sign the MD5SUMS file is?  or its id?
[10:35] <Terminus> tlp__: if you're waiting for things to get ironed out, you're waiting for the next LTS. =)
[10:35] <blazemonger> there are a few tlp but they'll get fixed
[10:35] <Illiyah> tlp_ its running, but the way glftpd is setup is it runs via xinetd, e.g someone connects on port1 and xinetd opens glftpd on that port, but its not opening it
[10:36] <tlp__> Illiyah : you running tshark on it?
[10:36] <Illiyah> nope, never heard of that
[10:36] <tlp__> tcpdump
[10:36] <tlp__> tethereal
[10:36] <Illiyah> oh nope, neither
[10:36] <Illiyah> nmap shows the ports listing
[10:36] <troopa> Do all of these annoying X errors reside in the LTS version or just Edgy?
[10:36] <noelferreira> people xgl-beryl font size too small! any help?
[10:36] <tlp__> is it on eth0?
[10:37] <Illiyah> tlp_ I believe so
[10:37] <tlp__> Illiyah : doesnt ftp require more than one port?
[10:37] <tlp__> Illiyah : try ...     tshark -i eth0 port 21 or port 22
[10:38] <tlp__> arg that is wrong
[10:38] <tlp__> tshark -i eth0 port 21 or port 20
[10:38] <tlp__> then ftp to that service, see if there is a problem with the network
[10:38] <Illiyah> ohh tshark is the new ethereal right?
[10:38] <tlp__> yeah
[10:38] <tlp__> wireshark
[10:38] <tlp__> thats the console version of it
[10:39] <noelferreira> xgl-beryl font too small help please
=== glitch- is now known as glitchz
[10:39] <noelferreira> anyone?
[10:39] <tlp__> if you dont see problems there you can install the src deb of xinetd
[10:39] <Illiyah> sweet, Ill give it ago, thanks tlp_
=== glitchz is now known as bazoo
[10:39] <blazemonger> would it screw up my system if i have ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop installed at once?
[10:39] <tlp__> compile it with debug, then attach the process with gdb
[10:39] <tlp__> and see where its messing up
[10:39] <blazemonger> if i'm using ubuntu for development and testing sources
[10:40] <tlp__> blazemonger : maybe should look into vmware
=== bazoo is now known as bazookahs
=== bazookahs is now known as glitchz
[10:40] <troopa> Can anyone verify if all of these annoying X errors are in both Daper and Edgy or just Edgy?
[10:40] <blazemonger> TLE:is there a way to do like a jail or something
[10:41] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, you are welcome to do that. alot of people have combinations of the 3. i've never heard of someone having all 3 tho :P
[10:41] <blazemonger> TLE:so you wouldn't reccomend having all three installed at once
[10:41] <SoftIce> hi, how can I use apt to search what packages I have installed
[10:41] <SoftIce> apt-cache?
[10:41] <kozatt> hi SoftIce , dpkg -la
[10:41] <SoftIce> thanks
[10:41] <tlp__> blazemonger : i recommend using vmware or uml for doing something like that
[10:42] <tlp__> if you need to test stuff, do development in multiple configurations
[10:42] <Ropechoborra> !rar
[10:42] <ubotu> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[10:42] <Illiyah> its still good tho non free
[10:42] <tlp__> i like tar and bz2
[10:42] <Bokeh> mornin' peeps
[10:42] <kozatt> How can I configure my kernel to recognize root partition by UUID at boot time ?
[10:42] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, if you're doing development, when you build the code. you should probably do it in a pbuilder environment tho.
[10:43] <ndowens> is there a place to see all the packages that come with ubbuntu 6.10
[10:43] <nomad111> omg last thing i need was printer trouble so much stuff has changed in 6.10
[10:43] <khaije1> !backup
[10:43] <ubotu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi
[10:43] <blazemonger> a pbuilder environment?
[10:43] <blazemonger> so having ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-destkop and xubuntu-desktop will bring along too many conflicts/
[10:44] <fm> hi
[10:45] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, yeah, basically pbuilder is a chroot, with ubuntu-minimal installed & build-essential, anything else the package requires to build, you will have to tell it to add to the environment. makes high quality debs :)
[10:45] <fm> I have installed the nvidia beta drivers. When I boot up normally I get a black screen BUT the mouse is showing.When I boot up in recovery mode and then type "telinit 3" gdm starts and everything is fine... any explanation?
[10:45] <ndlovu_> ndowens, check packages.ubuntu.com
[10:45] <ndowens> ty ndlovu_
[10:46] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, you "should" be fine to install ubuntu-desktop & kubuntu-desktop & xubuntu-desktop on the single system. i know of people who have have xubuntu & kubuntu or ubuntu & kubuntu. but never anyone with all 3
[10:46] <ndowens> ndlovu_: will it tell the packages that come on 6.10 iso/cd
[10:46] <blazemonger> oh interesting
[10:46] <Bokeh> never had a problem with it :)
[10:47] <Bokeh> just switching back your usplash screen can be a bit hard if you don't know update-alternatives
[10:48] <noelferreira> people
[10:48] <noelferreira> beryl xgl font size too samall
[10:48] <noelferreira> anyone?
[10:48] <blazemonger> would you reccomend compiling X4ce from scratch to avoid dependencies
[10:48] <ndlovu_> ndowens, I'm not sure, but I think the package labels will tell you - if it doesn't say universe or multiverse, it's probably on the CD
[10:48] <nomad111> mkdir: cannot create directory `/var/spool/lpd/MFC620CN': No such file or directory. I dont have the lpd directory in there wat do i need to do to get it
[10:48] <noelferreira> khermans_: are tou there?
[10:48] <ndowens> ndlovu_: ty
[10:49] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, nope, i'd recommend using the packages. you get support that way :)
[10:49] <SoftIce> whats package needs to be installed on ubuntu for php to be supported under apache 2?
[10:49] <Bokeh> mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd; chown -R lp:lp /var/spool/lpd
[10:50] <Bokeh> SoftIce: libapache2-mod-php4
[10:50] <Bokeh> or libapache2-mod-php5
[10:50] <Bokeh> depending on what version
[10:50] <Bokeh> and i'd recommend you read in on apt-cache :)
[10:50] <DarkMageZ> SoftIce, grab the php5 package.
[10:50] <SoftIce> its allready at the latest version
[10:51] <SoftIce> yet it wants to download my php files
[10:51] <SoftIce> not run them
[10:51] <ndowens> anyone use the filesystem: xfs?
[10:51] <siccness> not I
[10:51] <blazemonger> i can't install x-window-system-dev ..could it be because i dont have the backports?
[10:51] <DarkMageZ> SoftIce, hmm, k, i'll see what i did on my server
[10:51] <SoftIce> thanks
[10:51] <eilker> hi, i wanna install lamp , is there any easy tool ? or should i need install those one by  one ?
[10:51] <Bokeh> then you've probably not linked your configs correctly
[10:51] <mjbjr> soooo....  how are you supposed to verify the MD5SUMS file without a gpg key?  where is the ubuntu key that was used to do that?
[10:51] <Bokeh> go see if php is linked in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
[10:51] <Bokeh> there should be a symlink to php4.load and php4.conf
[10:51] <Bokeh> or 5, whichever your version :)
[10:52] <SoftIce> no, php5 isn't there
[10:53] <tlp__> what language is apt written in?
[10:53] <Bokeh> ok, symlink /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.* to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
[10:53] <blazemonger> i've been interested in php..would it be good to start with php5 or php4?
[10:53] <blazemonger> or is it possible to have both installed
[10:53] <ndowens> ndlovu_: reson i need to know is b/c i have to use ppp b/c i have internet through my pc from phone, so i figure i should be able to cp the configs and put them in ubuntu if the ppp is installed by default, do u know if pppconfigs go in /etc/ppp like other distros
[10:53] <tlp__> php5
[10:54] <numist> blazemonger: its possible to have both installed, but you may as well just go with php5
[10:54] <Bokeh> yeah, php5 is the way to go
[10:54] <Bokeh> if you want to start coding php, start the right way
[10:54] <Bokeh> instead of the messy way
[10:54] <mnepton> SoftIce: are .php files correctly MIME typed and set as valid doctypes in Apache's conf?
[10:54] <noelferreira> beryl small font size?
[10:54] <noelferreira> anoe
[10:54] <osfameron> or start straight away with ruby, perl, or python instead :-)
[10:54] <tlp__> i thought php was messy all the way around
[10:54] <Bokeh> true, but there's php5-messy and php4-messy
[10:55] <ndlovu_> ndowens, I can't say, but my understanding is that ppp is not installed by default (a lot of people have complained about this in previous releases)
[10:55] <Bokeh> and yeah, try python if you're interested in a real men's language
[10:55] <music_man_nz> php isnb't messy!
[10:55] <tlp__> oh, perl isn't messy?
[10:55] <numist> php5 is generally better, and php5 will generally run all php4 code, although it will throw pedantic notices for class vars
[10:55] <osfameron> perl can be messy
[10:55] <Bokeh> perl is supposed to be messy
[10:55] <SoftIce> thanks
[10:55] <blazemonger> so with pbuilder i can do like a jail process?
[10:55] <blazemonger> like have ubuntu running within ubuntu?
[10:55] <osfameron> but perl has namespaces and a slightly more streamlined function set
[10:55] <XiXaQ> in Windows, I could edit the hosts. file to create a fake domain name for an ip. How can I do that in Ubuntu? I want to create a few local domains for 127.0.0.1, like www.mylocalubuntumachine.home and www.mylocalmailserver.home
[10:55] <ndowens> ndlovu_: well according to that page, kppp isn't in universe or the other one, so if it comes with kppp then it has to have ppp installed
[10:55] <osfameron> that's why I suggested ruby first (even though I program perl myself)
[10:56] <music_man_nz> How can I get rid of the handles on my panel? When it isn't expanded, there are some ugly handles left and right
[10:56] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, that's sorta the idea
[10:56] <Bokeh> and the advantage of perl: you can sacrifice your first-born and it will write the code by itself
[10:56] <Bokeh> problem is that you'll never be able to read it afterwards
[10:56] <osfameron> heh
[10:56] <blazemonger> DarkMageZ neatt!
[10:56] <blazemonger> is there a how-to?
[10:56] <osfameron> I've seen unreadable perl, and I've seen unreadable perl
[10:56] <eilker> hi, i wanna install lamp , is there any easy tool ? or should i need install those one by  one ?
[10:56] <osfameron> er
[10:56] <osfameron> :-)=
[10:56] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/pbuilder-doc/pbuilder-doc.html#id225091
[10:56] <osfameron> and readable perl
[10:57] <music_man_nz> eilker: Look up Xampp on Google it is easy to install and use
[10:57] <music_man_nz> So how can I get rid of those white handles either side of my non-expanded dock?
[10:57] <Bokeh> hmmm..... there used to be a lamp install option on dapper alternate
[10:57] <eilker> music_man_nz:thanx
[10:57] <Bokeh> but i believe they've taken that out
[10:57] <tlp__> i dont see any advantage of perl after ruby was written
[10:57] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/index.html
[10:57] <snadge> hmm.. im running on a system that was originally hoary, updated to breezy, then dapper.. and now edgy.  i wonder if its going to explode :)
[10:57] <webben> tlp__: speed?
[10:57] <music_man_nz> Eilker: Make sure you read the instructions about installing though. Use the command line
[10:58] <osfameron> yeah, speed for now, and CPAN
[10:58] <webben> tlp__: decent unicode support?
[10:58] <osfameron> ruby's catching up though
[10:58] <osfameron> I really must learn ruby...
[10:58] <tlp__> webben : ruby doesnt have decent unicode support?
[10:58] <ndlovu_> ndowens, could be - I've just heard of people installing and not being able to dial
[10:58] <webben> tlp__: notoriously, no
[10:58] <Bokeh> advantage of perl is that it's quicker and dirtier than a high school prom queen
[10:58] <tlp__> if you need speed write extensions in C
[10:58] <music_man_nz> Can I remove these handles!?
[10:58] <webben> tlp__: it's all because Ruby's from Japan. And Japan is annoyed at Han Unification.
[10:58] <tlp__> webben : hmm i would guess it would have it because it was made in japan
[10:58] <tlp__> oh
[10:58] <ndowens> ndlovu_: well atm i am on gentoo and it is working from the config i have setup
[10:58] <blazemonger> DarkMageZ Thanks alot man..I'm loving Ubuntu even more
[10:59] <pty> osfameron: http://tryruby.hobix.com/
[10:59] <webben> tlp__: Hopefully, it will be fixed in Ruby 1.9. Whether it will be fixed /well/ is unclear.
[10:59] <savvas> need for speed!! /me runs
[10:59] <Bokeh> music_man_nz: right click, properties, uncheck show hide buttons
[10:59] <blazemonger> darkmage do you see micro-nets becoming a popular thing when the internet becomes "too governed"?
[10:59] <music_man_nz> doesn't work
[10:59] <osfameron> pty: nice :-)
[10:59] <osfameron> actually I have ruby installed on laptop I think
[10:59] <music_man_nz> They are not buttons. They are just ugly handles
[10:59] <osfameron> it's more a time thing
[10:59] <Bokeh> ah
[10:59] <tlp__> webben : i heard windows support is kind of lacking with ruby
[10:59] <Bokeh> those handles
[10:59] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, have fun, and don't forget to file bugs :P
[10:59] <Bokeh> no, you can't remove them i think
[10:59] <music_man_nz> what!?
[10:59] <webben> tlp__: Other than that, ruby is pretty darn cool. But given most of what I code involves text processing and requires speed (e.g. speedy XML transformation), Ruby's not for me.
[10:59] <Bokeh> you mean the dotted handles you use to drag the bar?
[11:00] <music_man_nz> So my transparent panel has to have these unsightly handles
[11:00] <music_man_nz> Yes
[11:00] <tlp__> webben : mostly what i do is with python and C
[11:00] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, look, america will lose its power over the internet if that happens :)
[11:00] <blazemonger> the hardest part about ubuntu is deb packages
[11:00] <Bokeh> fraid so, musicman
[11:00] <Bokeh> blame the gnome developers for shitty transparency support
[11:00] <music_man_nz> That is ridiculous. Why have the transparent option!?
[11:00] <tlp__> webben : so you do a lot of perl?
[11:00] <Bokeh> then again, transparency is a tool of the desktop devil :P
[11:00] <blazemonger> DarkMageZ: i think we should all start micro-nets
[11:00] <webben> tlp__: Don't know any C/C++. Wish I did. Currently fooling around with Django, which so far I prefer to Rails in some ways. (Although most of Rails's problems are actually /Ruby/ problems.)
[11:01] <music_man_nz> Transparency / translucency is awesome.
[11:01] <tlp__> webben : thats what i do, is django
[11:01] <pty> i find ruby excellent for prototyping and stuff
[11:01] <Bokeh> the transparency option is only there to stop the whining "i want my desktop to be lickable" people :)
[11:01] <blazemonger> because the internet has been corrupted ..i saw it coming 15 years ago
[11:01] <Bokeh> if you want a shiny transparent desktop, i'd suggest going for kde
[11:01] <webben> tlp__: No, I don't do much Perl either tbh.
[11:01] <music_man_nz> Well they have done a half-job on that
[11:01] <tlp__> webben : i used rails, then i wanted to write my own framework, then i found django
[11:01] <pty> on our big apps we stick to java :'(
[11:01] <blazemonger> a unix instructor told us that he saw that commercialization of the internet would ruin it
[11:01] <Bokeh> they have
[11:01] <osfameron> pty: oo, I like the tutorial thing, that's very nicely thought out
[11:01] <music_man_nz> Hmph
[11:01] <tlp__> webben : pretty much all the frameworks in python before django are not good
[11:02] <DarkMageZ> blazemonger, unfortunatly this topic isn't suited for this channel. #ubuntu-offtopic or ##politics is better for that
[11:02] <Bokeh> but tbh the best thing about gnome is that it's clean.... no transparent window, handle, or widget is going to make it cleaner :)
[11:02] <music_man_nz> Can't I open some config file and remove it?
[11:02] <blazemonger> i hope ubuntu buys it out lol
[11:02] <Bokeh> nope
[11:02] <Bokeh> no cigar
[11:02] <tlp__> the internet is commercialized
[11:02] <music_man_nz> clean? You mean, non-functional? Can't even edit menu items with right click
[11:02] <pty> osfameron: yeah, i already knew ruby quite well when i found it but still found it fun to work through
[11:02] <blazemonger> tlp:that's what ruined it
[11:02] <Bokeh> sigh
[11:02] <mnepton> blazemonger: you can't buy something that isn;t for sale.
[11:03] <blazemonger> everything is like all graphical ..i miss the days where everything was ansi/text based
[11:03] <tlp__> i think ruby on rails is cool
[11:03] <Flosoft> hey
[11:03] <music_man_nz> Ye well, if youare going graphical (like entire consumer market wants) then you had better make a good job of it!
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[11:03] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 driver working?
[11:03] <Flosoft> can someone help me setting up Lighttpd on Dapper?
[11:03] <blazemonger> maybe we'll all start micro-nets when humans kill the internet
[11:03] <Flosoft> I can't get PHP to work?
[11:03] <Bokeh> musicman: applications->accessories->alacarte menu editor
=== kenny is now known as k3nny
[11:03] <mnepton> Flosoft: you need php-cgi
[11:04] <music_man_nz> Bah. Right Click! And you can't delete from Alacarte
=== k3nny is now known as kennyyy
[11:04] <Bokeh> just because it works in a different way doesn't mean it's working in the wrong way
[11:04] <Flosoft> mnepton: I know
[11:04] <Juhaz> tlp__, there aren't that many python frameworks before django, it's pretty old
[11:04] <music_man_nz> lol, that does not get it off the hook
[11:04] <Flosoft> mnepton: I installed PHP5-CGI
[11:04] <Bokeh> yeah, let's make everything right-clickable..... more mistery meat navigation is good </sarcasm>
[11:04] <Flosoft> mnepton: here is my config file: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/VaEQRR17.html
[11:04] <tlp__> Juhaz : there were like 30 crappy ones before django
[11:04] <henna_>     morning all of you
[11:04] <henna_>  can i have a cigar of you Bokeh
[11:04] <pibarnas> How can I install gtk-engines from the source on Ubuntu Edgy? They can't compile!
[11:04] <music_man_nz> lol. Right click gives you more options = more friendly
[11:04] <Bokeh> you don't need to delete from your menu, you just uncheck them and they won't show up :)
[11:04] <music_man_nz> yah
[11:05] <Bokeh> mistery meat navigation is never userfriendly
[11:05] <ndowens> ndlovu_: if it has ppp base installed then i should be able to just put the config there and i am done
[11:05] <Bokeh> a cigar?
[11:05] <music_man_nz> So I can have lots of old bogus entries but they are hidden. Nice and clean
[11:05] <Bokeh> a cuban one? :)
[11:05] <pty> Flosoft: sudo apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-mysqli libfcgi-dev
[11:05] <pty> Flosoft: got all them?
[11:05] <Bokeh> yeah, that's a lot cleaner, because you'll never need to search your whole filesystem if you ever want to add an application you removed a while ago
[11:05] <music_man_nz> So right-clicking is bad? Hm. So it is easier for me to find a program to change something rather than right click and do it. Weird Linux logic
[11:05] <valehru> I've got a presario V3000 and
[11:06] <Bokeh> nothing weird about it.... usability design 101
[11:06] <music_man_nz> lol
[11:06] <mnepton> Flosoft: check the bin path. the binary is usually php-cgi not php5-cgi
[11:06] <Bokeh> just because windows and kde do it that way doesn't mean it's the right way to do it :)
[11:06] <music_man_nz> So why does Google include right click menu in its spreadsheets and documents program online?
[11:06] <Flosoft> hmm I did
[11:06] <Flosoft> there were both
[11:06] <music_man_nz> "because you'll never need to search your whole filesystem if you ever want to add an application you removed a while ago" ??? So I could have 30 bogus entries just lying there...
[11:07] <music_man_nz> And that is clean
[11:07] <Bokeh> there is a whole difference between contextual menu's in a spreadsheet or document editor and a applications menu
[11:07] <Bokeh> yes, that's clean, because you'll never SEE those bogus entries
[11:07] <music_man_nz> nonsense, ajax usability 101
[11:07] <music_man_nz> Interact like a desktop application
[11:07] <music_man_nz> rubbish
[11:07] <ndowens> ndlovu_: ppp (2.4.4rel-1ubuntu1) doesn't have universe/multiverse beside it
[11:07] <Bokeh> whatever :)
[11:08] <Bokeh> i think kde is more suited towards your need
[11:08] <music_man_nz> that isn't clean. It is like putting a nice clean cover over a pil;e of rubbish. The rubbish is still there
[11:08] <BlueEagle> ubotu: tell music_man_nz about offtopic
[11:08] <music_man_nz> Didn't Linus say that KDE was better?
[11:08] <Bokeh> if you think that's true, it must be :)
[11:08] <ndlovu_> ndowens, so logically I think you're right - I've just been looking through the forums to see if anyone has reported problems but haven't found anything. So I think you should be good.
[11:08] <music_man_nz> lol
[11:08] <Bokeh> Linus is a kernel developer, not a dm developer
[11:08] <Bokeh> apples/oranges
[11:08] <music_man_nz> I'm procrastinating = arguing
[11:09] <snadge> im glad ubuntu has made gnome its default desktop.. and kubuntu is that other thing that weirdos use ;)
[11:09] <mnepton> music_man_nz: perhaps a better use of your time would be to explore that nice right mouse button >:)
[11:09] <music_man_nz> what?
[11:09] <tlp__> what time do dry cleaners normally open?
[11:09] <Rothguard> lol
[11:09] <fm> hi
[11:10] <Bokeh> anyways.... i'm off to get me a new edgy cd and install it on my development machine
[11:10] <fm> how do I disable automatical gdm start?
[11:10] <tlp__> and how fast can they dry clean stuff
[11:10] <ndowens> ndlovu_: i wish to help out by packaging programs, do u know of a easy way to
[11:10] <BlueEagle> music_man_nz: You're arguing something that's not ubuntu spesific but something regarding preferences and design philosophies afaict, so I think it's more suited for the off-topic channel.
[11:10] <julo> hi
[11:10] <music_man_nz> ok. well I'm going to try studying again. Sorry if I spammed the channel
[11:11] <ndowens> music_man_nz: well just don't do it again, j/k!

[11:11] <julo> Any idea what might go wrong ?
[11:11] <ndowens> julo: firewall maybe, just a guess
[11:11] <mnepton> Flosoft: you have MIME issues
[11:11] <BlueEagle> julo: That sounds like the firewall on the client, not an errror on the server.
[11:12] <Flosoft> well not with my browser
[11:12] <Flosoft> it is something on the server
[11:12] <noelferreira> rt61 driver working on edgy amd64 anyone?
[11:12] <pty> Flosoft: what are the permissions on the files in the web root?
[11:12] <ndlovu_> ndowens, I'd check under http://www.ubuntu.com/community and see if you can find anything there
[11:12] <mnepton> Flosoft: check your php.ini to ensure the changes CGI requires have been done
[11:13] <Flosoft> what changes in php.ini?
[11:13] <Flosoft> drwxr-xr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 2006-10-31 10:32 www

[11:28] <blind> Okay, I have an issue. I started messing around with beryl and I somehow lost my 1280*1024 resolution. In an effort to get it back, I played with my xorg.conf, and actually took out all other resolutions from it. However, all the options are still in the Screen Resolution dialog and I still cannot get 1280*1024. Yes, I restarted X, I even rebooted my computer. It's as if my xorg.conf is not being read. Are there other files that influenc
[11:29] <blind> capi: i log into msn through gaim no problem. a lot of msn issues in gaim are due to msn servers, afaik.

[11:29] <capi> Thank you Blind
[11:29] <blind> tlp_: no clue how to fix it?

[11:30] <blind> tlp_: I DID manually edit my xorg.conf
[11:30] <tlp_> blind : although i think thats not the best way to do it
[11:30] <CarinArr> capi, i had that problem before, solved it by disabling some option in gaim, but can't for the life of me remember which
[11:30] <tlp_> i think doing something like dpkg-reconfigure
[11:30] <blind> tlp_: the only resolution there is 1280*1024
[11:30] <tlp_> whatever X package
[11:30] <tlp_> when it tells you to enter possible modes
[11:30] <blind> dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xotg

[11:36] <sidewalk> and the unrar-command doesnt work for ubuntu
[11:36] <manmadha> It is possible to put a virtual page between the client browser and the actual site..............??It should store the data entered by the client.....

[12:12] <hethu> pty, thanks I'll try (brb)
[12:12] <Kannix> matason: you can define it yourself: alias ll="ls -l".
[12:13] <dcraven> Kannix, Ctrl-Up/Ctrl-Dn cycles tabs.
[12:13] <Kannix> twizmode: Get a md5sum program for XP then.
[12:13] <KJro> or: alias ll="ls-al"
[12:13] <twizmode> ok
[12:13] <matason> Kannix: Ah thanks - so ll and ls are synonamous?
[12:13] <Kannix> dcraven: can I redefine that anywhere?

[12:13] <xxyyzz> What command can you use to change your password via the terminal?

[12:17] <jerb> bugs suck
[12:17] <hethu> pty: I see. will this affect the other sessions like KDE, XGL, ?
[12:17] <Flosoft> hey
[12:17] <pty> hethu: oh, you have a xgl session too?  do you have beryl installed?
[12:18] <julo> I managed to make my ubuntu dial-in server perfectly. I can use to it to ping - say google.com. Now, I have a problem: I have an application running on the dial-in server using port 13212. If I try to access it from the PPP client, it doesn't work. ANy idea ?
[12:18] <hethu> pty: nice question... what's this?
[12:18] <hethu> pty: I'll see in packages
[12:18] <julo> Do I need to manually authorize custom ports on the server ?
[12:18] <Flosoft> I got a question about the pure-ftpd package on dapper: has it been compiled with: --with-largefile
[12:18] <pty> beryl is the new name for compiz
[12:19] <apokryphos> pty: no, it's a *fork* of compiz
[12:19] <hethu> pty: I see.
[12:19] <blind> pty: no it is not.
[12:19] <pty> i know im keeping it simple
=== enzo^_^ is now known as enzo
[12:19] <blind> pty: it is a separate project.
[12:19] <hethu> pty: so, I must remove compiz and install beryl?
[12:19] <apokryphos> pty: by making a completely erroneous statement?
[12:19] <pty> hethu: no, never mind
[12:19] <apokryphos> hethu: beryl is a fork of compiz, not the 'new name' for it.
[12:19] <hethu> apokryphos: I understood, dont fight pls
[12:20] <RancidLM> does any one know how to configure grub so that my monitor isn't "out of sync" ?
[12:20] <Kannix> dcraven: ok, where do I find out what keyword is used for what key? Especially: what keyword is used for curser left and right keys?
[12:20] <hethu> pty: I have installed compiz. is this a problem?
[12:21] <pty> anyway hethu: my guess is that compiz is messing with your metacity starting
[12:21] <hethu> pty: aha
[12:21] <dcraven> Kannix, just Left and Right afaik.
[12:21] <hethu> pty: hm, can i remove pkg compiz and add beryl?
[12:21] <Kannix> dcraven: I tried those. They don't work. Errm, is it case sensitive? Let me try ...
[12:21] <hethu> pty: ..if this will fix things
[12:21] <mnepton> RancidLM: add "vga=787" to the kernel params in menu.lst
[12:22] <defrysk> compiz and beryl dont mix
[12:22] <pty> hethu: i would reccomend it - afaik beryl seems to be more actively developed at the moment
[12:22] <Flosoft> I got a question about the pure-ftpd package on dapper: has it been compiled with: --with-largefile ???
[12:22] <apokryphos> defrysk: they do actually; beryl-manager is even made to handle easy switching between them
[12:22] <RancidLM> mnepton: thanks!
[12:22] <hethu> pty: I see. okey, thanks, I'll try.
[12:22] <pty> hethu: there are lots of tutorials on the forums for installing/configuring beryl

[12:23] <blind> KJro: maybe #sql
[12:23] <Kannix> dcraven: Ok, sorry. They are case sensitive, had small letters. It works now. Thank you for your help.
[12:23] <Steve21> heil hitler
[12:24] <dcraven> Kannix, just fyi, I found out those keys by playing in Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts.
[12:24] <KJro> thx .. i'll try
[12:24] <sentinel> hmm
[12:24] <blind> !coc > Steve21
[12:24] <thee3> Steve21: hail not heil
[12:24] <tapas> ok , imade my initrd image with yaird
[12:24] <Kannix> dcraven: I looked there first, but you cannot set preferences for the terminal there.
[12:24] <tapas> i hope it'll work :)
[12:24] <mnepton> thee3: please do not feed the trolls
[12:24] <sentinel> is there some sort of problem with using the latest nvidia drivers on ubuntu 6.10? the "how to" doesn't appear to work for me
[12:24] <Kannix> dcraven: And yes, it is a nice source to find how keys are described :)
[12:24] <netstar> There was a lot of talk about metacity having compositor enabled in the edgy build, but this doesn't seem to be true.
[12:25] <dcraven> Kannix, :)
[12:25] <thee3> mnepton: OK
[12:25] <Flosoft> I got a question about the pure-ftpd package on dapper: has it been compiled with: --with-largefile ???
[12:25] <blind> netstar: aiglx is 'built into' xorg 7.1
[12:25] <Kannix> sentinel: You have to edit the xorg.conf manually.
[12:25] <Kannix> sentinel: it is totally screwed after installation and does not work any more.
[12:25] <netstar> blind I see, what must one do to enable these effects and selectively?
[12:26] <sentinel> well, I noticed that nvidia-config enable didn't change the driver
[12:26] <blind> netstar: install beryl/compiz
[12:26] <Kannix> sentinel: At least I had to manually change the PCI bus settings back to 1:0:0 and add the right resolution to the screen sections.
[12:26] <sentinel> hmm
[12:26] <Kannix> sentinel: It also changed my keyboard mapping. So pay attention to that, if you experience funny things when typing after enabling the nvidia driver.
[12:27] <Kannix> sentinel: compare the backup xorg.conf with the one added by the nvidia driver installation.
[12:27] <sentinel> yeah, I noticed my keyboard map has switched back to us
[12:27] <nanda> hi
[12:27] <nanda> can someone help me with compiz?
[12:27] <sentinel> problem is
[12:28] <nanda> I installed it and it seems to work, but when activated I cannot resize or move any of my windows
[12:28] <apokryphos> !compiz | nanda
[12:28] <ubotu> nanda: Compiz (compositing (window) manager) and XGL (Xserver architecture layered on top of OpenGL) howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager XGL+compiz help in #ubuntu-xgl  See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[12:28] <Kannix> sentinel: simply copy the backup back into place and just change the driver from "nv" to "nvidia". At least that did it for me :)
=== _yacc_ is now known as yacc
[12:28] <sentinel> Kannix: I tried doing that but it still doesn't appear to work
[12:29] <sentinel> I have a problem with the 'nv' driver to begin with too... which is the reason I need to update it
[12:29] <Kannix> sentinel: can you post your xorg.conf to some pastebin?
[12:29] <sentinel> by default the X server works, but the display is completely distorted
[12:29] <Kannix> sentinel: oops.
[12:29] <Kannix> sentinel: that is not good of course.
[12:29] <Kannix> sentinel: What hardware are you running? GPU?
[12:30] <sentinel> geforce 6800GT
[12:30] <Kannix> sentinel: did you download the nvidia-glx package?
[12:30] <sentinel> the same happens with previous ubuntu installs, but doing the usual apt-get install nvidia-glx and nvidia-config enable always sorted it
[12:30] <sentinel> of course
[12:31] <blind> i thought the "nv" driver was outdated?
[12:31] <sentinel> also
[12:31] <athlon> does  edgy dvd release even  exist ? been searching for a while and found zilch
[12:31] <sentinel> running a terminal from the live CD seems to be quite buggered too
[12:31] <lazzareth> How do 64 bit operating systems go nowdays for support
[12:31] <sentinel> the bottom of the screen doesn't seem to be displayed
[12:31] <XiXaQ> I need to make two domains for 127.0.0.1. How can I do that? first.mybox.tld and second.mybox.tld should both point to 127.0.0.1
[12:32] <apokryphos> lazzareth: pretty good; check the FAQ
[12:32] <sentinel> (switching from one terminal to the other refreshes it though, but it's quite annoying)
[12:32] <Kannix> sentinel: could well be, if there is some problem with the framebuffer device.
[12:32] <lazzareth> i originally tried a 64-bit dapper release when it first came out.. but little harly any programs i needed to run worked (wine & etc)
[12:32] <Kannix> sentinel: However, starting the proper nvidia drivers under X should work.
[12:33] <lazzareth> Ill take your word for it :D, Just Going to upgrade to Edgy tonight, (full reinstall, not update)
[12:33] <Casanova> Has anyone been able to compile a custom kernel on Ubuntu Edgy?
[12:33] <lazzareth> and 64-bit + beryl looks to be the go
[12:33] <blind> lazzareth: good luck
[12:33] <Kannix> lazzareth: Well, I am on AMD64 right now and I don't miss much (except flash player, I wonder why there is no gnash package for ubuntu).
[12:33] <Kannix> lazzareth: Then, however, I am not using any windows software and hence have no need for wine.
[12:34] <mnepton> Kannix: gnash won't do much for you, even if installed. it's stuck at ~Flashv5 functionality
[12:34] <lazzareth> Kannix, What about the new Flash 9 beta player for linux ?
[12:34] <Kannix> mnepton: oh well. I never liked "flash" sites that much anyhow.
[12:34] <lazzareth> is that only x86?
[12:34] <Kannix> lazzareth: No 64Bit version.
[12:34] <netstar> Does it work on powerpc?
[12:34] <netstar> :)
[12:34] <netstar> I wish
[12:34] <Kannix> lazzareth: Seems so.
[12:34] <sentinel> brb
[12:34] <lazzareth> Crap!, How will i play line rider!
[12:35] <sentinel> i'm gonna reboot again so ubuntu is using the completely default configuration for my hardware
[12:35] <lazzareth> Well thats terrbile, Any ETA? because i can live without flash for a month or two.. no longer
[12:35] <Kannix> sentinel: cu
[12:35] <lazzareth> Or ill just run firefox in wine + flash, or firefox in vmware
[12:35] <lazzareth> in windows
[12:35] <gnube> Is there a command, like modprobe, to see if the UVC driver i installed in my kernel?
[12:36] <gnube> If so, what module is the UVC driveer?
[12:36] <Casanova> Has anyone been able to compile a custom kernel on Ubuntu Edgy?
[12:36] <lazzareth> Just a query, If theres an application that is only avaliable in x86 can i build it for 64-bit and get it working 100%?
[12:37] <Kannix> lazzareth: Generally? No. Most of the times? Yes. Depends on what libraries are used and how the code is written.
[12:37] <XiXaQ> Casanova, please don't repeat your question quite as frequently. There are many people here.
[12:37] <Casanova> oops i thought perhaps no one noticed it :)
[12:37] <SoftIce> how can I get mysql to listen remotly?
[12:38] <blind> Okay, I have an issue. I started messing around with beryl and I somehow lost my 1280*1024 resolution. In an effort to get it back, I played with my xorg.conf, and actually took out all other resolutions from it. However, all the options are still in the Screen Resolution dialog and I still cannot get 1280*1024. Yes, I restarted X, I even rebooted my computer. It's as if my xorg.conf is not being read. Are there other files that influenc

[12:46] <siccness> or mv for move
[12:46] <Ace_> ty
[12:46] <Werdna> thanks, mnepton, I'll try that
[12:47] <Werdna> !packages
[12:47] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 18000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[12:47] <uUser610> are they .deb files for vmware?
[12:47] <Werdna> http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/devel/linux-source-2.6.17 <-- that bugger
[12:47] <mnepton> uUser610: not yet
[12:48] <uUser610> mnepton: you belive they come?
[12:48] <sentinel> hmm
[12:48] <sentinel> yeah
[12:48] <mnepton> uUser610: no comment
[12:48] <uUser610> why?
[12:48] <sentinel> default configuration, all I get are what can be described as vertical scanlines
[12:48] <mnepton> uUser610: not something i will comment on in public
[12:49] <uUser610> do beagle index thunderbird right? because fedora-core6 make this very bad

[12:53] <sidewalk> how do i share files with ubuntu, share as in samba ?
[12:54] <Edorka> hi there
[12:54] <sidewalk> anyone?
[12:55] <Edorka> i have just upgraded to edgy but now at Xorg some menu options and text on applications is not show unless i pass the mouse over it, any one know how can i fix this?
[12:55] <cyron> sidewalk: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Share_files_using_Samba
[12:57] <sidewalk> tnx, but i wanna browse shares etc
[12:57] <xinming_> which package is used for sudo and remembering password please?
[12:58] <xinming_> eg, If you ever sudo, then, Your privilege would be remembered
[12:58] <memeticvirus> where can I find a list of packages availble via apt-get?
[12:58] <apokryphos> memeticvirus: apt-cache search, or just open up synaptic
[12:58] <memeticvirus> ah, thank you.
[12:59] <Cyron> sidewalk: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/HowToMountsmbfsSharesPermanently
[01:00] <sheri_rao> i wud love to migrate to ubuntu, if i could run 1 software(that i currently run on windows)
[01:00] <mamzers555> sheri_rao; which is this
[01:00] <dcraven> xinming_, I'm not sure what you are asking, but you can configure sudo using visudo.
[01:01] <memeticvirus> I can't seem to get flash player to install. The config script returns with, "ERROR: Your architecture, \'x86_64\', is not supported[...] "
[01:01] <gnube> I am hoping to install the logitech 5000 web cam. I am downloading the kernel source and have checkedout the svn code from the UVC repo, is this going to be sufficient?
[01:01] <sentinel> hmm
[01:02] <dcraven> memeticvirus, what is your arch?
[01:02] <memeticvirus> AMD64
[01:02] <dcraven> memeticvirus, and read the error again :)
[01:02] <Afief> sheri_rao: which software?
[01:02] <xinming_> dcraven: What I mean is, when you sudo in ubuntu, the system remembers your privilege, and at the next time when you type 'sudo apt-get blablabla' again, You don't need to type the password again.
[01:02] <sheri_rao> how do u run some window-base software on linux, i know there is something called WINE
[01:02] <memeticvirus> yes, i understand the error. but is there a solution?
[01:02] <Casanova> does someone face this error when compiling the kernel on edgy? http://pastebin.ca/230681
[01:03] <sentinel> anyone else having problems with nvidia drivers on 6.10?
[01:03] <Afief> sheri_rao: install wine(instructions at www.winehq.com) and run $ wine [insert executable] 
[01:03] <gnube> sheri_rao, Running Windows software on linux is possible, but it is hard for beginners. How much experience do you have with Ubuntu?
[01:03] <kanzie> Is there any use updating Dapper to Edgy if one is perfectly happy with Dapper (except for the bluetooth-support)
[01:04] <dcraven> xinming_, hmm.. I'm not sure. That kinda defeats the purpose of sudo I think.
[01:05] <dcraven> kanzie, not if you're perfectly happy, I don't think so.
[01:05] <kanzie> dcraven: Where is a good list of what is new?
[01:06] <dcraven> kanzie, probably the release notes. Check the ubuntu wiki.
[01:06] <dcraven> !wiki
[01:06] <ubotu> wiki is http://wiki.ubuntu.com - Loads of user-contributed documentation
[01:07] <dcraven> !new
[01:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about new - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:07] <Werdna> hey, I'm trying to install ndiswrapper from source, and it wants files in /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/build -- I have the linux-headers and linux-source packages installed. What do I need?
[01:08] <xinming_> dcraven: Did you use ubuntu? >_<
[01:08] <Afief> kanzie: i think bluetooth support(as in driver) belongs to the kernel stuff. you might want to check if it's in 2.6.17 on kernel newbies
[01:08] <dcraven> xinming_, yes.
[01:08] <xinming_> dcraven: If you did, please try 'sudo apt-get update' then 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
[01:08] <xinming_> The first would ask you to type password, but the second won't
[01:09] <xinming_> I just want to know which package can handle this
[01:09] <dcraven> xinming_, yes I know. That's sudo.
[01:09] <dcraven> xinming_, you can configure sudo with visudo.
[01:09] <memeticvirus> why the hell doesn't macromedia/adobe support 64bit procs... idiots.
[01:09] <Edorka> hi again
[01:10] <Edorka> is anyone having troubles with edgy, nvidia and text that doesnt appear?
[01:10] <kanzie> Afief: Do I manually check synaptic for updates
[01:10] <xinming_> dcraven: Is that feature can be configured?
[01:10] <chad> running winxp in vmware and playing 2 diffrent divx movies in xp..and still vmware only uses 3% cpu??
[01:10] <Afief> memticvirus: they were saying something about large portions of the code being 32bit specific. but if that's true their devs truely need dist-upgrade for their minds
[01:11] <xinming_> dcraven: I thought It should be in a daemon...
[01:11] <xinming_> dcraven: I don't think can be done only through sudo really
[01:11] <Afief> kanzie: nope, why should you? the update manager takes care of it, and if you like CLI do this: apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
[01:13] <mnepton> if this had been a real emergency, oxygen masks would have dropped from the ceiling in front of you .......
[01:13] <chad> Oo
[01:13] <dcraven> xinming_, man sudoers
[01:15] <xinming_> dcraven: well, I've man-ed it. but It doesn't give me the information about how to save the password for a *short-time*
[01:16] <noela> hi
[01:16] <xinming_> I don't want user to be able to sudo without root password
[01:16] <ketsugi> xinming_: Remove the user from the sudo group
[01:17] <chad> running winxp in vmware and playing 2 diffrent divx movies in xp..and still vmware only uses 3% cpu?? how is that possible?
[01:17] <xinming_> ketsugi: well, I think you don't understand what my question is... >_<
[01:17] <xinming_> chad: that's because of the driver IMHO
[01:18] <chad> driver?
[01:18] <ketsugi> What's your question, then?
[01:18] <saint__> hello, does anyone know if it's possible to span my desktop across two monitors using two differend resolutions?  emphesis on the differend resolutions. (ati radeon 9550)
[01:19] <chad> saint_ i did that once
[01:19] <chad> but it was with nvidia twinview
[01:19] <chad> dunno about ati..but it should be possible
[01:20] <Flamekebab> You know the Firefox flash-related crash bug in Edgy?
[01:20] <Vanuatoo> 6.10 does not boot neither with normal boot nor safe graphics mode. I've ATI Radeon X850XT PCIe
[01:21] <Flamekebab> ..and how it can be fixed by editing /etc/firefox/firefoxrc ?
[01:21] <Vanuatoo> Ubuntu does not like ATI I guess
[01:21] <xinming_> ketsugi: Which package contains the function like this...  When user use sudo, and the system remember it for a short period. and then, in the short period, You don't need to type the password again to use sudo.
[01:21] <Flamekebab> how can I do the same fix on Flock?
[01:22] <ketsugi> xinming_: that's just the way sudo works
[01:23] <xinming_> ...
[01:24] <_hiphop_> what is the command in terminal to copy the contents of a folder over the contenets of another folder i tried just copying the folder over the other one it just said omitiing directory or something

[01:37] <sheri_rao> i wud love to switch to ubuntu but i have problem with 1 software that i always have to run on windows ? any suggestion ?
[01:37] <scamboy> sheri: wat software??
[01:38] <joona> sheri_rao: depends on software, you have numerous choices
[01:38] <joona> qemu, vmware, crossover office, wine
[01:38] <defrysk> sheri_rao, http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software
[01:38] <sheri_rao> scamboy, that is my trading platform
[01:39] <Kannix> Hi again, is there any plugin wrapper that enables 32bit browser plugins for firefox in ubuntu AMD64? Something like nspluginwrapper in Gentoo?
[01:39] <sipo> hello all
[01:39] <sheri_rao> joona,  i have heard about wine but i dont know much
[01:39] <concept10> sheri_rao, what do you mean 'trading platform' ?
[01:39] <joona> sheri_rao: it just transforms win32 api to X11
[01:40] <sipo> i hav a problem with the AMILO M1425 laptop, it's frezzing durning the reboot process
[01:40] <disasm> when will I be able to join #ubuntu+1 again? or is dev moving to a different channel?
[01:40] <joona> sheri_rao: if you intend to run a small non-complex program, wine of cxoffice could be your choice
[01:40] <scamboy> sipo: ram problem??
[01:40] <ketsugi> disasm: When Feisty firms up a bit more
[01:40] <sipo> no possible
[01:40] <ketsugi> probably in a month or more
[01:40] <joona> but if you need more complex ones, i suggest you to install windows in virtual machine ( vmware, qemu)
[01:40] <disasm> ketsugi: is that the new code name?
[01:40] <rambo3> disasm there is no ubuntu+1 today wait some time
[01:40] <sipo> the ram workin fine under windows
[01:40] <ketsugi> Feisty Fawn
[01:40] <ketsugi> 7.04
[01:41] <disasm> good name ;-)
[01:41] <evolux> my system (edgy) freezes while booting, just after "Activating raid arrays" with the message "soft lockup detected on cpu#0". it has worked before and i made the first software suspend on edgy before this happened. can someone help me?
[01:41] <scamboy> sipo how much ram??/ maybe got application clash...
[01:41] <sipo> 1 GB
[01:41] <ketsugi> scamboy: You Singaporean?
[01:41] <scamboy> wow...then not ram problem..
[01:41] <scamboy> ketsugi: malaysian
[01:42] <ketsugi> Hmm, close enough
[01:42] <scamboy> u?
[01:42] <ketsugi> Singaporean
[01:42] <ndlovu> I'm trying to learn some scripting basics, but it's not going so well! Can someone please look at this script and tell me why I'm getting a "syntax error near unexpected token `echo'"? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29525/
[01:42] <sipo> scamboy, the problem perssit only when I reboot
[01:42] <scamboy> nice to see a singaporean here....
[01:42] <snadge> is it normal for "Regenerating fonts cache..." part of dist-upgrade to edgy, to take about 20 mins to do per ttf package?
[01:42] <sipo> all other things are workine wonderful
[01:43] <scamboy> i had that problem on hibernate...
[01:43] <snadge> at this rate.. it will take all week to update
[01:43] <defrysk> snadge, dist-upgrades sometimes take a loooong time
[01:43] <Kannix> ndlovu: You need a semicolon
[01:43] <Kannix> ndlovu: after the for... before the do
[01:43] <defrysk> snadge, that why I have a seperate /home partition so I can just simply reinstall
[01:44] <ndlovu> Kannix, thanks!
[01:44] <defrysk> or install a later version
[01:44] <ndlovu> Kannix, great, step 1 works!
[01:44] <snadge> defrysk, ahh well .. it will finish eventually, perhaps one day fontconfig can be removed.. or just extracted instead of running and taking half an hour
[01:44] <scamboy> when upgade to 6.06 will i lost my current data??
[01:44] <Kannix> ndlovu: Please consider http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
[01:45] <scamboy> coz i need 2 download the latest drapper on new cd right??
[01:46] <ndlovu> Kannix, I'm actually looking at that; they don't use the semicolon, but probably a newline does the same
[01:47] <ndlovu> Kannix, yup - it seems either semicolon or newline fix the error
[01:47] <Gecko> Hey, what do I use to convert ps to pdf?
[01:47] <dcraven> Gecko, ps2pdf
[01:47] <Kannix> ndlovu: Yes. It clearly says so in the chapter "loops": If do is on same line as for, there needs to be a semicolon after list. for arg in [list]  ; do"
[01:47] <ndlovu> Kannix, thanks
[01:47] <Gecko> dcraven: in which package?
[01:47] <mnepton> Kannix: bash scripting tutorials will not help someone on Ubuntu explicitly calling /bin/sh ;)
[01:48] <Fade> gecko : apt-cache search ps2pdf
[01:48] <Kannix> mnepton: I thought that is a symlink to bash?
[01:49] <xinming_> dcraven: thanks, Now, I just found the answer on the google. add !tty_tickets to Default
[01:49] <Gecko> Fade: seems only to exist as a part of tex
[01:49] <evolux> can someone tell me the location of the (upstart?) script that mounts root filesystem and assembles raid devices?
[01:49] <Fade> when bash is called as /bin/sh it acts like bourne shell.
[01:49] <Fade> Gecko: makes sense
[01:49] <kzm> Anybody use ion as WM?  It doesn't seem to find its fonts anymore.
[01:49] <mnepton> Kannix: sh is symlinked to dash as of Edgy
[01:49] <Fade> eww
[01:50] <zoetrope666> Does anyone know about how to resolve modem issues on toshiba laptops? I have a portege 4010, and in order to connect to the internet i have to execute two commands in an open terminal.
[01:50] <Kannix> mnepton: dash? Never heared of it. I thought it is a washing powder :)
[01:50] <mnepton> if you want bash style syntax functionality, call it explicitly
[01:50] <zoetrope666> i wonder if theres a way of bypassing this.. perhaps by inserting these commands into a text document somewhere in the file structure?
[01:50] <Gecko> Fade: ah, it's also in gs-common
[01:50] <SoftIce> how can i downgrade from edgy to dapper, do I just change repositories
[01:50] <Zambezi> Any OP here? Someone did the nazicross in the Swedishchannel. I want him banned for ever from Freenode.
[01:50] <Kannix> mnepton: Ok, calling /bin/bash is the safe way.
[01:50] <Fade> you can't downgrade a debian system.
[01:50] <mnepton> Kannix: 'zackly
[01:50] <gandolfthewizard> gm all i was woundering if there is a cd burning software that will burn mp3 into an audio format
[01:50] <SoftIce> Fade: I eheard you can, just not safe
[01:51] <mnepton> Zambezi: #ubuntu-ops
[01:51] <Fade> if you want to move backward, wipe out /usr/ /var/ and reinstall without formatting.
[01:51] <SoftIce> no other option?
[01:51] <Fade> apt doesn't have any facility to move backwards through dependency graphs.
[01:51] <Kannix> ndlovu: So either start your scripts with #!/bin/bash or observe the syntax of the "shell du jour" as in the symlink.
[01:51] <defrysk> gandolfthewizard,  serpentine
[01:51] <SmrtJustin> I just upgraded to edgy, and now I can't use 1024x768 resolution, it pushes my monitor out of its frequency range.  1280x1024 works, but only at 60Hz.
[01:51] <Fade> you can force overwrite, but that can and likely will pooch the system on a global operation on every package.
[01:51] <gandolfthewizard> i just tried that but it said in proper formate
[01:52] <EdsipeR> hey
[01:52] <Kannix> mnepton: any idea how dash differs from bash?
[01:52] <EdsipeR> how can I fix the avahi bug in 6.10 ?
[01:52] <Fade> it's probably smaller.
[01:52] <defrysk> gandolfthewizard, get the proper mp3 plugins
[01:52] <Fade> it likely doesn't link to glibc.
[01:52] <Kannix> mnepton: Where do I find docs on that? Besides the "man dash"?
[01:52] <defrysk> !mp3

[01:52] <zoetrope666> Does anyone know about how to resolve modem issues on toshiba laptops? I have a portege 4010, and in order to connect to the internet i have to execute two commands in an open terminal.  i wonder if theres a way of bypassing this.. perhaps by inserting these commands into a text document somewhere in the file structure?
[01:53] <kzm> ...and by the way, X dies when I switch to console.
[01:53] <Fade> kikokos : the permissions/ownership on your home directory are probably wrong.
[01:53] <EdsipeR> zoetrope666, maybe /etc/rc.local
[01:53] <Ych> !xinerama
[01:53] <ubotu> xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo

[01:53] <kikokos_> fade, so what should I do?
[01:53] <zoetrope666> ok thanks
[01:53] <ndlovu> Kannix, actually I was using #!/bin/bash  - just checked to see if sh might work when bash was failing

[01:57] <ClayG> anyone know of softwre for ubuntu that can do invoice for lets say, comptuer repairs/services?
[01:57] <EdsipeR> zoetrope666, push your code there
[01:57] <klaas> ehm no its already installed etc its an error message by java
[01:57] <ClayG> i tried kmymoney2, grisbi, gnucash, no dic

[01:57] <ClayG> lol
[01:57] <zoetrope666> EdsipeR: /etc/rc.local appears to be an executable file, not a text document?
[01:57] <kridian> shell script, its text too
[01:57] <kikokos_> nothing
[01:57] <Fade> ClayG: freshmeat has about two hundred invoicing programs listed.
[01:57] <kikokos_> maybe another suggest
[01:58] <zoetrope666> EdsipeR: how do i 'push code' ? sorry im a newbie
[01:58] <kikokos_> Once again: I can see in Gnome just wallpaper no icons no stripes

[01:58] <Fade> kikokos: what is in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[01:58] <EdsipeR> zoetrope666, read a document about linux system permission
[01:58] <kikokos_> wait i check it
[01:59] <Cyron> Though I believe that will lead to it running automatically when you login to your ubuntu session, not specifically when you are trying to dial out

[01:59] <ClayG> but i'll look into that, rather get a recommendation from someone who uses/ has used this type of software for what i want
[01:59] <Vladaz> has anyone installed ati drivers?
[01:59] <zoetrope666> was that re: my dilemma, cyron? your last comment that is
[01:59] <Vladaz> ati graphics

[02:00] <Kream> hi all
[02:00] <Kream> How do I install fonts while using the console?
[02:00] <kikokos_> fade I have two file old and "normal" log which one is the good one?
[02:00] <dcraven> Kream, you can put them in ~/.fonts I think.
[02:00] <Fade> the one that doesn't have 'old' appended to the end of it's name.
[02:01] <brynk_> Kream: for one user do what dcraven says
[02:01] <Fade> kikokos_: also, try moving ~/.gnome* out of the way to new filenames and restart gnome.
[02:01] <Fade> s/filenames/dirnames
[02:01] <Kream> brynk_, dcraven : thanks :) but I'm looking to install systemwide
[02:01] <Cyron> Yes it was zoetrope666
[02:02] <brynk_> Kream: /usr/share/fonts
[02:02] <Kream> I'm actually remastering a cd (so have chrooted into the filesystem and am root)

[02:02] <kikokos_> fade I show you on private what I have on log
[02:02] <Fade> paste it to pastebin
[02:02] <Kream> doesnt it have someting to do with defoma?
[02:02] <Fade> and then give me the link.
[02:03] <Fade> Kream -- moving from breezy or dapper to edgy will leave you with a bjorked fontpath in your xorg.conf.

[02:04] <Qew> can anyone tell me for sure whether in /boot/grub/menu.lst you should remove the splash paramater or use "nosplash" if you want to get rid of the splash? Is there a "correct" way to do this or would omitting "splash" be fine?

[02:08] <Fade> defoma is used in ubuntu.
[02:08] <Fade> theoretically all fonts should be defoma managed now.
[02:08] <kikokos_> it`s to me fade?

[02:08] <pluto> Hello.  Who can help me upgrade to firefox 2.0.  I've downloaded the file, unzipped it, but don't know which file will launch setup.
[02:08] <Kream> do i have to manually run defoma if i'm installing by hand using a console or do does the system invoke it, Fade, brynk_ , dcraven ?

[02:38] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: I have no idea... I upgrade it when I was asleep and it said that it wanted my password so I just entered it and it tells me it's the wrong pass
[02:38] <teledyn> Supremacygnu: what asked you for a password and what was the message?
[02:39] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: the update manager asked me for password
[02:39] <snadge> do i want to install ubuntu-minimal after an upgrade to edgy?
[02:39] <teledyn> Supremacygnu: try to bit a bit less ambiguous.  its not fun to try to guess what is going on with your system.  you have to tell us the specifics
[02:39] <Fade> snadge: that probably won't get you anything. ;)
[02:40] <teledyn> Supremacygnu: and at that point you rebooted?

[02:40] <daNET3344> hey, do you know how to install wine in ubuntu 6.10
[02:40] <snadge> it wants to remove sysvinit hehe
[02:40] <Fade> probably because it's going to force remove and try to replace inline things like your clibrary and your shell.
[02:40] <teledyn> daNET3344: apt-get install wine  ?
[02:41] <Fade> and it's right. you shouldn't do that.
[02:41] <daNET3344> ok i hav done it
[02:41] <elkbuntu> idefix, non-support talk should go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:41] <kikokos_> fade, i try my gnome now
[02:41] <idefix> okok but how do I restart cups?
[02:41] <kikokos_> i`ll tell how it is
[02:41] <Fade> kikokos_: did you see the paste I made?
[02:42] <teledyn> idefix: /etc/init.d/cupsys restart
[02:42] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: alright, Well. I do rememeber that it said something about an error but I ignored it and continued. When I was back I typed my password in and it failed. I checked my update manager and it said I had something wrong which I could fix with dpkg --status -a or something, but it didn't work since it didn't want to accept my password. So I went in to this irc channel and they said I'd probably reboot and start recovery mode. Noth
[02:42] <Fade> I commented out the wacom sections because your log was erroring out on them.
[02:42] <kikokos_> fade, i have seen it
[02:42] <kikokos_> should i copy the correct one?
[02:42] <Fade> uhm..

[02:42] <teledyn> Supremacygnu: was this a major upgrade?
[02:42] <Fade> I don't know what you mean.
[02:43] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: yes
[02:43] <Fade> the paste I linked is a complete xorg.conf file. move the old one out of the way and put that one in its place.
[02:43] <kikokos_> so i should onl;y compare them
[02:43] <idefix> is ubuntu really the logical continuing of the once to cool and easy operatable DOS?
[02:43] <teledyn> Supremacygnu: and can you mount the filesystem from the install cd?
[02:43] <Fade> as you wish
[02:43] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: so I have kinda given up hope for upgrading. And now I want to save my files
[02:43] <Supremacygnu> teledyn: no. 1 sec
[02:44] <nolimitsoya> idefix, no? they arent related in any way
[02:44] <idefix> ok
[02:44] <teledyn> idefix: hell no

[02:47] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: it's me supremacygnu. Don't know what happend with my irc client... well, It was I who had problems with my filesystem after upgrading to edgy
[02:47] <teledyn> Supremacygn1: i'm here.  why can't you mount the filesystem?
[02:48] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: woah! euhm... I can now... :S
[02:48] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: can't reach my home folder though
[02:48] <ronin2> so...  my goal for the day is to learn (from scratch) enough php to make a webpage that pulls records from a mysql database and makes a table out of them.  Anyone know of a concise tutorial?  Can anyone recommend a suitable web development IDE, or is vi more than good enough?
[02:49] <david__> hello
[02:49] <teledyn> Supremacygn1: did you put /home in a separate partition?

[02:49] <david__> just upgraded to edgy, something changed with /etc/network/options ?
[02:49] <funkja> ronin2: I learned on this tutorial - http://www.freewebmasterhelp.com/tutorials/phpmysql
[02:49] <idefix> teledyn sorry I switched dirs first and then executed

[02:51] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: yeah, it worked!
[02:51] <teledyn> idefix: check out the cups homepage and look for an entry for your printer model.  maybe they have tips on setting it up.  and check the web interface i told you about.

[02:52] <teledyn> Supremacygn1: in the future, if you are in the middle of a major system upgrade, be careful about rebooting.  try to make the upgrade complete first otherwise it could leave your system in a broken state.
[02:53] <teledyn> Supremacygn1: sure.  where do you want to save them to?  another disk or another machine on the network?
[02:53] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: ok, I don't think I will upgrade with apt-get anymore.. too risky. I think I'll use cds in the future
[02:53] <king_arthur> Sorry guys, the last upgrade broke my usplash, any suggestions?
[02:53] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: the thing is. I only have one disk... and my router is broken :(
[02:53] <teledyn> Supremacygn1: no its not risky.  its just that you probably should not have rebooted in the middle of the upgrade
[02:53] <Supremacygn1> teledyn: ok

[03:01] <kleinlappies> i have a bomber of a question. when i put my PC on the screen goes on and then just disappears (goes blank). if i put the monitor off and on again i can see the screen 4 a sec or 2 and then it disappears again. i have replaced the video card and it still does the same thing. its not ubuntu as this happens from when the pc starts up.
[03:02] <Alzi2_> Guys, I have chosen to share a folder but when I try to access it from out of windows, it asks for a password. I input my username and password and it says it's incorrect. Anyone?

[03:02] <g8m> Alzi2, do you use samba
[03:02] <dxdemetriou> before the Edgy if I had a power lost I used the "shutdown -F now", but now doesn't work. how can I make fsck.ext3 on Edgy?
[03:03] <Lorax> Alzi2_: you also need the workgroup or domain
[03:03] <Alzi2_> g8m: yes
[03:03] <LiraNuna> Alzi2_, try root and root password maybe/
[03:03] <Alzi2_> LiraNuna: Tried. Didn't work
[03:03] <kleinlappies> jvolkman, no you think i could be that? will try that now. thanks
[03:03] <g8m> did you add the user with smbpasswd -a ?

[03:03] <feydin> its starting fine, but i got no window decoration
[03:03] <jvolkman> kleinlappies, well if it happens without booting ubuntu, and you've tried a different video card, that would be my third guess
[03:04] <meheren> Alzi2_, it's becaues of the fact that widblows sends your pass and name in all caps but linux is case sensitive...
[03:04] <g8m> Alzi2, open terminal and add the windows user and password with smbpasswd
[03:04] <meheren> *winblows
[03:04] <Alzi2_> meheren: ... it does?
[03:04] <jvolkman> feydin, it should work in AIGLX

[03:04] <kleinlappies> jvolkman, thanks man will try that quickly
[03:05] <feydin> jvolkman, maybe its because i run cedega in a 32-bit chroot enviroment?

[03:31] <dcraven> flux-89, any chance the page you are crashing on are heavy in the flash departement?
[03:31] <flux-89> dcraven, what do u mean?
[03:31] <dcraven> flux-89, can you give an example of a faulty URL?
[03:32] <flux-89> www.pazintys.lt www.delfi.lt
[03:32] <dwa> how did you install the plugins flux-89 ?
[03:32] <flux-89> dwa, through mozillas browser
[03:32] <nashnash> someone knows where is the "MaxCopies" Settings of cups on my pc? ubuntu 6.10 , Thanks !
[03:32] <Pawliko> hi all
[03:32] <dwa> hi Pawster
[03:33] <mamzers555> hello i plug in usb-dvb-t and it gets detected, lsusb shows: Bus 005 Device 005: ID 14aa:0222 AVerMedia (again) or C&E
[03:33] <dwa> flux-89, try installing flash from the repositories
[03:33] <mamzers555> but the firmware gets not loaded, what can i do?
[03:33] <mamzers555> in dapper it worked
[03:33] <mamzers555> i put the firmware to /lib/firmware
[03:33] <mamzers555> so what i wrong?
[03:33] <brynk_> it's broken, buy a new one
[03:34] <brynk_> :)\
[03:34] <dcraven> flux-89, yeah, like dwa says. Try installing the flashplugin-nonfree package or something.
[03:34] <alek> hello
[03:34] <JuJuBee> Hey all.  Seen  lots of talk bout edgy.  Should we upgrade from dapper or wait?
[03:34] <brynk_> why wait?
[03:34] <JuJuBee> I am somewhat of linux noob (<1yr).
[03:34] <alek> how is the name of the text editor in ubuntu server?
[03:34] <brynk_> it doesn't get any more finished
[03:35] <dwa> and if that doesn't work flux-89, search the forums for flash player 9 and install that.
[03:35] <alek> not any graphical editor;] 
[03:35] <dcraven> alek, try "vim"
[03:35] <JuJuBee> So why doesn't the upgrade manager update to edgy?
[03:35] <alek> o
[03:35] <jcanfield> I need help fixing the client auth documentation for edgy.  I have almost got it working but a couple small problems.  I can authenticate everywhere except through gdm.
[03:35] <mamzers555> ok, found out the problem myself
[03:35] <dcraven> alek, or "nano" maybe.
[03:35] <alek> im a looser O_O
[03:35] <alek> +
[03:35] <jcanfield> LDAP client auth*
[03:35] <alek> oo nano
[03:35] <alek> this is the name i wanted to know
[03:35] <dwa> nano sucks, vim rules!
[03:35] <dwa> ;)
[03:36] <jcanfield> nano is grat for the noobs.
[03:36] <brynk_> vi rocks w00t
[03:36] <alek> dwa two?:P
[03:36] <Flats> If I have a printer setup in Cups, Can I share it for use with a windowsPC withOUT setting up Samba?
[03:36] <dwa> no, i'm not polish
[03:37] <Moodles> what's the proper way to update the grub boot 'menu.lst'.. edit the 'menu.lst' and then type 'update-grub'?
[03:37] <alek> so why you know that two means dwa?:P
[03:37] <alek> do you know*
[03:37] <dwa> because you're not the first one to ask alek :)
[03:37] <alek> hrhrhr
[03:38] <dcraven> JuJuBee, if you want to upgrade to Edgy, do 'gksu "update-manager -c'
[03:38] <alek> so change your nick to ciota for example:P
[03:38] <dcraven> Flats, yes you can.
[03:38] <brynk_> i read something about dist-upgrades not going so well in edgy, or is that fixed already?
[03:39] <Flats> Is it difficult to setup?
[03:39] <dcraven> Flats, no, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingFromWinXP
[03:40] <Flats> dcraven: Thanks
[03:40] <AlanHaggai> can I install KDE in Ubuntu?
[03:40] <dcraven> AlanHaggai, yes.
[03:40] <bergelin> sudo apt-get insatll kubuntu-desktop
[03:40] <Alakazamz0r> AlanHaggai, sudo apt YEEEEEEEEAH!
[03:40] <AlanHaggai> dcraven : how is it done?
[03:40] <bergelin> install*
[03:40] <defrysk> brink_ I upgraded one from dapper to edgy went fine just had probs with opera browser but after removal all went fine , just make sure to have no strange packages and after dist-upgrade run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[03:40] <dcraven> AlanHaggai, see bergelin's message.
[03:41] <motin_> is there no #ubuntu+1 any longer?
[03:41] <AlanHaggai> thanks :)
[03:41] <dcraven> motin_, give the devs some time to rest :)
[03:41] <dwa> not for a while motin_
[03:41] <horne1> Hello, i am installing Ubuntu but the formatting tool does not allow deleting old partitions on my external USB harddisk. Is that normal ?
[03:42] <defrysk> brynk_, no guarantee for suces tho
[03:42] <AlanHaggai> after installing KDE in Ubuntu, will I be given the option to use Gnome too?
[03:42] <defrysk> AlanHaggai, yes
[03:42] <dcraven> AlanHaggai, yes.
[03:42] <defrysk> .
[03:42] <AlanHaggai> thanks defrysk and dcraven :)
[03:42] <dwa> friesland boppe!
[03:42] <scythe12> I am trying to update breezy to edgy, is all I have to do is change any reference to breezy to edgy in my sources.list and then do an apt-get dist-upgrade right?
[03:43] <AlanHaggai> Since I am a newbie, please tell me the difference between Gnome and KDE
[03:43] <scythe12> or do I have to do an apt-get update first?
[03:43] <raconteur> Is swiftfox a good alternative browser for ubuntu?
[03:43] <defrysk> AlanHaggai, check it out yourself , its a diff flavour
[03:43] <horne1> scythe, don't upgrade, make a new install. Upgrading is very buggy.
[03:43] <brynk_> i'm good defrysk, it's just that JuJuBee was asking about upgrading, so i was wondering if that was a good idea
[03:43] <SpComb> some people swear by one, others swear by the other... and then real men swear by ion3!
[03:43] <dcraven> AlanHaggai, use google. They are completely different desktop environments.
[03:43] <AlanHaggai> ok defrysk and dcraven
[03:43] <scythe12> home, I am not blowing out my box
[03:43] <AlanHaggai> will try :)
[03:43] <defrysk> brynk_, fresh install (after backup) is usually quicker
[03:44] <xerophyte> is there anyway i can change all the users passwords other changing using passwd ??
[03:44] <dcraven> AlanHaggai, if you decide you don't like it, there is no need to continue using it.
[03:44] <nashnash> where the cups.conf need to be? thanks
[03:44] <AlanHaggai> how to remove?
[03:44] <defrysk> brynk_, easyest I think is to use a seperate /home partition to be safe for for later upgrades
[03:44] <ghenry> I'm trying to compile something on breezy server, and keep getting: could not locate libtool -lltdl
[03:44] <richee> !fonts

[03:45] <nashnash> brynk_ after i update it i need to restart the cups daemons?
[03:45] <dwa> xerophyte, why would you not want to use passwd?
[03:45] <dwa> it;s the fastest way to change passwords
[03:45] <nashnash> i mean the samba daemons
[03:45] <nashnash> root@apkcfs1:/# /etc/init.d/samba restart
[03:45] <nashnash> * Stopping Samba daemons... [ ok ]

[03:47] <xerophyte> dwa is there anyway i can change all the users passwod to some random password
[03:47] <dcraven> xerophyte, look in the Administration menu.. There is a users and groups tool there if you'd rather use that.
[03:47] <dwa> xerophyte, and then what?
[03:47] <dcraven> dwa, guessing is fun :P
[03:48] <dwa> hehe
[03:48] <xerophyte> dwa one of my client lose the labtop which has the users passwrods in it .. i need to change all the users password to random password and reset them
[03:48] <dwa> i don't know a tool that can do that for you
[03:48] <landmark> Hello, when i try to boot new ubuntu 6.10 from disc, see what happen: http://img289.imageshack.us/my.php?image=erroryn4.gif , im using laptop toshiba video: intel 945GM , screen: 17" 1440x900 is there any boot option to skip/fix that? thanks.
[03:48] <nmbooker> Anyone know how to change the console keymap on Edgy?
[03:49] <penguin42> nmbooker: Well it used to be dpkg-reconfigure console-data - don't know if that is true for edgy
[03:49] <viciousbebop> yo
[03:50] <nashnash> brynk_ is there a chance to get ur cups.conf ?
[03:50] <nmbooker> penguin42: nick@deepthought:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data
[03:50] <nmbooker> Package `console-data' is not installed and no info is available.
[03:50] <nmbooker> Use dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files,
[03:50] <nmbooker> and dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list their contents.
[03:50] <nmbooker> /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: console-data is not installed
[03:50] <nashnash> i try to make MaxCopies 5000 but it still make only 1 copy per 1 printer jobs .. it doesnt let me to make 2+ copies
[03:50] <brynk_> nashnash: what are you trying to do?
[03:50] <penguin42> hmm thats curous - kscd has started making the panel item get highlighted every few seconds
[03:51] <viciousbebop> when I install ubuntu is everything preety much plug and play?
[03:51] <viciousbebop> like I use onboard lan/sound etc
[03:51] <penguin42> nmbooker: Hmm I seem to have it - but I've done an upgrade not a fresh install
[03:51] <dwa> yes viciousbebop
[03:51] <penguin42> viciousbebop: Yeh it should be
[03:51] <Kannix> viciousbebop: it is pretty much PnP.
[03:51] <brynk_> nashnash: try looking at /etc/cups/printers.conf
[03:51] <viciousbebop> like even with windows I have to install a driver for my onboard lan/sound for it to work
[03:51] <dcypherd> what are the new features in 6.10?  Is it worth upgrading from 6.06
[03:52] <Kannix> viciousbebop: But you can always check that because Ubuntu comes as a live distro (runs from CD).
[03:52] <nmbooker> penguin42: Fresh install (kept up to date from Edgy Beta anyway)
[03:52] <viciousbebop> im just gonna dual boot xp/ubuntu
[03:52] <Kannix> viciousbebop: No driver install under Ubuntu.
[03:52] <nashnash> brynk_ i dont have any "MaxCopies" setting there, do you?
[03:52] <viciousbebop> I hear ubuntu is good with auto detecting stuff
[03:52] <Kannix> viciousbebop: Just put in the CD, and boot it to see if it works for you. It does not install before you start the installation from within ubuntu.
[03:52] <vilefridge> Hello.  I'm ready to install Edgy, but dmraid doesn't seem to map my RAID0 volume.  I found this thread: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/dmraid/+bug/54246       All I can do is wait until this is fixed?  When the bug is fixed, how will I proceed with the current build of the 6.10 disc, if it doesn't include the fix?
[03:53] <brynk_> nashnash: i don't have a printer set up atm, so i can't look at it for you
[03:53] <viciousbebop> so I can boot from the cd?
[03:53] <viciousbebop> coo
[03:53] <dcypherd> what are the new features in 6.10?  Is it worth upgrading from 6.06
[03:53] <nmbooker> penguin42: It it worth installing the package?  Console keymap's about as broken as it can be anyway :(
[03:53] <Dinho> salve
[03:53] <nashnash> ok thanks brynk_
[03:54] <penguin42> nmbooker: If it is that broken perhaps :-) I've never known a debian distro without it
[03:54] <dwa> dcypherd, 6.10 has a great mahjongg upgrade
[03:54] <viciousbebop> is it start or install ubuntu
[03:54] <viciousbebop> or boot from first hard disk
[03:54] <penguin42> dwa: :-)
[03:54] <Cashel> dcypherd: asking myself the same question (just did a complete reinstall)
[03:54] <viciousbebop> to run it from cd but not install
[03:54] <visik7> anyone has a realtek 8168 ethernet pciexpress  card ?
[03:55] <dwa> dcypherd, it has a new gnome, new x. Not a lot of fancy new features though.
[03:55] <brynk_> dcypherd, Cashel: try reading the release notes and the changelog
[03:55] <nmbooker> penguin42: thanks.  I'll install it and see how I go.
[03:55] <dwa> But still worth upgrading
[03:55] <landmark> Hello, when i try to boot new ubuntu 6.10 from disc, see what happen: http://img289.imageshack.us/my.php?image=erroryn4.gif , im using laptop toshiba video: intel 945GM , screen: 17" 1440x900 is there any boot option to skip/fix that? thanks.
[03:55] <Cashel> so far the only difference I've noticed is that the console is now low resolution but the strange (locale or ncurses?) problems I had disapeared...
[03:56] <NET||abuse> hey guys,, what's a decent bittorrent client
[03:56] <dcypherd> Cashel: and dwa: i'm in australia with slow internet and am trying to justify the dl
[03:56] <dcypherd> haha
[03:56] <Cashel> heh
[03:56] <viciousbebop> is it start or install ubuntu
[03:56] <NET||abuse> i want to download a few distro cd images
[03:56] <viciousbebop> to run it from cd but not install
[03:56] <NET||abuse> they all seem to be available from torrents these days
[03:56] <vilefridge> NET||abuse: BitTornado
[03:56] <dwa> viciousbebop, if you insert the cd it doesn't install ubuntu
[03:56] <XiXaQ> What does this mean? $prefix/sbin/hulamanager  I can't run that command, can I?
[03:56] <Cashel> slow or caped dl? slow: do it overnight, what the heck.... dl cap: not worth it :)
[03:56] <NET||abuse> vilefridge: can i get htat in debbs?
[03:56] <dwa> it will boot first and if you want you can install it later
[03:57] <SwoOp> hi
[03:57] <ronin2> if you look for "slow dns resolution in linux" across the web, you find a bunch of stuff that tells you to disable ipv6, but even doing that does not make it even CLOSE to doing dns lookups at anywhere NEAR the speed that winxp does.
[03:57] <SwoOp> i am trying to install but X do not load ...
[03:57] <viciousbebop> so just wait for 25 sec to run out
[03:57] <ronin2> anyone know the real answer to fixing that?
[03:57] <SwoOp> edgy eft
[03:57] <brynk_> NET||abuse: azureus works for me
[03:57] <NET||abuse> vilefridge: yeh, i see it there now
[03:57] <vilefridge> NET||abuse: sure can, infact it should have been included from 6.06 on..
[03:57] <ronin2> seems to be caused by linux trying to "do the right thing"
[03:57] <SwoOp> i am trying to install edgy eft but X do not load in the livecd ...
=== SportChick is now known as essy
=== essy is now known as SportChick
[03:57] <Cashel> ronin2: by any chance is your routers IP listed in /etc/resolv.conf? try removing it...
[03:57] <penguin42> SwoOp: What graphics card do you have?
[03:58] <ronin2> Cashel: nope
[03:58] <vilefridge> SwoOp: Does it go to message telling you the monitor is out of sync?
[03:58] <SwoOp> radeon 9600
[03:58] <SwoOp> no
[03:58] <SwoOp> yes
[03:58] <SwoOp> yes
[03:58] <Cashel> ahh ok nvm... hapens with some dhcp client / router combos...
[03:58] <penguin42> maybe?
[03:58] <vilefridge> SwoOp: :)
[03:58] <ronin2> I know
[03:58] <vilefridge> SwoOp: just wait...  X will load
[03:58] <nmbooker> hoorah, solved!  thanks penguin42
[03:58] <SwoOp> but oh
[03:58] <ronin2> it's not just ubuntu - all linux gives me this problem
[03:58] <ronin2> multiple networks (home and corporate)
[03:58] <penguin42> nmbooker: No prob - I just want to know how you managed to not get it installed
[03:58] <ronin2> never understood speed difference
[03:58] <SwoOp> booting in safe graphics
[03:59] <SwoOp> X does not start
[03:59] <vilefridge> SwoOp: I had the same prob.  Mine went to that msg.. no display...    Wait 5 mins, go make coffee and spread something on a bagel.  Come back, and you'll be presented with what you want to see :)
[03:59] <ronin2> seems like its a common problem/annoyance too
[03:59] <Cashel> hmm never noticed a difference on my system.. if anything its faster in linux for me...
[03:59] <SwoOp> 5 minutes
[03:59] <SwoOp> XD
[03:59] <Carlos_> hi it seems that somebody (with bad intentions) tried to overwrite my dapper install and i need to recover it (i have the amd 64 DVD hand)
[03:59] <SwoOp> ok
[03:59] <SwoOp> thx all
[03:59] <penguin42> ronin2: One way to speed things up can be to run a local dns server for yourself and send all requests through that so it caches stuff
[03:59] <Dr_willis> Cashel,  i agree there.. Linux dns lookup/web surfing is much faster fro me.
[03:59] <ronin2> Penguin: already doing that :)
[04:00] <SwoOp> ok i will try
[04:00] <ronin2> penguin42: already doing that
[04:00] <SwoOp> bye
[04:00] <vilefridge> good luck
[04:00] <vilefridge> Hello.  I'm ready to install Edgy, but dmraid doesn't seem to map my RAID0 volume.  I found this thread: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/dmraid/+bug/54246       All I can do is wait until this is fixed?  When the bug is fixed, how will I proceed with the current build of the 6.10 disc, if it doesn't include the fix?
[04:00] <penguin42> ronin2: Have you tried a tcpdump/ethereal/wireshark to see if anything weird is going on in terms of the responses from your upstream DNS ?
[04:00] <ronin2> Cashel: Dr_willis: too much cooberation and reporting of this problem out there on the web for it to be just my issue...
[04:01] <nmbooker> penguin42: Just did an install from beta CD.  I know I didn't remove it manually.  I'll check appropriate metapackages and check it's in there as a dep.
[04:01] <Cashel> ronin2: youd be suprised
[04:01] <ronin2> Cashel: what do you mean?
[04:01] <gouki> I found OpenDNS to be much faster than my ISP DNS server. It's more 'clean' than running a local DNS server
[04:01] <ronin2> Cashel: http://www.google.com/search?q=slow+dns+resolution+in+linux&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[04:01] <Cashel> ronin2: a goodly number of morons run linux these days :)
[04:02] <visik7> anyone has a realtek 8168 ethernet pciexpress  card ?
[04:02] <Carlos_> Hello, does someone knows how to repair a fake start-stop error when starting
[04:02] <ronin2> Cashel: i'm hoping that it's something I'm missing and can fix
[04:02] <ronin2> Cashel: that's why I'm asking about it
[04:03] <ronin2> Cashel: however, on the same computer(s), on the same network(s), winxp is MUCH MUCH MUCH faster...
[04:03] <Cashel> hmmm and you did disable ipv6?
[04:03] <ronin2> Cashel: that's why I am asking how to fix the problem, or break linux's "trying to do the right thing" so it performs as quickly as windows (dns resolution)
[04:04] <ronin2> ipv6 is disabled system-wide and in firefox
[04:04] <Cashel> whats your /etc/resolv.conf look like?
[04:04] <Dr_willis> How do you even 'time' dns resolution speeds?
[04:04] <ronin2> dig google.com and look at response time
[04:04] <bbrazil> Dr_willis: dig gives that data
[04:05] <ronin2> Cashel: nameserver 12.127.16.67
[04:05] <Dr_willis> and here i was thinking 'dig' was some web site. :)
[04:05] <Cashel> Dr_willis: tracepath will work too
[04:05] <Cashel> ronin2: just the one?
[04:06] <nmbooker> penguin42: beats me.  Oh well fixed for now.  Maybe some distant dependant of it isn't or wasn't installed as part of the base install.  I'm sure it's fixed for the final CD anyway...
[04:06] <ronin2> Cashel: I can add 12.127.16.68, 12.127.17.71, 12.127.17.72....
[04:06] <Cashel> ronin2: these are your isp's dns servers not your own right?
[04:07] <Dr_willis> hmm.. opendns gives me 47ms,, my isps dns servers give me 15 ms.
[04:07] <Dr_willis> :)
[04:07] <ronin2> Cashel: yup
[04:08] <samu2> What exactly can I do in this rescue mode from the ubuntu alternate install CD?
[04:08] <Carlos_> hi does someone knows how to fix a fake start-stop error during boot
[04:08] <Cashel> ronin2: so what does dig www.google.com say for querry time?
[04:08] <N6REJ> Good morning everyone... I'm trying to make a couple of decisions. The first is Gnome VS KDE. Yes I know this is likely to start a flame war, but my thoughts are this.. . I like how in Konqueror you can easily see how your website will look in other browsers. But I understand that KDE really wants 1G of ram for its desktop. I have that but that seems excessive to me. I like the Gnome package...
[04:08] <N6REJ> ...installer (synaptic?) better then KDE's. I have'nt fairly evaluated eithers office suite so I can't comment there but that is something that would be important to me. Then there is the hardware issue. I have a Semperon 2800 64bit. I'm thinking seriously of installing the 64bit Kubuntu. BUT.... There are one or two business apps that are windows based that I would likely need to run and...
[04:08] <N6REJ> ...they are NOT 64bit. I'd appreciate any thoughts on this.
[04:08] <samu2> Is it possible to reinstall the system but like keep the user settings, home dirs and such?
[04:09] <ronin2> Cashel: 85msec
[04:09] <Cashel> woa that is slow
[04:09] <Dr_willis> samu2,  'best' wayt to do that is to keep /home on its own partition/drive
[04:09] <penguin42> N6REJ: You don't need to choose between KDE & Gnome - you can run apps written for either under the other - so mix & match
[04:09] <Cashel> double mine
[04:09] <Cashel> read this? http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-31408.html
[04:09] <Xaice> if i switch from x to terminal via ctrl+alt+f1 etc. i only see a blank screen
[04:10] <Feldegast> *ubuntu64 runs 32bit apps
[04:10] <tiger_> I use KDE + GNOME
[04:10] <jorunn> hellow
[04:10] <Whistle> helo
[04:10] <thee3> i deleted something i downloaded from azureus interface and now i want it back. is it possible?
[04:11] <teledyn> N6REJ: you can run gnome and still use konqueror, or run KDE and use stuff like evolution and nautilus
[04:11] <N6REJ> penguin42: ok... next q... I will likley need to have java sdk 1.4.2 because I'm thinking of running "opentaps"
[04:11] <jorunn> got problem whit network, somethimes i see the led of "wifi" on my laptop pulse and at that moment ubuntu is slowin down...
[04:11] <jorunn> very weird
[04:12] <N6REJ> I seem to remember something about one or the other taking considerably more resources.
[04:12] <teledyn> N6REJ: for your business apps you can run wine, or pay for the commercial version called crossover office which has some better features
[04:12] <penguin42> N6REJ: I don't know Java stuff - maybe someone else here can help
[04:13] <N6REJ> ok, so what do we use as the "guide" to help decide which desktop to install?
[04:14] <Feldegast> N6REJ u could get ubuntu and kubuntu cd's and try both....
[04:14] <N6REJ> Other then the menuing systems and installed software I don't see a difference.
[04:15] <dusk> !pypanel
[04:15] <ubotu> pypanel: lightweight panel/taskbar for X11 window managers. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.4-1.1 (edgy), package size 13 kB, installed size 96 kB
[04:15] <dusk> is pypanel broken in edgy?
[04:15] <mrbond82> N6REJ- I think the debate over which desktop to use is pretty lame. You just got to pick one that you like and you can get used to. I find that Gnome is the most like Mac OS and KDE feels a bit more like windowsxp
[04:17] <N6REJ> AH, ok, well that explains a little bit.  I was more concerned with the underlying "engine" then with the looks per se'  I realize you can change how it looks.  Ok, well I'll have to give this some thought.
[04:17] <POVaddct> BenC: hi, are you the ohci1394 author?
[04:17] <Tatey> Hey, I'm experiencing issues creating a software RAID 5 configuration. When I attempt to create the inital array with the node /dev/md0 it outputs "Error opening /dev/md0: No such file or directory"
[04:17] <Tatey> anyone able to offer any suggestions?
[04:17] <N6REJ> Does anyone know if its possible to still get the Sun Java 1.4.2 sdk?
[04:17] <BenC> POVaddct: author, no; maintainer, yes
[04:17] <Cashel> Tatey: create the node?
[04:17] <POVaddct> BenC: ah okay. nice work!
[04:17] <BenC> POVaddct: thx
[04:18] <ronin2> Cashel: that fedora post is cool.  never thought to do that. however, it's weird.  The nameservers that come up, 12.127.16.69 and 199.191.128.105, are FAST using "dig @199.191.128.105 google.com", BUT, when I make those my nameservers in resolv.conf, dns resolution fails in firefox...
[04:18] <samu2> What is this OEM mode?
[04:18] <ronin2> Cashel: why would they work for the dig command and not for firefox?
[04:18] <POVaddct> BenC: just made a backup to my external firewire drive :)
[04:18] <MetaMorfoziS> how can i identfy what driver used by my xorg?
[04:18] <Nutubuntu> I'm trying to troubleshoot a Dapper issue in which trying to play a video sometimes throws me back to the ubuntu login screen. In /etc/log/messages I see that gconfd received signal 15 and shut down. Is that significant? Where should I look now to troubleshoot this?
[04:18] <Tatey> I'm running "$ sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --chunk=64 --level=raid5 --raid-devices=4 /dev/X /dev/X /dev/X /dev/X"
[04:18] <jorunn> OEM version is for when you got a laptop or pc bought with ubuntu on it,
[04:18] <Ropechoborra> !edgy
[04:18] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[04:19] <jorunn> and than you can reinstall youre oem version
[04:19] <samu2> jorunn ok, thanks
[04:19] <Cashel> ronin2: your dig'ing them not trying to resolve using them.... are they listed as authoritive or non authoritive?
[04:19] <catalytic> whats a good hyperterminal replacement?
[04:19] <kurcaci> Hello! I want to remove a package: how to remove the automatically dependencies too?
[04:19] <catalytic> i need serial access to a cisco
[04:19] <N6REJ> one last question if you will... ext3 or ReiserFS or??
[04:19] <Tatey> I'm absolutely stumped at why it won't create /dev/md0
[04:19] <Tatey> N6REJ: I tend to use ReiserFS over Ext3
[04:19] <penguin42> catalytic: minicom
[04:19] <catalytic> chhers
[04:19] <catalytic> cheers
[04:19] <POVaddct> catalytic: minicom and screen
[04:20] <N6REJ> Tatey: that was my thought too
[04:20] <POVaddct> catalytic: though screen is not exactly a terminal program
[04:20] <samu2> I was able to access my home dir on the partition that I can'
[04:20] <Cashel> N6REJ: ext3 is more flexible, reiserfs has some features some folks like...
[04:20] <MetaMorfoziS> how can i identfy what driver used by my xorg?
[04:20] <Tatey> ReiserFS is faster ;)
[04:20] <penguin42> N6REJ: For large filesystems (>500G) I tend to go for reiser, for smaller ones I go for ext3
[04:20] <jon273> apt-get upgrade:
[04:20] <Cashel> Tatey: ummm that depends, faster doing what?
[04:20] <jon273> The following packages have been kept back: gtk2-engines-ubuntulooks libggi2 mplayer
[04:20] <Tatey> anyhow, anyone able to offer any light on my software raid configuration?
[04:20] <samu2> t boot from any more through a shell in rescue mode, but how would I be able to backup files from here?
[04:20] <jon273> how would that be?
[04:20] <N6REJ> I just need a journaling system because if the power suddenly goes out I need it to be able to fix itself.
[04:20] <jon273> *why
[04:20] <penguin42> Tatey: sorry, what was the problem with it?
[04:20] <kurcaci> In other words: is there something similar to Gentoos: emerge --depclean ?
[04:21] <Cashel> theres a good website about this... (fires up firefox)
[04:21] <samu2> Can I send them to a shared dir on my winXP PC somehow?
[04:21] <Tatey> I'm experiencing issues creating a software RAID 5 configuration. When I attempt to create the inital array with the node /dev/md0 it outputs "Error opening /dev/md0: No such file or directory"
[04:21] <penguin42> Tatey: Can you do an ls -l /dev/md0 - I suspect you'll find it doesn't exist (Hmm what is the right answer to this with udev?)
[04:22] <jon273> Why would apt-get just not upgrade certain packages? Can I found out why?
[04:22] <Tatey> penguin42: yes, it doesn't exist. I'm not sure why they aren't being created. I suspect I'm missing the appropriate package
[04:23] <Tatey> I've done a "text-based install system"
[04:23] <penguin42> Tatey: No, I think its just because of the magic udev stuff - I'm not sure what the correct answer is ; but you shoul be able to cd into /dev and do ./MAKEDEV md
[04:24] <Tatey> penguin42: I'll give it a shot
[04:24] <penguin42> I'd be interested if there was a udev guru that could tell me the right way
[04:24] <Tatey> I just don't want to restart my system one day and find that node missing
[04:24] <catalytic> which ones are your serial port in /dev?
[04:24] <penguin42> catalytic: /dev/ttyS0 and ttyS1 typically
[04:25] <Cashel> Tatey: find its major and minor nums so you can recreate by hand...
[04:25] <POVaddct> catalytic: /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1 (for com1: and com2:)
[04:25] <penguin42> catalytic: for USB its simular but with a USB in the name somewhere
[04:25] <POVaddct> catalytic: usb serial is /dev/ttyUSB0
[04:25] <xamox> what is the SSHD package called?
[04:25] <POVaddct> xamox: openssh-server
[04:26] <Nutubuntu> I'm trying to troubleshoot a Dapper issue in which trying to play a video sometimes throws me back to the ubuntu login screen. In /etc/log/messages I see that gconfd received signal 15 and shut down. Is that significant? Where should I look now to troubleshoot this?
[04:26] <xamox> POVaddct:  alright, thx
[04:26] <penguin42> Tatey: The way it's supposed to work is that the devices get automagically created by the system at boot; you'll find /dev isn't a real disk backed directory
[04:26] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: Try checking /var/log/Xorg.0.log and .xsession-errors as well
[04:26] <samu2> What is "and use LVM" for partitioning disks?
[04:27] <penguin42> samu2: Linux Volume Manager
[04:27] <ronin2> Cashel: they are their own non-authoritative servers...
[04:27] <NetVamp> Hi, I finally got my Ubuntu 6.06 up and running and now I would like to set in in some corner and be able to control it remotely, ssh should be working fine (didn't try yet) but I'm also looking for a solution not only to control it by shell but also by some kind of remote desktop connection, like WinXP has
[04:27] <POVaddct> penguin42: logical volume manager
[04:27] <penguin42> samu2: Its a newer funkier way of partitioning discs than the old DOS partitioning system
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> is there an easy way to move files from an actual desktop, to the desktop of an operatingsystem on a vmware virtual machine?
[04:27] <penguin42> POVaddct: Oops - apologies
[04:27] <NetVamp> I know there is something like the Free Linux NX Server, but are there better solutions for it?
[04:27] <Tatey> <3 LVM
[04:27] <nolimitsoya> (xubuntu, both os)
[04:27] <samu2> penguin42 ah thanks
[04:27] <POVaddct> penguin42: no problem :)
[04:27] <techNiKal> hi i want to capture packets coming to my linux box from all the client machine, my machine is acting as a way to share internet, can i check which machine is bombarding packets i tried ethereal but it is an analyzer rather then a meter to show me the traffic is coming from which machine
[04:27] <penguin42> techNiKal: iptraf is a good meter type thing

[04:28] <Cashel> ronin2: instead of under resolv.conf, have you tried doing what that page said?
[04:28] <Kannix> Does anyone know if there is a spamfilter included in Evolution with edgy? Or do you have to install spamassassin and/or bogofilter to make it work?
[04:28] <penguin42> samu2: lvm is kind of powerful, but it can be a pain if you've only got a simple setup
[04:28] <Cashel> ronin2: never tried that myself, but maybe it does it differently (?!?)
[04:28] <NetVamp> @Ljl perfekt, dont know how I good have forgotten that one, thx
[04:28] <NetVamp> -good +could
[04:29] <samu2> hmm, but I'm still wondering if I can transfer files to my winXP PC or a usb stick when I open a shell on the filesystem with the messed up ubuntu
[04:29] <dcraven> !vnc > dcraven
[04:29] <noela> hi
[04:29] <nolimitsoya> samu2, mount the usb stick, and use mv
[04:30] <LjL> NetVamp: for that matter, i think you already have a VNC client and server (not sure how they're called, i'm in KDE) in you Applications menu -- although the server is probably set up to work in an invite-only way, i.e. someone has to be logged into the desktop and issue an invite to somebody else. ubotu's link on the other hand tells you how to get a proper standalon VNC server running

[04:38] <Vladaz> when I write glxinfo |grep direct
[04:38] <Vladaz> is it ok?
[04:39] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: Nah - its the signal 11 - that's a segfault
[04:39] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: That's a bug in the xserver or the video card driver, or a hardware problem - if it only occurs doing that then its probably not the hardware
[04:39] <Vladaz> anyone?
[04:39] <Cashel> ronin2: it tells it what domains to begin searching with... I take it your not using dhcp? pppoe?
[04:39] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: Which graphics card and driver have you got?
[04:40] <samu2> Ok, so how would I try mounting my USB stick when running a shell in the filesys?

[04:41] <penguin42> samu2: Plug the stick in, then look cat  /proc/partitions   you should find a new device has appeared - e.g. sda1 or sda4 (might have a different name if your sata disc already has that name)
[04:42] <Cashel> ronin2: or maybe your running a local dhcp server for your private network?
[04:42] <ronin2> Cashel: local
[04:42] <samu2> penguin42: proc is empty
[04:42] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: Hey it's ok; pop open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for the    Section "Device" and there will be a Driver line
[04:43] <Cashel> (which would be odd unless your private network is a school or something)
[04:43] <POVaddct> samu2: then mount it: mount -t proc none /proc

[04:45] <Cashel> Maggotin: go into synaptic and look for the latest linux-image that matches your architecture
[04:45] <penguin42> Nutubuntu: same as me (I've got a Radeon 7000) - so you could try using the vesa driver that should work, perhaps not as fast but it would be interesting to see if you have similar problems

[04:47] <ronin2> Cashel: just like that debian admin post writer
[04:48] <samu2> So I dont get any sdax partitions in my proc/partitions and the USB stick doesn't start flashing when I insert it
[04:48] <samu2> I'm not seeing garbage there, but this is winXP
[04:48] <Cashel> those never come through right on my xp install....
[04:48] <POVaddct> samu2: modprobe ehci-hcd ; modprobe usb-storage
[04:49] <Cashel> wish I could read kanji
[04:49] <samu2> It ain't easy
[04:50] <Cashel> yeah I know

[04:50] <samu2> POVaddct those are separate lines?
[04:51] <hornet123> Hello, my superblock /dev/hda11 is defect, how can i correct that ?
[04:51] <POVaddct> samu2: you can write one line if you use the semicolon  ;
[04:51] <penguin42> hornet123: Tell me more - what tells you it is defective
[04:51] <ProN00b> are there any visual (gui) tools like diff ?
[04:51] <dcraven> ProN00b, meld
[04:52] <penguin42> ProN00b: Loads of them; xxdiff is a simple one
[04:52] <_array> hey guys, i'm trying to update to edgy, but there is nothing in my /etc/apt/sources.list..
[04:52] <_array> what is supposed to be there?
[04:52] <PecisDarbs> !Xorg
[04:52] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[04:52] <Cashel> spiderworm: remove them all then get the nvidia driver from the website
[04:52] <hornet123> penguin42, i tried to install edgy, formatted hda11 ext3, now boot does not work exits to console saying superblock is wrong.
[04:53] <LjL> mcphail: fyi, it appears that the correct debconf command to get questions asked is dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config   not just fontconfig
[04:53] <penguin42> hornet123: OK, was your hda11 your / or something else? What type of prompt has it left you at - what is the line before that error?
[04:53] <samu2> POVaddct yeah i figured that, just making absolutely sure. anyway, there are still only hdsomething partitions in proc/partitions
[04:53] <LjL> mcphail: (ah, wrong channel, but anyway)
[04:53] <webben> Are there no spidermonkey development packages that work for Ubuntu?
[04:53] <POVaddct> samu2: is it a usb2.0 stick?
[04:54] <mcphail> LjL: i think i did it once with a plain old dpkg-reconfigure -a
[04:54] <samu2> POVaddct it doesn't say specifically. It's 1GB though.
[04:54] <dustin> what happend to the "disk" utility?
[04:54] <POVaddct> samu2: i forgot scsi disk support: modprobe sd_mod
[04:54] <scythe128> well, other than running kernel -27 instead of 17, how can I be sure that my dist-upgrade worked?
[04:55] <hornet123> no hda11 is not /, penguin42, i think it left me in a normal prompt, but i don't know.
[04:55] <LjL> mcphail: it does ask about autohinting, but i find it a bit cryptic. it gives a choice of "Native", "Autohinter" and "None", the default being Native - the explanation says "Native" is suggested if you use mainly Bitstream Vera or Microsoft Fonts, "Autohinter" for most other TrueType fonts. I'm giving Autohinter a try (guess i'll have to restart X), though i'll have to find out what these actually mean
[04:55] <POVaddct> samu2: those modules are normally loaded automatically by udev, but in this rescue situation you have to load them yourself
[04:56] <spiderworm> Cashel: are there known problems with the ubuntu nvidia packages or something?
[04:56] <dcraven> scythe128, System/About GNOME... If it says version 2.16, your golden.
[04:56] <sipher> jezzzz.
[04:56] <sipher> that edgy upgrade is B R O K E N.
[04:56] <scythe128> ohhh, uhhh.. brb, not in gnome at the moment
[04:56] <scythe128> sipher, how is it broken?
[04:56] <samu2> POVaddct still only hdxx partitions in proc/partitions
[04:56] <spiderworm> Cashel: i get that that should work, but if the edgy packages are supposed to work, i'd rather stick that route
[04:57] <H0110Wman> P
[04:57] <Cashel> spiderworm: not that I know of, but apparently you have glx libs and kernel module mismatched, and since I dont exactly where those are, but I do know the nvidia installer checks all of that for you, that that'll fix your problem...
[04:57] <POVaddct> samu2: modprobe ohci-hcd ; modprobe uhci-hcd   (that's for usb1.x support)
[04:57] <sipher> scythe128 videi problems...no smp... most of my kde apps don't more anymore...amsn i fucked... everything is whacked. beryl uses 100% at time now...unstable.
[04:57] <penguin42> hornet123: OK if it wasn't your / then that should make life easier - do an fdisk -l    and check that the partitions look about right
[04:57] <sipher> 100% cpu
[04:58] <sipher> omg that was terribly typed =/
[04:58] <Cashel> spiderworm: normaly thats a good idea, with the nvidia drivers I make an exception.. (and with mplayer, since I want my movies to play and I run 64 bit :) )
[04:58] <sipher> mismatched gcc / kernel version...
[04:58] <sipher> d0h
[04:58] <samu2> POVaddct should it just appear in proc/partitions when the right modules are loaded, or does it matter if it is already inserted when a relevant module is loaded so that I have to go and unplug and plug it in again?
[04:58] <sipher> if someone needs to recompile drivers...
[04:58] <sipher> ie network drivers..
[04:58] <sipher> F u c & e d
[04:59] <POVaddct> samu2: try unplug/plug
[04:59] <nashnash> for ppl who have a scanner: someone knows why when i try to scan (xsane,kooka) it scans it with colour (especially blue background) even though the page is white, plz help , thanks!
[04:59] <sipher> No doubt nvidia problems....
[04:59] <sipher> #1) I installed nvidia drivers.
[04:59] <scythe128> nope, gnome is still 2.14.x
[04:59] <scythe128> grr
[04:59] <sipher> #2) They didn't modify the xorg config after the install
[05:00] <samu2> POVaddct hmm still nothing

[05:00] <sipher> which takes just as long to boot.
[05:00] <Cashel> fancy?

[05:01] <Cashel> well I'm off to see the wizard
[05:02] <sipher> segfault_ do all your qt based apps work?
[05:02] <scythe128> could you be a little more specific sipher, my did an apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade and everything is working fine!  I dont think it took though
[05:02] <sipher> seems like most of the kde apps are fried.
[05:02] <penguin42> hornet123: Hmm, looks sane
[05:02] <Supremacygnu> hey. I tried to upgrade to Egdy today and it didn't work and now I got a corrupted file system. So what I want to do now is to copy my files to my moveable disc. The problem is that I don't have permission to copy the files.
[05:02] <segfault_> sipher, yes everything works
[05:02] <sipher> scythe128 thats not an upgrade.
[05:02] <segfault_> !upgrade | scythe128

[05:03] <sipher> scythe128 you are still running ubuntu 6.06, dapper.
[05:03] <segfault_> scythe128, read that and see what u missed
[05:03] <penguin42> hornet123: so if you do    mount /dev/hda11 /mnt  (assuming you have a spare /mnt) what do you see?
[05:03] <UKMatt> hey all, I have a .avi that I filmed on my camera sideways and I need to rotate it, what software can I do that with
[05:03] <sipher> segfault_ what hardware are you running on?
[05:03] <samu2> POVaddct i found a 5.10 CD but that didnt have liveCD functionality yet or?
[05:03] <dcraven> sipher, did you run dist-upgrade twice?
[05:03] <kristian> hi! I got problems with my ati card. When I have done the BinaryDriverHowto/ATI, the Mesa driver still works
[05:03] <sipher> dcraven several times.
[05:03] <sipher> dcraven it still doesn't help the fact my video is screwed big time.
[05:03] <segfault_> sipher, laptop intel core duo, nvidia graphics
[05:03] <POVaddct> samu2: 5.10 had two separate cds. one live cd and one installer.
[05:03] <dcraven> err.. scythe128 I meant :(
[05:04] <sipher> segfault_ dual core working?
[05:04] <kristian> when i try this command, sudo modprobe fglrx, this came:Fatal: Modul fglrx not found
[05:04] <sipher> segfault_ did you install nvidia's drivers?
[05:04] <dcraven> scythe128, did you run dist-upgrade twice?
[05:04] <samu2> POVaddct ah i suspect this one is installer then
[05:04] <sipher> segfault_ are you running anything in the unsupported repos?
[05:04] <UKMatt> video editing for .avi software anyone?  any ideas?
[05:04] <dxdemetriou> Is it safe to use "sudo touch /forcefsck" for force fsck the root? I used to use the "shutdown -F.." but don't work on edgy
[05:04] <segfault_> sipher, unsupported as in universe/multiverse?
[05:04] <sipher> as in...
[05:04] <samu2> POVaddct Can I mount the hda1 ntfs filesys in writable mode and copy files?
[05:04] <sipher> add remove programs
[05:04] <sipher> check unsupported.
[05:05] <POVaddct> samu2: no, ntfs cannot be written safely from linux
[05:05] <dcraven> penguin42, yes there is.
[05:05] <scythe128> thanx for the link
[05:05] <sipher> POVaddct yes it can.
[05:05] <penguin42> UKMatt: There seems to be a thing called kino  according to apt-cache search; I don't know what it's like
[05:05] <penguin42> dcraven: Any idea of the name?
[05:05] <scythe128> time to go break some stuff :)
[05:05] <POVaddct> sipher: you risk its integrity
[05:05] <samu2> POVaddct hehe, it doesn't matter where I turn it seems
[05:05] <dcraven> penguin42, ls /etc/alternatives/ | grep browser
[05:05] <sipher> samu2 with later releases of 2.6 writting to ntfs filesystems works fine.
[05:05] <UKMatt> penguin42, yeah I have kino, I can't open the .avi in it because it gives me some "DV" error
[05:05] <segfault_> sipher, i dont use synaptic i use cmd line for all pkg managemenrt, but yes im running plenty from universe/multi plus beryl/emerald plus beta nvidia driver
[05:06] <Supremacygnu> hey. I tried to upgrade to Egdy today and it didn't work and now I got a corrupted file system. So what I want to do now is to copy my files to my moveable disc. The problem is that I don't have permission to copy the files.
[05:06] <sipher> POVaddct if you are running 2.4 kernel or..old 2.6
[05:06] <kristian> hi! I got problems with my ati card. When I have done the BinaryDriverHowto/ATI, the Mesa driver still works.. when i try this command, sudo modprobe fglrx, this came:Fatal: Modul fglrx not found
[05:06] <sipher> segfault_ as do I...
[05:06] <POVaddct> sipher: which 2.6 release would that be?

[05:06] <hornet123> penguin, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29548/
[05:06] <sipher> POVaddct not 100% sure...but that issue was resolved.
[05:06] <segfault_> sipher, beryl working quite well here
[05:06] <POVaddct> sipher: okay. good to know.
[05:07] <samu2> I'm a bit hesitant to do it if it riskt the integrity
[05:07] <sipher> jake chances are you need a java run time environement.
[05:07] <sipher> segfault_ mine boost cpu to 100% at times.
[05:07] <sipher> segfault_ also...what video drivers are you using?
[05:07] <samu2> POVaddct what approach could have worked if i could boot a liveCD with net access?
[05:07] <POVaddct> samu2: do you mind downloading a 30mb live cd?
[05:07] <jake> got em from automatix java web pages work fine
[05:08] <sipher> jake whats the error?
[05:08] <LjL> !automatix
[05:08] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:08] <POVaddct> samu2: i have a stripped down version of damn small linux (vDSL) that might solve the problem
[05:08] <segfault_> sipher, im using beta nvidia drivers and not using xgl
[05:08] <Supremacygnu> jake: try frostwire
[05:08] <sipher> segfault_ same here.
[05:08] <kristian> hi! I got problems with my ati card. When I have done the BinaryDriverHowto/ATI, the Mesa driver still works.. when i try this command, sudo modprobe fglrx, this came:Fatal: Modul fglrx not found
[05:08] <jake> runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[05:08] <sipher> mines FRIED.
[05:08] <segfault_> sipher, beryl 1.1 seemed to increase cpu usage quite a bit
[05:08] <dxdemetriou> can anybody tell me what is the correct command for force check in boot?
[05:08] <segfault_> !nvidiabeta | sipher
[05:08] <ubotu> sipher: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) Beta version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[05:08] <samu2> POVaddct can I set up a shared folder on my other winXP PC and send files to it through samba then or something?
[05:09] <sipher> segfault_ it seems it always tries to load the open source drivers..

[05:12] <eracc> To clarify: How does one determine under *buntu with apt* which UNINSTALLED package provides a specific file? It appears that apt-cache only tells one about installed packages.

[05:17] <sipher> Heh but thats crashed.
[05:17] <sipher> so it seems.
[05:17] <jrib> CarinArr: expand on "doesn't do anything", does it give you output?
[05:17] <segfault_> sipher, learn apt-get and be happy :)
[05:17] <nilo> I make it, but only show me home and media

[05:18] <sipher> heh
[05:18] <sipher> if you can code...
[05:18] <penguin42> (Does anyone know what the Ubuntu recommended way of making the generic one the default is?)
[05:18] <collin> penguin42: when i choose the generic one, it don't recognize my wireless card anymore
[05:19] <CarinArr> jrib, i thought i had already
[05:19] <sipher> and I think I know whats up...
[05:19] <jrib> CarinArr: k, did you grab w32codecs as well?
[05:19] <sipher> its trying to replace a module thats loaded.
[05:19] <penguin42> collin: You want two cores AND a wireless card? Sheesh people will never be satisfied....
[05:19] <penguin42> collin: Did you have to install some firmware for the wireless card or did it do that by itself?
[05:19] <segfault_> collin, u need to install the restricted modules pkg also for the generic one
[05:19] <collin> penguin42: it installed by itself
[05:20] <CarinArr> jrib, no i didn't actually.. i seemed to remember it being available in synaptic but couldnt' find it in edgy
[05:20] <der0b> hey folks, is there an explanation as to what/why the devices are called UUID=95180220-1c40-466b-8415-8e21129d1e60 in edgy fstab now?  Can it be changed back to /dev/sdax if I want?  any docs?
[05:20] <segfault_> sipher, i can code not sure oday is tho
[05:20] <jrib> !w32codecs > CarinArr
[05:20] <sipher> Heh
[05:20] <jrib> CarinArr: nope, you have to download the deb
[05:20] <sipher> You know what a segfault is?
[05:20] <penguin42> collin: OK, I don't know wireless foo - my guess is its installed something but only installed it for the i386 kernel - you might be able to get it to do it for the generic
[05:20] <timhaughton> Help! :) Sudo appears to have stopped working. sudo -i silently fails. sudo somecommand doesn't work anymore.

[05:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about segfault - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:21] <penguin42> der0b: I think it's so if the device names change - e.g. by plugging USB devices in a different order then they still mount in the right place
[05:21] <segfault_> sipher, yea
[05:21] <der0b> timhaughton: are other programs failing as well?  firefox etc?
[05:21] <phipps> are there any known problems concerning java-gnome and edgy eft ?
[05:21] <collin> penguin42: should i notice a difference with the generic one, i mean is it worth it?
[05:21] <timhaughton> der0b: I'm talking to an Edgy server via ssh.
[05:21] <sipher> in some cases memory violations of the sort...can be exploited into doing mystical things.
[05:21] <penguin42> collin: generic will get you both processors
[05:21] <CarinArr> okay, thanks jrib
[05:21] <sipher> ie... code execution as root.
[05:21] <Supremacygnu> I want to copy files from my corrupted filesystem to my moveable disc. But I don't have permission to do so... how do I do it? chmod does not seem work
[05:21] <der0b> ahhh, that's interesting penguin42, any documenation?
[05:21] <segfault_> collin, it supports dual cores
[05:22] <der0b> timhaughton: have you changed the hostname of the machine recently?
[05:22] <sipher> collin install the generic kernel.
[05:22] <jrib> nilo: your problem is strange :)  don't know how to troubleshoot.  Does it persist after reboot?
[05:22] <sipher> I was told it is suppose to be default.
[05:22] <sipher> mine isn't.
[05:22] <penguin42> der0b: I don't know of any - I don't like UUID to be honest; I prefer redhat's way of using Labels - but it also has issues
[05:22] <sipher> nor does the kernel work ...eriod.
[05:22] <sipher> period.
[05:22] <collin> segfault_: what are the restricted modules that you mentioned to get my wireless working
[05:22] <timhaughton> der0b: No. I was just trying to change the permissions on my Subversion database. And poof! sudo appears to be silently failing.
[05:23] <nilo> yes i reboot my system twice
[05:23] <kristian> dcraven, can you help?
[05:23] <thandavarayan> problem, after installing beryl and emerald that I do not get any gnome themes working...
[05:23] <jrib> nilo: have you tried a new user to see if it happens there?
[05:23] <der0b> sorry timhaughton, I'm out of ideas..
[05:23] <nilo> no, i will try
[05:23] <segfault_> collin, what wireless card u have ipw3945, u need to install linux-restricted-modules pkg for ur kernel
[05:24] <timhaughton> der0b: Thanks for the help :) I'd reboot it, but it's about 105 miles away, and I can't even reboot with sudo :(
[05:24] <segfault_> collin, sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
[05:24] <dcraven> kristian, I don't use that driver. I just took a guess :(
[05:24] <penguin42> segfault_/collin: Ah so probably need to install linux-restricted-modules-generic
[05:24] <Slike> thandavarayan: check your startup programs, are beryl and emerald listed?
[05:24] <Supremacygnu> I want to copy files from my corrupted filesystem to my moveable disc. But I don't have permission to do so... how do I do it? chmod does not seem work. Sorry for the spam. But I really need help with this
[05:25] <samu2> POVaddct I ended up trashing all the files and just doing a clean install now, thanks for trying to help though.
[05:25] <segfault_> penguin42, exactly
[05:25] <kristian> dcraven, ok... I got this problem for 3-4 months ago, and i can't make the driver work :S.. hate it :P
[05:25] <thandavarayan> Slike: I meant, not beryl and emerald....but clearlooks and human theme...
[05:26] <thandavarayan> Slike: now I have plain theme....
[05:26] <Slike> thandavarayan: it looks old and ugly?
[05:26] <timhaughton> der0b: Do you know if the su command should work? It isn't accepting my password. I'm starting to worry my server might have been comprimised :/
[05:27] <thandavarayan> Slike: yeah...now can I get the themes now.
[05:27] <POVaddct> samu2: just curious, what damaged your system in the first place?
[05:27] <b1shop> trying to update to 6.1 via apt-get dist-upgrade.  says 0 packages avail?
[05:27] <Slike> thandavarayan: got this problem too, because beryl doesn't start at startup, you should try to start a default gnome session with the metacity windowmanager
[05:28] <Supremacygnu> how do I change my filesystem from read-only so I can copy files to my moveable disc?
[05:28] <collin> segfault_: i'm not using the generic kernel right now, because then i wouldn't have the internet, does it matter if i install the generic restricted modules with the kernel i'm running and then restart?
[05:28] <b1shop> if i try to update with gksu "update-manager -c" i get bzip2 errors about one of the lists
[05:28] <thandavarayan> Slike: for me beryl starts and all eye candy works...but no gnome-themes.
[05:28] <segfault_> collin, install the gerneic kernel and the generic restricted modules then reboot
[05:28] <frederick85> whats the package name for dev utilities such as GCC
[05:29] <jrib> frederick85: build-essential
[05:29] <Slike> thandavarayan: ok, that's good then :), don't know whether beryl supports these default themes, the themes you're refering to are the ones for metacity, not for beryl

[05:29] <penguin42> segfault_: Is there a reason that the 386 kernel gets installed these days and why does it end up as the default in grub even when generic is installed?
[05:29] <samu2> POVaddct it was originally installed as a 5.04 system and then dist-upgraded a few times, accumulating some small errors every time, this time when i used the upgrade-manager it stopped running halfway through and then when i quit it and restarted the PC, I couldn't start ubuntu anymore.
[05:30] <collin> segfault_: which one? linux-restricted-modules-generic or linux restricted-modules-2.6.17.10-generic
[05:30] <POVaddct> samu2: argh
[05:30] <thandavarayan> Slike: I am not worried about window manager themes...I worried about the themes which are the applications.... now I have plain gtk theme....which is grrrrr

[05:58] <SirTwist__> factotum, excecuting via console works?
[05:58] <cliffd> Supremacygnu: what about a fresh install? do you think the mess up was from updating config files?
[05:58] <factotum> in the icon properties i have the icon property set as: ~/NeverwitnerNights/nwn/nwn
[05:58] <ianmacgregor> marialt_: Please speak English in this channel
[05:58] <factotum> yes, via console it works

[06:04] <SirTwist__> ah ok, so ./nwn is a skript?

[06:06] <timhaughton> Can anyone help - my only user no longer appears to be in the sudoers file, and it's a remote server I can't easily get access to.
[06:06] <sheri_rao> Elbourne, use BIOS to find out ur RAM
[06:06] <nikosapi> elbourne: try dmesg | more near the top it say
[06:07] <dcraven> timhaughton, that sounds like trouble.
[06:07] <sipher> Yay SMP loven.
[06:07] <timhaughton> dcraven: I'm getting that feeling too.
[06:07] <teledyn> sipher: did it fix it?
[06:07] <sipher> it's has been alot of work upgrading.
[06:07] <dcraven> timhaughton, feel like going for a drive ;)?
[06:07] <sipher> teledyn I needed to reinstall the restricted modules as well...
[06:07] <sipher> and uhh
[06:07] <sipher> it seems the nvidia drivers are wacky sometimes.
[06:07] <iter> factotum: can you just export PATH=path/to/nwn && nwn
[06:07] <sipher> it sucks also...
[06:07] <sipher> cause.
[06:07] <teledyn> sipher: someone should probably report that bug
[06:08] <dcraven> timhaughton, are you the only user on that box?
[06:08] <teledyn> sipher: i have no prob with the nvidia
[06:08] <sipher> you can't reload the drivers using crtl+alt backspace.
[06:08] <Elbourne> sheri_rao OK thanks I will check the BIOS
[06:08] <SirTwist__> factotum, create a script, containing the commands and assign an icon to it
[06:08] <sipher> just just reloads X
[06:08] <iter> sipher: works for me
[06:08] <timhaughton> dcraven: There's one other remote user, but he doesn't have any admin access.
[06:08] <teledyn> sipher: if its a problem switch to the nv driver
[06:08] <sipher> iter..
[06:08] <sipher> it works.
[06:08] <sipher> but it doesn't reload the drivers.
[06:08] <factotum> SirTwist__: ha! i was just thinking that myself
[06:08] <sipher> ie. I don't see the nvidia logo
[06:08] <iter> sipher: the drivers have to match the kernel module you know
[06:08] <sipher> iter yes yes..
[06:08] <sipher> also..
[06:08] <SirTwist__> factotum, yeah, however i don't see the problem ...
[06:09] <sipher> if you are compiling...gcc + kernel versions much match.
[06:09] <iter> so reloading the driver w/o restart isn't a very good idea
[06:09] <iter> x server will just crap out
[06:09] <sipher> iter it works very well.
[06:09] <timhaughton> dcraven: You're trying to scare me :)

[06:15] <sipher> teledyn saved my ass?
[06:15] <iter> damn teledyn coppin some attitude
[06:15] <sipher> you saved me time.
[06:15] <radar1976> how can I rid of them
[06:15] <dcraven> Elbourne, it really depends on the ISP. Short answer is "No, it doesn't matter.". Long answer is that a) they don't know how to use Linux when they come to install, or b) they have spam/spyware software that they want you to use that works on Windows only.
[06:15] <theo_> vio`: so no solution?
[06:15] <sheri_rao> Elbourne, OS is independent of what u r telling , but it is possible ur hardware vendors  or whatever provide service for window users
[06:15] <radar1976> it is making my system local skyrocket!

[06:16] <dcraven> timhaughton, that's exactly what happened.
[06:16] <theo_> vio`:  Is that the "solution" to this problem?
[06:16] <timhaughton> dcraven: Bugger.
[06:16] <vio`> thats the easiest solution theo_

[06:29] <SirTwist__> theo_, ok .. good luck
[06:29] <MadCowBoy> Hi there, Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction...  My wireless card was working last night, and then this morning, no connection... actually when opening  wireless-network, it says no such device (my card is eth0) after I  reverted to an older (working) interfaces file.  I booted into windows, and could see my card, but it wasn;t connecting to my netwowrk automatically, because 'radio' was off, which I turned on (and
[06:29] <MadCowBoy> never had to do before)  so back to Ubuntu and no Joy on that front...any suggestions?
[06:29] <theo_> SirTwist__:  thnx :)
[06:29] <spiderworm> segfault_: there's nothing about "generic" that screams 686 to me... do you know why the change?
[06:29] <nMosila> SirTwist__, No, any line must include they
[06:29] <iter> MadCowBoy: lspci show your card?

[06:30] <segfault_> spiderworm, to get the support u used to get from 686 kernel install generic kernel, i do not know why they changed the name, but i can tell u that is what replaced the old 686 kernel pkg
[06:30] <NetVamp> @SirTwist it there is anything else, will Ubuntu bring some sort of error on boot up? But I guess I'll see if it works or not. Thx
[06:30] <spiderworm> thanks segfault_

[06:38] <ToHellWithGA> what is an english analog of Lorenzo?
[06:38] <cieffe> teledyn: no XFS, but with a FAT the problem is the same
[06:39] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[06:39] <cieffe> teledyn: /dev/sda1 on /media/MAXTOR type xfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)
[06:39] <teledyn> jenda-lappy: check the cups website and lookup your printer.  they may have info on it
[06:39] <ZeeO> whats the xvid package called
[06:39] <teledyn> cieffe: hmm okay its not using the slow usb driver
[06:40] <cieffe> teledyn: with dapper there isn't this problem

[06:42] <sorush20> hi how do i sort out this error please ? http://pastebin.co.uk/4920
[06:42] <teledyn> cieffe: i have no idea.  maybe its related to FAD but that's just a wild guess
[06:42] <ndlovu> if I have a line of text ("Pages:          2"), is there a command I can use to just cut the number so I can use it in a script?
[06:42] <ZeeO> ok last one can i somehow mount a windows share of videos so i can play over the network i seen how to view the network drive and have the link on the desktop but i can't say use VLC to go to that dir
[06:42] <bense> hm, this is odd, user is set to root, group is set to audio
[06:42] <teledyn> ndlovu: cut
[06:43] <SirTwist__> ZeeO, samba is the magic word
[06:43] <cieffe> teledyn: FAD? what is it?
[06:43] <woro2006> what is /wc?
[06:43] <radar1976> man wc
[06:43] <squeee> ZeeO: vlc likes it better when you copy then play them on your drive, but look up avahi tools to play things like that through vlc
[06:43] <cieffe> teledyn: syslog seems ok
[06:43] <nMosila> SirTwist__, Thanks, it work.
[06:43] <teledyn> cieffe: i think that's the name.  the gnome file monitoring daemon thing

[06:44] <woro2006> what about wc?
[06:44] <jenda-lappy> teledyn, I can't find my way around their website at all. Do they have any printer listings? I can't see any.
[06:44] <sorush20> fnf: I have never done that how do I do that pelase where is the file?
[06:44] <jrib> you've thoruoghly confused him
[06:44] <teledyn> jenda-lappy: yes they have a listing of all printers
[06:44] <cieffe> teledyn: yes, maybe you right, do you know how to stop it ?

[06:45] <ZeeO> o and can you get a GUI based unrar
[06:45] <ptr__> hi
[06:45] <teledyn> jenda-lappy: did you try to configure it via http://localhost:631   ?
[06:45] <fnf> sorush20: You might see that the file is in /etc from the errors.

[06:45] <jenda-lappy> teledyn, no, how?
[06:45] <nolimitsoya> what does a chroot do, exactly?
[06:45] <jenda-lappy> teledyn, nice, didn't know that existed.
[06:45] <blind> Okay, I have an issue. I started messing around with beryl and I somehow lost my 1280*1024 resolution. In an effort to get it back, I played with my xorg.conf, and actually took out all other resolutions from it. However, all the options are still in the Screen Resolution dialog and I still cannot get 1280*1024. Yes, I restarted X, I even rebooted my computer. It's as if my xorg.conf is not being read. Are there other files that influenc
[06:46] <SirTwist__> Icoo, http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/
[06:46] <SirTwist__> oh ... already solved

[06:46] <chad> is there a way to use a hardisk with winxp.. to boot in vmware?
[06:46] <NetVamp> Can someone explain to me why the free space on my ext3 partition gets smaller, even if I dont put any data on it?
[06:46] <fnf> sorush20: Can you restart to single mode ?.
[06:46] <nolimitsoya> fnf, thank you
[06:46] <phaedrus55> blind:   ctrl+alt+backspace   then  sudo dpk-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:46] <sorush20> fnf: don't know what that is
[06:46] <phaedrus55> blind:   ctrl+alt+backspace   then  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:47] <jrib> NetVamp: logs maybe?
[06:47] <NetVamp> I cant see any with ls -la
[06:47] <teledyn> jenda-lappy: www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi
[06:47] <NetVamp> there was an empty lost+found folder, I deleted that one and afterwards its grown another 300mb
[06:47] <blind> phaedrus55: reconfiguring my xorg.conf is not going to help, and i've already done it. I've also manually edited my xorg.conf, and to no avail.
[06:47] <dkr> NetVamp: don't do that, :)
[06:48] <ptr__> i have problem with .asoundrc and 5.1 sound, I manage to get all speakers working ( almost ) but now sound is intermittent and I can't run spear teast correctly
[06:48] <fnf> sorush20: To boot into single mode: Specify the param "single" in the line started with "/initrd" in the GRUB menu. When you see the GRUBmenu, press 'e' (or 'p' first for a password) on the ernel you want to boot.
[06:48] <bense> lol now rhythmbox is falling on it's face "gstreamer plugin mp3 is not found"

[06:48] <bense> AWESOME
[06:48] <savvas> nvidia beta driver shows 75hz vsync, but in gnome it shows 52hz, which one's the correct one?
[06:48] <POVaddct> NetVamp: deleting lost+found is a bad idea. it is neede for filesystem maintainance
[06:48] <dkr> NetVamp: lost+found is necessary for the filesystem to recover any lost blocks
[06:48] <jenda-lappy> teledyn, linuxprinting is no help in this case. They claim the printer works perfectly with the ljet4

[06:48] <woro2006> I am experiencing some R package errors
[06:49] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[06:49] <fnf> !single
[06:49] <woro2006> it keeps on saying error in X11: could not find any X11 fonts
[06:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about single - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:49] <phaedrus55> blind:  what card you have?
[06:49] <NetVamp> @dkr alright, so I shouldnt have done that
[06:49] <woro2006> Check that font path is correct
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> fnf, that didnt quite give me the awnser i needed... if i mount the live cd squashfs filesystem from an extracted cd, and chroot its dir, then mounts proc and sys, does that mean i moved into the live environment and a apt-get remove would remove things from that environment, or am i still in the same environment as before?
[06:49] <woro2006> I am using R
[06:49] <blind> phaedrus55: geforce 5200
[06:49] <NetVamp> still weird, I'll try to reformat that partition
[06:49] <Flamekebab> !flock
[06:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about flock - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:50] <savvas> is there a command to view vsync hertz through terminal?
[06:50] <blind> phaedrus55: i know my card and monitor can do it, i had it just a few days ago.
[06:50] <funkja> blind: Your horizontal and veritcal refresh rates can also effect which resolutions you are allowed to you. Look up the specs on your moniter and make sure that they are correct.
[06:50] <teledyn> savvas: xdpyinfo  ?
[06:50] <fnf> nolimitsoya: By the time you chrooted into the new environment, every commands you typed will have effect only in that environment.
[06:50] <blind> funkja: i've also done those manually in my xorg.conf
[06:50] <nolimitsoya> fnf, thank you :)
[06:51] <teledyn> maybe not
[06:51] <funkja> blind: can your monitor support 1280x1024
[06:51] <phaedrus55> blind:  #ubuntu-xgl       or try http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851
[06:51] <blind> funkja: yes.
[06:51] <teledyn> savvas: maybe just look in the Xorg log
[06:51] <ZeeO> i have ubuntu runing on a laptop hooked up to my TV with svideo whats a good media center like player ie. full screen and can use remote to play files not TV but just xvid wma etc
[06:51] <blind> phaedrus55: my beryl's already set up.
[06:52] <digitalhav0c> can some one lead me in the right direction im trying to setup a file-server i want to network all three of my computers 1 beening being a dedicated file server(running most likely 6.06LTS)  which is going to be hooked up to router wired, i have my desktop which runs windows xp which is hooked up wireless and my laptop which runs edgy
[06:52] <savvas> teledyn: where is it? :\
[06:52] <digitalhav0c> wireless
[06:52] <Berdine> Quick question... If I were to install Breezy and then update it to edgy, what are the chances of it going well? :3

[06:53] <digitalhav0c> what should i use able to share files on all three of them
[06:53] <nMosila> what about BitTorrent Port?
[06:53] <blind> pixelPOET: no
[06:53] <teledyn> savvas: in /var/log
[06:53] <fnf> digitalhav0c: It doesn't matter whether they're wireless or not, all you need to do is to setup the necessary shares.
[06:53] <nortonec> Hello
[06:53] <pixelPOET> blind, eh, c'est la vie...thanks
[06:53] <Berdine>  Oh, never mind, I can't even do that. :3
[06:53] <nMosila> Someone can tell to me ?

[06:54] <digitalhav0c> fnf, ok but could use nfs or should i use samba
[06:54] <nortonec> i can't install them
[06:54] <digitalhav0c> well at least thats what i've seen on the most off
[06:55] <fnf> sorush20: By default Ubuntu does not allow root login, so you can't really do anything administrative without modifying the sudoers, which also requires admin priviledge.
[06:55] <Flamekebab> sorry to keep asking this, but an answer has so far not been forth-coming
[06:55] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[06:56] <fnf> sorush20: You need to somehow modify the sudoers, one of which is to boot into single mode.
[06:56] <ashzilla> I have a question
[06:56] <therp> excuse me, is there a list of packages that ships with ubuntu's live/install cds?

[07:00] <NetVamp> Another question, the 5% reserved for the superuser (I guess root). What are those for?
[07:00] <lutero> ai
[07:00] <ashzilla> variant: it was one of the first things I did... I have a tiny bit of opacity from transparacy, too. I think the visual appeal outways the small bit of text clarity

[07:01] <woro2006> I didn't see a link

[07:05] <kronoman> a question : I just installed Ubuntu 6.06.1, and I want to remove the gnome games and Ekiga ; the thing is, when I try to remove them, the package manager wants to remove the entire ubuntu desktop, (all the apps, packages, etc)
[07:05] <cavall> helo
[07:05] <kronoman> so well, how I remove them without breaking my system
[07:06] <rich_> hey guys how can i change my refresh rate on edgy?  my only options are 51hz and 63hz when in dapper i had 75hz

[07:08] <kronoman> crap, I just installed 6.06 and 6.10 is out :o is worth that I update to 6.10 (and burn yet another CD) ?
[07:08] <cavall> hi l
[07:08] <variant> anette_: update-java-alternatives -l
[07:08] <kronoman> lorenzod: let me check if it is really trying to remove all
[07:08] <theo_> fnf: I type that @ terminal?
[07:08] <Kannix> rich_: There should be something like " HorizSync       28-51,  VertRefresh     43-60"
[07:09] <variant> kronoman: you can upgrade without reinstalling
[07:09] <fnf> theo_: Yup, it's synaptic.
[07:09] <anette_> variant, i get this after the command: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun
[07:09] <kronoman> variant: can I do it without burning another CD ?
[07:09] <towsonu2003> kronoman, 6.06 is a long term support version, you can keep using it. 6.10 is a little bit edgy (have hard edges)

[07:09] <variant> kronoman: then do apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
[07:09] <variant> kronoman: and your done
[07:10] <towsonu2003> kronoman, if you are going to upgrade to 6.10, be sure to read documentation on how to do that. it is reported to cause problems...

[07:10] <variant> kronoman: you shouldn't have any problems unless you used something like automatix to install stuff

[07:12] <theo_> I just need to install Crossweaver in my 64 bit installation of Ubuntu
[07:12] <variant> kronoman: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade first that way your system will be fully up to date dapper before upgrading to edgy
[07:12] <botxj> LjL: i do not need to know basic info i already know, i need help on why an repository doesnt work...
[07:12] <variant> kronoman: you won't have any problems if its a fresh install
[07:13] <theo_> fnf:  I need to install the Crossover application in order to run World of Warcraft in my 64 bit Ubuntu
[07:13] <rich_> http://pastebin.ca/231229 sorry Kannix
[07:13] <fnf> theo_: Synaptic is just a front-end of apt*, to install something supposedly in the repos, you need to select that in the paackage list then Apply.
[07:13] <rich_> thats all that is there
[07:13] <Kannix> rich_: Is that all?
[07:13] <kronoman> variant: and the disk space used by ubuntu will be the same, or will grow like "other" very known OS
[07:13] <rich_> thats it
[07:13] <soundray> fnf: judging by your advice, you haven't fully understood theo_'s problem
[07:13] <kronoman> I'm really trying to save disk space
[07:14] <fnf> soundray: Yes ?.
[07:14] <Kannix> rich_: then something is definately missing. Try "sudo Xorg -configure" and compare the resulting xorg.conf.
[07:14] <theo_> fnf:  I read here : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575 the steps carefully one by one
[07:14] <variant> kronoman: it will increase as you download the updates but you can then remove them once it is finnished
[07:14] <rich_> ok
[07:14] <fnf> soundray: crossweaver doesn't seem to be exist in Ubuntu's repos, I see.

I have Intel graphics, could this be a driver issue?

[07:15] <Gigs2> anyone here install picard recently successfully?  I get a broken dep on libtunepimp4, whatever that is.
[07:15] <towsonu2003> kronoman, I believe it will tell you how much extra space will be used

[07:15] <DarkFog> hello
[07:15] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[07:15] <Kannix> rich_: Mark the space there: Xorg -configure. It is an option, not one word.
[07:15] <rich_> <- dumass
[07:15] <kronoman> thanks for all the help so far, what I mean is, should be better to just download the 6.10, erase all the disk, and do a fresh install again ? (trying to save hard disk space)
[07:15] <rich_> :)
[07:16] <pumpkinhead> i burned isos, tried to boot, get to main screen, pick "install", get msg "I/O Error", dialog box only has button "reboot."  is there something wrong with the disc?
[07:16] <variant> Kannix: why not use dpkg-reconfigure Xorg
[07:16] <Lam_> my emacs has horribly small font. what happened to it?
[07:16] <DarkFog> can i instal ubuntu and windows at thhe same time
[07:16] <landexem> I'm having trouble getting my Broadcom wireless card working with Edgy... lspci returns "Broadcom Corporation BCM4309" but sudo iwconfig says that eth1 is "Nickname:"Broadcom 4306"
[07:16] <YBH_1> yes pumpkin head. Burn it onto the cd-rom at the lowest speed.
[07:16] <variant> DarkFog: what do you mean at the same time?
[07:16] <pumpkinhead> tks ybh
[07:16] <variant> DarkFog: you can have them both installed on the same disk
[07:16] <landexem> Why does one say 4309 and the other say 4306?  I followed the guide to install the firmware, but it still doesn't work.
[07:17] <variant> DarkFog: but you cant actualy do the isntall process at the same point in time
[07:17] <nowimproved> how do i turn off power saving
[07:17] <DarkFog> variant thats what i ment
[07:17] <nowimproved> when my monitor shuts off aftera while
[07:17] <Kannix> variant: Oh well, I wanted to see if the auto-configure works in any way. If it cannot detect the hardware properly, than he needs to manually tweak the xorg.conf, no?
[07:17] <chad> is there ANY way i can us my winxp disk..with vmware in linux?..i would hate to reinstall/format my winxp disk
[07:17] <fnf> theo_: I see, I've missed your first question way back then. I'll try to index the problem, but mine is not a 64bit box though.
[07:17] <theo_> fnf:  aha ... :( bad luck of mine I guess :(
[07:17] <soundray> nowimproved: System-Preferences-Screensaver
[07:17] <variant> Kannix: considering that his xorg.ocnf is 2 lines, he has alot of tweaking :)
[07:17] <DarkFog> to have them both on my laptop
[07:17] <Kannix> variant: And I can never remember those dpkg-<something> commands :)
[07:17] <nowimproved> i have fluxbox installed now soundray
[07:18] <kronoman> does this 6.10 version has that new "whole-search" thingy like Mac OS ?
[07:18] <Kannix> variant: No, that is just his monitor section.
[07:18] <towsonu2003> DarkFog, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot might help you
[07:18] <variant> Kannix: ah ok, thought he said that was the whole file lol
[07:18] <soundray> nowimproved: in that case, look for the screensaver configuration
[07:18] <Kannix> variant: So ideally, there are just three lines missing.
[07:18] <theo_> anyone else can help me plz? I will be in here ... just in case
[07:18] <nowimproved> soundray, i cant find it
[07:18] <Kannix> variant: Goodness, no :)
[07:18] <DarkFog> thanks
[07:19] <Flamekebab> I guess no one else on the planet uses, has used or ever will use Flock, then?
[07:19] <purefan> hi wise ones!
[07:20] <Kannix> Flamekebab: what is Flock?
[07:20] <Flamekebab> precisely..
[07:20] <ashzilla> variant: whatever PSI value I just entered did some weird stuff
[07:20] <kronoman> question about 6.10 : can I burn it on a 650 CD ? or I need one of those 700 MB one ?
[07:20] <Flamekebab> it's a browser built on Firefox
[07:20] <kronoman> because I have some blank 650 CDs here, but none of 700 MB
[07:20] <ashzilla> variant: I had to log out of my system for some reason to be able to launch a terminal outside off ttyl
[07:20] <soundray> nowimproved: in that case, try 'xset -dpms' in a terminal. It won't give any output, but should disable screen blanking.
[07:20] <Flamekebab> it's like Firefox with a load of extensions rolled into one package
[07:20] <MarcN> Flamekebab: debianadmin had some common edgy problems and fixes.  one was with flash crashing firefox.
[07:20] <towsonu2003> edgy users -> does your default firefox installation have any ubuntu-related search engines (where engines like google, amazon.com and so on are located)?
[07:20] <nashnash> who knows how to scan on black and white options on xsane,kooka or any scan program? i use HP Scanjet 3970 with driver hp3900-series. Thanks!
[07:20] <Flamekebab> Aye, I know, flash crashes FF
[07:20] <Flamekebab> I've fixed that though
[07:20] <Kannix> kronoman: Are there still 650s made?
[07:20] <nowimproved> soundray, what file can i define it in?
[07:20] <Flamekebab> by adding a line to /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
[07:21] <variant> ashzilla: odd, you probably forgot to coment the lines above it
[07:21] <variant> ashzilla: i should have mentioned that :)
[07:21] <Flamekebab> however, I don't know where to find the corresponding file for Flock
[07:21] <kronoman> Kannix: I have them stored since 5 years ago or so
[07:21] <kronoman> I have like a stock of 200 of them
[07:21] <purefan> im having a small issue with an incomplete install, the documentation for the JDK didnt download fine with the default apt-get install and now everytime I try to install something it asks me about it, saying 'no' all the time gets the job done but dont like it to show as it looks like something is fishy, Ive downloaded the documentation but dont know how to tell him "dude! its here!" :p
[07:21] <soundray> nowimproved: I don't know enough about fluxbox, sorry
[07:21] <Kannix> kronoman: ouch. They might be bad from storage now, anyhow.
[07:21] <nowimproved> what fiel does xset edit though?
[07:21] <kronoman> Kannix: hell, I have 5 1/4 floppys here, sealed in their plastic box
[07:22] <NetVamp> I really don't get it, I have a 20gb harddrive "hdb" I deleted the former partition on it with fdisk and recreated it, also with fdisk. Afterwards I used mkfs.ext3 -m 0 /dev/hdb1 to create a ext3 FS and now qtparted (Knoppix Partitiontool) tells me there are already 128MB taken, but there is nothing on it, except the lost+found folder, which is empty
[07:22] <soundray> nowimproved: it doesn't edit any file. Try man xset
[07:22] <Kannix> kronoman: Well, give it a try. Nothing much lost, if it does not work.
[07:22] <DarkFog> if i instal ubuntu will my programes be deleted, i have two partitions c and d, d has all my files (pics, music etc) and c has the windows!
[07:22] <NetVamp> I think thats really weird, or am I troubling myself over nothing?
[07:22] <ashzilla> Hi, since Edgy the keyboard binding properties have changed to only allow settings for Workspaces 1 and 2 - how can I change the keyboard bindings for an additional 3 and 4?
[07:22] <anette_> variant, could u help?
[07:22] <nowimproved> well then how will it work everytime i reboot?
[07:22] <LjL> ryanakca: how did the swappiness thing work out?
[07:22] <Kannix> DarkFog: You may want to make a backup of all important data before you start toying with repartitioning and installing other OSs
[07:23] <NetVamp> @DarkFog just make sure to have a backup, just in case. If you do it right nothing should happen to your files, but you know, nothing works out as planed ;)
[07:23] <variant> NetVamp: what is the -m 0 option for?
[07:23] <soundray> DarkFog: no, Ubuntu will try to resize your d: and install itself in the space gained. Listen to Kannix's advice!
[07:23] <NetVamp> set 0% reservation for the superuser
[07:23] <ashzilla> variant: whatver color code you gave me did not work
[07:23] <variant> ashzilla: yeah, see my comment about commenting in the lines above that in the file
[07:23] <ashzilla> variant: was there more than 1 line I had to change with that value?
[07:23] <DarkFog> i rn ubuntu from the cd without installing it nd i used the partitioner in the os, and nthn happenned to the files!
[07:24] <purefan> 1st Bump: the documentation for the JDK didnt download fine with the default apt-get install and now everytime I try to install something it asks me about it, saying 'no' all the time gets the job done but dont like it to show as it looks like something is fishy, Ive downloaded the documentation but dont know how to tell him "dude! its here!" :p
[07:24] <variant> ashzilla: yeah, sorry, i forgot to mention you had to coment the above lines
[07:24] <variant> ashzilla: sorry
[07:24] <DarkFog> should i procced with the installation
[07:24] <NetVamp> or at least -m should let you tell mkfs how much percent to reserve, so I believe 0 should be 0
[07:24] <UmbraAdmin> pleas im new to Ubuntu how can i easyaly enable all ports ?
[07:24] <theo_> fnf:  new info on my case mate ...
[07:24] <soundray> DarkFog: in that case, the most dangerous step is already done
[07:24] <ashzilla> variant: comment what lines? I made a backup of my .bashrc, removed my PSI= line and pasted your's - where was the error?
[07:24] <theo_> fnf:  in step 5 in line 3 ... sudo ln -s /usr/sbin/synaptic /usr/sbin/synaptic32
[07:24] <jaks> is firefox 2 coming to dapper?
[07:24] <towsonu2003> UmbraAdmin, can you be more specific? such as, why do you wanna enable all ports, and what do you mean by "enabling" ports?
[07:25] <ashzilla> jaks: why not just upgrade to edgy, it's by far the most superior ubuntu version yet.
[07:25] <theo_> fnf:  I get this error :

[07:25] <|rt|> jaks: ubuntu locks versions shortly before release...so there will never be firefox2 in dapper...atleast not from a ubuntu repository
[07:25] <jaks> ashzilla: because dappers working lovely.
[07:26] <variant> ashzilla: you see that?
[07:26] <chad> how can i change the location of my /home folder? i want it on another disk/partition.
[07:26] <UmbraAdmin> that way i dont have to bother with that step in setting up the actual server
[07:26] <jaks> so much for long term support?
[07:26] <Kannix> rich_: What kind of monitor do you have? How old is it? Does it support DPMS?
[07:26] <purefan> last Bump: the documentation for the JDK didnt download fine with the default apt-get install and now everytime I try to install something it asks me about it, saying 'no' all the time gets the job done but dont like it to show as it looks like something is fishy, Ive downloaded the documentation but dont know how to tell him "dude! its here!" :p
[07:26] <kronoman> are ultra DMA and other stuff to improve hard disk enabled by default in 6.06 and/or 6.10 ??
[07:26] <ashzilla> jaks: I guess, I dealt with some crap about getting X working, but all is well now
[07:26] <variant> chad: cp it to the new location and set a line in /etc/fstab that points your new home partition to /home
[07:26] <|rt|> jaks: no they fully support the versions that it shipped with
[07:26] <kronoman> I remember the time of hdparm and such stuff
[07:26] <ashzilla> variant: Yes, that seems like what I had
[07:26] <UmbraAdmin> )

[07:27] <gutis> www.one.lt
[07:27] <Sarek> chad, just mount the other partition to /home so that /home/yourlogin is actually stored on that partition
[07:27] <variant> chad: make sure you use cp -p (preserve permissions)

[07:27] <Adam-g> Hello. Can someone tell me where the configuration file for Apache is if I installed it from the repository?
[07:27] <soundray> chad: plain old cp will change the times and permissions on your files
[07:27] <jaks> |rt|: ahh well i dont like that. not very dapper friendly
[07:27] <towsonu2003> UmbraAdmin, as ubunu doesn't have any firewalls configured out of the box, as you start servers, their ports will be open and listening. without something listening to a port, I don't think there is a point to open a port (and I don't know how to do that)
[07:28] <variant> Adam-g: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
[07:28] <soundray> chad: there is a tip in the Tips-HOWTO (search the web) for moving files between filesystems using tar
[07:28] <_Brandon_> i've a dwl-520+ and i've installed acx100 drivers but the signal is very low and i can't find any ap or other devices but with ndiswrapper i've no problem

[07:28] <variant> Adam-g: or /etc/apache/apache.conf if your not using apache2
[07:28] <jaks> and, if i were to upgrade to edgy, if i finally made the switch to amd64, is it easy to run 32 bit apps now?
[07:28] <fnf> theo_: Following the tutorials, I'm sort of grabbed the steps now. Can you re-descrive the errors you got ?.
[07:28] <variant> chad: as i said, just cp -p
[07:28] <rich_> it is a samsung SyncMaster 204b i haven't had it a year yet
[07:29] <Adam-g> variant, thanks
[07:29] <kronoman> I'm going for 6.10, should I close everything that I'm running ?
[07:29] <kronoman> using the update manager
[07:29] <variant> chad: as i said, just cp -p -R actualy, recursive is important

[07:30] <landexem> lspci tells me I have a Broadcom BCM4309 wireless card, but I've seen it being reported as a BCM4306
[07:30] <landexem> Which one is it and how can I *really* tell?
[07:30] <Sarek> chad, the diskspace you get then depends on the size of the partition you mount to /home sure
[07:30] <variant> chad: so, make your new parititon and mount it somwhere (/mnt will do) then sudo cp -Rp /home/ /mnt/

[07:31] <Sarek> chad,  but do as variant says ... his explanations are very good ;-)
[07:31] <landexem> soundray: Are there logs I can check to tell?
[07:31] <chad> ah, nice.. just wanted more space thats all:)
[07:31] <theo_> fnf:  what should I do about the pastebin? what info do u want me to paste in there?
[07:31] <fnf> theo_: line 3 just creates a symlink, what should cause it to invoke dpkg ?
[07:31] <variant> chad: dont forget to remount it as /home

[07:34] <variant> ashzilla: why>? if you put the file in correctly you should see what i have

[07:34] <hister> how do I make screen use a different key other than ctrl-a as the main control character? for instance, if I want to run screen on my machine, and in one of those windows I want to login to another machine and use screen inside of screen

[07:35] <soundray> landexem: yes, if you have a choice. When you want us here to see your errors, please use pastebin (see topic)
[07:35] <hister> or conversely, how come when I install ubuntu server edition, pressing ctrl+f2 for instance does not give me another tty?
[07:35] <theo_> fnf:  done!
[07:35] <theo_> fnf: now?
[07:35] <fnf> theo_: Then repeat line 2 ?
[07:35] <soundray> OXIj: you'd have to reinstall
[07:35] <variant> hister: because its alt+f2
[07:35] <hister> variant: no
[07:35] <variant> hister: yes
[07:35] <hister> no it does not make a new window appear
[07:35] <soundray> hister: try Alt-F2 or Ctrl-Alt-F2
[07:36] <nolimitsoya> is there a way to start x in a chrooted environment?
[07:36] <OXIj> soundray, if i reinstall then will all my settings will be eraced?
[07:36] <dcraven> hister, C-A-F2
[07:36] <hister> I meant ctrl+alt+f2, but I just tried alt+f2
[07:36] <ashzilla> variant: just a bunch more errors printed to screen when I start bash
[07:36] <variant> hister: alt+f2 in a virtual terminal will switch you to your second vt
[07:36] <theo_> fnf:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29571/
[07:36] <hister> neither are bringing me to a new tty, even though I saw all of them get initialised in bootup

I'm rather leery of upgrading because I sit in here and see this line of people coming in with a laundry list of things that just stopped working when they upgraded, assuming the whole process didn't completely melt down on them
[07:36] <variant> ashzilla: ok, sorry but you must have done somthing wrong
[07:36] <theo_> fnf:  error again :(
[07:36] <fnf> theo_: wait
[07:36] <soundray> OXIj: yes. Make a backup first. Or restore from the dapper backup you made before you went to edgy.
[07:36] <hister> variant: I want to believe you but it's not working, and yeah that is what it is normally
[07:37] <morrye> With what software can I burn an image to a cd?
[07:37] <Zaggynl> What does this mean in hamachi when I ping someone: 'ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted'
[07:37] <variant> hister: perhaps your allready on vt 2?
[07:37] <soundray> OXIj: best yet, solve your problems in edgy and stick with it.
[07:37] <hister> could it have something to do with this being server rather than desktop? that's the only varying thing than what I normally use
[07:37] <nolimitsoya> morrye, k3b
[07:37] <variant> hister: try f1/f3/f4

[07:37] <ashzilla> variant: I saved the file as a .txt, there was no room for error.
[07:37] <variant> ashzilla: you shouldnt add a file extension to the filename
[07:37] <soundray> hister: the virtual consoles are configured in /etc/inittab. Check that file.
[07:37] <variant> ashzilla: the file is called bashrc not bashrc.txt
[07:38] <fnf> theo_: then 'sudo groupadd postfix', really, I haven't seen these groups in a 32 bit Ubuntu system.
[07:38] <variant> ahaller: and it is hidden so it has a . at the start: ~/.bashrc

[07:38] <variant> gubuntu: create a firewall rule that blocks all from that ip
[07:39] <hister> soundray: rather confusing syntax, what am I looking for?
[07:39] <fnf> theo_: It should be 'sudo useradd postfix'.
[07:39] <gubuntu> any howto?
[07:39] <ashzilla> variant: I remember renaming it correctly when I was saving it from firefox
[07:39] <variant> gubuntu: thi sis why you shoul dhave good passwords or you key based authentication
[07:39] <OXIj> soundray, i now, but i need internet working to solve problems. but IT doesnt work! it sayd that modem resist adress and firmware cant load
[07:39] <variant> ashzilla: if you do less /home/username/.bashrc do you get the file i showed you?
[07:39] <gubuntu> i have a great password and ill work on getting key auth, but right now i want to sopt this particular address
[07:39] <ashzilla> aaaahhhh! How can I set a key binding to switch to workspace 3 or 4?
[07:39] <variant> gubuntu: you have a firewall?
[07:39] <theo_> fnf:  it says that : useradd: group postfix exists - if you want to add this user to that group, use -g.
[07:39] <soundray> hister: this line: '2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty2'
[07:40] <gubuntu> no idea, fresh dapper install
[07:40] <dcraven> ashzilla, Keyboard Shortcuts menu item.
[07:40] <variant> gubuntu: install a firewall, firestarter is nice and easy
[07:40] <fnf> theo_: 'sudo groupdel postfix' then adding the postfix user.
[07:40] <landexem> soundray: pastebin is taking ages, is there an ubuntu0specific pastbin site?

[07:40] <ashzilla> dcraven: that's why I'm having a problem

[08:15] <dommie> there's no sound PERIOD
[08:15] <naderman> Badkitty: do you have any idea what could cause wpasupplicant to do nothing? Or how to make it spit out errors? -dd doesn't give any information
[08:15] <highneko_> ZirJoker: I always thought that meant gimp. Does it really exist?!
[08:15] <dommie> not just with certain formats
[08:15] <ZirJoker> yes it does exists
[08:15] <dv_> dommie, soundcard?
[08:15] <flujan> i am having problems with my screen resolution in edgy eft
[08:15] <dv_> some ac97 one?
[08:15] <highneko_> Is it more link photoshop?
[08:15] <dcraven> highneko_, it's gimp with hacked menus.
[08:15] <ZirJoker> its a.... more photoshop-like gimp
[08:15] <flujan> ubuntu detects and configure the system with 1024x768
[08:15] <variant> !e17
[08:15] <ubotu> Enlightenment (or "E") is a window manager for X, providing a useful, and good looking graphical shell in which to work. E17 is the current development version.
[08:15] <ZirJoker> its like a original gimp modification
[08:15] <slinky_> highneko: lol, now i have the problem back again, i'll reinstall both applications and reinstall the plugins
[08:15] <dommie> lspci:  Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller
[08:15] <flujan> I cannot lower the configuration to 800x600 is it a ubuntu bug?
[08:16] <dv_> ok, I have a similar one
[08:16] <dv_> what apps did you try?
=== radar___76 is now known as radar1976
[08:16] <ZirJoker> so does anyone here uses it?
[08:16] <highneko_> dcraven: Someone said to me today "I would try linux but I like photoshop so much" I said try gimp or inkscape.
[08:16] <dommie> xmms, flash, timidity
[08:16] <ZirJoker> inkscape??
[08:16] <ZirJoker> is it more photoshop-like?
[08:16] <dommie> even from System > Preferences > Sound
[08:17] <jaks> highneko_: should've told them to use wine
[08:17] <highneko_> scalable vector graphic thing.
[08:17] <dcraven> highneko_, yeah. Or if they have to have it, I heard it works in crossover.
[08:17] <dv_> hmm type "ps -e | grep esd"
[08:17] <jaks> ZirJoker: not really
[08:17] <variant> highneko_: gimp sucks in comparison to phtoshops usability
[08:17] <dv_> is there a result?
[08:17] <ZirJoker> xD
[08:17] <dommie> it's running
[08:17] <jaks> Inkscape is for drawing vector graphics..
[08:17] <dcraven> ZirJoker, it's nothing like PS or gimp. It's an SVG editor.
[08:17] <highneko_> variant: That's what I kinda said, and suggested inkscape.
[08:17] <variant> there is no drop in replacement for photoshop for gnu/linux
[08:17] <slinky_> anyway to play Diablo II in ubuntu?
[08:17] <ZirJoker> xDDD
[08:17] <variant> highneko_: inkscape is a vector editor
[08:17] <dv_> variant, actually not. but the thing is that the photoshop interface is a de-facto industry standard
[08:17] <variant> dv_: correct
[08:17] <jeffde> any chance i can get font rendering as good as xo with cleartype on ubuntu? I have tried a few patches here and there, but still to my eyes it's still not even close. There must be something
[08:17] <dv_> dommie, type killall esd
[08:17] <Supremacygnu> slinky_: yes with wine
[08:17] <ZeeO> i tryed to install gnomeradio and it did't work then i tryed to go apt-get remove and it just gets stuck
[08:17] <variant> dv_: for good reason
[08:17] <highneko_> variant: Yes, I jsut said that. I told them that too.
[08:17] <ZeeO> what can i do
[08:18] <dv_> variant, but this really eliminates any chance of competing unless one copies the UI
[08:18] <dommie> ok
[08:18] <ZeeO> now when ever i installed packages it locks up
[08:18] <dv_> dommie, then try timidity again
[08:18] <dommie> do i need a -9 ?
[08:18] <variant> dv_: yup
[08:18] <ZirJoker> anyway i have the gimp (gimpshop) in spanish, and i want to change it to english because im more familiar with it (even if im mexican)
[08:18] <variant> dv_: gimp ui sucks tbh
[08:18] <dv_> probably
[08:18] <dv_> try without it first
[08:18] <ZirJoker> do you know any ay to change the language?
[08:18] <dcraven> I like gimp's UI.
[08:18] <Supremacygnu> slinky_: well, it works perfect with wine...
[08:18] <dcraven> But I've not used PS before.
[08:19] <dv_> bah. the intel chipsets can mix in hardware, no need for esd there. so why does ubuntu install it anyway?
[08:19] <dommie> still nothing
[08:19] <Ratzilla> dos xgl/compiz work with dapper properly?
[08:19] <variant> Ratzilla: yup
[08:19] <dv_> dommie, try playing with mplayer
[08:19] <slinky_> Supremacygnu: i had trouble installing it
[08:19] <ZeeO> can i some how just make apt-get forget about the gnomeradio
[08:19] <Ratzilla> variant: awesome :)
[08:19] <dv_> or does timidity say something?
[08:19] <ZeeO> so i can just install what i need
[08:19] <variant> Ratzilla: it's better with aiglx
[08:19] <variant> Ratzilla: on edgy that is
[08:19] <variant> Ratzilla: and if your chipset supports it
[08:19] <dommie> timidity doesn't say anything
[08:19] <highneko_> Yes, I use aiglx on edgy. Very nice.
[08:20] <dv_> hmm
[08:20] <dommie> well, no errors, i mean
[08:20] <ZirJoker> do you know any ay to change the GIMP (GIMPSHOP) language???
[08:20] <dkr> is anyone using nedit successfully on edgy? (I just upgraded from dapper and when i try to run nedit I get: "X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)  Major opcode of failed request:  70 (X_PolyFillRectangle)"  already tried aptitude reinstall
[08:20] <dcraven> ZirJoker, I'm guessing nobody knows.
[08:20] <ZirJoker> u.u
[08:20] <Ratzilla> edgy? damnit, i just installed dapper x.x
[08:20] <dv_> dommie, type apt-get install alsamixergui
[08:20] <variant> Ratzilla: xgl works with dapper
[08:20] <dv_> maybe the master and/or pcm channel are simply muted
[08:21] <dkr> I can't even figure out if that's a problem with nedit or xorg, :)
[08:21] <dv_> in edgy I dont need to compile anything for xgl/aiglx, right?
[08:21] <dommie> ok, it's running
[08:21] <Ratzilla> variant: does updating distro version work with ubuntu well now? i remember when i went from breezy to dapper, it wasnt the best..
[08:21] <variant> dv_: dont think so
[08:21] <dv_> and with the nvidia drivers I dont even need aiglx I suppose
[08:21] <jaks> variant: would you know which chipsets do support aiglx? if there a list?
[08:21] <dv_> with the 9xxx ones
[08:21] <variant> Ratzilla: some people have had problems
[08:21] <dv_> dommie, and? the channels are ok?
[08:21] <wogi> My Ubuntu-ers.. If I want to guarentee my system runs updates every night, is it reasonable to create a file called /etc/cron.daily/dist-upgrade and put into it this line?: /usr/bin/apt-get update && /usr/bin/apt-get -y dist-upgrade
[08:21] <variant> jaks: the only ones that work with aiglx at the momment are those with open source drivers
[08:22] <variant> jaks: radeon 9200 or less
[08:22] <wogi> Or, is there a better way?
[08:22] <slinky_> has anyone had success with installing an ATI Readon 7200 ISA video card
[08:22] <Ratzilla> variant: oh okay, thanks, i guess i can just nab edgy and then use aiglx on it
[08:22] <variant> Ratzilla: what graphics card do you use?
[08:22] <jaks> variant: so my 9200SE stands a chance then
[08:22] <variant> jaks: should work
[08:22] <Ratzilla> variant: i have a nvidia 6600 go
[08:22] <variant> jaks: out of the box
[08:22] <PSUSI> oh my god, an ISA video card?  I thought they have not made those in 6-8 years?
[08:22] <variant> Ratzilla: you have to use xgl then
[08:22] <PSUSI> at least...
[08:22] <dommie> the first slider is labeled "Head..." and has no level... but i can't change it
[08:23] <PSUSI> more like 10 now
[08:23] <dv_> variant, he could also use the beta drivers
[08:23] <jaks> i will give it a go when i've finished downloading the iso - thanks variant
[08:23] <variant> dv_: cool, they support it now ey?
[08:23] <Ratzilla> variant: whats the main difference between the two?
[08:23] <dv_> since Xgl is alpha, it evens the score :)
[08:23] <dv_> variant, yeah. you dont even need aiglx
[08:23] <Asc_> I have a package with a broken dependency.  To fix the dependency, I have to remove opera.  Apt doesn't want to remove opera until I fix the broken dependency.  Anybody have a suggestion as to how to go about fixing this?
[08:23] <variant> Ratzilla: xgl is a complete rewrite of xorg by novell whereas aiglx is just continued development of the xorg tree and was worked on by freedesktop.org and redhat
[08:24] <dv_> dommie, everything ok?
[08:24] <variant> dv_: aiglx is better
[08:24] <dommie> no
[08:24] <variant> dv_: as it is part of the xorg distribution
[08:24] <ashzilla> variant: xgl is all a part of novell?
[08:24] <dommie> dv_: the first slider is labeled "Head.." and is all the way down, but i can't move it up at all
[08:24] <ashzilla> variant: I saw your screenshot, are you using xgl or aiglx?
[08:24] <dv_> variant, the nvidia driver has it built in
[08:24] <morgue> hi y'll
[08:24] <variant> ashzilla: afaik, xgl was entirely written by novel engineer
[08:24] <variant> ashzilla: aiglx
[08:25] <dv_> dommie, strange
[08:25] <variant> ashzilla: and novel did some of it behind closed doors
[08:25] <dv_> dommie, try to press left
[08:25] <theo_> fnf:  mate sorry to busting your chops but I did the steps again in that site and in step 3 I got this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29586/
[08:25] <soundray> Asc_: can you pastebin the output of 'sudo apt-get -f install' pls
[08:25] <slinky_> good bye folks, thanks
[08:25] <dv_> err wait
[08:25] <soundray> !pastebin | Asc_
[08:25] <ubotu> Asc_: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[08:25] <dv_> I mean SCROLL left
[08:25] <ashzilla> variant: which one was first of the two... aiglx or xgl? it seems like xgl is MUCH more popular
[08:25] <samu2> ok, so... i did a fresh install of ubuntu and i have the same problem as when i tried the live cd. just a few seconds after gnome loads, i get booted out to the login screen with no warning or explanation
[08:25] <richee> Can someone tell about compiz
[08:25] <richee> !compiz
[08:25] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing (window) manager) and XGL (Xserver architecture layered on top of OpenGL) howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager XGL+compiz help in #ubuntu-xgl  See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[08:25] <Ratzilla> variant: so m video card isnt supported by aiglx? thats fine as long as i can use compiz..im downloading edgy right now and then illl use xgl..thanks
[08:25] <variant> imo, it's novell trying to take control of development of a central core of the gnu/linux system (x)
[08:25] <dv_> the first one should be labeled "Master"
[08:25] <cntb> !vnc >cntb
[08:25] <B_166-ER-X> !resolution
[08:25] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[08:25] <hawk_> !beryl
[08:25] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl. Thank You.
[08:26] <dommie> dv_ : negative.  the first one is labeled "Head.."
[08:26] <morgue> guys, firefox 2.0 is crashing when I try to open http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/carreviews/03/01/cr_reliability/index.html do you have any suggestions?
[08:26] <WikinG> question about OOo - how to put page landscape?
[08:26] <Cmcrae> I have a few questions about Ubunto Linux... 1) How do I make it so Ubunto Desktop does not start in X. 2) How do I go and set up the root account and password
[08:26] <dommie> dv_ : the window is maximized
[08:26] <dv_> dommie, really strange
[08:26] <RasmusseN> does the new 6.10 have any less support than 6.06? ubuntu didn't work on the versions i've tried awile back now that i've heard of someone installing ubuntu on my system I want to try it again.
[08:26] <dv_> variant, the nvidia driver exposes EXT_texture_from_pixmap directly
[08:26] <dv_> so no need for aiglx there
[08:26] <Asc_> soundray: working on it.  Modem is a little slow.
[08:26] <PSUSI> !root
[08:26] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:26] <variant> dv_: ok, however aiglx is better for the aforementioned reasons
[08:26] <dommie> dv_ : Head, Front, Front Mic, Mic, Capture, Capture 1, Capture 2, Caller ID, Input Source, Input Source 1, Input Source 2, Off-h..
[08:26] <variant> dv_: xgl is about to die a slow death
[08:26] <soundray> WikinG: Format-Page-Page
[08:27] <dv_> variant, doesnt matter
[08:27] <dv_> variant, I am not defending xgl
[08:27] <PSUSI> Cmcrae: see above for root, as for disabling X, go into the services applet and disable gdm
[08:27] <BooBar> Cmcrae: your root is the fristr account you createall root canal work is done vir sudo
[08:27] <RancidLM> hey all.. im having a small problem with ubuntu 6.10 after grub loads and when the splash screen is supposed to appear.. my LCD monitor goes out of sync until GDM loads.. can some one help me configure the kernal splash to work with my monitor?
[08:27] <dv_> this extension is the REALLY important part
[08:27] <variant> dv_: now that aiglx will work on modern proprietry graphics cards
[08:27] <RasmusseN> whats wrong with xgl?
[08:27] <wogi> Best way to automate apt-get dist-upgrade?
[08:27] <variant> dv_: yeah, it enables the drivers to work iwth aiglx instead of just xgl
[08:27] <theo_> in case that anyone can help me here is my trouble... I have ubuntu 64 installed and when trying to install crossover in order to run World of Warcraft
[08:27] <dv_> xgl is a complete rewrite
[08:27] <theo_> I get an error about missing 32 bit libs
[08:27] <dv_> and has serious issues with gl apps
[08:27] <Cmcrae> I don't want to disable X all I want to do is stop ubunto from starting in it...
[08:27] <richee> !java
[08:27] <dv_> because its like gl-in-gl
[08:27] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:27] <WikinG> sundray, thnx!
[08:27] <theo_> I tried to do what this page says : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
[08:28] <variant> RasmusseN: its a fork of xorg-x11 while aiglx is just continued development of xorg
[08:28] <Asc_> soundray: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29588/ . It's a little hard to read because it keeps whining about my locale (which is also broken, for reasons unknown) but I think that can be ignored.
[08:28] <PSUSI> theo_: wine is not availible on 64 bit atm, you will have to set up a 32bit chroot
[08:28] <theo_> but in step 3 I get errors ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29586/
[08:28] <dv_> variant, no. as I said, the drivers expose it directly. they do it by themselves, just like their own DRI instead of the kernel one
[08:28] <variant> RasmusseN: with aiglx you can just click a button to turn it on or off
[08:28] <PSUSI> Cmcrae: that would be the meaning of disable... at least the meaning I intended
[08:28] <anette_> can someone help me with this error when trying to launch azureus: Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (1.5.0_08-b03 mixed mode, sharing) ?
[08:28] <bdragonmsl> !aiglx
[08:28] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[08:28] <variant> dv_: yeah, so it works with aiglx or xgl.. like we are both agreeing on
[08:28] <Cmcrae> Another question. Where can I gain information about installing a 7 port usb hub for Ubunto
[08:28] <RasmusseN> variant: why would you want to turn it off?
[08:28] <Ratzilla> variant: turn compiz on and off? will that automatically load the gnome-panel?
[08:29] <theo_> PSUSI:  that is what I was trying to complete ... but got this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29586/ in step 3 of here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
[08:29] <morgue> guys, firefox 2.0 is crashing when I try to open http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/carreviews/03/01/cr_reliability/index.html do you have any suggestions?
[08:29] <PSUSI> Cmcrae: what information?  You just plug it in
[08:29] <dommie> dv_ : any ideas?
[08:29] <dv_> variant, no. aiglx and xgl are unnecessary with this
[08:29] <variant> Ratzilla: i turn it off sometimes cus it can get annoying.. once the themes are more mature and a bit less tacky it will be better as default :)
[08:29] <Ratzilla> morgue: what kind of error do you get? segmentation fault?
[08:29] <JDStone> morgue: it could be a plugin that the page is using
[08:29] <RasmusseN> morgue: there's not much anyone can probably do it's probably the websites fault.
[08:29] <rich_> ok I have tried running dpkg-reconfigure and selecting medium.  In my xorg.conf I have Horizsync and vertrefresh set but i still do not get options in preferences
[08:29] <dv_> dommie, no. your error is really, really strange.
[08:29] <dv_> I mean ... no Master channeL?
[08:29] <variant> dv_: if you don't mind using proprietry drivers (and i do mind)
[08:29] <dv_> never heard of that.
[08:29] <morgue> I don't get no error, it just closes
[08:30] <Thib_> sorry
[08:30] <morgue> I have no extensions besides flash
[08:30] <dave> i'm trying to install a package via synaptic, but it says that one of the dependancies  isn't  installable, is this something that needs reporting to whoever controls the repositaries?
[08:30] <Thib_> I was stuck in a ping timeout
[08:30] <dv_> variant, I have no choice. I need shader functionality, the free ones dont have them
[08:30] <JDStone> morgue: flash 9?>
[08:30] <soundray> Asc_: run 'sudo dpkg --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_1%3a7.1.1ubuntu6_i386.deb' and consider filing a bug against opera (it should not provide /usr/X11R6/bin)
[08:30] <RasmusseN> I am downloading Ubuntu 6.10 for my Shuttle ST20G5 :-D
[08:30] <JDStone> morgue: flash 9?
[08:30] <dommie> dv_ : sometimes the sound works... sometimes it doesn't
[08:30] <Thib_> I don't know how much of my question made it
[08:30] <dv_> dommie, are you sure the hw is ok?
[08:30] <dommie> dv_ : when it works, it works for the whole sessions, and when it doesn't, it doesn't
[08:30] <morgue> JDStone: latest?
[08:30] <dommie> dv_ : brand new lappy... better be ok!
[08:30] <dv_> oh, a laptop
[08:30] <ZirJoker> does anybody knows how to change the gimp language???
[08:30] <RasmusseN> everytime i've tried a a distro of linix it hasn't worked i've tried ubuntu twice
[08:30] <JDStone> morgue: yes
[08:30] <dommie> dv_ : works fine in windows
[08:30] <dv_> laptops are a harder thing to crack with linux
[08:31] <PSUSI> theo_: is there a reason you are still running hoary?  that is VERY old
[08:31] <morgue> JDStone, yes I installed it like a week ago
[08:31] <dv_> but your chipset should be known
[08:31] <Cmcrae> So If I plug in the hub and then the HDDs into the hub they will auto mount
[08:31] <RancidLM> how do i configure the kernel boot splash resolution?
[08:31] <JDStone> morgue: I have a friend that has the same problems
[08:31] <Ratzilla> ubuntu on laptop? ive ran breezy and dapper and its been fine...
[08:31] <theo_> PSUSI:  I have 6.10 installed in 64 bit
[08:31] <Supremacygnu> how do I check how large a file or folder is thrue the terminal?
[08:31] <JDStone> morgue: when he tries to view a page with any flash, it just closes
[08:31] <RasmusseN> should i have any problems running a X800XL @ 1680x1050 60Hz?
[08:31] <dv_> anyway, I dont have any idea what causes your problem. already started a thread in the forums?
[08:31] <theo_> PSUSI:  trouble is I need to install Crossover in order to run World of Warcraft
[08:31] <PSUSI> theo_: then your sources.list is misconfigured because your output you pasted says apt-get is downloading from hoary
[08:31] <dommie> no, i was hoping to find a solution here first
[08:32] <theo_> PSUSI:  and another fella said that the solution to my problem is http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
[08:32] <morgue> JDStone, flash fucks up ff heh
[08:32] <dv_> variant, but its a pity that Xgl is obsolete. the name is cool :)
[08:32] <soundray> !language | morgue
[08:32] <ubotu> morgue: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:32] <JDStone> morgue: it sure does
[08:32] <RasmusseN> should i have any problems running a X800XL @ 1680x1050 60Hz in ubuntu 6.10?
[08:32] <theo_> PSUSI:  so what do I must do?
[08:32] <Thib_> I'll assume none of my question made it.
[08:32] <Thib_> before I got disconnected.
[08:32] <morgue> JDStone, no clue then?
[08:32] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: running what? just using that resolution?
[08:32] <PSUSI> theo_: you need to replace "hoary" with "edgy" in that tutorial
[08:32] <sassaroli> Who can spent a few minites helping a newbie solve his linux problems???
[08:32] <ashzilla> Question
[08:33] <Supremacygnu> how do I check how large a file or folder is thrue the terminal?
[08:33] <JDStone> morgue: does the page have flash on it?
[08:33] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: Yes, just running it and will i need any drivers for my X800XL?
[08:33] <soundray> Supremacygnu: ls -l
[08:33] <Asc_> soundray: It looks as though it's working.  Thanks a whole lot.  I don't know what opera's deal is - there was a link to it in that directory.  I seem to recall I installed it from a non-supported package.
[08:33] <Supremacygnu> soundray: thanks
[08:33] <ashzilla> Is the 2.6.17-10-generic kernel the -686 version of the 2.6.17 series?
[08:33] <Thib_> I upgraded my laptop from Dapper to Edgy, and Hibernate doesn't seem to work anymore.
[08:33] <morgue> Does it? I don't know I can't open it, it's: http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/carreviews/03/01/cr_reliability/index.html do you have any suggestions?
[08:33] <Asc_> (downloaded from the opera web site, though)
[08:33] <rich_> how come ubuntu isnt reading the refresh rates in xorg.conf?
[08:34] <fydo> RasmusseN: I have that card, works fine in 1280x1024 for me
[08:34] <Thib_> the machine seems to go through the motions -- blank screen, a pop in the sound card, intense disk activity -- but it doesn't power off at the end.
[08:34] <rich_> my only refresh rate option is either 50 or 63
[08:34] <morgue> JDStone, the page is http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/carreviews/03/01/cr_reliability/index.html
[08:34] <RasmusseN> morgue: works for me running windows using firefox 2.0
[08:34] <Thib_> it just goes back to the password prompt from the screensaver, like when it comes back from hibernating.
[08:34] <rich_> and only 60 for lower resolutions ie. 800X600
[08:34] <JDStone> RasmusseN: that's windows though
[08:34] <Asc_> Could somebody do a quick echo '$LC_ALL' and tell me what it returns?
[08:34] <soundray> Thib_: make sure that the upgrade didn't change the settings in /etc/default (e.g. /etc/default/acpi-support)
[08:34] <theo_> PSUSI:  trying now ...
[08:35] <morgue> RasmusseN, yeah I'm on Ubuntu
[08:35] <JDStone> morgue: yep, there's flash on the page
[08:35] <Thib_> hmm
[08:35] <spawn> Hello
[08:35] <jaks> OOOOOH i have a free partition. edgy and dapper here i come!
[08:35] <morgue> JDStone, so that might be the problem then
[08:35] <Thib_> I don't know what those defaults should be
[08:35] <Thib_> it just worked before, I never had to worry about setting settings
[08:35] <RasmusseN> morgue check your error console in firefox.
[08:35] <raqball> Edgy is real slow on my latop... Sticking with dapper for now
[08:35] <morgue> RasmusseN, how?
[08:35] <JDStone> morgue: very possible.  try removing the flash plugin, using your package manager and then try the site again
[08:36] <JDStone> morgue: gtg, good luck on that
[08:36] <RasmusseN> well for windows it's Tools>Error Console
[08:36] <morgue> JDStone, how do i remove it?
[08:36] <preglow> do i need to install some extra package to be able to compile ordinary 32 bit binaries on amd64 box?
[08:36] <Ratzilla> morgue: go into terminal, open firefox and go to that link. and then see what exit message is inputed to the terminal
[08:36] <morgue> JDStone, kk thanks
[08:36] <soundray> Thib_: check if any file names end in .dpkg-old. Compare the old ones with the current, and decide whether the changes (if any) affect the hibernate behaviour.
[08:36] <spawn> Can someone explain to me how can I use my S-Video on my video card?
[08:36] <ashzilla> Is the 2.6.17-10-generic kernel the -686 version of the 2.6.17 series?
[08:36] <rich_> this is frustrating i have a brand new install of edgy and i can't control my refresh rates
[08:36] <RasmusseN> morgue: well for windows it's Tools>Error Console
[08:36] <JDStone> morgue: apt-get remove flash, I think
[08:36] <soundray> !tvout | spawn
[08:36] <ubotu> spawn: For help with enabling the TV-Out on certain NVidia cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOutNewbieEdition
[08:36] <raqball> I think it 586 version
[08:36] <rich_> right now im at a fast 50hz
[08:36] <morgue> JDStone, thx
[08:36] <JDStone> ask in here, sorry, but I have to go
[08:36] <JDStone> morgue: np
[08:37] <spawn> thanks ubotu
[08:37] <RasmusseN> at 41% on my ubuntu 6.10 download :-D
[08:37] <Sixer> Isn't there a Universe package for mplayer?
[08:37] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: 70% :p
[08:37] <rich_> anyone?
[08:37] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: how much time do you have left?
[08:37] <Cmcrae> does anyone know about setting up the sound on ubunto
[08:38] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: 4 and a half minutes
[08:38] <morgue> RasmusseN, I'm on terminal but I get nothing besides morgue@morgue-laptop:~$
[08:38] <ashzilla> Is there any reason to keep outdated linux-images and linux-headers?
[08:38] <raqball> have you tried alsamixer in terminal?
[08:38] <Ratzilla> morgue: open firefox and go to the link
[08:38] <Ratzilla> morgue: and when firefox just closes, there will be an error message in the terminal
[08:38] <soundray> ashzilla: not really. I regularly purge all except the latest two.
[08:38] <morgue> Ratzilla, I did, firefox closes but I don't see anything on the console
[08:38] <Ratzilla> press enter
[08:38] <Ratzilla> in the terminal
[08:38] <Thib_> soundray: there are no such dpkg files. The acpi-support file has ACPI_SLEEP=true, ACPI_HIBERNATE=true and ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=mem
[08:39] <furesta> Hi all, I have a problem with the update-manager after upgrading to edgy, it gives the following message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29589/ , and it shows the available upgrades, but it doesn't upgrade anything! And I can also run it along with synaptic with no warning, strange, huh? Any ideas?
[08:39] <ashzilla> soundray: sounds good. Will a complete removal via Synpatic be the same as a purge with apt-get?
[08:39] <Thib_> soundray: (among other settings). Wouldn't that work, then?
[08:39] <morgue> Ratzilla, do i have to open firefox from the terminal?
[08:39] <Ratzilla> morgue: yes
[08:39] <RasmusseN> I'll be getting a new system pretty soon should I have any problems with the 975X chipset? X1900XT?
[08:39] <morgue> Ratzilla, ok sorry then, how do i do that? :)
[08:39] <Ratzilla> morgue: type firefox in the terminal
[08:39] <soundray> Thib_: how about HIBERNATE_MODE?
[08:40] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: I am 50%
[08:40] <morgue> got it
[08:40] <morgue> Ok here's what I get:
[08:40] <morgue> The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
[08:40] <morgue> This probably reflects a bug in the program.
[08:40] <morgue> The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
[08:40] <morgue>   (Details: serial 118 error_code 8 request_code 146 minor_code 3)
[08:40] <morgue>   (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
[08:40] <morgue>    that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
[08:40] <morgue>    To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
[08:40] <looksaus> is it possible to install edgy on a machine with an internet connection and only the Dapper CD
[08:40] <morgue>    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
[08:40] <morgue>    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
[08:41] <cynical> looksaus: yes, just run "gksu update-manager -c"
[08:41] <cuu508> hi, is it possible to get lilo installed on a clean edgy? grub doesn't work for my old SATA, lilo does, but I can't figure out how to set it up from livecd (got debs from 5.06 CD)
[08:41] <Thib_> soundray: there is no HIBERNATE_MODE setting that I can find from grep'ping.
[08:41] <RasmusseN> morgue: The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error?
[08:41] <looksaus> cynical: I would like to make a virgin edgy install
[08:41] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: im on a university connection lol so its going at 650kb/s and theere isnt that many ATI drivers out there so i think you gotta google around to see if people have been able to run that graphics card properly on ubuntu..
[08:41] <morgue> RasmusseN, I have no idea, I'm a noob :)
[08:41] <Thib_> soundray: oops, sorry, I misspelled the grep string
[08:41] <cynical> looksaus: thats not possible without the edgy cd :\
[08:42] <Thib_> soundray: HIBERNATE_MODE=shutdown
[08:42] <encarni> hola
[08:42] <RasmusseN> morgue: I am at linux too...
[08:42] <soundray> Thib_: try changing that to platform
[08:42] <encarni> heloow
[08:42] <blind> I had my webcam running in `webcam` and i killed it, and went to use it in something else, and it said there was nothing there. so unplug/replug, the light on it isn't coming on, and the computer doesn't see it... wtf?
[08:42] <morgue> Raskall, any clue of what's happening?
[08:42] <rod__> does edgy come with a grapical tool to mount drives which are not in fstab?
[08:43] <looksaus> cynical, unless you play some very exciting bootstrapping game maybe
[08:43] <cynical> rod__: do you mean like usb drives? they are mounted automatically
[08:43] <RasmusseN> If i get ubuntu installed will it be hard to put xgl on it?
[08:43] <Ratzilla> morgue: did you upgrade distro or anythign recently?
[08:43] <VitoGirl> just installed kubuntu 6.06.1 and trying to install tcl8.4 and i got these problems : checking for gcc no , checking for cc no ,checking compression for manpages no,checking whether to use sumlinks for manpages no any help please
[08:43] <rod__> cycom, its actually sda1
[08:43] <NetVamp> How can I have a partition auto mount on startup? fstab doesn't seem to have worked, the mountpoint doesnt exist, a double click on the partition says only root can mount it. I guess it doesn't auto mount if I log in with a regular non-root user, right? Any way to change that? And second question, is there a way to auto login on startup?
[08:44] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: xgl has easy instructions to follow for installation in the ubuntu wiki
[08:44] <morgue> Ratzilla, yeah, last night upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10
[08:44] <dv_> does anyone here actually have beryl and the beta nvidia drivers running?
[08:44] <gouki> RasmusseN - No. There are literally, hundreds of step-by-step guides on how to install Compiz
[08:44] <rod__> cynical, i think at install moment i didnt select it to be mounted as anything
[08:44] <morgue> Ratzilla, but it was crasing even before that
[08:44] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: Nice
[08:44] <cynical> looksaus: I mean I know it can be done, but if you are asking on irc then it would be very hard for you
[08:44] <RasmusseN> gouki: wha tis compiz
[08:44] <Ratzilla> morgue: via apt-get or aptitude?
[08:44] <furesta> Hi all, I have a problem with the update-manager after upgrading to edgy, it gives the following message when running from terminal: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29589/ , and it shows the available upgrades, but it doesn't upgrade anything! And I can also run it along with synaptic with no warning, strange, huh? Any ideas?
[08:44] <ryjax> i'm curious, anyone ever put ubuntu on an xbox?
[08:44] <looksaus> cynical: dont underestimate my knowledge
[08:44] <gouki> RasmusseN - Compiz is (was) XGL
[08:45] <soundray> blind: sounds like a broken webcam
[08:45] <xamox> what firewall does everyone suggest using for ubuntu?
[08:45] <cuu508> hi, is it possible to get lilo installed on a clean edgy? grub doesn't work for my old SATA, lilo does, but I can't figure out how to set it up from livecd (got debs from 5.04 CD)
[08:45] <blind> soundray: it's not broken, it was just working.
[08:45] <cynical> gouki: no its not, compiz is a compositing manager
[08:45] <theo_> PSUSI: mate in step 1 here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575 and line 5 I got this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29591/
[08:45] <morgue> Ratzilla,  I used gksu "update-manager -c"
[08:45] <looksaus> I have done similar things the hard way before
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> xamox, iptables, set up with firestarter
[08:45] <cynical> looksaus: I'm just saying, it wouldnt be easy
[08:45] <VitoGirl> just installed kubuntu 6.06.1 and trying to install tcl8.4 and i got these problems : checking for gcc no , checking for cc no ,checking compression for manpages no,checking whether to use sumlinks for manpages no any help please
[08:45] <coz_> Amaranth, i see the numbers hae not reduced!
[08:45] <RasmusseN> gouki: o okay, sorry I am a linux n00b.
=== arrai is now known as Arrai
[08:45] <chad> is there a partition app in ubuntu? i dont seem to find one... wanted somthing similar to partitionmagic..etc
[08:45] <looksaus> but I wondered if there would be an easier way..
[08:45] <zugu> hi guys
[08:45] <xamox> nolimitsoya:  is firestart console based?
[08:45] <cuu508> chad - gparted
[08:45] <Admiral_Chicago> !lilo > cuu508
[08:45] <soundray> blind: plugged direct into computer or into a hub?
[08:45] <looksaus> cynical: thx anyway for your help
[08:45] <cynical> chad: install gparted
[08:45] <chad> kk
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> VitoGirl, apt-get install build-essential
[08:45] <blind> soundray: tried both :\
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> xamox, no, its gtk
[08:46] <dommie> can gparted resize partitions without destroying the data?
[08:46] <theo_> PSUSI: keep always in mind that all I want is to "simply" run World of Warcraft using crossover standard beta in my 64 bit Ubuntu installation
[08:46] <Ratzilla> morgue: updating distro versions usually gives unstability..i'd recommend a clean install of edgy...
[08:46] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: your jealous of my cable internet 3mmbps/256kbps
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> dommie, yes
[08:46] <cynical> dommie: yes, but theres always a chance
[08:46] <xamox> nolimitsoya:  iptables is CLI, correct?
[08:46] <soundray> blind: does it show up with lsusb?
=== Arrai is now known as arrai
[08:46] <blind> soundray: lsusb hangs.
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> xamox, firestarter is a gtk frontend
[08:46] <zugu> i'm on the live cd right now, how do I mount my /dev/hda1 partition? It's ext3
[08:46] <scifix> how would one go about parsing html, to extract the dvd ratings for every title reviewed?
[08:46] <dommie> any other OSS partitioning tools for doing so?
[08:46] <coz_> dafart, I like the nic
[08:46] <rod__> cynical, i think at install moment i didnt select it to be mounted as anything
[08:46] <morgue> Ratzilla, firefox was crashing even before that, I don't think that had to do with it
[08:46] <cynical> rod__: oh you mean your windows partition?
[08:46] <xamox> nolimitsoya:  Yeah, gotcha and iptables is Command Line Interface (CLI)?
[08:46] <soundray> blind: your USB hardware is hanging. Try a cold reboot.
[08:46] <RasmusseN> morgue: did it crash on the previous version of firefox?
[08:47] <Flats> I setup Samba and nwo I downloaede SWAT and installed it. Whaen I try to bring up the http://localhost:901. I get a Forbidden message and chek your hosts allow and hosts deny options. My hosts allow = 127. 192.168.0. Is something there wrong?
[08:47] <blind> soundray: it'll have to wait... lmao
[08:47] <rod__> cynical, no that one is mounted properly hehe... I mean an ext2 drive with data
[08:47] <poquedoraqu> Hey everyone... im completely new to Ubuntu and im having issues installing it. I have kind of a complicated setup :/
[08:47] <morgue> RasmusseN, I just realized it's crashing on every site that has flash :o
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> xamox, you never have to worry about that, but yes, iptables would normaly be set upmanualy through textfile editing
[08:47] <furesta> Hi all, I have a problem with the update-manager after upgrading to edgy, it gives the following message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29589/ , and it shows the available upgrades, but it doesn't upgrade anything! And I can also run it along with synaptic with no warning, strange, huh? Any ideas?
[08:47] <zugu> poquedoraqu: please describe your problem
[08:47] <RasmusseN> must be a problem with flash i guess than
[08:47] <cynical> rod__: I don't believe there is a graphical tool for it, but its pretty easy to do in fstab
[08:47] <morgue> how do i uninstall it? so i can install it again
[08:47] <xamox> nolimitsoya:  Well the firewall will be running on ubuntu server, so I need it to be command line.
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> !iptables > xamox
[08:48] <morgue> that might solve the problem
[08:48] <poquedoraqu> I have an external harddrive which i can successfully install ubuntu to, no problem. My internal HD already has winxp on it, and i can dual boot. the problem comes in the way I partition....
[08:48] <cynical> rod__: it would just be some thing like "/dev/hda1  /mnt/drive  ext2  defaults"
[08:48] <RasmusseN> morgue: I don't know about for linux
[08:48] <xamox> nolimitsoya:  awesome, thx!
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> np
[08:49] <cynical> rod__: and then you can type "sudo umount -a" and "sudo mount -a" to mount it without rebooting
[08:49] <scifix> how would one go about parsing html, to extract the dvd ratings for every title reviewed?
[08:49] <RasmusseN> can anyone tell morgue how to unistall firefox 2.0?
[08:49] <zugu> how can I mount my /dev/hda1 partition? I'm on the livecd right now
[08:49] <poquedoraqu> I partitioned linux in a 10gig ext3 but left 115 gigs in a fat32 so that both windows and linux can access it
[08:49] <poquedoraqu> but i cant make links on my linux desktop to anything in the FAT32 area, which is problematic
[08:49] <rich_> ok this is very frustrating I have in my xorg.conf under the monitor section my specifications for refresh rates and i am still at 1600X1200 50hz  Can anyone gimme a hand with this?
[08:49] <RasmusseN> poquedoraqu: you should use NFTS for windows
[08:49] <soundray> !fat32 | poquedoraqu
[08:49] <ubotu> poquedoraqu: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[08:49] <X5-452> I'm mounting a TrueCrypt unit in /mnt, but there since I'm not the owner I can't create files withouth using "sudo". And I can't change the owner with chown neither. Does anybody know what could I do?
[08:50] <cynical> zugu: mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows
[08:50] <Sixer> where do I start installing fbdev in ubuntu 6.10 desktop?
[08:50] <chad> now.. to add new partition to home
[08:50] <zugu> cynical: it's a ubuntu partition
[08:50] <cynical> zugu: of course typing "sudo mkdir /mnt/windows" before hand
[08:50] <Ratzilla> if you want to write to windows partitions while in ubuntu, you'll have to use fat32 for windows
[08:50] <soundray> RasmusseN: no, not if he wants to share between Windows and Linux (poquedoraqu)
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> X5-452, chown -r
[08:50] <cuu508> hi, is it possible to get lilo installed on a clean edgy? grub doesn't work for my old SATA, lilo does, but I can't figure out how to set it up from livecd (got debs from 5.04 CD)
[08:50] <cynical> zugu: ah, what filesystem?
[08:50] <dv_> Ratzilla, what about ntfs-3g?
[08:50] <zugu> cynical: the default filesystem ubuntu creates when installing
[08:50] <poquedoraqu> Right i want them to access the same files
[08:50] <Flats> How do I staop and start samba?
[08:51] <Flats> err stop and start
[08:51] <zugu> cynical: it's the /home partition of my previous dapper install
[08:51] <cynical> zugu: ok then, mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubuntu
[08:51] <morgue> let me try with synaptic
[08:51] <Ratzilla> dv_: never used it before o.O
[08:51] <zugu> cynical: thank you
[08:51] <cynical> zugu: sure, are you installing over it or something?
[08:51] <poquedoraqu> So its correct to set up my external HD with 10 gig for linux, 500 meg swap, 115 gig fat32 free space?
[08:51] <dv_> Ratzilla, http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=23836054&forum_id=2697
[08:52] <cynical> zugu: if so you dont even have to mount it you can just specify the mount point in the installer
[08:52] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: can't you use a program like partition magic? to create the partion than install linux witht he partion you've made?
[08:52] <zugu> cynical: I want to preserve some of my files, but not the congig files
[08:52] <cynical> zugu: ah ok :D
[08:52] <zugu> *config
[08:52] <poquedoraqu> Partitioning is easy, i do that from my boot cd
[08:52] <morgue> everything that has flash is crashing now :(
[08:52] <LjL> RasmusseN, Ratzilla: what's wrong with using GParted that's on the Ubuntu CD?
[08:52] <reddragon3668> how can I stop alsa manually? also, is there a file that tells whick modules to load in what order?
[08:52] <poquedoraqu> right
[08:52] <acidt> any1 knows solution to E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[08:52] <cynical> morgue: you need to reinstall flash?
[08:52] <X5-452> nolimitsoya, it get this error: "chown: changing ownership of `/mnt/new/': Operation not permitted"
[08:52] <soundray> poquedoraqu: sounds okay to me.
[08:52] <poquedoraqu> i just dont get why i cant make shortcuts to thing s in Fat32... it says "error - wrong file system"
[08:53] <znejk> Helo
[08:53] <morgue> cynical, how do i remove it first?
[08:53] <Flats> I setup Samba and nwo I downloaede SWAT and installed it. Whaen I try to bring up the http://localhost:901. I get a Forbidden message and chek your hosts allow and hosts deny options. My hosts allow = 127. 192.168.0. Is something there wrong?
[08:53] <X5-452> and I'm using sudo..
[08:53] <poquedoraqu> All i want is links on my desktop the same way youd do them in windows, giving you quick access to frequently used files
[08:53] <azureal> X5-452, maybe fstab doesnt like you =P
[08:53] <X5-452> he hates me, sure
[08:53] <cynical> morgue: sudo rm /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[08:53] <soundray> poquedoraqu: Linux-style softlinks aren't supported in fat. You could make the partition ext3 and install a ext2 filesystem driver for Windows.
[08:53] <X5-452> i'll take a look
[08:53] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: using linux to partition your drives will save you hours, it literally takes minutes for linux to partition your drives when you're installing
[08:53] <azureal> /mnt/new appears in fstab?
[08:54] <X5-452> it's a TrueCrypt unit, should I add it manually?
[08:54] <poquedoraqu> Oh they have those?
[08:54] <poquedoraqu> You can make windows read ext3?
[08:54] <azureal> idk, that's beyond me
[08:54] <morgue> cynical, morgue@morgue-laptop:~$ sudo rm /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[08:54] <morgue> rm: cannot remove `/usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so': No such file or directory
[08:54] <LjL> poquedoraqu: yes you can
[08:54] <cynical> morgue: do you have firefox installed in a non standard directory?
[08:54] <poquedoraqu> Wow that would be great! then i could have linux on one giant patrition
[08:54] <azureal> i'm curious why people recommend dist-upgrade over upgrade
[08:55] <jrib> !ext3 | poquedoraqu
[08:55] <cynical> morgue: like /opt?
[08:55] <ubotu> poquedoraqu: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[08:55] <poquedoraqu> that solves everything!
[08:55] <LjL> jrib: is that factoid new?
[08:55] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: I can keep my Windows Partion NFTS though right? than Linux will be FAT32?
[08:55] <poquedoraqu> thanks :D
[08:55] <jrib> LjL: not too recent, been there for a ocuple of weeks at least
[08:55] <znejk> anyone got a tip howto install ubuntu on a laptop withoit cd or floppy
[08:55] <morgue> cynical, I don't think so, how can I check?
[08:55] <LjL> RasmusseN: linux certainly should *not* be installed on a fAT32 partition
[08:55] <LjL> jrib: well, never hit it. good to know
[08:55] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: uh...you'd probably want to use reiserfs for linux
[08:55] <soundray> poquedoraqu: I would still recommend separate data and system partitions
[08:55] <cynical> morgue: type "locate firefox" and see what directories its installed in
[08:56] <soundray> poquedoraqu: you can have your /home on the data partition
[08:56] <LjL> RasmusseN: or ext3, which is the default choice in Ubuntu anyway
[08:56] <perforator> Hello, I hear the input from my microphone in my headphone (soundcard: SB live 5.1). Whats the problem?
[08:56] <azureal> cynical, locate?  why not just whereis?
[08:56] <poquedoraqu> how does /home work
[08:56] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: What is reiserfs and ext3?
[08:56] <LjL> perforator: ... that you have the microphone passthru-switch enabled in your mixer?
[08:56] <chad> im trying to add a new partition to my /home:
[08:56] <chad> cp: cannot overwrite non-directory `/dev/sda8' with directory `/home/'
[08:56] <chad> chad@nix-box:~$ sudo cp -Rp /home  /dev/sda8
[08:56] <cynical> azureal: that works too
[08:56] <Lars_G> herp
[08:56] <Lars_G> herp
[08:56] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: different file systems, you dont want ot use FAT32 for linux...
[08:56] <LjL> RasmusseN: they're two filesystems that are often used with Linux
[08:56] <chad> what gives?
[08:56] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell chad about paste
[08:57] <soundray> perforator: that's normal. Mute the microphone in alsamixer.
[08:57] <LjL> Lars_G: sorry?
[08:57] <Ratzilla> chad: you have to use sudo or su
[08:57] <Lars_G> is therr no mirrorselect-apt shet (yet) for ubuntu that uses ubuntu mirrorlists and distro names?
[08:57] <cynical> azureal: and displays more relevant output, lol thanks for the tip
[08:57] <chad> i did
[08:57] <azureal> cynical, np, always go for the simple + concise =)
[08:57] <LjL> Lars_G: i haven't understood what you said
[08:57] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla, LjL: what fiel system should i use than?
[08:57] <RasmusseN> file*
[08:57] <TeemuR> i'm using dapper how can i update my firefox 1.5.7 to 2.0?
[08:57] <LjL> RasmusseN: i suggest ext3, since it's robust and the Ubuntu default.
[08:58] <Lars_G> LjL: mirrorselect-apt last time I tried still used debian mirrorlists and distro names. is there no ubuntu version yet?
[08:58] <cynical> morgue: did you install it from the repository?
[08:58] <morgue> cynical, I do get /opt/firefox/ also /usr/lib/firefox/c
[08:58] <chad> i used:  sudo cp -Rp /home/ /dev/sda8
[08:58] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: ext3 is good, i personally like ReiserFS
[08:58] <poquedoraqu> Problem with having a seperate data partition: I cant INSTALL to it can i?
[08:58] <Ratzilla> chad: what are you trying ot do? copy your home directory to a different disk?
[08:58] <poquedoraqu> linux auto-installs to its own drive
[08:58] <cynical> morgue: ok then you want this command, sudo rm /opt/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[08:58] <Lars_G> Linux knows directories, not drives
[08:58] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: whats the difference between the two?
[08:58] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[08:59] <chad> yes.. that or just add a new partition to /home if that is possible
[08:59] <soundray> poquedoraqu: why would you want to install to a data partition?
[08:59] <poquedoraqu> because i might run out of space on linux's own?
[08:59] <poquedoraqu> or should i give it more than 10gigs then
[08:59] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: whoops my install is ready
[08:59] <Sixer> is vesafb enabled/supported/ready by default in Ubuntu desktop?
[08:59] <LjL> RasmusseN: ext3 is a journalled extension of ext2, an older filesystem. RaiserFS is a journalled filesystem made from scratch.
[08:59] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: well done downloading
[08:59] <Ratzilla> chad: then you have to mount the disk to your home directory
[08:59] <morgue> cynical, morgue@morgue-laptop:~$ sudo rm /opt/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[08:59] <morgue> rm: cannot remove `/opt/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so': No such file or directory
[08:59] <chad> ./home is low on diskspace :P
[09:00] <morgue> the directory is there but there's no libflashplayer
[09:00] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: i dont have a cd to burn it on to to install edgy :( so i gotta wait till i get home
[09:00] <perforator> k it was called AC97 in alsamixer
[09:00] <chad> ok so just mount it to /home?
[09:00] <ashzilla> How can I reinstall the file default file that comes with Ubuntu .bashrc
[09:00] <cynical> morgue: hmm, its almost as if you dont have it installed :P
[09:00] <LjL> Lars_G: apparently still debian only
[09:00] <soundray> poquedoraqu: it'll be a while until you run out of space on 10GB. Do you know how to mount a data partition in ubuntu?
[09:00] <Lars_G> LjL: sigh, thanks anyhow.
[09:00] <Ratzilla> morgue: no / at the beginning
[09:00] <Lars_G> thanks for testing LjL
[09:00] <azureal> does anyone know why a dist-upgrade would cause weird glibc (at least it seems it is glibc) errors when starting xterm?
[09:00] <RasmusseN> LjL: so which one should I use?
[09:00] <cynical> morgue: follow this to install flash player 9, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=284725
[09:00] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: use ext3, thats linux default
[09:00] <poquedoraqu> Not exactly :/
[09:01] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: Sucks for you :-P lol i'll probbaly run into problems installing ubuntu on my system now
[09:01] <LjL> RasmusseN, are we running in circles? i suggested ext3. ReiserFS is another choice that other people prefer.
[09:01] <azureal> I feel like i shouldve done an 'upgrade' rather than 'dist-upgrade' and now not sure how to fix this glibc prob
[09:01] <Lars_G> azureal: possibly because you haven't upgraded xterm yet and it's compiled against the older glibc
[09:01] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: reiserfs is supposed to be better with small files under a few kilobytes but ext3 is still good
[09:01] <spawn> Can I install the fglrx driver i have an ATI Radeon M22 [Mobility M300] ?
[09:01] <morgue> cynical, ok brb
[09:01] <RasmusseN> LjL: well you said ext3 while Ratzilla said reiserfs
[09:01] <Lars_G> azureal: If you did an upgrade before dist-upgrade LOTS more stuff would be broken
[09:01] <LjL> azureal: what did you do?
[09:02] <LjL> RasmusseN: well, must there be only one choice?
[09:02] <pcube_> can any one tell me how to install kde alongside gnome
[09:02] <LjL> RasmusseN: i'd use ext3. your mileage may vary. if you're unsure, use the defaults.
[09:02] <RasmusseN> LjL: yes, when i don't know shit about linux really
[09:02] <chad> i see how i should mount ntfs drives in the guide..but im not sure how to mount ext3 partitions to /home
[09:02] <AlanHaggai> same here pcube_ someone help
[09:02] <[GuS] > pcube_, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:02] <poquedoraqu> Okay so if i make 10gigs of ext3 for linux, 500 megs for swap, and then let the rest of the external be a seperate data partition ALSO in ext3, leave windows on NFTS and install the driver on windows to view ext3... that shoudl do it? Or am i missing something
[09:02] <RasmusseN> LjL: I will just use the defualt than
[09:02] <SwoOp> how can i boot live cd without X?
[09:02] <AlanHaggai> [GuS]  will that remove Gnome?
[09:02] <azureal> LjL and Lars_G, well some time ago I did an aptitude update and aptitude dist-upgrade
[09:02] <Ratzilla> chad: try sudo mount /dev/sda8/ /home ?
[09:03] <[GuS] > no AlanHaggai will not
[09:03] <AlanHaggai> thanks [GuS]  :)
[09:03] <LjL> azureal: dapper->edgy, or what?
[09:03] <palm76> pcube:i would suggest to use aptitude,its better at handling dependencies.sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop.
[09:03] <pcube_> will it replace the original gnome desktop?
[09:03] <soundray> poquedoraqu: no. Just make sure that you give /home as the mount point for the data partition during the installation.
[09:03] <RasmusseN> how much space will ubuntu 6.10 be after install?
[09:03] <[GuS] > then by GDM or KDM you wil available to choose session... KDE or Gnome
[09:03] <cynical> pcube_: sudo apt-get install kde
[09:03] <spawn> Can anyone help me.. I want my tv-out to work I have an ATI Radeon M22 [Mobility M300] ? I found an fglrx drive can I use that one?
[09:03] <[GuS] > cynical, thast not the right way.
[09:03] <poquedoraqu> oh!
[09:03] <azureal> LjL, yep, dapper -> edgy.. and omg... aptitude upgrade right now wants me to remove mplayer..
[09:03] <[GuS] > is kubuntu-desktop
[09:03] <cynical> [GuS] : yes, it is
[09:03] <[GuS] > no.
[09:04] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell azureal about upgrade
[09:04] <chad> mount: special device /dev/sda8/ does not exist       (a path prefix is not a directory)   ..is what i get then
[09:04] <morgue> cynical, I get You don't have the right permissions to extract archives in the folder "/opt/firefox/plugins"
[09:04] <LjL> azureal: you should have followed that instead
[09:04] <[GuS] > is why kubuntu-desktop virtual package exist
[09:04] <AlanHaggai> cynical : it is sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:04] <cynical> morgue: use sudo
[09:04] <poquedoraqu> Well thats all i need. thanks so much guys!
[09:04] <soundray> spawn: yes, but follow the ubuntu-specific instructions:
[09:04] <azureal> LjL, no.
[09:04] <cynical> AlanHaggai: if you want to use the splash screen as well
[09:04] <soundray> !ati | spawn
[09:04] <[GuS] > so, is not kde... is kubuntu-desktop
[09:04] <ubotu> spawn: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:04] <[GuS] > read the wiki first...
[09:04] <AlanHaggai> yes
[09:04] <[GuS] > or docs.. or whatever...
[09:04] <morgue> cynical, I wasn't doing it via the terminal, what's the command to copy?
[09:04] <azureal> LjL, you're making assumptions about what i installed =)
[09:04] <spawn> thanks soundray Im reading it right now But I wanted to make sure
[09:04] <LjL> azureal: that is?
[09:04] <cynical> [GuS] : if you just want to use the KDE environment you dont need to install kubuntu-desktop...
[09:04] <RasmusseN> LgL, Ratzilla: I am going to have to delete a ripped DVD from my computer :( to install linux is better fucking work!!
[09:04] <ashzilla> Friends of #ubuntu - How can I reinstall JUST one file of a package - for instance .bashrc
[09:04] <azureal> LjL, the server edition.
[09:04] <LjL> !language
[09:04] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[09:05] <[GuS] > cynical, kubuntu-desktop will install default KDE apps
[09:05] <azureal> LjL, so no ubuntu-desktop packages.
[09:05] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: lol, just bur the dvd first?
[09:05] <cynical> morgue: type sudo cp /home/username/Desktop/libflashplayer.so /opt/firefox/plugins
[09:05] <dcraven> ashzilla, there is a fresh one in /etc/skel/
=== freebsd_fan is now known as [a] freebsd_fan
[09:05] <LjL> ashzilla: .deb files are really just ar archives, you can extract them with the "ar" command. they contain to tar.gz archives, which you can extract with "tar xf"
[09:05] <palm76> ashzilla:isn't automatically created whe you fire up bash?
[09:05] <Ratzilla> RasmusseN: i actually have some dvds on me so im gonna burn edgy onto a dvd and then install edgy :)
[09:05] <LjL> azureal: i see, do you have any third party repositories enabled?
[09:06] <cynical> [GuS] : /shrug, you get kde both ways
[09:06] <RasmusseN> Ratzilla: I can't my DVD burner is giving me attitude. I am going to have to take it out to a field and beat it with a baseball bat.
[09:06] <[GuS] > nope... i am afraid not... kubuntu-desktop is the best way to do it...
[09:06] <RasmusseN> LjL: sorry, for my cursing
[09:06] <[GuS] > because you will have necesary and default packages.
[09:06] <cynical> [GuS] : so you dont get kde if you install kde?
[09:06] <chad> Ratzilla: that command didnt work.. mount: special device /dev/sda8/ does not exist       (a path prefix is not a directory)   ..is what i get then
[09:06] <morgue> cynical, just did, the file is there now, still crashes :@
[09:06] <Moodles`> is libATA part of the kernel, or can you update it without having to download new kernel?
[09:06] <cynical> morgue: what happens exactly?
[09:06] <[GuS] > cynical, you you get... but kubuntu-desktop is for that...
[09:06] <LjL> chad: /dev/sda8
[09:07] <palm76> cynical:if you install kdebase you get a basic kde
[09:07] <[GuS] > so please read before repeat this to me :)
[09:07] <cynical> palm76: I know this
[09:07] <morgue> I open flash, I go to say youtube.com it closes
[09:07] <azureal> LjL, yes, one, but that is only supposed to be for codecs
[09:07] <cynical> morgue: Do other flash sites crash? like videos.google.com?
[09:07] <acidt> does anybody know solution to this :P http://wklej.org/id/b1b80cafb8
[09:07] <[GuS] > so, people under Gnome wants to install KDE, type sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop... and people under KDE wants to install Gnome... sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[09:07] <LjL> azureal: which repository is it anyway? and anyway, what point in the dist-upgrade process are you at?
[09:08] <morgue> cynical, yep
[09:08] <cynical> [GuS] : well not everyone who wants to try out kde wants their ubuntu splash screen changed to a kubuntu one
[09:08] <palm76> moodles:libata is a part of the kernel. and gets updated when the kernel gets updated ig there's an update for it.
[09:08] <[GuS] > cycom, that does not do that
[09:08] <rich_> *
[09:08] <[GuS] > cynical, *
[09:08] <Ratzilla> edgy done :) install time
[09:08] <chad> ok..worked.. new partiton is mounted in /home.. gonna try cp now
[09:08] <cynical> morgue: You are using firefox 2.0?
[09:09] <morgue> cynical, yes
[09:09] <[GuS] > when you install kubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-desktop will ask you even which session manager to use
[09:09] <[GuS] > GDM or KDM
[09:09] <cynical> morgue: in dapper or edgy?
[09:09] <Moodles`> im using Edgy, and I worked out I need a newer libata so hdparm stops reporting SATA harddrives as standby where they are infact active
[09:09] <LjL> acidt: the module you're trying to install appears to be for kernel 2.6.18, but i believe if you have edgy your kernel is 2.6.17
[09:09] <azureal> LjL, it can be seen here http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/dists/edgy-seveas/all/  , and i'm done upgrading, for i've been on edgy for a while now
[09:09] <morgue> 6.10 == dapper?
[09:09] <Moodles`> how old is the Edgy kernel?
[09:09] <cynical> morgue: 6.10 = edgy
[09:09] <Moodles`> 6.06 is dapper
[09:09] <Moodles`> 6.10 is Edghy
[09:09] <morgue> ok edgy then :)
[09:09] <acidt> LjL:  i have 2.6.18.1
[09:09] <rich_> ok my third or fourth time asking....i have refresh rate issues and my only options are 50 and 63 hz....i have my refresh rates specified under the section monitor and I have also done a dpkg -reconfigure and get same results
[09:09] <cynical> morgue: so do "sudo apt-get install firefox" in your terminal
[09:09] <azureal> LjL, so like i said, it doesnt really matter, it was only for codecs
[09:10] <LjL> azureal: yes, it should be safe enough. care to pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
[09:10] <morgue> $ sudo apt-get install firefox

[09:10] <soundray> rich_: it's not quite clear what the problem is.
[09:10] <cynical> morgue: wait you have two versions of firefox installed?
[09:11] <alek> hi
[09:11] <cynical> morgue: did you install from source or use automatix?
[09:11] <azureal> LjL, er, i guess i could, but i think there should just be a way to fix glibc...
[09:11] <cynical> morgue: bleh I mean a guide
[09:11] <soundray> jerp: install sun-java5-jre

[09:12] <webmaren> trying to get ndiswrapper to work
[09:12] <LjL> ashzilla, why'd you want to do that anyway?
[09:12] <soundray> rich_: so you specify those in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then what?
[09:12] <rich_> i have them specified in xorg.conf under the monitor section but its like xserver isn't allowing me to change
[09:12] <webmaren> get some error messages when I try to make

[09:13] <soundray> rich_: have you got X running right now?
[09:13] <LjL> alecjw: or just "sudo apt-get --reinstall install packagename" (or "sudo aptitude reinstall packagename")
[09:13] <rich_> yes i do
[09:13] <mdke> is there any way to get back the old startup/logout sounds? These Edgy ones suck
[09:13] <RasmusseN> time to install ubuntu bbl hopefully it works without errors
[09:13] <LjL> ashzilla, if your .bashrc is messed up, just restore it from /etc/skel/.bashrc

[09:13] <webmaren> i can't make ndiswrapper
[09:13] <soundray> rich_: to make your changes happen, you have to restart X, e.g. with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
[09:13] <rich_> when it should at least be 75
[09:13] <alecjw> LjL: is there a command to reinstall every single package?
[09:13] <rich_> i have done that serveral times ;)
[09:14] <alek> LjL, i havent internet conncetion so where does he get the sources from?
[09:14] <LjL> alecjw: i don't think, though you could probably pipe the output of "dpkg --get-selections" to apt-get or aptitude
[09:14] <soundray> webmaren: you shouldn't have to
[09:14] <alek> o sory
[09:14] <morgue> cynical, what do you suggest?
[09:14] <azureal> LjL, when there's a glibc error, exactly which glibc is it referring to?
[09:14] <webmaren> soundray: i mean using "make"
[09:14] <cynical> morgue: remove the firefox in opt by typing the command sudo rm -rf /opt/firefox
[09:14] <soundray> webmaren: just install the ubuntu packages. No need to compile.
[09:15] <soundray> !ndiswrapper | webmaren

[09:15] <cynical> morgue: now sudo apt-get remove firefox, sudo apt-get install firefox
[09:15] <azureal> LjL, should i aptitude reinstall libglib?
[09:15] <LjL> azureal: well, pastebin the error as well. anyway, maybe not relevant to the problem at hand, but you have the Universe and Multiverse components enabled, but don't have them enabled in the edgy-updates and edgy-security repositories. that could create problems.
[09:15] <LjL> azureal: i dunno - paste the actual glibc error(s) you get
[09:15] <soundray> rich_: I think I understand now. You *want* 75Hz, but you only get choices of 50 and 63. Correct?
[09:16] <variant> wtf, apt-get install vmware-player and it is removing a ton of packages
[09:16] <cynical> morgue: then sudo cp /home/username/Desktop/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins

[09:17] <LjL> azureal: what program causes this error?
[09:17] <c0nf> Hi dudes!
[09:17] <cynical> variant: ubuntu-desktop is a meta package, meaning it is a package that just points to other packages. Its ok to remove it, it wont do anything to your system
[09:17] <notwist> I can't get no sound when i try to play back mms streams, any ideas why? i have the w32 codec pack for mplayer...
[09:17] <azureal> LjL, xterm, i just said =P
[09:17] <c0nf> Please suggest me some image scanning application!
[09:17] <soundray> rich_: have you specified both hsync and vertical refresh ranges in xorg.conf?
[09:17] <mztriz> How do I set up VNC so that when people connect it doesn't show up in 8 bit for them
[09:17] <rich_> soundray: yes i have
[09:18] <variant> cynical: i know that, but why is apt-get instal vmware-player removing it along with a bunch of other packages like gnome-sessoin etcetc
[09:18] <rich_> i got the specs from my manual

[09:19] <cynical> morgue: and does flash work?
[09:19] <morgue> cynical, how do i get the shortcuts now?
[09:19] <highneko_> soundray: Oh yea, forgot about that. Any other program?

[09:20] <mztriz> How do I set up VNC so that when people connect it doesn't show up in 8 bit for them
[09:20] <morgue> cynical, flash is not linux friendly man
[09:20] <legonio> variant: oh... and the rest can still be there?
[09:20] <morgue> cynical, thanks A LOT

[09:24] <speen> SwoOp, ge
[09:24] <baastrup> Hi, im having problems with slow boot, looks like fsck takes a lot of time, is there a solution on this??
[09:24] <LjL> azureal: well, just type "sudo aptitude install mplayer", that should make it shut up. anyway, i'm thinking that - since you haven't enabled edgy-updates and edgy-security for universe and multiverse - you might have some program from one of those components that hasn't been updated to some newer patch of glibc, and is making aptitude stick to an older glibc version, while xterm doesn't notice and crashes. kind of a convoluted hypothesis, but i'd
[09:24] <LjL> add universe and multiverse to edgy-security and edgy-updates, run a "sudo apt-get update", and a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" (or just upgrade, or whatever, or with aptitude)
[09:25] <speen> SwoOp, yeah. Everything freezes
[09:25] <morgue> I'll work on that later, thanks again
[09:25] <morgue> :)

[09:25] <rich_> yep
[09:25] <botxj> what's the name of the gnome file manager, the bin file, that is?
[09:25] <speen> SwoOp, could always try to download the alternate install cd.
[09:25] <azureal> LjL, wait up.. i compiled mplayer from source
[09:26] <g333k_work> dcraven, I have edited that fil, but gdm doesnt see the change, do you know why?
[09:26] <LjL> ryanakca: good
[09:26] <g333k_work> file*
[09:26] <SwoOp> speen<- i did
[09:26] <dcraven> g333k_work, /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom

[09:26] <azureal> LjL, and i already did add multiverse and universe, and updated

[09:26] <aum> hi - just installed edgy, the alt keys are disabled (standard 105-key PS/2 keyboard) - what gives?
[09:26] <LjL> azureal: ah well, then aptitude probably isn't realizing you wanted it. but still, i'd try the apt-get/aptitude install mplayer -- just make sure it's going to "install" your version (i.e. it says "i'm not going to touch it because it's already there") rather than get the one from the repos
[09:26] <azureal> LjL, oh, and aptitude dist-upgrade just wants me to remove mplayer
[09:27] <rich_> ill deal with this later i have some stuff i need to do around the house i guess ;)  thank you so much for your time soundray
[09:27] <rich_> much appreciated
[09:27] <ZirJoker> hi everybody
[09:27] <g333k_work> dcraven, also I run gdmsetup, modify a value and when I run it again there is the old value, so it is not saving the changes, why?
[09:27] <variant> botxj: fadasdf
[09:27] <soundray> rich_: hope you'll fix it in the end. Annoying, having good hardware and not being able to use it fully
[09:27] <dcraven> g333k_work, did you read the comments at the very top of /etc/gdm/gdm.conf?
[09:27] <azureal> LjL, no, api mplayer wants to upgrade one package and install 15 more =/
[09:27] <Thib_> soundray: okay I'm going to try powering the machine off. Well I mean, hibernating.
[09:28] <g333k_work> dcraven, I erased them
[09:28] <dcraven> g333k_work, nice work.

[09:30] <ZirJoker> Halpo don you have any panel left? even task list?

[09:30] <SwoOp> plz help,i cant boot ubuntu edgy live cd
[09:30] <ashzilla> what's the problem with VMware server not running after an upgrade to Edgy?
[09:30] <rocky|away> LjL: that's a pretty lame rule ... i change my nick to |away for the benefit of several other irc channels, not this one
[09:30] <SwoOp> anyone any idea?
[09:30] <Halpo> ZirJoker: nope, i can create a new launcher from the desktop and get to a terminal, but thats it
[09:31] <azureal> LjL, ok, i removed it, and now mplayer won't start, rofl
[09:31] <LjL> rocky|away: then stay in those channels.
[09:31] <ZirJoker> hmm let me investigate..
[09:31] <rocky|away> LjL: nice
[09:31] <LjL> azureal: ...removed?
[09:31] <soundray> Halpo: try running gnome-panel from the terminal
[09:32] <Thib_> soundray: it didn't work. The machine didn't go to sleep. I logged off and on in case the power management applet needed to read the new settings in the file, or something, but it didn't do it either.
[09:32] <ashzilla> what's the problem with VMware server not running after an upgrade to Edgy?
[09:32] <azureal> LjL, it's an interesting situation, really... if i aptitude remove mplayer, and then install the .deb that was created from checkinstall, then aptitude now wants me to remove mplayer because it is "unused"
[09:32] <gourdin> I got a lot a kept back package when I do a dist-upgrade on my edgy, is it normal ?
[09:32] <ZirJoker> yeah that can help XD
[09:32] <Halpo> cool, thanks
[09:32] <Thib_> should I have restarted the machine after changing /etc/default/acpi-support?
[09:32] <timur> Bonsoir a tous :)
[09:32] <SwoOp> speen<- i think i will reinstall 6.06
[09:33] <zircx> ok, I've got a problem that I don't quite know where to start looking for the source of the issue.. I'm using Edgy at the moment but my connection keeps having dns problems which continuously sends me to crappy freaked out sites, has anyone else had this problem?
[09:33] <azureal> LjL, is there some way to get aptitude to just forget about the package mplayer?
[09:33] <ZirJoker> soundtray do you know how can i get "LANGUAGE=en gimp" to work in my starter???
[09:33] <speen> SwoOp, and do a manual upgrade?
[09:33] <soundray> Thib_: no, it should read that file on every state change
[09:33] <dcraven> ashzilla, new kernel. Rerun vmware-configure or whatever that crap is.
[09:33] <dkr> azureal: pin the package to 0 in preferences?
[09:33] <Thib_> soundray: oh :-(
[09:34] <SwoOp> speen<- for now, 6.06 xD
[09:34] <Thib_> soundray: the only thing that appeared on the screen while it was trying to hibernate was something like "cannot find swap device, try swapon -a"
[09:34] <SwoOp> speen<- i will see in future ...xD
[09:34] <azureal> dkr, oh, i've never actually used 'aptitude', i've always just done its commandline options
[09:34] <Thib_> but I don't know what that would mean.
[09:34] <soundray> Thib_: sorry, your ACPI was clearly supported before and isn't now. I would have a look at the BIOS setup, but there is a good chance that hibernate won't work anymore
[09:34] <speen> SwoOp, hehe. Good luck. I'm trying to install from the alternate cd now.
[09:34] <soundray> Thib_: oops, you do need swap for hibernation obviously...
[09:34] <azureal> i think what i'm looking for is 'hold'
[09:34] <speen> SwoOp, See you around
[09:35] <dkr> azureal: man apt_preferences
[09:35] <dkr> azureal: ah, yeah, that would probably be easier
[09:35] <soundray> Thib_: do you have swap configured? (grep swap /etc/fstab)
[09:35] <SwoOp> speen<- googluck :P
[09:35] <Thib_> soundray: I don't understand, you mean that fewer and fewer computers are supported over time?
[09:35] <crass> I've modified my system, and now ubuntu doesn't boot into gdm, what could I have changed?
[09:35] <soundray> Thib_: no, that would be bad...

[09:35] <sentinel> hiho
[09:35] <sentinel> ok got no wlan on ubuntu 6.10

[09:36] <sentinel> aspire 5024 - any ideas?
[09:36] <Thib_> soundray: oh, my /etc/fstab file looks so weird
[09:36] <LjL> azureal: (by the way, the apt-get that's in edgy has an autoremove feature as well, and i've now switched to it from aptitude - not that aptitude's bad, just saying)
[09:36] <azureal> LjL, ok, hold worked out ok-- nothing happens at dist-upgrade, so everything is up-to-date
[09:36] <Thib_> soundray: it seems to have changed completely from what I used to know
[09:36] <duaneb> damn
[09:36] <duaneb> darn, sorry
[09:36] <soundray> Thib_: what I mean is that many ACPI implementations are buggy, and sometimes an update inadvertently makes the system incompatible with a particular bug
[09:37] <soundray> Thib_: what does the grep give you?
[09:37] <duaneb> I tried to configure fluxbox the way I like it, with imlib and transparency, right?
[09:37] <Thib_> it has a bunch of UUID stuff now...
[09:37] <azureal> LjL, ah, but i just didnt like apt-get from before, so it will take me some time to get over it
[09:37] <duaneb> but then it spits out this: configure: error: Your libstdc++ doesn't have the sstream or strstream classes
[09:37] <LjL> azureal: it isn't saying "N packages not upgraded" (with N!=0), is it?
[09:37] <soundray> Thib_: what does the grep give you?
[09:37] <azureal> LjL, well it is, just 1, for mplayer.

[09:38] <duaneb> anyone?
[09:38] <Thib_> soundray: I remember back when the format was what is now commented out; I wouldn't know how to set up the UUID thing myself if I was to add a hard drive (but let's not go there for now)
[09:38] <duaneb> ubuntu is a damn nightmare for me :|
[09:38] <Geoffrey2> I'm about to do a full install of Edgy, other than making sure all my data is backed up, anything I should be aware of before I start it up?
[09:38] <duaneb> gentoo was soo much easier!!!
[09:38] <dcraven> lol
[09:38] <soundray> Thib_: what does it say when you do a 'sudo swapon -a'|
[09:38] <soundray> ?
[09:39] <Thib_> with a pipe at the end?
[09:39] <Thib_> or was that a typo?
[09:39] <noela> i never thought i would live to read something like that, duaneb
[09:39] <noela> lol
[09:39] <LjL> azureal: i see. well i don't really know about the xterm thing, googling didn't help either. all i can suggest, which will almost certainly not work, is "aptitude reinstall xterm", and failing that, *POSSIBLY* "aptitude reinstall libc6", which might be dangerous however for what i know
[09:39] <Thib_> oh
[09:39] <crass> duaneb: look at the config.log
[09:39] <Thib_> it says
[09:39] <Thib_> "swapon: /dev/disk/by-uuid/7906fad1-a15b-443d-b713-f895280c34ad: Invalid argument"
[09:39] <soundray> Thib_: typo. Only what's inside the quotes
[09:39] <duaneb> noela, gentoo works soo well
[09:39] <duaneb> I have to struggle to compile something
[09:40] <dcraven> duaneb, I'd stick with it if I were you. That's what you are familiar with.
[09:40] <noela> it does, but it's not what you'd call an "easy-to-use" distro...
[09:40] <Thib_> (sorry, I'm a little freaked out by the new fstab syntax thingy)
[09:40] <soundray> Thib_: try replacing the UUID string with /dev/hda5 (assuming that that is still your swap partition)
[09:40] <crass> duaneb: yeah, thats one of the problems with binary distros, imo
[09:40] <Thib_> soundray: so, you mean, I should make fstab pretty much the same as what it used to be?
[09:41] <Vladaz> hello
[09:41] <Vladaz> has anyone tried to play world of warcraft on linux?

[09:41] <lotusleaf> Vladaz: #winehq
[09:41] <soundray> Thib_: no, only change the swap line (since everything else works)
[09:41] <Vladaz> ok thanks
[09:41] <lotusleaf> Vladaz: yw
[09:41] <Thib_> soundray: okay; I'll check with gparted that the partition name is still the right one
[09:42] <soundray> Thib_: you could also correct the UUID string based on looking at 'ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid'
[09:42] <azureal> LjL, why libc6 and not libglib
[09:42] <salim> hi, why does my Ubuntu 6.10 use more battery than my window$ os, the difference is about 1hr (compared to 2hrs in linux)
[09:43] <Thib_> soundray: the UUID is correct, but just a sec, I think GParted has some useful extra info
[09:43] <ZirJoker> how do i create a launcher with parameters like... LANGUAGE=en gimp?
[09:44] <Thib_> soundray: basically since upgrading, the only other thing that was bothering me was Firefox 2 apparently causing the memory to thrash abominably after a few hours of being open
[09:44] <Thib_> soundray: but it seems my swap partition is just hosed
[09:44] <salim> !battery
[09:44] <azureal> LjL, and if i were to reinstall it, should i exit X and just do it from commandline?
[09:44] <optimusprime> how do you remove a kernel.....I compiled it wrong....do I remove the .deb package?
[09:44] <soundray> salim: you may need to install and configure laptop-mode-tools
[09:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about battery - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:44] <duaneb> sorry
[09:44] <Thib_> soundray: GParted shows a "warning" sign next to it and says,
[09:44] <optimusprime> what's the command line for that....
[09:44] <duaneb> where can I install the regular dev tools?
[09:44] <duaneb> the complete set?
[09:44] <blazemonger> what'sup folks
[09:44] <duaneb> instead of JUST c tools or something random like that
[09:45] <mwright1> anyone know of ndiswrapper problems with wlan0
[09:45] <blazemonger> i am trying to compile source and one of my apps says it can't find gnome-config
[09:45] <soundray> Thib_: just set it up as swap space again
[09:45] <Thib_> "Unable to detect filesystem! Possible reasons are: the file system is damaged; the file system is unknown to GParted; there is no file system available (unformatted)"
[09:45] <mwright1> I can't do a iwlist but can't do a dhclient after doing iwconfig wlan0 essid and key
[09:45] <Thib_> soundray: yeah I think I need to do that
[09:45] <notwist> I can't get no sound when i try to play back mms streams, any ideas why? i have the w32 codec pack for mplayer...
[09:45] <mwright1> sorry I can do a iwlist... that works fine, but the other stuff doesn't
[09:45] <mwright1> I'm not stuffing up the key or the essid
[09:45] <azureal> duaneb, do you have linux headers for your
[09:46] <azureal> duaneb `uname -r`
[09:46] <duaneb> ok
[09:46] <duaneb> 2.6.17-10-generic
[09:46] <soundray> Thib_: hope that's the fix. Gotta go
[09:46] <blazemonger> what package is gnome-config in?
[09:46] <LjL> azureal: you mean glibc i suppose, not libglib... (which is the base for GTK)?  because i believe the libc6 package is the actual glibc package: type "apt-cache show libc6 | grep Provides"
[09:47] <LjL> azureal: and yeah, i'd do it in a console if i had to
[09:48] <Thib_> soundray: thanks!
[09:48] <Sixer> Where in ubuntu do I specify my vesafb resolution?
[09:48] <Sixer> It has no lilo.conf
[09:48] <Thib_> yes, at least it fixes the thrashing...
[09:48] <Thib_> let me try powering off
[09:48] <azureal> duaneb, well then you probably need linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
[09:48] <azureal> iirc that libstdc++ error was what i got when i tried to compile w/o headers
[09:49] <duaneb> azureal, why?
[09:49] <notwist> any idea why nautilus goes blank when i choose list view? it worked before i upgraded to 6.10
[09:49] <duaneb> azureal, I have them
[09:49] <blazemonger> anyone know that error i'm getting
[09:49] <blazemonger> i have a compile saying i dont have gnome-conf
[09:49] <blazemonger> gnome-config i mean
[09:50] <azureal> duaneb, then build-essential, do you have that?
[09:50] <duaneb> no
[09:50] <duaneb> thanks
[09:50] <duaneb> should come by default, thogh
[09:50] <Sp4rKy> hi
[09:50] <bense> what's a good graphical ftp client
[09:50] <bense> besides gftp
[09:51] <blazemonger> i dont like graphical ftp clients
[09:51] <azureal> duaneb, well, idk.. it depends which one you get.. i had ubuntu server edition, so pretty much nothing came w/ it =P
[09:51] <blazemonger> i like console stuff like ncftp2
[09:51] <mckinnoj> ok, so I broke my system screwing with xorg.config...whenever I try to boot to Edgy my monitor doesn't recognize that it's plugged in.  I'm running off of a Dapper live cd now, is there anyway for me to get to the xorg.config file from here?
[09:51] <notwist> bense: whats wrong with gftp?
[09:51] <duaneb> haha
[09:51] <Sp4rKy> please, how can i set more -I parameters with cdbs ?
[09:51] <blrakach> I like lftp for command line
[09:51] <bense> notwist, it sucks compared to flashfxp
[09:51] <notwist> bense: so run flashfxp via wine?
[09:51] <botxj> i just tried to upgrade my dapper to edgy and i got a problem about an /usr/X11R6/bin folder that i had to delete some files in it, so i did that and now i get this error
[09:51] <bense> i love this solution
[09:51] <botxj>   libpango1.0-dev: Depends: libxft-dev but it is not installed
[09:51] <botxj>   xorg-dev: Depends: libxft-dev but it is not installed
[09:51] <botxj>   xserver-xorg-core: Depends: x11-common (>= 1:7.0.0) but 7.0.0-0ubuntu45 is installed
[09:52] <azureal> LjL, yea, thx for all the info... i guess i'll try reinstalling libc6 next time i'm in console
[09:52] <notwist> bense: ?
[09:52] <notwist> what solution
[09:52] <bense> exactly
[09:52] <bense> what solution
[09:52] <CotRo|eR> what is the channel for ubuntu server pls??
[09:52] <notwist> what the hell are you talking about
[09:52] <notwist> speak sense
[09:52] <zircx> ok, has anyone suffered this sort of problem before? I can type in an address and hit enter and it will go to that address, If i click on the home link which is the same address, it comes up with the http://siteaddress/404error.html file
[09:52] <ashzilla> How can I change irssi to display my alias with color?
[09:52] <duaneb> ok
[09:52] <dcraven> bense, sorry nobody has written one to your specs.
[09:52] <duaneb> that seems to work
[09:52] <LjL> CotRo|eR: this one.
[09:52] <bense> running flashfxp with wine is not a good answer
[09:53] <optimusprime> it there a way to optimize a kernel that's already installed?
[09:53] <xSUSHi> zircx: try it in mozilla
[09:53] <crass> mckinnoj: does it just boot to the command line?
[09:53] <bense> i'll try kftpgrabber
[09:53] <blazemonger> i'm trying to find gnome-config but i can't find it anywhere
[09:53] <CotRo|eR> I need to install ISP CONFIG in my ubuntu server .. is there some command? any help pls?
[09:53] <optimusprime> or can someone tell me how to delete a kernel
[09:53] <acidt> i need help ;\ http://wklej.org/id/b1b80cafb8
[09:53] <Sixer> Hi, anyone know the VESA resolution code for 720p display?
[09:53] <zircx> ok, I have to install mozilla, i've only got firefox at teh moment
[09:53] <dcraven> ncftp is a great client.
[09:53] <ZirJoker> anyone here knows how to create shell scripts?????
[09:53] <variant> ZirJoker: yes, it is rather easy
[09:53] <xSUSHi> optimusprime: you need to re-compile your kernel.
[09:53] <mckinnoj> crass: no, my monitor displays some weird info and then goes to sleep.  If I turn it off then on, I get the same display before it promptly goes to sleep again
[09:54] <ZirJoker> variant can i have your im adress so you can help me??
[09:54] <Ayabara> hi. I had a storage ntfs partition mounted with "ntfs   defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46   0   1". now I have converted it to fat32. do I only have to change ntfs to fat32?
[09:54] <mckinnoj> crass:  The message it displays involves some weird internal monitor stuff and I'm pretty sure it isn't coming from the computer
[09:54] <CotRo|eR> I need to install ISP CONFIG in my ubuntu server .. is there some command? any help pls?
[09:54] <Sixer> Hi, anyone know the VESA resolution code for 720p display?
[09:54] <Sixer> (for inserting in lilo or grub as vga=XXX)
[09:54] <variant> ZirJoker: echo "ls -al" > lls ; sh lls
[09:55] <variant> ZirJoker: ther eyou go, a short and pointless example of a shell script named lls
[09:55] <ZirJoker> O.O
[09:55] <optimusprime> do I delete the previous installed kernel to do that?
[09:55] <mckinnoj> I'm pretty sure I can solve this problem as long as I can figure out how to access my Edgy partition while running on a live dapper cd
[09:55] <ZirJoker> i've used linux for 2 weeks now xD
[09:55] <variant> ZirJoker: lol
[09:55] <duaneb> uhh
[09:56] <duaneb> on wine: fixme:mscoree:_CorExeMain Directly running .NET applications not supported.
[09:56] <crass> mckinnoj: how does the patition table have an affect on the X issue?
[09:56] <CotRo|eR> !isp config
[09:56] <variant> ZirJoker: basically, just put commands in a text file (call it what you like) and run it with sh textfile
[09:56] <xSUSHi> optimusprime: read a tutorial on compiling your kernel, and you will replace the vmlinuz file that comes out
[09:56] <ZirJoker> i want to create a shell script that launches an application with LANGUAGE=en at the command beggining
[09:56] <crass> but in any case, I think parted might be on the live cd
[09:56] <Ayabara> anyone? are my options ok for mounting fat32?
[09:56] <ZirJoker> i want to create a script that
[09:56] <xSUSHi> optimus: /vmlinuz is the kernel file
[09:56] <azureal> ZirJoker, google bash scripting and have fun =P
[09:56] <ZirJoker> o.o
[09:56] <ZirJoker> ok...
[09:56] <roughtrader> is there a way to set port forwarding in the gnome bittorrent client?
[09:56] <mckinnoj> crass: Well, I made a copy of xorg.config before I changed anything, so I was just going to replace the new file with the original.  Should that work?
[09:56] <xSUSHi> azureal: n1
[09:57] <variant> ZirJoker: echo "LANGUAGE=wn applicationname > myscript ; sh myscript
[09:57] <variant> ZirJoker: echo "LANGUAGE=en applicationname" > myscript ; sh myscript
[09:57] <zircx> xSUSHi; is there a bug with the latest firefox?
[09:57] <zircx> it seems to work perfectly fine in mozilla..
[09:57] <crass> mckinnoj: I'm not sure, because I've had similar problems
[09:57] <crass> and I replaced it with the original and am still having issues
[09:57] <xSUSHi> zircx: hmm maybe -- try resetting the configuration
[09:57] <mckinnoj> crass: Blast
[09:57] <xSUSHi> zircx: works fine with me
[09:58] <bense> kftpgrabber works well
[09:58] <azureal> zircx, define the "home link"
[09:58] <variant> ZirJoker: you can set up bash aliases for that kinda thing though.. it is better to do it like htat
[09:58] <crass> mckinnoj: its worth a try though. my problems may come from somethingelse I did
[09:58] <crass> you should just mount the partition that has /etc and replace it
[09:58] <xSUSHi> azureal: when he types "www.google.com" he gets a 404
[09:59] <mckinnoj> crass: Does the wiki have a guide on mounting partitions?
[09:59] <mckinnoj> crass: I'm still very much a n00b
[09:59] <ZirJoker> bash aliases??
[09:59] <zircx> you mean definiing the homelink in the homepage is what would cause it to wig out?
[09:59] <xSUSHi> ZirJoker: help alias
[09:59] <variant> ZirJoker: yeah, type "man alias"
[09:59] <xSUSHi> or alias --helpl
[09:59] <crass> mckinnoj: no clue, I'm a n00b when it comes ot ubuntu, though I've been using linux for over 7 years now
[09:59] <xSUSHi> no man page for built in commands
[09:59] <pluma_> Gaile is on?
[09:59] <zircx> xSUSHi , how do you reset the configuration? on firefox
[09:59] <azureal> xSUSHi, but when it's not the homelink... so http://video.google.com/  does not give him an error?
[09:59] <pluma_> Where?
[09:59] <bense> anyone know how to turn syntax highlighting on in vim?
[10:00] <crass> mckinnoj: just try something like: mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
[10:00] <azureal> :syntax enable
[10:00] <variant> xSUSHi: good point! forgot about that
[10:00] <botxj> i just tried to upgrade my dapper to edgy and i got a problem about an /usr/X11R6/bin folder that i had to delete some files in it, so i did that and now i get this error
[10:00] <botxj>   libpango1.0-dev: Depends: libxft-dev but it is not installed

[10:00] <variant> ZirJoker: yeah, type alias --help
[10:00] <bense> that's it, thanks azureal
[10:00] <azureal> bense, np
[10:00] <zircx> I've defined the link
[10:00] <CotRo|eR> I need to install ISP CONFIG in my ubuntu server .. is there some command? any help pls?
[10:00] <xSUSHi> zircx: look in ~/.mozilla/firefox
[10:00] <crass> mckinnoj: actually, I think the live cd might automatically mount all disk partition it can
[10:00] <ZirJoker> @
[10:00] <gnomefreak> botxj: did you check to see if ubuntu-desktop package was installed?
[10:00] <ZirJoker> @_@
[10:00] <crass> perhaps in /mnt or /media or something
[10:01] <botxj> gnomefreak: no, but i'll check now...
[10:01] <bense> E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version
[10:01] <bense> arg
[10:01] <ZirJoker> ok didnt understand XD
[10:01] <ZirJoker> i typed help alias
[10:01] <gnomefreak> botxj: it might be too late now. please join me in #ubuntu-classroom and i will see what we can do to fix it
[10:01] <variant> ZirJoker: alias --help
[10:01] <ZirJoker> and readed the text but i understood nothing
[10:02] <mckinnoj> crass: hmmm, nothing in /mnt or /media
[10:02] <mckinnoj> crass: let me try mounting it myself
[10:02] <gnomefreak> ZirJoker: what is the alias you want to make?
[10:02] <ZirJoker> i want to make a launcher that launches gimp in english
[10:02] <ZirJoker> it is...
[10:02] <variant> ZirJoker: i take it back, there is no --help option to alias
[10:02] <azureal> ZirJoker, just go read your ~/.bashrc file , you'll see alias examples
[10:02] <ZirJoker> LANGUAGE=en gimp
[10:02] <gnomefreak> ZirJoker: gimp has nothing to do with bash alias' just make a launcher
[10:02] <mckinnoj> crass: the command you gave me asks me to specify the filesystem type, where would I type that?
[10:02] <bcnl> errr I don't run ubuntu on a desktop, but a friend of mine just did and says that xmms won't play mp3's.  Is there a special package he needs to install?
[10:02] <salim> is rovclock better or fglrx/ati powernowd?
[10:03] <variant> lol @ people who don't know what they want :)
[10:03] <ZirJoker> yeah my gimp is in spanish but if i make a launcher with the command "LANGUAGE=en gimp" it does nothing
[10:03] <crass> mckinnoj: if it says that then lifely its the wrong partition, or disk
[10:04] <kromagg> hiya, I'm trying to use the ROUTE target in iptables but it doesn't seem to be included, did it get sorted to another package or something?
[10:04] <gnomefreak> ZirJoker: is everything in spanish?
[10:04] <xSUSHi> bcnl: get Automatix   it'll download all the codecs you need
[10:04] <gnomefreak> no
[10:04] <defrysk> oooh
[10:04] <defrysk> nono
[10:04] <ZirJoker> most of it i installed gimpshop and there are somethings in spanish
[10:04] <bcnl> xSUSHi: thanks
[10:04] <ZirJoker> i mean
[10:04] <slinky_> i'm having a problem with file types and open with appearing twice, can someone help me
[10:04] <crass> mckinnoj: you should look at the output of the dmesg command to see what the devices are
[10:04] <ZirJoker> somethings in english
[10:04] <gnomefreak> xSUSHi: please dont advise things that can and will hurt a system
[10:04] <defrysk> not aUTODESASTERIX
[10:04] <azureal> ZirJoker, something like     alias gimpen='LANGUAGE=en gimp'     doesnt work?
[10:04] <ZirJoker> but i want to make it all english im more used to it since i used to use photoshpo in english
[10:04] <azureal> <in bashrc>
[10:05] <xSUSHi> ZirJoker if you launch gimp in a terminal using gimp LANGUANG=en       does that work ?
[10:05] <ZirJoker> ... where do i have to put that? im new in linux
[10:05] <ZirJoker> let me see
[10:05] <xSUSHi> do you know what a terminal is
[10:05] <azureal> rofl
[10:05] <azureal> xSUSHi, nice =P
[10:06] <crass> ZirJoker: it might be LANGUAGE=en_US
[10:06] <ZirJoker> it opens, but it tries to open "LANGUAGE=en" file :P
[10:06] <xSUSHi> zirjoker: i think the file you want to edit is ~/.gimprc
[10:06] <ZirJoker> ...
[10:06] <ZirJoker> where do i find that file?
[10:06] <variant> ZirJoker: in ~/
[10:06] <azureal> ~     =  /home/<username>
[10:06] <LjL> !automatix | xSUSHi, bcnl
[10:06] <ubotu> xSUSHi, bcnl: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[10:07] <azureal> ZirJoker, try 'cd ~' to better understand the wonderful ~
[10:07] <ZirJoker> if i open terminal and put LANGUAGE=en gimp it launches in english, but i want to add a launcher in my starter
[10:07] <variant> ZirJoker: the ~ represents your home directory
[10:07] <xroach> when i try to startx it gives me a error but i cant read it it shows up so quick, can i read it somewehere?
[10:07] <ZirJoker> the file is blank
[10:07] <variant> i give up :)
[10:07] <ZirJoker> that's why i asked that question
[10:07] <Phinite> I want to export the display of my ubuntu box back to my windows box running xming.  can anyone assist with this?
[10:07] <crass> ZirJoker: you said it didn't work a while ago
[10:08] <ZirJoker> it does not work in a launcher
[10:08] <ZirJoker> but it does in terminal
[10:08] <azureal> ZirJoker, do you have a ~/.gimprc file/
[10:08] <crass> what is a launcher?
[10:08] <azureal> ?
[10:08] <ZirJoker> launcher is a shortcut...
[10:08] <Ayabara> I got my fat32 drive mounted, but I don't have permissions to view some folders. any hints appreciated
[10:08] <azureal> ok, installing gimp =P
[10:08] <ZirJoker> i think i dont have a .gimprc file
[10:08] <azureal> we'll see =)
[10:09] <xSUSHi> im not sure if thats even the correct location - i dont use gimp =] 
[10:09] <ZirJoker> xD
[10:09] <xSUSHi> ok found it
[10:09] <blazemonger> i can't find gnome-libs package or gnome-config .....would it be possible to install it from a .deb source?
[10:09] <xSUSHi> ~/.gimp-2.2/gimprc
[10:09] <xst> Since edgy, X has been broken for most Matrox cards. A bug has been filed for long time ago (http://tinyurl.com/y8o6z7) but it seems to be ignored by the maintainer. What can I do then?
[10:09] <ZirJoker> ok
[10:09] <ZirJoker> it opened
=== SinnerG_Work is now known as SinnerG
[10:10] <slinky_> can someone help me with file types and associations?
[10:10] <ZirJoker> now that do i have to do?
[10:10] <blazemonger> I don't want to  have to leave ubuntu so i can compile sources on freshmeat.net :(
[10:10] <PSUSI> Ayabara: only some folders?
[10:10] <azureal> it's a race
[10:10] <PSUSI> Ayabara: you mounted it with the uid=yourname option right?
[10:10] <blazemonger> azureal do you know how to get gnome-config and gnome-libs installed ?
[10:11] <gnome_guy> My usb external hdd that was working under this same ubuntu box, 1 hour ago, doesn't work any longer .. How can I fix this problem?
[10:11] <blazemonger> i cant find it anywhere in the ubuntu edgy repositories but i was able to find it on debian's site
[10:11] <xSUSHi> zirjoker: in console terminal, type LANG=en   then press enter    then type gimp   and enter
[10:11] <azureal> lol
[10:11] <msmith> what's up with the devs working on the ndiswrapper repos? isn't ndiswrapper vital to most *buntu users trying to get their wlan up and running?
[10:11] <ZirJoker> it launched in english :D
[10:12] <PSUSI> gnome_guy: hit it with a hammer?  or be more specific about what doesn't work, any error messages, and what you have tried so far ( powering everything off and restarting? unplugging and replugging? )
[10:12] <ZirJoker> but.... is everything else gonna be in english?
[10:12] <xSUSHi> everything you launch in that term
[10:12] <xSUSHi> until you type exit
[10:12] <ZirJoker> hahaha
[10:12] <ZirJoker> but...
[10:12] <stuart_> If I copy my xorg.conf from suse to ubuntu would it fix my mouse problem or is mouse configuration handled elsewhere?
[10:12] <ZirJoker> xDDDD
[10:12] <xSUSHi> zirjoker: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=73885
[10:13] <ZirJoker> its the same thing if i just type LANGUAGE=en gimp
[10:13] <blazemonger> i can't find any way tocompile this
[10:13] <PSUSI> gnome_guy: and of course, what happened in the last hour between the time it worked and didnt?  sudden power failure?  you unplug it without unmounting and waiting a while?
[10:13] <slinky_> where do i find a list of file extentions and the associated programs?
[10:13] <ZirJoker> i want to add a launcher in english
[10:13] <blazemonger> trying to compile a mathematics program and it complains of having not found gnome-config and some file in gnome-lib a file named gnomeConf.sh

[10:14] <ZirJoker> lets try that
[10:14] <holiday42> i've got a friends ubuntu 6.06 machine.  has agere winmodem.  works fine after i compiled& loaded the martian_drv & loaded martian_helper... but there's no gui saying connecting or no dialtone, etc when I enable the dialer... this stuff can be seen in /var/log/messages though.  no problem for me but -- my friend isnot familiar with console usage.  is there's supposed to be a status windows...
[10:14] <holiday42> ...that pops up?
[10:14] <gnome_guy> PSUSI, Before removing it, I right-click on it > eject.
[10:14] <PSUSI> blazemonger: development libraries, headers, and tools are not installed by default... you probably need to install the proper -devel package
[10:14] <ZirJoker> Detalles: Ha ocurrido un error al ejecutar el proceso hijo LANG=en|gimp (No existe el fichero  directorio)
[10:14] <ZirJoker> that means...

[10:15] <blazemonger> i found gnome-libs-data but no gnome-libs
[10:15] <ZirJoker> but i could try it backwards
[10:15] <blazemonger> and cant find gnome-config at all..
[10:15] <gnome_guy> PSUSI,  doesn't kernel recognizes usb hdd as scsi device?
[10:16] <PSUSI> blazemonger: you can search for which package ( if any ) contains a specific file on packages.ubuntu.com
[10:16] <holiday42> good idea, thanks xSUSHi
[10:16] <ZirJoker> no...
[10:16] <idefix> what plugins do I need to install for the error code "totem could not play 'fd://0'" ?
[10:16] <blazemonger> i have gnome-devel installed too
[10:16] <ZirJoker> i cant.,.
[10:16] <ZirJoker> xD
[10:16] <PSUSI> Ayabara: check your logs for error messages, the filesystem is probably damaged
[10:16] <slinky_> when i right click on a file it says open with rhythmbox twice,any ideas as to why it appears twice
[10:16] <pibarnas> I can't save programs on gnome-settings-manager, I don't know why...can you help me?
[10:16] <PSUSI> gnome_guy: yea
[10:16] <captine> hi all.  i use a FAT partition to share files between ubuntu and windows.  however, my fat folders are viewed as read only by windows, and will not change.  Does Ubuntu cause this?
[10:16] <Ayabara> PSUSI: ok. where can I find those logs?
[10:16] <azureal> since we're talking about LANG, is there a way to list all things that LANG can be assigned to?
[10:16] <PSUSI> Ayabara: in /var/log
[10:17] <gnome_guy> PSUSI, But i don't see any SDA under /dev
[10:17] <blazemonger> how do i find out what files are in a apt package
[10:17] <gnome_guy> sda
[10:17] <gnome_guy> even
[10:17] <xSUSHi> LANG=   just sets the enviorment label
[10:17] <PSUSI> Ayabara: specifically /var/log/messages or kern.log
[10:17] <xSUSHi> type set to list them all
[10:17] <xSUSHi> or export
[10:17] <coolpaul900> What do I do if I get an error with wine saying Could not load the DLL library?
[10:18] <ZirJoker> o.o
[10:18] <PSUSI> gnome_guy: it might not be sda.... check your log or the output of dmesg to see where it was detected and assigned a device name
[10:18] <ZirJoker> what?
[10:18] <ZirJoker> xD
[10:18] <blazemonger> PSUSI: I can't find the development files i neeed but they ARE in debian though
[10:18] <xroach> how can i see my 3d cards BusID
[10:18] <blazemonger> is it possible to use the packages from debian?
[10:18] <blazemonger> like from source
[10:18] <PSUSI> blazemonger: in which package?  they are probably the same in ubuntu
[10:18] <coolpaul900> What do I do if I get an error with wine saying Could not load the DLL library?
[10:18] <salim> how dangerous is the undervolting pentium m?
[10:18] <gnome_guy> PSUSI,  what's the differences between dmesg and lsusb ? ..  I thought any device that is plugged into usb port , must be seen as lsusb ?
[10:18] <blazemonger> PSUSI: gnome-libs and gnome-config
[10:19] <Ayabara> PSUSI: found nothing relevant. searched for sda3 and the mount folder
[10:19] <PSUSI> gnome_guy: that works too
[10:19] <ompaul> salim,  that would be a question for ##intel if there be such a beast (which I doubt)
[10:19] <coolpaul900> What do I do if I get an error with wine saying Could not load the DLL library?
[10:19] <idefix> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[10:19] <idefix> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[10:19] <idefix> 
[10:19] <idefix> what's that?
[10:19] <gnome_guy> PSUSI,  All i get under lsusb is Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
[10:19] <PSUSI> blazemonger: have you installed gnome-libs?
[10:19] <iter> idefix: are you root ?
[10:19] <xroach> how can i see my 3d cards BusID
[10:19] <idefix> yes
[10:19] <idefix> iter yes
[10:19] <variant> is it just me or is the free60 project deader than a smashed brick?
[10:20] <stuart_> If I copy my xorg.conf from suse to ubuntu would it fix my mouse problem or is mouse configuration handled elsewhere?
[10:20] <iter> idefix: lsof | grep /var/lib/dpkg
[10:20] <xSUSHi> idefix: you dont have package manager open do you
[10:20] <coolpaul900> What do I do if I get an error with wine saying Could not load the DLL library?
[10:20] <azureal> xSUSHi, oh, i think simply "set LANG" brings LANG back to what it was before
[10:20] <ZirJoker> xSUSHo what do i have to do now?
[10:20] <idefix> xSUSHi thx
[10:20] <blazemonger> it's not available
[10:20] <PSUSI> Ayabara: ok... do this: tail /var/log/messages, then go try to access the drive and see if any mor emessages pop up
[10:20] <blazemonger> that's what i'm trying to say
[10:20] <g333k_work> Hi do I reduce the auto login delay time in gdm?

[10:21] <ulrik> hey guys. some trouble with edgy, of course; how do I adjust keys in console? I can't use alt or altgr. I want this to match my gnome settings.
[10:21] <xSUSHi> ZirJoker: I think gimp only runs whatever language is in the LANG variable... you're going to have to use that to launch gimp
[10:21] <PSUSI> salim: apt-cache search linux-image to see what is availible
[10:22] <Ayabara> PSUSI: no more messages appear
[10:22] <ZirJoker> so can I add a gimp (english version) launcher to my desktop??
[10:22] <xSUSHi> Is it okay for me to delete the deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives?  It's getting quite bulky
[10:22] <variant> xSUSHi: yup
[10:22] <xSUSHi> nice
[10:23] <ZirJoker> or will i have to use terminal to laucnh my english version gimp forever and ever?
[10:23] <PSUSI> Ayabara: ok... unmount the drive and fsck it
[10:23] <blazemonger> i have all of the gnome-devel packages installed too
[10:23] <blazemonger> i cant get this proggie to compile at all
[10:24] <PSUSI> Ayabara: and if you didn't know already; no, fsck is not a swear word ;)
[10:24] <notwist> PSUSI: i love those tshirts.. "fsck it"
=== micah_c is now known as micahcowan
[10:24] <xSUSHi> Zirjoker: you will need to make a shell script and have your launcher run that script.
[10:24] <Ayabara> PSUSI: :-D , I figured that out
[10:25] <Ayabara> PSUSI: fsck outputs nothing that looks like an error to me
[10:25] <variant> xSUSHi: why cant he make a desktop icon launcer? thats what he wanted to do in the first place
[10:25] <blazemonger> PSUSI:i can't find anything related to gnome-config or gnome-libs
[10:25] <blazemonger> it's specificly asking for the package gnome-libs
[10:25] <ZirJoker> xDDDDDDDDDDDD
[10:25] <blazemonger> is it in the backports maybe?
[10:25] <xSUSHi> Zirjoker: the shell script is only a text file that contains "LANG=en gimp"
[10:25] <ZirJoker> i knew it!!!
[10:25] <ZirJoker> xDDDD
[10:25] <ompaul> !enter
[10:25] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[10:25] <xSUSHi> variant: cuz he needs gimp to run in english
[10:25] <ZirJoker> and it haves to be called gimpen.sh
[10:25] <PSUSI> date ; wine ; finger ; unzip ; yes ; yes ; yes ; gasp ; zip ; sleep < best command line ever
[10:25] <ZirJoker> right?
[10:25] <variant> ZirJoker: right click your desktop > new launcher> run command ="LANG=en gimp"
[10:25] <blazemonger> i have gnome-devel installed but there is nowhere to be found gnome-libs or gnome-config..

[10:29] <blazemonger> :(
[10:29] <PSUSI> Ayabara: hrm... strange... if the filesystem isn't damaged, you should have access to all of it or none
[10:29] <znejk> xSUSHi: cause i aint got not cd or floppy and its a new ibm laptop

[10:35] <coolpaul900> can some one help?
[10:35] <sith-lord> not sure
[10:35] <blazemonger> since ubuntu doesnt have the development stuffs for compiling 90% of the stuff on freshmeat

[10:36] <LazyFrog> xSUSHi... umm.. I think so... I have Ubuntu 6.10 and do build-essentials come by default?

[10:36] <coolpaul900> How do I do this **Changed in: Ubuntu Sourcepackagename: None => linux-source-2.6.17?
[10:36] <PSUSI> blazemonger: try reading the readme in this package... it should tell you what libraries you need to build it, and are you sure you don't have the files already and it just isn't finding them ( not looking in the right place? )?
[10:36] <coolpaul900> I was told to do this
[10:37] <coolpaul900> From my bug report
[10:37] <xSUSHi> idefix: you probably need to open a port in iptables
[10:37] <ZirJoker> hahahah ok, in conclusion I solved my problem XD a shell script was the solution the script is LANGUAGE=en gimp and then I saved the file with ".sh" at the end of it :P

[10:38] <blazemonger> it doesnt mention the libraries i need at all

[10:39] <PSUSI> Ayabara: strange.... 000 means nobody gets any access
[10:39] <LazyFrog> xSUSHi but I must have build-essentials because it finds gcc... or is that separate from build-essentials... and if they don't come by default in 6.10 where can I download them from :p
[10:39] <LazyFrog> ?
[10:39] <Ayabara> PSUSI: it says 000 in the edgy guide as well
[10:40] <blazemonger> can anyone see if they can find gnome-libs or gnome-config
[10:40] <idefix> xSUSHi, but the firewall is probably blocking right?
[10:40] <Donald1> What is Edgy?
[10:40] <Geoffrey2> Edgy is the latest version of Ubuntu....6.10
[10:40] <blazemonger> the way the repositories are everyting has these different names

[10:40] <tsoler> pppr
[10:40] <Ayabara> with 0777 I didn't get access to anything

[10:41] <Carolinamusicman> I got to question for anyone to answer Im currently running Ubuntu 6.06 and the Hddtemp saids my hard drive is running at 54 degrees C is that ok or is it that something to be concern about.
[10:41] <Ayabara> PSUSU: the guide says to use this line for read/write: "/dev/hda1    /media/windows vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0"
[10:41] <KooL4444> what file are the dns entries in?
[10:41] <PSUSI> xSUSHi: no... 222 is write only, no read, no execute
[10:42] <idefix> xSUSHi, do you know by heart which ports are needed for video streaming?
[10:42] <blazemonger> PSUSI: i can't find anything with the name of gnome-libs or gnome-config
[10:42] <PSUSI> xSUSHi: see man chmod
[10:42] <xSUSHi> psusi: my bad i was backwards
[10:42] <maxflax> I get this errors when compiling.. http://pastebin.perl.se/0de8eb8970/ the imon VFD driver.. anyone now what I can do to fix it?
[10:42] <Ayabara> PSUSI: anyway. I set permissions of the last 2 folders manually, remounted it, and now it seems to work
[10:43] <Geoffrey2> I'm about to install Edgy....backed up everything I need to save...anything else I should do before I start the install?
[10:43] <Ayabara> with the line I just wrote
[10:43] <xSUSHi> psusi: and 222 is r/w no execute.
[10:43] <xSUSHi> i mean 6
[10:43] <PSUSI> blazemonger: I see gnome-libs-data
[10:43] <blazemonger> i'm still not having any luck finding the packages in the repositories..
[10:43] <xSUSHi> im sleepy
[10:43] <xSUSHi> blazemonger: do you have all the repositories open?
[10:44] <PSUSI> Ayabara: fat does not support permissions, you can not set them on individual files/directories, which is why you have to specify them when mounting
[10:44] <xSUSHi> blazemonger: did you edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:44] <shwag> how do I turnoff a bootup service ?
[10:44] <PSUSI> xSUSHi: yes, 6 is w/r no x... but you want x so you can traverse directories and execute any programs
[10:45] <sid> I install xubuntu edgy, and then I did sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. Everything worked fine. But my splash screen is wrong. it shows xubuntu splash screen on boot, not ubuntu
[10:45] <phillip> hey i did this: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#How_to_install_Multimedia_Codecs    but theres no sound in my videos.
[10:45] <Ayabara> PSUSI: ehh. I don't mean to be rude, but setting them manually worked for me....
[10:45] <sid> How can I have the on boot splash screen be ubuntu?
[10:45] <bung_> shwag: man update-rc.d
[10:45] <blazemonger> xSUSHi everything except the backports i dont do backports
[10:45] <ashzilla> Hi, after I upgraded to Edgy, downloaded the package that contains the linux-headers for the 2.6.17-10 kernek, and running the /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl script to update Vmware, it no longer runs... does anyone have any helpful ideas to get it fixed?
[10:45] <gottreu> does eft allow for multiple architectures?  (ie. 32 and 64 bit packages for AMD64)
[10:46] <dg6e74> would anyone be intrested in helping me set up a network
[10:46] <PSUSI> blazemonger: try libgnome-dev.... and do you have a specific file name it says it can't find?
[10:46] <maxflax> I get this errors when compiling.. http://pastebin.perl.se/0de8eb8970/ the imon VFD driver.. anyone now what I can do to fix it?
[10:46] <Ayabara> PSUSI: I have recently reformatted this drive from ntfs to fat32 (a couple of reboots ago). could that have something to do with it?
[10:46] <PSUSI> Ayabara: this is a fat disk right?
[10:46] <Ayabara> PSUSI: yes, and that's what fsck said too
[10:46] <blazemonger> yah
[10:47] <ashzilla> Hi, after I upgraded to Edgy, downloaded the package that contains the linux-headers for the 2.6.17-10 kernek, and running the /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl script to update Vmware, it no longer runs... does anyone have any helpful ideas to get it fixed?
[10:47] <PSUSI> Ayabara: fat( 12/16/32 ) has no means of storing permissions, so any chmod you do will be forgotten when you remount
[10:47] <fran> does anyone here use spyware software?
[10:47] <blazemonger> gnomeConf.sh
[10:47] <ashzilla> what's the gnu command to check disk space, ect

[10:48] <keiron> hi. i can mount my windows machine successfully with the following fstab entry: //192.168.0.2/Desktop    /home/keiron/dawn smbfs dmask=777,fmask=777  0    0 but i have to do sudo mount -a on boot to get it to mount
[10:48] <keiron> is there any way to get it to mount automatically on boot?
[10:48] <xSUSHi> ashzilla: also try du
[10:48] <PSUSI> VitoGirl: the server?  if you installed it, then it is running already
[10:48] <crunner> how do i use wine with ubuntu?
[10:48] <raconteur> anybody use swiftfox? Is the performance worth the download?
[10:48] <Ayabara> PSUSI: that's weird. they survived my remount..
[10:49] <PSUSI> Ayabara: that is totally fubar then... don't know what to tell you... fat was designed for dos which had no concept of permissions
[10:49] <VitoGirl> okey
[10:49] <VitoGirl> :)
[10:49] <shiv> I get 0x7 error on grub for my windows partition. Has anybody resolved this?

[10:49] <blazemonger> PSUSI is mandriva easier than ubuntu?
[10:49] <xSUSHi> keiron: add mount -a into your rc
[10:49] <shwag> what package contains smbmount and smbtree ?
[10:50] <LazyFrog> Do build-essentials come default with 6.10 ?
[10:50] <PSUSI> blazemonger: I have no knowlege of mandriva
[10:50] <xSUSHi> keiron: in /etc/rc.local
[10:50] <blazemonger> PSUSI how can i find the files i need
[10:50] <Ayabara> PSUSI: it looks very very weird, so I don't know if I'm happy that it seemingly works... thanks for helping anyway :-)
[10:50] <sid> I switched from xubuntu to ubuntu(I was on xubuntu and did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop), gnome works fine and all. But my bootsplash when I first boot(before gdm) shows xubuntu splash screen. How do I change that?
[10:50] <blazemonger> do you know which package has gnomeConf.sh
[10:50] <PSUSI> shiv: you mean error: partition type 07 not recognized?
[10:50] <notwist> Im trying to rip streams in mplayer, i can watch them OK with sound and everything but when i watch the ripped file theres no sound. Any idea why? please :)
[10:51] <xroach> can anyone helpp?
[10:51] <PSUSI> blazemonger: did you try the libdev package I sugested?  or searching for the file on packages.ubuntu.com?
[10:51] <dg6e74> anyone know the command to start a dchp sever
[10:51] <spanglesontoast> hemp
[10:51] <pixelPOET> hemp?
[10:51] <blazemonger> i tried it
[10:51] <blazemonger> didnt work
[10:51] <blazemonger> neither method has worked
[10:51] <maxflax> I get this errors when compiling.. http://pastebin.perl.se/0de8eb8970/ the imon VFD driver.. can anyone help me or are all here just noobs without any linux knowledge?
[10:52] <xblast> Is there anyway that I can change the language of my ubuntu after installation?
[10:52] <xSUSHi> blazemonger: You need the gnome-libs-devel rpm
[10:52] <PSUSI> blazemonger: then go download the sourece tarball yourself
[10:52] <PSUSI> xSUSHi: in ubuntu it looks like that is called libgnome-dev
[10:52] <blazemonger> how do i install the rpms xst
[10:53] <Thib_> okay folks
[10:53] <mixandgo> i have this : "net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding=1" in sysctl.conf but still in proc it's =0 any ideea why ?
[10:53] <Thib_> I think I've identified a stranger problem than just "hibernate doesn't work"
[10:53] <teclo> Hm, just upgrade to 6.10 and now Xorg always take more than 95% of the CPU, and Firefox is very very slow.... any idea ?
[10:53] <xSUSHi> psusi: maybe get the rpm and use alien?
[10:53] <PSUSI> teclo: what kind of video card do you have?  sounds like acceleration isn't working
[10:53] <xSUSHi> blazemonger rather
[10:54] <phillip> were w32codecs removed from the repositories?
[10:54] <Thib_> so apparently now, if I hibernate, the machine really just shuts down (and then reboots from scratch if I push the button), *and* my swap partition gets hosed
[10:54] <PSUSI> xSUSHi: either that or just get the source tarball that the readme for the source tarball he has says to?
[10:54] <keiron> xSUSHi: excellent thank you
[10:54] <teclo> PSUSI: indeed acceleration isn't working. I ran the nvidia installer, but the compilation fails...
[10:54] <Thib_> every time I go to hibernate, my swap partition fails to work.
[10:54] <MitchM> sweet.
[10:54] <PSUSI> Thib_: why do you say your swap partition is hosed?  hibernation means to shut down and save the contents of ram to the swap partition
[10:54] <Mon> i've got the weirdest problem.. only the numpad of my keyboard works. not even the onscreen keyboard works. this mean something to anyone?
[10:55] <bary> yo
[10:55] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[10:55] <bary> yep
[10:55] <PSUSI> teclo: try installing the package from ubuntu instead of directly from nv
[10:55] <maxflax> ok.. it is as I thought.. only newbies in this channel... with no real knowledge
[10:55] <Thib_> PSUSI: I say it gets hosed because when the computer comes back up, GParted says that the partition is unusable, and because my computer thrashes real bad
[10:55] <bary> go to /bin and configure esx.ega
[10:55] <teclo> teclo: how do I do that ?
[10:55] <teclo> PSUSI: how do I do th at ?
[10:55] <xSUSHi> mon: have you tried using different keyboard layouts?
[10:55] <dg6e74> help plz the only thing i can access online is irc???
[10:55] <sid> I switched from xubuntu to ubuntu(I was on xubuntu and did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop), gnome works fine and all. But my bootsplash when I first boot(before gdm) shows xubuntu splash screen. How do I change that?
[10:56] <Mon> xSUSHi: hmm no.. it's US as it's always been and should be
[10:56] <Mon> could give it a go iguess...
[10:56] <blazemonger> its working now pablo_
[10:56] <blazemonger> PSUSI
[10:56] <xSUSHi> mon: system -> preferences -> keyboard click around in there maybe a layout is dammaged?
[10:56] <blazemonger> i'm a bit blazed heh
[10:56] <PSUSI> Thib_: when you hibernate the swap partition is replaced with the hibernation data.... when you reboot the kernel needs a resume= parameter to point it to the swap device to load the hibernation data and resume
[10:56] <Flamekebab> dg6e74, again, with more details and in English?
[10:56] <Thib_> PSUSI: I and I say that "hibernating causes it" not to mean that it literally causes it (because I really don't know), but just because clearly I can stop and restart my machine as often as I want without trouble, but if I select hibernate once, my swap partition is then flagged as bad and my computer thrashes.
[10:57] <phargle> maybe it had something to do with hibernate
[10:57] <bary> can anyone give me a virus
[10:57] <bary> i need to analyze it
[10:57] <crass> Thib_: did you turn off the splash screen for boot?
[10:57] <xSUSHi> bary: /kick
[10:57] <PSUSI> Thib_: sounds like that is because your machine is not resuming from the hibernation, so the hibernation data is left sitting on the swap device
[10:57] <bary> why
[10:57] <bary> i would like to secure my os
[10:57] <notwist> in some files mplayer says "Could not open/initialize audio device -> no sound." - but it works fine in amarok and other files in mplayer. Any ideas why? I've tested a downloaded stream and an .mp4 file and got the same error. Anyone? :)
[10:57] <stuart__> If I copy my suse config will it fix this problem -> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=284297
[10:58] <PSUSI> Thib_: make sure your kernel command line has the proper resume= parameter
[10:58] <bary> can anyone help me in obtaining knowledge to secure my os
[10:58] <salim> mine is compiling a kernel right now, can I watch a movie during that with VLC?
[10:58] <Thib_> crass: I didn't do anything specific, except upgrade from Dapper to Edgy; in Dapper it "just worked" and now it doesn't, but I'd never had to set things before, so I don't know.
[10:58] <xSUSHi> bary: yes, but giving a newbie a virus isn't the way to go
[10:58] <tsoler> hey guys
[10:58] <Mon> xSUSHi: can keyboard layouts be "damaged" ? ...
[10:58] <bary> what is the best way
[10:58] <tsoler> can anyone help me?
[10:58] <crass> is there a way to 'reset' the rc*.d scripts, something modified them so that almost nothing runs on boot now
[10:58] <Thib_> PSUSI: that sounds like a reasonable explanation; but I don't know where that resume= param gets set, where do I do that?
[10:58] <bary> if i can defeat a virus i can defeat everything
[10:58] <tsoler> anyone available?
[10:59] <tsoler> hello
[10:59] <crass> Thib_: its a kinown issue that it doesn't work with usplash, you have to turn it off in the kernel parameters
[10:59] <xSUSHi> mon: probably not =]   maybe re-initialize it
[10:59] <PSUSI> Thib_: if you use grub to boot, in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:59] <Flamekebab> tsoler, whatcha need?
[10:59] <xSUSHi> bary: try linuxsecurity.com
[10:59] <xst> blazemonger: Why do you ask me? But anyway: With the debian package named "alien" you can install rpms very easily
[10:59] <tsoler> need some help on postgres
[10:59] <bary> cool sushi
[10:59] <PSUSI> anyhow, time for me to head home... bbl
[10:59] <shwag> what package contains smbmount and smbtree ?
[10:59] <bary> what do you want me to do
[10:59] <Mon> shwag: try packages.debian.org
[10:59] <idefix> where are the logfiles stored?
[10:59] <Thib_> crass: same question as PSUSI; I don't know where those parameters are set. If you tell me a file, I'll go look, but I don't know enough to know where these things are.
[10:59] <Mon> shwag: you can search for any file there
[10:59] <Flamekebab> tsoler, sorry, can't help you there, I've never gone within five kilometres of Postgres
[10:59] <Thib_> PSUSI: I'll go look right now.

[11:01] <tsoler> im a very new user , should i get an upgrade?
[11:01] <Flamekebab> which version are you using at the moment, tsoler ?
[11:01] <tsoler> the dapper??
[11:01] <sid> I switched from xubuntu to ubuntu(I was on xubuntu and did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop), gnome works fine and all. But my bootsplash when I first boot(before gdm) shows xubuntu splash screen. How do I change that?
[11:01] <Flamekebab> dapper drake
[11:01] <Flamekebab> 6.06
[11:01] <[gen2] niki> hi
[11:01] <tsoler> yes
[11:01] <Flamekebab> stick with 6.06 for now
[11:01] <[gen2] niki> iam new to ubuntu
[11:01] <[gen2] niki> :O
[11:01] <Flamekebab> 6.10 is "edgy"
[11:01] <teclo> ok it works :)
[11:01] <Flamekebab> ie it's got loads of unstable crap in it
[11:02] <Flamekebab> hehe
[11:02] <[gen2] niki> i used gentoo before, but ubuntu is very cool
[11:02] <maxflax> I get this errors when compiling.. http://pastebin.perl.se/0de8eb8970/ the imon VFD driver.. anyone know what I can do to fix it?
[11:02] <tsoler> got that
[11:02] <wikijeff> Any idea why when trying to view flash videos, sometimes I only get sound??
[11:02] <Flamekebab> I love Edgy, because it has lots of new stuff I like!
[11:02] <xSUSHi> im sticking with dapper for a bit too
[11:02] <Flamekebab> but for most people, I'd say stick with Dapper
[11:02] <tsoler> is there any reason for upgrading?
[11:02] <teclo> Hm, how can I turn off this annoying thing that put red lines under what I type ? This isn't winword.exe or something
[11:02] <shwag> oh brother, there is no one in here that knows where smbtree is ?
[11:02] <tsoler> like what flame?
[11:02] <Xal2> My hard drive has recently changed positions, and now my linux partition is sda3 rather than sdb1. How can I adapt my linux installation to this so I don't have to reinstall?
[11:02] <Flamekebab> like the newest version of Kino, for example
[11:03] <Flamekebab> or at least, the ability to compile it
[11:03] <OmnipotentEntity> Is anyone else having a problem getting buddy icons to show up on Gaim?
[11:03] <variant> teclo: you using xchat?
[11:03] <tsoler> kino is for what/.
[11:03] <teclo> variant: yes
[11:03] <variant> teclo: you can probably turn it of in options
[11:03] <Thib_> crass: my most recent kernel line is: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=UUID=3306ed3e-beee-4438-b66c-3d3e124e4514 ro quiet splash
[11:03] <xSUSHi> xal2: when you boot you have to give it the option root=sda3
[11:03] <stuart__> Xal2: I think all that is needed is to edit your grub settings
[11:03] <phillip> were w32codecs removed from the repositories?
[11:03] <crass> Xal2: you should use partition uuid in fstab
[11:03] <Thib_> crass: what should it be? nosplash instead of splash?
[11:03] <tsoler> me very new to ubuntu : one week or less
[11:03] <crass> Thib_: yes, take out the splash
[11:03] <Xal2> I've done that, but a lot of things aren't working correctly.
[11:03] <Thib_> oh, take out
[11:03] <crass> just delete the word
[11:03] <Flamekebab> tsoler, what do you think so far?
[11:03] <tsoler> trying to find alternatives for windows
[11:04] <stuart__> If I copy my suse config will it fix this problem -> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=284297
[11:04] <Xal2> I got it to boot, but the display manager for instance doesn't work.
[11:04] <tsoler> i thing something is happening here
[11:04] <crass> Xal2: meaning it boots into the terminal?
[11:04] <xblast> Can I change the language of my ubuntu installation?
[11:04] <Thib_> crass: is there a template somewhere that I can also change so that next time there is a new kernel it doesn't get "splash" automatically again?
[11:04] <Xal2> Nope
[11:04] <Xal2> I'm in KDE now.
[11:04] <tsoler> a strong turn point for me
[11:04] <Flamekebab> tsoler, good to hear it!

[11:05] <tsoler> flame are u an old ubuntu user/?
[11:05] <mikedoty> Greetings, fellow ubuntuoans.  Yesterday, I made an attempt to install drivers for my nVidia graphics card.  Tragically, I made ubuntu really mad at me and had to use bimbari's kindful help to run dpkg-configure on my machine.  Today, I am back where I started after I installed ubuntu yesterday, though I have (I think) installed the nvidia drivers in the ordeal; however, if I have them installed, I do not believe I have them acti
[11:05] <crass> Thib_: I don't know, I'm new to ubuntu
[11:05] <Flamekebab> tsoler, I've been using it for, hmm, since hoary beta
[11:05] <bung_> Thib_: probably
[11:05] <Flamekebab> which was version 5.04
[11:05] <bung_> Thib_: vim /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:05] <mikedoty> In my interest of not doing this again ... what should I first do to activate the drivers (presuming I have them installed)?
[11:05] <bung_> change the #defoptions bitty
[11:05] <Thib_> crass: oh :-) well, you certainly looked better than that :-)
[11:05] <idefix> damn damn double damn
[11:05] <bung_> then run update-grub
[11:05] <tsoler> experienced with another linux distribution before?
[11:06] <mikedoty> I have an nvidia display settings section in my ... Applications menu
[11:06] <Flamekebab> so around 18 months
[11:06] <Thib_> bung_: ah, yes, I see how that would work
[11:06] <idefix> one of you guys must have a printer installed, no?
[11:06] <Thib_> crass: thanks for helping
[11:06] <Flamekebab> tsoler, a little Fedora, Suse, other things
[11:06] <crass> Thib_: I've been using linux for many years, but I'm just new to ubuntu and its quirks
[11:06] <c_lisp> hey when its time for my screen saver to show all I get is a black screen what can be causing that?
[11:06] <tsoler> so ubuntu at a whole is  a new birth
[11:06] <bung_> faf with update-grub a lot, or your work will just get clobbered.
[11:06] <Flamekebab> but I only really took the plunge with Ubuntu
[11:06] <Thib_> bung_: okay, I'll try that.
[11:06] <Thib_> okay, I'm going to try hibernating again
[11:06] <tsoler> cant compare iys my first linyx installation
[11:07] <Flamekebab> tsoler, what do you think of ubuntu so far?
[11:07] <tsoler> to be  honest im shocked with open source so far
[11:07] <webmaren> every time i modprobe my ndiswrapper, my system freezes
[11:08] <crass> thanks bung_
[11:08] <tsoler> i mean even now that i m booted from windows im using gaim
=== stuart__ is now known as Paybacl
=== Paybacl is now known as Payback
[11:08] <tsoler> i think that it wiil help to do things

[11:28] <zlack> gnome_guy: check /var/log/messages for anything connected
[11:28] <kmaynard> bense, dunno...
[11:28] <bense> there is no way that that kind of delay can be due to binary optimization
[11:28] <zlack> gnome_guy: tail -f /var/log/messages and see what happens if you plug it in
[11:28] <kmaynard> probably a host file thing
[11:28] <bense> kmaynard, i just checked, they're identical

[11:35] <zlack> mabus: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade ?
[11:35] <alecjw> tobi: you can't talk to ubotu, it's a bot, if you want to ask it for info on gnu for example, do this:
[11:35] <alecjw> !gnu
[11:35] <ubotu> G(NU's) N(ot) U(nix). A project that aimed to develop a complete operating system of Free Software, which Ubuntu is based on. See http://gnu.org
[11:35] <gnome_guy> zlack,  Edgy.. 6.10 .. Last time I did before replugging my usbhdd, is that I've made a 'prelink' .. Maybe that's causing the problem?

[11:36] <mabus> gnome_guy: thanks

[11:43] <Abst> Daviey: My resoloution is the same >_>
[11:43] <Abst> Daviey: Hold on, letme get a screenshot
[11:44] <Daviey> Abst, small fonts and menu's; does sound like high resolution
[11:44] <Abst> No
[11:44] <Abst> Its not all fonts
[11:44] <Abst> Just some fonts
[11:44] <Abst> IRC fonts are fine
[11:44] <Abst> But GDM ones arnt
[11:44] <Abst> Terminal ones are
[11:44] <SupremacyGnu> you guys got problems with your resolutions aswell?
[11:45] <Tatey> Hey, would anyone be aware of why /dev/mdX nodes aren't created for me on start-up?
=== jukka is now known as jops
[11:45] <SupremacyGnu> I just can't change to 1280x1024...
[11:45] <Daviey> Abst, hmm.  Sounds like fluxbox settings.  I don't think i can really help
[11:45] <Abst> Daviey: Its in GDM and gnome too..
[11:46] <Daviey> Abst, tight firewall won't allow me to recive stuff over IRC.  Have you tried the font setting in gnome?
[11:46] <Abst> Daviey: When I used GNOME I tried that, all the same as prior to nvidia
[11:47] <Joe_SWAU> Hi, I am trying to connect to my school wireless. It is WPA2 with AES authentication. The card I am using normally supports WEP, but I can get it working with WPA2-AES in windows.
[11:47] <LazyFrog> wait...
[11:47] <Daviey> Abst, what happens if you change your settings to use VESA rather than the nvidia driver?
[11:47] <LazyFrog> is that a windows problem?
[11:47] <LazyFrog> orr an ubuntu problem?
[11:47] <kmasta> evertime i start up firefox it doesn't dispaly the ubuntu page
[11:47] <Abst> Daviey: I dont know what VESA is
[11:47] <mcsmurf> that it works under Windows? :-D
[11:47] <kmasta> oop
[11:47] <mcsmurf> nice ;)
[11:47] <Abst> Daviey: Don't I need the nvidia one to use OpenGL?
[11:48] <kmasta> how do i make it so that every time i start up firefox it shows what i have set for the homepage, and not the ubuntu thing
=== Akebono is now known as Akebono89
[11:48] <PR006> go to the firefox settings
[11:48] <Daviey> Abst, the nvidia one would be better than VESA; the default one.  I'm just interested if the settings repair themselves if you change the driver
[11:48] <Abst> !vesa
[11:48] <ubotu> vesa is the default video driver if X can't find a better one. Also see !x
[11:48] <kmasta> pr006, yea i did that
[11:49] <Abst> Daviey: I know its my xorg.conf
[11:49] <LazyFrog> Joe_SWAU, Ubuntu's wirless network manager does not support WEP...
[11:49] <LazyFrog> *wireless
[11:49] <Abst> Daviey: If I use the pre-nvidia xorg.conf its fine
[11:49] <iter> vesa local bus kicks eisa's booty
[11:49] <Abst> Soon as I change em
[11:49] <PR006> kmasta, and you defined the start page?
[11:49] <kmasta> yep
[11:49] <Daviey> kmasta, in preferences
[11:49] <LazyFrog> Joe_SWAU, you need to download gnome-network-manager
[11:49] <Abst> Daviey: I'm saying the default one is fine
[11:49] <kmasta> Daviey, where in prefernces
[11:49] <Abst> Daviey: Its just when I do nvidia-xonfig
[11:49] <Daviey> Abst, did you install from the ubuntu packages or from nvidia's source?
[11:50] <Joe_SWAU> LazyFrog: I am using that. I am trying to connect with WPA2 and AES authentication.
[11:50] <mabus> how come on an install of ubuntu server, I never went through the step of adding users?
[11:50] <Abst> Daviey: Packages
[11:50] <kmasta> PR006, my homepage is set to google, but when I open firefox is shows an ubuntu page
[11:50] <mabus> I don't have any users on my new system.. can it be rescued?
[11:50] <bruenig> kmasta, open firefox, about:config, then put in home for the filter. Make sure your homepage is in the browser.startup.homepage and make sure the startup.homepage_override_url is not the ubuntu page
[11:50] <mcsmurf> mabus: are you sure that you do not have root?
[11:51] <LazyFrog> Joe_SWAU, I'm trying to solve the very same problem at home, but didn't get to that point yet... ubuntu is annoying, doesn't have the compiling tools installled
[11:51] <kmasta> about:config?
[11:51] <mabus> mcsmurf: yeah
[11:51] <bruenig> kmasta, put that in the addressbar or location bar or whatever they call it
[11:51] <Tatey> what's happened to the arch builds of the kernels in Edgy?
[11:51] <Flamekebab> Anyone know how to fix the flash-crash error in Edgy in Flock?
[11:51] <Daviey> Abst,  do you reckon your settings are out of range or something?  Are you using a decent nvidia card and monitor?  Are you using the default xorg.conf that the packages instaled?
[11:51] <Fastly> i'm getting the following during "sudo apt-get install proftpd": Setting up proftpd (1.3.0-9) ... Unknown terminal: gnome. Check the TERM environment variable. Also make sure that the terminal is defined in the terminfo database. Alternatively, set the TERMCAP environment variable to the desired. any ideas?
[11:52] <Abst> Daviey: Well, games worked fine on Windows and its a GeForce4 so I assume its good, I don't know what you mean by out of range and I am using the edefault.
[11:52] <kmasta> bruenig, ahhh, this is what I figure. the override is set to rv:1.8.0.7
[11:52] <bruenig> put the override to your homepage, that should fix it
[11:52] <Abst> Fastly: export TERM=xterm
[11:52] <Akebono89> Ever since i upgraded to edgy, non of my USB devices will work. anyone else getting this?
[11:52] <Intangir> on linux if i build an app, that dynamically links, with certain versions of libraries, and send the binary to someone else who has the same libraries but different versions
[11:52] <Intangir> they should be able to run the binary right?
[11:52] <Fastly> i'm connecting via ssh
[11:53] <Abst> Intangir: Yes
[11:53] <Intangir> this guy at work is telling me thats not the case, but im pretty sure it is
[11:53] <Daviey> Abst, i honestly have no idea then.  The default xorg.conf for mine worked fine.  Maybe somebody else can help debug it.   Did you try the sudo reconfigure .... that i posted further up?
[11:53] <Abst> Daviey: Ill try now
[11:53] <cratel-1> !cups
[11:53] <ubotu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWindows
[11:53] <mabus> how do I add users if it never prompted me to in install? can i rescue with the boot disk?
[11:54] <bruenig> kmasta, any confirmation on if that works?
[11:55] <kodat> hey anyone know command..i dunno where it is..to see what ip's are connecting in what order
[11:55] <kmasta> bruenig, yep
[11:55] <Daviey> mabus, can you get a console up?  ie Ctrl+Alt + F2
[11:55] <bruenig> ok because I was just guessing there
[11:55] <kmasta> bruenig, wasn't exactly what needt to be done, but you got me close enough
[11:56] <mabus> Daviey: yes
[11:56] <blazemonger> does anyone have any advice on beginning c programming?
[11:56] <phanter> hi there... anybody who wants to help me setting up LVM on my brand new Ubuntu server?
[11:56] <mabus> Daviey: but it only prompts to login and i never ste up a login
[11:56] <blazemonger> i want to become a c/c++ guru :)
[11:56] <Daviey> mabus, ahh... you don't have access to the root account! :(
[11:56] <phanter> blazemonger: I would start with a good book...
[11:56] <dnite> i'm just going through tweaking ubuntu and i see that both klogd and sysklogd are running as services.. what's the difference between these 2? and do i really need them both running?
[11:56] <blazemonger> so i can develop my own music software
[11:56] <mcsmurf> blazemonger: take your time...a lot of time!
[11:56] <blazemonger> phanter: and alot of weed?
[11:56] <mcsmurf> and for music software even more!
[11:57] <blazemonger> I have the time
[11:57] <youssef> hello  I just got a brand new N1 blekin wireless 802.11n card  does anybody know how to get it to work under ubuntu ???
[11:57] <mcsmurf> do you know what you are planning there ;D
[11:57] <phanter> blazemonger: and time... definitely time
[11:57] <blazemonger> i have experience in assembly language
[11:57] <mcsmurf> lot of hassle
[11:57] <blazemonger> yes
[11:57] <kmasta> what's the easiest way to upgrade to edgy if have have dapper installed right now and i'm using it
[11:57] <mabus> Daviey: correct
[11:57] <phanter> blazemonger: assembly is MUCHO different from c /c++ (especially from c++\)
[11:57] <Akebono89> Ever since i upgraded to edgy, non of my USB devices will work. anyone else getting this?
[11:57] <blazemonger> linux is much more of a development platform than windows is
[11:57] <mabus> Daviey: it never prompted me to set up any accounts whatsoever in the installer process
[11:57] <mabus> never set up a root password, or regular user
[11:58] <Daviey> mabus, i think the quickest way will be to re-install.  I'm surpised you weren't prompted.  Was it edgy or dapper?
[11:58] <blazemonger> ive noticed that..there's so much it's not even funny..it's like the developers of the first unix os were high as *#@& on ALOT of drugs
[11:58] <mabus> Daviey: dapper
[11:58] <blazemonger> since what sober person would put a game called dopewars in a operating system heheheh
[11:58] <phanter> anyway... I have a running ubuntu server and I need to combine a partition on /dev/hda3 with /dev/hdc, but I cannot figure out how it works (and internet does not give me the hints I am looking for :()
[11:58] <blazemonger> dopewars is my favorite game in the planet
[11:58] <Daviey> mabus, i't didn't even ask you to enter your name?
[11:59] <kmasta> !edgy
[11:59] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[11:59] <mabus> Daviey: no, it never brought me to that step of the installatoin
[11:59] <AlReece45> mabus: booting in recovery mode should automatically bring you to a root terminal where you can add users
[11:59] <Daviey> phanter, do you mean combine two harddisk to make one huge disk?
[11:59] <Vladaz> hello, does amarok work on ubuntu?
[11:59] <LjL> Vladaz: it is supposed to.
[11:59] <Akebono89> gah
[11:59] <Daviey> mabus, i really would install from scratch.  If it missed out the users, what else did it miss out?
[11:59] <phanter> Daviey: yes.... but it should also work to combine different partitions right?
[12:00] <mabus> AlReece45: I just booted in recuse mode and tried to add myself as a user, I don't know if that wrote it to disk or not though
[12:00] <youssef> hello  I just got a new blekin wireless N1  802.11n card  does anybody know how to get it to work under ubuntu ???
[12:00] <mabus> ill try now
[12:00] <blazemonger> the only thing i dont like about ubuntu is it's harder to have a fully existing gnome and kde development system
[12:00] <Daviey> phanter, look up LVM2
[12:00] <Vladaz> couse it shows splash and doesnt turn it on
[12:00] <Daviey> !lvm
[12:00] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[12:00] <rbil> Vladaz: most of it yes. Some scripts may not run as they are looking for a KDE environment
[12:00] <Tatey> any idea on why the /dev/mdX nodes aren't being created?
[12:00] <blazemonger> btw i'm somewhat of a newbie by the way folks
[12:00] <pkh> when I upgraded to edgy I noticed some artifacts around my cursor in single-monitor-mode (ati [Radeon Mobility M300]  on a dell d610 using fglrx) -- it was only a small glitch and didn't bother me too much until I got into the office and tried to use my second monitor -- the second monitor's cursor is just a large square glitch.  anyone have any ideas what might have changes in the update (kernel, driver, etc?)
[12:00] <Daviey> Installing dapper, resized a 160gig (130gig of data) to created a partition of 20 gig for ubuntu.  X has crashed midway through resizing.  I have left it 50 hours.  Any ideas what i should do?
[12:00] <phanter> Daviey: I installed it, but I do not fully understand the messages I get. I look them up via google, but those hints are not bringing me further
[12:01] <crass> blazemonger: I think that's a problem with binary distros in general (which tend to not install dev requirements by default)
