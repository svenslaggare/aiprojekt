[12:01] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: /target
[12:01] <rasman> odat, did that work?
[12:01] <morphish> eeww, my pkgcache.bin seems to have gotten hosed :( some day i will just disappear :/
[12:02] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : lol well ubuntu is too heavy for the regular linux guru : Its too simple that ot complicates things : no easy commanline utils/ configurators etc
[12:02] <odat> rasman, i can't find the deb file
[12:02] <rogue780> cpk1, thanks it works great now
[12:02] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : mount --bind /dev /target/dev
[12:02] <rasman> odat, I've got mine here but I don't know where to post it.
[12:02] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Well, the lamp install is excellent for running jinzora and stuff.    failed: Block Device Required
[12:03] <TLE> does anybody now how to fix a broken mpeg2 stream ?
[12:03] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : ps you must do this before you chroot /target ok
[12:03] <rasman> odat, the deb is located in the directory above the source code root
[12:03] <ElectricKetchup> Hey I just tried to install freeradius on my ubuntu server and when I run it, it gives me an error message.  Anyone have any ideas? rlm_eap: Failed to link EAP-Type/tls: rlm_eap_tls.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:03] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Let me reboot
[12:03] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : I need a bite to eat
[12:03] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup, You're missing a dependancy
[12:04] <rasman> odat, I am trying to send you a file but I have never done this before.
[12:04] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : If you're around in 20 mins bell me
[12:04] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: How do you reinstall whole system apt-get install ???????
[12:04] <ElectricKetchup> ^Ocean^: which one?
[12:04] <OllieD> tell me
[12:04] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: k
[12:04] <^Ocean^> what ever one provides rlm_eap_tls.so
[12:04] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : LOL I tried that using that guide it failed !
[12:04] <odat> rasman, can you send it email?
[12:04] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : LOL I tried that using that guide it failed ! That caused me no end of headaches !
[12:04] <qmf> if you upgrade from dapper to edgy from a fresh dapper install, is it exactly the same as using a fresh edgy install?
[12:05] <bradley> preaction-m, could it be that because edgy automounts it is mounting before the application is finished?
[12:05] <rasman> odat, sure, I think these irc chats are logged so obviscate your email address
[12:05] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : In the end I installed to a spare disk and copied the new install to the raid
[12:05] <ElectricKetchup> ^Ocean^: can't find that file with the search engine on http://packages.ubuntu.com/
[12:05] <odat> rasman, mrwislr (at) gmail (dot) com
[12:05] <dfcarney> qmf: it should be pretty close, why?
[12:05] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Is there a way to do an upgrade install with the newer version?
[12:06] <qmf> dfcarney: just wondering if it sets up aiglx all ok with an upgrade.
[12:06] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup: this may be of use
[12:06] <^Ocean^> http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2006/02/msg01036.html
[12:06] <imme-emosol> If these irc-chats are logged, then how do I change my hostname?
[12:06] <Vspirit> how do I enable backspace to get firefox in ubuntu go back one page in history ?
[12:06] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Ever have one of those days where everthing breaks, even my juicer went.  I am almost afraid to fix this :-)
[12:07] <dfcarney> qmf: hmmm.  well, i don't know about aiglx in particular, but if you upgrade that package manually then it should give you an option to keep your current config file (or upgrade to the package maintainer's version)
[12:07] <ElectricKetchup> is there a third-part apt repository I can use that has a working version of freeradius?
[12:07] <Vspirit> got it.
[12:07] <yintelike> Q  in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf  i set  requirepassword=false  but it still doesn't let me login without asking for a password on a passwordless account    what's the fix ?
[12:07] <^Ocean^> imme-emosol, get a new isp
[12:07] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: How is it not working?
[12:08] <ElectricKetchup> cafuego: missing files
[12:08] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup: did you not read the link i just sent you ?
[12:08] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: such as?
[12:08] <yintelike> that is    PasswordRequired=false
[12:08] <^Ocean^> Download the source
[12:08] <^Ocean^> from the website
[12:08] <mordof> does anyone here have stepmania working? i've tried to use the linux binary for stepmania but it just crashes :S
[12:08] <ElectricKetchup> well, I'd like to just install a package from a repository so I don't have to manually maintain it
[12:08] <LineOf7s> Howdy people.  Is it possible to set up (root) password protection on arbitrary actions?  I have a particular application I don't want my end-users to be able to close.
[12:09] <ElectricKetchup> I mean, that's the whole reason I installed ubuntu instead of slackware
[12:09] <intelikey> anyone know about gdm issue ?
[12:09] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup, perhapys freeradius-ldap might be it
[12:09] <qmf> dfcarney: well i'm upgrading now, it didn't offer anything like that. so i guess that means it just bumps everything up to what it should be? we'll see.. it's just i had trouble with beryl in my last install so i just set up xgl. i think i was doing something wrong before tho
[12:09] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: afaik, stuff like eap/tls isn't enabled by default.
[12:09] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup: apt-cache search freeradius
[12:09] <imme-emosol> okay, thanks ^Ocean^. Not an option though.
[12:09] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: if you need ldap support, you indeed need to install freeradius-ldap
[12:09] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: run it as 'root' with an init script
[12:09] <ElectricKetchup> ^Ocean^: I searched on packages.ubuntu.com and the file isn't in their edgy repository
[12:10] <^Ocean^> imme-emosol, You could get a vhost and a bnc server
[12:10] <ElectricKetchup> cafuego: I've already installed freeradius-ldap
[12:10] <odat> rasman, give me a couple minutes to try the new driver
[12:10] <LineOf7s> Thanks dfcarney - I'll look into that.  :o)
[12:10] <^Ocean^> ElectricKetchup, Then you are going to have to install the package from source
[12:10] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: Car to enlightent me on which file you're after?
[12:10] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: I'm sure it sounds easy, but you'll need to read up a little bit on adding a startup/shutdown script in /etc/init.d
[12:10] <imme-emosol> ^Ocean^, I'll look that up, thanks.
[12:10] <intelikey> <whispers>  gdm...  anyone ?
[12:10] <ElectricKetchup> cafuego: rlm_eap_tls.so
[12:11] <LineOf7s> dfcarney:  You mean the whole update-rc.d thing?
[12:11] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: read up on "linux run levels"
[12:11] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: yeah, that's related
[12:11] <avista> i'm getting ready to upgrade to feisty
[12:11] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: Yes. You need to fetch the source package and edit debian/rules (it's commented) then recompile with tls support.
[12:11] <avista> but i want to resolve some outstanding issues w/ edgy
[12:11] <^Ocean^> is feisty > edgy ?
[12:11] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: 'apt-get source freeradius'
[12:11] <avista> i have some errors from sudo apt-get upgrade
[12:11] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: basically, you want a startup/shutdown script in the correct rc.d directory that will startup/shutdown whatever program when you boot/reboot/etc.
[12:11] <avista> may I post them or PM them to some one
[12:11] <Deep> Gonatt :)
[12:11] <LineOf7s> dfcarney:  mmkay - thanks fore the headsup.  Does it change anything if it's an app in gnome I'm talking about, rather than generally?
[12:12] <LineOf7s> -e
[12:12] <sigp239> Right here --> https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/web-browsing.html -- it says to install "totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin" but there is NO SUCH PACKAGE
[12:12] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: Your mileage may vary; I did that last night on debian and ended up with missing symbols and freeradius crashing.
[12:12] <ElectricKetchup> cafuego: if I install it like that, will I be able to upgrade the package?
[12:12] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: well, you'll want to make sure that it starts after Gnome starts...  but i'm not terribly sure about programs running in X.
[12:12] <nolimitsoya> what do i need to display japaneese text in firefox?
[12:12] <jerp> I've been to line 2 in my sources.list file and nothing is there, so how do I clear this error?  E: Malformed line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-universe.list (dist parse)
[12:13] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: Yes, building with the deb build tools will create a package you can rebuild and upgrade at any time.
[12:13] <LineOf7s> dfcarney:  Aaah.  Yes, this is the problem I'm having.  Still, you've given me a head start.  :o)
[12:13] <avista> can anyone help me?
[12:13] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: Another way may be to setup a globally-readable gnome startup file and (somehow) force all users to use it.
[12:13] <intelikey> jerp that means first non-blank uncommented line
[12:13] <ElectricKetchup> cafuego: how hard would it be to setup my own repository with just one package?
[12:14] <imme-emosol> Is there anyone in here also experiencing difficulties with keyboard-layout in 6.10 ?
[12:14] <intelikey> jerp that means second non-blank uncommented line     hehe you said line 2
[12:14] <LineOf7s> dfcarney:  Of course, it's that 'somehow' that brings me here.  :o)
[12:14] <x-faktor> os it normal that when i install ubuntu on vmware, i got an scsi virtual hard disk by default?
[12:14] <cafuego> ElectricKetchup: pretty trivial... I use Seveas 'falcon' to manage my repo.
[12:14] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: heh.
[12:14] <SoulOrb> So, is there a way to recover my dapper drake install, or should I just start from scratch.
[12:14] <intelikey> SoulOrb botched upgrade ?
[12:14] <dfcarney> LineOf7s: Well, sorry that I can't help you anymore.  I know about setting up daemons, but not X apps.
[12:15] <AnthonyG> :|
[12:15] <Onofrio> anybody know the option for  wget -nd  ?  http://www.gnu.org     to exrtact  ------------>only file *.txt ?<-----------------------
[12:15] <AnthonyG> Hello everyone
[12:15] <webmaren> i can't get ndiswrapper-1.8 to work
[12:15] <SoulOrb> intelikey: No, I just rebooted and now it hangs.  I am not sure what happened.
[12:15] <webmaren> running edgy
[12:15] <imme-emosol> Or does anyone know of a way to turn off those darn default dead keys in 6.10 ?
[12:15] <SoulOrb> intelikey: It has been running for days, just sits there and runs my vmware boxes.
[12:15] <LineOf7s> dfcarney:  No no - sometimes one just needs another pointer as to what to jam into Google's sometimes selfish craw.  Thankyou anyway.
[12:16] <intelikey> SoulOrb hangs where ?   give me pertanant info.
[12:16] <SoulOrb> On the Ubunto splash screen
[12:16] <SoulOrb> intelikey: Splash screen
[12:16] <imme-emosol> gconf maybe?
[12:16] <intelikey> SoulOrb grub splash or gdm splash or gnome splash ?
[12:17] <BoRaT> imme-emesol: try using U.S.English
[12:17] <SoulOrb> intelikey: I just did a reiserfsck and it is clean.
[12:17] <jerp> intelikey, this is my line 2 in the source.list: deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted  _ Nothing about edgy-universe (if that is a clue)
[12:17] <SoulOrb> intelikey: On the grub splash, since there is no display of anything being mounted etc.
[12:18] <intelikey> SoulOrb sounds like a kernel upgrade and the initramfs is failing... maybe.     try other kernel choices.
[12:18] <imme-emosol> BoRaT, I did to no avail.
[12:19] <BoRaT> imme-emosol: i use U.S.Egnglish, which has no dead-keys
[12:19] <SoulOrb> intelikey: I guess what I am saying, is I don't know what to apt-get, on a amd64 system, to reinstall stuff.  Plus it gives me a "public key is not avaliable".  I am sitll new to Ubuntu
[12:19] <intelikey> jerp k    why don't you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and let me look.
[12:19] <odat> rasman,  ?
[12:19] <jerp> ok
[12:20] <imme-emosol> BoRaT, It's called U.S. English Alternative International (former us_intl)   So, that states nothing about dead keys, whereas U.S. English (with dead keys) does.

[12:22] <grndslm_> is my hard drive about to crash?
[12:22] <BoRaT> :P
[12:22] <imme-emosol> BoRaT, JaY, it's working.

[12:29] <r00t_> i have to start my webserver soon as posible :(
[12:30] <haxality> it works fine usually, but sometimes it stops working and no matter how many times I reboot, re modprobe ipw2100, ifup/ifdown it, it won't work unless I reset my router
[12:30] <SoulOrb> Is there no official recovery method.  I mean for all I know it is just grub got scrambled?
[12:30] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : whats that line output as per df -k
[12:30] <haxality> anyone?
[12:30] <intelikey> r00t_ post your error message

[12:31] <r00t_> intelikey, there is no error . just php doesnt genarate page.
[12:31] <intelikey> SoulOrb i gave you the official recovery method        did you try to boot with another kernel ?
[12:31] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : mine looks like this udev                     10240       120     10120   2% /dev

[12:33] <tlisboa> iter: i'll try this !! thanks a lot
[12:33] <SoulOrb> I thought there is just a way to reinstall packages.
[12:33] <apokryphos> tlisboa: then sudo umount /media/hdc1 && mount /media/hdc1    (note the last part as user, not root)
[12:33] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : in that case : forget mounting /dev/ and chroot just check /target/var/log/bootlog
[12:33] <SoulOrb> intelikey: Before I try what you said, I simply need to know how to do the chroot.
[12:33] <bradley> how do i change the name of a usbdisk?
[12:34] <syyd> anyone using grip?
[12:34] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : see what process  it hangs at and if there are any errors
[12:34] <syyd> any supporting pkgs to go with that?
[12:34] <we2by> grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:35] <we2by> how do I fix that?
[12:35] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Once I try what you say, and mount /proc to /target/proc I cannot chroot then.
[12:35] <apokryphos> we2by: install the package that has that file?
[12:35] <intelikey> SoulOrb sudo chroot /target
[12:35] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : as i said FORGET all that we talked about just view that file
[12:35] <we2by> apokryphos, dunno what package that has that file

[12:36] <AnthonyG> Bah, Luck is not on my side today , My KernelBin is turning into spagetti due to so many modem drivers.
[12:36] <aleka> budluva, thanks a lot
[12:37] <haxality> also, I have a question
[12:37] <haxality> I found a thread on ubuntuforums.org that fixed my problem
[12:37] <haxality> by adding a line to my kernel boot params
[12:37] <intelikey> r00t_ the install of php was botched according to your pastebin   "error processing runit"    seems the setup script "runit" failed.  that's what you need to fix   and the reason was a configurations error on "/etc/ssh/sshd_config: line 73: Bad configuration option: AcceptEnv"  so fix  the sshd.config and try again
[12:37] <haxality> but I accidentally lost it
[12:37] <thiago_> iter, apokryphos, i have tried s/defaults/defaults,user and it still showing ownership only to the root user
[12:37] <budluva> aleka, np
[12:37] <SoulOrb> sec.
[12:37] <haxality> it was something like reboot = h
[12:37] <haxality> does anyone know what I'm talking about?
[12:37] <apokryphos> thiago_: I realised your fstab entry didn't specify what FS it was. Is that right?
[12:38] <iter> thiago_: you remounted as user and not root?
[12:38] <r00t_> intelikey,  i fixed that and i installed it again .
[12:38] <intelikey> r00t_ new errors ?
[12:38] <r00t_> yeah php wont show
[12:38] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : any dice ?
[12:38] <ubd> hello is there a network monitor in ubuntu?
[12:38] <iter> ubd: ntop or bmon ?
[12:38] <r00t_> yeah when i use http://localhost/index.php . its tell me to save
[12:38] <ubd> iter: lemme check them out
[12:39] <reiki> ok this may sound odd, but I have Dapper on sda1 and Edgy on hda1 (SATA for Dapper, EIDE for Edgy). I find now I always boot Edgy. Is there an easy way to just SWITCH them?
[12:39] <apokryphos> ubd: knemo's quite nice
[12:39] <intelikey> r00t_ and " please hurry up "   is worth the paper it's written on.... being electronic communication that means nothing at all.
[12:39] <apokryphos> ubd: might nto be worth getting all the kdelibs in just for that though. /me shrugs
[12:39] <iter> apokryphos: have you used rrd/cacti ?
[12:39] <AnthonyG> Erm , The Martian Lucent drivers are only for DSP modems aren't they?
[12:39] <apokryphos> iter: nope
[12:39] <r00t_> intelikey,  i didnt get you
[12:40] <ubd> i want to view connection types and origin pids
[12:40] <intelikey> insisting that you are more important and should have favor is rude r00t_           understand that one ?
[12:40] <r00t_> yes
[12:41] <chewy> i gots a problem with php/apache2
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> what do i need to display japaneese text in firefox?
[12:41] <chewy> when it loads index.php my browser just tries to save a phtml file
[12:41] <bigfuzzyjesus> does anyone know the linux equivilent to ipconfig
[12:41] <r00t_> chesty,  its tell you to download the .php page
[12:41] <r00t_> same prob
[12:41] <chewy> anyone know how i can get it to display?
[12:41] <levander> Any idea why xvidtune is not letting me move the desktop around on my monitor?
[12:41] <poolkey172> bigfuxxyjesus : igconfig
[12:41] <apokryphos> !jp
[12:41] <ubotu>  #ubuntu-jp  #kubuntu-jp 
[12:41] <poolkey172> bigfuxxyjesus : ifconfig
[12:42] <levander> It could be because I already have a modeline for the resolution I'm running?
[12:42] <thiago__> sorry iter apokryphos ther power has gone right now and I didn't see your answers...
[12:42] <apokryphos> thiago_: I realised your fstab entry didn't specify what FS it was. Is that right?
[12:42] <thiago__> apokryphos: it specifies.. /dev/hdc1       /media/hdc1     ext3    defaults,user   0       2
[12:42] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Just trying it now
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> apokryphos, that didnt help me. ;) i want to be able tosee japaneese text in firefox instead of scramble. i dont speak it myself
[12:42] <apokryphos> thiago_: ok, so sudo umount /media/hdc1 now
[12:42] <thiago__> i've just copied it from there..
[12:42] <thiago__> all right
[12:42] <graft> so, spamassassin isn't doing it for me - what are my options?
[12:43] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : just do tail -10 /target/var/log/boot
[12:43] <apokryphos> thiago__: and now (as user) mount /media/hdc1
[12:43] <thiago__> ok
[12:43] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : the same again for  tail -10 /target/var/log/messages
[12:43] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Had to shell in.
[12:43] <chisefu> how do i hack
[12:43] <grndslm> Renan_s2:  there are a few "ide: failed opcode was: unknown" && "hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }" , etc. commands at the end of dmesg
[12:43] <AnthonyG> XD
[12:44] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya: I've never used locales but I'd venture the guess that you'd need to get the japanese fonts
[12:44] <apokryphos> !info mozilla-firefox-locale-ja-jp
[12:44] <ubotu> mozilla-firefox-locale-ja-jp: Mozilla Firefox Japanese language/region package. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0~rc3ubuntu1-1 (edgy), package size 175 kB, installed size 820 kB
[12:44] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya: perhaps that
[12:44] <intelikey> poolkey172 i don't think he's ever getting to the mounting fs stage   from what i gathered.
[12:44] <AnthonyG> chisefu: Now that sir , Is a general question XD
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> !locale
[12:44] <ubotu> To set up and configure your locales, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf
[12:44] <r00t_> ok reinstall apache 2 and php5 and everything lamme restart
[12:44] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : intellikey thanks for that info
[12:44] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya: no, see what ubotu said
[12:44] <graft> man beryl is so cool
[12:44] <thiago__> apokryphos: i've done and still showing root as owner
[12:44] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: I am trying intelikeys suggesting sudo apt-get -u --reinstall --fix-missing install  $(dpkg -S LC_MESSAGES | cut -d: -f1 | tr ', ' '\n' | sort -u)
[12:44] <apokryphos> thiago__: as owner of what? The files in that partition?
[12:45] <AnthonyG> Would the SmartLink Driver work with an Agere Systems 56K PCI Soft Modem (V.92)?
[12:45] <nolimitsoya> apokryphos, i did. just want to check it out more, before ditching stuff i know nothing about intomy system :)
[12:45] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : woah okie dokie
[12:45] <apokryphos> thiago__: if you definitely mounted it as user, then those files genuinely have root permissions. You'd have to chown to change that
[12:45] <graft> still working on that, AnthonyG?
[12:45] <thiago__> apokryphos: when I go to the permissions on this device icon it shows root as the owner...
[12:45] <SoulOrb> poolkey
[12:45] <AnthonyG> graft: Yes , Unfortunately :(
[12:45] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Ok, that finished.  HAd to reinstall dpkg.
[12:45] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya: well there's plenty of information given about it there. There's more info in packages on /msg ubotu packages
[12:45] <KnowledgEngi> !midi
[12:45] <ubotu> Trouble playing MIDI files? Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
[12:45] <ubd> where are you from soulorb
[12:45] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : cool
[12:46] <chewy> anyone competent enough to help me?
[12:46] <AnthonyG> graft: My Kernel Module bin is turning into an abyss of neverending spaghetti and torment.
[12:46] <apokryphos> !anyone
[12:46] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:46] <we2by> looks like azureus is working fine here :) still haven't crashed yet
[12:46] <we2by> :=)
[12:46] <thiago__> apokryphos: i'm wondering if I could write a fstab entry in order to everytime I boot up the system and this device mounts with my user ownership...
[12:46] <SoulOrb> ubd: Halifax, Canada
[12:46] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : sounds like a very sick filesystem there
[12:46] <AnthonyG> chewy: Word your questions more carefully :)
[12:46] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: ok, how can I reinstall grub?
[12:46] <intelikey> thiago__ you can chown the mounted mountpoint
[12:46] <apokryphos> thiago__: you wouldn't have to do anything else, after what's done above. It just sounds like all the files in there are genuinely owned by root
[12:47] <nolimitsoya> apokryphos, but it doesnt give me clue as to wether it will solve my problem, and i definatly doesnt say anything about wether its the best solution :)
[12:47] <chewy> anthony6: when i load a php file from my webserver all that happens is firefox asking where i would want to save the phtml file
[12:47] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : this sounds quite serious
[12:47] <chisefu> where did libc5 go
[12:47] <apokryphos> nolimitsoya: well, it obviously sounds pretty close to it. Did the page not give you the more info you wanted?
[12:47] <chewy> anthony6: i have the phpmod5, php5 packages installed
[12:47] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : It might be cheaper to archive your data off that disk and just do a fresh install ?
[12:47] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Well, strange thing is that I was rescueing my vmware and I think that process jumped out of hte container and tried to frig with my host part.
[12:48] <AnthonyG> chewy: That sounds more like a Firefox problem , Did you try a different install of Firefox?
[12:48] <AnthonyG> chewy: O
[12:48] <chewy> anthony6: i tried opera and mozilla
[12:48] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: I can lose everything on there if I had to.  I might just go that anyway, good suggestion.
[12:48] <AnthonyG> chewy: I've had it do that to me with XML files before.
[12:48] <chewy> anthony6: it is also coming up on google as a common problem in edgy
[12:48] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : vmware oh ic : and u had to use a physical disk instead of a virtual one :p
[12:49] <xarq> how do I change my keymap to dvorak?
[12:49] <AnthonyG> chewy: I don't see how Ubuntu would effect the rendering of a webpage.
[12:49] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Well, once I tried to use my virtual, it frigged my physical.  Wierd.
[12:49] <Veljko> hi eweryone... Noob here... Thing is my Networ Administration tool keeps crashing. I configured it one time, to a profile widouth wireless network. Now, when i try to start it, to change a profile, it crashes (bug report tool)... any ideas?
[12:49] <chewy> its an apache2/php problem
[12:49] <chewy> not ubuntu
[12:50] <chewy> evidently the ubuntu guys didn't do it right so it has to be done by hand
[12:50] <intelikey> AnthonyG chewy  flash?
[12:50] <chewy> php
[12:50] <AnthonyG> chewy: Don't blame the all powerful Ubuntu creators >:(
[12:50] <chewy> anthony6: well it ran fine on debian
[12:50] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : thats interesting maybe the OS routed through the devices and out : But thats highly enlikely as vmware is contained in its own BIOS machine : weird dude
[12:51] <intelikey> chewy php version maybe ?
[12:51] <jerp> 'intelikey, amaZingly_ it failed.  I still get the E: Malformed line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-universe.list (dist parse)  _with it being that I will look in the 'sources.list.d' folder and change the 'edgy-universe.list' file something else and see if I can run it again.   Good idea?

[12:51] <we2by> what is the systemtray called in ubuntu?
[12:51] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Yep, that is what I thought.
[12:51] <AnthonyG> I doubt my question will be answered , All this driver loading is bound to kill something.
[12:51] <synic> we2by: notification area
[12:51] <poolkey172> SoulOrb : lol : I want to know that answer myself : Me thinks Intellikey is the dpkg-guru
[12:51] <intelikey> jerp yes
[12:52] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: Like in gentoo you can do a emerge world, and it reinsalls everyintg
[12:52] <jerp> 'intelikey, yeah, it's worth a shot I would say
[12:52] <Veljko> well... will reinstl ubuntu... thanks anyway
[12:52] <SoulOrb> intelikey: That finished by the way, and it did not do much.  I removed and reinstalled grub.

[12:55] <poolkey172> lol @ borat you sure didnt write those flah pieces yourself ?
[12:55] <intelikey> SoulOrb i still think your initramfs is failing you...  i could be wrong.    but that command finishing means that the system should run once booted.

[01:03] <i7ch> qt-based apps (wengophone) are launching w3m(!) as a default browser. this is preventing me from registering, since wengophone depends on a captcha mechanism for registartion. any idea how to change the qt default browser, when i don't even have kde installed?

[01:04] <Rob-West> Ubuntu Edgy rocks
[01:04] <ubd> apokryphos: i want to disable my ntfs drives mounted automatically. how will i do that
[01:04] <i7ch> ubd, you can delete them from /etc/fstab
[01:05] <ubd> i7ch:  theres no line in fstab about them
[01:05] <poolkey172> ubd : edit /etc/fstab
[01:05] <ubd> no line in fstab
[01:05] <i7ch> ubd, reeeeeeally? can you paste it somewhere in pastebin, and the output of the "mount" command?
[01:05] <caglar> hello, how can I make my soundcart support more than one program at one time?
[01:05] <Rob-West> can i install Amarok in Ebuntu Edgy
[01:05] <SoulOrb> intelikey: Nope, did not work.  Oh well, see that is why it is good to run everything in vmware.
[01:06] <i7ch> Rob-West, yeah
[01:06] <caglar> I can only use one program which uses sounds
[01:06] <caglar> though my sound card has alsa drivers loaded
[01:06] <birdfish> Does anyone happen to know of another project like the Hula-Project but that is in stable developement?
[01:06] <reiki> ok this may sound odd, but I have Dapper on sda1 and Edgy on hda1 (SATA for Dapper, EIDE for Edgy). I find now I always boot Edgy. Is there an easy way to just SWITCH them?
[01:07] <grndslm_> reiki:  do you just want to change the default boot order?
[01:07] <reiki> grndslm, no actually I want to put Edgy on the SATA drive and Dapper on the IDE drive
[01:07] <ubd> here it ishttp://pastebin.mozilla.org/1618
[01:07] <jerp> intelikey,  is there a clue to what to look for on this vext error?..............>   Reading package lists...

[01:08] <poolkey172> what do you guys use for syncing calenders with microsoft outlook or vice versea ?
[01:08] <jerp> scratch vext and insert next
[01:08] <vladi111> hi if I wanted to record a movie of my desktop what would be the best way to do it? As a flash movie, ogg etc?
[01:09] <grndslm_> vladilll:  i'd be interested to know that also
[01:09] <Some_Person> I have an ADSL modem hooked up to my computer (even though it wont work until friday) and i want to know if it'll work in Ubuntu
[01:10] <reiki> Some_Person, how is it connected to your computer
[01:10] <Some_Person> Ethernet port
[01:10] <Rob-West> what package of Amarok do i download
[01:10] <malakhi> ubd, you can comment out/delete the ntfs lines, or you can add 'noauto' to the options field in /etc/fstab
[01:10] <xkenneth> does anyone have particular experience with VMware and USB devices?
[01:10] <metatecque> Ok, Here is a legit question that I think has a simple answer - Why when I run "lspci -v" all of my hardware shows that it is only available to root
[01:10] <reiki> Some_Person, ok it should be fine. The ADSL should be a stand alone device and it
[01:11] <ubd> malakhi doesnt "#" mean ignore?
[01:11] <Some_Person> do i need any weirdo drivers to make it work?
[01:11] <reiki> xkenneth, not in Edgy but I hook up a smart card reqader through USB in my DApper install running XP in a VM
[01:11] <reiki> Some_Person, you shouldn't
[01:11] <Some_Person> my ethernet thingy is "NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller" according to windows
[01:12] <Some_Person> do i need nvidia's driver?
[01:12] <malakhi> ubd, yes. but ubuntu uses the UUIDs instead of the /dev node for devices. The '# /dev/hdc1', etc is a comment telling you which UUID goes with which node
[01:12] <reiki> Some_Person, shouldn't matter. If you connect to the modem through Ethernet then the modem has already done all the work and Ubuntu should see it just fine
[01:12] <vladi111> Some_Person:  you probably have the same mboard as me :-)
[01:12] <xkenneth> reiki, I can't seem to see any USB devices in 6.10, should I downgrade to 6.06?
[01:13] <Some_Person> do you have an emachines?
[01:13] <ubd> malakhi, will i change the "default" to "no auto"?
[01:13] <reiki> xkenneth, did you enable the VM to use USB in VMWare? I seem to recall having to check a box to get it working
[01:13] <xkenneth> reiki, where exactly do you do that?
[01:14] <ubd> o oh.. i see now.. sry for bothering
[01:14] <Some_Person> also, i've read that there is something called "Goobuntu"; does it actually exist?
[01:14] <reiki> xkenneth, in the menu bar of VMWare at the top... to the right (trying to remember this... don't have it running at the moment) should be a drop down
[01:14] <malakhi> ubd, no. leave 'defaults' in there. just add ',noauto' (all one word, note the comma) after the 'gid=46' in the options field.
[01:14] <Rob-West> http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Download
[01:14] <haxality> Some_Person: yes, it is google's private customization of ubuntu
[01:14] <grndslm_> now...here's a real question:  how do  i downgrade a package?
[01:14] <Rob-West> which one of these do i download if im using Ubuntu
[01:14] <haxality> Some_Person: used exclusively in their offices
[01:14] <malakhi> ubd, defaults includes some other options you'll still want active
[01:15] <ubd> malakhi i just realized the uuids :d
[01:15] <ubd> :D
[01:15] <malakhi> :)
[01:15] <grndslm_> now...here's a real question:  how do  i downgrade a package?
[01:15] <vladi111> grndslm: http://wolphination.com/linux/2006/06/30/how-to-record-videos-of-your-desktop/
[01:16] <grndslm_> vladi111:  thanks
[01:16] <malakhi> ubd, i just modified your pastebin to show you what it should look like
[01:16] <xkenneth> reiki, when you go to your VM settings, do you see the USB controller in that list along with the processor/hard drives, etc?
[01:17] <Shaba1> Hello ladies and gentlemen. I need some serious help
[01:17] <ubd> oh. now i understand malakhi thhanks
[01:17] <malakhi> ubd, no problem
[01:17] <Shaba1> My non-profit is getting a donation of 7 machines with unbuntu on them
[01:17] <reiki> xkenneth, I believe so.... I really don't remember. the USB...... bah... don't remember. But there IS a drop down for enabling devices in the VM right at the top of VMWare
[01:17] <Shaba1> The problem is I have a windwow 2000/98 network
[01:17] <Shaba1> I know nothing about linux
[01:18] <Rob-West> ill take one of them
[01:18] <hikenboot>  anyone know how to enable debug startup mode on dhcp3-server?
[01:18] <ctkroeke1> Shaba1: what kid of machines are they
[01:18] <reiki> Shaba1, it won't be a problem. This is not spooky... it's friendly
[01:18] <xkenneth> reiki, right of course, but I can't get mine to populate even though I can see the devices through lsb and /proc/bus/usb
[01:18] <lullabud> Shaba1:  well, ubuntu is the right distro for your entry into the better world of operating systems. ;-)
[01:18] <xkenneth> reiki, lusb*
[01:18] <xkenneth> reiki, lsusb*
[01:18] <ctkroeke1> Shaba1: are they new, what kind of CPU Ram, etc.
[01:18] <ubd> well i just install knemo but how will i run it?
[01:18] <Shaba1> I DO NOT want to have to change over my whole network just becasue these IDIOTS that are using my computer lab do not like the speed of the 98 computers I am using
[01:19] <reiki> xkenneth, ok.... not sure I can be of further help. Been a while since I did this
[01:19] <mordof> Shaba1: lol
[01:19] <xkenneth> reiki, thanks for your time
[01:19] <Shaba1> ctkroeke1 are you kidding. These people are like "hey they are only 2 year old so they should work"
[01:19] <Shaba1> We are talking about some REALLY non techical people here.
[01:19] <mordof> Shaba1: i'm on ubuntu, my server is win2k.. there are no problems with hooking them up on the same network
[01:19] <Rob-West> Shabal ill take one of them Linux boxes
[01:19] <ctkroeke1> Shaba1: k, just checking, go ubuntu
[01:19] <reiki> Shaba1, my ubuntu box is on a windows network. It's really not a problem and it found the shared drives and stuff on the windows machines just fine
[01:19] <lullabud> Shaba1:  by "98 computers" do you mean windows 98?
[01:20] <Music_Shuffle> Most likely. ;P
[01:20] <ubd> apokryphos: how will i run knemo?
[01:20] <reiki> 98 is no longer supported. You will be assimilated
[01:20] <Shaba1> I have a Ethernet network using UTP cable operating at 100 mbps
[01:20] <lullabud> reiki:  on top of that, linux has everything 98 has to offer, and more.
[01:20] <ctkroeke1> I ran Beryl on a new machine today, really sweet
[01:20] <apokryphos> ubd: it's a daemon; configure it through kcontrol. Though I should note, it doesn't give greatly complex information. Just basics
=== BoRaT is now known as B0RAT
[01:21] <DarkMageZ> lullabud, 98 ran better on lower end machines.
[01:21] <ctkroeke1> wonder if it's much diff from comiz
[01:21] <mordof> Shaba1: you should have no problems hooking it all up
[01:21] <xkenneth> Anyone know VMWare fairly well?
[01:21] <jerp> heck, I'm stumped on this one
[01:21] <Shaba1> Everying is connected to 3 cisco catalyst 3500 fast ethernet switches.
[01:21] <reiki> lullabud, are you kidding?  It has way more than windows. :)   ok... except for some stuff that will ONLY run in windows but I've gotten around all but ONE of those for myself
[01:21] <ubd> apokryphos:  kcontrol?
[01:21] <dm> how do i run a SH script???
[01:21] <Shaba1> The master switch is then connected to a 100mbps Nic on my win2k server machine
[01:21] <lullabud> DarkMageZ:  how low end are you talking about?  i've run linux on some pretty low end machines.
[01:21] <ctkroeke1> dm: sh script
[01:21] <dm> ctkroekel hmm it wont run
[01:22] <Shaba1> That nic has and non routable ip address
[01:22] <lullabud> reiki:  i installed windows 98 the other day and it was a nightmare since auto-updates aren't working and drivers are hard to find, so i totally agree.
[01:22] <mordof> Shaba1: is there an actual problem that you're having hooking these comps up? not really sure where you're going with this..
[01:22] <DarkMageZ> lullabud, windows 98 ran ok on a p1 @ 166mhz with 32mb with an ok gui. can linux compete with that?
[01:22] <ctkroeke1> dm: right click on it and under permissions check if its executable and that u have permissions to run it
[01:22] <dm> dm@dm-laptop:~/Desktop/banshee-0.9.11.1$ sh install-sh
[01:22] <dm> install-sh: no input file specified.
[01:22] <poolkey172> Guys what do u use for syncing calenders with microsoft outlook or vice versea ?
[01:22] <Shaba1> The external nick on that machine is connected to a cisco router that is connected to our ASDL line
[01:22] <grndslm_> dm:  try "./<filename>"
[01:22] <lullabud> DarkMageZ:  yeah, it can.  i think linux runs better on slower machines than windows does.
[01:23] <grndslm_> without the "s
[01:23] <Shaba1> the server also runs my firewall software and is the domain PDC
[01:23] <ctkroeke1> dm: yep, what grndlslm said
[01:23] <mordof> .....
[01:23] <dm> grndslm_ no input file specified
[01:23] <lullabud> Shaba1:  so far i'm not seeing anything that would be prohibitive to linux functioning in that environment.
[01:23] <grndslm_> dm:  are you using sudo
[01:23] <poolkey172> DarkImage : Its a pity that that p1 32meg of ram stick needs a graphics card
[01:23] <grndslm_> or sudo -s?
[01:23] <DarkMageZ> lullabud, which livecd distro would demonstrate what you're saying? don't forget it needs a browser
[01:23] <mordof> lullabud: yeah i told him that about 4 times.. i don't think he's listening to responses
[01:23] <mordof> lullabud: he just keeps talkin about his setup
[01:23] <dm> grndslm_ triend with and without
[01:23] <Shaba1> so all the machines in the lab connect for authentication to that win2k server. That is how people get to the desktop
[01:24] <grndslm_> dm:  i dunno then
[01:24] <poolkey172> DarkImage : 5 years ago I buildt a custom distro for an embedded system with 32Meg of DISK space : it's still up today
[01:24] <dm> grndslm_ it said i could run the install-sh  file.
[01:24] <malakhi> dm, just out of curiosity, why are you trying to use a shell script to install banshee?
[01:24] <mordof> Shaba1: so all your client machines login remotely?
[01:24] <Shaba1> I have 7 admin office machine that I have not put Group policies on so they do not have to sign into the domain to get to their desktop
[01:24] <Zeman> hello
[01:24] <Shaba1> Clera now
[01:24] <dm> Malakhi, because the one from the repos is an old one, unless they have a wierd way of counting
[01:25] <Shaba1> If y remotely you mean outside our network or building no.
[01:25] <lullabud> mordof:  maybe he's drunk?
[01:25] <dm> malakhi are you familiar with banshee?
[01:25] <peanutb> my laptop has edgy on it. It hibernated for no apparent reason and now stalls at startup after fsck for an unknown reason
[01:25] <mordof> lullabud: lol
[01:25] <poolkey172> cating proc info : model name      : VIA Samuel 2 : cpu MHz         : 531.821 : cache size      : 64 KB : This is one hella slow cpu
[01:25] <dm> ANYONE familiar with banshee
[01:25] <mordof> Shaba1: no by remotely i mean by not loging in to a local user
[01:25] <dm> ?
[01:25] <mordof> Shaba1: i'm still not sure where you're going with all this..
[01:25] <ctkroeke1> dm: isn't it a music app
[01:25] <mordof> Shaba1: if you want help you're going to have to tell us the problem
[01:25] <dm> ctkroekel yes
[01:25] <Shaba1> local user
[01:25] <Shaba1> No
[01:25] <malakhi> dm, a bit, yes. And the version in the repos is the current stable version.
[01:25] <malakhi> at least in edgy
[01:26] <lullabud> DarkMageZ:  anything running off a livecd is going to be slow, especially with 32mb of ram.  windows wouldn't function that way.
[01:26] <ctkroeke1> dm: stain' the obvious
[01:26] <Shaba1> They login to the workgroup that is part of the domain
[01:26] <Zeman> someone can tell me if there is a packet for ubuntu of a software similar Macromedia Flash?
[01:26] <dm> malakhi  0.11.1, but the one im trying to install is 9.11.1
[01:26] <Dreamglider> what is the linux network tool that was used to hack in to the machines mainframe in the Matrix ?
[01:26] <ubd> ntop error: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1621
[01:26] <lullabud> Dreamglider:  nmap
[01:26] <ctkroeke1> dm: use google http://banshee-project.org/Distributions/Ubuntu
[01:26] <dm> malakhi if im not mistaken thats a total of 9+ releases after the repo
[01:26] <Dreamglider> lullabud, is it any good for hacking ?
[01:26] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah... so you're saying you don't know how to make ubuntu login with those users?
[01:27] <malakhi> dm, there is no 9.11.1. 0.11.1 was released on 23 October, 2006
[01:27] <lullabud> Dreamglider:  it's a useful tool, if that's what you mean.
[01:27] <Shaba1> Win 98 users cannot be a part of the AD domain but you can connect the computers to a workgoup and use a win2k/NT domain server as a authentication machine
[01:27] <abo> does ubuntu (edgy) manages well 2cpu systems?
[01:27] <Dreamglider> lullabud,  ok thanks
[01:27] <DarkMageZ> lullabud, true. i guess i'll grab one of the spare hd's for an install then. but which distro would perform well on those low end specs?
[01:27] <Zeman> someone can tell me if there is a packet for ubuntu of a software similar to Macromedia Flash?
[01:27] <dooglus> which has the better support in ubuntu, nVidia or ATI, or isn't there much of a difference?
[01:27] <malakhi> dm, well, 0.11.2 was, but the differences are negligible.
[01:27] <Dreamglider> not that i know much hacking just courious
[01:27] <dm> malakhi im confused then
[01:27] <poolkey172> nmap is just a port scanner nothing else : If you want to do some serious stuff download the backtrack livecd
[01:27] <ctkroeke1> http://banshee-project.org/Distributions/Ubuntu give you the repository you need to do a apt-get install
[01:27] <lullabud> Shaba1:  this is the ubuntu room, and ubuntu is the topic, not windows networks.
[01:28] <mordof> lullabud: i think what he's getting at is that he wants his ubuntu machines to use a login that is on the win2k server machine.. and it loads their profiles over the network
[01:28] <Shaba1> I do not know if it is even possible mordof
[01:28] <malakhi> dm, where did you get the tarball from? it may just be a messed up file name.
[01:28] <dm> malakhi banshee is buggy, it wont use my plugins corretly, wiki wont work, and the album art downloader wont work
[01:28] <Shaba1> EXACTLY
[01:28] <dm> malakhi the banshee project site
[01:28] <i7ch> hi. i installed, then uninstalled opera. now various applications (xchat, wengo) launch URLs in w3m, rather than in firefox. how do i restore firefox to be the global default browser? firefox is already set up as default according to its own config, and under system -> preferences -> preferred applications.
[01:28] <Shaba1> Otherwise I just better open up the network to anyone
[01:28] <malakhi> dm, you mean the version from the repos is buggy?
[01:28] <ctkroeke1> dm:  http://banshee-project.org/Distributions/Ubuntu give you the repository you need to do a apt-get install
[01:28] <reiki> abo
[01:28] <Surghi> hi
[01:28] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah... lol.. you were being VERY vague.. and it was very hard to figure that out from what you were saying, lol
[01:28] <reiki> abobader?
[01:28] <Shaba1> plug the damn machines in and any tom,dick and harry can walk in and use them
[01:28] <abo> reiki, ??
[01:29] <Shaba1> I have no way of tracking who was on a machine.
[01:29] <damien_> dooglus: Having used both in the past, I'd say nvidia has better drivers in general, but neither ATI or nvidia have open source drivers.
[01:29] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah.. i see what you're getting at.. hold on
[01:29] <Surghi> please tell me an easy way to make a webradio.... I would like to stream some MP3's for 2 friends of mine.   I have a 2 mbit line
[01:29] <mordof> Shaba1: i know it's possible
[01:29] <dm> malakhi i guess.,. i am getting errors with the wiki plugin, and nothing seems to work properly, except playing music and reading my ipod
[01:29] <mordof> Shaba1: at least i think it is, lol
[01:29] <Shaba1> When they logs on. If they are authorized to be hear
[01:29] <reiki> abo sorry.... thought you might be someone I haven't seen in a long time from Kuwait
[01:29] <Shaba1> here.
[01:29] <DarkMageZ> i7ch, there's a tool available in universe called galternatives. install it and change the entre of x-www-browser back to firefox
[01:29] <dooglus> damien_: thanks
[01:29] <abo> reiki, I'm not... ;-)
[01:30] <dm> malahki heres an example "An exeption was thrown by the type of Initializer Gecko.WebControl.
[01:30] <Shaba1> they could just walk in the lab turn on the machine and do what the heck they want.
[01:30] <phillipc> what is the .at domain name for? hard to google for this information
[01:30] <haxality> hey, I have a question about pentium processors
[01:30] <reiki> abo heheh ok... sorry. :)
[01:30] <Shaba1> See what I eman
[01:30] <haxality> I have a generic pentium M in my laptop
[01:30] <Shaba1> mean
[01:30] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah.. i'm looking into it give me a minute
[01:30] <haxality> would this count as a pentium 3, a pentium3m, or a pentium4m?
[01:30] <Shaba1> Ok mordof
[01:30] <haxality> (trying to install apt-build)
[01:30] <avista> i need to remove clvm
[01:30] <tjs> whats the package for mod_alias on dapper? I cant find it anywhere, even packages.ubuntu.com
[01:30] <graft> .at is austria
[01:30] <avista> but sudo apt-get remove clvm fails
[01:31] <malakhi> dm, looks like an error in the plugin code. Is the plugin from the Banshee site? or from the default repo install?
[01:31] <i7ch> DarkMageZ, great tip! it worked! there was an old reference to opera, which i guess was defaulting to w3m. thanks!
[01:31] <reiki> I'm wondering... since I always boot to Edgy anyways.... if I shouldn't just bite the bullet, wipe my Dapper installation in sda1 and install Edgy there instead. I have this THING about wanting it on the faster of my 2 hard drives
[01:31] <Shaba1> Right now the users cannot get to the win98 desktop unless they provide a username and password. That combination is verified on the server. I user Active Directory users and computers to set up account. I have groups that can do certain things and get a certain desktop and others that cannot
[01:31] <tjs> reiki: what kind of response are you looking for?
[01:31] <Shaba1> See what I mean
[01:32] <avista> can anyone help me?
[01:32] <i7ch> reiki, why not? edgy is pretty stable for a desktop OS
[01:32] <reiki> tjs: basically if it's worth the trouble I guess :)
[01:32] <Shaba1> Like kids cannot get to the control panel. So they cannot change the wall paper
[01:32] <tjs> thats really your call
[01:32] <tjs> ;)
[01:32] <i7ch> avista, what is it saying when it fails?
[01:32] <dm> malakhi from the banshee site
[01:32] <XiXaQ> What is the name of that tiny email-checker-application? A little icon that you can click and run applications, etc?
[01:32] <Shaba1> I can track how long they use the internet.
[01:32] <peanutb> i7ch, if you want it to crash half the time
[01:32] <reiki> i7ch, Edgy has been flawless for me here... even with Beryl and everything
[01:32] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah i know exactly what you mean, i'm looking for the config area to make ubuntu respond to something like that
[01:32] <dm> malahki and the repo didnt give me all the plugins,
[01:32] <reiki> although I have Beryl turned off most of the time
[01:32] <Shaba1> I can restrict if they can use the computers during certain times
[01:32] <ctkroeke1> reiki: use some mirroring app i.e. "dd"

[01:33] <mordof> Shaba1: yeah but ubuntu would need to be configured to use a user that isn't on the local machine.. i'm looking for that
[01:33] <malakhi> dm, the ubuntu package for the banshee plugins includes all the official plugins, but none of the contrib ones, becuase they're not necessarily stable. Give me a sec while I look at the contribs to see what I can figure out.
[01:33] <Shaba1> But now with these new ubuntu machines that were are getting "donated" the 2k server will be blind.

[01:35] <Shaba1> Ok I was just explaining
[01:35] <Shaba1> Can linux be set up to verify using ldap
[01:36] <mordof> Shaba1: i'll check it out
[01:36] <graft> Shaba1: you mean logins? ought to be able to...
[01:36] <Shaba1> Because basically AD is a microsofts version of and LDAP server
[01:36] <Shaba1> brb folk
[01:36] <avista> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34664/
[01:36] <avista> can some one please help w/ that
[01:36] <ctkroeke1> reiki: like I said, mirror your current install to the other drive and do what you want with the other one
[01:36] <Rob-West> i cant empty my tash bin
[01:37] <reiki> ctkroeke1, ok
[01:37] <Shaba1> I have the ubuto and wine manuals printing out downstairs and need to get the hard copies
[01:37] <mordof> graft: yeah.. i know it should be able to, he knows nothig about ubuntu, he got a bunch donated to his network and he has to figure out how to integrate them
[01:37] <reiki> ooops
[01:37] <reiki> ctkroeke1, ok I guess I should read up on dd and see if I can do this
[01:37] <mordof> Shaba1: you shouldn't need wine for this
[01:37] <ctkroeke1> reiki: haven't tried it myself couse I haven't needed too, yep "man dd"
[01:38] <graft> Shaba1: try this http://mcwhirter.com.au/node/25
[01:38] <reiki> hehehe.... ok I know about man pages... THAT I can do :)
[01:38] <porkpie> hi guy's for some starnge reason when I do an up arrow I get garbage instead of the last command ?
[01:38] <Shaba1> Well I will need it to run the windows applications that some of the people that come in here use.
[01:38] <malakhi> dm, when you built the plugin, did you have an errors when you ran autogen.sh?
[01:38] <dm> malahki im trying some of the plugins
[01:38] <dm> malakhi yep
[01:39] <mordof> Shaba1: like? most windows apps have ubuntu alternatives
[01:39] <reiki> or..... I could try and convince the wife that I need another SATA drive :)
[01:39] <malakhi> dm, what were they?
[01:39] <hastesaver> porkpie, are you working over ssh or something? Is it your own computer that's physically the one you're working on?
[01:39] <mordof> Shaba1: most often wine won't run windows apps 100%, and it's a better idea to look for the actual alternative that will run right
[01:39] <graft> Shaba1: what app is it?
[01:39] <Rob-West> i cant empty my tash bin
[01:39] <avista> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34664/
[01:40] <avista> please advise
[01:40] <palomer> <:o
[01:40] <porkpie> come on guy's why can't I use the up arrow to use the last comand ???
[01:40] <mordof> porkpie: hm?
[01:41] <mordof> porkpie: in bash?
[01:41] <Shaba1> back
[01:41] <porkpie> mordof:yeah
[01:41] <mordof> Shaba1: what windows apps do you want to run?
[01:41] <mordof> porkpie: hrmm.. odd, no idea sorry
[01:41] <Shaba1> MS OFFICE
[01:41] <porkpie> mordof:all I get is garbage
[01:41] <mordof> Shaba1: you can use OpenOffice instead
[01:42] <porkpie> mordof:what is the command called ?
[01:42] <mordof> porkpie: for what?
[01:42] <Shaba1> mordof I would have to retrain/teach everyone that comes in here in a new office suite
[01:42] <graft> porkpie: um, do you have command history enabled?
[01:42] <ugarit> I got an fsck error on my swap partition, how do I fix that?
[01:42] <Shaba1> I am trying to make LESS work for myself not MORE Work
[01:42] <mordof> Shaba1: it's quite similar to it, and i can pretty much gaurentee 100% that MS Office WILL NOT work in Wine
[01:42] <dm> malahki i got the plugins working, the deb was the key, but now i need to solve this gecko problem
[01:42] <porkpie> graft:how do I check
[01:43] <tonyyarusso> Shaba1: Abiword is nearly identical in layout to MS Word
[01:43] <Shaba1> damn
[01:43] <dm> malahki Gecko is the mozilla linker so to speak,  allows the prog to access the internet through firefox correct?
[01:43] <phoenix_> hey is there anyway i can install amarok in ubuntu
[01:43] <strabes> Shaba1: it's not that much different unless you are trying to do very advanced tasks. Abiword is more similar to MS word but it doesn't have very many features
[01:43] <Shaba1> You guys are assuming that I am working with pople in here that have a facility with computers that you all do.
[01:43] <Shaba1> That is not the case
[01:43] <porkpie> graft:or how do I enable it
[01:43] <malakhi> dm, yes. I just built the plugin here too, and I'm getting the same error.
[01:43] <strabes> phoenix_: sudo apt-get install amarok
[01:44] <Shaba1> I mean we are talking about people that I have to say three times to click the right mouse
[01:44] <strabes> phoenix_: it should download all the required kde libs
[01:44] <stefg> yup, Phoenix, sudo apt-get install amarok
[01:44] <phoenix_> will there be any problem
[01:44] <mordof> Shaba1: we are only going by what you are telling us.. we are trying to help you out. We can't give you many alternatives
[01:44] <graft> porkpie: type set -o, see what it says for 'history'
[01:44] <mordof> Shaba1: if that's the case, maybe it would be easier to wipe ubuntu out and put windows on them?
[01:44] <Shaba1> and then when they go home and try something if what they see on their screen is different from what they saw here they will be lost.
[01:44] <strabes> Shaba1: then go with abiword. Your users obviously aren't very advanced users, and abiword is the closest in layout to MS word
[01:44] <thepancakeman> Hi, where is the extremely remedial ubuntu channel?
[01:45] <dm> malakhi ill try and find what i cant with google,
[01:45] <strabes> !ask > thepancakeman
[01:45] <mordof> thepancakeman: lol, what do you mena
[01:45] <dm> malakhi i wish i could just use itunes in linux jesus this would be so simple....
[01:45] <graft> frankly i think he'd be best off wiping and going with windows
[01:45] <robert__> is there a command to cear the trashbin
[01:45] <mordof> graft: yeah no kidding
[01:45] <graft> if he can afford the licenses
[01:45] <malakhi> dm, you can, but it's an even meaner hack
[01:45] <strabes> dm: no you don't; itunes is pretty nazi. there are plenty of alternatives. Rhythmbox and amarok are the best in my opinion
[01:45] <__mikem> mmm pancakes
[01:45] <porkpie> graft:what am I looking for
[01:45] <kalemika> Does anyone here know a lot about wireless networking in ubuntu?
[01:46] <Dheeraj_k> is there any plugin or program available to make pdf document direct browser web browser of particular web page
[01:46] <kalemika> I have a really quick newbie question.
[01:46] <mordof> Shaba1: if you have the licenses for it / can afford it easily.. it'd be better to just put windows on the machines if your users won't be able to learn a new interface
[01:46] <graft> porkpie: a line that says 'history    on' or 'history   off'
[01:46] <strabes> !ask > kalemika
[01:46] <Dheeraj_k> is there any plugin or program available to make pdf document direct browser web browser of particular web page?
[01:46] <porkpie> graft:no history in the list
[01:46] <graft> porkpie: um, type set -o history, then
[01:46] <dm> strabes, i am not an apple fan, but itunes was a friendly program
[01:46] <Shaba1> I do not mean to be negative guys
[01:46] <Dheeraj_k> hmm?
[01:46] <mordof> kalemika: i know about wireless networking.. you turn it on and it works ^-^ most of the time, hehe
[01:47] <kalemika> When I connect to a wireless network, it'll stay connected for about five minutes then lose connection and not be able to reconnect until I reboot.
[01:47] <ugarit> I got an fsck error on my swap partition, how do I fix that?
[01:47] <porkpie> graft:I also cannot backspace either ???
[01:47] <strabes> dm: not in windows it's not. It has an exe that runs when you start up your computer, etc.
[01:47] <Shaba1> but we people that work with these machines all the time sometimes forget how unknowledgeble that average every day user is.
[01:47] <strabes> dm: it's really bloated and slow
[01:47] <graft> porkpie: um, what'd you do to your bash environment? is it just this shell, or all shells?
[01:47] <strabes> Shaba1: just use abiword.
[01:47] <Shaba1> Trust me I got rudely awaken 4 years ago when I started working here.
[01:47] <Dheeraj_k> is there any  program available to make pdf document direct browser web browser of particular web page
[01:47] <mordof> Shaba1: which is why it might be easier to just put windows on them
[01:48] <Shaba1> I am thinking of that
[01:48] <kalemika> Does anyone have any ideas? It's really annoying as my primary method of internet access is wireless.
[01:48] <ski-worklap> hmm
[01:48] <Shaba1> I have all the original windows install cd's
[01:48] <mordof> Shaba1: not only are the programs different.. but even to open the programs things are different
[01:48] <ski-worklap> is there a way to access the fancypants networking tool that's prominent oin the install cd once the os has been installed to disk?
[01:48] <strabes> Shaba1: put windows on there if you have the money, and if they're not going to be doing things like checking email, etc. inexperienced people have a habit of opening up every email they get no matter who its from
[01:48] <graft> Dheeraj_k: your question isn't quite comprehensible - are you trying to find a within-browser PDF plugin?
[01:48] <Shaba1> yeah
[01:49] <porkpie> graft:'# set -o history
[01:49] <porkpie> set: 96: Illegal option -o history
[01:49] <Shaba1> Well I have a automatic spyware program for that graft
[01:49] <Dheeraj_k> graft: with acrobat in windows I was able to make pdf document directly from i.e browser
[01:49] <graft> porkpie: you're doing this as root? on ubuntu? running bash?
[01:49] <Dheeraj_k> of web page
[01:49] <porkpie> graft:yep
[01:49] <Shaba1> it runs in teh background and block any attachments that are not jpg,wav,mp3.bmp,gif or mpg
[01:49] <dm> strabes i dont have a problem with itunes, my computer ran it smooth, (dual core, 667 FSB)
[01:49] <graft> Dheeraj_k: yeah, you can get an acrobat-for-firefox-etc. plugin for linux...
[01:49] <worldjam> is there a way to open fpm (frugalware) files in ubuntu?
[01:50] <kalemika> Can someone please help me?
[01:50] <graft> Dheeraj_k: check out mozilla-acroread
[01:50] <strabes> dm: doesn't mean it's not bloated. It is a very useful program I agree. It was just too feature rich for me.
[01:50] <strabes> Dheeraj_k: i know ooffice can export directly to pdf
[01:50] <Dheeraj_k> thanks let me try :)
[01:50] <graft> porkpie: um, how did you start this root shell?
[01:50] <kalemika> This is really frustrating, I'm just looking for a way to get the wireless connection to reconnect when it drops or at least allow me to manually do so.
[01:50] <strabes> graft: type su in terminal
[01:50] <porkpie> graft:sudo -s
[01:50] <mordof> Shaba1: that works.. yeah. you'd have more fun putting windows on, lol.. prevent headaches and do that
[01:50] <CharlieSu> anyone using Ubuntu for a home gateway/router?
[01:51] <graft> porkpie: try sudo -i, see if that works any better
[01:51] <Dheeraj_k> strabes: it could be pain to make pdf of web page by using openoffice (copy and paste)
[01:51] <strabes> kalemika: sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager
[01:51] <strabes> kalemika: sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome
[01:51] <porkpie> OK
[01:51] <mordof> !ask > CharlieSu
[01:51] <strabes> Dheeraj_k: sorry then
[01:51] <mordof> lol, saw other people doin that and wanted to try it out ^-^
[01:51] <CharlieSu> mordof: that was my question!!
[01:51] <mordof> CharlieSu: oh, ok.. lol. sorry
[01:51] <kalemika> Thank you, strabes.
[01:51] <mordof> CharlieSu: no i'm not
[01:52] <worldjam> is there a way to open fpm (frugalware) files in ubuntu??
[01:52] <CharlieSu> mordof: cool..
[01:52] <graft> wait, Dheeraj_k - are you trying to CREATE a pdf? or view one?
[01:52] <Dheeraj_k> strabes:currently I am using the print method of konqueror browser
[01:52] <mordof> CharlieSu: the question just sounded like you were looking for someone that was running it so you could ask them a question
[01:52] <porkpie> graft:cool it's all there now  :)  thanks for your help
[01:52] <mordof> CharlieSu: i know some people do it though.. i used to have a friend that did it, heh
[01:52] <CharlieSu> mordof: no, i just wanted to know if many people were doing it
[01:53] <stormy|> I am having problems getting grub to work right...
[01:53] <Dheeraj_k> graft: pdf doc of web page
[01:53] <justMatt> Hey guys - I have just done an install of 6.10 - but Firefox seems to have ultra latency - is this normal?
[01:53] <mordof> CharlieSu: probably not a huge amoubt.. but some
[01:53] <CharlieSu> mordof: yeah..  i'm debating on using ubuntu or gentoo for my gateway/router  I got a cool routerboard http://routerboard.com/rb44.html
[01:53] <Jordan_U> kalemika: You will need to disable your wireless in System -> Administration -> Networking for your card to be recognised by network-manager, just FYI
[01:53] <stormy|> system says it casn't find the OS... probably because grub doesn't know what to look for

[01:54] <mordof> CharlieSu: nice!!
[01:54] <dm> strabes well im having a hell of a time getting any ipod friendly program running with an option for album art downloads.. Amarok wont sync the ipod, Gtkpod works good, but it doesnt play music and automatically get album art. Listen reads the ipod, but thats it
[01:55] <malakhi> dm, looks like you need to install mozilla cruft to get it to run.
[01:55] <dm> strabes and im realizeing banshee is teh suk
[01:55] <dm> malakhi in the repos ?
[01:55] <Dheeraj_k> is there any program available to combine 2-3 pdf doc together?
[01:55] <thepancakeman> OK, on the topis of iPods.  What is the EASIEST package that will allow you to manage two seperate ipods on one machine?
[01:55] <dm> malakhi nm i think i got it
[01:56] <strabes> thepancakeman: gtkpod probably
[01:56] <dm> thepancakeman gtkpod
[01:56] <malakhi> dm, ok.
[01:56] <strabes> dm: gtkpod is only for syncing ipod; i agree that banshee is pretty suck; i dont know why amarok isn't syncing your ipod; it should do it automatically. tried rhythmbox?
[01:56] <thepancakeman> THANKS!
[01:56] <malakhi> dm, this plugin is fairly hackish from the looks of it, so I wouldn't get too comfortable with it, regardless.
[01:56] <dm> strabes ryhtmbox has no option for album  art which is what i need
[01:56] <poolkey172> can sopmeone help me with kaffeine ?
[01:56] <dm> malakhi lol fun stuff... not
[01:57] <poolkey172> it keeps crashing with this error : Using host libthread_db library "/lib/tls/i686/cmov/libthread_db.so.1".
[01:57] <strabes> dm: go to edit, plugins. there is an art plugin there which you can enable to get it to fetch album art
[01:57] <strabes> dm: in rhythmbox
[01:57] <Pichu0102> Um, I need some help
[01:57] <Pichu0102> I have a broadcom wireless card
[01:58] <Dheeraj_k> everyBody:  is there any program available to combine 2-3 pdf doc together?  I have got 20 pdf doc and I want to combine it to make it 1
[01:58] <Pichu0102> And when people make calls, it cuts out
[01:58] <thepancakeman> could not find it with  apt-cache search gtkpod
[01:58] <poolkey172> !xine
[01:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xine - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:58] <Pichu0102> But I need to manually reconnect every time it cuts out with wifi radar
[01:58] <strabes> thepancakeman: i'm not sure what repo it's in, but did you do sudo apt-get update
[01:59] <dm> strabes ooo didnt notice that before, but can it sync the ipod?
[01:59] <strabes> dm: yes your ipod should show up inside rhythmbox
[01:59] <Dheeraj_k>  is there any program available to combine 2-3 pdf doc together?
[02:00] <strabes> dm: on the side pane. if you don't see the side pane hit ctrl+S
[02:00] <mcphail> Dheeraj_k: i think pdftk can do that
[02:00] <DigitalNinja> Is there a gnucash version 2 ubuntu package out there? I'm on Dapper
=== justMatt is now known as justMatt-away
[02:00] <thepancakeman> just did the update and searched again, no luck
[02:00] <foo> Hm, apt-file isn't on ubuntu, eh?
[02:00] <DigitalNinja> I tired to compile 2.0.2 from source but it isn't working
[02:00] <strabes> thepancakeman: make sure all the repos are enabled in /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:00] <dm> strabes i see it
[02:01] <malakhi> dm, strabes, rhythmbox is not able to sync ipods yet. Only play music shared on them.
[02:01] <thepancakeman> <-- remedial beginner, sorry, unsure
[02:01] <strabes> dm malakhi oops sorry lol
[02:01] <dm> malakhi ugh , yall are killing me..
[02:01] <Dheeraj_k> mcphail: thanks :)
[02:01] <dm> strabes lol
[02:01] <strabes> dm: amarok should sync your ipod.
[02:01] <malakhi> dm, banshee's ipod syncing works quite well (for me). and amarok works great
[02:01] <s0nix> anyone know the method to force nero to burn at 1x :S..... for my ubuntu cd
[02:01] <dm> strabes hmm , will it sync the album art ?
[02:02] <strabes> dm: dunno; i dont use it
[02:02] <strabes> dm: tried it?
[02:02] <dm> malakhi amarok seems kinda slow.
[02:02] <malakhi> dm, i'm not sure, but i think so. amarok is also much more stable than banshee, IMO
[02:02] <dm> malakhi i used ot use amarok all the time, but i never had an ipod
[02:02] <kudzubane> anyone here on an asus z71v?
[02:02] <dm> malakhi edia Device: iPod mounted at /media/ipod already locked! If you are sure that this is an error, then remove the file /media/ipod/iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesLock and try agai
[02:03] <DigitalNinja> Maybe I need to send an email to the list about gnucash 2.0.2
[02:03] <malakhi> dm, amarok is a little slow in gnome because it has to load up all the qt libraries.
[02:03] <mordof> how do i make apaches main dir when i type "localhost" point to /home/myuser/www???
[02:03] <mordof> i can't find it :S
[02:03] <graft> amarok supposedly has excellent ipod support
[02:03] <malakhi> dm, make sure all your programs that might be accessing the ipod are closed, then try again.
[02:03] <dm> malakhi course
[02:03] <malakhi> dm, if that doesn't work, just do what it says and delete the lock file.
[02:04] <strabes> dm: killall rhythmbox
[02:04] <strabes> yeah
[02:04] <dm> malakhi Amarok has been known to lock up my PC, if i get DCed ill brb
[02:04] <malakhi> dm, ok
[02:04] <dm> malahki the transfer button is greyed out
[02:04] <mcphail> mordof: you need to set the DocumentRoot
[02:05] <mordof> kk ty
[02:05] <thepancakeman> oh goodness.  I don't have the permissions to save it back.
[02:05] <dm> malahki taking a long time, keeps telling me building collection database
[02:05] <thepancakeman> actually I can't save it at all to that directory even with a different name
[02:06] <malakhi> dm, is there any indication of progress?
[02:07] <emmettshear> is there a simple way to set the capslock key as ctrl instead?
[02:08] <dm> malakhi nope, the progress bar went to 100% and dissappeared, like it was done, but the context and collection buttons are blank when i click them
[02:08] <dm> malahki is there anyway to repair the build , or w/e lol
[02:08] <malakhi> dm, hmm. i'm afraid have no idea there.
[02:09] <malakhi> dm, for amarok?
[02:09] <dm> malahki aye, looks like its corrupted
[02:09] <thepancakeman> Ahh, I figured out how to do it in the package manager and it changed it.
[02:09] <malakhi> dm, you could 'sudo aptitude remove --purge amarok'
[02:09] <malakhi> dm, then reinstall
[02:10] <synic> dm: do you use gnome or kde?
[02:10] <dm> synic gnome
[02:11] <dm> synic bad experiences with KDE

[02:11] <synic> dm: I don't know if you'd be interested, but I'll plug Exaile :)  http://www.exaile.org
[02:11] <dm> malakhi see, i did that and it comes up with my playlist again, and it keeps saying building collection database
[02:11] <malakhi> dm, hmm.
[02:11] <kalemika> I installed the network manager like you said but now I can't connect to wifi networks at all whatsoever
[02:11] <kalemika> Is there a wireless network manager I should be using or something?
[02:11] <malakhi> dm, i'm really not sure.
[02:12] <strabes> kalemika: network-manager-gnome
[02:12] <ski-worklap> wow, only a day dropped getting everything up and working with ubuntu. this is a vast improvement from the old days
[02:12] <kalemika> I installed that
[02:12] <strabes> kalemika: then run "nm-applet &"
[02:12] <ski-worklap> still a ways to go, but they are including firmware in whatever f's animal is
[02:12] <strabes> kalemika: it starts up with gnome
[02:12] <kalemika> Yeah.
[02:12] <kalemika> I see that up there.
[02:12] <dm> synic can it sync my ipod, and download album art automatically and then sync THAT to the ipod?
[02:13] <kalemika> The wireless one still doesn't do anything different though
[02:13] <kalemika> I still have to manually type a network name and stuff
[02:13] <bimberi> Freshwaterlarry: Each different connection will need to be set up as a different printer.
[02:13] <strabes> kalemika: wireless what?
[02:13] <kalemika> 802.11g
[02:13] <synic> dm: it doesn't sync.  You can, however, transfer songs to your ipod (album art included), or you can update all the songs on your ipod with just their album art.
[02:13] <blameless> anyone want to recommend a wireless mini pci card that will give me less headaches than a broadcom?
[02:13] <dm> synic well by sync i mean transfer :P
[02:13] <strabes> kalemika: is ssid broadcasting enabled on your router?
[02:13] <kalemika> blameless: I got my broadcom working really easy.
[02:14] <synic> dm: then yes, it can :)
[02:14] <kalemika> And strabes: yes
[02:14] <bimberi> ski-worklap: what were the difficulties?
[02:14] <bigfuzzyjesus> is anyone here familier with freeNAS
[02:14] <blameless> mine doesn't come until tomorrow but i gather i have to use ndiswrapper
[02:14] <ski-worklap> bimberi, obscure ethernet and wifi drivers
[02:14] <synic> blameless: intell 2200
[02:14] <kalemika> blameless: there's a thing you can get, it's twenty bucks but it'll configure it right away and you'll save yourself the hassle of having to get a whole new card.
[02:14] <synic> er.. intel
[02:14] <bimberi> blameless: Intel
[02:14] <ski-worklap> actually, the sound adjustment still doesn't work but i don't think i care about that
[02:14] <blameless> ok, i shall hunt for the intel cards.  thank you :)
[02:15] <strabes> kalemika: you should be able to just click on the nm-applet icon in the notification area and it should show you the SSIDs of available wifi networks
[02:15] <Freshwaterlarry> bimberi.  Have deleted printer, then tried to add anew.  but system does not see printer on cable, so I force it to the epson.  but not work
[02:15] <bimberi> ski-worklap: kk, well good on you for your persistence :)
[02:15] <strabes> kalemika: don't bother with system, preferences, networking
[02:15] <kalemika> Hmm, odd. Maybe it's not broadcasting strong enough?
[02:15] <thepancakeman> gtkpod - can I hook it up to my ipod with out danger of accidentally erasing stuff on the ipod automatically?
[02:15] <fishie> is anyone running democracy player .92 i compiled it from source, it loads but no videos will play
[02:15] <kalemika> Okay. I'm gonna move the computer and unplug the wired.
[02:15] <ski-worklap> bimberi, this is not persistence
[02:15] <kalemika> So brb.
[02:15] <strabes> kalemika: that could be the problem
[02:15] <bimberi> Freshwaterlarry: what type of connection?
[02:15] <synic> dm: you'll need to get the python-gpod package for ipod support.  It's in http://www.exaile.org/files
[02:15] <ReWT_AxS> anyone here use conky?
[02:15] <synic> thepancakeman: no.
[02:15] <bimberi> Freshwaterlarry: usb, parallel ...
[02:15] <Freshwaterlarry> direct cable to printer port
[02:15] <ski-worklap> getting java and all the necessary plugins, sound, decent graphics, etc. on freebsd 2.x, now THAT was persistence ;)
[02:16] <synic> thepancakeman: I know people who have had their ipod db corrupted by gtkpod... but I haven't had any trouble.
[02:16] <bimberi> ski-worklap: :)
[02:16] <synic> thepancakeman: it works just fine for me.
[02:16] <strabes> just use rockbox
[02:16] <stormy|> Question: I'm on LiveCD, how can I Reinstall grub on my linux partition (on the hard drive)?
[02:16] <dm> synic so far very cool, thank you for the suggestion
[02:16] <Freshwaterlarry> bimberi.  parallel cable
[02:16] <thepancakeman> heck, iTunes corrupts iPods as it is!
[02:16] <synic> dm: np.. be sure to post to the forum if you have any troubles.  Feedback is very welcome :)
[02:16] <strabes> thepancakeman: you can say that again
[02:17] <dm> synic will do , are you one of the programmers?
[02:17] <strabes> i'm on my 3rd ipod
[02:17] <synic> dm: i am
[02:17] <thepancakeman> I am hooking up my gf's ipod as a test.  She will kill me if the info disappears from her device.  Am I safe for the moment?
[02:17] <synic> thepancakeman: you're pretty safe unless something crashes while writing the database.
[02:18] <strabes> thepancakeman: you should probably turn off automatic syncing
[02:18] <thepancakeman> <--- is iPodless
[02:18] <dm> synic well lemme do a bit more testing, so far, and pardon my french, f-ing awesome, exactly what i was looking for
[02:18] <synic> dm: groovy :)
[02:18] <eilker> stormy|:Type "grub"
[02:18] <reiki> dm is french?
[02:18] <reiki> :)
[02:18] <rag> please a question about ubuntu in general
[02:18] <dm> synic well i just realized i have too much music
[02:18] <strabes> dm: what are you using?
[02:18] <dm> reiki some dirty language
[02:18] <dm> strabes Exaile.

[02:18] <strabes> dm: oh i actually tried that yesterday
[02:18] <dm> strabes ill get the link, one sec
[02:19] <reiki> dm: I was kidding... I'm 54 but not senile yet :)
[02:19] <eilker> stormy|:Type "root (hd0,6)", or whatever your harddisk + boot partition numbers are (my /boot is at /dev/sda7, which translates to hd0,6 for grub).
[02:19] <dm> strabes ah hehe
[02:19] <Draucon> not sure if its really ubuntu specific but i'm having trouble getting dialup working in ubuntu
[02:19] <dm> reiki im 21, and im REALLY senile...
[02:19] <stormy|> eilker:  in the terminal?
[02:19] <rag> how long time for a new software version entry on ubuntu repositories ?
[02:19] <reiki> heheh
[02:19] <rag> metatecque: how long time for a new software version entry on ubuntu repositories ?
[02:19] <Motto> does ubuntu have an irc client built into it?
[02:19] <synic> rag: 6 months from Edgy's release.
[02:19] <strabes> dm: it was the best music player i have ever used; there was one thing i didnt like about it though i forgot what it was though
[02:19] <synic> Motto: Gaim
[02:19] <dm> synic omg i love you..... will you have my babies
[02:19] <Motto> ahh thats what that is
[02:19] <eilker> stormy|: than Type "setup (hd0)
[02:19] <synic> dm: hehe :)
[02:19] <rag> synic: not for ubuntu versions, but a other software
[02:19] <Motto> ,,,new to linux/unix
[02:19] <synic> strabes: you should remember so I can fix it.
[02:20] <stormy|> let's go to a PM eilker
[02:20] <Draucon> is anyone on here using a serial modem for dialup?
[02:20] <eilker> stormy|: than quit grub and reboot
[02:20] <Berto2112> is anyone here good at deciphering the Xorg.0.log file?
[02:20] <rag> metatecque: synic: not for ubuntu versions, but a other software
[02:20] <eilker> stormy|: that is it
[02:20] <bimberi> Freshwaterlarry: ok, perhaps try other port types (LPT#1 in particular)
[02:20] <strabes> synic: i think it had something to do with fetching album art or something. it didn't want to work
[02:20] <metatecque> rag: what do you mean by "other" software?
[02:20] <synic> rag: no software is updated in the repos unless it's a security problem.
[02:20] <strabes> synic: i'm behind a pretty nazi proxy though
[02:20] <bimberi> Draucon: not now, but I have
[02:20] <Tixer> can someone tell me the terminal command to find the internal IP of a compy?
[02:20] <bimberi> Tixer: ifconfig
[02:21] <Tixer> ty
[02:21] <synic> strabes: ah, yeah, there's currently no proxy support.
[02:21] <Draucon> bimberi: i'm having a problem with connecting at the correct baud rate
[02:21] <thepancakeman> all I can find in preferences is delete confirmation, but nothing that allows me to turn auto-synch on or off.  little help?
[02:21] <Draucon> bimberi: it always seems to connect at half of what i give it
[02:21] <synic> strabes: er... wait, your proxy blocks amazon?
[02:21] <rag> synic: metatecque: then! how to apt get last versions for software?
[02:21] <strabes> synic: i dunno
=== zonum_ is now known as zonum
[02:21] <synic> rag: you could check backports for it
[02:22] <strabes> synic: i can go to amazon.com, but exaile isn't fetching the album art =\
[02:22] <eilker> stormy|: i cant send pm some registration problem
[02:22] <Draucon> bimberi: if i give it a baud rate of 56 it connects at 28.8 and if i specify a baud of 384 it connects at 19.2.. any ideas?
[02:22] <synic> strabes: hrmm, what does it say for the amazon locale in the advanced prefs?
[02:22] <synic> rag: http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
[02:22] <metatecque> rag: usually when you apt-get you will get the latest - but if you want newer than that you have to go upstream ... a.k.a. beta
[02:22] <dm> synic one question how do i make it so i can just add my song to the play list instead of haveing to scroll through the artisys.
[02:22] <stormy|> eilker: since i'm doing a dual boot of windows and ubuntu... what drive do I pick for the "root (hd0,6)" command
[02:22] <poolkey172> Hi anyone know how to reinstall xine ?
[02:23] <VigoFusion> Why do I have a Konsole and a Terrminal?
[02:23] <rag> metatecque: ok which link?
[02:23] <strabes> synic: us
[02:23] <synic> dm: what do you mean?
[02:23] <strabes> i'll try ca
[02:23] <bimberi> Draucon: sorry, apart from asking it to connect at 112, i don't know :|
[02:23] <Gevaudan82> odd question, but I figure it is worth a shot...Is there a way to map a samba network drive at work in Windows XP so that I can drag and drop files if the only ports I only have access to port SSH on port 22? i basically want VPN functionality without the VPN
[02:23] <rag> metatecque: how to beta repositories?
[02:23] <strabes> VigoFusion: those are 2 different terminal emulators
[02:23] <metatecque> rag: look at synic's link - one page up
[02:23] <Draucon> bimberi: thanks anyways:) maybe wvdial has a channel on here
[02:23] <dm> synic on the right, there are all the artists, but i just want a list of the songs
[02:23] <metatecque> rag: you have to compile beta yourself
[02:23] <thepancakeman> anone know how to ensure auto sync is OFF in gtkpod?
[02:24] <eilker> stormy|: u write in terninal
[02:24] <raplhu88> anybody know where does firestarter keep logs?
[02:24] <bimberi> Draucon: you could try pppconfig as an alternative dialer
[02:24] <synic> dm: oh.  There's currently no way if I understand you correctly.
[02:24] <Dheeraj_k> sudo dpkg -r xine-ui
[02:24] <Dheeraj_k> sudo apt-get install xine-ui
[02:24] <dm> synic aww, too bad : (
[02:24] <Draucon> bimberi: i've tried that and then pon and poff but still same problem
[02:24] <strabes> dm: you can go to playlists and then see the entire library playlist i guess
[02:25] <bimberi> Draucon: kk
[02:25] <thepancakeman> FREE BUNNIES!
[02:25] <synic> dm: not impossible to add.  What are you trying to do?
[02:25] <dm> synic what about moving album art to my ipod , does it do it automatically?
[02:25] <poolkey172> dheeraj_k what about --purge ?
[02:25] <dm> synic afk really quickk
[02:25] <stormy|> okay eilker, now which partition do I pick? the windows one or the linux one? (shouldn't the settings for the boot be saved in the same partition or something? I'm really new to this)
[02:25] <VigoFusion> strabes: So I can delete Konsole safley, looks like a KDE thingy.
[02:25] <synic> dm: yeah, as long as exaile has already found the album art, it'll be transferred with the tracks
[02:25] <strabes> VigoFusion: yeah
[02:25] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[02:25] <bimberi> whoa it's the dpkg expert :)
[02:25] <strabes> VigoFusion: as long as you have another terminal emulator installed like gnome-terminal
[02:25] <raplhu88> where can if find firestarter logs?
[02:25] <Berto2112> my nvidia driver apparently isn't detecting my monitor and it's falling back to 800x600.  any ideas?
[02:26] <synic> raplhu88: I'm going to guess that they might be in /var/log/syslog
[02:26] <strabes> yeah synic, it's not fetching =\
[02:26] <synic> strabes: weird.  You're using 0.2.6, right?
[02:26] <VigoFusion> strables: Yes I do, two terminals just didnt seem right
[02:26] <synic> strabes: what artist/album are you looking for?
[02:26] <eilker> !grub
[02:26] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto

[02:26] <ubotu> dpkg is the Debian package maintenance system, which together with apt forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit.
[02:26] <poolkey172> hey bimberi how r u ?
[02:26] <synic> strabes: does this find them?  http://binary.twi.gs/albums.php
[02:27] <rag> metatecque: then synaptic, aptitude, or other software managment systems not works on updates?
[02:27] <bimberi> poolkey172: quite well, and you?
[02:27] <poolkey172> bimberi ; yeh loving my sweet system
[02:27] <bimberi> cool
[02:27] <jhammel> has anyone else had trouble getting firefox 2.0 working with ubuntu 6.10?
[02:27] <strabes> synic: nothing obscure; yes that url finds them
[02:27] <poolkey172> bimberi ; pity it wasnt a fresh install but we cant have everything
[02:28] <mordof> can anyone list a few good games to look for in dapper?
[02:28] <synic> strabes: hrmm, it definitely is your proxy then.
[02:28] <mordof> ones in the repos
[02:28] <strabes> synic: bummer
[02:28] <synic> strabes: that url uses the same code (basically) to find art
[02:28] <ArrenLex> jhammel: No. Are you trying to use the official FF or getting it from the ubuntu repositories?
[02:28] <eilker> stormy|: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[02:28] <strabes> synic: i think everything has to go through port 80 on my proxy
[02:28] <jhammel> ArrenLex: the one from ubuntu works..but its 64 bit so doesn't work w flash.  the official one doesn't work
[02:28] <ealvarado> Hi, need help with saslaught please
[02:29] <strabes> !ask > ealvarado
[02:29] <dm> synic if thats true, i will be really really happy
[02:29] <ArrenLex> jhammel: Is there any reason you need a 64-bit distro? Running them is a nightmare.
[02:29] <eilker> stormy|: you gonna write find /boot/grub/stage1 to see which partition
[02:29] <blameless> jhammel: you have to do some things to get the 32-bit flash to run on 64-bits.  i run it without issue
[02:29] <metatecque> rag: you will need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the approiate "backports" repositories
[02:29] <blameless> jhammel: ert, 32-bit firefox that is
[02:29] <kalemika> Okay I keep having problems. Now my system won't boot past "checking filesystems"
[02:30] <synic> dm: hehe, that part, at least, HAS to work.  I have a 5g ipod, and I love my album art.
[02:30] <ealvarado> strabes look when try to login with smtp get 535 5.7.0 Error: authentication failed: generic failure
[02:30] <kalemika> I have to go into recovery mode, otherwise it hangs for a while then just dumps me to that console screen.
[02:30] <jhammel> blameless, ArrenLex: my previous 64bit systems (slamd64, gentoo) both work with firefox 2. ootb
[02:30] <eilker> stormy|: "find /boot/grub/stage1"
[02:30] <stormy|> eilker: okay so... I think what i want to do is have windows do a chain load or whatever... right?, but I can set that up safely after getting grub to boot linux up? (I'm concerned with it messing up the boot system for windows)
[02:30] <ArrenLex> jhammel: you can use nspluginwrapper to run 32-bit plugins on 64-bit browsers
[02:30] <rag> metatecque: ok i say you my backports
[02:31] <strabes> ealvarado: i dont know the answer to your question; i was just telling you to ask the question, not to ask to ask a question
[02:31] <jhammel> ArrenLex: thanks.
[02:31] <rag> metatecque: i have only this deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse
[02:31] <thepancakeman> OK, how do I mount the iPod after plugging it into the USB port on the computer?  SHould it detect it automagically?
[02:31] <Dheeraj_k> pdftk is cui or gui based application?
[02:31] <ealvarado> ok sorry
[02:31] <metatecque> !backports > rag
[02:31] <eilker> stormy|: you will have both win and ubuntu, no problem
[02:31] <ArrenLex> jhammel: I know for a fact gentoo goes through several hoops to make sure you have 32-bit libraries installed so you can run 32-bit apps. This means that you're using more disc space, the startup time for those applications is longer than usual, and you get no benefits.
[02:31] <mcphail> thepancakeman: it will probably mount at /media/ipod

[02:33] <thepancakeman> nothing on my desktop
[02:33] <synic> blameless: what's biarch?
[02:33] <stormy|> so eilker, what we're doing is just reinstalling grub because aparently it doesn't detect windows or linux? I'll do the thing on the webpage you gave me, right? (sorry, i'm like really new to this)

[02:35] <ski-worklap> does ubuntu have a bittorrent gui client built in?
[02:35] <stormy|> Okay eilker, I tried doing the "find..." command in the terminal, it didn't find a folder, so how do I know where my root install is? I installed it to /dev/std3 i believe
[02:35] <synic> dm: itunes 7 fscks your ipod something fierce.  I had to trick it to make it work with linux tools (gtkpod, exaile, libgpod based software)
[02:36] <dm> synic how do i make this work then ?
[02:36] <synic> dm: and even if you get album art to work with any of those apps, plugging it in to iTunes 7 will erase all the art.

[02:38] <Gevaudan82> Can anyone provide the basic syntax to creating packages from source code using dpkg? For a simple example, assume the source code packages are compiled and installed in /usr/local/myprogram

[02:40] <synic> dm: just be sure to right click and eject on your desktop.
[02:40] <rag> metatecque: just apt-get update :), is necessary reboot?
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> Gevaudan82: I already did, hence the "^^^^^" but I will copy it, and paste it in.
[02:40] <green_earz> ski-worklap: if you want to go big time have look at setting up a torrentflux machine > http://www.torrentflux.com/   you shoulb able to find the package with sudo aptitude show torrentflux
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> " how do I "cd" to a smb share?"
[02:40] <dm> synic thats a bad link
[02:40] <metatecque> rag: that will work - sorry - I have been up for over 24 hours
[02:40] <thepancakeman> what am I looking for in the dmesg?
[02:41] <synic> dm: er, try it again.  I had a bad .htaccess file in there.
[02:41] <eilker> stormy|: ok
[02:41] <synic> thepancakeman: pastebin the last 50 lines or so - http://rafb.net/paste
[02:41] <eilker> stormy|: grep groot  /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:41] <kalemika> Okay, I got my system to boot with a patch but now I still need help getting ubuntu to deal with my wireless properly. I have the gnome applet running but it only gives me the option of the wired network.
[02:41] <Gevaudan82> Megaqwerty: are you trying to access the samba share from windows or linxux? and if linux the command line or gui?
[02:41] <eilker> stormy|: just type it in terminal

[02:42] <rag> synic: metatecque: but not appear me last versions of software, why?
[02:42] <synic> dm: nah, that's not even my serial.  All libgpod cares about is the buildid
[02:42] <dm> synic should i save this as a txt file ?
[02:42] <rag> synic: do you know please?
[02:42] <synic> rag: because they aren't in backports either
[02:42] <synic> dm: yup
[02:42] <Gevaudan82> Megaqwerty: I think this will work...I don't remember the syntax off hand....smbclient //serverIP/sharename -U username
[02:42] <thepancakeman> synic, never done this before. I pasted it in there. now what?
[02:42] <stormy|> eilker: it doesn't say anything related to my hard drives...
[02:42] <grego22> some one can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:42] <rag> synic: then? how to install
[02:43] <synic> thepancakeman: give me the url that's in your address bar.

[02:43] <strabes> kalemika: what is your problem?
[02:43] <eilker> stormy|: dont u get that _?
[02:43] <netrix> i have a seagate tape drive that needs ide-scsi to work but ide-tape gets loaded by default when i boot.  how can i get ide-scsi to load instead?
[02:43] <Megaqwerty> Gevaudan82: okay, I don't know how this will really help. I'm going to give you the command I am trying to execute on this share...hold on...
[02:43] <synic> thepancakeman: it's not seeing your ipod at all... are you sure you're plugging it into a live port?
[02:43] <rag> synic: bye thx ,only say me
[02:44] <thepancakeman> kalemika, I believe someone was answeringyour previous question but you left before they hit enter.
[02:44] <ski-worklap> green_earz, thanks
[02:44] <dm> synic do a coulple syncs with gtkpod ?
[02:44] <synic> dm: yeah, load up gtkpod, hit read, then sync
[02:44] <thepancakeman> Yeah, my mouse works in it.  Funny, until recently, my mouse did not work in that port.
[02:44] <kalemika> thepancakeman: Sorry about that, I found a code patch that fixed that problem.
[02:44] <rag> metatecque: synic: then is there software not posibble update until ubuntu release other version 6 months each?
[02:44] <Megaqwerty> Gevaudan82: sudo tar -cvpjf <My Windows Share Here>/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/media /
[02:44] <thepancakeman> lemee switch the ports around
[02:44] <green_earz> np
[02:44] <dm> synic lets all cross our fingers
[02:44] <grego22> some one can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:44] <kalemika> strabes: I installed the manager applet, it's not detecting wireless networks, though. I can't figure out why.
[02:44] <synic> dm: I'm not exactly sure what combination of things I did got the album art working again after the dreaded itunes 7 borked it.
[02:45] <tannerld> ow
[02:45] <strabes> kalemika: sudo ifconfig eth1 up
[02:45] <stormy|> eilker:  i'll paste what i got somewhere
[02:45] <synic> rag: you can make your own package, or compile it from source (be careful on that last one)
[02:45] <rag> metatecque: synic: i have to time to sleep now, 3 am here :(
[02:45] <kalemika> strabes: okay, thanks
[02:45] <metatecque> thepancakeman: was your ipod loaded with a mac - if so you need to get HFSplus to read the drive
[02:45] <rag> synic: no problem i came from gentoo :)
[02:45] <Megaqwerty> Gevaudan82: does that help you with my issue at all?
[02:45] <strabes> kalemika: also make sure wireless is enabled in the applet
[02:45] <Hoodman> Anyone arround that can help a very new user install a graphics driver?
[02:45] <strabes> kalemika: right click on it
[02:45] <kalemika> strabes: okay
[02:45] <synic> rag: you'll need to install build-essential to get all of your compiler stuff
[02:45] <Gevaudan82> Megaqwerty: gimme a second...i'll msg you
[02:46] <strabes> Hoodman:  depends on whether you have ati or nvidia
[02:46] <kalemika> strabes: The only option I get when I right-click it is "enable networking."
[02:46] <rag> synic: iknow, i thinked than ubuntu and synaptic have a cool managmente system
[02:46] <thepancakeman> synic, I think that may have fixed THIS problem. thx
[02:46] <Hoodman> strabes Nvidia
[02:46] <strabes> kalemika: is your wireless card on?
[02:46] <Megaqwerty> Gevaudan82: k
[02:46] <kalemika> strabes: yes.
[02:46] <rag> sync, metatecque, bye friends, thx
[02:46] <synic> thepancakeman: wait, what?
[02:46] <kalemika> strabes: I can see the light on it and everything.
[02:46] <grego22> some one can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:46] <strabes> kalemika: was it on when you booted up your computer?
[02:46] <rag> sync, metatecque, time to halt! :)
[02:46] <kalemika> strabes: yes, it turns on during the boot process.
[02:47] <thepancakeman> meta, nope, XP MCE
[02:47] <kalemika> strabes: the switch is internal, I have a program which turns it on automatically.
[02:47] <kalemika> strabes: it's that DriverLoader one.
[02:47] <thepancakeman> I can see all the files on the ipod now, thanks
[02:47] <dm> synic now should i have to sync gtkpod all the time ?
[02:47] <thepancakeman> the port I was using must be flaky in linux.
[02:47] <synic> dm: no
[02:47] <metatecque> thepancakeman: just thought I'd throw that out there before you drove yourself nuts
[02:47] <thepancakeman> thank you meta
[02:47] <strabes> kalemika: do you know if ubuntu is seeing it though?
[02:48] <strabes> kalemika: what does sudo ifconfig eth1 say?
[02:48] <stormy|> eilker:  http://pastebin.ca/261256
[02:48] <dm> synic its not doing the album art , darn it
[02:48] <stormy|> eilker:  sorry for the delay, doing several things at once
[02:48] <kalemika> strabes: ubuntu sees it in the network configuration thing, and if I go to the wireless applet on the bar I can connect, but only once and once it drops I can not connect again until I reboot
[02:48] <green_earz> Hoodman:  to find out the name of the driver for the video card visit > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/   then run the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and go thought the config process for the xserver
[02:48] <synic> dm: if you run gtkpod from the cli, and you hit sync, does it say "Could not write ArtworkDB" on the console?
[02:48] <thepancakeman> now it tells me I need a decoder!
[02:49] <grego22> some one can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:49] <strabes> kalemika: that's wierd; do you have some sort of strange setting on your firewall on your router or something?

[02:49] <strabes> kalemika: ok that's good
[02:49] <synic> dm: wait, did you play the track in question so that exaile could find the art first before doing the album art update?
[02:49] <strabes> so it's seeing your card
[02:49] <kalemika> strabes: I can connect if I go through the other applet, it's just this particular applet does not work.
[02:50] <dm> synic it said something about itunes DB the first time, but 3rd and 4th time of mounnting it didnt say it
[02:50] <green_earz> Hoodman: have you got the new card installed  ?
[02:50] <ski-worklap> green_earz, mmm torrentflux looks pretty neato
[02:50] <kalemika> strabes: but I can only connect once. after that it's no good.
[02:50] <dm> synic aye all in my playlist
[02:50] <grego22> des someone can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:50] <strabes> kalemika: try installing wifi-radar
[02:50] <ski-worklap> i might have to take that fora  spin
[02:50] <synic> hrmm.
[02:50] <grego22> does someone can help me to compile my kernel ?
[02:50] <strabes> kalemika: that's a wierd problem; i've never heard of that before
[02:50] <Hoodman> green_earz its a new install of ubuntu, and i havent used linux before
[02:50] <green_earz> ski-worklap: its the topps
[02:50] <synic> grego22: first things first, why are you compiling your kernel?
[02:50] <ski-worklap> hmm
[02:50] <strabes> hoodman: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php?title=Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA
[02:50] <grego22> synic i want a pretty fast kernel
[02:50] <stormy|> eilker:  300GB, the partition is 75GB
[02:50] <synic> dm: I'm not sure.  I did have to fiddle it for a while before it started working after iTunes update it.
[02:51] <ski-worklap> anyone else have a problem with gaim where when you get a new message the window won't stop flashing?
[02:51] <grego22> synic without useless modules for me
[02:51] <synic> er.. updated it.
[02:51] <ski-worklap> err window monitor thing in the gnome panel, not the window itself
[02:51] <strabes> Hoodman: do you know what a repository is?
[02:51] <synic> grego22: have you compiled a kernel before?
[02:51] <dm> synic ok thanks bro ill play around with  it alittle before i bother ya again : P
[02:51] <thepancakeman> I can play the radio from the interface and it sounds ok, but I can't play the tunes on the ipod
[02:51] <grego22> synic like PCMCIA, BLUETOOTH, IRDA, Nvidia, 3dfx and others
[02:51] <kalemika> strabes: wifi-radar sees networks
[02:51] <kalemika> strabes: but I've never been able to connect through it.
[02:51] <qc_> This may be way offtopic - where can i download ddos tools(FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY) to test against my own network security
[02:51] <grego22> synic ive been reading about this
[02:51] <grego22> synic but its generating some errors here =/
[02:52] <synic> grego22: well, it's a good thing to learn, but really, recompiling your kernel won't help you much with speed.  And those useless models?  The kernel only loads the ones it needs.
[02:52] <synic> er.. useless modules.
[02:52] <Hoodman> Can someone explain to me what a repositor is, and how to choose one?
[02:52] <grego22> synic but the kernel its "fat"
[02:52] <green_earz> ski-worklap: i have it setup on a p3 450 with 250 ram and runs very well
[02:52] <grego22> synic do u agree?
[02:52] <kalemika> strabes: wifi radar won't let me connect
[02:52] <eilker> stormy|: did you do this  "Type "grub" which makes a GRUB prompt appear.", when you wrote "find /boot/grub/stage1" ??
[02:53] <metatecque> !repository > Hoodman
[02:53] <strabes> kalemika: i dunno sorry. post in the forums
[02:53] <kalemika> strabes: thanks anyway.
[02:53] <strabes> hoodman: do you know what the terminal is?
[02:53] <synic> grego22: nope.  Ubuntu uses a modular kernel where mostly everything is compiled as a module.  It only loads the ones it needs, leaving you with a pretty "thin" running kernel.
[02:53] <strabes> kalemika: np
[02:53] <stormy|> eilker:  Error 15: File not found
[02:54] <qc_> where can i DL ddos tools(for test purposes only) to test against my OWN network's security lol
[02:54] <synic> grego22: but I will agree, that learning to compile a kernel is kind of fun, so I'll help you :)
[02:54] <stormy|> eilker: it may be that it is running off of the liveCD...?
[02:54] <blameless> i really only compile a kernel so i can run my own patchsets
[02:54] <grego22> synic thanks dude
[02:54] <phoeni1> hi
[02:55] <phoeni1> how can i install amarok on ubuntu

[02:55] <strabes> hoodman: are you still there
[02:55] <grego22> phoeni1 sudo apt-get Install amarok
[02:55] <eilker> stormy|: ok
[02:55] <eilker> stormy|: lets starts again
[02:55] <VigoFusion> qc_: Those tools and many others can be found in the Synaptic Package Manager. Yet I think the iptables command serves the same purpose.
[02:56] <eilker> stormy|: 1/ in terminal write "su"
[02:56] <thepancakeman> m4a file type is the extension of the files on the ipod that I cannot play through the gtkpod software
[02:56] <synic> grego22: start off by installing build-essential
[02:56] <crimsun> thepancakeman: aac in an mpeg wrapper

[02:57] <stormy|> eilker: I dont' think it's setup, remember, i'm on LiveCD
[02:57] <thepancakeman> I need to get the gtkpod-aac package?
[02:57] <crimsun> thepancakeman: your m4a files need to be decphered, of course
[02:57] <crimsun> thepancakeman: yes.
[02:57] <kalemika> Can someone tell me how to set up the kernel to boot with out ACPI?
[02:57] <crimsun> kalemika: pass acpi=off on the kernel command line
[02:57] <strabes> m4a = nazi
[02:57] <synic> grego22: then install linux-source-2.6.17

[02:58] <stormy|> okay
[02:58] <crimsun> kalemika: sure, you need to append that to the #kopt line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:58] <thepancakeman> Synaptic does not see a package named gtkpod-aac
[02:58] <synic> grego22: oh, that works.  What part were you having trouble with, then?

[03:08] <Hoodman> strabes well, i found what a repository is

[03:09] <mooreand13213> can i install ubuntu on the same drive as windows without destroying my windows partition?
[03:09] <Hoodman> strabes and i downloaded and marked it for install

[03:09] <strabes> mooreand13213: same HDD, yes. same partition? no
[03:09] <Hoodman> strabes but thats it
[03:09] <strabes> Hoodman: ok to ADD repositories, you need to edit your sources.list. do that with:
[03:09] <mooreand13213> yeah, i knew it would have to be a different partition
[03:09] <strabes> Hoodman: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

[03:09] <thepancakeman> test
[03:09] <DevC> why wasn't GCC for c and c++ programming or ASM for assembly put into ubuntu by default?
[03:09] <Hoodman> strabes where do i type that?
[03:10] <jrib> linux_kid: why do that, when vlc is in the repositories?
[03:10] <strabes> Hoodman: in a terminal: go to applications, accessories, terminal
[03:10] <tonyyarusso> DevC: tbqh, I have no idea.
[03:10] <danl> hola
[03:10] <thepancakeman> I got the file saved /etc/apt/sources.list  but I cannot see the gtkpod-aac package
[03:10] <jrib> DevC: I'm not a dev, but most people that use ubuntu probably never need it
[03:10] <mcphail> DevC: because ubuntu is pitched towards general desktop users
[03:10] <tonyyarusso> DevC: We hope that normal users wouldn't need to compile anything, but it seems trivial to include it anyway
[03:10] <linux_kid> jrib, no, when i tried, vlc required its own reposotory
[03:10] <strabes> Hoodman: the terminal is used in linux a lot; make a shortcut to it on your panel or w/e
[03:10] <w3ccv> DevC, probably because of space
[03:10] <jrib> linux_kid: it's in ubuntu's universe repository

[03:11] <mooreand13213> how can i clone my windows partition onto my second drive in case i do mess up? a free solution would be nice
[03:11] <LjL> tonyyarusso: ... uh?
[03:11] <DevC> I doubt it was space....gcc package and asm are majorly small for command line programming
[03:11] <danl> is there any programs and or websites I can use to test which ports are not being blocked/filtered by my isp?
[03:11] <tonyyarusso> LjL: What'd I do now?
[03:11] <tonyyarusso> Other than getting a size on a metapackage - totally not valid
[03:12] <jrib> DevC: build-essential is on the cd, just not installed, so I agree with you that it probably is not a space issue

[03:13] <mcphail> DevC: it is very easy to install
[03:13] <LjL> tonyyarusso: well full installed size of a package is very hard to know in advance, since it depends on which packages you already have installed :P

[03:14] <tonyyarusso> LjL: Good point.  I seem to be getting a vague recollection of a conversation about trying to script that calculation, and it going over my head quickly.

[03:14] <mcphail> DevC: :)
[03:14] <Hoodman> strabes ive read all kind of documents, ive been trying to install a damn video driver for 4 hours
[03:14] <mooreand13213> partimage appears to be linux only, and it does not work with ntfs
[03:14] <metatecque> the pipe "|" only works in a term
[03:14] <mooreand13213> any other options?
[03:14] <strabes> Hoodman: just follow http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29
[03:14] <DevC> but I am happy that upgrading from 5.04 through to 6.10 went smooth today and I'm now uptodate with Ubuntu :)
[03:15] <varsendaggr> mooreand13213,  i did a ntfs   with partimage
[03:15] <metatecque> mooreand13213 you could buy norton ghost
[03:15] <strabes> Hoodman: i guarantee you it's easier than windows once you understand the basics of how linux works
[03:15] <thepancakeman> AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[03:15] <kudzubane> is $MANPATH used in ubuntu?  I don't see this env var in the environment
[03:15] <w3ccv> tonyyarusso, the compiler is small - 100k, but the headers take up abouit 200M, libraries ??
[03:15] <LjL> tonyyarusso: even if you did such a script, it would either 1) show the installed size with *all* the dependencies, which is totally useless since, for instance, it'll include libc6  or 2) use the standard set of packages that get installed in Ubuntu by default as a reference - which sounds better, but hard to implement, and then typing "apt-get install blah" is way easier ;)
[03:15] <mooreand13213> my como is windows only right now though, is there a program that will work in windoze?
[03:15] <metatecque> thepancakeman: BAD IPOD
[03:16] <linux_kid> Hoodman: have you tried vlc?
[03:16] <Hoodman> linux_kid what is vlc
[03:16] <Kud0s> Darn it ive deleted (a relativly uninportand) daemon script. is there any recycle bin in server edition?
[03:16] <varsendaggr> mooreand13213, there is a live Cd that has partimage on it that works well   let me find you a link
[03:16] <strabes> Hoodman: it's a video player
[03:16] <linux_kid> Hoodman: this really easy to install video and music player
[03:16] <bruenig> mooreand13213, you will have to do something like norton ghost because the way windows is setup won't allow you to copy some files while they are being used from what I have read
[03:17] <mooreand13213> aha
[03:17] <strabes> linux_kid: no he's trying to install a video card driver
[03:17] <jrib> Kud0s: you shouldn't see it unless you set it I believe
[03:17] <tonyyarusso> LjL: Nah, we were talking about making it fetch a list of already installed and comparing to that on the fly
[03:17] <kalemika> Hey, just a quick thanks to everyone who helped me. The reason I was having so much trouble was that my wireless card was named wlan0 instead of eth0
[03:17] <kalemika> So thank you!
[03:17] <strabes> Hoodman: forget what he said
[03:17] <jrib> kudzubane: you shouldn't see it unless you set it I believe
[03:17] <linux_kid> strabes: ok
[03:17] <LjL> tonyyarusso: but then what's the difference between that and apt-get install?
[03:17] <jrib> Kud0s: sorry, wrong name :)
[03:17] <linux_kid> strabes: what card?
[03:17] <Hoodman> i cant even intall something....i have what i need...i just cant install it
[03:17] <strabes> linux_kid: it's an nvidia. he is a totally new to linux
[03:18] <tonyyarusso> LjL: Fun with redundancy?  I don't know, it was -offtopic.
[03:18] <varsendaggr> mooreand13213, http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
[03:18] <jrib> Hoodman: what are you trying to install?
[03:18] <linux_kid> Hoodman: what letters appear after the last period (.) in the filename?
[03:18] <LjL> tonyyarusso: ah, that explains it :P
[03:18] <strabes> Hoodman: just go to the guide i pasted above, and then read the section on how to add extra repositories
[03:18] <Hoodman> i have the file on the desktop, i got from nvidia, i dont understand the instructiond
[03:18] <strabes> Hoodman: forget that stuff
[03:18] <strabes> Hoodman: actually nevermind that
[03:18] <strabes> Hoodman: is that a .deb file?
[03:19] <Jordan_U> Can I make an HFS+ partition in Ubuntu?
[03:19] <Kud0s> is there a recycle bin in server edition?
[03:19] <Hoodman> strabes its a .run
[03:19] <LjL> Kud0s: since there is no graphical interface, i guess not
[03:20] <strabes> Hoodman: forget it then
[03:20] <linux_kid> Hoodman: where did you download the driver from? and where are the instructions?
[03:20] <strabes> Hoodman: it's too complicated for you right now
[03:20] <linux_kid> Hoodman: forget what i said and listen to strabes... sorry
[03:20] <bruenig> Kud0s, I don't think so. All the trash does is mv files from one directory to another. So in order to do that, you would need to just use mv file /path/to/trash each time instead of rm, and then "empty" the directory by rm it occasionally.
[03:20] <jrib> Hoodman: use the driver from the repositories
[03:20] <strabes> linux_kid: haha
[03:20] <thepancakeman> OKOK, now I cannot play anything.
[03:20] <strabes> jrib: he's totally new to linux so i'm trying to explain it to him
[03:21] <Hoodman> ok, i can get to the repository, mark it for download, download it, and mark it for install
[03:21] <linux_kid> poor starbes is fighting off all these helpers
[03:21] <Hoodman> but the graphics are still choppy
[03:21] <ademan> how do all gnome applets have the same right click menu?
[03:21] <strabes> linux_kid: haha yeah
[03:21] <jrib> Hoodman: listen to strabes then :)
[03:22] <linux_kid> ademan: what do you mean?
[03:22] <strabes> Hoodman: no you have the terminology wrong. a REPOSITORY is where PACKAGES are located. you mark packages for download
[03:22] <fabiim> lol , maybe now someone can help me around with crontab!
[03:22] <phrizer> ademan, What do you mean?
[03:22] <fabiim> it's getting me crazy !
[03:22] <ademan> i mean when you right click on a gnome applet they all display the same popup menu, usually "remove this applet" along with preferences and a few others
[03:23] <Hoodman> strabes then where do they go?
[03:23] <ademan> and i was wondering how, it seems that every applet is in charge of making that menu itself though...
[03:23] <jrib> fabiim: don't edit /etc/crontab  use crontab -e
[03:23] <fabiim> jrib: do i need to restart the service after ?
[03:23] <Vorbote> ademan: that's something called "Human Interface Guidelines" of the GNOME project (nothing to do with Ubuntu really).
[03:24] <jrib> fabiim: but, that won't work if you are trying to start amarok since it won't know where to open the application, you need to set DISPLAY.  No you, shouldn't need to restart the service
[03:24] <strabes> Hoodman: where do what go?
[03:24] <strabes> Hoodman: in linux there's no .exe files
[03:24] <ademan> Vorbote: right, but i was wondering HOW that happened, i figured it was a function of the gnome panel (because they were all virtual identical) but it seems every applet is in charge of creating that itself
[03:24] <fabiim> how do i set DISPLAY ?  oh you remember  me lol =)
[03:24] <strabes> Hoodman: programs are installed with packages.
[03:24] <Hoodman> strabes ok, then i dont know what to do

[03:25] <john_> does anyone have a beryl burn plugin for edgy?
[03:25] <phrizer> ademan, Move, Remove and lock, are added by default. The programmer doesnt need to explicity create them.
[03:25] <Hoodman> strabes ive read 3 walk throughs
[03:25] <linux_kid> strabes: im a newbee but somehow i understand linux very well, want some help?
[03:25] <Hoodman> this is just to much
[03:25] <strabes> linux_kid: i know what i'm doing lol. do you mean help explain to him?
[03:25] <jrib> fabiim: nah, just did /lastlog fabiim.  DISPLAY=:0 amarok  should work.  You might need to do 'xhost +local:' as your user too
[03:25] <fabiim> well crontab talks about setting up the shell : bin/sh , that's the pointer to the bash shell right? the one we use in ubuntu
[03:26] <strabes> Hoodman: have you added any repositories yet?
[03:26] <linux_kid> strabes: ya ill translate
[03:26] <Vorbote> ademan: He! It depends on who you ask. Some will tell you that the people that made the first guidelines were macos people (true, some were the disigners of Mac OS 6 and 7), if you ask the LDE people they'll say the GNOME people were on heavy drugs :-)
[03:26] <ademan> phrizer: well, my applet doesn't have those

[03:30] <MikeyMike> i wonder why they didnt try to get the HD recovered by a center of some sort
[03:30] <Vorbote> ademan: and then GNOME is rather anaarchic, as a community. They put their act together very recently as compared to KDE, I do think Ubuntu is a reason behind that thrust. But that previous chaos can be seen in inconsistencies such as the one you observe about the applets.
[03:30] <phrizer> ademan, Um, really? In the panel applets i've created those 3 always get created by default.

[03:36] <Gevaudan82> wh00: click on the bottom right hand corner and change your session to Gnome and not Beryl
[03:36] <dabaR> wh00: tried failsafe gnome?
[03:36] <fabiim> jrib: DONE! it works , guess someone going to class tomorrow morning =)  thanks a lot ! =)
[03:36] <Flannel> wh00: You'll comment out your beryl startup script thing.  As in #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl, they'll know exactly how to do it

[03:38] <MikeyMike> fun fun fun
[03:38] <LadyNikon> lemme guess.. some retard came in with the router bug
[03:38] <linux_kid> LjL: what's up...?

[03:38] <strabes> dabaR: haha
[03:38] <LjL> !exploit | linux_kid
[03:38] <ubotu> linux_kid: There are people around who think it is funny to abuse a bug in certain routers by sending invalid DCC commands. When bitten by this bug ops in #ubuntu remove users so they are no longer targets. To fix it have a look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixDCCExploit
[03:38] <thepancakeman> HEH!!!
[03:39] <Jordan_U> LjL: You should give them more specific info like " update  your firmware " or "change ports" or something.
[03:39] <Flannel> Jordan_U: in the channel they get redirected to, the topic has all that info
[03:39] <LadyNikon> Jordan_U: it shouldnt be LjL job to give them a lesson on their bad routers ;)
[03:39] <eilker> stormy|: what happend ??
[03:39] <Crankymonky> Has anyone ever done any PSX emulation on linux?
[03:39] <Jordan_U> Flannel: Ahhh, didn't realize that :)
[03:40] <stormy|> eilker, I managed to get into windows via command line ;)
[03:41] <thepancakeman> Good night folks, thanks for all your patience
[03:41] <stormy|> grub works now, i just gotta get the method of picking the OS in the GUI working, which i think it's just a reference problem
[03:41] <DevC> LjL: why not just deactivate all DCC on your IRC? I make people either upload to a site or send me things in email I never accept DCC stuff (plus router is set to block them even if I accept them >:)
[03:41] <Flannel> DevC: it has nothing to do with the DCC itself, just that string of text.  But, this is offtopic.
[03:42] <stormy|> eilker: so i implemented the commands my friend gave me and logged into windows. I tried to use a variation of it for linux, but i have to load the kernel. will kernel /boot/vmlinux do it?
[03:42] <somian> Maybe it's a 10% FAQ or maybe a 90% FAQ, but: does Ubuntu have support for choosing a hard disk directory to be $HOME, or at least for saving user files / config
[03:43] <Flannel> somian: yeah.  All linux has that.  It depends simply on where you mount your home folder
[03:43] <somian> I mean the live CD, sorry
[03:43] <eilker> stormy|:           /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-23-386
[03:43] <DevC> Flannel: what are the other Ubuntu channels?
[03:44] <Flannel> DevC: well, for questions like that, theres #ubuntu-offtopic ;)
[03:44] <eilker> flannel: :))
[03:44] <eilker> flannel: useful answer , double sided:)
[03:44] <somian> I've got a 6.06 workstation cd I am running as a live system.
[03:44] <birdfish> How would I go about getting a personal script to run at boot time? (but only after the network interfaces have been brought up)
[03:44] <Flannel> DevC: theres a list on the wiki, or you can just ask chanserv (/msg chanserv list #ubuntu*)
[03:45] <strabes> birdfish: https://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
[03:45] <somian> birdfish: you could use the init.d / sysvinit methods

[03:48] <kishan> diocles: yes for firefox and also if we are watching some videos where are they temporary stored in ubuntu
[03:48] <somian> "temporary internet files" is probably most recognized as a Folder name in MS Windows; outside of Windows we speak of "browser cache".
[03:48] <stormy|> eilker, I'm on AMD64 though, will that change that command at all?
[03:48] <gerson> hello
[03:49] <eilker> stormy|:   i dont think so
[03:49] <diocles> kishan: Try in /tmp
[03:49] <matthew_w> Does anyone know how to get midi support, because I'm completely lost
[03:49] <jrib> kishan: ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache  but you usually don't want to try using that.  Maybe 'about:cache' is what you want (in your address bar)
[03:49] <stormy|> eilker, okay, also, do i need an initrd?

[03:50] <somian> I've got a 6.06 workstation cd I am running as a live system. Under these circumstances (I cannot perform a full system install on this box), does Ubuntu have support for choosing a hard disk directory to be $HOME, or at least for saving user files / config?

[03:50] <stormy|> eilker, yeah

[03:59] <diocles> gerson: Via a web server? Or via MSN/VoIP?
[04:00] <Slaj_R> ski-worklap: unless it's a different version
[04:00] <VigoFusion> I like Synaptic Package Manager, its GUI and rather easy to use and configure.
[04:01] <ski-worklap> Slaj_R, what version do you have?
[04:01] <ski-worklap> you probably want 9.x
[04:01] <Slaj_R> ski-worklap:  never mind.  I just installed exactly the package on the site you mentioned and still no flash.
[04:01] <nomasteryoda|w> synaptic is also a little lax in Kubuntu - it just removed a package "as i requested" eventhough it was breaking dependencies

[04:04] <levander> Why is using update-manager so much better than apt-get (or even aptitude) when doing a dist-upgrade?
[04:04] <LjL> levander: makes sure you have ubuntu-desktop installed and... well, perhaps something else :)
[04:04] <dabaR> levander: it is a tool made for the purpose of upgrading in Ubuntu, they intend to increase its checkas.
[04:05] <levander> dabaR: they don't have a command line interface to it?

[04:08] <downfallat111> is the upgrade to eft stable yet?
[04:08] <_kalm> hey can anyone help me with this? My internet connection keeps dropping me and the only way ill get it back up is by restart
[04:08] <dabaR> levander: supposedly it will check for changes done by things such as automatix, and so on.
[04:08] <_kalm> i use rt61 drivers with Ubuntu 6.10

[04:15] <iCod> disregard my comment, sorry

[04:19] <Pelo> typo,  I meant menu
[04:19] <zac2> ok
[04:19] <Pelo> what do you call dyslexia for typist ?
[04:19] <dabaR> Pelo: freaky fingahs
[04:20] <Pelo> :-)
[04:20] <dabaR> carpal tunnel
[04:20] <zac2> what operator for rm clears hdd space
[04:20] <iCod> Is there something like sudo apt-get install gnome?
[04:20] <dabaR> zac2: it is a delete files command.
[04:20] <dabaR> iCod: the package is ubuntu-desktop
[04:21] <Pelo> zac2,  rm is linux for  del
[04:21] <zac2> is it -a -s -d what?
[04:21] <Pelo> zac2,  http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[04:21] <bimberi> zac2: rm does free up space, no modifier needed
[04:21] <nomasteryoda|w> and it wipes
[04:21] <dabaR> zac2: it deletes a file, and thus clears hdd space
[04:21] <zac2> thamk you:)
[04:21] <cremis_> hello all
[04:21] <zac2> bye
[04:22] <cremis_> how do i know if my graphics card supports pixel chading
[04:22] <craigbass1976> Ok folks, I'm thinking of giving ubuntu another shot.  I like KDE.  Is kubuntu exactly the same, except with KDE?
[04:22] <Pelo> cremis_,   maker site maybe ?
[04:22] <raknam> how would i edit the grub command line before running the installer?
[04:22] <Pelo> craigbass1976,  pretty much
[04:22] <nomasteryoda|w> google?
[04:23] <dabaR> craigbass1976: that is a big difference...
[04:23] <dabaR> craigbass1976: the ubuntu distribution of software comes with common setups of the gnome, and the kde desktop environment. the back end they are ran on is the same.
[04:23] <levander> Mmmm, is this update-manager not going to give me the option to keep old configuration files?  Like when you dist-upgrade through apt-get, sometimes a configuration file has been changed in a package, and you are prompted if you want to keep the old one, or upgrade.  Is upgrade-manager going to "simplify" the process so much, I won't be given the option to keep my old configuration?
[04:23] <eilker> raknam: press "e"
[04:23] <Pelo> raknam,  no garranties but I don't think you can edit grub before installing it
[04:24] <bimberi> craigbass1976: it's the same infrastructure, but the interface is very different to Ubuntu's
[04:24] <josorio> hola  a todos!!
[04:24] <dm> anyone having problems with sound in edgy ?????
[04:24] <GenNMX> craigbass1976: Linux distros have always stressed flexibility. kubuntu is more like Windows, it includes a much prettier interface. I suggest you have a decent computer to run it.
[04:24] <levander> craigbass1976: all the non-UI applications - like servers - work the same in kubuntu
[04:24] <AnthonyG> Here is a paste of ModemData if anyone would like to assist, In short it is an Agere Systems 56K PCI SoftModem (V.92). http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34685/
[04:25] <tiptip> hmmm, my sound has disappeared :( anybody knows how to solve it ?
[04:25] <umista> ok when i try to install nvidia drivers for 6.06, i have to install a linux-image, is this right?
[04:25] <dabaR> tiptip: no sound or no sound icon?
[04:25] <stormy|> eilker: I got it running :)
[04:25] <tiptip> no sound
[04:25] <GenNMX> tiptip: Edgy or Dapper?
[04:25] <noclue> i need a pc to phone music programme for ubuntu any suggestions??
[04:25] <LjL> AnthonyG: hmm? if i'm not mistaken, it's the same one i've got. though no, i never got it to work (never tried very hard either)
[04:25] <tiptip> edgy
[04:26] <eilker> stormy|:  happy to hear it:)
[04:26] <stormy|> eilker:  I edited the shortcuts,.. they were pointing to the wrong partition :)... now how do I save what i rewrote?
[04:26] <GenNMX> tiptip: There are different versions of the kernel out there, you may have an older one.
[04:26] <chuckf> pc t phone music?
[04:26] <tiptip> i didnt something wrong and now there isnt sound (there was sound before)
[04:26] <AnthonyG> LjL: Oh,  Now I'm motivated XD
[04:26] <noclue> why do no companies support linux in their software???
[04:26] <[daemon] > Yo guys ad girls! Please take place in th  vote on irc-suse.org
[04:26] <eilker> stormy|: which shortcuts ?
[04:27] <levander> [daemon] : what daemon's doing, that's spam right?
[04:27] <LjL> !offtopic | [daemon] 
[04:27] <ubotu> [daemon] : #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[04:27] <tiptip> if i run the live cd there is sound , i just did something worng but i dont know what
[04:27] <aka_druid_> noclue: lots do
[04:27] <stormy|> eilker:  the ones that you pick with the arrow keys... where you pick your OS... i called it a shortcut b/c it's a "shortcut" of those commands
[04:27] <AnthonyG> noclue: Your username explains their knowledge of Linux :D
[04:27] <GenNMX> noclue: Because it costs a lot more money to train and hire people with Linux experience, when the vast majority that use Linux software are far more computer literate then the average IT guy.
[04:27] <somian> Most of the best software for Linux does not come from companies, noclue (altho companies may be behind it or support it)
[04:27] <NineTeen67Comet> Looking for a little advice .. I'm working on my father in law's box (Microtel Wal-Mart box that came with Lycoris 2 years ago for $299). It is an AMD Duron 1200, on board graphics and 256mb ram. I found a PCI (he doesn't have agp/pcie) FX5200. Would that help out with the glitchy video and lack luster DVD playback?
[04:27] <noclue> anthonyg you got it lol :P
[04:27] <eilker> stormy|: have a look here  /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:27] <dm> anyone having problems with sound in edgy ?????
[04:28] <craigbass1976> I just set a guy up with Fedora and KDE, but there are problems printing, so I've got the printer here and am going to try it with ubuntu.  He'll freak if there's one more new thing, so I think I better use kubuntu.  What would you all recommend for multitrack recording?  audacity, or is there another?
[04:28] <somian> AnthonyG: agreed (wrt the nick) ... it is like hanging a red flag saying "kick me" on it.
[04:28] <levander> dm, why not try being more specific with your question?
[04:28] <noclue> somian where do i look for it??
[04:28] <bimberi> AnthonyG (& LjL): doesn't look promising though Line 047 indicates that it (with PCI ID 11c1:048c) doesn't have Linux support :/
[04:28] <somian> Lycoris??
[04:28] <dm> levander i boot up and it doesnt transmit sound out of my laptop speakers, but rather, if i use the headphone jack, it works.
[04:29] <AnthonyG> Lol, My corny humor gets me comments but desperate need for help does not XD
[04:29] <noclue> anthonyg how d'you guess i am new at this??? lol
[04:29] <noclue> :D
[04:29] <somian> Par for the irc course, AnthonyG
[04:29] <AnthonyG> bimberi: Alot of modems don't.
[04:29] <deadlygorila> hello I need help
[04:29] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Just say you're a girl (Anthony is an androgonous name) and you'll get everyone in the channel wanting to help you.
[04:29] <stormy|> eilker:  how do I get there via terminal? ;) I want to get the hang of file navigation via terminal... it's like cd something right?
[04:30] <Dheeraj_k> can any body tell me the difference between multi programming and multi processing operating system? or any link other than wiki
[04:30] <craigbass1976> Is installed ubuntu any better for playing with a printer than running it off the cd?
[04:30] <levander> dm: and you've tried the speakers with the headphones completely unplugged - you know plugging the headphones in turns off the speakers?
[04:30] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: No , It's not
[04:30] <zac3> gnome
[04:30] <eilker> stormy|: nano  /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:30] <LjL> Dheeraj_k: as i told you - this kind of questions belongs to #ubuntu-offtopic
[04:30] <somian> GenNMX: so true
[04:30] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: I know a girl named Anthony. It's not an English name only.
[04:30] <eilker> stormy|: in terminal "nano  /boot/grub/menu.lst"
[04:30] <Dheeraj_k> LjL: I asked that question there
[04:30] <AnthonyG> I must say, nano rulez :D
[04:30] <zac3> what is javac
[04:30] <deadlygorila> If i wanted to install a package, say tor, how would I do that?
[04:31] <Dheeraj_k> but no body had the answer
[04:31] <Snikles> There is something wrong with the flash player 7/9? Something about CSS layers?
[04:31] <levander> dm: also, are your speakers set on dolby digital sound, and you're only outputting stereo sound?
[04:31] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: What makes you assume I'm English?
[04:31] <somian> zac3 it is the java compiler, iirc
[04:31] <dm> levander once i plug in the headphones, the speakers no longer work
[04:31] <dm> levander how do i check if they are dolby
[04:31] <zac3> type apt-get install xxxx
[04:31] <levander> dm: do the speakers work if you unplug the headphones?
[04:31] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Racial profiling.
[04:31] <deadlygorila> zac3 ty I tried it but it says package/program/whatever not found
[04:31] <AnthonyG> I've been going at this for three days... Killed my Linux partition once , I'm tired of it :(
[04:31] <LjL> Dheeraj_k: not a good enough reason. anyway, i don't know what the difference would be
[04:31] <levander> dm: are you using the digital or analog out on your PC?
[04:32] <deadlygorila> and I can't move anything into my harddrive because it says I don't have permission
[04:32] <zac3> LINUX
[04:32] <dm> levander no the speakers do not work if the headphones are unplugged
[04:32] <AnthonyG> At least it taught me to never , Never touch packages for 2.<6 kernels.
[04:32] <dm> levander no idea if its digital or analog
[04:32] <bimberi> deadlygorila: System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager.  tor is in the universe repository, which you may need to enable ...
[04:32] <bimberi> ubotu: tell deadlygorila about tor | via /msg
[04:33] <Snikles> There is something wrong with the flash player 7/9? Something about CSS layers?
[04:33] <levander> dm: did you plug the speakers into a green port on your computer, or one that has a red light shining out of it, the third common choice is what's called a digital coaxial port
[04:33] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: I scrolled up a bit then got lazy...your modem killed your Linux installation?
[04:33] <zac3> linux penguin
[04:33] <GenNMX> Snikles: Works fine for me.
[04:33] <eneried> hello, does anybody could help me to set my sis video card in ubuntu, i looked at my xorg.conf, and it says the driver for my card is vesa, but my card is a sis...
[04:33] <levander> dm: are you sure you have the speakers plugged into the right port on the PC?
[04:33] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: No, A package for one did.
[04:33] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: Started a massive chain of broken dependencies :(
[04:33] <GenNMX> Snikles: Try Firefox if you aren't already. If you already have, then try Konquorer / Opera / WINE + Internet Explorer
[04:34] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: Then no GNOME components would work.
[04:34] <zac3> how do you use vino (WINE)
[04:34] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: I couldn't do much from the shell aside from a attempt to apt GNOME.
[04:34] <levander> Anyone who has used update-manager to dist-upgrade, are you still given the option to keep old configuration files when they have changed in the packages?  Or, does update-manager "simplify" the process so much, you're aren't given this option?
[04:34] <eneried> how i can configure my X server, i remember there's a command that allow me to do that
[04:34] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Odd, I thought apt-get was smart enough to stop packages from installing that would break. It's always stopped me before.
[04:34] <noclue> well i guess i need to throw away my phone
[04:34] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: Gave up on that, Rebooted. GRUB: Error 17
[04:34] <Snikles> GenNMX, In internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera (in Windows)! It works... but in linux not work :/
[04:35] <levander> eneried: "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-sorg"
[04:35] <noclue> *sigh can't find anything to do the job
[04:35] <bimberi> !xconfig | eneried
[04:35] <ubotu> eneried: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:35] <eneried> thanks levander
[04:35] <shea> here's a join-and-ask for you (i usually hate people who ask to ask so i assume you do too)
[04:35] <GenNMX> Snikles: And all of those are available in Linux. Try different browsers. Linux is not a one-man browser system.
[04:35] <NineTeen67Comet> Does anyone know if adding a 128mb Radeon 9250 PCI video card to this on board video amd 1200 box might help it's speed?
[04:35] <NineTeen67Comet> It get's slower than my 700mhz box does with half the applications open (700mhz, 256mb ram, GeForce2 GTS/Pro vs this AMD Duron 1200, 256mb ram, on board Trident Microsystems CyberBlade/i1 video (does not have any 3D drivers that I can find) ..
[04:35] <dm> levander lol they are laptop speakers, i dont have a choice :P
[04:35] <deadlygorila> hey bim thanks but there is a problem with that
[04:35] <shea> so, on a fresh edgy install, on a blank hard drive, from CD
[04:35] <levander> eneried: note the typo ubotu corrected in my answer
[04:35] <eneried> one question, levander, my mouse is working good, and my keyboard too, does this command could damage those settings?
[04:35] <levander> dm: ah, okay
[04:35] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: qtparted showed the ext3 partition as an unknown allocation.
[04:35] <GenNMX> NineTeen67Comet: If your problem is speed is only gaming, then yes. Otherwise, no.
[04:35] <mofturos> i added a line: alias l='ls -al' in .bash_profile .. but i get bash: l: command not found .. any ideas ?
[04:35] <shea> GRUB starts, loads the menu.lst file properly, and then gives error 15 (file not found)
[04:35] <mofturos> do i have to do anything else ?
[04:36] <shea> device.map is correct.  the paths to the files it needs is correct.  the root device is correct.
[04:36] <bimberi> eneried: yes it could, take a backup of /etc/X11/xorg.conf first
[04:36] <noclue> i have a second hard drive on my machine soley for use with ubuntu why can i not use it?
[04:36] <shea> i'm at a loss.
[04:36] <stormy|> eilker: how do i save it?
[04:36] <GenNMX> shea: Are the files there?
[04:36] <shea> yep.
[04:36] <noclue> my primary drive has ubuntu installed
[04:36] <shea> rw/r/r
[04:36] <deadlygorila> see synaptic doesn't see tor at all and for some reason I can't go online with it
[04:36] <NineTeen67Comet> GenNMX: no games it's too slow even to cruize the net if I get more than a chat window, browser, and terminal going .. it's terrible .. how can this 1200 be so much slower than my 700mhz box with the same amount of ram?
[04:36] <shea> not pointing anywhere weird.  /boot is part of /
[04:36] <shea> ext3
[04:37] <bimberi> !info tor
[04:37] <ubotu> tor: anonymizing overlay network for TCP. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.1.1.23-1 (edgy), package size 763 kB, installed size 1556 kB
[04:37] <GenNMX> NineTeen67Comet: What are the CPU types on the two we're comparing?
[04:37] <air0day> does anyone know how to configure sylpheed-claws to store mail in a specific directory, rather than in subdirectories inside of my home?
[04:37] <AnthonyG> NineTeen67Comet: It's a Celeron hm? XD
[04:37] <Snikles> GenNMX, I did try it in 11 browsers at Windows... and it works in all of them... I did try it in 5 browsers in linux and it don't work in anyone.
[04:37] <eilker> stormy|: do ctrl x , it will ask before it exits
[04:37] <bimberi> ubotu: tell deadlygorila about universe | via /msg
[04:37] <eneried> Ok, i have to work hard now, thanks levander, thanks bimberi
[04:37] <levander> dm: i'm sitting here thinking, that's all i've got to check.  It seems like if sound works in the headphones, it should work in the speakers.  I'd figure out how to check to make sure the sound software (don't even know what Ubuntu uses) is configured just to be on stereo output or something like that..
[04:37] <bimberi> eneried: yw :)
[04:37] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Well, I guess you should be thankful you have a /home partition.
[04:37] <NineTeen67Comet> GenNMX: This AMD Duron vs a 700mhz PIII ..
[04:37] <Snikles> GenNMX, I test the flash player 7 and 9
[04:37] <noclue> can i get a belkin wireless g descktop card to work on ubuntu ??
[04:37] <mofturos> i added a line: alias l='ls -al' in .bash_profile .. but i get bash: l: command not found .. any ideas ?
[04:37] <shea> at the boot menu i've tried hitting 'e' to edit the grub commands, tried (hd1,0), etc (since i do have another disk), but it won't even mount it
[04:37] <phpnuborn> how are uid/gid created?
[04:37] <shea> so it's truly boggling
[04:37] <eneried> one more question, so i need to restart the whole system, or could i only restart the x server?
[04:37] <stormy|> eilker: permission denied, so do i need to do that as sudo?
[04:38] <GenNMX> NineTeen67Comet: Duron was the Celeron of the AMD processors, while PIII was Intel's best architecture before Core Duo.
[04:38] <noclue> i tried ndiswrapper and the apropriate software it just stuffs things up
[04:38] <diocles> mofturos: Run ". .bash_profile" without quotes?
[04:38] <NineTeen67Comet> noclue: I believe you need the RT2500 driver for it ..
[04:38] <Snikles> GenNMX, The flashplayer developers have channel in Freenode?
[04:38] <eilker> stormy|: yes
[04:38] <zac3> how do I get a java applet that I created to work on my webpage
[04:38] <AnthonyG> I despise being stuck in Windows , Please help me :(
[04:38] <GenNMX> Snikles: Try uninstalling the plugin, then re-installing it through Firefox.
[04:38] <bimberi> phpnuborn: when users and groups are created (eg. the adduser & addgroup commands)
[04:38] <NineTeen67Comet> GenNMX: gotchya .. I have a Celeron 2.8gig that sucks too .. lol .. that tells the story .. thanks much ..
[04:38] <edbe> hallo list, how can I install gspca module for a logitech quickcam?
[04:38] <Snikles> GenNMX, I did it. :/
[04:38] <AnthonyG> I've never been so angry with an OS , Or myself rather...
[04:39] <zac3> i tried that and it dosn't work
[04:39] <noclue> nineteen67comet is that for the f5d700 uk ver.6000
[04:39] <mofturos> diocles: what do you man ?
[04:39] <mofturos> mena
[04:39] <mofturos> mean
[04:39] <noclue> f5d7000 i mean
[04:39] <levander> No one in here used update-manager to dist-upgrade?
[04:39] <diocles> mofturos: If you've added the line to .bash_profile, then it will only get read when you next start a login shell.
[04:39] <mofturos> ok
[04:39] <stormy|> okay eilker, i think that worked, i'm going to reboot, just did an update
[04:39] <diocles> mofturos: Perhaps .bashrc is a better place.
[04:39] <GenNMX> Snikles: Email Macromedia.
[04:40] <zac3> how doI compile c++ source code
[04:40] <eilker> stormy|: ok lets see
[04:40] <levander> What do you guys use to dist-upgrade?
[04:40] <mofturos> ok .. ill try that too
[04:40] <bimberi> !compiling | zac3
[04:40] <ubotu> zac3: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[04:40] <Snikles> GenNMX, The flashplayer developers have channel in Freenode?
[04:40] <AnthonyG> zac3: g++
[04:40] <GenNMX> zac3: man gcc; man g++
[04:40] <NineTeen67Comet> noclue: I'm not sure, but I have a belkin at home (8000 miles away in Japan) and if memory serves it was the RT2500 that did it for me . Fire up Synaptic, and search for the rt2500 and it'll tell you what chip sets it covers .. Belkin has a diff name than "belkin" for their chip name .. The forums have some good advice too
[04:40] <air0day> so you can configure something called procmail to download all of my mail from a server, and then various linux mail programs will read from that local mail folder, right?
[04:40] <phpnuborn> does the system assign the uid/gid numbers or the person the creates the user/group?
[04:40] <Snikles> GenNMX, or some kind of suport room?
[04:40] <dm> levander i tampered with teh sound confs, will attempt again tomorrow, thanks for your assitance
[04:40] <Snikles> GenNMX, or some kind of suport chat?
[04:40] <GenNMX> Snikles: I'm not a Flash developer. Try random channels. #macromedia, #flashdev, #flashdevelopment, #flash, whatever.
[04:40] <cong0_natty> you cant handle the flash plugin!
[04:41] <phpnuborn> are uid/gid number just picked out of the air?
[04:41] <GenNMX> In Soviet Russia, the plugin flashes YOU!
[04:41] <craigbass1976> I just tried a HP 3650 in Ubuntu and got the same results I did in Fedora.  No black printing.  Anyone else had this issue with HPs?
[04:41] <AnthonyG> GenMNX: :|
[04:41] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: :|
[04:41] <noclue> i guess i will stay on wires then sounds easier lol
[04:41] <diocles> air0day: fetchmail downloads from a server, but procmail is useful too.
[04:41] <bruenig> hp's are generally perfect as they write drivers for linux
[04:41] <stormy|> actually eilker, one more thing, where to I extract themes?
[04:41] <bimberi> air0day: not sure about procmail but fetchmail does that
[04:41] <cong0_natty> craig you need to have the hp printing daemon
[04:41] <GenNMX> craigbass1976: Make sure you have foomatic installed.
[04:41] <craigbass1976> bruenig, this one's generally cyan though...
[04:42] <eilker> stormy|: themes for ?
[04:42] <robert__> is there a Xfire for Linux
[04:42] <craigbass1976> Can I install xchat while running the livecd?
[04:42] <newguy101> Hi...  I'm trying to map my keyboard and I'm wondering if there's a CLI tool to display raw data from a device
[04:42] <bimberi> craigbass1976: sure
[04:42] <noclue> the hard drive is bugging me mostly
[04:42] <craigbass1976> bimberi, ok.  apt-get install xchat, right?
[04:42] <noclue> can you use a second hard drive with ubuntu??
[04:42] <NineTeen67Comet> I have a java question .. I've got Java installed and running fine .. However University of Phoenix uses aleks.jar for their math class. Their Linux install instructions don't jive with Ubuntu .. where else besides /usr/share/java/ can I put this thing so it'll work when I hit their site with Firefox? Is .jar simple another plugin? And if so, where exactly do I put it for system use? (my wife needs that plugin too) ..
[04:42] <noclue> or is it not the same as xp in that respect?
[04:42] <eilker> stormy|: u mean splash images ?
[04:42] <stormy|> eilker: gnome, www.gnome-look.org
[04:43] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: I'm not exactly sure what to tell you. That's why I make periodic backups of all important files, in case my configuration gets royally screwed up. Windows might be at fault for its System Restore letting viruses in, but it does have that one good point.
[04:43] <bimberi> craigbass1976: yes (although the repositories might need to be enabled - give it a try)
[04:43] <diocles> phpnuborn: The lowest available are chosen by 'adduser', within the usual range.
[04:43] <stormy|> eilker: no, full blown themes
[04:43] <Angela_816_80085> hi all
[04:43] <air0day> bimberi: okay, fetchmail may have been what i meant.  so i can have it download mail and stuff, but then read said mail with a different client?  is there a decent tutorial for morons on that?
[04:43] <diocles> phpnuborn: Or 'useradd'.
[04:43] <violot> Argh, what's the Ubuntu Open channel again?
[04:43] <violot> D'oh!
[04:43] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: My partitions are fine,  My modem isn't :)
[04:43] <eilker> stormy|: wherever u want
[04:43] <stormy|> eilker: how do i install them then?
[04:43] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Oh, I thought you said your distro was dead.
[04:43] <diocles> violot: #ubuntu-classroom for the Ubuntu Open Week.
[04:43] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: It _was_
[04:43] <phpnuborn> so uid/gid can be different from one install to another?
[04:44] <AnthonyG> Past-tense
[04:44] <violot> Just found it diocles, thanks :)
[04:44] <stormy|> eilker:  i think i found it, themes manager>>install>>browse to folder?
[04:44] <diocles> phpnuborn: Yep.
[04:44] <eilker> stormy|:  ok:)
[04:44] <Angela_816_80085> I need a bit of help, Ubuntu works great with everything except my mousewheel in  some GTK applications... anyone know of a twaek to fix the mousewheel? TIA :)
[04:44] <bimberi> air0day: I don't know of one offhand no.  Might only be for dummies though ;p
[04:44] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: And the modem worked before?
[04:44] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: What modem is it again?
[04:44] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: In Linux? No , Here is ModemData: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34685/
[04:45] <dope> is there a peer guardian type program for linux?
[04:45] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: It's an Agere Systems PCI 56K SoftModem (V.92)
[04:45] <FunnyLookinHat> dope, the Tor network has a linux client I believe
[04:45] <nomasteryoda|w> apt-get install tor
[04:45] <dope> tor is like peer guardian?
[04:46] <Angela_816_80085> tor is a hacker tool for getting porn undetected
[04:46] <clarity_> has anyone had any problems other than myself with the screen software that comes with ubuntu?
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[04:46] <clarity_> it doesn't copy/paste stuff correctly
[04:46] <clarity_> either that or vim doesn't work right
[04:46] <somian> I Haven't tried it yet, clarity_
[04:46] <somian> You are using vim ...
[04:46] <bruenig> does anyone have a default edgy sources.list and is willing to pastebin it. I just want to look at it. I don't want to use it, so please no 'use source-o-matic' responses
[04:46] <newguy101> Hi...  I'm trying to map my keyboard and I'm wondering if there's a CLI tool to display raw data from a device
[04:46] <Angela_816_80085> clarity_ I have same problem, but only with the same applications that wont let me croll with my mousewheel
[04:47] <somian> clarity_:  use the right setup, :set paste
[04:47] <clarity_> hrm
[04:47] <somian> It's a PEBKAC, not a problem with Vin or Ubuntu, I bet
[04:47] <clarity_> is there a patch for it?
[04:47] <somian> Yes, there
[04:47] <somian> is a fix: read the f* Vim documentation ;-)
[04:48] <clarity_> hrm
[04:48] <diocles> clarity_: What exactly is wrong with the pasting? Is it tabs?
[04:48] <air0day> how do i completely uninstall something i isntalled with apt-get install?
[04:48] <Zazrael> air0day: sudo apt-get remove packagename
[04:48] <nomasteryoda|w> apt-get remove ?
[04:48] <AnthonyG> air0day: apt-get remove
[04:48] <clarity_> somian: thanks so much
[04:48] <bruenig> air0day, what do you mean by completely uninstall, does that include purging configuration files?
[04:48] <Angela_816_80085> air0day or use synaptic
[04:48] <clarity_> diocles: yeah tabs are broken
[04:48] <somian> clarity_: let me guess ... when you try to paste, you get stair-stepping.
[04:49] <diocles> clarity_: That'll be it, then.
[04:49] <clarity_> yeah
[04:49] <air0day> bruenig: no, but is there something i can do that nukes config files as well?
[04:49] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: So, any more details?
[04:49] <somian> :set paste , then paste, then :set nopaste
[04:49] <phpnuborn> can the rows/columns used in text mode be changed?
[04:49] <clarity_> does :set paste make it so it doesn't auto indent for code?
[04:49] <Angela_816_80085> it is a usb mouse
[04:49] <Angela_816_80085> logitec
[04:49] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: I was thinking more about applications.
[04:49] <Angela_816_80085> infared
[04:49] <bruenig> air0day, sudo aptitude purge package
[04:49] <Angela_816_80085> gtkedit
[04:49] <air0day> danke
[04:49] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: Have you tried http://linmodems.org/ by the way? I has a scanModem tool for the chipset.
[04:49] <somian> That' right. "paste" turns a bunch of things off so that pasting works right.
[04:49] <bimberi> air0day: or even: apt-get remove --purge package
[04:50] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: Hence ModemData...
[04:50] <Angela_816_80085> and rox-filer
[04:50] <clarity_> oh
[04:50] <clarity_> can I have my cake and eat it too?
[04:50] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Not gedit?
[04:50] <Angela_816_80085> no, I am in Xubuntu
[04:50] <Angela_816_80085> no g anything for me
=== [1] raknam is now known as raknam
[04:50] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: I apologize if I sound rude, I'm out of coffee and this modem is bothering me...Greatly
[04:50] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Apart from gtk*, right? :)
[04:50] <somian> OUT of COFFEE!?! ... {shudder}
[04:51] <phpnuborn> can the rows/columns used in text mode be changed?  is it fixed?
[04:51] <stormy|> eilker:  I downloaded the blue swirl theme on www.gnome-look.com, how do i install it? I used gdmsetup like it said, but it doesn't show up in the themes list
[04:51] <Vigor> brueing: http://www.kernel.org/ Is a list of all the kernals
[04:51] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Ouch, these are gtk1.2 apps.
[04:51] <AnthonyG> somian: I'm going into with-drawal :(
[04:51] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: I'm also on EFNet...let's just say you're not rude and leave it at that. So, were you able to at least find out the chipset type?
[04:51] <bruenig> gnome-look.com is parked
[04:51] <Angela_816_80085> d
[04:51] <eilker> stormy|:  i really dont remember, i use kubuntu at the moment
[04:52] <wastrel> "Ubunto"
[04:52] <somian> It's a scenario so hideous and terrifying that I hate to even contemplate it, AnthonyG ;-)
[04:52] <Angela_816_80085> yea, I use x ubuntu
[04:52] <air0day> how can i change the directory Sylpheed looks in when storing or displaying mail? right now it looks in my home directory
[04:52] <somian> Angela_816_80085: how do you like it?
[04:52] <Angela_816_80085> nice
[04:52] <AnthonyG> GemNMX: I was as well ,Until I got tired of them :)
[04:52] <stormy|> oh okay, thanks anyway eilker, i'll reboot and try it later
[04:52] <Angela_816_80085> verrry fast
[04:52] <somian> It's using xfce right?
[04:52] <bruenig> it is extremely fast. I love thunar
[04:52] <eilker> stormy|:  ok
[04:52] <Angela_816_80085> I came from KANOTIX this morning
[04:53] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Scrolling doesn't work for me in gtkedit either.
[04:53] <Angela_816_80085> you guys are just as fast, but newer apps :)
[04:53] <Angela_816_80085> diocles , nope, no luck scrolling in gtkedit
[04:53] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Unless I scroll while over the scrollbar.
[04:53] <robert__> can i use a Dapper Drake Ubuntu package in Edgy Ubuntu
[04:53] <MtJB> does edgy have a configuration tool that allows you to select a monitor from it?  like when you get a new monitor and don't want to hack xorg.conf?
[04:53] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: Here is the scanModem Dump : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34685/
[04:53] <bruenig> robert_, generally, what package are you considering?
[04:54] <h00t> hi guys i have a problem my mplayer plugin in firefox isn't working although i know it's installed ... anyone??
[04:54] <GenNMX> AnthonyG: What about lspci -vv ? Does it list it?
[04:54] <Angela_816_80085> OMG!!!LOL!!! thanks diocles  :)
[04:54] <bruenig> !doesn't work | h00t
[04:54] <ubotu> h00t: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[04:54] <Angela_816_80085> it works
[04:54] <noclue> can you run windows software on ubuntu???
[04:54] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: It'll be an obscure gtk1.2 thing. :/
[04:54] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: Bah, Let me reboot , Please stay online :)
[04:54] <Angela_816_80085> what a crappy application :p
[04:54] <MtJB> noclue, yes
[04:54] <levander> noclue: wine
[04:54] <bruenig> !wine | noclue
[04:54] <ubotu> noclue: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:54] <Angela_816_80085> diocles , can you recomend a light text editor?
[04:55] <MtJB> gedit
[04:55] <wastrel> hmm
[04:55] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: vim supports scrolling with the mouse. ;)
[04:55] <h00t> bruenig, when i go this site http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/test.html   ... the media that should play doesn't
[04:55] <wastrel> Angela_816_80085:  gaphical or command line?
[04:55] <Angela_816_80085> I dont want to install half of gnome for a notepad clone :p
[04:55] <wastrel> graphical even
[04:55] <Angela_816_80085> yea, i like GUI
[04:55] <bruenig> h00t, they all don't work or some don;t?
[04:55] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: XFCE already uses Gtk+.
[04:56] <Angela_816_80085> I am in IceWM
[04:56] <h00t> all of them ... basically i installed mplayer plugin (which should play most of that media) but it's like browser doesn't see it or something
[04:56] <Angela_816_80085> , I only have 256 ream, I am as lightweight as they get :p
[04:56] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Which other desktop apps do you use, then? Perhaps half of GNOME is already in memory?
[04:56] <Angela_816_80085> 256ram
[04:56] <bruenig> h00t, type about:plugins into the address bar, see what it has listed
[04:57] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: I mean, gvim is graphical... erm...
[04:57] <Angela_816_80085> blender 3d, xterm, bitchx, gimp, and Inkscape on rare occasions
[04:57] <GenNMX> Angela_816_80085: With 256 you'll have to cut gnome back some on pretty colours.
[04:57] <Angela_816_80085> yea, i went with xubuntu, no KDE or gnome for me :p
[04:57] <Vigor> BOOBS: Ever tried NoteTab? its from Fookes, I havent tried it on Ubuntu,,yet,,,but it is my fave text editor, free and commercial versions, the free one does just about anything.
[04:58] <stormy|> eilker:  I fixed the startup dealie i think; is there any way to have a "perform list" for X-Chat?
[04:58] <bruenig> Angela_816_80085, ubuntu-lite has IceWM by default although I doubt it is as good or polished as xubuntu
[04:58] <Angela_816_80085> ooo cool :)
[04:58] <h00t> bruenig, only java, flash & shockwave  ... but i swear it's checked in add/remove dialog
[04:58] <bruenig> h00t, open a terminal, and do sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer, see what it says
[04:59] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: I bet gedit doesn't actually depend on much more than Gtk+.
[04:59] <Angela_816_80085> h00t also try VLC.. it is cool too :p
[04:59] <Angela_816_80085> diocles , ok thanks :) I will try it :)
[04:59] <h00t> Angela_816_80085, i need to play a stream
[04:59] <diocles> Um, actually, I might be wrong. Ho hum.
[04:59] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: But no more than the GIMP.
[04:59] <Angela_816_80085> VLC is made just for streaming h00t
[05:00] <bruenig> Angela_816_80085, he needs a plugin
[05:00] <Angela_816_80085> and it is lightweight
[05:00] <somian> Thanks for the chat and the help ... going to reboot now and try to enable persistence using this sekret boot cheatcode
[05:00] <Angela_816_80085> oh!
[05:00] <Angela_816_80085> sorry, no VLC plugin
[05:00] <somian> .oO("persistence")

[05:00] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:00] <Angela_816_80085> you can drag and drop from firefox and opera tho :p
[05:01] <bruenig> h00t, what did it output when you did sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer?
[05:01] <h00t> bruenig, 0 new installed ... i already got it
[05:01] <stormy|> eilker: sorry to be a nag if it seems this way... can i make my own packages with dpkg?
[05:01] <h00t> newest version
[05:01] <umista> ok when i go into my computer, how can i like my 160gig drive there to a folder names /media/backup_1
[05:01] <umista> like > link
[05:01] <eilker> stormy|:  perform list ?
[05:01] <h00t> what could it be ... i upgraded the whole OS
[05:01] <bruenig> h00t, ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins, see if it is in there
[05:01] <Angela_816_80085> I am free!!
[05:02] <romeo_> nice
[05:02] <ac7ss> Could anyone tell me what WM is the smallest in overhead? (Still has to be user friendly.)
[05:02] <stormy|> eilker: a set of commands that are performed upon execution
[05:02] <eilker> stormy|:  yes u can create your packages
[05:02] <Angela_816_80085> ac7ss I like IceWM
[05:02] <kishan> h00t:remove the m-player and m-player plugin and reinstall it
[05:02] <Angela_816_80085> fluxbox is small too
[05:02] <atoponce> ac7ss: evilwm
[05:02] <prestosd> how can I get evolution to recognize a name of a contact so I don't have to type in there address?
[05:02] <bruenig> ac7ss, I would go with xfce myself, but IceWM and fluxbox are lighter, but I think they lose a bit of functionality imo of course
[05:03] <atoponce> ac7ss: lightest i have ever seen. now user friendly... that's another ball game... :)
[05:03] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:03] <h00t> bruenig, there are buncha files in pluging directory and lot of them have mplayer-blabalb.*
[05:03] <Angela_816_80085> yea IceWM and fluxbox are pretty Raw...
[05:03] <Angela_816_80085> but you get used to it
[05:03] <h00t> bruenig, so i guess it's there
[05:03] <stormy|> i guess what i'm saying eilker, is how do I install from a .tar.bz2?
[05:03] <romeo_> flux is fuctional
[05:03] <diocles> CientificoLoco: Tut, tut, that's three times.
[05:03] <romeo_> functional
[05:03] <atoponce> Angela_816_80085: yeah. any lighn wv is going to take some getting used to
[05:03] <bruenig> h00t, that is odd. You don't have two firefoxes do you. Maybe used one of those scripts that installed the latest firefox or the official firefox as opposed to the ubuntu one
[05:03] <h00t> could it be a rights issue
[05:04] <diocles> CientificoLoco: How have you installed amsn?
[05:04] <atoponce> s/lighn/light/
[05:04] <EduNotWork> can I get help with edubuntu here?

[05:08] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:08] <bruenig> prestosd, why don't you figure it out. You are such a genius that you came into IRC to help with figuring out a preference on a gui application, you clearly are the most superior linux user ever, you ought to be able to handle it
[05:08] <prestosd> diocles, did you change any particular settings?
[05:08] <AnthonyG> GenNMX: I didn't run it as root , But I doubt capabilities would be of much use. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34688/
[05:08] <Angela_816_80085> when I boot, I get an error "unclean file system" , how dose it know that my boyfriend was looking at naked people again?
[05:08] <diocles> prestosd: I might be using a more recent version.
[05:08] <prestosd> bruenig, What the hay are you talking about?
[05:08] <SperMite> Is there a way where i can make my windows ntfs drive writeable ? i believe its under hd1?
[05:08] <noclue> can i run my nertwork card through wine???
[05:09] <Angela_816_80085> noclue yes
[05:09] <prestosd> diocles, what version are you using?
[05:09] <noclue> cool
[05:09] <EduNotWork> atoponce: I'm registering nickname
[05:09] <Angela_816_80085> I play halflife on wine
[05:09] <diocles> prestosd: Try Edit > Preferences > Autocompletion, and make sure they're all selected.
[05:09] <Angela_816_80085> ^online
[05:09] <prestosd> diocles, im using 2.8.1
[05:09] <prestosd> k
[05:09] <prestosd> ill try that
[05:09] <diocles> prestosd: Snap, then. I'm on Feisty.
[05:10] <atoponce> EduNotWork: sounds good. or go to #ubuntu-freshers. it's not noisy there
[05:10] <prestosd> diocles, there all selected
[05:10] <prestosd> :(
[05:10] <Jordan_U> noclue: No, just windows applications, you can use an app that does the same sort of thing for wireless drivers called NDIS wrapper, unless you just mean can you go online with an application running in wine in which case, yes.
[05:10] <noclue> how do you do that
[05:10] <Angela_816_80085> diocles , have you tried Rox-filer? it is verry nice :)
[05:10] <wastrel> what's freshers
[05:10] <bruenig> h00t, did you figure it out?
[05:11] <ac7ss> Thanks
[05:11] <prestosd> diocles, snap?
[05:11] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: I can't say I have.
[05:11] <prestosd> diocles, im on edgy
[05:11] <stormy|> eilker:  what is the wildcard command in Terminal?
[05:12] <diocles> prestosd: Mm, mine are selected. I'll see what turning them off does.
[05:12] <Angela_816_80085> diocles , give it a try, it is the fastest filemanager I know of, it even supports icons :)
[05:12] <prestosd> k
[05:12] <h00t> bruenig, do you know what's the name of the gui filebrowser i want to start it in root
[05:12] <Jordan_U> stormy|: *
[05:12] <h00t> is it nautilus
[05:12] <noclue> i think maybee wine is not installed properly because i have an exe file to open but there is no way that i can open it with or without wine
[05:12] <Angela_816_80085> apt-get rox-filer
[05:12] <stormy|> thanks eilker
[05:12] <noclue> have i done it wrong?
[05:12] <harisund> h00t: yes, nautilus
[05:12] <XiXaQ> noclue, how do you run it?
[05:13] <prestosd> diocles, while checking......try out this cool link: www.msfirefox.com
[05:13] <prestosd> lol
[05:13] <bruenig> h00t, gksudo nautilus, if you copy and paste the following command, it should all work though, sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug* /opt/firefox/plugins/
[05:13] <prestosd> !spam
[05:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about spam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:13] <Angela_816_80085> You can make rox into a desktop ,with wallpaper and Icons too with a comandline switch
[05:13] <prestosd> drat
[05:13] <diocles> prestosd: Mm, deselecting them stops them autocompleting.
[05:13] <Vigor> I loaded Desktop/generic version on install, to upgrade or change to a server is the other ISO needed, or can it all be done from inside Edgy current config?
[05:13] <noclue> xixaq i have tried double click on exe and right click options so far
[05:13] <eilker> stormy|:  np
[05:13] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:13] <prestosd> how does your autocompleting work?
[05:13] <Jordan_U> noclue: wine < path to the .exe >
[05:14] <XiXaQ> noclue, try running wine <program name>.exe from the terminal. You might get some messages in return.
[05:14] <Jordan_U> noclue: Not all applications work without hacking, some not at all.
[05:14] <diocles> prestosd: I have to type the first three or so characters...
[05:14] <noclue> so     wine setup_1.30.55.exe
[05:14] <Angela_816_80085> can anyone suggest a nice lightweight front end for xmame?, I tryed the debian GXmame but it is broken :/
[05:14] <prestosd> diocles, then do you press a special key?
[05:15] <Jordan_U> noclue: If you are in the correct folder than yes.
[05:15] <diocles> prestosd: No, it magically appears.

[05:15] <Apollo> i am getting a notice in terminal after update, bad header, it skipped some files and ignored some. when i edited my sources.list i removed the hash marks, could that be the problem?
[05:15] <prestosd> diocles, i opened the compose message window
[05:15] <prestosd> and when i type in the to: box it doesnt do anything
[05:16] <noclue> jordan_u do i just type that in terminal then??
[05:16] <prestosd> diocles, is that the wrong place?
[05:16] <Angela_816_80085> I have only had Xubuntu for 4 hours, and I already have everything I need installed and running 8), nice distro guys :)
[05:16] <Angela_816_80085> ^and girls too
[05:16] <prestosd> Angela_816_80085, lol
[05:16] <bruenig> Angela_816_80085, you should look at the ubuntu women part of the forum and start reading away. It will only take you 2 min to read through the 8 posts
[05:17] <Jordan_U> Apollo: Yes, those hash marks tell it to ignore that line, any comments like " this is to enable the blah die blah" are now trying to be read as commands instead of ignored
[05:17] <Angela_816_80085> a womens thread? what a sexist idea :/
[05:17] <bruenig> Angela_816_80085, it was a great idea so say the defenders, it will for sure bring women to ubuntu. Many months later, only 8 or 9 threads
[05:17] <diocles> prestosd: It should work. I can't see it as a bug on launchpad.
[05:17] <Apollo> ok so i should edit those back in. ok thanks
[05:17] <noclue> keeps saying it cant do it
[05:17] <prestosd> diocles, it doesnt
[05:18] <diocles> prestosd: Check that when you click on the 'To:' button you can find everyone in there.
[05:18] <noclue> aaaaarrrgh i cant get used to this lol :D
[05:18] <Vigor> Angela_816_BOOBS: Its the sweetest distro of Linux I have used ever, that last was like 3 years ago, but this one is sweet.
[05:18] <prestosd> hmm
[05:18] <prestosd> diocles, AH HA!!!
[05:18] <prestosd> diocles, WHEN I clicked that to button noone is there!
[05:18] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:18] <prestosd> diocles, How do I get them in there?
[05:18] <h00t> bruenig, it works  ... thank you thank you
[05:18] <diocles> prestosd: Check the category, first.
[05:18] <Angela_816_80085> yea, i am happy with ubuntu sofar... I just have to get wine working now for it to be a perfect install
[05:18] <fnf> Hi, I'm looking for a GNOME applet like Dictionary which can do Google search, does anyone have an idea ?
[05:18] <EduNotWork> Does anyone know how to get other machines to boot Edubuntu..from a machine which has the workstation install of Edubuntu?
[05:19] <diocles> prestosd: It defaults to 'Anniversary', here.
[05:19] <XiXaQ> noclue, for instance. I have mirc.exe (I don't), in /home/joerlend/.wine/mirc/, I then type wine /home/joerlend/.wine/mirc/mirc.exe
[05:19] <h00t> bruenig, it was the automatix ... i will never use it againa
[05:19] <prestosd> diocles, i changed it to any category and there still isnt anyone
[05:19] <diocles> prestosd: But should default to 'Any Category'.
[05:19] <Vigor> Its never perfect, whats the fun in that?:)
[05:19] <bruenig> h00t, that is why we have this fun factoid
[05:19] <Angela_816_80085> do I have a firewall with Xubuntu by default?
[05:19] <diocles> prestosd: Ah, okay, there's your problem.
[05:19] <bruenig> !automatix | h00t
[05:19] <ubotu> h00t: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:19] <fnf> Anyone, please ? Or how can I configure Dictionary to search on Google ?
[05:19] <noclue> xixac i have the file on desktop so do i need to put desktop before the file??
[05:19] <XiXaQ> noclue, You can't do that! <-- Does it say that, or something else?
[05:19] <edbe> anybody has problem with camorama?
[05:19] <prestosd> diocles, hmm, so how do i fix it?
[05:19] <diocles> prestosd: So, check your address book.

[05:22] <Apollo> Jordan_U: i just edited my sources.list and updated like you suggested and all is good thnk you!
[05:22] <reverseblade> Angela_816_80085, it doesn't have the extensions like FF
[05:22] <tonyyarusso> Angela_816_80085: It's nice for many things, yes.  I've stuck with Firefox b/c it's a) FLOSS (Opera is proprietary) and b) has some extensions I like.
[05:22] <diocles> prestosd: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/63470 <-- is it like that?
[05:22] <reverseblade> Angela_816_80085, though it is choice, and choices are good
[05:22] <GenNMX> Everyone using Linux should try out Swiftfox if you're currently using Firefox, it's goal is optimization.
[05:22] <Hyouketsu> do you guys have a favorite music player?
[05:22] <Angela_816_80085> yea, I like my firefox extensions
[05:22] <prestosd> diocles, let me look.......

[05:24] <CientificoLoco> hello, everybody I have installed the last version of amsn with autop.  the manager installation ended ok, but when I wanna open never apper. what do I have to do?
[05:24] <bruenig> noclue, make sure you have the path to setup_1.3*, wine /path/to/setup*
[05:24] <GenNMX> noodles12: Search Synaptic for packages. Ubuntu doesn't have a whole lot by itself, you'll probably need to install a different program. But it IS out there.
[05:24] <XiXaQ> noclue, why have you placed the exe file there?
[05:24] <robert__> can i install Shockwave in Ubuntu
[05:25] <noclue> xixaq i don't understand is probrably why lol
[05:25] <XiXaQ> noclue, make sure you're in the correct directory (folder).
[05:25] <CientificoLoco> how do I intall the last version of amsn?
[05:25] <diocles> prestosd: I mean, it suggests that --force-shutdown should fix it.
[05:25] <prestosd> diocles, K ill try that..........
[05:25] <noclue> xixaq could you run me through this like you would a 10 year old i may understand then lmao :)
[05:25] <XiXaQ> noclue, copy an exe-file to ~/yourusername, then open a terminal window and type wine ~/yourusername/program.exe
[05:25] <noodles12> this wink program looks interesting
[05:26] <diocles> CientificoLoco: You could wait for the latest version to get packaged.
[05:26] <Hexidigital_> hi guys... is there a dpkg-reconfigure i can run for a server install to readjust the vga size?

[05:27] <diocles> Oh, right.

[05:28] <XiXaQ> noclue, activate your remote desktop, and I'll have a look. System > Preferences > Remote desktop. Let other users see your desktop: yes, allow them to control it, yes. Ask for confirmation: yes.
[05:28] <prestosd> diocles, Ran the force shutdown command, started it back up...and still no go
[05:28] <nomasteryoda|w> yup quintin
[05:28] <diocles> Hexidigital_: The size of the framebuffer is set at boot, I think.
[05:28] <nomasteryoda|w> buggy it is
[05:28] <nomasteryoda|w> but works
[05:28] <diocles> prestosd: File a bug. ;)
[05:28] <Hexidigital_> diocles: that's what i was afraid of :)

[05:37] <raj> i did that after that what i do
[05:37] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Also, I've just parsed your nick.
[05:38] <bimberi> nomin: that looks like an error in the file.  Open it in a text editor and put the first 10 lines or so on a pastebin
[05:38] <Angela_816_80085> what is parsed?
[05:38] <diocles> I'm far too naive for this channel.
[05:38] <nomin> bimberi, ok
[05:38] <romeo_> w30, thank you I'll try that
[05:38] <ivx> raj what do you need it to do? go to /var/www (i think it is) and put you html or whatever files in there
[05:38] <rbil> raj: http://localhost
[05:38] <maccabeus> ivx, sweet -- thx -- still learning irc
[05:38] <maccabeus> ivx, i do know servers though -- are you planning on running hardware raid for yourserver?
[05:38] <craigbass1976> Ok, I've now installed ubuntu, and can't get black to work on my hp 3650.  It didn't work off the live cd, so I wasn't expecting it to now, but needed installed ubuntu to mess with it.  I'm using hte hpijs driver, but someone said something about foomatic.  Where to go from here?
[05:38] <nomin> bimberi, I used the gwget download manager to get the file today.  Maybe it screwed it up.
[05:38] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Read and understood. Pretty much.
[05:39] <ivx> maccabeus, i don't know what all i am going to do, depends on how much money it will all cost
[05:39] <w30> romeo_, I picked Deskjet 3520 and the hpijs driver was inatalled.
[05:39] <Angela_816_80085> oh :)
[05:39] <Angela_816_80085> it kept saying my name was taken
[05:39] <raj> ivx how can put html  ther is anu commamd
[05:39] <maccabeus> ok, well if cost is a major issue, sata will be cheaper
[05:40] <diocles> Angela_816_80085: Well, that's one way of getting around it.
[05:40] <ivx> raj, you can just drag them over,
[05:40] <Angela_816_80085> :)
[05:40] <nomin> bimberi, I can't open it with gedit.
[05:40] <maccabeus> ivx, scsi will give you much better io/performance
[05:40] <Angela_816_80085> I almost used my birthday
[05:40] <craigbass1976> Aw DUDE!!! Ubuntu comes with Freecell!!!
[05:40] <bimberi> nomin: any error?
[05:40] <maccabeus> ivx, go with ultra320, 15000rpm or better
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[05:40] <Angela_816_80085> craigbass1976 ??what?
[05:40] <ivx> maccabeus, the goal is to keep it under 750, so i am going to see how much i can get for that
[05:40] <romeo_> w30, yes that's how I did it.... I even disabled bidirectional mode via windows
[05:41] <bimberi> craigbass1976: of course :)
[05:41] <nomin> yes, it can't read the ecoding.  It asks to chage it from utf-8 to western-iso and it still doesn't open.
[05:41] <bimberi> lol diocles
[05:41] <ivx> maccabeus, it will just be lamp, for a personal project, so it doesn't have to be that great
[05:41] <romeo_> w30: but still nothing. :(
[05:41] <craigbass1976> Man, I searched through the fedora yum repos and couldn't find it.  If I can get this damned printer working, I'm totally switching over.
[05:41] <ivx> raj, what else do you need to setup, do you have a domain or anything?
[05:41] <nomin> is wget more reliable than gwget?
[05:42] <wastrel> what printer craigbass1976
[05:42] <diocles> craigbass1976: Try System > Administration > Printing.
[05:42] <craigbass1976> HP 3650 anyone? aint printing black? works fine in windows?
[05:42] <Angela_816_80085> nomin yes
[05:42] <bimberi> nomin: what's the output of 'file et-linux-2.60.x86.run' ?
[05:42] <maccabeus> ivx, i'd find a solid sata drive then -- or fast ide
[05:42] <noclue> how do i get onto #winehq  ?
[05:42] <raj> ivx, i am confused which file & where are the located
[05:42] <craigbass1976> wastrel, it's a deskjet 3650
[05:42] <bimberi> noclue: /join #winehq
[05:42] <maccabeus> ivx, since it's a personal project, i'd add scsi later if you have to
[05:42] <nomin> bimberi, "./et-linux-2.60.x86.run: exported SGML document text"
=== Derek__ is now known as Derek
[05:42] <romeo_> might the printer support be better in Edgy? ir so, I'll upgrade.
[05:42] <maccabeus> ivx, keep cost down to begin with...
[05:42] <w30> romeo_, pick local printer and pick use a dected printer?
[05:43] <ivx> raj, hold on i'll look up what the path is by default, you can always change it later
[05:43] <maccabeus> ivx, then ramp it up later
[05:43] <Angela_816_80085> sounds like you tweaked your mime types nomin
[05:43] <bimberi> nomin: that doesn't look like it's supposed to be executed

[05:43] <wastrel> craigbass1976:  http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-DeskJet_3650
[05:43] <craigbass1976> diocles, it recognizes the printer fine, and even prints.  Only in blue though, not using the black cartridge at all
[05:43] <nomin> Angela_816_80085, I don't recall messing with mime types
[05:43] <ivx> raj, the path is /var/www/
[05:43] <romeo_> w30, that's the funny thing,,,, when I choose the "local" dot, all I get is LPT1 and so forth, no USB listed.
[05:43] <diocles> craigbass1976: Darn. Nothing's ever simple.
[05:43] <tang^> I have my mail going into a maildir folder for use with mutt. I wanted to try Evolution using that same maildir folder, but I can't seem to select a folder for Evolution to use. is there some special trick?
[05:44] <wiseelben> craigbass1976: try printing in greyscale mode
[05:44] <nomin> bimberi and Angela_816_80085:  what can I do to fix this?
[05:44] <ivx> raj so just put all your files there, then when you go to http://localhost, you site will come up
[05:44] <ac7ss> now I am trying to start using MSN messenger under Gaim. (I don't have an account set up already)
[05:44] <craigbass1976> I guess I hadn't tried that yet in Ubuntu, but messed with all sorts of color/bw and dpi settings in fedora.  All blue...
[05:44] <ivx> maccabeus, yes i have no idea what i am going to end up doing, it all depends on if i can get some great sales
[05:45] <bimberi> nomin: i don't know sorry.  perhaps redownload using another method
[05:45] <maccabeus> ivx, you wanting to sell things from your server/site?
[05:45] <wiseelben> craigbass1976: according to http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-DeskJet_3650, your printer will only work in either all color or all black
[05:45] <tiptip> hello, i'm working by a 'howto' and it says "First install xvkbd and xvindkeys" -> "sudo apt-get install xvkbd xbindkeys" but i get "Package xvkbd is not available, but is referred to by another package." and "Package xvkbd is not available, but is referred to by another package."  , how i solve that ?
[05:46] <nomin> bimberi, does it look to you like the file has unrepairable errors?
[05:46] <Angela_816_80085> before he left, i streached plastic wrap over his toilet bowl, under the seat. he wet himself before work :p
[05:46] <wiseelben> so if it's forced to use all black using gray scale, then that should work..
[05:46] <ivx> maccabeus, no actually i have a server setup now, and I am just playing with php, MySQL and all that, i don't know if i will every actually make anything, lol
[05:46] <Angela_816_80085> oops, wrong window, sorry
[05:46] <bimberi> nomin: i don't know
[05:46] <hangfire> when I click on a link in my IRC client, it opens in a html editor. How can I change the default so it opens in a regular browser?

[05:46] <w30> romeo_, My setup doesn't even identify the device, it just calls it Deskjet-3520
[05:46] <ivx> maccabeus, i am just having fun learning stuff

[06:00] <LiquidNerd> edbe: what's your cam?
[06:00] <edbe> logitech laptop deluxe
[06:00] <Ilovemypuppy> catsy, because cedega is a crap product

[06:01] <LiquidNerd> well if you're running a new kernel, that would be the problem.. is the image grey/black?
[06:01] <craigbass1976> raj, you would do a mount -t smbfs //192.168.0.1/Documents /mnt where the ip and Documents were the ip and share name on the target box, and /mnt is where you mount it up on your linux box
[06:01] <Vigor> edbe: That be Dapper Drake
[06:01] <Ilovemypuppy> catsy, yeah, windows runs windows programs better than its half-wit emu
[06:01] <edbe> okey ... I'm totally new to webcam stuff ... but it seems the device is recognized
[06:01] <edbe> but, camorama says that /dev/video0 is not there
[06:01] <LiquidNerd> oh it's not even finding it?
[06:01] <reverseblade> When my computer is idle, beagle uses 70% of my cpu, is there a fix for this ?

[06:02] <craigbass1976> raj, last time I tried it though, in Fedora, the smbfs didn't work and I had to use cifs, which I guess has replaced smbfs
[06:02] <edbe> do I need to mknode it?
[06:02] <mordof> anyone know how stable XGL is, and weither or not it'll work with my intel 945GM onboard?

[06:02] <craigbass1976> raj, that help?  took me a while to type it, sorry; I just saw your reply
[06:02] <LiquidNerd> edbe: you should do a 'sudo tail -f /var/log/messages' and see what it says whenyou plug in the camera

[06:04] <diocles> edbe: It would be useful to have the line from lsusb or lspci that mentions your webcam.
[06:04] <craigbass1976> raj, ?
[06:04] <edbe> let's see
[06:04] <daya> ubotu, thanks i will see it
[06:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks i will see it - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:04] <edbe> Bus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:08d8 Logitech, Inc.
[06:04] <edbe> it is recognized
[06:04] <Munchkinguy> bye
[06:05] <raj> i dont uderstand what you type command or anything
[06:05] <diocles> edbe: Okay, now you google for 046d:08d8 ;)
[06:05] <mordof> reverseblade: yeah... hmm
[06:05] <LiquidNerd> ubotu kernel version
[06:05] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kernel version - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:05] <LiquidNerd> ubotu kernel
[06:05] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[06:05] <britt> guys, I have some processes that are taking up like 86% of my CPU, but top wont show me that process. rebooting takes care of the problem for several weeks, but will eventually come up again. I think im not closing something down and it freaks out and goes into neutron star explosion mode
[06:05] <deadlygorila> hey everyone is it possible to change your mac address in ubuntu?
[06:05] <edbe> okey .. the modules isnot running in fact
[06:05] <reverseblade> britt, how top doesn't show it ?
[06:05] <britt> how can i get top o show all of my processes
[06:06] <LiquidNerd> britt: are you leaving Firefox open?
[06:06] <daya> ubotu, I want to do thru ndiswrapper, have u any idea about it.
[06:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I want to do thru ndiswrapper, have u any idea about it. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:06] <dope> I have an nvidia Geforce Go 6100, which linux drivers do i get?
[06:06] <britt> LiquidNerd: no X window, only console
[06:06] <britt> reverseblade: i only see my naim session which is like 16%
[06:06] <thevenin> daya: ubotu is a bot, i triggered the command to tell you that website
[06:06] <LiquidNerd> britt: wow.. I've never heard of that happening without X

[06:06] <reverseblade> britt, tried ps  aux ?
[06:07] <craigbass1976> raj, on the windows box, you need to know the ip and the share name.  Are you really new, or kind of know your way around?  get the ip in a dos window.  in My Computer, right click on the share and click sharing and security to get the exact share name.  Probnably Documents or SharedDocs
[06:07] <britt> dang, i didnt run screen
[06:07] <britt> hold on
[06:07] <reverseblade> britt, when I run top, I can see the processes by root also
[06:08] <diocles> edbe: I assume you've found the forum post. Does the spca5xx driver work?
[06:08] <edbe> damned! I got this:
[06:08] <edbe> [17181538.584000]  Linux video capture interface: v1.00
[06:08] <edbe> [17181538.588000]  usbcore: registered new driver gspca
[06:08] <edbe> [17181538.588000]  /root/gspcav1-20060925/gspca_core.c: gspca driver 01.00.04 registered
[06:08] <edbe> but still camorama says /dev/video0 is closed
[06:08] <strav> hi there! I'm just wondering a simple thing: where is the .asoundrc or .asoundrc.asoundconf file in dapper? (I check for my home dir or for /etc (asound.conf) couldn't find any although I guess ubuntu uses asoundconf for alsa configuration, where the hell is the config file?
[06:08] <bobbie__4> I'm here now. Everything is under control.
[06:08] <edbe> but still camorama says /dev/video0 is closed/non-existant
[06:09] <raj>  i am new just starting study linux
[06:09] <diocles> edbe: That doesn't look right.
[06:09] <edbe> diocles, spca5xx is now gspca
[06:09] <rbil> raj: to access Windoze shares .... do you want the easy way or the hard way?
[06:09] <diocles> Oh. I'm so out of the loop.
[06:09] <edbe> I suspect that it is gnome-kde issue
[06:09] <edbe> ekiga is gnome & camorama is kde ... so it clashes or whatever
[06:09] <britt> who was i talking to about ps aux
[06:09] <craigbass1976> raj, ok.  And when you respond, type my name so it's nice and red for me.  If you just type craig and hit tab, it should finish for you.
[06:10] <edbe> diocles, what other app that is similar to camorama?
[06:10] <strav> any clue for the location of the main alsa config file?
[06:10] <edbe> a video capturing thing
[06:10] <diocles> edbe: The Linux drivers are a lot lower level than GNOME/KDE.
[06:10] <britt> edbe: have you checked out kino
[06:11] <edbe> kino? okey ... I'll apt-get it
[06:11] <craigbass1976> raj, so get that windows information.  If the ip of the windows box is 192.168.0.1, and the shar name is Documents, then the command will be sudo mount -t smbfs //192.168.0.1/Documents /mnt
[06:11] <ice-11> hey, i'm using beryl... what key is the "super" key?
[06:11] <raj> craighbass1976 i want it by using samba also there is any easy way
[06:11] <rbil> raj: Click Places ... Connect to Server ... Service Type: chose Windows Share, Server: hostname of Windoze box, Click Connect and find the share you wish to connect to.
[06:11] <strav> ice-11, just press the "any key" ;)
[06:12] <diocles> edbe: If /dev/video isn't appearing for one app, it won't appear for any, because it's controlled by the driver.
[06:12] <craigbass1976> raj, I don't know.  I've always just done it in the command line.
[06:12] <britt> nevermind guys, naim went into collapsed neutron star mode bc i didnt quit it, i just left it
[06:12] <Gothfunc> hi.  um..  i've been through the installation process, removed the cd, and started booting.  halfway through i'm just getting "ipw2100: eth1: Failed to start the card." over and over and over.  is it trying to connect to the net to complete the installation or something?
[06:12] <craigbass1976> raj, and I don't have any windows boxes anymore to play with; not that they played nice anyway....
[06:12] <holycow> Gothfunc, yes
[06:13] <Gothfunc> well it'll need my WEP key :S
[06:13] <strav> meh... I guess I'll soon find myself bothering the debian ppl
[06:13] <Gothfunc> but it's just a console screen with pages of that error
[06:13] <holycow> Gothfunc, i forget how to either bypass that or make sure that its not downloading updated packages during install
[06:14] <holycow> maybe someone else knows
[06:14] <edbe> what this kino is good for? DVD-making?
[06:14] <craigbass1976> raj, it's looking like System -> Administration -> Shared Folders though, but you'd have to ask someone else
[06:14] <holycow> strabes, all cool, debian rocks awsome
[06:14] <Gothfunc> surely this is a really fundamental thing, and it should just not connect to the net if there is no connection?
[06:14] <raj> craighbass1976  see i am on ubuntu linux system and i want to canect windows system what i do
[06:14] <strav> alsa main config file location, anyone? (seems asoundrc and friend are inexistant on my system)
[06:14] <J-_> I jsut recently installed phpbb on my ubuntu lamp server, and whenever i get directed to a 'https' page it doesn't display, it just says the page cannot be displayed, is https enabled when a server is installed?
[06:14] <holycow> indeed, there is no need to dl latest packages, one can do that manually later
[06:14] <malt> holycow to the bat mobile!
=== deaigo is now known as Deaigo
[06:15] <holycow> *pow* *bang* *zowie!*
[06:15] <malt> :P
[06:15] <malt> hehe yep
[06:15] <holycow> >_<
[06:15] <dagdg> Hio! kinda screwed up critical permissions on ubuntu, now I can't startup gnome. Any way to reset all permissions?
[06:15] <Gothfunc> in which case that's quite annoying
[06:15] <edbe> just testing the USB sound (it works well!)
[06:16] <holycow> Gothfunc, i think there must be a step that lets you state what you want to do, i just image base installs and forget what the install process is exactly
[06:16] <strav> how on earth can you punch a guy in order to make it sound like "zowie"?
[06:16] <reverseblade> dagdg, no
[06:16] <britt> dagdg: a buddy of mine told me the solution to all your problems is 'sudo rm -rf /'
[06:16] <britt> but he isnt my friend anymore
[06:16] <holycow> strav, magic of irc
[06:16] <Gothfunc> holycow, well this is how many people have the same problem as me: http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=%22failed+to+start+the+card%22+ubuntu&btnG=Search&meta=
[06:17] <Gothfunc> holycow, yeah good plan with the imaging
[06:17] <holycow> 2 people?
[06:17] <holycow> >_>
[06:17] <holycow> Gothfunc, thats interesting ill try an install without internet connection tommorrow to check
[06:17] <DarkMageZ> you can't ignore the small reports. for every 1 person who reports a bug. 20 others didn't
[06:18] <strav> exit
[06:18] <britt> bootcd package
[06:18] <britt> how's it work
[06:18] <Takmadeus> greetings
[06:18] <Takmadeus> may I ask how do I restart privoxy?
[06:19] <britt> reverseblade: ps aux didnt list anything, but i killed my naim process and everything is good
[06:19] <holycow> probably sudo /etc/init.d/privoxysomethingsomething restart
[06:19] <diocles> edbe: I see, my webcam doesn't work either. The driver used to be in the kernel. :/
[06:19] <holycow> thats just a guess
[06:19] <nomin> I think I found the problem with my enemy-territory file.  It looks like it attached the webpage's html at the beginning of the file.  Gwget must have done that.
[06:19] <edbe> diocles, what's your webcam?
[06:19] <Gothfunc> holycow, it seems unlikely that it would be a non-specific error with such little presence on google.  i would imagine it's tied to my hardware or something
[06:19] <J-_> is https enabled when a ubuntu lamp server is installed?
[06:19] <diocles> edbe: I don't know, but it uses the same driver.
[06:19] <edbe> what's your problem now diocles?
[06:19] <diocles> edbe: The Ubuntu way of doing it is probably to use spca5xx-source.
[06:20] <edbe> what do you mean diocles?
[06:20] <reverseblade> britt, how it didn't list anything ? ps is somewhat historical by the way ps aux --sort=gcpu | less sorts for cPU for example (ascending)
[06:20] <diocles> edbe: I'll just get it working myself. ;)
[06:20] <Takmadeus> done, thanks
[06:20] <edbe> diocles, what did you do?
[06:21] <noclue> how do i install a programme??
[06:21] <reverseblade> When my computer is idle, beagle uses 70% of my cpu, is there a fix for this ?
[06:21] <holycow> yes
[06:21] <holycow> uninstall it
[06:21] <edbe> I've never messed around with a webcam before, so I'm kind of clueless in many ways
[06:21] <holycow> beagle is just indexing your files
[06:21] <britt> reverseblade: apparently that 25% was really like 78%
[06:21] <noclue> how do i install a programme??
[06:21] <holycow> if you let it run through it will just stop eventually
[06:21] <Takmadeus> does anyone in here use tor?
[06:22] <reverseblade> holycow, I know but it never stops using cpu
[06:22] <noclue> how do i install a programme??
[06:22] <reverseblade> britt, what 25 ?
[06:22] <holycow> noclue, system / adminisytration / synaptic
[06:22] <noclue> please help
[06:22] <holycow> noclue, thats where you start
[06:22] <holycow> reverseblade, it will
[06:22] <diocles> edbe: I'm using module-assistant to install the driver. It will take me a few minutes.
[06:22] <noclue> holycow its not in synaptic list
[06:22] <reverseblade> holycow, even after 9h it is working ?
[06:22] <Takmadeus> I need help with tor+privoxy
[06:22] <deadlygorila> is there anyway to change your mac address with ubuntu?
[06:22] <holycow> noclue, whats not in synaptic?
[06:23] <holycow> that wasn't your question either
[06:23] <britt> reverseblade: nevermind. anyway that one process was using much more cpu than I noticed in top and ps
[06:23] <noclue> the file
[06:23] <holycow> what file?
[06:23] <britt> it had like 722 cpu hours
[06:23] <noclue> tsemgr-0.08
[06:23] <holycow> what is that? where didc you get it
[06:23] <holycow> and why aren't you looking for software PACKAGED FOR UBUNTU?
[06:23] <holycow> :)
[06:24] <Vigor> noclue: In terminal are a few ways, Synaptic Package Manager is easy and lists all supported programs for your Distro.
[06:24] <noclue> it's a .tar.gz file for phone software
[06:24] <holycow> noclue, remember, to install software, from a noobs perspedctie, IT HAS TO BE PACKAGED for the operating system
[06:24] <holycow> for example
[06:24] <reverseblade> holycow, how much time does beagle need to settle down on the average . I know it depends but, 1 day, 1 mo , 1 year ?
[06:24] <holycow> windows 98 is usually a separate app package from windows xp
[06:24] <noclue> *am a noob*   <<<<
[06:24] <holycow> the same goes for say redhat versus ubuntu
[06:24] <wastrel> what's beagle again?  desktop search?
[06:24] <holycow> noclue, thats no problem at all
[06:24] <holycow> wastrel, correct
[06:24] <noclue> ubuntu 6.06lts <<<<
[06:25] <holycow> reverseblade, few minutes
[06:25] <holycow> at most
[06:25] <reverseblade> noclue, if you are noob then go and read HELP on your tool bar
[06:25] <reverseblade> there is a question mark
[06:25] <noclue> reverseblade tried that it's like goble di gook
[06:25] <holycow> noclue, basically two things are required to learn linux ... or anything for that matter
[06:25] <holycow> 1. love of learning
[06:25] <mordof> hehe, there's only 1 woman out of all the guys in the wine dev team.. i find that funny
[06:25] <holycow> 2. patience to put enough work in to get the hang of it
[06:25] <reverseblade> 2. insane patience
[06:25] <holycow> :) and welcome
[06:26] <diocles> 3. Google!
[06:26] <holycow> mordof, thats actually a very high percentage
[06:26] <holycow> oh yes #3 is very important :)
[06:26] <holycow> lol
[06:26] <holycow> diocles, nice :)
[06:26] <bobbie__4> that's three things
[06:26] <diocles> Noone expects the spanish inquisition!
[06:26] <reverseblade> holycow, what happens is , when I leave my computer idle, and come back 8h later, I see beagle is using a lot of CPU. Is this normal, if not , is there fix else than removing beagle ?
[06:26] <bobbie__4> you beat me to it
[06:26] <noclue> holycow i have # 1 and am running low on #2
[06:26] <Madpilot> diocles, unless they've Googled for them :)
[06:26] <wastrel> hm.  is there a way to pull an entire text file into the X clipboard, from the command line?
[06:27] <diocles> Madpilot: Heh.
[06:27] <holycow> reverseblade, probably sec
[06:27] <Vigor> 5 make a backup, but that's any electronic data machine.
[06:27] <noclue> 6am i will have to pack in soon trying with this for last 6 hours lol
[06:27] <Takmadeus> I need help with privoxy + tor
[06:27] <Takmadeus> since I configged tor, it does not want to connect via http
[06:28] <holycow> reverseblade, okay typically in situations like this, you need to first try remove the local config files for the app so .beagle might be what you want to try first
[06:28] <holycow> then restart beagle
[06:28] <noclue> holycow what do i do to install .tar.gz file then??
[06:28] <J-_> is https enabled when a ubuntu lamp server is installed?
[06:28] <holycow> if that doesn't work remove --purge beagle out of the system and reinstall it to try it
[06:28] <Takmadeus> privoxy alone works fine, when I changed the config to use tor, firefox stopped opening websites
[06:28] <holycow> noclue, you don't, thats not a packaged file
[06:28] <reverseblade> holycow, I 've done that, and the pain is eased for say 1 week, but the issue re-occurred again. What this has to do with the config files anyway ?
[06:28] <holycow> noclue, either a tar.gz contains source code that you haveto compile THEN package to install
[06:29] <pwner> hello ubuntu community...i ws having some help trying to get twinview working...is there someone who can help me a little bit ?
[06:29] <nomin> is there a way to delete everything before a specific location in a console-based text editor?
[06:29] <noclue> holycow oh ok then there was no option to download a packaged file so i have no idea what to do now
[06:29] <holycow> noclue, or it comes with a binary executable, for which you need to make sure you have the dependencies installed before you can just double click on it and run it
[06:29] <ChrisNiemy> hi! have a question about the propietary graphics drivers which are going to be included in feisty fawn, as it seems. Will it still be legal to copy and share the feisty-CDs then? Somebody got reliable information about this?
[06:29] <holycow> noclue, another example of tar.gz is mozilla firefox
[06:29] <noclue> holcow oh no we are getting complicated again *lol*
[06:29] <holycow> you can download that from their website, extract to a folder on desktop, and just double click and run it  because it contains all the binary packages
[06:30] <holycow> noclue, *nod* one of the key mysteries of linux to windows users is that
[06:30] <holycow> windows users ASSUME all software is packaged
[06:30] <britt> holycow: agreed.
[06:30] <holycow> well it is on windows, but windows has an INSANE packaging system, shit just gets stored everywhere
[06:30] <britt> i love linux's ability to be completely customizeable
[06:30] <noclue> holycow so if i extract it to the desktop i should be able to double click it?? and xp is getting pushed out of my head slowly *lol
[06:30] <pwner> can anyone help me in setting up twinView on nvidia card in 6.10 ???? any help appreciated very much
[06:30] <holycow> on linux we have a lot of sane package manager systems,  but not many people bother to package apps, although its not hard
[06:31] <dope> what's the best linux media player
[06:31] <dope> specifically for mp3s
[06:31] <holycow> noclue, ONLY IF the programmer designed it to be run like that
[06:31] <reverseblade> dope, prolly amarok
[06:31] <holycow> firefox is designed to be run like that if you want it to
[06:31] <holycow> other apps not necessarily
[06:31] <noclue> holycow ok then lets hope they did *lol*
[06:31] <holycow> *nod*
[06:31] <holycow> :)
[06:31] <dope> so amarok is the best
[06:32] <holycow> noclue, i hope that makes sense as to WHY this stuff the way it is
[06:32] <bfarr> hello all
[06:32] <dope> i'm using gnome though
[06:32] <holycow> once you know WHY working with it become easier
[06:32] <dope> this says amarok is for KDE
[06:32] <reverseblade> true
[06:32] <J-_> is https enabled when a ubuntu lamp server is installed?
[06:32] <bur[n] er> amarok is for kde but it works fine in gnome :)
[06:32] <noclue> holycow it's not like firefox so how do i package something??
[06:32] <dope> oh
[06:32] <bur[n] er> J-_: get the apache -ssl packages
[06:32] <reverseblade> dope, you can try, totem, exile, banshee as well
[06:32] <noclue> *just getting large mug of coffee*
[06:32] <pwner> install all of the "kde" dependencies, and then you can install kde apps
[06:32] <bfarr> i have a question concerning ntfs is anyone thinks they might be able to take a crack at it
[06:32] <bur[n] er> dope: also check out "listen" or "exaile" thought they're not as mature as amarok
[06:32] <dope> i just want the best!
[06:33] <holycow> noclue, that requires a bit of learning, and finding out what dependencie the application needs first
[06:33] <holycow> noclue, i'm not sure i can point you to any usefull direction for that
[06:33] <holycow> !package
[06:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about package - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:33] <holycow> !deb
[06:33] <ubotu> deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[06:33] <bur[n] er> amarok is the best in my opinion
[06:33] <J-_> bur[n] er: which packages would they be?
[06:33] <holycow> noclue, there is a great indepth package creation tutorial on debian.org
[06:33] <holycow> which is the same here
[06:33] <holycow> but i don't know if there is a shorter easier to understand version
[06:34] <holycow> in any case what are you trying to do?
[06:34] <noclue> holycow i will have to learn this stuff because i like ubuntu alot *think it's better than xp* when things work
[06:34] <MikeyMike> ok
[06:34] <jsestri2> I can see a SMB share via going through the Nautilus connection, but I can't manage to mount an smbfs share, it just keeps saying it could not resolve...any ideas besides the tutorial in the wiki? (I am doing this through a VPN if it matters)
[06:34] <crimsun> holycow: it's called the Packaging Guide.  http://help.ubuntu.com
[06:34] <holycow> noclue, its absolutely amazing when you start to understand why
[06:34] <MikeyMike> 	libSDL-1.2.so.0 => /usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0 (0xb7f3c000)
[06:34] <MikeyMike> 	libSDL_net-1.2.so.0 => not found
[06:34] <MikeyMike> oops
[06:34] <MikeyMike> ok the second one
[06:34] <holycow> noclue, actually learning linux/debian/ubuntu will help you understand windows
[06:35] <holycow> when you go back to windows you will go 'oh now i get what those bozos are doing'
[06:35] <holycow> then you will say 'wtf are they doing it backwards'
[06:35] <holycow> :)
[06:35] <holycow> in that order
[06:35] <holycow> hehe
[06:35] <MikeyMike> what package would i have to download to get this installed (dapper)  libSDL_net-1.2.so.
[06:35] <holycow> noclue, what crimsun said
[06:35] <holycow> danke
[06:35] <bur[n] er> J-_: looks to me like it doesn't work with apache 2 :\  "apt-cache search apache ssl |grep ssl"

[06:35] <MikeyMike> reverseblade, thank you
[06:35] <MikeyMike> what about
[06:36] <Vigor> holycow: That is a truth that people are learning fast. vive le France!
[06:36] <reverseblade> MikeyMike, probably you need libSDL it self and libSDL-dev
[06:36] <crimsun> MikeyMike: libsdl-net1.2-dev
[06:36] <noclue> holycow i have been using xp since release and this appears to be diffucult but i guess that is because of the dummies guid to computing from the guys at microsoft *in the head* lol
[06:36] <jsestri2> MikeyMike: looks like it comes from the SDL library... you might try searching packages for sdl

[06:36] <MikeyMike> crimsun, ah thank you
[06:36] <holycow> noclue, its VERY VERY easy to learn linux if you have NEVER used another os
[06:36] <reverseblade> MikeyMike, apt-cache search openal
[06:36] <noclue> holycow how come i am finding this soo difficult??
[06:36] <holycow> noclue, it is quite a lot of work to learn another os if you have laready used one for 15 years
[06:36] <MikeyMike> okay
[06:36] <holycow> because of the last point
[06:37] <holycow> its weird but true
[06:37] <Vigor> Its the Unlearning that gets us , well most in trouble spots
[06:37] <jsestri2> MikeyMike: libsdl-net1.2 - network library for Simple DirectMedia Layer

[06:37] <holycow> what Vigor said
[06:37] <noclue> holycow how long did it take you to learn linux?
[06:37] <MikeyMike> ah okay
[06:37] <MikeyMike> thank you
[06:37] <reverseblade> MikeyMike, if you are trying to compile a prorgam what you need is XXX-dev packages, don't forget
[06:37] <MikeyMike> right
[06:37] <MikeyMike> i know this
[06:37] <MikeyMike> what happened is.....
[06:37] <reverseblade> MikeyMike, which game ?
[06:37] <MikeyMike> i am installing scorced 3d..... and its missing those i found by typing ldd /usr/bin/scorched3d
[06:37] <MikeyMike> and grepping the output for 'not'
[06:38] <jsestri2> bur[n] er: how would that help me?
[06:38] <noclue> holycow is there any in depth simple terms teching sites for ubuntu??
[06:38] <holycow> noclue, well yes, google is actually it really
[06:38] <edbe> diocles, what kind of 'module-assistant'?
[06:38] <holycow> its as shollow and simple as you want or as deep as you want
[06:38] <bur[n] er> jsestri2: fuse can mount samba shares... might work better than smbmount
[06:38] <Gothfunc> holycow, fixed it by going into recovery mode and setting the key etc. so it's all good
=== xFordPrefect is now known as FordPrefect
[06:38] <holycow> noclue, no one has sat down and written the handholding intermediate stages because that is really really hard
[06:39] <Vigor> There is a very nifty Wiki, and the Forums are allways good.
[06:39] <riotkittie> doesnt depth negate simplicity?
[06:39] <reverseblade> holycow, newbie question: how do I use my mouse ?
[06:39] <holycow> its hard because a) the software always changes every few months and b) every user learns differently
[06:39] <crimsun> MikeyMike: instead of ``apt-get install scorched3d''?
[06:39] <holycow> reverseblade, lol :)
[06:39] <bfarr> anyone have any idea what could cause an ntfs partition to be horribly corrupted while reading it in linux?
[06:39] <holycow> Gothfunc, your kidding?
[06:39] <diocles> edbe: It's a tool for packaging kernel modules. When it works.
[06:39] <holycow> Gothfunc, wow neat, nice work :) i'll try to remember that
[06:39] <MikeyMike> crimsun that installed version 39.
[06:39] <narg> hrm, anyone know what the adjective form of species is?
[06:39] <MikeyMike> i got version 40.1
[06:40] <noclue> holycow do you know how to integrate a second hard drive into a ubuntu system?
[06:40] <crimsun> MikeyMike: ah
[06:40] <J-_> bur[n] er: should i install all the 'ssl' packages listed for apache?
[06:40] <holycow> noclue, yes, plug it in :)
[06:40] <MikeyMike> i'll be right back
[06:40] <noclue> holycow i have one installed and i cant seem to do anything with it
[06:40] <bur[n] er> J-_: i would just get apache-ssl  (note that this is apache 1 instead of apache 2)
[06:40] <noclue> :P i already did that lol
[06:40] <holycow> noclue,  you may haveto add informatio nabout it in /etc/fstab
[06:40] <holycow> !fstab
[06:40] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions
[06:40] <jsestri2> bur[n] er: do you have any hints as to where to start using it?
[06:40] <holycow> noclue, however it should be autodetected
[06:40] <edbe> diocles, I'm now reinstalling ekiga ... hoping this time it's gonna see videodev
[06:41] <holycow> is ti formatted at all? if no use something to format to the right fs type
[06:41] <diocles> edbe: Well, either the driver works or it doesn't.
[06:41] <Vigor> noclue: a list of good info is at http://www.kernel.org/
[06:41] <noclue> thevenin isn't the best way to learn to be coached by others??
[06:41] <diocles> edbe: Reinstalling Ekiga is unlikely to help.
[06:41] <thevenin> not really no
[06:41] <holycow> i think it is, but its good for the learner not for the teacher
[06:41] <holycow> :)
[06:41] <thevenin> i get coached alot, but still gain nothing, but thats just me
[06:42] <diocles> edbe: If it's any consolation, I've studied the driver in the past, and it was badly written. ;) I wonder if it's improved...
[06:42] <holycow> thevenin, lol :)
[06:42] <noclue> holycow i figured out the format system on my own and it is partitioned with the ext2 but i don't know if this is right or not
[06:42] <thevenin> hehe :)
[06:42] <wastrel> ext2 is good
[06:42] <riotkittie> i wish i had more than 12gb of hd space :'(
[06:42] <holycow> noclue, i'm going to only point you to the fstab link above, you will haveto look up the rest your self unfortunately
[06:42] <orko> just did a dapper install and perl is complaining about locale: perl: warning: Setting locale failed perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings etc etc. anyone had this?
[06:43] <holycow> noclue, it actually very easy to be honest
[06:43] <noclue> thevenin i have had virtualy no help and i do have most of it running well
[06:43] <holycow> noclue, you need to know about fstab
[06:43] <ChrisNiemy> hi! anyone got an idea, about if feisty will include propietary binary graphic drivers... are these CDs still legal to copy and share? I'm pretty sure, they will be, just a little concerned and wondering if someone has know-how about this issue. Thanks for answers
[06:43] <edbe> diocles, Alan Cox wrote the videodev
[06:43] <J-_> bur[n] er: would i have to reinstall apache? does mysql 5.0, and php 4 (i think i have) work with apache 2?
[06:43] <holycow> you need to know sudo fdisk -l to tell you about partitions
[06:43] <holycow> and thats it
[06:43] <thevenin> well that is good
[06:43] <thevenin> learning linux does take time
[06:43] <reverseblade> ChrisNiemy, yes and yes
[06:43] <edbe> anyway, I've just reinstalled ekiga and it has a new GUI
[06:43] <grndslm> who here has recorded a desktop before?
[06:44] <holycow> ChrisNiemy, its doubtfull
[06:44] <jsestri2> anyone have any hints for mounting a smbfs share through a vpn?
[06:44] <holycow> gpl is very strict about what is allowed and what is not
[06:44] <Bill57785> anybody know what the name of the backup is for the xorg.conf file (it's hte one that handles graphical settings). I messed up something in the display settings, and now everytime I try to boot Ubuntu/Kubuntu, I get a scrambled screen (so I need to replace the file with it's backup in command line to try and fix the problem)
[06:44] <mister_roboto> noclue: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Add_a_new_hard_drive
[06:45] <jsestri2> Bill57785: it should be xorg.conf.something
[06:45] <reverseblade> ls /etc/X11/ , you should see them
[06:45] <wastrel> Bill57785:  if there is one it's probably floating around in /etc/X11/
[06:45] <bur[n] er> J-_: i honestly don't know... google or check the wiki :)
[06:45] <reverseblade> Bill57785, ls /etc/X11/ , you should see them
[06:45] <jsestri2> Bill57785: it should also be in the same folder /etc/X11
[06:45] <J-_> =\ not the answer i was looking for lol, thanks anyway dude
[06:45] <noclue> holycow i think i have the wrong partition looking at that! it's the same as the main system and states linux would i be correct in saying that?
[06:46] <Cas> grndslm: check out Istanbul, Wink, Gvidcap, Xvidcap, vnc2swf or demorecorder

[06:47] <noclue> *going to bed* lol bye evryone specialy to Holycow thanks for the help and support appreciated
[06:47] <Bill57785> ok, here goes nothing (in windows right now, restarting into linux command line....hope this works ^_^)
[06:47] <noclue> :)
[06:48] <reverseblade> ChrisNiemy, I don't but the issue is manufacturers are not against the distribution of those drivers. In deed they will be happy. The concern about this issue that, now open source community will not be able to force the manufacturers to open their source code. This is why everyone worries
[06:48] <Phuzion> Is there a way to make Gnone not ask me if I want to edit or run a script every time I run it?

[06:49] <crimsun> nice spam in -devel.
[06:49] <reverseblade> towsonu2003, I am turkish

[06:51] <Phuzion> townsonu2003:  that article really has no explanation as to why there is an investigation into Kurdish Ubuntu
[06:52] <ChrisNiemy> reverseblade ah ok, i read somewhere, that e.g. nvidia's EULA is restricting this, but it would be quite insane, if they as a manufacturer would prevent spreading their drivers. I agree that it's somehting to worry about, how this step will influence the developement of the free drivers and also the manufacturers polcies about specs and their source code. I read this: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/84  . therefore my questions. thank
[06:52] <ChrisNiemy> you, seems now a bit clearer to me.
[06:52] <quintin> jsestri2: smbmount ?
[06:52] <AnthonyG> These martian drivers give open source a bad name :(
[06:53] <AnthonyG> These martian modem drivers give open source a bad name...

[06:54] <Phuzion> Is there a way to make Gnone not ask me if I want to edit or run a script every time I run it?
[06:54] <jsestri2> quintin: I keep trying different things, theres a thing in the wiki that says to put it in fstab....i'm looking at smbmount at the moment
[06:54] <AnthonyG> The GNOME I am running does no such thing :)
[06:54] <AnthonyG> It simply runs them
[06:54] <reverseblade> ChrisNiemy, practically no. Some people undestand openness, in a different manner as if everything has to be opensourced. Open source has its advantages, but also weaknesses. Since most of the people already installed those property drivers, this will matter a little in practice. And  nvidia will enjoy the situation. This move is made  to enhance the experience of noobies  for linux.
[06:54] <Cas> AnthonyG: neh, they give those closed source/documentation vendors a bad name.
[06:55] <AnthonyG> Cas: I distribute my source better than them , Therefore these particular developers==Bad.
[06:55] <AnthonyG> I attempted to compile the modem drivers at least six times , And got two errors.

[07:04] <ChrisNiemy> reverseblade: agree, for ubuntu as a userfriendly distro this is a nice feature. and if ubuntu-ISOs are still going to be copy and shareable and one could modify them, then you're by saying that in practice this decision would not change very much. i think i got it.
[07:04] <abes> diocles: lol... im so stupid havent thought of that :P
[07:04] <abes> diocles: what would be the tar command to make it an archive?
[07:04] <asabil> abes, use lftp ?
[07:05] <jair> guys, it is anything wrong with enable "root" on my Dapper drake?
[07:05] <asabil> abes, and use mput instead of put
[07:05] <umista> how can i make all mp3 and video files play under mplayer?
[07:05] <asabil> jair, you don't need root user, I am sure of it

[07:06] <abes> diocles: is lftp built in ubuntu?
[07:06] <diocles> abes: No idea.
[07:06] <jair> asabil: the thing is that I was trying to update for first time a web page I am hosting on apache and when I log in as "user" I can not make changes or update through the ftp gui of dreamweaver.
[07:06] <diocles> abes: I appear to have it.
[07:07] <crimsun> abes: it's a reverse dependency of the desktops, yes.
[07:07] <asabil> jair, if it is a website, I am sure you will fall in love with the mirror feature of lftp
[07:07] <jair> asabil: I know I can chnage the ownership, or the permissions but I want to keep all that good even the directory were it is now "/var/www/"
[07:07] <jair> lftp?
[07:07] <asabil> yep its an ftp client

[07:26] <Vigor> Any one have the best How To Uninstall WinXP off of a HDD, this one has 3 days left till the factory installed garbage runs out.
[07:26] <cafuego_> Vigor: back up your files, delete the windows partition
[07:27] <DevC> factory installed garbage lol wouldn't that be Xp itself :)) that is why I stick with on OS per PC (XP on laptop) (ubuntu on desktop)
[07:29] <Vigor> Dont I need to unistall the HAL.DLL first? I did this a few times on other boxes, but have not tried since last SP.

[07:31] <carlos> hello
[07:31] <defrysk> darkangel_, sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer and then try again
[07:31] <carlos> Good, I have east problem when installing driver of Nvidia in Ubuntu, somebody podria to give me but except one it helps.
[07:31] <levander> In the middle of my dist-upgrade to edgy, update-manager quit because it could not install x11-common.  It looks like this was because I had the xtoolwait package installed.  But, when I try to remove the xtoolwait package, it won't let me because of unmet dependencies (probably because the dist-upgrade failed).  Anybody have an idea how I can remove xtoolwait?
[07:31] <carlos> no matching precompiled kernel interface was found on the nvidia ftp site; this means that the installer will need to compile a kernel interface for your kernel
[07:31] <darkangel_> hold on I'll do it
[07:32] <neverm1nd> hey
[07:32] <DevC> Vigor: yeah I use only freeware stuff on my XP box because they do way better than that of the commercial stuff...I got avast! and then deleted Norton (plus I have a router for safeguards) so I'm set
[07:32] <neverm1nd> how can I compile alltray on my AMD64?
[07:32] <Cas> levander: try to install those dependencies and remove it afterwards

[07:32] <woodsb02> hey guys. I am using fail2ban to stop ssh brute force attacks. I have it mail me whenever it blocks someone. the email currently has an error in it. It begins with "-en Hi,"... but the -en is meant to be an option for echo... does anyone else have this bug? Btw, I am running fail2ban in fiesty
[07:32] <optraz> i3d, thanks
[07:33] <neverm1nd> how can I compile alltray on my AMD64?
[07:33] <crimsun> levander: what about ``sudo dpkg -P xtoolwait'' ?
[07:33] <defrysk> darkangel_, what does not work ?
[07:33] <i3d> optraz: np
[07:33] <crimsun> levander: I'm guessing x11-common is blocked on things existing in /usr/X11R6/bin

[07:33] <levander> crimsun: exactly
[07:33] <Vigor> I have win2kPro on 2nd HDD, beats XP to shame, I am gonna trash the XP and do a 80g Ubuntu on it.
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:33] <levander> crimsun: I already removed /usr/X11R6/bin/xtoolwait
[07:34] <defrysk> darkangel_, do you have your repos setup properly ?
[07:34] <neverm1nd> how can I compile alltray on my AMD64?
[07:34] <darkangel_> I think so
[07:34] <DevC> I wouldn't think that you would have to do anything special for compiling it on a AMD64 as opposed to something else....
[07:34] <crimsun> levander: dpkg uses a file list, not what currently exists in the file system.
[07:34] <DevC> Vigor: yeah I have a 60 gig ubuntu on my desktop
[07:34] <levander> crimsun: But, I'm getting other errors indicating I just need to get rid of the xtoolwait package.  If I could just get apt-get to ignore the unmet dependencies, and just remove xtoolwait...
[07:34] <defrysk> darkangel_, better pastebin it anyway
[07:34] <crimsun> levander: you must remove the package by using the command I gave above
[07:34] <neverm1nd> devC: could you help me compile alltray?
[07:35] <carlos> :(
[07:35] <levander> crimsun: I thought dpkg only operated on deb files?  It will remove packages install on my system also?
[07:35] <DevC> question: how do I change my network name under ubuntu....I left the default as ubuntu and need to change it to homenet
[07:35] <noiesmo> levander, you could try sudo apt-get -f install it should then remove or try resolve
[07:35] <darkangel_> defrysk let me explain, but my english is not so gut, when I type make
[07:35] <levander> noiesmo: thanks, but tried it, didn't work
[07:35] <DevC> neverm1nd: is there any online docs that say how to compile alltray?
[07:35] <crimsun> levander: dpkg only operates on .debs, correct, but its file tracking is not live fs-based but rather on file lists
[07:35] <defrysk> darkangel_, whats your home language ?
[07:35] <i3d> DevC: /etc/hostname
[07:36] <darkangel_> the terminal tell me that a "separation" is need it
[07:36] <i3d> DevC: and command hostname
[07:36] <darkangel_> spanish but un spanish chanell nobody answer
[07:36] <Vigor> Did you read about the French today on ZDNET/Slasdot or anyplace?
[07:36] <noiesmo> sudo apt-get install --fix-missing levander
[07:36] <crimsun> levander: note /var/lib/dpkg/*.list
[07:36] <DevC> i3d: oh ok thanks
[07:36] <defrysk> darkangel_, why not install the package from ubuntu ?
[07:36] <i3d> DevC: np
[07:37] <crimsun> levander: sorry, /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list
[07:37] <darkangel_> I tried it, but I had some library problems
[07:37] <levander> crimsun: do i need to feed that directory to dpkg on the command line, or just "dpkg -r xtoolwait"?
[07:37] <darkangel_> and I found a guide
[07:37] <neverm1nd> DevC: all manuals included in alltray-0.69.tar.gz
[07:37] <crimsun> levander: sudo dpkg -P xtoolwait
[07:37] <defrysk> darkangel_, better pastebin your sources.list
[07:37] <Robokop> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34701/ this it the error i get whenever i try to run wine for the 2nd and up time since the last reboot
[07:37] <levander> crimsun: okay, i'll purge, no configs I'm worried about with that one
[07:38] <neverm1nd> but when I'm trying to compile some errors appears
[07:38] <Azmodan> I just installed Apache2 and PHP5 on Edgy but Apache won't parse php files it will just offer me to download them.  Can someone help me fix that?
[07:38] <wastrel> Azmodan:  did you follow the lamp howto?
[07:38] <defrysk> darkangel_, a guide ?
[07:38] <defrysk> like?
[07:38] <bense> what do you guys use for DVD playback
[07:38] <darkangel_> yeah do you want the adress?

[07:38] <Azmodan> wastrel: yup
[07:38] <darkangel_> but is in spanish
[07:38] <defrysk> darkangel_, did you follow any instruction ubotu gave you ?
[07:39] <Robokop> bense: vnc
[07:39] <defrysk> if not you'd better darkangel_
[07:39] <mzli> !uboto
[07:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uboto - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:39] <levander> crimsun: thanks, with that dpkg command, i've already gotten further than i was before "apt-get install -f" just finished sucessfully
[07:39] <bense> vlc eh?
[07:39] <mzli> !ubotu
[07:39] <noiesmo> Azmodan, pretty sure you may need to uncomment mod_php in apache conf and also add index.php to line with index.html in apache conf also
[07:39] <floating> how do I run linuxDC++ from command line ?
[07:39] <darkangel_> ok let me check it
[07:39] <Robokop> bense: yes
[07:40] <Azmodan> noiesmo: I'm going to check it out.
[07:40] <defrysk> !mplayer > darkangel_
[07:40] <DevC> neverm1nd:  can you paste the errors to a pastebin for me to see
[07:40] <neverm1nd> ok
[07:40] <floating> !linuxdcpp
[07:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about linuxdcpp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:40] <defrysk> darkangel_, you received a private message from ubotu
[07:40] <floating> !linuxdc++
[07:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about linuxdc++ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:40] <darkangel_> yes
[07:40] <darkangel_> i did
[07:40] <Azmodan> noiesmo: Hum...  It explains stuff, there is no mod_php to uncomment in the file.
[07:41] <defrysk> read it properly and follow instructions
[07:41] <levander> crimsun: great, i'm back to where update-manager is saying "installing the updates" now
[07:41] <i3d> Azmodan: make sure libapache2-mod-php5 installed, and php5.conf and php5.load is enabled
[07:41] <noiesmo> Azmodan, then you may need to add it i believe
[07:41] <pwner> anyone in here running twinview and can help me get mine going? id really love the help thanks
[07:41] <Vigor>  Robokop: I dont know anything about WINE or whatnot, but that post looks like a sys config error, somewhere in the install route maybe?
[07:41] <levander> crimsun: should I file a bug in launchpad?  I've already lost the exact error message the update-manager gave me before it quit originally.
[07:41] <darkangel_> but I dont know what I have to do
[07:41] <levander> pwner: you've looked at the nvidia driver README
[07:41] <defrysk> !repos | darkangel_
[07:41] <ubotu> darkangel_: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[07:42] <levander> pwner: ?
[07:42] <Azmodan> i3d: libapache2-mod-php5 is already installed according to apt-get
[07:42] <defrysk> darkangel_, read that and follow links
[07:42] <Azmodan> noiesmo: Can I add it anywhere?
[07:42] <i3d> Azmodan: check mods-enable and make sure they are there
[07:42] <floating> what is a gksudo ?
[07:42] <noiesmo> Azmodan, I 'm still running apache 1.3 but i think theirs a file in /etc/apache2/ for modules etc
[07:43] <defrysk> darkangel_, when you have the repos set up you can continue
[07:43] <crimsun> levander: I already fixed it. https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xtoolwait/+bug/51160
[07:43] <levander> floating: it's like sudo for when you need to open a GUI window
[07:43] <defrysk> darkangel_, so fix that first
[07:43] <floating> ah ok
[07:43] <i3d> noiesmo: the config is different now under apache2 under debian
[07:43] <noiesmo> Azmodan, look in filesin /etc/apahe2 they split up the old style http.conf file in to several
[07:43] <i3d> noiesmo: right
[07:43] <i3d> they are under mods-availabe
[07:43] <levander> crimsun: great, thanks ;)
[07:43] <Azmodan> noiesmo: Several directories, I see...
[07:44] <mnepton> Azmodan: did you install the MySQL module for your release of PHP
[07:44] <floating> I have a problem running my linuxdc++. I installed it as in ubuntu edgy guide, but on xubuntu, so the shortcut at applications-internet is not there, so I want to run this app from command line but I am so far unsuccesful
[07:44] <levander> crimsun: yeah, reading that bug report, i can see how that is the problem i had
[07:44] <i3d> Azmodan: you need to manually link them if they are not there
[07:44] <noiesmo> i3d, yes apache2 they split it i personnaly don' like it but its suppose to make it easier
[07:44] <i3d> noiesmo: it makes the main apache2.conf cleaner
[07:44] <noiesmo> i3d, well thats what they all say :)
[07:45] <i3d> noiesmo: vitural host configs are splited out too.
[07:45] <noiesmo> i3d, think it all is
[07:45] <Azmodan> Grrrr... Konversation crashed on me...
[07:45] <i3d> they all act as modules now
[07:45] <mnepton> Azmodan: bienvenue encore
[07:45] <treedreamer> hello,everyone
[07:45] <Azmodan> Merci
[07:45] <darkangel_> ok
[07:45] <mnepton> de rien :)
[07:45] <darkangel_> thanks
[07:46] <levander> crimsun: that bug, it says it affects "Ubuntu Dapper" which I assume is the Dapper release, and that it affects "Ubuntu".  When a specific release isn't mentioned, does that just mean the current release, Edgy?
[07:46] <Azmodan> So, I have those two directories, do I link from available to enabled?
[07:46] <darkangel_> I think I'll do it tomorrow 'cause It's late I gotta go to sleep :(
[07:46] <bense> vlc will not play this dvd
[07:46] <bense> nothing will
[07:46] <mnepton> Azmodan: did you install the MySQL module for your release of PHP?
[07:46] <bense> sheeze
[07:46] <darkangel_> thanks
[07:46] <i3d> Azmodan: yes
[07:46] <bense> i rented it from blockbuster, no scratches
[07:46] <crimsun> levander: the current _development_ branch, which is Feisty
[07:46] <LineOf7s> Is there a straightforward way (a guide somewhere, if need be) to limit a particular user's ability to run stuff to only a handful of applications, password-protecting the rest?  A 'white-list', if you will?
[07:46] <Azmodan> mnepton:  I installed version 5 (client and server)
[07:47] <neverm1nd> DevC: did you watched my pastebins?
[07:47] <mnepton> Azmodan: sudo aptitude intstall php5-mysql
[07:47] <mnepton> *install
[07:47] <mnepton> gah.
[07:47] <i3d> Azmodan: if you take a look the apache2.conf file you will see the Include directives
[07:47] <levander> crimsun: It affects dapper and feisty, but not edgy?  Seems strange.
[07:47] <mnepton> Azmodan: PHP will not talk to MySQL until that PHP module is installed.
[07:47] <crimsun> levander: the bug report just needs to be tidied.
[07:48] <floating> how to uninstall linuxdc++? the installation was pure untar of contents to /opt , also files are at /usr/share at least
[07:48] <levander> crimsun: cool, as long as it was fixed... thanks crimsun
[07:48] <Azmodan> mnepton: It already was apparently...
[07:48] <Azmodan> i3d: I see it.
[07:48] <pwner> sorry leavander, i was trying to find the readme to make sure ive gone over it
[07:48] <Vigor> Line0f7s: Yes there is, it is in the Help/Users
[07:48] <i3d> Azmodan: once you've done, reload the config and you should good to go
[07:48] <mnepton> Azmodan: ah, ok. so then proceed with ensuring things are where they need to be, and conf files set up correctly.
[07:48] <LineOf7s> ty Vigor.  I was afraid you were going to say something like that.  :o)  I'll have another look.
[07:48] <DevC> neverm1nd: what is the url for the pastebin? so I can view it
[07:50] <neverm1nd> DevC: it's said that package 'gconf-2.0' not found, but I looked in my synaptic package manager it's installed :/
[07:51] <crimsun> !info libgconf2-dev
[07:51] <LineOf7s> Vigor:  You couldn't, say, point me a lil more specifically in the right direction, could you?  'Users' seems a lil open-ended in the help I'm looking at...
[07:51] <ubotu> libgconf2-dev: GNOME configuration database system (development). In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.0-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 257 kB, installed size 1328 kB

[07:52] <malt> i installed phpmyadmin with sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin and when i got to access it by http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ it don't work wonder why?
[07:52] <levander> pwner: Did you find the README?  I'm googling for it, but can't find it.
[07:52] <Azmodan> Ok...  Files both files linked, apache reloaded, same result...  What did I miss?
[07:52] <i3d> Azmodan: hmm.. that's weird
[07:53] <DevC> neverm1nd: I'm not sure then because if you have it and the compilation is pointing to it then ideally it should compile with no problem
[07:53] <LineOf7s> Vigor.  Hrmm, okay.  Thanks.  I'm familiar with the System -> Administration -> Users & Groups section, but I'm clearly missing something.  I'll keep looking.
[07:53] <pwner> me neither :p...checking out the wiki for lates howto nvidia drivers...make sure everything is right because imho it should
[07:53] <Azmodan> i3d: What should I check next?
[07:53] <i3d> Azmodan: you linked php5.conf and php5.load both?
[07:53] <Azmodan> yes, both
[07:54] <Vigor> Let me find it again,,,
[07:54] <Azmodan> My currently linked files are : "cgi.load  php5.conf  php5.load  userdir.conf  userdir.load"
[07:54] <oldsony> why not pack mplayer into ubuntu?
[07:54] <DevC> I know a pwner but he spends his time glitching on MGO so you aren't him
[07:54] <DevC> or I should say finding glitches
[07:55] <mnepton> oldsony: licensing
[07:55] <noiesmo> Azmodan, check this it's debian but hey thats what ubuntu's built on http://www.debuntu.org/2006/06/15/66-how-to-enable-apache-modules-under-debian-based-system
[07:55] <oldsony> got it, thanks
[07:55] <i3d> Azmodan: check the log then
[07:55] <LineOf7s> Vigor:  I know I could change the permissions of every file/folder I don't want them to touch - but I was hoping there was a 'group' already set up that had no permissions already (I guess).  Then I can just add the one or two apps I need.
[07:55] <oldsony> will do it myself
[07:55] <Azmodan> i3d: Where is the log?
[07:55] <i3d> Azmodan: cause that's all you need to do. there might have something else missing
[07:56] <i3d> Azmodan: /var/log/apache2
[07:56] <oldsony> is ubuntu hire anybody?
[07:56] <DevC> anyways....malt: depends on where sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin put the installation and whether it put it into your servers main folder from which you are loading your pages from
[07:56] <w00d> yawn
[07:56] <malt> DevC: my phpmyadmin is default
[07:56] <malt> where does it load default?
[07:57] <Vigor> Yes, log on as an Admin/SUDO then select System>Administration>Groups, from there you can allow,deny access of anything in Graphical Mode. Its an old win trick that I have used forever, NEVER log on as su or admin unless working on or backing up the system.

[07:57] <levander> pwner: my system is starting to act up because I'm doing a dist-upgrade.  So, I've got to shut everything down.  Go to nvidia.com, and act like you are going to download the driver for Linux.  Have to choose Graphics Card -> Geforce and TNT -> Linux IA32 from some wizard.  That next page has a link to the README.  Last guy I told to read that, he said he was going to file a bug in launchpad that the README isn't installed on the
[07:57] <levander>  local system when you install it from an Ubuntu package.  Don't know if he did or not.
[07:57] <Azmodan> i3d: No other errors than not being able to figure the server name.
[07:58] <hentai_jeff> mmmh wade boggs goes down smooth
[07:58] <neverm1nd> DevC: I just made alltray to work ;)
[07:58] <pwner> thanks levander
[07:58] <LineOf7s> Vigor:  Okay, I'm there.  I see the tab that says "Allow user to..." and I've got all of those deselected.  But I want to limit them further.  What part of this section deals with that?
[07:58] <neverm1nd> great feeling :D
[07:58] <i3d> Azmodan: you can try tail -f the access.log and error.log and then click the php file and see if there is anything generated
[07:59] <keeganX> Does anyone know where I could find a guide on setting up gmpc and mpd?
[07:59] <DevC> apache2 only loads out of the specified directory in httpd.conf so the phpmyadmin has to be there in order for it to load with http://localhost/phpmyadmin....for example on my XP Apache loads my out of C:\www so I would have to put the phpmyadmin in C:\www
[07:59] <DevC> neverm1nd: yeah, I love that feeling especially when I finally find out why a game I'm programming suddenly won't compile :)
[08:00] <Azmodan> i3d: It just started to parse it...  Without even a restart since I last restarted it.  Weird...
[08:00] <Vigor> Line0f7s: That would be in the Terminal/Konsole, if averything is unmarked there, /usr/home is almost unusable in and of itself.
[08:00] <MBohrer14> is there a wireless card support page that I'm just not finding on the forums.  My laptop uses Intel Centrino Duo and isn't working, but does work for my linksys desktop.  is intel centrino supported?
[08:00] <Azmodan> Thanks everybody.
[08:01] <i3d> Azmodan: huh ok.. :)
[08:01] <neverm1nd> DevC: I understand you very well :)
[08:01] <Azmodan> i3d: No wait, it parses infophp.php but won't load phpmyadmin (it offers to download it).
[08:02] <DevC> although with linux I think that you can make a link to phpmyadmin in the specified apache default directory and it should clear having to move files around
[08:02] <LineOf7s> ty Vigor.  :o)
[08:02] <i3d> Azmodan: that's probably some different stories
[08:02] <Vigor> :)
[08:03] <Azmodan> ie3: I'll try to figure it out later anyway, it's getting late.
[08:03] <Azmodan> Thanks.  Good night.
[08:03] <i3d> Azmodan: as long as apache parses php files, the func should be setup correctly.

[08:09] <siXy> wildchild, just as well #ubuntu is pretty much op-free or that would be a perma-ban
[08:09] <crimsun> pants off!
[08:10] <michaelfavia> which driver should i be using for a quadro4 900? nv or nvidia?
[08:10] <DevC> off to bed later
[08:10] <crimsun> michaelfavia: latter
[08:11] <michaelfavia> crimsun, i just tried to download and run the new nvidia installer and it said that my card wasnt supported... :(
[08:11] <siXy> michaelfavia, either will work. the first is gpl and great for 2d desktop. the second is nvidias binary blob which is much faster for 3d, but not gpl.
[08:11] <Vigor> IBM bought and owns that, if it is an archived version, like 3 years old and you still have it, kewl, but IBM owns the source code to ACDSee, at least I think they do.
[08:11] <michaelfavia> siXy, great explanation. thx...
[08:11] <siXy> no problem
[08:12] <treedreamer> Now I need a software to create Macromedia flash , does anyone give me a tip?
[08:12] <michaelfavia> is there somewhere i can grab old kernels?
[08:12] <michaelfavia> that were in ubuntu channels.
[08:12] <siXy> treedreamer, wine+flash mx

[08:13] <crimsun> michaelfavia: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/
[08:13] <siXy> why would you want an older kernel however?
[08:13] <treedreamer> siXy,how about things without wine?
[08:14] <siXy> treedreamer, i dont know of any way to greate flash annimations without using flash itself.  i suspect that adobe would take a dim view of that sort of behaviour
[08:15] <cafuego_> php can generate flash on the fly

[08:21] <i3d> cafuego_: k, i'll do a search then
[08:21] <Tater> hey all I upgraded to edgy and it totally borked my system so after numerous attepts I finally got ubuntu (kubuntu was a total failure all 400 times I tried to install it) installed but everytime I attempt to set up the open source radeon drives when I startx it hardlocks my system and I have to revert to the vesa driver to get X to work any ideas?
[08:21] <i3d> cafuego_: I know the way php manipulate swf files but not aware of a way it can create swf though
[08:21] <benjamin> tater: www.getautomatix.com
[08:22] <siXy> i3d, it can create them but unless you are _very_ familiar with swf files it will be a very steep learning curve

[08:22] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[08:23] <benjamin> nope
[08:23] <siXy> benjamin, hush.
[08:23] <Jordan_U> !rpm
[08:23] <ubotu> RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)

[08:24] <Jordan_U> Tater: That sounds exactly like me :)
[08:24] <whatever22> I installed Ubuntu, jacked it up, now I am on the live CD... where is the installed /etc/group file located? All I am finding is the live CD's /etc/group
[08:24] <Tater> I tried using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and selecting the ati driver but then my system hard locks on every boot
[08:24] <benjamin> check your dev for the raid driver name example HDa=hard disk location A SDA=sata
[08:24] <siXy> LineOf7s, sorry i missed your q. assuming you have not set others to allow then only root will be able to access that file.

[08:25] <whatever22> Jordan_U: that may be why :)thank you
[08:26] <siXy> umista, i assume yo mean your raid 0 array. what raid controller are you using?
[08:26] <Jordan_U> Tater: It is called "Edgy" for a reason, and you will get biased results from waiting in a support channel :)
[08:26] <keeganX> If someone isn't busy I was wondering if they could help me
[08:26] <LineOf7s> nm siXy -patience is a virtue.  :o)  while I was waiting, I testing my theory - works a treat!  Set the group to that of the admin, and turn of "Other" executability.  Now the pleb user has no access.  ty anyway though - it's nice to be acknowledged.  :o)
[08:26] <Vigor> Tater: Did you Ctrl-Alt-Bckspce to restart reboot after install?
[08:26] <Ayabara> benjamin, ok. suspected that :-)
[08:26] <siXy> :)
[08:27] <Tater> Jordan_U: shipping kubuntu with broken wireless assistant isn't what I would call a small problem though

[08:30] <Copan> can anyone tell me how to properly use the rmdir command, there is a permissions issues with deleting the folder in the home directory my old account was using
[08:30] <sushi_> or, set the background as a web page?
[08:30] <Vigor> Did you read the walkthrough about installing Binary Drivers? It mentions restarting Terninal but not actually re-bootstrapping.
[08:30] <siXy> Copan, do it as sudo

[08:32] <siXy> Tater first boot your system into runlevel 3, then we can diagnose the problem
[08:33] <Tater> siXy: I have no idea how to do that never had to
[08:33] <Jordan_U> sushi_: There were some scrips I saw once for beryl that would play screensavers in the background, that might be a good place to start looking.
[08:33] <Jordan_U> abes: You need the pgp key for freecontrib
[08:33] <sushi_> Jordan_u aw i dont use beryl
[08:34] <siXy> add 3 to the end of the kernel line on boot

[08:35] <Ayabara> benjamin, I'm installing vmware server, but I just got the tar.gz package instead

[08:35] <benjamin> ayabara - :S ahh me no nothing about vmware yet

[08:43] <Copan> Tater: i am using ALSA, and i don't know what PCM is?
[08:43] <whatever22> Jordan_U_: when mounting hd1 as ext3: sudo mount /dev/hd1 /mnt/mynewdrive -t ext3 umask=000 This is not working for me. It is giving me wring file system but I know its ext3 because gparted says so
[08:43] <alik> I'll try the alternate - but I am not sure it would help...
[08:43] <Jordan_U_> alik: Did you take out the "quiet" parameter to see where it was failing?
[08:44] <alik> It seems to me that it does not like the CDROM for some reason.
[08:44] <Tater> Open up your mixer and look for a switch or meter or whatever labeled PCM and turn it on, thats most likely the culprit
[08:44] <alik> No, I didn't take out 'quiet' - let me try.
[08:44] <siXy> Tater, overclocked and modified graphics cards rarely completely stable and troublefree. you can either go back to dapper or format and resintall in text mode then try loading various driver kmods and see which work and which dont.
[08:44] <Copan> Tater: PCM appears to be on, it's not muted and the bars are up full
[08:45] <Tater> siXy: Oh i have no doubt that my card isn't 100 percent stable, but the worst I've seen from it are the rare artifact when I'm pushing it to hard in a game
[08:45] <Jordan_U_> whatever22: What happens when you try without the umask=000 ?
[08:46] <Tater> Copan: hmmm not sure, what started the problem?
[08:46] <Vigor> Ima gonna read the Debian articles.

[08:59] <somian> I think there's a dialog in Synaptic to add public keys, but I am total sleepy noob
[08:59] <froggy2> thanx
[08:59] <siXy> Halpo, what are you trying to find out?
[08:59] <birdfish> Halpo: what do you mean from scrat?
[08:59] <birdfish> Halpo: you mean configuring a kernel and compiling?
[09:00] <Halpo> compiling i should say
[09:00] <Halpo> yeah
[09:00] <Copan> crimsun: is there a file that can play audio through terminal, like the startup sound, all i have is radio and it takes time to load
[09:00] <siXy> i have compiled the source. i am not linus.
[09:00] <birdfish> Sure
[09:00] <somian> abes: I think there's a dialog in Synaptic to add public keys, but I am total sleepy noob <-- that was for you
[09:00] <crimsun> Copan: aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav
[09:00] <birdfish> Halpo: Are you going through the gentoo handbook or what?
[09:00] <Halpo> birdfish: i have the version of the kernel i want to work with...but when i run make menuconfig or make xconifig it quits with errors
[09:00] <Halpo> no, this is more for learning purposes
[09:00] <birdfish> Halpo: in ubuntu?
[09:00] <sushi_> keeganX chmod 777 will give all permissions
[09:00] <froggy2> sixy : what do u mean by pastebin
[09:00] <Copan> crimsun: no audio yet
[09:00] <Halpo> but i've never compiled it before
[09:01] <sushi_> froggy2:; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[09:01] <birdfish> Halpo: are you use that you downloaded the correct kernel source and untarred correctly?
[09:01] <abes> somian: well there is a tab to add keys... but i dont know where to get it from
[09:01] <siXy> froggy2, its a place you can paste stuff for others to see without cluttering irc chans with lines of error codes. i reccomend rafb.net as its faster.
[09:01] <birdfish> Halpo: once untarred, you need to be in the correct directory before you "make menuconfig"
[09:01] <crimsun> Copan: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 3
[09:01] <somian> froggy2: A Web service (free) where you can vomit stuff so you *don't do it here*
[09:01] <Halpo> i know that....it begins to run...but then quits with errors
[09:01] <birdfish> Halpo: I'm  not sure which directory that is in Ubuntu, but I'm guessing it's something like /usr/src/linux
[09:02] <birdfish> Halpo: what are the errors?
[09:02] <Copan> crimsun: no audio that appears to be audible
[09:02] <froggy2> sixy : i've found my error on there already but it doesnt seem like anybody has a solution for it.
[09:02] <Halpo> do i need to unpack it to that directory...right now its just unpacked on my desktop
[09:02] <Copan> sounds*
[09:02] <somian> abes: right! That would be the next step. At the repository's home page it might (ought to) say s't about the keys
[09:02] <siXy> Halpo, quits with errors is the second most useless piece of information you can give someone, right after it just doesnt work
[09:02] <michaelfavia> how do you downgrade to a specific version of a deb? --force-downgrade?
[09:02] <coolnichuh> im using this one now
[09:03] <birdfish> Halpo: I don't think it has to be unpacked to that directory.  What are the errors?
[09:03] <siXy> froggy2, well until i know what your error is i am unable to comment.
[09:03] <Halpo> well there are a bunch....warnings.....and also things undeclared
[09:03] <crimsun> Copan: kill $(lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*) && sudo modprobe -r $(lsmod |grep ^snd |awk '{print $1}' |sort -r) && sudo rm -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state && sudo modprobe snd-atiixp
[09:03] <froggy2> sixy : when i start ldap then it says " slapd are unable to start"
[09:04] <siXy> froggy2, if you posted the full log of your install to one of the places mentioned then i may be able to fix your problem. i have to go in 10 mins tho so youd better be quick ;)
[09:04] <Halpo> errors that shouldnt be there right after unpacking
[09:04] <Copan> crimsun: startup is audible :p, any idea what caused the malfunction, and is it possibly going to happen again/often?
[09:04] <abes> somian: got it solved... thx anyways :]  (FYI: wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -)
[09:04] <birdfish> Halpo: have never had that problem.  Perhaps pastebin the errors or google them
[09:05] <coolnichuh> do it do it froggy
[09:05] <crimsun> Copan: please pastebin ``amixer'' now
[09:05] <Halpo> im going to try to redownload i first i guess
[09:05] <Halpo> i dont know what would have gone awry though'
[09:05] <Copan> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34713/
[09:06] <somian> outSTANDING abes :-) ! Good for you
[09:07] <somian> You've got some good shell-fu there if you weren't freaked by figuring that out, abes ;-)
[09:08] <siXy> wget and pipe are shell-fu??!!
[09:09] <RawSushi> man I want the perfect desktop for my box
[09:09] <Copan> crimsun: have a conclusion as to what caused the malfunction?
[09:09] <abes> somian: lol... i gave google-fu ;] 
[09:09] <RawSushi> I can't really figure out what to use
[09:09] <RawSushi> I want something high tech, not buggy
[09:09] <RawSushi> smooth
[09:09] <abes> RawSushi: GNOME
[09:09] <RawSushi> and most importantly
[09:09] <RawSushi> easy to get around on
[09:10] <RawSushi> for when I'm tripping on LSD
[09:10] <crimsun> Copan: yeah, your pcm/spdif was reset by some program. It needs to be set to 3 for analog output for pcm.
[09:10] <siXy> there is no perfect desktop.
[09:10] <Copan> crimsun: do you know if this could happen again?
[09:10] <RawSushi> yeah kinda figured
[09:10] <crimsun> Copan: yes.
[09:10] <hentai_jeff> yes there is siXy it's called life
[09:10] <RawSushi> is gnome better than KDE?
[09:10] <siXy> life != a desktop
[09:10] <Copan> crimsun: yes as in it will happen again I assume, and anyway to prevent it?
[09:10] <siXy> no. its different
[09:10] <abes> RawSushi: I like it better
[09:11] <RawSushi> don't get me wrong, I'm no n00b
[09:11] <RawSushi> I've used both many times
[09:11] <RawSushi> but I'm saying
[09:11] <crimsun> Copan: yes, it can happen again; no, there's no way to prevent it.
[09:11] <RawSushi> is it more customizable?
[09:11] <hentai_jeff> XFCE?
[09:11] <RawSushi> than KDE?
[09:11] <siXy> gnome has a slightly simpler interface
[09:11] <RawSushi> XFCE I always found was buggy
[09:11] <BenjaminPannell> Hello, please tell me if there is a way to stop Ubuntu from saying that my external HDD is a read only disk.
[09:11] <Copan> crimsun: thanks again :-)
[09:11] <RawSushi> well
[09:11] <RawSushi> most importantly
[09:11] <somian> You'll really be "not a n00b anymore" when you stop asking questions like that, RawSushi
[09:12] <RawSushi> I want it to run smooth
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[09:12] <abes> what's the best DVD player for Ubunut? MPlayer? Gxine?
[09:12] <birdfish> Anyone know of an app that allows an external usb thumbdrive to be used as memory?
[09:12] <iBashUsr> abes: ubuntu doesn't play DVDs :-P
[09:13] <somian> BenjaminPannell: mount the disk so it is writable.
[09:13] <iBashUsr> abes: it's copyrighted... and ubuntu doesn't believe in playing copyrighted stuff :-P
[09:13] <abes> iBashUsr: lol....
[09:13] <BenjaminPannell> How?
[09:13] <iBashUsr> abes: there is this article in the wiki that tells you how to play dvd's though
[09:13] <BenjaminPannell> I have been looking for a setting for the past 5 hours
[09:13] <iBashUsr> abes: you have to use multiverse or soemething
[09:13] <abes> iBashUsr: ok... let's make an assumption (libdvdcss2 = true && w32codecs = true)....
[09:13] <RawSushi> and everything to work properly...if I want to pop in a DVD and watch, works instantly..etc.
[09:13] <RawSushi> little things like that
[09:13] <Halpo> birdfish: so i found one problemm...."Unable to find QT installation"
[09:13] <H3g3m0n> abes: Try them both :)
[09:13] <RawSushi> I want my music easier to access
[09:13] <somian> BenjaminPannell: SYSTEM|Administration|Disks
[09:14] <RawSushi> I know I can make a shortcut to it
[09:14] <RawSushi> but
[09:14] <BenjaminPannell> Thank you!
[09:14] <birdfish> Halpo: why would you need QT to be installed?
[09:14] <Halpo> to run make xconfig i guess
[09:14] <RawSushi> I'm not really crazy about the file managers I guess
[09:14] <birdfish> Halpo: stop with the xconfig ;)  just use make menuconfig
[09:14] <Sepero> omg, there is a lot of ppl in here
[09:14] <RawSushi> I like them..very neat..but just not smooth enough
[09:15] <abes> Sepero: usually 100 more :p
[09:15] <Halpo> birdfish: these are the errors i get for menuconfig....... make[2] : *** [scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/checklist.o]  Error 1
[09:15] <Halpo> make[1] : *** [menuconfig]  Error 2
[09:15] <Sepero> What is the defualt program for burning CD/DVD's on Ubuntu? :)
[09:15] <natrix> morning ppl
[09:15] <siXy> RawSushi, ubuntu+gnome is fairly close to that, but still not there by any means
[09:15] <Halpo> thats right after unpacking the kernel too....no modifications whatsoever
[09:15] <RawSushi> brb
[09:16] <birdfish> Halpo: do you have make installed?
[09:16] <birdfish> Halpo: do you have the gcc installed?
[09:16] <Halpo> birdfish: yes
[09:16] <Sepero> ANYONE: What is the defualt program for burning CD/DVD's on Ubuntu? :)
[09:16] <natrix> can anyone tell how do I unistall an application from crossover office that does not respond? I am using ubuntu draper drake
[09:16] <Copan> Does anyone know of a program/web-site that is linux friendly so I can listen to some music?? Either radio or songs, like Yahoo music, or AOL music, or anything so I can have some tunes on this OS?
[09:16] <siXy> nn everyone
[09:16] <birdfish> Halpo: dunno then
[09:17] <somian> Copan: "Linux-friendly"?
[09:17] <Copan> somian: every plugin that the site requires to listen to music is windows media or real player
[09:17] <abes> Sepero: well... CD can be played by Totem... when it comes to DVDs you first need to get codecs... then probably VLC or Mplayer
[09:17] <birdfish> Halpo: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild?highlight=%28kernel%29
[09:17] <somian> There's a lot of sites out there that make their music available via mp3, I think
[09:18] <natrix> ANYONE:how do I unistall an application from crossover office that does not respond? I am using ubuntu draper drake
[09:18] <somian> "dapper drake"
[09:18] <Kanwal--f> anybody have yahoochat working properly in linux?  Big reward
[09:18] <Copan> somian: DURR... i forgot about my cd's =p
[09:18] <natrix> somian: sorry abt the spell!
[09:18] <somian> Copan: heh ;)
[09:19] <Tom_L> mornin'
[09:19] <Kanwal--f> anybody have yahoochat working properly in linux?  Big reward
[09:19] <Sepero> natrix: Probably use the windows uninstaller that came with the program. If it doesn't have one, then I guess you just gotta delete it.
[09:19] <Tom_L> any netboot gurus here
[09:19] <Copan> somian: it cannot read the cd because: Sound Juicer could not access the CD-ROM device '/dev/hdc' Reason: Permission denied
[09:19] <natrix> sepero: if I delete it, is it stay on the bar of applications programs?
[09:20] <Copan> nothing on this laptop works with ubuntu :-S
[09:20] <Tom_L> anyone successfully got ubuntu onto a Portege p2000 (without removable media)?
[09:20] <somian> What is the dang kbd shortcut for switching workspaces in gnome??
[09:20] <tomyeah> hey guys, i deleted a gnome panel and now im trying to find this region for active tasks or task symbols of the active programs ... like gaim and amarok and so .... is there a way to get it back to a panel ?
[09:20] <abes> Copan: change permissions to 777 on /dev/hdc (make sure /dev/hdc is indeed the cd-rom)
[09:20] <Sepero> natrix: I don't know. I've never used crossover. You installed the program with a MSwindows installer, right?
[09:21] <Copan> abes: i'm terminal stupid, how?
[09:21] <somian> Copan: like abes says, it's just a perms problem
[09:21] <Sepero> natrix: (an exe program)
[09:21] <Kanwal--f> anybody have yahoochat working properly in linux?  Big reward
[09:21] <abes> Copan: fist do "sudo cd /dev/hdc"
[09:21] <natrix> Sepero: Yes, but when I am trying to use the unistall option of the program it crashes
[09:22] <abes> Copan: then "sudo ls" and check if it contains the files that should be on the cd
[09:22] <Copan> abes: cd command doesn't exist?
[09:22] <abes> Copan: hmmm
[09:22] <natrix> sepero: I also tried the same procedure from crossover but it gives me the same ...
[09:23] <Sepero> natrix: If it won't uninstall with it's uninstaller, then your only other option is deleting it.
[09:23] <abes> Copan: are you in the terminal?
[09:23] <Copan> abes: yes
[09:23] <somian> If your "cd" command does not work, your system is really hosed ;-)
[09:23] <abes> Copan: try just "cd /dev/hdc"
[09:23] <Sepero> natrix: Basically, you'd have to do the same thing if you were actually running MSwindows
[09:23] <Copan> abes: cd: /dev/hdc/: Not a directory
[09:24] <abes> Copan: or even "man cd" so you can see if it shows a man page for cd - if it shows u options its not that bad
[09:24] <natrix> sepero: I suppose I can delete it but I don't know if it has created any depedencies in the system, and if it remains as a dead link on the bar
[09:24] <froggy2> hey im having trouble with installing zimbra i pasted the setup error on these sites can anyone help plzzzz(http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/QVbBY893.html)   (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34714/) (http://pastebin.com/)
[09:24] <abes> Copan: ok... then it's good.. cd existst :] 
[09:24] <abes> Copan: try "chmod 777 /dev/hdc"
[09:24] <abes> Copan: and then try the Sound Juicer again
[09:24] <Sepero> natrix: I'm certain it has no dependancies in your Ubuntu system. What bar do you refer to? The Gnome bar?
[09:25] <natrix> sepero: I tried to find the application from the add/remove application from the Applications bar but I couldn't find it
[09:25] <Copan> abes: working correctly
[09:25] <abes> Copan: so its solved? :P
[09:25] <Copan> abes: indeed
[09:25] <natrix> sepero: yes gnome
[09:26] <Sepero> natrix: You can also be able to delete it from your bar manually, but I don't use Gnome, so I'm not sure how.
[09:26] <Sepero> natrix: You can also  delete it from your bar manually, but I don't use Gnome, so I'm not sure how.
[09:27] <abes> I installed (thru apt-get) libdvdcss2 and w32codecs after adding http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf/ to my repositories but Totem still returns the error asking if I am trying to play an encoded DVD without libdvdcss... any ides?
[09:27] <misc--> does dovecot-imapd package have mysql support?
[09:27] <natrix> sepero: I'll try it anyway as the last option, I just asked if there is a proper way to do this
[09:27] <foo> I need some way to set up a linux vpn server.. something nice, easy, and secure. Any recommendations? openvpn? Hm

[09:30] <RawSushi> maybe make a nice launcher
[09:33] <RawSushi> I guess gnome DOES run a lot smoother than KDE does.
[09:33] <RawSushi> What does everyone think of my screenshot?
[09:34] <seijling> heya
[09:35] <seijling> anyone mind helping a bit of a noob out?

[09:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 3d - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:50] <abes> niksavel: try checking that though...
[09:50] <jedix> this is funny
[09:50] <niksavel> abes: I will, but I seriously doubt it...  windows (dual boot) work okay
[09:50] <abes> Does anyone have an idea of why wouldnt DVDs play although I have the latest libdvdcss2 and w32codecs?
[09:50] <jax31> cpk1: It seems as your cd/dvd is hdc instead of hdd. Try using /dec/hdc and report back if that helped.
[09:51] <biki> huh
[09:51] <biki> :(
[09:51] <cpk1> it doesnt =\
[09:51] <abes> niksavel: that's different then...

[09:52] <dreamer> can anyboy tell me how I can see what actually happened to my desktop? what log-files are most important to check ?
[09:52] <dreamer> I can still SSH to it, but X and the KB don't respond
[09:52] <fyrestrtr> dreamer: /var/log/Xorg.0.log /var/log/message and ~/.xsession-errors (the last one is least important)
[09:52] <niksavel> abes: the situation forces me to boot to windows when I want to watch a movie...  I seriously don't like that
[09:52] <dreamer> ok, thnx
[09:52] <dreamer> reset for now So I can work on the pc again

[09:53] <fyrestrtr> BenjaminPannell: what filesystem is on it?
[09:53] <jax31> cpk1: you are member of the cdrom group? "cat /etc/group |  grep cdrom should" contain your username.
[09:53] <BenjaminPannell> ntfs
[09:53] <fyrestrtr> jax31: easier to just type 'groups' :)
[09:54] <fyrestrtr> BenjaminPannell: you need to install the ntfs-3g driver.

[09:55] <fyrestrtr> mcscruff: are you trying to run an asp application?
[09:55] <mcscruff> yes
[09:55] <fyrestrtr> mcscruff: there is chillisoft asp, but I don't think its free.
[09:55] <fyrestrtr> mcscruff: you can always run xp pro in a vm and run iis on there.
[09:55] <mcscruff> fyrestrtr, ok, cheers i'll have a look
[09:55] <jax31> mcscruff: wmplayer
[09:56] <fyrestrtr> kalemika: sounds like a problem with your hard disk?
[09:56] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: It's not.
[09:56] <enyc> I / friend are obsserving what appoars to be a problem with edgy - the 'desktop sharing' (built-in vnc verver) -- when this is switched on via system>preferences>remote_desktop -- this works, but wen than machine is then REBOOTED, and auto-login, the vnc server does _NOT_ work (gives 'authentication failed' when using a password), and will not work untils the password in re-entered in the system>preferences>remote_desktop window -- has anybody seen this -- as 
[09:56] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: I can do EVERYTHING fine booting into the repair mode.
[09:56] <fyrestrtr> kalemika: is it check the filesystem?
[09:57] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: Yeah, it's right after that before it would mount the disk.
[09:57] <tomyeah> is anyone using dmraid with nvidia (nvraid) software raid 0 ?
[09:57] <fyrestrtr> kalemika: then let it be, its just doing a filesystem check.
[09:57] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: I believe it started when I disabled ACPI
[09:57] <fyrestrtr> kalemika: is it giving you the 'filesystem has been mounted more than 30 times, doing a file system check' message?
[09:58] <kalemika> fyrstrtr: No. All activity stops and I'm just staring at text. I can move the typing cursor around and type, too.
[09:58] <niksavel> abes: thanks...  I have the same setup as the folks in that thread...  it would seem it's an XGL/compiz/fglrx problem
[09:58] <niksavel> abes: it would really seem to be a much better idea to run linux with an nvidia card
[09:58] <fyrestrtr> kalemika: what is the last message?
[09:59] <abes> niksavel: try the steps suggested there and get back if it worked... (and yeah nvidia seems to be more "userfriendly")
[09:59] <jax31> cpk1: Did you correct /etc/fstab? Which errmsg do you get now.
[09:59] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: It's something along the lines of checking filesystem or verifying filesystem followed by an [OK] 
[10:00] <abes> Anyone can help with the DVD playback? I installed libdvdcss2, w32codecs and a whole bunch of players (Totem-xine, VLC, MPlayer, Ogle) and nothing plays it - some of them return an error, the other just quit... THANKS!

[10:01] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: This may seem a really dumb question, but if I download a like, patch object for my kernel, do I need to recompile it?
[10:01] <enyc> jax31: hrrm that is used whon starting xvnc manually ?
[10:01] <dreamer> where can I upload textfiles to a pastebin ?
[10:01] <dreamer> this takes waay too long to copy/paste :/
[10:01] <kalemika> fyrestrtr: Are you leaving?
[10:02] <enyc> jax31: but what about when using the system>preferences>remote_desktop ??
[10:02] <abes> !pastebin | dreamer
[10:02] <ubotu> dreamer: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:03] <cpk1> jax31: no, but i think i know why it might have changed, the cdrom used to be plugged into the slave socket of my cable and i switched it right before i went to vacation
[10:03] <jax31> enyc: I used vncpasswd on some workstations and I can connect fine after a  (remote) reboot.
[10:03] <dreamer> abes: the problem is I can't upload there, I have to copy/paste manually, which is a major drag :/
[10:03] <abes> dreamer: are you trying to upload multiple files at once?
[10:04] <dreamer> abes: no, I want to paste my /var/log/Xorg.0.log but it's kind of long
[10:04] <jax31> cpk1: So it works now after you have edited /etc/fstab ?
[10:04] <CybersouL> how do you enable ssh
[10:05] <noiesmo> sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start CybersouL
[10:05] <CybersouL> thanks
[10:05] <abes> dreamer: makes sense... hmm... how about copying it as .txt and just uploading it to some FTP?
[10:05] <dreamer> hmm
[10:06] <dreamer> how can I copy it as a txt then ?
[10:07] <abes> dreamer: cp /var/log/Xorg.0.log /var/log/Xorg_log.txt
[10:07] <dreamer> ahh thnx
[10:08] <abes> dreamer: then u can just use http://freefileupload.net/ and it will generate a link with ur file automatically
[10:08] <abes> dreamer: so u can give a link to somebody so they can check it out (links are quite loooong so use www.tinyurl.com to make them short)
[10:09] <dreamer> abes: I can host it on my server too
[10:10] <dreamer> that was a good idea :)
[10:10] <budluva> how do i change which application opens my .torrent files? right now its set to btdownload and i just install qtorrent
[10:10] <abes> dreamer: so then problem solved... :P
[10:10] <budluva> but its automatically opening with btdownload
[10:11] <abes> dreamer: and changing it to .txt is just so it displays it instead of tryin to download - you can copy it to .html instead of .txt too so you are 100% on a safe side :] 
[10:11] <dreamer> http://pimpbak.zapto.org/~dreamer/dingen/Xorg_log.txt
[10:11] <dreamer> no it works :)
[10:11] <jax31> Cybersoul: server or client? sudo apt-get install openssh-server enable the server by default.  For better security move the port to another number. Remember to specify this new port in the client.
[10:11] <abes> dreamer: so you're good :] 
[10:11] <dreamer> I'll do /var/log/messages too
[10:12] <RawSushi> http://webpages.charter.net/bobad/gnomescreenshot.png  anyone like this screenshot?
[10:12] <abes> dreamer: well... in generall... whatever u need to share just upload it to public_html change the perms to 755 and ur good
[10:12] <abes> RawSushi: Yes, it's a very pretty screenshot... ;] 
[10:12] <RawSushi> thanks
[10:12] <abes> RawSushi: I like it ;] 
[10:12] <RawSushi> I just weant to add something to it
[10:13] <RawSushi> make it easier to get around on
[10:13] <abes> RawSushi: but the orientation "windozed" already ;P
[10:13] <RawSushi> like give it a nice launcher
[10:13] <RawSushi> man I was afraid someone would say that
[10:13] <RawSushi> I want it less like windows
[10:13] <dreamer> abes: change the perms ?
[10:13] <abes> RawSushi: so leave it as default... bar at the top... bar at the bottom... and ur set ;] 
[10:14] <A[D] minS> how i can mount file.nrg
[10:14] <RawSushi> I want it high tech looking
[10:14] <abes> dreamer: well yes... because sometimes files have permissions to be viewed just by the root (some log files for example), so you want to make sure that others can view them... that's why you change it to (rwxr-xr-x)
[10:15] <abes> RawSushi: Hmm... it looks high tech ;]  But what u need XaoS there for? does it make it more high tech? :P
[10:15] <A[D] minS> !nrg
[10:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nrg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:15] <RawSushi> nah I just wanted to put it there for the screenshot
[10:15] <abes> A[D] minS: you may need to convert it to ISO
[10:15] <RawSushi> I was playing around with it earlier
[10:16] <A[D] minS> abes: how i can convert nrg to iso  :(
[10:16] <RawSushi> I guess you're right.  looks high tech enough
[10:16] <dreamer> abes: but when the txt's are in ~/public_html/ that doesn't really matter does it ?
[10:16] <jax31> A[D] minS: apt-get install nrg2iso
[10:16] <mnepton> A[D] minS: i'll tell you, but you have to promise never to use Nero again. ;)
[10:16] <RawSushi> I just want everything to work
[10:17] <RawSushi> what would be a nice launcher?
[10:17] <abes> dreamer: well... as long as txt's dont contain your root username and pass then not :P
[10:17] <dreamer> so, my X crashed and I got this in my log and messages: http://pimpbak.zapto.org/~dreamer/dingen/Xorg_log.txt  http://pimpbak.zapto.org/~dreamer/dingen/messages.txt
[10:17] <Shi> hi
[10:17] <A[D] minS> mnepton: i haven't nero to use it :)
[10:17] <A[D] minS> mnepton: i just got this file from ma friend

[10:19] <mnepton> A[D] minS: are you in Windows or Ubuntu?
[10:19] <dreamer> I keep deleting it from the conf but it keeps showng up :/
[10:19] <abes> A[D] minS: hmmm... so first you need to get it to ISO then u can mount it.... let me figure the conversion out
[10:19] <A[D] minS> mnepton: ubuntu
[10:19] <abes> A[D] minS: here is how to mount ISOs: http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#mountunmountisofileswithoutburning
[10:19] <A[D] minS> i already install nrg2iso and converting now
[10:19] <A[D] minS> :D
[10:19] <A[D] minS> abes: Thx for help  :D
[10:19] <abes> A[D] minS: so you are set...
[10:19] <abes> !iso | A[D] minS
[10:19] <ubotu> A[D] minS: To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[10:20] <mnepton> A[D] minS: dd if=image.nrg of=image.iso bs=2048 skip=150

[10:22] <abes> dreamer: what do you mean by crashing? drops u to the terminal?
[10:22] <mnepton> A[D] minS: the mic is muted by default in ALSA. use alsamixer from the temrinal to unmute it.
[10:22] <A[D] minS> abes: i tested my with all ways
[10:22] <A[D] minS> and no sound
[10:22] <A[D] minS> mnepton: i did
[10:22] <dreamer> abes: well, the screen freezes, I can still _move_ the mouse, nothing else
[10:23] <A[D] minS> and make it full up but nothing i can hear
[10:23] <abes> A[D] minS: defected mic?
[10:23] <mnepton> A[D] minS: do not have any sound apps open except for the app you are testing
[10:23] <A[D] minS> i have in alsamixer mic boss
[10:23] <dreamer> I can still SSH to the machine, but the KB is dead (so I can't do RSEIUB)
[10:23] <A[D] minS> there is no mic as in my PC
[10:23] <abes> A[D] minS: have u tried another mic though?
[10:23] <A[D] minS> mnepton: yes
[10:24] <A[D] minS> tried 3 mics till now
[10:24] <A[D] minS> and the point is they working under windows :D
[10:24] <Shi> abes what's exactly the pb you have with DVDs ?
[10:25] <abes> dreamer: read this (http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=426858) starting at post #9
[10:25] <dreamer> ok
[10:26] <abes> Shi: regardless of the player I use all it plays is the production company logo thing... and then either quits/stops
[10:26] <abes> Shi: only Movie Player is asking if I'm trying to "Watch an encrypted DVD without libdvdcss?"
[10:26] <abes> Shi: by movie player i mean Totem-xine
[10:26] <Shi> ok
[10:27] <Shi> you sure you have libdvdcss and stuff installed ?
[10:27] <abes> Shi: yeah... double checked.. added the required repositories then installed libdvdcss and w32codecs... run apt-get upgrade - everything up to date
[10:28] <abes> Shi: tried different discs too... no luck
[10:28] <abes> Shi: somebody suggested that it may be a region issue, but when I've had windoze on this lappy it played good... so i think it's more software/config issue

[10:36] <dreamer> abes: that's  lot of code in that post that I don't have

[10:39] <Dheeraj_k> how to install j2ee server and tomcat server in ubuntu?

[11:05] <boink> efox: is that on edgy?
[11:06] <boink> I had a real pain in getting the wireless on edgy going.
[11:06] <efox> abes: im such a nooob. I think it was the pcmia. When i popped it out, and tried iwconfig, it said no card found...when i popped it back in..it found the essid
[11:06] <efox> abes: dapper...or drapper..whatever its called
[11:06] <boink> dapper
[11:06] <efox> thanks
[11:06] <boink> hmm .. dapper is quite good with wireless
[11:06] <efox> dapper
[11:07] <efox> i originally had the broadcom (internal), but i borred my buddies dlink G630
[11:07] <boink> hmm .. I have a netgear WG511T. that really works well on open source systems
[11:07] <abes> efox: so when u have no pcmcia only eth0 is visible?
[11:08] <abes> !flash
[11:08] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[11:08] <efox> abes: if  i go to network tools, only eth0 shows up
[11:09] <Shi> efox have you tried to see what appears with ifconfig -a ?
[11:09] <abes> efox: good... therefore the onboard is disabled
[11:10] <boink> how about lspci ?
[11:10] <efox> shi: eth0, sit0 and wlan0  :S
[11:11] <abes> efox: but is the pcmcia plugged in now?
[11:11] <efox> abes: yes
[11:11] <efox> its flashing and everything
[11:11] <Ernz> Here's a stupid question, but I'm sure someone here will know the answer. I know that the new version of Ubuntu, Edgy comes with this thing AIGLX or soemthing along those lines. And there is soemthing called beryl that allows you to transmogrify your desktop into a cube and spin it round and jazz like that. How do I do this?
[11:12] <abes> efox: so try unplugging the pcmcia and run "ifconfig -a"
[11:12] <Ernz> What dubry do I type into that thingamajig to make it cubify?
[11:12] <efox> abes: wlan0 goes away, the rest remain
[11:13] <Shi> so pcmcia is recognized as wlan0
[11:13] <Shi> try and assign it an IP
[11:13] <abes> Shi: have you had a chance to look at that totem paste?
[11:13] <mnepton> Ernz: don't do it. seriously. let it go.
[11:13] <Shi> (is "assign" the right word here ?)
[11:13] <mahtavamatt> Enrz: can't remember the address but if you search google for AIGLX+EDGY+BERYL you'll get the answer
[11:13] <ubuntu> slt
[11:13] <Ernz> mnepton: Sounds like you had a bad experience?
[11:14] <abes> Anyone can tell me how to install the flash and java plugins for Firefox?
[11:14] <Shi> yes abes and I can't see why it won't work
[11:14] <mahtavamatt> mnepton: why not?
[11:14] <mnepton> Ernz: not at all, as i have never tried it.
[11:14] <Ernz> !aiglx
[11:14] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.

[11:14] <ubuntu> koi?
[11:14] <ubuntu> ki parle francais?
[11:14] <Shi> you have to download them and then install them amnually abes (for firefox)
[11:15] <kaptengu> Ernz: join #ubuntu-xgl
[11:15] <mnepton> ubuntu: nous parlons francais en #ubuntu-fr. cette canal est anglais seulement.
[11:15] <abes> Shi: ok... thanks
[11:15] <Ernz> kaptengu, Merci bucket.
[11:15] <abes> bucket? lol
[11:15] <Ernz> Oui, c'est une francais, innit.
[11:15] <mnepton> Ernz: none of the compositing solutions for X11 are finished. they are all works in progress, and as such are unreliable and greatly decrease system stability.
[11:16] <Ernz> mnepton, thats all I need to know.
[11:16] <efox> shi: sorry, but how do i assign it an ip
[11:16] <abes> Pourquoi pas beaucoup?
[11:17] <Ernz> beaucoup: oui, that's what I parler'd.
[11:17] <Shi> efox if you have a router or something running a DHCP server it should be automatic
[11:17] <Ernz> :)
[11:17] <Shi> if not first try dhclient wlan0
[11:17] <boitono> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/47768  bug number 47768 has yet to be resolved and I am be afflicted, and news/help would be appreciated.
[11:17] <abes> Ernz... lol... but is "bucket" a slang for "beaucoup"???
[11:18] <efox> shi: would i still be able to assign it an ip even if im already connected hardwired ?
[11:18] <valehru> hey guys...I have a Presario v3000 and Im running dapper...however the headphone jack is not working and when the headphones are plugged in sound still comes from the main speakers...any help would be appreciated.
[11:18] <Shi> yep efox
[11:18] <efox> shi: if not, ill disconnect and try it
[11:18] <efox> oh..ok
[11:18] <Ernz> Abes: Must be. :)
[11:19] <Malician> what's the default root password on a livecd?
[11:19] <boitono> And what really sucks is that the bug has been open since may of this year!
[11:19] <efox> shi:....i...i....got an ip
[11:19] <Shi> efox hurray ! \o/
[11:20] <EdLin> Malician: there is none, Ubuntu is like a Mac, it runs sudo and rootless.
[11:20] <abes> Is flashplugin the only thing u need to get off synaptic to get flash in Firefox? Did it and still no luck
[11:20] <efox> shi: i dont even know what to say...wireless and me have been going hardcore..and ...ya
[11:20] <Shi> ^^
[11:20] <efox> shi: is it possible to ping something USING the wlan0 ?
[11:20] <Shi> sure
[11:20] <efox> or would i have to disconnect eth0 ?
[11:20] <Shi> disconnect eth0 first
[11:21] <efox> ok
[11:21] <efox> brb
[11:21] <Shi> do you need a gatewayy to connect to the internet ?
[11:22] <Shi> abes go there : https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/plugins/ and dowload the plugins you need and foolowo the install indications
[11:25] <yum99> hi all, is it possible to sart a program like firefox form PC A on PC B so it runs at the remote PC B through a ssh connection? when I type "firefox" it tells me "cannot open display".
[11:25] <mnepton> yum99: why do you want to run a web browser with no GUI?
[11:26] <dreamer> anyone active with  X-skills?
[11:26] <njan> yum99, what you're referring to is called X Forwarding.
[11:26] <abes> Shi: thanks a lot!
[11:26] <dreamer> http://pimpbak.zapto.org/~dreamer/dingen/Xorg_log.txt   http://pimpbak.zapto.org/~dreamer/dingen/messages.txt
[11:26] <evad> yum99: You use ssh user@host -X
[11:26] <njan> yum99, http://www.cisl.ucar.edu/docs/ssh/guide/node29.html
[11:26] <Shi> you're welcome abes
[11:26] <evad> yum99: the server also has to support X Forwarding (or rather, have it turned on)
[11:26] <yum99> mnepton: I am sitting here with my students and we are wondering if it is possible to start a GUI Programm on the remote PC
[11:27] <boink> yumm99: sure, it's possible
[11:27] <boink> you just need loads of bandwdith
[11:27] <njan> yum99, yes, using X Forwarding.
[11:27] <boink> really ... when everyone has 100 gig bandwidth, that should be possible
[11:27] <njan> yum99, ssh -X will enable it using SSH, but it's probably worth reading something about it either on the SSH manpage or the page I linked you to (which actually isn't that good; I'll see if I can find another) first.
[11:28] <yum99> to all: Sorry I don't want to use the program local I just want to start it on the remote PC
[11:28] <mm2000> is insert ignore generic sql?
[11:28] <boink> you need to use a local programm like ssh to make a connection to the box
[11:28] <njan> yum99, ignoring the parts about setup, http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_X-forwarding <= that isn't a bad explanation of how to basically get X Forwarding working.
[11:29] <boink> yum99: ever heard of "thin" clients?
[11:29] <njan> yum99, using  X Forwarding, the GUi appears on your client, but the actual software is running on the remote PC.
[11:30] <njan> yum99, it's a little like using citrix, if you've ever used that.
[11:30] <mnepton> yum99: but why would you want to run an app with no way to communicate to it?
[11:31] <yum99> boink: I am here in school with a class. I show them what is possible. I can kill programms on the remote PC now the ask me if it is also possible to start a programm. For Example I can start firefox on the remote PC where Mark is sitting so he can use it.
[11:31] <yum99> mnepton: just wondering if it is possible
[11:31] <mnepton> yum99: it is not possible to start an X11 app on a remote machine without a virtual display to which to bind it.
[11:31] <valehru> Hey guys, is there a /etc/modprobe.conf in the ubuntu OS?
[11:31] <rc-1> Hmmm having various problems with programs not connecting to network, heres one error message: Network problems encountered during search.  White spaces needed between publicid and system id.
[11:31] <valehru> Or /etc/modprobe.conf's equivilant in Ubuntu?
[11:33] <yum99> mnepton: that is what I was wondering. And I can't tell the program to which display to connect to?
[11:33] <abes> Shi: installed both java and flash plugins and copied the files to the plugins dirs, but still nothing works... wrrrrr :S
[11:33] <mm2000> anyone knows if insert ignore is generic sql?
[11:33] <Shi> did you restart Firefox ?
[11:34] <mnepton> abes: you don;t need to install *any* of that stuff by hand. there are packages for all of it.
[11:34] <abes> Shi: yes
[11:34] <abes> mnepton: well... in installed flash via synaptic.... and no luck...
[11:34] <os390> I want to install webmin but i try to find another posibility if exist anyone can recommend one
[11:34] <yum99> thx to all for your help
[11:34] <mnepton> abes: sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[11:35] <abes> mnepton: 0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[11:35] <mnepton> abes: enable universe and multiverse
[11:36] <abes> mnepton: i have it enabled
[11:36] <mnepton> aptitude show flashplugin-nonfree
[11:36] <Shi> abes did you copy libflashplayer.so and flashplayer.xpt to ~/.mozilla/plugins ?
[11:36] <mnepton> Shi: let's not do manual stuff unless we have to?
[11:37] <abes> mnepton: 7.0.68~ubuntu2~dapper1
[11:37] <joaquin_> hi
[11:37] <joaquin_> all
[11:37] <joaquin_> i've a question about em64t architecture
[11:37] <Shi> that's the way I did it mnepton , manual
[11:37] <mnepton> abes: so it looks like it's already installed?
[11:38] <abes> mnepton: indeed
[11:38] <mnepton> Shi: that's not the way we recommend
[11:38] <joaquin_> it's supported by waht version of ubuntu?
[11:38] <abes> Shi: i didnt install flashplayer.xpt - where is it?
[11:38] <joaquin_> x68 or 64? something similar to redhat enterprise version?
[11:38] <mnepton> abes: quit all browsers, "sudo aptitude remove flashplugin-nonfree && sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree"
[11:40] <abes> mnepton: installation failed
[11:40] <mnepton> abes: reason?
[11:40] <abes> mnepton: none...
[11:40] <devilsadvocate> joaquin_, 64 bit versiond of ubuntu are available
[11:40] <abes> mnepton: ok - retried and it worked
[11:40] <mnepton> abes: do you have third party repos enabled in your sources.list?
[11:40] <abes> mnepton: i mean didnt fail
[11:40] <triana> hola
[11:40] <abes> mnepton: lets check in the browser itself
[11:41] <mnepton> abes: http://orisinal.com
[11:41] <abes> mnepton: nope
[11:41] <joaquin_> devilsadvocate, yes i know but for imb xseries server is neccessary a different version?
[11:42] <joaquin_> ibm sorry
[11:42] <abes> mnepton: same thing applies to java plugin - followed all the instructions on the SUN site - still no luck
[11:42] <justin_> is there a way to install ubuntu 6.06 on a lamp with only a base install?
[11:42] <justin_> no games etc
[11:42] <lkthomas> hey all
[11:42] <mnepton> abes: there are packages that will install Java for you. and then you have to run update-java-alternatives as root.
[11:43] <abes> hmmm
[11:43] <joaquin_> devilsadvocate, what is the difference betwen amd 64 or em64t
[11:43] <abes> mnepton: well... lets do it one step at the time... coming back to flash...
[11:43] <joaquin_> do i need a different distro betwen them?
[11:43] <crimsun> mnepton: (abes might be experiencing the debconf:noninteractive issue. The old flashplugin-nonfree will fail if noninteractive is used, since the license can't be accepted)
[11:44] <crimsun> (it can be worked around by ``dpkg-reconfigure debconf'' and using Dialog temporarily)
[11:44] <valehru> Hey guys, is there a repository for Alsa drivers?  Need to get alsa-1.0.12 installed, there is a bug on my laptop that my headphones don't work without the new driver
[11:44] <crimsun> valehru: no, but you can compile alsa-driver 1.0.13 yourself
[11:45] <valehru> need alsa-1.0.12
[11:45] <mnepton> crimsun: possible. worth a try.
[11:45] <crimsun> valehru: the grab 1.0.12 from the ftp site
[11:45] <crimsun> then, even
[11:45] <valehru> crimsun, im not even sure what version i have now though...
[11:45] <crimsun> valehru: lsb_release -r
[11:46] <abes> mnepton: so what should I do according to crimsun's suggestion?
[11:46] <valehru> crimsun, Release:        6.06
[11:46] <valehru> thats dapper, not alsa.
[11:46] <crimsun> valehru: you have 1.0.13 + incomplete patches
[11:46] <crimsun> valehru: yes, I know. I backported ALSA for both Dapper and Edgy.
[11:46] <valehru> ahh k..
[11:47] <mnepton> abes: sudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf
[11:47] <mnepton> abes: be sure to allow/enable dialogs
[11:48] <valehru> crimsun, so what would you recommend that I do....downgrade to 1.0.12?  I have to apply a hda-generic-hp-fix.diff patch to those libs....not sure if it will work to 1.0.13
[11:48] <abes> mnepton: done... choosed dialogs - no output.. command execution done
[11:48] <skimon> hello
[11:48] <crimsun> valehru: which hp-fix?
[11:49] <skimon> i want to install nvidias drivers BUT when i hit CTRL + ALT + BACKSPACE X server restarts. how can i close him to install the grafic drivers?
[11:49] <mnepton> abes: sudo dpkg-reconfigure flashplugin-nonfree
[11:49] <mnepton> abes: and if that doesn;t work, do the remove/install dance again
[11:49] <crimsun> skimon: you need to stop the display manager. Pressing ctrl+alt+backspace only kills the X server; the script that starts the server simply restarts it upon noticing.
[11:49] <bimberi> skimon: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
=== Konnektion is now known as lunchbox
[11:50] <bimberi> skimon: (assuming gdm is you display manager)
[11:50] <skimon> yes
[11:50] <mnepton> bimberi: bonus points for using invoke-rc.d ;)
[11:50] <bimberi> *your
[11:50] <skimon> i use gdm and X11
[11:50] <bimberi> mnepton: the one true way baby :)
[11:51] <abes> mnepton: failed and failed...
[11:51] <crimsun> abes: did you purge it (removing is insufficient)/
[11:51] <mnepton> abes: could you pastebin the failure messages?
[11:51] <valehru> crimsun, https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=2412
[11:52] <mnepton> crimsun++, i need a smoke. :)
[11:52] <valehru> crimsun, it seems to effect every v3000 presario owner in Dapper.
[11:52] <abes> mnepton: no failure messages... just "installation failed"
[11:52] <abes> crimsun: anymore specific?
[11:52] <valehru> crimsun, the fix is in that file..
[11:52] <rausb0> bimberi: what would be wrong about /etc/init.d/gdm stop?
[11:52] <crimsun> abes: sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-nonfree
[11:53] <abes> crimsun: dpkg - warning: while removing flashplugin-nonfree, directory `/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins' not empty so not removed.
[11:53] <abes> crimsun: same thing about few more dirs
[11:53] <crimsun> abes: that's fine.
[11:54] <abes> crimsun: ok so purging done - try reinstalling?
[11:54] <crimsun> abes: now, sudo apt-get --reinstall install flashplugin-nonfree
[11:54] <tamois> how can i set up an automountcd so that when i insert a cd it places an icon on my desktop?
[11:54] <abes> crimsun: installation failed
[11:55] <BenjaminPannell> sorry to keep bothering about this but I have tried everything to get my external HDD(NTFS) to become readable & writeable but nothing has worked.
[11:55] <apokryphos> abes: try without the --reinstall option
[11:56] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: usb? What happens when you plug it up? Nothing?
[11:56] <abes> apokryphos / crimsun: after trying without the --reinstall: flashplugin-nonfree is already the newest version.
[11:56] <crimsun> abes: dpkg -D3773 -i /var/cache/apt/archives/flashplugin-nonfree_7.0.68*deb
[11:56] <crimsun> abes: pastebin all of it (it's long)
[11:57] <BenjaminPannell> yes USB, when I plug it in to my USB 2.0 port it displays on the desktop but I am unable to read/write onto it
[11:57] <crimsun> valehru: sec
[11:57] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: ok, fire up a terminal and give me the output of cat /etc/mtab
[11:57] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: pastebin it for me, that is.
[11:58] <abes> crimsun: it cuts it at some point on the top... cant copy the whole thing... should I do |more?
[11:58] <valehru> crimsun, I seem to only have 1.0.10-4ubuntu alsa-base installed....hmmm.
[11:58] <abes> crimsun: also at the end it showed me "installation failed"
[11:58] <crimsun> valehru: that's not related.
[11:58] <bimberi> rausb0: i'm trying to find the reference, but can't.  As I recall it, it's what package maintainers are told to use in their package scripts. It's probably ok for users to use /etc/init.d/... but it's a good habit/practice to use invoke-rc.d.
[11:59] <crimsun> valehru: the driver version is listed in /proc/asound/version, but I didn't change the version string
[11:59] <crimsun> abes: I need as much of it pastebinned as possible
[12:00] <valehru> crimsun, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.10rc3 (Mon Nov 07 13:30:21 2005 UTC).
[12:00] <rausb0> bimberi: i am just reading the manpage :)
[12:00] <valehru> crimsun, I think alsa-driver-1.0.13 has that patch applied already.
[12:00] <crimsun> valehru: you don't have to tell me, I know. I spent a year working on it.:)
[12:00] <valehru> crimsun, should I just compile it and try it out and see if it resolves the problem?
[12:00] <abes> crimsun: check if this is enough: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34732/ then tell me if u need more. (Thanks a lot for help!!!!)
[12:01] <valehru> crimsun, soz, just trying to get these headphones working.
[12:01] <valehru> :)
[12:01] <apokryphos> grr, that pastebin is annoying
[12:01] <crimsun> valehru: you actually need hg alsa-driver
[12:01] <bimberi> rausb0: D'Oh! That's where I saw it :)
=== lunchbox is now known as Konnektion
[12:03] <valehru> where would that be located?  its not in the repo's so Im assuming alsa's Homepage?

[12:08] <bimberi> ActivE: icecast2
[12:08] <ActivE> hehe bimberi my hero :)
[12:09] <BenjaminPannell> it just gives ">"
[12:09] <bimberi> lol
[12:09] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: does your HD there definitely contain data?
[12:09] <BenjaminPannell> Yes, I use it on windows without problems
[12:10] <crimsun> abes: and with ``sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh flashplugin-nonfree'' ?
[12:10] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: though it's mounted rw for some reason, that's strange. You can't write to NTFS in Linux
[12:11] <abes> crimsun: failed
[12:11] <BenjaminPannell> so then how can I preserve my data and allow it to write
[12:12] <Hellevator> how do I put different wallpapers on each workspace?
[12:12] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: you won't be able to write to it. Only read, as it's NTFS.
[12:12] <apokryphos> thank Microsoft for that
[12:13] <mattl> anyone know how to install a font in GNOME?
[12:13] <apokryphos> !font
[12:13] <ubotu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer
[12:13] <crimsun> abes: dpkg-reconfigure -fdialog flashplugin-nonfree
[12:13] <abes> crimsun: i dont know if thats relevant but in both plugin files (mozilla and mozilla-firefox) there is libflashplayer.so
[12:13] <BenjaminPannell> is it possible to change the type of drive without losing my data
[12:13] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: try something like this: sudo umount /media/Ben* && sudo mkdir /media/ntfs && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/ntfs -t ntfs -o umask=0222
[12:14] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: nope. Because changing it involves formatting it.
[12:14] <crimsun> abes: did you install them manually?
[12:14] <sn00p> how come i'm getting no ident when I connect to irc  using xchat do I have to configure something with in xchat?
[12:14] <abes> crimsun: yes, i have moved them there earlier
[12:15] <crimsun> abes: hmm, you need to remove them first
[12:16] <crimsun> abes: ok, remove the files you manually installed, purge flashplugin-nonfree, then reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
[12:16] <efox> shi: works great !
[12:16] <BenjaminPannell> It says "sudo: unmount: command not found"
[12:16] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: please just copy+paste the above
[12:16] <efox> my kernel is 2.6.15.25.386, there are newer kenerals...should i get it ?
[12:17] <efox> linux-image..thats what the update window says
[12:17] <abes> crimsun: well it cant reinstall since its not installed... should i run install instead of reinstall?
[12:17] <crimsun> abes: yes
[12:17] <abes> ok
[12:17] <abes> crimsun: done... lets check in the browser now
[12:17] <BenjaminPannell> okay
[12:18] <BenjaminPannell> now what?
[12:18] <abes> crimsun: damn... still not working
[12:18] <efox> is there a big different ?
[12:18] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: now go over to /media/ntfs -- can you see your files?
[12:18] <crimsun> abes: what exists in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/ ?
[12:19] <BenjaminPannell> yes
[12:19] <apokryphos> there you go, then.
[12:19] <abes> crimsun: flashplayer.xpt, libflashplayer.so, libjavaplugin_oji.so, libunixprintplugin.so
[12:19] <crimsun> abes: are the symlinks for flashplayer.xpt and libflashplayer.so valid?
[12:19] <BenjaminPannell> they are still read only unfortunately
[12:19] <crimsun> abes: they should point to files in /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/
[12:20] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: they will *always* be thus. Journalling a closed-source filesystem is insanely hard to get right
[12:20] <apokryphos> ....such as ntfs
[12:20] <abes> crimsun: they are valid
[12:20] <crimsun> abes: and is 7.0.68 registered in firefox's about:plugins ?
[12:20] <apokryphos> BenjaminPannell: hence there's no read-write support for ntfs on Linux. Blame MS.
[12:21] <sn00p> how come i'm getting no ident when I connect to irc  using xchat do I have to configure something with in xchat?
[12:21] <BenjaminPannell> I blame them for a lot of things
[12:21] <abes> crimsun: how about copying stuff from /usr/lib/firefox/plugins to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins ?
[12:21] <crimsun> abes: don't; the latter is symlinked
[12:21] <efox> if i change my kernel, does that mean all hardware thats been configured changes as well ?
[12:21] <abes> crimsun: about:plugins lists 0 plugins :S
[12:21] <crimsun> abes: please check firefox's about:plugins
[12:21] <efox> sorry for the ignorant questions
[12:22] <crimsun> abes: hmm, did you dist-upgrade?
[12:22] <abes> crimsun: yeah
[12:22] <crimsun> abes: from dapper -> edgy?
[12:22] <abes> crimsun: hmmm... i dont think so... how do you do that?
[12:23] <crimsun> abes: ``lsb_release -r'' tells you which release you're running
[12:23] <abes> crimsun: just apt-get dist-upgrade?
[12:23] <abes> crimsun: 6.06
[12:23] <crimsun> ah, you're still running dapper
[12:23] <crimsun> right, you're using the backported version
[12:24] <crimsun> abes: can you check that /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox is a symlink to /usr/lib/firefox ?
[12:25] <abes> crimsun: well yeah... its linked to /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/ so its ok
[12:25] <crimsun> abes: no, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox itself should be symlinked to /usr/lib/firefox
[12:25] <crimsun> abes: readlink /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox
[12:29] <abes> crimsun: it is... sorry
[12:29] <knix_> Anyone using seveas' w32codecs package?
=== knix_ is now known as knix
[12:29] <crimsun> abes: so the above command returns "firefox"?
[12:29] <abes> crimsun: yes it does
[12:30] <thor> I have downloaded the edgy iso's I need, and want to verify them. Can someone point me to the md5 checksums for the iso's?
[12:30] <BenjaminPannell> how do I undo this?
[12:30] <abes> !iso | thor
[12:30] <ubotu> thor: To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[12:32] <thor> abes: yup...that's how to do it, but I have been searching for the checksums themselves and can't find them
[12:32] <abes> thor: oh.... hmmm... what .iso are they exactly?
[12:33] <thor> abes: the desktop and alternative iso's for edgy
[12:33] <crimsun> abes: you have a firefox issue, then, if no plugins are being registired
[12:33] <crimsun> abes: registered, rather
[12:33] <Flannel> thor: it's on the same page you downloaded them from
[12:33] <crimsun> abes: it's no longer a Flash issue, since flashplugin-nonfree is installed correctly
[12:33] <BenjaminPannell> please can someone tell me how to undo this:  sudo umount /media/Ben* && sudo mkdir /media/ntfs && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/ntfs -t ntfs -o umask=0222
[12:33] <abes> crimsun: so? reinstall firefox?
[12:33] <thor> that's what I thought...but when I go back to download them I don't see the md5's...must be on the wrong download page.
[12:33] <crimsun> abes: no. The firefox issue is beyond my scope
[12:33] <Flannel> thor: top of the listing, there's a MD5SUMS file
[12:34] <Flannel> thor: ftp://mirror.d-jacobs.com/ubuntu/edgy/  for instance (thats just an arbitrary mirror I grabbed) fourth link from the top
[12:34] <abes> crimsun: will the plugin files be removed once I remove firefox?
[12:34] <thor> Flannel...thanks. From the GetUbuntu download page I get a direct link to the iso...not an ftp page. That was what I needed.
[12:35] <Flannel> thor: yeah, they've moved it all around.  Although, I don't believe you can get the alternate without going to that page.
[12:35] <thor> Flannel: well...that will do it. Thanks
[12:35] <poolkey172> Hi guys n dolls
[12:35] <crimsun> abes: if you use aptitude or synaptic, yes
[12:36] <crimsun> abes: if you use apt-get, probably not
[12:36] <abes> crimsun: ok... its good... i want to remove all of it :P
[12:36] <abes> crimsun: reinstall browser and then see what happens...
[12:36] <BenjaminPannell> Please can someone tell me how to undo:  sudo umount /media/Ben* && sudo mkdir /media/ntfs && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/ntfs -t ntfs -o umask=0222
[12:36] <abes> crimsun: that's odd... i removed firefox using synaptic and then installed using synaptic and it installed 2.0
[12:36] <crimsun> BenjaminPannell: what do you mean by "undo"?
[12:37] <abes> crimsun: shouldnt it go to 1.5 as the one that was installed there previously?
[12:37] <BenjaminPannell> nevermind, I did it myself
[12:37] <BenjaminPannell> thank you for all of your help
[12:37] <abes> what are the benefits of going to edgy from dapper?
[12:38] <Flannel> abes: newer versions of things
[12:38] <crimsun> abes: dapper only has 1.5.0.8
[12:38] <crimsun> abes: are you _sure_ you're not using a third-party (non-Canonical) repository?
[12:38] <abes> crimsun: the only additional repository i have is the one i needed for libdvdcss and w32codecs
[12:39] <crimsun> abes: apt-cache policy firefox
[12:39] <mnepton> abes: what does "lsb_release -a" tell you?
[12:39] <Flannel> crimsun: dapper-backports has FF2.0... I can't believe they backported it, but they did.
[12:39] <abes> crimsun: that's weird: 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.8-0ubuntu0.6.06
[12:39] <abes> mnepton: im on dapper
[12:40] <mnepton> abes: humor me and try the command?
[12:40] <Flannel> crimsun: er... wait.  odd.  packages.ubuntu.com is disobeying me ;)  searching under dapper backports really searches edgy.  very odd.
[12:40] <abes> mnepton: i told you.... Description:    Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS
[12:41] <mnepton> abes: pastebin your sources.list?
[12:42] <abes> mnepton: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34737/
[12:44] <mnepton> abes: nothing looks too unusual. my guess is that the manual twiddling confused the hell out of the packaging system.
[12:44] <crimsun> Flannel: heh, I was about to say, I don't see it published on LP or in the archive
[12:45] <abes> mnepton: oh well... if you say so...
[12:45] <mnepton> abes: i would look around and remove all the stuff you installed manually
[12:46] <abes> mnepton: i didnt add much though.... just the plugin files which i already removed
[12:46] <Flannel> crimsun: yeah, apparently all -backports searching results in an edgy search.  Filing bug now ;)
[12:47] <mnepton> abes: i know that "sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree" has worked on 95% or more of the clean Dapper and Edgy machines i have touched.
[12:48] <abes> mnepton: oh well... i am the other 5% or less :p
[12:49] <crimsun> abes: the real kicker is why firefox refuses to notice _any_ plugins whatsoever
[12:49] <crimsun> are you sure you're invoking the system-wide /usr/bin/firefox ?
[12:50] <abes> crimsun: id tell you if i knew what you mean...
[12:50] <crimsun> abes: how are you starting Firefox?
[12:50] <abes> crimsun: i click on the icon...
[12:51] <dogfood2006> i would like ll to invoke ls -l a | less
[12:51] <crimsun> abes: in the upper panel? Have you modified its command path?
[12:51] <dogfood2006> where do i map this command?
[12:51] <abes> crimsun: no i haven't
[12:51] <crimsun> dogfood2006: ~/.bashrc if I remember
[12:51] <crimsun> dogfood2006: look in the aliases
[12:51] <abes> crimsun: firefox %u is now
[12:51] <dogfood2006> isn't that my bash history file crimsun
[12:51] <crimsun> abes: and what does ``which firefox'' return?
[12:52] <crimsun> dogfood2006: no, your bash history is (unsurprisingly) ~/.bash_history

[12:55] <NET||abuse> hey guys, i've got a server in a datacenter on a very cut down ubuntu 6.06 install, now they seem to have configured it with a set of custom apt sources, using uni-erlangen.de as the mirror server,, now one thing that i find from the configuration is there's no ftp daemon available from those sources
[12:55] <A[D] minS> is there download manager like Prozilla ?
[12:55] <abes> mnepton: well i run celeron... so i guess its i686 - aint it?

[12:56] <NET||abuse> Flannel: thanks :)
[12:56] <dogfood2006> yeah bashrc is the correct file to modify to put aliases for commands
[12:56] <crimsun> NET||abuse: you might want to hang a few days before installing proftpd.

[12:58] <jamichael> fuck that i don't need you guys
[12:58] <crimsun> jamichael: right on.
[12:58] <mnepton> and crimsun is right. if you *must* run FTP, use vsftpd.
[12:58] <poolkey172> jamiechael hold on
[12:58] <NET||abuse> mnepton: no, i can run pretty much what i want, and i'm configuring my ipchains to be selective on services

[01:00] <mnepton> NET||abuse: use vsftpd. seriously.
[01:00] <narcotic> how can i install the possible packets to my ubuntu?
[01:01] <NET||abuse> hmm, well i was going for economy of effort on this setup and was going to just run ispconfig
[01:01] <NET||abuse> and htey ask for proftpd
[01:01] <crimsun> NET||abuse: yes, I know. Note how the debdiff is for Edgy, hence why I mentioned you will want to wait since you want Dapper.
[01:01] <mnepton> vsftpd is a *much* smaller threat silhouette

[01:02] <Cuddles_Laptop> running edgy on a dell latitude laptop, with a gigabit wireless card [r818x driver] , and wireless will -not- auto-start.  i have to run kwireless, and then do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart to get an ip assignment.
[01:02] <NET||abuse> mnepton: you make a good argument,, i'll read more and consider that option
[01:02] <babo> does ubuntu come with a movie player ?
[01:02] <Davidovich> totem
[01:03] <pty> yes babo: totem
[01:03] <NET||abuse> totem, but i'ts pants
[01:03] <Davidovich> you better use mplayer
[01:03] <Davidovich> or vlc
[01:03] <Davidovich> those are great
[01:03] <NET||abuse> get rid and get something like mplayer vlc or xine
[01:03] <pty> vlc ftw :)
[01:03] <Davidovich> hehe
[01:03] <Trist_an> I agree with Davidovich
[01:03] <poolkey172> Cuddles_laptop : check the mac is registered in /etc/iftab
[01:03] <babo> Davidovich: neither of those come installed though right ? ... my friend is trying ubuntu, but he doesn't have the net yet. He wants to watch movies on it ...
[01:03] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, checking
[01:04] <Davidovich> just install them

[01:04] <NET||abuse> hmm
[01:04] <pwuertz_> hi, I want to overwrite int.__mul__ or float.__mul__, how can I do that?
[01:04] <Davidovich> you can install mplayer easily in synaptic packetmanager
[01:05] <babo> NET||abuse: he doesn't have the internet ...
[01:05] <Davidovich> ah
[01:05] <pwuertz_> sorry wrong chan
[01:05] <NET||abuse> babo: if they're newb to linux, or ubuntu in general, try something like easyubuntu or i dunno, havn't tried that automatix thing, but that either
[01:05] <dogfood2006> I just added an alias to my bashrc file, what do i need to do for it to engage?

[01:06] <efox> one minute wireless works then it doesnt
[01:06] <babo> NET||abuse, I don't see how that's going to help to be honest with you. He still won't have the internet ;-)
[01:06] <headbang> hi, are there any images available of edgy eft for DVD, but which arent 3,5 gig  in size, just having the normal install like on cd`s
[01:06] <NET||abuse> what card chipset and driver setup are you using?
[01:06] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, added it, anything else?
[01:06] <NET||abuse> babo: sorry, didn't catch your comment on the no internet first time round
[01:07] <NET||abuse> well, i don't know what multimedia stuff is on the default cd, but you could try mirroring the whole repository and burning it to a dvd and giving it to hiim :)
[01:07] <Davidovich> yeah, but probably you need a lot of codecs
[01:07] <poolkey172> Cuddles_laptop : /etc/iftab should be in the order that the kernel detects your network cards check this by cross referencing with dmesg
[01:07] <NET||abuse> then mirror the non free repository too :)
[01:08] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, only one network card in this system, fortunately.
[01:09] <poolkey172> Cuddles_laptop : what is the interface name of your wireless card ? check with ifconfig
[01:09] <jamichael> i need only i little help
[01:09] <Cuddles_Laptop> wlan0
[01:09] <poolkey172> jamiechael :wassup
[01:10] <Davidovich> then i recommand vlc, its nog very big, you can download and burn it on cd with another computer
[01:10] <jamichael> hi poolkey

[01:37] <genii> Hello.. has anyone done a mass install with headless clients?
[01:37] <Cuddles_Laptop> userek, if you want to make your system completely unusable, sure.
[01:37] <poolkey172> userek : why would I want to do that ? debian is way better than ubuntu :)
[01:37] <Hyouketsu> i prefer ubuntu =P

[01:37] <userek> many nice toys for kids
[01:37] <userek> etc

[01:38] <Cuddles_Laptop> userek, just backup your data, and do a fresh install. easier, and more stable that way.
[01:38] <Davidovich> i posted the latest messages
[01:39] <Davidovich> i suppose there dhcpd.conf is nog right configurated
[01:39] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, any luck?
[01:40] <poolkey172> davidovich : looking
[01:40] <Hyouketsu> rbrtoclto: did u install your sound drivers?
[01:40] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : looking
[01:40] <userek> bah
[01:40] <userek> i don't like the easy and more stable ways :)
[01:40] <rbrtoclto> hy: playback works fine, it's playing through the wrong sound card though
[01:40] <Cuddles_Laptop> userek, doing it the way you mentioned will only crash the system.
[01:41] <IdleOne> poolkey172,  Thank you
[01:41] <userek> Cuddles_Laptop alright then
[01:41] <Jerusalem420> I downloaded a torrent that contains .BUP, .IFO,  and .VOB, files. i tried burning it as is to a dvd blank
[01:41] <Jerusalem420> didn't work
[01:41] <userek> i'll pass
[01:41] <Jerusalem420> what do i need to do?
[01:41] <poolkey172> Idleone : welcome
[01:41] <userek> thanks
[01:41] <IdleOne> Jerusalem420,  you need to go ask the person you downloaded from this is a warez help channel
[01:42] <IdleOne> is=isnt
[01:42] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : bear with me : I have a similar problem of interfaces not coming up on both with another machine where I copied the whole OS onto a new disk
[01:42] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : u didnt do something like that did u ?
[01:42] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, nope. fresh install on this laptop.
[01:43] <Jerusalem420> idleone i wasn't asking about the efficacy of what I was doing. I was asking for a technical solution to my problem
[01:43] <IdleOne> and like I said the solution to your problem isnt in here
[01:43] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : ure wireless card is pcmcia right ?
[01:43] <Cuddles_Laptop> jerusalem420, idleone is right. try asking somewhere else.
[01:44] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, correct.
[01:44] <punkforjesus> i recently got a game http://www.happypenguin.org/show?Frozen%20Bubble and was wondering how to install it?
[01:44] <genii> Anyone used LTSP or NMT (if it has a release yet) to do a mass network install, or a similar idea? I have 1500 identical systems to try and streamline installs somehow
[01:44] <IdleOne> Jerusalem420, the solution involves ubuntu users who follow the CoC to do something elligal. not going to happen sorry
[01:45] <Jerusalem420> fine.
[01:45] <Jerusalem420> i'll just ask my linux junkie former roomate.
[01:45] <Jerusalem420> shalom
[01:45] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : I need your bootlog too : I cant see why this is happening ps remove that line from /etc/iftab we dont need it no more
[01:45] <IdleOne> later
[01:45] <KomiaPoika> is there a good and recent howto for exim on ubuntu (host server and relay)?
[01:45] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, ok, which file exactly do you need?
[01:46] <Fade> did a bad tar package get pushed out to edgy yesterday or the day before?
[01:46] <poolkey172> Cuddle_Laptop : /var/log/boot BUT what I would like to know what ifconfig -a looks like before you manually bring up wireless
[01:47] <poolkey172> Cuddle_Laptop : pcmica brings up the card ok
[01:47] <kr0n1x> hi,hi
[01:48] <kr0n1x> cronholio ?:p
[01:49] <Cuddles_Laptop> pool, i'll reboot and paste it to a temp file.
[01:49] <rbrtoclto> to answer my own question before - I had to apt-get install gnome-media and run gstreamer-properties
[01:49] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop hold on
[01:49] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop I was posting in the wrong channel
[01:50] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : after reboot I need those file plus ifconfig -a before bring up the net
[01:50] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, another problem just came up... touchpad just died again.
[01:50] <Cuddles_Laptop> ''lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away''

[01:52] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, ''can't access shared memory area.''
[01:52] <punkforjesus> how do i compile a game i downloaded?
[01:53] <kr0n1x> punkforjesus read the readme.txt if there is
[01:53] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : df -k
[01:54] <ChrisBradley> poolkey172 - submitted to sourceforge for review
[01:54] <genii> punkforjesus - in console in top dir of the source, try first sudo ./configure, then sudo make, then sudo make install
[01:54] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, can't cut/paste right now, what am i looking for?
[01:54] <poolkey172> ChrisBradley : good : and the sooner u start developing the better
[01:54] <punkforjesus> ok ill try that genii
[01:55] <genii> punk - you may need some prereqs like build-essential
[01:55] <punkforjesus> and the readme file was not helpful
[01:55] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : if lib modules volitile is mounted
[01:55] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, it is.
[01:56] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : wonders if this is an issue with pcmcia-utils / cd
[01:56] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : wonders if this is an issue with pcmcia-utils / cs not being able to bring up the card
[01:56] <Cuddles_Laptop> dunno poolkey172. it just started this last night.
[01:57] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : pcmcia-utils/cs is what is bringing up the card at boot it would be best to look there
[01:57] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : did it work be4 ?
[01:58] <abyss> hello anyone knows if there exists precompiled packages for Ralink-Chip based WLAN USB Pendrives?
[01:58] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, the network card has never worked automatically, but the touchpad started locking up randomly last night.
=== hfgh is now known as flashnet
[01:58] <rasman> abyss, do you know the chipset that is used?  prism2 is a common one
[01:59] <abyss> i wish it were so! No its an rt2500 similar adapter
[02:00] <rasman> abyss, have you tried 'modprobe -l rt2500' ?  I was able to find a driver under Edgy
[02:00] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : u there ?
[02:00] <i7ch> hi. i changed my xorg.conf input device section to use "synaptics" touchpad driver rather than the standard mouse one. now my touchpad works, but external usb mice don't. how can i have both at the same time?
[02:00] <abyss> i think i have the dapper
[02:00] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, yes, waiting.
[02:00] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : can u give me /etc/defaults/pcmcia
[02:01] <i7ch> or, another question: how do i know what the /dev/device is for my usb mouse?
[02:01] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey, can't cut/paste right now.
[02:01] <rasman> i7ch, You will need to define both devices in the xorg.conf file
[02:01] <abyss> rasman, well your right :) -> /lib/modules/2.6.15-26-386/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rt2500/rt2500.ko
[02:01] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, if i reboot now, what do you need before i manually start the networking?
[02:02] <vincent\> Hello, I need some help. I can't get my dvd writer working, though cd writing/burning and dvd reading works. Is this a common issue ?
[02:02] <rasman> i7ch, usb mice are /dev/input/mice
[02:02] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : on reboot....
[02:02] <rasman> vincent\, it should work automagically through nautilus.  Are you running Dapper?
[02:02] <i7ch> rasman, but my touchpad is currently working with the same /dev. is it ok to have two inputdevice sections for /dev/input/mice, one for the usb and another for the touchpad?
[02:03] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : it's not going to help ; can u give me /etc/default/pcmcia
[02:03] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : reboot is not going to help ; can u give me /etc/default/pcmcia
[02:03] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey, i can't cut/paste it.
[02:03] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : :(
[02:03] <vincent\> rasman, yes I am, it fails through nautilus, k3b, gnomebaker, even with growisofs
[02:03] <genii> i7ch you can have almost any number of input or output devices there in the xorg file
[02:04] <abyss> rasman, the problem is that the stick is already connected but lspci wont show it up! Any idea how to get the stick work?
[02:04] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : lol yes u said mouse trouble : ok then reboot : and check if u can do : ifdown wlan0; ifup wlan0
[02:04] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, no such file/directory anyway.
[02:04] <vincent\> rasman, it says roughly : :-[ WRITE@LBA=0h failed with SK=3h/ASC=72h/ACQ=01h] : Input/output error, which I dont understand.
[02:04] <i7ch> thanks genii, rasman. trying it now.
[02:04] <Wikipedia-Gast> why
[02:04] <RichiH> are there any known issues with installing from 6.10's live cd?
[02:04] <rasman> abyss, try lsusb to see if it showed up there
[02:04] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : there must be ? pcm* ?
[02:04] <Wikipedia-Gast> why
[02:04] <RichiH> kubuntu, not ubuntu
[02:04] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, i have to do the ifdown/up anyway
[02:05] <Wikipedia-Gast> why
[02:05] <RichiH> Wikipedia-Gast: please stop
[02:05] <RichiH> why, yes, haha
[02:05] <abyss> rasman, but iwconfig shows up : rausb0    RT2500USB WLAN  ESSID:"" ...... etc! Do that mean that the stick is ready for use?
[02:05] <Wikipedia-Gast> why
[02:05] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, no pcm either.
[02:05] <RichiH> anyway, it can not mount anything on the cd
[02:05] <RichiH> which.. sucks ;)
[02:06] <JuJuBee> I wish to learn java.  What program should I install to write code in java/
[02:06] <rasman> vincent\, You might want to search google for a particular firmware problem with your device.  Once I was able to burn CDs I was able to burn DVDs
[02:06] <ChrisBradley> poolkey172, what are the odds of a first submission to sourceforge being accepted? Probably depends on the letter to the editors right?
[02:06] <poolkey172> cuddles_laptop : Have a read of this http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/cardmgr-to-pcmciautils.html
[02:06] <rasman> abyss, That is a very good sign
[02:06] <poolkey172> ChrisBradley : I have created several sourceforge projects
[02:06] <rasman> abyss, try running iwlist rausb0 scan
[02:07] <Cuddles_Laptop> poolkey172, can't do that either. no mouse until i reboot.
[02:07] <abyss> rasman, no scan results
[02:07] <abyss> rasman, but i have here an wpa wnet

[02:33] <genii> Well the gist is there. But I suspect I will need to o some kind of acrobatics to not need a keybd/mouse/monitor on each client or some type of KVM deal. Perhaps a bootstrap kernel which has sshd so I can loop back to the server and use it as a control station etc.

[02:34] <enry183> how to kill a process
[02:34] <enry183> with shell?
[02:34] <NET||abuse> enry183: find the pid then do kill -9 pid
[02:34] <enry183> ok
[02:34] <NET||abuse> that was anice lunc
[02:35] <NET||abuse> lunch
[02:35] <enry183> but if server x is down
[02:35] <gnomefreak> enry183: killall pid
[02:35] <gnomefreak> ebreplace pid with the apps pid
[02:35] <NET||abuse> enry183: ctrl+alt+f1 to get to terminal
[02:35] <genii> enry first do ps ax   then note the PID number beside the process to kill. then type sudo kill -9 #    where # is the PID # noted earlier
[02:35] <enry183> ok thanks
[02:35] <gnomefreak> NET||abuse: he should already have tty
[02:35] <NET||abuse> enry183: to get the pid, do ps aux | grep apname get the pid from the first column, then away you go
[02:35] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: <enry183> but if server x is down
[02:36] <gnomefreak> NET||abuse: when X is down you get dropped into tty
[02:36] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: not always
[02:36] <joejaxx> genii: you will have to tell the debian installer in a preseed file the answers to the questions it will ask
[02:36] <gavi1> I'm back. I'm trying to install Xubuntu with the LiveCD, it just gives me the error "Error reading from CD" when I tell it to run the env. What could this be? I've burned 2 CDs from different servers, both check out OK and both were burned at low speed!
[02:36] <enry183> ok and after tipe ctrl-alt-f1
[02:36] <NET||abuse> login
[02:36] <gnomefreak> NET||abuse: always if X doesnt start
[02:36] <enry183> how to return to normal?
[02:36] <gavi1> I also tried installing with the alternate CD, but for some reason it won't boot from it, even though it was working fine yesterday :  ((.
[02:37] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: he didn't say X didn't start, he said it was down, might have crashed no?
[02:37] <enry183> yes

[02:38] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: doesn't on my edgy system at home,, after blue screen it goes to a blank black screen, or the screen hangs with ungarbage colected artifacts from blue screen and no tty
[02:38] <NET||abuse> enry183: you have a username: prompt now no?
[02:38] <genii> gavi1 - some CDROMS don't do reading of crammed CDs really well especially Mitsumi for instance. Try a different cd drive.
[02:38] <enry183> yess
[02:38] <enry183> ok mi question
[02:38] <gnomefreak> if that happens just use alt+F1 maybe alt+f2
[02:38] <enry183> is how to rerturn
[02:39] <enry183> my question is how to return at normal desktop
[02:39] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: this is why enry183 needed a hint on what to do no?
[02:39] <gavi1> genii: The LiveCD worked for Ubuntu, even though I didn't have enough RAM to fully load it. And the alternate CD was working yesterday D  ;.
[02:39] <NET||abuse> enry183: if X has crashed, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[02:39] <enry183> after ctrl-alt-f1
[02:39] <gnomefreak> enry183: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop  than sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[02:39] <gnomefreak> enry183: if your using gdm
[02:39] <NET||abuse> gnomefreak: true :)
[02:39] <gnomefreak> enry183: did you kill the proccess?
[02:39] <enry183> yes
[02:39] <gnomefreak> enry183: than run those commands
[02:40] <arepie> how to clear cache memory?
[02:40] <NET||abuse> is 3ddesktop the one that does the spinning desktop arrangement (not beryl)

[02:40] <gnomefreak> arepie: sudo apt-get clean or sudo apt-get autoclean
[02:40] <enry183> yes
[02:40] <enry183> 3ddesk sometime crash
[02:40] <NET||abuse> enry183: why bother, why not load beryl?

[02:41] <shadukan> guys any good howto on installing ati driver for laptop T1(9000)?
[02:41] <gavi1> genii: Yeah, I did that after I downloaded it the second time. I've tried everything I know but it just doesn't run anymore. The only thing I've done is partitioning, but I don't see how that could affect anything.

[03:07] <enry183> there is a soft like superkaramba for gnome...i whant a docking bar MAC-OS like
[03:07] <sirk> I mean its an audigy card, even my onboard card was able to handle multiple apps
[03:07] <gavi1> Where can I find out how to install Xubuntu from an unrelated LiveCD?
[03:08] <enry183> there is a soft like superkaramba for gnome...i whant a docking bar MAC-OS like
[03:08] <slavik> and gksudo doesn't work, I presume becausee of this ... and X dies the first time it is started by gdm
[03:08] <sirk> crimsun, and how do I get e.g. Amarok and Audacity working in the same time?
[03:08] <crimsun> sirk: I doubt your onboard does.
[03:08] <slavik> enry183: what is gDesklets.
[03:08] <crimsun> sirk: are both audio cards enabled in Linux?
[03:08] <sirk> crimsun, but I was able to run more than just one app using sound
[03:08] <sirk> crimsun, I disabled the onboard in my bios
[03:08] <sysrage> gdesklets are crap.. cool idea, but horribly buggy
[03:09] <crimsun> sirk: because we work around your hardware's insufficiency in alsa-lib
[03:09] <sirk> lspci doesnt also show it anymore crimsun
[03:09] <crimsun> sirk: that's fine. Did you create an asoundrc or something?
[03:09] <enry183> it similar to superkaramba??
[03:09] <sirk> yes I did, yesterday but I was not at my pc. I did it over the network with ssh, shall I post it? crimsun
[03:09] <KnowledgEngi> exist some software that consent to convert ape to mp3 ?
[03:10] <sirk> crimsun, http://nopaste.php-q.net/257637
[03:10] <crimsun> sirk: remove your asoundrc
[03:10] <sirk> did
[03:10] <lect0rs> Is there any otherway to install firefox themes offline?
[03:10] <lect0rs> the additional themes dialog box commands are all grayed out
[03:10] <crimsun> sirk: that asoundrc you pastebinned is useless
[03:10] <crimsun> sirk: let alsa-lib do its own work
[03:11] <atoponce> lect0rs: you need to download the themes to your desktop from the addons page
[03:11] <sirk> crimsun, okay
[03:11] <atoponce> lect0rs: then you can install them through file -> open
[03:11] <MarcN> KnowledgEngi: I've never heard of that format.  Is there a player for Linux? If so, you could use vsound to grab the audio as a WAV and then convert to mp3 or ogg
[03:11] <sirk> so everything should work fine if I let everything be? :P
[03:11] <genii> Engi - if you feel brave http://sourceforge.net/projects/ape2mp3/
[03:11] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: I explained an approach above
[03:11] <piglit> if i try to open all tabs from a bookmark folder it only opens one tab in Firefox how can i fix it that it wil open al tabs?
[03:11] <sirk> crimsun, then I also remove the /etc/asound.conf I created
[03:12] <diomede> hi, there's some irish girl please?
[03:12] <crimsun> sirk: correct
[03:12] <crimsun> diomede: ...what does that have to do with anything Ubuntu-related?
[03:12] <atoponce> diomede: wrong channel
[03:12] <j0hnni> Hey mates
[03:13] <j0hnni> Was just wandering...how can I use two monitor in Ubuntu 6.10, I have Ati x700 (sucks, yes) and I am going to use Aixgl/Xgl with Beryl...is this even possible?
[03:13] <diomede> where i can find some Irish?
[03:13] <atoponce> diomede: wrong chanel!
[03:14] <sirk> well, I'll take that audigy back to the store some day, they ripped me off, I payed 40 for that... I could get one for ~25 on the internet
[03:14] <sirk> or a better card from ebay for that price
[03:14] <sirk> what I will probably do
[03:14] <j0hnni> I have working aixgl+beryl but it runs on the fresh install "drivers" (the resolution 1024x768 works for now)
[03:14] <whyameye> I'm thinking of installing RAID but before I do...how does ubuntu/dmraid/whatever notify me if one of the disks in the raid goes down? I've googled for this and can't find anything
[03:15] <Master_Frag> u could esaly find a X-FI on ebay for 50$    i got one a week ago   50$
[03:15] <slavik> the person looking for a cool dock, look into kiba-dock :)
[03:16] <sirk> Master_Frag, as I said, I'm not that pro with sound cards :) that's why I took a creative, because I thought they were quite good
[03:16] <Master_Frag> they are
[03:16] <sirk> what is a X-FI?
[03:16] <Master_Frag> creatives top of the line card
[03:16] <slavik> sirk: Audigy3 generation of sound cards from Creative
[03:16] <sirk> for 50 bucks
[03:16] <slavik> pretty nice
[03:16] <sirk> well, aren't there soundcards from creative for about 170?
[03:17] <Master_Frag> yes
[03:17] <slavik> sirk yes there are
[03:17] <dxdemetriou> can I see my files on mobile with nautilus like the bluetooth:/ on konqueror?
[03:17] <sirk> Do the vendors from ebay ship cards from the US to europe?
[03:17] <sirk> because you guys have pretty nice prices over there
[03:17] <slavik> sirk: depends on the individuals ...
[03:18] <Master_Frag> thats the x-fi but i found one on ebay for 50   so an audigy3 is junk comperd to x-fi
[03:18] <slavik> sirk: I blame the euro for all our troubles ...
[03:18] <slavik> Master_Frag: X-Fi is audigy3 ...
[03:18] <Master_Frag> no
[03:18] <Master_Frag> no possible way
[03:18] <sirk> slavik, I love the dollar, because its so cheap. You pay the same "amount" almost everywhere, but obviously its much cheaper to buy it with dollars
[03:18] <Master_Frag> Audigy is in its 4th gen
[03:18] <gavi1> Hi, does anyone know where I can find out how to install Xubuntu through a totally different LiveCD? (particularly, gparted)
[03:18] <sirk> that's what I did with an ipod
[03:19] <slavik> Master_Frag: much like Pentium D is Pentium5 :)
[03:19] <sirk> I saved about 90$s just because of buying it in the US
[03:19] <slavik> Master_Frag: are you sure?
[03:19] <Master_Frag> im sure
[03:19] <slavik> Master_Frag: audigy, audigy2, x-fi ... no?
[03:19] <Master_Frag> look at creatives website
[03:19] <slavik> sirk: we will wield a war on europe for such exploitations :(
[03:20] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun: wine MAC.exe file.ape ??
[03:20] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: I think you need to specify more parameters
[03:20] <sirk> slavik, don't forget to exchange your money before!
[03:20] <sysrage> anybody feel like explaining to me when you would use upgrade, when you would use dselect-upgrade and when you'd use dist-upgrade?
[03:20] <slavik> sirk: good point
[03:20] <Master_Frag> no its  SB Audigy1 SBLive Audigy2 audigy3 audigy4 X-FI
[03:21] <slavik> Master_Frag: looks like x-fi is not even an sb ...
[03:21] <genii> Engi to execute "mac" you need to have the Monkey Audio Codec installed from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/
[03:21] <slavik> I don't see audigy3 though
[03:21] <Master_Frag> i know im missing several genarations but i cant type That fast
[03:21] <slavik> oh, nvm
[03:21] <KnowledgEngi> user@ubuntu:~/Documenti/MP3/BACH$ ls *.exe
[03:21] <KnowledgEngi> flac.exe  lpac.exe  MAC.exe  optimfrog.exe  shorten.exe  wvunpack.exe
[03:21] <slavik> damn it
[03:21] <KnowledgEngi> lpaccodec.dll
[03:21] <slavik> x-fi is sound blaster
[03:21] <Master_Frag> audigy3 was a failure
[03:22] <slavik> audigy, audigy2, audigy 4 ... wtf?
[03:22] <KnowledgEngi> genii, i have downloaded this files
[03:22] <slavik> I guess they pulled 3 ...
[03:22] <Master_Frag> to many bugs in the chipset
[03:22] <slavik> Master_Frag: care to join #ubuntu-ooftopic?
[03:22] <Master_Frag> ok   one sec
[03:23] <sirk> well, I have to say the X-Fi looks like a pretty nice device
[03:23] <sirk> especially the gold-effect
[03:23] <enry183> ok i installed  gDesklets
[03:23] <enry183>  but it is allways in first plane
[03:23] <enry183>  over the open windows
[03:23] <slavik> sirk: creative is also nice with support, they sent a card to the alsa people
[03:23] <enry183> helpp
[03:23] <sirk> cool
[03:23] <Master_Frag> ya   alot of there cards have the gold chrome
[03:23] <enry183> helllp
[03:23] <KnowledgEngi> genii, can you show me an example for convert an APE file?
[03:23] <KnowledgEngi> usin mac.exe ?
[03:23] <KnowledgEngi> usinG
[03:24] <enry183> sirk help me
[03:24] <sirk> well, the store I got my audigy from is like a library, you can bring back all the shit you get there...
[03:24] <sirk> in two weeks
[03:24] <Master_Frag> lol
[03:24] <sirk> and I mean its a huge store
[03:24] <Master_Frag> Never get a SBLive
[03:25] <genii> Engi - I am looking into this right now.
[03:25] <Master_Frag> they suck
[03:25] <sirk> why?
[03:25] <sirk> lol
[03:25] <Master_Frag> ^
[03:25] <Master_Frag> that was the worst generation
[03:25] <gogitotx> someone know the xgl channel?
[03:25] <sirk> ok, so I REMOVED the .asoundrc
[03:25] <Master_Frag> i have one
[03:25] <sirk> gogitotx, #xgl
[03:25] <sirk> you have one?
[03:25] <gogitotx> thanks
[03:25] <sirk> for what?
[03:25] <Master_Frag> but i use it for legasy apps
[03:26] <sirk> I think I sould reboot to apply my changes right?
[03:26] <genii> Engi perhaps try something like: wine mac.exe inputfile.ape - -d | flac -o outputfile.flac
[03:26] <sirk> because I would like to enable multiple application support with my card
[03:26] <Master_Frag> "i hate to admit it but i have win 95 on vmware"
[03:26] <slavik> ahh, in terminal, whenever I do sudo anything, it asks me to enter the password, then asks me for it again
[03:26] <enry183> somebody help me with gdesklets
[03:27] <sirk> sladen, sounds like you forgot your password :P
[03:27] <enry183> it's allways over the other windows
[03:27] <sirk> enry183, you don't use kde, do you?
[03:27] <enry183> gnome
[03:27] <Jaak_> !beryl
[03:27] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[03:27] <whyameye> Let's say I have a mirrored raid and one of the disks goes down. After I replace the disk, how do I have ubuntu recreate a good mirrored raid?
[03:28] <sirk> brb, hopefully with a system running amarok and audacity at once!
[03:28] <enry183> no beryl my video card is an intel integrated
[03:28] <gogitotx> join #xgl
[03:29] <Grishkin> hi
[03:29] <gavi1> hello
[03:30] <mschoolbus> hi
[03:30] <gavi1> a/s/l/ubuntu distro?
[03:30] <slavik> ahh, in terminal, whenever I do sudo anything, it asks me to enter the password, then asks me for it again
[03:30] <slavik> gavi1: this isn't AOLX or anything like that ...
[03:30] <mschoolbus> lol
[03:31] <gavi1> slavik: I know. sudo is probably asking again because you entered the pass wrong.
[03:31] <slavik> gavi1: no, I entered it correctly ...
[03:31] <sirk> slavik, I did everything you said, but still I dont get audacity working with amarok
[03:31] <slavik> gavi1: and gksudo doesn't work (just goes away after password is entered)
[03:31] <sirk> :(
[03:31] <KnowledgEngi> genii, http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/G9DY9q33.html
[03:31] <slavik> sirk: I never told you to do anything :P
[03:32] <crimsun> sirk: that's because audacity uses oss emulation, which is exclusive on your hardware
[03:32] <gavi1> slavik: OK, I don't really know. sudo does the same thing when you enter the wrong password, that's all.
[03:32] <sirk> slavik, well I removed the changes I did yesterday
[03:32] <sirk> crimsun, how can I get this working? shouldn't alsa-oss do this for me?
[03:32] <crimsun> sirk: you can't use both oss emulation _and_ alsa apps simultaneously on your hrdware
[03:32] <crimsun> sirk: a-o won't work for audacity.
[03:32] <sirk> ah..
[03:32] <sirk> sad...
[03:32] <crimsun> well, not really.
[03:32] <mschoolbus> is nvidia geforce 4 mx 440 compatible with compiz in the repositories or must I build from cvs?
[03:33] <crimsun> feisty's audacity has native alsa support.
[03:33] <sirk> crimsun, I need it!
[03:33] <finalbeta> !sru
[03:33] <ubotu> sru is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates
[03:33] <KnowledgEngi> user@ubuntu:~/Documenti/MP3/BACH$ wine mac.exe Sviatoslav_Richter.1972.J.S.Bach.Das_Wohltemperierte_Klavier.cd1.EAC.ape - -d | flac.exe -o outputfile.flac
[03:33] <KnowledgEngi> bash: flac.exe: command not found
[03:34] <KnowledgEngi> but flac.exe is into the current directory
[03:34] <gavi1> Has anyone installed xubuntu/ubuntu using an unrelated LiveCD?
[03:34] <slavik> crimsun: any ideas on my issue?
[03:34] <crimsun> slavik: I haven't been reading backscroll. Summarise?
[03:34] <sirk> any of you soundblaster guys know how to use the master channel to change the volume?
[03:34] <mjr> sirk, sirk install alsa-oss; it might work if you run audacity through it (command "aoss audacity" I think)
[03:34] <eltese> Anyone who can help me with ntfs-3g?
[03:34] <mjr> ah, oops, somebody already mentioned it doesn't work; nevermind
[03:35] <sirk> mjr, well... it does xd
[03:35] <sirk> I can run amarok playing music AND use audacity with aoss
[03:36] <genii> Engi You don't want to use flac.exe there. You want to pipe the output of wine into the linux command flac
[03:36] <slavik> crimsun: when I try to sudo anything, it asks me for password a second time after I enter it correctly the first time ... I assume this is the reason why gksudo doesn't work (just goes away after password is entered, no error messages) and X dies the first time it is started up (when gnome is almost done loading everything)
[03:36] <mjr> well, good for you then
[03:36] <onno> HELP: I lost my internet connection on my ubuntu Edgy Wireless Centrino
[03:36] <slavik> I changed my password before and it helped the issue, but it came back and changing password doesn't work anymore
[03:36] <mschoolbus> i love amarok, but in edgy it doesn't seem to like my ipod :\ unless you have to do stuff to get it to work (unlike 13)
[03:36] <crimsun> sirk: now try getting the capture to work correctly :)
[03:36] <sirk> lol
[03:37] <krang> How do you perform a zone transfer with nslookup? It says the ls command is not implemented
[03:38] <genii> Engi perhaps try cut and paste this:
[03:38] <genii> wine "mac.exe Sviatoslav_Richter.1972.J.S.Bach.Das_Wohltemperierte_Klavier.cd1.EAC.ape - -d" | flac -o outputfile.flac
[03:38] <j0hnni> How do I setup cloned screens with radeon driver?
[03:38] <genii> Engi In this format you may need to specify full pathnames
=== shredder_ is now known as shredder
[03:40] <[BTF] Chm0d> what is the recommended remote desktop application for linux to connect to windows?
[03:40] <genii> ultravnc
[03:40] <[BTF] Chm0d> is that free?
[03:40] <slavik> crimsun: what does this mean? >> Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
[03:41] <mjr> [BTF] Chm0d, tsclient
[03:41] <slavik> what is doing the authentication?
[03:41] <mjr> or grdesktop
[03:41] <eltese> !fuse
[03:41] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[03:41] <jwise> hello,boys
[03:41] <crimsun> slavik: who's returning it?
[03:41] <genii> btf yes, totally free. This is the windows server/client
[03:41] <sirk> do you know any virtual keyboard application that uses alsa?
[03:41] <[BTF] Chm0d> yea ive tried grdesktop
[03:41] <slavik> crimsun: gksudo gedit ...
[03:41] <jwise> is there any software in linux like source insight?
[03:41] <sirk> to record sounds, with different instruments on my pc?
[03:42] <jwise> I don't want to use vim to view some big project...
[03:42] <slavik> jwise: an IDE?
[03:43] <jwise> slawik,yeah,
[03:43] <KnowledgEngi> genii, i have installed flac for linux
[03:43] <slavik> jwise: anjuta/kdevelop are two popular ones for C/C++
[03:43] <slavik> eclipse is popular for java ...
[03:43] <KnowledgEngi> before use flac i must convert APE to AWE ?
[03:43] <jwise> slavik, thank you, I will have a try.
[03:43] <genii> Engi Good :) Hopefully the same command you tried before will work, but do not put flac.exe but just flac
[03:44] <berkes> does debian/ubuntu linux offer an option to set a hosts entry for a local account only? I mean: I can edit /etc/hosts just fine, but I am wondering if there is a way to set something in e.g ~/.hosts or so
[03:44] <pradeep> jwise, I haven't come across anything like source Insight so far
[03:44] <slavik> what does this mean? (gksudo gives this)>> Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
[03:44] <jwise> pradeep,so, how do you read codes?
=== laurens_ is now known as laurens
[03:44] <genii> Engi - No. The command at the end of the wine command ( - -d) means to decompress the file. This means it is just raw you do not need any intermediate format.
[03:45] <gnomefreak> slavik: still starts right?
[03:45] <SteveC> hi, what package do I need to install for the compiled kernel sources? linux-source just gives me a tarball of the source...
[03:45] <pradeep> jwise, I mean, in source insight you can move between stuff(functions,defs) easily
[03:45] <slavik> gnomefreak: yes
[03:46] <gnomefreak> slavik: its something with gksudo, there is nothing you can do about it really iirc. but its nothing to worry about
[03:46] <jwise> pradeep, yes, and vim can also can do with ctags, but, is there are too many files,using vim is less effective...
[03:46] <slavik> gnomefreak: sudo doesn't work properly either
[03:47] <gnomefreak> sudo and gksudo work fine.
[03:47] <gnomefreak> slavik: it gives same error?
[03:47] <slavik> gnomefreak: sudo asks for password, when I enter it correctly, it asks for it again
[03:47] <SteveC> apt-get install linux-headers it seems
[03:47] <gnomefreak> not error but same message
[03:47] <jwise> pradeep,sorry, change "is" to "if"
[03:47] <slavik> sudo doesn't
[03:47] <gnomefreak> slavik: for gui apps or for everything?
[03:48] <jvolkman> isn't NetworkManager supposed to ignore interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces?
[03:48] <genii> BTW does anyone know where linux-source-2.6.15-27 can be found?
[03:48] <gnomefreak> genii: in dapper
[03:48] <crimsun> genii: you meant linux-source-2.6.15
[03:48] <pradeep> jwise, yep. I'll try to look around ... there might be such an application :)
[03:48] <genii> apt-cahche search produces no result for any 2.6 kernel-source
[03:49] <gnomefreak> genii: apt-cache search kernel | less
[03:49] <crimsun> genii: because it's not kernel-source. It's linux-source, as I mentioned.
[03:49] <slavik> gnomefreak: GUI apps, like when I try to launch something that does gksudo first (like synaptic), it asks for password and then goes away and doesn't launch the app, no errors no nothing ...
[03:49] <gnomefreak> slavik: and your using edgy?
[03:49] <slavik> gnomefreak: dapper
[03:49] <gnomefreak> hmmmmm
[03:50] <genii> crimsun Sorry, had a blonde moment :)
[03:50] <genii> Thx
[03:50] <jwise> pradeep, i've looked for days, emacs,vim,lxr,geany...but never satisfied...
[03:50] <Crescendo> VNCviewer returns ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::SystemException: read: Connection reset by peer (104) when trying to connect to the server - how do I resolve this?
[03:50] <gnomefreak> slavik: this happens with just synaptic or anything in system>admin>* in the menu
[03:50] <slavik> everything
[03:50] <gnomefreak> slavik: did you enable su?
[03:51] <slavik> gnomefreak: ??? elaborate please
[03:51] <gnomefreak> slavik: than you didnt
[03:51] <gnomefreak> good
[03:52] <gnomefreak> slavik: im wondering if they are crashing or if the password is wrong :(
[03:52] <gnomefreak> slavik: try susdo synaptic let me know if same thing happens
[03:52] <gnomefreak> oops
[03:52] <mschoolbus> anyone have compiz skills? i have a few questions
[03:52] <Alam_Ubuntu> sudo
[03:52] <slavik> gnomefreak: the password is right

[03:53] <plutonas> hello, i installed a new wm, via apt-get but its name didnt come up on the gdm session menu. what can i do?
[03:53] <slavik> no error messages :)

[03:53] <slavik> yes
[03:53] <gnomefreak> good
[03:53] <Fade> oi. the kgpg package is seriously bjorked. :P

[03:53] <pradeep> jwise, but it's not free :)
[03:53] <slavik> from system->admin ... even if password is wrong, no error msg :-\
[03:53] <gnomefreak> ok there is an error in the way gksu is handling the app/password please file a bug on it
[03:53] <gnomefreak> slavik: yes i know
[03:53] <plutonas> i found on a forum, about gbm in general, that i have to edit a /etc/gdm/Sessions directory, but didnt find it
[03:54] <slavik> gnomefreak: I did ...
[03:54] <plutonas> gnomefreak: you should know about gdm
[03:54] <plutonas> :D
[03:54] <slavik> gnomefreak: also filed a support ticket thingy ... and usb automounting doesn't work :(
[03:54] <gnomefreak> slavik: gksudo is linked to gksu and its looking for the su password not sudo password. its a bug easliy fixed (for the devel)
[03:54] <gnomefreak> plutonas: what about it?
[03:54] <slavik> gnomefreak: bad QA then?
[03:55] <jwise> pradeep,can it be running on linux?
[03:55] <pradeep> jwise, yep
[03:55] <plutonas> how do i enter a new window manager in its sessions menu
[03:55] <pradeep> jwise, this shows exactly what you're looking for : http://www.slickedit.com/demo/low/CodeNavigation/CodeNavigation.html
[03:55] <jwise> pradeep,thanks,I will try with search engine-_-||
[03:55] <gnomefreak> slavik: no typo sortof
[03:55] <VSpike> is it normal to get from apt-get a huge list of packages which it says "The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required"
[03:56] <defrysk> VSpike, if you uninstalled a meta-package , yes
[03:56] <pradeep> jwise, search engine?
[03:56] <highneko> Can someone help me with this problem please? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1813183
[03:56] <plutonas> hey gnomefreak do you know?
[03:56] <gnomefreak> plutonas: do i know what?
[03:56] <gnomefreak> plutonas: you said i should know about gdm
[03:56] <slavik> gnomefreak: typo?
[03:56] <gnomefreak> i know enough about it
[03:56] <plutonas> how do i enter a new window manager in its sessions menu
[03:57] <gnomefreak> slavik: its a line in code slavik
[03:57] <jwise> pradeep, maybe i can search some free version,-_-||
[03:57] <soundray> gnomefreak: the question is how to make a newly installed alternative windowmanager appear in the gdm sessions list.
[03:57] <VSpike> defrysk: ah... so how can i find which metapackage contained these items?
[03:57] <plutonas> gnomefreak: how do i enter a new window manager in its sessions menu
[03:57] <pradeep> jwise, ok :)
[03:57] <slavik> gnomefreak: where? maybe we can fix it? and such?
[03:57] <jwise> pradeep,the demo seems wonderful,thank you:P
[03:57] <slavik> gnomefreak: why would sudo ask for password twice though?
[03:57] <soundray> plutonas: what wm did you install?
[03:57] <gnomefreak> you have to make a file for it. look at the wiki on e17 it should have the file and how to format it
[03:58] <gnomefreak> slavik: its not
[03:58] <defrysk> VSpike, dunno
[03:58] <plutonas> ratpoison
[03:58] <slavik> gnomefreak: it does ... at least for me
[03:58] <mschoolbus> ^it thinks you are lying maybe
[03:58] <gnomefreak> slavik: gksudo links to gksu. the gui apps use gksu by default. in this sence gksu is asking for su password not sudo password
[03:59] <plutonas> soundray: ratpoison, i think i have to highlight everything in here
[03:59] <slavik> gnomefreak: when I use sudo in a terminal, it asks me for my password, I enter it correctly. then it asks me for password again
[03:59] <gnomefreak> plutonas: i know but it will give you an idea on what file needs to be added along with an idea on what it should look like
[03:59] <soundray> plutonas: I've just installed it, too. Let me check if it appears in my sessions...
[04:00] <gnomefreak> slavik: than there is something wrong im willing to bet if you type sudo apt-get update than walk away for a minute or two and than type your password in it will work ;)
[04:00] <KnowledgEngi> genii, I has compiled and installed mac-3.99-u4-b5 and i has install flac from synsptic
[04:00] <gnomefreak> soundray: iirc ratpoison does not
[04:00] <KnowledgEngi> now i do not need to use wine
[04:01] <KnowledgEngi> can you show me the procedure to convert file.ape to file.mp3
[04:01] <KnowledgEngi> ?
[04:01] <gnomefreak> soundray: i had to do this for e17 a while back and i cant remember what file it is.
[04:01] <Fade> ah, it isn't kgpg so much as a critical glib failure in update-desktop-database.
[04:01] <genii> Engi - I posted a site earlier for you with this but will find it again :) afk
[04:01] <gnomefreak> brb
[04:01] <justin_> I installed KDE-BASE, and now I want to uninstall it can I? -- without messing up all of my system? Also, would it make things easier if I simply install "KUBUNTU-DESKTOP" and then apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop?
[04:01] <VSpike> That's interesting - if I do "sudo apt-get remove cupsys" it tells me I need to remove kubuntu-desktop as well
[04:02] <VSpike> I guess that's how that metapackage got uninstalled
[04:02] <justin_> VSpike: :( Welcome to the club of possible system destruction :S
[04:02] <soundray> gnomefreak: is is /etc/X11/Xsession.d ? (plutonas)
[04:02] <Jaak_> !beryl
[04:02] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:02] <plutonas> soundray i will take a look, did you find it there?
[04:02] <VSpike> I suppose if cupsys is part of the metapackage, it makes sense that the metapackage can't be considered "installed" if a bit of it has been removed
[04:03] <VSpike> but it didn't actually remove any of the other packages installed as part of the metapackagfe
[04:03] <justin_> VSpike: Are you feeling lucky?
[04:03] <justin_> :)
[04:03] <VSpike> justin_: well, I've already done it once without noticing and I'm still here :)
[04:03] <OffHand> hey guys
[04:03] <justin_> Basically if I want to remove KDE-BASE, it tells me it must remove ubuntu-desktop and some other apparently "Critical" part....
[04:03] <KnowledgEngi> genii, there is not the address. is to much up in the page
[04:03] <KnowledgEngi> i cannot get it
[04:04] <justin_> Well "xubuntu-desktop" anyways
[04:04] <OffHand> probably its the meta packgae
[04:04] <KnowledgEngi> becouse xchat do not store all that the people write in the channel
[04:04] <soundray> plutonas: no
[04:04] <soundray> plutonas: I found out what you have to do
[04:04] <KnowledgEngi> genii, can you rewrite the address?
[04:04] <plutonas> soundray: what?
[04:04] <justin_> I've had conflicting advice on this, some say you cannot remove KDE automatically once installed, and some say -- go for it nothing will happen....
[04:04] <genii> Engi - I am finding it again. Please have patience
[04:04] <KnowledgEngi> ok
=== zloc|afk is now known as zloc
[04:05] <OffHand> you can remove it as far as I know
[04:05] <justin_> OffHand: Ever done it?
[04:05] <VSpike> justin_: I guess the worst that can happen is you lose your desktop and have to apt-get install kde-base from the console
[04:05] <soundray> plutonas: 'echo ratpoison >>~/.xsession', then select Default System Session in gdm
[04:05] <OffHand> yeah justin_
[04:05] <sadiq> quick question.. anyone know of any projects/guides to installing (K)ubuntu from inside another Linux distro? (Laptop, no cd drive and don't seem to be able to get it to boot off of any of my usb media).
[04:05] <justin_> I dont want KDE again!! VSpike lol.. its horrid :P
[04:05] <OffHand> sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop
[04:06] <justin_> I want my XFCE and Flux thats it that's all, KDE was installed by mistake -- and now its an 800 meg waste of space :D
[04:06] <VSpike> justin_: my point is, you shouldn't end up in a worse place than you are now by trying it
[04:06] <goomie> I want to install gnome on my server install but dont want to do a apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.  I just want bare minimum
[04:06] <OffHand> would be nice if it was installed with aptitude though
[04:06] <gnomefreak> soundray: gksudo gedit /usr/share/xsessions/ratpoison i bellieve
[04:06] <goomie> What are the core gnome and X packages?
[04:06] <justin_> Ok.. VSpike this is question -- in doing this is there any way I may receive a "kernel panic" or lose the contents of my /home directory?
[04:06] <plutonas> soundray: thx, will try
[04:06] <dcordes> how can i change the brightness of an image in gimp?
[04:06] <OffHand> anyone have experience with compiling RT73 driver?
[04:07] <plutonas> soundray: i can still use gnome then right?
[04:07] <gnomefreak> as i said the e17 wiki shows you how to do it just replace the e17 parts with ratpoison
[04:07] <justin_> dcordes: That's for Ubuntu-offtopic I think :P
[04:07] <soundray> plutonas: yes, just make the appropriate selection in gdm again
[04:07] <justin_> e17 is great
[04:07] <justin_> buggy.. but it has potential
[04:07] <plutonas> thanks a lot
[04:07] <gnomefreak> and change the Exec line i think its in /usr/bin since you didnt compile it in opt
[04:08] <soundray> gnomefreak: for now it's solved via ~/.xsession, but I'll remember that, thank you
[04:09] <justin_> Oh that's ridiculous !
[04:09] <VSpike> justin_ : I can't say but it seems unlikely
[04:09] <justin_> I cannot remove KDE as a whole, when I try to remove KDEBASE, it only free's up 77k of space --- yay!
[04:09] <aleka> I have a very silly question.. but I am a NooB, so excuse my ignorance... I am sitting at an XP machine connected to my Ubuntu machine at home via ssh, I have a file(tar.gz) on the Xp machine that I want to Xfer to my Ubuntu machine... how do I do that.. i looked into scp, but that looks like it would work the other way
[04:09] <justin_> VSpike: Yeah I think I best back up my home dir :)
[04:10] <justin_> just in case..
=== ] ree[d is now known as [reed] 
[04:10] <boink> aleka: scp
[04:10] <VSpike> aleka: scp will work either way
[04:10] <boink> from the windows box? you could use winscp
=== driv[sleep]  is now known as drivera90
[04:10] <VSpike> aleka: use winscp
[04:10] <VSpike> boink: :)
[04:10] <boink> there's also pscp from putty
[04:10] <aleka> On the Xp machine I am on.. i don't know my username and host though
[04:11] <OffHand> sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop
[04:11] <KnowledgEngi> mac infile.ape outfile.wav -d
[04:11] <aleka> and scp requires that
[04:11] <OffHand> justin_,
[04:11] <boink> scp can use the ip number
[04:11] <boink> is it internal?
[04:11] <aleka> no...over the internet
[04:11] <onno> how do I set a password for open wep with iwconfig something like "iwconfig eth0 key s:xxxx" or "iwconfig eth0 key open xxxx
[04:11] <justin_> OffHand: I don't have "Kubuntu-Desktop" installed, I only installed the Base system.
[04:11] <boink> you know the url of your ubuntu box?
[04:11] <justin_> Maybe I should install kubunut-desktop as a whole, and then remove everything that way
[04:12] <OffHand> did you look in synaptic for kde?
[04:12] <aleka> yes.. I am currently connected to it (putty ssh)
[04:12] <boink> good, then if putty works, winscp will work too
[04:12] <soundray> justin_: you could install the kde package. Check 'apt-cache depends kde' and compare with 'apt-cache depends kubuntu-desktop'
[04:13] <genii> Engi try something like:
[04:13] <genii> mac Sviatoslav_Richter.1972.J.S.Bach.Das_Wohltemperierte_Klavier.cd1.EAC.ape - -d | flac -d | lame -b 320 -h outputname.mp3
[04:14] <OffHand> sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop && sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop
[04:14] <OffHand> so know one of you geeks got any experience with the RT73 driver for wireless?
[04:15] <josh_> hows it going all
[04:15] <josh_> how do i manage to log into the gui locally with the root account?
[04:15] <boink> josh: there isn't a root account in ubuntu
[04:15] <josh_> yes there is
[04:15] <OffHand> gksudo nautilus
[04:16] <josh_> u have to enable it
[04:16] <boink> yes
[04:16] <boink> to enable it :)
[04:16] <OffHand> use gksudo nautilus
[04:16] <josh_> yea i have enabled the account
[04:16] <josh_> where do i do a "sksudo nautilus"?
[04:16] <OffHand> no reason you need to log in as a root
[04:16] <soundray> josh_: and then you have to ask how to log into the gui. You're travelling down the wrong path, mate.
[04:16] <josh_> gksudo
[04:16] <genii> Engi - Possibly the flac line in the middle is not needed since the previous command decompresses the file theoretically.
[04:16] <OffHand> in the terminal josh
[04:17] <josh_> soundray: i know how to log into the gui... its getting in as root that is kicking my butt
[04:17] <OffHand> ^^
[04:17] <OffHand> dude, can I read?
[04:17] <boink> silly signoff
[04:17] <OffHand> I mean you
[04:17] <soundray> josh_: yes, exactly. Because you aren't supposed to.
[04:17] <josh_> ive changed my xorg.conf/x11 settings to allow it but it still wont
[04:17] <OffHand> I know I can
[04:17] <boink> josh_: is there a /root/ ?
[04:17] <josh_> yep
[04:18] <OffHand> I might aswell stop gicing tips
[04:18] <OffHand> giving
[04:18] <OffHand> if you ignore them anyways
[04:18] <josh_> i saw your tip... i knew about gksudo
[04:18] <josh_> i never sued it before though
[04:19] <josh_> s/sued/used
[04:19] <OffHand> well, I told you but you didn't seem to want to try it
[04:19] <mschoolbus> suing the makers of gksudo? :P
[04:19] <OffHand> could be me though
[04:19] <josh_> im more interested in being able to log in with root
[04:19] <OffHand> josh_, thats not recommended
[04:19] <soundray> josh_: why?
[04:20] <josh_> because i have managed to get every other computer in my house to allow it except ubuntu/kubuntu/edubuntu and its bugging me
[04:20] <soundray> josh_: that's not a good reason.
[04:20] <Master_Frag> might i suggest NOT going in as root. As if you mess something up in there your OS is gone...Yes i mean dead
[04:20] <soundray> josh_: ubuntu uses the sudo approach for security and managability. No need to mess it up.
[04:20] <josh_> ok, how about "because i dont want to get a "sudo" nautilus
=== genii is now known as genii-AV-kickedi
[04:21] <josh_> i use root for anything i do with the system
[04:21] <mschoolbus> if you logged in as root you would get a su nautilus, same thing
[04:21] <OffHand> then you are on your own josh_  but here is a tip: www.google.com
[04:21] <OffHand> :)
[04:21] <soundray> josh_: I'm sure you'll get your help somewhere, but not from me. Good luck
[04:21] <josh_> no mschoolbus, first i would have to log in as root, then kill xorg/gdm and bring it back up again
[04:21] <Master_Frag> im only goint ot repeat this once
[04:21] <Master_Frag>  might i suggest NOT going in as root. As if you mess something up in there your OS is gone...Yes i mean dead
[04:22] <mbadaro> does ubuntu have a gui?
[04:22] <rambo3> no
[04:22] <Master_Frag> noobish question
[04:22] <Master_Frag> yes
[04:22] <slavik> (10:00:22) gnomefreak: slavik: than there is something wrong im willing to bet if you type sudo apt-get update than walk away for a minute or two and than type your password in it will work ;)
[04:22] <Rossimo> mbadaro: for what, exactly?
[04:22] <OffHand> josh_, you are a wiseguy
[04:22] <mbadaro> in general
[04:22] <slavik> gnomefreak: why do you say that?
[04:22] <soundray> Master_Frag: it's not only about self protection. People who do everything as root lower the overall security level for us all.
[04:22] <mbadaro> does it have a gui?
[04:22] <josh_> Master_Frag: no need to tell me... i have busted my system before (using sudo no less) when i chmod 777 /usr
[04:22] <Rossimo> mbadaro: yes, its runs the gnome desktop environment
[04:22] <EdLin> josh_: the real problem with running root for everything is that instantly you've made any minor security problem into a root vulnerability
[04:23] <josh_> how so sound? last time i checked your computer had no connection with mine
[04:23] <[roger] > I'm looking for help updating a dapper server that's in a weird state. The symptom is that apache/apache2 php4 can't find mysql.so. I can't seem to get the right packages to install.
[04:23] <OffHand> hey google ftw: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_set.2Fchange.2Fenable_root_user_password
[04:24] <genii-AV-kickedi> mbadaro The usual ubuntu distro comes with GNOME desktop as it's graphical user interface. There is also a KDE version of ubuntu called kubuntu and an XFCE version of ubuntu called xubuntu. These all have different gui
[04:24] <josh_> so regardless of if i log in with root all day everyday using it for my normal non-system changing tasks... still wouldn't lower your security level
[04:24] <Master_Frag> i never go into root  if i have a major problem   i sempaly use the sudo xxxxxx Comand
[04:24] <soundray> josh_: by leaving your machine exposed to be turned into a botnet zombie
[04:24] <soundray> josh_: yes, indeed it would
=== genii-AV-kickedi is now known as genii
[04:24] <josh_> that is assuming i was logged in here as root.. which im not
[04:25] <soundray> josh_: that's not assuming anything other than what you've claimed
[04:25] <Master_Frag> no   you do not have to be in root to use sudo
[04:25] <misc--> is there a way to kickstart the clock? It's stopped!
[04:26] <soundray> misc--: killall gnome-panel
[04:26] <josh_> i didn't claim to be logged in as root right now
[04:26] <justin_> josh_: If you stay logged in as root, thats bad news waiting to happen..
[04:26] <misc--> soundray: not running X
[04:26] <soundray> josh_: that's also not what I assumed
[04:26] <justin_> I was once drunk and root, it was horrible :))
[04:26] <misc--> actually I think this is a vmware issue
[04:26] <KnowledgEngi> genii, i has converted from file.ape to file.wav
[04:26] <KnowledgEngi> and now '
[04:26] <KnowledgEngi> and now ?
[04:26] <josh_> im simply asking how i can enable local root user access to the gdm.... i can already do it remotely...
[04:27] <brucedawson> I'm having the same problem as [roger] , Seems it won't install the libmysqlclient15off package due to a dependency on a later mysql-common.
[04:27] <josh_> its just the local that seems to not be acceping the settings
[04:27] <KnowledgEngi> somebody suggest use lame
[04:27] <justin_> josh_: You could try "gdmsetup"
[04:27] <soundray> josh_: and I'm simply answering that that is not a sensible or reasonable thing to do
[04:27] <justin_> brucedawson: You cannot get the dependancy\?
[04:27] <genii> Engi That is odd it went to wav and not mp3. But you can play it now?

[04:29] <soundray> oops, sorry guys
[04:29] <ubinsp> maybe my CD audio is special
[04:30] <mjr> ubinsp, cdparanoia is your best bet, or one of the GUI frontends, and they generally provide WAVs and not audio cd images, though a raw audio CD image is not very useful anyways
[04:30] <brucedawson> [Roger] : I would try reinstalling the mysql-common package. Looks like there's a later one out there, but I don't know why we weren't informed of the update.
[04:30] <Kishore> Hi all

[04:33] <zylche> Yes.

[04:36] <highneko> I have some things on both sides of my panels, and I can't get rid of them. There's no option for this in the properties. They're not the hide arrow things. I found nothing in gconf-editor, but I could have missed it.
[04:37] <soundray> fabiim: I haven't got the experience myself, but I don't think it'll be very hard work.
[04:37] <zylche> works now, thanks!
[04:37] <crys> sweet - I finally have wireless on laptop
[04:37] <fabiim> ok thanks .
[04:37] <Rossimo> np
[04:37] <soundray> fabiim: people have even managed to get Win XP up and running, and Ubuntu is a lot easier to install
[04:38] <zylche> ubuntu is a lot quicker to install, and if you are reinstalling [I did so yesterday]  and the power goes out [twice last night -_-]  then it doesn't completely fark the computer.
[04:39] <[roger] > justin_: /etc/apt/sources.list has dapper main restricted universe multiverse, dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse, dapper-security main restricted universe. I don't think that's the problem.
[04:39] <mschoolbus> i had to reinstall last night too - problems getting compiz to work, then problems getting it back to normal :/
[04:40] <mbadaro> where could i go to install ubuntu?
[04:40] <vdepizzol> I'm using ubuntu 6.10 in a computer with Pentium D 64bit, but it's very slow to open apps
[04:41] <soundray> vdepizzol: 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' -- is it logging any errors?
[04:41] <soundray> mbadaro: can you rephrase your question please
=== darius is now known as Darius
[04:41] <mbadaro> where can I download ubuntu?
[04:42] <tristan_> does ubuntu 6.10 include gtk+ 2.10 ?
[04:42] <ruilobao> mbadaro, www.ubuntu.com
[04:42] <tristan_> http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease
[04:42] <tristan_> heh
[04:42] <tristan_> I am there.
[04:42] <[roger] > justin_: I think apt's deps are just confused. do you know how to clear it and start from scratch?
[04:42] <soundray> mbadaro: http://www.ubuntu.com/
[04:43] <brucedawson> [roger] ,_justin: I think something isn't catching the fact that mysql-common is out-of-date and needs to be updated. The mysql-common packages on simon and river are different. (simon and river are two near-identical servers)
[04:43] <slavik> ubuntu is starting to piss me off and I don't like it ... I like to know why I am being pissed off
[04:43] <slavik> local authentication issues (having to enter password twice to log int) ... any ideas
[04:44] <eltese> Anyone good with ntfs-3g?
[04:44] <slavik> Nov 29 10:44:33 localhost sudo: (pam_unix) unrecognized option [slavik]  << the option is my username ...
[04:45] <poolkey172> Hi anyone know what file I edit to change or add a windows manager to kdm ?
[04:46] <genii> slavik sounds like some fall-thru authentication on PAM someplace
[04:46] <slavik> genii: fall-thru meaning it doesn't authenticate properly?
=== michael is now known as MTeck
[04:47] <genii> slavik yes... it would go through it's list ion order of methods to use, the first match wins. But above that winning match may be something which produces a login request and fails.
[04:47] <slavik> hmm, genii, could you pastebin your /etc/nsswitch.conf please?
[04:47] <emmende> hi there!, has someone working with debyl??
[04:47] <slavik> emmende: debyl is a russian curse-word, you mean beryl
[04:48] <emmende> I have a problem when trying to do wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/quinn.key.asc --quiet -O - | sudo apt-key add -
[04:48] <emmende> slavik: yes sorry!
[04:48] <r0g> pls anyone have solved problems with edgy and compiz with nvidia and amd-64? board and howto and faq are confused
[04:48] <genii> slavik I'm currently on a Windoze box and my 2 other linux machines here are setup with custom auth stuff which is no use to you
[04:48] <slavik> emmende: beryl-project has server troubles
[04:48] <Darius> dont use compiz is the answer r0g
[04:48] <Darius> use beryl
[04:48] <mschoolbus> r0g: i had problems trying to install compiz yesterday :(
[04:48] <slavik> genii: active directory stuff?
[04:49] <r0g> :(
[04:49] <Darius> No point in using compiz anymore
[04:49] <mschoolbus> why?
[04:49] <Darius> beryl <3
[04:49] <genii> slavik No, RADIUS and NIS type stuff
[04:50] <emmende> slavik: there is another alternative???
[04:50] <slavik> oh, ok
[04:50] <slavik> emmende: not that I know of
[04:50] <mschoolbus> whats the difference between beryl and compiz? and will it work well with a p4 and geforce 4 mx 440 ?
[04:50] <Darius> beryl and cmpiz = practically the same
[04:50] <slavik> mschoolbus: wouldn't try it
[04:50] <Eula> Buenos dias!!!
[04:50] <Darius> just compiz doesnt get updated anymore i dont think
[04:50] <timo90> Did any one know about the release: Ubuntu Christian Edition 2.0
[04:50] <Darius> beryl does
[04:51] <slavik> so, genii, any ideas where to look?
[04:51] <r0g> ya ya beryl but he is not unstable?
[04:51] <Darius> yes lol
[04:51] <Darius> christian edition rofl
[04:51] <Eula> hello!!!
[04:51] <slavik> !ask
[04:51] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:51] <slavik> !ru>slavik
[04:51] <genii> slavik I'd try poking around in the pam.conf and see what methods it's trying in what order and go from there
[04:52] <kalemika> My system hangs on bootup after it says Checking File Systems [ok] 
[04:52] <timo90> WOW I have software updates today !
[04:52] <sysrage> WOW!
[04:52] <r0g> ok thnks Darius i try with beryl
[04:52] <slavik> genii: everything there is commented out ...
[04:52] <kalemika> I've fixed it a few times by replacing ipw3945.ko but I have to keep logging in as root on the recovery option and re-patching. Is there anything I can do to avoid this?
[04:53] <timo90> the  Christian Edition 2.0 sounds really inmproved
[04:53] <genii> slavik: hangon 1 sec I'll ssh into one of my boxen and see the file structure, it may be another file is needed to look at
[04:54] <slavik> k
[04:54] <slavik> genii: my /etc/pam.d/common-auth is kind of weird
[04:54] <zntneo> Does anyone in here have experience using bcm43xx
[04:54] <slavik> I think it's weird, anyway
[04:54] <timo90> i think these too many linux  distributions  ?
[04:54] <slavik> zntneo: I do ... and it's a bad one :(
[04:54] <NaMcO^> hi
[04:54] <slavik> timo90: I would disagree
[04:54] <kalemika> Can someone please help me out here... I have a major report due tomorrow and I can't boot my computer normally.
[04:55] <Darius> any error messages?
[04:55] <zntneo> slavik:  i'm geussing you didn't get it to work?
[04:55] <kalemika> No error messages.
[04:55] <slavik> zntneo: I did and then it stopped working ...
[04:55] <timo90> Why, you oviusly havent seen them , or heard about them
[04:55] <genii> slavik - back. Yeah that is the one I was just gonna recommend you look at
[04:55] <slavik> genii: should I pastebin it?
[04:55] <Darius> whats it do exactly?
[04:55] <slavik> !pastebin
[04:55] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:55] <timo90> obviously*
[04:55] <kalemika> Okay. I start up the computer.
[04:56] <kalemika> The normal startup screen with the progress bar shows up for a while...
[04:56] <zntneo> any clue what authentication repsonse received from mac address but no queue item exists means? its in my dmesg
[04:56] <genii> slavik - sure
[04:56] <slavik> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34802/
[04:56] <kalemika> Then hangs about half-way. Then I get dumped to a text console which says like, Checking File System [ok]  and I can move the cursor and stuff but it won't boot past there.
[04:56] <dxdemetriou> the bluez-utils from /etc/default/ is bluetooth now on edgy?
[04:56] <Darius> corrupt?
[04:56] <kalemika> No.
[04:56] <timo90> slavik:Imagine if they worked on mabe 3 and made them perfect ?
[04:56] <kalemika> Because if I replace ipw3945.ko in root in recovery mode
[04:57] <zntneo> my card with bcm43xx almost works
[04:57] <kalemika> It'll boot again a couple times.
[04:57] <kalemika> Then I have the same problem.
[04:57] <zntneo> iwconfig says its associated with an ap
[04:57] <slavik> genii: it looks to me as if it is trying to authenticate through AD first ... (I removed the settings that do AD stuff from samba.conf)
[04:57] <kalemika> I read it has something to do with like, a wireless 802.11 overheat switch or something.
[04:57] <highneko> What's a good program for playing dvds. Mplayer isn't working for me with dvds.
[04:57] <genii> slavik Are you actually using kerberos? If not you should probably comment out that line 13
=== ] ree[d is now known as [reed] 
[04:57] <Darius> try and disable your wireless card or take it out
[04:57] <zntneo> can anyone help me with bcm43xx
[04:57] <Darius> then reboot
[04:58] <zntneo> Darius:  you talking to me?
[04:58] <kalemika> I need my wireless card.
[04:58] <slavik> genii: which line should come before the kerberos line?
[04:58] <slavik> is it the one right under it?
[04:58] <kalemika> Also it's internal.
[04:58] <kalemika> Is it possible that ubuntu is reverting back to the old ipw3945.ko
[04:58] <sirk> does anyone know a good midi keyboard emulator which I can use with jack?
[04:58] <kalemika> And if so, how do I prevent it from doing this?
[04:58] <Darius> kalemika: what card/drivers?
[04:58] <timo90> slavik:They still doing great work thuo
[04:59] <kalemika> darius: It's a broadcom, I think. I had to use DriverLoader to get it to work.
[04:59] <slavik> timo90: every distro is to suit some need
[04:59] <Darius> try and use ndiswrapper i have a broadcom belkin and it works fine in ndiswrapper
[04:59] <r0g> cu later good permanence to all
[04:59] <LordOfHeat> anyone managed to install ethereal in dapper drake?
[04:59] <kalemika> It doesn't work.
[04:59] <kalemika> I've already used ndiswrapper, I spent a day configuring and it simply wouldn't work.
[04:59] <slavik> genii: you rock, it works :D
[05:00] <LordOfHeat> I get some wierd errors while running ./configure
[05:00] <Darius> go on the ndiswrapper wiki and look for your card
[05:00] <aleka> I have a vnc question that I can't get answered in the forums... anyone up for it?
[05:00] <zntneo> how do i turn bcm43xx off so i can try ndiswrapper?
[05:00] <timo90> slavik:Lol you cant pleas every one
[05:00] <genii> slavik it looks like some dead whitespace there right now before that kerberos line. I would remove or comment that whitespace line. Then just comment out the kerberos line itself and then see if you still get a double login. The other auth method under should be the default then.
[05:00] <kalemika> It hangs right before Mounting Root Filesystem
[05:00] <kalemika> If that helps
[05:00] <slavik> genii: just commenting out the krb line works :)
[05:01] <genii> slavik Cool :) Glad to help
[05:01] <slavik> genii: here's another problem, usb automounting not working anymore :(
[05:01] <Darius> im sure is saw a thread on the ubuntu forum about loader hangs
[05:01] <slavik> genii: off to write it on the forums and wiki ...
[05:02] <slavik> genii: could it be when the krb stuff is installed, it puts the line there?
[05:02] <genii> slavik unfortunately I don't have much experience with that, wish I could help more
[05:02] <slavik> genii: was worth a try :P
[05:02] <slavik> !pam_unix
[05:02] <genii> yup
[05:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pam_unix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:03] <genii> Is this bot somehow wired to the wiki?
[05:03] <slavik> genii: no, unless you put in a factoid to point to wiki
[05:04] <genii> Ah OK

[05:04] <slavik> no bofh bot

[05:06] <jesus> hello
[05:06] <jesus> please help
[05:06] <aleka> I was using the package vncserver to set up a vnc connection. When I log in remotely from an Xp machine, I just see the Ubuntu splash screen and nothing else.. what am I missing in my configs?
[05:06] <slavik> genii: I think my password was getting rejected by krb and then the local auth would ask for it .. does this seem logical to you?
[05:06] <jesus> iam updating one wiki of ndiswrapper
[05:06] <Ksilebo> Anyone know how to force apt to go through a proxy?
[05:06] <Ksilebo> It simply refuses to get any updates
[05:06] <jesus> how i get my pciid from a hardware'?
[05:06] <slavik> jesus: lspci?
[05:06] <jesus> ok thanks
[05:06] <jesus> :)
[05:06] <DevC> in ubuntu I just installed flashplayer in the /usr/lib/mozilla but it appears that it don't work with firefox? any idea how to get flash to work with firefox?
[05:06] <slavik> jesus: look into -v and -n options for it
[05:07] <genii> slavik: Yes, since you had only 2 auth methods, obviously the first one (kerberos) could not authenticate and it fell through to the next method
[05:07] <aleka> noone interested in helping with VNC?
[05:07] <dooglus> aleka: try running "pkill esd" in a terminal.  does that make the desktop appear?
[05:07] <slavik> genii: how should I name the wiki page?
[05:08] <slavik> genii: how does 'DoublePasswordPromt sound?
[05:08] <genii> slavik: I'm not sure... perhaps something like doubleauthfix  or similar
[05:08] <aleka> dooglus, same thing...
[05:08] <aleka> just the ubuntu screen
[05:09] <kalemika> Can someone help me with my boot problem? Ubuntu won't boot past "checking root filesystem"
[05:09] <dooglus> aleka: if you run 'pkill esd' while waiting at the ubuntu screen?

[05:09] <aleka> but I can not see any changes on the screen I get from my vnc viewer

[05:14] <Darius> Woodwizzle do:  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[05:15] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[05:15] <mc__> Ulven: i would say 500mhz and 256mb ram
[05:15] <Darius> and add :
[05:15] <Darius> Section "Extensions"
[05:15] <Darius>         Option "Composite" "false"
[05:15] <Darius> EndSection
[05:15] <Darius> to the bottom

[05:15] <mc__> Ulven: you're welcome
[05:15] <woodwizzle> Darius: Yup

[05:16] <zntneo> how do i stop bcm43xx module from loading?
[05:17] <dark_light> woodwizzle, here it worked only installing directly from ati installer :(
[05:17] <defrysk> zntneo, blacklist it
[05:17] <claudi1> hi...i'm new to ubuntu...i've installed it yesterday...the 6.10 version...i've a usb modem...i know that ubuntu have some problems with usb modems but it recognize mine....the modem is working (lights are still and don't turn off)....but i'm not able to create a connection....how can i do? pleaseee...help me
[05:17] <dark_light> woodwizzle, it has an option to generate ubuntu package
[05:17] <dooglus> aleka: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[05:17] <zntneo> defrysk: i try to remove it with modprobe and it says that module isn't found
[05:17] <aleka> heh, google took me to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/
[05:17] <Darius> woodwizzle: i'd try reinstall fglrx from synaptic or apt-get
[05:18] <dark_light> claudi1, it's a dialup modem? try sudo pppconfig
[05:18] <defrysk> if it loads and you dont want it to blacklist it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[05:18] <dark_light> claudi1, if it's a dsl modem, try sudo pppoeconf
[05:18] <defrysk> zntneo, it wil never bother you again
[05:19] <claudi1> dark_light...how i launch sudo?....i'm sorry...i'm new to this (ah but... pppoe should be for ethernet no? my modem is a usb modem)
[05:19] <zntneo> defrysk:  thanks
[05:19] <defrysk> !sudo | claudi1
[05:19] <ubotu> claudi1: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:20] <dark_light> claudi1, go to left-top menu, applications -> acessories -> terminal
[05:20] <dooglus> aleka: see line 125 - gnome-session is crashing for some reason
[05:20] <dark_light> claudi1, in terminal you should type sudo <yourcommand>, depending of your kind of modem
[05:21] <dark_light> claudi1, Hmmmm i dunno! i think pppoeconf should work.. well..
[05:21] <genii> claudi: pppoe or just ppp is how your modem talks to your service provider. The connection betwenn your computer and your modem is another thing.
[05:22] <dark_light> the problem is, pppoe means ppp over ethernet, eheh
[05:22] <genii> Yeah it confuses some ppl :)
[05:22] <claudi1> uhmmm
[05:22] <claudi1> ok
[05:22] <AnthonyG> Hello everyone :)
[05:22] <claudi1> but what will happen when i launch sudo pppoe? what i have to do?
[05:23] <AnthonyG> pppoe?
[05:23] <Plankton> claudil, you have to press ENTER
[05:23] <claudi1> what after pppoeconfig?
[05:23] <claudi1> ok
[05:23] <zntneo> defrysk: i blacklisted it now my mouse won't work
[05:23] <AnthonyG> Lol
[05:23] <Plankton> nothing^^
[05:23] <defrysk> :)
[05:24] <dark_light> well, it will ask for you password
[05:24] <claudi1> and it will create a connection?
[05:24] <Rorviker> I installed some nvidea things and now X wont start, any autoconfiguration I can run?
[05:24] <Plankton> claudil, yes
[05:24] <defrysk> zntneo, then unblacklist it you seem to need it :D
[05:24] <claudi1> ok
[05:24] <claudi1> wonderful
[05:24] <claudi1> thanks a lot
[05:24] <claudi1> now i try
[05:24] <dark_light> and then will ask questions about your dsl, either in text mode or graphical mode (it depends how your system is configured)
[05:24] <claudi1> thanks to all
[05:24] <AnthonyG> Would someone mind "make all"-ing this, And tell me if any errors are returned. I have a feeling it's my fault. http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/kernel-2.6/martian/martian-full-20061110.tar.gz

[05:24] <Plankton> np
[05:24] <claudi1> :)
[05:24] <AnthonyG> It needs build essential
[05:24] <zntneo> defrysk: how do i get a run command from the keyboard
[05:25] <AnthonyG> justin_: It's so powerful, It can bend reality to it's liking ;)
[05:25] <dark_light> AnthonyG, paste the output of make in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ (have you tried ./configure ?)

[05:25] <defrysk> zntneo, alt-f2
[05:25] <Rorviker> noclue: tar xfvz filename.tar.gz ?
[05:25] <justin_> noclue: What's the question?

[05:25] <ubinsp> bye
[05:26] <noclue> rorviker tried that
[05:26] <dark_light> noclue, sure there are a graphical way to decompress this, but i generally use tar -xvvzf file.tar.gz , it will decompress in current directory (yes, it is a command, typed on terminal)
[05:26] <dark_light> AnthonyG, paste it :)
[05:26] <AnthonyG> justin_: I'm not sure , I don't know what you mane by desktop, GNOME?
[05:26] <defrysk> zntneo, key in gnome-terminal
[05:26] <defrysk> zntneo, and hit enter
[05:27] <Rorviker> What driver should I choose for a Geforce 6200 card ?
[05:27] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Are you really going to force me to reboot due to an error in tweakcore.sh:1:Unexpected ")"
[05:27] <noclue> dark_light it tells me no such file or directory
[05:27] <dark_light> AnthonyG, why reboot?
[05:27] <zntneo> defrysk: thanks
[05:27] <tonyyarusso> justin_: kubuntu-desktop is a metapackage.  It merely helps install other things; it contains no actual programs within itself.
[05:27] <AnthonyG> dark_light: I'm on a dual boot machine :)
[05:27] <dark_light> noclue, that's because you are not in the right directory. where is the file?
[05:27] <AnthonyG> dark_light: XP at the moment
[05:27] <treak007> Rorviker, you can use the official nvidia ones
[05:27] <defrysk> zntneo, you know how to edit from the cli ?
[05:27] <dark_light> AnthonyG, oh.. hmm.. i think your ./configure failed
[05:28] <noclue> darrk_light it is on desktop
[05:28] <zntneo> yea
[05:28] <AnthonyG> That file is a modem driver
[05:28] <noclue> dark_light it is on desktop
[05:28] <defrysk> zntneo, cool :)
[05:28] <dark_light> noclue, cd ~/Desktop
[05:28] <zntneo> hmm my mouse still isn't working :(
[05:28] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Please, Make the package, If you only do a make all. It will not install anything.
[05:28] <dark_light> noclue, ~ means "your home". ~/Desktop means "Desktop inside your home"
[05:28] <Rorviker> treak007: I got some help from GeForce_ here yeasterday and installed some nvidea-XXXX packs, when I started to day I got following errors: "Failed to load module Nvidea", (Module does not exist). No Drivers available, No screens found"
[05:29] <noclue> dark_light i don't understand  <<< noob
[05:29] <dark_light> AnthonyG, well.. ok
[05:29] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Thank you so much :D
[05:29] <zntneo> what did i do to make it so my m ouse doesn't work
[05:29] <dark_light> noclue, :) well, you may work in various directories while in terminal, and you use cd to change the directory
[05:29] <AnthonyG> noclue: Omg , I am sorry, I thought you were making good humor yesterday.
[05:29] <noclue> dark_light i was at this for 6 hours lastnight and today for 3
[05:29] <treak007> Rorviker, in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, what does it say under device driver for your graphics card?
[05:29] <levander> Okay, my dist-upgrade to edgy hung on the message "Starting PCMCIA  services..." .  I had to reboot the computer.  The computer boots, and I can log into GDM.  But before the login completes, the desktop hangs and I'm just left with a brown background.  Someone can give me a hint what to check now?
[05:30] <noclue> anthonyg lmao :D
[05:30] <dark_light> noclue, you may type: cd ~/Desktop and then: tar -xvvzf nameofyourfile.tar.gz
[05:30] <AnthonyG> noclue: When you were telling me you don't know this and that (Trivial things) , It thought it was a joke :(
[05:30] <Rorviker> treak007: It said Nvidea I believe, I ran a config program to try to get X to start again so I think I choosed vga now..
[05:30] <noclue> anthonyg nope really don't know
[05:30] <zntneo> defrysk: any clue why my mouse still isn't working
[05:31] <l3on_> hi all
[05:31] <edd_> hey ppl
[05:31] <AnthonyG> noclue: Lol , Hmph... Wait until you forget to give shutdown any parameters XD
[05:31] <l3on_> i've a directory with this
[05:31] <l3on_> drw-rw-rw- 2 l3on l3on   744 2006-11-29 17:28 src
[05:31] <defrysk> zntneo, that weird
[05:31] <Solarion> so, anyone want to help me get stap to work?
[05:31] <l3on_> what means ?
[05:31] <defrysk> zntneo, sorry
[05:31] <zntneo> defrysk: i'm not mad
[05:31] <treak007> Rorviker, well, the error means that you did not install the driver properly
[05:32] <dark_light> noclue, that is.. your have a home directory, did you knew that? it's where your files are stored. the Desktop directory inside it is your desktop, but you may create other dirs
[05:32] <edd_> how do i install a driver??
[05:32] <tonyyarusso> l3on_: Everyone can write to it, not execute.  'man chmod' has all the details of those lines for reference.
[05:32] <sjoeboo> edd_:what 'driver'?
[05:32] <treak007> Rorviker, go ont aptitude and search for nvidia
[05:32] <noclue> dark_light had no idea honestly
[05:32] <zntneo> Just wondering what i did to make my mouse not work anymore
[05:32] <levander> One thing I noticed is that the edgy upgrade converted /etc/fstab to some other format with UID's in it, and the /home partition doesn't mount any more.  I manually mount /home with "mount /dev/hda4 /home" and I can log into a console.  But, not gdm.  Should manually mounting it that way be okay?
[05:32] <edd_> erm. for my wireless card
[05:32] <AnthonyG> edd_ : It depends on if you are compiling it from source or not.
[05:32] <Rorviker> treak007: maybe, I just used apt-get to get nvidea-glx and nvidea-xconf or something
[05:32] <l3on_> tonyyarusso, grazie thanks
[05:32] <dark_light> noclue, i am unsure if i should have pointed you to the terminal. but i don't know how to do it graphically, graphical tools normally confuses me
[05:32] <edd_> bcmwl5.inf
[05:32] <defrysk> zntneo, dit you modprobe and restrt x ?
[05:32] <w0jtas> hi, how can i change "mysql_query" text to "$db->query" in all files in catalog ?
[05:33] <dark_light> noclue, terminal instructions is always more clear to explain
[05:33] <AnthonyG> dark_light: How goes the compilation?
[05:33] <sjoeboo> edd_: what release of ubuntu are you running?
[05:33] <treak007> Rorviker, also becareful with your spelling, its nvidia, a mispelling in the xorg.conf would also cause the error
[05:33] <zntneo> defrysk:  i rebooted
[05:33] <edd_> edgy
[05:33] <Solarion> whenever I run stap, I get "libdwfl failure (dwfl_linux_kernel_report_kernel): No such file or directory Ensure kernel debuginfo is installed
[05:33] <dark_light> AnthonyG, making
[05:33] <defrysk> zntneo, check the blacklist again and check if you missed something
[05:34] <sjoeboo> edd_:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[05:34] <AnthonyG> Bah , Don't say that , 80% of Linux is terminals , Wait until you have to go into safe-mode(Brings back memories)
[05:34] <dark_light> AnthonyG, ld: Relocatable linking with relocations from format elf32-i386 (ltmdmobj.o) to format elf64-x86-64 (marscore.o) is not supported
[05:34] <edd_> ty
[05:34] <strabes> terminal is faster in most cases anyway
[05:34] <noclue> dark_light i have idea of how to use terminal i find that a better way than graphical
[05:34] <Rorviker> treak007: k, but I didnt edit the config, it was done when I installed one of the packages.. I'll try some more.. thx
[05:34] <zntneo> defrysk:  is it ok that i just commented out bcm43xx?
[05:34] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Error or warning?
[05:34] <treak007> Rorviker, there are tons of good tutorials on the internet on how to do this
[05:34] <dark_light> AnthonyG, seems a error :)
[05:34] <treak007> Rorviker ,for example http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074
[05:34] <defrysk> zntneo, should be ok yes but you could remove it to make sure of course
[05:35] <defrysk> the module that is
[05:35] <justin_> Grrr How do I re-install ?
[05:35] <justin_> meh i'll just format
[05:35] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Odd , I don't get any linker errors, What about other things? Does it complain about something titled tweakcore.sh?
[05:35] <justin_> damn you KDE! :P
[05:35] <defrysk> justin_, sudo apt-get install --reinstall
[05:35] <AnthonyG> justin_: Reinstall GNOME? Ubuntu?
[05:35] <dark_light> AnthonyG, no, then it did: make[1] : ** [marscore.o]  Erro 1 (Error 1)
[05:36] <dark_light> and exited
[05:36] <AnthonyG> dark_light: Nothing whatsoever about tweakcore.sh
[05:36] <AnthonyG> ?
[05:36] <noclue> dar_ light i keep trying these commands and it just tells me *no such file or directory*
[05:36] <dark_light> AnthonyG, no, i think it failed before going to this
[05:36] <dark_light> noclue, well, type ls
[05:36] <year0369> moin
[05:36] <dark_light> noclue, ls tells you what is on the current directory
[05:36] <AnthonyG> noclue: What is your problem in the first place?
[05:37] <dark_light> noclue, so if you are in Desktop, you should have see a .tar.gz file ..

[05:37] <forkmantis> When I issues a command like "ssh myubuntumachine 'echo $PATH'", it's obvious the .bashrc and .bash_profile have not run
[05:37] <kraut> how do i change the locales?
[05:37] <dark_light> noclue, so type: cd Desktop
[05:37] <kraut> !locales
[05:37] <ubotu> To set up and configure your locales, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf
[05:37] <AnthonyG> grndslm: Is this hypothetical?
[05:37] <dark_light> noclue, and then ls. you should see a .tar.gz now
[05:38] <forkmantis> if I "ssh myubuntumachine" and echo $PATH on the machine, then it is correct
[05:38] <ChrisBradley> poolkey172 -you still here?

[05:38] <noclue> dark_light  bash: cd: desktop: No such file or directory
[05:38] <forkmantis> how do I make it so that I can ssh machine 'command' and have .bashrc and/or .bash_profile execute?
[05:38] <dark_light> AnthonyG, well mmm dir is just a default alias (and well here isn't colored :~~)

[05:43] <dark_light> zntneo, what kind of mouse you have? i am not sure
[05:43] <zntneo> its a mouse for a laptop
[05:43] <dark_light> zntneo, usb mouse?
[05:43] <w0jtas> hi, how can i change "mysql_query" text to "$db->query" in all files in catalog ?
[05:43] <levander> Why did the edgy upgrade convert the format of my /etc/fstab file?
[05:43] <dark_light> the first thing i can think is: disconnect and reconnect it. lol
[05:43] <zntneo> no built into the laptop
[05:43] <AnthonyG> dark_light: I'll push through the errors , Thank you for the assistance
[05:44] <dark_light> zntneo, hmm.. have you changed your /etc/X11/xorg.conf recently?
[05:44] <sjoeboo> levander: odds are, it change from block devices (/dev/hda1) to UUID
[05:44] <zntneo> no let me do that
[05:44] <dark_light> zntneo, well if you didn't changed, your mouse config is intact (because it worked before..)
[05:44] <sjoeboo> levander: UUID is a unique id for devices, so that even if you move drives around inside, the system will know where your root is etc
[05:44] <sjoeboo> more or less
[05:44] <zntneo> dark_light:  correct
[05:44] <noclue> dark_light   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34809/plain/
[05:45] <noclue> what is this in my paste bin??
[05:45] <dark_light> zntneo, did you upgraded Xorg recently?
[05:45] <levander> sjoeboo: are UUID's interchangeable with partition names?  e.g., if my home partition didn't mount on boot with the UUID that edgy put in fstab, can i manually mount it they old way?  "mount /dev/hda4 /home"?
[05:45] <dark_light> noclue, that's fine! see your desktop
[05:45] <dark_light> noclue, there are a directory in your desktop now, click it
[05:45] <zntneo> dark_light:  i don't think so
[05:46] <dark_light> noclue, that is the files inside .tar.gz
[05:46] <noclue> dark_light directory??
[05:46] <dark_light> noclue, directory, folder..
[05:46] <zntneo> how can i check what my recent updates were
[05:46] <VigoFusion> How can I see my /usr/bin and let them run stuff and I do not have to be present.
[05:46] <dark_light> zntneo, Hmmmm.. i don't know .o
[05:46] <noclue> dark_light i have a new folder called tsemgr-0.08
[05:47] <dark_light> zntneo, paste your xorg.conf in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[05:47] <noclue> dark_light is that it??
[05:47] <dark_light> noclue, exactly
=== ok67_ is now known as ok67
[05:47] <dark_light> noclue, the files was printed in your screen because of the "vv" in tar -xvvzf
[05:47] <craigbass1976> Hey folks, I'm on a 28.8 modem and googling is worse than getting my teeth pulled.  Is there a bug on the ubuntu livecd that causes kernel panic and makes it unable to load up?  The same disc worked on another comptuer last night.

[05:48] <dark_light> zntneo, hm
[05:48] <dark_light> zntneo, why?
[05:48] <emmende> there is someone who knows a GOOD how to for beryl or compiz?? cos I always get stuck on the openGPG key
[05:49] <Pelo> craigbass1976,  forget  google and head straight for the ubuntu forum  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/

[05:49] <noclue> dark_light that is the file headed install
[05:49] <zntneo> dark_light:  i think i lost my internet on it too
[05:50] <dark_light> zntneo, :o
[05:50] <dark_light> zntneo, i have no idea. (why you can't paste your xorg.conf?)
[05:50] <dark_light> noclue, well, type cd tsemgr-0.08 to change to the new directory
[05:50] <noclue> dark_light what do i do??
[05:50] <dark_light> noclue, and inside it, type sh configure
[05:50] <zntneo> i'm trying to do an ifconfig and its not saying my network card anymore
[05:51] <grndslm> emmende:  what kinda hardware do you have?
[05:51] <dark_light> noclue, why you need to compile that? i think you will need build-essential too
[05:51] <grndslm> graphics wise?
[05:51] <dark_light> zntneo, :(
[05:51] <zntneo> i open up Network settings and nothing is there
[05:51] <dark_light> zntneo, as root?
[05:51] <zntneo> all i did was add one thing to the blacklist
[05:51] <Rug> My sound is broken.  I just reinstalled kubuntu (after trying suse, mepis) and it reports an error "no sound devices found".  This same box has been working fine with ubuntu since Hoary.
[05:51] <dark_light> zntneo, it is very odd
[05:51] <emmende> dark_light: ubuntu has by default AiGLX??
[05:51] <zntneo> yes
[05:51] <edd__> @zntneo: if it doesnt show your network card reinstall the driver, thats what ive just done to mine
[05:51] <Winand> why does my resolv.conf change nameserver back to default every time I start ubuntu?
[05:51] <dark_light> zntneo, what you added to blacklist? (and which blacklist, modules?)
[05:51] <noclue> dark_light i want to install the programme it's for music to my phone mp3 player
[05:52] <dark_light> emmende, no (at least not in current version)
[05:52] <zntneo> yes and i added bcm43xx to it then removed it
[05:52] <EvanCarroll> Does anyone have the url of a good tutorial for someone completly new to xen, to get it up and running with windows xp? using edgy.
[05:52] <grndslm> dark_light:  ubuntu 6.10 does have aiglx by default
[05:52] <zntneo> edd__:  how do i do that
[05:52] <dark_light> emmende, maybe it will have some sort of thing in edgy, i don't know if will be aiglx
[05:52] <edd__> erm ill find the link
[05:52] <dark_light> grndslm, sure? hmmm
[05:52] <grndslm> edgy's already out
[05:52] <dark_light> grndslm, never used it :o
[05:52] <emmende> which is better for use beryl, glx or AiGLX?
[05:52] <grndslm> emmende:  what kinda graphics card do you have?
[05:52] <edd__> zntneo: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[05:52] <grndslm> aiglx is usually better
[05:53] <dark_light> ops, s/edgy/feisty/
[05:53] <edd__> follow that through
[05:53] <emmende> grndslm: ATI fireglV3100
[05:53] <zntneo> edd__:  i also have a built in ethernet card
[05:53] <Agrajag> EvanCarroll: do you have a processor with the right virtualization technology to allow windows xp to run in xen?
[05:53] <zntneo> and its not working either
[05:53] <EvanCarroll> Agrajag: yes core duo
[05:53] <noclue> dark_light what is build essential????
[05:53] <dark_light> zntneo, well, if all this happened exactly after you changed, maybe it's time to undo the changes..
[05:53] <Winand> what is this "edgy" thing everybody talks about?
[05:53] <edd__> does it show that?
[05:53] <grndslm> emmende: you have the flgrx driver?  (I don't use ATI, i've got nvidia)
[05:53] <zntneo> dark_light:  i removed the line in the blacklist
[05:53] <Rug> Winand: it's the newest version of Ubuntu
[05:53] <emmende> grndslm: yes i've got it
[05:53] <zntneo> edd__: no
[05:53] <grndslm> emmende:  and are you using dapper or edgy?
[05:53] <Winand> oh
[05:53] <emmende> grndslm: dapper
[05:54] <edd__> mine only uninstalled wireless
[05:54] <dark_light> noclue, well, it's a package that permits you to compile most things.. it was intent to compile debian packages, but it helps you to compile things like this tsemgr
[05:54] <Winand> Rug: can you help me with something, my resolv.conf is changed to the default every time I restart ubuntu
[05:54] <dark_light> zntneo, i think the undo will work only after a reboot
[05:54] <grndslm> emmende:  eww...I haven't tried it with dapper...but edgy is a breeze to get beryl working on.  can you upgrade?
[05:54] <edd__>  ok, wireless card installed now. now i need a little help. i have a BCM4318 chipset but its not finding my wireless network. does anybody know how to fix this???
[05:54] <zntneo> dark_light:  i did reboot
[05:54] <dark_light> noclue, to install it: sudo aptitude install build-essential
[05:54] <claudi1> hi....i'm back
[05:54] <emmende> grndslm: yeahh why not
[05:55] <C_REATiVE_> Hy, usin edgy and my firefox2 is very slow sometimes [especially when im scrolling] 
[05:55] <grndslm> emmende:  if you can upgrade...then after getting your driver working again....all you have to do is type in "aptitude install beryl" and you're done
[05:55] <dark_light> zntneo, hmm
[05:55] <C_REATiVE_> is it fixable?
[05:55] <marcin32> hello all
[05:55] <dark_light> noclue, btw, why you need to compile this thing?
[05:55] <claudi1> so...the problem is still there.....i've launched pppoeconf and this is the result:  Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Concentrator of your provider did not
[05:55] <claudi1> respond. Please check your network and modem cables. Another reason  for the scan
[05:55] <claudi1> failure may also be another running pppoe  process which controls the modem.
[05:55] <grndslm> emmende:  but you should add this repository to your sources.list file before installing beryl:   # Beryl
[05:55] <grndslm> deb http://ubuntu2.lupine.me.uk edgy main
[05:55] <grndslm> deb-src http://ubuntu2.lupine.me.uk edgy main
[05:55] <zntneo> i'm thinking i need to reinstall
[05:56] <Rug> Winand: yeah, I hate that new "feature".  I am not running Edgy so I can't compare.  There is a command called resovconf that you can use to change your DNS settings.  Have you tried going through the "Admin" -> Networking menus to change it
[05:56] <noclue> dark_light i need it for my phone!! if i don't get it g/f will kill me lmao :)
[05:56] <craigbass1976> Pelo, sounds like it's got something to do with sata.  Is that something you've heard of?
[05:56] <dark_light> zntneo, maybe you should try to reinstall in another partition, just to test
[05:56] <dark_light> zntneo, or better, run the livecd
[05:56] <claudi1> it's obvious! cause i've not any modem connected to my ethernet card.....i've a usb modem........what i have to do???????????????????????????????????????
[05:56] <grndslm> emmende:  version 0.1.1, the default vers is buggy....that repository has the newer & more stable 0.1.2
[05:56] <marcin32> I have a problem with my tv card who would to help me?
[05:56] <zntneo> i was thinking of using the livecd
[05:56] <dark_light> noclue, phone? but.. it isn't at the repositories?
[05:57] <emmende> grndslm: do u have problems when trying to wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/quinn.key.asc --quiet -O - | sudo apt-key add -
[05:57] <Winand> Rug: I went to Admin ->Networking but I have to open that up every restart
[05:57] <edd__> i need a little help. i have a BCM4318 chipset but its not finding my wireless network. does anybody know how to fix this???
[05:57] <dark_light> zntneo, maybe if the livecd worked before and then don't works now, you have a hardware problem
[05:57] <noclue> dark_light have a sony ericsson w800i with mp3 player on it and i need some kind of software to transfer music
[05:57] <grndslm> emmende:  apparently beryl's servers crashed and they lost everything...but still have the code backed up on mirrors
[05:57] <grndslm> emmende:  they say it's an excuse to reorganize
[05:58] <emmende> yeah but the problem is the same with compiz
[05:58] <zntneo> edd__: did you try iwconfig?
[05:58] <edd__> yeah
[05:58] <emmende> what can i do?
[05:58] <zntneo> is it associaed with an ap
[05:58] <dark_light> noclue, well, maybe compiling this is your unique choice..
[05:58] <edd__> dont think so
[05:58] <claudi1> please help me... i've an usb modem (and it works) but i'm not able to create a connection to the internet... i've tried a pppoeconf but it has not worked cause (obviously) nothing is connected to my ethernet card
[05:58] <Rug> Winand: personally, I'm sticking with Dapper for awile.  Too many odd problems with Edgy.  Other then running the resovconf command to change it manually; I don't know what to tell you.
[05:59] <WhiteRabit> aaaaaaaaaargh! why can't i get an ftpd to run and accept connections?! I can do ssh or vnc... but i've installed and removed 4 different ftpd packages and I just can't connect! HELP... I've got 50 gig of music i'm trying to move onto my mythtv box
[05:59] <Anzas> i agree dapper is much better than edgy
[05:59] <dark_light> noclue, i didn't found anything useful with apt-cache serch ericsson
[05:59] <grndslm> emmende:  i'd seriously recommend upgrading to edgy, making sure your /home directory has its own partition if you haven't done that already, & aptitude installing beryl
[05:59] <craigbass1976> Does anyone know about issues with ubuntu (kernel panics when booting from livecd) and sata?
[05:59] <edd__>   Mode:Managed  Frequency=2.484 GHz  Access Point: Invalid
[05:59] <dark_light> noclue, try installing the build-essential, you will need it
[05:59] <claudi1> please help me... i've an usb modem (and it works) but i'm not able to create a connection to the internet... i've tried a pppoeconf but it has not worked cause (obviously) nothing is connected to my ethernet card
[05:59] <edd__> but the point is valid
[05:59] <VigoFusion> claudi: Have you tried the Synaptic Update Manager?
[05:59] <edan> can anyone tell me how to copile a game like frozen-bubble 2.0?
[05:59] <emmende> grndslm: ok i'll upgrade edgy  ;)
[05:59] <Rug> WhiteRabit: Use NFS, much faster for that much music
[05:59] <Winand> Rug: I am still using dapper too I thought
[05:59] <noclue> dark_light i think i did in synaptic but i dont see it anywhere
[05:59] <claudi1> no vigo
[06:00] <claudi1> Vigo.....what is that? and what should i do with it?
[06:00] <dark_light> claudi1, well i don't really know, i had a usb modem but had to buy a ethernet card because usbnet never worked with me
[06:00] <VigoFusion> claudi1: That would be a good place to start.
[06:00] <dark_light> noclue, there is a "search" function in synaptic..
[06:00] <Rug> Winand: ok try this. open a command prompt, and type:  sudo nano -w /etc/resolv.conf
[06:00] <emmende> grndslm: what do you mean with "making sure your /home directory has its own partition"
[06:00] <tsw> hi, is there any way to create a second ethernet loobpack device with another ip?
[06:01] <claudi1> but my usb modem is working....
[06:01] <zntneo> edd__: try doing iwconfig (your card) essid (your essid)
[06:01] <claudi1> Vigo....pleaseee......help me
[06:01] <WhiteRabit> thanks, i'll look it up
[06:01] <dark_light> claudi1, my usb modem worked -- but not with linux
[06:01] <claudi1> i'm going mad for this
[06:01] <edan> can anyone tell me how to copile a game like frozen-bubble 2.0?
[06:01] <Rug> Winand: tell me if it says anything about "dop not edit this file"
[06:01] <edan> compile*
[06:01] <Rug> ack.
[06:02] <dark_light> claudi1, i think ppoeconf will work with you if you have a proper usb kernel module installed to handle network (that is, usbnet)
[06:02] <claudi1> Dark....my usb works with linux....lights are on....and linux recognize it....but i don't know how to create a connection
[06:02] <Rug> Winand: "Do NOT edit this file..."
[06:02] <Winand> Rug: it just gets reset to the router address every reboot
[06:02] <dark_light> claudi1, hmmm
[06:02] <Rug> Winand: then your router is using  DHCP to reset your settings
[06:02] <edd__> it doesnt work cos my wireless is set as eth1 ? ? ?
[06:02] <dark_light> claudi1, ok, i sure don't know how to help you, sorry
[06:02] <VigoFusion> claudi1: The Synaptic Update Manager reads your devices and may be one there for your device, it is always good to look on the Forums also.
[06:03] <Winand> Rug: oh ok
[06:03] <Winand> Rug: is there a way to fix that
[06:03] <grndslm> emmende:  if you reinstall from cd (which is how i always upgrade) you can partition your hd into multiple logical containers...( / & swap & /home), so that WHEN you mess your computer up in the future...you can just reformat your / partition and SAVE all your configuration files & documents saved in the /home directory
[06:03] <abes> mnepton: hey... im back... still cant get the Flashplayer running on my firefox...
[06:03] <Rug> Winand: turn off DHCP on your router.
[06:03] <claudi1> Vigo....but my modem has been recognised.....but i don't know how to create a connection
[06:03] <Rug> My sound is broken.  I just reinstalled kubuntu (after trying suse, mepis) and it reports an error "no sound devices found".  This same box has been working fine with ubuntu since Hoary.
[06:03] <edd__> zntneo: Error for wireless request "Set ESSID" (8B1A) :   SET failed on device eth1 ; Operation not permitted.
[06:04] <Winand> Rug: I think what I'll do is just make the router's dns servers work right
[06:04] <zntneo> put sudo infront of it
[06:04] <edd__> ok
[06:04] <Rug> Winand: ok
[06:04] <nastas> hi all
[06:04] <Anatoly>  Hi, I have a problem zope3 on Ubuntu 6.1. TypeError: readline() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given). Python 2.4 installed from packages. Zope 3.3 compiled
[06:04] <Rug> nastas: howdy
[06:04] <nastas> anyone who knows about clamav?
[06:05] <edd__> then what? it just jumps back to normal command line
[06:05] <abes> crimsun: hey... im back.... flash still not working on firefox
[06:05] <VigoFusion> claudi1: Is the Device Manager seeing the device?
[06:05] <Norman> what about clamav
[06:05] <claudi1> YES Vigo
[06:06] <edd__> brb ppl
[06:06] <nastas> how can i scan a single file?
=== philip__ is now known as PhilipPryce
[06:06] <Norman> are you using the gui
[06:06] <PhilipPryce> i need some help mounting a share
[06:07] <claudi1> Vigo....the device manager sees my usb modem !!!!!!!!!!
[06:07] <devilsadvocate> nastas, scan for what?
[06:07] <nastas> for a virus
[06:07] <syn-ack> in Linux?
[06:07] <syn-ack> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[06:08] <emmende> grndslm: I see
[06:08] <zntneo> dark_light:  mouse works in livecd
[06:08] <claudi1> Vigo?????????????????
[06:08] <devilsadvocate> syn-ack, :)
[06:08] <nastas> i use an external usb hdd in ntfs format
[06:08] <dark_light> zntneo, so it seems odd
[06:08] <VigoFusion> claudi1: Its a wireless Etho? ,,,I am looking it up
[06:08] <claudi1> VigoFusion....can you help me?
[06:09] <edd_> ok now it finds my wireless, But, it wont connect to websites ?? help?
[06:09] <PhilipPryce> i need help mounting my windows share
[06:09] <claudi1> noo
[06:09] <grndslm> emmende:  if it's not possible for you to do that...make sure to run gksudo update-manager from a gui
[06:09] <dark_light> zntneo, you have a /home separated from / partition? if yes, reinstalling would not be so painful..
[06:09] <syn-ack> Hell, Im on WinXP right now and I havent had any virii on this computer in 4 years
[06:09] <zntneo> dark_light: i don't have anything on this right now anyway
[06:09] <grndslm> emmende:  apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't work so well for edgy, apparently
[06:09] <claudi1> VigoFusion....my modem is a "trust usb modem a235"
[06:09] <edd__> ok ty works now
[06:09] <dark_light> syn-ack, the problem is: how to know exactly?
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[06:09] <dark_light> zntneo, hmm. but anyway, i find a separated /home very useful :>
[06:09] <emmende> grndslm: I have added to sources.list # Beryl deb http://ubuntu2.lupine.me.uk edgy main deb-src http://ubuntu2.lupine.me.uk edgy main
[06:10] <syn-ack> dark_light: Because Im the admin, thats how I know.
[06:10] <emmende> and then sudo aptitude install beryl
[06:10] <VigoFusion> claudi1: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/connect-to-internet.html  I am still looking for particiliars
[06:10] <zntneo> how much space do i need for the other partitions?
[06:10] <emmende> it's ok? cos I haven't find any packet from beryl
[06:10] <dark_light> syn-ack, you can detect only known virus
[06:10] <claudi1> Vigo...ok...now i check....thanks a lot....see you later
[06:10] <PhilipPryce> can someone help me mount my windows share?
[06:10] <edd_> zntneo:  now it finds my wireless, But, it wont connect to anything. any ideas?
[06:10] <grndslm> emmende:  you have to upgrade to edgy first, tho
[06:11] <nastas> syn-ack:so i can just mount the hdd? it's my friend's hdd
[06:11] <zntneo>  did you do a sudo dhclient eth1?
[06:11] <syn-ack> Anyhoo, nastas, There is no such thing as a virus in Linux. The way the system is designed wont allow viruses
[06:11] <dark_light> zntneo, i don't know. i think 5 or 8GB for / is fine, 300MB or 500MB for swap, and the rest for /home
[06:11] <nastas> ok
[06:11] <edd_> dont think so
[06:11] <febuiles> Mmm, got a quick question, I'm about to install Ubuntu 6.10 on a Macbook, is it safe to go ahead with the normal CD download from the website or do I need some Live CD?
[06:11] <syn-ack> nastas: what is this a Windows disk you are trying to scan from Linux or something?
[06:11] <grndslm> emmende:  if you want to do that without downloading a cd or wiping out your /home directory....you need to change all dapper to edgy in your sources.list....and then run gksudo update-manager
[06:12] <zntneo> try that
[06:12] <nastas> yes
[06:12] <PhilipPryce> can someone help me mount my windows share?
[06:12] <edd_> yay
[06:12] <edd_> ty zntneo now works
[06:12] <syn-ack> nastas: So yeah, just mount the drive and scan it then
[06:12] <emmende> grndslm: that was my next question haha, ok ok i will change dapper to edgy
[06:12] <Moelmo> is here somebody who has a psp ?
[06:13] <noclue> can i install a windows app with wine?????
[06:13] <PhilipPryce> Moelmo: yes
[06:13] <noclue> like a .exe installer??
[06:13] <edd_> i have a psp

[06:13] <Moelmo> i cannot transfer anything to the psp
[06:13] <Rprp> How can i configure my ati driver?
[06:13] <budluva> Moelmo, ya i have a psp
[06:13] <claudi1> VigoFusion......i've read the guide...but my problem is not to install the usb modem....but to create a connection with it
[06:13] <Moelmo> neither on my memory stick if i use a cardreader
[06:13] <febuiles> noclue: yes
[06:13] <mschoolbus> noclue: yes, but its program specific on compatibility
[06:13] <edd_>  got network manager on
[06:13] <Moelmo> and the usb transfer doesnt work either
[06:13] <strabes> PhilipPryce: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Windows
[06:13] <edd_> whats dispatcher?
[06:13] <noclue> mschoolbus how do i do it then??
[06:13] <PhilipPryce> strabes: already tried that, i dount
[06:13] <Moelmo> it says i dont have permission to write
[06:14] <Rprp> try sudo ?
[06:14] <nastas> syn-ack:yes but how?
[06:14] <PhilipPryce> strabes: i dont understand how you get the server name and share name
[06:14] <Cyberai> could anyone tell me what the terminal command is to launch the "Windows Wireless Drivers" utility? I'm on a fedora box ssh'd into my ubuntu box.
[06:14] <mschoolbus> noclue: do a google search for "wine programname" or "cedega gamename"
[06:14] <budluva> Moelmo, the psp says you dont have permission or ubuntu?
[06:14] <Moelmo> at first it used to work fine... but suddenly it stopped working
[06:14] <edd_> zntneo: whats network manager dispatcher?
[06:14] <mschoolbus> just see if others have got it to work before you waste your time
[06:15] <zntneo> edd_: you might need it   might be from when i was using fedora
[06:15] <edd_> ok
[06:15] <VigoFusion> claudi1:A235 Connextant?
[06:15] <Moelmo> @budluva: wanna talk in query
[06:15] <Moelmo> ?
[06:15] <Cyberai> could anyone tell me what the terminal command is to launch the "Windows Wireless Drivers" utility? I'm on a fedora box ssh'd into my ubuntu box.
[06:15] <claudi1> VigoFusion.....yes
[06:15] <noclue> how do i make a cd install through wine??
[06:16] <budluva> Moelmo, actually come to think of it, i dont think i've ever tried to transfer in linux
[06:16] <budluva> Moelmo, i always transferred from my XP laptop
[06:16] <nastas> syn-ack:???
[06:16] <Cyberai> noclue, cd to the directory of the setup.exe and run it with "wine setup.exe"
[06:16] <febuiles> noclue: run under a console: wine Setup.exe where Setup.exe is the installation executable
[06:17] <g333k_work> Hi, how can I do to boot just in console mode?
[06:17] <Dybber> Why does firefox's file viewer (You know, when there are a "Browse.." button) show hidden folders and files?

[06:18] <zntneo> edd_: i wish i could get mine working now
[06:18] <alleyoopster> Hi, a quick question. Can anyone tell me if the Thinkpad T23 has a touchpad or other? I know this is not really an Ubuntu question, but ... thanks
[06:18] <syn-ack> nastas: What?
[06:18] <g333k_work> febuiles, is nothing to do with the innitab file?
[06:18] <Cyberai> could anyone go to their system administration menu and get the options on the windows wireless driver setup utility? I need to know what the comand line is to launch it
[06:18] <PhilipPryce> can someone help me mount my windows share over a network?
[06:19] <nastas> syn-ackhow?
[06:19] <febuiles> g333k_work: Im sorry, misread your question

[06:19] <nastas> syn-ack: how can i scan the hdd?
[06:19] <JaxDomino> how can i connect to my Windows XP laptop from Ubuntu?
[06:19] <syn-ack> nastas: Read the manual that comes with your AV app. I cant know everything, dude.
[06:19] <JaxDomino> file system
[06:19] <PhilipPryce> can someone help me mount my windows share over a network?
[06:19] <nastas> ok! thnx anyway
[06:20] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce, doubel click your network icon on yourdesktop, it should show up in your windows network there
[06:20] <Rprp> How can i configure my ati driver?
[06:20] <g333k_work> !nodm
[06:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nodm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:21] <g333k_work> What's the console runlevel of ubuntu?
[06:21] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: well, thats all well and good, i click "MSHOME" and then it says its contents cant be displayed, but if i go to the IP address of it i can access it
[06:21] <febuiles> g333k_work:  3
[06:21] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: but i need to mount it so i can listen songs from it
[06:21] <Cyberai> PillipPryce - define "access it" when you go by IP
[06:21] <g333k_work> febuiles, So it will be enough if I put this runlevel in the innittab?
[06:22] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: i surf to smb://192.168.1.102 (internal ip) to connect to it
[06:22] <febuiles> g333k_work: yes
[06:22] <febuiles> id:3.blablabla
[06:22] <efox> where can i find a description on the latest linux image. ive been looking everywhere
[06:22] <g333k_work> febuiles, So 5 is the graphic runlevel right?
[06:22] <febuiles> yes sir
[06:22] <s0nix> anyone here is using VMWare Server with a physical disk/partition......... on a scsi hard disk? :|
[06:22] <claudi1> Vigo... i don't want to loose my hopes  :(
[06:23] <efox> 2.6.15.27 is what im looking for
[06:23] <Cyberai> PhilliPryce - in a terminal type in "man mount" and look at the options concerning fstype. You should be able to use that to construct a "mount -t smbfs <mount location> <place on your hd to mount it>" command
[06:23] <febuiles> Has anyone tried to install 6.10 on a Macbook?
[06:23] <VigoFusion> claudi1: EEP! looks like a tuff one,,I keep looking,
[06:24] <Rprp> How can i configure my ati driver?
[06:24] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: i've tried that, it required me to link to //SERVER/share but i dont have that information, i only have my ip
=== VisualStation is now known as VisualStation|TI
[06:24] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce, what did you name your PC in Windows?
[06:24] <claudi1> VigoFusion....but i don't need to install my modem...my modem is working in ubuntu...i have to create a connection !!!!!!!!!!!
[06:24] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: PRYCEHOME
[06:25] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: try //iptoyourpc/C where C is your share
[06:25] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce, what did you name the share?
[06:25] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: what is my share though, this is the part i dont understand
[06:25] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce, the share is what you set up as a shared folder in windows
[06:25] <claudi1> VigoFusion...so don't look for a235 drivers for linux....cause i've just downloaded thos ones
[06:26] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce, did you right click on a folder in windows and then set it up as a shared folder?
[06:26] <noclue> #winehq
[06:26] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: ok
[06:26] <hangfire> I read in the ubuntu website that ubuntu automatically detects any ATI card below 9600. So I put in my 9250 and the screen was totally black, not even the bootup text scrolled. What could be wrong?
[06:27] <Cyberai> hangfire, pull out the card and re-seat it frst of all. If that doesn't work , test it in another PC.
[06:27] <hangfire> ok, thanks Cyberai
[06:27] <Cyberai> hangfire, sounds like a dead card if neither works.
[06:27] <Cyberai> could anyone go to their system administration menu and get the options on the windows wireless driver setup utility? I need to know what the comand line is to launch it
[06:27] <hangfire> Cyberai- Yeah, I have a feeling I might have killed it with static discharge
[06:28] <PhilipPryce> Cyberai: yes, i've shared serveral folders.
[06:28] <scena> IS anyone here familiar with Ubuntu BIND9 and Windows systems?
[06:28] <davehun> hi i am having some problems building ffmpeg with mp3 support
[06:29] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: When you set a shared folder you set a name for it, thats the name you have to use in the share part of the mount command.
[06:29] <Cyberai> PhillipPryce - then the command usage would be //PRYCEHOME/<folder name>
[06:29] <hangfire> Cyberai- what would that be under in the Administration menu?
[06:29] <davehun> i have export export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="risky" and then built the package
[06:29] <Lynoure> scena: with bind9 and with ubuntu, and with windows systems, but not together. What problem do you have?

[06:30] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Did you use the exact name of the computer on the mount or the IP?
[06:30] <scena> Lynoure: I'm running BIND9 on my Ubuntu 6.06.1LTS station. I've got other Ubuntu boxes taht use it & DNS works fine. However, if I have any Windows box try to query it I get either time outs or non existant domains.

[06:31] <Lynoure> scena: what command are you using on windows to query? Have you doublechecked the windows machines query your dns servers?
[06:31] <PhilipPryce> i have the CMD line open in windows with ipconfig ran, with the ip showing and the share name of my pc on display
[06:31] <green_earz> np
[06:31] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: yep, nether work
[06:31] <Lynoure> scena: I assume you are using   dig  in ubuntu to test dns?
[06:31] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Can you ping the windows machine from the other one?
[06:31] <scena> Lynoure: I do: nslookup "machine name" ex: nslookup herbie.sjc-net.com
[06:31] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: //PRYCEHOME/My Music and //192.168.1.102/My Music

[06:34] <dsnyders> Last night my root filesystem went read only.  Now I can't boot.  I am getting buffer I/O errors.
[06:34] <Lynoure> scena: whois claims the domain does not exist.
[06:34] <scena> Lynoure: if I perform the look up from any Ubuntu/Linux box I get what I expect. But if I try it from Windows, it fails. The only thing I can think of is I only have a forward zone. Do I need the reverse as well?
[06:34] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Can you paste the error from mount?
[06:34] <Fri13> Hi.....
[06:34] <Lynoure> scena: you were trying some local fake domain setup?
[06:34] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Ok, have fun then.
[06:34] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: huh?
[06:34] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Oh, sorry :D
[06:34] <scena> lynoure: yes. its all local. its an internal network only. its not exposed to the outside world.

[06:35] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Thought it worked now :d
[06:35] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: the commandline mount or file browser error?

[06:36] <frafra> I'm trying to install ubuntu edgy on a powerbook g4
[06:36] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: ip or PRYCEHOME or w/e the computer name was
[06:36] <scena> lynoure: no. experimenting with Ubuntu in server roles here at work.
[06:36] <efox> whenever i get all the updates, i end up getting a new kernel image...and grub keeps a list of all them
[06:37] <frafra> it says that it can't found any new word partition

[06:38] <dsnyders> frafra, did the powerbook have an OS on it previously?
[06:38] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: i suppose you want to see what i spews out right?
[06:38] <zim> hi all how can i push a file using ftp from bash in a script ie: localfile=foobar.tar send to ftp.foobar.com user=foo pass=bar
[06:38] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Does it show your "My Music" share there?
[06:38] <frafra> dsnyders: yes, macosx 10.4
[06:38] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: yes
[06:39] <g333k_work> Does gdm start in runlevel 3?
[06:39] <Lynoure> scena: my wild guess would be that the windows machines are checking with toplevel name servers about  sjc-net.com and then give up as they get "does not exist" for it, but I do not know how to change it.

[06:40] <craigbass1976> Ok, can anyone help me with the kernel panic I'm getting during the boot from livecd?
[06:40] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Can you post the exact error you're getting (as long as its shorter than 2 lines)
[06:41] <Lynoure> scena: I told you there does not seem to be sjc-net.com, or at least whois says so, so if .com is asked about it, those name servers will also say it does not exist
[06:41] <frafra> dsnyders: yes
[06:41] <Lynoure> scena: not a problem you,d have with a real domain
[06:41] <scena> Lynoure: its a private domain. so why wouldnt the first DNS server which holds the sjc-net.com domain return it?
[06:41] <PhilipPryce> Cannot find "//PRYCEHOME/SharedDocs/". Please check the spelling and try again.
[06:41] <dsnyders> frafra, do you have any unpartitoned space on your hard drive?

[06:42] <g333k_work> Does gdm start in runlevel 3?
[06:42] <claudi1> :(
[06:42] <claudi1> VigoFusion....maybe i should install the firmware
[06:42] <cyzie> g333k_work, u can check in /etc/inittab
[06:42] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: Can you try this command: "smbmount //PRYCEHOME/SharedDocs /mnt/<yourmountpoint> -o username=<youruser>"
[06:43] <Lynoure> scena: I can poke around a bit if you tell me what the nameserver is
[06:43] <g333k_work> Can somebody help me to configure my PC to boot just in runlevel 3, without unistalling gdm?

[06:43] <cosmodad> does anyone know an application in Ubuntu that can record audio streams from the net (or basically just any audio running through my sound card)?
[06:43] <dsnyders> frafra, can you give us the exact error message?

[06:44] <craigbass1976> I shut acpi off because I read that might help, but still no love
[06:44] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: should it exist or not?
[06:44] <highneko> I have some things on both sides of my panels, and I can't get rid of them. There's no option for this in the properties. They're not the hide arrow things. I found nothing in gconf-editor, but I could have missed it.
[06:44] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: yes, what mount command where you using then?
[06:44] <green_earz> zim: you could use sftp in the bash script. on the remote machine put your ssh key on it. you can ssh up so that it will not ask for a password
[06:44] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: so, /mnt/windows should exist?
[06:44] <zim> hi all how can i push a file using ftp from bash in a script ie: localfile=foobar.tar send to ftp.foobar.com user=foo pass=bar
[06:44] <febuiles> PhilipPryce: yes
[06:45] <Jaak_> i am really stuck, the documentation on getting a windows sys in grub list is very short,  grub just won;t load it
[06:45] <PhilipPryce> febuiles: well it doesnt, not before i run the command atleast
[06:45] <cyzie> g333k_work, check in /etc/inittab

[06:52] <Cyril_> hi
[06:52] <Jaak_> wine doesn't emulate windows
[06:53] <febuiles> 1) Wine is really not an emulator but a set of implemented APIs. 2) What is exactly your problem

[06:54] <Dekkard> actually.. i think i prefer vim
[06:54] <Drac|School> The fact that your distro is failing to compile what other distros see as a toy isn't helping.

[07:42] <ubitux> jeff2, yes it reconfigure Xorg... that's why you need to do a backup of the /etc/X11/xorg.conf in case of troubles. Only for the mouse... maybe take a look with : apt-cache search mouse
[07:42] <kyootoo> soundray: Yes and yes.
[07:43] <aiesecer> anyone plz
[07:43] <aiesecer> !!

[07:43] <rasemmi> same prob with kanotix, there it can be fixed by "modprobe 8250". 8250 is not included with ubuntu.

[07:48] <thevenin> ubuntu is a very good distro for beginners
[07:48] <AnthonyG> mwalling: It's easier if you are familiar with DOS. Or cmd lines in general.
[07:48] <huibert> aiesecer: classic form off a wrong X config.

[07:57] <Doow> AnthonyG: not that I know if I can help you, but what's the problem?
[07:58] <soundray> Rorviker: 'cat /etc/lsb-release' is another way to access that info

[08:01] <thevenin> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or something like that
[08:02] <pettern> kyootoo: same happends to me sometimes. then its usually becaus it somehow switches to another soundcard

[08:07] <soundray> AnthonyG: how is it connected?
[08:07] <dtrask> njal: how come?
[08:07] <AnthonyG> soundray: The card , Or cable? Card is in PCI slot

[08:15] <Delkster> Doow, the release of 6.06 (which would have been 6.04 without the delay) was just delayed to polish it a little more.
[08:15] <ataq> YoG: WEP 64 or 128? My experience is Ubuntu dont like connecting to 128, 64/48 is best
[08:15] <BigWop> I just wish I had someone to help me set up something nice
[08:15] <Doow> Delkster: polish is good
[08:15] <Delkster> But they didn't want the delay to carry on to the next release, hence the shorter period between the releases
[08:15] <pettern> njal: there is no blacklist command
[08:16] <AnthonyG> soundray: I re-searched the lspci string , It came up with a recent slackware forum posts , The user said ltmodem worked.

[08:20] <greg> Anyone know about any issues with Ubuntu & Serpentine, specifically writing audio discs and recieving a "Success" dialog, but not actually writing to the CD?  I.E., putting the newly burned disc back in the player and seeing it read as a "Blank Disc"......... Just wondering.....
[08:20] <YoG> ataq: wep is on now.
[08:20] <ataq> YoG: and your saying no ping, so obviously no web pages working?
[08:21] <Doow> sysrage: upgrade is for normal upgrade, dselect-upgrade is something used by a special package-tool called dselect and dist-upgrade is used when upgrade to a new version of the OS (ie Dapper Drake to Edgy Eft)
[08:21] <YoG> ataq: didn't try, but i guess no web pages
[08:22] <ataq> YoG: ok, ubuntu says its connected but its not, set wep to 48/64 bit

[08:46] <HumanPrototype> tonyyarusso, good - and have u tried running it as root rather than using sudo
[08:47] <tonyyarusso> HumanPrototype: It has to be run from a root term, ie. sudo -i, plain sudo fails.

[09:02] <YoG> ataq: I'll check the card again on XP (it worked there before I started the whole thing)...
[09:02] <HumanPrototype> tonyyarusso, i wonder if you could run it as www-data - would that work?
[09:02] <malakhi> HumanPrototype, tonyyarusso: had to check real quick, but sh scripts will complete w/o notifying of failures.
[09:02] <tonyyarusso> HumanPrototype: Perhaps
[09:03] <YoG> ataq: ubuntu: 6.06
[09:03] <tonyyarusso> malakhi: What are the implications of that then?
[09:03] <EDinNY> is there a non-kde printer config tool?
[09:03] <ataq> YoG: cant see why its not working
[09:03] <tonyyarusso> HumanPrototype: I'll try it anyway
[09:03] <HumanPrototype> malakhi, thanks, thats great - so if it has 3 lines and the second line fails it will still run line 1 and 3?
[09:03] <malakhi> tonyyarusso, basically it will look like a success, w/o actually doing anything.
[09:03] <Pie-rate> EDinNY: I have a pretty new ACER laptop, however it gives some PCI errors while booting the unbuntu installer and freezes, I think flashing the bios will fix it but I dont know how to do it.

[09:04] <HumanPrototype> Pie-rate, I have the acer aspire 5102
[09:04] <malakhi> tonyyarusso, running it as www-data would be my suggestion. Don't know if that will fix things though.

[09:06] <WhiteRabit> MAN scp is slow!
[09:07] <WhiteRabit> oh well... if it works
[09:07] <WhiteRabit> noone can reccomend a good nfs client for windows?
[09:07] <EDinNY> trilly, if you compile all the necessary modules to boot you don't need and initrd...not easy with these big kernels
[09:07] <Pie-rate> you haven't seen slow until you've seen acer.com...

[09:08] <malakhi> WhiteRabit, I looked for a decent Windows NFS client some months ago, w/o much success. Most are proprietary, and everyone I spoke with said they all sucked.

[09:18] <MitchM> dfcarney, so I want to start this process under "init"
[09:19] <MitchM> dfcarney, or another user
[09:19] <dfcarney> MitchM: you may be able to use a double-fork to keep the process alive
[09:19] <YoG__> ataq: I don't know either... but i hope I won't do it again
[09:19] <MitchM> dfcarney, so there are no options to make this a "process" from cli?
[09:19] <jerp> cbx have you gone into the firefox preferences that handles files
[09:19] <MitchM> dfcarney, such as && or so.
[09:19] <dfcarney> MitchM: i.e. invoke another instance of a shell within a shell, and then call the process
[09:20] <MitchM> dfcarney, oh -- i know you can do that. But there has to be an easier way =)

[09:22] <Miles> or?

[09:23] <gh0st> anyone using eclipse?
[09:23] <jerp> miles you will probably have to go into the mbr eventually if you don't know how to enter the bios

[09:23] <lumpki> learninglinux, how much ram do you have?
[09:23] <jerp> look forward to that
[09:23] <jerp> :)
[09:23] <malakhi> learninglinux, depends on how much ram you have, etc. Ideally something like 150-200% of your ram.
[09:23] <learninglinux> what if you make it bigger then that?
[09:23] <MitchM> dfcarney, ah -- but that's lame. I want to be able to type <command> {add something here} and get it to run under init (or daemonize it)
[09:23] <Miles> Dont I just go back to bios and choose other boot option to get back to xp?
[09:23] <learninglinux> i have 256 in this box i made it 1gb
[09:23] <lumpki> then it's wasted space
[09:24] <dfcarney> learninglinux: there's not much benefit.
[09:24] <malakhi> learninglinux, it's wasted space
[09:24] <MitchM> dfcarney, for any program =)
[09:24] <learninglinux> ah kewl thanks

[09:33] <LjL> Fobia: does your computer completely ignore the presence of the CD (i.e. just goes on booting Windows), or does it try and fail?

[09:37] <killown> I want get kde 4 in ubuntu
[09:38] <Alzi2> Chewy954: Linux doesn't need drivers. It has everything built into it. So, if it doesn't work, something's wrong with either Hardware detection or your kernel. Try mounting /dev/fb0 to /media/floppy (don't forget to create that folder)
[09:38] <LjL> killown: where exactly does it say that you need to download kubuntu?
[09:38] <MitchM> AnthonyG, No piggy-backing me for the coffee run :)

[09:39] <malakhi> killown, why do you want KDE4 in the first place? It's still highly experimental. In other words, barely usable...

[09:45] <Rprp> Can someone help me? If im gamen the sounds are coming 3 / 4 seconds later, how can i fix that?
[09:45] <LjL> gbrent: isn't /var/www assigned to the www-data group by default?
[09:45] <rsl> LjL, When you say traversing you're talking about code going through each filename? I'm writing an application for a server and don't really traverse the folders in that sense but I do seek out the files by name. Would that be affected?
[09:46] <LjL> Minty: ... by... doing it and seeing if it does?
[09:46] <gbrent> LjL: nope.. it looks like root owns and it is the root group
[09:46] <Minty> LjL, what I mean is that I am sure I have a problme with the reseau and I would like to see the text mode at booting to see if I have OK or failed
[09:47] <gbrent> LjL: what do you normaly see for an owner of the www directory?
[09:47] <LjL> rsl: going through each filename, yes - that, or something a bit smarter, must be done by the system everytime you refer to a file by name. i think ext3 really does just go through each filename, but i'm not really sure. how many files are we talking about anyway?
[09:47] <Xal2> I attempted to reinstall Grub, but I installed it on the wrong drive (an NTFS drive) and now it appears to be empty, and needs to be formated. I installed it to the partition rather than the MBR on accident in an ubuntu shell. Is there any way to get my data ack?

[09:48] <gbrent> Xal2: data recover software
[09:48] <LjL> gbrent: heh... well, my /var/www is owned by www-data:www-data  -  however, it was owned by those even before (re)installing apache. but i don't think i've ever touched the ownership manually, so i guess it was apache's installation that set it like that in the first place
[09:49] <Xal2> What did I do to the drive when i wrote grub to it like that?
[09:49] <LjL> gbrent: is it apache that you're using?

[10:00] <i7ch> MarcN, any luck?
[10:00] <LjL> gravyface: also, you should use $( ... ) instead of ` ... ` , since the latter is deprecated. doesn't really make a difference right now though (but the former is also more readable ;)
[10:00] <zylche> scroll wheel ... on a keyboard?! That's madness!
[10:00] <rsl> LjL, Thanks for your help.
[10:01] <eobanb> as far as i know, if X doesnt find a usable configuration, it falls back to the last known good configuration when you ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:01] <livingdaylight> i7ch: au contraire, 1024x768 is the resolution i want
[10:01] <MarcN> i7ch: you missed it: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34835/
[10:01] <i7ch> MarcN, oh thanks!
[10:01] <livingdaylight> can someone help me edit my xorg.conf file?
[10:01] <zylche> livingdaylight, video card?
[10:01] <livingdaylight> i want to know how to uncomment or take out the unwanted screen resolutions
[10:01] <LjL> livingdaylight: unless you're compelled to do otherwise, use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" rather than editing it directly
[10:01] <peshalto> if i install ubuntu on an ide drive, does it have a bootloader that will let me also choose to sometimes boot into another OS that's on a SATA drive?
[10:01] <LjL> livingdaylight: can do that through dpkg-reconfigure
[10:02] <zylche> just leave them, they aren't harming the computer.
[10:02] <livingdaylight> LjL, oh...i thought editing xorg.conf file was the way to do it
[10:02] <i7ch> MarcN, hmm, i tried something like that and it didn't work. i don't think my touchpad is on /dev/psaux. rather on /dev/input/mice0. but that doesn't work either.
[10:02] <LjL> livingdaylight, that dpkg-reconfigure *will* result in modifying xorg.conf - you're just not doing that directly
[10:02] <gbrent> LjL: I added myself to the www-data group and it still would not let me make a dir under www. The perms are set to 775 on www. I, the owner is www-data and the group is www-data
[10:03] <peshalto> damn, why do I always ask the hard questions
[10:03] <livingdaylight> LjL: so what the difference and why do you recommend your method. I know it takes me through all kinds of difficult questions
[10:03] <tuxtux> ciao a tutti
[10:03] <MarcN> i7ch: I have both /dev/psaux and three of the /dev/input/mouseN
[10:03] <malakhi> peshalto, short answer is yes.
[10:04] <brianski> wtf... it looks like my isp has my wifi router capped at Mb/s
[10:04] <brianski> 6Mb/s
[10:04] <peshalto> malakhi: heh, I wonder what the long answer is
[10:04] <livingdaylight> LjL: does that work command work in Kubuntu too?
[10:04] <silya> when I run command `sudo apt-get install dhcpd` message appears E: "Can't find package dhcpd"
[10:04] <LjL> livingdaylight, because if you modify it manually, the next time you run dpkg-reconfigure on it, your modifications will be overwritten. and the questions aren't really difficult, since you don't need to answer any of them - just press Enter. the defaults are what you already have in your current xorg.conf (unless you changed it manually previously, maybe)
[10:04] <brianski> maybe i can try a different channel, but that sure explains why connecting to another host on my wireless lan is piss slow
[10:04] <gbrent> LjL: I also did a cat on /etc/group and I am apart of the www-data group
[10:04] <i7ch> MarcN, welllllll. let me try that again, then, with your configuration.
[10:05] <brianski> i7ch: that make sense to you, since you knew what i was looking for beforer :) ?
[10:05] <Tixer> hey
[10:05] <Tixer> how do you change the Gnome icon in the top corner
[10:05] <MarcN> i7ch: output of lsmod: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34836/
[10:05] <livingdaylight> LjL: ok, thx for explaining it to me. Does that command work in kubuntu too?
[10:05] <thevenin> man my noodles are to runny
[10:05] <zspada15> what a pain in the royal rear end to get the wireless working
[10:05] <zspada15> hey thevenin
[10:05] <livingdaylight> LjL: i'm torn between kubuntu and ubuntu...
[10:05] <thevenin> hello zspada15, is there something i can help you with
[10:06] <Tixer> how do you change the Gnome icon in the top corner
[10:06] <EdLin> livingdaylight: you can install all the programs from both you know....
[10:06] <zspada15> thevenin: nope, i fixed it, took me two hours, i ended up just getting wifi radar
[10:06] <thevenin> livingdaylight: you can have both gnome and KDE
[10:06] <Tixer> My Gnome Icon is the feet, and I wanna change it back
[10:06] <thevenin> nice
[10:06] <zspada15> the probelem was the DHCP client
[10:06] <livingdaylight> thevenin: huh, explain
[10:06] <thevenin> that is good to hear though, sorry i could not lend more help
[10:06] <livingdaylight> EdLin: are you yanking my chain?
[10:06] <Tixer> no
[10:06] <thevenin> i dont know exactly how to do it, but my friends does it
[10:07] <EdLin> livingdaylight: aptitude install kubuntu-desktop in ubuntu, or vice versa
[10:07] <thevenin> i only need gnome
[10:07] <Hexidigital> can someone help me with a script that if eth2 goes down, the system reboots?  i am having lots of problems with that USB interface
[10:07] <zspada15> wifi radar broadcasts to 192.168.1.1, default sudo dhclient broadcasts to 255.255.255.255
[10:07] <silya> So, why ubuntu server installed from box can't find dhcpd package?
[10:07] <i7ch> is there any quick way to see if /dev/psaux represents my touchpad?
[10:07] <thevenin> ah, well that is good you got it working
[10:07] <Tixer> can anyone help with my problem?
[10:07] <zspada15> !ubuntu wiki| livingdaylight
[10:07] <livingdaylight> thevenin: gnome is way inferior, you know it. but gnome looks nice that is also true

[10:08] <LjL> livingdaylight: works in both, yes
[10:08] <thevenin> i do more work from terminal and SSH tunnels then anything
[10:08] <ubitux> i7ch, do a cat on, do something with the touchpad and analyse
[10:08] <Tixer> how do you change the Gnome icon in the top corner
[10:08] <zspada15> thevenin: same here, i prefer GNOME, but im almost exclusively a cli junkie
[10:08] <Tixer> My Gnome Icon is the feet, and I wanna change it back
[10:08] <dcordes> how can i forward the xserver of a remotely connected ssh server to my own box?

[10:08] <badboybot> Welcome maynoth
[10:08] <EdLin> then run multiple terminal windows :-)
[10:08] <sgorilla80> whats the best way to set up printers in gnome?
[10:08] <LjL> gbrent: you need to use "newgrp" (man it) to set your primary group to www-data, at least i think that's the best approach
[10:08] <zspada15> someone wanna get rid of this bot?
[10:08] <thevenin> you can do things quicker and easier from terminal

[10:09] <HumanPrototype> hi all
[10:09] <thevenin> why is it here, and whos is it
[10:09] <Hexidigital> any operators here? badboybot is a bot (just like the name implies)
[10:10] <LjL> gbrent: i don't think... admin lets you use sudo, that's all basically. normally, your primary group is your user's group (you know, normally each user has a group with the same name as the user)
[10:10] <zspada15> livingdaylight: are you on dapper? edgy?
[10:10] <HumanPrototype> what is the best dvd burning program for gnome that supports burning videos?
[10:10] <Tixer> can anyone help with my problem?
[10:10] <thevenin> badboybot: is getting ignored
[10:10] <zspada15> Tixer: what is your problem?
[10:10] <livingdaylight> zspada15: edgy

[10:10] <Hexidigital> for kicking the bot

[10:11] <Tixer> ...
[10:11] <thevenin> the ubuntu GUI is straight forward
[10:11] <maynoth> I am really impressed with ubuntu
[10:11] <i7ch> MarcN, don't really know what to do with that information.
[10:11] <thevenin> yes it is good, i am really impressed with ubuntu 6.06 server
[10:12] <maynoth> I just got Nerolinux 2.1.0.3 running
[10:12] <Doow> Ignore badboybot
[10:12] <Doow> oops
[10:12] <marlun> Can I access my windows computer over the network from Ubuntu?
[10:12] <zspada15> Tixer: if you want to change the image its in /usr/shared AFAIK
[10:12] <zspada15> marlun: yes
[10:12] <LjL> Doow: it's long gone
[10:12] <XiXaQ> maynoth, I've been using ubuntu for about a year and I'm still impressed :) I discover new goodies all the time
[10:12] <marlun> zspada15, how?
[10:12] <maynoth> this is a very very usable system
[10:12] <i7ch> MarcN, sudo cat /dev/psaux and then fiddling with the touchpad doesn't show anything.
[10:12] <maynoth> I mean
[10:12] <thevenin> marlun: how VPN, telnet, shared folders?
[10:12] <maynoth> like
[10:12] <zspada15> marlun: are you on edgy? dapper?
[10:12] <maynoth> really usable
[10:12] <brianski> i7ch: no cat into it
[10:12] <maynoth> I am suprised
[10:12] <marlun> zspada15, I'm on edgy.
[10:12] <maynoth> utorrent works perfect under wine
[10:12] <brianski> cat /dev/random | sudo tee /dev/psaux >/dev/null
[10:12] <maynoth> automatix is great too
[10:12] <Doow> LjL: =)
[10:12] <brianski> see if your mouse goes apeshit or not
[10:12] <LjL> !automatix | maynoth
[10:12] <ubotu> maynoth: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[10:12] <ikke81> yes utorrent very good
[10:13] <marlun> thevenin, zspada15, I would like to access some fodlers I've shared on windows, can I access them from Ubuntu (Edgy)
[10:13] <ikke81> better than azureus
[10:13] <zspada15> marlun: here is the info about it, if you need help understanding, feel free to ask in here: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Samba_Server
[10:13] <maynoth> well it works

[10:13] <thevenin> marlun: yes
[10:13] <XiXaQ> !worksforme
[10:13] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.

[10:13] <zspada15> thevenin: lol sorry
[10:14] <marlun> thevenin, zspada15, do I have to use Samba to access the folders I've shared on windows?
[10:14] <baconbacon> marlun: no

[10:14] <thevenin> marlun: check out ubuntuguide.org
[10:14] <baconbacon> marlun: smbclient is in default ubuntu
[10:14] <maynoth> I am installing freemind right now
[10:14] <LjL> maynoth: has pointed out, it worked *for you* - for many others, it broke their systems badly. that's why we don't recommend it at all
[10:14] <oem> Hi, just installed Edgy, my 1st linux. Very simple question:
[10:14] <oem> I'm creating a new user and give going to select "Administrator" -profile for it. I just want to make sure it does not have same rights as root.
[10:14] <thevenin> it explains it pretty detailed on how to do it both ways
[10:14] <maynoth> wish me luck
[10:14] <brianski> oem - it basically does
[10:15] <baconbacon> oem, do you wish your new account to be admin or not?
[10:15] <MarcN> i7ch: for me, /dev/psaux dumps the USB mouse data, but not the touchpad.
[10:15] <brianski> any member of the admin group can use sudo freely
[10:15] <oem> should I be Desktop user?
[10:15] <pumpkinhead> someone suggest a public NNTP server?
[10:15] <marlun> thevenin, ok, will do :)
[10:15] <oem> I want to use sudo.

[10:15] <marlun> baconbacon, ok, thanks
[10:15] <baconbacon> oem, sudo = admin rights
[10:16] <MarcN> i7ch: do you have [kpsmoused]  running?
[10:16] <we2by> any one got hibernate working?
[10:16] <lumpki> oem, the first user you created, when you installed, has sudo priviledges
[10:16] <i7ch> MarcN, yeah
[10:16] <i7ch> MarcN, not that i know what it is, but it shows up in ps aux
[10:16] <justin_> How do I get M3U's and such to default to XMMS?
[10:16] <maynoth> I know nothing about linux... I am amazed at how simple it was to set up all my programs
[10:17] <oem> so if i uncheck "Administer system" from priviledges, I'm unable to sudo? right?
[10:17] <maynoth> now if wine development could just pick up and make all my windows programs work
[10:17] <maynoth> LOL
[10:17] <justin_> maynoth: Perhaps your a genius and you never knew it :o
[10:17] <i7ch> MarcN, there are more details here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1823396#post1823396
[10:17] <baconbacon> oem, yes
[10:17] <MarcN> i7ch: I *dont* have synaptics-usb loaded fwiw
[10:17] <maynoth> lol my grandma could set up ubuntu
[10:17] <maynoth> hehe
[10:17] <Doow> maynoth: it's probably be the other way around with vista just around the corner
[10:17] <maynoth> I am really impressed
[10:17] <maynoth> eww vista
[10:17] <maynoth> to heck with that
[10:17] <Doow> maynoth: =)
[10:17] <maynoth> thats why I am trying to get used to ubuntu
[10:18] <thevenin> vista is very underwhelming to be quite honost
[10:18] <maynoth> vista was my main motivation for wanting to use linux
[10:18] <i7ch> i thought it was very nice, visually
[10:18] <maynoth> I dont understand tho
[10:18] <MarcN> i7ch: what laptop?
[10:18] <justin_> Vista.. is an excuse to upgrade hardware.
[10:18] <maynoth> all the contreversy behind including binary drivers with ubuntu
[10:18] <justin_> Basically like all new windows.
[10:18] <thevenin> visually yes, but eye candy does get work done, just takes resources
[10:18] <i7ch> MarcN, Asus Z96F
[10:18] <maynoth> why doesn't mark just have a script to download and install them post installation
[10:18] <Doow> maynoth: just saying that compability between wine and windows will probably be worse once vista is out, it's always the best just before every new release of windows
[10:19] <baconbacon> maynoth: downlading them might be the problem
[10:19] <maynoth> well yeah... but wouldn't that be a better option than actually including them with ubuntu
[10:19] <justin_> thevenin: Eye candy gets work done?
[10:19] <baconbacon> maynoth: like, how to download wireless network drivers?
[10:19] <MarcN> i7ch: fwiw, /dev/input/mouse2 is the mouse nub -- this hp/compaq nc6000 has the mouse nub near keys GHB, a touchpad and I have a usb mouse plugged in.
[10:19] <justin_> thevenin: nice oxymoron :P
[10:19] <thevenin> lol
[10:20] <thevenin> thank you, lol
[10:20] <i7ch> MarcN, nub? GHB?
[10:20] <maynoth> ooh
[10:20] <maynoth> i see
[10:20] <alecjw> escputil (epson util) says that i need to use a raw device, hwat does that mean? what is it?
[10:20] <maynoth> well i dunno
[10:20] <MarcN> i7ch: er, actually today is isn't a usb mouse, a old style plugged into the docking station.  My wife has the usb mouse today.
[10:20] <i7ch> MarcN, oh, i see what you mean by GHB
[10:20] <maynoth> well 99% of the ppl i know have ethernet cards also

[10:22] <ere> anyone using ubuntu in a large scale? like 200+ computers. I'm interested to hear how you maintain them.
[10:22] <maynoth> I think in 5 years ubuntu will be better than vista/macos
[10:22] <AnthonyG> Ubuntu is already better
[10:22] <i7ch> MarcN, well, i'm close to giving up.
[10:22] <maynoth> well
[10:22] <maynoth> yeah
[10:22] <AnthonyG> IBM refuses to support Vista XD
[10:22] <maynoth> I agree in a lot of respects
[10:23] <Doow> AnthonyG: seriously? got a link?
[10:23] <maynoth> but it just keeps getting better each new release
[10:23] <baconbacon> lets keep it a support channel

[10:23] <AnthonyG> Not at the moment , Google for it.
[10:23] <Doow> baconbacon: sorry

[10:23] <AnthonyG> Apologies baconbacon :)
[10:23] <ere> AnthonyG: Ubuntu is very nice, but still there are some problems, particularly with drivers like video/wireless/acpi on laptops. I administer 100 laptops and 120 desktops with ubuntu. It is still a pain to get all the hardware working properly.

[10:26] <Lynoure> ere: I was just about to say same as MarcN. No matter what the OS or distro, if you have gazillion of different hardware, you will have unnecessary hassle. If your computers have known hardware, you can pretty much clone the installations. Are you doing that to some degree?

[10:32] <zntneo> zspada15: why?
[10:32] <LacunaV> Does anyone know what module in linux-restricted-modules could be making my wireless led work? It's hard to isolate

[10:33] <zntneo> theres no -a option
[10:34] <alecjw> escputil (epson util) says that i need to use a raw device, what does that mean? what is it?
[10:34] <ere> Lynoure: I have not tried SystemImager. I have not really considered anything else than g4u. I started to use it as it alredy was in use at work when I started  a few months ago. I will check out SystemImager

[10:34] <baconbacon> marlun: go in the properties of an mp3 file, theres a tab to associate mp3 with another app
[10:34] <[DK] Seth> Ok - i only have sata disks in my computer - a unpartitioned 160 GB ready for Ubuntu. But when i chose the first option from the boot menu it gets stuck at "Mounting file system". Is there a chance that it dont load sata drivers? In any case how do i fix this?
[10:34] <jumble> hurray, there's people in here.
[10:34] <FlyingSquirrel32> zspada15: I already tried that.
[10:34] <zspada15> zntneo, ok just "lspci | grep Broadcom"

[10:35] <ReinH> Does anyone have a favorite gdk/kde terminal app? besides gnome terminal
[10:35] <zntneo> zspada15: yes
[10:35] <marlun> baconbacon, I also found how how to use smb://ip/sharedfolder, but i don't seem to be able to play mp3 files directly from there, I had to copy a mp3 file to my home directory and then play it, then it worked.
[10:36] <zspada15> zntneo, do you have wired internet access to the machine?
[10:36] <alecjw> ReinH: i like gnome-terminal, but xterms also ok - nice an light
[10:36] <zntneo> not right now
[10:36] <jumble> i'm trying to run the live ubuntu 6.10 cd for the first time and i get an error message "Failed to start the x server... it is likely that it is not set up correctly" - is this a common problem with an easy fix? im having trouble finding the solution (mostly since i don't really get the whole system and how it works)
[10:36] <ReinH> alecjw: I like light :)
[10:36] <baconbacon> marlun, gnomevfs is sometimes not quite as transparent as windows net drives / folders. Sorry

[10:38] <AnnonZi> I plan to install Ubuntu on a friend's computer.  I have used SUSE Linux quite a bit, but have only installed Ubuntu once.  He only really plans to surf the Internet, and look at images/pictures (online and from a thumb drive).  Is there anything I should install after I put Ubuntu on his computer to make sure everything will work correctly, like Java (as I'm not sure what Ubuntu comes with after a clean install).
[10:39] <zspada15> zntneo, trust me, i just did this today with the exact same card, it is a royal pain in the ass unless you get it right
[10:39] <thevenin> AnnonZi: i would say shockwave and java just for the webpages
[10:39] <thevenin> but thats it
[10:39] <AnthonyG> AnnonZi: Tell him He'll have quite a time setting up the networking portion if he has a modem :D
[10:39] <axisys> !ldap
[10:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ldap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:39] <Rottis-> baconbacon, any developers there?
[10:39] <AnthonyG> There is no shockwave for Linux.
[10:39] <AnnonZi> I think he has DSL, but I
[10:39] <AnnonZi> 'm not sure.
[10:39] <AnnonZi> Will have to look today.
[10:40] <axisys> how do i ldap search from terminal against my ldap server? where do i get a ldapclient?
[10:40] <thevenin> oh well that is good to know
[10:40] <|rt|> AnnonZi: flash9 beta, mplayer-plugin, win32codecs are the things that come to my mind
[10:40] <AnnonZi> So just Java and Shockwave?  It comes with OpenOffice, right?
[10:40] <AnthonyG> No
[10:40] <jumble> sorry to ask again, but... i'm trying to run the live ubuntu 6.10 cd for the first time and i get an error message "Failed to start the x server... it is likely that it is not set up correctly." i have no idea what the problem or where to begin looking... any advice?
[10:40] <AnthonyG> There is no ShockWave for Linux
[10:40] <StarQuake> where can i get flashplugin beta?
[10:40] <StarQuake> seveas doesn't seem to have it anymore
[10:40] <zspada15> zntneo, are you identified through nickserv on freenode?
[10:40] <hydroxyl> Can someone convert this hex to PCI:0.0.0 format, 01:0e.0 ?
[10:41] <AnnonZi> But it comes with OpenOffice?  Because he'll be view .doc files.
[10:41] <Miles> my cd intergrity failed
[10:41] <Miles> any help?
[10:41] <fuffal0> im trying to install ubuntu on a new system and it hangs up after selecting install/run ubuntu (from the 6.06 cd) at "mounting root filesystem" - it just sits there
[10:42] <|rt|> AnnonZi: yes it comes with OO.org
[10:42] <Igor_V2> what's the chm viewer for ubuntu?
[10:42] <Doow> jumble: there could be a number of reasons for that error, type "tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log" in a console
[10:42] <Miles> o rite
[10:42] <hydroxyl> Can someone convert this hex to PCI:0.0.0 format, 01:0e.0 ?
[10:42] <jumble> how do i get to the console?
[10:42] <hydroxyl> PCI:0:0:0 **
[10:42] <AnnonZi> And all the other stuff can be obtained through the package program that comes with it (the name escapes me).

[10:42] <|rt|> AnnonZi: you may also want to install Gaim if he needs to do any IM
[10:43] <AnnonZi> Ah, forgot about GAIM.
[10:43] <baconbacon> hydroxyl: e is 14
[10:43] <Doow> jumble if X didn't start you should be there when you log in (text-based interface)
[10:43] <AnnonZi> Will probably do that also.
[10:43] <hydroxyl> baconbacon: Thank you.
[10:43] <AnthonyG> jumble: Boot into recovery mode , Linux at it's best
[10:43] <Doow> jumble: oh, the live-cd
[10:43] <Doow> jumble: then I'm not sure
[10:43] <we2by> azureus crashed again! :(
[10:43] <Doow> jumble: I don't know how it handles logs
[10:43] <AnnonZi> Java, Flash 9 Beta, MPlayer-Plugin, Win32Codecs, and Gaim?
[10:43] <AnthonyG> Oh no :(
[10:44] <Igor_V2> anybody knows whats the .chm viewer for Ubuntu?
[10:44] <jumble> should i use alternate install instead? this is really just a nightmare, al lthe documentation i can find is totally opaque.
[10:44] <AnthonyG> Win32Codecs?
[10:44] <AnnonZi> Someone mentioned it.
[10:44] <AnthonyG> Win32=Windows
[10:44] <AnthonyG> 32 Bit Windows
[10:44] <AnnonZi> Yes, I understand.
[10:44] <jumble> "recovery mode" doesn't seem to be an option listed when im at the live cd boot menu.
[10:44] <zspada15> zntneo, are you still there?
[10:44] <AnnonZi> Probably the video codecs?
[10:44] <AnthonyG> Windows!=Linux

[10:45] <Doow> jumble: you could do that I guess, otoh it's hard to know if you will get X running afterwards if we don't know what the reason for the live cd failing is
[10:45] <[DK] Seth> fuffal0: i have the same error -- do you have sata disks?

[10:46] <zntneo> who was it that was helping me?
[10:46] <SpyKiller> can anyone help me?
[10:46] <jumble> so i was able to look into some log which was long and kind of opaque but im fairly certain that it said something about not being able to locate a screen device.
[10:46] <AnthonyG> SpyKiller: A bit hard to help without a problem :D
[10:46] <SpyKiller> :)
[10:46] <SpyKiller> so

[10:49] <AnthonyG> jumble: All commands for Bash :D
[10:49] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: im searching for a sulution -- anyway for SCSI there is a special boot parameter listen in the F1 help under F7 i think Selected Disk Boot Parameters but unfortunately there isn't any for SATA (my problem)
[10:49] <jumble> what is bash?
[10:49] <zntneo> ere: its working doing it that way. Are you saying i can't use network manager?
[10:49] <ben1756> jumple: Bourne Again SHell
[10:49] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: im running SATA too and the problem properbly is that the Ubunto install CD dont load any SATA drivers
[10:49] <zntneo> I'm using the wireless right now
[10:49] <ben1756> jumble: Bourne Again SHell
[10:50] <Doow> jumble: think of it as the textbased interface
[10:50] <zntneo> although it seems touchy
[10:50] <jumble> got it. thanks.
[10:50] <AnthonyG> jumble: It's a layer to interface with the shell.
[10:50] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: do you run sucessfully Ubuntu on your SATA drives?
[10:50] <peshalto> [DK] Seth: so if the install CD doesn't load them, does that mean there is another way to load them after the install?
[10:50] <ere> zntneo: It is just important to make sure the card work in the first place.

[10:51] <TheCham1> it worked fine
[10:51] <peshalto> jumble: do a local install in your user directory
[10:52] <zntneo> i better get off my laptop almost out of battery
[10:52] <maynoth> hey I have a solution for everyones wifi problems
[10:52] <AnthonyG> Is the above compatible with the current kernel?
[10:52] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: i think that it need a special parameter to boot and "Mount Root File System" if you're running SATA disks
[10:52] <jumble> i tried, somehow we couldn't get it to work. i walked through it with the system admins and we gave up.
[10:52] <maynoth> I use a wifi to ethernet bridge
[10:52] <zspada15_> its a pain in the ass with wifi
[10:52] <peshalto> jumble: i mean install the perl modules you need in your own home directory
[10:52] <maynoth> its external
[10:52] <zspada15_> i got the wifi to work though
[10:52] <maynoth> but it works great
[10:52] <fuffal0> [DK] Seth - i need to give it a special boot paramater for my scsi's
[10:52] <fuffal0> ?

[10:53] <zspada15_> maynoth, are you on BCM4318?
[10:53] <jumble> peshalto, i got it. i still dont know why the process didnt work, and neither did they. unfortunately.
[10:53] <peshalto> TheCham1: so do you know anything about this special parameter [DK] Seth is mentioning?

[10:55] <AnthonyG> Hello
[10:55] <st3v3n_r0y> how can i change themes via recovary mode?
[10:55] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: i dont see a problem in that cause Ubuntu clearly have SATA drivers built in the system but perhaps not in the installer which is my problem
[10:55] <peshalto> [DK] Seth: ideally I'd also like to be able to choose at boot time to boot into another OS that is on the SATA drive..
[10:56] <st3v3n_r0y> coz i installed a worng themes and its wont start ubuntu up
[10:56] <jumble> ok i'm running the boot process now and here is the specific server output.

[10:56] <dv_> I want to see if ubuntu supports its NIC?
[10:56] <jumble> it says "(EE) No devices detected,     Fatal server error: no screens found"
[10:56] <st3v3n_r0y> how ?
[10:56] <marlun> how can I move the content in a folder to another folder, I don't want to move the folder but just it's content.
[10:56] <st3v3n_r0y> Anatoly how ?
[10:56] <[DK] Seth> peshalto: its not a problem once you have installed Ubuntu unto your IDE drive -- just chose one of the two boot managers Ubuntu comes with
[10:56] <AnthonyG> sudo apt-get install erm
[10:56] <AnthonyG> What was the package name?

[10:59] <AnthonyG> http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/smartlink/Ubuntu/ , Which one of these tarballs shall I use with the latest kernel ?
[10:59] <grimboy> So I have a box under the desk(TM) that I want to start up rtorrent from when it's switched on. I'll use screen and attach it when necessary. Point is, how do I hook in a script at startup (not login). Do I have to use init/upstart? Because that seems like overkill to just start rtorrent running.
[10:59] <st3v3n_r0y> Gh0sty if i reinstall gnome . is every settinng gonna change or what?

[11:01] <maynoth> sorry
[11:01] <njal> dreamerhxc: It's curious, i had it working when i used dapper last, and got it working in edgy, but now since edgy just isn't so good with stuff i need and i need the binary drivers :S
[11:01] <st3v3n_r0y> noting is there :D
[11:01] <Aphonik> can anyone help? im trying to install 6.06.1 and when i click install it hangs on "adding live CD user"
[11:01] <DreamerHxC> I neved had them working
[11:01] <st3v3n_r0y> Thank you everyone . windows s0cks . ubuntu is the best
[11:01] <st3v3n_r0y>  :D
[11:01] <Gh0sty> maynoth: yes it will
[11:01] <AnthonyG> Don't get too far ahead of yourself
[11:01] <craigbass1976> I've got the dapper drake (I think it's called that) livecd and I'm booted into it right now.  I'm trying to get a canon bjc 2000 running, but after I've set it up and apply the changes, all that's in the printer window is still "new Printer"
[11:02] <njal> dreamhxc: Where do you get stuck?
[11:02] <maynoth> what about a new monitor
[11:02] <AnthonyG> Windows is still useful at times
[11:02] <maynoth> I am about to switch to an LCD
[11:02] <maynoth> on my ubuntu box
[11:02] <Oni-Dracula|2> does anyone know of a program that will completely obliterate files from the hard drive?
[11:02] <maynoth> what do I need to do to make it autodected my new monitor
[11:02] <ink251> any ideas on: "cat: /dev/parport0: Invalid argument"
[11:02] <craigbass1976> Oni-Dracula|2: I think there's a utility called shred
[11:02] <grimboy> AnthonyG, What, like if you want to play a game?
[11:02] <Gh0sty> maynoth: if its the same size no prob, otherwise you have to reconfigure xserver maybe (which is not a big deal)
[11:02] <asakalli_> can anyone help me on installing ipw3945 drivers for wlan0
[11:02] <jumble> ok sorry i disappeared for a second, i was copying the contents of the error messages from the Live CD boot. so this is what it says...

[11:03] <LordMiles> I didnt burn the cd
[11:03] <fuffal0> i'm back, still freezing up at the "mounting root filesystem" - i've got scsi drives if that's of any importance .. do i need to pass a boot command of some kind to tell it i'm using scsi?
[11:03] <AnthonyG> grimboy: There's one reason
[11:03] <LordMiles> its version 5.1 i got in the post

[11:03] <Aphonik> can anyone help? im trying to install 6.06.1 and when i click install it hangs on "adding live CD user"
[11:03] <Gh0sty> or have a look at the wikis
[11:03] <asakalli_> i had it
[11:03] <Gh0sty> proly will be one about that too
[11:03] <grimboy> AnthonyG, Design apps is the other. Apart from that I find it hard to think of anything else.
[11:03] <FlyingSquirrel32> Where do I go to formally request a server install configuration (like the LAMP setup)
[11:03] <asakalli_> Gh0sty: but i have problem on installation
[11:03] <LordMiles> I keep getting cd intergrity fails on a live cd of 5.1 i got in the post a few months ago
[11:04] <Gh0sty> LordMiles: bad cd or bad cdrom drive
[11:04] <grimboy> FlyingSquirrel32, Uhh, could you rephrase?
[11:04] <asakalli_> where i can paste my problems
[11:04] <cidco> hi all

[11:05] <AnthonyG> Yes
[11:05] <cidco> I am getting it when i play DVDs, i havent been able to come up with anything on google
[11:05] <AnthonyG> Not enough system resources.
[11:05] <craigbass1976> Man, there's a lot of traffic in here...  Can anyone tell me why hitting the apply button after setting up a new printer doesn't make it show up in the printers window?
[11:05] <AnthonyG> More than likely lack of memory
[11:05] <FlyingSquirrel32> Well, the server CD has 2 configurations that can be selected when your're installing, Vanilla and LAMP. I heard they are thinking of creating more of these configurations, and I'd like to formally request one.
[11:05] <grimboy> Aphonik, Try the alternative install.

[11:06] <maynoth> Ghosty how do you reconfigure xserver?

[11:07] <grimboy> FlyingSquirrel32, Cool, I'm sure the launchpad, the wiki and the forums is where they discuss these things. If you're serious then have a look in all of them and put your proposal where it seems more appropriate (or in all of them).

[11:11] <jumble> are there any other linux distributions that are as user friendly as ubuntu? it looks like getting this install to work isnt going to happen in the near future...
[11:11] <EmperorCezar> So, over in my lug channel we were having a discussion. Why isn't openssh-server installed by default? Not turned on by default, just not installed.
[11:11] <AnthonyG> jumble: Gentoo is the most user friendly in this earth :D
[11:11] <Oni-Dracula> is sourceforge down?
[11:11] <owh> Hi all, I'm doing some launchpad translations in Rosetta and came across a string that talks about Debian with Debian examples. While I understand the origin of Ubuntu, should those strings be translated with Ubuntu and the examples modified? Is there a policy, where is the policy, etc :-)
[11:12] <pianoboy3333> Is there any pi function in the math module?
[11:12] <Flibberdy> AnthonyG: I use gentoo. I love gentoo. but you're absolutely nuts
[11:12] <jumble> "most user friendly in this earth" sounds like the sort of thing im looking for.
[11:12] <pianoboy3333> ah, there is, nm
[11:12] <grimboy> pianoboy3333, #perl or #python or something for those questions mate.
[11:12] <craigbass1976> How do you fire up the printer gui from a command line?
[11:13] <jumble> ok i found myproblem on some forum somewhere and it says the solution is "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati" but it doesnt say anything about what im supposed to do with those two commands or where im supposed to type them.
[11:13] <Bearcat> hello all. I'm not new to linux, but i am new to ubuntu and enjoying it muchly. I'm trying to add a repository so i can get murrine. According to this page:   http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=239378 i need to know wether i have edgy or dapper. How can i tell? I have a 64-bit installation for what that matters.

[11:14] <Chewy954> whats ubuntu edgy?
[11:14] <craigbass1976> bimberi: AHH why can't root run that command?  "Can't open display"
[11:14] <Bearcat> ahh, i just found the about, that tells me i have dapper
[11:14] <Doow> jumble try pressing ctrl-alt-F2 (ctrl-alt-F7 takes you back)
[11:14] <grimboy> pianoboy3333, What was odd? Me?
[11:15] <jumble> doow: thanks! what was i looking at and what am i looking at now?
[11:15] <bimberi> craigbass1976: is it a root shell while logged into a normal user?  won't work.  try 'gksudo gnome-cups-manager' from a user shell
[11:15] <fuffal0> i'm back, still freezing up at the "mounting root filesystem" - i've got scsi drives if that's of any importance .. do i need to pass a boot command of some kind to tell it i'm using scsi?
[11:15] <Doow> jumble now you're look at the shell/command-line/bash
[11:15] <bimberi> craigbass1976: although I note that it runs as the normal user here
[11:15] <Doow> jumble: I hope =)
[11:16] <craigbass1976> bimberi: Yeah, I did sudo and it worked, but I had the same problem.
[11:16] <Chewy954> any1?
[11:16] <Chewy954> whats ubuntu edgy?
[11:16] <Doow> jumble: before you were looking at what should be X/gnome but failed

[11:16] <Chewy954> oh ok
[11:16] <Chewy954> i wasnt sure if its the same thing as the desktop iso
[11:16] <Chewy954> im downloading it now

[11:16] <Chewy954> gonna switch over from Blag to Ubuntu
[11:17] <jokester> hi, i need some help configuring networkmanager. I use ndiswrapper might that be the pb ?
[11:17] <Doow> jumble: if you need more than one
[11:17] <jumble> damnit, the fix didnt work. it said the solution was to type "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati" and i get a message "xserver-xorg-video-ati" is already the newest version
[11:17] <jumble> probably one is plenty.
[11:17] <Doow> jumble: you never know =)

[11:19] <craigbass1976> bimberi: cups error log says  CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer: Unauthorized
[11:19] <LjL> Lars_G: i don't know of a --force option to do that. what i tend to do is edit the pre/post script manually and just add an "exit 0" as the first line. quite obviously, that's totally not recommended, dangerous etc (but then using --force options has the same caveats)
[11:19] <Chewy954> about how long does it take for ubuntu to install?
[11:20] <Chewy954> on a 2.0ghz cpu and 256mb ram pc
[11:20] <bimberi> craigbass1976: are you in the lpadmin group?
[11:20] <Chewy954> blag took 15 minutes, so dunno if i should install it tonight
[11:20] <Lars_G> LjL: I'll think about it. thanks
[11:20] <craigbass1976> bimberi: I'm running the livecd to make sure things work before installing.
[11:20] <LjL> Lars_G: is that an official package anyway?
[11:20] <craigbass1976> bimberi: I'm ubuntu
[11:21] <jumble> what does 6.10 have that 6.06 doesn't? anything important/substantial?
[11:21] <Lars_G> LjL: Neine, no sense reporting a bug. though it seems to fail on stuff created by semi-offitial packages
[11:21] <bimberi> craigbass1976: does the output of 'groups' include lpadmin
[11:21] <bimberi> ?

[11:25] <craigbass1976> bimberi: I'm not on edgy.
[11:25] <craigbass1976> bimberi: dapper something or other.  I think 6.06?
[11:25] <kitche> njal: stop gdm from starting then do sudo nvidia-xconfig and then your X should be set up if you already installed nvidia-glx
[11:25] <njal> am curious since i should install nvidia-glx and then change the driver from vesa to nvidia and it shoudl, just work
[11:25] <TrioTorus> _david_: yes, just choose not te create new partitions and don't choose to format any existing partition
[11:25] <jumble> doow, any ideas from the log link?
[11:25] <LjL> craigbass1976: Dapper Drake is 6.06, yes. Edgy Eft is 6.10
[11:26] <bimberi> craigbass1976: got one of them (and a 2nd PC).  Stand by...
[11:26] <njal> kitche: If i set the driver to anything other than vesa gdm don't start, but installing nvidia-glx and setting the driver and installing any restricted modules packages does not work
[11:26] <Doow> jumble: Only thing I can see is that it can't find your graphics card, can't really say why

[11:27] <Doow> jumble: post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf too
[11:27] <kitche> njal: did you try sudo nvidia-xconfig and see if that works?
[11:28] <njal> kitche: I have at one point already today
[11:28] <Doow> jumble:  then there's some command you can do to dump your pci info, but I don't remember it
[11:28] <Doow> so someone will have to help us =)
[11:28] <njal> kitche: All it does is just change from vesa to nvidia anyway, so me doing it manually shouldn't make any difference
[11:28] <bimberi> craigbass1976: ... a fairly slow 2nd PC ... :)
[11:28] <TrioTorus> Doow:  lspci?
[11:29] <jumble> right. how do i view the contents of my /etc/x11/xorg.conf?
[11:29] <Spee_Der> Doow: in terminal mode 'sudo hwinfo'
[11:29] <craigbass1976> bimberi: :)
[11:29] <whyameye> I have a reiserfs disk and mount is hanging when i try to mount it. The disk is damaged. Any way I might repair?
[11:29] <Spee_Der> jumble:
[11:29] <kitche> njal: but did you restart gdm if you stopped it
[11:29] <Spee_Der> jumble: in terminal mode do the following
[11:29] <zylche> can anyone help me get sound working on here again? :P
[11:29] <Doow> Spee_Der: command not found
[11:29] <Spee_Der> jumble: 1st. cd /etc/X11
[11:29] <LjL> Adam_G: that's been asked more than once. i don't know, and i can't check because i don't have gnome. perhaps try this: start a non-Gnome X session (like, the "failsafe" session), and launch gnome-panel manually using "strace -e trace=file gnome-panel". that should spew a lot of information about files that gnome-panel is accessing - see what it access when you hit Quit/Suspend
[11:29] <DeepThoughts> Are there any *.debs of linuxdc++ available?
[11:29] <njal> kitche: Yes, i know if i change the X config i need to restart X
[11:30] <Spee_Der> Doow: in terminal mode, 'sudo apt-get install hwinfo'
[11:30] <Stormx2> Yo. GNOME Screenshot can't take screenshots of the focused window. Any software which can? :) thanks
[11:30] <njal> kitche: It's weird, it's not behaving like the i expect it should...
[11:30] <JNeverMind> the ftp user can only access /home/ftpuser/ how can i let them download a file residing /over/here.file
[11:30] <Doow> Spee_Der: =)
[11:30] <Spee_Der> jumble: Once in the X11 directory, do dir
[11:30] <Adam_G> LjL- thanks so much! I'll try that now and add it to the wiki if I find out
[11:30] <Spee_Der> jumble: to be sure there is a file named xorg.conf
[11:30] <Spee_Der> jumble: Let me know when you find it
[11:30] <jumble> there is
[11:31] <Spee_Der> ok
[11:31] <Spee_Der> jumble: do you also have a file named xorg.conf.backup ?
[11:31] <jumble> this article seems to be related to my problem, although im having trouble parsing it - http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/23/137206
[11:31] <jumble> no
[11:31] <Red_Death> Hey guys
[11:31] <w30> Stormx2, good ole' xv can do that nicely.
[11:32] <Red_Death> where can I find a guide from upgrading from 5.10 to 6.10?
[11:32] <Spee_Der> jumble: ok. in terminal to make a backup of the xorg.conf, do this -->>  sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup
[11:32] <JNeverMind> ive used ln -s before but not sure if it applies here
[11:32] <RichiWish> afternoon evryone
[11:32] <Spee_Der> jumble: then do a dir to be sure it has now the copy of the file
[11:32] <w30> Stormx2, it should be in Synaptic
[11:32] <Stormx2> w30: xv. Okay, thanks
[11:32] <jumble> done
[11:32] <Spee_Der> ok
[11:32] <Stormx2> w30: Easy to use?
[11:32] <Spee_Der> jumble: Now the fun part.....
[11:32] <Red_Death> where can I find a guide from upgrading from 5.10 to 6.10?
[11:33] <Stormx2> holycow!
[11:33] <_david_> I have another question.... can I make the install skip installing grub?
[11:33] <bimberi> craigbass1976: OK.  I get exactly the same error here.  Looks like a bug - but only with the LiveCD.
[11:33] <kitche> Red_Death: well you really should upgrade to dapper before you upgrade to edgy
[11:33] <w30> Stormx2, its not free as in GNU free but its free as in beer
[11:33] <Spee_Der> jumble: In terminal mode, sudo gedit xorg.conf, this will open the editor for the xorg.conf text file so you can inspect andd/or edit and then save......
[11:33] <holycow> hellow
[11:33] <Stormx2> w30: ah okay
[11:33] <njal> Red_Death sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and find+replace the dist name with dapper
[11:33] <Red_Death> kitche: When I say 5.10 to 6.10, I mean that and any steps inbetween, so a guide to dapper then edgy would be nice as well
[11:33] <jumble> i get a message that says "cannot open display"
[11:34] <Spee_Der> jumble: Once you have made changes and saved the file, then you do not have to restart the computer......
[11:34] <RichiWish> I am having a problem installing a Lexmark All-in-One ...can anyone help?...I'm new to Linux
[11:34] <Red_Death> njal: alright, i'll let you know when that's done
[11:34] <Spee_Der> jumble: You then need to use the 'ctrl+alt+backspace to restart the X.
[11:34] <Red_Death> njal: right now I'm updating it from the install to the current stuff, all I had was this old cd so I threw it in
[11:34] <Spee_Der> Be careful wht you type in there jumble, look at the format carefully.
[11:34] <jumble> i thought the whole point was that the X doesnt work...?
[11:34] <mo^> hi @ all. i need help! i tried to resize a partition via the gparted live cd. at the end an error occured. now i can't boot my system anymore. in the gparted live cd all my disk is shown as not parted... please help me! :(
[11:35] <Spee_Der> jumble: I just got tuned in here, just home from work. What is your OS please ? Ubuntu ?
[11:35] <craigbass1976> bimberi: not with install?
=== zntneo__ is now known as zntneo
[11:35] <rockprincess> good evening all! i know this is not just a troubleshooting channel...but i desperately need some help in configuring my java :(
[11:35] <zntneo> can anyone help me figure out why my bcm43xx wireless card is being so dang flaky?
[11:36] <jumble> yeah,ubuntu 6.10. sorry. the problem is that the x doesnt boot up. something with my video card and not being able to find the screen. the log is here - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34844/
[11:36] <bimberi> craigbass1976: I've done lots of printing from my dapper installs :)
[11:36] <maynoth> question
[11:36] <njal> kitche: Any ideas? I'm kinda despirate to get my machine off vesa
=== ok67_ is now known as ok67
[11:36] <maynoth> is there anyway to make ubuntu automatically install updates
[11:36] <maynoth> without any user confirmation
[11:36] <LjL> Adam_G: sorry, i've had to reboot - any luck?
[11:36] <zntneo> anyone?
[11:37] <kitche> njal: so you shutdown X completely even gdm? when you changed your xorg.conf
[11:37] <AnthonyG> For the sake of all mercy.... O
[11:37] <Spee_Der> jumble: Ok, I will look in a bit, I am not Edgy smart (yet). Also kinda busy as I just  got in and am preparing for dinner etc.... Bear with us on this....
[11:37] <maynoth> I am going to get the output for shareaza 2.2.1.0 which doesn't crash
[11:37] <w30> Stormx2, its a quick and dirty graphics program, lacking in modern ability to work on super large graphic files but it does a lot of the color editing and resizing like gimp but without the overhead of gimp.
[11:37] <njal> kitche: Yup i did a hard reboot for good measure
[11:37] <jumble> ok, thanks for your help spee. i appreciate it.
[11:37] <AnthonyG> For the sake of all mercy.... ... Really , It's a modem
[11:37] <Stormx2> w30: Ah okay.
[11:38] <LjL> AnthonyG: a *win*modem you mean? *grin*
[11:38] <jumble> how would i go about changing the driver in xorg.conf from ATI x600 to radeon x600? i see some indications online that this may fix the problem.
[11:38] <kitche> njal: do glxinfo and see what it says for your driver
[11:39] <w30> Stormx2, its great for taking a large digital camera file and making it a 70kb or so web foto or resizing or re-aspecting etc.
[11:39] <Stormx2> w30: bleh cool :) I hate The GIMP
[11:39] <Rumpanzle> Q: how do I format a dvd-ram. I tried mke2fs, but afterwards it's not recognised anymore. Is there an easy was to just format something under linux?
[11:40] <Pie-rate> I need help with a really seemingly complex install problem
[11:40] <Spee_Der> jumble: I forgot how to do that as I didn't write it down, but there is a way to do it through the deb-reconfigure command.
[11:40] <AnthonyG> The martian instructions state to grab a driver tarball that is named according to my kernel version.
[11:40] <w30> Stormx2, but it is not so great for pasting and cutting one photo into another, etc
[11:40] <AnthonyG> I onle see yearmonthday
[11:40] <AnthonyG> In that order
[11:40] <Stormx2> w30: Alright. Thanks for all the help :) Can't talk much tho, coursework.
[11:40] <fuffal0> after letting the ubuntu cd sit at "lounting root filesystem" for about 5 minutes, it finally goes into somesort of shell (where i can barely do anything) with the error: /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off - any ideas?
[11:40] <holycow> "martian instructions"
[11:40] <holycow> hehehe
[11:41] <jumble> well speer, how do i access a text editor that doesnt require X?
[11:41] <bubba> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Contact
[11:41] <zntneo_> this is really pissing me off
[11:41] <AnthonyG> Watch the language
[11:41] <Spee_Der> jumble: What I would try seeing you have a backup xorg.conf file. Delete the xorg.conf, shut down and switch the two cards and re-boot and see if it redoes the xorg.conf
[11:41] <zntneo_> AnthonyG: sorry
[11:41] <jumble> what to cards?
[11:41] <jumble> two cards, rather
[11:41] <njal> kitche: http://pastebin.com/835745
[11:42] <zntneo_> Does anyone in here have a bcm43xx wireless card that works good
[11:42] <Spee_Der> ATI and Radeon ? @ seperate x600's ?

[11:42] <donjuanica> <-- having problems booting from Edgy Eft CD.  Hangs eternally on USB device probing...any ideas?
[11:42] <zntneo_> kitche: what card do you have
[11:42] <jumble> oh. no, i just read that the problem could be fixed by telling it radeon instead of ati. here. http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php?Number=674910
[11:42] <jumble> my card is ati.
[11:42] <Pie-rate> ide: failed opcode was: unknown
[11:42] <njal> zntneo_: I have one, but notice if it's idling the card disconnects itself
[11:42] <Pie-rate> hdb: dma disabled
[11:43] <kitche> zntneo_: a motorola WNPCIG
[11:43] <zntneo_> chipset?
[11:43] <jumble> but i dont know how to open an editor to change xorg.conf without x running
[11:43] <zntneo_> jumble: vi maybe?
[11:43] <njal> jumble: sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:43] <maynoth> anyone here know how to set up ubuntu to automatically install updaes

[11:44] <kitche> njal: don't worry it finally came up
[11:44] <Spee_Der> jumble: In terminal mode after you login with user name and password
[11:44] <zntneo_> the reason i ask is my card works for a while then dies works for a while then dies
[11:44] <Spee_Der> jumble: cd /etc/X11
[11:44] <jumble> woo. thanks njal.
[11:44] <Spee_Der> jumble: sudo gedit xorg.conf
[11:44] <zntneo_> and i have to jump threw hoops to get it working again
[11:44] <TrioTorus> jumble: the livecd is booting fine, but your install is not working?
[11:44] <Pie-rate> running ubuntu 5.04, my USB mouse refuses to move, even after restarting the system
[11:45] <jumble> trio - x isnt booting.
[11:45] <kitche> njal: hmm seems liek you need to edit your xorg.conf more since it's missing the glx module it's probably just commented out
[11:45] <jumble> its choking on my graphics card
[11:45] <RichiWish> can anyone help me install a Lexmark all-in-one on PuppyLinux version 2.11?
[11:45] <zntneo_> anyone know why my wireless card is doing that
[11:45] <jumble> spee, i think gedit doesnt work because x isnt loaded
[11:45] <Pie-rate> it worked before, i unplugged it and then plugged it back in and it no longer works
[11:45] <Spee_Der> time for foodage
[11:45] <njal> section module has     load "glx"
[11:46] <segfault_> zntneo_, what chipset is ur card?
[11:46] <njal> kitche: I presume it's in the modules section that is
[11:46] <zntneo_> like what do i get when i do a plain lspci?
[11:46] <zntneo_> or lspci -n
[11:46] <TrioTorus> jumble, so it really does look like you run into this problem you pointed out: http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/23/137206
[11:46] <kitche> njal: yeah you can do a search for glx and it should find it in there
[11:46] <TrioTorus> jumble:  did you follow that workaround?
[11:46] <njal> kitche: It's enabled, always has been

[11:51] <Rottis-> ramvi, how about reinstalling ubuntu-desktop?
[11:51] <ramvi> Rottis-, it isn't installed..
[11:51] <sfeddy> How do you set the environment variables for LD_LIBRARY_PATH when you start a command ("python wxPyDemo.py") by clicking on a link on the desktop?  The wx library is not on the ordinary path.
[11:51] <nolimitsoya> ramvi, couldnt you just do sudo apt-get remove kde-dev && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop?
[11:51] <jumble> ok, amazingly somthing is working now. i went into xconf and changed the driver from "ati" to "radeon" and now x windows starts
[11:52] <segfault_> kholz, plz paste error in pastebin
[11:52] <kitche> njal: so it doesn't look like this #load glx since according to glxinfo the glx module doesn't get loaded
[11:52] <ramvi> nolimitsoya, if kde-dev is the problem, wouldn't apt-get say that I had to remove it?
[11:52] <Red_Death> njal: alright, I did that, then an update button popped up so I clicked that and it's doing it for me now, but thanks for the lead

[11:58] <RichiWish> how did you get USB to aotu mount to begin with puff?
[11:58] <homero> hello some one can helpme whit beryl? plissss!
[11:58] <segfault_> kholz, :) np
[11:58] <LjL> Adam_G: hm, try with "strace -e trace=process" instead of "file". or just try strace with no option, though that'll really produce a *lot* of output probably
[11:58] <nolimitsoya> !homero | beryl
[11:58] <kitche> njal: that's up to you if you want to run fb or not
[11:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about homero - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:58] <nolimitsoya> !beryl | homero
[11:58] <ubotu> homero: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:58] <LjL> Adam_G: trace=file, i suppose, doesn't trace fork() and exec() calls
[11:58] <hexion> xDD
[11:59] <nolimitsoya> LjL?
[11:59] <Adam_G> LjL, thx, will do. I tried with no -e trace=file, and there was too much :D.
[11:59] <kitche> nolimitsoya: I think beryl-project.org is still down they had a hard drive failure
[11:59] <hexion> I have a problem with /etc/rc.local    since edgy it doesn't work... how can I run a command at boot with root privileges?
[11:59] <LjL> nolimitsoya: i dunno
[11:59] <LinuxHelp> Does anyone know how I can bind a key to launch an application?
[11:59] <LjL> nolimitsoya: i can't seem to find any packages that i have installed that are specifically unicode-related
[11:59] <hexion> LinuxHelp, try with xbindkeys packet
[11:59] <homero> ok
[12:00] <hexion> package.. I mean
[12:00] <jumble> ok one more stupid quesiton. from either x or the command line, how do i reboot?
[12:00] <segfault_> nolimitsoya, kitche there is a mirror for beryll that is up
[12:00] <njal> kitche: BRB then, attempting X server reboot with ALL modules present
[12:00] <nolimitsoya> LjL, ok, thank you anyway :)
[12:00] <nekr0z> puff: yeah but it only seems to list the connections that are established after I run netstat, not the ones that have already been running. And it doesn't allow to track which connections have traffic going right now in real time, does it?
[12:00] <LjL> nolimitsoya: does "apt-cache policy ttf-dejavu" show it as installed? (though i guess it would)
[12:00] <Adam_G> jumble: "sudo shutdown -r now"
[12:00] <yola> ubuntu comes with Xgl right?
[12:00] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes, version 2.7-2
[12:00] <LjL> yola: not by default
[12:00] <kitche> yola: only if you install it
[12:00] <LjL> Ubotu, tell yola about xgl | yola, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:00] <jumble> adam: thanks. how do you do it from x? or do you always need to quit x first and then do that.
[12:00] <puff> nekr0z: That's odd, when I've used netstat in the past it displays connections that already exist.  Did you check netstat's man page?
