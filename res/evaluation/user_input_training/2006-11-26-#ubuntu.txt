[12:01] <profoX`_> sladen: admin says its only 1 server
[12:01] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: "Olympus Digital Wave Player"
[12:01] <sladen> SlimG: if it's  "0x57" or whatever we've seen that before, but I'm not sure of the issue, it maybe an ATI driver issue IIRC.
[12:02] <sladen> profoX`_: so, what happens in you  apt-get install mtr   and then  mtr www.beryl-project.org    how far do the packets get?
[12:03] <alecjw> tonyyarusso, sladen: it might work in wine - try it
[12:03] <saiko> hi, everyone ! is there any way to change/remove already set default gnome-keyring password, the problem is i don't know the current password ?
[12:03] <Willa> is there any reason my unbuntu station only gets 256kbps
[12:03] <Willa> while my windows station gets 600kbps?
[12:03] <budgester> Willa: yup windows make it up
[12:03] <Willa> huh?
[12:03] <profoX`_> sladen: like... nothing...
[12:04] <profoX`_> sladen: actuallythe mtr program kinda stays blank/freezes for some time
[12:04] <profoX`_> no output.. so i guess it's just timing out or something
[12:04] <zen> why do you use ubuntu rather than debian or lets say mandrake?
[12:04] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: Maybe another day for that route - don't have time for Wine fiddling tonight.  If it's recognized by lsusb though, shouldn't I be able to use it natively?
[12:05] <SlimG> sladen: the output doesn't say anything about 0x57
[12:05] <profoX`_> when i do mtr www.google.com I get a GTK window displaying everything..
[12:05] <profoX`_> sladen: and when i wait long enough: Temporary failure in name resolution: Success

[12:07] <Willa> So I saw Casino royale
[12:07] <Willa> I must admit
[12:07] <Willa> That guy did a good job as bond.
[12:07] <russian-dude> aribo, I found menu.lst, but i don't know what exactly do i need to change
[12:07] <sladen> aribo: I'm confused, who is 'he' that cannot find the "sound card"
[12:08] <IndyGUnFreak> wihle i have no probs keeping things family oriented, how many kids are actually in here?
[12:08] <sladen> russian-dude: what are you attempting to achieve?

[12:08] <libolt> has anyone packaged up the Nvidia Cg library for ubuntu-amd64?  I'm running feisty on my system
[12:08] <Willa> and if they were, good parenting could always fix any issue.
[12:08] <kippi> I have a wireless card, installed the drivers using nswrapper and it can see the driver and the card, but i can't connect to the wireless, how can i trouble shot this?
[12:08] <russian-dude> changing GRUB, so i have a choice: Ubuntu or Windows
[12:08] <sladen> libolt: is that part of the Ubuntu drivers?
[12:08] <odla> how do i change my hostname?
[12:08] <sladen> libolt: is that part of the Nvidia drivers?
[12:08] <Willa> kippi, did u setup the card and check it to make it active? under networking
[12:08] <sladen> odla: edit /etc/hostname
[12:09] <saiko> hi, everyone ! is there any way to change/remove already set default gnome-keyring password, the problem is i don't know the current password ?
[12:09] <mofturos> odla: /etc/hostname
[12:09] <kippi> Willa, yep
[12:09] <Lattyware> cafuego_: Works great, thanks!
[12:09] <odla> well that's freakin easy...thanks gusy
[12:09] <libolt> sladen: doesn't appear to be
[12:09] <sladen> saiko: obviously not, that would be a huge security hole
[12:09] <Willa> kippi, and the progress bar just goes, then disapears?
[12:09] <DjViper> guys, how do I sftp a whole dir from one place to another?
[12:09] <cafuego_> Lattyware: excellent :-)   Note you cna pass 'wide' as 2nd option to the script, to encolde to 16:9
[12:09] <saiko> sladen: i have the root password, though
[12:09] <profoX`_> sladen: ...more ideas?
[12:10] <Willa> the freenode #ubuntu chan is out of control.
[12:10] <johnficca> hi does anyone know how to fix the 64 bit usplash problem?
[12:10] <compengi> does ubuntu recognizes nokia mobile phones connected to him through usb?
[12:10] <Willa> kippi: I'd try #ubuntuo on irc.freenode.com (or net)
[12:10] <aribo> just add at the end sometnihg like this

[12:10] <profoX`_> !paste|aribo
[12:10] <ubotu> aribo: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[12:10] <LjL> Ubotu, tell aribo about paste | aribo, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:10] <sladen> saiko: by default, Ubuntu does not enable the 'root' account, encouraging the use of sudo.  Are you on an Ubuntu machine?
[12:10] <russian-dude> aribo: thanks
[12:10] <Willa> !obnoxious commands
[12:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about obnoxious commands - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:11] <LjL> !botabuse | willa
[12:11] <ubotu> willa: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[12:11] <SlimG> sladen: It outputs a bunch of info, doesn't tell me much
[12:11] <Willa> oh my god.
[12:11] <saiko> sladen: i am, this is actually my machine, but by mistake the default gnome-keyring password was set to "something" and i don't know what that "something" is ..
[12:11] <Willa> doesn't look like there are any ops here?
[12:11] <Willa> odd
[12:11] <kippi> Willa, yeah, the bar just goes, how comes irc.freenode.com ?
[12:11] <libolt> nope searching for libCg.so on packages.ubuntu.org produces no packages that contain the library, looks like I have to do a manual install
[12:12] <Willa> more people than bots.
[12:12] <LjL> Willa, well that doesn't mean the bot should be abused even if there are no ops ;-)
[12:12] <dv_> libolt, yep
[12:12] <dv_> Cg is not in the rep
[12:12] <compengi> does ubuntu recognizes nokia mobile phones connected to him through usb?
[12:12] <sladen> compengi: recognise yes---but you will need to use software to communicate.  Eg. if you want to dial-up via the Mobile Phone, then use 'System->Adminstration->Networking'.  To send SMS, try using 'gnokii'
[12:12] <dv_> not even in multiverse
[12:12] <IndyGUnFreak> are there any ops here?
[12:12] <tonyyarusso> sladen: Any more ideas from you?
[12:12] <agent> can the debian rules file run a custom script? if so, how?
[12:12] <IndyGUnFreak> i've never saw someone kicked off this channel.
[12:12] <sladen> libolt: if you think 'libCg' hsould be installed, please file a bug report asking for it
[12:12] <steve> hi
[12:12] <compengi> sladen, i want to access my data on the phone how can this be done
[12:12] <steve> sorry to annoy you guys
[12:12] <steve> but i got a little question
[12:12] <sladen> IndyGUnFreak: there's ops all around.
[12:12] <Willa> steve, this is a help channel.
[12:13] <steve> i just installed ubuntu 6.10 everything seems fine i got a new system with sata drives so i installed it to my sata disk
[12:13] <dv_> sladen, Cg is a software from nvidia
[12:13] <sladen> compengi: what type of 'data' on the phone?
[12:13] <Willa> sladen: none have any @'s
[12:13] <steve> i said in the setup grub should be installed to hd0
[12:13] <dv_> for platform- and API-independent shaders
[12:13] <IndyGUnFreak> ok sladen, i believe you, i'm not one to really step out of line anyways, just curious.
[12:13] <Willa> ircops?
[12:13] <profoX`_> Willa: doesn't mean they can't kick you if you're being annoying :)
[12:13] <libolt> sladen: alright I'll look into it, I probably should file a bug report that the libogre packages shoudl be updated too.  They're way ancient
[12:13] <steve> but when i reboot grub doesn't show up what could be the problem?
[12:13] <steve> anyone has a idea?
[12:13] <sladen> dv_: if you think it should in included in Ubuntu, please file a bug report asking for libcg to be packaged!
[12:13] <dv_> its not open-source, so I guess it may be problematic to put it in a rep
[12:13] <compengi> sladen, my mmc card.... and other stuff
[12:13] <Willa> how is that possible profoX`_?
[12:13] <sladen> compengi: pictures, email, what?
[12:14] <devilsadvocate> steve, do you boot into ubunut?
[12:14] <compengi> sladen, pictures, files....
[12:14] <sladen> compengi: contacts will need 'syncing' using something like Evolution/OpenSync
[12:14] <saiko> maybe someone know how can i just delete the default keyring and make a new one ?
[12:14] <enyc> steve: notice now the fstab and grub.conf use UUID nuwbers so you should be able to connect the hard disk differently... solong as the bios will present the disk as drive 0x80 it can be booted in short
[12:14] <sladen> compengi: files should be accessible over Mass Storage or OBEX-ftp
[12:14] <profoX`_> Willa: freenode policy is just openminded... everyone is equal... OP's don't become @ unless someone is spamming/being annoying/etc
[12:14] <enyc> steve: you could connect via a pata-aadatper or external caddy, depending on the lreevant bios support
=== profoX`_ is now known as profoX`
[12:14] <johnficca> does anyone know how to boot the 32bit ubuntu on a 64 bit PC
[12:14] <devilsadvocate> steve, are you able to boot?
[12:15] <steve> booting into ubuntu is NOT possible
[12:15] <Willa> profoX`_ I'm just curious how you become an op in a chan, when there are NO opped bots.
[12:15] <Willa> or ppl
[12:15] <lupine_85> johnficca: put the 32bit cd in the drive; reboot
[12:15] <enyc> johnficca: you install 32bit ubuntu and it iwll work
[12:15] <steve> but i cna boot windows xp which is on the same disk
[12:15] <steve> perfectly
[12:15] <compengi> sladen, but shouldn't i get like a flash drive when i plug my mobile by usb to the computer?
[12:15] <lupine_85> or create a 32bit chroot and pop in to it
[12:15] <profoX`> Willa: read some docs about IRC / Freenode in particular ;)
[12:15] <Lattyware> Willa: Services
[12:15] <Willa> is this freenode?

[12:15] <Willa> or efnet?
[12:15] <enyc> Konnektion: howeveryou acn create a debootscrap chroot environment in order to run 32bit thing inside the 64bit... another long story ;-)
[12:15] <profoX`> Freenode
[12:15] <Lattyware> The server can do it behind the scenes.
[12:15] <Willa> OHHH
[12:15] <Willa> lol
[12:15] <Willa> I thought I was on efnet lol
[12:15] <sladen> compengi: only if the phone pretends to be USB Mass Storage device.  If not then you will need other software
[12:16] <johnficca> does it slow down running the 32 bit on 64
[12:16] <profoX`> Efnet is evil
[12:16] <Willa> im on efnet downstairs.
[12:16] <lupine_85> j00 n00b!
[12:16] <Willa> yea I know :)

[12:16] <kud0s> How o you get applcation to run at startup as a daemon? For example, the equivilent of windows services?

[12:16] <ma12> Hello everyone - I absolutely have tried everything to get MPlayer to play my mpg, but it keeps giving me "error opening/initializing the selected video out device
[12:16] <steve> no never bootet
[12:17] <steve> it just gets installed
[12:17] <steve> setup says you can reboot the system now
[12:17] <steve> i do so
[12:17] <Willa> ma12 install VLC
[12:17] <johnficca> I tried booting the 32 bit one and it needed the 64 bit one
[12:17] <enyc> ma12: try vlc or xine-ui ;-)
[12:17] <profoX`> ma12: mplayer (in terminal) or gmplayer (graphical interface)
[12:17] <ma12> totem plays it no problem, but I cannot get MPlayer
[12:17] <steve> but ubuntu doesn't boot up
[12:17] <cowen_> hey
[12:17] <steve> just windows xp loads
[12:17] <profoX`> ma12: don't listen to them, mplayer is the best :)
[12:17] <steve> grub doesn't show up
[12:17] <Willa> vlc plays, no problems.
[12:17] <devilsadvocate> steve, sounds like grub never installed too the mbr...
[12:17] <enyc> ma12: this kindh of thing happnes soemntimes.  worth having many player installed theefore ;-)
[12:17] <kud0s> cheers
[12:17] <ma12> I have heard that MPlayer is the best from what I have read, but I cannot get it to play mpg
[12:17] <wceoscar> HEY....  I HAVE A 64processor 3800+ 939.... CAN I GET THE x64 edition??? is it stable?????????
[12:17] <profoX`> ma12: try: mplayer -vo xv videofile.mpg, does that work?
[12:17] <enyc> steve: thrrm grub not installed on MBR of the booting hard disk then?
[12:18] <Willa> ma12: VLC is the best.
[12:18] <LjL> !caps | wceoscar
[12:18] <ubotu> wceoscar: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[12:18] <DjViper> guys, how do I sftp a whole dir from one place to another?
[12:18] <Willa> ma12: did you dl the codecs?
[12:18] <dm> Ok someone help me.. Somehow the icons in my menubar are all now really small and no matter what theme im on, they do not get bigger icon as well as controls theme
[12:18] <enyc> DjViper: using scp -r instead of sftp
[12:18] <skyfaller> hm... has anyone actually gotten GDesklets to work?  I can't seem to get a freaking weather widget
[12:18] <LjL> wceoscar: it's stable enough, but you won't be able to run certain [proprietary]  things such as Flash, the W32 codecs, etc, at least not easily
[12:18] <ma12> yes all codecs are downloaded
[12:18] <DjViper> enyc: ok
[12:18] <Lattyware> mal12: Appears to have the same thing as me
[12:18] <Willa> does mplayer play .img's?
[12:18] <enyc> DjViper: scp -r locatdir remotehost:remotedir   I think
[12:18] <profoX`> Willa, ma12: i don't think codecs are the problem, because it says his video out doesnt work..
[12:18] <steve> devilsadvocate got the same idea, the setup says grub will be installed to hd0 but what is hd0 i mean i got a raid controller in my system with ide disks did grub get installed to one of those now or how to tell the setup to put grub on my sata disk?
[12:18] <Lattyware> Mine does the same.
[12:18] <wceoscar> ok. im using the 32 6.10 edition... am i in good shape?
[12:19] <skyfaller> Is there a better way to get a weather widget than GDesklets?
[12:19] <profoX`> Willa: .img's as in .iso kinda things? you can mount that, and i also think it plays .iso's natively if it are svcd's or dvd's
[12:19] <Lattyware> And no, my first statement did not make any sense whatsoever.
[12:19] <enyc> steve: hrrm  raid
[12:19] <LjL> wceoscar: you should be. 6.06 is supported for longer than 6.10, though
[12:19] <profoX`> ma12: have you tried my command...
[12:19] <enyc> steve: fiiddly.. is the raid something that linux supprorts ?
[12:19] <wceoscar> oh really
[12:19] <Deez> I've downloaded and built the latest xCHM app. Problem is, they funked the version number on it :( An old version in the repo keep trying to update it but that'll be a downgrade! How the hell do I stop the update manager from trying to downgrade the app!?
[12:19] <Lattyware> ma12: I also get the same thing when trying to play .movs.
[12:19] <LjL> !lts | wceoscar
[12:19] <ubotu> wceoscar: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[12:19] <ma12> profoX it worked perfect!
[12:19] <Willa> profoX`: LAME :). VLC plays .img. Just double click on it, plays just like a .mpg or any thing else..
[12:19] <ma12> how do I make that permanent?
[12:19] <wceoscar> ok
[12:20] <profoX`> ma12: well, but you want to use the Graphical mplayer interface, right?
[12:20] <profoX`> like, gmplayer
[12:20] <ma12> yes
[12:20] <steve> enyc atm ubuntu/linux shall not care about the controller card or the raid it shall install to the sata disk which it does fine and put grub on it :=
[12:20] <steve> ;)
[12:20] <enyc> steve: or is this one of those 'fakeraid' things where the bios software and windows-driver is the only tools that actually can read theaid without special setup of 'fakeraid' tolol?
[12:20] <Lattyware> In fact, with anything. I've had this problem before...
[12:20] <profoX`> ma12: try this.. open up gmplayer.. (type gmplayer or open mplayer through the menu)
=== andrew is now known as Keyseir
[12:20] <dm> Ok someone help me.. Somehow the icons in my menubar are all now really small and no matter what theme im on, they do not get bigger icon as well as controls theme
[12:20] <profoX`> ma12: then right click on the mplayer window and choose Preferences
[12:20] <wceoscar> my other problem is that i installed amsn and i want to delet my current profile or edit it... but it doesnt lets me.. i even uninstalled the apps and re installed it a nd nothing???
[12:20] <gpafixit> Hi all .. I just added a fat32 hard drive (for storage) and now I would like it to show up on my desktop (like the xp partition does) when I login .. I added it to /etc/fstab and mount -a mounted it and I can use it, but I would like it to auto load on my desktop .. how-to?
[12:21] <profoX`> ma12: then go to the "Video" tab... can you tell me which driver is selected?
[12:21] <steve> and it's a raid card but the raid isn't used only disks plugged to the card to use them....
[12:21] <Pelo> dm  try resizing the panel itself
[12:21] <enyc> steve: fine, but you need to get BIOS at boot time to represent that sata disk at 0x80 in the INT 13 function calls and run that bootsector... and this deens to be the case when grub was installed in order for it to have setup in the right place ;-)
[12:21] <steve> as the new board doesn't have ide channels
[12:21] <ma12> profox ok hold on
[12:21] <devilsadvocate> wceoscar, you'll have to remove the profile files i guess
[12:21] <kippi> I have a wireless card, installed the drivers using nswrapper and it can see the driver and the card, but i can't connect to the wireless, how can i trouble shot this? It just gives me the bar saying getting IP address and then the bar just goes and then there is no connection
[12:21] <wceoscar> how can i do that?
[12:21] <dm> Pelo its the items in the menubar, not the panel
[12:21] <Deez> I've downloaded and built the latest xCHM app. Problem is, they funked the version number on it :( An old version in the repo keep trying to update it but that'll be a downgrade! How the hell do I stop the update manager from trying to downgrade the app!?
[12:21] <Willa> kippi have you rebooted?
[12:21] <enyc> steve: the raid card may take over INT 13 in its BIOS and make ithe raid 0x80 etc. and you may not boot from the sata drive therfore?
[12:21] <kippi> Willa, yep
[12:22] <steve> i boot from the sata drive
[12:22] <steve> cause windows xp is installed to it in a partition
[12:22] <Deez> I locked and forced the version in Synaptic *but* that don't mean a thing! please help!
[12:22] <wceoscar> How o i remove the prfile files?? where are they located?
[12:22] <dm> Pelo any suggestions ?
[12:22] <enyc> steve: well if grub does not appear at all then it is not installed on the MBR of that drive ;-)
[12:22] <Pelo> dm,  no
[12:23] <devilsadvocate> wceoscar, try in ~/.amsn/
[12:23] <steve> right
[12:23] <steve> and how do i tell grub to install to that drive now?

[12:24] <skyfaller> hey folks, I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with Ubuntu's package of GDesklets... can somebody help me check this?
[12:24] <Deez> yo! how do I stop Synaptic from trying to update an application!?!?
[12:24] <enyc> steve: then "grub" "root (hd0,?)" "setup (hd0)" where ? depends on the partition the  /boot/grub.menu.list  resides-in
[12:24] <nolimitsoya> could anyone tell me what program you use for tagging and renaming audio files?
[12:24] <enyc> steve: from a root-probmpt (or "sudo grub"
[12:25] <enyc> )
[12:25] <wceoscar> in muy hdd i guess
[12:25] <Pelo> nolimitsoya,  easytag,   but there are a couple in the Add/remove menu
[12:25] <kmarius> nolimitsoya, easytag is good... maybe amarok, too
[12:25] <steve> ok thx
[12:25] <steve> will try this
[12:25] <Willa> oh
[12:26] <Willa> are dvds only 4gigs?
[12:26] <kippi> hmm, I think this is the only place ubuntu is a let down and that's with wireless
[12:26] <Lattyware> yeah
[12:26] <dv_> no,
[12:26] <Lattyware> dual layer are 8
[12:26] <Deez> how the **** do I stop synaptic, system-update or wtf from trying to update an application!?
[12:26] <Lattyware> Well, ish.
[12:26] <Lattyware> 4.7 or somthing.
[12:26] <nolimitsoya> kmarius, Pelo, tried easytag, but it seems to make a mess of things... changing tags of files ive never asked it to. am i doing something wrong?
[12:26] <Music_Shuffle> Single-layer standard DVD's are 4.7.
[12:26] <dv_> I saw 7 gb data on dvds already
[12:26] <Pelo> Willa,  4.7 gig, but you can buy 8 gig ones,  realy expensive
[12:26] <Willa> kippi: try ubuntu on efnet.
[12:26] <dv_> but it was a dual one :P
[12:26] <tengil_> anyone have any suggestion how i can get picture on the tv and monitor the same time. i have a nvidia card and i been trying with alot of settings in xorg.conf now
[12:26] <Willa> Do i need a special DVD player? for 8 gig? and will ubuntu recognize it?
[12:27] <steve> but enyc if you think the controller card takes over int13 call wouldn't it be useless trying to install grub agianb to hd0?
[12:27] <Pelo> nolimitsoya,  I think easytag removes borked tags when it loads a file, that maybe why it is doing that
[12:27] <maxkelley> someonecallme?
[12:27] <kmarius> nolimitsoya, the handling is a bit weird ... you should do a few experiments first (but this goes for many tag apps i guess)
[12:27] <gpafixit> In the fstab file I noticed that the hda partitions/device has UUID=###### (numbrs/letters) .. does this effect how my newly installed hd shows up on my desktop? (I added it to my fstab /dev/hdb1 /media/StorageHD vfat etc etc etc ..
[12:27] <nolimitsoya> Pelo, removes as in clears or fix?
[12:27] <Pelo> as I clear I think
[12:28] <nolimitsoya> Pelo, ok, well thats broken behaviour right there imho...
[12:28] <Deez> am I being ignored!? how  do  I  stop  synaptic  OR  system-update  from  trying  to  update  an  application!?
[12:28] <Pelo> noliit yiou can try audio tag tool if you want
[12:28] <nolimitsoya> Pelo, thank you. i will
[12:29] <wceoscar> any ideas in how to remove my profile on amsn?????
[12:29] <nolimitsoya> Deez, in the menues of synaptic, look for force version
[12:29] <Byan> how do I tell the version of a package I want to install using apt-get
[12:29] <Byan> ?
[12:29] <LjL> Byan: "apt-cache policy packagename"
[12:29] <Byan> thanks
=== igor_ is now known as igcek
[12:29] <nolimitsoya> Deez, or you could try lock version...
[12:30] <Deez> nolimitsoya, I tried that so many times... it's killing me... I select xCHM, (the version that is installed without upgrading it) and I select Package > Force Version... *but* nothing happens!
[12:30] <Willa> woah, so freenode is larger than efnet?
[12:30] <Deez> nolimitsoya, lock and force don't do a thing :(
[12:30] <wceoscar> how can i remove the profile in amsn??????????????
[12:30] <Deez> nolimitsoya, I must be doing it wrong :(

[12:31] <Willa> you are powerless without your silly exclamation mark key.
[12:31] <dabaR> Pelo: :P
[12:31] <Deez> kmarius, heh, I wouldn't know which file it is at all :(

[12:32] <wceoscar> LjL, any ideas on how to remove my profile on amsn???????????
[12:32] <LjL> wceoscar: no
[12:32] <libolt> alright submitted a bug report asking for the packaging of the nvidia-cg-toolkit.

[12:32] <Willa> one day, I'm going to know thw powers of the bots
[12:32] <Willa> Just jealous
[12:32] <Silivrenion> in ubuntu, after installing openssh-server, will the server daemon automatically start with the machine everytime its restarted?
[12:32] <kmarius> Deez, try /etc/apt for a start -- i'm looking for something similar myself so my screen isn't powered back on all the time by some damn script
[12:32] <Silivrenion> (by default)
[12:33] <Deez> kmarius, ok
[12:33] <cornell> I'm trying to get a cronjob working, and it doesn't seem to want to work for me.  I've a script, backupMysqlCron2, in a directory.  I've an entry in crontab: 10 18 * * * root run-parts /nameOfDirectory  I take that to mean, run everything in /nameOfDirectory at 1810 hours.  But, nothing.  If I do run-parts /nameOfDirectory, it works.  Any ideas?

[12:33] <kippi> has anyone got wireless working on ubuntu?
[12:33] <Willa> oh
[12:33] <wceoscar> i guess there is a way
[12:33] <Willa> kippi I have.
[12:33] <wceoscar> where csaa ni fin d the amsn folder?
[12:33] <graft> yep, wireless
[12:33] <Willa> do you have the wmp54g or whatever?
[12:33] <n30n> I need help installing this wireless driver
[12:33] <H3g3m0n> !wireless
[12:33] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:34] <Lattyware> wceoscar: No. Noone has ever had ubuntu working with wireless cards, that's why everyone loves ubuntu.
[12:34] <Lattyware> </sarcasm>
[12:34] <kippi> Willa, how did do it?
[12:34] <Willa> kippi someone on efnet helped me step by step
[12:34] <dabaR> wceoscar: you could do something that is very unconventional, but will likely remove the profile, rm -rf .amsn
[12:34] <kmarius> Deez, infact, i'd just chmod -R -x /etc/apt and see what part of your system gets hosed ;)
[12:34] <Willa> Does ubuntu remember all command history?
[12:34] <Willa> in its cache.
[12:34] <boink> you mean bash
[12:34] <dabaR> wceoscar: how hard is it to look through some menus in a gui and find the right option?
[12:34] <Willa> is bash = terminal?
[12:34] <boink> check the .bash_history
[12:35] <boink> echo $SHELL
[12:35] <Willa> well I know I can KEY UP.
[12:35] <Pelo> Willa,  on a per session basis yes
[12:35] <Willa> so im wondering how far does it go back?
[12:35] <boink> it depends on what you have set in your .bashrc
[12:35] <Deez> kmarius, heh, I looked all up and down the dir... heh, I really wouldn't know where to start...
[12:35] <boink> man bash
[12:35] <Willa> Pelo: but there were comands from yesterday way after I reset the computer
[12:35] <Deez> I think force version and lock version in synaptic are BROKEN :(
[12:35] <Deez> *but* I might be doing it wrong too...
[12:35] <Jager> Whats a good p2p program for linux
[12:35] <boink> it has nothing to do with ubuntu
[12:35] <Pelo> Willa,  good for you then
[12:35] <Willa> kippi so did you setup the network name
[12:35] <boink> it depends on what shell you use
[12:35] <Lattyware> Jager: Azureus.
[12:35] <dabaR> Willa: people used to use what is called a terminal cause it was somehow connected to a computer physically, what we call terminal these days is a terminal emulator. You interact with the computer through a terminal using a command interpreter, or shell. the default Ubuntu shell is bash.
[12:36] <Jager> Lattyware thats torrent
[12:36] <Lattyware> Or uTorrent under wine.
[12:36] <Pelo> Jager,   torrents or frostwire
[12:36] <kmarius> Deez, exactly what program's versions do you want to be kept in their current state?
[12:36] <Willa> Pelo: Sorry im trying to help kippi out with my 4 days of ubuntu knowledge.
[12:36] <Lattyware> Jager: And torrents are suddenly not peer to peer?
[12:36] <Jager> Lattyware well.. you know what i mean lol
[12:36] <wceoscar> anyway.
[12:36] <Willa> unlike anyone else
[12:36] <H3g3m0n> Willa: By default 500 lines in Ubuntu i think
[12:36] <Willa> H3g3m0n hmm
[12:36] <wceoscar> can i use ubuntu with a wireless network?
[12:36] <Lattyware> And suddenly torrents are not the best form of peer to peer networking?
[12:36] <boink> wceoscar: sure
[12:36] <Lattyware> Torrents > Other P2P networks.
[12:36] <Willa> dont use newsgroups.
[12:36] <boink> !wireless
[12:36] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:37] <Willa> how about you guys just put in the topic
[12:37] <Willa> "use google"
[12:37] <Willa> and set the chan to +m
[12:37] <Deez> kmarius, I downloaded the source to xCHM and built it. the repos contain version 1.9 *but* the dev funked up and made the source version 1.10 ... I guess 1.9 keeps trying to overwrite 1.10... I cannot force or lock the version :(
[12:37] <wceoscar> ok
[12:37] <Lattyware> Willa: Because some people would type 'help with ubuntu' into google, and expect a result that works.
[12:37] <Pelo> Lattyware,   torrents and gnutella have different uses
[12:37] <Lattyware> meh
[12:37] <Deez> maybe force and lock in Synaptic is for different version packages found *only* in the repos :(
[12:37] <Willa> I know the wireless thing is a simple fix
[12:38] <Willa> that wifidoc isn't as helpful as you would think. to a complete n00b
[12:38] <kmarius> Deez, I know this maybe a rotten solution .. but again, you might want to try and chmod -R -w on the directories you want to keep
[12:38] <Deez> kmarius, I never thought of that and don't think I want to take that route :(

[12:41] <Willa> IndyGUnFreak, theres like a little lag every now and then. Or shutter.
[12:41] <dabaR> wceoscar: search google for blue ubuntu human theme
[12:41] <Willa> Not really noticeable.
[12:41] <profoX`> ma12: np..
[12:41] <graft> Willa: no - if your DVD rom drive can't keep up, try using a larger buffer/cache size (if your player allows it)
[12:41] <Willa> graft: I SAID local. from the hard drive.
[12:41] <Deez> Kervan, try eclipse...

[12:42] <Willa> then read the Q next time before you answer.
[12:42] <profoX`> gnomefreak: i'm not calling people names.. i'm telling him it's annoying to copy/paste 100 lines ;) because it is
[12:42] <dabaR> s8: how did it get started?

[12:42] <IndyGUnFreak> lol graft
[12:42] <yaloki> Kervan: really
[12:43] <fuffe> hey, I would like to question why ubuntu doesn't have releases like 6.10.1?
[12:43] <yaloki> Kervan: eclipse CDT is another candidate
[12:43] <fuffe> with bugfixes
[12:43] <Willa> fuffe: no.
[12:43] <LjL> fuffe: there is 6.06.1, actually
[12:43] <dabaR> fuffe: sometimes it does. If the bug is big enough.
[12:43] <IndyGUnFreak> because its perfect the first time.
[12:43] <Willa> ubuntu is a great os.
[12:43] <Willa> vs windows
[12:43] <rpedro> wceoscar: do 'apt-get install blubuntu-look' ;)
[12:43] <Willa> It loads so amazingly fast.
[12:43] <Kervan> yaloki i am a linux newbie  borland ide was too easy
[12:43] <Lattyware> cafuego_: Hmm... I tried wide, and it just added black bars :/
[12:43] <fuffe> Willa, but isn't it good to get a fresh version with bugfixes from 6.10?
[12:43] <IndyGUnFreak> i saw someone griping the other day cuz the next version of Linux is called Feisty Fawn, or something like that.
[12:43] <wceoscar> ok
[12:43] <dm> Anyone know how to remedy tiny icons in menu bar?????? themes arent helping
[12:44] <Deez> when will Edgy+1 be released?
[12:44] <IndyGUnFreak> if thats all you can find to gripe about, then its ok.
[12:44] <fuffe> Ljl, really? kool!
[12:44] <profoX`> gnomefreak: he doesn't care.. so why would you
[12:44] <Willa> fuffe: Im sure it is. But I'm just using it as a HTPC downstairs.
[12:44] <profoX`> and now shh
[12:44] <gnomefreak> profoX`: its against the COC
[12:44] <Willa> however, Ubuntu doesn't seem too secure
[12:44] <Lattyware> cafuego_:  The original is in a wide format - and squashing it is kinda bad as there are subs
[12:44] <jbroome> Willa: what?
[12:44] <Willa> what security features does Ubuntu have?
[12:44] <jbroome> Willa: i'm smell troll
[12:44] <gnomefreak> Deez: in april
[12:44] <wceoscar> another thing im not very familiar is instaling other sources files lice .rpm .tar what tools or stemps should i fllow to install this files>?
[12:44] <Willa> jbroome uh. I use ubuntu n00b
[12:44] <fuffe> too secure? is that a disadvantage?
[12:44] <Willa> or is fuffe the troll?
[12:44] <IndyGUnFreak> Willa, its biggest security feature is, its not windows.
[12:45] <Willa> IndyGUnFreak: ah ok. because You put your pw in
[12:45] <IndyGUnFreak> uh no.
[12:45] <Willa> saves it as a text file somewhere
[12:45] <Deez> gnomefreak, really? isn't that when Feisty is released?
[12:45] <Willa> yea there is a thread on ubuntu forums about it
[12:45] <fuffe> I've been called troll a lot lately, dunno why..
[12:45] <jbroome> wasn't that back in breezy?
[12:45] <Willa> for some users at least.
[12:45] <s8> i need to install nvidia graphics driver... and it's always complaining that i'm either running X (when using ctrl+alt+F#) or that i'm at a wrong runlevel...
[12:45] <gnomefreak> Deez: thats what edgy+1 is
[12:45] <dabaR> Deez: X+1 means the release after X
[12:45] <dm> Anyone know how to remedy tiny icons in menu bar?????? themes arent helping
[12:46] <Dev05> s8, You have to kill X
[12:46] <IndyGUnFreak> in the menu bar?
[12:46] <Deez> gnomefreak, so Dapper+1 is Edgy?
[12:46] <jbroome> yes
[12:46] <DevC> i'm in trouble, is there a way to reset the root password if I forget it because I can't seem to remember it and I need my root access to do the installs/updates/etc
[12:46] <gnomefreak> yes
[12:46] <Deez> heh
[12:46] <dabaR> fuffe: read up on the concept, and you may see similarities...happens to everyone
[12:46] <s8> the "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"  did not help

[12:46] <LjL> Deez: perhaps never
[12:46] <IndyGUnFreak> deez, it probably won't be
[12:46] <jbroome> !release
[12:46] <ubotu> Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[12:46] <gnomefreak> Deez: its not only LTS will have point releases

[12:47] <CoRnJuLiOx> alright, i just used diskmounter to mount a new partition i just made (ext3), but when i type in 'mount' it lists the partition as ntfs. am i missing something here?
[12:47] <fuffe> but I don't want to shut up and not express my opinion just because of that
[12:47] <Dev05> s8, Switch to say Ctr+Alt+F4. Log with your account. Type 'sudo su' (without quotes, of course). Enter your password. Type /etc/initd/gdm stop
[12:48] <Willa> gnomefreak, not really. No idea why I get a "enter" command.  Whilst everyone is typing 2 lines a second
[12:48] <bung> anyone know a linux version of like VirtualDub?
[12:48] <Dev05> s8 init.d
[12:48] <Deez> ok, I'll wait for Feisty... I thought the +1 version were maintenance releases like bug crushing, etc ... heh, I learned something... thanks again!
[12:48] <yaloki> bung: you can run virtualdub with wine

[01:11] <kippi> I have a wireless card, installed the drivers using nswrapper and it can see the driver and the card, but i can't connect to the wireless, how can i trouble shot this? It just gives me the bar saying getting IP address and then the bar just goes and then there is no connection

[01:12] <gnomefreak> webben: that is the flash for whatever version of ubuntu
[01:12] <gnomefreak> webben: he didnt say im having trouble installing flash 9 in firefox
[01:12] <Fall2Hell> when im installing it the directory is wrong and i cant chance it
[01:12] <superkirbyartist> wceoscar: If you only use AMSN for webcam support, try Kopete.  It's like Gaim + Webcams.
[01:12] <webben> Fall2Hell, what does that mean?
[01:12] <gnomefreak> Fall2Hell: flash9?
[01:12] <superkirbyartist> What is the main difference between IE7 and FF2?
[01:13] <wceoscar> not exactly...
[01:13] <Fall2Hell> flash 8 i think
[01:13] <LjL> wceoscar: it's a KDE program and thus requires the KDE libraries (will be installed automatically), though
[01:13] <gnomefreak> superkirbyartist: ones free and ones not for starters
[01:13] <webben> superkirbyartist, er? what do you mean the "main" difference?

[01:14] <codecaine_> and its connected it worked on dapper
[01:14] <gnomefreak> Fall2Hell: and the reason its not working is you still have the old flash stuff in you folder
[01:14] <webben> Fall2Hell, http://www.benjaminhawkeslewis.com/ubuntu/flash-player-9-beta.html
[01:14] <superkirbyartist> If people use IE will it be as easy to use FF>

[01:19] <gnomefreak> wceoscar: rpms are not supported in ubuntu but you can install alien to install rpms but it doesnt always work properly
[01:19] <ubotu> wceoscar, codecaine_: rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).

[01:20] <LjL> !limewire | wceoscar, if you really want it
[01:20] <ubotu> wceoscar, if you really want it: limewire is a popular P2P client running on the Gnutella network. To get it running, install !java first, then download Limewire from http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and finally run runLime.sh. Consider !FrostWire as an alternative.

[01:28] <itrebal> I've been trying to recompile my kernel, and so far I've been sucesful - it boots and all that just fine; the problem is my S-ATA drives arn't being seen, /dev/sd* doesn't exist at all; I've run MAKEDEV and compiled my kernel 5 times today to no avail, any thoughts?
[01:28] <timo90> i mannaged to sort out the internet connection shearing by my self :)
[01:29] <DralaFi> itrebal, make sure to include libata support and your sata device driver into the kernel
[01:29] <_adaptr> so I take it it's sheared now, then ?
[01:29] <Luci3n> nekr0z: it's not found it and i can't read anything data or video
[01:29] <DralaFi> Anyone here run their systems without initrd?
[01:30] <_adaptr> I have many systems that run without an initrd.. why do you ask ?
[01:30] <DreamerHxC> I have tried with NVIDIA and ATI but when I log in ubuntu, my system gets freezed, anyone knows something about it?
[01:30] <timo90> nekr0z:what the defoault passwod for the sheard network files
[01:30] <kalikiana> Does anybody have experience with (wlan) routers? Like what should I buy?
[01:30] <nekr0z> timo90: You mean they are on ubuntu machine? Which way is your samba configured? I mean, what do you have for "security" in /etc/samba/smb.conf
[01:30] <_adaptr> kalikiana: for preference, and if you already have a router, buy an AP only.. chances are it'll be bette rquality
[01:30] <itrebal> DralaFi: you wouldn't know the location of libata, would you? I'm going through menuconfig and don't have the convenience of libata
[01:30] <TurtleBoots> !horse-tits
[01:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about horse-tits - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:30] <LjL> !botabuse | TurtleBoots
[01:30] <ubotu> TurtleBoots: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[01:31] <Belboz99> hey, anyone know how to install the 32bit libusb on Edgy 64?
[01:31] <nekr0z> Luci3n: You just said you had it in nautilus?
[01:31] <TurtleBoots> oops :-(
[01:31] <acke_> anyone dualboot mac os and ubuntu? and does ubuntu automatically load if no option is selected in bootloadern?
[01:31] <nekr0z> timo90: There's no default one, it has to be set.
[01:31] <itrebal> DralaFi: rather, the QT frontend
[01:31] <acke_> in grub
[01:32] <DralaFi> _adaptr, I'm trying to figure out how to properly make kubuntu work without an initrd. Main problem seems to be that KDE isn't getting HAL messages.... Is this something you know something about? (I could write up a better explanation and put it on a pastebin)
[01:32] <thomsonr> Problem: Ubuntu freezes at end of progress bar on startup. Any ideas how to fix?
[01:32] <Luci3n> nekr0z: I can see it but it's not mapped to a folder the icon just states what it is "CD-RW/DVDR Drive"
[01:32] <_adaptr> DralaFi: first step would be to figure out what is IN the initrd Ubuntu uses.. it appears to be more than just modules , no ?
[01:33] <stefg> acke_: dualboot on Ubuntu-PPC uses the yaboot-Bootloader. You'll be able to configure what happens as default at boot.
[01:33] <nekr0z> Luci3n: So you put a CD in and it doesn't appear on the desktop and is no way accessible, right?
[01:34] <jorgext> hola
[01:34] <fio> How does one restart X server in Ubuntu?
[01:34] <jorgext> hi
[01:34] <itrebal> fio: Ctrl Alt Backspace?
[01:34] <Luci3n> nekr0z: Yes that's right
[01:34] <stefg> fio: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[01:34] <Luakagon> How do I use a .package file to install something?
[01:34] <fio> thank you
[01:34] <bluefox83> fio, from terminal it's sudo startx, from X it's ctrl alt backspace
[01:34] <DralaFi> _adaptr, yes. some early userspace tools, some scripts and the like. Most of it is already on the main system anyway. There's some framebuffer scripts as well as udev scripts. I made sure that /etc/rcS/S10udev had everything those udev scripts had...
[01:34] <fio> this will reload the xorg.conf file, right?
[01:35] <LjL> Luakagon: are you sure that something is not available from the official repos?
[01:35] <jorgext> how do i execute a *.run file??
[01:35] <LjL> jorgext: are you sure a package for that .run file isn't instead available from the official repos? :)
[01:35] <stefg> !nvidia
[01:35] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:35] <DralaFi> _adaptr, so I'm totally confused right now as everything that matters that was in initrd should be in the real filesystem. Yet KDE is not talking to HAL... not bringing up the nice mount screen.
[01:35] <bluefox83> jorgext, generally sudo ./whatever.run
[01:35] <jorgext> yes
[01:36] <jorgext> it is a ati driver
[01:36] <Luakagon> LjL, yes, I checked, warzone2100 isn't part of the official repos
[01:36] <nekr0z> Luci3n: Does a message in /var/log/syslog appear when you plug a cd in that a new device is added?
[01:36] <Luakagon> or any of the universe/multiverse one
[01:36] <DralaFi> itrebal, i'm looking. Not used to the QT config version.
[01:36] <_adaptr> DralaFi: initrd is usually loaded in a ramdisk which is a pseudo-filesystem for the duration... it can and often does work different from the same setup on the real filesystem
[01:37] <_adaptr> i.e. it won;'t work without significant changes to the startup scripts...
[01:37] <itrebal> DralaFi: but where is it in the menu? menuconfig is what I'm using from not being able to use xconfig
[01:37] <timo90> nekr0z:Do you know how to set one
[01:37] <LjL> Luakagon: well there appears to be an unofficial package specific to Ubuntu though. you might consider installing it instead http://www.ubuntugames.org/warzone2100 (though it *is* definitely unofficial)
[01:37] <varsendaggr> hi does anyone know how to find fluxbox?
[01:37] <DralaFi> itrebal, what kernel version?
[01:37] <nekr0z> timo90: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Share_files_using_Samba and you'll know this too ;-)
[01:37] <varsendaggr> i have been told that it comes with ubuntu but i cant find it
[01:38] <itrebal> DralaFi: 2.6.18.3
[01:38] <Luci3n> nekr0z: I've finally got it working thanks for your help
[01:38] <nekr0z> Luci3n: You're always welcome.
[01:39] <acke_> stefg, i have a mac mini dual boot, ssh running on ubuntu, i DONT have a monitor (only laptops and my mac box). since the day before yesterday, ubuntu dont fire up anymore.. I was checking my ubuntu logs, from mac os. but it seems as if ubuntu doesnt boot as it should, also it doesnt recieve an ip from the router. so, im kind of stuck. are there any boot up logs layin around i should look at, when i am trying to figure out where the boot
[01:39] <acke_> goes wrong?
[01:39] <nekr0z> Luci3n: Just for sporting interest, if you don't mind: what was the fault?
[01:39] <DralaFi> _adaptr, I didn't just copy it. Only minor changes. mostly made sure that all the calls to udev* were in the system script. In any case, udev works. dbus works. hal works. I'm only not sure about dbus-deamon --session (which I saw somewhere) but I don' think is in the process list.
[01:39] <varsendaggr> anybody know anything about fluxbox@@@
[01:39] <blanky> guys!
[01:39] <DralaFi> itrebal, hold on, let me cd to a comaprable dir
[01:39] <Belboz99> hey, does anyone know how to force architecture with ./configure?
[01:40] <varsendaggr> I really need help finding it on my computer
[01:40] <itrebal> DralaFi: thanks
[01:40] <varsendaggr> does it come with ubuntu
[01:40] <_adaptr> DralaFi: sorry, I haven;t spent any time unraveling the mysteries of ubutnu's initrd :)
[01:40] <Scisla1> So, I installed a package that didn't work and went to remove it, on removal I got an error. Now I can't install, remove, or reinstall anything.
[01:40] <Scisla1> Any ideas?
[01:40] <blanky> when I put the CD in the drive, it went to safe graphics mode or whatever and now that it's installed, everything's on a high resolution, I went to change my resolution and the highest is 800x600, what's wrong?!?!
[01:40] <blanky> someone please! :'(
[01:40] <varsendaggr> fluxbox
[01:40] <varsendaggr> anyone
[01:40] <Fall2Hell> ive downloaded the flash player 7 but i cant make it work
[01:40] <jbroome> !tell blanky about resolution
[01:40] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell: i had the same problem
[01:40] <DralaFi> _adaptr, that;s ok. It's really annoying though that no-one can help :/ I'd rather not boot back to the original kubuntu kernel... a bit old and it boots all kinds of stuff i don't need.
[01:41] <blanky> i love you jbroome :) hope it works
[01:41] <jbroome> aww
[01:41] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell: do you just want version 7 or newer?
[01:41] <DreamerHxC> I have tried with NVIDIA and ATI but when I log in ubuntu, my system gets freezed, anyone knows something about it?
[01:41] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr do u know how to solve it?
[01:41] <Luakagon> LjL, is that exclusively espanol? :s
[01:41] <Scisla1> synaptic throws me: E: The package wpasupplicant needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
[01:41] <Scisla1> E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report.
[01:41] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  i know how to install flash player 9... does that work?
[01:41] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr newer if i could
[01:42] <Fall2Hell> y
[01:42] <varsendaggr> version 9 is newest
[01:42] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  version 9 is newest
[01:42] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr it work. :)
[01:42] <LjL> Luakagon: that's portuguese actually, but if you look toward the end of the page, there's instructions that point to the package... those should be understandable even by reading the commands alone. or use Babelfish or something
[01:42] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  it already did?
[01:42] <BlackHawk> gn8
[01:42] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr nop
[01:42] <DralaFi> itrebal, Main menu -> Device Drivers -> Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA (experimental) drivers

[01:43] <delire> DreamerHxC: you have both drivers installed, ie for NVIDIA and ATI?
[01:43] <Luci3n> nekr0z: I've no idea i've been here for 2 hour and suddenly it mouted it and it was accessible
[01:43] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr for urs instroctions
[01:43] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr can u tell me how can i install it?
[01:44] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell: im not sure what site it was someone sent me the link and i didnt save it :( all i know is that there IS a version for ubuntu of flash player 9
[01:44] <blanky> same thing! :(
[01:44] <Luci3n> nekr0z: thanxs again :)
[01:44] <blanky> I think it's because it chose safe graphics mode when I installed
[01:44] <blanky> so now everything is 'safe graphics'
[01:44] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell: sorry i didnt save the link ill try looking in my history
[01:44] <blanky> !tell me about resolution
[01:44] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  be back in a minute
[01:44] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr thx
[01:44] <DreamerHxC> [delire]  I don't think so
[01:44] <DreamerHxC> because I formated

[01:45] <itrebal> DralaFi: its missing something in the middle, I think
[01:45] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  omg i have it set to get rid of private data :(
[01:45] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr np
[01:45] <Fall2Hell> varsendaggr thx anyway :)
[01:45] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  i really have no idea... really sorry
[01:46] <DevC> could someone have ubotu send me the link again for the notes on upgrading so I can upgrade from the version I have to the new 6.10
[01:46] <DralaFi> itrebal, it might depend on other options. ie. if you selected "compile only drivers that are expected to compile ok"
[01:46] <varsendaggr> Fall2Hell:  have you ever used fluxbox?
[01:46] <itrebal> DralaFi: are you using the menuconfig or qt?
[01:46] <noiesmo> DevC, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[01:46] <DralaFi> itrebal, menuconfig
[01:47] <DevC> thanks :)
[01:47] <varsendaggr> @@@@@ ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW I CAN FIND FLUXBOX ON MY COMPUTER @@@@@
[01:47] <varsendaggr> I HEARD THAT IT COMES WITH UBUNTU BUT I CANT FIND IT
[01:47] <Music_Shuffle> "find"?
[01:48] <defrysk> caps ?
[01:48] <itrebal> DralaFi: I checked "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers" in Come Maturity Options
[01:48] <Music_Shuffle> Stop capsing...yeesh.
[01:48] <jbroome> the caps lock key comes with ubuntu also
[01:48] <DralaFi> variant, stop shouting
[01:48] <varsendaggr> does it come with ubuntu?
[01:48] <Music_Shuffle> No.
[01:48] <varsendaggr> sorry my bad
[01:48] <gerry_> varsendaggr: sudo apt-get install fluxbox
[01:48] <wapityyy> does anyone have a good guide on how to install ET on edgy ?
[01:49] <varsendaggr> gerry_ : i am new to this... where do i type that?
[01:49] <DralaFi> itrebal, i'm just about to create a real 2.6.18.3 dir, i'll see what it depends on. What sata device do you have?
[01:49] <gerry_> varsendaggr: you can use synaptic, or the terminal but you need universe repositories enabled
[01:49] <itrebal> DralaFi: not sure on the maker of it, so far I've just been using every one they offer; its a Gigabyte motherboard though, AMD/nVidia
[01:50] <varsendaggr> gerry_: um... i have a friend who knows ubuntu and i think he might have installed it already from there
[01:50] <varsendaggr> gerry_: how do i find it?
[01:50] <gerry_> realplay won't output sound... even if i use aoss

[01:51] <LjL> varsendaggr: sorry, such behavior is not acceptable, no matter how frustrated your Ubuntu problems may have got you. you're muted for 10 minutes
[01:51] <delire> DreamerHxC: i have to go, but try explaining the problem in detail as best as you can. have a close look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log for clues also, even paste it into a public place (like a pastebin) so others can help you diagnose the problem.
[01:51] <gerry_> LjL. bit harsh?
[01:51] <dcordes> why does my printer not appear when i add it with a custom driver file in the gnome printer manager? it is a canon pixma mp150 and i have the ppd file from the turbo print installation
[01:51] <itrebal> DralaFi: ALi
[01:52] <DreamerHxC> [delire]  I have already tried, but no one knows
[01:52] <DreamerHxC> I've posted in forums
[01:52] <DreamerHxC> 3 times
[01:52] <DevC> wait,...doing the upgrade like the site says only pops up software updates, how is updating my software going to upgrade me to newer versions of Ubuntu o_O
[01:53] <DralaFi> itrebal, sorry, I was looking at the wrong kernel version. Main Menu -> Device Drivers -> SCSI device support
[01:53] <emmettshear> Is there a compelling reason to buy a barebones system instead of assembling it yourself out of a case, motherboard, powersupply? (if this is OT please tell me which channel would be better)
[01:53] <acke_> hey yaboot timout = 100, says it doesnt boot at all or that it waits 100 s to boot>

[01:53] <VSpike> having trouble with my mp3 player... gets mounted as usbdisk on desktop and in /media, but when I right-click and select "Safely Remove", nothing happens.  Last time it did this, I tried "sudo umount /media/usbdisk" and it corrupted the device's filesystem.  So what should I do to unmount it cleanly?  running edgy
[01:53] <DralaFi> itrebal, enable: SCSI disk support, SCSI generic support, then enter sub-menu "SCSI low-level drivers"
[01:54] <gerry_> VSpike, whats the device
=== gerry_ is now known as easytiger
[01:55] <VigoFusion> VSpike: Did you try a purge and clean install?
[01:55] <DralaFi> itrebal, select Serial ATA (SATA) support, there are only a few drivers there. not sure which should be used for "ALi"
[01:55] <DevC> I did gksu "update-manager -c" and it said my version was no longer supported then loads and says to update the software....how is that upgrading ubuntu if it is only the software I'm updating? or does it upgrade while I'm doing those updates?
[01:55] <VSpike> Samsung YP-Z5F
[01:55] <VSpike> gerry: Samsung YP-Z5F
[01:55] <itrebal> DralaFi: I've got all the ones that look possible, thanks!
[01:55] <madman91> how can i see the current temperatures in of my cpu .. mobo.. vid card.. etc..
[01:55] <VSpike> VigoFusion: not sure I follow you.. of what?
[01:55] <easytiger> VSpike, dunno it.. but can you not just type sync and then unplug it?
[01:55] <DralaFi> itrebal, good luck :)
[01:56] <easytiger> VSpike, usually works
[01:56] <easytiger> on vfat devices
[01:56] <itrebal> DralaFi: thansk :) started the compile
[01:56] <noldon> hi anyone now were i can download americas army for ubuntu
[01:56] <Luakagon> that would be cool
[01:56] <VSpike> easytiger: cool, I wasn't aware of that command - thanks
[01:56] <jbroome> noldon: pull it from the AA site
[01:56] <noldon> hi anyone now were i can download americas army for ubuntu
[01:56] <VigoFusion> Just ideling to keep the screen moveing, I asked if you had used the --purge command and installed or just installed an overlay, I am a noob.
[01:57] <easytiger> VSpike, np
[01:57] <VigoFusion> :-$
[01:57] <noldon> jbroome i looked there but i dont get were it is
[01:57] <itrebal> DralaFi: I hope to not return, but if I must... you understand :) later!
[01:57] <easytiger> noldon, i think they arent currently supporting linux.. i think the old version can be found on bitorrent etc
[01:57] <madman91> how can i see the current temperatures in of my cpu .. mobo.. vid card.. etc..
[01:57] <noldon> easytiger ok
[01:58] <noldon> hmm i keep looking then
[01:58] <VigoFusion> madman91: I got a thing in synaptic that does that
[01:58] <madman91> VigoFusion: do you know what its called?
[01:59] <VSpike> easytiger: well, to be fair that doesn't seem to have corrupted, so I'll use that
[01:59] <VSpike> easytiger: thanks
[01:59] <easytiger> VSpike, no worries. i've forgotten it a few times. and messed up a usb stick :p
[02:00] <easytiger> VSpike, though you can set to autosync, but i believe it is slower in writing then
[02:00] <VigoFusion> let me open it and see what the nameis.....
[02:01] <jbroome> noldon: http://www.fileshack.com/file.x?fid=3051   Google is hard
[02:01] <varsendaggr> hello, can anyone please tell me how to get an aplication and how to find it once i do?
[02:02] <VigoFusion> System Info, it tells me the commands to use to find stuff out like that.
[02:02] <jonasan> does anyone understand the ubuntu fstab naming conventions? i.e. # /dev/hdb5 UUID=100eca04-f49f-4af6-9027-1e47caced761
[02:02] <VigoFusion> The app is called Hardinfo
[02:03] <VigoFusion> I got it from Synaptic
[02:04] <varsendaggr> could anyone please tell me howto install an aplication im new to ubuntu

[02:05] <varsendaggr> Luakagon: how do i find that
[02:05] <kingsley> How should I diagnose why ping started returning "Destination Host Unreachable" after replacing debian with 6.10?
[02:05] <VigoFusion> Synaptic is our friend
[02:05] <Luakagon> varsendaggr, I guess you type in 'sudo synaptic' in a terminal
[02:05] <VSpike> yep, and fluxbox is in the list
[02:05] <easytiger> naitmer: just get the linux .bin and add the jdk1.5.x/bin dir to your /etcprofile path

[02:09] <easytiger> blake, ahh :p

[02:09] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse

[02:11] <madman91> VigoFusion: it doesnt show temperatures though does it ??
[02:11] <varsendaggr> VigoFusion: thank you, then do i find fluxbox under the list?
[02:11] <_Omega> You'll have to use closed source 3D drivers.
[02:11] <VigoFusion> madman91: I think it gives the CPU tm command to use
[02:12] <TokenBad> how use p7zip in ubuntu...I have it installed but can't find command
[02:12] <VigoFusion> madman91: I am learning this stuff daily, I just got the AV installed! :-P
[02:12] <madman91> lol
[02:13] <Luakagon> oh no!
[02:13] <blake> _0mega closed source 3D drives?
[02:13] <Fall2Hell> can anyone tell me how to remove a directory?
[02:13] <_Omega> Do you have an ATI or NVidia video card?
[02:13] <madman91> VigoFusion: so how do i see the temp?

[02:13] <varsendaggr> VigoFusion: how do i install it? or is it installed if its on the list?
[02:13] <blake> _0mega nVidia 6600 LE
[02:14] <_Omega> Blake, have you done anything to get new drivers for your video card or are you running with what Ubuntu gave you?
[02:14] <fildo> rm -rf /
[02:14] <fildo> ;p
=== cari_tmn_ce is now known as co_holicxz
[02:14] <Fall2Hell> jbroome thx
[02:14] <VigoFusion> madman91: I actually have a thermal sensor installed on my box, it shows up in true geek LED on a side clock looking thing.
[02:14] <_Omega> Blake, The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you have the NVidia proprietary AKA: "closed source" drivers installed.
[02:14] <blake> _0mega i simply dont know. i downloaded a driver. i dont think it was the latest 1 tho
[02:14] <defrysk> rm -rf /path/to/folder/
[02:15] <_Omega> Blake, you can do that using Synaptic.
[02:15] <blake> _0mega ok 1 sec. guide me on what to do
[02:15] <madman91> VigoFusion: thats the way to do it
[02:15] <_Omega> Blake, once you've done that, head over to winehq.com and add their ubuntu repository to synaptic and install their wine package.  That will keep you up to date and give you about everything you need to get rockin'.  You're lucky that you have NVidia.
[02:15] <slicky> ow.. im so tired of this.. iv been trying to get the xgl, fgrlx and ati drivers working with direct rendering and 3d acceleration for the last 4 days.. pls.. can anyone help me out?

[02:16] <Luakagon> I need to know how to get beyond this dpkg error

[02:17] <_Omega> Blake, what chat program are you using?
[02:18] <guest_> chatzilla
[02:18] <ShadowNYC> why use one not the other. whats kde advantages, what are gnome's ?
[02:18] <ShadowNYC> eeeeek

[02:19] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[02:19] <blanky> what's up guys
[02:19] <ShadowNYC> greets
[02:19] <easytiger> slicky, maybe the amd deal will make the support better
[02:19] <_Omega> guest_ Programs should be easy to use, not frustrating.
[02:19] <jengc0il> hi blanky
[02:19] <slicky> easytiger:  how do u mean?
[02:19] <ShadowNYC> q: ubuntu vs kubuntu.. which one to install?
[02:19] <guest_> Omega, true
[02:19] <Drake> hi... i just set up xchat , how can i see the userlist?
[02:19] <blake> _0mega hold on just a sec k
[02:19] <blanky> lo
[02:19] <_Omega> ShadowNYC, that is a McDonald's / Burger King kind of question :)
[02:19] <guest_> chatzilla is working out for me, it's a good means to an end
[02:19] <varsendaggr> hello, could someone please tell me how to install something in "synaptic package manager" im new to ubuntu
[02:19] <ShadowNYC> is there a live kubuntu disc i can mount and peek at the interface?
[02:20] <_Omega> Blake, I reccomend using Gaim's IRC support if you have it installed.
[02:20] <ShadowNYC> yeah I realize, _Omega :)
[02:20] <_Omega> Blake, It makes things very familiar for the new users.
[02:20] <guest_> not too worried about the means to get to the IRC end
[02:20] <blanky> ShadowNYC: they're both the same
[02:20] <jengc0il> blanky: do i must have a 2 swap partition if i want 2 install 2 linux OS
[02:20] <LjL> ShadowNYC: well, if there's both, it's probably because some people prefer one over the other. anyway, it's easy to use KDE even on Ubuntu, or Gnome even on Kubuntu, so it's not that big an issue.
[02:20] <easytiger> slicky, just maybe amd will do something about the crap ati drivers now they own ati
[02:20] <blanky> ShadowNYC: ubuntu just comes pre-installed with gnome, kubuntu with kde
[02:20] <blake> _0mega go to channel ##wow
[02:20] <ShadowNYC> gotcha
[02:20] <_Omega> ShadowNYC, I like Ubuntu.  While I like the concept behind QT, I really don't like KDE.
[02:20] <Pelo> !fax
[02:20] <blanky> but you can install either/both on each/any
[02:20] <elan> the userlist is on the right side. you just have to resize it
[02:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fax - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:20] <blanky> jengc0il: no you don't, as far as I know
[02:20] <slicky> easytiger:  ye.. let hope so
[02:20] <jengc0il> blanky tq

[02:21] <ShadowNYC> next question.. will ubuntu run on a p3-600 with 128megs of ram (dont ask) or should i simply double boot it on this workstation which is a p4-d/512megs
[02:21] <varsendaggr> guest_: i did
[02:21] <ShadowNYC> or wait for a new core2duo pc ;)
[02:21] <Drake> how can i see the userlist?  i am using the xchat client!!!

[02:22] <blanky> this thing ( http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy ) just looks like they used the same thing they've been using and put 'Edgy' at the top
[02:22] <cafuego_> ShadowNYC: It'l run, but Gnome won't be happy. A lightweight window manager/desktop env should be fine though (try Xubuntu perhaps)
[02:22] <DarkMageZ> ShadowNYC, i had it running on a similar p3. it's sluggish. i'd suggest getting more ram for the p3
[02:22] <ShadowNYC> yeah...
[02:22] <guest_> Wow it's pretty chaotic in here...hard to follow up with all the text
[02:22] <_Omega> ShadowNYC: I wouldn't reccomend it.
[02:22] <DarkMageZ> guest_, i call this idle for this channel :P
[02:22] <guest_> fluxbox should come with your ubuntu cd
[02:22] <ShadowNYC> i hear that.. getting ram for the pc is not an option.. :(
[02:22] <_Omega> ShadowNYC: Gnome OR KDE will have a hard time running in that given it's current state.  Consider xubuntu.  XFCE is GREAT.
[02:22] <ShadowNYC> gotcha
[02:22] <blanky> ShadowNYC: try xubuntu
[02:23] <guest_> haha darkmage, I'm a bit new
[02:23] <cafuego_> ShadowNYC: 256Mb is pretty much the smallest amount of ram you'd want for Gnome on Ubuntu. (Command line is a different matter :-)
[02:23] <_Omega> ShadowNYC: XFCE is also a great way to start learning Linux because it gives you the GUI you want but keeps it simple.
[02:23] <ShadowNYC> excellent
[02:23] <ShadowNYC> how about dual booting
[02:23] <blanky> or, you can install server mode, hehe, and really learn linux, but that's boring
[02:23] <blanky> I did that on my ooolllddd computer
[02:23] <VigoFusion> What is the Terminal command to see if I have Squids?
[02:23] <blanky> but apparently the learning part didn't work
[02:23] <ShadowNYC> lol
[02:23] <blanky> VigoFusion: sudo apt-get install squid, see if it's already installed? what?
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> no thanks. no need for me to get crazy with it
[02:24] <cafuego_> VigoFusion: squids?
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> exactly
[02:24] <guest_> So if you want fluxbox you just need to to choose it at the login splashcreen
[02:24] <blanky> I think he means squid
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> squid == the proxy
[02:24] <cafuego_> VigoFusion: 'dpkg -l squid'
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> :)
[02:24] <VigoFusion> Yes, squid
[02:24] <blanky> guest_: yeah after installing it, there might be more information at
[02:24] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[02:24] <guest_> if it's not there, go to howtoforge.com and I'm sure you'll find a nice howto

[02:24] <cafuego_> ShadowNYC: yes, but 'squid' != 'Squids' ;-)
[02:24] <Byan> anyone here use cacti?
[02:24] <blanky> oh, I thought guest_ was asking the question LOL
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> hehehe
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> not at all!
[02:24] <ShadowNYC> squids == something you see on the discovery channel :)
[02:25] <guest_> Oh no, but thanks ubotu, someone else asked
[02:25] <ShadowNYC> wait.. isnt,... .dr zoidberg a squid? :)
[02:25] <ShadowNYC> futurama is so bender-rrific :)

[02:30] <guest_> I'll have to get it up and running
[02:30] <ShadowNYC> try it
[02:30] <naught101>  anyone ever have problems with their web browser locking up when loading sites? happens to me with firefox and Konqueror, and doesn't happen on other computers on same router
[02:30] <guest_> That's what I thought byan
[02:30] <ShadowNYC> utorrent==linux & windows isnt it?
[02:30] <DarkY> i think i shitted my gnome
[02:30] <ShadowNYC> just closed source
[02:30] <DarkY> after installing AIGLX
[02:30] <DarkY> its blac
[02:30] <bruenig> utorrent + wine == good linux fun times
[02:31] <ShadowNYC> heh
[02:31] <DarkY> and a white blinking button
[02:31] <DarkY> <.<
[02:31] <HYB> Heh, i tricked XGL/Beryl into thinking the top and bottom of the cube are workspaces
[02:31] <guest_> Well everyone who responded utorrent, I'm assuming they're running it on their linux box
[02:31] <DarkY> and i can write in it
[02:31] <DarkY> O
[02:31] <n30n> xserver explodes into a firey casum of death and destruction everytime i update it
[02:31] <K^Holtz> a lot of my screensavers are just staying as blank screens... is the something wrong w/ my video settings or something?
[02:31] <guest_> Ah so there is no utorrent for linux yet
[02:31] <fulld> quiz: what are some dns servers that don't blow?
[02:32] <guest_> So is there a decent torrent client I can run on ubuntu without having to run wine?
[02:32] <ShadowNYC> actually im running it in debian on that ancient 128meg pc, no windows manager installed
[02:32] <ShadowNYC> sure
[02:32] <ShadowNYC> utorent and azureus both run natively
[02:32] <bruenig> no, but it works flawlessly in wine. Except that sometimes when I minimize it and then try to maximize it, it won't maximize. The window will pop up but it will be blank. I have to click on the tray icon to minimize to tray and then maximize again for it to show
[02:32] <peter__> .
[02:32] <DarkY> azureus is java based
[02:32] <ShadowNYC> yep
[02:32] <ShadowNYC> sucky , oi know
[02:32] <DarkY> so it run on every java platformed operating system
[02:32] <guest_> I see, thanks brue, so there's still ironing out bugs here and then on linux
[02:33] <guest_> perhaps I'll use it running on wine then
[02:33] <guest_> there's = they're
[02:33] <ShadowNYC> my bad.. utorrent doesnt
[02:33] <ShadowNYC> run on linux... natively that is
[02:33] <ShadowNYC> id just run azureus 'headless' without the interface.. it works fine from command line
[02:33] <guest_> That's ok I guess, I'll just run it on top of Wine
[02:33] <ShadowNYC> yeah
[02:34] <ShadowNYC> that to
[02:34] <ShadowNYC> too

[02:40] <sorush20> I keep getting complete freezes.. duing kim image resize or konqueror thumbnail generation..
[02:40] <easytiger> !kernel
[02:40] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[02:40] <sizzam> easytiger: sudo aptitude install linux-headers
[02:40] <guest_> is ubotu a bot?
[02:40] <sizzam> yes
[02:41] <guest_> sweet.
[02:41] <DarkY> where is the source.list
[02:41] <DarkY> i dont find it O
[02:41] <sizzam> DarkY: /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:41] <easytiger> sizzam, i mean the whole source
[02:41] <guest_> you can do a find -name sources.list to find out
[02:43] <bruenig> !hi | dabaR
[02:43] <ubotu> dabaR: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[02:43] <sizzam> easytiger: sudo apt-get install linux-source
[02:43] <sizzam> easytiger: or sudo aptitude install linux-source
[02:43] <easytiger> sizzam, cool
[02:43] <guest_> What are kernel header files and why are they important?
[02:43] <blanky> guys...my computer's making noises :'(
[02:43] <blanky> like a sound
[02:43] <blanky> song
[02:44] <blanky> it might be gaim
[02:44] <sizzam> guest_: some applications need them to compile kernel modules correctly
[02:44] <Jager> Would someone like to help me figure out why I cant boot into windows? :S
[02:44] <bruenig> blanky, slap the case
[02:44] <blanky> *looks over shoulder*
[02:44] <guest_> I see sudo apt-get and sudo aptitude, they essentially both do the same thing right
[02:44] <bruenig> guest_, essentially
[02:44] <blanky> guest_: just use apt-get it's cooler
[02:44] <guest_> I've been using apt-get
[02:44] <sorush20> is there an anticrash program out there?
[02:44] <Jager> is H3g3m0n here still?
[02:44] <cafuego_> cooler?
[02:44] <guest_> I also like sudo apt-cache search
[02:44] <cafuego_> What is the point of that?
[02:45] <bruenig> sorush20, no
[02:45] <guest_> but I like the GUI of adept better
[02:45] <bruenig> guest_, you can just do apt-cache, no need for sudo
[02:45] <jar`> hi i just installed beryl on my ubuntu 6.1 and now I have some problems which i think came from it
[02:45] <cafuego_> guest_: apt-cache search doesn't require root, so you can run it without sudo.
[02:45] <bruenig> jar`, #ubuntu-xgl
[02:45] <sorush20> how can I optimize my system so that it would crash less on some batch process like resizing images..
[02:45] <guest_> bruenigh, my home folder is not local, so that's why I have to use sudo
[02:46] <guest_> it's an nfs share that lives on another server
[02:46] <bruenig> guest_, ok
[02:46] <cafuego_> sorush20: it shouldn't crash on that *at all* *ever*
[02:46] <cafuego_> sorush20: Is it running out of ram?
[02:46] <jar`> my login screen changed and I have no icons for shutdown/restart
[02:46] <sizzam> guest_: aptitude does a better job of keeping track of child packages than apt-get,  so if you install with aptitude its easier to uninstall the package and all dependency packages
[02:47] <guest_> Ah, very good to know thanks sizzam
[02:47] <cheez> can someone tell me a good, friendly command-line irc program please?
[02:47] <guest_> chatzilla
[02:47] <bruenig> apt-get in edgy tracks packages quite well, an apt-get autoremove will remove orphaned dependencies. Aptitude doesn't even give you the choice, it removes them automatically
[02:47] <guest_> Though I'm still trying to figure out how to log it all on a flie
=== markster23_ is now known as mark23
[02:47] <cheez> chatzilla is command line?
[02:48] <guest_> there's some great info  here
[02:48] <cafuego_> cheez: irssi is probably the best of them (but you will need to know some /commands)
[02:48] <bruenig> cheez, bitchx
=== yama is now known as yama_away
[02:48] <bruenig> cheez, irssi
[02:48] <cheez> alright
[02:48] <cheez> thank you
[02:49] <CoRnJuLiOx> crap. could someone lend me a hand? i'm having a whole bunch of different problems that i need help with :-(
[02:49] <guest_> So can I install bitchx using cygwin on my windows box?
=== ian_ is now known as cheez
[02:49] <cafuego_> guest_: Probably easier to just sue bitchx for windows to begin with
[02:50] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh
=== cheez is now known as ianthepetrock
[02:50] <guest_> True, but I also have a linux box it would be nice to have a CLI chat client
[02:50] <guest_> IRC client rather
[02:50] <Plouj> hi
[02:50] <Plouj> for some reason I cannot connect a Ubuntu laptop to my samba server

[02:50] <FunnyLookinHat> guest_, irssi
[02:51] <CoRnJuLiOx> i'm trying to install realplayer from synaptic, but it says i have unresolvable dependencies. it needs xlibs but it can't install xlibs. what do i do?
[02:51] <cafuego_> guest_: I tend to use Gaim for IRC on Windows.
[02:51] <Plouj> I went to the "Connect to Server" thingy, I entered the server's dns name, entered a user name, clicked connect, and it shows a blank folder view
[02:51] <blanky> !aiglx
[02:51] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[02:51] <Jager> H3g3m0n, you think you could help me fix my prob with windows not booting? :) Im on linux now, so it would be alot easier ;)
[02:51] <guest_> windows I'm fine with, it would be nice to get a CLI irc client working on my lnux box, I'll give irssi a try, sudo apt-cache search'ing it now...
[02:52] <Plouj> also, I can't see any shares on the server if I browse for windows servers
[02:52] <H3g3m0n> Jager: yeh
[02:52] <Jager> H3g3m0n Thanks
[02:52] <H3g3m0n> Jager: If mount still says / is on /dev/hdb, check what hda is 'dmesg | grep hda'
[02:52] <aribo> anybody experience with installing the alsa drivers ?

[02:54] <Jager> H3g3m0n: the first line??
[02:54] <H3g3m0n> yeh
[02:54] <Jager> H3g3m0n: /dev/hdb2 on / type ext3
[02:54] <H3g3m0n> try 'dmesg | grep hda' and see if its actually anything then
[02:54] <markginter_24> Hello.  Does anyone happen to know why I can insert an ogg into Openoffice w/ Ubuntu but not with Fedora 6?
[02:55] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Might be worth trying hd1,0 as your windows drive though
[02:55] <guest_> If I need to find a file on my linux box, say 'thisfile.txt' is the right command $find -name thisfile.txt /
[02:55] <H3g3m0n> in grub
[02:55] <Jager> H3g3m0n: i tried that once, it gave me some error
[02:55] <Plouj> nvm, it works now, for some reason...
[02:55] <H3g3m0n> guest_: 'locate thisfile.txt' is faster
[02:56] <guest_> yeah i use that on my OS X box
[02:56] <guest_> but it looks at some database doesnt it
[02:56] <Jager> H3g3m0n: [17179573.108000]      ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe400-0xe407, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:DMA
[02:56] <jbroome> updatedb
[02:56] <Jager> Ive no idea what that means
[02:57] <guest_> jbroome, don't I have to run a manual command to update the update.db file?
[02:57] <guest_> Or does it do it daily by itself?
[02:57] <H3g3m0n> Jager: 'cd /proc/ide; ls -lha'
[02:57] <jbroome> guest_: sudo updatedb
[02:57] <jbroome> it *should* be in cron.daily and run everynight
[02:58] <bruenig> guest_, should be find / -name thisfile.txt, I am pretty sure
[03:00] <sysrage> ubuntu is a binary distro right? precompiled stuff?
[03:00] <Jager> H3gem0n: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34029/
[03:00] <bruenig> sysrage, yeah
[03:00] <guest_> Ah, ok thanks a bunch bruenigh. So find [where]  [argument]  [filename]

[03:01] <bruenig> sysrage, you can compile you rown stuff if you want, but the repositories are all precompiled
[03:01] <bruenig> your own*
[03:01] <guest_> Jbroome, I think update.db gets update in /etc/cron.daily/updater
[03:01] <guest_> but I'm not sure
[03:01] <sysrage> good :) been using slackware and gentoo for a long time.. i'm ready for a binary distro :)
[03:01] <guest_> I'll have to find out which of the cron jobs are repsonsible for updating the updatedb
[03:02] <VigoFusion> Ima gonna re-bootstrap,its a habbit
[03:03] <gyaresu> wc
[03:03] <Madpilot> hmm... is ubuntuforums down, or is my internet connection fubar'd again?
[03:03] <IndyGUnFreak> seems to be down.
[03:03] <FunnyLookinHat> Madpilot, works for me
[03:03] <markginter_24> working for me ...
[03:03] <__Gino__> works for me...

[03:04] <IndyGUnFreak> nt workin for me, says domain maintenance
[03:04] <sizzam> works for me
[03:04] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Your systems really odd, you have 3 hdX based drives, none of them are hda
[03:04] <Jager> O_o
[03:04] <H3g3m0n> Jager: How many cdroms you have in there?
[03:04] <Jager> 2
[03:04] <Madpilot> heh. thanks, all. My landlord's cheap router has DNS trouble regularly, so I'm never sure if it's a server issue or my DNS again..
[03:04] <H3g3m0n> ah that would explain it
[03:04] <IndyGUnFreak> i like LInuxquestions.org anyways
[03:05] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Sounds like your primary harddrive is the slave on the primary ide channel
[03:05] <Jager> h3gem0n: Really?
[03:05] <ezenu3> I'm doing some random testing with valgrind, e.g., "valgrind find -name foo.txt" and "valgrind ls -laRh" -- I see memory leaks.. is valgrind just not working right, or are there truly memory leaks?
[03:05] <guest_> Say I need to install a secondary SATA drive on my machine. The order in which I need to do thins is the following I believe. 1. Connect it 2. turn the machine on. 3. format the drive 4. mount the drive
[03:06] <easytiger> anyone use qemu?
[03:06] <Jager> h3g3m0n: So should I just switch it?...
[03:06] <H3g3m0n> Jager: That would probally render the system unbootable since its all coded for hdb now
[03:06] <Jager> >_<
[03:06] <guest_> Formatting is done via cfdisk correct? I would have to run cfdisk to /dev/hdb
[03:06] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Probally just need to figure out where grub sees things
[03:07] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Try typing 'grub' and then 'geometry (hd0)'
[03:07] <Jager> H3g3m0n: alright
[03:07] <H3g3m0n> grub might take a while to load
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[03:08] <ivx> hey i'm trying to do something and it asks me for my password, and i know i am entering it right, but it keeps saying it is wrong, how can i reset it or something?
[03:08] <H3g3m0n> Jager: You can also try lilo installing the lilo boot loader instead of grub, its much simpler and used linux device name but need to be manually updated after config file changes and kernel updates
[03:09] <Jager> H3g3m0n: is the updating for lilo a pain?
[03:09] <H3g3m0n> Jager: You just type lilo, and it does everything
[03:09] <Jager> oh okay
[03:09] <H3g3m0n> Its possible synaptic does it automagically, i dunno
[03:10] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Do you think it would be better (easier) to just install lilo than to keep troubleshooting the grub thing?
[03:10] <_Omega> aah!  lilo
[03:10] <scrognale> in the Edgy CD, is there an upgrade option? or do i have to write over dapper. I don't have an internet connection on it, so I can't just run the update command
[03:10] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Maby, but i've never used lilo under Ubuntu
[03:11] <guest_> howtoforge seems to be down?
[03:11] <_Omega> Who needs to use lilo in ubuntu & why?
[03:11] <K^Holtz> Whats a good BitTorrent client that has a GUI? I've had nothing but problems with Azureus.
[03:11] <_Omega> I can't in almost any circumstance reccomend Lilo.
[03:12] <Jager> H3g3m0n: well, heres the result from geometry(hd0) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34031/
[03:12] <guest_> Run utorrent in win holtz
[03:12] <_Omega> K^Holtz: Azureus (spelling)
[03:12] <plesnivyjano> is it normal i cant change ownership of file to someone else?? Operation not permitted . I have to do it through sudo
[03:12] <guest_> I just asked that questions recently
[03:12] <_Omega> Azereus?  Can't remember.
[03:12] <wmoxam> um, why does ubuntu's pkg manager install postgres binaries under /usr/lib ?
[03:12] <K^Holtz> _Omega: Isnt that exactly how i spelled it?
[03:12] <wmoxam> it seems oddly bizarre
[03:12] <_Omega> Sorry.
[03:12] <_Omega> I was reccomending it. :(
[03:12] <guest_> I need to install mysql on a linux box, where do I start?
[03:13] <_Omega> I didn't see that at the end of the line.
[03:13] <H3g3m0n> K^Holtz: Theres rufus torrent, theres a webbased one called fluxtorrent, it depends on how many advanced features you need
[03:13] <_Omega> If you're having troubles with Azureuseses, you may be outta luck.
[03:13] <cafuego_> guest_: sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
[03:13] <_Omega> Although the good news is, if you CAN get it working, it's by far one of the most popular clients out there....
[03:13] <guest_> All one line?
[03:13] <K^Holtz> _Omega: the community says its a Edgy bug
[03:13] <guest_> That is sweet
[03:13] <cafuego_> guest_: yup
[03:13] <Jager> Azureus ftw
[03:14] <_Omega> K^Holtz: Egh.  Those are bound to happen ;)  I'm still on dapper.
[03:14] <moyote> Is downloading with bittorrent generally slower?
[03:14] <wmoxam> *sigh*
[03:14] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Thats even odder, it lists your primary hdd as sda :/
[03:14] <_Omega> moyote: I find it to be reliable.
[03:14] <burner> torrents are fast for me
[03:14] <cafuego_> moyote: not if the torrent has enough seeders.
[03:14] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Does cfdisk /dev/sda, show an ntfs partition?
[03:14] <K^Holtz> _Omega: while those are bound to happen they should be fixed quickly
[03:14] <moyote> okapi, thanks
[03:14] <Jager> H3g3m0n: :( My crazy computer
[03:14] <moyote> ok
[03:15] <Jager> H3g3m0n: cfdisk?
[03:15] <cafuego_> H3g3m0n: That's perfectly normal for SATA drives.
[03:15] <H3g3m0n> cafuego: His mount lists his root partition as /dev/hdb2
[03:15] <moyote> cafuego, what do you use for bittorrent(software)?
[03:15] <cafuego_> H3g3m0n: <heh> That's a bit special, then.
[03:15] <H3g3m0n> Jager: 'cfdisk /dev/sda'

[03:16] <guest_> H3 what does that do?
[03:16] <dramz> Good day, I've installed Ubuntu v6.10, and use Option "XkbLayout" "no" in xorg.conf. I've installed automatix2 and XGL/Compiz, but now I've got a english layout of my keyboard. I followed the guide on ubuntuguide.org when installing automix2 and XGL/Compiz. I've checked that there is no more than one instance of "XkbLayout" in xorg.conf, and that it is in fact /etc/X11/xorg.conf that's being used.. Any other suggestions to why I can't get t
[03:17] <Arrick> is there a UPS daemon for edgy?
[03:17] <H3g3m0n> guest_: Its a partition editor
[03:17] <Jager> H3g3m0n: okay
[03:17] <H3g3m0n> Like gparted but in a console and it won't create filesystems for you, just the partitions
[03:17] <guest_> I see, so sudo cfdisk /dev/sda allows you to edit the partitions on that disk
[03:17] <guest_> You can't resize partitions can you?
[03:17] <enotee> where do i go to past large error messages?
[03:17] <_Omega> cdfisk is really nice
[03:17] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Does it show sda1, sda2 etc?
[03:17] <guest_> will it do the work for you?
[03:18] <K^Holtz> What do u guys think of BitTornado?
[03:18] <H3g3m0n> guest_: No its fairly lo level, use gparted for anything more complex
[03:18] <VigoFusion> !automatix
[03:18] <Jager> H3g3m0n: sda1 and sda5
[03:18] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[03:18] <_Omega> K^Holtz: Never used it.
[03:18] <H3g3m0n> Jager: What filesystems does it show for em?
[03:18] <guest_> Ok, I've heard about gparted
[03:18] <guest_> Apparently it also resizes ntfs partitions
[03:18] <Arrick> can someone tell me if there is a UPS daemon for edgy?
[03:18] <guest_> That is super impressive
[03:19] <guest_> I would never do it without a backup, but I've heard very good things about gparted
[03:19] <_Omega> Yeah, resizing NTFS is a very important feature these days.  ESP considering there are lots of companies out there that want to charge money for it!
[03:19] <VigoFusion> gparted my NTFS,FAT32 and resized a swap all in one install.
[03:19] <guest_> no kidding
[03:19] <enotee> which html editor do you guys recommend
[03:19] <H3g3m0n> guest_: yep, although its a bit pedantic about minor problems. Need to make sure you exit windows properly and having a fragmented drive can cause it to bail but i havn't had it loose data
[03:19] <guest_> That's great
[03:20] <Jager> H3g3m0n: for sda1 NTFS for sda5 Linux Swap / Solaris

[03:20] <guest_> Actually talk about companies charging money for things that are free
[03:20] <_Omega> AnthonyG: More friendly to connections than gentoo?  Yes.  Perfect? No.
[03:21] <guest_> Have any of you tried ghost for linux
[03:21] <Jager> H3g3m0n: I guess O_o
[03:21] <Arrick> can someone tell me if there is a UPS daemon for edgy?

[03:21] <waldo> nothing shows up in the system monitor either
[03:21] <Jager> H3gem0n: both?
[03:21] <AnthonyG> _Omega: I see , What do you mean by perfect? 56K itself is flawed :D
[03:22] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Well, obviously certain things that most people on broadband these days do are gonna be slower on 56K
[03:22] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  But ubuntu doesn't compile sources like Gentoo does.
[03:22] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Just hdb
[03:22] <_Omega> AnthonyG: And because of that, downloads will be smaller.
[03:22] <Jager> h3gem0n: for sudo cfdisk /dev/hda I get "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"

[03:22] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Are you sure you don't have another harddrive or a usb drive plugged in
[03:22] <AnthonyG> _Omega: That's a given , But is there any Ubuntu-specific task that may be painful for me ?
[03:22] <H3g3m0n> CoRnJuLiOx: He doesn't have a hda
[03:23] <_Omega> AnthonyG: But keep in mind that ubuntu also installs a lot of packages, where gentoo actually can trim the fat....in a forward-only way.
[03:23] <CoRnJuLiOx> ahh i see.
[03:23] <Jager> H3g3m0n: My external was just in :/
[03:23] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Surprisingly, no.
[03:23] <Madpilot> ivx, they will show in synaptic
[03:23] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  Most of my updates go even faster than I'd expect.  Just keep yourself in a situation where you're not having to miss updates and you won't get swarmed.
[03:23] <cyberfall> hello all
[03:23] <ivx> madpilot okay soon as i figure out how to unlock my computer i can do that
[03:23] <AnthonyG> _Omega: This is good to hear :D.
[03:23] <waldo> anyone know how why mplayer wont run in edgy after doing a completely clean install
[03:23] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Because it looks like you have Linux on /dev/hdb, and windows+swapspace on /dev/sda
[03:23] <cyberfall> did some looking around and im at a lost
[03:23] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Now there are 3
[03:23] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Also remember that Linux is better with incremental patches, it won't make you upgrade THROUGH each version, it'll just give you the latest.
[03:24] <H3g3m0n> Jager: In hdb?
[03:24] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Even better :)
[03:24] <cyberfall> waldo vlc is a better then mplayer
[03:24] <guest_> IVX, if you need ot remove the kernels to boot off of, go to /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:24] <_Omega> AnthonyG: But anything will do that ;)
[03:24] <_Omega> AnthonyG: 'cept Windows.
[03:24] <waldo> cyberfall, but im writing a program that uses mplayer as a backend
[03:24] <Arrick> noone has information? nice, about typical lately.
[03:24] <Jager> H3gem0n: hda1 hda2 and hda5, and they go NTFS, Linux ext3, Linux swap / Solaris
[03:24] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Exactly XD
[03:24] <waldo> so i need mplayer to work
[03:24] <waldo> again
[03:24] <Jager> h3gem0n: yes in hdb
[03:24] <cyberfall> anyone back to my question how do i setup raid in ubuntu i cant find a site to help
[03:25] <linux_kid> waldo vlc player is better in every aspect!
[03:25] <guest_> Arrick what d oyou need info on
[03:25] <_Omega> Arrick:  Look up UPS for upstart.
[03:25] <guest_> it's crazy chaotic in here
[03:25] <AnthonyG> _Omega: What about resources? Am I going to need a Vista-Power machine with a DX10 Next-Gen shader card to run smoothly?
[03:25] <guest_> it's hard to follow up with all the questions
[03:25] <waldo> linux_kid, thanks... but i need to have mplayer working
[03:25] <cyberfall> in disk it shows both hard drives as hde and hdf
[03:25] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Absolutely not.
[03:25] <_Omega> AnthonyG: you can try xubuntu, I reccomend it for a stripped down experience.
[03:25] <linux_kid> waldo: whats wrong with your mplayer?
[03:25] <waldo> when i try to run it
[03:25] <waldo> nothing happens
[03:26] <cyberfall> waldo i when with vlc cause i couldnt get xvid to work in mplayer
[03:26] <linux_kid> that stinks
[03:26] <guest_> How do I hack Firefox so that mms:// links open up a vlc ?
[03:26] <waldo> linux_kid,  from menu or from terminal... nothing happens
[03:26] <AnthonyG> _Omega: I'd like to stick to Ubuntu , What would you say to 256MB RAM , ATI Radeon 200 , 1.7 GHz?
[03:26] <_Omega> AnthonyG: You're fine.
[03:26] <ivx> will ubuntu lock you out if you type your password in wrong to many times?
[03:26] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Configure about 100MB of swap space.
[03:26] <waldo> guest    try editing  about:config
[03:27] <linux_kid> waldo: call me captian obvious, but try a reinstall through synaptic
[03:27] <guest_> By default, good question ivx
[03:27] <waldo> guest, type that into firefox as the url
[03:27] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Great , Thank you for the help :D
[03:27] <waldo> linux_kid, i did
[03:27] <guest_> Will VLC handle mms:// links waldo?
[03:27] <cafuego_> Okay, Captain Obvious.
[03:27] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  I used to run gentoo.
[03:27] <linux_kid> thank cafuego_
[03:27] <waldo> no idea  but thats where id look first
[03:27] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Ubuntu has one nice feature:  Doesn't break your configs!!!!!  Gentoo hasn't got that handled yet.  :(
[03:27] <waldo> after i remove a package... how to i purge the package?
[03:27] <guest_> k ty
[03:27] <ivx> guest_ how can i turn this off, i think i got it reset now, but i don't want to do it again
[03:28] <AnthonyG> _Omega: If only I could , But the 56K support kills me :(
[03:28] <_Omega> AnthonyG: I can totally understand your problem there.
[03:28] <_Omega> AnthonyG: A running ubuntu system can be left to do updates and it hardly chokes your system up.
[03:28] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Unlike the XP Live update or whatever it's called correct?
[03:28] <_Omega> AnthonyG: So if worst comes to worst, you can download updates, and once they're pulled over, they'll be applied nice & quickly.  Instead of Gentoo that breaks it down a lil' too much.
[03:28] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Ubuntu's updater works similar to that.
[03:29] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Can you pastebin the cfdisk output, for /dev/sda and /dev/hdb
[03:29] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  But the updates aren't nearly as big and clumsy.
[03:29] <AnthonyG> _Omega: But without the slowdown
[03:29] <Jager> H3g3m0n: alright
[03:29] <H3g3m0n> Jager: The entire terminal window
[03:29] <cyberfall> anyone know how to install an raid into ubuntu that already up and running
[03:29] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  Remember, Ubuntu is made for all situations.  And one of them is yours.
[03:29] <Jager> H3g3m0n: would screenshots be better?
[03:29] <waldo> after i remove a package... how to i totally clean the package off the computer?
[03:29] <_Omega> cyberfall:  What kind of raid?
[03:30] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Eithers fine
[03:30] <linux_kid> waldo: depends on the package
[03:30] <AnthonyG> _Omega: I feel so important :)
[03:30] <guest_> How do I connect to this server using Irssi?
[03:30] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Distros made for poor fools like myself :D
[03:30] <cafuego_> guest_: type '/server irc.freenode.net' in irssi.
[03:30] <_Omega> AnthonyG: For anyone.
[03:30] <burner> guest_: /server irc.freenode.net    then  /join #ubuntu
[03:30] <bronze>  irssi -c irc.freenode.net
[03:30] <Vaske_Car> waldo, I think you should install and remove packages with "aptitude" instead of "apt-get" in order to be able to perfomr complete uninstall.
[03:30] <cyberfall> stripping
[03:31] <cyberfall> i bet i spelt that wrong sorry
[03:31] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Hardware?  Software?  Existing data?
[03:31] <waldo> Vaske_Car, thanks
[03:31] <cyberfall> i have it set in hardware
[03:31] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Does it come with required hardware drivers?
[03:31] <cyberfall> no existing data
[03:31] <cyberfall> no format or partion eather
[03:31] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  I know dapper drake comes with the open drivers for ATI & NVidia.
[03:31] <_Omega> AnthonyG: Newer closed source, you'd have to download.
[03:32] <cafuego_> cyberfall: Define "hardware".
[03:32] <ivx> if i am going to uninstall old kernels should i do complete removal or just removal
[03:32] <AnthonyG> _Omega: And Edgy Eft?
[03:32] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Have you configured teh stripe?
[03:32] <cafuego_> ivx: complete removal.
[03:32] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  I haven't run a copy of it yet.  But I know there were some changes recently.  It's political.
[03:32] <cyberfall> i have an iwill kk-266 +R so it has an on board not the high point but linux say it a CM
[03:32] <Kud0s|sleepytime> !runlevel
[03:32] <guest_> Cafuega, I believe it's working, it's trying to connect
[03:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about runlevel - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:32] <hikenboot> anyone have a solution for hotplug udev not renumbering ethernet interfaces eth0 is not present doesnt show with ifconfig -a but is like an empty hole...there is no physical nic anymore...any ideas?
[03:32] <Kud0s|sleepytime> !init
[03:32] <ubotu> Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto
[03:33] <cafuego_> cyberfall: if it's an on-mainboard raid, don't use its raid bios; use the in-kernel raid drivers.
[03:33] <DARKGuy> Greetings! I have a small question... what's the best and safest way to burn a CD? I downloaded a Xubuntu ISO and I only have two blank CD-Rs, since I had some bad past experiences burning CDs before, I'd like to get some support first from the people who know ;) (I have GnomeBaker if you're wondering)
[03:33] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Politicians always pin down the open source community unfortunately :(
[03:33] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Configuring the striping of the drives should be part of your hardware's setup guides.
[03:33] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  Well, it's more licencing.
[03:33] <Staz> How can I grep a string/variable rather than a file?
[03:33] <Kud0s|sleepytime> How do i see my current runlevel?
[03:33] <naitmer> anynone any idea what a Link To Old Desktop is? with a .migrated fiel in it
[03:33] <co_15th> three
[03:33] <Vaske_Car> waldo, read this http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/aptitude
[03:33] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Once that is done, you should be able to address the physical drives as one logical drive.
[03:33] <cyberfall> well the bios only give u option of what u are doing
[03:33] <sid> What port and I supposed to forward for the built in bittorrent client for edgy/gnome. So my speeds increase(up and down)
[03:33] <cafuego_> Kud0s|sleepytime: echo 2
[03:33] <Jager> H3g3m0n: http://tinypic.com/view/?pic=40acmdl  <-- HDA  http://tinypic.com/view/?pic=2i6yzrp  <-- HDB
[03:34] <Kud0s|sleepytime> ta
[03:34] <_Omega> cyberfall:  yeah, raids aren't always the best, especially ones built into motherboards or "added on" by MOBO manufacturers.
[03:34] <waldo> thanks Vaske_Car
[03:34] <dabaR> Kud0s|sleepytime: run runlevel
[03:34] <linux_kid> DARKGuy: burn the cd in that horrible yet reliable os called windoze
[03:34] <cyberfall> well it built in
[03:34] <Kud0s|sleepytime> ?!
[03:34] <AnthonyG> _Omega: Thank you for the assistance, I think the manual can take over from here :)
[03:34] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Do you have THAT set up?
[03:34] <_Omega> AnthonyG:  Your welcome!  Enjoy.  Stick with it!
[03:34] <manmadha> how to do php programs in linux?
[03:34] <cafuego_> Kud0s|sleepytime: seriosuly though `runlevel'.
[03:34] <bariel> what is the different between en_AU.UTF-8, en_BW.UTF-8 etc?
[03:34] <cyberfall> i have it set for both drive to be striped
[03:35] <Kud0s|sleepytime> thanks
[03:35] <DARKGuy> linux_kid, Aw :( so burning in Linux is still not-so-safe and prone to burning a CD the wrong way ):?
[03:35] <jar`> hi im having some problems, somehow my login screen changed and I have no icons for shutdown/restart
[03:35] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Okay, well then you should be able to see the drives as "sdxx"
[03:35] <_Omega> cyberfall:  Linux will recognize the drives as ONE.
[03:35] <cyberfall> in what df
[03:35] <cyberfall> or mount
[03:35] <cafuego_> cyberfall: If you cvna tell the bios to not be raid, but just normal IDE or SATA, you should be able to sue them in Linux to configure via 'mdadm'.
[03:35] <sid> Anyone know what port the built-in bittorrent client for edgy/ubuntu needs forwarded?
[03:35] <linux_kid> DARKGuy: if you want somthing to be perfect (and have someone by the name of gates to complian to if it isn't) use windows
[03:35] <VigoFusion> (II) RADEON(0): Not using mode "1024x768" (no mode of this name)   and that means I am making progress?
[03:35] <cafuego_> cyberfall: In event of failure or new hardware, you'll still be able to use them. With on-mobo raid that's doubtful.
[03:36] <baris_> hello
[03:36] <H3g3m0n> Jager: for sda not hda
[03:36] <_Omega> cyberfall:  type cat /proc/diskstats
[03:36] <_Omega> Cyberfall: might give you some info
[03:36] <linux_kid> baris_, hi
[03:36] <VanessaE> Got a question.. of the showstopper variety
[03:36] <cyberfall> well what i have is pare of 2 x 20s
[03:36] <Jager> H3g3m0n: my bad, ill do it again
[03:36] <ivx> cafuego_ thanks
[03:36] <dabaR> VanessaE: good announcement
[03:36] <cafuego_> cyberfall: And keep in mind striping (raid0) means all data is lost when one of the disks fails.
[03:36] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Although now it does look like its all on hdb
[03:36] <cyberfall> and i want to stripe them into being a 40
[03:37] <linux_kid> VanessaE, whats your question?
[03:37] <DARKGuy> heh, alright, thanks linux_kid :P
[03:37] <cyberfall> ya that fine if i lose what i put on them
[03:37] <cafuego_> cyberfall: So that it is a bigger disk?
[03:37] <VanessaE> using the edgy build of X along with a kernel I built, and the 'official' nvidia drivers...   I'm having a problem with X crashing before it even brings up the nvidia logo
[03:37] <VanessaE> ..but...
[03:37] <cyberfall> cafuego,  yep
[03:37] <Jager> H3g3m0n: stil; want sda?
[03:37] <cafuego_> cyberfall: Not just a speed issue? Then maybe use LVM and not raid.
[03:37] <_Omega> cafeuego_: He just wants to use his hardware raid capability.
[03:37] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh problaly best
[03:37] <VanessaE> it started happening after I added the drivers to the kernel that are needed to use a DC10+ card.
[03:37] <cyberfall> _Omega,  that also
[03:37] <_Omega> cafuego_:  LVM might be a bit overkill & complicated for this.
[03:38] <VanessaE> if I load those modules *after* X starts, everything works fine, but if I load them *before*, X locks up before it even gives the logo.
[03:38] <guest_> why the underscore after the username i wonder
[03:38] <_Omega> cafuego_:  Considering most MOBOs come with some ghetto-raid....He's better off getting that working because it means less linux-legwork.
[03:38] <CoRnJuLiOx> how do you kill x so i can install the nvidia drivers
[03:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Assuming its not another cannot open drive error
[03:38] <cafuego_> _Omega: No harder to set up than dmraid I should think.
[03:38] <coldfire> just stopping by to ask if anyone else has problems with the flash plugin for mozilla?
[03:38] <Jager> Heg3m0n: sudo cfdisk /dev/hda ?
[03:38] <VanessaE> any clues to what would do this?
[03:38] <VigoFusion> VanessE: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=255929 <<<did you look at that?
[03:38] <cyberfall> i though if just set the bois for raid and linux would of seen it as one drive and let me format and off i be
[03:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: sda not hda
[03:38] <Jager> sudo cfdisk /dev/sda **(
[03:38] <H3g3m0n> yeh
[03:38] <cyberfall> butdont seem like it will take it
[03:38] <linux_kid> coldfire: you have to download it from adobe's website
[03:38] <coldfire> i have it installed, and firefox recognizes the plugin, but i can't view any flash content
[03:38] <Arrick> I need to apologize to this channel, it has been brought to my attention that I just made a comment (my bad mistake) that I would have taken offence to in other channels. My apologies to this channel. I hope no hard feelings are kept over my last statement.
[03:38] <_Omega> cafeugo_:  Hardware raid is very easy to set up.
[03:38] <cafuego_> _Omega: Well, the ghettoraid problem is that if his mobo fails, he prolly won't be able to get at the data on a new mobo.
[03:38] <VanessaE> lemme check, vigo .. I've been all over the web with no solution..
[03:38] <VanessaE> (so far that is)
[03:38] <RebornDV> hello
[03:38] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Same result as hda
[03:38] <Jager> H3g3m0n: FATAL ERROR
[03:38] <linux_kid> coldfire: what happens when you try to view a youtube video?
[03:38] <_Omega> cafuego_:  Oh yeah, LVM shines there ;)
[03:39] <cyberfall> last time i played in lvm i kinda messed up but i was playin with an active partion
[03:39] <H3g3m0n> Jager: hmm, did you remove the external drive?
[03:39] <Jager> H3g3m0n: yes
[03:39] <cafuego_> _Omega: It's most likely software raid, not hardware. Even though it's on the mobo. (brings pain)
[03:39] <H3g3m0n> Jager: ok
[03:39] <cyberfall> but i dont see sdxx
[03:39] <cyberfall> i see hde and hdf
[03:39] <naitmer> !ubotu .migrated
[03:39] <cafuego_> _Omega: You still need to configure Linux to see and use the "raid" array.
[03:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about migrated - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:39] <cyberfall> no hdex
[03:39] <RebornDV> i have what i hope to be an easy to solve problem... i have a file server where i keep my music and videos... i would like to be able to play them on this laptop with ubuntu without copying the files over... is this possible? and if so what program/s will do it?
[03:39] <cyberfall> or hdfx
[03:39] <bariel> how can i change the locala for my system? atm it is en_AU-UTF-8, i want to change it to en_US-UTF-8
[03:39] <H3g3m0n> Jager: It looks like grub was detecting the external as (hd0)
[03:39] <coldfire> linux_kid: whoa .. looks like it is working after all
[03:39] <_Omega> cafuego_:  Yeah....Could be.  I like hardware ones that just show up as ONE DRIVE. :)
[03:39] <linux_kid> coldfire: awsome!
[03:40] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Try 'sudo grub' and then 'geometry (hd0)' again
[03:40] <_Omega> cafuego_:  Call it a "winraid" like a "winmodem" ;)
[03:40] <cafuego_> cyberfall: hde and hdf? That's IDE drives #5 and #5.
[03:40] <guest_> I love this channel
[03:40] <VanessaE> vigo: ok...reading, but I don't quite understand what this has to do with the problem I'm seeing (other than being unsupported by the ubuntu team anyway)
[03:40] <cafuego_> _Omega: indeed
[03:40] <coldfire> linux_kid: i guess the sites i frequent have poor checks to see if the plugin is installed ... until you pointed out that 'youtube' utilizes flash, i've seen nothing but the "Get Flash" links
[03:40] <cyberfall> ya ide not sata
[03:40] <cafuego_> cyberfall: #5 and #6 even - those will be your 20GB drives.
[03:40] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port?
[03:40] <cyberfall> or scsi
[03:40] <cyberfall> yes
[03:40] <VanessaE> I might point out, btw., if I switch to the regular "nv" driver in my X config, there's no crash/conflict.
[03:40] <VanessaE> (and even the DC10+ works..)
[03:40] <_Omega> cafuego_: If he has 2 20GB drives, it's configured wrong.  It should show up as one 40GB drive.
[03:40] <bariel> anyone?
[03:40] <cyberfall> #1 and #2 is the main
[03:41] <guest_> Vanessa, try removing the 'splash' instance on /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:41] <hikenboot> ask this a different way whats the ubuntu equivalent to #  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
[03:41] <Jager> H3g3m0n: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34035/
[03:41] <linux_kid> coldfire: if possible, try a different browser or a newer version of flash, good luck
[03:41] <_Omega> cafuego_: unless that's just recognizing the HDD's hardware, and not the logical structure.
[03:41] <guest_> Gets rid of the splash screen
[03:41] <cafuego_> coldfire: They may be using flash8 or flash9 and you probably have flash 7.
[03:41] <VanessaE> guest: I'm not using Grub.  I use lilo.
[03:41] <cyberfall> _Omega,  ya but in ubuntu it see them 2 drive
[03:41] <guest_> Sometimes the splash screen doesn't play too well with the nivida drivers
[03:41] <_Omega> cyberfall:  That may mean your raid is configured incorrectly.
[03:41] <RebornDV> i have what i hope to be an easy to solve problem... i have a file server where i keep my music and videos... i would like to be able to play them on this laptop with ubuntu without copying the files over... is this possible? and if so what program/s will do it?
[03:41] <cyberfall> that not a suprise then
[03:41] <coldfire> cafuego_: ahh ... no workaround for something like that i don't suppose
[03:41] <guest_> Ok, I'm not sure how to remove the splash screen instance on LILO, but it should be about the ame
[03:41] <guest_> same
[03:41] <_Omega> cyberfall:  cafuego_ and myself are presenting two possible scenarios.  You should check with your MOBO manuals & hardware really.
[03:41] <cafuego_> _Omega: Linux pretty much supports _none_ of the on-mobo raid chips in raid mode.
[03:41] <coldfire> linux_kid: will do, thanks
[03:41] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port
[03:42] <VanessaE> there isn't one on mine...text mode all the way until X starts.
[03:42] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Ok, i think if you reboot without the external drive plugged in windows should load if grub still has it set to hd(0,0)
[03:42] <guest_> Reborn you can stream them
[03:42] <cyberfall> well it dont show for linux
[03:42] <cyberfall> just winblows
[03:42] <cafuego_> _Omega: Mainly because in-kernel raid is both faster and far more reliable :-)
[03:42] <guest_> Go to winamp.com and instal lthe streaming server on your computer
[03:42] <_Omega> cafuego_:  That depends on how they present themselves in the resulting bios.
[03:42] <guest_> then run the client on your goobuntu obx
[03:42] <Kevin`> most of the on-mobo raid chips are really software raid
[03:42] <Kevin`> ie crap :)
[03:42] <guest_> I've done this on windows but not on linux, but yes you can stream them
[03:42] <bobbie__4> all hail the arrival of Bobbie
[03:42] <RebornDV> guest_: and that will allow me to choose what to play on the client?
=== cO_17_cr_tmn is now known as dea_cwek
[03:43] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port???
[03:43] <cafuego_> coldfire: Well, you could install flash9.
[03:43] <dea_cwek> #surabaya
[03:43] <coldfire> cafuego_: i didn't see a download for anything newer than 7 on macro's website .. i'll check again
[03:43] <guest_> Hmm...reborn you'll have ot set up seprate sreaming playlists I believe
[03:43] <guest_> so I don't think you can get that kind of granularity
[03:43] <cafuego_> coldfire: There is a beta, check seveas.ubuntulinux.nl
[03:43] <_Omega> cyberfall:  This may require some research on your part.  I wouldn't go into a raid without a 100% game plan sorted out, even if you don't plan on holding critical information on it.  It can be a PITA.
[03:43] <guest_> But who knows maybe you can
[03:43] <linux_kid> coldfire: ya, i think v8 only works on windows, sorry
[03:44] <RebornDV> guest_: drats... i was hoping i could just double click the files through the network like i can with my windows box
[03:44] <Jager> H3g3m0n: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34036/
[03:44] <Shinoda> coldfire http://labs.adobe.com/
[03:44] <guest_> Reborn, I'm sure you can, I just dont know how to do it
[03:44] <VigoFusion> I got alotta text, use pastebin and then ask for help?
[03:44] <Jager> Should I only worry about line 148?
[03:44] <NoStop> RebornDV: why not just setup a samba server on box that has the media?
[03:44] <linux_kid> RebornDV: does the server come up in Places->Network Servers->Windows Network ?
[03:45] <RebornDV> linux_kid: yeah it does
[03:45] <RebornDV> wait
[03:45] <coldfire> Shinoda: ahh, excellent .. thanks for pointing that out
[03:45] <NoStop> RebornDV: and then share the directories that contain media?
[03:45] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port
[03:45] <Shinoda> np
[03:45] <nickv111> Hey. I have libdvdread3 installed, and yet, I can't use mplayer to play a DVD. It just freezes on "DVD successfully opened." Xine says it can't open it (libdvdread support is, for some reason missing)
[03:45] <RebornDV> linux_kid: just shws up under network servers
[03:45] <linux_kid> RebornDV: can you see the files?
[03:45] <dea_cwek> #u buntu
[03:46] <RebornDV> i can copy the files over and play them
[03:46] <H3g3m0n> Jager: yeh looks good, try a reboot without the extra drive. Its just when you had that plugged in it became (hd0), so windows was trying to boot off that
[03:46] <RebornDV> linux_kid: i can see them fine
[03:46] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Also you might have added linux swap space to it accidently at some point :/
[03:46] <linux_kid> RebornDV: i recommend vcl media player
[03:46] <Jager> h3g3m0n: to the external? O_o
[03:46] <RebornDV> vlc?
[03:46] <linux_kid> ya, sorry
[03:47] <RebornDV> o ok
[03:47] <RebornDV> let me check
[03:47] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Okay, Im going to restart and try to boot into windows.
[03:47] <RebornDV> do have it installed
[03:47] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh, thats what the grub geometry was saying when you did it the first time with it plugged in
[03:47] <VanessaE> VigoFusion, I'm still reading this thread you pointed me to, but I'm lost..
[03:47] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port????????????????/////
[03:48] <redDEADresolve> if i have an ati x1600 video card can i run aiglx
[03:48] <RebornDV> linux_kid: when i do that vlc starts but nothing happens... same as xmms banshee beep and totem
[03:48] <VanessaE> Oh I forgot to say, when X crashes, the screen stays black.  I have to Alt-SysRq-K to get back to a text console, and I could see in the proces list, X is d-stated.
[03:49] <guest_> If you put one more questions mark I might answer at the end you might get an answer.
[03:49] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and noticed that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port
[03:49] <linux_kid> RebornDV: does it startup at all?
[03:49] <guest_> wceoscar, can you ping www.google.com ?
[03:49] <DevC> how do I find out what version of Ubuntu I have now on my desktop, so i can upgrade some more if need b
[03:49] <RebornDV> linux_kid: yeah the programs start... but none of the media will play unless i copy them locally
[03:49] <wceoscar> of course i can acces gooooooooooogle
[03:49] <guest_> devc:  cat /etc/lsb-release
=== cO_17_cr_tmn is now known as dea_SMP
[03:50] <linux_kid> RebornDV: well.... let me try really quick on my machine
[03:50] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Nope :(
[03:50] <Jager> H3g3m0n:
[03:51] <H3g3m0n> hmm :/
[03:51] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Still sits there saying "starting up...."
[03:51] <Gradius9> hi
[03:51] <Jager> it showed go right past the Starting Up... part quicky right
[03:51] <Jager> no matter how slow windows is
[03:51] <H3g3m0n> yeh
[03:51] <linux_kid> DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW THE DIRECTORY TO NETWORK SERVERS FROM "/"
[03:52] <wceoscar> gest, of course i can ping google!!!!
[03:52] <Jager> >_<
[03:52] <bobbie__4> Linux Rocks!
[03:52] <Kevin`> linux_kid sounds confused :)
[03:52] <Jager> I really really hope it didnt get messed up
[03:52] <diskus> linux_kid: I don't think there is by default
[03:52] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Might be worth trying lilo i guess
[03:52] <Kevin`> linux_kid the command 'mount' would show you the path, if any are in the filesystem
[03:52] <Jager> although I can go on the ntfs partition and take my data off...
[03:52] <Jager> okay
[03:52] <stefano> ubuntu...wow!!!
[03:53] <KanRiNiN> Hey, is there no way to uninstall rhythmbox without the gnome and ubuntu-desktop using synaptic?
[03:53] <diskus> mount and df
[03:53] <KanRiNiN> I'm replacing it with MPD and banshee
[03:53] <Jager> !lilo
[03:53] <ubotu> lilo is an alternative [Li] nux Boot[Lo] ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.
[03:53] <stefano> using vlc
[03:53] <Jager> Bah no link to lilo from ubotu..
[03:53] <diskus> lilo was so easy to use :P
[03:53] <linux_kid> RebornDV: I got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[03:53] <Gradius9> highneko, is it possible now to convert volumes from ntfs to ext3?
[03:54] <Kevin`> lilo doesn't have a command line or filesystem knowledge, grub++
[03:54] <RebornDV> linux_kid: woo hoo
[03:54] <RebornDV> linux_kid: i hope i can get it too
[03:54] <KanRiNiN> Thanks in advance for whoever helps
[03:54] <DevC> says 5.04 but the upgrade said id downloaded the newer version.....so how do I install them so that it is the newer version? thought they downloaded and installed themselves
[03:54] <Gradius9> without deleting stuff of course
[03:54] <Kevin`> Gradius9 there would be an unavoidable loss of information doing that, as the metadata available is different
[03:55] <stefano> how to read DVD's?
[03:55] <linux_kid> RebornDV: open the windows network and then the name of your network.  Drag the server computer's icon to the desktop.  Open VCL, and then navigate to the desktop, click on the icon to the server, and find your files!!!!!!
[03:55] <Gradius9> Kevin`, yeah, but all the files are movies and such
[03:55] <Kevin`> stefano data or encrypted video
[03:55] <Jager> Would it be possible to just uninstall linux (i dont want to :( ) so that i could boot straight into windows like nothing happened?
[03:55] <RebornDV> linux_kid: sweet thanks
[03:55] <nickv111> I think I'm having some serious libdvdread errors. Every time I run ogle or xine, trying to play a DVD, I get errors regarding libdvdread
[03:55] <screechingcat> KanRiNiN: ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage. you can uninstall it and nothing will happen to your system
[03:55] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Not without a windows cd unfortunatly
[03:55] <nickv111> But I don't know why. I got it straight from the Edgy repository
[03:56] <linux_kid> RebornDV: you are very welcome!
[03:56] <stefano> encripted video
[03:56] <KanRiNiN> screechingcat: what's a metapackage?
[03:56] <Jager> H3g3m0n: I could download one... but would I need to format anything?
[03:56] <Kevin`> stefano you need libdvdcss, as well as a program like mplayer or xine or vlc to display it
[03:56] <ma12> Is it a bad idea to change a folder or file to a+w if I need access to it?
[03:56] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Nah you would need to goto the recovery console, and run fixmbr and maby fixboot
[03:57] <H3g3m0n> Jager: That assuming you didn't break it
[03:57] <stefano> Tes I try but the system don't work!
[03:57] <RebornDV> linux_kid: uhm... should it try to copy files overwhen i drag it to the desktop?
[03:57] <Kevin`> you shouldn't need to run fixboot
[03:57] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Hmm.. lemme go see if I can get my hands on a windows disk
[03:57] <Kevin`> and any dos/windows mbr will work
[03:57] <screechingcat> KanRiNiN: its a package that is not a peice of software by itself but depends on a lot of others. so if you install ubuntu-desktop, the package itself contains nothing. but it depends on all the packages of a normal ubuntu system.
[03:57] <VanessaE> sigh... I really hate corporations (i.e. nvidia and their precious closed source)
[03:57] <Kevin`> you could do fdisk /mbr from a win98 disk if you have one
[03:57] <linux_kid> RebornDV: all it does is creates a link.  If u dont want it on your desktop, put it in  your home folder
[03:57] <stefano> Kevin i use ppc system
[03:57] <Blenderer> hey all
[03:58] <Kevin`> stefano windows does not have a ppc port
[03:58] <nickv111> xine returns, "libdvdread: Encrypted DVD support unavailable." but I have libdvdread3 installed. I don't understand it
[03:58] <Kevin`> oh
[03:58] <Kevin`> wrong person
[03:58] <Kevin`> stefano that does not matter
[03:58] <Kevin`> at all :)
[03:58] <RebornDV> linux_kid: i must not have something installed right then... cos it tries to copy all of my files over
[03:58] <Gradius9> Kevin`, Which tools were you intentionally thinking about?
[03:58] <Kevin`> you need libdvdcss and the corresponding support in libdvdread
[03:58] <H3g3m0n> nickv111: You probally need libcss or libdecss aswell
[03:59] <H3g3m0n> !dvd
[03:59] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[03:59] <VanessaE> is there a way to completely disable I2C support in the nvidia driver?  I think that's where the problem lies.
[03:59] <ma12> Does anyone use Skype successfully on their 6.10??
[03:59] <screechingcat> ma12: me
[03:59] <Kevin`> Gradius9 since you are always doing a backup before such a risky conversion, I would format the disk and copy the backup data to it
[03:59] <cafuego_> nickv111: You need the "naughty" bit too, dvdcss
[03:59] <linux_kid> RebornDV: thats odd, all it did for me was make a link, or else 7 gigabites would be flooding my network
[03:59] <nickv111> H3g3m0n: Thank you very much
[03:59] <nickv111> Yeah, I thought libdvdread had libcss
[03:59] <stefano> I try to sonn thank
[03:59] <cafuego_> nickv111: There is a little script in /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/
[04:00] <cafuego_> nickv111: Nono, it isn't included, only a script to downlaod & install it,.
[04:00] <H3g3m0n> VanessaE: There was a custom patch for then when the 1st betas came out, you would need to compile the official nvidia drivers from source
[04:00] <VanessaE> figures.
[04:00] <RebornDV> linux_kid: i tried to do that right click drag trick... wouldn't do it
[04:00] <cafuego_> nickv111: 'sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh'
[04:00] <nickv111> cafuego_: Thank you
[04:00] <Kevin`> diff libcss libdvdcss?
[04:00] <Gradius9> Kevin`, yeah what I want, but I havent any free disks, all my backup disks are used for the real computer, this is just my file server with movies and such
[04:00] <ma12> screechingcat did you have to make any modifications?
[04:00] <VanessaE> can't back down to the previous version of the driver, it won't build against current kernels....and if I back down to a kernel it will build against, I lose SATA support..
[04:00] <ivx> hey what do i type to list my processor info?
[04:00] <nickv111> cafuego_: I used Debian awhile, and there was a similar script.
[04:00] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port
[04:01] <cafuego_> Kevin`: css = cascading stylesheets, dvdcss = dvd decryption.
[04:01] <ivx> isn't it /etc/init.d/cpuinfo
[04:01] <ma12> or did it work right out of the box for you screechingcat
[04:01] <stdundon> Hi, anybody have experience with both Gentoo and Ubuntu?
[04:01] <Kevin`> so libcss has no relation to dvds
[04:01] <cafuego_> nickv111: Yeah, same package :-)
[04:01] <linux_kid> RebornDV: just drag it normal holding left click and pull it to the desktop
[04:01] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: yeh
[04:01] <cafuego_> Kevin`: correct
[04:01] <Kevin`> k
[04:01] <cafuego_> ivx: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:01] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: How does upgrading in Ubuntu work out?
[04:02] <RebornDV> linux_kid: yeah i did that first and when that didn't work i tried the right click... then tried the regular again a couple more times
[04:02] <screechingcat> ma12: out of the box
[04:02] <ivx> cafuego_ that's it thanks!
[04:02] <Jager> Arg.. ive got to redoanlowd a windows disk...
[04:02] <linux_kid> RebornDV: how fresh is your install and are you dapper or edgy?
[04:02] <RebornDV> linux_kid: i installed dapper and did an update to edgy
[04:02] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: I know that they release every 6 months, but can you just do an 'emerge -auvD world' kind of thing?
[04:02] <Kevin`> Jager tsk tsk, using pirated windows
[04:02] <stefano> 'sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh and then
[04:02] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: Alot easier/faster than gentoo, although im not so sure about upgrading from one release version to another
[04:02] <Jager> kevin
[04:02] <Jager> Its just to repair my legal copy
[04:02] <CoRnJuLiOx> im suddenly not getting any sound from realplayer when i try to play this .rmvb file, but i had sound in the same file just the other night, other music files seem to play properly, though..
[04:03] <Kevin`> what's broken in it
[04:03] <nickv111> Hey, guys, this is interesting. I installed libcss using the script, but I still can't play DVDs
[04:03] <linux_kid> RebornDV: ok, im on dapper and just reinstalled about 45minutes ago
[04:03] <diskus> stefano: what I understand about ubuntu, you can't
[04:03] <nickv111> Same error
[04:03] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: You update your repositories (basicly emerge --sync) then use synaptic to update the newer packages
[04:03] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: but still as flexible?  If I can just upgrade all of my packages, I guess I don't care about what it's named
[04:03] <KanRiNiN> Hey guys.  I did a build-dep for gaim to compile w/ avahi and bonjour support.  can I clean up all the dev packages somehow?  e.g. perhaps there's a log file?
[04:03] <diskus> stefano: depends on realease
[04:03] <Jager> i cant boot into windows anymore.. so i need to run fixmbr and fixboot
[04:03] <RebornDV> linux_kid: thanks for the help... i might need to try a fresh edgy install
[04:03] <cafuego_> stefano: ... and then ... it's done.
[04:03] <Jager> then... *sniff* delete linux (and maybe reinstall it if i can do it right)
[04:03] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: great.  So, as a desktop you would recommend it over Gentoo?
[04:04] <Kevin`> Jager you can run the equivalent of fixmbr from any dos or windows boot disk, or even from linux
[04:04] <mga_mark> Hello. I have a question about Ubunto, and how it doesn't completely fill my screen. It's set for 1024, but it has a black bar around it, a lot of unused screen. I'm running it off a live disk. Anyone have any suggestions?
[04:04] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: (I'm already downloading the iso
[04:04] <linux_kid> RebornDV: dont risk all of your files unless you are really savy on hdd space
[04:04] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: Yeh, gentoos updating is rairly unstable and because its source it takes ages to compile
[04:04] <Firefishe> I'm on a g4 powerbook 15" aluminum 1ghz laptop, running ubuntu 6.06 dapper.  I just downloaded kubuntu-desktop, then most of what apt-get didn't get (like the kde core files, etc.), and I am experiencing a vexing problem starting kde.  Seems the file permissions in my /home/user directory can't be written to by kde.
[04:04] <Kevin`> I forget which little linux program does it though, as i've never needed to use it
[04:04] <linux_kid> RebornDV: sorry i couldn't be of service
[04:04] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: Gentoo does have alot of newer packages and its much more customizable
[04:04] <Jager-> I got killed by services? X(
[04:04] <Kevin`> Jager you can run the equivalent of fixmbr from any dos or windows boot disk, or even from linux
[04:04] <Kevin`> I forget which little linux program does it though, as i've never needed to use it
[04:04] <nickv111> stdundon: I used ot use Gentoo. I got tired of the complexity, and how it was a chore to use. Now, I use Kubuntu, and I'm very happy. (K)ubuntu is really great, simple, and user-friendly.
[04:05] <varsendaggr> hi, any help with fluxbox would be greatly appreciated :D
[04:05] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: very true.  My libraries got screwed up toady, b/c I had to use a 32bit chroot to install flash with firefox.  Now I'm ready for something new
[04:05] <stefano> bye!!
[04:05] <RebornDV> linux_kid: nah don't be... you helped as much as you could and at least proved it can be done
[04:05] <Jager-> I have my windows boot disk... problem is something is screwed up with it..
[04:05] <Jager-> ill go make another
[04:05] <Kevin`> Jager- why not just have grub/lilo boot windows
[04:05] <linux_kid> RebornDV: ya
[04:05] <mofturos> how can i make my movies to work .. apt-get install xine-ui ... it's not working ?
[04:05] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: sounds great.  Well, I'm off to watch Blade Runner while I d/l, but I thank you for your experience
[04:05] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: take care
[04:05] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: I recomend avoiding amd64 based Ubuntu, although i did manage to get flash running with nppluginwrapper
[04:05] <Jager-> Kevin` Its dieing when it tried to boot windows
[04:06] <H3g3m0n> stdundon: nps
[04:06] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: lol
[04:06] <Kevin`> that did you try to do, in grub
[04:06] <Jager-> Ive spent all day with h3g3m0n (very helpful) trying to fix it
[04:06] <linux_kid> mofturos: try "sudo apt-get install vlc"
[04:06] <Kevin`> root (hd0,whatevernumber)
[04:06] <Kevin`> chainloader +1
[04:06] <Kevin`> boot
[04:06] <Kevin`> should be all that's needed
[04:06] <mofturos> ok
[04:06] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: well, heck, I think it's recommended to avoid using a Linux desktop on amd64, no1 seems to do it well yet, but I'll give it a try
[04:06] <Kevin`> rootnoverify instead of root
[04:07] <Kevin`> but that doesn't matter when you enter it
[04:07] <cafuego_> stdundon: Well, only if you need or want video/java/flash
[04:07] <Jager-> Kevin` so... how can I fix grub to boot windows?
[04:07] <varsendaggr> hi, could someone please answer a few questions about fluxbox
[04:07] <Kevin`> Jager- show me your partition layout
[04:07] <slicky> ubotu radeon | slicky
[04:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about radeon - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:07] <sysdoc> HAs anyone figured out a workaround for the black window bug with nvidia/Beryl/Edgy?
[04:07] <Kevin`> varsendaggr ask a question and you might get an answer
[04:08] <varsendaggr> Kevin: lol thanks
[04:08] <stdundon> H3g3m0n: lol. exactly
[04:08] <Jager-> brb
[04:08] <mga_mark> Could anyone answer a screen question for me?
[04:08] <Gradius9> Kevin`, what method should I use if I want to be unsafe?
[04:08] <varsendaggr> So im new to ubuntu and i have been told about fluxbox by a friend... what exactly is it?
[04:08] <Kevin`> Gradius9 i'm not aware of one, you shouldn't do such a stupid thing :)
[04:08] <linux_kid> mga_mark, what's your question...
[04:09] <Kevin`> varsendaggr it's a window manager
[04:09] <mga_mark> I'm running Ubuntu from a dsik, and it doesn't fill my 1024 screen.
[04:09] <varsendaggr> Kevin: so do you boot up in it or what?
[04:09] <barata> hallo all, what app BEHAVES like iTunes? I need an app that can generate txt files (including ide3 tags) for my mp3 collection
[04:09] <Kevin`> varsendaggr it controls how windows work in X (the linux gui)
[04:09] <slicky> ubotu berly | slicky
[04:09] <linux_kid> mga_mark: so there are black lines around the screen?
[04:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about berly - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:09] <Kevin`> so you can switch between them, move them around, start programs, and stuff
[04:10] <Kevin`> fluxbox is generally considered a "light" window manager
[04:10] <mga_mark> Yes, though it says it's set for 1024.
[04:10] <Kevin`> I can give you a screenshot if you want :)
[04:10] <ToHellWithGA> i am getting gzip errors on the main edgy sources.  how can i fix that?
[04:10] <ali_> I am running warty, I just downloaded edgy. How do I install edgy from download?
[04:10] <dibblego> I am using ubuntu server 6.06; I suspect the machine has been compromised - now the network card fails to come up and executing a sudo command returns to the prompt immediately and does not do anything
[04:10] <linux_kid> what is ur windows resolution?
[04:10] <woro2006> hi, what's a good program to crawl through all my files so I can search them later?
[04:10] <highneko> How can I find where my swap is mounted on?
[04:10] <varsendaggr> Kevin: o, i see ... i got it from "synaptic package manager" and as i say im new to linux do you by chance know how to open it?
[04:10] <Kevin`> highneko swapon -s
[04:11] <plesnivyjano> why i cant change ownership of my own file ????
[04:11] <Kevin`> varsendaggr technically, the command fluxbox
[04:11] <highneko> Kevin`: Interesting. Thank you.
[04:11] <ivx> hey i have kernel 2.4.27-2-686-s installed, but when i boot that isn't listed. whats going on with that
[04:11] <mga_mark> hiighest, 32 bit
[04:11] <varsendaggr> Kevin: um... lol?
[04:11] <Firefishe> anyone here have any trouble with file permissions when using aptitude to install kubuntu-desktop from the standard ubuntu/gnome setup?
[04:11] <Kevin`> varsendaggr though, it will probably show up as an option in gpm
[04:11] <linux_kid> highneko: download gparted from synaptic and you will se it as a partition
[04:11] <Kevin`> when you log in
[04:11] <[erisco] > anyone know how to install GMP for PHP under Ubuntu?
[04:11] <Kevin`> gdm*
[04:11] <Kevin`> whatever
[04:11] <varsendaggr> Kevin: what is gpm?
[04:11] <wceoscar> HEy, i just got frostwire and notices that it doesnt conect to the network... what should be wrong??? port
[04:11] <Kevin`> gpm is a mouse driver for the console, gdm is what shows the login screen
[04:11] <Kevin`> I meant gdm
[04:11] <linux_kid> mga_mark: no, your resolution, like 1280x800...
[04:12] <slicky> hi.. i just reinstalled my ubuntu.. iv got a radeon 9600 xt ati card.. what drivers do you recomend?
[04:12] <mga_mark> It's 1024 by 7**
[04:13] <nickv111> mplayer is now spitting out, "libdvdread: Error cracking CSS key. . ." even though I have libdvdread3 and libdvdcss2 installed. This is really driving me insane.
[04:13] <[erisco] > I am talking about GMP though...
[04:13] <linux_kid> mga_mark: what video card do you have?
[04:13] <varsendaggr> Kevin: so is fluxbox a program that you open and modify or what?
[04:13] <H3g3m0n> nickv111: Tried a diffrent dvd?
[04:13] <mga_mark> I'm not sure. It's a Dell Pentium 4. It looks fine on Windows XP
=== stefano is now known as ChimeraHitman
[04:14] <ChimeraHitman> Hey guys?
[04:14] <Kevin`> varsendaggr it provides the look and behavior of desktop windows, like gnome or kde
[04:14] <VanessaE> there we go, problem solved.
[04:14] <__Gino__> I'm gonna ask this again, since there might be new people that know something ;)  (I already tried #ubuntu-xgl)
[04:14] <__Gino__>  Does anyone have problems resizing windows in Beryl (on Edgy) I've used it before, but I installe it on a new Edgy install and none of the windows can be resized....
[04:14] <linux_kid> mga_mark: any clue if it is an ATI or GEforce?
[04:14] <Kevin`> although gnome and kde have more they do, besides that
[04:14] <varsendaggr> Kevin:  sweet, so i start up my computer again and open it...? but how?
[04:14] <slicky> ubotu xgo | slicky
[04:14] <ChimeraHitman> I am having troubles getting Beryl to run on my gnome desktop. Ubuntu Edgy, nvidia-glx. No GLX server.
[04:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xgo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:14] <slicky> ubotu xgi | slicky
[04:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xgi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:14] <VanessaE> I was using the 9625 "beta" driver.  Updated to 9629 (which is marked as 'stable') and the problem went away.
[04:14] <nickv111> H3g3m0n: Just a second.
[04:14] <sysdoc> __Gino__, Beryl-settings-manager
[04:15] <mga_mark> Sorry. I'm not on that computer now, either. Is this an unsual probelm?
[04:15] <Kevin`> varsendaggr there should be a button or something when you log in, to choose the desktop environment to start
[04:15] <__Gino__> I tried that, it is enabled.
[04:15] <nickv111> H3g3m0n: See, mplayer returns a LOT of libdvdcss errors.
[04:15] <linux_kid> mga_mark: ok, lets assume it is an intel chip
[04:15] <mga_mark> It works fine, otherwise
[04:15] <mga_mark> Yes, definitely
[04:15] <Kevin`> I assume ubuntu would add it to that list..
[04:15] <ChimeraHitman> When i run the beryl-manager y just takes all the borders and gui and renders gnome useles.
[04:15] <VanessaE> (which is strange, I thought I'd already installed that update a week ago..no wonder the splash screen kept saying 'beta'...)
[04:15] <linux_kid> mga_mark: go to synaptic and download the package 915resolution after enabling universe reposotiries
[04:16] <nickv111> mplayer basically returns a lot of errors like, "libdvdread: CHECK_VALUE failed in ifo_read.c:1567"
[04:16] <nickv111> They're all pretty much the same, with the exception of the line number
[04:16] <blanky> you guys, I feel stupid, has anyone gotten the ati drivers to work on edgy?
[04:16] <varsendaggr> Kevin: well my comp. is partitioned btween ubuntu and windows xp so i chose ubuntu and it boots to the login screen... where would the button be in all that?
[04:16] <ChimeraHitman> Think anyone could help?
[04:16] <Kevin`> varsendaggr at the login screen somewhere
[04:16] <blanky> I read the tutorial and I feel like they wrote it just to trick me, I went into a trap and I knew it from the beginning
[04:16] <mga_mark> ok. Will it intefere with Windows?
[04:16] <nickv111> blanky: ati or fglrx?
[04:16] <Kevin`> mga_mark no
[04:16] <blanky> the drivers used to always work for me under breezy, but that's two versions ago
[04:16] <ChimeraHitman> I am using the nvidia-glx 8776 drivers.
[04:16] <linux_kid> mga_mark: no, not at all
[04:17] <blanky> nickv111: I believe fglrx, no? ati isn't complete or something?
[04:17] <blanky> nickv111: but yes fglrx
[04:17] <NoStop> varsendaggr: you won't see it unless you have more than one window manager installed
[04:17] <blanky> nickv111: here's my log
[04:17] <nickv111> blanky: I did.
[04:17] <mga_mark> Ok, I'll go now. Let you know if I find it. Thanks so much.
[04:17] <linux_kid> mga_mark: and yes and no, this is somewhat of a usual problem although i have never heard of black lines...
[04:17] <blanky> nickv111: you did what?
[04:17] <varsendaggr> NoStop:  what does that mean?
[04:17] <bobbie__4> chmod +777
[04:17] <ChimeraHitman> Can anyone hear me?
[04:17] <nickv111> blanky: I got fglrx work
[04:17] <nickv111> ChimeraHitman: No.
[04:17] <Teratogen`> hi
[04:18] <blanky> nickv111: oh, what tutorial/wiki did you follow plase?
[04:18] <ChimeraHitman> Hi
[04:18] <NoStop> varsendaggr: http://xwinman.org/
[04:18] <blanky> *please, and what card do you have, I have an ati 9800 pro
[04:18] <Kevin`> varsendaggr you won't see it unless you have fluxbox installed along with something else, like gnome, otherwise it will start the only one installed
[04:18] <wceoscar> how can i install the GDM themes in ubuntu?
[04:18] <bobbie__4> ChimeraHitman, we can't hear you, speak louder please
[04:18] <Firefishe> Is there a difference between the kde on the kubuntu cd vs the Universe Repository kde?
[04:19] <ChimeraHitman> When i run Beryl it renders my gnome desktop useless. What could i do fix the problem?
[04:19] <Teratogen`> not sure
[04:19] <wceoscar> how can i install the GDM themes in ubuntu?
[04:19] <H3g3m0n> !gdm
[04:19] <varsendaggr> Kevin: but isnt gnome already installed with ubuntu
[04:19] <ubotu> gdm: GNOME Display Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 1686 kB, installed size 12300 kB
[04:19] <nickv111> blanky: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[04:19] <blanky> can anyone help me install ati drivers, please?
[04:19] <nickv111> blanky: I'm helping you.
[04:19] <blanky> nickv111: yeah, I followed that
[04:19] <blanky> lol okay thanks nickv111
[04:19] <lufis> Kind of an off-topic question, but: I have aspired to program since I was a child but I don't know where to begin. What's a good newbie's programming language that can be learned easily?
[04:19] <nickv111> blanky: So, what's the problem?
[04:19] <blanky> nickv111: here's my log http://paste.jorgepena.be/43
[04:20] <blanky> nickv111: well, when I type fglrxinfo, it outputs this
[04:20] <barata> is lsongs in the ubuntu repository?
[04:20] <H3g3m0n> lufis: Python is fairly easy and widly used
[04:20] <bobbie__4> lufis, try either BASIC or LOGO
[04:20] <ChimeraHitman> If i run beryl-manager, it complains about XGL missing and then acknowledges Nvidia is present.
[04:20] <diskus> lufis: python or ruby
[04:20] <blanky> nickv111: here's what it outputs when I type fglrxinfo http://paste.jorgepena.be/44
[04:20] <ChimeraHitman> Then i can't do anything.
[04:20] <lufis> H3g3m0n: Thanks, I was leaning towards Python.
[04:20] <wceoscar> how can i install the GDM themes in ubuntu?
[04:21] <diskus> lufis: but those are scripting languages
[04:21] <VigoFusion> lufis: Go Ruby. easy to learn and very cutting edge
[04:21] <eternale1> in someones opinion... i'm leaving the world of linux desktop to make my linux box just a headless server. would i be better off continuing with ubuntu (using there server edition) or move onto other distro's or possible other flavors.. bsd* etc. or does it really not matter all together?
[04:21] <lufis> VigoFusion: Cool, thank you
[04:21] <blanky> I think anyone who doesn't understand objects and classes the first time should get a taste of ruby
[04:21] <sinco> is there anyway I can have ubuntu 6.10 server install lilo instead of grub by default?
[04:21] <nickv111> blanky: Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[04:21] <blanky> nickv111: sure thing, hold up
[04:21] <Kevin`> eternale1 ubuntu should work, but is designed for desktop use (the non-server one, of course)
[04:22] <blanky> nickv111: http://paste.jorgepena.be/45

[04:22] <Falstius> how can I recover some files I just deleted from an ext3 filesystem?  (it isn't critical, but I'd like to get them back)

[04:23] <H3g3m0n> Falstius: Theres no easy way under ext3

[04:27] <Falstius> H3g3m0n: yeah, I figured as much.  Its not worth that kind of time.  Thanks.
[04:27] <ChimeraHitman> I followed the beryl-project.net tutorial on setting it up. I have done what they mentioned and i still can't get it to work.
[04:28] <zmm> no, celleron 32 bit

[04:29] <Nilisco> Hey, I'm trying to install ubuntu on my pc (amd 3200 64, i386 version) with a x800xl ati video card.  When the installer starts, the colors are all wrong and then the installer freezes when the bar finishes loading, graphical corruption occurs.
[04:29] <noldon> what do i have to kill to get sound in flash movies
[04:29] <nickv111> Hey, all, why is there a limited amount of region sets on a particular DVD drive? It's concerning, because I have to experiment, and I don't want to kill my DVD drive or anything
[04:29] <blanky> noldon: LOL
[04:29] <edgarin> et
[04:29] <H3g3m0n> Nilisco: Tried the safe graphical mode, or specifying the resolution with the f4 key?

[04:30] <blanky> noldon: yeah I know :P
[04:30] <noldon> ok
[04:31] <H3g3m0n> Nilisco: Might be worth trying ctrl+alt+f1 and seeing if it gives you a text console
[04:31] <noldon> wceoscar install? i think its default but u just have to activate it

[04:45] <noldon> wceoscar use the menu system--->administration--->login window
[04:45] <H3g3m0n> BHSPitLappy: /var/cache/apt/archive is where the downloaded debs go, but if there not in the actuall repos you will probally need to install them manually

[04:46] <BHSPitLappy> H3g3m0n: this computer doesn't have internet access at all, that's why I have the folder full of debs.
[04:46] <H3g3m0n> __Gino__: You probably need to mute something in the volume controls
[04:46] <BHSPitLappy> H3g3m0n: I'd like to add them into synaptic as a local repo, rather than double clicking and chasing deps for hours
[04:47] <H3g3m0n> BHSPitLappy: You could try 'dpkg -i *.deb'
[04:47] <sinco> i just installed the base package - how do i get a screen where i am able to select packages avaible to install from the CD?
[04:47] <H3g3m0n> That would install them all
[04:47] <kalikiana> sinco: synaptic
[04:47] <zmm> I started openoffice with sudo this time and it gave different error in a dialogue box which is pasted at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34044/ . The previous error without sudo is pasted at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34039/
[04:48] <kalikiana> sinco: but you need to select the cd as a source
[04:48] <zmm> why openoffice is not working
[04:48] <sinco> can you do that in teh console?
[04:48] <fr500> hello
[04:48] <__Gino__> H3g3m0n, I tried muting everything (separately) but they all muted both sets of speakers...
[04:48] <ivx> hey whenever i try to boot from the smp kernel it says kernel panic:VFS" Unalbe to mount root fs on 00:00. anyone know whats going on
[04:48] <fr500> can anyone give me an stock sources.list?
[04:48] <BHSPitLappy> H3g3m0n: I'll see if it works
[04:48] <kalikiana> sinco: oh, no - try 'aptitude'
[04:48] <sinco> oh ok thanks
[04:48] <noldon> zmm : killall ooffice
[04:48] <CoRnJuLiOx> noldon: did you get my /msgs?
[04:49] <jr> its slow surfing the internet with firefox/ubuntu, if I surf with windows xo its faster, anyone got an idea of why this is?
[04:49] <zmm> noldon: should i run "killall ooffice" in terminal.
[04:49] <Vorbote> fr500, /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list
[04:49] <DanaG> __Gino__: you may need a newer version of ALSA than the repos provide.
[04:49] <tonyyarusso> I need help making a digital voice recorder work with Ubuntu (Olympus VN-3100PC).  It registers in /var/log/syslog and 'lsusb', but doesn't seem to create a /dev/sd* or mount itself.
[04:50] <H3g3m0n> jr: Try disabling ipv6 in about:config
[04:50] <fr500> thanks Vorbote
[04:50] <DanaG> However, I don't know how to manually install the newer version (without also doing a new kernel)
[04:50] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx did u get mine?
[04:50] <noldon> zmm yes were else?
[04:50] <H3g3m0n> !ipv6
[04:50] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[04:50] <__Gino__> Well... the thing is, I've been using Ubuntu for months and never had this problem (on the same laptop) but I reinstalled Edgy and am having the problem now... I never installed a new version of Alsa.
[04:51] <H3g3m0n> __Gino__: Might be worth making sure the plug is all the way in sometimes they can get stuck partway :)
[04:51] <zmm> noldon: it said "ooffice: no process killed"
[04:51] <CoRnJuLiOx> noldon: just the one asking me what the issue is
[04:51] <noldon> zmm then i dont know
[04:51] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx strange
[04:51] <ali_> How do I get the edgy 6.10 download to install?
[04:52] <__Gino__> H3g3m0n, haha, yeah, I have tried that. Still doesn't work though... :)
[04:52] <CoRnJuLiOx> i got that message, though
[04:52] <DanaG> __Gino__: is it snd-hda-intel?  That module seems to give me all sorts of problems.
[04:52] <CoRnJuLiOx> anyways, its not playing the sound in the .rmvb files, and i know they have sound because it worked just last night
[04:53] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx it seems like the people i message private here dont recive my message
[04:53] <CoRnJuLiOx> nothings muted, and xmms even plays mp3 files with full sound
[04:53] <Nilisco> H3g3m0n, no luck messing with the values, I appreciate the help though!
[04:53] <__Gino__> DanaG, I don't think so... nothing about intel when I do lspci command...
[04:53] <DanaG> do lsmod | grep snd
[04:54] <ali_> ---------------How do I get the Edgy 6.10 iso download to install-----------
[04:54] <H3g3m0n> Nilisco: You could try using the official binary drivers for your card, should be possible to install them on the livecd
[04:54] <__Gino__> Yup... It says snd_hda_intel
[04:54] <H3g3m0n> !isos
[04:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about isos - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:54] <H3g3m0n> !iso
[04:54] <DanaG> aah.
[04:54] <ubotu> To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[04:55] <H3g3m0n> ali_: Just goto ubuntu.com and then download
[04:55] <DanaG> I remember there were some fixes in newer ALSA versions to manually mute speakers when an external jack was used.
[04:55] <CoRnJuLiOx> noldon: can you even see my msgs? i can see yours.
[04:56] <__Gino__> I'll try installing a new ALSA version. Thanks!
[04:56] <ali_> I went to the Ubuntu site and downloaded Edgy 6.10. I downloaded it and nothing
[04:56] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx yes i see them but u dont seems to see mine
[04:56] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx i sended u alot of message they seems to get lost
[04:56] <DanaG> Look at the changelogs
[04:56] <DanaG> for 1.0.12 and 1.0.13
[04:56] <noldon> CoRnJuLiOx my internet connection is bad
[04:58] <noldon> wceoscar have u manage to install them?
[04:59] <whta> hello again
[04:59] <whta> is there any sort of fix for this little issue of flash videos coming horribly out of sync with their sound?
[05:00] <NeXCiS> It could be the video itself
[05:00] <whta> nope, it's EVERY VIDEO
[05:01] <whta> and i've had this problem before and after a reformat and on different hardware
[05:01] <guest_> I'm using putty and I'd like make it o that I can I can assign the 'up' arrow key to Alt+y or something
[05:01] <guest_> like that
[05:01] <guest_> Is this possible?
[05:01] <guest_> I guess this is not the right channel to ask, I need to find a putty channel
[05:01] <jr> whoever helped me with the slow internet issue thanks alot, I got it straight
[05:01] <harry> how do i mount /dev/hdc3 to media?
[05:02] <LadyNikon> heh
[05:02] <jr> who wants to help with a screwed up wireless connection?
[05:02] <kalikiana> harry: look at fstab, learn and add your own ;)
[05:02] <noldon> harry mount /dev/hdc3 /media/(foldername)
[05:02] <guest_> You can edit the fstab file with vi
[05:02] <guest_> it's pretty easy
[05:02] <guest_> Just don't screw up :-D
[05:02] <kalikiana> or with any text editor in fact
[05:03] <noldon> yes remove all in fstab and put in new
[05:03] <noldon> just kidding
[05:03] <guest_> when I first found out you can edit the fstab file I was ecstatic
[05:03] <kalikiana> you can test anything with 'mount -a' :)
[05:03] <guest_> I thought it was just for viewing  <-- shmuck
[05:03] <wceoscar> noldon, Of course... i installed them succesfully
[05:03] <wceoscar> thanks
[05:03] <noldon> wceoscar np
[05:04] <kalikiana> guest_: fstab is for all fixed mounts
[05:04] <guest_> wceoscar did you get your torrent client up and running
[05:04] <noldon> wceoscar were did u found them?
[05:04] <wceoscar> is there a site thats thedicated to ubuntu torrents??
[05:04] <vader> quick question, where would I find a link for upgrading a pc from 6.06 to 6.10 that has the Nvidia video?
[05:04] <guest_> what do you mean kalikiania?
[05:05] <jr> I can set the wlan0 up with the correct essid and 64 bit hex key but it still says no signal
[05:05] <sohmc> how do I get x to display a widescreen resolution?  I'm running xfce as my wm
[05:05] <DanaG> argh, simple-backup is being stupid
[05:05] <DanaG> It won't let me select all.
[05:06] <noldon> wceoscar http://www.linuxtracker.org/ there u have a torrent tracker for linux
[05:06] <guest_> kalikiana: Say I need to add a secondary SATA drive on my computer...I will need to edit the fstab and place it there after or before running cfdisk on the drive?
[05:06] <omeganine> sohmc: Do you have your display drivers installed?
[05:06] <rc-1> how do i set my resolution to 1650x1080 at 60hzi?
[05:06] <sohmc> omeganine, yes
[05:06] <guest_> I also need to format it as ext3 as well, is that done via cfdisk?
[05:07] <litropy> guys
[05:07] <omeganine> sohmc: You need to setup your monitor...GIve me a sec, forgot the command in ubuntu
[05:07] <guest_> rc, you can change that in a conf file
[05:07] <guest_> I think it's Xorg.conf
[05:07] <nickv111> I have an MPEG 2 file. How do I convert this to a .ogm?
[05:07] <guest_> do a locate xorg.conf
[05:07] <rc-1> im using beryl does that make a difference?
[05:08] <guest_> Then you can vi into that file and change the resolution manuall I believe
[05:08] <guest_> I don't know what beryl is
[05:08] <varsendaggr> Hello, i am having a problem with fluxbox... im a noob and the menu is not showing up in fluxbox when i first right click

[05:08] <manmadha> can any one help me/
[05:08] <litropy> I have a guy whose usb keyboard interfeace is screwed, but he can still use his mouse. It IS the keyboard interface and not his keyboard. Is there a way to set an ubuntu livecd to boot automatically, without keystrokes, and without setting anything in the os on the hard drive?
[05:08] <wceoscar> i have azureus
[05:08] <wceoscar> as my client
[05:08] <sohmc> omeganine, I tried running that and it crasshes
[05:09] <omeganine> sohmc: What display drivers are you using?
[05:09] <kalikiana> guest_: use gparted for formatting
[05:09] <manmadha> any body there?
[05:09] <bobbie__4> Does George Bush use Linux?
[05:09] <harry> noldon. how do i specify the filetype. what kind of command
[05:09] <sohmc> intel
[05:09] <sohmc> brb
[05:09] <guest_> I remember using a command line interface utility to format, but I guess I can use gparted
[05:10] <guest_> it would be nice to know how to format through the CLI
[05:10] <haxality> hey, I want to run a program at bootup. how do I do this? will putting the command in a text file and playing it in /etc/init.d/ be enough?
[05:10] <haxality> playing = placing
[05:10] <kalikiana> guest_: sry, don't have it in mind right now
[05:10] <guest_> Oh, if anyoe wants to read a great 80 page essay on the command line interface, I found a Neal Stephenson essay on it. check it out
[05:10] <noldon> guest_ u using mkfs.ext3 to format a hdd
[05:10] <noldon> harry i dont remember youre issue
[05:10] <dibblego> haxality, man update-rc
[05:10] <haxality> thanks a ton dibblego
[05:10] <guest_> noldon, that was the one
[05:10] <guest_> mkfs is the one
[05:11] <guest_> noldon: before you mount the drive, you will need to format it by mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb correct?
[05:11] <dibblego> haxality, sorry, update-rc.d
[05:12] <noldon> wasnt it /dev/hdc3?
[05:12] <varsendaggr> Hello does anyone have any idea why my menu is not showing up when i right click in fluxbox
[05:12] <guest_> You might have to recreate your fluxbox profile varsen
[05:12] <guest_> That happened to me on GNOME
[05:12] <guest_> I could not see my bar on the top
[05:12] <guest_> so I just recreated my gnome profile
[05:13] <litropy> alright... one more time - sorry for flooding - this guy really needs to get to his computer....
[05:13] <litropy> I have a guy whose usb keyboard interfeace is screwed, but he can still use his mouse. It IS the keyboard interface and not his keyboard. Is there a way to set an ubuntu livecd to boot automatically, without keystrokes, and without setting anything in the os on the hard drive?
[05:13] <noldon> guest_ yes before u mount it i think dont remember
[05:13] <wceoscar> How Can i install Spash Screns?? i downloaded a dfew and what to enable them as i did with the start screen
[05:13] <noldon> spash?
[05:14] <Blacken> O-kay, so can anyone tell me why just about every major process--Xorg, gaim, Ktorrent, etc.--on my machine would suddenly start SCREAMING for resources? I just had to actually reboot my box because four processes were demanding 100%+ cpu time.
[05:14] <haxality> ok, let's hope this works.
[05:14] <varsendaggr> guest_: how do i do that?
[05:14] <rc-1> hmmm enabled them in xorg.conf but still dont show up in set resolution
[05:14] <rc-1> do i have to reboot?
[05:14] <guest_> When you mount you have to specify which filesystem the drive is, so it makes perfect sense to format the secondar drive by mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb
[05:15] <guest_> Then again how would you know that the drive you connected is sdb?
[05:15] <guest_> I guess you have to just know
[05:15] <wceoscar> How Can i install Spash Screns?? i downloaded a dfew and what to enable them as i did with the start screen
[05:15] <varsendaggr> guest_: i am having the same problem with gnome
[05:15] <varsendaggr> guest_: as well as fluxbox
[05:16] <noldon> is anyone seeing my msg
[05:16] <fr500> noldon: yah
[05:16] <varsendaggr> guest_: will recreating the profiles fix both those things?
[05:16] <haxality> ok..
[05:16] <noldon> fr500 dosnt seems like it
[05:17] <guest_> I'm not sure but it sure won't hurt to try
[05:17] <guest_> when you find the filename
[05:17] <guest_> just do a mv filename filename.old
[05:17] <varsendaggr> guest_: how do i do it?
[05:17] <haxality> the script I placed in /etc/init.d/ didn't work
[05:17] <guest_> let me find out what file it is
[05:17] <guest_> the gnome profile is in your home folder somewhere let me hunt for it
[05:18] <varsendaggr> guest_: ok
[05:18] <guest_> it's one of those crazy hiden files
[05:18] <guest_> it starts wit ha dot
[05:18] <DanaG> well, that's just great: sbackup's restore tool DOESN'T WORK!
[05:18] <varsendaggr> guest: :D
[05:18] <noldon> wceoscar no idea
[05:18] <guest_> ok, varsendagger
[05:18] <varsendaggr> guest_: yes?
[05:18] <noldon> didnt knew that ubuntu had a splash screen
[05:19] <noldon> i guess i missed that
[05:19] <guest_> try mv .gnome .gnome.old to recreate your gnome profile, but don't take my word for it, i'm not to osure
[05:19] <wceoscar> spash screens?? hot to apply them?
[05:19] <guest_> That will rename your .gnome file to .gnome.old
[05:19] <guest_> Which will force gnome to create another brand new profile
[05:19] <guest_> sort of like your firefox profile when it gets corrupted, you can do the same thing
[05:20] <varsendaggr> guest_: ok so let me see if i understand... this will delete my 2 profiles i have in ubuntu and then i will replace them with one new one and everything should work?
[05:20] <guest_> it won't delete them
[05:20] <guest_> it will rename the file to .old
[05:20] <DanaG> OSError: [Errno 2]  No such file or directory: '/sbin/tmpp_UZEN/sbin/swapoff'
[05:20] <DanaG> OSError: [Errno 2]  No such file or directory: '/bin/tmpWv32dQ/bin/pidof'
[05:20] <varsendaggr> guest_: ok
[05:20] <DanaG> wtf?
[05:20] <guest_> mv .fluxbox .fluxbox.old
[05:21] <guest_> you'll have to bounce the xserverr by ctrl alt del ling
[05:21] <guest_> Try that and let me know if it work
[05:21] <guest_> works
[05:21] <varsendaggr> guest_: o i see then would i delete a profile i dont want in ubuntu the same way?
[05:21] <noldon> wceoscar an u read me?
[05:21] <noldon> can
[05:21] <noldon> damn
[05:21] <guest_> No reason to delete your profile, just rename it so you have it just in case shite hits the fan
[05:21] <noldon> can*
[05:22] <varsendaggr> guest_: ok ty very much
[05:22] <guest_> I haven't tried this, I heard it works fine, but get back to me on that ok
[05:22] <guest_> does anyone know if I can run vmware for free and try ubuntu on my pc
[05:23] <guest_> I know vmplayer is free, but the ubuntu image, how does that work
[05:23] <codo> hello all

[05:29] <Nilisco> H3g3m0n, finally got it working, it apparently is a pretty big bug that is unresolved.  I had to remove gli and dri from xorg.conf, and the live cd is now booting in some sort of vesa mode and installing.  Apparently fglrx would have fixed it as you suggested.  Thanks!

[05:31] <foo> I set up nvidia hardware raid (mirroring) .. with 2 identical sata drives. Under ubuntu, this should look like /dev/sda, and /dev/sdb should not exist? Right? If it does, then linux doesn't have the drivers for the hardware raid?
[05:32] <harry> noldon: i just entered the user of this computer
[05:32] <CoRnJuLiOx> does anything else out there play .rmvbs aside from realplayer?

[05:45] <harry> noldon: no nothing just happened.
[05:45] <poningru> skyfaller-linux: guess the devs just didnt want to include it by default
[05:45] <sizzam> skyfaller-linux: what applet are you looking for?
[05:45] <poningru> did it work though?
[05:45] <skyfaller-linux> sizzam: the fast-user-switching applet

[05:57] <harry> noldon: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34054/
[05:57] <poningru> skyfaller-linux: thats weird...
[05:57] <poningru> the weather thing didnt work?
[05:58] <skyfaller-linux> poningru: I mean, I have one in my menubar through "add to panel"... but I wanted one on my desktop
[05:58] <globe> Is there some setting I have to do to get xarchiver to use unrar or unrar-free? .... they are installed but it still tells me that I do not have the proper archiver.
[05:59] <poningru> on your desktop?
[05:59] <skyfaller-linux> poningru: there are 4 different weather widgets that you can get through gdesklets, and none of them work for me, they seem to have trouble connecting
[05:59] <poningru> weird
[05:59] <poningru> oh gdesklet... yeah never experimented with that
[05:59] <skyfaller-linux> poningru: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDesklets

[06:06] <Kevin`> Jager- sure anything like that

[06:08] <Music_Shuffle> I do, when I use Gnome. ;P
[06:08] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: so what do you recommend?

[06:13] <guest_> How do I install the linux header packages?
[06:13] <Kevin`> kelly_ some advice: just ask for what you want, don't ask about asking

[06:13] <kelly_> what is the best antivirus programme for ubuntu??
[06:14] <Jager-> Kevin` Okay Ill go try that, brb
[06:14] <Jager-> Kevin` .. what will this do?
[06:14] <guest_> Kelly I wouldn't install an antivirus program
[06:14] <kitche> kelly_: well there really isn't one for linux most of the antivirus programs only scan windows viruses
[06:14] <guest_> It's a low level filesystem filter, it's just going to slow things down
[06:14] <kelly_> why is that??
[06:14] <Kevin`> kelly_ unless you plan to use it as a fileserver for windows machines antivirus isn't really needed
[06:14] <Dheeraj_k> why some 1 need antivirus in linux?
[06:14] <Kevin`> Jager- load windows, hopefully
[06:14] <kitche> Dheeraj_k: for a mail server or fileserver :)
[06:14] <kelly_> isanti virus needed when you use p2p programmes?
[06:14] <Jager-> Kevin` Will I need to do this every time I want to boot into windows?
[06:15] <kitche> kelly_: on windows yes on linux not really
[06:15] <matjan> hi, i have a big problem playing dvd's... i have installed all libraries, codecs and what not for it but still have trouble... for this particular cd, it plays for 20 minutes and then just quits... what could be the problem?

[06:15] <matjan> for another (commercial) dvd, the menus make xine, vlc or totem frak out, i.e. they crash...
[06:15] <Kevin`> kelly_ if you are downloading linux warez, I suppose, but why would you do something so stupid
[06:15] <Kevin`> Jager- you can add it to the menu if it works
[06:15] <Jager-> K, Im gonna go try... wish me luck :o
[06:15] <guest_> Kelly a filter is going to slow down your disk I/O, just be the educated user you probably are and don't run any strange binaries...in fact your chances of getting infected are close to zero
[06:15] <guest_> You don't even need to be an educated user
[06:16] <Dheeraj_k> i don't think virus will harm in linux until user login as root
[06:16] <kelly_> I wanted to use limewire for music sharing ect have had countless problems with viruses on it with windows that is why i ask
[06:16] <Kevin`> Dheeraj_k it can erase user data, but viruses don't commonly infect linux anyway, due mostly to the diversity of programs used
[06:16] <floating> Can someone help me installing kanjipad, this: http://www.gtk.org/~otaylor/kanjipad/
[06:17] <Kevin`> the windows viruses you get on limewire just plain won't work in linux
[06:17] <sizzam> floating: its in the repos
[06:17] <sizzam> floating: sudo aptitude install kanjipad
[06:17] <Kevin`> it's not that hard to avoid getting them in the first place, if your smart, even when using windows...
[06:17] <kelly_> that is loads better than windows then glad i changed now
[06:17] <kaiki> Kevin: Should Rootkits be watched out for though still?
[06:17] <Dheeraj_k> yeah i know thats why i am using ubuntu :)
[06:17] <floating> ohhh, sizzam, thanks. I searched it from the add/remove but there it wasnt
[06:18] <Kevin`> kaiki on limewire? lol
[06:18] <Kevin`> rootkits are installed by people often, not automatically like a virus
[06:18] <Kevin`> sure, look out for them.
[06:18] <kelly_> can i get a more up to date web browser for ubuntu other than firefox?
[06:18] <Kevin`> more importantly, don't run network services if you aren't using them
[06:18] <guest_> I dont understand why people are not using torrent clients and are still using things like limewire, bearshare, etc..
[06:19] <Dheeraj_k> actually i h8 antivirus thats why i never installed it on windows too. but never faced the problem of virus infection in windows
[06:19] <Kevin`> guest_ larger base of files still
[06:19] <guest_> Kelly, use firefox2
[06:19] <kelly_> can i get a more up to date web browser for ubuntu other than firefox??
[06:19] <guest_> Or opera, there is no bettter browser out there IMO
[06:19] <kelly_> and what is a torrent share?
[06:19] <Dheeraj_k> antivirus like norton is it self a big virus
[06:19] <Dheeraj_k> swiftfox
[06:19] <guest_> Kelly, go to utorrent.com and do some reading
[06:20] <Kevin`> bittorent is a protocol used for downloading files, that's all
[06:20] <ixian_> kelly_, you don't get much more 'up to date' than firefox
[06:20] <guest_> It's much beter than limewire
[06:20] <guest_> limewire, napster, bearshare, all old school
[06:20] <Kevin`> and usenet is much better then both of them =p
[06:20] <kelly_> i have heard about opera web browser is that any better?
[06:20] <Jager-> Kevin`, no luck there :/
[06:20] <Kevin`> Jager- what did it do.
[06:21] <ixian_> kelly_, depends on who you ask. most people prefer firefox over opera
[06:21] <Jager-> Kevin` when I typed chainloader +1 it said "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist"
[06:21] <guest_> Kelly, Firefox should do it for you, I feel you're a bit shy of using firefox
[06:21] <Music_Shuffle> skyfaller, you still here?
[06:21] <Kevin`> Jager- that's interesting
[06:21] <guest_> It's one of the best if not the best browser out there
[06:21] <skyfaller> Music_Shuffle: yup
[06:21] <Music_Shuffle> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=215769
[06:21] <Music_Shuffle> Should be your guide to success. ;)
[06:21] <Kevin`> try root (hd then press tab, to get a list of disks
[06:21] <Kevin`> and try partition 0 on any listed
[06:21] <kelly_> firefox is ok only it doesn't display things the same on things like ebay ect
[06:21] <guest_> kelly: just run sudo apt-get install firefox and that'll get you the latest version
[06:22] <bill57785> hey, can anyone help? I am trying to play music from a partition that was/is used by windows (I have linux installed with it). I can't play any music on that partition......when it goes to play each song, it just skips to the next (which in turn skips through them all). I've tried it with three different media players.
[06:22] <Kevin`> the same as what, kelly_
[06:22] <Jager-> in grub?
[06:22] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: Oh, these are screenscrapers?  that's really ugly
[06:22] <Kevin`> Jager- yes, in grub
[06:22] <Jager-> k
[06:22] <kelly_> the same as internet explorer 7 on xp
[06:22] <guest_> Kelly, what do you mean can you be more specific
[06:23] <Jager-> root gives me an error
[06:23] <guest_> i've always wondered why does everyone have an underscore by their username
[06:23] <Kevin`> kelly_ get over it, firefox works on many more platforms then xp (or complain to ebay that their site isn't working properly)
[06:23] <Dheeraj_k> which media player u r using?
[06:23] <malt> is it hard to install cpanel on ubuntu?
[06:23] <Dheeraj_k> @bill57785:
[06:23] <guest_> Kevin, Kelly makes a very good point though, she's probably trying to switch to linux and needs some help, be kinder please
[06:24] <Kevin`> never tried, cpanel is too expensive to install unless some client who's dependent on it pays for me to install it :)
[06:24] <ixian_> kelly_ could be a guy you know
[06:24] <ahab> you are right kelly, each browser decodes, and therefore in some ways displays wed pages differently
[06:24] <ahab> they are working on unifying web code, but for now, we bow to no man
[06:24] <ixian_> :P
[06:24] <guest_> She's probably trying to view flash or shockwave or other proprietary stuff
[06:24] <guest_> haha ixian, whatever
[06:24] <Kevin`> guest_ there's not much else to say, it's going to look slightly different, and you can't always change it
[06:24] <kaiki> Kelly: you could always run IE in a emulator
[06:24] <thrillin`> i need some mac help here please...again :(
[06:24] <Jager-> Er Kevin`, what do i type in grub?
[06:25] <Kevin`> guest_ flash works fine in firefox..
[06:25] <Kevin`> root (hd then press tab
[06:25] <Jager-> k
[06:25] <Kevin`> it will give a list of hard drives
[06:25] <Dheeraj_k> use the swiftfoz @kelly
[06:25] <Dheeraj_k> it is the optimized version of firefox
[06:25] <Dheeraj_k> swiftfox
[06:25] <guest_> Kevin I know what you mean, I just don't want people to get turned off when they're switching that's all. I think this channel is an awesome place to get help though, so props to everyone
[06:25] <bill57785> Dheeraj_k: I tried Kaffeine Player, amaroK, and Rhythmbox
[06:25] <Jager-> Kevin` Error 21: Selected disk does not exist
[06:25] <cherubiel> kelly_: get ies4linux
[06:25] <Jager-> O_o
[06:26] <ahab> kelly could install flash for mozilla in ubuntu
[06:26] <ahab> it works fine for me even with ebay
[06:26] <guest_> Kelly: if firefox isn't showing things you way you see them in IE7, you can run it off Wine, which is an emulator, and it will allow you to run windows applications
[06:26] <guest_> cherubiel what is ies4linux
[06:26] <Kevin`> it's better to get used to the small differences then try to run some windows application in linux to have it look the same
[06:27] <cherubiel> guest_: www.tatanka.com.br
[06:27] <guest_>  before you install a package from apt-get, can you have it tell you some info about the package off the command line
[06:27] <ahab> can anyone see my text?
[06:27] <Jager-> yes
[06:27] <DARKGuy> I can
[06:27] <Kevin`> no ahab
[06:27] <Jager-> lol Kevin`
[06:27] <DARKGuy> oO lol
[06:27] <ahab> just checking to make sure i was logged in and all
[06:27] <guest_> that's true kevi
[06:27] <Jager-> Kevin' root (hd says the selected disk does not exist! -_-
[06:28] <Kevin`> Jager- you pressed tab right, not enter
[06:28] <Dheeraj_k> bill57785: enter this in terminal sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl gstreamer0.10-plugins-base \ gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse \ gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse w32codecs
[06:28] <Jager-> Im stupid
[06:28] <guest_> ies4linux looks awesome
[06:28] <Jager-> Kevin` when I hit tab, it just goes down and says the same thing?
[06:29] <Kevin`> the only reason to use IE in linux is if your a web developer and care about IE users :/
[06:29] <Kevin`> Jager- it doesn't list anything?
[06:29] <fildo> !mysqld
[06:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mysqld - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[06:30] <poningru> sysrage: you have to add multiverse/universe repos
[06:30] <Music_Shuffle> sysrage, KDE or Gnome?
[06:30] <Kevin`> Jager- that's very odd, how is grub booting linux then
[06:30] <Dheeraj_k> sudo apt-get install xchat
[06:30] <poningru> sysrage: its xchat2 btw
[06:30] <cherubiel> !info xchat
[06:30] <sysrage_> and why the heck do i have to type  twice before it shows up in knosole?
[06:30] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.6-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 275 kB, installed size 760 kB

[06:31] <poningru> yeah it is xchat

[06:31] <thrillin`> anyone know where i could garab a cheap laptop
[06:31] <sysrage_> if i in kde do i do xchat-kde?
[06:31] <thrillin`> *grab
[06:31] <thrillin`> to put ubuntu on
[06:32] <Kevin`> thrillin` ebay, as always :)
[06:32] <suricate> sysrage_: no :P
[06:32] <Kevin`> or go to a store and browse laptops
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle> No no, not xchat-kde.
[06:32] <thrillin`> true
[06:32] <sizzam> thrillin`: maybe craigslist.com
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle> skyfaller, I don't think so. =/
[06:32] <Frem> you'd use kopete if you were using kde, not xchat.
[06:32] <Jager-> Kevin` http://pastebin.ca/258158
[06:32] <sizzam> thrillin`: oops, craigslist.org
[06:32] <thrillin`> i just not confident enough to do it on mac
[06:32] <sysrage_> kinda stupid package name if there isnt one for both..
[06:32] <Kevin`> thrillin` the only thing you need to be aware of is to check the hardware on that laptop model before buying
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle> Its not Kopete, its Konversation, isn't it?
[06:32] <sysrage_> omg this double  is pissing me off. what causes that?
[06:32] <Firefishe> Has anyone here using a 1ghz g4 aluminum powerbook been able to enable right-clicking via a ctrl/alt/apple key + left click sequence?
[06:32] <thrillin`> need to learn more about mac first
[06:32] <noldon_> kopete?
[06:32] <Kevin`> thrillin` linux works great on the macbook I have here
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle> Kopete's just for messenger.
[06:32] <Kevin`> macbooks are hardly cheap though
[06:32] <Music_Shuffle> Konversation is the IRC client.
[06:33] <Firefishe> that's one or the other key + left click
[06:33] <thrillin`> [00:36]  <Kevin`> thrillin` linux works great on the macbook I have here <-- i have a powerbook and a desktop pc
[06:33] <noldon_> just use xchat
[06:33] <Frem> Music_Shuffle, I'm an XFCE fan, so I'm a bit fuzzy about KDE to start with. ;-)
[06:33] <Jager-> xchat is very good
[06:33] <thrillin`> kevin: how did you get it to work on yours...install process etc?
[06:33] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: GDesklets is in really sad shape... someone needs to take over the project and give it an overhaul
[06:33] <DARKGuy> I agree
[06:33] <Jager-> But mIRC is my fav.. and I wish it was for linux
[06:33] <DARKGuy> or irssi for terminal-based chat
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle> skyfaller, go for it? ;)
[06:33] <Music_Shuffle> Frem, heh.  Got it yet? :)
[06:33] <sysrage_> installing xchat-gnome (even though im in kde *sigh*.. but why on earth is my konsole making me hit  twice before it shows up?
[06:33] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: Is KDE better?  Should I switch to Kubuntu?  How are the widgets there? ;-)
[06:34] <cherubiel> Jager-: the comment says it was autodetected on hdb
[06:34] <cherubiel> try root (hd1, 0)
[06:34] <Kevin`> thrillin` actually it was deceptively easy, pressed option on boot and selected the cd (debian etch at the time)
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle> Umm, Kubuntu hates me, so I hate it too. </3.
[06:34] <Dheeraj_k> i am using gaim to access irc :)
[06:34] <Firefishe> Jager-, wine usually runs mirc with no trouble, but logging doesn't usually work across the partitions.
[06:34] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: alas :(
[06:34] <Jager-> cherubiel alright
[06:34] <suricate> sysrage_: konversation is better for kde IMO
[06:34] <Music_Shuffle> I use KDE under Ubuntu, and have KDE, Gnome, Flux, and IceWM installed. Oh, and Enlightenment. Much shiny.
[06:34] <noldon_> sysrage what u mean xchat-gnome?
[06:34] <Kevin`> thrillin` this is an x86 macintosh, there are distros for ppc macintosh, but as I don't have one i've never used them
[06:35] <Kevin`> does ubuntu have a ppc version? (to channel(
[06:35] <Reality-X> sup folks, I just installed Mepis(Ubuntu Derived) and am looking to set it up as a Firewall/GW machine to provide net access to my network. Iptables is installed and built into the kernel. I was wondering if there happens to be any nice GUI for it out there, or am i going to have to write script files?
[06:35] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah, you can run IRC through Gaim, Konversation, XChat, BitchX...there's a lot of clients.
[06:35] <skyfaller-linux> Kevin`: yes
[06:35] <Jager-> Error 21: Selected disk does not exist
[06:35] <Jager-> wtf
[06:35] <Firefishe> Kevin`:  Yes, and I'm on it ;)
[06:35] <guest_> cherubiel, what does !info xchat do
[06:35] <Kevin`> great :)
[06:35] <thrillin`> well
[06:35] <suricate> Reality-X: google for Quicktables
[06:35] <thrillin`> help please
[06:35] <suricate> or something
[06:35] <Jager-> cherubiel "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist"
[06:35] <thrillin`> i wanna do it on my maac too
[06:35] <Kevin`> Jager- root (hd0,0)
[06:35] <thrillin`> share d wealth ppl
[06:35] <Kevin`> chainloader +1
[06:35] <Kevin`> boot
[06:35] <Reality-X> suricate, thanks
[06:36] <Jager-> cherubiel "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist"
[06:36] <skyfaller-linux> Music_Shuffle: so you would recommend running KDE?  I was, um, concerned that running both KDE and GNOME at the same time would slow down my machine
[06:36] <bill57785> Dheeraj_k: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34061/
[06:36] <skyfaller-linux> otherwise I suppose I could try the KDE widget engine
[06:36] <Frem> javac is complaining that it can't find package hsa, and i can't find this package in the repos.
[06:36] <Firefishe> skyfaller-linux:  at the same time? how's that possible?  two x servers?
[06:36] <Music_Shuffle> I have both up right now, runs just fine, and my machine's nothing special I assure you.  It was average 4 years ago. ;P
[06:36] <thrillin`> Firefishe: you running OSX still as well?
[06:36] <sysrage_> what the hell is this crap?
[06:36] <Kevin`> skyfaller-linux it very likely could slow down your machine, but how would you run both at once? having both installed wouldn't be running both
[06:36] <Jager-> Kevin` "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist"
[06:36] <Dheeraj_k> i am running both kde and gnome but kde is way better
[06:37] <Music_Shuffle> Actually, I have Ice up too. Odd.
[06:37] <skyfaller-linux> Firefishe: erm, I meant using KDE and GNOME programs at the same time
[06:37] <Kevin`> Jager- try just root(hd0,1)
[06:37] <sysrage_> xchat-gnome is far from the xchat i want
[06:37] <cherubiel> Jager-: wait, what are you trying to do btw?
[06:37] <Music_Shuffle> Kevin`, you can run both at the same time.
[06:37] <Music_Shuffle> Or three, or howmanyever really.
[06:37] <lmosher> How do I set the volume label of a device (/dev/sda2 for example)? I have a USB disk that I formatted FAT32. I then labeled it in windows as 'DATA', which also applied in Linux. I re-sized the partition in linux and now the label is "</body></ht". In Windows it still reads as "data".
[06:37] <ahab> skyfaller- you can boot each session seperately so that they dont run at the same time
[06:37] <Jager-> Kevin` "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist"
[06:37] <Kevin`> skyfaller-linux in my experience, any slowdown from that isn't significant
[06:37] <thrillin`> Firefishe: you running OSX still as well?
[06:37] <Jager-> cherubiel I cant boot into windows...
[06:37] <Firefishe> thrillin`:  yes, as I have quite an investment in Tiger.  But I'm also working to get KDE up and running, but my home directory's file permissions won't let the x server or kde's apps write their system files to the DOT files.
[06:38] <skyfaller-linux> sorry folks, I'm like a Linux noob again... I haven't run Linux in 3 years, I got a Mac when I realized there wasn't any good video-editing software for Linux
[06:38] <sysrage_> can somebody please tell me how to install xchat like the xchat that comes with every other damn distro?
[06:38] <Kevin`> thrillin` I am running both os x and linux on that laptop
[06:38] <suricate> Jager-: is it at another HD?
[06:38] <cherubiel> Jager-: and do you see the right part in fdisk -l /dev/hdx ?
[06:38] <Kevin`> hmm I forgot a step actually
[06:38] <Kevin`> resize the mac partition
[06:38] <sysrage_> not this xchat-gnome crap that doesn work for crap
[06:38] <cherubiel> Jager-: x with a,b,c,d ?
[06:38] <thrillin`> so help me please if u guys not busy
[06:38] <Kevin`> (from within os x, easy to do)
[06:38] <noldon_> i just tried xchat-gnome but i think i stick with the usuall xchat
[06:38] <Music_Shuffle> sysrage, package manager, search, select, install?
[06:38] <skyfaller-linux> Kevin`: thanks, glad to know it's not too much slower
[06:38] <cherubiel> nothing to beat bitchx guys, imho
[06:38] <Keyseir> What are the terminal commands for changing volume?
[06:38] <sysrage_> bitchx is crap. irssi owns bitchx.. but i want a gui
[06:39] <Firefishe> Kevin`:  Did you say you were using an x86 mac?
[06:39] <Jager-> cherubiel where do i do that?
[06:39] <ahab> sysrage enter "sudo synaptic" in a command line
[06:39] <noldon_> damn i have to sleep shes 6:40 am here
[06:39] <Kevin`> Firefishe ya
[06:39] <cherubiel> Jager-: fire up a terminal, type fdisk -l /dev/hda
[06:39] <cherubiel> output the contents in the pastebin
[06:39] <lmosher> How do you define a volume label for a fat32 partition?
[06:39] <suricate> sysrage_: have you tried konversation?
[06:39] <Firefishe> Kevin`: how do you like it?  laptop or desktop?
[06:39] <guest_> I got irssi running, irc client for cmmand line, no BS , it's great
[06:39] <Kevin`> laptop, works great
[06:39] <noldon_> lmosher vfat
[06:39] <Jager-> cherubiel It does nothing
[06:39] <Kevin`> nice piece of hardware
[06:40] <cherubiel> Jager-: what did you do?
[06:40] <Firefishe> Kevin`:  Mac Book Pro?
[06:40] <lmosher> noldon_, Does that change the answer?
[06:40] <Kevin`> macbook
[06:40] <Kevin`> notpro
[06:40] <sysrage_> suricate: i glad you like it, but i not interested in changing my irc client. ive used xchat for years and i happy with it
[06:40] <Jager-> cherubiel I opend terminal and typed  fdisk -l /dev/hda
[06:40] <DARKGuy> It is, though it takes some time to get used to /window :P - personally, GAIM is the best one for IRC if you don't like X-Chat :P
[06:40] <Music_Shuffle> Kevin`, how much was that?
[06:40] <noldon_> lmosher ?
[06:40] <Kevin`> around 1000, ebay
[06:40] <cherubiel> Jager-: and no output?
[06:40] <Dheeraj_k> @bill57785 : type this command in  terminal sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:40] <Jager-> cherubiel no out put
[06:40] <Music_Shuffle> Nice. ^_^
[06:40] <lmosher> noldon_, calling it vfat vs fat32, does that change the answer to the question?
[06:40] <cherubiel> Jager-: wierd, tat explains why root (hd0,0) doesn't work
[06:41] <cherubiel> Jager-: just type mount and pastebin it
[06:41] <ahab> you following sysrage?
[06:41] <noldon_> no idea
[06:41] <Kevin`> cherubiel but why dows linux boot
[06:41] <Dheeraj_k> and post the content in paste bin
[06:41] <Kevin`> look at his menu.lst
[06:41] <noldon_> im to tired to think right know
[06:41] <Firefishe> Kevin`:  Is the "kubuntu-desktop" package required to be able to start kde in ubuntu?  I've got the ubuntu/gnome CD I installed from.
[06:41] <cherubiel> Kevin`: lets see where he's mounted his root :)
[06:41] <Jager-> !paste
[06:41] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:41] <Kevin`> cherubiel I guess hdb2
[06:41] <suricate> sysrage_: edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:41] <suricate> enable universe repos
[06:42] <Jager-> Guess how Jager screwed up his linux installation! :D

[06:42] <Music_Shuffle> Firefishe, to ru nKDE, you can just...sudo apt-get install KDE* and that's KDE, and all the libs and progs that are available for it.  Literally...all. ;p
[06:42] <Jager-> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34065/
[06:42] <suricate> sysrage_: after you do that, sudo apt-get update
[06:42] <suricate> apt-get install xchat
[06:42] <sysrage_> suricate: thank you
[06:42] <guest_> I have a dell laptop, PIII 750MHz, 384MB of RAM, should I try xubuntu on it?
[06:42] <Kevin`> guest_ that is up to you
[06:43] <Madpilot> guest_, sure.
[06:43] <Jager-> Jager-
[06:43] <Jager-> :/
[06:43] <Firefishe> Music_Shuffle:  Well, I have just about everything now, but I'm having trouble at startup.  Some problem with file permissions in my home directory.
[06:43] <guest_> I'm thinking of setting it up and giving it to my mom
[06:43] <guest_> I'll have to make sure it'll be a decent laptop
[06:43] <ahab> sysrage hit settings>repositories
[06:43] <ahab> and then add all the repos in the multivrtdr/universe within the "add" tab
[06:43] <Music_Shuffle> No idea then, after I did the KDE* one, it worked fine for me, sorry. =/
[06:43] <ahab> apply and ok that
[06:43] <ahab> give it time to refresh, search for xchat in synaptic and install
[06:43] <guest_> I heard good things about xubuntu, Just gotta try it out
[06:43] <cherubiel> Jager-: lets see fdisk -l /dev/hdb
[06:43] <ahab> or suricate could show you i guess
[06:44] <gradin> hey all i have a quick questions...
[06:44] <Jager-> cherubiel: Cannot open /dev/hdb
[06:44] <Firefishe> Music_Shuffle:  well, I'll try it, it can't hurt.  There's nothing saved on this thing and I can always reinstall...or order a kubuntu cd.  Oh, is kubuntu availablel with a DVD maxi release?
[06:44] <Dheeraj_k> @bill57785: delete every thing from sources.list and enter this in it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34067/
[06:44] <Kevin`> Jager- wtf is up with your computer
[06:44] <Jager-> You've got me
[06:44] <Dheeraj_k> and than run sudo apt-get update
[06:44] <gradin> say i'm on my local machine, is there a way to see how many remote SSL connections there are currently open?
[06:44] <Kevin`> nothing seems to work, yet it's running somehow
[06:44] <Jager-> xD
[06:44] <Music_Shuffle> Kubuntu's always been buggier for me, I prefer to just install Ubuntu and then add in the other window managers manually, Gnome always works. ;)
[06:44] <Kevin`> how does it even boot if grub can't find the hard drive
[06:45] <Jager-> -_-
[06:45] <cherubiel> Jager-: sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdb
[06:45] <Jager-> Ive stumped everyone with my retarded computer :'(
[06:45] <bill57785> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34068/
[06:45] <cherubiel> Jager-: need root perms
[06:45] <bill57785> oh, ok
[06:45] <guest_> cherubiel what does that do
[06:45] <cherubiel> !sudo
[06:45] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:45] <Firefishe> Music_Shuffle:  Ever notice that no matter what distro is comes from, either gnome or kde works better than the other, although most of the other stand-alone window managers do well anyway.
[06:45] <Jager-> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34069/
[06:45] <guest_> !fdisk
[06:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fdisk - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:46] <Firefishe> !dvd
[06:46] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:46] <Music_Shuffle> Yeah ;D
[06:46] <Kevin`> cherubiel fyi, the first thing I tried to have him do was rootnoverify (hd1,0)
[06:46] <zmm> I'm trying to run ant after going in a folder which contains build.xml but I'm getting the error "bash: ant: command not found" how can i get ant work
[06:46] <zmm> "
[06:47] <bill57785> Dheeraj_k: I just realized that I am in the Ubuntu channel...I am running under KDE. Will that affect anything?
[06:47] <kitche> zmm: did you install ant?
[06:47] <guest_> Haha, I man'ed fdisk, and on the manpages, it tells me that 'fdisk is a buggy program and it does fuzzy things' you should use cfdisk instead..that's the manpages for ya
[06:47] <gradin> anybody?
[06:47] <Dheeraj_k> nah even i am using kubuntu
[06:47] <zmm> oh...I thought it's not required....where from can i install ant
[06:47] <gradin> lokoing for way to either log or monitor ssl sessions...
[06:47] <bill57785> ok, cool
[06:47] <Firefishe> Music_Shuffle:  I consider that just plain coder-treachery ;) hee  Anyway, I'll do the apt-get kde* thingy..thanks for the heads up.  It'll ensure that I *finally* have it all, anyway.  If I can't start it, I'll just reinstall.  Then use enlightenment ;) LOL
[06:47] <Kevin`> lol guest_
[06:47] <Kevin`> i've never seen that
[06:47] <kitche> !ant|zmm
[06:47] <ubotu> ant: Java based build tool like make. In component main, is optional. Version 1.6.5-6build1 (edgy), package size 1010 kB, installed size 1200 kB
[06:47] <zoaddka> Hello? I am a new user, How do I stop a media player (sound Juicer) from playing a music CD, can only find pause and play?
[06:48] <thrillin`> how can i resize partition on my mac withouh erasing data...anyone knows?
[06:48] <guest_> Kevin man fdisk and scroll down to the BUGS section
[06:48] <thrillin`> *without
[06:48] <kitche> zmm it's in the repos
[06:48] <cherubiel> thrillin`: gparted
[06:48] <bill57785> ok, saved
[06:48] <cherubiel> thrillin`: get the gparted live cd, works like a charm
[06:48] <Kevin`> guest_ hm indeed
[06:48] <Kevin`> interesting
[06:48] <Dheeraj_k> kubuntu is save as ubuntu only difference is kubuntu has kde where as ubuntu has gnome
[06:48] <Music_Shuffle> Firefishe, best of luck.  I've had much fun trying them all out the past couple days.
[06:48] <Kevin`> I just use fdisk usually because it's simpler to use
[06:49] <Music_Shuffle> Dheeraj_k, not totally true, some people claim there are minor differences in the files that make one or the other work better.  Guess it depends on how much you buy into that.
[06:49] <Dheeraj_k>  bill57785:  sudo apt-get update
[06:49] <Jager-> Kevin' .. How can I just boot into windows using either a boot disk or the windows installer disc?
[06:49] <guest_> It would be interesting to find out the author of that parituclar manpage and ask him if he still believes that's the case
[06:49] <bill57785> yeah I know....just wasn't sure if it would affect anything (I saw you had Dapper Drake in that sources list, so thought I would double check)
[06:49] <guest_> It's probably the same developer who wrote fdisk
[06:49] <zmm> kitche: when i wrote "sudo apt-cache search ant" it showed a long list. can you tell me the exact name of the package
[06:49] <bill57785> ok, that's what I figured you would have me do....I'm finally starting to learn
[06:50] <guest_> Kevin your last name doesn't start with a 'c' does it
[06:50] <Kevin`> Jager- windows isn't smart enough to boot from the install cd :)
[06:50] <Kevin`> guest_ no
[06:50] <Firefishe> Music_Shuffle:  thanks, again :)  it should prove interesting...I enjoy messing about with linux on powerpc..or x86 whatevah :)
[06:50] <kitche> zmm: the package is called ant just do sudo apt-get install ant
[06:50] <guest_> Ok, I guess there ar a lot of kevins around...lol

[06:50] <Kevin`> Jager- grub could do it, but either your not transcribing something correctly or something is very messed up on your computer
[06:50] <thrillin`> [00:51]  <cherubiel> thrillin`: get the gparted live cd, works like a charm <-- i wanna use ubuntu

[06:51] <Jager-> Kevin` is it possible this is all because of the external hdd I had in at one point?
[06:51] <sysrage> can somebody please tell me why every app is making me hit  twice before it shows up?
[06:51] <cherubiel> thrillin`: the gparted live cd is just for partitioning, its *NOT* a full fledged live cd
[06:51] <Kevin`> Jager- had in at one point?
[06:51] <Kevin`> what do you mean
[06:52] <thrillin`> ohhh
[06:52] <Kevin`> is it in now?
[06:52] <Jager-> No
[06:52] <Kevin`> did you install to it?
[06:52] <thrillin`> for mac though
[06:52] <Kevin`> then I doubt it's of any relevance
[06:52] <Jager-> No... no it wasnt in when I installed ubuntu..
[06:52] <Jager-> okay..
[06:52] <CyberSlug> Hello all - is anyone here able to help me write a script to detect whether an external monitor is plugged in?
[06:52] <livingtm> anyone had luck installing edgy 64 onto a software raid?
[06:52] <Dheeraj_k> bill57785: after completing the update run this command sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl gstreamer0.10-plugins-base \ gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse \ gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse w32codecs
[06:52] <DARKGuy> Hi, anybody knows about a program that can limit my bandwidth? I'm on ADSL and I share it with my brother, sooo I need to somehow set up a bw cap for upload/download. Is there any program that can do that? (like Netlimiter - and I've tried apt-cache search bandwidth with no avail, I have no router either, so)
[06:52] <Jager-> Kevin` Will I be ever be able to get back onto windows without formatting all the partitions?
[06:53] <Dheeraj_k> got to go bye :)
[06:53] <Kevin`> DARKGuy you DO have a router, or you wouldn't be able to share the connection =p
[06:53] <Jager-> Kevin` or any at all?
[06:53] <Kevin`> it's probably built into your modem
[06:53] <thrillin`> cherubiel: is this able to work for mac?
[06:53] <DARKGuy> Kevin`: I have an 8-port hub :P
[06:53] <Kevin`> it's probably built into your modem
[06:53] <Kevin`> :)
[06:53] <Kevin`> Jager- I don't know what's wrong.
[06:53] <DARKGuy> Kevin`: Maybe o_o but I don't want to screw it up xD
[06:53] <Jager-> Is h3g3m0n here?
[06:54] <cherubiel> thrillin`: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/features.php
[06:54] <kaiki> DARKGuy: If you want to limit the bandwidth that you are using, you can try squid
[06:54] <cherubiel> DARKGuy: yes, try a proxy
[06:54] <Kevin`> it doesn't make sense that linux would boot, yet doing the same command as the one in the menu file in grub would fair
[06:54] <guest_> Why is the xfce desktop environment more ideal for low end machines?
[06:54] <Kevin`> fail
[06:54] <zmm> It seems as if I don't have root rights on my ubuntu. how to get it.
[06:55] <Kevin`> sudo
[06:55] <DARKGuy> kaiki: cherubiel: I see, gonna search info for it then, thanks xD
[06:55] <suricate> Jager-: could you explain what's your problem again?
[06:55] <thrillin`> thx
[06:55] <thrillin`> i'll dl it now
[06:55] <thrillin`> cherubiel: so u a mac user as well?
[06:55] <Jager-> suricate: i cant boot into windows... it keeps saying "Starting up..."
[06:55] <suricate> Jager-: is windows at another HD?
[06:55] <cherubiel> thrillin`: hfs is mac
[06:55] <thrillin`> i know
[06:55] <Jager-> suricate: No
[06:56] <thrillin`> i askin if u a mac user
[06:56] <cherubiel> thrillin`: so you know the answer :)
[06:56] <zmm> I don't have root rights on my ubuntu. how to get root rights. I get to know this because even to run open office I've to do "sudo ooimpress"
[06:56] <thrillin`> wat u have?
[06:56] <cherubiel> thrillin`: its a live cd, you don't boot into any installed os
[06:56] <maxkelley> hallo, world. Can anyone using the feisty beta tell me if it's fairly stable?
[06:56] <skyfaller-linux> hey guys... I'm having trouble with sound.  I'm suspicious that Ubuntu isn't detecting my sound card or something.  Is there an obvious help page for this that I'm missing?  Anybody wanna help me troubleshoot?
[06:57] <cherubiel> thrillin`: ah that way, nope i'm a debian user
[06:57] <cherubiel> !sound | skyfaller-linux
[06:57] <ubotu> skyfaller-linux: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[06:57] <suricate> Jager-: Are you sure your windows grub entry is correct?
[06:57] <Kevin`> zmm sudo is the recommended way to get root rights. why do you have to view slides as root

[06:57] <bill57785> <DARKG
[06:57] <Jager-> suricate: at this point I have no clue
[06:57] <bill57785> wtf?
[06:57] <suricate> Jager-: could I take a look on it?
[06:58] <Jager-> suricate: please
[06:58] <bill57785> Dheeraj_k: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34073/
[06:58] <skyfaller-linux> cherubiel: thank you :)
[06:58] <suricate> Jager-: paste your menu.lst file somewhere please
[06:58] <Jager-> suricate: what would you like? i will pastbin anything if it will help -_-
[06:58] <skyfaller-linux> I'll check those pages out
[06:58] <thrillin`> nice its done
[06:58] <Jager-> okay
[06:58] <tcli> zmm: sudo /bin/bash;export DISPLAY=":0.0" ...run whatever
[06:58] <thrillin`> lemmie test it
[06:58] <Kevin`> suricate either he isn't transcribing what we've told him to do so far, or his computer is very messed up. typing root (hd0,1) says not found, for example
[06:59] <Kevin`> and that's where linux is booting from
[06:59] <zmm> kevin: I'm writing an extension for open office impress for that I've to bootstrap it from java program. When my java class tries to bootstrap office it gives the same error as i get when i try to start office without sudo from terminal.
[06:59] <thrillin`> thx cherubiel...hopefully nxt time i here it'll b running
[06:59] <guest_> thanks everyone, I'm getting some food now
[06:59] <cherubiel> guest_: nothing for us? :P
[06:59] <Jager-> suricate: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34074/
[06:59] <Kevin`> zmm you really should be able to start office as a normal user
[06:59] <guest_> depends, where od live
[07:00] <guest_> If you're in San Jose I'll think about it :-D
[07:00] <Jager-> kevin` you told me to type root (hd0,1) and push tab, i did that exactly
[07:00] <Kevin`> zmm you could set a password for the root user, and log in as root, but this isn't considered a smart thing to do :)
[07:00] <Kevin`> Jager- no, thats not what I said
[07:00] <Kevin`> I said to type root (hd and press tab
[07:01] <Kevin`> and I said to type root (hd0,1) and press enter
[07:01] <Jager-> Yea.. did that too
[07:01] <Jager-> When I do root (hd and hit tab
[07:01] <Jager-> it just goes down a line and still says root (hd
[07:01] <zmm> kevin: but when i start office as normal user it gives the error which i've pasted at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34075/
[07:01] <tcli> Jager-: Are you sure that your windows partition is (hd0,0)?
[07:01] <tcli> god, this is horrible, I'm addicted to linux support
[07:01] <malt> is it hard to install cpanel on ubuntu?
[07:02] <zmm> kevin: what could be the reason
[07:02] <Kevin`> zmm you didn't do something silly like start it the first time in sudo, did you?
[07:02] <Reality-X> as far as a DHCP server goes, should i use version 3 or version 2?
[07:02] <kitche> malt: umm don't know since cpanel costs money and a lot of money so I don't even use it
[07:02] <guest_> tcli, what does hd0,0 indicate
[07:02] <malt> kitche: what do you use?
[07:02] <Kevin`> i'd assume it's very easy, ask the cpanel people your giving tons of money to
[07:03] <tcli> guest_: First partition on first disk, as seen by the bios
[07:03] <Kevin`> they do give support, yes :)
[07:03] <guest_> Ok thanks tcli
[07:03] <kitche> malt: something that doesn't cost as much money, but I don't use any Virtual host software myself
[07:03] <thrillin`> is it possible to run ubuntu from a thumb drive?
[07:03] <tcli> guest_: typically hda0, or sda0, depending on whether it's a ide or sata/scsi system
[07:03] <Kevin`> malt are you running a hosting company or something with lusers that demand cpanel?
[07:03] <zmm> kevin: yeah, previously I was unable to start open office without sudo ... so I started using sudo to open it
[07:03] <guest_> I think that's the first in my grub liest tcli
[07:03] <Jager-> tcli: this is what my menu.lst shows
[07:03] <Jager-> title		Microsoft Windows XP Professional
[07:03] <Jager-> root		(hd0,0)
[07:04] <DARKGuy> Maaaaaaan, that squid program is a pain to configure :/ isn't there any program that can just limit my download speed that can be turned on and off and easy to configure :S?
[07:04] <guest_> tcli, I know /dev/sda is my hard drive, does BIOS refer to it differently?
[07:04] <malt> Kevin`: nah just a personal server, might host few friends
[07:04] <faiz> hi
[07:04] <zmm> kevin: I don't know what's the problem...I'm unable to start office even from Application's menu
[07:04] <Jager-> DARKGuy: try using netlimiter with wine
[07:04] <Kevin`> malt then wtf do you need a web control panel for
[07:04] <suricate> Jager-: is this your fstab?
[07:04] <suricate> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34065/
[07:04] <thrillin`> i'll bbl
[07:04] <cherubiel> zmm: rm -rf ~/.openoffice.org2
[07:04] <thrillin`> thx for all who helped
[07:04] <guest_> I see what you're saying, BIOS refers to /dev/sda as hd0,0
[07:04] <t35t0r> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1737167 ..still looking for an answer how do i change the xnest window size?
[07:04] <cherubiel> zmm: then try running oowriter again
[07:04] <tcli> Jager-: Run sudo fdisk -l, and take a look at which partitions show as a windows formats (/dev/hda4 will show as windows if you have logical partitions, it's just a placeholder)
[07:04] <malt> Kevin`: just to have, its nice to manager alot of stuff on the server
[07:04] <mborohov> anyone know how i can get the xchat icon on the notification bar in gnome? same place as the gaim icon?
[07:04] <Kevin`> zmm just a guess, try changing the ownership of all files in your home directory to your user
[07:05] <Jager-> Um i dont remember
[07:05] <cafuego_> guest_: It'
[07:05] <DARKGuy> Jager-: ... that's messed o_o but it miiiight work, I hope, anyways xD
[07:05] <Kevin`> malt you must have gotten used to it, eh
[07:05] <cafuego_> s probably drive 0x80 according to yuor bios ;-)
[07:05] <Kevin`> malt poor you :)
[07:05] <zmm> kevin: how to?
[07:05] <t35t0r> if the gdmflexiserver -n resolution cannot be changed at run time how do i change it before it starts?
[07:05] <tcli> DARKGuy: Might wanna check out wondershaper or some other traffic shaping/QoS software
[07:05] <malt> Kevin`: not really i just like control panels
[07:05] <Kevin`> malt I like webmin, but it's had security problems in the past
[07:05] <tcli> DARKGuy: Kinda a pain to set up, but nice once you have it going
[07:05] <cherubiel> zmm: rm -rf ~/.openoffice.org2; oowriter
[07:05] <sysrage> can anybody tell me wtf is wrong? single quote is not acting as single quote. it is either putting accents over letters or doing a backquote
[07:05] <Kevin`> so use it with an ssh tunnel
[07:05] <malt> sometimes its quickser then ssh, telling someone how to create a db or something'
[07:05] <cafuego_> DARKGuy: For single downloads, run them via 'trickle'.
[07:05] <malt> quicker*
[07:06] <Kevin`> malt for a db, just use phpmyadmin
[07:06] <Jager-> tcli: only one is ntfs, /dev/hdb1
[07:06] <cherubiel> sysrage: are you using a ' or a ` ?
[07:06] <cafuego_> DARKGuy: Ie: 'trickle -d 64 wget http://somefile.on/some/host'
[07:06] <sysrage> trying to use single quote. the first one you typed. but it is not showing as that
[07:06] <tcli> control panels are the bane of my existence :<
[07:06] <DARKGuy> tcli: Ah, so they're called traffic shapers o.o; I shall search about wondershaper and tricke - btw, cafuego_, is tricke compatible with apt-get downloads ?
[07:06] <kitche> mail look up myPanel or any other open source control panel
[07:06] <kitche> malt*
[07:06] <cherubiel> sysrage: how are you using it?
[07:06] <cherubiel> zmm: any luck?
[07:06] <zmm> cherubiel: "rm -rf ~/.openoffice.org2; oowriter" what's it for

[07:54] <Virtuall> mborohov, yep, Warsow
[07:54] <Burgundavia> TokenBad: headers is not the source
[07:54] <Virtuall> thjat's an OpenGL game
[07:54] <TokenBad> weird..that it what it told me to install
[07:55] <Burgundavia> TokenBad: headers is needed if you are compiling a kernel module
[07:55] <KingDillyDilly> +w
[07:55] <Virtuall> and Beryl tries to make effect on it's "window". which of course fails and the whole X goes bye-bye
[07:55] <Virtuall> :(
[07:55] <KingDillyDilly> sorry. Don't know what I'm doing
[07:56] <TokenBad> Burgundavia, ok so to install source I need to apt-get install linux-source?
[07:56] <Burgundavia> TokenBad: yes. but what are you trying to isntall
[07:56] <Burgundavia> ?
[07:56] <sysrage> how do you search with apt-get?

[07:58] <sysrage> why does apt-cache search kernel show stuff completely unrelated?
[07:58] <Burgundavia> SilentDis: there are a number of ways. You can login via VNC
[07:59] <Burgundavia> or XDMCP
[07:59] <TokenBad> ok installed linux-source but still get same error
[07:59] <SilentDis> Burgundavia: VNC would just 'port' my current desktop to it though, right?  i'd actually like to have it log in as a seperate session.
[08:00] <Burgundavia> SilentDis: vnc can do either
[08:00] <Burgundavia> vino, built into the desktop, does the former
[08:00] <Burgundavia> install another vnc server to do the latter
[08:00] <TokenBad> Burgundavia, installed linux-source but it still says can't find linux kernal source on install
[08:00] <TokenBad> well config even
[08:00] <SilentDis> Burgundavia:  any howtos on this?  I don't wanna take up the channel with it, obviously :)

[08:02] <mbb> just used Synaptic to add gnucash to my edgy and breezy systems. on breezy, gnucash appears in the Office programs group (as expected) but does not appear on any menu on Edgy. Ideas?
[08:02] <pradeep> mborohov, yep
[08:02] <SilentDis> sysrage:  that sounds more like what I'd be looking for... could you point me to a howto or the like?
[08:02] <wastrel> SilentDis:  you can ssh to the remote machine and run programs off of it
[08:02] <sysrage> just enable it in sshd config, ssh -X to the box, and run an app
[08:02] <SilentDis> wastrel:  I'm doing that now.  it's a simple terminal though, I'd like a GUI for it
[08:02] <wastrel> SilentDis:  no need to run a full desktop session
[08:03] <wastrel> SilentDis:  you can open GUI progs remotely i mean , with ssh -X like sysrage said
[08:03] <SilentDis> wastrel:  ahhh, that sounds excellent.  just port over Gaim or the like :)
[08:03] <tcli> SilentDis: Hrm, you could start a separate X session for the remote user
[08:03] <tcli> SilentDis: xhost +(remote ip) on X machine
[08:04] <tcli> SilentDis: then just export DISPLAY=X ip:1 (assuming it's the second X session)
[08:04] <tcli> or set up X11 forwarding via ssh for more security
[08:04] <Jbirk> Has anyone here tried the sonicare?
[08:05] <tcli> er... :0.1?

[08:29] <tonyyarusso> Cool - if you run the edgy installer on a system that already had Ubuntu, it auto-detects the hostname
[08:29] <runes> I know I asked this already but....where is the apt program located?
[08:30] <LaserLine> tcli: dmesg?  i'm fairly new to linux, but i've been running ubuntu for 6+ months now this is just when the problem occured
[08:30] <tcli> LaserLine: run 'sudo dmesg'... it'll give you a log of recent system messages

[08:32] <LaserLine> tcli: i don't see any
[08:32] <tcli> LaserLine: That's good news for the drive
[08:33] <tcli> LaserLine: Usually if you have sporadic boot problems like that it's heat-related, and probably an issue with the proc
[08:33] <LaserLine> tcli:  I see a lot of ones like this: [17179942.596000]  atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e059 <keycode>' to make it known.
[08:33] <tcli> that doesn't look bad... prolly just a random issue with your keymap

=== samurai is now known as samiam
[08:34] <fyrestrtr> LaserLine: yeap, you'll get those a lot. Its an issue with the F-lock or media keys, I haven't figured out which yet.
[08:34] <tcli> try taking the side panel off (assuming it's not under warranty or something) and see if that helps (it'll cool the system down, and if it's heat-related, should make it boot more reliably)
[08:35] <fyrestrtr> turbopc: http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html
[08:35] <tcli> LaserLine: Also, are you getting any kind of weird graphical issues when it hangs on boot, or any kind of error messages?
[08:35] <frogzoo> turbopc: maybe you don't have libdvdcss?
[08:36] <LaserLine> no, it will hang when it first says Ubuntu and the progress bar will hang... also i don't think it's heat related because it will freeze randomly not when it's been on for a while and is hot
[08:36] <turbopc> fyrestrtr: I chekd it! and I dont seem to be getting the proper results

[08:37] <tcli> LaserLine: So it's not crashing or freezing once it boots?
[08:37] <fyrestrtr> runes: no, but what is your boot problem?
[08:37] <boink> and firefox 2 on dapper?
[08:37] <commander_tux> boink, parker`: I'm using flash 9.... it's terrible to Firefox. Worth it, but terrible. :-p
[08:37] <parker`> boink: firefox 2 on edgy, it actually started crashing after I did an auto-install of flash from within firefox
[08:37] <LaserLine> tcli: actually it will freeze when after it boots too and it's kinda random, but it seems like every time I'm doing something with sound
[08:38] <boink> parker: then take out the flash
[08:38] <boink> and use the ubuntu .deb for flash
[08:38] <parker`> boink: how can I accomplish this?
[08:38] <boink> with apt-get
[08:38] <runes> fyrestrtr, ok I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 all good ..then in gnome it said there wre updates..so I did them..system hug when trying to log in  so I went to console and tried to repair the desktop..that blew up and now I can't get anything to work
[08:38] <boink> you'll need to check if your /etc/apt/sources.list is in order for that
[08:38] <tcli> LaserLine: Well, if it's not proc-related, my next guess would be RAM, but it could be a bad sound card as well (usually those won't cause the whole system to go down, but i've seen stranger things)... might wanna try pulling out the sound card and seeing if that resolves it
[08:39] <fyrestrtr> runes: what did you try to do when you tried to repair your desktop?
[08:39] <LaserLine> tcli, it's integrated :(
[08:39] <parker`> boink: I am using a default sources.list, which repo do I need to add to get flash?
[08:39] <boink> just a sec ...
[08:39] <fyrestrtr> parker`: read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[08:40] <tcli> LaserLine: Hm... can you disable it in the bios?
[08:40] <parker`> and how can I remove the version of flash I installed since I installed it from within firefox, I don't think apt will know about it
[08:40] <runes> fyrestrtr, there are three ways apt, aptitude and the third is the one I used
[08:40] <boink> http://cuba.calyx.nl/~oink/ubuntu-sources.list <= this is mine. you should fix if for where you are
[08:40] <parker`> thanks
[08:40] <fyrestrtr> runes: what synaptic ?
[08:40] <runes> fyrestrtr, no command from terminal
[08:40] <runes> ls
[08:40] <runes> sec..
[08:40] <boink> and then man apt-get
[08:41] <LaserLine> tcli: yeah i can see if that helps... also on a side note if gnome freezes is the dmesg thing is where i should look for the error?
[08:41] <fyrestrtr> runes: I need to know what you did to try and fix it.
[08:41] <fyrestrtr> LaserLine: ~/.xsession-errors and /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[08:41] <runes> fyrestrtr, there was a shell command that runs an app like aptitude
[08:41] <fyrestrtr> runes: where did you find out about it?
[08:42] <InvisiblePinkUni> !wget
[08:42] <ubotu> wget: retrieves files from the web. In component main, is standard. Version 1.10.2-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 226 kB, installed size 1952 kB
[08:42] <mborohov> so what are the philosophy differences between beryl and compiz?
[08:42] <defrysk> topic is gone ?
[08:42] <runes> fyrestrtr  using help at the prompt
[08:42] <fyrestrtr> mborohov: #ubuntu-xgl
[08:42] <mborohov> fair enough :)
[08:43] <Phuzion> I have a Sony Vaio PCG-9E1L and I need to update my drivers for my video card, what site would you recommend that I go to?
[08:43] <turbopc> fyrestrtr: I followed the instructions and installed required packages - Totem still gives me the error :(
[08:43] <frogzoo> Phuzion: use the repos
[08:43] <frogzoo> Phuzion: ati?
[08:43] <Phuzion> yeah
[08:43] <Phuzion> rage mobility
[08:43] <tcli> LaserLine: no problem
[08:43] <frogzoo> !seveas | Phuzion
[08:43] <ubotu> Phuzion: Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages. More info (and mirrors) on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[08:44] <TokenBad> how can I tell what network driver is being used by ubuntu?
[08:44] <frogzoo> Phuzion: if you can run fglrx, get the latest from the seveas repo
[08:44] <LaserLine> tcli: yeah thanks... i'll see what i can try to make this thing stop freezing
[08:44] <tcli> TokenBad: lsmod
[08:44] <frogzoo> TokenBad: it's mentioned on load in /var/log/messages
[08:44] <frogzoo> TokenBad: also, 'lsmod'
[08:44] <TokenBad> lsmod
[08:44] <LaserLine> btw anyone know is SATA II is backward compatible with sata I
[08:45] <Phuzion> frogzoo:  I'll take a look at those repositories, thanks
[08:45] <tcli> LaserLine: as far as I know... would be pretty silly if not, heh
[08:45] <frogzoo> LaserLine: definitely
[08:45] <LaserLine> thanks
[08:46] <TokenBad> ok typed the lsmod but not sure how to tell which is for my network card
[08:47] <tcli> TokenBad: msg me the output
[08:47] <User2> hey
[08:48] <User2> can anyone tell me if ubuntu is safe for online transactions (ie, credit cards, online purchase, etc)?
[08:48] <wastrel> i like ubuntu
[08:48] <concept10> TokenBad, what type of network card are you using?
[08:48] <User2> I'm considering converting
[08:48] <concept10> TokenBad, lspci
[08:48] <InvisiblePinkUni> i like ubotu :)
[08:48] <User2> and... does it support all common features automatically?
[08:48] <parker`> User2: it would be pretty useless if it wasn't secure enough for online transactions
[08:48] <User2> like upnp?
[08:48] <User2> yeah
[08:48] <wastrel> User2:  ubuntu has ssl just like windows or mac, so your transactions are protected just the same way
[08:48] <User2> but I dunno the 411 on this thing
[08:48] <User2> oh
[08:49] <User2> firewall capabilities?
[08:49] <User2> I know windows has a built in one
[08:49] <wastrel> built-in firewall yes
[08:49] <runes> If I was to dl server (lamp) would I be able to use apt-get to load the desktop
[08:49] <Jordan_U> User2: Of course :)
[08:49] <User2> and... wireless networking I would hope
[08:49] <User2> fo real?
[08:49] <InvisiblePinkUni> User2: Ubuntu is definitely safer than windoze :)
[08:49] <Jordan_U> User2: Of course :)
[08:49] <User2> shiiit
[08:49] <turbopc> is there anyone here that can actually help me instead of pasting the links thru ubotu?
[08:49] <boink> you mean hold your hand?
[08:49] <User2> hmm, so which is the best distribution of linux in your opinion for a home user?
[08:49] <wastrel> wifi is a bit tricky for some hardware - vendors don't always supply drivers for their cards.
[08:49] <InvisiblePinkUni> User2: but it doesnt help if you keep your passwords in the open....
[08:49] <Jordan_U> turbopc: What's your problem?
[08:50] <InvisiblePinkUni> turbopc: ask
[08:50] <wastrel> User2:  you won't get an unbiased answer to that question here.... :]   ubuntu of course
[08:50] <boink> !ask
[08:50] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:50] <tcli> user2: openbsd
[08:50] <solid_liq> anyone know of a channel for nxserver/freenx?
[08:50] <tcli> j/k :P
[08:50] <turbopc> Jordan_U: / InvisiblePinkUni: I have followed all the steps to instal libdvdcss but i still get the problem in Totem asking if im trying to play encrypted DVD without libdvdcss
[08:50] <User2> .. lol
[08:50] <boink> turbopc: then use mplayer
[08:50] <User2> Well... I mean security wise
[08:50] <boink> mplayer plays dvd's with no problem
[08:51] <User2> but that is so awesome if it has a built in firewall already
[08:51] <TokenBad> concept10, its onboard lan
[08:51] <TokenBad> tcli, you get my msg?
[08:51] <tcli> they're all secure if you keep your software updated, systems locked down, and use strong passwords
[08:51] <tcli> yeah
[08:51] <Jordan_U> turbopc: You ran sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh ?
[08:51] <turbopc> boink: but u still need libdvdcss - right?
[08:51] <tcli> forgot how many modules pcs have, lol
[08:51] <boink> of course
[08:51] <tcli> used to servers
[08:51] <boink> and ubuntu doesn't come with that
[08:51] <turbopc> Jordan_U: yes I did... no errors
[08:51] <User2> since it's open source.. when one flaw is found don't all vendors generally report it to linux
[08:51] <User2> ?
[08:51] <concept10> TokenBad, what does it show with lspci?
[08:51] <boink> you'll need to adjust your sources.list for that
[08:51] <Jordan_U> turbopc: And you restarted totem-xine?
[08:51] <User2> I'm really excited to try out linux.. I just need some pointers
[08:51] <boink> !codecs
[08:51] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:51] <User2> so I feel secure with this change
[08:51] <wastrel> User2:  the built-in firewall is part of the linux kernel, it's turned off by default in ubuntu so you'd have to enable it, but it's there...
[08:52] <boink> the ubuntu desktop is more convient than the OpenBSD desktop
[08:52] <boink> up and running in 10 minutes :)
[08:52] <Phuzion> frogzoo:  so I just do apt-get install fglrx and the drivers should update for me?
[08:52] <runes> wastrel, if I was to install server is it wasy to then load gnome?
[08:52] <User2> Thanks westel
[08:52] <TokenBad> concept10, don't find that at all in my output
[08:52] <InvisiblePinkUni> User2: start with the LIVE CD, and then slowly use ubuntu and ditch windows :)
[08:52] <boink> you don't want gmone on a server.
[08:52] <boink> that's silly
[08:52] <User2> live cd?
[08:52] <turbopc> Jordan_U: any ideas as of what could've been wrong?
[08:53] <Jordan_U> User2: Just don't expect it to work exactly like windows and you should be fine.
[08:53] <wastrel> runes:  you can install ubuntu-desktop  and it will pull in everything you need for gnome
[08:53] <User2> Yeah, I'm fairly computer literate
[08:53] <User2> the terms arn't entirely jibberish I hope
[08:53] <runes> wastrel, but not as much as the desktop installation cd??
[08:53] <TokenBad> concept10, nVidia Corporation nForce2 Ethernet Controller
[08:53] <concept10> TokenBad, you dont see anything that says Network controller?
[08:53] <InvisiblePinkUni> User2: live cd its the same now as install cd, me am still lagging :o
[08:53] <wastrel> runes:  not sure.  i never used the desktop cd :] 
[08:53] <concept10> TokenBad, oh
[08:53] <tcli> TokenBad: forcedeth
[08:53] <boink> you have the "alternate" install CD too
[08:54] <Jordan_U> User2: Believe it or not that is a good thing, Windows "power users" are often frustratred that all they have learned in windows doesn't necisarily apply in Ubuntu.
[08:54] <`QXL> hello
[08:54] <User2> erm... but what is this I hear about knoppix?
[08:54] <runes> wastrel ah ok but it's doable, good enough will save me time rather than installing desktop then configuring all the server apps
[08:54] <boink> sure, knoppix is a good distro too
[08:54] <tcli> knoppix is nice for a cd-based distro
[08:54] <wastrel> i haven't used knoppix in years
[08:54] <sysrage> wow. first distro i've ever used that didn't come with ssh
[08:54] <tcli> gentoo is nice if you're patient and have solid linux skills
[08:54] <User2> knoppix is for a first time use demo of linux, no?
[08:54] <User2> doesn't install I heard
[08:54] <concept10> TokenBad, yeah, why dont you paste the output of lsmod.  otherwise you could do modinfo <drivername> and find out for yourself
[08:55] <wastrel> sysrage:  weird eh :]   install openssh-server
[08:55] <Phuzion> i just used Knoppix 4.0 as a recovery CD to save files off of a crashed Windows box
[08:55] <boink> yes, it's like ubuntu. based on debian
[08:55] <tcli> you can do a hd install of knoppix easily too
[08:55] <turbopc> Jordan_U: so... any idea of how to run the dvd although i have the libdvdcss installed?
[08:55] <sysrage> wastrel: ya i did.. just can't imagine why they didn't include it
[08:55] <User2> does ubuntu have anything like that?
[08:55] <Phuzion> so, how do I install updated ATI drivers with these special seveas repositories?
[08:55] <User2> A demo boot up that is
[08:55] <tcli> concept10: it's forcedeth :P
[08:55] <wastrel> sysrage:  i think it's a "security" feature - no servers turned on by default.
[08:55] <boink> anything like what?
[08:55] <wastrel> !ati
[08:55] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:55] <User2> yeah, I think that may be a good thing that the power users don't know much.. I mean... less likely to hack right?
[08:55] <concept10> tcli, thats the driver name?
[08:55] <Jordan_U> turbopc: Again, just to be sure, you completely restarted totem right?
[08:55] <TokenBad> see here is why trying to find out...am trying to use parallels workstation and installed dream linux to test....but can't get it to connect to inet...and in info says would have to install drivers for other os's besides their supported ones...
[08:56] <User2> My friend is trying to tell me that ubuntu is hack free... yay or nay?
[08:56] <User2> I never heard of a full proof os
[08:56] <boink> "hack free" .. that's funny
[08:56] <`QXL> people, can you help me? i downloaded kcontrol package from packages.ubuntu.com but it destroyed and system puts error, where i can found this packet, i use ubuntu dapper 6.06
[08:56] <turbopc> Jordan_U: yes... I even restarted the whole system!
[08:56] <User2> I KNOW!
[08:56] <`QXL> ?
[08:56] <User2> I was like... wtf
[08:56] <boink> silly
[08:56] <Jordan_U> User2: Yes ubuntu has a 'Live CD"
[08:56] <User2> How about spyware?
[08:56] <boink> c'mon
[08:56] <tcli> lol
[08:56] <wastrel> isn't the livecd called the desktop cd now ?
[08:57] <tcli> there's no spyware on linux
[08:57] <boink> spyware is only written for windows
[08:57] <Jordan_U> wastrel: Yes.
[08:57] <User2> I use firefox anyway, but let's assume a website is being a ... insert profane word of choice
[08:57] <boink> like with viruses, they're only written for windows
[08:57] <tcli> concept10: yeah
[08:57] <concept10> TokenBad, oh, so you would need to load the forcedeth module inside of the virtual install I guess
[08:57] <User2> seriously?
[08:57] <User2> ;o
[08:57] <parker`> sweet everything works now (flash and firefox) thanks guys
[08:57] <tcli> concept10: It's the onboard nvidia driver
[08:57] <User2> there are NO viruses affecting linux?
[08:57] <boink> parker: ubuntu isn't so tolerant when you do your "own" thing
[08:57] <wastrel> User2:  you can download all the windows viruses and spyware you want, it's not going to run :] 
[08:58] <User2> sweeeet
[08:58] <boink> I had Flash 9 installed, it wasn't that good
[08:58] <concept10> TokenBad, well, try to modprobe forcedeth
[08:58] <User2> but are their custom built ones?
[08:58] <Jordan_U> User2: It isn't as much that Linux does not have viruses, it is that Windows is the only OS that DOES :)
[08:58] <User2> for ubuntu.. i mean
[08:58] <wastrel> there are viruses but they're proof-of-concept things that aren't circulating in the wild.
[08:58] <boink> if you use wine, those viruses will run :)
[08:58] <User2> lol
[08:58] <wastrel> and wouldn't work well anyway
[08:58] <parker`> one last question, I have the multiverse repo enabled but I can't get Sun JDK to install... I am reading the wiki here and it says the package is named "sun-java5-jdk" but this returns 0 results, what is the proper name
[08:58] <boink> again, you need the right repo
[08:58] <boink> !java
[08:58] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[08:58] <User2> rep?
[08:58] <TokenBad> concept10, yeah the dream linux is debian based to...just have to figure out how to get the file into the vm
[08:58] <boink> User2: man apt-get
[08:58] <wastrel> parker`:  did you apt-get update after you enabled multiverse ?
[08:59] <tcli> user2: There are like 5 linux viruses, only one that I know of that has ever made it into the wild, and it affected like 0.01% of linux boxen
[08:59] <User2> lol
[08:59] <User2> so you would probably have to deliberately try to get these suckers
[08:59] <boink> debian/ubuntu has a system called "apt-get" which is like pkg_add in the BSD's
[08:59] <boink> User2: no
[08:59] <User2> those*
[08:59] <User2> erm..
[08:59] <Jordan_U> User2 pretty much :)
[08:59] <User2> so then what do you recommend I get as a backup safety measure
[08:59] <boink> apt-get comes from debian
[08:59] <User2> for a firewall that is
[08:59] <floating> fyrestrtr: on xiterm manual, it says kanji mode as -km mode and kanji font -ft fontname, but if I run xiterm with those options, what kanji font I can/have ?
[08:59] <tcli> user2: yeah... it's pretty much unheard of
[08:59] <concept10> TokenBad, the drivers are already included with every linux kernel, just modprobe forcedeth
[09:00] <goosfraba4u> hi, how to set up a gateway
[09:00] <User2> I don't even need a virus scanner?
[09:00] <tcli> user2: the hacks I see are all webapp/php vulnerabilities, or weak passwords
[09:00] <boink> backup: rsnapshop firewall: iptables
[09:00] <Jordan_U> User2: And because softwate comes from repositories you can trust 100% everyting youi install.
[09:00] <boink> heh, 100 percent? heh
[09:00] <parker`> wastrel: I believe so, let me try again
[09:00] <goosfraba4u> Hi guys, how do I go about setting up a gateway?
[09:00] <boink> !gateway
[09:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gateway - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:00] <User2> repositories?  could you enlighten my vocabulary:p
[09:00] <Jordan_U> boink: To not be malware that is, nothing more guarenteed.
[09:00] <concept10> TokenBad, did you try it?
[09:00] <`QXL> people, can you help me? i downloaded kcontrol package from packages.ubuntu.com but it destroyed and system puts error, where i can found this packet, i use ubuntu dapper 6.06. ??
[09:00] <boink> User2: man apt-get
[09:00] <wastrel> !repos
[09:00] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:01] <parker`> wastrel: okay I updated and tried again, same problem... E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-jdk
[09:01] <User2> man apt-get?
[09:01] <Phuzion> Can someone walk me through updating the driver for my ATI Rage Mobility card?
[09:01] <User2> I never heard of that term
[09:01] <User2> sorry
[09:01] <boink> well, read it.
[09:01] <boink> it's all in the man page
[09:01] <Phuzion> !man
[09:01] <ubotu> The "man" command brings up the Linux manual pages for the command you're interested in. Try "man intro" at the command line, or see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands

[09:01] <TokenBad> concept10, I would do that from terminal in vm?
[09:01] <Phuzion> there's everything you need to know about man apt-get
[09:01] <goosfraba4u> !boink
[09:01] <concept10> boink, Phuzion he doesnt have it installed yet
[09:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about boink - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:01] <wastrel> parker`:  you must not have multiverse enabled :]    check your sources.list carefully....
[09:02] <boink> !java
[09:02] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[09:02] <concept10> TokenBad, yep
[09:02] <boink> and read that
[09:02] <User2> oh - you mean ubotu will tell me what I need if I use the man -aptget
[09:02] <User2> feature
[09:02] <wastrel> !ati | Phuzion
[09:02] <ubotu> Phuzion: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:02] <TokenBad> concept10, thanks will try it...
[09:02] <parker`> User2: you may want to give this a read to understand a few differences between linux and windows http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
[09:02] <TokenBad> will let you know
[09:02] <goosfraba4u> boink: It dosen't know crap about gateways, do you?
[09:02] <Phuzion> wastrel:  read it, I'm confused as hell
[09:02] <concept10> TokenBad, ok
[09:02] <Phuzion> which is why I need someone to walk me through it
[09:02] <boink> goosfraba4u: you'll need to set up iptables in order to make a gateway
[09:02] <wastrel> Phuzion:  i'm just using what's in the repos.  isn't there a seveas section on that page?
[09:03] <boink> !iptables
[09:03] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[09:03] <Phuzion> yeah, but I don't get how to get a specific driver for a card from the repositories

[09:04] <wastrel> <3 ubotu
[09:04] <Phuzion> Yeah, but the bots should be required to notice or PM
[09:04] <wastrel> !msgthebot
[09:04] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[09:04] <wastrel> :] 
[09:05] <concept10> they help, but they are also annoying, especially when you dont pay attention to what someones asking and you just throw up a lame bot message
[09:05] <boink> happens in a busy channel
[09:05] <TokenBad> concept10, ok it gave no responce that good or bad?
[09:05] <Phuzion> wastrel: I know, but when you do something like !ati | Phuzion then it publicly says it in the channel
[09:06] <Phuzion> I think that all bots should be required to always stick to msg or notice
[09:06] <User2> Thanks for all of the info guys
[09:06] <sortadi> hi there
[09:06] <concept10> TokenBad, it shouldnt give no response if successful... you could do another lsmod and you should see the driver (module) loaded
[09:06] <User2> forgive the delayed response.. windows update loading x.x
[09:06] <rokko> hi: my parallel port keeps sending info to my ticket printer (dot matrix), but its a very huge file because of text format, how can i stop it?
[09:06] <concept10> TokenBad, and then try again with whatever you were attempting to do
[09:06] <sortadi> I am experiencing problems getting to dowload ubuntu 6.10 cd iso
[09:06] <Reality-X> whats the command to have a service start at boot time?
[09:06] <Phuzion> So, is someone going to help me out with my video card driver issue?  I'm running an ATI Rage Mobility and apparently I don't have drivers for it yet.
[09:06] <Phuzion> sortadi: what method are you using to download the iso?
[09:06] <parker`> okay so I definitely have the multiverse repo enabled, but I still can't find the package "sun-java5-jdk" as the wiki suggested would work, any ideas? (I have updated the package list already)
[09:07] <sortadi> when i go to any of the available mirrors i just get garbage when trying to dld
[09:07] <sortadi> Phuzion, through regular webpage
[09:07] <Phuzion> hmm
[09:07] <sortadi> Phuzion, http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/pub/linux/ubuntu/releases/edgy/
[09:07] <boink> parker: do an apt-cache search sun-java5
[09:07] <User2> hmm... just one more question... is upnp supported?  by default?  or do I look for an open source version?  (and btw.. can cookie stealers and malware of any asort be in open source linuxware)?  (okay I guess this was more than one question)
[09:08] <wastrel> parker`:  at this point you should pastebin your sources.list & let us have a look at it :] , sun-java5-jdk is definitely in multiverse
[09:08] <wastrel> !info sun-java5-jdk
[09:08] <ubotu> sun-java5-jdk: Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.5.0-08-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 4918 kB, installed size 11412 kB
[09:08] <Phuzion> sortadi:  are you saving the file as, or just clicking on it?
[09:08] <boink> I think parker isn't putting in the right thing with apt-get install
[09:08] <sortadi> Phuzion, clicking
[09:08] <boink> that's why he should do an apt-cache search sun-java5
[09:08] <Phuzion> whats the url you're clicking on?
[09:08] <Reality-X> IE in gentoo its rc-update add <service> default to get it to start at boot time
[09:08] <concept10> Phuzion, what type of card do you have?
[09:08] <boink> sun-java5-bin - Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
[09:08] <sortadi> Phuzion, ok saving the file as now.. thanks
[09:08] <parker`> boink: I want the jdk not the jre
[09:09] <Phuzion> concept10:  ati rage mobility inside a sony vaio pcg-9e1l
[09:09] <boink> sun-java5-jdk - Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0
[09:09] <boink> again, check your sources.list
[09:09] <boink> apt-cache search sun-java5-jdk
[09:09] <concept10> Phuzion, are you using linux right now?
[09:09] <Phuzion> yes
[09:09] <Phuzion> 6.06
[09:10] <parker`> I took comments out to imrpove readability: http://rafb.net/paste/results/mVI7Vj49.html
[09:10] <parker`> improve, even
[09:10] <parker`> the apt-cache search returns no results
[09:10] <concept10> Phuzion, I think the driver is called 'r128'  You hsould get a better response if you detail what exact problem you are having (what are you trying to fix)
[09:11] <Phuzion> well, I installed Google Earth today, and apparently I have no video card driver installed, according to the program
[09:11] <wastrel> parker`:  you only have multiverse enabled for the edgy-backports repos
[09:11] <parker`> wastrel: what URL do I need to enter for the general multiverse?
[09:11] <pepeamid> hello !!
[09:12] <tcli> heheh
[09:12] <wastrel> parker`:  add multiverse to the first 2 lines
[09:12] <Phuzion> parker`:  anywhere you see the word universe in sources.list, add the word multiverse after it, separated by one space, then save, close, and run sudo apt-get update
[09:12] <tcli> <--- on windoze
[09:12] <tcli> i use windows way too much
[09:12] <parker`> I've read the wiki already, but it just walks you though enabling it through software instead of giving you details
[09:12] <tcli> i think i'm a masochist
[09:12] <pepeamid> how i can change the controls on edgy with beryl  and emerald
[09:12] <tcli> i even have my dual-boot setup to use the windoze bootloader, just for the hell of it
[09:12] <wastrel> i don't think multiverse gets security updates, so you can add it to the security lines but it won't do anything :] 
[09:12] <coz_> pepeamid, could you explain that a little more?
[09:12] <Phuzion> tcli:  I dual boot XP and Ubuntu 6.06
[09:13] <Phuzion> You're not a masochist, lol
[09:13] <coz_> tcli, I agree   people who use windows either have work they need to get done or they play alot of games
[09:13] <tcli> Phuzion: well, I like people to punch m e in the face too
[09:13] <tcli> j/k :p
[09:13] <Phuzion> haha
[09:13] <User2> dual boot.. that means you only use one at a time?
[09:14] <Phuzion> yes
[09:14] <pepeamid> yeah coz_ , when i upgrade to edgy, the controls of windows , like clearlooks theme
[09:14] <tcli> i just set up winxp/6.10
[09:14] <parker`> ahh there we go, sorry for the dumb question guys
[09:14] <pepeamid> how i can change ?
[09:14] <tcli> i haven't had a linux box since i dumped a glass of water into my gentoo laptop :<
[09:14] <coz_> pepeamid, ok you did type   beryl-manager in the terminal to start it right?
[09:14] <tcli> well, I have linux servers, but no linux workstation :P
[09:15] <Phuzion> tcli:  ouch on the laptop
[09:15] <pepeamid> yes
[09:15] <rc-1> is there a log of this, i missed a message to me
[09:15] <tcli> Phuzion: yeah, I had it all pimped out too... everyone who saw it was in awe
[09:15] <tcli> *sigs*
[09:15] <coz_> pepeamid, ok and you see the large icon next to the clock
[09:15] <tcli> er... sighs
[09:15] <fredl> which file adds /usr/local/bin to my path? :/
[09:16] <fredl> it looks to be default.
[09:16] <Phuzion> tcli:  just a heads up, if you're going to continue to talk about offtopic stuff, might I suggest #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:16] <pepeamid> yeah
[09:16] <floating> I tried installing kon, but when running "you can run this Kon at only console termina.
[09:16] <tcli> Phuzion: ty
[09:16] <bokey> fredl, check your ~/.bashrc
[09:16] <Phuzion> tcli:  np
[09:16] <rc-1> wheres the log of this channel?
[09:16] <fredl> bokey - did that.
[09:16] <pepeamid> its normal all my edgy
[09:16] <coz_> pepeamid, if you want a clearlooks kind of window frame you may have to down load the beryl theme for that, I have it but I don;'t know if I donwloaded it or it came default
[09:16] <bokey> fredl, put path variable there then.
[09:17] <fredl> bokey - it's set elsewhere and I want to know where.
[09:17] <tcli> fredl: Add: export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
[09:17] <Grant> Hey guys question: If I need to install grub from the terminal so that it installs onto the MBR of sda, and boots into sda3, what are the commands?
[09:18] <pepeamid> ok coz_ , emerald only cahnge my windows decorations, but dont change the controls
[09:18] <fredl> tcli - I know that. I just want to know where it's currently set because I don't think /usr/local/bin should be at the start of any user's path
[09:18] <coz_> dobie_gillis, i haven;t heard that name in decades lol
[09:18] <tcli> Grant: is /boot /dev/sda1?
[09:19] <Phuzion>  concept10:  how do I go about installing the 'r128' driver?
[09:19] <Grant> tcli: not sure what you are asking... according to gparted sda1 is my NTFS mass storage partition
[09:19] <bokey> fredl, /etc/profile
[09:20] <concept10> Phuzion, it maybe installed already ... do a lsmod  and see if its listed
[09:20] <pepeamid> coz_, metacity dont works too, for change controls theme
[09:20] <fredl> bokey - not there either for me.
[09:20] <Grant> tcli: what I need is for grub to be installed onto the MBR of sda and to boot to the sda3 partition
[09:20] <coz_> pepeamid, no metacity does not work with beryl ..correct
[09:20] <rokko> how can i cancel a job in lpd?
[09:20] <wastrel> fredl:  bash manpage sez :  The default path is  system-dependent,  and  is set  by  the administrator who installs bash.
[09:21] <Phuzion> concept10:  I don't see it there
[09:21] <pepeamid> coz_, i change the windows manager for test
[09:21] <fredl> bokey - and also not in /etc/bash.bashrc
[09:21] <tamiya> Hey guys, check out my blog at http://unrealfantasy.blogspot.com/
[09:21] <tcli> fredl: try grep -Ri PATH= /etc/* 2>/dev/null
[09:21] <pepeamid> but neither change
[09:21] <fredl> wastrel, well I installed bash :)
[09:21] <tcli> don't have a ubuntu box handy or i'd tell you :P
[09:21] <yoshiznit123> hi everyone, is there a way to play a sound file so that it gets heard on the recording device?
[09:21] <bokey> fredl, do a search for .bashrc. find / -name .bashrc -print
[09:21] <tamiya> Hey guys, check out my blog at http://unrealfantasy.blogspot.com/
[09:21] <pepeamid> only change the windows title
[09:21] <tcli> Grant: You need to know where the kernel image/initrd are stored
=== cari_tmn_ce is now known as ce_nduth
[09:22] <pepeamid> or header wherever
[09:22] <thirstyferret> hi all... I have a .py script but I can't seem to get python to run it... bit of a beginner at python, so how do I get it to run? thanks :)
[09:22] <coz_> pepeamid, ok if i understand... you tried to change the window manager and now none of it works?
[09:22] <Zimka> hi all
[09:22] <wastrel> fredl:  strings /bin/bash | grep /usr/local   - suggests it's in the binary :] 
[09:22] <pepeamid> yeah coz_
[09:22] <concept10> Phuzion, you may be using the radeon driver
[09:22] <parker`> Grant: setting grub as the bootloader on the MBR is pretty easy, just go into the grub command line from a terminal and type "setup (hd0)"
[09:22] <Phuzion> concept10:  if I am, I'm unaware
[09:22] <Zimka> Radeon drivers is sucks
[09:22] <fredl> wastrel, no kidding... really?
[09:22] <concept10> Phuzion, do a lsmod | grep r128
[09:22] <Grant> parker: how will it know what partition to boot into?
[09:22] <parker`> Grant: actually, just follow this http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-natively.html
[09:23] <concept10> Zimka, the latest one is pretty good
[09:23] <Phuzion> concept10: nada
[09:23] <fredl> wastrel, that's sick!
[09:23] <parker`> Grant: you configure that in /boot/grub/grub.conf
[09:23] <fredl> :)
[09:23] <Zimka> yeah )
[09:23] <coz_> pepeamid, ok I am not sure what you need at this point.. what window managers did you try... what did you install.. and did you reboot to see if that helps/
[09:23] <wastrel> fredl:  honestly it's just a conjecture- have to look at the source to be sure, & i'm not interested in getting into all that :] 
[09:23] <parker`> Grant: you will need to add a section in grub.conf for each OS you want to be available for boot
[09:23] <concept10> Phuzion, try to grep ati and then radeon
[09:23] <fredl> wastrel, tnx, that's really the last place I would've checked. I'll check but I think you might be right.
[09:23] <stevek> Zimka - I hear you...  I went out and bought an nVidia card this week.
[09:24] <pepeamid> i try with metacity and emerald coz_
[09:24] <Grant> parker: is there any way to do this with the GUI installer on this live CD (without over writing my current system)
[09:24] <Zimka> )
[09:24] <Phuzion> radeon returns nothing
[09:24] <tcli> lol
[09:24] <stevek> if anybody wants to buy a Radeon 9500 I have one sitting next to me :)
[09:24] <Grant> parker: basically I just finished setting up this complicated syslinux live cd on hd thing and I need to tell grub to boot to sda3 lol
[09:24] <parker`> Grant: not sure, I've always used Gentoo and did it from command line, I've found this way to be very reliable, not sure about any GUI installers to do it
[09:24] <Phuzion> concept10:  please join #flood so I can show you what the other grep returns
[09:24] <tcli> /usr/local/bin is added to my path by spamassassin on my server O_o
[09:24] <tcli> that is a trip
[09:24] <Zimka> I want girl )
[09:25] <stevek> hmph.  PPEwnrly ir'a  PEO.
[09:25] <Zimka> Where is she )
[09:25] <coz_> pepeamid, ok did you reboot the system to see if that helps?
[09:25] <stevek> uh thats... apparently it's a Pro (9500 Pro)
[09:25] <tcli> heh

=== Zimka is now known as Zim_I_Live_In_Ru

[09:26] <pepeamid> yes, coz_ i reboot twice
[09:26] <Zim_I_Live_In_Ru> heh
[09:26] <Zim_I_Live_In_Ru> )
[09:26] <parker`> Grant: what are you on right now? a ubuntu install, windows, a live CD?
[09:26] <tcli> bedtime for me... later
[09:26] <pepeamid> but dont change my configuration of control coz_
[09:26] <Grant> xubuntu live CD
[09:26] <Grant> parker: xubuntu live cd
[09:26] <Jordan_U> Anybody know what port nibbles uses?
[09:26] <Zim_I_Live_In_Ru> People you now Russian?
[09:26] <parker`> Grant: okay, so have you already installed xubuntu to your hard drive?

[09:27] <Grant> parker: yes
[09:27] <pepeamid> coz_, and i dont know what to do :(
[09:27] <stevek> anybody have any ftp client recommendations?  I can't use rsync and Filezilla has been frustrating (I want something where I can define a site and it will upload to the appropriate directories...  ie local:/home/me/webs/js maps to remote:/js)
[09:27] <parker`> Grant: are you trying to dual boot with other operating systems or just xubuntu?
[09:27] <mborohov> Zim_I_Live_In_Ru: also, you can pm me. ya govoruy po russki tozhi
[09:27] <Grant> parker: this is on an external hard drive that I only turn on when I want to boot to linux so yes just xubuntu
[09:27] <Zim_I_Live_In_Ru> gg
[09:28] <Zim_I_Live_In_Ru> bivaet )
[09:28] <coz_> pepeamid, ok I am not sure what is happening with your system, maybe someone who has been following this conversation can help
[09:28] <coz_> be back shortly
[09:28] <parker`> Grant: but the computer normally runs a different OS I take it
[09:28] <Grant> parker: Yes Vista
[09:28] <Grant> parker: due to boot order though that doesn't matter im not messign with the MBR of the HD that vista resides on
[09:28] <pepeamid> ok thanks anyway
[09:29] <sherl0ck> for XFCE desktop, is there a way to bind shortcut keys???
[09:29] <parker`> Grant: the thing about GRUB is that it's a bootloader, which means that if you install grub onto the MBR, you need to include an option to boot Vista (which you will make your default) and a separate option to boot xubuntu, otherwise you'd have to set your BIOS to boot the external HDD every time you wanted to use xubunutu
[09:29] <pepeamid> coz_, where i can downlaod controls themes for emerald, im search in google but dont find them
[09:29] <Vich> I just installed windows xp and ubuntu for a dual boot configuration
[09:29] <Vich> and I can't boot into windows
[09:29] <pepeamid> any page ? coz_
[09:29] <Vich> I installed winxp first
[09:30] <Vich> but I think it threw the ntldr and boot stuff on the drive I then installed ubuntu to
[09:30] <Vich> I'm hoping I can edit my /boot/grub/menu.lst to get it to boot windows by default
[09:30] <turbopc> I still have the same problem with playing DVDs - I followed all instructions to install libdvdcss and MediaPlayer/Totem still gives me an error asking if im trying to watch encrypted DVD without libdvdcss - any clues?
[09:30] <Grant> parker: I know that, but see if I only turn on the external HD that xubuntu is on when I want to boot to it, all other situations the computer will not see there is a USB HDD plugged in and will boot to vista. no problemo, I know this works and its fine. I just need to install grub on this external HD and have it boot to sda3 on the drive
[09:30] <stevek> pepeamid - if you are using beryl, there should be a bunch of themes already loaded - if not, try doing a make && make install in the emerald-themes directory
[09:31] <stevek> I haven't found anywhere to download other ones.
[09:32] <parker`> Grant: okay, so basically your boot order in BIOS is 1) external HDD 2) normal HDD? so when the external is off, it'll auto-boot the internal?
[09:32] <Grant> parker: exactly
[09:32] <pepeamid> yeah, the defaults themes works , but dont change the controls like
[09:33] <parker`> Grant: okay, you're in good shape then, what's the internal HDD showing up as on your system? hda or sdb?
[09:33] <pepeamid> my question its, how changes the f***ing controls theme xD
[09:34] <Grant> parker: well I just unplugged it and rebooted to do a test, want me to restart with it plugged in? (In this case it usually shows as sda and the external is sdb)
[09:34] <stevek> you know - there's a bunch of emerald themes at kde-look.org
[09:34] <stevek> I just poked over there and found some.
[09:34] <concept10> Phuzion, im going to try and install it
[09:35] <Phuzion> have fun, it's a great program to mess around with
[09:35] <pepeamid> thanks stevek
[09:35] <wastrel> g'nite
[09:36] <parker`> Grant: I just want to make sure you have the name right so you don't overwrite the MBR on the internal :) so from here I'd do a command-line setup of grub on the external, if you'd like me to help you with this PM me
[09:36] <pepeamid> stevek, i tired to try ... its all for me tonight .. maybe tomorrow keep trying
[09:36] <Simian__> why does my /etc/hosts have nothing in it any more?
[09:37] <pepeamid> see u coz_  and  stevek  thanks for all
[09:37] <Plecebo> does anyone know of a script to strip "illegal" characters from file names
[09:38] <Plecebo> or a utility to find and replace char's in file names
[09:38] <turbopc> Why is nobody responding to my question about DVD - it's such a simple task that makes me just more frustrated about how unifinished Ubuntu is....

[09:40] <stevek> turbopc: ahh - I ran into the same thing two days ago... lemme think
[09:41] <stevek> oh yeah...  you need to install totem-xine instead of totem using synaptic
[09:41] <stevek> but...
[09:41] <turbopc> stevek: and i still dont get why wouldnt ubuntu support dvd by default... as much as Windoze sux in stability i start realizing that its awesome when it comes to plug an play or compatibility in general!
[09:41] <stevek> turbopc: what I discovered is...  that totem does not support dvd menus, so I installed gxine which seemed to work better anyways.
[09:42] <bobbie__4> I going to bed so keep it down in here.
[09:42] <stevek> turbopc: the only downside is that if you aren't in full screen, it shows the movie title and timestamp below the video.

[09:46] <stevek> turbopc: sorry - I'm no expert.  You apparently already have all the knowledge I managed to collect so far.  One problem I ran into was that you can't install with apt-get with synaptics open.  Make sure synaptics is closed before running apt-get to install decss
[09:46] <stevek> turbopc: that's all I got :) sorry.
[09:46] <Ulixes> can anyone tell me what are the chmod default settings for /home/user??
[09:46] <Ulixes> (numbers pls )
[09:47] <ciplogic> Hi, when I've start X server it said (after an update) : missing font "fixed" at the start of X server, what package do I miss?
[09:47] <turbopc> thanks stevek
[09:47] <rokko> excuse me: how can i stop a printing job in terminal?
[09:47] <Dheeraj_k> dude Microsoft doesn't offer windows for free! and microsoft has agreement with vender of those codecs
[09:47] <boink> do a ps aux|less to see what number the printing job is then kill -9 <number>
[09:48] <Ulixes> can you help mee??
[09:48] <turbopc> boink: mplayer: failed to open dvd://1
[09:48] <boink> works for me
[09:48] <Dheeraj_k> so indirectly u pay for those codecs
[09:48] <stevek> rokko: ps -ef  to find the process, then kill 1234 where 1234 is the PID of the print process
[09:49] <newbuntu> hello all
[09:49] <warkruid> turbopc: mplayer doesn't see your dvd..  check /dev/ directory if there is a dvd entry and if it points to the correct device
[09:49] <DARKGuy> Greetings, anybody knows how to remove the nVIDIA official drivers safely for installing an older version?
[09:49] <stevek> rokko: if kill doesn't kill it, try kill -9, or sudo kill -9
[09:49] <newbuntu> im having troubles getting tv-out on my ati radeon 9550 card
[09:49] <boink> or get the right version of mplayer instead of the crippled version
[09:50] <newbuntu> anyone here use ati and have tv-out working?
[09:50] <turbopc> Dheeraj_k: well... but lets say with other codecs... i am talking about the ease of using it - u download one .exe, click, click - done... where in linux u need to edit 3092 files then run this run that open this, reboot, update, download modules, pakcages, another 30 minutes... done - u know what im trying to say?
[09:50] <boink> turbopc: wrong. I had it up and running in five minutes with apt-get
[09:50] <stevek> turbopc: d'oh, that was the other problem I had... I had to change the setting to which drive had the dvd (but I think that was mplayer, not gxine or totem-xine)
[09:50] <Dheeraj_k> @turbopc: wait for 1 minute i am pasting complete solution  in paste  bin
[09:50] <boink> that's faster than windows
[09:51] <boink> ubuntu is a bit of pain due to the codec restrictions it puts on itself
[09:51] <Kevin`> turbopc you don't sound like the type of person who 'gets' linux
[09:51] <boink> other distro's/OS's don't have these hassles.
[09:51] <turbopc> boink: dont get me wrong... i am both hands pro ubuntu and i hate windoze... its just so many more ppl would share my opinion if only ubuntu was a bit easier for noobs like me ;)
[09:51] <stevek> turbopc: I also went and downloaded the windows codecs, although I don't know if that made a difference.
[09:51] <boink> or who doesn't want to get linux
[09:52] <tonyyarusso> boink: That's the only way for it to not cost money
[09:52] <newbuntu> someone on bsd?
[09:52] <DARKGuy> Again - :P anybody knows how to remove the nVIDIA official drivers safely for installing an older version?
[09:52] <DARKGuy> turbopc: Ubuntu is the easiest Linux I've tried, personally :/
[09:52] <boink> sure, but this isn't a bsd channel :)
[09:52] <turbopc> Kevin`: I do get linux and thats i am still here trying to find a solution (for the past 2h) while having an XP box 30cm away ;)
[09:52] <newbuntu> he said who wouldnt want linux
[09:52] <Kevin`> turbopc a solution to what?
[09:53] <stevek> anybody have any gui ftp client recommendations?
[09:53] <turbopc> Kevin`: to my problem with playing DVDs
[09:53] <fyrestrtr> stevek: nautilus
[09:53] <DARKGuy> stevek: if you use GNOME... GFTP is a good one
[09:53] <Kevin`> turbopc I could give you my solution, but you won't like it
[09:53] <turbopc> stevek: gFTP is ok
[09:53] <newbuntu> boink you have tv-out working ever on ubuntu?
[09:53] <Kevin`> (there's probably an easier way)
[09:53] <Vich> hmm I can't mount an ntfs drive
[09:53] <boink> yes, but on Slackware
[09:53] <turbopc> hehe... Kevin`: id be more that happy to hear it anyways :P
[09:53] <warkruid> boink: slackware fan?
[09:53] <Vich> I made a dir called win_c in /media
[09:53] <boink> the trickey thing with tv on linux is that it must be running as a module
[09:54] <boink> Slackware: no, I can't stand it
[09:54] <Vich> and mount says /meia/win_c is not a block device
[09:54] <Kevin`> download the libdvdcss source, install it. download the livdvdread source, install it. download mplayer, configure, build, and install it
[09:54] <rokko> stevek: the closer thing to printing is lpd, but killing that process only stops lpd, when restarting it keeps printing a file
[09:54] <boink> and you need to put the tuner in the module.
[09:54] <Vich> what does that mean?
[09:54] <boink> the documentation from bytesex.com is fairly good
[09:54] <newbuntu> boink do you have to use the composite out or can you use the yellow video out ? I ask because my tv doesnt have composite just video in
[09:54] <Dheeraj_k> turbopc: u can play almost any kind of dvd on linux all u need to do little bit google!
[09:55] <newbuntu> libdvdcss has got to be one of the most common questions
[09:55] <boink> hmm, I just used an old BTR 878 card. it had a video out
[09:55] <Kevin`> turbopc I probably shouldn't say this, but the above process can be simplified to "emerge mplayer" :)
[09:55] <boink> !codecx
[09:55] <turbopc> Dheeraj_k: I know... the problem i have is not wheter its possible or not... the problem i have is why totem doesnt see the libdvdcss install
[09:55] <boink> !codecs
[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about codecx - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:55] <stevek> rokko: I would think it would be lpr that you're looking for, but I don't know for sure.  Perhaps it's already been queued to the printer...
[09:55] <Ulixes> can anyone tell me what are the def chmod values for /home/myuser
[09:55] <boink> ubuntu is working on getting the codecs mess sorted
[09:55] <turbopc> Kevin`: hehe :]  thanks ;)
[09:55] <DARKGuy> Hm
[09:55] <Ulixes> pls i'm new in linux
[09:55] <DARKGuy> !nvidia uninstall
[09:55] <Kevin`> as i'm SURE ubuntu has an east package for dvd stuff somewhere
[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia uninstall - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:55] <DARKGuy> :(
[09:55] <boink> Ulixes: chmod 775
[09:55] <Kevin`> since so many people use it
[09:55] <Ulixes> ok thz
[09:56] <newbuntu> i wish there was a gui for atitvout
[09:56] <boink> and so many beginners have totaly agony with the codecs in ubuntu
[09:56] <turbopc> hmmm...
[09:56] <boink> while in debian, it's quite easy. just apt-get :)
[09:56] <Ulixes> and /home/myuser/.dmrc
[09:56] <Ulixes> ?
[09:56] <rokko> stevek: yes, but when i do lpd to see printer queue, it doesnt display anything
[09:56] <newbuntu> hers a dumb question should a north american tv be set ntsc for ati card or pal?
[09:56] <turbopc> Kevin`: the source of my frustration is the fact that on linux everything is in pieces... you know what i mean?
[09:56] <boink> ntsc
[09:56] <LaserLine> newbuntu: ntsc
[09:56] <newbuntu> okay thanks
[09:57] <Kevin`> turbopc yes I think I do, and I love it.
[09:57] <turbopc> Kevin`: simple install/config is like a puzze ;)
[09:57] <boink> ntsc = never the same colour twice :P
[09:57] <Dheeraj_k> turbopc: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34086/
[09:57] <Ulixes> boink: what about /home/myuser/.dmrc?
[09:57] <boink> Ulixes: i don't know what .dmrc is
[09:57] <FluxD> hello this might be a really stupid question but what is the way to add another gnome panel?
[09:57] <DARKGuy> FluxD: right-click the already-existing panel and choose New Panel :P
[09:57] <boink> if it needs chmod 600 or whatever ...
[09:57] <Ulixes> it's a file placed in /home/myuser
[09:57] <LaserLine> 3200 RAM will work with a 2700 mobo right it will just run at 2700?
[09:57] <Ulixes> okok thz
[09:57] <turbopc> Dheeraj_k: should I just copy and paste? or save it as solution and then just run it? :P
[09:58] <Ulixes> a lot
[09:58] <FluxD> lol thanks darkguy :)
[09:58] <Dheeraj_k> that was easy :D
[09:58] <DARKGuy> welcome FluxD :P
[09:58] <Kevin`> turbopc the 'pieces' allow things to be easily used together in new ways
[09:58] <Kevin`> turbopc see aalib for an excellent and mostly useless example
[09:59] <newbuntu> can an ati card with video out be hooked up with just the yellow rca video cord to the tv or does it have to ce the composite hookup? my Tv only has yellow rca in, but that doesnt seem to work with fglrx atitvout
[09:59] <turbopc> Kevin`: yeah... i like that idea... but you know... we are past the era where 512KB HDD was a biggy, so why not to include that staff right away?
[09:59] <Kevin`> turbopc do you know how big a full install of debian is?
[09:59] <Kevin`> with it's 16 cds or so
[09:59] <Kevin`> you DON'T want that
[10:00] <Kevin`> anyway, that's what package managers are for :)
[10:00] <turbopc> Kevin`: 16 CDs????
[10:00] <DARKGuy> turbopc: the problem with Linux is that it's made by a worldwide community and everyone has their own ways for managing their projects/modules/pieces while Windows is a commercial OS made by an entire unified team which have to share and work with the same project and using the same rules - however, I find Linux more powerful than Windows.
[10:01] <Kevin`> turbopc somewhere around that.  getting "all" of a linux distro by default is not a good idea
[10:01] <turbopc> DARKGuy: I absolutely agree... but then... the only way to get all that Linux has to offer is to become a developer! :P
[10:01] <newbuntu> linux is for people who want to be part of something thats growing , peer reviewed, free and open
[10:01] <DARKGuy> newbuntu: yup
[10:02] <Kevin`> linux is for people who want to USE their computer :)
[10:02] <newbuntu> crack-free linux
[10:02] <rokko> how can i stop a printing job in lpd?
[10:02] <DARKGuy> turbopc: Yup, but not so like that - a novice user can use Linux too (or well, Ubuntu) it's just ... different than just point-and-click :P
[10:02] <Kevin`> turbopc 14 cds, sorry
[10:02] <newbuntu> i'm off the crack, and soon to be off the wine as well  : )
[10:03] <turbopc> Kevin`: i agree... but since ubuntu is the "for pepole distro" I assume that you would agree that most common tasks should be available right away... or one-cick-away to beat the DRM or the encryption law enforcment's system
[10:03] <Kevin`> turbopc I agree
[10:03] <sycho> how do I add/run scripts in edgy like i could in dapper?
[10:03] <Kevin`> but there are legal issues apparently
[10:03] <sycho> with the right clicking?
[10:03] <DARKGuy> turbopc: Agreed, but there come laws and all that stupid legal stuff 
[10:03] <DARKGuy> turbopc: and Linux people don't actually... "hack" but search workarounds
[10:03] <newbuntu> .. by crack I meant crack codes on windblows of course
[10:04] <DARKGuy> turbopc: free ones :)
[10:04] <Kevin`> DARKGuy some linux people DO hack.. the ones who make the workarounds :)
[10:04] <DARKGuy> Kevin`: Okay xD the good ones :)
[10:04] <turbopc> DARKGuy: thats what im saying... dont hack... just beat the system :P
[10:04] <Rainarrow> Hi all
[10:05] <DARKGuy> turbopc: yes, there are, just gotta learn how to apply them... since Linux is still, let's say not very mature for the common user, there's always some build-from-source or using-a-random-command that might seem hard for the common user :P
[10:05] <Dheeraj_k> hacking is not about screwing other it is all about discovering something new
[10:05] <stevek> what is the deal with dvd anyways...  is it really illegal to watch dvd's in linux in the us?
[10:05] <sciortlu> Hi guys
[10:05] <DARKGuy> Anyhow, brb, gonna reinstall nvidia drivers
[10:05] <boink> no, it's not illegal
[10:06] <boink> but ubuntu doesn't want to get sued to death
[10:06] <boink> that's why the codec hassles
[10:06] <stevek> fair enough.  The MPAA is definitely a PITA.
[10:06] <Rainarrow> Hi everyone,I am experiencing a strange behavor when pinging my Windows box from Ubuntu
[10:06] <malt> Good night! gone to bed.............
[10:07] <boink> however, other linux distro's and other OS don't have these hassles
[10:07] <boink> in FreeBSD, it's quite easy to get mplayer with win32codec and libdvd up and running
[10:07] <Rainarrow> it's like this:
[10:07] <Rainarrow> $ ping 192.168.0.1
[10:07] <Rainarrow> PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
[10:07] <Rainarrow> From 192.168.0.111 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
[10:07] <boink> Rainarrow: you have a firewall on that windows box?
[10:07] <Kevin`> Rainarrow looks like it's failing on the arp level
[10:08] <Rainarrow> ~$ arp
[10:08] <boink> arp -a
[10:08] <Rainarrow> Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface192.168.0.1                      (incomplete)                              eth1
[10:08] <Rainarrow> 192.168.0.1              ether   00:50:DA:81:04:7E   C                     eth0
[10:08] <Rainarrow> $ arp -a
[10:08] <Rainarrow> ? (192.168.0.1) at <incomplete> on eth1
[10:08] <Rainarrow> ? (192.168.0.1) at 00:50:DA:81:04:7E [ether]  on eth0
[10:08] <Rainarrow> and this is correct
[10:08] <Kevin`> hm why is it on both
[10:08] <Kevin`> route -n
[10:09] <Rainarrow> both?
[10:09] <sciortlu> boink ... what' your default route ?
[10:09] <Rainarrow> oh, my eth1 is a wireless
[10:09] <Kevin`> both interfaces
[10:09] <Rainarrow> and it's off now
[10:09] <sciortlu> route print
[10:09] <boink> !pastebin
[10:09] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:09] <Kevin`> sciortlu wrong route :)
[10:09] <stevek> I'm out...  gotta get to work :)
[10:10] <runes> I downloaded 6.10 server  but there is no option to select LAMP as per instruction on https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/installing-from-cd.html
[10:10] <Rainarrow> After a restart this problem will gone
[10:10] <boink> so?
[10:10] <stevek> and watch crouching tiger hidden dragon :)  (you guys reminded me I have a dvd sitting on the desk)
[10:10] <boink> just download the stuff with apt-get
[10:10] <Rainarrow> but it come back occasionally
[10:10] <Kevin`> steve same here :D
[10:10] <Kevin`> watching some star trek episodes..
[10:11] <dmnd> which episode
[10:11] <Kevin`> erm i'm not sure
[10:11] <Rainarrow> it seems like some arp problems to me, too
[10:11] <Rainarrow> Hi Kevin`
[10:11] <Kevin`> something from voyager season 7
[10:11] <Kevin`> hi Rainarrow
[10:11] <runes> boink are you running server?
[10:12] <Kevin`> Rainarrow did you paste the routing table?
[10:12] <Rainarrow> Kernel IP routing table
[10:12] <Rainarrow> Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
[10:12] <Rainarrow> 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
[10:12] <Rainarrow> 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
[10:12] <Rainarrow> default         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
[10:12] <Rainarrow> this is the output of route
[10:12] <Kevin`> disable either eth0 or eth0
[10:12] <Kevin`> er
[10:12] <Kevin`> disable either eth0 or eth1
[10:12] <Kevin`> that is likely the problem
[10:13] <tewn> i would like to install edgy however my motherboard requires a 2.6.19 kernel and i dont know how to compile my own kernel and i will will soon be getting an intel duo cpu
[10:13] <DARKGuy> Now take a look at this... I was asking for help on how to uninstall the nVIDIA drivers because it broke almost any OpenGL app (including WINE)... so some googling taught me the parameter --uninstall. Then reinstalling an older driver did it. See... it's just a thing of a bit of research ^_^;
[10:13] <Rainarrow> Hi Kevin`, problem solved
[10:13] <Kevin`> :)
[10:13] <Rainarrow> after I ifdown eth1
[10:14] <Rainarrow> Actually, I am running dapper on a Thinkpad T40
[10:14] <Rainarrow> I didn't ifdown my eth1, instead I just turned off the wireless using Fn+F5
[10:14] <sciortlu> great :-))))
[10:14] <Rainarrow> seems this lead to the problem
[10:15] <tewn> can i install edgy with a 2.6.19 pre stable release kernel from apt-get ?
[10:15] <LaserLine> 3200 RAM will work on a 2700 mobo, but will just run at 2700 speed right?
[10:15] <Rainarrow> LaserLine, it should be right
[10:15] <LaserLine> thanks
[10:15] <Kevin`> tewn what's the problem with your mobo, would it partially work with an older kernel so you could upgrade later?
[10:16] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, could explain a little about that problem?
[10:16] <tewn> no it would not recognize the network interface card.  possibly the XGA X3000 integrated video either.
[10:16] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, why a turnoff wireless could make that happen
[10:16] <Kevin`> Rainarrow it was trying to reach your windows pc over eth1, which was still active
[10:16] <Kevin`> and of course, wasn't working, because fn+f5 made it not work somehow
[10:16] <Rainarrow> tewn, can't you get a PCI interface card temporarily?
[10:17] <Kevin`> (hardware switch?)
[10:17] <tewn> hopefully.  i'll try.
[10:17] <stevek> turbopc: one thing I forgot... I installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly as well to get dvd going
[10:17] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, I see, thank you
[10:17] <valehru> Is there an IPOD restore feature in linux?
[10:17] <stevek> apparently there's good, bad, and ugly and ugly was what I needed.
[10:17] <turbopc> stevek: i did that
[10:18] <Kevin`> Rainarrow for most of the oss wireless drivers, taking the interface down will disable the radio.. what driver are you using? (out of curiosity)
[10:18] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, it's not really a hardware switch, it seems to make the BIOS generates a interrupt
[10:18] <stevek> turbopc: and you have libxine-extracodecs I imagine as well?
[10:19] <turbopc> stevek: yup
[10:19] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, I am not quite sure of the driver I am using, for it works out of the box
[10:20] <Rainarrow> However, ipw2100 appears in the output of lsmod
[10:20] <stevek> and gxineplugin?
[10:20] <turbopc> stevek: yeah
[10:20] <turbopc> stevek: i have all that i need to run it... it just doesnt do it :P
[10:21] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, and for my case the wireless LED still flashes even after taking down eth1
[10:21] <stevek> oh well... thought it was worth a shot...
[10:21] <Kevin`> Rainarrow interesting
[10:21] <fdsd> hey guys, I want to setup BIND to allow me to redirect a domain, for example I want digg.com to forward to an ip of choice, how would I set this up?
[10:21] <turbopc> stevek: thanks :)
[10:21] <Jergenson997> I need to learn to understand what Ububtu is to work
=== BoggsBeer is now known as deags
[10:22] <DARKGuy> Jergenson997: What do you exactly mean? Oo
[10:22] <Rainarrow> fdsd, u meant u r trying something like what the HOSTS file does in Windows?
[10:22] <Jergenson997> Hi Dark Guy
[10:22] <DARKGuy> Hi Jergenson997
[10:22] <Jergenson997> Which one is better, Ubuntu or Gnome
[10:23] <vitor> How do I install KDM Theme Manager ?
[10:23] <DARKGuy> Jergenson997: Ubuntu is the OS, Gnome is just the Window Manager - you can say Gnome is part of Ubuntu
[10:23] <Rainarrow> Jergenson997, Ubuntu is a distro while Gnome is a Windows Manager
[10:23] <the_owl> hello, somebody know how can i enable the guification in Gaim beta5?
[10:23] <Jergenson997> Which one is better
[10:24] <DARKGuy> Jergenson997: They're the same thing, Ubuntu uses Gnome for displaying you the windows. Maybe you're trying to mean KDE or XFCE?
[10:24] <fdsd> Rainarrow, yeah setting up a host file works fine, but I need a dns server to serve 100 machines
[10:25] <Jergenson997> Thank for the understanding
[10:25] <runes> Help!  Where on the server 6.10 cd boot menu does it say LAMP?
[10:26] <DARKGuy> Jergenson997: Welcome :P well, -personally- I like XFCE because it's like a lightweight Gnome for older PCs. There are a lot though. KDE looks more like Windoze and it has a Win98-like "start menu". I guess it's a thing of tastes, you'll have to test both to see which one is better for you.
[10:27] <guest> hey gang, anyone here a member of the slashdot channel
[10:27] <barata> hallo, what is the BEST iTunes-like linux app?
[10:27] <Sikon> a
[10:28] <Sikon> has anyone had any luck with the Lacie LightScribe application on Edgy?
[10:28] <DARKGuy> barata: I have no iPod to try one, but I heard about a program named iLinux which can be installed through Automatix2
[10:28] <guest> I can't join the slashdot channel, apparently you need an invite from someone else in the channel
[10:28] <Sikon> it worked for me on Dapper, but not Edgy
[10:28] <guest> I guess I'm not cool enough for the slashdot folk
[10:28] <Jergenson997> I am opposed to open source licenses.  Is there a way to use an entirely proprietary version of Linux?
[10:29] <guest> haha
[10:29] <FluxD> guest maybe you should get a better name than guest :)
[10:29] <guest> That's like saying white is black Jergenson
[10:29] <guest> Yeah I know flux, I'm new to IRC, still learning the ropes
[10:29] <DARKGuy> Jergenson997: Hm, there's RedHat which is kind of commercial, then again all Linux is opensource
[10:29] <guest> I guess I need an account first
[10:29] <Sikon> Jergenson997> then why do you use Linux in the first place? switch to Windows
[10:30] <Rainarrow> Jergenson997, why don't consider something like AIX or Solaris?
[10:30] <FluxD> guest try /nick then name here
[10:30] <guest> There is no complete proprietary Linux, and why the hell would you want that
[10:30] <Rainarrow>  /nick guest
[10:30] <Kevin`> Jergenson997 no, that is not possible, but you can buy some expensive unix varients if you want
[10:30] <Rainarrow> ...
[10:30] <Jergenson997> I am in opposition to open source software because it is promoted by communists.  And so I want to clense linux of the red infuence
[10:30] <Rainarrow> ........
[10:30] <FluxD> ....
[10:30] <guest> I'm about to slahs ignore Jergenson

[10:31] <DARKGuy> Uh...
[10:31] <isdn-noob> any gnome-ppp experts around?
[10:31] <DARKGuy> WTF?
[10:31] <Rainarrow> Jergenson997, may I know that where are you from?
[10:31] <guest> Jergenson why the hell are you in here, you are definitely not educated about open source, and he's just trying to get attention
[10:31] <DARKGuy> I think googling "open source" would do it
[10:31] <guest> Just ignore him, if he wanted to educate himself about open source he would do it already, you'd have to be a complete idiot to say the things he's saying
[10:31] <FluxD> or eikipedia it :)
[10:31] <DARKGuy> Lol :p
[10:31] <Sikon> Kick that troll already

[10:32] <Kevin`> I doubt he's actually interested in any information, just a troll
[10:32] <FluxD> wikipedia*
[10:32] <guest> Yeah he got on my nerves already
[10:32] <isdn-noob> Evening all
[10:32] <Sikon> seriously, ranting about Linux being communism on a Linux channel isn't the wisest thing to do
[10:32] <DARKGuy> Evenin'
[10:32] <DARKGuy> Uh
[10:32] <DARKGuy> Maybe he's kamikaze
[10:32] <isdn-noob> Anybody here played with gnome-ppp much?
[10:32] <Jergenson997> It is the best place to spread the Word
[10:32] <guest> Does that happen a lt in here? it's my first day, that kinda crap drives me nuts

[10:33] <Kevin`> Jergenson997 and join the republican party, sig heil! ;p
[10:33] <DARKGuy> Lol Rainarrow
[10:33] <Kevin`> rms is probably a communist, heh :D
[10:34] <guest> Alright this is a support forum, you're at the wrong place jergenson, if you want to spread your ideas go to a political channel, this is not the place

[10:34] <barata> anybody uses amarok?
[10:34] <Rainarrow> Kevin`, he is actually three communists
[10:34] <Jergenson997> Is it possible to view porn in linux?
[10:34] <Kevin`> Jergenson997 yes, it is
[10:34] <guest> Can we kick him out seriously, he's just looking for trouble
[10:34] <VigoFuse> But when run in gNewSence is gives an Aseop
[10:34] <Rainarrow> Jergenson997, u will have to install a Internet protocol called PPP
[10:34] <barata> only monkey porn is playable in Linux
[10:35] <Rainarrow> Jergenson997, PPP = Porn Preview Protocol
[10:35] <Jergenson997> So monkey porn is open source?
[10:35] <Kevin`> linux is perfectly capable of using non-opensource content
[10:35] <Kevin`> wherever did you get that idea
[10:35] <FluxD> actually there is a FOSS vista .... http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=514575&st=0

[10:48] <runes> LaserLine, let me know..I went to the ubuntu site for the install manual...the htlm file says there is the option at boot time but I did not see one
[10:48] <Kevin`> AlbinoRhino i'd like to get one of those, but the service is a bit expensive
[10:48] <Kevin`> AlbinoRhino most appear as a serial device, which acts as a modem
[10:49] <AlbinoRhino> I have the service but cant get it to run in ubuntu
[10:49] <napslap> AlbinoRhino you mean umst cards
[10:49] <Rainarrow> AlbinoRhino, I guess it's just like installing a PCMCIA modem?
[10:49] <AlbinoRhino> It is a 3g card
[10:49] <AlbinoRhino> yeah it is pcmcia
[10:50] <napslap> From which provider
[10:50] <AlbinoRhino> Cingular
[10:50] <VigoFuse> runes: LAMP?
[10:50] <Kevin`> it's probably cardbus, not pcmcia
[10:50] <AlbinoRhino> it is a Sierra 850
=== peterisc_ is now known as cuu508
[10:50] <AlbinoRhino> it i pcmcia
[10:50] <DARKGuy> !lamp
[10:50] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[10:50] <DARKGuy> Oh yay
[10:50] <napslap> dont know that one I had one from t mobile didnt work
[10:50] <Kevin`> AlbinoRhino are you sure it's not cardbus? most pc cards made today aren't pcmcia

[10:51] <runes> LaserLine, ok figured it out...when you select the first option to install the server, it will install the base loading the drivers etc for hardware after the partitioning and format it will install base then gives two options 1) dns 2) lamp  (you can select both)
[10:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about AIXGL - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:52] <LaserLine> runes: oh thanks for the info
[10:52] <LaserLine> runes: good to know
[10:52] <Kevin`> AlbinoRhino that is a guide to getting your card working in linux, from the manufacturer apparently
[10:52] <runes> np LaserLine  I think I'll have to update some info on the server section
[10:53] <abes> where can i find a log of the boot-up? I saw some "could not find" type of errors flashing during startup but i didnt get what they say!?
[10:53] <VigoFuse> That package can be installed after the install of Ubuntu by useing the Synaptik Package Manager. I think
[10:53] <AlbinoRhino> I tried that Kevin` but I am unsure as to if I put the code in the right spot in /etc/pcmcia/config
[10:53] <napslap> go one a konsol and type dmesg this will tell you what is in your computer take out hte card type dmesg and than put the card back in Type dmesg again and you will know what jkind off card it is

[11:19] <emperorsquirrels> No, USB.
[11:19] <Kangoo> how to display it again ?
[11:19] <Kevin`> Oh
[11:19] <Kevin`> well ok then
[11:19] <emperorsquirrels> I bought a USB because apparently ralink drivers are easier to install =\
[11:20] <Kevin`> you got the usb driver though yes?
=== we2by_ is now known as we2by
=== afflux is now known as chaoflux
[11:20] <emperorsquirrels> I got the one from my Belkin disc, but it doesn't seem to work.
[11:20] <nal209> Kevin` any idea about my problem?
=== chaoflux is now known as afflux
[11:20] <presto> should i open it with the archive manager
[11:20] <emperorsquirrels> I also have that source-install you linked me to.
[11:20] <stork> how come if i have this line in /etc/fstab: `//192.168.0.3/Group /media/debsrv      smbfs   username=alex,password=XXXX,user,auto,rw,noexec 0 0` i can't log into ubuntu.. it says 'unable to initialize HAL!' when i try and log in, and the rest of gdm doesn't load... i can't log into ubuntu at all.. i need to comment it out of /etc/fstab and reboot. is the string malformed? it works if i do `sudo mount -a` and mount manually..
[11:20] <we2by> guys, does firefox has a feature to cache all my bookmarks?
[11:20] <we2by> the webpages itself
[11:20] <Kangoo> ok I have corrected my problem
[11:20] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels I probably linked you to the pci one if you didn't specify
[11:20] <emperorsquirrels> Oh.
[11:21] <Kevin`> yours was 257something? what again?
[11:21] <emperorsquirrels> I read that the ralink driver I need is 2570.

[11:23] <Rainarrow> Well, I see
[11:23] <Rainarrow> leafw, why don't you try to invoke cdrecord directly?

[11:23] <leafw> Rainarrow : well, ease of use!
[11:23] <usound> hi, does anybody know in what package I can find sdl-config. I am on Ubuntu, and am trying to complie an sdl program, but it can't find sdl-config. I have libsdl1.2debian installed though, so I'm not sure what to do.
[11:23] <leafw> I'm trying to find out where is the actual command taht gnome calls, so that I can add the option for multisession
[11:23] <AlbinoRhino> we2by : https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/14/
[11:23] <Kevin`> it seems your having 'ease of use' problems by not invoking it directly
[11:24] <Kevin`> I just open an xterm and use cdrecord
[11:24] <Kevin`> easy and fast
[11:24] <Rainarrow> leafw, I use k3b and fount it's nice
[11:24] <leafw> Kevin` : indeed, but maybe it can be fixed.
[11:24] <leafw> Rainarrow : I use k3b as well, just fiddling
[11:25] <leafw> Kevin` : cdrecord from an xterm, well, I do that when all files to record are in the same folder, otherwise ... no.

[11:33] <fulhack> Heya guys. I'm gettin a bit rusty.. How can I allow any user to read & write to a mounted device? (gmailfs) I figured setting "users" in fstab would do?

[11:39] <unfun> turbo, relax

[11:39] <v4m21> apt-get vlc  vlc-plugin-esd
[11:39] <emperorsquirrels> Kevin` Assuming that I have them installed, what would be the next step?
[11:40] <doms> yes i install b4 nvidia-glx my ubuntu edgy but when i restart the display manager no gui occur
[11:40] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels to type make
[11:40] <doms> yes i install b4 nvidia-glx my ubuntu edgy but when i restart the display manager no gui occur
[11:40] <b03nto> emperorsquirrels: u can see them at /usr/src i guess
[11:40] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels the error suggests you don't have them
[11:40] <turbopc> Jbirk: obviously... did you read my first sentence? I did everything that there is available online... so i would assume that libdvdcss was one of the steps somewhere there ;]  lol
[11:40] <Zaggynl> turbopc, hmm totem just plays this dvd fine
[11:40] <unfun> To read video files, Totem uses the Gstreamer framework. To play some video formats, you may need to add further codec suppor

[11:41] <Jbirk> Honestly, just go through that
[11:41] <turbopc> Zaggynl: the problem with totem is that it gives me the error saying: "Are you trying to play an encrypted DVD without libdvdcss?" or something similar... the only thing is that i have libdvdcss which i reinstalled/updated 12309 times!
[11:42] <Zaggynl> That
[11:42] <turbopc> Jbirk: for the 6th time? i think im fine....
[11:42] <sciortlu> bye guys ... have a nice day :-)
[11:42] <Zaggynl> 's odd :(

[11:42] <redmonkey> hi
[11:42] <Kevin`> does usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/include exist?
[11:43] <Seveas> Kevin`, not on ubuntu, ubuntu does not support 2.4 series kernels

[11:43] <Jbirk> You know what I bet it is
[11:43] <Jbirk> Region
[11:43] <Lukian> doms: what occurs instead of a gui?
[11:43] <Jbirk> Do you have your drive's region set?
[11:43] <turbopc> b03nto: but it plays just fine on another PC
[11:43] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels what kernel version are you using
[11:43] <Jbirk> Honestly, setup your drives region then install all the stuff on the restricted Formats page
[11:43] <Jbirk> and install vlc
[11:43] <Jbirk> then open VLC
[11:44] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels uname -r

[11:44] <Seveas> Amaranth, +t?
[11:44] <redmonkey> is there an easy way to install xgl/aiglx on edgy eft? and is there a way to install it without adding extra repositories?

[11:46] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels I wonder why it's trying to go to /usr/src/linux-2.6.18-3
[11:46] <Jbirk> The only thing I have to do that is unusual is select deinterlace>blend
[11:46] <Kevin`> emperorsquirrels is there a /usr/src/linux symlink?
[11:46] <Jbirk> and the picture looks better

[11:51] <Jbirk> Soundray, is it safe to delete them?
[11:51] <Kevin`> presto look in the readme included with the driver for the module name
[11:52] <presto> ok
[11:52] <Kevin`> it would have showed it when you installed it, but I doubt you were looking for it :)
[11:52] <desaparecido> Kevin`, firefox crashes
[11:52] <Jbirk> how do I clean them up?
[11:52] <Spee_Der> unfu1: To install it via terminel 'sudo apt-get install vlc'
[11:52] <soundray> Jbirk: 'sudo apt-get autoclean'
[11:52] <Jbirk> okay
[11:52] <turbopc> what does it normally mean that after running make all u get is a bunch of errors?
[11:52] <desaparecido> Kevin`, it is unstable, flash plugin doesn't work

[11:57] <LinuxHelp> How can I avoid this dmesg when umounting a cifs share: "CIFS VFS close with pending writes." I've tried the "sync" command but that doesnt work. I've tried sync and "mount -o remount,ro" and then only a umount (all with little sleep 15's in between) but still I get the dmesg.
[11:57] <Kevin`> you

[11:57] <desaparecido> soundray, TNX I'll try.
[11:57] <presto> ok so i put in terminal sudo modprobe rt2500usb
[11:57] <Kevin`> erm, it looks like the modules name is rt2570

[11:58] <Kevin`> sudo modprobe rt2570

[11:58] <nati> i have 2 hd 1 with xp and one with ubuntu
[11:58] <tommie> yeah indeed
[11:59] <nati> how can i do to use the xp one?
[11:59] <Kevin`> presto yes.
[11:59] <turbopc> i am trying to install region from here: http://linvdr.org/projects/regionset/ - i unpacked the tar.gz, and Im trying to run make... no success - any ideas?
[11:59] <soundray> nati: do you see a grub menu when you boot?
[11:59] <nati> yes soundray
[11:59] <DARKGuy> oh, hey soundray! just wanted to say thanks for the modeline stuff you helped me with yesterday :)
[11:59] <alecjw> is there a list of working network cards anywhere?
[11:59] <soundray> nati: that should normally have an entry for Win XP
[11:59] <nati> i can see xp hd but i cant use it
[11:59] <soundray> DARKGuy: did it work in the end?
[12:00] <presto> ok it asked for password i gave it and i guess it worked
[12:00] <DARKGuy> soundray: Yup! I had to tweak it a bit, but it worked forcing the 1024x768 mode in the xorg.conf directly ^^
[12:00] <Kevin`> presto and the device is connected, yes?
[12:00] <nati> I would like to use xp hard disk using ubuntu.......
[12:00] <nati> is it possible?
[12:00] <tommie> had to install bluez-passkey-gnome and iniate pairing from the k750i
[12:00] <Kevin`> just read data from it, or boot it, or what
[12:00] <presto> yes
[12:01] <Kevin`> presto iwconfig
[12:01] <soundray> DARKGuy: well done. I remember a time when you had to write a modeline everytime you wanted to use a CRT's full capability...
[12:01] <tommie> and gnome-bluetooth (not for syncing however, but for sending mp3)
[12:01] <soundray> nati: there are instructions for that on the wiki:
[12:01] <DARKGuy> soundray: Man o.o; that must have been hell x_x

[12:02] <soundray> DARKGuy: it was great fun, especially when your carefully crafted modeline worked in the end ;)
[12:02] <Kevin`> there's a way to force it to bind the device to that particular driver, but I forget how, and it shouldn't be needed usually
[12:02] <DARKGuy> soundray: Heh, just like now xD feels great :P
[12:02] <presto> wow alot of info
[12:02] <nati> thank for helping me

[12:03] <Kevin`> presto related information
[12:03] <nati> anyone is able to configure usb audio device on ubuntu?
[12:03] <asqueella> hi, I'm planning to reinstall windows, which will probably overwrite the boot loader. I'd like to restore it after the installation. I don't have a floppy drive, ubuntu installation CD, or blank CDs (only blank DVD discs). Any suggestions on how I can restore the boot loader later?
[12:03] <tommie> bye bye windows!
[12:03] <soundray> nati: most usb audio cards work "out of the box"
[12:04] <Kevin`> asqueella it's probably possible to write it from windows, using some windows version of the dd program
[12:04] <presto> im lost?
[12:04] <Kevin`> only write the first 446 bytes of the hard drive
[12:04] <Kevin`> which you backed up from before you installed windows
[12:04] <asqueella> oh, nice idea
[12:04] <soundray> presto: if you get any output from 'lsmod | grep rt2500usb' then it will have loaded the module all right.
[12:04] <Kevin`> someone tell presto how to bind a usb device to a particular driver
[12:04] <dmnd> what can i best use to playback dvd's?
[12:04] <lostinc> can anyone tell me how to get the desktop bar at the bottom of this screen shot? http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=45987
[12:05] <Kevin`> or grep rt2570
[12:05] <nati> in fact mine don't function. is there any driver
[12:05] <nati> ?
[12:05] <presto> i did the dmesg and it gave me a ton of info
[12:05] <nati> mine are pcphoneline
[12:05] <asqueella> Kevin`: thanks, I'll try that
[12:05] <soundray> nati: have you chosen the device via System-Preferences-Sound?
[12:05] <presto> want me to type "grep rt2570"
[12:06] <Kevin`> presto do what soundray said, only do it with both that and rt2570 (do it twice, try both)
[12:06] <soundray> presto: yes, whatever the name of the module was in the end
[12:06] <nati> where is soundray?
[12:06] <soundray> nati: third menu from the top left

[12:09] <Kevin`> like not applicable to usb

[12:33] <apokryphos> ubotu: tab | we2by
[12:33] <ubotu> we2by: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[12:33] <apokryphos> =)
[12:33] <ubd> whats the difference btw su and gksu?
[12:33] <we2by> I did
[12:33] <we2by> apokryphos
[12:33] <Spee_Der> !kstars
[12:33] <ubotu> kstars: desktop planetarium for KDE. In component main, is optional. Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 4133 kB, installed size 7632 kB
[12:34] <apokryphos> ubd: su is to switch to root user, which is disabled in Ubuntu by default. gksu/gksudo is made for starting graphical applications with the root user, in a safer environment.
[12:34] <we2by> now I wish totem can play real media files too. hehe
[12:34] <apokryphos> ubd: unfortunately it seems like gedit doesn't work with gksu, so you'll have to use sudo gedit as Seveas said
[12:35] <ubd> can i always use sudo instead of gksudo?
[12:35] <apokryphos> we2by: instructions for playing realmedia on the FAQ. Won't work with totem though.
[12:35] <apokryphos> ubd: it's good practice to always use gksudo instead of sudo for GUI apps. But in gedit's case it seems that isn't possible.
[12:36] <zdenek> join #ubuntu
[12:36] <ubd> but gedit runs after the error :D
[12:36] <apokryphos> zdenek: you're here already 8)
[12:36] <apokryphos> ubd: yup
[12:36] <ubd> so why theres an error
[12:37] <apokryphos> ubd: because there's a bug
[12:37] <Storkme> how come if i use a command to mount a samba fs it works fine but if i put it in /etc/fstab it gives me an error when i log in to X... the error is 'unable to initialize HAL!' (using ubuntu) and i need to comment out the line in /etc/fstab and reboot in order to log in... the line in /etc/fstab is as follows: //192.168.0.3/Group /media/debsrv      smbfs   username=alex,password=XXXXXX,user,auto 0 0

[12:39] <Begasus> f*ck
[12:39] <apokryphos> ubotu: language
[12:39] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:39] <Begasus> how do I install ubuntu with grub on /
=== asqueella__ is now known as asqueella
[12:39] <Begasus> that's why I used * apokryphos :)
[12:39] <we2by> I wish there is a app to install faster than typing in terminal
[12:39] <Begasus> but I'll keep it in mind
[12:39] <apokryphos> Begasus: it really doesn't make a difference :P
[12:39] <apokryphos> Begasus: specify "/" as the mount point in the installer
[12:40] <we2by> maybe a small app where you enter the name of the software you want and it asks for the password and install
[12:40] <Begasus> trying to install Edgy
[12:40] <we2by> synaptic is a bit slow
[12:40] <Begasus> but it doesn't let me sellect / apokryphos
[12:40] <apokryphos> why?
[12:40] <apokryphos> Begasus: have you selected it to be formatted?
[12:40] <Begasus> and when I type / in the installer it sets it to /dev//
[12:40] <Set> I accidently deleted a folder that I need... does anyone know if there is possible to get it back?
[12:41] <we2by> Set, how did you delete it?
[12:41] <Begasus> try'd to set it to 'hda6' (the volume / is on)
[12:41] <Set> we2by, a buggy file manager deleted everything in the folder, instead of just the file I selected
[12:42] <Begasus> and after it was installed rebooted and then I end up in bash :S
[12:42] <we2by> Set, try ~/.Trash
[12:42] <apokryphos> Begasus: have you selected it to be formatted?
[12:42] <Begasus> it  does that automaticly apokryphos
[12:42] <Begasus> so yes
[12:42] <Begasus> did a manual partition
[12:42] <apokryphos> hm
[12:42] <ubd> whats the difference btw trickle and trickled?
[12:42] <rysiek|pl> hi all
[12:42] <Begasus> as I con't wat to loose the other partitions
[12:43] <apokryphos> ubd: trickled is the daemon, presumably
[12:43] <Set> it's empty
[12:43] <we2by> Set, they are probably gone
[12:43] <apokryphos> Begasus: hm, I'm not sure then. Can't tell from here.
[12:43] <ubd> apokryphos: being daemon means that?
[12:43] <Set> .. :(
[12:43] <rysiek|pl> guys, I need to change the framebuffer's resolution WITHOUT rebooting. I seem to remembger there was some command for it, but I cannot recall it's name
[12:43] <we2by> but you still can recover files if it is a ext3 filesystem
[12:43] <apokryphos> ubd: to always run, in the background.
[12:44] <Limulf> Is there any way to make the nice dvd burner built in Nautilus to show you the size of your current compilation vs free space in target media? (a two coloured bar, for example). Thanks for your time and work.
[12:44] <Set> it's ReiserFS
[12:44] <Spee_Der> rysiek|pl: You mean the screen resolution ?
[12:44] <rollfilm> is devilspie's geometry function having issues on edgy? it's not doing anything
[12:44] <ubd> apokryphos: when i start mlnet with trickle, it gives error. when i run "trickled -parameter mlnet" it looks ok. but is it really working?
[12:44] <apokryphos> Begasus: only thing I can recommend atm is trying the alternate CD
[12:45] <we2by> set, just google how you can recover your files ;)
[12:45] <apokryphos> ubd: never used it I'm afraid
[12:45] <Begasus> hmm I have an original CD here ...
[12:45] <Begasus> makes that usless then :S
[12:45] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: I mean: the XServer works AOK. the console terminals (TTY1 through 6) have some resolution set that the monitor dislikes
[12:45] <we2by> Set, http://forums.infoprosjoint.net/showthread.php?t=5821
[12:46] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: I know I can solve it by rebooting with a proper vga= in grub, but I don't want to reboot
[12:46] <zlack> hey guys, how can i upgrade to edgy but leave my X the same?
[12:47] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: and I am *sure* there was a way to change the fb's resolution without rebooting
[12:47] <Spee_Der> rysiek|pl: I'd make a backup of you /etc/X11/xorg.conf file 1st. The in a terminal sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see what needs changing........  Then......
[12:47] <apokryphos> zlack: you can't
[12:47] <keisha> #jakarta
[12:47] <zlack> apokryphos: why not? :)
[12:47] <Spee_Der> rysiek|pl: Then you can use ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X without rebooting the computer.....
[12:48] <apokryphos> zlack: because a lot of other packages will be depending on the new Xorg version
[12:48] <zlack> apokryphos: ah ok - that makes sense
[12:48] <ubd> apokryphos: cant he upgrade to ubuntu-server?
[12:48] <apokryphos> zlack: why don't you want to upgrade to 7.2?
[12:48] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: uhm.. where you actually reading what I was saying?
[12:48] <zlack> apokryphos: aiglx made my xgl very slow
[12:48] <apokryphos> ubd: ubuntu-server isn't contained on the desktop CD
[12:48] <apokryphos> zlack: you can disable aiglx I believe
[12:49] <apokryphos> zlack: try in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:49] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: I'll repeat: XServer's working AOK. period. it has nothing to do with the XServer.
[12:49] <zlack> apokryphos: tried a lot, but i want to keep my fancy xgl effect which safe me a lot of work.
[12:49] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: I need to change the text-mode framebuffer console resolution.
[12:49] <keisha> #jakarta
[12:50] <zlack> apokryphos: how can i upgrade my kernel to the latest version then on ubuntu? is there a package for it, or do i need to add a dep in my sources.lst ?
[12:50] <Spee_Der> keisha: Try this /j #jakarta
[12:50] <apokryphos> zlack: search the beryl forum for how to disable aiglx, I'm pretty sure you can do it.
[12:50] <zlack> apokryphos: ok, will try that

[12:51] <amileft> How to know My OS is Ubuntu by a sh commond
[12:51] <apokryphos> amileft: no repeating please. Type cat /etc/issue
[12:51] <gordonjcp> how can I remove totem, without it wanting to remove ubuntu-desktop?
[12:51] <apokryphos> amileft: stop
[12:51] <zlack> apokryphos: really? :(
[12:51] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: no easy way. But read the FAQ on metapackages
[12:51] <apokryphos> zlack: yup
[12:51] <amileft> sorray
[12:51] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: is it possible to entirely disable it?
[12:51] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: disable? Do you mean remove?
[12:52] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: possibly remove, but in general stop it getting in the way
[12:52] <zlack> apokryphos: thans - i'll look into disabling aiglx then. cheers!
[12:52] <keisha> heuhu
[12:52] <gordonjcp> as in, I never ever want totem to try and play anything, unless I specifically run it
[12:52] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: check the FAQ :)
[12:52] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: it goes over just this problem
[12:53] <amileft> How can i know my OS is Ubuntu by command Please.I wait....1m
[12:53] <Spee_Der> rysiek|pl: I don't know that you can change it without restarting it, as it starts when the system starts, unlike xorg.conf settings....
[12:53] <apokryphos> amileft: I told you. Type 'cat /etc/issue'
[12:54] <rysiek|pl> Spee_Der: m'kay, thanks anyway :)
[12:54] <Spee_Der> rysiek|pl: That's how I'm reading it anyway, sorry.
[12:54] <Storkme> how come if i use a command to mount a samba fs it works fine but if i put it in /etc/fstab it gives me an error when i log in to X... the error is 'unable to initialize HAL!' (using ubuntu) and i need to comment out the line in /etc/fstab and reboot in order to log in... the line in /etc/fstab is as follows: //192.168.0.3/Group /media/debsrv      smbfs   username=alex,password=XXXXXX,user,auto 0 0
[12:54] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: right, I've read the faq, it says that removing ubuntu-desktop breaks subsequent updates
[12:54] <amileft> apokryphos, Thank you I leave now! bye
[12:54] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: if you don't have it installed when you update...
[12:55] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: so (i) it's fine to remove it, BUT if you do (ii) reinstall it just before you upgrade
[12:55] <gordonjcp> hm
[12:56] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: doesn't wokr
[12:56] <gordonjcp> reinstalling ubuntu-desktop reinstalls totem-too
[12:56] <gordonjcp> s/totem-too/totem, too/
[12:56] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: yes....... only reinstall ubuntu-desktop when you want to *upgrade*
[12:57] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: but then I need to remove totem again
[12:58] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: another solution would be working out some way to get totem to play media
[12:58] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: look, it works like this :). You remove totem now, which removes ubuntu-desktop. 6 months later, when you *need* to upgrade, you reinstall ubuntu-desktop, which brings totem in
[12:58] <apokryphos> after you've upgraded, you remove totem again. 6 months later....
[12:58] <Storkme> how come if i use a command to mount a samba fs it works fine but if i put it in /etc/fstab it gives me an error when i log in to X... the error is 'unable to initialize HAL!' (using ubuntu) and i need to comment out the line in /etc/fstab and reboot in order to log in... the line in /etc/fstab is as follows: //192.168.0.3/Group /media/debsrv      smbfs   username=alex,password=XXXXXX,user,auto 0 0
[12:58] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: uhm, that's too complicated
[12:58] <specialagent> Hallo zusammen! Ich habe folgendes Problem bei welchen ich ein wenig Hilfe bentige! Ich bin von meiner Windowsmaschine auf mein neues Lappi mit ubuntu umgestiegen. Unter Win bin ich eigentlich ein versierter Nutzer aber unter Ubuntu ne hilflose Person! Ich bekomme nmlich nach zig Versuchen enfach nicht mein Wlan mit WPA ans laufen trotz tutorials und workarouds, noch mit faq, wre nett wenn mich mal einer von euch an die Hand nehmen kn
[12:58] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: erm, why exactly? It involves doing one command.
[12:58] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: I need to talk someone fairly clueless through this every time they need to upgrade
[12:58] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: so once every six months you have to tell them to do one command?
[12:59] <apokryphos> seems fair enough to me
[12:59] <apokryphos> specialagent: English only in here please
[12:59] <apokryphos> is that German?
[12:59] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: if totem either a) played any media, or b) would tell me what formats it supported then it might work

[01:00] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: regarding multimedia codecs
[01:00] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: it's in the channel topic
[01:00] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: ah, that
[01:00] <apokryphos> or here:
[01:00] <apokryphos> ubotu: faq

[01:01] <Dzamir_> lol gianluca let's speak english :)
[01:01] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: if you followed the page the FAQ links to then they'd work
[01:01] <gianluca> Ddamir conosci il canale italiano di ubuntu?
[01:01] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: better yet, it hijacks links to media in firefox in a really irritating way

[01:01] <gianluca> #ubuntu-it
[01:02] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: there is exactly one reference to codecs on the page you just gave the link to, and it refers to AMD64 processors
[01:02] <gianluca> tks ubotu

[01:02] <apokryphos> gianluca: no space before "/join"
[01:02] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: hang on a sec, "restricted formats"?
[01:02] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: yes
[01:03] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: since when is MJPEG a restricted format?
[01:03] <gianluca> tks
[01:03] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: who said it was?
[01:03] <gianluca> tks apok
[01:03] <apokryphos> np
[01:03] <gianluca> i'm in italian chat
[01:03] <apokryphos> =)
[01:03] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: well, totem doesn't support MJPEG, and from what you've said I need to install "restricted packages"
[01:03] <Dzamir_> lol
[01:04] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: well, I'm pretty sure it should
[01:04] <apokryphos> only thing I can recommend (as I did before), since I never use gstreamer, is installing the xine plugin for totem
[01:04] <gordonjcp> it definitely doesn't
[01:04] <apokryphos> install totem-xine and libxine-extracodecs
[01:04] <RamseS> czech????
[01:04] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: but I don't want totem at all
[01:04] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: totem breaks firefox

[01:05] <arepie> http://h3lp.madpage.com/Ubuntu/refer.txt <-- i post my question here.. please anyone..
[01:05] <gordonjcp> uninstalling that wants to remove totem, which wants to remove ubuntu-desktop
[01:05] <apokryphos> gordonjcp: but totem should work. Try using the xine engine instead
[01:06] <gordonjcp> apokryphos: I don't want totem
[01:06] <apokryphos> then remove it
[01:06] <gordonjcp> it's horrible
[01:06] <gordonjcp> hang on
[01:06] <apokryphos> I don't like totem too =)
[01:06] <gordonjcp> removing the symlinks to the plugin libs seems to have stopped it messing with firefox
[01:06] <apokryphos> I've very surprised removing that wants to remove totem though; that's insane.
[01:07] <Begasus> how are the disks in ubuntu?
[01:07] <apokryphos> strong
[01:07] <Begasus> something like /dev/disk/ide/hda* ?
[01:07] <apokryphos> Begasus: /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb2 etc
[01:07] <Begasus> ah k ..
[01:07] <apokryphos> this is explained in the FAQ too :P
[01:07] <Begasus> so I'll try to do /dev/hda5 now then

[01:27] <ps|cho> Hello folks, I am using ubuntu on Vmware. I want to test whether if I can use fglrx/composite eye-candy on this installation. The physical graphics card is an ATI radeon card. But Ubuntu recognizes a generic card and uses that other driver- mesa. So I want to know whether if its safe to try the composite/fglrx drivers
[01:29] <ps|cho> or rather, whether fglrx/composites would work on the generic card.
[01:29] <arepie> ps|cho, i have the same problem
[01:29] <arepie> look at this.. is it the same problem? --> http://h3lp.madpage.com/Ubuntu/refer.txt
[01:29] <ps|cho> let me.
[01:32] <ps|cho> I don't think its the same. X is reporting "BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)" - its something to do with VM ware...I think i'll have to first see whether there's an option to let VM have access directly to the graphics card- not too familiar in this department

[02:16] <admin123> Delano, kde configure also it's fonts and adjusts them also for gtk. So you have to disable some configurations in kde.
[02:16] <gunfus> Celldweller: yes I did reboot
[02:16] <tuxtux> reboot

[02:17] <kane77> i ran 'sudo sane-find-scanner' and it found my scanner.. great.. what do I do next? (xsane still says no scanner found...)
[02:17] <gunfus> Celldweller: So it seems that is a problem in the auto-detect.. After I select the STAC92xxx Analog (I guess that is my driver) things work
[02:17] <gunfus> hmm
[02:17] <Celldweller> click the down arrow where it says auto detect
[02:17] <Celldweller> find your card

[02:17] <Celldweller> and close it
[02:17] <Celldweller> reboot

[02:32] <fnf> Ubuntu seemed to be doing something obscure under the hood that I couldn't manage to get it running with my new kernel.
[02:32] <TurtleBoots> eugman: no I haven't I'm very new to all this. Can you advise of a good fourm please?
[02:32] <w1ndow> where does ubuntu store downloaded packages?
[02:33] <codecaine> /usr/sbin or /usr/bin

[02:35] <finalbeta> I have an MD8080 (medion PC with the 5.1 speaker set that came with it). To run ubuntu on it with sound from tv card and 5.1 sound control, I needed to write a script, some tips are useful and needed to switch two cabled for the speakers. i've reported bugs, but let's be real, they will never get fixed. Is it acceptable to create a page on the wiki where I post the script/give a few tips to other users with the same model?

[02:41] <finalbeta> Ah, thnx tonyyarusso
[02:41] <wceoscar> felix, that will install kubuntu.. i dont want kubuntu... i just want to be able to use both enviroments... gnome as my defalt and KDE as an ption when i start up
[02:42] <_felix> you can still start Gnome as default
[02:42] <wceoscar> Or will this command install only KDE sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop?
[02:42] <Guerrand> wceoscar ... kubuntu is the entire system ... kubuntu-desktop is just the kde environment for ubuntu
[02:42] <_felix> However, I don't know how kde stuff will integrate with gnome, since I never used gnome again, since installing kde
[02:43] <_felix> kubuntu is the same "entire" system except the desktop environment
[02:43] <_felix> so nothing beyond that is installed
[02:43] <wceoscar> Guerrand... Will the ubuntu logo display and will i  be able to use Gnome too?
[02:43] <whyme> :( youe not even there....
[02:44] <Guerrand> wceoscar ... no idea soz .. only know it cause im currently installin the gnome desktop on another machine
[02:44] <efrerich> After updating ubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 I get "cyrus/notify[6367] : incorrect version of Berkeley db: compiled against 4.3.29, linked against 4.4.20" What should I do?
[02:44] <wceoscar> will i be able to remove that enviroment if i want to?
[02:45] <whyme> ARGH!
[02:45] <rada> hello
[02:45] <Guerrand> you should be able too ... but i seriously doubt the system will be happy about it
[02:45] <_felix> I think so. Didn't to it yet
[02:45] <rada> i want to install MAC OSX on my intelbased Laptop
[02:45] <rada> is this the right channel?
[02:45] <_felix> @rada: no
[02:45] <rada> see this: http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/499238/?show_files=&page=2#comments
[02:46] <Guerrand> lol ... rada ... prolly not considering its called #ubuntu
[02:46] <wceoscar> ill keep Gnome then... The only feature i want to have is getting windows transparency on Gnome.... how can this be done?
[02:46] <elias>  I have installed beryl and the kernel with the latest nvidia drivers. Now every time I reboot vmware is telling me to run the config script again.
[02:46] <rada> i tried OSX, but i needed to be intentified
[02:46] <rada> i mean the channel OSX
[02:47] <Wooot> rada: What did you try #osx for?
[02:47] <_felix> wceoscar: For real transparency this would be some xorg setting.
[02:47] <Jowi> hello everyone
[02:47] <rada> helping installing OSX
[02:47] <Guerrand> wceoscar: was under the impression it was included in 6.10 ... but i dont seem to have it either : /
[02:47] <ircdevil> howdy
[02:47] <Wooot> How about #macosx
[02:47] <rada> okey
[02:47] <ircdevil> i just installed my first ubuntu - some minor issues during the install (only one freeze) - but how about WPA support?
[02:48] <claus> HELLO
[02:48] <tonyyarusso> Seveas: I'm going to grab a shower, but let me know if you have any brilliant ideas.
[02:48] <DiLupo> rada: 1) installing OSX on a Intel laptop is illegal, unless you have a dev toolkit.... 2) #macosx
[02:48] <ragnar_123> rada: try: /msg NickServ REGISTER
[02:48] <Wooot> ircdevil: I had that exact problem, and gave up on it haha
[02:48] <wceoscar> I have 6.10 but i dont know where i can get it transparent !!
[02:48] <ircdevil> no WPA support out of the box?
[02:48] <Jowi> DiLupo, and unless it is a mac intel laptop :)

[02:58] <TurtleBoots> where is network-manager held? ran from?
[02:59] <fredl> hmm. I'm interested in building an Ubuntu appliance which has one or more of my own 'commercial' applications on it.
[02:59] <whyme> Amaranth, are you there yet?
[03:00] <fredl> Seveas, would that also make me an 'Ubuntu preinstalled reseller' ?
[03:00] <Seveas> depends on the details
[03:01] <fredl> seveas, well my own application will initially be a service that I'll host on my own webserver, companies will pay for the service per pagehit, until their pagehits come to a breakeven point and it becomes more interesting to have their own server instead.
[03:01] <hairk> I have a question. Everytime I want to run an application is root mode, I open the terminal and type "sudo <name_of_app>", is there an easier way of opening an application in root mode from gnome or KDE?

[03:08] <alucard064> how you do this

[03:19] <Seveas> !ask | zhnitamrtvola
[03:19] <ubotu> zhnitamrtvola: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:19] <zhnitamrtvola> does smb.conf settings override filesystem permissions or not?
[03:19] <tonyyarusso> Seveas: Got it!  It was the AllowOverride - in the site-specific config.
[03:19] <Seveas> zhnitamrtvola, no
[03:19] <Seveas> tonyyarusso, nice
[03:19] <zhnitamrtvola> thanx :)
[03:20] <wceoscar> soundray, what should i do with that list?
[03:21] <fredl> I guess all of #mysql is on some mysql camp or something :/
[03:24] <soundray> !repos | wceoscar
[03:24] <ubotu> wceoscar: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:25] <wceoscar> ok... now, i just opened the sources list... now what should i do there to get bebryl o work... im fllowing the steps but i dont uderstand!
[03:25] <tonyyarusso> Is it possible to "pick up the line" with a computer's modem and use that to record phone conversations?
[03:26] <fuffe> does ubuntu have a font handler application were you can install, preview and delete fonts?
[03:27] <soundray> tonyyarusso: I think it may be possible if you write a driver for a software modem ("winmodem") with that capability.
[03:27] <wceoscar> It says that i should add this line deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/  should i add this to the end of the repositories?
[03:27] <tonyyarusso> soundray: Oh fun.  I had enough trouble finding a driver for it to do normal things.
[03:27] <soundray> tonyyarusso: also, with the old voice enabled ZyXEL modems (e.g. 1496) you could do things like that.
[03:28] <thirstyferret> wceoscar: I don't think it really matters
[03:28] <wceoscar> what you mean?
[03:29] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, possible, yes. you need a hardware filter that let the voice to pass to the modem and redirect it back to the phone again though. not all modems support it though.
[03:29] <wceoscar> it says that the lin should be aded to the sources list
[03:29] <tonyyarusso> Jowi: Pass it back?  Why can't it just be like picking up an extension?
[03:29] <thirstyferret> wceoscar: how are you trying to add it to the list?
[03:29] <cherubiel> wceoscar: yes, add that to your sources.lst, do an apt-get update
[03:30] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, the modem usually hijacks the line from the phone when enabled
[03:30] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, like a fax machine do.
[03:30] <nolimitsoya> say i want to dump the contents of a text file to a terminal, how would i do that? i have a text file with all the names of packages i want installed after a cli installation for a completely custom installation, and just typing 'apt-get install <content here>' would be nice. :)
[03:30] <tonyyarusso> Jowi: Icky.  That stinks.
[03:31] <tonyyarusso> nolimitsoya: Is the text file with the package names one per line or all in a row?
[03:31] <soundray> nolimitsoya: cat packagelist | xargs apt-get install
[03:31] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, that's why the dial-up internet connection breaks when you pick up a reciever
[03:31] <boo> hu
[03:31] <boo> i
[03:31] <fredl> bizarre, there is no such tool apparently that does version control on a database / database schema
[03:31] <tonyyarusso> Jowi: Oooh!  That happens all the time at home.
[03:31] <nolimitsoya> tonyyarusso, all in one line, with just spaces between. i though that would simplify things :)
[03:31] <lmh> hi all,I just installed ubuntu 6.10 desktop, but xorg won't start up
[03:32] <joachim-n> what's the package to file a bug on a file's mimetype not being set properly?
[03:32] <tonyyarusso> nolimitsoya: It does - you can leave out xargs from that line then.
[03:32] <tonyyarusso> soundray: Does he need apt-get install - then, or just leave it?
[03:32] <masterninja> oi
[03:32] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, probably less time consuming to buy a device made for recording calls
[03:32] <lmh> lmh
[03:32] <soundray> nolimitsoya: do a "cat packagelist | xargs apt-get -s install" first to test
[03:32] <masterninja> cntrl+alt wont rotate the cube
[03:32] <Dreamglider> why does 6.10 not have long terme support like 6.06 has ?
[03:32] <nolimitsoya> tonyyarusso, so, 'cat <filename> | apt-get install'?
[03:33] <nolimitsoya> soundray, ok
[03:33] <tonyyarusso> Jowi: Yeah well.  I can't justify spending money - I just thought it would be cool.  Asterisk does this stuff though perhaps?
[03:33] <whyme> :9 why isn Amaranth answering me?
[03:33] <boo> I need help! ( ubuntu 6.10 , Core duo cpu (laptop) and the problem : "BUG:Soft lockup detected on CPU#0" )
[03:33] <lmh> but from the cd it worked very well
[03:33] <Jowi> tonyyarusso, oh yeah, easier when on ip-telephony. but that's not what you asked :)
[03:33] <soundray> nolimitsoya: without xargs, the package list is fed to apt-get as stdin. Not what you want.
[03:33] <gnomefreak> whyme: maybe hes not here
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> soundray, im getting 'E: Command line option 'r' [from -r`]  is not known.'
[03:34] <tonyyarusso> Jowi: Well, I'm not yet.  Might be another thing to try fiddling with though.
[03:34] <lmh> log says: /dev
[03:34] <lmh> Error opening /dev/wacom: Success
[03:34] <soundray> nolimitsoya: -s not -r
[03:34] <LjL> lmh: nice error
[03:34] <whyme> gno efreak, well, he deffo here, but AFK...
[03:34] <nolimitsoya> soundray, i am typing -s :)
[03:34] <whyme> grrr...
[03:34] <cherubiel> lmh: do you have any stylus devices?
[03:34] <gnomefreak> whyme: what was teh question
[03:34] <lmh> no, i don't
[03:34] <soundray> nolimitsoya: then the -r is in your packagelist file for some reason
[03:34] <flossgeek> Just wonderin gif anyone has a fix for the openoffice fonts issue in edgy?
[03:34] <cherubiel> lmh: X not starting? whats the problem?
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> soundray, nope, ive just searched it
[03:35] <lmh> only a standard mouse. X not starting, yes
[03:35] <whyme> if he could reduce BW consumption on amaranth.selfip.com before my hosts hut me down....
[03:35] <whyme> :P
[03:35] <cherubiel> lmh: xorg.conf? pastebin?
[03:35] <whyme> and I mean now...
[03:35] <whyme> :S
[03:35] <nolimitsoya> soundray, though, there is the 'linux-headers-`uname -r`... could that be cousing the problem, and if so, why?
[03:36] <masterninja> how do i rotate the cube?
[03:36] <soundray> nolimitsoya: it will be.
[03:36] <gnomefreak> whyme: well now isnt gonna happen im sure of that.
[03:36] <gnomefreak> masterninja: ctrl+alt+arrow
[03:36] <soundray> nolimitsoya: replace it with the output from uname -r on the commandline
[03:36] <masterninja> that wont do it
[03:36] <wceoscar> check out what it displayed on the terminal     bash: $: command not found
[03:36] <wceoscar> wceoscar@wceoscar-desktop:~$ wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/quinn.key.asc

[03:37] <masterninja> whoops i thought i was
[03:37] <lmh> cherubiel: yes, one sec
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> soundray, but that would defeat the purpouse, since id have to change it ever kernel upgrade :/
[03:37] <gnomefreak> wceoscar: please use pastebin
[03:37] <whyme> no choice here, unfortunatly
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> *every
[03:37] <bobbyshafter> or ctrl+alt and left mouse button
[03:37] <soundray> nolimitsoya: why don't you stick with 'apt-get dist-upgrade'?
[03:37] <bobbyshafter> this give more control
[03:37] <appletree> hi2 all
[03:37] <wceoscar> why does it displaus error 404 not found??? is this normal?
[03:37] <whyme> gnomefreak: not really up to me, but hes been using over 90gig per week, when my quota is 200 per month...
[03:37] <nolimitsoya> soundray, i will. this is just to get all the apps and packages i want installed after doing a cli install.
[03:38] <whyme> gnomefreak: after that, I just get blocked.
[03:38] <whyme> :(
[03:38] <gnomefreak> whyme: than i would say dont use it until you find out if he can restrict it
[03:38] <syock> Hiya guys. Do you remember the whole usplash resolution thing? I forgot how to make usplash choose the correct image to use during usplash? I`ve made adjustments to usplash.conf
[03:38] <LjL> wceoscar: it's quite normal, give that URL points to a non-existing file
[03:39] <syock> usplash said one word too many
[03:39] <wceoscar> im i in good shape with my beryl install?
[03:39] <whyme> gnomefreak: I was hoping hed be able to sort it out before I just kill off his site :( I really dont like doing that...
[03:39] <Skyrail>  anyone know of a good skype alternative?
[03:39] <soundray> nolimitsoya: you could also just install the 'linux-headers' metapackage for example, which always depends on the latest version
[03:39] <whyme> gnomefreak: by the way, how do I force redetection of my keyboard?
[03:39] <erdem84>  I have a simple question to be answered what is the minimum disk space for Ubuntu to be installed
[03:39] <whyme> !keyboard
[03:39] <ubotu> Keyboard shortcuts can be set in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts (Gnome) or "input actions" in Kcontrol (KDE). If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try keytouch - http://keytouch.sourceforge.net
[03:40] <gnomefreak> whyme: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:40] <whyme> meh
[03:40] <whyme> ahh, thatnks
[03:40] <soundray> erdem84: about 3 GB is enough
[03:40] <erdem84> ty soundray
[03:40] <nolimitsoya> soundray, that sounds like a swell idea :D its just called 'linux-headers'?
[03:41] <nolimitsoya> soundray, i cant find any such package. would it be called linux-headers-generic, by any chance? :)
[03:41] <whyme> brb
[03:41] <flossgeek> Skyrail: Try OpenWengo http://www.openwengo.com/
[03:41] <lmh> cherubiel: http://pastebin.com/833207
[03:41] <Skyrail> thanks flossgeek
[03:42] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: search "kernel"
[03:42] <flossgeek> Skyrail: no probs...
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, and looking for what?
[03:42] <gnomefreak> linux-headers-your kernel
[03:43] <Jager-> Hello
[03:43] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, im not sure how that would help me... anyway, im all set now :)
[03:44] <cherubiel> lmh: give me a sec
[03:44] <soundray> nolimitsoya: you're right, it's linux-headers-generic in edgy
[03:44] <cherubiel> lmh: can't hit the link
[03:44] <cherubiel> lmh: pm ?
[03:44] <nolimitsoya> soundray, ty very much for your help then :)
[03:45] <woro2006> hi i messed up /etc/fstab, now I am forced to go into readonly filesystem. How can I have write access to edit /etc/fstab again
[03:45] <jimboedgynoob> I'm trying to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy and for some reason the Edgy LIVECD will not install - just grinds away at the CD. The CD check is OK. I am on dialup - can I upgrade from D to E WITHOUT booting off the Live CD? I am running a low RAM system - 256MB Laptop. Dapper runs fine.
[03:46] <soundray> woro2006: easiest is if you have/get a live CD and boot off that.
[03:46] <woro2006> i do
[03:46] <woro2006> I am on that livecd
[03:46] <woro2006> but what do I do now?
[03:46] <wceoscar> why when i paste this on the terminal: sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl    it says the list of sources could no be read??????
[03:46] <soundray> woro2006: do you know the partition name where /etc/fstab is located?
[03:46] <murpc004> HI
[03:47] <woro2006> hda4 or hda5
[03:47] <woro2006> 4 i think
[03:47] <gnomefreak> wceoscar: repo may be down please join #ubuntu-xgl for xgl/compiz/beryl
[03:47] <murpc004> plz can someone give me some help here
[03:47] <woro2006> wceoscar, can't you just algfx
[03:47] <nolimitsoya> soundray, sorry to bother you again, but i hit a rock... it asks for confirmation, but aborts without letting me give it. how do i tell apt to perform without asking for permission?
[03:47] <woro2006> it's easier
[03:48] <soundray> woro2006: assuming it's hda5 (more likely IMO), you would open a terminal and run 'sudo mount /dev/hda5 /mnt && gksudo gedit /mnt/etc/fstab'
[03:48] <nolimitsoya> soundray, never mind me. i found it :) 'man' is very nifty indeed :)
[03:48] <soundray> nolimitsoya: no bother at all! Use the -y option. Also consider spending a bit of time with man apt-get.
[03:49] <whyme> !amaranth
[03:49] <ubotu> For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[03:49] <soundray> nolimitsoya: just as I went to point you to it... ;)
[03:49] <nolimitsoya> soundray, thank you :)
[03:50] <woro2006> these are my options in /etc/fstab for hda4, reiserfs,user_xattr,notail
[03:51] <woro2006> soundray, how do I edit them?
[03:51] <woro2006> I just wanted to enable extra attributes for beagled
[03:52] <Jager`> Bah
[03:52] <Jager`> Power keeps going out everytime I connect..
[03:52] <Jager`> how do I get into my files with write access?
[03:53] <soundray> woro2006: are you sure that this is still necessary in the latest beagle versions?
[03:53] <Jager`> how do I get into my files with write access?
[03:53] <omkar86> Jager: do chmod on it
[03:53] <woro2006> i am not sure
[03:53] <woro2006> but do you know how?
[03:54] <Jager`> omar86: how do  chmod?
[03:54] <jimboedgynoob>  I'm trying to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy and for some reason the Edgy LIVECD will not install - just grinds away at the CD. The CD check is OK. I am on dialup - can I upgrade from D to E WITHOUT booting off the Live CD? I am running a low RAM system - 256MB Laptop. Dapper runs fine.
[03:54] <mixo8114> Hi
[03:54] <soundray> woro2006: how what?
[03:54] <Jager`> !chmod
[03:54] <ubotu> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[03:54] <soundray> woro2006: running beagle?
[03:54] <soundray> !beagle
[03:54] <ubotu> beagle: indexing and search tool for your personal data. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.9-1ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 804 kB, installed size 3160 kB
[03:55] <lmh> Hi all, my XOrg won't start, LOG does not show an (EE) section
[03:55] <Jager`> How do i use chmod in terminal?
[03:55] <woro2006> soundray, how do I edit /etc/fstab
[03:55] <lmh> my xorg.conf: http://pastebin.ca/258437
[03:55] <woro2006> to enable the extra attributes
[03:56] <woro2006> this is my /etc/fstab UUID=b739d0d3-0f4c-4eb6-b56d-eb2ba668dd0b /               reiserfs,user_xattr,notail          0       1
[03:56] <Jowi> lmh, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[03:56] <soundray> woro2006: why don't you go back to defaults first and make sure that your system boots again.
[03:56] <omkar86> Jager: there are permission bits associated with chmod, its worth studying them and then use chmod :)
[03:56] <omkar86> do man chmod
[03:56] <soundray> woro2006: the comma after reiserfs is wrong
[03:56] <woro2006> oh
[03:57] <woro2006> thanks
[03:57] <woro2006> now I will reboot
[03:57] <woro2006> see you in a bit
[03:57] <jimboedgynoob> has that guy reiser been found guilty or not guilty of murder yet?
[03:57] <soundray> jimboedgynoob: that's off topic. Ask a support question
[03:57] <Jowi> jimboedgynoob, #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:57] <omkar86> Jager: read man page $man chmod
[03:58] <jimboedgynoob> sorry just wondered
[03:58] <jimboedgynoob> I have asked a support question twice.
[03:58] <jimboedgynoob> I will ask it again.
[03:59] <jimboedgynoob> I'm trying to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy and for some reason the Edgy LIVECD will not install - just grinds away at the CD. The CD check is OK. I am on dialup - can I upgrade from D to E WITHOUT booting off the Live CD? I am running a low RAM system - 256MB Laptop. Dapper runs fine.
[03:59] <Jager`> Guys
[03:59] <Toma-> jimboedgynoob: you could add the cdrom as an apt source and just dist-upgrade that way?
[03:59] <Jager`> i cant change permissions of folders using chmod
[04:00] <Jager`> sudo chmod +w /folder/location/ to allow write access tot hat folder right?
[04:00] <TLE> Hey when I came home after being away for the weekend all of the sudden firefox won't start. No error massage of anything. If I do a ps from the terminal I can see that it is running but it doesn't show up. Any ideas ?
[04:00] <Jager`> Good this stupid computer is locked to everything i try
[04:00] <Toma-> Jager`: yeh, but only for root
[04:00] <jimboedgynoob> Toma I tried to add to Synaptic but it just wants to download off the net - should I try to disconnect and have Edgy as the only repositry?
[04:00] <Jager`> -_-
[04:00] <soundray> Jager`: yes, but you need write permissions in /folder/ before you can change /folder/location
[04:00] <Jowi> TLE, "kill" it. then start firefox from a terminal to see if there are any errors
[04:01] <whyme> jimboedgynoob, uncheck all the other sources
[04:01] <Toma-> jimboedgynoob: disable everything except the livecd that you're going to add
[04:01] <soundray> Jager`: you would make it easier for yourself if you made yourself familiar with the Linux way of doing things
[04:01] <soundray> Jager`: like storing all user data in $HOME
[04:01] <whyme> jimboedgynoob, and make sure that the keyword is edgy, else you wont upgrade at all...
[04:01] <Jager`> How do I make it so I can just go in the folder and add/delete files
[04:02] <Jager`> but soundray, it was installed by the app/remove utility
[04:02] <TLE> Jowi: I did, there isn't. I also tried to remove my .mozilla folder to make sure that it wasn't anything I'd done, like a plugin er something. That didn't work either
[04:02] <jimboedgynoob> tried that whyme OK will give it another try thanks guys - Ahhhh the keyword is EDGY thanks again
[04:02] <soundray> Jager`: what was installed?
[04:02] <whyme> :P
[04:02] <whyme> methinks....
[04:02] <Jager`> soundray: XMMS
[04:02] <Jowi> TLE, does it work with another user?
[04:02] <woro2006> soundray
[04:03] <woro2006> i am back
[04:03] <soundray> Jager`: okay, so what do you want to do now?
[04:03] <whyme> itll be edgy universe multiverse etc...
[04:03] <Jager`> soundray: I need to get to the XMMS folder so I can add a skin
[04:03] <soundray> woro2006: fixed your fstab then
[04:03] <woro2006> it's fixed :)
[04:03] <TLE> Haven't tried. I usually only have one user. I'll try it
[04:03] <sysrage> any known issues with firefox in kubuntu? it's super buggy for me. dialog windows are opening up super tiny and if i make them bigger they don't have the content on them that they should. mousing over menu items turns the background grey and gets all fugly. etc
[04:03] <woro2006> thanks. do you know how come I can't access my own ip address at any ports?
[04:04] <wceoscar> im getting everithig done... now when i enter this in X sudo apt-get install beryl emerald-themes
[04:04] <wceoscar>  it says: E: Couldn't find package emerald-themes
[04:04] <woro2006> I can ping myself, but couldn't visit my apache website using my ppp ip address
[04:04] <woro2006> I am behind a Westell router and enable port forwarding on port 80
[04:04] <omkar86> jimboedgynoob:afaik u can do upgrade from alternate cd and not desktop cd
[04:04] <soundray> woro2006: you need to set the address that httpd listens to in the apache config.
[04:05] <Jager`> tried http://localhost?
[04:05] <jimboedgynoob> omkar so a livecd upgrade WITHOUT BOOTING from it is out of the question?
[04:05] <woro2006> i can visit the site locally, just not from the outside
[04:06] <Jowi> wceoscar, you need to get it from the beryl repository (it is not a part of ubuntu). try asking in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:06] <Jager`> How can I get into my XMMS folder to add a skin?
[04:06] <jedi__> Eclipse keep crashed when open C/CPP file,any one can help me?
[04:06] <soundray> Jager`: add it in $HOME/.xmms
[04:06] <jedi__> 6.10 ubuntu
[04:07] <omkar86> jimboedgynoob: u can do clean install using desktop cd, but if u plan to do things with apt-get then u can do upgrade from desktopcd(possibly unsafe way)
[04:07] <jedi__> Eclipse and CDT from deb-src
[04:07] <Jager`> soundray: Thanks :)

[04:09] <jimboedgynoob> thanks for your time omkar - I'll stick with dapper for now. Edgy Eft LIVECD would not even utilise the swapfile sitting on the hard disk that dapper was happy to use when installing. A noted bug - but hilarious that Edgy states 128MB minimum as an install - more like half a gig!

[04:09] <Zaehlas> Hello.  I have a disk space problem, if someone can help.  using baobab, disk space usage, my file system reports 42.3 GB of space allocated, however, when I do the filesystem scan, to show me what is allocated where, my entire root partition is only using 3.6 GB.  I have no other mounted volumes (except swap, which is 2 GB).  How do I fix it so it's showing the correct amount?  I have deleted that many gigs worth of files, but it's not "

[04:12] <Zaehlas> LjL: It shows 44388996 used blocks, 25967916 free blocks, 64% usage on /dev/sda1, my only hard drive.  all the rest appear to be device symbolic links of some sort.
[04:12] <TLE> Jowi: another user didn't work either
[04:13] <Zaehlas> LjL: But I know I shouldn't have that many gigs in use.
[04:13] <theplatypus> can anyone help with a usb problem? output of dmesg can be found here. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34135/
[04:13] <n1gke> My question is this. Ok. I am trying to add the drivers for the dual head video card, although the shell script shows a different directory path, I have created the needed path for the script.
[04:13] <LjL> Zaehlas: look, i haven't used baobab (i'm on KDE), but isn't it supposed to let you know graphically where the space is being taken up?
[04:13] <n1gke> When X starts, where is it looking for the driver files, normally ?
[04:13] <shooters> Zaehlas: what does baobab shows when you do a file usage mapping... What takes up that much space?
[04:13] <Jowi> TLE, open up synaptic and search for firefox. click firefox and select "mark for complete removal" and apply. after the removal is done reinstall firefox.
[04:14] <soundray> theplatypus: I think this indicates faulty hardware
[04:14] <TLE> Jowi: will try that
[04:14] <theplatypus> soundray: usb hardware or mb?
[04:14] <Jowi> TLE, you can also see if you have any plugins installed system-wide and remove them to see if it makes a difference
[04:14] <soundray> theplatypus: I had a PCMCIA USB card causing these messages. Replacing it cured it.
[04:14] <Zaehlas> LjL: yes, it shows graphiocally, that only 4 gigs of space on my HD used up.   shooters: baobab is not showing that much used up.  can I have blocks in use, without them being truly allocated to files?   if so, how do I fix that?
[04:14] <KenSentMe> n1gke: what videocard do you have?
[04:15] <n1gke> KenSentMe, I amusing the Matrox G400 dual head video card
[04:15] <theplatypus> soundray : It worked fine then suddenly stopped about two weeks ago
[04:15] <theplatypus> soundray : it also happens with different devices
[04:15] <n1gke> KenSentMe, I have edited the xorg.conf file to include 2nd monitor and its infos.
[04:16] <Tjoels> i have a problem with frostwire. it won't open. it just gives an error when i open it in the console. when opening it with the icon in the ubuntu menu, nothing happends. this is the error from the console: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34136/
[04:16] <soundray> theplatypus: like I say, it sounds like a faulty hub.
[04:16] <n1gke> KenSentMe, but when re-starting x, it barfs with error message and goes to terminal.
[04:16] <theplatypus> soundray: thanks for the replies
[04:16] <LjL> Zaehlas: i think that with journaling filesystems, you *can* have space that shows up as allocated, while it's really been freed, but the garbage collector hasn't kicked in yet. did you remove many very large files just recently?
[04:16] <admin123> is anyone inhere able to play real media files with totem?
[04:16] <KenSentMe> n1gke: sorry, i don't know anything about matrox cards
[04:17] <n1gke> KenSentMe, I can get back here by using sudo cp xorg.conf.backup xorg.conf.
[04:17] <soundray> Tjoels: edit runFrost.sh and replace /bin/sh in the first line with /bin/bash
[04:17] <Paddy_EIRE> Tjoels: I get thae same error with limewire
[04:17] <Tjoels> soundray: ok, cool, thanks :)
[04:17] <n1gke> KenSentMe, thanks anyway dude/dudette. I am part way to making it work as the x display doesn't look gibberish at least.
[04:17] <TLE> Jowi: marking it for somplete removal claims it want'd to uninstall some other things: ekiga, firefox-gnome-support, gnome-app-install, gxine, ubuntu-desktop, yelp. I don
[04:17] <Tjoels> Paddy_EIRE: look what soundray said.. :)
[04:17] <Zaehlas> LjL: yes, I was doing some restores between several other systems, I finished those, and do not have any more network mounts, but I deleted close to the amount that shows, but isn't free.  about 36 gigs or so.  but it's been over a week.   how do I manually kick in the garbage collector?

[04:18] <LjL> Zaehlas: try running an fsck
[04:18] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | TLE
[04:18] <ubotu> TLE: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[04:18] <Zaehlas> LjL, is that safe any time, or is it best to dump system down to terminal, and run it through the bootstrap?

[04:19] <Jowi> TLE, no probs. after removal is done reinstall ubuntu-desktop and you will get all those apps back
[04:19] <LjL> Zaehlas: you shouldn't fsck a mounted filesystem (at least, you should only ever do that with fsck in check-only mode, no writes)
[04:19] <LjL> Zaehlas: best would be instructing Ubuntu to run an fsck at next boot. let me find out how ;)

[04:20] <Tjoels> soundray: where is runFrost.sh located?
[04:20] <LjL> soundray: thanks. isn't there also a "dirty" flag on the FS, that should somehow be settable?
[04:21] <LjL> i.e. the same flag that stays set if you don't unmount cleanly
[04:21] <Zaehlas> soundray: will that force an immediate fsck, or will add it to next boot sequence?

[04:46] <Warbo> Hmmm... I would try running "top" and seeing if there is a program using far too many resources
[04:46] <Kishore> ubotu, kernel
[04:46] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[04:46] <Warbo> (that was to alek66 by the way ^)
[04:46] <dabaR> Tjoels: if we remember...
[04:46] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: latest release
[04:47] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: there are several versions a linux, windows, mac, and other version.
[04:47] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: im using the proper linux version
[04:47] <dabaR> http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther is the link.
[04:47] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: so you downloaded a .rpm?
[04:47] <alek66> Warbo, i have beryl running
[04:47] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: i converted with alien
[04:47] <Warbo> aren;t the Limewire verisons the same, since they all use the same JAR file?
[04:47] <Zaehlas> Anyone else have an idea why my filesystem won't free up space after deleting files?  they were deleted last week, I can't find any other reasons that I would have files taking up over 30 gigs of space, and fsck, repeat runs at boot time, won't free up that space.
[04:47] <Tjoels> dabaR: i downloaded the .deb from the official frostwire site....
[04:47] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: always worked perfectly in the past
[04:48] <Warbo> alek66: What graphics driver are you running?
[04:48] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: that may be it. Download this version from above so we can work with the same versions, me and you.
[04:48] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: ok
[04:48] <Warbo> Zaehlas: Bad blocks? :(
[04:48] <alek66> Warbo, geforce fx go5700 64mbddr agp
[04:49] <Morrissey>  Hi, I want to use the absolutely latest "radeon" drivers for my ATI Radeon 9000 card. Im currently using the "radeon" drivers wich works ok with aixgl, but I want to get the lates drivers .. how do I do that?
[04:49] <Warbo> alek66: did you install Nvidia's driver, or leave it with the default?
[04:49] <Zaehlas> Warbo: none that fsck reports, and the filesystem is mounted on a mirrored raid, which the raid tools report that it's good.
[04:49] <Music_Shuffle> Zaehlas, stating the obvious here, but did you make sure to clear the trash too?  I find myself doing that often...forget to clear it out of the trash. >.>
[04:49] <Warbo> Zaehlas: OK, well I am guessing you have already tried everything I might suggest next :)
[04:49] <Zaehlas> Music_Shuffle: Good idea, and yes, I had already cleared the trash.
[04:50] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: downloaded
[04:50] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: has same error...
[04:50] <Paddy_EIRE> 1 sec
[04:50] <Music_Shuffle> That's the extent of my ability to help then. ./steps back to let someone else be more useful
[04:50] <Zaehlas> Warbo: pretty much.  it's just phantom data or something.  the graphical file usage does a scan, only shows 3.6 gigs used up, but every other utility reports 42 gigs used up
[04:50] <alek66> Warbo, i used http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ lrm nvidia driver
[04:50] <Music_Shuffle> Wow.  Rather...large difference. >.>
[04:51] <Warbo> Zaehlas: Maybe there is a massive sparse file somewhere? I think different apps handle them differently
[04:51] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: that was the win version you gave me to download
[04:51] <Zaehlas> Music_Shuffle: aye.  if it was a gig or two, I wouln;t be worried....
[04:51] <Warbo> alek66: OK, I was just going to suggest that if you left it on the default then Beryl would definetly go slow, but since you are using the nvidia one it shouldn't
[04:51] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: no..does it have runLime.sh in there?
[04:51] <Paddy_EIRE> yes
[04:51] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: and I found the solution.
[04:52] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: k
[04:52] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: just edit the runlime file and change /bin/sh to /bin/bash
[04:52] <alek66> Warbo, thanks.... from time  to time it gets really slow
[04:52] <Zaehlas> Warbo: Well, I'm relying on the Baobab disk usage analyzer, and that's what is supposed to tell me what's really on my system.  anyone else have a suggestion on a better way to scan, to see if there's a hidden file, or something?
[04:52] <dabaR> then run it again, should work.
[04:52] <alek66> even at boot up
[04:52] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: 1 sec
[04:52] <Tjoels> Paddy_EIRE: will you please pm me if you solve it?
[04:53] <Paddy_EIRE> Tjoels: sure
[04:53] <Tjoels> thanks
[04:53] <Tjoels> :)
[04:53] <Warbo> alek66: I don't know what to suggest really, as I have gone through the obvious things. Personally I haven't used Beryl, and haven't used Nvidia in about 6 months
[04:53] <Warbo> alek66: sorry :(
[04:53] <ryanakca> how do you set your console to use python2.5 by default instead of 2.4?
[04:53] <nox-Hand> thirstyferret, What the devil are you doing here?
[04:53] <fuffe> I have a question about bugs and ubuntu.. why does bugs on third party apps such as gphpedit turns up in launchpad?
[04:54] <alek66> Warbo, thanks anyway
[04:54] <fuffe> etc: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gphpedit/+bug/46487
[04:54] <thirstyferret> nox-Hand learning ;)
[04:54] <nox-Hand> thirstyferret, Hah
[04:54] <fuffe> gphpedit is developed by the gphpedit team, not by ubuntu, right?
[04:54] <Seveas> fuffe, that's a bug in the ubuntu gphpedit package
[04:54] <Warbo> fuffe: Launchpad can trakc other bug trackers, so that Ubuntu users just have to report all of their bugs to Launchpad and any upstream bugs will be added to the bug report
[04:55] <Seveas> fuffe, if it were an upstream bug, it would be /products/gphpedit/+bug/46487
[04:55] <hyper_ch> Seveas: did you temporarily ban "abo"?
[04:55] <pianoboy3333> Anyone know of another parental control software besides dansguardian? Has anyone here ever tried CensorNet?
[04:55] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: that works... :) but I use limewire pro which is paid for, that fix doesnt seem to work with that
[04:55] <fuffe> ok..
[04:56] <Paddy_EIRE> Tjoels: u there
[04:56] <Tjoels> Paddy_EIRE: yea
[04:56] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: it has exactly the same ./runLime.sh file?
[04:56] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: i think so
[04:57] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: do some comparison...
[04:57] <dabaR> at least up to that line.
[04:57] <Paddy_EIRE> k
[04:57] <Demon> can any1 help me with this? i cannot remove the map e107_plugins, permission is denied, but the chmod is 777
[04:57] <dabaR> And you get the same exact error?
[04:58] <Demon> can any1 help me with this? i cannot remove the map e107_plugins, permission is denied, but the chmod is 777
[04:59] <dabaR> Tjoels: your fix is a little different.
[04:59] <hikenboot> hello all--anyone know which file i would put the variable DHCPDARGS=eth0 in other distros reference /etc/sysconfig but that doesnt exist on ubuntu
[04:59] <dabaR> Tjoels: edit /usr/bin/frostwire change sh /blah/blah to bash /blah/blah and save, close, then run frostwire again.
[05:00] <Warbo> Hmmm. Googling for people with the same SATA problem on a Dell Inspiron 1501 (HD isn't detected) seems to say that the boot option "acpi=force irqpoll" fixes it, but I tried that and it didn't help :(
[05:00] <dabaR> hikenboot: why are you setting that variable?
[05:00] <dabaR> hikenboot: following a tutorial?
[05:00] <hikenboot> so that the dhcpd will only listen on that interface
[05:00] <dabaR> hikenboot: well....you have a dhcpd on your computer?
[05:01] <Zaehlas> what is the website to upload a screenshot to, to link in here?  paste.ubuntu something?
[05:01] <hikenboot> yes
[05:01] <dabaR> Zaehlas: /topic
[05:01] <Tjoels> dabaR: you mean the /usr/lib/frostwire/runFrost.sh ?
[05:01] <Zaehlas> Thank you
[05:01] <Demon> any1 plz? i really need it removed to go on
[05:01] <dabaR> Tjoels: I wrote exactly what I mean, I checked, why is it not working the way I said?
[05:01] <dabaR> hikenboot: and what is the name of thwe program you installed for dhcpd?
[05:02] <hikenboot> apt-get install bind I believe
[05:02] <hikenboot> no sorry
[05:02] <dabaR> bind is not a dhcpd.
[05:02] <hikenboot> right I know
[05:02] <dabaR> which one?
[05:02] <dabaR> dhcp3-server?
[05:02] <Tjoels> dabaR: ahh, sorry..
[05:02] <dabaR> Tjoels: no worries
[05:03] <hikenboot> no apt-get install dhcp
[05:03] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: same error
[05:03] <hikenboot> should i have chosen dhcp3-server?
[05:03] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: is that the ./runLime.sh you posted at first?
[05:03] <Paddy_EIRE> yes
[05:03] <Demon> can any1 help me with this? i cannot remove the map e107_plugins, permission is denied, but the chmod is 777
[05:04] <Tjoels> dabaR: it works! thanks!
[05:04] <Warbo> Demon: It is probably like that for a reason, but if you insist then "sudo -s -H" should give you a superuser shell. Delete it in that (rm <filename>" then press Ctrl-D to exit superuser
[05:05] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: I then copied the working "runLime.sh" to "/usr/lib/LimeWire" and still I get the same error
[05:05] <dabaR> Tjoels: welcome
[05:05] <Demon> warbo: thanks, ofcource :P i forgot the sudo command infront of it :D ty!!!
[05:05] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: and you got the rpm of the pay version of LImewire?
[05:05] <hikenboot> dabaR, should i have installed dhcp3-server instead?
[05:05] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: yes
[05:06] <Warbo> Demon: Ah. Try jsut "sudo rm <filename>" then. If that fails then "sudo -s -H" should give you unlimited powers (thereofre exit it as soon as possible)
[05:06] <dabaR> hikenboot: I am still looking into it.
[05:06] <wildchild> how can I checj whos' on the server, command finger doesn't work
[05:07] <Warbo> OK, I can't fix my problem with Dapper so I'll try out some convoluted method of booting from USB hard drive. See you all :)
[05:07] <dabaR> hikenboot: edit /etc/default/dhcp
[05:07] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: i think i got a temp solution thanks man
[05:07] <antoniod> hello, I can't boot from ubuntu cd
[05:07] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: good work.
[05:08] <antoniod> I select start or install ubuntu, and then the cd stops
[05:08] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: I extracted the rpm and changed the "runLime.sh" as you said and now it runs straight from the folder
[05:09] <hikenboot> thanks dabaR
[05:09] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: ya, it may be that the installation messes it up because it is not built for the Ubuntu way of having something in /usr, something in /bin, and so on
[05:09] <dabaR> hikenboot: welcome
[05:09] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: oh, although it always worked in dapper
[05:10] <hikenboot> I would like to know where you found that I was unable to
[05:10] <Paddy_EIRE> maybe its a simple little bug to be fixed gonna email the co. to see if they can provide a full fixed version
[05:11] <Paddy_EIRE> dabaR: thanks dabaR see ya later
[05:11] <dabaR> hikenboot: see this pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34145/ i is alias for sudo aptitude install. Let me know if you need further explanation.
[05:11] <dabaR> Paddy_EIRE: see ya

[05:31] <dm_> Anyone know how to change the session splash screen ?
[05:31] <boink> that's a good idea as well .. you can use bzip2 or gzip to do that
[05:31] <lmh> I installed Ubuntu 6.10 desktop from scratch, installation worked perfect but after installation xorg does not start
[05:31] <mojojojo_> dabaR, it worked after I changed from default to other. But it's xmms, firefox will still refuse to play anything for example
[05:31] <dabaR> dm_: the gnome login splash screen?
[05:31] <dabaR> mojojojo_: like flash sound?
[05:32] <alecjw> lmh: have you canged the monitor/grpahics card?
[05:32] <dabaR> mojojojo_: well, at least you can listen to music while we fix it...
[05:32] <mojojojo_> dabaR, like flash sound :)
[05:32] <boink> firefox never plays anything
[05:32] <boink> it depends on how you've set up firefox
[05:32] <mojojojo_> dabaR,  yeah :D :D
[05:32] <blair> hello
[05:32] <lmh> alecjw: no
[05:32] <dabaR> mojojojo_: you should read the flash section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats , I saw some fixes there, but never had to apply any.
[05:33] <alecjw> lmh: is it an LCD? does it say "out of range" or simmilar?
[05:33] <flos> thank you, boink
[05:33] <flos> bye
[05:33] <blair> Can anyone see my text?
[05:33] <fyrestrtr> lmh: how far do you get?
[05:33] <boink> good luck
[05:33] <boink> blair: yes
[05:33] <boink> !ask

[05:33] <idj> using Edgy, how can i obtain the IP address of the network interface? (other than the 127.0.1.1 that the hostname of the system resolve to)
[05:34] <DevC> i did the upgrades that the site recommended by doing 'sudo apt-get remove firefox mozilla-firefox' and then 'sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox' like it said and now I no longer have a browser to use o_O
[05:34] <fyrestrtr> lmh: decrease your default resolution. In xorg.conf, for the depth 24, remove the 1600x1200
[05:34] <lmh> fyrestrtr: LOGFILE: http://pastebin.ca/258520
[05:34] <fyrestrtr> lmh: yes I saw it.
[05:34] <dm_> dabaR yep, got it, its in Gconf-editor
[05:34] <m0> how do I run a command from gnome-terminal
[05:34] <dabaR> DevC: what web site?
[05:34] <lmh> fyrestrtr: ok, try it
[05:34] <DevC> I tell it to run firefox and it popsup saying "Starting firefox" and then closes and nothing else happens
[05:34] <m0> i want to automatically run irssi
[05:34] <m0> from selecting an icon
[05:35] <fyrestrtr> m0: create a desktop icon for it, or a launcher on the panel.
[05:35] <dabaR> m0: from clicking a launcher icon?
[05:35] <DevC> dabaR: the official website for upgrading from 5.04 to 6.10 through steps
[05:35] <m0> But I want the Gnome-Terminal profile to be set to IRSSI
[05:35] <Dreamglider> does anyone know how i can make a chart with two curves in open office calc ?
[05:35] <dabaR> DevC: well, let me point out that fficially ubuntu recommends upgrading version by version
[05:35] <lmh> fyrestrtr: no difference, does not start, but always filckrs
[05:35] <dabaR> m0: you want to always open irssi when you open a terminal?
[05:36] <m0> dabar, that link...
[05:36] <lmh> fyrestrtr: the natural resolution of my lcd is 1600x1200
[05:36] <fyrestrtr> lmh: what video card is this?
[05:36] <lmh> fyrestrtr: mga g550
[05:36] <sysrage> what's the name of the recommended JRE package?
[05:36] <dabaR> DevC: cat /etc/issue
[05:36] <fyrestrtr> m0: edit your profile, in the Title and Command tab, tick the 'Run a custom command instead of my shell' and type irssi
[05:37] <webmaren> i want to upgrade to 6.10, but the first time i tried my computer crashed inexplicably halfway through and i had to reinstall back from breezy
[05:37] <superlion> howdy
[05:37] <fyrestrtr> webmaren: why didn't you just install edgy?
[05:37] <superlion> when i do apt-get update it tells me "W: GPG error: http://download.tuxfamily.org edgy Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 2D6CFB44DD800CD9"

[05:37] <dennister> has anyone used the cvs version of lirc, as per www.lirc.org's suggestion for kernels > 2.6.17?
[05:37] <m0> fyrestrtr: where do I see that
[05:37] <superlion> how can i add the GPG key to my system?
[05:37] <webmaren> fyrestrtr: i have a breexy disk
[05:37] <fyrestrtr> lmh: I'm not familiar with that, try reducing your default depth and resolution to 1024x768@16
[05:37] <dabaR> superlion: do you want to download a package from http://download.tuxfamily.org?
[05:38] <webmaren> oh wait i should burn and edgy disk
[05:38] <sysrage> dabaR: thanks. that brings me to another question. what's the difference between universe and multiverse?

[05:38] <fyrestrtr> m0: open gnome terminal, the Edit > Profiles
[05:38] <i7ch> is there a way to remove totem-plugin without removing ubuntu-desktop? i don't know why apt is insisting on it
[05:38] <fyrestrtr> lmh: does the desktop cd work?
[05:38] <dabaR> sysrage: read the components page.
[05:38] <dabaR> !repos > sysrage
[05:38] <lmh> fyrestrtr: perfectly
[05:38] <sysrage> ty again
[05:38] <fyrestrtr> i7ch: you can safely remove ubuntu-desktop, its just a meta-package.
[05:38] <fyrestrtr> lmh: at your native res?
[05:38] <Dheeraj_k> is it possible to make deb package of already installed application?
[05:39] <lmh> fyrestrtr: yes, 1600x1200 @ 60Hz
[05:39] <lmh> fyrestrtr: with the same xorg.conf
[05:39] <fyrestrtr> lmh: I don't know then, sorry. I don't have any experience with MGA :( Only nvidia and ati.
[05:40] <Dheeraj_k> is it possible?
[05:40] <Dheeraj_k> to make deb package
[05:40] <fyrestrtr> lmh: could be a known issue, have you checked lp?
[05:40] <dabaR> i7ch: it will not remove any of your apps, ubuntu-desktop depends on the plugin, as it is a list of packages common to ubuntu desktop
[05:40] <Dheeraj_k> of already installed application?
[05:40] <dabaR> i7ch: totem plugin for firefox?
[05:40] <Dheeraj_k> hmmm
[05:40] <i7ch> dabaR, yeah, thanks (and you too fyrestrtr), i've just removed it
[05:41] <Dheeraj_k> ?
[05:41] <dabaR> i7ch: I hate that plugin too:)
[05:41] <i7ch> dabaR, totem is a disaster in general
[05:41] <we2by> guys
[05:41] <lmh> fyrestrtr: what is lp?
[05:41] <defrysk> i7ch, its not
[05:41] <we2by> how do I play high definition video?
[05:41] <dabaR> i7ch: are you gonna install another plugin for firefox movies?
[05:41] <defrysk> runs greatly here
[05:41] <i7ch> dabaR, mplayer plugin
[05:42] <dabaR> i7ch: I like playing files in their "proper" app, so I don't
[05:42] <fyrestrtr> lmh: launchpad, the ubuntu bugtracker.
[05:42] <idj> programming question: how can i obtain the IP address of the network interface? (other than the 127.0.1.1 that the hostname of the system resolves to)
[05:42] <Dheeraj_k> i distributed more than 40+ ubuntu cd among my friends but most of them don't have internet so they can not download needed package
[05:42] <rollfilm> Does someone know why edgy slows down during boot while processing /scripts/local-top? What is /scripts/local-top?
[05:42] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: how did you install?
[05:42] <i7ch> idj: ifconfig
[05:42] <lmh> fyrestrtr: no, did not check yet
[05:43] <DevC> sorry closed the wrong window
[05:43] <shwag> how can I check if I have usb1 or usb2 ?
[05:43] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: keep your question in one line, I almost missed it
[05:43] <idj> i7ch: you mean parsing the output of ifconfig?
[05:43] <Dheeraj_k> using apt
[05:43] <fredl> Hmm, what's the apropriate way to determine which modules get loaded at boot time these days?
[05:43] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: the packages can be found in /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:43] <i7ch> i have another question, speaking of which: how do i change the default app gnome launches to play mp3s? right click -> open with brings up the "open [this file]  and other files of type mp3 with this app", which works, but it defaults back to "Music player" immediately thereafter. i can't get the setting to hold.
[05:43] <fredl> this bcm43xx modules keeps locking up my system...
[05:43] <Dheeraj_k> to download and install needed package from net!
[05:44] <we2by> how do I play high definition video?
[05:44] <Doow> i7ch: in the File Browser, select properties of a mp3 file, then you can set it someplace tehre
[05:44] <defrysk> i7ch, go to properties of the file iso open with
[05:44] <shwag> how can I check if I have usb1 or usb2 ?  I am only getting about 1 meg a second while copying..but im suppose to have usb2 i beleive. Dont know what is bringing down the speed.
[05:45] <i7ch> ah finally, thanks!
[05:45] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: on your system the packages are in that directory after you install them, so copy them from there, and manually install them on the other computers...even install them manually only on one computer, and make a script with all the commands you ran, then just run the script on the other computers.
[05:45] <DiamonD> Hiya
[05:45] <DiamonD> i have a'n question but don't know where to ask

[05:46] <alecjw> Guardian: use linux-genreic instead
[05:46] <Guardian> so i don't need to change anything when i previously uninstalled linux-386 in favor of linux-686 ?
[05:46] <Dheeraj_k> but if package is alredy installed than?
[05:46] <Demon> Can anybody help me getting back my username for my mysql database, i lost it :(
[05:46] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: and run PS1="" before you run the command so you don't have to erase the prompt from every line
[05:46] <alecjw> Demon: does the root account work?
[05:46] <defrysk> Guardian, nope
[05:46] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: the package is still there, did you at least look already?
[05:46] <Jim> How can I turn of the x serve and be in init 3?
[05:46] <DevC> dabaR: cat /etc/issue outputs Ubuntu 5.10
[05:47] <shwag> fyrestrtr: it looks like the main thing is if I have a USB1 device plugged in on that bus...it slows down the whole bus.
[05:47] <DiamonD> i want to add a srt file into a dvd movie i allready ripped on my hdd
[05:47] <Demon> alecjw: i know that yes, but i setted a different account up for my mysql db
[05:47] <DiamonD> are there simple tools for it or a'n howto ?
[05:47] <dabaR> DevC: so you have that version then? what code name is shown in cat /etc/apt/sources.list?
[05:47] <dabaR> Demon: what was the account name?
[05:47] <fyrestrtr> shwag: that's USB for ya :)
[05:48] <DiamonD> where can i ask questions like this
[05:48] <Demon> dabar: i lost the username, i know the password
[05:48] <alecjw> Demon: in one of the tabs for mysql adminsitrator, it will give you a list of users
[05:48] <dabaR> Demon: you can not create a user name if you do not know what its user name will be:)
[05:48] <Jim> Hello, can anyone help me with some video card driver issues?
[05:48] <Demon> dabar: i created it, but i forgot now :P
[05:48] <Doow> Demon: if you have access to the root account of the myswl db there's pretty good documentation at the official site about account management
[05:48] <Doow> mysql*
[05:49] <dabaR> Demon: unless some system table still has the name, go ask on #mysql
[05:49] <Demon> doow: i think i can, im the root user... but im noob at mysql
[05:49] <Dheeraj_k> i found most of the package installed here /usr/share so if i take the backup of that directory and save it on other pc than is it going to work?
[05:49] <Demon> k il ask there
[05:49] <dabaR> Dheeraj_k: if all needed packages are there, it should be possible to install all the needed packages on the other systems.
[05:50] <mdeboer> hello. i have only 1 network interface, and it did not work until i activated eth1 instead of eth0. no idea what eth0 refers to... any idea how i can find out, and how i can tell the system to use the network card as eth0?
[05:50] <DevC> dabaR: both Hoary and Breezy are shown in sources.list
[05:50] <Captain_Redbeard> Hmmm.... is there a ubuntu package of a later version of blackdown java than 1.4? :P I need java 1.6 and don't know how to sort it
[05:50] <mdeboer> in general, i is not clear how hardware detection works with edgy...
[05:50] <dabaR> mdeboer: what commands activated eth1? show your /etc/network/interfaces on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[05:50] <Dheeraj_k> cool
[05:50] <Dheeraj_k> thanx
[05:51] <dabaR> DevC: post in to the pastebin site ^^
[05:51] <Captain_Redbeard> anyone?
[05:51] <dabaR> DevC: and aptitude search firefox
[05:51] <Jim> I've been doing about 2 straight days of work trying to get my video card to work

[05:54] <fyrestrtr> Jim: what package?
[05:54] <dabaR> no 0 just 1
[05:55] <Jim> but I can't get into init 3 without the GUI turning on
[05:55] <mdeboer> dabaR, and I do care, because i have lost time trying to figure out why ethernet was not working
[05:55] <Jim> um

[05:56] <mdeboer> dabaR, ifconfig obviously only lists eth1
[05:57] <Jim> Well the installer says I need to be in init 3, and x serve needs to be off at the same time, ubuntu doesn't seem to want to do it
[05:57] <Jim> I turn off x serve and go into init 3, then the GUI turns on
[05:57] <mdeboer> dabaR, what does the mobo have to do with it
[05:57] <dabaR> mdeboer: then the kernel does not think there is a 0, so it may be some config thing with the hardware

[05:57] <Jim> fyrestrtr:it is very weird
[05:58] <mdeboer> dabaR that is
[05:58] <dabaR> mdeboer: I seriously think that we should not fix something that works
[05:58] <abo> !bug > abo
[05:58] <Guardian> hmm why do i need samba to ping by netbios name ??? i thought winbind was enough
[05:58] <mdeboer> dabaR: i seriously think that a user should not be required to guess that he should replace auto eth0 with auto eth1 in a configuration file

[05:59] <dasholzbein> thx. I ll take a look.
[05:59] <mdeboer> dabaR: before filing a bugreport, i first want to understand what is going wrong here

[06:00] <Jim> fyrestrtr:But I don't think ubuntu will go into init 3 and have x serve off at the same time
[06:00] <fyrestrtr> Jim: does the installer get anywhere, or it just refuses to start?
[06:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about acrobat - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:00] <mdeboer> dabaR: which means: understanding how hardware detection works in edgy. i hoped that someone here could tell me that.
[06:00] <Dheeraj_k> ubotu: acrobat
[06:01] <mdeboer> dabaR: as this is something that changed several times in the recent past...

[06:01] <fatsheep> anyone here use the ruby package?  I can't figure out how to get the interpreter working...
[06:01] <fatsheep> I type in "ruby" at the terminal and nothing happens...
[06:01] <fyrestrtr> Jim: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop <-- that will kill X for you
[06:02] <Jim> fyrestrtr: thank you very much
[06:02] <dabaR> fatsheep: aptitude search ruby1.8 shows i on the first letter of that package's line?
[06:02] <fyrestrtr> Jim: open a new console (cltr+alt+f1) login and then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:02] <sysrage> to enable multiverse do i just copy the universe lines in sources.list but change universe to multiverse?
[06:02] <Jim> won't that kill this IRC chatroom too?
[06:02] <fyrestrtr> Jim: what client are you using?
[06:03] <Jim> gaim
[06:03] <dabaR> sysrage: basically, or just add multiverse on the end of the universe line, with a space. You can have them all in one line, see the main restricted line for example.
[06:03] <fyrestrtr> Jim: yes, it will. Use irssi (a text-based IRC client). It should already be installed, but if it isn't, sudo apt-get install irssi should get it for you.
[06:03] <sysrage> dabar: thanks yet again
[06:04] <fatsheep> dabaR: not sure what you mean?
[06:04] <Jim> fyrestrtr: well that was all I needed, thank you very much for your help
[06:04] <dabaR> sysrage: see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34157/ for my sources.list, it has all the official repos with no backports(good:-) with source repos commented out.
[06:04] <fyrestrtr> Jim: then type 'irssi' to start it up, type /con irc.freenode.net to connect to freenode, and /j #ubuntu to get back in here.
[06:04] <Jim> fyrestrtr: okay
[06:04] <fyrestrtr> !source-o-matic
[06:04] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[06:05] <Jim> fyrestrtr: one second
[06:05] <dabaR> fatsheep: what output do you get when you run ruby in a terminal?
[06:05] <fatsheep> dabaR: nothing
[06:05] <fatsheep> I have to ctrl+c to get out of it tho
[06:05] <fatsheep> it just seems to hang and do nothing
[06:05] <dabaR> fatsheep: it hangs on the next line?
[06:05] <fatsheep> yes
[06:06] <m4rk> hi is there any way I can reverse the audio output in ubuntu - make the left channel come out of the right and vice-versa?
[06:06] <dabaR> fatsheep: it is an interpreter, give it commands. sudo aptitude install irb, then run irb, then run print "I sent ruby a command", press enter.
[06:06] <DevC> odd when I do sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox the thing tells me it is the newest version but I can't seem to find it or run it
[06:06] <defrysk> m4rk, switch speakers perhaps ?
[06:06] <Jim> fyrestrtr: can I use that command to get other packages too?
[06:06] <m4rk> defrysk: i meant in software
[06:06] <fyrestrtr> !apt-get | Jim
[06:06] <ubotu> Jim: apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[06:06] <dabaR> DevC: you type in mozilla-firefox in a terminal and it does what?
[06:06] <fatsheep> ok
[06:07] <m4rk> defrysk: i could also just face the other way but it won't really solve my problem ;)
[06:07] <fyrestrtr> DevC: find or run what? firefox?
[06:07] <DevC> yeah
[06:07] <Nemesis2> my swap partition is not being used even though it is on fstab file. How do i make use of my swap ?
[06:07] <Jim> wow thank you so much
[06:07] <DevC> and it just goes to a new prompt line and does nothing
[06:07] <Jim> this is amazing
[06:07] <fyrestrtr> DevC: just type 'firefox' in a terminal
[06:08] <Jim> !dpkg
[06:08] <ubotu> dpkg is the Debian package maintenance system, which together with apt forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit.
[06:08] <DevC> same thing it goes to a new prompt line and does nothing
[06:08] <fatsheep> ah I didn't realize you needed irb for the prompt
[06:08] <sysrage> dabar i used your sources.list but it still says E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-jre
[06:08] <fatsheep> all works well now
[06:08] <fatsheep> thanks
[06:08] <fyrestrtr> Nemesis2: its good its not being used :) You want full use of RAM (RAM is faster than swap). If you swap is being hit a lot, your system will slow down.
[06:09] <dabaR> fatsheep: ;)
[06:09] <dabaR> fatsheep: are you gonna read the talking foxes book?
[06:09] <fyrestrtr> sysrage: sudo apt-get update
[06:09] <sysrage> oh ya i was supposed to do some kinda update
[06:09] <sysrage> that's it.. sorry. dumb mistake
[06:09] <Guardian> how can i mount ntfs raid partitions ???
[06:10] <Jim> again thank you
[06:10] <boink> sun-java5-jre - Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 <= works for me
[06:10] <fyrestrtr> Jim: the wiki has great stuff if you are new to ubuntu. I suggest you browse it.
[06:10] <DevC> fyrestrtr: it just does the same thing goes to new prompt line and then does nothing now browser window no nothing
[06:10] <Nemesis2> fyrestrtr: i remember swap being used before. I have 700 MB of ram. Is this normal swap not being used?
[06:10] <fatsheep> dabaR: talking foxes book?
[06:10] <fyrestrtr> DevC: are you running gnome?
[06:10] <dabaR> fatsheep: ask google:P
[06:10] <Tido|laptop> anyone know what the name of the linux/gnome add-on thingy that adds a quick launcher thingy like you see at the bottom of OSX?
[06:11] <kuja> Does Edgy get setup with a software firewall by default?
[06:11] <fyrestrtr> Nemesis2: yes. Swap is only used when RAM is full and programs ask for RAM, then it 'swaps out' RAM to the disk.
[06:11] <liri> Is it normal then when using cpu frequency scaling I'm seeing only the bogomis change and not the cpu mhz column on /proc/cpuinfo?
[06:11] <candyban> Hi guys
[06:11] <fatsheep> dabaR: k
[06:11] <fyrestrtr> liri: yeah. Install the freq. monitor applet :)
[06:11] <dabaR> fatsheep: actually, google is playing stupid... http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-6.html
[06:11] <Tido|laptop> kuja: edgy should come with iptables I believe
[06:11] <dabaR> fatsheep: don't start with ch 6...
[06:11] <candyban> Does anyone know of problems with edgy when you install mdadm ? I'm unable to boot since I installed it
[06:11] <ubuntu_> hello everybody
[06:12] <dabaR> hey, it's Ubuntu
[06:12] <FFForever> i have kubuntu installed how do i install gnome?
[06:12] <naitmer> !ubotu webcam
[06:12] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[06:12] <fyrestrtr> FFForever: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[06:12] <liri> frying_fish: I do have it, just double checking. I'm on 2.6.15-27-686 SMP kernel right now but when I was on 2.6.15-22-386 then I *did* saw the cpu mhz change from 1666 to 2700 or something...
[06:12] <FFForever> i dont use sudo its so annoying lol
[06:12] <FFForever> :)
[06:12] <FFForever> su - :)
[06:12] <liri> frying_fish: so you're saying if the bogomips alone change then that's enough to be sure that cpu scaling is working?
[06:13] <DevC> yeah i'm running gnome
[06:13] <bluefox83> FFForever, sudo -s
[06:13] <fyrestrtr> DevC: what's wrong with the firefox that came with ubuntu?
[06:13] <candyban> Does anyone know how to make their system bootable again after edge has broken it?
[06:13] <dabaR> candyban: http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=mdadm+edgy&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
[06:13] <fyrestrtr> FFForever: sudo -i
[06:13] <FFForever> su - is fater and less typing :)
[06:13] <fyrestrtr> FFForever: oh well, its your system :)
[06:14] <dabaR> candyban: well, what you could do is boot live, chroot old, and remove mdamd...:-/
[06:14] <bluefox83> candyban, what the heck is mdadm?
[06:14] <liri> fyrestrtr:  so you're saying if the bogomips alone change then that's enough to be sure that cpu scaling is working?
[06:14] <dabaR> FFForever: ya, fatrer
[06:14] <boink> you can sudo su
[06:14] <fyrestrtr> yes, I believe so.
[06:15] <lmh> Xorg won't start after perfectly working desktop installation
[06:15] <DevC> fyrestrtr: nothing but I"m upgrading from 5.04 to 5.10 to 6.06 to 6.10 but the first thing it says to do 'sudo apt-get remove firefox mozilla-firefox' and then do 'sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox'
[06:15] <lmh> anybody an idea?
[06:15] <liri> Ok thanks.
[06:15] <ryurhrt> driver problem
[06:15] <dabaR> lmh: you tried sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start? what graphs card do you have?
[06:15] <bluefox83> candyban, my guess would be that all you need to do is chroot in and update grub...since mdadm is a device manager
[06:16] <lmh> dabaR: have a Matrox G550
[06:16] <candyban> dabaR: the only thing I have left here is an old knoppix cd (3.3) which says "KERNEL: TOO OLD" when I try to chroot to my old environemtn
[06:16] <candyban> dabaR: The thing is that my root filesystem isn't even on the raid partition ...
[06:16] <lmh> dabaR: yes, says Start ok, but screen stays black
[06:17] <shwag> so does anyone know how to get ehci loaded so I can use my usb devices high speed ?
[06:17] <lmh> dabaR: LCD switches off, on, off, on, etc.
[06:17] <lmh> dabaR: (SleepMode)
[06:17] <sig_> hey anyone know how to find what channels a user is in?
[06:17] <bluefox83> shwag, i would guess all you need to do is swap them out in synaptic
[06:17] <candyban> bluefox83: mdadm is a tool to create and manage software raid
[06:17] <fyrestrtr> sig_: /whois nickname
[06:17] <bungle> hi
[06:17] <sig_> frying_fish: it isn't showing channels though
[06:17] <bungle> testing bitchx :p
[06:17] <sig_> fyrestrtr:
[06:17] <bluefox83> candyban, yes, i saw that...just update grub for starters
[06:18] <sig_> fyrestrtr: it isn't showing channels though
[06:18] <sig_> hmm
[06:18] <Jeej> Hello
[06:18] <shwag> bluefox83: the modules are on the system. they need to be loaded.
[06:18] <bluefox83> shwag, sudo modprobe <module>
=== sig_ is now known as sig_laptop
[06:18] <dabaR> frying_fish: wake up man
[06:18] <jchillerup> Hi. Is it possible to apt-get my kernel-headers?
[06:19] <dasholzbein> fyrestrtr: rhythmbox works great now. Thanks for your hint :-)
[06:19] <bluefox83> jchillerup, yes
[06:19] <jchillerup> I'm using a 2.6-kernel
[06:19] <shwag> bluefox83: with ehci loaded...the bus is still being run by uhci
[06:19] <jchillerup> the package `kernel-headers' only gives me 2.4-kernels to chose from
[06:19] <jchillerup> choose
[06:19] <shwag> bluefox83: unplugging the device does nothing because it is the bus that is using the driver.
[06:19] <liri> after removing the 2.6.15-27-386 package it left me with no /vmlinuz but a /vmlinuz.old which points to boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-27-686, is this ok or am I into trouble with grub?
[06:19] <bungle> can anyone help me on installing nvidia drivers?
[06:19] <dabaR> jchillerup: try that one...
[06:19] <jchillerup> dabaR, that doesn't make sense.
[06:19] <dabaR> ok
[06:20] <jchillerup> What would I use kernel headers for 2.4 for when I'm using 2.6?
[06:20] <bluefox83> shwag, kill the bus, unload the module (sudo modprobe -r module) and restart the bus?
[06:20] <shwag> bluefox83: if I do that...i lose my usb keyboard and mouse.
[06:20] <dabaR> jchillerup: did you check your sources.list?
=== sig_laptop is now known as sig
[06:20] <jchillerup> dabaR, no
[06:20] <masterninja> whats the command to open a folder in the terminal?
[06:20] <jchillerup> Hell, I'll just compile a kernel instead
[06:20] <bluefox83> shwag, do it all in one command so you wont have to lose anything
[06:20] <Jeej> Does anybody know where i can find ubuntu 4.10 Warty Warthog documentation?
[06:21] <bungle> cd /foldername/
[06:21] <dabaR> masterninja: in nautilus or do you mean cd?
[06:21] <shwag> bluefox83: i tried that...but the keyboard didnt reload.
[06:21] <bungle> orion2012: nautilus /folder
[06:21] <mcquaid> hello, i was looking for a classic looney tunes and found it here, but it doesn't play.  I'm currently using the totem plugin, not sure if switching to the mplayer plugin will give me better luck
[06:21] <masterninja> cd
[06:21] <shwag> bluefox83: i did   rmmod uhci; modprobe ehci;   but the keyboard and mouse never came back.
[06:21] <DevC> when I did the two sudos that the official upgrade site said to do I suddenly lost my ability to use the browser even though it says I have the latest version installed
[06:21] <mcquaid> can anyone try this link to see if the toon views?
[06:21] <mcquaid> http://www.alfy.com/cool_stuff/cartoons/watch_free_cartoons.aspx?VideoID=1168
[06:21] <masterninja> i wanna open a folder through the terminal
[06:21] <bluefox83> shwag, forget to add a modprobe for the keyboard module?
[06:21] <candyban> Is the ubuntu kernel (edgy) able to boot an XFS partition from hda (sata) without initrd?
[06:22] <bungle> use cd masterninja
[06:22] <candyban> Or can I force the kernel not to execute the "init" on the initrd partition?
[06:22] <bungle> ls to list files in current folder
[06:22] <masterninja> thats change directory
[06:22] <dabaR> masterninja: would you already be in a terminal?
[06:22] <masterninja> yes
[06:22] <dabaR> and open in in what program?
[06:23] <masterninja> folder viewer
[06:23] <shwag> bluefox83: well..if that does work...then how would I get it to do that everytime at bootup?
[06:23] <bungle> nautilus /foldername
[06:23] <bungle> e.g.: nautilus /home/eddy/
[06:23] <masterninja> i have gnome
[06:23] <masterninja> oh right
[06:23] <bluefox83> shwag, i don't think you would need to...when you boot up it will start up the usb handlers, which will poll the ports automatically and load the correct drivers for you
[06:23] <sits> hi. Does anyone know of a way to get bash to do zsh style glob completion when pressing tab?
[06:24] <Morrissey> Can anyone tell my my CPU goes from 4% to 60% (!!) just open amarok (not even playing)
[06:24] <shwag> bluefox83: well in that case...how come its not doing that already ?
[06:24] <synic> Morrissey: what about just idling?
[06:24] <shwag> bluefox83: because the system used uhci
[06:24] <sits> Morrissey: even loading libraries takes CPU
[06:24] <bluefox83> shwag, no idea :X
=== [\]  is now known as Saais
[06:25] <sits> bluefox83: linux generally doesn't poll for devices
[06:25] <Morrissey> sits, synic: What do you mean?
[06:25] <ayy> hello
[06:25] <Morrissey> sits, synic: even 10 minutes after open amarok, wich doesnt play anything, my CPU goes crazy
[06:25] <synic> Morrissey: it might be that fancy graphic at the bottom
[06:25] <Morrissey> synic, ah
[06:25] <stojance> What's Ubuntu Open Week?
[06:25] <anto> Can somone help me enter my NFTS partiton for windows because when i write sudo fdisk -l it displays it but i don't know how to create a folder to browse it.
[06:25] <synic> Morrissey: do you use gnome or KDE?
[06:25] <bungle> masterninja to open a folder as root: gksudo nautilus /folder
[06:25] <sits> bluefox83: for most devices these days when the device is added it generates a "I'm here" event
[06:25] <dabaR> stojance: an event to take over the world;-)
[06:26] <bluefox83> sits, no, but the usb device thingy does...
[06:26] <shwag> bluefox83: is an intel 82801BA/BAM   usb1 or usb2 ?
[06:26] <tim167> how can I set all Links in gnome to open at single click (to open a file with single click for example) ?
[06:26] <bluefox83> shwag, i have no idea >.>
[06:26] <Morrissey> synic, kde
[06:26] <sits> bluefox83: blimey. OK, I was sure it was all handled by udev
[06:26] <mcquaid> can anyone using the mplayer plugin for ff try a link to see if the vid plays?

[06:27] <synic> Morrissey: ah, I was gonna plug a gnome alternative, but nm :)
[06:27] <dope> i have an AMD Turion 64 x2.  should i install the 64-bit version of ubuntu?
[06:27] <Morrissey> synic, and actually :) Disabling that fancy graphic actually improved perfomance :)
[06:27] <fallingdutch> what does need to be in the deb-package so the binary will be displayed in the menu?
[06:27] <mcquaid> http://www.alfy.com/cool_stuff/cartoons/watch_free_cartoons.aspx?VideoID=1168
[06:27] <bluefox83> sits, yeah, udeb or something...i think it's something different for usb...my memory sucks -_-
[06:27] <bluefox83> *udev
[06:27] <dope>  i have an AMD Turion 64 x2.  should i install the 64-bit version of ubuntu?
[06:27] <Storkme> how come if i use a command to mount a samba fs it works fine but if i put it in /etc/fstab it gives me an error when i log in to X... the error is 'unable to initialize HAL!'

[06:29] <masterninja> i got a laptop as well we must be brothers
[06:29] <kudzubane> dope: you could
[06:29] <Morrissey> synic, what gnome alternative's that?
[06:29] <synic> dope: I'd stick with 32bit then, you'll probably like it more.  There are some desktop uses which aren't really available for 64bit.
[06:29] <kudzubane> dope: or your could install the 32-bit, you have a choice
[06:29] <dope> would it be better to put the 64 bit version on here?
[06:29] <synic> dope: IE, flash, win32 codecs
[06:30] <dope> oh
[06:30] <synic> Morrissey: http://www.exaile.org
[06:30] <dope> so go with the 32bit then
[06:30] <shwag> bluefox83: if you lsmod, do you have ehci or uhci ?
[06:30] <synic> dope: I would... I used 64bit for about 6 months at which point I couldn't stand it anymore :)
[06:31] <idj> why not, synic?
[06:31] <Morrissey> synic, thats no eyecandy though :)
[06:31] <dope> ok thx for the advice
[06:31] <dabaR> gpafixit ls -l /home/gpafixit/directory, see whether they all have x permission enabled
[06:31] <synic> idj: because it was a pain to use 32bit binaries

[06:42] <abo> user__ you need to use realplayer to run rm

[06:42] <user__> abo, mplayer works
[06:42] <deluge> i am trying to set up dual heads.. i got to the part where i edit my xorg.conf.. but the file is empty!
[06:42] <user__> abo, why totem not?
[06:42] <graham_100> can someone help me here please?
[06:43] <Arigato> is there a good C/C++ IDE which includes a good compiler and debugger preferably with code formatting?
[06:43] <deluge> actually im just doing the binary driver install
[06:43] <abo> user__, it's weird I'm helping you out, and I've been struggling with this since ages and still couldn't make it to work on mine... I have no idea
[06:43] <ah> last try, can anybody please help me to configure an 9230tx 32 enet-card? it works (i'm online with it) but very very very slow, onboard is much faster, what could be wrong!?
[06:43] <abo> Arigato, anjuta and kdevelop
[06:44] <compengi> with using wget command wget -o is to resume the download right?
[06:44] <gpafixit> I'm sorry, I accidentally logged out just as I was reading an answer to my last question .. When I right click a file and look at it, it says it is supposed to open with AbiWord, but instead it tries to open it as an executable file .. .rtf format even shows as rich text .. can I fix this?
[06:44] <abo> Arigato, they do not include the compiler/debugger, they rely on gcc being installed
[06:44] <graham_100> hello???
[06:44] <klees> what's the best console mail program???
[06:44] <compengi> klees, evolution mail
[06:44] <graham_100> is opera web browser better than mozilla firefox?
[06:45] <gpafixit> no
[06:45] <Music_Shuffle> They're about equal.
[06:45] <klees> compengi: does thunderbird support console?
[06:45] <abo> Arigato, your name is a japanese word?
[06:45] <graham_100> no point in changing that then
[06:45] <compengi> graham_100, firefox is more popular
[06:45] <graham_100> how do i change to mozilla firefox 2?
[06:45] <abo> graham_100, it's lighter, I can't seem to run opera on ubuntu.. it never worked :-(
[06:46] <graham_100> i think i will stick to firefox
[06:46] <user__> i'm running edgy with the latest firefox however my Firefox fonts suck, how can I fix them?
[06:46] <graham_100> i have 1.5 but i wanted to try 2 how do you do it?
[06:46] <compengi> klees, i don't know never got interested in that region
[06:46] <klees> ok
[06:46] <gpafixit> compengi: you have to update your repositories ..
[06:46] <graham_100> my firefox fonts are rubbish too on ubuntu 6.06
[06:47] <dabaR> graham_100: you can try both, each is better
[06:47] <Dheeraj_k> why vim does not reflect function in different colour? on ubuntu
[06:47] <Dheeraj_k> : it display every thing black and white
[06:47] <compengi> graham_100, in edgy (6.10) firefox is 2.0 :)
[06:47] <drach> Dheeraj_k: syntax on
[06:47] <graham_100> can i get 2.0 in 6.06?
[06:48] <Dheeraj_k> how can i fix this problem?

[06:50] <m4rk> hi is there any way I can reverse the audio output in ubuntu - make the left channel come out of the right and vice-versa?
[06:50] <graham_100> how do i format a hard drive in ubuntu??
[06:51] <DevC> I'd assume /usr/bin/ but I may be wrong....if I run them I can't seem to get them to open up for some odd reason
[06:52] <Lynoure> graham_100: depends on what filesystem you want on it
[06:52] <nolimitsoya> !gparted | graham_100
[06:52] <ubotu> graham_100: gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[06:52] <graham_100> lynoure i don't understand
[06:53] <Lynoure> graham_100: what do you want to use it in, after formatting?
[06:53] <graham_100> ubotu what is that for?
=== ubuntu is now known as Dreamglider
[06:53] <Lynoure> graham_100: in Linux, MS windows, something else? or do you want it safely emptied?
[06:53] <DevC> graham_100: do you mean just to format it to make space or to change OSes for it?
[06:53] <graham_100> lynoure in this machine running ubuntu 6.06 for music and other files
[06:53] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, ubotu is a bot. ask me, since i invoked the bot ;) gparted is (as ubotu said) a gui program for partitioning and formating
[06:54] <graham_100> devc i want to use it for a second drive on this linux system
[06:54] <see> anybody has gotten sound to work on a macpro?
[06:55] <Lynoure> graham_100: mkfs.ext3 is the command I'd use, but there is probably some cute graphical way, too
[06:55] <nolimitsoya> Lynoure, i just gave him one ;)
[06:55] <Lynoure> nolimitsoya: oh, I did not see it on the channel
[06:55] <Dreamglider> it takes forever to install 6.10
[06:55] <wceoscar> HEy, im trying to install ubuntu with the manual edit partition table... i have a 80gig hdd and going to install both ubuntu and winxp.. what type of partition  should i make???
[06:55] <nolimitsoya> 18:52:39
[06:56] <nolimitsoya> Lynoure,
[06:56] <DevC> you saying that reminded me that i have an old 4 gig hdd on this pc along with this current 60 gig ubuntu is on.....got to get back into programming lol.....but now I understand what you mean...you want to format the second HDD to make it a second drive for ubuntu?
[06:56] <graham_100> lynoure i don't know how to do that as i have only just started using this o/s
[06:56] <blake_> Does anyone know how to pirate windows?
[06:56] <DevC> blake_: wrong channel
[06:56] <graham_100> blake_ no why would you want to it's rubbish
[06:56] <wceoscar> you saying that reminded me that i have an old 4 gig hdd on this pc along with this current 60 gig ubuntu is on.....got to get back into programming lol.....but now I understand what you mean...you want to format the second HDD to make it a second drive for ubuntu?
[06:57] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, just do use gparted, as i told you. type 'sudo apt-get install gparted' in a terminal, and then run gparted
[06:57] <xamox> I setup ubuntu to run as a NAS, what torrent software does everyone recommend? I would like something to run as a service and maybe connect to it via internet browser?
[06:57] <Lynoure> graham_100: nolimitsoya said she gave you some advice on that. Her way is probably easier than mine
[06:57] <DevC> wceoscar: huh?
[06:57] <blake_> graham_100 cuz i get shit loads of errors using wine. i just would rather use it for gaming yah know. do u know how to?
[06:57] <wceoscar> HEy, im trying to install ubuntu with the manual edit partition table... i have a 80gig hdd and going to install both ubuntu and winxp.. what type of partition  should i make???
[06:57] <graham_100> lynoure ok thanks
[06:57] <Lynoure> oops, his
[06:57] <blake_> DevC what channel would i go for. for that?
[06:57] <wceoscar> HEy, im trying to install ubuntu with the manual edit partition table... i have a 80gig hdd and going to install both ubuntu and winxp.. what type of partition  should i make???
[06:57] <graham_100> nolimitsoya how do i do that again?
[06:57] <DevC> graham_100: windows sucks but most colleges use it for their courses
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> wceoscar, any type you want
[06:58] <apokryphos> wceoscar: no repeating please
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> graham_100, i just told you. scroll up
[06:58] <gu014> when i load firefox nothing happens and i notice there is a very small firefox window(extremely minimized) and when i close that my firefox loads....any ideas?
[06:58] <graham_100> nolimitsoya ok sorry
[06:58] <DevC> blake_: a warez or such channel, this channel is specifically ubuntu and we don't handle pirating software
[06:58] <wceoscar> yes i know... but how many partitions should i make???? 1 for root 1 for boot?
[06:58] <wceoscar> what else?
[06:59] <apokryphos> wceoscar: no, one for root, one for /home, and leave the one for windows
[06:59] <wceoscar> what about boot and the other stuff?
[07:00] <apokryphos> wceoscar: you don't really need to have them on seperate partitions, but if you really want you can have /boot on one
[07:00] <wceoscar> ok
[07:00] <hoelk_> having /home on a seperate partition is quite usefull :)
[07:00] <wceoscar> so give me a recomended size for /root and for /home
[07:00] <apokryphos> precisely. The others aren't so important.
[07:01] <see> anybody has gotten sound to work on a macpro, everything seems to be working, no errors, but there is no sound out?
[07:01] <apokryphos> wceoscar: no, not /root, but / (root partition).
[07:01] <apokryphos> wceoscar: I'd have around 10 gigs for /, anything else you can spare for /home
[07:01] <wceoscar> ok... but what would be a good amount of space for installing all source of stuff???
[07:01] <apokryphos> ?
[07:02] <wceoscar> i currentlu have an 80gig
[07:02] <apokryphos> "install all source of stuff"??
[07:02] <wceoscar> will 10 gigs be sufficient?? what about /home... i need a good amount of space
[07:03] <apokryphos> for / 10 gigs is good, yes
[07:03] <apokryphos> for /home -- put everything else you can spare. Depends on how much space you want windows to have
[07:03] <graham_100> nolimitsoya i can't find where i need to be with this
[07:03] <we2by> some how gnome is not saving its settings

[07:03] <wceoscar> can i set 15gigs for /home or will something smaller do the job?
[07:04] <wceoscar> also can i resize partitions once the distro is installed?
[07:04] <apokryphos> wceoscar: 15 gigs is good. It's a shame you're wasting so much space on windows though :P
[07:04] <wceoscar> 15 is good or something more?
[07:04] <DevC> trying to remove firefox and reinstall it again
[07:04] <apokryphos> wceoscar: you can but partition is never completely guaranteed, unfortunately.
[07:04] <PaveH> Any ideas why modprobe acer_acpi gives a fatal error (..../acer_acpi.ko) No such device?
[07:04] <seraphim> wceoscar: the size depends on how much data you will have ;)
[07:04] <apokryphos> wceoscar: 70 is good :P

[07:07] <apokryphos> we2by: reinstall?
[07:07] <we2by> apokryphos, don't want to reinstall
[07:07] <Lynoure> we2by: recovery boot in
[07:07] <we2by> I can fix it with single mode boot
[07:07] <we2by> but I want to fix it without rebooting

[07:07] <jbroome> err, [no] 
=== sheepasauras is now known as bah
[07:08] <wceoscar> HEY. what about swap space???? do i need to make a partition for it?
[07:08] <apokryphos> wceoscar: 1 gig is good
[07:08] <Lynoure> we2by: why? A bit hard if you messed it so that you cannot sudo.
[07:08] <we2by> the permissions are all screwed up
[07:08] <jbroome> wceoscar: the gdm theme install not go well last night?
[07:08] <apokryphos> you almost definitely can't fix your sudo without booting, unless you already set up
[07:08] <apokryphos> *set up su
[07:09] <wceoscar> ok so thats / 10gig /home 15gig /swap 1gig =26gig is this ok?
[07:09] <we2by> what the heck, I'm gonna reinstall it tomorow then
[07:09] <Lynoure> we2by: yes, but why do you need to fix it without booting?
[07:09] <apokryphos> wceoscar: 15 gigs for /, 1 gig for swap, yeah
[07:09] <seraphim> wceoscar: you don't need so much for / . 7 should be more than enough already
[07:09] <Suspectator> Does anyone know how I can get ubuntu edgy to sort files and folders the old way, putting folders on top sorted alphabetically and then doing files alphabetically? Also does anyone know how to make the default folder size bigger (Every time I open a folder the window resizes smaller again)?
[07:09] <Lynoure> we2by: you do not probably need to reinstall
[07:09] <we2by> there is more than sudo

[07:11] <apokryphos> but I agree, I'd say the vast majority of users would be good with 7/8
[07:11] <arao> nope :p
[07:11] <wceoscar> whats the avg for /home...
[07:11] <arao> lol
[07:11] <apokryphos> wceoscar: there is no average. It depends on what things you're going to have
[07:11] <jbroome> we2by: mine is 351 GB

[07:11] <jbroome> crap

[07:11] <Lynoure> we2by: I'd fix it with a livecd and some shell scripting, it might even turn out to be fun to fix.
[07:11] <arao> i wanna join the drive
[07:11] <Suspectator> Ah never mind, I got it to "sort folders before files"
[07:11] <jbroome> wceoscar: mine is 351 gb. :P
[07:12] <wceoscar> i have a fileserver for music

[07:14] <we2by> Lynoure, i think reinstall is the fastest solution
[07:14] <cmweb> but not the files
[07:15] <we2by> but I'm afraid I will have to spend a few hours to get it back to this state
[07:15] <jbroome> we2by: if you want to get it back to the state it's in now, just chown / as your user again
[07:15] <wceoscar> anyways... ill go with 15 for /home... if i need more space will i be able to resize?
[07:15] <timo90> we2by: my biggest fear

[07:16] <Grey_Loki> soundray, I think so, yes.

[07:16] <soundray> Grey_Loki: do you get any output from 'sudo modprobe nvidia'?
[07:16] <jbroome> we2by: i'd say the state it's in now is FUBAR
[07:16] <Grey_Loki> Let me check - I performed an update with the synaptic tool before starting, and it said something about installing restricted packages.
[07:17] <wceoscar> anyways ill go with 15gb for /home iff i fill the partition... will i be able to resize it or create a new one?
[07:17] <soundray> Grey_Loki: 'dpkg -l linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)' should tell you
[07:17] <Grey_Loki> soundray, output from that command - 'Not loading nvidia module; not used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf'

[07:19] <arao> timo: will try
[07:19] <soundray> Grey_Loki: that looks fine (the 'ii' means the package is installed)
[07:19] <Grey_Loki> Right
[07:19] <Grey_Loki> So my course of action is to edit xorg.conf?
[07:19] <einPaule> Hi everybody, I just tried emacs and xemacs for the first time and I'm wondering if there's a way to make them look better
[07:19] <arao> kitche: any place to start with ?
[07:20] <soundray> Grey_Loki: normally, the nvidia-config step should have done it for you
[07:20] <kitche> arao: you don't know the ip to your router? is it your modem also?
[07:20] <arao> yes
[07:20] <Grey_Loki> soundray, the nvidia-config step mentions something about installing drivers.
[07:20] <arao> kitche: its actually a modem i use to dial in
[07:20] <Grey_Loki> soundray, let me just run the appropriate command again, so you get the exact text.
[07:20] <decode> question wats the next version after edgy?
[07:21] <kitche> arao: the ip of your modem might be 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.1.1 for example my dsl modem I have my own password on it even though it's from verzion
[07:21] <Grey_Loki> soundray, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34179/

[07:22] <Lynoure> decode: feisty
[07:22] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, you might try alsaconfig in the terminal.
[07:22] <Grey_Loki> Uhm
[07:22] <arao> timo: no doc for linux... as usual
[07:22] <soundray> Grey_Loki: does nvidia.ko appear in "ls /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/"?
[07:22] <Grey_Loki> alsamixer, sorry.
[07:22] <kitche> arao: most likely then it has ethernet over usb, but read the manual for your modem to figure out whta ip it has
[07:23] <Morrissey> how Can I record my current desktop? So I can make a movie about it :) ie: using beryl, showing off stuff +++ ... ?

[07:23] <kandinski> I am installing a Centrino laptop, do I use linux-686, linux-image-686 or some othr opttion?
[07:23] <r_> well I mean everything is working fine except for that, all the effects are working great
[07:23] <arao> kitche: okie
[07:23] <Morrissey> thanks soundray
[07:23] <__doc__> Grey_Loki: alsamixer seems to do the job
[07:23] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, good :)
[07:24] <soundray> Grey_Loki: I think a reboot will help. That should put nvidia.ko in the directory.
[07:24] <we2by> what the heck, gonna fix my ubuntu :)
[07:24] <we2by> fun!
[07:24] <Grey_Loki> soundray, righto. I'll reboot and let you know how things go. Back in a bit :P
[07:24] <__doc__> Grey_Loki: though it's funny why this doesn't link in with the tray mixer isn't it?
[07:24] <ScislaC> Is there a way to manually remove an item from the "installed packages" list? It's telling me to reinstall something but no method of forcing it will work.
[07:24] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, I can't say - i'm not much of a linux guru :P
[07:24] <decode> has feisty come out yet so i cna manual update?

[07:26] <jbroome> Dheeraj_k: i don't want kde on linux, much less windows. :)
[07:26] <timo90> r_: yes
[07:27] <Grey_Loki> soundray, very stupidly, I forgot to note the directory you mentioned. What was it again, please?
[07:27] <soundray> Grey_Loki: does nvidia.ko appear in "ls /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/"?
[07:27] <ScislaC> soundray: it's submitting... 1 sec
[07:27] <Grey_Loki> soundray, no.
[07:28] <Grey_Loki> The directory is still completely empty.

[07:29] <kandinski> what is the difference between linux-686 and linux-image-686?
[07:29] <r_> timo90 could you please tell me how :)
[07:30] <timo90> shure
[07:30] <soundray> kandinski: "apt-cache show linux-686 linux-image-686" will tell you
[07:30] <kandinski> soundray, not when I am in the installer ;)
[07:30] <kandinski> no apt-cache available there
[07:30] <soundray> Grey_Loki: I think you may have a version mismatch between the kernel and the restricted modules.
[07:30] <edwardsNdallasTX> anyone setup up RAID5 on a LAMP installation?
[07:31] <vagamente> hi all... ne1 can help me with compiz?
[07:31] <Grey_Loki> soundray, so I need to uninstall the restricted modules, and install the correct version?

[07:31] <gu014> edwardsNdallasTX, yes
[07:32] <qos> i have a simple problem... my installed ubuntu on my windows machine, but i think grub was installed on the other harddrive ... how to fix this problem?

[07:32] <TheGateKeeper>  Seveas if as you say samba is not installed by default why has /etc/samba/smb.conf full of config info?

[07:33] <soundray> ScislaC: have you done anything with the sources.list lately?
[07:33] <dan-erik> doc: americas army =)
[07:33] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, the linux port of the America's Army game is very fun.
[07:33] <timo90> if its not responding berly that is give it time,
[07:33] <dan-erik> :)
[07:33] <qos> nobody knows how to change the location of grub?
[07:33] <__doc__> dan-erik: has americas army gotten it's netcoding down right?
[07:33] <kitche> Grey_Loki: didn't they stop the port?
[07:34] <Grey_Loki> kitche, not as far as I know - I haven't checked the site for a while though.
[07:34] <soundray> Grey_Loki: yeah, 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)' and a reboot should sort it out.
[07:34] <r_> no its ight?
[07:34] <r_> -:- SignOff spacey_: #ubuntu (Remote closed the connection)
[07:34] <Lynoure> qos: more detail, please, otherwise it's just "google grub howto"  :)
[07:34] <__doc__> dan-erik: last time I checked (about 2 years back) their netcode sucked arse (wonder how it could've gotten any worse then the unreal-engine default, but hey, it's a govermental project after all... :)
[07:34] <dan-erik> doc: netcoding? I have no idea what you're talking about. but I play it online. not upgraded for the last 2 updates though, so the windows version is much more complete and updated. still very fun and a very good game though
[07:35] <r_> sry typo, but the window just dissappears when i try to open it
[07:35] <Grey_Loki> soundray, and from there I just run the nvidia-config command, and carry on as planned?
[07:35] <Morrissey> soundray, does it work with kde as well? I press the red button .. Dont know if it records .. then I press it again (After a looong time the icon dissaperas)
[07:35] <gu014> edwardsNdallasTX, well, some would tell you to use the default config

[07:36] <naitmer> hello
[07:36] <timo90> r_: so what are you trying to do by changing the log in window (it only deals with apperance)
[07:36] <ScislaC> soundray: well, I added a repo that had a bad wpasupplicant package... but when I try to uninstall/reinstall that message is what I get. As soon as I can get it off my system I just want to reinstall that package with the official one (and obviously remove that repo from my sources.list).
[07:37] <finalbeta> Jager, http://www.macewan.org/2006/06/01/howto-firefox-flash-video-sound-on-ubuntu-linux-dapper/
[07:37] <soundray> Grey_Loki: you aren't running the 386 kernel, though, but the generic one.
[07:37] <kitche> qos: is /dev/hdb your boot device?
[07:37] <dv5237> Jager: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-c268ba69c6b38af1dc31ea09701c7d296cf971c3 << read the sound part
[07:37] <Grey_Loki> soundray, sorry, I don't quite understand :(
[07:37] <qos> kitche: no, /dev/sda is my boot device
[07:37] <bluefox83> how do i tell ubuntu what media player i want to use?
[07:37] <r_> yes exactly the old one was much nicer, im just doing it for the cosmetics
[07:37] <Jager> Thanks
[07:37] <kitche> qos: /dev/hdb has to be your boot device if you install grub there
[07:37] <vagamente> ne1 can help me with compiz?

[07:38] <EDinNY> I just installed ubuntu and I am having problems using rsync via ssh to restore my old /home directory...it says "rsync: on remote machine: --no-specials: unknown option"
[07:38] <__doc__> any good RTS for linux?
[07:38] <Bond_> hi world!
[07:38] <kitche> __doc__: plenty warzone 2100 ::)
[07:38] <timo90> try and restart berl
[07:38] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, I think the TASpring project might have a linux port, too.
[07:38] <Bond_> anybody help me with debian instalg?
[07:38] <soundray> Grey_Loki: check the version of your running kernel with 'uname -r'. You will see that it's not 2.6.17-10-386 (which would match your modules), but 2.6.17-10-generic (which is the restricted modules version that you need).
[07:38] <Bond_> install
[07:38] <EDinNY> anyone an rsync guru?
[07:38] <dan-erik> __doc__: other good games: wesnoth (not very good graphics though IMO), SuperTux (if you like supermario), freeciv (same comment as wesnoth), Wormux (no net, but multiplayer. some bugs)
[07:38] <EDinNY> or can give help with rsync
[07:38] <soundray> !anyone | EDinNY
[07:39] <ubotu> EDinNY: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[07:39] <shwag> its a bit confusing that /var/log/messages shows "new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd."  It can tell that the device is full speed, but it is using uhci...which is the non high speed driver.
[07:39] <r_> ive tried that
[07:39] <Grey_Loki> soundray, uname -r gives me '2.6.17-10-386'
[07:39] <jbroome> EDinNY: is ssh/rsync installed on your new ubuntu install
[07:39] <EDinNY> yes
[07:39] <shwag> Maybe it would be easier to understand if it mentioned that the device is running at a lower rater because the bus doesnt support usb2.
[07:39] <EDinNY> jbroome: yes
[07:39] <__doc__> Grey_Loki: TASpring doesn't seem to have a linux port.
[07:40] <Grey_Loki> __doc__, ah, my bad. Thought it did - sorry.
[07:40] <soundray> Grey_Loki: I'm sorry, I see now that I misread your earlier dpkg -l pasting
[07:40] <Bond_> hey
[07:40] <EDinNY> jbroome: I can ssh to my backup machine, then ssh back to the new ubuntu machine
[07:40] <jbroome> EDinNY: pastebin the full rsync command you're trying to use
[07:40] <jbroome> plz
[07:40] <dan-erik> __doc__: try looking for posts by "Artificial Intelligence" on ubuntuforums.org - he has several good gaming links in his sig
[07:40] <EDinNY> jbroome: so I know that sshd is running on ubuntu
[07:41] <ScislaC> soundray: any ideas?
[07:41] <jbroome> i have a feeling you're passing a wonky --option
[07:41] <soop> fyi: gnome-display-properties
[07:41] <Grey_Loki> soundray, i've just gone back and looked at it myself - am I reading it right if I think that i'm running three different kernels?
[07:41] <r_> i  sudo aptitude reinstall usplash-theme-ubuntu
[07:41] <soop> anyone care to tell me why my movie files are now playing like sh*t and I get an error about xvid whenever I launch them?
[07:41] <r_> i also tried that didnt work
[07:42] <EDinNY> how do I paste multiple lines here without getting complaints?
[07:42] <soundray> ScislaC: check if you have an official wpasupplicant version in /var/cache/apt/archives and install it with 'dpkg -i --force-downgrade wpasupplicant...deb'
[07:42] <Enselic> Is there any software that allowd me to simulate a cd? I have a .iso I'd like to install, but I dont have any cd-r:s

[07:42] <MBro> does anyone know how to stop hotplug from running?
[07:42] <MBro> i'm trying to reformat a usb disk
[07:42] <MBro> and it keeps mounting in the middle of formatting it
[07:42] <MBro> so it stops the format
[07:43] <ScislaC> soundray: it only has the bad package in the cache
[07:43] <soundray> Grey_Loki: no, you have three installed, but you only ever run the one you select in the grub menu.
[07:43] <Enselic> MBro: System -> Preferences -> mountable media or something
[07:43] <jbroome> EDinNY: check this out:  http://lists.samba.org/archive/rsync/2006-May/015503.html
[07:43] <Grey_Loki> soundray, right. Well, i'm selecting the *-386 version. Should I stop that, and return to using the generic kernel?
[07:43] <MBro> ah
[07:43] <MBro> thanks
[07:44] <soundray> ScislaC: download the official package from http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/w/wpasupplicant/
[07:44] <soop> Enselic: try mounting the iso
[07:44] <Enselic> soop: Wont the isntallation program freak out then?
[07:44] <soop> mount -t iso9660  or something like that
[07:44] <omong_kosong> which programm should be used to listen to internet radio streams?
[07:44] <soop> Enselic: what are you trying to install of a cd?
[07:44] <soundray> Grey_Loki: you could. There is no advantage to the 386 kernel anyway. Whether it will fix the problem is another matter.
[07:44] <Enselic> soop: A Maple student version
[07:44] <soop> when you insert the cd it should automount anyways
[07:44] <Grey_Loki> soundray, indeed.
[07:44] <soop> maple student version? wtf is that?>
[07:45] <r_>  sudo aptitude reinstall usplash-theme-ubuntu
[07:45] <Enselic> soop: wikipedia maple
[07:45] <Grey_Loki> soundray, do you know what the problem -is-, exactly? I'm guessing it's something to do with my installation of the restricted modules...
[07:45] <emilia> hey guys, im using edgy, and when i plug in my camera, or my usb drive, its not detected? anyone want to help me?
[07:45] <EDinNY> jbroome: Thanks!  I was using an old rsync script with some extra not needed lines! good day
[07:45] <soop> emilia: are they turned on? are you sure your ports that you're plugging into are connected? Have you tried a different usb port?
[07:45] <Morrissey> soundray, cant it record faster then 10frames/sec :)
[07:46] <emilia> soop: well my mouse works
[07:46] <emilia> soop: and yes
[07:46] <soop> well ok, so your mouse' usb port is working
[07:46] <MBro> hurray, it worked, thanks Enselic
[07:46] <soop> plug your mouse into one of the ports your trying and plug your camera into the other
[07:46] <soundray> Grey_Loki: normally, the nvidia kernel is generated dynamically in the volatile directory. For some reason that doesn't happen, although the package is installed. I think booting another kernel is a reasonable thing to try.
[07:46] <soop> make sure camera is on b4 plugging in and see what happens
[07:46] <sysrage> anybody here use sylpheed-claws?
[07:46] <Enselic> MBro: See? No nasty terminal hacks as you though :P
[07:46] <Enselic> thought*
[07:46] <soundray> Morrissey: I don't know, sry
[07:46] <mjo> Hi
[07:47] <MBro> yeah, didn't even see that menu option, i was searching through the services
[07:47] <emilia> soop : i know they work, the usb drive light turns on, and my camera says connected
[07:47] <voltz> hey Sebboh
[07:47] <Grey_Loki> soundray, right - i'll give it a go in the generic kernel then. BBIAB.
[07:47] <emilia> soop : but they dont mount
[07:47] <soundray> Morrissey: you might be able to record your graphics card TV out via your TV card.
[07:47] <Morrissey> Does anyone know if istanbul (or some other desktop recording app) that will record in OK quality? for now its frame rate is 10
[07:48] <Morrissey> soundray, sound complicated :)
[07:48] <naitmer> !ubotu kernel version
[07:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kernel version - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[07:48] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[07:48] <Sebboh> voltz! wow, small world!
[07:48] <Sebboh> :D
[07:48] <voltz> :)
[07:48] <Morrissey> soundray, cant tell why istanbul doesnt have a setting to get more then 10 fr/sec :)
[07:49] <soundray> Sebboh: make sure that /mnt/hdb1 has proper permissions also
[07:50] <Sebboh> Voltz, if you come to the US some time, contact me. =)  Real name's David Loyall, that should make it easy enough. ;)
[07:50] <Sebboh> sound, ahh!
[07:50] <emilia> soop : also my printer is usb, and its fine
[07:50] <Sebboh> kneer0w?? Loki?  wtf is this, an EFnet invasion? haha
[07:50] <Grey_Loki> soundray, no good, i'm afraid - sudo sudo nvidia-glx-config enable still give the same error.
[07:50] <emilia> anyone know whats stopping my usb devices from mounting?

[07:51] <pianoboy3333> Where can I get the latest libnautilus-burn and libnautilus-extension?
[07:51] <ScislaC> soundray: holy moly, it WANTS to do it but now it's complaining about libs needing to be higher than they are (kinda weird)
[07:51] <soundray> Grey_Loki: sorry I have to go... There is a troubleshooting section at the end of those instructions. I would follow that next.
[07:51] <Grey_Loki> soundray, gotcha. Thanks for your help :)
[07:52] <rab23> hi
[07:53] <rab23> i've a problem with tv card...mentor bt878 chip...the card is installed, driver are ok, but don't tune correctly
[07:53] <emilia> does anyone know how ot check if theres a setting for nautilus to mount usb drives ? maybe mine is off
[07:53] <rab23> i've set already tv card number and tune number
[07:53] <soundray> ScislaC: an inconsistent package database is a bad thing. If you fix all the errors one by one, you will get it working again at some point. But it might cost you enough time to make a reinstall worthwhile :(

[08:06] <dueyfinster> DevC: Oh right, have you tryed uninstalling and reinstalling it?
[08:06] <YoussefAssad> quick question; where do I go to RTFM re. making ubuntu packages? Hopefully to be included in the sources
[08:06] <DevC> yeah, before I wasn't able to even get it to load now I can but no fonts show up when I load it
[08:07] <[erisco] > Hello. I have a directory in /var/www/ that is chowned to my user and to the group of www-data... it is also chmodded to 774. Everything in /var/www/ has these same permissions. However one directory will not open, and it will say access was denied. Why?
[08:07] <cmweb> :-[
[08:07] <dueyfinster> DevC: Do you have any graphics drivers installed?
[08:07] <dueyfinster> DevC: Is it just Firefox?
[08:07] <uruguaian> hi.. can i configure ubuntu to use a windows shared conection???
=== gustavo is now known as suricate

[08:08] <dueyfinster> !Samba
[08:08] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[08:09] <edwardsNdallas> anyone know how to set up RAID5 for LAMP
[08:09] <uruguaian> samba isnt for share files/printers?
[08:10] <dueyfinster> uruguaian: Yes, is that not the co-operation you were on about?
[08:10] <qos_> why can't i fakeroot into /media/hdd where i mounted my recently installed ubuntu linux? if i want to "fakeroot /media/hdd" it always says "/usr/bin/fakeroot: 152: /media/hdd/: Permission denied"
[08:11] <hou5ton> video on CNN works, and on YouTube, ... but on Fox news only gives me sound, no video?    I've installed some multimedia stuff with Automatix2 .... do I need to add REalplayer or something?
[08:11] <Hausberg> is there a way of installing an older version of ubuntu's xorg-fglrx-driver?
[08:11] <itsx> hi:) suddenly the sound doesnt work ... what i can check?
[08:11] <xipietotec> Does anyone know where the diskmanager is?
[08:11] <YoussefAssad> hou5ton: I don't think Fox was meant to run on linux
[08:11] <hou5ton> :-)
[08:12] <defrysk> hou5ton, maybe using automatix was a poor desicion
[08:12] <dueyfinster> hou5ton: Check what format it is. Is it now flash?
[08:12] <uruguaian> with files/printers theres no problem... i've to connect to a windows machine.. 'share internet conection'.. idont' know how to say.. =(
[08:12] <[erisco] > Does anyone know if there are additional permission "things" other than chown and chmod?
[08:12] <[erisco] > I cannot access a folder that is chmodded to 777!
[08:12] <hou5ton> dueyfinster:   I installed flash using Automatix. ....
[08:12] <Lattyware> Which has better support under Ubuntu, the Creative Zen Vision:M or the Ipod?
[08:12] <defrysk> !automatix > hou5ton
[08:12] <hou5ton> defrysk:   hopefully is wasn't .... is there something you need to gell me?
[08:12] <Hausberg> [erisco]  chgrp
[08:12] <Grey_Loki> If anyone sees soundrun, let him know that I fixed my display error :P
[08:12] <Grey_Loki> Thanks :)
[08:13] <DevC> where are the logs for xchat usually at?
[08:13] <dueyfinster> hou5ton: Are you using firefox? check flash version by right clicking on a flash item on a webpage
[08:13] <defrysk> hou5ton, read your private message from ubotu
[08:13] <dueyfinster> hou5ton: I recommend the latest beta from adobe, it seems to fix alot of issues and it isn't hard to install
[08:13] <savvas> does anyone know when and if mozilla seamonkey will be in the official repos?
[08:14] <[erisco] > Hausberg, I used chown already to set the group to www-data. The file owner is me. I still cannot open the directory.
[08:14] <jbroome> savvas: probably not until they have an official release
[08:14] <xipietotec> Anyone? Where is the disks manager in ubuntu edgy?
[08:14] <defrysk> savvas, unlikely for now I think
[08:14] <savvas> ok thank you
[08:14] <Hausberg> [erisco] , yes but there is also the group
[08:14] <[erisco] > hausberg, yes and the group is www-data, I said that
[08:15] <hou5ton> dueyfinster:   I guess it's version 9
[08:15] <Hausberg> are you member of the www-data
[08:15] <defrysk> !flash9
[08:15] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[08:15] <uruguaian> duey: i can see the windows network and printers, but how to share the conection?
[08:15] <hfhf> i have an intel 2200bg (ipw2200) on edgy. i'd like to try kismet, aircrack and tools. how to setup monitor mode? is this guide good? http://kerneltrap.org/node/5414/print or is there an easier way?
[08:16] <pommes_tgfp> anyone installed beryl on a Dell laptop
[08:16] <Hausberg> [erisco]  are you member of that group? if not useradd -g yourusername www-data
[08:16] <xipietotec> Anyone? The disks manager? I can't find it and I need to format a disk
[08:17] <[erisco] > Hausberg, I am the OWNER of the file
[08:17] <Hausberg> [erisco]  yes but if you are not part of the group to which the file belongs and if group permissions are not right you can't access it
[08:18] <edwardsNdalla1> anyone install RAID5 on LAMP?
[08:18] <[erisco] > Hausberg, the permissions are right. The owner has read write and execute, same as the group. Even when I do set the group to my user, I still cannot access the directory. All other directories in the /var/www/ have the exact same permissions and the exact same ownership, yet I can access them
[08:19] <hou5ton> defrysk:   so .... I take it you would recommend taking that Automatix line out of the repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list?
[08:19] <defrysk> hou5ton, thats too late
[08:19] <defrysk> its alredy installed
[08:19] <defrysk> there is no uninstallscript for automatix
[08:19] <hou5ton> dang .... I have been assimilated
[08:19] <swaby1> is it possible to get a lexmark x1240 printer to work using ubuntu?
[08:20] <defrysk> hou5ton, yes indeed :D
[08:20] <phoenix87ta> having a bit of a problem mounting a vfat partition.  gotten as far as editing the fstab, but I get an error when I actually try to mount
[08:20] <GeekChick> how do you gksudo a nautilus window to allow you to move files graphically?
[08:20] <defrysk> hou5ton, just make sure to do a fresh install when feisty comes out :)
[08:20] <GeekChick> from desktop to like bin
[08:20] <Lattyware> Which has better support under Ubuntu, the Creative Zen Vision:M or the Ipod?
[08:21] <blackgraz> anyone have a orinoco pcmcia card(hermes chipset) and gotten it to work in monitor mode?
[08:21] <hou5ton> defrysk:   I a little reluctant to do another install if I ever get this one working right.  :)
[08:21] <Jessehk> I've set up Xgl so that it has its own xsession. I wan beryl-manager to start only when I choose that session from GDM. Is that possible?
[08:21] <swaby1> This new printer is killing me
[08:21] <defrysk> hou5ton, using automatix is not the way to get things working right
[08:21] <Hausberg> [erisco]  ok ... and did you use chmod -R option to take care that subdirectories are also in order? can you access it as root
[08:21] <GeekChick> how do you gksudo a nautilus window to allow you to move files graphically into protected folders?
[08:22] <edwardsNdalla1> anyone install RAID5 on LAMP that can help with 4 hard drives?
[08:22] <swaby1> can anyone help
[08:22] <Hausberg> [erisco]  you are talking about /var/www do you mean accessing it via webpage or just on terminal?
[08:22] <defrysk> !anyone | swaby1
[08:22] <ubotu> swaby1: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:22] <corevette> whats the irc channel for mplayer
[08:22] <mog_> Bonsoir
[08:22] <[erisco] > Hausberg, I can access it through the command line without being root. I am talking about my file browser and my terminal, not my web browser. Also I did use recursive.
[08:22] <mog_> COmment installer XP?
[08:23] <Lattyware> defrysk: He asked a bit further up, and then was continuing from that.
[08:23] <mog_> a partir de Linux?
[08:23] <swaby1> Is it possible to get a lexmark x1240 printer to work with ubuntu?
[08:23] <Anyone> Hi, I am facing some major problems trying to install the new Ubuntu.  The target computer had win98 installed, so it asked for a resize.  Now its taking forever, and I wonder if its safe to click cancel or whats safe?
[08:23] <defrysk> Lattyware, missed that bit :s
[08:23] <savvas> !fr
[08:23] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:23] <defrysk> swaby1, lexmark is worst printer to get for linux
[08:23] <blackgraz> haha
[08:23] <mykal> Anyone: :)
[08:24] <blackgraz> anyone have a orinoco pcmcia card(hermes chipset) and gotten it to work in monitor mode?
[08:24] <Anyone> swaby1, the easy answer is "yes" .. but truth is it might be hard.  However, Lexmark does have some GNU/Linux drivers on their website.
[08:24] <[erisco] > Hausberg, I cannot access the directory through the file browser
[08:24] <Anyone> blackgraz, No, I don't. Sorry.  I don't have PCMCIA at all..
[08:24] <swaby1> okay I thought so
[08:24] <Hausberg> [erisco]  I can't quite follow - you can access it via commandline like cd in it?
[08:24] <Lattyware> Which has better support under Ubuntu, the Creative Zen Vision:M or the Ipod?
[08:24] <swaby1> thanks anyway
[08:24] <[erisco] > Hausberg, yes
[08:24] <Anyone> mykilx, :)
[08:24] <blackgraz> Anyone: you got a hermes chipset wifi?
[08:24] <Anyone> blackgraz, not to my knowledge.
[08:25] <phoenix87ta> I get a wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb error while trying to mount a vfat partition after modifying the fstab.  any idea what I did wrong?
[08:25] <Scrutinizer> hi there :)
[08:25] <swaby1> no wonder it was cheap
[08:25] <[erisco] > Hausberg, hold on I think I got something
[08:25] <Anyone> swaby1, do check out lexmark homepage though.
[08:25] <[erisco] > Hausberg, I have a link to /var/www/ on my desktop
[08:25] <Hausberg> [erisco]  that is interesting - is the file manager running under your user? if you cd in that directory and launch konqueror?
[08:25] <Scrutinizer> ive got a problem with my soundcards. please query me
[08:26] <[erisco] > Hausberg, if I go through that I CANNOT open the single directory, but all others. If I manually go through /var/www/ I can open that trouble directory.
[08:26] <kandinski> is scrollkeeper broken on edgy?
=== rmbl`off is now known as rmbl
[08:26] <kandinski> I am installing and scrollkeeper breaks the isntall
[08:26] <Anyone> I guess its safe to repeat my question.
[08:27] <kelly> i have lost my waste basket how do i get it back?
[08:27] <jrt> Has anyone managed to get 'unionfs
[08:27] <jrt> working in edgy?
[08:27] <defrysk> swaby1, before getting a printer have a look at http://www.linuxprinting.org/
[08:27] <Anyone> Hi, I am facing some major problems trying to install the new edgy eft Ubuntu desktop.  The target computer had win98 installed, so it asked for a resize.  Now its taking forever, and I wonder if its safe to click cancel or whats safe?
[08:27] <Hausberg> [erisco]  sounds more like a prob with the file manager rather than with file system, outside chmod, chown and chgrp there is no other permission bits
[08:27] <Anyone> jrt: Nope .. I didn't try though.
[08:27] <bife[ubuntu] > hy
[08:27] <corevette> hello, does anyone know what the irc channel for mplayer is?
[08:27] <Hausberg> is there a way to rollback to older ati-drivers?
[08:27] <Anyone> defrysk, they quit.
[08:27] <defrysk> Anyone, yeah unfortunately
[08:27] <Anyone> CoreDuo, I guess its #mplayer..
[08:28] <Anyone> CoreDuo, sorry
[08:28] <[erisco] > Hausberg, indeed. Through the terminal I can go through my link and access the folder without being root. However not through the file browser.
[08:28] <Anyone> Corevette, I guess its #mplayer..

[08:31] <Jowi> blanky, it is mounted?
[08:31] <Anyone> blanky, make a backup, then delete the partition, and restore from backup.  Be carefull to preserve date, ownership and stuff on the backup though.
[08:31] <kelly> defrysk thankyou done it
[08:31] <kelly> does anyone know how to get the newest version of amsn?

[08:32] <blanky> which I wanted ext3 to consume
[08:32] <Anyone> blanky, ahh .. then you can assign that space to ext3!
[08:32] <Jowi> blanky, you will not be able to do that on a mounted partition
[08:32] <hou5ton> I get all the sound, just no video
[08:32] <kelly> does anybody know what amsn is here??

[08:34] <kelly> blanky true you never know
[08:34] <blanky> :D
[08:34] <Jowi> blanky, you will not be able to do anything with the root partition while it is mounted. I suggest you boot a live cd and resize it there. remember to backup important data before you do anything though
[08:34] <blanky> kelly: if not, then why not give gaim a go? or you don't like it? If you're running kde, kopete might be nice too
[08:34] <Anyone> blanky, its a bit hard to help you now .. cause I see your problem.  You have two ext3
[08:34] <blanky> Jowi: I am on a live cd, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say it was mounted

[08:35] <kelly> blanky i tried to run gaim messenger but i cannot see my contacts on there
[08:35] <blanky> watch guys, I'll upload a screenshot is that okay?
[08:35] <Anyone> blanky, then you should be able to click the "install" icon.
[08:35] <blanky> Anyone: yes...
[08:35] <xipietotec> Anyone: How exactly would I find that out? It's telling me it's just "usbdrive"

[08:36] <Anyone> Hi, I am facing some major problems trying to install the new edgy eft Ubuntu desktop.  The target computer had win98 installed, so it asked for a resize.  Now its taking forever (an hour or so, so far), and I wonder if its safe to click cancel or whats safe?
[08:36] <xipietotec>  it's /media/usbdisk
[08:36] <mabus> How do I install xubuntu packages onto an ubuntu system with just both cdroms? I have no internet at home. I tried adding the cdrom in the repositories menu of synaptic, and updating, but no go.
[08:36] <blanky> kelly: also, try joining #gaim they're pretty helpful
[08:36] <Anyone> xipietotec, in prompt type "mount | grep "/media/usbdisk"
[08:37] <kelly> blanky ok
[08:37] <blanky> Anyone: that's something I was afraid of, if it failed
[08:37] <blanky> Anyone: but resizing does take a while, what's the size?
[08:37] <dragonfyre13> I'm having some issues with wireless on edgy eft with ndiswrapper. I don't understand how wireless works on linux yet, as I've always used a wired connection. I have an rt73 chipset card, and the ndiswrapper driver is installed. It won't connect to any networks though.
[08:37] <timo90> help installing the new amsn i get :./configure: line 3041: /usr/lib/tkConfig.sh: No such file or directory
[08:37] <Anyone> blanky, new size is 21.5 GB.
[08:37] <xipietotec> /dev/sda1 on /media/usbdisk type vfat
[08:37] <edwardsNdallas> anyone install RAID5 on LAMP that can help with 4 hard drives?
[08:38] <Anyone> timo90, you probably do not have the proper version of TCL/TK installed...
[08:38] <dragonfyre13> I've tried connecting to unprotected networks, and those with wep encryption so far. I'm not going to connect to any with WPA, so I don't need to worry about wpasupplicant.
[08:38] <dragonfyre13> anyone have a clue about why?
[08:38] <Anyone> edwardsNdallas, sorry no, I cannot help.
[08:38] <blanky> Anyone: from?
[08:38] <DevC> what is the link for upgrading one last time, this time I'm going to enter it into my WinXP laptop so I don't lose it
[08:38] <Anyone> dragonfyre13, why what?
[08:38] <Anyone> blanky, the drive is 80GB
[08:39] <hou5ton> Does Fox video even use Flash?
[08:39] <xipietotec>  Anyone: okay...it's /dev/sda1
[08:39] <Anyone> xipietotec, cool. You want to wipe it for use with GNU/Linux only?
[08:39] <xipietotec> Anyone: Actually no, I intend to use this as a USB stick for my car stereo.

[09:02] <seraphim> wce: have a look at step 2 option 1
[09:02] <dragonfyre13> Dreamer, can you fill programs
[09:02] <dreamer> niekie: that doesn't work. the KB is _dead_
[09:03] <dreamer> dragonfyre13: fill ?
[09:03] <dragonfyre13> Dreamer, can ssh into this one from another box
[09:03] <dreamer> yes
[09:03] <seraphim> wce: you better bookmark the guide, you will need to reboot inbetweeb
[09:03] <niekie> dreamer, dead as in?
[09:03] <ramon> ubotu: yes, i had a bad feeling about it. is there not some quick and dirty way i can just remove the 'onboard' package it keeps complaining about?
[09:03] <niekie> Physically broken?
[09:03] <dreamer> niekie: no response, switching numlock for instance
[09:03] <dragonfyre13> Dreamer sorry kill
[09:03] <niekie> dreamer, hmm..
[09:03] <blanky> kelly_: are you there
[09:04] <dreamer> dragonfyre13: I don't know
[09:04] <niekie> dreamer, you could try it anyway, but I doubt it works then indeed.
[09:04] <dreamer> niekie: I have and it doesn't
[09:04] <niekie> Though it has worked for me in some odd situations.
[09:04] <niekie> dreamer, allright then.
[09:04] <wce> another thing,  As i got told i shouldnt use automatix... what else can i use with the same features?
[09:04] <niekie> Do you still have SSH access working to it?
[09:04] <phaedrus44> hey TokenBad  wussup
[09:04] <chaplinux> W: GPG error: http://packages.freecontrib.org edgy-plf Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F120156012B83718 ??
[09:04] <dreamer> niekie: read my replies: yes
[09:04] <chaplinux> as to be notarized?
[09:04] <niekie> dreamer, ah.
[09:04] <niekie> You can do it from remote then.
[09:04] <phaedrus44> anyone help me with my wireless probelm?  i am using ndiswrapper 1.8 with a usb dongle...i have never had this problem in the past..but my connection just keeps dropping...
[09:04] <dreamer> niekie: how then ?
[09:05] <dreamer> I don't have a /etc/init.d/kdm
[09:05] <niekie> dreamer, sudo -i to get a root shell first.
[09:05] <Yasuo|Ikwakura> hi,  openoffice-calc => how can i can i define a field so oocalc asks me for the content in templates?
[09:05] <nikin> how can i use the mouse in shell? i have a server install
[09:05] <TokenBad> phaedrus44, not much man
[09:05] <seraphim> wce: go through the ubuntu-help and do the stuff manually. it's a lot better than all programs for that, because you learn a lot and know what you did
[09:05] <niekie> Then echo thekey >>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:05] <dreamer> niekie: ok
[09:05] <niekie> Replace thekey with the corresponding key.
[09:05] <dreamer> you lost me there ..
[09:05] <dreamer> what key ?
[09:05] <phaedrus44> sweet
[09:05] <TokenBad> tried vista for about 2 days
[09:06] <TokenBad> went back to ubuntu
[09:06] <TokenBad> heheh
[09:06] <dreamer> haha
[09:06] <cybervegan> phaedrus44: have you got your wireless usb card set to be the default gateway? do you have a wired port configured that is not used?
[09:06] <niekie> dreamer, the key you would normally use after ALT-SysRQ
[09:06] <niekie> So what you would do is:
[09:06] <TokenBad> phaedrus44, you on under?
[09:06] <niekie> echo r>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <niekie> echo s>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <niekie> echo e>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <niekie> echo i>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <niekie> echo u>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <dragonfyre13> nikin, it needs to be a curses inter face
[09:06] <niekie> echo b>>/proc/sysrq-trigger
[09:06] <niekie> That's all :)
[09:07] <niekie> Wait a little while between the commands.
[09:07] <dreamer> niekie: why in that order? and what does it do ?
[09:07] <nikin> dragonfyre13: so i cant use mouse in a program like nano
[09:07] <niekie> dreamer, r puts the keyboard in raw mode.
[09:07] <niekie> That might fix the keyboard.
[09:07] <dragonfyre13> nikin, no
[09:07] <dreamer> ok
[09:07] <wce> ok, i just manually downloaded the last version of Xchat... How can i install it through the command line?
[09:07] <niekie> So first try the keyboard after that.
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[09:08] <niekie> S means sync to disk, U means unmount all disks and remount read-only
[09:08] <dragonfyre13> nikin, Using the mouse depends on the program it self
[09:08] <seraphim> wce: you better install programs from synaptic if they are available there :P
[09:08] <hydraw> does non-US ASCII mean not '' signs...
[09:08] <niekie> E and I terms/kills processes.
[09:08] <niekie> B reboots.
[09:08] <niekie> dreamer, any lock with r fixing your keyboard?
[09:08] <ramon> i need to force the removal of a package (or at least tell apt to ignore it) that is giving errors every time i run apt-get. is this possible?
[09:08] <nikin> dragonfyre: what i realy need is to copy some text between programs and the shell
[09:09] <mike1o> i can't manage to use an usb pci adapter... any help?
[09:09] <niekie> s/lock/luck/
[09:09] <dreamer> and U ?
[09:09] <dragonfyre13> hydraw, yes
[09:09] <dreamer> niekie: no, KB still dead
[09:09] <dragonfyre13> nikin, on a server
[09:09] <niekie> Aww..
[09:09] <netron> hello. is the intel pro/wireless 2200BG chipset supported by default with the 6.10 live-cd?
[09:09] <hydraw> ok
[09:09] <hydraw> thanks
[09:09] <andy> How do I change in GIMP the input device from mouse to Wacom tablet (both USB devices)?
[09:09] <kitche> ramon: did you read what ubotu said about automatix?
[09:09] <niekie> dreamer, then the only thing left to do is to proceed with seiub
[09:09] <wce> THEY are available but they dont offer the last version on synaptic
[09:09] <dragonfyre13> hydraw, np
[09:09] <niekie> And the system will then reboot.
[09:09] <niekie> Probably having saved all data.
[09:10] <nikin> dragonfyre: yes, on a server :) it is evil but it is so
[09:10] <niekie> Again, wait some time between the commands.
[09:10] <ramon> kitche: yes, but reinstalling the whole system is difficult, i don't have a fast internet connection
[09:10] <niekie> And don't do them in one command, heh.
[09:10] <dreamer> niekie: after e SSH closed :/
[09:10] <niekie> dreamer, doh.
[09:10] <niekie> Hah.
[09:10] <mike1o> does the fact that a device is not recongnized right away mean that it's impossible to use?
[09:10] <killown> how I switch a icon menu gnome to other icon?
[09:10] <seraphim> wce: if you really want to compile it yourself have a look at the README file
[09:10] <dreamer> niekie: and the screen of the machine is "gone"
[09:10] <niekie> dreamer, uhh... yeah.. stupid..
[09:10] <dragonfyre13> nikin, how long is the text
[09:10] <dreamer> (still bottom half filles with mess)
[09:10] <niekie> dreamer, sorry.. =\
[09:10] <niekie> dreamer, E terminates all processes.
[09:10] <ramon> kitche: there has got to be a quicker way!
[09:11] <niekie> I forgot SSH was a process.
[09:11] <niekie> =\
[09:11] <killown> hey please
[09:11] <nikin> dragonfyre: it waries from 2 words to 3-4 pages
[09:11] <dreamer> niekie: -doh-
[09:11] <recon> Would anybody know how to deal with the java error "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/xml/serialize/BaseMarkupSerializer"
[09:11] <niekie> dreamer, I apologise.
[09:11] <killown> how  I change icon menu gnome?
[09:11] <niekie> Hope you won't hate me for this =\
[09:11] <dreamer> niekie: so, I can't SSH, but the ping still flies
[09:11] <dragonfyre13> nikin, is there box that you can ssh into it
[09:11] <niekie> dreamer, hmm..
[09:12] <niekie> dreamer, any luck with the keyboard now?
[09:12] <rixth> How do I rebuild the initrd?
[09:12] <niekie> Try numlock again.
[09:12] <dreamer> niekie: hey yeah, the KB seams to be active
[09:12] <niekie> dreamer, cool. :)
[09:12] <nikin> dragonfyre: i can ssh in to the server, but thats the only linux box here
[09:12] <seraphim> hehe. that reminds me of "ifdown eth0" on the router...
[09:12] <niekie> dreamer, now you can proceed with I U B
[09:12] <dragonfyre13> nikin, thats fine
[09:12] <dreamer> niekie: but I can't do anything, so Num-Lock switch is only thing working
[09:12] <wce> how can i add repositories?
[09:12] <kitche> rramon: I don't knwo to much about how to fix it since automatix isn't really supported in here so when it breaks your system I would go ask in the automatix channel
[09:12] <niekie> Press ALT-SysRQ-I
[09:12] <niekie> Wait a while
[09:13] <stjepan> what Depth do you recommend??? 16 or 24
[09:13] <niekie> Then ALT-SysRQ-U
[09:13] <rixth> Also, does anyone find launchpad really slow at the moment?
[09:13] <niekie> Then again, wait a while.
[09:13] <seraphim> stjepan: 24
[09:13] <niekie> Then ALT-SysRQ-B
[09:13] <ramon> recon: search google for what jar file it would be in and make sure you have it and that it is in your classpath environment variable
[09:13] <dragonfyre13> nikin, ssh into the box copy everything from the ssh window then paste it when you need to into the comand line
[09:13] <niekie> And it "should" reboot.
[09:13] <dreamer> niekie: KB dead again :/
[09:13] <rixth> stjepan, more is always better =)
[09:13] <niekie> dreamer, =\
[09:13] <dragonfyre13> nikin, thats the easy way
[09:13] <dreamer> niekie:  btw: what is the SysRQ-button ?
[09:13] <niekie> dreamer, PrintScreen.
[09:13] <dreamer> aah, that one X|
[09:14] <dreamer> haha, I just saw it
[09:14] <andy> How do I change in GIMP the input device from mouse to Wacom tablet (both USB devices)?
[09:14] <stjepan> seraphim, rixth, isn't 16 safer?
[09:14] <nikin> dragonfyre: that method is a bit evil :D but ty
[09:14] <niekie> dreamer, tell me if you have any luck with the SysRQ commands.
[09:14] <dreamer> niekie: I'm pressing reset :/
[09:14] <rixth> stjepan, probably, but the risk is negiliglbe
[09:14] <niekie> dreamer, allright.
[09:14] <rixth> negligble, even
[09:14] <Kingsqueak> recon: I think you need to install xerces
[09:14] <dragonfyre13> nikin, evil gets things done :)
[09:14] <killown> how  I change icon menu gnome?
[09:14] <webmind> good evening
[09:14] <nikin> dragon: thats sure
[09:14] <wce> how can i add repositories.... Imcurrently installing my nvidia card and it says that i should a a repository that they provide...
[09:14] <recon> Kingsqueak: I'm ok, getting help in ##java.
[09:14] <Kingsqueak> recon: possibly libxerces-java
[09:15] <Doow> andy: try #gimp-users on GIMPNet
[09:15] <dreamer> niekie: what log to check for error's ?
[09:15] <seraphim> wce: add the complete line to /etc/apt/sources.list and do apt-get update
[09:15] <dreamer> haha
[09:15] <Doow> andy: they probably know better
[09:15] <webmind> I'd like to mount my encrypted /home before login, I tried making a boot script.. but it doesn't show any of it's output
[09:15] <niekie> dreamer, /var/log/messages probably.
[09:15] <mike1o> does the fact that a device is not recongnized right away mean that it's impossible to use?
[09:15] <webmind> and it can never ask it's passphrase question
[09:15] <dreamer> niekie: care to check it for me? :#
[09:15] <seraphim> wce: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:15] <andy> Doow, Thank you very much.
[09:15] <dragonfyre13> nikin, the other way is to delete everything other then what you want in the file save as something else then pipe it into a comand line
[09:15] <mike1o> i can't manage to use an usb 2.0 pci adapter... any help?
[09:15] <dragonfyre13> nikin, hard to do
[09:16] <squig> Hey, does anyone know a mirror for the install files for beryl? their main site is down
[09:16] <Varjat_by> Hi! I have a problems with lirc installing.. Is it possible to instal LIRC without buildig kernel modules as it done in Debian and other ditributios?
[09:16] <nikin> dragonfyre: je thats kinda hard
[09:16] <niekie> dreamer, /var/log/messages gives me kernel messages.
[09:16] <wce> seraphin, doesnt matter if i place the line in the biggining or at th end?
[09:16] <Varjat_by>  cann't compile current lirc-kernel-modules ..
[09:16] <niekie> So if you want to check those for errors, then yeah :)
[09:16] <Doow> squig: ask in #beryl ^^
[09:16] <nikin> so there is nothing like a clipboard for the console
[09:16] <nikin> :(
[09:16] <niekie> Also gives some other logs, apparently.
[09:16] <squig> Okay Doow, sorry 'bout that
[09:16] <killown> how  I change icon menu gnome?
[09:16] <niekie> I'm not that familiar with the logging part of Linux, unfortunately.
[09:16] <seraphim> wce: if you put them at the end in a several block you remember better what was changed by you. but it doesn't really matter
[09:16] <Doow> squig: np, just trying to lessen the load here a little =)
[09:17] <xipietotec> great...USB has a file system lock on it and sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/sda1 does nothing. Do I need to umount the disk before I can change permissions?
[09:17] <maXlo> hello there
[09:17] <kyawzin> Can anybody help me with MAC address hardcoding?
[09:17] <iqloo> Hiho all
[09:17] <maXlo> i have ubuntu 6.06, and a big problem with oofice
[09:17] <maXlo> it does not save the images inside the docs
[09:17] <maXlo> do you know if this is a ubuntu tweak?
[09:18] <kyawzin> I can change the MAC address by running " ifconfig eth0 hw ether 01:02:03:04:05:06" like that
[09:18] <kelly_> can anybody help with belkin wireless g card problems??
[09:18] <kyawzin> but
[09:18] <maXlo> (i have another linux, gentoo, and by default the images are inserted in the document)
[09:18] <killown> how  I change icon menu gnome?
[09:18] <Doow> maXlo: I think there's an option if you want to save inside or just have a link to the images, try asking in #OpenOffice.org
[09:18] <kyawzin> I got to run that command everytime after I boot the system
[09:18] <maXlo> Doow: ok, tx
[09:18] <ramon> ok, so say i try to install a package and it fails half way through and then every time i run apt-get i get the message "1 not fully installed or removed" referring to the problematic operation. how do i cancel this operation?
[09:18] <XiXaQ> I want to install an email server on my system. Where can I get one?
[09:19] <PenguinOfDoom> How do I get the totem mozilla plugin to work at all? It won't do mp3s, it won't do windows media. Does it play anything at all?
[09:19] <kyawzin> I want to hardcoded the change in MAC address so that I don't need to run the command every time
[09:19] <Apollo> does sarge have a device manager and where would that be?
[09:19] <Kingsqueak> kyawzin: you understand that doing that may cause you trouble right?  aside from that /etc/network/interfaces should take 'ether' as an argument, check 'man interfaces'

[09:23] <iqloo> Hiho all, I need some help installing Firefox32 on XubuntuAMD64 - I've tried every article I can find (google) and still get this error.."error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0" - I have found where that library is, but I don't know how to edit the file so that it will know to look there.
[09:23] <Doow> killown: try #gnome at GIMPNet
[09:23] <nikin> mivan kiirva?
[09:23] <nikin> sorry
[09:24] <kitche> iqloo: it sees the file but it's looking for the 32bit library of it
[09:24] <iqloo> export GTK_PATH=/emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib/ <- to me that should work as "libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0" is located in that directory
[09:25] <Doow> iqloo: you can probably make a symlink to the library
[09:25] <clandestino> Where do you change the umask for all users?
[09:25] <Doow> iqloo: oops, taht was to kitche and you're allready on it
[09:25] <kelly_> can you download music with azureus torrent??
[09:25] <Doow> iqloo: ignore me =)
[09:25] <iqloo> Still a bit noob, where should I make the symlink to?
[09:26] <Doow> kelly_: if you find a torrent with the music you want, sure
[09:26] <Kingsqueak> clandestino: shell profiles so .profile for one user or the /etc/profile
[09:26] <kelly_> doow how do you find a torrent??
[09:26] <Doow> kelly_: try google =)
[09:26] <kitche> Doow: doesn't matter he's trying to build 32 bit with out the 32bit libs
[09:26] <Doow> kitche: oh, he's trying to build, dunno about that
[09:26] <iqloo> kitche: I have "ia32-libs-gtk" and "ia32-libs" installed, I thought those installed the 32 libs? - And isn't that what I'm pointing at?
[09:26] <clandestino> Kingsqueak: Thanks
[09:26] <nikin> clandestino : /etc/profile if i remember good
[09:27] <Doow> kitche: thought it was a matter of having the right files on the system, but Fx searched for the wrong name =)
[09:27] <kitche> iqloo: that might be the libs you want but error loading doesn't really tell us much about the error your getting
[09:28] <Varjat_by> Is anybody know how to fix problem with LIRC building? http://rafb.net/paste/results/BGx2WG76.html
[09:28] <Doow> kitche: any way, I'll leave it to you

[09:39] <grimboy> naitmer, I think I got that too.
[09:39] <wce> nop
[09:39] <naitmer> great, so what that is means?
[09:39] <grimboy> !dual-boot | Riyonuk
[09:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dual-boot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:40] <grimboy> wce, Then it's probably working.
[09:40] <corduroy> grimboy: but you probably want to do "touch $HOME/./.hushlogin" .. see: man login
[09:40] <naitmer> !error exit status 102
[09:40] <nette> Riyonuk, i don't know... maybe u did someting wrong when choosing disks for / /swap and so on..?
[09:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about error exit status 102 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:40] <wce> thanks
[09:40] <Riyonuk> do I create a partition in windows or with ubuntu's?
[09:40] <m4rk> thanks Dheeraj_k
[09:40] <corduroy> grimboy: obviously: "touch $HOME/.hushlogin"
[09:40] <naitmer> !error 102
[09:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about error 102 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:40] <nette> Riyonuk, u can do it both.. using i.e partition magic in windows is probably easiest...
[09:40] <grimboy> corduroy, Ah, cool.
[09:41] <corduroy> can someone tell me if there is a repo for  packages that are in testing phase?  i'm looking for a newer release and before i start building my own..
[09:41] <m4rk> Dheeraj_k: I have sound working, I just want to reverse the channels, if that is possible
[09:41] <nette> hey anyone using the evolution calendars? have a problem with setting colors on different categories.. i choose a color .. but they all get blue (default) anyway..

[09:43] <grimboy> Riyonuk, What kind of errors?
[09:43] <nette> Riyonuk, hms.. that's weird.. if you have one large disk you should try to resize it first... make room for the amount of space u need for ubuntu.. try that first
[09:43] <kelly_> how do you get plug ins for totem movie player??
[09:43] <Riyonuk> thats what I am trying
[09:43] <nette> kelly_, try searching with apt...
[09:43] <Riyonuk> I just have one partition, which is C:\

[09:44] <wce> hey, where can i find the repositories for beryl?? i got a guide but any of the provided repo's links work... they say error 404
[09:44] <grimboy> Riyonuk, You might need to defragment it first.
[09:44] <Riyonuk> 55.93GB
[09:44] <Riyonuk> already defragmented
[09:44] <m4rk> kelly_: mp3s is cool
[09:44] <Subhuman> wce, best to ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:44] <Subhuman> just youl lget a quicker answer.
[09:44] <grimboy> Riyonuk, What's are the errors?
[09:45] <nette> Riyonuk, try again.. resize it so it's 30gig free for the ubuntu
[09:45] <Brunellus> has anybody gotten the gspca webcam driver working in edgy?
[09:45] <Riyonuk> ill try it again
[09:45] <kitche> wce: the beryl official website

[09:46] <tobster> Does anyone know how to up grade to the new version of aMSN?
[09:46] <Riyonuk> alright, first I defragment
[09:46] <samuel> i have stupidly lost contact with a router by putting it into client-bridge
[09:46] <nette> Riyonuk, yeah, twice the ram for swap. one small for / and the rest for /home
[09:46] <Riyonuk> wait...what?
[09:46] <samuel> how can i regain contact through 192.168.1.1?
[09:46] <nette> kelly_ you need the xine engine
[09:46] <Riyonuk>  / and /home?
[09:47] <nette> Riyonuk, just try first to make a new partition 30 gig big.. the first step
[09:47] <tobster> Hi

[09:58] <niekie> dreamer, hmm.. =\
[09:59] <becky> Hi everyone
[09:59] <Sierra> gh0st, I've no idea. I'm not an expert -- I have Intel GFX
[09:59] <Stormx2> hey becky
[09:59] <Sierra> hey becky
[09:59] <Stormx2> w00t
[09:59] <Stormx2> snap
[09:59] <Sierra> ;)
[09:59] <becky> I just installed Edgy and I have a couple of questions
[09:59] <cmweb> every one hates me, always have always will
[09:59] <Stormx2> fire away..
[09:59] <Sierra> fire away becky
[09:59] <Sierra> grrr
[09:59] <Sierra> lol
[09:59] <Stormx2> O___O
[09:59] <Sierra> ;p
[09:59] <becky> In the Add/Remove bit, where is the "Advanced" button?
[09:59] <Stormx2> Do you have a twin?
[10:00] <Sierra> yeah, you are ;)
[10:00] <Sierra> are you trying to update your sources list becky
[10:00] <Sierra> ?
[10:00] <Stormx2> becky: Let me have a look, one moment.
[10:00] <Cyberai> can anyone tell me where ubuntu keeps the config that tells a compiler which installed kernel tree to compile against?
[10:00] <becky> Because I want to install something called "Splashy" so I can add new splash screens.
[10:00] <Stormx2> Sierra: No, she just installed edgy
[10:01] <Sierra> its possible that she may want to enable universe/multiverse/etc
[10:01] <Stormx2> Sierra: You may want to use Synaptic to get that. You'll find it under System > Administration > Synaptic
[10:01] <Stormx2> Eek
[10:01] <Stormx2> Not Sierra
[10:01] <Cyberai> I'm trying to run the NVidia installer, but it keeps compiling against a kernel I updated to, but then I went back to a previous kernel.
[10:01] <Stormx2> I meant becky
[10:02] <Cyberai> can anyone tell me where I could change the setting to make NVidia compile against the running kernel?
[10:02] <becky> StormX - I think that's what I want. In Dapper, there was an Advanced button to take you into that, wasn't there?
[10:02] <wce> i runned this command sudo apt-get update and it says at the end that the repositorie i used to install the nvidia drivers displays a error 404 error... is this normal?? i runene glxgears and i see 3 gears running!!
[10:02] <Stormx2> becky: I honestly can't remember, perhaps.
[10:03] <Stormx2> becky: It'd probably be quick to just go through the menu that way, mind ;-)
[10:03] <Skyrail> Anyone know of a good piece of video editing or creating software for ubuntu?
[10:03] <becky> Ahhhh - Synaptic, that's just what I was after.
[10:03] <samuel> cmweb - I have never had any sucess with rar. I think you need a package called unrar
[10:03] <becky> Do you know of any good places to get splash screens?
[10:03] <cmweb> un rar looking
[10:03] <Stormx2> Skyrail: Maybe run a search in synaptic or ubuntuforums.org, I don't know any
[10:03] <xipietotec> becky gnome-look.org
[10:03] <constrictor> becky: art.gnome.org
[10:04] <Skyrail> Stormx2: ok will do
[10:04] <Stormx2> becky: Perhaps gnome-look.org?
[10:04] <finalbeta> Are there any GNOME FTP clients? other then the anti usibility gFTP.
[10:04] <wce>  i runned this command sudo apt-get update and it says at the end that the repositorie i used to install the nvidia drivers displays a error 404 error... is this normal?? i runene glxgears and i see 3 gears running!!
[10:04] <samuel> http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/utils/unrar - choose the right one for you - dapper /edgy etc....
[10:04] <becky> Thanks all. I guess I will check out gnome-look.org
[10:04] <kitche> wce: means the repo is not there anymore
=== afknanmesis is now known as ananmesis
[10:04] <Stormx2> finalbeta: Oh I hate gFTP. You can mount FTP sites in gnome. Places > Connect to server. The best one is a firefox plugin called FireFTP, check it out! Its outstanding...
[10:04] <wce> is that good?
[10:04] <Stormx2> wce: No.
[10:05] <samuel> no try one of the mirrors i posted before wce
[10:05] <wce> what should i do then?
[10:05] <Stormx2> wce: A 404 means the repository is down/not working...
[10:05] <Stormx2> wce: Did you just update your sources.list?
[10:05] <wce> im talking abut the nvidia driver... not beryl
[10:05] <wce> yes
[10:05] <Stormx2> wce: Check you copied the line in correctly
[10:05] <wce> yes
[10:05] <finalbeta> Stormx2, FireFTP can do FXP/SSL connections and has a Site manager?
[10:06] <Stormx2> finalbeta: Not sure about part #1, it has something of a site manager
[10:06] <DreamerHxC> [wce]  what's up with your nvidia driver?
[10:06] <Stormx2> finalbeta: Namely you can select an account, it will connect, and go to folders (local and server)
[10:06] <wce> i typed glxgeras in the terminal and the gears are spining
[10:06] <Stormx2> finalbeta: if you use SmartFTP, its a lot like that I guess.
[10:07] <DreamerHxC> ah
[10:07] <wce> but i dont see nvidia drivers anywhere
[10:07] <DreamerHxC> nvidia driver doesn't work for me
[10:07] <Stormx2> Same as
[10:07] <finalbeta> SmartFTP is a toy :p. I used FlashFXP. I'll check it out, thnx
[10:07] <Stormx2> But i'm using a nvidia card from like, 1910
[10:07] <wce> any link with working nvidia drivers?
[10:07] <nolimitsoya> im looking for a good way of converting wma audio files to ogg, but all atempts in windows have failed. more specificaly, all metadata is lost during conversion. for linux, i havent found any program that will even recognice wma... any good ideas?
[10:07] <DreamerHxC> hehe
[10:07] <DreamerHxC> my ubuntu doesn't boot
[10:07] <DreamerHxC> it gets freezed just after logging in
[10:08] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Hmm, I think there is a converter in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[10:08] <becky> Does anyone know, Is it also possible to modify the boot screen for Edgy, the part where the progress bar shows when the computer is first booting?
[10:08] <Jowi> !usplash
[10:08] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[10:08] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, thank you.ill check it out :)
[10:09] <Riyonuk> Is linux ext3 or ext2?
[10:09] <Skyrail> one other thing, how can I search the iTunes store using Linux? will I be able to run iTunes using Wine?
[10:09] <Lynoure> Riyonuk: it can use either.
[10:09] <Riyonuk> which is better?
[10:09] <nette> Riyonuk, ext3 or ext2 is the partition type for the disk.. try ext3 that's best
[10:09] <Jowi> Riyonuk, ubuntu use ext3 by default
[10:09] <Riyonuk> alrighty
[10:09] <nette> Riyonuk, did it work to use partition magic now?
[10:10] <Riyonuk> I had to help my grandma
[10:10] <Riyonuk> Primary or Logical?
[10:10] <nette> Riyonuk, primary for linux
[10:10] <Riyonuk> ok and it shows it as MB
[10:10] <Riyonuk> what would be 30GB?
[10:10] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: nautilus-script-audio-convert may also help too.
[10:10] <Riyonuk> 30,000?
[10:11] <Cyberai> can anyone tell me where ubuntu keeps the config that tells a compiler which installed kernel tree to compile against?
[10:11] <Cyberai> I'm trying to run the NVidia installer, but it keeps compiling against a kernel I updated to, but then I went back to a previous kernel.
[10:11] <Stormx2> Cyberai: Sorry you're not getting an answer :( Maybe ubuntuforums.org can help?
[10:11] <Kurmiic> :Riyonuk Yes
[10:11] <kitche> Cyberai: Nvidia installer uses it's own check
[10:12] <nette> Riyonuk, yup
[10:12] <kitche> Cyberai: since it has nothing to do with Ubuntu looking for a ubuntu config won't help you
[10:12] <Cyberai> thanks kitche, darn it, maybe I can force it with a flag or option
[10:12] <nette> but you have to have 3 different partiotion.. now u have one for windows and one free of 30 gig, right?how much RAM do u have?
[10:13] <jbroome> Cyberai: is your /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to the old kernel?
[10:13] <Riyonuk> immedialty or later?
[10:13] <nette> Riyonuk, you should do it now
[10:13] <kitche> Cyberai: it does uname -r to get your kernel that you are running
[10:14] <Riyonuk> now the swap should be before windows?
[10:14] <Riyonuk> before linux but after windows
[10:14] <Riyonuk> or after linux?
[10:14] <nette> Riyonuk, make a partition for about 1GB for the swap disk, one more for / (root disk) and then the rest for... well the rest
[10:14] <Jowi> Riyonuk, windows always on first primary partition.
[10:14] <dreamer> hmm, how can I make a program run on startup in KDE?  it's damn easy in gnome, but I can't find anything for it in the KDE-menu ..
[10:15] <Cyberai> kitche, jbroome thanks, it looks like the NVidia installer lets you specify the kernel with a -k option
[10:15] <Cyberai> im going to look at my usr/src/linux link too
[10:15] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, i dont think that did it im afraid. all i found was soundconverter, and it still wont let me take on wma
[10:15] <Riyonuk> there SWAPSPACE2 is made
[10:15] <nolimitsoya> anyone got any good ideas for converting wma audio to ogg?
[10:15] <Riyonuk> how do I make a root?
[10:16] <zever> nolimitsoya, audacity??
[10:16] <marcion> Hello, I do not have Ubuntu here but I am writing some documentation for all Linux distros,
[10:16] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Have you got w32codecs installed?
[10:16] <marcion> can someone run this command for me
[10:16] <Riyonuk> or is Linux ext3 root?
[10:16] <marcion> apt-get --simulate install idle-python2.4
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> zever, will it work with wma, and keep metadata?
[10:16] <marcion> Does it try to remove python-minimal and install python2.4
[10:16] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, no i havnt. would it help?
[10:16] <marcion> ?
[10:16] <zever> nolimitsoya, don't know never tried
[10:16] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Most likely
[10:17] <Riyonuk> ok, Im gonna install
[10:17] <Riyonuk> hope it works
[10:17] <Jowi> Riyonuk, you should read an install guide
[10:17] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, the site for soundconverter does not list wma as a compatible format. only gstreamer formats.
[10:17] <nette> Riyonuk, i have a swap partition which is 1GB, my / (root) is only 60MB and then i have the rest (100GB) for the other stuff (/home and all that)
[10:17] <jbroome> marcion: vmware is your friend
[10:17] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: I thought gstreamer could play wma? 1 sec.,
[10:17] <marcion> jbroome, yeah I suppose
[10:18] <marcion> but is only this one question
[10:18] <kevinG> is it possible to get Beryl to work on 64 bit Dapper?

[10:19] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: My totem-gstreamer can play it
[10:19] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, using what gstreamer set?
[10:19] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: 1 sec.
[10:19] <Jowi> hou5ton, maybe it is in wmv9 format...
[10:20] <Lynoure> nolimitsoya: Unfortunately there are many versions of wma, some of them DRM-crippled

[10:20] <hou5ton> Jowi:   hmmmm..... ok ... what else do I need.  I mean.... I can even play videos on MSNBC
[10:20] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#oneline
[10:20] <hou5ton> Jowi:   and normally those won'[t work except in IED
[10:20] <hou5ton> IE
[10:20] <Jowi> hou5ton, if it is the latest windows video codec there are no support as far as I know

[10:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about burning img - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:21] <Kingsqueak> noldon: just right click on the file in nautilus and tell it to burn it to CD
[10:22] <grimboy> kevinG, Actually thinking about it, you might not get that error. It's an old post.
[10:22] <Lynoure> nolimitsoya: some ripping software drms even the stuff you rip yourself, scary that.
[10:22] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: What are you converting to?
[10:22] <noldon> Kingsqueak its dvd
[10:22] <Klesk> hey, quick question: i never used linux before, so i thought ubuntu may be a good idea to install.. now i wonder if 32-bit apps work in the 64-bit version too?
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> noldon: ah
[10:22] <jbroome> Klesk: yes
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> Lynoure, yes i know. i ripped using beoplayer, with the dram option turned of
[10:22] <kevinG> grimboy, is there an actualy how to on how to do it?
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> noldon: if it's just an img file it shouldn't matter
[10:22] <Klesk> jbroome: ok, thanks :)
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> noldon: if you are trying to copy a movie, that's another issue
[10:22] <noldon> Kingsqueak for some reason it dont wanna burn
[10:22] <Jowi> hou5ton, requires a plugin. which one i have no idea. I get a blank (well, golden actually) screen.
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> noldon: k
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, i thought ogg. matter of fact, soundconverter wont open any type of file at all...
[10:22] <nolimitsoya> whats up with that?
[10:23] <hou5ton> Jowi:   yep .... same screen I got
[10:23] <cntb> \o
[10:23] <noldon> sometimes it burn and finish but theres nothing on the dvd when i try it and sometimes i get a error message
[10:23] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: No idea. Where is your music stored? filesystem?
[10:23] <hou5ton> Jowi:   What about RealPlayer?
[10:23] <hou5ton> Jowi:   I wonder if it would play it?
[10:23] <noldon> Kingsqueak yes its a movie
[10:23] <grimboy> kevinG, It's the same as compiling anything. Get the source, read the README, make sure you have the requirements and follow what it says.
[10:23] <cntb> links clicked from IRC appear in konqueror Iwuold rather them appear on Firefox. HOW?
[10:23] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, /home/nolimitsoya/ogg2 (temporary directory for conversion) and on an xfs file system
[10:23] <grimboy> kevinG, You'll also need to apt-get build-essential.
[10:24] <Kingsqueak> noldon: how was that img file created?
[10:24] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Remember that when you convert to another format, no matter what the bitrate, you lose quality.
[10:24] <noldon> Kingsqueak no idea clonecd maybe
[10:24] <Riyonuk> didnt work T_T
[10:24] <grimboy> cntb,update-alternatives
[10:24] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, im aware of that, and willing to take that fall :) the rest of the archive is in flac from start
[10:24] <grimboy> cntb, (run it in the console/terminal)
[10:24] <cntb> ty grimboy trying that
[10:24] <Jowi> hou5ton, if you click on the help icon at the bottom of page you will see that it requires WMP 9 or higher. no realplayer requirement at all.
[10:25] <cntb> ty again
[10:25] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Oh good, flac == win
[10:25] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: But not sure about soundconverter
[10:25] <LGKeiz> A-MSG]  mIRC 6.21 is released http://mirc.com for more information!
[10:25] <Riyonuk> I get the error message --> Error 1529 while exucuting batch, Error 1529 Information mismatch in directory entry
[10:25] <hou5ton> Jowi:   Thanks .... I hadn't done that, obviously ...
[10:25] <hou5ton> Jowi:   Does anything on linux play that?
[10:25] <theblue> Hi all.
[10:25] <Jowi> hou5ton, no probs
[10:25] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, ok, im gonna have one more go with dbpoweramp in windows...
[10:26] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya: Good luck
[10:26] <noldon> Kingsqueak why would it mather if its a movie or something else
[10:26] <theblue> I remember a ncurses-based interface for the console in universe, it might have been called flin, has anyone heard of it?
[10:26] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, thank you :)
[10:26] <Kingsqueak> noldon: just trying to figure out if you are trying to make a DVD copy or burn an actual img file
[10:26] <noldon> ok
[10:26] <Kingsqueak> noldon: a straight rip of a movie wont copy for example
[10:26] <marcion> jbroome, ok I am downloading a 700MB image to try out one command ;(
[10:26] <noldon> ok
[10:26] <Kingsqueak> noldon: it won't fit on a DVD
=== elate1 is now known as elate
[10:27] <Kingsqueak> noldon: I'm not sure what your issue is though, try cdrecord from the commandline and see what the errors are if any
[10:27] <michael__> @theblue try google
[10:27] <cmweb> can any one help me out when i try to open a passworded rar file i get Could not perform the operation This archive is password protected. Please specify a password with the command: Edit->Password i kow the password but the instructions are wrong because the option is not clickable
[10:27] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya, still there?
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, yes i am :)
[10:27] <Stormx2> nolimitsoya, Audacity might do it
[10:27] <michael__> @theblue try google
[10:28] <nolimitsoya> Stormx2, ill check that out then. thank you :)
[10:28] <mwalling> when i attempt to access my local network over my wireless network, i get destination host unreachable. if i plug the computer into a cable connection, it works fine
[10:28] <Yawner> cmweb: open the file with the archive manager, then hit extract, then there should be a password input box.. (Im assuming that you are using the RAR package to do this..)
[10:28] <mwalling> any theorys?
[10:28] <michael__> @theblue try google
[10:28] <noldon> Kingsqueak strange cuz my dvds is 4.7gb
[10:28] <michael__> @theblue try google
[10:29] <Stormx2> michael__; Please don't write that again.
[10:29] <cmweb> Yawner, im not sure taht i am i  installed the one from the web and the one from a package
[10:29] <cntb> !alternatives
[10:29] <ubotu> To change the default applications system-wide, use 'sudo update-alternatives --all' in a terminal.
[10:29] <Jowi> cmeme, if file-roller does not prompt for a password, try in a terminal with "unrar"
[10:29] <sethk> noldon, there's a bit of overhead, but 4.5 gig should be a safe assumption
[10:29] <Jowi> cmweb, that last message was for you
[10:29] <Yawner> cmweb: which rar archiver did are you using? there is one from Synaptic called 'Rar' that adds in support for RAR files into the archive manager
[10:30] <wildchild> hello
[10:30] <wildchild> can someone help me with addons in firefox? I am looking for some kind of addon that when I click on the link http://www.koffice.org/krita/videos/krita_perspectivecloning.mpeg won't start kaffeine or other player but that I could have a choice to download this clip on HD
[10:30] <Yawner> or try what Jowi said
[10:30] <cmweb> Yawner, Im useing the one from the synaptic i guess ive installed two now
[10:30] <noldon> whats burning speed should i use when i burn dvds
[10:30] <mjr> a DVD is 4482 binary kilobytes, the 4.7 gig figure is decimal for greater market impressiviness
[10:30] <Yawner> cmweb: maybe.. you compiled one?
[10:30] <sethk> noldon, let it autodetect, unless you experience problems with the auto speed
[10:31] <cmweb> Yawner, yes
[10:31] <Yawner> cmweb: probably best to uninstall the compiled one and then reinstall the one from Synaptic
[10:31] <cmweb> Yawner, ive tryed sudo make uninstall but nothing
[10:31] <Yawner> hmm
[10:31] <sysdoc> wildchild, try rt clk on the link and choose 'save link as'
[10:32] <Yawner> cmweb: when you go into the archive manager can you unrar the file you want?
[10:32] <priccard> hey guys
[10:32] <Yawner> cmweb: was that the method you used before
[10:32] <cmweb> yawner, i can un rar files that are basic rar but not the passworded
[10:32] <grimboy> cmweb, What does it say about installation in the accompanying README?
[10:33] <cmweb> NOthing aout instaltion grimboy
[10:33] <Yawner> cmweb: you tried putting in a password into the Extract screen
[10:33] <cmweb> theis is not password box yawner

[10:34] <stucksam> hi all. I put a router (wrt54gl running open wrt) into client-bridge mode before i really knew what that was. Of course i can no longer contact the router through the web interface... is there a way to get back in touch with it?
[10:35] <cntb> !alternatives
[10:35] <ubotu> To change the default applications system-wide, use 'sudo update-alternatives --all' in a terminal.
[10:35] <cntb> ok is there a gui anyone built for alternatives ?
[10:35] <grimboy> stucksam, Use a pin to do the hard reset.
[10:35] <cmweb> yawner ive sent the readme to you
[10:35] <cntb> grimboy, ?
[10:36] <Yawner> cntb: yes through the Prefs Menu->Preferred Apps.
[10:36] <stucksam> grimboy is that the only way?
[10:36] <cntb> ty very much Yawner
[10:36] <stucksam> the router is on the roof in a waterproof box!
[10:36] <priccard> grimboy, kaffeine, mplayer, vlc, ogle (but it didn't run)
[10:36] <grimboy> stucksam, Uh, I don't know, it's the way I resolve things.

[10:42] <NineTeen67Comet> cmweb: Via cli how can I check on that server to make sure it's DNS is running?
[10:42] <Jowi> succari, read the help page. it depends on your hardware
[10:42] <cmweb> Im not sure try ssh
[10:42] <cmweb> yawner, where from
[10:42] <Yawner> london
[10:42] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: If your on a small network, you can put the system into the hosts file on all the other systems, otherwise you need to add it to your DNS which is probally running on whatever setup assigns ip addresses to your network if its automatic
[10:43] <grimboy> fuffe, You could always use a text editor with one built in like vim, emacs or that other one.
[10:43] <Terminus> Orby: well, most of the gnome media players nowadays use gstreamer.
[10:43] <succari> Jowi: i have a laptop toshiba satelltie a100-165

[10:43] <grimboy> fuffe, Or you could get even more unstable with filezilla's  http://filezilla-project.org/nightly.php nightly builds for linux.
[10:43] <zever> cmweb, if you try rar e foo.rar in command line?
[10:44] <NineTeen67Comet> H3g3m0n: non dhcp however .. all static ip addresses ..
[10:44] <zever> normally it will ask for password
[10:44] <grimboy> fuffe, Not built in sorry, it's one of those plugins.
[10:44] <Yawner> cmweb: aha.. my bad.. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[10:44] <Jowi> succari, that does not tell me anything. on the help page it is written if you even need install any additional driver. depends on which ati card you have.

[10:44] <nickv111> Hey. For some reason, whenever I have my microphone plugged into my computer, whatever goes into the microphone is played back on the speakers. I really don't want this to happen. How do I fix this?

[10:45] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: Might be worth setting up dhcp on the linksys then, should be fairly easy since most of those things have a nice webinterface

[10:45] <nickv111> constrictor: No, but then won't I not be able to use my microphone?
[10:45] <Yawner> cmweb: got there in the end lol
[10:45] <sal> Hey everyone! I have a beryl related question I was hoping someone could help me out
[10:45] <nickv111> I still want to use my microphone. I just don't want it to be played out of the speakers
[10:45] <grimboy> priccard_, Eek, are you running gnome?
[10:45] <Jowi> nickv111, in the volume control for the mic you will find one slider and two icons. one of those icons mutes the speaker output for the mic
[10:45] <kitche> b0ngo0: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[10:45] <priccard_> yes, with beryl
[10:46] <NineTeen67Comet> H3g3m0n: it was dhcp but it kept changing the addresses of the web/ftp server and since it only forwards ports by IP it was getting tiresome to check it all the time to make sure it hadn't changed the ip ..
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[10:46] <kitche> !nvidia|b0ngo0
[10:46] <ubotu> b0ngo0: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:46] <grimboy> priccard_, Ah, it's unlikely to work then.
[10:46] <OrgulloKmoore> is there a way to see the last few commands my computer ran before it was turned off?
[10:46] <priccard_> grimboy, what can i do about it?
[10:46] <constrictor> nickv11: if you double click on the volume control and then file->prefences you can select which output you want to mute but the input stays active
[10:46] <taz1> Help please, how to start ubuntu 6.1 from cd without getting out of range error on monitor? tia
[10:46] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: There should be a way to bind the ip addresses to specific hardware MAC addresses on your NIC's, you can then bind those ip addresses to hostnames
[10:46] <sal> How can I use the default human theme and icons after installing beryl? Cause after installing it I have this greyish theme with other icons and I prefer the default human theme
[10:47] <sig> sal go to preferences themes
[10:47] <Jowi> OrgulloKmoore, do you suspect that the terminal was used to type the commands?
[10:47] <H3g3m0n> sal: Check in the emeral theme manager, it should have a copy of the theme
[10:47] <sig> themes
[10:47] <OrgulloKmoore> Jowi> no...not history...
[10:47] <b0ng0> i previously used the nvidia-glx ones from Adept and beryl didnt work. had to get ones through automatix bleeder and i dont know what they were
[10:48] <NineTeen67Comet> H3g3m0n: aha .. never thunk'ed of that one .. lemme dig around a little .. I'm adding each box to each boxes /etc/hosts file too ..
[10:48] <constrictor> nickv11: yeah in capture you can click the little speaker icon to mute it coming out but sound will go in
[10:48] <grimboy> priccard_, Well the problem is that for some reason realplayer wants nautilus to handle the desktop and at the mo beryl is doing that. Solution, use vanilla gnome or somehow get nautilus to manage the desktop with beryl still running just for the duration of using realplayer.
[10:48] <sal> Yea I've gone to preferences> themes and selected the human theme, and I've selected the human theme in the emerald theme manager too, and I do have the orange Human borders around my windows, but it still has the other older icons, and the grey top and bottom bars
[10:48] <nickv111> constrictor: Where?
[10:48] <nickv111> constrictor: I can't find anywhere in KMix to edit the output of my microphone input
[10:49] <constrictor> oh my bad
[10:49] <kitche> b0ng0: it seems like the one's in the repo is not the newest stable release
[10:49] <constrictor> i assumed you were using gnome
[10:49] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: Its fairly painful to use static addresses, would never want to on a network with more than 2 or 3 systems, alternaticly if you carn't get it working on the linksys you could setup one of the servers to handle it but the linksys would be best since its handling everything anyway
[10:49] <priccard_> grimboy, wow, that sounds complicated.....
[10:49] <Jowi> OrgulloKmoore, well, you have logfiles in /var/log. I suggest auth.log and syslog first of all
[10:49] <NineTeen67Comet> H3g3m0n: true .. at home I run 5 boxes all static and they all work great .. then again they are all LINUX .. lol
[10:50] <grimboy> fuffe, Have you decided on what to use for ftp, personally I use svn for my websites, if your webhost has the option of it or cvs then I highly recommend.
[10:50] <priccard_> grimboy, but it wouldn't help if I use another player?
[10:50] <OrgulloKmoore> Jowi> thanks
[10:50] <ShadowBlack> hi
[10:50] <nickv111> Jowi: I've got to find my microphone control in the first place
[10:50] <NineTeen67Comet> H3g3m0n: I've got some direction right now thanks much .. I'll go tinker around in the linksys and see what it'll tell me ..
[10:50] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: It might be possible to setup the linksys to recieve the hostname with the dns querys also, although i couldnt on my dlink
[10:50] <taz1> Help please, how to start ubuntu 6.10 from cd without getting "out of range" error on monitor?
[10:50] <H3g3m0n> NineTeen67Comet: nps =P
[10:50] <grimboy> priccard_, Yeah, but you don't like the others (just out of interest why? I've found they're menu handling to be similar to a dvd player)
[10:50] <constrictor> is there a kubuntu channel? you might be able to get better help there
[10:51] <cz823> I'm looking to see if it's possible to read a drive formatted in FAT32?
[10:51] <Jowi> nickv111, in a terminal type "gnome-volume-control"
[10:51] <Kingsqueak> cz823: yup, write it too
[10:51] <Jowi> nickv111, then click on the Capture tab
[10:52] <nickv111> Jowi: I'm on Kubuntu
[10:52] <nickv111> Jowi: KMix
[10:52] <Kingsqueak> cz823: it isn't preferred unless it must be shared with Win, but it works
[10:52] <Jowi> nickv111, oh. no idea. :)
[10:52] <priccard_> grimboy, no I don't have any preferences but they didn't show a menu as well. So far I tried each player you suggested and none of them showed a menu. But I can play each video for his own....
[10:52] <nickv111> Jowi: Heh.
[10:52] <cmweb> Yawner, im still a little confused, do i do unrar -e -p e_P_H_2006___e_F_H_1.5.rar or what

[10:52] <Jowi> nickv111, I start to assume to much in my old age
[10:53] <sal> Is there a way to get my Human theme/icons back after installing beryl? I just installed it and I have an ugly grey bar at the top and bottom, and older icons, and I have tried going to preferences>themes and selecting human there, and in the emerald theme manager as well, but I only get the orange border around windows, the icons don't come back and neither the bars are still grey and stuff
[10:53] <mwalling> can someone help me with networking? i can access internal addresses (192.168.1.*) from a wired connection, but not from my wireless connection. both connections can access external sites fine (google.com)
[10:53] <Yawner> yes go into terminal and type.. unrar -e -p e_P_H_2006___e_F_H_1.5.rar
[10:53] <cz823> Kingsqueak: Yeah I need to get at the data on this drive before I reformat. The drive shows up on the computer, but it reads 0 bytes and I get an error when I try to open it: "mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1..."

[11:00] <sethk> EDinNY, you can also use synaptic to modify the sources list, which is probably easier for a new person to deal with
[11:00] <Yawner> cmweb: not really too sure what to recommend..
[11:00] <Kingsqueak> DjViper: if you exit with it running, it should just restart at next login, it's the 'sessions' options that govern that
[11:00] <fuffe> grimboy, ok, I decided to go back to nautilus..
[11:00] <pwuertz> hi, since edgy, my systems do not shut down anymore... one system reboots instead of powering down... another system does not power off... everything worked with dapper... any ideas why?

[11:04] <sethk> rBlong2us, you want an icon, not a symbolic link.  a sym link doesn't put anything on the desktop.
[11:04] <admin123> rBlong2us, why do you want to do that?
[11:04] <blanky> kelly_: did you get your gaim to work?
[11:04] <LjL> rBlong2us: yes that will give you the manual page for "ln", which is the command for making links
[11:04] <blanky> kelly_: what's psm?

[11:06] <sethk> klunk, you could do a server install and dump out the installed package list.

[11:06] <sethk> klunk, you can find that list on the server install cd, although I'd have to dig to figure out where.
[11:06] <cafuego> stork: Open the note and click "Delete".
[11:06] <LjL> cowuhsocky: yes, if that's not the kernel that you use
[11:06] <stork> cafuego, the delete button is blocked
[11:06] <knapp> blanky yes, it doesn't cover my problem. I have an "API mismatch problem"

[11:06] <klunk> sethk, I normally use synaptic so how can I dump the package list from apr-get or similar?
[11:06] <cowuhsocky> no i use the generic one
[11:06] <sethk> klunk, you can dump it with dpkg.
[11:06] <Kingsqueak> wite: if you selected the option upon install, yes
[11:07] <Yawner> rBlong2us: try...
[11:07] <knapp> blanky, I guess two drivers are installed and it has everything confused.
[11:07] <sethk> klunk, let me look at the dpkg options
[11:07] <gnomefreak> knapp: make sure the linux-restricted-modules package is for the kernel you are booted to
[11:07] <wce> i downloaded de nvidia driver from there website now how can i install it?

[11:07] <wite> Kingsqueek: Alright, what directory is it in?
[11:07] <gnomefreak> knapp: if your using the 9xxx series driver make sure you get the l-r-m package for them
[11:08] <Yawner> rBlong2us: cd ~/Desktop && sudo ln -s <directory you wish to link to..> <name of link>
[11:08] <Kingsqueak> wite: LAMP is an abbreviation for Linux Apache MySQL and Php, they install in various places
[11:08] <compengi> gnomefreak, hey
[11:08] <Yawner> rBlong2us: try that from the terminal
[11:08] <Kingsqueak> wite: try /var/www for apache as an example
[11:08] <wite> Ah
[11:08] <wite> What about MySQL
[11:08] <gnomefreak> compengi: hi
[11:08] <wite> ?
[11:08] <rBlong2us> Yawner: thanks
[11:08] <Kingsqueak> wite: you'll have to look around, honestly if you "need" LAMP, you should already know all this
[11:09] <knapp> gnomefreak l-r-m to the latest version
[11:09] <knapp> is *
[11:09] <Yawner> rBlong2us: it works?
[11:09] <Kingsqueak> wite: no offense to you, but tons of people are obsessively installing LAMP lately, I'm not sure why as most don't have any idea what it is or why they would want it.

[11:09] <compengi> gnomefreak, my friend needs a help concerning installing ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 with HyperMemory driver and he is a new ubuntu user, can you afford it?
[11:09] <Luke> is the beryl website down or is it just me?
[11:09] <Samus_Aran> can someone explain this: The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: php5 libapache2-mod-php5
[11:09] <Yawner> rBlong2us: you may need to make the link yours now and not roots..
[11:09] <knapp> gnomefreak, it does
[11:09] <Samus_Aran> why is php5 no longer a valid package ?
[11:09] <sethk> klunk, apt-cache dump looks interesting.
[11:10] <Yawner> rBlong2us: sudo chown <your username>.<your group> <name of link>
[11:10] <compengi> gnomefreak, he is now installing sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx as in the guide is this correct till now?
[11:10] <cowuhsocky> ok LjL one last thing, do i only need to remove the Linux-image-2.6.17-10-386? or do i need to remove everything related to 386 in the package manager
[11:10] <Kingsqueak> wite: what made you think you needed LAMP?
[11:10] <klunk> sethk, woah loads of output
[11:11] <wite> Kingsqueek: Windows port was easy, figured LAMP would have everything I needed
[11:11] <sethk> klunk, I think if you grep for 'Package:'   you'll get what you want
[11:11] <LjL> cowuhsocky: i'm guessing the related stuff will be removed automatically, but if it doesn't, it should be safe to remove it. just don't remove anything that's related to your current kernel (which is -generic i suppose)
[11:11] <Kingsqueak> wite: ahh migrating from an existing install
[11:11] <rBlong2us> Yawner: it works as user ln -s no need to sudo
[11:11] <gnomefreak> knapp: please paste the output of the following commands in pastebin. apt-cache policy nvidia-glx  uname -r
[11:11] <Kingsqueak> wite: that makes more sense, take a look at the startup scripts in /etc/init.d/ for apache and mysql, they should reference the install dirs
[11:11] <wite> Kingsqueek: yes, I just need to know where to put all the database files
[11:12] <wite> Thanks, will do
[11:12] <Yawner> rBlong2us: aha ok, wasnt sure if the directory you were linking to was protected or not.. (not sure if that matters or not actually)
[11:12] <klunk> sethk, that looks great, thanks
[11:12] <Kingsqueak> wite: it may be /var/mysql but I'm not positive with the ubuntu packages
[11:12] <we2by> what to install to get X development files?
[11:12] <wite> KingSqueek: it's not
[11:12] <cowuhsocky> LjL: im just afraid that if i remove one of the things it might affect my -generic kernel because the 386 simply came out of no where. Yesterday upon installing beryl it showed up in my boot-selections
[11:13] <Kingsqueak> wite: give me a sec, I'll find a link
[11:13] <wite> Thanks

[11:17] <bruenig> h00t, don't think so. I have never used one. I know you can do winecfg and there is a nice little graphical configuration thing, but generally the wine whatever.exe is used to launch things. I think also that you can just double click exes or right click open with wine, not certain on that though

[11:31] <MrGiMmE> Make sure that you have compiled Qt with thread support!
[11:31] <bruenig> ha, I do the same thing everytime I open a terminl
[11:31] <we2by> how do I patch a file?
[11:31] <dragonfyre13> bruenig: hehe.
[11:31] <Kingsqueak> savvas: there's also 'id3' and 'id3tool'
[11:31] <we2by> I have a .patch here
[11:31] <cafuego> bltgurl: The long and short of it is, your card will work fine after you install http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/edgy-cafuego/bcm43xx/bcm43xx-firmware_1.3-1ubuntu2_all.deb
[11:32] <dragonfyre13> anyone have an idea why network manager would not be recognising that I have wireless?
[11:32] <MrGiMmE> dragon does it recognize your wireless card?
[11:32] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: likely the driver isn't loaded for your card
[11:33] <hentai> I have two mics on my computer. How can I change the one that records to the one on my headset?
[11:33] <dragonfyre13> None of my wireless utilities on the gui will work, but modifying the /etc/network/interfaces and then doing ifdown and ifup will work.

[11:34] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: nm-applet doesn't like other wireless systems running, if you have wifi-radar running etc. it will interfere, also /etc/network/interfaces must be commented out so that only the 'lo' interface is there, then reboot and try again

[11:39] <rBlong2us> haaa yeas
[11:40] <Paddy_EIRE> hou5ton: yeah it works, it seems they use there own player maybe you are blocking the content in some way??
[11:40] <bruenig> irssi wasn't installed. They must have removed it from default edgy
[11:40] <bruenig> unless I uninstalled it for whatever reason, don't see why I would have but perhaps
[11:41] <rBlong2us> hi
[11:41] <rBlong2us> kewl
[11:41] <rBlong2us> this is much faste
[11:41] <rBlong2us> for christ sake
[11:41] <Flannel> bruenig: hmm, it does appear it's no longer in u-d, that's... unfortunate.
[11:42] <rBlong2us> I think the computing utopia would be for a society using computers only with CLI
[11:42] <bruenig> well if you don't have internet, you can't irc. If you do have internet, you can easily sudo apt-get install irssi.
[11:43] <Paddy_EIRE> !irssi
[11:43] <ubotu> irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )

[11:43] <Himura> can someone paste his /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[11:43] <Flannel> bruenig: if you don't have X, and don't know what IRC clients there are, you won't know how to get irssi.  On edgy, what does "irc" start (in a terminal?)
[11:44] <hou5ton> Paddy_EIRE:   I'm looking for that possibility, but can't find where I might be blocking anything.   Any suggestions?
[11:44] <Kingsqueak> Flannel: irssi here, but I removed epic4 and BitchX
[11:44] <Paddy_EIRE> hou5ton: do u use anything like "noscript" or "Adblock"
[11:44] <rBlong2us> bruenig: on my GUIbuntu install irssi wasn't there for as default
[11:44] <Flannel> Kingsqueak: On edgy?  You've installed irssi though.  That's not default, apparently.
[11:44] <hentai> how do i see what sound devices i have plugged in? i know /dev/dsp works, but i'm trying to get something out of my headset.
[11:45] <sn00p|> how do I fix my ident in ubuntu?
[11:45] <Kingsqueak> Flannel: yeah I don't even know anymore , I've installed an awful lot, irssi is early on the list

[11:45] <Celldweller> a midi keyboard
[11:46] <Celldweller> ?

[11:46] <Paddy_EIRE> ?
[11:47] <hou5ton> Paddy_EIRE:   yes
[11:47] <rBlong2us> I don't get it, Totem use xine or gstreamer?

[11:55] <Luke> how do I remove something from my gnome-session without deleting the whole thing? I tried editing ~/.gnome2/session but it seemed to just be the default session
[11:55] <CharlieSu> bruenig: do you use it?
[11:55] <XiXaQ> Seveas, I'm downloading it. Thanks. :)
[11:55] <bruenig> CharlieSu, once, then I wimped out and went back to graphical
[11:55] <hou5ton> Paddy_EIRE:   already have that installed
[11:56] <CharlieSu> bruenig: when you used it, did you just use libtorent?
[11:56] <Flannel> MrGiMmE: installing a deb? why not use apt-get?
[11:56] <Paddy_EIRE> hou5ton: ok, this is a weird one.... I wonder what could be missing
[11:56] <bruenig> yeah that is what I meant, I used libtorrent
[11:56] <MrGiMmE> Because the repository isnt working
[11:56] <MrGiMmE> It cant connect to it
[11:56] <CharlieSu> bruenig: i didn't know libtorrent could be accessed directly.. i thought u needed rtorrent..
[11:56] <Flannel> MrGiMmE: which repository?
[11:56] <bruenig> CharlieSu, it was a long time ago perhaps I am confused

[11:57] <hou5ton> Paddy_EIRE:   yes .... I'm looking for everything ... YouTube works great
[11:57] <SeAofSaRo> how do I get read/write permissions on my local drives?
[11:57] <bimberi> Luke: System -> Preferences -> Sessions, Startup Programs tab ?
[11:57] <hou5ton> CNN works great
[11:57] <XiXaQ> Seveas, perhaps you could create links on http://free.linux.hp.com/~brett/seveas/freenx/ ?
[11:57] <Luke> bimberi: dont have X working
[11:58] <Flannel> MrGiMmE: ask in #ubuntu-xgl, they might know of a mirror, or whatever.  But, libqt3-mt-dev isn't in that repository, it's in main.
[11:58] <CharlieSu> bruenig: yeah.. libtorrent is what rtorrent uses.. libtorrent is just the libraries for it i believe
[11:58] <GionnyBoss> I noticed that with Ubuntu 6.10 there is not the ' esddsp ' command... I used it to launch skype on FC6 and it worked fine... why isn't there this command? can anybody please tell me which one is the best way to run skype on Ubuntu 6.10 with the best audio quality, please? thanks
[11:58] <Luke> MrGiMmE: go to #beryl ... the main server is down
[11:58] <Luke> MrGiMmE: there is an alternate repo for ubuntu
[11:58] <hou5ton> Paddy_EIRE:   I even got video to work on MSNBC
[11:58] <bimberi> Luke: ah
[11:58] <sethk> that's just a standard KDE component, it shouldn't be hard to install (libqt3-mt-dev, that is)
[11:58] <MrGiMmE> There is?
[11:59] <Luke> yes
[11:59] <MrGiMmE> I see
