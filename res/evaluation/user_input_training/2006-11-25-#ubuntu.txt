[12:01] <bruenig> !enter
[12:01] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[12:01] <micktm> sethk: it's a ? in a black rumble...
[12:01] <kevin> brainsforsale, what is your problem
[12:01] <Jowi> sybariten, sudo lsof -i tcp:21
[12:01] <sethk> micktm, try doing the ls in a console (one of the virtual consoles, which you get to with control-alt-f1, control-alt-f2, etc.)
[12:01] <sn9> sybariten: most machines don't, since ftp is relatively useless
[12:01] <brainsforsale> 766 mhz proccesor
=== naholyr_ is now known as naholyr
[12:01] <brainsforsale> 100 somethin ram
[12:01] <ortega10> i need a good bittorrent client other than azureus (that lately refuses to work properly), any suggestions?
[12:01] <bruenig> brainsforsale, you probably should use xubuntu
[12:01] <anton_> sn9: i use ftp all the time when i have to talk to a windows box :)
[12:01] <brainsforsale> asnd 6gb of drive sapce
[12:01] <sybariten> sn9: yeah i used to have one i think, but i was in a hurry to set one up now on this ubuntu machine
[12:01] <sethk> micktm, either way  :)  the point is that the filename is actually what you specified, it is just being displayed incorrectly, which should be easier to fix than if the name weren't correct as stored.
[12:01] <brainsforsale> im downloading ubuntu
[12:02] <kevin> ya, good idea brainsforsale
[12:02] <brainsforsale> but i want to know if this will work
[12:02] <kevin> look at system req.
[12:02] <sn9> anton_: put putty on the windows box and be done. if you can't do that, samba is still less headache in the long run
[12:02] <navyseal_> bruenig can help me with a printer?
[12:02] <bruenig> brainsforsale, it will probably boot, not sure of how fun it will be to use. Take a look at this: http://xubuntu.org/
[12:02] <micktm> no, I can't understand how can I solve the problem...
[12:02] <hikenboot> how does one renumber the ethernet ports so that a removed nic card which is on eth0 can be replaced by the one on eth1?
[12:03] <bruenig> navyseal_, probably not. To install my printer I just kept clicking next on the printer install dialog and it worked.
[12:03] <sethk> micktm, which console program are you using?  are you in gnome, or kde?
[12:03] <micktm> gnome
[12:03] <anton_> sesamebike: how large is /dev/hda?
[12:03] <micktm> sethk: gnome
[12:03] <sesamebike> anton_: 20490559488 bytes
[12:03] <kitche> hikenboot: when you remove a nic the one that is still in your computer will becomd eth0
[12:03] <anton_> sn9: a whole samba server to talk to the windows world?
[12:03] <rebuilt> brainsforsale, you are well above minimum system requirements
[12:04] <hikenboot> well it didnt so that cant be right
[12:04] <brainsforsale> great
[12:04] <anton_> sesamebike: and how  large is the image you're making now?
[12:04] <navyseal_> bruenig yep i tryed to, but when i select the model button "next" disapears :S
[12:04] <sn9> tengo: there must be some other kind of screwup somewhere in xorg.conf
[12:04] <brainsforsale> xubuntu looks great
[12:04] <sethk> micktm, try running xterm, and doing an ls from there.  just start xterm from the console, then do ls in the xterm window
[12:04] <brainsforsale> but im trying to build a pvr
[12:04] <brainsforsale> can anyone help me?
[12:04] <sn9> anton_: that's why putty is preferable
[12:04] <kevin> good, brainsforsale, take it and download it
[12:04] <anton_> sesamebike: ps. can you give me the size with -h ?
[12:04] <micktm> ok
[12:04] <GenNMX> hikenboot: As said before, hotplug should handle it.
[12:04] <tengo> if i enable the 1024x768 resolution in 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg', it does the looping process sn9
[12:04] <sesamebike> anton_: 4062691328 bytes and increasing. I'm just about to do a control-c
[12:04] <solo> where can i get the repository with bcm43xx-fwcutter   in a full out PKG that i can transfer to a machine with no internet???????
[12:04] <ctkroeker> Has anyone had any luck with skype on an ltsp client? referring to sound
[12:04] <micktm> ok, then...?
[12:04] <micktm> sethk: ok, then...?
[12:05] <brainsforsale> im looking for help with either mythtv
[12:05] <rebuilt> brainsforsale, you should try knopmyth if you want a pvr os
[12:05] <brainsforsale> or sagetv
[12:05] <sethk> micktm, what did you see?  where the accented character should be, what is displayed?
[12:05] <lucien> are there 3rd party repositories with newer wpa_supplicant & NetworkManager than in edgy?
[12:05] <kevin> solo, is the machine on a network or salone
[12:05] <sn9> solo: oh, the machine has no other internet? that's different
[12:05] <brainsforsale> yea
[12:05] <brainsforsale> i looked at that
[12:05] <brainsforsale> but i have a question
[12:05] <anton_> sesamebike: hang on, i managed to work out, that the image is not 40GB large. how large is dev/hda again?
[12:05] <solo> sn9 i told u that!    and yes no internet
[12:05] <solo> its on a lan
[12:05] <solo> but both LAN and wLAN   hardware are broadcom
[12:05] <micktm> sethk: I see ?
[12:05] <sn9> solo: lemme get you a direct download url for the .deb file then
[12:05] <solo> so i cant get drivers off net for net hardware
[12:05] <solo> thank you sn9
[12:05] <solo> thank you
[12:06] <sethk> micktm, it looks the same, you mean?
[12:06] <brainsforsale> im a little confused about the pvr card
[12:06] <brainsforsale> im looking to hook it up to my comcast digital cable box
[12:06] <micktm> sethk: I see L?EME:TXT
[12:06] <sn9> solo: broadcom ethernet should work out-of-the-box with no download
[12:06] <sethk> try bringing up the file (the one we created before with hexdump) in an gui editor.
[12:06] <sesamebike> anton_: 20.4 GB
[12:06] <brainsforsale> will i be able to change channels with my computer
[12:06] <brainsforsale> ?
[12:06] <anton_> sesamebike: that's wierd
[12:06] <ortega10> i need a good bittorrent client other than azureus (that lately refuses to work properly), any suggestions ?
[12:06] <kevin> brainsforsale, there is this really easy OS that anyone with no time on there hands can use, its called windoze
[12:06] <hikenboot> sorry to say GenNMX my host is living proof that it doesnt renumber them
[12:06] <odes> how do i activate my wlan?
[12:07] <anton_> sesamebike: or is it weird? on /dev/hda you have the current rootfs?
[12:07] <kevin> odes, what wlan card do u have
[12:07] <brainsforsale> kevin, will this help my pvr problem?
[12:07] <sesamebike> anton_: indeed. i'll abort it now and try again. it seems it's not finding EOF.
[12:07] <odes>  Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG
[12:07] <kevin> windoze has many pvr apps online if u luk hard enough
[12:08] <solo> so sn9    if i hard wire the ubuntu machine to the net i can setup and install the repositorys?
[12:08] <anton_> sesamebike. i'm not sure that's the problem. if you currently have your / on /dev/hda, then /dev/sda will also be mounted somewhere on /dev/hda
[12:08] <micktm> sethk: sorry, L?EME.TXT
[12:08] <kevin> i mdont no if 43xx worx w intel chips
[12:08] <brainsforsale> kevin, but do you know about my pvr card
[12:08] <noobie0057> when I run "gksu disks-admin" I get an error message "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file."  I just rebooted from updating my computer.
[12:08] <sesamebike> anton_: ahh. that could be aproblem
[12:08] <kevin> what card do u have
[12:08] <brainsforsale> about hooking it up to a DCT2224 comcast digital cable box
[12:08] <anton_> sesamebike: and you're copying a copy of a copy etc
[12:08] <brainsforsale> i havent bought one
[12:08] <sesamebike> anton_: is there any way around this
[12:08] <brainsforsale> but i was looking at the pvr-150
[12:08] <kevin> does ur pc have a built in input
[12:08] <anton_> sesamebike: a live cd :)
[12:09] <sn9> solo: yes. that's what i originally thought you were doing
[12:09] <kevin> from whom
[12:09] <solo> ok
[12:09] <brainsforsale> hauppauge
[12:09] <lane> Anything fun I can do with my new 64-bit machine with Ubuntu on it?
[12:09] <rebuilt> thats the best card to have
[12:09] <lane> Anything fun I can do with my new 64-bit machine with Ubuntu-server on it?*
[12:09] <sesamebike> anton_: i'm running with the live cd already. /dev/hda is not mounted
[12:09] <anton_> lane: you can write assembly code with movq :)
[12:09] <brainsforsale> it looked good
[12:09] <odes> is there a command lite somtething eth1
[12:09] <sethk> micktm, run the "locale" command (no arguments) and tell me the first line, which should say LANG=XXXXX    tell me what the XXXXX is
[12:09] <brainsforsale> but does anyone know about the cable box?
[12:09] <tengo> does anyone know why i can't change my screen resolution to 1024x768 without it looping?
[12:10] <anton_> sesamebike: ooh, well, then i don't understand why it doesn't work...
[12:10] <rebuilt> your system should be ok, processor is fast enough, you may need a little more memory.  The video card is the best you can get for a linux pvr
[12:10] <micktm> sethk: it_IT.UTF-8
[12:10] <noobie0057> Hello, I'm getting an error message  "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file."
[12:10] <sn9> solo: but if you want to sneakernet a file over, here it is: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/bcm43xx-fwcutter/bcm43xx-fwcutter_20060501-5_i386.deb
[12:10] <rebuilt> it will do mpeg processing right on the card, no need for processor work
[12:10] <sethk> micktm, ok, that's correct.
[12:10] <sesamebike> anton_: me neither. i'll try with specifing exacly how many bytes to copy. thanks anyway
[12:11] <brainsforsale> yea
[12:11] <sethk> let me check something
[12:11] <brainsforsale> i read that
[12:11] <lane> anton_, I'll get right on that
[12:11] <micktm> sethk: and so?
[12:11] <sethk> micktm, I'm thinking
[12:11] <brainsforsale> but i need to know if I will be able to use it to change channels on comcast digital cable
[12:11] <tengo> what screen resolution is everyone at right now?
[12:11] <micktm> sethk: ok :) sorry
[12:11] <solo> thank you sn9,  using sneakernet terms???  wow...    *tips my hat*
[12:11] <rebuilt> and yes you will be able to connect it to your cable service, and change the channels
[12:11] <sn9> tengo: 1024x768
[12:11] <sethk> micktm, I'm tempted to say try KDE, which by reputation has better internationalization, but you could do a lot of installing and end up exactly where you already are.
[12:12] <rebuilt> you can also schedule times to record and other fancy smansy things
[12:12] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: Just not for channels above 99
[12:12] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:12] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: For that, you'd need an IR Blaster.
[12:12] <kevin> brainsforsale, it is called winTV, so use it with windoze
[12:12] <brainsforsale> so i connect the card to the cable
[12:12] <brainsforsale> box
[12:12] <micktm> sethk: I tries kde.... If I remember well... I had the same problem!
[12:12] <brainsforsale> on its coax out
[12:12] <brainsforsale> and i can change channels?
[12:12] <rebuilt> yes
[12:12] <brainsforsale> and is there some way to split it?
[12:12] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: No, it can't change channels on the cable box, you need an IR Blaster for that.
[12:12] <brainsforsale> so i can watch regular tv
[12:13] <tengo> damn resolution problem
[12:13] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:13] <brainsforsale> so
[12:13] <c_lisp> hey why is the reboot in the sbin on ubuntu
[12:13] <sethk> micktm, I'm not sure what to do.  as I said, the probably is relatively minor, because the name looks like it is stored correctly.
[12:13] <sethk> micktm, let me think again.
[12:13] <c_lisp> is it save for me to change the privs and put it in the reg bin?
[12:13] <kevin> tengo 915resolution in synapic
[12:13] <GenNMX> rebuilt: Why are you telling him a card can change channels on an external cable BOX?
[12:13] <brainsforsale> if i set something up to record on the linux box on mythtv, it will be able to change the channel by itself
[12:13] <timo90> brainsforsale:Do you have a mce remote
[12:13] <sn9> brainsforsale: if a cable box has a serial port, channels may be changed that way
[12:13] <hexion> hello
[12:14] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:14] <noobie0057> Hi I'm getting:  Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file. ?
[12:14] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: If you want the card to change channels, you need to connect the cable directly to the card
[12:14] <tengo> kevin what is it?
[12:14] <brainsforsale> a serial port is?
[12:14] <brainsforsale> sorry
[12:14] <Hoagie> Hi all. I'm trying to set up a BT Voyager 105 modem. The only detailed HOWTO I can find was for 5.10. Is there anywhere I can find a more up to date HOWTO, or should I just take my chances?
[12:14] <brainsforsale> but im kinda in the dark about all of this
[12:14] <hexion> I have problems with sound in edgy... without any cause, it doesn't work. Anyone can help me? :(
[12:14] <timo90> brainsforsale:We akll were once
[12:14] <GenNMX> Comcast's cable box is tiny, it has no extra ports. The HD / DVR box DOES have a serial and firewire port
[12:14] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:15] <brainsforsale> but don't i need the cable box to decrypt it
[12:15] <brainsforsale> or is that not true
[12:15] <brainsforsale> Z?
[12:15] <ikonia> ok - I have the vob files form my dvd thanks to dvdrip, is it better to encode the whole thing then strip the audio, or take the audio direct from the vobs ?
[12:15] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: But your best bet is an IR Blaster if you want to use the Cable Box
[12:15] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: Only for channels above 99
[12:15] <timo90> brainsforsale:yes, but the signal will be connected to you pvr card
[12:15] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:15] <GhoSt_DoG> how i install for mozilla ?
[12:15] <brainsforsale> so
[12:15] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: Channels below 99, "Basic Cable", do not need the cable box
[12:15] <DreamerHxC> hi all
[12:16] <GhoSt_DoG> how i install plugins for mozilla ?
[12:16] <sn9> brainsforsale: are you on the east coast? if so, your box is probably from Scientific Atlanta, which i know nothing about, since i'm on the west coast, where everything is Motorola
[12:16] <brainsforsale> i can just take the coax straight out of the wall into the card
[12:16] <brainsforsale> ?
[12:16] <timo90> GhoSt_DoG: what plug in ?
[12:16] <GenNMX> sn9: HD / DVR boxes are Motorolla
[12:16] <GhoSt_DoG> i have mplayer
[12:16] <brainsforsale> i have the DCT2224
[12:16] <GenNMX> sn9: East or West coast
[12:16] <timo90> brainsforsale:you need a tuner card for that
[12:16] <brainsforsale> east
[12:16] <GhoSt_DoG> and i want see one movie > www.tvtuga.com
[12:16] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:16] <brainsforsale> so i get the pvr-150 tuner card
[12:16] <GhoSt_DoG> but i dont see because i dont have plugins :-s
[12:16] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: OK, that's a Motorolla, that should at least have a firewire port
[12:17] <brainsforsale> i can connect the directly to the coax coming out of the wall?
[12:17] <brainsforsale> it doesn't
[12:17] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: Yes.
[12:17] <brainsforsale> its black
[12:17] <brainsforsale> thank god
[12:17] <GenNMX> Oh, then that's the tiny model, right.
[12:17] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:17] <brainsforsale> one last thing
[12:17] <sigmund> Hey.
[12:17] <kober> Hey, I'm trying to connect to a wireless network that provides the WEP key for you and i'm pretty sure its having trouble with the 2 way eap-mschap-2 authentication hand shake but I have no idea if there is a way to fix it in linux
[12:17] <brainsforsale> is there some way to split that
[12:17] <brainsforsale> so i can get my regular tv the the cable box
[12:18] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: It's called, of all amazing terminology, a splitter!
[12:18] <brainsforsale> and the cable will also go to my tuner card
[12:18] <timo90> brainsforsale:two card will sort that out
[12:18] <zPm> hi, i try to listen mp3s on my smb-share, i allready installed gnome-vfs, libgnome-vfs-common and all sama packetes but i could still only browse the share but not listen to one file
[12:18] <brainsforsale> so
[12:18] <brainsforsale> i get a splitter
[12:18] <timo90> brainsforsale:A spiter will do it too
[12:18] <sn9> brainsforsale: most of the cheap splitters can mess up cable box signals
[12:18] <brainsforsale> i put that inbetween my wall and my cable box
[12:19] <brainsforsale> my regular wall to cable box goes on one side of the splitter
[12:19] <timo90> brainsforsale:thats why i  said get two card
[12:19] <brainsforsale> and wall to tuner card pvr-150
[12:19] <sgirc> sn9: Is your /etc/ppp/options file untouched since your ubuntu install ?
[12:19] <brainsforsale> goes on the other sidde
[12:19] <timo90> a splitter can degrade the quality
[12:19] <sn9> sgirc: probably
[12:19] <brainsforsale> timo90: by how much?
[12:19] <dRk_sHd0w> Im new 2 linux and have been reading information on installing .tar.gz programs but cant figure it out can smeone please help me
[12:19] <Hoagie> Where does a file have to be to install it from the terminal?
[12:19] <timo90> ENgought to pee you off
[12:19] <regeya> already having second thoughts about replacing the antiquated os9+asip setup at work with an ubuntu lts setup + netatalk.  one can split resource forks on hfs+ under os x, copy the data over to a native partition, share it via netatalk...but adouble:osx isn't recommended, and v2 isn't os x-friendly if you try to move over, and if you don't like that, it's apple's fault that they don't implement their own spec so complain to appl
[12:20] <CiberSkull> Hi, recently my windows partition crached and i had to reinstall...i'm using the ubuntu livecd to try to configure grub to be the boot loader but i don't know how to do it...do you know any document or something that could help me? thanks
[12:20] <sgirc> sn9: could you make it available on the paste server so that I can see what is wrong with my file ?
[12:20] <sn9> brainsforsale: if you want your pvr-150 to get channels above 99, get a separate cable box just for it
[12:20] <kitche> dRk_sHd0w: .tar.gz is usually source files tarred and gziped
[12:20] <timo90> dRk_sHd0w: what would you like tyo install
[12:20] <brainsforsale> no
[12:20] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: If you want to watch TV and record, you need either a TV itself or another tuner card. You can just buy a cheap tuner card that doesn't have hardware recording capabilities, they go for as little as $40. You'll need a splitter regardless.
[12:20] <brainsforsale> sn9: i dont need chanells above 99
[12:20] <dRk_sHd0w> im trying to install winrar archiver
[12:20] <foxure> My home partion is located on a NFS system, The problem that Media players like mplayer, xmms and amarok can't play files from NFS.. how do i add support?
[12:20] <timo90> dRk_sHd0w: In then softweare you are install ing there are always instructions of how to do it
[12:21] <brainsforsale> ok
[12:21] <dRk_sHd0w> I looked and there wasn't any
[12:21] <kevin> dRk_sHd0w try using only files that end in .deb  they install very easily
[12:21] <brainsforsale> im thinking of buying a hauppauge pvr-150 off ebay
[12:21] <brainsforsale> will that be a good tuner card?
[12:22] <timo90> brainsforsale: if you do buy a tunner card you wont need a spliter
[12:22] <DekKeD> I am trying Beryl and all my Windows have no borders and no titlebar. Any fix?
[12:22] <kevin> brainsforsale your card will work fine in WINDOZ!
[12:22] <dRk_sHd0w> is there a good tutorial around to learn how to install .tar's
[12:22] <sn9> brainsforsale: if you don't want the digital channels, get an old analog tuner card and hook the cable to it directly from the splitter
[12:22] <timo90> One card connects to the other for the signal
[12:22] <GenNMX> timo90: That's if the cards have OUT
[12:22] <dRk_sHd0w> im very new 2 linux and dont understand to much
[12:22] <timo90> dRk_sHd0w:Google is the best place about installing
[12:23] <brainsforsale> timo90:
[12:23] <brainsforsale> thaqt could work
[12:23] <brainsforsale> but
[12:23] <timo90> GenNMX:they all do these days
[12:23] <bunnythebunny> dRk_sHd0w, wait i'll try to get you one
[12:23] <brainsforsale> wouldnt it be easier to just split it
[12:23] <timo90> ITS RF out
[12:23] <brainsforsale> and leave one side with my tv like it is
[12:23] <zPm> DekKeD is your xgl setup working?
[12:23] <kevin> brainsforsale: cable or satitite tv
[12:23] <timo90> xgl rocks
[12:23] <brainsforsale> cable
[12:24] <brainsforsale> comcast digital cable
[12:24] <kevin> digital or anolog?
[12:24] <brainsforsale> digital
[12:24] <Nookie^> anyone got ati driver to work in edgy?
[12:24] <noobie0057> Hi I just updated and I'm getting "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file."
[12:24] <DekKeD> zPm: All efects work, just no titlebars and borders
[12:24] <bunnythebunny> dRk_shd0w, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format) <--  you can also type in a terminal man tar, or info tar, or tar --help
[12:24] <timo90> GenNMX:Unless he gets the cheep stuff
[12:24] <dRk_sHd0w> thanks
[12:24] <kevin> alright, when u change the channel on the TV, the channel will also change in the pvr
[12:24] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: You know, Comcast has a DVR setup for $15/month. If you think of paying $90 to $100 for your TV Tuner card, and setting it up, etc., I don't think it's such a big deal. The Comcast DVR box is a Dual Tuner, meaning you can watch TV and record at the same time, and has a firewire port with both Windows and Linux drivers, so you can transfer off the box to your HDD if you want.
[12:25] <mborohov> hey guys
[12:25] <mborohov> i have a quick question
[12:25] <Hoagie> Hey. Where do I put a file to be able to install it from the terminal?
[12:25] <mborohov> so my sound works fine when using a player to play a movie or sound file
[12:25] <brainsforsale> well
[12:25] <DreamerHxC> Need help; when I do glxinfo | grep vendor I get "Error: unable to open display (null)"
[12:25] <mborohov> but it doesnt work when using say, gaim, or the gnome sound preferences
[12:25] <tengo> kevin, how do you work the 915resolution thing
[12:25] <sn9> sgirc: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33766/
[12:25] <brainsforsale> that means the linux box pays for itself in less than a year
[12:25] <kevin> do u have an intel card?
[12:25] <DreamerHxC> me?
[12:26] <kevin> no, tengo
[12:26] <mborohov> anyone have any ideas?
[12:26] <tengo> kevin,  huh?
[12:26] <timo90> Hoagie: cd /home/*your user name?/Desktop/
[12:26] <noobie0057> The bug I'm having might affect more users that just myself..
[12:26] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: Except the Linux box doesn't do HD or any other newer format ;) With leasing, you get the latest technology. Personally, I would wait until on the Linux box until the cable companies and Tuner cards come out with CableCard-ready, so you don't need a cable box, period.
[12:26] <Quinn_Storm> all you should need to do is install 915resolution
[12:26] <sn9> GenNMX: you obviously haven't actually dealt with the comcast dvr's
[12:26] <kevin> what version is your video card, say intel 945GM
[12:26] <tengo> quinn_storm, then i should try chaning teh resolution?
[12:26] <brainsforsale> well
[12:26] <brainsforsale> i could get an hd tuner card
[12:27] <GenNMX> sn9: I've had one for a year and a half
[12:27] <Farm_Fresh> how is XGL coming along?
[12:27] <Quinn_Storm> tengo: I think so yeah, or restarting
[12:27] <DreamerHxC> Need help; when I do glxinfo | grep vendor I get "Error: unable to open display (null)"
[12:27] <zPm> DekKeD hum so you started the beryl-manager? maybe something's wrong with the emerald settings
[12:27] <hexion> my sound card has stop working suddenly, please anybody can help me?
[12:27] <GenNMX> brainsforsale: HD Tuner Cards are just for HD signals over the air, not from a cable provider
[12:27] <brainsforsale> good point
[12:27] <brainsforsale> well\
[12:27] <brainsforsale> i dont get hd
[12:27] <sn9> GenNMX: as for the cablecard, i think TiVo has that today, and that's linux
[12:27] <brainsforsale> so it doenst matter
[12:27] <kevin> hexion try reintalling the drive or even ubuntu if u have to
[12:27] <mborohov> my sound card works, but only when im playing a movie or audio file
[12:27] <hexion> kevin how do I do that?
[12:28] <GenNMX> sn9: True, but TiVo is expensive
[12:28] <noobie0057> Hi I just updated and I'm getting "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file."
=== sigmund is now known as oneortheother
[12:28] <kevin> hexion did the sound work when u first installed linux?
[12:28] <sn9> GenNMX: according to your own price quote of comcast, it's cheaper than comcast dvr service
[12:28] <timo90> mborohov:Check the oudio settings on you player settings
[12:29] <hexion> kevin, yes and it work too in my other partition and live cd... it stoped working today... without any reason
[12:29] <tengo> kevin, 915resolution didn't work
[12:29] <kevin> tengo, what video card do u have?
[12:29] <hexion> kevin, and I don't know what can I do... how do I reconfigure my sound, or modprobe some module... :(
[12:29] <Nukez> hu
[12:29] <tengo> kevin, nvidia geforce 4
[12:29] <noobie0057> kevin, tengo, bransforsale: no offense but I'm going to block you.
[12:30] <GenNMX> sn9: $15/month includes HD channels
[12:30] <Nukez> does anyone know how to add files to a .deb package?
[12:30] <tengo> noobie0057, how come?
[12:30] <kevin> 915resolution only works on intel chips, sorry
[12:30] <kevin> noobie0057, why?
[12:30] <sn9> GenNMX: 15 is the total bill? or just the dvr line item?
[12:30] <noobie0057> I'm having a real bug it might affect all ubuntu users
[12:30] <timo90> sudo edit soucelist
[12:31] <GenNMX> sn9: HD is $5, DVR is $10
[12:31] <kevin> noobio0057, what..?
[12:31] <mborohov> timo: totem doesnt tell me anything
[12:31] <sn9> GenNMX: oh, then it's $3 less than TiVo
=== Farm_Fresh is now known as Gun_Smoke
[12:31] <kevin> hexion can u reinstall linux and still survive?
[12:32] <mborohov> it looks like oss is the only thing working right now
[12:32] <tengo> is there any video card that works with ubuntu out of the box?
[12:32] <GenNMX> sn9: TiVo is $20/month with 1-year contract
[12:32] <kevin> tengo, probably not
[12:32] <noobie0057> Hi I just updated and I'm getting "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file."
[12:32] <Keyseir> fsck isn't solving a problem on my external HD, and I don't know why. Could someone look over this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33768/
[12:32] <Nukez> does anyone here use cedega?
[12:32] <timo90> mborohov:Dose you sound work on every other play or is it only totem thats giving you problems
[12:32] <hexion> kevin, I have ubuntu as my main system and totally configured... reinstalling ubuntu is very painfull... and the other fact is that reinstalling an entire OS for a sudden problem with audio is not an option for a serious system :(
[12:33] <oneortheother> I don't intend to.
[12:33] <DreamerHxC> Need help; when I do glxinfo | grep vendor I get "Error: unable to open display (null)"
[12:33] <sn9> GenNMX: since when? i'm still paying $13/mo, and they have a basic $8/mo level too
[12:33] <mborohov> no, totem works
[12:33] <mborohov> mplayer works
[12:33] <mborohov> gmplayer doesnt
[12:33] <mborohov> and gaim doesnt
[12:33] <kevin> hexion  do u have an expensive sound card or a preinstalled one?
[12:33] <GenNMX> sn9: The only TiVo box that does HD is $800 it appears
[12:33] <sethk> DreamerHxC, before running the command, do:      export DISPLAY=:0.0
[12:33] <hexion> kevin, an integrated one

[12:33] <DreamerHxC> hexion thank you, im gonna try

[12:34] <DreamerHxC> Im trying to install ATI driver but I cannot do it
[12:34] <timo90> mborohov:Its must be the setting ,make shure they are using the correct sound card
[12:35] <kevin> hexion go to system->preferences->Sound and tell me what card appears at the bottom of the screen
[12:35] <hexion> ALSA-Advanced
[12:35] <timo90> mborohov:Do you have more then one sound card installed >
[12:35] <sn9> GenNMX: holy crap, they've changed it all. at least i'm grandfathered in...
[12:36] <hexion> kevin, it's all ok, but when I press "test" no sound plays :(
[12:36] <kevin> hexion does sound work at all in ubuntu?
[12:36] <kevin> so sound worx?
[12:36] <hexion> kevin, it's very strange, the only thing that works is the TV sound
[12:36] <GenNMX> sn9: Yep, I heard about the change a while ago, and people praising their still using the old plans that aren't offered anymore. I don't understand it myself, the Comcast DVR isn't that bad for having Dual Tuner + HD-capability, seems like TiVo is shooting themselves in the foot
[12:36] <levander> Anyone using ctrlproxy?
[12:36] <kevin> hmmm... no clue..
[12:37] <hexion> kevin, no mplayer sound, system sounds, totem,..., any app but xdtv
[12:37] <DreamerHxC> hexion it's not working with export
[12:37] <GenNMX> sn9: Sure I'd love the ease of a TiVo, but I can't justify the price for the amount of TV I watch...I'd have to watch a LOT of pre-recorded TV per week, even more then the 10-12 hours I do now
[12:37] <Jowi> hexion, sounds like xdtv is locking the sound for itself. if you quit that app will the other apps have sound?
[12:38] <hexion> Jowi, no.. no sound at all.. only when I launch that app
[12:38] <oneortheother> Wine runs Fallout just fine, so I won't need anything more than Wine.
[12:38] <hexion> Jowi, even restarting
[12:38] <mborohov> no, i only have one sound card
[12:38] <mborohov> it seems like alsa isnt working properly
[12:38] <mborohov> but oss is
[12:38] <sn9> GenNMX: they've done a lot of shooting themselves in the foot, but their competitors have done way more. you do know that comcast hired TiVo to run their next gen of dvr's, right?
[12:38] <kevin> so other sound works when dxtv is open?
[12:38] <Jowi> hexion, do you have a /etc/asound.conf ?
[12:38] <mborohov> how cani get alsa to work properly?
[12:38] <hexion> no, I haven't
[12:38] <Jowi> hexion, or .asoundrc (or similar) in your home dir?
[12:39] <khermans_> can i report a launchpad issue?
[12:39] <hexion> Jowi, no, should I have?
[12:39] <Jowi> hexion, if you launch the dxtv, can you check what hardware sound settings it have? (i never used that app)
[12:40] <GenNMX> sn9: No, but I doubt Comcast would be as insane to go from $15/month to something like $50/month to justify TiVo's suped-up HD model expenses, so I think good things will be happening. The Motorolla IS much clumsier then a TiVo
[12:40] <alexis> hola
[12:40] <alexis> como estan
[12:40] <gouki> khermans_: Check the 'Feedback' link on the footer.
[12:40] <theplatypus> can anyone help with usb hotplugging?
[12:40] <Jowi> hexion, you shouldn't have that file but it is possible to specify sound hardware with it
[12:40] <alexis> fiking
[12:40] <alexis> ajajajja
[12:40] <alexis> chupenlo
[12:40] <timo90> mborohov:Make sure you have one player open at a time and because the other players have sound its got to be the settings on the other players ,take you time to examine the sound settings.
[12:40] <oneortheother> Hola
[12:40] <alexis> kien habla espaol
[12:40] <hexion> Jowi, I think xdtv has sound because it uses a different chanel (aux)

[12:45] <ubotu> hexion: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

[12:47] <squidly> anyone konw what packages I need to install a custom kernel?
[12:47] <Jowi> !kernel | squidly
[12:47] <ubotu> squidly: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[12:47] <Legendre> hm.. is there something unusual about thinkpad wireless, taht causes my wifi interface to appear as eth1?
[12:47] <sethk> generic_suse_use, check the config for your desktop.  it's desktop specific
[12:47] <hexion> Jowi, I installed something of a repository, but searched the var/cache/apt history and reverted all the changes... with no luck
[12:47] <sn9> squidly: why would you want to do that?
[12:47] <generic_suse_use> k
[12:47] <hexion> Jowi, also tried to dpkg-reconfigure
[12:47] <Legendre> shouldnt wifi interfaces appear as wl0 or something?
[12:47] <generic_suse_use> what do /I look for?
[12:47] <tengo> quick question, where do you find the trash folder
[12:47] <squidly> sn9: beacuse I like to have a slim kernel and the latest kernel does not work with my usb keyboard and mouse

[12:49] <Jowi> hexion, no, reinstall. do it via synaptic (easiest)
[12:50] <hexion> Jowi, ok, should I restart after that (I say to keep this conversation :)  )
[12:50] <sethk> squidly, I use the kernel from kernel.org.  To use it, all you need is the kernel source and the compiler.
[12:50] <Geoff_Rickly> hi there
[12:50] <Jowi> hexion, restart is not necessary (i believe) but logout/login should be
[12:50] <sethk> squidly, you take the config file from /boot, rename it to .config, then do  "make oldconfig"
[12:51] <timo90> tengo:its at the button why whould you whant it on the desktop :-/
[12:51] <sethk> squidly, then, make xconfig (or menuconfig or gconfig or whatever) and set things up as you wish

[12:58] <super> did
[12:58] <super> and it still gave me the same message
[12:58] <DrakeMastil> Does crossover WINE work on ubuntu?
[12:59] <Stormx2> DrakeMastil: Crossover Office? yeah.
[12:59] <DrakeMastil> or better question what are the gaming possibilities on ubuntu
[12:59] <Stormx2> !gaming
[12:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gaming - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:59] <Stormx2> Bleh
[12:59] <Jowi> hexion, does "ps -A | grep jackd" give you anything?
[12:59] <Stormx2> Okay
[12:59] <Stormx2> Basicly, some games have linux installers
[12:59] <hexion> Jowi, I have another edgy installation with sound ok.. is there any config file I could copy from it to make my sound work?
[12:59] <super> but i logged in as root though the login as root and i still gave me the message
[12:59] <Stormx2> UT, etc.
[12:59] <Stormx2> Others you can emulate
[12:59] <Stormx2> WINE, Cedega
[12:59] <super> ubuntu runs lots of game
[12:59] <Jordan_U> !games
[12:59] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[12:59] <sn9> DrakeMastil: crossover is not really for gaming
[12:59] <Jowi> hexion, no idea. it depends on your hardware config
[12:59] <CaptainMorgan> !pdf
[12:59] <ubotu> pdf is the Portable Document Format created by Adobe; viewable in GNU/Linux with xpdf/kpdf/gpdf, evince and also adobe reader (free download, but closed source)
[12:59] <hexion> Jowi, nothing
[01:00] <super> Cedega will run stuff quite well
[01:00] <Crippy-Boy> Tuxracer!!!!!! w00t!!!! </sarcasm>
[01:00] <DrakeMastil> i play Lineage 2 mainly what emulator will play that?
[01:00] <super> proberbly
[01:00] <DrakeMastil> cedega?
[01:00] <hexion> Jowi, now, jackd is not installed...
[01:00] <super> gogle the word transgaming
[01:00] <Geoff_Rickly> does anyone know a command to check for plugged in hardware e.g. pcmcia?
[01:00] <super> google*
[01:00] <Jordan_U> Crippy-Boy: I don't know what you are talking about, Tuxracer pwns :)
[01:00] <super> its like wine but for games
[01:00] <DrakeMastil> ty
[01:00] <DrakeMastil> much help
[01:01] <DrakeMastil> i'm going to be scrapping windows soon
[01:01] <super> but nexuiz is a free quake 3 as well as warsow if your into that stuff
[01:01] <uber_mort> wine actually runs many games just fine
[01:01] <Jowi> hexion, jackd (or any program) can still be running in memory even if it is removed. in a linux system you can update packages that are still running. it is a feature. I can only recommend you going through the sound troubleshooting guide unfortunatley
[01:01] <Jowi> !sound | hexion
[01:01] <ubotu> hexion: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[01:02] <hexion> Jowi, mmmm.. when I run "aplay --list-devices" it shows 2 cards configured with the same name... strange
[01:02] <super> wowsow is like one of the most popular esports games that run on linux as well as windows
[01:02] <DrakeMastil> i need more linux experience anyway... i work on windows machines all day at work so i dislike coming home to microsoft's shitty coding after the day is done
[01:02] <UbuntuUser> hey

[01:03] <super> i want synaptic to install packages that are on my desktop but i dont know how
[01:03] <Jowi> hexion, normal. probably 1 analog and 1 digital
[01:03] <hexion> Jowi, so that's not the problem :(
[01:03] <Jowi> nope
[01:03] <super> why does it always have to be on a bloody server why cant it just be on my HDD
[01:03] <Jordan_U> dRk_sHd0w: What do you need to install, most things are in the repositories.
[01:03] <Jordan_U> ?
[01:03] <sn9> dRk_sHd0w: in most cases, installing from .tar.gz is something best avoided anyway
[01:03] <super> oh
[01:03] <dRk_sHd0w> winrar archiver
[01:03] <bruenig> super, what are the names of the packages on your desktop, if they are .debs you should be able to install them with dpkg
[01:03] <super> thats what i  do
[01:04] <crimsun> hexion: please pastebin the output from ``asoundconf list && cat /etc/asound.conf ~/.asoundrc && amixer''
[01:04] <super> there .gz
[01:04] <UbuntuUser> does anyone know how to compile?

[01:04] <draz26> how all
[01:04] <draz26> I am tester
[01:04] <crimsun> hexion: sorry, that command should be:
[01:04] <super> i compiled
[01:04] <draz26> of mk portal
[01:04] <dRk_sHd0w> the program only comes in a .tar.gz :(
[01:04] <super> its horrible
[01:04] <crimsun> hexion: ``asoundconf list && cat /etc/asound.conf ~/.asoundrc* && amixer''
[01:04] <UbuntuUser> hmm
[01:04] <super> okay bassically
[01:04] <noiesmo> I am running nvidia driver 9269 on kubuntu edgy I have resolution set to 1152x864 however when I start Opengl game the resolution switches to 1024x768 is there a way to stop this and retain 1152x864 res
[01:04] <WMcL> super: havin everything on your harddisk would take rather much space
[01:04] <timo90> DrakeMastil:Soudnt be to hard
[01:04] <Jordan_U> dRk_sHd0w: What program?
[01:04] <dabaR> UbuntuUser: of course

[01:04] <UbuntuUser> game settings
[01:04] <holysmoke> I was wondering if anyone can help me, i'm trying to open a .run file fro an ati video driver package,  what is the command for opening a .run file?
[01:04] <super> hang on ill message you the commands
[01:04] <UbuntuUser> how then?
[01:04] <super> its not that hard
[01:04] <sethk> dRk_sHd0w, there is an open source rar/unrar program that is available in the repositories
[01:05] <hexion> crimsun, M5455 and noone of that files exist
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> tried gcc
[01:05] <spacebear> ive just installed kde and when i try to hit ctrl alt f1 to go into terminal mode nothing happens ? .. what do i need to start to have terminal sessions working ?
[01:05] <Jordan_U> !rar | dRk_sHd0w
[01:05] <ubotu> dRk_sHd0w: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> missing main.oy
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> main.py
[01:05] <super> oh i lost the piece of paper that i had that told me how to compile
[01:05] <crimsun> hexion: and what about ``amixer'' output?
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> !!!
[01:05] <sethk> UbuntuUser,
[01:05] <dRk_sHd0w> i have the program but dont know where to put the extracted files or how to use
[01:05] <sethk> UbuntuUser, that's a python file
[01:05] <super> :P
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> when I do "scons"
[01:05] <sethk> UbuntuUser, you need to install python, both regular and development packages
[01:05] <DrakeMastil> last question
[01:05] <Stormx2> UbuntuUser: I love !!!
[01:05] <UbuntuUser> says missing blah/main.py
[01:06] <UbuntuUser> dang
[01:06] <hexion> crimsun, too much info, how do I use pastebin?
[01:06] <DrakeMastil> would installing the 64biut edition of ubuntu affect gaming or other software?
[01:06] <UbuntuUser> theres like choke files
[01:06] <crimsun> !paste |hexion
[01:06] <ubotu> hexion: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[01:06] <super> what packages does synaptic use?
[01:06] <holysmoke> any clue how to open a .run file?
[01:06] <Stormx2> hexion: Pastebin.com <-- paste stuff
[01:06] <UbuntuUser> sh
[01:06] <Jordan_U> super: .deb
[01:06] <UbuntuUser> sh blah.run
[01:06] <sethk> UbuntuUser, as I said, the file you are missing is a python file.  you need to install python, both binary and development packages
[01:06] <DrakeMastil> would installing the 64bit edition of ubuntu affect gaming or other software?
[01:07] <Jordan_U> super: It is just a front end for apt-get
[01:07] <super> drake to be honest you can do 90% of stuff you do on xp in ubuntu
[01:07] <UbuntuUser> k thanks
[01:07] <Keyseir> I've having a problem fscking my external hd, could someone comment? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33768/
[01:07] <Geoff_Rickly> how do i get the "cardctl" tool?
[01:07] <Stormx2> DrakeMastil: If you've got a 64bit processer...
[01:07] <super> na
[01:07] <DrakeMastil> AMD 64Bit X2 4000+
[01:07] <super> should just run most stuff
[01:07] <DrakeMastil> :)
[01:07] <sethk> Keyseir, that's very bad.  looks like perhaps your partition table is out of sync with your file system.
[01:07] <super> ive had no probs the only probs i've had is wifi cards
[01:08] <sethk> Keyseir, that's just a guess, probably not the reason.
[01:08] <DrakeMastil> ok i'm outta here i gotta git rid of this horrid OS
[01:08] <super> buts its always my fault anyways
[01:08] <DrakeMastil> thanx all
[01:08] <Stormx2> DrakeMastil: 64bit has issues with some software, e.g. flash, but should run to your CPU's capacity.
[01:08] <super> back up first
[01:08] <Stormx2> DrakeMastil: Backups!!
[01:08] <DrakeMastil> i have 2 HD's
[01:08] <DrakeMastil> :P
[01:08] <Stormx2> DrakeMastil: Don't put all your eggs in one basket ;-)
[01:08] <sethk> Keyseir, but you have a serious problem there.  the only thing you can do is back up all your files NOW
[01:08] <DrakeMastil> un raided for a reason
[01:08] <sethk> Keyseir, then recreate the file system, and copy the files back in.
[01:08] <Willa> what do you guys use for usenet?
[01:08] <R31D> bbl
[01:08] <super> my itc department in my uni doesnt know what linux is
[01:08] <Keyseir> sethk, Well, that's my external HD. Nothing critical on it.
[01:09] <ripper> klibido works nice @ WildZeck
[01:09] <Gertoly> Does anybody know if you can connect 2 ide2usb cables together to just basically get around using a really long ide ribbon?
[01:09] <super> XD
[01:09] <ripper> klibido works nice @ Willa
[01:09] <Willa> klibido
[01:09] <timo90> Is there any good applications for use with blue tooth adpters
[01:09] <DrakeMastil> i'm leaving my windows install on this HD and putting in my new 250gb in for ubuntu but making it the primary
[01:09] <Keyseir> sethk, But I just bought it two weeks ago =/ Doh.
[01:09] <sethk> Keyseir, ok, then it isn't so bad
[01:09] <timo90> probably a blue-tooth headset
[01:09] <Stormx2> Keyseir: Don't use HDDs as coasters ;-)
[01:09] <sethk> Keyseir, it's not a hardware problem
[01:09] <Willa> ripper: what about a par solution?
[01:09] <super> what packages does synaptic use?
[01:09] <Willa> ripper" like quickpar.
[01:09] <hexion> crimsun, pastebin is lasting too much :(
[01:09] <sn9> Gertoly: not possible
[01:09] <yohan> i have a problem....ive written my own modeline in xorg but i get this in the log: (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1600x1200_100"; removing.
[01:09] <Keyseir> sethk, You're sure it isn't a physical problem?
[01:09] <ripper> Willa no clue what your talking about
[01:09] <crimsun> hexion: are you using paste.ubuntu-nl.org ?
[01:09] <DrakeMastil> Stormx2: thanks
[01:09] <yohan> ive followed this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=98456&highlight=nvidia+tvout
[01:09] <sethk> Keyseir, I'd say 98% sure
[01:09] <crimsun> hexion: avoid pastebin.com
[01:10] <yohan> please, can anyone help me?
[01:10] <hexion> oops
[01:10] <hexion> :)
[01:10] <arbir> ooh my eyes are dead :-(
[01:10] <sethk> Keyseir, you can never be 100% sure, but the odds are very very very low.
[01:10] <Willa> ripper: k
[01:10] <Jowi> yohan, how did youmake your modeline?
[01:10] <Gertoly> sn9: you know of something that could do something like that? Otherwise i'm looking at a 7 feet ribbon (which i know would have issues)
[01:10] <hexion> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33776/
[01:10] <yohan> Jowi: I have two "Monitor" thingies, i can post it on the net
[01:10] <arbir> how can i change the width of all the scroll bars in all the windows ?
[01:10] <yohan> Jowi: hold on
[01:10] <ripper> im trying to get beryl to work on my radeon 9250 beryl was starting, but now, x just loads beryl doesnt start
[01:10] <ripper> :(
[01:11] <sn9> Gertoly: if you need to connect a hard disk over seven feet, don't use ide
[01:11] <squidly> !sli
[01:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sli - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:11] <ripper> !beryl
[01:11] <MgA_Mark> Hi. Could someone help me with my bootable disk?
[01:11] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:11] <UbuntuUser> yes
[01:11] <Jowi> yohan, I'm no good at troubleshooting dual monitor setups.
[01:11] <Gertoly> sn9: use what then?
[01:11] <crimsun> hexion: are you using digital out (iec958) or analog speakers directly?
[01:11] <Stormx2> MgA_Mark: Whats the issue? :)
[01:11] <Keyseir> sethk, OK. I'm just concerned about physical problems because I think I may have messed up with trying to mount it and format it ext3 when I got it...
[01:11] <hexion> crimsun, analog only
[01:11] <sn9> Gertoly: what is your motherboard equipped with?
[01:12] <MgA_Mark> Thanks, Stormx2
[01:12] <sethk> Gertoly, you would have slightly better odds with one of the newer high speed EIDE cables (that is, better odds of it working if you string two together).  but the best thing to do with a 7 foot ribbon cable is to hang yourself.  :)
[01:12] <Keyseir> sethk, So, should I back up my files and reformat?
[01:12] <psirice> Can anyone help me? I have a problem mounting a hard drive. This is what it says: "mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[01:12] <psirice> error: could not execute pmount"
[01:12] <sethk> Keyseir, no, you can't damage the drive doing that.
[01:12] <Willa> ripper: quickpar repairs RAR files.
[01:12] <crimsun> hexion: please mute the digital output:  amixer set 'IEC958' off
[01:12] <crimsun> hexion: (using a Terminal)
[01:12] <Gertoly> i only have ide on the mobo, well usb2.0 (no sata)
[01:12] <arbir> can i change he width of my scroll bars ?
[01:12] <Gertoly> or scsi
[01:12] <linux_kid> MgA_Mark what is your problem..?
[01:12] <hexion> crimsun, done
[01:12] <kerrigan> Im having trouble with installing ATI drivers on ubuntu
[01:12] <yohan> Jowi: you might have a look at it please? http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/257139
[01:12] <sethk> Keyseir, yes, definitely, back up, do fsck.ext3.  you might run badblocks to check out the drive, if you are having doubts about the hardware.
[01:12] <sn9> Gertoly: then use the usb2
[01:12] <soundray> psirice: what type of filesystem is on sda1?
[01:12] <crimsun> hexion: is sound audible now?  aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav
[01:12] <yohan> This is my xorg: http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/257139 I get (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1600x1200_100"; removing.
[01:12] <ripper> Willa not sure; i dont use rar much
[01:13] <sethk> Keyseir, use the destructive mode of badblocks (after backing up, of course)
[01:13] <MgA_Mark> Here's the issue. It won't boot up. I can click start, and look at all the advertisements. It says if I shut down the computer, and reboot, it will load auto. But it still loads windows.
[01:13] <Gertoly> sorry, it's usb1.1 actually (forgot that)
[01:13] <hexion> crimsun, no luck yet :(
[01:13] <Keyseir> sethk, Destructive mode?
[01:13] <psirice> Soundray: Not sure how to check the filesystem.
[01:13] <sn9> Gertoly: no slots?
[01:13] <linux_kid> what bootable disk?
[01:13] <yohan> This is my xorg: http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/257139 I get (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1600x1200_100"; removing. in my Xorg.0.log...why is this? Can anyone please help me! Its in the monitor section but im not sure of the syntax...is there anyway i can do this any other way?
[01:13] <arbir> is getting defeated by the resolution of his laptop
[01:13] <Gertoly> where on earth to you get a high speed ribbon at in bulk where one can mount their own heads?
[01:13] <soundray> psirice: what is the mount command you are issuing?
[01:13] <crimsun> hexion: try:  amixer set 'External Amplifier' off
[01:14] <Jordan_U> MgA_Mark: Advertisements? What bootable CD is this ?
[01:14] <sn9> Gertoly: do you have available pci slots?
[01:14] <Jowi> yohan, well, you can set the "1600x1200" only - remove "_100" maybe?
[01:14] <psirice> soundray: I'm not trying to use a mount command, I'm just trying to open an external hard drive.
[01:14] <MgA_Mark> It's for the latest version of Ubunto.
[01:14] <hexion> crimsun, done.. no sound yet
[01:14] <yohan> Jowi: that would work but i want to use my _100 modeline
[01:14] <linux_kid> ubuntu doen't have any ads
[01:14] <yohan> Jowi: i want 100hz as refresh rate
[01:14] <Gertoly> sn9: yeah i got slots, to buy a usb io card right...that's last resort. Really, i was just wondering about the cheap hack i was talking about.
[01:14] <Legendre> hey, I run Ubunto on my Panaphonics laptop!
[01:15] <soundray> psirice: are you familiar with terminals and command lines?
[01:15] <Jordan_U> MgA_Mark: You clicked the install icon on the desktop?
[01:15] <arbir> is there a way to change the width of my scroll bars ?
[01:15] <Gertoly> i guess you need some sort of software to do that hack, not just hardware
[01:15] <sn9> Gertoly: get yourself as cheap a 1394 card (not usb) as you can. best you can do
[01:15] <MgA_Mark> Well, you can cick start and see all kinds of examples of Ubunto. But it won't boot on its own.
[01:15] <squidly> !g15

[01:15] <sn9> Gertoly: no, the hardware will not physically allow it
[01:15] <MgA_Mark> I didn't click install on the desktop. I want to run it from a cd rom.
[01:15] <MgA_Mark> \
[01:16] <linux_kid> MgA_Mark: there is not start icon in ubuntu.
[01:16] <UbuntuUser> ??
[01:16] <Jowi> yohan, do you get the same output for the modeline if you type this in a terminal (compare with the modeline in xorg.conf) "gtf 1600 1200 100 -x"
[01:16] <Jordan_U> MgA_Mark: OK, you need to set your bios to boot from CD.
[01:16] <hexion> crimsun, no sound :'(
[01:16] <UbuntuUser> cd rom drive
[01:16] <psirice> soundray: No, not really, I put my external hard drive on a linux OS. I didnt think it would do anything but now it wont open up on a windows OS and I have 5 years of work on there. So I dont want to have to format it, I want to get all the info on.
[01:16] <yohan> Jowi: yeah
[01:16] <psirice> off there*
[01:16] <crimsun> hexion: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 2
[01:17] <MgA_Mark> Bios from cd? it won't just do it auto.
[01:17] <hexion> GODDD!!!
[01:17] <hexion> crimsun, I love you :)
[01:17] <arbir> somebody plesae love me too
[01:17] <sn9> psirice: easy as pi
[01:17] <super> i want to cry
[01:17] <soundray> psirice: okay, here's something to try. Open a terminal window via Applications-Accessories.
[01:17] <arbir> super so do i
[01:17] <hexion> crimsun, that made the trick... what was it??
[01:17] <crimsun> hexion: I know you od.
[01:17] <linux_kid> CONGRATS hexion!!!!!!!!!!!
[01:17] <super> cause my wifi card wont install on ubuntu
[01:18] <Willa> linksys?
[01:18] <super> nope
[01:18] <soundray> psirice: in there, enter 'sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt' and see what it says.
[01:18] <super> cisco aronet 350
[01:18] <Jordan_U> MgA_Mark: No, there is no way for a program to change your BIOS settings, most computers boot CD's by default though.
[01:18] <crimsun> hexion: some app reset the register. Unfortunately that's a chipset quirk; too many different codecs use one of those four settings.
[01:18] <yohan> This is my xorg: http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/257139 I get (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1600x1200_100"; removing. in my Xorg.0.log...why is this? Can anyone please help me! Its in the monitor section but im not sure of the syntax...is there anyway i can do this any other way?
[01:18] <uyann> to use KDE with ubuntu, is it better to install the KDE window manager or the kubuntu distribution?
[01:18] <soundray> psirice: it'll ask for your user password
[01:18] <spacebear> in dmesg i find early in log -- Console colour VGA+ 80x25  <---- how do i change that
[01:18] <super> pcima card or whatever there called
[01:18] <yohan> ill be right back Jowi and guys!
[01:18] <UbuntuUser>  could be an iso problem
[01:18] <super> its for my laptop
[01:18] <sn9> super: that's unbelievable
[01:18] <hexion> crimsun, but I couldn't see any option to make the sound come back and I tested every single one :|
[01:18] <super> what?
[01:19] <linux_kid> super does a wireless card show up a a network interface?
[01:19] <psirice> soundray: it didnt ask me for a password, I'm just running it off of a live cd. It came up with this. mount: mount point /mn does not exist
[01:19] <sn9> super: no card has ever worked better than the aironet 350 under linux
[01:19] <Mowhawko> do xubuntu and kubuntu 6.10 releases have the same difficulties that ubuntu edgy seems to be having? (networking, upgrading, etc.)
[01:19] <super> nope i try to enable it but every time i leave the menu and come back it is disabled
[01:19] <super> heres the funny part
[01:19] <super> when i try to install the driver
[01:19] <super> it says i need to run as root
[01:19] <hexion> crimsun, and how did you thought about that command? you're a guru! :)
[01:20] <Jordan_U> Mowhawko: Yes.
[01:20] <super> so what i did was login as root through the user login
[01:20] <soundray> psirice: copy the command I gave you exactly, don't leave out any letters.
[01:20] <sn9> super: you don't install a driver; you just plug the thing in
[01:20] <super> AND IT STILL TOLD ME THE SAME THING
[01:20] <super> i cant figure it out
[01:20] <super> its a nightmare
[01:20] <crimsun> hexion: my LP page probably outlines why. :-)
[01:20] <linux_kid> super: try typing sudo infront of your command
[01:20] <UbuntuUser> no try su
[01:20] <super> tried it
[01:20] <super> tried both
[01:20] <linux_kid> that helps
[01:21] <super> it said:
[01:21] <super> computer says no
[01:21] <UbuntuUser> wth
[01:21] <linux_kid> super: does the card work in any other os
[01:21] <ryanakca> what I want to do: deny all incomming connections (except the ones created by localhost with a distant server), except ssh, http, https, and svn, so that remote hosts (even on the local network) wouldn't be able to access localhost's ftp, smtp, imap, etc, yet localhost would still be able to create outgoing connections.  would this be possible with iptables?
[01:21] <super> xp
[01:21] <psirice> soundray: Still did not work, it came up with this error. mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1,
[01:21] <psirice>        missing codepage or other error
[01:21] <psirice>        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
[01:21] <psirice>        dmesg | tail  or so
[01:21] <super> no probs on xp
[01:21] <super> wait heres something wierd about that card
[01:21] <Jordan_U> super: You should have drivers already, what are you trying to install?
[01:21] <MeGaByTeS> root@Central:/home/megabytes# winecfg

[01:21] <ryanakca> ubotu, please tell psirice about past
[01:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about past - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:21] <sn9> super: you set all the wireless settings before trying to enable the card, right?
[01:21] <hexion> crimsun, thank you very much for your help, you've made my day... I was thinking my only option was reinstalling my system :)
[01:21] <ryanakca> !paste
[01:21] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[01:21] <super> the 10.1 non remaster version and it worked
[01:22] <super> but
[01:22] <MeGaByTeS> how can i found what wine needs to run correctly
[01:22] <Crell> Hi folks.  I'm trying to setup a courier-imap daemon (using Ubuntu Edgy), and I'm having trouble authenticating.  When I try to test it via telnet, I get an "OK Courier-IMAP ready" message, then issue a login command (A login me@example.com mypasswd), I just get told "A NO Login failed".    maillog and syslog don't tell me anything more than there was a failed login.  Any idea what the issue could be?
[01:22] <super> the updater broke
[01:22] <khaije1> !wii
[01:22] <hexion> crimsun, thank you very much and good bye :)
[01:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wii - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:22] <khaije1> hehehe
[01:22] <malt> Hello_Kitty__: i'm using ubuntu linux as a server, and i was wondering is there any way i could cap my WAN but have unmetered lan?
[01:22] <super> so when i installed 10.1 remastered edition
[01:22] <Jowi> ryanakca, man hosts.deny and hosts.allow
[01:22] <Mowhawko> Jordan_U: so would you recommend just sticking with 6.06 releases for all of them right now?
[01:22] <super> the wifi card stopped working
[01:22] <soundray> psirice: okay, slightly different command now: 'sudo mount -t msdos /dev/sda1 /mnt'
[01:22] <Crell> I've already tested the smtp server (postfix), and it seems to be behaving correctly.  It's IMAP that's misbehaving.
[01:22] <super> so i re installed ubuntu
[01:22] <ryanakca> Jowi: I thought that would've been an ip tables thing?
[01:22] <super> and now im back to square one
[01:23] <linux_kid> super: did the card ever work in ubuntu?
[01:23] <Jordan_U> Mowhawko: I personally havn't had any problems with Edgy, I did a fresh install though.
[01:23] <super> nope
[01:23] <super> it lights up though
[01:23] <Mowhawko> Jordan_U: do you use wireless at all? that's been my biggest problem so far
[01:23] <linux_kid> super: do u have the .sys and .inf files i  windoze?
[01:23] <psirice> soundray: It sounded like it started to do something but it came up with another error. mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[01:23] <super> no
[01:23] <Jowi> ryanakca, easier with /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow. set up /etc/hosts.deny to block everything and set up hosts.allow to allow certain servers for certain ip ranges
[01:23] <super> i use plug and play
[01:23] <ashika> Anyone need anything
[01:23] <super> oh wait i got a idea
[01:24] <linux_kid> super: if it lights up, somthing is working...
[01:24] <ryanakca> Jowi: lol, kk
[01:24] <sn9> soundray: you're assuming facts not in evidence here
[01:24] <Zarephath> anyone use streamripper grabbing from shoutcast?
[01:24] <soundray> psirice: okay, the filesystem is clearly corrupted. Have you got any backups of the data on there?
[01:24] <Jordan_U> Mowhawko: Yes, I use wireless, try the liveCD and to test if your hardware will work before installing.
[01:24] <Crell> ashika: If you know anything about courier-imap, I could use assistance. :-)
[01:24] <ryanakca> Jowi: in that case, what would one need iptables for?
[01:24] <super> install the drivers on xp and take the .sys and .inf files and install ndiswrapper in ubuntu and use the files i copiedfrom xp
[01:24] <super> would that work?
[01:24] <kingsley> I'd like to entertain my twelve year old son by installing a flashy "destop" with something like beryl. Which verion or verions of ubuntu should I consider installing?
[01:24] <psirice> soundray: I'm not sure, I can look around.
[01:24] <ashika> Crell, Whats your problem.
[01:24] <Mowhawko> Jordan_U: It worked fine in 6.06, but as soon as I upgraded it started giving me problems, maybe I'll try a fresh install though
[01:24] <Jowi> ryanakca, firewalling  and routing of course :)
[01:24] <soundray> sn9: can you be specific?
[01:24] <sn9> super: you set all the wireless settings before trying to enable the card, right?
[01:25] <super> yeah
[01:25] <super> on the GUI
[01:25] <Crell> ashika: I'm trying to setup a courier-imap daemon (using Ubuntu Edgy), and I'm having trouble authenticating.  When I try to test it via telnet, I get an "OK Courier-IMAP ready" message, then issue a login command (A login me@example.com mypasswd), I just get told "A NO Login failed".    maillog and syslog don't tell me anything more than there was a failed login.  I've already confirmed that the smtp server (postfix) is working, via t
[01:25] <linux_kid> super: it should but it didnt work for me, i use Linuxant.
[01:25] <killown> how I permit my ip in squid?
[01:25] <ryanakca> Jowi: isn't what I was trying to do kindof firewalling? meh, now that I think of it, hosts.(deny/allow) is easier
[01:25] <sn9> soundray: you're assuming hda1, you're assuming ntfs, etc.
[01:25] <Crell> All the telnetting is from/to localhost, too.
[01:25] <Zarephath> did you try to bring up the interface after setting said settings? sometime the interface isn't initialized
[01:25] <Jowi> got to sleep. night all
[01:25] <Crell> Night, Jowi.
[01:25] <ryanakca> kingsley: get a good video card... kde + beryl
[01:25] <ryanakca> night jowi
[01:25] <Zarephath> Jowi,: night
[01:26] <super> do u have to pay for linuxant cause there site says you do i think
[01:26] <super> ?
[01:26] <ashika> Crell, You double checked login info correct
[01:26] <soundray> sn9: you should either follow the entire conversation closely, or keep out of it.
[01:26] <linux_kid> super: try "sudo modprobe wlan0" or whatever ur interface name is
[01:26] <ashika> Crell, ?
[01:26] <pilibeen> do you think a 7600gs would suffice for kde + beryl?
[01:26] <super> i see
[01:26] <pilibeen> im seeing one on sale for 50$ AR
[01:26] <sn9> soundray: sorry
[01:26] <ryanakca> kingsley: kubuntu edgy is what I was running
[01:26] <super> ill boot up my laptop one sec
[01:26] <linux_kid> super: yes, linuxant costs, but thats all that worked for me so eventually i will have to pay
[01:27] <ryanakca> pilibeen: no clue, ask in #ubuntu-xgl... I was using a ATI Radeon 9200SE
[01:27] <Crell> ashika: Yes.  I'm using a MySQL database for the postfix storage, and I'm looking at the login info now.  I've also tried multiple times in case of lazy fingers.  No change.
[01:27] <ashika> I notice most problems are people running edgy
[01:27] <Zarephath> linux_kid: Why would you try to load a driver for a network interface?
[01:27] <super> because it wont plug and play
[01:27] <kingsley> ryanakca: Does kubuntu edgy have anything like beryl?
[01:27] <ryanakca> ashika: because most people are running edgy (I think)?
[01:27] <Crell> ashika: Well, it's the new one, so that's what people are trying out. :-)
[01:27] <linux_kid> cause sometimes i have an interface but it dosn't work
[01:27] <ashika> Crell, Hmm. Did you try creating a new account?
[01:27] <super> i think a package didnt install
[01:27] <ashika> ryanakca, No this is not true. Most people prefer stability
[01:27] <soundray> psirice: I don't think you should go on experimenting with this drive if you have valuable data on there. It needs some sort of corruption fix. Whatever I can advise you to do remotely may help, but it may just as easily make matters worse.
[01:27] <Crell> ashika: What sort of new account?  Mail account?
[01:27] <linux_kid> super: that would do it
[01:27] <ashika> Crell, But if you read the warning it explicitly states API UNSTABLE.
[01:28] <Crell> This is an account I created in MySQL.
[01:28] <ashika> Crell, Yes
[01:28] <ryanakca> kingsley: beryl is desktop independent... it will run on gnome, kde, xfce...
[01:28] <super> but i dont know what the package is
[01:28] <linux_kid> do u still have the ubuntu .iso in windoze?
[01:28] <bobbie__4> Hello revolution!!!!
[01:28] <psirice> soundray: I'm willing to try it.
[01:28] <super> um
[01:28] <super> i beleted it
[01:28] <super> :(
[01:28] <ashika> Crell, Isn't there a Courier-IMAP email creater or does it suggest you do it manually
[01:28] <linux_kid> how sad
[01:28] <UbuntuUser> scons: *** No SConstruct file found.
[01:28] <UbuntuUser> File "/usr/lib/scons/SCons/Script/Main.py", line 1019, in _main???
[01:28] <super> but i verified it
[01:28] <Zarephath> super: Did you try "sudo ifup wlan0" or whatever the device name is?
[01:28] <kingsley> ryanakca: Are you using beryl?
[01:28] <super> it was fine
[01:28] <linux_kid> super: r u using 6.06 or 6.10?
[01:28] <super> 6.10
[01:28] <ryanakca> kingsley: I was untill a week or so ago
[01:29] <linux_kid> hm.
[01:29] <Crell> ashika: Not that I'm aware of.  On my old Debian Sarge server I just added records to MySQL manually.  The accounts should just be handled by postfix, not courier itself, shouldn't they?
[01:29] <kingsley> ryanakca: How did you obtain it?
[01:29] <ryanakca> kingsley: I don't have very good hardware, it was taking up too many resources here... I have an old system
[01:29] <ryanakca> kingsley: join #ubuntu-xgl
[01:29] <super> i got one idea left
[01:29] <linux_kid> super: shoot
[01:29] <nelsong> Hello guys, I'm having a wee bit of trouble right now configuring my laptop to run xinerama, actually I got it to run, but on the second monitor I can't seem to use more than half the screen. Anyone got an idea?
[01:29] <super> install fedora 6 and see if it will auto detect it :P
[01:29] <arbir> i dont find the /etc/inittab file with my version of ubuntu... have things changed ?
[01:30] <linux_kid> great!
[01:30] <sn9> nelsong: change the resolution of the other screen
[01:30] <concept10> arbir, yes, ubuntu edgy uses upstart
[01:30] <soundray> psirice: the program I'm talking about is called dosfsck. I'm not sure whether it is on the live CD - please check by entering 'dosfsck' by itself
[01:30] <super> heh no i made my ubuntu all preety i dont want to install fedora
[01:30] <linux_kid> super: how is fedora anyway?
[01:30] <arbir> thanks concept10 for the lead.. let me work on that
[01:30] <super> its high tech
[01:30] <linux_kid> super: ya, all the prettiness...
[01:30] <super> uses all the latest packagies
[01:31] <nelsong> sn9, it's running on the same resolution as the laptop monitor. 1024x768
[01:31] <arbir> there is no file called /etc/upstart
[01:31] <nelsong> should I try a higher one?
[01:31] <ashika> Crell, You have proper directory setup?
[01:31] <sn9> linux_kid: fedora is very awful
[01:31] <super> ill try the mod probe command
[01:31] <killown> how to allow ip in squid?
[01:31] <linux_kid> thanx
[01:31] <Zarephath> Man this is fsked up...the damned streams aren't being saved seperately by streamripper...
[01:31] <super> whys it awful?
[01:31] <ashika> Crell, As you are aware Courier does not automatically set up folders.
[01:31] <sn9> nelsong: lower it
[01:31] <markus__> Hello. My nfs system is not mounted at boot time. its mounted about 1 min after the the machine is ready. How can i fix that?
[01:31] <nelsong> okah...trying that right now.
[01:32] <super> fedora looks alright to me
[01:32] <arbir> i dont see /etc/upstart @ concept10
[01:32] <UbuntuUser> fedora is ok
[01:32] <Zarephath> markus__, : I assume you have it in fstab?
[01:32] <linux_kid> does fredora use GNOME?
[01:32] <UbuntuUser> I guess it does support more
[01:32] <super> yes
[01:32] <UbuntuUser> can
[01:32] <Crell> ashika: Yes.  I manually created and permissioned the directory where Maildirs will be stored.
[01:32] <markus__> Zarephath, Yes ofcourse
[01:32] <sn9> linux_kid: yes, but not well
[01:32] <super> oh whys that?
[01:32] <linux_kid> sound like a nice little server os
[01:32] <super> i thought it was very stable
[01:33] <Zarephath> markus__, : Did you try changing the entry order?
[01:33] <UbuntuUser> more configuration will be needed
[01:33] <linux_kid> well, thats why i said server
[01:33] <StFS> hello. can anybody tell me how to configure the locale in ubuntu? It used to be "dpkg-reconfigure locales" and you could select the locale but now that's not possible.
[01:33] <domi> help?
[01:33] <super> ubuntu is more preety though
[01:33] <Crell> As I said, I can successfully SMTP to it and the file gets written.
[01:33] <markus__> Zarephath, You mean to set the nfs partions first?
[01:33] <ashika> Crell, Do you have CRAM-MD5 enabled?
[01:33] <soundray> psirice: still here?
[01:33] <Crell> Um, not that I know of.
[01:33] <Crell> Just TLS.
[01:33] <domi> someone? need help... pv??
[01:33] <psirice> soundray: Yeah, where do I enter dosfsck?
[01:33] <linux_kid> ok, we all know ubuntu is better, back to super's wireless
[01:33] <sn9> super: fedora was never intended to be stable
[01:33] <UbuntuUser> what you mean
[01:33] <madewokherd> um is there a way I can install edgy from a livecd that isn't an edgy livecd?
[01:33] <domi> someone? need help... pv??
[01:34] <Zarephath> markus: I wouldn't do that..I would let your main partitions load then add it right after that...it could have to do with the parameters you have specified for nfs as well that causes it to pause
[01:34] <soundray> psirice: same place
[01:34] <UbuntuUser> wth?!
[01:34] <XiXaQ> Can someone tell me how to change the site banner in Joomla! ?
[01:34] <madewokherd> like over the network
[01:34] <UbuntuUser> pv?
[01:34] <domi> uhu
[01:34] <domi> prive
[01:34] <Crell> XiXaQ: #Joomla would know better than we would.
[01:34] <UbuntuUser> shoots
[01:34] <psirice> soundray: Okay, I did that, now what should I do?
[01:34] <UbuntuUser> you know about compiling?
[01:34] <soundray> psirice: if it's installed, it should have given you usage info. Did it?
[01:35] <super> oh noes i have problem
[01:35] <XiXaQ> Crell, ah! Thanks :)
[01:35] <markus__> Zarephath, When are the nfs partion mounted and which script do that? they are probly not mounted at the same time as the other device becuser the network simply ain't ready then
[01:35] <super> modprobe wlan0 or wlan1 cant find the card
[01:35] <psirice> soundray: This is what it gave me: "[-aAflrtvVwy]  [-d path -d ...]  [-u path -u ...]

[01:36] <Crell> ashika: Should I be running cram-md5?
[01:36] <psirice> Soundray: Sorry.

[01:36] <super> both not found
[01:36] <super> it makes me want to cry
[01:36] <linux_kid> me too
[01:37] <madewokherd> sn9: laptop
[01:37] <H3g3m0n> super: modprobe uses modules, eth0 is what is created when a module has been loaded
[01:37] <linux_kid> try ndiswrapper
[01:37] <domi> someone got time for a noob???
[01:37] <super> i tried
[01:37] <sn9> linux_kid: modprobing an interface is a fedora thing; we don't do that here
[01:37] <soundray> psirice: there is a web site for that kind of thing, if we should need it. For now, just enter 'sudo dosfsck -n /dev/sda1' and describe the response you get in one line, if you can.
[01:37] <ashika> Crell, Well its personal preference but in the documentation it has steps you should do if and if not running CRAM-MD5. For example if not running you would specift a --without-authcram option to the configure script or edit imapd and remove authcram from the AUTHMODULES setting.

[01:38] <super> isnt there a deb for ndiswrapper
[01:38] <madewokherd> 900 MHz processor
[01:38] <linux_kid> ya, try synaptic
[01:38] <madewokherd> but I can't let it run at 900 MHz or it overheats
[01:38] <super> i would
[01:38] <soundray> !ndiswrapper-utils | super
[01:38] <madewokherd> I had to do some crazy thing
[01:38] <ubotu> ndiswrapper-utils: Userspace utilities for ndiswrapper. In component main, is optional. Version 1.1-5 (edgy), package size 8 kB, installed size 48 kB
[01:38] <linux_kid> domi, what
[01:38] <matroblend> Can I reinstall 6.10 without losing my files?
[01:38] <sn9> madewokherd: is it too old to have built-in ethernet?
[01:38] <domi> time for a noob?
[01:38] <madewokherd> so that the frequency wouldn't go up that high
[01:38] <madewokherd> it has built-in ethernet
[01:38] <linux_kid> ndiswrapper had a gui
[01:39] <super> no it dont
[01:39] <psirice> Soundray: It gave me a date and some other numbers and then says seek to and more numbers then says invalid argument.

[01:39] <RedEyess> hi

[01:39] <TurtleBoots> guys someone PLEASE help me with my wireless set up. I'm really struggling
[01:39] <RedEyess> Wireless networking?
[01:39] <linux_kid> ya it does, search synaptic for ndiswrapper
[01:39] <madewokherd> but a gentoo livecd can't install ubuntu :p
[01:39] <RedEyess> good or sucks?
[01:39] <concept10> arbir, still there?
[01:39] <linux_kid> it is in universe
[01:39] <Daviey> hi, can somebody pastebin their edgy /etc/gdm/gdm.conf for me? Ta
[01:39] <sn9> madewokherd: does its bios setup have ethernet as a boot option?
[01:39] <ashika> Crell, Are you using IMAP or POP3 for log in.
[01:39] <soundray> psirice: does it say what the invalid argument is?
[01:39] <arbir> yes concept i am here
[01:39] <arbir> googling around for what you told me
[01:39] <super> welcome to my world turtle boots
[01:39] <arbir> with no luck whatsoever
[01:39] <madewokherd> sn9: I think so

[01:39] <madewokherd> I don't know how to use that
[01:39] <psirice> soundray: No, it just says invalid argument.
[01:39] <killown> how to allow ip in squid.conf?
[01:40] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: can you help?
[01:40] <concept10> abir ^^
[01:40] <RedEyess> Can I help?
[01:40] <arbir> what does that mean concept10 ?
[01:40] <RedEyess> sorry... what was the question?
[01:40] <concept10> arbir, http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[01:40] <arbir> aaah..... let me see that now
[01:40] <ashika> Crell, Are you using authdaemon
[01:40] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: guys someone PLEASE help me with my wireless set up. I'm really struggling
[01:40] <soundray> psirice: can you recheck that you entered '/dev/sda1' last in the command line?
[01:40] <arbir> concept10: can i ask you another thing?
[01:40] <RedEyess> oh
[01:40] <RedEyess> are you using an encryption key?
[01:40] <super> i downloaded fedora im considerin installing it just for the sake of finding out if my wificard will work
[01:41] <arbir> if i need to play my mp3 files ? will this work ==> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Multimedia_Codecs ?
[01:41] <kudzubane> super: what is the wifi card?
[01:41] <RedEyess> TurtleBoots?
[01:41] <madewokherd> sn9: I don't think I have enough ram for a livecd with a gui to work well
[01:41] <psirice> soundray: Yes, I entered /dev/sdal
[01:41] <ashika> super, Live cd. and did you try installing linux drivers
[01:41] <linux_kid> super: ubuntu can become pretty agian, go for it
[01:41] <super> cisco areonet 350
[01:41] <sn9> madewokherd: if the cd drive were broken and wouldn't read cd's at all, you'd be able to boot off the ethernet into an ubuntu installer. but if it can boot off usb flash, that will be easier
[01:41] <TurtleBoots> Redeyess: give me a wee second please
[01:41] <RedEyess> aiiight
[01:41] <soundray> psirice: not "l" as in "Lima", but the number '1' please
[01:41] <Crell> ashika: Yes, and it is running.  Same error.
[01:41] <madewokherd> sn9: does the ubuntu installer use X ?
[01:41] <sn9> madewokherd: how much ram is in there?
[01:42] <madewokherd> 250 MiB apparently
[01:42] <Daviey> hi, can somebody pastebin their edgy /etc/gdm/gdm.conf for me? Ta
[01:42] <sn9> madewokherd: the alternate installer does not use X for installation
[01:42] <Crell> Hm, wait a tick...
[01:42] <concept10> arbir, go ahead
[01:42] <matroblend> Can you edit conf files on your HD from SU via live cd?
[01:42] <arbir> did u see the question ?
[01:42] <psirice> soundray: Okay, I re-entered it, and it said the same thing, I think I just read it as an l, not a 1.
[01:42] <arbir> i think there is a huge lag
[01:42] <super> if fedora doesnt doesnt read the wifi card ill stick ubuntu back on since i havnt started putting my backed up files back on yet
[01:42] <sn9> madewokherd: 250??? i thought you were gonna say 16 or something
[01:43] <ashika> Crell, If authdaemond is running then check your authentication modules configuration. For example with authpam you have to configure PAM to use imap. And same auth
[01:43] <linux_kid> is fedora live?
[01:43] <UbuntuUser> no
[01:43] <madewokherd> if it were 16 I don't think I'd be using ubuntu
[01:43] <concept10> arbir, that should work
[01:43] <super> not the one i downloaded
[01:43] <ashika> Crell, Some auth's use a authldap and authmysql check those.
[01:43] <Crell> ashika: Hang on, I think I may have found an issue.
[01:43] <linux_kid> that sux
[01:43] <arbir> k let me try it now!
[01:43] <sn9> madewokherd: if it has 250, you have enough for even the heaviest X apps
[01:43] <Crell> Apparently courier-authlib-mysql wasn't installed, when I thought it was.
[01:43] <concept10> arbir, there is no lag, im just doing a couple of things at one time so you have to use my name
[01:43] <Crell> Installing that now.
[01:44] <RedEyess> wifi with an encryption key doesn't always work for using Ubuntu
[01:44] <ashika> Crell, Lastly double check database and make sure your using maildirs $HOME/maildir and you are not using mailboxes as it does not support mailboc.
[01:44] <ashika> Crell, Oh.
[01:44] <super> is there a console command for enabling the wifi card?
[01:44] <RedEyess> ( or other Linux distros for that matter )
[01:44] <madewokherd> oh they run
[01:44] <soundray> psirice: that's pretty bad news. There might be other tools you could try to rescue your filesystem, but I don't know of any.
[01:44] <arbir> yes i realised that i need to use your name @ concept10
[01:44] <ashika> Crell, Lol I was under impression you have all libraries
[01:44] <RedEyess> I should just buy a centrino laptop
[01:44] <antonio_> iwconfig power on
[01:44] <linux_kid> super: if u use bcm43xx or ndiswrapper there is a command
[01:44] <Crell> ashika: I was under that impression, too. :-)
[01:44] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: why does encryption not always work witj Ubuntu?
[01:44] <psirice> soundray: What do you mean? What's the bad news about it?
[01:44] <ashika> Crell, Make sure authmysql is configured right.
[01:44] <RedEyess> not sure
[01:44] <madewokherd> but as I understand it in a livecd environment ram is a lot more important for things to work properly
[01:44] <sn9> madewokherd: is it a p3 or a celeron?
[01:44] <concept10> arbir, just use tab complete, type half the name and then hit tab
[01:44] <TurtleBoots> thats what I'm trying to setup
[01:44] <Crell> ashika: Looking into that as we speak.
[01:45] <madewokherd> err...
[01:45] <TurtleBoots> I had it working before but now I just can't get it to work
[01:45] <madewokherd> mobile AMD Athlon(tm) 4 Processor
[01:45] <zidoen> hmm, i'm running VLC Mediaplayer on Ubuntu Edgy, but "Fullscreen" isn't really fullscreen.. using Gnome, anybody know how to actually make it FULLscreen?
[01:45] <ashika> Crell, and I dont know if authldap applies to your situation.
[01:45] <killown> I get access denied to squid when I put local ip firefox proxy configuration what I do  to fix it??
[01:45] <arbir> oh yeah , i know abotu the tab , thanks though @ concept10
[01:45] <RedEyess> TurtleBoots: Have you tried ****-****-** with your encryption key
[01:45] <nelsong> sn9, the resolution part did not work but I seem to have found an answer on the forums. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=295096 just in case anyone else asks.
[01:45] <linux_kid> super: give me in output of iwconfig...
[01:45] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: I don
[01:45] <soundray> psirice: well, normally dosfsck -n would look at a corrupted filesystem and tell you what's wrong with it. This means that there isn't even enough of a filesystem there that dosfsck would recognize it.
[01:45] <Crell> ashika: I've no LDAP, so I suspect not.
[01:45] <arbir> i am getting this error " Package w32codecs is not available, but is referred to by another package." @ concept10
[01:45] <Crell> Although I've got the cycles, so I may consider LDAP at some point in the future, just to say that I have it. :-)
[01:45] <RedEyess> I don?
[01:46] <RedEyess> what does that mean?
[01:46] <TurtleBoots> don't quite understand what yuo mean by  ****-***-***
[01:46] <ashika> Crell, then you should be ready to roll :) let me know how it works out.
[01:46] <TurtleBoots> typo sorrie dude
[01:46] <sn9> madewokherd: i thought you wanted to install, rather than run live...
[01:46] <Crell> Will do.
[01:46] <madewokherd> I do
[01:46] <psirice> soundray: Wow, that's not good at all. Well, thank you for all of your help sir.
[01:46] <ashika> Crell, out of curiosity why are you running a server off of EE build and not server versions?
[01:46] <madewokherd> if there's an installer that isn't very heavy I think I'll be ok
[01:46] <Crell> I'm running the EE-server amd64 version.
[01:46] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: sorry that was a typo earlier
[01:46] <ashika> Crell, Ah
[01:46] <Belboz99> hey all, I'm compiling a new kernel, should I use the Intel EM64T as my processor type?  I have an Intel Core 2 Duo
[01:46] <sn9> madewokherd: the network based installer does not use X
[01:47] <ashika> Crell, You use a single core for a server?
[01:47] <soundray> psirice: I'm sorry there wasn't much I could do.
[01:47] <kudzubane> Belboz99: that should be ok
[01:47] <Crell> It's a single-core single-proc AMD64, yes.
[01:47] <TurtleBoots> Redeyess: I dont quite understans what you mean by ****-***-**
[01:47] <tengo> can someone help me with my resolution problem?
[01:47] <soundray> psirice: it might be worth checking the web for filesystem rescue tools.
[01:47] <ashika> Crell, personal use?
[01:47] <Belboz99> thanks kudzubane
[01:47] <UbuntuUser> fuck scons goddamnit

[01:48] <Revolution> I'm having some trouble with Ubuntu
[01:48] <Crell> ashika: Yeah, home server.  My PII/400 with the BIOS that can't modern hard drives and a hard drive that is louder than my air conditioner is dying, so I figured it was time to upgrade.
[01:48] <arbir> is browsing the link that concept10 just provided
[01:48] <linux_kid> super: have we solved our problem?
[01:48] <RedEyess> after each 4 digits/letters there should be a dash
[01:48] <super> i have to set up my card its not plug and play says a random bloke in a ubuntu forum
[01:48] <ihatetripe> Hi everyone. I am wanting to intall Digikam 0.9 on my Ubuntu install. This version is new, and not included in any repositories I can find. Am I best off creating a deb file from source, or from an RPM? Thanks in Advance
[01:48] <super> however
[01:48] <Revolution> Can someone help me with getting my ubuntu boot disk to work?
[01:48] <ashika> Crell, Ah so you run the amd 24/7. Out of curiosity what is it's power consumption
[01:48] <super> i know nothing about linux so i dont know what to do
[01:48] <soundray> psirice: there is another possibility, which is that the filesystem isn't of the msdos type, even though mount seems to have recognized it as such.
[01:49] <tengo> Whenever I change the resolution out of 800x600, the logon screen will loop over and over again. I have an AMD chipset, so 915resolution didn't work. I'm running Ubuntu Edgy Eft.
[01:49] <TurtleBoots> RedEyess: I just enter my key under system->admin->networking and it doesn't give the option of a specific format
[01:49] <Crell> ashika: When I have an idea, I'll let you know.  It's less than a week old. :-)
[01:49] <super> i presume theres some sort of wifi card setup console thingy
[01:49] <Crell> But it's very quiet.
[01:49] <sn9> Crell: you can put a modern hard disk in a 486; linux won't care what the bios thinks
[01:49] <Revolution> Can anyone help me with a problem on Ubuntu?
[01:49] <linux_kid> nope
[01:49] <tengo> revolution what is it
[01:49] <UbuntuUser> ..
[01:49] <khermans_> Revolution, ?
[01:49] <UbuntuUser> just ask the question
[01:49] <Revolution> so i have a live cd

[01:49] <linux_kid> and...
[01:49] <tengo> yes you do revolution

[01:49] <DreamerHxC> Can someone help me with my problem please? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1802847#post1802847
[01:49] <ashika> Crell, So you just run it 24/7 without problems?
[01:50] <Revolution> but im having trouble getting it to boot on my older comp
[01:50] <Daviey> Hi, XDMCP only works when connecting to localhost.  Any ideas why?
[01:50] <Crell> sn9: Yes, but the BIOS is needed to get TO Linux.  Old server has an insanely loud 15 GB drive for / and a 120 GB drive that the BIOS doesn't know about for /home.
[01:50] <Crell> New server has a single SATA 320 GB drive.
[01:50] <RedEyess> TurtleBoots: http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/46385/
[01:50] <RedEyess> that's one article
[01:50] <RedEyess> let me find another before you try anything
[01:50] <tengo> revolution did you check the bios settings to see if you boot cd drives before harddrives/external drives?
[01:50] <Crell> ashika: Well, so far.  Again, it's not even a week old yet.
[01:50] <Revolution> It wont boot on my older PII and im not sure why
[01:50] <TurtleBoots> thanks RedEyess
[01:50] <Crell> But my living room typically has 4 24/7 boxen.
[01:50] <Revolution> yea i set it to CD
[01:50] <madewokherd> sn9: so how do I start this network-based installer?
[01:50] <sn9> Crell: the bios doesn't need to know about /home, just /boot
[01:50] <ashika> Crell, I mean even with your old server
[01:50] <Revolution> but then it says no bootable devices
[01:50] <Crell> sn9: ... I know.
[01:51] <RedEyess> TurtleBoots: read this one too: http://ccsd.msoe.edu/faq/linux/Ubuntu.jsp?IDFaq=223
[01:51] <Crell> That's my point.
[01:51] <nelsong> Great, it works.
[01:51] <sn9> Crell: ok...
[01:51] <ashika> Crell, I mean I have only left my PC on for a full 24 hours a few times
[01:51] <khermans_> Revolution, maybe the cdrom drive is bad
[01:51] <Revolution> no
[01:51] <Revolution> it works on my other comps
[01:51] <Crell> ashika: Oh, most of my systems have been 2/47 for several years.
[01:51] <khermans_> Revolution, yeah i said the drive
[01:51] <Revolution> but on my older one i need it to work on it wont
[01:51] <tengo> revolution, no the cd drive is bad, not teh cd
[01:51] <Revolution> no that works too
[01:51] <sn9> madewokherd: well, you can set up an ethernet boot, but it would be much easier if your machine can boot from usb flash
[01:51] <TurtleBoots> I'll try that RedEyess... thanks
[01:51] <khermans_> Revolution, is it a cd writer?
[01:52] <Revolution> no
[01:52] <madewokherd> I don't know if it can
[01:52] <khermans_> Revolution, if it is an old CD-ROM, might have trouble reading CD-R/CD-RW
[01:52] <ashika> Crell, 2/47 isnt that hard xD lol j/k
[01:52] <Revolution> like i said it's an old machine so maybe that aids to theproblem
[01:52] <linux_kid> Revolution: does the cdrom drive work in windows
[01:52] <super> hmmm
[01:52] <Luisakamotor> hello people
[01:52] <madewokherd> but the only usb flash drive I have has data on it that's important to me
[01:52] <madewokherd> so I'd rather not mess with it
[01:52] <Luisakamotor> anybody can help me?
[01:52] <Revolution> well when i select the boot it says cd-r/cd/cd-rw
[01:52] <khermans_> Revolution, then try a floppy boot
[01:52] <super> i think theres a way to fix my problem with /ect/interfaces/ folder
[01:52] <ashika> Revolution, What are you trying to do
[01:52] <Revolution> the computer has no floppy drive

[01:53] <khermans_> Revolution, PXE boot?
[01:53] <Revolution> im trying to boot ubuntu from a cd
[01:53] <Crell> ashika: 2/47 would be impossible for any computer. :-)
[01:53] <Revolution> now idea what PXE is

[01:55] <Revolution> hmm it doestn have a floppy drive...maybe a flash?
[01:55] <khermans_> Revolution, highly unlikely it boots from flash
[01:56] <Revolution> yea old comp
[01:56] <khermans_> Revolution, try net boot
[01:56] <lazarus> hmm
[01:56] <khermans_> Revolution, but it takes some hacking configs
[01:56] <soundray> matroblend: would it not be better to try and fix the boot problem?
[01:56] <Revolution> way over my head
[01:56] <Revolution> im new to all of this
[01:56] <matroblend> Soundray Yes if I knew what I was  doing
[01:56] <Revolution> i just wanted ubuntu because its fast and works on slow machines and is really cool
[01:56] <lazarus> halpo: what jdk are you running...  i'm still running dapper, so I won't be of much help if the problem is specific to the new version
[01:56] <sn9> Revolution: sure, if it can boot from flash. i was about to walk madewokherd through the same thing
[01:57] <khermans_> Revolution, xubuntu is better for slow machines
[01:57] <lazarus> well, specific to edgy anyways
[01:57] <soundray> matroblend: you may be lucky and get some guidance in here.
[01:57] <Halpo> lazarus: jdk?
[01:57] <soundray> matroblend: what happens when you try to boot from the hard disk?

[01:57] <nayru> Hello, how do you login as root on ubuntu? Kind of a dumb question but it wont let me do it on the login screen
[01:57] <UbuntuUser> HELLZ YES!
[01:57] <khermans_> nayru, sudo -i
[01:57] <tonyyarusso> TurtleBoots: What do you mean?
[01:57] <Revolution> the hard disk works
[01:57] <UbuntuUser> YAFRAY WORKS!
[01:57] <madewokherd> speaking of floppies
[01:57] <tonyyarusso> !root | nayru
[01:57] <ubotu> nayru: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:57] <soundray> TurtleBoots: /etc/shadow
[01:57] <Crell> nayru: You don't.  PRefix a command with sudo
[01:57] <lazarus> so you need some java runtime environment
[01:57] <Revolution> on the hard disk i have XP
[01:57] <madewokherd> could I use one of those instead of flash? :p
[01:57] <Revolution> can i set ubuntu.iso on the hard disk?
[01:57] <kudzubane> nayru: ubuntu subscribes to the sudo philosophy
[01:58] <linux_kid> nayru, what version r u running, dapper or edgy
[01:58] <UbuntuUser> Do you like bananas?
[01:58] <TurtleBoots> I mean the file that you can enter the wireless encrypt key into
[01:58] <Halpo> lazarus: oh yeah, well it works for C stuff to I believe, I havent used it much, but i just know i liked the setup of it before i upgraded
[01:58] <khermans_> nayru, you should not!
[01:58] <Daviey> Hi, XDMCP only works when connecting to localhost.  Any ideas why?
[01:58] <antonio_> join #xubuntu
[01:58] <TurtleBoots> do you know what I mean?
[01:58] <Halpo> its not a huge deal but was just curious
[01:58] <khermans_> Daviey, xhost +
[01:58] <nayru> let me try some stuff brb
[01:58] <lazarus> sure, but the IDE itself is written in java, so you need a runtime environment to run it
[01:58] <tonyyarusso> !wifi | TurtleBoots
[01:58] <ubotu> TurtleBoots: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[01:58] <Daviey> khermans_, ?
[01:58] <Revolution> Would it be possivle to set my ubuntu.iso to my hard drive and then reboot and have it boot from it?
[01:58] <soundray> TurtleBoots: I think that's /etc/network/interfaces if it's WEP
[01:58] <khermans_> Daviey, you cant connect from outside?
[01:58] <peterp> hey , anyone have working compiz + edgy  with the edgy packages?
[01:58] <Daviey> correct
[01:58] <matroblend> I tried to follow ati vid drivers for fglrx and when I got to the reboot part it would not load drivers
[01:58] <sn9> madewokherd: a floppy-based install of ubuntu will be the worst of both worlds -- you would need to set up a network boot AND a bootable disk
[01:59] <khermans_> Revolution, yes kinda
[01:59] <arbir> u there concept10 ?
[01:59] <lazarus> Halpo:  what do you see when you execute "which java"
[01:59] <Revolution> how would i do that?
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[01:59] <madewokherd> umm....
[01:59] <Daviey> i can only get a connection to localhost, not from another machine on my lan
[01:59] <khermans_> Revolution, it is a very involved process
[01:59] <concept10> arbir, yeah
[01:59] <CPrgmSwR2> I am having a problem getting my computer to boot from the livecd - its as if the cd-rom is not reconized as a bootable cd-rom can seomeone help me?
[01:59] <soundray> matroblend: what exactly happens when you try to boot from the hard disk?
[01:59] <khermans_> Daviey, make sure you allow remote connections
[01:59] <TurtleBoots> thanks guys
[01:59] <Halpo> i get a directory.../usr/bin/java
[01:59] <madewokherd> what's the problem with the network boot anyway?
[01:59] <arbir> would you know how to increase the width of the scroll bars of all my windows ? @ concept10
[01:59] <lazarus> Halpo: nevermind....execute java --version instead
[01:59] <Daviey> khermans_, is enabled
[01:59] <HeathenDan> CPrgmSwR2, check your bios. set it to boot from the cd before the hdd
[01:59] <MikeW> I'm trying to open gedit as root so I can edit my xorg.conf file but typing sudo gedit doesn't actually do anything
[01:59] <madewokherd> that you don't want me to do it?
[01:59] <MikeW> Any ideas?
[02:00] <Revolution> i have no idea on how to do the net boot...
[02:00] <matroblend> I would have to leave and try reboot
[02:00] <Halpo> 1.4.2
[02:00] <sn9> Revolution: actually, booting an installer iso from the hd is quite easy, if it's an option
[02:00] <linux_kid> CPrgmSR2: set ur bios to boot from cd before hdd
[02:00] <Revolution> sn9: how so?
[02:00] <concept10> arbir, get another theme? :)
[02:00] <Revolution> it is an option
[02:00] <CPrgmSwR2> HeathenDan the windows XP cd works just fine
[02:00] <Halpo> i tried installing 1.5.0 the other day because firefox needed a plugin, but i was never successful
[02:00] <arbir> like what ?
[02:00] <khermans_> Revolution, http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-229.html
[02:00] <arbir> i am running the Human theme now concept10
[02:00] <Halpo> i've only ever installed from synaptic package manager
[02:01] <CPrgmSwR2> but for some reason the ubuntu won't
[02:01] <soundray> matroblend: before you do that: Do you have a rough idea at what point the booting fails?
[02:01] <sn9> madewokherd: you would need to set up a second machine for it to connect to, and set it up just right. that's why usb-boot is much easier
[02:01] <lazarus> Halpo, if the jdk specific to edgy has changed from dapper, the problem could be related to the new jdk included in the distro
[02:01] <concept10> arbir, im not sure I understand what you are attempting to do
[02:01] <HeathenDan> i see. maybe the cd is borked. check the iso image's md5 sum. also, make sure you verified your cd after burning it
[02:01] <CPrgmSwR2> okay thnx
[02:01] <sn9> Revolution: on the ubuntu mirrors are prepackaged booters for installing that way
[02:01] <madewokherd> ...
[02:01] <arbir> concept10: i run a resolution of 1920 x 1200 and my scroll bars in all applications are frightfully thin
[02:01] <HeathenDan> and make sure you burned it as an image file, if you burned the iso as a data file, it will not boot
[02:02] <madewokherd> I think I'll just try the alternate cd
[02:02] <khermans_> Revolution, does it have windows on it already?
[02:02] <arbir> concept10: i would like to increase the width of those scroll bars
[02:02] <nayru> How come i cant look at any directories or anything when im using sudo -i (im a totall linux noob)
[02:02] <Daviey> khermans_, Also, if i try to connect using my localhosts IP address (ie 10.0.0.x) then i get the same result.  On works using 'localhost'
[02:02] <sn9> madewokherd: if you already have that burned, that's even easier
[02:02] <khermans_> Daviey, so seems like port blocking issue
[02:02] <khermans_> Daviey, iptables or config is setting it to block
[02:02] <linux_kid> arbir: tryn using a different theme from art.gnome.org
[02:02] <matroblend> Soundray: I was following a guide to upgrade vid drivers on a ati 9550 radon and when it came to the reboot part it failed
[02:02] <eternale1> anyone know hwat happened to unrar? why is it unrar-free now? it doesn't seem to work the correctly anymore
[02:02] <concept10> arbir, this is a screenshot of my desktop: http://pastie.caboo.se/paste/asset/21490/Screenshot-2.png
[02:02] <madewokherd> I don't have it burned
[02:02] <Daviey> khermans_, i checked with firestarter
[02:02] <concept10> arbir, you want something like that?
[02:03] <madewokherd> I have the gui one burned :p
[02:03] <lazarus> Halpo, you could try to install the J2SE runtime environment from java.sun.com
[02:03] <khermans_> Daviey, type xhost +
[02:03] <arbir> concept10: arbir is checking
[02:03] <Daviey> khermans_, plus i tried it on another machine (clean instalL)
[02:03] <Dreamglider> hello
[02:03] <crimsun> !info unrar-nonfree
[02:03] <ubotu> Package unrar-nonfree does not exist in any distro I know
[02:03] <Daviey> khermans_, what does that do?
[02:03] <CPrgmSwR2> HeathenDan the weirdness in this situation is that my friend can boot from the cd-rom just fine that is ubuntu
[02:03] <arbir> linux_kid: i tried other themes nothing suits me for now
[02:03] <lazarus> Halpo, there is a version for linux, and the installation is really easy
[02:03] <crimsun> !info unrar
[02:03] <soundray> matroblend: can you remember how/when it failed?
[02:03] <ubotu> unrar: Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version). In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:3.5.4-0.1 (edgy), package size 84 kB, installed size 216 kB
[02:03] <CPrgmSwR2> I can't seem too
[02:03] <khermans_> Daviey, allows any addrss to connect
[02:03] <khermans_> to X
[02:03] <Halpo> ill try that again i guess
[02:03] <crimsun> eternale1: lsb_release -r
[02:03] <sn9> madewokherd: the gui one i almost never recommend for an installation, but there's absolutely no reason you can't use it
[02:03] <CPrgmSwR2> Do I still need to recheck the md5 check sum
[02:03] <madewokherd> yes there is
[02:04] <matroblend> Soundray:no I will do another reboot and write it down
[02:04] <madewokherd> I tried it and it didn't start
[02:04] <arbir> concept10: even your scroll bars are think :-)
[02:04] <Daviey> khermans_, brb
[02:04] <super> screw it im installing fedora
[02:04] <lazarus> Halpo, basically after you install this version of java, then just modify your path to run the new one
[02:04] <linux_kid> i dont no if u can change the width of anything unless u search in gnomes and window x's files for a while
[02:04] <arbir> yeah sure i like your theme which, desktop are you using ? @ concept10
[02:04] <HeathenDan> CPrgmSwR2, it won't hurt to check, yes
[02:04] <madewokherd> I think my cd drive may be prone to overheating
[02:04] <lazarus> i.e. "which java" shouldn't be in /usr/bin anymore
[02:04] <Halpo> ok
[02:04] <concept10> arbir, they are normal size
[02:04] <soundray> matroblend: while you're at it, see if you can boot in recovery mode (second grub boot option)
[02:04] <sn9> madewokherd: then that's a video driver problem, not a ram one
[02:04] <Dreamglider> why is avi playback in fullscreen full off horisontall lines, im using VLC
[02:04] <matroblend> soundray:ok
[02:05] <madewokherd> maybe
[02:05] <eternale1> 6.10
[02:05] <madewokherd> but I tried it again
[02:05] <concept10> arbir, using gnome with a murina theme
[02:05] <arbir> concept10: i sure would like to give it a go, the theme you got
[02:05] <madewokherd> and once more
[02:05] <Halpo> what kind of a process is an Popup error message window....i have one that wont go away and dont know what its called to kill it
[02:05] <crimsun> eternale1: do you have 'unrar' installed?
[02:05] <arbir> murina, is it ? concept10
[02:05] <eternale1> it won't let me
[02:05] <arbir> let me check it out
[02:05] <madewokherd> and it didn't even get as far in the boot process :p
[02:05] <sn9> madewokherd: yup; video driver problem
[02:05] <eternale1> so no.
[02:05] <crimsun> eternale1: it should if you have multiverse enabled
[02:05] <madewokherd> last time the boot menu didn't even show up
[02:06] <sn9> really?
[02:06] <Daviey> khermans_, naa, still didn't work
[02:06] <madewokherd> but it did the first time
[02:06] <soundray> Halpo: for that kind of situation you have xkill
[02:06] <khermans_> Daviey, what is the error?
[02:06] <eternale1> which i do.
[02:06] <eternale1> strange
[02:06] <khermans_> Daviey, run a trace with wireshark
[02:06] <madewokherd> though video driver problems wouldn't surprise me
[02:06] <sn9> madewokherd: ok, if the boot menu showed up once, but not again, heat is the most likely suspect
[02:06] <tupa> hi: im installing an ubuntu-based distro, but when it is installing i get this error
[02:06] <crimsun> eternale1: probably not if you can't install. Pastebin the spew from ``apt-cache policy unrar && sudo apt-get install unrar''
[02:06] <wasp_ems> hello.i am using xubuntu..i installed both beryl and xgl..when i enter xgl it is really laggy..if i run beryl-manager the whole systems freezes..if i run beryl-xgl beryl runs fine but no window manager runs with it..any ideas?
[02:07] <concept10> arbir, yep, it gnome, I like this look too: http://pastie.caboo.se/paste/asset/1994/Screenshot.png
[02:07] <Daviey> khermans_, i will do that, but i think it's a job for tommorow
[02:07] <tupa> (numbers) buffer i/o error on device hda logical block "numbers"
[02:07] <madewokherd> in that case
[02:07] <tupa> anyone can help me?
[02:07] <madewokherd> would the alternate cd even be likely to help?
[02:07] <linux_kid> tupa: what distro
[02:07] <khermans_> tupa, yup seen it
[02:07] <Halpo> soundray: how do i figure out what the error window is IDed?
[02:07] <tupa> its name is manolix, not very known
[02:08] <tupa> but has what i need
[02:08] <khermans_> tupa, see it on older non-cdr drives
[02:08] <sn9> madewokherd: the machine definitely needs help of the hardware kind. i have performed such laptop surgery successfully before, but it's off-topic here
[02:08] <khermans_> tupa, even with ubuntu
[02:08] <arbir> concept10: i guess, if this does not suit me, i might have to switch to KDE
[02:08] <soundray> Halpo: you won't have to. If you run xkill, your mouse cursor should turn into a crosshair or a skull. With that, you click on the misbehaving window.
[02:08] <madewokherd> but it works
[02:08] <sn9> madewokherd: and i mean that exact problem
[02:08] <madewokherd> as long as it doesn't work too hard
[02:08] <Halpo> got it, thanks
[02:08] <tupa> khermans: ???, my cd-r is new
[02:08] <arbir> concept10: i was trying my best not to look at kde.. but my scroll bars are really thin...... :-(
[02:09] <Dreamglider> why is avi playback in full-screen full off horizontal lines, I'm using VLC
[02:09] <khermans_> tupa, what machine is this?
[02:09] <Crell> w00t!
[02:09] <soundray> Oh shoot, I think he xkilled his IRC client...
[02:09] <khermans_> DreamerHxC, bad encoding?
[02:09] <Crell> Drat, he left.
[02:09] <tupa> 686, pentium 4 - 3.00 Ghz, ht
[02:09] <concept10> arbir, its probably just your resolution
[02:09] <Dreamglider> khermans_: it is only in fullscreen, windowed is fine!
[02:10] <arbir> concept10: like i said, its my resolution.. if i get it below 1920 x 1200 then it sucks like hell.... all things get squished
[02:10] <khermans_> DreamerHxC, widescreen?
[02:10] <sn9> madewokherd: laptops should not be concerned about overwork
[02:10] <Dreamglider> khermans_:  No
[02:10] <madewokherd> I suppose
[02:11] <khermans_> Dreamglider, this on edgy?
[02:11] <madewokherd> but I don't expect much from this one :p
[02:11] <eternale1> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/257177
[02:11] <Dreamglider> khermans_:  6.06
[02:11] <khermans_> dunno
[02:11] <crimsun> eternale1: right, you don't have multiverse enabled.
[02:11] <khermans_> i use edgy -- no issues
[02:11] <eternale1> wanna see my sources?
[02:11] <crimsun> eternale1: user
[02:11] <eternale1> on pastbine..
[02:11] <crimsun> sure^
[02:12] <sn9> madewokherd: that's what i heard from every laptop owner that has ever told me about this exact problem
[02:12] <madewokherd> are you sure there's no way I could do this from a random non-ubuntu livecd environment?
[02:12] <tupa> khermans: p4 - 3.00 ghz
[02:12] <sn9> madewokherd: that won't help if it's having "heat lock-ups"
[02:12] <eternale1> crimsun: pastebin.ca/257179
[02:13] <madewokherd> it will if I can get another livecd to work
[02:13] <madewokherd> and I know I can
[02:13] <cica> wireless config in ubuntu is a total gypsie!
[02:13] <madewokherd> I could start trying to install gentoo on here
[02:13] <crimsun> eternale1: note how you have edgy-backports enabled for multiverse but not edgy itself.
[02:13] <madewokherd> which would work beautifully I'm sure :p
[02:14] <cica> !gypsie
[02:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gypsie - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:14] <eternale1> so add those two multiverse lines to "edgy" instead of "edgy-backports"
[02:14] <sn9> madewokherd: if it's not consistent about the point at which it fails, but always fails, expect it to fail no matter what it does
[02:14] <MikeW> How do I edit my xorg.conf file in edgy? when I type sudo gedit .... gedit never seems to load
[02:15] <khermans_> MikeW, nano -w xorg.conf
[02:15] <madewokherd> ...
[02:15] <khermans_> sudo it
[02:15] <madewokherd> I don't have random lock-ups here
[02:15] <madewokherd> I have lock-ups when the cpu runs at 900 MHz for too long
[02:15] <khermans_> made, laptop?
[02:15] <Megaqwerty> my sound isn't working. Any Ideas?
[02:16] <madewokherd> and apparently another separate problem with the cd drive
[02:16] <madewokherd> that is limited to preventing the cd drive from reading properly
[02:16] <khermans_> madewokherd, you can manually set the Mhz
[02:16] <n> YO
[02:16] <sn9> madewokherd: if you were local, i might offer to get the thing running normally for you, but you're not...
[02:16] <MikeW> khermans_: I typed sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf and pressed enter at the password prompt, and nothing happened
[02:16] <madewokherd> I'm almost certainly not
[02:16] <Tarvok> How do I make wine fullscreen when it's already running?
[02:16] <Megaqwerty> (Sorry that I don't have any other diagnostic data that that) ^^
[02:16] <madewokherd> and how would you get it running normally?
[02:16] <soundray> khermans_: excellent, how? I want mine at 7500
[02:16] <mborohov> hey question
[02:17] <khermans_> MikeW, it should bring up an editor
[02:17] <MikeW> oh, it seems I needed to enter my OWN password
[02:17] <n> you need to type "winecfg" in console
[02:17] <mborohov> why is it that i cant resize some windows when using beryl?
[02:17] <n> without quotes
[02:17] <khermans_> MikeW, whos password would you enter with sudo?
[02:17] <madewokherd> I see I am definitely not
[02:17] <MikeW> khermans_: dunno, nothing I've read said I had to enter my own as no username was mentioned
[02:17] <sn9> madewokherd: first thing i would do is ascertain the exact nature and extent of the failures to run a regular installer
[02:18] <Megaqwerty> mborohov: you need to enable the resize plugin
[02:18] <mborohov> where do i do that?
[02:18] <Megaqwerty> (in beryl-settings)
[02:18] <eternale1> crimsun: thanks :)
[02:18] <madewokherd> um, I think the installers have mostly worked before today
[02:18] <crimsun> eternale1: yw
[02:18] <khermans_> MikeW, sudo means superuser-do , like you do it as su without knowing root credentials
[02:18] <madewokherd> I'm running ubuntu dapper right now
[02:18] <madewokherd> so I must have installed some form of it at some point
[02:18] <Crell> Does anyone have a favorite jabber server to use on ubuntu?  I've been using ejabberd in the past, but I am open to new ideas for this server.  I'm mostly looking for easy maintenance and good feature set (group chats, logging, encyption).
[02:18] <Megaqwerty> mborohov: click on the beryl tray icon, and choose Beryl Settings Manager
[02:18] <linux_kid> sudo requires ur password
[02:19] <FunnyLookinHat> Crell, just hijack chat.google.com     ; )
[02:19] <khermans_> Crell, google!
[02:19] <MikeW> and now to try and get it to recognise that my monitor can do more than 60hz...
[02:19] <sn9> madewokherd: then it's possible the heat problem is taking a cumulative toll. you have dapper on it right now? then why did you want to run an installer?
[02:19] <Crell> Nah, I want to run my own so that I have my own domain. :-)
[02:19] <madewokherd> the current setup has some problems I'd rather reinstall than deal with
[02:19] <Crell> MikeW: You wouldn't happen to be Mike Waldron, would you?
[02:19] <Megaqwerty> Can anyone help me figure out why my sound doesn't work?
[02:20] <FunnyLookinHat> Crell, www.google.com/a/   = Google hosting for your own domain to get your own domain and all for gtoogle chat, gmail, etc.
[02:20] <MikeW> Crell: I wouldn't
[02:20] <Crell> MikeW: Never midn then.
[02:20] <Crell> FunnyLookinHat: Yeah... I'm still running my own box.
[02:20] <khermans_> Crell, try ejabberd
[02:20] <FunnyLookinHat> Crell, I ditched my own hosting box a while ago...   ; )
[02:20] <sn9> madewokherd: do you remember how you installed dapper? because if you were gonna reinstall, i'd probably recommend it to be dapper anyway
[02:20] <Crell> khermans_: Yeah, that's what I've been using.  I was wondering if anything had changed in the market in the past 2 years.
[02:21] <mumrah> i'm installing Edgy 64bit on a machine with SATA drives, and the installation is taking forever
[02:21] <madewokherd> I assume I used the cd :p
[02:21] <mumrah> it's also failed a couple of times
[02:21] <Megaqwerty> !sound
[02:21] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[02:21] <madewokherd> since I don't know how to do anything else
[02:22] <Jager-> UGGHH!
[02:22] <Jager-> defragging ntfs is hell
[02:22] <sn9> madewokherd: if you still have THAT cd, try it, and see what happens
[02:22] <morten_> i'm trying to vnc to my ubuntu box. i keep getting a 111 (connection refused) error. ps aux reports that X is started with the -nolisten tcp option. would this be why?
[02:23] <Megaqwerty> Jager-: what do you mean?
[02:23] <madewokherd> sn9: what if it starts?
[02:23] <Jager-> It takes a very very long time
[02:23] <morten_> i'm trying to vnc to :1, btw, not :0
[02:23] <Megaqwerty> jager-: oh, yeah.
[02:23] <soundray> Jager-: are you surprised? NTFS is from the people who brought you Edlin ;)
[02:23] <khermans_> morten_, vnc is a different protocol
[02:23] <sn9> madewokherd: then go ahead and install if you want
[02:23] <Mark45> Hello, I am trying to install ubuntu on my laptop to do a dual boot.  However, I am not able to add all of the partitions I need using System Rescue CD
[02:23] <morten_> khermans_: okay. where do you recommend i start looking, then?
[02:23] <Mark45> When i go to "create" it is greyed out
[02:23] <Jager-> I started it and left it defragging at 3%.. went to see a movie and went to dinner and now its at 26%... lol
[02:24] <khermans_> morten_, System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
[02:24] <MikeW> ah, that's better. Damned had to edit a text file so I could see my screen at above 60hz. sheesh
[02:24] <morten_> just yesterday, i was able to connect to :0 using x11vnc. but using vnc4server going to :1, i'm unable
[02:24] <soundray> Jager-: sensible filesystems don't need defragmenting
[02:24] <Jager-> And I gotta wait for it to finish defragging before I can install ubuntu :'(
[02:24] <Mark45> Does anyone know if System Rescue CD is able to create 5 partitions?
[02:24] <morten_> khermans_: what on earth does that have to do with anything?
[02:24] <sn9> Jager-: that's not always true. sometimes, chkdsk/f is all you need
[02:25] <morten_> the box i'm vnc'ing to doesn't even have gnome installed (and it's sure as hell staying that way)
[02:25] <Jager-> Already tried it :(
[02:25] <mumrah> can anyone help me with my installation?
[02:25] <khermans_> morten_, you want to access your computer remotely right?
[02:25] <sn9> Jager-: with the /f ?
[02:25] <Jager-> yes
[02:25] <morten_> yes i do. using vncviewer and vncserver.
[02:25] <Megaqwerty> !ubotu
[02:25] <fildo> x11vnc better
[02:25] <sn9> Jager-: did you reboot into windows twice afterward?
[02:25] <morten_> fildo: x11vnc is for accessing :0. that's not what i'm doing.
[02:25] <Jager-> yup
[02:25] <fildo> but thats my opinion
[02:26] <khermans_> morten_, well i assumed you're a dumb gnome user
[02:26] <morten_> i'm not <3
[02:26] <fildo> ah ok
[02:26] <Mark45> can I pm anyone who has used Rescue CD to reparition their HD to dualboot ubuntu?
[02:26] <Megaqwerty> where do I go to praise those who made and maintain "ubotu"?
[02:26] <morten_> #ubotu
[02:26] <voidmage> This is strange..
[02:26] <khermans_> morten_, well obviously you are getting a TCP RST packet
[02:26] <voidmage> sometimes /proc/cpuinfo reports the wrong cpu speed
[02:26] <morten_> well, yes. it's not timing out.
[02:26] <Megaqwerty> thanks
[02:26] <morten_> i'm getting a connection refused immediately
[02:27] <sn9> Mark45: if it's a new install of ubuntu, you can do that and install with one cd
[02:27] <DigitalNinja> What's a good application for capturing video from a webcam
[02:27] <morten_> Megaqwerty: that's an actual channel?
[02:27] <khermans_> morten_, so go check why the port is not open
[02:27] <Megaqwerty> no
[02:27] <morten_> k
[02:27] <soundray> Megaqwerty: come back here often and help other people on the ubuntu train ;)
[02:27] <khermans_> morten_, is port 5900 open?
[02:27] <khermans_> or 5901?
[02:27] <morten_> should be. that box isn't running iptables.
[02:27] <khermans_> morten_, nc server.foo.com 5900
[02:28] <soundray> voidmage: how do you know it's wrong?
[02:28] <Megaqwerty> soundray: and I already do whenever I can. But it's my dad's birthday, so...goodnight all!
[02:28] <voidmage> Because my cpu is 2000mhz and it's reporting 1000mhz
[02:28] <morten_> hm. refused.
[02:28] <timo90> Dose any one have bemused ? installed
[02:28] <khermans_> morten_, so port 5900 is closed
[02:28] <timo90> mines wont work
=== FloK is now known as uffiole
[02:28] <khermans_> morten_, 5900 == xorg display 0
[02:29] <khermans_> morten_, 5901 == display 1
[02:29] <khermans_> etc
[02:29] <morten_> khermans_: yea, i know. all ports seem closed. even 80.
[02:29] <soundray> voidmage: you're probably running powernowd, so that's the expected behaviour. It goes up when you run a CPU-intensive process.
[02:29] <morten_> i'm mounting samba shares on this computer, tho. what port is samba, again?
[02:29] <Tarvok> Can someone help me with winecfg crashing when I click the "sound" tab?
[02:29] <morten_> er, from this computer
[02:29] <Jager-> gonna go try to install ubutu again... wish me luck!
[02:29] <agent> using gettext in python, how does one write strings that include variables? ex: "aaa"+variable+"bbb"
[02:30] <khermans_> morten_, 135
[02:30] <voidmage> soundray: I wasn't aware that I was running that, or what it does even.
[02:30] <khermans_> morten_, or 139/445
[02:30] <khermans_> i forget
[02:30] <morten_> khermans_: refused, refused
[02:30] <morten_> something's weird here
[02:30] <khermans_> morten_, yeah ill say
[02:30] <khermans_> morten_, sudo aptitude install nmap && nmap server.foo.com
[02:31] <soundray> voidmage: it's a daemon that adapts your CPU frequency to the current requirements, thereby saving power, reducing system temperature and extending the life of your hardware.
[02:31] <voidmage> soundray: hmm.. it's not running though
[02:32] <mumrah> last call: i'm having trouble with my installation, amd64 version of 6.10
[02:32] <Anarquista> buntu-es
[02:32] <Anarquista> sorry :P
[02:32] <khermans_> mumrah, give me $10, ill fix it!
[02:32] <khermans_> mumrah, hehe -- last call
[02:33] <morten_> khermans_: got five ports open, here
[02:33] <khermans_> i have amd64 laptop
[02:33] <khermans_> morphish, well which ones?
[02:33] <Tarvok> Can someone help me with winecfg crashing when I click the "sound" tab?
[02:33] <tainted_> hello!
[02:33] <soundray> voidmage: it's doing its work though. Run "sudo /etc/init.d/powernowd stop" and check your CPU frequency again.
[02:33] <morten_> khermans_: 22, 139, 445, 6543, 6544
[02:33] <voidmage> ah, i see
[02:33] <khermans_> morten_, ssh, samba, ?
[02:33] <voidmage> that was it then
[02:34] <tainted_> i would like to put together a box where if i insert a usb drive, it automagically imports all the mp3s and includes them in a master playlist
[02:34] <morten_> 445 is reported as microsoft-ds. not sure what's up with that. 6543 and 6544 are used by mythtv.
[02:34] <tainted_> basically an automated jukebox
[02:34] <khermans_> morten_, its the naming service
[02:34] <khermans_> morten_, well i see why vnc doesnt work
[02:34] <morten_> ah, yes. yes, i presume that is evident. the box is locked up tyte.
[02:34] <voidmage> started compiling something and my cpu went up again
[02:34] <khermans_> morten_, what are you trying to do?
[02:34] <voidmage> interesting
[02:35] <morten_> but iptables -L returns nothing
[02:35] <khermans_> morten_, you want to run a GUI program remotely?
[02:35] <khermans_> morten_, or do you need the whole desktop?
[02:35] <soundray> voidmage: you have a Athlon 64 3200 with a Venice core?
[02:35] <morten_> khermans_: one program.
[02:35] <voidmage> soundray: yep
[02:35] <khermans_> morten_, what program?
[02:35] <morten_> amarok
[02:35] <soundray> voidmage: now how did I know that? ;)
[02:35] <morten_> i could use ssh tunnelling, but i'd like to be able to disconnect from it without it closing
[02:36] <morten_> can ssh do that?
[02:36] <voidmage> soundray: how did you know that?
[02:36] <khermans_> ssh -Y user@server "amarok"
[02:36] <soundray> voidmage: I have the same. It's fairly typical of AMD to have a minimum scaling frequency of half the maximum.
[02:36] <morten_> khermans_: will amarok close when i close the session, or will it keep running on remote, so i can bring it back up?
[02:37] <voidmage> soundray: i'd never seen that before
[02:37] <khermans_> morten_, so you want the program to run remotely?
[02:37] <morten_> yes, sort of. i want to be able to bring it up locally, but keep running remotely when i close it locally
[02:37] <morten_> is that even possible?
[02:37] <khermans_> morten_, screen
[02:38] <morten_> amarok is a gui app. can screen pull it off?
[02:38] <Jager> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33785/
[02:38] <Jager> should I say yes?
[02:38] <Jager> will that still do /f?
[02:38] <rogue780> !php

[02:38] <tupa> excuse me: how can i compare a cd-rom against an iso file??
[02:38] <tupa> using md5
[02:39] <morten_> khermans_?
[02:39] <Jager> i just did chkdsk /f
[02:39] <Jager> and i got a message sagin it cannot lock the drive
[02:39] <Jager> and i can schedule it for the next start up..
[02:39] <soundray> tupa: 'md5sum file.iso ; md5sum /dev/cdrom'
[02:39] <Jager> should i do it at startup? will it still fix files?
[02:40] <khermans_> morten_, so you want to control it sometimes
[02:40] <khermans_> morten_, leave it running
[02:40] <morten_> well, yes. but i'm controlling it from a laptop
[02:40] <khermans_> morten_, i wonder if you can put it in the bacground
[02:40] <morten_> and this is for controlling my media centre, so it's sorta 'mission critical'
[02:40] <morten_> khermans_: when i put it in the background it's in the background on my laptop
[02:40] <DreamerHxC> what happens if "ls /etc/inittab" shows "no such file or diredctory"?
[02:41] <khermans_> morten_, i mean remotely
[02:41] <sn9> Jager: reboot into windows, and it will run. reboot into windows twice afterwards
[02:41] <morten_> khermans_: that is what i want to do, yes. i was merely reporting what it does now.
[02:41] <Jager> okay
[02:41] <soundray> DreamerHxC: init will run with all default settings. No idea what they are...
[02:42] <corevette> whats a good partition editor?
[02:42] <morten_> khermans_: however, if i put it in the background on the remote computer, how would i bring it back up?
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> ahm
[02:42] <FunnyLookinHat> corevette, gparted?
[02:42] <soundray> corevette: parted, qtparted, gparted, fdisk, cfdisk
[02:42] <DreamerHxC> so what does it means?
[02:42] <khermans_> morten_, foreground
[02:42] <morten_> use parted or fdisk. the other ones are kinda gay.
[02:42] <pv2b> i'm on a ppc mac. has anyone installed and booted ubuntu on an ipod used as an external hard drive? anything special i need to consider?
[02:42] <khermans_> morten_, cfdisk is good
[02:43] <morten_> khermans_: i suppose i spoke too soon. cfdisk is the only one of those i haven't tried.
[02:43] <DARKGuy> Greetings, does anybody knows how to force a refresh rate on a monitor by configuring X? I'm running a dual monitor display and the right monitor (Multilite brand... black and white, damn old) can use 1024x768 @ 43Hz interlaced according to Windoze, but in the Screen Resolution panel, there's no 43Hz option shown. Any help?
[02:44] <Crell> hm.  If I'm migrating from one mail server to another, is it safe to simply copy the Maildir archive from the old box to the new box and run a chown -R if necessary?
[02:44] <morten_> khermans_: what did you mean by foreground, btw?
[02:44] <morten_> is that a tool to bring programs to the foreground?
[02:44] <khermans_> morten_, kill -STOP `pidof amarok`
[02:44] <khermans_> morten_, kill -CONT `pidof amarok`
[02:44] <morten_> that would stop playback though, wouldn't it?
[02:44] <khermans_> morten_, than is pause and continue
[02:44] <khermans_> yea
[02:44] <morten_> wouldn't want that :(
[02:44] <mborohov> weird
[02:45] <mborohov> sound just all of a sudden started working
[02:45] <mborohov> thats really weird
[02:46] <soundray> mborohov: probbly a wobbly ;)
[02:46] <mborohov> a wobblt?
[02:46] <Crell> Is that a Russian hobbit?
[02:46] <soundray> mborohov: an intermittently failing electrical connection
[02:46] <morten_> khermans_: it's not that bad. my laptop is always running, anyways. doesn't really matter if the media player depends on it.
[02:46] <mborohov> s/wobblt/wobbly/g
[02:46] <mborohov> oh, heh
[02:47] <mborohov> dude, i love the amazingness of the true transparency in beryl
[02:47] <mborohov> man.
[02:47] <morten_> khermans_: thanks for your help
[02:47] <khermans_> morten_, are you sure remot eocmputer has VNC running?
[02:47] <morten_> amusingly, i ended up going back to my initial solution
[02:47] <morten_> khermans_: yes
[02:47] <morten_> i'm sure
[02:47] <mborohov> whats a quick way to get my framerate?
[02:47] <khermans_> morten_, then i would SSH tunnel the VNC connection
[02:47] <DARKGuy> Hm, nobody knows how to force 1024x768 @ 43Hz interlaced for a secondary monitor then? :(
[02:48] <morten_> khermans_: that would work...
[02:48] <morten_> that's a good idea in either case...
[02:48] <soundray> DARKGuy: there are options for hsync and vertical refresh that you can set in xorg.conf
[02:49] <soundray> DARKGuy: but it's possible that you have to create a modeline from scratch
[02:49] <DARKGuy> soundray, yup, I've read about that, but I don't have the manual of this monitor and it's so old that there's no info found in google :(
[02:49] <corevette> how do i get ubuntu to recognize my other hard drive?
[02:49] <pv2b> DARKGuy: are you sure you really want to have a monitor running at 1024x768 interlaced?
[02:49] <^TMX> I've got edgy installed, but it seems that it's given me the plain kernel, rather than the SMP kernel (proc/cpuinfo only has information on cpu0).  How can I get the SMP kernel?
[02:50] <DARKGuy> soundray, Hm oO a modeline can force the resolution?
[02:50] <pv2b> at 43 Hz at that
[02:50] <DARKGuy> pv2b, Well, it's the highest it can run... at 60Hz it shows scrolling video gibberish o.o;
[02:50] <welch> i'm trying to install ubuntu on an old 500mhz computer. i could not boot from my old dapper disk; the load was slow and evenually just stopped. i tried an eft disk and now the boot has stopped with an orange screen. the mouse is responsive. but, i have no idea what is wrong.....
[02:50] <DARKGuy> same with 800x600... _ it has its own problems inside xD;
[02:50] <Sir_Jerkface> anyone have any experience with compilation errors in mmpython, for freevo installation?
[02:50] <soundray> DARKGuy: yes
[02:51] <maxxism> good evening all
[02:51] <khermans_> morten_, on your local machine
[02:51] <pv2b> DARKGuy: but yeah, you should be able to tweak yourself a modeline to do that. i've never done itmyself. try googling around gfor x11 modeline orsomething
[02:51] <pv2b> might find something useful.
[02:51] <Sir_Jerkface> or could anyone tell me which part of this (http://pastebin.com/832234) is most significant or how i could solve the problem?
[02:51] <tupa> how do i know if my cd-rw support burnfree, and what is it good for?
[02:52] <DARKGuy> soundray, cool! how would I do that, then? o.o; - pv2b, I shall try in a bit, as soundray seems to know something about modelines too ^^;
[02:52] <soundray> DARKGuy: not sure if it's useful for you, but try videogen
=== ^TMX is now known as TMX
[02:52] <welch> do i not have enough ram? is the cd drive too slow or broken?
[02:52] <corevette> how do i get ubuntu to recognize my second hard drive?
[02:52] <soundray> !videogen | DARKGuy
[02:52] <ubotu> videogen: Create arbitrary-res modelines using hardware parameters. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.32-2 (edgy), package size 25 kB, installed size 128 kB
[02:52] <DARKGuy> Now that's a cool bot :P
[02:52] <welch> corvette: sudo fdisk -l
[02:52] <timo90> hey how do i log out from beeing root
[02:52] <soundray> corevette: is there data already on there?
[02:52] <khermans_> morten_, ssh -N -L 9999:localhost:5900 user@server
[02:52] <welch> does it show up there?
[02:52] <corevette> soundray, no
[02:52] <tupa> timo90 logout?
[02:52] <timo90> i know you suod -i  to be root
[02:53] <soundray> corevette: have you created any partitions on it?
[02:53] <khermans_> morten_, vnc localhost:9999
[02:53] <timo90> tupa: yes
[02:53] <corevette> soundray no
[02:53] <timo90> exit wont work
[02:53] <LaserLine> corevette: does BIOS recognize it?
[02:53] <Sir_Jerkface> can anyone take a look at this and let me know what they think? (http://pastebin.com/832234)
[02:53] <soundray> LaserLine: that's irrelevant
[02:54] <soundray> corevette: enter 'sudo fdisk -l' in a terminal and see if you can tell from the numbers which of the output stanzas refers to your second hard drive.
[02:54] <corevette> laserline, soundray, i got it, i forgot to parition it
[02:54] <khermans_> morten_, did you get that?
[02:54] <tupa> excuse me: how do i know if my dvd-rw device supports burnfree, and what is it for?
[02:54] <welch> i know my question is likely silly, but anyone give me a hand? why would the boot process freeze and what can i do to fix the problem?
[02:54] <timo90> Got it lol
[02:54] <corevette> soundray, if i do sudo fdisk -l i see the drive, but how do i get to it?
[02:55] <timo90> You just type logout
[02:56] <soundray> corevette: you know the name now, so assuming it is /dev/hdb, you can run 'sudo fdisk /dev/hdb' and create a partition
[02:56] <timo90>  How do i locate a file in the terminal
[02:56] <timo90> ?
[02:56] <soundray> corevette: and when you have a partition you can create a filesystem: 'sudo mke2fs -j /dev/hdb1'
[02:56] <tupa> timo90: locate "file"??
[02:56] <soundray> timo90: 'sudo updatedb ; locate name-of-the-file'
[02:57] <timo90> Thanks all
[02:57] <morten_> khermans_: damn it. i can't get this working either.
[02:57] <soundray> corevette: and when the filesystem is there, you can mount it with 'sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt'
[02:59] <welch> i'm trying to install ubuntu on an old 500mhz computer. i could not boot from my old dapper disk; the load was slow and evenually just stopped. i tried an eft disk and now the boot has stopped with an orange screen. the mouse is responsive. but, i have no idea what is wrong..... i have tried several times and found the same result each time. google has not helped
[03:00] <soundray> welch: how much RAM does it have?
[03:01] <c_lisp> anybody know how I can ntfs-3g for my usb thumbdrives?
[03:01] <c_lisp> so I can write to them to?
[03:01] <c_lisp> I don't see them in fstab
[03:01] <kitche> c_lisp: usb drives are usually vfat or fat32
[03:02] <coz_> c_lisp, what format are the thumbdrives?
[03:02] <c_lisp> ntfs
[03:02] <DARKGuy> soundray: Alright, I got the app and I'm reading the man page now, it says that I'll need to supply the maximum dot product, and max h&v rate in Hz. Since I have no specs for the monitor... I tried using http://www.bohne-lang.de/spec/linux/modeline/ by some previous googling and I wonder if I should use the values shown when I type 43Hz or 87Hz? I tried that 43Hz modeline it generates and it doesn't look safe :(
[03:02] <coz_> c_lisp, well.. why do have them formatted in ntfs?
[03:02] <GenNMX> I've found a good number of flash drives to be FAT12...or maybe that was digital media cards like SD, MMC, etc.
[03:02] <c_lisp> how it came
[03:02] <chalcedony> Vim: Caught deadly signal SEGV
[03:02] <chalcedony> Vim: Double signal, exiting
[03:02] <chalcedony> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[03:03] <Sir_Jerkface> has anyone taken a look at my pastebin? (http://img.4chan.org/b/src/1164417161233.jpg)
[03:03] <Sir_Jerkface> whoops
[03:03] <coz_> c_lisp, mmm what manufacturer of the drives
[03:03] <Sir_Jerkface> that's a picture of a cat
[03:03] <DARKGuy> Lol
[03:03] <soundray> DARKGuy: graphics cards are fairly robust these days. So the worst thing that can happen is that your monitor explodes.
[03:03] <soundray> :)
[03:03] <chalcedony> soundray: how totally reassuring!
[03:03] <Sir_Jerkface> this is the real link (http://pastebin.com/832234)
[03:03] <DARKGuy> soundray, Oh, that's nice to know (considering the secondary monitor has a Trident 9685 4Mb card) xD
[03:03] <timo90> can i get some help in installing this bemused softwear
[03:03] <redDEADresolve> how do i keep my windows partition (sda1) from mounting when i log into ubuntu. I want to be able to access it but don't need it to show up when i load in
[03:04] <timo90> i cab do a paste bin if it helps
[03:04] <c_lisp> sorry
[03:04] <coz_> c_lisp, I am not sure what to tell you, fat is the best formatting so that it can be shared between windows and linux, however, I believe there is a way to access them if not wirte to them, but I don't know what that is.. all my thimbdrives are in fat

[03:05] <soundray> redDEADresolve: in /etc/fstab, add "noauto, users" to the options for the partition.
[03:05] <c_lisp> brute force what valehru
[03:05] <soundray> redDEADresolve: oops, I think you have to leave out the space after the comma.
[03:05] <Kingsqueak> I like 'sudo vipw' myself
[03:06] <redDEADresolve> ok im gonna try it
[03:06] <Rasta> sup
[03:06] <coz_> c_lisp, oh well if possible, just format them in fat that way you can share betwen windows and linux if that is your gola, if however, you are only on linux then definately format them in fat
[03:06] <valehru> clisp, a rar file
[03:06] <coz_> gole
[03:06] <coz_> not gola

[03:07] <soundray> coz_: I disagree -- the best filesystem for sharing between Linux and Windows is ext3 (there is a good ext2 driver for Windows that will work) (c_lisp)
[03:07] <c_lisp> fat not good for hug hardrives
[03:07] <c_lisp> I thought
[03:07] <HeathenDan> win may not read linux-created fat partitions
[03:07] <pv2b> c_lisp: a thumbdrive is not a huge harddrive.
[03:07] <GenNMX> Alter-Ego: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[03:07] <c_lisp> yea I have that soundray to read linux drives :)
[03:07] <coz_> soundray, well then you can explain that to c_lisp
[03:07] <valehru> DjViper, i don't care, I've got a cluster, and I wouldnt mind checking it out to see how fast it gets it done...
[03:07] <c_lisp> bad thing you don't always have admin privs so if you try to share on a friend pc

[03:12] <soundray> corevette: if you only create one partition, make it a primary.
[03:12] <woro2006> the website contains no links to files
[03:13] <GenNMX> woro2006: As I said, DownThemAll addon for Firefox will do the trick.

[03:17] <tonyyarusso> FFForever: Sure - it's FLOSS code.  The base is called supybot - there's an Ubuntu package for it.

[03:18] <super> does anyone else have problems with there wifi?
[03:18] <voidmage> good news! i get 5fps in ut2004!
[03:18] <bruenig> taladon, do sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop, then run those commands to remove ubuntu and kubuntu
[03:18] <clearzen> Could someone help me use cvs to download a package from a repository??
[03:18] <voidmage> any suggestions to make it faster?
[03:19] <corevette> how do you access a mounted hard drive?
[03:19] <super> anyone here using a laptop with a wifi card?
[03:19] <bruenig> corvette, go to where the mountpoint is and browse away
[03:19] <JoshJ> so, i have a problem: My parents want to be able to listen to music on Amazon.com ( http://tinyurl.com/ync7gd ) in Dapper.  It works for me in Edgy (the WMP version). What do I need to do in order to get this to work in Dapper?
[03:19] <maxxism> super:  i have been trying to

[03:19] <JoshJ> !wifi
[03:19] <snype> super-- yes
[03:19] <soundray> corevette: if you've followed my instructions to the letter, it's under /mnt -- go to it via Places-Computer-Filesystem
[03:19] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:19] <GenNMX> woro2006: The server forces you to go to index.html if it exists, so unless you have access besides HTTP protocol then not possible.

[03:20] <voidmage> Anyone know how to make ut2004 get more than 5fps? (x800, using radeon drivers, trying to avoid fglrx if possible)
[03:20] <soundray> corevette: enter 'mount' to check whether and where it's mounted. Look for the line that contains the device name.
[03:21] <soundray> corevette: probably the last line
[03:21] <JoshJ> bruenig: thanks, let me try that

[03:22] <Royito> hello
[03:22] <clearzen> do I need to set CVSROOT to download a package using CVS??
[03:22] <soundray> corevette: try a 'ls /mnt' -- it should say 'lost+found'
[03:23] <bruenig> !hi | Royito
[03:23] <ubotu> Royito: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:23] <corevette> soundray yeah it does....but how do i put stuff on the drive?
[03:23] <Royito> i can put my clock in 12 hours and i dont know why
[03:23] <pv2b> i'm on a ppc mac. has anyone installed and booted ubuntu on an ipod used as an external hard drive? anything special i need to consider?
[03:23] <bruenig> Royito, right click on the clock, select properties, then you should be able to select 12 hour
[03:24] <bruenig> Royito, it might say AM/PM, that is the same
[03:24] <soundray> corevette: create a directory for everyone to read and write: 'sudo mkdir /mnt/music ; chmod 777 /mnt/music', then you can move stuff into it
[03:24] <Sir_Jerkface> clearzen: i don't believe so
[03:24] <soundray> corevette: 'music' is an example (hope that's obvious)
[03:25] <Royito> hello bruening
[03:26] <bruenig> !es
[03:26] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[03:26] <Royito> but im not able to change to am/pm or 12 hours because in the options it doent appears
[03:26] <FFForever> will beryl work well on my 700mhz amd mobile in my Compaq Presario V2000?
[03:26] <Royito> hoo hello obutu
[03:26] <bruenig> FFForever, I am going to say no, you can check #ubuntu-xgl
[03:26] <soundray> FFForever: it depends on the graphics card more than the CPU. But I'd say it's unlikely
[03:27] <FFForever> its an ATI XPRESS
[03:27] <bruenig> well yeah if the graphics card has beastly memory, then it would probably be ok
[03:27] <Royito> im not able to change to 12 hours in preferences not appears
[03:27] <JoshJ> bruenig , thanks, my parents are on linux because windows broke ;[
[03:27] <bruenig> JoshJ, me too

[03:27] <JoshJ> -_-

[03:28] <Royito> show date
[03:28] <Royito> and use UTC
[03:28] <bruenig> show AM/PM should be there. I am on xubuntu. I forgot what the ubuntu clock dialog looked like
[03:29] <Royito> 24 hours, UNIX hours Internet hour
[03:29] <bruenig> what does internet hour do
[03:29] <JoshJ> internet time perhaps?
[03:29] <FFForever> whats the diffrence from begal and locate?
[03:29] <Rasta> someone knows if theres an ubuntu app that works like the windows active desktop?
[03:29] <kitche> it probably syncs to a server bruenig
[03:29] <Royito> internet hours it  @145
[03:29] <bruenig> kitche, yes I assumed :), I meant the format
[03:29] <JoshJ> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_time
[03:29] <JoshJ> very odd format

[03:31] <jadams> I use the Gnome 'Full Screen' mode all the time (have it mapped to ctrl-shift-f), and there are some apps (gvim, for instance) that I'd /always/ like to start fullscreen.  Is there a way to set this in gconf perhaps?
[03:31] <bruenig> Is it, I thought it refreshed
[03:32] <NigelS> 01/01/1970, the beginning of the unix epoch, you'll be saying next that you never had billion second party
[03:32] <Royito> how could i change it  :'-(

[03:41] <ryanakca> maurox: I've been threw the whole iptables thing...
[03:41] <super> onrpg.com all free games
[03:42] <snype> onrpg.com nice
[03:42] <super> what about a antivirus?
[03:42] <snype> not really man
[03:42] <super> sweet
[03:42] <ryanakca> maurox: unless you have an easy way to fix it... :D
[03:42] <tonyyarusso> !virus | super
[03:42] <super> and any adware?
[03:42] <ubotu> super: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[03:42] <Leo2> nice been here to know more about my ubuntu
[03:42] <snype> sweet
[03:42] <tonyyarusso> !firewall | super
[03:42] <snype> i like ubuntu
[03:42] <ubotu> super: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[03:42] <FFForever> what are some good games for linux?
[03:42] <timo90> soundray:what file do i edit ,im trying to install an bemused application
[03:43] <Roy> yeah it change le languaje and the time too
[03:43] <soundray> FFForever: planetpenguin-racer ;)
[03:43] <tonyyarusso> !games | FFForever
[03:43] <ubotu> FFForever: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[03:43] <super> shall i just leave the firewall as it is?
[03:43] <Leo2> How to see my startup programe like chkconfig list ?
[03:43] <sn9> super: you don't really need a firewall, but if you want one, you can install Firestarter using the Synaptic Package Manager, or just Add/Remove Programs
[03:43] <tonyyarusso> super: most likely, unless you have a reason to do otherwise
[03:43] <ryanakca> how do I block all services from the outside except ssh, http and https? I've been messing around with iptables all day with no success... Firestarter and Guarddog are not what I'm looking for. Any suggestions?
[03:43] <tonyyarusso> sn9: He already has one - it's in the kernel by default.  Firestarter is just a graphical frontend for editing the firewall configuration
[03:43] <FFForever> !ffforever | ffforever
[03:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ffforever - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:44] <soundray> timo90: see if 'ls -l /bin/sh' says that it points to /bin/dash. If it does, enter 'cd /bin ; sudo ln -sf bash sh'. Then try again
[03:44] <Roy> now i have 12 hours at the clock but.... all its in english hahaha just that im in venezuela and i speak more espanish that english
[03:44] <sn9> tonyyarusso: yeah, but it's off by default
[03:44] <super> not really i just want to do my homework, look at tities, type random crap to my girlfriend and play quake an awful lot
[03:44] <tonyyarusso> sn9: No...
[03:44] <ryanakca> sn9: not off, just doesn't have any rules in it
[03:44] <Leo2> can anyone tell me how to do on ubuntu like 'chkconfig list '?
[03:44] <wasp_ems> hello anyone know how to change sessions and start up options?
[03:44] <sn9> ryanakca: same thing
[03:44] <timo90> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2006-11-08 16:12 /bin/sh -> dash
[03:45] <ryanakca> tonyyarusso: right?
[03:45] <tonyyarusso> ryanakca: It should be no open ports by default
[03:45] <sn9> i always refer to "sudo iptables -F" as "turning off the firewall"
[03:45] <ryanakca> yeah
[03:45] <Leo2> what = 'chkconfig list ' on ubuntu?
[03:45] <sn9> Leo2: man update-rc.d
[03:46] <Roy> hey?
[03:46] <timo90> soundray:it now says /bin/sh
[03:46] <Leo2> sn9 : But i can not find list option
[03:46] <plesnivyjano> does anyone know why there is no smbpasswd file in /etc/samba ???
[03:46] <Roy> that will mean that the 12 hours it just are  for english languaje?
[03:46] <Leo2> update-rc.d how to list?
[03:46] <soundray> plesnivyjano: you're expected to create one (shock, horror!)
[03:47] <Leo2> not only add and remove
[03:47] <fourat> anyone can suggest me a site referencing good 3d games ?
[03:47] <Roy> what you think soudray?
[03:47] <soundray> Leo2: use bum
[03:47] <soundray> !bum | Leo2
[03:47] <ubotu> Leo2: Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto

[03:49] <sn9> Roy: if you chose English during installation, and want a different language, System -> Administration -> Language Support
[03:49] <soundray> timo90: okay, it wasn't dash's fault. Something is wrong with the script code.
[03:50] <dsl9477> anyone plz  a command to make a screenshot

[03:50] <Roy> yeah soundray but that its not the idea of been changin the languaje at any moment mmm  >:-(
[03:51] <soundray> timo90: 'cd /bin ; sudo ln -sf dash sh'
[03:51] <sephiron> anyone here use amd athlon fx?
[03:51] <Roy> i know tha the fuckin chavez with his revolution ok mmm but the time?
[03:51] <soundray> timo90: but remember those commands, you may well run into that trouble again.
[03:51] <LjL> !language | roy
[03:51] <ubotu> roy: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:51] <administrator`> LjL: Error: "language" is not a valid command.
[03:51] <plesnivyjano> soundray but i already have 1 working user so it has to be stored somewhere.. and smbpasswd still non existatn

[03:52] <kika> how do i add a locale in edgy eft?
[03:52] <Roy> sorry
[03:52] <fourat> Roy, respect please
[03:52] <cb> my spacebar won't work with gnome (but does fine in KDE).  Where can I go to find out how to fix it?
[03:52] <fourat> kika, dpkg-reconfigure locale ?
[03:52] <timo90> soundray:thanks
[03:52] <Kingsqueak> I wouldn't bother with two machines unless you really need another one
[03:52] <Kingsqueak> wrong win
[03:52] <Roy> sorry ok ok sorry
[03:52] <valehru> DjViper, thanks for the rainbow trick....did the job perfectly.
[03:53] <Roy> it wasnt my intention to make any ofence to nobody just kiding
[03:53] <kika> fourati, does that mean i keep current locale and add another option?
[03:53] <voidmage> Anyone know how to make ut2004 get more than 5fps? (x800, using radeon drivers, trying to avoid fglrx if possible)
[03:53] <fourat> kika, you'll get a checkbox menu were you'll choose your locales
[03:54] <kika> fourati, thanks
[03:54] <fourat> voidmage, why you're trying to avoid it
[03:54] <ryanakca> how do I block all services from the outside except ssh, http and https? I've been messing around with iptables all day with no success... Firestarter and Guarddog are not what I'm looking for. Any suggestions?
[03:54] <sn9> voidmage: the radeon drivers don't support x800 afaik
[03:54] <soundray> voidmage: with an NVidia card. I'm serious, I went down that route :-(
[03:55] <GenNMX> ryanakca: Try qtables.radom.org
[03:55] <fourat> ryanakca, got familiar with iptables and security policies ?
[03:55] <ryanakca> fourat: kindof
[03:55] <ryanakca> GenNMX: kk
[03:55] <ryanakca> ty
[03:55] <voidmage> i can get the radeon drivers to run ut2004, i can even run beryl with the radeon drivers
[03:55] <ryanakca> fourat: why?
[03:55] <voidmage> i just can't get any decent speed more than 5-15 fps out of it
[03:55] <dsl9477> ive done xwd and now i have this screenshot.xwd in my homefolder, whats next?
[03:55] <fourat> ryanakca, to see if you can build your own iptables file
[03:56] <ryanakca> not that good yet...
[03:56] <crxyem> anyone here familiar with slax ??
[03:56] <ryanakca> well, I manually inserted each rule... I guess just add #!/usr/sh at the top of a file, put in those iptables lines, and then chmod +x it?
[03:56] <soundray> dsl9477: 'mogrify -format png screenshot.xwd' (needs imagemagick)
[03:56] <sn9> crxyem: i am, a bit
[03:57] <wilee85> !services
[03:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about services - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:57] <dsl9477> aha, wonderfull ty
[03:57] <crxyem> mind a question??
[03:57] <tonyyarusso> soundray: mogrify?  Please please please say it goes boink!
[03:57] <soundray> tonyyarusso: sorry, I didn't say *trans*mogrify ;)
[03:57] <tonyyarusso> bah
[03:57] <sn9> crxyem: no guarantee i'll know the answer
[03:58] <wilee85> anyone know how to make something automattically start as a service when the computer starts?
[03:58] <mborohov> why is beryl so beautiful?
[03:58] <soundray> tonyyarusso: but the name is, in fact, Watterson-inspired :)
[03:58] <mborohov> i cant get over it
[03:58] <mborohov> lol
[03:58] <timo90> wilee85: yes
[03:58] <sn9> !bum | wilee85
[03:58] <ubotu> wilee85: Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto

[03:59] <alpha255> wilee85: system meun -> admin-> sevices
[03:59] <alpha255> ?
[03:59] <crxyem> I've got slax running as a bootable usbkey, if I modify kde in anyway, nect time I boot I loose my config. any ideas how to save a session
[03:59] <wilee85> tim__b, you were amazingly helpful...
[03:59] <tonyyarusso> crxyem: Maybe in a slax channel?
[04:00] <JairunCaloth> I'm thinking about going wireless on my home network. Does anyone have and suggestions on hardware for my Xubuntu Edgy box?
[04:00] <crxyem> I've tried but that place is dead, no one around for hours on end
[04:00] <timo90> what is hard disk tuning
[04:00] <dsl9477> hm didnt work
[04:00] <FunnyLookinHat> JairunCaloth, avoid broadcomm based chipsets...   intel is best
[04:00] <dsl9477> mogrify...
[04:00] <sn9> crxyem: that kind of stuff is in your home folder. unfortunately, i don't remember how to save a home folder in slax
[04:00] <c_lisp> lstanbul
[04:00] <soundray> wilee85: four answers, and you choose to comment on the one that wasn't helpful. Why not just 'thanks, channel!'
[04:01] <c_lisp> records slow and choppy is there another session recorder program?
[04:01] <soundray> dsl9477: install imagemagick
[04:01] <wilee85> soundray, I just thought it was funny he said yes.
[04:01] <mike-digiport-> I have a switch connected to my serial port, how can I access thsi device so I can send I/O to it with python?
[04:01] <crxyem> I'm using a iwp2200, w/ ndiswrapper, wpa_supplicant, no issues really, and I also have a broadcom card comfigred on my second laptp
[04:01] <dsl9477> apt-get imagemagic?
[04:01] <soundray> dsl9477: 'sudo apt-get install imagemagick' (note the spelling)
[04:01] <dsl9477> ah oke ty
[04:02] <JairunCaloth> is there anything that runs native?
[04:02] <crxyem> sn9 I know it's in the home folder, but changes don't seem to get commited to disk, well I'll see if I can find some more info in there forums
[04:02] <JairunCaloth> for wireless
[04:02] <crxyem> maybe an atheos chipset card
[04:03] <rpereira> Hi, someone knows when madwifi-ng will become default in Ubuntu?
[04:04] <crxyem> if your not usiing wpa, you should really have no problems with a intel card
[04:04] <Hobbsee> rpereira: it's already in linux-restricted-modules
[04:04] <wilee85> but thanks a lot to everyone who helped. especially soundray
[04:04] <JairunCaloth> what is wpa?
[04:04] <soundray> JairunCaloth: most of the well-supported chipsets are sold out now. Best chance is with a Ralink chipset, or Intel
[04:04] <sn9> JairunCaloth: most wireless chipsets can run native, except inprocomm
[04:04] <alpha255> anyone else had a heck of a time with the xorg.conf file after installing the nvidia drivers?
[04:04] <soundray> wilee85: now I'm happy again ;)
[04:04] <alpha255> I had to create it from scratch almost
[04:04] <alpha255> on Edgy
[04:05] <SurfnKid> so whats up doc?
[04:05] <alpha255> the generated file had pointers to the wrong font path, video card and monitor
[04:05] <rpereira> Hobsee: But the madwifi in restriced modules are form madwifi and not madwifi-ng...
[04:05] <crxyem> wpa is an encryption method for wireless networks
[04:05] <mike-digiport->  I have a switch connected to my serial port for console, how can I access thsi device so I can send I/O to it with python?
[04:05] <sn9> JairunCaloth: zydas is the cheapest, and very well supported. ralink is second-cheapest, and the drivers are in a state of flux
[04:05] <alpha255> wpa2 seem better though?
[04:05] <alpha255> right?
[04:06] <Karger1978> anyone ever setup apache2 and phpmyadmin on ubuntu?
[04:06] <Alter-Ego>  /bin/sh can't access tty; job control turned off (initramfs)
[04:07] <Alter-Ego> i get this error when booting up from a cold start
[04:07] <crxyem> wpa2 is a newer method but I'm unaware of any like wpa_supplicant to connect to such an encrypted AP
[04:07] <JairunCaloth> The wireless router shouldn't make much of a difference to linux should it?
[04:07] <JairunCaloth> and what is wpa?
[04:07] <crxyem> the router no, but the encyption yes
[04:08] <ouroboros> Hello all!  I'm trying to get a Logitech Quickcam Fusion working.  The UVC page says it's supported, and the driver compiled fine... still no video from the camera... anyone?  :)
[04:08] <crxyem> most people use wep, which is crackable in hours. wpa a little bit longer to crack
[04:08] <soundray> sn9: never heard zydas - do they come in USB cards?
[04:08] <Roy> does anibody knows the KIBA DOCK?
[04:08] <sn9> JairunCaloth: the router only makes a difference if connected by usb
[04:09] <sn9> soundray: those are usb-only
[04:09] <ryanakca> GenNMX: I wonder why I never found out about quicktables earlier... I was trying to do something manually all day that only took about 5 minutes with it...
[04:09] <JairunCaloth> linux dosn't support wpa?
[04:09] <sn9> JairunCaloth: it does, but not with every chipset
[04:09] <Pelo> ryanakca,  didnT' I give you a link many many hours ago ?
[04:09] <JairunCaloth> sn: ah
[04:10] <ryanakca> Pelo: don't think so...
[04:10] <Pelo> I know I gave it to someone
[04:10] <Pelo> nvm
[04:10] <soundray> sn9: have you got a make&model name handy?
[04:10] <ryanakca> Pelo: you might've and then I lost it... or I missed it... or it got lost when my system went crash...
[04:11] <ryanakca> Pelo: or you might've given it to someone else :)
[04:11] <zelda276> please tell your dad linux is not windows and does not aspire to be so
[04:11] <Pelo> ryanakca,  who ever it was said thanks, but it might have been someone else, I just find it odd
[04:11] <CoRnJuLiOx> can anyone help me get my printer working? it prints the test page, but it won't print from openoffice
[04:11] <sn9> soundray: there are very many. around here, there's a $10 one from AirLink101. don't remember the model#
[04:11] <Pelo> cornell,  are you sure it is properly selected in OO ?
[04:12] <weallone> and dvd and streaming does not work on linux, guess I have to get a real OS like Mac OS X
[04:12] <soundray> sn9: thanks, I'll have a look
[04:12] <CoRnJuLiOx> Pelo: i hit printer settings, and the only printer there is 'generic printer'
[04:12] <sn9> weallone: it's even worse under osx -- i tried
[04:12] <CoRnJuLiOx> its a Canon Pixma MP500
[04:12] <soundray> sn9: fell into the trap of buying unsupported new hardware versions of previously supported nics twice...
[04:13] <Pelo> CoRnJuLiOx,  and the printer appears in the printer windows in  system > admin > printers ?
[04:13] <crxyem> Jairun: not all wireless cards support wpa
[04:14] <alpha255> anyone have beryl working on their nvidia card?
[04:14] <soundray> CoRnJuLiOx: Canon has poor Linux support at the moment. Turboprint drivers work for me.
[04:14] <DarkMageZ> alpha255, please see #beryl :P
[04:15] <alpha255> DarkMageZ: ok
[04:15] <amileft> how to know the path of a link
[04:15] <alpha255> soundray: my hp 6210 all in one works pretty well
[04:15] <alpha255> at least the printing part
[04:15] <alpha255> haven't tried the sane driver to see if scanning works
[04:15] <amileft> how to know the long ath of a link.
[04:15] <amileft> long path of a link
[04:16] <JairunCaloth> how do you find out the chipset of a wireless card?
[04:16] <amileft> i can not see the full path of a ln file
[04:16] <soundray> CoRnJuLiOx: the entry for your printer on linuxprinting.org sounds optimistic, though.
[04:16] <JoshJ> speaking of printers. my parents have a lexmark X73, supposedly works with the driver, doesn't :(
[04:17] <JoshJ> the scanner works, printer doesn't
[04:17] <amileft> the property is /usr/ddfdfd/..... I need to know full path . How
[04:17] <amileft> I right click the ln file and want to know the path of it
[04:17] <amileft> but i faild
[04:17] <amileft> can i know a ln file's real location?
[04:18] <Roy> mmm speakin ok ani class of peripheric
[04:18] <amileft> even the path is long. how to know it
[04:18] <Roy> how can configurate mi web cam?
[04:18] <walden2> hey people. i've recently installed edgy. i changed my screen resolution to 1024x768 at 75 hz. but when i reboot, it gets all messed up, i go again into the resolution thing and it si set at 100 hz. what can i do to get the resolution i want?
[04:18] <amileft> i put a link on my Desktop but I want to know where to find it
[04:19] <alpha255> walden2: is there  a checkbox that you can check?
[04:19] <alpha255> on
[04:19] <Roy> it seem so ugli and i can not use the options brigtness or contrats or saturation, hue etc.. because it doesn work at all
[04:19] <Pelo> amileft,  my guess is the link on your desktop will be located on your desktop
[04:19] <JoshJ> amileft: right click on it and hit properties
[04:19] <JoshJ> somewhere in there it will show you where the link goes
[04:19] <walden2> yes it is. is something like "use as default for this machine"
[04:19] <amileft> the real path is long so it is replace with ...
[04:20] <amileft> properties can not see full path
[04:20] <walden2> should i check that?
[04:20] <alpha255> walden2: did yo check it before closing the dialog box?
[04:20] <walden2> i guess not
[04:20] <amileft> it is a link
[04:20] <Pelo> amileft, copy paste the path to gedit,  ... will probably be replaced with the proper txt
[04:21] <madman91> amileft: yea.. ls -l THELINKFILE
[04:21] <amileft> i will try
[04:21] <madman91> amileft: i think that works

[04:26] <shooters> decode: edgy?
[04:26] <Nameeater> I would at a guess that it is the variable irc_who_join so try /set irc_who_join 0
[04:26] <alpha255> must be dapper
[04:26] <Nameeater> at a guess say*
[04:26] <decode> im pretty sure
[04:26] <Moosejaw> can someone help me with ndiswrapper??/
[04:26] <sn9> Nameeater: that's something else entirely

[04:26] <CoRnJuLiOx> i can't ftp:// in firefox, can i.
[04:27] <P2K> i see * Save Transcript, leave, close, auto-join, find and bans...
[04:27] <alpha255> CoRnJuLiOx: sure
[04:27] <Moosejaw> when i installed other things it found the files fine on the net...and it wont do the same with ndiswrapper
[04:27] <Nameeater> sn9: bummer ;)
[04:27] <alpha255> CoRnJuLiOx: just no uploads
[04:27] <amileft> it seems i need to copy your name to let it show i am chat with you
[04:27] <madman91> amileft: no
[04:27] <sn9> P2K: do you see the channel name ("#ubuntu")?
[04:27] <CoRnJuLiOx> alpha255: thansk
[04:27] <madman91> amileft: type .. mad .. then press TAB
[04:27] <CoRnJuLiOx> thanks*
[04:27] <madman91> it will finish the name
[04:27] <shooters> decode: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox
[04:27] <P2K> yup, and i right-clicked on it
[04:28] <madman91> amileft: type in the first 3 letters.. or so .. then press TAB and it will finish the name
[04:28] <alpha255> what's the preferred ftp client in edgy?
[04:28] <alpha255> gftp?
[04:28] <hikenboot> hello all-- i asked this earlier looking for different answers ..my nic cards start numbered from eth1 to eth2 eth0 doesnt show up even with ifconfig -a any ideas why?
[04:28] <amileft> madalin,

[04:29] <madman91> amileft: when there is two people with mad .. it will complete both,,, so press tab until you get the one you want
[04:29] <madman91> amileft: you can change that
[04:29] <Nameeater>  /set irc_conf_mode 1 but you have to rejoin your channels to make it work ^^
[04:29] <shooters> decode: did it work?
[04:29] <amileft> is it same?
[04:29] <decode> no
[04:30] <shooters> goto http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/firefox and download the script and execute it

[04:30] <amileft> madman91, is it is same use , or : for you ?
[04:30] <shooters> it will download the tarball and install it

[04:32] <amileft> madman91,  wich one you perfer? AIM
[04:32] <madman91> amileft: AIM is fine
[04:32] <shooters> bobby: did you install through deb/synaptic or through tarball?
[04:32] <alpha255> gaim works for me :)
=== decode is now known as decoded
[04:32] <amileft> madman91,  AIM has linux version?
=== decoded is now known as d3cod3
[04:33] <madman91> amileft: yes.. but you should use gaim or kopete...
[04:33] <madman91> amileft: do you have gnome ?
[04:33] <amileft> madman91,  I have gaim
[04:33] <bobby> sysnaptic it's up on running ,i would like to try of the eyecandy
[04:33] <madman91> amileft: open up gaim.. and setup a user account for AIM

[04:37] <NDPowerBook> Ooops wrong channel
[04:37] <CoRnJuLiOx> wow
[04:37] <shooters> bobby: http://www.enlightenment.org/
[04:37] <bobby> shooter : i tried the wiki not a lot of help
[04:37] <doobit> I need help to NOT shop
[04:38] <Raptor316> is enlightenment still around?
[04:39] <pianoboy3333> Raptor316: yep
[04:39] <pianoboy3333> enlightenment.org I think
[04:39] <sn9> bobby: sudo apt-get install enlightenment
[04:39] <alpha255> e is pretty cool eye candy
[04:39] <Raptor316> man I havent thought about enlightenment in a long time
[04:40] <jbroome> alpha255: yeah, but it makes me grit my teeth
[04:40] <alpha255> jbroome: why?
[04:40] <doobit> There's a whole distro based on it. http://www.elivecd.org/
[04:40] <bobby> i have e16 install and working ,i need to config some of the cool features
[04:42] <Megaqwerty> Does anyone know if there is any kind of Parental Control software (free or cheap) for Ubuntu?
[04:42] <alpha255> squid in front of the box :)
[04:42] <alpha255> proxy server that can limit content
[04:42] <Raptor316> thanks for the link doobit
[04:42] <madman91> Megaqwerty: .. i am not being snooty :) .. but you can probably google research it
[04:43] <alpha255> maybe it should be rnamed  to calimari(sp) ;)
[04:43] <jbroome> i think dansguardian is the program/plugin that filters the nasty stuff
[04:43] <mborohov> so i figured something out now
[04:43] <mborohov> the reason my sound wasnt working earlier
[04:43] <sn9> Megaqwerty: there are several types of such software, but in nearly all cases the software pkg that would do the best job is one called "squid"
[04:43] <Megaqwerty> madman91: no, I have been doing that for a while, the closest I came was Ubuntu Christian Edition, which claimed to have it, but I don't want to get that.
[04:43] <mborohov> for some reason, at first i dont have permission to use it
[04:43] <jbroome> calamaris - log analyzer for Squid or Oops proxy log files
[04:43] <mborohov> but if i go:
[04:43] <Megaqwerty> thank you for all of your help!
[04:43] <mborohov> sudo aplay
[04:44] <nayru> Hi, Im having trouble installing w32codecs...can anyone help?
[04:44] <mborohov> and kill it, i can use it as my normal user without a problem
[04:44] <JoshJ> how... odd
[04:44] <JoshJ> !w32codecs
[04:44] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:44] <madman91> Megaqwerty: im just saying.. for easier problems.. google is the faster answer... im not saying anything.. just adding to the possible list of things to ttry
[04:44] <nayru> thanx
[04:45] <ryanakca> why is it that when I commit something to my local svn, the files get changed to ryan:ryan instead of remaning www-data:subversion? ( 4.0K -rwxrwx--- 1 ryan ryan 6 2006-11-24 22:36 /var/svn-repos/myproject/db/current        vs.       4.0K -rwxrwx--- 1 web-data subversion 6 2006-11-24 22:36 /var/svn-repos/myproject/db/current )... it needs to have www-data:subversion so that websvn works
[04:45] <Megaqwerty> madman91: I know, and I'm saying, that that is always what I try first.
[04:45] <sn9> Megaqwerty: the only difference between the christian edition and regular ubuntu, to my knowledge, is that in one, gnome-sword is preinstalled, and in the other, you install it from a menu
[04:45] <mborohov> sorry about that, did i miss much?
[04:45] <alpha255> ryanakca: maybe set the user bit on that directory?
[04:45] <madman91> Megaqwerty: well.. good luck with your problem
[04:46] <JoshJ> mborohov: no
[04:46] <Megaqwerty> lol, thanks
[04:46] <mborohov> but yeah, its almost the sound needs to be accessed by root FIRST before being accessed by a regular user
[04:46] <mborohov> any ideas?
[04:46] <JoshJ> was going to tell you that you could chmod (or maybe chown it)
[04:46] <ryanakca> alpha255: 4.0K drwxrwx--- 5 www-data subversion 4.0K 2006-11-24 22:36 db           ?
[04:46] <JoshJ> chmod it to be read-executable by anyone i guess
[04:46] <ortega10> i need a good bittorrent client other than azureus, any ideas?
[04:46] <mborohov> JoshJ: chmod what?
[04:46] <JoshJ> uh, whatever the thing is you were killing
[04:47] <JoshJ> !bittorrent
[04:47] <ubotu> bittorrent: Scatter-gather network file transfer. In component main, is optional. Version 3.4.2-6ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 90 kB, installed size 556 kB
[04:47] <mborohov> aplay?
[04:47] <Nameeater> bittornado
[04:47] <mborohov> well, i mean...it CAN be run by anyone, but only after its been run by root once first
[04:47] <JoshJ> that's odd
[04:47] <JoshJ> i assume it's /usr/bin/aplay ?
[04:47] <mborohov> and its a+x right now
[04:47] <mborohov> yeah
[04:47] <JoshJ> hrm
[04:47] <alpha255> ryanakca: g+s for that directory
[04:47] <sn9> ortega10: the other one that even comes close to azureus is windows-only
[04:47] <alpha255> manybe
[04:47] <JoshJ> how odd
[04:47] <mborohov> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 97110 2006-11-24 19:02 aplay
[04:48] <P2K> you dont like azureus ?
[04:48] <JoshJ> shouldn't that last x be xr?
[04:48] <ortega10> sn9: well azureus is crashy and takes too much resources so i've decided to leave it
[04:48] <agent> is there a manual/tutorial for including *.mo files in a deb?
[04:48] <ryanakca> alpha255: sudo chown g+s -R /var/svn-repos/myproject/ ?
[04:48] <ortega10> sn9: i tried transmission and liked it, but i've read it's banned in many trackers
[04:48] <digitalhav0c> i hate azureus
[04:48] <digitalhav0c> azureus
[04:48] <sn9> ortega10: you can try gnome-torrent, but you'll probably come right back
[04:48] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: what do you suggest then
[04:48] <digitalhav0c> its a memory hog
[04:49] <P2K> im not having any issues with azureus, but my klibido is crashing every so often, hehe
[04:49] <digitalhav0c> Utorrent all the way
[04:49] <alpha255> ryanakca: test it out first, but something like that might work
[04:49] <ryanakca> alpha255: or sudo chmod g+s -R /var/svn-repos/myproject/ ?
[04:49] <digitalhav0c> through wine
[04:49] <ortega10> sn9: gnome-torrent is too simple, i can't even download two torrents at the same time
[04:49] <digitalhav0c> ;)
[04:49] <mborohov> JoshJ: what are your perms on it?
[04:49] <JoshJ> dunno, let me check
[04:49] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: thanks but no way i'm gonna use a non-free-software windows client  :)
[04:49] <ortega10> *windows-only
[04:49] <digitalhav0c> utorrent is free
[04:49] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: i said free software
[04:49] <digitalhav0c> wine is open source
[04:50] <JoshJ> !wine
[04:50] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: not free as in beer
[04:50] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:50] <JoshJ> hrm
[04:50] <JoshJ> WINE isn't Free?
[04:50] <Raptor316> utorrent is pretty sweet
[04:50] <ortega10> JoshJ: wine is
[04:50] <P2K> !klibido
[04:50] <ubotu> klibido: usenet binary grabber for KDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.5-2ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 411 kB, installed size 1336 kB
[04:50] <ortega10> JoshJ: but he said utorrent
[04:50] <JoshJ> ah
[04:50] <TraceGreen> Hello, my sound card is 8086:27d8 and driver is snd-hda-intel, but no sound at all! alsamixier can just see pcm
[04:50] <digitalhav0c> its open source
[04:50] <digitalhav0c> not free two different things
[04:50] <JoshJ> grr, what's the command for checking the permissions in a terminal?
[04:50] <digitalhav0c> utorrent if free as in beer
[04:50] <digitalhav0c> im actually drinking one
[04:51] <digitalhav0c> now
[04:51] <sn9> JoshJ: ls -l
[04:51] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: not free in the sense of free software
[04:51] <mborohov> JoshJ: ls -l /usr/bin/aplay
[04:51] <JoshJ> hrm
[04:51] <JoshJ> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 47704 2006-07-30 21:51 aplay
[04:51] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: so i'd rather pass on it unless i couldn't find any other alternatives
[04:51] <mborohov> so, same
[04:51] <JoshJ> yeah
[04:51] <JoshJ> odd
[04:51] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: right now i'm pretty happy with transmission
[04:51] <mborohov> anyone else have any ideas?
[04:51] <digitalhav0c> try it
[04:52] <vik> How can I create a user that has no password?
[04:52] <doobit> I have been having a hard time setting bittorrent to seed, though it downloads great,
[04:52] <P2K> are there any other usenet grabber with GUI aside form klibido that are any good ?
[04:52] <alpha255> vik: why?
[04:53] <vik> To create a user 'off' that will shut down the computer immediately; its for a print server laptop which a dead monitor. So no securtiy issues
[04:53] <Megaqwerty> To everybody who helped me figure out how to get Parental Control for linux, thank you once again, I have found a software "Dansguardian" which is a graphical front-end for squid, and will help me greatly in persuading my father to allow my sister to have linux.
[04:54] <doobit> Ubuntu CE has DansGuardian included
[04:54] <alpha255> vik: ahh ok
[04:54] <Megaqwerty> doobit: I just realized that.
[04:54] <digitalhav0c> yedoobit
[04:54] <sn9> Megaqwerty: i was about to mention dansguardian, but it does limit what squid can do
[04:54] <digitalhav0c> doobit are you behind a router?
[04:54] <ortega10> so no one knows a good bittorrent client for ubuntu other than azureus?
[04:54] <Megaqwerty> sn9: how so?
[04:54] <JoshJ> i think you just remove the password in /etc/passwd or something like that, i'm sure there's a guide somewhere
[04:55] <Megaqwerty> ortega10: there is freeloader, and Ktorrent
[04:55] <doobit> Yes. I have a router, but the firewall is turned off
[04:55] <digitalhav0c> ortega10, i use deluge some time
[04:55] <digitalhav0c> s
[04:55] <Megaqwerty> ortega10: and bittorrent
[04:55] <vik> I have done it previously by removing the second field in /etc/passwd, but no longer seems to work
[04:55] <user-land> ktorrent, but it is buggy, ortega10
[04:55] <ortega10> digitalhav0c: i tried deluge, looks good
[04:55] <ivx> hey i sometime when i try to open the nautilus, it will say opening home folder or what ever i try to open, then it just hang there and then closes, any idea what's up, if i reboot it works again, is there anything else to do?
[04:55] <Megaqwerty> ortega10: take your pick ;-)
[04:55] <Pelo> who was it talking about utorrent earlier ?  I have a guide to set it up on wine
[04:55] <digitalhav0c> it works is all i can say other than that i use utorrent :)
[04:55] <ortega10> Megaqwerty: thanks  ;)
[04:55] <mikeymike-linux> anyone know how to get the awe32 working in dapper?
[04:55] <sn9> Megaqwerty: the possibilities of squid probably exceed your imagination. lemme get you an example link...
[04:55] <mikeymike-linux> i know this is a quick answer
[04:55] <spo0nman2> I want to control my mouse with my bluetooth cellphone ... are there any howto's or applications to do this?
[04:55] <Megaqwerty> ortega10: ur welcome
[04:56] <Pelo> for utorrent on wine if anyone still cares   http://www.securenet.net/members/jeanpelo/linux_guide.html
[04:56] <mikeymike-linux> ok i know someone who had an sb16 in dapper they have recently upgraded to the awe32 and it doesn't work..... what steps need to be take to make it work?
[04:56] <alpha255> vik: I think you'd add the user and then edit the /etc/shadow
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[04:56] <vik> alpha255: tried both, neither worked
[04:56] <Megaqwerty> sn9: thanks
[04:57] <sn9> Megaqwerty: http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pete/upside-down-ternet.html
[04:57] <Megaqwerty> sn9: oh, I know all about that one
[04:57] <Megaqwerty> sn9: absolute hilarity
[04:58] <Megaqwerty> sn9: that was done with squid?
[04:58] <sn9> yes indeedy
[04:58] <Megaqwerty> sweet
[04:58] <sn9> at least that's what it says
[04:58] <Megaqwerty> as I see
[04:59] <ortega10> well thanks to all, bye
[04:59] <mikeymike-linux> ok i know someone who had an sb16 in dapper they have recently upgraded to the awe32 and it doesn't work..... what steps need to be take to make it work?
[04:59] <Oni-Dracula> gots a problem with the nvidia beta drivers.... they cause Xorg to crash signal 11
[04:59] <Pelo> mikeymike-linux,   look awe32 in the forum
[05:00] <alpha255> vik: create the user and remove the x in the /etc/passwd file ... big warning that is a security hole though.
[05:00] <CoRnJuLiOx> the font size when printing in OO looks all wrong. i set size 12, but it looks like a 9, and size 16 looks like a 10
[05:00] <alpha255> vik: the x for that user
[05:00] <vik> alpha255: tried that; not luck. Think it has something to do with PAM
[05:00] <vik> s/not/no/
[05:00] <Pelo> CoRnJuLiOx,  did you try printing with gedit to see if the result is similar ?
[05:02] <Staz> Hi, I think I have set up my wireless on my laptop ok, I can do ping -I eth1 192.168.1.1 , but I cant browse the web. ping urls etc.

[05:05] <family> vi /etc/inittab gives me nada (nothing)

[05:08] <kishan> TraceGreen ,did u try using live cd and check wheter the sound card is working
[05:08] <Roger_The_Bum> !qt
[05:08] <ubotu> qt is the Q toolkit, which forms the base of KDE and a lot of other applications. For the Qt includes, install the libqt3-mt-dev package.
[05:08] <TraceGreen> kishan, yeah, I use knoppix and ubuntu, both work

[05:12] <varsis> would someone be able to tell me the command in OSX (or linux) to change a HFS+ partition to a HFS so I can resize it? I tried 'diskutil disablejournal /' in OSX, but when I went into gparted in a live cd, it showed the partition type as HFS+ still
[05:12] <solo> ne thing else i got to go
[05:13] <sn9> varsis: hfs+ cannot be changed to hfs, period. turning off journaling is enough, but resizing cannot be done graphically
[05:13] <nayru> Anyone know how I can make vim color code my C programs?
[05:13] <varsis> sn9: ack, no gfx... ah.. there goes the lazy way out
[05:13] <varsis> straight up fdisk use?
[05:13] <sn9> varsis: parted, not fdisk
[05:14] <varsis> the ubuntu installer can handle this?
[05:14] <Drone4four> how do i take a screenshot of my desktop?
[05:14] <masterninja> help
[05:14] <solo> alt+ printscreen
[05:14] <masterninja> how do i install nvidia drivers through synaptic
=== yama_away is now known as yama
[05:14] <sn9> varsis: the installer discs have the console parted, but you must start it manually. also, as you know, journaling must be turned off first
[05:14] <kitche> nayru: :syntax on or :highlight on try one of those options
[05:14] <masterninja> i forgot how to do it
[05:15] <solo> sn9: any suggestions?
[05:15] <varsis> yep, gotcha. Thanks :)
[05:15] <sn9> solo: did installing the fwcutter ask you where the windows driver is?
[05:15] <masterninja> how do i install nvidia drivers through synaptic?
[05:16] <solo> no i used the .deb file...    it just installed and away it went
[05:16] <solo> didnt ask for a INF or a sys or nuttin
[05:16] <sn9> masterninja: you need the pkg called nvidia-glx
[05:16] <bobby> use automatic to install nvidia drivers
[05:16] <timo90> ATI drivers worked =-O
[05:16] <lufis> When I try adding the clock applet to the Gnome panel, I get this error: The panel encountered a problem while loading "OAFIID:GNOME_ClockApplet".
[05:16] <masterninja> kk
[05:16] <masterninja> what are the commads to activate it?
[05:16] <sn9> !automatix | bobby
[05:16] <ubotu> bobby: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:16] <masterninja> the bit i forgot is what you have to put in the terminal
[05:17] <sn9> !nvidia | masterninja
[05:17] <ubotu> masterninja: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:17] <masterninja> thx
[05:18] <sn9> solo: then the fwcutter installed, but didn't run
[05:20] <sn9> solo: in a Terminal window, type: sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter
[05:23] <CoRnJuLiOx> if i have an RPM package i want to install, do i grab alien and convert it to .deb, or do i just get .rpm and use that directly?
[05:24] <kitche> CoRnJuLiOx: what's the rpm for?
[05:26] <shooters> CoRnJuLiOx: you need to alien first
[05:27] <AtKaaZ> hi, there seems to be some kind of bug in php 5.1.2 which is the latest on i386 server version of ubuntu; any idea on how to request from the staff to make an update to ie. php 5.1.6 which doesn't have the bug ?
[05:27] <kitche> !launchpad|AtKaaZ
[05:27] <ubotu> AtKaaZ: launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's Bounty and Bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/

[05:38] <foo_> What channel do you go to if you need to recover your #ubuntu nickname password?
[05:38] <dabaR> foo_: not possible.
[05:38] <aidanr> someone help me out with a test, pm me in 5 seconds
[05:39] <foo_> Unrecoverable?
[05:39] <DarkMageZ> it's recoverable... you just need alot of computing power or time
[05:39] <foo_> What? Like a brute force?
[05:39] <timo90> cpu
[05:40] <DarkMageZ> yeah, you'd be better resetting the password
[05:40] <Pelo> foo_,  if usr/pswd were easy to recover it wouldn't very secure
[05:40] <foo_> true.
[05:40] <aidanr> \o/ it worked, beryl water ripple over xchat systray icon on private message
[05:40] <solo> and if it was MD5 ud be screwed
[05:40] <solo> lol
[05:40] <jbroome> you realize he's talking about his IRC nickserv PW, right?
[05:41] <DarkMageZ> oh
[05:41] <foo_> I saved it in a password manager. Had it generate a crazy secure password. Then re-installed 6.10 without  copying password.
[05:41] <timo90> beryl water ripple over xchat systray icon on private message: sounds cool
[05:41] <foo_> Yes. IRC nickserv pass
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> foo_: You can contact a staff member and have them reset it for you
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> !ntfs
[05:42] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[05:42] <solo> sn9:  You their by chance lol??
[05:42] <PinkFloyd> !fuse
[05:42] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[05:42] <foo_> The ops in this channel? What channel do I need to go to?'
[05:42] <solo> foo_  hold on
[05:42] <tonyyarusso> foo_: Normally /stats -p I think is what tells you who's on - but I don't see any output with that atm
[05:43] <tonyyarusso> foo_: Without the hyphen rather
[05:43] <solo> foo_   :  u used to be abled to do it through nickserv,   in an older servver i knew u could go to #nickserv..   but that aint here...
[05:43] <jbroome> try #freenode-social
[05:43] <dabaR> foo_: you can not get the password back, how would they know it is really you?
[05:43] <foo_> Ill just make a new nick. Easier.
[05:43] <PinkFloyd> My friend is trying to install Ubuntu on an NTFS hard drive. !ntfs and !fuse dont seem to be what Im looking for. He's using the Alternate Install and cannot install it graphically. What can I tell him to do to partition his NTFS hard drive to run Ubuntu?
[05:43] <foo_> I know. Oh well.
[05:44] <tonyyarusso> dabaR: Maybe they'd be able to match the host to a past ident?
[05:44] <sn9> !ntfs-3g | PinkFloyd
[05:44] <ubotu> PinkFloyd: ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[05:44] <jbroome> PinkFloyd: when the partitioner comes up he's going to want to "use free space" to install ubuntu
[05:44] <timo90> When i have high CPU usage i get a high pitched noise
[05:44] <dabaR> PinkFloyd: he wants to install on an ntfs partition?
[05:45] <PinkFloyd> dabaR: His current drive is NTFS. I went to install it and it had no free space.
[05:45] <sn9> PinkFloyd: oh, for shrinking?
[05:45] <CoRnJuLiOx> damnit, does anyone here happen to have cnijfilter-common-2.60-1.i386.rpm and cnjifilter-mp500-2.60-1.i386.rpm?
[05:45] <dabaR> PinkFloyd: create some space
[05:45] <mister_roboto> PinkFloyd: if he has no space, something has to go :)
[05:45] <PinkFloyd> sn9: I need to create free space so I can install it
[05:45] <mister_roboto> PinkFloyd: or tell him to buy a second drive
[05:45] <CoRnJuLiOx> the FTP you download them from isn't working, and i know of no other place to get them.
[05:45] <PinkFloyd> Mister_Roboto: I tried resizing with the partitioner, but it didnt work.
[05:45] <sn9> PinkFloyd: that's easy if you know how, but a bit tricky to explain
[05:45] <dabaR> PinkFloyd: there is a resize option in the installed once you delete some files
[05:46] <mister_roboto> PinkFloyd: drives are very cheap. that might be easiest
[05:46] <jbroome> PinkFloyd: the installer isn't going to magically add more space to his drive.  tell your friend to delete some windows crap
[05:46] <PinkFloyd> Ive got Partition Magic, that should work
[05:46] <sn9> PinkFloyd: it involves a few reboots
[05:46] <PinkFloyd> I used Partition Magic on my Win98 computer, it's a FAT32 though
[05:46] <sn9> PinkFloyd: partition magic will destroy your ntfs
[05:46] <PinkFloyd> oh >_>
[05:46] <timo90> Are sata drives relly fast ?
[05:46] <PinkFloyd> I'll tell him to get another drive then
[05:46] <timo90> i have IDE at the moment
[05:46] <madman91> i have 10krpm 74gb sata
[05:47] <dabaR> PinkFloyd: the ubuntu installed has a resize program that you can use once you clean up some space
[05:47] <timo90> is it fast is what i asked
[05:47] <c_lisp> whats a good java ide and compiler?
[05:47] <PinkFloyd> ok thanks
[05:47] <solo> sn9: whats the proper [OPTIONS]   to use with fwcutter??
[05:48] <solo> (looking for a managable drivers version in the meantime)
[05:48] <kitche> c_lisp: eclipse
[05:48] <timo90> but how can 50 mb/s make such a big inprovement
[05:48] <c_lisp> thanks
[05:49] <timo90> just dont get it
[05:49] <Firefishe> I installed my bcm4xx drivers with the -w option in fwcutter, but that might not be your baliwick, I have a powerPc
[05:49] <dabaR> c_lisp: the sun java jdk is an OK java compiler.
[05:49] <kitche> dabaR: well eclipse uses the jdk anyways
[05:50] <dabaR> kitche: I agree.
[05:50] <dabaR> kitche: it is not a compiler however, so I gave him a compiler to go with the IDE
[05:51] <c_lisp> ill check it out
[05:51] <Fall2Hell> i need help
[05:51] <Fall2Hell> someone?
[05:51] <dabaR> !helpme
[05:51] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:52] <Fall2Hell> well when i try to boot the install cd
[05:52] <Fall2Hell> it gives an error
[05:52] <Fall2Hell> about some i/q
[05:52] <Fall2Hell> and it stays like that one and one
[05:52] <Fall2Hell> and i cant install ubuntu
[05:53] <Fall2Hell> !helpme
[05:53] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:53] <wikityle1> ping
[05:53] <dabaR> the boot CD never boots?
[05:54] <Fall2Hell> it starts to but when i chose star or install ubuntu
[05:54] <Fall2Hell> it gives the i/q error
[05:54] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: make a check on the CD, it is an option there
[05:54] <dabaR> in the installation menu
[05:54] <Fall2Hell> i did it
[05:54] <Fall2Hell> and same error
[05:55] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: that would likely mean something is wrong with the CD. did you burn the CD from a .iso file?
[05:55] <Fall2Hell> yep
[05:55] <ortega10> does anyone know a nice gui for checking md5 hashes?
[05:55] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: I guess that was not even necessary to ask...did you check the md5sum of the .iso file you have?
[05:56] <dabaR> ortega10: in Ubuntu?
[05:56] <Fall2Hell> dabar: nop
[05:56] <sethk> Fall2Hell, doing the check from the menu doesn't verify that the cd is good.  it can sometimes say the cd is bad, but it can't guarantee that the cd is good.
[05:56] <ortega10> dabaR: yes of course, i don't like going offtopic  :)
[05:56] <sethk> Fall2Hell, so you should check the md5sum of the downloaded .iso file also
[05:56] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: are you in windows?
[05:56] <sethk> Fall2Hell, if that doesn't help, do the text mode install from the alternate cd
[05:57] <Fall2Hell> yes im at windows
[05:57] <sethk> ortega10, I can't imagine using a gui for that.  doing it at the command line is so much easier.
[05:57] <c_lisp> hey anybody every tried programming in D?
[05:57] <ortega10> sethk: ok so you don't know any, thanks anyway
[05:57] <Fall2Hell> gona check the file
[05:57] <sethk> ortega10, I do know, actually.
[05:57] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: you know how?
[05:57] <ortega10> sethk: well then why didn't you answer my question?  :)
[05:58] <sethk> ortega10, I thought you might be interested in a qucker way of doing it.
[05:58] <Fall2Hell> dabar: not really
[05:58] <dabaR> or more importantly, will you?
[05:58] <ortega10> sethk: ok thanks then, i know the commandline way, but sometimes i don't feel like pulling a console down
[05:59] <ortega10> sethk: could you please tell me the one you know?
[05:59] <sethk> ortega10, yes, I'm looking for it.  I've seen it on this box, I just have to remember where.
[05:59] <ortega10> sethk: ok i'll wait, thanks
[06:00] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: sorry, had to find a link, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/iso shows how to check near the bottom.
[06:00] <thrillin`> anyone around
[06:01] <Pelo> NO
[06:01] <Fall2Hell> dabar: k gona check the link
[06:01] <thrillin`> :(
[06:01] <sethk> thrillin`, I'm not
[06:01] <yoshibot> would anyone know what kind of raster fonts X supports?
[06:01] <solo> any one got a bcm34xx   driver that works???   mine are all either impossible for fwcutter or to new dew to some issues ive been reading with broadcom cards having a flaw....
[06:01] <thrillin`> i'm a pelb user of linux
[06:01] <ortega10> sethk: is it ghasher?  i just found this one on google...
[06:01] <dabaR> ortega10: check out this interesting info... http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/using_md5sums.html
[06:01] <Pelo> thrillin`,  what is a pelb user ?
[06:02] <thrillin`> level below noob
[06:02] <thrillin`> lol
[06:02] <Pelo> ouch
[06:02] <dabaR> haha
[06:02] <thrillin`> :(
[06:02] <Epidemik> can i change my username?
[06:02] <Pelo> http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84
[06:02] <Pelo> thrillin`,  that was for you
[06:02] <dabaR> Epidemik: your ubuntu user name?
[06:02] <thrillin`> i have a powerbook g4
[06:02] <sethk> ortega10, no, I think what I'm remembering is that I mapped something in kde to do it, I think control right click.  I'll find it eventually.  if ghasher does what you need, though, go for it.
[06:02] <yoshibot> solo: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Installation
[06:03] <ortega10> sethk: ok thanks anyway
[06:03] <thrillin`> hmm
[06:03] <Pelo> thrillin`,  so a noob with money,  go on
[06:03] <thrillin`> lolz
[06:03] <Epidemik> dabaR i think i got it
[06:03] <thrillin`> haha @ with money
[06:03] <dabaR> Epidemik: cool
[06:03] <thrillin`> a noob who saves
[06:03] <Epidemik> is it bad to change my name if im only user?
[06:03] <yoshibot> solo: native linux drivers are locked at 11mbps, which imo is slow
[06:03] <Epidemik> I used  to share this computer with a friend, now i dont so i want to protect it
[06:03] <thrillin`> my Ipod was lonely
[06:03] <Pelo> thrillin`,  seriously, if you have an issue,   ask your question, in one paragraph,  and we'll try to elp
[06:03] <thrillin`> i mac is for designing work only
[06:03] <thrillin`> ok
[06:04] <sethk> ortega10, the URL dabaR gave you I think is probably easier than other alternatives.
[06:04] <dabaR> Epidemik: make sure your new user is in the admin group. How are you going to change the name?
[06:04] <thrillin`> i just want to know how to run ubuntu off the cd on my powerbook
[06:04] <thrillin`> i could probably figure out the rest after i guess
[06:04] <dabaR> thrillin`: download the ubuntu desktop ppc CD from releases.ubuntu.com
[06:05] <thrillin`> it in my cd drive already
[06:05] <Epidemik> dabaR I went  Main Menu=>System=>Administration=>Users highlighted username and clicked properties
[06:05] <thrillin`> :)
[06:05] <Pelo> thrillin`,  easy enough, just put in the cd and boot from it , but as far as saving yoursettings that is another matter, , ther eis probably a tutorial in the forum
[06:05] <dabaR> Epidemik: and it allows for a name change?
[06:05] <Epidemik> dabaR yes
[06:05] <thrillin`> how i bootin from cd on a mac?
[06:05] <dabaR> thrillin`: hold down the c key while booting, or sometimes the apple key
[06:05] <Pelo> thrillin`,  ah, now there is a question I can't answer
[06:05] <thrillin`> thx
[06:05] <dabaR> ya you can now
[06:06] <thrillin`> i'll be back
[06:06] <Pelo> dabaR,  but I didn'T want to know
[06:06] <thrillin`> i wanna buy amac book pro
[06:06] <Epidemik> thrillin` i think option shows a list of everything you can boot from
[06:06] <dabaR> Epidemik: wow, it really does allow that...
[06:06] <Epidemik> dabaR yup is that bad?
[06:06] <Epidemik> dabaR lol, i can change everything about the user
[06:07] <adam> testing
[06:07] <adam> anyone in here
[06:07] <Epidemik> so the main usergroup should be admin?
[06:07] <Epidemik> yes
[06:07] <dabaR> Epidemik: well, it is a feature included in the stable release, so I guess it is safe, and it keeps track of all the changes necessary, pretty cool.
[06:07] <adam> or is this even a chat room
[06:07] <adam> ah
[06:07] <sethk> adam, I'm not here
[06:07] <adam> oh ok
[06:07] <adam> first time
[06:07] <Epidemik> dabaR; can i change the name of my computer
[06:07] <dabaR> Epidemik: well, the user will stay in all the same groups if it works properly.
[06:07] <adam> i just found this on my ubunto

[06:07] <dabaR> Epidemik: well, I heard it was not easy, but so I heard for user name change too.
[06:07] <Epidemik> good luck thrillin`

[06:07] <thrillin`> yay!
[06:08] <Epidemik> How can i change the name of my computer?
[06:08] <thrillin`> thx
[06:08] <Epidemik> !computer name
[06:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about computer name - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:08] <Epidemik> dabaR thanks, ill brb see if this works
[06:10] <Epidemik> dabaR username changed but the password and home directory didnt
[06:10] <rokko> excuse me: how do i uninstall a program i installed with "make install"
[06:11] <dabaR> !hostname | Epidemik
[06:11] <ubotu> Epidemik: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[06:11] <kitche> Epidemik: it's called hostname
[06:11] <Pelo> anyone know where I can get a list of the colours for xchat so I can change them ?
[06:11] <Epidemik> okay
[06:11] <Epidemik> thanks
[06:11] <kitche> Pelo: in preferences
[06:11] <mborohov> so now that ive got beryl working, i feel so uninspired :p
[06:11] <dabaR> Epidemik: well, I think you have to change the dir name yourself, then. the mv command will rename. You can do something like sudo mv /home/old /home/new if /home/new does not already exist.
[06:11] <Pelo> kitche,   I know that bit but the list there doesn' tell you what the colours are
[06:12] <jdjs69> mborohov: which version of beryl?
[06:12] <Epidemik> okay
[06:12] <CVirus> After I upgraded to dapper .. my fstab changed to something like UID=2526477578 ... How can I get the UID of a certain partition inorder to add it to my fstab ?
[06:12] <CVirus> upgraded to edgy*
[06:13] <kitche> Pelo: what do you mean there is red grey light grey black lime blue, and even says what the colors are used for
=== yama is now known as yama_away
[06:13] <Epidemik> okay thanks guys
[06:13] <Pelo> kitche,  I mean what colours are used for
[06:13] <sethk> CVirus, if it's a windows partition, the uid isn't associated with the partition, it's something you tell mount so mount fakes things out as if user UID owns the files.
[06:13] <dabaR> CVirus: I find the device nodes still work in etc/fstab, blkid <nodeName> will tell you the UUID.
[06:13] <Epidemik> restarting be back in a min, if i didnt break my computer
[06:13] <dabaR> !uuid > CVirus
[06:14] <sethk> oh, he said uid, but meant uuid
[06:14] <Fall2Hell> dabaR: ive checked it the iso its ok
[06:14] <Sir_Brizz> does anyone know how to fix VNC problems? It's not letting me run the server, I'm getting an error: "could not open default font 'fixed'"
[06:14] <kitche> Pelo: hmm my xchat says what the colours are used for but I m using Xchat and not xchat-gnome
[06:14] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: well, I can not think of much else to do about this particular .iso other than burning another CD. YOu can try the alternate CD download if you have the desktop now, or vise versa.
[06:14] <Pelo> kitche,  samehere butI got my answer from #xchat, tanks
[06:15] <timo90> see you later guys bye
[06:15] <Fall2Hell> dabaR: the laternate cd how do i install it is it bootable?
[06:16] <Fall2Hell> dabaR, never used it before
[06:16] <Firefishe> Will apt-get'ing kubuntu-desktop on a straight ubuntu/gnome machine install what I need for full kde/gnome functionality?
[06:16] <dabaR> Fall2Hell: it is the old installation way, more similar to the windows install process. The desktop CD boots ubuntu, and has an install icon that runs the install program like all other programs such as firefox. The alternate CD boots into the installer program.
[06:17] <dabaR> Firefishe: yes.
[06:17] <sethk> Pelo, there is a page in the settings dialog that lets you specify the colors used for different types of text.  that also, obviously,tells you what the current colors are mapped to
[06:17] <Epidemik> IT WORKED!!!

[06:18] <Firefishe> thanks, dabaR, all 477mb of it! ;) hee  Just wanted some input, I thought that was it.

[06:18] <dabaR> dabaR: You mean how come I know so much about Ubuntu? I have been on this channel when it had about 50 users or something.
[06:18] <matroblend> The ATI Radeon open-source driver HowTo has anyone done this????
[06:18] <Epidemik> How do i change my password?
[06:18] <Epidemik> !password
[06:18] <ubotu> Forgot your password? Boot into recovery mode. What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[06:19] <amy> 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales' doesnt work work after edgy install... need to add an optional locale. how?
[06:19] <dabaR> Epidemik: the command is passwd
[06:19] <Pelo> onion,  you'll have to do better then that, we' can'T tell either
[06:19] <Epidemik> dabaR so i do passwd <newpasswordhere> ?
[06:19] <Epidemik> in console
[06:19] <dabaR> amy: and you installed it?

[06:19] <sethk> Epidemik, no, passwd username        as root, or as an ordinary user, just passwd
[06:19] <Pelo> onion,  search for that in the ubuntu forum
[06:20] <Firefishe> onion, you may want to post to a paste service
[06:20] <dabaR> matroblend: what are you asking exactly?
[06:20] <Firefishe> www.rafb.net
[06:20] <Firefishe> did i get that right?
[06:20] <dabaR> maybe, but it is an installer error, so he likely can not paste.
[06:20] <onion> ty
[06:20] <amy> dabaR, no. trying to install but there is no success
[06:20] <matroblend> dabaR: I just did it and I get a error
[06:20] <dabaR> or with ubiquity, maybe he can
[06:21] <dabaR> amy: do you get some errors? show us on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:21] <Epidemik> thank you all

[06:23] <dabaR> k
[06:23] <matroblend> It is for the radeon vid card
[06:23] <kishan> Pelo, i get a smilar error of matroblend when i start beryl what does it actually indicate
[06:23] <ryan__> I have edgy installed, but beryl keeps complaining that I don't have Glibc2.4, anyone know whats going on?
[06:24] <dabaR> matroblend: show me output of lspci on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:24] <VigoFusion> matroblend: Thank you, that has been updated
[06:24] <Pelo> kishan,  I get a similar error when running winecfg and playing around with the themes, I have no idea what it means
[06:24] <Epidemik> is there anyway so i can have a user have no password
[06:24] <VigoFusion> :)
[06:24] <dabaR> ryan__: aptitude search glib |grep ^i and see whether that gives you any output.
[06:24] <amy> dabaR, no. no errors... many variations of the current locale 'en' were 'Generated' and returned to shell prompt with the message 'Generation complete' ... do i need to run dpkg with special options for errors?
[06:25] <matroblend>  paste.ubuntu-nl.org ??? DOn't understand
[06:25] <arepie> does anybody experience, problem with aiglx?? yesterday.. my graphic card able to direct randering.. and today.. after restart.. the direct randering was gone.. i didn't changed anything in xorg.conf
[06:25] <Pelo> dabaR, I'm just here to learn
[06:25] <dabaR> matroblend: open it in a browser, run lspci in a terminal, post output from the command to the pastebin site, and give us a link.
[06:25] <ryan__> dabaR: and what should I be looking for
[06:25] <dabaR> Pelo: right, I know, and it is fun to watch.
[06:26] <dabaR> ryan__: have output? show me, please.
[06:26] <matroblend> Hmm k
[06:26] <dabaR> Epidemik: ya, probably, why are you asking, what exactly do you want to use that for?
[06:27] <dabaR> arepie: there is a #ubuntu-xgl, they may know.
[06:27] <ryan__> dabaR: it was 5 lines so I pasted it to you
[06:27] <dabaR> ryan__: you are not registered on freenode, so the server discarded it.

[06:31] <Heiroglyphics> how do i use the useradd command?
[06:31] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: you can try the manual, run man useradd in a terminal
[06:32] <Heiroglyphics> i did that
[06:32] <dabaR> ryan__: did you ask in #ubuntu-xgl? They likely know more.
[06:32] <ryan__> I'll try

[06:34] <Heiroglyphics> well I'm just not sure how to set it up

[06:35] <matroblend> ok
[06:35] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: it is a program that adds users, there is no set up in a strict set up definition. Are you trying to add a user?
[06:35] <Heiroglyphics> no not exactly im just trying to get around the problem I made
[06:36] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: explain more.
[06:36] <kishan> dabaR: help please http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33841/

[06:39] <redDEADresolve> thats what i thought, how do i make sure>
[06:39] <tonyyarusso> !wifi | thrillin`
[06:39] <ubotu> thrillin`: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:39] <matroblend> Do I add "direct rendering" as part of the command?
[06:39] <keeganX> Does anyone know a way to tweak Nicotine+, so it doesn't run so slow?
[06:39] <dabaR> thrillin`: no, if you use airport extreme

[06:39] <thrillin`> i have wireless
[06:40] <dabaR> matroblend: yes, it is part of it.

[06:44] <sn9> thrillin`: built-in?
[06:44] <solo> sn9: just quick where do u put the driver file for fwcutter to read it
[06:44] <solo> it wont take a dir
[06:44] <sizzam> i have a folder called 'pictures' in my home folder.   what's the best way to share that folder with read/write access to multiple user accounts on this same machine?
[06:44] <thrillin`> Airport
[06:44] <thrillin`> built in
[06:45] <asfalt> hello, am i able to use network-manager-gnome in edgy with WPA wireless connections? the Network Monitor app seems to have no provision. In meantime I edited a wpa_supplicant.conf and /etc/network/interfaces run wpa_supplicant and all works, however it is a major pain to change networks, ie requires edits of two files manually and creating the passphrase and in case of switching to another wpa, wep or open network. there has to be a better way?
[06:45] <sn9> solo: i don't remember offhand, but there's a broadcom wifi howto on the forum
[06:45] <thrillin`> i feel i'll test on my home pc first b4 i try on my mac

[06:45] <thrillin`> doh wanna mess up my baby
[06:45] <sn9> thrillin`: airport classic or airport extreme?
[06:45] <dabaR> kishan: do you also use the free radeon driver, ati, or the fglrx proprietary one?

[06:46] <paitart> hi! i just upgraded to 6.10. how come there is no "turn off", "sign out" button in the desktop? how do i turn it off safely?
[06:46] <kishan> dabaR: i have intel video card
[06:46] <sn9> thrillin`: classic will work just fine from cd, but won't do wpa
[06:46] <amy> how do you add a locale ... eg 'sp' an option to exsting language support in edgy?
[06:46] <asfalt> paitart the red button in upper right hand side corner, do you have that?
[06:46] <thrillin`> yea my cousin have wpa
[06:46] <OctobersDark> er.. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.o
[06:46] <dabaR> paitart: it is not in the top right?
[06:46] <sn9> thrillin`: but wep works
[06:46] <matroblend> dabaR did you see my last paste
[06:46] <OctobersDark> should be http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[06:47] <asfalt> thrillin` to setup wpa i had to manually edit two files, it's not convienient
[06:47] <dabaR> matroblend: it seems it is a bug with the fre driver, according to this https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-driver-ati/+bug/58541, can you read a little and see whether it applies to your issue?
[06:47] <paitart> asfalt, i used to have that in 6.06. it got replaced by a black door. in the places menu, the quit menu brings me a window without any "turn off" option
[06:47] <asfalt> which is what i am trying to find out, if there is a gnome applet which will let me manage wpa and wep connections in gnome in edgy
[06:47] <thrillin`> hmm
[06:47] <paitart> dabar, i used to have that in 6.06. it got replaced by a black door. in the places menu, the quit menu brings me a window without any "turn off" option
[06:48] <thrillin`> have a doc on that @ asfalt
[06:48] <matroblend> dabaR: ok
[06:48] <asfalt> paitart what about from the System menu
[06:48] <dabaR> paitart: a black door? what happens when you click on the door?
[06:48] <asfalt> he changed theme from default hence the door
[06:49] <dabaR> asfalt: still it should work the same way...
[06:49] <IcemanV9> !network-manager | asfalt
[06:49] <ubotu> asfalt: networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[06:49] <jvolkman> sizzam, I believe you can set the sgid bit on your pictures directory to get each new file created in that directory to be under the same group
[06:49] <rainbow> hello
[06:49] <sn9> thrillin`: wpa support for classic airport will happen eventually, but it just isn't ready yet. if you have a machine with airport classic, you will need a non-apple adapter to use wpa
[06:49] <paitart> asfalt and dabar: a window comes out. the only choices when i click that black door are: logout, lockscreen, switch user, suspend, hibernate. no choice for "turn off" or "shut down"
[06:49] <VigoFusion> Is mydogsname a good password?
[06:49] <sizzam> thanks jvolkman
[06:49] <kishan> dabaR: can u help me i am using intel  video card and edgy
[06:49] <Jordan_U> asfalt: But having network-manager will not magically make wpa work, you will still need to set that up.
[06:49] <thrillin`> i not buying no seperate adapter and my laptop have a built-in
[06:50] <thrillin`> unless someone buys me one :)
[06:50] <kishan> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33841/
[06:50] <asfalt> IcemanV9 i just installed network-manager-gnome but it seems to give me no option to configure any of my interfaces. could it be because i manually edited my /etc/network/interfaces for one adapted for wpa_supplicant?
[06:50] <sn9> thrillin`: so you have a powerbook, not an ibook, right?
[06:50] <rainbow> can I remove general multi-lingual speech synthesis system from startup services?
[06:50] <lotia> anyone from london on?
[06:50] <thrillin`> yea powerbook
[06:50] <kishan> dabaR:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33844/
[06:50] <sn9> thrillin`: what speed?
[06:50] <lotia> if so, any recommendations on where i can get a netgear wireless access point (not router) in the city?
[06:51] <kishan> dabaR:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33846/ my xorg.conf
[06:51] <thrillin`> 1.67ghz 1gb ddr2 ram
[06:51] <IcemanV9> asfalt: network-manager always ask for wpa password and that's it.
[06:51] <Pelo> rainbow,  system > prefs > sessions,  third tab,  I think
[06:51] <asfalt> IcemanV9 it sits in notification area with "no connection" when i right click i jus thave an option to enable networking (it is ticked) and "connection information" greyed out and About
[06:51] <paitart> asfalt and dabar: a window comes out. the only choices when i click that black door are: logout, lockscreen, switch user, suspend, hibernate. no choice for "turn off" or "shut down"
[06:51] <thrillin`> i wanna get a mac book pro though...gonna sell my wifey here
[06:51] <kishan> dabaR: can u help me
[06:51] <sn9> thrillin`: sorry, but that had airport extreme, not airport classic
[06:51] <asfalt> IcemanV9 but as i mentioned i configured wpa_supplicant manually throught the interfaces file, if i remove that network-manager-gnome will work?
[06:51] <thrillin`> seriously...damn it
[06:51] <dabaR> kishan: no, not really, I know nothing of these video card issues, really never played with it(except for a moment ago, and you saw how my X crashed...)
[06:52] <mborohov> so apparently ive been on my neighbor's wireless for the past two days and have had no idea haha
[06:52] <sn9> thrillin`: that means you can use wpa just fine, but will have no wifi at all when running from cd
[06:52] <Jordan_U> asfalt: Did you comment out your wireles interface in /etc/network/interfaces?
[06:52] <rainbow> Pelo: can I remove it safely?
[06:52] <thrillin`> oh yea u right
[06:52] <mborohov> i knew it wasnt mine when i went to go forward a port, and the admin password was 'password'
[06:52] <mborohov> :p
[06:52] <d3cod3> k question, i downloaded the jre java update, how do i install it?
[06:52] <thrillin`> i now see...my bad
[06:52] <asfalt> Jordan_U no, at the moment it is in there with pre-up wpa supplicant command
[06:52] <dabaR> paitart: and you know there is a shut down at the login screen, right?
[06:52] <thrillin`> how to install on mac?
[06:52] <IcemanV9> asfalt: you can remove network-manager (and install it back) and see if it does work (never done it before)
[06:52] <Pelo> rainbow,   see where I pointed you to see if you can uncheck it first ,  Idon'T think I have that running myself so it's probaly not an issue
[06:52] <thrillin`> and how do i remove it?
[06:53] <sn9> thrillin`: the wifi specifically, or ubuntu in general?
[06:53] <paitart> dabar, i will check again
[06:53] <Jordan_U> thrillin`: Just download the liveCD and hold the "C" key at boot.
[06:53] <Pelo> kishan,  what is your problem again ?
[06:53] <thrillin`> ubuntu in general
[06:53] <rainbow> Pelo: i use bum to check services
[06:53] <rainbow> !bum
[06:53] <ubotu> Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions - To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d - To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local - See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto
[06:53] <thrillin`> i already did that @ jordan
[06:53] <sn9> thrillin`: depends on whether you want to get rid of the osx you have on there or not
[06:53] <rainbow> !bum > Pelo
[06:54] <Pelo> rainbow,   do you own research
[06:54] <rainbow> Pelo: go away troll
[06:54] <thrillin`> nahh...i wanna keep osx
[06:54] <rainbow> Pelo: leave me alone, stop trolling
[06:54] <Jordan_U> asfalt: I needed to comment out my wireless interface for wireless to work, I don't know if network-manager will deal with wpa_supplicant though.
[06:54] <mborohov> how can i switch wireless networks?
[06:54] <asfalt> Jordan_U aha, trying that now
[06:54] <sn9> thrillin`: if you have an osx partition taking up the whole hard disk, you will need to shrink it
[06:54] <thrillin`> i have all my design work here...i want to use my gfx programs i accustomed to
[06:55] <thrillin`> how i shrink it
[06:55] <matroblend> dadbR: It seems to be a mesa issue, but not sure what to do if anything. I tried the fglrx to my misery pain and sorrow.
[06:55] <Firefishe> My touchpad on my g4 powerpc alum. 15" 1ghz powerbook laptop won't recognize finger taps.  I've reconfigured xorg.conf three times.  The current incarnation is pasted here: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/0XgyR632.html
[06:55] <sn9> thrillin`: first, you need to turn off filesystem journaling from the OSX Terminal.app
[06:55] <dabaR> matroblend: me either. wait for someone to be available on #ubuntu-xgl.
[06:57] <matroblend> dabaR: Post the error on xgl?
[06:57] <asfalt> Jordan_U do you use Network Monitor as well or network manager alone?
[06:57] <Jordan_U> thrillin`: run this command in OS x : sudo diskutil enableJournal Macintosh\ HD/ && sudo diskutil disableJournal Macintosh\ HD/
[06:58] <dabaR> matroblend: ya, ask about your error on that channel, and wait for someone to be able to help, sorry, that is the only thing I can recommend.
[06:58] <mnguyen> hey is there anything special about memory sold as dual channel?
[06:58] <thrillin`> brb
[06:58] <sn9> Jordan_U: that's not quite right. you need a /dev node
[06:58] <thrillin`> gonna run gears of war
[06:58] <thrillin`> thx
[06:59] <Jordan_U> asfalt: I use network-manager-gnome which is a gnome panel applet.
[06:59] <matroblend> dabaR: thankyou at least you are trying and I am farther than before
[06:59] <mnguyen> like... dual channel memory is just two sticks of normal memory right? they don't particularly work together any better do they
[06:59] <asfalt> jordan i see, because i already seem to have Network Monitor, another gnome panel applet which was there previously
=== d3cod3 is now known as fr0sty
=== fr0sty is now known as fr0styX
[06:59] <asfalt> so in turn now i have both in the panel
[06:59] <asfalt> but the network manager is not allowing me to manage anything heh
[07:00] <thrillin`> thx again ppls
[07:00] <IcemanV9> asfalt: i have both network monitor & network-manager working on the panel; no problem whatsoever since the installation
[07:00] <Jordan_U> sn9: Not with diskutil you don't, the volume name works just fine.
[07:01] <dabaR> matroblend: welcome
[07:01] <sn9> Jordan_U: not as a partial pathname. "/" would work best then
[07:01] <dibblego> what's the application that allows me to create a flash animation of my desktop?
[07:01] <asfalt> jordan heh, it started to work when i plugged in my wired network, then double clicking the icon showed me more options then previously!
[07:02] <VigoFusion> Ut Oh, just fired theold dell up and it works now=-O
[07:02] <corevette> i have a screen resolution problem, and its not the typical one
[07:02] <Jordan_U> sn9: sorry, I meant to put the /Volumes/ , but still, / would be much easier than that, I did it from a liveCD last I did it so it wasn't / :)
[07:02] <dabaR> Firefishe: well, they have this guide, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=270988, but somehow I am sceptical, seems overly simple. At least it will not take a lot of time to try
[07:03] <Firefishe> dabaR:  gotcha, I'll heed all caveats
[07:03] <Firefishe> can't hurt to try anyway :)
[07:03] <Firefishe> thanks
[07:03] <dabaR> welcome
[07:03] <Firefishe> :) happy turkey day
[07:04] <VigoFusion> dabaR: Good call, I had forgotten that one
[07:04] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: OK, I'm back and this is what it says, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33853/
[07:04] <dabaR> hehe, google helps with memory.
[07:04] <fr0styX> ey i got a problem, i downloaded the jre newest version to run Frostwire, its on my desktop as a bin file how do i install it so i can use it to open frostwire
[07:04] <Madpilot> !java | fr0styX
[07:04] <Epidemik> how can i astablish an SSH connection with a server?
[07:04] <ubotu> fr0styX: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[07:05] <dabaR> fr0styX: there is an ubuntu package of the newest jre
[07:05] <Epidemik> !SSH
[07:05] <ubotu> ssh is the Secure SHell protocol (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto). Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows, which can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[07:05] <ineedehelp> I need help actually getting the lde enviroment installed on ubuntu
[07:05] <corevette> what are symptoms of linux not detecting your graphics card?
[07:06] <Heiroglyphics> Epidemik, are you owner of phuzion.com?
[07:06] <Jordan_U> corevette: X won't work, that hardly ever happens though, your computer probably just doesn't have 3D acceleration.
[07:06] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: that seems like a totally different issue from what you had started with. It is always best to show symptoms when asking for help without a hint to the solution. Anyhow, show me what ls -l ~/.dmrc tells you.
[07:07] <Heiroglyphics> ok hold on I got to restart real quick
[07:07] <dabaR> corevette: x not starting often
[07:07] <corevette> Jordan_u i think that happened to me, its really laggy when i move windows around, and i can't achieve a rez greater than 800x600
[07:07] <Jordan_U> !fglrx | corevette
[07:07] <ubotu> corevette: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:07] <DARKGuy> almost any card can run even VESA mode though o_O... I remember I used to play 640x480 games with an OAK 1Mb card xD
[07:07] <dabaR> !fixres > corevette
[07:07] <corevette> jordan_u my graphics card is internal
[07:07] <Epidemik> Heiroglyphics: no ive never heard of that site...why?
[07:08] <dabaR> DARKGuy: heh
[07:08] <Firefishe> dabar:  that device line on that forum post is so short...your skepticism is warranted ;)
[07:08] <Jordan_U> corevette: intel?
[07:08] <corevette> dabar my resolution is not the typical fix, if i change it to 1024x798 it goes in a loop at the logon menu
[07:08] <Pelo> corevette,  did you try and edit your xorg.conf file ? and did you change the vertrefresh and horiz sync on top of adding the desired resolutions ?
[07:08] <Epidemik> how can i astablish an SSH connection with a server?
[07:08] <corevette> jordan no
[07:08] <Firefishe> dabar:  it didn't work the first time I tried it, either ;) hee
[07:08] <corevette> pelo yes
[07:08] <dabaR> ineedehelp: kde ?
[07:08] <Firefishe> i wonder if I'm mising some ctrl-alt combination to enable tapping or something
[07:09] <Jordan_U> corevette: What kind of card is it?
[07:09] <ineedehelp> yeah, kde...sry
[07:09] <corevette> jordan_u, nvidia geforce 4 it came with computer on the motherboard
[07:09] <dabaR> !kde > ineedehelp
[07:09] <jwise> hello,boys, i'v got some problem with my acpi re-installation.
=== rainbow is now known as lifepostive
[07:09] <jwise> any helps?
[07:10] <ineedehelp> well, I get an error everytime I try running that
[07:10] <Jordan_U> corevette: Look at the link ubotu gave you earlier then for installing nvidia drivers.
[07:10] <dabaR> ineedehelp: what error, running what?
[07:10] <ineedehelp> lemme pull it up again
[07:10] <dabaR> Epidemik: in a terminal, run ssh user@host
[07:11] <solo> whats the command to see ur kernal version
[07:11] <Firefishe> uname -r
[07:11] <Jordan_U> solo: uname -a
[07:11] <solo> ty
[07:11] <Snadge> has anyone got any info on how to install ubuntu via network or from another hard drive? (edgy)
[07:11] <Firefishe> -a gives you all output, -r will give you just the kernel version
[07:11] <Jordan_U> !install | Snadge
[07:11] <ubotu> Snadge: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[07:12] <Epidemik> dabaR: thanks, i tried that though, it said connection refused
[07:12] <Epidemik> dabaR: the connection requires a password, when would i put that in?
[07:12] <dabaR> Snadge: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[07:12] <Twinxor> I don't think the bug reporter tool is too smart - it automatically opened a bug report on gnome.org
[07:12] <Twinxor> not so great
[07:13] <dabaR> Epidemik: try reading the manual, run man ssh
[07:13] <Epidemik> oo thats a lot to read lol
[07:13] <Epidemik> dabar: thanks
[07:13] <Epidemik> ill be back ;)
[07:14] <ineedehelp> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33857/
[07:14] <dabaR> Epidemik: actually, it says nothing about it. You should get asked for the password when you try connecting, connection refused usually means no ssh server on host, or ssh running without interactive authentication, such as with a key or something.
[07:14] <jwise> /proc/acpi/event anyone tell me the content about this file,thanks.
[07:15] <Epidemik> dabaR: im a noob, what does that mean? I cant connect to it because its not enabled?
[07:15] <jwise> It always show:"acpid: can't open /proc/acpi/event: Device or resource busy
[07:15] <jwise> "
[07:15] <dabaR> something like that, yes. COntact the person whose computer you are connecting to, and ask how to connect exactly.
[07:16] <dabaR> jwise: did you try passing noacpi as the boot option? I heard of that somewhere, google for that.
[07:17] <dabaR> ineedehelp: post your /etc/apt/sources.list file to pastebin, and run sudo aptitude -f install;sudo aptitude install -f; sudo apt-get install -f and post output of that as well to pastebin.
[07:17] <jwise> I've googled so many times, it doesn't solve problem.It seems I've stopped the acpi service once,than it got the problem after I restart it.
[07:17] <Epidemik> dabaR: is there a progam (other than terminal) that can do this?
[07:18] <dabaR> ssh? no, ssh is a terminal program. You can connect to transfer files over the ssh protocol with nautilus, with the places menu, the connect to server applet
[07:18] <sn9> Epidemik: why would you need a special program when any ol' terminal will do?
[07:18] <bokey> hi all. =)
[07:19] <allen> anyone here can help me?
=== allen is now known as allen2003

[07:23] <nachaLibre> the path is wrong
[07:23] <allen2003> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[07:23] <allen2003> wooops
[07:23] <bokey> dabaR, =) gtkpod.. no. it's a single python file
[07:23] <bokey> dabaR, forgot it's name.
[07:23] <DARKGuy> Hm, I wonder, is there a program which can limit my computer's bandwidth so I don't take it all and my brother can use some Kbs too? (like NetLimiter for Windoze)
[07:23] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR, what was it you needed to see again?
[07:24] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: show me what ls -l ~/.dmrc tells you.
[07:25] <allen2003> the file format is invalid dabaR >_>
[07:25] <allen2003> i always get that when i install it
[07:25] <Epidemik> sn9 the server is a game server
[07:25] <Heiroglyphics> debaR:i do cvn ls -l ~/.dmrc ?
[07:25] <dabaR> bokey: search for ipod directory python on google, or click http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=ipod+directory+python&btnG=Google+Search&meta= is best I can think of
[07:26] <nayru> Hello, im having trouble with the Terminal (alt+ctrl+F1) when i press it my screen displays random junk colors weird patterns and such...
[07:26] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: ls -l ~/.dmrc
[07:26] <Epidemik> sn9 so its my server but its not sitting infront of me. its off in New York somewhere. And i need a program cause good ol terminal wont connect
[07:26] <sn9> Epidemik: a game server that uses ssh? that really doesn't sound right
[07:26] <Epidemik> ummm
[07:26] <Epidemik> lol i hate being a noob
[07:26] <Epidemik> sn9 it claims to use SSH to allow me (the client) to start and stop the server

[07:27] <Tido> anyone know a good way to manage wireless connections in edgy?

[07:27] <ubotu> Tido: networkmanager is an application to make (wireless) networking Just Work. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[07:28] <Epidemik> sn9 what do they mean?
[07:28] <Epidemik> sn9 i pm'ed you the knowledge base article
[07:28] <DARKGuy> nayru, does it do that too when you boot in recovery mode?
[07:29] <dabaR> ineedehelp: remove the # from the second line in the sources.list file, then run sudo aptitude update, then run sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop, tell me whether you get the same error.
[07:29] <Firefishe> I just updated my xorg.conf file.  Is there a way to apply the settings to the xserver in real time without having to restart it?
[07:30] <dabaR> ineedehelp: line 5 in that post on pastebin...
[07:30] <DARKGuy> I don't think so Firefishe :(
[07:30] <dabaR> Firefishe: no
[07:30] <Firefishe> oh goody ;) hee
[07:30] <Jordan_U> Firefishe: But you don't need to reboot either, just restart X.
[07:31] <dabaR> keep your text buffers in the console when troubleshooting X, then.
[07:31] <ineedehelp> but sources.list is read only
[07:31] <Firefishe> Jordan_U: uh huh...*sigh*  Well, if I write *that* code ;)
[07:31] <dabaR> ineedehelp: are you using gedit to edit it?
[07:31] <Jordan_U> !sudo | ineedehelp
[07:31] <ubotu> ineedehelp: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:32] <ineedehelp> I hate being a n00b
[07:32] <ineedehelp> sry
[07:32] <Jordan_U> ineedehelp: It is read only because your user does not have write privaleges.
[07:32] <ineedehelp> Ok, I get it now....thanks. ^_^
[07:32] <dabaR> Jordan_U: I heard people recommending gksudo with graphical apps instead of just sudo.
[07:33] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: This is what it says after but its not the dmrc i don't think  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33862/
[07:33] <Jordan_U> dabaR: Yes, I have head that it is bad to run GUI apps with sudo , don't know why though.
[07:33] <Jordan_U> *heard
[07:34] <mordof> dabaR, Jordan_U, maybe it doesn't clean up some of the graphical library includes needed or something... but gksudo would
[07:34] <morten_> is the narnia movie any close to as good as the old miniseries from the 80s?
[07:34] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: is that output of ls -l ~/.dmrc?
[07:34] <bokey> dabaR, thanks heaps. man.. it's the rebuild_db.py =)
[07:34] <morten_> serios question
[07:34] <morten_> help me out here, nerds!
[07:34] <mordof> morten_, i never saw that but i've read all the books and i thought the movie was pretty good
[07:34] <DARKGuy> morten_, I have no idea, but I loved the Narnia movie :P
[07:34] <dabaR> bokey: did you find it on google?
[07:35] <bokey> dabaR, yeah it's the http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=ipod+directory+python&btnG=Google+Search&meta=

[07:35] <mordof> morten_, it jumpled a few unimportant things to make the movie work... but aside from that most of it followed everything as it should
[07:35] <tengo> life or death question
=== kishan is now known as ki
[07:35] <aidanr> the tv series was rubbish, the books rocked, the movie is somewhere in between
=== ki is now known as kid
[07:35] <morten_> maybe i should give it a go. i've heard the miniseries is kinda looked down on since it was low budget, but i've seen that every easter since i can remember, so the new movie will have to work hard at it
[07:35] <morten_> i'll give it a go
[07:35] <kid> jo
[07:35] <tengo> when i try to install linux restricted modules, it says nvidia kernel common is not installable\
[07:35] <dabaR> aidanr: hehe, are you brittish?
[07:35] <aidanr> irish
[07:36] <dabaR> aidanr: I knew you were not american cause you said rubbish
[07:36] <morten_> dabaR: i'm norwegian, actually. but the state channel shows the lion, witch and the wardrobe in the mornings during easter
[07:36] <Heiroglyphics> dabar: no but it comes right after the "Users $HOMe/.dmrc file is being ignored..."
[07:36] <dabaR> well, I guess your name is also cool too.
[07:36] <aidanr> yeah ok, the whole rubbish/trash thingimabob
[07:36] <morten_> makes me feel like a little kid again
[07:36] <sn9> Jordan_U: because it spews garbage to the terminal, which leads one to close the terminal, thereby also closing the app
[07:37] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: are you in Ubuntu now?
[07:37] <tengo> anyone? when i try to install linux restricted modules, it says nvidia kernel common is not installable....
[07:37] <morten_> install nvidia-kernel-common first
[07:37] <ineedehelp> dabaR and Jordan_U: Thank you very much. It is installing now. ^_^
[07:37] <morten_> or force the install
[07:37] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: no i can only get on the rescue terminal
[07:37] <dabaR> ineedehelp: welcome.
[07:37] <Jordan_U> sn9: Is that really it, lol I thought is was a technical problem not a pebkac preventer :)
[07:37] <tengo> morten_ i cant access the internet, and its not on the cd
[07:38] <morten_> tengo: it probably has multiple layers of dependencies, which causes that
[07:38] <morten_> tengo: i guess you're fucked, then
[07:38] <DARKGuy> Wait, wtf?
[07:38] <tengo> morten_ thanks
[07:38] <morten_> np
[07:38] <DARKGuy> he can't access internet and he's here? oO
[07:38] <morten_> hmm
[07:38] <sn9> Jordan_U: there is also the tendency of GUIs to do very gag-inducing things when they get root access in general
[07:38] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: well, I am pretty sure we could fix it, but I need more info about what you exactly did, and what gives you that error.
[07:38] <tengo> darkguy,  i'm on a windows laptop
[07:38] <morten_> good catch, DARKGuy
[07:38] <morten_> why can't your linux box access the nets?
[07:38] <DARKGuy> tengo, ah, that makes sense now o.o;
[07:39] <DARKGuy> lol, thanks morten_ =P
[07:39] <tengo> morten_ i tried to install nvidia, but it disable my internet somehow
[07:39] <morten_> ...
[07:39] <arun_> I want to mount two ntfs drives using /dev/hda1 /media/windows ntfs umask=0222 0 0
[07:39] <arun_> can I append two lines one after another?
[07:39] <sn9> !ntfs-3g | arun_
[07:39] <ubotu> arun_: ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[07:40] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: Begining prompt when I log in
=== arun_ is now known as ragamuffin
[07:40] <dabaR> arun_: first of all, the device node must be different for each if you intend to mount 2 drives. Second, you can not mount two devices on same mount point, other than that, it looks great.
[07:40] <tengo> so this is my last post BEFORE I REINSTALL UBUNTU: when i try to install linux restricted modules, it says nvidia kernel common is not installable...and i don't have access to the internet through hat ocmputer
[07:41] <atrus> i have a DVD of a family vacation I need to duplicate. I have a dvd-rom and a dvd-rw and some blanks. what's the easy way to do this?
[07:41] <sn9> atrus: yes
[07:41] <sn9> atrus: which cpu do you have?
[07:41] <ineedehelp> so if I install ntfs-3g, I can access my windows partitions? or did I read that KDE can do that for me?
[07:41] <dabaR> tengo: it could be many things, even a simple enabled repositories issue, do you remember more of the error? can you use irssi and come back here while in Ubuntu?
[07:41] <sn9> atrus: oops, not you
[07:41] <sn9> tengo: yes, which cpu do you have?
[07:42] <dabaR> ineedehelp: ntfs-3g is for writing to the iwndows partition.
[07:42] <bokey> ragamuffin, mount -ro -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/windows
[07:42] <tengo> sn9 which computer model or what
[07:42] <dabaR> !mountwindows
[07:42] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:42] <tengo> ebar, irssi?
[07:42] <dabaR> ragamuffin: I hope you saw that post from me...
[07:42] <sn9> tengo: pentium, celeron, athlon, duron, sempron, turion...
[07:42] <ineedehelp> look at the bright side....the more you teach me, the more I can teach others ^_^
[07:43] <dabaR> tengo: ya, a text only irc client, that way you could speak with us from ubuntu, and we could look into the issue, but you said internet does not even work in your ubuntu installation, so not sure.
[07:43] <tengo> tengo athlon
[07:43] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: How do I view -l ~/.dmrc ?
[07:43] <tengo> debar yeah internet doesn't work period without madwifi
[07:43] <tengo> debar which is in the restricted driver that requires nvidia
[07:43] <sn9> tengo: athlon? ok. did you install the 32-bit ubuntu or the 64-bit?
[07:44] <tengo> sn9 32
[07:44] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: what is your ubuntu user name for the normal user?
[07:45] <DrakeMastil> are there any free game emulators? i dont have a way to pay for cedega atm
[07:45] <sn9> tengo: ok. can you temporarily connect that machine to the 'net by ethernet?
[07:45] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: yg
[07:45] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: just yg?
[07:45] <tengo> sn9 nope
[07:45] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: yeah
[07:45] <snoop> how can I install automatix?
[07:45] <ineedehelp> DrakeMastil: For what console?
[07:45] <snoop> or where can I donwload it
[07:45] <sn9> tengo: and you can't get madwifi to work?
[07:46] <DrakeMastil> ineedhelp: Windows based games
[07:46] <tengo> sn9 well i have it on the computer
[07:46] <tengo> sn9 but when i type in make, it says missing heading for KERNELPATH
[07:46] <sn9> tengo: no, no. madwifi is preinstalled on ubuntu
[07:47] <ragamuffin> dabaR: how can i change the device node for mounting a second partition?
[07:47] <snoop> where can I download automatix?
[07:47] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: try this. boot into the recovery mode, and run chown -R yg:yg /home/yg;chmod 600 /home/yg/.dmrc, then reboot, and try logging in as yg, then come back here and tell me how it worked.
[07:47] <dabaR> snoop: ask google, really.
[07:47] <sn9> !automatix | snoop
[07:47] <ubotu> snoop: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[07:47] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: ok
[07:47] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: see ya
[07:48] <tengo> sn9 how do i see if its installed
[07:48] <dabaR> ragamuffin: well, run sudo fdisk -l and post output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:48] <m0zone> i searched before comein in here lol  is there a way to set open term right click on folder to save on typeing :P
[07:48] <sn9> tengo: if you installed ubuntu off the cd, it's installed
[07:48] <DrakeMastil> ineedhelp: Windows based games
[07:48] <ragamuffin> dabaR: I will post the result on pastebin
[07:49] <DrakeMastil> Cedega is all i know... are there others? preferably free
[07:49] <tengo> sn9 ok...if you say so
[07:49] <dabaR> m0zone: I do not understand your sentence at all.
[07:49] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, WINE is one, but it needs some tweaking for a few games
[07:49] <tengo> sn9, this whole problem started when i tried to install an nvidia driver, so when i restarted it my internet didn't work
[07:49] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, there are also Loki installers for Windows games that you already have
[07:49] <sn9> tengo: that actually makes sense
[07:49] <m0zone> okies insted of typeing cd /home/m0zone/gamefolder/  in term i just open natiuls  and right click on game folder open in term  or open terminal here
[07:50] <tengo> sn9 how come?
[07:50] <m0zone> i got use to it in kde
[07:50] <DrakeMastil> DARKGuy: Tweaking as in? I'm an power-user, in terms, on windows but still newer to linux
[07:50] <dabaR> morten_: Oh, I do not know of that.
[07:50] <sn9> tengo: both the nvidia kernel modules and madwifi are part of linux-restricted-modules
[07:51] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, same here ;) some games (like World of Warcraft, for example) need specifical patches needed to be inserted in a WINE source package and recompile WINE entirely, so WoW works
[07:51] <tengo> sn9 fuck, then why'd someone tell me to install the nvidia ones?
[07:51] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, other games may just work without any problems (Like Diablo II) and others might need some WINE config tweaking, rather than in Cedega just installing and running :P
[07:51] <DrakeMastil> DARKGuy: How about Lineage 2?
[07:51] <dabaR> m0zone: oooh, ooh, I know, install nautilus-open-terminal
[07:52] <m0zone> tnxs gonna try that
[07:52] <dabaR> m0zone: it works, I just tried.
[07:52] <tengo> sn9, so is there a way to revert?
[07:52] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, Hm, I've only played it in Windows, but I'm not really sure it'll work... not the game, but the anti hacking system itself (which is similar to the ones that GunBound, Silkroad and Mu use) might not let you run it... who knows, you could give it a go
[07:52] <renato> hello everyone
[07:52] <ragamuffin> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33865/
[07:53] <sn9> tengo: the nvidia stuff comes in two parts on ubuntu: kernel and X. the kernel stuff is preinstalled, but the X stuff is in the apt pkg "nvidia-glx" -- if you installed from nvidia.com, you're unlikely to recover without some other internet access
[07:53] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, Lineage 2 uses a modified Unreal Engine so for that I'm sure it works, but the antihacking system might be a problem since it uses Windows specific API for getting PC info, opened processes and such ^^;
[07:53] <dabaR> ragamuffin: do you know which of those partitions you are trying to mount? If not, tell me their drive letters from windows.
[07:54] <ragamuffin> dabaR: ok
[07:54] <tengo> sn9 i installed the packages with synaptic
[07:54] <renato> I am running kubuntu and want to run ubuntu instead. Is there a chance I can do this without reinstalling?
[07:54] <aidanr> someone pm me in 5 seconds please, testing something
[07:54] <DrakeMastil> DARKGuy: sounds good thus far... just need to learn the commands for BASH now xD
[07:54] <sn9> tengo: just the one called "nvidia-glx" right?
[07:54] <dabaR> renato: install ubuntu-desktop, and use sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop
[07:54] <renato> can I keep both?
[07:55] <dabaR> renato: yes
[07:55] <tengo> sn9 yeah
[07:55] <renato> oh, thank you dabaR
[07:55] <dabaR> DrakeMastil: there is a tutorial. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[07:55] <dabaR> renato: welcome
[07:55] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, those won't be a problem ^_^ try to handle yourself in the Linux environment and familiarize yourself with it, you're going to have to use the terminal a lot so a tutorial like dabaR just linked you might help :)
[07:55] <DrakeMastil> dabaR: thanks reading it right now
[07:56] <aidanr> someone, anyone, count 5 seconds, then pm me and say boo or something, please, trying to test something
[07:56] <disco_stu> Hi everybody
[07:56] <tengo> sn9 theres nothing to revert back to a previous time
[07:56] <sn9> tengo: ok, that by itself shouldn't have caused your problem then. however, you mentioned nvidia-kernel-common, which has to do with the kernel stuff
[07:56] <tengo> sn9 ?
[07:56] <m0zone> dabar any type of setup i need to do :P apt-got it  now digin to find it lol
[07:56] <DrakeMastil> DARKGuy: Any idea how to get WINE downloaded the links are not very let's say user friendly
[07:56] <tengo> sn9 hold on i think i got that too, and nvidia tools
[07:56] <ragamuffin> dabaR: when I click browsefor  partition 7 and 8 under Admin>Disk I get to the same drive, which I thind is /hda8
[07:57] <dabaR> m0zone: well, killall nautilus in a terminal will restart nautilus, and that will make it work
[07:57] <aidanr> dabaR, help me out? read up
[07:57] <ragamuffin> dabaR: I want hda7 mounted
[07:57] <disco_stu> I have a question about upgrading - I enter the "gksu" update and it says my root password is incorrect.  I went and chaged the root password and it still doesn't work
[07:57] <cj> anyone here familiar with aiglx?
[07:57] <cj> is it an X module?
[07:57] <DrakeMastil> ooo wait im not using i386... i'm on the 64bit platform... i need to compile the source
[07:57] <sn9> tengo: you should have installed only "nvidia-glx" (and if you cared, "linux-k7")
[07:58] <aidanr> thanks dabaR that got it
[07:58] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: it says invalid group, if you can, can you show me the list of group types like admin,root, etc
[07:58] <dabaR> disco_stu: gksu uses your password, not the root one
[07:58] <disco_stu> it doesn't work with that either
[07:58] <tengo> sn9, so is there a way to reverse the effects
[07:59] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: usually there will be a group with the same name as the user. weird. did you delete the user completely?
[07:59] <dabaR> disco_stu: what about sudo ls, does that accept your password?
[07:59] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, Hm, in the Wine page there's a HowTo for downloading it, you just have to add the repository to your sources.list and do apt-get update, then apt-get install wine :P
[07:59] <dabaR> !aiglx
[07:59] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[07:59] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: i didn't delete any users except the default one but I already made a user by then
[07:59] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, However if you're on 64-bit as you mentioned... yeah, gotta recompile from source, and I'm afraid I've never done that :(
[08:00] <sn9> tengo: since you've lost track of what exactly the effects even were, figuring out how to reverse them will take quite some doing. not impossible, though
[08:00] <tengo> so...recommend reinstalling?
[08:00] <DARKGuy> DrakeMastil, but the source can be obtained from the same repository if I recall correctly :P
[08:00] <tengo> sn9?
[08:00] <z9999> We are new to Linux and have got most of the system working properly, and as it was factory installed, once received and connected to the internet we continue to get notice that there are updates, very many, 172 to be exact, available. We are uncertain of the importance of applying any or all of them and are worried of the possibility that one or more may create more problems to be solved,...
[08:00] <z9999> Could someone with extensive knowledge of Ubuntu please advise me of how I should handle updates to installed SW.
[08:00] <z9999> ...while at the same time unsure if any of them may eliminate existing problems. Mostly, we wish to avoid any possibility of doing anything that will necessitate the re-installation of the system as a whole.
[08:00] <sn9> tengo: probably, yeah
[08:00] <dabaR> ragamuffin: well, then do this: sudo mkdir /media/hda7 /media/hda8, then gksudo gedit /etc/fstab and tell me when you open the file for editing.
[08:01] <cj> thanks, dabaR
[08:01] <sn9> z9999: which version of ubuntu do you have?
[08:01] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: so there is a yg user now you think?
=== yama_away is now known as yama
[08:01] <disco_stu> sudo recognizes my password
[08:02] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: yeah i shows up on the login and i click on it and then type in password
[08:02] <z9999> sn9: It's Dapper, or 6.06 LTS if that is a better definition.
[08:02] <tengo> sn9 brb
[08:02] <dabaR> disco_stu: then try gksudo instead of gksu
[08:02] <disco_stu> ok
[08:02] <ragamuffin> dabaR: yes, done, openned etc/fstab in geditor
[08:02] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: then run the same command I gave you for the recovery mode, just change the chown yg:yg... to chown yg, so remove the :yg
[08:03] <Heiroglyphics> k
[08:03] <Heiroglyphics> brb
[08:03] <sn9> z9999: if you originally installed dapper and never applied any updates, 172 sounds about right
[08:03] <disco_stu> ok - it pulls up my update screen
[08:04] <dabaR> ragamuffin: the line will be /dev/hda7 /media/hda7 ntfs umask=0222 0 0 fix the spacing, add same one but with 8s for the other partition if you want that one mounted too. save, close, and run sudo mount -a, they should appear in the places menu.
[08:04] <dabaR> disco_stu: OK, go on with what you were doing.
[08:04] <disco_stu> Sorry - Im a total noob - im running Breezy - how do I select to update to 6.10
[08:04] <dabaR> !upgrade
[08:04] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[08:04] <aidanr> dabaR, could you do that for me one more time please, sorry to bother you
[08:04] <dabaR> disco_stu: make sure you upgrade to 6.06 first, you have to go one by one
[08:05] <sn9> z9999: you should have been applying them all this time, but now that there are this many, just to be safe, i would recommend an alternate method of applying them all at once just this time
[08:05] <redDEADresolve> does anyone here know how to use ddrescue??
[08:05] <aidanr> cheers
[08:05] <z9999> sn9: About all we have installed using the Pkg Mgr is some additional SW, and docs updates, as well as some ALSA files as directed by help at #alsa trying to get our mic to work.
[08:05] <z9999> Oh, and some wireless related pkgs as that also does not work.
[08:05] <Dayz> hellp
[08:05] <Dayz> hello
[08:06] <dabaR> z9999: you should keep your system up to date with updates, and usually they will not break anything on stable systems such as 6.06, so update now, ask for help if needed.
[08:06] <Marlun> If when trying to install Ubuntu it doesn't find my network card, how do I find drivers for linux? I've always just searched for windows drivers.
[08:06] <elephantum> hi, I don't know where to so I'll stick here: I've bought new laptop (Vaio sz220) and installed ubuntu edgy, almost everything works fine, except some moments. 1. some buttons on my keyboard refer to incorrect keystrokes for example right alt is ISO_Level3_Shift, I'd like to change it but I can not guess where is this information stored.
[08:06] <DARKGuy> I'm gonna ask again xD before going to program in Mono - is there a program which can limit my bandwidth so it doesn't take all the bandwidth and leave some left for my brother's PC? (like NetLimiter for Windows?)
[08:06] <dabaR> !wireless
[08:06] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:06] <Dayz> I need some help. My Ubuntu was fine until when I was shutting it down last night it froze up so I had to hold my power button to shut it down. Today when I try getting into Ubuntu everything loads up fine but then I get a black screen, I have no idea whats going on and why this is happening. I'm guessing when I shut down using the power something messed up. When I go into recovery mode same thing happens. Im using Ubuntu Dapper. Can
[08:07] <sn9> z9999: installing outside the pkg mgr is where things can go really wrong. if you never did that, then what i was about to tell you would really be the thing to do
[08:08] <redDEADresolve> does anyone here know how to use ddrescue?? i need to rescue a disk but dont know/cant figue it out
[08:08] <sn9> z9999: assuming you have a dedicated internet connection, select Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal, and type: sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as ce_nduth
[08:08] <z9999> sn9: I don't believe we have installed anything outside the pkg mgr
[08:08] <dabaR> Dayz: did you aptitude search bandwidth?
[08:09] <Dayz> no clue how or what that is
[08:09] <sn9> z9999: let that command run overnight
[08:09] <dabaR> Dayz: sorry, not for you.
[08:09] <axisys_> where can i get help w/ linksys 54G?

[08:10] <z9999> sn9: It will take a long time? We are on a satellite up/down link which sometimes goes down for a few minutes. Could that cause a problem?
[08:10] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:Didn't say anything this time. and it didn't do anything
[08:10] <mordof> would it be possible to take the desktop and server iso's, and put them onto 1 dvd with a boot menu to run either one?
[08:10] <mordof> if so how difficult would it be
[08:10] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: and you tried logging in?
[08:11] <ragamuffin> dabaR: I think I have done it. Thanks foryour help.
[08:11] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: yeah
[08:11] <dabaR> ragamuffin: good work.
[08:11] <elephantum> Dayz, you have two ways: easy one - reinstall, hard - try to find corrupted packages and reinstall them.
[08:11] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: and still same exact error?
[08:11] <sn9> z9999: if the connection goes down during the download, you may need to type the command several times in a row, until it no longer does anything
[08:11] <ragamuffin> dabaR: :)

[08:13] <ellioTb> i just pasted the wrong code from a how-to on the forum
[08:13] <ellioTb> and it did a "sudo rm /bin/sh"
[08:13] <ellioTb> there a way to undo this?
[08:13] <imissu29> ?
[08:14] <dabaR> ellioTb: try sudo apt-get install --reinstall bash
[08:14] <CoRnJuLiOx> when i plug my USB flash drive in, where does it get mounted to?
[08:14] <sn9> z9999: after this is all done, be sure to always click the orange square in the top panel of the screen whenever it appears
[08:14] <dabaR> CoRnJuLiOx: /media/usb or so
[08:14] <ellioTb> CoRnJuLiOx, thanx
[08:15] <dabaR> imissu29: you did not present us with an issue to solve. Are you saying it lets you log in to the console, but you would like to use the gnome desktop environment?
[08:16] <ellioTb> CoRnJuLiOx, still giving me bad interpreter errors, doh!
[08:16] <dabaR> ellioTb: where is it giving you those errors?
[08:16] <DrakeMastil> ok when trying to compile WINE i get an error
[08:16] <ellioTb> dabaR, terminal
[08:16] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, why compile it?  .99 is in repositories
[08:16] <dabaR> ellioTb: you just open a terminal and get the error?
[08:16] <DrakeMastil> 64Bit
[08:16] <ellioTb> reinstall ends up in dpkg-preconfigure giving an error
[08:17] <DrakeMastil> not i386
[08:17] <sn9> z9999: also, since you have not applied updates in all these months, no doubt the yellow lightbulb will appear in the top panel sometime during this update, providing messages, at least one of which will exhort you to reboot at your convenience

[08:18] <bobbie__4> Linux rules
[08:18] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, that specific error could be due to a number of issues...  have you asked in #wine if anyone had similiar issues?

[08:21] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, right, there is no root account in ubuntu (unless yo uenable it)
[08:21] <ellioTb> dabaR, i fixed it, just did a dpkg-reconfigure
[08:21] <DrakeMastil> FLH: not that I know of... SPM time then right?
[08:22] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: hey, I just got an idea. well, you had that idea hours ago, so I am not sure whether to be proud of my idea, or sad that I did not listen to you. boot recovery, and run sudo adduser heiro;sudo adduser heiro admin;sudo adduser heiro audio and then try logging into gnome as the heiro user.
[08:22] <NightStalker_07> can anyone help with edgy wireless issues, the ubuntu wiki didn't help much
[08:22] <dabaR> ellioTb: good work, I already kinda gave up
[08:22] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, my guess is that it isn't able to compile because gcc and other compile tools aren't installed (they aren't by default)
[08:23] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:exactly why I asked you in the first place lol
[08:23] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, so in console do this:     sudo apt-get install build-essential
[08:23] <ellioTb> dabaR, lol, thanks though, you kinda gave me the idea
[08:23] <dabaR> FunnyLookinHat: is it really possible to compile a 64 bit version of wine, a win32 emulator?
[08:23] <DrakeMastil> FLH: ok its installing
[08:24] <sn9> dabaR: not really
[08:24] <DrakeMastil> FLH: done
[08:24] <dabaR> !nicktab > DrakeMastil
[08:24] <fyrestrtr> dabaR: sudo adduser heiro -G admin,users,audio -s /bin/bash <-- this is the command, the one you listed will error out after the first command, since you can't add a user that already exists :)
[08:25] <dabaR> well, no, but that sounds good too.
[08:25] <FunnyLookinHat> dabaR, yes, lol.  because you are compiling something to interface with a 64bit kernel
[08:25] <DrakeMastil> dabaR: thanks :P
[08:25] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, now try to do the wine compile again
[08:25] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:thanks I'll be right back with the results
[08:25] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: good luck

[08:28] <DrakeMastil> FunnyLookinHat: yep... i a PC tech... and my boss suggested i got into linux so he could pay me more
[08:28] <fyrestrtr> tengo: you need to make sure your refresh rates are listed correctly for your monitor type. If its laggy, and you are sure the refresh rates are correct, then you probably need accelerated drivers for your video card.
[08:28] <slicky> almost..
[08:29] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, I also HIGHLY suggest you ditch the 64-bit installation and just go with a regular 32-bit...   better driver support and more packages available...
[08:29] <fyrestrtr> DrakeMastil: your boss is giving you tips to increase your pay?
[08:29] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, you're just going to make life tough on you for no real reward if you use 64bit
[08:29] <KnowledgEngi> is possible the timidiy and  fluidsinth create a conflict ???
[08:29] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: did somebody now screw up the midi howto that i perfected?
=== jbu is now known as jubu
[08:29] <DrakeMastil> fyrestrtr: we just took on a contract who uses ubuntu work stations and servers
=== david__ is now known as istuk
[08:30] <tengo> all of my windows are really laggy in ubuntu, same with scrolling up and down pages
[08:30] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: because it's not supposed to tell you to manually use the -iA option
[08:30] <DrakeMastil> fyrestrtr: so he thought i was the guy for the job since i enjoy command line anything so he kinda gave me the nudge in the right direction
[08:30] <dabaR> tengo: do you have more than 128 of RAM?
[08:30] <eth0s> Can anyone help me with XGL?
[08:30] <tengo> dabar: yes, i have 512
[08:30] <fyrestrtr> eth0s: check #ubuntu-xgl
[08:30] <tengo> dabar, and my video card is fine, it goes slow whenever i change to 1024x768
[08:30] <eth0s> thx
[08:30] <dabaR> tengo: did you use top to see whether some process is hogging up memory or cpu?
[08:31] <fyrestrtr> tengo: what video card do you have?
[08:31] <DrakeMastil> FunnyLookinHat: welp i just installed and Stormx2 suggested since i have a 64bit cpu to go 64bit so i did xD
[08:31] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: and, yes, fluidsynth may create a conflict
[08:31] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, You can also just force it to use the 386 package on 64 system:   http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185557
[08:31] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, cool, well good luck with it  :
[08:31] <FunnyLookinHat> : )
[08:31] <KnowledgEngi> ok now i remove fluidsinth
[08:31] <tengo> fyrestrtr nvidia geforce 4
[08:31] <DrakeMastil> FunnyLookinHat: I'm just gonna scrap this install and go 32bit lol
[08:32] <FunnyLookinHat> DrakeMastil, good call.  : )
[08:32] <fyrestrtr> tengo: what driver are you using? Type this in a terminal from X : glxinfo | grep direct
[08:32] <istuk> can someone direct me to a good web based admin for my server? (just a server in the house - nothing special)
[08:32] <DrakeMastil> FunnyLookinHat: thanks for the help
[08:32] <NightStalker_07> Can anyone help me with wireless for edgy? The wiki was no real help, and my wireless worked fine under dapper.
[08:32] <fyrestrtr> istuk: you can try webmin, but its not supported under ubuntu.
[08:32] <istuk> is there one that is supported
[08:32] <istuk> ?
[08:32] <amicke> Is there any way to restor ubuntu to old setting.. to turn back time?
[08:32] <tengo> fyrestrtr: x error of failed request:  badalloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[08:33] <fyrestrtr> honestly, I never used one; so don't know.
[08:33] <istuk> Ok thanks :-)
[08:33] <tengo> fyrestrtr and a whole bunch of other stuff
[08:33] <FirstStrike> !edgy
[08:33] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[08:33] <FirstStrike> hmm
[08:33] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: if you installed with synaptic, you can remove with synaptic
[08:33] <KnowledgEngi> normally i use synaptic
[08:33] <dabaR> amicke: usually backing up config files will do the trick for some issues, but to downgrade from say edgy to dapper, no, not really.
[08:34] <infidel> what file binds special keys like on laptops?
[08:34] <tengo> fyrestrtr should i install the nvidia drivers?
[08:34] <KnowledgEngi> and when is needed i add repository in sinaptyc
[08:34] <FunnyLookinHat> NightStalker_07, I can't help you now but I can try to give you some assistance tommorow....  (it's late here and I hav eto go)....  Try coming in here during the day tommorow and a lot of support should be around for wireless issues
[08:34] <KnowledgEngi> now i has remover fluidsynth, qsynth, libfluidsynth, timiditi
[08:34] <fyrestrtr> tengo: yes.
[08:34] <KnowledgEngi> timidity
[08:34] <sn9> infidel: on ubuntu, System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
[08:34] <KnowledgEngi> removed
[08:34] <NightStalker_07> FunnyLookinHat: alright, thanks
[08:35] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: keep timidity
[08:35] <dabaR> infidel: see man xmodmap, maybe that is it
[08:35] <infidel> sn9, yeah but what file is it?
[08:35] <KnowledgEngi> sometime i have paranoia that removin some pakage, the removing do not remove the configuration files
[08:35] <barachie> hello, does anybody know something about the 'sit0' interface?  it showed up after entering in the 'iwconfig' command and im wondering what it is. thanks.
[08:35] <sn9> infidel: you're asking where it stores the prefs?
[08:35] <tengo> sn9 which nvidia packages did you say i should install?
[08:36] <KnowledgEngi> i must reinstall timidity ???
[08:36] <infidel> sn9, yeah
[08:36] <fyrestrtr> tengo: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Video
[08:36] <dabaR> KnowledgEngi: see man apt-get the --purge option
[08:36] <sn9> tengo: nvidia-glx, and if you care, linux-k7 for the athlon-specific kernel and modules
[08:36] <amicke> dabaR: hmm but does the ubuntu cd have like repair possiblity?
[08:36] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: don't remove timidity in the first place
[08:37] <dabaR> amicke: ya, reinstallation like only.
[08:37] <KnowledgEngi> i has removed timitidy 5 minuts ago
[08:37] <dabaR> barachie: ask google, it has some info
[08:38] <amicke> dabaR:  ok :/
[08:38] <KnowledgEngi> gh the man pages about apt-get is in english
[08:38] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: then put it back, along with whatever patches and/or soundfont you want to use
[08:38] <KnowledgEngi> i did not understand wath do the option --purge
[08:39] <dabaR> KnowledgEngi: the --purge apt-get remove option deletes the config files when you uninstall a package
[08:39] <KnowledgEngi> --purge consent to install removing and ovewriting the config files?
[08:39] <CaptainMorgan> is there a system clock that maintains system uptime? if so, where is it? if not, how do I get one?
[08:40] <dabaR> CaptainMorgan: did you try uptime in a terminal?
[08:40] <CaptainMorgan> ah
[08:40] <CaptainMorgan> thanks
[08:40] <infidel> sn9, any idea?
[08:40] <mdious> ph8>are you around?
[08:40] <sn9> CaptainMorgan: well, one thing you can do is just type "uptime" like so:
[08:40] <sn9>  23:40:42 up 1 day, 11:12,  2 users,  load average: 0.17, 0.17, 0.17
[08:40] <CaptainMorgan>  02:40:04 up 1 day, 23:33,  2 users,  load average: 0.25, 0.41, 0.32
[08:41] <CaptainMorgan> I imagine the second user must be root
[08:41] <tengo> fyrestrtr, sn9: thanks for your help you too...may god that doesn't exist praise you
[08:41] <KnowledgEngi> apt-get --purge remove PACKAGENAME
[08:41] <KnowledgEngi> ?
[08:41] <dabaR> don't, you'll summon the big one!!1;)
[08:41] <slicky> hi.. i use a swedish keyboard.. should i use utf-8 as layout then?
[08:41] <VigoFusion> CaptainMorgan: Yes there is,uptime in yerminal and there is a System Tool that does it graphically
[08:41] <KnowledgEngi> is correct the syntax ?
[08:41] <istuk> type who to know who the other user is
[08:41] <KnowledgEngi> sn9,
[08:41] <dabaR> tengo: heh
[08:41] <VigoFusion> yerminal? *terminal
[08:41] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: it is
[08:41] <dabaR> KnowledgEngi: not you
[08:41] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:it worked, in a way
[08:42] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: OK, are you now in Ubuntu?
[08:42] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:then I did something very terrible >.<
[08:42] <knix> How can I get the height of a font in X?
[08:43] <sn9> infidel: it's buried in hidden folders in your home folder
[08:43] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: Now I need to recover the second account's password, i just need to get into the md5sum for it
[08:43] <istuk> thanks for the help - out
[08:43] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR: don't worry about it I'm just gonna do this later
[08:43] <mdious> i need to apt-get life lol
[08:43] <mordof> hey hey i got a question! is it possible to install ubuntu server remotely!?
[08:44] <keeganX> you mean sudo apt-get life
[08:44] <mordof> nah, life isn;'t that important
[08:44] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: to recover the password, you can run passwd heiro in recovery mode
[08:44] <dabaR> it will let yu change it
[08:45] <mdious> keeganX>OH and all this time i could have had a life...i was forgetting the sudo part, no wonder i'm still the way i am lol
[08:45] <Heiroglyphics> dabaR:so i just type in passwrd heiro and thats it?
=== ethos is now known as eth0s
[08:45] <dabaR> Heiroglyphics: that will change the password for the heiro user
[08:45] <Heiroglyphics> dabar, thanks for your help and time sorry I'm such a noob
[08:45] <dabaR> no worries
[08:46] <sn9> mordof: install remotely? sometimes you just gotta be there...
[08:46] <Heiroglyphics> ok later and have fun and thanks very much
[08:46] <dabaR> see ya
[08:46] <mordof> that's no fun!!
[08:46] <mordof> sn9, but it's down in the basement.. and id on't want to go get it
[08:47] <sn9> mordof: you're in the same building and you still wanna do it remotely???
[08:47] <dabaR> haha
[08:47] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, I has removed timidity, fluidsynth, qsynth and rosegarden using --purge option
[08:47] <KnowledgEngi> now what i must to do???
[08:47] <mdious> sometimes getting up takes just too much energy...that and our server room is far to freezing to do anything in there for more than a few minutes :P
[08:47] <junglerob> Maybe the computer room is *really* cold.
[08:48] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: put timidity back, and any patches and/or soundfonts you want to use
[08:48] <KnowledgEngi> for realtime i have no problem becouse i have a kernel that use "timer frequency = 1000 hz"
[08:48] <mordof> sn9: it's the BASEMENT.. the compy is shoved in the back cold corner where it's hard to get at, lol.. took me 40 mins to set it up and turn it on
[08:48] <fnf> Hello, has anyone compiled a custom kernel in Edgy ? I have a few problems that couldn't be resolved yet.
[08:49] <fnf> anyone, please ?
[08:49] <sn9> mordof: how the blazes do you expect to install remotely if the machine isn't even powered on?
[08:49] <dabaR> !seen anyone
[08:49] <minerale> how may I use iptables to forward all connections coming in port 80 to port 8888 ?
[08:49] <ubotu> I haven't seen anyone recently
[08:50] <mordof> sn9: it's on...
[08:50] <dabaR> fnf: he has not been in the channel recently, but if you ask your question, the rest of us will try to help
[08:50] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, I need install timidity and timidity-patches-eaw ?
[08:50] <mdious> minerale> http://www.hackorama.com/network/portfwd.shtml
[08:50] <mordof> sn9: i'm not an idiot! lol.. it's running and i can use it remotely
[08:51] <fnf> dabaR: (sigh) thank you
[08:51] <keeganX> idiot
[08:51] <mdious> minerale>/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 -d xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
[08:51] <mdious> 		 --dport 8888 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2:80
[08:51] <mdious> /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -d 192.168.0.2 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
[08:51] <fnf> So, has anyone encoutered problems with a completely black console ?
[08:52] <dabaR> fnf: you compiled a custom kernel, and when you boot it you get a console that has no letters?
[08:52] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, I has install timidity and timidity-patches-eaw
[08:53] <KnowledgEngi> now what i do ?
[08:53] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: my recommendations for patches, options, and a soundfont are in the howto
[08:53] <globe> what are some cd ripper progs that produce *good* sound from cds?  Last time I ripped cds the sound quality was horrible....
[08:53] <fnf> dabaR: To ensure maximum compatibility, I have made the new kernel that as bloated as possible, but to no avail. The logs reported vesafb driver has been loaded correctly, but there was no dispaly characters.
[08:53] <keeganX> sound juicer?
[08:53] <dabaR> globe: you used sound-juicer?
[08:53] <Jordan_U> globe: Like FLAC lossless or just good mp3?
[08:53] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, Are you mean this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MidiSoftwareSynthesisHowTo
[08:54] <globe> dabaR, keeganX, thx, ill try it.
[08:54] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: yes, i wrote major parts of that page
[08:54] <dabaR> fnf: not sure what to do in that case, sorry
[08:54] <globe> Jordan_U: I dont have too much a preference, but i'd like a program that supports multiple codecs
[08:54] <corevette> whats the difference from xgl and compiz
[08:54] <fnf> dabaR: startx could bring up the X server, just in case, I suspect there's some obscure console config that caused it.
[08:54] <fnf> dabaR: Thanks anyway.
[08:55] <dabaR> fnf: welcome:)
[08:55] <mdious> gotta go, cya everyone, thanks for the company :)
[08:55] <Loco-moto> ummm,.  im trying to compile somthing here and it says    C compiler unable to create executables./....        any help
[08:55] <Jordan_U> corevette: XGL is what enables 3D effects , compiz is what actually handles how windows should wobble :)
[08:55] <dabaR> Loco-moto: did you install a compiler?
[08:56] <socrates> hi all. I would like to figure out why all french accent characters in my files are resulting in funny characters being sent over email---even when they look ok with editting the file containing the characters.. I think it's my locale settings. ANyone know what I'm talking about
[08:56] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: just don't run it as a midi server unless you really need that
[08:56] <ochosi> hi, i seem to be unable to start jackd. it says "the playback device "hw:0" is already in use." esd or anything alike doesn't seem to be running. reboot doesn't help. any ideas?
[08:56] <globe> dabaR: is Sound Juicer pretty fault tolerant (ie, somewhat scratched cd still yields a good rip)?
[08:56] <dabaR> ochosi: did you stop alsa?
[08:56] <corevette> is it risky installing xgl/compiz?
[08:56] <dabaR> globe: did for me...depends on the scratch maybe
[08:56] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: if you want it to start on boot anyway, there is a section of the page on that, too
[08:56] <Slart> Hello, when I record something using the sound recorder and then play it back it is played back in a higher pitch.. kind of when you play a soundfile with a too high sample frequency. Are there settings for this? if so, where?
[08:56] <Loco-moto> dabar:   kinda new  ushally wit kde and stuff,,   u mean like gcc or somthing,   and how do i do it
[08:56] <ochosi> dabaR, well is there still any sound if i do that?
[08:56] <corevette> and how much video memory do you need for xgl/compiz?
[08:57] <dabaR> Loco-moto: install build-essential, then try again
[08:57] <Loco-moto> thanks
[08:57] <globe> dabaR: well yea, but for example (on windows) itunes will rip most anything w/o errors, even audiograbber fouls up on scratches
[08:57] <Jordan_U> corevette: Somewhat, it is safer to use AIGLX if possible , ie if you have an intel or Nvidia card.
[08:57] <dabaR> ochosi: try this, run lsof /dev/dsp, show us output
[08:57] <corevette> jordan_u yeah i have nvidia, how much video memory do you need normally
[08:57] <dabaR> globe: I can't tell you, you should try
[08:58] <globe> dabaR: oh, i'll try ;-) thx
[08:58] <ochosi> dabaR, wow i just shut down alsa and now jackd started... why's that?
[08:58] <Loco-moto> does it matter where i install it to dabaR??   well actully it wont take ne dir i give it
[08:59] <ochosi> dabaR, lsof /dev/dsp gives no output at all
[08:59] <dabaR> Loco-moto: sudo aptitude install build-essential
[08:59] <dabaR> ochosi: well, as I understand, and I have minimal knowledge of this, is that either alsa or jack, not both.
[08:59] <dabaR> ochosi: well it works now, so don't bother
[09:00] <Loco-moto> ok that worked dandy dabaR: but it cant find any build essentials pkgs...  lol
[09:00] <fnf> corevette: The root of instability lies in the display driver, if you are lucky.
[09:00] <Slart> Loco-moto: skip the s at the end
[09:00] <dabaR> Loco-moto: you just installed build-essential, try compiling again
[09:01] <dabaR> Loco-moto: or...you are confusing me
[09:01] <Loco-moto> slart:    ty :) *smacks*
[09:01] <Jordan_U> corevette: I don't know exactly but not anything much really, beryl runs fine on even modest integrated graphics cards.
[09:01] <Loco-moto> dabar   dnt wry
[09:01] <Loco-moto> was a typo
[09:01] <slicky> &j #ubuntu/xgl
[09:01] <dabaR> Loco-moto: Oh, I get it
[09:01] <Slart> =)
[09:01] <Loco-moto> lol
[09:01] <ochosi> dabaR, ok, thanks anyway!
[09:01] <dabaR> ochosi: welcome
[09:01] <luke_> Hello folks.  I have a question.   I have 6.10 installed on my Desktop and Laptop.  However, on my desktop whenever I install something it asks that I insert the Ubuntu CD.  Any reason for this?  Is there a way to disable it?
[09:01] <fnf> corevette: beryl/compiz may be configured to run acceptably fine on a 32MB graphics card, the lower end I'm not sure as I don't own one.
[09:02] <dabaR> luke_: remove the cd line from /etc/apt/sources.list. you need to use gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list to edit it.
[09:02] <sn9> luke_: yes. it would be a checkbox in System -> Administration -> Software Properties
[09:02] <luke_> thanks :)
[09:03] <Loco-moto> i just love a compiling screen without the word "error"   just makes me wana jump with joy
[09:03] <dabaR> sn9: nice. software sources, though.
[09:03] <sn9> dabaR: sorry, looking at dapper here
[09:03] <dabaR> sn9: well, that is what it is called here anyhow, but it is a really cool applet, I like it.
[09:04] <Jordan_U> sn9: Wow, I hadn't seen the software-sopurces app before, much easier than explaining to people how to edit thier sources.list :)
=== Co_17_bth_tmn is now known as co_biasa_aja_cr_
[09:04] <Jordan_U> *sources
[09:04] <Nuked> what new widget?
[09:05] <sn9> dabaR: it's not new. it was "Software Properties" in 6.06, and in 5.10, it was buried in Synaptic
[09:06] <Jordan_U> sn9: But this new one has a much easier interface IMHO than synaptic did for repos.
[09:06] <dabaR> Jordan_U, sn9: and it is more accessible too. I mean new as in newly discovered
[09:07] <sn9> Jordan_U: in 5.10, yes. however, the 6.06 one already had the simplicity you're looking for. as the matter of fact, IMHO, the 6.06 one had an even easier interface than the 6.10 one

[09:11] <Slart> hmm.. when I'm using aoss with teamspeak I get echoes from myself... similar to using "record what u hear" in windows... ie it's not recording from the microphone only..  I cant find any setting for this.. any hints?

[09:12] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: yes, for basic midi playback, that is correct. for improved playback, use the SGM soundfont mentioned further down the page
[09:12] <huiber1> Thaks for the info, I'm reading it just now..
[09:12] <Healot> Loco-moto: it is not in uubntu official repos btw, i don't give ~

[09:14] <sigp239> what is the command to pass the ubuntu installer so it doesn't use dma for my cd drive?
[09:14] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: yes. also, unless your cpu is blazing fast, follow the steps at the bottom to reduce cpu usage. i recommend doing that even on a p4
[09:14] <Healot> man hdparm
[09:14] <KnowledgEngi> i has AMD athlon xp
[09:14] <KnowledgEngi> 32 bit
[09:15] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: yes, i would still recommend reducing cpu usage as described at the bottom
[09:15] <dabaR> sigp239: there is some info here, but not exactly what you ask, I don't think: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DMA

[09:16] <FluxD>  hi I am trying to install beryl on edgy. this repo (deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main)is not working do I have to use the svn one?
[09:16] <Kvek> Can i please get some help?
[09:16] <huiber1> !dma
[09:16] <ubotu> dma is Direct Memory Access/Addressing. It makes hard disks & optical drives transfer data faster, and is almost always enabled in Ubuntu 6.06. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DMA
[09:16] <Healot> man hdparm >> sigp239
[09:16] <Log1x> Does Ubuntu have a problem with Virtual PC 2004 ?
[09:17] <darko3d> i'm installing beryl on aiglx, and this command sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, will upgrade all the list, whereas i only want it to upgrade those two   ssh-askpass-gnome xinit xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-driver-ati ------  xserver-xorg-driver-i810  how can i do that??
[09:17] <Log1x> I'm getting a error trying to boot Id "#" respawning to fast, paused for 5 minutes
[09:17] <keeganX> I do.
[09:17] <Log1x> or something
[09:17] <Log1x> disabled for 5 minutes
[09:17] <Jordan_U> FluxD: No, there are other repos see the ununtu wiki.
[09:17] <Log1x> and its going non stop

[09:17] <Log1x> is there something i can do to stop this Id "#" respawning to fast: disabled for 5 minutes :x
[09:17] <Log1x> It's just doing random numbers 1-6
[09:18] <Log1x> in place of the # i had above
[09:18] <Kvek> these numbers are 303.
[09:18] <sn9> Kvek: is it stuck?
[09:18] <Kvek> yes
[09:18] <huiber1> Log1x, this message might come when Linux is not able to setup tty consoles at boot.........
[09:18] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, I have this soundfont: /home/user/soundfonts/GM.sf2
[09:18] <KnowledgEngi> I need just edit /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg and add the line: soundfont /home/user/soundfonts/GM.sf2
[09:18] <KnowledgEngi> ??
[09:19] <dabaR> darko3d: to upgrade a specific package only, try giving an install command for that particualr package
[09:19] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: the soundfont i recommend is called SGM-180 or something similar
[09:19] <huiber1> I got this problem once in 1998, after compiling my own kernel
[09:19] <huiber1> Never heard it happen to anybody not fiddling around with the kernel.
[09:19] <darko3d> what is the correct command
[09:19] <FluxD> thx  Jordan_U is svn or the normal one better?
[09:19] <Kvek> sn9 what am i to do?
[09:19] <KnowledgEngi> is good for classical music???
[09:19] <dabaR> huiber1: nice, I learned something from you now, the search command.
[09:20] <sn9> Kvek: what was the last thing it did before it got stuck?
[09:20] <KnowledgEngi> i study music composer in a music school
[09:20] <omkar86> hi I installed xubuntu-desktop but now my old gdm style has gone, how to restore gdm?
[09:20] <dabaR> darko3d: sudo aptitude install <packageName>
[09:20] <Kvek> well i have a bunch on 303.numbers
[09:20] <huiber1> dabaR, I'm just reading the Wiki, there are many more commands, quiette fun.
[09:20] <enyc> Hrrm, I am not sure who to assign this bug to :-  https://://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cdrtools/+bug/70098 -- lpease tell me what procedure this sort of things goes thrugh // howto get it looked at / what I can do to help / etc. ;-)
[09:20] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: the SGM-180 would definitely be sufficient for classical
[09:20] <dorian_> doyou speke french?
[09:20] <dabaR> !fr
[09:20] <devilsadvocate> omkar86, in setiing go to login screen and select the gdm theme of your choice
[09:20] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.

[09:21] <darko3d> thanks
[09:21] <sn9> Kvek: ohhhhhhhh...
[09:21] <Kvek> yeah
[09:21] <sn9> Kvek: that's called a "kernel oops"
[09:21] <dabaR> sn9: in technical jjargon
[09:22] <Kvek> what do i do?
[09:22] <sigp239> Healot how does hdparm help?  i am looking for the option to pass the ubuntu installer so my cd-rom drive will work right.  i think it needs to have dma disabled
[09:22] <imsdle> I have just pulled out my old harddisk, and put it in my ubuntu new computer... but i can't mount it. the old computer was fedora core 5.. any idea
[09:22] <imsdle> s
[09:22] <imsdle> ?
[09:22] <enyc> Somebady please tell we the correct channel in which to discuss Ubuntu-bugs ;-)
[09:22] <sigp239> what is the command to pass the ubuntu installer so it doesn't use dma for my cd drive?
[09:22] <Healot> sigp239: man hdparm and thou shall know
[09:22] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, what seems to be the problem?
[09:23] <slicky> hm.. i cant make my xmodmap load at startup..
[09:23] <imsdle> I don't know how to find the harddisk.. and i don't know how to mount it
[09:23] <sod75> imsdle: check how the partitions are called via dmesg
[09:23] <Kvek> what can i do ?
[09:23] <imsdle> i have done all the mkdir /media/ohd
[09:23] <imsdle> and all that
[09:23] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, did you restart your computer after you put in the new hard disk?
[09:23] <sn9> Kvek: well, if it happened during installation, you're really in for a lot of headaches if you want anything to work, unless of course, it's a one-time fluke
[09:23] <imsdle> yes...
[09:24] <sod75> them mount with " mount /dev/hdx /media/ohd1 "
[09:24] <nilson> anyone here using BIND on their Ubuntu installation?
[09:24] <fnf> slicky: It depends on your WM or DE, what is the one you're using ?
[09:24] <sigp239> Healot: not getting it
[09:24] <KnowledgEngi> sn9, i has not find the soundfont that you concile me !!
[09:24] <nilson> My BIND seems to be running but its not listening
[09:24] <slicky> fnf:  huh? i want to use xmodmap.se
[09:24] <Kvek> so is it not going to work sn9
[09:24] <dabaR> enyc: well, there is a #ubuntu-bugs, but you reported it, and can really only wait, pay someone to work on it, or work on it yourself.
[09:24] <enyc> nilson: Ive dealt with DNS but use  NSD and nor bind...
[09:24] <imsdle> i get mount: special device /dev/hdx does not exist
[09:24] <sn9> Kvek: did it only happen once?
[09:24] <huiber1> sigp239, at boot time, edit the boot line, and append:
[09:24] <huiber1> --ide=nodma
[09:24] <imsdle> i have tried hdb hdb2 etc etc etc etc
[09:24] <Kvek> yeah i've still got it on the screen
[09:25] <enyc> dabaR: I see... so I am not supposetd to assign it to the package maintainer or contact the maintainer ?
[09:25] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, it might be sda
[09:25] <nilson> enyc, I ran BIND for two years on Gentoo but I cant get it to work right in this new Ubuntu install
[09:25] <slicky> fnf:  i added it in the session startup program handler.. and when i reboot it gone..
[09:25] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, it it a sata hard drive?
=== [Bgod2] eisenhors is now known as eisenhors
[09:25] <imsdle> no... ide
=== eisenhors is now known as eisenhorst
[09:25] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: did you see this statement on the page? "A big list may be found at [WWW]  http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/files/readme_cfgp.htm in which the fifth soundfont from the top (SGM-whatever) is quite complete for general use with TiMidity++."
[09:25] <nilson> enyc, it's installed and running and I have my zonefile configured, but BIND doesnt seem to be listening on its port
[09:25] <fnf> slicky: Ok, so you're running Ubuntu desktop. Wait a minute, I'm not using desktop right now.
[09:25] <enyc> nilson: hrrm... trying to run authoritative dns? trying to run recurive dns? trying to rut forwarder dns?  what is happening?
[09:25] <atomikulinux> Hey there, I've just realised the hard drive ubuntu is on is faulty. I do have another one spare though. Is there an easy way to copy all the files across?
[09:25] <Kvek> Hey sn9 what am i to do?
[09:26] <imsdle> old 10mb drive.. runing fedore core 5... installed ubuntu onto a new hard disk.. now i want to copy my docs and emails over
[09:26] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, in a terminal run "cd /dev
[09:26] <nilson> authoritative for my domain
[09:26] <nilson> its just not responding to queries
[09:26] <imsdle> yup
[09:26] <KnowledgEngi> http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/files/readme_cfgp.htm
[09:26] <KnowledgEngi> i was searching here
[09:26] <Jordan_U> slicky: I believe you just need to make a file named something like .xmodmap in your home folder for it to load automatically.
[09:26] <imsdle> i get 1.4 entries
[09:26] <slicky> fnf:  okey, im using xgl berly.. and i need the xmod.se to load.. to get my keyboard right..
[09:26] <imsdle> 1.4 billion... listings i mean
[09:26] <sn9> Kvek: try the installation a second time to see whether it happens again
[09:26] <devilsadvocate> 1.4 billion?
[09:26] <Kvek> ok
[09:27] <imsdle> lots and lots
[09:27] <devilsadvocate> just do cd /dev
[09:27] <sod75> imsdle: do "dmesg | grep hd" " and check what your drive is, it can be hda, hdb, hdc, etc...
[09:27] <slicky> Jordan_U:  oh, so i just copy the xmodmap.se from /usr/share/xmodmap/ to my homedir?
[09:27] <fnf> slicky: You may put "xmodmap xmodmap.se" into your ~/.xinitrc script
[09:27] <devilsadvocate> then, do "ls |grep da
[09:27] <devilsadvocate> "
[09:27] <enyc> nilson: well what I can say... is that if you dont want recursion you can easily install NSD instead which is more efficient and recure  but does not implement 'views' and does not implement recursion by design.. taht definitely works AND uses BIND zonefiles
[09:27] <slicky> fnf:  and that script is im my homedir?
[09:27] <imsdle> that worked!
[09:27] <enyc> nilson: have you looked for errors in the logfiles?
[09:27] <imsdle> woo hoo
[09:27] <Kvek> ok starting again
[09:27] <sn9> Kvek: if it does, you're probably gonna need more help than you can get in this channel
[09:27] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, what worked?
[09:27] <nilson> i just want to keep it simple
[09:28] <nilson> and no I havent
[09:28] <fnf> slicky: Yes, ~ means your home directory
[09:28] <fnf> slicky: 'man xinit' for more info
[09:28] <nilson> But
[09:28] <Kvek> sn9 i'm just looking for a beter alternative than win98
[09:28] <nilson> when I do /etc/init.d/bind9 stop
[09:28] <omkar86> how to disable workspace switching on mouse scroll?
[09:28] <nilson>  * Stopping domain name service...                                                                                rndc: connect failed: connection refused
[09:28] <nilson> I get that
[09:28] <phillijw> i just set up ndiswrapper and it made the eth1 interface show up and stuff. dmesg has no errors but iwlist eth1 scan doesnt return any results. help. ive used the same drivers before on another distro and they worked fine
[09:28] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, great !
[09:28] <slicky> fnf:  i dont have a .xinitrc in my ~
[09:29] <sn9> Kvek: this is likely it, but some computers are just finicky
[09:29] <enyc> nilson: its realyl easy and simple to setup nsd... you copy/change the example nsd.zones and copy all your files in and run 'sudo nsdc rebuild' and 'sudo nsdc reload' and it works
[09:29] <fnf> slicky: Then create one, GNOME by default doesn't build one into your home.
[09:29] <enyc> nilson: you will need to look in /var/log/messages or wherever it dumps errors
[09:29] <Vieng> hi all
[09:29] <Jordan_U> phillijw: Are you running edgy?
[09:29] <phillijw> dapper

[09:30] <ubotu> Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:30] <Vieng> how can i chat with my friends
[09:30] <Kvek> by the way sn9 when i sent for the disk they only sent me 1 and it's ver. 6.06
[09:30] <enyc> nilson: BIND has this annoying habit of dumping errors where you cant see them unless you go looking, so it may not start a zone but you will have no idea at first.
[09:30] <Jordan_U> Vieng: gaim ?
[09:30] <phillijw> Vieng: buy a cell phone
[09:30] <dabaR> !chat
[09:30] <sn9> KnowledgEngi: it's right near the top of that page. still the 5th one, just like the wiki says

[09:30] <Vieng> they are using yahoo messenger in Windows
[09:30] <nilson> hm
[09:30] <slicky> fnf:  kk..  so i just type the dir to my xmod file in that script? and it runs auto?
[09:30] <fnf> Vieng: Err, this is a public IRC channel, I suppose you know that.
[09:30] <phillijw> i actually like kopete
[09:30] <Jordan_U> imsdle: man umount
[09:30] <sn9> Kvek: btw, what kind of computer is it?
[09:30] <devilsadvocate> Vieng, use Gaim or Kopete
[09:30] <fnf> slicky: sure, your .xinitrc is an executable script that will be automagically called when you start the X server
[09:30] <huiber1> !man umount
[09:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about man umount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[09:33] <fnf> atomikulinux: You may use dd
[09:33] <Vieng> dabaR: and how on...
[09:33] <dabaR> omkar86: you just scroll the wheel and it changes your workspace?
[09:33] <slicky> fnf: and one other thing i just discoverd.. i cant make files in my home dir.. lol

[09:33] <Kvek> something wrong with my laptop sn9
[09:33] <fnf> slicky: ? What does 'ls -la ~' says ?
=== Log1x is now known as Lawjicks
[09:33] <omkar86> i don't want it to change workspace
[09:34] <dabaR> huiber1: play with him in private, please, /msg ubotu hi, then send him pms
[09:34] <huiber1> slicky, list all files in MY_HOME_DIR
[09:34] <Kvek> ok my screen just went blank
[09:34] <atomikulinux> fnf: okay. So i'm thinking of plugging in a spare hard drive instead of one of the cdrom drives. Then copying it over with "dd". Afterwards ill take out the ubuntu drive and put the spare drive where the ubuntu drive is
[09:34] <Vieng> which field should i fill my yahoo account in
[09:34] <omkar86> dabaR:when i click on desktop wallpaper and scroll it changes my workspace
[09:34] <atomikulinux> Any problems with that? will GRUB get all moody?
[09:34] <dabaR> cobelloy: you should disable the wrong one in bios if possible
[09:34] <slicky> fnf:  it says.. im the owner.. and the group..
[09:34] <sn9> Kvek: it's a laptop? yeah, more often than not, a kernel oops is indicative of something not quite kosher
[09:34] <VigoFusion> Vieng: Ever used Trillian or a multi client chat program? its same thing, select the client you want to use, enter the data in as registered, and game on.
[09:34] <enyc> nilson: hrrm not sure I use nsdc not rdnc ;-)
[09:35] <dabaR> omkar86: in xfce that is? I do not use xfce, so sorry, what is the issue in gnome?
[09:35] <slicky> fnf:  ow w8.. the nano_history is ownd by root.. that not right, right?
[09:35] <cobelloy> dabaR: I have one sound card and a usb audio device - I need both
[09:35] <imsdle> i have a problem.. i have mounted all the hdb (hdb, hdb1, hdb2) but they only seem to have the root partition.... i.e. the fedora core 5 partition.. how do i find the other partitions on the hdb?
[09:35] <cobelloy> dabaR: but right now all sounds come from usb device
[09:35] <Jordan_U> atomikulinux: You can tell grub to look for new / differendt partitions with the update-grub command.
[09:35] <fnf> atomikulinux: It really depends on your configuration, the best way IMO is to move your home dir into a safe partition then thrash the driver, in case you didn't keep your home dir in a separate partition.
[09:36] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[09:36] <omkar86> dabaR: i think gnome doesn't change it, thanx anyways
[09:36] <fnf> slicky: That's unusual, I guess you did call nano the first time as root.
[09:36] <devilsadvocate> imsdle, you need to mount each of the partitions on a different mounoint
[09:36] <atomikulinux> I sorta understand....
[09:36] <nilson> enyc is NSD in apt
[09:36] <Jordan_U> atomikulinux: You will need to run update-grub by chrooting into your current install with a liveCD
[09:36] <atomikulinux> Let me just reboot with this new hard drive in
[09:36] <atomikulinux> 3 minutes :)
[09:36] <slicky> fnf:  ow.. kk.. i fixed it.. just chown n stuff ;D
[09:37] <Vieng> ok o'll try thanks all
[09:37] <enyc> nilson: yes, in universe
[09:37] <fnf> atomikulinux: Plain copying into another partition could work, but most likely will not work out-of-the-box.
[09:37] <huiber1> Has anybody got ekiga running?
[09:37] <huiber1> I tries the setup yesterday, but don't have anybody to call :(
[09:37] <nilson> completely new to debian/ubuntu-what is universe
[09:37] <johnnythawte> does anybody really use Openbox or FVWM ?
[09:37] <dabaR> Vieng: there is a tutorial at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/GaimHowto
[09:37] <nilson> Im from gentoo
[09:37] <enyc> nilson: it is very stable/reliable but not suitable if you want 'views' or 'recursion'
[09:37] <nilson> how do I get it
[09:37] <Jordan_U> !universe | nilson
[09:37] <ubotu> nilson: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:38] <dabaR> nilson: read the components link to see the concept, then see the repositories to see the usage
[09:38] <kaur> can i use any other than the generic kernel with edgy?
[09:38] <devilsadvocate> johnnythawte, i have fvwm. i use fluxbox though mostly
[09:38] <huiber1>  !EasySource > me
[09:38] <slicky> fnf:  kk.. so my startupscript looks like this:  line 1: #!/bin/sh    line2: /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.se      is that ok?
[09:38] <xsje> Hi All! How do i switch the vmware serverconsole from full screen to windowed screen?
[09:38] <Jordan_U> nilson: By editing your xources.list file or with System -> Administration -> Software sources.
[09:39] <johnnythawte> devilsadvocate: what's the appeal of using the lightweight window manager on today's hardware ?
[09:39] <johnnythawte> (honestly curious)
[09:39] <fnf> slicky: xinitrc is a general way to build your own startup script but that is not guaranteed to work across all DEs and WMs. Usually I use the native method that a DE/WM provides. GNOME deleted your startup command in Sessions is weird. Just give it a try.
[09:39] <dabaR> cobelloy: the best I can do is direct you to this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems, crimsun knows lots, try catching him some time.
[09:39] <nilson> I don't have a GUI :P
[09:39] <nilson> I'll edit the sources.list
[09:39] <fnf> slicky: No.
[09:39] <devilsadvocate> johnnythawte, i dont have todays hardware :)
[09:39] <enyc> nilson: i.e. "different answers to different networks" or "a server you can point at with /etc/resolv.conf to do dns-lookups" , are not implemented, essentially by choices at design-time.
[09:39] <johnnythawte> devilsadvocate: ah, well that makes sense then!
[09:39] <dabaR> johnnythawte: no unneded usage of pixels, I use openbox, and am in love with the UI.
[09:39] <fnf> slicky: It is 'xmodmap /usr/share/xmodma/xmodmap.se'
[09:39] <nilson> enyc I don't need to do anything but run the DNS for my domain NSD should work fine
[09:39] <johnnythawte> openbox seems pretty cool
[09:40] <enyc> nilson: (nsd runs k.root-servers.net. and h.root-servers.net.)
[09:40] <slicky> fnf:  ow.. kk =)  thanks
[09:40] <enyc> nilson: thats a good choice then. i know it works on at least dapper
[09:40] <johnnythawte> I dislike the unneeded pixels in Gnome
[09:40] <fnf> slicky: man is your friend ;) 'man xmodmap'
[09:40] <devilsadvocate> johnnythawte, besides, sometimes you dont want all those bells and whistles. i find fluxbox if much much more efficient in terms of use than xfce, for example, and even gnome
[09:40] <xsje> How do i switch the vmware serverconsole from full screen to windowed screen?
[09:40] <dabaR> johnnythawte: hehe...
[09:40] <johnnythawte> I've been working on a guide for window managers in ubuntu
[09:40] <johnnythawte> so I've been installing all of them
[09:41] <johnnythawte> I used to use Blackbox a lot, way back when
[09:41] <dmnd> hello, i would like to install Xubuntu but i cannot find the download cd's?
[09:41] <dmnd> yes, i am new to ubuntu :)
[09:41] <slicky> fnf:  kk, thanks for your help.. ill restart x now.. and see if it works :D
[09:41] <devilsadvocate> johnnythawte, i'v tried e17, fluxbox, fvwm, fvwm-crystal. couldnt get the last to work though
[09:41] <fnf> slicky: see you :)
[09:42] <nevermind> hi channel
[09:42] <dabaR> !download | dmnd
[09:42] <ubotu> dmnd: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[09:42] <johnnythawte> e17 has some cool effects, but it's just so strange
[09:42] <dmnd> with Xubuntu, can i get E17 to work?
[09:42] <johnnythawte> I think ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu are all pretty much the same thing, just different packages
[09:42] <fnf> johnnythawte: Have you tried IceWM yet :) ? That's absolutely rocks. Simple yet elegantly implemented.
[09:42] <dmnd> ok
[09:42] <dmnd> :)
[09:42] <johnnythawte> fnf: I'm actually just about to install that right now... I just opened the homepage
[09:42] <nilson> enyc, so I enabled the universe repository; is there anything I need to do to get apt to recognize that or re-parse the config file?
[09:42] <globe> johnnythawte: are you posting this guide somewheres?
[09:43] <nilson> 'cause apt-cache isn't showing me nsd
[09:43] <johnnythawte> globe: yeah, when I'm done with it :)
[09:43] <dabaR> dmnd: http://www.xubuntu.org/get actually. You can get e17 rnning with xubuntu same as with ubuntu or kubuntu or ubuntu-server
[09:43] <fnf> johnnythawte: You'll most likely have a comfortable experience with it. I doesn't have many eye-candy, but that's not its goal anyway.
[09:43] <dmnd> dabaR: great, i am coming from gentoo and want to give ubuntu a try :)
[09:43] <devilsadvocate> johnnythawte, e17 is amazing,if only it dint screw up once in a while. I found fvwm-crystal to be the strange one !
[09:44] <dmnd> heard some good stuff about it
[09:44] <dabaR> heh, second gentoo convert in a few minutes
[09:44] <trench-> e17 ready for ubuntu?
[09:44] <dmnd> oh is it? :)
[09:44] <dabaR> yes you are
[09:44] <dabaR> ;)
[09:44] <globe> johnnythawte: good idea (the guide).  Thanks in advance for your work. ;-)
[09:44] <dmnd> :D
[09:44] <johnnythawte> I really like the DCOP interface in KDE
[09:44] <devilsadvocate> trench-, e17 isnt ready for anything. Its in alpha. but its  good.
[09:44] <johnnythawte> very cool stuff
[09:44] <wilsgrant> Question: If I install (x)ubuntu on an external HD, will I be able to usb boot into it on computers other then the one I installed the OS on?
[09:44] <nilson> I'm still using Gentoo on my desktop; switching the server for now
[09:44] <cobelloy> dabaR: thanks - but no info on this issue there
[09:44] <trench-> devilsadvocate, i see...is it on svn or the like?
[09:45] <dabaR> cobelloy: did you try the listing of available sound devices, and see both devices there?
=== user-land_ is now known as user-land
[09:45] <fnf> wilsgrant: Yes, if you configured the BIOS to boot on USB devices. It's like Linux on a floppy
[09:46] <devilsadvocate> trench-,  there is a repo somewhere
[09:46] <dabaR> wilsgrant: well, the two computers would have to be exactly the same hardware, and both would have to have a grub installed, if I understand the theory correctly, but I think the easy answer is no.
[09:46] <trench-> devilsadvocate, gotcha...thx
[09:46] <lsproc> Hi
[09:46] <dabaR> fnf: really?
[09:46] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: No, but there is a way to do what I think you want...
[09:46] <wilsgrant> dabaR: so ubuntu won't detect the hardware on boot?
[09:46] <lsproc> I have 2 annoying problems, the first one is that I don't want my Windows drives to be mounted on boot, how do I turn that off?
[09:46] <wilsgrant> Jordan_U: What is that?
[09:46] <dabaR> wilsgrant: I think I should shut up about this since I have no clue
[09:46] <fnf> dabaR: You could have installed GRUB on that driver also. That'll make it independent.
[09:47] <nilson> so I enabled the universe repository in sources.conf; is there anything I need to do to get apt to recognize that or re-parse the config file?
[09:47] <johnnythawte> I really want to install Compiz or Beryl, but I've been running Ubuntu from a vmware vm
[09:47] <VigoFusion> 3.5 floppies are going the way 5" did, and Cassette Tapes, which I still use on my TRS-80
[09:47] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[09:47] <devilsadvocate> lsproc, remove the respective lises from fstad
[09:47] <sigp239> when i try to install ubuntu i get error "Buffer I/O error on device hdc"
[09:47] <dabaR> nilson: sudo aptitude update
[09:47] <lsproc> devilsadvocate: ok
[09:47] <lsproc> second problem
[09:47] <nilson> im using apt-get though will that still work
[09:47] <trench-> johnnythawte, shouldn't matter
[09:47] <dabaR> nilson: use aptitude !1
[09:47] <trench-> if your pc's fast enough
[09:48] <johnnythawte> trench-: the instructions say it requires openGL hardware
[09:48] <trench-> otherwise forget it
[09:48] <lsproc> i have to run ifdown eth1 && iwconfig eth1 ap any && ifup eth1 every time I reboot, due to the bcm43xx driver. Can I make it run the iwconfig eth1 ap any before it brings up the interface?
[09:48] <johnnythawte> my PC is plenty fast, I have no speed problems
[09:48] <nilson> fuck that I tried to install NFS with aptitude and ended up removing ubuntu-standard
[09:48] <nilson> and had to reinstall
[09:48] <trench-> ah...vmware drivers
[09:48] <johnnythawte> just vmware isn't one of the supported chipsets
[09:48] <slicky> fnf:  it worked :D   but hoe do i disable the shift+backspace function... so my x dosent restart
[09:48] <slicky> how*
[09:48] <trench-> just do a dual-boot instead
[09:48] <trench-> :)
[09:48] <dabaR> nilson: hehe, then just use apt-get update...
[09:49] <fnf> slicky: Wait a minute, I need to 'man xorg.conf'
[09:49] <johnnythawte> trench-: I'm debating on whether to do a dual-boot onto an external hard drive (usb)  any experience with that ?
[09:49] <dabaR> nilson: it is a useful tool to learn to use, aptitude is...
[09:49] <kaur> can i use any other than the generic kernel with edgy?
[09:49] <johnnythawte> I don't really feel like resizing my main partition
[09:49] <slicky> fnf:  hm kk, ill man it to
[09:49] <nilson> it doesnt look hard I just dont want to mess with it right now
[09:49] <atomikulinux> Okay the hard drive is in..
[09:49] <nilson> I'm accustomed to doing it via the commandline anyway with emerge
[09:49] <devilsadvocate> lsproc, i think you add the lines to /etc/rc.local
[09:49] <cobelloy> dabaR: both cards are working, they show up in alsamixer
[09:49] <wilsgrant> Jordan_U: This is an external (250 GB) USB hard drive... I was thinking of just unplugging my internal HD (to keep it simple) boot up on the xubuntu disk and telling it to install on the USB HD. This should work fine, the thing I can concerned about is if I use this external HD to boot up on a completly different computer if it will fail because of the change in hardware, or adapt when it boots like a live CD would
[09:49] <dabaR> lsproc: you can add those commands to a script and add that script to boot...
[09:50] <trench-> johnnythawte, there's nothing wrong with that, as long as your mobo actually supports booting from an external drive
[09:50] <cobelloy> dabaR: im not even sure how they got swapped around
[09:50] <dabaR> cobelloy: OK, ask crimsun when you see him.
[09:50] <johnnythawte> trench-: that's a good question... not sure. It's a laptop
[09:50] <lsproc> dabaR: Isnt there a preup thingy somewhere?
[09:50] <fnf> slicky: Ok, take a look at the ServerFlags section, you may put an 'Option "DontZap"' to /etx/X11/xorg.conf. That'll do it.
[09:50] <cobelloy> but my keyboard layout was changed somehow too
[09:50] <dabaR> lsproc: maybe.
[09:50] <PZ> is mark a spammer?
[09:50] <PZ> http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse/2006-11/msg03765.html
[09:50] <johnnythawte> I really could use a second computer
[09:50] <johnnythawte> but I'm freaking broke
[09:50] <johnnythawte> hehe
[09:51] <trench-> johnnythawte, one way to find out is to check the bios, look into the boot order...if it indicates external, removable, for boot option, you're set
[09:51] <darko3d> the beryl installation guide says: The modifications : Needs to be in the Screen section: how do i get there
[09:51] <atomikulinux> So... the hard drive is in... Now what?
[09:51] <slicky> fnf:  hm.. but its shift+backspace
[09:51] <atomikulinux> I guess I need to format it... how
[09:51] <johnnythawte> I might just partition magic my primary partition
[09:51] <fnf> slicky: What does Shift+Backspace do :-/ ?
[09:51] <trench-> darko3d, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:51] <johnnythawte> I'm just worried about trashing my system
[09:51] <slicky> fnf:  it puts me at the login screen
[09:51] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: For the most part it will adapt, you will need to update a few things like the xorg.conf and fstab though, if you follow the guide I gave you you won't need to do that but the system may run slower and you won't be able to do kernel upgrades.
[09:52] <darko3d> so it's sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:52] <trench-> yes
[09:52] <trench-> if you use gedit
[09:52] <trench-> <-- nano guy
[09:52] <dabaR> PZ: yes.
[09:52] <PZ> auau ;)
[09:52] <slicky> fnf:  hm.. xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"  <-- will it work?
[09:52] <fnf> slicky: That's not X server's behavior, probably GNOME-related. In that case I have no idea. Try taking a look at System --> Preferences --> Keyboard Shortcuts
[09:53] <atomikulinux> fnf... How do I get into this hard drive? I need to format it or something
[09:53] <fnf> slicky: It would, not really elegant if you ask me though.
[09:53] <VigoFusion> johnnyhawte: I use to could help you there, but we stopped takeing PCs at the Mission, to many people donated , got a $2500 tax write off and then gawfed when there emails were sent from 4rth genereation settings. I can only remove so much data, the rest takes about $10,000 in hardware.
[09:53] <wilsgrant> Jordan_U: So the fact that the guide was written for a pen drive doesn't matter?
[09:53] <fnf> atomikulinux: Please restate, what do you have now ?
[09:54] <atomikulinux> Well, ive got my spare hard drive plugged in... I just need to find out what to do with ti now
[09:54] <slicky> fnf:  oow.. it worked :D
[09:54] <nilson> enyc, so with NSD where are the zonefiles
[09:54] <fnf> slicky: Great.
[09:54] <Marlun> I'm trying to install Ubuntu on Virtual PC but during the early part of the installation I get an error that it can't detect and mount the CD. I'm using an ISO image from my harddrive to install, what should I do?
[09:54] <dabaR> darko3d: use gksudo instead, though, whenever you need to run a graphical app with sudo privileges
[09:54] <fnf> atomikulinux: Is your drive an IDE or a SATA ?
[09:54] <nilson> It says the filenames are relative to ${zonesdir} with no indication of what the hell that is
[09:54] <slicky> finally.. my ubuntu is done ;D
[09:54] <atomikulinux> fnf: Uhhh... IDE
[09:54] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: I don't think so but I don't know for sure , the main question would be whether syslinux can be installed to a normall HD, which I believe it can.
[09:54] <fnf> atomikulinux: Sorry, I just acknowledge yours in an USB
[09:55] <trench-> Marlun, that's Virtual PC issue...not ubuntu
[09:55] <fnf> atomikulinux: Ok..
[09:55] <wilsgrant> I could install applications and retain them using this guide's method too, right?
[09:55] <dabaR> one's ubuntu is never really done.
[09:55] <Marlun> trench-: ok, but I thought that maybe I could just skip that part of the installation and it would continue using the iso.
[09:55] <fnf> atomikulinux: IDE devices are listed in /dev in order: Your first drive would be named hda1, 2nd is hda2 and so on.
[09:56] <fnf> atomikulinux: I mean your partitions, HDDs are listed in hda, hdb.... order
[09:56] <trench-> maybe try vmware...i'm not familiar with vpc
[09:56] <atomikulinux> fnf: okay sec
=== PZ is now known as GNAM
[09:57] <atomikulinux> I have.... a hda and a hda1
[09:57] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: If you just want to move Ubuntu when you buy another PC or something go with a regular install and reconfigure what needs reconfiguring, if you want to have your own system with you to be able to boot on any machine and go then go with the guide.
[09:57] <atomikulinux> there should be another one though... theres 3 hard drives in my machine. theres a 1GB one that is used for swap space I think
[09:58] <fnf> atomikulinux: So you currently have a hardrive and one partition on that, is that your only HDD ?
[09:58] <atomikulinux> Oh wait
[09:58] <dabaR> fnf: use sudo fdisk -l to list hard drive info
[09:58] <fnf> dabaR: Ah, sure, 'ls -la /dev/hd*' could also do the trick though.
[09:58] <devilsadvocate> atomikulinux, do "cd /dev" and then ls |grep da"
[09:59] <atomikulinux> I have 3 hard drives... One hard drive is linux. One hard drive is a 1GB one which I havent really done anything with.. although I think ubuntu said it was gonna use it as swap space when I installed it. and theres another one... the spare one which I wanna cop the stuff through
[09:59] <atomikulinux> Each hard drive has one partition I believe
[09:59] <dabaR> fnf: it could, but the command gives useful info
[09:59] <wilsgrant> Second option is what I want, I have installed regular Ubuntu before in fact I am typing this from an ubuntu VM I made being played inside vista
[09:59] <dmnd> *shivers*
[09:59] <fnf> dabaR: Right.
[10:00] <atomikulinux> devilsadvocate: Your command returns: hda hda1 ptyda ttyda
[10:00] <fnf> atomikulinux: Do you see another hdab, hdc other than your first drive ?
[10:00] <atomikulinux> Perhaps theres a partiton program I can open up.. I need to see how my stuff is looking
[10:00] <atomikulinux> Im not even sure that my 1GB is doing anything...
[10:00] <ochosi> dabaR, hi, i donno if you can remember, asked you about jackd prob a few hours ago
[10:00] <devilsadvocate> atomikulinux,  are your harddrives all pugged in ?
[10:00] <atomikulinux> devilsadvocate: Well...
[10:00] <dabaR> atomikulinux: just run sudo fdisk -l
[10:00] <atomikulinux> They appear to be...
[10:01] <devilsadvocate> :|
[10:01] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: If you do try it tell me how it turnes out.
[10:01] <atomikulinux> not sure if the bios has recognised em
[10:01] <atomikulinux> I forgot to check
[10:01] <ochosi> dabaR, actually, my sound seems to be broken now. any idea why that could be? (i uninstalled jackd again, /etc/init.d/alsasound status says the driver is loaded)
[10:01] <atomikulinux> Okay cool... fdisk looks like its returned 3 hard drives
[10:01] <devilsadvocate> atomikulinux, go "sudo fdis -l" as fnf and dabaR say
[10:01] <Vieng> I can not sign in
[10:01] <Jordan_U> can syslinux be installed on a normall USB hard drive?
[10:01] <dabaR> ochosi: sudo invoke-rc.d alsa-utils restart
[10:02] <nilson> enyc, are you still around bud
[10:02] <Vieng> it says my account is disconnected
[10:02] <atomikulinux> Yes
[10:02] <atomikulinux> Its returned 3 hard drives
[10:02] <trench-> didn't pay the bill? :)
[10:02] <dabaR> Vieng: you misconfigured it, or forgot yuor password, go check account settings with ctrl+a
[10:02] <trench-> jk
[10:02] <dabaR> atomikulinux: ya, that command is way easier that the listing of devices
[10:02] <Tido|laptop> in gnome, how do I sudo?
[10:03] <dabaR> Tido|laptop: gksudo
[10:03] <atomikulinux> Hmmmmm
[10:03] <ochosi> dabaR. did the restart, still: all the apps seem to be fine and playing, but nothing comes out of my speakers...
[10:03] <Tido|laptop> thanks dabaR
[10:03] <dabaR> ochosi: use alsamixer or the sound applet in system>prefs to see if anything is muted
[10:03] <atomikulinux> Now then... I need to format the new hard drive, and copy over everything thats on this hard dirve
[10:04] <dabaR> atomikulinux: edgy?
[10:04] <VigoFusion> Vieng: Or try logging into Yahoo! to make certain the screen name and password are correct, the China/Microsoft migration/merge goofed alotta stuff up in Yahoo.
[10:04] <atomikulinux> Yup
[10:04] <wilsgrant> Jordan_U: Couldn't I just do a regular ubuntu install on the drive then set it up to use the syslinux bootloader to make switching it between comps easy?
[10:04] <atomikulinux> it appears that this hard drive has 3 partitions... Linux,extended and swap
[10:04] <ochosi> dabaR, oh man... sorry bout that. you were right. for some stupid reason my master was muted... really sorry to keep you busy with this kid's stuff..
[10:04] <atomikulinux> I wanna put the swap drive on this other 1GB I have
[10:04] <Vieng> uhm it works thankssss
[10:04] <atomikulinux> I think GRUB is on the 1GB as well
[10:04] <enyc> nilson: yes
[10:04] <dabaR> atomikulinux: there is a command line utility, called cfdisk that formats partitions, use caution when playing with formatting, needless to say almost
[10:04] <enyc> nilson: not got out of bed yet ;-)
[10:05] <dabaR> Vieng: $20
[10:05] <atomikulinux> okay
[10:05] <VigoFusion> :-!
[10:05] <atomikulinux> lemme get this hard drive formatted
[10:05] <nilson> enyc: okay... I edited /etc/nsd/zones.conf and there is a commant which states zonefile paths are relative to ${zonesdir}
[10:05] <dabaR> ochosi: no worries:)
[10:05] <nilson> Nothing I have found yet tells me what zonesdir is
[10:05] <enyc> nilson: I thin that in /etc/nsd/primary/
=== raf is now known as vhfg
[10:06] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: It isn't the syslinux bootloader that makes everything get configured automatically at boot it is all of the various scripts on the liveCD, there is a way to use those same scripts on a regular install but I don't know how or how hard it would be.
[10:06] <fnf> atomikulinux: cfdisk is reliable and easy to use.
[10:06] <dabaR> ochosi: all these issues that I can solve are not much more substantial than that anyhow, and I choose to be here on my own will...
[10:06] <dabaR> nilson: did you try google and the official nsd docs?
[10:06] <atomikulinux> Okay so what do I do? I run cfdisk and it says "can not open hard drive"
[10:07] <atomikulinux> "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"
[10:07] <fnf> atomikulinux: OTOH, you may run gparted, but that doesn't guaranteed your boot sectors will not be messed up.
[10:07] <nilson> dabaR, yeah-they have practically none
[10:07] <atomikulinux> hmm
[10:07] <dabaR> atomikulinux: hmm, same here:-./ <--a confused cindy crawford
[10:07] <wilsgrant> Jordan_U: Alright thanks im going to do a regular install and look into those scripts on the forums when I need em. Thanks for the help!
[10:07] <atomikulinux> lol
[10:07] <atomikulinux> Well then
[10:07] <fnf> atomikulinux: Do you see other device listed in /dev ? Other than hda, do you see hdb, hdc... ?
[10:07] <atomikulinux> perhaps theres a parition program with a nice little GUI
[10:07] <ochosi> dabaR, i see :) so have a nice day man!
[10:07] <atomikulinux> that can easily do what I want it to do :D
[10:08] <atomikulinux> lol
[10:08] <dabaR> Sat Nov 25 03:08:25 CST 2006
[10:08] <fnf> atomikulinux: then use gparted.
[10:08] <atomikulinux> perhaps I should paste the results of fdisk in a diffrent channel... then you'll understand better what im hoping to do
[10:08] <slicky> oooh. im in love with berly!!
[10:08] <djperegrine> I know!
[10:08] <dabaR> ochosi: thanks, you too
[10:08] <VigoFusion> Yes, gparted should work
[10:08] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[10:08] <trench-> no humping of the monitor please
[10:08] <atomikulinux> How do I run it
[10:09] <djperegrine> beryl is the shit fo sure
[10:09] <dabaR> atomikulinux: there is a pastebin website, a really cool concept, see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[10:09] <elok_> hai
[10:09] <atomikulinux> yeah
[10:09] <fnf> atomikulinux: Alt+F2 then type into the textbox: 'gksudo gparted'
[10:09] <VigoFusion> http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
[10:09] <enyc> nilson: om on a releavnt system but I cant see it mention.ed .but I _know_ they co in /etc/nsd/primary/
[10:09] <dabaR> VigoFusion: there is a package for ubuntu...
[10:09] <atomikulinux> (gksudo:5141): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "murrine",
[10:09] <atomikulinux> sudo: gparted: command not found
[10:10] <dabaR> !gparted
[10:10] <ubotu> gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[10:10] <nilson> enyc Im workin on it I'll let you know if I get it working :P
[10:10] <fnf> atomikulinux: Ouch. Are you running ubuntu desktop ? That only exists in the desktop version, I forgot to mention.
[10:10] <Manny> hi
[10:10] <dabaR> just install it
[10:10] <nilson> enyc I think I get that part to work
[10:10] <dabaR> hi Manny
[10:10] <trench-> thanks for the livecd unfo ubotu
[10:10] <nilson> but now it wont write the db; probably a permissions issue since I had to `touch` the file to make it
[10:11] <trench-> info even
[10:11] <darko3d> if i downloaded like a 100 program, doesn't anybody know how cn i compile ubuntu with all of these programs for future use
[10:11] <Manny> I'm trying to debug an xorg crash involving FontWakeup. But I can't find xserver-xorg-dbg, which used to be distributed in 6.8.X dayds
[10:11] <dabaR> !ubotu > trench-
[10:11] <atomikulinux> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33876/
[10:11] <trench-> :)
[10:11] <trench-> pimp
[10:11] <dabaR> darko3d: no, we do not know. There is work being done to allow for something similar in the future.
[10:12] <dabaR> give credit where it is due;)
[10:13] <atomikulinux> so then...
[10:13] <dabaR> atomikulinux: I can't think that much now
[10:13] <nilson> enyc, hey bud could you tell me what your permissions are on /var/lib/nsd ?
[10:13] <djperegrine> I heard beryl is going to be inculded in the new ubuntu version or something
[10:13] <trench-> i have to give ubuntu it's props...it's been hassle-free so far :)
[10:13] <djperegrine> is that true
[10:13] <atomikulinux> ive got gparted run
[10:14] <Jordan_U> wilsgrant: If you can't find out how to use the liveCD's scripts this command should reconfigure most things but will require some interaction: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a -phigh
[10:14] <dabaR> djperegrine: that depends on the stability, but ya, I heard some similar talk as well.
[10:14] <trench-> 6.10 is very nice indeed
[10:14] <djperegrine> I think that would help ubuntus cause
[10:14] <atomikulinux> okay then.. im deleting all the paritions on the spare hard drive now...
[10:14] <atomikulinux> Done.
[10:14] <djperegrine> I mean beryl is so damn awesome!

[10:15] <trench-> djperegrine, try it with 16x AA :)
[10:15] <djperegrine> to bad the nvidia beta drivers didn't work for me
[10:15] <VigoFusion> ubuntu has accomplished what Knoppix did such a fine job on.
[10:15] <djperegrine> :O ?
[10:15] <DrakeMastil> FunnyLookinHat: even went ahead and used the source and compiled on my own to get used to doing things the hard way to learn
[10:16] <dabaR> djperegrine: you can see some related articles there.
[10:16] <Jordan_U> trench-: 16x AA ?
[10:16] <trench-> i got kubuntu and wireless configured in under 30 minutes...can't do that on my gentoo :)
[10:16] <djperegrine> I got all this PIXELMAP couldn't blit or something
[10:16] <djperegrine> and it lagged like hell
[10:16] <trench-> 16x AntiAliasing/Anisthropic
[10:16] <jarek_> hello
[10:16] <Jordan_U> trench-: ahh
[10:16] <djperegrine> the beta of beryl + the ALGLX that came with edgy works damn nice so I am not complianin
[10:16] <trench-> make sure to restart beryl when you make the change
[10:16] <djperegrine> oh I did
[10:17] <trench-> as far as enabling AA
[10:17] <djperegrine> I will wait till its not beta anymore
[10:17] <Imsdle> stuffed if i know1
[10:17] <Imsdle> !
[10:17] <trench-> if your card's capable, it's a real eye-candy...and a resource hog at the same time :)
[10:17] <The> can anyone help me get my epson stylux cx7800 all in one printer/scanners scanners working??
[10:17] <djperegrine> its not really
[10:17] <trench-> i see
[10:18] <djperegrine> the most it uses for me is 10%
[10:18] <Tido|laptop> how do I move a file in file manager when it requires sudo or root to do it?
[10:18] <trench-> what version?
[10:18] <djperegrine> the svn version
[10:19] <djperegrine> and like I said the ALGLX that came with edgy
[10:19] <DrakeMastil> lol ok I just installed WINE on edgy and now what do i do?
[10:19] <Imsdle> mount: hdb2 already mounted or /media/ohd2 busy
[10:19] <Imsdle> grrr i have done a restart..
[10:19] <djperegrine> GLX used like 30%
[10:19] <trench-> well, if you don't have much transparencies, fancy animations, auto detecting refresh, it should use little
[10:19] <dabaR> Tido|laptop: you either run the nautilus file manager with gksudo, or use a terminal. Make sure you close the nautilus after moving the files so someone does not make a mistake further down the road.
[10:19] <Jordan_U> The: System -> administration -> Printing and Applications -> graphics -> Xane image scanner
[10:19] <The> is there still support of automatix ?? in ubuntu edgy?
[10:19] <Tido|laptop> thanks dabaR
[10:19] <travkin> Automatix sux. apt-get rulez.
[10:19] <travkin> :[
[10:19] <djperegrine> GLX was a little bit smoother then ALGLX but it was using alot of CPU
[10:19] <The> I need help ...
[10:20] <The> I am not the best at this and am trying to switch.
[10:20] <dabaR> The: automatix is not recommended on this channel, they recommend easyubuntu, I heard there is automatix2 for edgy, use google for more info
[10:20] <trench-> djperegrine, with capable cards, that's hardware rendered
[10:20] <DrakeMastil> I just installed WINE on edgy and now what do i do to use it?
[10:20] <dabaR> The: did you get the printer to work, and need to get the scanner to work, or nothing works yet?
[10:20] <djperegrine> run some exe's :D
[10:20] <Jordan_U> DrakeMastil: Double click an exe.
[10:20] <fam> hi how can i change the root mode so i can work in root mode
[10:20] <The> dabaF: yes
[10:20] <dabaR> DrakeMastil: wine something.exe
[10:21] <dabaR> !root > fam
[10:21] <djperegrine> man if I can get directX + .net 2.0 working on wine I am set for life

[10:22] <The> mine doesn't seem to be working
[10:22] <Jordan_U>  Applications -> graphics -> Xane image scanner didn't work? Did it give an error?
[10:23] <The> ya
[10:23] <The> i mean
[10:23] <The> no
[10:23] <The> it said that it doesnt find a scanner
[10:23] <dabaR> Imsdle: the home was a different partition?
[10:23] <The> it say's "No divices avalible"
[10:23] <dabaR> Imsdle: try sudo fdisk -l and see whether you see some other partitions on the same drive, or something.
[10:24] <Imsdle> i think so but stuffed if i can mount them.. got a similar response from my wife tonight
[10:24] <Slart> ngngaaa.... I'm starting to dislike wine about now.. stupid software.. or stupid user.. not sure which yet...

[10:35] <atomikulinux> Nooooooo

[10:36] <dabaR> Imsdle: I am gonna look for a linux lvm file system.
[10:36] <atomikulinux> Seriously cant be bothered to reinstall... hmmm
[10:36] <trench-> i'll try there...thanks dabaR...it's really no biggie for me...just out of curiosity...thanks for your help
[10:36] <erUSUL> atomikulinux: you can use tar or cp and you need to update /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst if necessary

[10:36] <Imsdle> thanks alot dabaR.....
[10:36] <atomikulinux> Thanks erUSUL
[10:36] <atomikulinux> Now lemme just take a minute to understand what you just said :)
[10:36] <atomikulinux> lol
[10:37] <atomikulinux> Okay let me start by making a linux partition on this new hard drive...
[10:38] <erUSUL> atomikulinux: example (cd /source/directory && tar cf - . ) | (cd /dest/directory && tar xvfp -) to copy from one partition to another (obviusly you have to do it from a live cd and mount both partitions to source and dest dirs
[10:39] <atomikulinux> erUSUL: Okay cool
[10:39] <atomikulinux> BRB a sec, then we'll talk business (lol)
[10:41] <dabaR> erUSUL: do you have an idea why a linux LVM partition says device already mounted or mount point busy when mount /dev/hdb1 /media/mels_backup is ran, and mount |grep hdb1 shows no output, and there are no files in /media/mels_backup?
[10:42] <atomikulinux> Okay so I know how to copy the partitions over. Good. Now I need to sort out how to configure ubuntu to use a different parition as swap.
[10:42] <atomikulinux> And possibly reconfigure/update GRUB.
[10:42] <atomikulinux> (BRB again)
[10:42] <roryy> dabaR: is there p'raps a or other program with current working directory /media/mels_backup? try perhaps 'lsof /media/mels_backup' to try to find out
[10:43] <dabaR> well, the person left, it seems.
[10:43] <dabaR> thanks
[10:43] <d03boy> anyone know how to turn the radio on for a bcm43xx? that seems to be my predicament
[10:43] <erUSUL> dabaR: i do no use lvm myself but i have seen this errors before they went away when i disabled lvm and evms at startup but if you actually use lvm you can't do that :(

[11:00] <SilentDis> !nvidia | ranman
[11:00] <nilson> enyc, now I'll just have to spend a week unfucking Apache, PHP, setting up MySQL and getting Postfix working :)
[11:00] <ubotu> ranman: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:00] <nilson> YAY!
[11:00] <SilentDis> !cedega | ranman
[11:00] <ubotu> ranman: cedega is a project based on WINE, aimed at running Windows games on Linux. For more info, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega
[11:01] <djperegrine> I do have mplayer installed
[11:01] <djperegrine> and the plguin
[11:01] <ranman> i have gotten wow working in wine without cedega before... ubotu i have tried that but the resolutions still did not show up...
[11:01] <SilentDis> ranman:  the first link ubotu shared will help you get your graphics card running properly.  the second is how to get WoW going.
[11:02] <zipola> In apt-get the xmms-sid has the letters iB before it. What does that B mean?
[11:02] <BlackHawk> moin
[11:02] <trench-> doom3 and oblivion :)
[11:02] <ranman> i have tried the first link before, it did not work
[11:02] <slicky> hm.. can i use Cedega without signing up on their homepage?
[11:02] <SilentDis> ranman:  what, exactly, happened?
[11:02] <ranman> and i know how to use cedega and wine and I can get it to play wow...
[11:02] <trench-> ranman, you just need your nvidia-drivers installed properly
[11:03] <ranman> I had them installed and it froze on starting X
[11:03] <n30n> !multiverse
[11:03] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[11:03] <SilentDis> ranman:  I'm running a Nvidia GeForce 7600 GS, and the binary blob drivers.  i followed the instructions on that website, and it works like a charm.  it's VERY easy to overlook a step here and there, though :)
[11:04] <Morrissey> I have a kind of off topic question. In my laptop I have 2x256mb RAM, If I buy a 1gb RAM, can I use one slot for the 1gb ram, and the other for a 256 mb ram chip?
[11:04] <zipola> Does someone else have the xmms-sid working under edgy?
[11:04] <SilentDis> Morrissey:  if it's a more 'modern' mobo in the laptop, sure.  really depends on the laptop though.
[11:04] <Morrissey> SilentDis, ok, how would I know? Its about 1.5 years old
[11:04] <ranman> SilentDis: i have gotten this working before, i know how to do it... I didn't skip a step... omfg i left the xorg.conf unrestored nvm...
[11:05] <rlobster> Hi, I'm having a problem with my panels, they become unresponsive when I leave the computer for about 15 mins or so. I can still alt-tab between open windows but can't get the panels to respond to my mouse clicks
[11:05] <rlobster> anyone have any idea what the problem is?
[11:05] <SilentDis> ranman:  i kept missing the restricted modules and pulling my hair out... lol
[11:05] <ranman> rlobster: do you have gdesklets? are you using gnome?
[11:05] <SilentDis> Morrissey:  brand/model?  usually, you can grab a PDF of system specs from the manufactuerers website
[11:05] <trench-> Morrissey, that's a hardware limitation...you need to know the capability of your laptop as far as compatible upgrades
[11:06] <Imsdle> help!.... mount: /dev/hdb2 already mounted or /media/mels_backup busy
[11:06] <trench-> most modern laptops can handle a gig stick of ram no prob
[11:06] <sod75> Morrissey: look up the tech docs on the vendor's website
[11:07] <trench-> just need to know max ram it can handle
[11:07] <djperegrine> um there is no more w32codecs package?
[11:07] <trench-> don't want to buy something you can't really use
[11:07] <djperegrine> where can I get the codecs?
[11:07] <Morrissey> SilentDis, trench- sod75: Ok, I have the datasheet up, what to look for? It says I have the 2700 DDR 333mhz ram. and 2x256 of them
[11:07] <SilentDis> !w32codecs
[11:07] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[11:07] <trench-> Morrissey, max ram allowed
[11:07] <Morrissey> SilentDis, trench- sod75: And it support 2gb of ram :)
[11:08] <trench-> there you go
[11:08] <trench-> so answer to your q is yes
[11:08] <Morrissey> trench-, ok, thanks .. so it is ok to have 1x1gb and 1x256? :)
[11:08] <trench-> definitely
[11:08] <Morrissey> thanks alot trench- ... thix beryl's kinda sucking up my ram (Combined with KDE ;P)
[11:08] <trench-> no doubt
[11:08] <SilentDis> Morrissey:  usually, there's just 1 slot you can stick ram into for a laptop (some have 2, again depends on hardware), and since it supports DDR, single stick configs will be fine.  just make sure you get compatible ram (again, check that datasheet) and you should be fine
[11:09] <Morrissey> SilentDis, thanks! Ill order one today
[11:09] <infidel> anyone know where "System>>Preferences>>Keyboard Shortcut" saves the mapped txt file?
[11:09] <trench-> usually there will be two...rarely do they provide just one slot
[11:09] <Marlun> I got ubuntu installed on Virtual PC and when installing I got to choose some resolutions, but now when I've logged into Ubuntu All I've got to choose from is 800x600 and 1024x768, not 1400x900 which I did select during installation.
[11:09] <trench-> sometimes the other slot will be hidden under the keyboard, depends on laptop maker
[11:09] <SilentDis> trench-:  my laptop is ANCIENT.  it has but one spot.  really old Toshiba Satellite 2535CDS.  it's been religated to a thin client for that reason ;)
[11:10] <trench-> lol SilentDis
[11:10] <trench-> i feel your pain
[11:10] <rlobster> hi, I'm having a problem with my gnome panel, it becomes unresponsive after I leave my computer idle for about 15 mins. Any idea what the problem is?
[11:10] <trench-> "most modern laptops" (quoting self)
[11:11] <ranman> r lobster are you using gnome? and do you have gdesklets on?
[11:11] <SilentDis> trench-:  it's modern if you count a decade as modern.  rofl
[11:11] <trench-> hahahahaha
[11:11] <trench-> het, as long as it works
[11:11] <trench-> hey*
[11:11] <J-_> google earth got me all dizzy, bleh
[11:11] <SilentDis> trench-:  as I said, it enjoys continued use as a thin client lol
[11:11] <rlobster> ranman: I'm using gnome, no gdesklets
[11:12] <trench-> SilentDis, sounds good then :)
[11:12] <J-_> is there anywhere where I can get gdesklet backgrounds?
[11:14] <atomikulinux> okay im back on the live cd

[11:18] <SilentDis> Trailblazer:  if you need a proxy for your mail connect, usually, it's specified in-line.  a username of proxy.server.address.com:username@mailserver.com or some such.  really depends on what the proxy needs.
[11:18] <rlobster> hi, I'm having a problem with my gnome panel, it becomes unresponsive after I leave my computer idle for about 15 mins. Any idea what the problem is?
[11:18] <SilentDis> Trailblazer:  is it a socks5 proxy you're going through?

[11:22] <infidel> Milos_SD: it's pretty simple what are you trying to do?
[11:22] <SilentDis> !dd | Milos_SD
[11:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:23] <atomikulinux> Okay can someone listen for a sec
[11:23] <SilentDis> Trailblazer:  ahhhh, that will be specified by the admin of that proxy.  you'll have to ask them.  if you're not sure, and you're the admin on that proxy, it's time to hit the manuals for it ;)
[11:23] <atomikulinux> I was in linux a minute ago and I said this command in the channel
[11:23] <atomikulinux> Can someone paste it back
[11:23] <atomikulinux> it was this "tar" command
[11:23] <atomikulinux> its important
[11:23] <atomikulinux> right before I disconnected
[11:24] <Trailblazer> ROFL :) kewl ty
[11:24] <atomikulinux> wow
[11:24] <atomikulinux> im screwed now then
[11:24] <enyc> nilson: have fun ;-) glad to know you got nsd behaving itself ;-)
[11:24] <atomikulinux> cause no one can look up through the channel history for me
[11:24] <Milos_SD> infidel, can you tell me the right commend for copyng from cdrom-1 ?
[11:25] <atomikulinux> no one
[11:25] <SilentDis> atomkulinux:  first, you are quite aware that this channel scrolls REALLY fast, right?  second, we aren't your personal note takers.  third:  you're NEVER screwed.  please, tell us what you're looking to do, and we will do our absolute best to help you with it :)
[11:25] <infidel> atomikulinux: sorry i looked as far as i've been here and i didn't see your tar string
[11:25] <atomikulinux> hmm
[11:25] <atomikulinux> Okay lemme start again then
[11:26] <atomikulinux> I need to move linux across onto another hard drive, because the hard drive its on now is faulty...
[11:26] <infidel> atomikulinux: what is so special about that certain tar string?
[11:26] <atomikulinux> I'm on the liveCD right now so I can do this

[11:26] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[11:27] <atomikulinux> So I just need to mount the two hard drives, copy everything across then I need to know what to reconfigure afterward (Im certain that GRUB and linux isnt gonna like linux being moved over)
[11:27] <nilson> enyc, thank you for your help
[11:28] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[11:28] <atomikulinux> And for some reason I cant mount the hard drives
[11:28] <romain_> please is there a tutorial which describe how to chroot a user system ?

[11:28] <ubotu> romain_: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[11:28] <atomikulinux> What was that partition program btw?
[11:28] <atomikulinux> gpartition or something...
[11:29] <sod75> gparted
[11:29] <atomikulinux> ahhh... thats it. thanks
[11:29] <sod75> gparted

[11:31] <SilentDis> question:  trying to install package kubuntu-desktop, getting an error of "Depends: kdegraphics-kfile-plugins but it is not going to be installed".  Dapper install.  any ideas?
[11:32] <atomikulinux> Okay then...
[11:32] <J-_> look for the depending packages in synaptic
[11:32] <atomikulinux> I have my source and destination partitions mounted. Now... How to copy everything across?
[11:33] <SilentDis> J-_:  not seeing it listed.
[11:33] <atomikulinux> This is ubuntu im moving across btw so I think im going to need help reconfiguring grub and stuff...
[11:33] <kraut> moin
[11:34] <SilentDis> question:  is it possible to 'refresh' the package list from scratch?  possibly just bad data in there.
[11:34] <J-_> SilentDis: That's what I usually do when there are not depending packages installed to install something, heh. Otherwise, i'm not sure
[11:35] <LinuxHelp> Um, how do I connect my UPS to my computer? I have plugged in the serial cable to /dev/ttyS0, now how do I communicate with it?
[11:35] <J-_> SilentDis: reload? or do you want the original repo's in there?
[11:36] <SilentDis> J-_:  total 'fresh' package list download, if possible.  I assume there's just bad data in my package list :P
[11:36] <LinuxHelp> SilentDis, thats what happens when you click reload, it reloads everything
[11:36] <J-_> Just reload, wouldn't the packages be maintained by the provider?
[11:37] <frogzoo> LinuxHelp: if there's only a windows app for the ups, try wine
[11:37] <SilentDis> LinuxHelp:  hmm... not sure what's wrong then.  let me do some more checking
[11:37] <LinuxHelp> SilentDis, and repos that are no longer available get removed
[11:37] <atomikulinux> Okay... I'm currently copying the contents of my linux partition to another partition with cp -ax
[11:38] <LinuxHelp> frogzoo, I was thinking like "NUT" ?
[11:38] <atomikulinux> I'm certain linux isnt just gonna "work" after being moved across so what do I have to reconfigue?
[11:39] <SilentDis> ahh, ok.  I tracked it back.  it appears I'm having a problem with package libpoppler1-qt.  I get this error - "Depends: libpoppler1 (=0.5.1-0ubuntu7) but 0.5.3-0ubntu1 is to be installed".  then it won't mark it and exits
[11:39] <LinuxHelp> atomikulinux, I move my files across all the time like that, I mean its really just /boot/grub/menu.lst and /etc/fstab that you have to reconfigure
[11:40] <LinuxHelp> atomikulinux, and your bootloader should be installed to the mbr if neccesary
[11:40] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[11:40] <atomikulinux> Yeah I was wondering about that
[11:40] <atomikulinux> the hard drive im copying linux over from is going to my destroyed
[11:40] <atomikulinux> Because its faulty... I cant remember whether GRUB is on that or not...
[11:40] <transgress> okay i'm still running dapper and when i do an apt-get upgrade it tells me totem is being held back.  so i do a dist-upgrade and it says the same thing.  is there something wrong here?

[11:41] <LinuxHelp> atomikulinux, I personally use the "sudo grub" command when I need to reinstall, but you're going to need to read the manual
[11:41] <SilentDis> atomikulinux:  sorry to interject, grub is installed to the MBR of the master HD, usually (/dev/hda)
[11:41] <atomikulinux> Hmmm
[11:41] <atomikulinux> So what is one to do :O lol
[11:43] <transgress> anyone that can help me force a package to update?
[11:44] <atomikulinux> Yeah okay it appears that GRUB is on the partition that i'm currently moving over... whats this about the MBR? how do I set that up to boot grub?
[11:44] <SilentDis> it appears there's a bad dependany on package libpoppler1-qt.  it won't accept libpoppler1 of a higher version than it has.  any way around this?
[11:45] <LinuxHelp> atomikulinux, I recommend that you copy your files, remove your bad hd, and then insert a live cd to install grub and update your config files
[11:47] <SilentDis> !libpoppler1-qt
[11:47] <ubotu> libpoppler1-qt: PDF rendering library (Qt 3 based shared library). In component main, is optional. Version 0.5.4-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 56 kB, installed size 156 kB

[11:49] <pip> I see nothing in /usr/src/

[11:50] <TheGino_Frank> hello all i want to know if 6.10 offers the same support as 6.06 Lts when it come to security or is edgy different and will have LTS soon?
[11:50] <atomikulinux> insert a live cd to install grub and update my config files? Hmm... is there an option or something?
[11:50] <polez> Hello
[11:50] <atomikulinux> I do have the special install CD btw... the one that offers OEM and text mode and such...
[11:51] <schwofler> hi, i have a somehow weird question, but how do i mount an internal floppy drive in ubuntu? (at least it doesn't seem to be automounted on the desktop like the cdrom-drive)
[11:51] <SilentDis> !floppy | schwofler
[11:51] <ubotu> schwofler: To mount floppy disks, see here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MakeFloppyDriveAvailableToEveryone
[11:51] <schwofler> ubotu, thanks man
[11:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks man - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:51] <Flannel> TheGino_Frank: Edgy isn't LTS, it still has security updates and such though.
[11:51] <SilentDis> *giggles*
[11:51] <atomikulinux> lol
[11:52] <Flannel> TheGino_Frank: it just won't be supported for as long as the LTS
[11:52] <atomikulinux> insert a live cd to install grub and update my config files? Hmm... is there an option or something?
[11:52] <Flannel> atomikulinux: you can install grub from the alternate CD (that's the one you have)
[11:52] <atomikulinux> Yeah
[11:52] <Flannel> !grub | atomikulinux, see the first link.
[11:52] <ubotu> atomikulinux, see the first link.: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[11:52] <atomikulinux> I have both :D
[11:52] <Flannel> well, that page covers both ;)
[11:53] <atomikulinux> Okay, cool. thanks.
[11:53] <SilentDis> Flannel:  you beat me to it.  i should sleep rofl
[11:53] <ztech> is there a dvd player for ubuntu that can play dvds? i cant play my braveheart dvd
[11:53] <atomikulinux> Although at least i know why when windows used to be on this machine windows would freeze up for 10 seconds randomly... its cause the hard drive was going...
[11:53] <Goyim> how many people here use ubuntu in a corporate environment
[11:53] <Goyim> as a server

[11:53] <atomikulinux> It happened the other day on linux ya see, the hard drive just stopped working... linux went into read only mode or something...
[11:53] <TheGino_Frank> Flannel, so 6.06 would be better then edgy right now i'm running edgy should i go for 6.06 or stay on edgy?
[11:54] <polez> I have installed Ubuntu 6.10 and I have a conceptronic wireless Card C54c with RT2500 chip but it doesn't work. I have followed the instructions from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/RalinkRT2500 put when I try with "sudo ifup ra0 " it says "No such device". Can anyone help me?
[11:55] <SilentDis> Goyim:  as a server environment, personally, i still run FreeBSD.  It seems to handle what I need it for (apache, php, mysql, samba file server) a little better.  might just be familiarity though.  Ubuntu is on my desktop :)
[11:55] <Flannel> TheGino_Frank: you'll probably want to stick with edgy.  Unless you don't want to upgrade for a few years (c. 2 per LTS).  Like, if you were planning on running Feisty when it comes out in april, etc, you'd stick with edgy, Feisty, G---, etc
[11:55] <Goyim> I need that stuff and a shoutcast server/dj setup
[11:55] <Flannel> !lamp | Goyim
[11:55] <atomikulinux> ahh okay it seems I can reinstall grub through the normal liveCD
[11:55] <ubotu> Goyim: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[11:55] <Goyim> want to stream the sirius locally for the bathroom
[11:55] <atomikulinux> BRB, rebooting computer and removing old hard drive.
[11:55] <THE_ROCK> im a Suse developer, ive heard they are inviting us to join Ubuntu ?
[11:56] <SilentDis> Goyim:  lol!  very cool idea :D
[11:56] <TheGino_Frank> Flannel, thanks
[11:56] <Flannel> Goyim: there's also icecast stuff (that's the Free implementation of shoutcast)
[11:56] <Goyim> shoutcast is free too
[11:56] <atomikulinux> lol remember who I am when I come back cause im gonna probably need more help XD cya in a few mins
[11:56] <trench-> hehehe...whatever happened to just running a speaker to the bathroom?
[11:56] <trench-> jk...nice idea :)
[11:56] <Goyim> i didnt have good luck running it on centos but im going to try it out on fedora and ubuntu

[11:56] <SilentDis> trench-:  that's SO redneck geek ;)
[11:57] <trench-> hehehe...no doubt
[11:57] <Goyim> trench-, speaker doesnt let you surf the web on the can
[11:57] <SilentDis> ROFLMAO!
[11:57] <trench-> hahaha...while showering even
[11:57] <trench-> go on then :)
[11:57] <trench-> i ain't mad at you
[11:57] <trench-> hehehehe
[11:57] <trench-> (what  a grammar)
[11:57] <SilentDis> oy, and I thought I was bad.  I got a touch screen computer in my kitchen to keep my recipies on, as well as let me surf epicurious lol
[11:57] <Goyim> yeah you never know I might be ircing from the can
[11:58] <Goyim> SilentDis, naw im just ill and spend a lot of time in there
[11:58] <SilentDis> hmmm... wonder if ubuntu will 'recognize' the touch screen from a Micros POS out-of-box....
[11:59] <asfalt> oh when i 1st got wireless, ircing from the can used to be the highlight of the can visitation
[11:59] <polez> I have installed Ubuntu 6.10 and I have a conceptronic wireless Card C54c with RT2500 chip but it doesn't work. I have followed the instructions from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/RalinkRT2500 put when I try with "sudo ifup ra0 " it says "No such device". Can anyone help me?
[11:59] <Goyim> i dont know about that one but ive put ubuntu on quite a few POS computers :))
[11:59] <trench-> hahahahaha
[11:59] <SilentDis> Goyim:  was it able to poll the touch screen as a pointing device right away?
[12:01] <Goyim> SilentDis, I apologise , by POS I meant piece of ... excrement
[12:02] <SilentDis> Goyim:  rofl these are close.  Point Of Sale is what I was referring to, though :)
[12:02] <Goyim> SilentDis, try out the live cd and see
[12:02] <Goyim> i dont mean that to be a smart ass
[12:03] <Goyim> im really curious to see, the default xorg conf has drivers for laptop pads in it so it SHOULD
[12:03] <SilentDis> Goyim:  lol only problem with that is there's all of 1 ide slot, and no extra power cords in the box.  would take a LOT of work to get that going.  they have the ability to boot from USB, so I was gonna drop a 'live install' to a USB drive, and see what kinda damage i could do that way :)
[12:03] <Lord_Wind> Hi All
[12:03] <Goyim> i wonder if someones posted a usb bootable ubuntu image anywhere
[12:03] <Lord_Wind> I need of help
[12:04] <Lord_Wind> with this
[12:04] <Lord_Wind> http://pastebin.ca/257469
[12:04] <SilentDis> Goyim:  I got 4 Micros touch-screen POS machines from work when they upgraded.  they were too expensive to throw away (corporations gotta recycle), and they couldn't 'give' them away (that would be theft).  so, they opened the dock doors, left them there, and made an announcement of "please help make them go away" :D
[12:04] <Lord_Wind> I cant understand how to make this mapping
[12:06] <SilentDis> Goyim:  decent little boxen, actually.  P2 and P3 processors, 64mb ram (easily upgradable), 60gb hard drives, beautiful touch screens that run at 1024x768 :)
[12:06] <jpolivera> how can I configure sound for SI7012 ?
[12:07] <crimsun> jpolivera: what's wrong?
[12:07] <Goyim> any way to d/c the touchscreens and use them elsewhere?
[12:07] <jpolivera> crimsun: I have no sound :(
[12:07] <SilentDis> Goyim:  don't think so.  custom cable that supplies power, vid, and mouse function to it :P
[12:07] <jpolivera> just upgraded to edgy to see if that helped
[12:07] <[Nige] > anoyone played with ebtables?
[12:07] <crimsun> jpolivera: pastebin ``amixer''  (see the topic)
[12:08] <jpolivera> yeah I know what it is, sec please
[12:08] <SilentDis> Goyim:  they're modular, but only to be replaced by another one, if you get my drift.  very 'closed' architecture
[12:09] <jpolivera> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/257482
[12:09] <Goyim> yeah I meant can yoo attach one to another box
[12:10] <Goyim> would be cool if it had an rca/dvi/usb setup
[12:10] <jpolivera> crimsun: its been working for two years, suddenly one apt-get upgrade broke it

[12:10] <albert> Hello, i can only view my top-left part of my desktop, and now my mouse can't move but my keyboard yes. What can i do?
[12:10] <Goyim> my buddy just showed me that
[12:10] <SilentDis> Goyim: yeah, wish it was that easy.  though seriously about calling up Micros and asking for a pinout... they'd laugh at me, more than likely.  these things are 'propriatary' and still in production in a LOT of places.
[12:11] <crimsun> jpolivera: ok, first things first: is your normal user in the audio group?
[12:11] <Goyim> well, on the sun proprietary trinintrons you can get an adaper

[12:12] <jpolivera> crimsun: yes
[12:12] <crimsun> jpolivera: ok, is sound audible when you unmute 'PCM' and raise it above %0 ? :)
[12:12] <jpolivera> crimsun: lol nope it isnt
[12:12] <SilentDis> Goyim:  these are 13-14" or so.  not bad for a restaurant order input deal :)
[12:12] <Goyim> plasma be damned I want a super crisp destop and lots of space

[12:12] <ubuntu> hi

[12:13] <crimsun> jpolivera: ok, is sound audible when you mute 'Headphone Jack Sense' ?
[12:13] <jpolivera> crimsun: it is plugged crrectly because I have a dual boot and just tested it on windows
[12:13] <SilentDis> Goyim: you bet.  1024x768x24bpp
[12:13] <Goyim> SilentDis, about the pinout, it never hurts to try
[12:13] <TrollAndProud> hmm, yast is sucking so bad, maybe I should switch to Ubuntu
[12:13] <jpolivera> crimsun: where can I see that?
[12:13] <crimsun> jpolivera: well, how did you unmute 'PCM' and raise its level?
[12:13] <SilentDis> Goyim:  check out the micros site (http://www.micros.com/), they're 1 under their current 'top of the line' POS
[12:13] <aka_druid_> TrollAndProud: yeah, do it man
[12:14] <jpolivera> crimsun: clicking on the icon on right top? maybe you didnt mean that ...
[12:14] <crimsun> jpolivera: pastebin your current ``amixer''

[12:32] <crimsun> Platyna: to what does "this" refer?
[12:32] <CorpseFeeder> I'll rephrase that - hibernate works (the computer shuts off), but X does not restart when it "wakes up" and I get the blank screen/flashing keyboard lights lock up.
[12:32] <dmc1> Hello
[12:32] <mats> Platyna: why cant you read about it on the ubuntu-webpage?

[12:33] <crimsun> Platyna: meaning you'd like to add a source package to the Ubuntu distribution? Have you asked in #ubuntu-motu?
[12:33] <Platyna> crimsun: No. And what is ubuntu-motu?
[12:33] <crimsun> jpolivera: amixer set 'Surround Jack Mode' 'Independent'

[12:34] <Platyna> crimsun: For packages, I underestand?

[12:35] <saimu0> it is in the fourm tho  ive used it.

[12:49] <adrap> Hello, with the default apache install in ubuntu 6.10, when I try to visit the website, my browser aks me to save the data in phtml file... How the fuck can I fix that ?
[12:49] <schwofler> georgeb, i already tried memtest. without error.
[12:49] <Otacon22> anyone can advise my about a program like gdesklets, but that not use too cpu?

[12:49] <adrap> And if I install phpsysinfo, it doesn't fucking work at all
[12:49] <Gumby> does anyone here know why the gnome menu sometimes takes 5 seconds to display after I click on the ubuntu icon in the taskbar?
[12:49] <Gumby> other times its instant.  seems strange
[12:49] <adrap> Really, ubuntu appears to be shit. And apache on Debian works like a charm. It isn't fucked up as in ubuntu
[12:50] <zOrK> adrap Pherhaps you're trying to view a .php file
[12:50] <georgeb> adrap: 1. please control your languge; 2. do you have php installed ?
[12:50] <adrap> No, php isn't installed
[12:50] <zOrK> ok, so ubuntu's isn't fool , you're!.
[12:50] <zOrK> sudo apt-cache search php|grep apache
[12:50] <zOrK> and take a look at it according to your settings
[12:51] <ThePub> adrap: ubuntu is based on debian and if debian fulfills your needs, why change?
[12:51] <zOrK> apache2, apache php5, php4, etc..
[12:51] <adrap> just installed phpsysinfo, and it stills tells me it wants to same the phtml file
[12:51] <adrap> samething with 127.0.0.1/phpsysinfo
[12:52] <georgeb> adrap: how did you install phpsysinfo ? package or "tar.gz" ?
[12:52] <zOrK> adrap you're an idiot.
[12:52] <Gumby> adrap: you need to install the apache php module.  until you do so and have apache configured properly to parse php files you will continue to get these "errors"
[12:52] <DreamerHxC> is there any problem if I do not have /etc/inittab in my system?
[12:52] <atomikulinux> hmm hang ona minute
[12:52] <adrap> I did apt-get install phpsysinfo and php was installed a s a dependency
[12:52] <atomikulinux> what was that link again?
[12:52] <atomikulinux> im a bit stuck
[12:52] <zOrK> adrap dpkg-reconfigure apache and see if it's loaded
[12:52] <Gumby> adrap: you need the apache php module, not just php
[12:52] <atomikulinux> oh wait
[12:52] <zOrK> if php module is loaded
[12:53] <zOrK> as I said
[12:53] <zOrK> sudo apt-cache search php|grep apache
[12:53] <umarmung> DreamerHxC: do you use edgy?
[12:53] <DreamerHxC> yes
[12:53] <zOrK> and install what's needed
[12:53] <stenetius> How do I enter runlevel 3 and then quit the X server? (I gonna install the NVidia drivers)
[12:53] <Gumby> adrap: apt-cache search php |grep apache as zOrK said and you will have the package you need to install.
[12:53] <Gumby> dont forget to restart apache
[12:53] <georgeb> adrap: did you restart apache after installing phpindo
[12:53] <umarmung> DreamerHxC: upstart doesn't use inittab, look in /etc/event.d
[12:53] <DreamerHxC> and I have a problem: I cannot enter graphic mode, because after login screen, my desktop gets freezed; this happens even with liveCD
[12:53] <ranman> sternetius: just go to tty1
[12:54] <stenetius> ranman: how?
[12:54] <Seigi> I seem to be having a problem installing Ubuntu.. Whenever I try it says "soft lockup detected on CPU#0" and then everything stops (which is logical with a soft lockup..). Does anyone have a clue on what I could do to fix this?
[12:54] <ranman> sternetius: press cntl + alt + f1
[12:54] <ranman> then login
[12:54] <umarmung> DreamerHxC: can you switch to a textconsole? ctrl+alt+f1
[12:54] <DreamerHxC> yes
[12:54] <DreamerHxC> and I can ctrl + alt + backspace
[12:54] <atomikulinux> yeah though
[12:54] <atomikulinux> who was it that gave me that link
[12:54] <umarmung> DreamerHxC: then check the logs in /var/log and ~/.xsession-errors
[12:54] <atomikulinux> "how to restore grub"
[12:55] <DreamerHxC> is it the same than /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
[12:55] <Gumby> DreamerHxC: switch to a text tty console and then login as user and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop  then install the driver and then do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[12:55] <Gumby> oops, sorry... my bad
[12:55] <Gumby> got two conversations mixed up I think
[12:56] <DreamerHxC> Gumby binary driver or ubuntu driver? (I have an ATI and I got the same problem with ATI and with NVIDIA)
[12:56] <YkraD`oFF> people i need a little help :/
[12:56] <Gumby> stenetius: ctrl+alt+f1, login as user, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[12:56] <YkraD`oFF> ive installed ubuntu on my laptop
[12:56] <georgeb> atomikulinux: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Restore_Grub
[12:56] <ranman> sternetius: are you still here?
[12:56] <atomikulinux> thanks
[12:56] <umarmung> DreamerHxC: no, xsession-errors protocols what happens after Xorg.0.log
[12:56] <atomikulinux> I think im having a bit of trouble
[12:56] <Gumby> DreamerHxC: forget what I said to you, I got two messages mixed up there for a sec
[12:56] <atomikulinux> Basically...
[12:56] <YkraD`oFF> I've installetd Ubuntu 6.10 on my HP Pavilion dv5000 and i need Driver for WLAN etc. someone could help me ? :/
[12:56] <ranman> gumby: i think sternetius can't figure out how to get out of text console
[12:57] <to4i> Hello everyone!
=== YkraD`oFF is now known as DarkY
[12:57] <ranman> whats your WLAN card?
[12:57] <DreamerHxC> Gumby ok but it may work for me too
[12:57] <atomikulinux> I mount / to where linux is installed... swap to a spare partition... but it says no root filesystem
=== DarkY is now known as DarkStorm
[12:57] <Gumby> ranman: well in that case,  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm retart
[12:57] <Gumby> :)
[12:57] <Gumby> restart too :)
[12:57] <stenetius> If I just go to Tty1 the X server keeps running, and the NVidia driver's installer likes that not.. How do I *quit* X?
[12:57] <atomikulinux> where to I mount /boot to?
[12:57] <Gumby> stenetius: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[12:57] <DarkStorm> and my laptop hung up when i woke him up from standy
[12:57] <DarkStorm> super <.<
[12:58] <Gumby> stenetius: it would be a good idea to log out of gnome first
[12:58] <ranman> stenetius: type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[12:58] <atomikulinux> also wheres the best place to mount this spare hard drive to?
[12:58] <DarkStorm> gone eating wil be back
[12:58] <atomikulinux> just for putting random files on it
=== DarkStorm is now known as DarkStorm2k7
[12:58] <ranman> but if you are trying to use the drivers from the nvidia site... you won't be happy
[12:58] <georgeb> atomikulinux: you should have somthing like /dev/hda1 mounted to /; /dev/hda2 mounted to /boot; /dev/hda3 mounted to /usr; /dev/hda4 swap
[12:59] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[12:59] <Gumby> atomikulinux: wherever you like really.  if its going to be accessed by only one user, yourself... you might want to put it in /home/username/mount_point
[12:59] <atomikulinux> Well then
[12:59] <ranman> hmm... mysql is not working *cries*
[12:59] <misc--> gday... I was just wondering, I want to setup virtual mail with postfix/mysql. I know that there is a howto on it but is there a web interface available for managing the virtual domains/users?
[12:59] <dmnd> what repository can i use to install E17?
[12:59] <atomikulinux> boot isnt mounted to anything atm
[12:59] <georgeb> atomikulinux: if you don't have a partition for /boot, one for /usr; etc then you don't need to mount something there
[12:59] <atomikulinux> I want boot on the linux parition
[12:59] <atomikulinux> oh
[12:59] <atomikulinux> okay
[12:59] <atomikulinux> I click next but it says "No root filesystem"
[12:59] <georgeb> atomikulinux: then in the menu just specify /dev/hda1 as /; /dev/hda2 as swap
[01:00] <thandavarayan> It will be interesting if some one point to E17 repos...
[01:00] <atomikulinux> hmm
[01:00] <georgeb> atomikulinux: oh.. I think that was a problem, let me check
[01:00] <unfun> Where can I get a good dvd burner program?

[01:06] <defrysk> to boldly go where baldies go
[01:07] <georgeb> atomikulinux: there is a bug in the installer that causes this "no root filesystem"; second method: sudo mkdir /mnt/temp; sudo mount /dev/hdxy (the path for your root partition) /mnt/temp; sudo grub-install /dev/hdx --root-directory=/mnt/temp/boot/grub

[01:24] <stylin> anyone know an .iso image burning prog that doesn't use cdrecord internally ?
[01:24] <CorpseFeeder> ok.. I worked out that the other CD-ROM is my hard disk. That is why it says it has 6.9Gb free. Now why is ubuntu calling it a CD drive and how do I fix this?

[01:56] <P2K> Does this mean i need to install vid drivers to be able to play WoW etc ? libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
[01:56] <P2K> direct rendering: Yes
[01:57] <cello_rasp> thanks iwkse
[01:57] <Seveas> tengil, upgrading them probably needs extra packages, try apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:58] <iwkse> P2K: do you an an intel i180 card?
[01:58] <tengil> Seveas: got the same as with upgrade
[01:58] <Seveas> tengil, interesting...
[01:58] <CoRnJuLiOx> how do i run a .bin file?
[01:58] <Seveas> tengil, apt-get dist-upgrade -o"Debug::PkgProblemResolver=true"
[01:58] <P2K> iwkse: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc R480 [Radeon X850Pro] 
[01:58] <CoRnJuLiOx> i've tried sh, run, and ./ but none work...
[01:58] <Seveas> tengil, and pastebin the output
[01:59] <iwkse> P2K: i get the same error on a intel i810..
[01:59] <DarkStorm2k7> okay i tried to add a network @ klan @ Seveas
[01:59] <Seveas> CoRnJuLiOx, chmod +x bla.bin and then ./bla.bin
[01:59] <DarkStorm2k7> "network could not by actived at wpa_suppliant konfiguration"
[01:59] <P2K> hehe, odd
[01:59] <DarkStorm2k7> i must start a wpa supllicant
[01:59] <DarkStorm2k7> but which driver
[01:59] <DarkStorm2k7> k ipw...
[02:00] <DarkStorm2k7> found my own answer
[02:00] <DarkStorm2k7> ^^
[02:00] <P2K> im reluctant to install propriety drivers, everytime i try to do it, end with me re-installing edgy lol
[02:00] <P2K> *proprietary
[02:00] <iwkse> P2K: i still haven't search for solution..
[02:01] <Seveas> DarkStorm2k7, if you need wpa, use network-manager
[02:01] <Seveas> it's great at handling wpa
[02:01] <P2K> ok, ty :)
[02:02] <tengil> Seveas: its answering in swedish now. will that be a problem?
[02:02] <Seveas> tengil, err, yes
[02:02] <tengil> thought so
[02:02] <Seveas> tengil, LC_ALL=C apt-get dist-upgrade -o"Debug::PkgProblemResolver=true"
[02:02] <tengil> im trying to get it switched back to english
[02:03] <Seveas> tengil, prepending 'LC_ALL=C' will do that for that command only, which is useful

[02:10] <tengil> thanks
[02:10] <Tattj> also, it doesn't boot from HD
[02:10] <Momal> Seveas: installing mysql 5.0 with apt-get it will remove 4.1... will it auto transfer my curent databases? or doi need to back up then manually
[02:10] <CoRnJuLiOx> anyone know how to add desktop icons in xfce?
[02:10] <iwkse> Tattj: mmh...how do you install it? CD?
[02:10] <Tattj> When I  try to boot from my hard drive, the screen goes blank and freezes
[02:10] <jokoon> I haven't tested it yet, but are MKV files (matroska container thing) working on ubuntu with multiverse or other thing I activated ?
[02:11] <Tattj> I installed it with a cd
[02:11] <DarkY> Seveas you dont talk german... do u?
[02:11] <iwkse> Tattj: you're able to use it live?

[02:12] <Zlax> hi
[02:12] <Seveas> Momal, it will sit right next to 4.1 and not migrate data
[02:12] <tengil> Seveas: thanks
[02:13] <Seveas> Momal, you can also just stay with 4.1 and pastebin your configuration :)
[02:13] <Momal> Seveas: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33905/ | I posted it before you might have missed it :p

[02:35] <Efros2> I have a ntfs partition marked for checking in windows which is now history, but I need to access osome files before I reformat it, what is the syntax for a force mount
[02:36] <CoRnJuLiOx> ok, i'm looking to make a partition bigger, does ubuntu come w/any partition managing software?
[02:36] <Seveas> CoRnJuLiOx, gparted/kparted
[02:36] <ThePub> parted ftw
[02:36] <finalbeta> CoRnJuLiOx, not that I know of, but make sure you take backups, because those things are doomed to go wrong.
[02:37] <atomikulinux> Okay looks like grub is installed... Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd0) (hd0)1+15 p (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2

I have FC5 on it now, but I prefer ubuntu, I find apt much faster than yum, and there are a few other things that FC5 isn't doing for me.  I heard somewhere that there isn't Ubuntu support for the Cell processor yet, is that true?
[02:37] <atomikulinux> BRB, lets hope this works...
[02:37] <Rprp> Hi, how can i configure my drivers? If i play a game itcrashes after 5 minutes :/
[02:38] <Seveas> bobbobowitz, your fc5 also probably doesn't support the cell processor and just rund on the ppc core it has
[02:38] <Seveas> ubuntu would do the same
[02:38] <bobbobowitz> when I boot FC5, and see the boot-up, I see 2 big penguins, and 6 small ones that say SPU
[02:39] <bobbobowitz> I googled SPU, and it said it was Symetric Processing Unit or something, and that is what the cell is
[02:39] <bobbobowitz> or is made up of
[02:39] <Efros2> I can mount the drive but I get The folder contents could not be displayed.You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "hde1".

[02:40] <stenetius> E: Broken packages
[02:40] <bobbobowitz> I think the issue might be that FC5 has a special way to install, you need a kboot file or something, it isn't a standard boot, I'll find the directions, if anyone wants.....
[02:41] <travkin> stenetius, check ur repos
[02:41] <travkin> and apt-get update

[02:47] <atomikulinux> mats: Hmm?
[02:48] <CoRnJuLiOx> Zlax: dont you need a router for NAT?
[02:48] <bobbobowitz> I've never heard of this game, but since there is a linux version, I don't know.  Is your computer in a cooled place?  I don't think it is the drivers
[02:48] <P2K> gazedo: what app are you having the issue with ?
[02:48] <TheGino_Frank> d/l a program that is script dont know how to install right way what are the steps
[02:48] <gazedo> all sound applications
[02:48] <mats> atomikulinux: ill try too google now.. :o havnt had this problem before
[02:48] <P2K> oh
[02:48] <trench-> check levels in alsamixer
[02:48] <bobbobowitz> do other games work fine?
[02:48] <Rprp> bobbobowitz: yes,m its cooled and it works fine on windows.
[02:48] <P2K> what he said :p
[02:49] <Rprp> Dunno, i dont have installed other games yet
[02:49] <Rprp> And, by other users on linux it works fine :/
[02:49] <gazedo> i have, i have looked up all the fixes that i could find that are on the internet and i saw that it said it couldn't be fixed
[02:49] <Tattj> gah, same problem again
[02:49] <bobbobowitz> it might be the linux build, but I'm not sure.  It could be that the other users have a different setup.
[02:50] <Tattj> GRUB loads, I choose my linux -> black screen with flickering white bar @ left top corner
[02:50] <gazedo> tattj, sounds like xserver error
[02:50] <Rprp> hmmm
[02:51] <bobbobowitz> As in, the linux build is fine for others, because their hardware is supported.  You might have something weird or different in there that is crashing the game.
=== yama is now known as yama_away
[02:51] <bobbobowitz> But I don't know for sure since I don't know this game.
[02:51] <deusjevoo> !seen janchi
[02:51] <ubotu> I last saw Janchi (i=hidden-u@a80-127-157-130.adsl.xs4all.nl) 2d 1h 46m 52s ago, quiting: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)
[02:52] <Rprp> Hmmmm ;/
[02:52] <bobbobowitz> I'd try another native linux game first, and if it has issues, than I'd think it could be your drivers.
[02:52] <Tattj> gazedo, are there any ways to fix this?
[02:52] <cosmodad> hi -- can anyone recommend an WAV-to-MP3 encoder under Ubuntu?
[02:52] <cosmodad> just encoding, no ripping
[02:52] <KDan> cosmodad: lame
[02:52] <cosmodad> and GUI, sorry
[02:52] <KDan> oh
[02:53] <mats> atomikulinux: http://www.uclibc.org/FAQ.html#job_control ,
[02:53] <KDan> why gui?
[02:53] <Rprp> But, how can i make the CONFIGURE 'good' ?
[02:53] <nolimitsoya> cosmodad, cant soudjuicer use a wav for input?
[02:53] <atomikulinux> mats:  i think i may have fixed it already
[02:53] <atomikulinux> lemme check that first
[02:53] <gazedo> tattj, have u customized your xorg.conf at all?
[02:54] <atomikulinux> brb
[02:54] <saimu0> problem with my resolutin can anyone help?
[02:54] <Zlax> sry wasnt here for the moment
[02:54] <cosmodad> nolimitsoya: I can't manage to do that
[02:54] <nolimitsoya> cosmodad, ok, just a thought. never used soundjuicer myself :)
[02:54] <Tattj> gazedo, no. I can't because my Ubuntu does not load :/
[02:54] <Zlax> is it possible to do nat with one network card
[02:54] <bobbobowitz> What do you mean the CONFIGURE?  It might be setup fine for your hardware, but the game might not like your hardware or something
[02:54] <cosmodad> KDan: for the sake of not-doing console work
[02:54] <cosmodad> nolimitsoya: me neither, just did a quick check
[02:54] <raskar> salute
[02:55] <nolimitsoya> cosmodad, i think youll find using the console a lot less hassle than many gui apps. why this consolofobia?
[02:55] <KDan> cosmodad: but... why? ;-)
[02:55] <r_rehashed> how do I access the wine repositories for edgy (amd64) ?
[02:55] <KDan> cosmodad: ripping is one of the few tasks which is significantly easier on the console than with a gui
[02:55] <saimu0> Problem with SCREEN RES and VIDEOCARD  can anyone help ?
[02:55] <KDan> i mean encoding
[02:55] <nolimitsoya> r_rehashed, wine is already in the repos
[02:55] <nolimitsoya> !wine | r_rehashed
[02:55] <ubotu> r_rehashed: wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[02:56] <nolimitsoya> hm... ok,well, i hoped it would tell you what repo,...
[02:56] <Zlax> who has problems with games
[02:56] <r_rehashed> but isn't that an outdated version?
[02:56] <KDan> one command line call vs. 5 gazillion clicks --- the command line wins every time and scales up with the number of tracks you're trying to encode
[02:56] <mats> cedega for games, wine for programs
[02:56] <nolimitsoya> r_rehashed, if so id think itll be backported pretty soon anyway
[02:56] <r_rehashed> alright
[02:57] <Zlax> mats: u r right
[02:57] <jhasse> How can i turn off that the entries of my windows in the gnome-panel have drag and drop?
[02:57] <dee> hello
[02:57] <mats> dee: ;)
[02:57] <dee> could someone tell me how to start compiz?
[02:57] <cosmodad> KDan, nolimitsoya: I'm a console type of guy myself but adding bunch of switches via console isn't what I call comfort
[02:57] <r_rehashed> can I help in backporting applcations?
[02:57] <DarkY> Seveas: my eth1 is now totally disappered no way to geht back..
[02:57] <cosmodad> KDan, nolimitsoya: I find it much nicer if I just enter a bunch of fields and hit go
[02:58] <nolimitsoya> cosmodad, you could always make a conf with your preffered settings as default
[02:58] <Zlax> nat with 1 network card??????
[02:58] <savvas> How can i encrypt files with right-click? there was a package with gnupg if i'm not wrong..
[02:58] <DarkY> okay if he is busy... :/
[02:58] <DarkY> people ive got an centrio3 with 3945abg INTEL WLAN.... ive just found networks with kwlan and no the eth1 is disappered... what should i do?
[02:58] <mats> Zlax: No one knows, i belive. I know it works nice with 2 cards :p
[02:58] <r_rehashed> I mean can I download the source code of an application and compile it for my arch. and then submit it..
[02:58] <cosmodad> nolimitsoya: yeah I could...
[02:59] <KDan> cosmodad: that is really the easiest option... set up once and run forever...
[02:59] <cosmodad> nolimitsoya: and I probably will since there doesn't seem to be a Ubuntu-equivalent to CDex
[02:59] <KDan> i think all the equivalents also do ripping
[02:59] <KDan> there's certainly some rippers out there
[02:59] <KDan> (with guis)
[02:59] <cosmodad> KDan: but I've found non which does not rely on ripping
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[02:59] <mats> Zlax: why use nat with one card?
[03:00] <cosmodad> KDan: they all require ripping sic
[03:00] <gazedo> tattj, i know that there is an answer but i can't find it right now, if i find it tonight i'll get bak to u, but keep asking
[03:00] <Tattj> gazedo thank you :)
[03:01] <Zlax> mats: can we talk in private its to crowded here?
[03:01] <mats> Zlax: off cource

[03:05] <stenetius> My command is:

[03:05] <KDan> hmm. I've run a bunch of find commands and for some reason they've all hung.. now i can't even kill them with kill -9... any thoughts on how to exterminate them more thoroughly?
[03:05] <atomikulinux> Also, my swap partition has moved. But I dont know how to tell ubuntu to use this new swap partition from now on...
[03:06] <KDan> (they're using up precious 'screen' screens on my console, the bastards)

[03:09] <stenetius> dee, what others? The official Ubuntu stuff?
[03:10] <nolimitsoya> KDan, i guess it could be done remotely with 'ifconfig down && ifconfig up'
[03:10] <dee> stenetius: just use the official Ubuntu stuff. no beerorkid or anything else.
[03:10] <anton_> charlotte: what exactly do you want to do?
=== CoRnJuLiOx_ is now known as CoRnJuLiOx

[03:11] <Rarj> dee, how do I check ?
[03:11] <atomikulinux> how do I get the UUID of a hard drive?
[03:11] <anton_> charlotte: with ssh, you are on the remote server, as if you had a terminal running on it directly
[03:11] <KDan> charlotte: i'm not aware of such a way, but what you could do is forward an NFS connection through ssh
[03:11] <Arcad3> what command shall i use to see my ip in ubuntu?
[03:11] <stenetius> dee, what command?
[03:12] <dee> Rarj: just open the package management and lok for it. :)
[03:12] <anton_> Arcad3: ipconfig

[03:21] <Rarj> dee, no
[03:21] <Rarj> cherubiel, dapper
[03:21] <anton_> burwaco: if you really want information, try lshw as root :)
[03:21] <cherubiel> Rarj: taht version is in edgy
[03:21] <burwaco> dee, it shows up there, but does that mean it works fine too ?
[03:21] <dee> Rarj: strange... he package is there. I can install it. :)
[03:21] <cherubiel> !upgrade | Rarj
[03:21] <ubotu> Rarj: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:22] <atomikulinux> okay thanks mats
[03:22] <Rarj> :)
[03:22] <mats> atomikulinux: any time
[03:22] <dee> burwaco: I do not know what you use for hardware. If you have a clear screen it might work well. ;)
[03:22] <Zylche> cherubiel, I can see no way that bot can be abused.
[03:22] <forsaker> hi :)
[03:22] <anton_> quick question for edgy eft users: how often do you get an upgrade? i'm beginning to suspect something may be broken with my installation.
[03:23] <forsaker> I'm trying setting up my pc for joining a vpn, but i'm getting this error... any idea?
[03:23] <forsaker> Sat Nov 25 15:20:43 2006 TUN/TAP device tun0 opened
[03:23] <forsaker> Sat Nov 25 15:20:43 2006 ifconfig tun0 10.0.2.5 pointopoint 255.255.255.0 mtu 1500
[03:23] <forsaker> SIOCSIFDSTADDR: Argomento non valido
[03:23] <forsaker> Sat Nov 25 15:20:43 2006 Linux ifconfig failed: shell command exited with error status: 1
[03:23] <dee> anton_: hm, may be.
[03:23] <dee> maybe I should try another install method.
[03:23] <forsaker> where "Argomento non valido" stands for "invalid argument" :D
[03:24] <anton_> forsaker: that looks like you're trying to do something which requires root rights without being root
[03:24] <forsaker> anton_, unfortunatly I'm root :\
[03:24] <burwaco> dee, well I've been using ubuntu for a while now, and I think there's still some performance missing, I'd like to have all the latest drivers and things enabled that my hardware is suited for. does a pentium m support hypertreading ? I guess not...
[03:25] <Rarj> cherubiel, it says system is upto date
[03:25] <Rarj> but cat /etc/issue says 6.06
[03:25] <anton_> forsaker: that's the only suggestion i have :( i've never used a vpn :(
[03:25] <cherubiel> Rarj: you're on dapper, that version is for edgy
[03:25] <cherubiel> !edgy
[03:25] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[03:25] <ryanakca> ok, with this file in '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled', why doesn't base.rkavanagh.homelinux.org display /var/www/htdocs/base, and why does rkavanagh.homelinux.org display /var/www/htdocs? rkavanagh.homelinux.org/~ryan/000-default

[03:29] <charlotte> i found the ssh mount. It's worth taking a look at, as it's really handy if you work a lot on a remote sytem and want to interact with your own
[03:29] <charlotte> http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/28/how-to-mount-a-remote-ssh-filesystem-using-sshfs/
[03:29] <dee> so, i'm away. bye.
[03:29] <anton_> charlotte: i'm still unsure what you mean. at home i use ssh a lot, cos i'm too lazy to get up and go to my server :)
[03:29] <burwaco> what's a good alternative for3Dmark in linux/gnu ?
[03:30] <cda> I'm trying to get compiz to work and everything is fine but the window boarders are gone and I can't get them back...how do I fix this?
[03:30] <charlotte> anton_, it mounts an entire filesystem of a remote machine to a mountpoint of your local machine
[03:30] <anton_> oh, cool :) nfs tunneling through ssh :)
[03:30] <cherubiel> charlotte: the fish protocol ?
[03:30] <highneko> !compiz | cda

[03:30] <charlotte> and you can acces it directly as if it were part of your own machine
[03:31] <charlotte> cherubiel, no, fuse
[03:31] <burwaco> fuse ?
[03:31] <anton_> charlotte: what's the command? :)
[03:31] <cda> highneko: I have not found the issue listed at that site
[03:32] <highneko> cda: #ubuntu-xgl ?

[03:32] <Rprp> ok thnx
[03:33] <mats> anton_: ssh to the box back home ;)
[03:33] <charlotte> it works really well if e.g.  you want to edit a remote file with a local editor, or run a remote file with a local program in general
[03:33] <anton_> mats: is unfortunately switched off atm :(
[03:34] <mats> anton_: :-/
[03:34] <cherubiel> anton_: etherwake? :P
[03:34] <charlotte> or other way round, alltough in practice this is rarer
[03:34] <anton_> mats: though i should try out some vpn stuff :)
[03:34] <anton_> cherubiel: and the network is also switched off...
[03:35] <cherubiel> anton_: would've been fun :P

[03:36] <anton_> mats: okay :)
[03:36] <Nitro> hi
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> what do i need to decode flac using amarok?
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> amarok-xine is installed
[03:36] <nolimitsoya> libxine-extracodecs?
[03:36] <atomikulinux> GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[03:37] <lombriz> gg
[03:37] <atomikulinux> Okay, the hard drive has changed and grubs "root" is set to the wrong drive
[03:37] <atomikulinux> How do I reconfigure this
[03:37] <c_lisp> hi I tried toupdate my video driver now I can't get my xserver to work at all I tried to go back but I guess im doing something wrong can somebody help me?
[03:37] <anton_> atomikulinux: have you got a live cd?
[03:37] <c_lisp> i have beryl install to if that helps
[03:37] <atomikulinux> im on the livecd now
[03:37] <atomikulinux> I cant boot into ubuntu cause grub is telling it to do all sorts of crap
[03:38] <atomikulinux> it crashes me to the debian busybox
[03:38] <anton_> then just open up /boot/grub/menu.lst and edit it :)
[03:38] <FeIix> I have an amd mobile with its multiplier unlocked. Cpu scaling works nice in windows. How do I get it to work just as nice in ubuntu?
[03:38] <nickb> hello - I need to set my TOPDIR variable, but it doesnt currently exist on my system.  Do I just add it to /etc/environment?
[03:39] <c_lisp> :(
[03:40] <cherubiel> c_lisp: got the drivers working OK ?
[03:40] <Willa> is there like a VB type of deal
[03:40] <Willa> to make custom little programs?
[03:40] <c_lisp> naw x crashes on start up
[03:40] <charlotte> about 20% of the time my edgy box hangs on the very start of the boot splash. Is there any way I can make it more verbose, or disable the splash alltogher?
[03:41] <cherubiel> c_lisp: start with /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:41] <charlotte> (the edgy splash artwork is to ugly to look at anyway)
[03:41] <anton_> c_lisp you can open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and replace the driver with your old one
[03:41] <atomikulinux> kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hdb1 ro quiet
[03:41] <atomikulinux> Okay this is in my menu.lst (or whatever its called)
[03:41] <atomikulinux> what should root normaly be?
[03:41] <str4`> you tell me
[03:41] <c_lisp> how do I do that?
[03:41] <cherubiel> charlotte: you can remove te "splash" word in menu.lst
[03:41] <c_lisp> replacing that is
[03:41] <charlotte> thanks cherubiel
[03:41] <cherubiel> c_lisp: nope, its the log - pastebin it
[03:42] <anton_> atomikulinux: hdb1 looks unusual. are you sure it's the second harddrive?
[03:42] <atomikulinux> hmm
[03:42] <atomikulinux> basicaly....
[03:42] <atomikulinux> Where is it that defines the swap partition?
[03:42] <atomikulinux> My swap partition has moved as well ya see....
[03:42] <cherubiel> c_lisp: always use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:42] <charlotte> then there is this other thing on my dapper box, actualy, my bf's box. How should playing a normal dvd work?
[03:43] <anton_> atomikulinux: what does cat /proc/partitions say?
[03:43] <cherubiel> atomikulinux: fdisk -l /dev/hdx
[03:43] <atomikulinux> Well
[03:43] <atomikulinux> I'm on the liveCD atm
[03:43] <Morrissey> hey, I kind of !offtopic question, but I have a 2.2 mhz Pentium 4 with 2x256mb RAM. And using XGL my computer's kinda slow (Not the 3d effects thought). Would buying a 1gb RAM chip, and replace it with one of the 256 one improve my KDE envioriemnt?
[03:43] <mats> cherubiel: by installing a lot of libs :p
[03:43] <atomikulinux> fdisk -l /dev/hdx returns nothing.
[03:43] <anton_> atomikulinux: /proc/partitions will still contain information to every mass storage medium on the computer :)
[03:44] <c_lisp> i think when Installed it it removed my older driver
[03:44] <cherubiel> atomikulinux: replace x with the drive letter
[03:44] <cherubiel> atomikulinux: a or b
[03:44] <atomikulinux> Oh
[03:44] <atomikulinux> Cannot open /dev/hda
[03:44] <atomikulinux> note that im on the live
[03:44] <cherubiel> c_lisp: it was working? you upgraded to edgy?

[03:44] <cherubiel> atomikulinux: sudo
[03:44] <atomikulinux> k
[03:44] <cherubiel> atomikulinux: you need root perms
[03:44] <c_lisp> im use edgy

[03:45] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[03:45] <charlotte> atomikulinux, if you are doing a lot of sudos in a terminal and it gets  annoying you keep forgetting fo sudo, try a sudo -i first. that will make your whole terminal run in 'sudo mode'
[03:45] <anton_> atomikulinux: so you have one partition on the first harddrive
[03:45] <c_lisp> I reinstall linux didn't upgrade
[03:45] <cherubiel> Morrissey: you need a good graphic subsys
[03:45] <c_lisp> so i started off on edgy
[03:46] <c_lisp> and it was working on it
[03:46] <anton_> c_lisp: which driver is it, btw?
[03:46] <KnowledgEngi> timidity do not play the midi file
[03:46] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/TnY7ny63.html

[03:46] <cherubiel> KnowledgEngi: whats the error?
[03:47] <cherubiel> Morrissey: got the drivers properly installed?
[03:47] <anton_> atomikulinux: let's see it! cat /proc/partitions
[03:47] <Morrissey> cherubiel, yes, actually get over 200 frames pr second with AIXGL
[03:47] <super> i destroyed my pc by installing nvidia drivers
[03:47] <cherubiel> Morrissey: :O
[03:47] <Morrissey> cherubiel, and glxgears gives me over 2000, so
[03:47] <anton_> KnowledgEngi: is timidity installed correctly? does it try to play the file?
[03:47] <Dragonfire1> Hi have a ? on desktops to change  workspace. How can you make difffernet 4 desktops have different backgrounds?
[03:47] <Morrissey> cherubiel, its just normal browsing and stuff thats slow
[03:47] <nickb> hello - I need to set my TOPDIR variable, but it doesnt currently exist on my system.  I have tried adding it to /etc/environmnet but that doesnt help
[03:48] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/w76rYu27.html
[03:48] <KnowledgEngi> cherubiel, look at down page
[03:48] <Dragonfire1> I can add others but they are all the same
[03:48] <KnowledgEngi> there is the output
[03:48] <atomikulinux> anton_: sec
[03:48] <KnowledgEngi> after reboot timidity do not play
[03:48] <atomikulinux> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33918/
[03:48] <KnowledgEngi> befor the boot timidityas played the file.mid
[03:49] <c_lisp> I got it up and running now just running like crap see what I have to configure
[03:49] <c_lisp> thanks guys
[03:49] <cherubiel> KnowledgEngi: does /home/user/soundfonts/Unison.sf2 exist ?
[03:49] <KnowledgEngi> user@ubuntu:~$ ls /home/user/soundfonts/
[03:49] <KnowledgEngi> Unison.sf2
[03:49] <KnowledgEngi> yes
[03:49] <KnowledgEngi> but before i has the same error
[03:50] <KnowledgEngi> but timidity has played
[03:50] <cherubiel> KnowledgEngi: perms?
[03:50] <KnowledgEngi> why know do not play
[03:50] <charlotte> removing splash from grub.lst removed the splace screen allright, but it didn't make it more verbose.... remove quiet too?
[03:50] <cherubiel> charlotte: yep, go for it ; backup your old lst file.
[03:51] <KnowledgEngi> user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l soundfonts/Unison.sf2

[03:51] <charlotte> i might be a linux noob, but I allways back up everything :D
[03:51] <atomikulinux> argh
[03:51] <cherubiel> charlotte: good one :)
[03:51] <KnowledgEngi> before rebooting timidity play good without load the soundfont
[03:51] <anton_> atomikulinux: /dev/hdb1 can't be right as your root partition. there's nothing there
[03:51] <atomikulinux> yeah
[03:51] <atomikulinux> hda1 is where its all at
[03:51] <atomikulinux> shall I change root to hda1 ?
[03:52] <KnowledgEngi> cherubiel,
[03:52] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:52] <anton_> atomikulinux: would be a good idea :)
[03:52] <atomikulinux> I think my menu.lst is fixed
[03:52] <atomikulinux> Shall I try rebooting?
[03:52] <anton_> can you post it first?
[03:52] <atomikulinux> Oh also... I think I need to reconfigue "fstab"
[03:52] <super> theres a linux  talk team speak server
[03:52] <atomikulinux> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33919/
[03:53] <super> type linux talk and you can go there to get help from people with linux over teamspeak
[03:53] <LjL> atomikulinux: root is still hdb1 there
[03:54] <atomikulinux> oh?
[03:54] <anton_> atomikulinux: it's okay for the recovery mode entry
[03:54] <atomikulinux> oh thats right I only changed it for the memtest one
[03:54] <KnowledgEngi> :(
[03:54] <atomikulinux> or w/e it is
[03:54] <atomikulinux> okay its fixed
[03:55] <atomikulinux> Now what?
[03:55] <anton_> atomikulinux what does /etc/fstab say?
[03:55] <dmnd> does anyone know if the xfce shipped with 6.10 has Composite support enabled?
[03:55] <atomikulinux> the /etc/fstab on the hda1 drive?
[03:55] <charlotte> great, this was exactly what I wanted. Now when it hangs I can at least figure out *where* it hangs
[03:55] <atomikulinux> or the /etc/fstab that the livecd has created
[03:55] <anton_> atomikulinux: exactly :)
[03:55] <atomikulinux> the first one?
[03:56] <Dragonfire1> I guess you can't have different warkspaces with different backgrounds
[03:56] <anton_> atomikulinux: on /dev/hda1 (you may need to mount it first)
[03:56] <LjL> atomikulinux: your real fstab. yes, the one on the HD
[03:56] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:56] <LammiePie> Hi, can anyone tell me how to remove the yellow tool tip boxes in GNOME Ubuntu. Like when you hover over the time it says "click to check appoinments" those things. they are annoying me!
[03:56] <atomikulinux> I have hda1 mounted on /home/ubuntu/omg/ XD
[03:56] <cherubiel> Dragonfire1: kde?
[03:57] <Dragonfire1> any of you guy's know of Saturday talk radio shows for LInux on the net
[03:57] <anton_> atomikulinux: then let's see cat /home/ubuntu/omg/etc/fstab :)

[04:01] <ubuntu_> hi all, I was curious to see if I had a 64 bit computer (wasnt sure), so I popped in the 64 bit ubuntu live cd.  It works just6 fine.  Does this mean I have a 64 bit machine or am I being tricked?
[04:01] <anton_> ubuntu_: that means you have a 64-bit machine :)
[04:01] <ubuntu_> excellent
[04:02] <atomikulinux> back
[04:02] <cherubiel> dmnd: your xorg.conf should have a section named "Extensions" with an entry like     Option "Composite" "Enable"
[04:02] <LjL> c_lisp: "xdpyinfo" for information on your graphics mode
[04:02] <defrysk> c_lisp, cat /etc/X11xorg.xonf | grep DefaultDepth

[04:02] <atomikulinux> okay then
[04:02] <atomikulinux> How shall I fix my fstab?
[04:02] <anton_> atomikulinux: can you paste it?

[04:02] <LjL> hamdinp: ?
[04:03] <atomikulinux> in fact... that fstab seems okay
[04:03] <atomikulinux> not sure if the UUIDs are correct though
[04:03] <LjL> !uuid | atomikulinux
[04:03] <ubotu> atomikulinux: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid" (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
[04:03] <dmnd> cherubiel: i have them, but i dont know how to check in xfce if there anything needs to be done
[04:03] <atomikulinux> Okay cool. Thanks LjL. I'll get the list of UUIDs and match them up to the fstab
[04:03] <atomikulinux> 2 mins
[04:03] <cherubiel> ubuntu_: try this - file /usr/bin/gcc
[04:04] <hamdinp> this is turkish linux distro on turkish television
[04:04] <dmnd> cherubiel: i lost my transparant terminals with the composite extension turned on.. strange enough.. :)
[04:04] <atomikulinux> Hmm can I just run "partman-target"?
[04:04] <robbbb> morning all
[04:04] <dmnd> cherubiel: so where can i find the properties for transparancy in xfce?
[04:05] <cherubiel> dmnd: xfcm should be built with --enable-compositor
[04:05] <atomikulinux> I'm not sure what that thing is telling me to do...
[04:05] <cherubiel> dmnd: did you install fro mthe binaries?
[04:05] <robbbb> anybody been able to get a perc2 controller working in edgy / dapper?
[04:05] <atomikulinux> lol nevermind
[04:05] <anton_> atomikulinux: if the uuids are okay, just try to reboot :)
[04:05] <robbbb> i read somewhere that support has been removed? is so that is LAME
[04:05] <atomikulinux> Yeah the uuids are okay
[04:06] <atomikulinux> BRB gonna reboot
[04:06] <dmnd> cherubiel: yes, from the binaries
[04:06] <cherubiel> dmnd: quite possible composites aren't enalbed.
[04:06] <dmnd> cherubiel: do you know how i can check that?
[04:06] <cherubiel> dmnd: not sure, try #xfce
[04:06] <robbbb> anyone know of another good linux server dist?
[04:07] <super> no idea
[04:07] <dmnd> cherubiel: ok. :)
[04:07] <super> i use linux for the purposes of looking at tites and playing quake
[04:07] <kandinski> soundray: thanks for the instructions. As I say, the problem is there is a conflict with the packages.
[04:07] <njal_> robbb: Why not use dapper?
[04:08] <anton_> do i want to know what 'tites' means?

[04:08] <nickb> Hi guss, sorry to keep bugging the channel, but I cant find any info on setting the TOPDIR variable
[04:08] <renjith171> i cannot play avi files though i installed w32codecs package. what should i do?
[04:08] <ADminS> how i can check if my laptop mic working or not
[04:08] <c_lisp> what all I need to install for nvidia in termnial I can't use synapics :/?
[04:08] <anton_> renjith171 what are you trying to play them with?
[04:09] <njal_> renjith171: VLC player playes EVERYTHING
[04:09] <super> yeah anton i need to know this too
[04:09] <LadyNikon> VLC ++
[04:09] <robbbb> anyone understand the install process here?
[04:09] <diskus> VLC

[04:09] <diskus> VLC's ui is awfull
[04:09] <renjith171> anton_: totem
[04:09] <super> anton i messed up my laptop triying to install and just reinstalled ubuntu
[04:09] <cherubiel> renjith171: try mplayer
[04:09] <njal_> diskus: Aye, but for what it does, i can live with an ugly GUI
[04:09] <LadyNikon> diskus: i never had a problem with it
[04:09] <renjith171> its not there in the repositories
[04:10] <cherubiel> renjith171: btw, *what* the problem? video/audio sync issue?
[04:10] <njal_> renjith171: Have u got universe and multiverse?
[04:10] <cherubiel> !info mplayer
[04:10] <ubotu> mplayer: The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux. In component multiverse, is extra. Version 2:0.99+1.0pre8-0ubuntu8 (edgy), package size 3461 kB, installed size 8624 kB
[04:10] <anton_> rinjith171: the codec package works for players such as mplayer and those which use xine as a back-end. i think the version of totem you get with eft doesn't use xine as the backend, so you have to install a different version
[04:10] <diskus> LadyNikon: well I don't like ui, otherwise VLC is awesome piece of software
[04:10] <cherubiel> renjith171: multiverse

[04:12] <Dreamglider> anton_,  what do i do now ?
[04:12] <anton_> Dreamglider: does iwconfig say anything?
[04:12] <defrysk> Enselic, what iso is it ?
[04:12] <nolimitsoya> c_lisp, though you can set one up yourself, using lvm and snapshots.
[04:13] <njal_> enselic: Did it pass it's md5 checksum?
[04:13] <Enselic> is a BIOS update for my computers
[04:13] <thirstyferret> c_lisp, nolimitsoya: I believe there's a backup app included with Automatix but I know of nothing the same as System Restore

[04:13] <Dark_Dragon> help
[04:13] <nolimitsoya> Enselic, then its probably not a "real" iso. anyway, its a binary file and you wont be able to get anything meaningsfull out of it
[04:13] <FRET> hey all
[04:14] <Dark_Dragon> ...
[04:14] <Enselic> nolimitsoya: It is bootable, so I guess there must be some kind of file there?

[04:14] <njal_> enselic: Yeah, hmm, i would follow nolimitsoya for advice, he probably knows more

[04:18] <anton_> njal_: i'm worried about the lack of an ip-capable device node
[04:18] <DarkY> cherubiel: now ill install network manager... oder is wifi-radar better?
[04:18] <FRET> nolimitsoya, no... not sure what you mean. I want to switch of the usb-harddisk before removing it
[04:19] <cherubiel> DarkY: you need the drivers first.. does iwconfig give anything for eth1 ?
[04:19] <cherubiel> DarkY: iwconfig
[04:19] <njal_> anton: yeah there is that, but wouldn't editing /etc/network/interfaces fix that?
[04:19] <DarkY> yes it does
[04:19] <ac7ss> how can I tell what X video driver is running?
[04:19] <nolimitsoya> renjith171, there are tons of different types of work that can be computer aided. be specific

[04:20] <Enselic> nolimitsoya, cherubiel, DexterF: thanks anyway
[04:20] <nolimitsoya> FRET, the usb plug is designed so that the + pins bread before the ground, specificaly to make thing hotswapable.

[04:29] <Dreamglider> njal_, i can only see WEP in the network settings !

[04:29] <Trelous> ya has anyone gotten WPA to work I tried but did not get it to on my laptop.
[04:29] <atomikulinux> Morrissey: Doesnt take up 20% for me so I guess its not normal
[04:30] <Morrissey> any idea of how to fix it?
[04:30] <lightstep> robbbb, i saw bugs 361168,360925,358950,358187 in mozilla's bugzilla about this. it seems there is a great confusion about all this new tab/new window behaviour in firefox. maybe you can try an older version.
[04:30] <dmnd> cherubiel: ok
[04:30] <renjith171> apt-get install realplay ....doesnt work !!
[04:31] <robbbb> lightstep: i'm not downgrading to pre 2

[04:31] <robbbb> i like a lot of the new features
[04:31] <cherubiel> dmnd: check the man page for xfwm4 as well
[04:31] <porkpie> what be the reason why when I use the up arrow to see the last commands typed I get garbbage

[04:32] <san_> hey can anyone help me getting wireless set up properly on an acer travelmate laptop
[04:32] <njal_> Dreamglider: There is something we might be able to try... But i don't know how well it will work

[04:32] <ubotu> Instant Messenger Clients: Gaim (GNOME, http://help.ubuntu.com/community/GaimHowto), Kopete (KDE), both supporting MSN, Jabber, AIM, Gadu-Gadu, Novell Groupwise, ICQ and IRC.
[04:32] <boink> I use gaim, works nicely for msn
[04:32] <renjith171> then is der no way other than downloading  d  realplayer pkg
[04:32] <njal_> san: What wireless card is it?
[04:32] <boink> renjith171: on dapper?
[04:32] <we2by> me too
[04:33] <we2by> but
[04:33] <renjith171> boink: yeah Dapper
[04:33] <boink> I use realplay .deb on dapper, works nicely
[04:33] <boink> you need to adjust your /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:33] <san_> its my friends laptop and im not entirely sure, the drivers ive got off the cd suggest its an ipw2200 built in card
[04:33] <san_> oh yeah btw im on edgy
[04:33] <renjith171> boink::which repositry shud i add fr that
[04:33] <san_> *the acer cd thay came with the laptop
[04:34] <boink> you can have a look at my sources.list
[04:34] <dmnd> cherubiel: do you have any idea of what's going on :)
[04:34] <njal_> san: run lspci from the command line, and see if it's listed
[04:34] <boink> http://cuba.calyx.nl//~oink/ubuntu-sources.list
[04:34] <boink> wireless in edgy is broken
[04:34] <cherubiel> dmnd: there is a switch for xfwm4 ; --compositor=on/off
[04:34] <lightstep> robbbb, perhaps the preferences dialog is wrong. try settings browser.link.open_newwinodow* in about:config
[04:34] <boink> I have a horrible problem
[04:34] <Trelous> dreamglider you could try this but it did not work for me for WPA but it's suppose to ... sudo apt-get >sudo apt-get install wpasupplicat>sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome network-manager>sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces>Comment out everything other than lo entries in that file and save the file>Create a file called /etc/default/wpasupplicant, add entry ENABLED=0 and save the file
[04:35] <dmnd> cherubiel: aaah, where do i set this?
[04:35] <san_> ah yeas  njal itss a intell 2200bg tirless card
=== dou213_ is now known as dou213
[04:35] <floating> boink thx
[04:35] <DekKeD> I want to install kde-devel package, but I get "BREAK (install)". Any solutions?
[04:35] <njal_> san: In the networking tool see if it'll 'JUST WORK'
[04:35] <cherubiel> dmnd: /usr/share/xsessions/xfce.desktop ? maybe? thats were the entires for d/kdm starts the sessions
[04:35] <cherubiel> dmnd: you should make one more .desktop entry with the composite swithc, try booting into that from the display manager
[04:35] <floating> Edit the makefile
[04:35] <floating>  - Check GTKINC and GTKLIBS to point to the GTK library, if necessary
[04:35] <floating>  - Check that BINDIR and LIBDIR are set to the location where you
[04:36] <floating> terrible paste. excuseme
[04:36] <dmnd> cherubiel: ok i will see if i can get this to work :)
[04:36] <Trelous> it will change so you can choose WEP / WPA ... but something did not work when I did it I am still trying to figure it out.
[04:36] <floating> the point was to ask, that I dont get the first one . check gtkinc etc....
[04:37] <san_> njal edgy didnt pick the card up in netowrking by default so i ndiswrapperer the driver, now the card is displayed in networking but doesnt work when its activated
[04:37] <lightstep> robbbb, after some playing with that option, return it to 3, and then it should work (you didn't want to downgrade, so you have to work around a bug)
[04:37] <ADminS> how i can test mic under ubuntu in laptop?
[04:37] <njal_> san: Am on the ndiswrapper page looking for your card now ;)
[04:37] <Trelous> O and your suppose to reboot after all that.
[04:37] <anton_> oo. my laptop won't let me switch of the wlan-card in bios.
[04:38] <san_> thank you so much i really appreciate your help
[04:38] <njal_> san: this sound about right '# Card: [Intel]  PRO/Wireless 2200BG'?
[04:38] <Curtman> How can I stop Ubuntu from setting my hostname to what my ISP provides in the dhcp lease?
[04:38] <san_> Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection thats copied from lspci
[04:38] <san_> so yep
[04:39] <boink> Curtman: you mean for what?
[04:39] <boink> have a look at your /etc/hostname
[04:39] <DekKeD> I want to install kde-devel package, but I get "BREAK (install)". Any solutions?
[04:39] <robbbb> lightstep: nice - it was set to 2
[04:39] <robbbb> i'll give it a whirl
[04:39] <Curtman> boink: Every time I reboot, my hostname gets changed to S010600c026a01375 or whatever.
[04:39] <we2by> guys, anything similar to mono?
[04:40] <we2by> crossplatform programming?
[04:40] <boink> but what's in your /etc/hostname ?
[04:40] <njal_> san: Go here
[04:40] <njal_> http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List#I
[04:40] <njal_> san: and go to number 6
[04:40] <njal_> looks like it's your card
[04:40] <Curtman> boink: /etc/hostname contains what I want.  Ubuntu changes it to my ISP when it brings up eth0
[04:40] <cherubiel> we2by: dotgnu ?
[04:40] <boink> great, then your isp assigns a name to your ip
[04:40] <willvdl> hi there, anyone using lm-sensors in edgy?
[04:40] <boink> is your ip dynamic or static?
[04:40] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[04:40] <cherubiel> Curtman: how do you see this "hostname"
[04:40] <we2by> cherubiel, which one do you prefer and why?
[04:41] <Curtman> boink: I just can't figure out how to configure dhcpcd to ignore that.
[04:41] <njal_> san: and it looks like you shall have to use the second driver
[04:41] <cherubiel> Curtman: i mean, where do you see that?
[04:41] <Pand0ra> having an issues with xvid codec (i assume) all other video formats seem to play fine but xvid is shakey vertically, even when paused. Not sure what would cause that or how to even describe that problem to search for it, any hints?
[04:41] <boink> it's not dhcpd. it's the dhclient
[04:41] <boink> man dhclient.conf
[04:41] <KnowledgEngi> i solved some problem with timidity but there is other problem now
[04:41] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/U6gcEp51.html
[04:41] <cherubiel> we2by: dotgnu since i hack on that :)
[04:41] <Zambezi> When I add an iprange in hosts.allow, should I do anything differnt compare to a IP? It's still sshd: 1.1.1.1-1.1.1.1 ?
[04:41] <san_> njal yeah that looks like the one can you help me through that, sorry if im being stupid im fairly new to all this
[04:41] <Curtman> cherubiel: At the login I see it, if I type 'hostname' I see it.  So I have to log in as root every time and set it manually.
[04:42] <boink> it's the ip number which has the name, not your box
[04:42] <we2by> cherubiel, itlooks like dotgnu is still under heavy development
[04:42] <njal_> san_: I can try
[04:42] <jorge_> hello world helpme
[04:42] <cherubiel> we2by: want to contribute? :)
[04:42] <boink> !ask
[04:42] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:42] <san_> thank you :)
[04:42] <willvdl> for some unknown reason, I have no i2c-sensors module
[04:42] <we2by> cherubiel, nah, I'm a c+= newbie
[04:42] <we2by> C++
[04:42] <njal_> san_: Ok, so download the second driver
[04:42] <njal_> and open the ndiswrapper gui
[04:43] <jorge_> how setting plugins
[04:43] <Narada> hi; which guide would you recommend to install xgl on kubuntu; there's so many of them and all different
[04:43] <jorge_> mp3
[04:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell narada about xgl | narada, you have a private message from Ubotu
[04:43] <Curtman> boink: But what do I set in dhclient.conf is the question..
[04:43] <cherubiel> we2by: both implement the .net spec
[04:43] <san_> okay
[04:43] <njal_> san_: Install driver and point it to the driver exe file
[04:44] <Narada> LjL: thanks
[04:44] <san_> okay even though its looking for an ing?
[04:44] <san_> *inf
[04:44] <we2by> cherubiel, yea, but looking at both version number, Mono is a bit better
[04:45] <njal_> san_: I know it wants an inf, but the driver came packaged as a exe, i don't know how to open it
[04:45] <GhoSt_DoG> how i resolv this  problem? Totem incapaz de reproduzir 'mmsh://ir1-c200.narrowstep.tv/mcp?psid=12439228&ref=0&chid=2&pid=208&vid=9929417&br=800&tid=2&brid=3&MSWMExt=.asf'.

[04:46] <we2by> I just installed monodevelop on the wrong machine!
[04:46] <we2by> :(
[04:46] <san_> okay ill try that
[04:46] <Zarephath> njal_: It also could just be a zip executable or some form thereof that will extract to a temp directory first...you might be able to get it from the temp folder as well...
[04:46] <san_> or can i try and open it in wine?
[04:46] <njal_> san_: Let me know how it goes
[04:46] <Curtman> boink: I think I might have found it..  supersede host-name "ultrix";
[04:46] <njal_> san_: Follow zaraphaths idea first
[04:46] <san_> okay im opening it in wine atm

[04:49] <crayzee> I am installing Edgy on a PC, but the PC keeps shutting down. The message I get is that the system is reaching a critical temperature (-273C) and is shutting down.

[04:50] <floating> Where are gtk libraries located? I shold point to that dir in makefile, how to add it in here: GTKLIBS=`gtk-config --libs`
[04:50] <crayzee> njal_, it is fine. It has been running dapper happily for ages. And its running happily at 5k rev/s so it ain't that.
[04:50] <Zarephath> Doesn't lm_sensors help with some of that too?
[04:50] <san_> njal no luck :(
[04:50] <crayzee> I think it is an lm_sensors or similar bug
[04:50] <crayzee> Possibly kernel thermal_zone?
[04:50] <crayzee> something like that...
[04:50] <Stegozor> Hi, how can I launch file explorer as super user? I mean, sudo cd doesn't work in the Terminal, so I'd like to gksudo "file browser"
[04:50] <LjL> crayzee: possibly i do
[04:50] <LjL> crayzee: hold on a second, let me find the bug report
[04:51] <san_> Stegozor sudo nautilus
[04:51] <Stegozor> san: thanks
[04:51] <tonyyarusso> Stegozor: Why would you use sudo on cd?
[04:51] <Stegozor> there's a file in home, it's hiden and named .Trash-root
[04:51] <LjL> crayzee: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/44805 <- see my comments
[04:51] <njal_> san_: try sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
[04:51] <LjL> crayzee: (search for "BIOS")
[04:52] <tonyyarusso> Stegozor: Okay
[04:52] <Stegozor> I'd like to have a look in it, and possibly delete it to save disk space
[04:52] <we2by> mhh, Mono looks alot like VB! :D
[04:52] <tonyyarusso> Stegozor: just cd normally, and use sudo on rm when you get rid of it
[04:52] <javaJake> OK, forum speeds are getting better now
[04:52] <javaJake> So, never mind
[04:52] <we2by> but then with C++ style
[04:52] <Zarephath> anyone know of a channel where I can find out about burning back mp3 to red audio however I wan't to maintain the tag information so it will show up on the player as artist/title
[04:52] <LjL> crayzee: so, basically, try disabling "Shutdown When CPU Fan Fail" if you have it enabled in the BIOS
[04:53] <crayzee> LjL, as it happens I have already read that! The BIOS only lets me see the fan speed, nothing else. Not even the processor temperature.
[04:53] <san_> njal no luck, just a thought, its a laptop with  hardware switch which isnt activating in ubuntu maybe i have to get drivers for that??
[04:53] <LjL> crayzee: hmm
[04:53] <LjL> crayzee: is it not AwardBIOS?
[04:53] <Stegozor> tonyyarusso : ok. two questions: why does sudo cd not work? is this normal ?   and is the "strange" file I'm talking about is safely deletable?

[04:54] <thinh> does anyone know how to get tv tuner card working?
[04:54] <crayzee> *PhoenixBIOS
[04:54] <tonyyarusso> Stegozor: Probably b/c it just thinks it's super-weird.  The file is actually a directory - see what its contents are.
[04:54] <njal_> san_: run sudo gedit /etc/modules
[04:54] <stoop> hello am new can you tell me what i instal
[04:54] <Stegozor> oh, it just contains an account I deleted
[04:54] <san_> yep
[04:55] <tonyyarusso> stoop: I don't think I understand your question
[04:55] <njal_> san_: Add ndiswrapper at the end of the file, this should tell the system to run ndiswrapper at boot
[04:55] <LjL> crayzee: well, i don't know then, try disabling anything that seems related to temperature checking or fan speed checking...
[04:55] <san_> done :D
[04:55] <njal_> san_: The ultimate test is to reboot without the network cable in, then telling me after the reboot
[04:56] <san_> okay ill do that now thanks alot
[04:56] <crayzee> LjL: How?
[04:56] <stoop> i dont know what i have to instal mediaplayers ... and the sutch

[05:07] <njal_> san_: Remove the ndiswrapper entry from /etc/modules reboot and then run the modprobe command, this will see if ndiswrapper is having problems at boot, erm no, i doubt it

[05:12] <mrspinx2> it is looking for www-config or similar, which doesn't exist. to uninstall it looks for this *i think*
[05:13] <thinh> i just wanna watch tv on it so what would be my choose of installation
[05:13] <uBaHoB> I use LiveCD and ppoeconf to setup the internet (not ADSL, trough LAN). I can connect, but I can't ping and open sites. plog shows me "replacing existing default route through ppp0" and
[05:13] <LjL> mrspinx2: hm, kay, do you also have /var/lib/dpkg/info/joomla.postrm
[05:13] <thinh> frontend or backend anyone?
[05:13] <robbbb> what is the command to change themes in KDE?
[05:14] <uBaHoB> and other error in plog is "Cannot determine ethernet address for poxy ARP"

[05:19] <ubotu> thinh: MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV
[05:20] <stoop> so howto fix xine into playing sound ? ... it doesnt while rythembox does
[05:20] <njal_> san_: Did you run modprobe after you logged in, or did it just work?
[05:20] <san_> no it started buy itself
[05:20] <LjL> mrspinx2: this could be kind of dangerous... but you can try executing that script manually, and see why it's failing
[05:21] <LjL> mrspinx2: would be "sh -v /var/lib/dpkg/info/joomla.postrm"
[05:21] <LjL> mrspinx2: would be "sh -v /var/lib/dpkg/info/joomla.postrm purge" actually
[05:23] <njal_> san_: reboot a couple of more times, just to make sure it's not a fluke then i would be happy
[05:23] <njal_> san_: That's what i would do
[05:23] <Dark_Dragon> !wine

[05:24] <san_> *say
[05:25] <uBaHoB> i have question about PPPoE and LiveCD ubuntu 6.10
[05:25] <Cuddles_in_KY> morning all.
[05:25] <Curtman> This is very annoying..  It's still changing my hostname every reboot.  :(
[05:26] <mrspinx2> LjL: well, w/ -v it just cat'ed it to STDOUT -- w/o it it just ran and didn't do much :-/
[05:26] <LjL> mrspinx2, pastebin what it output to stdout
[05:26] <Cuddles_in_KY> i'm having a slight problem using ndiswrapper on my laptop. i've got the driver installed, but when i do ''modprobe ndiswrapper'' i get ''invalid argument''. any suggestions on debugging/fixing this? the network card is using the wpndis51 driver (wavelan 1200).
[05:26] <LjL> mrspinx2: (i know it output the script itself, but i want to check out if it output all of it)
[05:29] <Cuddles_in_KY> anyone?
[05:29] <mabus> How do I install a package that's on a cd? Like, install a package onto an ubuntu system from a xubuntu cd or vice versa.
[05:30] <mabus> I like xcfe but ubuntu has more useful programs.
[05:30] <tupa> excuse me: where are the apt files downloaded?
[05:30] <sundried> hi, is there a console base network configuration tool for dapper server?
[05:30] <LjL> mabus: "sudo apt-cdrom add", with the CD inserted
[05:30] <LjL> mabus: then "sudo apt-get update"
[05:30] <woro2006> hi
[05:30] <mabus> sundried: you mean like, ifconfig? :/
[05:31] <woro2006> how do I manually add/remove gnome session start up commands
[05:31] <mabus> LjL: I went into the respositories menu and added the cd. That didn't work.
[05:31] <woro2006> where do I find that file?
[05:31] <sundried> mabus: no i don't want to edit /etc/network interfaces.
[05:31] <mabus> LjL: I assume those commands accomplish the same thing.
[05:31] <defrysk> tupa, /var/cache/apt/archives/ you mean ?
[05:31] <LjL> mabus: i don't know, i don't have Gnome, so i don't know what the repositories menu accomplishes
[05:31] <woro2006> after I add beryl-manager to session start up, it won't start again
[05:31] <mabus> sundried: Well what do you want to configure in regards to your network?
[05:31] <woro2006> it crashes every time
[05:32] <mabus> LjL: Well actually that was in xcfe, but alas. I'll try those commands when I get home to my xubuntu box.
[05:32] <woro2006> so I want to remove it so that beryl-manager doesn't start up automatically
[05:32] <sundried> mabus: i just can't remember the name of that package i should apt-get but i know there is a console based network tool where you can just enter ip address, subnetmask, gateway, dns.
[05:32] <P2K> woro2006 System/preferences/Sesion/
[05:32] <LjL> mabus: well Gnome or Xfce - whatever, it's KDE that i use ;)
[05:32] <LjL> sundried: ifconfig? :o)
[05:32] <sundried> sort of like apt-get install netconfig. anybody remember?
[05:32] <woro2006> I can't even login
[05:33] <woro2006> as that user, how can I edit session
[05:33] <tupa> defrysk: yes, that is, i found some deb files i just downloaded, can i install with them if i format my pc (same os)?
[05:33] <mabus> sundried: Well I bet you know what you're doing but you can do all of that with ifconfig.
[05:33] <woro2006> gnome crashes every time after I added "beryl-manager" as the startup command for that user
[05:33] <Dreamglider> can i get all my bookmakrs from firefox in windows to firefox in ubuntu ?
[05:33] <defrysk> tupa, with caution you can most app are available with apt-get tho
[05:33] <mrspinx2> LjL: http://pastebin.ca/257642
[05:34] <woro2006> now I want to edit that manually to remove beryl-manager from starting up
[05:34] <Cuddles_in_KY> i'm having a slight problem using ndiswrapper on my laptop. i've got the driver installed, but when i do ''modprobe ndiswrapper'' i get ''invalid argument''. any suggestions on debugging/fixing this? the network card is using the wpndis51 driver (wavelan 1200).
[05:34] <P2K> Dreamglider: yes
[05:34] <sundried> LjL: i know about ifconfig, editing /etc/networks/interfaces, editng /etc/resolv.conf etc. i just want to remember that console based network configuration tool.
[05:34] <Dreamglider> P2K, how pleas
[05:34] <kippi> hey
[05:34] <mrspinx2> hmm, don't know if that pasted or not
[05:34] <dudanogueira> Dreamglider, you can export them and import, or use some plugins for syncing with a web site, or a ftp file
[05:34] <san_> njab it works fine thanks flor all yr help
[05:34] <LjL> mrspinx2, ok, i'm out of ideas, i can probably tell you how to make apt-get happy, but the package will risk not being fully removed
[05:35] <mabus> sundried: The GUI network-config is a frontend for ifconfig...
[05:35] <tupa> defrysk: yeah, but i need the sources after reformatting, otherwise, my wireless card will not compile
[05:35] <tupa> thx man
[05:35] <mabus> sundried: What do you want to do that ifconfig doesn't?
[05:35] <mrspinx2> hmmm
[05:35] <Dreamglider> dudanogueira, i cant export them, the i cant boot windows
[05:35] <kippi> I have a x300 with a wireless card, I have installed the drivers using nswrapper etc, it says the card is there and the driver is there but i still can't connect to my wireless network, anyideas?
[05:36] <mrspinx2> i need to reconnect - irssi is just acting up on me too much
[05:36] <Fall2Hell> how do i install ubuntu using the alternate cd??
[05:36] <sundried> mabus: what do you do if you want to start or stop network services? you type "/etc/init.d/network_service" stop right?
[05:36] <LjL> Fall2Hell: just boot from it and follow the instructions
[05:36] <dudanogueira> Fall2Hell, download, burn a disc, boot from the disk and follow the instructions
[05:36] <tonyyarusso> Fall2Hell: pop it in and go
[05:36] <sundried> mabus: would you rather do "/etc/init.d/networkservice start/stop" than to use rcconf?
[05:37] <sundried> mabus: to be able to install rcconf, you have to do apt-get install rcconf right?
[05:37] <we2by> isn't netscape and firefox the same webbrowser?
[05:37] <boink> sundried: ifdown eth0
[05:37] <mabus> sundried: It's an ifconfig option, I'm not on an ubuntu box right now. But to start it is ifconfig eth0 up for instance
[05:37] <boink> or ifup eth0
[05:37] <LjL> we2by: no
[05:37] <dudanogueira> we2by, they are based on the same engine
[05:37] <boink> netscape really doesn't exist anymore
[05:37] <boink> and mozilla was a complete re-write of the code
[05:37] <mabus> boink: It does on this crappy library box... :/
[05:37] <mrspinx> LjL : http://pastebin.ca/257642
[05:38] <boink> when they saw the netscape code in 1998, they decided a complete re-write was needed
[05:38] <sundried> mabus: now i'm looking for a rcconf tool like for network configuration. a console based tool that would just prompt me for IP address, netmask, gateway address and dns server ip's and not bother with ifconfig or editing /etc/network/interfaces.
[05:38] <P2K> Dreamglider: im looking for the link
[05:38] <sundried> mabus: i know there is a package that do just that. i just don't remember it's name so i can not apt-get it.
[05:39] <LjL> mrspinx: i saw the paste, but i have no clue unfortunately. i can probably tell you how to make APT believe that the package is fully removed, but you'll probably be left with a package that's *not* fully removed
[05:39] <mabus> sundried: Well that package would really be just a trivial way of working with ifconfig... you could write a script in a number of languages to do that in minutes.
[05:39] <highneko_> !lightscribe
[05:39] <boink> and what's wrong with joe interfaces ?
[05:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lightscribe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:39] <boink> joe is a very easy editor to use
[05:39] <mabus> sundried: In fact since it asks for each, each time... it's really much more inconvenient than ifconfig.
[05:40] <highneko_> Has anyone got lightscribe working for ubuntu edgy?
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> hellp
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> fantastic
[05:40] <boink> !ask
[05:40] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:40] <Fall2Hell> tonyyarusso when i pop it at windows nothing appen windows don know the files.
[05:40] <LjL> mrspinx: just edit /var/lib/dpkg/info/joomla.postrm and add a line "exit 0" right after the first line, if you want that
[05:40] <linux_kid> Hey, has anyone got a broadcom 4311 card to work without linuxant?
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> now timidity work good
[05:40] <tonyyarusso> Fall2Hell: reboot
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> and use the correct soundfont
[05:40] <Curtman> Screw it.. I put a script in /etc/networks/if-up.d/ to fix my hostname..  It really shouldn't be this difficult to override the hostname from a dhcp lease.  :(
[05:40] <KnowledgEngi> i'm a genius
[05:40] <porcho> where can I find a irc channel on java-gnome?
=== barteek is now known as bartek
[05:41] <jenda> porcho: you can try #ubuntu-java not sure if it's the right chan, though.
[05:42] <boink> Curtman: what does man dhclient.conf say?
[05:42] <Morrissey>  Wich driver should I use with ATI Radeon 9000? For now I have the "radeon" drivers, and beryl works, just kind of slow ...<--- FOR XGL/BERYL
[05:42] <TheShrimp> hello, i'm kinda new to ubuntu, how do you get ATI Drivers for it, once your done installing to get the correct screen resoultion?
[05:43] <boink> The  DHCP protocol allows the client to request that the server send it specific information, and not send it other information that it is  not prepared  to  accept.
[05:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell TheShrimp about ati | TheShrimp, you have a private message from Ubotu
[05:43] <KnowledgEngi> I think that the ubuntu howto about timidity need an update :)
[05:43] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/XS7bfB36.html
[05:43] <linux_kid> Has anyone here got a Broadcom 4311 wireless card to work without Linuxant?
[05:43] <KnowledgEngi> i solved the problem using this procedure
[05:43] <pibarnas> is anyone having problems with swiftfox/firefox downloads on edgy amd64?? I can only download file correctly with opera...
[05:44] <mrspinx> LjL: :D thanks!
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> is better install the soundfont in this path
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> /usr/share/timidity/soundfonts/
[05:44] <Curtman> boink: Lots..  I figured this would fix the problem, but didn't:  supersede host-name "ultrix";
[05:45] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[05:45] <stoop> how do i debug why xine doesnt have sound Rythembox does ?
[05:45] <Curtman> boink: I have no idea why I can do the same thing with domain-name, and it works but host-name doesn't.
[05:45] <DreamerHxC> ubuntu doesn't work for me : my desktop gets freezed just after logging in, but ubuntu does work, do u know why?
[05:46] <P2K> ...
[05:46] <P2K> you said the samething works and doesnt
[05:46] <P2K> unless i read that worng
[05:46] <P2K> *wrong
[05:47] <pibarnas> <DreamerHxC> have u just installed it?
[05:47] <boink> Curtman: you need to set up your dhclient.conf to do what you what it to do
[05:47] <linux_kid> DreamerHxC: what do you mean?
[05:47] <DreamerHxC> that
[05:47] <boink> most people don't need a dhclient.conf
[05:47] <highneko_> Has anyone gotten lightscribe working for ubuntu edgy?
[05:47] <DreamerHxC> i cannot boot up with livecd ubuntu, but i can with livecd kubunut
[05:47] <Dreamglider> P2K, to me ?
[05:47] <boink> I've never used lightscribe :)
[05:47] <Curtman> boink: I realize that.  And I've configured dhclient.conf how I think it should be, but it still doesn't work.
[05:47] <elias_> is anybody using vmware server on edgy sucessfully? I was having some problems with it: https://launchpad.net/bugs/64773
[05:48] <TokenBad> is there a reason that nautilus would be crashing over and over and over?
[05:48] <P2K> Dreamglider: no im still looking for yours... sigh
[05:48] <pibarnas> <DreamerHxC> did you check the media?
[05:48] <Curtman> boink: That is why I am here.  :)
[05:48] <TokenBad> This is a fresh install of ubuntu dapper...just did install yesterday
[05:48] <DreamerHxC> i don't know why but with ubuntu my desktop gets freezed and I just can move my mouse, switch to console or ctrl + alt + backspace
[05:48] <boink> most people don't care, Curtman
[05:48] <DreamerHxC> I even tried ATi and nvidia and I get the same for both of them
[05:48] <P2K> Dreamglider: can you still access your windows partition ?
[05:48] <boink> but you don't want that
[05:48] <boink> what does google say?
[05:49] <stoop> so is ther anywhy why xine doesnt play and rythemBox does ?
[05:49] <Dreamglider> P2K, yes
[05:49] <stoop> *xine doesnt
[05:49] <pibarnas> <DreamerHxC> weird because I think in livecd it uses vesa driver for X...
[05:49] <DreamerHxC> really weird
[05:49] <defrysk> stoop, you need xinelibs extra codecs
[05:49] <DreamerHxC> i've been 3 days with this, i've left 3 different threas in forum but no one knows
[05:49] <pibarnas> <DreamerHxC> what are your monitor and your video board?
[05:50] <P2K> Dreamglider: do a search in your windows partition for bookmarks.html
[05:50] <DreamerHxC> monitor samsung 753dfx but I tried with another monitor
[05:50] <DreamerHxC> I tried with nvidia fx5200 (im using this right now) and ati 955

[05:56] <ProN00b> nautilus is not a client

[05:56] <ProN00b> it doesn't even show the ftp traffic

[05:56] <TokenBad> or would I need to reinstall?
[05:56] <dot_j> that wouldnt reinstall it
[05:56] <edgy> ProN00b: what do you mean by better?
[05:57] <dot_j> just clear out settings
[05:57] <TokenBad> dot_j, ok....cause it crashes everytime open it to browse files
[05:57] <pibarnas> <TokenBad> the first reboot?!
[05:57] <s|k_> is it possible to copy a hdd from one to the other
[05:57] <TokenBad> pibarnas, no...like 3rd
[05:57] <s|k_> and then boot from the copy?
=== AntiSpamBot_ is now known as AntiSpamBot
[05:58] <dot_j> TokenBad: i've had that happen to me with other apps - deleting the settings directory usually works for me (although i'm not sure that's the _best_ way to go about it)
[05:58] <pibarnas> <TokenBad> have you done some king of configuration mess, or install some weird application?
[05:58] <ProN00b> edgy, well, gftp looks crap (gui element placement fail) and handles alot of files kinda shit, so for something to be better it should not have those issues, still show me what its doing (raw ftp commands in scroll window) and give me an overall better experience

[05:59] <cello_rasp> wtf. Firefox won't open new pages
[05:59] <mc__> ProN00b: please don tbe so rude
[05:59] <lsproc> I have set my workgroup for samba, but when I go to Windows Network, nothing shows up
[05:59] <cello_rasp> I can enter a url into the address bar and it will load but it wont display!!
[06:00] <TokenBad> dot_j, I can't even find the .nautalis dir
[06:00] <LjL> TokenBad: .nautilus ?
[06:00] <ProN00b> mc__, dude, What ?
[06:00] <Delano> Hi... I can't log in as root when x starts up... it says "Administrator cannot log in from here"... what is wrong?
[06:01] <TokenBad> pibarnas, no...just the normal stuff, xchat, xmms, mplayer, klibido, par2, rar....and the restricted formats...and thats it
[06:01] <TokenBad> well the nvidia drivers
[06:01] <LjL> Delano: nothing. logging in as root graphically is just very bad, and it's disabled
[06:01] <ProN00b> TokenBad, files starting with a dot are hidden by default in nautius, enable "Show Hidden Files"
[06:01] <pibarnas> <TokenBad> the directory is there for sure. It has a dot before, it's ".nautilus".
[06:01] <Delano> LjL, but I could do it before
[06:01] <LjL> Delano: besides, in Ubuntu, root is disabled in general
[06:01] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Delano about root | Delano, you have a private message from Ubotu
[06:01] <dot_j> TokenBad: are you familiar with hidden directories? .nautalis is hidden (hence the .)
[06:01] <dot_j> in a terminal do cd ~
[06:01] <dot_j> ls -l
[06:01] <TokenBad> ProN00b, I can't open nautilus...thats why trying to fix it...it crashes
[06:01] <dot_j> sorry
[06:01] <dot_j> ls -al
[06:02] <Delano> LjL, I need to log in as root to edit a file in .x11
[06:02] <ProN00b> TokenBad, oh
[06:02] <LjL> Delano: why can't you use sudo for that?
[06:02] <Delano> LjL, I can try, but last time I did it wouldn't save any modified files
[06:02] <crayzee> LjL, do you remember me from earlier re: restarting edgy install/"critical temperature"?
[06:02] <AfterDeath> Delano: pull up terminal, and sudo <editor program>
[06:03] <edgy> ProN00b: did you try kbear?
[06:03] <LjL> crayzee: yes
[06:03] <defrysk> TokenBad, open nautilus with the cli and paste the crashing output to pastebin maybe someone can help you then
[06:03] <AfterDeath> Delano: it wouldn't let you save modified files because you weren't running the editor under sudo
[06:03] <LjL> Delano: don't know why that would be, but i find it very hard to relate it to sudo vs "real" root. do what AfterDeath said
[06:03] <ProN00b> edgy, kde ? kde is bad bad bad !
[06:03] <Acu> greetings. I am trying to make php and apache2.2.3 work and when I try to open any index.php the browser tries to save it instead of running it - any configuration in apache or php should be changed?
[06:03] <LjL> Delano: and read the bot's link about sudo
[06:03] <TokenBad> defrysk, with cli?
[06:03] <crayzee> LjL: well, I have found that it is the thermal_zone that is doing it (the shutdown temperature is the same as one listed in /proc/???/thermal_zone/???/something
[06:03] <crayzee> (-264C)
[06:04] <defrysk> TokenBad, command line interface like a console
[06:04] <TokenBad> defrysk, oh...
[06:04] <crayzee> So.. is there a way to disable thermal_zone in the kernel boot line?
[06:04] <LjL> crayzee: hmm well, but with acpi=off, i believe that thermal zone support shouldn't even be present
[06:04] <Delano> That's too tedious, LjL
[06:04] <LjL> Delano: uh?
[06:04] <Delano> I don't like to be locked out of my own system
[06:05] <TokenBad> defrysk, ok did nautilus in console and it just crashed right off...no output
[06:05] <crayzee> LjL, I dont think it starts with acpi=off
[06:05] <Delano> How can I bypass the root lockout?
[06:05] <ADminS> how i can test my VGA driver installed rite?
[06:05] <LjL> Delano: the page explains that. if you really want to do it, which you shouldn't.
[06:05] <LjL> crayzee: doesn't start because it gives the same problem, or doesn't start because of something else?
[06:05] <TokenBad> let me try rebooting yet again....brb
[06:06] <jernst> Delano: sudo -s and you'll be root
[06:06] <Delano> I'm a big boy, LjL, if I can drive a car without crashing it then I can run my OS without wrecking it :op
[06:06] <LjL> Delano: then do it by following the instructions on that page
[06:07] <Delano> Oh it's simple
[06:07] <crayzee> LjL: something else
[06:07] <LjL> Delano: you certainly aren't expecting us to spoonfeed you on something that is not supported, do you? that page has all the information that you asked for
[06:07] <lsproc> argh
[06:07] <Delano> LjL, no, sorry, I see it now
[06:07] <lsproc> I set my workgroup for samba, but it isnt showing up in Network

[06:10] <dudanogueira> lir1, click on a sample file, properties, open with, choose the programa and set it to all files

[06:44] <eyequeue> dot_j, it's informative only, no actions
[06:44] <donmoog> eyequeue: Thanks, I understand that. But does that mean anything outside of main is not free? :)
[06:44] <dot_j> so if you start from a default install and install vrms, you still will have non-free software on the system?
[06:45] <dot_j> ah... just info...
[06:45] <apokryphos> the Ubuntu CD comes with a lot of non-free stuff. Unless you do some serious hacking, there's no guarantees that that won't end up your system

[06:46] <dot_j> so why would linux-powerpc be included in the non-free list?
[06:46] <donmoog> eyequeue: Thanks, thats what I thought... which wouldn't really help me find a package that isn't free :-( vrms is a perfect answer though, so thanks.
[06:46] <eyequeue> donmoog, are you familiar with how to get rid of the cron job? :)
[06:46] <donmoog> eyequeue: But of course :-)

[07:40] <livingtm> polpak, yeah it sounds like thats mostly for system or application files. /home is probably the best place. /home/media or something
[07:40] <polpak> jerp: you can either use sudo to put the file in /usr/local/bin   or you can put the file in /home/username/bin if it's something intended primaraly for your user.
[07:41] <eyequeue> jerp, nor is it advisible.  use /usr/local/bin if you must, not /usr/bin
[07:41] <dougughasdfa> guys
[07:41] <dougughasdfa> I have a problem
[07:41] <apokryphos> !problem
[07:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about problem - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:41] <apokryphos> !problem is <alias> ask
[07:41] <ubotu> I'll remember that, apokryphos
[07:41] <apokryphos> !ask
[07:41] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:41] <dougughasdfa> I am trying to hookup to my computer downstairs to so I can move my mp3 folder onto that computer
[07:41] <illuminator> I'm having trouble getting my sound card configured properly.  Machine is Alienware Area 51m 7700, lspci returns "00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 03)" uses driver: snd-hda-intel
[07:41] <dougughasdfa> but I don't know how to get there
[07:42] <Jager> Active
[07:42] <dougughasdfa> I went to network settings
[07:42] <jerp> I just tried the  sudo nano /etc/cron-weekly/apt-security-updates  but it wouldn't let me save  :\
[07:42] <dougughasdfa> and windows network
[07:42] <dougughasdfa> and windows network
[07:42] <LjL> !enter | dougughasdfa
[07:42] <ubotu> dougughasdfa: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[07:42] <H3g3m0n> dougughasdfa: Is the folder shared?
[07:43] <Jager> ActivE_UK: Okay.. now im in a window that says grub>
[07:43] <dougughasdfa> idk
[07:43] <dougughasdfa> can I make a folder
[07:43] <Jager> I did this cd /boot/grub/
[07:43] <Jager> then
[07:43] <Jager> sudo gedt menu.1st
[07:43] <Jager> gedit*
[07:43] <ActivE_UK> ok
[07:43] <Tallen> anyone using the MCP51 chipset with Nvidia? I am having a time getting the sound card working.
[07:43] <ActivE_UK> so you have the grub menu list up now yes?
[07:43] <Jager> yes
[07:43] <LjL> livingtm: you know what? by reading http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html pointed to by polpak, i'd be tempted to say that /usr/local/share is a good place. but... uhm.
[07:43] <ActivE_UK> ok scroll down and find the entry for your windows xp
[07:44] <Jager> Well.. it just says like "push TAb for commands"
[07:44] <Jager> and then has a grub> where i can type something
[07:44] <ActivE_UK> where are you doing this from?
[07:44] <Jager> uh.. terminal
[07:45] <ActivE_UK> im not sure why you have a grub command line up :S
[07:45] <jerp> tallen, are you dapper or edgy?
[07:45] <Jager> lol
[07:45] <polpak> LjL: except that /usr/local/share has the same requirements /usr/share does, and /usr/share is supposed to be read only (ideally)
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[07:45] <Jager> that what came up... maybe i can just manually open the menu.1st?
[07:45] <ActivE_UK> you should just have the menu.lst file open in gedit
[07:45] <Jager> ill go try that
[07:45] <LjL> polpak: well, if you "ideally" assume that your music collection is not changing ;)
[07:45] <Jager> brb
[07:45] <ActivE_UK> type this : sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:46] <LjL> polpak: after all, all of /usr is changing when you install programs. so, you can see adding new music just as you see installing new programs
[07:46] <Tallen> jerp: Edgy, I tried fetching Alsa 1.0.13 and installing direct from Source, the card is seen and listed in /proc/asound/cards, but I just get noise when I try to play an OGG with aplay.
[07:46] <donmoog> It depends on how the person would access the media I think. For example, if you're using mpd to serve up your music, it may be appropriate to use /home/mpd/ as the media source
[07:46] <Jager> i just went into /boot/grub/ and double clicked menu.1st lol
[07:47] <Jager> ok its open
[07:47] <polpak> donmoog: if you're using mpd I'd suggest /var/lib/mpd should be where the data is stored
[07:47] <ActivE_UK> well you can do that but you wont have write access
[07:47] <donmoog> Or maybe /var/music/. /usr/share/ and /var/lib/ seem wrong personally
[07:47] <Jager> Um.. lemme go check..
[07:47] <LjL> polpak: and while on debian-style systems you're really not supposed to touch /usr, /usr/local is an exception
[07:47] <defrysk> Jager, this way you have no perms to write in it
[07:47] <LjL> polpak: hmm, i'm really not sure that the location of a music library should depend on what program you're using to listen to it :-\
[07:47] <donmoog> polpak: If it was samba-shared, would you you use /var/lib/samba/ ? :S
[07:48] <renjith171> Beryl or Compiz which is d BEST
[07:48] <ActivE_UK> Beryl #beryl
[07:48] <LjL> !best | renjith171
[07:48] <ubotu> renjith171: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[07:48] <polpak> donmoog: if it was a global share for samba, then probably so yes
[07:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell renjith171 about beryl | renjith171, you have a private message from Ubotu

[07:49] <Narada> how do you disable a kernel module liek agpgart?
[07:50] <ActivE_UK> ok well i guess your config file is elsewhere. Im a noobie so maybe someone else can point you to the correct file.
[07:50] <Jager> no it was in /boot/grub/
[07:50] <Jager> cause when i opened it without write permissions i could see al the stuff in it
[07:50] <donmoog> Jager, ActivE_UK: That's a .lst - short for list, not 1st (first)

[07:57] <renjith171> can anyone help me out with my problem i mentioned

[07:58] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: laptop.
[07:58] <Jakadinho> hy guys i have BIG fawor to ask
[07:59] <apokryphos> !ask
[07:59] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:59] <TheGino_Frank> donmoog, dont know
[07:59] <Jakadinho> i hope someone can solwe my problem
[07:59] <Jakadinho> Here isthe thing. Until yesterday my laptop worked perfectly but since i install networkmanger-gnome and restart computer i get few blak screens and than it shows login screen (it should login automatickly) and when i enter Username and Pass i get few black screens agen and then logn windows apear.
[07:59] <Jakadinho> I tried to login in KDE but the same resault. I cannot even login in Terminal failsave.
[07:59] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: internal could be minipci or usb. any info with lspci or lsusb?
[07:59] <ActivE_UK> ok, when i had this problem that was the line that was causing it. Grub uses this line to locate your windows installation. hd0 says which hard disk to look at and the 0 says which partition.
[07:59] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: lemme see.
[08:00] <Jager> okay...
[08:00] <TheGino_Frank> donmoog, know that 82810 has no support drivers i run on 82810E
[08:00] <ActivE_UK> so for this to work in your case windows would be located on the first partition of the first hard disk. I think :P.
[08:00] <thenetduck> donmoog ok, so it say's Vendor: Intel Coperation Device: 82810 CGC [Chipset Graphics Status:Status Bus Type: PCI Device Type: Unknown Capiblities: Unknown
[08:00] <Jager> so i change it to hd1,1??
[08:00] <Jager> or what? theres two 0's lol
[08:00] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: nope.
[08:00] <Jager> hd0,0
[08:00] <dRk_sHd0w> I am trying to install a tar.gz and am trying to put the file inside usr/local/root and it's saying I don't have the permissions anyone know how to fix that??
[08:00] <ActivE_UK> Jager that entirely depends on where your windows installation is.
[08:01] <dRk_sHd0w> i mean usr/local/src
[08:01] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: without knowing the exact type we cannot continue
[08:01] <Jager> its on hd1.. i think
[08:01] <kitche> dRk_sHd0w: you need to use sudo
[08:01] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: hang on then.
[08:01] <ActivE_UK> ok which partition do you think?
[08:01] <dRk_sHd0w> what's sudo
[08:01] <Jakadinho> Here is the the thiing. Until yesterday my laptop worked perfectly but since i install networkmanger-gnome and restart computer i get few blak screens and than it shows login screen (it should login automatickly) and when i enter Username and Pass i get few black screens agen and then logn windows apear.
[08:01] <Jakadinho> I tried to login in KDE but the same resault. I cannot even login in Terminal failsave.
[08:01] <Jager> first
[08:01] <ActivE_UK> ok do perhaps hd1,0 would d it
[08:01] <kitche> !sudo|dRk_aHd0w
[08:01] <ubotu> dRk_aHd0w: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[08:01] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: there has to be something in the lspci or lsusb output
[08:01] <Jager> okay brb :) :)
[08:01] <apokryphos> ubotu: repeat | Jakadinho
[08:01] <ubotu> Jakadinho: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[08:02] <TheGino_Frank> thenetduck, click the advance tab for more info

[08:03] <Jager> Now i get a message sayinbg Erro 21: Disk does not exist (or along those lines)
[08:03] <dRk_sHd0w> what is sudo??
[08:04] <adrap> ,/quit
[08:04] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: went over lspci line by line.
[08:04] <jbroome> su do

[08:04] <kitche> blanky: put after you connect to the server
[08:04] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: and how do you know its a ralink card anyway?
[08:04] <kitche> dRk_sHd0w: read what ubotu says
[08:04] <blanky> kitche, ah, 'put myfile.txt'
[08:04] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: because it had ralink drivers in windows when I first booted the computer.
[08:04] <blanky> thanks kitche
[08:04] <ActivE_UK> ok lol, well if you only have one hard disk its always going to be hd0

[08:05] <Jager> oh..
[08:05] <Jager> is it hd0, 1?
[08:05] <blanky> mikeR, you might want to ask in irc.mozilla.org #firefox
[08:05] <ActivE_UK> try that
[08:05] <Jager> k  brb
[08:05] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: maybe there is a bios option to disable the card or a button on the notebook to enable/disable the card

[08:10] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: i seems no one uses linux on that thing. i just googled.
[08:10] <ActivE_UK> Jager im not sure what that means. Could mean you have the wrong partition still.
[08:10] <H3g3m0n> sigp239: On the boot screen theres an F# key for somthing like extra options, just add it to the line there
[08:10] <ActivE_UK> Are you sure your windows partition was not erased?
[08:10] <Jager> I hope my windows didnt die somehow.. it shouldnt have...
[08:11] <Jager> in gpart it shows my windows partition as NTFS 56gb out of 68 gb (68 being what I resized it to) and I remeber there was 56gb of data on it
[08:11] <Jager> so its not erased...
[08:11] <sigp239> H3g3m0n: at the very end of the line, just put in "ide=nodma"?  or do I put that in just before the "--" at the end of the line...
[08:12] <H3g3m0n> sigp239: Dunno what the --'s are for, try both :)
[08:12] <H3g3m0n> doubt it matters
[08:12] <sigp239> hrm

[08:14] <flugh> rprp you can drop the v, it's just 'verbose'. i like it though
[08:14] <thenetduck> I found a guy that did it on the message board but don't know how he did it.
[08:15] <Jager> H3g3m0n: First i couldnt boot into windows and when I tried, it would sit there saying "Starting up.... forever
[08:15] <TheGino_Frank> best program to play NSV stream any suggestions
[08:15] <Kingsqueak> thenetduck: look for packages related to 'sane' and install 'xsane' as well
[08:15] <LjL> thenetduck: what scanner? support for many scanners is built in. you won't have much luck with parallel scanners
[08:15] <Kingsqueak> thenetduck: I don't have instructions really but it 'just worked' for me
[08:15] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Then I went into /boot/grub/menu.lst and changed hd0,0 for windows xp pro to hd1,0
[08:15] <Rprp> Hmm im installing a pluging wor Xchat but still its not running the make file
[08:15] <Rprp> ricky@ricky-desktop:~/irc/xsys-2.0.5$ make
[08:15] <Rprp> bash: make: command not found
[08:15] <Rprp> Whats wrong!?
[08:15] <Jager> H3g3m0n: then it say invalid disk

[08:16] <thenetduck> LjL its an epson stylus cx7800 all in one printer scannner
[08:16] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Well if your windows is the 1st partition and you only have 1 hdd then its hd0,0
[08:16] <Jager> H3g3m0n: so i changed it to hd0,1 and now it says "Invalid or unsupported executable format"
[08:16] <ActivE_UK> H3g3m0n that was what it was originally i think
[08:16] <Jager> oh
[08:16] <FFForever> how do i change my boot screen?
[08:16] <Rprp> aha ok thnx
[08:16] <dRk_sHd0w> hey guys is there any other way to move files to usr/local/src ect without the terminal??
[08:16] <vnUBUNTU> hi, just activated a folder sharing on xubuntu but I don't see the computer from my windows computer...do I need to activate something?  smbd is running 2 instances
[08:16] <LjL> thenetduck: look at /etc/sane.d/dll.conf - is "epson" commented out? (shouldn't be, just checking)
[08:16] <thenetduck> LjL I want to do what this guy did but don't know how http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286164&highlight=epson+stylus+cx7800
[08:17] <Jager> H3g3m0n: so ill change it back to hd0,0... but then it will sit there saying "Starting up...." forever again
[08:17] <H3g3m0n> Jager: windows can be very temperamental about partition changes, I installed Ubuntu on my parent machine as dual boot, it worked for 2 days then died. I had to reinstall windows and the harddrive had changed from C: to E:
[08:17] <Jager> -_-
[08:17] <TheGino_Frank> dRk_sHd0w, gksudo nautilus
[08:17] <ActivE_UK> he also resised the windows partition which may have damaged it.
[08:17] <Jager> its never booted up windows once for me lol
[08:17] <blanky> Jager, you know if windows is still there? have you tried gnome partition editor
[08:17] <Jager> yea gpart shows ntfs is still there
[08:18] <thenetduck> LjL nope epson isn't commented out. It's there...
[08:18] <Jager> with the same ammount of data i left on it
[08:18] <LjL> thenetduck: start by install libsane-extras , since the epkowa stuff is in there
[08:18] <blanky> so it's grub that's causing the problem right
[08:18] <bobbie__4> may I leave now?
[08:18] <blanky> are you using typical ATA or SATA
[08:18] <thenetduck> LjL ok one sec
[08:18] <FFForever> anyone???
[08:18] <blanky> Jager,
[08:18] <Jager> sata
[08:18] <TGPO> FFForever, what?
[08:18] <H3g3m0n> Jager: It might be worth trying fixmbr/fixboot on the Windows recover console on the install cd, you will have to reinstall the linux bootloader after though and i doubt it would fix the booting but you can check your windows is still ok
[08:18] <blanky> Jager: yeah, my friend had SATA as well
[08:18] <ActivE_UK> it makes no difference i dont think, its stil hd0
[08:18] <ActivE_UK> it is on mine
[08:18] <FFForever> how do i change the boot screen
[08:18] <FFForever> ?
[08:19] <TheGino_Frank> thenetduck, scanner oh my bad thought u were taking screen
[08:19] <blanky> Jager: I know this doesn't help much, but I'm positive it's an SATA problem (not that your SATA is faulty or anything, but grub is getting mixed up, or something)
[08:19] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell FFForever about usplash | FFForever, you have a private message from Ubotu
[08:19] <Jager> :/

[08:19] <Bilange> by any chance, is there anyone using an Acer Laptop with a Broadcom Wifi card? Im kind of stuck now :/
[08:19] <thenetduck> LjL ok that didn't work.
[08:19] <blanky> *cough* dl *cough*

[08:20] <Jager> i lent my burnt windows to a friend :P
[08:20] <Jager> lol
[08:20] <thenetduck> LjL ya
[08:20] <blanky> Jager: get it back or get a 'new' one
[08:20] <TGPO> Jager call your friend up
[08:20] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Does that "Starting up..." message look like its from windows or grub?
[08:20] <Jager> I will.. but downloading at 30kb a sec stinks
[08:20] <Jager> grub..
[08:20] <blanky> Jager: meh
[08:20] <LjL> thenetduck: then edit /etc/sane.d/dll.conf and comment out "epson" - instead, add a new "epkowa" entry
[08:20] <blanky> Jager: you really need windows huh (games), I feel you
[08:20] <Jager> its grub because it says the same thing a second before ubuntu styarts
[08:20] <Jager> Yea.. my bf2 :**
[08:20] <Jager> :(
[08:20] <ActivE_UK> Jager what other lines does it have under the windows xp section?
[08:21] <Jager> in menu.lst?

[08:22] <ActivE_UK> TheGino_Frank that depends whats causin the problem?
[08:22] <blanky> Jager: well, when you are\
[08:22] <blanky> of course
[08:22] <donmoog> blanky: I installed Ubuntu it on 3GB. Something like 5GB would be more comfortable if you can spare that disk space
[08:22] <TheGino_Frank> ActivE_UK, ic
[08:22] <Jager> blanky: DNS problems.. internet access is screwy
[08:22] <LjL> thenetduck: ah wait, scanimage's not installed by default

[08:22] <v4m21> Guys, I can't able to play mp3 songs in ubuntu.
[08:22] <Jager> H3g3m0n:: ok
[08:22] <blanky> donmoog: yeah I know, I've even done it on 2 gigs (my old old 300mhz comp is running server mode 6.06)
[08:22] <blanky> but I need the space
[08:22] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell v4m21 about mpe | v4m21, you have a private message from Ubotu

[08:23] <thenetduck> LjL ok xane didn't work however it did list my scanner...
[08:23] <ActivE_UK> TheGino_Frank do you mean from the windows xp disc?
[08:23] <blanky> if only I had enough money to get some more space :'(
[08:23] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh
[08:23] <Jager> k brb
[08:23] <thenetduck> LjL it said this device `epkowa:libusb:001:002' is a Epson CX7800 flatbed scanner
[08:23] <LjL> thenetduck: that's what scanimage said, or what xsane said?
[08:23] <donmoog> blanky: Yeah, the Ubuntu desktop CD goes a bit funny on 2GB, you have to remove some files mid-install to let the installer finish!
[08:23] <v4m21> I can't apt-get to install required packages from internet.
[08:23] <blanky> donmoog: hahahaha
[08:23] <TheGino_Frank> ActivE_UK,  no he can d/l for free at www.bootdisk.com if he has no cd he needs boot98 disk
[08:23] <LjL> v4m21: why?
[08:24] <thenetduck> LjL thats what scaneimage said
[08:24] <blanky> donmoog: yeah back in the old days you could do it on 2 gigs, now you needa do server mode install on that
[08:24] <blanky> with xubuntu haha
[08:24] <v4m21> Simply because ISP client is specific to windows.] 
[08:24] <blanky> ultra bare minimum
[08:24] <blanky> then hope you have enough left to actually DO something
[08:24] <v4m21> So  I want to know if anybody knows any packages which support mp3 playing.
[08:24] <LjL> thenetduck: i see. does "sudo scanimage >test.tif" scan and give you a valid tiff image?
[08:24] <v4m21> so that I can downlaod them in windows and then reboot into ubuntu and install them.
[08:25] <dmnd> how do i find out if xfce in 6.10 is compiled with the composite flag? i do not have the option composite in the window manager tweaks.... :(
[08:25] <blanky> !tell v4m21 about mp3
[08:25] <LjL> v4m21: the needed packages are mentioned on the page the bot gave you
[08:25] <masterninja> can i make my download folder a software source or must it be on a server?
[08:25] <blanky> did you get the message, v4m21 ?
[08:25] <sloncho> !help mp3
[08:25] <LjL> v4m21: to get them from Windows, you can use http://packages.ubuntu.com

[08:25] <LjL> v4m21: note, however, that you'll have to sort out the dependencies manually
[08:25] <v4m21> But what about the dependencies.
[08:25] <blanky> v4m21: did you get the message
[08:25] <masterninja> can i make my download folder a software source or must it be on a server?
[08:25] <blanky> LjL: yeah that's a pain
[08:25] <PingunZ> What package do I need to use pixmap engines for GTK2 themes
[08:25] <kitche> dmnd: check your log should say if composite is enabled
[08:26] <v4m21> Ica n't reboot into windows to just to download the dependencies.
[08:26] <thenetduck> LjL sweet, well something happend, but I didn't get an image from it, I heard my scanner turn on and do something
[08:26] <LjL> v4m21, blanky: an alternative could be using apt-zip, but that has to be downloaded as well
[08:26] <blanky> v4m21: ljl told me about http://packages.ubuntu.org and apt-zip back when I was on 56k (like last weekend haha)
[08:26] <v4m21> Yes I got the url http://packages.ubuntu.com/

[08:27] <sloncho> v4m21: why so? modem?
[08:27] <donmoog> v4m21: libmad0 is what you want
[08:27] <ineedehelp> Ok, I bought a USB hub (I use a lot of USB devices). I can't get it to work with ubuntu.....how do I install it?
[08:27] <blanky> v4m21: for zip-slack to work you'll need to be on another ubuntu/deb-based machine
[08:27] <thenetduck> LjL sweet that worked
[08:27] <johny> no it doesn't come with 2.0, does it?
[08:27] <kitche> v4m21: what's your ISP? sicne most ISP's onyl send the software but it's not really needed
[08:27] <donmoog> v4m21: It depends on libc6 (which you will almost certainly have already :-))
[08:27] <kitche> johny: FF 2.0 is in dapper-backports
[08:27] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell prophet about xinerama | prophet, you have a private message from Ubotu
[08:28] <johny> kitche: What are backports?
[08:28] <LjL> thenetduck: ok, i suspect it is a problem with some permissions. hold on a second
[08:28] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell johny about backports | johny, you have a private message from Ubotu
[08:28] <v4m21> nope I am using motoming as my modem and I have to use motorola phone tools to access intenet net, so that client is specific to windows.
[08:29] <donmoog> v4m21: At least, it's libmad0 for Edgy - I should have made the distinction.
[08:29] <v4m21> so installing libmad0 should solve the problem ?
[08:29] <LjL> thenetduck: try this... edit /etc/sane.d/net.conf, and uncomment "localhost"
[08:30] <donmoog> v4m21: I can't guarantee it, but I think so :-)
[08:30] <v4m21> k, let me see guys.

[08:31] <blanky> matason: what?
[08:31] <thenetduck> LjL I mean when I just do a normal xsane it didn't detect my scanner after uncommenting it

[08:32] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: how did you find it?
[08:32] <blanky> matason: because I remember (back in beta) that an update made you lose sound due to some conflict but it was fixed with another update
[08:32] <blanky> matason: so try the updates, but don't get your hopes up too high
[08:32] <LjL> thenetduck: ok, then comment it out again, and try this instead: sudo chmod g+rw /proc/bus/usb/001/00* ; sudo chown root:scanner /proc/bus/usb/001/00*
[08:32] <LjL> thenetduck: but even if this works, it isn't a permanent solution

[08:34] <unimatrix9> are there different versions of the intersil wireless chipsets?
[08:34] <sobersabre> sorry bye
[08:34] <LjL> thenetduck: ok, see, i don't really have a permanent solution. try adding the above command (without the "sudo"es, though) to /etc/rc.local - not sure that'll work, though

[08:37] <DralaFi> DralaFi Hi. I decided to upgrade the kernel, and also got rid of the initrd. I copied the udev, hal and dbus scripts from initrd and I do believe that they are all running, but now I don't get the Windows-XP-like popup window in KDE when I plug in USB storage devices.
[08:37] <DralaFi> DralaFi Can anyone help?
[08:37] <DralaFi> DralaFi can someone please explain to me what this local-top, local-bottom scripts are for in the initrd?
[08:37] <Jager> >_< i cant get windows to boot.. and i cant get on the internet on ubuntu.. my computer is useless
[08:37] <aSt3raL_> i have a usb driver for one of those x10 controllers but it was for an old version of the 2.6 kernel
[08:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Just check the device next to /
[08:38] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Theres many things with / lol
[08:38] <jkelly2005> blanky: no, adobe hasnt released a flash plugin for the ppc architecture.
[08:38] <donmoog> Jager: Is it just Firefox that is not working on the internet?
[08:38] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: looks like rt73 is a usb wlan card, so it should appear in lsusb
[08:38] <whta> is there any way to add zsnes as a synaptic package? :o
[08:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: It should be a / by itself, probally the first one

=== gustavo is now known as suricate
[08:38] <rausb0> dragonfyre13: (not necessarily as ralink)
[08:38] <aSt3raL_> i guess the usb_driver_class struct changed at some point in the 2.6 kernel
[08:39] <Jager> donmoog: its strange.. i can get to google by using their IP.. but not by typing www.google.com and i know i have my DNS servers correct
[08:39] <ActivE_UK> Jager u need to set your DNS servers manually.
[08:39] <dragonfyre13> rausb0: alright, thanks. I'll check there when I need to then.

[08:39] <blanky> TheGino_Frank: does it?
[08:39] <donmoog> Jager: Ok, how about if you wget http://google.com/ - from a command line, does this work?
[08:39] <TheGino_Frank> blanky, dont know was asking you lol
[08:39] <unimatrix9> winamp - use beep-mediaplayer ,a look a like
[08:39] <blanky> TheGino_Frank: I doubt it but there's always wine ( http://www.winehq.org )
[08:39] <prophet> i fallowed that guide but now when i turn on my computer both monitors show the same thing
[08:40] <blanky> TheGino_Frank: but I suggest just using a native player
[08:40] <LjL> XMMS looks much like WinAmp
[08:40] <masterninja> i installed wine with synaptic will it just run windows programs now because no new icons have appeard on my start menu
[08:40] <unimatrix9> and use winamp , classic skins
[08:40] <TheGino_Frank> blanky, oh yea wine :0! D'oh
[08:40] <apokryphos> ubotu: players
[08:40] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[08:40] <jkelly2005> blanky: yeah. ppc is mac. its very inconvenient. mplayer actually played the flv files with no problems in dapper. i dont see what could have changed in mplayer for it to not work anymore.
[08:40] <blanky> TheGino_Frank: don't get your hopes up though
[08:40] <blanky> jkelly2005: hold on a sec for me
[08:40] <H3g3m0n> TheGino_Frank: There was a version of Winamp for Linux ages ago, but it was scrapped and very crap
[08:40] <unimatrix9> beep-mediaplayer us nicer then xmms, but its just the taste
[08:40] <thenetduck> LjL ok here's the pastebin
[08:40] <LjL> masterninja: icons usually do appear here. if they don't, anyway type "wine programfile.exe" - you'll find the Wine "virtual drive" inside the ~/.wine directory

[08:44] <ljlolel> ?
[08:44] <Jager> ActivE_UK: Yes
[08:44] <Jager> I can ping everything from console.. and always get something returned
[08:45] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Well it sounds like your external bumped the drive order around, if you only have 1 harddrive it should be hda not hdb, unless your cdrom is plugged into the wrong channel or something

[08:45] <yuheng108> does anyone know how to use irc if the the irc ports are blocked?
[08:45] <donmoog> Jager: Sorry, I should have been more clear. Open a terminal/console. Type "wget http://google.com -O -" at the command line, and see if you get any output.
[08:45] <Jager> h3g3m0n: should I change it to hda and reboot then?
[08:45] <LjL> yuheng108: there are web gateways around
[08:45] <donmoog> Jager: wget basically downloads a t
[08:45] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Probally not
[08:46] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Try booting without the external plugged in
[08:46] <donmoog> Jager: wget basically downloads a URL, so it's a quick way of finding if you have network connectiviity (other than ping)
[08:46] <Jager> H3g3m0n: it hasent been plugged ino -_-
[08:46] <Jager> donmoog: okay
[08:46] <ActivE_UK> he can connect to the web via an ip i think

[08:48] <MasterShrek> bill57785 when ur at ur login screen change the session to kde
[08:48] <blanky> bill57785: when you're logging in, choose the 'choose session' or something like that
[08:48] <kitche> whta: look at your repos in synaptic should have multiverse option in there
[08:48] <bill57785> sweet, thanks
[08:48] <MasterShrek> c00i90wn i would say u just need to change ur repos
[08:49] <grimboy> carp3, You won't loose any from official repos as long as you don't reinstall and just upgrade.
[08:49] <ActivE_UK> if its sata shouldnt it be sda?
[08:49] <MasterShrek> yes ActivE_UK

[08:50] <unimatrix9> nice games?
[08:50] <jkelly2005> blanky: well, not well. the restricted formats page doesnt really have any good information for ppc users wishing to play flash video. there is one method i could use. gnash. which is a gpl library for playing flash video but i dont think its mature enough yet to play back files correctly. ive heard that they've made a lot of progress though. i might just file a bug in mplayer.
[08:50] <carp3> grimboy : and now i don't have .package file
[08:50] <grimboy> carp3, Hmm... I don't know if you'll loose them. They're usually statically compiled.
[08:50] <donmoog> Hexidigital_: What output do you get?
[08:50] <Hexidigital_> donmoog: one sec, i'll pastebin it
[08:50] <grimboy> carp3, So they don't have any dependencies on particular library versions.
[08:51] <blanky> jkelly2005: yeah, and what can it hurt to try gnash? oh so you already looked at the RF page, and CTRL+F'ed ppc right?

[08:56] <blanky> skyfaller: no problem, you won't. the boot loader will probably be replaced but that's not a problem, it should recognize windows
[08:56] <DanaG> hmm,
[08:56] <donmoog> Jager: Ok. From the command line can you do this: host http://google.com. Obviously something's broke with your DNS, but we have to find out where...

[08:56] <blanky> skyfaller: are you doing desktop install (the live installer thing)
[08:57] <skyfaller> blanky: I just want to use the existing yoper partition?
[08:57] <ljlolel> the the -generic kernel include support for dual cores (takes advantage fo dual cores) ?
[08:57] <ciplogic> (I have ubuntu edgy)
[08:57] <DanaG> murph2481: are you using NetworkManager?
[08:57] <Hexidigital> donmoog: quick question... do i have to add /sbin/iptables throughout the entire command, or just the beginning?
[08:57] <skyfaller> blanky: yeah, it's the live CD
[08:57] <syntaxx> where's the location of the wallpaper files?
[08:57] <DanaG> If so, go to a console, then sudo killall NetworkManager and NetworkManagerDispatcher
[08:57] <blanky> skyfaller: if so, go to System > Administration > Gnome Parition Editor, delete the yoper partitions (everything except NTFS or FAT/FAT32), and then when you install choose to install using the largest continuous free space
[08:57] <lifepositive> good morning everyone :)
[08:57] <blanky> skyfaller: taht way, it'll do the partitioning for you

[08:59] <blanky> skyfaller: now, do you see the partitions; ntfs, ext3/ext2/reiserfs (whichever), swap, etc.?
[08:59] <Jager> donmoog: Host http://google.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
[08:59] <bariel> anyone encounter that problem also?
[08:59] <ciplogic> there is a way to install Ubuntu edgy from textmode ?
[08:59] <skyfaller> blanky: OK, great :)  Yes, hda1 is fat32 and then we have hda2 extended partition with some reiserfs partitions and a swap partition inside of it
[08:59] <ciplogic> lately to fixup the xorg?
[08:59] <matsur> ciplogic, are you asking how to upgrade from the console?
[09:00] <Hexidigital> ciplogic: downloading an alternative cd will allow a text mode install
[09:00] <donmoog> Hexidigital: Ah, the problem is that the root user hasn't got /sbin/ in it's path. There are two options... either change all instances of iptables to /sbin/iptables, or you can edit your /etc/profile and add /sbin/ into the path
[09:00] <blanky> skyfaller: ah okay, delete everything other than the fat32 (in other words, everything other than windows)
[09:00] <blanky> skyfaller: do that by right clicking > delete
[09:00] <ciplogic> Hexidigital: thank you!
[09:00] <H3g3m0n> DreamerHxC: Tried apg-get install ubuntu-desktop from inside kubuntu and choosing your session as a gnome on on login?
[09:00] <Hexidigital> donmoog: i think /sbin/iptables will be easier :) thaks
[09:00] <Hexidigital> ciplogic: np
[09:00] <Hexidigital> be back
[09:00] <ciplogic> rebooting, and thanks for help :)
[09:00] <Jager> H3g3m0n: i type dmeg | grephda??
[09:01] <carp3> bye all ...
[09:01] <skyfaller> blanky: OK, thank you :) Um, what about the extended partition?  do I delete that too, or just the partitions inside of it?
[09:01] <Jager> H3g3m0n: dmesg | grephda **
[09:01] <johny> what usually causes this error to appear? - E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[09:01] <donmoog> Jager: Can you do 'nslookup google.com' from a command line. and tell us what the Server: address is?
[09:01] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh and grep hdb, check what drives show up
[09:01] <blanky> skyfaller:
[09:01] <blanky> er
[09:01] <Jager> k
[09:01] <whta> how can I make zsnes accessible from the games menu?
[09:01] <blanky> skyfaller: one of them won't let you delete it until you delete the other
[09:02] <blanky> skyfaller: delete EVERYTHING other than windows (which is fat32 i think)
[09:02] <skyfaller> blanky: right, OK
[09:02] <blanky> skyfaller: so you deleted everything?
[09:02] <skyfaller> blanky: OK, I've done that... to be clear, I'm using gparted from within the installer
[09:03] <blanky> skyfaller: understood
[09:03] <skyfaller> blanky: so I've got 12 GB of unallocated space now
[09:03] <admin_> hello,
[09:03] <blanky> then once you're done doing that, click on the 'apply' button, it'll start applying the delete process
[09:03] <skyfaller> blanky: I don't think there is an apply button... I just see "forward"
[09:03] <donmoog> Jager: I suspect that you haven't got your DNS servers set up in the /etc/resolv.conf file. You will need to edit this file as root (sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf). If there is no line starting with "nameserver", you will need to add in a line e.g. "nameserver 1.2.3.4" (without the quotes, where 1.2.3.4 is your DNS server IP address)
[09:03] <admin_> How do i kill X so i'm just left with tty*? Becuase if i try to kill X, it will just restart and come up with the Ubuntu login screen
[09:03] <whta> how can I make zsnes accessible from the games menu?
[09:04] <blanky> skyfaller: you're sure there's no apply button? a check mark?
[09:04] <donmoog> Jager: There's also a way to add it through the GUI if you're more comfortable with that...
[09:04] <polpak> admin_: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[09:04] <blanky> skyfaller: can you take a screenshot of it and put it on http://www.imageshack.us ?
[09:04] <skyfaller> blanky: um, I think so... I don't know how to take screenshots in Ubuntu
[09:04] <admin_> polpak: thanks
[09:04] <blanky> skyfaller: there should be a camera icon somewhere
[09:04] <helpmeplease> ok, I am still having trouble getting kubuntu-desktop to install
[09:04] <blanky> skyfaller: in the toolbar at the top, or the menus
[09:05] <blanky> taht say 'take screenshot' or something like htat
[09:05] <skyfaller> blanky: ok, found it in "accessories"
[09:05] <whta> how can I make zsnes accessible from the games menu?
[09:06] <Hexidigital> donmoog: thanks!  changing all instances of iptables to /sbin/iptables worked like a charm!
[09:06] <ephemeros> . \m/
[09:06] <blanky> skyfaller: okay so now take a picture, and then upload it on http://www.imageshack.us
[09:06] <DeeTahPanLtah> guys ive made a terrible mistake:before going away i forgot to turn on sshd and  ive got only smtp and pop3 open is there any way to get in?
[09:06] <donmoog> whta: Click the menu System->Preferences->Menu Layout. From here, you can add an item in your applications menu.
[09:06] <donmoog> Hexidigital: No problemo, glad I could help :-)
[09:06] <Hexidigital> back to my mythtv problems :)  bye!
[09:06] <H3g3m0n> DeeTahPanLtah: Not unless you can discover an exploit in sendmail :)
[09:06] <DreamerHxC> [H3g3m0n]  I didn't try it, but I don't like Kubuntu
[09:07] <DeeTahPanLtah> fat chance ;<
[09:07] <whta> donmoog: do i have to make a custom icon to start zsnes?
[09:07] <DreamerHxC> it's must be a bug -> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/67487
[09:07] <whta> custom item, rather
[09:07] <donmoog> whta: Yes - click "New Item"
[09:07] <H3g3m0n> DreamerHxC: I think Kubuntu with ubuntu-desktop installed would basically be normal Ubuntu
[09:07] <donmoog> Then type in the name, and specify the command that you would run to start zsnes
[09:08] <whta> donmoog: ok, just need the command to launch zsnes then
[09:08] <barteeeeek> how i can play movies in format .vcd (sorry for my english)
[09:08] <skyfaller> blanky: OK, I got it up on my flickr
[09:08] <Doow> barteeeeek: not sure, but vlc plays most everything
[09:08] <blanky> skyfaller: oh okay, what's the link
[09:08] <skyfaller> http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyfaller/305918345/
[09:08] <DreamerHxC> [H3g3m0n]  but with same packages and command orders?
[09:09] <blanky> skyfaller: hold up a sec
[09:09] <donmoog> whta: Do you want to double check that it hasn't added itself in the Applications->Games menu?
[09:09] <whta> donmoog: the last entry is tetravex.
[09:09] <Jager> h3gem0n: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33962/
[09:09] <H3g3m0n> DreamerHxC: I think it would install all the packages it needs, the splash screen and login might still be diffrent etc
[09:10] <donmoog> whta: Fair enough, do you know what the command is to launch zsnes?
[09:10] <H3g3m0n> Jager: And hda returned nothing?
[09:10] <blanky> skyfaller: hold up a sec for me man
[09:10] <whta> donmoog: nope, trying to figure it out but I sure wouldn't mind assistance
=== barteeeeeek is now known as bartus
[09:10] <blanky> the image is so small lol you should've uplaoded it to imageshack.us
[09:10] <skyfaller> blanky: no prob, thanks for the help :)
[09:10] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Ive no clue
[09:10] <DreamerHxC> ok i'll try then
[09:10] <skyfaller> blanky: go to "all sizes"?
[09:11] <johny> can sameone tell me: what usually causes this error to appear? - " dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem".
[09:11] <blanky> skyfaller: ah I see hehe
[09:11] <skyfaller> blanky: http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=305918345&size=o
[09:11] <Doow> whta: dunno if you got documentation installed, but if you did, you could always try 'apropos zsnes'
[09:11] <donmoog> whta: Ok, if you open up a terminal (click Applications->Accessories->Terminal). If you can find the command out from here, you can use that same command for hte menu item. Try "zsnes" hehe.
[09:11] <blanky> skyfaller: hover your mouse over various buttons and see if any of them say 'apply', 'confirm', or anything like that
[09:11] <whta> donmoog: oh hey, that was simple
[09:12] <Jager> donmoog: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33963/
[09:12] <donmoog> whta: In the terminal, you can use tab completion. Basically, type "z", then press <tab> twice, it will give you a list of all commands available.
[09:12] <rogue780> !mythtv
[09:12] <ubotu> MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV
[09:12] <skyfaller> blanky: I'm not seeing it... I think the "forward" button is going to function as the "apply" button while you're in the installer
[09:12] <Jager> donmoog: ill do what you said with the nameserver thing
[09:13] <blanky> skyfaller: sure try that, I'm so stupid
[09:13] <skyfaller> blanky: but I haven't set up new partitions
[09:13] <blanky> skyfaller: after you forward, don't do anything, this is crucial that you don't do anything
[09:13] <donmoog> Jager: Ok. Check to see if you have a nameserver item already there first. If you have, don't edit the file.
[09:13] <blanky> skyfaller: it told you that?
[09:13] <Jager> donmoog: okay
[09:13] <skyfaller> blanky: well, the scary message at the bottom there says "Make sure to allocate space for a root partition" etc.
[09:13] <blanky> skyfaller: the point isn't to make new partitions, the point is to delete the partitions, then you're going to go back past the partition editor to where you chose to use the partition editor, but this time choose 'install on largest contious free space'
[09:14] <skyfaller> blanky: ahhhhh!  I see
[09:14] <skyfaller> blanky: I'll try that then
[09:14] <donmoog> Jager: Judging by your last pastebin, you should have a line "nameserver 192.168.0.1".
[09:14] <blanky> skyfaller: if I remember correctly, it won't install yet, it'll just create the partitions, and even if it does install (impossible) it owuldn't do anything to your windows because you haven't modified it yet (i hope)
[09:14] <superlion> hello guys. how do I rest kdewallet password I forgot it.'
[09:14] <skyfaller> blanky: yup, it's working as an apply button
[09:14] <skyfaller> blanky: wow, and it did it fast
[09:14] <whta> unlrelated question now.. when upgrading in the future, will i need to reinstall everything?
[09:14] <blanky> skyfaller: nice, it might take some time, just be patient (it might be fast too)
[09:14] <masterninja> whats better beryl or compiz?
[09:15] <blanky> skyfaller: ah okay, now do what I said and go back past the parititon editor
[09:15] <DanaG> Gaim 2.0 b 5
[09:15] <DanaG> deb  http://repository.debuntu.org/ edgy multiverse
[09:15] <H3g3m0n> masterninja: Beryl has pwdyer effects
[09:15] <blanky> skyfaller: but this time, choose 'install on largest continiuos free space' instead of edit partitions
[09:15] <masterninja> nice
[09:15] <donmoog> whta: You shouldn't need to. Ubuntu provides a (reasonably) smooth upgrade path.
[09:15] <DanaG> http://repository.debuntu.org/
[09:15] <masterninja> beryl it is then
[09:15] <Jager> donmoog: Yes, i have that as well as nameserver 205.171.3.65
[09:15] <blanky> skyfaller: this will tell ubuntu to set up the partitions for you, and it'll leave windows alone and install the bootloader, and everything will be fine :)
[09:16] <Imsdle> O
[09:16] <donmoog> whta: Normally, when a new long-term update gets released, you will get a notification in the top right corner of your screen.
[09:16] <skyfaller> blanky: yay!  OK, I'll try that once it finishes "scanning all devices"
[09:16] <Jager> donmoog: and a line that says "Search domain.actdsltmp" that irrelevant?
[09:16] <blanky> skyfaller: no problem, stay on here if you like, if you have any probs soon
[09:16] <blanky> which you shouldn't have
[09:16] <rogue780> can someone help me get svideo out working with my radeon 7000 under ubuntu?
[09:16] <Imsdle> I'm trying to setup a dail up for my ubuntu.. it dails out and connects only if I disable the network connection.. how can i fix this

[09:22] <DarkY> hi@ =D
[09:22] <bill> what i mean is make it avaliable on start up sign in
[09:22] <H3g3m0n> Jager: /etc/modporbe.d/aliases
[09:22] <Rprp> Hmm is there maybe a other ftp than gFTP? gFTP suck :/

[09:23] <blanky> skyfaller: how's it going?
[09:23] <blanky> skyfaller: is it installing now?
[09:23] <donmoog> Rprp: There is a built in FTP client with Ubuntu. Click Places->Connect to server... and specify FTP. If you're looking for more advanced features however, this probably isn't for you
[09:23] <H3g3m0n> Rprp: Also nautilus will do ftp if you put in the ftp:// address in the location bar
[09:23] <Rprp> Oke, But is there SCP in it?
[09:23] <skyfaller> blanky: well, hitting the back button requires me to go back through gparted, so I have to wait for it to load again >.<
[09:24] <blanky> Rprp: I used to ask the same question, and when people told me to just use the built in FTP, I ignored it, but it's really good, especially KDE's. So use either konquerer (kde) or nautilus (gnome)
[09:24] <skyfaller> which means another 5-10 minutes of looking at a progress bar
[09:24] <blanky> skyfaller: oohh, haha
[09:24] <bill> to sign in as admin and make it always avalibale
[09:24] <donmoog> Rprp: Ubuntu also does SCP in exactly the same was as with FTP. Just specify SSH instead of FTP.
[09:24] <DarkY> people... since i've started windows by boot loader.. ubuntu 6.10 loads with shell... help me please :/
[09:24] <blanky> skyfaller: don't worry, after that, all'll be fine
[09:24] <Rprp> gFTP is slow :/
[09:24] <H3g3m0n> Rrrp: ssh://server in nautilus does file transfers over ssh
[09:24] <skyfaller> actually, I lied, there's no progress bar this time, just an empty gparted window

[09:25] <blanky> Rprp: they already told you, use the built in ftp
[09:25] <H3g3m0n> Rprp: scp != ftp, scp is a slow protocol because its encrypted heavily etc
[09:25] <Rprp> And if i type a beginletter of a file in gFTP its not going to that file :/
[09:25] <Endyrion> hello whow do i get wireless to run under wpa ????
[09:25] <DarkY> blanky: :?
[09:25] <donmoog> Endyrion: Install the package "wpasupplicant" through Synaptic.
[09:26] <Endyrion> tanks is that all ???
[09:26] <blanky> DarkY: sorry, ask again they might see your qustion this time
[09:26] <DarkY> people... since i've started windows by boot loader.. ubuntu 6.10 loads with shell... help me please :/
[09:26] <donmoog> Endyrion: That installs the driver, at least
[09:26] <Endyrion> thanks
[09:26] <LjL> yuheng108: sorry, i was away for dinner. search for "cgi irc" on google, you'll find a few
[09:26] <donmoog> Endyrion: I would also install network-manager-gnome as well, as it makes network stuff much easier to configure.
[09:27] <DarkY> i know loading windows is stupid but i had to... cause i needed access to wlan and i havent configured wlan in ubuntu since yet ^^
[09:27] <kitche> DarkY: what run level is ubuntu booting up to most likely it's probably on 3 since it boots up to the shell
[09:27] <yuheng108> LjL, oic, thanks
[09:27] <donmoog> Endyrion: But if you choose to install that, you will also need to edit one file, as a one off.
[09:27] <DarkY> how can i check this kitche?
[09:27] <Tau_> q
[09:28] <Endyrion> donmoog what file will i need to edit ???
[09:28] <Rprp> Hmmm oke thnx for all
[09:28] <DarkY> kitche: how could i check this? :/
[09:28] <donmoog> Endyrion: you will need to edit the file /etc/network/interfaces as root.

[09:31] <Jasey> hey there. im having a bit of trouble mounting my floppy disk. i know its all connected properly because i can run boot disks. but i keep getting this when trying to mount. mount: /dev/fd0 is not a valid block device... what can i do? thank you :)
[09:31] <DarkY> kitche: i logged in as root and /etc/inittab shows: permission denied o
[09:31] <kitche> DarkY: you in fail safe mode? or did you enable root log in
[09:31] <kitche> DarkY: check the perms do ls -l /etc/inittab
[09:31] <cmweb> thank you again ljl
[09:31] <ompaul> Jasey, install mtools and do mdir and mcopy if you want to use them or mount -t mdos /media/floppy
[09:32] <RiGLEY> Can somebody send me the default ubuntu edgy wallpaper? Please! I can't find it on the net..
[09:32] <DarkY> kitche: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2008 2006-05-23 10:39 /etc/inittab
[09:32] <Jasey> ok, ill try it
[09:32] <polpak> Jasey: is it formatted?
[09:32] <ompaul> Jasey, or -t msdos  even
[09:32] <Jasey> of course it is,how can you have a non formatted boot disk lol
[09:32] <DarkY> kitche: and i started the normal way but he just accepts root login without password
[09:32] <ompaul> Jasey, so then you should take a look in /etc/fstab and check out how the mount command works
[09:33] <LjL> RiGLEY: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/gnome/ubuntu-artwork
[09:33] <polpak> Jasey: You didn't say the disk was a boot disk. You only said that you could "run boot disks" in that drive
[09:33] <kitche> DarkY: ok that is odd that it would say permission denied how are you trying to open it?
[09:33] <RiGLEY> thanks LjL
[09:34] <Jasey> i know how to mount, thank you. and i thought it was somewhat obvious that the disk im testing with was a boot disk, thus properly formatted. sorry.
[09:34] <DarkY> kitche: lol i tried to execute.. sorry i'll open it now ^^ ... im a little bit tired atm ^^
[09:34] <vnUBUNTU> hi, uh...when I log from windows to a samba sharing computer...and its asking me to login.  what informations am I suposed to enter?
[09:34] <whta> MAN i'm just getting problem after problem
[09:34] <DarkY> kitche: id:2:initdefault:
[09:34] <Jager> H3g3m0n: editing /esc/modprobe.d/aliases didnt fix it
[09:34] <Jasey> polpak, ompaul: anyway, i installed that package and it still complains mount: /dev/fd0 is not a valid block device
[09:35] <kitche> DarkY: ah ok so it is setup to boot to shell it seems
[09:35] <H3g3m0n> Jager: 'lsmod | grep ipv6' see if it still got loaded somehow
[09:35] <whta> whenever i choose to log out or i press ctrl+alt+backspace the system just sort of blacks out and I can't bring it back. i need to do this quite a bit because often my system will start up with no sound and the only way to fix it is to restart. and that gets tedious =\
[09:35] <bimberi> vnUBUNTU: you need to set up a samba password: 'sudo smbpasswd -a username'
[09:35] <DarkY> kitche: k how can i repair this? :/
[09:35] <bimberi> ubotu: tell samba about vnUBUNTU | via /msg
[09:35] <vnUBUNTU> kthx
[09:35] <ompaul> Jasey, so, what kind of a boot disk is it?
[09:35] <bimberi> ubotu: tell vnUBUNTU about samba | via /msg
[09:35] <H3g3m0n> Jager: If you got nothing then ipv6 isn't loaded
[09:35] <bill> what is that web site for root password
[09:35] <bimberi> oops
[09:36] <Jager> k
[09:36] <vnUBUNTU> got it
[09:36] <vnUBUNTU> :p
[09:36] <Jasey> ompaul: just a windows 98 boot disk. i want some files off it to send to someone.
[09:36] <bill> help
[09:36] <Kingsqueak> bimberi: 'sudo -i'  then type your own password
[09:36] <Kingsqueak> gah, nick completion
[09:36] <Kingsqueak> bill: 'sudo -i' then type your own password
[09:36] <LjL> bimberi: are you trying to copy my alias? >:
[09:36] <whta> whenever i choose to log out or i press ctrl+alt+backspace the system just sort of blacks out and I can't bring it back. i need to do this quite a bit because often my system will start up with no sound and the only way to fix it is to restart. and that gets tedious
[09:36] <ompaul> Jasey, so mdir in a terminal should show what is in there
[09:37] <bill> the web site where it tells me how to set pass word for root
[09:37] <Jager> H3g3m0n: this is what it returned: "ipv6     272288   8"
[09:37] <Kingsqueak> bill there isn't one, you use sudo in Ubuntu
[09:37] <LjL> bill: why would you need to do that?
[09:37] <bimberi> LjL: yep, with a python macro :)
[09:37] <ompaul> selinuxium, evening
[09:37] <Jasey> ompaul: now it says Can't open /dev/fd0: No such device or address. but there is definitely a device fd0 in /dev.
[09:37] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Did you reboot after changing the file? also try 'rm ipv6'
[09:37] <blanky> hey guys
[09:37] <ompaul> Jasey, what version of ubuntu are you using?
[09:37] <blanky> in irc, how do you change the motd of a channel?
[09:37] <Jager> h3g3mon: Yea, i did.
[09:38] <Jasey> ompaul: edgy
[09:38] <vnUBUNTU> yay it works
[09:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: 'rmmod ipv6'
[09:38] <vnUBUNTU> thx
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> blanky: it's /topic
[09:38] <DarkY> kitche: still alive? ^^
[09:38] <selinuxium> ompaul: Indeed it is! How goes it?
[09:38] <vnUBUNTU> was the smbpasswd thing
[09:38] <vnUBUNTU> lol
[09:38] <whta> whenever i choose to log out or i press ctrl+alt+backspace the system just sort of blacks out and I can't bring it back. i need to do this quite a bit because often my system will start up with no sound and the only way to fix it is to restart. and that gets tedious
[09:38] <blanky> Kingsqueak: oohhh thanks!
[09:38] <Jager> man this is frustrating.. all this just to get my internet working :/
=== rmbl`off is now known as rmbl
[09:38] <omV0> Hi, my ubuntu menu crashed and closed.. what is the command to reopen it?
[09:38] <bill> because i want to set up some things
[09:38] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Actualyl rmmod wont work
[09:38] <LjL> bill: oooh, good reason. not. use sudo. ;)
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> bill: 'sudo -i'  then type your password....how hard is that?
[09:39] <ompaul> Jasey, do this in the terminal >> mount | grep flo<< and tell me if it gives a response
[09:39] <thirstyferret> Evening, all... Can anyone recommend a good MSN client please? I tried amsn, but didn't get on too well with it - are there any alternatives? Thanks :)
[09:39] <bimberi> omV0: which menu? "Applications Places System"?
[09:39] <kitche> DarkY: hmm wonder if your gdm script got turned off but it seems odd that you can log in as root since it should be locked unless your in "rescue mode"
[09:39] <bill> never mind
[09:39] <LjL> thirstyferret: Gaim
[09:39] <Jasey> ompaul: nothing. by the way, i dont have any /dev/floppy as many ppl do have, ive seen
[09:40] <thirstyferret> LjL: thanks - will give it a shot and report back

[09:40] <ompaul> Jasey, put this in your /etc/fstab >> /dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0<<
[09:40] <DarkY> kitche: i dont want to set it up again <.< can i do anything?
[09:40] <omV0> bimberi: yeah, i already got it back with "gnome-panel" but thanks =)
[09:40] <DarkY> kitche: just starting it the normal way and get into shell <.<
[09:40] <bimberi> omV0: righto :)
[09:40] <Jasey> i already have that in fstab
[09:41] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Looks like there may be a new firmware for my router that fixes this :)
[09:41] <H3g3m0n> Jager: Yeh i think they released somthing for my dlink, but i installed openwrt linux on it
[09:41] <DarkY> kitche: if i do /etc/init.d/rc 2 i get errror at [* Starting system log....]  and at [* Starting kernel log...] 
[09:41] <Jasey> ompaul: ive already got that. i even mkdir'd my own floppy0 folder. nothing
[09:42] <asfalt> hello, i have a slight problem with gnome not coming up after login, i was in a session and my wallpaper dissappeared, i logged out and now when i attempt to login i get a gray box in upper left hand side corner, when pointer floats over it changes to textbar. there is no error msg that i can see on the screen. in failsafe terminal i renamed .gnome2 and .gconf dirs in my home dir as well but still have the problem
[09:42] <Jager> H3g3m0n: Arg... some people say not to upgrade the firmware.. that it might mess up the router.. ahh i was not meant to have linux lol
[09:42] <H3g3m0n> Jager: just make sure your file looks the same as the screenshot here: http://computeraddict.neo-addict.net/guides/tut_ubuntudisableipv6
[09:43] <ompaul> Jasey, you have to check what you already said: <Jasey> ompaul: nothing. by the way, i dont have any /dev/floppy as many ppl do have, ive seen << if you are on edgy mkdir /media/floppy is not bad but floppy0 is not needed
[09:43] <donmoog> Jager: Before going down that route, I would personally try the easy option - comment out the 192.168.0.1 /etc/resolv.conf line, by putting a # at the start of it.
[09:43] <Jager> donmoog: ok, ill try it
[09:44] <Beforewisdom> Hi.  Does anyone here download BSG( I don't own a TV)?   I've been trying to, but all I can get are avi files, which don't play on ubuntu no matter what I try ( totem, xine, vlc, mplayer, mplayer codecs ).
[09:44] <asfalt> also when i try to run 'gnome session" from the failsafe terminal i get the gray box in upper left hand side corner of the screen
[09:44] <donmoog> Jager, you'll need to edit the file as root so e.g. sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
[09:44] <H3g3m0n> I think resolv.conf gets overridden by dhcp though so it will break again at reboot
[09:44] <kitche> DarkY: look at /var/log/dmesg might help you out a bit with finding whta happened
[09:44] <Jager> yea
[09:44] <H3g3m0n> but worth trying for testing
[09:44] <Jasey> ompaul: well whichever, theyre just mountpoints anyway. either way, before i was trying to access my disk, /media didnt have any mountpoint folders pertaining to a floppy disk device.
[09:45] <Jasey> anyway, ive got to go
[09:45] <bcroq> hi all
[09:45] <aSt3raL_> what package is ncftpget in?
[09:45] <Jager> Well, if i tell it not to do dhcp and to do static.. will dhcp still over write the reolv.conf?
[09:45] <donmoog> H3g3m0n: Indeed. You can edit the dhclient.conf file to ignore the dhcp supplied DNS entries. It's a simple fix if it works. Do you think it'd be easier than disabling IPv6?
[09:45] <Jasey> thanks for your help ompaul
[09:45] <ompaul> Jasey, then it looks like your ubuntu did not see your hardware as it installed - strange - check launchpad for bugs reported on that
[09:45] <LjL> !find ncftpget | aSt3raL_
[09:45] <ubotu> File ncftpget found in ncftp
[09:45] <donmoog> Jager: If you use static, then DHCP wont touch your setup, so that is certainly an option.
[09:45] <bcroq> on my computer, lspci doesn't output anything... is it a known problem ? (Edgy)
[09:47] <Beforewisdom> Hi.  Does anyone here download BSG( I don't own a TV)?   I've been trying to, but all I can get are avi files, which don't play on ubuntu no matter what I try ( totem, xine, vlc, mplayer, mplayer codecs ).
[09:47] <Firefishe> Hi folks. :)  Is there any way to invoke apt-get to install both Recommended and Suggested package selections?
[09:47] <H3g3m0n> donmoog: Probably not much difference between the 2
[09:47] <thirstyferret> LkL: Gaim looks great, thanks :)
[09:47] <LjL> Firefishe: not sure, there's probably a config file option. or you could use aptitude, that installs recommends by default, and suggests if you give it the option
[09:48] <sohlemac> Beforewisdom, how are the avi files encoded?
[09:48] <H3g3m0n> although having ipv6 enabled can apparently slow down ipv4
[09:48] <LjL> !aptitude | Firefishe
[09:48] <ubotu> Firefishe: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[09:48] <donmoog> H3g3m0n: Yeah, just read it on that article. I think that may be a bit misleading. I don't really see how it would slow things down...
[09:48] <Beforewisdom> sohlemac, I'm a noob to media, I don't know what that means, I thought avi was the encoding
[09:48] <trilly> hi
[09:48] <kitche> H3g3m0n: yes ipv6 will slow down ipv4 if that's all you have I usually turn ipv6 off in firefox and it speeds up great
[09:48] <sohlemac> avi is a container.
[09:49] <nacho_> Hi: How can i control by software the LCD brightness of my acer laptop? what's the command for do that?
[09:49] <Beforewisdom> sohlemac, I read that
[09:49] <kitche> donmoog:it looks for ipv6 stuff first in firefox then ipv4
[09:49] <sohlemac> Beforewisdom, I would suggest automatix
[09:49] <Firefishe> LjL:  apitude!  Knew I was forgetting something.  Is aptitude safe for ubuntu?
[09:49] <donmoog> H3g3m0n: For example, if you do a lookup on google.com and your ISP only supports IPv4, then you're only going to get a IPv4 IP address back, so IPv6 is dormant.
[09:49] <LjL> Firefishe: should be
[09:49] <LjL> !automatix | sohlemac, Beforewisdom
[09:49] <ubotu> sohlemac, Beforewisdom: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[09:49] <Beforewisdom> sohlemac, I already tried automatix and downloading mplayer codex
[09:49] <davin> how come I cant resize my ubuntu partition? Everything is grayed out in gparted and I cant umount it.
[09:49] <Firefishe> LjL: Don't worry, I won't hold you responsible ;)
[09:49] <sohlemac> hehe
[09:49] <sohlemac> I'll not suggest that then.
[09:49] <sohlemac> (it's what I used)
[09:50] <Beforewisdom> sohlemac,  can anyone suggest a good place to dowloand BSG....preferably not in avi
[09:50] <sohlemac> sorry, I'm not really into BSG.
[09:50] <Beforewisdom> I'm wondering if the place I found just sucks
[09:50] <H3g3m0n> donmoog: Problem is it will still make an ipv6 dns request even if its not supported, might even wait untill the ipv6 one has return that there isn't one befoure doing the ipv4
[09:50] <Vaske_Car> how to burn image .iso in Ubuntu?
[09:50] <sohlemac> !easyubuntu
[09:50] <ubotu> easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[09:51] <bimberi> Vaske_Car: right-click, select Write to Disc
[09:51] <Beforewisdom> Okay, thanks anyway
[09:51] <kitche> H3g3m0n: do you want to know how to turn ipv6 off in firefox?
[09:51] <MrRio> Vaske_Car: right click then 'Write to disc'
[09:51] <donmoog> kitche, H3g3m0n: Same applies. Firefox will only be slower if your DNS server responds with an IPv6 IP address... which most of them wont.
[09:51] <Beforewisdom> Bye
[09:51] <MrRio> bimberi: you beat me!
[09:51] <vnUBUNTU> imho, ubuntu is already too easy to install
[09:51] <davin> I cant seem to resize my ubuntu ext3 partition, everything is grayed out, when I try to umount it it says its busy, and I need help urgently as my partitions are totally screwed up right now and I got 50 mb left in Windows
[09:51] <vnUBUNTU> lol
[09:51] <H3g3m0n> kitche: about:config in the address bar, search for ipv6
[09:51] <Vaske_Car> bimberi, thanks
[09:51] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Vaske_Car about burniso | Vaske_Car, you have a private message from Ubotu
[09:51] <Vaske_Car> MrRio, thanks
[09:51] <vnUBUNTU> I was disappointed, I was expecting soething in the style of debian sarge
[09:51] <kitche> H3g3m0n: yeah I know how to do it myself just wondering if you wanted to turn it off
[09:52] <LjL> !alternate | vnUBUNTU ;-)
[09:52] <ubotu> vnUBUNTU ;-): The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[09:52] <H3g3m0n> nah i did mine awhile ago
[09:52] <[A] ndy80> hi
[09:52] <tortus> I have 2 computers, both running edgy, both having nearly the same applications installed. But one of them asks for updates few times a week, the hardly ever. How can that be?
[09:53] <H3g3m0n> I wounder if IPv6 will ever actually get widespread use, theres global NAT and other stuff around so it might not be as needed anymore
[09:53] <trilly> hey guys, can anyone tell me if i can use pcmcia-cs with a 2.6 kernel?
[09:53] <H3g3m0n> Almost no isps are supporting it
[09:53] <kitche> H3g3m0n: it's used a lot, it's mostly used on I2 really
[09:53] <donmoog> H3g3m0n: I hear that Japan makes extensive use of IPv6
[09:54] <vnUBUNTU> LjL: its what I used and didnt have this expert mode...
[09:54] <H3g3m0n> Yeh i remember some similar ipv6 stuff about china also
[09:54] <davin> I cant seem to resize my ubuntu ext3 partition, everything is grayed out and when I try to umount it it says its busy, need help quick as I got 44 mb left in Windows
[09:54] <vnUBUNTU> maybe I had to be online?
[09:54] <kitche> vnUBUNTU: expert mode from what I have read is the oem-install
[09:54] <[A] ndy80> I've a question for Ubuntu developers: if I create a Linux application/utility and if I believe it could be usefull for other people, how can I propose to include it in the next Ubuntu release?
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> lol its what I did...I dont even find it expert :/
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> but bah, I can't complain
[09:55] <LjL> vnUBUNTU: google "expert mode site:help.ubuntu.com"
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> ubuntu is sooo lovely
[09:55] <davin> vb
[09:55] <davin> vnUBUNTU whats the problem?
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> none
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> :p
[09:55] <Jager> donmoog: commenting it out and setting it to static fixed it :)
[09:55] <vnUBUNTU> yes for workstation
[09:56] <vnUBUNTU> I prefer debian for servers
[09:56] <Spee_Der> Ok
[09:56] <JoZ^^> hi, i have an error and i cant reboot in ubuntu, how can i go to "/etc/x11/xorg.conf" from the command line ????
[09:56] <davin> vnUBUNTU: I guess ubuntu is aimed for linux newbies
[09:56] <donmoog> Jager: Great. As H3g3m0n said though, DHCP will pick up the bad DNS server when you reboot, so we need to permanently fix it.
[09:56] <davin> JoZ^^: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:56] <Firefishe> If I, in aptitude, select the Do Not Remove Packages Automatically option, that is, I disable it, is this known to cause any trouble?
[09:56] <LjL> davin: bad guess
[09:56] <donmoog> Jager: If you're happy to just go with static IP addressing, then that may be the best way forward.
[09:56] <Jager> donmoog: i already rebooted and it didnt change :)
[09:56] <JoZ^^> [davin]  y probe that and nothing
[09:56] <donmoog> Jager: Even better :-)
[09:57] <JoZ^^> i*
[09:57] <vnUBUNTU> davin, : yeah thats why I cant complain
[09:57] <Jager> (i always use static because i have ports forwarded to my machine anyways)
[09:57] <H3g3m0n> [A] ndy80: I think you have to find a MOTU and get them to put it into the universe repository
[09:57] <Firefishe> I should rephrase that last question.
[09:57] <davin> Anyway
[09:57] <vnUBUNTU> I'm customizing it to my tastes...removed the sudo thing, I know how to properly manage a system
[09:57] <aSt3raL_> how do i install a perl module
[09:57] <aSt3raL_> ?
[09:57] <davin> I cant resize my ext3 partition nor umount it, help
[09:57] <aSt3raL_> i have the .pm file
[09:57] <Clinton__> !dvd
[09:57] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[09:57] <aSt3raL_> i tried just putting it in one of the @inc directories and it doesnt see it
[09:57] <donmoog> Jager: Well, glad we got one of your problems sorted :-) I can't remember what your other problem was, did you get it fixed/
[09:58] <Lynoure> davin: are you using that partition? Then you probably want to resize it using the livecd
[09:58] <[A] ndy80> H3g3m0n: what is a MOTU?
[09:58] <H3g3m0n> [A] ndy80: Master of the universe
[09:58] <xjih78> hi
[09:58] <xjih78> need some help with a webcam
[09:58] <davin> Lynoure: I got a 200gb disk and, meh, im not even gonna explain all this, gonna try cd, thanks
[09:58] <skyfaller> uh-oh... guys, I have a serious problem
[09:58] <trilly> Can anyone tell me how to disable udev in ubuntu 6.10 edgy?? my old laptop doesnt handle it very well...
[09:58] <davin> Lynoure: yes its the partition ubuntu is on
[09:58] <Spee_Der> !ask | xjih78
[09:58] <ubotu> xjih78: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:58] <skyfaller> blanky: you still there?
[09:59] <xjih78> when i plug it how can i get it to work without rebooting?
[09:59] <blanky> skyfaller: yeah
[09:59] <xjih78> it's a USB
[09:59] <Shinoda> hey all
[09:59] <ompaul> trilly, then you have a problem, udev is how your devices are added it to your machine
[09:59] <Firefishe> If I, in aptitude, I un-X the "Remove unused packages automatically" option (Under Options-Dependency Handling), is this known to cause trouble?>
[09:59] <Lynoure> davin: then, really, you need to do it from livecd or similar, you cannot resize what you need to be using
[09:59] <skyfaller> blanky: there's something wrong with GRUB or whatever, I can't select the options besides the default... the up and down arrows aren't working
[09:59] <ompaul> trilly,  http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html
[10:00] <trilly> ompaul: but i can use devfs instead
[10:00] <donmoog> Clinton__: Is !dvd wrong? libdvdcss2 is in multiverse/universe
[10:00] <ompaul> trilly, not in a 2.6 kernel that I am aware of
[10:00] <Clinton__> donmoog: I'm having problems playing an encrypted dvd...
[10:00] <Rprp> How can i check the TimEZone in debian on a server?
[10:00] <tengil> hey im trying to get tv out to work with my nvidia card. i got it to display on two different monitors but i still got no picture on the tv. anyone got any pointers?
[10:00] <donmoog> Clinton__: Did you run the dvdcss.sh script?
[10:00] <Shinoda> is there a way to manually associate a file name extension to a command?
[10:00] <Clinton__> donmoog: nope - didn't know I needed to till just a couple seconds ago
[10:01] <bimberi> Rprp: tzconfig (as superuser)
[10:01] <trilly> ompaul: ah crap, you are right.. but i dont want to use a 2.4 kernel.. meeh! everything works great, except for pcmcia.. WHY cant i use pcmcia with 2.6!!
[10:01] <blanky> hold up skyfaller
[10:01] <Rprp> Ty
[10:01] <trilly> ompaul: can you tell me how to switch to 2.4? i can try at least..

[10:02] <vnUBUNTU> how would you rename all .JPG files to .jpg files...with their same actual filename
[10:02] <Clinton__> donmoog: I'm actually a kubuntu user.  I did tempararily install Totem to try it out, but that didn't work either.

[10:03] <trilly> ompaul: i tried plugging it in to everything (seriously, even usb ports ;) (if i only had any..) )
[10:03] <skyfaller> blanky: OK, nevermind, a reboot mysteriously fixed it
[10:03] <trilly> ompaul: worst part is, when i remove the card the whole system freezes
[10:03] <ompaul> trilly, what is the cards job?

[10:05] <blanky> skyfaller: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst BE CAREFUL, don't worry it's not scarey, just don't do anything dumb
[10:05] <v4m21> and also totem-gstreamer isn't properly handling dvd menus, anyfix for this ?
[10:05] <trilly> ompaul: its a powerbook g3 and an old netgear ma401 wlan card.. i would just give up, but i got it to work once, i just dont know how... it was right after install i (stupidly) installed "pcmcia*" and the old (!) cardctl from pcmcia recognized the card and i could use it.. but after a restart
[10:05] <trilly> ompaul: it was gone
[10:05] <flugh> well , that would lowercase the whole filename though
[10:05] <blanky> skyfaller: if you want, paste it at http://paste.jorgepena.be and I'll set it up for you

[10:06] <Fall2Hell> ive installed ubuntu but i can acsess the internet
[10:07] <trilly> ompaul: cant, formatted the harddrive since then (actually swapped it..) perhaps if i blacklist the pcmcia_core package and try to just use cardctl?

[10:12] <vnUBUNTU> flugh, ehe ok
[10:12] <zcat[1] > Vixus: don't even bother with the live cd.. at the grub prompt type 'e', then go down to the second line and type 'e' again, remove where it says "quiet splash" and replace it with "init=/bin/bash" then press enter, then 'b' to boot...
[10:13] <vnUBUNTU> I know of a php function to do it... guess rename has this option too

[10:40] <Lynoure> timo90: you have no iptables rules set, so those are not keeping you from "accessing the internet"
[10:40] <frontpage> for what?
[10:40] <charlotte> did you follow this guide:
[10:40] <peertje> How can I change the link /cdrom
[10:40] <neophile> If backports is enabled, do I get the updates for there automatically or have to explicitly install them? Please someone help..
[10:40] <tommyw> is the boot splash screen (between the GRUB menu and the login screen) part of the kernel or is there a conf file somewhere that I can update to specify a new image?
[10:40] <charlotte> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[10:41] <frontpage> oops
[10:41] <frontpage> nope
[10:41] <frontpage> dammit

[10:41] <frontpage> another cd-r trownen away
[10:41] <timo90> Lynoure:You know in windows you just run a wizard, i thou in linux its all about it tables
[10:41] <frontpage> so i need to do the hash thing?
[10:41] <Phuzion> Where does Wine save all its crap to?
[10:41] <Lynoure> timo90: setting any rules will not help you access it, either, the problem is elsewhere.
[10:41] <charlotte> this is the error I got: Kernel panic - not syncing: fatal exception in interrupt
[10:41] <donmoog> Phuzion: ~/.wine/
[10:41] <peertje> default is linking to /media/cdrom0 but since my DVD burner doesn't read CD's anymore, I am forced to use my CDRom player, but Synaptic is using /cdrom as repository
[10:42] <Phuzion> thanks
[10:42] <donmoog> Phuzion: That is, <homedir>/.wine/
[10:42] <charlotte> frontpage, no, there are other ways, but following the guide makes sure the CD is ok
[10:42] <timo90> Lynoure:what do i do to set up my network
[10:42] <Lynoure> timo90: iptables is a firewall, you know that, right?
[10:42] <Phuzion> donmoog, yeah, I got that, thanks
[10:42] <Allz|> i torn on my computer and then i go to ubuntu not windows and then ubuntu loades up and when it is finshed loading up her plugins and stuff this comes up -> "NO ipv6 present" and it doesnt show up ubuntu just this :(
[10:42] <neophile> How do I upgrade using backports? please please help me..
[10:42] <timo90> Lynoure:i do now
[10:42] <charlotte> if we're sure the CD is ok we can exclude that from possible problems
[10:42] <anton_> charlotte: that sounds bad. as if the kernel isn't finding something important
=== skeetbadger_ is now known as skeetbadger
[10:43] <charlotte> anton_, I know. It's a total hang. Only physical power off fixes it
[10:43] <peertje> how can I change /root/cdrom ???
[10:43] <charlotte> it happens about 1 out of 5 boots
[10:43] <timo90> lynoure: i have tryed putting ip address like 192.168.0.2
[10:43] <peertje> it needs to link to cdrom1 instead of cdrom 0
[10:43] <anton_> charlotte: have you tried compiling the kernel differently?
[10:43] <charlotte> peertje, what would you like to do exactly?
[10:43] <timo90> or 1
[10:43] <Lynoure> timo90: I'm too sleepy to help with that wide a problem, but I'm sure someone will help you. They'll prolly ask you to pastebin   ifconfig  and possibly   route   or some  ping  commands
[10:43] <frontpage> to wich hash must it match?
[10:44] <peertje> charlotte, the /root/cdrom link is linking to /media/cdrom0 default right?
[10:44] <timo90> Lynoure:that it route i have to rouet my ipadreses
[10:44] <peertje> now I need it to bed /media/cdrom1 how do I change that?
[10:44] <charlotte> anton_ not yet. I was hoping it was some sort of known issue. Ill see what respones ill get from the forums
[10:44] <timo90> Lynoure:tell me how to edit route ,that will do for now
[10:45] <frontpage> hey
[10:45] <frontpage> i just saw
[10:45] <frontpage> that i do not have the newest version
[10:45] <frontpage> ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386
[10:45] <Jager> Anyone know how to get FF to pop up when I click a new link? it just pops up in the background. my friend told me this is a gnome problem?
[10:45] <frontpage> my hash correponds btw
[10:45] <bruenig> peertje, do file /root/cdrom to see what it is actually, if it is a symlink, what it is linking to
[10:45] <frontpage> ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386 is an older version right?
[10:45] <Lynoure> timo90: do  man route  to find that out
[10:46] <charlotte> peertje a /root/cdrom is not standard..
[10:46] <frontpage> charlotte ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386 is an older version right?
[10:46] <donmoog> frontpage: Yes, that's 6.06 - Released June 2006, it's one release older than current.
[10:46] <burner> frontpage: 6.06.1 is the long term support one, but yes, 6.10 exists
[10:46] <anton_> someone with a routing problem?
[10:46] <frontpage> dammit
[10:46] <burner> lol
[10:46] <frontpage> oh well im ganno try somem ore stuff
[10:46] <charlotte> personaly i advice to go with 6.06
[10:46] <Allz|> i torn on my computer and then i go to ubuntu not windows and then ubuntu loades up and when it is finshed loading up her plugins and stuff this comes up -> "NO ipv6 present" and it doesnt show up ubuntu just this :(
[10:46] <frontpage> the one i got now?
[10:46] <frontpage> ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386?
[10:46] <charlotte> yeah
[10:47] <frontpage> k
[10:47] <Lynoure> anton_: I think just with general "cannot connect to net" problem
[10:47] <peertje> Charlotte, I removed it
[10:47] <anton_> Lynoure: oh, okay.
[10:47] <Lynoure> anton_: and I'm too sleepy to help with a wide problem like that
[10:47] <peertje> in xterm it was lightblue instead of blue
[10:47] <Jager> Why does the volume icon in my panel show mute when I can hear stuff? O_o
[10:47] <anton_> Lynoure: well, i'll give it a go then :)
[10:47] <Lynoure> anton_: :)
[10:47] <peertje> so
[10:47] <charlotte> you sure your processor is a i386?
[10:47] <charlotte> it probably is
[10:47] <charlotte> but just asking
[10:48] <peertje> it it's a symlink
[10:48] <peertje> I'm x64 (A)
[10:48] <anton_> peertje: whereto?
[10:48] <opossumjack> I've installed Ubuntu 6.10 on a IBM thinkpad T22. After a while it runs, it freezes down and I can't wake it up,,,, CAN ANYONE HeLP ME?
[10:48] <timo90> OMG such a huge list
[10:48] <peertje> to /media/cdrom probably, which is a symlink to /media/cdrom0
[10:48] <charlotte> peertje, the processor was meant for someone else ;) but thanks for the info
[10:48] <peertje> how do I make / edit a symlink?
[10:48] <Firefishe> opossumjack:  easy on the caps, man, my eyes just got boxed ;) hee
[10:49] <peertje> I allready tought so :P
[10:49] <anton_> opossumjack: thinkpads usually play nice with linux. can you give us some more information? (dmesg, /var/log/mesages etc)
[10:49] <TokenBad> how come when run command make...it says command not found?
[10:49] <pianoboy3333> TokenBad: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[10:49] <Firefishe> anton_:  so nice of IBM to make that happen :)
[10:49] <anton_> TokenBad: i think make is part of gnuutils
[10:50] <TokenBad> thanks to both
[10:50] <anton_> TokenBad: or maybe build-essential :)
[10:50] <bruenig> or just sudo apt-get install make
[10:50] <donmoog> anton_, TokenBad: make is part of the package called make :-_
[10:50] <TokenBad> did you guys read that info on net about data being saved to normal paper?
[10:50] <donmoog> *:-)
[10:50] <anton_> donmoog: does sort of make sense when you think about it :)
[10:51] <donmoog> If you need make, you'll probably need other stuff so better off sudo apt-get install build-essential
[10:51] <Jager> who uses wine?
[10:51] <charlotte> why make is not in the standard ubuntu package is a mystery to me
[10:51] <TokenBad> yeah got that.....but seems I either messed something up or don't understand what I am trying to install
[10:51] <charlotte> Jager, I do, but rarely get it to work properly
[10:51] <opossumjack> anton_: I have no message... It just stand by and I have to push the power button and then power on.... I thought was a power management problem...It can this be true?
[10:52] <peertje> charlotte, how do I make a symlink?
[10:52] <Jager> charlotte, have you ever managed to install ventrilo with it?
[10:52] <skeetbadger> is there a specific 64 bit channel somewhere ?
[10:52] <anton_> opossumjack: it can be a power management problem. i think you can boot the kernel with -noacpi and chek it
[10:52] <donmoog> charlotte: Well, make is kindof useless without gcc, some -dev packages etc. etc., so I guess it's due to lack of space on the CD
[10:53] <charlotte> peertje, I don't know, im trying to google it for you, or you can do that yourself
[10:53] <charlotte> Jager, No, but then again I never tried
[10:53] <charlotte> jager, isn't there just a ventrillo for Linux?
[10:53] <anton_> !64bit
[10:53] <ubotu> AMD64 and EMT64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See http://tinyurl.com/jv6tc for more information.
[10:53] <opossumjack> anton_ I've already tryed to unactivate acpi on the kernel boot... same thing.....
[10:53] <Jager> charlotte, its been under development for years :(
[10:53] <TurtleBoots> guys
[10:53] <odla> peertje: to make a symlink it's ln -s
[10:53] <peertje> charlotte tnx, I have some ideas now to
[10:53] <peertje> greetz
[10:53] <TurtleBoots> can anyone advise on how to set up a new interface for wireless????
[10:53] <TurtleBoots> i.e. eth3
[10:53] <TurtleBoots> or whatever ;-)
[10:54] <anton_> opossumjack: then i imagine it isn't a power problem :) how far does it get booting?
[10:54] <kmull> i am having issues with firefox and multiple tabs and ffox getting 'stuck' unable to switch tabs
[10:54] <charlotte> Jager, maybe there is anohter client that supports the ventrillo protocol? have you checked the repos for ventrillo?
[10:54] <Jager> charlotte, I'm looking
[10:54] <anton_> TurtleBoots: does eth3 already exist?
[10:54] <opossumjack> anton_: it happens only if I leave the computer inactive, not when I'm working (for example using internet, writing a document......)
[10:55] <TurtleBoots> anton_ no but I want to create a new interface. eth3 was just an example
[10:55] <TurtleBoots> anton_ can you advise PLEASE?
[10:55] <Zylogue> I am looking for details on what services are 'provided' with an install of Ubuntu Server.  can anyone point e to the correct answer sheet, please?
[10:55] <anton_> TurtleBoots: why do you need a new network node?
[10:55] <Jager> I found some ventrilo script for linux....
[10:56] <kmull> I am having issues with firefox and multiple tabs and ffox getting stuck, unable to switch between tabs until i close the one i am on
[10:56] <anton_> opossumjack: what happens if you switch off the power management stuff in gnome?
[10:56] <TurtleBoots> anton_ becuase I can't get eth1 to work wirelessly so I was gonna try configuring a new one
[10:56] <hajiki> hey guys how do i fix this??
[10:56] <hajiki> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
[10:56] <muge2510> hi all
[10:56] <charlotte> Jager, i stumbled onto it too. I dunno how it works or confs tho
[10:56] <TurtleBoots> anton_ what do you think I should try?
[10:56] <kmull> anyone?
[10:56] <anton_> TurtleBoots: what does iwconfig tell you?
[10:57] <opossumjack> anton_: I' haven't tryed it.....I try right now
[10:57] <Zylogue> I am looking for details on what services are 'provided' with an install of Ubuntu Server.  can anyone point me to the correct answer sheet, please?
[10:57] <frontpage> still nothing
[10:57] <frontpage> ..
[10:57] <anton_> TurtleBoots: in general, eth0, 1, whatever are just nodes. changing the name doesn'T change anything internally
[10:57] <Jager> If only I could boot back onto windows...
[10:57] <TurtleBoots> anton_ it says eth1 not ready!
[10:57] <frontpage> im ganno try using another disc
[10:57] <crispo> hello all
[10:57] <frontpage> another cd/r trow away
[10:57] <peertje> charlotte symbolic links can be made with the command ln with the option -s
[10:58] <tania> had to move my swap partion .. how do I reconfigure edgy to locate new swap?
[10:58] <crispo> could someone plz tell me what port samba uses ?
[10:58] <anton_> TurtleBoots: can you paste the entire output of iwconfig?
[10:58] <TokenBad> has anyone got xsys to show xmms stuff like it says it can?
[10:58] <kmull> I am having issues with firefox and multiple tabs and ffox getting stuck, unable to switch between tabs until i close the one i am on. can anyone help?
[10:58] <charlotte> cheers peertje
[10:58] <TurtleBoots> anton_ yes I can, but can you start a private chat? rather than put it all in here???
[10:58] <anton_> tania: /etc/fstab
[10:58] <hajiki> hey guys how do i fix: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b???
[10:58] <anton_> !paste
[10:58] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:58] <peertje> :D and it WORX!!!
[10:59] <anton_> tania: but try it out with swapon first
[10:59] <n30n> I have a tgz file containing a wireless card driver, how do i install it
[10:59] <Jager> :O!!!!
[10:59] <anton_> TurtleBoots: on second thoughts, i've gotta be running to catch a train. sorry :(
[10:59] <Jager> charlotte, I got ventrilo installed with wine
[11:00] <TurtleBoots> anton_ you away?
[11:00] <d03boy> does ventrilo run worht a fcrap on wine?
[11:00] <Jowi> hajiki, probably a driver issue. try with another driver if possible (i get a similar error for my graphics card driver intel 945GM)
[11:00] <kmull> I am having issues with firefox and multiple tabs and ffox getting stuck, unable to switch between tabs until i close the one i am on
[11:00] <Jager> Im installing, about to find out
[11:00] <TurtleBoots> can anyone else please help with wireless config
=== magnet__ is now known as magnet
[11:01] <Firefishe> kmull..that's a strange problem
[11:01] <Jager> lol i installed.. I have no idea how to run it now
[11:01] <hajiki> i have  intel 945GM too
[11:01] <Zylogue> kmull, Have you added any extensions, addon, etc for FFox?
[11:01] <vintendo> kmull: maybe u dont have enough ram?
[11:01] <Jowi> hajiki, intel mac mini?
[11:01] <hajiki> nope
[11:01] <kmull> Only add on is Foxmarks, I have disabled it
[11:01] <kmull> and i have 1 gig of ram
[11:01] <vintendo> hmm
[11:01] <Jowi> hajiki, do you get the resolution you need at all?
[11:01] <kmull> although in about:config i did limit the useage from 50000 to 15000 per lifehacker instructions
[11:01] <mike1o> did anybody manage to install a usb 2.0 PCI adapter?
[11:02] <hajiki> yeah
[11:02] <Zylogue> kmull, don't disable it, remove it...and restart FFox.  See if that helps any
[11:03] <n30n> I have the ipw2200 tgz file for the wireless driver, where do i unpack it?
[11:03] <Jowi> hajiki, I would think that this error will be cleared up in the near future. remember that this hardware and driver are pretty new.
[11:03] <kmull> let me try thar
[11:03] <kmull> t
[11:03] <forngren> I tried to setup ntfs-3g on my system, but it doesn't work, I don't see the mounts and when I tries to acces them from /media/sdaX they are just blank, my it have something todo with my fstab? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33985/
[11:04] <Jowi> hajiki, guess you use 915resolution and the i810 driver
[11:04] <kmull> zylogue: still happening
[11:04] <kmull> should i increase how much memory it can use?
[11:04] <hajiki> oh ok
[11:04] <vintendo> kmull make sure in system monitor that FFox is ended. sometimes it plays a fast one and stays open and u dont know
[11:04] <we2by> I have this smb mount issue
[11:04] <maxxism> forngren yes it could.
[11:04] <hajiki> yes
[11:04] <we2by> it works fine the first time mounting a smb
[11:04] <Zylogue> kmull, remove FFox and re-install it.  maybe try a different version number?
[11:04] <Jowi> we're in the same boat hajiki
[11:04] <we2by> but if I leave my pc on for a few hours and come back, it can't connect any more
[11:04] <hajiki> >.>
[11:04] <we2by> or I have to restart nautilus
[11:04] <dm> Is there anyway to change the text on the main panel of gnome to whitE????
[11:05] <hajiki> well thanks for the help
[11:05] <Jowi> np
[11:05] <maxxism> we2by are the smb mounts on a windows system?
[11:05] <we2by> maxkelley, nope. Ubuntu
[11:05] <tania> anton_: did that ... edited fstab is there but 'mount' doesnt give expected data
[11:05] <tania> anton_ , but did not do this swapon thing. what exactly should I do to swapon
[11:05] <Cosmonaut3030> Can someone help me set up the Ipw on my thinkpad?
[11:05] <we2by> it is samba
[11:06] <maxxism> we2by use NFS then.  much better
[11:06] <we2by> both systems are running Ubuntu
[11:06] <kmull> zylogue: removal or complete removal
[11:06] <tania> anyone ... howto reconfigure swap device in edgy?
[11:06] <dm> Is there anyway to change the text on the main panel of gnome to whitE????
[11:06] <we2by> maxxism, ?? what is nfs? how do I set it up?
[11:06] <Zylogue> complete removal of FFox and any extras you got for it.
[11:06] <kmull> k
[11:06] <kmull> let me go try that, thanks
[11:06] <Jowi> tania, is the swap partition created already and you just need to tell the system to use it?
[11:06] <Cosmonaut3030> Can someone help me set up the Ipw on my thinkpad?
[11:06] <maxxism> NFS is the unix varitant of SMB.  but waaaaay better
[11:06] <we2by> !nfs
[11:06] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[11:07] <we2by> maxxism, but sometimes I have to use windows xp.
[11:07] <tengil> can i setup so i have 3 different screens. two monitors and one tv. the only way i got tv to work now it starting a new x session for that display but then both my monitors go black
[11:07] <Slart> I'm trying to install Enemy territory on Ubuntu 6.10 64 bit and it keeps dying with the error "The setup program seems to have failed on x86/glibc-2.0" . Anyone know what to do about it?
[11:07] <jeff2> I have a Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop (keyboard/mouse combo), but only the mouse works in Linux. The keyboard signal is being received by the wireless receiver, because the LEDs toggle, but Linux fails to recognize the keyboard. Plugging in just the keyboard does not work, either. dmesg says "device not accepting address" and I tried every port, a powered USB hub, rmmod ohci_hcd, new batteries, and verified /proc/interru
[11:07] <jeff2> pts was incrementing. What now? Does Linux just not support MS Wireless Optical Keyboards?
[11:07] <maxxism> we2by.  ok then.
[11:07] <maxxism> so nautilus crashes with your smb mounts?
[11:08] <we2by> yea
[11:08] <Cosmonaut3030> Can someone help me set up the Ipw on my thinkpad?
[11:08] <frontpage> charlotte pleas join ubuntu-nl i need help in dutch
[11:08] <dm> jeff2 Microsoft keyboards always have trouble in linux, i think thats mostly because the people who use linux dont use microsuck products
[11:08] <we2by> maxkelley, can I run samba and NFS on the same machine?
[11:08] <icepack12> jeff2: it supports it, i have m$ wireless optical keyboard/mouse too
[11:08] <maxxism> we2by can you read your logs on the problem?
[11:08] <maxxism> we2by yes I run both on mine.
[11:08] <dm> jeff2 the people who program linux*
[11:08] <we2by> ok, gonna do it then
[11:08] <frontpage> i really need help, ubuntu doesnt loads after windows restart
[11:08] <we2by> maxkelley, nah, it works fine if I relaunch nautilus
[11:08] <Cosmonaut3030> Can someone help me set up the Ipw on my thinkpad?
[11:09] <skyfaller> hey folks, I'm coming from Mac OS X... is there an equivalent to MenuMeters for Ubuntu?  http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/
[11:09] <jeff2> icepack12, hmm...so it works for someone. what version of ubuntu are you on? what kernel?
[11:09] <we2by> skyfaller, explain a bit about that menumeter
[11:09] <Cosmonaut3030> Can someone help me set up the Ipw on my thinkpad?
[11:09] <maxxism> skyfaller never checked it out.  but there is normal menulets that do similar.
[11:10] <icepack12> 6.06, 2.6.15-27-686
[11:10] <jeff2> icepack12, have you connected the keyboard to your computer via USB through the supplied PS/2-to-USB converter, or directly through PS/2?
[11:10] <frontpage> nonone can help me?
[11:10] <icepack12> skyfaller: lmsensors and gkrellm
[11:10] <skyfaller> kind of like GKrellM, I guess, except easier to read and it fits in your menu bar
[11:10] <sizzam> skyfaller: right-click on your Gnome-Panel and choose 'Add to Panel', then pick 'System Monitor'
[11:10] <we2by> !chm
[11:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about chm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:10] <masterninja> if i installed a xgl package will it work once i rebooted it?
[11:10] <sizzam> skyfaller: then, when that applet appears, rightclick on it for more preferences
[11:10] <masterninja> if i did it with synaptic?
[11:10] <maxxism> skyfaller there is a basic set that comes with gnome
[11:10] <skyfaller> sizzam: hm, that sounds easy, I'll try that, thank you :)
[11:10] <icepack12> jeff2: keybaord goes to ps/2, mouse to usb
[11:11] <sizzam> skyfaller: it does processor, memory, network, swap space, load, and harddisk
[11:11] <dm> jeff2 the people who program linux*
[11:11] <dm> Is there anyway to change the text on the main panel of gnome to whitE????
[11:11] <dm> jeff2 woops
[11:11] <kmull> still happening
[11:12] <maxxism> dm download a theme......
[11:12] <jeff2> icepack12, you're lucky you have a ps/2 port all I have is usb :( if you're not busy would you be able to try connecting the keyboard through usb as well?
[11:12] <dm> maxxism well theres no way to change it as an option ?
[11:12] <lufis> Anyone know how to crop an image in Inkscape?
[11:12] <maxxism> dm if you learn to make your own themes yes.  hehe
[11:12] <dm> mexxism lol thanks..
[11:13] <kmarius> what script in /etc needs to be removed (or what process do i have to nuke) to STOP ubuntu from switching my turned-off laptop monitor back on?
[11:13] <dm> maxxism lol thanks
[11:13] <Phuzion> how do I check and see what kind of video card I have in this machine?
[11:13] <sladen> dm: MS' keyboards should work fine and out-of-the-box under Linux---if they don't, that's a bug which you should file
[11:13] <dm> maxxism Metacity theme right? or grk
[11:13] <lufis> Phuzion: go to "Device manager" and see if that helps
[11:13] <dm> maxxism tk *
[11:13] <DarkY> people
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[11:13] <daugustine> hey room
[11:13] <DarkY> whats the best wlan config tool?
[11:14] <maxxism> dm cant remember check out art.gnome.org
[11:14] <DarkY> =P
[11:14] <dm> sladen i dont own microsoft products.
[11:14] <Phuzion> lufis, thanks
[11:14] <DarkY> ive got the intel centrino wlan card
[11:14] <DevC> what is the release number for Ubuntu now?
[11:14] <DarkY> whats the best wlan config tool at all? :/
[11:14] <lufis> Phuzion: no prob
[11:14] <icepack12> DevC: 6.10
[11:14] <DarkY> DevC: 6.10
[11:14] <mike1o> did anybody manage to install a usb 2.0 PCI adapter?
[11:14] <skyfaller> sizzam: hm, that Gnome-panel thing is pretty good, except it doesn't show actual numbers
[11:14] <daugustine> anybody know why it takes forever to suspend in edgy on my ibook g3
[11:15] <maxxism> mikelo it should be autodetected.  unless an odd chipset.
[11:15] <sladen> jeff2: 'ohci' is for the Firewire controller, (uhci and ehci are USB)
[11:15] <Jowi> nano is acting up on me. each time nano is launched by sudo .nano_history chmods to -rw------- so the user can not access it after sudo has used nano. can anyone confirm if this is a bug in dapper (fully updated)
[11:15] <DevC> darn I'm back on 5.04 :o
[11:15] <skyfaller> sizzam: like, MenuMeters shows you both a graph of your network usage and how many kb/s you're sending up and pulling down at any time
[11:15] <lufis> The page in Inkscape I'm working on is too big. I just want a detail from it to be exported as SVG/PNG, but I'm new to it and can't seem to find a "Crop" or "Canvas size" tool
[11:15] <sladen> jeff2: have you googled for "device not accepting address" ?
[11:15] <DevC> there is no way to upgrade to 6.10 without having to get the disc and installing over 5.04 is there?
[11:16] <mirak> hi
[11:16] <sladen> lufis: select the item/group and use 'Export'
[11:16] <lufis> sladen: Hmm. I'll try that, thanks
[11:16] <LjL> DevC: you don't have to get the disc. but you must upgrade incrementally, i.e. from 5.04 to 5.10, then to 6.06, etc
[11:16] <Jowi> lufis, file -> export bitmap and click on Selection or Custom
[11:16] <LjL> Ubotu, tell DevC about upgrade | DevC, see the private message from Ubotu
[11:16] <maxxism> DevC you could change your repos and do a upgrade with apt-get
[11:17] <mirak> when I try to load lirc_serial module, kernel says it's busy. I then need to do  setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart none  then after that I can insmod. why do I need to do that ? I didn't needed it before
[11:17] <sladen> lufis: sorry, that appears to only for bitmap/etc.  Select the items you want, copy and paste into a new document, save that
[11:17] <DevC> ok thanks...one other question....about networking, I have a few PCs in network and I was wondering what the command was for sending messages to that computer was cause I can't remember right off
[11:17] <sladen> lufis: the page size alterable in File->Document Properties
[11:18] <lufis> sladen: Thank you so much :)
[11:18] <sladen> DevC: what type of "messages" ?
[11:18] <skyfaller> is anyone here using gDesklets?
[11:18] <skyfaller> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDesklets
[11:18] <maxxism> skyfaller I did.  i didnt like it.
[11:18] <nolimitsoya> could someone please point me in the direction of a good ogg media metadata tagger? easytag seems prone to messing things up...
[11:18] <DevC> ie I'm DellUser on the network and I want to send messages to ToshibaUser but can't recall the command to type into the command prompt to send stuff like "hi" or "surprise"
[11:18] <alecjw> how can i play a flash in epiphany?
[11:18] <maxxism> skyfaller  some of the desklets were crap
[11:18] <skyfaller> maxxism: ah, that is too bad, it looks like it might have potential... what was wrong with it?
[11:18] <sladen> DevC: if they are MS Windows machines, they you can send pop-up messages using  smbclient
[11:18] <lufis> nolimitsoya: What about Amarok? Depends on what you want to do, though...
[11:19] <tonyyarusso> I'm wondering about hardware compatibility for a digital voice recorder.  (Checking the wiki - but give me a ping if you know anything)
[11:19] <sladen> DevC: if it's a Unix machine, they use  'talk'  or similar
[11:19] <sladen> DevC: or ideally IRC/Instant Messaging
[11:19] <DevC> yeah ToshibaUser is WinXP Sp2 pc
[11:19] <maxxism> skyfaller I am a minimalist.  it was too whizbang for my liking.
[11:19] <jeff2> sladen, yes, I've tried the suggestions at linux-usb.org to no avail
[11:20] <Doow> russian-dude: did you install build-essential ?
[11:20] <sladen> DevC: 'smbclient' is part of 'Samba' and are the tools for talking SMB (the MS file-sharing protocol) to MS Windows machines
[11:20] <Milos_SD> why when I install VmWare Server, and I want to run it, my PC stop responding. But if I restart PC, I can use VmWare?
[11:20] <sladen> alecjw: install 'flashplugin-nonfree'
[11:21] <DevC> ok....was samba part of Ubuntu or an installation option?
[11:21] <mirak> lsmod | grep lirc
[11:21] <gorgonzola> ubuntu sucks!!!
[11:21] <sladen> Milos_SD: can you rephrase the question/ask it in a different way.  It is hard to follow your issue
[11:21] <gorgonzola> sorry had to get that off my chest
[11:21] <maxxism> gorgonzola so go somewhere else then.
[11:21] <sladen> gorgonzola: indeed it does, now move along please
[11:21] <nolimitsoya> lufis, id rather not mess upmy amarok database. :) im merging several archiver, with different tagging routines...
[11:22] <Milos_SD> Today I instaled VmWare Server
[11:22] <sladen> Milos_SD: yup
[11:22] <Milos_SD> and configured it ok
[11:22] <dm> Does anyone know how i cant change the text on my panels to white, without using a theme ?? ??
[11:22] <Milos_SD> but, when I tryed to start it, my PC stoped responding
[11:22] <alecjw> sladen: thanks!
[11:22] <gorgonzola> the only reason i'm saying this is because i am sick of guys simply advising me to install ubuntu when i have a problem with my system, OPEN SOURCE IS ABOUT FREEDOM!!
[11:22] <bruenig> !caps
[11:22] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[11:22] <Milos_SD> and I had to restart it with restart button
[11:23] <DarkY> @all: whats the best wlan config tool at all? :/
[11:23] <Milos_SD> It was the same with vmware player ...
[11:23] <lufis> nolimitsoya: Ahh, ok
[11:23] <wildchild> I am looking for apache.conf
[11:23] <thirstyferret> DarkY: I found NetworkManager to be the best...
[11:23] <wildchild> how can I find apache.conf on the server?
[11:23] <wildchild> please help
[11:23] <LjL> !offtopic | gorgonzola
[11:23] <ubotu> gorgonzola: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[11:23] <DarkY> thirstyferret: it dont works with my centrino network card :x
[11:23] <gorgonzola> thank you
[11:24] <LjL> gorgonzola: this is the Ubuntu support channel. do you have a support question, or are you willing to answer support questions? if not, you probably don't want to be here
[11:24] <lufis> sladen: Thanks again for the Inkscape help. Worked perfectly
[11:24] <bruenig> !thanks | gorgonzola
[11:24] <ubotu> gorgonzola: You're Welcome!
[11:24] <thirstyferret> DarkY: have you tried WifiRadar? I didn't get on too well with it on my Broadcom 4318 (but that's a bit of a devil anyway)
[11:24] <DarkY> thirstyferret: no i will try k? =D
[11:25] <sladen> Milos_SD: VMware require various kernel modules loading, which come from VMware.  The best thing would be to file a bug report as (a) VMware is external/binary software  (b) the kernel shouldn't actually ever crash
[11:26] <sladen> wildchild: /etc/apache/httpd.conf
=== lukas_ is now known as Sky123
=== Ingar_ is now known as ingar
[11:27] <wildchild> sladen: in etc isn't apache :S
[11:27] <DarkY> thirstyferret: where can i get wifi radar? oo
[11:27] <wildchild> sladen: but is httpd
[11:27] <sladen> wildchild: could you explain your question again, I'm having some difficulty understanding
[11:27] <DarkY> k found it ^^
[11:27] <thirstyferret> DarkY: just a tick
[11:28] <public> hello
[11:28] <thirstyferret> DarkY: good :P
[11:28] <wildchild> sladen: I was looking for "apache.conf"
[11:28] <DarkY> thirstyferret: what name is 6.10 :x
[11:28] <DarkY> thirstyferret: brezzy? dapper? edgy? feisty? :x
[11:28] <thirstyferret> DarkY: Edgy Eft
[11:28] <sladen> wildchild: 'Apache' does not use '/etc/httpd' as there are many HTTP daemons (servers) available, and if all those HTTP servers tried to use that directory for their configuration you'd have a bit of a problem
[11:28] <thirstyferret> DarkY: ;)
[11:28] <DevC> ok is SAMBA part of Ubuntu or do I have to do apt-get in order to use smbclient? been so long since I have used Ubuntu (obviously)
[11:28] <DarkY> thirstyferret: thx =D
[11:28] <kitche> DarkY: edgy feisty is the new version of ubuntu being developed
[11:29] <lakin> how do you change the password for your gnome keyring?
[11:29] <Doow> DevC: try it =)
[11:29] <public> can anyone help me with some advice on how to get an ISA soundcard working under ubuntu? I cant seem to find the right modules..any help?

[11:30] <nolimitsoya> *-t
[11:30] <kmarius> timo90, type ifconfig
[11:30] <sladen> DevC: install the package 'smbclient', and if you want to recieve messages, isntall 'linpopup'
[11:30] <timo90> thank you kmarius:
[11:30] <timo90> exactly what im looking for
[11:30] <sladen> DevC: there isn't space on the CD to install everything available in Ubuntu!
[11:31] <public> alsaconf used to be a handy program
[11:31] <thirstyferret> kmarius: never knew that :)
[11:31] <sladen> timo90: /sbin/ifconfig

[11:33] <masterninja> worked before
[11:33] <Fallen^Angel> "not replacing existing default route through ppp0" - is this liveCD issue?
[11:33] <sladen> public: ISA and PCI are two different bus types.  It's not possible to have a card that is both.  Which do you have?
[11:33] <sladen> masterninja: do you get an error message when this happens?
[11:33] <sladen> masterninja: have you tried closing gaim and restarting?
[11:34] <masterninja> just says faild to connect
[11:34] <public> sorry its ISA
[11:34] <masterninja> turning gaim on and off does nothing
[11:34] <thirstyferret> masterninja: silly question... have you checked settings? connection properties?
[11:34] <masterninja> yeah yeah i dont all that

[11:35] <sladen> masterninja: MSN does have server issues from time to time.  Have you tried checking your details using an online web-based MSN client?
[11:35] <kmarius> so you've reinstalled ubuntu on the same box, public ?
[11:35] <masterninja> nope ill try it
[11:36] <sladen> Fallen^Angel: you already have a connection setup;  are you trying to bring up two connections to the internet?
[11:36] <sladen> Fallen^Angel: eg. via a Network Card and via an ADSL modem?
[11:36] <public> yes and I had forgotten about the sound issue on reinstall
[11:36] <kmarius> public, if it's the same installation you might be able to dig something from your history file
[11:36] <spunk_> My wifi card is up'n'running all fine, but I want to know which driver is used for it. How can I get that info?
[11:37] <sladen> public: ISA PnP cards should work out of the box on Ubuntu, if it's not you may need to load a module manually and we'd like you to file a bug report
[11:37] <public> I just found another soundcar in a drawer
[11:37] <public> brb  thx
[11:37] <masterninja> are you ment to put your whole email in the screen name field?
[11:37] <devilsadvocate> masterninja, yes
[11:38] <sladen> public: you can find the low-level PnP information in  /sys/bus/pnp/  using the 'ls' and 'cat' commands to explore

[11:43] <masterninja> satan*
[11:43] <chaosmeika> hey there
[11:43] <jerp> angel*
[11:43] <narrchy> Well I burnt the cd and it has the .iso on it but I cannot boot it from the cd at all
[11:43] <narrchy> I used isorecorder to do it
[11:43] <chaosmeika> I was wondering if there was anyone who had experience with installing ubuntu 6 on a laptop
[11:43] <masterninja> :P
[11:43] <narrchy> onto a CD-RW
[11:43] <masterninja> i have
[11:43] <chaosmeika> laptop in question is an old compaq presario 1200
[11:43] <masterninja> im on a ubuntu laptop
[11:43] <masterninja> yea?
[11:43] <maxxism> narrchy when you view the disk does it have a file  called blah.iso
[11:44] <chaosmeika> ah cool
[11:44] <narrchy> no
[11:44] <chaosmeika> well for some odd reason
[11:44] <chaosmeika> its not really installing for me
[11:44] <Jager> how do i install .deb files from terminal again?
[11:44] <maxxism> narrchy ok.  so check your bios and make sure your system is set to boot from cd.
[11:44] <masterninja> yeah happend on my dads laptop
[11:44] <sladen> chaosmeika: there's no such thing as 'Ubuntu 6', the version number is the  year and month of release (eg. 6.10 was released in 2006/October)
[11:44] <masterninja> is it to slow or something?
[11:44] <narrchy> it is
[11:45] <chaosmeika> oh...
[11:45] <sladen> chaosmeika: Ubuntu should work most excellently on Laptops, since that's what all of the developers use
[11:45] <chaosmeika> lemme double check what I dled...
[11:45] <sysrage> if i wanna give ubuntu a try on an older laptop (p3 900, only 386mb ram). should i try kubuntu, plain ubuntu, or what? i'm not new to linux, just wanna try a new distro
[11:45] <maxxism> narrchy i would make a new disc then.
[11:45] <narrchy> how should i do it this time?
[11:45] <maxxism> narrchy and download the iso again.  just in case.
[11:45] <russian-dude> I have 2 SATA HDDs, one has windows on it, another has Ubuntu. What do I need to do so i can choose what OS to boot?
[11:45] <sladen> sysrage: 386MB should be fine, although recent versions of Ubuntu start to get squashed in 256MB
[11:45] <dabaR> sysrage: try http://xubuntu.org/
[11:46] <chaosmeika> it would seem I have a copy od dapper drake
[11:46] <aribo> russian-dude you need to configure grub
[11:46] <chaosmeika> od=of
[11:46] <maxxism> russian-dude make your ubuntu drive the primary.  and learn to configure grub
[11:46] <sysrage> been running gentoo on it for years. slackware before that. so i know stuff will work, just curious if one of the flavors would be better
[11:46] <sladen> chaosmeika: 6.06 LTS ?
[11:46] <dabaR> sysrage: if you want a better performance than what you get with ubuntu. Try all three!
[11:46] <russian-dude> aribo how do i configure grub?
[11:47] <chaosmeika> sladen 6.06
[11:47] <masterninja> gaim randomly sarted working
[11:47] <sysrage> ah xfce.. not a huge fan. think i'll try normal ubuntu first
[11:47] <maxxism> masterninja  has a case of PEBKAC
[11:47] <sysrage> normal uses gnome.. kubuntu is kde, right?
[11:47] <dabaR> maxxism: heh.
[11:47] <masterninja> eh?
[11:47] <sysrage> by default of course
[11:47] <dabaR> sysrage: ya
[11:48] <masterninja> oi clever clogs
[11:48] <masterninja> how do i turn on xgl?
[11:48] <maxxism> PEBKAC = problem exists between keyboard and chair.
[11:48] <sorush20> hi, what program do I install in gnome to be able to add keyboard shortcuts to programs like gthumb nail viewer ?
[11:48] <sorush20> hi, what program do I install in gnome to be able to add keyboard shortcuts to programs like gthumb nail viewer ?

[11:49] <spunk_> My wifi card is up'n'running all fine, but I want to know which driver is used for it. How can I get that info?
[11:49] <sladen> chaosmeika: if there are any problems, please file a bug in launchpad
[11:49] <dabaR> spunk_: lsmod will show all modules which I think are drivers that are loaded on your machine.
[11:50] <sladen> dabaR: I have many packages installed, which one is of interest to you?  Personally I like a quick round of 'xbill'
[11:50] <narrchy> can i use a cd-r to burn ubuntu .iso?
[11:50] <russian-dude> aribo, it says it won't let me message you, i'm not registered
[11:50] <dabaR> sladen: I was trying to ask slawoszynski , but nicktab messed up
[11:50] <chaosmeika> it made an error and mentioned force=1 during install
[11:50] <dabaR> slawoszynski: what package did you install?
[11:50] <aribo> does someone know how to install an integrated ATI soundcard ?
[11:50] <spunk_> dabaR, ok. so there is no way to check which driver that is used for a particular network device?
[11:51] <aribo> from a DFI RS482
[11:51] <slawoszynski> first, on 6.06 postgresql only
[11:51] <narrchy> can i use a cd-r to burn a .iso
[11:51] <DevC> damn I fogot my password for root :o
[11:51] <narrchy> and how much space does the .iso take up?
[11:51] <dabaR> spunk_: I did not say that, I gave you a way to find out, I do not know whether or not there is a command for what you say
[11:51] <aribo> I run dapper
[11:51] <tonyyarusso> I need to know how to mount a device which shows up in /var/log/syslog as "Nov 25 17:48:42 experimental kernel: [78887.680000]  usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 5"
[11:51] <DevC> now I get to guess at it heh
[11:51] <spunk_> dabaR, ok
[11:51] <slawoszynski> but Im noob in ubuntu, and I remove it and I instaled postgres-8.1
[11:52] <pilibeen> can somebody give me the command to see a list of all running processes?
[11:52] <tonyyarusso> Any suggestions?
[11:52] <saxin> pilibeen: ps aux
[11:52] <slawoszynski> and I have no /etc/postgres directory, and no ubuntu
[11:52] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: is it a pen drive?
[11:52] <dabaR> slawoszynski: you have postgresql-8.1 installed?
[11:52] <welch> dadaR: how can i configure my ethernet card?
[11:52] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: Digital voice recorder, flash memory.
[11:53] <slawoszynski> yes
[11:53] <K^Holtz> a lot of my screensavers are just staying as blank screens... is the something wrong w/ my video settings or something?
[11:53] <dabaR> welch: skip the network setup installation step if it does not work, and work on getting the card set up after you install.
[11:53] <profoX`_> I am unable to ping/access a website on my linux box (i can't get its ip address resolved), all other websites work... on my other computer, I can visit the website though.. what could be wrong.. hosts file looks normal..
[11:53] <sladen> aribo: the sound card should work out of the box, is it enabled in the BIOS
[11:54] <profoX`_> both pc's have the same ip
[11:54] <profoX`_> (router)
[11:54] <profoX`_> same external ip i mean
[11:54] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: it should mount itself (if it's a usb masss storage device). to use the voice recording function, try selecting it as an alsa audio device
[11:54] <dabaR> profoX`_: but you can ping the sites IP address?
[11:54] <slawoszynski> on other ubuntu I : sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.1 postgresql-client-8.1 postgresql-doc-8.1 postgresql-server-dev-8.1
[11:54] <zerocool> hi every body
[11:54] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: I don't need to use it while connected, just transfer files.  (They're recorded as wav)
[11:54] <nolimitsoya> tips for a good audio metadata tagger are very wellcome :)
[11:54] <slawoszynski> and everythink is ok
[11:54] <sladen> tonyyarusso: if it's a Mass Storage Device, you'll need to mount   /dev/sdXYZ  , but this should happen automatically *if* it is indeed a USB Mass Storage Device (eg. flash, hard-disk...)
[11:54] <profoX`_> dabaR: yes, but I can't access the site through its ip address
[11:55] <theturtlemoves> hey, I've got a new Core 2 Duo laptop. what's the best kernel to use?
[11:55] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: doesn't it mount itself???
[11:55] <tonyyarusso> sladen: Nothing in /media - I'll check the /devs
[11:55] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: Doesn't look like it
[11:55] <sladen> profoX`_: sounds like an DNS issue.  check the contents of  /etc/resolv.conf
[11:55] <theturtlemoves> Should I try 64 bit, or is it still not so good?
[11:55] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: when you plug in, say, a pen drive, does it mount automatically?
[11:55] <sladen> profoX`_: trying deleting the first nameserver mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf so that the second one gets used
[11:55] <K^Holtz> a lot of my screensavers are just staying as blank screens... is the something wrong w/ my video settings or something?
[11:56] <sladen> tonyyarusso: things from  /dev/*  get _mounted_  onto  /media/*
[11:56] <profoX`_> well i can't ping it... it does 1 ping, and fails... and then I have 100% packet loss
=== mackenzie is now known as mackncheez3000
[11:56] <profoX`_> sladen: I can't ping the IP like I should
[11:56] <theturtlemoves> anyone?
[11:56] <profoX`_> sladen: it does 1 ping, and fails... and then I have 100% packet loss
[11:56] <sladen> theturtlemoves: unless you're doing heavy database work, you probably don't need the amd64 version
[11:56] <dabaR> sladen: being not able to resolve a domain name into its IP address, and not being able to access the same IP address in the browser sounds like a dns issue to you?
[11:56] <Lattyware> Could anyone help me with how I would go about encoding Anime (.mkvs, .avis, alot of xvid, h264, vorbis, etc...) to work on an ipod? I have Vive and a recompiled ffmpeg but it just fails on my anime (did get it to work with a random .mov I had lying around).
[11:56] <profoX`_> 55 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 54017ms
[11:56] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: Yes
[11:57] <sladen> profoX`_: lots of firewalls [incorrectly]  drop ICMP ping packets.  Can you successfully ping /any/ sites?
[11:57] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: dunno waht to do then. sorry :( i hope someone else can fix your problem
[11:57] <profoX`_> sladen: yes, I can ping all other sites..
[11:57] <sladen> profoX`_: then I wouldn't worry.
[11:57] <we2by> flash no sound
[11:57] <profoX`_> sladen: just not this one I am having trouble with (www.beryl-project.org)
[11:57] <we2by> any idea?
[11:57] <profoX`_> sladen: I'm not worrying, but I also can't access the website....
[11:57] <cafuego_> Lattyware: I have an ffmpeg apckage with the required support for mp4/aac output and a little shell script to convery stuff.
[11:57] <profoX`_> sladen: not with 2 different external IP's on this computer
[11:57] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: , sladen: There is no /dev/sd* for it
[11:58] <theturtlemoves> sladen: so the regular 686-smp should be fine?
[11:58] <dabaR> we2by: there is information on this in the restricted formats page under flash. Do you know where the page is?

[11:58] <nolimitsoya> !tag
[11:58] <sladen> profoX`_: www.beryl-project.org resolves to  195.14.0.203  for me, can you ping that IP directly?
[11:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tag - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:58] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: it probably isnt a mass storage device, but i've had an idea - how did you access it in windoze/mac?
[11:58] <nolimitsoya> whats the default application for handling audio metadata in ubuntu?
[11:58] <profoX`_> sladen: I already tried that, I am talking to the admin of beryl-project.org on IRC.. didnt work, thats the thing that gave me: 55 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 54017ms
[11:58] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: , sladen: Shows in 'lsusb' as Bus 002 Device 005: ID 07b4:020d Olympus Optical Co., Ltd Digital Voice Recorder VN-240PC
[11:58] <cafuego_> Lattyware: http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/dists/edgy-cafuego/ffmpeg/
[11:58] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: I didn't.  I don't have either.
[11:59] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: :s how does it say you should trnasfer files from it in windoze/mac
[11:59] <sladen> profoX`_: I suspect that www.beryl-project.org is served from many different servers, in a "round robin" fashion.  Perhaps the particular one you got given is currently down or doesn't accept ping packets
[11:59] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: , sladen: Which isn't actually the model number, but right brand
[11:59] <cafuego_> Lattyware: and http://www.cafuego.net/stuff/vidpod.sh
=== yama_away is now known as yama
[12:00] <profoX`_> sladen: well it must be the first problem, because I can't access it either?
[12:00] <tonyyarusso> alecjw: Win has an audio editor program that also handles the file transfer
[12:00] <profoX`_> (using a webbrowser)
[12:00] <Lattyware> cafuego_: Thanks, I will try that out.
[12:00] <SlimG> anyone? ut2004 won't start on a ati mobility 9700 laptop, something about missing GLX visual... here's the console output: http://pastebin.com/832850
[12:00] <Willa> !usenet
[12:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usenet - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:00] <cafuego_> Lattyware: I just tried it on a .mov from jy camera and it worked; mainly I use it on xvids here without any problems whatsoever.
=== asqueella__ is now known as asqueella
[12:00] <alecjw> tonyyarusso: was that a program which came with it? what was it?
[12:00] <sladen> alecjw: and that's supposed to show up as a hard-disk.  Do you need special software to access the device instead?
