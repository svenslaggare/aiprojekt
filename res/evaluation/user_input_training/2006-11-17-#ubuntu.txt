[12:01] <RASMAN> ailean, I use Evolution.  It has a bunch of plugins to do hula and stuff
[12:01] <bimberi> jerp: that's what i call it when it crashes (too often)
[12:01] <agent> bemixto: there has to be... your settings (that say your menu should be empty) are set somewhere ;)
[12:01] <jerp> :)
[12:01] <ailean> RASMAN, doesn't that force you to set up email too?
[12:01] <roxlu_> hi all
[12:01] <bimberi> :)
[12:01] <roxlu_> can someone maybe help me a bit with configuring my router for openvpn ?
[12:01] <agent> bemixto: check /usr/share/applications/ and see if there are a lot of *.desktop files... if so, that means that your system has the desktop files needed to prefill your menu
[12:02] <agent> indref: i think i found what you need
[12:02] <indref> agent, Sweetness.
[12:03] <kikokos> hello again maybe now sb help me
[12:03] <alberto_> hi
[12:03] <dcordes> how can i find out what my own ip is?
[12:03] <bemixto> agent: yes, there are lots
[12:03] <agent> indref: first you should note that you are using microsoft ebooks, not normal ebook fomat... this is why its so hard to find an answer to your question (1. no linux user would want to use ms format and 2. microsoft is not nice and is not willing to make it easy for linux)
[12:03] <dcordes> ..inside a local area network
[12:03] <kikokos> after ls -l /dev | grep [sh] d[abcd] 
[12:03] <indref> agent, Damn.
[12:03] <RASMAN> ailean, nope but if you don't want to use the email functions, you can always try to install sunbird from the website.
[12:03] <bemixto> agent: that's the point i do not understand
[12:03] <alberto_> where can I set default gnome music player?
[12:03] <indref> agent, Nothing I could do about it though. Go on.
[12:04] <bemixto> agent: it's there. but i still can't make them appear
[12:04] <agent> indref: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7975 is the article...
[12:04] <ailean> RASMAN, okay, thanks
[12:04] <kikokos>  after ls -l /dev | grep [sh] d[abcd]  i can see only : invalid options
[12:04] <RASMAN> ailean, Evolution is not very stable when I use it.  It has a lot of functionality but the exchange connector is always crapping out.
[12:04] <bimberi> dcordes: ifconfig
[12:04] <ailean> RASMAN, i found that before too
[12:04] <agent> bemixto: sorry, im helping someone else (plug trying to solve my own problem) so im not really able to help you further
[12:04] <indref> agent, Ok, is everything i need in the article?
[12:05] <nuts> howd I upgrade to latest nvidia beta drivers?
[12:05] <agent> indref: dont know... have not finished reading it yet
[12:05] <alberto_> where can I set default gnome music player?
[12:05] <bruenig> alberto_, right click on the filetype you want to change the default music player for, and then change the open with
[12:05] <agent> indref: there is a section on microsoft reader
[12:05] <bemixto> agent: ok, but thanks anyway
[12:05] <dope12345> i can't get ndiswrapper to install :(
[12:05] <bruenig> alberto_, doing so will change the application for all files like that
[12:05] <alberto_> bruenig: I want it for gnome keybindint manager
[12:05] <highneko> alberto_: /usr/share/applications/
[12:06] <indref> agent, Hmm, I'm looking. Seems a little thick for me.
[12:06] <agent> indref: it talks about "convert lit" program
[12:06] <dope12345> i don't think i can compile loadndisdriver
[12:06] <indref> agent, Fun. But where is it.
[12:06] <alberto_> I have an irda remote control and I want to configure it for launching banshee instead of default, rhtyhmbox
[12:06] <dope12345> i think it's something with the headers
[12:06] <agent> indref: looking....
[12:06] <epimer> hi guys
[12:07] <dope12345> can anyone help with linking these headers
[12:07] <epimer> what's that simpleprogram that gives you a dialog box for changing your splash screen?
[12:07] <bruenig> alberto_, there is one way to change it for sure but I don't know if it is the way that you are "supposed" to do it, you can just symlink the rhythmbox to banshee, so anytime the system tries to open rhythmbox it opens banshee instead
[12:07] <nothlit> Is there any reason why any additional X servers always skip vt8?
[12:07] <alberto_> bruenig: Thats very ugly
[12:08] <dcordes> bimberi: thx
[12:08] <bruenig> alberto_, ok, well just a thought
[12:08] <dope12345> how do i link headers
[12:08] <alberto_> thanks any way
[12:08] <dope12345> i get errors when i try to make the ndiswrapper
[12:08] <kikokos> I use live cd verion on another comp, but I dont remember IP and Gateway mask etc, where ubuntu save thic?
[12:08] <bruenig> alberto_, you could use xbindkeys to make another keybind specifically for banshee instead of trying to use the default media player one gnome gives you
[12:08] <kikokos> live it`s run but on the HDD with completed ubuntu

[12:23] <Zaehlas> Hello, I could use some help troubleshooting postfix.  I've set up a mail server with multiple domains, and virtual users, using the setup help located at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixVirtualMailBoxClamSmtpHowto.  After checking all the settings, configuration files, and even using WireShark to scan the traffic coming in, email will come in, but it is not being sent to the appropriate directory.  It's being "swallowed" by post
[12:24] <bum> type them with "./" at the beginning
[12:24] <zambonie> dcordes: not familiar with the samba method, but in windows you could do it with the "net use" command.
[12:24] <Zaehlas> Is there any way to see a diagnostic of what postfix is doing to recieved mail through SMTP?
[12:24] <_goofy_>  does anyone know of a program to test the stability of a cpu within the ubuntu gui

[12:24] <agent> indref: where did you extract that file to?
[12:24] <agent> indref: the directory where you extracted those files
[12:24] <dcordes> zambonie: well i want to connect from my ubuntu to the windows box. not the other way around.
[12:24] <indref> agent, Dumped it to the desktop.
[12:25] <dcomsa> dcordes: share the files normally on the windows machine
[12:25] <dcomsa> dcordes: and then go to Places -> Network Servers
[12:26] <bLaZeD> dcomsa, use dameware or somting
[12:26] <agent> indref: when you are in the folder where you extracted the files, can you  right-click-> open in terminal?

[12:26] <dcordes> dcomsa: i forgot the screensaver password of my windows box so i can't share. otherwise i wouldn't ask :-)
[12:26] <indref> agent, I'm doing the other one now.
[12:26] <agent> indref: but were there any errors? warnings are usually ok

[12:27] <Infamous_Flame> anyone? lol
[12:27] <bunnythebunny> Zaehlas, post it in the forum.
[12:27] <zambonie> dcordes: it may work similar to the following:  smbmount //User:password@workgroupordomain/windowsbox/c /mnt/wherever
[12:27] <bunnythebunny> :)
[12:27] <indref> agent, The second one seemed wrong.
[12:27] <gouchi> froggontherocks : less /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/ALSA-Configuration.txt.gz and check options to add for hda intel to /etc/modprobe/sound

[12:27] <indref> agent, The readme said to go to a dir that wasn't there.
[12:28] <Zaehlas> dcordes: I used to have an old linux floppy that you could boot from to force windows password changes.   If you aren't hacking someone elses system, it should be available on the net.  I just don't remember how to find it, sorry.

[12:31] <agent> indref: yes, i got that error too.. trying to find a proper deb package already made for you
[12:31] <Madhouze> can anybody please help - every time i try to run any type of program/game full screen my xserver crashes- i only get a black screen and my monitor goes off. i can still change to other VTs but cant do a thing on VT7.... HELP!!!???
[12:31] <dcomsa> fzito: be a little more specific
[12:31] <bum> did you try sudo aptitude install network-manager?
[12:32] <indref> agent, Is it always like this.
[12:32] <agent> indref: http://ace-host.stuart.id.au/russell/files/debian/sarge/clit/
[12:32] <fzito> I installed the package via commend prompt and the run command for the applet doesn't work
[12:32] <fzito> it does not initiate the applet
[12:32] <Jack_Sparrow> dcordes: use the shields up scanner at grc.com
[12:32] <bunnythebunny> Madhouze, could it be related to your graphic drivers? I don't know im a uber newb myself.
[12:32] <bum> fzito are you using gnome?
[12:32] <indref> agent, Ok, I see a handful of files..
[12:33] <agent> indref: no... you see, this program has legal troubles.... what you are trying to do is not very legal in some countries because microsoft wants it that way.... thats the problem with using locked file formats like microsfots
[12:33] <Madhouze> i have the NVidia drivers installed.
[12:33] <fzito> not sure  how can I tell - pardon the ignorance I just switched from ms xp
[12:33] <agent> indref: clit_1.8-1_i386.deb  <-- thats the one you want
[12:33] <dcomsa> Madhouze: maybe you monitor doesn't support the refresh rate
[12:33] <indref> agent, Legality is an opinion. My opinion differs than most.
[12:33] <Phuzion> if I download the EDGY CD, can I just run all the apt-get from the CD as a repository to upgrade from dapper?
[12:33] <bimberi> fzito: it will have "About Gnome" in the System menu

[12:34] <bunnythebunny> Madhouze, What was the last thing you did before those issues started ocurring?
[12:34] <indref> agent, I see the problem.
[12:34] <bum> try using synaptic to get it and look at the recommended files
[12:34] <agent> indref: what are you running?
[12:34] <Madhouze> dcomsa,  i dont think its that - becuz i can sometimes see the cursor blinking in the top left corner of the screen before it goes blank... and i think that sometimes i can here the ubuntu drums....
[12:34] <Madhouze> bunnythebunny, i wish i knew.
[12:34] <indref> agent, What I don't see why nothing outside this offical group works.
[12:34] <fzito> gnome is loaded
[12:35] <indref> agent, The i689 or something.
[12:35] <agent> indref: thats the same thing
[12:35] <Fred_Sambo> windows runs better on my virtual machine on ubuntu than it ran on the machine itself
[12:35] <indref> agent, If its the same thing, then why are they called different.
[12:35] <agent> indref: unless you are on a mac (ppc) or on 64bit amd than use i386
[12:35] <dcomsa> Madhouze: :)) the thing about hearing the drums is funny :)
[12:35] <Madhouze> oh and it happens both on my gnome and my KDE

[12:36] <Jack_Sparrow> Guys, hate to admit this, but I have wallowed in XP for the last couple months and now want to get Dapper working. Specifically how do I determine what I still need to get DVD's to play?
[12:36] <agent> indref: ok... to be more exact, they are not the same thing... but 386 is compatible with anything above it like 686, but not the other way around.... makes sense?
[12:36] <bum> for dvds libdvdcss2 and w32codecs should do it
[12:36] <indref> agent, No, but again I will take your word for it.
[12:36] <Madhouze> any idea where i should go look for help with this?
[12:36] <bum> the freecontrib repository has both I think

[12:38] <CaptainMorgan> should I upgrade to Edgy? last month when I was here, all I witnessed was vast amounts of problems and that maybe it was rushed.... since Dapper is the LTS, should I stick with it?

[12:42] <Factory> Hey, could someone point me in the direction of a disk format/partitioning step-by-step? I'm pretty new to this
[12:42] <bum> the command "startx" will work as long as your old x server isn't running, if it is you have to kill the process

[12:42] <agent> indref: just so you know, the people behind debian (ubuntu uses mostly debian packages/programs) already know about this and they did not include it because of legal issues (i just read about it)

[12:42] <agent> indref: ?
[12:43] <bum> the command should be nm-applet
[12:43] <Juanchito2006> Where's the sheep when needed?
[12:43] <indref> agent, There are plenty of completely illegal programs around. Usually you just run them :\

[12:47] <JoshJ> do rm -r dir

[12:47] <JoshJ> be careful with this as screwing that up (say with rm -r * or rm -r /) can really screw up your system
[12:47] <agent> indref: its a command line program... type man clit
[12:48] <agent> indref: that will give you the manual
[12:48] <bum> double check that the mic volume isn't down ...
[12:48] <indref> agent, Okie doke.
[12:48] <Frogg> i've done that it's all the way up
[12:48] <fzito> I went to the directory and I received no such file
[12:48] <agent> indref: i dont know how to use it since i never used it nor do i have it.... my guess is this is how you use it: clit <your clit file>
[12:48] <bum> sometimes what ubuntu says is the mic isn't really the one your using...try turning all the volumes up
[12:48] <JoshJ> there's a clit command in linux?
[12:48] <JoshJ> any relation to fsck?
[12:48] <Frogg> Done that
[12:48] <Frogg> everything is up
[12:49] <agent> indref: i think by default clit just converts the lit file to an open ebook that you can use anywhere
[12:49] <Frogg> What i would really like to get working is my Linksys CIT200 but i understand that can't happen even though it sees that too
[12:49] <indref> agent, Let's hope so, I'm giving it a go..
[12:49] <agent> JoshJ: clit = covertlit = converts crap microsoft drm ebook .lit files :D
[12:49] <JoshJ> nice!
[12:51] <bum> did you read the documentation for the linksys cit200?
[12:51] <Frogg> There wasn't any mention on using it under linksys
[12:51] <martyyyr> you guys wanna hear something stupid?
[12:51] <Frogg> windows i mean
[12:51] <Juanchito2006> Sorry but this info you gave me is not clear, I'm a newb

[12:52] <Jack_Sparrow> bum: gxine will play dvd'd but not totem?  any suggestions?
[12:52] <bum> I see Linksys's official position is that it doesn't work w/linux since there are no drivers
[12:52] <JoshJ> lol, emacs has everything -_-
[12:52] <agent> indref: pretty easy, eh?
[12:52] <Fred_Sambo> yes, tetris in emacs
[12:53] <bum> personally I would just not use totem...
[12:53] <Jack_Sparrow> cute
[12:53] <bum> I tend towards vlc or mplayer
[12:53] <JoshJ> Xine here :)
[12:53] <indref> agent, That option is not in the right-click menu.
[12:53] <agent> indref: just dont right-click on a file
[12:53] <JoshJ> i think you need a package to do that
[12:53] <Jack_Sparrow> not a biggie...
[12:53] <Legion> as far as I can tell, deciding between Gnome and KDE is like arguing about what color a car should have

[01:12] <dope12345> where do i get advanced help
[01:12] <hou5ton> I really need to get this modem working on this laptop ... need it at the hospital and only have dialup there ....  I have done "sudo pppconfig" but it can't find the modem on any COM ???

[01:13] <bum> AGENT: http://www.wifi.com.ar/english/cdrouter.html for linux boot w/ssh

[01:13] <Ricardo_Colombia> Can somebody tell me where is gPhoto?
[01:13] <agent> dope12345: its not really that advanced, its just that you are using hardware that does not like to play nice with ubuntu and my guess would be there are not very many people in this channel that use your particular hardware... forums may be better for such questions
[01:14] <agent> bum: great! im trying to install without monitor, keyboard or mouse! ;)
[01:14] <Suavsilk> highneko, i cant play AVI files
[01:14] <highneko> BrightEyes`: If you're looking for the graphical thing like suse has, I think there's a different package.
[01:14] <Ricardo_Colombia> Can somebody tell me where is gPhoto?

[01:16] <highneko> Suavsilk: That's a common problem. wget http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/essential-20061022.tar.bz2 then extract them to the folder /usr/lib/win32
[01:16] <Spee_Der> hou5ton: I can't help you with the immediate problem, but from hosptal experience, most of them these days have available internet access.....
[01:16] <bum> it works for me in xubuntu you'll see network icons
[01:16] <BrightEyes`> highneko: anyone who nows?
[01:16] <hou5ton> Spee_Der:   not this one
[01:16] <hou5ton> I wish
[01:16] <bruenig> Ricardo_Colombia, it is command line, not graphical
[01:16] <Spee_Der> Sorry to 'ear that.....
[01:16] <Spee_Der> Good luck also.
[01:16] <highneko> BrightEyes`: You want the graphical thing like suse I mentioned?
[01:16] <pxlmdk> hi, i just got a fancy new logitech mouse, about half the buttons seem to work, is there something special i should do to install drivers or something or is it simply not fully compatible?
[01:17] <Ricardo_Colombia> Can you recommend me a graphic software for cameras?
[01:17] <hou5ton> If there is a place to plug in the phone line on this laptop, and I see the connections in there, does that mean there is surely a modem in there?
[01:17] <pxlmdk> yes houston it does mean that.
[01:17] <bum> its a photo manager

[01:21] <JoshJ> dunno how though
[01:21] <JoshJ> sorry :(
[01:21] <JoshJ> never had to do that
[01:21] <ivx> dope12345 why can't you use that
[01:21] <Spee_Der> hou5ton: In terminal window 'sudo apt-get install hwinfo'
[01:21] <dope12345> cause my wireless doesn't work
[01:21] <chivosolar> bum, hey there, my daughter dragged me away and your input scrolled up past the screen

[01:21] <dope12345> i can d/l stuff on windows and access it in linux but the wireless doesn't work in linux at the moment.
[01:21] <dope12345> i'm trying to fix that
[01:21] <JoshJ> heh
[01:21] <JoshJ> the classic catch-22
[01:21] <ivx> dope12345 well then the package manager prolly won't work either
[01:22] <JoshJ> ...dpkg would work without a net connection
[01:22] <JoshJ> dope12345: what wireless card is it? broadcom?
[01:22] <chivosolar> bum, is there a page info link to review the network printer setup?
[01:22] <markus> I'm setting up ubuntu on a different comp right now and was wondering how I should layout my partition. I have a 160GB drive that will need FAT32 space to share with windows, which is on a separate drive (music, pictures, etc for the FAT32), 1GB RAM, and the system will have four users
[01:22] <dope12345> yea broadcom
[01:22] <JoshJ> yeah figured :(
[01:22] <dope12345> i just wanna install ndiswrapper
[01:22] <dope12345> i should use dpkg?
[01:22] <ivx> dope12345 what card do you have 4318?
[01:22] <JoshJ> well, you have to GET the ndiswrapper file
[01:22] <JoshJ> hrm
[01:22] <highneko> Suavsilk: No, the full path is /usr/lib/win32
[01:22] <dredhammer> hi can someone tell me how to install stuff in Wine?
[01:23] <JoshJ> dredhammer : load up a console and do "wine filename.exe" where filename.exe is the installer file
[01:23] <dope12345> i have the ndiswrapper.tar.gz file
[01:23] <highneko> Suavsilk: sudo mkdir /usr/lib/win32; sudo mv essential-20061022/* /usr/lib/win32
[01:23] <JoshJ> (get in the right folder etc first)
[01:23] <Suavsilk> highneko ok, how can i extract what i downloaded?
[01:23] <Suavsilk> highneko ok will do
[01:23] <dredhammer> so it can't run from the cd drive then?
[01:23] <JoshJ> you can
[01:23] <JoshJ> just cd to /dev/cdrom0 or whatever
[01:24] <JoshJ> dunno where your cd is  set up

I don't know the sizes I need of partitions such as /,/home,etc.
[01:25] <highneko> Suavsilk: Ok, that's good that it exists. You gotta move the extracted files to the folder /usr/lib/win32. I do'nt know the command to extract files, I usually use my file browser for that.

[01:51] <jmichaelx> has anyone here been successful in getting embedded video (Yahoo! news clips, for example) working using FF2.0 and mplayer plugin? i have not been able to get them to work in k/ubuntu edgy, though they worked fine in dapper, with FF1.5. i also just noticed that such videos work fine in mepis 6.0 & FF2.0. if anyone has a solution, please let me know.
[01:51] <hikenboot> nope it dont start
[01:51] <hikenboot> even on boot
[01:51] <eetfunk> der0b: the files were created the first time i installed apache, not by me
[01:51] <highneko> hikenboot: Maybe if you have no more panels left, I would try executing "gnome-panel".
[01:52] <der0b> eetfunk: I would tar them up in case you need them, remove them manually and do a reinstall
[01:52] <dcordes> highneko: oh that looks very complex!
[01:53] <eetfunk> it worked now... after 10 tries :)
[01:53] <JuJuBee> Anybody able to help me with vnc?  I installed tightvnc on my windows box.  I started the server and I can ping the computer by ip.  On my ubuntu box,  when I use vncviewer and enter the ip address of the windows box, it never prompts me for a password. I just hangs there curser blinking like it is thinking
[01:53] <birdfish> If I leave some space at the end of the harddrive unpartitioned during install, how hard is it to partition later?
[01:53] <der0b> eetfunk: cool eetfunk
[01:53] <overridex> birdfish: not hard if you leave it empty like that, it's resizing that's annoying
[01:53] <deema> how long should Kismet take to compile on a 500 mhz machine?
[01:53] <hikenboot> highneko, thanks will try that
[01:54] <Trixsey> How's programming in C# in Ubuntu? :P
[01:54] <birdfish> overridex: ah, sweet =)
[01:54] <jimcooncat> JuJuBee, I'm using UltraVNC as a server on my Windows box, I like it
[01:54] <Trixsey> Is there C# compilers for Ubuntu? I can compile to exe and use WINE right
[01:54] <Trixsey> ?
[01:54] <herbert> you have to use mono
[01:54] <herbert> for coding c#
[01:55] <herbert> and the mono framework
[01:55] <JuJuBee> jimcooncat : Ok, but I dont know if the problem is with the windows box or my ubuntu box.
[01:55] <JuJuBee> I  wondered if there was a way to test the server remotely to see if it is even listening for conntections.

[02:04] <johnm1019> anyone know how to get screen gestures in edgy?
[02:04] <akk> Is there an approved way (like, through the gui rather than typing ifup) to start a network in xubuntu?
[02:05] <Pupeno> Hello.
[02:05] <jimcooncat> JuJuBee, you alive? I'd give you some help but supper's calling
[02:05] <jatt> akk: with gkrellm. What do you mean with "approved"?
[02:06] <jrib> johnm1019: I know of 'wayv' but configuration isn't that easy.  I just stick to gestures in my web browser
[02:06] <akk> jatt: I'm just trying to do things like a normal user would, instead of using a terminal to edit /etc/network/interfaces then type ifconfig and ifup and so forth.
[02:06] <akk> jatt: I'm wondering if there is a way that a normal user could use, before I go replacing /etc/network/* with my own files like I've done in the past.
[02:06] <johnm1019> jrib: ok, because in dapper they are part of the preferences menu -- i wasn't sure why that had disapeared
[02:07] <Staz> Hi I have 4 sata disks I want on JBOD, how can I go about this?
[02:07] <jrib> johnm1019: the gnome preferences menu?
[02:10] <Clin1>  I need help fixing my printer... Ubuntu detacted it aand installed it but when i send aa print job it stops automaticaly
[02:10] <jatt> akk: I had very bad experiences with gnome applets which try to configure the network. Many of those applets are unable to read existing configurations. To start a network connection from the gui, I would recommend gkrellm again. You can define start and stop commands that will be executed when the user press a button (e.g. you can define start command as pon internet-provider). To *configure* the network, the most reliable way to do it
[02:10] <jatt> is changing the configuration files themselves with an editor.
[02:10] <jatt> IMO
[02:11] <akk> jatt: Okay, thanks. The built-in network configuration worked okay but I guess I'll stick to typing ifup eth0 (which does work) to start it.
[02:13] <akk> It's funny that ubuntu is so good about most desktop things, but then configuring the network is all editing config files and typing commands.

[02:17] <birdfish> Hm, actually, nevermind.  I thought that ubuntu 6.06 was still utilizing the 2.4 kernel.  This problem is in relation to a broken driver not interacting properly with the 2.6 kernel

[02:19] <variant> akk: so you cant sudo?
[02:19] <Clin1> My bad its lexmark
[02:19] <akk> variant: Right. I do have other partitions on this machine, so I could reboot and touch a file if that would help.

[02:20] <variant> akk: there is a noother way to fix it..
[02:20] <Clin1> Do you know what to do
[02:20] <akk> variant: This is a brand new install. But I did have to pull the power cord twice when it hung starting X (because it enables 3d on an S3 savage card)
[02:21] <variant> akk: whats wrong withthat?
[02:21] <akk> Here's what to do with a lexmark: http://timocharis.com/doodles/lexmark/
[02:21] <akk> variant: Known bug, 3d stuff always hangs on s3 savage. It's been in the ubuntu bug system for ages, too.
[02:21] <variant> ah
[02:22] <variant> akk: sorry, i cant remember how to fix that error
[02:22] <akk> variant: Happens on quite a few other cards, too, so you have to comment out the dri line in xorg.conf
[02:22] <variant> google it
[02:23] <akk> haha, someone on the forum discussion says "I think it's a security measure"

[02:29] <mangojambo> at last ... a bot give me an answer ... lol
[02:29] <wasp_ems> nkassi, do u know what i can do to find out or solve it?
[02:29] <akk> Captain_ath0: echo $PATH will give you the list of directories in your path.
[02:29] <nkassi> wasp_ems: Do you have the binary drivers installed for your type of card ?
[02:29] <wasp_ems> nkassi, not sure
[02:30] <akk> Captain_ath0: Probably none of them are in your homedir, unless you've set your path yourself to include it.
[02:30] <nkassi> wasp_ems: Maybe, what type of card do you have ATI or Nvidia ?
[02:30] <Madhouze> I have a problem: whenever i run a program/game in full screen, my xserver crashes, my monitor goes off and i hear the ubuntu drums. then i can still go to other VTs but can do nothing with VT7. i have NVidia drivers installed.

[02:33] <MarcN> markus: not terribly.  Usually /boot and / are the first two, then swap then the rest.
[02:33] <nkassi> wasp_ems: good then you don't have the drivers. At least we know ;0)

[02:34] <markus> one other question, does it matter if my partitions are logical or primary, whats the differnce
[02:35] <flodine> help i need to add a drive to ubuntu can someone help
[02:35] <dope12345> yea, can't use apt
[02:35] <dope12345> how would i install the build essentials without apt
[02:35] <nkassi> flodine: mount /dev/hda* /directory/to/mount/too
[02:35] <Falstius> dope12345: why can't you use apt?
[02:35] <nkassi> flodine: the * being the partition number
[02:35] <dope12345> cause wireless doesn't work on linux at the moment
[02:35] <bimberi> dope12345: using 'sudo dpkg -i file.deb'
[02:35] <nkassi> flodine: if you have sata it will be sda*
[02:35] <jrib> dope12345: the build-essential package is on the cd
[02:35] <MarcN> markus: you can only have 4 primary partitions (I usually use them for /boot and /) but you can have a lot of logical partitions
[02:36] <dope12345> oh it is?
[02:36] <markus> ok, thanks
[02:36] <jrib> dope12345: yeah, just add the cd-rom as a repository and you should be able to install it with apt
[02:36] <flodine> nkassi can that be done with gparted
[02:36] <dope12345> well i have the iso
[02:36] <dope12345> is there a way to mount the iso?
[02:36] <green_earz> flodine:  to find out the partions number use the command sudo fdisk -l
[02:37] <nkassi> flodine: no actually, gparted will help you create and delete partitions.
[02:37] <Falstius> dope12345: sudo mout -o loop ubuntu.iso /media/cdrom/
[02:37] <nkassi> flodine: the mount command is what you would use to mount the partition once created and formated
[02:37] <dope12345> ah nice
[02:37] <agent> mount, not mout :)
[02:37] <Falstius> (just don't try putting another cdrom in, or use a different mount directory)
[02:37] <Falstius> agent: bah :)
[02:37] <dope12345> how do i add it as a repository?
[02:37] <nkassi> flodine: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount?highlight=%28mount%29
[02:38] <nkassi> flodine: much more details there
[02:38] <Falstius> dope12345: modify /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:38] <jrib> dope12345: sudo apt-cdrom add    not sure if you'll need to specify the path explicitly now (check the man page)
[02:38] <bimberi> dope12345: Edit menu in Synaptic
[02:39] <nkassi> dopel12345: you can mount the iso using : mount -o loop /path/to/iso /mount/point
[02:39] <wasp_ems> nkassi, but the site u gave me mentions ati cards which i do not have..mine i think is earlier
[02:39] <dope12345> all right, thx for all the help. i'm gonna see if i can get this to work now
[02:39] <dope12345> brb maybe
[02:39] <wasp_ems> nkassi, should i go ahead anyway?

[02:40] <MrBunny> I'm getting a "freqency out of range" error after I log in with my eMachines monitor after I updated from 6.06 and rebooted,  help please.
[02:40] <wasp_ems> nkassi, ati radeon 345m igp
[02:41] <wasp_ems> nkassi, from what i read it is in the supported list by xgl
[02:41] <nkassi> wasp_ems: then try the driver install anyways, I believe it should work
[02:41] <wasp_ems> nkassi, ok thanx
[02:41] <nkassi> wasp_ems: The mobile Ati cards have odd name
[02:42] <wasp_ems> nkassi, well tell me good luck

[02:57] <crimsun> Iceman_B: use the alternate installer (text-based) instead
[02:57] <Falstius> Iceman_B: you can use the "alternative" cd
[02:58] <Iceman_B> ah, alright
[02:58] <Falstius> downloadable from the same place
[02:58] <Iceman_B> thanks
[02:59] <bimberi> variant: yes, i'm not sure sorry, I've seen that recommended for the ./configure/make/make-install dance.  if /usr/bin/gcc points to /etc/alternatives/???? then update-alternatives would be the way
[02:59] <user-land> i just installed the game 'Search and Rescue' via synaptic, how can i start it ?
[02:59] <ISOLATEDViRuS> im trying to mount my ipod, and i cant get it to work

[02:59] <eiersalat> lol thx
[02:59] <Pelo> user-land,  it should be in the menu under games
[02:59] <eiersalat> :-L
[03:00] <ISOLATEDViRuS> can someone help me mount it?
[03:00] <rasman> user-land, you can run 'dpkg -L packagename' to get an idea of what files were installed
[03:00] <variant> bimberi: ln -sf /usr/bin/gcc-3.4 /usr/bin/gcc did the trick
[03:00] <Pupeno> Does Ubuntu Edgy come with the same version of Gnome as Ubuntu Breezy ?
[03:00] <bimberi> variant: indeed it should have :)
[03:00] <variant> bimberi: damn lol, same error  om make :)
[03:00] <dnite> Pupeno, no.
[03:00] <Pelo> ISOLATEDViRuS,  there should be instructions in the forum for that I am sure
[03:00] <Madhouze> can anyone help me with my xserver crashing?
[03:00] <dnite> Pupeno, 2.16.1 vs 2.14
[03:00] <user-land> pelo, do you have it there ?
[03:00] <ISOLATEDViRuS> what forum?
[03:00] <bimberi> variant: :/
[03:00] <overridex> anyone here use jackfield for desklets?  just curious of how it is...
[03:00] <eiersalat> is there a way to set gnome language via CLI
[03:00] <variant> /usr/src/modules/unionfs/missing_vfs_funcs.h:33: error: structure has no member named `i_sem'
[03:01] <variant> etc
[03:01] <ISOLATEDViRuS> ive done it before, i just dont remember how i did it, i think i edited fstab or mtab
[03:01] <bimberi> eww
[03:01] <Pelo> user-land,   I don'T have games on my computer
[03:01] <variant> !unionfs
[03:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about unionfs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:02] <Pelo> user-land,  do you know the name of the package ?  try using that in the terminal
[03:02] <eiersalat> hello ????
[03:02] <eiersalat> is tehre a way to set the gnome langugae via terminal ?
[03:02] <Pelo> eiersalat, ???
[03:03] <rasman> ISOLATEDViRuS, you will need to have your ipod set to mount like a hard-drive.  It is somewhere in the settings menu.
[03:03] <eiersalat> will setting al locales to new language do the trick ?
[03:03] <highneko> user-land: it might be in the Main Menu -> Games
[03:03] <rasman> ISOLATEDViRuS, then you will need to see if your system recognizes it 'lsusb' will tell you what equipment is plugged into your usb
[03:03] <Pelo> eiersalat,  yes there is, but I don'T know what it is for sure,  try   apt-cache search  "language name here"  and see what language packs come up , one of them is bound to be the pack for gnome
[03:04] <eiersalat> i ve installed them
[03:04] <eiersalat> Pelo, language-pack-nds -base -gnome-nds and gnome-nds-base i ve installed
[03:04] <user-land> rasman, thanks: /usr/share/menu/searchandrescue , but when i call it terminal says command not found.
[03:04] <Pelo> eiersalat,   I don'T know from there, that was all I had to contribute
[03:04] <eiersalat> but is there no "low german" or "low saxon" in the GUI where to chooce langugage
[03:05] <eiersalat> ok , but thanks :)
[03:05] <eiersalat> schei gnome :(
[03:05] <rasman> <user-land>, what happens when you type 'search<tab>'
[03:06] <Pelo> eiersalat,  why can'T you using the language support app from  system > admin ?  if you are in gnome already
[03:06] <babo> Isn't there a wiki out there for different cities across the world ?
[03:06] <babo> like a travellors wiki or something ...
[03:06] <rasman> <user-land>, tab completion should make sure that there are no typos
[03:06] <eiersalat> Pelo, the nds langugae is not in the list there
[03:06] <user-land> ah, rasman pelo and highneko, thanks, it is 'SearchAndRescue' :-)
[03:06] <Pelo> eiersalat, it might not be available
[03:06] <eiersalat> it is
[03:06] <user-land> pity it can not be added to the menu though.
[03:07] <eiersalat> there is a gnome nds language pack, Pelo
[03:07] <eiersalat> like for de or en
[03:07] <user-land> mmmh, eiersalat :-)
[03:07] <rasman> <user-land>, you can add it to the desktop by right-clicking and creating a Launcher
[03:07] <beo> anyone know why a dig camera wont be seen by ubuntu... or rather why it wont dl the pics?
[03:07] <eiersalat> :)
[03:07] <Pelo> eiersalat,  try looking in the forum for help maybe you'll find something there
[03:08] <eiersalat> yep i do already :)
[03:08] <eiersalat> thanks again Pelo :)
[03:08] <Pelo> hey, no help , no problem
[03:08] <highneko> beo: It might be a setting in your camera. I once changed a setting on my camera and then my computers wouln't download anything from it.
[03:09] <Pelo> !flash9
[03:09] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[03:10] <david_> Hello every one I am new to ubuntu and wanted to introduce myself
[03:10] <beo> highneko, its a kodak P850 and it isnt recognised by digikam in gnome here but it worked fine and was recognised by the same program in Suse KDE digikam
[03:10] <user-land> unfortunately the game has massive problems here, had to force quit it.
[03:10] <rasman> eiersalat, have you tried running 'update-locale' or 'dpkg --configure belocs-locales-bin'
[03:10] <fivre> I got X to run under Edgy, but I can't right-click anymore. What do I do?
[03:10] <david_> could I ask for some help with qtparted?
[03:10] <eiersalat> oooh thx rasman,. i ll give a tryd
[03:11] <eiersalat> one thing i ve to say:
[03:11] <highneko> beo: When you plugin your camera are you asked if you want to upload iamges without digicam?
[03:11] <eiersalat> the gnome langugage choosing GUI is crap
[03:11] <eiersalat> its also not translated
[03:11] <fivre> that might explain why I have en-AU
[03:11] <rasman> david_, hey david
[03:11] <fivre> hey, middle click doesn't work either!
[03:11] <eiersalat> sry not intended to flame, but its not good, especially that the langugage list isnt translated
[03:12] <rasman> david_, I'm more familiar with gparted
[03:12] <david_> I installed qtparted to formate a sata drive that shows on my desktop
[03:12] <rasman> eiersalat, that's why the terminal is king :)
[03:12] <eiersalat> cause i dont know waht "plattdeutsch" or "niederdeutsch" (nds) is in english
[03:13] <eiersalat> yeah rasman
[03:13] <beo> highneko,   yea, by the default gnome app telling me there are photos to be dl'd then when I tell it to do that  there was an error in the IO library and it couldnot claim the interface
[03:13] <beo> Operation not permitted
[03:13] <eiersalat> that is why i asked for a nasty CLI command to switch the language, rasman, i will try your suggestions now :)
[03:13] <rasman> david_, what happens when you start qtparted?
[03:13] <david_> when trying applications, system tools qtparted I get no device found maybe your not using root as user
[03:13] <Pelo> beo try doing it as root,  just for testing
[03:14] <beo> how? when I try to log in as root, I gettold that root cannot log in
[03:14] <rasman> david_, run the command as 'sudo qtparted' to elevate your priviledges
[03:14] <sethk> beo, you can use sudo.  or you can set the root password and root will be allowed to log in
[03:14] <david_> do I do that in a terminal?
[03:15] <rasman> david_, terminal or press F2 and type it in there
[03:15] <beo> k thanks, Ill try sudo
[03:15] <Pelo> beo,  what ever application you use to access your camera ,  start if from the terminal with gksu  applicaiton-name
[03:15] <user-land> yes, language list not being translated struck me as showing plainly that Ubuntu is not ready for prime time.
[03:15] <luminousnerd> The Readme says to ./configure
[03:15] <luminousnerd> But yet: luminousnerd@LumiPuter:~/e17/libs/eet$ ./configure
[03:15] <luminousnerd> bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
[03:15] <rasman> david_, gparted has a shortcut to sudo gparted listed under 'System --> Administration'
[03:15] <david_> I ran in terminal had errors but opened qtparted  showing drives.
[03:16] <rasman> david_, what errors?
[03:16] <luminousnerd> Is that something funky with Ubuntu or is something wrong?
[03:16] <david_> ransom, can I copy and paste it into this forum
[03:17] <rasman> luminousnerd, make sure that you are in the root directory of that application
[03:17] <matro> Hello there is a deb of makehuman for ubuntu but it is not in the add remove apps list how do I install software that is not on the list. And yes I am new to Ubuntu
[03:17] <luminousnerd> I am, and ls shows that the closest thing to configure is configure.in
[03:17] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  did you install build-essential first ?
[03:17] <eiersalat> user-land its not ubuntu, its gnome i think
[03:17] <luminousnerd> Pelo: no, not that I know of
[03:17] <david_>  Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 166
[03:18] <luminousnerd> apt-get install build-essentials?
[03:18] <david_>  Major opcode:  144
[03:18] <rasman> david_, that may be due to a device that is plugged in but not recognizable
[03:18] <rasman> david_, can you format the drive?
[03:18] <jamin06> can someone explain the make command for me
[03:18] <Pelo> luminousnerd,   use synaptic ,  search and install build-essential  you need that to compile manualy
[03:18] <david_> okay that makes sense it had a windows os on it in ntfs file system
[03:18] <user-land> eiersalat, ubuntu claimed they would give back to the sources ...
[03:18] <luminousnerd> synaptic?
[03:18] <david_> I am going to try formating now
[03:18] <beo> ran the gksu and it opened root owner for digikam but still wont allow it to be seen
[03:19] <nomasteryoda|w> !tell Pelo about make
[03:19] <jamin06> no me
[03:19] <nomasteryoda|w> jamin06, just sec
[03:19] <Falstius> jamin06: make is basically a scripting language that is used for determing how to compile programs.  You can read more in the man page or online.
[03:19] <jamin06> thanks
[03:19] <rc-1> if i cant complie with gcc how do i fix path
[03:19] <Pelo> jamin06,  when compiling a app from souce manualy,  /configure check to make sure the dependencies are installed,  make  creates and instal file  and make install installs it
[03:19] <luminousnerd> Says I already have it, Pelo
[03:20] <Pelo> luminousnerd,   system > admin > synaptic package manager
[03:20] <sethk>   ./configure, not /configure
[03:20] <jamin06> ok heres the deal. got a folder on desktop. it has a makefile. i need to "make"
[03:20] <Pelo> nomasteryoda,  I wasn'T the one asking
[03:20] <rasman> jamin06, usually you need to run './configure' first
[03:20] <nomasteryoda|w> oops
[03:20] <Pelo> jamin06,  other then that minor mistake can you find anything wrong with my explanantion ?
[03:20] <david_> rasman, I am trying to delete the partitions but won't allow me says it is mounted
[03:21] <luminousnerd> Okay so if ./configure isn't working and I've got the latest build essential, what not?
[03:21] <luminousnerd> *now
[03:21] <AngryElf> hey guys, i'm using ndiswrapper over a wireless connection and there's a noticeable lag on every connection, which if fine, except for ssh which timesout too soon........any way around this?
[03:21] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  look in the application folder for a readme file or an install file  ,  open them as txt and read for instuctions
[03:21] <Falstius> jamin06: cd into the diretory and type make -f makefile
[03:21] <sethk> jamin06, that isn't what you do first
[03:21] <rasman> david_, careful, you may be looking at your system drives.  But more than likely, ubuntu automatically mounted the drive.
[03:21] <jamin06> there it is
[03:21] <jamin06> oh
[03:21] <jamin06> im cd'd into the directory
[03:21] <luminousnerd> Pelo: There is both. but the readme said to ./configure
[03:21] <jamin06> im confused as to waht to type in and what order
[03:21] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  you can also check to make sure there isn'T a package for that app in synaptic , might be easier
[03:21] <rasman> david_, run 'df -h' to see what is mounted and how much space is left on the drives
[03:21] <beo> my media folder doesnt even show the camera at all and it is hooked up right, and the system does "see" it when its connected but the apps act like it isnt there
[03:21] <luminousnerd> should i run install?
[03:22] <sethk> jamin06, it being on (or not being on) a desktop is entirely irrelevant
[03:22] <jamin06> fine
[03:22] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  read the install
[03:22] <luminousnerd> Pelo: I doubt it, Ubuntu is all-Gnome all-the-time right?
[03:22] <david_> okay I am sure it is not the system drive.
[03:22] <david_> that is hda
[03:22] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  not necessaraly
[03:22] <kitche> jamin06: does it have a file in there that is called configure?
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as cwek-asmara
[03:22] <jamin06> configure.scan
[03:22] <david_> have ubuntu on a pata drive and the backup drive is sata... this is going to be a backup system for windows and linux server
[03:23] <luminousnerd> This is E17. I'm installing their libs so that I can run one of the apps that comes with E17 (the little mac-esque bar at the bottom has a non-widget version called Engage)
[03:23] <rasman> david_, you can run 'sudo umount /dev/hd<tab>' to unmount whatever drive
[03:23] <beo> highneko,  this is the error when running the app from terminal  "X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 169
[03:23] <beo> "
[03:23] <kitche> jamin06: no other configure files just plain configure

[03:23] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:23] <IrishDave> hey guys, I've run into a little problem trying to get ubuntu working on my laptop, the cd drive has stopped working, i have thought up a solution but need help with it.
[03:23] <rasman> david_, but you said it was sata so it would likely be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2
[03:23] <david_> Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
[03:23] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  are you sure you can'T find a linux version of that engage thing ? what does it do ?
[03:24] <david_> /dev/hda1             143G  2.0G  134G   2% /
[03:24] <luminousnerd> Pelo: answer was in INSTALL file
[03:24] <zumiez> Is it good to reinstall ATI Radion drivers after changing KERNELS??????
[03:24] <luminousnerd> if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh
[03:24] <jamin06> kitche: no
[03:24] <rasman> zumiez, are you using stock ubuntu kernels?
[03:24] <zumiez> yea
[03:24] <kitche> jamin06: I'll brbr class just got over
[03:24] <david_> /dev/sda1             154G  318M  154G   1% /media/sda1
[03:24] <Pelo> luminousnerd,   that's often where it is, in linux you need to learn to read
[03:24] <luminousnerd> Pelo: Engage IS for linux...it's an app running on E17 an alternative WM...
[03:24] <zumiez> im using stock generic kernel thinger that came with ubuntu
[03:24] <IrishDave> I'm thinking of writing the files to the hard disk using a usb connection (i have the drive case to allow this), that will then be bootable when inserted into the laptop
[03:24] <jamin06> k
[03:24] <IrishDave> i'm thinking of doing this from suse if anyone has any ideas?
[03:24] <luminousnerd> But it's not released yet, you have to get it through CVS
[03:25] <rasman> zumiez, then there is no need to reinstall ATI drivers
[03:25] <zumiez> rasman but my 3d is acting all funky
[03:25] <rasman> zumiez, run 'fglrxinfo' to see if the driver loaded correctly
[03:25] <luminousnerd> Running aclocal...
[03:25] <luminousnerd> ./autogen.sh: 8: aclocal: not found
[03:25] <IrishDave> what i dont know is what files to copy to the disk and how to set up the bootloader when not using the drive
[03:25] <rasman> david_, definately 'umount /dev/sda1' :)
[03:25] <rasman> david_, definately 'sudo umount /dev/sda1'
[03:26] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  sounds linke aclocal is a dependency,  look for it in synaptic
[03:26] <david_> qtparted shows /dev/sda1 ext3 active 153.38GB
[03:26] <Suavsilk_> can someone help me with an MPlaye r codecc problem
[03:26] <rasman> luminousnerd, you can do a quick search with 'aptitude search packagename'
[03:27] <rasman> david_, after unmounting it?
=== rc-1 is now known as test
[03:27] <rasman> Suavsilk_, what's up?
[03:27] <david_> no I am new and not fast. I am writing what qtparted is saying
[03:27] <david_> padon my slowness.
=== test is now known as beryl
[03:27] <Suavsilk_> rasman, i get an error when i try to play AVI's. i think i need to do something with win32.. or something
[03:28] <rasman> david_, you might want to close qtparted first and then umount the sda1 drive
=== beryl is now known as whyso
[03:28] <jamesbrink> is it possible to use firestarter with 2 network interfaces?
[03:28] <rasman> david_, don't worry... this stuff just takes time getting used to it
[03:28] <jamesbrink> it seems to block traffic to my 2nd interface
[03:28] <thevenin> jamesbrink: do you mean like 2 NIC's?
[03:28] <david_> okay I will try that... thanks a million I still have to learn mirc *LOL*
[03:29] <thevenin> it is a setting wrong somewhere
[03:29] <rasman> Suavsilk_, do you have the w32codecs installed?  'dpkg -l w32codecs'
[03:29] <david_> rasman thanks a bunch at least I have a starting point
[03:29] <knapp> anyone know of a program that'll let me edit WMA tags?
[03:29] <jamesbrink> thevenin: yes
[03:29] <Suavsilk_> rasman, i dont think so
[03:29] <rasman> david_, I'm learning xchat today
[03:29] <david_> 02 /dev/sda-1 free 7.84MB
[03:29] <luminousnerd> Pelo and rasman, Not found in synaptic
[03:29] <jamesbrink> thevenin: im trying to firewall just for my nic and wireless
[03:29] <rasman> Suavsilk_, what happens when you run 'sudo aptitude install w32codecs'
[03:29] <thevenin> well firestarter works with 2 NIC's, designed to be setup that way
[03:29] <thevenin> so i would check you settings
[03:30] <thevenin> your*
[03:30] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  google
[03:30] <david_> well that is what I am using right now. They did a good job with this version of ubuntu they seem to have solved the add and remove program system
[03:30] <voraistos> rasman: wont work w32codeds are not in any repo
[03:30] <rasman> Suavsilk_, you probably can't install it without adding a 'patent problem' repository
[03:30] <beo> "could not claim camera device while connected to USB device"
[03:30] <jamesbrink> it looks like it supports 2 interfaces for a trusted and untrusted
[03:30] <Suavsilk_> rasman, it does allot of stuff :/
[03:30] <jamesbrink> idk ill keep messing with it
[03:31] <david_> how does one send message to a specific person
[03:31] <Pelo> luminousnerd,  you can also try looking it up here http://www.linuxsoft.cz/en/
[03:31] <david_> I hate talking to you rasman in third party
[03:31] <Pelo> david_,  /msg  nick message
[03:31] <Suavsilk_> rasman, the error is: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device

[03:31] <skreet> I know with nano you can open multiple file buffers, how do you switch between them?
[03:32] <Pelo> beo,  try looking up your camera model in the forum, someone might have had your problem and left instructions
[03:32] <david_> Pelo not private public
[03:32] <|rt|> is there a place that stores the root mySQL password so that dpkg works properly to configure packages that need to install databases?
[03:32] <rasman> Suavsilk_, totally different problem, sorry.  run 'mplayer -vo help' to see what options are available for video output
[03:32] <bigfuzzyjesus> when i dont have a window manager open and try to open one using display command it gives me an error, i have more than 1 window manager though so is that a variable (xcfe, gnome, fluxbox)
[03:32] <FatherTyme> Is anyone else getting errors trying to install build-essential on dapper?

[03:32] <Pelo> david_,  just put the nick first then
[03:32] <beo> Pelo, thanks
[03:32] <bruenig> FatherTyme, what errors are you getting
[03:32] <voraistos> Suavsilk_ i suppose you are trying to run mplayer now. you have to go to configuration, and select a video output such as Xv. default is mostly non supported
[03:32] <david_> Suavsilk, thank you
[03:32] <FatherTyme> apt-get indicates that the package  has no installation candidate
[03:33] <david_> Pelo thank you
[03:33] <david_> rasman thanks a million
[03:33] <FatherTyme> Very weird.
[03:33] <skreet> thevenin: Thank you for pointing me to the man file, but it doesnt answer my questions
[03:33] <david_> Good bye to every one and thanks for all your help.
[03:33] <Suavsilk_> rasman, there are many options
[03:33] <thevenin> skreet: -f = multibuffer
[03:33] <rasman> |rt|, Yes /etc/mysql/debian.cnf  Read more about it in /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/README.Debian.gz using zless

[03:34] <Suavsilk_> voraistos, MPlayer dosnt apear to have toolbar options
[03:35] <Suavsilk_> voraistos, only the basic Play, Stop etc btns
[03:35] <voraistos> Suavsilk_ right or left click on the main window to see the menu
[03:35] <rasman> Suavsilk_, choose -vo xv for the best accelerated output.  if that doesn't work then use -vo x11
[03:35] <FatherTyme> yup. http://us.archive.ubuntu.com dapper-updates/main Sources
[03:35] <bigfuzzyjesus> rasman,  when i dont have a window manager open and try to open one using display command it gives me an error, i have more than 1 window manager though so is that a variable (xcfe, gnome, fluxbox)
[03:35] <rasman> bigfuzzyjesus, I'm trying to remember how to pick your window manager for gnome
[03:35] <luminousnerd> anyone here ever install automake?
[03:35] <|rt|> rasman: the file says do not touch....should I be worried about mucking around in there?
[03:36] <Suavsilk_> voraistos, got it thx
[03:36] <bruenig> FatherTyme, the line should say deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main
[03:36] <bigfuzzyjesus> rasman, xcfe is my main window manager
[03:36] <skreet> thevenin: I found it if you're curious, Meta-< and Meta->
[03:37] <rasman> |rt|, careful, I may have given you the wrong advice
[03:37] <jamesbrink> ok firestarter works
[03:37] <|rt|> rasman: well it looks like it may be along the right track....but the file has a warning at the top of it
[03:37] <jamesbrink> i just had to click that stupid thing for internet sharing
[03:37] <rasman> |rt|, that file contains the random password that debian-sys-maint uses to install packages
[03:37] <jamesbrink> thought that was for nat or somthing
[03:38] <|rt|> rasman: should there be a user in mysql to match debian-sys-maint?
[03:38] <rasman> bigfuzzyjesus, I think that xfce is the desktop environment.  Something like metacity is the window manager
[03:38] <thevenin> skreet: i dont know i will play with some options a little and if i get anything tell you
[03:38] <Suavsilk_> rasman, entering mplayer -vo xv, and mplayer -vo x11 in terminal returned errors/help list
[03:38] <rasman> |rt|, yes
[03:38] <skreet> thevenin: I found it if you're curious, Meta-< and Meta->
[03:38] <rasman> Suavsilk_, that brings me back to the idea that you don't have the correct windows codecs installed
[03:39] <Suavsilk_> rasman, how might i install these codecs?
[03:39] <thevenin> ok thank you, always good to learn something new

[03:41] <rasman> Suavsilk_, w32codecs check out http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy for more information
[03:41] <|rt|> bigfuzzyjesus: sorry can't help you there
[03:41] <Suavsilk_> rasman, will start reading up
[03:42] <skreet> haxality: All your media is in proprietary formats, ubuntu doesn't support out of the box
[03:42] <skreet> haxality: It's not really interesting :)
[03:42] <Suavsilk_> rasman, should i run this code?: sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-gl gstreamer0.10-plugins-base \

[03:42] <bruenig> Suavsilk_, remove the \
[03:42] <bruenig> or rather the \'s
[03:42] <skreet> Suavsilk_: don't remove the \'s
[03:43] <skreet> They indicate new lines in bash.
[03:43] <skreet> It's a multiline command.

[03:43] <Tosty> Buenas... alguien habla espaol?
[03:43] <bruenig> skreet, it is one command, the \ are put in there because where they were posted, they didn't want the command to force the page width to go way out
[03:44] <rasman> Suavsilk_, that will attempt to get totem codecs which is different and I don't think that you have the right repositories.  Ubuntu can't offer patent infringing packages
[03:44] <skreet> tosty: por espanol tu voy #ubuntu-es
[03:44] <skreet> Tosty:  and my spanish sucks :\
[03:44] <rasman> Suavsilk_, http://seveas.theplayboymansion.net/seveas/ has the repository list
[03:44] <Suavsilk_> rasman i see
[03:44] <rasman> gotta go
[03:44] <bigfuzzyjesus> can anyone help me

[03:45] <skreet> bigfuzzyjesus: How are you starting X?
[03:45] <foormea> hi
[03:45] <bruenig> !hi | foormea
[03:45] <ubotu> foormea: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:45] <skreet> bigfuzzyjesus: Consider installing a desktop manager, like xdm, gdm or kdm, it will maintain sessions for you.
[03:45] <scorp007> what package do i need to get manpages for the C standard library?
[03:45] <Suavsilk_> rasman, im runing the code i posted b4, at the end it does have win32codecs
[03:46] <skreet> scorp007: hang on a sec, i think i know that :P
[03:46] <scorp007> sure
[03:46] <bimberi> scorp007: manpages-dev
[03:46] <foormea> i just resized one of my ext3 partition, roughly from 40 to 70gb, thing is gparted kinda crashed ; i still have my data but free space is not accurate, it's just as if i was still having a 40gb partition (10gb free when 30gb used...). i already runned a e2fsck and it says no pb.
[03:46] <scorp007> bimberi: ah, thanks
[03:46] <bluefox83> is there a list of all the games available in the ubuntu repository?
[03:46] <skreet> bimberi: Just about to say that
[03:46] <skreet> heh
[03:47] <bimberi> scorp007: np :).  Sorry skreet
[03:48] <agent> how can i make one computer share a cd drive with another over ssh?
[03:48] <foormea> oh just found the -f option. i'll try that
[03:48] <haxality> ok, I got mp3 support working in xine and rhythmbox, but I'd really like to be able to use xmms and mplayer
[03:48] <bimberi> bluefox83: Syaptic has a "Games and Amusements" section.
[03:48] <bruenig> so does synaptic
[03:49] <skreet> bimberi: So does synaptic
[03:49] <skreet> oh man!
[03:49] <haxality> am I doing something hugely wrong?
[03:49] <skreet> owned again!
[03:49] <skreet> i think you can tell xmms/mplayer to use gstreamer libraries
[03:49] <bimberi> skreet: give up now :)
[03:49] <haxality> oh
[03:49] <haxality> heh
[03:49] <skreet> bimberi: I guess..
[03:49] <skreet> Im too busy to be quick
[03:49] <Falstius> haxality: why not just install xmms and mplayer then?
[03:49] <haxality> I did
[03:50] <bimberi> skreet: i'm off for a coffee anyway
[03:50] <haxality> they won't play mp3s or movie files
[03:50] <skreet> have fun :)
[03:50] <skreet> haxality: Kill them.
[03:50] <bimberi> skreet: cheers :)
[03:50] <haxality> uhh.. I don't think I should resort to violence so quickly
[03:50] <skreet> haxality: Violence never hurt anyone.
[03:50] <haxality> hahahaha
[03:50] <haxality> man, I really enjoy this channel sometimes
[03:51] <skreet> #ubuntu is where the party's at.
[03:51] <haxality> it's strange though, I think ubuntu actually managed to convert me to gnome
[03:51] <skreet> Or something.
[03:51] <Moon_Rabbits> Can someone tell me how I go about having two OS with the whole dual-booting jazz/
[03:51] <Moon_Rabbits> ?*
[03:51] <Pelo> well for a support only channel it can be pretty funky
[03:51] <skreet> haxality: I hear ya :(
[03:51] <haxality> I was such a hardcore fluxbox user
[03:51] <jrib> ubotu: tell Moon_Rabbits about dualboot
[03:51] <haxality> but like.. it just does such a good job integrating with gnome
[03:51] <Pelo> Moon_Rabbits,  install ubun and let grub handle it
[03:51] <haxality> maybe I'll just use xfce
[03:51] <haxality> that way I feel like it's gnome, but it doesn't lag my computer
[03:52] <skreet> haxality: the problem with all DEs for linux is the lack of integration, but ubuntu has done a good job.
[03:52] <foormea> hmm, just went through the e2fscd -f, still no improvement... do you have any idea?
[03:52] <haxality> I'm really impressed, to be honest
[03:52] <haxality> I'm about the most linux-cynical person on the face of the earth, too
[03:52] <bruenig> xfce is great
[03:52] <haxality> it took 4 installs to get ubuntu working on this laptop
[03:52] <bruenig> once you go xfce, you never go back
[03:52] <haxality> friggin trident video card
[03:52] <haxality> on that note, I'm gonna switch over to xfce and start configuring it
[03:53] <haxality> adieu, #ubuntu
[03:53] <Pelo> haxality,  have fun
[03:53] <Suavsilk_> rasman, skreet, bruenig, somehow during what i did i managed to get Totem Movie Player 2.16.2 to work perfectly... ive decided to uninstall MPlayer. thanks for your help
[03:53] <lightup> does anyone know what this means when I try and run alsamixer please?  It's got me stumped. "alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory"
[03:53] <skreet> Suavsilk_: Totem is good stuff :D
[03:53] <Suavsilk_> word ;) byebye
[03:54] <skreet> lightup: _ctl_open is to access the sound card.
[03:54] <lightup> ok
[03:54] <skreet> lightup: hold on a sec
[03:54] <lightup> could it be linked to the fact that sound files will only run if i open them with sudo?
[03:55] <skreet> lightup: Does that alsamixer problem go away when you sudo it?
[03:55] <Pelo> lightup,  if you can only run sound files as root something is definately wrong
[03:55] <lightup> ill try it
[03:55] <Jordan_U> How can I install fglrx without removing nvidia-glx ?
[03:55] <lightup> no same error as sudo
[03:56] <skreet> lightup: Just for kicks, make sure you're in the audio:x: line of /etc/group
[03:56] <lightup> its odd it only happens when I log in, ubuntu plays the login screen drum but then refuses to make sound after that, and I'm definitely in the audio group
[03:56] <lightup> I'll double check though, so I don't have to kick mytself later!
[03:56] <skreet> lightup: the sound made when you log in may well be as root, i think gdm is root.
[03:56] <matts03441> anyone use xine know what "driver" to use for best performance?
[03:56] <foormea> hey sorry guys, do you have any idea about that ext3 problem? i'm supposed to have like 40gb free but it says only 10gb free, e2fsck reports the partition as 'clean'
[03:56] <jack_> hi everyone, i have a problem with i810 driver for direct rendering
[03:57] <skreet> foormea: What does df -h report?
[03:57] <jack_> if i run something that uses direct rendering, sometimes, i get a crash of not just the program, but also of X
[03:57] <skreet> foormea: pastebin it if possible
[03:57] <jack_> how do i fix this?
[03:57] <Pelo> lightup,  check the user settings and make sure you have access to play sound files,  just for kicks
[03:57] <skreet> Pelo: That's the audio group, I think
[03:57] <lightup> audio:x:29:matt
[03:58] <Jordan_U> jack_: What is the output of: glxinfo | grep driver?
[03:58] <skreet> lightup: Has this ever worked, or a fresh install?
[03:58] <foormea> /dev/hda7              43G   30G   11G  74% /media/sauv          hummm yeah indeed 43gb, there's supposed to be like 70...
[03:58] <feanoris> hello! I'm using xchat and /me doesn't appear at all but only my nickname appears and nothing else. What should i do to repair it in order to see /me myself
[03:58] <feanoris> ?
[03:58] <lightup> its only been a problem since I changed from my onboard sound to an audigy2
[03:58] <Pelo> skreet,  I have something in there that says "use audio peripherals"  more or less I am translatingfrom frnch here
[03:58] <bruenig> feanoris, #xchat
[03:58] <yangsup> $ glxgears
[03:58] <yangsup> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x46
[03:59] <jack_> well, Jordan_U, it crashed on me and i'm currently ssh'd into te machine
[03:59] <jack_> the*
[03:59] <skreet> Pelo: Yes, I think that checking that box takes you out of audio group, etc.
[03:59] <yangsup> why?
[03:59] <jack_> so it says unable to open display...
[03:59] <Pelo> feanoris, what do you think /me does ? and are you putting a message afterwards
[03:59] <foormea> skreet should i try to re-resize it?
[04:00] <Jordan_U> jack_: Ok, I was just checking to make sure you were in fact using the correct driver, did you try to modprobe the module?
[04:00] <skreet> foormea: sudo cfdisk /dev/<device>
[04:00] <Crescendo_> I just installed a second video card, and connected a second monitor.  The screen won't display anything, though.  Now what?
[04:00] <skreet> foormea: Make sure it's partitioned right.
[04:00] <jack_> Jordan_U: yeah, intel_agp was properly modprobed, et al
[04:01] <Pelo> Crescendo, can you see your second card in the hardware manager ?
[04:01] <foormea> skreet :  hda7                    Logical   Linux ext3                       83149.36
[04:01] <jack_> i've looked online and there is a solution, but i don't know what to do with the module as it's not the same name as the module that i currently modprobe for (or X automagically modprobes for)
[04:01] <Jordan_U> How can I install fglrx without removing nvidia-glx ?
[04:01] <jack_> it's i810_drv or something instead of i810
[04:01] <skreet> foormea: Very odd.
[04:01] <Crescendo_> Pelo, device manager in administration?
[04:01] <Pelo> Crescendo,  yeah
[04:01] <skreet> foormea: check /etc/fstab to make sure it's being mounted right
[04:01] <foormea> yeap it is.
[04:02] <Crescendo_> Pelo, kinda.  I see nForce2 AGP with my primary card under it... and then a second one, with "(Different version?)" beside it.
[04:02] <skreet> foormea: Heres a curiosity question, and perhaps too much work for nil, but have you tried mounting it from a livecd?

[04:04] <Pelo> hello etzerd
[04:04] <skreet> I would gparted it from a livecd...
[04:04] <skreet> see if you can do it that way
[04:04] <npgmstr> I am a newbe to linux and am in need of intrest support
[04:04] <foormea> do you think it'd be hazardous to resize it to a new 'random' size then back to 70gb?
[04:04] <Crescendo_> Pelo, yes.
[04:04] <foormea> yeah gparted kinda crashed but my data is all here. odd. i'll restart and check what the livecd says?
[04:04] <RobNyc> anyone here has Enemy Territory True Combat ?
[04:04] <skreet> foormea: I would just resize it 1 mb smaller

[04:05] <foormea> rebooting wouldn't change anything? or would it?

[04:05] <npgmstr> ok. how do I under stand it better aside from playing with ubuntu?
[04:05] <Crescendo_> Anyone else have any ideas?
[04:05] <lightup> hmmm I'm still getting nowhere with this, I don't know if it means anything but programs like audacity and the jack daemon run fine, it's just general audio programs.  Could it be a gstreamer thing?  I'm clutching at straws here it's had me stuck for days
[04:06] <jack_> so any ideas guys?
[04:06] <jack_> this is really annoying that i have a system that operates just like windows because of a lame driver
[04:06] <Pelo> Crescendo,  I mean searching the forum for something already there,  such as dual monitor , or dual video card

[04:06] <npgmstr> thus far I love it. but I am kinda shying on putting it on  the main pc I use.
[04:07] <Crescendo_> I love how googling "dual video card" returns the first few results from ubuntuforums

[04:07] <npgmstr> yeah big time. toyed with the ida for a few months. and got a machine that I slapped together and loded it in to try out

[04:09] <npgmstr> lol well I am almost ready to say bye to microsoft.
[04:09] <Pelo> shawarma,  use the plugin manager in ff

[04:09] <itrebal> any ideas how to fix this error:  pastebin.ca/250601 it came up after I did a dist-updrade
[04:09] <crimsun> jack_: (note that Debian's adduser does accept adding a user to a group)
[04:09] <jack_> <insert bad things to say about debian here>
[04:09] <shingalated> does anyone know why frostwire/limewire isn't working in edgy with beryl?
[04:10] <zambonie_> ms has got one thing going for it, integration, and they may have waited too long with the next gen stuff.  we'll see.
[04:10] <jack_> if gentoo's emerge and debian's apt combined forces - that would be a *real* distribution
[04:10] <foormea> just a question, would partition magic be able to resize or repair e2fs ?

[04:10] <Xenguy> npgmstr: there is no best version =)
[04:10] <jack_> draeath: it's not the lack of source i'm whining about, it's how the source is organized

[04:11] <itrebal> npgmstr: you'll learn that that is a very dangerous question, and you just have to find the one that fits you

[04:12] <rikai> oh, sorry, isinterpreted, its bright blue text. :/
[04:12] <draeath> crimsun, if your '/' filesystem is on a device that will shut off with power failure, and the rest of the system has a battery... would having the journal internal to the battery device be any use?
[04:12] <Pelo> shawn__,  use the plugin manager in ff
[04:13] <itrebal> anyone know how to resolve this error: pastebin.ca/250601
[04:13] <crimsun> draeath: possibly
[04:13] <shingalated> formea, yes partition magic should let you resize a ext2 partition
[04:13] <rikai> Pelo,  txt?
[04:13] <npgmstr> I guess I want both. kinda like windows but not as stressfull to run.
[04:13] <Jimbo> Anyone look at that pastebin?
[04:13] <rikai> Xenguy, does bright blue text mean anything important? ;)
[04:13] <foormea> thanks shingalated
[04:13] <Pelo> rikai,  forget it
[04:13] <shawn__> sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-vlc ?
[04:13] <draeath> crimsun, ok. and the resizing would be handy too, as its a 100gb partition on an otherwise empty 320gb drive. I may expand
[04:13] <crimsun> shawn__: don't, it's broken in edgy.
[04:13] <itrebal> npgmstr: Suse is really graphicy and decently fast
[04:13] <draeath> crimsun, already got it set up, even mounting with UUID
[04:13] <Staz> If I have a volume group made up of 4 hdds, have one big ext3 partition on there, if 1 hdd dies have I just lost the data on that one hdd, or everything?
[04:14] <itrebal> npgmstr: and it will hold your hand every step of the way
[04:14] <Pelo> shawn__,  try looking in synaptic
[04:14] <shawn__> crimsum;: thanks...any idea when it would be up for edgy?
[04:14] <draeath> npgmstr but the default package system in suse is horribly slow. but its easy enough to get the apt (debian/ubuntu) system to work.
[04:14] <Jimbo> I have been trying to install "pan0.119 beta", a newsreader that supports nzb files ( http://pan.rebelbase.com/download/ ) with no success> I pasted what I did in pastebin and Im wondering if someone can shed some light on this and point out my mistake if there is one. pastebin:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32219/
[04:14] <crimsun> shawn__: it's not fixable in edgy due to the number of changes required [and edgy's frozen because it's released] 
[04:14] <Jimbo> new to linux here
[04:14] <foormea> okay anyway i'm resizing to 1mb lower than previous, with gparted, hasn't crashed yet :D
[04:15] <npgmstr> ok so far I am sticking to ubuntu.
[04:15] <crimsun> shawn__: I'll address it in feisty; perhaps a backport to edgy-backports will be made. Depends when the fix is available.
[04:15] <npgmstr> as I said thus far I like it.
[04:15] <shawn__> crimsun: cool beans
[04:16] <npgmstr> I think the whole change thing is a little scary at first.being windows based for so many years.

[04:19] <npgmstr> will ubuntu work on my newer system? I was a little comcered if my video card will operate well with it.

[04:22] <crimsun> cirvin_fox: what's the issue?
[04:22] <jrib> Jimbo: you have to read the output of "./configure" before continuing to "make".  You need build-essential installed and you probably want to do 'sudo apt-get build-dep pan' as well
[04:22] <bimberi> Jimbo: install build-essential
[04:22] <Stegozor> yup, you can get a .deb package of pan from http://pan.rebelbase.com
[04:22] <lightup> shingalated, type java -version, you need 1.5+

[04:23] <itrebal> fuck it, I'll just reinstall ubuntu..
[04:23] <cirvin_fox> whenever i install my tv tuner card, my sound system doesnt work

[04:24] <crimsun> cirvin_fox: (tell me the output)
[04:24] <Jimbo> Then do same as i did before right?
[04:24] <bimberi> Jimbo: you just need the compilation tools (build-essential)
[04:24] <bimberi> Jimbo: yes
[04:24] <Jimbo> ok
[04:24] <Jimbo> gonna try..bbl
[04:24] <bimberi> Jimbo: when you reach the 'make install' step you should consider using checkinstall ...
[04:24] <bimberi> !checkinstall | Jimbo
[04:24] <cirvin_fox> name of avalible cards: I82801DBICH4
[04:24] <ubotu> Jimbo: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages.

[04:29] <lightup> shingalated, that might be an idea, frostwire (while being the open source version which makes it cooler) does tend to have more problems

[04:31] <shingalated> I have used gtk-gnutella, but I like limewire, because it lets you download to different diretories automagically by filetype
[04:31] <dcraven> antmanuv, you could try epiphany.
[04:31] <antmanuv> cool
[04:31] <antmanuv> thanks <dcraven>

[04:33] <tonquin> and im not sure which wireless host i'm connected to.
[04:33] <crimsun> cirvin_fox: bttv takes over /dev/dsp from your snd_intel8x0's snd_pcm_oss (alsa's oss emulation)
[04:33] <Zambezi> I got a problem. It seems my eth0 didn't work properly, so I changed the networkcard to another. I put in a 3Com. But Dapper server still "looking" for the other interface. How can I change this. I have the MAC-adress on the other interface.
[04:33] <antmanuv> dcraven epiphany need firefox and i actualy hate firefox

[04:34] <ademan_> ubuntu is offering me updates for something, and i'm not sure if the updates are because of a new third party repository i just added, is there a way to see which repository the updates are from in the update manager? (or any other way really)
[04:34] <dcraven> antmanuv, try lynx.
[04:34] <cirvin_fox> crimsun, so is there a way to get it back?
[04:34] <antmanuv> dcraven hum!! cool thanks again
[04:34] <crimsun> cirvin_fox: sure, unload bttv and snd_pcm_oss, then reload snd_pcm_oss only
[04:35] <jrib> antmanuv: kazehakase and links2 possibly as well

[04:52] <akk> crimsun: So if I need to add a script so that my cardbus network card gets ifup'ed, where would I put it?
[04:52] <crimsun> akk: use interfaces(5)
[04:52] <LjL> anyway, this is not the freenode help channel. join #freenode please, or at least go to -offtopic, if what you need isn't Ubuntu support, Clin11
[04:52] <lightup> shingalated, if it's not throwing out an error message it could be anything.  Only thing I could suggest would be reinstalling either beryl or limewire.  Which did you install first?  If you installed LW first you could try reinstalling it now beryl is in charge of your windows
[04:52] <shingalated> lightup, actually I lied, I guess some other people are having the same problem
[04:53] <crimsun> akk: specifically, you need a pre hook.
[04:53] <Jimbo> Bimberi: i installed checkinstall and auto-apt...do I need to use> auto-apt run ./configure instead of ./configure?
[04:53] <shingalated> yeah it works if im in metacity
[04:53] <bimberi> Jimbo: i'm not familiar with auto-apt sorry
[04:53] <cafuego> Jimbo: Yes, you do.
[04:53] <Jimbo> k
[04:53] <LjL> Jimbo: yes, if you want to use auto-apt to help configuring. but then auto-apt will ask a lot of questions about packages to install, many of which you should answer NO to
[04:54] <LjL> Jimbo: perhaps it would be better if you just went through the configure normally and used auto-apt or apt-file as a help when you're stuck
[04:54] <Jimbo> do i have to use auto apt since i installed it?
[04:54] <shawn__> bluefox: just installed the mplayer and the mozilla plugin, no dice
[04:54] <cafuego> Jimbo: No, best is you use a precompiled package. <heh>
[04:54] <shawn__> bluefox83: just installed the mplayer and the mozilla plugin, no dice
[04:54] <Jimbo> i dont have a precompiled package
[04:55] <bluefox83> shawn__, what kind of movie is it?
[04:55] <bluefox83> shawn__, extension?
[04:55] <Jimbo> brb,,,gonna try again
[04:55] <akk> crimsun: A pre hook like pre-up? The problem is that it's never set as "up" ...
[04:55] <shawn__> eh, prob wmv but those play fine in vlc if I d/l and then open
[04:55] <crimsun> akk: even with an auto line?
[04:55] <jts> shawn__:  I followed your link, it looks like those drivers are for an ATI card? I'm on onboard video?
[04:55] <cafuego> akk: a cardbus card is set as up by cardmgr when inserted.
[04:56] <costalivan> Hello
[04:56] <costalivan> I'm using ubuntu 6.10
[04:56] <cuddlebug> guys i need some help, i burned the alternate ubuntu installer but it seems to be the same as the live cd, anyway im trying to manually edit the partition table i resized it so i had 2 gigs and 5 mb, it says i need to make a swap partition of 500 mb, is this a primary or extended partition? and what file system?
[04:56] <akk> Oh, hey, that time "auto" did it. It never did in breezy or dapper.
[04:56] <costalivan> but I have a problem with kismet
[04:56] <cuddlebug> 500 mb*
[04:57] <costalivan> somebody has kismet working ?
[04:57] <akk> cafuego: Is that new? cardmgr used to only handle pcmcia, and cardbus cards used hotplug instead.
[04:57] <shawn__> jts: not sure then, consult your mobo manf website...
[04:57] <costalivan> my interface is ath0
[04:57] <cafuego> akk: Hmm...
[04:57] <akk> (that would be great -- cardmgr always worked really well for pcmcia)
[04:57] <jts> cuddlebug: its a 'linux-swap" partition. my understanding is its like window's pagefile
[04:57] <cuddlebug> so is that extended or primary
[04:57] <Jimbo> ok...whats wrong with this  sudo auto-apt get install libpcre3-dev
[04:57] <cafuego> akk: maybe cardmgr hands off to hotplug; mine certainly makes  alog entry if a card is plugged in.
[04:57] <jts> shawn__:  alrighty. thankjs
[04:58] <lightup> shingalated, given that it seems your best bet would be to switch to metacity while using limewire seeing as you can choose it from the beryl tray icon menu.  It's a bit of an inconvenience though, maybe you could try using gtk-gnutella (in the repositories) instead.  Also make sure you file a bug to the beryl team, it could be a java incompatibiliy they'd want to know about
[04:58] <LjL> jts: same purpose, yes, but it's a partition and not a file. linux can use a file as well, though that's not generally done
[04:58] <cafuego> akk: All I need is an entry in interfaces here for th card and it gets run when I insert it
[04:58] <akk> cafuego: Maybe this is new, because with "auto" in interfaces, the card does seem to get configured, and definitely didn't before edgy.
[04:58] <Jimbo> LjL  whats wrong with this   sudo auto-apt get install libpcre3-dev

[05:08] <Q_Continuum> What's the easy way to change boot/console resolution to a 16:9 (widescreen) resolution of 1280x800?  (Documentation I've found is for "normal" resolutions)
[05:09] <Jimbo> Now it says something about could not run Glib test program. heres the pastebin   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32256/
[05:09] <Jimbo> Im getting frustrated
[05:09] <cafuego> Q_Continuum: I don't think vgafb (which is what's used) supports widescreen. At all.

[05:10] <cafuego> Which is?

[05:10] <Jimbo> do i need to install or re install something called glib...whatever that is

[05:11] <Toma-> Jimbo: is pan in the ubuntu repos?
[05:11] <sizzam> Jimbo: are you using Pan for NZB files, or just regular news reading
[05:11] <Jimbo> no...not this version

[05:12] <sizzam> Jimbo: have you heard of 'hellanzb' yet?
[05:12] <Toma-> ANY version
[05:12] <Jimbo> this is the only version that runs nzb
[05:13] <Jimbo> Toma-: will sudo apt-get build-dep pan get me the beta?
[05:13] <Toma-> not the beta, the stuff needed to build the beta
[05:13] <Toma-> then you run your ./configure/make/checkinstall
[05:13] <Jimbo> i downloaded the beta already
[05:13] <dbanger> I was wondering if someone could assist me with some grub difficulties in the desktop installer
[05:13] <sizzam> Jimbo: check this out when you get a chance, this is what i use for nzb and i love it --- http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=169749
[05:14] <Toma-> Jimbo: if you do compile anything, swap the command 'make install' with checkinstall... yourll have to install checkinstall, but its well worth the effort
=== ReYnoLd_ubaya is now known as cwek
[05:14] <Jimbo> i already installed checkinstall but i got another error...see pastebin?

[05:17] <toddobryan> Any ideas?
[05:17] <sizzam> Jimbo: now I use hella, its all terminal based.  its a daemon thats always running.  as soon as you drop an NZB into a specified folder it picks it up and goes to work
[05:18] <Jojay> toddobryan: rescan your collection
[05:18] <Jojay> check your codecs
[05:18] <Jimbo> k
[05:18] <toddobryan> Did the first.
[05:18] <toddobryan> How do I check the codecs?
[05:18] <Pelo> toddobryan,  try uninstalling  rythmbox and reinstalling it
[05:18] <Jimbo> Toma so build dep is what i need..brb
[05:19] <dbanger> is anyone here able to help me with a grub issue on 6.10 desktop install?
[05:19] <Toma-> Jimbo: thats 'sudo apt-get build-dep packagename'
[05:20] <Pelo> dbanger,  what is the issue ?
[05:20] <Jimbo> Toma-: so would it be  sudo apt-get build-dep pan-o.119   ?
[05:20] <SAS_Spidey01> excuse me but what is the standard file system for Ubuntu 6.06 ?
[05:20] <dbanger> I have three ide controller, one onboard, and two PCI
[05:20] <AWOSLappy> SAS_Spidey01 -- ext3

[05:21] <dbanger> install of grub fails with an unknown error when installing to hd0
[05:21] <Jimbo> brb
[05:21] <Toma-> Jimbo: no, 'sudo apt-get build-dep pan'
[05:21] <Pelo> dbanger,  how are you installing grub ?
[05:22] <Jimbo> toma-: wont that get the same package thats in the synaptic?
[05:22] <dbanger> Pelo, default via the desktop installer
[05:22] <AWOSLappy> My Synaptics TouchPad has suddently stopped working after reboot.  I am using Dapper Drake 6.06.1 LTS with X.org 1.0.2-0ubuntu10.4
[05:22] <Toma-> Jimbo: no, itll get the packages that the build needs to make pan
[05:22] <Pelo> dbanger,  you mean synaptic ?
[05:22] <dbanger> no, I mean this is a clean install from the live-cd
[05:23] <dbanger> sorry for the confusion
[05:23] <Pelo> dbanger,  does  ubuntu install ?
[05:23] <dbanger> yes, but it fails when installing grub
[05:23] <Jimbo> Toma-: im a bit confused but should I just run sudo apt-get build-dep pan and see what I get?
[05:23] <dbanger> all the files and filesystems are present
[05:23] <Pelo> dbanger,  try installing grub from synaptic
[05:24] <dbanger> ok
[05:24] <Toma-> Jimbo: run 'sudo apt-get build-dep pan' THEN try building pan again from the beta you got (eg. ./configure && make && checkinstall)
[05:24] <dbanger> from within the livecd?
[05:24] <Jimbo> ok
[05:24] <AWOSLappy> Also Ubuntu now hangs on bootup for a couple of minutes with the error '/sbin/modprobe': Unexpected exit (or something similar to that, I can't remember exactly -- too busy trying to fix mouse)
[05:24] <Pelo> dbanger,  no from the repos
[05:24] <Pelo> dbanger,  did you install ubuntu on your hdd ?
[05:25] <variant> ffs
[05:25] <AWOSLappy> Also I can't mount my NFS partitions; it comes up "mount to NFS server failed."
[05:25] <variant> firefox suddently stopped working for me
[05:25] <dbanger> Pelo, I installed ubuntu to my hdd from the livecd.  I cannot reboot, though, because grub failed to install.
[05:25] <AWOSLappy> !language | variant
[05:25] <ubotu> variant: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[05:25] <dbanger> there is no bootloader on my system currently

[05:26] <variant> AWOSLappy: what is that supposed to mean?
[05:26] <AWOSLappy> variant, ffs?  that's not exactly my idea of "family friendly".
[05:26] <shawn__> ok, mplayer won't play wmv but vlc does, how so?

[05:26] <variant> then it just exits
[05:26] <Pelo> dbanger, is ubuntu the only os on that  hdd ?
[05:26] <variant> i tried without hte .mozilla direectory but same thing
[05:27] <dbanger> yes, but it is installed on hdi, since that is the order that my drives were detected.
[05:27] <variant> shawn__: vlc uses some codecs built in, you need w32codecs to get mplayer to play them
[05:27] <specialbuddy> how do I  set a fixed mount point for USB Hard Drives?
[05:28] <variant> specialbuddy: with a udev rule

[05:28] <variant> specialbuddy: for example, i have a usb key made by kingston. when i plug that exact key in and only that one it is created as /media/kingston
[05:28] <Pelo> dbanger,  try this ( no garanties),   , turn off computer,  unplug the other hdds ( leave only the ubuntu hdd plugged in ) ,  start comp, which should boot up ubuntu,  install grub from within ubuntu using synpatic,  turn off computer, plugg the other hdd backup ,  see what happens

[05:29] <specialbuddy> variant, how would I figure out how to do this?
[05:29] <variant> specialbuddy: hold on a sec
[05:29] <dbanger> pelo, ubuntu won't boot at all since grub does not install
[05:29] <dbanger> pelo, rather, grub is installed, but it cannot install itself as the bootloader
[05:30] <Pelo> dbanger,  not even if it is the only os present on the computer ?
[05:30] <tgelter> hey guys, I get an error that says I have to compile gtkpod together with the mp4v2 library...assuming I have the gtkpod source and it's been configured, how do I compile in this way?

[05:30] <dbanger> pelo, no os detected error occurred the last time I tried that.
[05:31] <highneko> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyiacxtIzYk
[05:31] <AWOSLappy> dbanger, I'll do a variant of what Pelo said:

[05:32] <Pelo> intersting approach
[05:32] <dbanger> Pelo/AWOSLappy thanks.  I'll give that a shot.
[05:32] <variant> specialbuddy: i dont remember off hte top of my head and i cant check for you untill i fix this firefox program im having

[05:44] <variant> AWOSLappy: that works over ssh as well :) thats how i use irc
[05:44] <Cyrano_De> This will get you into an vi stile history mode.  You can then use vi commands to select and copy text from that buffer.
[05:44] <gary_> Jimbo..yes that exactly
[05:45] <gary_> Jimbo, if it shows that theres no such package, someone also mentioned libgmime2.0-dev

[05:46] <AWOSLappy> variant yep
[05:46] <Pelo> jokoon,  try looking it up in the forum
[05:46] <crimsun> jokoon: snd-emu10k1 and snd-ca0106 are the appropriate drivers, depending on the sub{vendor,device} ids
[05:46] <Jimbo> too much work for a freakin beta newsreader install but its getting personal now...:)
[05:46] <crimsun> jokoon: what's the issue?
[05:46] <AWOSLappy> variant, now um, how to copy?
[05:46] <variant> AWOSLappy: copy what?
[05:46] <variant> AWOSLappy: copy paste?
[05:46] <AWOSLappy> variant yes
[05:46] <AWOSLappy> I need to copy part of my dmesg output for my bcm43xx problem
[05:46] <Cyrano_De> screen is a godsend when you need to run an app on a server and leave it running and take your laptop home.
[05:46] <AWOSLappy> it is crashing modprobe
[05:46] <jokoon> crimsun : rising the bass and treble saturates the sound
[05:47] <gary_> Jimbo, looks like lakecaj had it right...libgmime1-dev
[05:47] <AWOSLappy> Cyrano_De yeah it looks COOOOOOOOOOL.  :)
[05:47] <DanaG> I usually leave tone control off.
[05:47] <DanaG> 50% is neutral, I believe.
[05:47] <jokoon> I tried alsamixer but it is quite the same than the integrated UI

[05:47] <variant> AWOSLappy: what do you mean? why dont you copy/paste it to pastebin site?
[05:47] <AWOSLappy> jokoon, does this happen in Windows too?  and what sound board?
[05:47] <Cyrano_De> AWOSLappy: Here is a good intro that will help with copy/paste   http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Using_screen
[05:47] <AWOSLappy> variant, I don't know how to get screen in to copy mode
[05:47] <Poseidon> is there anyway to realize 3d desktop? where can i get the reference?
[05:48] <AWOSLappy> Cyrano_De thanks
[05:48] <jokoon> AWOSLappy : no
[05:48] <Pelo> jokoon,  in alsamixer if you use the arrows to go all the way to the right and pass that you get more options
[05:48] <DanaG> Poseidon: google 'edgy beryl'

[05:48] <ksmurf> that is awesome
[05:48] <Cyrano_De> How do I start/control xscreensaver in Edgy Eft?  I cannot find the xscreensaver executable nor xscreensaver-command
[05:48] <jokoon> Pelo yes but this is quite the same

[05:49] <DanaG> er

[05:51] <Jimbo> gary: i ran em both. first one couldnt find it, second one (sudo apt-get install libgmime1-dev) found and appeared to install something but when I ran ./configure , I got the same error
[05:51] <Pelo> squidly,  I meant uninstall the new one
[05:51] <crimsun> jokoon: yes, and how much are the deltas?
[05:51] <Pelo> sorry
[05:51] <DanaG> I can't stand usplash -- I want fbsplash!
[05:51] <squidly> Pelo: umm.. how can that help me out? the install kernel does not work with my video cards
[05:51] <crimsun> DanaG: you're free to modify it as you please
[05:51] <jokoon> crimsun where are these ?
[05:52] <DanaG> I tried.
[05:52] <DanaG> I end up with messages overwriting the silent splash.
[05:52] <crimsun> jokoon: the deltas are by how much you're changing them
[05:52] <Pelo> DanaG,  compile it manualy
[05:52] <DanaG> I mean, I have the kernel support.
[05:52] <Cyrano_De> DanaG: the xscreensaver commands do not seem to even be available in the Edgy Eft repositories.  I do not have an executable and apt-cache search gives me no more than I already have installed.
[05:52] <jokoon> crimsun I push them to the max, 100
[05:52] <DanaG> Right now I have usplash for boot, and fbsplash for console background/
[05:52] <crimsun> jokoon: have you tried smaller deltas for each?
[05:52] <DanaG> Cyrano_De: you may need to enable some other repos
[05:52] <jokoon> but anyway I don't have the quality I have with windows
[05:53] <DanaG> In synaptic.
[05:53] <jokoon> crimsun no
[05:53] <variant> anyone know how to start firefox in safe mode?
[05:53] <jokoon> I keep to think it should be some driver issue
[05:53] <DanaG> I think somehow Winamp > Xine > Gstreamer, quality-wise.
[05:53] <Pelo> squidly,  you didnt, mention that, I can'T help you then, it's over my head
[05:53] <crimsun> jokoon: I can't conclude that until you find what delta size triggers the symptom

[05:55] <DanaG> Automatix is evil in some cases.  At least use their repos but not their script.
[05:55] <Pelo> squidly,  if no one here can help try looking up your usb drive model number in the forum for a solution
[05:55] <Jimbo> why cant I compile this freakin thing? heres another pastebin   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32261/
[05:55] <squidly> Pelo: umm.. its a USB keyboard and mouse
[05:55] <crimsun> DanaG: GSt can't possibly fit there. It's a plugin-based framework, not a codec.
[05:55] <variant> i moved /usr/lib to annohter parititon and symlinked it to /usr/lib but this seems to have cause firefox to stop working. anyonw konw why?
[05:56] <DanaG> Well, whatever.  It may be the audio drivers, actually.
[05:56] <jokoon> crimsun : I lowered the wave entry and it seems much more fine now
[05:56] <Jimbo> getting late..ill try it again tommorrow
[05:56] <DanaG> Either that, or I'm just imagining the difference.

[05:56] <dark_light> About automatix: I think Ubuntu got from Debian the nicest thing it has: the package system. It should be used
[05:56] <Zambezi> Is it necassary to install a packages to run ./configure?
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> squidly: if your usb drive has a volume label on it, just use the LABEL= style entry in fstab, that way if it changes device numbers it will always just mount when found by the LABEL
[05:56] <crimsun> DanaG: case in point: there are at least two different mpeg 1 layer 3 codecs for GSt
[05:56] <Pelo> squidly,  system > prefts > removable disk and media
[05:56] <crimsun> jokoon: good, that's a known issue and is hardware-based, not driver-based.

[05:57] <Pelo> squidly,  sorry never mind that last one, but you can still look your problem up in the forum
[05:57] <Jordan_U> Zambezi: Yes, but what are you trying to install, chances are you don't need to compile from source.
[05:57] <jokoon> remember to suggest to lower PCM and Wave too
[05:57] <DanaG> And don't use Tone controls.
[05:57] <crimsun> jokoon: I already set those to 80% in the initscript; if they were higher, they're user-specific. I can't control what users do.
[05:57] <DanaG> Some controls are gain rather than attenuation.
[05:57] <Zambezi> Jordan_U, I do need to install from sources. There's no packages in apt-get.
[05:58] <variant> Jordan_U: no it does not
[05:58] <variant> Jordan_U: i notice that the real firefox binary is located in /usr/lib/ so i am assuming my move of the dir has stopped it working. dont see why a symlink shouldnt work just as well though
[05:58] <sizzam> Jewfro-Macabbi: apparently you can convert with ffmpeg, have you tried that yet?
[05:58] <Jordan_U> Zambezi: What program are you trying to install, you will need to get the build dependencies for it.
[05:58] <Jordan_U> ?

[05:59] <variant> squidly: so why do you want to name them specifically?
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> squidly: you said 'usb mount'
[05:59] <crimsun> jokoon: they are limited by default.
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> squidly: that is why all of us have been saying fs related things
[06:00] <variant> squidly: yeah, get your facts right and dont shout at us, we are just trying to help you
[06:00] <Pelo> squidly,  go to the forum and search for  usb mouse edgy and usb keyboard edgy
[06:00] <jokoon> I mean limited at 80%
[06:00] <DanaG> squidly: you can use evdev by Option "Name" in xorg.conf
[06:00] <squidly> variant: ok I've said like 10 times that is a use keyboard mouse.
[06:00] <DanaG> heck, I'll post my xorg.conf
[06:00] <carl> does anyone know which version of ubuntu 6.06 I should download for a mac book pro with an intel chip?  i386 or  power pc  version?
[06:00] <squidly> DanaG: its not an issue in the xconfig.. its kernel issue.. it does not start the usb system with the new kernel
[06:01] <variant> squidly: not directly to me you havent, like i am supposed to watch for everything you say in this channel when im talking to like 5 other people at the same tim
[06:01] <crimsun> jokoon: no, because some revisions of the stac76xx codec aren't audible unless those elements are set above the non-normalised 70%
[06:01] <DanaG> That's odd.
[06:01] <rickyfingers> carl: i386

[06:01] <jokoon> sound obvious
[06:01] <DanaG> What's this about Sigmatel?
[06:01] <variant> squidly: well done
[06:01] <DanaG> I have issues with my sigmatel.
[06:01] <crimsun> jokoon: again, it's a hardware issue, not a driver one. We would have resolved this years ago in the driver if it were that simple.
[06:01] <Pelo> g'night folks
[06:01] <Jordan_U> Zambezi: Sorry, that package name is build-essential

[06:02] <carl> rickyfingers  thanks
[06:02] <jokoon> crimsun I don't deny that, at least on ubuntu, good drivers are installed by default, not like windows.
[06:02] <variant> squidly: fine, you didnt tell me that you were talking about a keyboard/mouse. explain what you want to acheive and i will help you
[06:03] <DanaG> I had to make a script to repeatedly remove and re-modprobe snd-hda-intel to get it to work.
[06:03] <squidly> variant: sorry.. I just installed 6.0.6 via the alternate cd (for Raid)
[06:03] <crimsun> DanaG: which codec do you have/
[06:03] <DanaG> STAC9250
[06:03] <squidly> variant: i updated my kenrel and now when I boot I can use my usb mouse our keyboard
[06:03] <DanaG> (notebook is Gateway M685)
[06:03] <crimsun> DanaG: are you tracking alsa-driver hg? If not, you need to.
[06:03] <function1> so, is it true i can only get the /dev/sequencer if i have an audigy or sb live or some such card?
[06:03] <variant> squidly: you can use them?
[06:03] <DanaG> tracking?
[06:04] <crimsun> function1: utterly false. modprobe snd-seq.
[06:04] <squidly> variant: is there any known issues with the 2.6.15-27-386 kernel
[06:04] <variant> squidly: i take it you mean can't
[06:04] <crimsun> function1: then use timidity
[06:04] <DanaG> Oh, and there's no input on that or on my cardbus Audigy.
[06:04] <jokoon> crimsun other thing : I searched emu10k1 in the synaptic manager, it is normal that snd-emu10k1 is not there ?
[06:04] <squidly> variant: correct with the 15-26 kernel I can use them.. that is what I'm using now
[06:04] <variant> squidly: not that i know of. what does dmesg say when you plug/unplug one of the devices
[06:04] <function1> crimsun: i've got the device, but nothing (ie no midis) will play. i modprobed that mod too
[06:04] <crimsun> DanaG: tracking means following development in the sense of compiling daily snapshots
[06:04] <DanaG> aah.
[06:04] <DanaG> I updated my kernel tree with the 1.0.13 ALSA
[06:04] <crimsun> function1: did you invoke ``timidity -iA'' (after installing timidity)?
[06:05] <DanaG> Is there any easy way to update it while not breaking the packaged-ness of ALSA?
[06:05] <Jordan_U> Zambezi: Since rtorrent is in the repositories you can probably get all the build dependencies by running: sudo apt-get build-dep rtorrent But the dependencies may be a little different for the newest version.
[06:05] <aztracker1> quick question, if anyone knows.. is there a tutorial on how to switch to an SMP kernel?  I'm using a p4HT, I have the HT dissabled, not sure if it's better off that way in nix or not?
[06:05] <squidly> variant: variant I dont know I cant even get to my dmesg
[06:05] <jokoon> ah sorry, seems fine
[06:05] <function1> crimsun: oh yea i followed some ubuntu community doc called MidiSoftwareSynthesiswithTimidity or some such, dont think it worked, but let me try again
[06:05] <variant> aztracker1: edgy uses smp enabled kernel by default. dapper you have to install it with apt-get
[06:05] <crimsun> DanaG: you're only concerned about alsa-driver; just overwrite what the kernel provides. Use ``make install-modules'' instead of ``make install''
[06:06] <aztracker1> okay, am in edgy, should probably turn HT back on in the next reboot.
[06:06] <variant> squidly: i see, set ssh to start automatically and use a different system to check dmesg
[06:06] <variant> squidly: if you can
[06:06] <aztracker1> variant, thx
[06:06] <squidly> variant: no joy there :( no other working comptuer
[06:06] <Zambezi> Jordan_U, I'll give it a shot. I'll check on the homepage. The compilation goes alot better now. Thanks.
[06:06] <function1> crimsun: ohhhh so timidity isnt a replacement for the hardware seq?
[06:06] <squidly> variant: if I had a laptop I would have done that.. ssh is what I use to admin remote servers
[06:06] <DanaG> Development release ---
[06:06] <crimsun> function1: it's software.
[06:06] <variant> squidly: so when you boot that kernel your mouse/kb dont work at all? is this a custom compiled kernel as it sounds more like usb hid is not compiled into the kernel
[06:07] <DanaG> just --- -- no version
[06:07] <squidly> variant: is the kernel in aptitude
[06:07] <Jordan_U> Zambezi: But remember, it is always safer to use the version from Ubuntu's repositories.
[06:07] <variant> squidly: what?
[06:07] <variant> squidly: it is the kernel in apt you mean?
[06:07] <function1> crimsun: yea, but you still need to modprove snd-seq to use timidity? i mean i did modprobe, i am just curious
[06:07] <squidly> variant: yea I went in to aptitue (the ncurses apt gui) and did an update
[06:07] <crimsun> function1: through edgy, yes. I committed the fix for feisty last week.
[06:08] <Zambezi> Jordan_U, It doesn't work properly.
[06:08] <jmx> anyone wanna help me install a flash player?

[06:09] <DanaG> I just wish there were a choice between usplash and fbsplash.
[06:10] <squidly> variant: yea and I messed up the grub install and it over wrote the windows mbr I had too.
[06:10] <DanaG> The one thing I do have to give usplash credit for is the presence of fake-widescreen themes.
[06:10] <variant> squidly: why do you need windows mbr?
[06:10] <variant> squidly: setup grub to boot windows

[06:10] <Jordan_U> jmx: Do you want to install flash 7 or 9 ?
[06:10] <function1> crimsun: yea so running timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os1l -s 44100 and then trying to do something like 'pmidi -p 128:0 mymid.mid' doesnt play anything
[06:11] <jmx> 9 I guess
[06:11] <function1> however just doing timidity mymid.mid works
[06:11] <squidly> variant: grub can?? i didnt know that.. i'm used to lilo for booting
[06:11] <specialbuddy> how do you write a script to perform a command when you run it?
[06:11] <variant> squidly: yeah, grub is very very powerful. lilo is a bit limmited
[06:11] <crimsun> function1: instead of amidi?
[06:11] <squidly> variant: yea I know that is why i'm teaching my self grub.
[06:11] <DanaG> I tried snd-emu10k1-synth and snd-emux-synth.
[06:11] <Jordan_U> jmx: 9 is beta, it is more likely to crash but IMO the fixes to problems with flash 7 make up for it.
[06:11] <function1> but when i do use the pmidi -p 128:0 mymid.mid i do see stuff in the terminal i opened timidity in
[06:11] <function1> k lemme try amidi
[06:12] <DanaG> They played (once I loaded soundfonts), but they froze after a short time.
[06:12] <variant> specialbuddy: just put the command in a text file as you would write it on the command line, save it and chmod +x it then you should be able to click the textfile(script) in nautilus to have it run
[06:12] <squidly> variant: how could I setup grub to boot windoze?
[06:12] <variant> squidly: 2 secs, will get you an example

[06:14] <variant> squidly: use slackware or gentoo if you want to mess around like that. ubuntu sucks for anyone wanting to actualy learn
[06:14] <squidly> variant: ahh ok.. I'm used to sourcemage for kernel installs..
[06:14] <DanaG> Just be aware that you have to reverse the badram patch.
[06:14] <AWOSLappy> I can't get my Synaptics TouchPad to work, and I can't get my external PS/2 mouse to work either.
[06:14] <variant> squidly: ew
[06:14] <crimsun> function1: need strace -fF and ltrace, then
[06:15] <jmx> so I just download from site?
[06:15] <squidly> variant: I know linux.. I just dont have time to keep up a gentoo or slak box
[06:15] <mnepton> variant: that's ... uhhh ... i ... uhhh ... whatever ...
[06:15] <variant> squidly: what disk is windows on?
[06:15] <jmx> I dont knwo what that patch is
[06:15] <AWOSLappy> I am on Ubuntu Dapper 6.06.1 LTS and Xorg.
[06:15] <variant> squidly: and what partition?
[06:15] <function1> crimsun: so, those track function calls and stuff right? what do i need to look at, aplaymidi?
[06:15] <Jordan_U> jmx: download the .deb file from the link ubotu gave.
[06:15] <DanaG> I'd like to have a system that's more customizable, but I don't want to wait for a helluvalot of compilation.
[06:15] <squidly> variant: hda1 = windows
[06:15] <crimsun> function1: yes.
[06:15] <squidly> variant: sda and sdb = md for linux
[06:15] <variant> mnepton: that's ... uhh.. an opinion.. if you dont like it tough :)
[06:15] <Nukez> Hi
[06:16] <Nukez> I need some help with Wifi
[06:16] <AWOSLappy> Nukez, the Wii isn't even out yet.
[06:16] <AWOSLappy> Nukez, disregard my last.
[06:16] <AWOSLappy> I read it wrong :x
[06:16] <jmx> cant find link..brain fart
[06:16] <Nukez> lol
[06:16] <mnepton> variant: then express it as such.
[06:16] <variant> squidly: ok, the grub.conf should have a section with title windows rootnoverify (hd0,0) chainloader +1
[06:16] <Jordan_U> jmx: Dapper or Edgy?
[06:16] <function1> oh wow that looks scary
[06:16] <Nukez> I have looked up the wiki pages but I still cant get it working
[06:16] <squidly> variant: in /boot/grub/grub.conf?
[06:16] <variant> squidly: each on a different line
[06:17] <variant> squidly: yeah, or /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:17] <Nukez> Ubuntu seems to detect my card but when I enter my info and try to activate, it dosent work
[06:17] <mnepton> variant: my opinion is that if you think Gentoo compiles with --teach-me-linux then you're on crack.
[06:17] <roughtrader> how do I make files outside of my home directory writable and executable by default?
[06:17] <specialbuddy> in fstab, how do I give everyone rights to a drive?
[06:17] <|9mmCensor|> Is it a bad thing if your wireless device is listed as eth2 instead of wlanX
[06:17] <mnepton> |9mmCensor|: not at all
[06:17] <variant> mnepton: whats gentoo got to do with learning "linux"?
[06:17] <function1> crimsun: yea no way i could possibly interpret this with my current knowledge. thanks for help anyway
[06:17] <DanaG> My wifi is eth1.
[06:18] <crimsun> function1: pastebin it
[06:18] <|9mmCensor|> ok.
[06:18] <function1> kay
[06:18] <Nukez> anyone have any ideas as to what it could be?
[06:18] <mnepton> variant: [00:14:38]  <variant> squidly: use slackware or gentoo if you want to mess around like that. ubuntu sucks for anyone wanting to actualy learn  <--- what am i missing?
[06:18] <squidly> mnepton variant lmao
[06:18] <specialbuddy> in fstab, how do I give everyone the right to mount a drive?
[06:18] <Nukez> it cant even scan for my ssid... so would that be a driver error?
=== bokey is now known as pikipiki
[06:19] <variant> mnepton: what is your problem? you get out of bed the wrong side or somthing? I am entitled to my opinion as are you
=== pikipiki is now known as piki_piki
[06:19] <specialbuddy> in fstab, how do I give everyone the right to mount a drive?
[06:19] <variant> specialbuddy: use the option "users"
[06:19] <AWOSLappy> mnepton, variant means learning how to COMPILE the kernel, not learning how to USE the kernel :)
[06:19] <variant> specialbuddy: they will have to mount it by the mount point
[06:19] <squidly> ok ill brb
[06:19] <mnepton> variant: "use Gentoo because Ubuntu sucks if you want to learn Linux. not that using Gentoo has anything to do with learning Linux." seems to be what you're saying. and when called on it, you start the personal jibes. really stellar.
[06:20] <variant> AWOSLappy: i wasnt talking about the kernel
[06:20] <squidly> variant: time to reboot and check some things thanks.. hopefully this works
[06:20] <mchonis> hey all, I'm lookin 2 buy a USB game controller, anybody know a good one that works with ubuntu?
[06:20] <Jewfro-Macabbi> sizzam, worked like a charm
[06:20] <mnepton> AWOSLappy: you can compile a kernel in Ubuntu as easily as in Gentoo
[06:20] <squidly> mnepton: gentoo has the "gentoo" way
[06:20] <matroblend> Where do I go to find out how to install debs from sf.com as the add remove programs does not have the program I want to install?
[06:20] <mnepton> which is rarely the "right way" ;)
[06:20] <squidly> ok brb variant thanks for you help
[06:20] <AWOSLappy> variant, mnepton, Wowsers I really messed up :P
[06:20] <sizzam> Jewfro-Macabbi: yep, i just tried it as well, i'm trying to write a script to convert them all in one shot now
[06:20] <squidly> mnepton: heh IMHO yea.. they do there own thing..
[06:21] <squidly> anywho brb (hopefully)
[06:21] <jmx> DAPPER I think
[06:21] <variant> mnepton: for a start, i didnt say "linux" that being hte kernel. and imo, gentoo _is_ good if you want to learn to be familiar with the command line as it makes much more effort to make people comfertable in this environment whereas ubuntu activly trys to stop people having to use the command line
[06:21] <jmx> I had to upgrade allday
[06:21] <jmx> for a lil while
[06:21] <variant> mnepton: feel free to have the last word. i hate pointless arguments like this
[06:21] <B_166-ER-X> !xdtv
[06:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xdtv - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:21] <Jewfro-Macabbi> sizzam, here's a script for doing it with mencoder: http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/22/2121258&tid=39
[06:21] <mnepton> variant: do you think a Linux that forces people to "emerge everything_useful" stands a snowball's chance in hell in fixing Bug #1?
[06:22] <variant> /ignore pwns
[06:22] <crimsun> mnepton: (sorry, your smoke break is a far better use of time )
[06:23] <GigaClon> weird problem, some times when i browse to a website it directs me to noj.asp or audit.asp even though those pages don't exist on that server, it also seems to be independant of the website
[06:23] <globe> hello all
[06:23] <Nukez> so does anyone have any ideas as to what the broblem could be?
[06:23] <mnepton> variant: 99% of users have no idea what a kernel is, never mind an interest in compiling one. if you're intrigued enough to try to compile your own kernel, you can do it on Ubuntu as easily as on Gentoo.
[06:23] <specialbuddy> can only root mount things?
[06:23] <jokoon> someone advised me to use artmanager to set themes on gnome on ubuntu ... any suggestions ?
[06:23] <DanaG> I do like the Ubuntu art.
[06:23] <Jordan_U> jmx: ( to find what version of Ubuntu you have ) What is the output of: cat /etc/*version ?
[06:23] <variant> specialbuddy: no, users can mount them too if they are specified in the fstab
[06:23] <DanaG> Except for the fact that the metacity colors don't match progressbar colors.
[06:23] <mnepton> specialbuddy: correct
[06:24] <mnepton> specialbuddy: but you can change that in fs ... never mind
[06:24] <variant> specialbuddy: only root can specify a new mount point or mount a device not the fstab
[06:24] <specialbuddy> I'm trying to set up a script for mounting my harddrives
[06:24] <function1> crimsun: http://pastebin.com/826368
[06:24] <specialbuddy> because I want them to go to specific locations and every other way is hard to figure out
[06:24] <function1> sorry for the wait
[06:24] <variant> specialbuddy: what do you want to do exactlyu? it might be better to do it with udev
[06:24] <B_166-ER-X> i just installed a Winfast TV tuner 2000Xp , and although i can watch composite1 with xawtv, i cannot (i dont know why) record what i see,  could someone tell me of a good 'tv tuner' app that runs on Edgy ?  thankx..
[06:25] <variant> specialbuddy: thats a udev job
[06:25] <Jordan_U> specialbuddy: It would probably be better to just set up your fstab.
[06:25] <variant> specialbuddy: take a look at how to make udev rules
[06:25] <|9mmCensor|> oh, I just noticed I have two wireless devices, one is the stock intel broadcom built in device(eth1).  should I turn that OFF to use my orinoco card(eth2)???

[06:25] <crimsun> function1: no time right now to look; I'll try in an hour
[06:25] <AWOSLappy> Can anybody please help me?  I'm in desparate need of help.
[06:25] <variant> specialbuddy: they are really cool
[06:25] <function1> crimsun: okay :)
[06:25] <mnepton> AWOSLappy: with ... ?
[06:25] <Jordan_U> AWOSLappy: What is the problem?
[06:25] <variant> specialbuddy: but yeah, if its static devices then fstab is best.. usb keys or somthing then you might want to go with udev
[06:25] <AWOSLappy> I can't get my Synaptics TouchPad to work, and I can't get my external PS/2 mouse to work either.
[06:25] <DanaG> hmm...
[06:26] <mnepton> AWOSLappy: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:26] <AWOSLappy> And at boot time the bcm43xx module causes a page fault in modprobe
[06:26] <variant> AWOSLappy: not with that kernel eh?
[06:26] <specialbuddy> I'm going to be unplugging and plugging variant
[06:26] <DanaG> Good luck finding modelines.....
[06:26] <AWOSLappy> variant, hmm?
[06:26] <specialbuddy> udev is confusing
[06:26] <specialbuddy> I just want to script on the desktop to mount the harddrive
[06:26] <variant> specialbuddy: well, you can specify the sysfs UUID or name in fstab
[06:26] <AWOSLappy> mneption, X works otherwise.  I mean, the keyboard, the TFT, everything else works.
[06:26] <B_166-ER-X> !xawtv

[06:27] <specialbuddy> variant, what do you mean?
[06:27] <variant> specialbuddy: you know there is a disk mounter in the gnome-panel.. right click it and add to panel > disk mounter

[06:27] <matroblend>  Where do I go to find out how to install debs from sf.com as the add remove programs does not have the program I want to install?
[06:27] <mnepton> AWOSLappy: move the existing config aside, reconfigure and get the input devices working, then meld the pertinent bits into the old config
[06:27] <DanaG> AWOSLappy: do you see errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
[06:27] <Jordan_U> matroblend: What program?
[06:27] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, yes!
[06:28] <AWOSLappy> mnepton, okay
[06:28] <matroblend> Make human
[06:28] <DanaG> pastebin at least the error lines.
[06:28] <specialbuddy> I want them to mount to a specific location variant
[06:28] <variant> AWOSLappy: can you get a hold of a laptop to ssh from?
[06:28] <mnepton> AWOSLappy: just keep copies of *everything* in case of disaster
[06:28] <variant> specialbuddy: yes, specify the location in fstab
[06:28] <AWOSLappy> variant, I am *on* my laptop
[06:28] <AWOSLappy> mnepton, what do I need to copy?
[06:28] <variant> AWOSLappy: i mean, an alternative system
[06:28] <AWOSLappy> variant, well I have a nice server here with ssh
[06:29] <specialbuddy> where is the disk mounter variant?
[06:29] <variant> AWOSLappy: I thought you couldnt log in (because the keyboard etc is not working)
[06:29] <AWOSLappy> variant, no...?  just the mouse.
[06:29] <Jordan_U> matroblend: Make Human ?
[06:29] <variant> specialbuddy: in the gnome-panel add to panel window
[06:29] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, how do I select the text without a mouse?!
[06:29] <variant> AWOSLappy: ah, could have sworn you said keyboard and mouse
[06:29] <DanaG> aah....
[06:29] <matroblend> Yes it is a 3D program
[06:29] <AWOSLappy> variant I said above -> X works otherwise.  I mean, the keyboard, the TFT, everything else works.
[06:29] <DanaG> Well, perhaps just describe the errors.
[06:30] <AWOSLappy> variant, also -> I can't get my Synaptics TouchPad to work, and I can't get my external PS/2 mouse to work either.

[06:34] <alieas> hello
[06:34] <specialbuddy> variant, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32263/
[06:34] <DanaG> well, I don't know what to do...
[06:34] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, noooo!   :-( :-( :-( :-(
[06:35] <DanaG> oh, do you see any /dev/input/*
[06:35] <AWOSLappy> ls -al /dev/input/*
[06:35] <AWOSLappy> event0  event1  mice
[06:35] <DanaG> try going to text mode and catting random ones, then move the mouse.
[06:35] <DanaG> I see -- there are no mice there.
[06:35] <matroblend> Where do I go to find out how to install debs from sf.com as the add remove programs does not have the program I want to install?
[06:35] <AWOSLappy> !
[06:35] <Jordan_U> matroblend: There is a .deb file for Ubuntu : http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=150931
[06:35] <TheGino> Can i import the firefox bookmark file from a window base partition to the linux partition with fire and is it safe?
[06:35] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, could it be that it just so happened when I rebooted the computer the touchpad died?
[06:36] <variant> specialbuddy: change vfat to auto and user to users
[06:36] <Jordan_U> matroblend: Just double click the .deb file.
[06:36] <TheGino> firefox^
[06:36] <specialbuddy> thanks
[06:36] <matroblend> Yes Jordan But I don't know how to install it properly
[06:36] <DanaG> That wouldn't explain the external one failing.
[06:36] <Zambezi> Anybody now what "openssl's crypto" is?
[06:36] <DanaG> Though...
[06:36] <variant> specialbuddy: /media/usbmedia has to exist as well
[06:36] <variant> specialbuddy: the directory
[06:36] <function1> is there some new equivalent to alsaconf? its not in synaptic and its not on my system
[06:36] <DanaG> wait, I think my dad had an old notebook where the touchpad died, and the ps/2 port stopped working.
[06:36] <specialbuddy> it exists
[06:36] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, could the PS/2 controller have died?
[06:36] <variant> specialbuddy: then to mount it as a user you would just do mount /media/usbmedia
[06:37] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, really.
[06:37] <DanaG> so that IS possible....
[06:37] <Jordan_U> matroblend: What do you mean by properly?
[06:37] <crimsun> function1: we removed alsaconf from Hoary because it's unmaintained.
[06:37] <variant> crimsun: thats a shame, it was very very good
[06:37] <linuxd> hi i am installing ubuntu my ferst time
[06:37] <linuxd> can some help
[06:37] <alieas> I have installed Edgy on a laptop.  top reports constant 45% CPU usage, but does not show the offender.  xorg is only taking up 1% if that, and it is the biggest hog on the list.  How is this possible?  Is there a way I can find out what program is causing this?  thanks
[06:37] <crimsun> variant: or very, very crappy depending if you have to maintain it.
[06:37] <variant> crimsun: hahah
[06:37] <linuxd> on the desktop i have insall
[06:37] <function1> well it seems i have not asound.conf, and i think thats a problem
[06:38] <Jordan_U> linuxd: Sure :)
[06:38] <crimsun> in any case, alsaconf is the wrong solution. The kernel should be fixed to enumerate PnP events.
[06:38] <crimsun> function1: no, asoundrc is not your issue.
[06:38] <genericuser> there's a package that was included in an earlier version of ubuntu and I'm wondering how to update it.
[06:38] <genericuser> It's Lilypond version 2.6

[06:38] <genericuser> They're now up to 2.10 and i would really like to update.
[06:39] <specialbuddy> variant, mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda7, missing codepage or other error
[06:39] <function1> no just one
[06:39] <variant> specialbuddy: did you make vfat to auto?
[06:39] <specialbuddy> yeah
[06:39] <variant> specialbuddy: you dont need the hotplug option
[06:39] <globe> anybody in here use beryl?
[06:40] <function1> crimsun: sorry i dont mean to push my problem on you, the alsaconf question i thought anyone could answer
[06:40] <variant> specialbuddy: or nodev
[06:40] <specialbuddy> ok
[06:40] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, so the PS/2 controller is shot on the mobo or what?
[06:40] <linuxd> on the server i have riad one when i cam to instaling give me two hard diks why
[06:40] <DanaG> That is a possibility.
[06:40] <AWOSLappy> :-(

[06:42] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, HP does know about this -- they said the CPU loses contact with the mobo for a split second -- Windows cannot handle this, but I guess something in the Linux kernel makes it able to handle it
[06:42] <DanaG> Try hal-device-manager
[06:42] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, and something else on this motherboard has a service bulletin on it (I'm a tech)
[06:43] <linuxd> can some one help
[06:43] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, so I would definitely believe that the PS/2 controller is shot
[06:43] <DanaG> aah, in 'hal-device-manager'
[06:43] <DanaG> look under 'platform device'
[06:43] <DanaG> (you may have to install the package hal-device-manager)
[06:43] <AWOSLappy> bash: hal-device-manager: command not found
[06:43] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, sudo or no sudo?
[06:44] <DanaG> When you install it, it shows up in the Gnome menus.  it's a Gnome program.
[06:44] <DanaG> You can alt-f1 to get the panel menu
[06:44] <DanaG> then use arrow keys.
[06:44] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, secretly, I have KDE installed.  I hate GNOME.
[06:44] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, just #kubuntu is always dead
[06:44] <AWOSLappy> so I come in here, I mean #kubuntu had no clue, he said just reinstall -- and I wasn't gonna do that
[06:45] <DanaG> hmm, I don't see any easy way to see where it is in the KDE menu.
[06:45] <AWOSLappy> I just typed it in the Konsole
[06:45] <DanaG> aah.
[06:45] <AWOSLappy> I am in the Device Manager
[06:45] <AWOSLappy> DANG this is a COOL app, I love hardware :)
[06:45] <DanaG> Look down a ways -- it shows up for me as Platform Device (i8042) / i8042 Aux Port
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> I only have one
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> Platform Device (i8042) \ i8042 Kbd Port \ AT Raw Set 2 keyboard
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> but I do have this:
[06:46] <frediie> is it possible to resize my root partition ?\
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> PnP Device (SYN1015)
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> frediie, Yes!  gparted
[06:46] <AWOSLappy> !gparted
[06:46] <ubotu> gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[06:46] <frediie> i tried gparted
[06:47] <AWOSLappy> DanaG: So my Touchpad is an unrecognised PnP device
[06:47] <frediie> it doesnt have option to resize ext3
[06:47] <frediie> ihas option to resize fat
[06:47] <AWOSLappy> what goon made gparted with ext3 resize support!?
[06:47] <frediie> oh no
[06:47] <frediie> i tried qtparted
[06:47] <specialbuddy> variant, my ext2 partition isn't showing up
[06:47] <specialbuddy> it won't mount
[06:47] <AWOSLappy> frediie, get the LiveCD
[06:47] <linuxd> i am installing ubuntu i have problem i am raid hardware 1 he ask me to select a disk way becouse i am riad one
[06:47] <AWOSLappy> frediie, http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[06:47] <frediie> alright ill give it a go...thank
[06:48] <frediie> o
[06:48] <AWOSLappy> frediie no problem :)
[06:48] <DanaG> Well, the right panel on that device manager is pretty not useful.
[06:48] <DanaG> Do you see the touchpad or the mouse?
[06:48] <AWOSLappy> DanaG not true, it has advanced tab
[06:48] <globe> has anybody ever had beryl tell them that the screen is taken?
[06:48] <variant> frediie: you need a recent version of gparted (not in apt) ang you need to have all the right filesystem utils installed
[06:48] <DanaG> oh.... I gorgot that one.
[06:48] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, touchpad only, but I didn't have the mouse plugged in until after boot.
[06:48] <variant> specialbuddy: i thought it was vfat?
[06:48] <AWOSLappy> I've got:
[06:48] <specialbuddy> one of them is
[06:48] <linuxd> can some help here
[06:48] <DanaG> hmm.  Well, that means the PS/2 controller is fine.
[06:48] <frediie> thanks guys
[06:49] <variant> specialbuddy: ok, so one of them is now working?
[06:49] <DanaG> try to rmmod psmouse
[06:49] <DanaG> and then re-modprobe it
[06:49] <specialbuddy> yeah
[06:49] <AWOSLappy> DanaG -- bus: pnp     linux.driver: i8042 aux    parent: /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer
[06:49] <AWOSLappy> DanaG okay I will
[06:49] <linuxd> i am installing ubuntu i have problem i am raid hardware 1 he ask me to select a disk way becouse i am riad one
[06:49] <variant> specialbuddy: what is the problem with the other one then?
[06:49] <specialbuddy> it won't mount
[06:49] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, now I restart X or what?
[06:49] <variant> specialbuddy: what is the error?
[06:50] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, no change in the contents of /dev/input though
[06:50] <DanaG> hmm.
[06:50] <DanaG> I wonder if dmesg says anything useful.
[06:50] <AWOSLappy> Dang, the mouse does not move the cursor on screen though
[06:50] <AWOSLappy> rather DanaG, the mouse does not move the cursor on screen though
[06:51] <AWOSLappy> DanaG: the last thing in dmesg is about my NIC
[06:51] <specialbuddy> well that mount thing only worked until I unplugged my harddrive and plugged it back in
[06:51] <variant> specialbuddy: you want it to mount automatically?
[06:51] <DanaG> Well, if there's no /dev/input/mouse*, then it seems like xorg is not to blame.
[06:51] <AWOSLappy> OKAY
[06:51] <specialbuddy> yeah
[06:51] <AWOSLappy> here is problem in dmesg:
[06:51] <variant> specialbuddy: then you need a udev rule
[06:51] <jmx> hey..how do I look at my memory n stuff
[06:51] <AWOSLappy> this will take a while to type out, is that okay?
[06:52] <specialbuddy> well I don't know anything about that
[06:52] <AWOSLappy> NO!!!!!
[06:52] <variant> specialbuddy: read through this: http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html it is very good howto and it explains exactly what you have to do
[06:52] <AWOSLappy> Come back DanaG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[06:52] <AWOSLappy> x_x
[06:52] <keithhhhh> hi Is Compiz an addon to XGL or is it another management system?
[06:52] <variant> keithhhhh: compiz is a window manager
[06:52] <specialbuddy> thanks for everything variant
[06:53] <variant> keithhhhh: you would be better iwth beryl and beryl-manager
[06:53] <AWOSLappy> !pastebin
[06:53] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[06:53] <SilentDis> hello :)
[06:53] <variant> keithhhhh: beryl/compiz run ontop of xgl or aiglx
[06:53] <tyler_> hey all I got my dlink dwl 650 + to at least load the firmware according to dmesg but I can't see any wireless networks any ideas?
[06:53] <keithhhhh> variant: ah
[06:54] <keithhhhh> variant: so then what is the minimum requirements for AIGLX do you know?
[06:54] <keithhhhh> variant: I cant run XGL unfortunately
[06:54] <variant> keithhhhh: think of xgl/aiglx and compiz/beryl being analogous to xorg-x11 and fluxbox/windowmaker/metacity
[06:54] <keithhhhh> variant: I have an ATI 9000
[06:54] <murali> my protocol for connecting gaim with yahoo is blocked
[06:54] <SilentDis> quicky question:  are there any packages available to allow me to use the remote from my Creative Live Drive with Dapper?  i'd like to map some of the keys and such (specificially, a kill current app and a restart x command, if possible)
[06:54] <variant> keithhhhh: any relativly decent integrated graphics card
[06:54] <DanaG> er, Xorg crashed
[06:54] <jmx> how do I look at my memory n stuff anyone?
[06:54] <variant> keithhhhh: excellent, that will work very well
[06:54] <murali> can u pls tell me how to activate it
[06:54] <variant> keithhhhh: i run aiglx with a radeon 7000 igp
[06:55] <variant> keithhhhh: and it is very smooth
[06:55] <DanaG> last thing I saw was 'this will take a while to type out'
[06:55] <keithhhhh> variant: ok now just need to find aiglx documentation.... was it easy to install?
[06:55] <variant> keithhhhh: aiglx is better than xgl
[06:55] <linuxd> any one have riad 1 on his computer help please
[06:55] <keithhhhh> variant: cool thanks  ;)
[06:55] <variant> keithhhhh: yes very, are you using edgy?
[06:55] <keithhhhh> variant: no :( 6.06
[06:55] <DanaG> nvidia > aiglx > xgl
[06:55] <Jordan_U> jmx: System -> administration -> System monitor.
[06:55] <tyler_> Oh edgy why do  you mock me, my wireless card worked great in dapper, it was literally plug and play but edgy is driving me nuts
=== pc5 is now known as ReYnoLd_ubaya
[06:56] <variant> keithhhhh: ok, you should have to upgrade to edgy iirc but then aiglx is installed and ready to go by default (its part of xorg-x11 in edgy) all you need to do is install beryl and beryl-manager
[06:56] <AWOSLappy> DanaG!
[06:56] <AWOSLappy> what happened DanaG?
[06:56] <DanaG> aah, xorg had crashed.
[06:57] <DanaG> I'm back.
[06:57] <AWOSLappy> DanaG ah
[06:57] <keithhhhh> variant: hmmm
[06:57] <linuxd> any one can help here or not
[06:57] <keithhhhh> variant: thanks alot Ill get back to you if things work out  hehe
[06:57] <linuxd> gut i need to know i have riad 1 hardware and in ubuntu i have 2 hard diks why
[06:58] <linuxd> i do riad 1
[06:58] <CarlFK> "unable to load libmysqlclient.so" -libmysqlclient14 is already the newest version.  why?
[06:58] <linuxd> it only one hardik supose not 2
[06:58] <variant> keithhhhh: np, gl
[06:58] <variant> im off. gnight all
[06:58] <variant> 6am here :)
[06:58] <SilentDis> linuxd:  if you don't get an answer right away, don't be deturred. people come and go constantly.  if 'the room' doesn't know right now, wait 10 min, and try asking again ;)
[06:59] <AWOSLappy> Goodnight variant.
[06:59] <linuxd> ok
[06:59] <Jordan_U> linuxd: It seems nobody has experience with RAID right now, but it is late ( in my time zone at least ) so you might try earlier tomorrow, or ubuntuforums, qunu.com can be helpfull sometimes also.
[06:59] <linuxd> ok thank you
[07:00] <tokeman> Howde! I have a question, I am trying to get libflashplayer.so to my firefox plug in folder how do I get "Permision" or log on as root to extract that to my plug ins folder?
[07:00] <SilentDis> out of curiosity...
[07:00] <DanaG> I think I should go to bed soon too.
[07:00] <SilentDis> !raid
[07:00] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[07:00] <Jewfro-Macabbi> tokeman, sudo
[07:00] <DanaG> well, kinda soon.
[07:00] <tokeman> ok sudo running now
[07:00] <AWOSLappy> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32266/
[07:00] <Jordan_U> SilentDis: Oh, Maybe I should have given your advice :)
[07:00] <AWOSLappy> ^ BAD error.
[07:00] <SilentDis> tokeman: installing the beta 9 player I take it?
[07:00] <tokeman> yes thats it
[07:01] <bhudda> How do you exit and/or quit a virtual console?
[07:01] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, there's a pastebin of a BAD error in dmesg.
[07:01] <AWOSLappy> bhudda, exit
[07:01] <bhudda> Tried that, just logs me out of the console, and keeps it up
[07:01] <DanaG> HMM, [er, caps] 
[07:01] <tokeman> <SilentDis>yes the 9 beta
[07:01] <DanaG> crash stack trace.
[07:01] <AWOSLappy> bhudda, right, then File->Exit or the X button on the title bar.
[07:01] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, yep.
[07:02] <DanaG> Sometime I get "Soft lockup in CPU#0" on my system.
[07:02] <bhudda> OK will try that. Thanks!
[07:02] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, really?
[07:02] <digi_> hey guys, how do I connect to another server, like "irc.neowin.net"?
[07:02] <AWOSLappy> bhudda, np :)
[07:02] <SilentDis> tokeman:  you have 2 options - do you want the plugin available to all users on the system, or just you?
[07:02] <SilentDis> Jordan_U:  i totally space out ubotu a lot.  i shouldn't, he's rather helpful ;)
[07:02] <AWOSLappy> digi_, try /connect irc.neowin.net
[07:03] <jokoon> Firefox 2 just start and immediatly crashes, how can I revert all settings to default ?
[07:03] <tokeman> <SilentDis> well i'm the only user soo all would work on my main account
[07:03] <AWOSLappy> GRR.
[07:03] <DanaG> firefox --safe-mode
[07:03] <jokoon> thanks
[07:03] <AWOSLappy> Are you guys EVER going to add Firefox 2 to the Dapper repos?
[07:03] <DanaG> ...Bhudda mode on
[07:03] <DanaG> .
[07:04] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, well is there a fix?  or shall I file a bug?
[07:04] <digi_> I tried to type /connect irc.neowin.net, but nothing happed
[07:04] <jokoon> DanaG doesnt work
[07:04] <AWOSLappy> It also causes my system to hang for about 5 minutes on bootup
[07:04] <DanaG> I don't know that one.
[07:04] <AWOSLappy> with '/sbin/modprobe': Premature exit    or something like that, not sure of exact wording
[07:04] <DanaG> hahfunny: http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-24
[07:05] <jokoon> owkey
[07:05] <jokoon> No more internet browser for me
[07:06] <AWOSLappy> DanaG haha
[07:06] <rawrness> Whats add/remove programs run off of?
=== livingdaylight is now known as nife
[07:06] <AWOSLappy> rawrness, synaptic.
[07:07] <Flannel> rawrness: itself
[07:07] <rawrness> kk
[07:07] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, um, is that error somehow related to the touchpad problem?
[07:07] <rawrness> I am using kde but i liked synaptics add/remove better
[07:07] <Flannel> rawrness: but, the more complete GUI thing is synaptic
[07:07] <haxality> hey, I would like to remove esd from my 6.06 installation
[07:07] <Xpression> does anyone know how to implement data compression under squid ?
[07:07] <AWOSLappy> is there a #UbuntuLevel2 room or something?  hehe
[07:07] <luminousnerd> Hey folks
[07:08] <AWOSLappy> Hey luminousnerd.
[07:08] <AWOSLappy> haxality, sudo apt-get remove esd
[07:08] <DanaG> Well, your issue may go above #ubuntu
[07:08] <haxality> it says that I need to remove ubuntu-desktop, but I remember before I had no problems getting rid of it
[07:08] <luminousnerd> Is there a decent program that will record your screen & audio and produce a nicely compressed video file of some sort?
[07:08] <haxality> thank you
[07:08] <DanaG> so look at #linux
[07:08] <DanaG> or #kernel
[07:08] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, ah okay.
[07:08] <DanaG> Or ubuntu-developers
[07:08] <AWOSLappy> haxality, correct, removing ubuntu-desktop is no problem.
[07:08] <DanaG> or whatever it is.
[07:08] <haxality> ah, ok
[07:08] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, which one?  ubuntu-dev or ##linux?
[07:08] <haxality> what is ubuntu-desktop, anyways?
[07:08] <haxality> it sounded important
[07:08] <Akuma_> i was to set up a linux/window LAN .. what do i have to look into?
[07:08] <DanaG> I say, try them all.
[07:09] <Akuma_> *windows
[07:09] <Flannel> Akuma_: getting a router
[07:09] <jamin06> can i get help with "make"
[07:09] <Flannel> haxality: it's a meta package, depending on everything you need to have the full, complete "ubuntu" system
[07:09] <AWOSLappy> haxality, it is a metapackage with all the packages of a default ubuntu install.  e.g. apt-get install ubuntu-desktop will restore all the default programs.
[07:09] <Jordan_U> !ubuntu-desktop | haxality
[07:09] <ubotu> haxality: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[07:09] <Akuma_> Flannel: i have all that. i used to have a windows/winows lan, i just want to know how i can do the same with linix. there just isn't a simple wizard as in windows
[07:09] <Akuma_> *linux
[07:09] <AWOSLappy> Akuma_ You need two LAN cards if you want to share the Internet
[07:10] <Flannel> Akuma_: you mean sharing and stuff?  Since, technically, they're in a LAN right now.  If you want file sharing and stuff, see !samba
[07:10] <haxality> apparently esd isn't installed.. but some parts of it are
[07:10] <haxality> what gives?
[07:10] <haxality> I basically just want to get rid of the bloat and the system sounds
[07:11] <Akuma_> AWOSLappy: Flannel: sorry, you're right, i used the wrong term. i guess file sharing specifically is what i meant. i'll look into samba, thanks
[07:11] <Flannel> !samba | Akuma_
[07:11] <ubotu> Akuma_: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:11] <AWOSLappy> Akuma_ ah okay.
[07:12] <luminousnerd> Hey, is there a decent app that will record your screen & audio and turn it into a video file of some sort?
[07:12] <rawrness> whats the command for the add/remote thingy off the menu for synaptic?
[07:13] <Linuturk> I've noticed I now have the option to rotate my screen in the System > Preferences > Screen Resolution menu!!! This is great!! now, I just need a way for it to automatically rotate when I swivel the screen down. OR, a command line option so I can create a panel launcher
[07:13] <v3rmap> Hi, I'm not able to access my Ubuntu shares from Windows (the enter password dialog keeps popping up). Any suggestions?
[07:13] <AWOSLappy> DanaG, FYI it is actually #ubuntu-devel
[07:13] <DanaG> Time to reboot to WIndows to use Microsoft FTM.
[07:13] <haxality> uhhh
[07:14] <haxality> am I going to lose any important gnome stuff if I uninstall ubuntu-desktop
[07:14] <AWOSLappy> haxality, NO.
[07:14] <Flannel> rawrness: what?
[07:14] <Akuma_> Flannel: thats what i needed, thanks
[07:14] <haxality> ok, thank you.
[07:14] <Flannel> haxality: no.  You'll lose nothing.
[07:14] <haxality> sorry, but synaptic makes it look super-important for some reason
[07:14] <haxality> I just wanted to make sure
[07:14] <v3rmap> Hi, I'm not able to access my Ubuntu shares from Windows (the enter password dialog keeps popping up). Any suggestions?
[07:15] <Flannel> !samba | v3rmap, it's explained in here
[07:15] <ubotu> v3rmap, it's explained in here: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:15] <Flannel> believe the second link is where it's ended up
[07:16] <TheMoebius> if I want to resize my NTFS windows partition to make space for ubuntu is it safe to use the partitioner in the ubuntu installer?
[07:17] <haxality> ok.. it says it's removing stuff like gconf-editor..
[07:17] <Flannel> haxality: you must be removing something else then, not just ubuntu-desktop
[07:17] <v3rmap> Flannel: does that mean merely doing a right click in nautilus, choosing "Share Folder", selecting "SMB" is not going to do it?
[07:18] <haxality> ah its ok, can always reinstall it
[07:18] <zroberous> <TheMoebius> it is safe, but always back up important stuff anyway
[07:18] <Flannel> v3rmap: No idea.  I don't use samba, I just know the 'mounting sans password' thing is addressed
[07:19] <luminousnerd> !beryl

[07:22] <morgue> hey i'm trying to format a floppy and i get error "Could not determine current floppy geometry."
[07:22] <morgue> using an external drive
[07:22] <rawrness> If i deleted the add and remove button off the menu whats the command for it so i can readd it
[07:24] <Gog123> hi
[07:26] <morgue> why do you think I'm getting the error Could not determine current floppy geometry.
[07:26] <TheMoebius> is there a program in gnome that I can use to visually explore what is taking all my hard drive space? I know there is a view in konquer that does it but I'm in gnome...
[07:27] <rawrness> I think its Klight or something
[07:27] <rawrness> It runs in gnome good i think.
[07:27] <rawrness> I am not sure what i was running at that time.
[07:27] <morgue> any suggestions for my problem?
[07:28] <nuts> 3is there a command for removing a package just like u install with apt-get install?
[07:28] <luminousnerd> Are there any "real" games for Ubuntu?
[07:28] <Q_Continuum> Remote Desktop - how can I change the port that it uses?
[07:28] <AWOSLappy> luminousnerd, like what?
[07:28] <AWOSLappy> nuts, apt-get remove :)
[07:28] <morgue> nuts: apt-get remove
[07:28] <nuts> haha
[07:28] <nuts> could have checked that
[07:28] <AWOSLappy> :)
[07:29] <luminousnerd> AWOSLappy: I'm not sure. Like First-Person-Shooters or maybe realtime strategys?  The closest I know is Wesnoth, the turn-based one
[07:29] <morgue> the floppy is working :(
[07:29] <TheMoebius> luminousnerd: UT 2004 works and Neverwinter nights work natively in linux and there are others, plus you can use wine to play many windows games in linux
[07:29] <luminousnerd> I guess I mean 3d, and playable against other real people or something
[07:29] <TheMoebius> luminousnerd: there are whole websites dedicated to this subject
[07:29] <luminousnerd> Ut2k4 is linux-compatible?
[07:29] <morgue> yep
[07:29] <luminousnerd> Will it be a pain in the ass to install?>
[07:30] <morgue> nope
[07:30] <luminousnerd> Cool
[07:30] <morgue> the demo is pretty much point and click
[07:30] <luminousnerd> Oh, Doom does too doesn't it
[07:30] <AWOSLappy> luminousnerd, also I believe that Quake thing is in the repos somewhere
[07:30] <morgue> should
[07:30] <morgue> quake 3 is harder
[07:30] <luminousnerd> Any free or free trial good ones?  In the mood for a game right now lol
[07:30] <morgue> ut2k4
[07:30] <morgue> demo
[07:31] <morgue> easiest imho
[07:31] <luminousnerd> sweet
[07:31] <luminousnerd> Didn't know they had a demo
[07:31] <luminousnerd> that frickin rocks
[07:31] <morgue> yeah it has ons, assault, ctf and dm
[07:31] <luminousnerd> On the official site or just google for a trial?
[07:31] <TheMoebius> quake 4 is quite easy as well
[07:31] <Jordan_U_> How do I make the the volume keys change the PCM level instead of the master level ( Or rather, how can I make it so the master volume effects applications using OSS )?
[07:31] <morgue> either
[07:32] <luminousnerd> If I go out and buy UT2k4 do I need to look for a linux version or is it just part of it?
[07:32] <morgue> Does anybody know why am I get this error when I'm trying format a floppy drive? Could not determine current floppy geometry.
[07:32] <luminousnerd> Thanks for the help and suggestions guys
[07:32] <morgue> luminousnerd: you'd be getting a linux version
[07:32] <zroberous> <morgue> what kind of drive is it ?
[07:32] <luminousnerd> ah, ok
[07:32] <morgue> zroberous: external
[07:32] <zroberous> <morgue> zip ?
[07:33] <luminousnerd> Well, like, Warcraft comes with both Mac and Windows on the same disk
[07:33] <luminousnerd> I wonder if that one can be wine'd (time for a google :)
[07:33] <morgue> zroberous: 3 1/4
[07:33] <Jordan_U_> luminousnerd, xmoto is an awesome game IMHO, its in the repos too ( I am not a gamer though , and it is 2D so you may not like it as much )
[07:34] <zroberous> <morgue> have you tried another disk ?
[07:34] <morgue> zroberous: it reads other another floppy disk i have
[07:34] <luminousnerd> Ok I'll give that one a shot Jordan_U_
[07:35] <zroberous> <morgue> sounds like you have a bad disk then
[07:35] <Jordan_U_> luminousnerd, I just figured it out actually :)
[07:35] <_3uG_> does anyone have any idea how to get a gameport sidewinder to work in edgy? it worked *just fine* in dapper...
[07:35] <luminousnerd> Globulation 2 sounds interesting
[07:35] <Jordan_U_> luminousnerd, About 2 seconds before your post even :) thanks anyways though.
[07:35] <luminousnerd> Jordan_U_: figured what out?
[07:36] <morgue> zroberous: I can't format the same floppy disk I can read
[07:36] <Fastly> hello god?
[07:36] <Jordan_U_> luminousnerd, I thought you were talking about helping me with my sound issues, I forgot about the game conversation.
[07:37] <Jordan_U_> And I need sleep.
[07:37] <morgue> zroberous: I can read them but when I try formatting I get Could not determine current floppy geometry.t
[07:37] <luminousnerd> Oh I see lol
[07:37] <zroberous> <morgue> is the read only tab slid on the floppy ?
[07:37] <matahari> hi
[07:38] <hokatichenci> Hmm, this ubuntu install I'm working on is asking for a cdrom when I do apt-get install samba, how do I disable the cdrom install feature?
[07:38] <Fastly> should i tell my bird that we just screwed to crystal clear drm-free linux audio... or will she just think i am weird?
[07:38] <morgue> zroberous: no
[07:38] <matahari> is there a software for a teleconference server? I mean a software that runs on a server and people connect to it via ekiga or so, and hear all the othersd that are connected too.... the server just mixes up sound and distributes it.
[07:39] <zroberous> she will think your weird

[07:39] <_3uG_> matahari, i think that gstreamer0.10-farsight may handle that *maybe*
[07:39] <rawrness> Is he not weird?
[07:39] <zroberous> nah
[07:39] <matahari> _3uG_: wher can i look that up?
[07:40] <Fastly> yeah thought so... i'll save it until after breakfast
[07:40] <AWOSLappy> crimsun, see me?
[07:40] <matahari> _3uG_: i would need support for 10 connections
[07:40] <crimsun> AWOSLappy: yes
[07:40] <_3uG_> http://farsight.sourceforge.net/
[07:40] <morgue> zroberous: what do you think?
[07:40] <matahari> (i have a server that has enough up/downlink)
[07:40] <AWOSLappy> You are running a kernel (version 2.6.15-23-386) and attempting to remove the same version.  This is a potentially dangerous action.  Not only will /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-23-386 be removed, making it impossible to boot it, (you will have to take action to change your boot loader to boot a new kernel), it will also remove all modules under the directory /lib/modules/2.6.15-23-386.  Just having a copy of the kernel image is not enough, you will have t
[07:40] <AWOSLappy> is is very dangerous.  If at all in doubt, answer no.  If you know exactly what you are doing, and are prepared to hose your system, then answer Yes.
[07:40] <morgue> zroberous: i'm running on live cd :dunno:
[07:40] <matahari> _3uG_: thanks a lot!
[07:40] <AWOSLappy> Remove the running kernel image (not recommended) [No] ?
[07:41] <Fastly> <shameless plug>
[07:41] <zroberous> <morgue> my first thought is something is wrong with your drive, not a software problem
[07:41] <crimsun> AWOSLappy: answer Yes [that's why you have your live cd] 
[07:41] <AWOSLappy> okay.
[07:41] <_3uG_> matahari, not sure how much that link will help, though.. but it's a step in the right direction
[07:41] <zroberous> <morgue> well thats why then, didnt know that
[07:41] <morgue> zroberous: it's brand new AND i formatted one of the diskettes from windows
[07:41] <luminousnerd> Where is xorg.conf
[07:41] <morgue> zroberous: :(
[07:41] <matahari> _3uG_: how do you mean?
[07:41] <Fastly> look here ----------->>>>>>>>>>> /etc
[07:41] <morgue> zroberous: so can it be done or do i have to install ubuntu?
[07:41] <zroberous> <morgue> i don't believe you can do certain things in live
[07:42] <matahari> _3uG_: i think a 20Mbit connection should be enough
[07:42] <_3uG_> matahari, i don't know how much the link will help. hopefully it will tell you what you need to know
[07:42] <zroberous> <morgue>what are you trying to put on floppy ?
[07:42] <_3uG_> matahari, oh.. link==url
[07:42] <matahari> _3uG_: oh
[07:42] <morgue> zroberous: sata drivers so i can run winxp setup

[08:05] <dn4> AWOSLappy you said that already
[08:05] <Fastly> what's the real problem, AWOSLappy. Be specific,
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> dn4, no, I fixed the kernel version
[08:05] <flodine> 1/part
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> it isn't making the thing, I can never remember the name
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> eth1
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> it is always eth1.
[08:06] <AWOSLappy> and it isn't making it anymore
[08:06] <nevermind> hello, anyone here?
[08:06] <AWOSLappy> Nevermind, obviously.
[08:06] <rawrness> A few people
[08:06] <nevermind> lol :)
[08:06] <Fastly> i put a pizza in the oven and it didn't make the thing... pls come fix it
[08:06] <nevermind> i wonder if anyone knows how to blacklist agpgart
[08:06] <rawrness> Did you turn it on?
[08:06] <cge>  AWOSLappy, so ifconfig isn't showing any devices other than lo and a wired connection if you have one?
[08:06] <AWOSLappy> cge, correct.
[08:06] <AWOSLappy> cge, it shows eth0 and lo.
[08:07] <dn4> AWOSLappy I tend to use this site as a reference for Wifi cards to buy http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility
[08:07] <AWOSLappy> dn4 YES I know that bc43xx cards suck.  but I am stuck with it, I payed $50 for it, they won't take it back, so I am stuck with it.
[08:07] <cge>  Hmmm... I need to use a better IRC client than telnet. Let me quit and log in with xchat. Using PRIVMSG is annoying.
[08:07] <Fastly> actually i feel like a spot of general knowledge:
[08:07] <AWOSLappy> cge okay.
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> Fastly, I just don't remember what they call those ethx things.  that's all.
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> like block devices, but not
[08:08] <rawrness> hyrdairc is good for windows and konversation is good for ubuntu.
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> Konversation, yeah, that's what I use rawrness.
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> INTERFACES!
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> that's it!  it won't create the interface.
[08:08] <nevermind> i've edited /etc/modprobe..d/blacklist and jsut added 'agpgart' but it doesn't wokr, am i missing something?
[08:08] <cge> AWOSLappy: Ok. But I am assuming that it was doing so before you installed Dapper?
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> cge, hmm?  it *did* work in Windows, but now it doesn't.
[08:09] <cge> AWOSLappy: Oh
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> cge, I mean, Windows freezes if I move the laptop (literally), the WLAN quit, the Ethernet quit, the USB floppy is intermittant
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> Windows is falling apart.
[08:10] <AWOSLappy> so I did the shipit thing and the SECOND I got the LiveCD I popped it in and installed it.
[08:10] <Fastly> AWOSLappy: you're barking up the wrong tree
[08:10] <cge> AWOSLappy: Sounds like it is time for you to redo your Windows installation...
[08:10] <cge> AWOSLappy: If you still have it on.
[08:10] <AWOSLappy> cge, why?  I don't like Windows anyway.  I like Linux.

[08:17] <slax> . /var/log/syslog whaat this ???
[08:17] <AWOSLappy> cge: Nov 16 02:15:34 localhost kernel: [17181168.124000]  pccard: card ejected from slot 0
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> cge: That is all.
[08:18] <TheMoebius> I'm stuck at the point in the installation process where it launches the partitioner. Its been sitting here with the hard drive read light on for at least 5 minutes.
[08:18] <TheGino> once the deb file installs is there anything else i have to do to install or is it installed
[08:18] <cge> AWOSLappy: It shows that when you plug it in!?
[08:18] <nevermind> and as long as resolv.conf has 'nameserver x.x.x.x" as content, everything should be fine
[08:18] <amir> can anyone help me with a networking problem? wlan0 has disappeared from my Network Settings
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> cge, no, I ejected it, put it back in, and that came up when I ejected it.
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> cge, nothing came up when I put it back in.
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> cge, should it have?
[08:18] <cge> AWOSLappy: oh
[08:18] <rawrness> As soon i get more ram i am just going to make a windows machine and format it all away
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> cge, I can get a different PCMCIA card and test
[08:19] <cge> AWOSLappy: Yes. Something should have come up, even if the card wasn't supported. So yes, you should try a different card, preferably with the same sort of PCMCIA interface.
[08:19] <Fastly> rawrness: it's the answer to all computer problems.. with registry magican you will sleep and we will go up 2000% in productivity and clarity
[08:19] <Luke> nevermind: i added my router and it worked fine... i've always just edited resolv.conf by hand but there is a huge warning at th top saying not to and that it will be overwritten
[08:19] <amir> can anyone help me with a networking problem? wlan0 has disappeared from my Network Settings
[08:20] <nevermind> Luke: well, i don't know in ubuntu-server, let me look nito it
[08:20] <Fastly> sudo ifconfig <-- is he there?
[08:20] <Luke> nevermind: well adding the nameserver like I usually do worked... i'm just a little weirded out by that message
[08:21] <cge> amir, Fastly: sudo ifconfig -a would be even better
[08:21] <foo> sm-mta[23683] : kAH79jlk023681: to=<user@domain.com>, ctladdr=<www-data@myserver.com> (33/33), delay=00:00:01, xdelay=00:00:01, mailer=esmtp, pri=120745, relay=mx.domain.com. [65.25.4.51] , dsn=5.1.1, stat=User unknown - any ideas on this? I get (kAH79jlk023681 Message accepted for delivery) ... then I get that message
[08:21] <Fastly> yea, it's late
[08:21] <nevermind> Luke: well.. i dunno about the msg, mine is empty. But if it works, then you can be happy :)
[08:21] <Fastly> or early for that matter
[08:21] <Luke> nevermind: haha ok thanks =D
[08:21] <Trixsey> noobs :)
[08:21] <Fastly> you guys are all chilled
[08:21] <GirlRiver> I am in the process of setting up home directories for all my home machines on one NFS server and I also want to manage passwords centrally. Can someone advise me if I should use NIS or are there better alternatives ?

[08:23] <foo> Can someone tell me what version of gnucash is on edgy?
[08:23] <Fastly> s/that/thank/
[08:23] <nevermind> zoe: i'd recommend you to do it manually, especially when it comes to drivers install
[08:23] <cge> foo: 2.something, I believe.
[08:23] <Akuma_> does anyone know how i'm supposed to get samba's swap interface working? the doncs dont say anything else than to try localhost:901, and goodle only gives me swap memory results..
[08:23] <zoe> !ati
[08:24] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:24] <foo> cge: Hm, so it is 2. How can I get 2 on ubuntu 6.06
[08:24] <TheGino> anybody recommend a Tar file installer?
[08:24] <AWOSLappy> cge
[08:24] <amir> psht, I have changed lots of things, trying to get my broadcom 4318 card to work, and I think I inadvertently deleted it somehow.
[08:24] <GirlRiver> Can anyone recommend an alternative to NIS ? I'm using Edgy
[08:24] <AWOSLappy> cge it still didn't
[08:25] <ademan_> is there anyone in here who could speed the proccessing of https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/eclipse-cdt/+bug/68661  ?  It's a super easy fix, we just need a package of eclipse-cdt 3.1 instead of 3.0
[08:25] <cge> AWOSLappy: Hmm... it is quite probable that the computer is the problem then. Is the card working?
[08:25] <amir> cge: I have changed lots of things trying to get my broadcom 4318 wireless card to work, and I think I inadvertently deleted it somehow
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> cge, hmm?  the test card?
[08:25] <cge> AWOSLappy: yes
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> cge, it's the 3C589 III that I just installed FreeBSD through on my other laptop -- it worked last I tested (5 days ago)
[08:25] <zoe> On this macBook Pro with Edgy, lspci says 'VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 71c5'
[08:26] <B_166-ER-X> i just installed a Winfast TV tuner 2000Xp , and although i can watch composite1 with xawtv, i cannot (i dont know why) record what i see,  could someone tell me of a good 'tv tuner' app that runs on Edgy ..that i can Record with ? thnkx
[08:26] <zoe> Does this mean my video card isn't made by Intel?
[08:26] <AWOSLappy> zoe, Yes!
[08:26] <zoe> Apple makes MacBook Pros with ATI video cards?
[08:26] <AWOSLappy> zoe, Yes, almost exclusively
[08:26] <zoe> Hrmm, okay so what binary drivers can I use?
[08:26] <cge> AWOSLappy: I mean, is it working now, in this computer? I am reasonably certain that something should show up in syslog, but I may be mistaken.
[08:26] <AWOSLappy> zoe, I have the new MacMall catalog with only ATI cards
[08:26] <cge> foo: There are a variety of ways.
[08:26] <AWOSLappy> cge, um, I have no clue
[08:26] <nevermind> zoe: the chipset is what's important, in this case ati's
[08:26] <Sobko> OK bye all
[08:26] <Sobko> gtg
[08:26] <AWOSLappy> cge, how would I install a 3Com EtherLink III
[08:26] <foo> cge: What's the safety/easiest way?
[08:27] <cge> foo: I was just saying that to show that I hadn't forgotten about you, but am trying to type as fast as I can.
[08:28] <cge> foo: You could check to see if it is in Ubuntu Backports for Dapper, or request that it should be if it isn't.
[08:28] <zoe> AWOSLappy: What binary driver do I use for 3D/
[08:28] <nevermind> isn't there a .deb anywhere on the net for gnucash?
[08:28] <zoe> fglrx?
[08:28] <tritium> !gnucash
[08:28] <ubotu> gnucash: A personal finance tracking program. In component universe, is extra. Version 2.0.1-3ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 2014 kB, installed size 6388 kB
[08:28] <AWOSLappy> zoe, yes that is what I am using on my ATI RADEON
[08:28] <cge> foo: You could check the gnucash site to see if they have a deb for Dapper.
[08:28] <zoe> AWOSLappy: But lspci didn't call it a Radeon, it said unknown
[08:29] <AWOSLappy> zoe, it will work but FYI ATi cards suck on Linu
[08:29] <AWOSLappy> x
[08:29] <cge> AWOSLappy: I am rather certain that that should work by default, and should show up in ifconfig -a
[08:29] <diskus> gnucash's ui is horrible :P
[08:29] <AWOSLappy> zoe, I know, RADEON is the name of *all* portable ATi cards
[08:29] <bony> i am facing a problem with mysql it is refusing to start due to a bug in mysql-server. a bug report has been filed last month. well i am still unable to get a work around temporarily till the bug is sqashed. dose any one faced the same problem is so is there a temporary solution for it?
[08:29] <zoe> I'm aware, but it's what's in this laptop
[08:29] <AWOSLappy> cge, well I have a new one called sit0.  what is a sit0?
[08:29] <AWOSLappy> wb luminousnerd!
[08:30] <luminousnerd> Thanks
[08:30] <kraut> moin
[08:30] <cge> AWOSLappy: Just a random non-physical interfacethat shows up when you do ifconfig -a.
[08:30] <AWOSLappy> ah okay.
[08:30] <AWOSLappy> cge, then no, I don't have one
[08:30] <cge> foo: You could also upgrade to Edgy if that is acceptable to you.
[08:30] <AWOSLappy> cge, this may be a little techincal for you
[08:30] <AWOSLappy> cge, on my LTE 5150, my old 1996 notebook
[08:30] <luminousnerd> Hey, I can't get this UT 2k4 trial to unzip right (.gz) and I'm not sure if it's the lack of support for .gz (ON LINUX?! WTF?!) or just a bad file...I downloaded twice with same result, do I just need to get it from a third party?
[08:30] <dusk> how do i kill a stubborn program
[08:30] <AWOSLappy> cge, it supports CardBus using SystemSoft CardWare 5.0 on NT4.  is there a Linux equivalent of this?
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> dusk, kill -9 pid
[08:31] <foo> cge: I haven't heard good things about edgy. Kind of disappointed.
[08:31] <luminousnerd> !beryl
[08:31] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[08:31] <dusk> AWOSLappy: how do I find its pid?
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> dusk, or killall -9 programname
[08:31] <cge> AWOSLappy: I haven't heard of something like that.
[08:31] <rickyfingers> dusk: sudo kill -s 9 process id #
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> cge didn't think so
[08:31] <nevermind> dusk "killall -9 name"
[08:31] <CarinArr> luminousnerd, .gz is a very standard extension.. is it .tar.gz?
[08:31] <Lam_> what's wrong with my dvd driver?  mplayer gives me this error:
[08:31] <Lam_> File not found: 'dvd:/dev/hdc'
[08:31] <Lam_> Failed to open dvd:/dev/hdc.
[08:31] <luminousnerd> CarinArr: nope, a .run.gz
[08:31] <cge> AWOSLappy: It should work automatically in Linux if it is going to work at all.
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> cge okay
[08:31] <CarinArr> luminousnerd, then gunzip filename.run.gz
[08:31] <Fastly> this has gottten waaay out of control
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> cge for the CardBus or the EtherLink card?
[08:31] <Fastly> i've got to leave
[08:31] <Fastly> bye
[08:31] <cge> AWOSLappy: Both, actually.
[08:31] <dusk> nevermind: its firefox and "firefox" nor "mozilla-firefox" worked
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> bye Fastly!
[08:31] <AWOSLappy> cge okay
[08:32] <nevermind> Lam_: looks like you don't have a /dev/hdc
[08:32] <AWOSLappy> dusk, killall -9 firefox-bin
[08:32] <rickyfingers> lam: prolly ur dvd is not /dev/hdc
[08:32] <cge> AWOSLappy: So my guess is that the problem is with your computer, not with the card.
[08:32] <luminousnerd> CarinArr: gunzip: UT2004-LNX-Demo3334.run.gz: unexpected end of file
[08:32] <shrndegruv> can anyone help me get my laptop to hibernate when the lid is closed?
[08:32] <cge> AWOSLappy: Incidentally, does anything show up in syslog when you plug the new card into your old laptop?
[08:32] <dusk> AWOSLappy: kill: illegal pid: firefox-bin
[08:32] <AWOSLappy> cge, is there like a test PCMCIA card that I could buy or something?  or a really cheap one?
[08:32] <AWOSLappy> cge, I have FreeBSD on that one
[08:32] <Lam_> nevermind: how can i find out what my dvd drive is so i can ln -s it correct to /dev/dvd?
[08:32] <AWOSLappy> cge, not Linux
[08:32] <nevermind> dusk: try sudo killall firefox
[08:32] <nevermind> w/o the '-9'
[08:33] <cge> AWOSLappy: Ah yes, I forgot.
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> dusk, killALL
[08:33] <rickyfingers> dusk: ps -ef | grep firefox
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> dusk, so do    killall -9 firefox-bin
[08:33] <dusk> nevermind: worked.. but now I get a stupid window
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> dusk haha
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> cge oh
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> cge but it does in FreeBSD.
[08:33] <rickyfingers> dusk: then sudo kill -s 9 pid from grep
[08:33] <AWOSLappy> cge, can you stay here for like an hour?
[08:34] <nevermind> guys, what was the command to see our disks? xD
[08:34] <Doow> How can I see the reason that updates are being held back? (got 28 python-* packages that won't upgrade)
[08:34] <rickyfingers> nevermind just type mount
[08:34] <bony> well i think no one is interested in my problem. i will wait!
[08:34] <nevermind> lol
[08:34] <rickyfingers> that'll show you if the disk is already mounted
[08:34] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, df -h ?
[08:34] <rickyfingers> if it didn't automount, do dmesg | less
[08:34] <AWOSLappy> cge?
[08:35] <luminousnerd> Any ideas on my bad UT2k4?
[08:35] <rickyfingers> nevermind: that'll show you what's detected at boot time
[08:35] <AWOSLappy> luminousnerd redownload then come back if that doesn't work.  make sure you REMOVE the old one before redownloading
[08:35] <nevermind> Lam_: try using mount or df -h to see what is your dvd drive
[08:35] <haxality> hey..
[08:35] <luminousnerd> AWOSLappy: well, I already did once but I'll try once more
[08:35] <haxality> are there any programs that would allow me to view a list of wireless APs and choose one to connect to?
[08:35] <AWOSLappy> luminousnerd great thanks :)
[08:35] <nevermind> well, that'll work if the drive was recognised and mounted xD
[08:35] <AWOSLappy> cge!?
[08:36] <now> hi

[08:37] <rickyfingers> haxality: not every wnic supports iwlist though
[08:37] <now> because i can't connect with wlan but lan ok
[08:37] <AWOSLappy> now, I can't help you with that, as my own WiFi is broke and that is why I am here.
[08:37] <nevermind> why everyone has wifi? and why everyone that ahs wifi uses ubuntu? xD
[08:37] <now> ok no problem thank you
[08:38] <AWOSLappy> nevermind hahaha
[08:38] <rawrness> I am to poor for wifi :P

[08:40] <nevermind> rawrness: i wonder if he gets PPV on the TV with that
[08:40] <now> how can i do an ifconfig/iwconfig?
[08:40] <CarinArr> now, er heh. you first type ifconfig in terminal, then iwconfig
[08:40] <rawrness> He gets insane bandwidth though.
[08:41] <now> ok
[08:41] <AWOSLappy> Fastly, oops
[08:41] <homeqwerty> I am looking for a software to run on ubuntu that is similar to MythTV. I need a PVR solution that i can minimize so i can still use the computer for my daily activities. Any ideas? (Does MythTV minimize to the tray?)
[08:41] <CarinArr> what sort of problems are people having with their wifi cards by the way
[08:41] <madc> CarinArr, mainly WPA.
[08:41] <Fastly> AWOSLappy: yeah, please forget that
[08:41] <CarinArr> madc, ah, don't use wpa so i'm okay
[08:41] <madc> homeqwerty, mythtv can run completely as a background service
[08:41] <cge> AWOSLappy: Sorry, my computer decided to freeze.
[08:41] <tritium> homeqwerty: you can run mythtv in a window
[08:41] <AWOSLappy> Fastly, sorry it has been logged :)
[08:41] <AWOSLappy> cge ooh sorry
[08:41] <tritium> (the frontend)
[08:41] <cge> AWOSLappy: Running feisty has its disadvantages.
[08:41] <nevermind> Fastly: allways identify yourself on the server tab :P not in the channel
[08:41] <d00d> Hi. If I get umount: /media/sda3: device is busy when unmounting, how do I find out what is using /media/sda3?
[08:41] <AWOSLappy> cge, all you missed was Fastly gave out his password to everybody
[08:42] <Fastly> AWOSLappy: no problem, i've got registry magician
[08:42] <AWOSLappy> Fastly hahahahahaha
[08:42] <homeqwerty> (^_^) YAY!     THANK YOU for the quick answer!

[08:43] <cge> AWOSLappy: Probably not, sorry.
[08:43] <CarinArr> now, can you paste what it says in
[08:43] <CarinArr> !pastebin | now
[08:43] <ubotu> now: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:43] <AWOSLappy> cge, how long?
[08:43] <rawrness> I wonder if it would stay stable that long.
[08:43] <Fastly> AWOSLappy: i'll give you a torrent for registry magician, it will fix your computer so that it works good.
[08:43] <cge> AWOSLappy: probably around 20 minutes
[08:43] <nevermind> d00d: well, what is the sda3? an usb storage device?
[08:43] <AWOSLappy> hmm.
[08:43] <now> i don't understand english very well i'm french sorry
[08:43] <d00d> nevermind: A hard drive partition.
[08:43] <CarinArr> sda is sata
[08:43] <homeqwerty> I can not find MythTV in Synaptic... What do i do?
[08:43] <AWOSLappy> cge, hmm.  my challenge is to install Linux on my 1996 laptop in 20 minutes
[08:43] <AWOSLappy> !fr | now

[08:43] <rawrness> Fun
[08:43] <cge> AWOSLappy: You could try a LiveCD?
[08:43] <Fastly> trust, the magician knows what he's doing....
[08:43] <madc> homeqwerty, goto the mythtv page, they have a deb package you can install.
[08:43] <d00d> I just want to unmount it, but it won't let me.
[08:44] <AWOSLappy> cge, can't boot off of CD :P
[08:44] <homeqwerty> madc, thanks
[08:44] <now> thanks awosl
[08:44] <CarinArr> awoslappy, it will take longer than that to copy the files
[08:44] <cge> AWOSLappy: with a boot floppy?
[08:44] <AWOSLappy> cge, ah okay
[08:44] <now> #ubuntu-fr
[08:44] <CarinArr> awoslappy, unless you're planning on a really really really light version;)
[08:44] <cge> AWOSLappy: Or you could use tomsrbt or something similar, but that won't give an accurate view of what the hardware support is like.
[08:44] <AWOSLappy> CarinArr hahahahahahahaha
[08:44] <now> join # ubuntu-fr
[08:44] <Fastly> just install him on an administrator account and he will sort out all of your computer problems (including cleaning unwanted shotcuts off the desktop)
[08:44] <h1v> What's the difference between the server and desktop ISO's besides server not installing gui?
[08:44] <nevermind> d00d: have you tried with -f
[08:44] <CarinArr> now, /join #ubuntu-fr
[08:45] <now> ok ^
[08:45] <nevermind> h1v: the networking packages
[08:45] <d00d> nevermind: Nope, will try. Thanks. :-)
[08:45] <now> thank Carinarr
[08:45] <AWOSLappy> cge, where do I get the besgatgd
[08:45] <nathansnook7> Is there a way to kill zombie processes?
[08:45] <AWOSLappy> oops
[08:45] <AWOSLappy> cge, where do I get the floppy images?
[08:45] <Fastly> it's all about registry magician now guys
[08:45] <Fastly> we were wrong all along
[08:46] <cge> Fastly: Is this some new #ubuntu joke I haven't heard about?
[08:46] <Fastly> the magician will set your registry free
[08:46] <AWOSLappy> cge, no he made this program.
[08:46] <AWOSLappy> cge, it supposedly fixes Windows registries
[08:46] <nevermind> AWOSLappy: what is it for?
[08:46] <Fastly> yes, i can give you a trial version
[08:46] <nevermind> lol, nvm
[08:46] <nevermind> i know hoy to fix w$ registry for free
[08:46] <CarinArr> i know someone who "fixes" his windows registry by randomly deleting keys from it
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> nathansnook7, well a zombie is someone that is dead.  so, um, you can't kill zombies :)
[08:47] <madc> thats the fun way
[08:47] <cge> AWOSLappy: I'm rather certain that Ubuntu's live CDs don't have a boot floppy. I think you could use a generic grub floppy though.
[08:47] <nevermind> it's a simple dos command
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> cge I have GRUB floppy!
[08:47] <Fastly> it looks at your registry and then the magican sweeps up all of the computer gremlins that make booting up really slow
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, deltree c:\windows?
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, format c: ?
[08:47] <cge> AWOSLappy: I used to carry one with me everywhere I went.
[08:47] <nevermind> AWOSLappy: the second one
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> cge, now what is the boot line?
[08:47] <madc> use your livecd to fix windows ;P
[08:47] <AWOSLappy> nevermind ah okay :)
[08:47] <nevermind> deltree is deprecated
[08:47] <Fastly> never leave home with registry magician
[08:48] <nathansnook7> AWOSLappy:  I have python and netstat that are currently in zombie state
[08:48] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, really!?
[08:48] <cge> AWOSLappy: I'm not sure. You will probably have to figure that out yourself, unfortunately.
[08:48] <CarinArr> i still have windows installed for photoshop/painter/macromedia suite
[08:48] <bony> j/ #cvs
[08:48] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, they CAN'T remove deltree.  that is so messed up..
[08:48] <CarinArr> if they could all port their software i'd be very .. pleased.
[08:48] <cge> Fastly: Does it delete everything if you go outside your house or something?
[08:48] <nevermind> AWOSLappy: i never saw it on Wxp
[08:48] <madc> CarinArr, macromedia suite works in wine but I give it a B- for speed.
[08:48] <haxality> ok, I found a program and installed it
[08:48] <haxality> but.. how do I use 'network-manager'
[08:48] <nevermind> AWOSLappy: i have it on a 3.12 disk
[08:48] <Fastly> no, but it synchronises my cat with my zune
[08:48] <AWOSLappy> nevermind, it was there
[08:49] <Trixsey> Something odd I've noticed in both windows and ubuntu; why can't I do a printscreen of a desktop with a movie running?
[08:49] <Trixsey> The movie becomes all black
[08:49] <CarinArr> madc, my laptop already has a B- for a speed, so it would be B- squared;)
[08:49] <AWOSLappy> I can't use GRUB floppy :-(
[08:49] <Fastly> however the kitty would need an implant...
[08:49] <cge> Trixsey: I believe that is intentional in Windows, but not in X.
[08:49] <nevermind> Trixsey: becasue the movie is played in an overlayer
[08:49] <madc> Trixsey, on windows its a directdraw issue, linux should be fine.
[08:49] <AWOSLappy> how do I even install this freaky thing?
[08:50] <cge> AWOSLappy: What do you mean?
[08:50] <madc> I've taken screenshots using gnomes screenshot tool with video running + xgl actualy.
[08:50] <Trixsey> madc: it doesn't work for me anyway, in either OS
[08:50] <nevermind> right, linux should be fine capturing videos
[08:50] <Fastly> AWOSLappy: why are you using a floppy? you're soo last millenium
[08:51] <madc> Trixsey, interesting, if _should_ , I remember seeing something about xine and X and screenshots, what are you using to play movies?
[08:51] <nevermind> Trixsey: in that case, check upon your video output device
[08:51] <dream> Any one run ubuntu on raid 1 hardware
[08:51] <madc> dream, sure
[08:51] <cge> AWOSLappy: I think it should be something like boot (hd1,0), then kernel vmlinuz ..., but I don't know what the options would be. Let me look at something.
[08:51] <CarinArr> weird.. my terminals are lagging horrendously today
[08:52] <nevermind> AWOSLappy: floppys rules!
[08:52] <dream> madc why when i do raid 1 and instaling ubuntu on disk instalasion still there 2 hard disk
[08:52] <haxality> hello?
[08:52] <haxality> anyone?
[08:52] <nevermind> we're here haxality
[08:52] <madc> dream, is this hardware raid? through a raid card of sorts? and have you created a logical volume ?
[08:52] <nevermind> but i've never used that program
[08:53] <dream> yes hardware madc
[08:53] <cge> AWOSLappy: Ok, isolinux.cfg, at least for the edgy livecd, would use kernel /casper/vmlinuz  boot=casper integrity-check initrd=/casper/initrd.gz ramdisk_size=1048576 root=/dev/ram rw quiet splash --
[08:53] <Fastly> i wonder how many floppys Windows Vista would take up? anyone hazard a guess?
=== deesine is now known as dee|away
[08:53] <AWOSLappy> cge, really?
[08:53] <dream> no still not
[08:53] <AWOSLappy> wow!
[08:53] <dream> i dont created any logical colume
[08:53] <cge> AWOSLappy: Err, I mean GRUB would use that. I took it from isolinux.cfg
[08:53] <madc> dream, did you create a logical volume? and set it active, most raid is OS independant so the OS only sees what the raid volumes are set to
[08:53] <AWOSLappy> Fastly, it requires a DVD, so appx 4700000 floppies :P
[08:53] <nevermind> Fastly: well, it askes you for 15GB of free diskspace, so....
[08:53] <AWOSLappy> cge coooooooooooooolness!
[08:53] <CarinArr> fastly, well.. what's mor edisturbing is thinking how long it would take to read them all
[08:54] <AWOSLappy> CarinArr hahahahaha
[08:54] <madc> windows 95 3.5" floppies ftw!
[08:54] <noiesmo> hey all just upgrade dappper to edgy and having a problem with starting x the error is loading keymap /var/lib/xkb/server-0.km
[08:54] <dream> he ask me to have 2 hard disk
[08:54] <dream> know
[08:54] <nevermind> CarinArr: even more disturbing would be an error on the disk 469999 at the end point of the installation
[08:54] <madc> dream, english isnt your native tongue is it?
[08:54] <dream> when i do riad only 1 becouse mirror 1
[08:54] <cge> AWOSLappy: though you probably want to remove the quiet and splash options so that you can see what is going on.
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> madc yeah!  30 disks!  I've done it literally hundres of time!
[08:55] <haxality> well, does anyone here use gnome network manager?
[08:55] <CarinArr> nevermind, heh, yeah.. bugger;)
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> cge, yeah
[08:55] <haxality> I can't figure out how to start it
[08:55] <Fastly> so.... i'm probably going to kill my trust drive during the upgrade procedure... maybe i should wait until blue-ray takes off
[08:55] <madc> AWOSLappy, I lost count of the times I did it
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> nevermind hahaha
[08:55] <madc> Ive got w2k keys in my brain for life
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> madc haha
[08:55] <cge> nevermind: I hated when floppies did that! I remember trying to make a GRUB floppy and going through 20 floppies before finding one that would work.
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> madc, what are they?  :P
[08:55] <madc> hehe
[08:55] <dream> cge give me two second i do from my lep top know
[08:55] <dream> new nick i coant from the othere site
[08:55] <Fastly> WQ0PX-AFNKF-AJW09-SU9WF-FAJJW
[08:55] <CarinArr> i felt slightly stupid a few weeks ago when i went to make a floppy boot disk and realised i had nowhere to put it because i never bought a floppy drive for my new pc
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> Fastly, serious
[08:55] <AWOSLappy> ?
[08:56] <nevermind> Error reading disk in drive A: INT 24
[08:56] <madc> hehe
[08:56] <Fastly> NO
[08:56] <nevermind> that's why i use live cds
[08:56] <madc> Ive seen someone "guess" a key for xp home
[08:56] <madc> and it worked
[08:56] <AWOSLappy> cge, yeah
[08:56] <AWOSLappy> madc hahahaha
[08:56] <cge> nevermind: And trying to make 1.7MiB floppies was even worse.
[08:56] <madc> weather or not they memorized one prior
[08:56] <AWOSLappy> madc, well what's frustrating is I lost my Visio key
[08:56] <Fastly> no way
[08:56] <nevermind> cge: wtf?
[08:56] <AWOSLappy> madc, and M$ won't give me a new one no matter how many times I tell them I am legit.
[08:57] <AWOSLappy> cge hahaha yeah DMF
[08:57] <madc> theyre bastards about that, go get a msdn account ;p
[08:57] <AWOSLappy> madc, that's where I GOT Visio
[08:57] <madc> at least then you can get visio standalone
[08:57] <bhudda> Ah, MSDN, I love that thing.
[08:57] <madc> ohhh!
[08:57] <cge> nevermind: There was some way to stuff 1.7MiB of stuff onto a 1.4MiB floppy in Linux, but it didn't work unless the disk was in rather pristine condition.
[08:57] <madc> I think we pay ~1600us a year and we get every lil piece of software MS makes through msdn
[08:58] <AWOSLappy> madc yep
[08:58] <nevermind> well, that's comething that would come in handy about... say... 7 yrs ago
[08:58] <madc> its worth it for integrators/admins for sure.
[08:58] <AWOSLappy> cge yep
[08:58] <cge> nevermind: mulinux used them
[08:58] <madc> have a zip drive?
[08:58] <madc> you could always use that
[08:58] <AWOSLappy> madc yeah, I got it for $13 off of eBay, it was verrrry old from 1997 so they thought it wasn't valid, I activated it and got a year :)
[08:58] <AWOSLappy> madc, yeah!  ZIP100 drive FTW!
[08:58] <madc> well AWOSLappy I think you got your moneys worth ;P
[08:59] <AWOSLappy> madc for sure :)
[08:59] <_pvh_> hi! i'm trying to upgrade a dapper system to edgy... but i got a clash between the xrgb and x11-common packages
[08:59] <_pvh_> both of 'em claim ownership of /etc/X11/rgb.txt
[08:59] <Fastly> yeah, these guys are pretty hardcore... they hang around on #ubuntu guessing XP keys until they have the magic key that unlocks Vista Ultimate with Direct X 10 and Halo 3 and erm... all the other cool stuff that you didn't know that you didn't wanted too, but were going to sell it to you anyway because your computer/laptop is rubbish and can't handle our aero fx with flip 3d animation...
[08:59] <CarinArr> talking about weird things you can do with linux, and continuing on the offtopic, i was told the other day that my old ibm laptop has motion sensor for turning harddrives and stuff off in case you drop it.. and you can fiddle with the kernel in linux and make it sense commands, like slapping your computer can restart x or whatever
[08:59] <madc> _pvh_, thats a pretty common error covered in the forums.
[08:59] <_pvh_> any ideas? i don't know why it thinks it needs both
[08:59] <checkmate> how do you change the default sound card in ubuntu? i have onboard and a PCI card, i currently don't have the mixer i was using with my PCI card so i need to use the onboard, but even if i change the default in the "System->Preferences->Sound" window, it resets to the PCI when i boot... is there a file i can edit to keep it on a set default?
[08:59] <_pvh_> it is? googling didn't find stuff
[09:00] <madc> CarinArr, most laptops have those
[09:00] <nevermind> checkmate: the best way would be to disable the onboard one from the bios
[09:00] <madc> theyve been playing with osx and macbooks lately to nudge it to swap workspaces
[09:00] <checkmate> nevermind: it's the opposite, i need to set it to the onboard
[09:01] <checkmate> instead of the PCI
[09:01] <AWOSLappy> CarinArr hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[09:01] <madc> I think a slap should cause a instant forkbomb
[09:01] <nevermind> then just remove the pci one ;)
[09:01] <CarinArr> madc, i was told the ibm's only had the particular kind where it works up til 2003
[09:01] <nevermind> lol
=== Janchi is now known as JanS
[09:01] <CarinArr> madc, i should add a disclaimer that i personally have no idea about it, just made me laugh
=== JanS is now known as Janchi
[09:01] <nevermind> checkmate: it's weird that it doesn't remeber your setting
[09:01] <checkmate> yeah but that seems like a redundant solution for the problem... why doesn't ubuntu save the settings?
[09:01] <AWOSLappy> madc haha
[09:01] <checkmate> yeah it drives me nuts
[09:01] <madc> CarinArr, thats totally possible, I just know most modern ones have it, weather or not its and acpi object or not...
[09:01] <CarinArr> play whatever that super monkey ball clone is called by tipping your laptop back and forth
[09:02] <checkmate> i get the bootup sound if i ctrl-alt-backspace, but i can't run certain programs with sound because they're trying to use the PCI card
[09:02] <AWOSLappy> CarinArr hehe
[09:02] <nevermind> checkmate: nothing comes up in my mind, sry
[09:02] <checkmate> sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it's bizarre
[09:02] <madc> someone will make a web2 app out of turn your laptop into a 1500$ level for hanging shelves.
[09:02] <linuxd> hi cgi i am drembox nick right know i am select a disk
[09:02] <nevermind> checkmate: disabling the pci card, mayb?
[09:02] <linuxd> and i have 2 disk but my box is riad 1
[09:03] <CarinArr> madc, heh.. well it's worth it for the "wow.. that's really strange" factor

[09:04] <cge> Err, linuxd, is there some reason why you are asking me in particular? I tend to get rather confused when talking to so many people here - was I talking to you earlier?
[09:04] <linuxd> cge can you help me in raid 1
[09:05] <_pvh_> ah, found it. force overwrite with dpkg
[09:05] <cge> linuxd: Not really, I've never used RAID before. But I would imagine that someone else here has.
[09:05] <linuxd> cge why i have 2 drives in select a disk ubuntu

[09:13] <mdke_> is there a way to get thunderbird to check all my imap folders for mail? At the moment it only checks the folder I'm in, which is a pain
[09:13] <nevermind> linuxd: check this out: http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html
[09:14] <nevermind> it's pretty intuitive
[09:15] <Jared777u> .
[09:15] <nevermind> mdke_: yes
[09:16] <nevermind> mdke_: just add "user_pref("mail.check_all_imap_folders_for_new", true);" to your user.js file
[09:16] <mdke_> gah
[09:16] <Jared777u> I lost power during boot up now it fails to load the GUI and says it is missing Nvidia.ko.  HOw do I corrct this?
[09:16] <mdke_> nevermind: ok thanks.
[09:16] <nevermind> Jared777u: reinstall the nvidia kernel
[09:17] <Sjaakmans> Hello
[09:17] <Cas> does anyone knows in what package intltoolize resist?
[09:17] <Doow> since upgrading to Edgy my /etc/fstab calls the partitions stuff like UUID=6B8FEF714EDDEB9E instead of /dev/hdd2. Is this something I should stick to when adding new partitions, and if so, how do I know what UUID to use?
[09:17] <mdke_> nevermind: that works :) Thanks! I can't believe the solution is so ugly though.
[09:17] <Jared777u> what is the command for that?  I tried apt-get install nvidia-glx nothing
[09:18] <nevermind> mdke_: i don't use thunderbird though
[09:18] <nevermind> Jared777u: i think it was modprobe, but quite not sure
[09:19] <Jared777u> Hmm no clue how to do that still very new to using linux when it comes to the terminal
[09:19] <nevermind> you can try the 'envy' script tho, or just use the binary install
[09:19] <nevermind> !envy
[09:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about envy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:19] <nevermind> lol, sec
[09:20] <nevermind> Jared777u: albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html you can try that
[09:20] <nevermind> worked with me
[09:20] <nevermind> and gave me lastest nvidia driver ^
[09:21] <Jared777u> how do I do that if I only have access to the console? it wants me to download the scripts from the page
[09:21] <Doow> Jared777u: you can use wget or links
[09:22] <nevermind> Jared777u: as a workaround, you ca just use the defualt 'nv' driver on your xorg.conf to get to the gui
[09:22] <Doow> or do what nevermind said =)
[09:23] <nevermind> Doow: i still man everything lol xD
[09:23] <Doow> nevermind: =)

[09:26] <nevermind> SpriteSODA: yes, you can, do you know what version do you have?
[09:26] <SpriteSODA> mmm
[09:26] <SpriteSODA> not older than 6 months
[09:26] <nevermind> wraithsoul: i'll need to look into it, never changed my panels yet
[09:26] <Doow> SpriteSODA: yes, but I believe that upgrading to Edgy has broken ubuntu for some people, so if you can get hold of Edgy (6.10) it might be safe
[09:26] <wraithsoul> also, if I have desktop icons, how do I get the names under them to go away?
[09:26] <Doow> SpriteSODA: upgrading worked well for me though, so don't be afraid to try it
[09:26] <wraithsoul> I ended up learning alot because mine broke.
[09:27] <SpriteSODA> thanks guys=] 
[09:27] <wraithsoul> I can log in graphically as root ^.^
[09:27] <Doow> wraithsoul: haha =)
[09:27] <nevermind> SpriteSODA: by the way, it's sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, not just update
[09:27] <wraithsoul> It was crazy, basically only root can use some of the resources I needed.
[09:27] <Jared777u> how do i get the original nv driver back?
[09:27] <SpriteSODA> ok
[09:28] <nevermind> Jared777u: on the terminal, just write: sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:28] <Doow> SpriteSODA: and you have to change your /etc/apt/sources.list, but install the version you have first and we can tell you about that later
[09:28] <SpriteSODA> ok i will be back in an half hour time i hope =] 
[09:28] <nevermind> Jared777u: find where it says 'nvidia' and change it to 'nv'
[09:28] <Doow> SpriteSODA: good luck =)
[09:28] <SpriteSODA> thx
[09:28] <nevermind> then, to save hit ':' and write 'save /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[09:29] <nevermind> and once again ':' and 'q' for quit
[09:29] <nevermind> and then, just sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
[09:29] <wraithsoul> also, how do I change my dist-icon?
[09:31] <Jared777u> okay rebooting
[09:31] <nevermind> Jared777u: that was fast
[09:31] <zero-1> have anyone owrked with pando under ubunut?
[09:31] <zero-1> worked
[09:31] <nevermind> wraithsoul: sry, it's too much for me, i'm already asleepy
[09:31] <nevermind> zero-1: what is pando?
[09:32] <nevermind> !pando
[09:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pando - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:32] <zero-1> P2P app like Frostwire
[09:32] <Doow> wraithsoul: you might have better luck #gnome at GIMPNet
[09:32] <Jared777u> wohoo I can see.. now to get the beta driver so I can get Beryl going again
[09:32] <ucordes> gtk-gnutella is great for p2p
[09:32] <_pvh_> ok, anyone seen this with edgy - initramfs-tools package seems broken... get "sed: can't read -" when unpacking
[09:32] <nevermind> i c, well... nop, i still use arse
[09:32] <_pvh_> and i don't see anything about this in forums
[09:33] <zero-1> yeah the thing is that it works like bittorrent and I got the files but i don have pando :(
[09:33] <nevermind> Jared777u: if you want beryl, use the envy script to get the latest nvidia driver
[09:33] <zero-1> I didnt know what pando was either :p i just found out today
[09:34] <bhudda> where is xfwm4 located?
[09:34] <mario> hola

[09:39] <see> thnx
[09:39] <see> ill try it out
[09:39] <TheMoebius> something is taking all my CPU as top says 51%us  49%sy, but none of the processes in the list are taking more than 8% so how can i find out whats using it all?
[09:40] <defrysk> TheMoebius, top
[09:40] <Doow> TheMoebius: doesn't top tell you what is using your cpu?
[09:41] <mdious> yeah it does...it should list what is taking it all up
[09:41] <nevermind> must be windows taking revenge
[09:41] <Axsuul> how do you disable emerald in beryl?
[09:41] <wraithsoul> back
[09:41] <nevermind> Axsuul: just do sudo apt-get remove emerald emerald-themes
[09:41] <Doow> mdious: I know it usually does, but he says he's using top in the same sentence as he's asking
=== zarul is now known as zarul[afk] 
[09:41] <TheMoebius> nope, it says the CPU is being used in the top summary area but the processes in the list only account for about 15%
[09:41] <wraithsoul> What is the command for the menu?
[09:42] <TheMoebius> even when i run top as root
=== zarul[afk]  is now known as zarul[busy] 
[09:42] <mdious> Doow>i know i'm just in a chatty mood....:(
[09:42] <Axsuul> nevermind: but that also removes beryl
[09:42] <mdious> can you post the output of top?
[09:42] <Doow> mdious: don't be sad =)
[09:42] <ucordes> what is the most up to date repo for beryl?
[09:42] <nevermind> Axsuul: no it doesn't, they're independant
[09:42] <TheMoebius> mdious: sure, where should i post it to?
[09:42] <nevermind> ucordes: quinns's
[09:42] <see> btw anybody here uses ubuntu on a macpro, and has been able to get sound working?
[09:43] <mdious> could you post it in here...or just the top of it lol

[09:43] <linuxd> any wheb site where can dawnlod linux
[09:43] <wraithsoul> What is the command for the menu?
[09:43] <nevermind> ucordes: here's a mirror, deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main-edgy
[09:44] <nevermind> wraithsoul: what menu?
[09:44] <yango> is there a beagle interface for gnome?
[09:44] <wraithsoul> the one people click to open up the menu with the little ubuntu icon.
[09:44] <nevermind> linuxd: linuxiso.org
[09:44] <wraithsoul> has things like applications, places, system, etc.
[09:44] <TheMoebius> mdious: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32287/
[09:44] <ucordes> nevermind: deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ dapper main-dapper    for dapper?
[09:45] <niru> hello all
[09:45] <Axsuul> `nevermind: it says the the following packages will be removed , beryl beryl-manager emerald emerald-themes
[09:45] <niru> I am creating a live cd as the way ubuntu created
[09:45] <nevermind> wraithsoul: you mean to make that show up>
[09:45] <wraithsoul> yeah
[09:45] <niru> But unable to get the image
[09:45] <nevermind> ucordes: yup
[09:45] <wraithsoul> with a command.
[09:45] <nevermind> Axsuul: are you using apt-get or aptitude?
[09:45] <niru> make-live command I used
[09:45] <niru> But I am unable to connect to my local repo
[09:46] <niru> when connected to debian repo it works
[09:46] <TheMoebius> mdious: the cpu usage of firefox jumped when i copied it but it usually idles at around 47%us, 48%sy
[09:46] <TheMoebius> mdious: and my fan is going like crazy so my CPU must be working hard
[09:46] <Axsuul> nevermind: apt-get
[09:46] <nevermind> Axsuul: i'll recommend to remove everything and install just beryl again
[09:47] <nevermind> don't know why it has those dependencies, since it shouldn't
[09:47] <XiXaQ> TheMoebius, 47%?!
[09:47] <mdious> TheMoebuis>maybe it is hardware fault or something...i don't know, sorry i'm incompetent and can't help you at all
[09:48] <nevermind> Axsuul: anywho, why do you want to remove emerald?
[09:48] <mdious> sorry for leading you on as if i could perhaps help ;)
[09:48] <MikeyMike> is there a terminal command that will show what version of ubuntu someone is using
[09:48] <TheMoebius> XiXaQ: yeah there is something very wrong, but the tasks in top don't add up
[09:48] <MikeyMike> something similar to uname -r
[09:48] <TheMoebius> XiXaQ: see my paste from top http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32287/
[09:48] <Jared777u> rebooting let see if she works
[09:48] <Axsuul> nevermind: i want to use an ubuntu theme
[09:48] <mdious> MikeyMike>cat /etc/issue
[09:48] <MikeyMike> thank you
[09:48] <Axsuul> nevermind; but with emerald it seems to conflict
[09:49] <mdious> try it out first....
[09:49] <mdious> muz@muznet:~$ cat /etc/issue
[09:49] <mdious> Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS \n \l
[09:49] <MikeyMike> is that the only way ?
[09:49] <nevermind> Axsuul: if you remove emerald, you'll end up with no window borders nor decorations
[09:49] <MikeyMike> by catting the issue?
[09:49] <Piquant77> hey I need help with a webcam on Edgy Eft. I have a nexxtech mini digital camera and when i launch camorama it says "Could not connect to video device (/dev/video0). Please check connection" In my system /dev/video0 doesn't exist. What can I do?
[09:49] <nevermind> metacity themes don't work with beryl
[09:49] <mdious> /etc/issue was a nice surprise for me...i remember when someone first showed me :)
[09:49] <MikeyMike> its not bad
[09:49] <MikeyMike> is there any other way?
[09:50] <Geoffrey2> can anyone recommend a decent PCMCIA TV tuner card that will work with Ubuntu?
[09:50] <Axsuul> nevermind; so in order to use ubuntu themes, i have to uninstall beryl?
[09:50] <Jared777u> nevermind: works sorta back in after running envy script but now Beryl won't load
[09:51] <nevermind> Axsuul: no, you just use metacity as the window manager, but you won't have beryl's 3d
[09:51] <XiXaQ> TheMoebius, strange. What kind of cpu do you have?
[09:51] <mdious> MikeyMike>not that i know of...you can find details such as Linux muznet 2.6.15-27-386 #1 PREEMPT Sat Sep 16 01:51:59 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[09:51] <mdious>  with uname but that isn't really what you are asking for....
[09:51] <nevermind> Jared777u: are you using xgl or aiglx?
[09:51] <MikeyMike> mdious, right
[09:51] <MikeyMike> ok thanks anyway
[09:51] <mdious> MikeyMike>did cat /etc/issue work?
[09:51] <MikeyMike> /etc/issue will suffice
[09:51] <Jared777u> aiglx
[09:51] <MikeyMike> yeah it did
[09:52] <MikeyMike> Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS \n \l
[09:52] <mdious> ah okay...hope it helps out a bit
[09:52] <MikeyMike> see :)
[09:52] <nevermind> !webcam
[09:52] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[09:52] <mdious> :)
[09:52] <Axsuul> nevermind: so theres way i can use beryl with the default theme manager?
[09:52] <Axsuul> theres no way*
[09:52] <defrysk> qno way indeed
[09:52] <nevermind> Piquant77: that's for you
[09:52] <nevermind> Axsuul: nop, sry
[09:53] <TheMoebius> XiXaQ: its a pentium 4 i think, inspiron 8200. I'm booted on the live cd atm
[09:53] <Axsuul> what does compiz do exactly in a xgl environment?
[09:53] <nevermind> Axsuul: but anywho, there's a emerald theme that's almost the same as the metacity on
[09:53] <Axsuul> nevermind: ah
[09:54] <mdious> as you could tell i'm new to irc...what client is everyone using?  I'm currently just using xchat...anyone know of something much better?
[09:54] <ucordes> nevermind: "deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ dapper main-dapper" does not work :-(
[09:54] <nevermind> Axsuul: compiz is the composite manager, basically, is the one that decides the window's transformations to be applied before showing them up in the xgl scren
[09:54] <Axsuul> nevermind: ah ok, and beryl has both compiz and xgl?
[09:54] <nevermind> ucordes: do you need for dapper or edgy's?
[09:55] <nevermind> Axsuul: beryl is a compiz fork, the're now two different projects
[09:55] <GirlRiver> Can someone please tell me how I can get centralised password administration on my home Edgy network ?
[09:55] <Axsuul> nevermind; i see, thanks
[09:55] <Axsuul> nevermind: do you know the de facto website for emerald themes?
[09:55] <nevermind> Axsuul: compiz is mantained by novell, beryl by the community
[09:55] <defrysk> novell is maintained by microsoft now :s
[09:55] <nevermind> beryl.project.org
[09:55] <Axsuul> thanks
[09:56] <nevermind> sry, it's beryl-project.org
[09:56] <nevermind> Axsuul: yo can also search on devianart or pages like that
[09:56] <ucordes> nevermind: dapper
[09:56] <mdious> speaking of microsoft and linux, I know it's old news but I always found port 25 a good laugh...
[09:58] <ucordes> defrysk: what you mean by novell is maintained by ms?
[09:58] <nevermind> ucordes: try this one instead
[09:58] <nevermind> http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz
[09:58] <defrysk> ucordes, ot sorry go google
[09:58] <we2by> should I defrag my hd if ubuntu gone slow?
[09:59] <nevermind> deb http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz dapper main-dapper
[09:59] <GirlRiver> Can anyone help me to get PAM or similar going on Edgy ?
[09:59] <nevermind> we2by: ext3 filesystem doesn't need defrag
[09:59] <we2by> oh ok
[09:59] <defrysk> ucordes, http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/
[10:00] <ucordes> defrysk: omfg

[10:01] <ucordes> defrysk: *puke
[10:01] <defrysk> you guys did not know ?
[10:01] <ucordes> no
[10:01] <nevermind> didn't know that
[10:01] <ucordes> i can't believe it
[10:01] <ucordes> it's such a pita
[10:01] <defrysk> whell wake up then
[10:01] <ucordes> the beginning of the end
[10:01] <nevermind> oh, now that you mention, i've heard about it before
[10:01] <nevermind> long time ago tho
[10:01] <defrysk> anyway , its ot read the latest ubuntu newsletter
[10:02] <nevermind> ucordes: of microsoft xD
[10:02] <ucordes> well i don't give a damn about suse
[10:02] <LLcoolM> installing the sun jdk requires " You must accept Sun's EULA prior to successfully installing this package".
[10:02] <LLcoolM> how can i do that?
[10:02] <defrysk> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/10/shuttleworth_oracle/
[10:03] <nevermind> LLcoolM: by hitting the "I Agree" button
[10:03] <nevermind> lol
[10:03] <mdious> last time i checked out suse it was horribly bloated...yuck
[10:03] <LLcoolM> nevermind: a, that will get displayed?
[10:03] <nevermind> yup
[10:03] <LLcoolM> or will i have to set something like with netbsd (you need to specify the licences you accept in a file there)
[10:03] <defrysk> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue21
[10:03] <mdious> and all the mono crap...i really don't want anything .net related running on any of my systems
[10:04] <GirlRiver> Does anyone know how to centrally manage passwords on a Linux network ?
[10:04] <wraithsoul> back
[10:04] <nevermind> LLcoolM: sun is not so good  i'll give you a whole license that you want to read and accept
[10:04] <mdious> GirlRiver>how are you authenticating clients?
[10:04] <wraithsoul> does anyone know the command to open the main menu yet? :P
[10:04] <mdious> wraithsoul>can't you just make up your own shortcut to open the menu lol
[10:05] <defrysk> nevermind, sun java is opensourced
[10:05] <defrysk> its open now
[10:05] <defrysk> free now
[10:05] <wraithsoul> I want it to not be stuck on the top layer.
[10:05] <wraithsoul> so I am using gDesklets
[10:05] <nevermind> defrysk: ok, then i'm older than win3.1
[10:06] <wraithsoul> hehe
[10:06] <defrysk> nevermind, http://java.sun.com/
[10:06] <nevermind> ok, it's 6am here i'm going to sleep
[10:06] <wraithsoul> well, I may go to bed. if I cannot solve the issue in a few minutes I do not want to stay up.
[10:06] <wraithsoul> sweet dreams nevermind.
[10:07] <nevermind> wraithsoul: ty
[10:07] <nevermind> see ya guys, nice talking to ya
[10:07] <defrysk> nevermind, you seem to need sleep yes ;)
[10:07] <defrysk> nn
[10:07] <nevermind> defrysk: endeed
[10:07] <mdious> seeya nevermind
[10:07] <GirlRiver> mdious: currently each machine (4 of them at home) have local setups...I want to move to NFS server based home dirs and central password adming
[10:07] <mdious> anyone else from australia?
[10:07] <wraithsoul> Does no one seriously know the command to open a main menu?
[10:07] <wraithsoul> not I
[10:08] <mdious> you could use something like kerberos or i think you can just do it locally on the server with /etc/passwd....not really sure sorry i don't know anything about kerberos
[10:08] <GirlRiver> mdious: sorry, I mean to say 'password admin'
[10:09] <GirlRiver> mdious, I don't either.. I thought NIS but then I seem to read everywhere it is not very secure
[10:09] <mdious> i've never used it sorry
[10:09] <LLcoolM> why has linux-image-k7 been ceased?
[10:09] <mdious> kerberos would be better
[10:09] <defrysk> LLcoolM, linux-generic has it replaced
[10:10] <LLcoolM> defrysk: but generic seems to be optimized von i386?
[10:10] <defrysk> no
[10:10] <LLcoolM> while k7 was optimized for athlons
[10:10] <we2by> ubuntu edgy rocks! Best linux ditro I ever seen :)
[10:10] <defrysk> speeddifferenced are not notacible
[10:10] <we2by> starts up fast and works fast here :)
[10:10] <defrysk> the generic also supports smp and bigmem
[10:10] <blee> sss
[10:11] <defrysk> so generic is kinda like allinone
[10:11] <GirlRiver> does anyone know how to setup authentication using LDAP or Kerberos or PAM or have suggestions ?
[10:11] <defrysk> exept for amd64 of course
[10:11] <LLcoolM> defrysk: i have been using debian until now and speed difference has been big
[10:11] <LLcoolM> defrysk: i have an athlon-64 but i am forced to run 32-bit system
[10:11] <defrysk> LLcoolM, well then go back to debian
[10:12] <mdious> i'm off to enjoy 2 home made banana muffins...mmm, first time i had a muffin was last night....so having two the same again tonight...yuM!  Cya everyone, take care
[10:12] <we2by> LLcoolM: too bad
[10:12] <we2by> I'm gonna wait for the ps3 with linux pre-installed :)

[10:30] <Lynoure> MAXIMUS24: ok, then. I'm a a command line person, so I'd say you need to configure your monitor correctly in xorg.conf (but someone more into GUI could give you an easier answer, perhaps)
[10:30] <MAXIMUS24> can u tell me step by stem how to?

[10:31] <MAXIMUS24> where do i find this xorg.conf?
[10:33] <Lynoure> MAXIMUS24: /etc/X11/xorg.conf but really, there is probably someone who can tell you how to do it graphically, as for the cli way you need to know some numbers about your monitor
[10:33] <MAXIMUS24> i see
[10:34] <MAXIMUS24> cuz i got  where i can set the refresh rate but it will not let me go more then 60 mhz
[10:34] <MAXIMUS24> 60 hz
[10:34] <Lynoure> MAXIMUS24: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=76387 has an example but you need to know the vertical and horizontal sync rates

[10:36] <B1zz> when i did my distro update, i did it through the GUI way, i later found out not to do it that way.  Now when i do sudo su, i get some message complaining about configuration error-unknow item FAIL_DELAY (notify admin)
[10:37] <ucordes> Madeye: i think this is covered in the wiki
[10:37] <Terminus> MAXIMUS24: type `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg` into a terminal and press enter.

[10:37] <zoople> quick question. how do i modify GRUB to have a Windows installation boot by default

[10:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about isapnp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:38] <Terminus> MAXIMUS24: it will ask you how big your monitor is, among other things. i think it also gives you the option to enter VSync and HSync manually. not sure though. like Lynoure said, you need the values for that.

[10:45] <Doow> since upgrading to Edgy my /etc/fstab calls the partitions stuff like UUID=6B8FEF714EDDEB9E instead of /dev/hdd2. Is this something I should stick to when adding new partitions, and if so, how do I know what UUID to use?
[10:46] <MAXIMUS24> ok terminus  done
[10:46] <MAXIMUS24> but no change

[11:11] <RiGLEY> dhj3: You can try to install Automatix, that will install the drivers for you. Or you can also try the "Envy" script.
[11:12] <holycow> oh god
[11:12] <holycow> when will we ever kill this automatix shit
[11:12] <holycow> jesus
[11:12] <holycow> please stop using that crap
[11:12] <RiGLEY> ok, sorry :)
[11:12] <holycow> if you want something that actually follows the rules and doesn't ruin your system, use easyubuntu
[11:12] <holycow> for gods sake, stop telling people to use automatix
[11:13] <dromer> anybody some advice aon compiling gchempaint? I wish I could just apt-get it :(
[11:13] <siccness> calm down there big fella
[11:13] <RiGLEY> is automatix really that bad? I'm a newb., but it seemed to work OK for me.
[11:13] <holycow> dude, one single suggestion to use automatix results in thousands of questions for bizarro issues that comeup
[11:13] <Tomcat_> RiGLEY: It's only bad if it doesn't work afaik :)
[11:13] <Tomcat_> RiGLEY: Because there's no way to undo the stuff
[11:14] <holycow> thats a sideffect
[11:14] <nothlit> dromer, one tip, compile things with checkinstall. it tuns the finish product into a .deb and automatically installs it, makes it easier to manager (and remove)
[11:14] <holycow> automatix completely bypasses the packaging system and does its own black magic in the back ground
[11:14] <RiGLEY> ah, ok -> dhj3: Don't use it !! :)
[11:14] <holycow> once you install automatix you have no clue whatsover what has been changed on your system
[11:14] <holycow> its bad on microsoft levels
[11:14] <holycow> it should be classified as the first piece of linux malware imho
[11:15] <nothlit> both easy ubuntu and automatix are planning to use the native packaging systems i think, but yes right now they are completely evil
[11:16] <holycow> both projects are implicitly stupid
[11:16] <holycow> they should simply be setting up metapackages and their own repos if they want to do it right
[11:16] <dream> Any one here have ubuntu on riad
[11:16] <siccness> holycow: Could you elaborate on why they're stupid? In great detail, thanks.
[11:16] <Doow> automatix completely bypasses the packaging system and does its own black magic in the back ground
[11:17] <Doow> I think summed it up pretty good
[11:17] <siccness> Not really.
[11:17] <Doow> if you say so
[11:18] <nothlit> holycow, seveas's repo has  things like w32codecs and metapackages
[11:18] <holycow> nothlit, exactly!
[11:18] <holycow> i wish people would start off with that instead!
[11:18] <dhj3> when I am trying to enable restricted packages it does not ask me for my password when going into the manager and im not seeing the add button
[11:18] <holycow> Seveas, rocks!
[11:18] <holycow> dhj3, because you already typed your password in once.
[11:18] <holycow> if you were to logout and log back in it would ask for the pass again
[11:18] <dhj3> ahh
[11:19] <nothlit> dhj3, sudo keeps permissions for a period of around 15 minutes
[11:19] <Doow> dhj3: I think it remembers the password for 15 minutes as the default
[11:19] <holycow> yeah something like that i forget the specifics *nod*
[11:20] <dromer> nothlit: I just wish there was a usable ubuntu-package for gchempaint, it looks so damn good, just no way for me to use it :( (waaaay to many dependency's unable to meet)
[11:20] <dhj3> im seeing about 7 restricted packages.. confused on which one to install
[11:21] <dhj3> went with 386 and it had a few other things it marked auto for install when I marked that one
[11:21] <holycow> dromer, you would haveto recompile and repackage your own version of that i guess ... yeah it look slike it depends on a lib not in edgy at least
[11:21] <dromer> :(
[11:21] <dromer> and I'm on dapper
[11:21] <nothlit> holycow, sudo basically sets a time when the permissions will expire and references that, which is automatically refreshed or manually refreshed with sudo -v, while sudo -k changes that timestamp to the current time and sudo -K obliterates it entirely
[11:22] <holycow> nothlit, neat, i didn't know that
[11:22] <dromer> chemtool and xdrawchem just suck ass :(

[11:23] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:24] <holycow> dhj3, what you are running into is familiar.  i don't know nvidia installation off by heart but you do haveto do stuff in order
[11:24] <alexatreides> http://www.matxox.com -> Drivers todownload etc. Maybe I do something really wrong
[11:24] <Doow> oops, that should be alexatreides, not alex_
[11:24] <holycow> apt will let you fix stuff along the way tho, so don't give up
[11:24] <ucordes> i have a short cut to a game on my desktop. to run it i need to put the command "DISPLAY=:0" in front of it, to run it on top of my xserver. otherwise it won't start. how can i get the shortcut to do so? just putting it in front of the command with a space after won't work :(
[11:24] <holycow> dhj3, eventually you will develop a 'natural feel' for what to do and what not to do

[11:25] <holycow> kraut, same moment? not possible, you do it sequentially
[11:25] <nothlit> dhj3, you might need things like linux-headers or linux-restricted-modules when trying to install video driver modules
[11:26] <kraut> holycow: it must be possible
[11:26] <holycow> you would be breaking the law of conservation if you could do it simultaneously

[12:14] <Pupeno> It seems not many people are using the torrents to download the CDs, I couldn't get more than 10KB/s (I downloaded directly from a nearby FTP at 75KB/s) and now that I am seeding I don't seed more than 7KB/s (total).

[12:59] <Virtuall> RawSewage, (if not a secret) what does it do?
[12:59] <Allz> eikubuntu i need help with my x :S
[12:59] <RawSewage> Virtuall,  it downloads the ARchers from BBC, then encodes it and renames it and files it in a folder
[12:59] <Virtuall> Ragnaroek, it's all about working directory, i think
[12:59] <Allz> eikubuntu i need help with my x .can you maybe help me .?
[12:59] <RawSewage> Virtuall, it downlaods a rm feed
[01:00] <RawSewage> I mean .ra
[01:00] <RawSewage> Virtuall, it works when I double-click it
[01:00] <RawSewage> but gets ignored by cron

[01:01] <shape> frostwire or something similar for kubuntu edgy eft
[01:01] <RawSewage> Virtuall, ok thx
[01:02] <Virtuall> RawSewage, and then try /bin/bash /path/to/script instead of /path/to/script
[01:02] <Virtuall> might be the problem too
[01:02] <RawSewage> ok
[01:02] <RawSewage> that sounds like it might work
[01:02] <Virtuall> *might* ;)
[01:02] <RawSewage> it makes sense
[01:03] <RawSewage> Virtuall, is there a cd on that line
[01:03] <RawSewage> Virtuall, or just like you typed it
[01:03] <RawSewage> Virtuall, nm, I'll try that
[01:03] <Virtuall> RawSewage, I meant cd to the *needed* direcotry
[01:03] <fildo> hi how can i change system time via bash

[01:05] <fildo> thanks
[01:05] <fildo> appreciated
[01:06] <fildo> any good guides for mrtg

[01:22] <kenThomson> You see, i want to setup Dual boot on two HDDs both PATA. The first one is 8GB, and i am having Windows XP, running on it. I want to setup Ubuntu on the other one 40GB HDD.
[01:22] <azcazandco> can anyone help me change my udma mode?  I have been trying to get dapper / edgy installed on an ide drive and I am sure this is the issue, I asked in the forums about the problems and was told to run the following command http://pastebin.ca/250833

[01:23] <theD3viL> i have big problems with tv-out...wont work in X..i tried all with xorg.conf :S
[01:23] <Doow> kenThomson: what is the problem? =)
[01:23] <kenThomson> Doow: Now i dont want Ubuntu to do anything to my bootloader on the Windows (8gb) HDD. But want Ubuntu to be self contained in the 40GB HDD. THis is so, becuase if i unplug any of my HDDS, then too the other OS boots normally
[01:24] <Doow> kenThomson: ah
[01:24] <oyvind> Hi, does anyone here happen to know how to change Evolutions standard reply-format ?
[01:24] <rambo3> Allz type : cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE
[01:24] <Doow> kenThomson: you'd probably have to fiddle in the bios to change that though
[01:24] <feydin> hi there, is there any repository out there which includes freedesktop's "tracker" for amd64?
[01:24] <kenThomson> SO than i could simply install Ubuntu on the 40GB HDD while the Windows HDD is unplugged, and than add some lines to the GRUB bootloader after booting Ubuntu that would make my windows appear on the list, in the GRUB bootloader
[01:25] <lilla92> hey what's this? HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
[01:25] <kenThomson> Doow: right?
[01:25] <Doow> kenThomson: well, to change what HD it boots from
[01:25] <Doow> kenThomson: other than that it sounds like a workable idea
[01:26] <rambo3> man ioctl
[01:26] <lilla92> no man for ioctl :(
[01:26] <Doow> kenThomson: I can give you my menu.lst if you want to know approx what to add to yours
[01:27] <Doow> kenThomson: since the auto-detect obviously won't work
[01:27] <kenThomson> Doow: good!, now the problem is, i want to make the LINUX SWAP partition on the Windows (8GB) HDD, (it has got 1GB unformatted space, i can manage that!), that means that when i am installing Ubuntu i would have to keep the Windows HDD plugged in (to make the swap partition in it). But that also means that Ubuntu would eventually ask me (should i add reference of GRUB in Windows HDD sector 0, or something to that effect). But i dont want that. I
[01:27] <kenThomson> want Ubuntu to boot only from its HDD, and let me add those few lines in the menu.1st myself. SO how do i do that?
[01:28] <rambo3> maby becouse i am in debian etch , anyway its for manipulating files
[01:28] <MikeyMike> is there a video screen capture package for ubuntu
[01:28] <Daviey> I'm having major problems with ubuntu edgy partitioner (of install), can somebody help!?

[01:29] <Daviey> I left it going for three days!  Still didn't finish!
[01:29] <MikeyMike> rofl
[01:29] <MikeyMike> something is definetly wrong
[01:29] <rambo3> Daviey, use alternative cd
[01:29] <Daviey> what difference will that have?
[01:29] <Doow> kenThomson: you could install ubuntu without swap and add it afterwards to /etc/fstab
[01:29] <MikeyMike> i want desktop capture softwareeeeeeeeeee
[01:30] <rambo3> Daviey, its becouse  gparted sucks
=== mumbles-out is now known as mumbles
[01:30] <Daviey> rambo3: okay, i'll download that now
[01:30] <Daviey> cheers
[01:30] <kenThomson> Doow: Thank you, but in the ubuntu forums i found a v.detailed post on how to make Windows XP appear in the GRUB, through editing menu.1st, but according to that advice, the Windows HDD should be unplugged while i install Ubuntu (so that the GRUB recides entirely on Ubuntu's own HDD). But as i want to make a LINUX SWAP partition on the Windows HDD, i would have to keep it plugged in. But is there anyway that i can do it all while installing Ubuntu
[01:30] <kenThomson> itself. AS i am not comfortable with mounting swap partitions and the like.
[01:30] <MikeyMike> no one has video capture for linux?
[01:30] <MikeyMike> argh
[01:31] <Doow> kenThomson: you can make the swap partition after you installed ubuntu
[01:31] <Doow> use fdisk
[01:31] <Allz> rombo3 here you go -> could not start x server (your graphical environment ) due to some internal error please contact your system adminstrator or check your syslog to diagnose in the meantime this display will be disblede please restart gdm when you have fixed your problem
[01:31] <Toma-> swapfile ftw
[01:31] <Doow> or possibly gparted
[01:31] <Allz> rombo3 now what to do :S
[01:32] <rambo3> kent : mkswap /dev/hdbX && swapon /dev/hdbX
[01:32] <kenThomson> Doow: So after i installed ubuntu, i can go to gparted format the WIndows HDD's ending 1GB as linux swap. And than how do i make Ubuntu recognise THAT SWAP partition each time it reboots?
[01:32] <Allz> rambo3 *
[01:32] <kenThomson> rambo3: thats as complicated as it gets. could please exaplain in simpler terms
[01:32] <kdefrysk> kenny, you can set that up in fstab
[01:32] <kdefrysk> kenThomson, that is
[01:32] <kenThomson> kdefrysk: I dont know what is fstab
=== _ebola is now known as freebsd_fan
[01:33] <Doow> kenThomson: add something like "/dev/hda2 none swap sw 0 0" to your /etc/fstab
[01:33] <kenThomson> Doow: what will that do?
[01:33] <Doow> kenThomson: where /dev/hda2 is the partition with your swap on
[01:34] <kdefrysk> kenThomson, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab
[01:34] <kenThomson> Doow: My swap will be in the ending part (LAST 1GB) of Windows partition. So after i install Ubuntu without any SWAP. i shall have to add that line to /etc/fstab, right?
[01:35] <kenThomson> Is there someway i can take care of all this during install itself?
[01:35] <Doow> kenThomson: yep
[01:35] <geokok> Hi. I want to install azureus and tuxguitar but when I install one the other gets uninstalled cause of this libswt3.2-gtk-java
[01:35] <Doow> kenThomson: dunno, I'm not very good with the installer, only used it once
[01:35] <rambo3> kenThomson, you make a swap partition with mkswap  on partition of /dev/ hd (is for IDE (hd0)) and a is patition 1 , b is 2 (hdb)   swapon tells ubuntu to mount that partition on boot.  so mkwap /dev/* and swapon [same]  . && is just to connect two of them if first fails so will second
[01:35] <Doow> kenThomson: everything I say is general linux stuff =)
[01:36] <rambo3> !fixres > Allz
[01:36] <Doow> kenThomson: rambo3s method might be easier for you though, just make sure that you use the correct device
[01:36] <kenThomson> rambo3: my swap partition is already formatted and ready. I just need to do something that, would make Ubuntu recognise and cache to that partition everytime it boots up
[01:36] <geokok> Azureus uses libswt3.2-gtk-java. Tux guitar uses libswt3.1-gtk-java. So when I install one the other gets uninstalled.
[01:37] <rambo3> kenThomson, then use : sudo  swapon /dev/
[01:37] <rambo3> what ever the name od dev is
[01:37] <valehru_server> Hey guys, could anyone could you recommend a client that can handle multiple torrents? - besides azureus
[01:37] <kenThomson> rambo3: but i need Ubuntu to mount my swao automatically everytime.
[01:37] <rambo3> it will
[01:37] <kenThomson> rambo3: *swap
[01:38] <azcazandco> does anyone run ubuntu on an ide drive here?  if so can you run sudo hdparm -i /dev/hda and tell me what udma mode u are using?
[01:38] <Qwerty> valehru_server, kTorrent ?
[01:38] <rambo3> kenThomson, man swapon
[01:38] <kenThomson> rambo3: So by putting "sudo swapon /dev/hd0a/" at the CLI, would configure Ubuntu in such a way that it automatically mounts it everytime?
[01:39] <valehru_server> Qwerty, thanks
[01:39] <rambo3> kenThomson, there is no hd0a
[01:39] <kenThomson> And i wouldn't have to everytime put that command in CLI after booting Ubuntu, to mount the linux partition?
[01:39] <rambo3> kenThomson, yes
[01:39] <Qwerty> valehru_server, there is also BitTornado for Ubuntu
[01:39] <kenThomson> rambo3: And is there some way that this swap partition can be handeled somehow during Ubuntu install itself?
[01:40] <rambo3> kenThomson, if you use manual partition then yes , for the rest i dont know sice thats the only method i use
[01:41] <Doow> azcazandco: hmm.. it lists a lot of udma modes, one with a star in front
[01:41] <_joey> is anyone using usb wifi here?
[01:41] <Doow> azcazandco: maybe that's what it uses =)
[01:41] <Doow> azcazandco:  UDMA modes: udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5
[01:41] <_joey> I am at a point of getting rid of linux
[01:41] <_joey> from my computer, god damn it
[01:41] <rambo3> Allz, did you read what ubotu sent you
[01:41] <rausb0> _joey: yes, a dwl-g122
[01:42] <_joey> rausb0 yes
[01:42] <_joey> that's what I use
[01:42] <rausb0> _joey: which revision?
[01:42] <kenThomson> rambo3: And after i do "sudo swapon /dev/hda", how can i check whether Ubuntu as 'really' mounted the swap partition or not?
[01:42] <_joey> 2.03
[01:42] <azcazandco> Doow: mine uses 2
[01:42] <_joey> I've got ralink driver up and running with wpa support
[01:42] <rausb0> _joey: thats not what i meant
[01:42] <azcazandco> trying to figure out if that is my problem
[01:42] <_joey> and what did you mean?
[01:42] <rausb0> _joey: hardware revision b1
[01:43] <_joey> rausb0 2.03
[01:43] <Doow> azcazandco: no idea, dunno anything about such things =(
[01:43] <tk_> hi there , can anyone tell me the following : i have installed icewm in my kubuntu 6.06 ... how can i choose which window manager will be start wenn the system starts ?
[01:43] <azcazandco> me neither, I think I have found out what my problem is, i just have no idea how to fix it
[01:44] <_joey> the problem is after average load it stops working and I have to reboot reload the module manually
[01:44] <Doow> azcazandco: what problem do you have?
[01:44] <rausb0> _joey: look on backside of the stick. it says: model no. dwl-g122, h/w ver: b1, f/w ver: 1.00
[01:44] <lastnode> tk_, go to kdm, choose which session
[01:44] <azcazandco> tried 3 different ubuntu distros yesterday and all of them freeze shortly after login
[01:44] <_joey> rausb0 god damn it I am telling 2.03
[01:44] <_joey> how many more times do I have to type this?
[01:44] <lastnode> _joey, language please
[01:44] <Doow> azcazandco: gdm login?
[01:44] <azcazandco> yes shortly after that
[01:44] <_joey> lastnode what if he doesn't understand and I'm loosing patience here?:)
[01:45] <rausb0> _joey: i just wanted to make sure we are talking about the same hardware (which is not the case, i think)
[01:45] <Doow> azcazandco: don't sound lika  HD problem if it gets that far without any errors
[01:45] <bqwed> how come sudo modprobe sis900 or suso modprobe via-rhine says FATAL module not found in ubuntu server? im pretty sure they both exists in /lib/modules/uname -r.... ? really annoying that the new freaking edgy doesnt discover the nics on boot up
[01:45] <_joey> who cares? The same chip is used
[01:45] <lastnode> _joey, this is a volunteer support channel. if you lose patience you can take a break and come back later. he's trying to _help_ you.
[01:45] <Doow> azcazandco: I'd guess on graphical or sound drivers
[01:45] <azcazandco> Doow: any idea on how I begin checking this?
[01:45] <rausb0> _joey: there might be slight differences. which usd id (vend/prod) does lsusb show?
[01:46] <lastnode> bqwed, is it a restricted module?
[01:46] <rambo3> kenThomson, cat /proc/mounts or something
[01:46] <_joey> Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2001:3c00 D-Link Corp. [hex] 
[01:46] <bqwed> lastnode how in the  world do i know?! ive been using freebsd, linux, ubuntu with these nics forever!!
[01:46] <bqwed> all i did was a clean install of edgy server
[01:46] <smoenux> !mp3

[01:46] <lastnode> bqwed, was it working in dapper?
[01:47] <_joey> lastnode I won't be coming back
[01:47] <lastnode> _joey, im sorry to hear that, all of us try our very best.
[01:47] <azcazandco> Doow: I installed PC Linux OS last night before I went to bed and it installed fine and didnt crash
[01:47] <Doow> azcazandco: you could do less /var/log/gdm/\:0.log
[01:47] <rambo3> kenThomson, and or just look at you fstab
[01:47] <_joey> lastnode who all?
[01:47] <Iceman_B> I have a SATA disk which under windows has 2 simple volumes, yet under Ubuntu only the first is visible
[01:47] <Allz> rambo3 i am on it .but one problem .if i do cp /etc/x11/xorg.conf /etc/x11/xorg.conf.custom and the output is connot state "etc/x11/xorg.conf"
[01:47] <Doow> azcazandco: and see if there's any error message there
[01:47] <rausb0> _joey: okay, mine is the same. i use the official driver from ralink (RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.8.0.tar.gz) and compiled it from source.
[01:47] <Iceman_B> is there any way to mount the second volume?
[01:47] <_joey> only rausb0 was trying:)
[01:47] <kenThomson> rambo3: Doow: kdefrysk: Thank you all, looks like my problem is solved. And keep up the spirit!
[01:47] <azcazandco> Doow: how do I mount hda1?
[01:47] <_joey> rausb0 I am using the official driver too
[01:47] <Allz> rambo3 :S
[01:47] <rambo3> Allz, linux is case sensitive it X11 not x11
[01:47] <azcazandco> I am currently booted off my sata drive
[01:48] <Doow> azcazandco: is it listed in your fstab?
[01:48] <azcazandco> dunno
[01:48] <_joey> rausb0: rt2570
[01:48] <rausb0> _joey: hmm, no problems so far. but i havent used wpa for a longer period.
[01:48] <azcazandco> Doow: will you be here in 10 mins? I gotta pick my kid up from nursery
[01:48] <Doow> azcazandco: dunno
[01:48] <azcazandco> fair enough, I gotta run
[01:48] <rausb0> _joey: the problem is that all drivers for this thing have the same module name
[01:48] <Doow> azcazandco: but check the mount command
[01:48] <azcazandco> will be back though
[01:48] <Doow> azcazandco: should be all info there
[01:49] <rambo3> Allz, you can use tab key to auto compltete as type /etc/X and then press tab key
[01:49] <_joey> rausb0 mine works all right when, however, it stop under average network load and I have to re-insert the module
[01:49] <bqwed> lastnode: any idea?
[01:49] <Allz> rambo3 connot creat file .cause it is read only :S
[01:49] <rausb0> _joey: there is the ralink one, the sourceforge rt2570 and a hacked one to allow sending while in monitor mode
[01:49] <Allz> the system is read only
[01:49] <tk_> where can i find kdm ?
[01:49] <blackduck> anyone can help me with changing utf-8 to iso8859 encoding?...  i need my nordic letter to work
[01:49] <lastnode> bqwed, i missed whatever you said, please highlight my nick when you're talking to me :s
[01:49] <nelly> hola
[01:50] <lastnode> tk_, kdm is the screen that loads with the login box etc.
[01:50] <rambo3> Allz, are you root
[01:50] <Allz> yes
[01:50] <rausb0> _joey: didn't had that problem. the only thing that happens with all rt2570 drivers is that the system load goes up to 2.00 even if no traffic is happening.
[01:50] <Allz> i dont need sudo when i am on the root
[01:50] <Allz> rambo3
[01:50] <Doow> since upgrading to Edgy my /etc/fstab calls the partitions stuff like UUID=6B8FEF714EDDEB9E instead of /dev/hdd2. Anyone know what that's all about?
[01:51] <tk_> thx i will try it
[01:51] <rambo3> Allz, and you are not on live CD
[01:51] <rausb0> _joey: (the load only goes to 2.00 when the interface is "up")
[01:51] <Allz> nope!
[01:51] <Allz> rambo3
[01:51] <lastnode> Doow, i got that during Betas, but it's fixed now. have you fully dist-upgraded?
[01:52] <Doow> lastnode: I did apt-get dist-upgrade if that's what you mean
[01:52] <Doow> lastnode: or maybe I did it from synaptic, not 100% sure =)
[01:53] <rambo3> Allz, just run : dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:53] <lastnode> Doow, that shouldn't be there then. try another dist-upgrade, maybe it didn't get everything
[01:53] <Doow> lastnode: each replacement comes with a comment like # /dev/hdd5 -- converted during upgrade to edgy
[01:53] <weepy> hi i can't work out how to set up an account on proftpd
[01:53] <weepy> any ideas ?
[01:53] <soundray> Doow: without having read up on it, it seems that the UUIDs are links to your partitions in /dev/disk/by-uuid
[01:53] <Doow> soundray: ah
[01:53] <Doow> soundray: didn't even know such a thing existed =)
[01:53] <soundray> Doow: I think doing it this way prevents a partition with a changed name being mounted in error.
[01:54] <[GuS] > Bon Jour les gens..
[01:54] <lastnode> Doow, oh wait, the bug was that each partition was being iconed twice on the desktop, is this happening?
[01:54] <Doow> lastnode: nope, nothing like that
[01:54] <lastnode> Doow, because the UIDs themselves are present in edgy, and shouldn't concern you
[01:54] <lastnode> oh right
[01:54] <lastnode> great
[01:54] <Doow> lastnode: in fact I don't have any icons at all on my desktop =)
[01:55] <lastnode> i see :-)
[01:55] <Doow> soundray: sounds like it's safe to change it back to something human readable then?
[01:55] <soundray> Doow, I would say it's safe, unless you change your partitioning
[01:56] <soundray> Doow: you will have icons for filesystems mounted under /media I think
[01:56] <Doow> soundray: still use the same, and df still shows the normal names, so I can just check it there
[01:57] <stojance> How to switch to runlevel 3, killing X
[01:57] <Kazuhiro> telinit 3 from a console
[01:57] <soundray> stojance: try 'sudo init 3'
[01:57] <stojance> don't work
[01:57] <Kazuhiro> put sudo infront
[01:58] <Kazuhiro> you need to be root to switch run levels
[01:58] <soundray> stojance: but the recommended way to stop X is 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
[01:58] <rambo3> did you mean runlevel 2
[01:58] <stojance> I need to run without X
[01:58] <soundray> stojance: always, or just until the next boot?
[01:58] <Kazuhiro> if your in x try pressing CTRL+ALT Backpsace
[01:58] <rambo3> do what soundray told you , you dont need to change init
[01:59] <Doow> stojance: just turn off X then, don't change runlevel for that
[01:59] <thesaltydog> when I mount my /media/windows partition, it doesn't show up on the desktop.. Nautilus flag is set.
[01:59] <stojance> I need till the next boot
[01:59] <Allz> rambo3 dpkg-reconfigure not found
[01:59] <soundray> stojance: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
[01:59] <Allz> this is not a command
[01:59] <Allz> it say rambo3 :S
[01:59] <stojance> ok
[01:59] <stojance> bye see ya!
[02:00] <rambo3> Allz, did you have a functioning ubuntu ?
[02:00] <rambo3> before this
[02:00] <Allz> yeah
[02:00] <Allz> i reinstalld ubuntu
[02:00] <Allz> i had kubuntu live cd
[02:00] <soundray> Allz: try with the path -- '/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure'
[02:01] <Allz> and i installd ubuntu by . apt-get install ubuntu dekstop
[02:01] <Allz> soundry
[02:01] <Allz> please write type
[02:01] <Allz> so i can understand
[02:01] <stojance> is there another command
[02:01] <stojance> like kill or something
[02:02] <soundray> Allz: okay, what package do you want to reconfigure?
[02:02] <Allz> all
[02:02] <Allz> xserver
[02:02] <Allz> i want to reconfigure
[02:02] <rambo3> Allz, i think you have errors on you files system thry that fist , if it doesnt work try fsck
[02:02] <soundray> stojance: '/bin/sudo /usr/bin/dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[02:03] <soundray> Allz: '/bin/sudo /usr/bin/dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[02:03] <Allz> rambo3 what should i do then?
[02:03] <Allz> is fsck command?
[02:03] <Seiruu> Quick question: if I want to dualboot ubuntu/win xp, linux can't access/write on NTFS, right?
[02:04] <soundray> Seiruu: it can, if you're prepared to take a small risk and install the fuse driver
[02:04] <soundray> !fuse | Seiruu
[02:04] <ubotu> Seiruu: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[02:04] <rambo3> Allz, try first what soundray told you
[02:05] <soundray> Seiruu: to share data on a partition or removable drive between Windows and Linux, I recommend ext3 with a second extended filesystem driver for Windows.
[02:05] <rambo3> if it doesnt help you can try fsck /dev/hdX ,
[02:05] <Seiruu> I see thanks, any plans of linux to make accessing NTFS more of a reality?
[02:05] <Doow> is fuse better than ntfs-3g?
[02:06] <jrib> Seiruu: reading works fine
[02:06] <heikki> ntfs-3g uses fuse
[02:06] <Seiruu> Because that would make dualbooting ubuntu/windows xp a lot easier for newbies like me
[02:06] <Doow> heikki: ah =)
[02:06] <soundray> Seiruu: work is under way, but it is difficult because NTFS is proprietary, poorly documented and has complex, rarely used features.
[02:06] <Seiruu> jrib: Yeh I know, but writing on it would be useful
[02:06] <heikki> fuse = filesystem userspace or something :)
[02:06] <Kazuhiro> ntfs-3g works okay.
=== yama is now known as yama_away
[02:06] <Iceman_B> NTFS has neato compression stuff
[02:07] <Iceman_B> but I'd say thats all there is to it
[02:07] <Iceman_B> of course I'm no wiz
[02:07] <Iceman_B> maybe it fragments less...
[02:07] <Kazuhiro> I agree with soundray though, use ext3 for sharing data between windows xp and linux
[02:07] <Seiruu> I see ext3
[02:08] <soundray> Iceman_B: compressed data is more vulnerable. If I want compression, I use a zip utility. I don't want the filesystem to do it for me.
[02:08] <prestosd> i can't run any 3d apps, my drivers are nvidia-glx-legacy, and my card is the NVIDIA Riva TNT
[02:08] <prestosd> can anyone help
[02:08] <Kazuhiro> http://www.chrysocome.net/explore2fs
[02:08] <npgmstr> ok little help. I made the switch last night from xp to ubuntu. though I love it. I have one issue
[02:08] <Kazuhiro> http://www.fs-driver.org/
[02:09] <soundray> prestosd: do you see a fullscreen nvidia logo when you start X?
[02:09] <prestosd> yes
[02:09] <npgmstr> I am un able to find a program that will allow me to format my second hd so I can access and use it.
[02:09] <Doow> npgmstr: use fdisk or gparted
[02:09] <npgmstr> any tips on a good free program to help me with my matter?
[02:09] <Allz> rambo3 didnt work
[02:10] <Seiruu> So basically, while I can't write in linux on NTFS, I can go back to windows and copy all those files to NTFS?
[02:10] <soundray> prestosd: 'glxinfo | head' -- is there a line that shows the vendor string?
[02:10] <rambo3> Allz, type : fdisk -l
[02:10] <npgmstr> I tried qtparted but that did help me
[02:10] <kdefrysk> npgmstr, what Doow said
[02:10] <rambo3> and look for Linux and type 83
[02:10] <npgmstr> ok best site to get one of those
[02:11] <prestosd> whow!
[02:11] <npgmstr> I am a newbe to the linux game. sorry
[02:11] <Doow> npgmstr: you probably have fdisk and you can install gparted with apt-get or synaptic
[02:11] <prestosd> it just says Xlib: extenstion "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[02:11] <prestosd> over and over
[02:12] <prestosd> then at the top it says
[02:12] <prestosd> couldn't find RGB GLX visual
[02:12] <soundray> npgmstr: gparted is packaged for ubuntu. Learn how to install software on ubuntu, first
[02:12] <Doow> npgmstr: fdisk is CLI, so just run it from a terminal
[02:12] <soundray> !software | npgmstr
[02:12] <ubotu> npgmstr: You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[02:12] <kdefrysk> awkward way = the windows way
[02:12] <npgmstr> thanks for all the help guys
[02:13] <Allz> rambo3 the output are .hd1 hd3 hd5 hd6 .in hd1 is hpfs/ntfs in hd3 extended in hd5 linux and then in hd6 is linux swap
[02:13] <soundray> prestosd: you probably need to make a new xorg.conf
[02:14] <prestosd> oh
[02:14] <prestosd> okay
[02:14] <prestosd> !!!how???
[02:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how??? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:14] <weepy> has any one here configured proftd ?
[02:14] <OmniD> My mixer doesn't work right :c
[02:14] <soundray> prestosd: check 'ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.2006*' - any files listed would be backups.
[02:14] <rambo3> Allz, do you have any live cd
[02:15] <Allz> yes i have .the first one i used
[02:15] <Allz> rambo3 i have live cd .but it is kubuntu
[02:15] <Allz> so i used kubuntu live cd
[02:15] <Allz> what to do?
[02:15] <Allz> rambo3
[02:15] <prestosd> when I type that command it says no such file or directory
[02:16] <rambo3> boot with live cd and type: sudo fsck /dev/hd5
[02:16] <prestosd> but ill tell you now, I have made multiple backups of xorg.conf before! lol
[02:16] <Allz> ok
[02:17] <soundray> prestosd: that means you have no backups. What I suggest then is that you run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg', select nvidia as the driver and
[02:17] <soundray> prestosd: I have another idea...
[02:17] <prestosd> should I try your fist idea first?
[02:17] <soundray> prestosd: check 'lsmod | grep nvidia' to see if the module is loaded
[02:17] <soundray> prestosd: do the lsmod first
[02:18] <soundray> prestosd: while I get another cup of coffee ;)
[02:18] <prestosd> i did it
[02:18] <prestosd> lol
[02:18] <prestosd> it says nvidia and some numbers
[02:18] <kdefrysk> do sudo nvidia-xconfig
[02:18] <kdefrysk> and restart x
[02:18] <prestosd> me?
[02:18] <kdefrysk> thats all
[02:19] <Allz> rambo3 okei .what should i do boot from the cd
[02:19] <Allz> or put the cd in while i am on the same stuff?
[02:19] <kdefrysk> prestosd, thats the way to setup nvidia in ubuntu
[02:19] <soundray> prestosd: all right, that's fine then.
[02:19] <rambo3> Allz, yes you cant repair fs if you are on it so you nned to reboot inot live cd
[02:19] <soundray> kdefrysk: even the legacy version? (prestosd)
[02:20] <Allz> rambo3 :S okei now i am not so sure
[02:20] <Allz> cause i am on the live cd then what?

[02:24] <skreet> allz, yes.
[02:25] <darkanyel> help me plz
[02:25] <darkanyel> hi, i have a problem with bluetooth, I already install gnome-bluetooth but i can't find the comamd "gnome-bluetooth" :S

[02:25] <Allz> rambo3 just kidding around me .that it wont install over it
[02:25] <skreet> jrib: are they just plain format?

[02:25] <ubotu> darkanyel: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[02:25] <prestosd> when i typed nvidia-glx-config it says:
[02:25] <skreet> !Templates
[02:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Templates - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:25] <azcazandco> seems pretty dumb that I would not be able to do it, I am wondering if it is a kernel bug or something?
[02:25] <SoftIce> hi, adding a service to startup with ubuntu
[02:25] <jrib> skreet: just create any file you want, and then "create document" basically just copies the file in ~/Templates to your current location
[02:25] <SoftIce> update-rc.d server add?
[02:26] <SoftIce> err update-rc.d service add ?
[02:26] <prestosd> /usr/sbin/nvidia-glx-config with unkown command: usage: /usr/sbin/nvidia-glx-config [enable|disable] 
[02:26] <prestosd> and i didnt paste that
[02:26] <kdefrysk> sudo nvidia xconfig enable
[02:26] <soundray> azcazandco: it sounds to me like you may have set the jumpers wrong
[02:26] <kdefrysk> sudo nvidia-xconfig enable
[02:26] <prestosd> kdefrysk: Ill try that....
[02:26] <kdefrysk> or whatever
[02:27] <prestosd> ah ha
[02:27] <azcazandco> soundray: in what way?  no jumpers meant single or master and it is the only drive on that ide slot
[02:27] <vyoman> Allz you can install ubuntu on a IDE or SATA drive, the live CD runs live ubuntu from the CD without installing it to a hard disk, that is optional, hope that helos

[02:27] <kdefrysk> prestosd, legacy seems to use the old school way
[02:27] <soundray> azcazandco: oh, it's not that then, sorry
[02:27] <Doow> azcazandco: I still think that it's something else than your HD since you get that far
[02:28] <prestosd> then it gives instructions on how to update the md5sum entry
[02:28] <azcazandco> I have no issues installing another distro and running it
[02:28] <kdefrysk> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[02:28] <prestosd> i did that
[02:28] <Doow> azcazandco: what makes you believe that it's the HD?
[02:28] <prestosd> and it errored and gave instructions on how to update a md5sum entry
[02:29] <prestosd> il do what it says.....
[02:29] <soundray> azcazandco: might it be overheating?
[02:29] <azcazandco> I checked my system temperatures, processor 44 dregrees
[02:29] <soundray> prestosd: worth trying
[02:29] <Doow> azcazandco: did you check the gdm log?
[02:30] <kdefrysk> of course
[02:30] <prestosd> soundray: thanks, it give says i need to change the nv in my xorg.conf to nvidia
[02:30] <kdefrysk> you editted xorg.conf
[02:30] <soundray> azcazandco: I had a similar problem when my VGA cooler wasn't spinning
[02:30] <vision> hi guys
[02:30] <azcazandco> one of my friends just suggested it is the cable that is the problem#
[02:30] <soundray> prestosd: but you've done that already, as shown by the logo
[02:30] <Doow> soundray: the odd thing here is that it always hangs just after he logs in with gmd
[02:30] <prestosd> oops
[02:30] <vision> any one know how to set up xgl?
[02:30] <Doow> soundray: gdm*

[02:31] <Allz> vyoman and how the hell .can do i like it
[02:31] <Allz> so i can boot from it
[02:31] <prestosd> soundray: then what should i do?
[02:31] <Allz> but dont install it :
[02:31] <Allz> :S
[02:31] <azcazandco> Doow: I can run for 5 mins or even just 5 secs before it freezes
[02:31] <Doow> azcazandco: oh
[02:32] <prestosd> BTW: Every time I boot up it gives me a pop-up that says glx-config couldnt load...or something like that
[02:32] <kdefrysk> prestosd, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:32] <kdefrysk> run the defaults
[02:32] <Doow> azcazandco: my bad then, I got the impression before that it was just after logging in
[02:32] <prestosd> ill try
[02:32] <azcazandco> usually under a minute
[02:32] <soundray> prestosd: it's back to the suggestion of 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'.
[02:32] <kdefrysk> prestosd, then  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[02:32] <kdefrysk> then it should work fine
[02:32] <soundray> prestosd: you could also paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf on the pastebin for us to have a look
[02:32] <azcazandco> I think it happens when I try to read write to the drive or something
[02:32] <Allz> yyoman .just want to fix hd5!! thorugh live cd .but i dont know .how
[02:33] <prestosd> A ha!
[02:33] <Allz> i am afreid that i am gonna do mistake that will install a new system
[02:33] <prestosd> i had a spelling error!
[02:33] <azcazandco> Doow: my friend is suggesting getting a newer ide cable for it
[02:33] <prestosd> i redid the dpkg command and it worked!
[02:33] <prestosd> it popped up a config thing now
[02:33] <Doow> azcazandco: worth a try, it's pretty cheap =)
[02:34] <kdefrysk> prestosd, also learn something about autocomplete and copy/pasting ;)
[02:34] <azcazandco> he says "i think you need an 80 channel cable to do udma3 and over"
[02:34] <julip> hi all how do i make a beep sound from the command line
[02:34] <prestosd> and is asking me which x server driver i should do
[02:34] <azcazandco> so maybe it is auto detecting the cable speed
[02:34] <prestosd> which should i choose???
[02:34] <kdefrysk> prestosd, run the defaults
[02:34] <soundray> azcazandco: you definitely want a ATA133 compatible cable. If your IDE cable has only 40 wires (not pins) then it's not
[02:34] <prestosd> k
[02:34] <kdefrysk> just hit enter
[02:34] <kdefrysk> prestosd, then  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[02:34] <azcazandco> ok
[02:34] <Doow> julip how portable does it have to be? =)
[02:34] <kdefrysk> when all done that is
[02:35] <azcazandco> sounds like this might be a good starting point to try and get this resolved
[02:35] <julip> just want to set sound card on server install
[02:35] <julip> just want to test sound card on server install
[02:35] <prestosd> k

[02:36] <Doow> julip: aplay /path/to/some/file.wav
[02:36] <prestosd> should i turn on kernel framebuffer device interface?
[02:36] <julip> ty
[02:36] <Doow> julip: if you use alsa
[02:36] <azcazandco> soundray: could that be causing a hardware glitch then?
[02:36] <azcazandco> and crashing the system?
[02:36] <kdefrysk> prestosd, defaults!!
[02:36] <prestosd> kdefrysk: LOL
[02:36] <prestosd> okay
[02:37] <julip> Playing WAVE '/usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Mono
[02:37] <julip> no sound :(
[02:37] <soundray> azcazandco: it most definitely could. Especially if you think it may happen when you read/write instead of just read
[02:37] <azcazandco> yes
[02:37] <Doow> or you can echo /some/file.anything /dev/audio0
[02:37] <azcazandco> cool well thanks for helping my sanity guys
[02:37] <Doow> julip: does the server have more than one sound card?
[02:38] <julip> no
[02:38] <soundray> prestosd: go with the defaults until you see options that are dri and glx related. Those need to be active
[02:38] <azcazandco> I aint no linux buff so have to rely on the good will of others to get through problems
[02:38] <Doow> julip: check alsamixer command so it isn't muted
[02:38] <azcazandco> and a bit of reading of course
[02:38] <notwist> does anyone here know why i cant install a new OS on my laptop? Not a single one seems to find my harddrive (tried ubuntu, xp, vista), but the harddrive works fine in the pre-installed windows xp. Any ideas? The vista install said something about drivers
[02:39] <soundray> notwist: how new is that laptop?
[02:39] <prestosd> k
[02:39] <azcazandco> thanks again, will keep you posted if you are about later
[02:40] <prestosd> soundray, kdefrysk: oops, I'm finished. and i didn't see any specific glx stuff
[02:40] <Doow> julip: hmm.. ignore that echo command, should be cat /some/file/ > /dev/audio0
[02:40] <kdefrysk> prestosd, then  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[02:40] <prestosd> can do
[02:40] <kdefrysk> do it !!
[02:40] <julip> np
[02:40] <prestosd> YEAH!!!

[02:41] <prestosd> im not
[02:41] <notwist> soundray: why do you wonder?
[02:41] <soundray> prestosd: then close all your apps first
[02:41] <wxq> bye
[02:42] <wxq> quit
[02:42] <prestosd> should i ctrl alt backspace now?? I closed all apps (except this
[02:42] <wxq> exit
[02:42] <soundray> notwist: because very occasionally, there are incompatibilities in new chipsets
[02:42] <Doow> wxq: =)
[02:42] <kdefrysk> prestosd, /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:42] <prestosd> ???????????/

[02:42] <notwist> soundray: the thing is, i have win xp installed now (preinstalled). but putting in a windows xp CD-ROM, it cant find the harddrive..

[02:45] <Doow> julip: there is a #alsa channel, they might be able to help you more

[02:45] <kdefrysk> crimsun, is good at soundstuff
[02:45] <julip> what is esd
[02:45] <Doow> enlightenment sound daemon
[02:46] <RASMAN> julip, it is the gnome sound environment.  If it is holding onto alsa then nothing else can.
[02:46] <kdefrysk> its the deafault sounddeamon in ubuntu's gnome
[02:46] <Doow> Enlightened even
[02:46] <soundray> notwist: at least one other person has experienced your problem: http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-186.html

[02:46] <soundray> notwist: have you found the c't link, too?

[02:47] <prestosd> i had to reboot cuz ctrl alt backspace didnt do anything
[02:47] <soundray> notwist: the nice people at c't have installed SuSE on your model. It's not on the web though
[02:47] <soundray> notwist: no need, I'm fluent in German ;)
[02:47] <Znortfl> Good afternoon. If I want to update my software packets, the update manager says I have to upgrade my distro. However I already upgraded to Edgy Eft. How could I possibly upgrade more? :S
[02:47] <prestosd> and now my resolution is really low!!! URG

[02:49] <vector_sum> Hi folks.. I have the problem that GtkFileDialog *allways* displays hidden files, and I don't want it too
[02:49] <soundray> notwist: they mention in passing that this laptop has a builtin RAID... is that correct?
[02:49] <vector_sum> I suspect it is some configuration issue but I have no idea where to look
[02:50] <jrib> vector_sum: usually it remembers how it was last time.  You can right click and uncheck "show hidden files"
[02:50] <prestosd> same error as I had when we started

=== [ex] hungry-hobo is now known as watson540
[02:50] <notwist> soundray: i think it might, but there is only 1 HDD. I tried installing RAID drivers in windows but no change, not even upgrading from xp > vista inside the now installed XP
[02:50] <vector_sum> thanx :-) I
[02:50] <vector_sum> will try that

[02:51] <prestosd> i think
[02:51] <vector_sum> thanks a lot, bye
[02:51] <soundray> notwist: I may have that printed article about SuSE and your laptop. Let me check my library ;)
[02:51] <kdefrysk> prestosd, I know , but we all get frustrated sometimes ;)
[02:51] <prestosd> lol, k, sorry
[02:51] <RASMAN> julip, your alsa sound module is snd_via82xx
[02:51] <prestosd> thought you knew.....
[02:51] <prestosd> should i pastebin my xorg.conf???
[02:51] <RASMAN> julip, have you been able to get any sound to work?
[02:52] <julip> no
[02:52] <kdefrysk> prestosd, put your xorg.conf in pastebin
[02:52] <prestosd> k
[02:52] <kdefrysk> prestosd, time for the good ol'manual labour ;p

[02:54] <Angryelf_> which arch should I be using for a Pentium M?
[02:54] <prestosd> my xorg.conf
[02:54] <ragamuffin> I am going to install ubuntu on a system which have Win XP on the primary prtition (just installed)
[02:54] <shape> i can't find it?
[02:54] <ragamuffin> I have set apart a partition for ubuntu
[02:54] <soundray> notwist: still here?
[02:54] <notwist> soundray: yep
[02:55] <notwist> soundray: any idea why the HDD isnt being detected?
[02:55] <jrib> shape: did you go to the restricted wiki page and read about Real Media?
[02:55] <phlasphy> how do i install a .deb file on my HDD
[02:55] <jrib> !deb  | phlasphy
[02:55] <ubotu> phlasphy: deb is the Debian package format, also used by Ubuntu. To install .deb files, simply double-click on them (Ubuntu) or right-click and select Kubuntu Package Menu->install (Kubuntu)
[02:55] <soundray> notwist: it's got something to do with the RAID thing. Have you had a look at the BIOS setup?
[02:55] <kdefrysk> prestosd, I see nothing wrong with that xorg.conf
[02:55] <prestosd> drat
[02:55] <phlasphy> thanks
[02:55] <kdefrysk> do glxinfo | grep direct
[02:56] <prestosd> k
[02:56] <kdefrysk> and tell me what it says
[02:56] <notwist> soundray: theres not much to do in the bios, ive only seen stuff about changing the boot order and things like that
[02:56] <soundray> notwist: it's possible that you have to deactivate RAID and that it'll work then
[02:56] <notwist> soundray: ill whip it out and look
[02:56] <ragamuffin> I will go to a less crowded channel, i think
[02:56] <Pupeno> Does Ubuntu graphicall installer suport Reiserfs ?

[02:56] <prestosd> as when we started
[02:56] <kdefrysk> tell me again
[02:57] <jrib> ragamuffin: just write out your quesiton/problem in a single line and if someone knows how to help, they will try
[02:57] <prestosd> oh wait, i just got a pop up
[02:57] <prestosd> its a program crash detected: glxinfo !!!
[02:57] <kdefrysk> geez
[02:57] <notwist> soundray: it only has a "boot" section, nothing there, "security" with bios passwords, "power" with some battery stuff and "exit"
[02:57] <notwist> soundray: thats all :(
[02:57] <kdefrysk> prestosd, is that card still ok ?
[02:57] <sobersabre> Hi, I am trying to use gnome's "about me" pictures.
[02:57] <sobersabre> What image type/size shall I use ?
[02:58] <prestosd> video card you mean?
[02:58] <kdefrysk> or is it likely to be broken ?
[02:58] <prestosd> dunno
[02:58] <kdefrysk> prestosd, yes
[02:58] <prestosd> but it used to work perfect
[02:58] <kdefrysk> prestosd, I really dont know whats wrong
[02:58] <prestosd> on ubuntu 6.06
[02:58] <prestosd> it worked
[02:58] <prestosd> drat
[02:59] <ragamuffin> Can somebody suggest a less crowded help channel for me? I tried Indian ubuntu channel, but nobody is active there.
[02:59] <kdefrysk> prestosd, we still have to adjust your resolution
[02:59] <prestosd> yah
[02:59] <kdefrysk> what is your preferred resolution prestosd ?
[02:59] <prestosd> should i just add them to xorg.conf
[02:59] <prestosd> ive done that before
[02:59] <soundray> notwist: in the amilo-forum thread, they go on to find that the guy's laptop had faulty RAM. That's no help then.
[02:59] <notwist> soundray: my ram seems fine, it says 1024 mb in the bios
[02:59] <kdefrysk> prestosd, yes in the dept 24 line it needs to be added
[02:59] <notwist> soundray: and the only problem is not detecting the HDD in setups for different OS
[03:00] <Atmospherian> notwist: run memtest86 from the ubuntu cd
[03:00] <prestosd> i know
[03:00] <kdefrysk> prestosd, I would stay with the generic nv card
[03:00] <soundray> notwist: no need to run memtest86 right now.
[03:00] <soundray> notwist: your problem is not RAM related afai can tell
[03:00] <kdefrysk> prestosd, it seems to me the card has had its best time
[03:00] <notwist> im pretty sure of that too
[03:00] <prestosd> lol
[03:00] <kdefrysk> so use the nv driver , uses less resources
[03:01] <kdefrysk> also less rendering but hey what can you do
[03:01] <prestosd> how do i use the nv driver?!
[03:01] <kdefrysk> prestosd, change nvidia to nv
[03:01] <notwist> soundray: http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/Resources/59/562938810.pdf
[03:01] <prestosd> in what?
[03:01] <canute> Is it normal to get horrible performance with an ATI card? I get like 20-30 fps at 1024*800 in Sauerbraten. Latest driver.
[03:01] <notwist> soundray: it says it has raid for improved performance, but in the GUI in XP it says i have one harddrive :/
[03:01] <kdefrysk> but you have no more 3d driver then
[03:02] <prestosd> i guess thats okay
[03:02] <prestosd> but where do i change nvidia to nv?
[03:02] <kdefrysk> prestosd, did you recently install another kernel without rebooting or something ?
[03:02] <prestosd> ??????I don't think so??????
[03:02] <soundray> notwist: it's probably configured as a single RAID partition. In that case Windows would "see" only one drive.
[03:02] <kdefrysk> just wondering
[03:02] <prestosd> k
[03:02] <prestosd> oh
[03:03] <notwist> soundray: i see "controller 0" going to "channel 0" (channel 1,2 are inactive) and under chan0 i see "Master"
[03:03] <kdefrysk> sound if you have x running you might as well leave it as it is
[03:03] <prestosd> what resolution comes after 1024x768
[03:03] <kdefrysk> 1280x1024
[03:03] <soundray> notwist: where?
[03:03] <prestosd> its 1115 or something???i cant remember now lol
[03:03] <notwist> soundray: in the windows GUI that came with the driver
[03:03] <prestosd> its not 1280
[03:04] <notwist> soundray: i mean, shouldnt it show two disks if i had raid
[03:04] <WildChild> Is there a way to stick a network driver to an interface name? I am cloning machines and on the cloned one, upon boot, eth0 gets renamed to eth1 and ath0 to ath1. Thanks
[03:04] <prestosd> its before 1280
[03:04] <prestosd> but after 1024, lol
[03:04] <prestosd> nevermind, ill go find out, i know how
[03:04] <kdefrysk> 1152x864
[03:05] <soundray> notwist: I don't know, it depends on how the controller presents the disk(s) to the OS
[03:05] <prestosd> Yah thats it!
[03:05] <KenSentMe> How can i see what bandwith my network connection is using from cli?
[03:05] <bayzider> Hey I got a problem when I click on my frostwire or limewire icon nothing happens, whats wrong?
[03:05] <notwist> soundray: well.. yeah. but it's wierd as hell that i cant see anything about RAID in the bios
[03:06] <kdefrysk> prestosd, and further I would not bother too much with that old card
[03:06] <KenSentMe> bayzider: run the apps from command line and see if there are any errors
[03:06] <kdefrysk> its just.....old......
=== rooter is now known as rootpt
[03:06] <prestosd> lol
[03:06] <soundray> notwist: can you find out anything about the hard disk controller, like a chipset name?
[03:06] <prestosd> im ALWAYS using old stuff!
[03:06] <bayzider> Kensentme: how do I do that?
[03:06] <prestosd> but I should have a computer im building running soon

[03:11] <bayzider> Kensentme: the terminal just opens and closes imediatly
[03:11] <KenSentMe> bayzider: no errors?
[03:11] <delphiuk> hi, is their a package i can install for the lamp server?
[03:11] <bayzider> kensentme: I didnt have this problem before I upgraded. What happens is the temrinal opens and closes imeditaly
[03:11] <notwist> soundray: any success?
[03:11] <notwist> soundray: brb
[03:12] <delphiuk> or, is there a way that I can force a lamp server install from the server cd?
[03:12] <soundray> notwist: only other people with the same issue
[03:12] <KenSentMe> bayzider: i wouldn't know what the real problem is, sorry
[03:12] <bayzider> Does any one elese know whats going on???????
[03:12] <vbgunz> Anybody here have my burn issue? the burn comes out fine but the file names in Windows are truncated? If not, can you paste your /etc/fstab line that corresponds to your burner drive?
[03:13] <soundray> vbgunz: use a program that lets you make a DVD with Joliet extensions. I reckon nautilus uses RockRidge- (unix-)extensions instead

[03:27] <Spawn311> i386
[03:27] <jrib> vbgunz: yes, you have to save it.  You can call it whatever you want but it's not a shell script so .sh isn't a good description
[03:27] <raija_> Great I have lots of them...
[03:27] <Ice_Wewe> Atmospherian: network-manager doesn't see my wireless connection, and I know no way of adding one manually
[03:27] <Ice_Wewe> bayzider: run Limewire in wine, it's easier
[03:28] <vbgunz> jrib: so copy and paste all contents into a text file? I can call it nautilus.patch if I want?
[03:28] <Atmospherian> Ice_Wewe: what kind of wireless card is it?
[03:28] <GnarusLeo> What is "composite"? Like when I use fglrx and so on? I have it disabled, is that bad?

[03:28] <jrib> vbgunz: yep
[03:28] <Atmospherian> Ice_Wewe: do you have the correct drivers, etc?
[03:28] <Ice_Wewe> soundray: is this because Edgy uses dash instead of bash?

[03:34] <Spawn311> Ice_Wewe: did you look in all the repositorys on synaptic?
[03:34] <prestosd> LOL
[03:34] <jrib> vbgunz: np
[03:34] <bingnet> no
[03:34] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: ues
[03:34] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: yes*
[03:34] <Spawn311> very strange
[03:34] <kdefrysk> prestosd, in the settings of gnome you can set the screenresolution
[03:34] <prestosd> HEY! I didn't know there was an autocomplete button!!
[03:34] <bingnet> i didn't install pax before last boot.
[03:34] <prestosd> where?
[03:34] <kdefrysk> prestosd, the tab button does that
[03:34] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: have you checked to see if your home partition is full, can you write to your home directory? Those are problems I've run into that have prevented me from logging in
[03:35] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: yes

[03:35] <prestosd> i went to preferences screen res
[03:35] <slew> hi, how do i change the default port for the bit torrent program that comes with gnome?
[03:35] <pdkl> there an upgrade path from SuSE 9.3 to ubuntu?
[03:35] <tw1991> cause on freenode they say i can't whisper lol
[03:35] <raghu206> jrib, http://pastebin.com/826619
[03:35] <prestosd> and all it has is 1024!!!
[03:35] <jucs> If you cannot set it there, you'll have to edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:35] <prestosd> URG
[03:35] <Ice_Wewe> jucs: that will only list the possible resolutions as defined in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. If you're trying to add more, you have to edit that file manually
[03:35] <soundray> pdkl: no, you have to reinstall
[03:35] <bingnet> Ice_Wewe: I checked, /dev/hda1 is not nearly full, and I can rw to that part
[03:35] <Ice_Wewe> prestosd: read what I just told jucs
[03:35] <raghu206> Ice_Wewe, http://pastebin.com/826619
[03:36] <kdefrysk> prestosd, did you restart x after the resolution added to xorg.conf ?
[03:36] <Spawn311> Icw_wewe: it might be the fact that your card is not compatibile with ndiswrapper 1.0
[03:36] <prestosd> kdefrysk, yes
[03:36] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: can you log into tty and touch a file?
[03:36] <soundray> Ice_Wewe: ndiswrapper cannot work on ppc
[03:36] <kdefrysk> then it should be in the resolutionsbit in gnome
[03:36] <Spawn311> mine was not and I had to use ndiswrapper 1.8 - but since that is not in the synaptic repository you might be out of luck'
[03:36] <kdefrysk> prestosd, make sure you added it correctly in xorg.conf
[03:36] <Ice_Wewe> soundray: I've already tried wifi-radar, what other drivers are there out there?
[03:36] <pdkl> we have about 10 ish opteron servers that I like to remove suse 9.3 from, im looking for ideas on migration of
[03:36] <Spawn311> oh crap
[03:36] <soundray> kdefrysk: may need to adapt the monitor settings
[03:37] <prestosd> kdefrysk, ill check

[03:37] <Ice_Wewe> raghu206: I don't know... see if you can reconfigure them in synaptic
[03:37] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: yes, most people don't understand that...
[03:37] <kdefrysk> soundray, true but dpkg-reconfigure usually probes the monitor
[03:37] <soundray> kdefrysk: maybe the monitor isn't capable then
[03:37] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: glad you realised so quickly, most others don't. They're asking me if I've enabled it in BIOS, etc.
[03:37] <kdefrysk> soundray, true
[03:38] <jrib> raghu206: make sure you don't already have those lines in /etc/apt/sources.list.  If you don't, then just add " universe" to the end of the 3rd line in the file you pasted and run 'sudo apt-get update'
[03:38] <kdefrysk> prestosd, please repastebin your xorg.conf :s
[03:38] <bingnet> Ice: What is touch? I was able to login to command-line console from regular login screen and updated /etc/fstab and some cron scripts.

[03:39] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[03:39] <Spawn311> Ice_wewe: did u try google ppc <your model num> ubuntu and see if anyone else has your issue
[03:39] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: touch is used to update the date header of a file, you can also use it to make sure you have write permissions in a directory... ex. 'touch junk' will create an empty file called 'junk' in that folder. It's a handy test to make sure you have write, and the partition isn't full
[03:39] <slew> how do i change the default port for the bit torrent program that comes with gnome?
[03:39] <Ice_Wewe> Spawn311: apart from the How-To's, no

[03:40] <bingnet> Ice: thanks for the tip, I definitely have the ability to touch files on root part
[03:40] <Ice_Wewe> ok
[03:40] <bingnet> Ice: and the disk is not full
[03:40] <raghu206> jrib, ok it worked thanks
[03:40] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: do you know what errors you're getting?
[03:41] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: because if it were an X-server configuration problem, you could use dpkg to revert the X-server settings to default
[03:41] <jrib> raghu206: np, consider filing a bug as I saw a similar situation with gnome-app-install the other day
[03:41] <kdefrysk> prestosd, now really check your resolutions in your xorg.conf and fix it !!
[03:41] <bingnet> Ice: dmesg shows nothing, there is no error displayed when the x login fails
[03:41] <kdefrysk> prestosd, you made a numerical typo!!
[03:41] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: if it were a .Xauthority problem, you could rename (or delete, but I don't reccomend that) that file, and see if it sovles the problem
[03:41] <prestosd> ???????????//
[03:41] <prestosd> kdefrysk, where?
[03:41] <prestosd> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32326/
[03:41] <prestosd> updated
[03:42] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: ok, try moving .Xauthority to .Xauthority_old, and try to log in

[03:42] <prestosd> LOL
[03:42] <prestosd> i know
[03:42] <bingnet> Ice: what is the effect of doing that? I mean what is the purpose of that file?
[03:42] <prestosd> i was changing it when you asked my to pastbin
[03:42] <prestosd> view the updated version: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32326/
[03:42] <kmaynard> 1280x1024  ftw
[03:42] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: I'm not really sure, but I've had problems with the X-server before, and moving that file has helped
[03:42] <kdefrysk> prestosd, the rest is fine , restart x and try again
[03:43] <bayzider> How do you make a play list in gtkpod?
[03:43] <kdefrysk> kmaynard, no
[03:43] <prestosd> lol, why? I've restarted 2wice already!
[03:43] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: catting hte one I have in Dapper, it appears to be like a cookie for the Xserver
[03:43] <Svip> :S My system did a sys upgrade, and now X won't start.
[03:43] <kdefrysk> you just changed it prestosd
[03:43] <prestosd> no i didnt
[03:43] <kdefrysk> to get it to go you need to restart x
[03:43] <prestosd> i just changed the pastebin
[03:43] <prestosd> not the real thing
[03:43] <prestosd> i havent saved it yet
[03:44] <kdefrysk> well fix it save it and restart x
[03:44] <bingnet> ok, I'll give that a try next time I'm at the console. Thanks ICE! I'm going to repost my ? in case someone else has a clue.
[03:44] <Ice_Wewe> prestosd: instead of restarting to try and apply another resolution, just do 'ctrl + alt + backspace' to restart the Xserver
[03:44] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: are you running Dapper, or Edgy?
[03:44] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: I guess the more important question is, are you using development branches, or stable branches?
[03:44] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: ok
[03:44] <bingnet> Hello channel, here is my ubuntu edgy ?:  I've been using edgy for the last week without any major problem, but this morning I am unable to login using X. Boot appears normal, login screen appears normal, when I enter my credentials authentication is successful (login failed message works if I use wrong pw), and the cursor then changes to busy, then the login screen reappears! I tried failsafe, gnome, kde, xfce, and console only. Only console works. I ch
[03:44] <prestosd> LOL, i did fix it! The only error was on the pastebin! that error wasnt on the actual thing
[03:44] <Svip> EE: Failed to load module "DRI"  (does not exist) \\ EE: Module ABI major version (0) doesn't match the server's version \\ EE: Failed to load module "i810"
[03:44] <prestosd> Ice_Wewe, i know
[03:45] <Svip> Ice_Wewe:  My system claims to be Edgy.
[03:45] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: another thing is that you could try moving your home directory to say user_old, and make a new one, and see if that solves it
[03:45] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: do you know if you're using stable, or development mirrors?
[03:45] <kdefrysk> prestosd, I see
[03:45] <prestosd> kdefrysk, lol, good
[03:45] <bingnet> will try
[03:45] <Svip> I've haven't changed with the sources, so I assume they are stable.

[03:48] <CientificoLoco> LjL, ah, ok thanks

[03:49] <prestosd> Ive seen a lierox player with the name LjL
[03:49] <LjL> kill them

[03:49] <prestosd> slowly
[03:49] <prestosd> >:D
[03:49] <prestosd> gtg
[03:50] <kdefrysk> prestosd, my advise is : rerun sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg , do defaults , exept for screenresolutions, tic your desired resolution there and when done restart x and leave it be in peace ;)
[03:50] <kdefrysk> he just left :s
[03:50] <Svip> Ah.
[03:50] <zhangyangang> #debian
[03:51] <raghu206> my apt-get  updating stops after a while.Getting struck at point "waiting for headers"how to solve this
[03:51] <kmaynard> raghu206, take the us. off of your repos
[03:51] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: try what kdefrysk suggested to prestosd
[03:51] <raghu206> kmaynard, u mean ..?
[03:52] <kdefrysk> Ice_Wewe, he just left
[03:52] <kdefrysk> oh this is another x problematic person
[03:52] <Ice_Wewe> kdefrysk: yeah, bit Svip is still here, and has an X server problem
[03:52] <Ice_Wewe> kdefrysk: yup ;)
[03:52] <kmaynard> raghu206, vi /etc/apt/sources.list   if your repositories start with  'us.'  remove that, then update...sometimes it helps
[03:52] <kdefrysk> we need a fix-x team !!!!
[03:52] <Ice_Wewe> kdefrysk: now if only I had someone else with a Broadcom wireless problem, then I wouldn't feel so alone in this world
[03:53] <CientificoLoco> LjL, I cannot convert wma to mp3 the most similiar is wav but it said me that, it can not find the file
[03:53] <Ice_Wewe> kdefrysk: I'm not regreting not upgrading to Edgy... Dapper is still the best choice. Edgy on 64bit has a broken USB driver (uses up all the CPU time, won't release ports for use...)
[03:53] <Ice_Wewe> kdefrysk: well, I'm about to give up and reboot into OS X (on my laptop)
[03:53] <kdefrysk> ooh
[03:53] <Svip> That fixed it, Ice_Wewe.
[03:54] <Svip> Just had to install the new i810 driver from the source list.
[03:54] <kdefrysk> 64bit is not my thing luckily
=== knoppix is now known as Free
[03:54] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: thank kdefrysk, he's the one that suggested it (although I did give that advice to someone else a while back)
[03:54] <Ice_Wewe> Svip: ok
[03:54] <vbgunz> jrib: heh, I read up and think I know the basics of patching outside the plethora of options... my question is, how in the world do i figure out the exact file to patch?
=== Free is now known as Fik
[03:54] <Ice_Wewe> wow, I'm guessing someone running Knoppix is having problems with their Ubuntu, so much so, that they can't get it running enough to run xchat... ;)
[03:54] <jrib> vbgunz: it's in the first couple of lines of your patch file
[03:55] <vbgunz> jrib: yeah, thats what I thought... *but* I don't think so :(
[03:55] <vbgunz> --- src/make-iso.c
[03:55] <vbgunz> +++ src/make-iso.c
[03:55] <Ice_Wewe> so, anyone here a PPC head, or know a PPC head? cause I'm about to give up... I haven't had wireless the entire time Edgy's been in development, and even now that it's stable, I don't have wireless
[03:56] <jrib> vbgunz: right, you don't have that file in nautilus-cd-burner-2.17.1/ ?
[03:56] <vbgunz> I don't have a src/make-iso.c OR a make-iso.c... I looked and looked for it... I do have a /usr/src/...
[03:56] <jrib> vbgunz: the patch applies to source code
[03:56] <mumbles> Ice_Wewe wireless on a laptop ?
[03:56] <codeshepherd> how do i force networkmanager to use ipv4 ?
[03:56] <vbgunz> jrib: one sec
[03:57] <Ice_Wewe> mumbles: yeah, PowerBook G4 with Broadcom 4318 (aka "AirForceOne")
[03:57] <silensius> how can i close on my kubuntu edgy port 631 and 22 ?
[03:57] <silensius> or is it possible to put in stealth mode
[03:57] <vbgunz> jrib: ahh, I have to build nautilus from src then apply it? hmm, I missed it...
[03:58] <CientificoLoco> LjL, I cannot convert wma to mp3 the most similiar is wav but it said me that, it can not find the file
[03:58] <LjL> CientificoLoco, have you installed the recommends? ffmpeg specifically
[03:58] <jrib> vbgunz: well you apply the patch first, then build :)
[03:59] <LjL> there's also a bunch of suggests
[03:59] <mbmorri2> anyone here have madwifi-ng working under edgy eft?
[03:59] <Ice_Wewe> mbmorri2: what arch?
[03:59] <CientificoLoco> LjL, how can I know it?
[03:59] <mbmorri2> i386
[03:59] <LjL> CientificoLoco: just install it. sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
[03:59] <neewbie> is it hard ti install/unistall ubuntu??
[03:59] <vbgunz> jrib: I just did: sudo apt-get build-dep nautilus... where will all these source files go? will they go to /usr/src?
[03:59] <Ice_Wewe> mbmorri2: then no, I have a PPC problem
[03:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell neewbie about install
[04:00] <Ice_Wewe> neewbie: depends on how advanced you are
[04:00] <jrib> vbgunz: no where, that just installs the dependencies you need to build the package.  Try 'apt-get source nautilus-cd-burner'
[04:00] <Ice_Wewe> neewbie: I'd say no, but then again, I've been using linux for over 7 years...
[04:00] <mbmorri2> ice_wewe: you having trouble getting it going under a PPC build?
[04:00] <jrib> vbgunz: also, note that the patch is for a different version than what edgy has.  The code may or may not conflict
[04:00] <CientificoLoco> LjL, I have  installed
[04:00] <neewbie> I have never used Linux before:S
[04:01] <vbgunz> jrib: yeah, I think I am going to relax on it then... really, I don't want to screw it up :P
[04:01] <LjL> CientificoLoco: then close and reopen soundkonverter and try again. if that still doesn't work, i'd start looking at the suggests: lame and mplayer
[04:01] <vbgunz> jrib: but I learn something and I thank you for your time very much, you were very helpful!
[04:01] <Ice_Wewe> mbmorri2: no, I'm having trouble with getting Edgy to realise that I have a wireless card...
[04:01] <mbmorri2> ohhh, airport extreme?
[04:01] <Ice_Wewe> mbmorri2: I'm not even at the configuration stage yet
[04:02] <Ice_Wewe> mbmorri2: yes, if you dare to call it "Extreme", I just call it crummy
[04:02] <Morrissey> Hi! Has anyone managed to get "Second Life" to run smoothly in ubuntu? My 3D drivers should be fine (ppracer works great!), and I have a ATI 9000, and a 1,5ghz Pentium. But still its almost impossible to do stuff with the character, and it seems as if my computer is about about to explode :)
[04:02] <mbmorri2> lol, i know what you mean. i've used kismac on a powerbook, what a complete waste
[04:03] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: is that a native linux binary?
[04:03] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, its a alpha
[04:03] <Chousuke> mbmorri2: I used kismac on my powerbook. I got a kernel panic.
[04:03] <jrib> vbgunz: the code change /looks/ simple enough.  You could always try and if it doesn't work just reinstall the original package
[04:04] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: ok, the 9000 series is a) pretty old, and b) wasn't that great, but if you're sure you have accleration, then I'd say that your CPU is too slow... what r the system requirements for Second Life?
[04:04] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: please beware that you're talking to a die-hard NVidia fanboy
[04:04] <carlo> I need help, I've just installed Ubuntu 6.10, and I can't change the refresh rate at any screen resolution
[04:04] <carlo> It's fixed at 85hz
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, it says 800 ghz (and it recommends some ATI 8000 card)
[04:05] <vbgunz> jrib: I've been working on some home movies all week. I've got them only on the hard drive and don't want to screw anything up... I do need to burn them though and get them off... I'll try k3b, I sort of liked it but liked nautilus being much simpler... just it doesn't support the joliet extension :(
[04:05] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: but apart from telling you to get an Nvidia card, I'll try to help
[04:05] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: you mean 800Mhz?
[04:05] <neewbie> I've heard that you get problems when you have dualboot, and uninstall ubuntu
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, that would be great :)
[04:05] <CientificoLoco> LjL, no, it does not work
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, hehe, yeah
[04:05] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I'm not sure that an 800Ghz computer exsists in an affordable format
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, my ATI just came with my laptop, have no opinion on ATI vs. Nvidia or whatever
[04:05] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: what did you use to install it?
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, that would be nice though
[04:05] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, nothing, just ./secondlife
[04:06] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: Apple likes ATi, which is part of the reason I hate them
[04:06] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: but enough about my prejudice
[04:06] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: where did you download this from?
[04:06] <Ice_Wewe> anyone know the flag to get glxgears to tell you the FPS?
[04:06] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, from theyr homepage
[04:07] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times ...
[04:07] <Morrissey> glxinfo | grep rendering gave me 'yes' Ice_Wewe

[04:09] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: ok, so then I'd assume that there is something in the SL prefs that is a) limiting the FPS, or b) SL requires something a bit more than what you system can offer

[04:11] <Morrissey> CientificoLoco, Ive seen him 4 times :)
[04:11] <tahorg> anyone here's got mysql5 running on amd64 (edgy)
[04:11] <tahorg> ?
[04:11] <tahorg> it's awfully broken
[04:11] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: how much of that is free when you're running SL?
[04:11] <jshriver> Anyone know if phpmyadmin has any logging abilities?
[04:11] <ccooke> bingnet: ok. can you see what you .xsession-errors contains?
[04:11] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, how would I know?
[04:12] <CientificoLoco> Morrissey, Ive seen him once, but it was amaizing and I won the shirt he trought
[04:12] <bingnet> ccooke: where can I see that please?
[04:12] <Morrissey> CientificoLoco, oh, you should put it on ebay :) very good for you
[04:12] <Morrissey> thanks so far Ice_Wewe
[04:12] <CientificoLoco> Morrissey, no, I want just for me..!
[04:12] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: run SL, and in another terminal, type 'free' and tell me what it says under the 'free' column for memory and swap
[04:12] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, Im starting to think that my laptop just dont bear up to SL reqs :)
[04:12] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, ok, two seconds
[04:13] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times ...
[04:13] <ccooke> bingnet: log in to the console and type 'tail .xsession-errors'
[04:14] <Morrissey> wow Ice_Wewe  ... 9012 left on mem :(
[04:14] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I suspect that you don't have enough RAM. I use my full 2GB when I'm playing a game like BF2
[04:14] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: and are you using any swap?
[04:14] <Morrissey> yes, about 174
[04:14] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: ok, I'd say that you need more memory
[04:14] <slavik> any ideas?
[04:14] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, I would agree
[04:15] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: without going into a long and slightly offtopic story about Halo on my PowerBook, I'd say more RAM is needed
[04:15] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: 1.5Ghz P4 laptop, what kind of RAM does that thing take?
[04:15] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, I should get more ram for my laptop ... how would I know wich RAM to buy= Its a hp pavilion zt3000
[04:15] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, my q exacly :)
[04:15] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, its a centrino :)
[04:15] <Morrissey> I will order my ram right away
[04:15] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I'm checking for you
[04:16] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: looks nice, BTW
[04:16] <Morrissey> thanks Ice_Wewe  :)
[04:16] <Morrissey> its about a year old I think ..
[04:17] <Morrissey> maybe some more
[04:17] <jshriver> Anyone know if phpmyadmin has the ability to log accesses, or any type of logging?
[04:17] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: ok, so going by information from PC Mag, and sellers on eBay (I take what info I can get), you're laptop takes DDR2700, 200pin SODIMM
[04:18] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: your laptop should have 2 slots
[04:18] <Durtro> hello
[04:18] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I'm not sure if both of them are used, with 128MB, I'd doubt it
[04:18] <warlock-> I have 2 ips on my server, can this somehow screw apache up?
[04:18] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: maximum capacity: 2GB
[04:18] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, you mean 2x256?
[04:18] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=160049985411&ih=006&category=80202&rd=1
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: that explains the RAM type (don't get it from eBay)
[04:19] <eneried> hello boys
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: what about the girls in this room?
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> (of which I am not)
[04:19] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, ok, thanks! I will look into some norwegian stores
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: your computer can handle 1GB stick per slot
[04:19] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, great!
[04:19] <Lynoure> Are there backported kernels (2.6.17) for dapper, or do I have to roll my own?
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: however, I think that 1GB would be a nice upgrade from 128MB
[04:19] <Ice_Wewe> Lynoure: start rolling
[04:20] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, oh .. sorry, I have 128 on my ATI card, 512 of computer RAM :)
[04:20] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: oh, ok
[04:20] <Morrissey> but still ..
[04:20] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: well, with 9MB free, and using <150MB of swap, I'd consider investing in more
[04:20] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I use the full 2GB on my PC
[04:20] <eneried> i need a little help, i upgraded my ubuntu dappper to ubuntu edgy, but doing it in a... um, strange way, so, my ubuntu is working but lacking of some packages, like the clock on the tray, could somebody tell me what packages i  must have??
[04:20] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, exacly .. I will
[04:20] <slavik> what is the /dev entry for a usb flash drive?
[04:21] <Morrissey> I just have to find out if Im using both slots, hope not!
[04:21] <Morrissey> thanks Ice_Wewe !
[04:21] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: didn't you read the /. article? You *don't* want to do that, aparntally
[04:21] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: no problem, good luck!
[04:21] <eneried> slavik if the flash is mounted ask for mtab
[04:21] <slavik> eneried: it's not getting mounted
[04:21] <eneried> huh
[04:21] <minimec> eneried: gnome, xfce or kde?
[04:22] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: start synaptic
[04:22] <eneried> Ice_Wewe, i didn't read that
[04:22] <slavik> eneried: my usb drive is not getting mounted
[04:22] <eneried> ok, I have synaptic opened
[04:22] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: do a search for "Package provides" and paste this '/usr/lib/gnome-panel/clock-applet'
[04:22] <Doow> hmm.. when I get rtfm! I don't expect to be slashdot ^^
[04:22] <pirast> hi i am having troubles using compiz. i installed the newest nvidia driver from nvidia.com with GLX_EXT_PIXMAP and installed the package desktop effects. but when i enable the desktop effects, window borders disappear. when i start a new applications, there are some effects, but the windows bordner does not appear, either.
[04:22] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: and hope it comes up with something that isn't already installed
[04:23] <eneried> slavik, i dont' know then the mount point, let me check using mine, (but i need to find it before)
[04:23] <eneried> Ice_Wewe, i think there's something not installed, but i don't know the name of those packages
[04:23] <minimec> eneried: If you use gnome, look for the package ubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-standard
[04:23] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: unless this is a 9*** series driver (which is considered BETA at best) why didn't you use the driver that comes with the Ubuntu kernel?
[04:23] <Animal> Can somebody tell me how to unistall Ubuntu, I've hard that you most do something with Grub
[04:23] <eneried> let me check
[04:23] <eneried> ubuntu-desktop was not installed!
[04:23] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: right, by doing what I described in synaptic, you should find out what you need to install, or reinstall
[04:23] <minimec> eneried: ;)
[04:24] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: install that, see if it helps
[04:24] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, because of the GLX_EXT_PIXMAP support. 9xxx is stable: http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
[04:24] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: wow, a lot happens in 2 weeks
[04:25] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: when I last checked their site, 9*** was beta
[04:25] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: thanks for that
[04:25] <eneried> Ice_Wewe, it seems this is the problem, i selected it and appeared a lot of packages to install, but i don't want one of those packages... the gaim, i don't like gaim 2, i preffer to keep on gaim 1.5 how can i do it?
[04:25] <alxandra> how can i change the kernel that i am using? please show me something to read
[04:25] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: I don't know, sorry.
[04:25] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, it's somewhat funny.. the select menu only shows the 8xxx one.. the link that i gave you shows the 9xxx one.. but it is stable now afaik
[04:25] <eneried> ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-minimal are installed, :)
[04:25] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: you can download the gaim 1.5 deb, and force install it afterwards
[04:26] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: ok, is it stable?
[04:26] <minimec> eneried: Install them all. Then you have the normal gnome desktop. If you don't like some packages uninstall them afterwards
[04:26] <eneried> ok, then i install 2.0, and after 2.0 i'll go back to old gaim :)
[04:26] <minimec> eneried: exactly.
[04:26] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times ... USB drive does not get automounted.
[04:26] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, no crashes at all ;-)
[04:26] <Ice_Wewe> eneried: make sure you can find a deb before you do that
[04:27] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: is this on edgy, or dapper?
[04:27] <bingnet> thanks, CCOOKE. I will take a look. I'm going to repost my ? in case another has any clue.
[04:27] <Finsta1> Hey guys, I got a question. It's a very odd case
[04:27] <bingnet> Hello channel, here is my ubuntu edgy ?:  I've been using edgy for the last week without any major problem, but this morning I am unable to login using X. Boot appears normal, login screen appears normal, when I enter my credentials authentication is successful (login failed message works if I use wrong pw), and the cursor then changes to busy, then the login screen reappears! I tried failsafe, gnome, kde, xfce, and console only. Only console works. I ch
[04:27] <Ice_Wewe> Finsta1: ask away
[04:27] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, the problem appearsi n edgy and feisty, but I am currently running feisty. I had to install the NVIDIA driver manually..
[04:27] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: what, is Feisty?
[04:28] <minimec> eneried: remeber... When you uninstall gaim2, that will uninstall the ubuntu-standard package too ;) So when you do the update to feisty, you will have the same problem with some packages missing ;)
[04:28] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, Ubuntu development releease
[04:28] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: oh lovely... tell them to stop making another, till they fix Edgy!
[04:28] <bingnet> Is it possible to downgrade edgy > dapper?
[04:28] <alxandra> could someone please tell me how to change kernel ??
[04:29] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: I don't know, sorry. I'm stuck using Dapper for stability reasons. Edgy has a busted USB module on x86_64, and I don't feel like compiling a kernel
[04:29] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: are you on Edgy? If so, what arch?
[04:29] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, argh! that's bad.. sorry for you
[04:29] <minimec> alxandra: Install the kernel you want and press <esc> when the grub-line appears when booting
[04:29] <alxandra> Ice_Wewe i am using edgy and generic kernel
[04:29] <tahorg> edgy is so broken (at least on amd64)
[04:29] <Ice_Wewe> bingnet: not that I know of, besides, why would you want to downgrade? Edgy is perfect (*cough*crummy*cough*)
[04:29] <pirast> I do not have any problems on edgy excepting an ooo issue which hopefully makes it into edgy-updates
[04:29] <alxandra> but it doent supp two cores
[04:29] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: what arch?
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> tahorg: I second that
[04:30] <alxandra> amd64
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> tahorg: it is so messed up
[04:30] <pirast> <Ice_Wewe>
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: there is an SMP kernel
[04:30] <tahorg> Ice_Wewe: eclipse broken. mysql-server broken.
[04:30] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, whats the bug number? I'd like to subscribe to it
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: but we (tahorg and I) are having problems with Edgy on AMD64
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: there is none
[04:30] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: I haven't submitted a bug report
[04:31] <alxandra> <Ice_Wewe> which kernel do you advice me to use?
[04:31] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: if you'd be so kind to point me to a page to file a report, I'd be glad to do so
[04:31] <eneried> bingnet! that sounds very risky, what you could try is going to synaptic, changing the preferred version to dapper, after that force version of some packages to old versions, and having a lot of coffe, a lot of patiente, and no fear to fix some errors from command line
[04:31] <cyberglitch2> is anybody else haveing a problem with updateing universe
[04:31] <sherman> anyone here have any experience getting ethernet to work with an asus p5b-e?
[04:31] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted.
[04:31] <alxandra> i have already installed amd64 version. should i delete it??
[04:31] <cyberglitch2> i keep on getting gzip errors
[04:32] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: well, since lovely Edgy developers think that all x86_64 CPUs are alike, they've kindly deprecated all the specialized kernels for IA64, K8, Opteron, etc.
[04:32] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: the AMD64 version is a dummy package for the generic kernel, which both confuses and enrages me
[04:32] <Ice_Wewe> alxandra: I would try the SMP kernel, but I wouldn't set my hopes very high
[04:32] <darko> hey gys, wondering if someone can walk me thru mountiung my drives
[04:32] <eneried> bingnet, keep on edgy and use some old dapper packages as needed sound better, i did that using dapper, keeping some old but good packages from breezy
[04:32] <globalmatador> Ice_Wewe: you can build your own kernel and benchmark it against the generic kernel :)
[04:32] <tahorg> my mysql just SIGILL
[04:32] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:32] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, existing bug reports in the edgy kernel can be found here: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bugs
[04:33] <tahorg> Ice_Wewe: well it's not a problem, really
[04:33] <cyberglitch2> however when i download the Package.gz file by hand, i dont gave a problem extracting it
[04:33] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, to report a new, click on Report a Bug in the left upper corner there
[04:33] <Ice_Wewe> globalmatador: yup, and then I could have fun spending all day trying to get my NVidia drivers to compile against my custom kernel... pass. I had to do that with Mandrake, which is why I dumped it for Dapper
[04:33] <tahorg> Ice_Wewe: sse3 and stuff aren't usefull at all in a kernel
[04:33] <alxandra> <Ice_Wewe> i read on ubuntuforums that K8 could see both cores. is that possible?
[04:33] <finsta> Sorry about that
[04:33] <finsta> Unstable WiFi
[04:33] <globalmatador> Ice_Wewe: my point is that its not going to be any faster
[04:33] <finsta> So I have a client who wants Ubuntu on their T42
[04:33] <alxandra> i am now booting with noapic. this is annoying
[04:34] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: I haven't verified that the source code contains any problems, but the generic binary sure does
[04:34] <Wipster> hey all recenty tryed to install Edgy 6.10, but the problem is the ATI drivers that are incuded with every release are buged on my card so I cant view the live CD, this is normaly rectified by going into safe graphics mode but this produces the same effect as the normal mode (just a blank screen) I had a look in the boot command and it had a xforcevesa is this correct because the vesa drivers normaly work, any ideas how I can fix this and install?
[04:34] <cyberglitch2> also is that where libdvdcss is?
[04:34] <finsta> I ghost the partition, then resize it but when resizing it duds out and kills it
[04:34] <finsta> Any ideas?
[04:34] <nathansnook7> Is there a problem with python in ubuntu?
[04:34] <Ice_Wewe> globalmatador: and my point is that the generic kernel has wicked bugs that I think an arch specific (ie. tuned to that specific type of CPU) wouldn't have
[04:34] <Bb_TiTi> dites, je viens d'installer ubuntu (il y a 4 jours) et je suis tomb amoureux de xfce. Ma question est: comment passer a xubuntu sans tout rinstaller?
[04:34] <globalmatador> i have an usb wavelan adapter that doesnt work out of the box, its from smc / accton. how can i find out if there is a driver for that?
[04:35] <pirast> <Ice_Wewe>, bug reports against the binary kernel packages also should go against linux-source-2.6.17
[04:35] <darko> need help mountiung my drives
[04:35] <slavik> darko: man mount
[04:35] <finsta> Bb_TiTi, installer les packages pour xfce en synaptic
[04:35] <dxdemetriou> the bug in kernel for edgy you said is fixed?
[04:35] <unfun> What is wine and how do I get it?
[04:35] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:36] <finsta> Et les packets pour Xubuntu, ils sont toutes en Synaptic
[04:36] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: great... I'm registering
[04:36] <pirast> !wine
[04:36] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[04:36] <slavik> unfun: see http://www.winehq.com, instructions are in download section
[04:36] <darko> slavik, what do you mean
[04:36] <slavik> darko: run that in terminal, it will give you the man page
[04:36] <nathansnook7> unfun:  you can go to winehq or try www.codeweavers.com beta is free right now
[04:36] <globalmatador> Ice_Wewe: if there are less different binary packages, it will ultimately result in them being more stable, because they get more testing
[04:36] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, okay, thanks. when you reported it, please provide me with the bug number
[04:36] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:36] <Ice_Wewe> finsta: this is not a french supported channel
[04:37] <jake_> hello, can anybody help with a vmware server issue?
[04:37] <Ice_Wewe> finsta: please join #ubuntu-fr for support in french
[04:37] <finsta> Nah, it was for Bb..
[04:37] <Ice_Wewe> finsta: merci, et bon chance
[04:37] <finsta> Since he asked
[04:37] <pirast> Ice_Wewe, it should also be worth trying the feisty beta cd when it gets released and writing down if it works with it there.
[04:37] <stefania> hi guys
[04:38] <pirast> stefania, hi
[04:38] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: I'll pass on that. My PC is my main desktop, I can't handle it being unstable
[04:38] <finsta> So does anybody have any idea for my issue?
[04:38] <dxdemetriou> jake_, I have found the problem in forum. you must remove some library, but I don't remebmer now
[04:38] <stefania> pirast: hi
[04:38] <jake_> finsta what is your issue?
[04:38] <pirast> <Ice_Wewe>, yeah but you do not have to install it.. just burn the desktop cd then and boot from it
[04:38] <stefania> pirast: i have a question, can you help me?
=== GnarusLeo is now known as Morrissey
[04:38] <alxandra> Ice_Wewe could you please give me a link to read to get further inf. about changing kernel?
[04:38] <pirast> stefania, shoot
[04:38] <eneried> finsta, what your problem is?
[04:39] <Keyseir> I'm repeatedly getting "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" on firefox. I reinstalled and it worked for a few days no problems, but I just tried to open it and it started messing up again. I'm running edgy.
[04:39] <dxdemetriou> jake_, I found it. sudo apt-get remove libdbus-1-2
[04:39] <HeathenDan> yikes, a xorg update in the repos... i think i'll sit this out for a few days
[04:39] <eneried> finsta, i think you want to install xubuntu, i'm ok?
[04:39] <Keyseir> I'm repeatedly getting "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" on firefox. I reinstalled and it worked for a few days no problems, but I just tried to open it and it started messing up again. I'm running edgy.
[04:39] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, hi again :) I took off the panel and checked for a free RAM slot on my laptop. But when I took off the panel, it only showed the RAM I got. You might know where my "free slot" is? :)
[04:39] <pirast> <Ice_Wewe>, feisty beta will probably get released on March 22nd
[04:39] <darko> how do i mount ntfs drives
[04:39] <stefania> pirast: i have just installed ubuntu server, using the ncurses installer. I have used the ncurses partitoning tool and found it very easy to use, specially for creating a raid1 arry.
[04:39] <jake_> <dxdemetriou> I installed vmware successfully, created a vm that was too big and then deleted it but my disk usage is still nearlt 100%
[04:40] <clop> hi, is there a "correct" way to install the proprietary nvidia driver on ubuntu?
[04:40] <stefania> pirast: now i need to create another raid1 set, without using the instalaltion disk
[04:40] <unfun> How do I know if I have breezer, dapper or edgy?
[04:40] <stefania> pirast: can you help me?
[04:40] <Chousuke> clop: using apt.
[04:40] <pirast> stefania, sorry.. i have to pass :-(
[04:40] <dxdemetriou> jake_, you must kill it 2 times
[04:40] <pirast> never used raid
[04:40] <clop> Chousuke, do you know what packages I should get?  I tried downloading "nvidia-glx" but got a message about not having the right kernel modules
[04:40] <dxdemetriou> jake_, I had similar problem
[04:41] <stefania> pirast: i know raid, but i only need to know the name of the partitioning program
[04:41] <Chousuke> clop: I think you need the linux-restricted-modules or something
[04:41] <stefania> that is in the ncurses installation
[04:41] <stefania> can you help me?
[04:41] <Chousuke> !info linux-restricted-modules
[04:41] <jake_> ??
[04:41] <ubotu> Package linux-restricted-modules does not exist in any distro I know
[04:41] <clop> ok, i'll try that out, thanks :)
[04:41] <Chousuke> hmm :/
[04:41] <unfun> How do I know if I have breezer or dapper?
[04:41] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:41] <Chousuke> I can't remember the name of the package  ;P
[04:41] <Finsta1> It's a bit off topic but resizing on Windows kills it and I have to restore using Ghost
[04:41] <dxdemetriou> jake_, kill it as many times there is, and try the sudo apt-get remove libdbus-1-2
[04:41] <pirast> <stefania>, afaik it is in the installer and you can't call it afterwards, but please be patient.. ill look if i found any clues.
[04:41] <clop> Chousuke, i think it's linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic for my kernel
[04:41] <dxdemetriou> jake_, after will be ok

[04:42] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: yeah, I'm not really gonna use Edgy or Feisty right now
[04:42] <clop> Chousuke, ok thanks, gotta restart x :)
[04:42] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: so does that mean that there are 2 slots that are each filled with some RAM?
[04:42] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, I could only find one slot .. dont know where the other one might be

[04:43] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: I'm checking...
[04:43] <dxdemetriou> I am confused somehow with edgy. I have read on forum that edgy is for persons that must know how to fix some things. It have to do with security, or only to fix something?
[04:44] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: well, since I can't see the laptop, I'll have to trust your judgement, however, reading a review of this notebook, the reviewer indicates that with 512MB of system ram, there should be 2x256
[04:44] <Ice_Wewe> dxdemetriou: yes, I'd consider Edgy far from stable
[04:45] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:45] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, hm, ok ...thanks :) Ill check with my local computer store

[04:45] <Ice_Wewe> pirast: it seems that Ubuntu management or devs are just trying to pump out as many versions of this as they can, and dont' really care about final quality or the fact that the stable release is full of bugs
[04:45] <pirast> aha!

[04:46] <Ice_Wewe> unfun: that won't necessaryly tell you
[04:46] <dxdemetriou> Ice_Wewe, ok with that. the next version will be upgraded from dapper or edgy?
[04:46] <slavik> Dapper: I have to enter my password 2 times when logging in and also, sudo asks for password two times, USB drive does not get automounted. I cannot see any windows shares on the network.
[04:46] <roxlu> sb who knows how to fix that?
[04:46] <stefania> roxlu: can you paste your openvpn.conf ?
[04:46] <roxlu> yep

[04:47] <pirast> and at the mdadm manpages

[04:48] <roxlu> stefania: and here the client .vopn: http://rafb.net/paste/results/K0uFGH96.html
[04:48] <Ice_Wewe> dxdemetriou: if you're running Dapper, then Edgy is newer. If you're running Edgy, then Feisty is newer. However, Feisty is still in early development.
[04:49] <Ice_Wewe> dxdemetriou: if you're running Breezy or Hooray, then Dapper is newer
[04:49] <Morrissey> yes Ice_Wewe unfortunally I have 2x256 ... the buying more RAM would be really expencieve :)
[04:49] <dxdemetriou> Ice_Wewe, I am on edgy. that I mean, when Feisty released can I upgrade it from dapper?
[04:49] <LjL> dxdemetriou: eh? from dapper? you just said you're on edgy
[04:50] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: yup, RAM isn't cheap
[04:50] <Finsta1> Yeah, but he may have another PC
[04:50] <Ice_Wewe> dxdemetriou: I'm gonna hand you over to LjL, I have to go enjoy the day...
[04:50] <Morrissey> Ice_Wewe, sometimes it is :) hehe ... strange thing that is! THanks btw, youv been helpfull
[04:50] <stefania> roxlu: i cannot find anything wrong... :(
[04:50] <glombool> Did anyone take over the Cinelerra package for Ubuntu?
[04:50] <Ice_Wewe> Morrissey: np, good luck
[04:50] <dxdemetriou> LjL, I have an image of Dapper if the things don't go well
[04:50] <roxlu> hmm strange
[04:51] <roxlu> can't I set an IP for the client in the client config?
[04:51] <dxdemetriou> Ice_Wewe, sorry for that :)
[04:51] <LjL> dxdemetriou, no, you won't likely be able to upgrade from dapper to feisty directly without going through edgy

[05:04] <LjL> slavik, no, i believe the automounting this is done in completely different ways in Gnome and KDE. (but then i don't even know how it's done on KDE :)
[05:04] <smoenux> 6.10 (Edgy)
[05:04] <tuvok> is it stabil?
[05:04] <james__> Yes
[05:04] <james__> I would say so

[05:09] <stiffme1983> James: this pkg is gone,so apt-get thinks that the other pkgs are useless then
[05:09] <LjL> glombool, that's strange, since you didn't have -security and -updates enabled before. are you sure you ran "sudo apt-get update" after changing the sources.list?
[05:09] <itrebal> is there a way to install Ubuntu Edgy Eft *without* going through all that graphical crap and like-CD?

[05:15] <stiffme1983> James: Does it mean that if i want to customize my desktop softwares, i can't install ubuntu-desktop instead but to install all the pkgs by hand?
[05:16] <glombool> pirast no

[05:16] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[05:16] <pirast> <glombool>, fresh edgy install? or upgraded from dapper?
[05:16] <glombool> pirast fresh install
[05:16] <master0onxbox> is ther nobody that know how you start a session an keep it running after logging off
[05:16] <James> Can't you just install ubuntu-Desktop then remove/add the pkgs you want?
[05:16] <stiffme1983> James: yes ,i can
[05:17] <stiffme1983> James: but it will remove ubuntu-desktop also
[05:17] <pirast> <glombool>, execute this: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx
[05:17] <James> I think you should just try apt-get autoremove it should sort things out, and you can always install it again
[05:17] <glombool> pirast it won't.  Says I already have the newest version
[05:17] <stiffme1983> James: and them it will asks me to autoremove all other pkgs, 'cause other pkgs including xserver are installed by installing o

[05:18] <Discerer> anyone know of a good FTP program with SSL or SSH capabilities?
[05:18] <James> proftpd
[05:18] <pirast> glombool, then try this: sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx
[05:18] <Comrade_S> Discerer: gftp
[05:19] <pirast> <James>, he's right. when ubuntu-desktop is not installed, apt-get autoremove nearly uninstalls your whole system
[05:19] <Discerer> ty James and Comrade_S
[05:19] <glombool> pirast It reinstalled.  Getting same error when I try to enable it though.
[05:19] <Discerer> proftpd wasn't evailable but
[05:19] <Discerer> available*
[05:20] <pirast> <glombool>, that's bad. do you know how you get back to your gui?
[05:20] <stiffme1983> James: then to install ubuntu-desktop pkg means that you can't remove all the default desktop pkgs
[05:20] <Discerer> oh I meant ftp server, not client.
[05:20] <glombool> glombool  I'm in the gui

[05:33] <deema> hey guys, so when I run glxgears, I get 350 FPS on my Nvidia Geforce 2, and a game I have runs pretty slow. I've installed the official Nvidia drivers from synaptic and changed xorg.conf to nvidia, but it's a bit slow. any way to fix this, speed it up?  I hear 350 FPS isn't that normal for glxgears
[05:33] <soundray> distrbnce: do you have the horizontal sync and vertical refresh ranges for your monitor? Then use "Advanced" for setting up the Monitor section as you go through 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'

[05:46] <clop> Zarephath, i mean the virtual terminals, not a x/gnome terminal

[05:47] <soundray> distrbnce: yes. After that, you should see more options in System-Preferences--Screen Res
[05:47] <haxality> ahhhh, thanks MarcN
[05:47] <Zarephath> clop: Ahh the tty's....
[05:47] <haxality> I couldn't find that ANYWHERE on the entire internet
[05:47] <icaro> anyone can tell me how to show my pic in Gaim 2.0 ?
=== Hamish is now known as Hamish`
[05:48] <geokok> soundray: U wish for more specific?How can I fix the form wizard in OO base?
[05:48] <Talijan> hey guys
[05:48] <ion> haxality:yeah but I don't wanna buy photoshop and I don't have it..that's the point...
[05:48] <soundray> geokok: I'm on live CD at present, so it may take a while. But if you tell me what it is, I'm happy to try and reproduce your prob.
[05:48] <haxality> ion: http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/
[05:48] <jrib> icaro: account > edit account
[05:48] <Talijan> i have a problem, i can't copy a file from the desktop to filesystem why ?
[05:48] <yango> hi, anyone familiar with beagle?
[05:48] <Talijan> it has that i don't have access......
[05:48] <ion> haxality:cool..many many thanks..
[05:48] <icaro> thnaks jrib
[05:49] <geokok> soundray: Of course mate. The problem is that the form wizard will not finish with FSF java and wont even start with SUN java
[05:49] <soundray> Talijan: you only have access to your home directory. That is also the only place where you should store user files.
[05:49] <haxality> so MarcN, I should comment out all the lines that don't have lo in them?
[05:49] <Talijan> soundray, but i also can't copy another file from filesystem to desktop ?
[05:49] <icaro> hehe it's almost invisibel :P
[05:50] <soundray> geokok: That I'll have to test when I'm on a full system again.
[05:50] <soundray> Talijan: what file is that?
[05:50] <geokok> soundray: the problem appears on live cd as well. I ve tried it
[05:50] <higi_> does anyone know why i see emacs really bad, i cannot read what i type, i just see squares!!
[05:50] <Talijan> soundray: i named it seminarski.doc and with the mv command moved it there
[05:50] <ThePianoGuy> hi
[05:51] <Talijan> but i would like to move it like in windows by just copy/paste-ing instead of using terminal.. ?
[05:51] <ThePianoGuy> how do I call arbitrary python script/function from C? Could someone point me to any python irc channels please?
[05:51] <higi_> does anyone know why i see emacs really bad, i cannot read what i type, i just see squares!!
[05:51] <soundray> Talijan: and what's the problem you have with that?
[05:51] <Talijan> can't just copy paste
[05:52] <soundray> Talijan: are you trying via the context menu?
[05:52] <Talijan> ok...
[05:52] <Talijan> solved that
[05:52] <Talijan> but how can i now copy the same file on my windows partition ?
[05:52] <icaro> ...and how can I show my image in the chat window once it has been chosen in gaim?
[05:53] <jrib> ThePianoGuy: #python
[05:53] <techNiKal> hi i want to ask is there any package to see the machines getting conected to the gateway machine and disconnecting from it ? and what bandwidth or traffic they are generating such as either they are downloading or producing other type of traffic ?
[05:54] <mribas> hola hay alguien que quiera hablar conmigo
[05:54] <elmargol> Hi how can I change my bootsplash/terminal resolution?
[05:54] <Talijan> is there a way to do that also via the cotext menu ?
[05:54] <Subhuman> elmargol, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[05:54] <soundray> Talijan: you cannot write to a Windows partition. Use a USB stick.
[05:54] <elmargol> Subhuman: isn't there a dpkg-reconfigure way?
[05:54] <Talijan> ok thx
[05:54] <distrbnce> thanks a lot soundray
[05:55] <soundray> distrbnce: it worked then?
[05:55] <Subhuman> elmargol, you jus have to add "vga=hexcode" ( where hexcode is a code you can get from a table) to a line
[05:55] <distrbnce> yeah, i only got one more option, but it's a good comprimise
[05:55] <Subhuman> elmargol, # defoptions= splash elevator=cfq vga=791
[05:55] <Subhuman>  that line
[05:55] <distrbnce> i'll have to find the info for this monitor so i can get more
[05:55] <elmargol> Subhuman: 1680x1050?
[05:55] <Subhuman> mine says 791, get the correct reso from here:
[05:55] <Subhuman> elmargol, you cant use that resolutuon
[05:55] <haxality> ok... this is weird
[05:56] <haxality> when I run nm-applet, all I get is settings for my ethernet card
[05:56] <soundray> geokok: it's taking ages to run in live...
[05:56] <haxality> which isn't plugged in..
[05:56] <Yasuo> hi, the write-speed of my new usbmp3-player is about 16KB/s, anyone has an idea?
[05:56] <Subhuman> your framebuffer has to be 4:3, so 1024x768 , 1280x1024, 1600x1200...
[05:56] <crptx> I'll soon find out
[05:56] <Subhuman> !vga
[05:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vga - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:56] <Subhuman> !usplash
[05:56] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[05:57] <jerp> There[ no EasyUbuntu or Automatix for Edgy yet?
[05:57] <Subhuman> elmargol, youll want the code vga=794
[05:57] <Subhuman> it wont fill that resolution, but its better than nothing
[05:57] <techNiKal> hi i want to ask is there any package to see the machines getting conected to the gateway machine and disconnecting from it ? and what bandwidth or traffic they are generating such as either they are downloading or producing other type of traffic ?
[05:57] <soundray> jerp: EasyUbuntu svn version sort-of worked for me in edgy
[05:57] <soundray> geokok: I see what you mean, it has crashed now.
[05:58] <Subhuman> like my laptop is 1280x800, so i have a 1024x768 framebuffer and its quite usuable.
[05:58] <jerp> soundray, thanks, I might give it a try just to see what it does
[05:58] <geokok> soundray: what do u think of it?
[05:58] <elmargol> hmm there is a 1400x1050 framebuffer resolution
[05:59] <ThePianoGuy> jrib: it sais You need to be identified to join that channel
[05:59] <ThePianoGuy> if I want to join #python
[05:59] <glombool> pirast  Things got a little messed up.  Guess my xorg.conf was out of date and  Xserv couldn't start.  So, now I'm back to where we were before.. What was that other command you had me type before modprobe nvidia?
[05:59] <jrib> !register | ThePianoGuy
[05:59] <ubotu> ThePianoGuy: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[05:59] <haxality> this is really frustrating.
[05:59] <geokok> soundray: In my case it crashes when I hit "finish" in the form wizard
[05:59] <soundray> geokok: .xsession-errors says something about "Invalid WM_TRANSIENT_FOR window"...
[05:59] <Subhuman> elmargol, use that vga number then - make sure you add it to the line "defoptions" and then run "sudo update-grub
[05:59] <haxality> no websites anywhere have any information for troubleshooting network manager.
[05:59] <Subhuman> then reboot.
[05:59] <pirast> <glombool>, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:59] <soundray> geokok: maybe it's not a Java problem?
[05:59] <elmargol> Subhuman: k thx i try it
[05:59] <pirast> <glombool>, just always press enter
[06:00] <jerp> thepianoguy, I think they want to have everyone register their nick
[06:00] <soundray> geokok: did it work for you in dapper? Dapper live?
[06:00] <glombool> pirast xserver is up and running again.
[06:00] <geokok> soundray: if u try with saun java the wizard wont even start though......Unfortunately I never tried it in dapper
[06:00] <pirast> glombool, yeah, but that command creates a clean xorg.conf :-)
[06:00] <ThePianoGuy> ok, tnx :)
[06:01] <pirast> glombool, have to restart here, brb
[06:02] <soundray> geokok: I never used base seriously. I tried OO as a frontend for mysql. Got it to work eventually, and it was okay... but I mostly run mysql cli now, or from R.
[06:03] <haffe> Hello. THis might seem like an old question. But I would like to know if there is a free driver that will let me use the fax in my conexant HCF modem.
[06:03] <soundray> geokok: have you searched launchpad for bugs against base?
[06:03] <geokok> soundray: Me neither but in my opinion the main office suite of a distro should not have such major flaws. Moreover I was told (but dont know for sure myself) that this is broken only in edgy and that OO works in other platforms
[06:03] <geokok> soundray: yes but did not find anything
[06:04] <geokok> soundray: assuming that I searched correctly that is....
[06:04] <soundray> geokok: would you mind reporting it, then? Ubuntu needs your help to become a better distribution...
[06:05] <soundray> geokok: if you haven't, your report will be filed with any existing reports by the package maintainer.
[06:05] <daidungsi> hi
[06:05] <daidungsi> i'm newbie of ubuntu
[06:05] <daidungsi> how can i log on root
[06:05] <daidungsi> without pass
[06:05] <Yasuo> daidungsi, sudo passwd
[06:05] <geokok> soundray: I would be more than happy too. Wold u care to back it up ?
[06:05] <Yasuo> or sudo sh
[06:05] <soundray> !sudo | daidungsi
[06:05] <ubotu> daidungsi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:05] <daidungsi> Yasuo : thanks
[06:06] <soundray> Yasuo: don't give this advice please.
[06:06] <foormea> hi
[06:06] <Yasuo> daidungsi, and after setting rot-password: "su -" or just log on as root
[06:06] <soundray> daidungsi: please don't use sudo passwd or sudo sh
[06:06] <UmbraAdmin> hi a
[06:06] <UmbraAdmin> all
[06:06] <bountu> Is there a central app/tool I can use to control what is loaded at startup, modules, services, daemons, etc.?  I'd like to clean out what I don't need from the boot.
[06:06] <eneried> bueno, es hora de irme
[06:07] <Yasuo> daidungsi, the common way is ubuntu to do something with superuser right is to do "sudo command"
[06:07] <soundray> daidungsi: to get a root shell, use sudo -i
[06:07] <eneried> chao chicos
[06:07] <UmbraAdmin> is the vmlinuz-2.6.12-9-386 kernel a generic one in Ubuntu ?
[06:07] <livingtarget> how can I see all the /dev/hdX drives that are detected?
[06:07] <daidungsi> thanks everyone
[06:07] <eneried> hehe, sorry, i have to say bye, boys, is time to go
[06:07] <fatbrain> Where can I change the modprobe arguments for a loaded erm, device?
[06:07] <daidungsi> i try

[06:09] <alecjw> can someone recommend me a REALLY lightweight word processor wghic will work well on my fluxbox machine?
[06:09] <geokok> soundray:maybe that is why it sucks
[06:09] <bountu> ...or just any way of ridding myself of the services and modules I know I don't need, like what config files to edit or so.
[06:09] <soundray> geokok: you can't file an edgy bug against OO?
[06:09] <kdefrysk> abiword
[06:09] <adilson> vi :)

[06:10] <simen> hi folks
[06:10] <alecjw> kdefrysk: i mean a proper word processor with formattign and stuff
[06:10] <geokok> soundray: should i file it under edgy instead of OO?
[06:10] <kdefrysk> alecjw, abiword
[06:10] <simen> I need help recording in ubuntu, cant seem to get any sound
[06:10] <alecjw> ok, thanks kdefrysk
[06:10] <prestosd> kdefrysk, still can't get resolution higher then 1024x768. ;(
[06:10] <simen> recording sound :)
[06:10] <vader> simen, do you have gaim running?
[06:10] <soundray> livingtarget: sudo fdisk -l
[06:11] <simen> no
[06:11] <kdefrysk> prestosd, sorry :(
[06:11] <prestosd> urg
[06:11] <bountu> vader: ctrl+alt+backspace kills a normal X session, sending you back to textmode or gdm/kdm.
[06:11] <vader> k, that sometimes hurts the sound lol
[06:11] <prestosd> kdefrysk, I've reinstalled, and done just about everything else to my drivers
[06:11] <simen> oki
[06:11] <kdefrysk> did you rerun sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:11] <vader> bountu, it reboots the pc
[06:11] <prestosd> kdefrysk, still no go
[06:11] <prestosd> no
[06:11] <kdefrysk> and set the resolutions properly ?
[06:11] <prestosd> i dont think................
[06:12] <prestosd> lemme try
[06:12] <kdefrysk> prestosd, yust run the defaults again exept for the resolutions
[06:12] <bountu> vader: ..hrm.  'killall gdm' or 'kdm' ?
[06:12] <prestosd> k
[06:12] <vader> k
[06:12] <kdefrysk> sudo killall gdm
[06:13] <UmbraAdmin> How can i fix a Kernal panic -not syncing:VFS:Unable to mount root fs.... when i move the hd to another comp ?
[06:14] <shape_> guys i'm looking for skype
[06:14] <geokok> soundray: if u can figure out how to file a report for base would u do it? And of course I would post on it as well.
[06:14] <vader> kdefrysk, thnx
[06:14] <shape_> does exist a .deb file
[06:14] <[erisco] > I am trying to run "make" but it comes back saying "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."
[06:14] <shape_> ?
[06:14] <[erisco] > what is happening?
[06:14] <kdefrysk> vader, I hope it fits your needs ;)
[06:14] <PacketScan> shape, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
[06:14] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , exactly what is says
[06:15] <jason0_> Trying to get ndiswrapper working w/ WEP. The driver seemed to work okay before, but now when I go to install it says: tnet1130 invalid driver! I've tried uninstalling/recompiling ndiswrapper but still having the same issue. Ideas?
[06:15] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, how should I run the make command then?
[06:15] <kdefrysk> no run ./configure
[06:15] <soundray> geokok: I will try, but right now I'm fixing some hard disk trouble. Won't be till after the weekend.
[06:15] <kdefrysk> then rum make
[06:15] <kdefrysk> run*
=== Versed is now known as Versed`
[06:15] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I did run ./configure
[06:16] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , try gmake
[06:16] <prestosd> kdefrysk, okay! I ran all the defaults EXCEPT the resolutions! Now should i reboot or do something else first?
[06:16] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, command not found
[06:16] <geokok> soundray: No problem. Just make a relevant post in the forums saying where the report is so that me and others can confirm the bug
[06:16] <kdefrysk> prestosd, just restart x and best wishes ;)
[06:16] <prestosd> Thanks! :D
[06:16] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , did you install build-essential ?
[06:16] <prestosd> *gulp* here goes........................................................
[06:16] <Xal2> Hi
[06:16] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, yes I did
[06:17] <soundray> kdefrysk: bet he's in the wrong dir
[06:17] <kdefrysk> what package is it ?
[06:17] <Xal2> Linux isn't seeing my partitions. They showed up correclty in my previous Ubuntu installation, but in setup, it shows a hard drive with no partitions.
[06:17] <kdefrysk> soundray, who knows :D
[06:17] <[erisco] > Gaim, the beta release
[06:17] <Xal2> I tried to enter qtparted, but I get the following error:
[06:17] <Xal2> critical error during ped_disk_new
[06:17] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , good luck with that one
[06:17] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, is it not known to work well
[06:17] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , in dapper ?
[06:18] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, how do you mean?
[06:18] <Xal2> Can anyone here help me out?
[06:18] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , if you are in edgy eft you have almost the latest gaim
[06:18] <darko> can u play games on ubuntu
[06:18] <soundray> Xal2: I'm not familiar with that error, but I hope you have a backup...
[06:18] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, there is a bug going around with gaim or msn that is causing gaim to crash, which is why I am going to try the beta release
[06:19] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , does your gaim crash ?
[06:19] <Xal2> soundray: I don't care about the files... It's just that I don't want to start this crap over.
[06:19] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, yes
[06:19] <foormea> hey, do you know how to make Eterm look better under gnome? cause it gets with 2 sets of edges, gnome's and itself's
[06:19] <kdefrysk> wow
[06:19] <Xal2> Any idea why it would do this?
[06:19] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , mine never crashes
[06:19] <Xal2> The partition table should be fine.
[06:19] <soundray> Xal2: no, but I would just try creating a new partition table. I.e. treat the disk as if it was brand new.
[06:19] <shape_> thank you
[06:20] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , what version of ubuntu are you running ?
[06:20] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, mine has over and over randomly... http://gaim.sourceforge.net/index.php it was a reported problem in the news
[06:20] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, 6.06
[06:20] <soundray> Xal2: you haven't modified any settings in the BIOS setup relating to LBA or similar?
[06:20] <Xal2> Hmm, I wish that wasn't the only option, lol
[06:20] <Xal2> No
[06:20] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , I rarely say this but in your case I would grab the latest .package of gaim and install that
[06:20] <alecjw> does anyone know of any low - rescource file managers for fluxbox?
[06:20] <darko> can u play games suck as fifa 2006, rome total war, and games as such on ubuntu
[06:21] <bountu> alecjw: midnight commander in rxvt ;?)
[06:21] <soundray> Xal2: check the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'. Any partitions seen by that tool?
[06:21] <prestosd> darko usually
[06:21] <prestosd> darko: depends
[06:21] <Doow> dark: some of them probably work under wine
[06:21] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, is ".package" referred to as an extension?
[06:21] <alecjw> bountu: is midnight commanger graphical?
[06:21] <Xal2> Yes
[06:21] <Xal2> Fdisk sees all my partitions.
[06:21] <notwist> How come my xbox can see my samba-shares fine, but Vista and XP says it needs user and password? :S
[06:21] <prestosd> darko: check out www.frankscorner.org
[06:21] <bountu> alecjw: Yes and no.  It's textmode-graphics
[06:21] <prestosd> it has great info on windows apps in linux
[06:21] <alecjw> bountu: like aptitude?
[06:22] <bountu> alecjw: gnome-commander exists as a graphical version, not sure how dependent it is on the presence of gnome though
[06:22] <alecjw> o, thanks bountu
[06:22] <alecjw> *ok
[06:22] <soundray> Xal2: some good news at least...
[06:22] <prestosd> kdefrysk, no go ;(
[06:22] <bountu> alecjw: yeah, kind of like aptitude
[06:22] <Xal2> Do I just need to repair it somehow?
[06:22] <soundray> Xal2: is downloading and installing from the Alternate CD an option for you?
[06:22] <jamesrose> How do i upgrade beryl?
=== jme is now known as Twinxor
[06:23] <Xal2> I tried taht.
[06:23] <kdefrysk> prestosd, my bad :(
[06:23] <Xal2> that*
=== jamesrose is now known as james
[06:23] <Xal2> It shows the same thing.
[06:23] <prestosd> kdefrysk, no, its not your fault
=== james is now known as James
[06:23] <soundray> Xal2: that's seriously weird.
[06:23] <prestosd> gtg
[06:23] <kdefrysk> prestosd, get a nice nvidia vid card
[06:23] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I was trying the tar one, maybe the rpm will work
[06:23] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , nope
[06:23] <kdefrysk> they all wont
[06:24] <soundray> Xal2: could you get another HD and use it as the system disk? You would then have a larger choice of tools to repair the problematic disk with.
[06:24] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , the .package is a static version , witch is more likely to work on dapper
[06:24] <Xal2> No
[06:24] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, really? Where can I find a .package file?
[06:24] <Xal2> Unfortunately not
[06:25] <jason0_> How do I completely uninstall ndiswrapper?
[06:25] <soundray> Xal2: you currently have a working older ubuntu on that disk?
[06:25] <Er-Gladiatore> hello
[06:25] <Xal2> No, I just formatted it, actually. I wanted to do a full reinstall because I wanted the new version.
[06:25] <Xal2> I had 6.06 upgraded to 6.10, and it didn't work too well.
[06:26] <soundray> Xal2: you formatted it how?
[06:26] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , give me a sec so i can have a look
[06:26] <Xal2> I used Acronis Disk Manager, but that wasn't the problem. I tried this before I formatted, too, but the disk still showed up like this.
[06:26] <UmbraAdmin> How can i fix a Kernal Panic - not syncing:VFS:Unable to mount root fs.  when i move the disc to another comp ?
[06:27] <dope12345> it would seem as though wireless in ubuntu is pretty much impossible
[06:27] <UmbraAdmin> kernel
[06:27] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , its not available unfortunately
[06:27] <Xal2> dope12345: look up directions for ndiswrapper and wpa_supplicant. I have found those two applications to be the easiest solution for wireless networking.
[06:28] <axisys> !asterisk
[06:28] <ubotu> asterisk: Open Source Private Branch Exchange (PBX). In component universe, is optional. Version 1:1.2.12.1.dfsg-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 137 kB, installed size 400 kB
[06:28] <soundray> Xal2: you could try rewriting the same partition table that fdisk -l sees, by running fdisk /dev/hdX and typing 'w'.
[06:28] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, ah well thanks for your help anyways. Hopefully whatever bug is flying around is with MSN and not gaim, and will just magically "go away" sometime soon ;)
[06:28] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , maybe upgrade to edgy might help you out :)
[06:28] <dope12345> i've got ndiswrapper but for some reason i can't connect to any networks
[06:28] <dope12345> i can see them
[06:28] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, what is edgy?
[06:28] <[erisco] > !edgy
[06:28] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[06:28] <dope12345> i have the broadcom 4306 card
[06:29] <Xal2> I'll have to finish this later, but that command does not work. It says it cannot open the disk.
[06:29] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: you need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst in the system partition, updating the boot entry to the new root device name
[06:29] <Doow> UmbraAdmin: it could be that your disk is identified as some other device on the new comp, boot up with other OS on the new comp and check if it identifies as the same disk, otherwise you'll have to edit your fstab
[06:29] <kdefrysk> thats about it yes ;)
[06:29] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, WHAT?!? they have yet another one?
[06:29] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , where did you come from ?
[06:29] <soundray> Xal2: sudo fdisk /dev/hdX then
[06:29] <abo> in gaim, in msn chat, how can I invite someone to a conversation?
[06:29] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, under a box
[06:29] <Doow> UmbraAdmin: go with soundrays advice first, he probably know this better =)
[06:29] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I thought 6.06 was going to be the last
[06:29] <UmbraAdmin> hmm soundray it should be the same since its still on Master 0
[06:30] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, can I upgrade my install without reformatting? :o
[06:30] <soundray> Doow: thanks...
[06:30] <Doow> soundray: np =)
[06:30] <dope12345> what driver do you guys use for the 4306 broadcom cards?
[06:30] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: is it a SATA disk?
[06:30] <UmbraAdmin> nope
[06:30] <notwist> How come my xbox can see my samba-shares fine, but Vista and XP says it needs user and password? :S
[06:30] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , you can , make sure to back up remove all alein material and after dist-upgrade make sure to sudo apt-get install (k)ubuntu-desktop
[06:30] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, aww it is only supported for 18 months though... maybe I shouldn't bother to upgrade
[06:30] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: is it the only disk in the system?
[06:31] <UmbraAdmin> yes soundray
[06:31] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, probably not going to be of much benefit for me to upgrade anyways
[06:31] <UmbraAdmin> it also say unkown block (o,o)
[06:31] <Sirron> How would I go about assosciating .exe files with wine please? o.O
[06:31] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , as A desktop user wanting the latest and the greatest you'd better upgrade every 6 months
[06:31] <UmbraAdmin> 0,0
[06:31] <LinuxHelp> Sirron, binfmt something..
[06:32] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: maybe the access mode is different. Any options in the BIOS letting you set LBA or similar?
[06:32] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , but thats all up to you of course :)
[06:32] <specialbuddy> how do I mount a portable ext2 harddrive?
[06:32] <LinuxHelp> apt-get install binfmt-support
[06:32] <soundray> specialbuddy: USB?
[06:32] <specialbuddy> yeah
[06:32] <UmbraAdmin> hmm ill check that soundray
[06:32] <kdefrysk> automauths iiRc
[06:32] <soundray> specialbuddy: should show up as you plug it in.
[06:32] <kdefrysk> automaunts
[06:32] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, *sigh* well not for a while at least. Upgrading from 6.06 will be nothing but troubles so I will probably back up and reformat
[06:33] <Sirron> ok, I'll try it, cheers LinuxHelp
[06:33] <specialbuddy> well it did but I changed fstab so that it will mount to a location I want it in
[06:33] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, but I mean even coming from 5.10 to 6.06, what is the difference? *shrug*
[06:33] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , good choice , and make a seperate /home so there is less hassle
[06:33] <specialbuddy> /dev/sda5 /media/usbbackup auto defaults,rw,nosuid,quiet,shortname=mixed,users,iocharset=utf8 0 0
[06:33] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, how do you mean separate /home?
[06:33] <futureng> How can i find turkish cahnnel?
[06:34] <LinuxHelp> Sirron, I also think that the "wine" package needs to "register" the .exe file format with binfmt-support, not really sure though
[06:34] <beasty> wootzoot
[06:34] <sonium_> does evolution mail have a GPG support?
[06:34] <sonium_> like enigmail
[06:34] <soundray> specialbuddy: 'sudo mount -a' then, and remove 'auto,defaults' from the fstab entry
[06:34] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , if you make a seperate /home your settings and files will stay inthere for the /home is not needed to reformat for a new install
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> soundray my grub looks like this ->
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> Root	(hd0,0)
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> Kernel	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-9-386
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> Root=/dev/hda1 ro quit splash
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.12.9-386	
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> if that helps
[06:34] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: don't paste here
[06:34] <kdefrysk> you your /home/username will remain preserved
[06:34] <Sirron> Linuxhelp, ok, I just came from their channel and they sent me here :P it's like commerical tech support
[06:34] <UmbraAdmin> sorry
[06:34] <abo> in gaim, in msn chat, how can I invite someone to a conversation?
[06:34] <LinuxHelp> :P
[06:35] <specialbuddy> this is the error I get - wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda5
[06:35] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, so I just backup the whole /home directory :P Right? Cool. Actually I wouldn't mind dumping a lot of it heh, getting a little messy. Probably just keep my desktop items and a couple folders from home
[06:35] <Joe_SWAU> Hi, I am having troubles. I need to install something from source. I don't have the build-essential package installed. I can't connect to the internet.
[06:35] <Sirron> meh, I'll go to the forum then, if it can be done. thanks
[06:35] <kdefrysk> !backup
[06:35] <ubotu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi
[06:35] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , read what ubotu said
[06:36] <soundray> UmbraAdmin: "Root=..." should be in the same line as kernel and should be lowercase
[06:36] <dope12345> anyone here using wireless with ubuntu and using the broadcom 4306
[06:36] <acidspoon> hi @ll
[06:36] <UmbraAdmin> my misstake it is soundray
[06:36] <acidspoon> does anybody know how to burn mdf-images in ubuntu?
[06:37] <bountu> 'lsmod' shows a heap of stuff I don't need - what do I edit or run to trim out the modules I don't need so they won't load on boot any more?
[06:37] <slavik> dope12345: 4318 here, I feel your pain
[06:37] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: there's a good chance build-essential is on the Ubuntu install CD; do you have one?
[06:37] <dope12345> how do i get this thing to work 123$%#$^%#$
[06:37] <slavik> bountu: how do you know you don't need those modules?
[06:37] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Yes, I do. (Well, it is the LiveCD version.)
[06:37] <slavik> roryy: more than a good chance, it IS there :P
[06:37] <slavik> well, the dapper one anyway
[06:37] <futureng> what is the "synaptic" how is it use?
[06:37] <bountu> slavik: er... bluetooth modules, for instance, I know I don't need those since there's no single bluetooth device on the box
[06:37] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: have you installed Ubuntu, or are you running from the Live CD ?
[06:38] <slavik> bountu: good point
[06:38] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: How do I get it from there? I have installed Ubuntu.
[06:38] <alecjw> dope12345: i am. i'll give u a link to a tutorial
[06:38] <slavik>  /etc/default ... or some such
[06:38] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, how screwy, my browser is trying to display the iso rather than download it. Wtf :P
[06:38] <abo> futureng, synaptic is a gui frontend for apt-get.. very handy to install programs
[06:38] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: what happens if you install 'build-essential' using Synaptic? Does it ask you to insert the CD?
[06:38] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I can try.
=== robert_ is now known as robert_|food
[06:38] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: what version of Ubuntu are you running?

[06:48] <finsta> Sounds like there's an issue with power scaling
[06:49] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: OK, I will try to help you install build-essential via the command-line.  Synaptic should work, but we may get better error messages the other way
[06:49] <finsta> Anybody have solutions for me?
[06:49] <hosky> switch beteween 0%->100%->0%->100%->0%->100%->0%->100%-> etc....

[06:50] <axisys> kdefrysk: have u tried 6.10?

[06:50] <Doow> Is there any reason for Nautilus to use 44% of my cpu? I don't even have a window with it open
[06:50] <axisys> kdefrysk: oops
[06:50] <lect0r> So are we allowed to talk about 6.10 in here? I just saw the release pages. Am kinda excited- especially the new gnome features- but can't help wondering- how's performance on 6.10?
[06:50] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, well duh lol :P
[06:50] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Ok, I am there. What do I need to do now?

[06:50] <finsta> hosky, check top to see if you have something that eats up 100%
[06:50] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I can just put it onto a windows computer and transfer it back, no?
[06:50] <lect0r> i noticed that 6.06 was considerably slower (interface and all) than breezy.
[06:50] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: OK, first please run 'ls /media/cdrom' -- you should see a list of files and directories, including 'isolinux' and 'pool', amongst others
[06:50] <axisys> kdefrysk: tab completion .. sorry.. meant to ask kinuxer
[06:50] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , of course

[06:51] <kinuxer> no yet
[06:51] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: hmm
[06:51] <hosky> but in top, in "cpu" put 50 o more
[06:51] <kdefrysk> axisys, darn tab completion ;p
[06:51] <hosky> wait, see you a screen
[06:51] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: but you do see a CD icon on your desktop?
[06:51] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: It shows up in cdrom1.
[06:51] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ah-ha
[06:51] <finsta> What laptop are you using, is it a Centrino/Pentium M?
[06:51] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I have 2 cd drives.
[06:51] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: you have two CD drives?
[06:51] <rag> i'm in laptop alternate cd which not detect any network card on installation start of alternate cd
[06:51] <warkruid> kinuxer: tried to run program alsamixer yet?
[06:52] <axisys> kdefrysk: i still like irssi
[06:52] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: try putting the CD in the other drive and running synaptic again
[06:52] <axisys> kdefrysk: nah.. i like cli
[06:52] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I have a cd in both drives.
[06:52] <kdefrysk> used since day one
[06:52] <hosky> finsta see -> http://img372.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sreencl5.png
[06:52] <rag> which module do i load?
[06:52] <LinuxHelp> How does one count the number of lines in a file again?
[06:52] <warkruid> LinuxHelp: wc -l
[06:52] <kdefrysk> axisys, I like the cli yes but not for chatting
[06:52] <axisys> LinuxHelp: wc -l
[06:52] <hosky> its only when i plug the ac adapter
[06:52] <rag> which module do i load basic network? ethernet
[06:52] <LinuxHelp> thx
[06:52] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: I think (though I'm not sure) that Synaptic (and apt, etc) want this CD in cdrom0
[06:52] <axisys> kdefrysk: heh
[06:53] <lect0r> Hi, i've also got another problem with my DVD-ROM on ubuntu. It works fine on windows- problem is, when i try to use it, it just keeps giving off the "bread check failed"
[06:53] <lect0r> Have to do a hdparm -w /dev/hdc everytime.
[06:53] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: it may be possible to convince them otherwise, but it will be simplest just to swap the CDs
[06:53] <mixandgo> any idea why there are a few filtered ports in ubuntu edgy default install ?
[06:53] <kinuxer> has tried,but it sasy no device it could recognize
[06:53] <finsta> hosky, I suggest you check on the forums
[06:53] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, "tar -cvpzf ../ericbackup.tgz" "tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive" what is wrong?
[06:53] <finsta> I have no idea
[06:53] <lect0r> in order to get it to work. any ideas what may be causing the problem.
[06:53] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: They are both install cds.
[06:53] <finsta> I think it has to do with buggy power scaling
[06:53] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I ran that on my desktop
[06:53] <Sir_Brizz> !gamepad
[06:53] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Same disc in each drive.
[06:53] <warkruid> kinuxer: oops..
[06:53] <hosky> finsta i don't find any post in laptop section
[06:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gamepad - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:53] <Sir_Brizz> does anyone know about configuring a gamepad on Ubuntu?
[06:53] <hosky> and i don't find any bug en lauchpad bugtrack
[06:53] <warkruid> kinuxer: laptop or pc?
[06:54] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , tar blabla <naam.tar>
[06:54] <kdefrysk> bijvoorbeeld
[06:54] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ok, does 'ls /media/cdrom0' show the same contents as 'ls /media/cdrom1' ?
[06:54] <finsta> I suggest you post your issue in the laptop area, I'm thinking it is an issue with power scaling since it is only when you plug in the AC
[06:54] <shape> guys in wich rep frostwire is?
[06:54] <kinuxer> what is laptop?
[06:54] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , you have to give the package a name
[06:54] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: It shows nothing.
[06:54] <warkruid> kinuxer: is your computer a laptop or a normal pc
[06:55] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, is that not what I did with "../ericbackup.tgz"?
[06:55] <kinuxer> a normal pc
[06:55] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: OK. please run 'mount /media/cdrom0' and then try 'ls /media/cdrom0' again
[06:55] <kinuxer> with asus k8n4-e
[06:55] <warkruid> kinuxer: what kind of soundcard do you have?
[06:55] <mixandgo> any idea why there are a few filtered ports in ubuntu edgy default install ?
[06:56] <variant> mixandgo: there are not
[06:56] <mixandgo> variant, yes there are
[06:56] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: It says special device /dev/hdd does not exist.
[06:56] <variant> mixandgo: no, there arn't
[06:56] <warkruid> mixandgo which ones?
[06:56] <mbb> !metacity
[06:56] <ubotu> metacity: A lightweight GTK2 based Window Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 1:2.16.3-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 385 kB, installed size 764 kB
[06:56] <mixandgo> variant, let me do a scan...
[06:56] <variant> mixandgo: gimmie the ip and i will to
[06:56] <redeeman> i don't think ubuntu filters anything by default
[06:57] <mixandgo> variant, 86.104.206.227
[06:57] <kinuxer> soundcard integration in asus k8n4-e
[06:57] <variant> mixandgo: edgy doesn't even come with a firewall
[06:57] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: odd.  Have you changed your hardware at all since installing?
[06:57] <mixandgo> 135-139 445 1433 5900
[06:57] <Doow> variant: ipchains seems to be there
[06:57] <warkruid> kinuxer: if you run the command "lspci" does the name of the soundcard get mentioned?
[06:57] <mbb> I have a few issues with metacity on a PC limited to 800x600 - can anyone point me to a resource (irc, forum, etc) for more help?
[06:58] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Yes.
[06:58] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , ricghtclick the folder in nautilus and choose compress it or something ;p
[06:58] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I installed a different sound card.
[06:58] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: hm. wouldn't have thought that would affect the cdrom drives
[06:58] <Doow> variant: iptables I mean of course
[06:58] <kinuxer> no,just like"Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device"
[06:59] <kdefrysk> [erisco] , als make sure to compress it to a place where you have rights
[06:59] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: it may be easiest just to get apt to look at the other cd-rom drive
[06:59] <variant> Doow: it should not be activated
[06:59] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I also switched where the cdroms were pluged in for the IDE cables, and Which was master etc...
[06:59] <variant> !iptables
[06:59] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[06:59] <kdefrysk> I have to go
[06:59] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ah-ha
[06:59] <warkruid> kinuxer: double oops.. the soundcard isn't recognized.
[06:59] <kdefrysk> bye all
[06:59] <cryptonic> iv made the kde gui the default how do i revert to gnome?
[06:59] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: It shows up fine on the bios.
[06:59] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, well the gui seems to be having a good go at it
[06:59] <kdefrysk> cool :0
[06:59] <kinuxer> now i am running 5.10,it is ok for sound,but when in 6.06,it can't run
[06:59] <clop> hi, i use gdm as my login; is there a way to get a shell script i wrote to start executing each time i log in?
[07:00] <Joe_SWAU> I made the faster cd-drive primary master 2nd cd drive primary slave, and hard drive secondary master.
[07:00] <warkruid> kinuxer: it seems as if the module for your soundcard is missing in 6.06.. strange.
[07:00] <variant> mixandgo: all that shows is that there is a firewall
[07:00] <shape> which are the dependencies for frostwire....i suppose something about java but i don't know exactly
[07:00] <kinuxer> i also meet this problem when i install fedora,and suse10.2
[07:00] <cryptonic> iv made the kde gui the default how do i revert to gnome?
[07:01] <kinuxer> yes!i think it is
[07:01] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: the machine in question is not connected to the internet, correct?
[07:01] <kinuxer> i am so trouble with it
[07:01] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: I can't connect it to the internet. Otherwise all my problems would be solved. *GRIN*
[07:01] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, awesome my desktop was backed up :)
[07:02] <mixandgo> variant, I can't connect to remote-desktop ! in dapper I could
[07:02] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: if you run 'cat /etc/fstab' you should see one line with something like '/dev/hd?    /media/cdrom0 ...', and another with '/dev/hd?    /media/cdrom1 ...'
[07:02] <warkruid> kinuxer: i can imagine.
[07:02] <[erisco] > kdefrysk, I never really care about installing apps again. That usually means I forget the ones I have installed and never used, which is a good thing
[07:02] <johns^> cryptonic: update-alternatives x-session-manager
[07:02] <warkruid> kinuxer: is your computer new or old?
[07:02] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: if we tweak those lines, by replacing the '?' with the right thing, we can get all this working again
[07:03] <johns^> sorry: sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
[07:03] <cryptonic> johns^ : update-alternatives: unknown argument `x-session-manager'
[07:03] <adilson> www.gamespot.com
[07:03] <kinuxer> i have  bought it only one more years. how could i do,simplely?could you give me a sugestion?
[07:03] <adilson> site muito 10 sobre games mas tem videos
[07:03] <adilson> e nao consigo ver
[07:03] <adilson> o que pode ser?
[07:03] <kinuxer> so i think it is still new
[07:03] <warkruid> kinuxer: moment..
[07:04] <shape> something about frostwire?
[07:04] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Ok, It says. "/dev/hdd  /media/cdrom0" and "/dev/hda     /media/cdrom1"
[07:04] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ok. hda is primary master, hdb is primary slave, hdc is secondary master and hdd is secondary slave
[07:05] <adieu> :)
[07:05] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: i'd guess you want hda for cdrom0 and hdb for cdrom1, but the other way around works too
[07:05] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: unmount cdrom1 first ('sudo umount /media/cdrom1' should do it)
[07:05] <netG> hi
[07:05] <warkruid> kinuxer: it is that "unknown device" in the lspci output that stumps me. I am afraid I can't help you further. :-(
[07:05] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Ok, how do I edit it? gedit /etc/fstab ?
=== rsa| is now known as chand[aw] 
[07:06] <netG> Is there any way to downgrade from feisty to edgy???
[07:06] <jerp> I had my cd audio playing before I loaded the libesd-alsa0 file with ap-get from the ubuntuedgyguide.org.  if I take it back out am I gonna lose all the programs in the window "Mark additional required changes?""
[07:06] <abo> when one just installs mysql, what would the default password be?
[07:06] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: yeah, but use 'gksudo gedit /etc/fstab'
[07:06] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: can you help me with my sound?
[07:06] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: or 'sudoedit /etc/fstab' to work in the terminal
[07:06] <kinuxer> oh,it doesn't matter,thank you all the same
[07:06] <shape> guys wherei can find something frostwire's dependencies?
[07:07] <dromer> ok, can anybody tell me where, in Openoffie Writer, I can find the export te PDF image settings ?
[07:07] <kinuxer> i think i have to compile the kernel ,do you think so?
[07:07] <VigoFuse> Greetings, is the Gnome GParted tool included in the 6.10 Edgy Eft ? or should I download and run it before the install?
[07:07] <warkruid> Anyone.. Does 6.06 still support OSS sound modules?
[07:07] <Frogg> This may sound like a silly question but how do i get my extended desktop enabled
[07:08] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: unmount was not found as a command.
=== bountu is now known as Crayden
[07:08] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: umount - u, not un
[07:08] <dromer> hey Crayden: same as from deoxy.org ? :)
[07:09] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: should've been unmount, but it's about 30 years too late to change it
[07:09] <Joe_SWAU> rory: Hehe, ok.
[07:10] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ok, now 'mount /media/cdrom0' and 'mount /media/cdrom1' -- nothing should be printed, and you should see two CD icons on your desktop
[07:10] <Crayden> dromer: meeebbe.
[07:10] <dromer> hehe, yes you are ;)
[07:10] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: How do I save the changes?
[07:10] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: you did save /etc/fstab ?
[07:10] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Not yet. How do I save it?
[07:10] <psycode> I have a system running ubuntu, but i'm not sure which ubuntu version is there. how can i check?
[07:10] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: are you using gedit?
[07:11] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: No, I am using sudoedit like you said.
[07:11] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: ah. Do you see '^G Get Help ^O WriteOut ' at the bottom of the screen ?
[07:11] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Yes.
[07:12] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: OK, type Ctrl-O and follow the prompts
[07:12] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: accept the default filename
[07:12] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: then Ctrl-X to exit
[07:12] <psycode> anyone?
[07:12] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: and finally 'cat /etc/fstab' to verify the changes
[07:12] <dromer> ok, can anybody tell me where, in Openoffice Writer, I can find the export te PDF image settings? I need to turn on: lossless image
[07:12] <poulap> anyone heard if someone got lucky to play sound on their toshiba laptop with ubuntu?
[07:13] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: you hopefully did not change any other lines
[07:13] <psycode> isn't there a way to find out which ubuntu is running? (5.04/6.06 etc.)
[07:13] <warkruid> poulap: yes me.. toshiba tecra
[07:13] <roryy> psycode: run lsb_release -a
[07:13] <warkruid> poulap: old model though
[07:14] <psycode> roryy, great thanks
[07:14] <Frem> poulap: I've got sound on my Toshiba Satellite (M55-S139)
[07:14] <poulap> me it is a toshiba satleite p100
[07:14] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: Ok, that worked good. Thanks. :-)
[07:14] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: hopefully synaptic Just Works now; let us know if it doesn't
[07:14] <Joe_SWAU> roryy: build-essential is installing now.
[07:14] <roryy> Joe_SWAU: good stuff
[07:14] <poulap> the icon is there and all..... but no sound ever came out of it :(
[07:14] <warkruid> poulap: had to run the program alsamixer first to get decent sound
[07:15] <poulap> i dont even get a beep
[07:15] <poulap> i will try alsamixer
[07:15] <poulap> brb
[07:15] <poulap> thanks
[07:16] <elite_hacker> The ubuntu download page says that I need 192 megs of ram to install the desktop cd.  I only have 128 megs of ram.  how should I install it?
[07:17] <roryy> elite_hacker: you can use the alternate install cd; I'm not sure what the minimum RAM is, but I *think* 128M is enough
[07:17] <alecjw> elite_hacker: use the alternate cd
[07:17] <shwag> Im trying to format a usb drive and it seems to stall at  Writing inode table.
[07:17] <Guest12925> yuhh
[07:18] <psycode> my apt fails connecting to security.ubuntu.com... (and so the download doesn't start) - any ideas why? (from my windows machine on the same LAN i can access security.ubuntu.com)
[07:18] <alecjw> elite_hacker: where do you live and what processor arch do you have? i'll send you a link to the right thin
[07:18] <alecjw> g
[07:18] <Discerer> network probs prolly
[07:18] <VigoFuse> Is the GPart included in the 6.10 Edgy setup or should I download a live CD and run it before installing on an XP box?
[07:18] <Discerer> check ifconfig or iwconfig if you have a wlan
[07:18] <ragnar_123> hey guys!
[07:19] <psycode> Discerer, it has an internal address if that's what you mean by checking ifconfig
[07:19] <adieu> what is the ubuntu equivalent of scandisk and defrag
[07:19] <elite_hacker> alecjw: I just need the "Server install CD", right?
[07:19] <ragnar_123> how do I see the cpu frequency from ubuntu (dapper)?
[07:19] <Discerer> yeah, just wondering if you got an IP
[07:19] <alecjw> elite_hacker: no. the laternate install
[07:20] <elite_hacker> oh?
[07:20] <alecjw> *alternate
[07:20] <elite_hacker> well
[07:20] <psycode> Discerer, you know where do i config DNS?
[07:20] <elite_hacker> I'm on the east coast of the united states and I have an intel
[07:20] <elite_hacker> is there a torrent for it?
[07:20] <eneried> hello
[07:20] <alecjw> elite_hacker: yes there is. is that an intel 32 bit?
[07:20] <Discerer> psycode admin->networking
[07:21] <ladydoor> so i was wondering just now whether there's a way to toggle the default behavior of ls. i've checked the manual and the info doc but didn't see this. In ubuntu, ls tends to just list things in alpha order, ignoring dots and not considering capitals to be different from lowercase. however, i know that I've had times in which it would be useful to see capitals first (such as README) and in which it would be nice to have dotfiles l
[07:21] <ladydoor> isted last. any ideas?
[07:21] <psycode> Discerer, ah, i only have a shell :\
[07:21] <eneried> I need to know where are saved the repositories list in the system?
[07:21] <Discerer> hmm can't remember the command
[07:21] <Discerer> network-settings or something
[07:21] <psycode> anyone know the commands i can use to configure default gateway / dns name servers?
[07:22] <alecjw> elite_hacker: sorry. my geography isn't that good. is the usa north america?
[07:22] <elite_hacker> yes
[07:22] <elite_hacker> nevermind
[07:22] <elite_hacker> i got it
[07:22] <warkruid> psycode: for dns edit resolv.conf
[07:22] <elite_hacker> i just didn't see the 'alternate' cd
[07:22] <alecjw> elite_hacker:  http://mirrors.csumb.edu/ubuntu/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[07:22] <Wolf-h26> hello
[07:22] <elite_hacker> thanks
[07:22] <Wolf-h26> i'm new to ubuntu
[07:22] <alecjw> assuming that you have a 32 bit instel and the usa is north america
[07:23] <warkruid> psycode: gateway is set in ifconfig command.
[07:23] <psycode> warkruid, thanks, the dns seems fine though.. is there something similiar to windows's "default gateway"? cause i know i need to change that..
[07:23] <eneried> i added a DVD of ubuntu edgy on the system, i know there's a folder where info about packages inside that CD is placed, but, where is that folder??
[07:23] <Crayden> psycode: If you're not comfortable with the 'Networking' utilitt from the system menu, try editing /etc/resolv.conf for DNS, and 'route' for adding/removing gateways (ie. 'route add default gw 10.0.0.1' will make 10.0.0.1 your default gateway)
[07:23] <alecjw> Wolf-h26: welcome to ubuntu! :)
[07:23] <Wolf-h26> Ubuntu destoyed my windows habits,loll :)
[07:23] <Wolf-h26> thanks
[07:23] <Guest12925> turkey turkey
[07:23] <Guest12925> :D
[07:23] <warkruid> psycode: in the ifconfig command forgot the exact syntax.
[07:24] <Guest12925>  love ubuntu :D
[07:24] <Crayden> psycode: just plain 'route' shows the routing table, and you can also use 'ifconfig' (ie. ifconfig eth0) to view and edit IP settings for the ethernet card
[07:24] <psycode> Crayden, warkruid, thanks i'll try that...
[07:25] <jachyra> hi, how can I set up Ubuntu to load a module on startup?
[07:25] <eneried> somebody help me! i need some help on synaptic
[07:25] <Daemonn> tell us what's your problem
[07:25] <lsdmt> whats the easiest way to remove a folder with a bunch of subfolders?
[07:25] <VigoFuse> awe heck, I will just install it, if pooter explodes, I have a fire extinguisher.
[07:25] <psycode> Crayden, am i supposed to "reset" my networking or something to make changes apply?
[07:25] <Wolf-h26> I think i'm gonna hang here for a while
[07:25] <VigoFuse> Thank you kindly
[07:25] <lsdmt> I partially installed wine and can't get remove ~/.wine
[07:26] <Crayden> psycode: No need for that, no
[07:26] <warkruid> psycode: OOPS its the route command . route add default <gateway> metric 1
[07:26] <david_> lsdmt: rm -rf FOLDER (but be careful, this is permanent delete)
[07:26] <Daemonn> lsdmt: use sudo
[07:26] <roryy> ladydoor: one possibility is 'LANG=C ls' to get capital letters first; possibly (probably?) won't support utf-8 filenames, though, and is clunky to boot
[07:26] <Crayden> psycode: ..of course, you need to be root to do anything with that stuff.
[07:26] <ladydoor> roryy: hmmm...oh well
[07:26] <psycode> Crayden, yes i'm aware to that ;)
[07:26] <LinuxHelp> Is there a delay, from when you turn on your computer, to when cron starts executing say, cron.hourly? i.e. Would I be correct in saying that it always waits an initial hour before cron.hourly gets executed? I also have anacron installed, and that seems to have a delay of a few minutes when executing overdue scripts, but I'd like to confirm that there is at least a few minutes delay?
[07:26] <lsdmt> david_,  thanks alot man
[07:26] <roryy> ladydoor: maybe   alias ls='LANG=C.utf8 ls'
[07:27] <Os390> hi, i execute any command in mysql and obtain this error -> ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
[07:27] <eneried> i said it before, but, ok again: i added a edgy DVD, it appears on repositories list, ok? i after that added an edubunty edgy DVD, but i can't see it on the repositories list, i opened sources.list but the file is not there
[07:27] <merc> when ubuntu loads gdm, i first get that ugly brown solid color, then it changes to my gdm login image...  is there a way to make the ugly brown solid color, black, so it is less noticeable?
[07:27] <digiqq> hey guys, I was trying to install the latest version of GAIM, how come the protocol list is EMPTY???
[07:27] <david_> lsdmt: fyi, rm is the remove command, -r tells it to be recursive (delete subfiles/folders) and -f tells it to force (not prompt for confirmation)
[07:27] <ladydoor> roryy: hmmm, i'll try that. i'd probably alias it as lc or something so that it wouldn't have to be all the time.
[07:27] <Wolf-h26> guys,how do I install flash 9?I can't view this website http://sonic.sega.jp/sonic/
[07:28] <psycode> Crayden, are you sure no software reset is needed? like in windows i would do "renew ip"
[07:28] <eneried> Wolf-h26 i know there's a flash 9 beta for ubuntu, you add the repository or download the .deb file
[07:28] <digiqq> Wolf-h26: just go to www.adobe.com, and you will see the install button
[07:28] <roryy> ladydoor: it kind of bugs me too; I'm used to seeing INSTALL and Makefile and all those first in the listing
[07:28] <KerLeone> Hi, I am totally new in linux and dont get my ubuntu installed. I start from cd, choose "start and install" and then it starts, but after someminutes I get a blue screen saying "Failed to start x-server" and the log file says "no screens found".
[07:28] <jason0_> Anyone know why I would get "invalid driver!" from ndiswrapper? The driver previously worked with no problems.
[07:28] <digiqq> hey guys, I was trying to install the latest version of GAIM, how come the protocol list is EMPTY???
[07:29] <ladydoor> roryy: yeah...and Emac's dired is kind of a pain in my home dir ATM, but that's ok
[07:29] <Crayden> psycode: Changing the routing table, editing the resolv.conf for DNS and changing the IP address of the network card - none of these need a restart/reset
[07:29] <eneried> ah, ok, bye, nobody can or want to help me here
[07:29] <ladydoor> *Emacs's
[07:29] <kmaynard> eneried, you get flash 9 from adobe directly
[07:29] <wts> eneried, it is available on the adobe website
[07:30] <adieu> how does this chatroom work i have  a problem and nobody cares
[07:30] <Crayden> psycode: If you're having problems, maybe there's another route setting that's conflicting with the one you just set.  If you want to change your IP you just have to do 'ifconfig eth0 up 10.0.0.100' to get that ip, and that's it
[07:30] <roryy> ladydoor: i'm sure you know about Dired-Omit mode, but if not it's worth looking at
[07:30] <wts> eneried, just follow the directions in the file that you download, really easy
[07:30] <digiqq> hey guys, I was trying to install the latest version of GAIM, how come the protocol list is EMPTY???
[07:30] <wts> adieu, what is your issue?
[07:30] <ladydoor> roryy: i'll check it out
[07:31] <olifozzy> hi
[07:31] <kmaynard> adieu, if you dont get an answer, it's possible no one who's paying attention at the moment  knows. whining and berating won't help
[07:31] <jachyra> how can I setup Ubuntu to load a module on startup?
[07:31] <Wolf-h26> how do I install flash?
[07:31] <wts> digiqq, saying the same thing over and over might cause someone that might help you to ignore you
[07:31] <kmaynard> digiqq, install the package or from source?
[07:31] <wts> !flashbeta
[07:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about flashbeta - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:31] <psycode> Crayden, no it's not that, it seems like a dns issue since directly targeting google's ip answers to ping

[07:32] <lsdmt> david_, another quick question man, i'm trying to install ATI driver fo xpress 200 series and am following 32 bit instructions to load on amd64 so i have to edit the commands a bit. Do i need to edit "sudo dpkg -i xorg-driver-fglrx_8.26.18-1_i386.deb" to "sudo dpkg -i xorg-driver-fglrx_8.26.18-1_i386_64.deb " ?
[07:32] <digiqq> wts: sorry
[07:32] <kmaynard> digiqq, if it's not an official ubuntu build, then you may want to ask the gaim people
[07:32] <Wolf-h26> I give up,lol
[07:32] <kmaynard> it might be a known bug
[07:32] <fryfrog> can anyone tell me why ubuntu is running dd?  root      4285 89.0  0.0   1724   512 ?        Rs   14:24   9:18 /bin/dd bs 1 if /proc/kmsg of /var/run/klogd/kmsg
[07:32] <kmaynard> Wolf-h26, dude...it's not hard
[07:33] <Wolf-h26> I got the installer
[07:33] <Crayden> psycode: but pinging google.com instead of the ip doesn't work...  Does 'cat /etc/resolv.conf' spit out the right DNS servers?
[07:33] <shwag> does cron run jobs as root ?
[07:33] <Wolf-h26> but don't know that to do
[07:33] <digiqq> kmaynard: okie, I think I better go to gaim forum for help. thx anyway mate~
[07:33] <psycode> Crayden, yes and yes... i know it's odd :P
[07:33] <Crayden> psycode: there should be single lines, each reading "nameserver 123.123.123.124'
[07:33] <fryfrog> shwag: i'm sure it can?
[07:33] <Crayden> hmh :/
[07:33] <psycode> Crayden, yup
[07:33] <olifozzy> does someone know about a security flaw in the vnc module for x server ?
[07:33] <digiqq> Wolf-h26: just go to www.adobe.com and install the plugin
[07:33] <Crayden> psycode: And you get a ping reply from the DNS servers?
[07:34] <david_> lsdmt: I have not installed fglrx on a 64 bit system, so I might be wrong, but I believe that drivers are only for 32 bit systems.  If you have the .deb that supports 64 bit (that is, it will end with i386_64 rather than i386_32), then you should be able to use dpkg -i [file]  to install it.  If it doesn't work, you can always remove it (thank god)
[07:34] <kmaynard> Wolf-h26, just copy libflash.so (whatever it's called) into the firefox plugins directory...it's in /usr/ somewhere, do some googling
[07:34] <shwag> fryfrog: if you are sure then why did you put a ? at the end
[07:34] <bipolar> Does anyone know where I can find an *up to date* howto on getting aiglx/beryl working on edgy with the latest nvidia drivers? Everything google returns was written before the nvidia drivers supported AIGLX.

[07:34] <apokryphos> !beryl | bipolar
[07:34] <ubotu> bipolar: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl

[07:34] <kmarius> just a quick question ... how do I enable sound for _all_ users in ubuntu?

[07:34] <fryfrog> shwag: also, i wasn't sure if you were directing it to me in relation to my dd question or not

[07:39] <bunnythebunny> forward*
[07:39] <shape> but furing installation synaptic gives me a message error
[07:39] <zoetrope666> umm, kind of
[07:39] <LjL> bunnythebunny, forward it to another computer?
[07:39] <[erisco] > kmaynard, any ideas?
[07:39] <matju> just to make sure, is there "Flash player 8" for any kind of Linux? Adobe seems to be only providing version 7, but some sites require version 8, and redirect to the download page, which offers me version 7, which i already have...
[07:39] <andersg> Crayden: So I basically need to install a whole lot of windows codecs to hopefully get the right one?
[07:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell matju about flash9
[07:40] <carlo> I've done what is said in the unnoficcial ubuntu guide, but all that I get is cranky sound, no 5.1
[07:40] <kmaynard> [erisco] , sudo updatedb && locate ubuntu*.iso
[07:40] <bunnythebunny> LjL, No, I want to use utorrent and, i've configured my router...and the port is still given to me as "not open" by the site. Im presuming iptables is to blame...
[07:40] <LjL> bunnythebunny, no. it's your router's settings to blame
[07:40] <wts> matju, there is a beta version of flash9 a quick search on google for flash beta 9 linux will get you to the page
[07:40] <Crayden> andersg:  Not necessarily.  I'm not very familiar with the codecs part, but the page that user guy just linked you to (if you missed it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats) can probably help you there
[07:40] <LjL> bunnythebunny, Ubuntu doesn't come with any ports firewalled by default.
[07:40] <zoetrope666> wts: should i follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam even though its a generic one?
[07:41] <jmx> yo.
[07:41] <LjL> bunnythebunny, you might have to open the port for UDP as well as TCP perhaps, though i'm not familiar with bittorrent
[07:41] <wts> zoetrope666, do you know how to use the terminal?
[07:41] <zoetrope666> wts: to a degree, yes

[07:41] <bunnythebunny> So, this is odd.

[07:46] <dxdemetriou> LjL, yes. I mean other programs than gtk2
[07:46] <bunnythebunny> zoetrope666: Its annoying like hell. It started to happen after i configured my system surround to work.
[07:46] <zoetrope666> bunnythebunny: no idea how to fix it, sorry. tell me if you do!
[07:46] <jmx> I dont now what realtek is lol
[07:46] <LjL> dxdemetriou, i'm not sure that's achievable
[07:46] <dxdemetriou> LjL, when I start with Greek is ok
[07:46] <finsta> Realtek makes chipsets for LAN and Audio
[07:46] <wts> jmx, you would have to use the 32bit version of your browser

[07:47] <LjL> dxdemetriou: try typing "locale" in a shell. you could probably try playing with those variables (and then starting those non-working programs from the same shell)
[07:48] <bunnythebunny> zoetrope666: I got ubuntu 6.10...and god damn...its making my blood boil.....i like that in a way.

[07:55] <poulap> hmmm. no luck with alsamixer for my sound on toshiba sat p100
[07:55] <bunnythebunny> Williamts99: I know! flash has a problem for 64 bits hasnt it?
[07:55] <Williamts99> yes it does
[07:56] <bunnythebunny> zoetrope666: will do, if i find it first, ill tell you
[07:56] <Deathi> h
[07:56] <jmx> I cant install flash cause I have wrong architexture damn
=== deema is now known as deema-
[07:57] <Williamts99> jmx, there are workarounds but the best would be to use the 32bit version of Ubuntu
[07:57] <bunnythebunny> jmx: just get i386.
[07:57] <zoetrope666> bunnythebunny - cool, thanks!
[07:57] <Deathi> anyoe here who can help me?  i have a problem  installing an  build environment
[07:57] <Akuma_> is there some user friendly, samba wrapping tool for setting up filesharing? the samba documentation is the most cryptic one i've seen. some kind of wizzard would actually be nice
[07:58] <jmx> ok this flash says i386
[07:58] <jmx> i386.deb
[07:58] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, SWAT
[07:58] <zoetrope666> has anyone used the amor cat thingo?? i turned the cat purple and 3D in gimp :D so proud. hehe
[07:58] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: seems like a good idea, but i can't get it to work. the docs are the same..
[07:58] <Williamts99> jmx, no the 32 bit version of Ubuntu
=== borg is now known as botxj
[07:59] <LinuxHelp>  Akuma_, setting up samba is easy as pie
[07:59] <Williamts99> instead of the 64bit version, that deb won't work on your system if you are using the 64bit version of Ubuntu
[07:59] <jmx> OK I as you kow from yester and not good with linux. is 32 bit not ..well not asgood as 64
[07:59] <LinuxHelp> LinuxHelp, Akuma_ what cant you get right?
[07:59] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: that's good news. but guessing how to do it isn't ... do you know of a simple tutorial then?
[07:59] <dope12345> my wireless keeps coming on and off
[07:59] <_3fg> Hey, every time I log into Ubuntu, it just sits at a brown screen.
[08:00] <abarbaccia> hello all - can someone let me know where to place a script to get it to run at every login
[08:00] <dope12345> my wireless light keeps coming on and off when in ubuntu
[08:00] <dope12345> wtfizzle?
[08:00] <LinuxHelp>  Akuma_ not off hand no, sorry
[08:00] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: i just dont even know where to start. i installed the package, the deamons started automatically, and then what?
[08:00] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
[08:00] <_3fg> abarbaccia: http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
[08:01] <Quovadis> ki
[08:01] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: im in there .. that's the cryptic part i'm mostly talking about =) i don't understand 10% of it
[08:01] <deema_> anybody here use Prism54 islsm?
[08:01] <fowlduck> how do I change the default group of a user so that all files and directories they create belong to that user?
[08:01] <elvirolo> hi all
[08:01] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, lets start with what you want to accomplish?
[08:01] <elvirolo> i'm having a prob with edgy : sound doesn't work with flash
[08:01] <abarbaccia> _3fg, at login, not at bootup
[08:01] <abarbaccia> gnome
[08:02] <zoetrope666> .
[08:02] <EmxBA> hi
[08:02] <david__> Hi
[08:02] <elvirolo> can anyone help me ?
[08:02] <EmxBA> alsa unexpectedly gives me lots of noise, any solutions?
[08:02] <zoetrope666> hi :)
[08:02] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: i have this ubuntu pc, and a winxp pc. they are both on a lan, sharing internet, but i want to enable filesharing between the two
[08:02] <EmxBA> ubotu, please tell Akuma_ about samba
[08:03] <_3fg> abarbaccia: ah
[08:03] <Akuma_> EmxBA: i know about samba, thanks. want i want to know is how to make it work
[08:03] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, they both need to read each others files?
[08:03] <jake_-> anyone know how to fix fatal error when doing modprobe acer_acpi ?
[08:03] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: read write would be nice, yeah
[08:03] <david__> I'm got a problem with the screen resolution, it won't go above 800x600
[08:03] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: both ways
[08:03] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_ ah
[08:03] <deema_> anybody here use Prism54 islsm?
[08:03] <EmxBA> david__: edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:04] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, the samba server will let your windows xp machine read your /home/Akuma_/ dir.
[08:04] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, and for reading your windows xp machine from your ubuntu one, I'd say just use the gnome built in stuff
[08:04] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: well thats a start
[08:04] <EmxBA> can someone help me with sound/alsa? card is hda nvidia and chipset is realtek alc880
[08:04] <david__> I've got various entries in xconf but only get 2 options
[08:05] <Williamts99> jmx, sent you a PM
[08:05] <EmxBA> do you have something like Modeline in Screen section? david__?
[08:05] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, www.rafb.net and paste the contents of your /etc/samba/smb.conf
[08:06] <carlo> help please, I cant get surround working :(
[08:06] <david__> Several all start with Depth, the default is 24
[08:06] <_3fg> abarbaccia: http://club.mandriva.com/xwiki/bin/view/KB/XwinXset
[08:06] <_3fg> abarbaccia: find "Running Scripts Automatically"
[08:06] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: http://rafb.net/paste/results/gfBEuP81.html
[08:06] <_3fg> it says it works for every session
[08:06] <Xenguy> Hi - if I add a UID to /etc/group, but want to activate that change without logging out/in again, is there a command to re-initialize /etc/group  ?
[08:07] <Senesence> When I copy files to my usb thumb drive from my home directory, the usb drive doesn't detect the changes. Why is this?
[08:07] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: i wasnt aware gnome has something builtin for reading winxp shares .. in fact i wasnt aware it required different tools ... newbe me
[08:07] <Ignite_> Does anyone know anything about Deluge development? For some reason I can't post on their forum (which is hosted by Ubuntu) and I can't find any other contact info...
[08:07] <_3fg> I need to reinstall from  the live CD. Should I use 6.06 or 6.10?
[08:07] <_3fg> Are there any problems with 6.10?
[08:08] <EmxBA> _3fg: to reinstall what?
[08:08] <_3fg> the whole OS
[08:08] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, look at the [homes]  section
[08:08] <EmxBA> ah
[08:08] <Durtro> tell me
[08:08] <EmxBA> _3fg: and you're using 6.06 now?
[08:08] <_3fg> yes
[08:08] <Ignite_> _3fg: why do you need to reinstall the whole OS? O.o
[08:08] <EmxBA> i would do a fresh edgy install
[08:08] <deema_> anybody here use Prism54 islsm?
[08:08] <LinuxHelp> Akuma, it would seem that you *should* be able to log in from your windows pc right now
[08:08] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: yeah ...
[08:08] <EmxBA> !repeat > deema_
[08:08] <_3fg> Ignite_: it's just hanging at the brown screen after login
[08:09] <EmxBA> you don't need to reinstall
[08:09] <Senesence> Does anyone know anything about solving USB flash drive oriented problems? I need help on the matter.
[08:09] <_3fg> the mouse moves, it even goes into screensaver after a few minutes
[08:09] <EmxBA> br
[08:09] <Ignite_> I agree with EmxBA.
[08:09] <EmxBA> _3fg: you don't get wallpaper or?
[08:09] <_3fg> no wallpaper
[08:09] <_3fg> just the splash screen
[08:09] <EmxBA> no icons?
[08:09] <_3fg> nope
[08:09] <_3fg> right click does nothing, no toolbar
[08:10] <EmxBA> what have you done recently? :)
[08:10] <_3fg> not used linux for 2 months ;)
[08:10] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, just open my computer and type \\server\username
[08:10] <DJAdmiral> Hey - issue about preferred applications here - how do I set Quark Music Player as my default music player?
[08:10] <_3fg> actually, I always hit ctrl-c to skip "Configure network devices"
[08:10] <EmxBA> damn it, this alsa noise gets really irritating
[08:10] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, also remember you may have to enter the ip address manually
[08:10] <carlo> I have a 5.1 surround card and I cant get audio playback from the subwoofer! help please!
[08:10] <DJAdmiral> Akuma_: Have we met before? Nicole?
[08:10] <Akuma_> DJAdmiral: nop
[08:11] <abarbaccia> _3fg, closer - but doesn't solve my original problem - i have many people logging in and out and I need it done at every login and logout and don't want to set it up manually to do that for each user
[08:11] <DJAdmiral> Akuma_: *sigh* Thanks anyway.
[08:11] <_3fg> but now I have a an ethernet cable plugged in and I previously just had a PCI card
[08:11] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_: e.g. \\10.0.0.8\linuxhelp
[08:11] <ragnar_123> how do I see the cpu frequency from ubuntu (dapper)?
[08:11] <EmxBA> ragnar_123: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[08:11] <js_> does edgy support for ich8?
[08:11] <_3fg> abarbaccia: hm, I'm lost then
[08:11] <ragnar_123> thanks
[08:11] <DJAdmiral> How do I set up Quark as my default music player, or for that matter, how do I set any music player as the default?
[08:11] <abarbaccia> _3fg, as am i lol
[08:11] <_3fg> EmxBA, Ignite_, any ideas?
[08:12] <Senesence> Is there any support people around?
[08:12] <EmxBA> _3fg: reinstall os if you really need to
[08:12] <DJAdmiral> Senesence: We're all here to help :)
[08:12] <EmxBA> Senesence: yes, what's the problem? ;-)
[08:12] <_3fg> ok
[08:12] <Senesence> USB flash drive won't detect changes (when I copy files to it)
[08:12] <_3fg> and I saw that Edgy was recommended
[08:12] <_3fg> thanks all
[08:13] <jmx> OK where can I get i286?
[08:13] <DJAdmiral> !quark
[08:13] <EmxBA> Senesence: how do you mean won't detect changes? after you copied the files, do a right click on usb icon on desktop and do "remove" or something similar, dunno now
[08:13] <ubotu> quark: music player daemon controlled from the gnome panel or cli. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.21-3.1build1 (edgy), package size 40 kB, installed size 192 kB
[08:13] <LinuxHelp> jmx, iThink thats deprecated
[08:13] <_3fg> now for the big question: Shoud I do xubuntu, kubuntu, or just stick with Gnome
[08:13] <EmxBA> but it really reminds me to windows xp, Senesence :)
[08:13] <CarlFK> if someone needs a 64 bit version of libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 - can they just apt-get source and dpkg-buildpackage it to make a 64 bit deb?
[08:14] <EmxBA> _3fg: depends on what you like
[08:14] <Senesence> EmxBA: All the files that Ubuntu registers as on the flash drive, are no longer there when I unmount it and mount it again.
[08:14] <EmxBA> gnome is nice for most of us
[08:14] <deema_> how do I enable modules?
[08:14] <DJAdmiral> _3fg: It's just a matter of preference. You can have KDE and Gnome working on Ubuntu at the same time.
[08:14] <LinuxHelp> _3fg, I vote for gnome
[08:15] <EmxBA> Senesence: they must be there if you unmount it correctly
[08:15] <Ignite_> I wiped GNOME off here the other day to install KDE... now I want GNOME back... GTK development is so much nicer than QT...
[08:15] <_3fg> Gnome it is ;)
[08:15] <jmx> ?
[08:15] <jmx> I mean i386
[08:15] <DJAdmiral> _3fg: Hint - Ubuntu is gnome, but Kubuntu is KDE. It's not Gubuntu for Gnome, so it kinda proves that Gnome > KDE lol
[08:15] <suga_bear_> f
[08:15] <Senesence> EmxBA: Is there any way to configure ubuntu to make all the changes instantly, instead of doing it on unmount?
[08:15] <thingy> Senesence: sync
[08:15] <PupenoRG> In Evolution, how do I apply a filter to mails that I have already downloaded ?
[08:16] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: Reinstall ubuntu-desktop?
[08:16] <Senesence> thingy: ? please clarify.
[08:16] <suga_bear_> does anyone know if dapper has the kernel that will allow it to become an access point?
[08:16] <thingy> Senesence: er wait I assume you mean't you want to commit all hard disk writes to disk?
[08:16] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: And you can have Gnome and KDE running side by side on ubuntu.
[08:16] <jmx> whats the diff between 32 bit ubuntu and 64 bit ubuntu
[08:16] <EmxBA> Senesence: well, when you copy those files (and the usb is still plugged) check that they are on the usb stick, and then clearly unmnount it
[08:16] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: with \\192.168.0.3\martin  it asks for a username/password .. but it wont be let in
[08:16] <EmxBA> but it should work without the nice unmounting (i've tried it  :) )
[08:16] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: I was just making a comment in relation to my view on KDE for _3fg, I don't need advice, thanks anyway though, and I know, I've been using GNU+Linux since I was 11. :-P
[08:17] <DJAdmiral> jmx: 32 bit ubuntu is meant for normal PCs, but 64 bit is meant for 64bit processors.
[08:17] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, you entered "marting" for your username, and your correct password right?
[08:17] <LinuxHelp> *-g
[08:17] <jmx> OK whick would you say is better?
[08:17] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: So have I :P
[08:17] <Ignite_> :-D
[08:17] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: How old are you?
[08:17] <Senesence> EmxBA: Looking at the contents of the usb drive through nautilus GUI, the files are all there. But when I take the drive out and plug it back in it's like nothing was ever created or copied. Get it?
[08:17] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: 16.
[08:18] <thingy> Senesence: ok I just read the above messages...you are loosing files when copying files to a flash drive....to solve this...after copying the files...in a console type in "sync" a couple of times and it will commit the stuff in buffers onto the medium
[08:18] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: the username-passwd i use to log on to ubuntu, yes. it rewrites the username to COMPNAME/username
[08:18] <deema_> how do I enable modules?
[08:18] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: 5 years, impressive. I just turned 17 yesterday. Been using Linux for 2 years now, and I've made my own linux distro, so I'm happy :D
[08:18] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, um.... try the "smbpasswd" program on your linux machine
[08:18] <Ignite_> :-D
[08:18] <Senesence> thingy: Is there any way to configure ubuntu to do that automatically?
[08:18] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: what's your distro called?
[08:18] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, run it as "martin"
[08:18] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: It's called Aamix.
[08:19] <jmx> What would you say is better...32 or 64 bit?
[08:19] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: and happy birthday for yesterday. :-)
[08:19] <Williamts99> jmx, I sent you a PM
[08:19] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: I haven't posted it on the net :P
[08:19] <jmx> yes williamts
[08:19] <jmx> your not talking though
[08:19] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: oh I see. :P
[08:19] <thingy> Senesence: My understanding was that if you right click the flash device's icon on the desktop and choose to eject it...it will automatically sync before unmounting. Is this not happening?
[08:19] <LinuxHelp> I think there are far too many linux distros
[08:19] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Can you help it if it's open source?
[08:19] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: $ Old SMB password
[08:20] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Different people have different needs and wants
[08:20] <Senesence> thingy: My understanding was that taking the flashdrive out would do an automatic unmount.
[08:20] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Many open source projects branch out a lot. Linux is the biggest example.
[08:20] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, er try "sudo smbpasswd martin" ?
[08:20] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, be creative
[08:20] <DJAdmiral> Senesence: Not a good idea to just yank out the USB stick
[08:21] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, BIG waste of resources
[08:21] <CarlFK> what is and apt/sources.list line for debian experimental?
[08:21] <Ignite_> Linux doesn't branch out a lot, for that to be true there would be more than one kernel based on linux, or lots for that matter, yes there are a lot of modded ones, but none who try to become kernels on their own, not that I know of. :-)
[08:21] <thingy> Senesence: NO!! Do not physically unplug any flash usb devices. You have to eject it! This is the same in Windows!
[08:21] <Senesence> DJAdmiral: Well I do wait for the folders to show up on the drive when I copy them from the home dir.
[08:21] <Comrade_S> Senesence:  just umount the drive name
[08:21] <DJAdmiral> Senesence: STILL not a good idea. Background processes, things working in the background, etc.
[08:22] <Senesence> thingy: I want ubuntu to write things right at the time I make the copy command. Is there a way to do that?
[08:22] <LinuxHelp> Senesence, and then wait five seconds
[08:22] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: This branching out?
[08:22] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, !this ?
[08:22] <Ignite_> Senesence: right click the drive and choose eject, that will finish writing data to the drive so you can remove it. :)
[08:22] <Comrade_S> Senesence:  or basically, right click on the usb drive icon on desktop and click on eject
[08:22] <CarlFK> Senesence: yes.  but i forget how :)
[08:22] <Senesence> Guys, in windows this works without having to do any of this
[08:22] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Linux wouldn't be so popular if there wouldn't be so many distros.
[08:22] <thingy> Senesence: Think about this...the device you are copying too is slow to write data to its medium...and so that data is bufferred in memory. This is why copying will seem fast to you but in reality writing the buffered data takes time and happens slowly.
[08:22] <DJAdmiral> Senesence: Linux is not windoze.
[08:22] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: awesome. this worked. i'll read up on smbpasswd though, i'm not too sure what happened. thank's a lot eh, i apreciate
[08:22] <Seyen> Hey guys. Can comeone point a complete newb how to change the resolution to something not listed in the System->Preferences->Screen Resolution?
[08:22] <CarlFK> Senesence: not really.  unless by "works" you mean "screw up your data"
[08:23] <Ignite_> Senesence: you can change that in Ubuntu, I'm not sure how in GNOME though, sorry. :)
[08:23] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, nope wrong way round, there are so many distros because linux is so popular
[08:23] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: btw, whats the name of the gnome builtin app for reading the windows shares?
[08:23] <Senesence> thingy: It takes like 5 minutes. In windows it was instant. I'm talking low memory files here .txt, nothing big to require that much time
[08:23] <Comrade_S> Akuma_:  samba
[08:23] <Comrade_S> ?
[08:23] <CarlFK> Senesence: in win, it tries to make it easy, but ends up letting people trash things instead of making dam sure all is good.
[08:23] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: I would disagree. How did it get so popular in the first place?
[08:23] <LinuxHelp>  Akuma_ do a synaptic search for samba gnome
[08:23] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, slackware?
[08:24] <malefico> hi, I'm trying to install Edgy on compaq presario laptop and run into this same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1614142&postcount=5 , anybody here knows how to fix it ?
[08:24] <Senesence> CarlFK: In windows when you copy files, and they show up in the USB window they are there
[08:24] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: There were other distros then.
[08:24] <CarlFK> Senesence: it is why the mac doesn't have an eject button on the floppy drive
[08:24] <CarlFK> Senesence: "basicaly" yes, really no.
[08:24] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: And as it is people are giving their own resources towards their own distros. It's not really a 'waste' as you would call it.
[08:24] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_ its like a vfs module for something like that
[08:25] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Different distros address different needs, wants, and styles. Therefore it is so popular.
[08:25] <CarlFK> Senesence: in w2kl you had to "eject" or whatever and it would thow a dialog if you didn't.  XP improved it, but you can still trash it.
[08:25] <Senesence> CarlFK: Well, I really had my files on the usb drive when I put them there with windows. So you
[08:26] <CarlFK> Senesence: that's the "basicaly" I mentioned. most of the time you are fine. the question is: how often do you want to trash your files?  is once a year ok?
[08:26] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, most distros just plain suck though.. and still so many people use them. I think I should be appointed LinuxManager and be allowed to veto bad distributions or something
[08:26] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: So how long have you been with Ubuntu?
[08:26] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: hmm, there's ubuntu-system-tools .. includes network config and nfs samba shares tools. i'll give it a try i guess
[08:26] <Seyen> Hey guys. Can comeone point a complete newb how to change the resolution to something not listed in the System->Preferences->Screen Resolution? I sure as heck know my card and monitor support them. everything is blurry on LCD with non-native resolution :\
[08:26] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, that doesnt sound right
[08:26] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_ it'll be gnome- something
[08:27] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Then it would be more of a bureaucratic dictation rather than an open source community. You'd piss a lot of people off.
[08:27] <kmarius> how do i enable sound for _all_ users in ubuntu? my sound card already works for the first user that I created
[08:27] <Senesence> CarlFK: I make concurrent backups so it's ok for me. I just want ubuntu to start writing files to the USB drive as soon as I copy them, thats all
[08:27] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: about a year, I used to install every distro I could find purely for cureosity, but now I need a stable system I know won't need much work, so I use Ubuntu. (because now I have responsibilities. :-() :P
[08:27] <DJAdmiral> Seyen: Custom resolutions, you want to reconfigure the X Server, but if you're a complete newb...
[08:27] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, well I'd go so far as to say that successful distrobutions are run using corporate style management anyway
[08:27] <CarlFK> Senesence: like I said, there is a way to turn off the buffering.  i just foget how
[08:27] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, so I would be so far off from the current system
[08:28] <LinuxHelp> *wouldnt
[08:28] <thingy> Senesence: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=245962&highlight=usb+flash+sync   Looks like this does what you want!
[08:28] <Ignite_> You cannot define success by the amount of users LinuxHelp.
[08:28] <LinuxHelp>  Ignite_, I define success by the word "apt" :P
[08:28] <Seyen> DJAdmiral: No, not "custom", just not listed in the dialog. Biggest res in the dialog is 1024x768.
[08:28] <roryy> Senesence: unfortunately you'll need to remember to manually unmount the usb stick.  According to 'man mount', synchronous writing to disk (more-or-less what you want) is only supported for some filesystems, not including FAT (the usual usb stick filesystem).
[08:28] <Seyen> DJAdmiral: I need 1280x1024
[08:29] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: You might think that one distro is 'absolutely useless' when in fact somebody else just might find it perfect.
[08:29] <thingy> Senesence: Read the full thread...as there are warnings in their that you should heed.
[08:29] <Flats> Does Ubuntu support any type of Twain driver for document scanning with an HP scanner?
[08:29] <dxdemetriou> LjL, It doesn't work the locale. I made all export in bashrc without luck. the only think I hope to do is to disable the translation of gnome. anyway, thanks
[08:29] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: gsambad ?
[08:29] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, tell me what is good about fedora core? What niche does it fill?
[08:29] <Jimbo> n00b here..day 5 since I first looked at linux    >I finally figured out how to compile and install that pan beta 0.119 newsreader(supports nzb files). I now have a package installer in the folder. I notice the tar.gz file is only about 1.9 mb, while the folder I extracted it to, and I guess contains the files used to compile is now 114 mb (why so large?). If i want to use the package installer on another machine do I need to keep the whole folder containing 114
[08:29] <Senesence> thingy: Finally, thanks alot, i'll be sure to read through it
[08:29] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, I'll do a proper search myself now, just wait
[08:29] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: It fills the niche of people who want to give Red Hat a shot but don't want to pay for it.
[08:29] <fryfrog> Does anyone know where moduel options are stored?  I need to set "options" for the lirc_serial module, as well as a "pre-install" line.  In Gentoo, it would be /etc/modules.d/lirc or lirc_serial
[08:30] <DJAdmiral> Seyen: In either case you'll need to reconfigure X.
[08:30] <fryfrog> I thought it was /etc/modutils/lirc or lirc_serial in Ubuntu, but this doesn't seem to change what io/irq lirc_serial is using
[08:30] <Seyen> Uhh.. errr.. command for that?
[08:30] <LinuxHelp> DJAdmiral, well let me put this a different way: what niche does Red Hat fill?
[08:30] <Flats> !twain
[08:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about twain - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:31] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_ libgnomevfs2-extra
[08:31] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: Red Hat serves the corporate server and broad database management niche. Red Hat has 80% of the Linux market share.
[08:31] <fryfrog> LinuxHelp: red hat fills the corporate world that *requires* available paid support and personel
[08:31] <thingy> fryfrog:  module options should go in a file in /etc/modprobe.d
[08:31] <fryfrog> ah, modprobe.d
[08:31] <DJAdmiral> Ignite_: Welcome back to the Jedi :P
[08:31] <HumanPrototype> hi, what is in /var?
[08:31] <thingy> fryfrog: you will need to create your own file for your module in there..
[08:31] <fryfrog> thingy: do i have to do anything to regenerate cache of this?  or is it auto-magic?
[08:31] <fryfrog> in gentoo, i'd need to "modules-update"
[08:31] <LinuxHelp> fryfrog, so theres not much to be said about their distro, just their support?
[08:32] <DJAdmiral> HumanPrototype: The Help pages should be able to help you out with that, but basicallly it's just for logs.
[08:32] <hoehaver> can someone help me.
[08:32] <Jimbo> LinuxHelp: can you clarify this for me....new to linux >I finally figured out how to compile and install that pan beta 0.119 newsreader(supports nzb files).

[08:32] <roryy> HumanPrototype: important things one usually shouldn't fiddle with
[08:32] <hoehaver> my source list is um....fucked
[08:32] <thingy> fryfrog: there is an update-modules command but I think its automagic..and you dont need to run it...try it without and with
[08:32] <HumanPrototype> roryy like /var/www?
[08:32] <hoehaver> can someone give me a link to a good source list?
[08:32] <DJAdmiral> hoehaver: Mind your language.
[08:32] <Ignite_> Lol DJAdmiral
[08:32] <fryfrog> LinuxHelp: yeah, there isn't much to be said about redhat... except that they have an ass ton of market share, they are probably the most popular corporate distro and they make money
[08:32] <HumanPrototype> hoehaver, google for source-o-matic
[08:32] <roryy> !sources | boehaver
[08:32] <ubotu> boehaver: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[08:32] <LinuxHelp> Jimbo, I generally stay away from compilations, except for my kernel that is
[08:32] <DJAdmiral> hoehaver: could you pastebin your sources.list?
[08:32] <hoehaver> i will, thank you
[08:33] <Flats> Does Ubuntu support document scanning?
[08:33] <Flats> or any Linux for that matter
[08:33] <Jimbo> LinuxHelp: this was the only way to get the app i wanted as it was beta
[08:33] <roryy> HumanPrototype: indeed, though normal desktop users wouldn't have that.  Do you have a specific reason for asking?
[08:33] <DJAdmiral> Flats: Yes it does
=== Ignite__ is now known as Ignite_
[08:33] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: already installed .. i dont suspect there's an easy-for-newby gui, eh
[08:33] <Flats> DJAdmiral: Pre installed?
[08:33] <hoehaver>  DJAdmiral  yes i will
[08:34] <hoehaver> give me a moment
[08:34] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, click Places, then "Connect to Server"
[08:34] <Ignite_> Yay, now I can issue a few commands on the CLI and spend some time helping people! :-D
[08:34] <HumanPrototype> roryy, im setting up a server and it will server (partly) as a testing server for multiople sites so im mouning /var/www seperatly
[08:34] <Jimbo> do I need to save the whole mess or will the package installer be enuff to install on another linux machine?
[08:34] <fryfrog> thingy: WARNING: /etc/modprobe.d/lirc_serial line 17: ignoring bad line starting with 'pre-install'
[08:34] <fryfrog> er, sorry
[08:34] <link> hi guys, can somebody tell me how to get my HP deskjet printer to work?
[08:34] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_ on your task bar/start menu bar thing
[08:34] <DJAdmiral> Flats: On Ubuntu, yes. I think Xsane image scanner is included.
[08:34] <Flats> sweeeeet
[08:34] <Flats> thank you
[08:34] <HumanPrototype> roryy, and wondered if it was worth mounting /var not just /var/www seperatly
[08:34] <fryfrog> is "pre-install lirc_serial setserial /dev/ttyS0 uart none" not valid in a /etc/modprobe.d/lirc_serial file?
[08:34] <DJAdmiral> Anytime!
[08:35] <Jimbo> anyone know the answer to my question?
[08:35] <roryy> HumanPrototype: i am a strictly amateur-grade sysadmin, but on the one server I run, I have /var mounted on a separate volume
[08:35] <Ignite_> Jimbo: what's your question?
[08:35] <thingy> link: What's the deskjet model number?

[08:35] <thunderstorm> hi
[08:35] <link> <thingy> its a D1360
[08:35] <bombero> hi
[08:35] <Jimbo> total n00b here.. days since first look at nix
[08:35] <HumanPrototype> roryy, im even more amateur but im not too bothered about most logs so it can go on the same / partition
[08:35] <HumanPrototype> /var/www is seperate thop
[08:36] <Ignite_> Jimbo: you will have to see the softwares manual. :P
[08:36] <roryy> HumanPrototype: *shrug* it's up to you, and it's not all that hard to change later on
[08:36] <thunderstorm> :)
[08:36] <Jimbo> manual..i dont think it has a manual
[08:36] <thunderstorm> it has
[08:36] <thunderstorm> check google ;)
[08:36] <Ignite_> Jimbo: try the website or google.
[08:36] <Ignite_> :D
[08:36] <Seyen> How do I restart x.org?
[08:36] <fryfrog> looks like i need to use the "install" option
[08:37] <dope12345> ok i've tried just about everything to get this wireless working. ndiswrapper and bcm-fwcutter
[08:37] <DJAdmiral> Guys I will have to pop off or something - Ignite_, any idea how to set the default music app in Ubuntu?
[08:37] <thunderstorm> you could reboot of course :D
[08:37] <HumanPrototype> Jimbo if ure interested look up man pages on the net
[08:37] <thunderstorm> that's the easy way to restart x.org :)
[08:37] <Jimbo> Ignite: does a package installer generally contain all the files needed for install or does it generally point to the files needed....
[08:37] <Ignite_> Seyen: hit ctrl+alt+f1, login and run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" without the quotes.
[08:37] <Jimbo> man pages???
[08:37] <DJAdmiral> Seyen: Ctrl+Backspace
[08:37] <dope12345> i'm using ndiswrapper now and i add the blacklist line for the bcm43xx but now my wireless network adapter doesn't show up in the networking window
[08:37] <Ignite_> Jimbo: do you mean a ubuntu package, or a custom package from the distributor?
[08:37] <LinuxHelp> Is there any way to run Windows XP on Linux, without paying for commercial VM software? (I have a licensed retail copy of Windows XP though)
[08:37] <DJAdmiral> Seyen: Fastest way is Control Backspace.
[08:38] <Ignite_> DJAdmiral: that's also dirty.
[08:38] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: KQEMU
[08:38] <Jimbo> Ignite: hold on Ill get a link to the appz page
[08:38] <Ignite_> Seyen: that's also dirty.
[08:38] <Ignite_> :P
[08:38] <thunderstorm> I like dirty :)
[08:38] <thunderstorm> dirty is good :)
[08:38] <hoehaver> i dont know how to link the pastebin.com thing so it will go directly to what i pasted..
[08:38] <Ignite_> Jimbo: I'm restricted to the CLI atm.
[08:38] <roryy> DJAdmiral: Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
[08:38] <HumanPrototype> Jimbo, they are the manuals for most software on linux - mainly console based tho
[08:38] <DJAdmiral> thunderstorm: lol
[08:38] <thunderstorm> I installed beryl as my window manager
[08:38] <thunderstorm> it makes other ppl wanna install linux too :)

[08:38] <gharz> guys... anybody here's who's using a sony digi cam W-series? ubuntu doesn't detect the memory card...
[08:38] <Ignite_> HumanPrototype: check out yelp, iirc it's a GUI access to man pages.
[08:38] <DJAdmiral> roryy: sorry - it's late and I'm sleepy :P
[08:38] <hoehaver> that may work...im not sure.
[08:39] <dope12345> any suggestings?

[08:39] <LinuxHelp> qemu looks good yeah
[08:40] <hoehaver> it has alot of....off things in it
[08:40] <hoehaver> like stuff for kubuntu..
[08:40] <roryy> hoehaver: do you really want all those repos?
[08:40] <hoehaver> no. bc i cant update.
[08:40] <hoehaver> i keep getting errors saying like...redundancy something or another...
[08:40] <roryy> hoehaver: the 'official' repos end at line 27
[08:40] <DJAdmiral> LinuxHelp: VMWare Player and VMWare Workstation are free.
[08:41] <hoehaver> and can not lock ...something
[08:41] <Jimbo> Ignite or anyone: heres what i installed. its a simple newsreader with a gui. http://pan.rebelbase.com/download/ I just need to know if after compiling do I need to save anything but the package installer (pan_0.119-1_i386.deb)
[08:41] <hoehaver> o...ok
[08:41] <hoehaver> so everything before line 27 i keep?
[08:41] <roryy> hoehaver: hrm.  Make sure you're not running synaptic
[08:41] <fooshang> For Xchat, How do you see all members of the channel? Dont see it in the settings anywhere.
[08:41] <DJAdmiral> Guys, I'm off
[08:41] <roryy> hoehaver: also, make sure you *are* using sudo (i'm assuming you're doing all this from the command line)
[08:41] <DJAdmiral> See ya Ignite!
[08:41] <Jimbo> the original tar.gz file I downloaded was only 1.9 mb and the destination folder is now 114 mb after compiling
[08:42] <hoehaver> yes
[08:42] <DJAdmiral> And LinuxHelp - lighten up a little!
[08:42] <hoehaver> ive tried synaptic
[08:42] <hoehaver> it mest up
[08:42] <DJAdmiral> Ciao everyone!
[08:42] <hoehaver> so i used sudo apt-get update
[08:42] <hoehaver> and upgrade
[08:42] <hoehaver> and it still messes up
[08:42] <Jimbo> The install package  (pan_0.119-1_i386.deb) is only 900+kb
[08:42] <roryy> hoehaver: the 'unable to get lock' message is (probably) unrelated to your sources.list
[08:42] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: everything seems to work. thank you very much for your help.
[08:43] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, np
[08:43] <hoehaver> hm
[08:43] <roryy> hoehaver: can you put the output of 'sudo apt-get update' on the pastebin too, if you haven't already?
[08:43] <Jimbo> I just need to know how much of the mess to send to someone else that wants the beta version of this newsreader
[08:43] <LinuxHelp> Akuma_, maybe I'll ask you how to setup my samba server one day ;)
[08:44] <hoehaver> ok just a sec
[08:44] <deema_> how can I check if something is compiled in my kernel?
[08:44] <jmx> whats sort of format would I pic if I were trying o listen to music on dogpile.com?
[08:44] <Akuma_> LinuxHelp: hopefully by then i'll know enough about linux/samba to help you do just that =)
[08:44] <Ignite_> Jimbo: have you checked for a ubuntu package? It would be much cleaner.
[08:44] <Ignite_> Jimbo: what's it called?
[08:45] <Jimbo> Ignite...the ubuntu package doesnt support nzb. I already compiled and installed the beta version of it and it works fine
[08:45] <Seyen> Ok. Hard-restarted.
[08:45] <Seyen> The drivers kinda seem installed.
[08:45] <Jimbo> Ignite: hold on ill get link again
[08:45] <Seyen> But I still don't have the option for higher res than 1024x768
[08:45] <thingy> deema_: What is the "something" ?
[08:45] <HumanPrototype> can automaitx2 install the nvidia drivers and get beryl working on x86 edgy?
[08:46] <Ignite_> Jimbo: just give your friend the link to what you downloaded, and I wouldn't bother with the link I'm stuck in the CLI.
[08:46] <hoehaver> its stuck at 99%....hold on..
[08:46] <roryy> !automatix | HumanPrototype
[08:46] <ubotu> HumanPrototype: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[08:46] <thingy> deema_: In essence you need to less /boot/config-* and see if the kernel option for the "something" is uncommented.
[08:46] <Jimbo> Ignite: its a pain to compile it and such. I was hoping to save themsome trouble
=== thunderstorm is now known as donderwolk
[08:46] <Jimbo> Ignite: heres that link  http://pan.rebelbase.com/
[08:47] <Ignite_> Jimbo: Oh I see, and that link is of no use to me. :P
[08:47] <hoehaver> http://pastebin.com/826869
[08:47] <hoehaver> there it is
[08:47] <Jimbo> Its only been 5 days since i first looked at linux
[08:47] <HumanPrototype> roryy, ok, sorry ill rephrase my question. does automatix2 claim to be able to install nvidia drivers and beryl and has anybody had success with it
[08:47] <dope1233> i'm using ndiswrapper now and i add the blacklist line for the bcm43xx but now my wireless network adapter doesn't show up in the networking window
[08:47] <dope1233> any suggestings?
[08:47] <Jimbo> I thought it would be a simple question
[08:47] <edoardo> hi everyone! : D
[08:47] <LinuxHelp> Jimbo, you'll start dreaming about penguins soon, dont you worry
[08:47] <donderwolk> Yoric: I like beryl too
[08:48] <hoehaver> im going to go ahead and delete everything in my source list after line 27
[08:48] <HumanPrototype> roryy, or - if u prefer - does ubuntu provide any official docs on gettting it to work?
[08:48] <dope1233> i'm using ndiswrapper now and i add the blacklist line for the bcm43xx but now my wireless network adapter doesn't show up in the networking window

[08:49] <edoardo> you guys, i've got an issue. i'm new to ubuntu. i'm a gentoo user. i wanna know two things. one, why do nfs mounted partition in fstab not get mounted at boot? i start portmap at boot, but not nfs-common. how do i start that? furthermore, why does my computer take more than one minute of pause after the disk checks? help! : D
[08:49] <HumanPrototype> roryy, thanks - ddnt realise #ubuntu-xgl was there
[08:49] <roryy> HumanPrototype: either ask these guys who are bragging about it, or ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[08:49] <Jimbo> so, when you compile an app you get an install package: would this statement be generally correct for most instances?
[08:49] <MinceR> hi
[08:49] <dope1233> i'm using ndiswrapper now and when i add the line "blacklist bcm43xx" to the /etc/network/interfaces file i can't see my wireless network card in the networking window
[08:49] <fooshang> First time using Xchat. Where is my user list? Cant see who is in the channel.
[08:49] <Jimbo> If so does that install package generally contain everything needed to install a app on another computer/
[08:49] <deema_> why blacklist?
[08:49] <dope1233> cause that's what all these howtos say to do
[08:50] <ofek> the suer list is on the right just move it a bit
[08:50] <dope1233> so it doesn't use the default wireless driver
[08:50] <deema_> why not?
[08:50] <Ignite_> Jimbo: no, if you compile something on your machine in the general format it runs a configure script and prepares it for your specific machine.
[08:50] <dope1233> cause it doesn't work
[08:50] <deema_> well
[08:50] <deema_> I have a driver I used yesterday
[08:50] <dope1233> maybe i need a different wireless driver
[08:50] <MinceR> when upgrading a server to edgy by the guide in the wiki, do i need to take the part about needing to have the *-desktop package installed seriously? what breakage can i expect because of not being to use update-manager?
[08:50] <dope1233> it works?
[08:50] <someperson> i have the same problem as dope
[08:50] <deema_> yep, I installed it, and the card worked instantly
[08:50] <dope1233> .inf and .sys fie?
[08:50] <Jimbo> When you compile an app you get an install package: would this statement be generally correct for most instances?  If so does that install package generally contain everything needed to install a app on another computer/
[08:50] <deema_> .deb
[08:50] <dope1233> oh a deb
[08:50] <deema_> no ndiswrapper
[08:50] <dope1233> bcm43xx-fwcutter?
[08:50] <edoardo> you guys? neeone?
[08:50] <deema_> hm
[08:51] <someperson> huh.
[08:51] <fooshang> Ok..Im a dumbass. Thanks for helping me find it.
[08:51] <roryy> MinceR: I don't know the answer to the -desktop package, but I can tell you I upgraded using 'aptitude dist-upgrade' successfully
[08:51] <Ignite_> Jimbo: I just answered that question.
[08:51] <dope1233> i don't think the driver i'm using works
[08:51] <hoehaver> roryy did you see where i pasted it?
[08:51] <someperson> where is my mouse!!
[08:51] <Ignite_> It's not magically going to become different if you ask again..
[08:51] <ofek> ^^
[08:51] <Jimbo> Ignite: I must have missed the answer
[08:51] <roryy> hoehaver: oh, sorry, i meant to respond
[08:51] <donderwolk> I only needed to install the gnome-network-manager to get my wireless to work correctly (with wpa)
[08:51] <Ignite_> Jimbo: no, if you compile something on your machine in the general format it runs a configure script and prepares it for your specific machine.
[08:51] <deema_> no now fwcutter
[08:51] <deema_> Broadcom 43xx Firmware
[08:51] <hoehaver> its cool. take your time man
[08:51] <MinceR> how much help does aptitude provide for that? do i still need to edit sources.list et al. like with apt-get?
[08:52] <deema_> or maybe it is
[08:52] <dope1233> :/
[08:52] <hoehaver> even after i deleted all the lines after line 27 i still got errors...
[08:52] <deema_> go to synaptic
[08:52] <Jimbo> Ignite: i ran the configure script, make , and checkinstall.
[08:52] <roryy> hoehaver: ah? Please put those on the pastebin
[08:52] <deema_> and search for: bcm43xx
[08:52] <dope1233> i can't get to synaptic cause wireless doesn't work on it
[08:52] <dope1233> i tried to use bcm43xx-fwcutter
[08:52] <deema_> ok 1 sec
[08:52] <dope1233> i think i just need a better driver
[08:52] <dope1233> cause my current one doesn't seem to be working
[08:53] <Jimbo> Ignite: Are you saying I cant take the package to another computer and just run checkinstall and install without re compiling?
[08:53] <dope1233> when i first install ubuntu i was able to setup my wireless with bcm43xx-fwcutter and everything was fun
[08:53] <donderwolk> bye
[08:53] <dope1233> but i was in a hotel and installed the latest updates or whatever and now the wireless doesn't connect but i can still see the networks
[08:53] <Jimbo> I guess checkinstall =make install
[08:54] <deema_> hm I don't know
[08:54] <deema_> you can try http://apt.ubuntu.org.tw/ubtw/bcm43xx-firmware/bcm43xx-firmware_1.1-0ubuntu1_all.deb
[08:54] <dope1233> is that just the bcm43xx-fwcutter
[08:55] <Ignite_> Strange, my head feels incredibly heavy...
[08:55] <Jimbo> The reason Im wondering is because I had to install a bunch of other stuff on ubuntu to make this machine even capable of compiling it
[08:55] <deema_> not sure
[08:55] <dope1233> what is that exactly?
[08:55] <dope1233> heh
[08:55] <deema_> I dunno
[08:55] <deema_> worked for me
[08:55] <dope1233> well i guess i'll give it a go anyway
[08:55] <dope1233> should i uninstall my current driver?

[08:55] <dope1233> how do i uninstall a driver i installed with bcm43xx-fwcutter?
[08:56] <deema_> i dunno
[08:56] <someperson> uninstall fwcutter, iguess
[08:56] <Borja> Why do people of ubuntu enter directly to this channel?
[08:56] <lucu> \serverlist
[08:56] <someperson> they do?
[08:56] <deema_> where should they?
[08:56] <jmx> were ubunties
[08:56] <dope1233> hmm
[08:56] <roryy> hoehaver: hrm
[08:57] <LjL> Borja: because it's preset in the IRC client that comes shipped with Ubuntu. you can remove it.
[08:57] <someperson> I'm on Mepis, trying to 'buntu
[08:57] <jmx> anyone wanna help me figure out some flash player problem.
[08:57] <roryy> hoehaver: try running apt-get update a few times
[08:58] <hoehaver> i will
[08:58] <Borja> Since it might speak with the manager of ubuntu?
[08:58] <jmx> you will?
[08:58] <LjL> Borja: what?
[08:58] <hoehaver> um...i will run sudo apt-get update a few times
[08:58] <jmx> ok
[08:59] <someperson> i hate broadcom!!
[08:59] <deema_> ya
[08:59] <denki> everybody does
[08:59] <someperson> my BCM4311 is ...
[08:59] <Borja> How might it speak with the administrator of ubuntu?
[08:59] <roryy> hoehaver: if that doesn't work, let me know
[08:59] <hoehaver> roryy same result every time
[08:59] <LjL> Borja: the operators of the #ubuntu channel you mean?
[09:00] <LjL> and with "it" do you mean "i"?
[09:00] <roryy> hoehaver: ok, we can try removing a file and see if that helps
[09:00] <denki> it gets the hose again.
[09:00] <LjL> Borja, in other words, what the heck are you talking about?
[09:00] <Flats> Wow is Xsane one of the better scanning packages available? Seems pretty easy to use
[09:00] <roryy> hoehaver: cd /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/
[09:00] <roryy> hoehaver: now run 'ls' -- is anything listed ?
[09:00] <Borja> no, i want to speak with the administrator of the program ubuntu in general..
[09:01] <LjL> Borja: there is no one single "administrator". there is a lot of people involved.
[09:01] <Flats> Borja: let me know how that goes
[09:01] <Seveas> Borja, there is no such person -- for which purpose do you need to speak with someone?
[09:01] <hoehaver> archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_dapper_main_binary-i386_Packages
[09:01] <birdfish> Because Ubuntu is open sourced, I would be able to use the Ubuntu graphic on my website without licensing issues, right?
[09:01] <steveire> Hey. My camera appears to be unsupported. dmesg should show some messages when I plug it in to the usb port, right? lsusb also shows only my mouse, and not the camera.
[09:01] <Seveas> birdfish, no
[09:01] <roryy> hoehaver: ok, lets remove that file
[09:01] <Seyen> Ok, how do I change the resolution, the not-easy-way-that-lets-me-set-it-to-1280x1024?
[09:01] <Seveas> birdfish, there are trademark rules
[09:01] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Seyen about fixres
[09:01] <roryy> hoehaver: 'sudo rm archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_dapper_main_binary-i386_Packages'
[09:02] <alecjw> hi
[09:02] <Ignite_> birdfish: that's a matter of trademarks, not software.
[09:02] <roryy> hoehaver: then run 'sudo apt-get update' again
[09:02] <alecjw> oops. soz. wrong window
[09:02] <melot> hi anyone help with my 20.5 G ibm destar HDD, the system seem to detect 2G only
[09:02] <erUSUL> birdfish: ubuntu is opensource but logos graphixs and other resources may have other licenses. check it
[09:02] <Borja> I want to speak with the administrator of the program ubuntu!
[09:02] <LjL> Borja: and i'm telling you there is no such person.
[09:02] <birdfish> Seveas Ignite erUSUL: thanks :)  I'll look into it!
[09:02] <Borja> with the administrator of the program, not with that of the channel!
[09:02] <Seyen> Looks like the bot can't help me either.. Sigh -_-
[09:02] <LjL> Borja: no. such. person.
[09:02] <Seveas> Borja, there is no such person -- for which purpose do you need to speak with someone?
[09:02] <someperson> there is probabl no one person
[09:02] <someperson> lol
[09:03] <Seveas> Seyen, the bot will respond in a minute, it has some lag
[09:03] <deema_> I'm the administrator, you can talk to me
[09:03] <Seyen> ...Newb overload))
[09:03] <deema_> :)
[09:03] <alecjw> Borja: why?
[09:03] <Borja> there is no such person -- for which purpose do you need to speak with someone?
[09:03] <steveire> I also tried it in the other usb ports, and other devices leave dmesg messages. Any ideas?
[09:03] <Ignite_> Borja: the guy that founded ubuntu is Mark Shuttleworth, but if you have a complaint it's better off elsewhere...
[09:03] <Borja> There has to be a presented manager of handling the program..
[09:03] <hoehaver> roryy it worked :)
[09:03] <hoehaver> no errors
[09:03] <roryy> hoehaver: great
[09:03] <hoehaver> thank you.
[09:03] <Seveas> Borja, there is no such thing as 'the program'
[09:03] <deema_> Mike Shuttleworth I guess...
[09:03] <LjL> deema_: Mark even
[09:03] <kmaynard> mark
[09:04] <roryy> hoehaver: that's happened to me once or twice, but not for quite a while
[09:04] <Seveas> we have  arelease manager, pr people, a ceo, various other responsible persons
[09:04] <deema_> oh
[09:04] <deema_> haha
[09:04] <someperson> deema_: i am having trouble getting my bcm4311 working
[09:04] <hoehaver> what exactly was the problem?
[09:04] <deema_> oh?
[09:04] <melot> anyone here help me with my hard disk problem?
[09:04] <Seveas> Borja, if you tell us what you need 'the manager'for, we can tell you who you need
[09:04] <someperson> can you help?
[09:04] <Ignite_> !ubuntu man
[09:04] <deema_> http://apt.ubuntu.org.tw/ubtw/bcm43xx-firmware/bcm43xx-firmware_1.1-0ubuntu1_all.deb
[09:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntu man - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:04] <deema_> try this
[09:04] <Borja> all stupids..
[09:04] <Ignite_> >_>
[09:04] <someperson> i have that
[09:04] <deema_> I don't know then
[09:04] <someperson> hmm
[09:05] <roryy> hoehaver: i don't know. apt-get gets its knickers in a knot sometimes; no idea why
[09:05] <hoehaver> o ok.
[09:05] <hoehaver> but thank you all the same
[09:06] <alecjw> wtf was borja talking about? he/she wanted to speak to mark becuase she doesnt like xchat automatically logging her into #ubuntu?
[09:06] <someperson> i also have bcm43xx-fwcutter
[09:06] <Seveas> %rss announce ubuntusecurity
[09:06] <ubotu> OK
[09:06] <someperson> will that affect it?
[09:07] <someperson> lol
[09:08] <LjL> alecjw: or something
[09:09] <Ignite_> O.o
[09:09] <Utopiate> So I have 72% of system RAM in use for cache? Would cleaning out the cache bring that down and how would I do that?
[09:09] <LjL> Utopiate, the RAM that is used for caching is freed automatically when programs require it. you don't need to worry about it.
[09:10] <deema_> true that
[09:10] <Utopiate> I thought so but my system monitors always make me antsy to "tune" the system
[09:10] <LjL> resist the temptation
[09:10] <Utopiate> beryl has been running great though... i got it all tweaked out using the nvidia beta drivers... very nice...
[09:10] <alecjw> LjL: i hate people like that, don't you? they seem to think that, becuase this is a commuinity run project, mark has the time and energy to listen to their whinges about program config. in windoze, you wouldn't comalun to bill because you think that IE's defualt homepages should be googloe.com, woild you?
[09:11] <Utopiate> I might
[09:11] <LjL> alecjw, he was just clueless.
[09:12] <draeath> is it possible to mount a USB drive without cache?
[09:12] <alecjw> draeath: i think ubuntu does that by defualt
[09:13] <psusi> draeath: yes, but it is a bad idea
[09:13] <psusi> makes access to it horribly slow, and wears out the flash quickly
[09:13] <draeath> not in this case
[09:13] <draeath> i want 'cp' to take a horribly long time, because if i copy over a file to my Sansa, i want to know when it's really done
[09:13] <iter> nice
[09:13] <psusi> some people have reportedly ruined their flash drives in a few days by doing that
[09:13] <patrick_king> !lamp
[09:13] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[09:13] <iter> Buffer I/O error on device hda1, logical block xx
[09:13] <iter> :\
[09:14] <draeath> this isn't a flash drive, only thing that happens is mp3s on, mp3s off
[09:14] <alecjw> draeath: either psusi or i must be wrong.l it's probbly me. iognore me
[09:14] <trappist> draeath: I just manually umount the device, which (in my experience) won't complete until the write is really done
[09:14] <psusi> draeath: why do you want to know when it is done?  and it takes a lot longer to copy it than it actually takes to copy it with cache enabled
[09:14] <psusi> draeath: because it hammers the shit out of the fat
[09:14] <deema_> FATAL: Module firmware_class not found. FATAL: Module relayfs not found. FATAL: Module crc32 not found...   What do I do ???
[09:15] <psusi> aye.... always unmount before yuo unplug
[09:15] <mnepton> awwww .... i missed Borja
[09:16] <draeath> psusi, really?
[09:16] <alecjw> mnepton: me too. it feels awful, doesn't it? i wanted to yell at him/her
[09:16] <psusi> there was a patch proposed to add a flush mount option that still allowed caching, but flushed it when the file was closed... but for some reason it never got merged into the kernel
[09:16] <abo> to install jboss in ubuntu.. I just download it and extract it to the local disk?
[09:16] <dope12345> ok that didn't work either
[09:16] <psusi> I posted to the lkml the other day asking what ever happened to it
[09:16] <draeath> psusi, ok, so how can i see the status of the copy operation?
[09:16] <dope12345> same problem. i can see wireless networks and it tries to connect but it won't connect
[09:16] <mc44> mnepton: I hope you have enough tarantulas for the rest of the class
[09:16] <iamjwc> Does anyone have a reference for dual booting windows and ubuntu from seperate harddrives?
[09:16] <psusi> draeath: do you really care?  or do you just want to know when it is safe to unplug?
[09:16] <Seveas> mnepton, !
[09:16] <mnepton> alecjw: the CoC sorta discourages that. but a quiet moment of schadenfreude is fine. ;)
[09:16] <draeath> psusi, yes
[09:17] <draeath> psusi, both
[09:17] <Seveas> mnepton, how's allhands?
[09:17] <mc44> mnepton: broken any flaming boards recently?
[09:17] <mnepton> Seveas: pretty good. we had this *weird* team building session on Monday. it was ... surreal.
[09:17] <iamjwc> Does anyone have a reference for dual booting windows and ubuntu from seperate harddrives?
[09:17] <alecjw> mnepton: i dodn't mean it literally. i meant as in explain to him/her that if he/she finds a problem with a program, she should report a bug and not compain to mark
[09:17] <mnepton> mc44: i bailed on that part of the program.
[09:17] <Seveas> mnepton, hmmm, *YOU* say of something that it's weird.... Then it must be really weird!
[09:18] <Ignite_> iamjwc: it's just like doing it from one HDD.
[09:18] <mnepton> Seveas: i love you, too ;)
[09:18] <Ignite_> iamjwc: just make sure you install windows first.
[09:18] <mc44> mnepton: damn right too. Im supreised Mark went in for all that, but what do i know :)
[09:18] <Seveas> mnepton, *kiss*
[09:18] <mnepton> mc44: wasn't his call.
[09:18] <psusi> draeath: you should always unmount before you unplug... when the unmount finishes it is safe to unplug... in fact, I think you get a nice little progress bar these days
[09:18] <iamjwc> ignite_ alright, cool
[09:18] <iamjwc> thanks
[09:18] <mc44> mnepton: ah well that explains alot
[09:18] <deema_> FATAL: Module firmware_class not found. FATAL: Module relayfs not found. FATAL: Module crc32 not found...   What do I do ???
[09:18] <someperson> im back. i uninstalled fwcutter, but it still doesn't work
[09:19] <draeath> psusi, nope, not in xubuntu
[09:19] <draeath> psusi, i'm not touching GNOME and kde is a little heavy for this mentally-challenged laptop :)
[09:19] <mnepton> yesterday's quote du jour: <jono>: I've always found Linspire to be the Linux equivalent of the <blink> tag.
[09:19] <Ignite_> mentally?
[09:19] <Ignite_> Lol.
[09:20] <Seveas> mnepton, MUHA
[09:20] <thingy> deema_: i know that relayfs and crc32 are compiled as modules in the standard edgy kernel...so did you try modprobe relayfs and modprobe crc32 before you try to load the module you want?
[09:20] <mnepton> classic.
[09:20] <someperson> how do i add a git to my kernel?
[09:20] <someperson> nm
[09:20] <deema_> thingy, I tried: modprobe crc32
[09:20] <deema_> module not found
[09:20] <someperson> how do i get kernel 2.18?
[09:20] <mnepton> <SUDO_Tux> Does anyone know how to get America's Army 2.3 to work?
[09:20] <mnepton> <mneptok> SUDO_Tux: sudo apt-get remove rumsfeld
[09:21] <thingy> deema_: are you using a custom kernel?
[09:21] <mc44> mnepton: this is the Jono who is on the freespire board? :)
[09:21] <deema_> no
[09:21] <deema_> ubuntu edgy
[09:21] <thingy> deema_: uname -a please
[09:21] <deema_> default
[09:21] <Seveas> mnepton, they already did that last week ;)
[09:21] <draeath> arg! this paticular song refuses to be read properly by my Sansa. It can't find the 'album' field for it or somethiing

[09:21] <ubotu> someperson: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[09:21] <mnepton> mc44: this is the Jono that is the Ubuntu Community Director for Canonical. so ... no. ;)
[09:21] <someperson> lol
[09:21] <mc44> mnepton: well he ws...
[09:21] <mc44> *was
[09:22] <mnepton> mc44: he put down the crack pipe and is now much, much better.
[09:22] <psusi> draeath: ahh, in that case umount it from the command line then
[09:22] <Seveas> mnepton, for a certain definition of better (need I say more than "bottle dance")
[09:22] <psusi> draeath: so in xubuntu when you unmount it from the desktop, it still removes the icon immediately?
[09:22] <mc44> mnepton: I doubt he put it down, but its good to know its slightly less strong crack now :)
[09:22] <psusi> draeath: even if it is still flushing buffers
[09:22] <draeath> psusi, the icons are always on the desktop, mounted or not
[09:22] <mnepton> Seveas: great. now i need more psychotherapy.
[09:23] <Seveas> mnepton, won't help
[09:23] <psusi> draeath: there was a bug in ubuntu a while back with that that got fixed... might need refiled against xubuntu
[09:23] <icc> How do I find my irda device on my laptop? can't find it under lsusb :-)
[09:23] <thingy> deema_: modprobe crc32c
[09:23] <mnepton> Seveas: lobotomy?
[09:23] <Seveas> only works if you have at last half a brain
[09:23] <Ignite_> Yay, that's KDE entirely removed. :-D *dances like Nepoleon Dynamite*
[09:23] <mnepton> Seveas: i have half a brain. sadly, it's all the unconcious autonomic systems. :/
[09:25] <icc> should irda device be present under Network Settings?
[09:26] <mc44> Seveas: I think the community has a right to see pictures of said bottle dance, Im sure psychologically damaging everyone will bring us closer together
[09:26] <Ignite_> Bottle dance eh?
[09:26] <Ignite_> Tell me more. :D
[09:27] <fryfrog> does anyone know why the lines "install /bin/setserial /dev/ttyS0 uart none ; /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install lirc_serial;" when placed in /etc/modprobe.d/lirc_serial is not being read?
[09:27] <fryfrog> if i do "sudo modprobe -c | grep lirc" it *sees* those lines
[09:27] <fryfrog> but it doesn't seem to be executing it :/
[09:28] <alecjw> oops, soory
[09:28] <mc44> Ignite_: the bottle dance is a secret best kept to those who went to uds-mtv i fear
[09:28] <Ignite_> Awww. :(

[09:29] <CientificoLoco> Hello, how do I convert wma file to mp3 file
[09:29] <draeath> hmm lets see if moving all the tags from id3v1 to id3v2, and stripping id3v1 will get it to work
[09:29] <CientificoLoco> LjL, hello
[09:29] <Ignite_> CientificoLoco: you don't, you will just lose quality, but if you want to then I'm sure there is a program that can help you. :-)
[09:29] <CientificoLoco> Ignite_, do you know this program??
[09:29] <eplus> evening all
[09:30] <eplus> how can you reset the keyboard shortcuts back to default?
[09:30] <Seveas> mc44, pictures are on the planet
[09:30] <CientificoLoco> Ignite_, do you know how my Amarok could play this files!?
[09:31] <mc44> Seveas: hmm I though there was deliberate restraint from posting this bottle dance, perhaps I just missed it (probably for the best)  :)
[09:31] <Ignite_> CientificoLoco: play wma files you mean?
[09:31] <Ignite_> CientificoLoco: yes.
[09:32] <CientificoLoco> Ignite_, yeah

[09:32] <Axsuul> In the gnome-power-manager, i don't have a screen brightness adjustment slider, is this normal?
[09:33] <Ignite_> Axsuul: brightness settings are usually located on the monitor itself.
[09:33] <pianoboy3333> How can I check what programs may be using oss?
[09:34] <Axsuul> ignite_: hmm yea they don't work, do i need certain drivers or something
[09:34] <SurfnKid> um
[09:34] <skreet> I've been googling to n oavail, any solution for 'soft lockup on CPU#0' problems
[09:34] <Ignite_> Axsuul: I'm sure there is a way to configure your display for that, although I don't know how myself, I've never needed to. :P
[09:34] <m4rk> hi how do I stop the screen from going to sleep when I am watching stuff on MPlayer?
[09:34] <Axsuul> Ignite_: alright, thakns
[09:35] <SurfnKid> how can i configure Galeon Browser to open RTSP links that FF can open? do I configure Galeon with the rtsp handler config in 'about:config' ?

[09:36] <edoardo> hi everyone! : D
[09:37] <alecjw> The_Russ: general chat should be in #ubuntuforums, #ubuntu is for support
[09:37] <skreet> Ignite_: Is that the icon that resolves my CPU#0 issue?
[09:37] <link> <thingy> thank you very much, its working perfectly!! ;)
[09:37] <The_Russ> it is sort of a support issue :-/
[09:37] <edoardo> you guys, a quickie. how do i start nfs-common at boot? thanks!

[09:48] <jhaquo> im looking for a program/feature that would shutdown the computer after X hours automaticaly, does that exist?
[09:48] <CarlFK> jhaquo: the shutdown command :)
[09:48] <foxure> jhaquo, you could just use the shutdown command i think
[09:48] <name_> sleep xh && shutdown
[09:48] <jhaquo> i wanna go to sleep with some music on, but i dont want the comp to stay on all night :D
[09:48] <foxure> jhaquo, man shutdown or shutdown -h will help i think
[09:49] <CarlFK> jhaquo: why not leave it on all night?
[09:49] <cappu> or a cronjob which executes shutdown at your favourite time jhaquo
[09:49] <jhaquo> cause its on batery, and he will be pissed off
[09:49] <eplus> i am trying to reset the keyboard shortcuts back to default, any ideas?

[09:51] <lotuspsychje> hi all
[09:51] <izmaelis> CarlFK, but mplayer -vo jpeg creates jpeg file for every frame in video file. I need to make screenshot from paused movie scene. Is that possible?
[09:51] <jhaquo> hmmm its not mentioned in what measure is "TIME" :s
[09:51] <CarlFK> izmaelis: maybe.  it depends on how mp has accessed video memory, and if any scaling has taken place
[09:52] <lotuspsychje> i have a problem: after ifconfig eth0 up, my connection freezes any way to solve this without rebooting?
[09:52] <foxure> lotuspsychje, are the problem still there if you take the net cable of?
[09:52] <CarlFK> izmaelis: you cal tell mp to start at a time and play a number of frames (like 1) and make a jpg of each
[09:53] <jhaquo> my god, thats a hardcore shutdown, everything went black O_o
[09:53] <lotuspsychje> foxure you mean taking in and out eth0 cable?
[09:53] <kingdango> can someone help me with installing a new theme for ubuntu?
[09:53] <tannerld> how can remove the firefox totem plugin/
[09:53] <foxure> lotuspsychje, im me if you do ifconfig eth1 up while you not have the cable connected?
[09:53] <kingdango> i've been downloading stuff from gnome-look.org
[09:54] <Spenlex> you put it in your themes folder
[09:54] <kingdango> where is themes located?
[09:54] <lotuspsychje> foxure lol, no im always connected with my cable when i do up or down eth0
[09:54] <Spenlex> in /home/USERNAME/.themes
[09:54] <kingdango> thx
[09:54] <kingdango> let me try that
[09:55] <kingdango> i should extract it to that folder or leave it as an archive?
=== Daemon is now known as barryd
[09:55] <jhaquo> thx guys im off :)
[09:55] <Spenlex> extract
[09:55] <kingdango> k
[09:55] <foxure> lotuspsychje,yes ofcourse=). but i mean you should check and see whats happens if you do ifup eth1 when you cable is not connected. Then you maybe could see the problem more specifict
[09:55] <Spenlex> it works for GTK styles and metacity themes
[09:55] <Eludias> How can I 'upgrade' from server to desktop? Just do something like 'apt-get install desktop'?
[09:55] <barryd> lmao
[09:56] <lotuspsychje> foxure i din't know you could bring up eth0 while cable is off, and what other options will be displayed?
[09:56] <tritium> Eludias: yes, with by installing the ubuntu-desktop package.
[09:56] <barryd> Like any linux.. you dont just download a server or a desktop... the desktop is called a xserver, and the server... well, they are services that accept client connections....
[09:56] <Eludias> tritium: Thanks. Will try to install server then. desktop oopses...
[09:56] <Glombool> is there a way to set the timer resolution in ubuntu?  I want to set it to 1024, but it doesn't seem to take when I try.
[09:57] <lotuspsychje> foxure any config file i can check for eth0 stuff?
[09:57] <psusi> glombool: what do you mean?
[09:57] <Glombool> psusi I mean the processor timer resolution.
[09:57] <Daviey> Hi, does anybody here use nomachines NX server?
[09:58] <psusi> globalmatador: I believe you can choose whatever number you wish when you build the kernel
[09:58] <foxure> lotuspsychje, you can't but, the hardware network intefaces will wait for hardware connection... then the problem is something related to the cable or communication error
[09:58] <barryd> Daviey > what does it do?
[09:58] <psusi> err, glombool even
[09:58] <foxure> lotheac,  if it works will say
[09:58] <Daviey> barryd, remote login, like VNC but faster (over ssh)
[09:58] <barryd> nice
[09:58] <barryd> uber-nice with ssh
[09:58] <Eludias> How do I switch from X to desktop on a Mac?
[09:59] <Seveas> Eludias, go to a mac channel for that...
[09:59] <psusi> Eludias: "to desktop"?
[09:59] <malc_> I deleted /etc/apache2/* by mistake how can I reinstall apache2 and get the defualt conf files back?
[09:59] <Eludias> psusi: VT1 or so.
[09:59] <Daviey> barryd, only drawback - you don't SHARE a login with the physical user, you get a new desktop.  But over DSL it runs like your sat infront of it
[09:59] <foxure> lotuspsychje, if it doesn's work. it seems like an error with some driver or damaged hardware, or possibly a connector thats not connected 100%
[10:00] <Eludias> Seveas: Oh, sorry. This is the x86 channel only?
[10:00] <Seveas> malc_, apt-get remove --purge [all apache2 packages you installed] 
[10:00] <psusi> Eludias: oh, you mean to a terminal?
[10:00] <barryd> Awsome!! Well, all exsept for the fact that it doesnt use pam or atleast passwd
[10:00] <psusi> Eludias: ctrl-alt-F1
[10:00] <barryd> Whats the issue with it?
[10:00] <lotuspsychje> foxure:its all working fine, ip stays up, cables stays in,
[10:00] <Glombool> psusi perhaps I'm not saying it right...  The sytem timer resoltion.    I type sudo sysctl -w dev.rtc.max-user-freq=1024, but it doesn't seem to work.
[10:00] <lotuspsychje> just can find what's wrong
[10:00] <Seveas> malc_, then reinstall apache
[10:00] <Eludias> psusi: Yeah, but on this notebook F1 == FN + 1, and Alt is probably mapped to Option or so... Not sure. Weird mac keyboards...
[10:00] <malc_> Seveas: then just reinstall as normal. .... apt-get install apache2?
[10:00] <Seveas> yup
[10:00] <psusi> glombool: I don't think you can change that at runtime
[10:01] <psusi> glombool: that setting is compiled into the kernel
[10:01] <Glombool> psusi Crap.  So I need to compile my own :p
[10:01] <Daviey> barryd, it does use PAM
[10:01] <barryd> I was thinking Seveas was asking how do you recover the config files... answer, deleted, have recovering
[10:01] <barryd> oh, my mistake
[10:01] <barryd> I thought you said it doesnt share a pass with teh user
[10:01] <foxure> lotuspsychje, so, whats the problem now? is the eth1 working sometimes and sometime not?
[10:02] <lotuspsychje> foxure after 2 hours uptime i can connect internet anymore, still my cables are in and ip stays up
[10:02] <malc_> Seveas that hasn't worked I'm afraid
[10:02] <malc_> When I installed apache I only typed apt-get install apache2 and didn't select any other packages
[10:03] <malc_> could some packages have sneaked in some how?
[10:03] <Seveas> malc_, dpkg -l | grep apache | grep ^ii
[10:03] <Seveas> and remov'em all
[10:03] <barryd> like deps malc_?
=== michaels_ is now known as graulich
[10:03] <malc_> Seveas :  Uninstall all those packages?  They all look apache related

[10:25] <Flats> _3fg: you can install Opera right ftom the package manager
[10:25] <_3fg> I got Edgy 64bit because I have a 64-bit processor
[10:25] <_3fg> Flats: I am doing that
[10:25] <_3fg> it's generating the error
[10:25] <Arigato> what does kdesu do?
[10:26] <_3fg> oh, wait
[10:26] <_3fg> I read that wrong
[10:26] <Flats> _3fg: wonder if OPera doesn't support 64bit processing
[10:26] <Clin1> Im looking for something similar to SAM (special audio)
[10:26] <Doow> what's the install guide for beryl (edgy eft)
[10:26] <Jowi> Arigato, it gives you a graphical password promt for launching commands that require admin/su password
[10:27] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell doow about beryl
[10:27] <Jowi> Arigato, similar to gksu/gksudo
[10:27] <Arigato> what is the difference between gksudo and kdesu?
[10:27] <VigoSandy> Next Q? Does the Edgy have the Gpart ready made so I can part the HD and install, or do I downlowd the liveCD of gpart?
[10:27] <_3fg> Opera is not available in the package manager
[10:27] <Doow> LjL: I only find dapper or cvs stuff there =(
[10:27] <LjL> Arigato: one is used by Ubuntu (Gnome) and the other by Kubuntu (KDE)
[10:27] <Arigato> that makes sense

[10:27] <atlef> VigoSandy : it's there
[10:28] <_3fg> hm, is it because you have a different processor architecture?
[10:28] <Flats> _3fg: I just used it yesterday
[10:28] <VigoSandy> Thank you
[10:28] <LjL> Doow: read the #ubuntu-xgl channel topic.
[10:28] <Flats> ahhh that makes sense
[10:28] <fb2883> you really need to add more packegs to your distro

[10:35] <abarbaccia> _3fg, yes
[10:35] <_3fg> did you figure out the startup thing?
[10:35] <barryd_lunch> What happened to the days when you would ./configure, then make, then find out what the errors mean, and then make install
[10:35] <barryd_lunch> lol
[10:35] <LjL> barryd_lunch: ... it's still there?
[10:35] <Jowi> barryd_lunch, it has not been removed. but it's optional :)
[10:35] <barryd_lunch> ya, but, whats with these questions... rpm/apt-get/deb

[10:36] <abarbaccia> _3fg, not yet... trying to find another work around

[10:39] <Flats> Ok last question ( Just trying to see what features I can use in Linux that I use most in WinBlows ) . Is there a Linux app that acts like a cisco VPN client?
[10:39] <Beep> cisco vpn supports linux
[10:39] <nuts`> heh
[10:39] <Beep> you can get the client for linux.
[10:39] <nuts`> Flats: id rather use vpnc
[10:40] <nothlit> Can someone tell me what the difference between [[:print:] *]  and [[:print:] ] * in regex is?
[10:40] <barryd> Any arguments, mplayer is the best app for running any audio/video format known to man...
[10:40] <Flats> nuts`: VPNC will connect to a cisco VPN device
[10:40] <fb2883> ?? i use debian on all my computers and have never had any trubble with mp3's
[10:40] <nuts`> make a config file - do 'vpnc-connect configfile' and your done
[10:40] <aum> hi - is there any particular reason why standard ubuntu is stuck at kde3?
[10:40] <nothlit> barryd, vlc is pretty great too
[10:40] <mc44> fb2883: i think mp3 codecs arent exactly dfsg compliant
[10:40] <hikenboot> hello all I had a freeze up and now when I goto a console and as root or any user I get the following error xlib: connection to "0:0" refused by server xlib: invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key I have tried export DISPLAY=0:0 and then sudo or no sudo or kdesu some command and always the same thing..also have tried xhost +localhost but nothing works
[10:40] <nothlit> barryd, it has more codecs built in actually
[10:40] <Flats> nuts`: When you say configfile, Is that the PCF file from windows?
[10:41] <barryd> nice
[10:41] <fb2883> and i use one syetem just for a 24//7 mp3 player
[10:41] <barryd> lmao
[10:41] <barryd> thats actually an awsome idea!!!
[10:41] <lir1> fb2883: thats a waste of hardware :)
[10:41] <lir1> fb2883: get mythtv on it
[10:41] <nuts`> flats: kinda, well you write all the stuff in there - its easy
[10:41] <Beep> oo.. more I can learn in here.  nuts':  does vpnc support dongle security cisco VPN connections?  the RSA keyfob type
[10:41] <nuts`> hum dunno -.-
[10:42] <Flats> nuts`: do I need to dl or install anyhting?
=== brian__ is now known as hotshotesquire

[10:51] <jack> no i was syaing about myself
[10:51] <jack> i always do it
[10:51] <jmichaelx> Yoric: you would need the right repo enabled, then spt-get opera
[10:51] <jack> i'll shut up now ...

[10:52] <darkbuda> it gives: E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report.
[10:52] <jmichaelx> Yoric: i am not sure it is in the edgy repos, i think you have to go with the dapper-commercial repo from canonical.... may be wrong, but that is what i remember
[10:52] <Yoric> jmichaelx: that's what I'm attempting to do
[10:52] <Yoric> darkbuda: ok, my bad

[10:54] <hikenboot> is there a way to regenerate the MIT-MAGIC COOKIE?
[10:54] <Yoric> darkbuda: in a terminal, write         sudo apt-get -f install
[10:54] <k6rfm> Yoric https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser gives some seemingly complete instructions, but doesn't use Synaptic
[10:55] <Yoric> darkbuda: followed by                 sudo dpkg -a --configure
[10:55] <Yoric> that should do the trick of cleaning-up your internal cache, I think
[10:55] <Yoric> after that, follow k6rfm's advice
[10:55] <k6rfm> Yoric: oh, there it is further down.  have to use Opera's own repository
[10:55] <darkbuda> Yoric: working on that
[10:55] <DanSchnell> How do you add items to your desktop?
[10:55] <darkbuda> Yoric: still the same msg.... :(
[10:55] <bhudda> Anybody played with songbird much? I want to figure out how to get it to play .m4a files
[10:56] <nolimitsoya> Yoric, i dont see how that would touch the cache. sudo apt-get clean clears the cache.
[10:56] <rafaguap> as I'm there: any way to have working enhanced acpi of edgy, but keeping dapper? so that i hibernate is more rapid ?
[10:56] <Yoric> DanSchnell: typically, right-click on the desktop and choose "create launcher" or something similar.
[10:56] <Yoric> nolimitsoya: is that it ? I haven't used command-line apt-get in a long time.
[10:56] <nolimitsoya> Yoric, -f install just fixes aborted/broken installs
[10:56] <Yoric> darkbuda: then follow nolimitsoya's advice.
[10:56] <DanSchnell> I have a floppy in the floppy drive, how do I access it? (I am running Xubuntu 6.10)

[10:59] <Yoric> DanSchnell: maybe I don't understand your question, actually.
[11:00] <Yoric> What do you want to do ?
[11:00] <aum> anyone know when standard ubuntu will upgrade to kde4 progs?
[11:00] <Yoric> Access your floppy in the "file manager" ?
[11:00] <aum> konqueror etc is stuck at v3
[11:00] <Yoric> Or in a terminal ?
[11:00] <darkbuda> nolimitsoya: do u have the addr?
[11:00] <DanSchnell> Yoric, /bin /home /media ?  I am at the program launcher setup
[11:00] <nolimitsoya> darkbuda, no, sorry.
[11:00] <Yoric> DanSchnell: either way, the floppy should be one of the subdirectories of /media
[11:01] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, /media/floppy
[11:01] <Jowi> DanSchnell, the "whereis" command will tell you where an application is located. if you can not find an application in a menu, open a terminal and type in the name there. use "whereis appname" if if can not launch it for you automatically..
[11:01] <finalbeta> aum, I doubt anyone knows, I've seen several specs discussing it for feisty and feisty +1, but nothing solid I think.
[11:01] <Ignite_> aum, KDE4 is still under heavy development.
[11:01] <Yoric> Anyway, I'll have to go.
[11:01] <Yoric> Good night everyone.
[11:01] <Ignite_> Night
[11:01] <micktm> hi! someone uses KTechLab?
[11:01] <nolimitsoya> darkbuda, deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[11:01] <nette> okai, another question.. i got big probs with my mysql-server.. tried to do it from scratch from the ubuntu-edgy site.. but i just get access denied for root@localhost..
[11:02] <DanSchnell> Jowi, I just want to put a thunar icon on my desktop
[11:02] <nolimitsoya> darkbuda, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install
[11:02] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, then make a launcher, and give the command 'thunar'
[11:02] <DanSchnell> nolimitsoya, Thank you!
[11:03] <Jowi> DanSchnell, oh, i misunderstood you. gave you a complicated solution that you didn't need.
[11:03] <Jowi> sorry
[11:03] <cimos> is it possible to upgrade from breezy to edgy? (or must i first upgrade to dapper?)
[11:03] <nolimitsoya> !upgrade
[11:03] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:04] <nolimitsoya> cimos, short story: you need to do incremental upgrades
[11:04] <piggyg1> has anyone had any success with installing partimage?
[11:04] <cimos> nolimitsoya: what does "incremental" means? :)
[11:04] <deema> to dapper
[11:04] <bhudda> In increments, small bits at a time...
[11:04] <nolimitsoya> cimos, one step at a time. never skip versions, or you will break something
[11:05] <Jowi> cimos, breezy -> dapper -> edgy. but read the upgrade guides before you begin
[11:05] <DanSchnell> What is the command for Open Office?
[11:05] <jack> maybe thats what I did :) ?
[11:05] <cimos> nolimitsoya: ok thanks for your help
[11:05] <Jowi> DanSchnell, ooffice or oowriter
[11:05] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, openoffice
[11:06] <jack> jack@cubuntu:~$ -f install
[11:06] <jack> bash: -f: command not found
[11:06] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, neat, huh ;) always try the first thing that comes to mind. its usualy correct.
=== ryu2 is now known as ryu
[11:06] <jack> jack@cubuntu:~$ sudo -f install
[11:06] <jack> sudo: illegal option `-f'
[11:06] <jack> usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
[11:06] <rafaguap> ... and: how to  have openoffice 2.0.4 when you keep dapper?  ???
[11:06] <jack> ????
[11:07] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, the commands can be tried out by typing them in a terminal.

[11:09] <jdahm> Im wondering if there is some way if I have a 6.06 LiveCD, if I can boot from it and download the ISO for 6.10 and then mount it virtually and install it from there, instead of installing 6.06 and upgrading
[11:09] <jdahm> is that possible?
[11:09] <LjL> jdahm: no
[11:09] <nolimitsoya> jdahm, that would be ugly... dont
[11:09] <jdahm> nolimitsoya: the upgrade has been just as ugly many times
[11:10] <afief> Why does ubuntu fail to boot when i insert a new hard disk into the rig?
[11:10] <mc44> jdahm: you might as well download the CD, youd need to pull as much stuff off the internet anyway
[11:10] <[Relic] > have 2 cd rws and just download and burn the new iso?
[11:10] <nolimitsoya> jdahm, just write a new cd instead
[11:10] <LjL> jdahm: can't you just burn a 6.10 CD?
[11:10] <seele_> please help when I logon into gnome session my system hangs
[11:10] <jdahm> but that wastes a CD
[11:10] <seele_> how can I solve this
[11:10] <nolimitsoya> afief, you need to check you fstab, i guess
[11:10] <seele_> is a fresh installation
[11:10] <LjL> jdahm: then use a rewritable :)
[11:11] <afief> nolimitsoya: it's a fresh installation of edgy, and the new way they handle the fstab naming i wouldn't understand it
[11:11] <dromer> aarg, I downloaded a rar-archive af the new Southpark episode, but I forgot how to unpack those :/
[11:11] <dromer> anyone? :#
[11:11] <Zarephath> Anyone know about this? apt-cache search isn't finding it... checking for PIXBUF... configure: error: Package requirements (gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.1.2) were not met:
[11:11] <Jowi> jdahm, why not use dist-upgrade?
[11:11] <LjL> dromer, we aren't concerned with helping you do illegal things here
[11:11] <p_masho> is it possible to do a reverse lookup with ubuntu to dinf out who has a subnet ? eg 213.171.218.* bit like reverse lookup or something ?
[11:11] <piggyg1> dromer: just click on it
[11:11] <seele_> please help!
[11:11] <ameyer> jdahm: or install 6.06, download the iso, mount it, and use synaptic to use the "CD" to get the upgraded packages
[11:11] <afief> nolimitsoya: also when i check runlevel one it turns out it hangs at "starting up" instead of the filesystem stuff
[11:11] <nolimitsoya> afief, uuid is a hash unique to every partition, meaniung you can swap drives how ever you wish, adn things wuold still work
[11:12] <LjL> ameyer: that won't change the fact that it's an upgrade
[11:12] <dromer> piggyg1: ne-uhh it's in multiple archives
[11:12] <afief> nolimitsoya: wouldn't that mean that it SHOULD work?
[11:12] <rafaguap> is it possible to downgrade from edgy to dapper? how?
[11:12] <Spee_Der> Good evening everyone, I'm glad to see you all here.....
[11:12] <LjL> !downgrade | rafaguap
[11:12] <ubotu> rafaguap: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[11:12] <nolimitsoya> afief, yes :P
[11:12] <piggyg1> dromer: hang on lets see what 7zip has to say
[11:12] <bimberi> jdahm: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation has various methods.  I didn't see you request specificially but you might be able to adapt this one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromHardDriveWithFloppies
[11:12] <afief> nolimitsoya: i guess that's theoretically only:D
[11:12] <rafaguap> thanks ubotu
[11:12] <ameyer> well, if it's a fresh install it shouldn't be that bad
[11:12] <Jowi> jdahm, install 6.06 then dist-upgrade to 6.10. easier no?
[11:12] <bimberi> *yout
[11:12] <bimberi> *your (argh)
[11:13] <nolimitsoya> afief, just try writing a fstab like you would in "the old days" :)
[11:14] <afief> nolimitsoya: i never did, never tried, i could only understand what's written there back then
[11:14] <afief> nolimitsoya: I tried to do it in dapper earlier this evening but it still didn't work
[11:15] <piggyg1> dromer: have you tried using wine and launching winrar?
[11:15] <hikenboot> hello all---is edgy no longer dependant on the ubuntu-desktop meta package?
=== atlas95 is now known as Atlas_Zzz
[11:16] <mc44> hikenboot: what do you mean by dependent?
[11:16] <dromer> er .. ofcourse not ;/
[11:16] <Zarephath> !pastebin
[11:16] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:16] <dromer> I don't think I have wine ..
[11:16] <hikenboot> I am trying to remove and reinstall gnome because of MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE errors...
[11:16] <finalbeta> hikenboot, as far as I know, nothing has changed, it's still a mess.
[11:16] <piggyg1> dromer: you can get it really easily through the add/remove
[11:16] <dromer> ok
[11:16] <piggyg1> dromer: I'm going to try winrar right now with wine to see if it works
[11:17] <finalbeta> piggyg1, let us know if it works.
[11:17] <dromer> ok .. I'll try too ..
[11:17] <Zarephath> someone look at this and explain how I change the variables? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32415/
[11:17] <nolimitsoya> piggyg1, sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
[11:17] <nolimitsoya> piggyg1, use that instead
[11:17] <hikenboot> anyone know how to remove gnome...gnome-desktop-environment package isnt installed according to this neither is ubuntu-desktop package
[11:17] <dromer> but I think it should be alot easier :P
[11:17] <dromer> nolimitsoya: that for me too? ^_^
[11:18] <lullabud> hikenboot:  apt-get remove gnome
[11:18] <mc44> hikenboot: install ubuntu-desktop then remove
[11:18] <jrib> Zarephath: export VARIABLE="value"      but what are you trying to compile?
[11:18] <nolimitsoya> dromer, anyone who wants an archiver
[11:18] <hikenboot> according to this it aint installed
[11:18] <piggyg1> dromer: i think for both of us hehehe
[11:18] <dromer> E: Couldn't find package p7zip-full
[11:18] <hikenboot> ok mc44
[11:18] <nolimitsoya> dromer, check your repolist then
[11:18] <piggyg1> dromer: but I'm curious im going to try winrar anyways to see if it works
[11:18] <Zarephath> jrib: swdec for flash for PPC
[11:19] <dromer> nolimitsoya: I have a rar archive with multiple rar's for one file (you get?)
[11:19] <dromer> nolimitsoya: afaik I have all universe on
[11:19] <dromer> where do I check ?
[11:19] <nolimitsoya> dromer, yes, and p7zip will handle those
[11:19] <dromer> yay
[11:19] <Zarephath> jrib: Keeps coming up with missing dev packages..and I just keep adding them...heh, however I thought maybe I could do it in a file in the packages for swdec?
[11:19] <nolimitsoya> dromer, /etc/apt/source.list
[11:19] <dromer> I'm on dapper btw
[11:19] <nolimitsoya> dromer, dont know about dapper...
[11:19] <dromer> e r.. that's empty :P
[11:20] <jrib> Zarephath: yeah README or INSTALL should list what you need.  libgdk-pixbuf-dev  is what I guess you want
[11:20] <nolimitsoya> dromer, sources.list then :)
[11:20] <quiet> is there a way to view all unofficial packages that are installed?
[11:20] <dromer> nolimitsoya: I have a couple multiverse in there
[11:20] <Zarephath> jrib: Hmmm..thought I grabbed that one up already as I apt-cache searched it...I will check it out thanks for the assist!
[11:21] <nolimitsoya> dromer, what about universe then?
[11:21] <dromer> hmm, but I opened archives before .. just can't remember with what :/
[11:21] <dromer> nolimitsoya: yeah even more universe, just not behind everything
[11:21] <nolimitsoya> dromer, unrar or unrar-free (or even rar) id guess
[11:22] <Zarephath> jrib: Yep it already had installed that dev package..ho, hum..
[11:22] <piggyg1> dromer: nope don't work :(
[11:22] <dromer> unrar-free didn't work then nolimitsoya
[11:22] <svein-erik> hallo
[11:23] <bunnythebunny> Guys, sometimes my system has a few odd glitches, which seem to, in a way or another, to fix themselves. But i want to know whats wrong. For example, sometimes i get odd messages about my audio drivers, and my computer starts to get a bit slow. Isnt there a place somewhere thats registering everything thats going on in Ubuntu? ..im not quite sure in what i mean but...perhaps you can enlighten me?
[11:24] <darkbuda> nolimitsoya: still the same error... :(
[11:24] <jrib> Zarephath: see how the configure script checks for it maybe
[11:24] <mc44> bunnythebunny: System -> Administration -> System Logs
[11:25] <Zarephath> jrib: Kewl thanks...will check now..still insisting on that darned pixbux 2.0 or greater even though I exported the variables
[11:25] <bunnythebunny> mc44, is there a way to do it directly through the terminal?
[11:25] <mc44> bunnythebunny: well you can just less or grep any of the files in /var/logs/
[11:25] <[Relic] > how do I tell if a font problem is a local java setting problem or a app problem?    Using blackdown I get big fonts, but when I was using the normal sun install I wasn't so I am wondering if there is a way to change some settings or if it is the app that is running that has the problem\
[11:26] <DanSchnell> How do I edit sources.list in Xubuntu?
[11:26] <bunnythebunny> hmm i see thanks
[11:26] <mc44> bunnythebunny: /var/log even
[11:26] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:27] <Senesence> Does anyone know the option that "grep" uses by default (if no option is provided). I think its "-G" but I'm not sure.
[11:27] <DanSchnell> nolimitsoya, Why does automatix website say gedit (Gnome) and kwrite (KDE) then?
[11:27] <nolimitsoya> !automatix
[11:27] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[11:27] <Apollo> do i have to do a disk scan or defrag the disk in ubuntu linux?
[11:27] <philc> how can I make use of the ruby1.9 package? If I install it I get ruby1.9 in /bin, but it would be great if the command "ruby" referred to the 1.9 environment. If I install the plain "ruby" package, I get a 1.8 environment (side by side with the 1.9)
[11:27] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, dont ever, ever even think about using automatix >_<
[11:27] <mc44> Senesence: yes it is -G
[11:27] <jrib> Apollo: no
[11:27] <DanSchnell> Nolimitsoya, is there anything better?
[11:27] <synjet> danschnell: they are all editors for the same funcn: editing the sources file
[11:27] <Senesence> mc44: Your sure right?
[11:27] <nolimitsoya> DanSchnell, yes, use apt or synaptic.
[11:27] <mc44> Senesence: see man grep
[11:28] <k6rfm> [Relic] : I don't know of any java settings to influence font selection, it would have to be in the app.  It may not be an app problem though...
[11:28] <DanSchnell> !synaptic
[11:28] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[11:28] <Apollo> jrib thanks but can you tell me why? a brief explanation maybe?
[11:28] <piggyg1> dromer: I give up until tommorow that is
[11:28] <Paradox34690> hey all
[11:28] <synjet> danschnell: there is an alternative: easyubuntu, though it has its supporters and haters
[11:28] <dromer> aarg, we want to watch southpark now :P
[11:28] <jrib> Apollo: fsck will check your partitions once in a while on its own (you'll probably notice on some boots).  ext3 doesn't really get defragmented
[11:28] <dromer> and I new how to do it before !!
[11:28] <Apollo> is it because of the tree structure?
[11:28] <DanSchnell> synjet, thanks
[11:29] <Zarephath> jrib: Ahh..Zar is starting to see the issue...it is calling out to pkg-config to read the metadata and that is what is halting the compile...let me grep that bugger
[11:29] <piggyg1> dromer: hmmm
[11:29] <piggyg1> dromer: wine works for rar.exe
[11:29] <Paradox34690> I'm a linux newbie, and I have a simple question (at least I think it's simple)... Is there a way I can add Welcome themes to my default selection?
[11:29] <k6rfm> [Relic] : Java has over the years done some pretty strange platform- and release- dependent things to figure out what fonts are available.  So it's not surprising that different Java builds give different results
[11:29] <Armagguedes> hello
[11:29] <Armagguedes> can someone recommend me a desktop file & content search engine, like guggel desktop?
[11:29] <jrib> Apollo: erm s/deframented/fragmented :)  I don't know the specifics as to why, apparently it's just more sensible than the windows stuff
[11:29] <piggyg1> dromer: I can give you the parm for that if you want
[11:29] <DanSchnell> Is synaptic even in xubuntu?
[11:29] <dromer> hm, ok
[11:29] <Apollo> jrib thanx
[11:29] <piggyg1> dromer: go get wine I'll get you the parm
[11:30] <mc44> synjet: DanSchnell the add/remove on the Applications menu should have most of what you want
[11:30] <Jowi> dromer, use "unrar"
[11:30] <k6rfm> [Relic]  frankly the easiest thing to do is just keep both java implementations installed and use the one that gives you the results you like
[11:30] <DanSchnell> Nevermind, i just answered my own question...
[11:30] <[Relic] > k6rfm,   is there a way to erradicate totally the blackdown install?  :)   still haven't found the 1.4 install instructions either
[11:30] <synjet> Paradox: system-->admin-->login window

[11:30] <dromer> Jowi: unrar-free doesn't open multiple archived files
[11:30] <Paradox34690> yes, i understand that part, but I mean, well... I guess the better question would have been where can I get additional themes? Like what should I be looking for?
[11:31] <Jowi> dromer, unrar-nonfree does
[11:31] <synjet> Paradox: gnome-look.org
[11:31] <Jowi> !info unrar

[11:31] <dromer> Jowi: I can't get that
[11:31] <Jowi> dromer, enable multiverse
[11:31] <dromer> hmm, where to do that again ?
[11:31] <k6rfm> [Relic]  when I installed blackdown (a while ago, and on Debian not Ubuntu) everything went in just one directory tree so I could just rm -fr it and then use the Deb preference system to point to the Sun java.  But things may be different now.

[11:32] <Jowi> dromer, in synaptic package manager.
[11:33] <dromer> Jowi: do multiverse everywhere ?
[11:33] <finalbeta> Luakagon, don't know, that's handled by the kernel as far as I know.
[11:33] <Jowi> ubotu, tell dromer about multiverse
[11:33] <finalbeta> normal keycombinations worked on my laptop
[11:33] <[Relic] > k6rfm,  thanks for the suggestions, I'll try it later if I get too annoyed with the bad fonts  :)

[11:38] <lullabud> fredJones840:  the boot disk images are on the cd, aren't they?
[11:38] <fredJones840> it wont boot from the cd .. the bios doesnt have that option
[11:38] <fredJones840> i need a floppy boot disk to change the bios option to boot from cd
[11:38] <finalbeta> mirak, never heard of conary, but aptitude is the shorter future I think.
[11:39] <sableslayer> yo
[11:39] <fredJones840> thats what im guessing anyway ..
[11:39] <piggyg1> dromer: yup it worked
[11:39] <mirak> finalbeta: aptitude is the same. the problems are depencies handling, and to complex package creation.
[11:40] <jdahm> is it better to install kubuntu or just install ubuntu and install the KDE packages?
[11:40] <mirak> finalbeta: I often heard about rpm hell, well, I have been trough deb and apt hell a lot of time !
[11:40] <dromer> piggyg1: I don't need wine for that ;)
[11:40] <piggyg1> jdahm: the only problem I found with Kubuntu is that wine isn't easy to install
[11:40] <piggyg1> jdahm: so I'm on ubuntu now
[11:41] <jdahm> piggyg1: I have always used ubuntu and I like gnome, but its been a while since I have used KDE, so I want to give it a whirl again
[11:41] <mattl> lo
[11:41] <finalbeta> mirak, so have I. i'm starting to hate software repositories, they are handy for new comers, but hell if you need a single new library or soemthing. I want exe installers ;)
[11:41] <piggyg1> dromer: :)  so you got it?
[11:42] <mirak> finalbeta: exactly. I am running through this for VDR.
[11:42] <fredJones840> hmm .. ne 1 have ne boot disk ideas? the dos on here has no commands either ..
[11:42] <piggyg1> jdahm: I like KDE you should give the livecd a shot
[11:42] <mirak> finalbeta: and I don't like userhatingness of gentoo
[11:42] <fatejudger> does anyone know how to disable that stupid clippy clone in OO.o?
[11:42] <fatejudger> a browse through the options seemed to yield no results...
[11:43] <piggyg1> so now for my question
[11:43] <piggyg1> Has anyone tried to compile partimage on ubuntu?
[11:43] <mirak> finalbeta: in fact they should port emerge to debian or something like that, to have a good tool for building in /usr/local/
[11:43] <dromer> piggyg1: I got multiverse sources up and downloaded unrar-nonfree :)
[11:43] <finalbeta> mirak, don't know VDR. But if you want to update a single component, you need to compile the source, and create a.deb package yourself, and then install that. Worked for me when I wanted to add new perl libs today
[11:43] <jdahm> piggyg1: but you can install KDE on ubuntu, right? so whats the downside to that option?
[11:43] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Can you upgrade that IBM to a newer BIOS perhaps ?
[11:43] <dromer> and that works
[11:44] <piggyg1> jdahm: no clue, I haven't tried it
[11:44] <fredJones840> hmm ..
[11:44] <piggyg1> jdahm: I would see a downside its just a GUI in my opinion
[11:44] <piggyg1> jdahm: I mean wouldn't
[11:44] <piggyg1> dromer: kool kool
[11:45] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Either that, or get in touch with some local computer store that takes trade-ins and get something that is a bit more up to date for short $$....
[11:46] <fredJones840> right .. i was hoping i could find a way to run this ubuntu for no cash .. heh
[11:46] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Understand....
[11:46] <mirak> finalbeta: I prefer hung myself than creating a package.
[11:46] <fredJones840> i m poor .. heh
[11:46] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: But, I have found several computers for zip that work well for Ubuntu.....
[11:47] <ciphex> hey guys
[11:47] <mirak> finalbeta: the only way I ever did packages was with checkinstall
[11:47] <mirak> finalbeta: checkinstall is fine for managing local installs
[11:47] <id_> Hi
=== ubuntu4alexej is now known as AV1611
[11:47] <ciphex> can anyone suggest a cheap PCI audio card that will work well under ubuntu dapper?
=== id_ is now known as i|D
[11:48] <crimsun> ciphex: sound blaster live (non-24-bit, non-7.1)
[11:48] <ciphex> something of the soundblaster flavor?
[11:48] <i|D> I used ubuntu since today, before linux.
[11:48] <i|D> -d
[11:48] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: As some of us are. You need to look around perhaps, you know, the neighborhood etc, and maybe post at the local store like I did and was glad to go pick-up someones computer when they were doing upgrade and tossing out old one to thrash.....
[11:48] <i|D> Can anyone help me at XChat?
[11:48] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: I was most thankful.....
[11:48] <fredJones840> that is a good idea
[11:48] <finalbeta> mirak, I agree, it's hellish. one of the most basic things ubuntu will have to somehow fix. Ubuntu is supposed to give us freedom, but you feel suffocated in situations like that ;p
[11:48] <fredJones840> this one i s here is my dads old office pc
[11:49] <i|D> I looked every in settings, but how can I remove the "channel list" on connect :p
[11:49] <i|D> the /list
[11:49] <ciphex> crimsun: any ideas on a specific model... i did pick upo a soundblaster live but it won't do the trick. it's some odd model i guess
[11:49] <Spee_Der> Cool....
[11:49] <i|D> can anyone help me? :)
[11:49] <fredJones840> i just figured i could mess around with it .. but i guess its just too old
[11:49] <crimsun> ciphex: avoid all 24-bit and 7.1 ones. Use one of the old ones.
[11:50] <ciphex> hmm. ok. i guess i'll look round on ebay. if i find something suitable mind if i holla back at you for advice on it?
[11:50] <mirak> finalbeta: the realease cycle of 6 months doesnet help either
[11:50] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Also, if you have a local 'transfer' station, you ay wnt to check with them and see if they have a bin for peoples who are throwing away their computers and such..... This also works... I doesn't hurt to ask them too.....
[11:51] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Not too old, just too much work is all.....
[11:51] <mirak> finalbeta: it seems foresight linux is using conary, and it seems advanced in comparison of apt. problem of apt is that it's too old now
[11:51] <finalbeta> mirak, it's simply wishful thinking that everything can be delivered in the repositories.
[11:51] <fredJones840> yea too true
[11:51] <Some_Person> Can I set Ubuntu to not show volume labels and show the folder they're mounted to like Breezy did?
[11:51] <fredJones840> well shitty .. i was hoping there was going to be easy solution somewhere .. hehe
[11:51] <mirak> finalbeta: well there is to much depencies I think.
[11:52] <mirak> finalbeta: the worst depencies problem happens with devel packages
[11:52] <finalbeta> mirak, I don't know conary, I don't totally dislike apt-get though, and feisty will be adding some nice features to it.
[11:52] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Well, for what it is worth..... It won't hurt to shop around and find a source. There are plenty of places these days that recycle all the computers and related stuff......
[11:52] <mirak> finalbeta: in fact it's totaly impossible to build a whole apt repository on the same install
[11:52] <Wolf-h26> guys,how do I view wmp movies on website from firefox?
[11:53] <Some_Person> For example, if a partition is mounted to /media/hda1 it shows the volume label (in this case, LOCAL DISK); can I set it to show hda1?
[11:53] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Once a month drop off's and all that......
[11:53] <fredJones840> right
[11:53] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Good place to hang around when folks are bringing in all the computer related material......
[11:53] <finalbeta> mirak, just reading about conary, seems to good to be true. so It will never happen :p
[11:53] <mirak> finalbeta: I think the package conflicts are more bound to a the linux file system hierarchy.
[11:54] <Some_Person> hello???
[11:54] <fredJones840> ja .. but you prolly live in the city
[11:54] <Spee_Der> Hello Some.....
[11:54] <mc44> Some_Person: yes????
[11:54] <fredJones840> i live in the middle of f in now where
[11:54] <Some_Person> Can I set Ubuntu to not show volume labels and show the folder they're mounted to like Breezy did?
[11:54] <Spee_Der> fredJones840: Actually, I'm quite rural.....
[11:54] <fredJones840> no where even
[11:54] <Wolf-h26> ..
[11:54] <mirak> finalbeta: gobo linux is proposing to have a file system similar to windows. in fact the advantage of having each application in it's own folder is that you can have more than one version of the same application, so it reduce conflicts problems I believe
[11:56] <Wolf-h26> guys,how do I view wmp movies on website from firefox?
[11:56] <finalbeta> mirak, yes, I saw it, I didn't even bother reading more, it will never happen. The file hierarchy is cult to linux freaks. They will never admit it's "inconvenient"
[11:56] <amicke> Hi, could anyone help me to get d-link airplus to work with airsnort or kismet?
[11:56] <mc44> finalbeta: please be nice
[11:56] <Some_Person> oy! why wont anyone answer me?!
[11:56] <pet> hello

[11:57] <finalbeta> mc44, I don't believe I was "not nice". I doubt I said something that's not true.

[11:57] <Some_Person> someone ban pet

[11:57] <amicke> welldone
[11:57] <Spee_Der> ty
[11:57] <Some_Person> thank you
[11:58] <finalbeta> mc44, a thread about the file system hierarchy is posted on the forums, I never replied for the same reason.
[11:58] <mc44> finalbeta: Im sure theres a rational debate to be had over the linux file structucture, however discussing it here, and calling people freaks is not the way to do it
[11:58] <highneko> What do you all think of my animation? http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f295/numbers6554/highneko_v011.gif
[11:58] <LjL> guys, use the bot's !ops trigger when there is an emergency (and ONLY when there is an emergency)
[11:58] <amicke> how can i turn on monitor mode for my DWL-G650
[11:58] <Some_Person> I know Ubuntu Breezy did not show volume labels. Dapper does. I want Dapper to not show them. Is there a way?
[11:59] <Spee_Der> highneko: Way cool !
[11:59] <highneko> ;)
[11:59] <Some_Person> and whats the name of the file that lets you make a drive automount?
[11:59] <highneko> I got another comment " Did that cat just shoot... globs of gray crap at the windows logo? 9/10 for creativity... beyond my comprehension."
[11:59] <Spee_Der> highneko: That's just too funny, can't wait to show the family ! ! !
[11:59] <Joe_CoT> Some_Person: /etc/fstab
[11:59] <Some_Person> thanks
[11:59] <ciphex> can anyone tell me if they think this card would work well in ubuntu dapper?
