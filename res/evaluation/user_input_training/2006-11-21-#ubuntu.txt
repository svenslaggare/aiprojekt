[12:04] <Seveas> netsplits cause lag
[12:04] <LjL> Seveas, no. it's funny to see them excess flood a couple of seconds later
[12:04] <Seveas> especially since the bots were on the bad side
[12:05] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[12:05] <rioghal> lol @ enjoy the show

[12:06] <czedlitz> was wierd
[12:06] <DjViper> jesse__: okay
[12:07] <jesse__> you got it

[12:09] <DjViper> jesse__: first of all, the script you sent me didnt have the proper files and did not look for the correct card, so I edited it

[12:09] <Jinkguns_> What filesystem would unix be running in 1996? I can't access this disk. :/
[12:10] <kitche> Jinkguns_: unix or linux?
[12:10] <Jinkguns_> backing up old research data from a nanomedicine lab
[12:10] <Jinkguns_> it says Unix backups and it can't mount the fs
[12:10] <Jinkguns_> On the disk
[12:10] <Jinkguns_> So I'd say unix
[12:10] <kitche> Jinkguns_: probably it's UFS

[12:10] <Andi1984> hi
[12:10] <kitche> Jinkguns_: no linxu can't read UFS
[12:11] <nekr0z> Once again, can anyone help with compose key?
[12:11] <kitche> Jinkguns_: it might be the filesystem that Solaris uses as well
[12:11] <Jinkguns_> not even with a plugin?

[12:11] <Andi1984> I've a problem with the fish-shell... is there anyone can help me?
[12:12] <jesse__> Arcad3:> I am a webmaster
[12:12] <Arcad3> some tips
[12:12] <jesse__> dang i'm tired
[12:12] <Jinkguns_> Well how do I access UFS then?
[12:12] <Arcad3> can u give me/
[12:12] <jesse__> Arcad3:> Give you what?
[12:12] <nekr0z> Jinkguns_: can't you just mount it?
[12:12] <Arcad3> u use cpanel/
[12:13] <Jinkguns_> no it wont mount
[12:13] <kitche> Jinkguns_: it's what BSD uses

=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[12:13] <Arcad3> what automatic system for clients to register themselves?shakk i use?
[12:13] <Jinkguns_> Linux should be able to read UFS with the right kernel module.
[12:13] <nekr0z> Jinkguns_: I have no ufs to try, but man mount supposes they can be mounted
[12:14] <bimberi> Jinkguns_: There are ways to find out the FS by dd-ing the first few blocks on the device to a file and examining its contents - which will contain a FS signature.  I've never done it but been to a talk on it.  Google will hopefully help more (sorry, I hate having to say that).
[12:14] <jesse__> Arcad3:> Don't really know I'm use to just making and publishing the website not really anything else
[12:14] <clayg> someone say something abt cpanel?
[12:14] <jesse__> yes Arcad3 did
[12:14] <kitche> Jinkguns_: if it can't mount it then it's probably Solaris filesystem
[12:14] <Jinkguns_> hmm
[12:14] <Jinkguns_> So what do I need to access it then?
[12:15] <see> is there a way to tell the kernel to migrate stuff that are in the swap into real ram?
[12:15] <Arcad3> aa
[12:15] <Jinkguns_> If Ubuntu can access NTFS, HFS, etc, it should have no problem with UFS or Solaris flavor.
[12:15] <Arcad3> i want to host sites
[12:15] <Andi1984> does anyone knows about the fish-shell?
[12:15] <Arcad3> thanks anyway
[12:15] <jesse__> I can make sites

[12:17] <Agrajag> Jinkguns_: do you know what OS that backup was from?
[12:17] <Agrajag> you said "unix" but that's a pretty wide field
[12:17] <Jinkguns_> The disk says "Unix Backup" and its dated from 1996.
[12:17] <kitche> Jinkguns_: well Solaris uses UFS but their is some Unix systems that use a special filesystem
[12:17] <Jinkguns_> Thats all the info I have.
[12:17] <Jinkguns_> :P

[12:20] <RegalEagle> Fluxbox looks awesome and the description says it integrates with X
[12:20] <windowz_exile> try it.. and we will all know

[12:30] <dm__> Anyone have experience with Coolbits in edgy?
[12:30] <elkbuntu> nekr0z, have you tried asking in #kubuntu at all? they'd be the people to know what you're missing
[12:30] <bruenig> !metaquestion
[12:30] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:30] <dm__> !coolbits
[12:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about coolbits - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:31] <bruenig> what is coolbits and what is your problem
[12:31] <dm__> coolbits is an nvidia overclocker, and i cant get it to show up in nvidia-settings
[12:31] <nekr0z> elkbuntu: I'll go and try, but don't think they have a clue - this one seems like GNOME's problem
=== cj_ is now known as cj
[12:31] <kitche> dm__: they made a linux version of it? I always thought it was for windows
[12:32] <dm__> coolbits comes with their drivers
[12:32] <LjL> !info nvclock | dm__, dunno about coolbits, but there's this
[12:32] <ubotu> nvclock: Allows you to overclock your nVidia card under GNU/Linux. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.8b-1 (edgy), package size 41 kB, installed size 160 kB
[12:32] <dm__> its not a program, just info with the driver

[12:32] <aimtrainer> hi! I have a problem downloading stuff from xdcc bots. I have xchat set on auto accept dcc sends. But the transfers dont start under "remaining" it always says "starting" and afte a couple of secs I get a msg from the bot htat I have a transfer pending - can anyone hlp m eplease
[12:32] <aimtrainer>  before I had another distro and an older xchat and I didnt have that problem
[12:32] <aimtrainer>  I never had any ports forwarded for irc
[12:32] <kitche> dm__: coolbits actually is a seperate add on
[12:32] <dm__> ljl well im using NVclock, but it doesnt actually change the clock speed, no perf increase
[12:33] <dm__> ljl dm@dm-laptop:~$ nvclock_gtk
[12:33] <dm__> bash: nvclock_gtk: command not found
[12:33] <Rebirth> any LD gurus here?
[12:33] <bense> okay, so i come from gentoo, is there a way of "updating portage" with ubuntu?
[12:33] <LjL> !info nvclock-gtk | dm__, it's a package you have to install
[12:33] <ubotu> nvclock-gtk: Allows you to overclock your nVidia card under GNU/Linux. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.8b-1 (edgy), package size 198 kB, installed size 500 kB
[12:34] <LjL> anyway afaik it just does the same thing that plain nvclock does - only using a GTK interface instead of a text one
[12:34] <dm__> ljl happen to have a repo ? i dont seem to have that
[12:34] <nekr0z> elkbuntu: People in #kubuntu don't seem to know anything on this subject.

[12:34] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell dm__ about universe | dm__, you have a private message from Ubotu
[12:34] <kitche> bense: if you mean apt just do sudo apt-get update but ubuntu freezes their packages
[12:35] <Nativow> any help with openssl?
[12:35] <LjL> dm__: it's just in universe

[12:35] <dm__> ljl ok thanks ill work on it

[12:38] <LjL> dm__: but you can do it graphically from Synaptic just as well
[12:38] <dm__> ljl !easysource gave me dapper stuff, im on edgy
[12:38] <sgirc> a dmesg prints lines lke unknow symbol ppp_channel_index
[12:38] <LjL> dm__: well just change dapper into edgy... but anyway, the wiki pages have the lines
[12:39] <sgirc> does this mean thaht i need to recompile kernel ?
[12:39] <dm__> ljl ok ty
[12:39] <RegalEagle> I installed Fluxbox from Synaptic, do I need to restart X now?
[12:39] <bruenig> RegalEagle, yeah, I believe you pick fluxbox from the sessions menu

[12:42] <sgirc> binberi it's ok:) do u know why it didn"t work with insmod sorry
[12:42] <bimberi> sgirc: insmod just shoves the module into the kernel without considering dependencies.  modprobe will insert any dependant modules

[12:58] <asthla>  hi i am new to ubuntu and was having trouble getting my screensaver daemon to start on boot
[01:00] <bluefox83> where would irssi send a file you got through dcc?
[01:00] <snype> hey
[01:00] <rukuartic> bluefox83: Where you started Irssi I guess. You could try "locate <filename>"
[01:00] <Some_Person> why doesnt edgy come in shipit?
[01:00] <bluefox83> rukuartic, so if i'm in my home directory and i start irssi, that's where it'll show up?
[01:00] <bhudda> lo?
[01:00] <LjL> Some_Person: because Dapper is LTS, so they chose to ship that instead
[01:00] <snype> its still beta
[01:01] <LjL> snype: no it's not
[01:01] <snype> really?
[01:01] <snype> my bad
[01:01] <LjL> !edgy
[01:01] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download
[01:01] <Some_Person> that sucks
[01:01] <lupine_85> anyone else using the 9742 nvidia drivers?
[01:01] <snype> if you want me to ship 'em to you pm me
[01:01] <kitche> bluefox83: it might be in .irssi
[01:02] <alternatesirk> is anyone familiar with loading screensaver daemon on boot?
[01:02] <CharlieSu> I'm at work but have SSHed into my home pc.. What is the best way for me to start a torrent in azureus on my home PC from work?  I can forward X11 for azureus but wont it stop when I close the SSH connection?
[01:02] <DarkSpirit> I am trying to install NVidia drivers, I think I installed them but not correctly. I cannot set my screen resolution to 1280x1024 max it goes to is 1024x786
[01:02] <Some_Person> so i cant have the latest ubuntu version because of my dialup
[01:02] <snype> Some_Person I'd say that's about correct
[01:03] <rukuartic> CharlieSu: You might be able to do something in "screen"... I'm not sure how that'd work though.
[01:03] <Some_Person> shipit is the reason i chose ubuntu over other distros
[01:03] <snype> so wait
[01:03] <Some_Person> my dialup didnt restrict my having it
[01:03] <snype> it'll be shipit soon enough... hopefully- I'll tell ya though I love it!
[01:03] <CharlieSu> rukuartic: i'm in screen right now.. but you can forward X11 in screen
[01:04] <LjL> Some_Person: do you pay by time?
[01:04] <CharlieSu> rukuartic: it gives a $DISPLAY error
[01:04] <Some_Person> no
[01:04] <rukuartic> CharlieSu: Hurm. You could always try a command line torrent program
[01:04] <Some_Person> by the month
[01:04] <Some_Person> $10 a month
[01:04] <CharlieSu> rukuartic: can you suggest one?
[01:04] <snype> dsl = 14 a month
[01:04] <snype> why not get that?
[01:04] <Some_Person> but they're going out of business
[01:04] <CharlieSu> rukuartic: also, possibly something like PeerGuardian/SafePeer
[01:04] <LjL> Some_Person: then why don't you just download it? it'll take long, but if it's for free...
[01:04] <Some_Person> my damn apartments dont allow it
[01:04] <rukuartic> CharlieSu: rtorrent, not sure...
[01:05] <Some_Person> i could, but i need the phone line for calling
[01:05] <snype> anyone here using a thinkpad for their ubuntu
[01:05] <Some_Person> so no
[01:05] <LjL> Some_Person: what about during the night?
[01:05] <Some_Person> no

[01:11] <rukuartic> DarkSpirit: Just don't try to make copy ctrl+c... thats short for "exit program"
[01:11] <Agrajag> What if the application you're running in that  terminal uses ctrl+v for something?
[01:11] <rukuartic> Agrajag: didn't say it was a good idea. I've run into few problems when I used it a while back.

[01:15] <rioghal> slavik, seen this page?  http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/index.html
[01:15] <bimberi> slavik: i took your question at face value
[01:15] <bimberi> as are others
[01:15] <slavik> bimberi: sorry
[01:15] <bimberi> slavik: np :)
[01:15] <slavik> the trouble is that there is error with glade plugin code ...

[01:16] <RaiderX> Hey I need the build-essential package.
[01:16] <slavik> and I am trying to get it to compile with all plugins
[01:16] <slavik> RaiderX: 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'

[01:16] <RaiderX> i cant do that
[01:16] <slavik> rioghal: :P

[01:17] <kitche> slavik: if there is no valgrind-dev package then download the source for valgrind
[01:17] <slavik> rukuartic: yes, but now that gedit has built in terminal, I don't really care that anjuta 2 must set up a project even for single file compiles
[01:17] <bimberi> RaiderX: do you have an Ubuntu CD? build-essential and its dependencies are on it
[01:18] <slavik> kitche: but the only source they have is 3.2.1 and it doesn't compile ...
[01:18] <RaiderX> so they install with ubuntu, or they jsut sit on the CD?

[01:36] <cfedde> warlock[S] : in what way do you want it to support swedish?
[01:36] <morten> mitrovarr: partitionmagic
[01:36] <Agrajag> mitrovarr: I've done it with parted before
[01:36] <Agrajag> and ntfsresize
[01:36] <mitrovarr> morten:  did that ever become free?  it didn't used to be
[01:36] <rukuartic> Brokenstein: I think XFS wasn't too bad, but it was shakey
[01:36] <slavik> mitrovarr: yes, because partition magic can do it ...
[01:37] <morten> mitrovarr: dunno. i don't know if it's available for linux at all. but since you have an ntfs partition, i presume you have a dualboot, so that shouldn't be a problem.
[01:37] <iBashUsr> morten: nothing... just a kernel patch
[01:37] <morten> i doubt it's free, though
[01:37] <morten> iBashUsr: perhaps it's in universe or multiverse
[01:37] <mitrovarr> morten:  It's not for me, actually, it's for a friend who wants to resize his ntfs and set up a dual boot
[01:38] <iBashUsr> morten: i have multiverse
[01:38] <superkirbyartist> Anyone knows if I can Wine Lexmark drivers?
[01:38] <morten> mitrovarr: in that case he needs a windows tool in either case, doesn't he? i recommend partition magic.
[01:38] <mitrovarr> morten:  negative experiences with resizing partitions in the past has convinced me to set them up properly at install for many years :-)
[01:38] <Agrajag> mitrovarr: you don't have to do it with windows toold
[01:38] <morten> mitrovarr: of course. but he's asking.
[01:38] <funkyHat> morten, mitrovarr, the ubuntu install CD will resize ntfs partitions for you...
[01:38] <DaVeG> evad could you please give me a copy of ur vitrual hosts file? i've not got much idea what to do
[01:38] <maxxism> anyone here try out the newest version of Parallels under ubuntu?
[01:39] <morten> iBashUsr: it's there, dude. "hibernate - smartly puts your computer to sleep (suspend to RAM or disk)"
[01:39] <mitrovarr> funkyhat:  I understand it will try, but will it work?
[01:39] <rukuartic> Hurm. I've installed Ubuntu, and I want to dualboot with Windows. However, that means losing grub. Anyone have tips on how to reinstall grub (without floppies)
[01:39] <iBashUsr> morten: oh? that one? lol
[01:39] <DarkSpirit> What is the difference between the GENERIC and non one in GRUB when you start up your PC ?
[01:39] <corevette> is there a reason my internet ubuntu works when run on vmware through windows, but it doesn't work when run by itself?
[01:39] <mitrovarr> funkyhat:  and does he have to check and defrad the disk first?
[01:39] <iBashUsr> morten: i was looking for something that says suspend2 or suspend... yeah... i see that package
[01:39] <evad> DaVeG: umm, I can't really, it's for work ;)
[01:40] <DaVeG> evad, could you edit out the parts i dont need to see? ^^
[01:40] <warlock[S] > cfedde, some symbols, like , or (c) the copyright sign, isn't showed at some index pages
[01:40] <warlock[S] > is there a way to fix this ?
[01:40] <evad> no, I need to go to bed, sorry :(
[01:41] <DaVeG> okies
[01:41] <cfedde> warlock[S] : apache has ways to support internationalization.  iirc one of the methods is triggered by adding a .se to the end of files that are specificaly swedish.  But then I'm just a yokel from the US so what do I know.
[01:42] <warlock[S] > hmm
[01:42] <warlock[S] > but is ther some other way to fix this ?
[01:42] <superkirbyartist> Can I use my Windows drivers on Ubuntu with Wine?
[01:42] <warlock[S] > ex, in apache.conf or somethniog.
[01:42] <mjr> superkirbyartist, no
[01:42] <superkirbyartist> mjr: Why not?
[01:42] <cfedde> warlock[S] : it's supported by the character set that the page sends to the browser.
[01:42] <mjr> because Wine doesn't do that
[01:43] <cfedde> character encoding even.
[01:43] <cfedde> I should shut up though and let someone who knows the answer speak
[01:43] <mitrovarr> alright
[01:43] <mitrovarr> well thanks guys, hopefully it'll work for him
[01:44] <DarkSpirit> Is there a HOWTo for Beryl

[01:44] <ubotu> DarkSpirit: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[01:44] <DarkSpirit> I installed it, but not perfectly it seems
[01:44] <Litropy> Hi, all. My ubuntu installation is hanging at "Starting up the partitioner" (scanning disks...). I previously installed Yellow Dog Linux, and that might have something to do with it. I formatted my 2GB swap partition using the GNOME Partition Editor, then within the ubuntu installer I selected the partition I used for YDL, and checked the option to format it. I am currently running on the install CD. Thanks in advance for your help.

[01:53] <maxxism> Harry that would be awesome
[01:53] <stalefries> Harry, talk to Dink
[01:53] <kitche> dm: you have to add a line to your xorg.conf under Device for your nvidia card and it should be Option "Coolbits" "1" then you will be bale to use coolbits
[01:53] <eric> anyone can help me my mouse is totally erratic,
[01:53] <Harry> maxxisom u can
[01:53] <Harry> dink
[01:53] <maxxism> nice
[01:53] <snido> ErKitche, what about onboard GPU?
[01:53] <Dink> Harry, im going to try in about 20min
[01:53] <Harry> nice
[01:53] <maxxism> will any ppc version work?
[01:53] <Harry> u get everything

[01:53] <Dink> waiting for the dvd to finish downloading
[01:53] <Harry> maxxism yes
[01:53] <Harry> dink u get all those
[01:54] <snido> I have GeForce 6100 GPU and chipsets too. Will the geforce driver install drivers for all of that?
[01:54] <Dink> no need for patches if you using the PPC version from what I heard .. but bootloader yes
[01:54] <Harry> dink pm
=== matti_ is now known as matti
[01:54] <Harry> dink ps3 kernal patches
[01:54] <Harry> u get those
[01:54] <maxxism> Dink keep us posted.  you should make a video of it and post it on youtube.  I am seeing lots of Fedora ones already
[01:54] <Dink> i think the kernel patches are for the regular version
[01:55] <Dink> maxxism, i will try but i dont think i will be successful cuz im sure others have tried
[01:55] <kitche> snido: you would probably have to use the nforce drivers
[01:55] <rad|x> anyone can help me with module compilation problem?
[01:55] <snido> so not graphic display driver, only the nforce one?
[01:55] <snido> or both?
[01:55] <kalikiana> Is there a way to make java app(let)s look like gtk apps?
[01:55] <Harry> dink http://www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatform/index.html
[01:55] <snido> Nvidia Display Driver + nDriver
[01:55] <bhudda> muahah Beryl is super cool!
[01:55] <snido> nForce i mean
[01:55] <stalefries> kalikiana, doubt it
[01:55] <kitche> snido: both the line I said gets added to xorg.conf
[01:56] <Dink> Harry yeah i already have that installed
[01:56] <Dink> that installs kboot
[01:56] <Dink> and from kboot you install your distro
[01:56] <Dink> thats where i got stuck last time with ubuntu/kubuntu
[01:56] <stalefries> kalikiana, java apps should already use gtk, otherwise, tough luck
[01:56] <snido> yeah, i oughta to follow nvidia's installation instruction. its on driver dl page
[01:56] <snido> thanks
[01:57] <Dink> i couldnt figure out how to start the installation
[01:57] <Harry> dink
[01:57] <Harry> take photos and maybe video
[01:57] <Dink> if I succeed i will
[01:57] <Dink> even post a howto
[01:57] <Harry> take of isntall as well
[01:57] <maxxism> good luck Dink.  hope it works.
[01:57] <Harry> dink u got 20 gb or 60
[01:57] <Litropy> alright - I have a partition that's 31.50KiB that GPEditor can't recognize - I'm thinking that's my bootloader. Could I format that and not mess things up? I do still want to choose whether to boot into OS X or Ubuntu...
[01:57] <Dink> lol it didnt work last night but it might be cuz i wasnt using the DVD install
[01:57] <Dink> 60
[01:57] <kalikiana> stalefries: i do only have gtk2, so i assume they are using pure x - which is ugly
[01:57] <Harry> dink only dvd workd
[01:57] <Harry> that y
[01:57] <stalefries> Litropy: leave it alone
[01:58] <Dink> yeah i read that today
[01:58] <Harry> lol
[01:58] <Litropy> right on, stalefries
[01:58] <Dink> 20min or so till it finishes downloading
[01:58] <stalefries> kalikiana, if it doesn't look like gtk in the first place, you don't have much of a chance of fixing it, unless you modify the source yourself and do it

[01:59] <Harry> dink ure supposed ot formt
[01:59] <sn00p|> anybody have any experience using nfs client ubuntu server freebsd?
[01:59] <Dink> i know i did it after i beat resistance and had to lose my beat game :(
[01:59] <stalefries> Harry, Dink, could you two take this to something like #ubuntu-offtopic please?
[01:59] <maxxism> funny how any PPC distro will work with Cell processors.  I know Cell is a PPC derivative,  but i doubt the normal PPC linux kernel will take advantage of all the Cell features????
[01:59] <morten> is there any reasonable explanation why i'm unable to remove nvidia-glx, nvidia-kernel-common and nvidia-kernel-source without completely removing xorg in the process?
[02:00] <Dink> ubuntu ppc is supported here isnt it ?
[02:00] <stalefries> Dink, sure, but you're talking about other stuff
[02:00] <stalefries> Dink, maye you and Harry could do this over IM?

[02:08] <Olipro> can IE7 be run with a wrapper or anything though?

[02:08] <Olipro> ah, ok
[02:08] <rioghal> wasp_ems, do you have another desktop/windw manager on that box now? if so, you can remove xfce now and install flux or install flux and then remove xfce, its up to you

[02:13] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[02:13] <Kingsqueak> nanotube: create a 'noauto' mount in /etc/fstab for the share, that way you can mount when you want
[02:13] <stalefries> nanotube: OpenOffice must have special support or something
[02:13] <t9k326> does anyone has tried speech recognition on ubuntu/kubuntu?

[02:17] <dibblego> I have my disk partitioned into two / and /home - is there any software I can use to join them together as one partition?
[02:18] <hikenboot> I do apt-cache search dtc and dont find anything and internet search isn't much better
[02:18] <Kingsqueak> hikenboot: Domain Technologies Control panel maybe?
[02:18] <stalefries> t9k326: that site hass certificate problems
[02:18] <Kingsqueak> hikenboot: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu6.06_dtc_isp_server maybe that can help?
[02:18] <Litropy> dibblego: Idunno - that sounds highly implausible to me
[02:18] <Kingsqueak> nanotube: yeah looks like it can do it
[02:19] <t9k326> stalefries: yep, but its real
[02:19] <stalefries> t9k326: there's an english portion there
[02:19] <stalefries> t9k326: looks interesting!
[02:19] <t9k326> stalefries: at leidn't broke my office's win2k..
[02:19] <stalefries> t9k326: 'apt-cache search gervoice'
[02:19] <hikenboot> Kingsqueak, what did you search for I was unable to find it on google
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> hikenboot: 'apache DTC'
[02:20] <dibblego> Litropy, surely I can at least extend a partition?
[02:20] <snido> hey why my os is called edubuntu instead of just ubuntu?
[02:20] <dibblego> in which case, I'd copy everything across from one partition, extend it, then copy it back
=== quuxo is now known as quux
[02:20] <t9k326> stalefries: oks I will try searching for it Thanks a lot (I fynalli go home!
[02:20] <dibblego> snido, because you installed the edubuntu distribution

[02:23] <kmkmeka> has anyone figured how to fix the internal card reader on edgy?
[02:23] <Litropy> dibblego: partitioning is very common - there should be plenty on google. I'd google myself, but I'm currently running on CD while installing ubuntu
[02:23] <dibblego> righto thanks

[02:25] <DrSmall> it said it did

[02:26] <jrib> DrSmall: what is the last thing it says
[02:26] <kmkmeka> ive tried usb it works ok
[02:26] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: does 'lsusb' show you the reader?
[02:26] <stalefries> cmweb, firewalls prevent sharing :)
[02:26] <DrSmall> i dunno. i'd have to look again
[02:26] <cmweb> in fire starter it has a section on internet sharring
[02:26] <kmkmeka> no
[02:26] <stalefries> cmweb, hmm. interesting
[02:26] <DrSmall> windows won't even boot up
[02:27] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: does 'lsmod | grep usb' show you anything?
[02:27] <cmweb> stalefries, it has dhcp control and everything hard to imagin it blocs shaarring
[02:28] <hikenboot> anyone know if i can use a debian apt-source on my ubuntu box.my guess is no but...
[02:28] <stalefries> cmweb: i think your computer with the firewall needs to be set up as a router, ie, have 2 network cards, 1 for in, 1 for out
[02:28] <stalefries> hikenboot: it may break something
[02:28] <Kingsqueak> hikenboot: it will 'see' the repository but the packages , debs , may not work, likely they won't
[02:28] <cmweb> staalefries, thats whaat im after... :-/
[02:28] <kmkmeka> usbcore               134912  3 ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd

[02:29] <stalefries> b14ck73425: I have, a little. not much
[02:29] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: then do the lsmod again see if it picks it up
[02:29] <kmkmeka> connection i think is pci
[02:30] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: ah
[02:30] <b14ck73425> is it similar to front page?
[02:30] <stalefries> b14ck73425: dunno, never used front page. Isn't front page for page layout?
[02:30] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: any clue how it was supported before as in what kernel module?
[02:30] <cmweb> stalefries, belive it or not but Firestarter is talking me through the process of shaarring i got to do a command "apt-get install dhcp" then go
[02:30] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: or the name of the device actually?
[02:30] <stalefries> cmweb: cool
[02:30] <stalefries> b14ck73425: for page layout and stuff, look into scribus
[02:30] <b14ck73425> i was refering to windows FrontPage program?
[02:30] <stalefries> right
[02:31] <stalefries> I know the program, never used it
[02:31] <Harry> dink

[02:33] <kmkmeka> it worked in daper
[02:33] <cmweb> kingsqueak, thats where it is
[02:33] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: it's telling you you must setup the config file or the server won't start
[02:34] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: /etc/dhcpd.conf, edit that for your needs, this is the dhcpd *server* not the client btw
[02:34] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: what laptop model is it exactly, maybe I can find something?
[02:34] <cmweb> well i must ahve got it set up because firestarter detected it
[02:35] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: well line 29 of that paste tells you it isn't started, what's 'sudo ps aux | grep dhc'  show you?
[02:36] <cmweb> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33042/

[02:37] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: what make/model laptop, maybe I can find something on it
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: do you want to serve IPs to your network or get an ip using dhcp?
[02:38] <khaije1> Kingsqueak: i'm not saying it's a big difference but the sudo in 'sudo ps aux | grep dhc' is not necessary because ps will happily accept those parameters without root access
[02:38] <cmweb> I want it as eaasy aas possible
[02:38] <cmweb> my moms buggin me to get it working
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> khaije1: ps won't list all processes to a non root user though
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> khaije1: run it as you and run it as root, it's different output
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> unless ubuntu does something funny with ps
[02:39] <cmweb> Kingsqueak, il use DHCP windows likes it so i like it
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> khaije1: hmm maybe it does
[02:39] <khaije1> just a fyi :-)
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: o.k. so that is already all set with dhclient
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> khaije1: that isn't 'normal' on other systems heh
[02:39] <wasp_ems> does anyone know what might be the problem in the case where i am trying to print a page and even though my printer goes through the whole progress nothing it written on the paper?

[02:40] <cmweb> kingsqueak, so....
[02:40] <stalefries> wasp_ems: ink levels?
[02:40] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: you want windows boxes to GET IPs from your server?
[02:41] <wasp_ems> stalefries, a new ink
[02:41] <khaije1> Kingsqueak: ya, there are def arguments either way, but it probably makes for an easier desktop
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: stick around, I'll see if I can find anything
[02:41] <cmweb> Yeah, itl be esayer on me, and my mom since she is not verry computer inteligent
[02:41] <stalefries> wasp_ems: that's all I know. try cleaning the inkheads
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> khaije1: oh yeah, it's nice and convenient, my habits are from working with Solaris all day
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> I never noticed it did that
[02:42] <cmweb> Kingsqueak, Do you know how to configure FireStarter?
[02:43] <kmkmeka> ok thank kingsqueak
[02:43] <jonathan__> helo
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: just run it? it's a GUI
[02:43] <stalefries> hi
[02:43] <cmweb> No i need help on cinfiguring it for internet shaare
[02:44] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: well all you need to figure out is what port and protocol you need to open, look at /etc/services for some ideas
[02:44] <cmweb> 192.168.0.2 << is that a good low port?
[02:44] <jonathan__> I've been having some font problems: if i run something like "xmessage hello" for example, i get back things like "Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion"
[02:44] <Litropy> okay, guys. I finished the installaton, rebooted, and was given no choice as to what OS to start in. Instead, OS X booted uninterrupted. Ideas?
[02:44] <LjL> cmweb: that's an IP address, not a port
[02:44] <Cadteach> Anybody use LinNeighborhood?
[02:44] <cmweb> What ever, im too tired to argue
[02:44] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: that's an IP address not a port, look at 'netstat -an' for services running and ports they are on
[02:45] <stalefries> Litropy: you need to tell your Mac to give boot options by pressing some key down, check google, as I din;t know
[02:45] <Litropy> k
[02:45] <jonathan__> it's really annoying when i want to look at something i've done in latex from vim
[02:45] <rioghal> cmeme, examples of ports are: 6667 - IRC, 995, pop (email), 80 - apache, etc.
[02:46] <cmweb> I know whaat dang ports aare, port 80 for web port 21 for ftp port 25 for pop
[02:46] <stalefries> 25 -smtp
[02:46] <Compy> In dapper-drake server has anyone successfully got the adaptec 8130 SATA raid controller drivers working?
[02:46] <cmweb> >:o
[02:47] <rioghal> cmweb> 192.168.0.2 << is that a good low port?  <--- yeah, you must be tired
[02:47] <stalefries> cmweb, :)
[02:47] <LjL> cmweb: then what on earth makes you ask whether 192.168.0.2 is a "good" "low" "port"? an IP address isn't "good", and it makes no sense to call it "low"
[02:47] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: no luck, sorry, nobody seems to mention the chipset/module needed
[02:47] <cmweb> i need some sleep ive been up sence 3 last night
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: go get some, playing on a system when you get ragged is how to break things ;-)
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> cmweb: not that I've ever done that
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> heh
[02:48] <cmweb> kingsqueak, i bet
[02:48] <rioghal> kingrayray, been there, done that, lol

[02:49] <kmkmeka> i just cant get that why did it work on the older version daper
[02:49] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: does 'lspci' show anything that would indicate the card/chipset for it?
[02:49] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: or 'lspcmcia'
[02:49] <cmweb> one last thing before i hit the sac, the program tells me to make sure my internet connection is active which it is this is aperaing only when useing dhcp

[02:54] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: yeah sorry, sort of out of guesses there
[02:54] <lin_christy> Kingsqueak, tried that :(
[02:55] <BlackRazor> Hey all....someone help please. Wanna change GRUB to make XP start by default
[02:55] <Kingsqueak> lin_christy: weird on mine it's  View -> Main Toolbar
[02:55] <kmkmeka> its ok
[02:55] <stalefries> !grub
[02:55] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:55] <jrib> BlackRazor: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst  and set the correct value for "default"
[02:55] <kmkmeka> thank you for your help though
[02:55] <rioghal> lin_christy, you might check in gconf, run gconf-editor and go to apps/nautilus/preferences and have a look there
[02:56] <Kingsqueak> kmkmeka: no problem
[02:56] <Jordan_U> Can anybody confirm that the windows instructions are correct or walk me through them ( I don't normally use windows so I may have made a mistake )
[02:56] <kmkmeka> i guess i just have to drag around my usb card reader
[02:56] <lin_christy> Nautilus 2.16.1?
[02:56] <BlackRazor> lemme check that out jrib...brb
[02:56] <Kingsqueak> lin_christy: also View -> Reset to Defaults   ...that didn't fix it?
[02:56] <lin_christy> nope tried that.. im gonna try running gconf
[02:56] <Kingsqueak> yeah 2.16.1
[02:56] <jrib> BlackRazor: i'm not sure if the comments explain how to count, so let me know if you need an explanation
[02:57] <lin_christy> nothing in gconf-editor that would change this
[02:57] <stalefries> lin_christy: try changing something in gconf to kick it into action, just as a wild try
[02:58] <BlackRazor> ok jrib
[02:58] <jrib> lin_christy: you don't have "main toolbar" as an option in yoru "view" menu?
[02:58] <Compy> hmm, im on dapper drake and uname -a says im running kernel 2.6.15-26-server, yet apt-cache search kernel-source yields 2.4.27.. where can I get *my* installation's kernel source?
[02:58] <BlackRazor> a little hand holding please...ive been using linux for like a week only
[02:58] <lin_christy> jrib, nope its not there
[02:58] <Kingsqueak> anyone else running Fluxbox on Edgy via gdm/xdm login session?
[02:58] <joaquin_> hell
[02:58] <BlackRazor> jrib, im in there what line am I looking to change
[02:58] <jrib> lin_christy: do you have the others: side pane, location, statusbar?
[02:59] <joaquin_> I have a proble with video
[02:59] <jrib> BlackRazor: there is one that starts with "default"
[02:59] <rioghal> Kingsqueak, i did for a long while, whats up?
[02:59] <Kingsqueak> what does  'ps aux | grep startfluxbox | wc'  output if anyone is?  it's started 4 times on my system, and it doesn't seem right
[02:59] <stalefries> jrib, BlackRazor, maybe you should both go to ubuntu-classroom to sort out this issue of Black's?
[02:59] <joaquin_> COULD NOT OPEN /DEV/VIDEO0
[02:59] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: I suspect some g* or dbus something doing somethign odd with the way it's started up
[02:59] <lin_christy> jrib, nope.. just reload.. resetr view.. arrange items... zoom in.. view as list
[02:59] <jrib> BlackRazor: if you wish to join me in #ubuntu-classroom I can help you in more detail, thanks stalefries
[03:00] <lin_christy> how could that be missing?
[03:00] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: meaning some recursion somewhere in saved sessions

[03:01] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: having odd transparency issues, meaning it will only do pseudo when it should just work with my setup and I think it's these odd concurrent sessions
[03:01] <joaquin_> I try with severals softwares but all of them give me same error
[03:01] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: will take a look

[03:09] <Jordan_U> joaquin_, What is the exact model?
[03:09] <joaquin_> DCE310
[03:09] <Jordan_U> morten, look at your partitions in gparted.
[03:10] <morten_> Jordan_U: CLI?
[03:10] <joaquin_> I try installing the spa5Xxx

[03:11] <Jordan_U> morten, mount might tell you, I am stuck in windows right now so I can't really help with specifics right now :(
[03:11] <morten_> it's still in there even if it isn't mounted
[03:11] <morten_> <- L
[03:11] <morten_> mount doesn't tell you. but fstab does.
[03:11] <Falstius> how can I extract the audio from an avi file as a .wav?
[03:11] <dead1ock> no
[03:12] <Skwid_> wow
[03:12] <Skwid_> beryl is mind-blowing
[03:12] <jfm3> morten_: I wonder how you do it if you've done 'swapon /foo/bar'
[03:12] <morten_> what?
[03:13] <Jordan_U> Skwid_, Have you tried ctrl + alt plus clicking and dragging the mouse yet ( in beryl ) it will blow your mind :)
[03:13] <Skwid_> moving the cube ? yeah
[03:13] <Skwid_> its sweet
[03:14] <Redache> Oddly I always found Beryl a bit akward for me to use
[03:14] <Litropy> Okay, guys - my OS X bootloader is just hanging after it detects my osx partition and my linux partition (I get a wait cursor). Is there any way I can replace that with yaboot?
[03:14] <Redache> Either that or I'm just too picky with Themes
[03:14] <Skwid_> my screen is now inverted :)
[03:14] <Jordan_U> Skwid_, Also, for useless fun try changing the spring values in the wobbly windows preferences.
[03:15] <Skwid_> i'll never remember half those controls tho
[03:15] <Litropy> rather, what's the easiest way to install and set up yaboot?
[03:16] <Litropy> I mean this is a bootloader and I don't know much about setting one up... can I just apt-get install yaboot?
=== Sonicvana is now known as Sonic|Laptop
[03:16] <Litropy> an dit be automatic?
[03:17] <Litropy> I just need to get to the point where all I have to do is edit etc/yaboot.conf
[03:17] <Litropy> which, oddly enough isn't there... I though ubuntu installed yaboot?
[03:19] <kitche> Litropy: you using the PPC version?
[03:19] <Litropy> yes.
[03:19] <Lam_> lmfao
[03:19] <Lam_> whoops! wrong channel :D
[03:21] <Jordan_U> Litropy, I have some experience with PPC Ubuntu but I havn't been paying attention, what is the problem?
[03:22] <bimberi> Litropy: Some promising info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot
[03:22] <Litropy> Well, I'm currently running ubuntu from CD. If I were to restart and not hold anything down, I would just boot into os x, uninterrupted. No loading of yaboot or anything
[03:22] <Litropy> If I were to hold down option
[03:23] <lllloo> hi guys
[03:23] <Litropy> I'd get the bootloader made by apple
[03:23] <sardopsycho> anyone familiar with problems with a harddrive not being mounted by the system - shows up under 'computer' but when you click on it it says Unable to mount volume???
[03:23] <lllloo> im baffled by what my pc is doing
[03:23] <lllloo> everything was fine yesterday
[03:23] <Litropy> which detects and shows my os x partition, and my linux partition
[03:23] <lllloo> today it hit the drain
[03:23] <Litropy> but I can't select it because I constantly have a wait cursor
[03:23] <lllloo> it takes super LOng to open things
[03:24] <lllloo> in the boot up
[03:24] <Litropy> so I'd just like to install yaboot and have it load upon start, just like when I installed Yellow Dog
[03:24] <lllloo> the Nautilus logo just sits for a while
[03:24] <lllloo> then goes along towards the desktop
[03:24] <Litropy> bimberi: checking your link
[03:25] <Redache> lllloo on your Grub boot menu there should be a link for "Ubuntu Memtest etc."
[03:25] <Redache> Try that and see if it comes up with anything
[03:25] <Redache> This takes a while
[03:25] <Redache> so a much quicker option would be to open the Gnome System applet
[03:25] <Jordan_> Litropy, Why are you installing yaboot manually, the Ubuntu installer should have delt with that?
[03:26] <lllloo> k
[03:26] <lllloo> so a mem check
[03:26] <Redache> Which you can install by clicking on your desktop taskbars - Add To Panel - System Panel
[03:26] <lllloo> i was thinking about that
[03:26] <Redache> Do the System Monitor first
[03:26] <lllloo> at first i was thinking maybe one of my NIC cards went bad
[03:26] <Redache> Check to see if there's a process that is raping Ram
[03:27] <lllloo> because i have bonding on
[03:27] <Redache> Have you tried disabling your suspected NIC and seeing what happens?
[03:27] <lllloo> yeah i took it out
[03:27] <lllloo> still same thing
[03:28] <lllloo> and i put the standard one on automatic detection
[03:28] <Redache> Try System Monitor and look at the processes runing
[03:28] <rad|x> hi, does anyone know how to fix "make[1] : *** No rule to make target `arch/i386/kernel/msr.c', needed by `arch/i386/kernel/msr.o'. Stop." when i am building a module?
[03:28] <rad|x> please people :P

=== lastnode_ is now known as lastnode
[03:28] <lllloo> no power drainer in the monitor
[03:28] <lllloo> its really odd
[03:28] <Redache> hmm
[03:28] <lllloo> maybe hardrive?
[03:28] <Redache> What make is your hard drive?
[03:29] <lllloo> WD
[03:29] <Redache> Go to their site and give the Diagnostic  tool a go
[03:29] <lllloo> yeah
[03:29] <Redache> Can't remember what the WD one is but it should be there
[03:29] <Redache> If it's hard drive
[03:29] <Litropy> okay, following the article. Rebooting
[03:29] <Redache> Panfull
[03:29] <Litropy> and resetting pram
[03:29] <lllloo> for examle going into MY computer
[03:29] <Litropy> be back
[03:29] <lllloo> takes about
[03:29] <lllloo> 10 secs
[03:29] <jrib> well another option would be to use freenx on that computer and just login to your own computer
[03:30] <lllloo> iight ill check the mem out
[03:30] <lllloo> thanks folk
[03:30] <Redache> Is Windows on the same hard Disk as your Linux install?
[03:30] <lllloo> any tools in UBUNTU to scan a hardrive for errors
[03:30] <lllloo> ?
[03:30] <lllloo> nah
[03:30] <lllloo> separate
[03:30] <lllloo> its a 40gig
[03:30] <Compy> On dapper systems, some of my sata drives get "failed to set xfermode, disabled" in dmesg and bootup, any fixes to this yet? (2.6.15 kernel)

[03:30] <LDZ420> is there a way to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu w/ apt-get?
[03:31] <lastnode> LDZ420, synaptic
[03:31] <Redache> Download the WD diagnostic tools and just try them

[03:40] <jrib> v3xtr1: no, not necessarily
[03:40] <archangelpetro> oh jrib it appears the multiverse that i have are backports
[03:40] <jrib> archangelpetro: right, you want edgy multiverse.  Then you should be able to see java
[03:40] <v3xtr1> I have an icon set currently in use, they were installed and everything, but they didn't make a folder like the others had.

[03:41] <v3xtr1> Thank you very much jrib.  I found them.  :)

[03:43] <v3xtr1> Gah, but how do I change the trash bin icon to the one in the theme?  It has one, but it doesn't change correctly.
[03:43] <Jordan_U> Lam_, You could try to find the module that deals with your sensor and rmmod it.
[03:44] <jrib> v3xtr1: right now you are using theme A, and you want to edit the icon to a custom one?
[03:44] <Lam_> Jordan_U: i'm trying that right now as a matter of fact. it's hard since most of the modules seem foreign
[03:44] <v3xtr1> Yes.  Every icon works except for the trash can.
[03:44] <v3xtr1> but in .icons/mytheme, there is a trash can icon there.
[03:45] <v3xtr1> With both empty and full trash can icons.  But even upon removing and adding the trash bin to my taskbar, it won't change.

[03:47] <ChazZTheSpazZ> can someone help me for a min?
[03:47] <simeon> have just read about playing midi files on ubuntu and have not found a good comment for a great midi player for the ubuntu.
[03:47] <archangelpetro> ChazZTheSpazZ, just ask the question dude :)
[03:48] <rioghal> ChazZTheSpazZ, we can try, whats up?
[03:48] <simeon> Anyone has good experience with a great midi player for ubuntu?
[03:48] <jrib> v3xtr1: well it would help debug your problem, you could compare index.theme or location of the icon, maybe name of the icon, etc.
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: found some of the troubles, thanks, ssh-agent was spawning twice among other issues
[03:48] <ChazZTheSpazZ> i need to know where to put all the new templates and extra stuff i just downloaded for openoffice
[03:48] <rc-1> whats a "zombie" process
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> rioghal: it was a mess of /etc/X11/Xsession.d/* file issues and other things, probably due to my having upgraded rather than doing a clean install
[03:48] <v3xtr1> Hmm, none of the default themes even seem to change the trash icon.  That's weird.
[03:49] <ozoneco> done, ty...new software on the way
[03:49] <jrib> rc-1: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=what%20is%20a%20%22zombie%20process%22
[03:49] <rioghal> kingrayray, oh, ok, glad you got it sorted. you use ssh-agent at all?
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> sure
[03:49] <rc-1>  thanks
[03:49] <rioghal> kingrayray, ok, i dont and i learned how to disable it, was just going to share that knowledge
[03:50] <zippy> ??
[03:50] <Kingsqueak> yeah saw where that is and where dbus is enabled too, not sure I need dbus though
[03:50] <jrib> v3xtr1: it's possible the panel applet doesn't use the theme icon, have you checked if the trash on your desktop changes icon?
[03:50] <v3xtr1> I think you're exactly right.
[03:50] <zippy> any1 else?
[03:51] <v3xtr1> I don't have a trash bin on my desktop.  I think I removed it.  :(
[03:51] <nypr> i have my linux box hookedup with samba and whati want to do is access my other linux box from thisone using just terminal i am outside my network right now using putty and i need to backup files etc. how do i mount the drive so i can access it using a termal?
[03:51] <jrib> !icons | v3xtr1
[03:51] <ubotu> v3xtr1: Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[03:51] <rioghal> jrib, wow, didnt know about that factoid, sure saves typing
[03:52] <khaije1> anyone ever heard of virtualGL ?
[03:52] <v3xtr1> You were exactly right jrib.  On the desktop the icon is what it should be.
[03:52] <v3xtr1> So it must be that the applet doesn't go along with the theme.
[03:53] <ChazZTheSpazZ> -_- I went unnoticed...
[03:53] <jrib> v3xtr1: yeah, so now you should see if there is any documentation for the panel applet, or figure out what icon it is using
[03:53] <kjm> Hey there; I'm using edgy + XGL with Beryl - there is this annoying bug - where hitting shift + backspace at the same time is crashing X - is there a workaround?
[03:53] <simeon> exit
[03:53] <v3xtr1> All righty, I will figure that out on my own.  Thank you very much for your time and help jrib.
[03:53] <rioghal> ChazZTheSpazZ, not unnoticed, its just that maybe no one here knows at this time :)
[03:53] <tonyyserver> ChazZTheSpazZ: Not necessarily unnoticed - most likely it's just that nobody knows right now

[03:53] <nypr> i have my linux box hookedup with samba and whati want to do is access my other linux box from thisone using just terminal i am outside my network right now using putty and i need to backup files etc. how do i mount the drive so i can access it using a termal?
[03:53] <ChazZTheSpazZ> ah, i see...

[03:54] <Jordan_> ChazZTheSpazZ, Is there a chance that the template / extas pack is available in the Ubuntu repositories?
[03:55] <Glombool> Anyone know of a good tutorial for compiling source code in Ubuntu?
[03:55] <ChazZTheSpazZ> the instructions didn't come with it, i already checked that
[03:55] <kjm> Glombool : to install a package, or compile your own code?
[03:55] <rioghal> ChazZTheSpazZ, i went into Tools -> Options (Oo.o writer) and clicked on Paths in the options window and i see several paths including a Templates path. tried that?

[03:55] <ubotu> Glombool: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)

[03:56] <Glombool> kjm I want to download the latest cinelerra code and compile it.
[03:56] <kjm> Glombool - ^^ what ubotu says - and yes, the same old configure, make make install routine will work.
[03:56] <bimberi> Glombool: basically - although using checkinstall instead of 'make install' is a good idea
[03:56] <Jordan_> kjm, Yes, that is a common issue, the solution is in the beryl forums somewhere..
[03:56] <bimberi> !checkinstall
[03:56] <ubotu> checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[03:56] <ChazZTheSpazZ> i don't know if it's in the ubuntu repositories though, i downloaded it off sourceforge through Sun's site
[03:56] <Glombool> bimberi thanks

[04:10] <Joe_CoT> jrib: yes, but that doesn't mean it'll work for you. it varies wildly based on hardware

[04:11] <Joe_CoT> daualagio: have you tried using a boot floppy?
[04:11] <LjL> cmweb: then your installation has a problem. and as for the "sudoing everything" thing, just type "sudo -i" and you'll be root permanently
[04:11] <ozoneco> are the details of an install somewhere in a log?
[04:11] <polpak> cmweb: why not fix the problem giving you the error, then trying to compound it by enabling your root accout

[04:12] <morten_> hm. so it might not work on my hardware?
[04:12] <LjL> cmweb: we're hard because you're making the wrong questions. if you get an error, say "i get this error", don't jump to some conclusions of your own and decide that, somehow, you need to enable the root account
[04:12] <LjL> cmweb: i said *from recovery mode*

=== Deaigo247 is now known as Deaigo
[04:31] <Wiseguy> ryan__, there is a drop down box that lets you change the active interface... make sure you choose the wireless adapter from the drop down menu box
[04:31] <Wiseguy> amicrawle, what do you mean you checked? and DRM isnt the only form of dvd protection
[04:32] <cmweb> ljl, thats a first, the php is working
[04:32] <lllloo> everything was fine until i started my pc this afternoon all of a sudden it takes a while to get thru the login manager after the login..then the UBUNTU splash stays on the desktop for some time..after it goes off it takes about 10 secs or more to open applications. i reinstalled UBUNTU still acted the same .. after that even did a backup restore that i had..
[04:32] <lllloo> still acts the same
[04:32] <Wiseguy> i can burn a dvd with my own protection on it that will prevent you from dd'ing it with very little work... doesnt mean it conforms to DRM standards
[04:32] <lllloo> i did MEm tests and in windows ran a HD diagnostic tool for the HD
[04:32] <lllloo> no probs

[04:33] <lllloo> u blame the video card drivers?
[04:34] <ryan__> Wiseguy: yeah, i can get the wireless to work in the standard gnome connection thing, but i downloaded the network-manager and it does not show a wireless connection

[04:42] <knix> Is there a way to make Gnome recognize Super_L as a modifier key, so I can set keybinds like <Super>1, right now if I hit super it simply recognizes it as a key and enters it as the shortcut
[04:42] <axisys> jbroome: probably.. or old battery :P
[04:42] <Pelo> iter, doesn't work , tried it several times
[04:42] <zcat[1] > not bad for a guess.... yes, you can use print chr() in python..
[04:42] <iter> Pelo: huh, I just tested it with putty
[04:43] <iter> Pelo: in bash that is
[04:43] <SperMite> what should i do with this message : Configuration file `/etc/qt3/qt_plugins_3.3rc' , here are my options ( http://dpaste.com/3106/)

[04:44] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell the_Grinch about ntfs | the_Grinch, you have a private message from Ubotu
[04:44] <DanaG> Under alt / win behavior.
[04:44] <Paradox-Ubuntu> Can I access NTFS drives with Ubuntu?
[04:44] <zcat[1] > lllloo: I'd suggest liberal use of top and/or strace ...
[04:44] <DanaG> You'll want "windows key is super"
[04:44] <Pelo> DanaG,   goto synaptic and install  ntfs-3g,  use that to mount the ntfs drive
[04:44] <lllloo> ?
[04:44] <Pelo> Paradox-Ubuntu,  read what I just told DanaG
[04:44] <DanaG> er, tab-complete screwup?

[04:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rmvb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:45] <knix> DanaG: I've looked, I don't see anything that looks what I want
[04:45] <valehru_server> Anyone know how I can play rmvb files in linux?
[04:45] <ArrenLex> valehru: what are rmvb files?
[04:45] <valehru_server> with xfmedia I can hear sound but no video for rmvb movies
[04:45] <Paradox-Ubuntu> Thanks Pelo
[04:45] <iter> Pelo: have you tried ctrl-left shift
[04:46] <valehru_server> ArrenLex, its a type of media file, real player i think...but real doesnt show the video or the audio of the file....real popular in china.
[04:46] <Pelo> iter,  don'T worry about it
[04:46] <DanaG> system -- preferences -- keyboard -- keyboard layout -- "alt/win key behavior"
[04:46] <cmweb> Does any one know the base password aand user for Mysql, and how i change it..
[04:47] <ArrenLex> valehru_server: the wikipedia entry, if you'd cared to look properly, lists several media players which support them.
[04:47] <knix> DanaG: odd, I had to do "Super is mapped to the Win-keys (default)." I figured since it said "default" I didn't have to set it
[04:47] <Pelo> cmweb,   try admin/admin , admin/blank,  blank/admin,  blank/blank
[04:47] <knix> DanaG: thanks :)
[04:47] <DanaG> I think that's odd, too.
[04:47] <valehru_server> ArrenLex, I know several media players that claim to support them...but they don't seem to support them out of the box.
[04:47] <knix> hehe
[04:47] <cmweb> k
[04:47] <stalefries> cmweb: maybe your user/pass?
[04:48] <cmweb> I just installed it
[04:48] <zcat[1] > I need to clean this windows logo off and find a nice Tux decal for the key. Anyone know a good way to remove it?
[04:48] <ArrenLex> valehru_server: I'm not surprised they would, since you need binary codecs to view these files, as there are no open-source codecs for rmvb, like most propietary formats.
[04:48] <cmweb> gish dern, i dont got phpmyadamin installed
[04:48] <ArrenLex> valehru: I suggest mplayer with w32codecs.
[04:49] <stalefries> zcat: Goo-gone
[04:49] <stalefries> zcat: also chec out system76's free ubuntu decals
[04:49] <zcat[1] > never heard of it :(

[05:00] <rad|x> mister_roboto: yes i have it at /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/msr.c
[05:00] <stalefries> paradox34690: to fnd out the real name
[05:00] <Pelo> DanaG,  which version of acad was it ?
[05:00] <DanaG> I'd give it to somebody I knew personally, b efore anything else.
[05:00] <paradox34690> yeah yeah yeah... hold on...

[05:01] <lowchi> anyone good with getting sound to work on a new ubuntu box?
[05:01] <stalefries> !sound
[05:01] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

[05:02] <stalefries> Healot: what??
[05:02] <Pelo> lowchi,  be patient someone one will be around eventualy thaty can help you ,  if not , try looking up your problem and error msg in the forum
[05:02] <rad|x> i have no idea how to fix this

[05:02] <paradox34690> there ya go
[05:02] <paradox34690> it's decent
[05:03] <mister_roboto> rad|x: and what does "ls -l /usr/src/linux" show?
[05:03] <paradox34690> plays streams... so that's at least a good sign :)
[05:03] <DanaG> hah, my sound card makes suspend2 not work.
[05:03] <paradox34690> now it's my turn for the question...
[05:03] <cmweb> Can some one give me a code to make aa database called zpaanel
[05:03] <DanaG> damn emu10k1.
[05:03] <cmweb> zpanel*
[05:03] <rad|x> /usr/src/linux -> /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17
[05:03] <Pelo> cmweb,  look it up in synaptic
[05:04] <cmweb> pelo, what....
[05:04] <DisabledDuck> on the live CD, is there anyway to format a drive without isntalling Ubuntu?
[05:04] <paradox34690> I have a .SVG file (start-here.svg) that's part of a gtk2.x theme pack... I'm a little confused by the instructions on how to get this icon to be the 'start' button... anyone familiar with this?
[05:04] <cmweb> synaptic is for downloading packages not an information book
[05:04] <Pelo> cmweb,  system > admin > synaptic,  search  zpanel
[05:04] <paradox34690> Disabled Duck: No.
[05:04] <stalefries> cmweb, you want to make a mysql database?
[05:04] <cmweb> Yes
[05:04] <stalefries> hmm
[05:04] <paradox34690> perhaps then?
[05:04] <stalefries> !mysql
[05:04] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[05:05] <jrib> DisabledDuck: use gparted
[05:05] <stalefries> bah, not much help
[05:05] <JamieBE> Anyone know where I can get hold of a whole archive of launcher icons for Ubuntu?
[05:05] <JamieBE> !icons
[05:05] <ubotu> Want to see volume/trash icons on the desktop? Go to /apps/nautilus/desktop in gconf-editor (Gnome) or go to http://kudos.berlios.de/kf/kisimlar/tipsntrix.html#showtrash (KDE)
[05:05] <mister_roboto> i'm not sure what you're trying to compile but it's probably  trying to find a dir called "/usr/src/linux-`uname -r`" or something like that. it doesn't match your running kernel
[05:05] <stalefries> JamieBE: what do you mean by icons?
[05:05] <rad|x> ahh
[05:05] <rad|x> 'll try that
[05:05] <rad|x> i am trying to compile a simple module
[05:05] <JamieBE> I know they are called "pixmaps" - but that's about it.
[05:05] <Pelo> JamieBE, /usr/share/icons,,  or ... /pixelmap
[05:05] <rad|x> its basically a module example
[05:05] <pdavid> anyone else in north america feeling some weird congestion resolving dns?
[05:06] <rad|x> and i get that error
[05:06] <stalefries> JamieBE: you could try art.gnome.org, gnome-look.org, kde-look.org
[05:06] <cmweb> any one...
[05:06] <stalefries> Pelo, it's /usr/share/pixmaps
[05:06] <Pelo> JamieBE,  or  use the search feature and look for *.png
[05:06] <JamieBE> stalefries, will try that.
[05:06] <stalefries> and/or icons
[05:06] <zcat[1] > woot, it works. Doesn't play nice with beryl though :(
[05:06] <stalefries> zcat[1] : what works?
[05:06] <zcat[1] > tvout
[05:06] <stalefries> cool
[05:06] <paradox34690> How can I make a .SVG file my "start" button?
[05:07] <cmweb> Can somone give me a code to create a mysql daatabase?
[05:07] <stalefries> paradox34690: Start button?
[05:07] <stalefries> usp?
[05:07] <paradox34690> stalefries, okay, maybe not the best word to use, but it's the only one I could think of..
[05:07] <Pelo> stalefries,  I think he mean the application menu icon ( he wants to replace the ubuntu logo)
[05:07] <stalefries> The main menu?
[05:07] <stalefries> ah
[05:08] <paradox34690> Pelo, you would be correct!
[05:08] <paradox34690> :)
[05:08] <stalefries> hmm, that's distributor-logo in whatever icon theme you use
[05:08] <JamieBE> Ahhh - Pelo, Stalefries: Sorry, I forgot to mention, it isn't theme/style icons I am looking for, just a general icon bundle.
[05:08] <paradox34690> hmmmm
[05:08] <YokoZar> Can someone make me an account for the Ubuntuguide.org wiki?
[05:08] <stalefries> JamieBE: those websites are good for general themes
[05:08] <DanaG> Oh, also, I can't get WPA to work with my ipw3945.
[05:09] <stalefries> JamieBE: especially art.gnome.org
[05:09] <paradox34690> hahaha, no... i'm new to linux... only been using it for about a week...
[05:09] <paradox34690> what I DO need is a good stiff drink
[05:09] <Pelo> JamieBE,  look further in,  you have appications icons within the themes you can use and pixmap is just a bunch of  random icons
[05:09] <zcat[1] > paradox34690: I think you change it in gconf.. I changed mine, but that was a while ago and I forget how I did it...
[05:09] <nomasteryoda> JamieBE, you can add the gnome-art menu item and just add the things you want with it..
[05:09] <nomasteryoda> it uses those sites
[05:09] <paradox34690> okay... i'll search around, thanks guys!

[05:10] <livingtm_> I just upgraded to Edgy. When all was said and done I had a new kernel installed. 2.6.17, for which there appears to be no image with SMP. Is there really no SMP kernel image for edgy???
[05:10] <Pelo> paradox34690,  http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84
[05:10] <paradox34690> cmweb, 5 grand... probably :)
[05:10] <Pelo> and paradox34690  I don't think you can change the icon you want to change
[05:10] <stalefries> cmweb: big enough
[05:11] <cmweb> I thought they would just take the pc away
[05:11] <zcat[1] > Pelo: yes you can, if it's the ubuntu logo on the menu. Cos I did
[05:11] <stalefries> Pelo: he can
[05:11] <stalefries> Pelo: there have been howtos about it

[05:12] <Pelo> cmweb,  you are bordering on spam
[05:12] <stalefries> cmweb: I would try google

[05:13] <cmweb> thanks for the warning pelo
[05:13] <mister_roboto> cmweb: did you look at any tutorials?
[05:13] <paradox34690> i dunno...  if you go to gnome-look.org, i'm downloading the Wii-Black-theme-pack... i already installed the tarball, and extracted the .svg file... it's got something in there about where to copy it too (sorry, i'd copy & paste, but I deleted it already) :)
[05:13] <stalefries> paradox34690: try the ubuntuforums.org, there's howtos about it
[05:14] <stalefries> probably even scripts
[05:14] <lowchi> i checked all my sound manger ASAL's and they are on? anyone know any other tricks for getting sound to work? like a driver through Automatix or something?
[05:14] <mister_roboto> cmweb: i guess that means no :)
[05:14] <paradox34690> I'll figure it out eventually... either by reading or by people like you guys... (or my personal fav, dumb luck)
[05:15] <stalefries> lowchi: Try unmuting everything?
[05:15] <cmweb> That guy is know for this

[05:18] <Kingsqueak> theSSzoner: any Cialis for sale?
[05:18] <paradox34690> uh... iain, everything is ASCII... more than likely, hold down the alt-key and do key combinations of 0-255...
[05:18] <ecoblue> Hello, I need help getting my Broadcom Wireless chip to work.
[05:18] <pkh_> I'm ssh'ing between an edgy client and dapper server with x11 forwarding on at both ends.  xclock comes up find on the client machine, but not firefox -- anone know why?
[05:18] <ecoblue> It just dissapeared from the network manager as a device
[05:18] <pkh_> p.s. firefox just seems to hang at the commandline...
[05:19] <zcat[1] > 'cos ff does weird stuff..
[05:19] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: you wait a good while, it's sloooow to export generally
[05:19] <iain> paradox34690: Only 128 characters are ascii.  There are at least thousands, so not everything is ASCII.
[05:19] <pkh_> zcat[1] , Kingsqueak : is there another lighter browser that I should use instead?
[05:19] <iain> Euphidime: is this hexadecimal or decimal?  I can't get anything.
[05:19] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: is this on your local network?
[05:20] <stalefries> theSSzoner: don't spam, please
[05:20] <Kingsqueak> zcat[1] : lol
[05:20] <mister_roboto> pkh_: konqueror?
[05:20] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, no, reasonably fast uni network though
[05:20] <jbroome> spam, and he's using mirc.  ugh. :P
[05:20] <paradox34690> um... iain, okay... i'll let you believe that... i used to teach tech classes...  There is only 255 ascii characters...
[05:20] <Pelo> lain  I was never able to get that to work either, if you figure it out let me know,  alt-left + code never worked for me either
[05:21] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: yeah, it's slow to export, it could also be the script that starts it as well, I use opera when I have to export a browser because it works a bit quicker than most I've tried
[05:21] <bhudda> Pelo , under what subdirectory did you see that?

[05:21] <paradox34690> i know it DOES work on a windows box...
[05:21] <mister_roboto> paradox34690: ascii is only 0x00 = 0x7f
[05:21] <jbroome> thank you sir
[05:22] <ChromePrime> is this an appropriate room for tech help?

[05:22] <bhudda> Pelo where was it?
[05:22] <Pelo> bhudda,  just do a search for  cpu fan

[05:22] <zcat[1] > we got him well trained ;)
[05:23] <ChromePrime> is anyone familiar with connection bridging?
[05:23] <mister_roboto> paradox34690: informally calling the "upper" ascii characters "ascii" doesn't change the meaning
[05:23] <paradox34690> and it's incomplete... shit.
[05:23] <paradox34690> :)
[05:23] <mister_roboto> paradox34690: google "define:ascii"
[05:23] <ChromePrime> there is almost nothing in the forums
[05:23] <Pelo> paradox34690,   the problem is some of us can'T get the ascii char to work in ubu
[05:23] <craigo> can i connect to the net if i just load the cd and dont install?
[05:23] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, works like a dream, thanks!
[05:23] <zcat[1] > iain: cats are damn smart :)
[05:23] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: cool
[05:23] <ChromePrime> a pointer in the right direction would be a huge help
[05:23] <stalefries> craigo: yes
[05:23] <stalefries> craigo: if it works :)
[05:24] <Pelo> craigo,  yes but you will loose your settings when you turn off
[05:24] <paradox34690> i can't either... Pelo... is it possible that it's a setting or (more likely) a different key combination in Ubu that needs to be pressed?
[05:24] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, bugger, doesn't show up the advanced menu!  is there another one I can try?
=== Asc is now known as d573a6
[05:24] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: not sure how new you are etc. but another tip is to setup ssh port forwarding to tunnel from localhost to that device with your local browser
[05:24] <Pelo> paradox34690,  I've been looking for it for 6 months , haven't found it yet
[05:24] <iain> It's not that I can't type ASCII characters.  Non-ASCII characters are what give me grief.
[05:24] <ChromePrime> is it possible to bridge my usb wireless connection with my ethernet card?
[05:25] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, :) I know, but couldn't be bothered...  will try that now :)
[05:25] <ChromePrime> it a cinch under xp, maybe too easy
[05:25] <stalefries> ChromePrime: possble
[05:25] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: as in  ssh you@hop.host -L 8080:router.device.IP:80
[05:25] <danielmarsom> hoe would i install rpms using synaptic?
[05:25] <danielmarsom> *how
[05:25] <paradox34690> iain, you mean 128-255, right?
[05:25] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, that's easy...
[05:25] <Pelo> lain  there is a caracter map in  menu application >`accessories
[05:25] <Agrajag> danielmarsom: you wouldn't, synaptic doesn't use RPM
[05:25] <iain> paradox34690: Those, and higher characters.
[05:26] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: it's also quite fast
[05:26] <JamieBE> Off-topic question: Is it worth switching from Dapper to Edgy?
[05:26] <danielmarsom> oh how would i do it with apt then?
[05:26] <Agrajag> in fact unless you have a real good reason, you shouldn't be using RPMs at all
[05:26] <iain> Pelo: If we were both in Windows, I'd call that the noob's way
[05:26] <ChromePrime> i need to use my ubuntu pc to feed a live internet signal out of my ethernet card to a switch
[05:26] <Agrajag> danielmarsom: apt doesn't use rpms either
[05:26] <ecoblue> I have a 64bit AMD chip, should I use the 64 bit ubuntu? Last time it was incompatible with lots on version 5
[05:26] <danielmarsom> yeah.. just an experimental thing..
[05:26] <Agrajag> apt is a frontend to dpkg, which uses .deb files
[05:26] <danielmarsom> lots of rpm sites have instructions for apt tho..
[05:26] <Agrajag> as in apt-rpm for fedora/redhat?
[05:26] <ChromePrime> the switch has all of my comps upstairs plugged into it
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: you can also setup ~/.ssh/config to have a Host : foobar   with the forward options so you just ssh you@foobar and it just sets up that tunnel in one step
[05:27] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, I get: ssh you@hop.host -L 8080:router.device.IP:80
[05:27] <pkh_> no i don't...
[05:27] <pkh_> I get: bind: Cannot assign requested address
[05:27] <Pelo> iain,  so would I but I haven'T been able to do better yet, ( not much of a problem currently anyway, I can get by with alt-car  for what I need these days)
[05:27] <ChromePrime> been using to for month w/out probs under xp
[05:27] <pkh_> and then: channel_setup_fwd_listener: cannot listen to port: 8080
[05:27] <ChromePrime> there seems to be no useful info on this in the forums
[05:27] <iain> Pelo: alt-car?
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: well you did sub the correct hostnames in the command right?
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: hmm do you have anything on 8080 right now maybe?
[05:28] <ChromePrime> can anyone tell me where to look?
[05:28] <Pelo> iain,   to the right of the space bar for lower-right char
[05:28] <mister_roboto> Kingsqueak: probably running tomcat or something on 8080 :)
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: try a different high port
[05:28] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, don't think so, but this pc has been worked pretty hard, it's the software testing machine I use...
[05:28] <Pelo> iain,  canadian-french keyboard here,  just a little more stuff on it then a regular us qwerty
[05:28] <henzo> como les vaila cauros, que se teje
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: if you have tomcat or anything like that 8080 is common, try something odder like 9666
[05:28] <foo> What can I use to play .rm (real media) files?
[05:29] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, I tried a few 8081, 9080 -- they all failed in the same way
[05:29] <musaddi> i have installed gentoo using  gentoo 2006.1 minimal cd, (on ATHLON XP + nvidia agp card system). Applications are taking 5-10 seconds to start, what could be the reason?

[05:30] <Skwid_> (i have a bunch of python packages that do not update)
[05:30] <slavik> Beryl is teh ownz0rz
[05:30] <paradox34690> I'm not bro... really...
[05:30] <Pelo> Skwid_,  that there isn't a newer version at the time of the update

[05:31] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, x11forwarding is yes, and works (xclock comes up lcoally when called)  -- but is there another setting for -L options?
[05:31] <paradox34690> I just googled what you told me "define:ascii" and that link I sent you was right there in it...
[05:31] <Skwid_> Pelo: what do you mean ? why do they show up then ?
[05:31] <iain> paradox34690: I'm not talking about ascii though
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: AllowTcpForwarding yes
[05:31] <iain> I'm talking about typing non-ascii characters
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: and GatewayPorts yes
[05:31] <Pelo> Skwid_,  because they are available ?
[05:32] <paradox34690> what do you consider "non-ascii" then?
[05:32] <paradox34690> like...
[05:32] <mister_roboto> paradox34690: oh for christ's sake, dude. the formal definition is 00-7f    believe what you want
[05:32] <Pelo> Skwid_,  sorry , I guess I miss read you ,
[05:32] <Skwid_> Pelo: so are they available or not ?
[05:32] <Pelo> misread
[05:32] <paradox34690> can you give me an example?
[05:32] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: you'll have to restart sshd on hophost if you change them too
[05:32] <Poop> I need help partitioning a drive

[05:32] <ceruleantiger> I'm trying to get my macbook to have two-finger scrolling and all of that stuff, but I can't get it to work. It keeps saying something about synaptics even device not found...
[05:33] <ceruleantiger> I'm a bit of a noob, so sorry if this is a dumb question...
[05:33] <DarkSpirit> How can I check which Hardware is not working properly or has no driver ?
[05:33] <Pelo> iain,  are you sure that is a unicode char  I can'T see it
[05:33] <paradox34690> i see it
[05:33] <paradox34690> diamond with a question mark
[05:33] <iain> Pelo: What do you see? Gibberish? Some IRC clients have trouble understanding each other.
[05:34] <Pelo> iain,   question mark in a lozenge
[05:34] <Pelo> ceruleantiger,  what device ?
[05:34] <slavik> DarkSpirit: what exactly are you checking?
[05:34] <the_Grinch> where is the wine home directory located?
[05:34] <iain> Pelo, paradox34690: There are some unicode chars on this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu
[05:34] <ceruleantiger> Pelo: what do you mean what device?
[05:34] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, no difference -- man says they are on by default anyway...  not sure -- will try another browser on the server side for now and see where that gets me
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: try using -vvv with ssh, see if it's more helpful with output
[05:35] <Pelo> the_Grinch,  what do you mean by  wine home directory ?   /home/username/.wine ?
[05:35] <paradox34690> so how are you producing them through here?
[05:35] <Pelo> ceruleantiger,  are this a mouse ?
[05:35] <specialbuddy> how would I set up fstab to give me ownership and rwx?
[05:35] <Skwid_> Pelo: any idea ?
[05:35] <polpak>   <- is a unicode character

[05:35] <JamieBE> Whats the general census on Linux "Mint" around here?
[05:35] <the_Grinch> well the directions I have say I have to put two files into the wine system directory
[05:35] <Pelo> Skwid_,  sorry no
[05:36] <paradox34690> ew... totally inefficient...
[05:36] <iain> On windows, I'd hold alt and type a number code
[05:36] <ceruleantiger> Pelo: it's a trackpad. I'm trying to do two-finger scrolling, so I need to install "synaptics" or something
[05:36] <dxdemetriou> how can I apply a patch to source directory?
[05:36] <paradox34690> okay, i understand what your wanting then...
[05:36] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, lo was down!  no idea why...
[05:36] <slavik> DarkSpirit: what motherboard?
[05:36] <axisys> jbroome: my wireless mouse is working now.. yeaahh!
[05:36] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, probably something to do with NetworkManager
[05:36] <the_Grinch> so I guess...where is the wine system directory?
[05:36] <pkh_> Kingsqueak, works fine now...
[05:36] <DarkSpirit> Asus P5VDC-X
[05:37] <slavik> what chipset is that?
[05:37] <slavik> model sounds very old ...
[05:37] <Kingsqueak> pkh_: lol yeah that would do it
[05:37] <the_Grinch> found it thanks
[05:37] <paradox34690> the unicode characters that you're using are totally different than the ASCII characters (oh, mister_roboto... show me where it's "Formally 00-7f" cause it'd be new to me)
[05:37] <axisys> jbroome: i had to unscrew the mouse .. clear the joints where it was rusty and now it works

[05:49] <xenex> mmkay
[05:49] <Jordan_U> xenex, Yes.
[05:49] <Ernz> slavik: Nope.
[05:49] <slavik> there will be a text box next to 'Name:', it should say 'eth0' in the text box

[05:50] <tekton> thanks
[05:50] <slavik> then right click the icon and click properties

[05:50] <klick_> http://pastebin.com/829468
[05:51] <Ernz> slavik: A single click shows a comment box "No network devices have been found". Double click does nothing. There is no "Properties" option either.
[05:51] <mister_roboto> xenex: if you already have dapper running in vmware, you can update it to edgy by changing the sources.list.  i did that in vmware and that worked too
[05:52] <sky123> damn ive been at it like two days to figure out why software raid on my sparc box with ubuntu wouldnt work and here is the answer - The first partition at the beginning of the disk cannot be software RAID or LVM. The installer will not offer the options when in manual partitioning mode. Create a 1 MB empty partition at the beginning of the disk and start creating your RAID/LVM partitions from there. This is not a bug but t

[05:53] <monokrome> Because I don't have it, and i'm trying to figure out why.
[05:53] <jbroome> it's in universe
[05:53] <monokrome> Yeah...
[05:53] <xenex> does vmware act like it was actually installed? (i can save things and close vmplayer and go back and open it)
[05:53] <monokrome> weird.
[05:53] <Jordan_U> Klick, It looks like it is just having problems stopping bluemon, since I don't know what bluemon is I don't know if it is safe just to kill it, but you could try setting it not to start up at all then remove it.
[05:54] <slavik> Ernz: weird, open terminal and do 'ifconfig' pastebin the output
[05:54] <mister_roboto> xenex: even better, you can just pause the vm and restart it exactly where you were before :)    and yes, you can install just from the iso only. you capture the iso and it looks like you put a boot cd in the cdrom. then reboot the vm
[05:55] <Jordan_U> Klick, Can you quit bluemon?
[05:55] <xenex> mister_roboto: so it'll act like ubuntu is installed? like i can exit vmware completely, restart my computer, and go back and do whatever like it was actually installed?
[05:56] <mister_roboto> xenex: yes. it's like a whole separate PC running in a window
[05:56] <xenex> cool
[05:56] <Agrajag> xenex: you can either shut down the VM and boot it back up, or you can pause it and start it again from that exact point
[05:56] <Klick> Jordan_U, nope
[05:56] <mister_roboto> xenex: like i said, you can even pause the vm, reboot your whole box and go back into the vm exactly where it was when you paused
[05:56] <slavik> xenex: there is no 3D in such an environment though
[05:56] <xenex> i know that
[05:56] <jared777> how do i change the defualut resolution of xwindows from the recovery console??
[05:56] <tekton> ubuntu will just run like an application in a window.
[05:57] <Jordan_U> jared777, sudo nano /etc/xorg.conf
[05:57] <mister_roboto> xenex: of course it's slower than running full speed on the native hardware, but it's very flexible. a fun way to try out a bunch of os's
[05:57] <jared777> Jordan: I did that but what do I need to change?
[05:58] <mister_roboto> xenex: and you can save the state, try a bunch of crazy stuff, and if you break your install, just restore the vm to the save point
[05:58] <jared777> Jordan: I hooked it up to a TV but the resoultion i had it on before is not compatible I need to change it to 800x600

[06:01] <Jordan_U> jared777, I am not verry good with manually hacking an xorg.conf, if there really isn't anybody who knows how then running this command will do it, it will ask you what driver you want to use and then what resolutions then it will create an entirely new xorg.conf ( after it backs up the old one of course ) : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh

[06:14] <ozoneco> any smoothie users know where bootup logs are?
[06:14] <faranda> ok, thanks
[06:14] <Qwell> xenex: I could send you my ubuntu.vmx..  might help some
[06:14] <faranda> bye

[06:14] <mister_roboto> ozoneco: /var/log/boot
[06:14] <Qwell> xenex: You tell me how big you want the HD to be, and I'll create you one
[06:15] <sumojim> I have a really simple question... How do I tell the terminal what directory a file is in? can I simply use ~/desktop/bcmwl5.inf??? Is that format ocrrect?
[06:15] <xenex> Qwell: nah i already have the 6.10 iso
[06:15] <ozoneco> ty
[06:15] <Qwell> xenex: no, a vmware "image"
[06:15] <corky> who wants to pm me and help?
[06:15] <Qwell> one with no OS installed yet - just an empty one
[06:15] <Qwell> sumojim: ugh...bcm4311?
[06:15] <slide> Anyone know if there is a package available for trac 0.10? Or when it will be available?
[06:15] <sumojim> bcm4306
[06:16] <Qwell> less sucky
[06:16] <Qwell> ..slightly
[06:16] <xenex> Qwell: i don't know. i only need to make a ubuntu vm and convert the icon's to ico for my windows desktop
[06:16] <tom47> is there a menu howto for ubuntu?
[06:16] <tom47> !menu
[06:16] <ubotu> menu: generates programs menu for all menu-aware applications. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1.29 (edgy), package size 379 kB, installed size 1580 kB
[06:17] <mister_roboto> xenex: you can download a pre-built dapper from vmware's site. if you really need edgy, just dist-upgrade it
[06:17] <tom47> !alacarte
[06:17] <xenex> mister_roboto: the dapper is 714mb, no thanks x_x
[06:17] <ubotu> alacarte: easy menu editing. In component main, is optional. Version 0.10.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 73 kB, installed size 1136 kB
[06:17] <gansinho> please I need some help with my bluetooth dongle configuration, as it seems it is not nativelly supported ( it is not in this list http://www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/features.html ) is there any way to bypass this?
[06:17] <TheJoe> try http://ubuntuguide.org
[06:17] <xenex> mister_roboto: are you sure i need vmware server? i can get vmware workstation
[06:17] <TheJoe> menu howto...
[06:18] <Jordan_U> xenex, I have been away, why can't you just install from the iso?
[06:18] <tom47> TheJoe ty
[06:18] <Skwid_> where can i put programs to be launched with my gnome session ?
[06:18] <TheJoe> yup
[06:18] <xenex> Jordan_U: i have vmplayer, and i want to install my own copy of ubuntu
[06:18] <mister_roboto> xenex: i think workstation will work. to be honest, i never used it. used vmware player for a short time then went to vmware server
[06:18] <Jordan_U> Skwid_, System -> Administration -> sessions
[06:18] <sumojim> I'm trying to get my wireless to work... I am looking at a page that has instructions but doesn't explain well what the format for the path is supposed to look like.... Does this look like it could be correct??sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/desktop/bcmwl5.inf
[06:19] <mister_roboto> xenex: vmware server image is only 226 mb
[06:19] <TuTUx> hi all, how come my swap is not active at startup? instead of that every time i have to sudo swapon it, im using edgy
[06:19] <jbroome> xenex: workstation will do that
[06:19] <xenex> mister_roboto: its 145mb
[06:19] <TheJoe> tom47: you might even download a local copy
[06:19] <xenex> jbroome: how sure are you?
[06:19] <Qwell> or, you could let the nice guy who's trying to help you...help you
[06:19] <Qwell> xenex: *cough*
[06:19] <jedilj> i just installed ubuntu and actions like scrolling and dragging are real choppy what to do?
[06:19] <mister_roboto> xenex: i'm dl'ing the ubuntu server image, i mean, not vmware server
[06:19] <DarkSpirit> I got a mouse with 5 buttons, problem is no Linux Drivers for it.
[06:19] <Jordan_U> xenex, So can't you install from the iso in vmware, I don't see the problem?
[06:19] <xenex> i'm so confused -_-
[06:20] <TuTUx> hi all, how come my swap is not active at startup? instead of that every time i have to sudo swapon it, im using edgy...
[06:20] <mister_roboto> Jordan_U: he only has the vmware player. can't create a new image
[06:20] <Qwell> xenex: You just need vmware-workstation to create the actual vmware image
[06:20] <xenex> i have the 6.10 iso, i want to install it as a vm.
[06:20] <xenex> okay
[06:20] <Qwell> once you have an image (which I can create FOR YOU. :p), you can use player
[06:20] <tom47> TheJoe looks like grub menu
[06:20] <DarkSpirit> h
[06:20] <Jordan_U> jedilj, Have you installed the drivers for your video card?
[06:20] <tom47> not much on applications amenu
[06:20] <xenex> Qwell: yeah but how big will the image be?
[06:20] <Qwell> xenex: couple kb maybe
[06:21] <mister_roboto> xenex: why don't you just let qwell do that for you :)   no os will be very small
[06:21] <jedilj> just installed ubuntu and actions like dragging and scrolling are real choppy what to do?
[06:21] <Qwell> 540K    /root/vmware/Ubuntu/
[06:21] <Jordan_U> jedilj, Have you installed the drivers for your video card?
[06:21] <Ernz> !aiglx
[06:21] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[06:21] <TheJoe> tom47: what are you looking for exactly
[06:21] <jedilj> no
[06:21] <Ernz> ...so how do I get it working? :)
[06:21] <xenex> Qwell: go for it i guess
[06:21] <Jordan_U> !fglrx | jedilj
[06:21] <ubotu> jedilj: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:21] <Qwell> xenex: just tell me what HD size you want, and send me a PM with your email or something
[06:22] <tom47> TheJoe i install applications, and they install menu files in /usr/share/menu etc but they do not appear on the menu itself

[06:25] <highnek> Ernz: No, you have to install beryl and kibadock to get that stuff. There's a better video I made http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyiacxtIzYk

=== Deaigo874 is now known as Deaigo
[06:30] <Jordan_U> Trevinho, Just so you know #ubuntu-offtopic is a better place for discussion, and Digg users tend to be grammer Nazis.
[06:30] <sumojim> Oh! I see I forgot Linux was case sensitive!
[06:30] <jrib> meisam: what did they add from 8.1.4 to 8.1.5 out of curiousity?
[06:31] <the_Grinch> anyone know of a newsreader that is like newsrover...meaning allows you to search the newsgroup server to find files?
[06:31] <meisam> nothing that much, im really stuborn
[06:32] <meisam> jbroome it does not work
[06:32] <Jordan_U> meisam, Enable backports and see if it is available there.
[06:32] <meisam> Jordan_U where is it?
[06:33] <Jordan_U> !backports | meisam
[06:33] <ubotu> meisam: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[06:34] <TheGino_Frank> any good websites that have .Deb packages out there besides Debian?
[06:34] <jrib> TheGino_Frank: deb packages for what?
[06:34] <Jordan_U> TheGino_Frank, Isn't that what reops are for?
[06:34] <bimberi> packages.ubuntu.com :)
[06:34] <brlancer> Can someone point me to a howto for network interfaces and module aliases? (wlan0 for wifi, lan0 for wired)
[06:35] <morten_> how can i check if my swap is actually working? it shows up when i cat /proc/swaps, but 0 bytes are in use
[06:36] <Jordan_U> TheGino_Frank, And Debian .debs don't always work in Ubuntu and make make things unstable just so you know.
[06:36] <Jordan_U> *may make
[06:36] <bimberi> morten_: check for a Swap line in the output of 'free'
[06:36] <morten_> bimberi: i've got one. it's the only line there.
[06:37] <jedilj> how do i detect what graphics card i have?
[06:37] <morten_> jedilj: lspci
[06:37] <Jordan_U> jedilj, pastebin the output of lspci
[06:37] <z9999> Can someone provide me with a correct list of commands to execute in ubuntu to ensure the removal of everything that may cause a conflict during a wireless install, followed by the correct order of commands need to install the wireless ? And I have tried, the forum, wikis, FAQ, followed every instruction available and have had no success at all, so I just would like to know for certain what...
[06:37] <z9999> ...commands are necessary to use and will try them using each of the many drivers I have downloaded previously.
[06:37] <TheGino_Frank> Jordan_U, Thats why i asked if there is any good websites other the debian
[06:37] <bimberi> morten_: surely there's "Mem:" and "+/- buffers" as well
[06:37] <morten_> bimberi: does that mean it's definitely working? is there some way i can force a write to swapspace, to test it?
[06:38] <morten_> bimberi: uh. yes. i didn't count those.
[06:38] <morten_> but yes, i do have those as well
[06:38] <bimberi> morten_: ah, kk :)  .  just open lots of programs i guess
[06:38] <mister_roboto> z9999: is this after a dist-upgrade from breezy, by any chance?
[06:38] <the_Grinch> is there a program like NewsRover for Ubuntu?
[06:39] <Jordan_U> TheGino_Frank, Again, Why?
[06:39] <z9999> mister_roboto: No this is a brand new Compaq V3042AU that came with Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 LTS installed.
[06:40] <Jordan_U> z9999, What kind of wireless card is it?
[06:40] <mister_roboto> z9999: ok, just wondering. i was having problems after i dist-upgrade'd from breezy.
[06:40] <TheGino_Frank> Jordan_U, just to look around see if there is anything that the repos dont have or Ubuntu did't approve yet even .Rpm sites l
[06:40] <morten_> bimberi: i have to fill up RAM completely?
[06:41] <Skwid_> flash 9 for linux ! wohooo
[06:41] <corevett1> which linux distribution has the best out of the box wireless support
[06:41] <Jordan_U> corevett1, I would guess knoppix
[06:41] <Skwid_> http://www.digg.com/linux_unix/Flash_Player_9_Update_for_Linux_2
[06:41] <morten_> yea. knoppix is pretty solid
[06:41] <TheGino_Frank> Skwid_, dont use it it junk if you use Youtube
[06:41] <bimberi> morten_: i'm sure linux will use RAM until it has to use swap
[06:41] <z9999> Jordan_U: It uses a Broadcom 4311 chip. We opened the cover to confirm that and there is no other info on the tiny card.
[06:41] <morten_> they've got a fuckton of drivers packaged
[06:42] <Skwid_> TheGino_Frank: ???
[06:42] <morten_> bimberi: hehe. i don't think i have enough apps installed to fill up ram
[06:42] <Luke> does anyone know of a good newsgroup reader besides thunderbird?
[06:42] <Qwell> Luke: pan
[06:42] <Luke> Qwell: gtk2?
[06:42] <Qwell> dunno
[06:42] <bimberi> morten_: :)
[06:42] <Jordan_U> z9999, You can see the exct version of the card by using the device manager or looking at the output of lspci
[06:43] <Qwell> z9999: ugh!
[06:43] <Qwell> z9999: not gonna happen
[06:43] <Luke> Qwell: thanks
[06:43] <Jordan_U> z9999, exct = exact
[06:43] <Qwell> z9999: at least, not with 6.06
[06:43] <TheGino_Frank> Luke, Firefox websites have good news readers for thunderbird and FF
[06:43] <bhudda> can someone tell me what the thing is that I need to download for codecs? I can't seem to find it!
[06:43] <Qwell> You MIGHT get lucky with 6.10, but I haven't yet
[06:43] <morten_> bimberi: is there some way to trick it? to manually overflow ram?
[06:44] <bimberi> morten_: sorry, no idea
[06:44] <Luke> TheGino_Frank: yea but i dont like FF or thunderbird
[06:44] <TheGino_Frank> ok
[06:44] <techno_freak> how do i check the dependencies of a .deb package ? is there any option in apt-get or dpkg ?
[06:44] <Jordan_U> z9999, You are in luck though, AFIK all broadcom cards have native linux drivers.
[06:44] <z9999> Jordan_U: Yes, we did that and it says it is a Broadcom Corporation: Unknown device 4311 (Rev 01)
[06:44] <Luke> Qwell: pan is PERFECT! thanks!
[06:44] <Qwell> Jordan_U: except that "old" kernels don't support minipcie :P
[06:45] <Jordan_U> Qwell, ?
[06:45] <Qwell> broadcom 4311 is minipci express
[06:45] <Qwell> at least, in the V3000Z's
[06:45] <ixian_> !automatix
[06:45] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[06:45] <Qwell> (and 6000)
[06:45] <Jordan_U> Qwell, Didn't know that :)
[06:46] <bimberi> morten_: i'd just keep opening OpenOffice apps and Firefox tabs/windows :)
[06:46] <fourat> bimberi !
[06:46] <jvolkman-h> did some recent edgy update break the home and Desktop entries in the "places" list in open/save file dialogs?
[06:46] <bimberi> fourat: hm?
[06:47] <CorrosionX> Anyone knows how to fix this? I try to start rsync --daemon but i just get back to the prompt no error msg nothing
[06:47] <fourat> bimberi, did you check your fs ?
[06:47] <jvolkman-h> home and "Desktop" are thin list items with no icon/title
[06:47] <arsalanyo> Halp Halp
[06:47] <Jordan_U> Qwell, So if he installed Edgy + restricted modules ( which includes firmware ) would that pretty much guarentee him wireless or is broadcom not as whell supported as I think?
[06:47] <bimberi> fourat: you've joined in the middle of a conversation
[06:47] <Tyler> k
[06:47] <Tyler> quick question about the auto partition in ubuntu
[06:48] <Tyler> not the erase-all option
[06:48] <Qwell> Jordan_U: it wouldn't guarantee much of anything
[06:48] <TheGino_Frank> bhudda, looking for w32 codecs ? look here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#w32codecs
[06:48] <z9999> I have been trying to get the wireless to work for over a month now and have followed numerous instructions to no avail, and would like to first know how to assure that I have removed all installs from previous attempts to eliminate any possible conflicts, and then begin from scratch.
[06:48] <Qwell> z9999: yeah, it isn't gonna happen, unless you patch your kernel
[06:49] <Qwell> ftp://lwfinger.dynalias.org/patches/patch_2.6.18.1_for_PCI-E
[06:49] <Jordan_U> z9999, Buy a supported card?
[06:49] <arsalanyo> i have installed windows on the new hard drive but then sold it , while installing windows i unpluged the ubuntu hard drive but not the privious windows drive now when it starts it just goes in the windows
[06:49] <Qwell> Jordan_U: not an option
[06:49] <Qwell> Jordan_U: HP BIOS locks the wireless cards. :)
[06:49] <Tyler> does the auto-partition for continuously available memory work well and/or affect the other (windows) drive in any way?
[06:49] <dean_> !nvidia
[06:49] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:50] <h1v> Are there any common installation problems with the 6.10 installer CD? I've tried booting up the LiveCD on two different computers and it hangs at the same spot every time
[06:50] <Luke> does anyone know of a good newsgroup reader that supports SSL besides thunderbird/FF?
[06:50] <arsalanyo> Halp Halp please
[06:50] <Qwell> h1v: I've seen the same on several (older/junkier) computers
[06:51] <Jordan_U> h1v, Have you tried running a checksum to see if it is burned correctly ?
[06:51] <arsalanyo> i have to fix the bootloader
[06:51] <arsalanyo> i dont know how
[06:51] <Jordan_U> !grub
[06:51] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:51] <h1v> Jordan_U: yeah, it said that it was all fine
[06:51] <arsalanyo> windows does not recognize ubuntu
[06:52] <tgelter> using ffmpeg or mencoder, how can I convert from xvid to divx? (my dvd player at home only reads divx...and dvd of course)
[06:52] <h1v> Qwell: I tried it on an 800mhz older dell model, and a athlonXP 3200+
[06:52] <Jordan_U> arsalanyo, Did you install windows after Ubuntu?
[06:53] <arsalanyo> i unpluged the ubuntu than installed windows but didnt unplug the privious windows drive
[06:53] <Jordan_U> h1v, You may get more info by removing the "quiet" kernel parameter at boot.
[06:53] <z9999> Qwell: I have no idea how to patch the kernel, and we are trying to be very cautious as we can't afford to lose the use of the system. We are in an area where there is nothing but forest, plants, trees, insects, and animals, using a 2 way satellite for internet so we're stuck using what we have or can obtain over the internet.
[06:53] <h1v> Jordan_U: Already done
[06:54] <h1v> Thats how i know that they both hang at the same place
[06:55] <arsalanyo> Jordan_U yeterday when my comp started after 10-15 sec it asked me for the boot options but not today
[06:55] <Jordan_U> Qwell, Would knoppix likely have support?
[06:55] <arsalanyo> i edited the boot.ini to remove the 2nd windows option
[06:56] <rothga1> is there a way to make ubuntu log in automatically with a system account? (mythtv)
[06:56] <Qwell> Jordan_U: maybe the very latest experimental version
[06:56] <rothga1> the option isn't available on the login security section
[06:56] <Jordan_U> arsalanyo, You probably need to reinstall grub as windows clobbered it, look at  the link from ubotu.
[06:56] <xenex> anyone experienced with imagemagick?
[06:57] <arsalanyo> ok
[06:57] <arsalanyo> but i need to tell you that i dont have passwords for either of the operating system i have to go through a new hard drive
[06:57] <arsalanyo> is it possible
[06:57] <arsalanyo> ??
[06:57] <z9999> Again, can someone provide the correct sequence of instructions to execute to remove all previous installs and a way to confirm that everything is clean?
[06:58] <Jordan_U> arsalanyo, You can just use a liveCD.
[06:58] <arsalanyo> aha great
[06:58] <arsalanyo> and than just install the grub right
[06:58] <Jordan_U> z9999, I am not sure such a set of commands exists.
[06:59] <rredd4> z9999 there is a clean command for apt, but you just have to trust that it works
[06:59] <arsalanyo> ??
[07:00] <Trevinho> A new flashplayer is out......
[07:00] <bhudda> Is there really?
[07:00] <Trevinho> yes
[07:00] <Trevinho> I've just packaged it.......
[07:00] <Jordan_U> !flash9
[07:00] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[07:00] <z9999> Jordan_U: I have been using some commands such a ndiswrapper -e and modprobe and had the belief they were removing things previously installed. Am I wrong?
[07:00] <Trevinho> if you want it it's in my repo ^_^
[07:00] <Trevinho> flashplayer and flashplugin just packaged for Ubuntu ;) -> http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/dists/edgy/3v1n0/
[07:00] <Jordan_U> Trevinho, New as in newer version of flash9 or just flash9?
[07:01] <macogw> hey is it possible to get nautilus from gnome 2.14 even if youre on edgy?
[07:01] <Trevinho> newer of flash9
[07:01] <Trevinho> 9.0.21.78
[07:01] <Trevinho> fixed audio problems ;)
[07:02] <sn00p|> Where do I put the codecs for mplayer in ubuntu?
[07:02] <bhudda> bloody heck....how come when I close VLC it keeps on playing audio of the file it was playing? Argh! How do I stop that!?
[07:02] <xenex> anyone experienced with imagemagick?
[07:03] <quizy> has anyone had good experiences with beryl?
[07:03] <macogw> nevermind
[07:03] <Trevinho> I've quizy
[07:03] <macogw> found the "browser view" option
[07:03] <Trevinho> or just come in #beryl
[07:03] <Jordan_U> quizy, Verry good :)
[07:03] <quizy> is it simple to setup?
[07:04] <Jordan_U> quizy, Depends , but usually yes.
[07:04] <rredd4> sn00p|  go to ubuntu wiki, type restrictedformats  you will see the codecs....  w32codecs
[07:04] <mister_roboto> is it possible to get "focus follows mouse" in beryl?  i love it but hate losing that
[07:04] <Jordan_U> mister_roboto, Yes.
[07:04] <mister_roboto> Jordan_U: what do you have to do? it's set in my kde window behavior
[07:05] <J-_> Where can I find a Ubuntu LAMP server tutorial
[07:05] <bimberi> !lamp
[07:05] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[07:05] <Jordan_U> mister_roboto, You need to set it in beryl-settings-manager
[07:05] <J-_> thanks
[07:05] <mister_roboto> Jordan_U: ahhh, ok.
[07:06] <Jordan_U> quizy, If you have an intel card and are running Edgy it is two steps.
[07:07] <john> hey hey hey ... where the females at.. hit me up
[07:07] <Jordan_U> quizy, If you are using an ATI card with fglrx it is somewhat harder.
[07:07] <quizy> jordan, I have a gma950
[07:07] <quizy> intel
[07:07] <rothga1> how do I edit my gdm.conf-custom file to log-in automatically?
[07:08] <cafuego> rothga1: Just go to the login manager settingsd in the admin menu.
[07:08] <rothga1> but the mythtv user is not available to login automatically
[07:08] <Jordan_U> quizy, On Edgy?
[07:10] <Lovloss> I know we all hate windows here, and believe me - I despise it almost as much as i do certain politicians - but I just messed up my girlfriend's computer in an attempt to install ubuntu and i want to see if anyone has a solution.
[07:10] <rothga1> cafuego: I added him under the users tab but still no dice
[07:10] <Lovloss> Specifically, her cd drive doesnt work, so i cant use my boot cd, and it doesnt except usb ports. So i found an online method on the ubuntu website to install linux while on windows.
[07:11] <Lovloss> When i rebooted, it refused, saying "hal.dll" was missing. I found it, put it in the folder system32, and now neither windows OR linux will start
[07:11] <Lovloss> ideas?
[07:11] <rothga1> Lovloss: If the cd dosen't work for boot, check the bios to see if it is detected
[07:11] <Lovloss> No, her cd drive is just crap
[07:11] <Lovloss> it loads ubuntu and then gets an "input output error from hdc"
[07:11] <Lovloss> crash
[07:11] <Jordan_U> Lovloss, Floppy drive available?
[07:11] <sky123> Holy crap..Hereos was good!...ok..Im back on topic :)
[07:12] <TheGino_Frank> how do I install Icons?
[07:12] <Jordan_U> sky123, Damn I missed it :(
[07:12] <Lovloss> ah yes there is a flopy drive
[07:12] <Lovloss> cant fit ubuntu on that :/
[07:12] <jvolkman-h> sky123, yeah it was pretty good tonight
[07:12] <quizy> jordan, yeah on edgy, do you have a link
[07:12] <sky123> Jordan_U: errmmmm. Bittorrent ;)
[07:12] <rothga1> cafuego: you have any other ideas to try? I looked it up in the forums but the guy who got it to work just said he edited the gdm.conf-custom file
[07:12] <rothga1> but I don't know how he edited it
[07:13] <Jordan_U> Lovloss, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot
[07:13] <Lovloss> I hate working with laptops lol
[07:13] <Lovloss> okay thank you!
[07:13] <sky123> jvolkman_h: yes...and i liked...their..uhmmm.ubuntu..style working together (futile attempt at staying on topic)
[07:13] <pluma> Stupid question: how can I switch from metacity to enlightenment?
[07:13] <cafuego> rothga1: There is an 'automatically login' option in there somewhere...
[07:13] <Lovloss> uh oh. how do i find out the ip addy >.<
[07:13] <rothga1> yes I know, but mythtv is not one of the options
[07:14] <Lovloss> her laptop wont even load up
[07:17] <rothga1> ok, I got it, I had to edit the gdm.conf file to make it work though :(
[07:17] <TuTUx> hi all is there anyway to auto active swap space? i upgraded my ram and found that my swap space didnt work (even with swapon) i fix that any way but no everytime i reboot i have to swapon it manually, any help?
[07:19] <Quinn_Storm> I'm running edgy, and in kde I can't get screensavers to start at all, it works with test/setup/etc. but actually launching the screensaver (either through lock screen or dcop kdesktop KScreensaverIface lock/save) doesn't work
[07:20] <noiesmo> Quinn_Storm, mine works I use xscreensaver -nosplash & in .kde/Auostart
[07:20] <Luke> are you really quinn storm?
[07:20] <Luke> or just a fan?
[07:20] <Quinn_Storm> xscreensaver, noiesmo ? we're not talking sxcreensaver, we're talking kscreensaver, different systm
[07:20] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: I'm really quinn
[07:20] <Luke> ha oh
[07:20] <sky123> TuTUx: dont know if its still practice...but other linux distros used to recommend putting swap space partition in an LVM. If you increased the RAM, then you could simply inrease the LVM as well.. im not sure if you can increase now.
[07:20] <noiesmo> Quinn_Storm, I use xscreensaver because kscreen doesnt work thats all Im saying
[07:21] <Quinn_Storm> noiesmo: ah, lol
[07:21] <phpError> Evening.
[07:21] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: do you have a website?
[07:21] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: not really
[07:21] <dreamstateheroic> hi, i am following this forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1786469#post1786469  and i am having trouble when i try to install the driver through ndiswrappers it says something with the code at line 167.  Any help with getting my wireless up?
[07:21] <Quinn_Storm> I mean there's www.beryl-project.org but that's not what you want
[07:21] <barata> hallo all ... how to JOIN several avi files in Linux?
[07:22] <noiesmo> Quinn_Storm, I havent been able to get kscreensaver working since using either xgl/compiz or aiglx/beryl
[07:22] <Quinn_Storm> noiesmo: it won't work even using just kwin
[07:22] <noiesmo> barata, man avimerge
[07:22] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: i searched all over for a blog or something but couldnt find it. anyway... what other projects have you worked on?
[07:22] <rosen37>  Hello ? I m trying xubuntu  and I don t know how to load prog at the start session ( I add it info in the .xession) but it seems not loaded?
[07:22] <noiesmo> Quinn_Storm, bugger
[07:22] <Quinn_Storm> beryl is pretty much my first public project...I wrote a dock-type applet for the xfce panel long ago
[07:22] <barata> man avimerge
[07:22] <barata> thanks noiesmo!
[07:23] <noiesmo> barata, np
[07:23] <barata> is avimerge in the repository?
[07:23] <noiesmo> barata, one sec not sure were i got it
[07:23] <TuTUx> sky123, no i didnt put it in a LVM. i didnt change its size neither since i already set it large enough, im just need to know how to automount it at reboot. except you are saying it's not working any more?
[07:23] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: i'm just interested as to where your experience comes from?
[07:23] <Jordan_U> !info avimerge
[07:23] <ubotu> Package avimerge does not exist in any distro I know
[07:24] <barata> noiesmo, does avimerge work for you?
[07:24] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: I'm just self-taught
[07:24] <Quinn_Storm> grr, xscreensaver doesn't list skyrocket
[07:24] <sky123> TutUx: well since you did made it bigger it should work for you..some people dont allocate enough, increase physical memory and are then stuck.
[07:24] <noiesmo> barata, think its part of transcode not 100%
[07:24] <TuTUx> Quinn_Storm, hi Quinn, is that guy on beryl's blog really you?
[07:24] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: thats awesome! this is your first project lead position?
[07:24] <Quinn_Storm> TuTUx: that's me, and I'm a girl, mtf tg
[07:24] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: yeah
[07:24] <barata> do you use it noiesmo?
[07:25] <noiesmo> barata, yeah i have
[07:25] <barata> cool! http://linuxreviews.org/man/avimerge/
[07:25] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: must be nerve racking with all this publicity
[07:25] <Quinn_Storm> its not so bad
[07:25] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: i think your doing an awesome job btw
[07:25] <Quinn_Storm> thanks Luke
[07:25] <noiesmo> barata, avimerge -o name -i file1  file2
[07:25] <Jordan_U> Quinn_Storm, Hoz it feel to be a celebrety ;)
[07:25] <Luke> haha oh shit
[07:25] <Limulf> I asked an hour or so ago if there was a way to hide IRC join/part messages using "XChat-GNOME". Someone here (whose nick I don't remember) tried to help me and said that the option was not available. I have been told otherwise at #xchat-gnome: all you need to do is enter the command "/set irc_conf_mode 1". All channels you join after that won't display the join/part lines :)
[07:25] <Luke> look what i started
[07:25] <barata> noiesmo, do you also rip VOBs to avi?
[07:26] <barata> what do you use?
[07:26] <noiesmo> barata, yeah have done it to also convert avi back to vobs to
[07:26] <dreamstateheroic> can someone help me with my wireless card?
[07:26] <LineOf7s-> Howdy people - love your work.  How/where do I go about sorting out keymaps for use by a terminal (gnome-terminal for example - or any other recommended one)?  I need to emulate a VT320, and I have the key maps to do it, but I don't know where to put them...  :o(
[07:26] <barata> what do you use noiesmo?
[07:26] <barata> for vob2avi
[07:26] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: how do you pay the bills if you are a project lead?
[07:27] <TuTUx> sky123, but it just wont be actived everytime i reboot..
[07:27] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: I'm unemployed, live "at home"
[07:28] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: do you ever try to get "hired" by OSDN or something?
[07:28] <sky123> TutUx: just read something - Under most UNIX variants, swap is added automatically at boot time as part of the kernel initialization. Most use lines in the file system mount file /etc/fstab
[07:28] <TuTUx> Quinn_Storm, sorry if i was rude, i didnt mean to be like that...
[07:28] <Jordan_U> Quinn_Storm, You might try #kubuntu
[07:29] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: I've not yet tried, I wouldn't mind getting a job
[07:29] <Quinn_Storm> TuTUx: you weren't that I know of
[07:29] <barata> damned... why I cannot find that avimerge?
[07:29] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: well you shouldnt have too much trouble now... I'm just wondering because i'm tyring to make a career out of this but I dont see how OSS progammers make any money =)
[07:29] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: its harder than it looks, I only have a GED, no college degree, etc.
[07:30] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: damn. i'm spending thousands on a cs degree from purdue but... i dont want to work in the corp world
[07:30] <Quinn_Storm> lol
[07:30] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: i'm searching desprately for something like your doing where I can get payed
[07:30] <Luke> but... i may just have to live at home as well
[07:30] <cafuego> Luke: linus seems to manage just fine ;-)
[07:31] <Jordan_U> Luke, By working for crazy Billionare astronaughts?
[07:31] <Luke> OSDN pays him a lot
[07:31] <Luke> linus that is
[07:31] <Luke> Jordan_U: well that would be nice
[07:31] <sky123> Quinn_Storm: unfortunately this time of season is slow... join the party I suppose.
[07:31] <Luke> tell that to Quinn_Storm tho
[07:31] <crimsun> Luke: eh? Canonical employs a few; Red Hat, Novell, Nokia, ...
[07:31] <rickyfingers> OK I'm going to butt in to the conversation here and mention something about getting paid doing OSS work
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:31] <sky123> Quinn_Storm: right there with ya
[07:32] <rickyfingers> the first thing I thought about was if you check out the kernel mailing list archives, you'll see a lot of people with email addresses from prestigious companies
[07:32] <noiesmo> barata, sorry lost keyboard
[07:32] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: have you talked to shuttleworth about a job? seems like ubuntu is pushing hard for native beryl
[07:32] <Jordan_U> Quinn_Storm, Since Feisty will have Beryl ( or compiz ) on by default you might get a job at connonical.
[07:32] <Luke> Jordan_U: =D
[07:33] <rickyfingers> Since the kernel's the part of linux that's been around the longest, I think that has something to do with it.
[07:33] <Quinn_Storm> #1 they don't really need another manager(me), and #2 I can't talk about it but there are related developments wrt canonical, beryl
[07:33] <Luke> rickyfingers: linux is the kernel
[07:33] <barata> noiesmo, I find it, you're right ... it is part of transcode
[07:33] <noiesmo> ok barata I 'm a bit slack when video edit etc I use mencoder part of mplayer and also I have dvdshrick and dvddycrypter installed thru wine
[07:33] <rickyfingers> The kernel hackers do work that a lot of companies can benefit from
[07:34] <barata> me too noiesmo ...:) I just use Xilisoft on vmware
[07:34] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: with a name like yours... you should just become a movie star or something
[07:34] <rickyfingers> The other thing is we've started using linux where I work to do certain things
[07:34] <barata> but Xilisoft cannot join the avi files it produced
[07:34] <sky123> Cannonical and Shuttleworth typically have "so much" they have per year..and allocate money to those that have made significant contributions...i went through the same conversation on edubuntu channel .
[07:34] <or10n> Hi I have a problem I am attempting to create a 1Gig ram drive but when do i mke2fs -m 0 /dev/ram0 I get the error: mke2fs: File too large while trying to determine filesystem size.. I thought that the max file size on ext2 was 2G so why am i getting these errors?
[07:34] <noiesmo> barata, this is the guide for dvdshrink etc http://mrbass.org/linux/ubuntu/dvdshrink/
[07:34] <Quinn_Storm> lol, Luke
[07:34] <TuTUx> sky123, that's actually my other question, since i read the solution about swap on ubuntu forum, i did everything about replace the right UUID in /etc/fstab and stuff(sorry i dont remember exactly) but since i have two kernel (i386 and generic) the update-initramfs -u only regenerate the file for generic but actually im always using the other kernel..
[07:35] <barata> noiesmo, I have no problem with producing avi files or ripping dvd ... my problem is JOINING the output (those avi files)
[07:35] <rickyfingers> What it took was a boss who really knew his stuff about security, and what you can do with linux
[07:35] <noiesmo> Quinn_Storm, do you know why my keyboard playsup/locks occassionally in beryl aiglx
[07:35] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: anyway I'll let you get back to fixing your screensaver...
[07:35] <mo^> is it possible to use multiple wireless networks with /etc/network/interfaces and wpa_supplicant? i can't use the network-manager.
[07:35] <Quinn_Storm> noiesmo: no...that's odd
[07:35] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: ty :-P
[07:35] <sky123> TuTUx: dont know if this is too generic but check this out - http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-satswapspace.html
[07:35] <Luke> thanks for answering my questions
[07:35] <Quinn_Storm> I don't mind
[07:35] <Luke> i'm suprised I got the chance to ask
[07:35] <Quinn_Storm> I just only have so much...me to go around :-P
[07:36] <Luke> haha totally
[07:36] <Luke> i understand
[07:36] <Luke> you should come to purdue and give a presentation to our LUG!
[07:36] <Quinn_Storm> lol
[07:36] <Quinn_Storm> pay for me and I will
[07:36] <Luke> i'll look into it
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> hey quinn -- your beryl completely hangs on edgy with the latest 8.30 ati drivers -- although XGL was working fine with them.
[07:36] <TuTUx> sky123, thanks i gonna read it
[07:36] <Quinn_Storm> cool, Luke
[07:36] <dreamer> hmm, in kde, I can't use ctr+tab to switch between Desktops
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> so now I'm using it with the non ati.com drivers.
[07:36] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: are you close to Indiana?
[07:36] <Quinn_Storm> fyrestrtr: are you using Xgl? you can't use beryl+ati.com without xgl
[07:36] <PhibreOptix> Anybody know where I can download Kylix Open Edition 3 from?
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: Pennsylvania
[07:37] <Luke> damn thats a looong drive
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> yeah
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> and I don't drive
[07:37] <Luke> we cant afford that then =(
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> don't have a clue how to
[07:37] <Luke> hahaha
[07:37] <Luke> awesome
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> its ok, I'd have come if i could
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> Quinn_Storm: I was using xgl -- but after constant lockups; I gave up and am now on the 'vanilla' drivers.
[07:37] <barata> lucky me ... I find the torrent for transcode
[07:37] <Luke> Quinn_Storm: understood
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> fyrestrtr: ah, on those you should be able to beryl
[07:37] <Quinn_Storm> Luke: I love linux
[07:37] <tuxavenger> I am installing edgy and I i am keeping my home folder from my old distro, but when I startup and login I get a system message that says that i need to change the permissions of /home/<user>/.dmrc to 644, how should i go about setting my whole home folder to the right permissions so that only I have access to read and write
[07:38] <Luke> same... i'm  plug president
[07:38] <Apex> How do I install xine-lib-1.1.2.tar.bz2?
[07:38] <noiesmo_> barata, get avimerge it should merge them
[07:38] <noiesmo_> Quinn_Storm, its a particular keystroke but i just knocked keys and not sure which
[07:38] <fyrestrtr> yeah on the vanilla ones it works great :) I just wish AMD would stop trying to shrink processors for two hours and fix ATI's drivers.
[07:38] <umops> Can anyone help me?   I rebooted and now get the error ''Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)'-,  Check mysqld is running...
[07:38] <umops> The socket does not exist, and i Can't start mysqld
[07:38] <fyrestrtr> umops: what are you trying to start mysqld?
[07:38] <PhibreOptix> Tuxanvenger: I think you do 'sudo chmod /home/username/ 644'
[07:38] <Jordan_U> tuxavenger, It may be that your Ubuntu UID is not the same as it was in your previous distro, you might just need to change your UID.
[07:39] <fyrestrtr> umops: if you have installed mysql-server, it should be /etc/init.d/mysql start
[07:39] <noiesmo_> Quinn_Storm, I have this error in xorg.conf (EE) Error loading keymap /var/lib/xkb/server-0.xkm
[07:39] <Quinn_Storm> odd, noiesmo_
[07:39] <tuxavenger> Jordan_U: how do i go about doing that
[07:39] <noiesmo_> Quinn_Storm, i'm on dapper to edgy upgrade
[07:39] <umops> fyrestrtr, that's when i get the rror
[07:40] <fyrestrtr> umops: have you installed the server?
[07:40] <barata> noiesmo, I can apt-get transcode ... now, is avimerge part of it?
[07:40] <Jordan_U> tuxavenger, If sombody could help me break free of windows I could help you but without a terminal in front of me it is kind of hard :)
[07:40] <umops> yes, it has been working in the past
[07:40] <tuxavenger> ok
[07:41] <noiesmo_> barata, yeah why not :)
[07:41] <Jordan_U> tuxavenger, Basically, you need to look at the UID of the owner of your /home and change your UID to that UID.
[07:41] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I heard a baseball can help you break out of windows...
[07:41] <PhibreOptix> Anybody know any good, free FPS for Ubuntu?
[07:41] <fyrestrtr> umops: is it running right now? Could just be a stalled process.
[07:42] <barata> cool
[07:42] <Quinn_Storm> odd, I don't seem to *have* an LP page
[07:42] <ArrenLex> tuxavenger: if I correctly understand what it is you're trying to do, you're looking for the command "ls -l /home"
[07:42] <fyrestrtr> PhibreOptix: Tremulous
[07:42] <Quinn_Storm> oh there I am, lol
[07:42] <Jordan_U> PhibreOptix, Let me try something...
[07:42] <Jordan_U> !games | PhibreOptix
[07:42] <ubotu> PhibreOptix: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[07:42] <umops> fyrestrtr, How do I check that?  ps -aux | grep mysql returns nothing
[07:43] <Jordan_U> PhibreOptix, Is there anything Ubotu DOESN'T know ?
[07:43] <Jordan_U> :)
[07:43] <joe_> Okay, so I just restarted my computer
[07:43] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Yes. Watch:
[07:43] <joe_> and now X doesn't start
[07:43] <ArrenLex> !meaningoflife
[07:43] <tuxavenger> ArrenLex: nope, but i think i got it
[07:43] <joe_> I get this error when i startx:
[07:43] <tuxavenger> thanks though
[07:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about meaningoflife - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:43] <PhibreOptix> Lol
[07:43] <joe_> Error, 'nvidia' module not found
[07:43] <PhibreOptix> Thanks guys
[07:43] <joe_> but obviously it found it before because I was using it ?!
[07:43] <umops> fyrestrtr, /var/run/mysqld is also completley empty
[07:44] <ArrenLex> joe_: did you upgrade kernels recently?
[07:44] <joe_> probably

[07:45] <sky123> TuTUx: just read through that myself right now..very very informative info on swapspace..stuff I wish I had known earlier
[07:45] <barata> I'm still merging them though .... I'll check it soon with vlc
[07:46] <noiesmo_> barata, cool
[07:47] <barata> it is working so NICELY ... thanks for the hint noiesmo ....:) :)

[07:48] <jfm3> I gave away another 10 Ubuntu CDs today.
[07:48] <Quinn_Storm> cool
[07:48] <Jordan_U> @lart ArrenLex
[07:48] <Quinn_Storm> I left mine at UDS by accident o_O
[07:49] <ArrenLex> Ow.
[07:49] <sky123> Good article on allocation of swapspace - http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-satswapspace.html
[07:49] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, That'll teach to not go arount inciting bot wars :)
[07:49] <jfm3> We still need a better motto than "Linux for Human Beings".  That just too much implies that other distributions are only for inhuman geeks.
[07:50] <jfm3> I propose "Linux for Wedges of Cheese".
[07:50] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, There is the word you somwhere in that sentence too :)
[07:50] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: but.. but.. mencoder totally owns trascode!

[07:50] <sky123> Linux for Heroes
[07:50] <noiesmo_> barata, I use kde and I have installed this app from kde apps http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=30455
[07:51] <jfm3> "Linux With Some Sense Smacked Into It"
[07:51] <sky123> Itll be like depeche - Linux for the masses
[07:51] <Stanislav> any know if its possible to repair ubuntu if u moved the harddrive to another PC?
[07:51] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: that depends on what's broken.
[07:51] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Should just boot AFIK.
[07:52] <Stanislav> well ubuntu doesnt load period the harddrive is a slave on IDE1 instead of primary on IDE0
[07:52] <Stanislav> now
[07:52] <sky123> Actually...that depends if it is the ONLY hdd in the system
[07:52] <Stanislav> seconds HD
[07:52] <|thunder> anyone know where to put config options to make iwcofig settigns perm ?
[07:52] <hot_wheelz> hi any here got a link for the new Ubuntu Multimedia Center other than http://linux.cubegames.net/download - (dead)
[07:52] <Stanislav> the PC that i had ubuntu on kinda had a small mishap today
[07:52] <Stanislav> and i dont wnt to reconfigure everything =\
[07:52] <jfm3> Stanislav: as I'm sure many will point out, you probably need to do something special in the BIOS to boot of a secondary ("slave") disk.
[07:53] <barata> noiesmo, what app is that?
[07:53] <Stanislav> oh i can get it to boot ubuntu...
[07:53] <Stanislav> but it gets stuck
[07:53] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: a) does grub know how to find it? b) does /etc/fstab point to the correct drive?
[07:53] <Stanislav> on the loadign screen
[07:53] <Stanislav> at like 1%
[07:53] <sky123> might have to also mess with the bootloader
[07:53] <Stanislav> well when i hit ubuntu on grub it has the loading screen
[07:53] <Stanislav> and freezes
[07:53] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: boot in "recovery mode" for some helpful debugging output.
[07:53] <Stanislav> i tried that..
[07:53] <sky123> agrees with Stanislav comment about grub
[07:53] <Stanislav> it says IDE0 busy
[07:53] <Stanislav> or something like that
[07:54] <Stanislav> let meget  exact error
[07:54] <Stanislav> let me boot that pc agian
[07:54] <noiesmo_> barata, its adds service menu so when you right click on a video you can select various conversion options
[07:54] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Probably just need to reconfigure GRUB.
[07:55] <Stanislav> ubuntu doesnt care if i changed all the hardware completely?
[07:55] <rickyfingers> |thunder: check out the wireless man page, man wireless
[07:55] <Stanislav> i know windows doesnt allow booting on a foren PC
[07:55] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Boot a live CD, chroot into your install on the HD, bind /dev and run: update-grub
[07:55] <gyaresu> anyone know how to fix the nvidia 1.0.8776 bug which won't let me 'control + alt + plus/minus' to change resolutions?
[07:55] <rickyfingers> |thunder: that will tell you the syntax for adding wireless config info to /etc/network/interfaces
[07:56] <Stanislav> kk let me try that
[07:56] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: your X will likely break because your drivers will be different... but the rest should be able to handle it.
[07:56] <Stanislav> when i am on the live cd
[07:56] <Stanislav> i choose which optin?
[07:56] <Stanislav> its in the live CD menu atm
[07:56] <|thunder> rickyfingers; ill look again.
[07:56] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Nope, Ubuntu could care less, a little change in hardware won't even phase it :)
[07:56] <Stanislav> on liveCD
[07:56] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Regular live boot
[07:56] <Stanislav> do i hit start ubuntu?
[07:56] <Stanislav> kk
[07:56] <Stanislav> its loading
[07:57] <Stanislav> the PC i had ubuntu on for some reason had low FPS in shit.... so i tried toclean it.. left the room and my cat stepped on the CPU fan..
[07:57] <Stanislav> its all cracked lol
[07:57] <Stanislav> >_>
[07:57] <TuTUx> Quinn_Storm, hi Quinn, beryl gonna include in next ubuntu (7.04)?
[07:57] <diminthedam> hello. how do i tell my NetworkManager to search for other networks only when disconnected?
[07:57] <Quinn_Storm> not sure yet, TuTUx
[07:57] <Quinn_Storm> well it'll be in universe at least
[07:58] <Jordan_U> TuTUx, That or compiz.
[07:58] <Stanislav> ok the live cd booted
[07:58] <Stanislav> where do i go?
[07:58] <Jordan_U> TuTUx, But one of the two for sure.
[07:58] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Open a terminal
[07:59] <Stanislav> opened
[07:59] <TuTUx> ya, i know, but since beryl is so popular in ubuntu
[07:59] <Phenax> I'm eating mini-carrots so I can stay up late and watch a "R" rated movie.
[07:59] <Stanislav> now what
[07:59] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, You need to mount the hard drive...
[07:59] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Use gparted to find the device name if you don't know what it is.
[08:00] <Stanislav> loading gparted heh
[08:01] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: "sudo fdisk -l" might be more convenient for that
[08:01] <Stanislav> it found my hds..
[08:01] <Stanislav> for some reason
[08:01] <Stanislav> there is a 3rd one
[08:01] <Stanislav> with 30gigs on it?
[08:01] <Stanislav> lol
[08:01] <Stanislav> is that what ubunutu allocated?
[08:01] <Quinn_Storm> wow, you lost 30 gigs?
[08:01] <barata> i c noiesmo
[08:01] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Please take over any time, I am just going from memory with no linux box :(
[08:02] <digiqq> hey guys, how do I modify kernel parameters in ubuntu??
[08:02] <Stanislav> i have /dev/sda - /dev/sdb (where ubuntu is installed) and /dev/sdc (i ahve no idea what thit is)
[08:02] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Nono, you're doing fine... I'm just fleshing things out.
[08:02] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: if you don't know what /dev/sdc is, how do you know that ubuntu isn't on /dev/sdc and /dev/sdb isn't the random drive you can't place?
[08:03] <Stanislav> cause
[08:03] <Stanislav> lol its easy
[08:03] <jarrad> What is a good site for Rhythmbox Plugins, I can't seem to find one via google?
[08:03] <Stanislav> sda = the systems native drive.. with windows only on it.. 250gig only using 70
[08:03] <Stanislav> sb2 has the partitions  of the drive i had ubuntu on
[08:03] <Phenax> I'm eating mini-carrots so I can stay up late and watch a "R" rated movie.
[08:03] <Stanislav> sdb*
[08:03] <Stanislav> and sdc i dunno wtf it is.. cause its only 30gigs
[08:03] <ArrenLex> Phenax: heard you the first time, thanks.
[08:03] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, mkdir /ubuntu_install
[08:04] <Phenax> ArrenLex: my mom blocked myspace.com can i eat mini-carrots to ficx????
[08:04] <Stanislav> k
[08:04] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb /ubuntu_install
[08:04] <Stanislav> k sec
[08:05] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, I will need you to check me on the mount / bind command
[08:05] <Stanislav> uhh gives me error.. i should mention sdb consists of a NTFS Ext3 and a Swap
[08:05] <Euphidime> Stanislav: You should be able to specify which partition to mount.
[08:05] <phlasphy> hey all
[08:05] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, What partition is the ext3?
[08:05] <Stanislav> sec let me tell u
[08:05] <Stanislav> 2
[08:06] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /ubuntu_install
[08:06] <Stanislav> ok
[08:06] <Stanislav> worked
[08:07] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, sudo mount -bind /dev /ubuntu_install/dev ArrenLex correct?
[08:07] <Phenax> ym mom block myspace i eat mini carrot to fix
[08:07] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Dunno why you need bind mounts, but the command is sudo mount -o bind <folder1> <folder2>
[08:07] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I don't think you need to do that.
[08:07] <Stanislav> that didnt work.. anyway
[08:07] <Stanislav> lol
[08:08] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: /dev should populate itself automatically.
[08:08] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, OK
[08:08] <Phenax> ym mom block myspace i eat mini carrot to fix?? helol i need hlp
[08:08] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, sudo chroot /ubuntu_install
[08:08] <Xorlev> Lovely. Edgy + Software RAID = evil
[08:09] <Stanislav> ok
[08:09] <Stanislav> now o.o?
[08:09] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, I use lilo, but I believe the command update-grub makes grub look for new partitions?
[08:10] <Xorlev> Doesn't make it far past inittop script, gets to initializing usbcore and pauses. Every half second or so there'll be a half second of drive activity, then half no activity. Over and over.
[08:10] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: yes, that should work...
[08:10] <Phenax> ArrenLex: my mom blocked myspace.com can i eat mini-carrots to ficx????
[08:10] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Provided grub has the right drive root...
[08:10] <Quinn_Storm> ah well I have a semi-solution to screensaver nonsense
[08:11] <diminthedam> hello. how do i tell my NetworkManager to search for other networks only when disconnected?
[08:11] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Oh. No. You need to set the ubuntu drive root manually.
[08:11] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, By going into the grub prompt and setting root=?
[08:12] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Stanislav: sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:12] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: find the line # kopt=root=/dev/sda5 ro or whatever... it will be different for you.
[08:12] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: change that line to # kopt=root=/dev/sdb2 ro
[08:12] <Phenax> mini carrot fix??????
[08:13] <jfm3> Phenax: Organic carrots.
[08:13] <syntaxx> can somebody recommend me a light torrent client for X?
[08:13] <Phenax> mini carrot small carrot
[08:13] <Phenax>  eat make beter
[08:13] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: make sure that "groot" points to the correct grub partition... if grub is installed on the same partition as your ubuntu (probably), change the line # groot=(hd0,1)  (it may be different for you) to # groot=(hd1,1)
[08:13] <Healot> syntaxx: azureus
[08:13] <Healot> hehe
[08:14] <syntaxx> Healot, is it light?
[08:14] <xeon111> how do i enable multiverse

[08:14] <Stanislav> k
[08:14] <Stanislav> done that
[08:14] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: then, save and close out of nano by going ctrl+x - "y" - enter key (in case you aren't familiar with nano)
[08:15] <Stanislav> alsois there anyway.. to make grub be able to boot my windows on the other HD?
[08:15] <Phenax> mini carrot i have you buy??

[08:16] <Euphidime> Stanislav: So change the /dev/hd to the to the other Drive
[08:16] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: with those values adjusted to whatever is correct for your system, but that should work.
[08:16] <Stanislav> kk
[08:16] <Stanislav> gonna rebootnow
[08:16] <Healot> syntaxx: you need QT libraries for that... try the efault torrent client for GNOME
[08:16] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Wait
[08:16] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: no reboot!
[08:16] <sky123> ArrenLex: that was nice work...i learned a lot.
[08:16] <xeon111> !sound|xeon111
[08:16] <ubotu> xeon111: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[08:16] <Stanislav> ?
[08:17] <syntaxx> Healot, whats the name of it?
[08:17] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /ubuntu_install/etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:17] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: you're not done yet! You changed the bootloader, but not ubuntu itself.
[08:17] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: hold on. First, run "sudo nano /etc/fstab" and make sure all the filesystems in there match.
[08:17] <xeon111> any one here who can help me enable sound i have a sound blaster 16
[08:17] <Healot> syntaxx: it's on the submenu Internet
[08:17] <Stanislav> arg sec
[08:17] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, I didn't mean to give that command yet, but do that at the end :)
[08:17] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: that won't work, you have him in the chroot
[08:17] <Healot> having kubuntu atm
[08:17] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, I know.
[08:18] <syntaxx> Healot, sorry but i havent installed full gnome
[08:18] <sky123> ArrenLex: so he's doing this in rescue right?
[08:18] <ArrenLex> sky123: yes; booted from a livecd
[08:18] <Jordan_U> sky123, LiveCD
[08:18] <sky123> cool
[08:18] <Stanislav> reloading the live cd lol got ahead of myself
[08:19] <Jordan_U> sky123, Just moved his Ubuntu HD from another machine.
[08:19] <sky123> Now where does the new boot loader get written not in the mbr..so??
[08:19] <xeon111> any one here who can help me
[08:19] <sky123> right i caught that earlier
[08:19] <Stanislav> while i am waiting to have this load i gotta say my 3 days with ubuntu so far have been nice lol
[08:19] <Stanislav> 4*
[08:20] <sky123> ;)
[08:20] <ArrenLex> sky123: he will have to install the bootloader... now that he changed the root filesystems, he will need to sudo update-grub to rebuild the automagic kernel list, and then sudo grub-install /dev/sda to write it into the master boot block of the first drive.
[08:20] <Euphidime> Stanislav: Who recommended Ubuntu to you :P
[08:20] <Stanislav> not u actually..
[08:20] <Stanislav> i knew before lol
[08:20] <Stanislav> when u told me it had a live cd lol
[08:20] <Stanislav> i decided to try it lol
[08:20] <Stanislav> so i guess cause of u kinda lol
[08:20] <ArrenLex> !u
[08:20] <ubotu> Unless you're Dutch, the letter 'U' is not a pronoun.  If you want to be taken more seriously, please bother to type out the extra letters in "you".  The same goes for "why", "because", "anyone", and so on..
[08:21] <sky123> ArrenLex: very similar steps on centos as well.. which i had to do about 4 months ago
[08:21] <ArrenLex> sky123: yeah... Linux is Linux is Linux.
[08:21] <sky123> yep
[08:21] <ArrenLex> sky123: I had to go through it all a couple days ago, so I'm fresh... finally dumped ubuntu and went back to debian.
[08:21] <ArrenLex> (I hate ubuntu)
[08:22] <sky123> ArrenLex: lol
[08:22] <sky123> ArrenLex: well i suppose it is a natural progression of sorts..
[08:22] <ArrenLex> sky123: no; I started out on Debian. =P
[08:22] <sky123> :)
[08:22] <sky123> purist!
[08:22] <Stanislav> ok
[08:22] <ArrenLex> I am!
[08:23] <jordo23> Anyone here run Cedega?
[08:23] <Stanislav> i am back in ubuntu live
[08:23] <Stanislav> what next jordan?
[08:23] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: sudo nano /etc/fstab. There, make sure all your filesystems match what they are now
[08:23] <jordo23> huh?
[08:23] <Stanislav> all thats in there is
=== KC is now known as Guest589654
[08:23] <Stanislav> unionfs and tmpfs
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Oh. Of course. Sorry.
[08:24] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, You will need to do the chroot steps again...
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: sudo mkdir /target
[08:24] <Stanislav> i mounted the drive again
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: Stanislav: mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /target
[08:24] <Stanislav> did that heh
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: sudo chroot /target
[08:24] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: sudo nano /etc/fstab. There, make sure all your filesystems match what they are now
[08:24] <Stanislav> ah ok
[08:24] <Stanislav> didnt do that
[08:25] <sky123> Jordan_U: is that because he rebooted? before making the changes ArrenLex is working through??
[08:25] <Guest589654> hello, i can't Get an MIDI file to play, it says that another app is using the sequencer, but there is nothing using it.
[08:25] <Jordan_U> sky123, Yes.
[08:25] <sky123> ArrenLex: it would be nice to see a contrib of sorts in the wiki...
[08:25] <Stanislav> ok i am in that file
[08:25] <sky123> on this topic
[08:25] <ArrenLex> Guestsomenumbers: do you actually have a hardware midi sequencer?
[08:25] <sky123> it seems to unfortunately be typical
[08:26] <ArrenLex> sky123: which wiki is this?
[08:26] <sloncho> hi. I mounted and iso image to a directory, using: mount isofile.iso isodir -o loop. Now I can not umout, it says the device is busy. there is no process accessing this dir, i.e. lsof does not show anything. how can I umount the iso?
[08:26] <ubuntu> #o.uni58
[08:26] <Jordan_U> sky123, I think there is a fix grub on the live CD program spec for feisty.
[08:26] <sky123> ArrenLex: despite the errrrm..dislike for ubuntu...the ubuntu one..
[08:26] <ArrenLex> sloncho: fuser -m <directory> will show you what's using it.
[08:26] <ArrenLex> sky123: of course; I meant, point me to the page.
[08:26] <Stanislav> well it has the partitions in here but my windows parition is /dev/hda1 atm in there.. should i change that to dev/sdb1?
[08:26] <ademan> is there a package for google earth?
[08:26] <ademan> !google earth
[08:26] <ubotu> Google Earth is now available, for free (only as in price), for Linux, too. To download it see http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html
[08:26] <Jordan_U> sky123, Perhaps migrating an install should be added.
[08:27] <ArrenLex> ademan: No; it's closed-source.
[08:27] <sky123> Jordan_U: yeah..but it surprises me even Linux Mag classifies Dapper as the next best thing to Eft milk.
[08:27] <sky123> yep
[08:27] <sloncho> ArrenLex, nothing :(
[08:27] <sky123> !wiki
[08:27] <ubotu> wiki is http://wiki.ubuntu.com - Loads of user-contributed documentation
[08:27] <sky123> there you are
[08:27] <ademan> ArrenLex: you can make binary packages of closed source things though
[08:27] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: isn't your windows partition on your first drive, i.e. /dev/sda1?
[08:27] <Stanislav> i have 2 windows heh.. cause i put this HD from another PC
[08:27] <ArrenLex> ademan: yes, but not upload them to the ubuntu repos, unless I'm much mistaken.
[08:28] <Stanislav> the first harddrive has a windows.. and the ubuntu harddrive has windows on the first partition
[08:28] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: do you actually want to be able to boot them both?
[08:28] <ademan> ArrenLex: oh, is that a policy thing?

[08:28] <Stanislav> no but its mounted cause i have my files on the NTFS parition
[08:28] <ArrenLex> ademan: I'm not clear on ubuntu packaging policy. I probably shouldn't confuse you.
[08:28] <sky123> By the way...anyone working for Canonical in here??
[08:28] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Multiverse will allow it.
[08:28] <ArrenLex> Okay.
[08:28] <ademan> ArrenLex: do some of the third party repos probably have that sort of thing?
[08:28] <kling0n> strange, strange issue on edgy...... I have 2 installs.... on my workstation, flash (macromedia) is working beautifully under firefox... on my laptop, it crashes
[08:29] <ademan> kling0n: that's a documented problem, i don't remember the specific fix unfortunately though
[08:29] <sky123> kling0n: is one a 64 bit system??
[08:29] <xeon111> i need help to configure my sound i have a soundblaster 16 sound card
[08:29] <ArrenLex> kling0n: 7, 9b1, 9b2?
[08:29] <kling0n> if i install the gpl flash player besides the macromedia one, it stops crashing, but only uses the gpl flash module
[08:29] <Stanislav> the Ext3 partition mount is spercified by a UUID? should i change that to /dev/sdb2?
[08:29] <kling0n> 32 bit
[08:29] <kling0n> intel
[08:29] <Healot> xeon111: a PCI or an ISA card?
[08:29] <trench-_> what's the flash plugin for kubuntu
[08:29] <kling0n> macromedia 7
[08:29] <xeon111> i think its a isa
[08:30] <trench-_> thanks
[08:30] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: I don't know anything about this crazy UUID business... sorry. Could someone field that question for Stanislav?
[08:30] <kling0n> ademan: yah.. Ive found the bug... but no resolution

[08:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sound blaster 16 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:31] <kling0n> ArrenLex:  its macromedia 7

[08:31] <ubotu> xeon111: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[08:31] <ArrenLex> kling0n: I heard. Macromedia 7 is notoriously horrible... how about using a 9 beta?
[08:31] <sloncho> hi. I mounted and iso image to a directory, using: mount isofile.iso isodir -o loop. Now I can not umout, it says the device is busy. there is no process accessing this dir, i.e. lsof and fuser does not show anything. how can I umount the iso?
=== Guest589654 is now known as CarCase928
[08:32] <kling0n> ArrenLex:  well.. its definitely an option (if I can find a repo) .. but it quirks me that it works on one of my installs and not the other
[08:32] <sky123> xeon111: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=13366
[08:32] <Healot> 9 beta is more stable
[08:32] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: from what I skimmed in a few seconds from wikipedia, UUID might actually be fine. If it doesn't break you can always change it later. Leave it for now.
[08:32] <Stanislav> k
[08:32] <Stanislav> but the windows
[08:32] <kling0n> ArrenLex:  any pointers for finding the macromedia flash player 9 beta?
[08:32] <Jordan_U> flash9 | kling0n
[08:33] <Stanislav> should i change it to /dev/sdb1 ? if its /dev/hda1 ?
[08:33] <kling0n> !flash9
[08:33] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[08:33] <ArrenLex> kling0n: probably you do not have alsa-oss installed on one of them, or else your firefox DSP is set differently on one of them, or your alsa driver is different for one of them and isn't compatible with whatever bastardised monstrous action flash 7 is trying to wring out of it.
[08:33] <kling0n> hehe
[08:33] <kling0n> so you think it might be a sound issue
[08:34] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: your /etc/fstab only determines what shows up in your ubuntu system. Which windows drive will you be accessing from the ubuntu system?
[08:34] <ArrenLex> kling0n: Flash 7 itself IS one big sound issue.
[08:34] <Stanislav> well thats no problem at the moment
[08:34] <Stanislav> after fstab is ok
[08:34] <Stanislav> what else should i do?
[08:34] <sky123> ArrenLex: jeez...i think youve literally rebuilt his system....lol :)
[08:34] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: if you're not going to be accessing a windows drive from ubuntu in the near future, comment that line out.
[08:34] <CarCase928> hello, i can't get an MIDI file to play, an error message saying that the sequencer is being used by another app appears when i attempt to play the MIDI file, using KMid to open the MIDI file.
[08:35] <Stanislav> i figured out what sdc was.. my Ipod lol
[08:35] <kling0n> ArrenLex:  you might be right about the alsa-oss
[08:35] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: do you actually HAVE a hardware midi sequencer?
[08:35] <macogw> i went to the one the ubotu thing said and it says i have a later one installed.  that one is found here http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/dists/dapper/3v1n0/ (yeah, replace dapper with edgy if needed, scroll down)
[08:35] <CarCase928> my sound card has a built in MIDI sequencer
[08:35] <CarCase928> i think
[08:36] <Stanislav> Aaron what do i do after fstab is okay?
[08:36] <floating> sky123: did you post the zOrks broadcom driver installation to ubuntu forum ?
[08:37] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, update-grub ArrenLex ?
[08:37] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: a) my name is Arren, b) save and close out of it, and then sudo update-grub
[08:37] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: yeah
[08:37] <sky123> floating: nope..havent done so..but.. it does surely work!
[08:37] <Stanislav> sorry about the name and okay did that.
[08:37] <sky123> floating: is it up there already??
[08:38] <floating> yea. I forgot to mention about errorm essages I got
[08:38] <floating> perhaps they should be mentioned when uploading it.
[08:38] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: My sound card should have a bbuilt in MIDI sequencer, it works fine when i'm on windows
[08:38] <floating> so need manual editing I guess.. or i donno
[08:38] <sky123> floating: I would post those up...so he can debug that..
[08:38] <Stanislav> is there anything else ArrenLex or Jordan_U?
[08:38] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: then ... wait. Paste the output of   sudo fdisk -l | grep "*"    please. I'm pretty sure I already know the answer but making sure will save lots of trouble.
[08:38] <floating> sky123: Ill put you priv msg about
[08:39] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: I don't know, sorry; I've always been happy with Timidity++. I'm not much of a midi guy.
[08:39] <sky123> floating: that was pretty nice of him to contribute that..and brave of us to ginuea pig it :P
[08:39] <bcroq>  hello all
[08:39] <floating> yup :)
[08:39] <Stanislav> says cannot open /proc/paritions
[08:40] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: doh, sorry... sudo mount /proc
[08:40] <diminthedam> hello. how do i tell my NetworkManager to search for other networks only when disconnected?
[08:40] <bcroq> I have a strange problem here on my Edgy KDE desktop: when I type (for example here in konversation) the keyboard layout is AZERTY but when I want to use a shortcut (for example ctrl+A) the layout is QWERTY !
[08:40] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, bind /proc?
[08:40] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: no problem.  is Timidity++ some kind of software?
[08:40] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: software midi sequencer.
[08:40] <ArrenLex> !timidity > CarCase928
[08:41] <CarCase928> Arrenlex: where do i get it?
[08:41] <Stanislav> ArrenLex: okay it dunno how to paste this besides typing it to you.. but too much.. it found my 2 hard drives but only the first partitions which are both NTFS
[08:41] <sky123> !pastebin > Stanislav
[08:41] <Jordan_U> CarCase928, synaptic / apt
[08:41] <ArrenLex> bcroq: if you open kcontrol, go to Regional & Acc., and to Keyboard Layout, make sure the right one is selected in the left list... qwerty is probably "us" for you
[08:41] <Stanislav> i am on another pc
[08:41] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: from the ubuntu repos!
[08:41] <sky123> ahh

[08:43] <Jordan_U> alvarezp, Hi.
[08:43] <zenmonk> I know I am in the wrong channel, does anyone know if there is a channel for assembly help?
[08:43] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: what "found" only the first two partitions?
[08:43] <alvarezp> I'm looking for info regarding the keyboard description bug in Ubuntu.
[08:43] <alvarezp> In Edgy Eft.
[08:43] <h1v> zenmonk: #asm
[08:43] <cari_tmen_ce> desswqs
[08:43] <Stanislav> Arren here u go http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33084/
[08:43] <Stanislav> does that work?
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Oh! That's what you mean. Okay.
[08:44] <zenmonk> hlv, thanks :)
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Wow that's weird... okay, I guess we'll try the first drive.
[08:44] <h1v> :D
[08:44] <alvarezp> I go "System > Preferences > Keyboard > Layouts > Add...
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: okay, run "sudo grub-install /dev/sda"
[08:44] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, grub-install /dev/sda
[08:44] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: i am new at Linux, how to i Synaptic / apt?
[08:44] <alvarezp> and the right part of the screen it's completely gray.
[08:44] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, In chroot, no sudo needed :)
[08:44] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: synaptic is a program in your menus, apt is a command-line program.
[08:45] <alvarezp> Under Dapper, there was a keyboard painted there, according with the selected geometry.
[08:45] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Oh... I'd forgotten. Yes. Thanks.
[08:45] <CarCase928> oh
[08:45] <Stanislav> it  say sda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive
[08:45] <ArrenLex> ...
[08:45] <alvarezp> So I would appreciate any docs or pointers on this.
[08:45] <xeon111> Question how do i update my dapper drake to edgy eft
[08:45] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: i know how to launch synaptic, but i don't know how to use it.
[08:46] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: how about grub-install (hd0)? Not sure that will work.
[08:46] <Jordan_U> !synaptic | CarCase928
[08:46] <ubotu> CarCase928: synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[08:46] <CarCase928> thanks
[08:46] <Stanislav> why cant we just install it on sdb?
[08:46] <alvarezp> Or.. where can I report a bug?
[08:47] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: 'cause we're putting grub into your MBR right now, so the system finds it when it boots... I think /dev/sda should be where it looks first, but I've never run a system with more than one drive so I've not had this problem.
[08:47] <bcroq> ArrenLex: in the keyboard layouts, I have "France (fr)" and "Anglais U.S. (us)" (I have both because Vegastrike uses US layout)
[08:47] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Shouldn't grub already be installed on the drive? I thought you only had to re write to the MBR when you change the config in lilo?
[08:47] <bcroq> ArrenLex: I have tried removing multiple layouts and the shortcuts now work !
[08:47] <Stanislav> i changed my boot to load the ubuntu HD first.. and grub shows up
[08:47] <mojo> #join swat
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Oh!! That's different. That makes a lot more sense, Stanislav. Then grub-install /dev/sdb
[08:48] <Stanislav> see i did that.. it gives the same error heh
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: in my experience, grub-install /dev/sda installs grub in the MBR.
[08:48] <Stanislav> but grub is already on that drive
[08:48] <ArrenLex> ..I see.
[08:48] <Stanislav> cause it shows up when i start the pc
[08:48] <xeon111> how do i update my dapper drake to edgy eft
[08:48] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: And grub-install (hd0) doesn't work?
[08:48] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, But why does it need installing is my question.
[08:48] <Stanislav> no it doesnt it
[08:48] <ArrenLex> !upgrade > xeon111
[08:49] <Stanislav> sholdnt grub already work? since it is there and we changed the config?
[08:49] <kling0n> ack... flash 9 is crashing also
[08:49] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Isn't ... ... hmm. That's a good question, now that I think about it.
[08:49] <bcroq> ArrenLex: argl, no, it was fixed, it is now broken :(
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: actually Jordan_U is probably right. You might not need to do that. Okay, try rebooting now and see what happens.
[08:50] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, wait.
[08:50] <Stanislav> ok
[08:50] <Stanislav> lol
[08:50] <ArrenLex> xD
[08:50] <Stanislav> xserver now?lol
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Between the two of us, we'll figure it out.
[08:50] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, yes :)
[08:50] <Stanislav> which command for that
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Oh, right. I totally forgot about that. Good save, Jordan.
[08:50] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, type exit
[08:50] <Stanislav> done

[08:51] <ArrenLex> Minity: nvu
[08:51] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: i see a bunch of results, what packages do i need to download to get Timidity to work?
[08:51] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, Then: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /whateverthemountpointis/etc/X11/xorg.conf

[08:52] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: timidity and freepats. They should install whatever dependencies they have automatically from there.
[08:52] <Stanislav> mount point is /ubuntu_install/
[08:52] <Stanislav> right?
[08:52] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: thanks a lot
[08:52] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: Yes, if that's how you made it.
[08:52] <Stanislav> yup i did
[08:52] <Stanislav> okay did that
[08:52] <Stanislav> am i okay to reboot now =P?
[08:52] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: no. xD
[08:52] <Stanislav> hahah
[08:52] <[Nige] > !ati
[08:52] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:52] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: do you know what video card is in this new machine?
[08:53] <Stanislav> i just put a new one today
[08:53] <Stanislav> GeForce 7600 GS
[08:53] <Stanislav> so NVidia =)
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: okay, sudo nano /ubuntu_install/etc/X11/xorg.conf and go to the "driver" line in the "Device" section.
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: in this "Device" section, change the driver to "nv".
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: so it should read     Driver      "nv"
[08:54] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Why?
[08:54] <Stanislav> it already says NV
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: why what?
[08:54] <Atlas95> hello
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: good; then you don't have to change anything.
[08:54] <Bacta> Does the new version of Ubuntu give decent sound on laptops?
[08:54] <Minty> ArrenLex: NVU is it dispo for linux ??
[08:54] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, If it works on the LiveCD then it already is.
[08:54] <Stanislav> it knows its an NVidia
[08:54] <Bacta> the last version didn't work
[08:55] <ArrenLex> Minty: what means this "dispo" you speak of?
[08:55] <Minty> sorry avaialbale as its not in synaptics
[08:55] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: No. The LiveCD autodetects the video card to work without configuration on any system. A normal ubuntu install obviously doesn't.
[08:55] <CarCase928> How do i log in as root?
[08:56] <Stanislav> Anything else I have todo?=)
[08:56] <CarCase928> i forgot how
[08:56] <ArrenLex> Minty: you need to add the universe repo.
[08:56] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: hold on, wait for Jordan_U to answer...
[08:56] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, If you copy an xorg.conf from a running LiveCD then it is the same as will be installed
[08:56] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, I think you can reboot now.
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Really? I wasn't aware of that, but it makes sense. I don't really use LiveCDs much.... okay, sorry to bother you, Stanislav :)
[08:57] <Stanislav> okay rebooting
[08:57] <Stanislav> wish me luck=)
[08:57] <Minty> ArrenLex: sorry have been away from linux for a while, remind me how please
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Minty: I have no idea, I don't use synaptic. Look for a tutorial.
[08:57] <ArrenLex> !synaptic
[08:57] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[08:57] <kud0s> morning
[08:58] <Stanislav> okay grub loading
[08:58] <Stanislav> clicking ubuntu
[08:58] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, My comp is in for repair and I had ( before I broke it ) been living off of a live USB drive on a machine I am not allowed to actually install anything on, so I have learned a lot about LiveCD's :)
[08:59] <Stanislav> Error 22: No such partition =\
[08:59] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Ah, that explains it... I've never ever used a liveCD... I even installed from the textmode one.
[08:59] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Me to, more options :)
[09:00] <BHSPitLappy> hey
[09:00] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: that doesn't sound good... reboot and this time, instead of pressing enter when you highlight the ubuntu entry, press 'e'.
[09:00] <BHSPitLappy> Back in Dapper, bluetooth worked like a breeze for me! Now in edgy, not so much...
[09:00] <Stanislav> okay
[09:00] <BHSPitLappy> Bluetooth device scans now (in any program) don't turn up results
[09:00] <Stanislav> pressed e
[09:00] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: tell me briefly what it says now.

[09:04] <sn00p|> it says fail to open
[09:04] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: Pastebin it, please.
[09:04] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: Oh. Right, it doesn't. I'm tried. Sorry.
[09:04] <Jordan_U> sn00p|, You need to replace <movie> with the path to a movie
[09:04] <sn00p|> I did
[09:05] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: firstly, you're sure the root partition of your ubuntu drive is /dev/sdb2?
[09:05] <Jordan_U> sn00p|, what was the exact command you typed?
[09:05] <Stanislav> isnt that wwhat we mounted?
[09:05] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: Yes it was. Okay.
[09:06] <ubd> how will i install geforce
[09:06] <Spek> Hi everyone. I've got a problem getting Edgy to work with my laptop display. It's running vesa in X right now;  it does display 24bit at correct rez (1280x768) but it redraws windows really slow. How do I get it the right display driver?

[09:06] <ubotu> ubd: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:06] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: there should be text at the bottom telling you how to edit commands. Do you see it?
[09:06] <Stanislav> is the root (hd1,1) correct?
[09:06] <ArrenLex> sn00p: you haven't escaped your spaces properly.
[09:07] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: that's what I'm trying to find out. I'm going to try asking you to change it to root (hd0,0).
[09:07] <kling0n> ArrenLex:  I think I found the issue
[09:07] <ubd> jordan, i did things written there
[09:07] <kling0n> I had set the default depth to 16 in stead of 24 in xorg.conf
[09:07] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: do you see text at the bottom which tells you how to edit those lines? I think it's 'e' or 'c' or something.
[09:07] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, what?
[09:07] <Stanislav> y
[09:07] <Stanislav> ya
[09:07] <ArrenLex> sn00p: before every space in your filename, put a \. Also before every -.
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: press whatever button that is and change that command to read (hd0,0). Then press b to try booting again.
[09:08] <Stanislav> says cannot mount that partition
[09:08] <Stanislav> got it
[09:08] <Stanislav> its 0,1
[09:08] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, nothing happened then either
[09:08] <catalytic> what can i use to mount iso's?
[09:08] <Stanislav> ubuntu is loading
[09:08] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, try (hd0,1)
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: well that was random! Good to hear! It works?
[09:09] <Stanislav> i did=)
[09:09] <Acker> Where to edit the GRUB on Edgy?
[09:09] <Stanislav> i will tell you in a sceond
[09:09] <catalytic> menu.lst
[09:09] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: when it finishes booting, go back to /boot/grub/menu.lst and make that change permanently.
[09:09] <Stanislav> okay
[09:09] <ArrenLex> Sn00p|: you did know that if you type the first few letters of the filename and then press tab, the shell will auto-complete it for you, yes?
[09:09] <catalytic> what can i use to mount iso's?

[09:11] <jfm3> dang. Thorough.
[09:11] <Jordan_U> Stanislav, ArrenLex , goodnight, it was fun working with you :)
[09:11] <catalytic> !smack

[09:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smack - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:11] <Stanislav> see you and thx a lot
[09:11] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Good night! Thanks a ton for all the help.
[09:11] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, I know it doesn't play the file
[09:12] <Stanislav> i am going to bother arren a lil more
[09:12] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, its asking for some joy stick device I dont even have a joystick
[09:12] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: not long... I am very gone very soon.
[09:12] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: It shouldn't matter that you don't have a joystick.
[09:12] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: pastebin whatever it says now.
[09:12] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex, Just have him change the prefs in the GUI.
[09:12] <Stanislav> how do i mount something in root so that anyone can view it?
[09:12] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I don't do changing prefs in the gui, though... I can't help him.
[09:13] <Stanislav> whats the command
[09:13] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: mount -o users,umask=000 /dev/whatever /wherever
[09:13] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, http://pastebin.ca/253937
[09:13] <Kolbo> hello
[09:14] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: First of all, it's not -vo -xv, it's -vo xv
[09:14] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: second of all, your filename is still wrong. Type in "Speed" and then press the tab key to have Bash fill it in for you.
[09:14] <sn00p|> I did
[09:15] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: Oh. Then there are several files with that name but different extensions. What's the extension?
[09:15] <Stanislav> arren for some reason the mounting doesnt work on boot.. i am using NTFS-3g would that need reconfiguring?
[09:15] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: First of all, didn't you take your windows partition out of your fstab?
[09:15] <Stanislav> nah i kept it there
[09:15] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: secondly, I don't know anything about ntfs-3g... sorry.
[09:15] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device.
[09:16] <catalytic> mount: unknown filesystem type 'loop'
[09:16] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: I suddenly notice you're running mplayer is root. Don't.
[09:16] <Spek> Anyone know why OpenGL renders really well but X runs like crap for me?
[09:16] <Stanislav> one more question how would i find the name of my new DVD rom?
[09:16] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, no i'm in my gui
[09:16] <catalytic> is there a gui front end for mounting .iso's?
[09:16] <sn00p|> as well I get the same error when I am logged in as sn00p
[09:16] <kalila> hmm, firefox/galeon etc display .doc document instead of ofering to download them :/
[09:16] <kalila> how to change that?
[09:16] <ArrenLex> catalytic: sorry, that was a typo: -o loop
[09:16] <catalytic> ok, not t
[09:16] <diminthedam> hello, does anyone have any experience with Network-Manager-Gnome here?
[09:16] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: Timidity does not work, i still get the same error
[09:17] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: That's extremely odd. What if you try "/etc/init.d/alsa-utils force-reload"?
[09:17] <ArrenLex> sudo with that, CarCase
[09:17] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: log in as a normal user, run that command, and pastebin the output thnen.
[09:17] <ArrenLex> en.
[09:17] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, suddenly it works
[09:18] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: now try that exact same working command without "-vo xv"
[09:18] <Stanislav> actuallyt nevermind about the CD thing it works now
[09:18] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: I love it when things work by themselves :)
[09:18] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, works too
[09:18] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: i got an error, here it is:  ken@Linux0001:~$

[09:19] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, mplayer must think its still root?
[09:19] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: do that again with sudo
[09:19] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: tell me how you launch mplayer normally.
[09:19] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, from the applications menu while logged in as sn00p
[09:19] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: the gui mplayer?
[09:20] <sn00p|> yea
[09:20] <sn00p|> It was working with dapper when I had it installed
[09:20] <ArrenLex> sn00p|: go to the gui, find where the options are, and make sure your mplayer is using "xv" for the video output driver.
[09:20] <ArrenLex> Well, I really have to go, guys. Hoped I helped some of you out a bit.
[09:20] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: it seems to work, but i still get the same error when i attempt tp play the file
[09:20] <ArrenLex> See you -- enjoy Linux.
[09:20] <CarCase928> to
[09:20] <Stanislav> arren what is proc ? it auto mounts
[09:20] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: paste the command you're trying.
[09:21] <CarCase928> sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils force-reload
[09:21] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: /proc is important system stuff your system can't run without. No touchy.
[09:21] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: no; to play the file.
[09:21] <kling0n> Stanislav:  it is an  interface for some kinds of inter-process communication
[09:21] <sn00p|> ArrenLex, ok it works thanks
[09:21] <BHSPitLappy> Bluetooth device scans now (in any program) don't turn up results. Help?
[09:21] <BHSPitLappy> worked in dapper
[09:23] <ArrenLex> Stanislav: the long, more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know answer to what /proc is can be found, as always, on Wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs
[09:23] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: still won't playu
[09:23] <CarCase928> play
[09:23] <trench-_> what can i install for firefox media plugin?
[09:23] <ArrenLex> CarCase: paste the command you're using to try to play it to me
[09:23] <trench-_> i already have flash
[09:23] <CowzRule> exit
[09:24] <CarCase928> i'm using an app to play the file
[09:24] <Stanislav> which file do i edit again to change grub?
[09:24] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: i'm using an app to play the file
[09:25] <BHSPitLappy> Stanislav, /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:25] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: what's the command to play the file?
[09:27] <sn00p|> anybody know a gui for rar archive manager?
[09:27] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: Timidity IS an app! It itself is a program to play midis. Play midis with timidity.
[09:27] <Spek> Hi everyone. I've got a problem getting Edgy to work with my laptop display. It's running vesa in X right now;  it does display 24bit at correct rez (1280x768) but it redraws windows really slow. It's a gateway laptop with a via chipset. How do I get it the right display driver?
[09:27] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: the app does not appear in the menu
[09:27] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: Yeah. It's a CLI app.
[09:28] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: ALI????
[09:28] <CarCase928> CLI
[09:28] <ArrenLex> CLI. Command Line Interface. Terminal. Text.
[09:28] <ArrenLex> Sorry, man; I really, really gotta go. Good luck!
[09:28] <CarCase928> ArrenLex: How to i play MIDIs with the app?
[09:28] <jfm3> !suspend
[09:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about suspend - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:29] <ArrenLex> CarCase928: by opening a terminal and running 'timidity file.mid'
[09:29] <ArrenLex> or maybe it was 'timidity++ file.mid'
[09:29] <CarCase928> thanks
[09:29] <ArrenLex> One of those
[09:29] <ArrenLex> See you!
[09:29] <CarCase928> bye
[09:29] <kling0n> Spek: what graphics card do you have?
[09:29] <kling0n> and have you tried a lower ersolution?
[09:29] <kling0n> resolution even
[09:30] <Spek> It's on chip, cause it's a laptop. It's a via vt82xx chipset?
[09:30] <Spek> And I'm running at the LCD native rez, 1280x768.
[09:30] <Spek> Tried lower rez, and it makes no difference. The only odd bit is OpenGL renders fine. X is choppy, though.
[09:31] <yalu> hi, should I install libflashplugin-nonfree or flashplayer-mozilla? I don't see the difference
[09:31] <kling0n> Spek do you have a name and model for the laptop?
[09:31] <Spek> yah; gateway mx3230
[09:31] <kling0n> spek, also, try to go to pastebin and dump you /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[09:31] <Spek> will do
[09:32] <Stanislav> Arren any idea how to get my resolution back to 1680x1050 i tried changing the xorg file and reloading but it sticks to 1024x768
[09:34] <Stanislav> any ideas?
[09:34] <Spek> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33087/
[09:36] <Spek> I think it's a unichrome-pro vid. I had a friend who's a *nix guru take a look at it, but we didn't have enough time to finish fixing it
[09:36] <py_> hello
[09:37] <kraut> hi
[09:37] <Lynoure> Stanislav: is your xorg.conf in pastebin somewhere?
[09:37] <kraut> could anybody please tell my, why my CRT in this config won't use 85 hz?
[09:37] <kraut> http://home.packetloss.biz/~fek/temp/xorg.conf
[09:37] <Stanislav> nope
[09:37] <py_> each line of dmesg begins with a number ("[17272182.080000] ") which I believe is a timestamp. How do I translate them into human time to know when things happened?
[09:38] <Spek> I believe that timestamp is from the epoch?
[09:38] <Stanislav> when i try to run dpkg-reconfigure
[09:39] <Stanislav> it says server-xorg is not installed
[09:39] <Stanislav> o.O
[09:40] <kling0n> spek: try commenting out the vesa module?
[09:40] <Spek> Oh? Where do I do that?
[09:41] <Tomcat_> Spek: perl -e "print \"\" . localtime(<timestamp>)" should do it
[09:41] <CarCase928> too bad ArrenLex isn't here, i wanted to tell him that it works, but timidity doesn't have 100% support for MIDI, but it does have partial support for MIDI
[09:41] <Tomcat_> Spek: But I doubt it's a "real" timestamp.
[09:42] <Tomcat_> Spek: Nope, isn't.
[09:42] <xeon111> an one here who can help me enable sound
[09:43] <CarCase928> can anyone tell me how to open a .bin file?
[09:43] <py_> Spek:  also tought so, but it doesn't seem to be that, as date and such utils fail to convert it (or give a wrong date)
[09:43] <Stanislav> why cant i reconfigure my xorg.. it says it doesnt exist =\
[09:44] <KJro> hello ...
[09:44] <thor> CarCase928: you usually don't open a .bin file, you execute it.
[09:45] <MikeyMike> whats the gui rar in ubuntu
[09:45] <MikeyMike> isn't there a gui rar
[09:45] <CarCase928> thor: that's what i'm wanting to do, execute it
[09:45] <KJro> have a question ... i have a name.dxf file and other plain text files whit no extension..  Who could i tell nautilus file manager to start qcad for the dxf and text editor for other files he identifies as plain text files ????
[09:46] <thor> CarCase928: in linux you need to include the path, as linux doesn't handle execution quite like M$. Assuming you are in the same directory as the .bin, just type ./<filename>
[09:46] <p_masho> I'm attempting to use the "dialog" command in a bash script.. but get an error "command not found"... have installed ncurses libs and ideas wats missing please ?
[09:46] <xeon111> any one here who knows how to enable sund
[09:46] <p_masho> >> dialog -title "Start BamBotoo ? "  -yesno "Let me at the channels"
[09:46] <disposable> when will ubuntu get a proper 'menu system' like debian? it's a pain in the arse to use alacarte everytime i install something (mlview, airsnort, kate, freecraft...)
[09:47] <thor> CarCase928: from anywhere else, include the entire path (/home/me/filename)
[09:47] <xeon111> !sound|xeon111
[09:47] <ubotu> xeon111: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[09:47] <Janchi> disposable: what is the problem. In my case all new installs wind up in the menu
[09:47] <Janchi> Ubuntu= Debian
[09:47] <CarCase928> thor: thanks
[09:47] <Amaranth> disposable: Ubuntu does have a 'proper menu system'. It's a freedesktop.org specification and everyone is moving to it.
[09:48] <kamui|srv> Im trying to host a website on my ubuntu system, but outside connections cant connect to it even though I've forwarded ports 80 and 81 to the box, is there some kind of firewall that a standard dapper install installs?
[09:48] <disposable> Amaranth, not a very comfortable system then...
[09:48] <disposable> Janchi, i'm sorry, but if you try any of the packages i listed, they just won't appear
[09:48] <Amaranth> disposable: standards are like that
[09:49] <Amaranth> disposable: You could always enable the debian submenu
[09:49] <tonyyarusso> disposable: You can always get the old debian-style menu if you want
[09:49] <Amaranth> disposable: sudo apt-get install menu-xdg
[09:49] <disposable> Amaranth, tonyyarusso : how?
[09:49] <tonyyarusso> ^^
[09:49] <disposable> just noticed :)
[09:49] <disposable> thanks
[09:49] <KJro> anyone could help me ... ? configure ubuntu to recognize .dxf extension as cad project file ... and open it automaticly whit qcad ???
[09:49] <Stanislav> my add/remove wont start =\
[09:50] <kling0n> Spek: edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[09:50] <tonyyarusso> I have a weird bug - I use Thunderbird, and was able to change the launcher to it, but it won't let me change the text from "Evolution Mail" - it auto-reverts every time
[09:50] <KenSentMe> KJro: right click on the file, properties - open with and choose a standard application
[09:51] <BHSPitLappy> KJro, I'm not sure you can make ubuntu recognize a file by its extension.
[09:51] <kraut> couldn't anybody help me please?
[09:51] <xeon111> any one here who can help me
[09:51] <thor> !ask
[09:51] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:51] <BHSPitLappy> kraut, i don't see a question from you in the past 2 pages, so you're out of luck
[09:51] <xeon111> my sound is not working
[09:51] <kraut> <kraut> could anybody please tell my, why my CRT in this config won't use 85 hz?
[09:51] <kraut> <kraut> http://home.packetloss.biz/~fek/temp/xorg.conf
[09:52] <BHSPitLappy> no clue
[09:52] <kraut> xeon111: i allready did
[09:52] <xeon111> and i have a sound blaster 16 sound card
[09:52] <KJro> that's the problem KenSentME ... the file is categorized as plain text file ... so if i set it to open whit qcad ... he then opens every plain text file whit qcad ...
[09:52] <savvas> how can i compile a c++ or c program in ubuntu?
[09:52] <KJro> i want to make ubuntu understand the difference ... between the .dxf extension and other files
[09:52] <KenSentMe> KJro: hmm, thats strange. I wouldn't know then
[09:53] <KJro> try it... create a file whit .dxf ext and play around (contents of a dxf file is plain text)
[09:53] <CarCase928> thor: i can't get the command to work
[09:53] <Janchi> savvas, did you install gcc and make already
[09:54] <savvas> Janchi: they're already installed :\
[09:54] <thor> CarCase928: do a ls -l and see if the file is marked as executable. Know how to do that?
[09:54] <CarCase928> thor: i'll try
[09:54] <savvas> Janchi: i tried g++ command but it doesn't exist
[09:54] <Luke> savvas: use gcc
[09:55] <xeon111> i m unable to find ur answer please can u give it again i havea sound blaster 16 sound card
[09:55] <Luke> savvas: it wil see its a C++ file and use g++ automatically
[09:55] <crimsun> xeon111: sudo modprobe snd-sb16
[09:55] <thor> CarCase928: the output of 'ls -l', on the left end, will have something like '-rwxrwxrwx', you need the x's

[09:56] <dr-nix> if that doesn't work you can always just do it the long way (aptitute install g++..
[09:56] <CarCase928> thor: i run the command, here is the result: ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$ ls -l /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[09:56] <CarCase928> -rw-r--r-- 1 ken ken 21466938 2006-11-21 00:25 /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[09:56] <CarCase928> ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$
[09:56] <savvas> KJro: right click on the file and use the "open with application"
[09:57] <Nowak> Im missing some basic manuals like socket(2), what package are they in ?
[09:57] <savvas> ok crimsun thanks, it's installing them right now :)
[09:57] <dr-nix> CarCase928: you can read the file but not execute it, try chmod +x /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[09:57] <thor> CarCase928: right....then you need the x's. 'chmod 755 /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin'
[09:58] <cesar_> i dont want to right click on the application, how do i make it just open xmms
[09:58] <cesar_> i doubleclick m3u file and i want xmms to open it, not give me 4 options
[09:59] <Janchi> cesar_: you can also open XMMS and open the m3u that way
[09:59] <KJro> cesar
[09:59] <netnull> hello guys, can anyone help me in installing Cairo dock?
[09:59] <cesar_> but how do i make it so i can just double click the file and have it open in xmms
[09:59] <Stanislav> sigh
[09:59] <thor> cesar_ right click the m3u file in nautilus. Properties-OpenWith
[09:59] <KJro> cesar: you can right click and set the default applicationto start the file whit...
[09:59] <cesar_> i did that
[10:00] <Stanislav> can anyone help me? Add/Remove doesnt load and ubuntu doesnt know what xserver-xorg is
[10:00] <cesar_> and it still asks me if i want to execute it
[10:00] <CarCase928> thor and dr-nix: i ran the command(s), nothing happened
[10:00] <netnull> i've ubuntu edgy
[10:00] <cesar_> i set default application
[10:00] <netnull> with Glx desktop
[10:00] <dr-nix> CarCase928:  if you've done that it should be executable..
[10:00] <thor> CarCase928: do the ls -l again and make sure the file is Now executable
[10:01] <CarCase928> thor: ok
[10:01] <CarCase928> dr-nix: ok
[10:01] <Janchi> cesar_: Ubuntu will do the same with standard text files. The reason is simple: a text file can be a text file or a script. Ubuntu is just being helpful and not make assumptions (like Windows)
[10:01] <KJro> cesar:strange it work good for me ...
[10:01] <cesar_> so how do i make it make assumptions
[10:01] <Janchi> cesar_: an m3u file is the same.
[10:01] <beef__> Hi all.  I've just installed ubuntu and I'm trying to compile something against the linux kernel headers.  They seem to come from the linux-libc-dev package.  But this doesn't include /usr/include/linux/string.h which my app needs.  Regular kernel headers do include this file.  Can anyone recommend how I should get this file?
[10:01] <KJro> cesar:take a loook at your permissions.. maybe file is set for execute
[10:01] <cesar_> it is
[10:02] <cesar_> should i just make it rw?
[10:02] <KJro> cesar: clear execute flag
[10:02] <cesar_> ty
[10:02] <KJro> it worked ?
[10:02] <CarCase928> thor: here is the result: ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$ ls -l /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[10:02] <CarCase928> -rwxr-xr-x 1 ken ken 21466938 2006-11-21 00:25 /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
[10:02] <CarCase928> ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$
[10:03] <netnull> i do this: sudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin librsvg2-common librsvg2-dev libglitz-glx1 libglitz-glx1-dev
[10:03] <CarCase928> thor: "/home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin" is in green
[10:03] <thor> CarCase928: then /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin should run the file
[10:03] <netnull> but i get this error:  librsvg2-dev: Dipende: libgtk2.0-dev (>= 2.8.17-1) cant be installed
[10:03] <netnull> what to do?
[10:03] <KJro> back to my problem: How can i tell ubuntu -> nautilus that .dxf files are not plain text files ???? PLS need someone who knows details.... more then i do ... :D
[10:03] <thor> CarCase928: do you get any output (error indication) when you run that command in a terminal?
[10:04] <CarCase928> thor: it's working, thanks a lot
[10:04] <dr-nix> KJro: yell at it ?!
[10:04] <thor> CarCase928: good. good luck
[10:04] <cesar_> how do i add a panel item that will execute a java jar file?

=== Deaigo324 is now known as Deaigo
[10:05] <dr-nix> hmm that would be intresting to know.. possibly in the share dir?!
[10:05] <netnull> can anyone help me? :(
[10:05] <KJro> whitch is ?
[10:06] <cesar_> i love how my music doesnt skip in ubuntu
[10:06] <dr-nix> /usr/share  think
[10:06] <thor> KJro: the info is stored in the mime types. Don't recall just where that file is, but you need to add a mimetype for dxf files
[10:06] <cesar_> it skips like a horny nun in debian
[10:07] <KJro> thor: hmmm finaly something to start whit
[10:07] <KJro> thx
[10:07] <thor> KJro: I am trying to find my notes on where that file is....I think in /usr/share/something
[10:08] <dr-nix> locate mime ?
[10:08] <dr-nix> then grep usr/share or summn..
[10:08] <guillem101> Does junk detection work by default at evolution? Doesn't seem so to me.
[10:08] <KJro> hmmm i did updatedb .. now i am wating ...
[10:09] <dr-nix> anyways good luck, i need to go (my lecture starts soon)
[10:09] <thor> KJro: I did find a mime type for qcad in /usr/lib/mime/packages
[10:09] <KJro> thor: i found /etc/mime/types
[10:10] <KJro> that is: /etc/mime.types
[10:11] <savvas> KJro: now add that mime type in /etc/gnome/defaults.list
[10:11] <thor> KJro: the mimetype is 'image/vnc.dxf'
[10:12] <thor> KJro: oops...image/vnd.dxf
[10:12] <sanityx> are there any plans for ubuntu to support intel macs?
[10:13] <BHSPitLappy> sanityx, umm, yes.
[10:13] <BHSPitLappy> in the near past.
[10:13] <savvas> :p
[10:13] <sanityx> har har har
[10:13] <BHSPitLappy> (as far as I know, they do. Why wouldn't they?)
[10:13] <sanityx> they boot straight off the disk, no hacks?
[10:13] <BHSPitLappy> you can install XP on them.
[10:13] <BHSPitLappy> and it's not fancied up or anything
[10:13] <sanityx> I know that. Using bootcamp. but bootcamp doesnt support linux
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> what? that jerk
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> well there's got to be some way
[10:14] <sanityx> Seriously though. Can you install ubuntu on an intel mac without having to hack it
[10:14] <savvas> you mean like virtual os?
[10:14] <sanityx> no
[10:14] <sanityx> i mean like a real installation.
[10:14] <sanityx> to the hard drive.
[10:15] <savvas> doesn't the intel x86 work?
[10:15] <Sonderblade> anyone know where wireless-tools-dev(el) can be found?
[10:15] <sanityx> Yes techincally the binaries should run, but since apples use a different type of bios i dont think you can boot right off a regular ubuntu disk
[10:15] <savvas> sanityx: did you try it? :p
[10:16] <tonyyserver> Intel Mac support is being added more sanely as one of the specs for Feisty
[10:16] <jimcooncat> there's a command to set preferred applications, could someone remind me what it is, please?
[10:17] <sanityx> heh, it does work apparently. with a little hacking
[10:17] <thor> jimcooncat: System-Preferences-Preferred Applicatioins
[10:17] <jimcooncat> thanks thor, but I meant the command line one
[10:17] <bliss_> hi
[10:17] <jimcooncat> not the gui
[10:18] <etruscae> is there an easy way to upgrade from server to desktop ubuntu?
[10:18] <Konnektion> apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[10:18] <Konnektion> i think
[10:18] <bliss_> does any body know of a encryiption package thataeasy to use with  dapper
[10:18] <etruscae> does that replace server or just put the desktop packages on server?
[10:19] <Konnektion> puts the xserver and other stuff on the server
[10:19] <jimcooncat> sets symlinks like the "editor" command uses
[10:19] <tonyyserver> bluefox83: What sort of encryption / interface?
[10:20] <thor> bliss_: what are you trying to do? encryption is in the nautilus right click menu
[10:20] <joe74> synaptic is broken on my system, I created a deb from rpm with alien, now I can't upadte or install anything, I can't remove that specific package with even --force switch
[10:21] <joe74> HELP!!! synaptic is broken on my system, I created a deb from rpm with alien, now I can't upadte or install anything, I can't remove that specific package with even --force switch
[10:21] <savvas> thor: are you sure? i don't have that option here
[10:21] <tekton> is there a winamp clone for ubuntu?
[10:21] <savvas> tekton: xmms
[10:21] <burzum> im looking for a programm that displays how strong the receiving of a wlan is, any suggestions?
[10:21] <joe74> tekton, download xmms
[10:21] <tonyyserver> joe74: In the future, don't use rpms
[10:21] <tekton> thanks
[10:22] <thor> savvas: if I right click on a txt file in nautilus I see Encrypt and Sign as choices on the menu
[10:22] <joe74> ok tony, but what to do?
[10:22] <Stanislav> anyone here knowabout NTFS-3g?
[10:22] <thor> savvas: don't recall doing anything other than installiing gpg and tkpgp

[10:22] <joe74> it's completely broken
[10:22] <savvas> thor: well i don't :p
[10:22] <joe74> darn
[10:22] <tonyyserver> thor, savvas those nautilus options are provided by the seahorse package

[10:28] <Bacta> dosn't fix it
[10:28] <mnepton> you may want to restart X
[10:28] <TC`> !nvidia
[10:28] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:29] <Bacta> how do i restart x?
[10:29] <guest_> ctrl alt del
[10:29] <thor> Bacta: ctrl alt backspace...not del
[10:29] <guest_> oops i stand corrected
[10:30] <thor> guest_: del would do it too...but sort of overkill
[10:30] <guest_> first day on this irc, very happy to be in here
[10:30] <thor> guest_: welcome to the madness <smile>
[10:31] <snowshoefox> w00t, recompiled my kernel and my boot-up time is way faster

[10:35] <thor> Bacta: there is a motion_acceleration setting in the right window
[10:36] <thor> Bacta: right click that and choose Edit Key and try a different value
[10:36] <dennister> <---is trying to verify her new udev rule
[10:36] <dennister> or anyone with a lirc.rules file on their system would do
[10:37] <guest_> lots of altruists in here, providing help w/ nothing in return, good show
[10:37] <Bacta> will i need to restart x for it to take effect?
[10:37] <thor> Bacta: not sure about that
[10:38] <rlee> helo
[10:38] <Bacta> well its not doing anything
[10:38] <rlee> does ubuntu support hyperthreading?

[10:41] <arepie> how can i fix this --> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[10:41] <MistaED> rlee: yeah just make sure you have an -smp enabled kernel (by default dapper does not, but you can easily get one via synaptic)
[10:42] <meenfreem> anyone here with browser hijacking experience... better put, how to get rid of it...
[10:42] <guest_> on ubuntu?
[10:42] <guest_> hijackthis.de
[10:42] <MistaED> rlee: -smp supports hyperthreading/multiple cores/etc.
[10:43] <cesar_> does anyone know if its possible to cd to a directory thru a launcher item?
[10:44] <cesar_> i have an executable that will only run if you cd to the directory first
[10:44] <cesar_> i want to make a shortcut i can click on
[10:44] <thor> cesar_: write a small bash script and put it in ~/bin
[10:44] <DarkLinux> rlee: what cpu are u using
[10:44] <meenfreem> Lynoure, you around?
[10:44] <cesar_> thor: ty
[10:44] <cesar_> ~/bin or /bin ?
[10:45] <thor> cesar_: for scripts a user writes you should use ~/bin
[10:45] <thor> cesar_: both are in the PATH
[10:45] <cesar_> ok ty
[10:45] <rlee> darklinux: intel p4 3.06 ht
[10:45] <cesar_> i dont have a bin directory though in my home
[10:45] <DarkLinux> rlee: is it duo
[10:45] <cesar_> how do i check the path that gnome uses/
[10:45] <cesar_> ?
[10:45] <DarkLinux> rlee: u main bus 533
[10:45] <thor> cesar_: 'echo $PATH'
[10:46] <rlee> darklinux: yes it is
[10:46] <martin_> cesar_: If the script is for all the users of your system, I would put it in /usr/local/bin
[10:46] <cesar_> but thats in the terminal right -- what path does gnome use?
[10:46] <DarkLinux> rlee: why not the kernel is new and the cpu is alittle bit old
[10:46] <thor> cesar_: a path is a path is a path, no?
[10:47] <DarkLinux> rlee: it will work fine and brandy
[10:47] <Stanislav> how would i go about making grub boot my windows from another HD? =\
[10:47] <DarkLinux> rlee: anything else
[10:47] <tapoxi> Hi. Lets say I screwed up my UI a little and want to revert back to the default wallpaper/panel layout/settings. Is there any preference file I can delete?
[10:47] <cesar_> thor: does gnome use its own initialization bash scripts? in my .bashrc i have an export LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and i can run what i want in terminal, but not in gnome
[10:47] <rlee> darklinux: i will try it. thanks
[10:47] <cesar_> thats what i mean by "different paths"
[10:47] <DarkLinux> rlee : stay connected
[10:48] <thor> cesar_: ah....ok. I know gnome doesn't use .xinitrc, but didn't know about path
[10:48] <DarkLinux> sweet
[10:48] <DarkLinux> men lets talk
[10:48] <DarkLinux> why the lake of softs in ubuntu cd
[10:48] <cesar_> what does gnome use? cuz i have no idea...
[10:48] <cesar_> if i could just add the aliases there then maybe i don't need to write a script
[10:49] <thor>  cesar_: try putting the PATH= in .gnomerc and see if that works
[10:49] <DarkLinux> its cool cheep fast and frindly the kind of things u need in a date
[10:49] <DarkLinux> so
[10:49] <cesar_> do i have to source .gnomerc?
[10:49] <cesar_> how can i do that within gnome
[10:49] <tapoxi> Can I just wipe all of my dotfiles, or does it install 'default' settings for new users from somewhere?
[10:49] <rlee> DarkLinux: is HT a security threat?
[10:50] <rlee> DarkLinux: I found article say HyperThreading is harmful
[10:50] <thor> cesar_: checking....
[10:50] <cesar_> i think for right now i'll just try putting my script in usr/local/bin
[10:50] <rlee> DarkLinux:http://www.daemonology.net/hyperthreading-considered-harmful/

[10:52] <DarkLinux> rlee: such as what
[10:52] <thor> cesar_: found plenty of references to .gnomerc in google. I think that might be the answer to your problem. But I didn't find an example script
[10:53] <rlee> DarkLinux: it says Ubuntu disable the ht support
[10:53] <sky123> mtyhome: might wanna checkout contribs.org... not ubuntu but very good

[10:54] <thor> cesar_: I don't think .gnomerc is a script...just put the commands you want in a text file...no #!/bin/sh at the start

[10:54] <cesar_> excellent - i got it working
[10:54] <cesar_> yes
[10:54] <cesar_> i just put the commands in a text file, made it executable

[11:10] <tonyyarusso> Wilddraon: You looking for build-essential perhaps?
[11:11] <mamzers555> bimberi; there is another way than sensors i want to try it with conky, also in my panel the cpu-tem is shown, but which module is used?
[11:11] <burzum> digitalmouse search for vnc
[11:11] <Wilddraon> tonyyarusso: yes:
[11:11] <kronos> anyone ?
[11:11] <digitalmouse> oh got that- ubuntu's built in vnc is working nice, and no problem connecting remotely... was just looking for something I can set to boot time and lock down
[11:11] <tonyyarusso> kronos: What's it do when you try?
[11:11] <meenfreem> burzum, see, the thing is, we've got a browser hijack in our system and can't locate it...
[11:12] <bimberi> mamzers555: idk sorry, could be an acpi module but i'm guessing
[11:12] <meenfreem> it even goes cross os now
[11:12] <thor> digitalmouse: if vnc works for you, you can write a script that sets it up and include it at boot in /etc/init.d
[11:12] <Wilddraon> tonnyyarusso: I I am not sure the name of the package: I have seen it somewhere, there was a tutorial of installing it.  the package that includes C++, java, python, and other stuffs
[11:12] <kronos> tonyyarusso: 0% [Connecting to... and that's all, after 2-3 mins gives a 'connection timed out'
[11:12] <bimberi> Wilddraon: eclipse?
[11:12] <mamzers555> bimberi; yes you're right, it is an acpi modul, but do you know how i can use it (especially with conky)?
[11:13] <bimberi> mamzers555: no idea sorry
[11:13] <Wilddraon> bimberi: thanks
[11:13] <mamzers555> bimberi; thanks
[11:13] <bimberi> Wilddraon, mamzers555: np :)
[11:13] <tonyyarusso> kronos: Where does it say it's connecting to?
[11:15] <mamzers555> bimberi; it is the i2c-module that is built into the kernel, do you know something about it?
[11:16] <Wilddraon> bimberi: is there anything else similar to eclipse?
[11:19] <bimberi> Wilddraon: there's anjuta and kdevelop to name 2
[11:19] <bimberi> mamzers555: only what you just told me :)

[11:50] <etruscae> rark: did you check the integrity of the cd
[11:51] <rark> nope let me do that now, what if it's fine?

[11:57] <dfd> hello
[11:58] <dfd> Is someone having problems with unrar-free? It fails to extract every package on my machine. I have to copy them to windows, extract the files and then copy back them to here..
[12:00] <Stanislav> beri just so u know i got it working
[12:00] <Stanislav> thx anyway
[12:00] <Stanislav> good night^_^
[12:01] <blind> dfd: have you tried rar-unfree ?
[12:01] <blind> Rather, unrar-unfree
[12:01] <dfd> uhm I can't find it
[12:02] <blind> me neither :P
[12:02] <blind> what IS that package name..
[12:02] <sokuban> blind: enable multiverse
[12:02] <mypapit> :?
[12:02] <blind> sokuban: it is enabled.
[12:02] <sokuban> blind: odd, one sec
[12:03] <dfd> blind, the package is named unrar-free
[12:03] <sokuban> blind: it is just unrar
[12:03] <blind> dfd: that's the free one ;)
[12:03] <dfd> yeah, right
[12:03] <blind> dfd, get just unrar
[12:03] <dfd> ok
[12:03] <dfd> 7zip doesn't work too uhm..
[12:04] <rark> hi, i'm checking the integrity of a ubuntu cd, how long should it take?
[12:04] <sokuban> dfd: check out p7zip or p7zip-full, I haven't tried either as I don't use 7zip
[12:05] <dfd> yes, p7zip-full in installed
[12:05] <dfd> but when it is trying to extract the files it says 'unsupported method'
[12:05] <bart_> test
[12:05] <blind> test
[12:05] <mypapit> test
[12:05] <sokuban> dfd: Sorry, I don't use 7zip so I don't know >_<
[12:05] <bart_> running linuxmint
[12:06] <sokuban> Anyone know how to get the old dapper bootsplash on edgy?
[12:06] <blind> sokuban: i don't know, but if you find out, let me know? :P
[12:06] <catalytic> is there a way to disable the alt+LMB drag moving windows? or is that only a XFCE
[12:07] <Madpilot> sokuban, I know it's possible, can't remember how to do it
[12:07] <rark> bart_: you're running linuxmint? how is that?
[12:07] <bart_> rark it is nice
[12:08] <mypapit> i tried linuxmint, its just ubuntu with extra codecs
[12:08] <bart_> there is all the codes
[12:08] <sokuban> Madpilot: If at all possible getting into using splashy would be a last resort
[12:09] <Madpilot> sokuban, it's a flag you add to some config file, but I can't rember the flag or which file - sorry
[12:11] <dfd> okay, unrar unfree worked ;-)
[12:11] <bart_> is there someone from denmark
[12:13] <idefix> I think I installed my printer properly but yet it doesn't work.. does anyone have any ideas?
[12:14] <Celldweller> what printer
[12:14] <idefix> HP 710C
[12:15] <Celldweller> what version of ubuntu u using
[12:15] <Celldweller> updating the kernel would probably be a good idea
[12:15] <idefix> 2.6.12-10-386
[12:15] <Celldweller> or get the nwrapper and it takes the windows driver and converts it
[12:16] <Celldweller> hmmm
[12:16] <Celldweller> get 3.6.18
[12:16] <Celldweller> err
[12:16] <Celldweller> 2
[12:16] <Celldweller> i cant type
[12:17] <Celldweller> it'll my internal network card onboard..have a driver for you iim sure it fixed
[12:17] <Celldweller> and EVERYONE has had a problem with thtat
[12:17] <Celldweller> the Broadcom43XX
[12:17] <sheff>  JAVA    1500$
[12:17] <sheff>  JAVA    1500$
[12:18] <sheff>  JAVA    1500$
[12:18] <idefix> Celldweller, what's the command for updating the kernel?
[12:18] <idefix> apt-get update kernel?
[12:18] <sokuban> I think I need the old Xubuntu slash .so file
[12:19] <mnepton> idefix: kernel updates will come automagically.
[12:19] <Celldweller> You all need to get the newest version of ubuntu
[12:19] <Celldweller> and upgrade
[12:19] <Celldweller> instead of full install
[12:19] <Celldweller> thats what you need to do lol its so much easier
[12:19] <Celldweller> thna all the bash shell commands
[12:19] <Celldweller> tho learning is fun
[12:20] <Celldweller> time is money and im ADD so it doesnt work for me unless i have to do it
[12:20] <idefix> I like mneptons automagically remark better
[12:20] <idefix> but, I have the 2.6.12-10-386 version so something didn't go automagically
[12:20] <Celldweller> mnepton i have yet to see that
[12:21] <Celldweller> after 2.6.17
[12:21] <Celldweller> a lot of stuff is installed automatically
[12:21] <mnepton> Celldweller: new kernel builds get pushed all the time. if they didn't, BenC would have nothing to do but smoke cigarettes and play Texas Hold 'Em.
[12:21] <Quinn_Storm> lol
[12:21] <Celldweller> lol
[12:21] <Celldweller> yea but its absolutely stable
[12:22] <Celldweller> i havent had a problem with it once
[12:22] <idefix> mnepton, but I still have version 2.6.12-10-386 so things didn't quite go automagically on my PC
[12:22] <idefix> do they itch?
[12:22] <mnepton> idefix: what version of Ubuntu?
[12:22] <Quinn_Storm> um...ok
[12:22] <idefix> 2.6.12-10-386
[12:22] <mnepton> *muah*
[12:22] <idefix> ancient?
[12:23] <mnepton> idefix: Dapper? Edgy? wha'?
[12:23] <idefix> breezy badger
[12:23] <mnepton> idefix: you'll want to upgrade to Dapper. Breezy backports will be few and far between.
[12:23] <Quinn_Storm> don't even mention Hoary
[12:23] <prower> Hello everyone :> I had wireless working fine up until I ran the security updates for dapper...then madwifi seemed to disappear :< Was it named to something else?
[12:23] <Celldweller> no!
[12:23] <Celldweller> Dapper has way more problems than edgy
[12:23] <idefix> how do I upgrade to dapper the easiest way?
[12:24] <idefix> and the best way :] 
[12:24] <Quinn_Storm> idefix: back up $HOME, get a CD, install the CD, restore $HOME
[12:24] <mnepton> idefix: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:24] <Quinn_Storm> oh yeah dapper-breezy=1
[12:24] <Quinn_Storm> yeah you can dist-upgrade it
[12:24] <Cosmonaut3030> Celldweller: Yeah, but Edgy has/had issues with Xorg. And, you know, that's a real big one.
[12:24] <idefix> mnepton's command works? :o
[12:25] <Quinn_Storm> do a vi /etc/apt/sources.list;:%s/breezy/dapper/g;:wq;sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:25] <Celldweller> yea but soon to be fixed
[12:25] <Quinn_Storm> er...there's probably a more newbie friendly way to explain what I just said
[12:25] <Celldweller> its not en emergency forme
[12:25] <mnepton> Quinn_Storm: an update should grab a new sources.list with the Dapper repos
[12:25] <Cosmonaut3030> Well it's a stable release, this sort of stuff shouldn't happen in stable.
[12:25] <Quinn_Storm> I've *never* had it do that, mnepton
[12:25] <thais> hi
[12:26] <mnepton> Quinn_Storm: we specifically break things for you to give you relief from the rural PA tedium.
[12:26] <Cosmonaut3030> hi
[12:26] <Celldweller> u have to remember that along with the hundreds of other distros
[12:26] <idefix> I still wonder why you help people who are doomed to hell after life
[12:26] <Celldweller> each are derived from a mac daddy so to speak
[12:26] <Quinn_Storm> lol, mnepton
[12:26] <thais> where your country??
[12:26] <Celldweller> there will always be SOMETHING
[12:27] <BDeeJay> hey anyone who know something about ati open source driver and this: libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b ??
[12:27] <Celldweller> im in america
[12:27] <Cosmonaut3030> Celldweller: wtf are you talking about?
[12:27] <thais> im from brasil
[12:27] <Cosmonaut3030> I'm from England.
[12:27] <Celldweller> sorry
[12:27] <idefix> a LOT is being installed
[12:27] <Celldweller> ADD kickin in
[12:27] <Cosmonaut3030> lol, no problem.
[12:27] <idefix> do I need to restart my PC now?
[12:27] <Celldweller> lol
[12:28] <Cosmonaut3030> Does anyone here use KDE? Or a lot of KDE apps? If you do, try looking into dcop
[12:28] <Celldweller> not a kde fan
[12:28] <Cosmonaut3030> KDE>*
[12:28] <Cosmonaut3030> lol
[12:28] <Celldweller> lol
[12:29] <Celldweller> im a gnomer
[12:29] <Cosmonaut3030> don't you find gnome babies you?
[12:29] <Quinn_Storm> gnome doesn't baby people, it locks them up in a little gnome-themed prison
[12:29] <Cosmonaut3030> with all the simplicity?
[12:29] <Celldweller> lol
[12:29] <apokryphos> Cosmonaut3030: no trolling please
[12:29] <Cosmonaut3030> Quinn_Storm: lol
[12:29] <Cosmonaut3030> apokryphos: I'm not trolling. I'm asking questions.
[12:29] <Celldweller> lol thats why u make your own
[12:30] <Celldweller> KDE never worked on my system right
[12:30] <Celldweller> i was using fedora for a while
[12:30] <Cosmonaut3030> What were the issues you had?
[12:30] <Celldweller> with both installed so i could choose my session
[12:31] <Celldweller> seemed like KDE was fuckin up my computer
[12:31] <Cosmonaut3030> how?
[12:31] <Celldweller> apparently when it got updated
[12:31] <apokryphos> #kubuntu is good for KDE-related support :)
[12:31] <Celldweller> it caused shit to happen in the kernel
[12:31] <rosen37> How to start a ssh-add for all user ? I was using debian and put it in the .xsession but this is not working on xfce ?
[12:31] <Celldweller> and i couldnt even get past the splash screen
[12:31] <idefix> hi, I'm back

[12:32] <idefix> narrowband
[12:32] <Celldweller> burn it
[12:32] <Celldweller> install the upgrade
[12:33] <Cosmonaut3030> KDE messed your kernel? Ok, that's really weird, and seemingly impossible... maybe it was to do with the nvidia/ati driver? (if you had it installed)
[12:33] <mamzers555> if i close audacious after listening some music, my gnome-session crashes. is somebody having this problem too?
[12:33] <Quinn_Storm> if you have a slow connection, talk to shipit.ubuntu.com
[12:33] <Celldweller> it probably was
[12:33] <Celldweller> i do have nvidia
[12:33] <XiXaQ> can I give a user the rights to install new software, but only remove the software he has installed himself?
[12:33] <Celldweller> dell lattitude

[12:36] <luckys> np: [ ()  ] 
[12:36] <Celldweller> and burn it to a cd
[12:36] <Celldweller> and upgrade option is available
[12:36] <Cosmonaut3030> XiXaQ: That's a very complex thing to do... I don't know, try asking on the forums?
[12:37] <CzarAlex> how do I change the SUDO password?
[12:37] <idefix> I don't have a burner
[12:37] <Celldweller> that is the easiest way i can tell you to fix most everything
[12:37] <XiXaQ> CzarAlex, change your sudo users password.
[12:37] <Cosmonaut3030> your sudo password is the user pass. If you mean the actual root password, type sudo passwd
[12:37] <Celldweller> lol
[12:37] <mnepton> idefix: back
[12:37] <Celldweller> my friend is snoring
[12:37] <Celldweller> LOUDLY
[12:37] <idefix> I executed your command
[12:38] <Cosmonaut3030> CzarAlex: your sudo password is the user pass. If you mean the actual root password, type sudo passwd. if you mean the user pass, just type passwd
[12:38] <mnepton> idefix: i'll inform it's relatives to make funeral arrangements
[12:38] <CzarAlex> Cosmonaut3030 Gotcha. Thank you.
[12:38] <Cosmonaut3030> No problem.
[12:38] <idefix> I ran your command?
[12:39] <Cosmonaut3030> idefix: what command was it?
[12:39] <idefix> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:39] <Cosmonaut3030> And?
[12:39] <Cosmonaut3030> I cannot see why people ever use sudo... grr, especially for apt
[12:39] <Celldweller> it idnt fix his problem
[12:40] <Celldweller> lol
[12:40] <yeager> lol
[12:41] <Cosmonaut3030> do i get food, watch anime, stay here or play WoW?

[12:42] <Celldweller> it recognized it but it never worked
[12:43] <Cosmonaut3030> idefix: DVD or CD?
[12:43] <Celldweller> i went through a HELLA lotta command before that bitch started working
[12:43] <Quinn_Storm> you almost have to use ndiswrapper for bcm4318
[12:43] <Quinn_Storm> other bcm43xx might work
[12:43] <Celldweller> damn
[12:43] <Cosmonaut3030> Wireless is the bane of my life, fullstop.
[12:43] <idefix> I remember copying my logbook to a 3,5 inch disk and people were rotf-laughing about it

[12:43] <reelart> I have fuckedup my Winxp on laptop trying to install ubuntu. Now I want to recover XP. But in the recovery console XP asks for password. there was no password for my WinXP. Is there a way out?
[12:43] <Quinn_Storm> broadcom, wireless chipset
[12:43] <Celldweller> its onboard  right
[12:43] <highneko> Celldweller: Why so many newlines?
[12:44] <Celldweller> the airforce one
[12:44] <Quinn_Storm> the 4318 is also in lots of minipci cards
[12:44] <Quinn_Storm> like in mine
[12:44] <Cosmonaut3030> And in my Thinkpad :p
[12:44] <Celldweller> im used to typing that way
[12:44] <Celldweller> and i have add
[12:44] <Quinn_Storm> I have an inspiron b130 myself
[12:44] <Celldweller> so i have an excuse ;-)
[12:45] <Quinn_Storm> $500 laptop
[12:45] <highneko> o
[12:45] <highneko> k
[12:45] <Celldweller> lattitude here
[12:45] <Cosmonaut3030> 500 laptop :p
[12:45] <Quinn_Storm> so....about $1,000 laptop then, Cosmonaut3030
[12:45] <Cosmonaut3030> Yeah. Sucks, because we pay VAT, so it's probably around $875
[12:45] <mnepton> Celldweller: his point is well taken. please do not use <return> as punctuation.
[12:45] <Celldweller> ours was like 1499 when we got it
[12:45] <Celldweller> k
[12:45] <Quinn_Storm> I thought the pound was about $2
[12:45] <Cosmonaut3030> Lol.
[12:45] <highneko> mnepton: lol
[12:46] <mnepton> thanks
[12:46] <Quinn_Storm> has it gone down?
[12:46] <Cosmonaut3030> No, it's about $2.
[12:46] <CzarAlex> Is there a command to list the largest files on your system? Almost over night, ive gone to having 98% of my disk filled and i cant figure out what file(s) are doing it.
[12:46] <RichB> Google says: UK 2 = 3.7916 US$
[12:46] <idefix> pybe and the DVD's themselves?
[12:46] <pybe> CzarAlex cd / then run du -sh
[12:46] <Quinn_Storm> ok so the ...compose key failed... is about $1.5 then
[12:46] <Cosmonaut3030> Except we pay Value Added Tax on everything we buy. So, a $1000 laptop, becomes 500+17.5%
[12:47] <Quinn_Storm> well yeah but consider what you get for that
[12:47] <Quinn_Storm> I'd gladly pay VAT for national health-care
[12:47] <dalyr> hey, i just installed ubuntu, everything went fine, but now i cannot log into windows, i get "windows did not start properly last time" message. if i try normal or safe mode my comp reboots. the only thing i can think of is that i didn't close windows down properly before installing windows. can anyone give me a few pointers?
[12:47] <krupa^> hey i very newbie in linux, i want to download ubuntu with graphical interface, what should i download? the newest Ubuntu release / Ubuntu with long-term support ... or other?..

[12:49] <Qy> I'd like to edit an existing video file (cut in parts, flow over with effects and such), could someone suggest me a application?
[12:49] <CzarAlex> pybe thanks!
[12:49] <Cosmonaut3030> I was planning on moving to America when i got older in some attempt to get a nice comp-sci related job.
[12:49] <Cosmonaut3030> However, I'd prefer to stay in Europe... you have very different culture to us.
[12:49] <pybe> CzarAlex NP
[12:49] <Cosmonaut3030> And laws.
[12:49] <Quinn_Storm> true
[12:50] <deep__> any good Direct Connect clients in linux?
[12:50] <Cosmonaut3030> The whole 21 drinking age is insane.
[12:50] <Quinn_Storm> there's one law I would never give up...well its really two...the freedom of speech/assembly, and the freedom from religion
[12:50] <deep__> Preferly Qt ones
[12:50] <deep__> :)
[12:50] <Quinn_Storm> yeah the drinking age thing *is* insane
[12:50] <Khamael> can`t openoffice save microsoft office databases?
[12:50] <Publio> we can own guns in American and protect our personal property ;)
[12:50] <Cosmonaut3030> It's 18 here, but most people start drinking 14-16 and no one really cares.
[12:50] <Quinn_Storm> its 21 here but most people start drinking 14-16 and no one really cares :-P
[12:50] <Cosmonaut3030> Haha.
[12:51] <idefix> Cosmonaut is in his 30s man
[12:51] <Cosmonaut3030> I am?
[12:51] <dalyr> is there any chance of getting some help here?
[12:51] <Quinn_Storm> I'd be fine with lowering the drinking age myself (I'm also *for* legalizing all "drugs"), but I'd want *HEAVY* penalties for any kind of DUI
[12:51] <Cosmonaut3030> dalyr: None at all. Yeah, of course...
[12:51] <Quinn_Storm> like...minimum 1 year in jail
[12:51] <Cosmonaut3030> Driving under the Influence?
[12:51] <Quinn_Storm> yeah
[12:51] <dalyr> will i explain again?
[12:51] <Cosmonaut3030> Please go on dalyr
[12:51] <Quinn_Storm> its just too easy to hurt/kill someone else that way
[12:51] <Celldweller> im trying out xchat... i have lost irc.... so its a wee different  what am I supposed to hit to send a friggen message
[12:52] <Cosmonaut3030> Yeah. I'm agreeing with you there. And the drug legalisation.
[12:52] <dalyr> hey, i just installed ubuntu, everything went fine, but now i cannot log into windows, i get "windows did not start properly last time" message. if i try normal or safe mode my comp reboots. the only thing i can think of is that i didn't close windows down properly before installing ubuntu. can anyone advise me how to get windows loading again?
[12:52] <Celldweller> drugs should be legal... then violence would decrease dramatically
[12:52] <Cosmonaut3030> However, in the US, you'd need heavy taxing on those drugs to pay for stuff, or higher taxes.
[12:52] <Quinn_Storm> well yeah I'd tax the drug sales just like other drugs
[12:53] <Celldweller> you mean like our prescription drugs?
[12:53] <Quinn_Storm> no I mean like alcohol/tobacco
[12:53] <idefix> ok, so if burn the iso to CD how then do I run it?
[12:53] <Celldweller> lol i was making a joke ... no one caught it
[12:53] <Cosmonaut3030> dalyr: can you run chdisk?
[12:53] <Cosmonaut3030> yeah, to u-o
[12:53] <Celldweller> half of america is on Xanax or valium and narcotic pain killers
[12:54] <wiking> how to enable/configure openal
[12:54] <dalyr> how would i run chdisk?
[12:55] <Celldweller> at your command prompt
[12:56] <Celldweller> hey cosmo...sending a message in xchat... without return... what is it
[12:56] <dalyr> can it be run in ubuntu?
[12:56] <Celldweller> different shell and it wouldnt fix your widows problem
[12:57] <dalyr> i can't log into windows at all, i just get the "windows did not shutdown properly last time" message
[12:58] <dalyr> then it reboots when i pick any of the options e.g. safe mode, normal mode
[12:58] <Celldweller> did u install linux before windows
[12:59] <dalyr> no, after
[12:59] <vwirem> How can i find the reason why a package is being "kept back" during apt-get upgrade?
[12:59] <Celldweller> what version
[01:00] <pybe> vwirem try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:00] <dalyr> i didn't shut down windows properly before installing ubuntu. maybe the error message is trying to load windows from the wrong location?
[01:00] <MikeyMike> has anyone ever tried to run ARES under wine? i got it to work
[01:01] <vwirem> pybe, still there are some packages that are being kept back
[01:01] <MikeyMike> but...... whenever i type in the search box... it just comes up as SQUARES in the actual search
[01:01] <Celldweller> possible
[01:01] <dalyr> i will try the xp recovery console
[01:01] <pybe> vwirem try sudo apt-get -f install
[01:01] <Celldweller> brub took over your boot now so you have no window options
[01:02] <Celldweller> im not so sure that's a good idea
[01:02] <Celldweller> u may have to reinstall ubuntu also

[01:05] <Celldweller> different desktop environment different applications
[01:05] <PhibreOptix> When I leave it idle for about an hour it will either Freeze or restart
[01:05] <PhibreOptix> Anybody know why?
[01:05] <Belboz99> the dang thing locks up the entire system, can't even kill it or the GUI for that matter, only solution is to do a hard reset
=== Hit3k_ is now known as Hit3k

[01:06] <aseveremercy> and are you going to completely run linux on the computer?
[01:06] <PhibreOptix> Anybody?
[01:06] <Celldweller> i think it is....
[01:06] <Celldweller> and probably not
[01:06] <Celldweller> Phiber
[01:06] <Celldweller> change your preferences
[01:07] <Belboz99> PhibreOptix: what version of Ubuntu and what CPU do yo have?

[01:07] <Celldweller> ok well im not in lost irc so tell me how to send a friggen message without the enter key...
[01:08] <Belboz99> well, I haven't heard of any software issues that would cause that between that version and that CPU PhibreOptix
[01:08] <Belboz99> PhibreOptix: I'd be looking into hardware issues, specifically RAM and the IDE chains
[01:09] <Celldweller> possibly update his kernel
[01:09] <PhibreOptix> Well
[01:09] <PhibreOptix> I'm new to all this
[01:09] <Belboz99> PhibreOptix: seeing as how it's a problem with being left alone, it may be your advanced power managent settings  in your BIOS are conflicting with Ubuntu, I've seen this before as well\
[01:09] <PhibreOptix> Alright
[01:09] <PhibreOptix> I'll go look at my BIOS then
[01:10] <Belboz99> PhibreOptix: try disabling any Advanced Power management settings in your BIOS
[01:10] <Belboz99> so, anyone know why Cedega locks up Ubuntu-64 entirely, leaving a hard reset as the only solution?
[01:11] <Belboz99> I can't even get past the Licence Agreement page :(
[01:12] <soundray> Belboz99: is Cedega even meant to be 64bit compatible?

[01:24] <Celldweller> isnt that spanish tho
[01:24] <devil_> anyone help me?
[01:24] <soundray> AlbertII: you probably have an application that hogs/leaks memory. Find out what it is with gnome system monitor
[01:25] <Celldweller> depends whats goin on
[01:25] <Celldweller> but im sure that someone can help
[01:25] <AlbertII> it isn't installed
[01:25] <devil_> compiz and aiglx
[01:25] <pybe> aseveremercy; ask the question
[01:25] <soundray> AlbertII: also, configure swap space -- your machine will then slow down first before processes are killed
[01:25] <soundray> AlbertII: use top then
[01:26] <devil_> i have an ATI X800 PCIexpress
[01:26] <Celldweller> devil not my area lo siento
[01:26] <devil_> ok
[01:26] <Celldweller> mnepton

[01:28] <aseveremercy> pybe, does that make any sense?
[01:28] <pybe> aseveremercy; the script is calling /bin/sh which for some reason it doesnt like
[01:28] <Celldweller> no
[01:28] <kud0s> Im having a problem with vsftp, I want to chown all files that are uploaded to become owned by my FTP user, if and how is this possible?
[01:28] <Celldweller> yea it dont make sense
[01:29] <pybe> aseveremercy; whats it doing
[01:29] <aseveremercy> oh -- might i not have /bin/sh working? which sh produces /bin/sh
[01:29] <aseveremercy> (i am trying to install matlab)
[01:29] <pybe> kud0s; look in /etc/vsftpd.conf
[01:29] <pybe> aseveremercy; what does which sh gove you?
[01:30] <kud0s> pybe> i have, alkl i can do is chown all _anonymous_ files to be owned by my ftp user, i want all files to be owned by my ftp user

[01:30] <aseveremercy> root (please see prompt above)
[01:31] <pybe> ahh yes
[01:31] <Celldweller> dadgum alarm clock
[01:31] <Celldweller> scared the poo outta me
[01:31] <MacSlow> Greetings everybody!
[01:32] <pybe> aseveremercy; its weird, other than trying the help for matlab I dont know.
[01:32] <Celldweller> lol someone took their prozac early
[01:32] <Celldweller> whats up macslow
[01:32] <MacSlow> Does somebody know by heart which kernel-version the alternate install-CD of Edgy Eft uses?
[01:32] <aseveremercy> it really stumps me
[01:32] <pybe> kud0s; there is an option, have you tried searching the man page
[01:32] <Celldweller> 2.6.17
[01:32] <Celldweller> or 11 i think
[01:33] <MacSlow> hm... that will then probably not fix my problem
[01:33] <kud0s> ill have a look, duh
[01:33] <Celldweller> whats the prob
[01:33] <MacSlow> I'm currently unable to install 6.10 on that sata-only laptop (all intel hardware)
[01:33] <scheuri> MacSlow: out of curiosity....dapper worked?
[01:34] <MacSlow> Celldweller, see http://macslow.thepimp.net/?p=90 or https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/72631
[01:34] <MacSlow> scheuri, no... it's a naked/fresh laptop
[01:34] <Celldweller> dapper bad
[01:34] <Celldweller> edgy good
[01:34] <Celldweller> lol
[01:34] <scheuri> MacSlow: let me rephrase my question....have you tried with dapper?
[01:35] <scheuri> Celldweller: wroooooooong...;)...at least I can not agree
[01:35] <MacSlow> it's some sata/ICH6/ahci issue in the 2.6.17 kernel (e.g. FC5's 2.6.15 works perfectly with this laptop... at least sata-wise)
[01:36] <scheuri> MacSlow: well then, either make your own InstallCD, wait for Debian 4.0, wait for Feisty or use dapper...:)
[01:36] <MacSlow> scheuri, not yet... because it feels not logical to do so... but I can give it a try
[01:36] <Celldweller> hmm
[01:36] <scheuri> MacSlow: you just said...2.6.17 troubles...2.6.15 fine....dapper uses the latter
[01:36] <pressenter> Good afternoon.
[01:37] <Celldweller> the new slackware is coming out soon isnt it?
[01:37] <vilde> uh..
[01:37] <scheuri> MacSlow: but hey...I am just wild guessing here
[01:37] <pressenter> Anybody ever heared of ubuntu starting up about 25 minutes?
[01:37] <Celldweller> lol
[01:37] <Celldweller> no
[01:37] <scheuri> pressenter: on an old comapq proliant with RAiD 15? sure enough...;)
[01:37] <Celldweller> unless u have a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery slow computer
[01:38] <MacSlow> scheuri, well sure... but as everybody knows... distros put in their own bunch of patches... so one cannot savely assume "FC5's 2.6.15 is working, thus Dapper's 2.6.15 will work too then"
[01:38] <pressenter> scheuri: Athlon 1800, 1gb ram.
[01:38] <scheuri> MacSlow: I would NEVER dare to say such a thing...that is why I said I am wild guessing and "try it"...it may, but may not work
[01:38] <Celldweller> MacSlow
[01:39] <Celldweller> try what scheuri says
[01:39] <scheuri> pressenter: have you checked your logs?
[01:39] <Celldweller> tho it makes no sense to me
[01:39] <scheuri> pressenter: such as bad devices? bad sectors? fschk? whatever
[01:39] <gilnim> hi - my ubuntu doesn't boot - neither single-user nor normal. it stops at the point where it detects the usb-devices?
[01:39] <Celldweller> but its worth trying
[01:40] <scheuri> gilnim: have you any usb devices attached to your PC?
[01:40] <pressenter> scheuri: Lol, forgot, checking right now.
[01:40] <gilnim> yes
[01:40] <scheuri> gilnim: then an advice for FREE....unplug ALL of them and try again
[01:40] <Celldweller> lol
[01:40] <gilnim> without keyboard and mouse it's pretty hard to run a system :)
[01:41] <cmweb> Good morning, ljl, if your on can you tell me how to start the mysql server?
[01:41] <scheuri> gilnim: are those the only one?
[01:41] <Celldweller> guess u had better go to walmart
[01:41] <gilnim> i' gonne run around and take some keyboards and mice from the servers
[01:41] <Celldweller> there ya go
[01:41] <scheuri> gilnim: try without mouse, and with keyboard only first...
[01:42] <scheuri> gilnim: or that...aye

[01:42] <gilnim> isn't there a log that tells me whats going on?
[01:42] <scheuri> cmweb: are you familiar with the CLI?
[01:42] <scheuri> !CLI
[01:42] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[01:42] <Celldweller> ok that didnt work
[01:42] <scheuri> gilnim: there are tons of logs....telling you everything
[01:42] <Celldweller> i liked the aye... where ya from scheuri
[01:42] <cmweb> wo, uh YEAH
[01:43] <gilnim> scheuri, i know, but which log is it?
[01:43] <scheuri> Celldweller: Switzerland...sorry to disappoint you, mate...;)

[01:50] <scheuri> Celldweller: by the way...have I offended you in any way?
[01:50] <justin_> Celldweller: No, but this one looks a lot more informational :) -- thnx

[01:52] <pip> hello
[01:52] <cmweb> Besides this i need access to root can any one help me chaange password
[01:52] <alluc> soundray: I first tried to solve the problem using this page: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA, it's still in my repositories, it worked and at the reboot, didn't work again, now I'm install the linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic as you suggested
[01:52] <soundray> cmweb: no you don't. Use sudo -i
[01:53] <justin_> deep__: :)) What do you mean wrong? Perhaps you could try another distro.. if you do not like the default Ubuntu..
[01:53] <MacSlow> argl.... Dapper is even worse regarding the sata-issue :/
[01:53] <pip> I am installing ubuntu6.06 now, but the partition tool can not recognize the exist partitions on my hard disk ,any ideas ?
[01:53] <MacSlow> damn
[01:53] <Cymage> deep__, rather than saying hw ubuntu is wrong, why not say what is happening and someone might be able to help you
[01:53] <Celldweller> lol
[01:53] <pip> it said "no root partition specified"
[01:53] <pip> so strange
[01:53] <soundray> alluc: after that, if it still doesn't work, try 'sudo modprobe nvidia' and restart X. If that helps, add nvidia to /etc/modules
[01:54] <pip> But I have specified a root partition
[01:54] <justin_> pip: Get EDGY... Dapper has known problems with partitions/install -- problems should be fixed in 6.10.
[01:54] <Celldweller> what partition tool
[01:54] <deep__> dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 8319 package `language-pack-gnome-gd'
[01:54] <Celldweller> edgy good dapper not so much

[01:54] <deep__> I dont even have that language-pack installed. :S
[01:55] <soundray> alluc: '(echo ; echo nvidia) | sudo tee -a /etc/modules'
[01:55] <pip> you mean all 6.06 distro have that problem
[01:56] <justin_> pip: It could but like I said --- 6.06 has some known problems with installation.. you could try -- but you could lose your other info on disk, so I would either wait --- or take a risk :P
[01:56] <pip> justin_, if you have any idea to deal with that problem ,that 'll be better
[01:56] <Belboz99> Hey all, anyone know how to get Cedega running on Ubuntu-64 6.10?
[01:56] <deep__> That does it, im back to windows.
[01:56] <deep__> Bye everyone.
[01:56] <pip> justin_, thanks
[01:56] <soundray> deep__: what do you have to do to get that error?
[01:56] <justin_> pip: Yes all dapper's have problems with install and certain partitions -- let me find you some information on the issues
[01:56] <justin_> deep__: Clean your cache
[01:56] <alluc> soundray: ok thanks :) (even if I don't understand this syntax)
[01:56] <justin_> sudo apt-get clean
[01:57] <alluc> soundray: s/even/although/
[01:57] <soundray> alluc: in English, generate an empty line; generate a line containing the string 'nvidia' and append them to the file /etc/modules with root rights.
[01:57] <deep__> justin_:  still the same. reboot to windows, brb.
[01:58] <justin_> pip: Describe your problem again in detail please so I can find detailed information -- because partition problems are pretty broad ;)
[01:59] <alluc> soundray: ok I see now thanks a lot :D
[02:00] <justin_> deep_ Try adding more repos to your software lists, because sometimes you will not be able to get a connection -- and it will say that, samething happened to me when I wanted to install Bitchx.

[02:06] <cappiz> is the limit of max 2 users for freenx a new thing?

[02:09] <alluc> soundray: I rebooted many times, it changes nothing
[02:10] <soundray> alluc: is the module really absent? Try "ls  /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko"

[02:27] <cantinflas> alluc: in what application? open-ssh? and if so... where do i find it?
[02:28] <alluc> cantinflas: in the ftp application on mac
[02:28] <cantinflas> alluc: but i never setup a login for the ssh... is it the same as my main login for my computer?
[02:29] <alluc> cantinflas: yes it is
[02:30] <cantinflas> alluc: it worked! thank you!
[02:30] <martin_> where is the bootsound located
[02:30] <alluc> cantinflas: cool :)
[02:30] <pybe> mtlife; the file mybackup.tgz would have been created in the "current" directory. create a temporary dir and COPY the tgz into it, then do tar xzvf mybackup.tgz which will unpack the dirs into the current dir. you can then replace individual files/configs etc etc
[02:30] <gordonjcp> hello
[02:30] <martin_> this one which is played when gnome starts
[02:30] <soundray> alluc: this is a strange problem. The fact that modprobe searches for nvidia.ko in the volatile directory means that at one point, the modules must have been there.
[02:31] <gordonjcp> quick and slightly silly question - I upgraded Dapper to Edgy
[02:31] <gordonjcp> now nearly every time I go to install -dev packages I get something along the lines of
[02:31] <dandoc> hi all !
[02:31] <gordonjcp>   libfaac-dev: Depends: libfaac0 (= 1.24clean-0ubuntu4) but 1.24+cvs20060416-0.1 is to be installed
[02:31] <gordonjcp> do I need to flatten and reinstall?
[02:32] <alluc> soundray: should I reinstall edgy ?
[02:32] <pybe> gordonjcp: try apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:32] <soundray> alluc: that's a possibility, although it's normally nicer to understand and solve a problem...
[02:33] <martin_> gordonjcp, maybe you'll have to run apt-get -f install before
[02:33] <gordonjcp> pybe: tried that, but I'll try it again
[02:33] <gordonjcp> martin_: haven't tried that
[02:33] <martin_> does anyone know where the startup sound of gnome is related
[02:33] <martin_> related = located
[02:33] <pybe> gordonjcp; martins suggestion is good
[02:33] <dandoc> is someone can help me : I do a command "beryl" in Terminal and I don't have windows decoration anymore : what should I do ?
[02:34] <gordonjcp> martin_: same result when I try with apt-get -f install
[02:34] <soundray> gordonjcp: have you done a 'sudo apt-get update' recently?
[02:34] <Zaggynl> martin_, /usr/share/sounds
[02:34] <gordonjcp> soundray: yes
[02:34] <gordonjcp> (just before I did apt-get dist-upgrade, in fact)
[02:34] <pybe> gordonjcp; do you need that libfaac-dev?
[02:35] <gordonjcp> well, yes
[02:35] <gordonjcp> on the basis that cinelerra requires it
[02:35] <martin_> thanks Zaggynl
[02:35] <Zaggynl> You're welcome.
[02:35] <soundray> alluc: you haven't disabled anything in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common -- have you?
[02:36] <dandoc>  On ubunutu, I don't have windows decoration anymore : it exist a command line for that ?
[02:36] <dandoc> gdm ?
[02:36] <mtlife> pybe: tx saved that line :)
[02:37] <alluc> soundray: no, I haven't, I don't think so
[02:37] <defrysk> dandoc, to start beryl you need to key in beryl-manager in your console
[02:37] <soundray> dandoc: probably metacity has crashed. Try starting that
[02:37] <defrysk> dandoc, also you need to adjust your sources.list
[02:37] <alluc> soundray: I'm in Gnome under vesa driver right now
[02:37] <defrysk> I mean xorg.conf , sorry
[02:38] <dandoc> defrysk: soundray : thx
[02:38] <floating> Hello. If I want to boot ubuntu and continue where I left with firefox. Is there a neat way to reboot, saving the session only for the one boot, and save it to anything concrete ?

[02:38] <RiGLEY> I need some help with gparted.  http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/3310/screenshotdevhdagpartedrb0.png  How can I extend hda1 to the unallocated space? Move/Resize controls are disabled in the menu.
[02:38] <floating> and not save it... save session for this one reboot
[02:38] <mtlife> floating: search the firefox extensions, session manager
[02:39] <floating> mmmh,. how about a linux property, if I want to include terminal window or such ?
[02:39] <floating> or lets say,if I tag " save this session for future use" at the boot screen. How can I delete it right away ?
[02:40] <mtlife> floating: sorry cant help you with that, still searching for that function myself.. but it is in it somewhere.. ask someone else here..
[02:41] <floating> I havent yet tried it, because i am afraid that the session is saved somewhere and somewhere else and it leave somee "useless files" as I want to keep it clean n all
[02:42] <gordonjcp> pybe: I may be able to compile without it, looking at the configure options

[03:20] <soundray> I have a drive that after days of running starts to throw DriveReady SeekComplete errors, causing filesystem corruption. Is it worth looking for a fix?
[03:21] <hydro> hello
[03:22] <kmaynard> soundray, i'd replace it
[03:22] <jbroome> and start backing stuff up now
[03:22] <kmaynard> soundray, even if you find a fix, would you ever really trust that drive again?
[03:23] <Khamael> is ssh on by default? and is it normal to have an ssh-agent running?
[03:23] <jrib> Khamael: no; I don't know
[03:23] <kollontai> #brasil
[03:23] <hydro> I would like to backup my entire Dapper Drake partition (its the only partition on my laptop's internal hard drive) before upgrading to Edgy. I only have with me an external DVD read/writer drive. Can anyone recommend the best way to do this (in case something goes wrong with the upgrade to Edgy then I could restore from DVD a clone of my Dapper install?)
[03:23] <LjL> Khamael: i have /usr/bin/ssh-agent /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /usr/bin/startkde
[03:23] <kud0s> khamael: sudo apt-get install openssh - everything should be set up automatically
[03:23] <hastesaver> Khamael, the server isn't even installed unless you explicitly install it (package ssh or openssh-server)
[03:23] <kmaynard> Khamael, if you installed ssh, then yes, it will run
[03:24] <hastesaver> !backup
[03:24] <ubotu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi

[03:24] <kud0s> oops
[03:25] <LjL> kud0s: invalid command anyway
[03:26] <MarcN> Since edgy, gaim doesn't always want to display the buddy list.  Anyone else seeing that?
[03:26] <soundray> kmaynard: you're right. I'll throw the drive out.
[03:26] <kmaynard> soundray, get your stuff off first :)
[03:27] <kmaynard> soundray, then give it to someone you don't like :-D  i keed....
[03:27] <soundray> kmaynard: good idea, thanks ;)
[03:27] <gordonjcp> hrmm
[03:27] <kmaynard> muahaha
[03:27] <Slifer4> hi
[03:28] <LjL> soundray: i often use that kind of half-broken HDs for mass storage of unimportant stuff. like, to download the Ubuntu CDs to. hm wait, that doesn't sound good =)
[03:28] <soundray> LjL: I know what you mean, though.
[03:29] <soundray> LjL: maybe I'll divide it into lots of partitions, so fs corruption ideally affects only a small part of the disk at a time
[03:31] <Acke_ubu> hey, i installed vista. on the first partition. so grub is gone. I need to install a new bootmanager, can i do that from the livecd? and how would i do that best?
[03:31] <kling0n> sudo dpkg-configure grub?
[03:31] <gordonjcp> ok, reinstalling ubuntu
[03:31] <kmaynard> fun
[03:31] <gordonjcp> why does the installer in edgy say "no root file system"?
[03:32] <LjL> soundray: also depends how it's broken... i just joined, so i didn't follow this. but if, for instance, you have bad blocks concentrated at the end/beginning of the drive, it's often relatively safe (hey, "safe" from the "unimportant data" point of view) to just create one partition that's far from those blocks

[03:56] <jbroome> you untar and run it from the dir.  it's pretty easy
[03:56] <rausb0> Alakazamz0r: okay, but you don't want to tell a newbie how to build firefox 2 from source.
[03:56] <Alakazamz0r> yeah touche
[03:56] <Laosboyme> Sorry just newbie in linux
[03:57] <Laosboyme> ./install
[03:57] <Laosboyme> using tar ball
[03:57] <Laosboyme> i think
[03:57] <gordonjcp> heigh-ho, reboot
[03:57] <gordonjcp> let's see
[03:58] <rausb0> Laosboyme: no. a tar ball is usually a source archive. you have to compile the whole thing. and that has firefox 2 has many build dependencies.

[04:07] <spazer> hi
[04:08] <LjL> ferentEs
[04:08] <soundray> LjL: trying to understand smartctl -A output... what specifically should I look for?
[04:09] <LjL> soundray, it really depends on your drive what values are shown and what they mean... but, most values should be either 255 or 100. look at those that aren't
[04:09] <higi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6X-QuAh20
[04:10] <LjL> soundray: even if some aren't, that doesn't mean much - it depends on which values they are. if the limit is 0, they're probably not too important (but if they're very close to 0, well...) - if the limit is not 0, and you're somewhat close to the limit, that could be an issue
[04:12] <LjL> soundray: or in other words, if you want my opinion, pastebin the output, but i'm far from a SMART guru as well
[04:13] <soundray> LjL: I remember now what I'd done before: 'smartctl -H /dev/hdf' gave me '...test result: PASSED'.
[04:13] <Jjitchina> anyone know anything about memlock and ulimits?
[04:14] <LjL> soundray: yes but that just means that no value has reached the limit (threshold) yet. still, a value that's too low can indicate trouble even if it hasn't passed the limit
[04:14] <trappist> soundray: you also want to look for fluctuating values
[04:14] <LjL> soundray: that's basically just the same thing that your BIOS does at boot (well, if you've selected that option... which you should). useful sometimes, but not exceptionally meaningful
[04:14] <soundray> LjL, trappist: I've pasted -A output to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33118/
[04:14] <LjL> trappist: i've got quite a few of those :\
[04:15] <soundray> trappist: good to see you after a long time
[04:15] <trappist> soundray: hey :)
[04:15] <LjL> well to start with, you have some reallocated sectors i see
[04:16] <LjL> hm and offline_uncorrectable as well doesn't sound good imho
[04:16] <Paradox34690> Hey all... I'm using Ubuntu 6.10 (edgy eft) and I have a question about the keyring manager. anyone care to help me out with this?
[04:16] <soundray> LjL: does that indicate that the drive has tried to compensate for bad blocks?
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: just ask, please
[04:16] <Paradox34690> k, sorry...
[04:16] <LjL> soundray: yes... and IIRC, offline_uncorrectable means it hasn't managed to restore some of the sectors using the CRC
[04:17] <LjL> current_pending_sector is also related
[04:17] <LjL> all in all, soundray, i'd say your drive is in trouble ;)
[04:17] <trappist> yeah I'd start doing some serious backups and shopping
[04:18] <Paradox34690> well, i'm a windows baby first off... totally new to linux, but have been wanting to check it out for the longest time... Anyways, I have a couple of windows shares that whenever I'm connecting to them I'm constantly being asked to provide a password even though I'm checking the little "Store in keyring" box...   Obviously, it's not getting stored... How can I correct this?
[04:18] <LjL> what bothers me the most is that i have UDMA_CRC_Error_Count always fluctuating and reaching zero
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: o.k. did you set your keyring password to the same as your login password?
[04:18] <LjL> i'm unsure that's very meaningful though, since my drive is reported as unrecognized by smartmontools, so it could be giving attributes the wrong labels
[04:18] <trappist> Paradox34690: what I would do is permanently mount the shares via /etc/fstab
[04:19] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: there's two ways to fix this, 'sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring-manager'  use that to auth all the apps to always have access to the keyring
[04:19] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: the other way is to enable the pam_keyring module for gdm desktop sessions, so that once you log in, your password is carried into the keyring daemon
[04:19] <LjL> soundray: your drive's attribute list looks very similar if not identical to mine, by the way... is it a maxtor? and which one? "smartctl -i"
[04:19] <Paradox34690> um... if you mean the password for the share that I'm connecting to? No.  Trappist, that won't work because I'm not connected to those shares persistantly...
[04:19] <soundray> LjL: mine is a Maxtor with something like a 20-year guarantee, so I'll go complain ;)
[04:19] <trappist> Paradox34690: ah.
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: here's the pam module howto, with Edgy you don't have to compile it, just install the pam-keyring package, it works.  The /etc/pam.d/gdm config change has to be done though
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=187874
[04:20] <Khamael> is the nvidia 1.0-9xxx driver on its into ubuntu?
[04:20] <soundray> LjL: Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 family, Device Model:     Maxtor 6Y120L0
[04:21] <LjL> soundray: plus 9 as well here, but Maxtor 6L160P0
[04:22] <Paradox34690> Kingsqueak, with this 'sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring-manager' method, does this mean that when I connect to a share (or whatever... anything that's asking me to store my password to the keyring) that it will create an entry in my keyring (the one I create through keyring manager) and store the password for whatever I'm working on in it?
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: that app 'gnome-keyring-manager' authorizes applications to have access to the keyring
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: the pam module does the initial 'unlocking' of the keyring
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: the combination of the two makes it all happen in the background after you've logged in once to your desktop session
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: it will only work if your user login is the same password as the keyring manager though
[04:24] <soundray> LjL, trappist: thanks for your input. Rebooting to rescued system now :)
[04:24] <Paradox34690> Oh, yeah, I set up my keyring to have the same u/n and p/w, so I don't forsee that being an issue... now it's just a matter of getting everything to work together :)
[04:24] <LjL> soundray: good luck :)
[04:24] <soundray> LjL: cheers
[04:24] <Paradox34690> Kingsqueak: thanks for the forum link though, i'm checking that out now.
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: basically pam, if you don't know, ties authentication into various things, in this case pam_keyring ties auth for your session into the keyring
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> Paradox34690: there are others like pam_ldap which would check you against an LDAP database etc.
[04:25] <b3nton> anybody knows cedega xlibs problem?
[04:26] <sqrxz> Hi, is it in the ~/.xsession  file you put "xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults" so it is run on X startup?
[04:27] <Paradox34690> Kingsqueak, let me put it this way... my knowledge of linux is about nil... I JUST installed it about a week ago and have been baby-stepping it the whole time...

[04:50] <Dragonfyre> nolimitsoya: kind of. I had to do it once on a production server here at work, but basically, you switch kernels using some screwy commands that someone more knowledgable than myself came up with.

[04:55] <kingrayray> how would i make a .deb of a pre-compiled package? i.e. the last.fm client beta
[04:56] <VigoFuse> Yes, he would like Install Disks, I suggested ShipIt, prolly need 5, I dont think that is above the Corporate or reaches Corporate. just asking while I am here.
[04:56] <Dragonfyre> nolimitsoya: VigoFuse: actually, the best way to go about it is to contact one of the support groups listed on the ubuntu site. They will help with the conversion.
[04:56] <mtlife> why does booting with an ldap server take AGES?
[04:56] <jimmypw> ok my next question is how do i kill zombie processes?
[04:56] <jimmypw> (using init)
[04:56] <VigoFuse> Yes, goood suggestion, Thank you./
[04:56] <Dragonfyre> VigoFuse: then go through shipit. Or, check out one of the linux CD shipping places. It's a couple bucks, but it gets there much quicker.
[04:57] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: Ok, execute an init 3, and if that doesn't kill it, bring it down to init 2
[04:57] <jimmypw> ok ill give it a go
[04:57] <Dragonfyre> init 2 will kill your net connection I think though.
[04:57] <Dragonfyre> That's why you should do init 3 first.
[04:57] <VigoFuse> And is the insurance of a clean system ISO, stuff can get jumbled in Internet transfers.
[04:58] <nolimitsoya> VigoFuse, thats what md5 hashes are for :)

[04:58] <Dragonfyre> VigoFuse: yes, but you should also check out one of the support companies for Ubuntu. There are plenty out there, and it helps to mitigate risk in a business situation.
[04:58] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: you already on the terminal?
[04:59] <nolimitsoya> Dragonfyre, wouldnt gpl mean restrictions on using ubuntu with propietary code, as in the restricted packages?

[04:59] <LjL> Duck_: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/desktop-tips.html
[04:59] <mtlife> why does booting with an ldap server take AGES? is that normal?
[04:59] <VigoFuse> True, with these laws and WIPO junk, its getting crazy out/in here/there
[04:59] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: ah. Ok, well try a telinit 2. Where is the physical machine?
[04:59] <grimboy> I have a bunch of *.pcf.gz fonts. I don't know their dpi, where should I put them? Should I just shove them straight into /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/?
[05:00] <nolimitsoya> Dragonfyre, meaning? :) i get the feeling i need to reread the licenses and do some technical homework...
[05:00] <jimmypw> Dragonfyre: next to me
[05:00] <kippi> I am looking for an automatic black list program, has anyone got anyideas? Blacklist so if someone has ssh/ftp etc and put in the wrong user/pass 3 times it blocks them
[05:00] <Dragonfyre> VigoFuse: also they can help with app migration too.
[05:00] <jbroome> kippi: look at denyhosts
[05:00] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: just making sure.
[05:00] <jbroome> dunno if that does FTP, but definitly ssh
[05:00] <jimmypw> Dragonfyre: dont worry mate, thanks for your help, ill just reboot
[05:00] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: do a telinit 2 then first.
[05:01] <VigoFuse> I thank you kindly for the input, it is reliable and true to form.
[05:01] <Dragonfyre> jimmypw: sorry, telinit 1
[05:01] <Dragonfyre> dang. Nevermind.
[05:01] <Dragonfyre> Dropping the runlevel should have borked the process and kicked it right?
[05:01] <jared> Where is the file for mythTV to tell it the location of the SQL database? I told it the wrong location on setup
[05:01] <Dragonfyre> VigoFuse: I used to be one of the migration guys.
[05:02] <Dragonfyre> jared: run the setup program again. I wouldn't go in and mess with the configs if you have to ask on mythtv.
[05:02] <Dragonfyre> jared: it's spread out in more than a few places.
[05:03] <jared> I tried to run setup again it keeps giving me an error Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.1.100' (113)
[05:04] <VigoFuse> I have been Technicall Advisor for a few places, and most all them are now Linux. now.Of course we use Windows cause people are used to it, but migration and fast switching is becomeing easier as each day passes.
[05:04] <schierbeck> hi
[05:04] <schierbeck> im having a problem with edgy
[05:05] <grimboy> VigoFuse, So you are becoming slowly redundant. Mwahahaha! (sorry)
[05:05] <Poromenos1> i have installed a new hd in my pc that has an ntfs partition on it, is there a graphical way i can format it to ext3?
[05:05] <carlosqueso> schierbeck, shoot
[05:05] <LjL> Poromenos1: gparted
[05:05] <VigoFuse> 2shay! good one
[05:05] <Poromenos1> LjL: great, thanks a lot
[05:05] <schierbeck> carlosqueso: thanks. i installed the release candidate some time ago
[05:05] <scythe128> doesn't gnome have its own partition manager?
[05:06] <schierbeck> carlosqueso: and now i only get unstable versions when updating
[05:06] <Poromenos1> LjL: do i have to mess with the fstab or anything after that?
[05:06] <LjL> Poromenos1: if you want to mount it, yes ;)
[05:06] <Poromenos1> LjL: ah :P
[05:06] <schierbeck> can i set synaptic to only get the "normal" updates?
[05:06] <LjL> !mount | or perhaps you can do it graphically
[05:06] <ubotu> or perhaps you can do it graphically: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[05:06] <Poromenos1> LjL: great, thanks
[05:06] <carlosqueso> I'm not sure, as I use dapper, but what do you mean by "unstable" updates?
[05:07] <Poromenos1> although there are no "disks" in administration
[05:07] <schierbeck> carlosqueso: pretty much every single app i have crashes daily
[05:07] <LjL> Poromenos1: well i can only trust the bot, since i'm not a Gnome user
[05:07] <Poromenos1> LjL: hmm, well, i'm looking at it, though, and there are none :p
[05:07] <LjL> schierbeck: that's ugly, but it doesn't mean you're not getting the right packages
[05:07] <schierbeck> carlosqueso: i figured it was because my system was configured to get the latest
[05:07] <VigoFuse> gparted is included, its nifty, I like the stand alone version, less trouble on some systems. or maybe I am just too DOS in bedded. :-)
[05:07] <Paradox34690> Hey kingsqueak, i setup that PAM you were telling me about... but um... i forgot to do a copy/paste on the rest of the stuff you said and wound up rebooting it (according to the instructions on the forum page you sent me)... Mind helping me out one last time? :D
[05:07] <boggle> does anyone know how to enable Umlaute in PDF exports in Open Office (2.0.4 on Edgy)
[05:08] <LjL> schierbeck: pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list - but i don't think
[05:08] <carlosqueso> well...that is yucky, but if your sources.list is pointed at edgy, then it should stop
[05:08] <nolimitsoya> is there any way to give kde a xfcelike desktop rightclick menu?
[05:08] <Poromenos1> parted does not display my new disk, is there something i can do?
[05:08] <bart_> shockwawe in wine
[05:09] <scythe128> poro, does your bios see your disk?
[05:09] <The_Jack_of_Club> http://www.thejackofclubs.dyndns.org/images/ubuntu10.png
[05:09] <Poromenos1> god, i should really connect the power cable to it :(
[05:09] <schierbeck> carlosqueso: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33125/
[05:09] <The_Jack_of_Club> check that out
[05:09] <Poromenos1> scythe128: i thought it did, but now i realise that was probably the CD rom
[05:09] <mariano> has anyone seen crashes in gnome-terminal related to FreeType, as in <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373402#stacktrace>?
[05:09] <scythe128> power cables help :)
[05:09] <Poromenos1> scythe128: immensely :)
[05:09] <grimboy> How do I refresh the font cache?
[05:10] <The_Jack_of_Club> i have a removable cd rom drive for my laptop and it plays havoc with ubuntu
[05:10] <tx> hi all, i get a lot of "nscd: 6065 no more memory for database 'passwd'" in my logs , what is it about ?
[05:10] <LjL> schierbeck, remove edgy-proposed from the repository list
[05:10] <tx> i guess i have the nscd daemon running , but what's this about no more memory for database passwd
[05:10] <schierbeck> LjL: thanks!
[05:10] <jrib> grimboy: fc-cache
[05:10] <scythe128> jack 0 clubs... does it have a non standard interface?
[05:10] <grimboy> jrib, Thanks.
[05:10] <Poromenos1> LjL: is that the "propsed updates" option in update manager?
[05:10] <LjL> schierbeck: (also, edgy-backports might give you unstable packages... but not right now, since it's empty and will be for a while)
[05:10] <The_Jack_of_Club> i dunno
[05:11] <Dragonfyre> nolimitsoya: try kde-look.org
[05:11] <The_Jack_of_Club> its a crappy dell
[05:11] <The_Jack_of_Club> so i figure yes
[05:11] <LjL> Poromenos1: i'd guess so, but then again i don't use Gnome
[05:11] <nolimitsoya> Dragonfyre, thank you :)
[05:11] <schierbeck> LjL: ok. can i roll back my packages to not include packages from those two repos?
[05:11] <LjL> schierbeck: however now you'll have those proposed updates already installed
[05:11] <Poromenos1> LjL: oh, right. so what are they, new packages that aren't as stable?
[05:11] <LjL> schierbeck, no, at least not easily
[05:11] <The_Jack_of_Club> it worked one time and that was having it connected when i started up after installing
[05:11] <scythe128> probably tjoc... that is an interesting message though.  Never seen a system boot and have a hal issue :)
[05:11] <schierbeck> balls
[05:11] <Dragonfyre> nolimitsoya: it has a lot of good stuff on there.
[05:12] <schierbeck> LjL: well, eventually it'll sort itself out i guess.
[05:12] <The_Jack_of_Club> after that no matter what i do i cant read or connect to the cd rom
[05:12] <LjL> schierbeck: you can remove them and reinstall them, but i have a feeling most of them are quite core packages like x11-common and such, so you'd be left with a half-broken system if you remove them
[05:12] <schierbeck> LjL: ok, ill investigate a bit. thanks for your help
[05:12] <The_Jack_of_Club> windows reads it as a removable device and puts it in the "safe hardware removal" thing in the taskbar
[05:12] <schierbeck> you too, carlosqueso
[05:12] <LjL> Poromenos1: yes, they're packages that are *proposed* for addition to -updates, but haven't landed there yet
[05:12] <The_Jack_of_Club> ubuntu hates the damn thing
[05:13] <Dragonfyre> schierbeck: just take them out of the sources.list and then make sure to update a lot so it replaces them with the stable versions when they come out.
[05:13] <Poromenos1> LjL: i see
[05:13] <LjL> schierbeck: but you're right, if you wait they should end up in -updates or -security eventually
[05:13] <Poromenos1> by the way, is opera in the repositories? i never could find it anywhere, and i've installed 2 different ubuntu versions on 4 different computers. none of them had it
[05:13] <schierbeck> will do
[05:13] <LjL> protocol1: it's in dapper-commercial
[05:13] <Dragonfyre> LjL: schierbeck: exactly.
[05:13] <scythe128> poromenos... i  think it is
[05:13] <LjL> !opera | Poromenos1
[05:13] <ubotu> Poromenos1: opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[05:14] <Quinn_Storm> eww, opera
[05:14] <Poromenos1> Quinn_Storm: opera rocks :(
[05:14] <VigoFuse> http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS5694152032.html <<<Is that release a real Ubuntu? upgrade? or am I confused.
[05:14] <LjL> no browser wars please ;)
[05:14] <Quinn_Storm> opera=non-free
=== AfterDeath_ is now known as AfterDeath
[05:14] <Dragonfyre> Poromenos1: Yeah, it kinda does. ^_^
[05:14] <Poromenos1> firefox=non-awesome
[05:14] <Poromenos1> :P
[05:14] <scythe128> hey.. its supposed to pass acid2.. konquerer is the only other one for linux that I know of.... am I wrong?
[05:14] <webben> If you're using Edgy, best to use the packages from sid
[05:14] <Poromenos1> LjL: it's not a browser war, more of a browser peaceful debate
[05:14] <LjL> VigoFuse, it's another distribution. it uses some parts of ubuntu, a bit like ubuntu uses parts of debian
[05:14] <Dragonfyre> Quinn_Storm: yea, but it depends on the philosiphy behind your draw to FOSS.
[05:15] <LjL> Poromenos1: which invariably end up in wars :)
[05:15] <webben> put deb http://deb.opera.com/opera sid non-free in /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:15] <Poromenos1> LjL: if you're 12 :p
[05:15] <webben> you'll need to install the GPG key too
[05:15] <VigoFuse> Thank you
[05:15] <webben> VigoFuse, more help here: http://deb.opera.com/
[05:15] <Dragonfyre> webben: actually, you can load on the dapper deb.
[05:15] <Poromenos1> what are backported updates?
[05:16] <Dragonfyre> webben: it works quite well.
[05:16] <scythe128> what browsers pass acid2? (not trying to start a war... just looking at my options)
[05:16] <webben> Dragonfyre, I'm not saying it won't work. It's just not what I recommend.
[05:16] <Poromenos1> scythe128: umm, firefox, opera, safari i think
[05:16] <LjL> Poromenos1: they're new versions of packages from the next (experimental) ubuntu version. they're made on request of users (though requests can be denied, mostly only packages that are easy and troublesome to port are ported)
[05:16] <Dragonfyre> Poromenos1: basically they are debs that are in edgy for example, that they roll back to also be included in dapper.
[05:16] <LjL> !backports
[05:16] <ubotu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[05:16] <thor> shockwawe in wine/firefox 1.07
[05:16] <webben> Dragonfyre, AFAIK Canonical doesn't do the packaging for the commercial repo. So it's probably better to use the latest Opera packages.
[05:16] <Poromenos1> LjL: so i should better not use them?
[05:17] <Dragonfyre> webben: just offering alternatives.
[05:17] <LjL> Poromenos1: *shrug* depends on you. they're not guaranteed to work or be stable
[05:17] <Poromenos1> scythe128: maybe check wikipedia, it might have a good comparison table
[05:17] <Poromenos1> LjL: ah, okay, thanks :)
[05:17] <scythe128> firefox fails... thanx
[05:17] <LjL> Poromenos1: "The new official backports currently do not receive testing (unlike the old unofficial backports). The stability of the packages should be the same as that of the Ubuntu unstable distribution (currently Feisty Fawn)."
[05:17] <Dragonfyre> webben: yeah, but I've run into major issues with debian debs before on edgy.
[05:17] <Poromenos1> scythe128: hmm, i thought it passed
[05:17] <webben> Dragonfyre, deb's generally sure
[05:17] <scythe128> well firefox 2 does... just tried it (literally
[05:17] <Poromenos1> LjL: aha, i see... i'll wait then
[05:18] <Quinn_Storm> I'm drawn to FLOSS not FOSS
[05:18] <Poromenos1> scythe128: ah
[05:18] <webben> Dragonfyre, but the Opera deb is okay AFAIK.
[05:18] <LjL> Poromenos1: right now edgy's backports is empty anyway
[05:18] <Poromenos1> LjL: ah, good, so nothing was installe
[05:18] <Poromenos1> d
[05:18] <Dragonfyre> webben: quite likely.
[05:18] <thor> no help
[05:18] <LjL> Poromenos1: no, since feisty is in such an early stage
[05:18] <webben> Poromenos1, alternatively pull down the source and use checkinstall
[05:18] <Dragonfyre> webben: generally the opera corp is pretty good about that.
[05:19] <webben> VigoFuse, Note that there are still serious problems with Flash Player 9 plugin and Opera however.
[05:19] <Dragonfyre> webben: you aren't talking about pulling the source for opera are you?
[05:19] <webben> Dragonfyre, no
[05:19] <Dragonfyre> webben: not so much anymore. They've fixed a lot of the major ones.
[05:19] <thor> bye bye
[05:19] <webben> Dragonfyre, I'm talking about the backports stuff.
[05:19] <Dragonfyre> webben: ah. Good, got a bit freaked there.
[05:19] <Dragonfyre> bye thor
[05:20] <webben> Dragonfyre, According to one of the two Linux Flash devs... still very broken in Opera.
[05:20] <webben> (this is with beta 2 released yesterday)
[05:20] <VigoFuse> webben: Yes, that newsletter just arrived today, so I looked at it, then I ask others, I will install it and if machine crashes, that is what backups are for.
[05:20] <Dragonfyre> webben: ah, well then I'm thinking of something else. Perhaps something with opera, flash and wine.
[05:20] <Sped> t
[05:20] <Dragonfyre> sped: hey.
[05:21] <webben> Dragonfyre, details here: http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/11/flash-player-9-for-linux-beta-2.html
[05:21] <Dragonfyre> webben: I'll check it out.
[05:23] <Acke_ubu> hey where in dev would my usbdrives be found_
[05:23] <Acke_ubu> ?
[05:23] <Acke_ubu> !usb
[05:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:23] <carlosqueso> probably /dev/sda#
[05:23] <Dragonfyre> webben: Ah, well that blows what I said out of the water. Definately thinking of something else then. Perhaps wine dev like I said.
[05:23] <minerale> I have upgraded to the latest version via dist upgrade, but when I try to update I keep getting a list of packages that are greyed out, when I try to manually do aptitude upgrade I get a list of packages that have been "kept back": ibggi2 mplayer   -- what does this mean?
[05:24] <Acke_ubu> carlosqueso, i already have a sda drive. thats the only drive shown. sda.
[05:24] <carlosqueso> actually, now that i think about it /dev/sdx
[05:24] <Acke_ubu> no i was wrong
[05:24] <Acke_ubu> sry
[05:24] <pyro> hi guys
[05:24] <carlosqueso> where x is the letter of your usb drive
[05:24] <munki> anybody know how to change the charset in Beep-Media-Player ? (if it is possible)
[05:24] <Dragonfyre> minerale: it'll do that sometimes. It's because all the dependancies aren
[05:24] <Dragonfyre> t there.
[05:24] <pyro> just installed ubuntu, works a treat :)
[05:24] <Dragonfyre> pyro: glad to have another convert!
[05:25] <Dragonfyre> pyro: welcome abord!
[05:25] <pyro> Dragonfyre: thanks, it was the only dist that had my wifi working out of the box :)
[05:25] <pyro> i have previously been a fedora / redhat user
[05:25] <kmaynard> eww
[05:25] <Dragonfyre> pyro: yeah, we're better. ^_^
[05:25] <pyro> so its taking a little bit to get used to apt
[05:26] <Dragonfyre> pyro: besides, you'll fall in love with apt-get.
[05:26] <jaras> what does "ubuntu-desktop metapackage" mean?
[05:26] <Dragonfyre> pyro: well, it's a different world.
[05:26] <carlosqueso> pyro: it'll be wierd at first, but definitely worth it
[05:26] <pyro> Dragonfyre: yeah it seems great so far! no problems with getting packages
[05:26] <minerale> one more question, after the upgrade I'm no longer able to switch between windows normally, If I have two windows and one is overlapping the other, clicking the window behind does not bring it forward, hard to descibe but unless I minimise each window I can't seem to bring any forward
[05:26] <jrib> jaras: it is a package that just depends on a bunch of other packages
[05:26] <carlosqueso> jaras: it's a list of all the stuff you need for ubuntu-desktop, but there's no actual stuff
[05:26] <Dragonfyre> pyro: just imagine, NO MORE DEPENDANCY HELL!!!!!
[05:26] <minerale> 6
[05:26] <SiCuTDeUx> jaras: that's the main package of the distro
[05:26] <pyro> Dragonfyre: yeah for sure! so far im impressed :)
[05:27] <carlosqueso> if you're using apg-get and it says it'll remove it, it's okay
[05:27] <jaras> carlosqueso: i'm following a guide wich says i have to install it...
[05:27] <SiCuTDeUx> jaras: contains the desktop and other software
[05:27] <pyro> question, how do i apt-remove so to speak?
[05:27] <Dragonfyre> jaras: then do so.
[05:27] <jrib> jaras: you'll need ubuntu-desktop when upgrading to a new release
[05:27] <kmaynard> pyro, apt-get remove foo
[05:27] <carlosqueso> jaras: well, are you going to want to use a desktop, office and stuff?
[05:27] <kmaynard> pyro, actually, sudo foo
[05:27] <kmaynard> crap
[05:27] <pyro> kmaynard: thanks :)
[05:28] <kmaynard> pyro, actually, sudo apt-get remove foo
[05:28] <SiCuTDeUx> jaras: that's what you need to install.
[05:28] <Dragonfyre> pyro: do this - sudo apt-get moo
[05:28] <pyro> kmaynard: yep gotcha
[05:28] <jaras> it say's "Install your *ubuntu-desktop metapackage specific to your DE, e.g. sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
[05:28] <Dragonfyre> pyro: it's hilarious.
[05:28] <pyro> lol
[05:28] <pyro> "mooo"
[05:28] <Dragonfyre> mooooooooo!!!
[05:28] <Dragonfyre> hehhehehe
[05:29] <Dragonfyre> pyro: I'm a bit wierd.
[05:29] <pyro> im running kiba and beryl too
[05:29] <pyro> ive been playing with bouncy icons and cool window effects
[05:29] <Dragonfyre> pyro: I'm running beryl, what's kiba?
[05:29] <pyro> kiba-dock
[05:29] <jrib> jaras: what is the tutorial for?
[05:29] <Dragonfyre> pyro: where do you get that?
[05:29] <Dragonfyre> pyro: and what is it?
[05:29] <pyro> Dragonfyre: ill get you a URL
[05:29] <jaras> jrib: beryl from the ubuntuguide
[05:29] <Dragonfyre> pyro: thanx
[05:30] <Dragonfyre> jaras: ah. Are you in edgy?
[05:30] <webben> Other than potentially hosing one's system as you try and get it working, does beryl hog resources?
[05:30] <jaras> Dragonfyre: yes
[05:30] <mp3guy> how do I enable s-video out on my nvidia card?

[05:35] <Dragonfyre> pyro: ok, that think kicks butt.
[05:36] <jmdc> carlosqueso: thanks, but even the verbose mode doesn't show me chipset info. I get bus numbers and Id numbers, etc etc.

[05:42] <webben> VigoFuse, Which "thing" is thing?
[05:43] <lamvda> how can i find my garbage bin?
[05:44] <nolimitsoya> lamvda, look under your desk. or kitchen sink :)
[05:44] <jmdc> carlosqueso, yeah I've seen that too, and I agree with you. Normally, lsusb would give me a chipset, similarly to lspci right?
[05:44] <carlosqueso> yeah
[05:44] <lamvda> it is not on my desktop
[05:44] <lamvda> :\

[05:44] <carlosqueso> jmdc: i'd post in the forums, maybe somebody has your card?
[05:45] <carlosqueso> or go on the linksys website
[05:46] <jmdc> the vendors never seem to publish that information
[05:46] <jmdc> but I'll check
[05:46] <carlosqueso> yeah, I know

[05:47] <Creeture> Hey kids. Anybody know how to make KDE maximize across both displays of a Xinerama display?
[05:47] <kmaynard> LjL, do you have a macro for that? that's a lot of typing every time

[05:51] <scythe128> jmdc intel pro 2200bg is a very well supported wireless card
[05:51] <geokok> I try in a script this Y=$[X+1]  where x=1 but i cant get y=2. Any ideas?
[05:52] <scythe128> jmdc most intel wireless cards are very well supported actually
[05:54] <MiKEn00b> Hi
[05:54] <incorrect> are there any better alternatives to a central home dir other than NFS
[05:54] <incorrect> a home dir system for laptops that can do off line fs would be nice
[05:54] <FunnyLookinHat> incorrect, you could use samba as well if you wanted...  but I'd stick with NFS
[05:54] <pluma> I installed the Enlightenment window manager via the repository. I can't find the Entrance login manager in the repos -- but its makefile requires the presence of some components which Entrance require but don't seem to be recognised unless you installed them from CVS... is there a package somewhere so I don't have to remove Enlightenment again and compile everything myself?
[05:55] <incorrect> FunnyLookinHat: I am already using NFS to give homes to windows users
[05:55] <FunnyLookinHat> incorrect, then I
[05:55] <mark92> hello
[05:55] <FunnyLookinHat> then I'd stick with it, I don't think there is really a better way
[05:55] <FunnyLookinHat> unless you were having issues with NFS and windows then I'd suggest SMB
[05:55] <FunnyLookinHat> mark92, greetings
[05:55] <jmdc> scythe128, thanks. I'm in the position of needing a usb wireless card. (The laptop doesn't have a free pc card slot) I wish I could just use intel's wireless, but I have to have usb.

[05:58] <Crescendo> Does Flash9 player for Linux and this news about Java mean that it'll come with Ubuntu any time soon?
[05:58] <LjL> Crescendo: we have java already for that matter, it's in multiverse
[05:58] <jmdc> sycthe128, no. Please enlighten me.
[05:58] <FunnyLookinHat> Crescendo, if it comes out of beta it will most likely be bundled with Feisty Fawn, the 7.04 release
[05:58] <LjL> Crescendo: and we have unofficial flash9 packages
[05:58] <FunnyLookinHat> Crescendo, ooh, you meant flash9 right?  not java?
[05:58] <nolimitsoya> how do i permanently set swappiness to 0?
[05:59] <LjL> nolimitsoya: perhaps add a command to that effect to /etc/rc.local
[05:59] <scythe128> jmdc  an eithernet bridge takes input from your wired nic and will turn it into a wireless connection.  You usually configure it over the network
[05:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell nolimitsoya about boot | nolimitsoya, you have a private message from Ubotu

[05:59] <zidoo> why ubuntu does't have port for comodore 64?
[05:59] <FunnyLookinHat> zidoo, that's a fairly unused arch  : )
[05:59] <LjL> zidoo: the standard Linux kernel requires hardware memory protection
[05:59] <FunnyLookinHat> zidoo, I'd suggest DSL for that
[05:59] <scythe128> jmdc.. they are usually expensive... but since there is no drivers to load... it is a guarenteed working solution
[05:59] <zidoo> but we can do some emulation for memoy
[06:00] <scythe128> zidoo lol!!!
[06:00] <zidoo> :)
[06:00] <FunnyLookinHat> MiKEn00b, Did that site help you out?  I can walk you through individual packages if you would like...
[06:00] <LjL> zidoo: you'd have to run the entire OS under emulation.
[06:00] <zidoo> be cool
[06:00] <zidoo> bye
[06:00] <zidoo> just testing xchat
[06:00] <Crescendo> Yeah, I installed flash9 beta when it was released, just wondering about Flash and Java being bundled, preinstalled, etc etc for future releases, so I can tell clients, "Everything works out of the box."

[06:01] <FunnyLookinHat> MiKEn00b, sounds good.  I might be AFK so just ask the general channel
[06:01] <FunnyLookinHat> Crescendo, yup.
[06:01] <defrysk> Crescendo, its in the making, even including beryl if i am correct
[06:01] <Crescendo> Awesome, and awesome again.

[06:03] <ademan> anyone here have trouble playing wolfenstein: enemy territory?
[06:04] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, i can play it on my laptop just fine..
[06:04] <defrysk> ademan, I do , mostly with the other players ;p
[06:04] <scythe128> jmdc  check out  http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdevcat.php?id=16  it might help answer your question
[06:04] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, what's your issue?
[06:04] <ademan> when i try to start it up it crashes x and dumps me back at the login screen
[06:04] <sc4ttrbrain> Crescendo:  aiglx or xgl? which one for my ati mobility radeon 9000 igp
[06:05] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, what graphics card do you have?
[06:05] <ademan> geforce go 6600
[06:05] <Crescendo> sc4ttrbrain, FAIK, both will work.
[06:05] <ademan> i play ut2k4 just fine, and even cs source with wine fine
[06:05] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, have you installed the nvidia proprietary driver?
[06:05] <ademan> of course
[06:05] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, hmm...
=== ubuntu4alexej is now known as AV1611
[06:05] <Crescendo> They both have fundamental differences, sc4ttrbrain - XGL is an extension, while AIGLX is embedded within X.
[06:05] <Crescendo> Try #ubuntu-xgl
[06:06] <sc4ttrbrain> Crescendo: then which one is the best? sorry for silly question
[06:06] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, you could try checking the error logs, iirc you can send a special argument to the et program when running it to make a specific video mode work
[06:06] <ademan> yeah
[06:06] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: aiglx performs better, but its not that well supported (especially by ATI). XGL is supported well, but has some performance issues.
[06:06] <ademan> apparently my "error" occurs when it tries to use a higher resolution than the desktop
[06:07] <ademan> but there's no higher resolution than my desktop noted in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:07] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, that makes sense...   try a dpkg-reconfigure and make sure that you have all possible resolutions allowed for X
[06:07] <scythe128> jmdc  the belkin F5D7051 is supported in linux according to http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdevcat.php?id=16&o=40&w=t&s=v&d=a
[06:07] <LjL> nolimitsoya: /etc/rc.local doesn't exist? weird, it should. if not just try creating it
[06:07] <LjL> nolimitsoya: you on edgy?
[06:07] <Crescendo> sc4ttrbrain, I'd say AIGLX is better - if I note correctly, it is included in Edgy.
[06:07] <nolimitsoya> LjL, yes
[06:07] <Crescendo> I may be mistaken.
[06:07] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, I had a lot of issues forcing it to use 640x480 for my laptop and making it fullscreen still...  they're mostly issues with the ET programming unfortunately, so I had a hard time getting around them
[06:08] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: bottom line, both are very much still beta software -- so either one will have issues if you don't have 100% supported hardware. From what I remember, intel chipsets work great with aiglx; nvidia's beta drivers work with aiglx, and for ati -- either get nvidia, or use xgl.
[06:08] <jmdc> scythe128, great link.
[06:08] <sc4ttrbrain> fyrestrtr: what do youmean not well supported? by what ? graphic cards?
[06:08] <ademan> i've got all the important ones,    "1920x1200" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"         (the first is my lcd's native resolution, the rest are ... well... standard)
[06:08] <jmdc> scythe128, thanks very much. I'm well on my way
[06:08] <nolimitsoya> LjL, ok, sudo nano /etc/rc.local | what now? :)
[06:08] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: yes, by drivers. You need certain extensions in the drivers for the wobbly stuff to work, and not all drivers are compatible.
[06:08] <scythe128> jmdc np.. I just didnt know if you saw the link the the flood of other messages :)
[06:09] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, yea....  i'm not seeing a specific error log...  which is lame.
[06:09] <yango> where do you configure the size of desktop Gnome icons?
[06:09] <ademan> i tried et > SomeErrorLog.dump  and all that was in it was "recieved signal 1 exiting..."
[06:09] <sc4ttrbrain> fyrestrtr: where to check whether my radeon 9000 supported ornot?
[06:09] <ademan> yango: right click on one and hit "stretch icon"
[06:10] <jmdc> scythe128, this is great. Thanks again.
[06:10] <yango> ademan, but the default size
[06:10] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, ahh, you may have to edit your profile for et in console or with a text editor... i found mine at ~/.etwolf/etmain/profiles/profile_name       try setting the rez to something easy like 1024x768
[06:10] <yango> ademan, I don't want to modify each
[06:10] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: example, on my ati-based laptop, I have to use the open source drivers because they support aiglx -- but then I can't use the powersaving features of the laptop (for that, I need the drivers from ati.com) and those don't support aiglx but support xgl. I just keep my desktop "normal" :)
[06:10] <raghu206> how can i install kiba-dock in edgy
[06:10] <sc4ttrbrain> fyrestrtr: i just installed edgy in laptop, and everything (graphic cards etc) seems work by default
[06:11] <ademan> FunnyLookinHat: i think i might have it figured out the problem (i had AddARGBGLXVisuals in the screen section of my xorg.conf, MAYBE its causing a problem. i'll brb)
[06:11] <ademan> raghu206: get the tarball ./configure && make install
[06:11] <FunnyLookinHat> ademan, sounds good
[06:11] <gpled> looking for docs on ubuntu webserver for 6.06
[06:11] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: yes, but do you have 3D acceleration? :)
[06:12] <FunnyLookinHat> gpled, what's your specific issue?  You should probably ask in #ubuntu-server
[06:12] <sc4ttrbrain> fyrestrtr: how to check that?
[06:12] <raghu206> ademan, can u give me the link
[06:12] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl for Xgl-supported card, and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/AIGLX for AIGLX.
[06:12] <sc4ttrbrain> thanks
[06:12] <gpled> FunnyLookinHat: just looking for docs
[06:12] <fyrestrtr> sc4ttrbrain: the wiki pages will get you started.
[06:13] <FunnyLookinHat> gpled, best place to look would be:   wiki.ubuntu.com or www.ubuntuforums.org
[06:13] <nothlit> Captive (ntfs) leads to a 100% compatible driver but the wrapper itself is known to have some bug, and is really really slow... can anyone tell me what the bugs are?
[06:13] <shadowsong> hi
[06:13] <fyrestrtr> gpled: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ :)
[06:14] <gpled> think i found some: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/httpd.html
[06:14] <gtwy> when using samba to connect to a windows share i was prompted for a login/password... used my local password on that computer but it wouldnt authorize. any ideas?
[06:14] <FunnyLookinHat> gpled, awesome, let me know if you have any questions
[06:14] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, you may have to use the admin user/pass for the windows computer
[06:14] <globe> gtwy: you should use your windows password, not your linux pwd
[06:14] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, it can be very buggy at times, because samba looks for a password sometimes where there is none
[06:14] <nothlit> You might also have to use the machine name
[06:14] <fyrestrtr> gtwy: if your windows machine allows guest browsing, just hit enter.
[06:15] <gtwy> FunnyLookinHat: i was using my windows login/password. no, the directory needs a password
[06:15] <gtwy> FunnyLookinHat: the windows share is actually on vista which is what i think is causing the problem
[06:15] <fyrestrtr> nothlit: http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/ might help
[06:15] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, strange...
[06:15] <nothlit> but you can also mount as guest smbmount/smbclient -o guest (for read/write you'll also need ,uid=useridnumberhere)
[06:15] <gtwy> however, i am able to login from a win2k box so i dunno
[06:16] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, yea that could be it.  I know that for me to get it all working I had to make sure that my windows install had absoultely no passwords on it or else it would keep asking for one even if I gave it the right one
[06:16] <globe> gtwy: you might have to do something like this in the un field: MACHINENAME/username
[06:16] <fyrestrtr> gtwy: can you see the share in Network Servers?
[06:16] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, you can also adjust the share's properties in your windows box, i believe you can set a password field there or not
[06:16] <gtwy> FunnyLookinHat: i still have to play with it. MS went and moved all the configurations around to make it stupid proof and it sort of FORCES you to have a password on your shares
[06:17] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, oh lame....
[06:17] <ochosi> hi, i'm using mail-notification 2.0 in edgy and i can't use the "mail-reader" feature because it tries to open evolution (although i don't have it installed). any ideas how to change that to thunderbird? (btw in my preferred apps there's of course thunderbird for email)
[06:17] <fyrestrtr> gtwy: welcome to vista :)
[06:17] <FunnyLookinHat> gtwy, I've got to run for now...   hope you get that working  : )
[06:17] <gtwy> FunnyLookinHat: thanks
[06:17] <fyrestrtr> ochosi: did you manually remove evolution?
[06:17] <Man1> hello, i have a problem
=== Man1 is now known as Macyh
[06:18] <globe> Macyh: speak your problem, or forever hold your peace ....
[06:18] <Yoric> Does anyone know how to configure Gnome so that my laptop goes to sleep whenever I close the lid ?
[06:18] <Macyh> the add/remove options just dissapeared from the applications menu
[06:18] <LuisMendes> can someone help me with beryl? when I start it, I get "beryl: No composite extension"
[06:18] <ochosi> fyrestrtr, nope, i know that this is for ubuntu and not xubuntu, but in the xubuntu irc there was no one who could help me. in xubuntu thunderbird is standard mail app.
[06:18] <birdfish> fyrestrtr: "welcome to vista" I'm about to throw my vista machine through the window ;)
[06:18] <Macyh> and just cant find the way to bring it back
[06:18] <globe> LuisMendes: are you running gnome?
[06:18] <ochosi> fyrestrtr, is evolution maybe hardcoded in mail-notification?
[06:18] <wrzask_> Hi. Does ubuntu have a nice /etc/init.d interface for iptables-save/iptables-restore?
[06:19] <LuisMendes> globe, yes I am
[06:19] <nothlit> LuisMendes, you need to enable something in your xorg.conf, go recheck your HOWTO
[06:19] <globe> try this at terminal: killall metacity && beryl-manager
[06:19] <nothlit> and restart or hit ctrl+alt+backspace
[06:19] <Destiny123> hello
[06:19] <globe> LuisMendes: its what I needed...
[06:20] <Destiny123> globe: hi
[06:20] <globe> Destiny123: hello
[06:20] <nothlit> Macyh, right click the applications button edit menu and go look for it
[06:21] <LuisMendes> nothlit, Ok, seems I really forgot something
[06:21] <LuisMendes> globe, I'll try, thx
[06:21] <Destiny123> when I type apt-get upgrade it wants to install new versions of firefox and thunderbird. However, I already installed these programs from the websites a few days ago.  How can I remove them from the apt-get upgrade?
[06:21] <AV1611> greeting! here's I just tried to do the ubuntu-610-i386-installation at two machines (three times in general) and every time it refused to mount correctly the NTFS partitions. You have to add it to fstabmanually after the install. Did anybody eperience the same, or that's me is such a lucky person?
[06:21] <AV1611> to mount correctly the NTFS partitions at the install process, I mean
[06:21] <globe> Destiny123: why not just let apt-get install the upgrade?
[06:21] <nothlit> You cannot mount it properly at the install process
[06:21] <Nutubuntu> "Is It Safe?" It seems like every time I upgrade Firefox something goes sour. How's this one working out? Is it safe to install the upgrade? I'm running Dapper ...
[06:21] <nothlit> You have to do it afterwards
[06:22] <nothlit> AV1611, go check ubuntuguide.org to see how
[06:22] <AV1611> why? i did it safely and flawessly atthe deb install p
[06:22] <Destiny123> globe: because they are already installed manually by me 3 days ago!  so how can I stop upgrading asking to install them?
[06:22] <Cosmonaut3030> Nutubuntu: say again, please?
[06:22] <Destiny123> globe: any ideas?
[06:22] <mtlife> can someone tell me..
[06:22] <Macyh> :( sadly i already looked for it over there, i just double checked and it is nowhere to be found
[06:23] <Nutubuntu> Cosmonaut3030 -  Just asking if the upgrade to Firefox/Thunderbird is giving anyone problems, before I go ahead and do it. The last time, I went ahead and spent a day straightening things out afterwards.
[06:23] <mtlife> what exactly are the pro's for an ldap / samba installation?
[06:23] <AV1611> hm, does that mean that's a feature of ubuntu, and not a bug?
[06:23] <globe> Destiny123: there is a way, but I do not know it
[06:23] <Cosmonaut3030> Nutubuntu: You mean 2.0? I had a few issues at first, but those were mainly with extensions, and those have been fixed now.
[06:24] <Nutubuntu> Cosmonaut3030 -  Yes, extensions. JavaScript gave me a series of minor headaches, etc.
[06:24] <Destiny123> globe: heheh ok :P
[06:24] <Nutubuntu> ^ NoScript, I mean. Sorry ...
[06:25] <KatrinaRR> I know this is blasphemy but has anyone succesfully installed yahoomessenger in Ubuntu? I've got a person that says she what's it on here, but I can't get it to meet it's dependancies ..
[06:25] <globe> Destiny123: sorry.... honestly I would just let apt upgrade them.
[06:25] <riddlebox> can anyone get to the mozilla download page to get firebird or thunderbird?
[06:25] <Macyh> cant find the add/remove program option in the edit menu section
[06:25] <Cosmonaut3030> NoScripte works, Nutubuntu. So do most of my other extensions.
[06:25] <Euphidime> I need help with NTFS Access and Nautilus(maybe?). I have read/write access to my NTFS partition, but files with unicode names don't show up
[06:25] <Macyh> it just dissapeared
[06:25] <Nutubuntu> Thanks, Cosmonaut3030 :)    Many thanks.
[06:25] <Cosmonaut3030> But it's a bit weird default
[06:26] <Destiny123> what does this mean when running roootkithunter: - OpenSSL 0.9.8a [ Unknown ] 
[06:26] <Destiny123> anyone know pls?
[06:26] <Macyh> is there any command to bring it up
[06:26] <Macyh> i mean, the add remove option
[06:26] <Destiny123> globe: why upgrade them when they have alerady been upgraded? LOL
[06:27] <globe> Destiny123: to get it to stop pestering you ;-)
[06:27] <trappist> is edgy's kernel supposed to be preemptible? it sure doesn't act like it under heavy i/o load
[06:27] <LjL> !ntfs | Euphidime, have you followed this?
[06:27] <ubotu> Euphidime, have you followed this?: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[06:27] <globe> trappist: as far as I know linux kernels have been preemptible for awhile...
[06:27] <TeemuR> how can i transfer videos to a 5.5generation ipod?
[06:27] <Euphidime> LjL: I just did something with /etc/fstab a friend told me to do, but thanks, I'll read it
[06:28] <trappist> globe: it's a build-time option.  they can be built preemptible or not.
[06:28] <LjL> Euphidime: it has tips for correctly displaying international charsets
[06:28] <Euphidime> Ah, I see it
[06:28] <globe> trappist: hmm....why would you not want preemption?
[06:28] <Euphidime> What do I need to do once I make the change?
[06:28] <trappist> globe: on a server, for example
[06:29] <LjL> Euphidime: unmount and remount the partition
[06:29] <globe> trappist: oh yea....that would make sense
[06:29] <LjL> trappist: why?
[06:29] <Destiny123> LjL: hello
[06:29] <LjL> hi
[06:29] <trappist> LjL: sorry, why what?
[06:30] <Macyh> well, ill try to resume, my add/remove programs option dissapeared weeks ago from my applications menu, tried the edit menu option twice3, but the add/remove option seems nowhere to be found, is there any other way to bring it back? or a console command to open that option??? many thanks
[06:30] <LjL> trappist: why don't you want kernel preemption on a server?
[06:30] <Destiny123> LjL: how can I tell apt-get upgrade to stop telling me it wants to upgrade firefox and thunderbird, because I already installed the latest versions 3 days ago manually?
[06:30] <LjL> Destiny123: how did you install them?
[06:30] <Destiny123> LjL: manually from the mozilla website
[06:31] <njal_> !ndiswrapper
[06:31] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:31] <LjL> Destiny123: so they weren't .deb's, i assume
[06:31] <Destiny123> LjL: no they werent
[06:31] <trappist> LjL: the purpose of it is for a smoother desktop, mostly - so mouse movements can preempt kernel operations like i/o.  I might not want i/o preempted on a kernel, but I'm bringing it up because my desktop acts like I don't have a preemptible kernel.  so I'm asking for a confirmation that the kernel is supposed to be preemptible.
[06:31] <LjL> Destiny123: can't you just let it upgrade them? if you did it right, they should end up in different places anyway
[06:31] <Destiny123> LjL: what would you recommend?
[06:31] <globe> Destiny123: ;-)
[06:31] <trappist> LjL: s/on a kernel/on a server/
[06:31] <Destiny123> LjL: ok! but i was trying to save dl them as im only using dial-up :P
[06:32] <globe> Destiny123: ooooooooohhhh now the picture becomes clear
[06:32] <Destiny123> globe: what picture?
[06:32] <mtyhome> do you know an app to read source emails (including headers, ecc, ecc?)
[06:32] <globe> Destiny123: I was wondering why you didn't want to dl it again....
[06:32] <Euphidime> LjL: Problem fixed, thanks a lot
[06:32] <Macyh> pleeease, im a newbie and feel lost :'(

[06:34] <jonah1980> hi guys does anyone know much about linuxbios i've got amd64 and am curious about if it's worth flashing the bios to linuxbios
[06:34] <nolimitsoya> Macyh, whats the problem?
[06:34] <Macyh> the add remove option dissapeared from the applications menu
[06:34] <Destiny123> globe: hehe ;) yeah because of dial-up :)  dl 20 mb takes forever ;)
[06:34] <Macyh> tried the edit menu option
[06:34] <Macyh> twice
[06:35] <nolimitsoya> jonah1980, bios and operating systems are separate issues
[06:35] <Macyh> but its nowhere to be found
[06:35] <LjL> Destiny123, you probably want to put those packages on hold, i don't remember how though
[06:35] <Macyh> any clues about how bringing it back ???
[06:35] <jonah1980> nolimitsoy, sorry i thought it was worth asking as i only use ubuntu and wanted to know if other ubuntu users had used it and if it's good
[06:36] <globe> Destiny123: you could turn off the synaptic notification option, but that would stop it from notifying you of all upgrades
[06:36] <Destiny123> globe: not a good solution then :P
[06:36] <nolimitsoya> jonah1980, if you are realy fanatic about oss you could try out linuxbios, but featurewice itll be (at best) the same as the manufacturers bios
[06:36] <globe> Destiny123: including kernel upgrades....
[06:36] <Macyh> :'(
[06:37] <globe> Macyh: did you install any programs or change anything before it dissappeared?
[06:37] <jonah1980> nolimitsoya, hmm i'm not really a fanatic - i guess i'll stick with what i have thanks for the advice
[06:38] <Macyh> nothing special globe
[06:38] <Jinkguns_> :|
[06:38] <Jinkguns_> I keep losing connection to the network

=== Gotti is now known as jr
[06:38] <globe> Macyh: what do you need from it...maybe there is a way around
=== jr is now known as jrgotti
[06:39] <Macyh> i want to have it back, its quite a clear option for a newbie to install an uninstall stuff
[06:40] <Macyh> its gone
[06:40] <njal_> I have a usb wireless card installed using ndiswrapper and the driver and hardware are present but network-manager wont allow it to connect
[06:40] <globe> Macyh: have you tried searching on google?
[06:40] <gtwy> ah, it seems the smb client was not compatable with vista
[06:40] <Macyh> i tried the wiki
[06:41] <gtwy> but the latest version is
[06:41] <Macyh> but it just tells me about the use of it, not how bring it up
[06:41] <gtwy> is there a way to force an upgrade even though the respository doesnt have it yet?
[06:41] <gtwy> sorry im used to portage/emerge this ubuntu stuff is new to me
[06:42] <nolimitsoya> how is support for xfi comming along?
[06:42] <zever> Macyh, try gnome-app-install in terminal
[06:42] <globe> Macyh: okay...lets do something else.  gimme a sec to test it, but we'll try and make a new launcher for it
[06:42] <Macyh> all right

[06:44] <Macyh> no idea zever,
[06:44] <zever> Macyh, try sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-app-install
[06:44] <Macyh> i once looked for it in order to install something and there was no trace of it
[06:44] <trappist> LjL: # CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set (checked it before) but other PREEMPT variables are set to 'y'
[06:45] <Macyh> did not work zever
[06:45] <LjL> trappist: same here. as to what exactly that means..
[06:45] <zever> Macyh, what does it say?
[06:45] <soplix> hey. sometimes the screen starts to flicker and the colors gets strange. what can that be?
[06:45] <trappist> LjL: right.  that's why I was asking :)
[06:45] <globe> Macyh: try "/usr/bin/gnome-app-install"
[06:46] <Macyh> sory
[06:46] <Macyh> trying again
[06:46] <globe> soplix: is you monitor cable plugged in all the way...I had that problem
[06:46] <Macyh> did not copy the whole code

[06:46] <Macyh> yes
[06:46] <Macyh> it is
[06:47] <Macyh> how did you find the answer???? so i know in the future if something simmilar happens?
[06:47] <soplix> globe: i've got a laptop and I surpose the cable should be fine. it haven't happened before in windows
[06:47] <globe> Macyh: was it the command I gave you, or something else (thinking ahead for when it breaks for me)
[06:47] <Macyh> sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-app-install
[06:47] <Macyh> that was
[06:47] <globe> soplix: lol...probably is if it is a laptop
[06:47] <globe> Macyh: okay...cool
[06:47] <Macyh> sorry, i do not remember who wrote it :S
[06:47] <zever> Macyh, it just reinstalls the program

[06:47] <Macyh> wicked

[06:48] <globe> lol
[06:48] <Macyh> well
[06:48] <Macyh> now im here just another wquestion
[06:48] <globe> soplix: do you have the correct drivers?
[06:48] <Macyh> is there any way to emulate a macintosh over ubuntu?
[06:49] <Macyh> thanks for the solution by the way
[06:49] <globe> Macyh: what part of mac?....
[06:49] <KatrinaRR> hello all .. am I correct in thinking to add a user as administrator via cli in Ubuntu is: usermod -a sudo <username>?
[06:49] <Macyh> just a normal mac computer so i can run mac os x over it
[06:49] <globe> Macyh: you want to run osx on top of ubotu?
[06:49] <trappist> KatrinaRR: sudo visudo, and add an appropriate line for the new user
[06:50] <Macyh> yes, i do not know if its possible
[06:50] <KatrinaRR> trappist: that doesn't look familiar for me .. visudo? so .. sudo visudo <username>?
[06:50] <globe> Macyh: oh, like running osx programs on ubuntu?
[06:50] <Macyh> no no
[06:50] <KatrinaRR> I just need to add a user so she can set up her printer
[06:51] <Macyh> just launch a macintosh emulator
[06:51] <Macyh> like wine
[06:51] <trappist> KatrinaRR: 'visudo' opens /etc/sudoers (the file that needs to be modified) in your text editor in a safe way
[06:51] <globe> Macyh: do you want to run the entire OSX system, or just some programs for OSX?
[06:51] <Macyh> the entire osx system
[06:53] <njal_> anyone know how to use ndiswrapper?
[06:53] <globe> Macyh: there is a program called mac-on-linux (MOL) which might do what you want. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1752456
[06:53] <globe> Macyh: but it will only run on a PowerPC, not intel chip
[06:54] <Macyh> ummm
[06:54] <iter> Macyh: if you're hell bent on running macosx there are installers out there that will run on intel chips
[06:54] <Macyh> i have an intel chip
[06:54] <iter> Macyh: they're pirated though

[06:56] <Macyh> all right
[06:56] <globe> soplix: does it only happen in gui?
[06:56] <Macyh> so i guess its not that easy
[06:56] <Macyh> xD
[06:56] <globe> Macyh: not so much...the apple stores usually have demo machines ;-)
[06:57] <Macyh> how?
[06:57] <globe> Macyh: meaning that they have apple computers running osx...
[06:57] <soplix> globe: it doesn't happen often so I don't know if it will happen without gui
[06:58] <globe> soplix: it just freaks out every so often?
[06:59] <trappist> LjL: thanks, after reading that $10 says it's because I'm using reiserfs.

[07:07] <kevinG> when i try to run a session with glx i can only see my mouse and a black screen then it takes me back to the login screen
[07:07] <globe> soplix: try decreasing it and see if that helps.  if so, you probably don't hav the independent video ram
[07:07] <soplix> it said something about dedicated local video memory. do you know what that is?
[07:07] <graft> uhm... kevinG what card have you got?
[07:07] <globe> chrisbittner: one sec
[07:07] <kevinG> nvidia 7800gtx
[07:07] <sami> chrisbittner: Install ati driver via synaptic, Its easy way.
[07:08] <dfgas> any idea on this? i have a server running ubuntu, when my windows machine is playing music from it it is fine, but when this computer running ubuntu is playing it it takes a bit for each song to come up and sometimes it skips also
[07:08] <chrisbittner> ok i'll try that
[07:08] <graft> kevinG: and you're not trying to run an Xgl server or anything, are you?
[07:09] <soplix> globe:  it said something about dedicated local video memory. do you know what that is?
[07:09] <kevinG> graft: i was trying to run one, and that's when i got the black screen that took me back to the login
[07:09] <globe> soplix: yes.  its when a video card has its own memory onboard.  shared video memory means that it uses the system memory, and must use the system bus to use it (ie. slow).
[07:09] <kevinG> so i am using the default session right now
[07:09] <graft> kevinG: you understand the difference between an Xgl server and an X server running glx, right?
[07:09] <Gasten> Hi. To get the package-manager to unpack rar-files, what package should I apt-get?
[07:09] <globe> soplix: my laptop has that junk....shared memory
[07:09] <Gasten> !rar
[07:09] <ubotu> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[07:09] <kevinG> wait...
[07:09] <boink> Gasten: apt-cache search rar
[07:10] <kevinG> damnit...the xgl glx confused me..haha
[07:10] <Jinkguns_> There is something sexy about pulling research data off of 10 year old SyQuest propreitary and went out of business disks via a external drive connected by SCSI using Linux, which somehow knows what the heck to do with the drive, disks and filesystems.
[07:10] <LjL> boink: wow, that's useful
[07:10] <Gasten> boink: I have done that, but there is way too many packages!
[07:10] <boink> heh, just pipe it to less :P
[07:10] <graft> dfgas: what are you playing it with? maybe you're just using a really crappy audio layer
[07:10] <globe> Jinkguns_: :-)
[07:10] <kevinG> well...when i use glxgears, i get this message
[07:11] <Sobert> does anyone know when the libapache2-mod-mono package version will be the correct one ? it's 1.1.13 and the package in edgy is supposed to be 1.1.17 at least. Is there someone to mail ? Or just wait ?
[07:11] <LjL> !info unrar | Gasten
[07:11] <ubotu> unrar: Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version). In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:3.5.4-0.1 (edgy), package size 84 kB, installed size 216 kB

[07:11] <kevinG> Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0". Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
[07:11] <kevinG> so i know it isn't setup properly
[07:11] <boink> if you do apt-cache show rar, that gives you more details
[07:11] <boink> rar_3.30-2ubuntu2_i386.deb
[07:11] <LjL> boink: 'cept that's for compressing, not for extracting ;)
[07:11] <globe> soplix: if you know the model number of the laptop, google it.
[07:11] <kevinG> does it have anything to do with changing the "nv" line to "nvidia"?
[07:11] <Macyh> great
[07:11] <graft> kevinG: what driver are you using? the non-free one?
[07:11] <Macyh> it works
[07:11] <boink> unrar is what you need
[07:12] <dfgas> graft: xmms, they are mp3s
[07:12] <Macyh> thank you again
[07:12] <boink> again, apt-cache show unrar
[07:12] <graft> dfgas: no, i mean what does xmms play via?
[07:12] <kevinG> graft: i'm not sure...i'm using the one that easyubuntu downloads
[07:12] <boink> unrar-free - Unarchiver for .rar files
[07:12] <boink> unrar - Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version)
[07:12] <graft> kevinG: if you're using 'nvidia', that's the non-free one
[07:12] <dfgas> graft: alsa?
[07:12] <graft> kevinG: if you're using 'nv', it might not work
[07:12] <kevinG> well, it shows up as "nv" by default
[07:13] <LjL> boink: yes, the point is that he was already pointed to the appropriate page (and then later i did !info unrar), so no need to apt-cache much
[07:13] <kevinG> hmm...last time i used easyubuntu it set everything up properly
[07:13] <kevinG> i must have undid something while i was trying to get xgl to work
[07:13] <graft> kevinG: it won't install the non-free driver by default, probably
[07:13] <dfgas> graft: the orignal mpef layer 1/2/3
[07:13] <globe> kevinG: 3d accel wont work very well unless you use the beta drivers from nvidia (imo)
[07:13] <graft> dfgas: no, i meant alsa...

[07:18] <TSWoodV> Question concerning window managers:  Say I had gnome, kde, and xfce4 all installed on a Edgy box.  What's the best way to switch back and forth between them?  Fedora has a program called "system-switch-desktop" that does the trick.  What's ubuntu's equivalent?
[07:19] <jrib> TSWoodV: you can select which one you want to use at the login screen ("options" button in the corner)
[07:19] <soplix> globe: it used shared video memory
[07:19] <globe> TSWoodV: if you log off then log back on, you can choose from sessions
[07:19] <globe> soplix: I figured.
[07:20] <TSWoodV> jrib: How do I set the default one?  Having installed Ubuntu first, now wanting xfce4 as the default, how do I set this?
[07:20] <bhudda> globe Do you know how to get beryl to be the window frame manager at login, instead of having to click "reload window frame manager" from the beryl manager?
[07:20] <soplix> globe: that means that there was a problem with the video card and the driver. crap!
[07:20] <jrib> TSWoodV: when you select to login with xfce, it will ask you if you want it to be default

[07:22] <globe> bhudda: yes. near the end of this how-to it explains it. http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
[07:22] <bhudda> glove thanks,
[07:22] <Crescendo> scheuri, I recommended that he set the new drive as master, the windoze drive as slave, and install ubuntu - GRUB should be automatically configured, right?
[07:22] <globe> bhudda: sure

[07:23] <DanaG> You can also use the 'map' option in Grub.
[07:23] <DanaG> Perhaps google for grub windows map
[07:23] <KatrinaRR> I've got a problem .. when I attempt to ssh into my sister-in-laws computer (she needs to get her printer going) it stops me, I looked and she has port 80 open, how to I tell ssh to use that port instead of 22? ssh -X justin@<her IP>:80?>
[07:23] <scheuri> Crescendo: I do not know...as I never tried it...I always use diff HDD in a rack
[07:23] <Crescendo> Yeah, he's using a different HDD for Ubuntu.
[07:23] <justin_> Nope it's not that I guess its "Gnome" something
[07:24] <TSWoodV> Nasty downside to having xubuntu-desktop and gnome-desktop on the same box.  Whichever is installed last overwrites such desktop apps as terminal, etc.
[07:24] <Crescendo> DanaG, I don't know what you're talking about, I don't think he will either...
[07:24] <Crescendo> He's a 100% linux newb. :/
[07:24] <chrisbittner> what does it mean when it says i need to run the installer as a "super User"
[07:24] <DanaG> Windows wants to be on primary master.
[07:24] <scheuri> Crescendo: well, yes....but not solely...
[07:24] <DanaG> So if you make it slave, you have to make Grub virtually 'swap' the drives.
[07:24] <scheuri> Crescendo: then I would recommand to buy racks
[07:24] <globe> chrisbittner: run the same command, prefix with sudo
[07:24] <TSWoodV> Crescendo: The drive that grub selects will be dependent on BIOS settings and the order they are detected.  Run
[07:24] <ere> I have problems with ACPI and Dell Latitude Laptops. D810 does not work at all. D50X works, but not reliably. Anyone have suggestions on how to debug ACPI problems?
[07:25] <DanaG> http://blog.firetree.net/2005/08/26/duel-boot-windows-with-grub/
[07:25] <TSWoodV> Crescendo: Run "grub-install --recheck" and you'll see the order in which the drives are checked.
[07:25] <DanaG> so then you can chainload to whichever partition is the Vista bootloader.
[07:25] <graveson> where do i find out about supported hardware. is core 2 duo supported,because i cannot install dapper
[07:25] <Jinkguns_> ere, have you taken a look at linuxlaptops.net? They have a step by step debugging guide for various popular and unpoplar models of laptops
=== globe is now known as globe_brb_foodti
[07:25] <Crescendo> Right - I remember doing it the same way a while back, can't remember the specifics, but the default install automatically detected the windows drive - I want to make sure he doesn't have to do any messing around, it'll do the same for him.

[07:26] <kuja> Let's say I want to boot the LiveCD ISO off a certain partition of my external harddrive, how would I do that?

[07:29] <DanaG> The new BCD is in the vista partition.
[07:29] <Crescendo> Will ubuntu setup detect the windows drive and configure itself?
[07:29] <DanaG> Before installing Vista, make the partition beforehand and 'activate' it (set 'boot' flag)
[07:29] <VladimirBG> ok, I have universe, mulitverse and restricted sleceted, refreshed synaptic and still now realplayer
[07:30] <TSWoodV> DanaG: So it's just the standard chainloader routine, right?
[07:30] <DanaG> Otherwise it steals XP as D: and won't let you change it.
[07:30] <Crescendo> ...
[07:30] <DanaG> Yeah, same chainloader.  Note that all mine are on one drive.
[07:31] <TSWoodV> Crescendo:  If grub finds more than one bootable device onto which it can install itself, it doesn't always make the best choice.  It has a particular order, somewhat dictated by BIOS settings and kernel pecking order, that tells it which drive to use when you install it.
[07:31] <Crescendo> Correct, and I already told him to set the windows drive as slave and the new drive as master, which I just told you.
[07:31] <Crescendo> Will he have any problems?
[07:31] <TSWoodV> Crescendo: Sometimes it'll try to install grub to the "wrong" drive.  Usually, though, this is on a machine that has two hard drives with linux partitions on them.
[07:32] <DanaG> If Windows drive is slave, you'll need to use the 'map' option so Windows doesn't get confused.
[07:32] <TSWoodV> Crescendo: Master/slave settings may or may not be the "fix" here.
[07:32] <Crescendo> No, he doesn't have Linux partitions at all.  He's never used Linux.
[07:32] <Crescendo> What is an option?

[07:33] <JRlinux> My laptop has broadcom 4318 ... does the wireless solution necessarily entail ndiswrapper?
[07:33] <DanaG> and 'map (hd1) (hd0)'
[07:33] <DanaG> It swaps which drive is seen as master.
[07:33] <TSWoodV> DanaG: I usually run "grub-install --recheck" and figure out what grub is detecting.  Then, figuring that grub-install with pick the first hard disk in that list, if that's what I want, then I'm fine.  Otherwise, I've got to tell it the proper drive.

Take heart, though, that this isn't as straightforward as it might seem at first glance.  But it's not that difficult to discern the correct way to install grub.

[07:36] <JRlinux> alecjw, OK.  Ubuntu does seem to know it is a broadcom 43xxxx, because it boots with that info-- but it does not do anything with that info.

[07:36] <DanaG> Oh, and the correct ndiswrapper packages are the 1.8 ones.

[07:44] <ashzilla> TSWoodV: This is interesting... An nmap scan returned that the box is linux. How weird.
[07:44] <TSWoodV> craigbass1976: First, you've renamed the [dialer-defaults]  section to [dialer-cyber] .  Now you have to explicitly call that newly named section.  I'd rename it back to the defaults.
[07:45] <TSWoodV> craigbass1976: [Dialer Defaults}
[07:45] <TSWoodV> craigbass1976: [Dialer Defaults] 
[07:45] <TSWoodV> craigbass1976: Can't type today...
[07:45] <Romeo_1> hey guys, is it possible to get installation packages not directly using Ubuntu?
[07:46] <Romeo_1> i mean can i download that packages and install them on other computer which is not connected to internet?
[07:46] <ere> Romeo_1: yes
[07:46] <Romeo_1> i couldn't find that packages on ubuntu's offsite
[07:46] <ashzilla> TSWoodV: this looks promising, thanks for the link.
[07:46] <Romeo_1> could anyone help me with this?
[07:47] <rioghal> Romeo_1, yes, hold on i will get you a url
[07:47] <sewoyl> so anyone can help me with DAAP functionnality in banshee?
[07:47] <TSWoodV> craigbass1976: And I'd move all the other stuff (lines 2-8) under [Dialer Defaults]  as well.
[07:47] <TSWoodV> ashzilla: No problem.  That should work out for you.
[07:47] <Romeo_1> dude, i'd be much obliged
[07:47] <Romeo_1> thx in advance
[07:47] <rioghal> Romeo_1, http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/
[07:48] <Romeo_1> rioghal thank you very much
[07:48] <\login> hey, does the base system need to use ext2 or can i use ext3 or whatever i like?
[07:49] <`4aFkA`> hello!
[07:49] <rioghal> Romeo_1, basically you can open your /etc/apt/sources.list file and go to any of the official repos and follow the "pool" links
[07:49] <livingdaylig> Anyone use Opera here? I'm trying to figure out how to add flash to my opera
[07:49] <MarcN> sewoyl: what is the problem? DAAP works fine for me using Rhythmbox, listen and others.  Don't happen to have banshee and banshee-daap installed currently
[07:50] <sewoyl> MarcN, DAAP server works well
[07:50] <`4aFkA`> i'm having problem with setting up the connection...i'm using internet try proxy and i don't know how to configure the local ip addresses and the proxies :/ any help pls ??
[07:50] <Romeo_1> rioghal the problem is that the computer running on Ubuntu is temporary not connected to Internet (for some reasons) but i want some software to install, that's why i'd like to get those packages and install them later
[07:51] <sewoyl> MarcN: now when I'm a client (itunes serving) The source appears in the list, but it freezes the whole program when I click 'import songs from source'
[07:51] <sewoyl> MarcN: Im using banshee and banshee-daap from edgy repositories (possibly universe)
[07:51] <rioghal> Romeo_1, ok, visit that url on a box that has a connection, download what you want, burn to cd, take it to the other box and install.. but you may have a problem with deps
[07:51] <rioghal> Romeo_1, unless you already know which deps you need and dl those too
[07:52] <\login> will there be problems if i have / using ex2 and /home using reiserfs,if i got to move files between systems.?
[07:52] <livingdaylig> Anyone?
[07:52] <Romeo_1> rioghal anyways, i'm downloading them, and I'll try to install them as you've stated. Hope won't be any problems
[07:52] <TSWoodV> \login: If you mean problems using cp or mv between filesystems, or even things like tar and cpio, then no.
[07:52] <trench-> n00b question: can i update my edgy kernel using Adept? or i have to compile manually
[07:52] <\login> TSWoodV:tnx ;)
[07:53] <TSWoodV> livingdaylig: Try the new flash beta 2 from Adobe.  Go to their website and try that out.
[07:53] <MarcN> sewoyl: ah.  I use mt-daap on my debian/testing server to serve music to my ubuntu laptop running rhythmbox or Listen and my wife's iTunes Windows box.  No problems.  Same for serving from rhythmbox to another rhythmbox.     Maybe try another client?
[07:53] <rioghal> Romeo_1, i used that method on a box without a conn, but u had to go back and forth due to the various deps. some apps have a lot of deps.. some dont have many
[07:53] <litropy> Hi, all - I'm getting error messages upon apt-get install like this: Failed to fetch http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz/dists/edgy/Release  Unable to find expected entry  main-edgy/binary-powerpc/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
[07:53] <livingdaylig> Anyone use Opera here? I'm trying to figure out how to add flash to my opera
[07:53] <litropy> see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304204 for more info
[07:54] <sewoyl> MarcN, i tried connecting using rhythmbox, there it just loops on 'retrieving songs'
[07:54] <livingdaylig> TSWoodV: huh? opera doesn't work with flash9
[07:54] <rioghal> litropy, automatix?
[07:54] <sewoyl> MarcN, I think the itunes is configured properly
[07:54] <livingdaylig> TSWoodV: using Linux Mint
[07:54] <litropy> rioghal: I don't understand
[07:54] <rioghal> litropy, nevermind
[07:55] <TSWoodV> livingdaylig: Mint sounds interesting, but you should be able to use automatix on ubuntu and get what Mint brings to the table.
[07:55] <scheuri> !automatix
[07:55] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[07:55] <rioghal> TsN|Hunter, please dont recommend automatix in here
[07:55] <savvas> how can i rip audio from a .wmv movie?
[07:55] <litropy> ah. rioghal, no automatix
[07:55] <sewoyl> I've used automatix once, and it does indeed break the system ...good if you don't plan on upgrading anything but hsouldnt use it probably
[07:55] <TSWoodV> Despite scheuri and ubotu's statement, if you're careful with your selections, it works ok.  It *can* hurt you, but it doesn't have to.
[07:56] <craig_> Grrr... got disconnected.  TSWoodV did you respond to my wvdial.conf link?  I kept trying to come back, but apparently when you leave freenode abruptly, you're still kind of here and can't log ing again.
[07:56] <scheuri> rioghal: what would be the alternative?
[07:56] <scheuri> TSWoodV: I made a statement? ;)
[07:56] <chrisbittner> im having trouble getting my graphics card installed..........i guess i just cant find the right drivers for it.....
[07:56] <rioghal> scheuri, learn how to do things yourself? seriously, if you learn how to do things, then you know how to fix problems when they arise.
[07:57] <sewoyl> chrisbittner: whats your card?
[07:57] <craig_> TSWoodV, and my original quesiotn, about dialing out with ubuntu livecd... is wvdial borks on Fedora, is it going to do the same thing un Ubuntu, or not necessarily?
[07:57] <scheuri> rioghal: sure, "do it yourself and learn it" is better...still...somethings can be automated and why re-invent the wheels
[07:57] <TSWoodV> craig_: Yep, it's locked your old handle for a while.  First, run "man wvdial" and look at your options.  The crux of your problem is that your wvdial.conf file is a mess.  I'd stick all of the stuff in the modem section below the [Default Dialer]  (name this back the way it was) section and try again.
[07:57] <chrisbittner> ati radeon x1900 gt
[07:57] <chrisbittner> how do i check if its installed?
[07:57] <TSWoodV> scheuri: You made a statement via ubotu proxy about automatix.
[07:58] <TSWoodV> scheuri: I rarely let bots speak for me ;-) LOL!
[07:58] <savvas> is it possible to rip audio from a .wmv (windows media video) file?
[07:58] <scheuri> TSWoodV: ah, right...well....litropy didnt know what automatix was...that is why I did it...;)...but hey...why not using a bot when it can speak for you...;)
[07:58] <rioghal> scheuri, theres no substitution for knowledge
[07:58] <TSWoodV> craig_: I've used wvdial on Fedora extensively, not on Ubuntu at all, but it's very straightforward.  I would expect no problems under Ubuntu.
[07:58] <sewoyl> chrisbittner: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide Looks like it would work
[07:58] <TSWoodV> scheuri: LOL!
[07:59] <scheuri> rioghal: of course there is not...I am with you there very much...:)...I am just asking as I thought there are others...
[07:59] <hentai> how can i find out where the artwiz fonts stored onto my computer when they installed?
[07:59] <savvas> rioghal: in a capitalistic world there is always money :p
[07:59] <hentai> i used the xfonts-artwiz package
[07:59] <rioghal> hahaha
[08:00] <bhudda> grr
[08:00] <rioghal> scheuri, i learned my lesson when i 'automated' something and it broke my internet connection.. i was so screwed
[08:00] <craig_> TSWoodV, well, maybe you can give me a hand then.  I can dial out in minicom, but copying the init strings over dont' work.
[08:00] <MarcN> sewoyl: do you have lots of music?  It can be somewhat slow. Check CPU and network loads to see what is doing
[08:00] <fredJones840> so which one is better .. ubuntu or xubuntu?
[08:00] <izmaelis> what option in xorg.cong should I set to enable edge between to of my monitors? mosue walks between them without any "flip" as I want it to
[08:01] <scheuri> rioghal: well...done that several times...the screwing things...;)
[08:01] <craig_> hey, I'm craig.... just noticed I'm not craigbass1976...
[08:01] <sewoyl> MarcN: I checked the network traffic, it peaks at the very starts then falls back down at normal level (a few %s)
[08:01] <Romeo_1> rioghal one more thing, I don't really understand the differences between different Linux versions but i got only Ubuntu installation CD, what do you think - is it a good choice? or it will be pain to use for a newbie like me?
[08:01] <MarcN> fredJones840: which is better chocolate or vanilla?   Depends on personal preferences.
[08:01] <fredJones840> it doesnt look like xubuntu has as much stuff as ubuntu
[08:02] <fredJones840> hmm .. good poin t
[08:02] <TSWoodV> craig_: You rarely need a full-blown init string.  "ATZ" is usually enough with modern modems.
[08:02] <fredJones840> have you used both?
[08:02] <MarcN> fredJones840: and don't forget you can have swirled choc and vanilla.  (ie: both gnome, kde, X desktop apps all in use at once)
[08:02] <TLE> is there a tool, other than something in gdesklets or gonky, that lets you see the temperature of your cpu ?
[08:02] <rioghal> Romeo_1, i have been through several distros, including fedora debian archlinux centos mepis, and i feel that ubuntu is the downright best distro available. its easy to use and easy to learn.
[08:02] <sewoyl> fredJones840: xubuntu (so with the xfce desktop) is a lot younger than gnome
[08:03] <fredJones840> i c ..
[08:03] <sewoyl> fredJones840: xubuntu would work a bit faster on slwoer machines
[08:03] <Kingsqueak> TLE a bunch, gkrellm has plugins for that and there should be wmaker docklets too
[08:03] <homecable> waiting for my iso do to download

[08:03] <Romeo_1> rioghal, can i install apache/mysql stuff and use on network like a server with Ubuntu desktop or should i install Server version?
[08:03] <Kingsqueak> TLE: apt-cache search sensors
[08:04] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: you can install those on regular ubuntu
[08:04] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: and you'll get your UI too ^^
[08:04] <Romeo_1> sewoyl thanx
[08:04] <fredJones840> ok ive got a plan .. thanks for the input MarcN and sewoy1
[08:04] <linuxvampire> anyone seen LInuxMint yet?
[08:04] <rioghal> Romeo_1, i have LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL Php) installed on my desktop pc and i love it.
[08:04] <sewoyl> no problem
[08:05] <Romeo_1> rioghal i tried LAMP but got some problems that i couldn't solve with vhosts
[08:05] <Romeo_1> :/
[08:05] <TLE> Kingsqueak: thanks
[08:05] <rioghal> Romeo_1, well, youre in a good channel to get that solved. also have a look at ubuntuforums.org  that is one nice forum
[08:05] <savvas> Romeo_1: tried xampp ?
[08:06] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: if you install apache, php and mysql on ubuntu you'll get LAMP !
[08:06] <Romeo_1> savvas xampp for Ubuntu? I thought it's only for Windows...
[08:06] <Romeo_1> rioghal thanx, i'll be here then for a while =)
[08:06] <savvas> well..
[08:06] <savvas> dunno
[08:06] <savvas> :p
[08:06] <savvas> just a suggestion:\
[08:07] <fredJones840> isnt linuxmint based on a kubuntu dist.?
[08:07] <Romeo_1> savvas well i guess LAMP is the same but for linux
[08:07] <rioghal> savvas, what is xampp?
[08:07] <alecjw> how can i transfer pictures to my ipod? what format should i use?
[08:07] <bieb_work> I need some help restoring the groups to the default user
[08:08] <Romeo_1> rioghal the as LAMP but for Windows
[08:08] <savvas> rioghal: same as lamp, i think the difference would be myadmin.. or something..
[08:08] <rioghal> oh, ok
[08:08] <linuxvampire> the new linux mint is based on gnome
[08:08] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: LAMP = Linux + Apache + Mysql+ Php/Perl
[08:08] <linuxvampire> I just installed it, its pretty nice so far.
[08:08] <ashzilla> TSWoodV: This didn't work out. Apparently that was either too difficult (or did the configuration on the remote end was different than what was used in the guide)
[08:08] <linuxvampire> just wondering if I was the only guy using it :P
[08:08] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: so there is no such things as 'LAMP for Linux'
[08:09] <fredJones840> cool
[08:09] <linuxvampire> woot
[08:09] <fredJones840> what do u hav? LinuxMint 1.0 Beta?
[08:09] <linuxvampire> this makes me glad I lugged my computer to my sisters house and leeched her DSL
[08:09] <linuxvampire> 2.0
[08:10] <linuxvampire> *finds a URL*
[08:10] <sewoyl> MarcN: do you think rebooting owuld solve anything ? (I know, I know ... thats an old windows reflex^^)
[08:10] <fredJones840> haha fosho
[08:10] <Hoxx> anyone know if theres a place for xchat themes??
[08:10] <sewoyl> MarcN: Im still taking about that DAAP thing
[08:10] <linuxvampire> also got fluxbuntu in case I need more space on my laptop lol
[08:10] <Romeo_1> sewoyl i meant xampp is same as LAMP but for Windows =)
[08:10] <bieb_work> I was trying to learn how to use usermod -G and overwrote all the groups the default user was a member of, I hove booted into the recovery console how can I add multiple groups at once?
[08:10] <FirstStrike> hmm, linux mint? :>
[08:10] <fredJones840> yea this is what i found in a quick search
[08:10] <fredJones840> http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/linuxmint/releases/?fl=
[08:10] <MarcN> sewoyl: nope.  Try other apps or combinations.
[08:10] <rioghal> Hoxx, xchat uses gtk2 themes, changing the gnome theme changes the xchat theme
[08:10] <sewoyl> Romeo_1: ok:)
[08:10] <Jural> Hello, wondering if anyone can point me to a link for ubuntu install from a console. X is freezing on fresh system install
[08:11] <rioghal> Hoxx, but you can change the xchat colors though
[08:11] <linuxvampire> http://lt.k1011.nutime.de/      <--linuxmint
[08:11] <sewoyl> MarcN: OK, thanks ... I dont know though ...my bro's pc is MacOSX
[08:11] <linuxvampire> hehe, OSX Aqua? :D
[08:11] <MarcN> sewoyl: on your side then.
[08:11] <sewoyl> MarcN: I've ranout of ideas after banshee and rhythbox ...I could figure out if amarok had daap client functionnalities
[08:11] <Hoxx> rioghal: ye but imo theyre so messy, cant really figure out which color # changes which :/
[08:12] <ales_> Command "man fg" or "man jobs" gives me "No manual entry for fg".  What package should I install to get manuals for those commands?
[08:12] <fredJones840> ah cool
[08:12] <Hoxx> rioghal:  so now i have all colors grey :P
[08:12] <graft> amarok has a daap client
[08:12] <graft> it's not very good yet
[08:12] <linuxvampire> rhythmbox reminds me of itunes without that sexy visualization..
[08:12] <litropy> guys, I've been trying to figure this out for days and no one seems to know what've up. I've gained absolutely no ground; any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Once again, seegain, see
[08:12] <rioghal> Hoxx, yeah i tried messing with the colors and it took me a while to get them right
[08:12] <litropy> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1788570#post1788570 for more info; thanks in advance
[08:12] <craig_> TSWoodV, ok, I've got ubuntu burned.  You think I have to install something else to make this modem work, or are all the tools on the cd?
[08:12] <savvas> linuxvampire: wait for songbird to go stable
[08:13] <linuxvampire> *googles songbird*
[08:13] <linuxvampire> why wait for stable though? :(
[08:13] <craig_> TSWoodV, and will it matter if I have an ethernet connection at the same time?
[08:13] <Breetai> Hi all, I am not sure if this is the right place to ask the question or not, so here I go....
[08:13] <savvas> linuxvampire: well if you like bug crawling, please do try the nightly builds :P
[08:13] <alecjw> how can i transfer pictures to my ipod? what format should i use?
[08:13] <linuxvampire> beta-testing is the best part! *I discovered <generic app> 9 months before you NOOB!*
[08:13] <Hoxx> rioghal: ye seems like i have to do the same :/ or u can upload a screenshot of your your color settings for all the world to see :)

[08:15] <MarcN> meisam: why not use the ubuntu provided package?
[08:15] <Breetai> Since moving to 6.10 edgy, I have some simple X apps that no longer run. They are dock apps and a simple icon manager. They all die with X errors. I am sure it has to do with the xorg file as set up by edgy. If I run a vncserver on a "virtual' display they work fine. And in 6.06, I only had that problem when I used the radeon drivers instead of the ati driver (which 6.10 is also using by default) Any idea on what to change in X to fix this?
[08:15] <meisam> MarcN this is the new version
[08:16] <alecjw> craig_: it does, but ipod doesn't work like that. you don't just drag files into the drive -you have to use progrmas
[08:16] <alecjw> to update the itunes db and the like
[08:16] <DanaG> That's why when I get a media player it won't be iPod.
[08:16] <j3di> just did a server install .. trying to add a repository.. (supository HAHHAH) too much of a n00b to figure it out.. help

[08:17] <meisam> If you have readline already installed, see config.log for details on the

[08:18] <savvas> Morrissey: enemy-territory (et.filefront.com)
[08:18] <linuxvampire> globe: yeah, use enlightenment :)
[08:18] <MarcN> meisam: you are missing some dev libraries.  Try apt-get build-deb postgresql-common   to have all the dev libraries installed, then try compiling pg from source
[08:18] <linuxvampire> there's quite a few animated desktop wallpapers for that already.
[08:18] <ashzilla> graft, songbird is amazing :)
[08:18] <novo> anybody know how can I check if my vga card is installed correclty??
[08:18] <Morrissey> savvas, unfortinally it didnt work with my widescreen Laptop .. couldnt fix it either (run 1200x800)
[08:18] <Noah0504> How do I get spell check to work in XChat?  It works by default under Edgy, but not so under Dapper.
[08:18] <savvas> graft: it's still under heavy construction, so it's better to wait for a beta release than a preview one
[08:18] <sally_> how do I find out what files are in a package from the command line?
[08:19] <linuxvampire> I use it on xubuntu on my laptop :)

[08:20] <linuxvampire> hey, I just found a bug/snafu/oversight in one of the linmodem tutorials for edgy :)

[08:22] <savvas> sally_: you can see the available commands by just typing: apt-cache
[08:22] <graft> rioghal: you know, i'm not really sure... :P
[08:22] <cablop_> hello everybody
[08:22] <rioghal> graft, hahaha
[08:23] <linuxvampire> yay the new driver works (for when I go home, and leave this spiffy DSL for dialup..)
[08:23] <linuxvampire> *sniffle&
[08:23] <novo> metres:I cannot execute that
[08:23] <MarcN> meisam: $ sudo apt-get build-dep postgresql-common
[08:23] <MarcN> Reading package lists... Done
[08:24] <cablop> gr
[08:24] <cablop> im still here
[08:24] <ashzilla> Is it possible to launch two server windows in one IRSSI window?
[08:24] <globe> ashzilla: I think so...I remember doing it
[08:25] <meisam> MarcN im sorry ...E: Could not open file /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_multiverse_source_Sources - open (2 No such file or directory)
[08:25] <linuxvampire> ashzilla: just go /server <blah>, then its like ALT+RIGHT
[08:25] <linuxvampire> or something similar
[08:25] <linuxvampire> probably alt+space+right
[08:25] <globe> ashzilla: yea, what he said
[08:25] <Morrissey> graft, too bad amarok doesnt play movies ... amarok's great!
[08:25] <linuxvampire> well um, that's close, I know it aint right :D
[08:26] <novo> <sawas>:I have installed the video card, but I'm not sure if it is well configured
[08:26] <savvas> er back to my question: how can i rip audio from a windows media video format?
[08:26] <garrett_novo>  I just got kubuntu installed and I did a kernel update via adept.  When I rebooted my atheros drivers didn't load.  I tried manually loading them and found that they didn't automatically get rebuilt for the new kernel.  Is there an easy way to rebuild all modules when I get a kernel update?
[08:26] <nofxx> savvas , FFMPEG
[08:26] <Klarre> hi everyone!
[08:26] <graft> Morrissey: yeah, but it has its flaws... frankly i think they're kind of clueless about interface stuff
[08:26] <dcordes> how can i run a program on the active graphical xserver while i am on tty1?
[08:27] <fredJones840> barbara looks pretty interesting .. dling now . heh
[08:27] <savvas> nofxx: a bit more specific pls? i get some errors while trying ffmpeg
[08:27] <synjet> hi! I was wondering if anybody had probs with Opera 9.02 freezing on Edgy Eft every now and then?
[08:27] <fredJones840> ill try it out 4 a min
[08:27] <linuxvampire> hm
[08:27] <Morrissey> graft, dont know exacly what you mean now ..
[08:27] <linuxvampire> not yet
[08:27] <Morrissey> graft, the interface is great
[08:27] <scoates> hello
[08:27] <linuxvampire> then again I just got it through a massive apt-get spree
[08:27] <MarcN> meisam: you need to update and maybe upgrade your system (use apt-get or aptitude or synaptic) because the cache of the repos you use is hosed.
[08:27] <linuxvampire> I'll give it time :)
[08:27] <Klarre> are there any nice way to switch monitors (and resolutions) with just hotkeys in ubuntu?
[08:28] <savvas> synjet: it's possible if you have a slow connection and trying to download flash
[08:28] <linuxvampire> mozilla 2.0 sure crashes a good bit with LinuxMint, and it's damn near identical to edgy :(
[08:28] <fredJones840> oh yea? thats shitty
[08:28] <linuxvampire> the maintainers say "its 98% Ubuntu, and 2% something else"
[08:28] <fredJones840> heh
[08:28] <linuxvampire> (non-free codecs) tee-hee
[08:29] <synjet> savvas: nope, I am on T1.. and it is both with FF and Opera.. after I upgraded to Edgy Eft.. but yes, I saw the prob is with flash.. even after updating flash beta2!
[08:29] <dcordes> how can i run a program from command line to a different xserver?
[08:29] <linuxvampire> that was like the first monkey on my back with ubuntu, back when Hoary was new.
[08:29] <novo> who has kubuntu in a compaq laptop???
[08:29] <linuxvampire> "NO MP3 PLAYBACK HELPS"
[08:29] <linuxvampire> :(
[08:29] <linuxvampire> I got flamed hardcore.
[08:29] <garrett_novo> novo!!! thats my name
[08:30] <graft> Morrissey: it's great, definitely, but it isn't pretty... i'm not sure what it is i want, but some things about it just seem kind of clunky
[08:30] <novo> ups, it is not the same
[08:30] <scoates> I can't seem to get my swap to turn on at boot. I've tried both: "UUID=42edaa17-b0cb-4220-ad06-0c3c47599ffe swap sw 0 0" and "/dev/hda5 swap sw 0 0" in /etc/fstab, and nothing in /proc/swaps ; however, if I "sudo swapon -U 42edaa17-b0cb-4220-ad06-0c3c47599ffe" the swap shows up. Help?
[08:30] <MarcN> dcordes: ssh -XC your@overthere some-x-command
[08:30] <linuxvampire> if there was a needed Ubunt-ism, it's E-buntu

[08:31] <graft> Morrissey: like the frequent use of standard KDE list interfaces is irksome... just not appealing
[08:31] <elknof1_> hi everybody
[08:31] <novo> I'll watch real madrid on tv
[08:31] <craigbass1976> So, I jsut booted to teh ubuntu cd, and had the exact same trouble with wvdial as I do in Fedora.
[08:31] <elknof1_> just a question... is it possible to lock the volume level of the master channel with the headphones channel??
[08:31] <fredJones840> nice quit msg sissy .. heheh
[08:32] <fredJones840> Bush hid the facts
=== darkmatter is now known as Steve_Ballmer
[08:32] <graft> elknof1_: why?
=== kosh_ is now known as djkosh
[08:33] <elknof1_> graft: cause' i'd like to control the headphones level with the volume keys on my laptop
[08:34] <globe> elknof1_: I'd like to know the same thing.  good luck
[08:34] <graft> elknof1_: why not just peg one and adjust the other?
[08:34] <dcordes> MarcN: you got that wrong. i don't want to open it on a remote box but on my own one. just in a different display
=== Steve_Ballmer is now known as darkmatter
[08:34] <globe> graft: the controls adjust the 'master' volume...it does nothing to the output though
[08:34] <sizzam> is there a command to find how much disk space a particular folder is using?
[08:35] <rioghal> globe, can you shoot the headphone volume all the way up and just manipulate the master volume?
[08:35] <synjet> dcordes: you want to run a prog on a remote m/c and get the display here?
[08:35] <elknof1_> rioghal: yes
[08:35] <graft> globe: um... so, my laptop has an additional 'hardware' volume, separate from the software 'master' volume, is this what you mean?
[08:35] <BaTTo\> question -> Can i watch anime, movies and stuff in ubuntu?
[08:36] <graft> BaTTo\: hells yes
[08:36] <globe> rioghal: no, the master vol can be muted and sound still comes out of the speakers...
[08:36] <globe> graft: nope
[08:36] <rioghal> globe, oj
[08:36] <rioghal> *oh
[08:36] <graft> globe: um, what laptop?
[08:36] <dcordes> synjet: no remote box at all. the point is i have no mouse and want to run things in my xsession
[08:36] <elknof1_> dell inspiron 600m
[08:36] <graft> globe: so your volume keys expect some software layer to do the work...
[08:36] <dcordes> synjet: and i can't get to a terminal
[08:36] <globe> graft: not laptop actually, its a desktop
[08:36] <BaTTo\> graft: ok ok thx
[08:37] <froo> hmm... my firefox does not update the pages anymore?!
[08:37] <graft> BaTTo\: movie playback is one thing where Linux probably kicks the crap out of windoze/macs
[08:37] <froo> mouse gestures don't work in some tabs aswell
[08:37] <BaTTo\> i also need need some help with a modem driver. cuz i had ubuntu 2 hours ago but since i couldnt connect i had to turn back to windwos :'(
[08:37] <linuxvampire> well umm
[08:37] <graft> globe: s/laptop/desktop/, same question
[08:37] <graveson> where do i find out about supported hardware. is core 2 duo supported,because i cannot install dapper
[08:37] <linuxvampire> I'm not going anywehre for a while.
[08:38] <linuxvampire> decided to give automatix a shot, and saw too much stuff I liked :P
[08:38] <savvas> BaTTo\: you
[08:38] <globe> graft: heh.  its a gateway e4000
[08:38] <hentai> why doesn't ncmpc change the volume when i press the right/left arrows? it changes the value in the corner, but the volume stays the same.
[08:38] <savvas> BaTTo\: you'd save a lot of problems if you use router/dsl modems
[08:38] <linuxvampire> even on (borrowed) DSL this is gonna take a whiel.. :|
[08:38] <linuxvampire> BaTTo\: stuck out in the stick like I am?
[08:38] <linuxvampire> *sticks
[08:39] <BaTTo\> savvas: em my modem is conexant 14:??: 10-generic ( i used to know)
[08:39] <fredJones840> thas me .. but at least i have wifi
[08:39] <linuxvampire> heh
[08:39] <BaTTo\> savvas:and linuxant only lets me get 14.4 kbps
[08:39] <linuxvampire> you aint far enough into the sticks then :(
[08:39] <graft> globe: urm. every try 'hotkeys' daemon or some such?
[08:39] <rioghal> lol
[08:39] <fredJones840> haha o no .. i am in the middle of nowhere ..
[08:39] <linuxvampire> my buddy came over with his laptop and said YOU GOT WIFI OUT HERE?  I said "HAHAHAHAHA ARE YOU KIDDDDDDDING?"
[08:39] <fredJones840> haha
[08:40] <sally_> I have mysql-java installed but apt-file  list mysql-java returns nothing, and I just did an apt-file update
[08:40] <linuxvampire> you must give me the name of your wireless bband card :P
[08:40] <FirstStrike> Broadcast your dial up via wifi
[08:40] <rioghal> linuxvampire, are you so far out that they have to pipe in the sunlight?
[08:40] <FirstStrike> >:P
[08:40] <linuxvampire> your LINUX compatible!!!
[08:40] <linuxvampire> rioghal: you got it.
[08:40] <linuxvampire> they ship it in from Maine daily along with my lobster..
[08:40] <fredJones840> nice
[08:40] <rioghal> haha
[08:40] <BaTTo\> help with modem plz :(
[08:40] <linuxvampire> because um, all vampires are rich flamboyant sissies.
[08:40] <livingdaylig> linuxvampire: yoiu are a vampire?
[08:40] <fredJones840> hehe
[08:41] <globe> graft: yea,  I just have a 104-key kbd, with f5,f6,f7 setup for volume control (simmilar ot mac).  They adjust/mute volume control, but only the "master" volume (which does nothing)
[08:41] <linuxvampire> too many RPGs, now I'm roleplaying iRC :(
[08:41] <fredJones840> haha
[08:41] <linuxvampire> that better be oak, or else yer in TRUBBULL!

[08:42] <linuxvampire> oh boy I'm lagging.
[08:42] <globe> graft: nothing that I notice...
[08:42] <linuxvampire> *looks around* Im not at HOME! *gasp*
[08:42] <fre4k> i upgraded to edgy but my firefox is still 1.5 :(
[08:42] <dcordes> how can i run a console in my gnome desktop without no keyboard?
[08:42] <prova> I can't find the firefox link in ubuntu: where is it?
[08:42] <graft> globe: so how do you know it's doing anything?
[08:42] <fredJones840> alright .. ive gotta figure out what the hells goin on here ..
[08:42] <linuxvampire> fre4k: GOOD, 2.0 crashes a lot in edgy,,, for me.
[08:42] <graft> dcordes: telepathy
[08:42] <graveson> where do i find out about supported hardware. is core 2 duo supported,because i cannot install dapper
[08:42] <globe> graft: it adjusts something, it shows pretty icons and slider bars and such, but the output does not change
[08:43] <linuxvampire> LinuxMint=close enough..
[08:43] <prova> I can't find the firefox link in ubuntu: where is it?
[08:43] <fre4k> linuxvampire: are u using the mozilla build or the ubuntu build ?
[08:43] <graft> globe: um, is the pretty icons at the OS level or some BIOS thing?
[08:43] <globe> prova: type 'firefox &'
[08:43] <Potatoking> hey there! I'm getting crazy with my w-lan on edgy... I'm using the bcm43xx-cutter and the gnome-network-manager. in the nm-applet my network is displayed but when I try to connect, it failes... does anyone have a hint?
[08:43] <globe> graft: os.
[08:43] <prova> I've just ubuntu vers. 5.10
[08:43] <linuxvampire> fre4k: whatever came stock, I'll check after automatix gets done wasting other peoples' bandwidth.
[08:43] <ashzilla> linuxvampire: just running /server <newserveraddress> disconnected me from this server and reconnected to the server I entered.
[08:43] <dcordes> xmms
[08:43] <globe> graft: its from gnome
[08:43] <prova> ok globe, I'll try.
[08:43] <metres> novo: fglrxinfo ?!
[08:43] <linuxvampire> Potatoking: my buddy has that card too, we smoked a LOT of cigarettes whilst dealing with it :(
[08:44] <ashzilla> lol
[08:44] <graft> globe: um, hrm. it's messing with ESD levels or something?
[08:44] <pango_> ciao
[08:44] <dfgas> dfgas@p42400-cool:~$ umount /network/music

[08:44] <fre4k> okay
[08:44] <jimmy-james> anyone know how to install vim plugins on edgy? i do not have a .vim folder in my home dir, do i need to create one?
[08:44] <dfgas> how do i fix that?
[08:44] <linuxvampire> then went to the garage, smoked (something) and played Tank Wars instead.
[08:44] <pango_> hei, c' nessuno in italiano

[08:45] <globe> graft: got me.  I just gave up on the kbd thing and switched to xfce -- it has an applet that lets you choose which volume level it adjusts.  But that leaves me w/o kbd control
[08:45] <pango_> yeah
[08:45] <Potatoking> linuxvampire: oh I don't smoke... and I don't wanna start... did you found a solution?
[08:45] <linuxvampire> xfce is kool, but E17 is quite coolt oo. :D
[08:45] <prova> 'firefox &' return an error.
[08:45] <pango_> excuse me!
[08:45] <pango_> bye!
[08:45] <globe> prova: do you have it installed?
[08:45] <linuxvampire> Potatoking: that's the problem... I suggested we try ndiswrapper and he didn't wanna mess with it.
[08:45] <linuxvampire> so we gave up :\
[08:46] <linuxvampire> he's got a hard-wired connection to the router anyway, so he doesn't mind it much.
[08:46] <graft> globe: well, i don't use gnome, so i can't help too much, but... you can run alsamixer while you're adjusting levels and see if it fiddles with those levels directly, that'll show you what channel it's changing
[08:46] <lewix> hi
[08:46] <Potatoking> I tried ndiswrapper too... but that didn't worked at all
[08:46] <prova> synaptic says yes
[08:46] <linuxvampire> moved his comp into another room in the floor.
[08:47] <globe> graft: hmm...it is adjusting the "Master M" channel
[08:47] <linuxvampire> uh oh
[08:47] <linuxvampire> I have 14mb free on my system partition
[08:47] <fre4k> has anyone tried xgl on edgy
[08:47] <linuxvampire> this aint good.
[08:47] <graft> globe: that's totally useless, master mono channel
[08:47] <graft> globe: you want it to adjust the 'master' channel...

[08:47] <Jinkguns> Is there a easy way to figure out what kind of file system is on a disk?
[08:47] <graft> globe: any idea wht the applet is?
[08:47] <globe> graft: its gnome that is adjusting the wrong channel if you ask me...
[08:47] <linuxvampire> just forced automatix to take a break :(
[08:48] <Jinkguns> A filesystem that Ubuntu can't read at the moment.
[08:48] <lewix> I want to resize my partitions, I have 40gb for win and 40 for ubuntu. However, I want to resize it, and I can't find qtparted on ubuntu.  How can I install it step by step as a newbie I am. My other question is how to uninstall ubuntu once I partitioned my hd and install it again
[08:48] <linuxvampire> lewix: try cfdisk
[08:48] <linuxvampire> its for the brave.
[08:48] <lewix> linuxvampire, I'm a newbie

[08:54] <cafe_> greetings, I am converting a Inet cafe in Fullerton, Ca USA over to ubuntu, from fedora, the good news is everything works with the 2.4 kernel, however when I try to load edgy sound breaks (SI7012 w intel8x0) perhaps you can help me get this to work w/edgy so we have the latest , or it is it more advisable to use dapper w/the 2.4 kernel??? Any Solutions??
[08:55] <mikeo1f> how do i backup my ubuntu dapper install to dvd
[08:55] <sobpanic> kitche: it's a Biostar NF325-A7 nForce3 754 socket, with IDE yep
[08:55] <mikeo1f> want to do a backup of system files before i upgrade to edgy
[08:55] <graft> cafe_: why a 2.4 kernel? welcome to the 21st century, man...
[08:55] <globe> sobpanic: what is IDE?
[08:55] <kitche> sobpanic: hmm it should be supported you might have to do something with the nforce but by default it should work
[08:56] <LjL> globe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Attachment
[08:56] <cafe_> graft - why use a 2.6 kernel that doesn't load the sound drivers proplerly- when 2.4 works
[08:56] <kitche> graft: 2.4 kernel people still use since it's "stable"
[08:56] <tim167> is there a way to convert.mp4 into .wav ? thanks
[08:56] <rickyfingers> cafe_: the word around this channel is that edgy is a development release, not as stable as dapper
[08:56] <SpriteSODA> guys someone free to help?
[08:57] <graft> cafe_: oh, you mean edgy 2.6 kernel breaks
[08:57] <carlosqueso> cafe_ have you tried to compile the drivers directly in the kernel
[08:57] <carlosqueso> ?
[08:57] <carlosqueso> I had to for my soundcard
[08:57] <cafe_> yes I re-compiled alsa - without any luck
[08:57] <sobpanic> globe: the IDE is just regular ATA i think, if that what you mean
[08:57] <rickyfingers> SpriteSODA: just go ahead and ask, no need for pleasantries
[08:57] <SpriteSODA> how can i change the theme of the system from the terminal?
[08:57] <carlosqueso> but as a module, or directly in
[08:57] <SpriteSODA> it created a huge error with beryl
[08:57] <graft> cafe_: how's it breaking?
[08:57] <kitche> actually edgy is pretty stable if you do a complete reinstall an upgrade always breaks a system really
[08:57] <SpriteSODA> and shot me out of the system
[08:57] <globe> LjL, sobpanic: lol.  IDE.  right.  hard drive.  I was thinking development environment on the mobo.
[08:58] <rickyfingers> SpriteSODA: I don't use beryl
[08:58] <LjL> mouarf
[08:58] <sobpanic> kitche, thanks, the reason i'm asking is because Ubuntu is is hanging when i try to install it
[08:58] <globe> SpriteSODA: you can kill beryl from the term: killall beryl
[08:58] <sobpanic> oh, hehe
[08:58] <SpriteSODA> mmm
[08:58] <stoft> I just switched from KDE to Gnome, any suggestions for a mediaplayer with same/similar functionality to Amarok?
[08:58] <SpriteSODA> what does it do exactly? will it prevent it from loading at boot?
[08:58] <globe> but then you will have to start metacity manually
[08:58] <sobpanic> i wouldn't know
[08:58] <kitche> stoft: banshee
[08:58] <graft> why would you switch from KDE to Gnome?
[08:58] <LjL> !players | stoft
[08:58] <ubotu> stoft: Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[08:58] <globe> SpriteSODA: no, just terminates the session for now
[08:59] <SpriteSODA> the problem is that i get stuck after i fill in username and password
[08:59] <stoft> thnx LjL, kitche
[08:59] <cafe_> graft: sound fails to work in edgy, it works in breezy & dapper, --- rickyfingers: thanks for the word of faith in dapper - sounds like I should stick with the working and forget running beryl for now
[08:59] <SpriteSODA> during the loading with the music
[08:59] <kitche> stoft: banshee is as close as amarok for
[08:59] <kitche> grr hit the enter button gnome
[08:59] <globe> SpriteSODA: mmm.  try changing your session to some other windows manager
[08:59] <stoft> graft: sorry, I don't have an answer for your question.
[09:00] <graft> cafe_: i mean, how does it fail to work? do modules not load, etc.? or what?
=== ubuntu4alexej is now known as AV1611
[09:00] <SpriteSODA> which file is the boot file of the OS? maybe i can disable beryl from there
[09:00] <joachim-n> how do I get debug packages?
[09:00] <rickyfingers> cafe_: I for one and perfectly happy with the default gui provided with Ubuntu. Gnome works great, not so complex, winds up saving me time
[09:01] <graveson> does edgy support core2 duo and if so where can i find the torrent file ?
[09:01] <rickyfingers> cafe_: I don't know anything about beryl, but for now Gnome works fine
[09:01] <stoft> graft: I switched with 6.10, because I thought KDE was buggy (it turned out to be something else) and now I've kind of stayed in Gnome. Gonna give it a try. Maybe I'll go back to KDE, maybe not.
[09:01] <cafe_> It loads the modules - it just won't address the hardware - works in fedora 6 running 2.6, of course that is red hat and we are talking debain - 2 different planets
[09:02] <dnite> is there a way to search though your installed packages to find any orphaned dependencies automatically?
[09:02] <stoft> dnite:  try "orphan"
[09:02] <stoft> dnite: I think it will do the job
[09:02] <graft> cafe_: and i'm assuming alsa is configured correctly, etc.
[09:02] <carlosqueso> !deborphan | dnite
[09:02] <ubotu> dnite: deborphan is a program used to clean up packages that are no longer needed (install from Synaptic/Adept).
[09:02] <sobpanic> so here's what happens when i try to boot of the CD: the main Ubuntu menu loads and i choose "Start or Install Ubuntu," the Linux Kernel loads, the Ubuntu logo shows up and the slidebar runs for a while, then i just get dropped to a screen with a blinking cursor and it stalls there... anyone know what might be causing that?
[09:02] <stoft> doh, wrong name... :)
[09:03] <dnite> stoft, cool. thanks. x=)
[09:03] <cafe_> seems so, - aplay -l shows the hardware properly
[09:03] <bimberi> graveson: torrent files here http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/  i know that it supports dual-core PCs
[09:03] <graft> isn't there an apt-get way to do that? apt-get autoremove or some such?
[09:04] <carlosqueso> cafe_ are alsa and your sound drivers compiled as modules?
[09:04] <Xorlev> Anyone here have problems with Software RAID after going to Edgy? More specifically, it freezes after running /script/local-top and then goes a little farther, registered usbhid, then stops booting. The hdd activity light pulses steadily, but I'll come back half an hour later and it'll still be doing that
[09:04] <vaw> hello
[09:04] <stoft> dnite: there was an article about orphan packages at debian-administration not long ago, take a peek there.
[09:04] <pipipi> hi, does Ubuntu have a sound manager similar to the one in Windows?
[09:04] <vaw> I wanted to know if Ubuntu-desktop works as a livecd and if it comes with an usable gcc
[09:05] <pipipi> which controls volume settings for your sound card, for both line out and line in
[09:05] <tim167> hi all, I'm looking for a way to convert 100 .mp4 files into .wav files with a script or something...any ideas ? (playing them and recording them in another app is going to take too long...)
[09:05] <LjL> graft, dnite: yes, if you're on Edgy apt-get autoremove will do the trick. on Dapper, you can use aptitude (but you have to use it when installing packages as well, for the automatic removal to work), or things like deborphan and debfoster (not quite automatic)
[09:05] <cafe_> carlosqueso: at first they were - then I compiled them into the kernel
[09:05] <tim167> pipipi: alsamixer
[09:05] <cafe_> still no dice
[09:05] <carlosqueso> strange....does oss work?
[09:05] <pipipi> thanks
[09:05] <carlosqueso> vaw...yes and yes
[09:05] <vaw> carlosqueso, thankyou
[09:05] <carlosqueso> np
[09:05] <rickyfingers> Xorlev: was just recompiling my kernel, and I noticed this line in menu.lst: # WARNING: If you are using dmraid do not change this entry to 'saved' or your
[09:05] <rickyfingers> # array will desync and will not let you boot your system.
[09:05] <rickyfingers> default
[09:06] <cafe_> oss tries to use different hardware that doesn't corrospond to the hardware in the computer (RealTek chipset)
[09:06] <kitche> cafe_: I m gonna ask you somethign by chance did you compielt he modem sound also? into the kernel since that's what I have to do for intel AC97 sound card
[09:06] <carlosqueso> weird...
[09:06] <Xorlev> rickyfingers: Hmm, lemmie take a look.
[09:06] <lakin> I'm trying to change the default paper size of tetex using "sudo texconfig" but it's not working, I regenerate the pdf and it's still using a4.  The latex is setup to be letter and I need it to be letter .. any ideas?
[09:06] <cafe_> kitche - there is no modem in the machine
[09:06] <graft> cafe_: is it just a mixer issue?
[09:07] <kitche> cafe_: doesn't amtter it still needs modem sound for some reason I took my modem out of my computer but still need the modem sound for it to work
[09:07] <rioghal> lakin, why would you need sudo for that? doesn't that just change the paper size for the root user?
[09:07] <lakin> rioghal: aaah, good call, I don't know but I'll try your suggestion
[09:07] <rioghal> kitche, is it a sound/modem combo?
[09:07] <rioghal> lakin, :)
[09:08] <cafe_> hmmm - I have looked this up on ubuntuforums and nobody had figured it out, I suppose I will try to comple the modem into the kernel
[09:08] <rioghal> lakin, yeah, sounds like a 'per-user' thing
[09:08] <lakin> rioghal: I just ran it as my user, selected letter and re-generated my document, but the resulting pdf is still a4
[09:08] <kitche> rioghal: no my AC97 needs the AC97 modem soudn enabled int he kernel to have my sound work found that out just a few days ago
[09:09] <rioghal> kitche, that sucks
[09:09] <lakin> rioghal: nevermind, I think I might have found it ... thanks
[09:09] <rioghal> lakin, well, it was a thought
[09:09] <amrnet> evolution do not seem to use arabic character encoding. is there a way to overcome or configure that
[09:09] <javiolo> is truth that ubuntu will stop making a ppc version ?
[09:09] <linuxvampire_> *gasp*
[09:10] <lakin> rioghal, strangely enough when running it as sudo, it did set it up in my home directory (for my usual user) ... but permissions were wrong
[09:10] <lakin> rioghal: thank you!  now I can print my thesis by the due date.
[09:10] <rioghal> lakin, is it a gui app?
[09:10] <lakin> rioghal: no
[09:11] <rioghal> lakin, youre welcome, glad you got it sorted
[09:11] <Xorlev> rickyfingers: That wasn't it, I have a default of 0 and not saved. Either way, I'm using mdadm
[09:11] <linuxvampire_> is there a meta package for all the gnome wm stuff, but doesnt mess up gtk apps?
[09:11] <mikeo1f> how do i backup my ubuntu dapper install to dvd
[09:11] <rioghal> mikeo1f, you might be interested in partimage
[09:11] <blue-frog> I have 87 keys on my french vaio keyboard, any idea of what kind of keyboard I must use in system/pref/keyboard?
[09:12] <rioghal> !partimage > mikeo1f
[09:12] <rickyfingers> Xorlev: sorry, I'm getting in over my head talking about raid any how, I just remembered that from menu.lst (did I call it grub.conf?) because I had just read it.
[09:12] <mikeo1f> is there a way to only back up system files though?
[09:12] <mikeo1f> like system restore in windows
[09:12] <Xorlev> rickyfingers: Thanks for that though :)
[09:12] <rioghal> mikeo1f, partimage will backup the enitre partition
[09:12] <mikeo1f> i know... i dont have space for the entire partition
[09:12] <kitche> mike01f: partimage is what you want it backups all of your data
[09:13] <kitche> mikeo1f: like my partition is 36 gigs but it onyl backuped up 3.16 and made it fit on a cd
[09:13] <rioghal> mikeo1f, you might also want to open a term and type: apt-cache search backup
[09:13] <Eclipse75> hello world
[09:13] <mikeo1f> how much was used?
[09:13] <synjet> Eclipse75: Hello Alien! :)
[09:13] <mikeo1f> /dev/sda1            288370908 241475892  32246552  89% /
[09:13] <rickyfingers> mikeolf: another idea is to use dd in combination with bzcat to create a compressed image
[09:13] <Eclipse75> hehe
[09:13] <DonLemmi> hi, does 6.10 no longer have an inittab?
[09:14] <mikeo1f> lol i dont think it will be possible to backup 200 gigs
[09:14] <rioghal> mikeo1f, kitche partimage only backsup the *used* bit of a partition and you can compress the backup to make it really small.
[09:14] <mikeo1f> on a dvd
[09:14] <mikeo1f> 200 gigs is used
[09:14] <furio_> I just set up an ubuntu server, I plan to run ruby on rails on it... it looks like the default ruby package doesn't include ruby gems, is there another package that does?
[09:14] <rioghal> mikeo1f, it will if you have only used 2 gigs of that 200 gig drive
[09:14] <kitche> rioghal: yes isn't that what I said :)
[09:14] <mikeo1f> lol actually 241gigs is used
[09:14] <nativow> Hi! Which apt should I get to help me config my wireless network????
[09:14] <rioghal> kitche, oh, yeah, my bad
[09:14] <mikeo1f> i just want to back up system files and programs
[09:15] <mikeo1f> beacuse the edgy upgrade wont mess with that stuff
[09:15] <rioghal> mikeo1f, maybe use the tar command to backup some directories?
[09:15] <synjet> nativow: your wireless doesnt work using the network-manager?
[09:15] <rickyfingers> nativow: as far as I know everything is already included in ubuntu, accept ndiswrapper, you made need that one
[09:16] <rickyfingers> !ndiswrapper
[09:16] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:16] <chrisbittner> what application can play .mp3 files???
[09:16] <Eclipse75> amarok
[09:16] <Eclipse75> xmms
[09:16] <rickyfingers> nativow: check out that link from ubotu
[09:16] <kitche> !mp3|chrisbittner:

[09:16] <Eclipse75> and use vlc for any videos :)
[09:16] <rioghal> mikeo1f, well, if you back up your dapper system files and install edgy and edgy messes things up, you can't restore the dapper system files and expect edgy to work if the dapper stuff isnt compatiable
[09:16] <Eclipse75> while also installed the wmv codec :)
=== sobpanic is now known as Bueller
[09:17] <Bueller> anyone?
[09:17] <rickyfingers> Eclipse75: is vlc what people are going to in stead of mplayer - I notice mplayer's last release was a long tme ago
[09:17] <hangfire> anyone what?
[09:17] <Bueller> so here's what happens when i try to boot of the CD: the main Ubuntu menu loads and i choose "Start or Install Ubuntu," the Linux Kernel loads, the Ubuntu logo shows up and the slidebar runs for a while, then i just get dropped to a screen with a blinking cursor and it stalls there... anyone know what might be causing that?
[09:17] <rogue780> vlc is the best for any video
[09:17] <nativow> synjet, i`m looking for 'network-manager' but i cant find it in Synaptic
[09:18] <Eclipse75> eh i guess rickyfingers. vlc plays pretty well everything excluding quicktime
[09:18] <trench-> vlc is kinda like the swiss army knife of vid players
[09:18] <rogue780> rickyfingers, MPlayer just released a nice update a few weeks ago
[09:18] <rogue780> afk
[09:18] <Eclipse75> maybe real player also?
[09:18] <synjet> nativow: sudo apt-get install gnome-network-manager
[09:18] <Eclipse75> er real media files
[09:18] <synjet> nativow: but it is part of ubuntu
[09:18] <carlosqueso> Bueller: are you trying to install?
[09:18] <synjet> nativow: what youmight need is ndiswrapper or ipw2200
[09:18] <Eclipse75> mplayer codecs + vlc = good
[09:18] <fredJones840> ive got a copy of ubuntu thats been doing the same thing to me .. except it freezes in the second installation step
[09:18] <rickyfingers> Eclipse75, rogue780: I just compiled mplayer today, as usual, plays just about anything I can throw at it.
[09:19] <Bueller> carlosqueso: yes, trying to install version 6.10
[09:19] <carlosqueso> have either of you tried the alternate CD?
[09:19] <Eclipse75> yeah mplayer is nice
[09:19] <rogue780> rickyfingers, except for tivo videos. nobody has made a tivo codec for linux yet
[09:19] <Eclipse75> can you play videos from the terminal with mplayer?
[09:19] <hangfire> Bueller-did you choose clean format when you install?
[09:19] <avenger__> sup?
[09:19] <fredJones840> i didnt wipe the harddrive first tho .. so im going to go do that and see if it works better
[09:20] <GhostFreeman> How can I see what version of AIGLX i am running
[09:20] <synjet> Eclipse75: you can also play videos in terminal with mplayer in ASCII format :)
[09:20] <avenger__> tell me
[09:20] <rickyfingers> Eclipse75: yeah, it's too easy, it's just mplayer video-file-name
[09:20] <GhostFreeman> or what version Radeon drivers I am running
[09:20] <graft> Eclipse75: you mean within X, or from the console?
[09:20] <archangelpetro> does anyone use eclipse to code java here? cuz im having issues with getting java5 to work with it.. synaptic believes, for some reason, that i need gcj-4.1 to run eclipse?
[09:20] <bhudda> Anyone know why my screen turns off while I am watching a movie in VLC fullscreen?
[09:20] <fredJones840> no i use java sun studio
[09:20] <Bueller> hangfire: i don't think i even get to that option -- i can't get much past the main Ubuntu boot menu and a loading progress bar -- then it stalls
[09:20] <trench-> screensaver kicking in? powersave feature perhaps?
[09:21] <kitche> !java|archangelpetro
[09:21] <ubotu> archangelpetro: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[09:21] <fredJones840> the studio enterprise 8 .. fn sweet ass prog
[09:21] <Bueller> could it be a hardware problem?
[09:21] <dreamer> anybody with exp. in usb-optical-moues in dapper ?
[09:21] <javiolo> !ppc
[09:21] <ubotu> ppc is PowerPC.  Formerly used by Apple for the Macintosh line of computers, and now a fully supported Ubuntu architecture.
[09:21] <synjet> Bueller: might be a bad image.. try writing another CD
[09:21] <kitche> archangelpetro: you have to do the update-alternatives command also
[09:21] <hangfire> Bueller- well then thats the problem, you do have that option. Ubuntu install is so easy it is easy to overlook simple options
[09:21] <rickyfingers> Eclipse75, graft: yeah, I'm assuming you mean in an X environment. then you hack you're buddies machine, put a cron job that calls mplayer to play an interesting video, and wait for him to figure out what's happening.
[09:21] <bhudda> i dunno i looked in the preferences but there wasn't anything. I also turned off my screensaver
[09:21] <rogue780> afk
[09:21] <archangelpetro> kitche, i have.. but it doesnt change it :/
[09:21] <archangelpetro> kitche, it wont allow me to change the jre for some reason
[09:21] <Bueller> synjet: i tried that, no dice
[09:22] <Bueller> hangfire: i would feel stupid, but lemme double check
[09:22] <graft> holy SHIT, this aalib stuff is cool!
[09:22] <pluma> archangelpetro, try installing the Sun JDK manually and then using update-alternatives to fix the binaries associations
[09:23] <graft> Eclipse75: you can also play stuff from a console if you have a framebuffer set up
[09:24] <pluma> archangelpetro, also, I'd suggest installing Eclipse manually. I don't know whether the repo version is finally somewhat up to date. It was still at 3.1 last I checked.
[09:24] <bighil> hi, edgy install always locks my system completly down in the same place: 87% setting clock. The hardware is new Asus P5B with Core duos. Anyone have an idea?
[09:24] <rickyfingers> bighil: is your bios up to date?
[09:25] <bighil> hmm that could be, havent looked
[09:25] <archangelpetro> pluma, aye i think you are right..
=== mako_ is now known as mako
[09:25] <Bueller> hangfire: my only options are -- "Start or Install Ubuntu (or in safe graphics mode)," Check CD for defects, Memory Test, Boot from First Hard Drive, and then Help, Language, Keymap, VGA, and Accessability
[09:25] <rickyfingers> bighil: there's another quick and dirty thing you could do, and you might break a lot of stuff, but if that's coming from scripts in /etc/rc.whatever
[09:25] <ploom> bighil, setting clock or synchronizing clock (latter one  can be cancelled with ctrl+c)?
[09:26] <IndyGUnFreak> have you tried downloading the alternate install cd?
[09:26] <rickyfingers> bighil: you could just comment stuff about setting clock
[09:26] <hangfire> Bueller, after you choose start or install Ubuntu you will have the option to format
[09:26] <carlosqueso> !alternate cd
[09:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alternate cd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:26] <pluma> archangelpetro, I went with the binaries from Sun and Eclipse and after tweaking update-alternatives Eclipse worked like a charm.
[09:27] <bieb_work> I have a useradd question... if I type useradd -D there are settings for group, home, inactive, expire, etc... if I type useradd joe, it just creates the user, no home dir .. am I missing something?
[09:27] <bighil> the alternate install cd would be my next try, thanks for the answers
[09:27] <Bueller> hangfire: what I've been saying is that its after I go to Start or Install that I get stalled at a blinking cursor
[09:27] <Zambezi> If the mouse is work, but every other application freezed, is it the WM fault then? The application I used during the freeze was gftp (GTK).
[09:27] <IndyGUnFreak> good luck.
[09:27] <archangelpetro> pluma, i assume that if i install the binaries from sun (im on amd64 btw)... that when i look at update-alternatives... it'll show the install path and give me the choice?
[09:27] <Eclipse75> adduser
[09:27] <Eclipse75> adduser eclipse75
[09:27] <hangfire> Bueller- oh, dont know then
[09:27] <pluma> archangelpetro, nah. You need to add the paths via update-alternatives yourself.
[09:28] <bieb_work> Eclipse.. I mean on my ubuntu box..
[09:28] <synjet> bieb_work: tried using the GUI? System-->Admin-->Users?
[09:28] <bieb_work> not here
[09:28] <trench-> i want to install kubuntu on my em64t workstation...but the 64 bit 6.10 install can't load the gui, like it can't load my vidcard, which is a 7900GTX...i'm new to kubuntu, so i wouldn't know how to install from terminal...any ideas, anyone?
[09:28] <Bueller> hangfire: yah, me neither :)
[09:28] <bieb_work> syn.. I wanted to learn the CLI way also
[09:28] <pluma> archangelpetro, basically, just let the binary unpack everything and then put that directory in /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_whathaveyou or wherever you want and set up the alternatives.
[09:29] <IndyGUnFreak> my system will run the 64bit installations, but I've never had luck with them.
[09:29] <archangelpetro> pluma well it's weird eclipse when i download it from the repos... it doesnt find the java5 VM :/ never had that issue before... i dont know how to manually set up alternatives either
[09:29] <IndyGUnFreak> try the i386 version..
[09:29] <pluma> archangelpetro, I did that and then symlinked the most recent Sun JDK to /usr/java/jdk so I only need to update one alternative when I want to switch between JDK versions
[09:30] <trench-> so just try i386 then?
[09:30] <trench-> i'll give that a try...thanks
[09:30] <IndyGUnFreak> thats what i would do trench
[09:30] <pluma> archangelpetro, try "man update-alternatives" from the console. Pretty self-explanatory. You need to add paths for every important binary (java, javac, etc) tho
[09:30] <LadyNikon> hmm
[09:30] <IndyGUnFreak> the 64bit has always gave me probs.
[09:30] <trench-> i see
[09:31] <ph8> if i know something is recognised - how can i find it's device pointer and mount it? -> it wasn't recognised as portable storage, just a 'dell device' - it's a dell pda
[09:31] <IndyGUnFreak> but i use an ATI video card, so i expect probs..lol
[09:31] <trench-> hehehe...
[09:31] <rickyfingers> IndyGUnFreak: I had problems with almost every 64 bit distro until I updated my bios
[09:31] <archangelpetro> pluma i'll do that.. it's still kinad weird though that the JRE isnt detected after install.
[09:31] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm, my bios is up to date, but 64bit, always freezes, locks up during install, etc.
[09:31] <trench-> my bios is up to date...running gentoo on it atm...got kubuntu on my laptop
[09:31] <IndyGUnFreak> just never works for me.
[09:32] <IndyGUnFreak> i've never had an issue with any 32bit version of ubuntu..
=== quiet is now known as Ms_cleo
[09:32] <trench-> i just want to try kubuntu on my faster machine...downloading i386 now
[09:32] <qatsi> uhmmm..im having troubles with ndiswrapper...when i have to do sudo modprobe ndiswrapper, i get this error: FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid argument...anyone knows why ?? thank you :)
[09:32] <pluma> archangelpetro, I don't know whether the repo Eclipse is any different, but are you sure the JDK is in its search path when you search for installed JDKs?
[09:32] <rickyfingers> Here's a n00b question: what if you do a 32 bit install of ubuntu, then compile a 64 bit kernel
[09:32] <IndyGUnFreak> I dont' like Kub, but it works fine for m.e
[09:32] <rickyfingers> will that boot?
[09:32] <linuxvampire_> heh
[09:32] <trench-> lol
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> is gentoo any good if you're on dialup?
[09:33] <IndyGUnFreak> i have no idea ricky..lol
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> I downloaded an iso earlier
[09:33] <IndyGUnFreak> nothing is good if you're on dial up.. :)
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> like as far as coming with all the crap you need to compile a modem drvier?
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> headers, blah, etc?
[09:33] <archangelpetro> pluma, well i find the 1.5.0 JRE when i run "update-alternatives .... "  it's just when it's selected eclipse says cant find it? if that's what u meant
[09:33] <trench-> linuxvampire_, in my experience with gentoo, that will depend on the modem being used
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> intel 536
[09:33] <IndyGUnFreak> i've never had any luck getting a modem to work under LInux, except many many moons ago, with Mandrake 9.0
[09:33] <linuxvampire_> in ubuntu requires basic gcc crap
=== Ms_cleo is now known as quiet
[09:34] <linuxvampire_> headers, and restricted modules.. havent tried another distro heh
[09:34] <qatsi> any idea why the error while doing sudo modprone ndiswrapper.......
[09:34] <pluma> archangelpetro, is that the JRE from the repository?
[09:34] <linuxvampire_> oh well
[09:34] <linuxvampire_> i gotta run, you folks have fun :D
[09:34] <trench-> well, it won't be as easy as ubuntu...i tell you that :)
[09:34] <rickyfingers> qatsi: if you're typenig modprone that's the problem, it's modprobe
[09:34] <chrisbittner> how do i get a wmv codec?
[09:34] <IndyGUnFreak> i don't think anything is as easy as Ubuntu.
[09:34] <archangelpetro> pluma, aye it's JRE from multiverse  sun-java5-jre
[09:35] <qatsi> rickyfingers: sorry, typo error, just in IRC :p, im typing modprobe
[09:35] <rickyfingers> qatsi: one more thing, it should be sudo modprobe -i ndiswrapper
[09:35] <qatsi> rickyfingers: the same error :S
[09:35] <rickyfingers> qatsi: no wait, I'm getting confused.
[09:35] <Bueller> oh hmm -- dumb question -- if i have an AMD Athlon 64 does that mean i need the alternate 64 bit install of Ubuntu?
[09:35] <globe> is it possible to use kde's kooldock in xfce/gnome?  cairo-dock is a pain and kiba is a resource hog
[09:35] <James_T_Kirk> hello
[09:36] <R9KMC> same problem
[09:36] <qatsi> rickyfingers: yes, the -i is in ndiswrapper for installing :p
[09:36] <R9KMC> hi
[09:36] <IndyGUnFreak> it doesn't "need" it bueller..,
[09:36] <rickyfingers> qatsi: first, do sudo nidswrapper -i <driver-file-name>
[09:36] <kuja> Bueller: Would be ideal
[09:36] <R9KMC> Grub: ERROR 18
[09:36] <Some_Person> I have a big problem
[09:36] <rickyfingers> qatsi: then yeah, modprobe nidiswrapper
[09:36] <IndyGUnFreak> 64bit has never worked for me.
[09:36] <pluma> archangelpetro, hm... tried downloading a JDK from Sun and unpacking that somewhere? I think Eclipse is looking for a specific directory hierarchy which the repo version might not provide
[09:36] <R9KMC> i tried to do grub-install and everything
[09:36] <James_T_Kirk> man grub...
[09:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i prefer the 32bit apps, but YMMV
[09:36] <R9KMC> no way
[09:36] <Some_Person> Somehow I ended up with a version of libc6 and libc6-dev that conflict
[09:36] <Bueller> kuja: thanks, maybe thats why my install is failing, im using the regular install ISO
[09:36] <rickyfingers> qatsi: so you are using the -i to install?
[09:36] <qatsi> rickyfingers: and then the error shows up
[09:36] <R9KMC> can anyone help me
[09:37] <kuja> Bueller: It should still work.
[09:37] <Lam_> anyone know how to disable hardware IrDA?
[09:37] <Some_Person> They are broken package
[09:37] <IndyGUnFreak> bu4eller, regular install should work no matter what
[09:37] <rickyfingers> qatsi: ndiswrapper doesn't work for every inf
[09:37] <kitche> R9KMC hang on a sec
[09:37] <R9KMC> kitche: ok
[09:37] <James_T_Kirk> i got a problem with network manager
[09:37] <IndyGUnFreak> i'd try the alternate install CD, before tyring 64bit.. it can be a pain in the..
[09:37] <rickyfingers> qatsi: sourceforge has a good list of .inf files that work with current version of ndiswrapper
[09:37] <archangelpetro> pluma, would i not be able to alter it in its config then?
[09:37] <James_T_Kirk> it worked on my WPA2 network
[09:37] <kitche> R9KMC: this is what the error means Error 18: Selected cylinder exceeds max supported by BIOS
[09:37] <Bueller> kuja: it doesn't even get much past the CD boot screen :-/
[09:37] <Some_Person> libc6 is version 2.3.6.ds1-7
[09:37] <James_T_Kirk> but suddenly, it stops at one green point
[09:37] <kuja> Bueller: Could be a bad burn
[09:37] <R9KMC> kitche: how to select?
[09:38] <kuja> Bueller: Try burning it again at a lower rate
[09:38] <qatsi> rickyfingers: uhmm, ill look for em, but the issue isnt in the driver, is in ndiswrapper itself :(
[09:38] <ashika> Can someone help me out with installing PRBoom?
[09:38] <Some_Person> libc6-dev is version 2.3.2.ds1-22sarge4
[09:38] <James_T_Kirk> tooltip says its waiting for network key
[09:38] <kuja> Bueller: Safest would be 2x or 4x write speed
[09:38] <kitche> R9KMC: so I think it has to do with how your hard drive is setup and/or how your BIOS is setup
[09:38] <James_T_Kirk> can someone help me?
[09:38] <rickyfingers> qatsi: ok I don't know why I'm trying to fly blind here.  what is the error message?
[09:38] <Some_Person> how can i replace these with versions from the repos?
[09:38] <IndyGUnFreak> anyone know how to get that 3D desktop(you've probably seen the video on youtube), working
[09:38] <James_T_Kirk> i use edgy
[09:38] <Bueller> kuja: i reburned once, but a different speed might be better, ill try it
[09:38] <pluma> archangelpetro, no idea. I never messed much around with the config files of Eclipse. It worked fine when I manually installed it.
[09:38] <R9KMC> kitche: I will try

[09:38] <qatsi> rickyfingers: hehe, the error is: FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid argument
[09:39] <erUSUL> R9KMC: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB
[09:39] <Some_Person> i need big help
[09:39] <pluma> archangelpetro, only drawback for me is that I now have to run Eclipse as root whenever I want to auto-update it. But that's not much different from the normal updates anyway.
[09:39] <kitche> R9KMC:  This error is returned when a read is attempted at a linear block address beyond the end of the BIOS translated area. This generally happens if your disk is larger than the BIOS can handle (512MB for (E)IDE disks on older machines or larger than 8GB in general).

[09:39] <steveire> Any installation experts about? I want to do a more interactive install from the start. Once when I was installing (Alternate CD) I chose not to install grub, and got to a installation todo list of everything, and had to resume the installation at that point. Can I start the install interactively?
[09:39] <Some_Person> someone replaced my libc6 and libc6-dev with weirdo  versions
[09:39] <Some_Person> libc6 is version 2.3.6.ds1-7
[09:39] <Some_Person> libc6-dev is version 2.3.2.ds1-22sarge4
[09:40] <archangelpetro> pluma, i just cant understand why it's not working... there's no reason it should fail to find the 1.5.0 JRE
[09:40] <MtJB> i bought a linksys wireless pci adapter that i am having trouble getting to work on edgy
[09:40] <rickyfingers> qatsi: give me a second, I think that error means you have a corrupted module, or a module for a different version of a kernel
[09:40] <Some_Person> i need to replace them with versions from the repos
[09:40] <Some_Person> how do i do that?
[09:40] <kitche> Some_Person: yeha it seems like they still have the sarge-dev packages int he repo
[09:40] <rickyfingers> qatsi: I want to check.
[09:40] <MtJB> do i need to install wlan or something, in addition to the driver?
[09:40] <Some_Person> these versions are not in the repos and are causing problems
[09:41] <Some_Person> how do i revert them back to repos versions?
[09:41] <kitche> Some_Person: just install the version that is in the repo but sarge seems to be a debian package
[09:41] <mikeo1f> how do i upgrade to edgy?
[09:41] <qatsi> rickyfingers: it may be posible, because i dont remember if synaptic installed ndiswrapper or if automatix did....if it was automatix, its probable that the module is corrupt....
[09:41] <Tron2> i've just installed unbuntu and the ati drivers for my 9200SE but im still getting loads of screen lag, is there anything i can do to get it running smoothly?
[09:41] <pluma> archangelpetro, did you try tracking down the path of the JRE and then pointing Eclipse directly at it? Maybe it's just not looking in the right place (illogical as that sounds).
[09:41] <mikeo1f> i am running dapper server with kde and gnome installed
[09:41] <kitche> !upgrade|mikeo1f
[09:41] <ubotu> mikeo1f: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[09:41] <Some_Person> i only install packages from websites and the ubuntu repos
[09:41] <redguy> !upgrade > mikeo1f
[09:42] <Some_Person> do i need to download them with my browser?
[09:42] <IndyGUnFreak> i read a post the other day somewhere about someone having a problem after running the ugprade..
[09:42] <archangelpetro> pluma, i'll have a look
[09:42] <IndyGUnFreak> i did a clean install with no probs.
[09:42] <kitche> Some_Person you cna download it thought he repos but that sarge package is for debian which isn't really compatible with ubuntu
[09:42] <pluma> archangelpetro, if all else fails, just enter the JRE info manually. More annoying, but it should do the trick.
[09:42] <R9KMC> kitche: :( no cylender menu or something like that in the bios section
[09:42] <Some_Person> i didnt install that sarge package
[09:42] <steveire> No one any idea?
[09:42] <LinuxHelp> I just installed Ubuntu 6.10, and I'm wondering whether my / is mounted with nodiratime,noatime ? Here is my cat /proc/mounts: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/yyFdZy80.html
[09:42] <Some_Person> maybe my dad did
[09:42] <furio_> apache2 is not able to see my FQDN... hostname -f also just returns the hostname, and that's all that's specified in /etc/hostname... if I add a domain name to /etc/hostname, is that the fix for this, or do I change something else?
[09:43] <IndyGUnFreak> sorry steve, no clue
[09:43] <Scorpmoon> I read flash 9 beta 2 is out for linux, how do I install it into Ubuntu ?
[09:43] <kitche> R9KMC: did you read what I pasted after you said you would tyr that?
[09:43] <kitche> R9KMC: if you didn't see it before  This error is returned when a read is attempted at a linear block address beyond the end of the BIOS translated area.

[09:44] <synjet> kitche: dload the tar file, untar it and copy the ".so" file to plugins dir of .mozilla
[09:44] <rickyfingers> qatsi: I think that might be the best thing to do - just use synaptic to re-install ndiswrapper,
[09:44] <LinuxHelp> What I'm also asking, is whether you guys think noatime,nodiratime is neccessary in a desktop machine that doesnt get backed up?
[09:44] <synjet> sorry, that was for Scopmoon
[09:44] <R9KMC> kitche: ok i will try it too
[09:44] <ab0z> Hello
[09:44] <rickyfingers> qatsi: or even just download source from sourceforge and compile it yourself, it's not that bad, I've done it before.
[09:44] <IndyGUnFreak> the instructions are on Adobe's site.
[09:44] <kitche> synjet?
[09:44] <mikeo1f> i did gksu "update-manager -c"  and it downloads the upgrade tool but nothing happens... how do i upgrade?
[09:45] <synjet> kitche: sorry, that was for Scopmoon
[09:45] <qatsi> rickyfingers: im trying that, but i think i done it before, so it might not work :(....i hate ndiswrapper, i should have a linux-compatible wireless card :(
[09:45] <rickyfingers> qatsi: ndiswrapper doesn't have a whole lot of dependencies to worry about.  then you know what you've compiled matches your running kernel
[09:45] <synjet> Scorpmoon: dload the tar file, untar it and copy the ".so" file to plugins dir of .mozilla
[09:45] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: click check
[09:45] <Scorpmoon> synjet, and the userfriendly way?
[09:45] <mikeo1f> i did
[09:45] <qatsi> rickyfingers: ok, ill try compiling.....
[09:45] <mikeo1f> and it said downloadnig upgrade tool
[09:45] <mikeo1f> then it closes itself
[09:45] <qatsi> rickyfingers: same error....compiling then :p
[09:45] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: it should than after checking for updates show a button on top that says there is a distro upgrade
[09:45] <mikeo1f> and nothing happens
[09:46] <mikeo1f> yeah and i hit upgrade
[09:46] <mikeo1f> and it downloads the upgrade tool and closes itself
[09:46] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: make sure you are up to date first sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  than try the tool again
[09:46] <dabju> Hi there! I really need some help now. I've been surfing the web for 14 hours straight. Compiled new kernels and stuff. I just can't get the wireless card going. What do I do? How do I go forward? Please help me debug
[09:46] <mikeo1f> do i have to change the soruces.list
[09:46] <gnomefreak> no
[09:47] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: what version are you on now?
[09:47] <mikeo1f> dapper
[09:47] <mikeo1f> running ubuntu-server
[09:47] <mikeo1f> but its running kde and gnome
[09:47] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: that might be why
[09:47] <IndyGUnFreak> 14hrs straight...lol, i hope you remember everything you've tried so you're not repeating.
[09:47] <MtJB> you and me, dabju
[09:47] <IndyGUnFreak> sorry i cant' help though.
[09:47] <mikeo1f> while how do i upgrade
[09:47] <gnomefreak> server kernels are not the same as the normal kernel
[09:47] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: try what i said
[09:47] <qatsi> dabju: look for your wireless card in the ndiswrapper list...
[09:47] <mikeo1f> is it going to break my system?
[09:48] <gnomefreak> no
[09:48] <gnomefreak> well upgrading to edgy might some people have had issues with it
[09:48] <gnomefreak> but the 2 commands i gave you ownt
[09:48] <MtJB> dabju, what kind of card do you have?  i have a linksys wmp54g
[09:48] <IndyGUnFreak> mike, you might consider backing up your files, and doa  clean install.
[09:48] <MtJB> it's a wireless pci adapter
[09:48] <IndyGUnFreak> thats what i did, and had no probs at all.
[09:49] <IndyGUnFreak> i've read a lot of problems on upgrading.

[09:50] <MtJB> ah, macbook pro.  mine is in a desktop system
[09:50] <mikeo1f> gnomefreak: asks to check for updates manually

[09:56] <R9KMC> after
[09:56] <chrisbittne1> my computer lags a lot when i try to play a movie........does that mean my drivers could be installed wrong?
[09:56] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: than do it without it but its a good chance it will fail and leave you unstable system
[09:56] <mc44> PinkFloyd: what command?s?
[09:56] <PinkFloyd> For the terminal, a list if there is one
[09:56] <mikeo1f> can i remove ubuntu-desktop when it finishes?
[09:56] <mc44> PinkFloyd: there is rather alot
[09:56] <bun-bun> R9KMC# did you partition manually? or did you let the installer do it?
[09:56] <deadhobo> Nvermind, I found it... Network tools
[09:57] <LinuxHelp> justin_, what I didnt tell you is that I did a dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda count=10000 using knoppix in between :/
[09:57] <cmweb> ljl, no i was not i about missed the buss. I need it to make change my mysql passowrd
[09:57] <PinkFloyd> mc44: I remember someone posting an ubotu command that shows common terminal commands
[09:57] <gnomefreak> yes make sure you use aptitude to install it so aptitude can remove it and all its depends
[09:57] <R9KMC> bun-bun: installer
[09:57] <mc44> !cli
[09:57] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[09:57] <PinkFloyd> yeah
[09:57] <PinkFloyd> thats it
[09:57] <PinkFloyd> thanks

[09:57] <price> Excuse me, but can anyone point me to the system requirements for Ubuntu?
[09:57] <rioghal> LinuxHelp, you wiped the MBR?
[09:57] <bun-bun> R9KMC# old system?

[09:58] <bun-bun> hmm odd
[09:58] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: than dapper is the safest bet
[09:58] <IndyGUnFreak> no, you might want to try a lighter version of LInux, maybe Puppy
[09:58] <cmweb> price, is it by compaq
[09:58] <linuxfanstar> hey anyone know any thing about automatix
[09:58] <LjL> cmweb: why on earth would you need to enable root to change a mysql password?
[09:58] <price> I think it's 128MB.
[09:58] <mikeo1f> lol
[09:58] <ro1> Hello anyone uses sawfish?

[09:58] <gnomefreak> mikeo1f: dapper is lTS
[09:58] <compengi> gnomefreak, hi
[09:58] <IndyGUnFreak> linux, automatix works great
[09:58] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell linuxfanstar about automatix | linuxfanstar, you have a private message from Ubotu
[09:58] <ro1> How do I gt it to work?
[09:59] <PGT2_turbo> DINK you intall ubuntu on ure ps3?
[09:59] <gnomefreak> compengi: hi
[09:59] <mc44> price: xubuntu should be ok, mch oighter than ubuntu
[09:59] <price> Not sure, cmweb.  Does that make a difference?
[09:59] <cmweb> http://www.psoft.net/HSdocumentation/sysadmin/mysql_pass.html
[09:59] <kitche> price; I would go with xubuntu though
[09:59] <ro1> as a sandalone window mnager?
[09:59] <PGT2_turbo> what error occusred
[09:59] <R9KMC> bun-bun: you mean old?

[09:59] <gnomefreak> !automatix | IndyGUnFreak
[09:59] <linuxfanstar> what about with edgy?
[09:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about utomatix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:59] <ro1> standalone
[09:59] <ubotu> IndyGUnFreak: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[09:59] <mikeo1f> then how will i get beryl running on it?
[09:59] <gnomefreak> compengi: busy
[09:59] <price> mc44: Yeah, I saw.
[09:59] <linuxfanstar> it seems like the edgy version is new
[09:59] <fuffal0> how big of a blank cd do i need to burn the 6.10 iso?  is 700mb enough?
[09:59] <gouki> price: Heheh. I don't think it'll run, no matter what 'buntu you use.
[09:59] <cmweb> price, i just want to know if you get it working i want ot do it aalso
[09:59] <The_Machine> hmm
[09:59] <linuxfanstar> shoud i install dapper use automatix then upgrade to edgy?
[09:59] <PinkFloyd> I remember someone telling me not to use rm by itself
[09:59] <Senesence> I have a Bash script: g++ -o ${1}".bin" $1  #Is there any way to cut off the .cpp from $1 and then stick the .bin on it?
[09:59] <compengi> gnomefreak, oh... work etc?
[09:59] <price> gouki: Why's that?
[09:59] <The_Machine> i didn't get a private message - how do i configure samba users?
[09:59] <gnomefreak> compengi: yes
[09:59] <bun-bun> R9KMC# i meant old as in terms of bios, p4 wouldn't fall into that category
[09:59] <LjL> linuxfanstar: no, you shouldn't install automatix at all
[09:59] <PinkFloyd> Is it "rm -i file" or something like that?
[09:59] <gouki> price: Because the computer is a 486 (=
[09:59] <gnomefreak> linuxfanstar: dont use automatix if you can avoid it
[10:00] <mc44> price: it should work :)
[10:00] <LjL> PinkFloyd: probably. it's a good idea if you have that an alias for rm, imho
[10:00] <ro1> When I login it goes to the desktop then restarts the login
[10:00] <price> gouki: I thought Linux was no respector of systems....
[10:00] <PinkFloyd> LjL: A what?
[10:00] <R9KMC> bin-bin: any solution?
[10:00] <gouki> price: I would go for Debian netinst
[10:00] <compengi> gnomefreak, i see... me too, alot of studies... too much depression =/
[10:00] <pascal> hi i'm new there and i try for the first time the xrc
[10:00] <mc44> price: xubuntu should be faster than win98
[10:00] <LjL> PinkFloyd: an alias. type "help alias" in a shell
[10:00] <gnomefreak> *WARNING* automatix talk and suggestions need to go into #automatix
[10:00] <linuxfanstar> i cant avoid it because for some reason my nvidia drivers arent working even though i am installing right one
[10:00] <price> gouki: Net install is out of the question --- only have dialup.
[10:00] <PinkFloyd> LjL: ok
[10:00] <bun-bun> R9KMC# i'm not a grub expert but from the description of error 18 i've had similar things happen long time ago under lilo
[10:00] <ro1> Is there a script I must run to login?
[10:00] <cmweb> Does aany one know how to enable root
[10:00] <linuxfanstar> i need the legacy and it doesnt work
[10:00] <Jinkguns> I'm trying to burn a disk, I'm getting this error: Some files have invalid filenames:

[10:01] <lupine_85> cmweb: sudo passwd
[10:01] <rioghal> !sudo > cmweb
[10:01] <odin> cmweb: just give root a password
[10:01] <lupine_85> usually you don't need to, though
[10:01] <gouki> price: Well, then try Xubuntu. And if it works, please report back. I would really like to know
[10:01] <bun-bun> R9KMC# you double checked all your bios settings relating to the drive?
[10:01] <price> I'll give it a go, gouki.

[10:01] <kitche> PGT2_turbo: umm you forgot the / also
[10:01] <PinkFloyd> LjL: What's the rm command?
[10:01] <compengi> gnomefreak, can you help me in one issue?
[10:02] <gnomefreak> compengi: what you got?
[10:02] <PGT2_turbo> i did with /
[10:02] <PGT2_turbo> still wont work

[10:02] <price> gouki: 'Cause my wife'd freak.  (;
[10:02] <gnomefreak> Senesence: what do you need?
[10:02] <LjL> PinkFloyd, if you type   alias rm="rm -i"  , then when you later type "rm" what will really be executed is "rm -i"
[10:02] <kitche> price: then go with xubuntu or slackware, since slackware is meant for i486 machines for right now even though it has a steep learning curve then ubuntu

[10:02] <dreamer> can anybody tell me how to turn on alt-codes? like alt-1-3-7 or something (for ASCII-characters and such)
[10:02] <PinkFloyd> LjL: So is the -i right?
=== ubuntu4alexej_ is now known as AV1611
[10:03] <gnomefreak> Senesence: might be better off asking in #bash
[10:03] <LjL> PinkFloyd: it's neither right nor wrong. type "man rm" to know what it does.
[10:03] <price> Thanks all.  Laters!

[10:03] <R9KMC> bun-bun: well, thanks i must go now
[10:03] <Dink> PGT2_turbo, no i have not been able to install ubuntu on the ps3, it needs a booloader hack or its own bootloader to work
[10:03] <ro1> isthere something I'm missing?
[10:03] <bun-bun> R9KMC# http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18
[10:03] <bun-bun> R9KMC# tried that?
[10:04] <PGT2_turbo> dink goto into pm
[10:04] <R9KMC> bun-bun: ok i will read the website
[10:04] <gouki> Dink: I think you need OtherOS to make another OS installation on the PS3
[10:04] <cmweb> Why in the world does linux have to be so complicated, Shouldent mysql start along with the box?
[10:04] <LjL> cmweb: yes
[10:04] <Dink> it doesnt work no need for pm i tried what you are suggesting trust me it doesnt work right now with the current setup
[10:04] <cmweb> mine wot
[10:04] <Bsims> cmweb: add the startup script to /etc/init.d?
[10:04] <IndyGUnFreak> itsnot that complicated, its just different, so it feels like your new again
[10:04] <ro1> cmweb: It's  probably not in your init.d
[10:05] <LjL> cmweb: how did you install mysql?
[10:05] <rioghal> PGT2_turbo, dink will have to id to nickserv in order to reply to your pm
[10:05] <PGT2_turbo> dink did it give you a rror or what?
[10:05] <cmweb> Well how do i go about fixing this
[10:05] <odin> cmweb: download bum...the bootup manager
[10:05] <cmweb> ljl, i used synaptic
[10:05] <PGT2_turbo> error(*
[10:05] <PinkFloyd> LjL: What about a directory? How do I remove it?
[10:05] <Bsims> PinkFloyd: rm -r
[10:05] <ro1> rmdir
[10:05] <PinkFloyd> thanks
[10:05] <ph8> if i know something is recognised - how can i find it's device pointer and mount it? -> it wasn't recognised as portable storage, just a 'dell device' - it's a dell pda
[10:05] <LjL> cmweb: type "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql* restart", do you get errors?
[10:05] <Dink> Errorr= stop trying you cant install Ubuntu on ps3 at this time wait until a Howto is out
[10:05] <Bsims> PinkFloyd: Oh was this linux or dos
[10:06] <compengi> gnomefreak, couple of days ago i entertained my friend to ubuntu he liked it, so he asked me to install it and teach him how to use it, but unfortunately he doesn't have internet, so i want to get some .deb files from my pc to his and some libraries that i will need to get the program installed on his system. how can this be done
[10:06] <PinkFloyd> Bsims: Linux >_>
[10:06] <Bsims> rm -r
[10:06] <IndyGUnFreak> comp, what version of ubuntu?
[10:06] <bun-bun> compengi# burn a cd?
[10:06] <Bsims> PinkFloyd: Most important command is "man man"
[10:06] <PinkFloyd> Bsims: rm: descend into write-protected directory
[10:06] <PinkFloyd> Bsims: That's what it said
[10:06] <cmweb> ljl, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33165/
[10:06] <mc44> PinkFloyd: sudo
[10:07] <sycho> How do I select sun Java 1.5.0 instead of the default java? I thought it was sudo update-alternatives config java but thats not working.
[10:07] <PinkFloyd> k
[10:07] <gnomefreak> compengi: download the .debs from packages.ubuntu.com (might still be down) i havent checked it
[10:07] <LjL> sycho: well, you need to install it first ;)
[10:07] <PinkFloyd> Thanks, that got it
[10:07] <gnomefreak> !install | compengi
[10:07] <ubotu> compengi: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[10:07] <Bsims> compengi: use a thumbdrive, copy the debs to to and dpkg -i *.deb
[10:07] <sycho> LjL,  I did. I installed Java 5.0 JRE from synaptic
[10:07] <gnomefreak> compengi: there are install choices for you
[10:07] <savvas> is it possible to make self-executable presentations for windows from openoffice?
[10:07] <kitche> cmweb LjL: it seems like cmweb is missing the mysql.sock
[10:07] <LjL> cmweb, unless you messed up with the mysql config files, i suspect that it's still a problem with your chowning of /var. what command did you execute exacttly?
[10:08] <sycho> LjL,  it keeps throwing the error -config not an option
[10:08] <LjL> kitche: yesterday cmweb chowned /var and as a result couldn't run sudo anymore (which was yesterday's reason for asking how to enable root)
[10:08] <cmweb> "/etc/init.d/mysql restart"
[10:08] <compengi> gnomefreak, but what about the libraries... as you know every package needs a certain library to be installed =/
[10:08] <IndyGUnFreak> you can download deb files for ubuntu 6.06 from http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/allpackages
[10:08] <kitche> LjL: ah yea that's right forgot about that
[10:08] <LjL> sycho: that's because it's "--config" with two dashes
[10:09] <gnomefreak> compengi: you want to install the system read the link ubotu gave you. you cant just download a deb install it and say system in installed
[10:09] <cmweb> ljl, /etc/init.d/mysql restart
[10:09] <LjL> cmweb: no, i mean what command did you type to chown /var
[10:09] <cmweb> ljl, chown root:root /var
[10:09] <sycho> LjL, thanks.. I'm a dumb ass..
[10:09] <ro1> Does anyone use sawfish?
[10:10] <LjL> cmweb: no, that's probably how you *restored* it (perhaps not fully). but you broke it before by changing the ownership to your own user
[10:10] <savvas> maybe chown -R ?
[10:10] <LjL> savvas: don't give suggestions ;)
[10:10] <cmweb> So i got to reinstall
[10:10] <cmweb> well this bites
[10:10] <savvas> why not :\
[10:11] <LjL> cmweb: possibly. but you'll just waste your time, if after you reinstall you start again messing with ownerships, root, and all those things.
[10:11] <savvas> it did work for me once ;p
[10:11] <LjL> !works for me
[10:11] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[10:12] <LjL> cmweb: can you just answer my question anyway - what command did you initially use to change /var's ownership, so that you broke sudo?
[10:12] <fuffal0> can i write files to a windows share from ubuntu
[10:12] <savvas> then all the "how to" guides for ubuntu should be purged by that logic LjL
[10:12] <cmweb> ljl, its like this i needed to chown i order to gain access to the www directory i made a link to it on the desktop i always do this
[10:12] <erUSUL> !samba | fuffal0
[10:12] <ubotu> fuffal0: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[10:12] <cmweb> ljl, chown -R cchance /var
[10:12] <LjL> cmweb: and you always do something completely idiotic
[10:13] <alecjw> how can i transfer pictures to my ipod? what format should i use?
[10:13] <LjL> cmweb: why not change the ownership of /var/www instead? every though, NOT, don't even do that. you just need to be a member of "www-data", that's all
[10:13] <cmweb> ljl, :-/
[10:13] <LjL> chowning /var is just stupid.
[10:13] <LjL> cmweb: so, now, *what command exactly did you use* to chown it?
[10:13] <compengi> gnomefreak, i didn't find anything in what ubuntu pasted, it teaches how to install ubuntu =/
[10:13] <cmweb> ljl, i used sudo chown -R /var
[10:13] <fuffal0> erUSUL, i know about samba, i was more curious if it works with NTFS shares, as I heard even with a samba client i would only beable to read, not write - is that true?
[10:13] <gnomefreak> compengi: is it already installed?
[10:14] <LjL> cmweb: finally. why did it take 10 minutes?
[10:14] <LjL> cmweb: ok, so your /var directory is completely screwed up.
[10:14] <cmweb> it didnt i told you in 8
[10:14] <odin> fuffal0: ntfs write is purely experimental at this time...even with samba
[10:14] <cmweb> then again i got to reinstall
[10:14] <gnomefreak> compengi: on the page at packages.ubuntu.com for a deb you will see red dots you need those packages too
[10:14] <cmweb> ljl, how do i become a member of www-data
[10:14] <LjL> cmweb: yes, or you could change the permissions for all the various directories inside /var manually. a daunting task IMHO
[10:14] <LjL> cmweb: "adduser your-user-name www-data", just like you make any user a member of any group
[10:15] <CyDrive> how do i install firefox 2.0?
[10:15] <cmweb> ljl, im still new to linux so i didnt know that
[10:15] <kitche> CyDrive: you using Dapper?
[10:15] <cmweb> ljl, but now i know
[10:15] <LjL> cmweb, if i guessed correctly, you're trying to set up a web hosting service. given that you apparently don't even have the slightest idea about any kind of security matters on Unix, are you sure that's a good idea?
[10:15] <CyDrive> yes im using Dapper
[10:15] <Jinkguns> I'm trying to burn a disk
[10:15] <josep> Hi
[10:15] <Jinkguns> But it is saying one of the files has a invalid filename
[10:15] <synjet> josep: Hi
[10:15] <Jinkguns> and there are thousands of files on the disk
[10:16] <josep> I have a problem with my ubuntu
[10:16] <compengi> gnomefreak, and if i want to install the restricted files to work like mp3 what libraries should i download for the person, and btw can i get all my libraries and deb files that i had downloaded while using repos?
[10:16] <Jinkguns> I have no idea how to figure out which one it is.
[10:16] <josep> all gnome works really slow
[10:16] <kitche> CyDrive: let me see if firefox 2.0 is in dapper-backports
[10:16] <synjet> josep: go ahead with the q, somebody would pick it
[10:16] <erUSUL> fuffal0: ?? you are talking about the windows partition in your hard drive?
[10:16] <cmweb> ljl, :-X
[10:16] <erUSUL> !ntfs | fuffal0
[10:16] <ubotu> fuffal0: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[10:16] <josep> I have an ACER aspire 1692
[10:16] <fuffal0> erUSUL, i know how to view them, i was asking about writing, which currently is "experimental" according to another user here - that's all i wanted to know :)
[10:16] <kitche> CyDrive: yeah it's int he dapper-backports repo
[10:17] <Jural> can anyone tell me how to start the live cd without having x starting?
[10:17] <gnomefreak> compengi: i think you need to look in /var/cache/**** for the .debs that you have.
[10:17] <LjL> cmweb, if you expose your "server" on the internet by giving a hosting service, and you get hacked into, and you WILL get hacked into, and you end up hosting illegal contents or doing other illegal things without knowing (because you've been hacked), you may end up in trouble. just saying.
[10:17] <josep> and I'm afraid something is wrong with gnome, it seems to be that is something related to the network beacuse It takes a lot of time to make connections
[10:17] <richardonnay> help please, before i ran the cd 6.1 it worked fine so i installed it and everything, then when i rebooted for the third or so time the mouse wouldnt work. i ran from livecd again and it wouldnt work then either. but 6.06 kubuntu had mouse functionality.
[10:17] <cmweb> ljl, all the files and folders except for the folder www are all root
[10:17] <kitche> josep: you using firefox?
[10:17] <josep> yes
[10:17] <erUSUL> fuffal0: see also !fuse
[10:18] <javaJake> Where can I get wpa_supplicant support?
[10:18] <erUSUL> !fuse | fuffal0
[10:18] <ubotu> fuffal0: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[10:18] <javaJake> !wpa
[10:18] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:18] <javaJake> Hmmm... nope
[10:18] <Bsims> I am looking for a good, inexpensive readly avalible webcam, that Just Works with no screwing around... Any ideas?
[10:18] <javaJake> I've already tried that page.
[10:18] <odin> cmweb: once you get this problem straightened out, consider that you can tell Apache (or whatever) to use a different root directory and solve your problem with access
[10:18] <LjL> cmweb: that's not the point. the point is that you're clearly quite clueless about Unix and Unix security -- which is fine, everybody's got to learn, but you shouldn't be setting up a public web host in those conditions. i can *guarantee* you that you'll be hacked into.
[10:19] <kitche> josep: try this open up firefox then enter about:config in your address bar and a bar will appear int he page and enter ipv6 and double click what comes up and firefox should be a bit better in speed
[10:19] <Jural> I have ati video onboard, have read through the forms but all suggestions do not work, install freezes at x startup
[10:19] <IndyGUnFreak> jural, try the alternate install cd
[10:19] <Jural> yes
[10:19] <cmweb> My uncle is a linux expert he is doing that stuff seting up and all for me im just to learn and mamage
[10:19] <richardonnay> hello...
[10:19] <Jural> 6.1 and 6.06
[10:20] <veet> amsn don't start
[10:20] <veet> help me
[10:20] <compengi> gnomefreak, are libraries also stored in var/cache/archives?
[10:20] <cmweb> freak this i cant even get into a conversation without being downed
[10:20] <gnomefreak> compengi: not sure
[10:20] <veet> ubuntu doesn't create .amsn icon in my home
[10:20] <jvolkman_> is there a way to figure out which source in /etc/apt/sources.list a package originates from
[10:20] <jvolkman_> ?
[10:20] <Jural> is there a way to start without x? I cannot switch to any terminal once it freezes nor kill x while it loads
[10:21] <IndyGUnFreak> veet, have you tried Gimp or Kopete?
[10:21] <odin> Jural: at the grub screen type 'single'
[10:21] <kitche> Jural: not that I know of that's why the alterntive cd was made
[10:21] <gnomefreak> jvolkman_: give an example
[10:21] <josep> thanks it increased my speed
[10:21] <josep> :D
[10:21] <Jural> rgr
[10:21] <IndyGUnFreak> jural, try the alternate CD.
[10:22] <veet> yes and works fine
[10:22] <IndyGUnFreak> ok...
[10:22] <gnomefreak> jvolkman_: apt-cache policy packagename will give you what repo a package is in apt-file will give you what package a file is in
[10:22] <richardonnay> grrrrrr
[10:22] <Jural> already have tryed both 6.1 and 6.06 alt cds
[10:22] <IndyGUnFreak> so i take it there's some feature on aMSN you must have.
[10:22] <Jural> am trying single now
[10:22] <kitche> cyDrive: did you try what I recommended?
[10:22] <veet> amsn doesn't restart
[10:22] <veet> boh
[10:22] <jvolkman_> gnomefreak, the first one is what I'm looking for, thanks
[10:22] <steveire> list ubuntu
[10:22] <gnomefreak> jvolkman_: yw
[10:22] <veet> 0.96RC1.1
[10:22] <Jural> I can get it up on gentoo no prob, but don't wanna give this system away with gentoo on it
[10:23] <steveire> is there a channel to get installation help?
[10:23] <odin> Jural: that will put you in single user mode and should not bring up X
[10:23] <veet> theresn't .amsn icon in my home after installation
[10:23] <Jural> rgr
[10:23] <javaJake> Can someone help? I want to connect to a WPA network, but WPA_supplicant doesn't get beyond the 4wayhandshake step
[10:23] <josep> My gnome takes a lot of time to start any application
[10:23] <josep> can anybody help me?
[10:23] <IndyGUnFreak> open a terminal and type amsn..
[10:23] <compengi> gnomefreak, i have a question on samba. the samba program was working fine few days ago but i don't know what had happened but when i tried to enter network servers i couldn't find my work place it vanished although i didn't play with any samba settings...  even i tried to restart samba it didn't work =/
[10:23] <IndyGUnFreak> see if that works.

[10:24] <gnomefreak> compengi: i havent used samba on ubuntu
[10:24] <javaJake> Can someone help? I want to connect to a WPA network, but WPA_supplicant doesn't get beyond the 4wayhandshake step
[10:24] <javaJake> I'm using ndiswrapper
[10:24] <javaJake> And NetworkManager
[10:24] <gnomefreak> i used it on fc2 when that was new
[10:24] <javaJake> Out of the terminal
[10:24] <odin> josep: to start, open a terminal and type 'top'. That will allow you to see what is tying up the processor and slowing things down
[10:25] <blekos> hello ppl
[10:25] <ryanakca> what package provides pkstat ?
[10:25] <IndyGUnFreak> veet, any luck with that
[10:25] <javaJake> If a WPA connection doesn't have the right key, does it stop at 4WAYHANDSHAKE?
[10:25] <josep> my cpu is clean
[10:25] <veet> Indy:
[10:25] <compengi> LjL, have you ever worked on samba?
[10:25] <blekos> i'm trying to install the all plugin but i get a message packet broken
[10:25] <veet> andrea@andrea-laptop:~$ amsn
[10:25] <veet> Segmentation fault
[10:25] <blekos> any ideas?
[10:25] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm.
[10:25] <IndyGUnFreak> did you download it, or install it from the repositories?
[10:25] <blekos> from repos
[10:26] <blekos> but i tried sudo-apt get as well
[10:26] <veet> no packet .deb from trevino's blog
[10:26] <josep> the only thing that consumes CPU is the Xorg process and only takes a 2.5%
[10:26] <veet> but doesn't works also 0.95 version
[10:26] <IndyGUnFreak> hang on a sec.
[10:27] <kitche> blekos: you got it from ubuntu official repos right? have you tried this http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/amsn/amsn_0.96RC1-1.deb which is from the official site
[10:27] <odin> josep: did you watch top while trying to load a gnome application...one of the apps that loads slow
[10:27] <blekos> yes
[10:27] <josep> odin: I'll try
[10:27] <blekos> no, i'll give it a try, buttt, how do i use this file? (newbie...)
[10:27] <LjL> compengi: yeah, meaning i have it set up on my server... i set it up some two years ago and never touched it again though ;)
[10:27] <IndyGUnFreak> i use GAIM, so i'm not super familiar with amsn, i've got it installing from the repositories now, i'll see if i can get it to work.
[10:28] <compengi> LjL, i have a question regarding it
[10:28] <Jural> Thanks, got it to the desktop now, had to set the color to 16, 24 was locking her up tight
[10:28] <josep> odin: the same, I only have Xorg that takes 2.7% of CPU
[10:28] <IndyGUnFreak> veet, i just installed it from the repositories, and it installed perfectly, went into the menu, etc... Ubuntu 6.10
[10:28] <josep> I takes 1 minute to open gnome-terminal...
[10:28] <kitche> blekos: dpkg install amsn_0.96RC1-1.deb try that
[10:28] <compengi> LjL, samba program was working fine few days ago but i don't know what had happened but when i tried to enter network servers i couldn't find my work place it vanished although i didn't play with any samba settings...  even i tried to restart samba it didn't work =/
[10:28] <The_Machine> how do i view a list of current smb users?
[10:29] <The_Machine> that i have configured in smbpasswd?
[10:29] <odin> josep: there aren't many things that can slow down loading. If it isn't a cpu issue I would suspect the drive may be slow for some reason...might be trying to deal with some bad sectors or some such. Do ALL apps load slow or just some of them?
[10:29] <veet> ok Indy it works, i know that but now it doesn't works in my pc
[10:29] <veet> Segmentation fault
[10:29] <josep> Just some of them
[10:29] <josep> for instance, Synaptics loads really quick
[10:29] <blekos> thnx
[10:29] <IndyGUnFreak> i have no logical explanation veet, it works fine for me.
[10:29] <veet> ok
[10:30] <josep> and I get an error when I start Gnome it seems that is waiting any kind of remote process...
[10:30] <odin> josep: yup....sounds more and more like a drive issue. That would be my first suspect
[10:30] <Fred_Sambo> ubuntu sketchy skunk
[10:30] <josep> Isn't the drive for sure because the CPU led is off
[10:30] <josep> mmmm
[10:30] <josep> I installed kubuntu
[10:31] <josep> and since that I got this issue
[10:31] <josep> I deleted all kde packages from synaptics and I restarted the OS
[10:31] <Fred_Sambo> !spam
[10:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about spam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:31] <odin> josep: I installed kubuntu over edgy and it messed everything up. I finally nuked the whole thing and reinstalled dapper
[10:31] <josep> :S
[10:31] <josep> bad news
[10:31] <Fred_Sambo> edgy is kind of sketchy
[10:32] <odin> josep: I would investigate further before nuking and reinstalling, but it is going to be a hard thing to pin down
[10:32] <josep> yes
[10:32] <fredJones840> ja .. edgy is real sketchy
[10:32] <IndyGUnFreak> fred, it works great for me
[10:33] <odin> josep: might try listing all the processes (ps -ax) and see if anything of kubuntu is still resident
[10:33] <IndyGUnFreak> as good as dapper, no prob.
[10:33] <fredJones840> i cant even get it installed
[10:33] <mc44> edgy kicks ass. *puts fingers in easrs*
[10:33] <fredJones840> heh
[10:33] <fredJones840> it freezes at the disk partition step
[10:33] <fredJones840> for me
[10:33] <mc44> fredJones840: on the live CD?
[10:33] <ToHellWithGA> http://thestonepedo.pastebin.ca/254433 how can i fix a broken apt source that fails in gzip?  apt-get update isn't working properly.
[10:33] <IndyGUnFreak> i see, well, i did a drive takeover, so maybe thats your issue.
[10:33] <fredJones840> ja
[10:34] <mc44> fretried the alternate CD?
[10:34] <fredJones840> im dl ing the alternate cd rite now
[10:34] <mc44> fredJones840: tried the alternate CD?
[10:34] <IndyGUnFreak> are you trying to upgrade 6.06, or do a clean install?
[10:34] <fredJones840> nope .. in the process of dl ing that now
[10:34] <confrey> hi everybody
[10:34] <fredJones840> clean install
[10:34] <IndyGUnFreak> alternate install will prolly dot he trick.
[10:34] <fredJones840> just acquired a decent lil laptop
[10:34] <compengi> samba program was working fine few days ago but i don't know what had happened but when i tried to enter network servers i couldn't find my work place it vanished although i didn't play with any samba settings...  even i tried to restart samba it didn't work =/
[10:34] <mc44> ToHellWithGA: probably a temporary problem?
[10:34] <fredJones840> yea i hope so .. really wanted to check edgy out
[10:34] <brush01uk> axturpnsw
[10:34] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, just think, once youg et it installed, you can struggle to get wireless going..lol
[10:35] <ToHellWithGA> !hi > confrey
[10:35] <fredJones840> haha right
[10:35] <IndyGUnFreak> thats one thing i can never do under LInux
[10:35] <IndyGUnFreak> granted, i've only tried twice.
[10:35] <confrey> hi
[10:35] <IndyGUnFreak> i just wired my house, it was easier, and didnt' give me near as big a headache
[10:35] <josep> odin I have a kdeinit process running
[10:35] <pascal> hi
[10:35] <fredJones840> hehe .. i like my wifi tho
[10:35] <IndyGUnFreak> understood
[10:36] <ToHellWithGA> some wireless cards "just work" with ubuntu.  i'm happy with my linksys wireless G card that did that.
[10:36] <mikeo1f> in firefox2 how do i flip through tabs with the mouse wheel?
[10:36] <odin> josep: try killing that process (kill -9 <proc#> and see if it helps the reload times
[10:36] <josep> ok
[10:36] <IndyGUnFreak> plus, i'm not entirely sure I trust wireless yet..
[10:36] <fredJones840> well if you do it right you shouldbe ok
[10:36] <IndyGUnFreak> WPA has made it a lot better though, and WEP will probably keep out all but the most determined
[10:36] <pascal> somebody is knowing how to print with a smartbase canon MP360 on ubuntu?
[10:36] <confrey> I need a little help, I can't compile the realtime-lsm module with module-assistant; it tells me some syntax errors in C code, can anyone help me?
[10:36] <mc44> IndyGUnFreak: government spies are after *YOU* :p
[10:36] <fredJones840> wireless technology is freakin awesome
[10:36] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, these idiots that leave their username admin and no password.
[10:36] <fredJones840> right
[10:37] <IndyGUnFreak> thats ok Mc44, reference my name, i have something whent hey come looking..lol
[10:37] <fredJones840> hehe
[10:37] <IndyGUnFreak> i like the idea of wireless
[10:37] <IndyGUnFreak> just not sure i trust it yet.
[10:37] <josep> odin
[10:37] <fredJones840> ja .. its still pretty new
[10:37] <josep> it was a kde process!!!
[10:37] <IndyGUnFreak> then again, i was scared to get cable access under windows for several years, because of the crap i heard
[10:38] <odin> josep: so.....now you need to get that process out of the bootup sequence <smile>
[10:38] <josep> Odin: how can I prevent this processes starting each time?
[10:38] <IndyGUnFreak> then i realized it was because most retards aren't running any sort of firewall, or trust software firewalls to do the work that a hardware firewall should be doing
[10:38] <IndyGUnFreak> i've yet to have a major security violation, even under Windholes
[10:38] <josep> odin: how can I do it? In which file is it specified?
[10:39] <odin> josep: everything that starts/stops automatically has a script in /etc/init.d and is linked to the runlevels in rc1.d....check 'man init' for an explanation
[10:39] <IndyGUnFreak> 90% is common sense..., 5% is not going to XXX sites,
[10:39] <fredJones840> me either
[10:39] <shingalated> Does anyone have any ideas of what app I could use for widgets in beryl?
[10:39] <fredJones840> haha fosho
[10:39] <IndyGUnFreak> 5% luck...lol
[10:39] <pascal> i use edgy and my printer is a canon smartbase MP360 how to use it with ubuntu?
[10:39] <dougsko> josep: you can also just chmod -x the startup script in /etc/init.d
[10:39] <pascal> do you know it?
[10:39] <fredJones840> right on .. jsut reinstalled woody
[10:39] <fredJones840> heh
[10:39] <fredJones840> fn old
[10:39] <IndyGUnFreak> pascal?
[10:39] <IndyGUnFreak> are you from GT?
[10:39] <odin> josep: you might check in the package manager to see if there is anything of kde still installed
[10:40] <pascal> i'm from France
[10:40] <pascal> besanon exactly
[10:40] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, prolly not you then

[10:41] <IndyGUnFreak> sorry.
[10:41] <josep> ok thnanks to all
[10:41] <nolimitsoya> im using xfce as wm, but i rely on k3b for burning and amarok for music. the default 'treat click as doubleclick'-style of kde doesnt sit well with me, and its very annoying when using these apps. how do i change it?
[10:42] <josep> I'll reboot now
[10:42] <ex_> just instal kubuntu and amarok starts building the collection then stops at 52% anyone got any ideas
[10:42] <confrey> I need a little help, I can't compile the realtime-lsm module with module-assistant; it tells me some syntax errors in C code, can anyone help me?
[10:42] <kitche> nolimitsoya: it's in Kcontrol
[10:42] <lucky__> np: [ ()  ] 
[10:42] <nolimitsoya> kitche, thank you :)

[10:45] <CharlieSu> Does anyone know the differnce between the denyhosts packages?  i see denyhosts, denyhosts-common and denyhosts-python2.4 ...  Anyone using denyhosts?
[10:45] <pascal> impossible to proint with my printer from ubuntu
[10:46] <lucky__> ummmmm
[10:46] <lucky__> may be old
[10:46] <lucky__> but....
[10:46] <waterpear> as in ubuntu doesn't recognize the printer or it just won't print even if you try?
[10:46] <lucky__> i'm sure there a driver to load
[10:47] <Nicky> hello
[10:47] <ph8> if i know something is recognised - how can i find it's device pointer and mount it? -> it wasn't recognised as portable storage, just a 'dell device' - it's a dell pda
[10:47] <pascal> or a compatible printer can be ok
[10:47] <lucky__> load other driver
[10:47] <nolimitsoya> kitche, i cant seem to find it. could you give me a hint? i feel like a complete idiot. :)
[10:47] <lucky__> yes

[10:49] <waterpear> uh...
[10:49] <waterpear> i have dosbox working with windows 3.1
[10:49] <lucky__> as y like......
[10:49] <waterpear> (sort of)
[10:50] <IndyGUnFreak> is gaim beta 5 out already?
[10:50] <kitche> Stegozor: what are you trying to run under dosbox?
[10:50] <Stegozor> waterpear : would it be possible for you to install it, just for a little test (very easy, the / character from the keyboard doesn't seem to work)
[10:50] <Nicky> come on u guys, I really need your help
[10:50] <waterpear> heh
[10:50] <Stegozor> so it's impossible to mount c: therefore dosbox is unusable...
[10:50] <pascal> btye to akll ansd thanks
[10:51] <waterpear> use the [autoexec]  section in .doxboxrc
[10:51] <kitche> Stegozor: I m instlling dosbox right now
[10:51] <Stegozor> if you have the same symptoms, I'll visit launchpad . thanks waterpear
[10:51] <narrchy> you guys suggest using Ubuntu instead of XP or Knoppix?
[10:51] <avitale> Hey all
[10:51] <narrchy> right now im using knoppix live
[10:51] <waterpear> my / key works in dosbox
[10:51] <avitale> is this the correct room fro ubuntu help?
[10:51] <Lattyware> narrchy: knoppix is live only
[10:51] <Lattyware> or at least designed to be live.
[10:51] <cybah> to bad my girl only wants to use XP otherwise i would not have windows in my house
[10:51] <narrchy> an enjoying it thoroughly but was told i should use Ubuntu for desktop
[10:51] <waterpear> avitale, yep
[10:51] <kitche> Stegozor: works here find also
=== tekton_ is now known as TektoN
[10:51] <Lattyware> Ubuntu is a desktop distro.
[10:51] <Lattyware> So yes.
[10:52] <Stegozor> Worse, dosemu doesn't work either from ubuntu repos (confirmed bug), I had to compile it from source...
[10:52] <dxdemetriou> I have set the /etc/environment to LANGUAGE="en_US:en" and LANG="el_GR.UTF-8", for english operating system to support greek, but the kde programs are translated too. for gnome is ok
[10:52] <narrchy> an downloadable too correct?
[10:52] <Lattyware> I'd say Ubuntu is a better choice/
[10:52] <Lattyware> *.
[10:52] <narrchy> i'm unsure of how to burn it to a cd
[10:52] <waterpear> Stegozor, what's stopping you from using qemu + freedos?
=== TektoN is now known as TektoniK
[10:52] <narrchy> can it be any cd-r?
[10:52] <mp3guy> my synaptic package manager won't lock my gaim package, can I do it on command line instead?
=== TektoniK is now known as TektoN
[10:53] <Stegozor> I don't know anything about qemu... I didn't even know it existed, I'll google for it.
[10:53] <narrchy> and is it easy to set up once i put it in?
[10:53] <avitale> I am having serious problem guys... When ever i try to open a terminal window or some other applications.. it takes a little longer than usual to open (+15sec.) and then disappears from the pannel, after checking the system monitor, there is its not running
[10:53] <Stegozor> kitche : are you able to type mount c /home/username/dosbox when you launch dosbox?
[10:54] <narrchy> is mandriva better than ubuntu?
[10:54] <Breetai> Is there some type of command line utility that can list installed true type fonts, xlsfonts and fc-list do not show my true type fonts.
[10:54] <mc44> narrchy: uyes, but this channel is probably rather biased :)
[10:54] <Lattyware> narrchy: Yes to both questions.
[10:54] <Lattyware> narrchy: We may be a little biased :P
[10:54] <narrchy> haha
[10:54] <avitale> Anyone have an ideas?
[10:54] <narrchy> understood lol
[10:54] <dxdemetriou> is there any place to find informations for locales? the bashrc doesn't work, and the /etc/environment in some places
[10:54] <TektoN> Anyone know any better drivers for an ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 than default ubuntu drivers?
[10:54] <Lattyware> To burn it, find a CD burning program that will burn ISOs (any linux one, most good windows ones).
[10:54] <Lattyware> And then burn the ISO as an image to the disk.
[10:55] <kitche> Stegozor works fine here
[10:55] <Lattyware> don't just burn the file so you have <whatever>.iso on a disk.
[10:55] <we2by> what does the program evolution do?
[10:55] <Lattyware> *disc
[10:55] <Lattyware> we2by: Email client.
[10:55] <narrchy> alright
[10:55] <kud0s> email
[10:55] <Stegozor> kitche: I'm doomed...thanks for the information.
[10:55] <narrchy> so what do you mean by an image?
[10:55] <we2by> erm, why are there 2 e-mail client with ubuntu?
[10:55] <avitale>  I am having serious problem guys... When ever i try to open a terminal window or some other applications.. it takes a little longer than usual to open (+15sec.) and then disappears from the pannel, after checking the system monitor, there is its not running.. Anyone have any ideas
[10:55] <kud0s> ad
[10:55] <we2by> what's better? evolution or thunderbird?
[10:56] <froo> we2by, there are much more... it's your choice!
[10:56] <Lattyware> we2by: Evolution is more like Outlook, Thunderbird is cleaner and more mozilla-y
[10:56] <Lattyware> For obvious reasons.
[10:56] <tom47> avitale yes i usually reboot and say ' ... and they say there is no bsod in linux ..."  ;-)
[10:56] <TektoN> I like Evolution
[10:56] <Lattyware> I recently switched from Thunderbird to evolution actually.
[10:57] <froo> why is that?
[10:57] <Wikipedia-Gast04> #bio.wikipedia
[10:57] <avitale> <tom47> huh?
[10:57] <froo> i found evolution much too slow
[10:57] <Lattyware> Evolution is more polished, and has more features in my opinion.
[10:57] <CharlieSu> anyone use DenyHosts?
[10:57] <Lattyware> I think Evolution Vs Thunderbird is like Opera vs Firefox. Interestingly, I use Firefox and Evolution.
[10:57] <froo> hmm, maybe now... havn't seen it in a while
[10:57] <froo> :-)
[10:58] <avitale> tom47: i have rebooted several times... also azerus is doing it as well
[10:58] <narrchy> Latty, i sent you a question
[10:58] <tom47> avitale it seems to need to clear its throat ... hae never tracked down why this happens (your problem) so i log out of X and come back and this usually fixes the issue
[10:58] <fredJones840> damn .. well here we go w/ that wireless config
[10:58] <froo> i switched from opera to firefox
[10:58] <Lattyware> narrchy: I don't see any queries....
[10:58] <tom47> avitale ok sound slike a diff issue
[10:58] <avitale> just do a quick Ctrl Alt backspace?
[10:59] <steveire> Anyone know much about installation options using the alternate cd?
[10:59] <avitale> <tom47>just do a quick Ctrl Alt backspace?
[10:59] <tom47> yes thats what i do
[10:59] <narrchy> once i download the .iso i do what prior to burning it?
[10:59] <avitale> \alrighty
[10:59] <kitche> steveire: what is your exact question?
[10:59] <avitale> i'll be back to let you know how i faired
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[11:00] <UKMatt> is there that much of a difference between xgl compiz and beryl?
[11:00] <Lattyware> narrchy: Nothing.
[11:00] <Lattyware> The iso just needs to be burnt as an image.
[11:00] <narrchy> ah i see
[11:00] <Lattyware> Most software will have an option 'burn image to disk' just do that.
[11:00] <Lattyware> Don't just burn the iso as a file.
[11:00] <steveire> kitche: Can I do the installation more 'interactively'. I think there's a menu under there that most do not see with base install, extra applications, grub install etc.
[11:00] <kitche> UKMatt: xgl and compiz/beryl is two different things compiz and beryl are window managers whiel XGL is a X server
[11:01] <kitche> steveire: check the oem install
[11:01] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: would AIGLX also be considered an X server
[11:01] <Fred_Sambo> !beryl
[11:01] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:01] <steveire> kitche: Do you think that's it?
[11:01] <dxdemetriou> Can I set the sound-juiser to can show greek language titles (el_GR)?
[11:01] <we2by> looks like evolution does not have a rss reader integrated
[11:02] <kitche> Paddy_Eire: well I consider aiglx as the X server since it runs with the X server while XGL sorta runs on top of X for the moment
[11:02] <narrchy> once i have the cd burned, will it just set up itself when i put it in?
[11:02] <avitale> tom47 no luck
[11:02] <Paddy_EIRE> we2by: use Blam Feed Reader
[11:02] <narrchy> and what will happen to my windows?
[11:02] <tom47> avitale ok sorry
[11:02] <waterpear> if you shrink the partition it'll just be smaller
[11:02] <avitale> tom47 its alright
[11:03] <waterpear> if you delete it ir'll die
[11:03] <avitale> I'm rather new to linux
[11:03] <waterpear> *it'll
[11:03] <kitche> steveire: yeha think that's the option you want there is an explanition someplace on ubuntu site about what the options do
[11:03] <Lattyware> narrchy: You will get a live CD version of ubuntu
[11:03] <avitale> tom47 I've tried to google it and got nothing... any suggestions?
[11:03] <Lattyware> and then you can install from that
[11:03] <tannerld> hmm
[11:03] <Lattyware> and there is a nice installer, which'll tell you everything.
[11:03] <avitale> tom47 (fortunately) Firefox  works
[11:04] <Lattyware> If you don't know much about partitioning - I suggest you read up about it.
[11:04] <Wespe> hi, is there a command to find out what distribution a system is running?
[11:04] <iwkse> kitche: which is better, compiz or aiglx?
[11:04] <Paddy_EIRE> we2by: "sudo apt-get install blam" or "sudo aptitude install blam"
[11:04] <ryanakca> what package provides pkstat ?
[11:04] <Lattyware> iwkse: The two are not equal.
[11:04] <LjL> iwkse: they've got nothing to do with each other. #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[11:04] <tom47> avitale i wish i knew what causes this too but in my case (in dapper) its only temporary
[11:04] <iwkse> uh
[11:04] <Lattyware> XGL or AGILX, Compiz or Beryl.
[11:04] <nanomike> Hi, does anyone know if i can send mail from my own postfix server through an other port then standard 25? My ISP is blocking port 25. I don't wanna use my ISPs smtp server.
[11:04] <iwkse> ok, clear now
[11:05] <avitale> tom47 how temporary.. lol
[11:05] <iwkse> so i turn it, with xgl and aiglx...
[11:05] <scoates> hi
[11:05] <scoates> after a while, Xorg gets really sluggish, and starts consuming larger-than-normal amounts of CPU every time I do anything. For example, the faster I type this, the higher my CPU goes. Moving windows pegs my CPU at 100%. How can I fix this (without restarting Xorg every few hours)?
[11:05] <LjL> iwkse: with *either* xgl or aiglx.
[11:05] <iwkse> ok
[11:05] <LjL> iwkse: and you use *either* compiz or beryl as a window manager
[11:05] <dougsko> nanomike: /etc/postfix/main.conf, either that or master.conf
[11:06] <iwkse> LjL: yes i catch it..i was just asking which is working better
[11:06] <iwkse> with ati...
[11:06] <we2by> guys, any backupp tool??
[11:06] <tom47> avitale ask again maybe someone else can help
[11:06] <Lattyware> iwkse: Best bet is to use AGILX, if you can use it. XGL is more CPU intensive, but can be used on more stuff.
[11:06] <steveire> kitche: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions#head-f7a1accd6e8e139773b9b334f964e209b6d9ff84 <<< That's the nearest I can find to any info on this. Can you do any better>
[11:06] <LjL> iwkse i think with ATI you're stuck with XGL.
[11:06] <nanomike> dougsko: Yes, but i can't seem to google/find what to put in it. So it will understand what port to use
[11:06] <dougsko> we2by: cron and tar?
[11:06] <ogamiitto_> Can I add songs to an ipod conected to ubuntu edgy with rhythmbox
[11:06] <Nicky> is it possible to play encrypted dvd's?
[11:06] <ogamiitto_> ?
[11:06] <LjL> iwkse: anyway join #ubuntu-xgl - that's the channel for that stuff. even if nobody's hanging around, just read the topic, there are complete howto's
[11:06] <we2by> dougsko: one with a gui :\
[11:06] <narrchy> latty, i wanted ubuntu to run from my computer instead of cd
=== Bueller is now known as sobpanic
[11:06] <iwkse> LjL: cause of Direct Rendering?

[11:06] <narrchy> i am using knoppix live right now
[11:06] <iwkse> LjL: ok, thanks
[11:07] <narrchy> an thought ubuntu was for permanent
[11:07] <Lattyware> narrchy: You run it from CD, then run the installer inside that to put it on your PC
[11:07] <we2by> one with options like if if I only want to backup my config files etc
[11:07] <LjL> iwkse: no, 'cause of some missing hardware acceleration feature
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
[11:07] <jsleeper> i wish he would decide if he wants out or in
[11:07] <narrchy> an if i do that, will i be able to have some sort of "dual boot" windows/ ubuntu
[11:07] <tannerld> hmm
[11:07] <nanomike> dougsko: Cool, thanks
[11:07] <Lattyware> narrchy: Yes.
[11:07] <avitale> Hey ALL... I am having a serious problem, my termial, Azereus , and some other applications are just disappearing from the panel after them are launched
[11:07] <jsleeper> oops, disregard last
[11:07] <narrchy> is that difficult to set up?
[11:07] <avitale> I have tried restarting the computer and just x-server
[11:07] <Lattyware> You will have GRUB - which will give you a menu at boot so you can choose between the two.
[11:07] <Lattyware> It's automatic.
[11:08] <Wodger> nicky if you dig about on the ubuntu help pages there is way to play encriped dvd's yes
[11:08] <narrchy> oh sweet

[11:12] <Jinkguns> I had a disk I cant mount.
[11:12] <Jinkguns> And I cant figure out the filesystem
[11:12] <Jinkguns> ideas?
[11:12] <Jinkguns> *have
[11:12] <LjL> Jinkguns: volumeid didn't help?
[11:13] <tannerld> ok this is odd
[11:13] <rioghal> Jinkguns, you dont mount a device, you mount a file system. if the device has a file system that cannot be read, or is not able to identify, then the device wont be usable.
[11:13] <tannerld> a few programs (terminal, skype, gaim, gedit...) will not open when I click on the icon. they look like they'll open, but then they don't :\
[11:14] <LjL> tannerld: launch them from the terminal and see what the error is
[11:14] <iwkse> tannerld: try to open from terminal
[11:14] <rioghal> tannerld, open those apps in a term and see if there is any error output
[11:14] <rioghal> hehe
[11:14] <tannerld> eheh
[11:14] <Jinkguns> rioghal: I'd like to figure out the filesystem, this is 10 year old research data that is important. If I have to, I'll compile a custom kernel.
[11:14] <Luzer> howdy all
[11:14] <Jinkguns> LjL: I don't know if I was using Vol_Id correctly or not. What is the proper usage?
[11:15] <Mersault> How can I configure ubuntu to use DHCP on eth0 to get ip/subnet mask, etc, but not set it as the default gateway? I have a pppoe connection through eth1 that I want to use as the default gateway. I don't want the machine be a router, but I want it to straddle both networks
[11:15] <Stanislav> Hello, does anyone know how to get Ubuntu to identify a GeForce 7600GT?
[11:15] <rioghal> Jinkguns, sounds like it might be UFS

[11:15] <we2by> if I can make the beagle-search window smaller, it would be cool :(
[11:15] <we2by> too bad I have a small screen
[11:15] <LjL> Jinkguns, i don't know, it just came from an APT search. if that fails what i'd do is use "hd /dev/whatever" (or some more advanced hex viewer/editor perhaps) and see if there's some string that can give you a clue about the filesystem
[11:15] <avitale> Hey ALL... I am having a serious problem, my termial, Azereus , and some other applications are just disappearing from the panel after them are launched ... I have tried restarting the computer and just x-server......Anyone have an idea?????
[11:16] <tannerld> LjL iwkse rioghal: Its not really saying anything; curser just blinks...
[11:16] <LjL> Jinkguns: anyway the usage should simply be "sudo vol_id /dev/blah"
[11:16] <rioghal> tannerld, is it just that one file?
[11:16] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell jovans about away | jovans, you have a private message from Ubotu

[11:17] <alejo> hi
[11:17] <LjL> Jinkguns: you have no idea what sort of computer that drive was being used in?

[11:18] <Jinkguns> hm
[11:18] <Jinkguns> I get no return data
[11:18] <brett_> odin, but how to create it? or update an existing one?  :-s
[11:18] <LjL> Jinkguns, that's a drive - filesystems resides on *partitions* on a drive. so, /dev/sdb1 or similar
[11:18] <avitale> Hey ALL... I am having a serious problem, my termial, Azereus , and some other applications are just disappearing from the panel after them are launched ... I have tried restarting the computer and just x-server......Anyone have an idea?????
[11:18] <Mersault> dougsko: where's the best place to set this so it happens after a reboot? rc.local, or is there someplace else (/etc/networks/interfaces, etc) that would work better?
[11:18] <LjL> Jinkguns: if there's no partition table, well... tough luck!
[11:18] <dougsko> Mersault: btw, a device that straddles two or more networks *is* a router
[11:18] <Jinkguns> LjL: No, no idea. Two of the disks are marked Unix, the other, no idea.
[11:19] <ogamitto> how do I put music on my ipod with ryhthmbox?
[11:19] <narrchy> how hard is cedega to find on bittorrent?
[11:19] <odin> brett_: no update....to change the link you have to delete it and recreate it. the command is 'ln -s <object> <linkname>
[11:19] <LjL> Jinkguns, look at the partitions. type "sfdisk --list /dev/sdb"
[11:19] <kitche> JinkGuns: do sudo vol_is /dev/sdb1 and see if it returns
[11:19] <Jinkguns> ID_FS_TYPE=hfs

[11:19] <brett_> odin, thanks
[11:19] <LjL> Jinkguns: then it was a Mac drive i guess
[11:19] <Mersault> dougsko: it's not routing any traffic between them, and I don't want people telling me how to configure the iptables for that. better to avoid confusion
[11:20] <Jinkguns> Its HFS?! Wtf. All the other disks are HFS! They worked fine!
[11:20] <odin> dougsko: unless it is a gateway <smile>
[11:20] <kitche> Jinkguns: the other drives were probably hfs+ whiel that one is hfs
[11:20] <LjL> Jinkguns, perhaps this one will work as well... when you mount the *partition* and not attempt to mount the drive itself
[11:20] <Jinkguns> LjL: These are SyQuest disks, 135 mb hot swappable disks from 1996.
[11:20] <dougsko> Mersault: well, you want it to happen after it does dhcp, so rc.local should work
[11:20] <LjL> well, apparently this one was partitioned

[11:23] <narrchy> is OpenOffice available for Ubuntu?
[11:23] <bhudda> Yes...
[11:23] <Ferret_> I'm trying to put Ubuntu on my iBook and the CD drive on it is dead so I can't use the CDs, all I got is an iPod, is it possible to install from that one?
[11:23] <Jaws> narrchy, it comes with it by default
[11:23] <narrchy> and can save as .ppt (PowerPoint) and .doc (Word) files?
[11:24] <bhudda> Yep!

[11:26] <Ferret_> Thanks, I've been searching around for a while only managed to come up with pages about installing linux -on- the iPod.
[11:26] <avitale> <tom47> but not with other apps
[11:26] <Jaws> tom47, hmm nvm i have no idea then
[11:27] <tom47> ty
[11:27] <dougsko> Ferret_: did you read the first link?
[11:27] <Jaws> tom47, only thing i can think of would be to make sure your display is on 24bit just incase
[11:27] <Jaws> tom47, because flash crashes my browser if its set to something else

[11:31] <LjL> tom47: or just "xdpyinfo | grep bits_per_pixel"
[11:31] <rioghal> Jaws, tom47 its best to use gksu or gksudo with gui apps rahter than sudo. sudo is for cli apps, gksu/gksudo is for gui apps.
[11:32] <Jaws> LjL, hmm ddnt know about that
[11:32] <Jaws> rioghal, oh ok didn't know that

[11:38] <dougsko> Ferret_: yes i know, thats what that how to is for
[11:38] <dougsko> Ferret_: you have to put it on it before you can boot from it and install form it
[11:40] <Ferret_> Why do I have to install ubuntu on my iPod? I got the CD image of the install file.
[11:40] <dougsko> Ferret_: maybe you can just put the .iso file of the install disk on it and boot from the ipod
[11:40] <kud0s> you can run ubuntu from your ipod?!?
[11:41] <Ferret_> Probably that's not my problem though
[11:41] <Ferret_> dougsko - Well I assume I gotta make the drive bootable some how.
[11:41] <rioghal> Ferret_, the install cd is bootable, is your ipod 'bootable'?
[11:41] <Ferret_> I'm assuming it isn't. I wanna find a way to make it.
[11:42] <dougsko> Ferret_: right, there a section in that last link i posted, about making it bootable
[11:42] <itrebal> thanks, LjL!

[11:42] <TektoN> Whats an RPM?
[11:42] <TektoN> Somthign Package Management?
[11:43] <kud0s> !rpm | Tekton
[11:43] <ubotu> Tekton: rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[11:43] <TektoN> haha
[11:43] <TektoN> ok
[11:44] <kud0s> as good as apt-get but i prefer .deb
[11:44] <graft> i'm not sure that there's much practical difference
[11:44] <unfo> TektoN: is there a certain program you want to install on your PC?
[11:44] <kud0s> I like .deb because heir supported in ubuntu by default =D

[11:45] <kud0s> Jinkguns: i think its something to do with the master boot partition
[11:45] <Jinkguns> yeah
[11:46] <Jinkguns> thats what I kind of thought too
