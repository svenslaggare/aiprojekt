[12:01] <globe> sethk: okay.  KDE is now prompting me with a setup wizart
[12:01] <globe> /wizart/wizard
[12:01] <LjL> TektoN: it definitely should
[12:01] <kud0s> Tekton: yes, assuming you already have the image for windows
[12:01] <poquedoraqu> im not looking for windows help, im looking for how to install ubuntu without access to anything but a floppy
[12:01] <zozue49> i have a problem with nautilus, can somebody help me?
[12:01] <sethk> globe, hmm, that's interesting.  It was supposed to give you a nice error message, it wasn't supposed to _work_  :)
[12:01] <LjL> TektoN: you just need a way to create a virtual machine first, but you can do that at http://www.easyvmx.com
[12:01] <dougsko> chopchop_: /etc/network/interfaces
[12:01] <TektoN> hmm
[12:01] <kud0s> !natilus
[12:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about natilus - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:01] <sethk> globe, might as well set it up, then we'll see if it is still broken when entered from gdm.
[12:02] <kud0s> !nautilus
[12:02] <poquedoraqu> i expect that #windows wouldnt know anything about that
[12:02] <chopchop_> dougsko: thank you
[12:02] <ubotu> nautilus: file manager and graphical shell for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 586 kB, installed size 1424 kB
[12:02] <TektoN> i would like VMware server to work.. I should be able to get it running..
[12:02] <khatahn> hi, can someone recommend a graphical tool for monitoring network traffic? something that shows more than just the total upstream/downstream usage, but not anything as advanced as wireshark. something like iptraf, but graphical?
[12:02] <globe> sethk: I did this: 'export display....' 'startkde &'
[12:02] <graft> ethereal, khatahn
[12:02] <LjL> poquedoraqu: like we can't be expected to know what a hal.dll or a system32 directory is ;)
[12:02] <zozue49> @kud0s: ok i already knew that :-D
[12:02] <khatahn> graft: wireshark is ethereal :)
[12:02] <kud0s> khatahn: MRTG although it requires perl and SNMP
[12:02] <graft> err.. wait, that's wireshark now, isn't it
[12:02] <NS_LapTop> poquedoraqu: just remove any reference to the Windows disk in fstab
[12:02] <poquedoraqu> all i mean is that i obviously messed up windows, which means i cant use it to configure *anything*
[12:03] <graft> wireshark isn't that advanced, anyway...
[12:03] <Jaws> Anyone have any idea on how to get logitech wireless laptop mouse working?  It doesnt seem to see it...
[12:03] <poquedoraqu> you dont understand. I dont even have a command prompt on this computer
[12:03] <kud0s> khatahn: sorry, ignore me
[12:03] <LjL> poquedoraqu: so anyway, you have the Ubuntu CD but you can't boot it because you can only boot from floppies? is that it?
[12:03] <globe> sethk: the loading screen (with the icons that says what it is doing) hung on window manager and then it died.  now its just X
[12:03] <poquedoraqu> Yes
[12:03] <TektoN> LjL email sent.
[12:03] <LjL> poquedoraqu: well what command prompt should you have?
[12:03] <poquedoraqu> i dont know. i dont have any
[12:03] <poquedoraqu> i dont have access to a single OS off the hard drive
[12:04] <khatahn> graft: i'd just like to see from which to which IPs stuff goes to / comes from, and how fast. iptraf is great for that, but i'd prefer something graphical
[12:04] <poquedoraqu> Just BIOS, then error messages
[12:04] <LjL> poquedoraqu, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto
[12:04] <LjL> poquedoraqu: this will allow you to boot the Ubuntu CD using a floppy disk
[12:04] <poquedoraqu> it wouldnt matter, because her cd drive is busted
[12:05] <LjL> poquedoraqu: so you only have network?
[12:05] <poquedoraqu> yep
[12:05] <poquedoraqu> a floppy drive, an internet connection and a messed up laptop.
[12:06] <poquedoraqu> i wish i had a USB cd player, but we cant afford one atm
[12:06] <iter> LjL: know much about fonts in X ?
[12:06] <LjL> poquedoraqu: then netboot it is, but you need another computer
[12:06] <mwql_aus> is it wise to buy a compatible pc card?
[12:06] <mirak> does anyone uses a serial to USB converter ?
[12:06] <LjL> poquedoraqu: what about a USB key?
[12:06] <grimboy> Hey, I've shoved a bunch of pcf.gz files into several places (/usr/share/fonts, /usr/share/fonts/misc and ~/.fonts) and they don't seem to be showing up in lists of fonts (specifically in the gnome default font selection things).
[12:06] <WarriorSlayer> guys i have an offboard soundcard that is called aureal vortex 8830 and i wanna know if ubuntu gonna recognize it and it'll work well
[12:06] <poquedoraqu> it cannot boot from flash drives
[12:06] <LjL> poquedoraqu: doesn't matter, you can still boot from a floppy
[12:06] <poquedoraqu> i *do* have another computer. mine. but its an ubuntu machine
[12:06] <s-ndh-c> hey guys
[12:06] <poquedoraqu> ohhhh?
[12:06] <iter> LjL: I have this config file that specifies a font like -*-helvetica-bold-normal-*-*-*-*-*
[12:07] <LjL> poquedoraqu, use https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto to boot from a floppy, and then follow the installing from USB howto for the rest
[12:07] <poquedoraqu> so if i connected my external, which has ubuntu, and booted to it from a disk, i could repair her files?
[12:07] <grimboy> WarriorSlayer, You could try putting in the cd and when it goes into live mode playing an audio file.
[12:07] <LjL> poquedoraqu: or use netinstall, but somehow i think that's harder
[12:07] <iter> LjL: ideally I'd like to use it with .ttf fonts
[12:07] <s-ndh-c> i cant forward x11 data to the display on my ubuntu box
[12:07] <WarriorSlayer> grimboy hmm ty
[12:07] <LjL> never messed with fonts manually iter
[12:07] <zozue49> nautilus copies everything in random order, please help
[12:07] <iter> yeah me either dang
[12:07] <LjL> !fonts
[12:07] <ubotu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto
[12:08] <ubotu> No fonts in flash? Install msttcorefonts, gsfonts, and gsfonts-x11 , No fonts in mplayer? see !mplayer
[12:08] <s-ndh-c> is this some configuration thing?
[12:08] <odin> poquedoraqu: how about swapping the hard drives in the two machines, installing ubuntu on her hard drive using your cd, then swapping them back
[12:08] <LjL> odin: on a laptop? :\
[12:08] <poquedoraqu> exactly. laptop :/
[12:08] <odin> LjL: sure...I swap my laptop drives all the time
[12:08] <poquedoraqu> i have a pc
[12:09] <poquedoraqu> i havent got the patience for a laptop
[12:09] <LjL> poquedoraqu, this is the USB howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick  -  i guess you just need to skip the parts about making it bootable, and use the smart boot manager on a floppy instead
[12:09] <GSF> hey
[12:09] <poquedoraqu> well thanks
[12:09] <grimboy> poquedoraqu, Patience?
[12:09] <GSF> what's the dir for mplayer codecs?
[12:09] <poquedoraqu> aka, stuff breaks
[12:09] <grimboy> Ah.
[12:10] <rioghal> can you use partimage to make a backup of the partitions in one machine then burn the resulting images to cd and use partimage to unpack the images onto the laptop hd? i do that to install ubuntu to several machines rather than running the installer on every machine
[12:10] <poquedoraqu> ive never had a laptop that didnt go bad in a month or two
[12:10] <Dev05> Hi everybody once again. I'm having some trouble using Gnome Themes under Master Edgy :) . Happens that only a few themes work. For example, the Linsta 3 theme will just change the color scheme and the controls start to get rendered with the Murrina Engine... Other themes just draw like "old 3d". Any clues?
[12:10] <graft> GSF: /usr/lib/w32codecs, usually
[12:10] <new_suse_user> is there a key combo to open up the task-manager equivalent?
[12:10] <mwe> GSF: /usr/lib/win32/ contains the w32 ones hre
[12:10] <mwe> here*
[12:10] <LjL> poquedoraqu: oh there's also this one that tells you how to boot from USB when USB is not bootable... using a CD, however. but i guess it would work with a floppy as well, with little changes (but i'd try the smart boot manager route first) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB
[12:10] <graft> GSF: err, maybe /usr/lib/codecs, as i seem to have
[12:10] <mwe> but /usr/lib/codecs as well
[12:11] <GSF> lol
[12:11] <poquedoraqu> alright, thank you, thats even better
[12:11] <poquedoraqu> ive got to go, iill try it out
[12:11] <totall_6_7> Here is a quick question: How can i get a list of all the packages that i have currently installed
[12:11] <poquedoraqu> i wish she would buy a real coputer instead of a 125 memory toshiba
[12:11] <LjL> totall_6_7: dpkg --get-selections
[12:11] <totall_6_7> thanks LjL
[12:12] <kud0s> a _real_ computer is one you make yourself, piece by piece
[12:12] <mwe> totall_6_7: dpkg -l
[12:12] <LjL> mwe: that one renders in a nasty way, though (namely, it cuts out long package names)
[12:13] <Yakubovich> does anyone know what grub error 17 means?
[12:13] <Crankymonky> Anyone know a way to get Evolution to show only unfinished tasks?  Or how to put tasks on the calender for days preceeding their due date?
[12:13] <GSF> graft: mwe: it's /usr/lib/win32. /usr/lib/codecs, /usr/local/lib/codecs, and /usr/lib/w32codecs aren't "sourced"
[12:13] <s-ndh-c> what could be the problem? i do something like DISPLAY="myip:0.0" program ,but i allways get a message that the display could not be opened
[12:13] <mwe> LjL: yeah
[12:13] <GSF> thanks
[12:13] <we2by> guys, there is something wrong with gnome-xchat. hope you fix it soon!
[12:13] <s-ndh-c> i asume the xserver on my box doesnt allow tcp connections or so
[12:14] <grimboy> Wait, why are bitmap font off by default?
[12:14] <odin> s-ndh-c: have you considered running via "ssh -X"?
[12:14] <GSF> we2by: that's the spirit
[12:14] <we2by> :)
[12:15] <graft> we2by: file a bug report, dude, with the appropriate people
[12:15] <s-ndh-c> odin: sure
[12:15] <s-ndh-c> but it doesnt work
[12:15] <Dev05> Any ideas on my issue? :)
[12:15] <we2by> graft, dunno how to file a report
[12:15] <globe> I am getting the error "could not start kstartupconfig" from my newly installed kde session, and KDE will not start.  Anybody want to help me get to the bottom of this?
[12:15] <odin> s-ndh-c: I haven
[12:15] <odin> t tried it under ubuntu, but it worked like a champ in suse
[12:15] <we2by> I'm using xchat right now and see if it crashes or not
[12:16] <Jaws> Anyone have any idea on how to get logitech wireless laptop mouse working?  It doesnt seem to see it...
[12:16] <GSF> graft, mwe: thanks again! bye
[12:16] <graft> GSF: maybe that's the dapper way, in edgy w32codecs puts it in /usr/lib/codecs
[12:16] <s-ndh-c> doesnt seem to work for me
[12:16] <GSF> I'm with edgy
[12:16] <mwe> graft: I think it puts some files in /usr/lib/win32 as well
[12:17] <GSF> I've grabbed the latest binary codecs from mplayerhq and they only worked in the dir I've mentined
[12:17] <GSF> *mentioned
[12:17] <GSF> yes, that's the one
[12:17] <mwe> graft: at least that's what dpkg -L w32codecs says
[12:17] <graft> ah, so it does... okay, i'll just shut up now
[12:17] <GSF> don't! your help is very appreciated :)
[12:18] <GSF> time to watch the movie now ;) bye and thanks once again
[12:18] <ubunta> hi
[12:18] <styvy> hi ubunta
[12:19] <grimboy> At  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto it says I can run sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig and get a way to reconfigure fonts. But when I run it just cleans up and updates a number of things. No configuration.
[12:19] <LjL> soundray: boo
[12:19] <ubunta> when i start gnome..the menus..are filled with lines..dont understand 1 text
[12:20] <LjL> soundray: recovery took a while didn't it :P
[12:20] <soundray> LjL: :-O  :-)
[12:20] <mwql_aus> anyone had experience with ndiswrapper, where the .inf file has information for more than 1 device?
[12:20] <ReporterX> Hello all!
[12:20] <soundray> LjL: no, once I was up again, I had to do a bit of work on my thesis
[12:20] <unfo_> all: how do i get apt-get to ignore all dependencies and just do what i say?  It's for an experiment.
[12:20] <grimboy> ReporterX, Hey

[12:21] <LjL> soundray: i was going to tell you (some hours ago), since the drive is under warranty, perhaps you want to make sure that some SMART parameter is actually below the threshold, so they'll have no excuses ;)
[12:21] <jackrazz> anyone here using Open Office's database to connect to PostgreSQL??
[12:21] <Dev05> mwql_aus, ndiswrapper loads .inf file that, AFAIK, contain support for just one driver...
[12:21] <LjL> !bonnie++ | soundray, or perhaps just a few runs of "shred", or some other stress-testing software
[12:21] <soundray> LjL: I was wrong, it isn't.

[12:23] <bigboy_> I am having trouble setting grub to boot from external dvd drive, any advice? I can,t even find the grub config file
[12:23] <LjL> !es | gay_
[12:23] <ubotu> gay_: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[12:23] <bthornton> I've noticed that running `hostname` on some machines, it returns the FQDN (i.e. "host.domain") and on others, it only returns the hostname (i.e. "host").  For examples, the FQDN gets reported on Fedora boxes but the Ubuntu just use the hostname.  Is something misconfigured here?
[12:24] <bthornton> ubotu hostname
[12:24] <ubotu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly
[12:24] <gay_> #hispachat
[12:24] <bigboy_> I am having trouble setting grub to boot from external dvd drive, any advice?
[12:24] <grimboy> ubunta, Try being a little bit more specific with your question.
[12:25] <azids_rhein> e
[12:25] <unfo_> what does 'e' mean?
[12:25] <azids_rhein> nothing
[12:26] <ubunta> grimboy ok..first the gdm just didnt start..so i remove it from init..now..startx ..run gnome..but dont understand nothing of the menus
[12:26] <bigboy_> I am having trouble setting grub to boot from external dvd drive, any advice?
[12:26] <mwql_aus> Dev05: the .inf file i have has information for multiple devices only, i cant find the .inf file for one device
[12:27] <soundray> bigboy_: don't repeat, rephrase
[12:27] <Dev05> mwql_aus, I then guess that ndiswrapper will load info for all of them.
[12:27] <Dev05> !tell mwql_aus about ndiswrapper
[12:28] <mwql_aus> Dev05: cheers
[12:28] <ubunta> bigboy_ google search grub
[12:28] <bigboy_> soundray the question can't be much clearer, I need to tell grub to boot external DVD drive
[12:28] <styvy> bigboy, to boot from external device you should check your bios to boot from usb
[12:29] <soundray> bigboy_: your question is very vague actually. How is it connected, what have you tried, how does it fail?
[12:29] <rioghal> i just updated HAL what do i have to do to use the new version?
[12:29] <bigboy_> I have dual boot OSX Ubuntu, My internal DVD is toast, and I ned to boot external DVD drive

[12:30] <rgg> hello everyone,i connected my scanner (a hp scanjet 2400) and it doesn't seem to be...on
[12:30] <bigboy_> The grub boot loader has 3 options x for OSX, l for linux, and c for CD rom, but that refers to internal drive
[12:30] <ReporterX> kde allow to disable anti-aliasing on fonts with a specific size (i.e. < 10). This is possible on ubuntu ?
[12:30] <rgg> where can i check if its "on",i hope you know what i mean.
[12:31] <bigboy_> check device manager under system rgg
[12:32] <soundray> bigboy_: is this an Intel Mac?

[12:38] <bigboy_> I can't even find it in /boot/grub/menu. lst
[12:38] <s-ndh-c> what i do is ssh -X othermachine and then DISPLAY="mymachine:0.0" someprogram
[12:38] <Graffiti> should i be running beryl with xgl or aiglx ?
[12:38] <soundray> bigboy_: can you pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst pls
[12:38] <s-ndh-c> and it just timeouts opening the display
[12:38] <bighil> s-ndh-c: you are using ssh? maybe try to use ssh -Y host
[12:38] <ubunta> i think..pehraps the cpu..is not supported at full
[12:38] <bigboy_> Is there no command line grub control that I can force to boot from external drive?
[12:38] <LuisMendes> suddenly, my system got muted! I can hear no sounds... what's going on?? I can't figure it out!
[12:38] <bighil> s-ndh-c: the DISPLAY variable should be set automatically by ssh...
[12:39] <ubunta> and maybe could be making something bad
[12:39] <s-ndh-c> it allways says cant open display
[12:39] <Mersault> How do I configure dhclient so that it doesn't set a default gateway?
[12:39] <ubunta> is the intel core 2 duo
[12:39] <Innoruuk> At one point I dropped the file libphysfs-1.0.so.1 into /usr/lib now when I use apt-get a message appears that says libphysfs-1/0/so/1 is not a symbolic link.
[12:39] <s-ndh-c> i know it worked like that on my gentoo box, whats different here?
[12:40] <ubunta> i use speedstep_centrino module.. is the same..
[12:40] <willwork4foo> Hi - I've got a printer installed on a windows XP machine and shared over the network - can I use that windows-shared printer from my Ubuntu Linux laptop?
[12:40] <Crankymonky> Does anyone use Google's ICAL with Evolution?
[12:40] <ubunta> is allways read/writing..i dont know why
[12:40] <rgg> sane is having some trouble too.i open it and it just goes blank while searching,and i have to "force-close" it.
[12:41] <mirak> edgy sucks, they built experimental modules into the kernel
[12:41] <mirak> CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH
[12:41] <mirak> this makes fail pl2303
[12:42] <CarCase928> i received an error when i attempt to play a live video broadcast, here is the error: Totem could not play 'mms://72.166.136.132/cctv4-200'.  No URI handler implemented for "mms".
[12:42] <cmweb> ljl, from now on if it involves the system i'm consulting you first,,,,, i don't want to reformat again
[12:43] <Vorbote> willwork4foo: yes, open the System->Administration->Shared Folders control panel and accept to install Windows networking support. After that you should be able to see the printer on your LAN.
[12:43] <VigoFusion> Hello
[12:43] <LjL> cmweb: good, but i'm not always around. what's important is that you consult *someone* - and that you make the right questions, i.e. what you need, not what you think you need
[12:43] <cmweb> ljl, copy that
[12:44] <s-ndh-c> does ssh x11forwarding work for someone else on edgy?
[12:44] <Vorbote> CarCase928: you need to install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly and bad from universe, as well as gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
[12:44] <cmweb> ljl, You were saying something about the security of the system. Wouldent i only need a firewall something like FireStarter?
[12:45] <narrchy> what is the .ico file
[12:45] <narrchy> can i create a ubuntu cd with that?
[12:45] <CarCase928> Vorbote: where do i get it?
[12:45] <narrchy> or is that the wrong file?
[12:45] <LjL> cmweb: not necessarily. Ubuntu comes with almost no ports open for listening by default, so unless you install services (such as a web server), firewalling rules are not needed
[12:45] <ElementalBelief> Hello, sorry to bother but could someone help me?
[12:45] <BlackHawk> gn8
[12:45] <LjL> cmweb: but then if you do install a service and want it to be publicly accessible, you don't want to firewall that service either
[12:45] <Vorbote> CarCase928: If the audio is in WMV9 format, you'll need to install gstreamer0.10-pitfdll as well as the w32codecs package from the PLF. (I wrote the packages are in universe).
[12:46] <Innoruuk> When apt-get says "libphysfs-1.0.so.1 is not a symbolic link", what does that mean? I dropped that file in there long ago.
[12:46] <cmweb> ljl, then what to do....
[12:46] <ElementalBelief> I am trying to install 6.10 using larp but its not giving me the option to do that when booting the cd.
[12:46] <unfo_> ElementalBelief: it is never a bother to interrupt on active conversations in IRC.  This is because there are many conversations going on at once.  See www.irchelp.org for more newbie tips.
[12:46] <unfo_> What is larp?
[12:46] <ElementalBelief> sorry i mean lamp
[12:47] <LjL> cmweb: nothing special. just follow standard procedures for installing and setting up services (i.e. apt-get and read the man), and if they fail, ask. don't start using random root commands (such as chmod and chown). do frequent security updates. and learn how the Unix permissions system works
[12:47] <Innoruuk> Elemental, boot it up in live and a install option should be on the desktop.
[12:47] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell cmweb about permissions | cmweb, you have a private message from Ubotu
[12:47] <ElementalBelief> haven't slept since yesterday, tried FC6 and just couldnt take it
[12:48] <kalikiana> A question: Is it normal that Abiword in Edgy won't import OpenDocument files?
[12:48] <cmweb> ljl, thanks looks as if i got some home work ;)
[12:48] <sorush20> anyone here using wpa spk here?
[12:48] <vasdas> hey hey, im new here and i have a small problem.. i googled it and was not satisfied with the search results... everytime i boot ubuntu off a cd i get this message on my screen "input not supported" ... i have a 20" acer widescreen.. could someone please help me?
[12:49] <LjL> cmweb: for example - the problem you had earlier that brought you to chown /var. by default, /var/www has "www-data" as the group. "group", for a file, means that any user who is part of the group can do some operations on the file (read, write and execute, depending on what group permissions are set). so, if you want to modify files in /var/www, you should ask your administrator (in this case, yourself) to make you a member of the www-data group.
[12:49] <LjL> the administrator does it by doing "adduser <you> www-data"
[12:49] <mwe> spk? you mean psk?, sorush20 ?
[12:49] <grimboy> Come on, can someone please help me. I can't enable bitmap fonts.
[12:49] <sorush20> mwe: yes sorry
[12:49] <rsavu> hello all. does anybody have a little experience in java? i'm having trouble with a method i'm writing.
[12:49] <mwe> sorush20: I'm using wpa2-psk
[12:49] <LjL> cmweb: type "groups" as your user. you'll see you're already a member of several groups - for instance "admin", which gives you the right to use sudo, "audio", which allows you to use your soundcard...
[12:49] <sorush20> !wpa
[12:49] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:49] <mwe> sorush20: have been using wpa-psk as well
[12:50] <sorush20> mwe: is there a good how to for it?
[12:50] <cmweb> ljl, So the system is basically run from permissions
[12:50] <mwe> sorush20: I'm not sure. I found something on google but I don't think I have a link
[12:51] <rsavu> http://pastebin.ca/254542 -> if anybody knows why it is returning a NullPointerException i'll be grateful
[12:51] <Innoruuk> rsavu: Ask I'll try to answer.
[12:51] <mirak> hi
[12:51] <Jupiter> Is there a gui manager for apache2?
[12:51] <iwkse> vasdas: what? you get "input not supported" when you unmount a cd?
[12:51] <LjL> cmweb: the system's security is based on permissions, yes
[12:51] <mirak> when do they provide fix for kernels in ubuntu ?
[12:51] <mwe> sorush20: and I couldn't get hidden ssid to work with wpa-psk. only with wpa2-psk
[12:51] <kalikiana> How do I import OpenDocument files with Abiword?
[12:51] <ElementalBelief> InnoruukI thought the server edition didnt have live
[12:51] <mirak> because there is a bug in edgy  for pl2303 and usb serial devices.
[12:52] <LjL> cmweb: there is one special user, which has ID 0 (known as "superuser" or "root") who can always do anything to the system - and as such, should really really know what he's doing
[12:52] <Innoruuk> Ele: Oh I'm sorry never tried server.
[12:52] <soundray> mirak: has that bug been reported?
[12:52] <shodanjr_gr> at random times, a while after it boots and its in the gui, it gives me a black screen with a cursor blinking, then throws me back to my login screen...anyone got an idea as to why this happens? (repost :P)
[12:52] <LjL> cmweb: other users can do things on the system depending on what permissions have been set on files. since almost everything on Unix is a file, permissions regulate just about everything
[12:52] <cappiz> someone here that could recommend a router with good peak in wireless encrypted traffic?
[12:52] <Innoruuk> rsavu: try encasing it in a try-catch.
[12:52] <mirak> the fix is know, but this means I can't use my usb to serial device before 5 month for next ubuntu release while the fix is known ?
[12:52] <mirak> soundray: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/39101
[12:52] <cmweb> ljl, right Root
[12:52] <rsavu> it doesn't throw that exception ... it is returning that exception...
[12:52] <vasdas> "input not supported" on my screen after i boot the computer up with the ubuntu cd... any help would be appreciated!
[12:53] <cmweb> ljl, k
[12:53] <Innoruuk> Oh then I have no clue.
=== jmworx__ is now known as jmworx
[12:53] <rsavu> i did a try-catch with NullPointerException and it does not do anything
[12:53] <iwkse> vasdas: isnt'a monitor problem
[12:53] <ElementalBelief> Trying to install the server with the lamp option it just doesnt show up in the list when i boot the cd. anyone have any idea on how i can get around that?
[12:53] <LjL> cmweb: every file can be marked as "readable" (r), "writable" (w) and "executable" (x). for each file, these three permissions are assigned to three different classes of users: the "owner" of the file, the "group" of the file, and the "others". you use the command "chown" to change the owner and the group, and "chmod" to change the specific permissions for each of them
[12:53] <Innoruuk> Wait, why is it returning an exception?
[12:53] <Innoruuk> Are you refering to it? That thing is a void method.
[12:53] <rsavu> i don't know.
[12:54] <rsavu> no .
[12:54] <iwkse> vasdas: what input devices do you use? (keyboard..mouse..)
[12:54] <rsavu> i call that method
[12:54] <soundray> mirak: CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH, contrary to what you report, is not set by default in the edgy kernel.
[12:54] <cmweb> ljl, thats where i messed up last time...
[12:54] <nolimitsoya> how can i parse apt severalcommands at once? fex, if i want to do apt-get remove lostirc and apt-get autoremove at the same time?
[12:54] <Innoruuk> How are you calling it?
[12:54] <LjL> cmweb: but whenever you're tempted to use those command, ask yourself first: is it the right way? does changing these permissions create site-effects? does it give somebody more privileges than they should have?
[12:54] <soundray> mirak: if you contribute to bug reports, it's really important to get your facts right.
[12:55] <vasdas> iwkse: logitech mouse and keyboard, pretty standard usb connected.. mx500..
[12:55] <cmweb> ljl, such as a restore or a hack attempt
[12:55] <rsavu> let's say that my code is embedded into a class named Population. i do a Population pop = new Population(); pop.generateTimeExclusions();
[12:55] <LjL> cmweb: and, generally speaking, you should never change the permissions of anything outside your /home directory anyway. /var is a bit of an exception, since you *can* put files manually there (for example in /var/www), but still much care should be taken
[12:55] <Stanislav> cansomeone tell me why my gnome panel wont load and crashes when i log in?
[12:55] <vasdas> iwkse: "input not supported" is floating on the monitor... nothing else
[12:55] <Innoruuk> I see.
[12:55] <LjL> cmweb: yes, and about restores - there is no such thing. most commands are just executed without a way of rolling back. so think thrice, always
[12:55] <bighil> rsavu: some of your variables is probably null. is evenimente initialized? is evenimente.get(i) null? ...
[12:55] <soundray> Stanislav: probably not, but maybe your $HOME/.xsession-errors can.
[12:56] <iwkse> vasdas: don't you use any other input?
[12:56] <Stanislav> is there anyway to reinstall the panel?
[12:56] <rsavu> it can't be null. i've done it with iterators too
[12:56] <cmweb> ljl, trice :P
[12:56] <rsavu> iterators is initialized through the constructor
[12:56] <vasdas> iwkse: nope. mouse, keyboard and monitor connected to the computer
[12:57] <soundray> Stanislav: the panel installation is probably fine. You can verify that: create a new user and see if the panel works if you log in with the new username.
[12:57] <nolimitsoya> could i perhaps do 'apt-get autoremove lostirc-'?
[12:57] <iwkse> vasdas: they are all usb? (monitor, mouse)
[12:57] <CarCase928> Vorbote: i am only getting audio and not video
[12:57] <rsavu> so, i really don't know what is null there;
[12:57] <cmweb> ljl, so can i go ahead and install the "lampp" System?
[12:58] <vasdas> yeah
[12:58] <pianoboy3333> What can play .mid files?
[12:58] <LjL> cmweb: sure - are you on edgy now?
[12:58] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell pianoboy3333 about midi | pianoboy3333, you have a private message from Ubotu
[12:58] <pianoboy3333> thanks
[12:58] <nolimitsoya> hey guys! i know at least someone in here is an apt ninja... :F
[12:58] <iwkse> vasdas: i meant, keyboard.. so monitor is usb too?
[12:58] <Stanislav> weird
[12:58] <cmweb> ljl, actuly i cant go to edgy i dont think. Laast time i tryed i couldent get my modem re-installed so no im not on it
[12:58] <Stanislav> it just loaded lol
[12:58] <bighil> rsavu: normally java says in the null pointer exception in which line the exception occured. in that line some variable has to be null. maybe you should use a debugger, the one built into eclipse is nice...
[12:59] <LjL> cmweb: that's ok, dapper will be fine. just slightly different
[12:59] <mwql_aus> Stanislav: did the panel crash after some modification? because my panel was stuck in the middle of a screen, until i removed the .gnome2, .gconf
[12:59] <LjL> cmweb: if you can't get PHP to work automatically, i should be able to tell you what to do
[12:59] <mwql_aus> Stanislav: hidden directories
[12:59] <vasdas> iwkse: lol... 21" widescreen acer vga monitor
[12:59] <CarCase928> i am attempting to play a live video broadcast, someone helped me, but not very good, i was able to get the sound, but not the video, can someone help me?
[12:59] <cmweb> ljl, cool. Thanks for the support
[12:59] <rsavu> i programmed for many years in c and php but i still don't know how to use a debugger :D
[12:59] <recon> Does anybody know a tr/sed command to extract extensions (delete everything after the frist dot including the dot)?
[12:59] <cmweb> ljl, il be back after the install
[12:59] <mwe> rsavu: about time you learn to maybe ;)
[01:00] <mirak> soundray: somebody explained me things bad, sorry.
[01:00] <ActivE> How can i tell what kernel i am running?
[01:00] <soundray> recon: man basename
[01:00] <mwql_aus> Stanislav: but i did have an older copy of the hidden directories
[01:00] <mirak> soundray: maybe you can precise my mistake in the thread
[01:00] <LjL> recon: "basename" if often used for that, but you have to specify which extension
[01:00] <bimberi> ActivE: uname -r
[01:00] <iwkse> vasdas: keyboard and mouse are connected to usb port back to pc or in the front panel?
[01:00] <mirak> soundray: so the problem is from soemwhere else
[01:00] <recon> that'll work. thanks.
[01:00] <Innoruuk> Is it safe to delete libphysfs-1.0.so.1 libphysfs-1.0.so.1.0.0 lib/libphysfs.so from my /usr/lib?
[01:01] <vasdas> iwkse: back
[01:01] <rsavu> and ... it says that on the line with timeExclusions.put(i, lateExclusion);
[01:01] <mwe> rsavu: when I first started programming I was debugging with printf() statemens in the programs. It gets really ugly though ;)
[01:01] <rsavu> lateExclusion is predefined
[01:01] <LjL> recon: a stupid shell command could be "echo whateverfilename | rev | cut -f1 "." | rev"
[01:01] <rsavu> and i is the iterator
[01:01] <iwkse> vasdas: try to remove the mouse, and reboot
[01:01] <mild7> I have a problem with bttv driver, is there anyone that can help?

[01:02] <wastrel> "ubunto"
[01:02] <LjL> recon: "basename" should be fine for that

[01:02] <Stanislav> i put in a new video card and i cant seem to get nvidia to recognize it.. itsa 7600 GS
[01:03] <Stanislav> it finds that its an NVIDIA but not a 7600GS
[01:03] <iwkse> vasdas: bah..from the error seemed something else..monitor was never an input device
[01:03] <soundray> mirak: sorry, I won't get involved in that bug report, seeing that I don't even have the relevant hardware

[01:03] <hadsa> hi, i need some help with ubuntu install... its crashing when he tries to install grub. Could someone please help me with this?
[01:03] <cmweb> ljl, Forgot to update the repository list, you wouldent happed to know the webpage on ubuntu.com where it gives a list of repositories based on a selection.
[01:03] <mwe> shodanjr_gr: it's not running?
[01:03] <bighil> rsavu: print(evenimente.get(i)) and print(evenimente)
[01:03] <LjL> cmweb: update it compared to what?
[01:04] <shodanjr_gr> mwe nvm, i fixed it. i had to install the inetd package :)
[01:04] <jshamash66> Hi, my ubuntu-windows network was working perfectly before (I have Samba and smb4k installed), but now none of my windows computers can find my ubuntu one, and vice versa. Could someone please help?
[01:04] <shodanjr_gr> thx though :)
[01:04] <vasdas> iwkse: thx
[01:04] <cmweb> ljl, theirs a page on ubuntu.com where you select System Type what type of update you want and some other things
[01:04] <ActivE> I just tried to install the linux-k7-smp kernel on my a64 dual core machine. It didnt give me the option to boot from the new kernel in grub. It did however destroy the nvidia drivers for my current kernel. Any idea what happened here?
[01:04] <kalikiana> jshamash66: if you didn't change anything it's probably windows - i'm serious
[01:05] <hadsa> im getting this RuntimeError: Install failed with exit code 1; see /var/log/installer/syslog and /var/log/syslog
[01:05] <mild7> could someone help with the bttv driver?
[01:05] <LjL> cmweb, source-o-matic perhaps, but it's not on ubuntu.com. but just pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and let me see if it looks decent
[01:05] <tyler> Hi guys do you know how i can update to 6.10 i cant figure it out
[01:05] <stalefries> !EasySource
[01:05] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[01:05] <wastrel> !upgrade | tyler
[01:05] <ubotu> tyler: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:05] <cmweb> ljl, yep thats the name il get the file
[01:05] <jshamash66> kalikiana: I might have changed something without realizing, but it's pretty unlikely. If the problem is with Windows, what do you think it may be?
[01:06] <tyler> thnx
[01:06] <recon> I'm trying to convert a folder full of .ogg's to .mp3's (due to player constraints.) Any ideas?
[01:06] <soundray> ActivE: run 'sudo update-grub' and see if it adds the newly installed kernels.
[01:06] <hadsa> anyone?
[01:07] <dafan> Ubuntu coupled with xgl/beryl is amazing.
[01:07] <dafan> I just installed and got everything up and running smoothly in 4 hours.
[01:07] <CarCase928> when i am attempt to watch a live TV Video broadcast on the internet, i am only getting audio, but not video, can someone help me?
[01:07] <shodanjr_gr> hm.... in swat, where is the place to add a new share?
[01:07] <soundray> hadsa: have you followed those suggestions?
[01:07] <cmweb> ljl, this is what the default list is, i have just rebooted my system (or i guess you would call it re-format) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33175/
[01:07] <kalikiana> jshamash66: from my experience, from time to time windows does things one cannot fix with anything but a restart because its network support is pretty buggy. most of the time samba is fully working but windows just doesn't want to work some day while the other day it works. of course there is a *small* chance you could fix it with random clicking. :/
[01:08] <jshamash66> kalikiana: haha ok, thanks for the help
[01:08] <hadsa> soundray: which ones?
[01:08] <rsavu> oh another thing. how can i free up space? i made 2 new logical partition of 5 gb's each. do i simply cp -a all contents from /usr and /home to each and then mount them from fstab?
[01:08] <ActivE> Strange, ive run sudo apt-get install kernel-k7-smp and sudo update-grub. There is no sign of the new kernel in grub. Im sure its doing somthign as it destroys the nvidia drivers. This is normal for installing a new kernel tho right?
[01:08] <soundray> hadsa: the ones you posted along with the error message.
[01:08] <hadsa> im kinda blind in here with irsii on a white terminal
[01:09] <hadsa> oh, theres just a "We're sorry; the installer crashed. Please file a bug report at..."
[01:09] <kalikiana> jshamash66: if you are 100% sure you didn't change anything for samba, you *might* ask a windoze guy, but probably a restart is all you need
[01:09] <soundray> hadsa: no, it pointed you to a couple of log files.
[01:09] <mirak> isn't ubuntu supposed to have a ubuntu+2 developpement release soon ?
[01:09] <LjL> cmweb, here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33176/ i have enabled Universe and Multiverse, and their respective updates and security repositories
[01:10] <hadsa> yeah, i took a look
[01:10] <LjL> mirak: +2? no
[01:10] <cmweb> ljl, thanks this is the one i got from the source o matic which is better? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33177/
[01:10] <soundray> hadsa: please run 'sudo apt-get -f install' and put the output on the pastebin

[01:11] <dxdemetriou> can I set character encoding on gtk1 applications?
[01:11] <CarCase928> Can't get live video to play (only plays audio), help!
[01:11] <LjL> cmweb: that looks fine, as well
[01:11] <soundray> dogie: yes, use the middle mouse button
[01:11] <highneko> dogie: Use middle click
[01:11] <hadsa> soundrayit ran just fine
[01:11] <AndyR> dogie, yes
[01:11] <mwql_aus> does ubuntu support plug-and-play?
[01:11] <cmweb> ljl, so that one?
[01:11] <dogie> ok thanks
[01:11] <soundray> mwql_aus: yes
[01:11] <cmweb> ljl, the one i showed you
[01:11] <tyler> hi
[01:11] <LjL> cmweb: whichever. the one from easysource is probably a bit more tidy
[01:11] <cmweb> ljl, o.k.
[01:11] <LjL> cmweb: they really are the same anyway
[01:12] <jshamash66> Also, lately while running Beryl, some applications have been opening with blank windows- only the border of the window, and the rest is filled with solid black. Should I just reinstall Beryl?
[01:12] <emilia> is it possible to authenticate my ubuntu machine on a windows domain?

[01:12] <tyler> i need to upgrade i
[01:12] <mirak> LjL: +2 like a stable testing unstable. because actually I am sure ubuntu is losing a big betatest user ressource by making the developpement version too elitist
[01:12] <highneko> jshamash66: That's an nvidia problem. Try executing "beryl -use-cow --force-aiglx; emerald'
[01:13] <cmweb> ljl, now comes the part that im not doing without guidence. editing. Can i use sudo gedit /ect/apt/sources.list
[01:13] <soundray> rsavu: either that, or use the tar copying method from the Tips-HOWTO
[01:13] <emilia> tyler:  gksu "update-manager -c"
[01:13] <mirak> LjL: for exemple I use linux for 4 years, and ubuntu since two. but edgy is to broken to even want to just report bugs.

[01:13] <Allz> or some :(
[01:14] <LjL> mirak, Edgy is considered stable. if it's that broken, there's something wrong with Edgy, not with the release system
[01:14] <jdahm> hey, I cannot get my wireless connection to find any of the wireless networks and even when I type the ESSID in manually and the password it still wont connect, is there some way to fix this?
[01:14] <xamox> how do I set my machine to boot to prompt? I now it used to be runlevel 3 but it's runlevel 2 by default and it's booting to Graphical login, I thought that was run level 5?
[01:14] <rsavu> i have some questions though. how do i mount them in fstab? will defaults work? if for example i am trying to run an exec?
[01:14] <hadsa> soundray http://pastebin.com/830153
[01:14] <LjL> cmweb: use "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
[01:14] <rsavu> any good suspend/resume laptop troubleshooting guides?
[01:14] <CarCase928> can't get a live video broad cast to play (i am only able to get the audio to play), is there some way to fix this problem, or is there a package that will allow me to play live video broadcasts?
[01:14] <cmweb> ljl, copy that
[01:14] <LjL> cmweb: you should use "gksudo", not "sudo", for graphical programs

[01:14] <cmweb> ljl, ok
[01:14] <soundray> hadsa: okay, sorry, somehow I thought this problem was related to a package installation.

[01:15] <cmweb> Ok it has been changed i am refreshing
[01:15] <soundray> hadsa: how do you get to this error?
[01:16] <hadsa> well, the first time at 95% it crashed with this error msg im going to pastebin
[01:16] <hadsa> then i triedinstalling it again and got the same msg
[01:16] <soundray> rsavu: if you created an identical copy (like cp -a would) you can just mount the target fs via fstab and it will work
[01:16] <jshamash66> highneko: that command gave me a bunch of errors- first it "Couldn't load plugin '-use-cow'", then "emerald: Screen 0 on display ":0.0" already has a decoration manager; try using the --replace option to replace the current decoration manager."

[01:18] <CarCase928> i apologise if i'm acting like a parrot in this room, but i really need help, i'm about to miss a good movie that is broadcasting live on the internet, and with this problem, i can't play the video part of it, i can only get audio, can anyone help me? that good movie is gonna play in a few minutes.
[01:18] <nn> soundray just some txt filwe
[01:18] <nn> file
[01:18] <VigoFusion> nn: can you take a screenshot, or save to a text file, or CD or whatever then continue?
[01:18] <jshamash66> highneko: actually, I can't remember if i changed it.... how can i check?
[01:18] <xamox> CarCase928:  What movie is that?
[01:18] <LjL> cmweb now, by the way, since you're on Dapper, you might want to consider using aptitude rather than apt-get. that way, when you remove a package, it'll know which other packages are not needed anymore ("orphaned dependencies"), and remove them as well. this is built-in in Edgy's apt-get, but not in Dapper's
[01:18] <narrchy> anyone know the answer to my problem?
[01:18] <cafe> question regarding - kernel versions - is there a way to load the 2.4 kernel upon install in dapper??
[01:18] <Phluffy> lol
[01:18] <kestas_> yay i got my got my webcam installed on linux
[01:18] <soundray> nn: what *application* were you working in? A text editor? If yes, which one?
[01:19] <kestas_> the problem is that it is way too darl
[01:19] <nn> VigoFusion i am telling you .All the stuff on the screen are frozen :(
[01:19] <kestas_> dark
[01:19] <nn> only the mouse alive
[01:19] <highneko> jshamash66: I don't know about that -use-cow thing, I was told to put that lol, maybe it wss a joke. Anyways try using the --replace option.
[01:19] <narrchy> what is a .ico is that the same as a .iso
[01:19] <kestas_> i dont know where to look
[01:19] <nn> just single txt editor
[01:19] <narrchy> because i thought i was downloading a .iso but it turned out to be a .ico
[01:19] <LjL> cmweb: the syntax to use aptitude is basically the same as for apt-get. "aptitude update", "aptitude dist-upgrade", "aptitude install ...", "aptitude remove ...", "aptitude purge ..." (this one's different), "aptitude reinstall ..."
[01:19] <wastrel> narrchy:  ico is typically an icon file.
[01:19] <CarCase928> xamox: it's a live movie, from a Chinese TV station, they broadcast over the internet.
[01:19] <narrchy> so where do you think the iso went?
[01:19] <dm_> Anyone know what repo NetworkManager is in?
[01:19] <ademan> when i try and run enemy territory it crashes and sends me back to the gdm login screen
[01:19] <VigoFusion> nn: Just trying to help, I am a totall linux newb. :-!
[01:19] <wastrel> narrchy:    the file command can tell you what kind of file you have.    file whatever.ico
[01:19] <narrchy> its on a windows machine
[01:19] <Phluffy> I've a question about updating in CLI, when someone gets a chance, no rush. Feel free to PM or post in the chat.
[01:19] <soundray> kestas_: most consumer webcams need daylight (as in outdoors)
[01:19] <nn> not open office stuff just simple txt .that i created on my usb stick .cause i have a little usb that i save all my work on .
[01:19] <mirak> LjL: well my opinion is that peopke have different level of linux knowledge and all can contribute the release of a release as stable as possible for absolute newbies. but with only stable and dev I feel I am considered a newbie, but I am sure I can contribute more, but the dev version brokenness prevent us to do that
[01:20] <TektoN> im trying to run ./configure ... i always keep getting the following message with several distros which utilize configure. Any ideas?
[01:20] <TektoN> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables

[01:20] <wastrel> er. iso
[01:20] <kestas_> soundray, there is daylight
[01:20] <nn> soundray :(
[01:20] <kestas_> it is just that the setting are low
[01:20] <rsavu> TektoN: u have no exec on that partition
[01:20] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell TektoN about build-essential | TektoN, you have a private message from Ubotu
[01:20] <narrchy> im hoping because i just spent 3 hours downloading it thinking i would be able to burn it onto a cd
[01:20] <kestas_> if i use camorama i can chang eit and make it higher
[01:20] <kestas_> but for some reason the previes int heat program is blueoly
[01:20] <lufis> How do I add options to a gstreamer pipeline? For example, running "flac --lax -mep -b 8192 -l 32 -r 0,16 input.wav -o output.flac" but in a way that gstreamer supports
[01:20] <soundray> nn: will you finally please tell me what editor you are using?
[01:20] <LjL> rsavu: don't think so
[01:20] <wastrel> narrchy:  get the md5 sum
[01:20] <narrchy> whats that?
[01:21] <cmweb> ljl, sorry i was away from the desk. Iim using synaptic for all that
[01:21] <Phluffy> I've a question about updating in CLI, when someone gets a chance, no rush. Feel free to PM or post in the chat.
[01:21] <wastrel> !md5sum | narrchy
[01:21] <ubotu> narrchy: To verify the authenticity of a downloaded ISO image.  Command:  md5sum /path/to/file.iso Windows users: http://slavasoft.com and grab Fsum 2.51 or also check: http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/winmd5sum
[01:21] <rsavu> hum :-/ maybe you're right. i always put my build essential as the first package
[01:21] <kestas_> but for some reason the previews in that program are blue
[01:21] <narrchy> alright thnaks
[01:21] <LjL> mirak, *shrug*, i bet they've thought about that when they decided the releasing scheme - after all, it all came from Debian, which *does* come in three flavors
[01:21] <soundray> !ask | Phluffy
[01:21] <ubotu> Phluffy: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:21] <wastrel> narrchy:  the place you downloaded the ISO should show the md5's for each one.
[01:21] <LjL> cmweb, synaptic will behave like apt-get in that respect (i.e. not remove unused dependencies)
[01:21] <Phluffy> :-x sorry, question inc...
[01:22] <hadsa> dont forget about me soundray :)
[01:22] <mirak> LjL: yes, maybe 4 even. with experimental

[01:22] <LjL> Nukez: probably editing the wrong file. it's /etc/X11/xorg.conf - and case matters

[01:23] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Phluffy about apt-get | Phluffy, you have a private message from Ubotu
[01:23] <wastrel> apt-cache search
[01:23] <mirak> LjL: unstable version of debian is a bit more stable than unstable. the dev status of ubuntu+1 make them broke to much thing
[01:23] <nn> soundray what do you mean :( just a simple txt file you creat the txt file by clicking on the mouse and creat a txt file :(
[01:23] <nn> i dont know what txt editor it is

[01:24] <narrchy> alright im going to try
[01:24] <soundray> Phluffy: 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'. Or familiarize yourself with aptitude -- nice once you get the hang of it.

[01:31] <KnowledgEngi> The system timer resolution is too much low. Rosegarden has not found a timer source to high resolution for reproduction MIDI.

[01:47] <Shinoda> is there a way to make all calls for a package point to another?
[01:48] <soundray> Shinoda: calls for a package?
[01:48] <Shinoda> ie, make the system take a package for another
[01:48] <nn> Anyone care to point me to a resource that might help with making a debian fork, such as ubuntu?
[01:49] <thor> Shinoda: create a link to package2 and rename it package1
[01:49] <Glz> soundray you forgott it :S?
[01:49] <jrib> Shinoda: why?
[01:49] <nn> I'm mainly wanting to actually build a complete ubuntu package system, optimized specifically for a specialized platform
[01:49] <Nukez> cybah: cool, that worked, thanks for the help :)
[01:49] <tux69> hi! can somebody help me with setting up nfs? i can mount the nfs share, but there are only empty top level directories
[01:49] <Shinoda> newest xchat asks for libdbus-1-2, but i have -1-3 and -1-2 isnt installable from the reops

[01:49] <VigoFusion> I am gonna work on vida doohicky, Thank you all for the help and assistance.
[01:49] <stalefries> !nfs
[01:49] <ubotu> nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[01:50] <cybah> yw nukez ;-)
[01:50] <soundray> Glz: I haven't been talking to you all day. I do remember talking to nn
[01:50] <Shinoda> so i'd like to try and trick it into using -1-3 instead
[01:50] <Glz> soundray that is me
[01:50] <Glz> i changed my nick :S
[01:50] <bimberi> tux69: This looks intersting - http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/HowToCreateYourOwnGNULinuxDistribution
[01:50] <nn> Huh?
[01:50] <bimberi> tux69: sorry, wrong nick
[01:50] <nn> Glz: Oh, sorry about the ghosting
[01:50] <Shinoda> thor thx, i'll try that
[01:51] <nn> nn's been my usual nick for a few years now :) (Stands for Nano-Ninja :)
[01:51] <bimberi> nn: that was meant for you
[01:51] <soundray> Glz: gedit doesn't seem to create temporary files. I don't know any way to save your work. Do ask the channel again, though.

[01:51] <nn> bimberi: I'm actually wanting to just build a ubuntu (exactly as it is), except for some different compiler configuration and so on
[01:51] <thor> Shinoda: I have done lib substitution like that by creating links to <libname.3.0.so> and naming the link <libname.2.0.so>
[01:52] <eugman> How can I download all of the source dependencies for a package?
[01:52] <nn> bimberi: the architecture i'm wanting to target is basically a P6 class CPU with some interesting quirks (Via Nemiah)
[01:52] <bimberi> nn: fair enough.  idk sorry.  i recalled that page and thought it might be along the lines of what you're after
[01:52] <Glz> soundray what do you mean :( just a simple txt file you creat the txt file by clicking on the mouse and creat a txt file :(
[01:52] <Innoruuk> eugman: Search for them in the repos :)
[01:52] <Glz> ups
[01:52] <Glz> not open office stuff just simple txt .that i created on my usb stick .cause i have a little usb that i save all my work on .
[01:52] <Innoruuk> They have -dev.
[01:53] <Glz> Awww wrong one
[01:53] <Glz> :(
[01:53] <nn> bimberi: I'll check it out, maybe i can write up a script to apt-get source everything :)
[01:53] <soundray> eugman: 'sudo apt-get build-dep packagename'
[01:53] <Glz> hello i need really help :S my screen is frozen and i cant do nothing the mouse is not frozen but all the stuff .and i was working on project school work :( and if i restart x-server it will go :S and i have to do all the work agein
[01:53] <eugman> whooray
[01:53] <Shinoda> thor where should i put the link, and where should the package be btw? (noob here)
[01:53] <thor> Shinoda: there isn't an easy answer....many of the libs reside in /usr/lib, but there are other possibilities
[01:54] <nn> bimberi: fwiw, that url looks like it might be promising :)
[01:54] <thor> Glz: you can restart X with alt-ctrl-backspace
[01:54] <esp05> heya
[01:54] <jrib> Glz: don't do that
[01:54] <Shinoda> thor i guess i'll just search for it then
[01:54] <jrib> he'll lose his school work if he restarts X
[01:54] <Glz> Thor shut your moth!! ******
[01:54] <nn> bimberi: I'm hoping to get ubuntu running on Via Nemiah better optimized than using generic 80386 binaries
[01:54] <Glz> if you dont want to help me then you can shut up thor
[01:54] <thor> Shinoda: you will need to find what libs are needed.
[01:55] <jrib> Glz: calm down, can you press ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a tty?
[01:55] <stalefries> Glz: he was being helpful
[01:55] <thor> Glz: done
[01:55] <bimberi> nn: you could roll your own kernel then perhaps?
[01:55] <bimberi> ubotu: tell nn about kernel | via /msg

[01:55] <ubotu> Glz: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[01:55] <nn> bimberi: ya, i've done that, i'm wanting to optimize libraries too :)
[01:55] <ademan> when i try and run enemy territory it crashes and sends me back to the gdm login screen
[01:55] <bimberi> nn: kk, i'll stop now :)
[01:56] <nn> bimberi: problem with the Nemiah is it has a very small cache (64kb)
[01:56] <ademan> anyone familiar with that problem?
[01:56] <socomm> ademan: Sounds like your xserver is crashing.
[01:56] <Glz> LjL i am sorry .i thought he was joking around .you know what happind last time .that was it .cause i was mad
[01:56] <Saribro> nn that's actually the least of it's problems :)
[01:56] <socomm> ademan: Most likely related to OpenGL.
[01:56] <nn> bimberi: so some compiler optimizations can very greatly boost system performance
[01:56] <nn> Saribro: Yea, well it's the one most plaguing me right now :)
[01:56] <Saribro> hehe
[01:56] <stalefries> nn: sounds like you want Gentoo :)
[01:57] <[emma] > heya
[01:57] <nn> stalefries: preferably not
[01:57] <stalefries> nn: I know, but that's what you'll end up doing anyway, if it's called gentoo or not
[01:58] <nn> stalefries: not really, i'm writing scripts to recompile the packages whenever my local ubuntu repo mirror gets new packages
[01:58] <stalefries> ah, well
[01:58] <ademan> socomm: well its actually a documented problem, but the fix i've seen (enemy territory trying to use a higher resolution than your desktop) doesn't work, since xorg.conf doesn't know of any higher resolutions than the one i'm running my desktop at
[01:58] <stalefries> sounds the same to me
[01:59] <stalefries> does anyone know how I can get NickServ to automatically IDENTIFY me?
[01:59] <socomm> stalefries: Depends on your irc client.
[01:59] <pvarma> ??
[01:59] <stalefries> socomm: x-chat gnome
[01:59] <eugman> On a single user desktop is there any possible advantage to a root user instead of sudo?
[01:59] <LjL> Glz, he's probably misunderstood your question. but he said something relatively innocuous while describing what it would do precisely -- if you treat people like that, you'll end up with no help. or banned.
[01:59] <LjL> eugman: i can't see many
[02:00] <socomm> stalefries: Bring up the server list and edit the network you wanna setup your user and pass for.
[02:00] <LjL> or any
[02:00] <nn> stalefries: I run ubuntu on everything around here that runs linux, much easier to have one standard distribution, particularly if i can avoid having some machines running a completely different distro.. I mean, obviously there'll sometimes be small issues from the recompiling, but if all is properly configured, packages will be built with the same configurations (Except using a few extra compiler/linker flags)
[02:00] <LjL> eugman: actually, one of the things sudo is handy for is *facilitating* work on single-user machines.
[02:00] <shodanjr_gr> hm....i did an apt-get install torrentflux and it didnt install the web interface ...
[02:00] <stalefries> socomm, thanks
[02:01] <socomm> stalefries: No problemo.
[02:01] <tux69> i already read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo but the first information i found was https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NFSv4Howto so i did it that way. when i compare the two, i only see a difference in the exports file where this pseudo file system is used in nfs4. i tried both ways, exporting a 'real' folder and a virtual folde. in both cases only empty folders in the mounted share on the client side.
[02:02] <stalefries> socomm, just NickServ password, or both NickServ and Server? I assume just NickServ
[02:02] <socomm> stalefries: Just nickserv
[02:02] <stalefries> thanks
[02:02] <LjL> stalefries: use a server password if you can, that's the easiest way to auto-identify
[02:03] <stalefries> LjL: don't got one

[02:07] <BadWolf> anyone have any ideas?
[02:07] <ubunto> mean that the gaim is not support the webcam
[02:08] <stalefries> britt, maybe more speed, dunno. But you will have trouble with other things

[02:08] <britt> stalefries: can you elaborate please?
[02:08] <nn> Kingsqueak: Hey buddy
[02:08] <britt> bimberi: that a 64 kernel will slow things down?
[02:08] <Kingsqueak> ltns
[02:08] <britt> that doesnt seem too logical
[02:08] <ScreaminIk1> quick question: how do i get the old x-zoom commands (C-M-<+|->) to work in edgy?
[02:09] <nn> Kingsqueak: Yea, it's been a moment or 30
[02:09] <cablesm102> I've added an anacron job to /etc/anacrontab, and it used to work. However, it recently stopped working. I made sure there are no typos in anacrontab, and I've tried running anacron from the command line and with the -f function, and neither of those work. I need help figuring out what's wrong with it.
[02:09] <stalefries> britt: doing anything besides installing officially supported packages will probably be harder. I've heard about all sorts of trouble over drivers, third-arty software, etc
[02:09] <nn> britt: No, it wont slow things down, but it'll run the machine in 64bit mode, and afaik there's things such as flash, etc that simply do not have 64bit releases still for linux, mostly binary-only stuff
[02:09] <bimberi> britt: as i said, no reference sorry
[02:09] <nn> stalefries: yea, that's binary-only packages (things that are closed source)
[02:09] <pianoboy3333> I have a question on modules, when you modprobe modules, like "sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel" can they also be expressed as say, snd-hda-intel? Is there a diff. between using underscores and dashes?
[02:10] <britt> well i can compile flash
[02:10] <nn> pianoboy3333: They are equivilent
[02:10] <stalefries> britt: no, sorry. No source out there for flash :)
[02:10] <stalefries> britt: if only it were that easy
[02:10] <cablesm102> Anacron appears to abort after it says it can't read the timestamp file for cron.daily. How can I fix this?
[02:10] <ScreaminIk1> anyone? how do i get the old x-zoom commands (C-M-<+|->) to work in edgy?
[02:11] <nn> pianoboy3333: They are usually named say snd-hda-intel, but modprobe tries both, because of compatibility purposes
[02:11] <aquarius> I can't get vncviewer to work in edgy; it complains about not being able to find fonts. Is this a known problem?
[02:11] <stalefries> ScreaminIk1: seems like no one does, I'd suggest googling

[02:12] <britt> so even deb files wont work with a am64 kernel
[02:12] <britt> ?
[02:12] <aquarius> bimberi: sorry, this is vncviewer failing, not a vnc server.
[02:12] <nn> ubunto: It's called samba, Look in your menu at the top of the screen, go to Administration, Shared Folders

[02:13] <RaiderX> Is there any other place to find more drivers for wireless adapters in ndiswapper?
[02:13] <soundray> britt: no, mythtv should be fine on amd64
[02:13] <TLE> Hey is there no python mode in emacs per standard and if not do you know which package to install I can't seem to find it
[02:13] <Kingsqueak> britt: I run amd64, for that, I would just go with 32bit unless you have enough background to deal with the codec workarounds etc.
[02:13] <pianoboy3333> I have a question on modules, when you modprobe modules, like "sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel" can they also be expressed as say, snd-hda-intel? Is there a diff. between using underscores and dashes?
[02:13] <stalefries> RaiderX: the manufacturer's website?
[02:13] <bimberi> britt: mythtv should be ok.  I've only really heard of issues with flash and w32codecs on 64bit
[02:13] <cablesm102> Does anybody know where Anacron stores its timestamps?
[02:14] <Kingsqueak> britt: you can work around most issues, but you need to be willing and patient to figure them out as you go
[02:14] <soundray> britt: but if mythtv is the main purpose of your machine, and not numbercrunching, it's probably best to install i386
[02:14] <britt> yeah
[02:14] <britt> thats what im running now
[02:14] <britt> seems fast enough
[02:14] <nn> Kingsqueak: how you been man? I've been insanely busy, living in NYC nowadays
[02:14] <Kingsqueak> britt: on the ubuntu forums there's an x86_64 section, read through that for a bit
[02:14] <stalefries> just go the easy way, britt
[02:15] <britt> so 64 only helps in the numbercrunching area?
[02:15] <Kingsqueak> nn new gig, very busy, much better than I was

[02:19] <nn> stalefries: Yea, i can build the machine myself if need be, but i'm looking for someplace to do dedicated server hosting cheap, with at least 50gb/mo transfer included in a cheap package (my blog gets far too many hits)
[02:19] <britt> well everything seems to work, thank you all much
[02:19] <stalefries> nn: ah, you _want_ a host
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: it blows my mind that I got 1G RAM, 250G sata, and a dual core 64 for $638
[02:19] <nn> stalefries: Yeup :)
[02:19] <britt> BIG diffence between a rambus P4 1.7 to a athlon64 3000+
[02:19] <stalefries> nn: I thought you wanted to self-host
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> it aint' fancy but stuff is so cheap for the power now
[02:19] <bimberi> nn: tektonic.net, for example, have unmetered (hence throttled) hosting
[02:20] <nn> stalefries: No, i don't have the connectivity for that until FiOS moves in fully here
[02:20] <stalefries> nn: I hear a lot about dreamhost
[02:20] <stalefries> though I know nothing
[02:20] <capiCrimm> soundray, but will that tell me without a service running on my port?
[02:20] <nn> stalefries: I transferred over 3tb last month and was politely asked to find a new host :)
[02:20] <VigoFusion> Kingsquek: Yeah, my bro picked this up, didnt ask or stuff, just brought it in and said have fun!
[02:20] <stalefries> nn: you must be pretty popular :)
[02:20] <soundray> stalefries, nn, please ask yourselves whether you're still on topic
[02:20] <stalefries> hmm...
[02:21] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: yeah I walked in and walked out in fifteen minutes with a new PC
[02:21] <soundray> capiCrimm: no
[02:21] <stalefries> better take my own advice and do this over /msg, huh nn?
[02:21] <nn> stalefries: That was a weird month, had a release of BioSim, speaking of which, i need to work on a ubuntu package of BioSim-free :)
[02:21] <Xorlev> nn: pixelfxsolutions.com has unmetered servers for $100 or so a month
[02:22] <stalefries> nn: try '/msg stalefries you message'
[02:22] <capiCrimm> soundray, see that's my problem. It looks like they are blocking all upper ports, and I want to sort through them to see if they missed any.
[02:22] <nn> Xorlev: Very nice, will check it out
[02:22] <Kingsqueak> nobody with unmetered will tolerate 3TB
[02:22] <shodanjr_gr> anyone familiar with setting up torrentflux? ive got a problem here :)
[02:22] <Xorlev> Guaranteed up to 15-20TB
[02:22] <VigoFusion> Kingsquek: Error I am haveing is the XPRESS 200 series ATI onboard I dont knoiw how to Xorg it or what.
[02:22] <soundray> capiCrimm: if you're not running services, all you can do is ask your provider.
[02:22] <nn> Kingsqueak: that's a very rare month :)
[02:22] <Kingsqueak> Xorlev: seriously?
[02:22] <britt> soundray: you're right
[02:22] <nn> Kingsqueak: avg is about 50gb/mo
[02:22] <Xorlev> Kingsqueak: That's what they say
[02:22] <britt> amd64 might help with recordings
[02:22] <britt> duh!
[02:22] <ademan> hey when you install proprietary nvidia drivers you're supposed to change nv to nvidia obviously, and comment out Load DRI, but wasn't there one more module to comment out?
[02:22] <shodanjr_gr> !torrentflux
[02:22] <ubotu> torrentflux: web based, feature-rich BitTorrent download manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1-1ubuntu0.1 (edgy), package size 410 kB, installed size 2688 kB
[02:23] <Kingsqueak> britt: it totally does, I do a bunch of transcoding and CCTV cap with mine and it's very fast
[02:23] <Xorlev> Once you get past 20TB they'll tell you to move up to a different bandwidth solution
[02:23] <britt> okay
[02:23] <britt> i'll switch over them
[02:23] <britt> any chance i could just change kernels instead of reinstalling?
[02:23] <soundray> britt: no chance
[02:24] <Kingsqueak> britt: it's more involved than that, libraries and core utils etc
[02:24] <RaiderX> hm ok, can someone link me to a tutorial on how to set up drivers with ndiswrapper?
[02:24] <britt> reinstall it is :)
[02:24] <Kingsqueak> !wifi
[02:24] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:24] <stalefries> !ndiswrapper
[02:24] <britt> ivtv works though in 64?
[02:25] <Kingsqueak> I don't know
[02:25] <RaiderX> theres no tutorial on the wifidocs wiki
[02:25] <RaiderX> either that or im not lookign right >_>
[02:25] <Kingsqueak> RaiderX: do a 'text' search for ndiswrapper or ndis
[02:25] <soundray> britt: there are amd64 packages for the utils, so it probably does
[02:25] <Kingsqueak> RaiderX: they're there somewhere
[02:25] <stalefries> !ndiswrapper | RaiderX
[02:25] <ubotu> RaiderX: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:25] <britt> okay
[02:25] <stalefries> man, that's not right
[02:25] <britt> so the only probelm i'll have is with w32codecs
[02:26] <britt> eg, like WMV and stuff
[02:26] <britt> not any mpeg stuff right?
[02:26] <britt> or divx stuff
[02:26] <Kingsqueak> britt: there's no problem there, it's that people don't understand and won't read
[02:26] <britt> lol
[02:26] <Kingsqueak> britt: you need to use 32bit apps with those codecs
[02:26] <Kingsqueak> britt: I have firefox running with mplayer plugin and all the codecs no problem
[02:26] <britt> Kingsqueak: i dont use those codecsssss
[02:26] <nn> Is it normal for smoke to come out of my computer after installing windows on it?
[02:27] <britt> nn: yes its part of the activation procss
[02:27] <Kingsqueak> nn that's the 'vista'
[02:27] <RaiderX> omfg i think i foudnit :O
[02:27] <soundray> britt: no, and even those aren't difficult to solve. Just follow the instructions from the guy called kilz on the forums
[02:27] <soundray> nn: you'll have to ask that on ##windows ;)
[02:27] <britt> :)
[02:27] <Kingsqueak> or just think about it and fix it yourself ;-)
[02:27] <britt> thanks guys
[02:27] <RaiderX> nope
[02:27] <RaiderX> this is specifically for some broadcom thing.. :/
[02:27] <britt> im doing commerical coding
[02:28] <Kingsqueak> britt: do read the x86_64 forum in ubuntu forums, great info in the sticky posts there
[02:28] <britt> and it used to dog down my 1.7Ghz p4
[02:28] <nn> Uh oh
[02:28] <britt> im at like 20% right now
[02:28] <VigoFusion> Kingsquek: will the ATI Linux drivers install and flow, or should I revert to a ATI 5800 PCI ?

[02:29] <Kingsqueak> RaiderX: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31926   just sub whatever driver you need
[02:29] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: mine is nvidia built-in, it works with either nv or nvidia drivers
[02:30] <Kingsqueak> RaiderX: you may need a bit of 'apt-cache search' fu to get the current versions but the steps should be the same
[02:30] <VigoFusion> Kingsquek: The Linux drivers make the Onboard ATI work? please say yes....
[02:31] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: I would think so, yeah, but I don't know
[02:31] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: I know there are some issues with Ati, but just check the forums
[02:32] <rogue780> how do I restart the network daemon?
[02:32] <shodanjr_gr> im gonna throw this thing out the window, i cant get torrentflux to workrkkkkk
[02:32] <VigoFusion> Kingsquek:its worth a try, ,I have seen those yes, ATI updated thier page yesterday on it.
[02:32] <rogue780> I thought it was sudo inetd restart but it no worky

[02:32] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: we have onboard ATi of some sort in Dells at the office and Ubuntu works on them, I just don't know what card specifically we have there.
[02:33] <soundray> VigoFusion: I had an onboard ATI that wouldn't work with *anything but* the fglrx binary drivers, so I had to install those via the text console.
[02:33] <stalefries> soundray: very funny
[02:33] <VigoFusion> Kingsqueak: Prlyy work with the Linux drivers then, Do I Xorg them in?
[02:33] <soundray> stalefries: thanks
[02:33] <Kingsqueak> shodanjr_gr: I'm thinking you don't have the mysql client/support enabled in php.ini
[02:33] <stalefries> clever
[02:34] <Kingsqueak> VigoFusion: I'd just see if the install works and run with that first

[02:34] <britt> does dvd::rip and automatix work in 64?
[02:34] <nanomike> Hello, Is there a way to send mail with a smtp server if your ISP block port 25?
=== borg is now known as botxj

[02:35] <ubotu> britt: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[02:35] <soundray> britt: automatix is deprecated. Use easyubuntu instead
[02:35] <soundray> britt: dvdrip works
[02:36] <britt> cool!

[02:40] <soundray> [erisco] : if you've installed it properly, you can get a list of files in the package with 'dpkg -L arkrpg'

[02:41] <nanomike> What i've found is that you can't use your own mail server to send mail via smtp if your ISP block port 25. You can transport mail to use ISPs stmp server for outgoing mail, for local mails you can use your own smtp server. Is this true? Or is there a way to set up your own stmp and use it to send mail.
[02:42] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: it's not so much that they block outbound mail, but they submit your IP to DUL and nobody will accept your mail
[02:42] <stalefries> nanomike: you could try setting smtp to a different port, although Kingsqueak has a point
[02:42] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: that's the best solution unfortunately, you relay outbound using them as a 'smart relay' with or without smtp auth depending on the isp, then you can still receive inbound if you use dyndns and setup the MX record
[02:43] <sn9> nanomike: my isp also blocks port 25, but accepts requests for unblocking under certain conditions. a lot is up to the isp
[02:43] <CptAJ[vzla] > crimsun: how do I input an archive's password? FIle roller greys out the option...

[02:46] <allz> [17:45]  <allz> hello i am just askin .if i keep trying to do windows stuff thorugh wine
[02:46] <allz> [17:45]  <allz> will i get virus?
[02:46] <allz> [17:45]  <allz> can it harm linux
[02:46] <allz> yes or no please guys
[02:46] <shane2peru> Hey, I broke gnome trying to install a new theme
[02:46] <__mikem> allz, no it won't
[02:46] <crimsun> CptAJ[vzla] : I use 6zr from a terminal
[02:46] <crimsun> CptAJ[vzla] : 7zr, rather
[02:46] <shane2peru> Does anyone know how I can fix that?
[02:47] <nanomike> Inbound is not a problem. Ok i can ask them. "Kingsqueak: it's not so much that they block outbound mail..." I think thay block port 25 and force you to use there stmp server, the IP block is an other isue for me i think. Even if i use an other port in my config i still have to connect to recipents mail server to who listens to port 25 for example mx.hotmail.com
[02:47] <__mikem> allz wine doesn't work well enough for the most part for viruses to work in linux
[02:47] <nanomike> So i can't deliver mail when port 25 is blocked then
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> if they truly block outbound 25, then no
[02:48] <jrib> shane2peru: how is it broken exactly?
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> it's more often that your IP comes up as spam blackhole though and people just reject your mail
[02:48] <shane2peru> when I boot into Gnome, nothing shows up jrib, it is blank, no errors or nothing.
[02:49] <jrib> shane2peru: how did you install the new theme?
[02:49] <shodanjr_gr> why the heck does apache give me a 404 error when trying to access torrentflux web interface over it? The folder is in /var/www/
[02:49] <shane2peru> Used System - Prefrences - Themes - Install New Theme
[02:49] <soundray> shane2peru: log out, log into a "Failsafe" sessions, "mkdir gnome-backup ; mv .gnome* gnome-backup ; mv .gconf* gnome-backup'. On the next normal login, you will start with a fresh gnome config
[02:49] <shane2peru> That is when it started to crash.
[02:49] <nanomike> Yes i am aware of that. Thanks for all the answers, bringing some light to this
[02:49] <shane2peru> I tried Failsafe, it don't work either.
[02:50] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: it's all because of spammers, pain in the neck
[02:50] <jrib> shane2peru: weird, did you try creating a new user?
[02:50] <shane2peru> the panel just pops up (empty) and then disappears.
[02:50] <shane2peru> No, didn't think of that.
[02:50] <shane2peru> I can do that through kde?
[02:50] <[erisco] > hey uh, I was just using the game "blast" and it left holes in everything... how do I refresh all my windows? or my desktop.. whichever
[02:51] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Yes, I know :/ And even if thay allowd port 25. Poorly configured mail servers are quick to get trageted i've red
[02:51] <jrib> shane2peru: I don't use kde, but probably.  Alterntaively, press ctrl-alt-f1, login, 'sudo adduser my_new_user', press ctrl-alt-f7, login with new user into gnome
[02:51] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: yup, I highly recommend postfix if you are new to this, the configs are plain english and easy to maneuver compared to other alternatives
[02:51] <shodanjr_gr> why the heck does apache give me a 404 error when trying to access torrentflux web interface over it? The folder is in /var/www/ ??? please help me out, im gona slash my wrists with my ubuntu disc
[02:52] <Stanislav> there is no sound for some  reason on my ubuntu
[02:52] <Stanislav> is there some way to reinstall the driverS?
[02:53] <crimsun> Stanislav: what audio chipset do you use?
[02:53] <Stanislav> secletme look it up for u
[02:53] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Yes, i've installed apt-get mailx witch postfix is included. I had no problem setting up postfix

[02:53] <JackHanna> I've searched all over the forum and can't find answer. The lcd switch is not being recognized on my HP laptop. Everything else works though
[02:54] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: nice...back in my dayyyyy I had to configure sendmail.cf without m4 or documentation...in the snow
[02:54] <Kingsqueak> I love postfix
[02:54] <Stanislav> they were working before
[02:54] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: I now transport outgoing mail and use ISP as smtp server. My users can use my mail server. But my server is not really sending the mail
[02:54] <sn9> Stanislav: it's usually a configuration or settings issue, but a few drivers are just plain broken
[02:54] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: right, that's how I'm setup
[02:55] <Stanislav> how would i reconfigure the sound ?
[02:55] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: yeah i've heard ppl swer sendmail :)
[02:55] <crimsun_> Stanislav: please pastebin the output from ``amixer''
[02:55] <JackHanna> anyone think of better search words, lid switch, lcd switch...
[02:55] <JackHanna> suspend works but the close lid switch isn't
[02:55] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: complicated stuff :)
[02:55] <sn9> JackHanna: is it an older or newer hp?
[02:55] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: yeah it's a combination of the odd configure method and some old but notorious security issues it had
[02:55] <JackHanna> newer, nc6120
[02:56] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: it does start to make sense if you dig into it enough, but I still prefer postfix
[02:56] <shane2peru> jrib:  - Thanks!  I'm in!
[02:56] <allz> someone knowz how to kill program that is frozen on my screen?
[02:56] <Stanislav> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/830210
[02:56] <Stanislav> there
[02:56] <shane2peru> I will have to reconfigure Gnome, to look more to my tastes, but at least I'm back in.
[02:56] <stalefries> allz: command line: 'killall app-name'
[02:56] <jrib> shane2peru: ok, now we need to figure out exactly what get messed up with your old user
[02:56] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: it might be a bit early for this but look at sasl authentication with postfix, you can use your home mail server to relay mail from wherever, using authentication for the connect, can be handy
[02:57] <shane2peru> That would be good.
[02:57] <jrib> shane2peru: do you happen to know where gnome stores your theme preference?
[02:57] <crimsun_> Stanislav: your 'PCM' is muted and zeroed.
[02:57] <shane2peru> I'm not sure about that one.
[02:57] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: ideally it shouldn't allow relaying except from an internal network unless you have sasl auth enabled
[02:57] <JackHanna> need help with lcd lid close switch..
[02:57] <jrib> shane2peru: ok, let's google :)
[02:57] <shane2peru> is it .gnome under the /home?
[02:57] <jrib> shane2peru: it may be a gconf setting
[02:58] <Stanislav> well i feel dumb
[02:58] <Stanislav> lol
[02:58] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: YTeah. I had no trubble with postfix. Cool i'll have a look.
[02:58] <allz> but how to check what proccess are runing so i can check what to kill .cause i dont know what the program is that is runing on my screen it is x-fire .but when i do the command the system cannot find it :S
[02:58] <crimsun_> Stanislav: shrug, it happens to the best & worst of us, don't feel bad.
[02:58] <Stanislav> =)
[02:58] <emacsen> If I'm having hardware issues with Ubuntu, where's the right forum to join?
[02:58] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: I just got vmware setup so i have an ubuntu to mess around with
[02:58] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: sasl is a bit tedious, but enabling it in postfix is relatively simple, you just have to realize it's a user database and you are pointing postfix at it to authenticate incoming relay connections
[02:59] <JackHanna> emacsen how about http://www.ubuntuforums.org/
[02:59] <emacsen> JackHanna: I don't know. is that the right place? Not a mailing list?
[02:59] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: I found some good howtos, thank you
[02:59] <JackHanna> ya... that's the right place..
[02:59] <sn9> emacsen: there are mailing lists too
[03:00] <stalefries> emacsen: every place is the right place! :P
[03:00] <JackHanna> if you go to www.ubuntu.com and click on community it lists web forums mail lists irc rooms....
[03:00] <sethk> emacsen, depends what type of hardware problem.
[03:00] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: I found postfix pretty easy to set up when following howtos and pretty easy to understand the basics.
[03:00] <NoStop> is it possible to get smart working from an external USB2 hard drive or does USB2 not support smart?
[03:00] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Thanks for all the help/info
[03:00] <JackHanna> ok damn it.. someone has to have info on lcd lid switch problems.. but none of them seem to come up for me in a search
[03:00] <sethk> emacsen, if it's specific to only a part of the system, like maybe sound or graphics, there are probably specific sources.
[03:01] <jrib> shane2peru: you know what we could try, we could delete the theme that got installed in ~/.themes for your old user an GNOME will probably revert to a sensible alternative
[03:01] <sethk> emacsen, if it's more general, then you'll want a more general source.
[03:01] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: no problem, the O'Reilly Postfix book is good too
[03:01] <britt> NoStop: i dont think smart works with usb2
[03:01] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: It's super pointing me in the right way, sorry for my bad English
[03:01] <britt> its a controller thing, not a usb thing
[03:01] <shane2peru> ok, let me take a look at that.
[03:01] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: your english is fine, I was born speaking it and I have no excuse for mine
[03:01] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: haha :)
[03:01] <jrib> shane2peru: was this a metacity theme or gtk?
[03:02] <emacsen> sethk: well I bought a laptop and from what I read, expected it to work, and instead neither initial pre-X display is working, and X doesn't work at all either
[03:02] <NoStop> britt: thanks. that was what I suspected but hoped (against hope I guess) that maybe it could work :-)
[03:02] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: the only Swedish I speak is Vodka
[03:02] <emacsen> sethk: the Grub menu works :)
[03:02] <britt> NoStop: why do you need smart?
[03:02] <shane2peru> jrib:  I'm not sure.  I got it from gnome-look.org it was the ubuntu-Azul (blue)
[03:02] <shira> Hi, I just reinstalled grub after a failed WinXP install, and now when I boot, GDM doesn't load. When I do startx, gnome loads but I don't have any fonts loaded, they're all boxes. Any idea why?.. or should I just do a reinstall?
[03:02] <sethk> emacsen, that's somewhat unusual, many laptops work without a problem (I have several).  what laptop?
[03:02] <emacsen> Dell Latitude 620
[03:02] <emacsen> and people on the forum say "Yeah no problem"
[03:02] <sethk> emacsen, to get the thing installed, you use the text mode install from the alternate cd
[03:03] <emacsen> but I have the NVidia video card not Intel
[03:03] <NoStop> britt: built a NAS server and it would be nice to be able to monitor drives and drive temps remotely. but all the drives are plugin USB2 running with ext enclosures
[03:03] <sethk> emacsen, I never say "no problem" about any dell.
[03:03] <shane2peru> jrib:  Why don't I copy the themes from this user over to that user, and that should fix it.
[03:03] <sethk> emacsen, that's ok, I have a laptop with nvidia and I don't really have problems with it.
[03:03] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: haha and when you're done with vodka you drive home in your Volvo and when your home in your IKEA decorated home?
[03:03] <shane2peru> without leaving nothin there.
[03:03] <emacsen> sethk: yeah but I'd still have to get X working later, rght?
[03:03] <sethk> emacsen, but the installer works with a much smaller subset of graphics hardware than the full system.
[03:03] <jrib> shane2peru: well this user probably has nothing.  Just rename .themes to .themes.backup for your old user
[03:03] <shane2peru> ok
[03:03] <nn> ikea is terrible
[03:03] <sethk> emacsen, yes, you'll have to get X going, but it shouldn't be difficult.
[03:03] <emacsen> sethk: really? that's interesting. I didn't realize that
[03:03] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: I toured with a band from Sweden so I do know that Ikea means 'lame' over there ;-)
[03:04] <JPAULEY> Anyone get xe-emulator to install in ubuntu?
[03:04] <sethk> nn, ikea has some things that are good and cheap.
[03:04] <shane2peru> jrib: actually .themes is a folder, does that matter?
[03:04] <emacsen> sethk: how about the pre-X display, the screen that shows during init...
[03:04] <emacsen> sethk: even that is bad on my system
[03:04] <Poromenos1> my crontab doesn't fire, any idea how i can check if the command gets launched?
[03:04] <jrib> shane2peru: .themes is the directory where all of your installed themes go, you can safely rename it
[03:04] <sethk> emacsen, that's usually easy to work around, by adding to the kernel command line    vga=ask
[03:04] <shane2peru> ok
[03:04] <sethk> emacsen, in the menu.lst file, which is the grub configuration file.  Or you can edit the kernel command line at the grub prompt
[03:05] <emacsen> sethk: okay. See, all this laptop stuff is beyond me. all I know are servers :)
[03:05] <emacsen> sethk: yeah I know about grub... All this "video" is all so new :)
[03:05] <Nimismo> i have installed ubuntu 6.06 on this machine as a dual boot and now when I choose to boot XP in GRUB; XP wont load it just reposts my machine and sends me in an eternal loop, anyone have an idea of what I can do?
[03:05] <sethk> emacsen, the way the laptop is constructed, you've got a graphics adapter on a PCI bus.  Looks, to the o/s, exactly like a workstation with a separate graphics card.
[03:05] <shane2peru> jrib:  What is the command for rename?  I don't remember.
[03:05] <emacsen> sethk: heh, ok
[03:05] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: I did a tour with a band called Komeda, ever hear of them?
[03:05] <jrib> shane2peru: mv
[03:05] <emacsen> sethk: I'll try your advice. thanks
[03:06] <shane2peru> right thanks.
[03:06] <sethk> emacsen, nvidia is a bit of a special case, because the drivers for nvidia aren't open source, so they are downloaded separately
[03:06] <caffiendo> I want to stream mounted Iso's of DVD's across my LAN.  Is there a something like GNUMP3d that does video?
[03:06] <emacsen> sethk: yeah I know, they're evil
[03:06] <sethk> emacsen, there is an open source nvidia driver, which is fine, but doesn't do 3d.
[03:06] <sn9> caffiendo: vlc
[03:06] <sethk> emacsen, it means that nvidia support, in the installer itself, is a bit limited
[03:06] <caffiendo> vlc?
[03:06] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: No I'm sorry, you traveled around in Sweden?
[03:06] <johnny__> ello all
[03:06] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: nope, they were here in the US
[03:06] <sethk> emacsen, but I've found that running the install program from nvidia's web site works very well.
[03:06] <jrib> shane2peru: /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme and /apps/metacity/general/theme are the relevant gconf settings by the way
[03:07] <confusco> what's the best email client?
[03:07] <Kingsqueak> mutt
[03:07] <LjL> !best
[03:07] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[03:07] <sethk> confusco, depends on your requirements.
[03:07] <caffiendo> vidoelan..  thanks
[03:07] <sethk> confusco, there are, literally, dozens of them.
[03:07] <matiu> shane2peru, is this you? http://www.missionarytalks.com/2006/11/11/episode-03-shane-rice/
[03:08] <sethk> confusco, you want fancy?  basic?  command line?  integrated with other stuff, or stand alone?
[03:08] <shane2peru> Hey, that is me :)
[03:08] <johnny__> would it be ok to resize my ext3 ubuntu partition to be smaller? If i resize it would files or my ubuntu system become corrupted?
[03:08] <brendan__> hi, does anyone know if the the ubuntu developers had to patch gnome and kde to use the /.hidden file?
[03:08] <shane2peru> I stick to the same name on forums too.
[03:08] <jrib> brendan__: no idea, but what does /.hidden do?
[03:08] <sethk> johnny__, always back up before resizing _any_ partition in _any_ o/s.  theoretically, it will be ok (gparted is popular for doing that)
[03:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell jrib about hidden | jrib, you have a private message from Ubotu
[03:08] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Aaa i see, where they any good? Where you in a band traveling with them or?
[03:09] <johnny__> yea thats what i always use is gparted
[03:09] <majikman> a
[03:09] <johnny__> um how do i backup partitions?
[03:09] <sn9> johnny__: gparted will not do ext3
[03:09] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell johnny__ about backup | johnny__, you have a private message from Ubotu
[03:09] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: I was tour manager and soundman for a band called Ivy, Komeda toured with us for a few months here...back in '96 or so I think
[03:09] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Aaa fround them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komeda
[03:09] <jrib> LjL: do you know if this is kde-only or is there just not a wiki page for gnome?
[03:09] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: they are very unusual music, good people too
[03:09] <johnny__> what do you mean gparted will not resize ext3? why?
[03:10] <LjL> jrib: AFAIK it's used in Kubuntu and not in Ubuntu by default, but Ubuntu (i.e. Gnome) also supports it, and if you install kubuntu-desktop on an Ubuntu installation, you'll get your files hidden even in Gnome
[03:10] <jrib> LjL: I see, thanks for the info
[03:10] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Cool, sounds like fun
[03:10] <sn9> that's right. it does not support resizing ext2/3
[03:10] <brendan__> jrib, /.hidden tools konqueor and the gtk open dialogs to hide most of the system folder in /
[03:11] <sethk> the files really aren't hidden in any way.  it's just a convention that they are left out of an ls listing without using the -a or -A flag.
[03:11] <johnny__> ic
[03:11] <johnny__> hmm
[03:11] <johnny__> what should i use to resize??
[03:11] <shane2peru> jrib: Ok, this mv stuff doesn't seem to be working.
[03:11] <LjL> sethk, that's dot files, but that's not what we're talking about
[03:11] <jrib> shane2peru: did you do 'sudo mv ~olduser/.themes ~olduser/.themes.backup'?
[03:11] <sethk> LjL, oh, I thought you were talking about .hidden
[03:12] <sn9> johnny__: there is a command-line tool to resize ext2/3 filesystems, but it does not touch partition sizes
[03:12] <majikman> so.... who banned me last night?
[03:12] <shane2peru> Actually I'm in the directory and did a sudo su before
[03:12] <LjL> sethk: yeah, we're talking about the file "/.hidden" (which, itself, is a dot file, but that's not the point)
[03:12] <LjL> !hidden | sethk
[03:12] <ubotu> sethk: Kubuntu Edgy has implemented a new feature that hides most of the filesystem. For more information: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuHiddenFiles
[03:12] <shane2peru> then did mv .themes/    .themes.old/
[03:12] <sethk> LjL, I've seen that, I don't quite go along with that explanation ...
[03:12] <jrib> shane2peru: k, what happened afterwards?
[03:12] <johnny__> so I would be better of just deleting my partitions and make new ones and reinstall ubuntu
[03:12] <shane2peru> nothing
[03:13] <shane2peru> when I ls -a it is not there.
[03:13] <sn9> johnny__: it's a tradeoff
[03:13] <DualCortex> Hey guys, I got a problem with Eclipse not loading. It shouldn't be something hard to answer, anyway here's a link to my thread with all the info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304443
[03:13] <sethk> johnny__, if you can back up the files, you can make a new partition and copy the files back to the new partition
[03:13] <sethk> johnny__, that works with linux, even if it is a boot partition.
[03:13] <jrib> shane2peru: what does 'file ~olduser/.themes' say now?
[03:13] <sethk> DualCortex, maybe java in fact is not installed?
[03:13] <shane2peru> it is the same.
[03:14] <johnny__> well the thing is that i want to do is. Make my ubuntu partition smaller so i can make a new partition for my music,pics ect
[03:14] <LjL> sethk basically /.hidden is a plaintext list of files/directories (well, normally directories) that should not be shown in GUI file browsers. by default, in Kubuntu, the only two directories that are *not* listed there are /media and /home
[03:14] <emacsen> sethk: is the text installer on the desktop CD?
[03:14] <shane2peru> jrib:  I even checked inside the directory, and it still showed the same file.
[03:14] <DualCortex> it is installed correctly, etc. Seems like you didn't check out the thread :)
[03:14] <sethk> LjL, yes, I know, but it's a file browser feature, not really an o/s feature, and not specific to ubuntu in any way either.
[03:14] <sethk> emacsen, no, on the alternate cd
[03:14] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Hmm i think i got sasl working or on the way to, thanks. Do you know anything about vmware? Getting poor performance running vmware server
[03:14] <emacsen> sethk: suck. oh well
[03:14] <jrib> shane2peru: pastebin the commands and ouput
[03:15] <shane2peru> jrib:  ok
[03:15] <sn9> has anybody here upgraded breezy to dapper on powerpc?
[03:15] <Kingsqueak> nanomike: nope, haven't used vmware in about six years
[03:15] <LjL> sethk: whether it's Ubuntu-specific or not, i didn't know, but i do know that it's not used by default in Dapper or in Ubuntu Edgy, while it's used in Kubuntu Edgy
[03:15] <shane2peru> jrib:  shane2@shane-laptop:/home/shane$ mv  .themes .themes.backup
[03:15] <shane2peru> mv: cannot move `.themes' to `.themes.backup': Permission denied
[03:15] <shane2peru> shane2@shane-laptop:/home/shane$ sudo mv .themes .themes.backup
[03:15] <shane2peru> shane2@shane-laptop:/home/shane$ ls
[03:15] <NewpZ> if i close the lid to my laptop then reopen it, it freezes the system.. does this happen to anyone else?
[03:15] <sethk> LjL, it's straight kde
[03:15] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell shane2peru about paste | shane2peru, you have a private message from Ubotu
[03:16] <LjL> sethk: well, and straight Gnome as well it appears, since Gnome dialogs (and i suppose Nautilus) respect that too
[03:16] <nn> NewpZ: That's an APM issue
[03:16] <shane2peru> sorry, I'm new to this thing.
[03:16] <jrib> shane2peru: pastebin 'ls -a'
[03:16] <sethk> LjL, hmm, I'll have to look at that.
[03:16] <NewpZ> never happend in breezy
[03:16] <shane2peru> just paste it here?
[03:16] <sethk> jrib, you'll want -la probably
[03:16] <sethk> NewpZ, there are some glitches in the power save features.
[03:17] <jrib> shane2peru: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org , then give us the link
[03:17] <sethk> NewpZ, you'll find postings of many similar things.
[03:17] <sn9> NewpZ: try the kernel arg "acpi=force"
[03:17] <NewpZ> sethk,  is there a work around?
[03:17] <NewpZ> k
[03:17] <DualCortex> Hey guys, I got a problem with Eclipse not loading. It shouldn't be something hard to answer, anyway here's a link to my thread with all the info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304443
[03:17] <sethk> NewpZ, try sn9's suggestion
[03:17] <sethk> NewpZ, there are other similar configuration things you can try.  sometimes they help, but not always.
[03:18] <sethk> DualCortex, did you answer my question about whether you are sure java is installed?
[03:18] <NewpZ> i just disabled it all in the gnome power mngt
[03:18] <sethk> NewpZ, you have to disable it on the kernel command line for it to really "take"
[03:18] <shane2peru> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33188/
[03:19] <NewpZ> im hitting the close lid button .. hit it about 100 time now.. still everything is ok. so i guess thats an ok fix
[03:19] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: 'eclipse' is probably a script that sets $JAVA_HOME to the wrong spot
[03:19] <sethk> NewpZ, if it works, I won't argue.  :)
[03:19] <DualCortex> sethk: Yes I did..sorry forgot to put your name. It's correctly installed and  /usr/lib/eclipse/eclipse loads up Eclipse fine.
[03:19] <NewpZ> acpi + linux = bad
[03:19] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: if you look at 'which eclipse' see if it's a script and set JAVA_HOME to where you installed 1.5
[03:19] <NewpZ> i wish they would focus more on laptop support
[03:20] <sethk> DualCortex, check Kingsqueak's suggest.  to  "which eclipse"  to see if it's really running a script or an alias.
[03:20] <K^Holtz> i just upgraded to edgy and it says i'm still on dapper... help plz
[03:20] <sethk> dort, not to
[03:20] <shane2peru> jrib: oops, sorry that was not the right one.
[03:20] <sn9> NewpZ: acpi still usually beats apm
[03:20] <sethk> can't type.
[03:20] <DualCortex> KIngsqueak, what's "which eclipse"   :P
[03:20] <K^Holtz> i ran sudo aptitude update and  sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
[03:20] <coz_> K^Holtz, did you upgrade or clean install
[03:20] <nanomike> Kingsqueak: Np, It's pretty cool and free now. Thanks for everything, gonna continue configure mail/www server :) Here have some vodka
[03:20] <sethk> DualCortex, I meant to say   run "which eclipse"
[03:20] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, what's "which eclipse"   :P
[03:20] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: you tell me, it will tell you where 'eclipse' is
[03:20] <K^Holtz> coz_: ^^
[03:20] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: according to your PATH
[03:21] <NewpZ> acpi || apm still is no good in linux.. very few laptops / desktops works with them
[03:21] <NewpZ> suspend is a joke
[03:21] <shane2peru> jrib:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33189/  here it is
[03:21] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, oh ok, didn't know it was a command. Here's the output:  /usr/lib/eclipse/eclipse
[03:21] <IndyGUnFreak> how do i register my nickname on Xchat and freenode?
[03:21] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: now do 'file /usr/lib/eclipse/eclipse'

[03:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about register : IndyGUnFreak - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:21] <coz_> K^Holtz, you upgraded well... that may be the problem... what you mihgt consider... later... is a clean install ... overwriting what you have on the drive
[03:21] <tonyyarusso> !register | IndyGUnFreak
[03:21] <ubotu> IndyGUnFreak: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration

[03:21] <sethk> IndyGUnFreak, it's on their web page
[03:21] <tonyyarusso> It helps if I get my syntax right
[03:22] <IndyGUnFreak> sorry, never found the webpage.

[03:22] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, output pastebin'ed
[03:22] <Poromenos1> my cron isn't running, any ideas?
[03:23] <shane2peru> jrib:  ok
[03:23] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: link?
[03:23] <DualCortex> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33190/
[03:23] <sethk> Poromenos1, is it not running when you start up?  is it dying?  what happens if you start it manually?
[03:23] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33190/
[03:23] <sn9> K^Holtz: did you change your sources.list?
[03:23] <K^Holtz> sn9: not before i upgraded
[03:24] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: k, odd that's a binary file, I'm not sure why invoking it with full path works and without doesn't
[03:24] <Poromenos1> sethk: the daemon seems to be running, but my crontab isn't being activated
[03:24] <sn9> K^Holtz: then you didn't upgrade
[03:24] <sethk> Poromenos1, did you restart cron after modifying crontab?
[03:24] <shane2peru> jrib:  ok did it again here is the output:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33191/
[03:24] <K^Holtz> sn9: ahh.. ic
[03:24] <ashika> ls
[03:24] <ashika> :)
[03:24] <K^Holtz> sn9: plz point me to the sources file and what to change
[03:24] <ashika> Hallo
[03:24] <Poromenos1> sethk: do i need to? :(
[03:24] <ashika> Anyone need help
[03:25] <jrib> shane2peru: lol this troubles me... one sec
[03:25] <lastnode> on dapper, my max resolution is 1024x768, i have a radeon 200m xpress. any ideas? (when i set to 1200x768 the screen goes all funny and overlaps when drawing)
[03:25] <sethk> Poromenos1, yes.  you can send it a signal, but restart is simpler as you can use the script in /etc/init.d
[03:25] <shane2peru> jrib:  ok.
[03:25] <sn9> K^Holtz: it's in /etc/apt, and change all the "dapper" to "edgy"
[03:25] <Poromenos1> sethk: i didn't know that, thanks... let's see if it works now
[03:25] <ashika> lastnode try editing for xorg.conf and restart.
[03:25] <lastnode> ashika, what do i need to change?
[03:26] <jrib> shane2peru: does 'sudo echo hi' work?
[03:26] <ashika> lastnode, Wait why are you change to 1200x786 when your max is 1024x768
[03:26] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, brb, going to relogin using xchat (currently on chatzilla)
[03:26] <Poromenos1> sethk: still nothing, sadly
[03:26] <Kingsqueak> k
[03:26] <sethk> Poromenos1, check the logs
[03:26] <shane2peru> jrib:  I tried "sudo echo hi"  and nothing happened.
[03:26] <Poromenos1> sethk: which one?
[03:26] <lastnode> ashika, my max is not 1204x768. in windows i get 1200x
[03:26] <ashika> lastnode, Ahh
[03:26] <shane2peru> maybe the account I created doesn' t have sudo permissions?
[03:26] <sethk> Poromenos1, look at /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages
[03:26] <jrib> shane2peru: ah we didn't add your user to the "admin" group, so he can't sudo.  ok this command will switch you to shane:  su - shane
[03:27] <ashika> lastnode, Do you single or dual boot
[03:27] <sethk> Poromenos1, just to be thorough, you are editing with the crontab utility?
[03:27] <K^Holtz> sn9: i just opened this in gedit, and its not giving me the option to save
[03:27] <sethk> Poromenos1, and when you edit the file again, you see the changes?
[03:27] <Poromenos1> sethk: crontab -e, yes
[03:27] <Poromenos1> and yes
[03:27] <Poromenos1> Nov 22 04:26:12 ubuserver /usr/sbin/cron[12867] : (CRON) INFO (Skipping @reboot jobs -- not system startup)
[03:27] <sn9> K^Holtz: yeah, you need to use sudo
[03:27] <caffiendo> is there anything that will stream .VOB files to windows media player?

[03:27] <DualCortex> kingsqueak, I'm back
[03:28] <Poromenos1> sethk: ah, it apparently works now
[03:28] <Poromenos1> great, thanks a lot :)
[03:28] <sethk> Poromenos1, good, it should  :)
[03:28] <shane2peru> jrib:  Ok, that did it!
[03:28] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: yeah not sure what your issue is, it's weird, I would just say to invoke it with the full path since it works
[03:28] <Poromenos1> sethk: erm, how do i stop the task i started? :p
[03:28] <shane2peru> let me log into that account and see if it works.
[03:28] <sethk> Poromenos1, unplug the machine?   You can use kill, or killall, as with any other running command
[03:28] <Skwid_> beryl
[03:28] <DualCortex> ok then, thanks anyway. I'll wait to see if anyone on the forums has any ideas
[03:28] <Poromenos1> sethk: ah, okay, thanks
[03:29] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: why not just run it with the full path?
[03:29] <ashika> lastnode, Are you there?
[03:29] <sn9> caffiendo: i believe it's still possible, though cumbersome, to accomplish that with vlc
[03:29] <lastnode> ashika, i triple boot, ubuntu, debian xp
[03:29] <Zambezi> I can't find libcurl 7.12.x in the repos. Does it have another name?
[03:29] <ashika> lastnode, DO you want to set resolution via grub or xorg.conf
[03:30] <lastnode> ashika, i dont mind either
[03:30] <DualCortex> Kingsqueak, yeah I will... sometimes just bothers me to have such simple bugs
[03:30] <jrib> Zambezi: do you need that exact version?  edgy seems to have 7.15.4
[03:30] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: it's not you though I think it's the bin for Eclipse is doing something odd with paths
[03:30] <ashika> lastnode, first try this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[03:30] <coz_> Zajjko, just type in libcurl into synaptic
[03:30] <ashika> lastnode, If that doesn't work let me know
[03:30] <mbrown> How do you make gnome-terminal do what xterm does with -hold ???
[03:30] <Zambezi> jrib, I use Dapper.
[03:30] <Kingsqueak> DualCortex: you could run 'strace eclipse' and 'strace /path/to/eclipse' and see if there is anything interesting there
[03:31] <sn9> anybody: after a breezy-to-dapper upgrade, firefox does a SIGILL. any ideas?
[03:31] <jrib> Zambezi: dapper has 7.15.1

[03:32] <mournsanity> Can anyone tell me where I can find the source code for the wanda fish applet?
[03:32] <Kingsqueak> sn9: hmm not sure then, as a workaround have you just tried downloading it, installing in ~/ and running it as ~/firefox/firefox  ?
[03:33] <Zambezi> coz_, Can I paste it in PM? I'm not sure what is it?
[03:33] <sn9> that i haven't
[03:33] <lastnode> ashika, doesnt work
[03:33] <Kingsqueak> sn9: if you do an apt-get update and upgrade are there any held back packages or other warnings?

[03:34] <shane2peru> jrib:  Ok, that got me in with the following errors.
[03:34] <bashir> hey
[03:34] <Kingsqueak> sn9: odd, really not sure
[03:34] <bashir> how do i know if my graphics card driver is working correctly?
[03:34] <Tony_> ub3r n00b here.  I need some help, ok a lot of help, with madwifi and 6.10
[03:34] <shane2peru> OAFIID:Gnome_Panel_multiload_applet couldn't load to the gnome panel
[03:34] <Kingsqueak> sn9: if you start 'firefox' from a term does it give you any more useful info as to why it dies?
[03:35] <shane2peru> and a few others, I could choose not to delete it or delete it from the panel, I chose not to.
[03:35] <sn9> Kingsqueak: yeah, that's how i found out it's a SIGILL
[03:35] <shane2peru> No programs would open up.
[03:35] <shane2peru> However I could see my panel :)
=== LGKeiz[LoLDemosD is now known as LGKeiz
[03:35] <jrib> shane2peru: can you change your theme?
[03:35] <Tony_> I dont know where to begin, but i dont think my wireless card is being recognized
[03:35] <mbrown> Kingsqueak - what I want is to execute `gnome-terminal --command=batchfile` but have the terminal stay open.. xterm does that, but what xterm doesn't do is casuing problems too... (trying to make my wife a batchscript that runs in a terminal and stays active so she can follow the directions...)
[03:35] <Kingsqueak> sn9: I'd try downloading it and just run it out of your homedir next
[03:36] <shane2peru> Didn't try, I couldn't get xchat to open
[03:36] <shane2peru> or Firefox.
[03:36] <phxheat> hi, im running automatix but it seems to have stalled on the step after completing real player installation... what should i do?
[03:36] <LjL> !automatix
[03:36] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: hmm k, what doesn't xterm do that you'd like, that might be easier to answer
[03:36] <sn9> Kingsqueak: ok. got url for a binary of 1.5 for linux-powerpc?
[03:36] <LjL> phxheat: ask in #automatix or stop the installation if you can (guess not)
[03:37] <Tony_> anyone think they can help me?
[03:37] <Jordan_U> Tony_:  What's the problem?
[03:37] <epp> hey
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> sn9: doh, sorry, no
[03:37] <Tony_> madwifi driver not working
[03:37] <mbrown> Kingsqueak - well, basically, I want a button on her menubar called "internet down" that when clicked walks her through ifdown/ifup, powercycle router, powercycle modem, that type of thing... gnome-terminal lets you open a new terminal from the menubar, xterm doesn't seem to have a menubar option?!?
[03:38] <shane2peru> jrib:  Ok, tried to log back in, and same crash, no response. let me run through the steps again, and try to change the theme.
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: ahh
[03:38] <phxheat> LjL: how would i forciby quit the program? (I can't close it)... should i use kill?
[03:38] <jrib> shane2peru: ok, do this,    xhost +local:     then,    su - shane    then    gconf-editor
[03:38] <Tony_> Jordan_U:  I wish I could tell you more, but i dont know where to begin
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: know that drill well ;-)
[03:38] <IndyGUnFreak> One more question, how do I set Firefox to be my default browser under X?  for some reason, it opens in either Konq or if I right click, I can choose Opera.  Firefox is set to be my default browser under the OS.
[03:39] <LjL> phxheat: i don't know. ask in #automatix
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: how about a text file on the desktop she can click, set it chattr +i to keep her from deleting it
[03:39] <NoStop> Kingsqueak: why don't you just setup a launch application ... pointed at your BASH script and run in a terminal?
[03:39] <phxheat> LjL: no one is responding there unfortunately
[03:39] <nomasteryoda> ah, the challenge ... Ubuntu minty installed today on a Dumpster d'ove IDE drive - external (as in no case only usb wire and powersupply) Using this setup rig to Installl Ubuntu onto an emachine with ati graphics card and only 208mb ram
[03:39] <J-_> what do I need to get IE running in wine on ubuntu? any specific packages?
[03:39] <LjL> phxheat: did you mention that you were in #ubuntu...?
[03:39] <LjL> phxheat, anyway, i suggest reinstalling without automatix
[03:40] <sn9> J-_: google "ies4linux"
[03:40] <jrib> shane2peru: argh, I missed a step, do    export DISPLAY=:0    before running gconf-editor
[03:40] <mbrown> Kingsqueak - lol... well what xterm DOES do, is lets me `xterm -e batchfile -hold`, but she has no terminal to work in yet.. adds more steps for someone whois technophobic...  ahhh hey that's a good idea, with the textfile and all, thanks!
[03:40] <J-_> k
[03:40] <J-_> htanks sn9
[03:40] <freemind> yeah sn9
[03:40] <freemind> that rawks
[03:40] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: or an html file, set her a bookmark for file:///path/to/instructions.html
[03:40] <mbrown> Kingsqueak - great ideas, thanks bro!
[03:40] <Tony_> anyone here familiar with the madwifi driver?
[03:40] <shane2peru> jrib:  I get an error = GTK-Warning cannot open display
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> mbrown: no problem, my wife runs Ubuntu all day now, with no trouble, hell she's better at troubleshooting now than some co-workers
[03:41] <cheesy> i do have trouble with dual boot (linux & win2k)...what can i do if windows doesnt boot anymore?
[03:41] <confusco> "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning: "I can't configure Debian.
[03:41] <mbrown> lol, rock on, thanks again!
[03:41] <jrib> shane2peru: what did it say after you did 'xhost +local:'?
[03:41] <shane2peru> jrib: ok, it opened a configuration editor.
[03:42] <shane2peru> Jrib: non-network local connections being added to access control list
[03:42] <Kingsqueak> confusco: Ubuntu is an African word for "I got tired of the apps I had in 1998"
[03:42] <jrib> shane2peru: /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme and /apps/metacity/general/theme
[03:42] <jrib> shane2peru: run gconf-editor as shane2 and set the same values for those keys
[03:42] <cheesy> after installing ubuntu windows won't start anymore. what can i do?
[03:42] <confusco> heh
[03:42] <IndyGUnFreak> its a sign cheesy, thats how linux is designed..lol
[03:42] <Tony_> cheesy: what do you mean "wont start?" does it not appear on the boot menu?
[03:43] <slavik> cheesy: what exactly do you mean? you should be able to select windows from the Grub menu ...
[03:43] <cheesy> it appears in the menu but i get a blue screen if i wan't to boot
[03:43] <Kingsqueak> cheesy: did you *just* finish the install?
[03:43] <cheesy> Kingsqueak: what do you mean by that?
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> cheesy: if you resized the partition, you should let Win sit for a good long while, it gets a bit confused over the filesystem and requires a slow check that it should do for you
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> cheesy: the lovely part is, it doesn't show you anything, it just does it
[03:44] <GenNMX> Hi, the people on #ubuntu on EFNet are talking about molesting sheep. Anyway, my ethernet card doesn't work anymore after reinstalling xserver-xorg and x11-common, probably because it hates me. Should I shoot it?
[03:44] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[03:44] <Jordan_U> Tony_: Don't know much about wifi but I would try installing restricted modules to see if your card just needs some firmware
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> cheesy: fire it up, and leave it sit there for a good 15mins before you give up on it, it can take a while
[03:45] <Tony_> restricted is already installed
[03:45] <cheesy> Kingsqueak:  that would be nice..it shows me a blue screen saying that the boot thing is fucked up
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> the boot thing?
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> cheesy: it didn't say it was repairing it or give an option?
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> insert windows disk
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> do a repair install.
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> runt he commands FIXMBR
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> FIXBOOT
[03:45] <cheesy> ok
[03:45] <IndyGUnFreak> Grub will be erased.
[03:46] <Jordan_U> !madwifi | Tony_ maybe?
[03:46] <ubotu> Tony_ maybe?: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:46] <cheesy> and how do i get grub back?
[03:46] <Jordan_U> !grub | cheesy
[03:46] <ubotu> cheesy: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[03:46] <shane2peru> Jrib:  Ok, it was set to Glider in the non-working one, and Human in the new one.
[03:46] <Tony_> Jordan_U, thanks, i'll read through it
[03:46] <IndyGUnFreak> you'll have to reinstall it, there's a couple live CD's you can use to just install Grub
[03:46] <shane2peru> jrib:  now try to log in?
[03:46] <IndyGUnFreak> I had that problem so many times with Fedora Core 5, I lost count
[03:47] <jrib> shane2peru: k, remember there are two keys, one for emtacity and one for gtk
[03:47] <shane2peru> right
[03:47] <jrib> shane2peru: yep, go ahead and try
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> I wonder if I can fix my XP media install that way
[03:47] <IndyGUnFreak> King, probably, but like i sai,d you'll hose grub.
[03:47] <shane2peru> jrib:  is that what broke it?  installing a metacity theme into a GTK theme or visa versa?
[03:47] <IndyGUnFreak> so make sure you have an understanding how to reinstall it.
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> that's no big deal, I hadn't thought to try that
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> yeah I'm good with that
[03:47] <fluxd> hello can anyone tell me what driver name I am supposed to put in xorg.conf file for an ati mobility radeon x1600?
[03:48] <jrib> shane2peru: nah, you just install a theme and it does the right thing on its own
[03:48] <noodles12> !ati
[03:48] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:48] <shane2peru> jrib:  ok, going to give this a try.
[03:48] <slavik> fluxd: the binary ati driver
[03:48] <cheesy> i just get back to the blue screen and tell you what it says before i try that
[03:48] <Jordan_U> noodles12: He might not need the binary drivers
[03:48] <fluxd> slavik: is it "ati" ?
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> IndyGUnFreak: any clue if FreeDOS or anything can do that repair for XP ?
[03:48] <slavik> fluxd: no, fglrx
[03:48] <IndyGUnFreak> hmm King.. not to sure.
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> IndyGUnFreak: HP doesn't ship media with Pavillions
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> k
[03:49] <Jordan_U> fluxd: Try sti , if that doesn't work follow the instructions ubotu gave you for fglrx.
[03:49] <Jordan_U> fluxd: *ati
[03:49] <slavik> ati is the open source driver and will not give 3d accelaration on any X series ...
[03:49] <fluxd> thx Jordan_U slavik
[03:49] <IndyGUnFreak> oh, well, i can't help you there, i build my own... so i always have a Xp disk handy
[03:49] <Jordan_U> slavik: Didn't know that :)
[03:49] <North64> I suppose ubuntu is very network dependant during the first install? (one CD, vs. DVD size of other distros)
[03:49] <IndyGUnFreak> I would think FreeDos has those commands, they are pretty old Dos commands.
[03:49] <Duck_> what would be the best VNC program to use on Windows to connect to my Linux box?
[03:50] <Kingsqueak> IndyGUnFreak: just wonder if it does NTFS
[03:50] <shane2peru> jrib:  Thanks!  I back in, and seems to be working correctly, My panel needs a little re-arranging, but at least it works!
[03:50] <Jordan_U> North64: Nope, everything is on the CD.
[03:50] <jrib> shane2peru: great
[03:50] <IndyGUnFreak> i'm not sure Kings...
[03:50] <sn9> Duck_: i used tightvnc for that
[03:50] <shane2peru> jrib:  My clock is gone though.  I will att a new one.
[03:50] <shane2peru> add
[03:50] <jrib> shane2peru: don't be scared to try other themes, that's the first time I've seen that happen
[03:50] <ivx> hey if you have high speed and a phone line is there anyway to make it so you can setup a dial up internet account
[03:50] <Duck_> sn9: is it any faster than RealVNC?
[03:50] <will__> Hi all
[03:50] <sn9> vnc can never be really fast
[03:51] <Skwid_> is there a well integrated way to rotate wallpapers from a folder / flickr ?
[03:51] <Skwid_> in gnome ?
[03:51] <North64> Jordan_U: well, then there must be stuff missing?  I mean others don't distribute their stuff on 6 CDs or a DVD for nothing
[03:51] <Pelo> ivx,  why would you want to ?
[03:51] <tbtrojanek> Is there an easy way to revert my system to a base Ubuntu Desktop install?(Without a CD)
[03:51] <shane2peru> jrib:  I upgraded to Edgy, then downgraded to Dapper, and left my /home directory
[03:51] <jrib> Skwid_: there is wallpapoz but I wouldn't say it is well integrated
[03:51] <shane2peru> could that be a problem?
[03:51] <ivx> pelo, when i go to visit my mom i want to use the internet but not have ot pay for dial up
[03:51] <tbtrojanek> A have an Ubuntu 6.10 install right now, with a lot of crap on it, and would like it basically a fresh install.
[03:51] <Jordan_U> North64: It has most of the things a basic Desktop user would need, you install the rest on your own.
[03:51] <jrib> Skwid_: wallpaper-tray is in the repos, but I have not tried it
[03:52] <Skwid_> ok, ill look
[03:52] <jrib> Skwid_: probably
[03:52] <jrib> shane2peru: probably
[03:52] <North64> Jordan_U: thanks, will try it out, nothing like loading a new distro ;)
[03:52] <tbtrojanek> Is there an easy way to revert my system to a base Ubuntu Desktop install?(Without a CD)

[03:52] <will__> I have an audio question. Which audio decoder do I need to hear mp3 audio?

[03:53] <matiu> shane2peru, Create a new user account, then copy their emptyish home dir ontop of yours
[03:53] <DjViper> will__: get easy ubuntu

[03:53] <Plecebo> i'm having trouble mounting my dvd drive, is there anyone that can help me troubleshoot?
[03:53] <Pelo> ivx,   let me see if I get this straight,   for regular use you want dial-up and for when you visit your mom you want  high speed ?
[03:53] <shane2peru> matiu:  Thanks!  I already have a new user.
[03:53] <Jordan_U> tbtrojanek: You could get most of it back to default by running: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a -phigh
[03:54] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[03:54] <Pelo> Plecebo,  you need to have a dvd in the drive for it to mount
[03:54] <shane2peru> jrib:  yeah but if I'm going to continue to run into problems with things, that may be the best way, or what matiu says.
[03:54] <ivx> pelo, i have high speed now, but when i am not home i want to be able to call my house to use dial up
[03:54] <Pelo> hello KnowledgEngi
[03:54] <tbtrojanek> Jordan_U: It's not that I uninstalled stuff, but have a bunch of excess crap installed.
[03:54] <IndyGUnFreak> will, you need to download the mp3 codecs
[03:54] <confusco> well, ivx, i think you could do that, but is it in the same area code?
[03:54] <IndyGUnFreak> are you using 6.06 or 6.10?
[03:54] <shane2peru> I will start developing my new user that I added, and won't try any new themes or changes with this user.
[03:54] <Pelo> ivx,  that's over my head , sorry
[03:55] <Plecebo> Pelo, have tried several dvd's, the icon appears on the desktop but i can not find any information on the disk, both dvd's have information on them
[03:55] <ivx> confusco, yes thanks to voip
[03:55] <shane2peru> jrib: Thanks for the help!
[03:55] <malt> what is the best and cheapeast place to get a domain, thats not godaddy or yahoo and that lets you pay by paypal or visa debit card
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> tbtrojanek: it would be easier to leave it installed fwiw, or just fire up synaptic and start selecting things to remove, but that can open a can of worms
[03:55] <IndyGUnFreak> Will, if you're not emotionally attatched to whatever media player you're using, got o the repos, and install XMMS.. it plays MP3's without installing any additional codecs
[03:55] <ivx> malt why not godaddy.com?
[03:55] <North64> what's wrong with godaddy?
[03:55] <gnuvince> How can I "reinitialize" my sound in edgy eft?
[03:55] <will__> DjViper, : I'm sorry. EASY Ubuntu?
[03:55] <ivx> yeah right!
[03:55] <Pelo> Plecebo,   I can tell you that dvd /cds mount in the /media/  folder , that's about it ,  you can try mounting them there
[03:55] <confusco> you might not get a good connection with voip.
[03:55] <Plecebo> Pelo, cd's work, but dvd's get no love
[03:55] <jrib> shane2peru: np
[03:55] <netcatc> hello all
[03:56] <will__> wow this chan is huge.
[03:56] <ivx> malt if you want to run you own apache server, they let you use there dns and modify the a record, so that will save you
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> tbtrojanek: easiest way is probably just back up your home dir and reinstall if you want a known 'sane' install
[03:56] <IndyGUnFreak> will, youcan also install automatix to install Non-Free codecs...
[03:56] <tbtrojanek> Kingsqueak: yeah, but I don't have my installation media anymore, a friend has it..
[03:56] <Pelo> will__,  don'T feel intimidated most ppl are just idling
[03:56] <Jordan_U> tbtrojanek: You would remove every package that ubuntu-desktop does not depend on ( although there may be some exceptions to be carefull of like grub ), I am trying to think of a way to automate that.
[03:56] <IndyGUnFreak> http://getautomatix.com
[03:56] <KnowledgEngi> exist some ubuntu tutorial for build a low-latency kernel under ubuntu?

[03:56] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> tbtrojanek: yeah that makes it tough ;-) uninstalling can make a real mess if you're new to this
[03:56] <will__> IndyGUnFreak, : is that a simple sudo alt-get install
[03:56] <nomasteryoda> IndyGUnFreak, thats good, but be careful..
[03:57] <ivx> confusco, do you have any idea on how to do that
[03:57] <netcatc> does someone know where has one repository for packages : metisse
[03:57] <netcatc> nucleo
[03:57] <confusco> no, but as i said, you may not get a good connection over voip.
[03:57] <netcatc> xv_3
[03:57] <IndyGUnFreak> automatix has never given me a problem, ever
[03:57] <will__> I just wanna listen to shoutcast's stuff heh
[03:57] <LjL> !works for me | IndyGUnFreak
[03:57] <ubotu> IndyGUnFreak: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:57] <nomasteryoda> lucky you are indy
[03:57] <KnowledgEngi> i need a low-latency kernel for becouse i use musician software, and much program for musician need "realtime" low-latency kernel
[03:57] <tbtrojanek> Kingsqueak: I'm not new to this, but I was doing that in Synaptic(for sanity reasons..) and it just shut down on me.
[03:57] <ivx> confusco, viop is was clearer than a traditional phone line, i like it way more
[03:57] <KnowledgEngi> i need a low-latency kernel becouse i use musician software, and much program for musician need "realtime" low-latency kernel
[03:57] <IndyGUnFreak> i guess so nomaster
[03:58] <ivx> confusco, vonage is very good
[03:58] <IndyGUnFreak> it worked great for me in Dapper, so when I went to edgy, i installed it again, and it has not caused me a probl
[03:58] <Pelo> KnowledgEngi,  have you tried the forum ?  and stop double posting please
[03:58] <Skwid_> anyone know of any google calendar integration in gnome ?
[03:58] <KnowledgEngi> is not double pasting
[03:58] <confusco> hm
[03:58] <LjL> IndyGUnFreak: if it floats your boat - just don't recommend it here
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> tbtrojanek: I've been doing this for a long time and have made some of my biggest messes by doing mass removal of packages, I just leave stuff kicking around now
[03:58] <Pelo> nomasteryoda,   I never had a problem with automatix either
[03:58] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, ok.
[03:58] <KnowledgEngi> is just a correction of the lust message
[03:58] <will__> ive been having problems all day
[03:58] <will__> but finally got VLC working
[03:58] <IndyGUnFreak> well, you can install XMMS from the Repos
[03:59] <will__> nvidia drivers updated.
[03:59] <DjViper> will__: welcome to my life haha
[03:59] <DjViper> t:P
[03:59] <will__> so yay 4 me.
[03:59] <IndyGUnFreak> it should play mp3's automatically
[03:59] <will__> DjViper, . I went the ubuntu route because XP was pissing me off
[03:59] <tbtrojanek> Kingsqueak: I think I'll just go through getting rid of stuff I know I don't need... Thanks though.
[03:59] <will__> I nearly threw my computer
[03:59] <will__> xmms
[03:59] <LjL> or follow the instructions on the restrictedformats page, the KDE ones aren't that hard
[03:59] <catalytic> whats a good gui for samba?
[03:59] <will__> ill try that.. i just need something simple.
[03:59] <DjViper> will__: what about?  WGA ? :P
[03:59] <will__> WGA?
[03:59] <LjL> i guess the Gnome ones can't be so terrible either
[03:59] <DjViper> Windows Genuine 'Advantage'
[04:00] <will__> DjViper, : Ive been using linux for erm.. 2 days about.
[04:00] <nomasteryoda> DjViper, ewww
[04:00] <DjViper> will__: you'll love it
[04:00] <freemind> :)
[04:00] <IndyGUnFreak> so what problems have people had with Automatix?.. this is the first i've heard this.
[04:00] <freemind> yea
[04:00] <nomasteryoda> will__, congrats
[04:00] <will__> Oh I already love it.
[04:00] <DjViper> nomasteryoda: I said the naughty word, shame on me
[04:00] <will__> thx nomaster.
[04:00] <freemind> :)
[04:00] <Jordan_U> genuin pain in the 'advantage'...
[04:00] <nn> will__: i've been using linux for about 10 years :)
[04:00] <will__> nice
[04:00] <DjViper> lol Jordan_U
[04:00] <will__> I see what all the hubub is about
[04:00] <IndyGUnFreak> i've saw it recommended on LQ many times
[04:00] <will__> linux takes like.. a second to boot up
[04:01] <freemind> will__, welcome to the penguin world :)
[04:01] <DjViper> linux is not hubbub
[04:01] <will__> im over here playing DVD's on VLC with 256mb of ram
[04:01] <nomasteryoda> will__, yes it is superb ..
[04:01] <malt> if i get a domain through godaddy, and pay them through paypal, after i pay and they have got the $$ can i remove godaddy from draft so the next year it comes time to pay it don't auto come out, i just manually pay them again?
[04:01] <will__> I doubt windows could of ever done that
[04:01] <will__> while it has 9000 processes to run.
[04:01] <DjViper> will__: hehe, yeah
[04:01] <confusco> will__ ,why didn't you like XP?
[04:01] <Pelo> nn,   please tell  Plecebo  how to mount his dvd drive manualy please
[04:01] <North64> malt: yes
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> malt: fwiw, I recommend using gandi.net they play less games
[04:01] <will__> confusco, my gf always manages to spyware it
[04:01] <LjL> IndyGUnFreak: the main problem is that you can't track problems. it messes with sources.list, install stuff weirdly, and you have no real logs of what it did. to file bug reports, you need a gmail account. their repositories' directories are 403 forbidden. it's broken many a system.
[04:01] <will__> like she has an amazing ability to do it
[04:01] <nomasteryoda> confusco, too many reasons i'm sure... the 200,000+ bits of bad code always made me cringe
[04:01] <nn> Pelo: Depends on the device
[04:02] <DjViper> will__: so she says yes alot :P
[04:02] <confusco> not like there isn't bad code in Ubuntu
[04:02] <DjViper> <- evil
[04:02] <confusco> I've noticed lots of bugs
[04:02] <will__> lol.
[04:02] <nomasteryoda> will__, i refer to that condition... of a windows box as "myspaced"
[04:02] <nomasteryoda> hehe
[04:02] <IndyGUnFreak> i see LjL.., i guess i've been lucky, cuz it was recommended to me, and I've used it on 6.06 and 6.10, w/o any issues at all.
[04:02] <nn> Plecebo: Run dmesg|grep DVD-ROM
[04:02] <will__> is there an alt-tab equivalent?
[04:02] <DjViper> nomasteryoda: hehehe
[04:02] <will__> myspaced.. pretty much
[04:02] <will__> 'click here...'
[04:02] <will__> 'OK'
[04:02] <Pelo> will__,  yes  alt-tab
[04:02] <will__> (trojan)
[04:02] <IndyGUnFreak> although I dos eem to remember the repository issue under 6.06.., but automatix2, doesn't seem to do that under edgy...
[04:02] <malt> Kingsqueak: they don't have .us domains there
[04:02] <DjViper> alt-tab works fine
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> malt: k
[04:02] <will__> pelo LOL.
[04:02] <confusco> ya alt tab is the same
[04:03] <will__> never even tried it hehe
[04:03] <malt> Kingsqueak: know anymore thats good?
[04:03] <nn> mount /dev/`dmesg|grep DVD|cut -f 1 -d ':'|cut -f 2 -d
[04:03] <eracc> ping! Hi all, what is the Firefox extension that prevents download links from opening a new blank page/tab?
[04:03] <nn> mount /dev/`dmesg|grep DVD|cut -f 1 -d ':'|cut -f 2 -d ' '|head -1` /cdrom
[04:03] <will__> DjViper, : DO i have to uninstall after XMMS?
[04:03] <will__> err restart**
[04:03] <DjViper> will__: no?
[04:03] <Pelo> Plecebo,   what nn is saying is for you , pay attention
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> malt: nah, I have just used gandi for several years and they are honest and no trouble, register.com screwed around with me hard, I finally got completely off of them
[04:03] <Jordan_U> eracc: No extention needed, it's in the preferences
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> Will, you shouldn't have to.
[04:04] <eracc> Jordan_U, ah, ok. Thanks.
[04:04] <will__> is the rhapsody music player any good?
[04:04] <will__> or should I use something else?
[04:04] <will__> itunes for linux :o?
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> will, I like XMMS, but i'm sure opinions vary
[04:04] <nn> Plecebo: If you do 'dmesg|grep DVD' you'll get some lines similar to [17179574.308000]  hdc: BENQ DVD DD DW1620, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> malt: the godaddy issues I've heard about have to do with the features of their domain management GUI and I've heard their service is bad if you have questions or issues
[04:04] <sn00p|> how do I make it so ubuntu when I start it auto mounts my nfs server?
[04:04] <will__> is xmms a program that plays mp3s?
[04:04] <nomasteryoda> will__, er i would recommend Amarok ... supports Magnatune
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> yes WIll.
[04:04] <freemind> sn00p|, add it to /etc/fstab
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> its int he repositories
[04:04] <will__> oh, i thought it was just a driver.
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> no.
[04:04] <IndyGUnFreak> its a program
[04:04] <Jordan_U> sn00p|: By server do you mean partition?
[04:04] <jrib> will__: yes, but you can install packages to make the default programs play mp3s
[04:04] <will__> I installed it, tried to play the mp3 in rhapsody. No go.
[04:04] <sn00p|> freemind, how do I do it, mount ip:/ /home directory?
[04:05] <sn9> IndyGUnFreak: i made my own automatix/easyubuntu-type thing, but i haven't updated it for edgy yet. however, for new installations of dapper, i highly recommend it
[04:05] <DjViper> will__: easyubuntu.freecontrib.org
[04:05] <IndyGUnFreak> right, install XMMS
[04:05] <nn> Plecebo: The hdc: part is what you need to know, that's the device name of the DVD drive, so you'd do something like "mount -t iso9660,udf /dev/hdc /cdrom" or similar
[04:05] <will__> IndyGUnFreak, : its installe.d
[04:05] <IndyGUnFreak> then open XMMS, and open an MP3.
[04:05] <IndyGUnFreak> it should play
[04:05] <malt> Kingssqueak ever heard about this host www.namecheap.com ?
[04:05] <nomasteryoda> will__,  you also have to install the libs.. see the proprietary info
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> malt: nope
[04:05] <nomasteryoda> !mp3

[04:05] <nomasteryoda> restricted that is
[04:05] <sn00p|> freemind, is that right?
[04:06] <freemind> sn00p|, I dont know, sorry - just take a look at google or, if already mounted look at "mount" output
[04:06] <ctkroeker> what's the general opinion towards gnewsense
[04:07] <IndyGUnFreak> the ubuntu wiki has a lot of stuff on installing mp3 codecs also...  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper
[04:07] <freemind> :)
[04:07] <IndyGUnFreak> check 6.21
[04:08] <KnowledgEngi> System timer resolution is too low
[04:08] <KnowledgEngi> Rosegarden was unable to find a high-resolution timing source for MIDI
[04:08] <KnowledgEngi> performance.
[04:08] <KnowledgEngi> This may mean you are using a Linux system with the kernel timer

[04:08] <NoStop> lost autocomplete here in konversation. anyone know how to get it back?
[04:08] <Plecebo> nn, sorry I got it fixed, not sure how but i enected it and put the same dvd back in again and it worked this time... thanks for your help
[04:09] <ExxonValdeez> is it possible for me to change the start-up resolution settings? I dont see anything when I start the computer. this just when i boot into ubuntu
[04:09] <NoStop> never mind, the guy I was trying to input left, guess that's why it didn't autocomplete :-)

[04:09] <nn> Plecebo: ah, np
[04:09] <nn> Plecebo: Also mount /cdrom will work, assuming your /etc/fstab file is correct
[04:10] <nn> Plecebo: correction /media/cdrom0
[04:10] <capiCrimm> there isn't any default firewall running on ubuntu is there?
[04:10] <will__> thx for the info
[04:10] <nomasteryoda> capiCrimm, nope... the ports are all closed
[04:10] <nomasteryoda> unless you open them up
[04:10] <nn> ie by installing a server process
[04:10] <Bilange> capiCrimm, theres no firewall at all
[04:11] <Plecebo> nn, yea i tried that but i think my dvd drive is not mounted in /media/cdromX it is /media/dvdrecorder
[04:11] <Plecebo> nn, thanks for the help
[04:11] <nn> Plecebo: Interesting.. my dvd burner shows up as /media/cdrom0
[04:11] <nomasteryoda> !firewall
[04:11] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:11] <Plecebo> nn, surprised me as well, but it is mounted and working now :) thanks
[04:11] <nn> [17179574.308000]  hdc: BENQ DVD DD DW1620, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive [17179574.792000]  hdc: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM DVD-R CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA (33)
[04:11] <IndyGUnFreak> will, did it work?
[04:11] <nomasteryoda> i prefer guarddog
[04:13] <will__> IndyGUnFreak,  eh, im still reading through this
[04:13] <IndyGUnFreak> oh ok.
[04:13] <will__> did the XMMS thing work? I havent tried. I was told I have to install the libraries still right?>
[04:13] <IndyGUnFreak> no
[04:13] <IndyGUnFreak> XMMS automatically plays MP3s
[04:14] <will__> where is xmms located? and is there a command I can run to always find what folder a file is in?
[04:14] <freemind> yes
[04:14] <freemind> "which"
[04:14] <freemind> try: which xmms
[04:14] <will__> k
[04:14] <IndyGUnFreak> if you installed it, it should be in your Sound/Video menu
[04:14] <will__> its in usr/bin
[04:14] <IndyGUnFreak> ok
[04:14] <IndyGUnFreak> open a terminal
[04:14] <freemind> that dir should be in your $PATH
[04:14] <IndyGUnFreak> and just type xmms
[04:14] <IndyGUnFreak> it should start
[04:14] <freemind> yes :)
[04:14] <freemind> exactly

[04:16] <will__> I have it hooked up to my 42" plasma downstairs.
[04:16] <NoStop> Does Beep Media Player require codecs to play mp3s or does it have it builtin like xmms?
[04:16] <will__> so i can play my borrowed' dvds.
[04:16] <IndyGUnFreak> nostop
[04:16] <will__> and radio action

[04:17] <will__> thanks so much guys
[04:17] <Plecebo> anyone know a good method for converting lots of audio files/formats (aac ogg flac mp3) to one format (mp3 or ogg) easily?
[04:17] <IndyGUnFreak> no prob will.
[04:17] <IndyGUnFreak> i dont' use beep though, so i'm not positive, XMMS is the only one I know of that plays tem automatically
[04:19] <freemind> Plecebo, look for "audacity"
[04:19] <freemind> in synaptic
[04:19] <freemind> :)
[04:20] <Plecebo> freemind, i've got audacity, didnt know it could do that :) thanks i'll look into it :D

[04:33] <kitche> kishan: can you paste /etc/fstab
[04:33] <kitche> kishan: swap is like a pagefile

[04:33] <thinh> so long i havent used irc
[04:34] <LjL> !best
[04:34] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[04:34] <thinh> i have a saa7134 card

[04:34] <thinh> i got my ati setup correct

[04:34] <thinh> the thing is kernel see my card but i cant use it
[04:34] <DisabledDuck> ok, fine, what are some p2p programs for Linux?
[04:35] <noodles12> what p2p programs do you guys use?

[04:48] <kishan> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33205/
[04:48] <Jordan_U> lakbu: Yes, what specifically do you want the server to do?
[04:48] <zillabox> and the ubuntu OS already saw the giga card
[04:48] <kishan> this is it
[04:48] <zillabox> but it won't retrieve any ip add from the server
[04:48] <lakbu> slavik: what does it take to make it a media server? what are the components taht need to be installed. im llookiing for an alternative of the windoze media server
[04:48] <kishan> anything else kitche
[04:48] <slavik> zillabox: by server you mean dhcp server?
[04:48] <zillabox> yes sir
[04:48] <slavik> lakbu: media server as a streaming stuff thingy?
[04:49] <slavik> zillabox: are you in ubuntu right now?
[04:49] <zillabox> im working with a new dhcp server using giga network
[04:49] <lakbu> slavik: yes.
[04:49] <zillabox> 5.10
[04:49] <confusco> why is it that when I copy from something, and then close it, paste no longer works?
[04:49] <kitche> kishan: well you have a swap not sure why you have # at the start of each device line though
[04:49] <slavik> lakbu: you need to stream music (shoutcast?), video (also shoutcast?) ... and other stuff
[04:49] <zillabox> im trying to test it in our existing network
[04:49] <Jordan_U> lakbu: I would recommend knoppmyth, it is a distribution made specifically for this.
[04:49] <Clinton__> confusco: guessing here, the copy is actually a reference point in memory that no longer exists when you close it
[04:49] <slavik> zillabox: in network, try 'dhclient eth0'
[04:50] <lakbu> slavik: yes. videos.
[04:50] <zillabox> but it won't retrieve any ip from the server
[04:50] <zillabox> ok, for a while =)
[04:50] <kishan> say i know that i have a swap but it says it is failed
[04:50] <kishan> is there any thing wrong with fstab
[04:50] <lakbu> Jordan_U: thanks. it's a debian based distro?
[04:50] <kishan> i have upgraded from drapper to edgy
[04:50] <Jordan_U> lakbu: Yes, based on knoppix
[04:50] <slavik> lakbu: I really dunno tbh, never set one up ...
[04:50] <kishan> may be this is the reason for it
[04:50] <kitche> kishan: like I said don't know why # is at the beginning of each device line that might cause some problems
[04:50] <sn9> kishan: yes, the edgy upgrader screwed it up a bit
[04:51] <slavik> sn9: what is the proper code for Koi8 encoding?
[04:51] <kishan> So what can i do now

[04:53] <zillabox> any other options?
[04:53] <zillabox> i already did the dhclient
[04:53] <Jordan_U> lakbu: Of course, I don't know what features knoppmyth has though, it may be easier just to set up MythTV on Ubuntu if you want other functions also.

[05:08] <Jordan_U> sn9: Tried a dpkg-reconfigure?
[05:08] <sn9> kitche: SIGILL, not SIGSEGV
[05:09] <sn9> Jordan_U: of what? firefox itself?
[05:09] <Jordan_U> sn9: Yes.
[05:09] <sn9> i tried reinstalling it, but will now try reconfig
[05:10] <kitche> sn9: ah so it does an illegal instruction hmm that seems very odd to me
[05:10] <arepie> Jordan_U: sometimes.. after some period of using compiz/aiglx, my X will crashed automaticaly.. what cause that to happen?
[05:10] <K^Holtz> hi sn9: i upgraded for real this time.. but now im getting an 'index is broken' error when i click the update button in the tray
[05:10] <rickyfingers> sn9: how about opening a terminal and typing mozilla-firefox 2>1&1 | tee firefox-error.log
[05:11] <kitche> K^Holtz: you have to apt-get update most likely
[05:11] <Jordan_U> arepie: Try #ubuntu-xgl for more help with beryl / compiz issues.
[05:11] <rickyfingers> sn9: then any kind of messages firefox puts out before it crashes will be in that firefox-error.log
[05:12] <rickyfingers> sn9: then you can pastebin it and anyone here can have a  look
[05:12] <K^Holtz> kitche: sortware index is still broken

[05:15] <Jordan_U> Is there a way to get this page working in Ubuntu? http://www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/full_episodes/?show=heroes
[05:15] <kitche> rickyfingers: that's for watching dvd's not burning it
[05:16] <mr_daemon> rickyfingers, I doubt it has anything to do with smb/cifs...
[05:16] <rickyfingers> mr_daemon: like I said, wild guess. I take it what you are talking about has nothing to do with SAMBA
[05:16] <mr_daemon> rickyfingers, In fact, it does.
[05:16] <K^Holtz> hmm it actually still says i have dapper after downloading over 800 files
[05:16] <rickyfingers> mr_daemon: or smba or however one spells it.
[05:17] <thinh> how to i get into the kernel editing mode? my menuconfig is not working
[05:17] <sn9> rickyfingers: kernel-level ntfs write support is obsolete/deprecated -- where have you been?
[05:17] <mr_daemon> rickyfingers, smb is pretty much the protocol spoken by samba.
[05:17] <rickyfingers> sn9: maybe I'm using the wrong terminology, when you do  make menuconfig
[05:18] <kitche> thinh: make menumenuconfig there is also an X version of it called make xconfig
[05:18] <sn9> rickyfingers: that's obsolete/deprecated
[05:18] <fysaen> good morning everyone =)
[05:18] <rickyfingers> sn9: when compiling 2.6.18.2, under filesystems->ntfs->ntfs write support
[05:18] <sn9> rickyfingers: never ever enable that
[05:18] <rickyfingers> sn9: the default .config from the edgy install does not have that option set to yes
[05:18] <Jordan_U> !fuse | rickyfingers
[05:18] <ubotu> rickyfingers: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[05:19] <kitche> rickyfingers: the stable version is actually in 2.6.19
[05:19] <rickyfingers> kitche: stable version of ntfs write module?
[05:19] <kitche> rickyfingers: yes according to what I have been reading
[05:19] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: That is an oximoron :)
[05:20] <rickyfingers> Jordan_U: heh
[05:20] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: Use fuse instead.
[05:20] <sn9> if you want stable ntfs, ONLY use the fuse thing
[05:20] <Phuzion> !bonecho
[05:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bonecho - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:20] <Phuzion> !bon echo
[05:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bon echo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:20] <Phuzion> !firefox 2.0
[05:20] <ubotu> firefox: lightweight web browser based on Mozilla. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0+0dfsg-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 9001 kB, installed size 28588 kB
[05:21] <kitche> Jorda_U: well according to lmk there is a stable ntfs write mode in 2.6.19 haven't tried it myself yet since it's still in the early stages
[05:21] <rickyfingers> kitche: looking at kernel.org... latest prepatch for stable kernel is 2.6.19-rc6
[05:21] <sn9> kitche: that doesn't make sense
[05:21] <Jordan_U> Phuzion: It was only called bon echo during Beta
[05:21] <rickyfingers> kitche: so it's still just a release candidate
[05:22] <K^Holtz> can someone please try to help me with this error?
[05:22] <KnowledgEngi> there is some channel for support about ubuntu kernel building ???
[05:22] <Phuzion> Jordan_U:  I'm aware of that, I was just wondering if it was still in the repositores as bon echo, or if it got updated to 2.0 yet
[05:23] <K^Holtz> Software Index not found
[05:23] <KnowledgEngi> in the channel #ubuntu-kernel the people tall that do not give support
[05:23] <zircx> anyone run the ubuntu server?
[05:23] <Phuzion> zircx:  which one?
[05:23] <kitche> KnowledgEngi: not really but it's pretty much the same for all distros on how you make a kernel
[05:23] <Jordan_U> Phuzion: In Edgy the "firefox" package is firefox 2.0 , for dapper it may be in backports
[05:24] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: I've already volunteered THREE TIMES to walk you through it.
[05:24] <kitche> Phuzion: yes firefox 2.0 is in dapper-backports for dapper
[05:24] <KnowledgEngi> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild?highlight=%28CategoryKernel%29
[05:24] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: I don't know how much clearer I can make it
[05:24] <KnowledgEngi> i'm reading this document
[05:24] <zircx> Phuzion, wanting to set up a file server / apache with mysql , php / samba (print server) / mail server ..
[05:24] <zircx> just trying to get a feel for what I'm going to use to achieve that ..
[05:24] <KnowledgEngi> but i have some problem using it
[05:24] <KnowledgEngi> becouse some directory do not exist
[05:25] <Geewiz> just one quick question, how can I get to the ubuntu partition manager?
[05:25] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: if you're wanting to use -rt, please use a vanilla kernel. DO NOT attempt to use the low latency and/or rt patches with patches Ubunt linux source.
[05:25] <Phuzion> ubotu, tell zircx about LAMP
[05:25] <frantic> Hey, does anyone here have a System76 computer?
[05:25] <KnowledgEngi> .  debian/config/i386/
[05:25] <mr_daemon> Okay my windows share always comes out as read only no matter what I do when mounted... any ideas?
[05:25] <KnowledgEngi> this directory do not exist into linux-source directory
[05:25] <kitche> KnowledgEngi: I usually use a vanilla kernel
[05:25] <Phuzion> zircx, did ubotu message you?
[05:25] <Jordan_U>  Geewiz: System -> Administration -> gnome partition editor.
[05:25] <rickyfingers> KnowlegEngi: this is what I do: download/uncompress kernel source tree
[05:25] <mister_roboto> Jordan_U: that link you sent about fuse on ubuntu wiki is only for dapper. does the very same work on edgy?
[05:25] <kitche> KnowledgEngi: you probably have a vanilla source then
[05:25] <Geewiz> thx
[05:26] <zircx> Phuzion, thanks i'll have a nosey
[05:26] <rickyfingers> knowldegEngi:the just follow directions in the README
[05:26] <zircx> Phuzion, do you use ubuntu for your server?
[05:26] <Phuzion> Yes
[05:26] <frantic> mrdaemon, you mean network share?
[05:26] <KnowledgEngi> i just need a kernel that solve this problem
[05:26] <KnowledgEngi> System timer resolution is too low Rosegarden was unable to find a high-resolution timing source for MIDI performance. This may mean you are using a Linux system with the kernel timer resolution set too low. Please contact your Linux distributor for more information.
[05:26] <zircx> how do you find it from a personal perspective using it..
[05:26] <Jordan_U> mister_roboto: I don't use windows and therefore am not burdened with such things :P ( I have no idea ) :)
[05:26] <Phuzion> its easy to install
[05:26] <Phuzion> however, to get things to your liking, you will need to do some tweaking
[05:26] <zircx> i see
[05:27] <Phuzion> but that is to be expected with all webserver packages
[05:27] <rickyfingers> knowldegEngi: hmmm. don't know for sure, but sounds like you might have to end up tweaking actual source code
[05:27] <SilentSnow> Hi, I'm very very very new to ubuntu, and hardly have any clue what i'm diong, could someone please explain to me in very easy to follow steps how to install a wusb54g v4 wireless adapter to me please?
[05:27] <joedj> how do i perform a server install of edgy?
[05:27] <Phuzion> for example, I wanted to use vhosts so I could have my administration tools on a different port, so I had to mess with apache's config file and create some vhost blocks
[05:27] <KnowledgEngi> somebody tall that i need a low-latency kernel
[05:27] <tonyyarusso> joedj: dl the server ISO, away you go
[05:27] <KnowledgEngi> and i need use jackd too
[05:28] <joedj> tonyyarusso, doh. i already have the install/live dvd
[05:28] <KnowledgEngi> for install jack i have no problem
[05:28] <KnowledgEngi> the problem is the kernel
[05:28] <Phuzion> zircx:  you may also want to read up on http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06 if you want to do a little more indepth reading on the subject
[05:28] <zircx> Phuzion, that's pretty simple stuff, but that makes sense.. I was more concerned with the mail server side.. apache / php / mysql is a walk in the park
[05:28] <tonyyarusso> joedj: Well, it can still be done, but the server CD makes it really easy
[05:28] <Phuzion> mail server isn't crazy hard, just read some documentation, and know what you want to do before you dive into it
[05:28] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: technically it's just the HZ parameter
[05:29] <Phuzion> like, know how you'd like to have it configured so you can stay on task when writing/modifying config files and whatnot
[05:29] <zircx> i know what I want.. it's just seeing how much pain i'm going to have to go through in changing stuff around and the functionality
[05:29] <zircx> lol
[05:29] <KnowledgEngi> did you read the error returned by rosegarden?
[05:29] <Phuzion> exactly, that's how it always is, just figuring out what you want to do
[05:29] <Phuzion> lol
[05:29] <zircx> oh postfix, interesting, I've dabbled in that a little.
[05:29] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: yes.
[05:30] <KnowledgEngi> and wath you suggest ?
[05:30] <Jordan_U> SilentSnow: Did it work on the LiveCD?
[05:30] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: change the HZ parameter
[05:30] <SilentSnow> nope
[05:30] <SilentSnow> it didnt
[05:30] <aj_> anyone here try to install kxdocker?
[05:30] <zircx> well that looks relatively simple the
[05:30] <zircx> 'the perfect setup'
[05:31] <Jordan_U> aj_: Try #kubuntu , they are the KDE people :)
[05:31] <aj_> oh ok
[05:31] <joejaxx> How are all you Ubuntu users doing today? :)
[05:31] <Phuzion> joejaxx, I'm well, and yourself?

[05:32] <KnowledgEngi> correcy crimsun
[05:32] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: no. Use a vanilla kernel if you're going to attempt to use rt/ll
[05:32] <Phuzion> joejaxx, is there something that we can help you out with today, or are you just coming to chat and offer help?

[05:49] <Ferret_> Hey I've been trying to install ubuntu over netboot on my iBook using this HOWTO https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/WindowsServerNetboot only with the PPC images. After some fiddling I managed to get it to actually try to boot, now it just goes "Loading ELF CLAIM failed".
[05:49] <PumpkinPie> where is iozone package?
[05:49] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: so set that in the kernel configuration. I presume you can do that independently.
[05:49] <joejaxx> madmazz: maybe it is true
[05:49] <Ferret_> Any idea what's wrong?
[05:49] <madmazz> joejaxx: ALL of them?
[05:50] <KnowledgEngi> if i run only make without option is a problem?
[05:50] <sn9> Ferret_: i'm probably the only one in here who knows what you mean
[05:50] <KnowledgEngi> becouse i do not know what option i must use
[05:50] <joejaxx> madmazz: lol
[05:50] <Ferret_> sn9 - Oh?
[05:50] <cmwe1> catalytic, i meant whats the command. thaat page leads me too login as a root without making the root accont
[05:50] <joejaxx> madmazz: sounds like a problem with gaim
[05:51] <joejaxx> madmazz: did you try taking off that proxy option they have enabled by default?
[05:51] <sn9> Ferret_: the vmlinux and ramdisk files -- how big are they together?
[05:51] <Ferret_> sn9 - Lemme check, one second.
[05:51] <madmazz> joejaxx: good idea, where's that at? Proxy options at yahoo or global gaim settings?
[05:52] <joejaxx> madmazz: under accounts
[05:52] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, if i build using just "make" without option, can i have some problem?
[05:52] <cmwe1> User Poll: How long did it take for you to become aquanted with linux
[05:52] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: yes, it will be a problem unless you follow a standard how-to.
[05:52] <madmazz> joejaxx: thanks
[05:52] <Ferret_> Think I know the problem, there is no ramdisk file. It wasn
[05:52] <joejaxx> madmazz: you are most welcome
[05:52] <kodat> so who is really good at ubuntu..when i do sudo iwconfig eth1 rate 54M it doest stick..it just goes back downw to 11MB within 1 few seconds...and ive added up iwconfig eth1 rate 54M to /etc/network/interfaces but no dice
[05:52] <PumpkinPie> apt-setup doesn't work ?
[05:52] <Ferret_> wasn't at the link in the netboot howto.
[05:52] <joejaxx> sn9: Ferret_: netboot? that is always great :)
[05:53] <Ferret_> (This link: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/installer-powerpc/current//images/powerpc/netboot/)
[05:53] <sn9> Ferret_: wait -- are you installing, or trying to boot an installed system?
[05:53] <cmwe1> Kingsqueak, how do i add myself to a group such as www-data
[05:53] <Ferret_> sn9 - I'm trying to install via netboot.
[05:54] <sn9> Ferret_: then it's not possible for the howto not to mention the ramdisk
[05:54] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: Why are you installing hoary?
[05:54] <Ferret_> Oop wrong link..
[05:54] <kodat> so who is really good at ubuntu..when i do sudo iwconfig eth1 rate 54M it doest stick..it just goes back downw to 11MB within a few seconds...and ive added up iwconfig eth1 rate 54M to /etc/network/interfaces but no dice
[05:54] <Ferret_> This one http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/main/installer-powerpc/current//images/ Damn apache indexes all look the same.
[05:55] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, I has read some document about kernel building but i never used parameter for make
[05:55] <Kingsqueak> cmwe1: 'sudo nano /etc/group'  at the end of the www-data line, add the user, if one is there called foo, make it look like   foo,bar   to add 'bar'
[05:55] <silvertip257> I have found a link explaining how to build my specific set of drivers for my wireless card, but do not have enough experience to know how to compile it or whateve
[05:55] <silvertip257> r
[05:55] <cmwe1> kingsqueak, thank you
[05:55] <saquib> #ubuntu-xgl
[05:55] <Ferret_> sn9 - I don't see RAM disk mentioned anywhere here https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/powerpc/install-tftp.html or here https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/powerpc/ch05s01.html#boot-tftp
[05:55] <NoStop> what is the command for reloading the gnome taskbar? I forget.
[05:56] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, can you tall me what i need to read for understand what option i need to you for make ?
[05:56] <Jordan_U> NoStop: Gnome panel you mean? killall gnome-panel
[05:56] <KnowledgEngi> *you=use
[05:56] <saquib> After I updated to Edgy xgl sessions won't always load properly, but I have no idea if it's xgl or gnome failing, I just get the black (or gray) xgl screen with nothing on it and maybe the top and bottom panels (albeit empty). I'll usually have to try logging in at least twice or maybe three times before it works
[05:56] <Ferret_> That's the one I'm following, with some minor tips from the howto explaining how to netboot from a windows machine, this one:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/WindowsServerNetboot
[05:56] <saquib> please help
[05:57] <NoStop> Jordan_U: and that will reload it? I thought it was another command that did this.
[05:57] <silvertip257> wireless driver building ... help please
[05:57] <sn9> Ferret_: what do you mean? it's right there
[05:57] <Jordan_U> NoStop: Yes, that will reload it.
[05:57] <Klick> anyone know how to make it so a user doesnt have a password?
[05:57] <cmwe1> one more question before im off. How do i make a shortcut to a folder placed on my desktop such as /var/www
[05:57] <Kingsqueak> I do all day
[05:57] <Kingsqueak> doh, wrong win
[05:57] <Ferret_> sn9 - Where?
[05:57] <sn9> in the last paragraph
[05:58] <kodat> so who is really good at ubuntu..when i do sudo iwconfig eth1 rate 54M it doest stick..it just goes back downw to 11MB within a few seconds...and ive added up iwconfig eth1 rate 54M to /etc/network/interfaces but no dice
[05:58] <Jordan_U> cmwe1: ln -s thing shortcutToThing
[05:58] <NoStop> yep, Jordan_U, that worked. Except it didn't reload the update icon and that is what's missing now.
[05:58] <Jordan_U> cmwe1: In Unix it is called a symbolic link BTW
[05:58] <Ferret_> sn9 - Which file is the ramdisk? Just to make sure I got it all.
[05:59] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, "make all" is good ?
[05:59] <cmwe1> Jordan_U, so ln -s /var/www /home/clint/Desktop ?
[05:59] <Ferret_> I'm about to feel like an idiot aren't I?
[05:59] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, or: make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install
[06:00] <Jordan_U> cmwe1: No, ln -s /var/www /home/clint/Desktop/var( or whatever you want to call it )
[06:00] <cmwe1> i did ln -s /var/www /home/clint/Desktop and it worked
[06:00] <CharlieSu> would anyone be willing to SSH into my box with bad passwords and usernames to help me test my DenyHosts config?
[06:01] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: the latter
[06:01] <Blue_Max> hey all...just got ubuntu running, very cool
[06:01] <sn9> Ferret_: it won't work anyway, because the files are too big
[06:01] <Klick> anyone know which file tells linux weather or not a user can have a blank password ?
[06:01] <hsunda3> Hello! I am just curious to know .. grep ^CLOCK file will show lines in file beginning with CLOCK. How do I negate it using reg exp? (I can use grep -v, but I want regex)
[06:02] <Jordan_U> cmwe1:  nvm then :)
[06:02] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, make bzImage && make modules_install
[06:02] <KnowledgEngi> ?
[06:02] <cmwe1> kingsqueak, please i do not feel like rebooting again, will chown clint /var/www ONLY do the www dir
[06:02] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: don't forget make modules
[06:02] <Ferret_> sn9 - They are? So I can't install via netboot? Gotta find an alternative then, CD drive on the iBook is dead and I don't have easy access to an external drive.
[06:03] <cmwe1> I know it sounds crazy but
[06:03] <cmwe1> i need to confirm
[06:03] <Ferret_> Aside from an iPod, and I gave up trying that a long time ago.
[06:04] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, using make oldconfig i must puch "enter" for each question ??
[06:04] <sn9> Ferret_: you might try something older than edgy
[06:04] <KnowledgEngi> becouse make olconfig ask me something
[06:04] <TuTUx> ?
[06:04] <Ferret_> Dapper?
[06:04] <sn9> looking at the dapper files now
[06:04] <sn9> they still look too big
[06:04] <KnowledgEngi> and i do not know if the default answare [y/n]  are ok
[06:04] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: How would the alternate CD help if the drive is broken?
[06:05] <Ferret_> I'm going to try, see what happens.
[06:05] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: if you're not sure, accept the defaults
[06:05] <cmwe1> See yall, im going to get money, and no not by being a hooker :-D
[06:05] <ripper> i cant seem to get the splash to come up that is supposed to load after grub, any suggestions?
[06:06] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: You can boot holding down T and it will boot your iBook as a glorified firewire drive and you can install from another machine.
[06:06] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, and if i accept all defaults the support included in my oldconfig are considered yes ?
[06:06] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: no
[06:06] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: vanilla kernel does not contain all the patches that Ubuntu's kernel team applies
[06:07] <Ferret_> Jordan_U - Will that work even if the only other machine I got is a PC?
[06:07] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: Or does it have firewire? .... I can't remember, I don't think target disk mode works with USB.
[06:08] <KnowledgEngi>  NatSemi SCx200 27MHz High-Resolution Timer Support (SCx200HR_TIMER) [M/n/?]  (NEW)
[06:08] <KnowledgEngi> timer ......
[06:08] <KnowledgEngi> is related to realtime ???
[06:08] <Ferret_> Jordan_U - The iBook has firewire, I've used it in target mode before.
[06:08] <KnowledgEngi> a ok, is module
[06:08] <Ferret_> Just not sure installing a PC version on it will do me any good.
[06:09] <sn9> Ferret_: what's installed on it now?
[06:09] <Ferret_> OS X 10.4.8
[06:09] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: Yes, If you can figure out how to run the PPC installer from an x86 machine, it is definitely possible but I don't think anybody has made an x86 installer that installs a PPC distro.
[06:09] <Ferret_> Jordan_U - What I feard :/
[06:09] <Ferret_> *feared
[06:10] <sn9> you can boot the netinstaller from an osx partition, but i don't know whether it can handle tiger
[06:11] <Ferret_> sn9 - How?
[06:11] <sn9> you have to muck with yaboot and openfirmware, tho
[06:11] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: There may be some hacking foo you can do like copying the LiveCD contents to the drive but it certainly wouldn't be straightforward.
[06:11] <sn9> i've done it before
[06:12] <Ferret_> sn9 - I'm mucking about with yaboot and openfirmware right now.
[06:12] <Jordan_U> sn9: I miss open firmware :(
[06:12] <sn9> btw, do you intend to shrink the osx partition, or replace osx?
[06:13] <Ferret_> Replace it, the iBook is an old G3, doesn't run well with 10.4
[06:13] <sn9> 500MHz?
[06:13] <Ferret_> 700
[06:14] <spunconfuse_> what was open firmware?
[06:14] <sn9> 10.3 looks faster than ubuntu on my 600
[06:14] <Jordan_U> spunconfuse_: BIOS on crack :)
[06:14] <CharlieSu> crack is good Jordan_U
[06:14] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun,
[06:14] <KnowledgEngi> Processor type and features --> Timer frequency (i must change from 250 HZ  1000 HZ) ??
[06:15] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: yes
[06:15] <Jordan_U> CharlieSu: So is Open Firmware.
[06:15] <Ferret_> sn9 - Besides I've been wanting to have a machine with Linux on it for a while and putting it on my iBook seems as good an idea as any.
[06:15] <CharlieSu> Jordan_U: yes.. i've used it...
[06:15] <Ferret_> If I can get it to install.
[06:16] <CharlieSu> anyone want to try and help test my DenyHosts config? I need some brute force SSH attemps to my box..
[06:16] <KnowledgEngi> that is all for low-latency ??
[06:16] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: no
[06:16] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: didn't you apply the ll/rt patches?
[06:16] <KnowledgEngi> no
[06:16] <crimsun> ...
[06:16] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: PPC linux is not fun for a first go at linux, I know, my first Linux machine was my powerbook, it was painfull.
[06:17] <sn9> Ferret_: that howto seems to say to serve up only a single file over tftp. i've never tried it that way. is that what you did?
[06:17] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, i have not this patch, and i do not know where can i find it
[06:17] <zillabox> im trying to set a dhcp server
[06:17] <zillabox> but
[06:17] <zillabox> after i command apt-get install dhcpd
[06:17] <Ferret_> sn9 - Which one of them? The one telling how to set up the server on Windows or the other one?
[06:17] <sn9> the other
[06:18] <zillabox> it says, couldn't find package
[06:18] <zillabox> i need help
[06:18] <kodat> so who is really good at ubuntu..when i do sudo iwconfig eth1 rate 54M it doest stick..it just goes back downw to 11MB within a few seconds...and ive added up iwconfig eth1 rate 54M to /etc/network/interfaces but no dice
[06:18] <zillabox> please
[06:18] <sn9> Ferret_: btw, i'm currently chatting from an ibook 600 running dapper. i originally installed breezy on it in july 2005
[06:19] <Ferret_> Well I got it to load the installer for a little while then it whined about a bad yaboot.conf file, so I moved things around a bit and now I'm getting the 'Loading ELF, CLAIM failed' messages and I got no idea what they mean.
[06:19] <sn9> and the breezy was a netboot install
[06:19] <zillabox> i need help guys
[06:19] <zillabox> after i command apt-get install dhcpd
[06:19] <zillabox> it says, couldn't find package
[06:20] <Ferret_> sn9 - Well if breezy worked for you, I'm gonan give it a try.
[06:20] <sn9> it didn't, really. lots of stuff i had to go to dapper for
[06:20] <infer_> !dhcp
[06:20] <ubotu> dhcp: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0pl5-19.4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 108 kB, installed size 308 kB
[06:21] <jontec> how do I insert special charaters like an accented e?
[06:21] <sn9> the built-in microphone will likely require at least edgy
[06:21] <jontec> characters*
[06:21] <Ferret_> sn9 - I meant the install. Isn't it possilble to update once you get it installed?
[06:21] <phxheat> how do i get beagle to always be in the task bar?
[06:22] <FloK> to upgrade to edgy: in wiki tutorial there is:
[06:22] <bimberi> zillabox: yes, wrong name, should be dhcp3-server
[06:22] <FloK> gksudo update-manager -c
[06:22] <sn9> Ferret_: that's what i joined the channel for help with today -- firefox and synaptic broke in my upgrade
[06:22] <FloK> gksudo: invalid option -- c
[06:22] <joedj> anyone using apt-proxy?
[06:22] <Ferret_> sn9 - To Edgy or Dapper?
[06:22] <FloK> what's the correct command?
[06:22] <sn9> dapper
[06:23] <joedj> i'm wondering if i can apt-proxy dapper and edgy at the same time
[06:23] <Ferret_> Hrm...tricky stuff this Linux..
[06:23] <bimberi> FloK: gksudo "update-manager -c"   (the quotes are needed)
[06:23] <FloK> thx
[06:23] <bimberi> yw
[06:24] <Ferret_> YAAAS!
[06:24] <Ferret_> IT BOOTS!
[06:24] <sn9> Ferret_: an ibook 700 with a broken cd drive can make a very decent ubuntu machine -- at least until the motherboard dies, which it will
[06:24] <Ferret_> Sorry about that.
[06:25] <Ferret_> And it dies, ramdisk problems..
[06:27] <phrontist> hello! The easyubuntu server is down, any ideas on how I can get it?
[06:28] <Jordan_U> phrontist: We can help you install stuff without it.
[06:28] <sn9> phrontist: are you installing 6.06 or 6.10?
[06:28] <phrontist> sn9: of what?
[06:28] <sn9> ubuntu
[06:29] <Jordan_U> sn9: easyubuntu, not Ubuntu
[06:29] <spunconfuse_> when I plug in my usb memory stick reader it recognizes it. but when I click on it I get this error "Unable to mount the floppy drive. The floppy is probably in a format that cannot be mounted."
[06:29] <spunconfuse_> can I re-mount this
[06:30] <phrontist> I think I can install the packages myself, shame easyubuntu is down though
[06:30] <sn9> phrontist: did you want easyubuntu for 6.06 or 6.10 of ubuntu?
[06:30] <phrontist> it makes things so pleasant
[06:30] <phrontist> sn9: how do I check version?
[06:30] <phrontist> this is a fresh install from one of the free CDs
[06:30] <sn9> dapper or edgy?
[06:30] <phrontist> dapper
[06:30] <sn9> dapper is 6.06
[06:30] <phrontist> okay
[06:31] <sn9> for 6.06, instead of easyubuntu, look at the following URL:
[06:31] <Madpilot> !restricted
[06:31] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[06:31] <sn9> http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/conspire/2006-June/002071.html
[06:31] <FloK> the filelist rsync outputs - are this all files checked or those to be transferred?
[06:31] <dibblego> how do I find out what graphics driver I am using?
[06:31] <sn9> phrontist: http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/conspire/2006-June/002071.html
[06:33] <Ferret_> Woot just managed to get into the installer. Les' see how this pans out.
[06:33] <phrontist> sn9: thanks!
[06:33] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, i has find it: patch-2.6.18-rt1, patch-2.6.18-rt2, patch-2.6.18-rt3, patch-2.6.18-rt4, patch-2.6.18-rt5, patch-2.6.18-rt6, patch-2.6.18-rt7
[06:33] <Jordan_U> Ferret_: :)
[06:34] <crimsun> KnowledgEngi: now apply them and reconfigure
[06:35] <phrontist> sn9: what did that do, exactly?
[06:35] <phrontist> I don't seem to have easyubuntu...
[06:35] <KnowledgEngi> i must appliy 7 patchs ???
[06:35] <sn9> phrontist: the next messages in that mailing list thread talk about what it does
[06:36] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun,  i must appliy all 7 patchs ???
[06:36] <phrontist> sn9: wow, that is magic
[06:37] <tamale> crazy question.. but how do I make X start up automatically on my server install of dapper drake?  :)
[06:37] <tamale> typing startx works fine
[06:37] <tamale> i just need it to do that at bootup
[06:37] <Kr0ntab> tamale, did you install gdm?
[06:37] <Jordan_U> tamale: Have you installed gdm?
[06:37] <tamale> pretty sure I did.
[06:37] <sn9> phrontist: easier than easyubuntu. now i just need to update it for edgy...
[06:37] <Ferret_> Thanks for the help :> I'm gonna go see if I can get this thing to do my  bidding.
[06:37] <tamale> gdm is in the /etc/init.d scripts at least
[06:37] <eyequeue> tam, x on a server??  but sudo apt-get install gdm
[06:38] <tamale> eyequeue: I have a couple programs that only work through wine
[06:38] <phrontist> sn9: after restarting firefox, I still don't seem to have flash though
[06:38] <Kr0ntab> $ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start       to test it out.
[06:38] <spunconfuse_> Can someone help me mount my usb memory stick reader?
[06:38] <Jordan_U> tamale: apt-get install gdm just to check
[06:38] <tamale> and i want to be able to control them remotely
[06:38] <tamale> k
[06:38] <tamale> yup already latest version
[06:39] <sn9> phrontist: it installs flash 7. i've been contemplating changing it to install flash 9 instead
[06:39] <eyequeue> tam, man update-rc.d if it doesn;t seem to be starting at boot btw
[06:39] <eyequeue> tamale, rather ^^
[06:39] <tamale> uhh
[06:39] <tamale> what? lol
[06:39] <Jordan_U> tamale: and : sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[06:39] <Jordan_U> ?
[06:39] <tamale> lemme try to explain the process that works first
[06:40] <tamale> this server is with me for now
[06:40] <tamale> but tomorrow it's going in a datacenter
[06:40] <tamale> when i reboot it now, i get a normal vga terminal asking for me to login
[06:40] <mbb> anyone know how to edit the text on the main panel? I want to change "Applications" to "Apps" as I'm running out of space
[06:40] <eyequeue> tamale, , man update-rc.d tells you how to change the at-boot or not aspect of gdm (or others in /etc/init.d)
[06:40] <Kr0ntab> tamale,   issue the command" sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
[06:40] <tamale> i can log in and it works fine, and then i can type start x and x loads.   at that point, i can use VNC from my other computers
[06:40] <tamale> k
[06:40] <glick> hey is there a reason why i cant hear sounds when i watch videos on google vids or youtube?
[06:40] <glick> anyone else have that prob?
[06:41] <glick> with firefoxy?
[06:41] <phrontist> glick: you probably don't have flash
[06:41] <Jordan_U> !flash9 | glick
[06:41] <glick> flash?
[06:41] <ubotu> glick: You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[06:41] <eyequeue> tamale, remember to put sudo in front of any update-rc.d command you may need
[06:41] <tamale> k
[06:41] <Jordan_U> glick: Flash 7 is a sound nightmare, go with 9 even though it is beta.
[06:42] <glick> Jordan_U, where do i get 9?
[06:42] <phrontist> ubotu: I don't see 9
[06:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about I don't see 9 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:42] <Jordan_U> phrontist: ubotu is a bot :)
[06:42] <bimberi> mbb: Swap that applet for a "Main Menu" applet which only uses the Icon
[06:42] <tamale> the problem is that if i'm not in front of the machine and only logged in with ssh, i can't use "start x", it obviously fails
[06:42] <phrontist> Jordan_U: I've failed the turing test :-)
[06:43] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to install lilo over grub?
[06:43] <Jordan_U> glick: Do you know how to add repositories?
[06:43] <glick> Jordan_U, yeah
[06:43] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun, patch-2.6.18-rt1, patch-2.6.18-rt2, patch-2.6.18-rt3, patch-2.6.18-rt4, patch-2.6.18-rt5, patch-2.6.18-rt6, patch-2.6.18-rt7
[06:43] <KnowledgEngi> i must to apply all 7 patchs ????
[06:43] <Jordan_U> glick: Add the repo on that page and install flashplayer-nonfree
[06:44] <sn9> ...and i just fixed my firefox!
[06:44] <palomer> how do I force cp to always overwrite?
[06:44] <KnowledgEngi> or patch-2.6.18-rt3 is for linux-2-6-18-3 ??
[06:44] <palomer> cp -f doesn't do it!
[06:44] <Jordan_U> sn9: how?
[06:44] <KnowledgEngi> or patch-2.6.18-rt3 is for linux-2.6.18.3 ??
[06:45] <sn9> Jordan_U: installed firefox-ubuntu-themes and changed the theme from the default
[06:45] <Kr0ntab> tamale, thats ok.  if you issue start gdm via the init.d script... you can simply check if it's started by doing "ps -ef | grep gdm"
[06:45] <Kr0ntab> if it's started successfully... you'll see it.
[06:46] <tamale> Kr0ntab: So, from a remote machine, I should be able to ssh in, start gdm, then use VNC ?
[06:46] <Kr0ntab> correct...
[06:46] <tamale> Kr0ntab: Awesome, I'll try that now.
[06:46] <eyequeue> tamale, semi-correct at least :)
[06:46] <Jordan_U> palomer: --remove-destination I think, man cp
[06:46] <palomer> tried it
[06:46] <Kr0ntab> if you want to use VNC you can... or you can just check to see if the processes are running with the ps command
[06:46] <palomer> always tried -f
[06:46] <palomer> both don't work
[06:47] <Eclypse> this is kinda off-topic, but I can't find an alternative proxy server for my windows desktop, I've used proxy plus but it just stopped working out of nowhere . . . and I've been through a lot to try to fix it . . . so if anyone has any off hand suggestions I would greatly appriciate it
[06:47] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to fix a mounted ntfs partition that I messed up while trying to fix grub?
[06:47] <mbb> bimberi: Thanks, just what I wanted! Do you also know how to turn off the tooltips that appear when you hover over an applet icon?
[06:47] <rickyfingers> Kr0ntab: if he's ssh'ing in from another linux box, why not just ssh -X? I'm asking because I don't really know much about vnc.
[06:47] <eyequeue> tamale, you have to have allowed such remote access of course :)  if TCP 6001 or whatever it is is blocked, or not enabled, it won't connect
[06:47] <Shadow_mil> How do I set line in as my capture device?
[06:48] <sn9> Jordan_U: never mind -- still crashes
[06:48] <tamale> eyequeue: that SHOULDN'T be a problem.. but thanks for the reminder :)
[06:48] <Kr0ntab> vnc is typically run as a remote desktop app... so he can see whats actually being viewed.
[06:48] <Jordan_U> sn9: When you removed it to re install did you -purge ?
[06:48] <eyequeue> tamale, no prob, are you testing it tonight?  let us know progress :)
[06:48] <tamale> the purpose of VNC is because as a server, we're going to be running a few apps that only work using wine
[06:48] <glick> whats the flash 9 package called
[06:48] <tamale> yah it's rebooting right now
[06:48] <Kr0ntab> ssh -X is just X11 forwarding to run specific apps on the remote machine, but displayed on yours.
[06:48] <tamale> almost back up
[06:49] <sn9> Jordan_U: yes
[06:49] <tamale> Kr0ntab: OK!! that's what i wanted to know about
[06:49] <tamale> i hear about this stuff about x servers
=== Guest706 is now known as Guest007
[06:49] <tamale> and i figure if i just tell startx to start in the right display, that would work too...
[06:49] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to fix a mounted ntfs partition that I messed up while trying to fix grub?
[06:49] <Jordan_U> tamale: And those wine apps have GUI's?
[06:49] <tamale> Jordan_U: Correct.. only a gui.. there'd be no way to run them through a CLI
[06:49] <bimberi> mbb: /apps/panel/global,tooltips_enabled in gconf-editor
[06:49] <Kr0ntab> yeah.. its just single apps...
[06:49] <glick> it cant find flashplayer-nonfree and i added the repo
[06:49] <Eclypse> this is kinda off-topic, but I can't find an alternative proxy server for my windows desktop, I've used proxy plus but it just stopped working out of nowhere . . . and I've been through a lot to try to fix it . . . so if anyone has any off hand suggestions I would greatly appriciate it
[06:50] <Jordan_U> glick: My bad, plugin not player
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> crimsun,
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> I need to apply real time patch to the kernel. I has find it:
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> patch-2.6.18-rt1, patch-2.6.18-rt2, patch-2.6.18-rt3, patch-2.6.18-rt4, patch-2.6.18-rt5, patch-2.6.18-rt6, patch-2.6.18-rt7
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> I must apply all 7 putchs ??
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> or rt1 is for linux-2.6.18.1
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> and rt2 is for linux-2.6.18.2
[06:50] <KnowledgEngi> and rtN is for linux-2.6.18.N
[06:50] <tamale> man lol.. ubuntu takes forever to boot!
[06:51] <Eclypse> tamale, it isn't that bad.
[06:51] <Jordan_U> tamale: Not Edgy :)
[06:51] <Eclypse> try windows xp loaded with a fuckload (excuse the french) of spyware ;)
[06:51] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to fix a mounted ntfs partition that I messed up while trying to fix grub?
[06:51] <Guest007> tamale: you suck
[06:51] <Eclypse> Guest007 you suck.
[06:51] <TaeBo-> 2nd'd
[06:51] <avenger__> sup?
[06:51] <Jordan_U> tamale: But how often do you need to reboot in linux?
[06:51] <Guest007> Oh did i say that out loaud? sorry tamale
[06:51] <tamale> hopefully never :)
[06:51] <Eclypse> Guest007 oh you're soo clever.
[06:51] <tamale> k i'm in.. i'll login and try starting gdm
[06:51] <rickyfingers> TaeBo: what do you mean by "messed up"
[06:51] <glick> Jordan_U, i only see the 7 one, and it says installed
[06:52] <avenger__> ok
[06:52] <Eclypse> anyone know a good proxy server app for windows off the top of their head?
[06:52] <Guest007> tahnks Eclypse, as you are
[06:52] <Jordan_U> glick: you ran: sudo apt-get update ?
[06:52] <TaeBo-> rickyfingers: It nolonger mounts properly and asks me if I installed the correct plugin when I look at it in gparted
[06:52] <malt> Eclypse Tor
[06:52] <Eclypse> Guest007, I'll just ignore the subtle insults and take that as a complement, thanks man.
[06:52] <Eclypse> malt, Tor?
[06:52] <thirdalbum> I know this sounds like a stupid question, but can a 64-bit OS be run on a 32-bit machine?
[06:52] <Eclypse> malt, I think I've heard about that, actually.
[06:53] <Eclypse> Malt, thanks
[06:53] <Guest007> you bet dude
[06:53] <malt> Eclypse: what are you going to be using it for?
[06:53] <Jordan_U> thirdalbum: No.
[06:53] <Eclypse> malt, sharing dialup with a laptop through a wireless router.
[06:53] <sn9> thirdalbum: only in emulation
[06:53] <mbb> bimberi: Thank you yet again. That's at least 3 solutions you've had!
[06:53] <panji_alam> hi everybody
[06:53] <Eclypse> malt, proxy plus worked but then it suddenly stopped working.

[06:53] <malt> is this lan?
[06:53] <bimberi> mbb: np :)
[06:53] <thirdalbum> Jordan_U and sn9: Thanks. I've had this computer since May and I've only just discovered it's 64-bit, by running the 64-bit Live CD :-)
[06:53] <tamale> oh man!!!
[06:53] <Eclypse> malt, nothing else has worked so far.
[06:53] <Jordan_U> glick: You need to add the pgp key...
[06:53] <tamale> it works perfectly
[06:54] <tamale> i love you guys
[06:54] <Kr0ntab> w0rd...
[06:54] <Kr0ntab> hehe
[06:54] <tamale> hahaha
[06:54] <tamale> no really though
[06:54] <tamale> this is great
[06:54] <tamale> it will always be secure when it first reboots..
[06:54] <tamale> just waiting for a login
[06:54] <malt> A proxy server can go offline and get very laggy, most people use a proxy server to throw all there internet traffic through it, and to hide there ip address
[06:54] <tamale> but when I login over ssh and start gdm, i can then vnc in
[06:54] <sn9> glick: did you add the key for seveas?
[06:54] <Eclypse> malt, what else do you suggest I use?
[06:54] <tamale> can i stop gdm in the exacy same way ?
[06:54] <phxheat> hi, i would like beryl to startup everytime i log into gnome, however the sessions -> startup programs section is not saving my command when i leave the window... anyone know why?

[06:55] <malt> Eclypse: are you doing this on lan?
[06:55] <Eclypse> malt, yes.
[06:55] <Eclypse> malt, my router is a PoS tho,
[06:55] <Jordan_U> eyequeue: Most people running servers like having LTS.
[06:55] <eyequeue> Jordan_U, yeah, so i would think
[06:55] <Eclypse> malt, so I can't really do much to make it more flexible . . .
[06:56] <malt> Can't you get a router with lan speeds at 100mbps+?
[06:56] <Olathe> How do I start up so that I can properly run fsck ?
[06:56] <malt> why not do that and network the computers togeather
[06:56] <glick> ok i added the repos, i added the keys, i still only see flashplugin 7
[06:56] <Eclypse> malt, the computers ARE networked together
[06:56] <Eclypse> malt, I'm trying to share the dialup internet.
[06:56] <Eclypse> malt, and I have done it
[06:56] <TaeBo-> Can I change sessions for example to xgl from gnome without logging out?
[06:56] <malt> If its lan you can share files without even having internet access
[06:56] <eyequeue> Olathe, typically, boot from the alternate cd, or similar
[06:56] <Olathe> Alright, thanks.
[06:56] <malt> on lan
[06:56] <Eclypse> malt, proxy plus refuses to work now for some reason
[06:57] <Jordan_U> Olathe: Use a liveCD :) ( looking for the boot parameter... )
[06:57] <Eclypse> malt, I know that . . .
[06:57] <Eclypse> malt, I WANT to share internet with my laptop
[06:57] <malt> Eclypse: are you wanting to share files over the internet?
[06:57] <Eclypse> malt, no
[06:57] <Eclypse> malt, I want to share internet with my laptop
[06:57] <Eclypse> malt, very simple concept
[06:57] <malt> Eclypse: oh
[06:57] <malt> get a wireless router?
[06:57] <Kr0ntab> glick, paste your /etc/apt/sources.list in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[06:58] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: run firestarter on machine that's already connected to the internet
[06:58] <Eclypse> malt, have a wireless router . . .
[06:58] <Eclypse> rickyfingers what's firestarter?
[06:58] <malt> is it not finding the network Eclypse?
[06:58] <malt> the laptop
[06:58] <sky123> i believe he said dial up
[06:58] <eyequeue> Eclypse, try stating it with different words.  do you want the laptop to act as a gateway?  do you want some other machine to act as a gateway with the laptop behind it?
[06:58] <Eclypse> malt, the network works absolutly perfectly, computers detect, files shar eperfectly, it all /works/
[06:58] <eyequeue> firestarter (8)      - program to manage and observe firewalls
[06:58] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: maby I don't have your situation understood properly, you have a wireless router that you want to get the laptop working with

[06:59] <rickyfingers> dibblego: lspci
[06:59] <bimberi> dibblego: lspci
[06:59] <malt> Eclypse: dial up is slow enough why try to run it through a proxy?

[06:59] <dibblego> 0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 7145
[06:59] <darkbishop> where can i find a codec to play avi format?
[06:59] <Eclypse> malt, wow, why ask such an irrelevent question?
[06:59] <eyequeue> dibblego, dmesg | less, and look through it
[06:59] <TaeBo-> AVI has many different formats
[07:00] <TaeBo-> AVI just means audio video interlace
[07:00] <dibblego> eyequeue, for what exactly?
[07:00] <malt> Eclypse. I'm not
[07:00] <Eclypse> ima just stop here so I don't get banned
[07:00] <Eclypse> anyways
[07:00] <Kr0ntab> glick... instead of custom at the end of that sevease line.... use "all"
[07:00] <Eclypse> leme rephraise
[07:00] <glick> ok
[07:00] <darkbishop> the extantion is *.avi
[07:00] <Kr0ntab> seveas I mean
[07:00] <malt> Eclypse are you wanting to act as a proxy server?
[07:00] <eyequeue> dibblego, no idea what your video card is, but some keyword from it
[07:00] <Eclypse> malt, I'll explain hold on
[07:00] <malt> ok
[07:00] <sky123> Eclypse: restate it...I think they are missing it
[07:00] <armstrong80> are there default setting in ubuntu that are preventing people from uploading from me p2p? (they can connect but barely download, 0.2-0.7 kb few second pulses) Its very odd
[07:01] <TaeBo-> darkbishop: VLC will play just about anything without extra codecs
[07:01] <Jordan_U> armstrong80: More likely your router.
[07:01] <glick> cool thanks Kr0ntab
[07:01] <Kr0ntab> np
[07:01] <darkbishop> Taebo:do VLC come with ubuntu...just wondering?
[07:01] <armstrong80> Jordan U: I connect directly to the modem
[07:01] <luddite> hey all, how do i insmod the usb module for ubuntu sound
[07:01] <TaeBo-> Darkbishop: not sure, I think it came with mine in edgy
[07:01] <Jordan_U> darkbishop: You can install it.
[07:02] <luddite> is there an package i eed?
[07:02] <Jordan_U> darkbishop: It is not installed by default
[07:02] <Kr0ntab> glick, that work out for you?
[07:02] <darkbishop> jordan_u:but its in the cd rite??
[07:02] <TaeBo-> Darkbishop: Press alt+F2 then type vlc
[07:02] <Jordan_U> darkbishop: No.
[07:02] <glick> yeah Kr0ntab
[07:02] <Eclypse> malt, my desktop, which is running windows, is connected to a wireless router, and my laptop connects to that wireless router. my desktop is to act as a proxy server in which I can share my dialup internet with my laptop.  no computers outside my LAN.  I used proxy plus to share my internet with my laptop (and it worked quite well, but it suddenly stopped working for MSN Messenger and other services . . . but web browsing still works, so basically, I wan
[07:02] <Eclypse> t a replacement for proxy plus that is capable of working through my router, ICS never worked through my router so I started using the proxy.
[07:03] <Eclypse> damn I ohpe that explains everything.
[07:03] <glick> yay! sound!
[07:03] <darkbishop> lemme check and get back to you guys
=== ar is now known as Sapote
[07:03] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: try firestarter
[07:04] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, what exactly will it do?
[07:04] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: it's easy to use (gui) and it has internet connection sharing built in
[07:04] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to get a windows install to boot with grub, when it says ntldr not found, after installing edgy?
[07:04] <malt> Eclypse: ok if you are running a desktop and proxy server is on, try proxycap and just set the the proxy server information in it and your set
[07:04] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: it also will run dhcp server to the wireless router
[07:04] <Jordan_U> Please, is there any way to get this video to play in Ubuntu http://www.nbc.com/Video/rewind/full_episodes/?show=heroes ?
[07:04] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: makes everything easy.
[07:04] <BeanBag> There is a program called fysh or something simular that can be used to help learn all the commands in terminal. Does anyone know about it and where can i get it?
[07:04] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, I don't use DCHP
[07:05] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, static works much better.
[07:05] <malt> Eclypse: it has a setting where you can tunnel anything that trys to use the internet through proxy
[07:05] <malt> so then you don't have to set each
[07:05] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: I'm just listing what you can do with it
[07:05] <malt> with proxy setting
[07:05] <Eclypse> malt, sweet, can you link me? (i'm on dialup)
[07:05] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, ah ok
[07:05] <lpxlmdk> help plz? i just tried to set up dual monitors and my xorg.conf_backup isn't there i thot i made it!!
[07:05] <malt> Eclpse -> http://proxylabs.netwu.com/
[07:05] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, I'll try yours next if malt's doesn't work, his sounds better at the moment.
[07:05] <lpxlmdk> is there a way i can recreate it somehow? i'm on the live CD right now..
[07:05] <soulfire41> is there a channel for ubuntu on IA64?
[07:06] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: one very important detail: the machine that connects directly to dial up is running ubuntu, right?
[07:06] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, no.
[07:06] <darkbishop> nope i dont have vlc..
[07:06] <Jordan_U> lpxlmdk: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh

[07:06] <darkbishop> thx guys.....
[07:06] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, as I stated, it's running windows.
[07:07] <Eclypse> rickyfingers, I used to use ubuntu, and I know this is a good community, that's why I'm here.
[07:07] <malt> Eclypse: you already have proxy server running right?
[07:07] <rickyfingers> Eclypse: internet connection sharing doesn't work?
[07:07] <Eclypse> malt, eh, what do you mean?
[07:07] <lpxlmdk> thanks jordan, just reboot and try that right? or can i just do it in terminal now??
[07:07] <Eclypse> rickyfingers not through my router sadly, it worked well when I didn't have the router :P
[07:07] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Went back to vanilla debian ?
[07:07] <darkbishop> help on configuring wine?
[07:07] <asdx> how do i install the nvidia drivers?
[07:07] <Eclypse> Jordan_U, nah, went back to Vista, I like good battery life :P
[07:08] <malt> ok proxycap is a proxy program that lets you add proxys to it, and once you have got it set your proxy server ip and port, you can just choose to tunnel all your traffic through the proxy

[07:08] <Parisi> ah Vista.
[07:08] <Eclypse> malt hmm . . .

[07:08] <Eclypse> Parisi yeah that's not one of it's higher points . . . lol
[07:08] <soulfire41> EFI is the BIOS system
[07:09] <Eclypse> Jordan_U everyone in this community knows that ubuntu sucks for battery life.
[07:09] <eyequeue> soulfire41, did you check compare the d/l'd md5 to the website?
[07:09] <soulfire41> i never have found an MD5
[07:09] <Eclypse> Jordan_U I get 2 hours less in ubuntu then I do in Vista, with all it's little gadgets turned on and everything
[07:09] <luddite> i get 4 hours or more
[07:09] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Except me, seriously, had no idea. I don't use windows.
[07:09] <luddite> sometimes 6 with no wifi
[07:09] <luddite> sounds like your laptop is crap
[07:09] <luddite> sorry
[07:09] <Eclypse> malt, so proxycap is merely something that would work through Proxy Plus? is it for the client or the server?
[07:09] <Parisi> Eclypse Tell me about it, one i can only hope it will be tweaked before the official release date, this thing is pushing my amd  dual core 3800xp to its limits.
[07:09] <Kr0ntab> Eclypse, I'd say that hat depends entirely on the ACPI support, and effective use of CPU scaling or other power saving settings....
[07:10] <Eclypse> Jordan_U ah, do you have a laptoP?
[07:10] <malt> Eclypse: for example if you already got proxy server running on your desktop with ip lets say 66.204.255.2 and port 6634, then you would go to proxycap and add proxy and add ip 66.204.255.2 and port 6634 and you would just choose to tunnel all your traffic
[07:10] <rickyfingers> soulfire41: how old's the box you're trying to install ubuntu on?
[07:10] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Did you set ubuntu for better battery life over performance? Yes I do.
[07:10] <Eclypse> Parisi, I never tried the beta, I used the official RTM version (thesame ver that's going to be released in 2 months)
[07:10] <luddite> ubuntu does an awesome job with powermanagement out of hte box install
[07:10] <soulfire41> it was first sold in 2000
[07:10] <Parisi> Eclypse Ubuntu wont even load properly on this machine, thats the sad part.
[07:10] <Eclypse> Jordan_U I tried everything, trust me

[07:11] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: An OS can't just suck energy into a black whole, there must be something it is doing differently to make it use more power.
[07:11] <Eclypse> malt, so is it it's own proxy server or what? it seems like an add on to what proxy plus already does? lol
[07:11] <soulfire41> No it is a HP zx2000 running on Intel Itanium 2
[07:12] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Do you have a dual core machine?
[07:12] <Eclypse> Jordan_U the video drivers suck balls.

[07:13] <malt> Eclypse: you want socks server?
[07:13] <soulfire41> the iso i have is Debian 31 R 3 business card
[07:13] <Eclypse> malt, well that's a fat load of bullshit, it's not free
[07:13] <Eclypse> malt, I don't think I'll ever need socks
[07:13] <soulfire41> I thought it was Ubuntu
[07:13] <soulfire41> i wonder what i did with that ISO
[07:13] <malt> Eclypse: there is serial sites :P
[07:14] <Eclypse> Jordan_U well, this video card runs Aero perfectly so I'm content
[07:14] <Eclypse> malt yeah, true
[07:14] <Eclypse> malt, either way, you seemed like you were going at something else
[07:14] <spunconfuse_> what file system does a floppy use?
[07:14] <luddite> hey all, how do insmod audio drivers for usb device microphone
[07:14] <luddite> kind of stumped
[07:15] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: My intel integrated graphics card from 3 years ago runs Beryl with all the snazzy effects enabled, so I am content :)
[07:15] <malt> Eclypse: yeah proxycap is on a proxy client, i thought you already had proxy server running on your desktop and you were looking for a client to connect to that proxy on your laptop
[07:15] <TheGino_Frank> how does one keep totem-Mozilla and firefox up to date through Synaptic, is it automatic?
[07:15] <synjet> hi.. anybody able to get skype working on Edgy? I get "Problem with sound device" error, and as suggested in forums, tried changing to ALSA etc, but invain! any ideas?
[07:15] <Eclypse> Jordan_U even blur with wobbly windows? ;)
[07:15] <darkbishop> guys.. its work.. vlc do play anything.. thx guys... ur the greatest
[07:15] <IndyGUnFreak> where do you even download skype?
[07:15] <darkbishop> i can watch bleach now
[07:15] <Jordan_U> TheGino_Frank: it is automatic.
[07:16] <tamale> www.skype.com  ?
[07:16] <synjet> skpye has deb repos
[07:16] <Eclypse> malt, yea I need a new proxy server, unless we can figure out what just made mine suddenly stop working
[07:16] <TheGino_Frank> Jordan_U, thanks
[07:16] <IndyGUnFreak> i was trying to find it int he repos and couldn't
[07:16] <Eclypse> malt, see, I thought it was Vista's problem, so I ended up formatting vista and installed xp, and tehn found out that XP has a problem with it TOO!
[07:16] <Eclypse> malt, and this has been troubling me for atleast 5 days now
[07:16] <Jordan_U> Eclypse: Blur isn't even a real blur effect, it is some ghosting awfull looking thing that I never enable :)
[07:17] <synjet> skype.com/linux I guess.. ubuntuguide.org suggested to add download.skype.com/repos/debian/ stable non-free
[07:17] <Eclypse> Jordan_U blur looked real to me when I used it . . .
[07:17] <TaeBo-> Jordan_UL blur looks and works great on my rig
[07:17] <Eclypse> Jordan_U I can't see why it wouldn't be, it lagged my laptop liek hell
[07:18] <soulfire41> hey..anyone know where i should go to get the Edgy release of Ubuntu for IA64, as ISO?
[07:18] <Eclypse> malt, any idea's?
[07:18] <dope> is there a way to set my default text editor?
[07:18] <Jordan_U> TaeBo-: Eclypse: what I mean is that it isn't a real motion blur, it just has the ghost of previous frames which IMHO looks horrible.
[07:18] <malt> Eclypse: would you be ok to use a socks server?
[07:18] <TaeBo-> Jordan_U I understand what you mean, I guess I am not perceptive enough to notice
[07:19] <nub_> i have a somewhat advanced question for you guys
[07:19] <synjet> so.. anybody got successful with skype? just wondering..
[07:19] <Eclypse> malt, that would be terribly ineffecient . . . I'd rather not
[07:19] <malt> Eclypse: are you wanting only http?
[07:19] <malt> or socks and http?
[07:19] <Eclypse> malt, I want one that supports HTTP and FTP
[07:19] <malt> socks can
[07:19] <Eclypse> malt, proxy plus supports socks, ftp, http, and all that
[07:20] <Eclypse> malt, and it's free, which amazes me actually
[07:20] <nub_> what i want to do is this: i want to install linux on my slave drive, but not put grub on the master. i want to use my BIOS menu to select which drive i boot from, so that if i take the ubuntu drive out, it doesn't affect my windows drive. is this doable?
[07:20] <malt> Eclypse: maybe your problem is your ip changed?
[07:20] <malt> and your putting in wrong proxy information on laptop
[07:20] <malt> ?
[07:20] <Eclypse> malt nope, this is static, and they're all the same IP's
[07:20] <Parisi> nub. yes.
[07:20] <Eclypse> malt, nope.
[07:20] <malt> hmmm
[07:20] <Jordan_U> nub_: Yes, it is easiest with a grub floppy.
[07:20] <gop> hello
[07:20] <gop>  how does one get to switch themes in fvwm in ubuntu
[07:20] <Eclypse> malt, mystery to me as well . . .
[07:20] <soulfire41> Hey...how come there are no IA64 Ubuntu ISO's downloadable for the Ubuntu web site?
[07:21] <nub_> i don't have a floppy drive, jordan
[07:21] <K^Holtz> I am having many issues with Gnome right now.. I just upgraded to Edgy, and now im getting Gnome Daemon errors
[07:21] <nub_> parisi: how would i go about it?
[07:21] <gop> just got fvwm installed but trying to learn
[07:21] <Jordan_U> nub_: Still possible.
[07:21] <gop> is thier a simple way to switch themes
[07:21] <nub_> is there a howto somewhere on the web?
[07:21] <Jordan_U> Goodnight all
[07:21] <gop> I check the website hmm no how to
[07:22] <feross> gop: try fvwm-crystal... it's awsome
[07:22] <Guest007> goodnite Jordan_U
[07:22] <K^Holtz> There was an error starting the Gnome Settings Daemon. The last error message was The name org.gnome.SettingsDaemon was not provided by any .service files   [Thats what pops up in the dialog box] 
[07:22] <nub_> yeah, i checked to forums already
[07:22] <Jordan_U> !grub
[07:22] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[07:22] <Eclypse> malt, anymore idea's?
[07:22] <K^Holtz> I noticed that Raid devices are failing to load at startup
[07:22] <dope> is there a way to set my default text editor?
[07:22] <malt> Eclypse: do you have aim?
[07:22] <Eclypse> malt, no, just MSN
[07:22] <malt> I can try to help you, I'm gooling proxy servers
[07:22] <malt> that is free
[07:23] <Parisi> you could always just let grub do its magic and if needed you could always remove it  restoring it back to normal by wiping the mbr.
[07:23] <Eclypse> malt, which is also what's not working . . .
[07:23] <vintle> Anyone know what the best daemon is to install for hosting a chat server in ubuntu?
[07:23] <malt> ok add me Eclypse newport9756@yahoo.com is my msn
[07:23] <nub_> yeah, but that's a little bit more work than i'm up for right now. i'm just trying out WINE and the wacom drivers, i want to replace windows
[07:23] <asdx> what is the nvidia driver package name? nvidia-drivers?
[07:23] <nub_> nvidia-glx i think
[07:24] <Parisi> nub_ Well, you could skip grub and do exactly what you said, it will probably work, just not very convenient.
[07:24] <gop> feross,  how do I go by installing that
[07:24] <nub_> i don't have to install grub?
[07:24] <gop> jabber nub_
[07:24] <Eclypse> malt, added.
[07:24] <malt> Eclypse: no wait newport9786@yahoo.com
[07:24] <malt> I think thats it been so long
[07:25] <Parisi> nub_ I could also use a floppy to boot the kernel, not sure how to go about with Ubuntu tho, i always let grub do the work for me, i also run dual HD's.
[07:25] <gop> !fvwm-theme
[07:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fvwm-theme - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:25] <gop> !fvwm
[07:25] <Lancellor> http://lt.k1011.nutime.de/     what do you guys think about this is Linux Mint 2.0 base onUbuntu
[07:25] <ubotu> fvwm: F(?) Virtual Window Manager, version 2.5. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:2.5.16-2 (edgy), package size 2927 kB, installed size 6512 kB
[07:25] <feross> gop:  http://polishlinux.org/apps/fvwm-crystal-speed-and-transparency/
[07:25] <nub_> i think i'll just do it the default way, and restore the windows mbr if needed. sounds like a lot less hassle.
[07:25] <feross> nub_: hold a sec
[07:25] <nub_> feross: ok
[07:26] <feross> nub_: if you take the windows drive out, make the ubuntu drive primary.. install ubuntu and grub into mbr... then set up as slave and now you should be able to switch between the two without probs
[07:26] <Parisi> nub_ Yes, thats correct, in order to restore the mbr just boot using a windows disk and issue fdisk /mbr on the command prompt, that should do the trick. That is assuming you install grub on the MBR
[07:27] <K^Holtz> Can someone please help me? My Gnome isnt loading all the way it seems.. I have blue titlebars and stuff.. I keep getting this Bug Buddy popping up, and it wont go away...
[07:27] <Guest007> Parisi, he said he doesn't have a floppy
[07:27] <nub_> windows comes on a cd now, lol
[07:27] <Parisi> Gues, dont need it, use a windows CD
[07:27] <Guest007> heh, lol sorry
[07:28] <nub_> i haven't used a floppy drive since i got a computer that could boot from cd
[07:28] <Parisi> heh.
[07:28] <feross> nub_: just edit the grub mentu.lst to whatever it is that it needs to point to once you make it a slave..
[07:29] <gop> feross,  is this supported in ubuntu
[07:29] <feross> nub_: could also use a usb stickto boot
[07:29] <nub_> i'll have to figure it out. i didn't know you didn't have to install grub on the primary master.
[07:29] <Parisi> If you happen to install grub on the seconday drive you might not be able to boot from it, you may have to set a bootable flag on it.
[07:29] <Parisi> Thats why i wouldnt recomend moving anything.
[07:30] <nub_> yeah, i'll just do it the default way, heh
[07:30] <nub_> i don't like config files much
[07:30] <Parisi> Moving as in replacing drives and cables.
[07:30] <feross> gop: it's very safe
[07:30] <pxlmdk> hi im trying to restore my xorg.conf cuz i tried to set up dual monitors and it didn't work.. how can i reconfigure this file please?
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:30] <gop> is thier like a simple apt-get install blah
[07:30] <nub_> i'm far more comfortable messing around with my hardware than i am with software
[07:30] <Parisi> Worst thing that grub can do is corrupt your mbr, but thats easy to fix.
[07:31] <TheGino_Frank> Whats the difference between Metacity themes and GTK 2.x themes?
[07:31] <feross> gop: it's all of four steps to get it going :) common
[07:31] <nub_> i hope that i will be able to delete windows entirely
[07:31] <Parisi> nub_ What are you trying to do?
[07:31] <gop> so does the website tell me the four steps
[07:31] <nub_> right now, i'm trying ubuntu out for some things
[07:31] <feross> yes, you have to scroll about half way down
[07:31] <Parisi> Ah, ok.
[07:31] <nub_> i want to know if WINE is working for the games i want to play, and i want to know if these wacom bluetooth drivers work
[07:32] <gop> sudo apt-get install fvwm python imagemagick rox-filer\
[07:32] <gop>  xscreensaver trayer gksu aterm habak mpd mpc is this the command
[07:32] <Parisi> So far i like Vista > Ubuntu
[07:32] <nub_> if i get that working to my satisfaction, the likelihood is that i'll ditch xp
[07:32] <K^Holtz> what is a command to do all upgrade through terminal?
[07:32] <K^Holtz> upgrades*
[07:32] <feross> gop: yes that's where you start
[07:32] <Parisi> Ya, i have ditched XP for the most part, but Vista has kept me happy.
[07:32] <nub_> yeah, but i make $7 an hour, so ubuntu is the choice for me
[07:32] <Parisi> nub_ Ya, i hear you
[07:33] <Parisi> Ubuntu wont even run on my machine properly, its a shame.
[07:33] <pip> Hello
[07:34] <nub_> with the stupidly high price of vista coupled with how little it will add to most people's experience, i smell a large exodus to linux
[07:34] <Parisi> My next experiment is osx x86 on my Intel PC
[07:34] <Viper> hi
[07:34] <nub_> i figure i might want to get used to it now
[07:34] <Viper> i need help
[07:34] <Viper> i'm completely new to Ubuntu
[07:34] <Viper> i've never used linux in my life
[07:34] <Viper> how do i use it?
[07:34] <Parisi> nub_ Vista has a quite a few new featuresm you would be surprised, i could care less since i am getting a free upgrade.
[07:35] <Flannel> !ask | Viper
[07:35] <ubotu> Viper: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:35] <TheGino_Frank> Whats the difference between Metacity themes and GTK 2.x themes???
[07:35] <Flannel> Er, more like... ask specific questions.  What would you like to do?
[07:35] <Viper> where is the console in ubuntu
[07:35] <Parisi> nub_ Ubuntu is a fine OS, just not polished enough for everyday use, at least not for me.
[07:35] <Viper> i wanted to install beryl with aigls on ubuntu 6.10
[07:35] <Flannel> Viper: there's a few ways to get to it.  If you just want to run a command, ctrl-f2 brings up a run sort of thing, or theres "terminal" in accessories
[07:35] <pip> my ubutnu installer could not read the partition table ,any ideas ? is the partition table broken or something else ? But the truth is ,windows on my hard disk can start normally!
[07:36] <Flannel> Viper: for beryl, you'll want to ask in #ubuntu-xgl, they'll be able to help
[07:36] <Viper> ok
[07:36] <nub_> what's beryl?
[07:36] <ArrenLex> !beryl
[07:36] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[07:36] <Viper> what about questions for kiba-dock
[07:37] <Flannel> Viper: Is it included in ubuntu? (Ive never heard of it)
[07:37] <Viper> it looks something like the mac docs
[07:38] <nub_> ok, it's telling me grub will be installed to (hd0) but i only have hda and hdb on my computer. what gives?
[07:38] <Parisi> I really wanted to like Ubuntu when i bought my newer machine but half of hardware is not even recognized and configured properly.
[07:38] <pip> neither 5.10 nor 6.06 couldn't read the exist partition table ,what shall I do ?
[07:39] <Flannel> nub_: grub uses a different naming scheme than linux, where linux uses hda1 hda2, etc, grub uses only numerals, and starts at 0.  so hd0,0 is hda1, hd1,0 is hdb1, etc
[07:39] <Parisi> nub_ I assume it will install on all HD's ? or its primary master drive?
[07:39] <Parisi> Ah gotcha :)
[07:39] <nub_> ah, ok
[07:39] <nub_> so i could in theory install it to hd1 and force it to boot from that in the bios
[07:40] <nub_> hmm, i like that idea
[07:40] <Parisi> nub, just make sure the drive is bootable tho, sometimes you have to set a bootable flag on it manualy.
[07:40] <nub_> how do i do that?
[07:40] <Flannel> Viper: kiba-dock isn't in ubuntu's repositories, so... you'll need to find something comparable in the repositories (I know there is one, don't know what it's called), or ask the kiba people for support
[07:40] <Parisi> nub, I use fdisk to check its status and enable it.
[07:41] <nub_> what are the commands to do that?
[07:41] <pxlmdk> hi i am trying to reconfigure my xorg.conf.. my backup disappeared or something! can anyone tell me how? right now i can't load xserver..
[07:41] <Parisi> Cant remember exacly from top of my head, just do a fdisk /? or something.
[07:41] <nub_> ok, cool. thanks
[07:42] <nub_> oh, windows fdisk?
[07:42] <ArrenLex> pxlmdk: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:42] <Parisi> That is what i used.
[07:42] <nub_> ok. i didn't even know xp had fdisk
[07:43] <pip> pxlmdk, you lost your xorg.conf file ?
[07:43] <Parisi> nub_ Hmm, i believe so, i do use a Win98 disc so you might wanna check.
[07:43] <eyequeue> Parisi, when fscking "/" you probably want to boot from a cd or something instead, then you'd call the disk-root by some mountpoint name or the like instead
[07:43] <gop> feross,  k so know what
[07:43] <gop> how do I load it
[07:44] <eyequeue> Parisi, i hope that wasn't too unclear
[07:44] <babo> guys, I'm at the download site, but I don't see any links for the live cd ...
[07:44] <gop> got it installed
[07:44] <Parisi> eyequeue It was, come again? :0
[07:44] <Flannel> babo: "desktop" is liveCD
[07:44] <dope> is there a way to set my default text editor?
[07:44] <nub_> babo, all the normal cds are live cds
[07:44] <KrisWood> Hi everyone, I'm trying to install DHCP but it's giving me an error on starup saying I need to add a subnet for my vmnet8 network, which is apparently the vmware ethernet interface, so my question is how do I just get rid of vmware?
[07:44] <babo> k thanks
[07:44] <pip> pxlmdk, you can use live CD and copy the xorg.conf file to your linux partition which is on your harddisk
[07:44] <slavik> there should be a #ubuntu-coding club :D
[07:45] <eyequeue> Parisi, if i want to fsck /dev/hda1, presuming that was my root normally :)  i would boot to a livecd, that way /dev/hda1 isn''t mounted as root :)  then i would fsck from there
[07:46] <Flannel> slavik: that's usually just brought up in #ubuntu-offtopic ;)
[07:46] <dope> is there a way to set my default text editor?
[07:46] <eyequeue> Parisi, any clearer? :)
[07:46] <nub_> dope: system menu, preferences, preferred applications
[07:46] <Parisi> eyequeue, Ya, i mentioned the same procedure, the only difference is i use a Windows 98 boot cd.
[07:46] <slavik> Flannel: I am there :P
[07:46] <dope> thx bro
[07:47] <Parisi> eyequeue Is fskck the same as fdisk ?
[07:47] <eyequeue> Parisi, that threw me off, heh
[07:47] <KnowledgEngi> make prepare
[07:47] <KnowledgEngi> make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install
[07:47] <KnowledgEngi> and make install ???
[07:47] <KnowledgEngi> i must run make install too ???
[07:48] <eyequeue> Parisi, no, FileSystemChecK vs, um, FupyourDislk? heh
[07:48] <Flannel> KnowledgEngi: what are you installing?
[07:48] <feross> gop: I was away, ok did you download the tar.gz and install crystal?
[07:48] <KnowledgEngi> the new stable kernel
[07:48] <KrisWood> does anyone know how to remove vmware?
[07:48] <gop> Fergy,  sure
[07:48] <KnowledgEngi> change the timer parater in the config
[07:48] <Flannel> !kernel | KnowledgEngi
[07:48] <ubotu> KnowledgEngi: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[07:48] <gop> feross,  yes I installed and downloaded
[07:49] <eyequeue> Parisi, fsck finds glitches on your filesystem, say from an improper shutdown or power glitch
[07:49] <gop> feross,  so how do I run it
[07:49] <eyequeue> Parisi, fdisk repartitions your drive
[07:49] <Parisi> eyequeue I see. I guess we are talking about two different things here then, i wanted to check.
[07:49] <nub_> fdisk is a partition manager, eye
[07:49] <Adross> i have a comp running edgy networked to a comp running dapper. What should i do to remote desktop into the dapper one from the edgy box?
[07:49] <gop> feross the install went fine, but how do I run it hm
[07:49] <KrisWood> either that or does anyone know how I can remove the vmnet8 network interface...
[07:49] <Flannel> KrisWood: that depends on how you installed it.  via package management, just remove it.  if you installed from a bin or script, or whatnot, deleting all the files
[07:49] <gop> vnc
[07:49] <feross> gop: you need to put the crystal session file in Xsessions or something like that. THen you log out and go into the options, change session to the one that says foo...
[07:49] <nub_> i second the suggestion for vnc
[07:50] <eyequeue> nub_, yeah, i couldn't think of any f-starting word in it, heh
[07:50] <KnowledgEngi> in the second mirror there is some error Flannel
[07:50] <gop> oh
[07:50] <KrisWood> Flannel I don't remember how I installed it, it was ages ago
[07:50] <KrisWood> how do I tell if there's a package installed?
[07:50] <gop> feross, sudo cp /usr/local/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm I did this
[07:50] <KnowledgEngi> ls -l debian/config/i386/
[07:50] <peeps> is there some way to list connections to my computer, can I tell if someone is logged in remotely?
[07:50] <nub_> yes. users
[07:50] <Flannel> KrisWood: dpkg -l | grep vmware (or whatever you think it might be)
[07:50] <KnowledgEngi> becouse the directory config do not exist
[07:50] <gop> w
[07:50] <KnowledgEngi> exist the directory Config
[07:50] <KnowledgEngi> low case
[07:50] <nub_> peeps: users
[07:51] <gop> feross,  br
[07:51] <gop> b
[07:51] <Lovloss> How come my two internal HDs arent showing up as mountable disks? they're both NFTS :(
[07:51] <feross> ok
[07:51] <eyequeue> KrisWood, package foo will have a /usr/share/doc/foo directory (as one way)
[07:51] <KnowledgEngi> Processor type and features --> Timer frequency
[07:51] <KrisWood> yeah it's installed, I'll try removing it
[07:51] <peeps> ok, users, but how do I know if that is just some remote computer logged in as my user account or not
[07:51] <Lovloss> They're plugged in for sure too
[07:51] <KnowledgEngi> i need just change value from 250 to 1000 mhz
[07:51] <sn9> peeps: "w"
[07:51] <KnowledgEngi> i changed this and now i'm building the image
[07:51] <peeps> users tells me "peeps peeps peeps"
[07:51] <Parisi> I am going to give a Ubuntu a try again tomorrow, i just dont understand why it doesnt pickup any of my network cards, i must be running some obscure motherboard, it picked up my old hardware perfectly, Ubuntu runs better on aged hardware thats for sure .
[07:52] <KnowledgEngi> i copied the /boot/config..... in /usr/src/linude-version/.config
[07:52] <KnowledgEngi> make oldconfig
[07:52] <KrisWood> ack, it wants to remove my xserver
[07:52] <KrisWood> :-/
[07:52] <nub_> peeps: i think it will show your name for every session you have
[07:52] <KnowledgEngi> make menuconfig
[07:52] <KrisWood> I think this isn't the right package
[07:52] <Lovloss> IDE drives should show up on my desktop right? :< i cant even find them under /media
[07:52] <Lovloss> but the bios saw them
[07:52] <sn9> peeps: use "w"
[07:52] <nub_> so if you have a local and a remote user under the same name, it will say "peeps peeps"
[07:52] <KnowledgEngi> changed the timer frequency
[07:53] <Lovloss> silence ensues
[07:53] <eyequeue> Parisi, some have had some old weird cards that were sensed under the older breezy but not dapper, others have had cards sensed under the newer edgy but no others
[07:53] <nub_> yeah, the "w" command is a lot more detailed than "users"
[07:53] <Lovloss> alright, is there any command to see all unmounted drives?
[07:53] <KrisWood> ok some further googling turned up that I should run the uninstall.pl that came with it
[07:53] <nub_> ls /dev ?
[07:54] <KrisWood> that seems to be working
[07:54] <Lovloss> hmm
[07:54] <LaserLine> Anybody know why my webcam just displays a grey screen... it worked fine in dapper, but I get this grey screen in edgy
[07:54] <Lovloss> er no
[07:54] <nub_> i don't think ntfs support is included by default in ubuntu
[07:54] <Lovloss> it was before i had to reinstall
[07:54] <feross> Lovloss: prolly better to use fdisk..
[07:54] <Parisi> eye, its not even the card itself, its the motheboard, i am using the same wireless card for instance, it just doesnt pickup the motherboard as a whole i suppose.
[07:54] <nub_> are you sure you didn't add it after the original install?
[07:54] <Jaws> it has read for ntfs by deflault
[07:55] <feross> Lovloss: just fdisk /dev/hda  then hdb see what you have
[07:55] <Jaws> but not write i *think*
[07:55] <KrisWood> ok vmware is gone but vmnet8 is still conflicting with my dhcp
[07:55] <peeps> something is taking over my cdrom drive, but I think I just realized what is going on
[07:55] <Lovloss> says neither, but the Bios saw em!!
[07:55] <gop> feross,  k logged via foo, what else do I need, so it works with ubuntu
[07:55] <Lovloss> does it help that they were unplugged when i installed ubuntu?
[07:55] <peeps> I should have never told beagle to index from the root dir
[07:55] <feross> gop: looks good ?
[07:55] <Parisi> eyequeue Its sorta new hardware, i went from a 1.7 Intel to a dual core amd x2 3800XP
[07:55] <gop> like how about system updates
[07:55] <gop> looks way better
[07:56] <Parisi> 3800+ rather*
[07:56] <eyequeue> Parisi, yeah, i love linux for supporting old hardware beyond its life expectancy ... except at times like these
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> Flannel,
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> cp /boot/config-2.6.17-10-generic /usr/src/linux-2.6.18.3/.config
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> make oldconfig && make menuconfig
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> i has modified the timer frequency
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> make prepare && make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install
[07:56] <SilentDis> hello :)
[07:56] <sgl> hello
[07:56] <Lovloss> there they are. hda1 and hdb1
[07:56] <KnowledgEngi> i forget something ?
[07:56] <Lovloss> hda hdb
[07:56] <Parisi> Linux just doesnt get along too well with new hardware, i always had that problem.
[07:56] <Flannel> KnowledgEngi: why not just follow the instructions on that page?
[07:56] <eyequeue> Parisi, ah, i waws thinking yours was old, but new can be the same headache ... excpet that "some day, i hope soon" it can be supported :)
[07:56] <Lovloss> ..... why does fdisk -l find them?
[07:57] <varsendaggr> what is the GUI for mounting disk inside gnome?
[07:57] <sgl> hi, how can i find language-support-zh and install it
[07:57] <feross> gop: you can run apt-get update  then apt-get upgrade  that will update the system but crystal will not be updated automatically. You have to check the website out every once in a while to see when the new version comes out and install.
[07:57] <KnowledgEngi> becouse this page have some error
[07:57] <KnowledgEngi> i try to do it
[07:57] <varsendaggr> usta be disk in preferences
[07:57] <Parisi> eyequeue Ya, someday may be too late thats the sad part, i am on Vista and my next system will probably be a Mac running OSX, its a shame.
[07:57] <KnowledgEngi> and this directory do not exist
[07:57] <eyequeue> Parisi, the best way to guarantee it is to buy one for some kernel developer, heh
[07:57] <KnowledgEngi> the procedure in your page is not complete
[07:57] <KnowledgEngi> Flannel,
[07:57] <gop> Feross will they ever add to the apt list rep list
[07:58] <Lovloss> Okay, fdisk -l lists both hda and hdb, yet "mount dev/hda" an hdb doesnt work
[07:58] <sgl> what to do if i want write in chinese, help
[07:58] <Lovloss> any suggestions?
[07:58] <SilentDis> varsendaggr: if it's just a one-off mount, you can use System > administration > Disks
[07:58] <feross> gop: crystal is just a bunch of themes that are easy to install.. you don't really have to update it very often.
[07:58] <Parisi> I will just keep the old PC for Linux.
[07:58] <eyequeue> Parisi, well, there is a powerpc livecd for ubuntu, if on one short-term :)
[07:58] <gop> cool
[07:58] <gop> how does one change the defualt crystal theme
[07:58] <feross> gop: fvwm get's updated with the rest of the system
[07:58] <Parisi> eyequeue, ya except the newer macs run on a Intel :)
[07:59] <KrisWood> oh wait I've got a different error now
[07:59] <eyequeue> Parisi, or a powerpc install of course, unless it's a newer intel mac
[07:59] <varsendaggr> SilentDis, yeah that is gone i am running edgy
[07:59] <Parisi> : )
[07:59] <feross> gop: the crystal has a bunch of menus... you go to the system recipies and choose one to try out.
[07:59] <SilentDis> varsendaggr:  ahh, sorry.  i haven't made the leap yet.  still running dapper here
[07:59] <Lovloss> Wow. so none of you can help
[07:59] <Lovloss> :P
[07:59] <karat> Is there a ubuntu livecd that isn't a dvd?
[07:59] <eyequeue> Parisi, lol.  something tells me an i386 install disk works on those heh
[08:00] <feross> gop: I meant to say click on the crystal to see what you can edit and modify. the only thing I don't recommend is changing the default file manager to ROX or Nautilus..
[08:00] <malt> Is there anyways i could cap my server ubuntu linux server at 100 KB/s download speed and 20 KB/s upload speed for WAN, but unmetered speeds for LAN?
[08:00] <varsendaggr> Lovloss, what exactly are you typing
[08:00] <sn9> karat: none of the livecd's are on dvd
[08:00] <eyequeue> karat, yes, the download link starting at ubuntu.com should lead to those
[08:00] <KrisWood> ok I got rid of the vmnet8 error, could anyone help me configure dhcp? here's my current syslog error http://pastebin.com/830337
[08:00] <varsendaggr> Lovloss, where do you want the disk mounted?
[08:00] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  you didn't create a logical partition on the disk yet.  /dev/hda is simply a device, you'll need to create /dev/hda1 and such
[08:00] <karat> I was looking in the wrong place I guess :) thanks
[08:00] <gop> feross,  thanks
[08:01] <eyequeue> sn9, my livedvd here somewhat disagrees with you ;-)

[08:01] <Lovloss> i dunno, i just want access to it
[08:01] <feross> gop: ok
[08:01] <foo> How can I force a filesystem check and have fsck check and fix all errors on the next reboot?
[08:01] <Lovloss> so do i just make directories?
[08:01] <sn9> eyequeue: from an official download site?
[08:02] <eyequeue> sn9, http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/dvd/current/
[08:02] <Flannel> KnowledgEngi: I get no error on either page
[08:02] <sn9> heh
[08:02] <Lovloss> lets say i want to mount hda1 and it has no logical drive. How should id o it
[08:02] <J-_> How can i find out an ip of a zombie? or get /rid/ of them for that matter?
[08:02] <Lovloss> "mount hda1 to"...?
[08:02] <sirmis> back
[08:02] <eyequeue> sn9, it's been months since i grabbed it, but the dir is live still, i just checked
[08:02] <karat> Is the livecd the same as the install cd?
[08:03] <KnowledgEngi> ls -l debian/config/i386/
[08:03] <KnowledgEngi> this is the error
[08:03] <feross> Lovloss: did you run a "df -h" to see what you have already
[08:03] <SilentDis> question:  trying to install kubuntu-desktop package on Dapper, get this output:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33248/.  States a dependancy (kdegraphics-kfile-plugins) is not going to be installed, then exits.  any ideas?
[08:03] <KnowledgEngi> in the linux source directory
[08:03] <sn9> karat: the live can install as of 6.06
[08:03] <eyequeue> karat, perhaps :)  there are three cds that install, the live cd the alternate cd and the server cd
[08:03] <Lovloss> all i hazave logically is sda
[08:03] <Lovloss> my external drive
[08:03] <KnowledgEngi> debian/config directory do not exyst
[08:03] <feross> Lovloss: as far as mounted partitions... also you should check your /etc/fstab to see what ubuntu detected..
[08:04] <KnowledgEngi> Flannel, and in the page that you pasted there are not all command
[08:04] <feross> Lovloss: this is on a system that has already been installed or the livecd?
[08:04] <Flannel> KnowledgEngi: and you apt-getted linux-source?
[08:04] <Lovloss> Its installed
[08:04] <feross> ok
[08:04] <KnowledgEngi> if you put all command from the page to the command line
[08:04] <KnowledgEngi> you encounter error
[08:04] <Lovloss> im telling you guys, it sees only my external drive. The two internals, plugged up though they are, are not being read except by fdisk -l
[08:04] <Lovloss> which means it sees them but it has nowhere to mount them right?
[08:05] <karat> Hmm found it, it was labeled a desktop cd for some reason?? oh well :)
[08:05] <J-_> How can i find out an ip of a zombie? or get /rid/ of them for that matter?
[08:05] <KnowledgEngi> sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-devel fakeroot kernel-wedge kernel-package
[08:05] <KnowledgEngi> sudo apt-get install linux-source
[08:05] <KnowledgEngi> i runned this commands
[08:06] <KrisWood> anyone know dhcp configuration?
[08:06] <feross> J-_: you'll have to sniff the network or check the firewall logs. usually zombies make many connections per second.. then walk over to it and hit it with a hammer
[08:06] <rickyfingers> J-_ iptables -I INPUT -s 25.55.55.55 -j DROP
[08:06] <KnowledgEngi> and after i has run: cd linux-source-2.6.17
[08:06] <J-_> thanks
[08:06] <Lovloss> What would happen if i "mkdir /media/hda1/" and "mount /dev/hda1/ to /media/hda1/"  would that work? i have no clue :P
[08:07] <KnowledgEngi> and ls -l debian/config/i386/ tell me that the directory do not exist
[08:07] <Daverocks> Lovloss: without the "to" in the mount command, yes
[08:07] <KnowledgEngi> Flannel,
[08:07] <Lovloss> just a space?
[08:07] <feross> Lovloss: and remember sudo
[08:07] <Lovloss> ok ill try that
[08:07] <Daverocks> Lovloss: yes, and get rid of the slash after "/dev/hda1"
[08:07] <Daverocks> Lovloss: because it's not a folder ;)
[08:08] <Lovloss> worked, but i dont have permision to view. Gksudo?

[08:08] <Lovloss> thanks you all
[08:09] <Marsoph> malt, this is eclypse, my computer is being stupid as hell, what was your msn again?
[08:09] <unfo> hi all, I spend too much time on the Web, irc, and Usenet.  I would like some way to fix this.  One way I have thought of is to somehow ensure that my entire Internet usage history is posted on the web in real-time and shown in my IM nick tagline.  Does this make sense?
[08:09] <Daverocks> unfo: LOL
[08:10] <KrisWood> lol
[08:10] <arsalanyo> Halp Halp
[08:10] <unfo> Daverocks: KrisWood: serious.
[08:10] <malt> Is there anyway i could cap my server ubuntu linux server at 100 KB/s download speed and 20 KB/s upload speed for WAN, but unmetered speeds for LAN?
[08:10] <unfo> you've never had such an issue?
[08:10] <Daverocks> unfo: i admit i've had similar issues, but i haven't thought of putting history in IM tagline o_O
[08:10] <SilentDis> Lovloss:  sorry, stupid ubotu doesn't have the info i was hoping for.  basic command structure for mount is:  mount something /some/where -t type -o options.  for the first partition on the primary hard drive, mounting to /media/harddrive, you'd just need to type "mount /dev/hda1 /media/harddrive" usually :)
[08:10] <KrisWood> between work and kids I don't get to spend enough time online anymore :p
[08:10] <arsalanyo> my ubuntu bootloader is vanished
[08:10] <arsalanyo> what should i do
[08:10] <arsalanyo> plz help
[08:11] <Daverocks> unfo: maybe you could restrict yourself from executing certain programs on certain days
[08:11] <unfo> i have access to sudo though.
[08:11] <arsalanyo> it just goes to windows
[08:11] <sirmis> bbl

[08:12] <unfo> e.g. "what should i do", "plz help", "plz i am in need" :)
[08:12] <eyequeue> unfo, what you're doing is control-through-embarassment?  can't sudo access change the records though?
[08:13] <unfo> eyequeue: what records?
[08:13] <rad|x> hi, i have "sudo timestamp too far in the future: .." how do i fix this?
[08:13] <rad|x> whenever i try to sudo
[08:13] <unfo> I am thinking of control-thru-embarrassment though I don't know if it'd work. (Would it?)
[08:13] <unfo> rad|x: sudo -k
[08:13] <rad|x> same thing
[08:14] <SilentDis> radlx:  i had that shortly after resetting my clock... a simple reboot solved it.
[08:14] <rad|x> nod
[08:14] <unfo> rad|x: sudo -k didn't work?
[08:14] <rad|x> ty =) 'll try
[08:14] <rad|x> it didnt
[08:14] <feross> unfo: how about having someone unplug your internet for a couple of hours? they can hide the cables and you can look all over the house like a desperate puppy :)
[08:14] <rad|x> gave me same error  unfo
[08:14] <rickyfingers> rad|x sudo -K
[08:14] <rad|x> same thing
[08:14] <rad|x> -k or -K
[08:14] <rad|x> same error, this happened after i had udev restart
[08:15] <unfo> feross: hmm, interesting, but nah, i'm 21 and live w/ my parents, there are too many ethernet cables around. :)

[08:16] <rad|x> spasibo slavik, that helps :P
[08:16] <SilentDis> unfo:  may i make an obvious suggestion?  there's a large, blue-ceilinged room behind one of the doors in your domicile.  find it.  explore! :D
[08:16] <eyequeue> unfo, okay, maybe i misinterpret.  if you're posting "something" to the web, your history, where does it pull its info from?  can't you modify that source?
[08:16] <nante> what does FUD mean?
[08:17] <Daverocks> nante: Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt
[08:17] <slavik> rad|x: I was testing my gaim :P    :)
[08:17] <eyequeue> Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
[08:17] <J-_> feross: where are the firewall logs located?
[08:17] <nante> oh, im reading posts and yeah im a newbie, tnx
[08:17] <unfo> eyequeue: if i'm root, i could probably circumvent any embarrassment system unless it ran on my router.
[08:17] <rad|x> ok reboot solved my problem
[08:17] <Adross> what's the command to display the amount of free hard drive space in a terminal?
[08:17] <unfo> if it ran on the router, I'd have to stand up to fix it, and self-control would kick in.
[08:17] <Parisi> Good Night all :)
[08:17] <unfo> or, if I had to reboot to fix it, ditto.
[08:17] <eyequeue> unfo, "your" router short circuits my next suggestion
[08:18] <unfo> eyequeue: what suggestion?
[08:18] <SilentDis> take care all
[08:18] <unfo> well, my parents' router.
[08:18] <feross> J-_: I'm guessing you're looking for a zombie behind a large network.. the network must have a firewall somewhere, depending on the firewall, you may be able to pull connection logs from it.
[08:18] <slavik> Adross: df -H
[08:18] <Adross> ta
[08:18] <unfo> SilentDis: can't now, canada, it's currently dark and cold out.  But I should get out more.  I once made a rule that I would go biking for min. 5 min or more each day before going on the computer.  Too bad I've been slipping in that regard.
[08:19] <rad|x> i have a question, whenever some of my usb devices are created and added to /dev/<dev> their chmod is 666, is it possible to modify this chmod automatically?
[08:19] <eyequeue> unfo, i ssh inro mine, where linux runs :)  but any commercial router may already have some "hours access is allowed to $somewhere from #whichhost" feature?  does yours?
[08:19] <rad|x> like for example set default to 777
[08:19] <unfo> Maybe all I need is an IRC / netnews / web slowdown tool.
[08:19] <sn9> rad|x: yes, using udev rules
[08:19] <J-_> feross: err ok, thanks.. lol
[08:19] <unfo> eyequeue: yes, but i share the router w/ my family.
[08:19] <rad|x> i can't get udev rules to work though
[08:20] <unfo> I wonder if the router can set such rules by IP.
[08:20] <sn9> rad|x: there is a trick to them
[08:20] <Adross> i have a server in the next room which i control by text ssh. How can i remove gnome and all of x etc, and is it safe to do this?
[08:20] <feross> unfo: my self control just kicked in :)) it's called a nakedwife ...
[08:20] <feross> good night
[08:20] <eyequeue> unfo, so only restrict host 192.168.0.$unfo from ports :)
[08:20] <rad|x> for example in rules 70-mydevice.rules
[08:20] <slavik> Adross: it is (as long as ubuntu-minimal and whatnot is not removed)
[08:20] <rad|x> i have BUS="usb" DRIVER="mydriver" MODE="0777"
[08:21] <rad|x> i have BUS="usb", DRIVER="mydriver", MODE="0777"
[08:21] <Adross> slavik: ta, now how do i remove it?
[08:21] <rad|x> and it still doesnt work
[08:21] <eyequeue> unfo, os put the rest on 192.168.0 and give yourself 192.168.1 heh
[08:21] <slavik> Adross: you can do apt-get stuff on the remove system as if you are behind it (one of the purposes of SSH)
[08:21] <eyequeue> oR not os
[08:21] <Adross> apt-get doesn't remove dependencies though
[08:21] <sn9> rad|x: ok, that's what you have for =, but what do you have for ==?
[08:21] <rad|x> ==?
[08:22] <sn9> KERNEL=="foo"
[08:22] <rad|x> do i need KERNEL?
[08:22] <slavik> == equal comparison operator (= is assignment)
[08:23] <wthww> hello all
[08:23] <sn9> not necessarily KERNEL, but something with ==
[08:23] <wthww> :)
[08:23] <rad|x> well i dont understand why though
[08:23] <rad|x> i have a bunch of examples which dont involve ==
[08:24] <Adross> does anyone know of a text based bit torrent client?
[08:24] <sn9> rad|x: how else is it gonna know what to apply the rule to? where do you see an example without ==?
[08:24] <rad|x> nod
[08:25] <sn9> Adross: why not the original? it's called bittorrent
[08:25] <Adross> what a fitting name
[08:25] <Adross> thanks guys, later
[08:26] <rad|x> sn9 thanks a bunch

[08:34] <unfo> kayxray: an example: sudo dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/home/unfo/windows_backup.img bs=1M
[08:34] <unfo> and you're done.
[08:35] <unfo> compressed images are easy too.
[08:35] <dsdg> halo #ubuntu, i am trying to install ubuntu 6.10 edgy on a Compaq Armada M700 i pop in  the cd and it boots, but when i install it seems the cd has gone into an endless loop, the cdrom might be slow but if it boots it should install right? whats my options here?
[08:36] <vit_>     ?    -       \
[08:36] <kayxray> Compressing is just gzip/bzip the resulting file?
[08:36] <kayxray> dd will make a file the same full size though, right?  Like, 10GB hda1 = 10GB file (before compression)?
[08:36] <unfo> vit_: english? francais? espanol? chinese? korean? japanese?
[08:36] <Lovloss> is therer any way in gksudo to make a folder and ALL folders inside recursively change permissions so i can get to them without being root?
[08:37] <kayxray> !easysource
[08:37] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[08:37] <arsalanyo> i cant find the iso image of super grub its nowhere
[08:37] <Lovloss> it doesnt have a recursion option

[08:37] <kayxray> it's listed on the URL I mentioned previously
[08:38] <vit_> ok
[08:38] <unfo> kayxray: you can gzip as you dd. You get a 25% or 50% smaller file.
[08:38] <unfo> vit_, :-)
[08:38] <Lovloss> anyone? :<
[08:38] <arsalanyo> the page was not getting opened thanks its downlaoding now
[08:38] <vit_> ubuntu-ru :That channel doesn't exist
[08:38] <kayxray> ok, glad you got it going.
[08:39] <kayxray> unfo
[08:39] <kayxray> unfo: how do you do that?  dd 'stuff' | gzip file ?
[08:39] <iter> Lovloss: open terminal and do chmod -R user folder/
[08:39] <nub_> hello again
[08:39] <unfo> vit_: /join #ubuntu-ru
[08:39] <nub_> can anybody tell me how to kill the x server so i can install the nvidia closed drivers?
[08:39] <unfo> vit_: you need the #

[08:40] <zcat[1] > nub_: ctrl-alt-F1, log in, type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
[08:40] <nub_> thank you
[08:40] <Lovloss> I dont get this chmod command
[08:40] <kayxray> unfo, awesome! thanks
[08:40] <unfo> Lovloss: google for: chmod tutorial
[08:40] <iter> Lovloss: oh crud, sorry, should be chown
[08:40] <unfo> kayxray: you're welcome.
[08:40] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: right-click on the files, choose properties..
[08:41] <Lovloss> i can make *one* folder available, but folders inside the folder wont go with it
[08:41] <unfo> zcat[1] ++
[08:41] <zcat[1] > ahhh... ok
[08:41] <Lovloss> and its got tons of folders
[08:41] <Lovloss> would chown really help?
[08:42] <iter> Lovloss: sudo chown -R user /path/to/folder
[08:42] <Lovloss> user being my username?
[08:42] <iter> right... now what are you doing that to
[08:42] <iter> nothing important right?
[08:42] <zcat[1] > iter: chown or chmod? does he want it accessable to everyone else, or owned by another user?
[08:42] <kayxray> unfo:  about your 'dd if=/dev/hda1 bs=1M | gzip - > file.img.gz' command.  how do I restore :) ?  'dd if=file.img.gz bs=1M of=/dev/hda1 | gzip'?  Can you recommend a good place to learn about the | stuff?
[08:42] <Lovloss> a folder i copied from another HD
[08:43] <iter> Lovloss: and it's owned by root or something?
[08:43] <zcat[1] > Sorry, OK.. iter is on the right track then :)
[08:43] <Lovloss> yeah, after all its not on my linux partition
[08:43] <iter> Lovloss: you just want to be able to browse through it right
[08:43] <Lovloss> it was originally running in XP
[08:43] <Lovloss> no. i want to be able to treat it as i please
[08:43] <Lovloss> add/erase aand such. make it usable
[08:43] <iter> Lovloss: yeah you can use chown -R
[08:43] <Lovloss> okay ill give it a shot
[08:44] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: so you copied it into home as root?
[08:44] <Lovloss> if its on my desktop that'd be /home/desktop?
[08:44] <unfo> kayxray: I strongly recommend you get help in person. May I ask where you live? Otherwise, look into good Unix books. Or see the website An Introduction to Command-Line Linux
[08:44] <iter> Desktop
[08:44] <Lovloss> i copied it onto my desktop using gksudo
[08:44] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: /home/yourname/Desktop
[08:44] <erpo> Hi all. Nautilus is using 99.5% CPU and I have no idea why. I'd like to report this as a bug, but I don't know how. Normally, when a program crashes, I submit a backtrace. What should I do when a program just won't let go of the CPU but otherwise continues to work?
[08:44] <Lovloss> aha ok
[08:44] <kayxray> Tampa, FL.
[08:44] <unfo> kayxray: google for: tampa linux user group
[08:45] <unfo> kayxray: or check www.meetup.com, or find a local university computer club or Linux club.
[08:45] <unfo> Or take classes.
[08:45] <iter> or just read wikipedia
[08:45] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: alt-F2 then gksudo chown -R you /home/you/Desktop/folder
[08:46] <zcat[1] > (where 'you' is the user you're logged in s)
[08:46] <kayxray> Awesome, thanks again!

[08:51] <afd_> hi! If I have a RAID array (2 drives) and the bios software didn't recognize one of the drives as part of the array, asked me if I wanted to include it, not wants to rebuild the array, do I lose the data as a result of rebuilding the array?
[08:51] <zircx> dang

[08:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[08:51] <sn9> zcat[1] : "kl" is not the language code for klingon
[08:52] <siXy> afd_, dont use cheap onboard raid controllers with linux.
[08:52] <zircx> zcat[1] , sector 4 warp 3
[08:52] <iter> afd_: very likely
[08:52] <Guest007> that is just amazing.
[08:52] <iter> afd_: can you still see the array in windows?
[08:52] <nathansnook7> defrysk: what am I looking for
[08:52] <zcat[1] > sn9: hmm.. you know what is?
[08:52] <defrysk> nathansnook7, open top in your console and see what process is consuming
[08:52] <siXy> just set them as normal drives and use software raid.
[08:52] <floating> Hi. I am trying to install fonts, but: Setting up xfonts-intl-chinese (1.2.1-6ubuntu1) ...
[08:52] <afd_> siXy, iter: I'm using a PCI expansion board, I don't have windows on that computer and I haven't had the guts to fully reboot the OS
[08:52] <floating> warning: /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc does not exist or is not a directory
[08:53] <sn9> not offhand, but i think it's three letters, and one of them is "t"
[08:53] <siXy> afd_, which board?
[08:53] <iter> afd_: is there data on the drives you can't lose
[08:53] <afd_> siXy: iter: I just stopped it at the Boot screen
[08:53] <zcat[1] > brb; googling
[08:53] <afd_> iter: yes, I'd rather not lose the data
[08:53] <nathansnook7> defrysk: looks like it is called events/0
[08:53] <afd_> I can take one of the drives out and back it up, but I don't want to waste time
[08:54] <siXy> what pci board is it?
[08:54] <sn9> !ka
[08:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ka - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:54] <iter> afd_: so you had this array setup in ubuntu previously right
[08:54] <afd_> iter: yes
[08:54] <zcat[1] > !tlh
[08:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tlh - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:54] <iter> using mdadm or what
[08:54] <afd_> siXy: I don't remember, but I'm trying to find out
[08:55] <zcat[1] > !botsnack
[08:55] <ubotu> Yum!
[08:55] <zcat[1] > Someone needs to craft a reply in klingon for !tlh
[08:55] <iter> afd_: did you set the array up with mdadm or via bios
[08:55] <afd_> iter: I haven't had it setup as anything in Ubuntu
[08:55] <afd_> I set it up in bios
[08:55] <iter> afd_: so how is there data on it?
[08:56] <afd_> iter: in ubuntu it appears as a single drive
[08:56] <afd_> sdd or something
[08:56] <iter> afd_: ok so previously, you set it up in the bios, then installed to /dev/sdd
[08:56] <sn9> !botsnack apt-get
[08:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about botsnack apt-get - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:57] <iter> afd_: which is an array that appears to ubuntu as one drive
[08:57] <iter> afd_: right?
[08:57] <afd_> iter: exactly
[08:57] <TaeBo-> Does anyone know how to boot a linux partition without grub set up?
[08:57] <iter> afd_: then, what happened ?
[08:57] <unfo> TaeBo-: use a grub cd-rom
[08:57] <TaeBo-> That simple?
[08:57] <unfo> no
[08:57] <afd_> I'm doing RAID 1 (mirroring)
[08:57] <unfo> you have to know how to use the grub cd.  Look for a grub tutorial.
[08:58] <iter> afd_: right so you rebooted and now your bios is complaining that a drive is not part of the array?
[08:58] <TaeBo-> unfo: There is nothing already set up that I can download? I have to custom make a CD?
[08:58] <iter> afd_: if that's the case go ahead and tell the bios to rebuild the array
[08:58] <unfo> TaeBo-: grab a grub cd off google.
[08:58] <zcat[1] > TaeBo-: boot a live CD, mount your target, then use grub-install with the appropriate switches to make it install grub on the drive.
[08:58] <afd_> iter: right. It asked me that drive 0 is not part of the array, and if I want to include it. I said yes, and then it said it wants to rebuild the array
[08:59] <afd_> iter: what's gonna happen?
[08:59] <iter> afd_: yep, rebuild it
[08:59] <unfo> TaeBo-: do what zcat[1]  said.  It's more practical.
[08:59] <TaeBo-> zcat: then can I load that with ntdlr?
[08:59] <iter> afd_: it's going to sync disk 0 with disk 1
[08:59] <TaeBo-> Unfo:Thanks
[08:59] <afd_> ok
[08:59] <iter> afd_: might take awhile, depending on size
[08:59] <unfo> TaeBo-: you're welcome
[08:59] <siXy> afd_, what i am attempting to discover is if you are using true hardware raid (fairly unlikely) or if you have a software raid setup.
[08:59] <zcat[1] > TaeBo-: Umm, if you install to the partition rather than the mbr I think you can
[08:59] <unfo> TaeBo-: please tell us what the original problem is :)
[09:00] <afd_> siXy: I have a PCI extension card, I haven't set up anything in software
[09:00] <afd_> the BIOS software might to anything, but I don't know
[09:00] <afd_> I can take out the card from the slot, to take a look at the chipset
[09:00] <Viper> would someone please help with installing beryl
[09:00] <zcat[1] > TaeBo-: and reason you don't want to boot Windows with grub?
[09:00] <TaeBo-> unfo: I had linux loaded and couldn't get windows to boot, so I fixed the MBR to work with windows again, now I have no clue how to dual boot, and my linux is currently unbootable, so I pretty much just swapped OSs
[09:00] <zcat[1] > !beryl
[09:00] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:01] <siXy> if ubuntu saw it as a single drive then it is a true hardware card. in which case you should rebuild it (probably)
[09:01] <zircx> damn there use to be a dbz irc server i use to connect to, to download the series..
[09:01] <siXy> however if it is a hardware raid card the drive fell out of the array for a reason, so i would test the drive first.
[09:01] <afd_> siXy: 7t8712 or something like that
[09:01] <zcat[1] > TaeBo-: my experience, getting grub to boot windows is easier than getting ntldr to boot linux
[09:02] <unfo> !no, Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment.  It provides fancier effects than compiz, such as windows burning down.  See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:02] <TaeBo-> zcat: I had some issue with ntldr and LBA in my bios settings I think, and I couldn't get windows to load through grub at all
[09:02] <zircx> TaeBo-, shit if I had a memory i'd be able to help you lol
[09:02] <TaeBo-> Heh
[09:02] <TaeBo-> Np
[09:02] <fiendskull9> hey guys
[09:02] <fiendskull9> i just came across this
[09:03] <fiendskull9> and wanted to know if this is legal

[09:03] <zircx> i believe you can write an bootable image from linux that can be used in windows that will help you
[09:03] <floating> Heyy. I try install extra fonts, and at the end of apt-get message it says that /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc does not exist or is not a directory. Did it install the fonts or not ?
[09:03] <siXy> afd_, on its own that doesnt mean much to me ;) is it and ide, scsi or sas card?
[09:03] <unfo> fiendskull9: it is legal to sell open source software.
[09:03] <fiendskull9> ok
[09:03] <fiendskull9> JW
[09:03] <Lovloss> i have to ask a question, and its very, very ridiculous, but i think i need to know the answer.... bare with me here
[09:03] <afd_> siXy: IDE
[09:04] <zcat[1] > !ask
[09:04] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:04] <TaeBo-> Whoa
[09:04] <Lovloss> My girlfriend switched to ubuntu FINALLY and im happy, but she's sad because she really wants to run "virtuaguy" like she did with windows. Its this dude who dances on your desktop. Whatever. Anyway, sh's threatening to go back to windows, and that i cannot have, so...
[09:04] <TaeBo-> I was just thinking that
[09:04] <Lovloss> :P
[09:04] <zcat[1] > Lovloss: perhaps it will run in wine?
[09:04] <zircx> ah here it is..
[09:04] <zircx> or something close to TaeBo-
[09:04] <Lovloss> its using wine, but the image flickers
[09:04] <zircx> http://jaeger.morpheus.net/linux/ntldr.php
[09:04] <Lovloss> a lot
[09:04] <iter> haha virtuaguy: desktop stripper app
[09:04] <unfo> !no, Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment.  Compared to compiz, it provides added effects, such as windows burning down.  See http://forum.beryl-project.org/.  For help, see #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl.
[09:04] <TaeBo-> zircx: Thanks
[09:05] <Lovloss> yeah lol
[09:05] <zircx> np, it's a pretty simple process
[09:05] <TaeBo-> I read that one, it expects you to have access to your linux and use lilo
[09:05] <zircx> it just means your using ntldr to boot instead of grub or in my case , i was using lilo
[09:05] <siXy> afd_, thre are not very many true hardware ide raid controllers out there anymore
[09:05] <unfo> Lovloss: try AMOR or its competitors.
[09:05] <unfo> !amor
[09:05] <zircx> erm
[09:05] <ubotu> amor: a KDE creature for your desktop. In component main, is optional. Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 329 kB, installed size 2092 kB
[09:05] <Lovloss> okay thanks. :)
[09:06] <zircx> oh shit, forgot, ubuntu not slackware lol
[09:06] <zcat[1] > does amor have adult animations for it?
[09:06] <zircx> TaeBo-, you should be able to boot into your linux with a boot cd surely..
[09:06] <unfo> zcat[1] : i doubt it.  Those things can scar young children for life.
[09:07] <TaeBo-> Ok
[09:07] <TaeBo-> I do have a live cd
[09:07] <zcat[1] > too late, my kids found 'grannyparts' all by themselves.. nothing shocks them any more...

[09:07] <floating> Hi, I tried apt-get install extra fonts, and at the end of apt-get message it says that /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc does not exist or is not a directory. Did it install the fonts or not ?
[09:07] <Viper> hi
[09:08] <zcat[1] > kinda like lemonparty, but a whole website of it!!
[09:08] <floating> Hard to google anything for this
[09:08] <Lovloss> she's making a thing out of this. where is this 'Amor'?
[09:08] <TaeBo-> lemonparty haunts me
[09:08] <unfo> Lovloss: sudo apt-get install amor
[09:08] <Viper> i just updated my nvidia driver to the latest one from the one that came default with the ubuntu install and now i'm stuck in the 800x600 resolution
[09:08] <Lovloss> that works for me lol
[09:08] <Viper> what should i do to change it to 1024x968
[09:08] <Kvek> hello

[09:10] <unfo> Kvek: there are always five hundred people here who can help.
[09:10] <unfo> Kvek: insert the ubuntu 6.06 cd then reboot
[09:10] <unfo> then click the "install" button on your desktop.
[09:10] <zcat[1] > usually it's just like installing a desktop, but less hardware works out of the box :)
[09:10] <sn9> unfo: 500? out of 871?
[09:10] <Kvek> well i'm booting from cd not HD
[09:11] <Lovloss> where is this amor? i installed it
[09:11] <unfo> sn9: i was estimating :)
[09:11] <unfo> Lovloss: Alt+F2, amor
[09:11] <unfo> then press Enter
[09:11] <me> are there hotkeys for switching around in the workspace manager?
[09:11] <me> i don't see anything under preferences
[09:11] <unfo> Lovloss: if amor does not show up in the menu, that is probably a bug that should be reported to the Ubuntu team.

[09:13] <Adross> When I uninstall things, the .debs remain on the system. Where are they and how can i delete them?
[09:13] <sn9> 871 people here and nobody has any idea why firefox would SIGILL?
[09:13] <unfo> sn9: see irc.mozilla.org #firefox
[09:13] <me> what are the hotkeys for switching tabs in firefox?
[09:13] <Lovloss> hey. amor is just dancing penguins
[09:14] <unfo> Lovloss: right click -> change character
[09:14] <Lovloss> i think she wants the male strippers :P
[09:14] <iter> Adross: /var/cache/apt/archives
[09:14] <unfo> me: ctrl+pageup ctrl+pagedown
[09:14] <sn9> unfo: i'm positive they'd send me back here for an ubuntu-specific problem
[09:14] <Adross> iter: can i just safely rm -rf that folder?
[09:15] <sn9> Adross: no
[09:15] <iter> Adross: leave the folder
[09:15] <iter> Adross: you can rm the contents
[09:15] <unfo> sn9: oh. then try: sudo apt-get install mozilla-browser
[09:15] <Adross> how can i empty it then?
[09:15] <unfo> maybe?
[09:15] <sn9> Adross: sudo apt-get clean
[09:15] <Adross> what's the command?
[09:15] <J-_> Whenever I open Opera, top says I have a zombie, is that normal?
[09:15] <iter> Adross: yep apt-get clean
[09:16] <frantic> does anyone know when wine 0.9.25 is gunna be in the ubuntu repositories?
[09:16] <iter> me: I like ctrl-tab and ctrl-shift-tab for firefox tabs
[09:16] <Adross> when i try to install ubuntu-desktop, after that command, it shows that they are still held locally
[09:16] <sn9> J-_: i don't think so, but i'll open opera to check
[09:16] <J-_> sn9: thanks
[09:16] <Kvek> what am i looking for on the forums page?
[09:16] <unfo> frantic: nobody here is likely to know.  You can always build it yourself.  But why do you want 0.9.25?
[09:16] <unfo> Kvek: "Post a New Question"
[09:17] <sn9> frantic: use the budgetdedicated repository
[09:17] <Kvek> well i'm trying to install Ubuntu now
[09:17] <frantic> WoW is supposed to work, no fuss
[09:17] <frantic> could never get it to work before
[09:17] <frantic> And although I quit, I think that's awesome
[09:17] <unfo> frantic: are you sure it'll work no fuss? did they fix the memory management patch-and-recompile issue?
[09:18] <unfo> frantic: also, don't go back :)
[09:18] <frantic> and i happen to have time left on my account :///
[09:18] <unfo> Kvek: then install it :)
[09:18] <frantic> I don't know, I just read that 0.9.25 fixed whatever pissed WoW off
[09:18] <Kvek> what would cause the install process to freeze?
[09:19] <unfo> Kvek: dunno. Try the alternate install CD.
[09:19] <sn9> J-_: zombie here
[09:19] <Kvek> i only got 1 cd
[09:19] <J-_> sn9: weird, thanks for checking
[09:19] <unfo> Kvek: you can download the alternate cd online.
[09:19] <unfo> also, consider Ubuntu 6.06 or 6.10 or 5.10
[09:19] <Kvek> i have Ubuntu 6.06
[09:20] <unfo> Kvek: try 6.10 alternate cd, or else use 6.10.
[09:20] <Kvek> ok thanks
[09:20] <unfo> Kvek: or ask your question again, but be specific.

[09:21] <watson540> Im into dependancy hell whilst trying to install kde!!
[09:22] <frantic> don't you just install kde-desktop or something
[09:22] <watson540> i did a 'apt-get install kubuntu-desktop' and now it wont let me get past these damn broken pythion packages
[09:22] <eyequeue> Kvek, i know nothing about that, sorry, my only guess might be to experiment with bios options (after writing down the original)
[09:22] <watson540> so i cant finish my install of kde!!
[09:22] <Kvek> where do i find the bios options?
[09:22] <watson540> i've tried everything i can ..running apt-get -f install, removing the package ..etc
[09:22] <watson540> can anyone help??
[09:22] <frantic> oh a bunch of python packages?
[09:22] <frantic> like python 2.4 packages?
[09:23] <unfo> Kvek: either: 1) try rebooting and try installing again, or 2) try the 6.10 install cd, or 3) ask on www.ubuntuforums.org if nobody here answers your question after 1 hour :)
[09:23] <watson540> frantic, yes, specifically its stopping on pythonsip2.4
[09:23] <eyequeue> Kvek, when you boot your machine, depending on which mfr, etc, you press f2 or esc or some key, you'll see it on the splash at boot usually
[09:23] <watson540> should i rebot? doubt it would help
[09:23] <frantic> heh, my apt is locked at the moment
[09:23] <dankmiser> good morning everyon
[09:23] <watson540> this sucklls...
[09:23] <dankmiser> anyone know why xmms would just keep buffering over and over again for aac?
[09:23] <frantic> but umm when i updated to edgy, i had a bunch of python packages that would not update
[09:23] <frantic> i had to do them manually
[09:24] <unfo> Kvek: try setting "ACPI Aware O/S" or "Enable Power Mgmt" other similar settings to "Off" or "On"
[09:24] <watson540> friggin gnome started hard locking ion me every time i started it  so i figured what the hay man, i never liked gnome anyway, 'apt-get remove gnome' and 'apt-get install kubuntu-desktop' but cmon wtyth man
[09:24] <unfo> good luck all.
[09:24] <watson540> i thought crap like this was a thing of the past as in 1993
[09:24] <frantic> haha
[09:24] <frantic> apt-get remove gnome <--- why oh god
[09:24] <watson540> friggin cant upgrade, and cant fix the brpookken packages
[09:25] <watson540> unless i remove all of kubuntu desktop and start over, but hey then itll just freeze at the same point all over again
[09:25] <frantic> i think you should just download a kubuntu cd and install that
[09:26] <watson540> might as friggin well, and wouldnt be a problem, umm except for that i dont have any blank cd's! heh
[09:26] <frantic> but man, don't uninstall gnome before you get kde operating!
[09:26] <watson540> any way to do a network install?
[09:26] <watson540> bah gnome was just hard locking my computrer anyway, what good does that do me?
[09:26] <watson540> heh
[09:27] <frantic> i doubt gnome was doing that
[09:27] <dankmiser> btw, beryl is AWESOME, just got it up and goin
[09:27] <watson540> i swear it was
[09:27] <watson540> i would start X with just an xterm and it was fine.,... if i kickstarted gnome-session through that xterm ...hard lock
[09:27] <zcat[1] > dankmiser: Yeah, that lasts about half an hour. Then you go into config and switch off about 75% of the effects before it drives you insane .. :)
[09:27] <watson540> all started when i was working on getting my tv out going on my ati card
[09:28] <watson540> which right now kde has me in a friggin virtual resolution on both screeens yay
[09:28] <frantic> xgl, compiz, aiglx or anything?
[09:28] <watson540> but i used a stock xorg.,conf and everything..gnome just died
[09:28] <frantic> weird
[09:28] <iter> zcat[1] : I still use beryl every day
[09:28] <sn9> watson540: what a coincidence -- that's what eventually led me to a non-working firefox
[09:28] <watson540> nah i removed all that junk
[09:29] <zcat[1] > iter: with the default settings?
[09:29] <iter> zcat[1] : some effects suck but you just turn em off
[09:29] <watson540> man  this install is only 2 days old tooo wth man
[09:29] <lucychili> hi folks
[09:29] <iter> zcat[1] : well no of course
[09:29] <zcat[1] > It's nice, but the default is just showing off all the effects..
[09:30] <lakbu> has anyone know how to setup a linux streaming media server that streams video wmv, avi, mpg ?
[09:30] <nub_> ok, now i need a little help with wine :/
[09:30] <lucychili> wondering if there is an a4 flyer i can use to give to politicians as a quick introduction to ubuntu
[09:30] <lucychili> i can print them out if there is a pdf
[09:30] <Vich> eeeek
[09:31] <nub_> i try to run winecfg, and it gives me this error:
[09:31] <nub_> exec: 29: /usr/local/bin/wine: not found
[09:31] <Vich> I killed ubuntu :s
[09:31] <dankmiser> zcat[1]  yea I toned it way down from the start
[09:31] <watson540> man this apt database is trashed is there no way around it?
[09:31] <nub_> it's there in the directory listing, but something is telling it that it's not there
[09:31] <Vich> I installed a wireless card driver that I learned had problems AFTER I installed it
[09:31] <Vich> rebooting in safe mode to remove it ;/
[09:31] <sn9> nub_: where did you get wine?
[09:31] <battousaix19> hello
[09:31] <watson540> ima just try to build these3 brokens from source i guess oh friggin boy
[09:32] <nub_> the ubuntu forums. i'm using the amd64 version of ubuntu
[09:32] <battousaix19> i love ubuntu, but i feel sorta bad
[09:32] <nub_> there is no package for wine yet
=== monokrom1 is now known as monokrome
[09:32] <zcat[1] > beryl is cool though. Still trying to get it to play nice with fullscreen games and video, but at least I got it running dual-head between the screen and TVout now.. big step.
[09:32] <nub_> sn9: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297280
[09:32] <sn9> nub_: wine will not work on amd64. wipe it and install i386
[09:32] <battousaix19> and ive made a chioce to learn how to program in order to give back to the community and open source somehow:)
[09:33] <malv-laptop> how is the support for the intel 965 boards under Ubuntu?
[09:33] <Vich> lol, how nice of you battousaix19
[09:33] <battousaix19> lol, really, im set on learning how to program based to help the community
[09:33] <me> what's the website on how to properly install nvidia-glx drivers?
[09:33] <nub_> funny, all these people in this thread are saying it works fine.
[09:33] <battousaix19> and im a user of ubuntu, somtimes kubuntu tho;)
[09:33] <zcat[1] > !nv
[09:33] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:33] <juancarlos> me: google for it.
[09:34] <Vich> no such luck on recovery mode
[09:34] <Vich> still freezes at startup :s
[09:34] <Vich> I'm officially screwed
[09:34] <zcat[1] > I just apt-get install nvidia-glx and then adjust the xorg.conf by hand..
[09:34] <battousaix19> does any coding language mateter for debugging other then c and c++??
[09:34] <zcat[1] > but that's probably not what the wiki says to do
[09:34] <Vich> mateter?
[09:35] <battousaix19> oops, srry *matter
[09:35] <Vich> that sentence still makes little sense if you meant matter
=== tang^2 is now known as tang^
[09:35] <Vich> do you mean does every coding language offer debugging?
[09:35] <battousaix19> does any other language really matter for debugging??
[09:35] <sn9> nub_: they don't seem to be saying that the way i read
[09:35] <Vich> o_O
=== juancarlos is now known as juangt
[09:36] <Vich> how can a language matter for debugging?
[09:36] <zcat[1] > depends what you want to work on.. not much point learning C if you weant to hack something that was written in python or java..
[09:36] <Vich> lol
[09:36] <Vich> I still have no idea exactly what he means
[09:36] <battousaix19> since i want to contribute by debugging, and im wondering if c ad c++ are the only 1's worth my time to learn
[09:36] <Vich> OH
[09:36] <zcat[1] > debugging what?
[09:36] <Vich> you want to learn a program to assist with debugging
[09:36] <battousaix19> cablah:P, lol
[09:36] <Vich> (a programming language)
[09:36] <battousaix19> yes:)
[09:36] <Vich> lolol
[09:37] <juangt> battousaix19: debugging is the process of finding bugs on a program, regardless of the language
[09:37] <Vich> indeed
[09:37] <Vich> BUT
[09:37] <Vich> I think he's asking what the main languages are
[09:37] <gangien> learn cobol
[09:37] <bhudda> can someone link me to installing wine under Edgy 64?
[09:37] <battousaix19> basically
[09:37] <juangt> battousaix19: googlefight.com and see which is the most popular
[09:37] <Vich> I'd say c++ and python
[09:37] <Vich> lol
[09:37] <juangt> that way you can help the most people :-)
[09:37] <battousaix19> cuz i dont think bein a master of ryuby will help me debug c code;)
[09:38] <Vich> it should help
[09:38] <Vich> ruby is similar syntax
[09:38] <battousaix19> pythin is used THAT much in linux??
[09:38] <Vich> it's all good experience
[09:38] <Vich> I know heaps of languages
[09:38] <Vich> yeah it's used a lot
[09:38] <Vich> for apps, widgets, etc
[09:38] <zcat[1] > I just try to write good bug reports... I can't code worth a damn.
[09:38] <Vich> easy to code as well
[09:38] <Vich> lol;
[09:39] <battousaix19> coul du give me a ballpark guess in % in your experience, the language sum of all of linux;)
[09:39] <gangien> oi
[09:39] <juangt> lol
[09:39] <battousaix19> like 50% c, 20% pything, etc?
[09:39] <gangien> i'd say 50% sphaghetti code
[09:39] <sn9> battousaix19: for debugging, nothing beats assembly language
[09:39] <zcat[1] > 2% curse words
[09:39] <juangt> buttousaix19: once you become good with a language, you'll be good with any of them so don't worry about choosing one
[09:40] <TheMoebius> I'm trying to run an application that I compiled that needs the libOgreMain, which I compiled from source and installed using checkinstall. But when I try to run my application it says that it can't find libOgreMain.so.12. I checked and it does exist in /usr/local/lib. how do I get my app to see the lib?
[09:41] <KnowledgEngi> ufff
[09:41] <KnowledgEngi> kernel panic
[09:41] <nub_> nice
[09:41] <battousaix19> ok well w/e;), i guess ill learn c based on id like to understand the bulk of linux code so i can see mistakes
[09:41] <sn9> TheMoebius: your first mistake was acknowledging that checkinstall even exists
[09:41] <gangien> battousaix19: do you know other languages? if not c is probably not the best language to start out with
[09:42] <KnowledgEngi> i has download kernel source from www.kernel.org
[09:42] <KnowledgEngi> unpacked it
[09:42] <juangt> battousaix19: C is good.
[09:42] <gimmulf_> Is there any great mediaplayer except xmms/rhythmbox/mplayer
[09:42] <nub_> videolan
[09:42] <KnowledgEngi> cp /boot/config---- /usr/src/linux-2.6.18.3/.config
[09:42] <Celldweller> yup
[09:42] <juangt> gimmulf: vlc & totem
[09:42] <KnowledgEngi> make oldconfig
[09:42] <TheMoebius> ya, i think C is good for starting out with, makes you learn about real programming before you go on to the fake stuff like c++ and java
[09:43] <Celldweller> vlc plays almost everything
[09:43] <KnowledgEngi> make menuconfig
[09:43] <battousaix19> lol, not really must exp at all, i learned sum pascal in school, and have searched for languages based on their stengths and weaknesses compared to others
[09:43] <KnowledgEngi> add some support
[09:43] <KnowledgEngi> make prepare
[09:43] <gangien> low level != real programming
[09:43] <nub_> if you know pascal, you almost know c
[09:43] <juangt> battousaix19: pascal sucks :-)
[09:43] <KnowledgEngi> make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install && make install
[09:43] <zcat[1] > learn python. It's nice
[09:44] <KnowledgEngi> and after i has changed menu.lst
[09:44] <zcat[1] > KnowledgEngi: you probably need to build an initrd
[09:44] <KnowledgEngi> but when i reboot i have kernel panic
[09:44] <battousaix19> becuz, for sum reason, i just have a liking for ada... i have been comparing it to others and it just seems so adaptable and productive
[09:44] <battousaix19> i know, i hate pascal, lol
[09:44] <KnowledgEngi> probabily yes zcat[1] 
[09:44] <battousaix19> but i learnt it for grades;), so i had to, lol
[09:44] <KnowledgEngi> how can i build the initrd
[09:44] <KnowledgEngi> ???
[09:44] <zcat[1] > mkinitrd ?
[09:45] <TheMoebius> KnowledgEngi: yeah when you recompile your kernel there are many things that can go wrong. why did you have to recompile?
[09:45] <battousaix19> and seeing that ada is the chioce for the department of defnce and almost all avionics systems out there, i REALLY respect that
[09:45] <KnowledgEngi> becouse i need Time frequency = 1000
[09:45] <KnowledgEngi> 1000 mHz
[09:46] <KnowledgEngi>  becouse 250 mHz is not good for rosegarden
[09:46] <zcat[1] > I suspect there's something in /proc you can write to change that :)
[09:46] <juangt> i go to gatech, and i see avionic systems made in java, c, matlab, and suck lol
[09:46] <juangt> such*lol
[09:46] <sn9> battousaix19: if that's why you like ada, you'll love forth
[09:46] <gangien> writing to /proc?
[09:46] <gangien> i didn't think you could write to /proc
[09:46] <battousaix19> forth eh??

[10:01] <bruce_> Ne???
[10:01] <bruce_> Me???
[10:01] <zcat[1] > wiz: don't think so
[10:01] <darko3d> thats, that worked
[10:02] <wiz> zcat[1] , damn
[10:02] <wiz> zcat[1] , I didn't think so, but you never know eh?
[10:02] <defrysk> wiz, with the latest nvidia-drivers you can
[10:02] <zcat[1] > Well there you go :)
[10:02] <Guest007> !this_bot_is_the_bomb
[10:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about this_bot_is_the_bomb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[10:03] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[10:03] <wiz> defrysk, what version?
[10:03] <darko3d> ok, i moved a file to that directory, but when i left click on it, the rename function is disabled, how can i rename that file?
[10:03] <Guest007> sorry zcat[1]  :-)
[10:03] <defrysk> amaranth has a beta version available in his repo doing just that
[10:03] <Amaranth> doing what?
[10:04] <Amaranth> and they aren't beta :P
[10:04] <noiesmo> darko3d, sudo chmod -r 755 /directory
[10:04] <zcat[1] > Amaranth's repo is only for edgy?
[10:04] <defrysk> Amaranth, no beta , but the last stable now :) ?
[10:04] <Amaranth> defrysk: yeah, it's the 9629 stable release
[10:05] <Amaranth> and it's edgy onlu
[10:05] <Amaranth> err, only
[10:05] <Amaranth> afaik the 9xxx drivers don't work correctly with xorg 7.0
[10:05] <defrysk> wiz, edgy only add "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com edgy lrm" to your sources.list
[10:05] <ajmitch> thankfully the 9629 drivers are in feisty now
[10:05] <wiz> defrysk, is it like new nvidia-settings in conjunction with the newest driver? I'm not finding anything in the readme about how?
[10:05] <Amaranth> ajmitch: they are?
[10:06] <Amaranth> ajmitch: that'd be the 2.6.19-6 l-r-m then?
[10:06] <wiz> defrysk, so I have to dist upgrade?
[10:06] <ajmitch> ii  nvidia-glx                            1.0.9629+2.6.19.2-1                   NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org driver
[10:06] <ajmitch> Amaranth: yep
[10:06] <zcat[1] > lrm?
[10:06] <defrysk> wiz, new nvidia-settings yes , including probing your tv and changing setting all as normal user
[10:06] <malv-laptop> would ubuntu work well in an enterprise environment?
[10:06] <ajmitch> however I'd hardly recommend people upgrade to feisty
[10:06] <zcat[1] > malv-laptop: it makes a sweet webserver
[10:06] <darko3d> No such file or directory, i got this <--- and now i can't access the folder at all
[10:06] <wiz> defrysk, Do I need to dist upgrade to edgy?
[10:07] <malv-laptop> zcat[1] , but is it stable enough?
[10:07] <malv-laptop> RHEL stable?
[10:07] <zcat[1] > dapper is..
[10:07] <malv-laptop> Currently we are debating whether to continue using CentOS, or switch to Fedora/Ubuntu
[10:08] <cari_tmen_ce> ha
[10:08] <zcat[1] >  22:07:58 up 132 days, 21:48,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00   -- seems stable enough
[10:08] <malv-laptop> there are also the aesthetics. Ubuntu default theme is bleh.
[10:08] <darko3d> nvm, i fixed that
[10:09] <zcat[1] > theme? you run a gui on your servers?!!
[10:09] <malv-laptop> they are workstations
[10:09] <fourat> which application can i use to burn CDs on ubuntu (gnome)
[10:09] <zcat[1] > ahhh...
[10:09] <malv-laptop> in a networked environment
[10:09] <zcat[1] > change the theme then... there are lots
[10:09] <tom47> fouat nautilus
[10:09] <tom47> fourat nautilus
[10:09] <malv-laptop> true, I could always do that
[10:09] <zcat[1] > not like XP is all that nice, and people use that OK
[10:09] <malv-laptop> RHEL is too out of date with many of the applications
[10:10] <malv-laptop> but its very stable and reliable
[10:10] <Guest007> fourat, I like k3b
[10:10] <Sjaakmans> Hello
[10:10] <tom47> malv-laptop how many desktops are we talking about?
[10:11] <Sjaakmans> Does somebody have aiglx running with prosavage on ubuntu?
[10:11] <Sjaakmans> I tried it but i didn't work :(
[10:11] <malv-laptop> tom47, it's just a lab of 10 in a research environment
[10:11] <nub_> how long should it take to compile wine on an athlon x2 3800?
[10:11] <jrib> malv-laptop: dapper should do well
[10:12] <noiesmo> darko3d, did you replace username with your username and /directory with the actual /directoryname
[10:12] <wiz> If I've regularly used: gksu "update-manager -c" after my dapper install a month or so ago, I'm on edgy for all intensive purposes no?
[10:12] <darko3d> yeah, nvm i fixed it, i used the command you gave again, and it worked
[10:13] <jrib> wiz: well you are either on edgy or you aren't, if you are inlimbo, you'd want to take care of that :)
[10:13] <malv-laptop> why is the latest version of ubuntu somewhat buggy?
[10:13] <wiz> jrib: I ran gksu "update-manager -c"  and clicked the "new distribution available" yes install
[10:13] <wiz> jrib, that'll put me edgy won't it?
[10:13] <malv-laptop> and I am still wondering why that nautilus bug has not been fixed yet
[10:14] <jrib> malv-laptop: less time for edgy since dapper was delayed is the main reason imo.  Also, the goals were to focus less ons tability, since dapper was there for that
[10:14] <malv-laptop> ok
[10:14] <jrib> wiz: yes, as long as it is successful
[10:14] <babo> Can I boot up ubuntu from a usb drive ?
[10:15] <jrib> babo: there's a page somewhere on the wiki about it
[10:16] <noika> Hey guys ....anyone knows how do i install a chess game?
[10:16] <tom47> malv-laptop dapper is the recommended version for production use ... it enjoys longer term support than a 'normal' release like edgy and is very very stable ... against that, like all production/stable releases you will be less than cutting edge
[10:16] <jrib> babo: this is what I have seen, there may be more: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[10:16] <malv-laptop> Ok, you guys convinced me. I will try out dapper
[10:16] <malv-laptop> In my experience, Dapper has been very good
[10:17] <jrib> noika: install gnome-chess if you are in gnome maybe
[10:17] <Vich> my ubuntu freezes at startup :/
[10:17] <sky123> malv-laptop: it is pretty stable..however the "cutting" edge features are always with the newer releases
[10:17] <osfameron> edgy seems pretty stable to me
[10:17] <jrib> noika: there are plenty of games in synaptic if you search for "chess"
[10:17] <babo> jrib: that's to install ubuntu on a pendrive. I just want to boot from a usb drive ...
[10:17] <osfameron> and some of the stuff (power management, networking) that tends to suck on linux for laptops works better on edgy
[10:17] <Kawaii-Panda> noika: try knights, its the best chess game ive seen

[10:18] <noika> panda ..where do i get that game?
[10:18] <sky123> babo: I think you'll have to play with this...but the boot.img isa key component..if you can get it on there...then have it boot of the usb you might just have success.
[10:18] <Kawaii-Panda> from synaptic

[10:19] <Kawaii-Panda> noika: open a terminal then type sudo apt-get knights
[10:20] <Beta_M> i've accidentally removed myself from sudo group... what do i do?
[10:20] <jrib> nante: best way would be if you had another debian-based computer with a net connection.  Then you could use apt-zip.  Otherwise, you'll have to manually download the debs and all the needed dependencies
[10:20] <Kawaii-Panda> noika: you can open a terminal in applications->accessories->terminal
[10:20] <sky123> nokia - System, Administration. Synaptic Package Manager
[10:20] <noika> from terminal??
[10:20] <jrib> Beta_M: reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then 'adduser user_name admin'
[10:20] <sonikku> anybody about?
[10:20] <Kawaii-Panda> noika: its the fastest way.
[10:21] <noika> i did
[10:21] <noika> it sais invalid operation knights
[10:21] <jrib> noika: you can install everything in synaptic that you can install with apt-get, the command should be  sudo apt-get install knights

[10:28] <minimec> Hi folks. After upgrading to edgy I 'lost' almost all the system fonts in scribus. The only fonts I have is Courier and Bitstream. Not really funny ... :( So anyone of you confronted with the same problem? Should I manually add the font path in the preferences?
[10:29] <nante> ah, lol, i wish somebody can point me to the right direction... i want to play rpg games this weekend
[10:29] <noika> ok now how do i edit this ''/etc/apt/sources.list''

[10:30] <umops> minimec, sure, why not just set the path.
[10:30] <GNUro> Hi!
[10:30] <Rulzern> having a rather strange problem here, when I boot, I get stuck at the second fsck (the one for /home), and it just sits there, doing nothing, if I press ctrl-alt-del I can boot, but I have to mount the /home directory manually, doing a manual fsck of that drive works fine, any ideas?
[10:31] <GNUro> what is the different about linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic and linux-image-2.6.17-10-386?
[10:31] <minimec> umops: Does that work? Why add the same path, that the x-server is loading at boot?

[10:38] <GNUro> Kawaii-Panda: PS  my english is ORRIBLE :)
[10:38] <minimec> umops: Well I don't think that it is a defoma problem. The fonts are there with all the other software... It seems to be a gnome/kde libraries issue, I guess.

[10:58] <Beta_M> hi, i've innitially removed myself from most of the groups (by accident) just now added me to 'admin' but now i'm not even asked for sudo password, which groups do i need to add myself to so that things are back to normal

[10:58] <Rulzern> having a rather strange problem here, when I boot, I get stuck at the second fsck (the one for /home), and it just sits there, doing nothing, if I press ctrl-alt-del I can boot, but I have to mount the /home directory manually, doing a manual fsck of that drive works fine, any ideas?
[10:58] <crimsun> pdz: probably not if you have a faster machine with more memory
[10:58] <Yoric> Beta_M: iirc, you don't need any group for sudo.
[10:59] <Yoric> You just need to be in the list of sudoers, in file /etc/sudoers

[11:49] <philipsmith> Hi. I installed KDE over gnome and can't get gnome to work anymore. Also, there are many other things that just aren't working any more like sound, flash, etc. I'm sort of at the end of my rope. Can I reinstall Ubuntu? How can I do this?
[11:50] <rioghal> philipsmith, kde and gnome can co-exist side-by-side. how did you install kde?
[11:50] <philipsmith> rioghal: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[11:51] <rioghal> philipsmith, wow, ive done that dozens of times and it hasnt caused a problem. you on edgy?
[11:51] <philipsmith> rioghal: Dapper
[11:52] <rioghal> philipsmith, thats weird
[11:52] <philipsmith> rioghal: Can I just back up my data and reinstall Ubuntu from the CD?
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3
[11:53] <rioghal> philipsmith, sure you can, but before you go through all that work, are you willing to get rid of kde?
[11:53] <darko3d> just noticed that, i'll try it and get back to you
[11:53] <philipsmith> rioghal: KDE must go. It is not at all wife-friendly.
[11:53] <rioghal> philipsmith, have a look at this page: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome
[11:54] <Rulzern> can't you just set gnome as the default session in gdm?
[11:54] <rioghal> philipsmith, i have used that to rid my system of all kde stuff and return to gnome

[11:55] <philipsmith> riogal: Are you certain? If I uninstall KDE, I fear I wont have any desktop at all!
[11:56] <rioghal> philipsmith, also, you might want to look into using aptitude instead of apt-get as aptitude will uninstall the app *and* all the files that were installed with it whereas apt-get on dapper wont uninstall all the other files
[11:56] <incorrect> i've just confused my system to use winbind, but for some strange reason xscreensaver crashes when i lock the terminal
[11:57] <LeSfOlIeSdEpIgAl> hello!
[11:57] <rioghal> philipsmith, well, it worked for me, but that isnt saying much. you should back everything up first just in case and be prepared for the worst since that problem seems unusual

[12:00] <rioghal> thank you crimsun
[12:00] <rioghal> philipsmith, thats good because aptitude wont do it because you installed it with apt-get
[12:01] <philipsmith> rioghal: What am I supposed to do? I don't seem to be able to do anything.
[12:01] <rioghal> philipsmith, aptitude only works that way with apps you installed with aptitude

[12:02] <rioghal> philipsmith, i dont know, that setup and problem sounds like the result of a bigger problem
[12:02] <jago25_98> I'm getting a different page in Windows to the page in Ubuntu with firefox. No DNS cache to flush?
[12:03] <sky123> if you must remove configs after removal with apt-get remove then maybe the dpkg --purge packagename will help
[12:04] <rioghal> jago25_98, windows probably saw that you went to a linux site and gave you the page M$ wants you to see.. they used to do that a lot with the opera browser on windows

[12:10] <rioghal> all4n, gnomebaker can do that easily.. do you have gnomebaker installed?
[12:10] <all4n> if I use windows w/Nero Burning Rom, the cd is nicely copied as nrg file which I can convert to ISO..  just wondering why dd is not working, it should work better than Nero, right?
[12:11] <rausb0> all4n: how did you use dd?
[12:12] <all4n> rasub0: yeah
[12:12] <rausb0> all4n: _how_ did you use dd?
[12:13] <all4n> rioghal: yes, I tried gnomebaker also

[12:13] <all4n> rausb0: dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/allan/Desktop/myFile.iso
[12:13] <rausb0> all4n: is it a audio cd?
[12:13] <rioghal> all4n, well rauble might be able to help you with dd, if that fails i can walk you through it with gnomebaker

[12:14] <all4n> rioghal: sure, thanks
[12:14] <rioghal> all4n, oh, ok, disregard my last post
[12:14] <rausb0> all4n: vcd cannot be copied with dd
[12:14] <all4n> rausb0: oh..
[12:14] <darko3d> ok, so what should i use, Xgl, or AIGLX
[12:14] <rioghal> all4n, i dont think gnomebaker would do a vcd either
[12:14] <all4n> why is Nero able to but not those?
[12:15] <rausb0> all4n: i think vcds have more than one session
[12:15] <all4n> I thought dd would be block-level copying?
[12:15] <all4n> rausb0: oh
[12:16] <rausb0> all4n: and IIRC, vcd don't have the normal block size (2048 bytes)
[12:16] <rioghal> all4n, we can try it with gnomebaker but im not making any promises
[12:16] <all4n> rioghal: I have tried already  :)  thanks
[12:16] <rioghal> ok
[12:16] <rausb0> all4n: dd can only handle data cds, not vcds or audio cds.
[12:17] <all4n> rioghal and rausb0: I just read there is one called vcdimager..  I'll try that
[12:17] <rioghal> all4n, oh yeah, i saw that in the repos

[12:18] <all4n> rioghal & rausb0: thanks guys..   wife calling, I'll look into vcdimager when I get back later

[12:44] <valehru_laptop> yeah, i have a 4318 on a different machine....I can get it working perfectly in Dapper but not in edgy, I have since brought all my machines back to dapper...much more stable for my hardware it would seem
[12:44] <gotit> one thing more i installed another OS pluging another hard drive in the sys, windows has detected it and there are two windows xp options shown there, i have removed 1 from windows bootmanager how to remove it from grub
[12:44] <valehru_laptop> scheuri, what distro are you using?
[12:45] <valehru_laptop> and whats the card?
[12:45] <Juftus> scheuri: No, it isn't pointing to that. Didn't try Ndiswrapper. I quite rarely actually need wifi, and when I do, I just then boot into Windows.
[12:45] <wolf> gaim crashes a few seconds after i log in... anyone know why? Im on Dapper, fully updated. # gaim -d gives lots of output including:
[12:45] <wolf> g_log: gaim_base64_decode: assertion `text != NULL' failed
[12:45] <wolf> Gaim has segfaulted and attempted to dump a core file.
[12:46] <scheuri> valehru_laptop: I am using (k)ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper) and I am NOT using wlan regularly...
[12:46] <rausb0> gotit: the windows sections in grub's menu.lst usually contain a line "chainloader +1"
[12:46] <scheuri> valehru_laptop: it was just a suggestions
[12:46] <scheuri> *suggestion
[12:46] <valehru_laptop> scheuri, whats your network card?
[12:46] <scheuri> valehru_laptop: uhmm...good question...PCMCIA 3Com...
[12:46] <Juftus> valehru_laptop, OK, thanks for the tip. I'm on Edgy now.
[12:46] <valehru_laptop> I used fwcutter on this machine before, was only 11mbps...not good.
[12:46] <gotit> scheuri: ok , now how to edit it
[12:46] <scheuri> gotit: do NOT ask me...:)
[12:47] <gotit> lol
[12:47] <scheuri> gotit: as I have no idea what you are speaking of...;)
[12:47] <gotit> heh
[12:48] <scheuri> wolf: did that happen after you added some accounts?
[12:48] <gotit> i have to remove 1 "windows xp professional" option from the boot menu of grub
[12:48] <scheuri> wolf: oh wait...you are on 64bit? sorry....can't help you then
[12:49] <rausb0> gotit: why did you insert the second harddisk anyway?
[12:49] <gotit> aha , you know.... to do some nasty work lol
[12:49] <valehru_laptop> brb, hopefully this works.
[12:49] <scheuri> here we go...some nice answer...:)
[12:50] <wolf> scheuri: I dont think so... though it may have happened only since upgrading to dapper (usually use gaim at work not here at home). No Im not on 64bit (not at home anyway :-) ) Why did u think that?
[12:50] <soundray> scheuri: it doesn't say that. Base64 is just an encoding scheme, like uuencode
[12:51] <scheuri> wolf: I thought so because I misread your error message...beg your pardon....(like soundray said)
[12:51] <wolf> ok

[12:52] <rausb0> i will not support any windows related things
[12:52] <sorush20> I have a problem with kubuntu wpa
[12:52] <gotit> its not widows i have to remove it from grub menus
[12:52] <sorush20> is there a really good how to on it?
[12:52] <wolf> scheuri: havent tried that. will try now.
[12:52] <scheuri> !wpa
[12:52] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[12:52] <gotit> already removed it from window menu but its still in grub
[12:53] <scheuri> however, I can not really determine what "really good" means to you
[12:53] <soundray> gotit: you've been told before, you need to edit your menu.lst. If you don't know how, you've got some reading to do.
[12:53] <rausb0> gotit: so why don't you boot from cd and fix it?
[12:53] <gotit> i have the grub boot cd , should i just boot from it and auto repair it
[12:53] <gotit> ??
[12:54] <sorush20> this is not working for me  wpa_passphrase NetworkEssid, I have substituted the NetworkEssid with my Essid but still no use
[12:54] <rausb0> gotit: no, not auto repair it. boot it and edit the grub config file.
[12:54] <sorush20> it just hangs what can I do /
[12:54] <gotit> ok
[12:54] <scheuri> gotit: you may also just tell your admin the truth and let him help you fix it
[12:54] <gotit> but i need some more direction to manually repairing the grub config file
[12:54] <gotit> no no NA
[12:55] <scheuri> gotit: I was just saying
[12:55] <Hobbsee> sorush20: then type in your passphrase.
[12:55] <gotit> ok :)
[12:55] <keithhhhh> Can anyone tell me how to format a new disk to fat32??
[12:56] <Hobbsee> sorush20: which is why it says "# reading passphrase from stdin"
[12:56] <valehru> gah...didnt work.
[12:56] <scheuri> keithhhhh: is it mounted? does cfdisk see the disk?
[12:56] <lastnode__> keithhhhh, mkdosfs
[12:57] <rausb0> gotit: do you have any knowledge of the unix command line?
[12:57] <sorush20> Hobbsee: I have a BeBox from bethere.co.uk, they send the box with wpa psk encryption to me
[12:57] <keithhhhh> scheuri: I think it is
[12:57] <gotit> rausb0: how could i edit the grub config file
[12:57] <gotit> nopw
[12:57] <sorush20> its a key that is hex decimal
[12:57] <rausb0> gotit: then its gonna be hard...
[12:57] <scheuri> gotit: well, in this case....tell your admin the truth and let him help you fix it
[12:57] <gotit> i can do it :)
[12:57] <Hobbsee> sorush20: right, so why are you trying to generate the passphrase for it, if you've already got the key?

[12:59] <Hobbsee> sorush20: if you already have the key, you may as well take what it is, and keep following the instructions
[12:59] <Janchi> a BeBox? Wow, a cool piece of history
[01:00] <mnepton> Hobbit or PPC?
[01:00] <Hobbsee> sorush20: so you've got something like ae51d980bbd3827ac042dd02762a99aa154118c2112705f9a45689b595361e15, so put it in the file where it says psk=

[01:01] <gotit> oh
[01:01] <mikl> mchonis: will that is possible, it is ruinous to your sound quality
[01:01] <mikl> s/will/while/
[01:01] <gotit> now thats a prob
[01:01] <scheuri> wolf: actually it is not that scary (however, it really scared me too the first time)...."ubuntu-desktop" is not a real package
[01:01] <rausb0> gotit: if i have to fix things, i boot my own live cd
[01:01] <scheuri> wolf: it is a virtual one which links several packages together
[01:02] <scheuri> wolf: easily spoken
[01:02] <bimberi> !ubuntu-desktop
[01:02] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[01:02] <mchonis> so theres no way to convert to decent sounding mp3s?
[01:02] <Janchi> sorush20: oops, it's not the ancient BeBox but something else. too bad
[01:02] <scheuri> wolf: now...you installed ubuntu-desktop with all the linked packages that belongs to that virtual package...
[01:02] <gotit> http://freshmeat.net/projects/supergrub/
[01:02] <scheuri> wolf: and now you are removing one...meaning that you do NOT have ubuntu-desktop anymore on your desktop but your OWN specific configuration
[01:03] <scheuri> wolf: that is why it is removed as well
[01:03] <mikl> mchonis: there is no easy way (that I know of) - you'll probably have to do some commandline wizardry with sox and other things
[01:03] <scheuri> wolf: it is just not "ubuntu-desktop" anymore without gaim....therefore that virtual package is delete was well

[01:05] <skizm> man i just spent 2 hours trying to get the live cd install to work, i had what seems to be a common problem with ati cards, and i followed a tutorial on how to fix it...  but the tutorial had an error ;/
[01:05] <skizm> To do this restart the live-cd and press F6 and remove "quiet splash --" from the boot options. Now you will get a command prompt when X fails to start. Once you are at the command prompt type "nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and locate the line "ati" and exchange it for "radeon". Save and start X by typing "startx".
[01:05] <Hobbsee> skizm: what was the error?
[01:05] <Hobbsee> skizm: x didnt start?
[01:05] <ashiaka> ..
[01:05] <skizm> sure, sounds simple enough..  it took me 40 minutes to realize i should use sudo to get access to save the file
[01:06] <skizm> yes, that was the problem
[01:06] <rafael> How can I get Samba
[01:06] <skizm> i fixed it now, i guess : \

[01:06] <sorush20> its noly about 6 digits
[01:06] <rausb0> gotit: i guess it won't help you
[01:06] <Hobbsee> sorush20: that'd be the passphrase.
[01:07] <gotit> and it can autorepair the grub bootloader
[01:07] <rausb0> gotit: i don't trust things like "autorepair"
[01:07] <rausb0> gotit: usually they make things worse
[01:07] <gotit> aah so what do you suggest than
[01:07] <rafael> Do I get to install it from the Terminal screen
[01:08] <rafael> ???
[01:08] <Hobbsee> rafael: or from synaptic
[01:08] <rausb0> gotit: you have have a live cd like damn small linux or knoppix around?

[01:11] <rausb0> gotit: well, i don't know this super grub cd, so i cant tell you how to reinstall grub with it

[01:35] <hyakuhei> hey all, should I be worried that "aptitude remove brltty" wants to remove "ubuntu-desktop" ?
[01:35] <bimberi> !ubuntu-desktop | hyakuhei
[01:35] <ubotu> hyakuhei: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[01:36] <hyakuhei> thanks bimberi

[01:41] <gotit> bienremi : what do you want
[01:42] <bienremi> nothing
[01:42] <skizm> Fawk3: is that after installation?

[01:42] <skizm> oh
[01:42] <Fawk3> :(
[01:42] <wijnand> go tit: it's probably a matter of setting the active partition
[01:42] <gotit> whats the latest version of grub
[01:42] <skizm> do you have an ati card
[01:43] <Fawk3> yeah
[01:43] <gotit> wijnand: ok how can i solve the prob
[01:43] <luisbg> since the ubuntu installation cd is live... there is no live cd? (have to use one to extract the data of a broken computer)

[01:44] <gotit> wijnand: can it be done with the super grub cd
[01:44] <wijnand> no clue
[01:44] <wijnand> i have never heard of super grub
[01:44] <gotit> Super Grub Disk is a bootable floppy or CDROM that is oriented towards system rescue, specifically for repairing the booting process. Super Grub Disk is simply a Grub Disk with a lot of useful menus. It can activate partitions, boot partitions, boot MBRs, boot your former OS (Linux or another one) by loading menu.lst from your hard disk, automatically restore Grub on your MBR, swap hard disks in the BIOS, and boot from any available disk d

[01:57] <tfny_> Hi, is there an software availiable like webalizer which can handle simpler log files like the ip+referer so I only can list hits/visits/referer ? because if i use webalizer I need the whole apache access log which gets very big after a day on my server :)
[01:57] <dilll> wijnand, but i need beryl :(
[01:57] <wijnand> need?
[01:58] <kliklik> wijnand, sorry, no.. was on irc so I've thought just to pop in and ask :)
[01:58] <joejaxx> tfny_: hello
[01:58] <dilll> yes beryl is so so beutiful
[01:58] <joejaxx> tfny_: webalizer - Web server log analysis program
[01:58] <joejaxx> tfny_: yes there is
[01:58] <joejaxx> :)
[01:59] <joejaxx> tfny_: oh nevermind you want an alternative

[01:59] <leafw> any clues on how to have applications put their menu at the top, fixed, a-la-macosx?
[01:59] <leafw> for gnome that is
[01:59] <joejaxx> leafw: i do not think that is possible
[02:00] <leafw> joejaxx : er, kde can, now that's surprising
[02:00] <joejaxx> leafw: maybe there is a panel applet that i am not aware of
[02:00] <tfny_> joejaxx, the problem is that webalizer only uses the "combined" log-format from the apache, but this log format is too big for me, the log files are getting to big :-/
[02:00] <wijnand> leafw that can't be done
[02:00] <rausb0> leafw: kde can do that only for its own apps
[02:01] <rafael> Hello
[02:01] <joejaxx> wijnand: yeah that is what i though
[02:01] <joejaxx> thought*
[02:01] <rafael> I whant to install swat
[02:01] <wijnand> leafw that is a QT vs GTK thing
[02:01] <joejaxx> tfny_: :(
[02:01] <leafw> oh well, thanks guys
[02:01] <rafael> How can I do that
[02:01] <rafael> ?
[02:01] <wijnand> sure
[02:01] <joejaxx> leafw: you are most welcome
[02:01] <joejaxx> rafael: that is a game right?
[02:02] <wijnand> rafael have you tried the package manager?
[02:02] <rafael> no
[02:02] <leafw> kde has way more functionality, but the gnome is way easier to use ... but kde consumes like ALL resources, and gnome takes a much smaller chunk ... endless back and forth.
[02:02] <rafael> I can do it olso into the terminal
[02:02] <joejaxx> ahhh
[02:02] <irax> /#linux
[02:02] <wijnand> leafw i know what you mean
[02:02] <joejaxx> rafael: it is a samba tool
[02:02] <irax> #linux
[02:02] <wijnand> leafw my easy solution was to buy a mac ;)
[02:02] <rafael> but the package manager is easier
[02:03] <leafw> wijnand : I own macs, great hardware. But I run ubuntu on them.
[02:03] <rafael> Yes
[02:03] <rafael> Ive already instald Samba
[02:03] <wijnand> leafw you use ubuntu on recent macs too?
[02:03] <leafw> wijnand : macosx is even worse than KDE in resource consumption. You can't even run java with 98% percent of all ram without paging beyond 70%
[02:04] <rafael> and smbfs
[02:04] <leafw> wijnand : on core 2 duos? Haven't tried
[02:04] <joejaxx> tfny_: i do not know :( analog? awstats?
[02:04] <wijnand> leafw: i have an iMac G5... runs nicely (until i start playing games)
[02:04] <leafw> wijnand : but considering they are x86 ,it should run just the same (graphics cards who knows)
[02:04] <tfny_> joejaxx, jepp have found awstats, looking great
[02:04] <joejaxx> tfny_: :D
[02:04] <wijnand> leafw: the graphics on the intel macs are either ati or intel, they should work fine
[02:05] <leafw> wijnand: G5 machine is what torvalds uses for developemnt, I've heard.
[02:05] <luisbg> if I want to take the data out the hd of a computer with a broken OS, using the ubuntu cd is a good idea (run it live, copy the data to a safe place and then formating the hd)?

[02:05] <luisbg> geokok, cinelerra, but it's not in ubuntu/debian yet

[02:05] <wijnand> leafw i want a macbook
[02:05] <luisbg> wijnand, me too

[02:06] <joejaxx> oh wait dvd?
[02:06] <luisbg> joejaxx, yeah... kino is nice too
[02:06] <joejaxx> geokok: hmm hold that thought
[02:07] <leafw> wijnand : in my experience, macosx is not worth using until at the latest release, i.e. 10.2.8, 10.3.9, 10.4.8 ... all previous versions are buggy like hell, exposed mostly in RAM and performance-demanding apps.
[02:07] <geokok> geokok_81: same nic..same age?? same country maybe??
[02:07] <joejaxx> luisbg: his camcorder records to dvds
[02:07] <leafw> wijnand : so I won't run leopard until, like, december 2007
[02:07] <luisbg> joejaxx, oooooh
[02:07] <luisbg> leafw, what's the actual version of panther?
[02:07] <wijnand> leafw hehe
[02:07] <leafw> luisbg : 10.3.9 at the moment
[02:08] <luisbg> leafw, stable! =)

[02:08] <geokok> joejaxx: ok am waiting patiently :)
[02:08] <luisbg> joejaxx, ffmpeg to pass the dvd to quality avi?
[02:08] <joejaxx> luisbg: maybe
[02:09] <leafw> wijnand : try to run java apps. Try to run python apps. Try to run webservers with perl/php scripts. Try to use Adobde CS 2 Photoshop with 1Gb images.

[02:11] <wijnand> leafw: you mean in the java they supply?
[02:11] <iwkse> leafw: isn't jave just slow?
[02:11] <cheesy> darkbishop: sudo apt-get install wine
[02:11] <wijnand> leafw so would it help to just download java straight from sun?
[02:11] <leafw> wijnand : in my experience, java apps are between 1.5x and 2x compared to C++
[02:11] <joejaxx> darkbishop: that has alot of documentation :D
[02:11] <leafw> wijnand : java from sun doesn't run on macs.
[02:11] <joejaxx> darkbishop: you might want to run wincfg after you install it
[02:12] <joejaxx> geokok: you are probably going to want to convert the dvd video into another format and then import it into kino
[02:12] <darkbishop> joejaxx:but there is no wincfg???

[02:28] <iwkse> syntaxx: ok
[02:28] <Sp4rKy> hi
[02:28] <dilll> hi
[02:28] <voidmage> That way if stuff breaks and you have to reinstall, you'll still have all your stuff
[02:28] <iwkse> syntaxx: do you have 1GB ram?
[02:28] <Sp4rKy> please, i've some issue during sympa mailing lmist manager configuration
[02:29] <NickVolt> anybody have any suggestions for server monitoring software? I need to be able to configure it to attempt a connection on a certain port.... ?
[02:29] <Rico> Help, about bluetooth keyboard on ubuntu LTS.
[02:29] <skizm> what the hell?  it booted this time without me changing anything o_O
[02:29] <skizm> oh well i won't complain
[02:29] <Sp4rKy> when i try to do  /etc/init.d/sympa start, i get the error "Missing files"
[02:29] <syntaxx> voidmage: its ok.. this will just a desktop install im using freebsd just wanna mess up with beryl lol
[02:29] <Sp4rKy> but there's nothing in the log :/
[02:29] <syntaxx> iwkse: yes
[02:29] <nownot> ok well right now my sata drives are sda and sdb and sdb is hd0, will sda be hd1 and first ide drive be hd2
[02:29] <Sp4rKy> does anyone can help me please ?
[02:29] <nofxx> hey....now that every thing was running cool.... just restarted my pc and ubuntu dosent show things... I have to pass the mouse to go "revealing" the screen........arggg.. any idea ?!!?
[02:29] <nofxx> gnome
[02:30] <syntaxx> voidmage: and by the way cedega's .deb works here fine right?
[02:30] <voidmage> nownot: all sata drives are sd*
[02:30] <nofxx> and when I close, i need to go again passing the mouse to clean what was there
[02:30] <nofxx> close some window, i mean
[02:30] <luisbg> when I launched the ubuntu cd it hasn't mounted me the hard drive of the computer?
[02:30] <voidmage> syntaxx: should work
[02:30] <voidmage> most debian packages work fine on ubuntu
[02:30] <nownot> yes i know but in grub root is hd0 and it boots so when i add the ide drive for boot what should the correct root
[02:31] <Janchi> luisbg: that is correct, It should work that way
[02:31] <Janchi> luisbg: Why do you want to mount the harddrive?
[02:31] <luisbg> Janchi, because I need to make a backup of the files on it
[02:33] <voidmage> if i want to replace my monitor, it's just as simple as plugging in the new one and dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[02:33] <Sp4rKy> pleasse
[02:33] <Janchi> luisbg: May I make a suggestion then? Better use Knoppix. It automounts all partitions and has good NTFS support
[02:33] <luisbg> Janchi, true
[02:34] <voidmage> isn't ntfs-3g a good driver now?
[02:34] <PriceChild> voidmage: matter of opinion
[02:34] <PriceChild> voidmage: be careful
[02:34] <PriceChild> voidmage: all NTFS write support may be considered "dodgy"
[02:35] <syncmaster> i have't yet destroyed anything with ntfs-3g yet :-)
[02:35] <Janchi> PriceChild: true, but for backup purposes it is sufficient
[02:35] <iwkse> neither me
[02:35] <l3on_> excuse me, but the grive's repository is too able ? for dapper
[02:35] <l3on_> for edgy are down
[02:36] <iwkse> syncmaster: if you wanna some crash or similar..try with amule and give the incoming path to a ntfs partition
[02:36] <Janchi> iwkse: yikes, you are bad
[02:37] <iwkse> :)
[02:37] <syntaxx> voidmage: ok after the 100% i just need to reboot right?
[02:37] <darkbishop> ano... minasan. im just wondering.. if i install a game using wine.. where do the file been keep?
[02:38] <syncmaster> iwkse: I have made some simple copy/delete stuff, not that kind of yet.
[02:38] <iwkse> syncmaster: copy, delete, move..works great
[02:38] <iwkse> syncmaster: but i guess when it is stressed...
[02:38] <syncmaster> I have noticed that
[02:38] <Janchi> darkbishop: in a hidden file in your /home/user folder: .wine
[02:38] <darkbishop> Janchi:oh ok.. thx
[02:39] <Janchi> darkbishop: each container will have its own folder
[02:39] <deusjevoo> is the whole game put inthere?
[02:40] <deusjevoo> or just some wine things ?
[02:40] <Janchi> deusjevoo: yep, just like under windows
[02:40] <deusjevoo> can't you set that to another drive?
[02:40] <voidmage> ~/.wine/Program\ Files\blah
[02:40] <Discerer> so I was wondering about FTP
[02:40] <Discerer> what's the easiest way to set up an FTP on a generic ubuntu 6.05 installation?
[02:40] <Janchi> deusjevoo: I think so, but I never bothered with it.
[02:41] <nathansnook7> Can someone explain how to figure out why events/0 take up allot of system resources?
[02:41] <voidmage> How can I import my firefox profile fron windows?
[02:41] <Janchi> deusjevoo: but since you can tailor anything you like in Linux
[02:41] <deusjevoo> well, just still in the works for looking a good ditsro for me to use
[02:41] <felixjet> anyone have installed the murrine themes succesfull? i do as the manual say but i cant get it working at 100% :(
[02:41] <Janchi> voidmage: should be easy: just copy it from the win directory and put in in the hidden FF folder
[02:41] <deusjevoo> good to see some practical questions come by
[02:42] <voidmage> alright
[02:42] <voidmage> wouldn't happen to know if anything in user.js or another file would need some edits?
[02:42] <devilsadvocate> for what?
[02:42] <voidmage> for importing my firefox profile from windows
[02:43] <Janchi> voidmage: I have a thread in my blog about that http://opensourcelearning.info/blog/?cat=8&paged=3
[02:43] <voidmage> thanks

[02:43] <Guardian> hi, what's different between a package for 6.06 and a package for 6.10 ?
[02:44] <Janchi> voidmage: even the extensions should work
[02:44] <deusjevoo> isn't there a Dutch Ubuntu?
[02:44] <devilsadvocate> Guardian, they are built with the rest of the distro in mind
[02:44] <Janchi> deusjevoo: you can select dutch as a language during install
[02:44] <raghu206> how to copy video cds in ubuntu it says i/o error pls some one help
[02:45] <Discerer> what's the easiest way to set up an FTP on a generic ubuntu 6.06 installation?
[02:45] <Janchi> deusjevoo: during bootup it is either F2 or F4
[02:45] <Janchi> deusjevoo: but you see it: language
[02:46] <deusjevoo> and the endresult is completely Dutch version?
[02:46] <devilsadvocate> Discerer, have you looked at ubuntuguide.org ?
[02:46] <Guardian> devilsadvocate: hmm well ok, for instance i was about to install a nighty build for codeblocks, i don't think there is much difference between 6.06 and 6.10
[02:46] <Janchi> deusjevoo: exactly
[02:46] <darkbishop> ntfs-3g dont work..
[02:46] <kouyujie> does anyone can help me about bluetooth keyboard?
[02:46] <deusjevoo> thanks, curious, also possible to switch between languages after install?
[02:46] <Janchi> deusjevoo: give or take a few menu items here and there
[02:46] <devilsadvocate> Guardian, that would depend ont he dependancies. if one of the packages they depend on has a significant change that could cause breakage
[02:46] <Janchi> deusjevoo: as many languages as you like
[02:47] <Janchi> deusjevoo: it is all part of the systems menu
[02:47] <Discerer> no thanks for the tip devilsadvocate
[02:47] <deusjevoo> and those can be set in an installed version?
[02:47] <deusjevoo> cool
[02:47] <Janchi> deusjevoo: you can add and remove the languages as your needs change
[02:47] <darkbishop> i cant find make command.. help anyone
[02:48] <darkbishop> what is the command for mounting an ntfs system so it can be read/write.. rite now i only mount it in read only
[02:48] <eitch0000> I installed kpowersave, and didn't reboot, then started the app. CPU Scaling worked like a charm, now I rebooted and now cpu scaling isn't even in the menu anymore. Does it have anything to do with the fact, that installing kpowersave removed apmd and powernowd?
[02:48] <Janchi> darkbishop: you have to install make
[02:48] <Pupeno> Can I add feeds to liferea from Firefox ?
[02:48] <Janchi> darkbishop: it is not there by default
[02:48] <PecisDarbs> how to install Intel WiFi for my laptop?
[02:48] <visik7> anyone here with dapper ?
[02:48] <Guardian> devilsadvocate: ok
[02:48] <Janchi> visik7: many
[02:49] <Guardian> devilsadvocate: thx for the explanation
[02:49] <deusjevoo> my english is good enough, but the distro i'm going to be used will probably also be used by non-techie friends, family, for cheap pcs, so flexibility is a big plus

[02:49] <darkbishop> Janchi:soka!!!! ok i get back to you...
[02:49] <Janchi> deusjevoo: you should look into rekonstruktor then. You can make custom Ubuntu versions for your friends
[02:50] <visik7> mdnsd isn't present in edgy
[02:50] <visik7> anyone have it in dapper ?
[02:50] <deusjevoo> my idea is more of setting up a system, tweak it, then image it
[02:50] <deusjevoo> then use that image for the others to
[02:50] <deusjevoo> time.....
[02:50] <deusjevoo> is not on my side
[02:50] <Janchi> deusjevoo: that works nice if the hardware is alike
[02:50] <deusjevoo> and if not, if necessary, change recompile kernel I suppos?
[02:51] <deusjevoo> e
[02:51] <Janchi> deusjevoo: http://opensourcelearning.info/blog/?p=54 is how I did it
[02:51] <deusjevoo> I'm doing those things allready with xp/2000
[02:51] <syntax1> how to install nvidia drivers in ubuntu? i cant get the resolution that i want
[02:51] <Janchi> deusjevoo: Rekonstruktor extract the CD/DVD, you add everything you like (or remove), customize the whole thing and you have a fine install DVD
[02:52] <DiMiTRiS> Is there a way to make openoffice use 2 dictionaries at the same time like evolution does/

[02:52] <deusjevoo> well, if install doesn't take muchlonger then putting an image back...
[02:52] <qailer> Hello guys, I recently upgraded my grandfather to edgy but now I got problems building the fglrx kernel source(etc) from the 8.31.5, before the upgrade he was doing quite fine with opensource radeon drivers, he's got a radeon x300, now xorg won't start at all, aw, is this a known problem or do I miss any packages etc, this is the output I get: http://paste.uni.cc/11618
[02:52] <Janchi> deusjevoo: how does 20 minutes sound
[02:52] <deusjevoo> fine
[02:52] <deusjevoo> :-)
[02:53] <deusjevoo> that's like a quickie :-)
[02:53] <Janchi> deusjevoo: ech wel. When I had a problem with Ubuntu it was faster to reinstall than to look for the problem and solve it
[02:53] <KomiaPoika> how can i set up nat without using iptables
[02:54] <deusjevoo> that leads to another question
[02:54] <syntax1> how to install nvidia drivers in ubuntu? i cant get the resolution that i want
[02:54] <Janchi> deusjevoo: shout it out
[02:54] <deusjevoo> what you did, what about userfiles? mails? p2p programs?
[02:54] <deusjevoo> no need to backup first?
[02:55] <Janchi> deusjevoo: the easiest thing is to create a separate partition for /home
[02:55] <deusjevoo> my wininstalls now have profiles set to another partition, D: mostly
[02:55] <Discerer> hmm the ftp server guide on ubuntuguide.org doesn't say how to add users to the ftp server. anyone know?
[02:55] <Jural> Small problem, I had to install ubuntu from command line. GDM isn't starting by default, I can set that up, but console 1 is auto loging in as root. which rc level is this running in for ubuntu?
[02:55] <deusjevoo> so, install, image, problems: restore image, clean out docs and settins, and set to go again
[02:55] <Janchi> deusjevoo: that way you can mount the /home during install and keep all your data
[02:55] <deusjevoo> ok
[02:55] <syntax1> hello? is there a guide on how to install nvidia drivers in ubuntu?
[02:56] <deusjevoo> good lecture about all that practical things?

[02:56] <syntax1> Janchi: easyubuntu?
[02:57] <fnf> syntax1: You'd better look at ubuntuguide.org
[02:57] <Janchi> deusjevoo: well, there is more in my blog. I kept track of all my endeavors. Another one is digiplace.nl. He and I are writing a book on Ubuntu Linux in dutch

[02:58] <deusjevoo> Janchi, link for your blog?
[02:58] <Janchi> deusjevoo: http://opensourcelearning.info/blog/?cat=8
[02:58] <voidmage> how do you get easyubuntu to work on edgy?
[02:58] <fnf> syntax1: It depends on how you'd want to install the driver. You may just download the nvidia-glx package or do it the hard way.

[03:01] <FerchoLP2> Hello. I'm setting a firewall whose only function is to implement NAT and let PCs from lan to access websites. I set all iptables policys DROP. Then, "sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 10.0.50.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE" (192.168.0.0/24 is in this case what emulates internet).
[03:01] <FerchoLP2> then, I add this rule: "sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.0.50.0/24 -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT"
[03:02] <FerchoLP2> but http packages are not going through the firewall. Do you know what rule is missing?
[03:03] <deusjevoo> Janchi: very likely
[03:03] <deusjevoo> you give me discount?
[03:03] <deusjevoo> haha

[03:04] <devilsadvocate> Aberry, top?
[03:04] <Aberry> top what Im sorry?
[03:04] <Janchi> deusjevoo: just a cheap Rotterdammer here
[03:04] <deusjevoo> which publisher?
[03:04] <devilsadvocate> did you see if there is a runaway process in top?

[03:04] <MtJB> evidently rt61pci does not work in edgy, how can i install the dapper version, which i have read, does work?
[03:04] <erider> how do I get opengl working on my 64bit system?
[03:05] <kouyujie> sigh
[03:05] <Janchi> deusjevoo: we are still discussing the title. They want "Linux op de PC" , we want "Warempel... het werkt. Linux voor overstappers"
[03:05] <Aberry> youll have to forgive me on that one, this is only the second linux distro I've tried :S Im using them both as dns servers so they're running BIND and, though using the desktop is slow, it seems to be quite quick at serving names still
[03:06] <Aberry> Im not sure how to check for runaway processes
[03:06] <deusjevoo> title can be important to attract right group
[03:06] <MtJB> Aberry:  first, you have to shout "whoa, whoa, big fella"
[03:06] <devilsadvocate> Aberry, open a terminal, and type top
[03:06] <Janchi> deusjevoo: definitely. Their title is..... booooooorrrriinnngggg. We want to attract the Windows power users
[03:06] <Aberry> ok, brb then
[03:06] <deusjevoo> why not: "Linux op de pc" with subtitle "Warempel, het werkt" ?
[03:06] <Misnix2> linux in een wippie
[03:06] <deusjevoo> nice layout

[03:07] <Janchi> LOL
[03:07] <Misnix2> lol
[03:07] <Janchi> deusjevoo: good suggestion. I'll pass that on

[03:08] <deusjevoo> on what are you writing the book? linux? or windoze?
[03:09] <Misnix2> linux. thuis, uit en op het werk

[03:09] <darkbishop> oh damn.. no english?

[03:09] <devilsadvocate> what is the cpu usage?
[03:09] <devilsadvocate> top left somewhere
[03:09] <deusjevoo> recent Mac?
[03:09] <devilsadvocate> the total cpu usage
[03:09] <Aberry> let me go and see
[03:10] <Janchi> deusjevoo: I have to be. I write mostly for OS migrants. In run Win XP and Vista, Mac OS X and Ubuntu at the moment
[03:10] <devilsadvocate> hang on a sec
[03:10] <Janchi> deusjevoo: OS X on an older iMac Indigo
[03:10] <devilsadvocate> you may as well look at the memory use as well
[03:10] <Aberry> around 7-11% total usage on idle

[03:10] <honk> Is there a PCMCIA laptop wireless card that is known to well work automagically with Ubuntu?
[03:10] <devilsadvocate> then it shouldnt be sluggish
[03:10] <devilsadvocate> how much ram do you have again?
[03:10] <deusjevoo> offcourse, I'm giving lots of support for windows, wanna do Linux to now
[03:11] <devilsadvocate> honk, there are, but i dont remember which
[03:11] <Aberry> hmmm this might be why, i only have 12mb free of physical memory and nothing is being used of the swap
[03:11] <Aberry> does the swap only kick in when physical memory is used up?
[03:11] <devilsadvocate> type h, it'll give you instructions on using top
[03:11] <Aberry> 256mb
[03:11] <honk> Perhaps those of the Linksys brand?
[03:11] <l3on_> excuse me, why does not command convert work ?
[03:11] <deusjevoo> learn it first offcourse, but grew up with puters
[03:11] <devilsadvocate> try ordering the processies based on mem usage
[03:11] <Janchi> deusjevoo: Ubuntu is a good solution for migrants, easy to use and extend
[03:12] <l3on_> anyone ?
[03:12] <quiet> i thought you said immigrants.
[03:12] <Janchi> deusjevoo: problem solving is still a killer for most users
[03:12] <quiet> lol
[03:12] <deusjevoo> well, narrowed it down to suse, ubuntu, mandriva, fedora
[03:12] <Aberry> ok, give me one minute
[03:12] <deusjevoo> that's why I wanna get it under my knees first
[03:12] <Pupeno> is there some way to wrap a 'make install' so it generates some kind of package that can be easily uninstalled ? to keep my system clean.

[03:14] <quiet> geokok, no, it's ctrl+alt+F#
[03:14] <Pupeno> geokok: if you are in X, you need to press ctrl-alt- to get out.

[03:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mad-wifi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:15] <Khamael> when will the latest nvidia drivers be in ubuntu?
[03:15] <Aberry> quiet, Im not sure it is as my swap file isnt being used at all
[03:15] <quiet> !madwifi
[03:15] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:15] <Acke_ubu> quiet: thanks'
[03:16] <Kawaii-Panda> Khamael: the next release, feisty would have the binary drivers by default :)
[03:16] <quiet> Aberry, that's good... your swap shouldn't be getting used. if it is, then you need more RAM...  what you're seeing is cached RAM...
[03:16] <geokok> quiet: How can I boot my machine in text mode?
[03:17] <devilsadvocate> geokok, select single user mode while booting up in grub
[03:17] <quiet> geokok, you could chmod a-x /etc/init.d/gdm
[03:17] <Aberry> heh, you've lost me
[03:17] <quiet> Aberry, it's okay... you just don't understand how Linux uses RAM yet...  you are fine.
[03:17] <geokok> devilsadvocate:how do i choose that?
[03:18] <Aberry> the overall usage of my physical ram reads as 235mb, out of 256, nothing used of the swap
[03:18] <devilsadvocate> geokok, it should be one of the options in grub while you boot
[03:18] <devilsadvocate> geokok, that would only give you a root console though
[03:18] <quiet> Aberry, example:  You run firefox...  then close it...  it doesn't clear firefox from the RAM, it keeps it cahced so if you use it again.. it's already there... thus improving load time...  however; if that space is needed because you are using other apps, it will readily use that space without thinking.
[03:18] <geokok> devilsadvocate: no options there...says grub loading and then the ubuntu logo
[03:19] <Aberry> oh ok, well now I know hehe
[03:19] <Aberry> it still doesnt explain the problem Im having though :S
[03:19] <devilsadvocate> geokok, it might give you a few seconds to go into advanced boot options
[03:19] <woodefec> hi
[03:19] <quiet> Aberry, what is the problem?
[03:19] <ScarFreewill> woodefec here
[03:19] <woodefec> hi
[03:20] <geokok> devilsadvocate: ok...i ll try a few key combs to see how i go to advanced mode
[03:20] <ScarFreewill> can i like give root 40gb and swap 3gb and home the rest?
[03:20] <devilsadvocate> geokok, you wont have to guess the key combinations - it will tell you while booting.
[03:20] <devilsadvocate> just after it says frub loading
[03:20] <toodles> Hi Everyone! Does anyone know why suspend works perfectly on my laptop (Dell 640m) and it resumes perfectly after it too, but screenblank does not. It blanks the screen correctly, but won't display it again. Any ideas?
[03:20] <Janchi> deusjevoo: back again
[03:20] <Aberry> quiet, ive installed the exact same OS on two of exactly the same servers, both running as dns servers. they both fetch names just as quickly but the primary dns server takes up to five minutes to load a program in the gnome gui, yet does not seem to be processing or reading anything in this time.
[03:21] <devilsadvocate> grub*
[03:21] <woodefec> i want to install kubuntu, does the installator give an option to leave my old /home/foo_user untouched (to keep all the settings and data and make the old home dir my new one)
[03:21] <woodefec> >?
[03:21] <quiet> Aberry, strange, perhaps a corruption during install? also... why are you running gnome on a DNS server?
[03:21] <quiet> or X at all, for that matter.
[03:21] <mhenning8> Can ubuntu use the 3d desktop like mandriva?
[03:21] <Aberry> quiet, because Im a dunce and couldnt begin to setup NAMED without webmin :p
[03:21] <ovihc_> ScarFreewill: 3gb of swap is too much. the rule is twice your real memory.
[03:22] <ScarFreewill> ovihc_: ok...
[03:22] <woodefec> can I leave my old /home ??
[03:22] <darko3d> sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl libgl1-mesa xserver-xorg libglitz-glx1 beryl emerald-themes beryl-settings xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` <-- i ran this, but connection is bad and some files are failing to download everytime there's a timeout, is there a package i can download one time and run it offline
[03:22] <quiet> Aberry, webmin doesn't require X... it's web-based.. simply connect to it from another machine.  ;)
[03:22] <ScarFreewill> ovihc_: want to know what woodefec is asking too
[03:22] <ovihc_> SacrFreewill: how much memory do you have? 256? 512? 1gb?
[03:22] <ScarFreewill> ovihc_: 1gb
[03:22] <silvertip257> I'm trying to build wireless drivers for my card. I've got all the files formatted right, but do not know how to compile/build the driver
[03:22] <Aberry> I had this same problem using fedora actually, come to think of it, as I tried that to start, then pclinuxos, which ran fine but had problems with BIND, then ubuntu
[03:23] <Aberry> hehe yeah I know that much but there are a few other things I needed to set up at the same time, plus I have no Idea how i'd set up webmin in the console.
[03:23] <daidungsi> hi i'm newbie in ubuntu
[03:23] <ovihc_> woodefec: it is possible. i just can't recall the process, but i do know that it is possible. i've done it before.
[03:23] <daidungsi> i have a dislaychm file
[03:23] <hamdinp> hamdinp 123456
[03:24] <daidungsi> how can i make it install
[03:24] <hamdinp> hamdinp 123456
[03:24] <SpriteSODA> guys is someone here familiar with cvs-cedega?
[03:24] <ovihc_> ScarFreewill: since you have 1gb of memory, 1gb of swap is enough.
[03:24] <silvertip257> how do I build drivers/compile them into something useful ?
[03:24] <Janchi> SpriteSODA: Cedega yes
[03:24] <daidungsi> displaychm to view .chm file
[03:24] <ScarFreewill> ovihc_: ok
[03:25] <The_Machine> how do i make it so that folder sizes show up in nautilus?
[03:25] <Aberry> quiet, have any more ideas as to what it might be?
[03:25] <darkbishop> nope.. dont working either... damn... im sooo stupid at mounting ntfs file system... its said ntfs-3g cant be install
[03:25] <pinchartl> hi
[03:26] <Janchi> SpriteSODA: what do you need to know?
[03:26] <Aberry> darkbishop, ntfs-3g is a pain, try typing -nonempty on the end of the command and see if this is the problem
[03:26] <kinuxer> Failed to run /usr/bin/update-manager as user root:
[03:26] <kinuxer>  Child terminated with 1 statushow can I make it normal?
[03:26] <ActivE> I just overwrote my PATH variable with the command PATH=/usr/local/java :P. Now no commands work in the termial, how can i restore this vairable?
[03:26] <ovihc_> The_Machine:I'm not aware of a feature in nautilus that will give you the folder size. imagine that you visited the root folder, then it would search y our whole hard drive and that would take too much time.
[03:26] <Aberry> I spent about an hour trying to mount an ntfs partition before I figured it out :D
[03:27] <kinuxer> Failed to run /usr/bin/update-manager as user root:

[03:27] <The_Machine> that sucks ass.
[03:27] <darkbishop> Aberry: can u give me an example.. i dont get what u mean??
[03:27] <The_Machine> :/
[03:27] <Aberry> darkbishop, is ntfs-3g installed ok?
[03:28] <darkbishop> Aberry:nope.its said it cant be install..
[03:28] <erider> how do I get opengl working on my 64bit system?
[03:28] <quiet> Aberry, not really man... maybe something got corrupted during install??  does _any_ app take that long to load, or just certain ones?
[03:28] <Rarj> Hi. How do I add a Shutdown option to the quit button ?
[03:28] <Aberry> darkbishop, ah right, well that sucks, did you run it in root or sudo?
[03:28] <quiet> Rarj, are you using GDM?
[03:28] <kinuxer> Failed to run /usr/bin/update-manager as user root:
[03:28] <kinuxer>  Child terminated with 1 statushow can I make it normal?
[03:29] <Rarj> quiet, yes
[03:29] <Aberry> quiet, all of them take a while, except named and ubuntu itself, all startup code seems to run OK
[03:29] <darkbishop> Aberry: Depends: libc6 (>=2.4-1) but 2.3.6-0ubuntu20 is to be installed
[03:29] <quiet> Rarj, then it should be there.
[03:29] <darkbishop> Aberry: that what its said... run it in.. synaptic package manager...
[03:29] <quiet> Aberry, try to launch the gui app from a terminal and see if it gives any messages...
[03:29] <Rarj> quiet, It isnt, all I get is logoff, lock, switch user & hibernate
[03:29] <quiet> if not... you could also try an strace... but that's beyond my scope.
[03:29] <Aberry> darkbishop, what I meant was when you tried installing the package was it installed via the console with "sudo" preceding it
[03:30] <Aberry> quiet, what's an strace?
[03:30] <thompa> im having frustrating problems setting up laserjet 1018
[03:30] <kinuxer> Failed to run /usr/bin/update-manager as user root:

[03:30] <[Blackheart] > hello, I tried installing the libstdc++ libraries using apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 but it complains about missing dependencies, is there a way to make apt install the dependencies aswell?
[03:30] <Khamael> where can I find a good howto for setting up quotas?
[03:30] <quiet> it will trace all threads executed and allow you to see where it hangs up.. but it's output is quite cryptic so you'd probably just have to pastebin it and ask someone to look.
[03:30] <darkbishop> Aberry:let me try again
[03:30] <Aberry> go to a console, type sudo synaptic then try and install it, see if it helps
[03:31] <almir> i have a problem booting from my ubuntu 6.10 CD, after i chose start or install ubuntu it wait a little to tell me that it can't start the X server, i've checked for defects and the CD have worked before 100%, help?
[03:31] <Aberry> quiet, sounds fuuun :p, thanks alot for your help anyway. I think it might actually be a hardware problem, since it's happened with two distros
[03:31] <kinuxer> ok,i will try
[03:32] <quiet> Aberry, possible... hard drive may be dying.
[03:32] <Aberry> quiet, Ill stick in some new ram and see how it goes, lift the old stuff out
[03:32] <Daviey> Hi, can somebody guide me how to burn an ISO from the console?
[03:32] <Aberry> quiet, I doubt it as it's scsi, not too old and it boots ubuntu fairly quickly
[03:32] <[Blackheart] > anyone? im doing this from a console
=== OPTi2 is now known as OPTiCO
[03:32] <Aberry> I think it might have a problem unloading ram
[03:33] <ovihc_> almir: are you using any type of special hardware. what is your monitor type? your video card? and when it says it can't load X, is that before you get the ubuntu desktop?
[03:33] <thompa> anyone know how i can clean up ubuntu printer files and drivers and start over
[03:33] <kinuxer> sudo: must be setuid root
[03:33] <kinuxer> I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:33] <quiet> Aberry, is this edgy or dapper?
[03:33] <darko3d> sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl libgl1-mesa xserver-xorg libglitz-glx1 beryl emerald-themes beryl-settings xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` <-- i ran this, but connection is bad and some files are failing to download everytime there's a timeout, is there a package i can download one time and run it offline, i have dapper with an ati card, if that helps?
[03:34] <Aberry> quiet, I cant remember, I think edgy, I know it's the newer distro with the shorter support length
[03:34] <kinuxer> sudo: must be setuid root
[03:34] <kinuxer> kinuxer I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:34] <allz> !nvidia
[03:34] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:34] <quiet> edgy...  i would suggest dapper for server use... but if you said you had a similar problem with another distro, i don't know.
[03:34] <almir> ovihc_: i don't think im using any special stuff, im running XP on the very computer now
[03:35] <Aberry> quiet, ok thanks alot for your help anyhow, i'll have a fiddle see what it comes up with
[03:35] <Arcad3> someone can help me with something?
[03:35] <almir> ovihc_: grafic card, ATI radeon X600 256MB
[03:35] <darko3d> please someone, help me
[03:35] <quiet> Aberry, good luck.
[03:35] <Janchi> Arcad3: tell us
[03:35] <Aberry> cheers
[03:35] <Arcad3> cgi...
[03:35] <Janchi> darko3d: tell us
[03:36] <almir> ovihc_: and yes before ubuntu desktop
[03:36] <darko3d> sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl libgl1-mesa xserver-xorg libglitz-glx1 beryl emerald-themes beryl-settings xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` <-- i ran this, but connection is bad and some files are failing to download everytime there's a timeout, is there a package i can download one time and run it offline, i have dapper with an ati card, if that helps?

[03:36] <kinuxer> kinuxer kinuxer I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:36] <livingdaylight> LInux is not ready for my desktop - yuck
[03:36] <jfrench> What is the command for xorg config, i always forget
[03:36] <jfrench> ??
[03:36] <livingdaylight> a simple matter of printing a photo is just a nightmare
[03:36] <Janchi> livingdaylight: why do you say that
[03:36] <ovihc_> when it starts booting, and before you press ENTER to start the live cd, try to use the vesa graphics driver instead.
[03:37] <almir> ovihc_: the computer is from dell, maybe they don't like linux what do i know :S
[03:37] <Arcad3> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:37] <livingdaylight> Janchi, you try and print as much as a photo and get it the right size etc?
[03:37] <jfrench> Arcad3:thank you so much
[03:37] <Janchi> livingdaylight: sure. In GIMP
[03:37] <Arcad3> np
[03:37] <almir> ovihc_ok
[03:38] <Discerer> hmm the ftp server guide on ubuntuguide.org doesn't say how to add users to the ftp server. anyone know?
[03:38] <Janchi> livingdaylight: just as easy (or complicated) as Fireworks
[03:38] <livingdaylight> Janchi, no way, its friggin nightmare and takes ages
[03:38] <allz> is ubuntu better then kubuntu?
[03:39] <allz> just ask yes or no please
[03:39] <livingdaylight> i just want to print  a photo!
[03:39] <Arcad3> allz Kubuntu is using KDE
[03:39] <livingdaylight> Janchi, have to waste tons of paper and ink
[03:39] <Janchi> livingdaylight: what did you try so far?
[03:39] <ovihc_> alimr: the issue is not that it's a dell computer. the problem is your card. i found several topics on the internet about using your model of the card in linux.
[03:39] <kinuxer> no,i like ubuntu with gnome,it looks simple
[03:39] <allz> what does that mean arcad3
[03:39] <livingdaylight> Janchi, gimp
[03:39] <murchadh> I see some printing probs. Anyone have any joy with the HP Photosmart range of printers! Can't get M$ off this machine until I can get some properly sized photo output from my 7960. livingdaylight I feel your pain!
[03:39] <allz> and ubuntu using kdm
[03:39] <allz> what is the difrence?
[03:39] <Janchi> livingdaylight: even in Windows it is not simply click and print. You are using the settings more automatically there
[03:40] <Arcad3> i dont know
[03:40] <livingdaylight> Janchi, and then tried just opening the photo from nautilus and clicking print
[03:40] <Arcad3> its similar to Gnome
[03:40] <ovihc_> almir: it has to do with the ati driver. if you use either the vesa or the ati driver, then everything should work, but you might be missing precious hardware accelleration.
[03:40] <ovihc_> almir: i meant to say, "either the vesa or radeon driver"
[03:40] <Janchi> livingdaylight: that is similar to trying that from the Explorer under Windows. If you do that it will print the photo without any regard for settings
[03:40] <Arcad3> can someone help me with cgi and perl scripts?
[03:41] <Arcad3> i installed php5-cgi
[03:41] <darkbishop> Aberry: hey its work.. thx man
[03:41] <almir> ovihc_: okey
[03:41] <livingdaylight> Janchi, why do i have to open gimp anyways, just to print a photo, and then although i cropped it to the size i want i comes out huge or not at all
[03:41] <Arcad3> i dont know how to configure httpd.conf to read cgi and perl
[03:41] <livingdaylight> i hate LInux right now
[03:41] <livingdaylight> its a piece of hobby crap
[03:41] <Janchi> livingdaylight: it is not Linux that is the problem
[03:41] <almir> ovihc_: thx
[03:42] <kinuxer> sudo: must be setuid root
[03:42] <kinuxer> kinuxer kinuxer kinuxer I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:42] <Janchi> livingdaylight: it might be your ability to switch softwarepackages. There is a learning curve involved in the change
[03:42] <teledyn> how do i completely disable kernel automounting of /dev/hdc ?
[03:42] <kinuxer> anybody can help me?sudo: must be setuid root
[03:42] <kinuxer> kinuxer kinuxer kinuxer I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:42] <ovihc_> almir: welcome
[03:43] <livingdaylight> janchi dont give me all that mumbo jumbo linux rhetoric
[03:43] <darkbishop> teledyn: hmm edit /etf/fdisk
[03:43] <Janchi> livingdaylight: no mumbo jumbo, training experience
[03:43] <livingdaylight> Janchi, is that all linux people can say when people are frustrated by linux's incapacity to do simple things?
[03:43] <almir> ovihc_: u choose this at the options meny, right?
[03:43] <livingdaylight> I just want to print a 4x6 photo goddammn it!
[03:43] <Janchi> livingdaylight: no, but if you are not willing to learn the simple solution is to stick with Windows
[03:44] <teledyn> darkbishop: wtf is /etf/fdisk  ?
[03:44] <ovihc_> almir: in the boot menu.
[03:44] <darkbishop> teledyn: hmm edit /etc/fdisk
[03:44] <teledyn> darkbishop: what is that?  it doesn't exist
[03:44] <almir> ovihc_: ? before i even enter ubuntu?
[03:44] <ovihc_> yes
[03:45] <Janchi> livingdaylight: what did/do you use under windows to print photos?
[03:45] <murchadh> livingdaylight: I'm having problems which sound very similar to yours, and it is on my agenda for this evening. I have tried in krita and gimp, but like you the waste of ink made me give up. HP are sucking enough out of me with their dearer than gold inks!
[03:45] <darkbishop> teledyn, yes there is.. lemme check
[03:45] <livingdaylight> Janchi,  i haven't used windows for 4 years
[03:45] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, if you want to just print the image as it is, you don't need Gimp. If you want to edit the image (resize, etc.), then you need an image editor. Not necessarily Gimp, though
[03:45] <Jural> man fdisk
[03:45] <deusjevoo> Janchi, you gave a link from a friend of you to, can you paste again plz?
[03:45] <devilsadvocate> darkbishop, that is fstab
[03:45] <Janchi> deusjevoo: www.digiplace.nl
[03:46] <teledyn> Jural: was that addressed to anyone in particular?
[03:46] <we2by> what php script do you use as a blogger?
[03:46] <kinuxer> anybody can help me?sudo: must be setuid root
[03:46] <kinuxer> I type sudo synaptic,then show that!
[03:46] <teledyn> jeeezus
[03:46] <teledyn>   /etc/fdisk   right
[03:47] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, well, i used to gimp to resize my image because no i don't want to spend ink on an A4 size photo - no thank you very MUCH! having resized/cropped it i thought i could just print it like you say from an image viewer, but then it comes out A4 again. Does LInux realize that ink is expensive?
=== rickyfingers_ is now known as rickyfingers
[03:47] <darkbishop> yeah.. its suppost to be /etc/fstab
[03:47] <darkbishop> thx devilsadvocate
[03:47] <deusjevoo> yep, that's it
[03:47] <teledyn> darkbishop: no shit?  really?  thanks for your help
[03:47] <SoftIce> hi, how do you install the source for ubuntu?
[03:47] <Janchi> livingdaylight: why are you generalizing a photo problem to a complete OS?
[03:47] <SoftIce> some programs say I need the source
[03:47] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, there is probably a print preview somewhere...
[03:48] <Rarj> Can Ubuntu be booted from a flash drive ?
[03:48] <murchadh> kinuxer: I think your user (who you are logged in as) needs to be added to the sudoers group, which is admin or adm I think.
[03:48] <almir> ovihc_: that is not equel BIOS is it?
[03:48] <livingdaylight> murchadh, there is an ink cartel. It must be worth the price of gold i agree. It is total daylight-robbery. And to compound the problem we have to waste pages and pages figuring out how to get it to print the size and co-ordinates we want
[03:48] <ovihc_> almir: no
[03:48] <SoftIce> sorry I mean how do I install the kernel source for ubuntu?
[03:48] <teledyn> darkbishop: and what, exactly, do you propose to change in /etc/fdisk - excuse me - /etc/fstab ?
[03:49] <ovihc_> almir: your cd loads. then you get a screen before you boot ubuntu. in that screen, i think it should say something like "press enter to boot" i can load it on my computer but you'll have to wait for me to download the image.
[03:49] <livingdaylight> murchadh, would youbelieve me if i told i had to place my 4x6 paper in so many diferent wasy before it was in alignment with where the printer put the image, usually missing and printing off it and wasting so much and ink and paper this way
[03:49] <darkbishop> teledyn: cut tat out..... just delete anything tat saying /dev/hdc from end to end
[03:49] <livingdaylight> Janchi, get out  of denial
[03:49] <ovihc_> kinuxer: you have to issue a chmod +u path_to_sudo
[03:49] <almir> ovihc_: i think i have 2 choises: F2 for boot or F12 for setup
[03:50] <Janchi> livingdaylight: Can I ask why you are here? to get proper help or debunk Linux?
[03:50] <darkbishop> teledyn:dont forget to backup...
[03:50] <teledyn> darkbishop: you are a moron and shouldn't be offering people "advice" on irc, even if it makes you think you're smart
[03:50] <livingdaylight> Janchi, you know it is LInux and LInux and LInux. Everyone knows LInux sux when it comes to doing anything simple and practiacal. It is good only for installing one flavor and then the other and then another one but never doing anything practical, especially not printing
[03:50] <darkbishop> teledyn:but other people dont seem to be bother with ur question
[03:50] <livingdaylight> Janchi, you need to join Linux Anonymous
[03:50] <jaek> omg my computer froze and cleared out my /tmp when i restarted... i need a file that was in there... how can i undelete a file that was there?
[03:50] <rickyfingers> softice: use synaptic, do a serch for kernel source, scroll down to about the middle of the results, it's the linux-source package
[03:50] <Nlytn> hi - installed ubuntu this morning, but its being really laggy and slow... im getting a lot of "force quit" windows, and opening programs takes an age most of the time, im on a 3ghz p4 1.5gb so :\ - help please? :x
[03:50] <almir> ovihc_: and the F2 meny isn't really working as i should be and i don't see a lot of settings options there
[03:51] <Janchi> livingdaylight: I work under Linux daily, as well as with Windows and Mac OS X. I never had any problems with either of them. So.. .not everyone knows...
[03:51] <teledyn> darkbishop: maybe because they don't know the answer and aren't pretending to be experts?
[03:51] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, most people here don't have those problems. They might be willing to help you too, but if you're abusive...
[03:51] <jeroen__> can anyone help me with some iptables stuff?
[03:51] <SoftIce> rickyfingers: would linux-headers-server be sufficient?
[03:51] <darko3d> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingBeryl?highlight=%28beryl%29, how can i download the file to install them offline
[03:51] <iwkse> anybody known where is possible to edit schema gnome files?
[03:51] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, there is a printpreview but it doewsn't let you change the size or anything. So it prints what it prints and i would expect that to be the new size of the image i just cropped using gimp
[03:51] <teledyn> anyhow thanks i'll google it
[03:51] <ovihc_> almir: try F12 then.
[03:52] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, you obviously havn't got any expereince in this department i can tell
[03:52] <almir> ovihc_: but that is bios :(
[03:52] <murchadh> livingdaylight: I hear you! Must admit I've been using this printer for almost three years under Windoze, and bar the running cost, I've been happy with it. But it isn't as straightforward as people would have you believe to get photo quality printing in Linux. I know it is possible but I'm having problems with it. And HP are supposed to be one of the companies embracing the OS! Have been using Linux since 1993 (Slackware then, Kubuntu no)! We'll get
[03:52] <murchadh> there....
[03:52] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, keep resizing the image, see if print preview shows what you want, and don't print until it does.
[03:52] <kinuxer> could you tell me the more detail?thank you!
[03:52] <rickyfingers> SoftIce: well, those are the headers you need in order to compile the kernel
[03:53] <darko3d> sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl libgl1-mesa xserver-xorg libglitz-glx1 beryl emerald-themes beryl-settings xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` <-- i ran this, but connection is bad and some files are failing to download everytime there's a timeout, is there a package i can download one time and run it offline, i have dapper with an ati card, if that helps?
[03:53] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, printpreview in image viewer is a waste of time, see for yourself
[03:53] <darko3d> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingBeryl?highlight=%28beryl%29, how can i download the file to install them offline
[03:53] <KomiaPoika> where can i get a list of sysctl commands?
[03:53] <ovihc_> almir: i'm downloading the ubuntu install cd. you'll have to wait +-24 min. so that i can see it myself.
[03:54] <Janchi> livingdaylight: maybe it helps if you explain what you did try already? Or you can move to the GIMP IRC to get some specialist help on the package there.
[03:54] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, oh, try printing from Gimp, not from the image viewer
[03:54] <rickyfingers> KomiaPoika: are you talking about options you can give to sysctl ?
[03:54] <macluvjay> KomiaPoika, have you checked the man pages?
[03:54] <jaek> i never saw my /tmp get wiped on reboot, does that usually happen?
[03:55] <darko3d> how do you install mplayer
[03:55] <macluvjay> -p should instate any changes you've made to /etc/sysctl
[03:55] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, and actually, you don't even need to resize the image. While printing from Gimp, there is a scaling option, as well as one for positioning the image on the page
[03:55] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, dude, i appreciate your intention but you obviously have no experience in this department, and you're only suggesting things off the top of your head, thigns i've already tried - thx but no thx
[03:55] <almir> ovihc_: i think the problem is in my computer not in the CD
[03:55] <matason> I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu 6.06 on my IBM X31 using a USB HDD - I followed instructions on how to make the HDD bootable (instructions were for a USB stick - not sure if that makes any difference) anyway when I set the BIOS to boot from the USB HDD it cannot detect an OS... Any ideas?
[03:56] <teledyn> livingdaylight: that happens a lot here doesn't it?
[03:56] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, as you wish. I'm using Gimp right now, and I can see that it lets you print to any size.
[03:56] <ovihc_> almir: why do you think that? the solution is to switch from using the ati driver to the vesa or radeon driver, which is chosen in the boot menu. and i'm thinking that you are confusing your bios boot menu with the boot menu from the cd.
[03:57] <almir> ovihc_:okej
[03:57] <allz> ubuntu , please tell allz about nvidia
[03:57] <teledyn> livingdaylight: i disagree with you on printing though
[03:57] <allz> !nvidia
[03:57] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:57] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, your whole printing from imageviewer and it giving you printpreview was frankly baloney.. And i tried the reszing and printing out of gimp thing and no it wasn't successful
[03:57] <Janchi> livingdaylight: printer driver, maybe?
[03:58] <almir> ovihc_: but didn't we say before ubuntu was loaded, or did u only mean the desktop there
[03:58] <livingdaylight> teledyn, you have not had issues printing photographs to your size specification?
[03:58] <SillyZ> gmorning
[03:58] <Qshadowp> just installing ubuntu linux for the first time on my pc, never used any form of linux before...
[03:58] <almir> ovihc_: well dude, im running out of time
[03:58] <darko3d> how do you install mplayer
[03:58] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, you didn't listen. Print *from* GIMP. Not resize in Gimp and print from somewhere else.
[03:58] <Qshadowp> got to 20% (Scanning files)
[03:58] <Qshadowp> and its crashed
[03:58] <SillyZ> Im preparing to setup ubuntu/kubuntu on a dell e1705 laptop, anyone have any advice before I begin setup on this machine, things to watch out for, etc
[03:58] <savvas> Qshadowp: welcome to the free,community supported side then :)
[03:58] <Aberry> darko3d, sudo synaptic
[03:58] <teledyn> livingdaylight: i haven't tried printing images that much
[03:58] <ovihc_> almir: the desktop. good next time then..
[03:58] <Qshadowp> thanks savvas :)
[03:58] <almir> ovihc_: gotto go, but thx for the help
[03:59] <Nlytn> can someone tell me what application "dd" is? it was hogging over 50% cpu non stop :|
[03:59] <hastesaver> !mplayer > darko3d
[03:59] <Qshadowp> im likeing it all apart from this crash :(
[03:59] <Qshadowp> what should i do? :P
[03:59] <rickyfingers> darko3d: i always just get the url fromn google
[03:59] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, you did suggest the former too, and i tried the latter aswell, i think you;'re not listening
[03:59] <savvas> Qshadowp: what are you scanning?
[03:59] <Aberry> qshadow, is the cd a decent copydo you know
[03:59] <rickyfingers> darko3d: then i download source & codecs
[03:59] <livingdaylight> teledyn, well you try it :) its a friggin nightmare
[03:59] <Janchi> !dd
[03:59] <Qshadowp> Aberry downloaded it straight from the official ubuntu site and burned it to a brand new blank cd
[03:59] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, ok, try the latter again. Sorry about suggesting the former. :-)
[03:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:59] <Qshadowp> so i would assume so
[03:59] <Nlytn> ^^
[03:59] <rickyfingers> then just read through the README, and follow directions
[04:00] <Nlytn> !klogd
[04:00] <teledyn> livingdaylight: some apps have crappy printing, some are better
[04:00] <Qshadowp> i mean it booted up ok
=== visualstation is now known as Visual|BADDAY
[04:00] <ubotu> klogd: Kernel Logging Daemon. In component main, is important. Version 1.4.1-18ubuntu6 (edgy), package size 40 kB, installed size 140 kB
[04:00] <Aberry> doesnt mean it isnt dodgy :p I would try redownloading and burning slowly
[04:00] <hastesaver> darko3d, You should be able to install Mplayer the same way you install other apps. It's in Synaptic, or Add/Remove Applications
[04:00] <Qshadowp> booted up, hit the install button got to 20% of installing system (Scanning files) and just froze up
[04:00] <Qshadowp> so what should i do now just hard reboot my pc?
[04:00] <Aberry> qshadow unfortunately Ive had that problem myself on another distro, did not install properly because of a dodgy burn
[04:00] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, dude... i need a breather so much ink wastage...those cartridges are so expensive. If they were'nt i wouldn't mind wastoing a few trying to get it right, but i wish it was simpler, honestly
[04:00] <darko3d> i didn't find it in add/remove
[04:01] <ovihc_> Nlytn: dd copies data from one place to another. it could be syslogd.
[04:01] <savvas> Qshadowp: you're not reinstalling over an old version are you?
[04:01] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, when printing from Gimp, do you see a "scaling" option at the bottom? I do
[04:01] <Qshadowp> no
[04:01] <teledyn> livingdaylight: i remember once having really good results with a kde-based photo app where you could layout the page with photos of different sizes.  can't remember what its called.
[04:01] <Qshadowp> im installing onto a secondary hard drive
[04:01] <Qshadowp> i have windows xp on my primary drive
[04:01] <livingdaylight> teledyn, printing family images etc, is basic home-desktop usage now adays
[04:01] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, yes, i do too
=== Saribro- is now known as Saribro
[04:01] <Nlytn> ovihc_: ah, thankyou

[04:02] <teledyn> livingdaylight: tried digikam ?
[04:02] <Aberry> qshadow, did you chose the partition yourself or let linux do it?
[04:02] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, if you saw it, did you try it? 'cause it should work. There is a graphic of the page in the left-top corner, which shows how the image would look on the page.
[04:02] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, and how do i know i've got the size you want
[04:02] <Qshadowp> i let linux do it
[04:02] <Qshadowp> i took the option to let linux partition its own space
[04:02] <livingdaylight> teledyn, f-spot in ubuntu
[04:02] <Qshadowp> i had around 9gb free space on that drive
[04:02] <savvas> weird
[04:02] <livingdaylight> teledyn, digikam not sure
[04:02] <Qshadowp> the rest of it was just data
[04:02] <Nlytn> is there a way to restart X, to load my new gfx drivers without rebooting?
[04:02] <Aberry> qshadow, ack! hope that it hasnt eaten you windows partition and restart, then, and next time choose to install on the empty disk
[04:02] <LinuxHelp> I've just inserted a tv capture card. Linux seems to recognise it. How do I watch tv? Should I install tvtime? (Ubuntu 6.10)
=== ubuntu is now known as alitoch
[04:02] <murchadh> livingdaylight: You sound like me a couple of weeks ago! I gave up on it, but may get to it this evening. Next to try is messing with the dpi's and then further investigation of HP software/drivers. What is your printer btw?
[04:02] <alitoch> hi everybody
[04:03] <ovihc_> Nlytn: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
[04:03] <Qshadowp> Aberry it can't have because my windows partition is on the primary drive
[04:03] <teledyn> livingdaylight: give it a try.  its the premier kde based photo app that probably does most of what other consumer home photo apps do
[04:03] <hastesaver> Nlytn, you can kill X and restart it. Log out, then press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace. X should get "zapped" and the login screen should return again.
[04:03] <alitoch> could somebody be nice enough to help me in private ?
[04:03] <Qshadowp> i told it to install on the slave drive
[04:03] <Qshadowp> which is just data, that isn't really important anyways
[04:03] <hastesaver> !pm
[04:03] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[04:03] <Qshadowp> i guess i'll reboot into windows and format that drive then give it another go
[04:03] <Nlytn> hastesaver: thanks
[04:04] <The_Machine> how do i look at the partition information of a external hdd connected via usb?
[04:04] <livingdaylight> teledyn, will look into it, thx for the suggestion
[04:04] <teledyn> livingdaylight: gimp can be kind of cryptic to figure out unless you're a graphics wizard
[04:04] <murchadh> Nlytn: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or kdm if that's what you're using. That's the window manager - the X server is xserver-xorg.
[04:04] <Aberry> qshadow, no need to reformat, use the cd to do it but I advise reburning the cd slowly before you try, as if you chose the drive it shouldnt be freezing
[04:04] <teledyn> although gimp kicks ass for advanced editing
[04:04] <Nlytn> thanks
[04:05] <livingdaylight> murchadh, yea..it sure can be frustrating. I've not had problems with printer drivers. I have an Epson RX Stylus 425 and it picks it up no problem it s then coordinating and getting the applications to play ball that is challenging
[04:05] <ovihc_> The_Machine: sudo cfdisk /dev/_usb_drive
[04:05] <mamzers555> he, is there a plugin that translates words, if you only move the mouse-pointer over it? i have seen it in internet explorer, is there something for firefox?
[04:06] <mwe> Is a wifi card that is conforming to 802.11g limited to a max of 54Mbit/s or is it it a minimum?
[04:06] <Janchi> alitoch: I am waiting
[04:06] <Aberry> g+ is 125mbps, g is 54
[04:06] <The_Machine> thanks ovihc_
[04:06] <livingdaylight> teledyn, i just got Akkana Peck's Beginning Gimp from Apress publishers. I agree it is a mind-field. I want to just be able to open my photo album, say F-spot or whatever, select a photo and print it. Godammmm it!!! I'm getting all pissed off again all over just thingking about it!
[04:07] <The_Machine> is there a GUI partition manager available for ubuntu?
[04:07] <The_Machine> so i can format this external hdd?
[04:07] <Janchi> The_Machine: yes, gparted
[04:07] <ovihc_> The_Machine: gparted.
[04:07] <The_Machine> thanks Janchi and ovihc_!
[04:07] <Aberry> livingdaylight, try xara instead of, or along side, gimp, it works on vectors but its pretty powerful
[04:07] <teledyn> livingdaylight: gqview is the other photo viewer i like.  i don't know how great it prints but its a good general viewer
[04:07] <livingdaylight> teledyn, Why can't i just friggin open my photo album and select an image and select some standard size [4x6]  [5x7]  etc and click 'print' ??
[04:08] <murchadh> livingdaylight: Was hoping you were using a HP too. Yeah, it print's a lovely test page, where it should appear on the A4 sheet. Then from krita or gimp it print's my 6X4 photo as a poster. Whoo-hoo....
[04:08] <livingdaylight> Aberry, is it like Inkscape?
[04:08] <dennis_> .
[04:08] <mwe> but could an 802.11g card be faster than 54Mbit/s meaning that 54Mbit is guaruanteed but the rate may be higher?
[04:08] <Aberry> livingdaylight, I dont know inkscape sorry :S
[04:09] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, yes, there is probably a simple way. I really doubt you need something as powerful as Gimp. I would try to find out (I would need it when I buy a printer too), but the problem is, I'm not exactly using Ubuntu at the moment (I'm not at home) :-)
[04:09] <Aberry> livingdaylight, google it
[04:09] <Qshadowp> did a check on my disc and it said "Check finished, 5 checksums failed."
[04:09] <livingdaylight> murchadh, lol, ditto exaqctly, lol beautiful test page all the color spectrum -immaculate, and then 4x6 photo poster size , LOL
[04:09] <Qshadowp> i assume that means i have to re-write the disc?
[04:09] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, did you try printing with Gimp and the scaling thing?
[04:09] <Janchi> livingdaylight: something like this http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/02/09/0319227&tid=13&tid=49 , http://www.fogman.de/?GnomePhotoPrinter
[04:09] <Aberry> qshadow, yes thats why its not working, burn it at 2-4x speed, although long winded itll guarantee a nice cd :)
[04:10] <Qshadowp> Aberry ok :)
[04:10] <Aberry> qshadowp, good luck next time!
[04:10] <murchadh> livingdaylight: Wait 'til you hear my fix. Edit the photo to what you want, copy it to an SD card, stick that in the printer and print from the controls on the front of the printer. Technology! I'm not knocking Linux though. I love it, and this is the last thing I need to spend some time on - some time not some ink though. It's 45euro for 17ml here. Better mark-up than cocaine I'd say....
[04:10] <livingdaylight> Janchi, i just might need to be grateful to you there. That looks interesting. will look into that - thx
[04:11] <bluefox83> what codecs are needed by mplayer to run .avi files?
[04:11] <cmweb> Does any one know how to creaate a package and put it into the unuversal thing. I want to do this with zpanel whitch is a php script
[04:11] <Qshadowp> i assume theres no issues with burning the ubuntu iso with nero on windows xp?
[04:11] <livingdaylight> murchadh, lol :D
[04:11] <Janchi> livingdaylight: LOL. Don't worry. We all have been frustrated at times. Many times ;-)
[04:12] <teledyn> bluefox83: /msg ubotu mplayer
[04:12] <Aberry> qshadow, no, though the smallest and easiest for xp is "isorecorder" only 400kb and installs without restart, worked fine with me
[04:12] <Qshadowp> :)
[04:12] <bluefox83> Qshadowp, sometimes nero wants to add it's own little dos-like loader thingy to it and makes it pretty much impossible to boot..you might try burning it a few ways to make sure
[04:12] <Janchi> livingdaylight: I just googled "Photo printing Linux". There is more to find under that search
[04:12] <ish> So with Edgy, on an AMD64 system in 32 bit mode should I be using linux-image-generic?
[04:12] <Qshadowp> ok i'll try isorecorder then
[04:13] <ish> I don't see specific k7 kernels.
[04:13] <deusjevoo> Qshadowp
[04:13] <murchadh> livingdaylight: What distro are you using? Forgot I wasn't on #kubuntu at the moment.
[04:13] <Qshadowp> yea?
[04:13] <deusjevoo> what burner and media?
[04:13] <Aberry> qshadow, then to burn an iso you just have to right click on the cd and select record, like a built in windows sub-program
[04:13] <Qshadowp> internal dvd-rw inside a dell latitude d600
[04:13] <vpd> what can i do if 'df' shows wrong disk size?
[04:13] <vpd> disk=partition
[04:13] <deusjevoo> what speed?
[04:13] <Qshadowp> i tried 16x first
[04:14] <Qshadowp> but i'll download isorecorder and do it as slow as possible
[04:14] <livingdaylight> murchadh, LInux Mint as it happens, basicaly Ubuntu(EDGY) + MP3 ;)
[04:14] <deusjevoo> that's its max speed?
[04:14] <Qshadowp> yea :|
[04:14] <deusjevoo> ok, and the media, 48 or 52 ?
[04:14] <Qshadowp> no clue
[04:14] <deusjevoo> brand?
[04:15] <Qshadowp> doesn't say on the drive
[04:15] <Qshadowp> dell lol
[04:15] <Qshadowp> its just one of those built into a ugly laptop ones
[04:15] <Aberry> qshadow, if its a laptop do it on a table or something, keep it still, jiggling around the place doesnt help as is the case with laptops
[04:15] <deusjevoo> I mean the disk you're gonna burn, what speed is that?
[04:15] <cmweb> Has any one ever used Zpanel?
[04:15] <Qshadowp> deusjevoo no clue either lol
[04:15] <Qshadowp> just some blank ritecs i picked up at the shop
[04:15] <livingdaylight> Aberry, ok, i found it in repositories with Synaptic. just installed it so will see. Sounds similar to inkscape. but i still feel printing should be as simple as selecting your photo album selecting image/photo specifying size and clicking print. I think Janchi  may have found what i need, thx again for the input :)
[04:15] <deusjevoo> maybe your burner doesn't know the right strategy for it and needs a firmware update
[04:16] <deusjevoo> don't go slower then 4x
[04:16] <deusjevoo> as its probably a high speed media
[04:16] <Qshadowp> ok
[04:16] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, did you say you're not in UBuntu? Please don't tell me your using windows? please dont?
[04:16] <Aberry> livingdaylight, good luck with it though I dont know about the printing, Ive seem some pretty damned impressive stuff done with it though
[04:16] <deusjevoo> normally, 8x should be a better value, if your system is fast enough
[04:17] <Qshadowp> yea 8x was the slowest nero would allow me to go
[04:17] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, no, I'm using Debian. (That's why I could run Gimp, and all that... but this is quite an old distro)
[04:17] <deusjevoo> you could try an RW
[04:17] <The_Machine> hey Janchi - i have gparted up but it's showing a lock on my external HDD
[04:17] <The_Machine> even when i run it using root
[04:17] <Qshadowp> deusjevoo don't have any lol
[04:18] <Qshadowp> i don't burn discs that often
[04:18] <Qshadowp> i use a virtual drive in windows for any isos i get ;)

[04:18] <carlosqueso> The_Machine: is your HD mounted?
[04:18] <deusjevoo> using windows?
[04:18] <Aberry> I dont think it matters burning at slower speeds, particularly, as it simply defines the data more when it burns. I would just go as slow as possible, I did my burn with at 2x on 52x media and no md5 errors, all five distro cds Ive burnt
[04:19] <The_Machine> yes.
[04:19] <deusjevoo> get imgburn
[04:19] <Qshadowp> atm yea but im trying to switch to linux
[04:19] <The_Machine> carlosqueso: yes
[04:19] <livingdaylight> hastesaver, ok. What i'm getting attempting printing from Gimp is IP:Error - no default destination available
[04:19] <carlosqueso> The Machine: that's your problem...unmount it before you do anything to the partitions or you'll destroy your filesystem
[04:20] <deusjevoo> Qshadowp: http://www.imgburn.com/
[04:20] <Janchi> The_Machine: same suggestion umount your drive first. Something like umount /dev/sda1
[04:20] <Qshadowp> cool
[04:20] <inimesekene> i have here this problem that well i messed a bit with my partitions and i have ext3ifs installed in win and so when i booted to win my main partition (that i didn't mess with and has my ubuntu) wanted to be formatted, i didn't and tried booting ubuntu, no luck so i went into recovery mode and it said it didn't find the partition and it will create a temp shell to repair it and press ctrl+d to exit and continue with boot so i did and...
[04:20] <Qshadowp> i remember DVD Decrypter used to use that myself ;)
[04:21] <hastesaver> livingdaylight, sorry to hear that. Probably Gimp can't find your printer. Try the other things under Graphics, maybe.
[04:21] <deusjevoo> can use that to
[04:21] <inimesekene> it logged in as root and i checked ... everything is intact
[04:21] <Janchi> Gotta go. See you all

[04:25] <juliux> hi could it be that the edgy netboot.tar.gz is broken? if i try to unpack it i get an eof error
[04:25] <soundray> juliux: where did you download it?
[04:25] <juliux> soundray, from http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
[04:26] <lastnode> juliux, check the md5sum of it
[04:26] <juliux> lastnode, there is no md5sum;)
[04:26] <soundray> juliux: tests fine here. How are you trying to unpack?
[04:26] <lastnode> juliux, oh, then you're in a bit of a fix. it's most probably a bad download.
[04:26] <Bluhd> Is it just my computer or does the crossfire-server and crossfire-client packages not work properly under 6.10?
[04:26] <juliux> soundray, with tar xzf
[04:27] <soundray> juliux: I agree with lastnode. Download it again.
[04:27] <juliux> soundray, ok
[04:27] <soundray> juliux: I could give you the md5sum if you wanted to be sure?

[04:39] <carlosqueso> yeah....but I found out you can't stack them

[04:39] <carlosqueso> eniac_petrov: yes it is
[04:39] <eniac_petrov> carlosqueso, np :)

[04:42] <thompa> anyone know what ubuntu has for printing that other distros dont, does it use different drivers or something?
[04:42] <eniac_petrov> Guys, by the way: is there a driver for LCD monitors in the Ubuntu CD
[04:42] <thevenin> hrm
[04:42] <devilsadvocate> eniac_petrov, LCD should work out of the box
[04:42] <eniac_petrov> because I have error with X on 2 different computers with LCD monitors
[04:42] <thevenin> i would say search google for an alternate mirror of what you need
[04:42] <rickympl> murchadh, its at 640, but in the menu it states 1152
[04:42] <devilsadvocate> thompa, ubuntu has cupsd
[04:42] <eniac_petrov> i don't know why
[04:42] <devilsadvocate> what is the error?
[04:42] <thompa> i have to uninstall everything related to printing then start cups from scratch
[04:42] <thevenin> their is something wrong on their servers
[04:42] <soundray> thompa: you won't get any help with the type of question you're asking. Describe your problem, say what you've tried, say how it has failed.
[04:43] <ragamuffin> At boot, as soon as the Enterprise Volume Management System starts I get error messages. At first "Buffer I/O error on device dm-0. four lines or so of such message. Then I see "bad format on line 9 " (lines 15 and 19 also) of /etc/fstab
[04:43] <murchadh> rickympl: Don't know anything about cedega! But it sounds like you need to reconfigure the xserver. sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should reconfigure that!
[04:43] <eniac_petrov> the console says: there isn't X screens...
[04:43] <gpled> devilsadvocate: unless you have a dell gx150
[04:43] <rickympl> murchadh, wouldnt that just make another xorg.conf file?
[04:44] <carlosqueso> eniac_petrov: do you have a CRT that you can plug in?
[04:44] <devilsadvocate> gpled, ?
[04:44] <cmweb> Does na yone know of another boot manager for this and xp home? boot didnt load my windows restore and if its actuly gone then this is all i got left
[04:44] <thompa> soundray: my pages are cut off on bottom after printing, maybe 3 lines or more, also test pages, it works now, but i wish i knew what i did
[04:44] <devilsadvocate> wouldnt it be a problem with the graphics drivers and not the monitor?
[04:44] <thevenin> cmweb: lilo i do beleive could be wrong
[04:45] <cmweb> thevenin, im not using lilo im using grub
[04:45] <gpled> devilsadvocate: if you run it 1280x1024 it has lines all over it. in ubuntu 6.06
[04:45] <devilsadvocate> eniac_petrov, the problem is probably with your graphics chipset drivers
[04:45] <thevenin> what are you looking for then
[04:45] <ragnar_123> how do I convert a amr (cellphone sound file) to some other, readable file? (in ubuntu)
[04:45] <devilsadvocate> gpled, do you have the 915resolution package?
[04:45] <eniac_petrov> carlosqueso, no. This computer are in offices. Sux!
[04:45] <eniac_petrov> maybe
[04:45] <thevenin> you wanted another boot manager correct
[04:45] <Florob> Hi, everybody. Does someone know where gnome-window-decorator in feisty has gone? Or is there a different way to get window boarders now?
[04:45] <cmweb> thevenin, another one besides those two
[04:45] <soundray> cmweb: can you boot the machine while we chat?
[04:46] <thevenin> oh
[04:46] <devilsadvocate> Florob, Fiesty?
[04:46] <cmweb> I dont know how to do that
[04:46] <carlosqueso> eniac_petrov I'd run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose the vesa driver
[04:46] <gpled> devilsadvocate: if it is in by default i do.  i have not installed it manualy.
[04:46] <thompa> soundray: i onlt get the problem with laserjet on ubuntu, and uninstall cups and foo stuff, restart , go to cups local and reinstall printer, then it works, maybe its cupsd is different, i got no probs anty other distro
[04:46] <peter_t> I have just done an automatic update of my ubuntu 6.06 installation, and the root partition will not mount.
[04:46] <stojance> What is the program that can convert Ogg or Mp3 to AMR format?
[04:46] <cmweb> soundray, im not sure how to do that
[04:46] <devilsadvocate> gpled, i would try installing that. sudo apt-get install 915esolution
[04:46] <Florob> devilsadvocate: no feisty
[04:46] <devilsadvocate> and search on the forums for how-tos
[04:46] <carlosqueso> eniac_petrov it'll look like crap, but you can rule out your monitors being the problem
[04:46] <gpled> devilsadvocate: thanks, will try that
[04:47] <soundray> cmweb: you're not sure how to boot? Or you haven't got a second computer to continue chatting?
[04:47] <eniac_petrov> carlosqueso, 10x!
[04:47] <cmweb> oh, second computer to continue chatting i dont.
[04:47] <soundray> cmweb: is Windows on hda1 on your machine?

[04:48] <eniac_petrov> carlosqueso, is there "debian installer" in the CD
[04:48] <cmweb> Yes, but ive had to resize the windows partion for this install and so i can provide more room for hosting, I NEVER touched the nstd sector or what ever its called
[04:48] <mamzers555> he, is there a plugin that translates words, if you only move the mouse-pointer over it? i have seen it in internet explorer, is there something for firefox?
[04:49] <soundray> cmweb: just answer my question, are you sure that Windows is on hda1?
[04:49] <carlosqueso> eniac_petrov, if you mean is that on the livecd yes, if it's telling you it's not there, that's really weird
[04:49] <gpled> there is no bittent or something for updating?
[04:49] <isildur> ive just tried to upgrade to 6.10 with aptitude theres an error "Processing was halted because there were too many errors." anybody an idea how to solve it???
[04:49] <devilsadvocate> mamzers555, search on addons.firefox.com . there might be
[04:49] <cmweb> soundray, i am positive
[04:49] <mamzers555> devilsadvocate; i did, but no luck
[04:49] <athum> hi
[04:49] <soundray> Okay, when you start the computer, do you get to the grub menu?
[04:49] <murchadh> rickympl: If your xorg.conf file looks OK, that cedega must still be in control of something in the machine. Can you disable/remove it and reboot. Or is that a big job?
[04:49] <patrick_king> is it possible for ubuntu to connect to a windows domain
[04:50] <peter_t> various errors presented, such as "/dev/hdc3: Entry 'znew' in /home (1095585) has deleted/unused node 1095706"
[04:50] <athum> Do you know what is program to download all files from server? Like Teleport Pro on win
[04:50] <cmweb> soundray, yes but i get windows xp and no NT re3store
[04:50] <athum> Do you know what is program to download all files from server? Like Teleport Pro on win
[04:50] <devilsadvocate> patrick_king, yes it does so from the almost defalut install
[04:50] <gpled> patrick_king: Active Directory domain?
[04:50] <peter_t> I can mount hdc3 from the live cd with no problem
[04:50] <soundray> cmweb: so you *can* boot Win XP from hda1?
[04:51] <cmweb> soundray, yes i can BUT i can not restore the system from the other partion that emachins put on
[04:51] <FlyingSquirrel32> I can't install libsdl1.2-dev 'cause I can't install libartsc0-dev  because libartsc0 is version 1.5.5 and libartsc0-dev is version 1.5.4. Am I the only one in this situation?
[04:51] <soundray> cmweb: okay, what is that other partition?
[04:51] <devilsadvocate> cmweb, dont you get the windows boot menu when you select xp from grub?
[04:51] <cmweb> Im not sure its the verry first one
[04:52] <gpled> patrick_king: an old NT stile domain yes.  new 2003 domain installed securely - no
[04:52] <cmweb> devilsadvocate, xp does not have a boot menu
[04:52] <patrick_king> devilsadvocate: on a windows machein i would get the profile from the server but from ubuntu what would happen
[04:52] <soundray> cmweb: you said that Windows XP was on the very first one (hda1)
[04:52] <gpled> patrick_king: if you dummy down the new domain (bad idea) then yes
[04:52] <devilsadvocate> patrick_king, what kind of connection are you trying?
[04:53] <devilsadvocate> patrick_king, wondows shares? exchange?
[04:53] <cmweb> {||||RESTORE|||||}{|||||XP resized to 10gb||||||}{||||||||||||LINUX|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\)
[04:53] <cmweb> ^thats the diagram
[04:53] <soundray> cmweb: what is the device name of the restore partition?
[04:53] <cmweb> nts something
[04:54] <gpled> patrick_king: profiling is going to be a mess, because windows machine have diffrent file layout
[04:54] <cmweb> soundray, its like the tv thing
[04:54] <patrick_king> devilsadvocate: yeh its  a windows 2000 server, and i get my roaming profiles from it and i get all my files from it aswell
[04:54] <cmweb> soundray, the tv video
[04:54] <gpled> patrick_king: you would have to have the AD admin build you a special profile, which would be a lot of work
[04:54] <soundray> cmweb: I give up
[04:54] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: sorry, I just got here, did you join your ubuntu machine to a windows domain?
[04:55] <patrick_king> gpled: how would he do that
[04:55] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: he wants profiles
[04:55] <gpled> joining can be done.
[04:55] <cmweb> Soundray, its all on one diskdrive except for the ubuntu install which is on a 5gb drive
[04:55] <gpled> patrick_king: can i ask why you want to join?
[04:55] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: all you need to do is map your /home to the share on the windows server, not hard
[04:55] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32: i havent yet im going to tomorrow, its my college domain. they said if i can find out if it works they will do it
[04:55] <cmweb> suondray, the device on the restore i have no clue except for the type of partion
[04:56] <KHatfull> Greetings
[04:56] <prakka> greetings
[04:56] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: of course, the profile, wouldn't be the same as the windows profile, but your linux profile would roam with you and be stored in the same place where the windows one is
[04:56] <KHatfull> I'm a refugee from #ubuntuforums...nothing happening over there ;-)
[04:57] <carlosqueso> KHatfull: welcome to the busy one

[04:58] <peter_t> I wonder if anyone can advise me of the best way to get some advice fairly quickly

[04:59] <carlosqueso> allt: sorry about giving you bot stuff, but I'm just no good at pasting into putty
[04:59] <gpled> patrick_king: i woul break this up in parts
[04:59] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: access your files is easy, access the internet depends on how you're blocked in the first place.
[04:59] <mooey> peter_t, the forums are usually pretty quick
[04:59] <syntaxx> anyone know why my tvtime sound is blurred? sounds like no signal
[04:59] <peter_t> mooey: maybe that's my best bet, thanks

[05:00] <KHatfull> peter_t: ruh roh...
[05:00] <mooey> peter_t, then i guess 930 people in one channel is not a great place to start :D
[05:00] <prakka> lol ^^
[05:00] <peter_t> ya think?
[05:00] <KHatfull> mooey: LOL
[05:00] <gpled> patrick_king: if you ever realy want to join a windows AD domain, you have to use something called PAM, which gets messy fast
[05:00] <peter_t> Anyhoo, I'll head over to the forum I gues
[05:00] <peter_t> thanks guys
[05:00] <gpled> patrick_king: but i think you can get what you want just by talking to the network
[05:00] <KHatfull> peter_t: not to dis #ubuntu at all but try over at #ubuntuforums
[05:00] <mooey> peter_t, good luck with your problem

[05:01] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: I would LOVE to learn to do that! I've tried a couple times
[05:01] <mikl> everybody knows that ;)
[05:01] <KHatfull> peter_t: little slower there...although a lot slower at the moment
[05:01] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: great, I've done that here. hold on one sec.
[05:01] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: i had it working.  stopped at the profiling.  it is not worth the effort.  was hoping novel was going to fix this
[05:02] <FlyingSquirrel32> I'm really after the authentication. Any good tutorials>?
[05:02] <eniac_petrov> carlosqueso, :)

[05:02] <syntaxx> hi im having problems running tvtime in ubuntu.. the sound is blurred only buzzzzzzz anyone know how to fix this?
[05:03] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: i think i have a doc on how i did this for postfix, if your intrested
[05:03] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: first you need to figure out where the h: is mapped to it would look like \\fileserver\profiles
[05:04] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: no, I'm thinking like being able to log into a ubuntu machine using my domain username/password

[05:05] <matason_> Does that have a chance of working?
[05:05] <bartek__> hello. i m from poland and i m not very good at english but i ve problem

[05:05] <confusco> matason, maybe
[05:05] <alitoch> hi
[05:05] <confusco> you could try at leasnt
[05:05] <confusco> least
[05:06] <alitoch> could somebody help ?
[05:06] <alitoch> i have a problem with my mbr
[05:06] <patrick_king> flysquirrel32: yep i can get that name no problem
[05:06] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: pam can do that. just duck the profile stuff
[05:06] <boggle> matason_: with fedora I copied the install cd on the harddisk (dd) and it worked for the installation
[05:06] <matason_> confusco: OK thanks
[05:06] <boggle> matason_: I haven't tried it, but I'd give it a try
[05:06] <matason_> Yeh I tried making a boot HDD also
[05:06] <bartek__> look for this and help me http://forum.ubuntu.pl/viewtopic.php?t=17757
[05:07] <boggle> bartek__: what's the problem?
[05:07] <matason_> But it didn't recognise there was an OS on it
[05:07] <bartek__> it is  in polish language but look for commands
[05:07] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: yeah, but doing it is another story. still, your directions may be helpful
[05:07] <boggle> bartek__: do you have installed the nvidia drivers at all?
=== syntaxx_ is now known as syntaxx
[05:07] <bartek__> yes
[05:07] <bartek__> kernel, glx
[05:08] <boggle> bartek__: are they the right version? uname -r tells you the current running kernel
[05:08] <patrick_king> flysquirrel32: yep i can get that name no problem but what do i do when i got it
[05:08] <confusco> matason
[05:08] <confusco> matason_, why not a network install?
[05:08] <bartek__> the are from repos and what i must do with uname -r ? write in on terminal same
[05:08] <bartek__> ?
[05:09] <bartek__> only, with anything?
[05:09] <matason_> confusco: I can't seem to work out how to boot from the network
[05:09] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: if you type "net use" in command prompt when you're logged in on the windows machine it will tell you.
[05:09] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: this will just tell you how to talk ldap: http://postfix.wiki.xs4all.nl/index.php?title=Relay_recipient_maps_using_LDAP_against_Active_Directory

[05:10] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: might not make sense if your not into postfix
[05:10] <matason_> It's an IBM X31 - I have ADSL
[05:10] <boggle> bartek__: ok, what version are the drivers you installed for?
=== matason_ is now known as matason
[05:10] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: then follow these directions: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_mount_network_folders_on_boot-up.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read.2Fwrite
[05:10] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: there are docs on google for this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=linux+login+active+directory&btnG=Google+Search
[05:10] <patrick_king> first you need to figure out where the h: is mapped to it would look like \\fileserver\profiles
[05:11] <ActivE> how can i tell firefox to use the mplayer video plugin instead of totem?
[05:11] <bartek__> non-legacy first and legacy
[05:11] <unimatrix9> install mplayer plugin
[05:11] <bartek__> legacy i installed second when i removed non-legacy
[05:12] <ActivE> unimatrix9 i have done this.
[05:12] <bartek__> when i have with non legacy problem
[05:12] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: my goal is to some day set up a server that can do all that your average windows network does DNS, DHCP, mail, kerberos, Directory, file sharing
[05:12] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: of course mail ought to be on a seperate server, but you know what i mean
[05:12] <enkidu> how to install a quickcam communicate stx ?
[05:13] <boggle> ActivE: it's in the firefox preferences, downloads, download actions
[05:13] <boggle> bartek__: you can see the version of the nvidia drivers in the synaptic packet manager
[05:13] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: sad part is this all can be done now.  it is just hard to play with microsoft because the extended most of these.  kerberos is a great example
[05:13] <Stx> enkidu: are you asking me?
[05:13] <unimatrix9> sudo apt-get remove totem-gstreamer-firefox-plugin
[05:14] <enkidu> Stx: not especially
[05:14] <bashir> hey
[05:14] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: then follow these directions http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_mount_network_folders_on_boot-up.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read.2Fwrite
[05:14] <enkidu> Stx: it's in the ref of the webcam :)

[05:14] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: yeah.
[05:14] <Stx> enkidu: ah (: just noticed my nick was highlighted ;o)
[05:14] <bartek__> boggle__ i have not nvidiadrivers now biecause i removed them. I should install them?
[05:14] <bashir> for some reason whenever i try to start beryl if freezes
[05:15] <bashir> and i have to restart x
[05:15] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: I had kerberos working with NIS once. but I really want postfix and LDAP with the centralized authentication.
[05:15] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: it would be cool to make a gui for doing ssh/scp with keys from kerberos.
[05:16] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32: is that all i have to do
[05:16] <boggle> bartek__: when you want to use the nvidia drivers you have to install them. Otherwise the nvidia-setup script is not very useful
[05:16] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: kerberos is a real cool idea
[05:16] <bashir> do you have to install any apps before you try to install beryl, like compiz or something
=== Misnix2 is now known as Misnix
[05:17] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: I was thinking it would be awsome to make a server install option in ubuntu server with something like this.

[05:17] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: i am not realy sold on ldap.  think someone could make an sql db that is as fast as ldap.  it is hard for me to think in ldap
[05:18] <syntaxx> anyone who can help me? i wonder why im having a bad sound in tvtime and pinnacle pctv pro.. in debian im not having such thing
[05:18] <ActivE> Is it normal for the removal of the totem mozilla plugin to remove ubuntu-desktop?
[05:18] <unimatrix9> no
[05:18] <[ubu-e] -HaXeR> hello
[05:18] <FlyingSquirrel32> that way anyone can have an ubuntu server that could really replace a windows AD Domain Controller!
[05:18] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled:^
[05:18] <[ubu-e] -HaXeR> would like to start of that i need help with one little thing
[05:18] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: linux is great for one off machines, but if you had to manage 100's it gets to hard with out some kind of central authentication.  like you are talking about.  wish more effert was put to it.
[05:19] <carlosqueso> ActivE: yeah....anything that's apart of the default ubuntu installation takes that package off.  As long as you're using apt-get instead of aptitude, you won't have any problems
[05:19] <confusco> what's the keys to press to switch between workspaces?
[05:20] <ActivE> ok thx :)

[05:20] <wilcox> i've searched on google.com quite a bit, without results
[05:21] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: or "mounted" in linux
[05:21] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: have you seen this: http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/ParallelKnoppixTutorial.html
[05:22] <bartek__> boggle so what you think what i should do?
[05:22] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: the way the other computers joins the cluster sounds cool.  have not tried this yet, but have the cd's ready to go.
[05:22] <patrick_king> im not able to do that till tomorrow
[05:23] <patrick_king> as im at home now
[05:23] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: What happens when you browse to the internet in firefox?

[05:23] <unimatrix9> :)
[05:23] <rickyfingers> i have some .wmv files that mplayer can play back, but the screen size is fixed, does anyone know what command line options I could pass to mplayer to play back in full screen size?
[05:23] <confusco> carlosqueso, for some reason +workspace number doesn't work
[05:23] <confusco> but arrows do
[05:24] <unimatrix9> press f
[05:24] <rickyfingers> (when I hit 'f' for full screen, it just puts a huge black border around the video
[05:24] <carlosqueso> confusco...sorry, I may be wrong on the number, I'm at work, using windows
[05:24] <gpled> rickyfingers: just wondering, have you tried this in vlc?
[05:24] <carlosqueso> (and use xfce anyway)
[05:24] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: We have a bunch of old machines and my boss is a fellow geek and we were thinking of setting one up, but we can't think of anything to do with it!
[05:25] <rickyfingers> gpled: no I've never used vlc. I'll try that one. thanks for the hint.
[05:25] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: lol. you guys sound just like me :)
[05:25] <confusco> what's the keys to press to switch between workspaces?
[05:25] <Vuen> hey guys, i'm interested in installing a playstation emulator. epsxe seems to be the popular one, but ubuntu doesn't have it in its repositories; instead it has pscx. are these the same thing? should i go find a deb for epsxe?
[05:25] <gpled> rickyfingers: let me know if it works.  i play mac stuff in vlc.
[05:26] <rickyfingers> gpled: are there any special codecs/extra packages you reccomend installing along with vlc?
[05:26] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: next your going to tell me you watch nerdtv and wonding when the next episode is going to be out :)
[05:26] <sod75> anyone know how to see a changelog of packages (updates), eg what bugs are solved, security holes, etc ?
[05:27] <FlyingSquirrel32> gpled: never heard of it, but I'll check it out, sounds good!
[05:27] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: the reason I ask is that when I go to the internet from my ubuntu machine here at work, it just asks me for my username and pw and I put it in.
[05:27] <gpled> rickyfingers: i just search for vlc in snaptic (spelling) and select the ubuntu default one.  it grabs everything.  i even us vlc on windows
[05:28] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/
[05:28] <sod75> I second vlc on win
[05:29] <gpled> FlyingSquirrel32: bill joy's interview was good, if memory servse me.
[05:29] <FlyingSquirrel32> amen to vlc, that's our first answer when people need to see videos on windows.
[05:29] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32: what time is it where you are

[05:33] <ricola> can anyone help?
[05:34] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32:that would be great thanks
[05:34] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: I'm in NY, NY

[05:34] <ricola> gpled: uh?
[05:34] <gpled> ricola: TI1225
[05:35] <levander> What's the web site of that "Official Ubuntu Guide" book?  Isn't the text of it online?
[05:35] <ricola> gpled: no, not the calculator :)
[05:35] <Alakazamz0r> whats up w/the mirrors, why are they so slow.
[05:35] <patrick_king> flyinfsquirrel32: england
[05:35] <ricola> gpled: its actually labeled as TI PCI1225
[05:35] <voidmage> http://ubuntuguide.org?
[05:35] <gpled> ricola: what is it?  sounds like my old TI994A :)
[05:35] <ricola> gpled: just a PCMCIA controler in an old Dell laptop
[05:36] <PaulCarpenter> does anyone know if ubuntu gets along with those fingerprint readers that ibm laptops have?
[05:36] <syntaxx> im having problem in tvtime pctv pro sound anyone know how to fix this? please?
[05:36] <Alakazamz0r> no one has an answer?
[05:36] <Alakazamz0r> whats up w/the mirrors, why are they so slow.
[05:36] <gpled> ricola: hmmm, i have had lots of luck with pcmcia controlers.  it is streange it is not working out of box for you.
[05:37] <PaulCarpenter> Alakazamz0r: be patient, get yourself a cup of tea.
[05:37] <keithhhhh> does anyone know how to assign an IP to a hard drive I want to share on my network?
[05:37] <keithhhhh> (does this make sense??)
[05:37] <ricola> gpled: its a fairly old laptop
[05:37] <Alakazamz0r> PaulCarpenter im being patient, i dont need to download anything. Im just curious.
[05:37] <Agrajag> keithhhhh: not even a little.
[05:37] <keithhhhh> Agrajag: darn
[05:37] <gpled> ricola: one thing you could try is boot from knoppix cd, and see if it works.  if it does, then look to see what mods they are loading
[05:38] <Agrajag> Hard drives don't get IP addresses, network interfaces do.
[05:38] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh, maybe you are talking about running nfs?
[05:38] <syntaxx> im having problem in tvtime pctv pro sound anyone know how to fix this? please?
[05:38] <gpled> ricola: fells like a mod not loading issue
[05:38] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: well I bought a NAS drive
[05:38] <ricola> gpled: its not a module problem, and i cant boot anything anyways, the machine has no cd ;)
[05:38] <PaulCarpenter> Alakazamz0r, well I'm currently downloading an ISO from the Kent mirror at 241KB/sec atm, doesn't seem too slow to me.
[05:38] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh, ah things are beginning to make more sense.
[05:38] <gpled> Agrajag: cant wait for ipv6 :)
[05:38] <Agrajag> gpled: oh that's going to confuse the hell out of me for a while
[05:38] <ricola> gpled: no, everythings loaded, it looks like a sysfs/udev issue of some sort
[05:39] <PaulCarpenter> so, anyone any idea about fingerprint readers?
[05:39] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: Im told I need to share a folder
[05:39] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: and use the same IP Address Range and Subnet Mask
[05:39] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: what operating system does the nas drive run? It must have a way that it can be configured.
[05:39] <gpled> ricola: what version of ubuntu are you using?
[05:39] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: here's the directions: type about:config in the address bar, then the parameter "network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" must include http://<proxy-server-ip> where <proxy-server-ip> is the IP address of the proxy server.
[05:39] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: ah that might be what I dont understand
[05:40] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: there is 2 major types right?
[05:40] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: what is the make and model of the drive you got?
[05:40] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: that's for firefox
[05:40] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: that's all I know :)
[05:40] <patrick_king> ok will do that once its sorted
[05:40] <patrick_king> cheers for ya help
[05:40] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: I hate to say it but its more complicated than that its a korean case with tv ports
[05:40] <ricola> gpled: well, i'm actually not using ubuntu, but Debian etch - still, Ubuntu uses newer kernels, do did switch to pcmciautils instead of deprecated pcmcia-cs, which is why i came ask here too
[05:41] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: the tv ports work, just cant get it recognized by the network
[05:41] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: It feels good to be helping instead of needing help 8-)
[05:41] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: do you mean it has old style bnc connectors? Like it uses coax?
[05:41] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: does it also have regular rj-45 ethernet ports?
[05:41] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: it has rj45
[05:41] <gpled> ricola: they "linux people" have been doing a lot of work in the udev space.  if you can get the news stuff on there, it might start working
[05:42] <confusco> what's the keys to press to switch between workspaces?
[05:42] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: (and rca and HD ports to watch my divx and xvid  :)  )
[05:43] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: this is a quote of what I must do...."After connecting LAN cable, you have to set network configurations of Computer and MG-35.
[05:43] <keithhhhh> You need to share a folder on Windows computer and use same IP Address range and same Subnet Mask  between
[05:43] <keithhhhh> Windows computer and MG-35."
[05:43] <saimu0> hello....  does anyone know anything about SCIM?
[05:43] <syntaxx> im having problem in tvtime pctv pro sound anyone know how to fix this? please?
[05:44] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: hmmm but they left out how to set the IP on their own box.  That's some of the best documentation I ever heard of.
[05:44] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: OK google is our friend.
[05:44] <gpled> ricola: here is an idea what they have been doing to udev: http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3635686
[05:44] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: ya or Im missing something
[05:44] <confusco> what's the keys to press to switch between workspaces?
[05:45] <saimu0> confusco can you do that with Keys?
[05:45] <saimu0> im using a laptop and that would be amazing if you could.
[05:45] <confusco> yes
[05:45] <keithhhhh> I see the folder Im trying to access I just cant access the files  :(
[05:45] <fyrestrtr> confusco: ctrl+alt+arrow keys
[05:45] <sunnyhours4130> I'm new to ubuntu, is there a live cd that comes with xgl or similar that I can demo?
[05:45] <saimu0> WOOOOW!
[05:45] <saimu0> it really workd
[05:45] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: the other thing is that you can make something that looks like a windows shared folder with SMBA
[05:45] <fyrestrtr> sunnyhours4130: not of ubuntu, but gentoo has a live cd with xgl. Its called 'Kororaa'.
[05:46] <confusco> fyrestrtr, how come I only have 2 workspaces?
[05:46] <confusco> when using the arrows
[05:46] <fyrestrtr> confusco: I don't know?
[05:46] <saimu0> Anyone know anything about SCIM yet?
[05:46] <sunnyhours4130> fyrestrtr: Yeah, i played with kororaa. i'd like to stay away from gentoo   =)
[05:46] <fyrestrtr> confusco: how man do you want?
[05:46] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: hmmm thanks for your advice  ;)
[05:46] <saimu0> well i can access all 4 confusco
[05:46] <fyrestrtr> sunnyhours4130: well, xgl is xgl. It works the same way in any distro.
[05:46] <confusco> maybe I changed a setting
[05:46] <saimu0> maybe
[05:46] <sunnyhours4130> yeah
[05:46] <confusco> probably
[05:47] <saimu0> does anyone know anything about SCIM   if you do message me/
[05:47] <syntaxx> im having problem in tvtime sound im using pinnacle pctv pro.. images are fine is just that no sound/buzzz sound in debian theres no problem anyone here who can help me?
[05:47] <confusco> now, what's an easy way to benchmark my videocard performance? for some reason, both a native game and game on WINE are performing much slower than on Win
[05:47] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: I'm googling now.  For some reason, I am drawn to this issue, like a moth to an open flame.
[05:47] <fyrestrtr> syntaxx: might try your luck in #debian
[05:47] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: hehee
[05:47] <rkd> confusco: in a pinch, glxgears
[05:47] <fyrestrtr> confusco: glxgears
[05:48] <confusco> well somebody said it's not very useful
[05:48] <fyrestrtr> confusco: first thing you need to do, is make sure direct rendering is working.
[05:48] <confusco> yes I think it is
[05:48] <syntaxx> fyrestrtr: i just migrate to ubuntu that is why im asking here if anyone who can help me
[05:48] <confusco> how do I check
[05:48] <fyrestrtr> confusco: glxinfo | grep direct
[05:48] <rkd> confusco: although all that really tells you is if you have 3D rendering or not
[05:48] <syntaxx> fyrestrtr: and in debian tvtime and my capture card works fine
[05:48] <saimu0> ILOVE ubuntu! ~~  so much i could cry.
[05:48] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: saw something that said you can use the remote to configure it.  Did it come with a remote? Perhaps you need to hook it up to your tv, and you'll be presented with some kind of menu that will enable you to access settings like ip & netmask
[05:48] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: well the cool thing is it says it can run with Linux
[05:48] <nokrev> I'm having two problems with Compiz. 1) I can't seem to figure out how to start it up automatically, even when I mess with GNOME sessions, and 2) when I click a window after activating it, it won't bring it to the top of the stack, unless I click the title.
[05:48] <confusco> well I get 350 FPS on glxgears with a Geforce 2 and 1.4ghz Athlon. is that normal?
[05:48] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: ya searching thru it now
[05:49] <sod75> confusco: way too slow
[05:49] <sod75> I doubt dri is working
[05:49] <confusco> what could be wrong?
[05:49] <syntaxx> fyrestrtr: so this is a problem in ubuntu itself since im using it in debian and it just works fine
[05:49] <mc__> !ati > mrc_001
[05:49] <Beforewisdom> Hirvinen, what are gpg keys and why do ubuntu urls require them in the sources.list?
[05:49] <saimu0> OK  got a question for all of you.... the fonts on my computer look SUPERSRANGE  anything i can do about this?
[05:49] <confusco> glxinfo | grep direct gives : Direct rendering: yes
[05:49] <sod75> confusco: you're not using the right driver ?
[05:49] <rkd> confusco: did you install the binary nvidia driver?
[05:49] <rickyfingers> keithhhhh: found a manual at http://www.airlinktek.com/english/atboard_view.php?param=e_manual&page=1&kind=&uid=51&keyfield=&key=

[05:51] <Beforewisdom> saimuO:  sorry, chinese characters are a bit outside of my expertise.  have you tried theubuntu forums?
[05:51] <keithhhhh> rickyfingers: it says enable NDAS in one of the menus

[05:53] <narrchy> i chose to boot from cd and thats what its telling me

[05:55] <ublender> hrm
[05:56] <boggle> ublender: while not a gui, dvd2divx for mencoder is nice

[05:56] <rickympl> is there a quick way to make a subdir in hundreds of directories, the subdir would b of the same name
[05:56] <carlosqueso> V3nn3tj3...you've got me, hopefully somebody else can
[05:56] <ublender> I am not ttrying to convert dvd

[05:57] <carlosqueso> [#ubuntu] 
[05:57] <Quinn_Storm> true, but the for loop is all shell

[06:01] <narrchy> what do i need to do then before burning?

[06:01] <ublender> boggle: ok
[06:01] <V3nn3tj3> i had a onboard usb but i burned that :/
[06:01] <Quinn_Storm> narrchy: ignore them, if you got as far as the liveCD and you have a 0%, likely the burn just didn't work right, try burning again or ordering from shipit

[06:04] <raistlin> hi
[06:04] <raistlin> yeah.. right
[06:04] <jesse__> I know i can't get a hold of him
[06:05] <raistlin> why?
[06:05] <ublender> Trist_an: gmencoder, if that is what you are referencing too, I have tried before, but could never get it to work
[06:05] <The-Poet> boink: might aswell bind that to a macro ;>
[06:05] <jesse__> i don't know how really?
[06:05] <jdhoreotg> if i do a HD install of Ubuntu from a Live session i've been using for like a day or 2, will everything i've done in the live session be saved on the HD?

[06:05] <The-Poet> jdhoreotg: i don't think it will be saved since it dosen't write changes to the drive

[06:06] <carlosqueso> V3nn3tj3, yeah...that's the file
[06:06] <jesse__> ok, enough with the haikus
[06:06] <raistlin> is there any italian?
[06:06] <jesse__> how should I know
[06:06] <raistlin> Ci sono italiani?
[06:06] <The-Poet> jdhoreotg: this might work, you could copy the home folder you got in the live install and paste it in once you've installed it... but it might not work, and might even mess things up
[06:06] <[BTF] Chm0d> is there a utility for edgy to burn dvds?

[06:06] <jdhoreotg> dammit...not a big deal...i only did some small stuff...also, i'm runnung 6.06 LTS...should i install it then do a dist-upgrade to Edgy Eft?

[06:07] <The-Poet> jdhoreotg: i recommend you to do a clean install. My upgrade went fubar. besides, the diffrences between those two are quite big
[06:07] <grimboy> Does the menu editing thing for gnome in edgy seem really buggy to anyone else. I mean, I try to move something into a subfolder in Games and suddenly the firefox shortcut appears, from nowhere. It's not like I'm even in the internet menu.
[06:07] <VigoFusion> jdhoreotg: Not likeley, you can save the or make an Image to CD and possibly use that and import or extract what you have done.
[06:07] <cwill1> livecd hangs with 'no screens found' using intel 845g (onboard).  anybody know a workaround?

[06:40] <grimboy> Alitoch, So have you reinstalled windows? What version?
[06:40] <Skwid_> or do I have to type them in ????
[06:40] <alitoch> XP Pro
[06:40] <alitoch> and yes, i reinstalled yep
[06:40] <alitoch> the problem i just that it doesn't wanna run windows to complete the setup
[06:40] <alitoch> the problem is in the mbr :(
[06:40] <bieb_work> Alitoch, http://www.bootdisk.com/  go there adn download the Win98 bootdisk, that has fdisk and format
[06:41] <alitoch> and for xp ?
[06:41] <grimboy> alitoch, Yeah, you need to reformat it's damaged
[06:41] <socomm> Doesn't the Ubuntu CD come with fdisk?
[06:41] <SurfnKid> how can i run a check disk on linux/
[06:41] <SurfnKid> ?
[06:41] <alitoch> ok there is an xp version
[06:41] <rickympl> boggle, :)
[06:41] <grimboy> alitoch, Work's for XP as well.
[06:41] <alitoch> grimboy, i've already reformated my hds and my mbr also
[06:41] <socomm> SurfnKid: fsckdisk
[06:41] <njal_> skwid: yes there is
[06:41] <alitoch> bieb_work>> how can i run it ?
[06:41] <Meggie> Hello everyone, please make sure you join #MiracleBlue. :) Thank you.
[06:41] <Meggie> Hello everyone, please make sure you join #MiracleBlue. :) Thank you.
[06:41] <Meggie> Hello everyone, please make sure you join #MiracleBlue. :) Thank you.
[06:41] <Meggie> Hello everyone, please make sure you join #MiracleBlue. :) Thank you.
[06:41] <bieb_work> Alitoch, just use the win98 boot disk to fdisk the mbr and format.. then do the normal windoze install
[06:41] <SurfnKid> socomm, will that trigger it for next boot or right away
[06:41] <VigoFusion> alitoch: The Hard Drive install disks, they are generic bootdisks, many versions can be downloaded at bootdisk.com, but many versions come with the install CD included with Hard Disk drives.
[06:42] <socomm> SurfnKid: No.
[06:42] <grimboy> Alitoch, This is remarkable unhelpful, but you should probably get another hard disk or check the connections inside.
[06:42] <SurfnKid> socomm, right away then
[06:42] <alitoch> oh my god
[06:42] <dream> i setup linux on my server box but have problem i do samba for sharing folder wtih client computer windows xp from samba is ok i can see it on windows xp but on th folder no some can help
[06:42] <alitoch> no grimboy the connections are good
[06:42] <alitoch> it's an mbr prob
[06:42] <socomm> SurfnKid: no.
[06:42] <SurfnKid> next boot?
[06:42] <boggle> rickympl: here's my last shot: find . -depth -type d -exec mkdir "{}/subdir" \;
[06:42] <alitoch> VigoFusion, so I have to download the 4 disks, then makeboot.exe then makebt32.exe and then ??
[06:42] <grimboy> alitoch, But you've reformatted it and it's not working. To my stupidity that sounds like physical damage.
[06:43] <grimboy> (and by my stupidity and mean me)
[06:43] <dream> any one can help
[06:43] <boggle> dream: please rephrase the question, what is the problem?
[06:44] <Zatzum> Does anybody know is it usual that when running ubuntu from live cd i'm not to be able open C drive?

[06:44] <alitoch> bieb_work, it seems like DCC chat doesn't work...
[06:44] <bieb_work> alitoch.. did you get win98 boot disk? should be one floppy
[06:44] <VigoFusion> Boot to it, it will run a diag tool. Find your drive, or ask you to select it from a list, then you can format it to accept data.
[06:44] <willow> hye
[06:44] <SurfnKid> !fsckdisk
[06:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fsckdisk - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:44] <alitoch> grimboy : lol, you're not stupid at all but i'm sure it's not a physical prob
[06:44] <TheGateKeeper> Zatzum, you have to mount it first
[06:44] <alitoch> bieb_work, i got every file
[06:44] <boggle> dream: what does 'on the folder no' mean?

[06:46] <willow> when i lunch my PC i ve got a error 21
[06:46] <boggle> dream: is it publically writable or do you login on the samba share? Do the logs give you any information?
[06:46] <Clinton__> willow: don't eat it then
[06:46] <willow> lol
[06:46] <TheGateKeeper> Zatzum, create an empty directory then type: mount /dev/hda1 <empty dir> (or /dev/sda1 if it's a sata drive)
[06:46] <alitoch> even though i'm on XP bieb_work  ?
[06:46] <bieb_work> yes
[06:46] <alitoch> ok it's downloaded, however
[06:46] <njal_> I am having problems loading ndiswrapper into the kernel and need some help
[06:47] <alitoch> i have boot98sc.exe
[06:47] <alitoch> then ?
[06:47] <TheGateKeeper> Zatzum, man mount will give you more detail
[06:47] <bieb_work> all you want is to boot to the floppy.. fdisk format and then reboot to regular Win install
[06:47] <alitoch> bieb_work, i said i don't have any floppy drive
[06:47] <alitoch> it's a recent laptop unfortunately...
[06:47] <bieb_work> ohhhhhhh
[06:47] <alitoch> could i run it from my live cd ? :'(
[06:47] <bieb_work> I missed that one
[06:48] <Zatzum> okay, thanks
[06:48] <bieb_work> hmmmmm
[06:48] <dream> boggle from the windows i have this 192.168.1.x dt bk linux is not accessible you might hot have permission to use this net work resuce contact the addmistrator of the server to find out if you have acces permission
[06:48] <VigoFusion> The boot sequence is CD, but wich cd is the question?
[06:48] <alitoch> VigoFusion, could you precise your question ?
[06:48] <boggle> dream: ok, do you use a login and password for the share, or anonymous? You probably have to read the samba log information to get this running
[06:49] <socomm> SurfnKid: boot into single user mode.
[06:49] <rickympl> boggle, i think it worked
[06:49] <dream> boggle from the windows i have this 192.168.1.x dt bk linux is not accessible you might hot have permission to use this net work resuce contact the addmistrator of the server to find out if you have acces permission
[06:49] <socomm> SurfnKid: By the way the actual command is fsck
[06:49] <SurfnKid> socomm,  ok
[06:49] <VigoFusion> On recent PCs, Floppy is not installed, but most PCs,Laptops have 2 or 3 CD/DVD Drives, The Boot one has to be selected in the BIOS, from there you can proceed.
[06:49] <SurfnKid> socomm, yeah i couldnt find the other one
[06:49] <SurfnKid> :)
[06:49] <bieb_work> Alitoch... try this one... http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
[06:50] <SurfnKid> but i have to unmount first right
[06:50] <rickympl> boggle, its gonna b a while b4 i can c if it did make a dir in each subdir, but at least it didnt make many dirs with broken names
[06:50] <rickympl> boggle, thx
[06:50] <alitoch> VigoFusion, how can i do that ?
[06:50] <boggle> rickympl: you're welcome, I hope it works
[06:50] <socomm> SurfnKid: Can't recall. To be on the safe side just boot into single user mode and fsck the disk.
[06:50] <njal_> is there anyone around that has edgy and ndiswrapper working?

=== marco13185 is now known as mptech
[06:57] <cwill1> Ayabara: instructions usually point you to put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins, so you should see a single flash-something-blah-blah.so in there
[06:57] <Otter> funkyHat: have you tried playing with differnt TERMs?
[06:57] <Kingsqueak> funkyHat: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/

[06:58] <blekos> could u help me, i have a screen issue

[06:58] <alitoch> bieb_work, because i'm on livecd
[06:58] <cwill1> Ayabara: there's also a newer flash beta you might want to try
[06:58] <alitoch> and even though I install ubuntu, it still doesn't wanna burn
[06:58] <Ayabara> cwill1, thanks (it's opera that has issues)
[06:58] <funkyHat> Kingsqueak, thanks :)

[06:59] <cwill1> evan_LN: i.e., before you start the live cd?
[06:59] <Ayabara> cwill1, it crashes when it tries to use flash 9. from googling I see it is a common issue

[07:11] <Darok>   pon  /j #ubuntu-es
[07:11] <erick> toy wevas
[07:12] <Zylch> well, you are running an operating system within an operating system.. it's bound to use more resources and thus be slower..
[07:12] <navyseal_> hello all
[07:12] <Zylch> hey
[07:12] <jesse___> Confusco:> are you using, WINE
[07:12] <Zylch> where's navy walrus?

[07:12] <erick> uhm
[07:12] <erick> ayuden ps
[07:12] <erick> parqa chatear
[07:12] <sysdoc> Darok, no you'd still have to unmount the volume
[07:12] <ataq> WINE sucks
[07:12] <erick> no se ingles
[07:12] <confusco> I have 1 game that is native on Linux as well, that was quite a bit slower, and WINE A LOT slower
[07:13] <ataq> what game?
[07:13] <confusco> Tribes 2
[07:13] <ataq> drivers
[07:13] <sysdoc> Darok, see the man pages for tune2fs
[07:13] <ataq> what card have you?
[07:13] <Otter> Is there a howto on doing a "manual" install of Ubuntu, like the way you do for Gentoo? Maybe I can figure out my problem going that way
[07:13] <erick> ??
[07:13] <confusco> Geforce 2, I DID install the drivers..
[07:13] <ataq> prop drivers?

[07:13] <sysdoc> Otter, check the wiki
[07:13] <Darok> sysdoc: ok... i think unmounting might not be suitable for me, Ive already tried fsck once mounted.. it was bloody :(
[07:13] <ataq> edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change driver "nv" to "nvidia"
[07:13] <confusco> did

[07:14] <confusco> so I'd like to fix
[07:14] <bieb_work> Otter... the alternate CD is the manual way to install
[07:14] <ataq> check your xorg conf again to be sure
[07:14] <stalefries> erick: con la '/'
[07:14] <Zylch> bah, only 350?

[07:20] <stalefries> bulmer: that kind of stuff is being worked on
[07:20] <segfault_> bulmer, ull have to sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[07:20] <stalefries> bulmer: X isn't really capable of thinking on its own :)
[07:20] <segfault_> bulmer, stalefries is telling u x wont recognize and reconfig itself, at least not yet
[07:21] <bulmer> segfault_ I tried that but it says the dpkg-reconfigure is not installed in mine yet
[07:21] <segfault_> bulmer, use sudo

[07:21] <stalefries> ah
[07:22] <stalefries> navyseal_: what did it say about your model?
[07:22] <navyseal_> i've tryed to go with cups local host
[07:22] <navyseal_> that is supported
[07:22] <segfault_> bulmer, dpkg-reconfigure should be in /usr/sbin hopefully ur path is just screwed, cuz it would very bad if u were actually missing that comman

[07:23] <bulmer> ArreLex: I have a working Ubuntu dapper with a pci card..I have another AGP card that I replaced that pci card, now at boot up, it says X is not configured correctly, so it dumped me in a terminal mode

[07:24] <jeoz> While upgrading to u-6.10, I BROKE the gnome desktop!  I can open the terminal with a right click on the face but there is no graphical response on the screen; the wallpaper is installed, but there is no response in the task-tray to change windows (of which there are 4).  Is there a magic command which will bring my gnome desktop back to live?  (The KDE desktop was upgraded successfully).
[07:24] <segfault_> ArrenLex, plz goto off topic to continue this ridiculus discussion ( iwill not follow)

[07:25] <ArrenLex> segfault_ to continue this rediculous discussion with whom, precisely?
[07:25] <blekos> my screen resolution is somehow stack
[07:25] <segfault_> ArrenLex, plz goto off topic to continue this ridiculus discussion ( i will not follow)

[07:25] <ArrenLex> segfault_: I heard you the first time, thanks.

[07:26] <blekos> is there anyway i can copy the file from the cd to my HD?
[07:26] <blekos> the configuration file
[07:26] <syntaxx> how can i reload module on boot?
[07:26] <ArrenLex> blekos: which configuration file? x?
[07:26] <blekos> i gues so

[07:28] <ArrenLex> blekos: restart what?
[07:28] <stephans> checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[07:28] <bulmer> ArrenLex: when it is in Live CD..the /etc/ exist or is it supposed to be in somekind of /proc  ?
[07:28] <ArrenLex> blekos: you'll have to be actually running the livecd to be able to do this.
[07:28] <blekos> session,
[07:28] <blekos> oh i c
[07:28] <stephans> I need to compile rdesktop 1.5
[07:28] <stephans> ubuntus rdesktop is depricated...
[07:28] <ArrenLex> bulmer: the livecd creates a complete filesystem for itself.
[07:29] <stephans> What does that error mean and how do I make it work?
[07:29] <ArrenLex> stephans: what error?
[07:29] <blekos> since i have a dual core laptop, and installed 386 edgy eft, sould i make a clean install of another version?
[07:29] <blekos> 686 or smg?
[07:29] <stephans> ArrenLex: hecking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[07:29] <blekos> or i can just upgrade the kernel?
[07:29] <navyseal_> need help with printer
[07:29] <ArrenLex> blekos: No, you should be fine. Check to make sure "cat /proc/cpuinfo" has two entries.
[07:30] <ArrenLex> stephans: did you apt-get install build-essential?
[07:30] <stephans> ArrenLex: Whoy would the compiler not be able to create executables
[07:30] <blekos> would u mind telling me how do i do that?
[07:30] <ragnar_123> can I use my canon pixma mp110 on ubuntu, as a network printer, which is connected to a win xp box?
[07:30] <stephans> ArrenLex: let me check...
[07:30] <Otter> The edgy installer seems to work (dapper didn't) with these newer HP servers.. didn't load the ether module, but detected the serial SCSI.. twice as fast as SATA (wow)
[07:30] <segfault_> syntaxx, add the module to /etc/modules
[07:30] <ArrenLex> stephans: because you're missing a linker or assembler, I'm assuming, since you may not have installed build-essential
[07:30] <syntaxx> segfault_: ok thanks
[07:31] <stephans> ArrenLex:  build-essential: Depends: libc6-dev but it is not going to be installed
[07:31] <ArrenLex> stephans: did you modify /etc/apt/sources.list?
[07:32] <stephans> ArrenLex:  I added some lines from ubuntuguide.org
[07:32] <stephans> to get multimedia stuff to work
[07:32] <kanzie> Does anyone here know Ezmlm that can help me with configuration
[07:32] <ArrenLex> stephans: they may be interfering. Try "aptitude -t edgy install build-essential"
[07:33] <VigoFusion> Can I run Knoppix and Ubuntu on the same HD?
[07:33] <blekos> ArrenLEx: got only 1 cpu core
[07:33] <ArrenLex> blekos: paste the output of "uname -r"
[07:33] <liri> it seems like something is either wrong with my cpu scaling or with my cpu itself...
[07:33] <confusco> how do I exit X server?
[07:33] <stephans> ArrenLex:  Wow...!
[07:34] <navyseal_> need help with printer

[07:34] <liri> powernowd is running and i see my cpu *constantly* on 1ghz or 59% which is... ODD! any ideas?
[07:34] <stephans> ArrenLex:  I am dapper though... shuld I just replace egy with dapper?
[07:34] <ArrenLex> stephans: oh! That explains it. Yes, dapper.
[07:34] <stephans> ArrenLex:  wow -- it semed smart...

[07:35] <ubotu> Cpudan80: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[07:36] <liri> confusco: it restarts it cause you're probably in init 5
[07:36] <ArrenLex> blekos: I heard, hold on
[07:36] <confusco> what should I be in?
[07:36] <segfault_> liri, why is that odd? and what cpu?
[07:36] <saimu0> Im trying to install a font nd it just keeps telling me   "you are not root"  when i dropp the TFF file into fonts folder   whats this about anyone?
[07:36] <blekos> sorry,
[07:36] <Cpudan80> Anyone know how to change the icon on the GNOME menu?
[07:36] <Cpudan80> Like the one to the left of the Applications button
[07:36] <n3rdism> saimu0 #sudo nautilus
[07:36] <confusco> liri, what init should I be in then?
[07:36] <ArrenLex> saimu0: you,uh, have to be root.
[07:36] <stephans> ArrenLex:  OK - if found that libc6-dev was broken but did not change anything
[07:36] <saimu0> but how do i do that?
[07:36] <n3rdism> saimu0 #sudo nautilus
[07:36] <saimu0> ive never needed to do that.
[07:36] <saimu0> just that?
[07:37] <liri> segfault_: because it always moved around from 1gh to 1.66ghz but now it stays the same and i know its bad cause im having some issues like the laptop would freeze for a few seconds every like 15 minutes (happens both in windows and linux)
[07:37] <n3rdism> that opens a nautilus browser as root
[07:37] <ArrenLex> stephans: and what happens if you try "apt-get install libc6-dev/dapper"?
[07:37] <liri> confusco: well init 5 is fine. how about you try to kill the process?
[07:37] <confusco> which process then?
[07:37] <saimu0> i type that into terminal and then ~~  nothing.
[07:37] <liri> confusco: xorg i'm assuming
[07:37] <s-ndh-c> hey guys
[07:37] <confusco> oh ok
[07:37] <Cpudan80> Anyone?
[07:38] <s-ndh-c> i have a problem with sshfs
[07:38] <n3rdism> saimu0: don't include the #?
[07:38] <s-ndh-c> it doesnt seem to work
[07:38] <saimu0> ok
[07:38] <segfault_> liri, if same freezing issues in windows and linux sounds like a hardware issue
[07:38] <n3rdism> =)
[07:38] <s-ndh-c> is sshfs or maybe fuse broken in edgy?
[07:38] <saimu0> haha  <im new  you can guess right!>
[07:38] <cwillu> s-ndh-c: what's the problem?
[07:38] <Malachi> I removed some orphaned and archived packages a while ago, to free up some space, and now my multimedia applications like Amarok and Totem crash.
[07:38] <stephans> ArrenLex:  i tried apt-get remove: Package libc6-dev is not installed, so not removed
[07:38] <cwillu> s-ndh-c: you're in the fuse group, right?
[07:38] <liri> segfault_: i agree but i need to debug it somehow to see where is it coming from since this happened out of the blue for me...
[07:38] <s-ndh-c> cwillu: i cant mount anything, if i execute sshfs as user i get an error about /dev/fuse permission denied
[07:39] <s-ndh-c> cwillu: yes iam
[07:39] <cwillu> yep
[07:39] <ArrenLex> stephans: why remove?
[07:39] <n3rdism> saimu0 its ok =)
[07:39] <cwillu> no, you're not
[07:39] <n3rdism> welcome to ubuntu saimu0

[07:40] <s-ndh-c> and if i execute that as root i cant access the mounted dir
[07:40] <s-ndh-c> even as root i cant see anything in there
[07:40] <cwillu> s-ndh-c: and you're sure you added yourself to the fuse group?
[07:41] <n3rdism> confusco: if you're using grub, just hit esc when it starts to load, and pick the kernel with safemode on it

[07:41] <confusco> alright, thanks
[07:41] <n3rdism> np
[07:41] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, if you haven't logged out and back in since you added yourself to the fuse group, you need to run "newgrp fuse"
[07:41] <segfault_> liri, u chk to see u ahve the correct modules loaded for ur cpu speed stepping?  also iirc cpufreqd is another speed step daemon u only need one, that or powernowd
[07:42] <n3rdism> anyone have any experience setting up DNS on an ubuntu box?
[07:42] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: i did logout, do i have to stop gdm too?
[07:43] <liri> segfault_: lsmod | grep cpu shows: cpufreq_userspace cpufreq_stats freq_table cpufreq_powersave cpufreq_ondemand cpufreq_conservative
[07:43] <s-ndh-c> still the same
[07:43] <s-ndh-c> permission denied
[07:43] <segfault_> liri, next thing to do is to make sure only one speed step daemon is running
[07:43] <cwillu> s-ndh-c: can you paste me the command line you're using?
[07:44] <liri> segfault_: you're correct about the two packages maybe... how do i check if cpufreqd is installed? i do have cpufrequtils installed.
[07:44] <cwillu> (for the record, I use sshfs all the time on dapper and edgy, so it should work)
[07:44] <confusco> still no go
[07:44] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, did you run "sudo adduser <username> fuse" (of course replace <username> with your username)
[07:44] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: i did gpasswd -a to add me to the group
[07:44] <confusco> I need to kill Xorg, but Nvidia installer says it's a bad idea to be in init 1 for installation
[07:44] <s-ndh-c> is that bad?
[07:45] <CharlieSu> would anyone like to help me test my DenyHosts setup?  I need a few brute force attempts at my SSH daemon if anyone is willing..  charlie.phunki.com
[07:45] <n3rdism> confusco: you're installing nvidia drivers?
[07:45] <confusco> yes
[07:45] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, no idea.. I've never used gpasswd.. use the command I gave you and try again.
[07:45] <n3rdism> confusco: did you download nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-legacy?
[07:45] <confusco> nvidia-glx is open source ones?
[07:45] <n3rdism> yes
[07:45] <sn9> well, hopefully somebody today might know how i can fix my problem...
[07:46] <segfault_> liri, run this dpkg -l | grep cpufreqd if u get output then cpufrqd is installed
[07:46] <s-ndh-c> it says iam in that group allready
[07:46] <confusco> somebody suggested I try the official nvidia ones from their site, I can't get my game to run fas
[07:46] <confusco> t
[07:46] <s-ndh-c> i think the problem is the permissions on /usr/bin/fusermount
[07:46] <saimu0> whats the string to log in as root again?
[07:46] <Kingsqueak> sudo
[07:46] <s-ndh-c> michi@ubuntu:~$ ls -lh /usr/bin/fusermount
[07:46] <s-ndh-c> -rwsr-x--- 1 root fuse 19K 2006-10-12 12:33 /usr/bin/fusermount
[07:46] <cwillu> CharlieSu: its denying me now
[07:46] <saimu0> ok
[07:46] <s-ndh-c> i think thats wrong
[07:46] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, no, that's fine
[07:47] <s-ndh-c> ok
[07:47] <blekos> any ideas how to get my system recognize the two corees?
[07:47] <Skwid_> hum
[07:47] <Kingsqueak> saimu0: 'sudo -s' gives you a root prompt
[07:47] <n3rdism> confusco: 3 easy steps.
[07:47] <n3rdism> 1. sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[07:47] <n3rdism> 2. ctrl+alt+backspace
[07:47] <n3rdism> 3. sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:47] <n3rdism>          change driver "nv" to "nvidia"
[07:47] <n3rdism>        save and ctrl+alt+backspace again
[07:47] <Skwid_> i still cant get a sidebar in nautilus
[07:47] <s-ndh-c> it should make me root while executing this
[07:47] <Skwid_> it looks like this
[07:47] <Skwid_> http://img382.imageshack.us/img382/1566/screenshot1zz8.png
[07:47] <Skwid_> any idea ?
[07:47] <confusco> huh?
[07:47] <s-ndh-c> what could it be then?
[07:47] <confusco> I already did that.
[07:47] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell n3rdism about paste | n3rdism, you have a private message from Ubotu
[07:47] <confusco> I want to install the nvidia official driver
[07:47] <liri> segfault_: i checked like this before, its not installed then. another odd thing is that i think cpu frequency isn't working cause if i manually change the cpu speed from the gnome applet i keep seeing cpu MHz: 1662.724 on /proc/cpuinfo...
[07:47] <saimu0> sudo nautilus opens this nautilus?
[07:47] <ataq> confusco: did you download the official driver?
[07:47] <Kingsqueak> saimu0: that will run nautilus as root...I wouldn't recommend doing that
[07:47] <confusco> yes
[07:47] <Skwid_> saimu0: yep, sudo looks the same
[07:47] <n3rdism> eh, sry. didn't know doing shift+enter would make a new line
[07:48] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, what do you get when you run the command "groups"
[07:48] <jeoz> ArrenLex:  have re-installed ubuntu-desktop; will reboot and see what happens.
[07:48] <confusco> I need to kill Xorg, but Nvidia installer says it's a bad idea to be in init 1 for installation. so how do I kill Xorg, but stay in Init 4 or 3 whatever Edgy uses?
[07:48] <ataq> confusco: what have you tried,
[07:48] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: fuse adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin michi antivir
[07:48] <saimu0> Swid  ~~  can i ak you something
[07:48] <saimu0> ?
[07:48] <CharlieSu> cwillu: thanks man
[07:48] <ataq> confusco: ctrl alt esc
[07:48] <Skwid_> saimu0: yea
[07:48] <s-ndh-c> cat /etc/group|grep fuse shows that iam in there too
[07:48] <s-ndh-c> something is wrong
[07:48] <saimu0> why does ubuntu have two font folders one in USR and one in ETC?  or ECT
[07:48] <s-ndh-c> :)
[07:49] <confusco> ctrl alt esc? doesn't do anything
[07:49] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, ok, what is the output of ls -l /dev/fuse
=== Kuriturisu is now known as Manko
[07:49] <ataq> confusco: sorry ctrl alt F1
[07:49] <segfault_> confusco, alt-ctl-f1 then login then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[07:49] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: crw-rw---- 1 root root 10, 229 2006-11-22 19:18 /dev/fuse
[07:49] <saimu0> Kuriturisu   you know manko is a really bad word?
[07:49] <confusco> that doesn't kill xorg..
[07:49] <meuserj> ah..
[07:49] <Manko> xD
[07:49] <Skwid_> uh ????
[07:49] <ataq> confusco: it does....
[07:49] <Skwid_> anybody can help me with my nautilus ?
[07:49] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, sudo chgrp fuse /dev/fuse
[07:50] <Manko> saimu0 yeah
[07:50] <Manko> im learning japanesse
[07:50] <Manko> xD
[07:50] <ataq> confusco: if you press them simultaniously
[07:50] <saimu0> o  ok
[07:50] <cwillu> CharlieSu: did you want me to continue trying to crack it?  :)
[07:50] <Manko> lol
[07:50] <saimu0> yeah  i can tell
[07:50] <CharlieSu> cwillu: sure..
=== Manko is now known as BockBilbo
[07:50] <FlyingSquirrel32> where can I get libartsc0-dev version 1.5.5 ???? It's required by libsdl1.2 but it's not in the repos!!
[07:50] <saimu0> manko thats better
[07:50] <saimu0> haha
[07:50] <Zaggynl> Is it possible to have Beryl in dapper without XGL?
[07:50] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: thx that did it
[07:50] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, np
[07:50] <confusco> it doesn't kill Xorg though
[07:50] <confusco> just switches virtual console as far as I can see
[07:50] <FlyingSquirrel32> Zaggynl: you can use AIGLX instead
[07:50] <s-ndh-c> meuserj: is there something wrong with the udev rules? or why has the permission been wrong?
[07:50] <BockBilbo> saimu0 anyway
[07:50] <ataq> confusco: well that is what I did and it works, and then kill GDM
[07:51] <Skwid_> http://img382.imageshack.us/img382/1566/screenshot1zz8.png any idea ?
[07:51] <liri> segfault_: i keep seeing this in /var/log/syslog: kernel: [17184616.160000]  psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio4/input0 lost sync at byte 1
[07:51] <segfault_> Zaggynl, yes for nvidia cards u can use the latest nvidia driver and do not need xgl
[07:51] <confusco> ok kill gdm
[07:51] <confusco> ok
[07:51] <saturn_> Does anybody speak Russian? -  -?
[07:51] <liri> segfault_: which is probably when the computer (mouse and keyboard) are freezing...
[07:51] <BockBilbo> mm dont know in your culture, but in spain we say its equivalent all the time
[07:51] <Zaggynl> segfault_, okay cool, would you have a howto on that?
[07:51] <confusco> !ru
[07:51] <ubotu>    #ubuntu-ru       /  Pozhalujsta vojdite v #ubuntu-ru dlq pomoshchi na russkom qzyke
[07:51] <njal_> anyone good with ndiswrapper
[07:51] <njal_> ?
[07:51] <ataq> confusco: !ru?
[07:51] <darkmatter> russian
[07:51] <ataq> ahh
[07:51] <raplhu88> is there a way to select what packages i want installed when installing ubuntu?
[07:51] <segfault_> Zaggynl, there are some on the beryl site/forums
[07:52] <meuserj> s-ndh-c, no idea.
[07:52] <Moose_> Good morning... anyone here know why 6.06LTS-x86_64 isn't seeing both cores on an Athlon 3800x2?
[07:52] <segfault_> liri, r u dapper or edgy?
[07:52] <ataq> smp kernel maybe?
[07:52] <carl> ls
[07:52] <ataq> install smp
[07:52] <carl> configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
[07:52] <Moose_> it's an SMP kernel.
[07:53] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell carl about build-essential | carl, you have a private message from Ubotu
[07:53] <Moose_> 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue May 23 13:45:47 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[07:53] <carl>  how can one overcome above error ^^^ ?
[07:53] <liri> segfault_: dapper. my fresh install was from flight 7 and then i upgraded only some packages like kernel and others, didn't do an entire apt-get upgrade...
[07:53] <carl> sudo apt-get install _____________ ?
[07:53] <ataq> strange, what does it say in System monitor?
[07:53] <ataq> one core?
[07:53] <Moose_> I'm looking at /proc/cpuinfo, I don't have graphic access to the machine yet.
[07:54] <ataq> why no graphics?
[07:54] <raplhu88> is there a way to select what packages i want installed when installing ubuntu? like if i don't want sound or games installed
[07:54] <Moose_> I _suppose_ i can start a remote X session. :)
[07:54] <ataq> doubt you will need two cores for text based install . .
[07:54] <ataq> oh right!
[07:54] <Moose_> but I'm sitting on the end of a dialup connection at the moment.
[07:54] <ataq> your not local no?
[07:54] <nothlit> ralphu you use the alternate or server cd and then add the extra stuff you need later
[07:55] <Moose_> Nope. not yet. :-)
[07:55] <ataq> lol, I dunno so!
[07:55] <raplhu88> thx nothlit.
[07:55] <nothlit> You can place all the debs you need on a disc if you need to do it netless
[07:55] <binks> anyone seen this x error b4
[07:55] <Skwid_> please :(
[07:55] <binks> X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168
[07:55] <Moose_> I can go grab clean kernel source and build from scratch, that's not a problem to do, but if there's an easy ubuntu-esque fix i'd rather do that.
[07:55] <s-ndh-c> why can i not see this fuse stuff in nautilus?
[07:55] <ataq> what ubuntu have you?
[07:55] <astro73> my /home fs (hda7) went read-only. how do I restore it?
[07:55] <ataq> 6.10?
[07:56] <nothlit> They'll be in /var/cache/apt/archives if you've installed them before or you can use aptitude -d install packages here, or as always just download them from the package repo site
[07:56] <s-ndh-c> it just doesnt show the dir
[07:56] <Skwid_> http://img382.imageshack.us/img382/1566/screenshot1zz8.png any idea ?
[07:56] <s-ndh-c> :)
[07:56] <Moose_> 6.06LTS.
[07:56] <Lin> hi all.. there is any ubuntu package to latest nvidia drivers?
[07:56] <ataq> and what cpu have you?
[07:56] <sn9> Moose_: you might be having a problem with acpi and/or apic
[07:56] <ataq> Lin: check ubuntu forums
[07:56] <Moose_> model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+
[07:57] <meuserj> aSt3raL, sudo mount -o remount -a
[07:57] <Moose_> sn9: ewww evil! apic is not my friend.
[07:57] <darkmatter> Skwid... sorry.. just noticed your call for help.. supp?
[07:57] <ataq> Moose_: I think there is a mistake cos I have a similar cpu and I auto detected the two cores on the 64bit install also
[07:57] <sn9> if you don't want to deal with apic, forget smp
[07:57] <darkmatter> * Skwid_
[07:57] <Lynoure> astro73: Did you do something to cause it?
[07:57] <Moose_> ataq: hmmm ok. I can deal with it, doesn't mean i like it :-)
[07:58] <Skwid_> darkmatter: it seems my nautilus is different from everyone else'S :)
[07:58] <darkmatter> oh... let me look at that pick
[07:58] <darkmatter> 1 sec
[07:58] <ataq> Moose_: Well when I uname -a it says SMP #1 too, but when I look graphically it shows two cores!
[07:58] <darkmatter> ahh... kk
[07:58] <darkmatter> easy fix Skwid_
[07:58] <darkmatter> :)
[07:59] <Skwid_> darkmatter: no sidebar, no top tree folders etc
[07:59] <Skwid_> darkmatter: how ? :)
[07:59] <Lin> ataq are you talking about launchpad?
[07:59] <darkmatter> yup.. its easy to fix
[07:59] <ataq> Lin: ubuntuforums.org
[07:59] <Skwid_> i looked all over the menus ..
[07:59] <confusco> hi, Nvidia installer gives me: No precomplied kernel interface was found to match your kernel
[07:59] <ataq> Lin: then search for Nvidia Driver how to
[07:59] <Lynoure> astro73: you could try remounting it. mount -o remount,rw /home
[07:59] <ataq> Lin: it gives great step by step
[07:59] <darkmatter> Skwid_, open Applications > System Tools > Configuration editor
[07:59] <Lin> ataq: the howto way i know how to do.. ;-)
[07:59] <rick_> could someone help me move the file rar into /usr/bin
[08:00] <Lin> i wish a easy apt-get :-)
[08:00] <Lynoure> astro73: or perhaps add   sudo  to the start of it
[08:00] <Lin> im lazy in latest years
[08:00] <ataq> Lin: So what is it you are asking?
[08:00] <confusco> Nvidia installer gives me "No precomplied kernel interface was found to match your kernel"  What should I do?
[08:00] <sizzam> rick_: did you install 'rar' from the repos?
[08:00] <Skwid_> darkmatter: hum, i dont have that entry
[08:00] <Lin> i want add a repository and apt-get it.
[08:00] <Lin> :-)
[08:00] <Moose_> ataq: tres weird, I've never seen /proc/cpuinfo report the wrong information before.
[08:00] <sizzam> confusco: have you tried installing the nvidia driver out of the repos
[08:00] <darkmatter> Skwid... kk... easy enough to fix that too
[08:00] <Skwid_> darkmatter: ok, i launched gconf-editor from the terminal
[08:00] <darkmatter> ;)
[08:00] <rick_> sizzam: no downloaded it from rarlabs.com is there a better way?
[08:00] <confusco> yes
[08:00] <confusco> don't want that
[08:00] <Moose_> mmost of my experience is with slackware where if you want it done you do it manually yourself or it doesn't happen.
[08:01] <ataq> confusco: it lets you build from source, did you read the how to's? install kernel source
[08:01] <sizzam> rick_: yes, just do this from a command line:    sudo aptitude install rar
[08:01] <darkmatter> lol.. Skwid_  beat me too it
[08:01] <darkmatter> anyway
[08:01] <rellis> I have an HP DL360G4 with 2x on-board Broadcom NetXtreme BCM5704 NIC's. They're both plugged into good switch ports (i.e. I switched the cables a few times). However when I run ethtool on them eth1 has link and sets duplex/link speed whereas eth0 has no link and duplex/speed are undetermined. Any idea why this would be happening?
[08:01] <FlyingSquirrel32> why is libartsc0 v1.5.5.0 in the repos but libartsc0-dev v1.5.4 is the most recent dev for it?
[08:01] <confusco> what how-tos?
[08:01] <Skwid_> darkmatter: now ? )
[08:01] <Skwid_> :)
[08:01] <nothlit> Does anyone know when you edit the dfsbuild config if you have to explicitly set each and every package needed or if it will do auto dependency resolution?
[08:01] <FlyingSquirrel32> FlyingSquirrel32: libartsc0-dev v1.5.4 requires that libartsc0 be of the eame version
[08:01] <ataq> Moose_: On my Fedora machine, I installed Core 6 and it set my Pentium D 820 as i586 single core.. ..  ..  joke
[08:01] <rick_> sizzam: alright I think i did it
[08:01] <darkmatter> Skwid_,  go to apps > nautilus > preferences
[08:02] <Skwid_> darkmatter: im there :)
[08:02] <sizzam> rick_: k, now you should just be able to issue the command 'rar' from any command line
[08:02] <ataq> Moose_: it was sickening
[08:02] <liri> segfault_: is there an easy way to see the cpu temp? maybe its over heated? (although it doesnt feel like it)
[08:02] <Moose_> rellis: does lspci -v show the two devices as the same hardware?
[08:02] <ataq> confusco: ubuntu forums, how tos
[08:02] <rick_> sizzam: could I use it with archive manager?
[08:02] <Moose_> ataq: What's the kernel source package name for 6.06 LTS?
[08:02] <darkmatter> Skwid_, look for the entry always_use_browser and check it
[08:02] <ataq> confusco: did nVidia installer quit?
[08:02] <sizzam> rick_: i believe so, give it a shot
[08:02] <Moose_> I can just grab that and compile my own.
[08:02] <Moose_> a working .config would be very helpful however. :-)
[08:02] <ataq> confusco: I am not sure tbh. I dont run 6.06
[08:02] <Skwid_> darkmatter: hum, its not there, ill create it
[08:02] <confusco> well, no.
[08:03] <nothlit> Does anyone know if tar backups will work for an ntfs system?
[08:03] <rick_> sizzam: archive manager says "Archive not supported."
[08:03] <confusco> it gave me an error
[08:03] <rellis> Moose: Yes.
[08:03] <astro73> the dmesg log is at <http://pastebin.com/830790>
[08:03] <rellis> Moose: They're identical NIC's.. as I said.. onb-board.
[08:03] <darkmatter> its not there??? weird
[08:03] <Moose_> nothlit: yes, but you lost all NTFS permissions / ownerships.
[08:03] <sizzam> rick_: hang on a sec
[08:03] <rick_> sizzam: does archive manager need to update somehow?
[08:03] <Moose_> rellis: same PCI IDs and everything?
[08:03] <ataq> Moose_: uname to get the kernel and is it .src at the end to get?
[08:03] <Skwid_> darkmatter: HA ! there we go :D
[08:03] <darkmatter> lol
[08:03] <Skwid_> darkmatter: why wasnt the entry even there ?
[08:03] <Moose_> I've seen identical onboard nics not be identical. :)
[08:03] <gop> what windows manger does xunbuntu use
[08:03] <Moose_> ataq: that works, let me try
[08:04] <gop> !xubuntu
[08:04] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[08:04] <sn9> i upgraded breezy to dapper on powerpc, and now firefox does a SIGILL. any ideas?
[08:04] <sizzam> rick_: try sudo aptitude install unrar
[08:04] <darkmatter> Skwid_, dunno, sounds like the schema never installed properly
[08:04] <Skwid_> darkmatter: i guess i should've done a clean install of edgy :)
[08:05] <darkmatter> gop, xfce uses xfwm4
[08:05] <ataq> rick: what do you want an unrar program?
[08:05] <rellis> 0000:02:02.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5704 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)
[08:05] <rellis> 0000:02:02.1 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5704 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)
[08:05] <rellis> Moose: That's what I see in lspci.
[08:05] <gop> what if I installed xfwm seperate
[08:05] <gop> and then I use sudo apt-get install xubuntu-deskto
[08:05] <gop> or do
[08:05] <rick_> sizzam: still says archive type not supported
[08:05] <Moose_> rellis: ok, that's a good sign. :-)
[08:05] <gop> !kubuntu
[08:05] <ubotu> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[08:05] <Moose_> rellis: sudo ifconfig eth0 up
[08:05] <darkmatter> Skwid_, lol... that sounds reasonable
[08:05] <Moose_> rellis: sudo ifconfig eth1 up
[08:05] <rellis> Moose: hehe.. it is.. however I still can't transfer any data over it ;)
[08:05] <Moose_> then test your status again
[08:05] <sizzam> rick_: did the unrar package install when you issued that last command?
[08:06] <SpriteSODA> guys
[08:06] <ataq> gop: and do you want gnome aswell?
[08:06] <Skwid_> darkmatter: :)
[08:06] <darkmatter> gop.. yup.. you can install xfwm4 on its own
[08:06] <Skwid_> darkmatter: i got to go now, but thank you veryyyyyyyyyyy much
[08:06] <SpriteSODA> how can i "cd" to folders which their names end with a number?
[08:06] <darkmatter> Skwid_,  np
[08:06] <darkmatter> anytime
[08:06] <rellis> Moose: Yes, still the same.
[08:06] <rick_> sizzam: 0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 170 not upgraded.
[08:06] <patrick_king> does nayone know where i can get pycurses from
[08:06] <Moose_> hmmm.
[08:06] <Moose_> that's strange.
[08:06] <rick_> sizzam: it is a fresh install of ubuntu from a disk.. do I need to update ubuntu?
[08:06] <ataq> rick_: What application do you want?
[08:07] <Moose_> Have you tried a different switch, just to be safe?
[08:07] <Moose_> or a crossover cable?
[08:07] <rellis> Moose: Speed: Unknown! (65535), Duplex: Unknown! (255), Link detected: no.
[08:07] <rick_> ataq: I'm trying to install rar to work with archive manager
[08:07] <SpriteSODA> how can i "cd" to folders which their names end with a number?
[08:07] <sizzam> rick_: if you go to Applications > Accessories > Archive Manager, click New, then click Archive Type, is RAR listed in there?
[08:07] <rellis> Moose_: Yes, I've had the server out of the rack on my desk a few days.
[08:07] <rick_> sizzam: no it is not
[08:08] <gop> dark,  compared to gnome how does one compare xubuntu
[08:08] <ataq> rick_: rar labs rar have a command line rar/unrar utility free on there site, its quite good. no hassle, just works. I recommend it
[08:08] <gop> or xfwm is thier any advantges
[08:08] <Moose_> rellis: hmm. If you go on the premise that you have to make it as simple as possible, then you should eliminate the switch and try a crossover cable.
[08:08] <Moose_> if the crossover cable doesn't work, you have a driver/card problem.
[08:08] <Tatster> Hi everyone.  I tried the Ubuntu live cd to see what the newest release of Ubuntu was like.  First off, I got the menu screen and then shortly after that it crashed with a kernel panic, and now I can't boot my original windows.  :-(
[08:08] <Moose_> if the crossover cable does work, it's the switch.
[08:08] <gop> Tatster,  try fix mbr
[08:08] <ataq> Tatster: what is your specs?
[08:08] <gop> !mbr
[08:08] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[08:08] <rellis> heh, yes, as I said I've tried several different hubs/switches, that's nto the issue.
[08:08] <sizzam> rick_: did you enable all the repos in Synaptic yet?
[08:09] <SpriteSODA> how can i "cd" to folders which their names end with a number?
[08:09] <rellis> Moose_: eth0 goes into the same switch..
[08:09] <rellis> Moose_: I can even plug eth0's cable into wth1 and it still works.
[08:09] <rick_> sizzam: no i do not think so.. i'm a newbie to linux again lol.. how may i go in doing that
[08:09] <rellis> eth1*
[08:09] <sizzam> rick_: no problem
[08:09] <Moose_> rellis: so one port is happy, one isn't at all?
[08:09] <sizzam> rick_: sudo synaptic
[08:09] <Tatster> I'm just booting off the windows CD to go to recovery console
[08:09] <rellis> Moose_: Yes, exactly.
[08:09] <Moose_> that sounds like a bad card more than anything, or some really funky IO conflicts.
[08:09] <sizzam> rick_: then Settings > Repositories
[08:10] <Tatster> Had to rummage around to find my SATA drivers on a flooy
[08:10] <sizzam> rick_: check all the boxes, then click the close button
[08:10] <rellis> Moose_: Yet as I said I've gone through three replacement system boards, I eventually had HP swap the entire chassis. I've had the same issue with all of them.
[08:10] <sizzam> rick_: then click reload
=== rmbl`off is now known as rmbl
[08:10] <Moose_> rellis: as a sanity check, have you tried booting something like knoppix?
[08:10] <rick_> sizzam: I do not see check boxes
[08:10] <segfault_> liri, think u need lmsensors installed and configed for that
[08:10] <rick_> sizzam: the packages in synaptic package manager?
[08:11] <rellis> Moose_: It was a RHEL 3 system.. I installed ubuntu 6.06 just to see if it was osmething weird I fubard..
[08:11] <rellis> Moose_: Exact same output as RHEL.
[08:11] <Moose_> so the problem follows the hardware...
[08:11] <sizzam> sizzam: after synaptic opens, click Settings, then Repositories
[08:11] <Moose_> that does sound like hardware to me.
[08:11] <Moose_> but after 3 system boards, that's tres weird.
[08:11] <sizzam> rick_: after synaptic opens, click Settings, then Repositories
[08:11] <gop> !xubuntu
[08:11] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[08:11] <rellis> 3 system boards.. and an entire new server
[08:11] <Tatster> ataq: AMD 2500+, 1GB RAM, 120GB SATA HDD
[08:11] <SpriteSODA> guys how do i "cd" to a folder named: Sid Meier's Civilization 4
[08:11] <rellis> So I just don't get it..
[08:11] <Moose_> rellis: 2 CPUs? or one?
[08:12] <Moose_> Can't hurt to try knoppix if you have it there.
[08:12] <sn9> SpriteSODA: put it in quotes
[08:12] <sizzam> SpriteSODA: cd Sid (hit tab key)
[08:12] <rellis> Moose_: Yep, 2x 3.6GHz Xeon's.
[08:12] <rick_> sizzam: ok did that
[08:12] <mc__> SpriteSODA:  cd "Sid Meier's Civilization 4"
[08:12] <Moose_> I've heard that the Broadcom nics are not supported well under Linux from a few places.
[08:12] <sizzam> rick_: k, did you click reload
[08:12] <mc__> SpriteSODA: or just type Sid[HIT TAB] 
[08:12] <rellis> Moose_: Hmm..
[08:12] <rick_> sizzam: o ok i see the reload button now
[08:13] <sizzam> rick_: ok, what you just did is add all the software package options that ubuntu doesn't enable by default
[08:13] <sizzam> rick_: now, once that is done reloading, close it, and then do this from command line:   sudo aptitude install rar unrar
[08:13] <SpriteSODA> yea tab did the trick thx
[08:13] <tfny_> Is there a program for web analytics like webalizer but which accepts only referer and ip (for hits/vists +referer) ? because awstats and the other have required fileds which are too big for my log file after some days
[08:14] <Moose_> rellis: We've got probably ~200 servers up with various OSes and the best supported nics we've found are the Intel E1000's with the NForce ethernet a close second.

[08:20] <aum> hi - after loading ftdi_sio, I'm not seeing /dev/ttyUSB0 - how do I get usb serial working in edgy?
[08:20] <sn9> i upgraded breezy to dapper on powerpc, and now firefox does a SIGILL. any ideas?
[08:20] <rellis> Lynoure: Their hardware is supported by Linux Kernel modules... it ran fine in production for 6 months.. then all of a sudden started doing this after a power failure. I've got an entirely new replacement unit now and I'm getting the same crap.
[08:20] <osah> I wanted Linux/Windows, So i installed GRUB to C:\ Where my Windows is. And now when i go to the OS Choice menu and Pick Windows it doesnt boot. :/ Is my Windows Hard Drive Gone?
[08:21] <rellis> osah: You need to re-install NTLDR.
[08:21] <FlyingSquirrel32> this is retarded! I can't install libsdl1.2-dev without unresolvable dependancies!
[08:21] <rellis> osah: Install grub to the MBR and then put NTLDR back on the windows partition.
[08:21] <CharlieSu> cwillu: I don't see any attempts...
[08:21] <osah> rellis how could i do that over ubuntu live cd? if possible?
[08:21] <FlyingSquirrel32> Is it just me? or is someone working on it?
[08:21] <rellis> osah: Sorry I don't have time to walk you through it right now.
[08:22] <osah> Also one more, I installed Ubuntu -- But the installation never asked me for root password, now i dont know the root apssword?
[08:22] <sn9> osah: there is none
[08:22] <patrick_king> is the package  pycurses in repos. could some one look for me as im in ssh and i dont know how to find it via ssh

[08:31] <Malachi> =\
[08:31] <Malachi> I thought I got them all, but apparently not.
[08:31] <IndyGUnFreak> ok, then the best bet, is to uninstall ALL of them.

[08:33] <vnese> IndyGUnFreak: and my swap space is about 256mb too
[08:33] <IndyGUnFreak> well, i can't help, sorry, i cruise along with 1024mb and a 2gig swap...lol
[08:33] <wiz> ok I'm all upgraded to edgy, now how do I get the newest nvidia drivers / nvidia-settings and set it up so I can toggle tv-out without resetting X?
[08:33] <IndyGUnFreak> no probs at all.
[08:33] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: do you mind posting your /etc/apt/source.list on pastebin?
[08:33] <IndyGUnFreak> ganshino, did you figure out your problem?
[08:34] <patrick_king> no prob

[08:35] <markl_> what is the best way to debug dvd ripping problems?
[08:35] <mats> the "login screen" , isnt it?
[08:35] <gethoht> hi everyone
[08:35] <jramsey> any recommended email apps other than Evolution?
[08:35] <shini`> the splash screen for X
[08:36] <shini`> after you log in the splash comes up
[08:36] <markl_> jramsey: i use mutt
[08:36] <shini`> unless you disable it
[08:36] <Bilange> ooops :s
[08:36] <wow> can someone please look at this problem? it seems to be affecting ubuntu at a very weird filesystem level
[08:36] <wow> http://phpfi.com/177563
[08:36] <IndyGUnFreak> i guess i've never noticed it.
[08:36] <mats> yes, what i ment :p hehe - my poor english
[08:36] <shini`> you can change the login screen, too
[08:36] <jramsey> markl_, where would i find a distro for mutt?
[08:36] <SpriteSODA> is there's any other software which does things like cedega?
[08:36] <wow> if you use ssh, bash, and edgy, i'd look at http://phpfi.com/177563
[08:36] <shini`> wine
[08:36] <patrick_king> flysqurriel32: it keeps saysing  /etc/apt/source.list: No such file or directory
[08:36] <VigoFusion> jramsey: Have you tried SeaMonkey or Thunderbird standalone?
[08:36] <shini`> cedega is based on wine though
[08:36] <IndyGUnFreak> Spirit, depends on whaty ou want to play
[08:36] <jramsey> VigoFusion, no
[08:36] <IndyGUnFreak> Wine is ok.
[08:36] <IndyGUnFreak> I've had pretty good luck with Crossover Office
[08:36] <dream> Any one can help, i setup linux in my server box, samba server is work fine but when i cam to the folder cant open it some can help
[08:36] <gethoht> i have a themes question... i'm on ubuntu 6.06 and when I try to install a theme from gnome-look.org, i get a "file format invalid" error when I try to drag and drop the tar.gz file into the theme manager?  is there some step I am missing?
[08:37] <SpriteSODA> Civilization IV
[08:37] <shini`> Crossover is really good from what i hear
[08:37] <IndyGUnFreak> but my neds are minimal.
[08:37] <jramsey> i want a nice gui interface that isn't crummy like outlook and wasn't written by novell
[08:37] <markl_> jramsey: apt-get install mutt
[08:37] <segfault_> SpriteSODA, wine can play some games
[08:37] <shini`> I want to get my counter-strike set up on my  ubuntu, too
[08:37] <VigoFusion> jramsey: according to the Mozdev site, Thunderbird and Seamonkey work, it is also listed in some of the forums.
[08:37] <Bilange> for the X splash screen, you can do either: run "gksudo gdmsetup", or go to System, Administration, Login Window
[08:38] <sn9> i upgraded breezy to dapper on powerpc, and now firefox does a SIGILL. any ideas?
[08:38] <VigoFusion> I have not installed Tbird yet , but will be soon.
[08:38] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: never mind, I think i found the problem! I had to downgrade a different package...
[08:38] <IndyGUnFreak> SN9, did you upgrade, or did you do a clean install?
[08:38] <segfault_> shini`, i havent tried the newest wine, but older versions like 9.10 were a bear to get cs:s going and performance didnt compare to cedega
[08:38] <shini`> Bilange, which part lets me change the splash?
[08:38] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32:noprob
[08:38] <shini`> Bilange, i see the option to disable it but i haven't found one to change the image(s)
[08:38] <sn9> IndyGUnFreak: i just said i upgraded
[08:38] <SpriteSODA> wine fails to load the game

[08:39] <segfault_> !pastebin | SpriteSODA
[08:39] <ubotu> SpriteSODA: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:39] <shini`> segfault_, i'm trying for cs 1.6 -- but i tried cedega and it's giving issues with steam for some reason
[08:39] <jramsey> SpriteSODA, use pastebin
[08:39] <shini`> segfault_, the steam login window is totally blank and I can't type in it... UNless i'm supposed to install CS a different way
[08:39] <Bilange> wait a sec-- are you talking about the image in the center that says "loading metacity", or the actual login screen just before?
[08:39] <SpriteSODA> oh sry=] 
[08:39] <IndyGUnFreak> lol
[08:39] <Moose_> what's the name of the binary which will show you system info under X?
[08:40] <SeanTater> are there any audio cd rippers that support manually choosing a place to rip the cd to (not automagically) and allow choosing which CDDB entry to use?
[08:40] <segfault_> shini`, i used the cedega trial a few months ago and had no issues steam installed fine, chk the forums for cedga liley someone else had and fixed that issue
[08:40] <mats> shini`: you install cs from steam. Cedega would be the best emulator
[08:40] <shini`> Bilange, I mean the screen that says what it's loading... I already changed my login :)
[08:40] <FlyingSquirrel32> patrick_king: Thanks a lot!

[08:41] <ktrauberman> Have there been any reported issues with getting the ipw3945 wireless card working in edgy?
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> SeanTater: most all are configurable for target dirs...or do you want one that prompts you each time you run it?
[08:41] <taggartbg> i'm running xubuntu, but people over there don't seem to know how to help...so i figured you might be able to...i'm trying to get wifi-radar/wpa_supplicant to work, and i had wifi-radar scanning earlier, but when i tried to get wpa_supplicant working, the terminal started spitting this out whenever i try to run wifi-radar: wlan0   failed to read scan data : operation not permitted...any ideas?
[08:41] <segfault_> ktrauberman, i have that card in edgy with no issues
[08:41] <ktrauberman> hmm
[08:41] <ktrauberman> i installed network-manager-gnome
[08:41] <shini`> Bilange, i've actually changed it before in the past... in Ubuntu 6.06 but i forgot what i did... i think i might have just copied some files but I don't remember how i selected the splash screen
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> SeanTater: I like yaret quite a lot, it's perl and you can edit it as you please
[08:41] <ktrauberman> and it doesn't list any wireless network support at all
[08:42] <jramsey> is there a pkg for Thunderbird?
[08:42] <anto> Hello
[08:42] <shini`> ktrauberman, personally I don't use any GUI utilities i find that more often then not they don't work
[08:42] <sn9> ktrauberman: there is a trick to the network manager
[08:42] <rarj> Hi I just downloaded the dapper addon cd. I dont have a spare CDROM to write it to... How do I install it off my USB Flash Drive ?
[08:42] <Bilange> shini`, well If I am not mistaken about what image you want to change, I found a tutorial (for dapper, though) here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=11478
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> jramsey: 'apt-cache search thunderbird'
[08:42] <segfault_> ktrauberman, im not using network-manaer imusing wpasupplicant, and works like a charm
[08:42] <ktrauberman> and when i use the built-in network monitor, with a manual ssid, it won't connect either
[08:42] <ktrauberman> even to an open network
[08:42] <mats> jramsey: apt-cache search thunderbird
[08:42] <SeanTater> Kingsqueak: asking me every time is whta I'm looking for (Although I think I just got sudiocd:/ to work, so thanks anyway)
[08:42] <ktrauberman> i'll try wpasupplicant
[08:43] <Alzi2> Hey. I'm trying to install a GTK engine called Murrine but it does not work.. still remains clearlooks... why does this happen?
[08:43] <mats> rarj: can you computer boot from usbdrives?
[08:43] <ktrauberman> sn9: wnat's the trick?
[08:43] <anto> can somone tell me how do fix a problem i have on my server, when i try to install ubuntu 6.0.6 Dapper drake, i get the error isolinux: Disk error 80, ax = 4200, drive 9f
[08:43] <SpriteSODA> a thought?
[08:43] <VigoFusion> jramsey: at mozdev is a linux download, I am uncertain as to what works or doesnt  I am a totall noob to this stuff.
[08:43] <rarj>  Hi I just downloaded the dapper addon cd. I dont have a spare CDROM to write it to... How do I install it off my USB Flash Drive ?
[08:43] <sn9> ktrauberman: you gotta manually edit /etc/network/interfaces
[08:44] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: nm generally only fails when your driver isn't loaded
[08:44] <jramsey> the pkg is mozilla-thunderbird and it won't install
[08:44] <ktrauberman> okay i'll try that sn9
[08:44] <DigitalNinja> is there a Dapper package for Gnucash 2
[08:44] <IndyGUnFreak> off a flash drive rarg.. no idea.
[08:44] <wiz> I installed nvtv, but it's telling me Fatal: No supported video card found. My card is:  nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5500]  is that not supported?
[08:44] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: if the driver isn't loaded, the interface isn't up and nm has nothing to manage, nm has nothing to do with loading the driver
[08:44] <ktrauberman> Kingsqueak: The driver is loaded I think
[08:44] <VigoFusion> http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: if you do 'ifconfig -a'
[08:45] <ktrauberman> i'll pastebin by iwconfig
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: you see eth1 or wlan0 etc?
[08:45] <jramsey> oops apt-get update was needed
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: k
[08:45] <ktrauberman> eth1
[08:45] <michael117> Does anyone know how I could setup a user account I have for my dad to be in Polish, while keeping my account's interface in English?
[08:45] <VigoFusion> http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/
[08:45] <grimboy> HUGS!
[08:45] <grimboy> Ok, fine, I'll just hug myself.
[08:45] <mats> Kingsqueak: if you see a eth1 or wlan0 your card-drivers is in you system
[08:46] <mats> your*
[08:46] <patrick_king> !python curses
[08:46] <ktrauberman> hmm
[08:46] <sn9> michael117: you just choose a language when you log in
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> mats: it should be if the wireless is in fact eth1 and it's not another physical port
[08:46] <ubotu> python: An interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version). In component main, is important. Version 2.4.3-11ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 37 kB, installed size 208 kB
[08:46] <ktrauberman> now iwconfig is'nt showing eth1
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: ;-)
[08:46] <patrick_king> !pythoncurses
[08:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pythoncurses - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:46] <grimboy> Yay! I can feel the love irradiating from this channel.
[08:46] <ktrauberman> i did try playing with ndiswrapper last night, think that could be causing it
[08:46] <VigoFusion> jramsey:last post is TBird from Mozdev, it says LinuxGTK and 86 somethin?
[08:46] <ktrauberman> because it WAS showing up yesterday
[08:47] <mats> Kingsqueak: it schould be. if you do a "/sbin/ifup eth1" what does it say or do?
[08:47] <patrick_king> !curses
[08:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about curses - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:47] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: nm also requires that /etc/network/interfaces has nothing setup but the 'lo interface
[08:47] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: it takes over all your network setup for you
[08:47] <rick_> how can i update hoary to the newest ubuntu?
[08:47] <ktrauberman> okay
[08:47] <michael117> sn9: Under the preferences>Language selector? His account does not have administrative rights, though.
[08:47] <marie> hello
[08:47] <segfault_> ktrauberman, maybe u do not need ndiswrapper for ipw3945
[08:47] <grimboy> patrick_king, Curses for python annoys me because it's not cross-platform.
=== mc44 is now known as towel
[08:47] <ktrauberman> i'll check taht
[08:47] <ktrauberman> yeah
[08:47] <Lynoure> rick_: I do not think you can, directly
[08:47] <ktrauberman> i just disabled ndiswrapper
[08:47] <[BTF] Chm0d> hey guys does anyone know if you can access your linux files through vmware?
[08:47] <Kingsqueak> ahh for 3945 you definitely don't
[08:47] <sn9> michael117: no, on the login screen
[08:47] <ktrauberman> i'll reboot
[08:47] <ktrauberman> then edit that file
[08:47] <ktrauberman> and see if it fixes it
[08:48] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: if you installed ndis and it's a 3945, remove ndis too
[08:48] <marie> are there any guides to installing kubuntu on a macbook pro for a dual boot with osx?  I just got the kubuntu 6.06 iso
[08:48] <Kingsqueak> ktrauberman: ipw3945 is a plain kernel module
[08:48] <rick_> lynoure: really? :(.. could i just keep on doing all the upgrades till its the newest
[08:48] <ktrauberman> okay
[08:48] <ktrauberman> i'll brb gonna reboot to make sure this is clear
[08:49] <anto> can somone tell me how do fix a problem i have on my server, when i try to install ubuntu 6.0.6 Dapper drake, i get the error isolinux: Disk error 80, ax = 4200, drive 9f
[08:49] <Lynoure> rick_: or you could backup and install edgy directly. Updating from dapper to edgy is not always that smooth anyway
[08:49] <IndyGUnFreak> Lyn.. exactly what i would do,.
[08:49] <gansinho> please I would like to know how do I change my default media player? I want to use the keyboard shortcuts in Listen, but they just work in rhythmbox ...
[08:49] <SpriteSODA> how do i apply the d3d9 patch for wine? its a .diff file
[08:49] <IndyGUnFreak> there's been a lot of peoiple reporting trouble upgrading from Dapper.
[08:49] <rick_> lynoure: how can i install it directory I only have a 5.04 cd
[08:49] <VigoFusion> jramsey: I have absolutely no idea if Thunderbird works in Gnome/Ubuntu, I will pastebin it to the Debian/Linux and see....
[08:50] <Bilange> [BTF] Chm0d, im not sure of your setup, but if you want to access files on another filesystem than those installed in your virtual machine, chances are that you can't directly... the workaroudn is to create a windows share/FTP server, anything like that
[08:50] <juanfe> hello all
[08:50] <mtlife> is it possible to read the mail from www-data in an other account? (local mail?)

[08:51] <Lynoure> rick_: you cannot burn the new one?
[08:51] <juanfe> Anyone uses firefox throws proxy server with NTLM auth?
[08:51] <mtlife> Kingsqueak: how do I do that?

[08:52] <mtlife> Kingsqueak: and will all mail already in the box be send too?
[08:52] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: do you have a base install or did you add postfix or something?
[08:52] <VigoFusion> RTFM and BTFU are the 2 golden rules of any Network Admin.

[08:53] <txus> Hi!
[08:53] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: ah use 'postalias /etc/aliases' then
[08:53] <SiCuTDeUx> elkbuntu: congratulations for the award
[08:53] <grimboy> IndyGUnFreak, I like that kde one that's like nero.
[08:53] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: via sudo  'sudo postalias /etc/aliases'
[08:53] <SpriteSODA> how do i apply the d3d9 patch for wine? its a .diff file
[08:54] <rick_> so 6.10 is the newest ubuntu?
[08:54] <txus> Anyone with Realtek High Definition Audio and alsa runnig??????
[08:54] <mtlife> Kingsqueak: what is the difference, postalias adds the line for me I guess?
[08:54] <bimberi> rick_: yes
[08:54] <grimboy> rick_, stable, yes
[08:54] <IndyGUnFreak> i hate nero.

[08:54] <confusco> I installed and then uninstalled the official nvidia drivers, then installed nvidia-glx-legacy again, and "nvidia" in xorg.conf now seems to want to use the official nvidia drivers i've unintalled and gives a "file not found" error. how do I make it use the nvidia-glx-legacy, which also I think is supposed to use the word "nvidia"??
[08:54] <Lynoure> rick_: yes, but some people (me included) stick to dapper (6.06)
[08:54] <Kingsqueak> juanfe: http://blogs.wdevs.com/shog9/archive/2005/03/09/2668.aspx   google 'firefox NTLM'
[08:54] <IndyGUnFreak> under windows, probably the best burner program, is on MajorGeeks.com, is called DeepBurner Free
[08:54] <IndyGUnFreak> great program
[08:54] <gethoht> disregard my question, it seems that art.gnome.org has some helpful tutorials
[08:55] <Lynoure> rick_: 6.06 is the latest long term support version.
[08:55] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: no, you have to add the line yourself, postalias processes the change in the file you made so it can read it
[08:55] <mtlife> Kingsqueak: ok tx :)
[08:55] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: the actual file it reads is aliases.db it's a database file
[08:55] <Kingsqueak> mtlife: postalias creates that db for you
[08:56] <jramsey> thunderbird users know how to config thunderbird so it automatically checks for email every X minutes?
[08:56] <mtlife> Kingsqueak: I see, thank you :)

[09:00] <Figgy> just a quick question. what is the terminal command so i can get the busid of my pci-e graphics cards?
[09:00] <Loppan> Crownless: checked out Jack
[09:00] <carl> yes

[09:01] <VigoFusion> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934 Thats for an ATI ,but let me look some more.
[09:01] <Kingsqueak> jramsey: yeah I think that's in account settings too
[09:01] <stalefries> carl: sudo apt-get install gnome-sword
[09:01] <stalefries> carl: it may be universe/multiverse
[09:01] <jramsey> am looking ...
[09:01] <kitche> jramsey: what kind of signature you mean just a text based one?
[09:02] <stalefries> !universe | carl
[09:02] <ubotu> carl: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:02] <pascal25> thanks bimberi
[09:02] <pradalover> Hi, I am a beginner at Ubuntu and Linux(os). Therefore, my questions my sound really foolish...
[09:02] <pascal25> i will try it and i 'll say you tomorrow
[09:02] <pascal25> have a nice night
[09:02] <Lynoure> pradalover: just ask :)
[09:02] <carl> universe/multiverse ?
[09:02] <stalefries> pradalover: we're all beginners at some point! :) Out with the question!
[09:02] <pascal25> bye
[09:02] <IndyGUnFreak> its ok prada, our answers probably wont make sense...lol
[09:02] <Figgy> for some reason in my xorg.conf file it doesn't state the busid of the card it's using.
[09:02] <confusco> I installed and then uninstalled the official nvidia drivers, then installed nvidia-glx-legacy again, and "nvidia" in xorg.conf now seems to want to use the official nvidia drivers i've unintalled and gives a "file not found" error. how do I make it use the nvidia-glx-legacy, which also I think is supposed to use the word "nvidia"??
[09:02] <kitche> Figgy: busid is optional
[09:02] <Crownless> hmmm plz help! cant figure out how 2 get multiple audio exits to function, or if its possible!
[09:02] <pradalover> thank god..
[09:03] <IndyGUnFreak> prada, whats the issue?
[09:03] <minerale> Does anyon here use tin? is it possible to have tin connect to more than one news server? I post to certain newsgroups on two different servers, Is this possible in tin?
[09:03] <IndyGUnFreak> issue(s)
[09:03] <Figgy> i am trying to specify it so that way I can specify using 2 cards
[09:03] <VigoFusion> confusco: the apperent problem lies in Unistall and useing Xorg/fglrx many problems are caused by partiall installs of existing apps or installs that are not interworking with the current system.
[09:03] <Alzi2> Hey all... I have a really annoying problem... I just installed a GTK engine (murrine) but all that changes if I select a theme that uses it, is the color. It remains clearlooks but almost nothing changes... anyone? i need help with this quick.....
[09:03] <bimberi> pascal25: yw :)  - it seems to recommend using the S600 driver which should be in Ubuntu
[09:03] <jramsey> kitche, yeah, like my name company name address phone etc; basic stuff
[09:03] <jramsey> a graphic would be nice too
[09:03] <campbch> ello.
[09:03] <confusco> VigoFusion, so what do I do???
[09:03] <kitche> jramsey: yeah that's udner account settings thought you meant a gpg signature
[09:03] <Devil_Kin> hey folks.. is there any news somewhere to be found on the next ubuntu release?
[09:03] <Alzi2> please, someone help me :(
[09:04] <rogue780> does anyone know of a linux flashget type program that allows downloading from multiple mirrors at the same time?
[09:04] <stalefries> !ubuntu+1 | Devil_Kin
[09:04] <bimberi> ubotu: tell Devil_Kin about feisty | via /msg
[09:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntu+1 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:04] <bruenig> Devil_Kin, it will be named feisty fawn, will come up april 14 I think, that is about it. Should have a more general user focus. i.e. ui changes and multimedia enablement etc.
[09:04] <campbch> i'm trying to get LMMS to work; it was working before, but something changed and now it crackles while running. i've checked all of the sound packages, and no other programs are misbehaving... hydrogen, rosegarden, my media players...

[09:04] <IndyGUnFreak> rogue, you mean like bit torrent?
[09:04] <kaptengu> xdmcp is not working for me, how do I troubleshoot it?

[09:04] <vanksi> hi, i'm a long time gentoo user but decided to try ubuntu on my laptop, the problem is that when i tell the installer to install grub to sd0 the grub install fails (the drive is sata), i'm dualbootin with WinXP
[09:04] <campbch> imagine sticking a ruler into a cieling fan
[09:04] <VigoFusion> confusco: I would suggest searching the forums for your particular install/apt, then useing the suggestions that worked from there.
[09:04] <pradalover> will Ubuntu install php, Apache and Mysql all from the synaptics Manager
[09:05] <SupremacyGnu> Hey, i'm trying to run WoW with Teamspeak at the same time. I can hear other people but they cant hear me. Infact, the green button doesn't even light up when pressing the push-to-talk button? Thanks

[09:05] <Alzi2> hello?
[09:05] <stalefries> pradalover: if you tell it to, yes
[09:05] <jramsey> kitche, i must be blind
[09:05] <jramsey> i don't see it
[09:05] <stalefries> !anybody | Alzi2
[09:05] <ubotu> Alzi2: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[09:05] <IndyGUnFreak> Alzi, just post your question
[09:05] <IndyGUnFreak> if someone can answer, they will
[09:05] <vanksi> 6.10+SATA drive+GRUB, anyone had any problems?
[09:05] <jramsey> kitche, nevermind
[09:06] <pradalover> I think I did it right...How can I tell for sure
[09:06] <jramsey> i see it
[09:06] <Trainstroker> how do i setup a wireless networks?
[09:06] <rogue780> sn9, does it have a gui?
[09:06] <campbch> i asked pretty directly, noone seems to know
[09:06] <kitche> jramsey: hang on let em start my thunderbird
[09:06] <IndyGUnFreak> Train, i would suggest prayer
[09:06] <campbch> is there any reason sound would be crackling in a fresh install of LMMS? i have all of the required sound packages, and it was working before
[09:06] <Crownless> HELP (again)! cant figure out how 2 get multiple audio exits to function, or if its possible! (ubuntu - dapper)anyone have an idea? ive already given up google and ubuntuusers (germ.) HELP!! PLZ!!
[09:06] <razo1> hi
[09:06] <bruenig> if the sound file had crackling in it
[09:07] <stalefries> wow, so busy here
[09:07] <bruenig> !hi | razo1
[09:07] <ubotu> razo1: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:07] <razo1> i have problems with generic kernel and nvidia-glx
[09:07] <campbch> well, the trick is, it's doing it just because the program is open.
[09:07] <IndyGUnFreak> lol, that would be a good reason bruenig
[09:07] <jramsey> kitche, i think i found it but it looks like i need to create a text file then point tbird to it
[09:07] <RadiantFire> Crowless: System-Preferences-Sound
[09:07] <razo1> with 386 its works fine but with generic no way :(
[09:07] <RadiantFire> switch the default soundcard
[09:07] <rogue780> afk
[09:08] <erf> Any help with my VNC problem?
[09:08] <carl> after editing sources.list you have to do something to update sources?
[09:08] <stalefries> carl: sudo apt-get update
[09:08] <Crownless> radiantfire i cant seem to find it there - all i can set is which sounds i want playd
[09:08] <campbch> if i change the sound server to jack, nothing plays, and with oss it gives static rather than crackling
[09:08] <taggartbg> wlan0 failed to read scan data : operation not permitted - anyone know how to avoid this?
[09:08] <kitche> jramsey: maybe sicne I jsut know how to do the gpg signatures
[09:08] <bruenig> update sources - sudo apt-get update
[09:08] <RadiantFire> Crownless: it should be at the very bottom of one of the tabs
[09:09] <RadiantFire> i can't remember what the dapper one looks like, cuz I'm on edgy
[09:09] <RadiantFire> but it should be at the bottom of the sounds tab
[09:09] <Crownless> i have 2 tabs radiantfire
[09:09] <RadiantFire> a dropdown box named Default sound card
[09:09] <sn9> rogue780: no, but there are those that do. that's just the one i know
[09:09] <RadiantFire> Sound Tab very bottom, Default sound CardL
[09:09] <Jinkguns> is it possible to run xgl and compiz with onboard video?
[09:09] <Crownless> the only thing i can see is standard sound"card"
[09:09] <RadiantFire> yeah, hit the dropdown box
[09:09] <bruenig> Jinkguns, #ubuntu-xgl
[09:09] <carl> " Couldn't find package gnome-sword"
[09:09] <bruenig> Jinkguns, I don't think so. I couldn
[09:09] <bruenig> 't
[09:10] <RadiantFire> if both soundcards are supported, then you will see them
[09:10] <campbch> jinkguns: im doing it right now
[09:10] <carl> am I spelling it wrong?
[09:10] <Crownless> thats intel ICH  what do i do there? i have only one to choose from radiantfire
[09:10] <campbch> jinkguns: on intel 915, no less :p
[09:10] <jramsey> kitche, bear with me; what is a gpg signature? and i got the text file signature to work
[09:10] <Jinkguns> lol
[09:10] <campbch> jinkguns: it's ok, but it doesnt do water
[09:10] <RadiantFire> Crownless: then you don't have two sound output devices
[09:10] <paologenoa> ciao a tutti
[09:10] <carl> is there something like apt-get info?
[09:10] <carl> or...?
[09:10] <stalefries> !gpg | jramsey
[09:10] <ubotu> jramsey: gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
[09:10] <Jinkguns> camp
[09:10] <bruenig> carl, what is gnome-sword? maybe I can find its real name
[09:10] <jramsey> stalefries, txs
[09:10] <Jinkguns> did you follow a guide?
[09:11] <stalefries> welcome
[09:11] <campbch> i was going to, but it just worked(tm)
[09:11] <Crownless> o.O i have a sound output with up to 4 output channels ... why should i not have them radiantfire
[09:11] <Crownless> ?
[09:11] <carl> it's just the gnome version of the sword project
[09:11] <RadiantFire> oh, Crownless i thought you meant soundcards
[09:11] <bruenig> carl, sudo apt-get install gnomesword,
[09:11] <campbch> use adept to install beryl, then run beryl-manager and it will load default settings
[09:11] <bruenig> carl, no -
[09:11] <RadiantFire> Crownless: the output channels are on a per application basis
[09:11] <Crownless> hmm sry, im an ubuntu noob, clearer plz? radiantfire
[09:12] <VigoFusion> YAY! my screen is a little larger, not much, but its an advance in the proper direction.:)
[09:12] <RadiantFire> Crownless: each application will have a way of configuring the sound output channels
[09:12] <RadiantFire> for instance, totem, the movie player has its own way of configuring
[09:12] <kitche> jramsey: gpg signature is good for identifing that a package or an e-mail comes from someone
[09:12] <diskus> Is there any big reason to install 64-bit ubuntu and not 32-bit if computer supports both?
[09:12] <RadiantFire> I don't think rhythmbox has a way of change it, which is kind of sad
[09:12] <carl> gnomeword, that's it.  It's working, thanks
[09:12] <RadiantFire> i'm not really sure
[09:12] <Jinkguns> campbch: did you follow a guide?
[09:12] <bruenig> diskus, no
[09:12] <Crownless> radiantfire - so if im using rythmbox ill find it there? - oh
[09:13] <jairomagalhaes> anybody knows something about flash plugin for x86 64 to firefox ????
[09:13] <diskus> bruenig: no performance increase in normal day to day use at all?
[09:13] <RadiantFire> i do not know of a way to change it in rhythmbox
[09:13] <diskus> jairomagalhaes: I heard flash doesn't work on 64-bit platform at all
[09:13] <RadiantFire> I think it should default to using all things thogh
[09:13] <diskus> jairomagalhaes: not even in windows, not sure about that
[09:13] <kitche> jairomagalhaes: you have to use a plugin wrapper to get flash to work inside a x86_64 browser
[09:13] <VigoFusion> Im listening to some freaky trance music now, wheeeeeeeee!
[09:13] <sn9> diskus: every computer that supports 64-bit ubuntu also supports 32
[09:13] <campbch> ok, one last time: I am trying to get LMMS working again. It was working previously, but now it only plays crackling sounds even when there is nothing supposed to be playing. I have reinstalled LMMS and made sure all of my sound packages are installed. I have tried changing the server to OSS, Jack as opposed to ALSA, and it gives static and nothing, respectively. Programs such as Hydrogen, Rosegarden, Kaffeine, Flash, everything else has perfect sound.
[09:13] <campbch> What should i do?
[09:13] <bruenig> diskus, I could barely see anything different performance wise. Any performance that may be boosted is certainly outweighed by the difficulties of getting basic things like flash and java and others
[09:14] <diskus> bruenig: that's what I wanted to know
[09:14] <campbch> jinkguns: i said no, i was going to and didn't need to
[09:15] <Crownless> radiantfire hmmm, cant seem to find anything :(
[09:15] <Crownless> thx thouwh radiantfire
[09:15] <RadiantFire> i'm looking
[09:15] <RadiantFire> hang in there, I have hope
[09:15] <campbch> jinkguns: here's a quick guide - find beryl in adept, install it, and type beryl-manager in alt+f2 run menu
[09:15] <jairomagalhaes> plugin wrapper ????
[09:15] <campbch> if it doesnt work, then look for a guide
[09:15] <campbch> noone is able to help with the sound problems?
[09:15] <Crownless> thx radiant
[09:15] <carl> thanks all
[09:15] <carl> later
[09:16] <RadiantFire> Crownless: sorry, no dice
[09:16] <RadiantFire> i found where you can change it, but it won't let you
[09:16] <jairomagalhaes> some place to learn about pluguin wrapper ???
[09:16] <stalefries> jairomagalhaes: what do you mean?
[09:16] <Crownless> darn - thx again radiantfire - where is it exactly? sometimes i get lucky :p
[09:17] <RadiantFire> there is a program  you can run called gconf-editor that lets you change things
[09:17] <bigfoot780> any body sucessfully got .mov files palying and able to also play dvds?
[09:17] <RadiantFire> its the gstreamer musicaudiosink
[09:17] <geokok> can anyone help install HP ScanJet 3670?
[09:17] <Jinkguns> also, how do I map a samba network space in a default eft install?
[09:17] <stalefries> jairomagalhaes: if english isn't your native language, there are ubuntu support channels in other languages
[09:17] <Jinkguns> I can't find a menu link to smbclient
[09:17] <RadiantFire> Crownless: the one thing you can try doing is starting Totem the movie player going to preferences and changing audio output type
[09:17] <RadiantFire> Crownless: with luck that might change the rhythmbox one as well
[09:17] <stalefries> Jinkguns: System>Administration>Sharing?
[09:17] <Crownless> radiantfire: thx ^^
[09:18] <Jinkguns> stalefries: I just want to access the network space, not host any
[09:18] <pascal25> hey bimberi
[09:18] <pascal25> it's ok for the printer
[09:19] <stalefries> Jinkguns: Places>Network Servers
[09:19] <stalefries> I think
[09:19] <pascal25> it's operate wonderfull
[09:20] <Jinkguns> hmm
[09:20] <cmweb> Can any one tell me how to make a message box pop up via the terminal.
[09:20] <Crownless> darn - it didnt change rythmbox as well
[09:20] <Crownless> :(
[09:20] <cmweb> i need tsomething to signal a successful
[09:20] <LjL> !info zenity | cmweb
[09:20] <ubotu> zenity: Display graphical dialog boxes from shell scripts. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1026 kB, installed size 3104 kB
[09:21] <cmweb> ljl, thanks
[09:21] <Crownless> it didnt even change it for itself :(
[09:21] <Mook> Anyone have a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card working w/ spdif?
[09:21] <cmweb> ljl, i got it installed but how do i implement it with a message....
[09:22] <LjL> cmweb: i don't really know, i'm not going to install it because it requires too many Gnome libraries that i don't have. look at its man page, no?
[09:22] <Crownless> radiantfire: thx again ^^
[09:22] <Crownless> cu all!
[09:22] <cmweb> ljl, my bad.... Man i feel like an idiot
[09:22] <LjL> cmweb: i'm reading the manpage on the web - looks pretty simple
[09:23] <stalefries> cmweb: There's a zenity howto in the general Gnome howto. System>Help
[09:23] <cmweb> ljl, thanks
[09:23] <LjL> cmweb: at the end of the manpage there are complete examples as well
[09:23] <cmweb> stalefries, thanks
[09:23] <stalefries> welcome
[09:24] <cmweb> yay, i found it
[09:25] <tim167> I baught this cheap KINGSUN SF620 INFRARED ADAPTER, it has a windows drivers cd only...can it be made to work on ubuntu ?
[09:25] <cmweb> ljl, i see and i like. But this is kind of embarrasing i have never created a script. What is the extension on them
[09:25] <erf> So, anyone?!
[09:25] <aladds> just updated to edgy from dapper after a straight edgy install didnt work right, now i have the same problem, i can't log in, and when i do i just get the login box again just after the login music
[09:25] <aladds> ARGH
[09:26] <acke_ubu> hey guys where can i find information on how to connect from cygwin to my ubuntu server with X11 forwarding?
[09:27] <Fawk3> can anyone help me with a problem? When I try to install ubuntu 6.10, my screen turns blank after the loading on the installation... (I have a ATI 9600 graphic card)
[09:27] <_kalm> hey how'd you use irc again :P how'd you send a message someone
[09:27] <stalefries> cmweb: .sh
[09:27] <eitch0000> I've got a problem: I installed kpowersave, and didn't reboot, then started the app. CPU Scaling worked like a charm, now I rebooted and now cpu scaling isn't even in the menu anymore. Does it have anything to do with the fact, that installing kpowersave removed apmd and powernowd?
[09:27] <stalefries> _kalm: /msg username message
[09:27] <LjL> cmweb: don't need an extension
[09:27] <LjL> cmweb: sometimes they're given an .sh extension, but that's entirely optional. actually, most of the times extensions are entirely optional in Unix
[09:28] <LjL> cmweb: what you *do* need is to make them executable, and put "#! /bin/sh" as the first line
[09:28] <cmweb> ljl, so i can just put "notify" and it will work?
[09:28] <quik_> is there a way to enable /etc/init.d scripts?
[09:28] <LjL> cmweb: what is "notify"?
[09:28] <patrick_king> how do i add a user to sudo list
[09:28] <LjL> patrick_king: make them a member of group "admin"
[09:28] <cmweb> ljl, i got #!/bin/bash  , the notify is the file name
[09:29] <LjL> cmweb: oh. well no, you need to type "./notify" to run it, unless you put it in a directory that's in your PATH
[09:29] <patrick_king> how do i do that
[09:29] <quik_> patrick_king: /etc/sudoers I think
[09:29] <LjL> patrick_king: adduser <username> admin
[09:29] <LjL> quik_: no need, sudoers is already setup to give admin privileges to every member of "admin"
[09:29] <cmweb> ljl, its going to be in the hoem direcoty so the path is /home/clint/notify
[09:30] <patrick_king> adduser pking admin
[09:30] <cmweb> ljl, am i correct
[09:30] <quik_> I guess each way would work though
[09:30] <LjL> cmweb: yes, but no - i wasn't talking about the path of the file, but about the PATH variable
[09:30] <confusco> Somebody help, I uninstalled an nvidia driver and then reinstalled nvidia-glx, and now it's giving me:           dlopen: libGLcore.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory, (EE) Failed to load /usr/lib/xorg/modules/libglx.so, (EE) Failed to load module "glx" (loader failed, 7), FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/kernel/drivers/video/nvidia.ko': No such file or directory, (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kern
[09:30] <base3> hey, i am trying to repair a bootloader that got broken, now i have it that the ubuntu kernel boots fine, then just halts with 'waiting for root filesystem' what am i missing?
[09:30] <VigoFusion> Its a cliky GUI thing, its neato, I made 3 supers and 5 restricted ,just to see if I could, and I did.
[09:30] <cmweb> ljl, il make a past of my file
[09:30] <LjL> cmweb: the reason why you can just type things like, say, "apt-get", "reboot", etc (just random examples) is that those commands are found in directories that are listed in your PATH
[09:31] <LjL> cmweb: type "echo $PATH", you'll see which directories are part of your standard search path
[09:31] <tim167> can a Kingsun SF 620 Infrared Adapter be used on Ubuntu ?
[09:31] <patrick_king> it already says its a member of admin,
[09:31] <patrick_king> but i keep having to do sudo or su
[09:32] <cmweb> ljl, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33338/ Will it work?
[09:32] <LjL> patrick_king: ... uh? of course you need to use sudo
[09:32] <LjL> patrick_king: that's what you asked - adding a user to the sudo list. i.e. the list of people who can use sudo
[09:32] <quik_> LjL: do you know if I have to 'enable' my inti.d/scripts before they will execute?
[09:32] <LjL> cmweb: probably
[09:32] <cmweb> ljl, not that certain.... Whats the reason
[09:32] <LjL> quik_: if you want to execute them by default, yes - use update-rc.d
[09:33] <VigoFusion> By default the first user and all others are sudo/admin,I thought?lemee read some more...
[09:33] <LjL> cmweb: it's that i don't have zenity
[09:33] <LjL> VigoFusion, only the first user created is an admin by default
[09:33] <cmweb> ljl, k im testing
[09:33] <quik_> LjL: So if I run a script, getting no output.. does that mean anything other than the script might be broken / useless?
[09:33] <VigoFusion> Thank you LjL, I was not posative
[09:34] <LjL> quik_: might mean many things. scripts in /etc/init.d are supposed to give you some output (like "starting xyz... ok"), so if you get no output, there probably is something wrong. which script is that?
[09:34] <cmweb> ljl, It was successful.... Thanks
[09:34] <liri> is the tifm_sd module available only in edgy? I'm on dapper and I can't find it...
[09:34] <sven-tek> i know its a strange but, is there any chance to have a underline cursor instead of the block cursor in the gnome-terminal?
[09:34] <quik_> LjL: Its a lighttpd script
[09:34] <patrick_king> one thing that bugs me is one user can do ls and there are different colours per folder but another user with same privs dont get colour any reason for this
[09:34] <matason> Hi I am installing Ubuntu onto a USB HDD, it gets to about 25% insalling system then the progress bar just disappears - any ideas?
[09:34] <quik_> I'll find a copy of it..
[09:35] <stalefries> patrick_king: user preferences
[09:35] <LjL> quik_: on Edgy?
[09:35] <patrick_king> stalefries: what that?
[09:35] <stalefries> patrick_king: for example, I changed my colors to use the Tango palette
[09:35] <elros> hey, i just asked a question from my other nick about not being able to log into edgy
[09:35] <LjL> quik_, the lighttpd package is broken apparently. i can't get it to install without failing to launch the startup script
[09:35] <stalefries> patrick_king: Users can change what colors each type of item uses
[09:35] <elros> then my other computer locked up
[09:36] <quik_> LjL: Unsure. I'm using a VPS
[09:36] <elros> so, er, how do i log in?
[09:36] <LjL> quik_: wait nevermind, that was my fault
[09:36] <quik_> LjL: I installled from source.. the server runs perfectly.
[09:36] <elros> i got in via virtual terminal 1 (ctrl-alt-f1)
[09:36] <patrick_king> stalefries: how do i do that then
[09:36] <elros> but gdm is no-go
[09:36] <elros> it just logs me out again :-/
[09:36] <quik_> You'll need perl regex library for lighttpd
[09:36] <mordify> hey guys
[09:36] <quik_> I used this script http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/browser/trunk/debian/init.d
[09:36] <macsim> ahah
[09:36] <mordify> sdf
[09:36] <stalefries> patrick_king: depends on what terminal program you use. in Gnome-terminal, you set it in the preferences
[09:36] <LjL> quik_: it will be installed automatically since i'm not installed from source
[09:37] <patrick_king> at the moment im using putty for windows
[09:37] <AfterDeath> O.o
[09:37] <mordify> hey guys
[09:37] <LjL> quik_: my problem was simply that i had apache running
[09:37] <stalefries> !hi | mordify
[09:37] <ubotu> mordify: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:37] <cmweb> Ok i have always trusted no-ip.com but their script may be corupt. Can some take a look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33339/ and tell me the problem
[09:38] <mordify> could someone help me? I want to set permissions on a drive??
[09:38] <sn9> i upgraded breezy to dapper on powerpc, and now firefox does a SIGILL. any ideas?
[09:38] <LjL> quik_: now the init.d script works fine here. why can't you just install lighttpd from the repositories?
[09:38] <quik_> LjL: I can I guess.. lighttpd can just be strange to get right in the past
[09:39] <liri> is it possible to remove powernowd without removing ubuntu-desktop?
[09:39] <LjL> cmweb: are you sure you really executed the command "mv /tmp/no-ip2.conf /usr/local/etc/no-ip2.conf" ? it doesn't seem like it was executed
[09:39] <cmweb>  ljl, i didnt exicute it the program did
[09:39] <quik_> LjL: Whats the best way to remove a source build of something to replace it with a package?
[09:39] <murgi> hi
[09:40] <mordify> hi murgi
[09:40] <LjL> quik_: well, by installing it from the repos, it seems to work fine here, the init.d script works and i get to a welcome page if i type http://localhost
[09:40] <murgi> hi mordify
[09:40] <LjL> quik_: "make uninstall" from the source directory, if the Makefile supports that
[09:40] <patrick_king> well im of every one
[09:40] <stalefries> !hi | murgi
[09:40] <ubotu> murgi: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[09:40] <mordify> murgi how r u
[09:40] <LjL> quik_: you could also consider using checkinstall when installing stuff compiled from source (too late now though)
[09:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell quik_ about checkinstall | quik_, you have a private message from Ubotu
[09:41] <LjL> cmweb: well, try typing it manually now
[09:41] <quik_> LjL: good suggestion with checkinstalll
[09:41] <stalefries> mordify, murgi, if you're going to chat it up. please use /msg
[09:42] <mordify> cool
[09:42] <mwe> liri: how about just not running it? and removing it with apt-get might remove the meta package but it should remove any other actual packages
[09:42] <murgi> solo entiendo espaol
[09:42] <mordify>  but just wanting some advise
[09:42] <kryptix> hi
[09:42] <K1765> What will play dvd's on ubuntu?

[09:42] <cmweb> ljl, well the script didnt even make the darn (thats d a r n ) file its the package from no-ip.com i didnt install it from the repositories because it fauled up when i did
[09:42] <murgi> tanks
[09:42] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell K1765 about dvd | K1765, you have a private message from Ubotu
[09:42] <quik_> LjL: No rule to uninstall
[09:43] <liri> mwe: i stopped it but would like to remove it in the future and its promoting to remove ubuntu-desktop as well...
[09:43] <cmweb> ljl, wait a miute why is that your problem
[09:43] <LjL> quik_: you sure you're typing it from the source directory? i.e. the directory where the Makefile resides?
[09:43] <murgi> join #kubuntu-es
[09:43] <cmweb> ljl, brb
[09:43] <cyber_brain_mfkg> someone?
[09:43] <quik_> yes, I'm sure.
[09:43] <kryptix> i'm trying to run ubuntu 6.10 on ms virtual mashine. but i am not able to install ubuntu, because colours and the size of the screen are completely wrong. no way! even vga=771 won't work. what could be the problem?!
[09:43] <LjL> cmweb: ?
[09:44] <cmweb> ljl, lol dont worry about it
[09:44] <ashika> Anyone need anything
[09:44] <mordify> could someone help me? I want to set permissions on a drive??
[09:44] <mwe> liri: ubuntu-desktop is a meta package. removing it should be ok. just make sure it doesn't remove the packages it provides (with apt-get it shouldn't)
[09:44] <liri> mwe: ok thanks.
[09:44] <VigoFusion> krptix:ATI 200 series onboard?
[09:44] <LjL> quik_: then tough luck... well, try using checkinstall now. run a "sudo checkinstall" (has the same effect of "sudo make install", except it uses checkinstall)
[09:44] <kryptix> ati x300
[09:45] <mordify> *mwe* could you help me? I want to set permissions on a drive??
[09:45] <LjL> quik_: do NOT interrupt it for any reason, and when it's finished installing, you should hopefully be able to uninstall. though i'm not entirely sure, since the files are already there by now
[09:45] <kryptix> using a dell inspiron 9300
[09:45] <kryptix> and i'm not a unix beginner
[09:45] <mwe> mordify: maybe. you probably need to mount it differently
[09:46] <vali> hi can someone help me to install a player that support mp3 files on a ubuntu 5.04 machine
[09:46] <kryptix> but even setup is not working correctly, thats why i am here :)
[09:46] <cmweb> If any one has tryed and has a successful install from the no-ip client please look at this and tell me whats wrong http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33340/
[09:46] <mwe> mordify: what file system is it and how is it mounted? and what perms do you want?
[09:46] <quik_> check install returns make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
[09:46] <mordify> *mwe* it mounts automatically but dont know aht command to use with sudo
[09:46] <VigoFusion> kryptix: I am a linux noob, but here is a thing, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934  talks about fglrx and stuff
[09:47] <LjL> quik_, wait a minute, you *did* use "make install" when first installing lighttpd, didn't you?
[09:47] <mwe> mordify: you should change fstab. paste it on pastebin and tell me what permissions you want
[09:47] <quik_> LjL: ahh yeah?
[09:47] <mordify> *mwe* ?????
[09:47] <telmich> ahoi
[09:47] <LjL> quik_: "yeah?" as in "yes, i did"? =)
[09:48] <quik_> I did. not in this directory though
[09:48] <mwe> mordify: use paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste the contents of the /etc/fstab file
[09:48] <quik_> I guess I have to rebuild it?
[09:48] <telmich> what may be broken, if the tvcard (hauppage) sometimes does not oplay sound?
[09:48] <mwe> mordify: then tell me what permissions you want
[09:48] <blekos> hi guys
[09:48] <mordify> *mwe* will do
[09:48] <LjL> quik_: probably. you need to be in the directory where you built it
[09:48] <telmich> i am using xawtv currenlty
[09:48] <blekos> anyone running a core 2 duo?
[09:48] <LjL> quik_: that is, the directory that you can run "./configure" from
[09:49] <kryptix> VigoFusion: yes. thx, but to fix the problem, written in the forum, ubuntu has already to be insalled. i cant do that, using the gui, because the graphiccard is not set up correctly

[10:05] <Seveas> cmwe1, not with this trick (and no, I won't eplain the trick)
[10:05] <cmwe1> stalefries, cant tell?
[10:05] <pluma> Is there a way to change what Konqueror, Xchat etc recognise as the default browser? I de-installed the Firefox package to install Firefox 2.0 manually and now I'm stuck with Lynx because Firefox' "Check for default browser" button doesn't seem to do jack.
[10:05] <stalefries> cmwe1: nope :(
[10:05] <mordify> *mwe* what is that
[10:05] <Seveas> Dybber, use your chanserv password as server password
[10:05] <mwe> !tell mordify about ntfs-3g | mordify you have a private message from ubotu
[10:05] <kudzubane> Dybber: you need to register your nick with freenode
[10:05] <cmwe1> stalefries, webhosting
[10:05] <stalefries> cmwe1: well, duh
[10:06] <emilia> anyone know how to make a program run full screen without a close button? i want a user to log in, and have that program run automatically full screenwith no close button, and no taskbars(which i will remove)
[10:06] <cmwe1> seveas, i understandd
[10:06] <Sp4rKy> pleasse
[10:06] <sizzam> Dybber: highlight the network in the Network list and click Edit, there's a place for Nickserv password in there
[10:06] <Dybber> Seveas, thats what I have done
[10:06] <stalefries> cmwe1: wait, you want to host other?
[10:06] <cmwe1> stalefries, what do you want the technicals?
[10:06] <cmwe1> stalefries, yes
[10:06] <mordify> *mwe* thanx would that work for fat as well
[10:06] <blekos> Seveas, perhaps u have an idea for running only with one core
[10:06] <dafan> I have a question, is it possible to login to root via the login screen rather than the terminal?
[10:06] <stalefries> cmwe1: no, just figured it was some personal site
[10:06] <mwe> mordify: you can write to fat safely already
[10:06] <Dybber> sizzam, ohh thanks :)
[10:07] <cmwe1> stalefries, im going g4 in may

[10:07] <Dybber> sizzam, I used the server-password field

[10:07] <mwe> mordify: provided it's mounted correctly
[10:07] <kudzubane> Dybber: then add the nickserv password to the nickserv password field under irc server config diaglog
[10:07] <stalefries> VigoFusion: http://cmweb.zapto.org
[10:07] <mordify> *mwe* is there a safe way to change ntfs to fat
[10:07] <VigoFusion> Neeters
[10:07] <stalefries> mordify: no
[10:07] <mwe> mordify: I don't think so. only way I know is backup an reformat
[10:07] <VigoFusion> :)
[10:07] <cmwe1> g4 = four gigabites a sec
[10:08] <stalefries> mwe is right

[10:08] <stalefries> cmwe1: gah
[10:08] <mwe> mordify: installing ntfs-3g is not that hard
[10:08] <cmwe1> stalefries, ?
[10:08] <mordify> *mwe* thank you very much
[10:09] <stalefries> cmwe1: so much
[10:09] <cmwe1> stalefries, lot of info?
[10:09] <mordify> *mwe* one last thing i have a usb drv but it wont let me write to it either but not sure if it is ntfs

[10:09] <Stormx2> Offtopic question because I know there are programmers here. My school runs a computing course for sixth form, teaches Pascal as the programming language. Now I've always thought that pascal is a pretty old/useless language. The school has like, Delphi pascal or something like that, made by M$. We can do projects, etc, in any language we like. I was wondering if its worth buying a laptop and using that in school, and learn C or some
[10:09] <Stormx2> thing. Any suggestions?

[10:12] <Stormx2> devilsadvocate, in the UK we have sixth form. After 10 or so years of compuslary education you can drop out at age 16, or do college / sixth form (basicly the same thing). You do A-Levels there.

[10:17] <Mythbusters> pluma http://xchat.org/faq/#q221
[10:17] <pluma> Mythbusters, that's Xchat, not Kopete.
[10:17] <MuPp3t> I'm pretty sure it's something blatantly obvious, but I can't figure out how to get it to work..
[10:17] <mooey> pluma, i'm not sure about kopete. for xchat at least, you need to look into update-alternatives command line tool

[10:50] <javaJake> No
[10:50] <olds> hmmm, I'm not sure
[10:50] <mat1> stalefries: 6thnx any ways atleast it works:)
[10:51] <stalefries> mat1: your welcome
[10:51] <olds> you could run a cron script
[10:51] <javaJake> cron...?
[10:51] <olds> that checks every 20 seconds or something
[10:51] <stalefries> !cron
[10:51] <ubotu> cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto  -  There is also a decent Howto at http://www.tech-geeks.org/contrib/mdrone/cron&crontab-howto.htm

[10:51] <olds> err, cron a script
[10:51] <javaJake> No no
[10:51] <olds> but that's kinda ghetto
[10:51] <stalefries> ghetto indeed
[10:51] <javaJake> This script only needs to be run once, when a device is plugged in
[10:51] <skizm> he was saying the script should check to see if the device is plugged in
[10:52] <skizm> every 20 seconds
[10:52] <hazart> What is the news on the new showstopper bug in coreutils in feisty?
[10:52] <javaJake> skizm, Yea, but how would I have the script only execute _once_ for every time it is plugged in?
[10:52] <bonzai10> do i need all gsteamers from my repos ?
[10:52] <stalefries> javaJake: System>Preferences>Removable Drives and Media
[10:52] <stalefries> javaJake: then tell it to run programs on the media
[10:52] <olds> javaJake: you could do it, but it'd be dirty
[10:52] <olds> http://www.buberel.org/linux/usb-automounter.php
[10:53] <stalefries> javaJake: then put your script on the media
[10:53] <olds> that's more of what you want

[11:00] <Darok> bruenig, hey dude.. yeah I did and I uncheck to remove tabs, but it stays there
[11:00] <endersbean3k1> so then if i type, exactly as i have here, it should let me into the user administration, right? :     sudo users-admin                       But then i'm Command Line impared, so I could be missing something
[11:00] <LjL> javaJake: not really. it says you shouldn't shout, so just don't shout
[11:00] <Admiral_Buttercr> is there an ubuntu cannel for windows emulation?
[11:00] <Bilange> Darok, but sometimes (I dont know why/when) xchat ignores this setting and let the tabs at the left. I know its annoying, but I dont know the solution if it presists staying at the left :/
[11:00] <Darok> its on the left, and its checked to be on bottom, but its on the left

[11:07] <David> hi
[11:07] <funkygreendogs> thanks Ljl
[11:07] <kyawzin> I have downloaded Ubuntu 6.10
[11:07] <kyawzin> and tried installing
[11:07] <kyawzin> but
[11:07] <kyawzin> it stucks at 49%
[11:07] <bimberi> !enter
[11:07] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[11:08] <kyawzin> forever
[11:08] <David> I tried installing the server and it failed to detect my network cards
[11:08] <zOap> I uninstalled nautilus since I mainly use Worker, but now all my desktop icons are disappeared, and I can't add new ones.. I didn't know that nautilus was linked to the desktop, or maybe it's not? any ideas?
[11:08] <David> are SMC's not in the default kernel configuration?
[11:08] <dreamerhxc> how can I go back to graphic-mode from console mode?
[11:08] <LjL> dreamerhxc: ctrl+alt+f7, unless you closed down X
[11:08] <SilentDis> question:  anyone have any hints on fixing a general system instability?  at this point, I'm leaning toward BIOS settings, as it generally occurs in both Windows and Dapper.
[11:08] <SilentDis> system specs:  Via chipset on mobo, amd athlon xp 1900 proc, 1gb ram, nvidia gfx card
[11:08] <David> silentdis: acpi
[11:09] <SilentDis> David:  acpi?
[11:09] <LjL> SilentDis: perhaps you could have a hardware problem, no? tried running a memtest, or checking your hard drive?
[11:09] <David> oh...and the via chipset:P
[11:09] <SilentDis> LjL:  hard drive checks out fine, mem test runs without a hitch.
[11:09] <David> via chipsets are notiously....umm...you know
[11:09] <dreamerhxc> if i reconfigure xorg before installing ubuntu, do I have to reboot computer?
[11:09] <ryanakca> I ran dpkg --get-selections... it created the file "dpkgselections"... what do I do now with the file?
[11:09] <SilentDis> David:  I am apt to agree with you on the Via chipset comment :P
[11:09] <Admiral_Buttercr> anyone have experience with wine?
[11:10] <VigoFusion> SilentDis: I suspect hardware also, bad HDD or something if its occuring in to independant systems.

[11:11] <David> what chipset?
[11:11] <Admiral_Buttercr> i know its there b/c the terminal responds to the wine cmd
[11:11] <bimberi> dreamerhxc: ah, 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart' to restart X in Ubuntu
[11:11] <iwkse> Admiral_Buttercr: so, where's the problem?
[11:11] <dreamerhxc> oh thank u
[11:11] <Admiral_Buttercr> it wont work
[11:11] <dreamerhxc> im gonna try it
[11:12] <SilentDis> David:  i'd be happy to look it up if you can give me the command to do so.  can't remember precicely.  mobo is an Abit KR7A raid.
[11:12] <Admiral_Buttercr> it wont run .exe files and such
[11:12] <VigoFusion> SilentDis: Could very well be BIOS, default settings to test it?
[11:12] <iwkse> Admiral_Buttercr: how did you install wine?
[11:12] <bimberi> Admiral_Buttercr: 'wine /path/to/file.exe'
[11:12] <SilentDis> VigoFusion:  did the default settings thing, same issues.  random crashes/hangs.

[11:15] <Bilange> SilentDis, since everything was done software-wise and you still get crashes, try to look for the hardware (if there's any sign of [ab] uses)... I burned my KT400 (asus a7v8x) because the power supply failed to send proper voltages :/

[11:17] <David> normal?
[11:17] <Soccrmastr> guys, whats lighter Xfce or IceWM?
[11:17] <Bilange> my KT400 had a bug at 333 mhz, I had to clock down to 266 (but memtest reported me errors at 333)
[11:17] <SilentDis> Bilange:  drop it to 100mhz instead of it's blazing 133?  :P
[11:17] <Soccrmastr> or is there anything lighter than that but still nice-lookign and eays to use?
[11:17] <Bilange> SilentDis, i know... :( but im out of ideas here too :S
[11:17] <elkbuntu> jvai, this isnt a social channel, head to #ubuntu-offtopic for non-support chatter :)
[11:17] <rogue780> Why is it that when I start a download it is always super fast, but continuously becomes slower until it plateaus?
[11:18] <bimberi> Soccrmastr: i think fluxbox is lighter than those (not certain though)
[11:18] <stephans> how do I replace the libc6 with ubuntus version.....
[11:18] <Soccrmastr> rogue780: might be an ISP issue?
[11:18] <The_Belgain> quick question: i'm seeing hard locks in edgy using the generic version of the kernel (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=296031).  a couple of people have suggested that changing from the generic kernel to the i386 kernel fixes this
[11:18] <stephans> some app upgrade installed a new one...
[11:18] <The_Belgain> how can i do this?
[11:18] <Soccrmastr> bimberi: ok thanks ill check it out
[11:18] <SilentDis> Bilange:  yeah, i am too.  i do have one concern... was just looking through my syslog, seems to be hitting apic errors rather frequently.  i know that's disabled in bios...  any way to get ubuntu to stop trying to use it?
[11:18] <rogue780> it's always been like that. even since the days of pay by the minute dialup.
[11:18] <jvai> elkbuntu.. when i typed that.. i did it as a observer.. hence (class)

[11:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubotufoo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:19] <stephans> What is the package anyhow...?
[11:19] <rogue780> not a problem really, more curiosity than anything
[11:19] <Bilange> SilentDis, try to remove it from the startup... ill get the howto in a sec..
[11:19] <bimberi> Soccrmastr: http://fluxbuntu.org/
[11:19] <LjL> cmweb: in the directory you ran supybot-wizard from i think, probably your home directory
[11:19] <SilentDis> Bilange:  thanks :)
[11:19] <cmweb> ljl, nope
[11:19] <rogue780> it starts out at nearly 2mbps and then stablizes at 800kbs
[11:19] <rogue780> ish
[11:19] <stephans> when I try to remove it synaptic wants to remove nearly the whole system...
[11:19] <dreamerhxc> ohoh!!!
[11:19] <Soccrmastr> bimberi: im on their sourceforge site thx though ill check both out... IceWm still looks lighter
[11:19] <bimberi> stephans: why remove synaptic?
[11:19] <dreamerhxc> i got something!!!

[11:20] <stephans> I want ubuntus version
[11:20] <LjL> cmweb, then just type "find ~ -iname cmweb-admin.conf

[11:20] <bimberi> stephans: ah, misread.
[11:20] <kyawzin> is it possible to install GNOME on the Ubuntu Server from Ubuntu desktop 6.10 CD?
[11:20] <SilentDis> Bilange:  checking it out now, thanks :)
[11:20] <stephans> bimberu: I need to compile something... and it will not work...
[11:21] <Bilange> no probs :)
[11:21] <docgnome> I'm running a dhcp3 server on my local network. It also acts as a gateway between my local network and my dial-up internet connection. When I connect to my ISP they, naturally, send me dns server addresses. Right now the dhcp server isn't passing those along to the clients. Does anyone know how to set that up?
[11:21] <bimberi> stephans: try this: ensure you only have ubuntu repos in sources.list, 'sudo apt-get update' then 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6'
[11:21] <LjL> kyawzin: should be. insert the CD, and type "sudo apt-cdrom add"
[11:21] <Kijutsu> Is sonypi and spicctrl available for use with Kubuntu? These are for sony vaio laptops mainly.
[11:21] <rogue780> kyawzin, you should be able to run apt-get install ubuntu-desktop from the command line on the server
[11:21] <stephans> ok
[11:21] <kyawzin> LjL, Thanks!
[11:21] <rogue780> !ubuntu-desktop
[11:21] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[11:21] <Soccrmastr> what is the diffrence between a window manager, and a desktop environment. arent they the same thing?
[11:22] <stephans> bimberi: Reinstallation of libc6 is not possible, it cannot be downloaded.
[11:22] <rogue780> Soccrmastr, nes and yo...
[11:22] <apokryphos> Soccrmastr: not exactly. A window manager only specifically handles things like/including window manipulations, placements, and such things
[11:22] <stalefries> Soccrmastr: window manager just manages windows, desktop environment is oh so much more
[11:22] <stephans> It can not find the matching version...
[11:22] <stephans> bimberi: It can not find the matching version...
[11:22] <SilentDis> gonna drop out and follow that list.  Thanks again bilange, it's a start at least :)

[11:25] <dyzlex> LjL: yeah, but it wont be text is the problem.
[11:25] <LjL> uksprout: it doesn't, without proprietary drivers. such drivers are shipped, however.
[11:25] <LjL> dyzlex: well, you said you're doing it in photoshop
[11:25] <dyzlex> LjL: Yeah, but then I cant change the font colour, size, or font.
[11:26] <LjL> dyzlex: anyway try typing /who #channelname then
[11:26] <uksprout> so I can d/l drivers for full support of the card then
[11:26] <dyzlex> LjL: Thanks
[11:26] <LjL> uksprout: no need to download them manually, you can get them automatically from the repositories.
[11:26] <The_Belgain> so no ideas on how to change which version of the kernel i'm using on edgy (i.e. changing from the "generic" to the "i386" version)?

[11:28] <bimberi> stephans: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-200393.html gives a clue - request installation of a specific version - find out what that is using 'apt-cache policy libc6' then 'sudo apt-get install libc6=<version>'
[11:28] <graham> i have tried evrything to get my wireless network card working but nothing works how do i install the drivers from a windows instalation disk
[11:28] <The_Belgain> uboto: i'm not trying to get better performance here - it's just that the generic kernel hard locks, and there have been posts suggesting that the i386 one doesn't...
[11:29] <skizm> if i'm manually creating a conf file where should i put it so i can run an app from the command line
[11:29] <apokryphos> ubotu: tell The_Belgain about bot
[11:29] <The_Belgain> are you saying there are no longer any architecture-specific kernels in ubuntu any more?

[11:37] <imme-emosol> among others
[11:37] <imme-emosol> Can anyone tell me how to solve this?
[11:38] <bimberi> imme-emosol: any non-ubuntu repositories in your sources.list?

[11:39] <imme-emosol> bimberi, compiz, beryl and wine.    Okay, thanks.
[11:39] <confusco> anybody have an idea why my game is slow? I've installed the drivers correctly, and have direct rendering, but it's a lot slower than in Windows
[11:39] <ubuntu> como
[11:39] <pradalover> Has anyone here every installed mysql, php and apache using synaptic?
[11:39] <bimberi> imme-emosol: ah those, they seem quite popular :)
[11:39] <LjL> ubuntu: /join #ubuntu-se
[11:39] <LjL> err, /join #ubuntu-es
[11:39] <bimberi> !lamp | pradalover
[11:39] <ubotu> pradalover: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[11:40] <ublender> confusco: I have noticed the same problem, and I have never figured out why
[11:40] <pradalover> oops...I meant ever
[11:40] <mc44> LjL: imagining the hilarious spanish / swedish conversations they have going on now :)
[11:40] <imme-emosol> bimberi, Yes, I want to see what all that beryl - stuff is about.
[11:40] <stalefries> ubuntu: para hablar con otros ubuntueros, escribe '/join #ubuntu-es'
[11:40] <Bilange> hehe mc44
[11:40] <stalefries> bah, too late
[11:40] <LjL> mc44: unfortunately, me too =\
[11:40] <Flats> I have a laptop that I am dual booting with XP and Ubuntu. It's using the Ubuntu Grub I believe as the boot loader. I want to remove the Ubuntu and the bootloader ( I have another PC with it. ) Whats the best way to do it?
[11:40] <imme-emosol> bimberi, And wine, well, let's just say that there are people out there that seem to use IE6 or something and I develop sites sometimes... So... :S
[11:40] <bimberi> imme-emosol: fair enough too, it's pretty cool
[11:41] <willow> please help me, i can't boot, because of an "error 21" and my grub
[11:41] <bimberi> imme-emosol: xgl/beryl that is, not IE6 ;p
[11:41] <stalefries> willow: try googling for "error 21 grub" online
[11:41] <imme-emosol> bimberi, ghehe... Gotcha... :D
[11:41] <willow> i've aldready done it
[11:41] <katerine> Why do I still have this message : 'FATAL you need to install the Kernel Source for your running kernel' when installing the drivers or my webcam ?
[11:41] <mc44> willow: you need to set up the disk in your BIOS
[11:42] <snype> willow-- whats your problem?
[11:42] <skizm> how can i easily rename my computer in ubuntu?  i seemingly have absentmindedly named both my computers the same thing ;p
[11:42] <bimberi> katerine: 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)'
[11:42] <willow> yes, but i don't know how to set up my BIOS
[11:42] <imme-emosol> bimberi, But your solution fixed the problem, thanks.
[11:42] <bimberi> imme-emosol: np :)
[11:42] <pradalover> of someone helped me install , how could I tell if it was installed properly?
[11:42] <willow> snype: when i turn on my computer, i dont have grub, but an error 21 (on stage 1.5)
[11:42] <pradalover> forgive me I new
[11:42] <pradalover> ay all
[11:42] <pradalover> at
[11:43] <mc44> willow:  when you reboot press delete (usually) and it should go into bios
[11:43] <snype> yeah exactly
[11:43] <iwkse> katerine: do you have linux drivers for your webcam?
[11:43] <stalefries> willow: or F1 or F2 or something
[11:43] <snype> ^^^ do what mc44 said
[11:43] <Flats> ACtually I guess I just need to uninstall the grub loader. I can just format the linux partitions but don't know the proper way to uninstall the bootloader so that just windows will boot
[11:43] <snype> willow- could be enter too
[11:43] <willow> i know how to go to the bios
[11:43] <katerine> iwkse: yes I do
[11:43] <snype> willow-- best bet press every button at once
[11:43] <willow> but don't know what and how configure it
[11:43] <stalefries> snype: lol
[11:43] <willow> lol
[11:43] <katerine> bimberi: it works! thanks...
[11:44] <^_^Chris> hi
=== ^_^Chris is now known as FFForever
[11:44] <snype> stalefriew-- well i dont see a down side to it
[11:44] <willow> my motherboard is an asus P5B
[11:44] <FFForever> hi
[11:44] <mc44> willow: ok when your in the BIOS there should be a place where hard disks are set up
[11:44] <snype> willow: what options do u have in ur bios?
[11:44] <ToHellWithGA> how can i type unicode characters using my keyboard, like b5 for micro?
[11:44] <cmweb> ljl, i downloaded a plugin how do i install it
[11:44] <FFForever> can i have gnome and kde?
[11:44] <snype> yes
[11:44] <bimberi> katerine: yw :)
[11:44] <FFForever> how?
[11:44] <snype> if u have ubuntu installed just type
[11:44] <grimboy> Hey is it possible that anyone here could do me a favour and tell me if you can display the xcf fonts here > http://www.proggyfonts.com/index.php?menu=download I can't and I want to know if it's just me.
[11:44] <FFForever> no im about to download it
[11:44] <snype> "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop"
[11:45] <FFForever> im downloading kubuntu atm, how do i install gnome?
[11:45] <mc44> willow: then just make sure primary master, primary slave etc are set to AUTO and it should find you hard disks
[11:45] <willow> the set up are for the sata devices
[11:45] <willow> but i've none
[11:45] <snype> FForever type:
[11:45] <Bilange> then its ubuntu-desktop (if i remember correctly(
[11:45] <snype> "sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop"
[11:45] <willow> my HDD is IDE
[11:45] <FFForever> how can i reenable the root login?
[11:45] <Bilange> !root
[11:45] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:45] <Bilange> oops, not this one...
[11:45] <snype> i think u can just try
[11:46] <mc44> willow: can you change the option to auto, or IDE?
[11:46] <azcazandco> hey folks
[11:46] <snype> sudo passwd root
[11:46] <snype> that should work
[11:46] <FFForever> lol
[11:46] <Vich> how do I remove a wifi driver so my ubuntu won't freeze at startup?
[11:46] <snype> but i wouldnt do it personally
[11:46] <FFForever> i know that :)
[11:46] <Vich> because the driver is bad
[11:46] <azcazandco> is there any way to format a drive as ntfs using gparted?
[11:46] <FFForever> i was refering how do i change the root login so i can login as root
[11:46] <Bilange> FFForever, actually you can get access to root by typing "sudo -i", and it will give you a root prompt... rather more safe than actually enabling root account
[11:46] <mc44> !sudo | FFForever
[11:46] <ubotu> FFForever: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:46] <willow> mc44:  i don't remember well
[11:46] <Vich> the only way I can boot up now, is to remove said card
[11:46] <grimboy> FFForever, snype just said.
[11:46] <azcazandco> I am trying to prep a drive to install win2k because I just got a 21' crt gaming monitor and I wanna play some of my old games
[11:46] <FFForever> when i get to gdm i want to login as "root"
[11:47] <Vich> azcazandco, I think you can just make a partition and choose ntfs
[11:47] <snype> Vich you might try checking /etc/modules
[11:47] <grimboy> FFForever, Although it's a bad idea.
[11:47] <snype> make sure it isnt listed in there
[11:47] <cmweb> ljl, do you know how the bot works?
[11:47] <azcazandco> Vich: it wont let me, it is blanked out
[11:47] <Vich> thanks snoogie
[11:47] <K^Holtz> how come my edgy only has 2 workspaces? breezy had 4 and my friends edgy has 4
[11:47] <Vich> what is?
[11:47] <snype> snoogie?
[11:47] <Vich> ntfs?
[11:47] <azcazandco> yeah
[11:47] <grimboy> FFForever, I'm not here to judge you though.
[11:47] <tritium> K^Holtz: you can change it easily in the applet's preferences
[11:47] <LjL> cmweb, you put plugins in the plugins/ directory. and the other one is a bit of a generic question
[11:47] <Vich> azcazandco, try making the partition
[11:47] <Vich> but not formatting it
[11:47] <FFForever> i know to change the pass but yeah there are times where its just easyer to login as root
[11:47] <Vich> then when you boot off the win2k disc
[11:47] <cmweb> the folder or the files
[11:47] <K^Holtz> tritium: thanks
[11:47] <Vich> choose that partition
[11:47] <LjL> cmweb: the folder
[11:47] <Vich> and it should format it to ntfs
[11:48] <stalefries> azcazandco: if you pop the drive into a windows machine, you can have windows format it
[11:48] <FFForever> (at the login screen)
[11:48] <cmweb> i got Greet and Webopedia in and it wont do the command
[11:48] <Vich> you don't even have to pop it into a windows machine
[11:48] <stalefries> but you probably want to do it thsi way :)
[11:48] <snype> azcazandco you could play the games in linux with cedega
[11:48] <azcazandco> Vich: if I install win 2k then install dapper to another sata drivce afterwards I should get a grub loader for both huh?
[11:48] <uksprout> LjL: a l;ittle background... I'm using mepis 6.0 atm and only installed it two weeks ago I have spent virtually all my spare time since then trying to get video playback on my tv is this likely to be the case with ubuntu?
[11:48] <Vich> yeah
[11:48] <Vich> as long as you have grub on the mbr
[11:48] <uksprout> and if not where can I d/l it?
[11:49] <azcazandco> snype: I need to buy that though don't i?
[11:49] <LjL> cmweb, restart the bot
[11:49] <snype> you should
[11:49] <friedtofu> how do you change your resolution? (there are only four options 1280x1024, 1024x768, 800x600, 640x480 - i want 1440x900 - i am using Intel 82915G/GV/910GL and it does recognize it but doesnt list the resolutions... can anyone tell me how to change it?
[11:49] <Vich> i.e. as long as the ubuntu drive is the first bootable hard drive (set in bios)
[11:49] <snype> but i've heard of ppl finding it on thepiratebay
[11:49] <azcazandco> snype: I am kind of broke at the moment
[11:49] <cmweb> k
[11:49] <LjL> uksprout: got no idea, i don't have tv-out
[11:49] <snype> yeah-- i used wine to get my cs:source working
[11:49] <stalefries> snype: it's out there all right :)
[11:49] <LjL> cmweb: then type %load pluginname
[11:49] <jramsey> anyone know why if i have sun-java5-bin installed, pogo games whines about "Java Not Found or Not Working"
[11:49] <Vich> friedtofu, I achieved this by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:49] <stalefries> jramsey: you need the plugin too
[11:50] <snype> then i was in a bay full of pirates and they forced me to try cedega--- i'll never go back
[11:50] <Vich> simply remove the options that are in the wrong ratio
[11:50] <mjr> friedtofu, afaik intel can only use modes that the bios knows; you can try to tune that with 915resolution, I think (install the package)
[11:50] <azcazandco> Vich: I currently have a semi fried install of dapper so I want to try and migrate to a new install of it
[11:50] <uksprout> !help
[11:50] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[11:50] <jramsey> i thought the sun-java5-bin got all??
[11:50] <friedtofu> ah..
[11:50] <Vich> and add the correct ratio
[11:50] <stalefries> jramsey: dunno what it's called, but you can try 'apt-cache search java plugin'
[11:50] <der0b> friedtofu: I think I did that by sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[11:50] <jramsey> ok will try txs
[11:50] <azcazandco> figured I could go with a dual boot for gaming seeing as I have a Tb of storeage
[11:50] <Vich> I have dual boot winxp/ubuntu edgy
[11:50] <cmweb> lljl, can you elaborate. Where at
[11:50] <snype> yeah you could do that w/ 20gbs
[11:51] <Vich> and yeah
[11:51] <snype> but dont u want to not have m$ bs
[11:51] <grimboy> azcazandco, Shakes fist.
[11:51] <LjL> cmweb: in a query with the bot
[11:51] <grimboy> I mean
[11:51] <azcazandco> grimboy: ?
[11:51] <snype> i hate dual boot personally
[11:51] <LjL> cmweb, there is a #supybot channel by the way
[11:51] <azcazandco> me too
[11:51] <cmweb> you serious
[11:51] <cmweb> figs
[11:51] <azcazandco> have avoided it like the plague
[11:51] <friedtofu> der0b: on the one of the screen it freezes up -.-
[11:51] <snype> yup
[11:52] <snype> whenever i have dual boot i just use one
[11:52] <azcazandco> didnt really think about cedega
[11:52] <LjL> cmweb: no, i said it just to give my fingers some movement
[11:52] <snype> :-D that's what i'm here for
[11:52] <grimboy> azcazandco, Don't, honestly, it's not very good - just good enough for some.
[11:52] <azcazandco> I was using parallels but I have fried something in dapper and want a clean install to redo all ym settings etc
[11:52] <snype> i'd attempt to use cedega before i used windows
[11:52] <azcazandco> grimboy: dotn use cedega?
[11:53] <snype> cedega runs CS:Source wonderfully
[11:53] <grimboy> azcazandco, You can, but I think you'll be disapointed for some games.
[11:53] <shadeofgrey> is anybody in here very knowledgable about the US government and the US constitution?  im trying to create a blog post and i need to fiond the transcript of the oath the US president has to take before he assumes office -- usually followed immediately by his/her inauguration address
[11:53] <azcazandco> grimboy: what would you suggest?
[11:53] <gnomefreak> shadeofgrey: not in here
[11:53] <grimboy> azcazandco, Dual boot.
[11:53] <azcazandco> I wanna try out the combat elite mod of enemy territory
[11:54] <der0b> friedtofu: are you running it from a terminal?
[11:54] <azcazandco> if I could find just one good game I would be happy
[11:54] <shadeofgrey> and can anybody please point me to written instructions as to how i might go about turning my 2.0ghz macbookpro into a tiger/ubuntu dualboot workstation?
[11:54] <grimboy> I don't really get what people have against it.
[11:54] <stalefries> azcazandco: like frozen bubble? :)
[11:54] <azcazandco> ?
[11:54] <grimboy> Or tremulous
[11:54] <friedtofu> der0b: yeah, it freezes on the PCI port reading
[11:54] <stalefries> ooh, yeah, trem rocks
[11:54] <gnomefreak> !dualboot

[11:55] <azcazandco> tremulous looked good but I fried my dapper install before I got into it
[11:55] <cmweb> ljl, theis no one alive in their and well nvm
[11:55] <grimboy> It's slowwww.... on my laptop though. And if I try to make the resolution smaller it gets all centred.
[11:55] <rellis> L O L
[11:55] <jramsey> sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin fails; maybe there's another pkg name??
[11:55] <shadeofgrey> oh im  sorry -- i meant a dual boot system on  an intel mac not a ppc
[11:55] <azcazandco> anyone played combat elite?
[11:55] <gnomefreak> jramsey: enable the multiverse repo
[11:55] <stalefries> jramsey: how does it fail?
[11:55] <rellis> Ubuntu Server has the file iftab present without having udev installed...
[11:55] <grimboy> azcazandco, Is that a mod for something.
[11:55] <grimboy> ?
[11:55] <azcazandco> yeah
[11:55] <mick_> is libc6 2.4-1 only available in edgy?
[11:55] <azcazandco> looks wicked
[11:55] <rellis> What a god damn joke.
[11:55] <rogue780> anyone know an easy way to install ivtv drivers?
[11:55] <rogue780> for hauppauge pvr 150
[11:56] <azcazandco> never managed to get it running though
[11:56] <grimboy> azcazandco, I think so. It's quite good IIRC.
[11:56] <gnomefreak> mick_: dont mix libc packages
[11:56] <snype> acazandco ill be serious windows>cedega for gaming
[11:56] <snype> but if u're not hardcore than it'll be fine
[11:56] <azcazandco> I know I have borked my now edgy install
[11:56] <gnomefreak> mick_: fastest way to screw your pc up
[11:56] <jramsey> says it's unavailable but is referred to by another pkg; tryed synaptic pkg mgr but no plugin; gnomefreak how is multiverse enabled ??
[11:56] <mick_> gnomefreak, that is what i am asking, is 2.4-1 an edgy thing?

[11:58] <stalefries> kud0s|away: what do you want to know anbout window managers?
[11:58] <luca> when I try to, it does return error
[11:58] <mick_> have they fixed the black screen ati install yet?
[11:58] <mick_> for 6.10?
[11:58] <azcazandco> this was my 2nd install of dapper
[11:58] <luca> rogue780: have you checked the wikis?
[11:58] <azcazandco> 2nd ever linux install
[11:58] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: im thinking its the core of the problem
[11:58] <azcazandco> I kinda went nuts messing with it and killed it in the process
[11:58] <azcazandco> me too which is why I wanna go back toa  fresh install of dapper
[11:58] <rogue780> luca,  yes. so far the instructions they give haven't worked out right
[11:58] <Beta_M> teledyn:  /etc/fstab, remove the 'auto' part, i think it does that
[11:59] <kud0s|away> stalefries, i just want to get some information on them, how they are set up, how they work etc
=== kud0s|away is now known as kud0s
[11:59] <teledyn> Beta_M: auto is not set for the device in question
[11:59] <luca> rogue780: then I do not know sorry :(
[11:59] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: I dont know where to start finding what could be any number of things
[11:59] <stalefries> kud0s: ah
[11:59] <rogue780> luca, would it make a difference that I'm trying to install them on my kubuntu box?
[11:59] <kud0s> stalefries, do you have any lonks?
[11:59] <luca> I earnestly do not know
[11:59] <kud0s> *links
[11:59] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: it can only be a few things causing it and im leaning toward the unofficial packages
[11:59] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: ask in #ubuntu-xgl maybe they have seen the issue before
[12:00] <Kijutsu> So.  what's up with the i810 driver?  Does it not support XV at all?
[12:00] <stalefries> kud0s: no, sorry :(
[12:00] <gnomefreak> its either that or the theme your using (could be a few others but not likely)
[12:00] <mat1> i am using the stupid 1810
[12:00] <mat1> i810
