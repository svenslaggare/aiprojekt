[12:01] <lokki> if i run a check on the  disk it just says "clean"
[12:01] <linux_kid> dreamglider: good, now do you have cabextract
[12:01] <Dreamglider> how
[12:01] <graham_100_> kim^j i added it to paste bin
[12:01] <TonySoprano> thx for replying bimberi
[12:01] <lokki> i get an error on boot time that goes "fschk.ext3: unable to resolve UUID=blahbla-blahblah-5464g" and puts me in maintance mode?? Any help, tips, links??
[12:01] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Give me the URL to the pastebin then.
[12:01] <nikin> how can i check my cpu speed?
[12:01] <bimberi> TonySoprano: yw :)
[12:02] <poolkey172> nikin : cat /proc/cpuinfo
[12:02] <Kim^J> nikin: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[12:02] <TonySoprano> and linux_kid too
[12:02] <Kim^J> poolkey172: Pff... Your's wrong. ;)
[12:02] <graham_100_>  kim^j http://pastebin.ca/260023
[12:02] <poolkey172> lol : Everyone like the easy questions
[12:02] <nikin> ty
[12:02] <graham_100_> kim^j there is the url
[12:02] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: do you have cabextract?
[12:02] <graham_100_> kim^j
[12:02] <poolkey172> YES BABY BOOT
[12:02] <poolkey172> YES
[12:02] <poolkey172> aekjkkkbjcd
[12:03] <Kaptah> any grub guru's around ?
[12:03] <poolkey172> 213123189238979819873289 24 hours I have spent getting this to work
[12:03] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Ok. Seems fine. Now then give me the pastebin of: cd / && df -h
[12:03] <poolkey172> and now it does
[12:03] <poolkey172> holy crap this is fast
[12:03] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, now i do
[12:03] <Kim^J> Baahh... I have to get up in 5 hours and 30 minutes... :|
[12:03] <poolkey172> cyas all
[12:04] <Kim^J> Bye poolkey172
[12:04] <poolkey172> will post some benchmarks later
[12:04] <lokki> i get an error on boot time that goes "fschk.ext3: unable to resolve UUID=blahbla-blahblah-5464g" and puts me in maintance mode?? Any help, tips, links?? Thx
[12:04] <poolkey172> basically from what I see the kernel takes the most time loading ! ROFL
[12:04] <poolkey172> ciao

[12:04] <AshD> i set up Ubuntu W/S to kerberos+ldap auth against an OSX server - all works but to get audio etc i have to manually add users to certain local workstation groups... is there a way to nest groups or some other way i am unaware of... i do not want to have to manually add the network users to local groups
[12:04] <rambo3> lokki stop repeating
[12:04] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, no i have no idea how to use it

[12:05] <grout> I accidently deleted the task bar on the bottom, how can i bring it back?
[12:05] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, i have a EXE not a CAB file !
[12:05] <lokki> rambo3 what is the allowed frequency ? ;)
[12:05] <Kim^J> rambo3: Or just an excellent OS.
[12:06] <Chewy954> i need help with burning a iso image to cd
[12:06] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Seems fine there to.
[12:06] <linux_kid> dreamglider: yes, but cabextract also works with exe's (secretly...)
[12:06] <Chewy954> everytime i try to
[12:06] <Kim^J> Chewy954: Use K3B.
[12:06] <budluva> Chewy954, try k3b
[12:06] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, ok
[12:06] <rambo3> lokki try mounting parition with device name
[12:06] <graham_100_> kim^j so why can i not open it?
[12:06] <tuxedo_kamen> hi everyone
[12:06] <Chewy954> ive been told about it
[12:06] <grout> I accidently deleted the task bar on the bottom, how can i bring it back?
[12:06] <tuxedo_kamen> does anyone know how to disable the authomatic sound play in Firefox?
[12:06] <budluva> Chewy954, sudo apt-get install k3b
[12:06] <Chewy954> ok thxc
[12:06] <Kim^J> graham_100_: In Nautilus: Browse to /mnt
[12:06] <budluva> Chewy954, in a terminal
[12:06] <livingdaylight> !vmware
[12:06] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"). Instructions for VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[12:07] <lokki> rambo3 : it hits on boot time , so every time i boot i get an maintance mode
[12:07] <graham_100_> kim^j what is nautilus??
[12:07] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What DE are you using?
[12:07] <Spee_Der> !nautilis
[12:07] <budluva> graham_100_, its a file browser
[12:07] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nautilis - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:07] <Kim^J> !nautilus | graham_100_
[12:07] <ubotu> nautilus: file manager and graphical shell for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 586 kB, installed size 1424 kB
[12:07] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, ok files extracted
[12:08] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Xubuntu? What are you using?
[12:08] <grout> I accidently deleted the task bar on the bottom, how can i bring it back?
[12:08] <graham_100_> kim^j can't be bothered with this anymore too confusing for the simplest tasks
[12:08] <Kim^J> grout: Which DE?
[12:08] <grout> gnome
[12:08] <graham_100_> kim^j ubuntu
[12:08] <rambo3> lokki you are on bussybox , so you could try mounting system first if its not mounted , backup  fstab  and copy an old version that has been creating under install
[12:08] <graham_100_> kim^j 6.06lts
[12:08] <linux_kid> ok, good, now copy those files to somthing like /home/"you"/WLAN
[12:08] <grout> kim^j: gnome
[12:08] <nikin> i have p3 motherboard and i downscaled my prcessor from 600Mhz to 233 Mhz but cpuinfor still tells me that it is running at 600
[12:08] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What are you saying? You mean that you are to stupid to understand some of the most simplest things? All you have to do is follow what I say.
[12:09] <rambo3> lokki,  name of the file is : fstab.pre-uuid
[12:09] <lokki> rambo3 : got it thx very much
[12:09] <grout> kim^j: how can i get the task bar on the bottom back?
[12:09] <graham_100_> kim^j i have been following the things you have been telling me for ages and nothing works
[12:09] <Kim^J> grout: I saw the first time. ;) Try: gnome-panel in a shell.
[12:09] <livingdaylight> can someone tell me how vmware is used?
[12:10] <nikin> what is the information in /proc/cpuinfo based on
[12:10] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Open up Nautilus. Then browse yourself to /mnt
[12:10] <tuxedo_kamen> does anyone know how to disable the authomatic sound play in Firefox? >_<
[12:10] <Kim^J> Add the files you would like to have there. Done.
[12:10] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: good, now copy those file to somewhere like /home/[user] /WLAN
[12:10] <Kim^J> The harddrive IS working.
[12:10] <graham_100_> kim^j how the hell do i open nautilus??
[12:10] <nikin> or what program can i use to determine the CPU speed?
[12:10] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,
[12:10] <Kim^J> graham_100_: By using the startmenu?
[12:10] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,  done
[12:10] <rambo3> i would guess /dev/cpu or something
[12:10] <Kim^J> I don't know Gnome.
[12:10] <graham_100_> kim^j i have no start menu
[12:10] <Kim^J> nikin: What is that you are doing?
[12:11] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Huh?
[12:11] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Applications then?
[12:11] <iter> graham_100_: places --> computer
[12:11] <linux_kid> Dreamglider, good, now do you see any files ending in .inf or in .sys ?
[12:11] <Kim^J> iter: Ah thanks.
[12:11] <nikin> Kim: i want to get rid of the CPU fan
[12:11] <iter> graham_100_: then double click "file system" on the right
[12:11] <nikin> so i want to downscale the cpu
[12:11] <iter> graham_100_: err left that is
[12:11] <nikin> from 600 to 233 Mhz
[12:12] <Kim^J> nikin: That sound bad. Oh... Is it speedstep or AMD's thing?
[12:12] <iter> graham_100_: then double click on "mnt" in the main panel
[12:12] <nikin> so that it can work with just a heatsink
[12:12] <graham_100_> lost+found
[12:12] <Kim^J> nikin: Maybe you should read more about overclocking and just revert.
[12:12] <Kim^J> graham_100_: It's working then.
[12:12] <nikin> Kim: it is a P3 celeron 600
[12:12] <rambo3> nikin meby there is something in apt for cpu scaling
[12:12] <Kim^J> The drive is there.
[12:12] <lupine_85> powernowd ?
[12:13] <Kim^J> nikin: BIOS underclocking then.
[12:13] <nikin> rambo: can a p3 be scaled
[12:13] <nikin> ?
[12:13] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, No not from the extracted exe !
[12:13] <graham_100_> no that is my main drive i cant access my secondry drive
[12:13] <FFForever> root@LocalHost:~# glxinfo | grep direct, Error: unable to open display (null), how can i fix this?
[12:13] <graham_100_> *sigh*
[12:13] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: THATS HORRIBLE are there any on the cd?
[12:13] <nikin> Kim^J: can you suggest some text about that? i dont get the point what the problem is
[12:13] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What do you want? A D: drive? This is NOT Windows. It doesn't work that way.
[12:14] <nikin> Kim: i do bios underclocking
[12:14] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, cant i just use the fils on the Windows partion ?
[12:14] <iter> graham_100_: your main drive is /dev/hda1 mounted on /
[12:14] <graham_100_> kim^j well how does it work for a second hard drive then???
[12:14] <iter> graham_100_: your secondary drive is /dev/hdb1 mounted on /mnt
[12:14] <Kim^J> nikin: You do know what a BIOS is right? You can go into it and change the speed of the CPU.
[12:14] <iter> graham_100_: to use your 2nd drive just cd /mnt and start putting stuff there
[12:14] <livingdaylight>  can someone tell me how vmware is used?
[12:14] <Kim^J> OMG!!!
[12:14] <iter> graham_100_: if you want to put it somewhere other than /mnt it's possible
[12:14] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: is there one? Dont tell me the last 5 minutes have been wasted... my bad :P
[12:15] <graham_100_> when i go into computer it shows file system which is where the os is
[12:15] <rambo3> livingdaylight, -> #vmware
[12:15] <Chewy954> ok i got k3b
[12:15] <Chewy954> =D
[12:15] <nikin> Kim'J: i DID THAT
[12:15] <Kim^J> graham_100_: The drive is working. It's mounted on /mnt cause you said so.
[12:15] <graham_100_> and then the name of my second drive which i cannot access
[12:15] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,  tis ok
[12:15] <livingdaylight> rambo3, thx
[12:15] <lokki> livingdaylight: u boot the virtual machine and install the os u want in the virtuall machine
[12:15] <nikin> thats what i was doing from the begin
[12:15] <Kim^J> nikin: Oh. Then cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep speed
[12:15] <Kim^J> would give you an answer.
[12:15] <lokki> livingdaylight: u must install thew os
[12:15] <graham_100_> why cant all this be simpler?
[12:16] <iter> graham_100_: it's pretty simple, once you get the hang of it
[12:16] <nikin> there is no such : "speed"
[12:16] <nikin> i have cpu MHz
[12:16] <nikin> but that is still 600
[12:16] <iter> graham_100_: but it's different than what you're probably used to, so be prepared for a bit of a learning curve
[12:16] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What's you IQ? The drive is mounted. It's working. Just put your stuff in /mnt and it's on the drive.
[12:16] <graham_100_> iter how do i use my second drive then?? for word procesing ect
[12:16] <rambo3> graham_100_, i am not sure but maby gparted can do it autmaticly
[12:17] <graham_100_> the drive is not letting me put anything on it you fucking numb nuts
[12:17] <iter> graham_100_: well if you want to save to the second drive, when you go to "save" in your application
[12:17] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok, now go to the GTK thingy in the system->admininstration->windows drivers
[12:17] <ompaul> !language
[12:17] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:17] <iter> graham_100_: just save your stuff in /mnt/
[12:17] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: and say install new driver
[12:17] <livingdaylight> lokki, i've got vmwawre installed. Do i just launch it and then open my iso of choice?
[12:17] <lokki> graham_100 : is the drive read only?
[12:17] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, done
[12:17] <Kim^J> graham_100_: DO THIS: cd /mnt && touch hello
[12:17] <graham_100_> lokki i dont know
[12:17] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: locate the .inf file in your windows partition
[12:18] <Kim^J> graham_100_: And then: cd /mtn && ls -l
[12:18] <Kim^J> graham_100_: And then give me the output.
[12:18] <nikin> Kim^J: is that possible that the CPU owerlooks the bios settings about its speed?
[12:18] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, done
[12:18] <graham_100_> kim^j it tells me permission denied
[12:18] <gorski_> how to start a program using wine?
[12:18] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: then make sure it says "hardware present"...
[12:18] <rambo3> Kim^J, you could ask him if its fat or ntfs
[12:18] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, hardware present yes
[12:19] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What filesystem is on it?
[12:19] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: (sorry, we have to use terminal now) do a "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
[12:19] <graham_100_> kim^j i dont know?
[12:19] <lokki> livingdaylight: i have used it log ago not very sure but i think u just act like it is a fresh computer with no OS u must install os. Somewhere u have mapped a physical cd drive with a virtual one, put the os of ur choise on that cd
[12:19] <Kim^J> graham_100_: FAT? NTFS? ext3?
[12:19] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Did you format the drive?
[12:19] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Do you have anything on the drive?
[12:19] <graham_100_> kim^j how do i find out i did format it
[12:20] <graham_100_> kim^j it did have stuff on it before i id
[12:20] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, no output
[12:20] <iter> graham_100_: open a terminal, cd /mnt then do sudo touch test && ls
[12:20] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Check you memory. In your head. Remember things you did.
[12:20] <lokki> graham_100 do a df -h to see ur filesystem
[12:20] <Kim^J> lokki: Already done.

[12:21] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: is your so-called "wifi-light" on?
[12:21] <lokki> iter: didnt know this nice system for helping ;)
[12:21] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, where is this light ?
[12:21] <nikin> do you know a cpu test program that determines cpu speed by using the cpu?
[12:22] <graham_100_> kim^j so now what
[12:22] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Then do this: cd /mnt && sudo touch hello && ls /mnt
[12:22] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: on the card (if there is a light) there might not be one
[12:22] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, no it's not lit

[12:32] <Kim^J> lokki: He's kicked.
[12:32] <LjL> Kim^J, lokki, etc: that IQ question, and what surrounded it, wasn't nice at all either.
[12:32] <iter> no kidding
[12:32] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,  i have seen it b4
[12:32] <iter> play nice
[12:32] <lokki> LjL : ur right m8
[12:33] <bimberi> LjL++
[12:33] <iter> I mean he might be new and all but I guarantee there was a point where you had to learn what a mountpoint was
[12:33] <Kim^J> LjL: I'm sorry for it. I just can't stand when people argue something they selve proved right.
[12:33] <reus> hmmm now the ubuntu startup bar dont go away and im back stuck at 1 virtual desk when trying beryl again
[12:33] <Chewy954> whats a good app to make a partition w/o a live cd?

[12:33] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,  yea hang on
[12:34] <defrysk> <Kim^J> lokki: Maybe... Not my fault that he is stupid. ; not very friendly either by the way
[12:34] <Chewy954> whats a good app to make a partition w/o a live cd?
[12:34] <LjL> Kim^J: well, an issue is that this channel isn't even supposed to be for arguments, but purely for support... but anyway. i have bite my tongue oftentimes on this channel
[12:34] <GUARDiAN|nb> hi
[12:34] <LjL> have to
[12:34] <uksprout> anyone help? sometimes I have sound but after a reboot I can lose it, if I reboot several times or turn the system off it will eventually come back
[12:34] <linux_kid> Chevy954: it has to be done on a live cd, you cannot edit mounted partitions
[12:34] <corevette> when i try to install flash 9, i get this message: IOError: Failed to lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
[12:34] <fabiim> the /etc/crontab  file say's i don't have to run anything  but  it's not running , what services do i need to make this run? doesn't cron enough?
[12:34] <lifepositive> hi everyone
[12:34] <lifepositive> ColdFyre: hey hey
[12:35] <lifepositive> linux_kid: hi there
[12:35] <lokki> Oh well one less Ubuntu user
[12:35] <Kim^J> corevette: Install? Just put the libflash.so in the ~/.mozilla/plugins folder.
[12:35] <lokki> ;P
[12:35] <corevette> lupine_85 when i install flash in the terminal with gdebi, i get this message: IOError: Failed to lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
[12:35] <Chewy954> linux_kid, no, not my mounted partition, my allocated free space
[12:35] <Chewy954> i needa make a partiton outta it
[12:35] <iter> lokki: the problem is now he goes and tells all his friends that ubuntu users are jerks
[12:35] <corevette> Kim^J its a deb file
[12:35] <GUARDiAN|nb> i have a problem that is probably quite unusual: although i configured my X as singlescreen, it always is spanned over internal (notebook) and external vga-screen... my conf: http://www.alexanderhess.de/xorg.conf ...any ideas?
[12:35] <Kim^J> Chewy954: sudo cfdisk
[12:35] <bimberi> corevette: is synaptic open?
[12:35] <JuJuBee> My windows partition will not boot now. Where can I get assistance with repairing that partition?
[12:35] <poolkey172> THis is strange
[12:35] <corevette> bimberi, no
[12:35] <linux_kid> lifepositive: whats up
[12:35] <Kim^J> corevette: Get the Flash9 from Adobes site.
[12:36] <lokki> iter: Ok Ok i get it ;P
[12:36] <lupine_85> corevette: sudo
[12:36] <linux_kid> bbl
[12:36] <poolkey172> My system doesn;t have 'shutdown' or 'halt'
[12:36] <zipzo> anyone know a a GNU virtual machine, like WIn4Lin that i can try out?
[12:36] <ActivE> how can i clean the wastebasket with sudo privaleges
[12:36] <poolkey172> can I install them ?
[12:36] <defrysk> !flash9 | corevette
[12:36] <ubotu> corevette: You can download a Flash 9 installer here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy).  If you use GDebi to install it, make sure you open its terminal window (to answer an installer question).
[12:36] <lupine_85> e.g. in terminal: sudo dpkg -i (package-name)
[12:36] <bimberi> ActivE: sudo rm ~/.Trash/*
[12:36] <macgyver_79> poolkey...I have the same problem too, just installed ubuntu
[12:36] <corevette> sorry all, i forgot sudo
[12:36] <Kim^J> poolkey172: reboot or poweroff
[12:36] <lupine_85> gdebi is pretty pointless :)
[12:36] <Chewy954> thx Kim^J
[12:36] <urmom> can i run java on ppc?
[12:36] <ActivE> ty again bimberi :)
=== jomino is now known as number2
[12:36] <poolkey172> Kim : I need to halt
[12:36] <LjL> zipzo: what do you mean "a GNU virtual machine"?
[12:36] <bimberi> ActivE: np :)
=== number2 is now known as minime
[12:37] <Kim^J> poolkey172: poweroff
[12:37] <urmom> well?
[12:37] <ashaffer> I'm trying to install Edgy on a new computer here and I'm receiving this error before any real installation occurs:    /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off.  I've checked the support forums and nothing has helped, any ideas (if you need hardware setup, let me know)
[12:37] <||arifaX> ubotu: is there something similar for edgy?
[12:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is there something similar for edgy? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:37] <macgyver_79> Sorry!! I meant JuJuBee...I have the same problem too, just installed ubuntu
[12:37] <TonySoprano> can i change bash behavior, so that when i press ESCAPE the current line will be erase just like in a windows shell?
[12:37] <zipzo> like win4lin http://www.win4lin.com/ and GNU as in not commercial license
[12:37] <eobanb_> zipzo, like QEMU?
[12:37] <JuJuBee> ANybody tell me where I can get some help  with repairing my windows partition?
[12:37] <||arifaX> is there a deb flash 9 for edgy?
[12:37] <urmom> can i play runescape on a ppc pc?
[12:37] <defrysk> !flash9 > ||arifaX
[12:37] <bimberi> ubotu: tell ||arifaX about flash9 | via /msg
[12:37] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zipzo about qemu | zipzo, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:37] <urmom> i need java
[12:38] <eobanb_> JuJuBee, microsoft?
[12:38] <lifepositive> linux_kid: hi
[12:38] <Dreamglider> where did linux kid go ?
[12:38] <Kim^J> ||arifaX: Why use a deb for a single file?
[12:38] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zipzo about xen | zipzo, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:38] <MitchM> urmom, i need some coffee too.
[12:38] <JuJuBee> yes eobanb_
[12:38] <defrysk> !java > urmom
[12:38] <lifepositive> linuxboy_: hows linux going?
[12:38] <eobanb_> JuJuBee, no, that was an answer to your question.
[12:38] <JuJuBee> irc channel...
[12:38] <iter> ashaffer: how do you have your hard disks setup ?
[12:38] <zipzo> can QEMU be used like Win4Lin?
[12:38] <Spee_Der> !java | urmom
[12:38] <ubotu> urmom: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[12:38] <Kim^J> Baahh... Can't stand this anymore. Sleeeeep!
[12:38] <Kim^J> Nite all!
[12:38] <foudationclasses> !nvidia
[12:38] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:39] <LjL> zipzo, i don't really know what win4lin does, for starters
[12:39] <Chewy954> Kim^J, fyi, im on blag, and apt-get wont get cfdisk
[12:39] <Chewy954> :|
[12:39] <JuJuBee> Been dual booting for some time now and windows just crapped.
[12:39] <zipzo> http://www.win4lin.com/
[12:39] <zipzo> it allows you to run windows apps in a window in your linux desktop
[12:39] <Kim^J> Chewy954: apt-get it??? It's preinstalled.
[12:39] <LjL> zipzo: yes, i saw that. not easy to understand what exactly it is without reading through the marketing babbling, though
[12:39] <Chewy954> oh i didnt know
[12:39] <Chewy954> lol
[12:39] <Chewy954> thx Kim^J
[12:39] <poolkey172> Kim : I dont want to pull the power cable
[12:39] <poolkey172> There is no such command called 'poweroff'
[12:39] <gorski> is there some GUI for wine?
[12:39] <defrysk> poolkey172, sudo poweroff
[12:40] <Kim^J> poolkey172: sudo poweroff
[12:40] <LjL> poolkey172: there is
[12:40] <eobanb_> JuJuBee, i don't really see how that's related to ubuntu.  i suggest you contact microsoft tech support for solely windows issues
[12:40] <Kim^J> gorski: Why do you need a GUI?
[12:40] <lokki> poolkey172 : u dont have a nice red buttop in the upper screen?
[12:40] <poolkey172> I did /etc/rc0.d/S90halt start and it says 'halt' not found
[12:40] <LjL> zipzo: you can do that with wine
[12:40] <LjL> Ubotu, tell zipzo about wine | zipzo, see the private message from Ubotu
[12:40] <zipzo> unfortunately, i love ubuntu, but the software i need for my buisiness is sorely under-developed in linux
[12:40] <defrysk> poolkey172, also known as sudo shutdown -h now
[12:40] <zipzo> no you cant, wine wont run what i need it to
[12:40] <zipzo> neither can codeweavers
[12:40] <Onofrio> anybody can tell me where download  lib cpp for Kdevelop?
[12:40] <eobanb_> zipzo, what about crossover office
[12:40] <LjL> zipzo: then you're out of luck
[12:40] <zipzo> ya crossover cant either
[12:41] <poolkey172> poweroff, halt etc must ave got removed : How do I reinstall them ?
[12:41] <gorski> help and other
[12:41] <zipzo> not true, win4lin could do it, but im looking for something not commercial
[12:41] <LjL> zipzo: which is why i said you're out of luck.
[12:41] <eobanb_> zipzo, well what about free as in beer? because you could always use vmware
[12:41] <lokki> gorski: google "wine gui"
[12:41] <zipzo> vmware?
[12:41] <monkeyan> could anyone help me with an opengl problem i'm having?
[12:42] <LjL> !vmware
[12:42] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"). Instructions for VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[12:42] <LjL> zipzo: it's similar to qemu, but faster. it's a virtual machine.
[12:42] <uksprout> anyone help? sometimes I have sound but after a reboot I can lose it (mp3, video), if I reboot several times or turn the system off it will eventually come back
[12:42] <poolkey172> poweroff, halt etc must ave got removed : How do I reinstall them ?
[12:42] <zipzo> well then im not out of luck :P
[12:42] <defrysk> !anyone | monkeyan
[12:42] <ubotu> monkeyan: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:42] <eobanb_> poolkey172, you really don'
[12:42] <eobanb_> don't need to repeat yourself that much
[12:42] <zipzo> if only the wine world could catch up with my industry.
[12:42] <LjL> zipzo: again, you asked for non-commercial ("GNU"), which is why i said you're out of luck. you must know what you're asking ;)
[12:43] <LjL> zipzo: wine and vmware are completely different applications. qemu will run your windows apps fine, too (but slow)
[12:43] <zipzo> ok, my bad, how about "free" :)
[12:43] <lokki> poolkey172 : 'init 0' maybe??
[12:43] <eobanb_> zipzo, free software, or freeware?
[12:43] <Celldweller> guys im not gonna be much help... my partner (yea im gay) lost his job today...
[12:43] <defrysk> poolkey172, halt is an option as in "shutdown -h now" -h meaning halt
[12:43] <zipzo> as in, i dont pay to use it
[12:43] <Celldweller> i'll be in ubuntu offtopic
[12:43] <LjL> zipzo: wine lets you run Windows applications, each in their own window, with an API layer, making them just like native applications. VMWare is just a PC emulator
[12:43] <eobanb_> zipzo, because i already suggested vmware
[12:44] <lokki> poolkey172 :  not wanting to test it on my pc ;)
[12:44] <zipzo> ill be checking vmware, thanks. and i use wine extensively
[12:44] <poolkey172> lol aat u guys u simply dont know
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[12:44] <poolkey172> yanking the power  cable
[12:44] <lokki> poolkey172 :  u dont seem to know better am just an ordinary user like u
[12:44] <monkeyan> suggestions on how to fix my opengl so it doesn't crash whenever i open a program that uses it? i have a 4400ti ubuntu 6.10 nvidia driver 1.0-9629
[12:45] <zipzo> if i knew anything about helping wine to work with my apps i would do the work, but alas i know not
[12:45] <eobanb_> !patience > poolkey172
[12:45] <LjL> poolkey172: what *is* the problem? you can't turn off the PC? how do you know that "poweroff" and company aren't there?
[12:45] <Daviey> zipzo, Vmware can also be FREE.  All you need is the player and create 'machines' using http://www.easyvmx.com/
[12:45] <zipzo> ahhh thanks for that
[12:45] <poolkey172> LjL because halt is not installed
[12:46] <defrysk> geez
[12:46] <LjL> poolkey172: how do you know that?
[12:46] <poolkey172> I did /etc/rc0.d/S90halt start and it says 'halt' not found
[12:46] <LjL> poolkey172: did you "sudo" that?
[12:46] <defrysk> poolkey172, try stop
[12:46] <LjL> poolkey172: and, that's not even close to the right way for shutting down your system
[12:46] <poolkey172> stop not found
[12:46] <poolkey172> apt works
[12:46] <poolkey172> x work
[12:46] <LjL> poolkey172, "sudo halt"
[12:47] <poolkey172> everything else is ok

[12:47] <poolkey172> Ljl it doesnt exist
[12:48] <LjL> poolkey172: i asked you if "ls /sbin/halt" showed anything.
[12:48] <defrysk> poolkey172, how did you make it dissapear ?
[12:48] <iter> poolkey172: sudo shutdown -h now doesn't work ?
[12:48] <poolkey172> lol i dont know
[12:48] <uksprout> how do I troubleshoot an intermittent sound problem, cannot fond anything regarding this problem on the Ubuntu website
[12:48] <lokki> poolkey172 :  package with halt etc is initscripts
[12:48] <LjL> poolkey172: ok, "sudo apt-get --reinstall install sysvinit" if you're in Dapper, "sudo apt-get --reinstall install upstart" if you're in Edgy,
[12:49] <poolkey172> iterm no shutdown is a wrapper for halt :if halt doent work nor does shutdown

[12:59] <NuKe_MaNia> how  can get surruond sound  configured alsamixer but 2 channel sound
[01:00] <eobanb_> poolkey172, i'm sorry, but you have to understand that virtually everyone here are simply users like yourself; we're not canonical employees.
[01:00] <sigp239> lokki:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia in "Enable restricted packages" step #4, there is no "Add" button.

[01:00] <Tefad> is there any easy way to get wpa_supplicant working?
[01:00] <eobanb_> expecting 'professionalism' in an IRC channel is simply not realistic, poolkey172 .  now if you want to discuss it further you're welcome to pm me.

[01:01] <Joakim> Hi folks
[01:02] <Fevis_> help with gaim anyone?
[01:02] <Joakim> I wants to play back a DVD
[01:02] <eobanb_> Fevis_, just ask
[01:02] <Twinxor> what's up, Fevis_ ?
[01:02] <Joakim> But how?
[01:02] <sigp239> how do I know if I'm running the best kernel for my PC?
[01:02] <Yashiro> i want to make gnokii work :(
[01:02] <eobanb_> !restricted > Joakim
[01:02] <Chewy954> i forgot to ask
[01:02] <lokki> sigp239: go System->Administration->software sources and enable the restricted check box
[01:02] <Joakim> I have install libdvdread3
[01:02] <Joakim> and that stuff
[01:02] <Twinxor> sigp239: don't worry about it - the performance difference is negligible
[01:02] <Chewy954> whats the file i windows can read off of EXT3 partitions?
[01:02] <sigp239> Is this the best kernel for my system?  I have a P4 3.06Ghz with Hyper-Threading.  Right now I have this kernel 2.6.17-10-generic
[01:02] <Joakim> and totem-xine
[01:03] <NuKe_MaNia> how  can get surruond sound  configured alsamixer but 2 channel sound
[01:03] <eobanb_> sigp239, perhaps you would do better with -smp
[01:03] <sigp239> lokki: Okay I got it.  Looks like I already had restricted enabled.  I guess Ubuntu 6.10 enables restricted by default?
[01:03] <Twinxor> sigp239: in fact, 6.10 got rid of the different x86 kernels, so you can only use generic
[01:03] <Chewy954> ne1?
[01:03] <Joakim> So; how do I go from here?
[01:03] <sigp239> Twinxor: I can only use generic?
[01:03] <lokki> sigp239: dont think so but dosent matter i think ;)
[01:03] <Twinxor> well, maybe I'm wrong and eobanb_ knows
[01:03] <Twinxor> afaik they've taken the choice out of your hands
[01:04] <Tefad> am i to assume wpa_supplicant is only available to those that want to hack text files?
[01:04] <sigp239> eobanb_: do you know about kernels?
[01:04] <Chewy954> pls, i rly needa do this fast :|
[01:04] <Joakim> Can someone help?
[01:04] <Tefad> Chewy954: you really just need ext2
[01:04] <defrysk> !easysource > x-fak
[01:04] <Tefad> (existing ext3 filesystems are backward compatible)
[01:04] <nikin> i think i found the problem about my cpu
[01:04] <nikin> its a celeron
[01:04] <Chewy954> well im already in EXT3
[01:04] <Chewy954> :|
[01:05] <sigp239> shouldn't I be using the 686-smp kernel?
[01:05] <Chewy954> i had the file in the pas
[01:05] <Chewy954> t
[01:05] <Tefad> read my comment Chewy954.
[01:05] <bimberi> !dvd | Joakim
[01:05] <ubotu> Joakim: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[01:05] <Chewy954> but forgot the name
[01:05] <Joakim> please
[01:05] <eobanb_> sigp239, well as far as i know, hyperthreading does in fact tell the system that there are more than one CPU available, so, again, if you try an smp kernel you may see some performance increase.  not much, since hyperthreading isnt actually more than one CPU or core, but it's worth a shot.
[01:05] <Fevis_> when i close gaim i disappears, isnt it possible to make it stay in the tray?
[01:05] <Tefad> if you just want to read a file, ext2 or ext3 are nearly identical.
[01:05] <Chewy954> Tefad, i did, but im in ext3 and im not gonna switch for this :|
[01:05] <deitarion> Would removing the setuid bit on /bin/su on my Gentoo box give me something similar to Ubuntu's "sudo only" setup while still allowing me to log in via vc/0 (the only "securetty" I've defined) if I mess up my sudo config?
[01:05] <xen> Fevis_, just use the systray plugin.
[01:05] <nikin> can be that teh p3 celerons have fixed multiplyer?
[01:05] <Tefad> Chewy954: do you understand what i'm saying
[01:05] <Fevis_> ive allready did
[01:06] <thenetduck> can someone help me to get my microphone to work?
[01:06] <Tefad> Chewy954: am i to assume you're in windows, and you want to read a file from your linux drive/partition?
[01:06] <lokki> sigp239: Especial when all to do is just a click
[01:06] <Chewy954> Tefad, i guess not
[01:06] <thenetduck> I don't know how to get it to work.
[01:06] <Chewy954> no
[01:06] <defrysk> !upgrade > x-fak
[01:06] <Chewy954> im installing windows
[01:06] <Tefad> Chewy954: the windows driver can be for either ext2 or ext3. they can both read ext3 systems.
[01:06] <Chewy954> and i have files i needa transfer
[01:06] <Tefad> Chewy954: the only real difference is if you want to write the file system from windows.
[01:06] <Fevis_> xen ive installed that plugin allready
[01:06] <Dreamglider> i need help with wireless network
[01:06] <shwag> does /dev need to be populated with anything, or does udev just mount ontop of an empty directory ?
[01:07] <xen> Fevis_, then I don't know...probably need to ask one of the people better than me :P
[01:07] <Chewy954> im lost
[01:07] <Chewy954> :|
[01:07] <Fevis_> ok, thx anyway xen :D
[01:07] <Chewy954> ehh nvm
[01:07] <Chewy954> i'll try use acronis
[01:07] <Tefad> Chewy954: ext2 drivers can READ ext3 drives just fine.
[01:07] <thenetduck> join #ubuntu-utah
[01:07] <thenetduck> doh
[01:07] <sigp239> eobanb_: well I did 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' and it says I have 2 CPUs.  But I'm only using the 2.6.17-10-generic kernel.
[01:07] <Ernie> it's been a wile since i've used this OS i for got how to log in as root, is it su (user name)?
[01:07] <Chewy954> Tefad, no.... not that
[01:07] <Chewy954> fat32 to read ext3
[01:08] <eobanb_> sigp239, open synaptic and search for 'linux-image'
[01:08] <Tefad> Chewy954: you are making no sense.
[01:08] <FunnyLookinHat> Ernie, you don't login as root, you use sudo
[01:08] <defrysk> Fevis_, make sure to turn the systray plugin on in gaim
[01:08] <FunnyLookinHat> !sudo | Ernie
[01:08] <ubotu> Ernie: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:08] <Ernie> sudo
[01:08] <Ernie> k
[01:08] <Tefad> Chewy954: do you want to write files to the linux drive or read files from it
[01:08] <Chewy954> Tefad, nvm i got it
[01:08] <thenetduck> is there anyone that might be able to help me to get my microphone to work?
[01:08] <Chewy954> copy files from linux partiton into windows
[01:08] <lokki> sigp239: Generic can see that u have 2 cpus but cant use them effectivelly
[01:08] <Chewy954> like my music

[01:11] <caffiendo> eobanb_: I didn't know if there were linux drivers for it.
[01:11] <eobanb_> caffiendo, oh, is it like a USB microphone or something?
[01:12] <uri> Hey, where would I go to get help about running Quake IV on Linux? Sorry to ask here but I don't know much about irc.
[01:12] <addicted68098> Something tells me you need a codec (scraliontis)
[01:12] <caffiendo> eobanb_: no it's the All-In-Wonder AGP card
[01:12] <eobanb_> oh, wait, sorry, i got confused between you and someone else.
[01:12] <scraliontis> what do you mean(addicted68098)
[01:13] <eobanb_> caffiendo, the 9600 pro should work fine with the binary ati drivers
[01:13] <lokki> uri : did u check id software site for a linux installer ?
[01:13] <eobanb_> caffiendo, if it has some sort of on-board MPEG codec, that might not work.  i dont really know.
[01:13] <caffiendo> that sounds great!
[01:13] <addicted68098> You need specail codecs to play mp3's etc.
[01:13] <eobanb_> caffiendo, i would check in the myth channel though
[01:13] <sigp239> this is the easiest time i've ever had installing 3d nvidia drivers.....wow.  good job ubuntu.
[01:13] <jsestri2> Does anyone know of a good reverse firewall for linux?
[01:13] <uri> lokki: oh, i've got it installed fine. the only problem i have is that none of the characters or doors have bumpmaps so they look really bad.
[01:14] <scraliontis> i surly dont need a codec to have access to my webcam.

[02:36] <Dreamglider> dcordes, the device is called eth1 not wlan0 !
[02:37] <linux_kid> Hey, Dreamglider, have you got your wireless working?
[02:37] <dcordes> Dreamglider: does iwconfig give you something?
[02:37] <bimberi> unperson: I haven't tried to find one (and should)
[02:37] <unperson> poolkey172 / bimberi: Or at least get it to spit out the hashed host key entry that needs to be added to known_hosts so I can replace the right one?
[02:37] <macgyver_79> help! I screwed up my boot. The only OS I have now is XP inside an extended partition. But such aren't bootable right?
[02:37] <Dreamglider> dcordes, yes it sees the devicce as eth1

[02:42] <sigp239> grndslm: looks like version 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1
[02:43] <jvai_> the a30 work fine wired but it reads eth1
[02:43] <linux_kid> macgyver_79: give me a pvt of your partition table summary
[02:43] <TokenBad> pstangcslv, no...
[02:43] <AnthonyG> Assistance needed , I would be eternally greatful if someone would pick out what driver I need for the 2.6.17 kernel :(
[02:43] <Dreamglider> dcordes, ok done, but why does the usb card show as eth1 and not wlan# ? :/
[02:44] <macgyver_79> linux_kid: hda1 / free, hda2 EXTENDED (better be primary) with xp in hda5
[02:44] <pstangcslv> TokenBad: firewall?
[02:44] <Dreamglider> you know how to fix this ?
[02:44] <macgyver_79> linux_kid> its really messed up...I would like to have just hda1 with xp and that it. possibly start over next time correctly
[02:44] <TokenBad> pstangcslv, not unless its done auto...I didn't set one up
[02:45] <dcordes> Dreamglider: maybe that's because it is a custom made driver. it is a zyxel device, isn't it? well it doesn't matter anyways how your device is called... you can also call it ass4
[02:45] <macgyver_79> linux_kid/ pvt?
[02:45] <jvai_> help me some1
[02:45] <linux_kid> macgyver_79: do you have partition commander?  (the pvt was if you didnt want your partition table public)

[02:52] <ShadowSoul> zup peeps
[02:52] <x-fak> strabes> you have no idea for replacing ctrl+c by another sequence or key ?
[02:52] <eneried> hello? i have a question
[02:52] <lokki> sigp239 dont know if ur issue will be solved but its worth the try, lots of bugs are fixed on beta drivers
[02:52] <maynoth> what do you guys think about automatix?
[02:53] <linux_kid> eneried: what is your question?
[02:53] <sigp239> lokki: could it have something to do with selinux?
[02:53] <Madpilot> maynoth, best avoided
[02:53] <lokki> sigp239 dont think so
[02:53] <Gevaudan82> maynoth: not really worth it...it's easy enough to install software on ubuntu that fits your needs...compared to most other distros anyway
[02:53] <eneried> linux_kid
[02:53] <sigp239> lokki: this same lockup problem happened on fedora core 6 btw.  same_exact_problem
[02:53] <fatlip> maynoth: if you're going to use automatix.. be weary.. it could break your X
[02:53] <fatlip> it's broken mine before
[02:53] <eneried> i can't see some characters in console
[02:53] <maynoth> will it mess up system
[02:54] <maynoth> mess up my system
[02:54] <fatlip> but it should work fine
[02:54] <eneried> i see some other characters or strange characters
[02:54] <fatlip> this new update fixed a lot of it
[02:54] <maynoth> why doesn't ubuntu give a script installer which installs all the 3rd party non-free software?
[02:54] <linux_kid> eneried: yes, what is your problem?
[02:54] <lokki> sigp239 i told u before that this isnt ubuntu prob. it has todo with ur card vendor and nvidia linux drivers, try installing the beta drivers from the site to see if somethig changes
[02:55] <Madpilot> maynoth, legal reasons - and yes, automatix can break your system
[02:55] <Gevaudan82> maynoth: because it's in contrast to their mission statement...add the repos from ubuntuguide.org and follow the guide for most everything you need...it's easy enough
[02:55] <fatlip> wait.. i'm looking at this SD card in gparted.. and its telling me that the filesystem cannot be recognized
[02:55] <eneried> I don't mean console inside a window, i mean a... um tty? like the one openend when we press ctrl+alt+f1, when i write  for example i get a Y with an accent mark, and this is not the character i typed
[02:55] <fatlip> i cant delete or make a partition
[02:55] <XiXaQ> When was the last update for Edgy?
[02:56] <eneried> when i look for some files on system, some of them have accent in vowels, but console showed me strange characters
[02:56] <Gevaudan82> eneried: do you have ScrlLk/NumLk on?
[02:56] <bimberi> dcordes: i had a bit of google and some of the hits (eg. https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/mol/+bug/72084 ) suggest that include is no longer required.  Try commenting it out in the source perhaps.
[02:56] <sigp239> lokki: what packages do I need to remove before trying to install the drivers from www.nvidia.com?
[02:56] <grndslm> Amaranth:  thanks for helping me notice that, i needed to clean my sources.list out anyway!

[02:56] <Flannel> sigp239: what's wrong with the nvidia in the repos?
[02:56] <linux_kid> eneried: what is ttk (and pleez dont call me stupid)
[02:57] <sigp239> Flannel: after i install it, and login, my system crashes in about 1 minute.
[02:57] <macgyver_79> linux_kid: I sent it to u pvt/ly and publicly by mistake :P
[02:57] <tonyyarusso> Do items in a crontab that have the same time fields run sequentially in the order they're listed?
[02:57] <lokki> sigp239 none i think unless nvidia module is loaded someway, but u wouldnt be talking here i that was truth
[02:57] <maynoth> so heres a weird question
[02:57] <Flannel> sigp239: the nvidia from the website is the same as in the repos.  Although, I believe Seveas' repos has updated ones, beleive they're mentioned in the Wiki page
[02:57] <Flannel> !nvidia | sigp239
[02:57] <ubotu> sigp239: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:57] <maynoth> it says there is one update available
[02:57] <lifepositive> tonyyarusso: hi! whats new?
[02:58] <maynoth> but when I click it says my system is up 2 date
[02:58] <Gevaudan82> tonyyarusso: assuming they are set to run at the exact same intereval then I would say yes
[02:58] <maynoth> how do I make that icon go away without rebooting
[02:58] <lifepositive> fatlip: what does the other guy look like? :)
[02:58] <eneried> linux_kid, sorry I mean tty
[02:58] <fatlip> what?
[02:58] <linux_kid> macgyver_79, its ok, we are all victoms of "MBR" theft
[02:58] <tonyyarusso> lifepositive: Trying to automate open week logs
[02:58] <fatlip> oh
[02:58] <fatlip> i get it
[02:58] <lifepositive> fatlip: I said, what does the other guy look like? :)
[02:58] <fatlip> bloody ;)
[02:58] <lifepositive> tonyyarusso: ok
[02:58] <lifepositive> fatlip: heeh :)
[02:58] <eneried> just press ctrl+alt+f1 to go to a console and after that press ctrl+alt+f7 to go back to graphic desktop, the first is the tty i mean
[02:58] <lifepositive> fatlip: lol ok :)
[02:59] <eneried> I read this problem is related to edgy
[02:59] <macgyver_79> linux_kid> so...u have any idea how to pull out xp from the useless extended partition ?
[02:59] <lifepositive> fatlip: a good comment for you would be to say "you should see what the other guy looks like" :)
[02:59] <sigp239> Flannel: don't see anything about sevea repo
[02:59] <eneried> but i don't know how to fix it :(
[02:59] <Madpilot> lifepositive, this is a support channel - please take social chat to #ubuntu-offtopic or PM - thanks
[03:00] <lifepositive> Madpilot: ok sorry
[03:00] <linux_kid> macgyver_79: i advise reformating the ext# drives and moving the ntfs partition up to the top. use gparted, its included on the live cd for ubuntu
[03:00] <fatlip> i guess this SD card is dead
[03:00] <shwag> does  update-grub   reinstall grub to the bootsector too ?
[03:00] <fatlip> dang
[03:01] <Flannel> sigp239: sorry, thats ATI drivers, not nvidia ones.  The one in the repos are the current nvidia ones (the same you'd get from their website)
[03:01] <maynoth> so if I copy my all the files from a winxp system and system32 folder over to my .wine folder
[03:01] <sigp239> Flannel: According to synaptic, nvidia-glx is version 1.0.8776+2.6.17.6-1, and the ones on www.nvidia.com are version 1.0-9629.
[03:01] <maynoth> will that improve compatibility
[03:02] <macgyver_79> linux_kid: but wont reformatting the extended partition also delete the subpartition (xp) within it?
[03:02] <linux_kid> eneried: im a GNOME user, i suck at command line! i just use terminal, but i guarnetee someone else will help you if you change your user
[03:02] <linux_kid> macgyver_79: im not great with HDD w/ more than 4 partitions, sorry
[03:02] <eneried> what do you mean with if i change my user?
[03:03] <TiG4> Anyone know of a good download manager?

[03:03] <aphixe> hello
[03:03] <sigp239> so should I just buy a new nvidia video card?
[03:03] <maynoth> i heard edgy has problems with AM2 based systems
[03:03] <maynoth> is this true
[03:04] <aphixe> weird I do a Sudo -l  says I have access to all commands, but can even move a directory to somewhere protected
[03:04] <maynoth> because I would love to build a new dual core and run it on it
[03:04] <maynoth> I heard the new 2.6.19 kernel fixed the AM2 problems
[03:04] <sigp239> I paid a lot for my GeForce 6800 GT...but if it can't be supported by nvidia or ubuntu...I guess I'll just upgrade.
[03:04] <eneried> he he, good idea linux_kid... myabe i have to look for help at some other place
[03:04] <mikm[laptop] > maynoth- What AM2 problems?
[03:04] <Gevaudan82> aphixe: sudo doesn't support cd...do something like "cd /my/dir && sudo command"
[03:04] <burnin> is the ubuntu install only one CD?
[03:04] <lokki> sigp239 and the beta ones are 1.0-9742. try the 1.0-9629.first then the beta one's if the stable version dont work
[03:04] <eneried> see you linux_kid thanks for your help :)
[03:04] <K^Holtz> What directory is the kernel for linux found in? can anyone answer that quick?
[03:04] <TiG4> Gevaudan82, Im talking a GUI downloader
[03:05] <poolkey172> Oooooooooohhhhh
[03:05] <macgyver_79> linux_kid: ok thanks anyway
[03:05] <linux_kid> eneried: welcome!
[03:05] <poolkey172> may I please ask a question ? I'm really stuck
[03:05] <aphixe> Gevaudan82: well I dont know the root password, cuz really.. it never asked
[03:05] <maynoth> I just heard that edgy crashed on AM2 platforms
[03:05] <linux_kid> macgyver_79: sorry :( but you are welcome :)
[03:05] <mikm[laptop] > !ask | poolkey172
[03:05] <maynoth> and that it needed the new 2.6.19 kernel to fix it
[03:05] <ubotu> poolkey172: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:06] <K^Holtz> no1?
[03:06] <aphixe> Gevaudan82: I went and read during install whats your user name, password, never once did it ask root password
[03:06] <K^Holtz> !kernel directory
[03:06] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kernel directory - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:06] <maynoth> can anyone confirm or deny?
[03:06] <ead> K^Holtz, /boot usually
[03:06] <Gevaudan82> apachie: if you really want to reset it, restart your box, type e at the grub prompt then type the word single at the end of the line before pressing b to boot...then just type sudo passwd to set a root password
[03:06] <Flannel> aphixe: ubuntu doesn't have a root password.  What are you trying to do?  It's sudo -i for a root shell, but you just use sudo for normal commands, not sudo -i
[03:06] <soleblaze> Hey, I'm running edgy server..and whenever I connect to my nfs server, nfs and ssh dies.. has anyone seen/heard of this before?
[03:06] <poolkey172> Ok thanks : My question is that I have debootstrapped edgy successfully : then I do an apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and it fails
[03:06] <poolkey172> Have I missed anything ?
[03:06] <K^Holtz> ead: just /boot ?
[03:07] <Gevaudan82> aphixe: that will enable root however...by default your sudo password is the same as the user password you create
[03:07] <aphixe> Flannel: just trying to move some files, and also going to complie
[03:07] <CSonicGo> Heh, is edgy causing a lot of problems?
[03:07] <a52x3> test
[03:07] <ead> K^Holtz, It's usually wherever the boot loader is told to look.
[03:07] <Flannel> aphixe: just use sudo.  "sudo cp /yadda/yadda /somewhere/else"
[03:07] <AnthonyG> I read that build-essential is already on the Ubuntu CD , Is this correct?
[03:07] <Flannel> AnthonyG: the alternate CD, yes
[03:08] <Gevaudan82> AnthonyG: in edgy it is installed by default I belive...can't remember for sure but I believe so
[03:08] <CSonicGo> the only "problem" I can find is that my computer is so slow the settings daemon quits
[03:08] <poolkey172> help anyone ? what do I need to install kubuntu complete via apt ?
[03:08] <aphixe> Flannel: So is there any way to say use root gui setup, for like if I have tons of stuff I wanna copy or move
[03:08] <AnthonyG> Hm... I will just have to test it :) .
[03:08] <bimberi> AnthonyG: yes it is
[03:08] <Flannel> Gevaudan82: no, it's not installed by default.
[03:09] <ead> K^Holtz, it could reside in other places, but most dists create 1 only in /boot.
[03:09] <maynoth> hello  can anyone here tell me where I can find a database of motherboard compatibility in edgy
[03:09] <Flannel> aphixe: gksudo nautilus (just be very careful)
[03:09] <maynoth> I am looking at buying a new ASUS Crosshair with the Nvidia 590 chipset
[03:10] <Flannel> maynoth: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMotherboards  (it's not exhaustive, obviously)
[03:10] <bimberi> Flannel, AnthonyG: build-essential and its dependencies are on the Desktop/Live CD as well - in a small repository
[03:10] <Flannel> maynoth: you might find google a better resource
[03:10] <Flannel> bimberi: since when does the desktop CD have a repository?
[03:10] <maynoth> i tried but I haven't found anything yet
[03:10] <maynoth> thanks
[03:10] <AnthonyG> Would slmodem-2.9.11-20060727.tar.gz work in Edgy Eft?
[03:10] <bimberi> Flannel: since warty
[03:11] <CSonicGo> ok, small issue, the Forward button on the install is not clickable.
[03:11] <AnthonyG> bimberi: What should I yell at the terminal to install it?
[03:11] <bimberi> Flannel: well, dapper if we're talking _Desktop_ CD :)
[03:11] <CSonicGo> at least on the "set date/time"
[03:11] <lokki> bimberi: yup, think so also
[03:11] <Flannel> bimberi: ok, now.  That is obviously incorrect.  But still, I don't think there's a repository on Edgy anyway.
[03:11] <bruenig> CSonicGo, have you filled in everything
[03:11] <CSonicGo> yes bruenig
[03:12] <bimberi> Flannel: check it out, there's a pool directory at the top level
[03:12] <AnthonyG> CSonicGo: I ran into that problem as well, I believe it simply locks up. I was forced to unplug my machine.
[03:12] <bruenig> !version
[03:12] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[03:12] <bimberi> AnthonyG: sudo apt-cdrom add
[03:12] <AnthonyG> apt has a cdrom implementation? Hm....
[03:12] <Flannel> bimberi: ah, righ.  See it on Edgy.  Ah, there it is on dapper too.  How odd.  They mustve added that in 6.06.1
[03:12] <bimberi> Flannel: it's for stuff that's included but not installed by default
[03:13] <maynoth> well its a shame i cant find anything but hopefully it will work
[03:13] <CSonicGo> AnthonyG, there is a solution though
[03:13] <CSonicGo> just press enter :)
[03:13] <maynoth> I plan on installing edgy on my SATA1 and XP on my SATA2
[03:13] <AnthonyG> I should try this... Hm... Would save future troubles :D. All the dependencies are taken care of?
[03:13] <bimberi> Flannel: it's on my old dapper CDs.
[03:13] <Flannel> bimberi: not on mine.
=== Crankymonky is now known as _mikem
[03:14] <maynoth> anyone here know of a hardware sata switch
[03:14] <bimberi> Flannel: actually I'm not certain that it's on earlier releases
=== _mikem is now known as Crankymonky
[03:14] <bimberi> Flannel: are yours from shipit?
[03:14] <lokki> <Flannel> bimberi: ok, now.  That is obviously incorrect.  But still, I don't think there's a repository on Edgy anyway. "  well one should be less cocky
[03:14] <Flannel> bimberi: well, obviously it's not on anything prior to dapper, since they were a liveCD only.  But, I don't believe it's on 6.06, no.  the iso.
[03:14] <bimberi> lokki: unnecessary
[03:14] <gbrent> ok this is basic.. i am trying to search the whole system for hello.txt. the commands slocate and locate do not work in Ubuntu. Is there something else I should be using... just find?
[03:14] <Flannel> lokki: no.  the desktop CD didn't exist prior to dapper.
[03:15] <lokki> bimberi: i know, couldnt hold thought sry
[03:15] <bimberi> Flannel: I have shipit cd's here, and it's there
[03:15] <Megaqwerty> Okay, during study hall I stupidly allowed someone on my computer so they could experience linux. Big mistake. Now my menu is all messed up (on the right side of the screen with the power button and the like). Can someone please tell me how to re-arrange it?
[03:15] <bimberi> lokki: :)
[03:15] <lokki> bimberi: sry Flannel
[03:15] <maynoth> is it possible to set up ubuntu to dual boot from a second hard drive with windows allready on it
[03:15] <CSonicGo> I'm installing Ubuntu on an Inspiron 7000, and it works!
[03:15] <Flannel> maynoth: yep.  Details change depend on your specifics though.
[03:15] <Flannel> !dualboot | maynoth
[03:15] <ubotu> maynoth: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[03:15] <AnthonyG> And the command to add build-essential is: apt-cdrom add build-essential?
[03:16] <Flannel> AnthonyG: no, you apt-cdrom to add the cdrom repository, then just normal apt-get
[03:16] <Xenguy> gbrent: find / -iname filename.txt |less  ?
[03:16] <bieb> hey Flannel.. hows it going?
[03:16] <poolkey172> Hey whats build-essential ?
[03:16] <ezenu3> Megaqwerty, you can drag the entire panel from one side of the screen to another, and you can right click on one of the icons to move it, often
[03:16] <bimberi> AnthonyG: sudo apt-cdrom add, will add the cdrom's repository to the apt database, then 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
[03:16] <Xenguy> gbrent: as root
[03:16] <bruenig> poolkey172, build-essential is a metapackage that installs all the tools you need to compile
[03:16] <AnthonyG> Flannel: cdrom is it's own repository? Hm... What other treats are in there?
[03:16] <maynoth> flannel like what I want to do is install windows on one drive unplug it and install ubuntu on another, but have the ubuntu drive as primary
[03:17] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: that's not applicable...hold on I'll upload a screenshot to the net...
=== Crankymonky is now known as _mikem
[03:17] <Flannel> maynoth: yep.  No troubles there.  grub will take care of making windows believe it's on hda
[03:17] <bimberi> AnthonyG: it has windows versions of some software
[03:17] <Flannel> bieb: doing fine, thanks.
[03:17] <poolkey172> bruenig : thanks : ps do u know what package installs the base OS kernels etc
[03:17] <crazyphire> can anyone help me set up internet on my new ubuntu system
[03:17] <crazyphire> the ethernet is plugged in but i don't know how to set it up
[03:17] <AnthonyG> bimberi: Oi , I was greeted by it when I was checking the CD for proper burnage :)
[03:17] <aphixe> Flannel: I got one last issue right now, MySQL server's socket is not correctly configured
[03:17] <gbrent> Xenguy: if I want to install locate isn't that something like sudo apt-get install untils-locate or something
[03:17] <bruenig> !info linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic

[03:18] <Flannel> AnthonyG: it's just a small repository of stuff people may need, b-e is required to get networking working, etc.  The alternate CD is an even larger repository (it's little but a repository).
[03:18] <aphixe> Flannel: let me double check to see if I got it installed..
[03:18] <AnthonyG> I need to get networking , Erm ... Working :) . No one seems to want to answer my question however...
[03:18] <gbrent> Xenguy: find is just annoys me when i want to search the whole file system. I guess I am just lazy

[03:19] <AnthonyG> Would slmodem-2.9.11-20060727.tar.gz be sufficient for Edgy , And an Agere Systems 56K PCI Softmodem (V.92).
[03:19] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: http://img453.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotej6.png
[03:19] <bruenig> poolkey172, I am not sure on that. The kernel is already installed poolkey172 by default
[03:19] <Xenguy> gbrent: locate is faster, if it's updated regularly
[03:19] <bruenig> poolkey172, by which I mean I am not sure that is the right package
[03:20] <gbrent> Xenguy: do you know what the name of the package is to install? its something like utils-locate or something
[03:20] <poolkey172> bruenig : I'm building edgy from scratch I just need to know what packages i need to create a full system
[03:20] <poolkey172> bruenig : after debootstrap there is no kernel
[03:20] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: do you see what I'm talking about?
[03:21] <Xenguy> gbrent: findutils
[03:21] <kishan> can any one please help with installing the UBUNTU LIVE SUPPORT package how to patch it
[03:21] <bruenig> !info linux-image-generic

[03:21] <Xenguy> gbrent: there's also slocate, which is package 'slocate' :-)
[03:21] <bruenig> poolkey172, perhaps that is it. sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic
[03:21] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: are you there?

[03:21] <ubotu> Package ubuntu-main does not exist in any distro I know
[03:22] <crazyphire> can anyone tell me how to get to networking in ubuntu, do i need to have root access? its not in the menu
[03:22] <ezenu3> Megaqwerty, to fix the power button itself, can you right click on it, uncheck the Locked box, then right click and do "Move" and drag it to where you want?
[03:22] <poolkey172> what the
[03:22] <gbrent> Xenguy: findutils   thats it thanks man.
[03:22] <Flannel> poolkey172: ubuntu-minimial is the basics, ubuntu-standard is another one, then ubuntu-desktop is the full desktop
[03:22] <Xenguy> gbrent: install 'apt-search' too; then 'apt-file search <file>' to find info like that
[03:22] <gbrent> slocate is mainly Suse from what i have seen
[03:22] <cheeseboy> where can i get ubuntu cd cover?
[03:22] <Xenguy> gbrent: yw
[03:22] <Flannel> poolkey172: check packages.ubuntu.com for lots of info
[03:22] <kishan> can any one help please To patch the package so that i can get it on the menu as UBUNTU LIVE SUPPORT
[03:22] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: okay, so lemme show you a picture of how it was before all of this. The separator is all messed up as well.
[03:22] <Flannel> kishan: You'd have to get the source, change it, then rebuild the package.  Isn't that just done through GAIM though?
[03:23] <meheren> !reiserfs
[03:23] <ubotu> reiserfs is a journalling file system, in benchmarks it outperforms many others on I/O operations, but they take notoriously long to mount.
[03:23] <AnthonyG> Bah!
[03:23] <poolkey172> Flannel : I tried kubuntu-desktop after debootstrap it failed so there must be something I need before that
[03:23] <bimberi> cheeseboy: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing
[03:23] <Flannel> poolkey172: why are you doing that though?  trying to do a netinstall sort of thing?
[03:23] <AnthonyG> I have a feeling this is a lost cause.
[03:23] <linux_kid> !ntfs
[03:23] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:23] <Flannel> poolkey172: have you checked out the Wiki pages on netinstall?  (do you have a Cdrom drive? theres a netinstall CD, even)
[03:23] <bimberi> AnthonyG: I think you are going to have to try it and see
[03:23] <AnthonyG> Watch slmodem not work :( , and kill my Ubuntu partition.
[03:24] <poolkey172> flannel : I'll check netinstall maybe that will helo me
[03:24] <Xenguy> AnthonyG: I always thought modems were a black art :-)
[03:24] <AnthonyG> bimberi: It broke 5 packages , Which in turn brok3 83
[03:24] <AnthonyG> brok3=broke
[03:24] <bimberi> AnthonyG: eek
[03:24] <AnthonyG> I despise leet speak.
[03:24] <poolkey172> flannel : yes I have the kubuntu cdrom in the drive
[03:24] <kishan> Flannel thank for answering  here is the link which gives a patch but does not tell me how to patch can u help with that      https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuLiveChatSupport
[03:24] <bieb> Flannel.. can you help me with an alternate install, setting up software raid for my data drives? I have tried it a few times with no success. Its driving me batty
[03:24] <bimberi> AnthonyG: i'd call that tried and seen then
[03:24] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: nevermind, I can't find one. However, I wish to know how to fix that separator.
[03:25] <AnthonyG> bimberi: Then grub returned 17
[03:25] <Flannel> poolkey172: er, why aren't you just installing from the CD then?
[03:25] <Xenguy> AnthonyG: I thought it was poetry - oh well :P
[03:25] <AnthonyG> bimberi: It was with a different version driver :)

[03:26] <Xenguy> AnthonyG: hah
[03:26] <crazyphire> thanks!
[03:26] <AnthonyG> crazyphire: sudp
[03:26] <AnthonyG> sudo
[03:26] <ezenu3> Megaqwerty, you should also be able to not only right click on one of those items (including the separator), but you can right click, then click on remove, then add it again, but right clicking and doing "add to panel".. I don't know of any automated method of restoring a previous known 'good' config
[03:26] <AnthonyG> sudo [cmd] 
[03:26] <Flannel> poolkey172: the alternate CD can.
[03:26] <bieb> crazy.. in command line  sudo su
[03:26] <crazyphire> i don't know any commands
[03:26] <Flannel> !sudo | crazyphire
[03:26] <ubotu> crazyphire: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.

[03:27] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: seriously my utmost gratitude.
[03:27] <Flannel> poolkey172: the alternate CD has RAID options, I'm not sure about details, but I know it's supporte
[03:27] <khatahn> hi, sometimes when i enter a website with firefox, the firefox window is not updated unless i resize it. that is, if it was blank before entering the website, it stays blank until i resize the window. anyone else experienced this problem?
[03:27] <Xenguy> Shaba1: ?  xpdf ?
[03:27] <Shaba1> I am versed in the windows world but hardly know a thing about linux
[03:28] <blanky> LjL: are you there bud?
[03:28] <poolkey172> flannel : Do you know where I can find out more info ?
[03:28] <blanky> hey can I talk to someone smart? :P
[03:28] <ezenu3> Megaqwerty, lol, ok. at least your friend didn't really screw up your settings
[03:28] <Xenguy> Shaba1: what do you want to do?
[03:28] <Shaba1> much less the ubuntu ditro/flavor
[03:28] <blanky> how come when I Try 'sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev' it tries to remove my kubuntu-desktop package
[03:28] <Shaba1> Just start reading Xenguy
[03:28] <Flannel> poolkey172: try google, unfortunately the RAID factoid is a bit devoid of content for that
[03:28] <Shaba1> I mean its not like I can turn these computers down.
[03:28] <kishan> Flannel, thanks for answering https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuLiveChatSupport  in this link there is patch but he didnot mentiion how to use that patch can u help me with that
[03:28] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: yeah, that would have killed me. My life is becoming assimilated into that which is Ubuntu
[03:28] <nrdb> khatahn: I don't, is it random, or on some particular sites?
[03:28] <bieb> flannel.. I am having trouble with the software raid setup using the alternate CD, I am not trying to install to the raid, just configure it for my data drives
[03:28] <Shaba1> but I am stepping into an alien world here.
[03:28] <Xenguy> Shaba1: you want a tutorial for linux, or ...?
[03:29] <Shaba1> that would be nice
[03:29] <Flannel> kishan: the patch is a patch for the source files, the C files, it looks like.  there's a "patch" program that'll apply it
[03:29] <Xenguy> Shaba1: type 'linux tutorial' into Google (no quotes) - I bet you get a ton of hits :-)
[03:29] <Shaba1> but more particualarly for the ubunto distro.
[03:29] <poolkey172> flannel : u know what ? I read someone doing this last night but my alternate cd didn't have the same options as his : do u know how I check if my cd is upto date ?
[03:29] <bieb> shaba.. there is a book available from Marcel Gagne, "Moving to Ubunut" its pretty good for a beginner
[03:30] <Shaba1> Like somethign that will ease windows people into linux
[03:30] <kishan> Flannel ,can u tell me the name of the program i will apprecite your help
[03:30] <Xenguy> Shaba1: oh - check out the wikis and forum perhaps
[03:30] <Flannel> poolkey172: CDs aren't updated often, I guarentee it won't be up to date.
[03:30] <Flannel> kishan: "patch"
[03:30] <Xenguy> forums
[03:30] <poolkey172> flannel : is there anyway I can check if it's edgy and not edgy beta ?
[03:30] <Flannel> nrdb: [commands]  > file.txt
[03:30] <Xenguy> Shaba1: search 'ubuntu tutorial'
[03:31] <Flannel> poolkey172: um.  hmm.  Yeah.  Let me... remember what the file is.  It's a textfile in the root of the CD, I believe.
[03:31] <khatahn> nrdb: i'm not quite sure. it may work just fine for a while, but at some point i just need to keep resizing the window constantly while navigating through websites.
[03:31] <Shaba1> the organization that is giving us these computer are like "Hey its a computer"
[03:31] <bieb> shaba.. you can also come hang out here and learn too

[03:31] <Skwid_> i have some character encoding problems with my mounted fat32 partition
[03:31] <Skwid_> any help ?
[03:32] <Xenguy> Shaba1: Ubuntu works nicely, but it takes a little time to learn a new kind of system - it's pretty easy but it takes time I think :-)
[03:32] <Skwid_> this is my fstab line

[03:32] <Flannel> poolkey172: probably the README file.  Take a gander, see what it says.  It'll probably hav a date on it or whatnot.
[03:32] <bieb> Shaba1.. they will be able to adapt to Ubuntu pretty easily.. I was able to get my wife and 11 year old to use Edubuntu
[03:33] <Shaba1> I am not so worried about them as I am about me
[03:33] <Shaba1> :)
[03:33] <Xenguy> hah
[03:33] <Skwid_> any ideas ?
[03:33] <bieb> Shaba.. you will pick it up too
[03:33] <poolkey172> flannel : README is dated 20061025

[03:35] <crazyphire> the accout i made was OEM by mistake, and it doesnt have sudo powers anymoe!
[03:35] <bieb> Shaba.. dont sweat it dude.. it will all work out.. relax.. its like zen man
[03:35] <ciminous> i'm doing all with keyboard and im going crazt
[03:35] <Shaba1> See that is a perfect example
[03:35] <Shaba1> what the hell is sudo
[03:35] <Flannel> poolkey172: believe that might be a day or two before the final CD release.  Why are you worried about the final CD?  Youre packages will need updating anyway (to the current stuff).
[03:35] <ciminous> i dont know how to enlarge this window
[03:35] <Flannel> !sudo | Shaba1
[03:35] <ubotu> Shaba1: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:35] <Shaba1> and what the heck is mount
[03:35] <Shaba1> see what I eman
[03:35] <Shaba1> mean that is
[03:35] <Megaqwerty>  ezenu3: if you look at the parenthesis at the end of my last statement, I stated that that seperator doesn't look like the default one (none of those dots, just a line)
[03:35] <sigp239> during install of nvidia drivers it says I need libc.  How do I get that?  Thanks.
[03:36] <Xenguy> Shaba1: you 'mount' a filesystem
[03:36] <Flannel> Shaba1: there are some tutorials out there for linux beginners, or if you're wondering about specific commands, "man [command] " will give you the MANual for that command
[03:36] <poolkey172> flannel : I think I downloaded a beta a couple of days before the edgy release : Thats my worry : Maybe the beta didnt cater for dmraid devices
[03:36] <Bacta> if I decide to install this on my comp will I be able to dual boot with my XP OS already installed?
[03:36] <sigp239> How do I get libc header files on my system?
[03:36] <Xenguy> Shaba1: 'man man'  :-)
[03:37] <sigp239> What is ubuntu's libc development package?
[03:37] <bimberi> Bacta: yes ...
[03:37] <sigp239> Do I have voice in this channel?

[03:37] <ezenu3> Megaqwerty, maybe "Notification Area"
[03:37] <Flannel> poolkey172: ah, I imagine stuff like that didn't change at all.  And if so, only slightly.
[03:37] <Xenguy> sigp239: no voice :-)
[03:37] <Bacta> ok..so whats the latest version and does it come with dev tools like gcc, java and eclipse?
[03:37] <bimberi> sigp239: libc6-dev
[03:37] <sigp239> thanks
[03:37] <crazyphire> I installed OEM by mistake and I don't have access to users and groups, and I don't know how to use sudo, can anyone help?
[03:38] <bimberi> sigp239: yw :)
[03:38] <Flannel> Bacta: yes, those are all installable.
[03:38] <Megaqwerty> ezenu3: Yes, that's it THANK YOU SO MUCH (to everyone else, sorry for the caps)
[03:38] <Shaba1> Oh I have a LiveCD of ... Knoppix
[03:38] <Shaba1> I guess I better dust it off
[03:38] <poolkey172> flannel : I'm reading all over and finding plenty of ppl in trouble with ubuntu raid and they are all referencing the same doc is specific to 6.06
[03:38] <Bacta> can i have a link for the latest version?
[03:38] <nothrow> anyone know why: arch/i386/kernel/msr.c would not exist in my kernel headers directory?
[03:38] <Flannel> crazyphire: run "sudo oem-config-prepare" then reboot
[03:38] <crazyphire> Flannel: yes sir
[03:38] <ciminous> so, no mouse stuff? :)
[03:38] <kitche> Bacta: releases.ubuntu.com or download.ubuntu.com and download edgy
[03:39] <ciminous> btw, disconnecting it and connecting it again made it work
[03:39] <ciminous> , but why did it stopped in the first place :(
[03:39] <Bacta> thankyou sir
[03:39] <phpnuborn> ok.. i have a router with NAT and Port Forwarding. i have 2 computers connected to it. 1 win-xp-pro-sp2(router assigned IP 192.168.0.2) and 1 ubuntu(router assigned IP 192.168.0.6) with ftp server. I can ftp from the win-xp computer to ubuntu computer using 192.168.0.2. how can the FTP server on the ubuntu computer be accessed from the internet?
[03:39] <poolkey172> flannel thanks again for your help looks like I'm a loner on this one :(
[03:40] <crazyphire> Flannel: may I PM you?
[03:40] <Bacta> does it come with that cool XGL stuff?
[03:40] <Flannel> !raid | poolkey172, check the... LVM link.  That might have what you need.

[03:40] <Bacta> so i can install that package during setup?
[03:40] <crazyphire> Flannel: I can't keep up with both computers and all this chat :(
[03:40] <fdelacruz> hi guys
[03:40] <Flannel> Bacta: after setup is easiest.
[03:41] <maxxism> phpnuborn did you forward the port on the router too?
[03:41] <poolkey172> Lol I read that years ago and got raid working very well on redhat but ubuntu is being awkward
[03:41] <Bacta> if i lose all my pr0n doing this im holding u guys personally responsible :P
[03:41] <Bacta> 6.10 is edgy right?
[03:41] <maxxism> bacta yes
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor`off
[03:41] <Flannel> poolkey172: any debian LVM/RAID setup documentation should be similar enough.  The alternateCD uses debianinstaller (with small modifications, if any)
[03:41] <Geocritter> hey guys, anybody having issues with hard drives not parking on laptops?
[03:41] <phpnuborn> i have port forwarded in the past.. that what i need to do here too?
[03:42] <Flannel> Bacta: yes.
[03:42] <ciminous> uh, and any idea why amd64 version doesnt work on an amd64 x2?
[03:42] <ciminous> the 32 bit goes ok live, 64 not
[03:42] <Megaqwerty> phpnuborn: it looks like it
[03:42] <poolkey172> Flannel can I install debianinstaller ?
[03:43] <maxxism> phpnuborn log into the router's web interface(check your router instructions)  and find forwarding,  and forward port 21 to your computer with the FTP
[03:43] <Flannel> poolkey172: the alternate CD uses the debian installer
[03:43] <Whatsisname> hey, quick question
[03:43] <phpnuborn> just 21?
[03:43] <macgyver_79> question, can grub load an os in an extended partition???
[03:43] <Whatsisname> say I have a hostname of bob in my hosts file pointing to 192.168.1.151
[03:43] <Flannel> macgyver_79: yep
[03:43] <Megaqwerty> phpnuborn: I haven't done it before, but I am pretty sure that 21 is ftp
[03:43] <maxxism> phpnuborn standard port for ftp.
[03:43] <Whatsisname> is there a command that if I run "somecommand 192.168.1.151" it will report bob
[03:43] <phpnuborn> cool.. port forwarding is easy
[03:43] <Whatsisname> nslookup I thought would work but it doesnt
[03:43] <Geocritter> anbody running ubuntu on a toshiba laptop?
[03:44] <macgyver_79> flannel> I really messed up the boot while trying to install ubuntu
[03:44] <justin_> Why does my monitor go light and then darker when I switch from X to consoles via ctrl-alt f1 etc?
[03:44] <maxxism> phpnuborn running an ssh server would be more secure.  and just as fast.
[03:44] <ciminous> mouse went off again
[03:44] <ciminous> after 3-4 minutes of use
[03:44] <gravyface> anyone familiar with a command line utility for rebuilding part files (.001, .002, .003, etc.)?  Been using WinRAR but I'd like to find something in ubuntu/linux
[03:44] <phpnuborn> the ubuntu box has that too
[03:44] <justin_> gravyface: rar
[03:44] <gravyface> doh
[03:44] <maxxism> phpnuborn learn ssh mmm mmm good
[03:44] <gravyface> lol
[03:44] <macgyver_79> flannel: can I send u a few lines that show the partitions?
[03:44] <Megaqwerty> phpnuborn: just to make sure you have everything set up correctly,
[03:44] <ciminous> who said linuxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[03:44] <Megaqwerty> !ftp | phpnuborn
[03:44] <ubotu> phpnuborn: FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: ftpd, proftpd, pure-ftpd, twoftpd, vsftpd
[03:44] <ciminous> oohhhhh
[03:45] <phpnuborn> but i'm doing it just as a test.. to see if it can be done
[03:45] <justin_> gravyface: They have one for linux, simply go rar x first part, and it will unrar the rest by itself -- just like in windows, but in console.
[03:45] <ciminous> now the keyboard went off too
[03:45] <gravyface> justin_: thanks man
[03:45] <justin_> gravyface: yup
[03:45] <[1] wenko> hey there, I am interested in using Ubuntu as a small server for BIND and DHCP and such...
[03:45] <[1] wenko> is this a good idea?
[03:45] <__mikem> ciminous, that used to happen to me a lot on my fedora core machine
[03:45] <lokki> Whatsisname cat /etc/hosts | grep 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' if this would work
[03:45] <poolkey172> Flannel : Thanks again : Someone give flannel a gold star : top crew member
[03:45] <sigp239> what's the x.org sdk/development package?
[03:45] <ciminous> hey mikem, finally some help...why did it happens?!?
[03:45] <lokki> Whatsisname where 127.0.0.1 the ip
[03:45] <justin_> gravyface: Keep in mind you have to download it first ;) -- you can get it at www.rarlabs.com -- I believe, same site as winrar.
[03:46] <Whatsisname> yeah that should work i suppose
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[03:46] <gbrent> ciminous: annoying
[03:46] <gravyface> justin_: I think I can handle that part ;)
[03:46] <phpnuborn> this pre-configured ubuntu VM computer has vsftpd already on it
[03:46] <Whatsisname> although I would like it to also work on outside dns names
[03:46] <Whatsisname> I'm sure there is some common program or mechanism to do it
[03:46] <ciminous> gbrent sorry about the multiple
[03:46] <ciminous> x
[03:46] <Whatsisname> just I don't know what it is
[03:46] <Flannel> sigp239: xorg-dev
[03:46] <ciminous> my keyboard went off
[03:46] <ciminous> and kept "striking" x
[03:46] <AngryElf> How can I make the firefox zoom-in/out work smoother (sadly, the way it works in windows) ?
[03:46] <Megaqwerty> phpnuborn: cool
[03:46] <__mikem> ciminous, for me it happened when I was using vmware because vmware was performing so slowly that it didn't clear the keyboard input buffers quickly enough, and consequentially the computer would reread the last input over and over again till vmware finally cleared the buffer
[03:47] <ciminous> is the LIVE CD vmware?
[03:47] <sigp239> Flannel: is it normal for xorg-dev to depend on like 75 other -dev packages?
[03:47] <__mikem> ciminous, no
[03:47] <Flannel> sigp239: yep.  It's a meta-package
[03:47] <phpnuborn> it has..  xubuntu, apache, samba, ftp, ssh, mysql, php..
[03:47] <crazyphire> Flannel: I ran that command and rebooted, nothing happened? I can' get to users/groups
[03:47] <ciminous> so i guess i'm better off not migrating to linux :)
[03:47] <sigp239> Flannel: k thanks
[03:48] <ArrenLex> I want to backup the packages that are being upgraded before upgrading, so I can easily downgrade to them if needed. Is there a utility which will let me do this?
[03:48] <__mikem> ciminous, I wouldn't say that
[03:48] <Flannel> crazyphire: you didn't get a setup thing? to setup your (real) user and stuff?
[03:48] <lokki> Whatsisname use nslookup in along with grep to report a single line answer.(am sure there is a better way thought)
[03:48] <crazyphire> no
[03:48] <jb0nd38372> How is the mount command structured , to mount a sata hardrive thats formatted for ntfs, read only?  Tried the one on ubuntu forms and it returned an unrecgonized file system error.
[03:48] <crazyphire> i really need an accoun that can setup networking
[03:48] <ciminous> i would, i dont wnat to fight with a buggy mouse and keyboard, reaching the back of the comp every 5 minutes
[03:48] <ciminous> i need steady running and workspace
[03:48] <sigp239> can I try this one guys?  jb0nd38372:  man mount
[03:48] <sigp239> hehe
[03:48] <__mikem> ciminous, the buggy mouse and keyboard have nothing to do with linux, in the absence of vmware, its a hardware problem
[03:49] <wceoscar> i installed automatix but noticed that i have the old version... how can i remove it?
[03:49] <ciminous> like usb controller not totally compatible?
[03:49] <Flannel> crazyphire: that's.... very odd.  You're supposed to run that, then it'll propmt you through some final setup stuff (examples: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview ), At this point, it might be easiest for you to just reinstall, since you've obviously not done too much on this install.  Reinstall and don't use the OEM mode this time ;)
[03:49] <nothrow> Anyone know why msr.c would not be in my kernel headers? Make giving this error: make[2] : *** No rule to make target `arch/i386/kernel/msr.c', needed by `arch/i386/kernel/msr.o'.  Stop.
[03:49] <slinky_> hi folks, I just lost my system, because I didn't know how to recover it. I had ubuntu and kubuntu bot loaded and while in KDE my system started dragging bad, so i closed session and could not restart it after, it accepted password for both GNOME and KDE but would then put up black screen with hour glass then come back to login screen. Can some one tell me what I SHOULD have done to recover instead of reinstalling from scratch next 
[03:50] <__mikem> Ubuntu used to have some issues with usb, but they fixed that. What are the specs of the computer you are trying to run ubuntu on?
[03:50] <Flannel> wceoscar: automatix is not supported here because it breaks stuff.  Please ask in #automatix
[03:50] <SemNick> erro msg: buffer i/o error on device hdc, logical block 1 how  HELP PLZ!!!!
[03:50] <wceoscar> yes... but how can i remove it??
[03:50] <Flannel> wceoscar: no idea.  Is it a deb? or just a script?
[03:51] <ciminous> it's a dell dimension c521
[03:51] <ciminous> bought 2 months ago
[03:51] <wceoscar> Its a script
[03:51] <ciminous> amd dual core, 1 gb ram, sata hd
[03:51] <__mikem> CPU speed and memory?
[03:51] <Flannel> wceoscar: then just delete the script, and it'll be gone.
[03:51] <ciminous> 4200+
[03:51] <__mikem> heh, that should be enough.
[03:51] <crazyphire> can anyone please help me with networking/sudo, i need to know how to access these things!!! im new and need help
[03:51] <wceoscar> how can i do that?
[03:51] <__mikem> more than enough
[03:51] <wceoscar> i dont even remember the script
[03:51] <__mikem> TRy a different mouse and keyboard
[03:51] <ciminous> i havent :(
[03:52] <Flannel> wceoscar: I have no idea.  You'll have to ask the #automatix people.
[03:52] <__mikem> ciminous, no thats what I want you to do
[03:52] <gravyface> justin_: whats the param for joining .00* files with rar?  not quite sure whats what.
[03:52] <Madpilot> wceoscar, you're now learning one reason why Automatix is such a problem - it's harder to get rid of than a properly packaged app...
[03:52] <Flannel> wceoscar: I imagine it'll depend on where you saved it, which they might know.  Or, you can find (check home dir? downloads dir?) then just delete it.
[03:52] <ciminous> i cant, i havent the hardware :)
[03:53] <__mikem> well, even if you use windows, those problems will still exist if it is a hardware problem which I am convinced it is
[03:53] <slinky_> LJL: can you please help me
[03:53] <macgyver_79> flannel: what do I have to do to add an extended partition containing an os (xp) to the grub
[03:53] <wceoscar> ok
[03:53] <Flannel> crazyphire: sudo allows you to escilate a command to run with higher permissions, ubotu has mentioned the sudo page a few times.  If you also need help with networking, that's another issue, the two arent' really related.  Check here for documention on sudo : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[03:54] <ciminous> in windows everything works perfectly
[03:54] <ciminous> never had a single crash in these 2 months
[03:54] <macgyver_79> flannel: I am in new-installed ubuntu and it recognizes the winxp partition
[03:54] <Flannel> macgyver_79: uh, I'm not sure windows can be put on an extended partition, actually.  But, it's just editing the grub menu and adding the appropriate commands.
[03:54] <JasonMcG> <--- needs some help with xubuntu wireless
[03:54] <__mikem> ciminous, besides the occasional sticky key, what other problems do you have?
[03:54] <sigp239> quit
[03:55] <wceoscar> Ok... i just got rid of that... now what type of app would you recommend instead of automatix??? easy ubuntu?
[03:55] <macgyver_79> flannel: I know its strange. THe extended partition basically wraps arounnd the only single partition which is xp. really useless
[03:55] <ciminous> well, extreme laggyness of the scrolling in gaim (but i guess it's live version), mouse, key, something blabbing about scr0 when booting, 64 bit version not booting from the cd
[03:56] <ciminous> sorry if i made some mistakes, i'm from italy
[03:56] <maurox> hello with beryl i can find the plugin taht controls the opening aplicacions for example, when i open a console doesnt birng to the first option just stay behind wheever program opened :S
[03:56] <Flannel> wceoscar: easy ubuntu plays nice with your system, sure.  But there are also howtos on everything those provide.  You'll get your hands a little dirty, but learn a lot about how linux works in the process.
[03:56] <__mikem> Are you using the 64 bit version?
[03:56] <bruenig> maurox, #ubuntu-xgl
[03:56] <phpnuborn> my netgear router sees the computer name for my win-xp-pro pc.. but has no computer name for the ubuntu computer..    Can a *nix pc be given a 'Computer Name' like my windows pc?
[03:56] <ciminous> no, 32 bit right now
[03:56] <maurox> thx :)
[03:57] <ciminous> 64 will display ubuntu splash in black and white and hang
[03:57] <__mikem> Could be a problem with 32 bit emulation mode
[03:57] <wceoscar> i now.... can you give me a link with the last version of easy ubuntu?
[03:57] <bruenig> !easyubuntu

[03:57] <Flannel> phpnuborn: either your hostname, or I imagine you're tlaking about for windows networking and stuff?  That's all samba based.

[03:58] <ciminous> i noticed usb peripherals hangs when the cd loads something :S
[03:58] <Kud0s|sleeping> can anyone tell me how to run a process in the background from the command line?
[03:59] <Flannel> macgyver_79: well, I don't know about the exact text... google returns this, which looks right: http://blog.firetree.net/2005/08/26/duel-boot-windows-with-grub/  (mapping is the key, since it makes windows think it's on hda)
[03:59] <__mikem> ciminous, did you try different usb ports? Its posible that the usb ports are bad.
[03:59] <Flannel> Kud0s|sleeping: & after the command
[03:59] <ciminous> i can, but i dont think so, as the pc is brand new and always used these 2 and everything went always well
[03:59] <phpnuborn> the Windows "My Network Places" sees the ubuntu pc just fine.. computer name and all..  its the router that doesn't
[03:59] <ciminous> i'll try at the next hang
[03:59] <Kud0s|sleeping> Flannel, ill give it a go. what about if it has arguements? after those too?
[03:59] <ArrenLex> Kud0s: add a & to the end of the command.
[03:59] <Flannel> slinky_: you'll have to give more information.  What's wrong, what you did, etc, etc.  "Broken" doesn't tell us a whole lot
[04:00] <ArrenLex> Kud0s: i.e. "firefox &"
[04:00] <Flannel> Kud0s|sleeping: yeah, at the end of the line.

[04:02] <Flannel> SemNick: Check your hardware connections
[04:03] <slinky_> Flannel: neither logon would work, the only thing i could get up was the console and I didn't know enough to recover using the console, what i would like to know is what can I do next thime so I don't have to rebuild again
[04:03] <phpnuborn> on my win-pc  in System Properties, Computer Name tab.. i entered Overkiller-64 in the Full Computer Name
[04:04] <slinky_> Flannel: I had to rebuilt using Dapper Drake, lost everything, I could not get internet access to ask for help
[04:04] <Jordan_U> My gnome power applet says I am not running on battery when I am, so when I do run out of battery the computer shuts down improperly because gnome-power-management doesn't think it needs to shut down when the laptop is plugged in, which it is not.
[04:04] <axisys> 8 out of 10 times i need to kill firefox and kill esd and restart ff to get sound on youtube.. is there a work around.. i am really tired of doing it that frequent
[04:04] <Jordan_U> !flash9 | axisys
[04:04] <ubotu> axisys: You can download a Flash 9 installer here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/backports/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy).  If you use GDebi to install it, make sure you open its terminal window (to answer an installer question).
[04:04] <phpnuborn> my netgear router sees that computer name..  can  ubuntu be made to give the router its computer name?
[04:04] <Flannel> slinky_: sure.  Actually, try this.  At the login screen (GDM or KDM, depending on your setup), choose the "rescue mode" or "safe mode" or whatever, under "session", and login.  See if that works
[04:05] <bruenig> axisys, what flash plugin are you using?
[04:05] <axisys> Shockwave Flash 9.0 d55
[04:05] <axisys> Jordan_U: already using 9
[04:06] <slinky_> Flannel: I no longer have that system, it's all gone, I am running Dapper Drake now, starting from scratch, what I don't know is what SHOULD i have done
[04:06] <bruenig> axisys, they have a second beta out if you want to try that
[04:06] <bruenig> axisys, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279990
[04:07] <axisys> bruenig: sure let me try.. anything to get that sound consistent.. i guess esd is not the problem ?!
[04:07] <Flannel> slinky_: oh.  Well, that depends a lot about what's wrong.  Which couldve been a few things.  I imagine it was gnome/kde startup files.  Safe/whatever mode wouldve bypassed those.  Or you wouldve had to delete/disable them from the command line.  But, again.  It all depends.  Next time it happens, log on to here (via irssi on the command line if nothing else) and I'm sure someone will be able to diagnose/fix it.
[04:07] <Jordan_U> bruenig: That really should be linked too from ubotu if the sevaes link does not have the newest version.
[04:07] <bruenig> axisys, it is just a shot in the dark, couldn't hurt. Although it may not fix anything
[04:07] <sigp239> Flannel: so far no lockup....
[04:08] <slinky_> ok Flannel, thank you very much, it is well appreciated
[04:09] <sigp239> Flannel: looks like the nvidia driver from www.nvidia.com solves the lockup problem.
[04:09] <Flannel> slinky_: just remember that command ;)  Or, "irc" is symlinked to irssi (by default), and should launch another client if you've configured it that way.  So, just come here and ask.  Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer, like most things.

[04:11] <newbuntu> when I open xine I dont see a movie playing, just a black box
[04:11] <slinky_> Flannel: One quick question please when you see 0ubuntu4, what does the 0 and the 4 represent?
[04:11] <noclue> i asked about my screen resolution before, i had to re install and it was fine and running 1240 x something but now it is stuck at 800 x 600
[04:11] <bieb> Flannel.. I have looked at most of those, they are geared towards building the Raid array to install to
[04:11] <noclue> what  do i do to fix this??
[04:12] <Flannel> slinky_: versions?  Can you psate the whole version number?
[04:12] <newbuntu> I see everything from my desktop fine on the TV except movies are blank, any help?

[04:13] <w3ccv> noclue, ther is a change screen resolutionin the admin menu
[04:13] <Flannel> bieb: oh, Actually.  Those links are ... bad.  Go to help.ubuntu.com and search for RAId, you'll get a few good ones: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LVMOnRaid  is one
[04:13] <jbroome> noclue: third time:  http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[04:13] <slinky_> Flannel: when in Synaptic, it shows after the filename, I was wondering what the leading and trailing digits represent
[04:13] <axisys> bruenig: looks like it.. i did not kill esd
[04:13] <korupt> does anyone know how to get the mount icons on the desktop?
[04:13] <korupt> off of it
[04:13] <noclue> ha ha jbroome i have been there
[04:14] <bruenig> axisys, yeah one of my shot in the dark cross your finger fixes finally pays off
[04:14] <axisys> bruenig: well i happends sporadic
[04:14] <bieb> ok.. Flannel.. I will look at that one
[04:14] <newbuntu> does anyone here use their  TV as a moniter to watch movies?
[04:14] <noclue> w3ccv the problem is on the admin > screen res option it is stuck at 800 x 600
[04:14] <Flannel> poolkey172: you too may be interested, what I just told bieb about.
[04:14] <axisys> bruenig: hopefully it wont happend again.. i will report here if it does
[04:15] <Flannel> slinky_: well, thats... which file?  thats a partial version number.  do you have a version column shrunk down or something?
[04:15] <willsomebody> does anyone know why my LITE-ON lightscribe  drive is not recognized by LaCies's 4L
[04:16] <slinky_> Flannel: do you have a URL explaining the format by change, i'll have to check on screenlayout when i open it
[04:16] <slinky_> oops by chance
[04:18] <anan> how can i run directly my python program without the prompt window to choose between Display, Run etc... ?
[04:18] <DaveQB> How do you update the superblock in an MD device with mdadm so that the drive can be auto detected and build back into the RAID  upon next boot.
[04:18] <DaveQB> anan python <filename>
[04:18] <Flannel> slinky_: sure, like this: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/gnome/abiword-gnome the version is (2.4.5-0ubuntu2)  which means when we added it to the repos, we got 2.4.5-0 (probably from debian) then if there's a "ubuntu#" that means that it's the # revision (in this case 2) specific to ubuntu.
[04:18] <willsomebody> can anyone see this message
[04:18] <Jordan_U> willsomebody: yup
[04:18] <DaveQB> willsomebody  yes
[04:18] <Flannel> willsomebody: nope
[04:18] <bruenig> willsomebody, sort of I saw "his message"
[04:19] <Belboz99> hey all, I need the command to detect USB devices, I have a device that I just turned on and it's not listed in lsusb
[04:19] <MrGiMmE> Failed to fetch http://xgl.compiz.info/pool/main/m/mesa/libglu1-mesa-dev_6.5.1+cvs20060824_i386.deb  Could not connect to xgl.compiz.info:80 (195.14.0.203). - connect (111 Connection refused)
[04:19] <MrGiMmE>  <<< Any alternate servers?
[04:19] <Flannel> MrGiMmE: ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[04:19] <MrGiMmE> They never help :(
[04:19] <slinky_> Flannel: 3:3.3.6 -1ubuntu6.1 Qt3 Developer ......, what is the first -1 represent?
[04:19] <Flannel> MrGiMmE: then try #beryl or #xgl.  This is not an appropriate place
[04:19] <willsomebody> does anyone know why my LITE-ON lightscribe  drive is not recognized by LaCies's 4
[04:20] <funkja> How do I extract a .gz file?
[04:20] <SonicvanaJr> Is there a way to remove packages that are linked to ubuntu-desktop, without removing ubuntu desktop ?
[04:20] <bruenig> willsomebody, that is incredibly obscure, probably more of a forum question. That is why no one is responding.
[04:20] <willsomebody> oh
[04:20] <willsomebody> ok
[04:20] <Flannel> slinky_: when we got it, it's probably debian got it as 3.3.6 then changed it to -1, then we go tit, then changed it a few times. to 6.1 (whatever that means, whether 6 major and 1 minior revision, or whatever)
[04:20] <Flannel> SonicvanaJr: "ubuntu-desktop" is just a meta package, it's safe to remove
[04:20] <Flannel> SonicvanaJr: it won't remove your desktop
[04:21] <SonicvanaJr> Flannel, thanks
[04:21] <bimberi> funkja: gunzip file.gz
[04:21] <slinky_> Flannel: ok, that makes sense, thank you for all your help, and have a great day
[04:21] <SonicvanaJr> I figured it wouldn't, but I didn't know how safe it was to remove
[04:21] <Jordan_U> SonicvanaJr: Just be sure to put it back for upgrades like Dapper -> Edgy
[04:21] <sigp239> Flannel: still no lockup.....I think this is a winner
[04:21] <Flannel> Jordan_U: update-manager will do that for him now.  but yes.  SonicvanaJr, make sure you re-install it before upgrading
[04:21] <funkja> thanks
[04:22] <slinky_> goodnight folks
[04:22] <Jordan_U> Flannel: Thanks, didn't know that.
[04:22] <SonicvanaJr> Flannel, is that just for distro upgrades. Yes, I'm assuming.
[04:22] <britt> guys how do i enable a console on com1?
[04:22] <Jordan_U> SonicvanaJr: Yes
[04:22] <britt> i remember having to edit some file
[04:22] <DevC> updating ubuntu the rest of the way but dying laughing at this while I'm waiting -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7_ERC3tAwY&mode=related&search=    I'm really bored lol
[04:22] <noclue> I have tried all the stuff on ubuntu help and can't fix this 800 x 600 res problem can anybody help??
[04:22] <bruenig> !offtopic
[04:22] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[04:23] <korupt> does anyone know of a way to remove the mount icons from the gnome desktop?
[04:23] <Flannel> SonicvanaJr: yeah.  normal updates are fine without it.  During dist-upgrades package names may change, or whatever.  so "xxxx" may become "yyyy" and you won't get "yyyy" unless something depends (ubuntu-desktop) on it
[04:23] <SonicvanaJr> Flannel, gotcha. Thanks :)
[04:24] <poolkey172> Flannel what was that ?
[04:24] <noclue> Can anybody help me with my screen resolution problem?? everything i am trying is not working
[04:24] <noclue> plz help
[04:25] <britt> noclue, try this
[04:25] <sigp239> Flannel: I spoke too soon....my system locked up
[04:25] <DevC> bruenig: not off topic....I'm waiting for the next issue that pops up while upgrading ubuntu and thought I'd share a funny vid while everyone is waiting for help
[04:25] <noclue> britt whats that??
[04:25] <bimberi> britt: /etc/inittab
[04:25] <sigp239> Flannel: but it lasted a lot longer than the nvidia-glx package from ubuntu
[04:25] <bruenig> DevC, it is off-topic, I don't really care though, just saying.
[04:25] <britt> bimberi, genius!
[04:25] <Jordan_U> noclue: What have you tried?
[04:26] <britt> noclue, what window manager are you using?
[04:26] <britt> Jordan_U, good point
[04:26] <britt> how do i find a listing of my com ports?
[04:26] <Belboz99> anyone know the command to detect USB devices?
[04:27] <grndslm> noclue:  what screen res do you need?
[04:27] <noclue> jordan_u i have tried the whole of the listed script on ubuntu help
[04:27] <grndslm> but what resolution do you want it to be?
[04:27] <Flannel> poolkey172: go to help.ubuntu.com (and/or wiki.ubuntu.com) and search for RAID stuff (the factoid has crappy links) :  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LVMOnRaid for instance
[04:27] <grndslm> what kinda monitor do you have?
[04:28] <noclue> grndslm i  need 1260 x something i aint sure what the exact numbers are lol
[04:28] <poolkey172> ok flannel will do now
[04:28] <grndslm> noclue: is this a laptop or something?
[04:28] <grndslm> or lcd?
[04:28] <noclue> grndslm i have a packard bell crt
[04:28] <noclue> 17"
[04:28] <jbroome> 1280x1024?
[04:28] <grndslm> yea...
[04:28] <fr500_> hmmm
[04:28] <DevC> I'm aware of the other ubuntu channels but one can assert that you do care because you wasted your time typing that while everyone else that truly didn' t care just ignored it and went about their problem ;) j/p waiting on this upgrade so I can reboot and see if it messes up on me
[04:28] <britt> bimberi, doesnt exist
[04:28] <grndslm> noclue: have you edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:28] <noclue> jbroome yes that one
[04:28] <fr500_> edgy seems more unstable than any other version for me :(
[04:28] <poolkey172> DOH flannel I have been there over the past few days already and see my same questions unanswered :o
[04:29] <poolkey172> looks at the LVM linky
[04:29] <noclue> grndslm i dont think so
[04:29] <grndslm> noclue:  actually...i think that:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    should do the trick
[04:29] <bimberi> britt: ah yes, won't be on edgy, hmm
[04:29] <poolkey172> brb
[04:29] <noclue> grndslm just tried it said permission denied
[04:29] <noclue> lol
[04:29] <logick> can anyone direct me to a channel that could help me troubleshoot a problem with the mplayer firefox plugin?
[04:30] <britt> bimberi, although it was on sarge
[04:30] <britt> intresting
[04:30] <sigp239> okay so my system locks up with the nvidia driver...
[04:30] <DevC> fr500_: depends on hardware mostly...may just mean that edgy is having issues with your hardware....then it could just be something that the team is addressing now
[04:30] <Arrick> bimberi how have you been, long time no see
[04:30] <bimberi> britt: edgy uses upstart (not init)
[04:30] <fr500> DevC: i figure, still it's a bit annoying
[04:31] <bimberi> hey Arrick :)
[04:31] <funkja> Is there a way to get root file access in Nautilus?
[04:31] <bruenig> funkja, gksudo nautilus
[04:31] <fr500_> DevC: and the totem bugs.....they are even funny :D
[04:31] <Madpilot> funkja, you can launch it w/ gksudo, but be very, very careful
[04:31] <Arrick> bimberi I have a box that has had breezy on it for 2 months without having to take it down for any reason woohooo
[04:31] <Arrick> got my two bots on it too
[04:31] <britt> bimberi, lucky me :/
[04:31] <bruenig> ah careful smareful, just fling those files around where you think fit
[04:31] <DevC> yeah no doubt... that is why for windows (requird for college course BS in GSP) i went from 95/98 to XPsp2 for the fact that they were unstable now I do my programming on Ubuntu and my course work on Xp
[04:32] <grndslm> noclue:  you typed sudo too?
[04:32] <grndslm> and the right password?
[04:32] <bimberi> Arrick: only 2 months ;)
[04:32] <Arrick> I just have to figure out the command for sending a pm to someone
[04:32] <funkja> How is gksudo different from sudo?
[04:32] <Arrick> bimberi just installed it
[04:32] <Arrick> lo
[04:32] <bimberi> !gksudo | funkja
[04:32] <ubotu> funkja: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use gksudo, as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using "sudo <GUI-application>"
[04:32] <Arrick> lol
[04:33] <funkja> hm,, intresting. Thanks
[04:33] <DevC> I was mad I tried to upgrade to 6.06 and when I did xserver wouldn't configure properly so I had to reinstall 5.04 and try again and pray that xserver doesn't mess up again on 6.06
[04:33] <noclue> grndslm just came up with setup 90% i didn't understand
[04:34] <noclue> lol
[04:34] <Flannel> DevC: You need to upgrade to 5.10 before going to 6.06, that's probably why.
[04:34] <bruenig> DevC, always a good idea to burn the iso of the newest version before you update if you can also
=== [1] CaptainMorgan is now known as CaptainMorgan
[04:34] <fr500_> wow the new BMPX is great
[04:34] <Flannel> DevC: although, if you're on a fresh install of 5.04, you might as well just do a fresh install of 6.06
[04:34] <sigp239> why does my system lockup anytime I install nvidia drivers?  the only nvidia drivers that don't lockup are debian STABLE
[04:35] <DevC> flannel: I did have it to 5.10 that is why I'm mad because now I have to do the whole process over again 5.04 -> 5.10 -> 6.06 -> 6.10
[04:35] <bimberi> britt: hrm, can't see it on my edgy install.  Dapper's inittab includes some sample lines: "/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100".  Give that a try.
[04:35] <noclue> grndslm can you give me a little more in depth help with this?
[04:35] <Flannel> DevC: why not just download a 6.10 CD?
[04:35] <maxxism> Picasa 2 just crashed trying import pictures from my Canon SD400.  gnome's little camera importer started when I plugged in the camera. and imported the pics with now problem.  score one for gnome.org

[04:35] <britt> bimberi, apparently there's a dir called event.d
[04:35] <britt> the tty's are listed there
[04:35] <britt> 1-6
[04:35] <Madpilot> atroWork, ??
[04:35] <nalioth> atroWork: yes?
[04:35] <maxxism> i meant no problems.
[04:35] <maxxism> hehe
[04:35] <britt> but i dont know how to spawn a console on a com port
[04:35] <bimberi> britt: ah
[04:36] <DevC> Flannel: well I can't burn the iso no more room on my laptop to d/l and burn ISO....all my MS/Macromedia/adobe  software for my college course has filled up my entire 60 gig hdd
[04:36] <atroWork> Madpilot, nalioth, _alice is sending onjoins to a porn site
[04:36] <fr500_> britt: what you trying to do?
[04:36] <Flannel> DevC: heh.  Grab the small (<10Mb) netinstall CD then.
[04:36] <atroWork> and there she goes, thanks.
[04:36] <britt> sorry for the scrolling, anyway I bought a WYSE terminal. the rest is kinda self-explainatory
[04:37] <korupt> does anyone know how to remove the network mounts icons from the desktop?
[04:37] <Flannel> DevC: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ 8.4Mb, surely you can find room for that ;)  It'll save you about 3Gb of downloading too ;)
[04:37] <fr500_> britt: i don't really know what that is, sorry, but when i need access to terminals, i use gnome-terminal, not sure if that's useful
[04:37] <sigp239> why does my system lockup anytime I install nvidia drivers?  the only nvidia drivers that don't lockup are debian STABLE
[04:37] <eneried> hello everybody? which file determines the font used in tty (terminal)?? I mean pure terminal, not a terminal inside a window in graphic mode, no. I mean using the computer in text mode, which file determine those settings?
[04:37] <Flannel> DevC: or, 1.5Gb, even.  I can add, honest.
[04:38] <MrGiMmE> omg
[04:38] <atroWork> korupt, I believe it's in gconf-editor under apps -> metacity -> desktop. Not sure about specifics but that'll get you in the right direction
[04:38] <MrGiMmE> nobody is ever active in those channels :(
[04:38] <DevC> Flannel: lol I would if I had more than 4MB of space left....I have to put back money to get an external usb HDD in order to save any work I do with my courses right now all my work and stuff is spread across about 40 or 50 floppies right now
[04:38] <eneried> ...
[04:38] <bimberi> britt: I'll pastebin the inittab from my dapper install - it has some sample lines that might be enought hints to make a /etc/event.d/ttyS0
[04:38] <wedderburn> ok question does anyone know how to mount a jfs partition in terminal
[04:39] <britt> fr500_, in essense i have a dumb terminal that connects to a server via a com port
[04:39] <lllloo> hello folk
[04:39] <Flannel> DevC: Uh, if you can't spare 8.4Mb, ... clear your cache or something.  Email a few files to a gmail account or something.
[04:39] <britt> oh S0 = serial port 0
[04:39] <britt> thanks bimberi
[04:39] <Jordan_U> wedderburn: sudo mount -t jfs /dev/partition /mountpoint .
[04:39] <mahuyar> Is there an easier way (or a hidden option) to install Ubuntu from an ftp/http server?  Yes, I've read about Advanced Installation section in ubuntu wiki.  I was thinking something like being able to choose an option, "Install from ftp server", after you boot up the installation cd...  and where I simply need to type in the ip of ftp server...  A similar option/example is available on the installation cd of Fedora...  thank you
[04:39] <wedderburn> Jordan_U: cheers :)
[04:40] <Flannel> mahuyar: a netinstall?  or what?
[04:40] <bimberi> britt: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34460/ (near the bottom)
[04:40] <lllloo> im having a really weird prob with Ubuntu 6.10 it happened once before but reverted back to normal.. once it boots when the splash comes up after the window manager loads it takes a bit to get into the desktop once in the desktop it takes about 20 secs or 15 to open certain parts of the desktop
[04:40] <lllloo> anyone got any suggestions
[04:41] <mahuyar> something like netinstall.  but I was thinking more like just having to put in the ftp server ip at the installation menu ...  and it all starts from there
[04:41] <Flannel> mahuyar: there's a CD available, or you can do the netboot sort of thing : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot  s/Netboot/MinimalCD/ for the CD iso link
[04:41] <logick> anyone know why mplayer plugin would only play once on a website then stop?
[04:41] <fr500_> britt: what about gnome-terminal, wont work?
[04:41] <Flannel> mahuyar: you might be interested in the 8.4MB mini CD then.  It'll download everything from the servers, etc.
[04:41] <Flannel> mahuyar: the difference between the usage of the two is whether you have a CDrom, etc.
[04:42] <lllloo> im having a really weird prob with Ubuntu 6.10 it happened once before but reverted back to normal.. once it boots when the splash comes up after the window manager loads it takes a bit to get into the desktop once in the desktop it takes about 20 secs or 15 to open certain parts of the desktop
[04:42] <DevC> Flannel: XP is requied by my college (anti-linux) so ubuntu is only for me to bone up on my php/mysql web dev and c/c++ programming while I do everything else on xp.....when I get the external HDD (plan to get an 80 gig or higher) I plan to copy most of the stuff to the external so I can use it anywhere until then I'm just going to do it throug the uncertain upgrade methods the site outlines
[04:42] <lllloo> any suggestions
[04:42] <Flannel> DevC: er... So, where is ubuntu installed currently then?
[04:43] <Jordan_U> Ubuntu / gnome thinks that I am connected to power when I am running on battery.
[04:43] <DevC> ubuntu is my Main OS on my desktop while xp is my main os on my laptop
[04:43] <britt> bimberi, ttyS0 (start) running, process 11088 active

[04:43] <sigp239> should i just give up on getting the nvidia driver to work at all????
[04:43] <bimberi> britt: i don't know sorry, I've never done it.  I'm making educated guesses.  Looks promising though :)
[04:44] <mahuyar> @Flannel:  Thank u.  I'll look into the mini cd.  My laptop doesn't have the cd-rom built-in.  However, I have a usb cd that I can boot with.  But it took forever to install since the laptop only supports only usb ver 1.
[04:44] <britt> bimberi, i appreciate your help :)
[04:44] <Flannel> DevC: so, can't you download the CD to your desktop? and install it there?  I'm... confused.  Can't you transfer a file or two to your desktop to download 9mbs worth of CD?
[04:44] <cong0_natty> hey any of you guys good with dd?
[04:44] <lllloo> sigp239 what kinda prob u having
[04:44] <cong0_natty> i need to know how to skip unused blocks with dd
[04:44] <Flannel> mahuyar: yeah, it's only 8mb to read, the rest is all webbased.
[04:44] <cong0_natty> so im not backing up blank space
[04:44] <britt> thank you all for your help, thanks to each of you all, i havent used windows one bit in over two years
[04:44] <slowz3r> can someone recomend a Wifi signal viewer that displays signal strength an waht not ??
[04:44] <atroWork> cong0_natty, I don't think you can. Look into a program called partimage though
[04:45] <Jordan_U> slowz3r: Network-manager-gnome
[04:45] <Nerd42> Hey everybody
[04:45] <cong0_natty> cool thanks atroWork
[04:45] <Nerd42> Um, I have this laptop that I bought from some guy that has ubuntu on it
[04:45] <slowz3r> Jordan_U, i use that but it doesnt display like the signal strength
[04:45] <sigp239> lllloo:  I've tried fedora core 6 with the nvidia driver and my system locks up.  I've tried ubuntu 6.10 with the nvidia driver and my system locks up.  I've tried ubuntu 6.10 with the driver from www.nvidia.com and my system locks up.  The only time my system doesn't lock up is when I use the regular nv driver, or when I use debian stable with the nvidia driver.
[04:45] <Nerd42> and its asking me for a password
[04:45] <bimberi> britt: cool!  can't say the same here (kids want to play games that need shockwave :/ )
[04:45] <slowz3r> Jordan_U, it has blue bars but what the hell does that mean
[04:46] <Jordan_U> slowz3r: The more bars the better the signal.
[04:46] <Nerd42> how do i either wipe the drive and start over or else figure out what the password is??
[04:46] <DevC> I could download the new cd on my desktop and put it on my desktop but I have no burner on it and I found that xp and linux don't get a long when it comes to transferring files either by disc or network....when it goes linux and back to xp it get corrupted and can't be used for some reason
[04:46] <britt> bimberi, i have a mythtv box with 320GBs of video space, a ibook with edgy ubuntu
[04:46] <Naik0> Hey i have an question
[04:46] <Jordan_U> slowz3r: And when you click on it it gives you a lager set of bars for other available networks
[04:46] <britt> and several old apples
[04:46] <britt> :)
[04:46] <Flannel> Nerd42: wiping the drive isthrough the usual methods.  You can't figure out the old password, but you can set it to something, see this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword
[04:46] <bimberi> :)
[04:46] <atroWork> I'm trying to get sendmail to work locally in order for php to send out some emails. I want it to listen only on the loopback interface (working), but it appears to be attempting to send out on the wrong interface (the local network one, instead of the world accessible one). Does anybody know where in the configurations I can bind an outgoing interface?
[04:46] <slowz3r> Jordan_U, ok like ill click on the icon in my system tray and it lists all the connections and next to them is like a solid blue bar
[04:46] <eneried> which file is used to configure tty?
[04:46] <Naik0> i installe kubuntu now, and i use oem as user, what do i write in term? to create new acc
[04:47] <Nerd42> oh man, ditch the old password lol :)
[04:47] <Nerd42> Um, so far as "usual methods" go
[04:47] <Nerd42> I'm a PC user
[04:47] <Nerd42> and this is a mac laptop
[04:47] <slowz3r> Jordan_U, u know what im talkin about ?
[04:47] <Nerd42> That i'm trying to put linux on
[04:47] <Nerd42> so i have no idea what i'm takling about or doing heh ...
[04:48] <britt> Nerd42, what mac?
[04:48] <britt> old or new?
[04:48] <Nerd42> um
[04:48] <Nerd42> its an ibook g3 laptop
[04:48] <britt> what color is the keyboard
[04:48] <Flannel> Nerd42: gparted/qtparted/fdisk/whatever (installation disk will do it for you)
[04:48] <Nerd42> white
[04:48] <Nerd42> oh
[04:48] <slowz3r> Jordan_U, u dont have any idea what im talkin about do u ..lol
[04:48] <britt> should be pretty straightforward
[04:48] <Nerd42> ok so all i have to do is put an ubuntu CD in the drive and boot then eh?
[04:49] <britt> Nerd42, yes
[04:49] <Nerd42> k cool
[04:49] <Nerd42> i think i'll go that route
[04:49] <britt> press power, and hold the C key to boot from CD if you need to
[04:49] <Nerd42> oh
[04:49] <Nerd42> ok
[04:49] <Flannel> Nerd42: you want the PPC CD.
[04:49] <britt> Ubuntu Desktop CD should be good
[04:49] <britt> yes
[04:49] <Nerd42> the "PPC" cd ?
[04:49] <britt> You'll see it
[04:49] <Nerd42> ok
[04:49] <LordOllie> is there some reason kopete doesn't show all my MSN contacts?
[04:49] <britt> PPC = PowerPC
[04:49] <Nerd42> there might be a linux cd in the drive
[04:49] <Nerd42> i think that's what the guy said
[04:50] <Nerd42> i'll have to look :)
[04:50] <Nerd42> ah thanks britt
[04:50] <Nerd42>  i didn't know that :)
[04:50] <TERRYqetew> hi ,i installed ubuntu6.10 , and my video card is radeon mobility9600 ,setup program can recongize the card, but i wonder if i need to intall the new driver from ate offical site
[04:50] <slowz3r> anyone have a good program that they use that locates and displays the signal strenght of wifi conections
[04:50] <Naik0> Hi, i have a question
[04:51] <Naik0> i installed ubuntu now and i use oem as user, i forgatt what i write in the term to create new account
[04:51] <aphixe> Simple question where can I change desktop resolution in gnome+ Ubuntu, I check menu's and don't know
[04:51] <atroWork> slowz3r, gnome-network-manager, gtkwifi, wifi-radar. Lots of options out there, my favorite is gnome-network-manager
[04:51] <atroWork> aphixe, System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution
[04:52] <sigp239> why the heck doesn't the nvidia driver work/
[04:52] <Nerd42> lol in order to get my computers working
[04:52] <Nerd42> i' am having to work through a complex maze involving three machines, each of which has fatal flaws
[04:52] <LordOllie> atrowork: got any idea about kopete?
[04:52] <Flannel> Naik0: sudo oem-config-prepare  (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview)
[04:52] <slowz3r> atroWork, correct me if im wrong network manager is the one that sits in ur system tray an when u click on it a like dropdown menu shows all the connection names an has a blue bare next to them
[04:52] <aphixe> atroWork: oh my gosh I can't believe I didnt see it, lol
[04:52] <mwalling> slackware
[04:52] <Nerd42> the one i'm chatting on now runs windows xp and has a bad video card
[04:52] <atroWork> TERRYqetew, if it's working you shouldn't need any other drivers. There may however be options to install third party drivers that support better 3D acceleration
[04:52] <noclue> I can not get this stupid monitor to work as it should and it's driving me mad
[04:53] <mwalling> !slackware
[04:53] <UnNaturalHigh> Hi, I am a gentoo user but I am going to install ubuntu on one my my buddies computers. Which would be the best one to put on his computer Ubuntu 6.10 or Ubuntu 6.06 w/ LTS?
[04:53] <Nerd42> my main desktop has a bad network card that i'm trying to replace, and a bad cd drive
[04:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about slackware - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:53] <manolo> hi
[04:53] <manolo> i started downloading a dvd iso with jigdo (200 mb), but i want to download the cd iso instead, can i use the iso.tmp from the dvd so i wont start from 0?
[04:53] <AnthonyG> Hello everyone :D
[04:53] <atroWork> LordOllie, what about kopete?
[04:53] <noclue> i didn't have a problem on my last installation of 6.06lts everything worked fine
[04:53] <UnNaturalHigh> manolo, no
[04:53] <noclue> help!!!
[04:53] <Nerd42> so to get teh drivers onto it for a new network card i had to make an image of the drivers CD and carry that image across on USB lol
[04:53] <rc-1> is there a channel for ktorrent?
[04:54] <Nerd42> after i do that ... then i can work on gettig linux on the laptop hahaha i am piled with stuff to do here haha
[04:54] <LordOllie> atrowork: I only have like 6 of 50 contacts, that I should have and it says no one is online which I know is false because I just called one of them and asked
[04:54] <AnthonyG> Good news , I got the SmartLink drivers loaded :D
[04:54] <AnthonyG> No packages broken! :)
[04:54] <atroWork> UnNaturalHigh, I use 6.06 for my server machine and 6.10 for all my others. If they'll be upgrading along with the releases go for Edgy. If they care about commercial support, go for Dapper.
[04:54] <LordOllie> atrowork: msn contacts
[04:54] <Flannel> manolo: no, theyre different ISOs
[04:54] <UnNaturalHigh> atroWork, perfect thx bud :)
[04:54] <bird603568> whats ubuntu have over slackware?
[04:54] <slowz3r> anyone please help me set up Ndiswrapper ? please
[04:54] <sanityx> bird603568, Package management that doesn't suck.
[04:54] <UnNaturalHigh> slackware is tried and tested distro
[04:54] <manolo> damn, thx man
[04:55] <sigp239> does anyone have a GeForce 6800 GT with the ubuntu 6.10 nvidia-glx drivers installed and working?
[04:55] <atroWork> LordOllie, sorry, I had no problems with kopete but preferred gaim's features. Have you tried gaim to see if it has problems importing contacts?
[04:55] <UnNaturalHigh> slackware = old school w/ some hardcore geek mixed in
[04:55] <sanityx> bird603568, But slackware is the most stable distro I've ever used
[04:55] <LordOllie> atrowork: I thought about gaim or amsn, was just looking to see if it was something obvious
[04:56] <UnNaturalHigh> essentially both are binary distro's that use pre-packaged files to distributes programs but slackware uses a philosophy similar to FreeBSD that everything that goes in is guaranteed stable
[04:56] <slowz3r> anyone please help me set up Ndiswrapper ? please
[04:56] <atroWork> LordOllie, I doubt it is. kopete "just worked" for me, but lacked key features like file transfers across all media
[04:56] <UnNaturalHigh> bird603568, in the end its up to the user what they choose to use
[04:56] <fulld> can I find my RAM clock speed without opening my computer?
[04:56] <TERRYqetew> atroWork, thanks
[04:56] <sanityx> fulld, from your bios probably
[04:56] <rc-1> after a systemcrash (storm) ktorrent says it cant connect to klauncher, ideas? (it opens but closes wrong and wont connect to peers
[04:56] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, have you got your windows network driver yet?
[04:57] <noclue> what do you need to do to get some good help in here ??? lol
[04:57] <LordOllie> atrowork: so I have to get the Gaim 1.5.0 source then?
[04:57] <Nerd42> oh now i have a prompt on the laptop
[04:57] <Nerd42> it says "welcome to ubuntu 1.3.13
[04:57] <atroWork> rc-1, try running it from a terminal to see the debug output. Information there might lead you in the right direction
[04:57] <fulld> sanityx: sweeth, thanks
[04:57] <rc-1> atroWork, k will try ty
[04:57] <atroWork> noclue, you need patience and a well-stated problem description ;)
[04:58] <grndslm> best torrent manager everybody?
[04:58] <sanityx> Nerd42, 1.3.13?
[04:58] <grndslm> ktorrent?
[04:58] <UnNaturalHigh> noclue, ask a question
[04:58] <cellofellow> anybody know a good GTK+2 (not GNOME) Jabber client? GTalk compatible?
[04:58] <sanityx> Nerd42, . . . why?
[04:58] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, i have the driver the is on the disk that came with the antena
[04:58] <Nerd42> er ... thats what it says
[04:58] <noclue> is there just a package i can install to fix my screen res?
[04:58] <sanityx> cellofellow, meebo.com :-D
[04:58] <Dominian> Ok, I have a true ubuntu-noob question for y'all.. I'm an avid slackware user.. my wife.. runs Windows XP... how easy do you think it would be for her to integrate her life style from Windows XP into ubuntu if she were given the chance?
[04:58] <sanityx> noclue, dpkg-config xserver-xorg
[04:58] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, look for the driver that is for network that is *.inf (* = something related to your network drivers name)
[04:58] <atroWork> noclue, what's wrong with your screen resolution? It's more likely a configuration problem than lacking a package
[04:58] <sanityx> noclue, you also need to throw a flag in to force it to reconfigure but i dont  remember which
[04:59] <DevC> this is new to me....I did the upgrade for 5.04 to 5.10 and now there is a black screen with a yellow ubuntu and load bar with the loading it is doing...that wasn't there last night when I upgraded :o
[04:59] <CSonicGo> yeah its cool
[04:59] <CSonicGo> :D
[04:59] <atroWork> Dominian, it really depends on her computer life-style. How advanced are her computer uses, how patient is she about change, etc?
[04:59] <sanityx> Nerd42, whatever problem your having would likely be solved by using 6.06 or 6.10
[04:59] <Dominian> atroWork: When it comes to computers.. some-what paitent.. usually uses it to play some games and check email
[04:59] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, on the CD their is the autorun.inf
[04:59] <sanityx> Nerd42, what is the problem anyway
[05:00] <atroWork> Dominian, what kinds of games?
[05:00] <noclue> atrowork my screen resolution is stuck at 2 options 800 x 600 and 600 x 400 but i had it running before re-install at 1240 x somthing
[05:00] <DevC> well the 5.10 upgrade took affect.....hopefully going to 6.06 will take effect after I do the upgrades
[05:00] <DevC> err updates for 5.10 like the site recommends
[05:00] <atroWork> noclue, try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver' first. If that doesn't work you may need to play with your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
[05:00] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, do you know how to use command line?
[05:01] <xeon111> how do i uninstal ubuntu
[05:01] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, im rele nub u think u can walk me through it a bit ?
[05:01] <Dominian> xeon111: insert a windows disk
[05:01] <xeon111> btw i have a windows os
[05:01] <Dominian> xeon111: just reformat it
[05:01] <xeon111> ok how do i cahnge my first boot thing
[05:01] <xeon111> cuz i think my first boot is grub
[05:01] <Dominian> xeon111: what's the boot manager as of now?
[05:02] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, sure....look around the disk some more....do you know what your network card is called?
[05:02] <noclue> atrowork : xorg-xserver' is not installed and no info is available. what does that mean?
[05:02] <sigp239> forget this crap---ubuntu, fedora---I'm going back to DEBIAN STABLE where at least things WORK
[05:02] <atroWork> xeon111, use your windows CD and choose repair installation. You need to repair the master boot record, that option is somewhere on the windows cd
[05:02] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, its not a card
[05:02] <sanityx> noclue, it means that you dont have x installed somehow . . .
[05:02] <xeon111> grub is the boot manager
[05:02] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, its a Hawking external USB antenna
[05:02] <sanityx> noclue, actually it might be xserver-xorg
[05:02] <noclue> sanityx oh how do i get it?
[05:02] <sanityx> instead of xorg-xserver
[05:02] <Jordan_U> atroWork: xserver-xorg
[05:02] <mwalling> xeon111: the windows install will fix it if you say repair installation
[05:02] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, go to there website and find the driver and tell me the link to it
[05:02] <AnthonyG> atroWork: Repair you say? GRUB damages it in some way?
[05:02] <mwalling> see above
[05:02] <sanityx> noclue if you have a GUI you have xorg. try xserver-xorg instead
[05:03] <xeon111> hmmn ill try that
[05:03] <atroWork> noclue, it means I reversed the package name, oops
=== Nerd42 is now known as Noob42

[05:04] <Jordan_U> noclue: What kind of card do you have, if ATI or Nvidia have you installed thier drivers?
[05:04] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, fuck that things huge, lol
[05:04] <Flannel> !language | UnNaturalHigh
[05:04] <ubotu> UnNaturalHigh: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[05:04] <xeon111> im going to format the disk on my ubuntu
[05:04] <sanityx> Jordan_U, you dont need to install the ati/nvidia binary drivers
[05:04] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh,  not rele it fits in my palm
[05:04] <atroWork> AnthonyG, no grub doesn't damage the MBR, grub writes itself to the MBR. If you want to get rid of a linux partition and only need to boot to windows you can use the windows CD to restore the windows MBR
[05:04] <xeon111> !uninstall|ubuntu
[05:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uninstall - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:04] <noclue> jordan_u it is an onboard sis driver and it is recognising it as far as i can see
[05:04] <AnthonyG> atroWork: That makes more sense :)
[05:05] <Dominian> ubuntu have a live cd..?
[05:05] <atroWork> noclue, try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' (I just reversed the name of the package on accident). Do you know how to open a terminal and run commands like that?
[05:05] <Jordan_U> sanityx: But most "resolution problems" are because the open source drivers don't properly support the card.
[05:05] <sanityx> Dominian, Ubuntu is a live cd.
[05:05] <Dominian> Plust I'm compiling a new kernel on this laptop
[05:05] <AnthonyG> Dominian: Yes , It is...
[05:05] <Dominian> sanityx: oh?
[05:05] <Dominian> I see..
[05:05] <sanityx> Jordan_U, Most resolution problems are an improperly configured xorg.conf file.
[05:05] <noclue> atrowork yes i do hold on i will try it
[05:05] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, well it seems to be bundled as a .exe so I will extract the driver for you and post it for you to download
[05:05] <Dominian> live cd that can install to harddrive like slax or knoppix?
[05:05] <sanityx> Dominian, Kind of, except that its actually MEANT to be installed.
[05:06] <Dominian> sanityx: ahh ok
[05:06] <sanityx> Dominian, It just comes in live cd form so you can test it out.
[05:06] <Dominian> sanityx: nice
[05:06] <amileft> I moved my sh from CentOS to Ubuntu. But I failed. I really want to keep use Ubuntu. But I can not fix my problem
[05:06] <atroWork> Dominian, yup, there's an install program on the desktop once you boot into it. There's an alternate install cd that installs in text mode if you prefer
[05:06] <sanityx> Dominian, i.e. the installer runs off the live cd. but its a full desktop distrobution. the most popular one currently in fact.
[05:06] <AnthonyG> Dominian: But the LiveCD mode causes great slowdown
[05:06] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, ok...thanks ur prolly the only person who has help[ed me this much everyone else linked me to the damn forum
[05:06] <maynoth> wow
[05:06] <noclue> atrowork i have been though this blue menu of options about 3 times now i don't think i am doing the right things to it???
[05:06] <maynoth> I just finished tweaking my ubuntu box
[05:06] <Dominian> sanityx: No offense, but popularity means nothing to me ... usability does.
[05:06] <maynoth> added neroliux
[05:07] <maynoth> I must say you guys have made a very usable desktop
[05:07] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, my suggestion would be to get a little dirty with the command line in the future
[05:07] <Dominian> sanityx: as a systems administrator... usability counts for greater than popularity
[05:07] <maynoth> I think in 5 years it will be on par with windows
[05:07] <TheManiacKY> OKay. I have really in need of help. I think I might have been hacked some how for none of my logins work to get into my Ubuntu server. I pulled the hard drive and am copying the data I need off the drive now. I was thinking maybe if I could edit the /etc/passwd file and on the root line change the root:x: to root:*: do you think this will allow me to login without a password?
[05:07] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, it may seem hard and somewhat stupid at first but it is more powerful then any GUI you will ever use
[05:07] <Dominian> maynoth: that's a bold statement
[05:07] <sanityx> Dominian, Why do you think its so popular?
[05:07] <maxxism> I love that whilst installing ubuntu,  you can browse the web or do anything you normally could do on your desktop.   beauty!!!
[05:07] <Dominian> sanityx: Frankly, I don't care, honestly.
[05:07] <maynoth> you dont think so dominian
[05:07] <maynoth> ?
[05:07] <sanityx> Dominian, Best hardware detection of any distro ive ever tried.
[05:08] <Dominian> maynoth: 5 years is a broad perspective to take
[05:08] <maynoth> well ok
[05:08] <Dominian> sanityx: slax does quite well
[05:08] <maynoth> maybe 10
[05:08] <maxxism> sanityx agreed
[05:08] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, i used to be pretty proficcient with the command line ive been out of a comp for about 8 months since both of my rigs went tdown
[05:08] <noclue> atrowork it has asked me for video card's bus identifier what do i put there?
[05:08] <sanityx> Dominian, Yup it does. But not as well as ubuntu.
[05:08] <Dominian> sanityx: gentoo detects perfectly
[05:08] <lllloo> im having a really weird prob with Ubuntu 6.10 it happened once before but reverted back to normal.. once it boots when the splash comes up after the window manager loads it takes a bit to get into the desktop once in the desktop it takes about 20 secs or 15 to open certain parts of the desktop
[05:08] <maynoth> I think ubuntu will be the defacto OS in 5 years
[05:08] <sanityx> Dominian, All distros detect perfectly on SOME systems.
[05:08] <maynoth> but thats just IMHO
[05:08] <Dominian> slamd64/slackware detects all of my hardware in this alienware... so.. I still don't see your point.
[05:08] <metatecque> very usable but - there is always a problem I can bring here - I can't burn CD's - with any program -k3b won't see the hardware and CD Writer in gnome won't initalize the disk
[05:09] <maynoth> K3b sucks use nerolinux
[05:09] <maxxism> maynoth  sorry man.  I love ubuntu but OSX is 5 years from now.
[05:09] <metatecque> is that in universe
[05:09] <sanityx> Dominian, Slackware doesnt auomatically configure nearly as much as ubuntu.
[05:09] <Dominian> metatecque: did you run k3bsetup?
[05:09] <MBohrer14> is there a site where you can't find compatible laptops?  I have a HP dv6000t  and just wanted to make sure that before I wipe everything that i'm not starting a cursade against edgy
[05:09] <metatecque> oh
[05:09] <Dominian> sanityx: no, but I know how to configure my hardware via slackware.. so that doesn't impress me
[05:09] <maynoth> I dont understand what you mean maxxism
[05:09] <aphixe> whats the command to see which kernel version you have
[05:09] <maynoth> anyone here good with WINE?
[05:09] <maynoth> I have a weird question
[05:09] <lllloo> im having a really weird prob with Ubuntu 6.10 it happened once before but reverted back to normal.. once it boots when the splash comes up after the window manager loads it takes a bit to get into the desktop once in the desktop it takes about 20 secs or 15 to open certain parts of the desktop
[05:09] <sanityx> Dominian, the fact that you know how isnt the point. you asked about usability. thats usability
[05:09] <Dominian> aphixe: uname -a
[05:09] <sanityx> it just works.
[05:10] <DevC> ok moment of truth.....I just edited the breezy to dapper and told it to do the 6.06 LTS upgrade and rebooted it now...Praying it don't crash again
[05:10] <Dominian> sanityx: true
[05:10] <MBohrer14> maynoth, use cedega
[05:10] <maynoth> eww
[05:10] <Dominian> sanityx: but you are trying to convince *me* lol
[05:10] <sanityx> Yes I could write my xorg.conf by hand too. But why should I?
[05:10] <maxxism> maynoth I see Mac OS X as the defacto in 5 years.
[05:10] <maynoth> oooooooh
[05:10] <maxxism> dont get me wrong.  but ubuntu is not a consumer OS yet
[05:10] <lllloo> mac osx blah
[05:10] <maynoth> I would agree if apple would get its head out of its arse
[05:10] <maynoth> open source it
[05:10] <sanityx> maxxism, Agreed. But neither is any linux
[05:10] <maynoth> and make it available for PC
[05:10] <sigp239> does anyone have a GeForce 6800 GT with the ubuntu 6.10 nvidia-glx drivers installed and working?
[05:10] <lllloo> dude
[05:11] <lllloo> i Pm ya
[05:11] <maxxism> I love my ubuntu I have 2 systems running it.  but I loves my mac.
[05:11] <lllloo> what are ya trying to do
[05:11] <Dominian> maxxism: OS X is awesome.
[05:11] <lllloo> sigp239 what are ya trying to do
[05:11] <lllloo> i was out for a few
[05:11] <sanityx> maxkelley, I'd get a mac. But I just bought a laptop the other day for about $1000. The same laptop from apple would  cost me $2500-3000.
[05:12] <sanityx> maxxism* rather
[05:12] <lllloo> i have a 6600gt
[05:12] <Arrick> by who?
[05:12] <UnNaturalHigh> just make your linux feel even better then a mac
[05:12] <lllloo> working with the nvidia drivers
[05:12] <UnNaturalHigh> use e17!
[05:12] <sigp239> lllloo: I'm trying to get the nvidia 3d drivers to work.  whenever I install them, my system locks up.
[05:12] <DevC> I have a 4 gig HDD on my desktop that I was actually planning on using to make a jump into OS dev but with my BS in GSP stuff I've not done it yet just wanting to keep ubuntu up to date right now
[05:12] <lllloo> what versions
[05:12] <maxxism> yes.  my ubuntu is beautiful.  but it could never replace my mac.
[05:12] <sanityx> sigp239, Are you apt-getting the drivers or downloading them from nvidia.
[05:12] <lllloo> easier way
[05:13] <lllloo> get the ENVY script
[05:13] <Dominian> UnNaturalHigh: hehe e17
[05:13] <TheManiacKY> OKay. I have really in need of help. I think I might have been hacked some how for none of my logins work to get into my Ubuntu server. I pulled the hard drive and am copying the data I need off the drive now. I was thinking maybe if I could edit the /etc/passwd file and on the root line change the root:x: to root:*: do you think this will allow me to login without a password?
[05:13] <lllloo> that way itll get all the compilers for ya
[05:13] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, so what am i waiting for again , dont think im tryin to be rushy
[05:13] <sigp239> sanityx: I tried both ways.  both times, my system would lock up roughly about 5 minutes after logon.
[05:13] <maxxism> e17 is pure eye candy.   just gorgeous.
[05:13] <Lovloss> is there anyway to turn off beryl after you've started it up? :)
[05:13] <dennister> ok, real problem i hope to get help with: i think I've got another x-session going that I can't shut down, so my /tmp directory is growing at each reboot instead of being emptied
[05:13] <wedderburn> Jordan_U: i loaded up jfs with sudo modprobe but it still doesn't work
[05:13] <dennister> what to do?
[05:13] <Dominian> TheManiacKY: Ok.. how do you know you were hacked for one.. and you should find out how you were hacked if you were before you move data over
[05:14] <lllloo> remove the nvidia-glx that comes with ubuntu
[05:14] <lllloo> get the envy deb
[05:14] <sanityx> sigp239. yeah you know what, i remember reading about having to disable some specific functions of X to make the driver stable
[05:14] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, sorry, my internet is being slow....I have to many torrents going :)
[05:14] <sanityx> dont remember which though :-(
[05:14] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, oo ohkay no worry take ur time jsut dont forget about me..lol....ohh  bad bad boy torrents huh
[05:14] <maxxism> sigp239 , sanityx is right.
[05:15] <_MMA_> Hey guys. Has anyone else been having alot of problems getting on the forums? I have to hit links twice and refresh pages. Some pages dont fully load.
[05:15] <_MMA_> Actually it seems to happen on alot of the Ubuntu sites. Wiki and such.
[05:15] <Lovloss> I like being able to spin my computer like a cube, but it seems like azeurus wont stay open while its on. i dont want to reboot. surely there's some kind of command line.
[05:15] <lllloo> sigp239 when u install the envy
[05:15] <sigp239> maxxism: is that right?  what do I need to do?
[05:15] <sanityx> sigp239, if you google about getting Xgl working on ubuntu, youll find the info about disabling X functions
[05:15] <lllloo> and update the Xorg
[05:15] <lllloo> the new drivers do lock up
[05:15] <eilker> Lovloss: kill pid
[05:15] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, actually I am downloading ubuntu so I can install it for my buddy tomorrow
[05:15] <lllloo> u especially trying to install gxl
[05:15] <lllloo> and get beryl running
[05:16] <maxxism> sigp239  which are you doing?  installing from nvidia or synaptic?
[05:16] <Lovloss> kill pid?
[05:16] <eilker> Lovloss: ps aux | grep berly
[05:16] <Bacta> hey i just installed ubuntu
[05:16] <sigp239> maxxism: I tried both ways.  Both ways, it crashes.
[05:16] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, ohh well nvm then...good lol
[05:16] <Lovloss> that sounds harsh lol =) will that just turn Beryl off and revert my compy
[05:16] <Bacta> but i was only asked for a password, not a login
[05:16] <Bacta> so whats my login?
[05:16] <eilker> Lovloss: it will give you a number, than write  kill "number"
[05:16] <maxxism> sigp239 are you enabling XGL or just nvidia drivers?
[05:17] <lllloo> with the new drivers u dont need XGL no more
[05:17] <eilker> Lovloss: sudo kill number
[05:17] <sigp239> maxxism: I don't know if I am enabling xgl how do i tell/
[05:17] <lllloo> it makes it embedded within the X server
[05:17] <sanityx> lllloo, Yeah you kinda do.
[05:17] <Bacta> so what is my login???
[05:17] <dennister> these long lags are driving me crazy...is there anything I can do about them?
[05:17] <sanityx> sigp239,  if you dont know, you arent.
[05:17] <sigp239> maxxism: I'm just using a default brand-new fresh install of ubuntu 6.10.
[05:17] <sigp239> when i install nvidia (either synaptic or www.nvidia.com) my system locks up.
[05:17] <Lovloss> um, ok
[05:17] <sanityx> sigp239, enabling xgl is a whole long process. so if you arent sure, chances are you arent enabling it
[05:18] <Bacta> does anyone know? i was only asked for a password during installation, so what do is my username?
[05:18] <dennister> i ask a question and i don't know if anyone's anwered me :( when i log back in, i have no idea if i've missed anything
[05:18] <lllloo> u dont have to enable it anymore
[05:18] <lllloo> the new NVIDIA drivers
[05:18] <lllloo> support it
[05:18] <lllloo> without having to enable XGL
[05:18] <lllloo> its a known fact
[05:18] <eilker> dennister: check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[05:18] <maxxism> sigp239 dont bother with XGL.  sounds like you are just looking to put the nvidia drivers in.
[05:18] <sigp239> well my system does not crash with the nvidia driver on debian stable.
[05:18] <eilker> dennister: for x-session right ?
[05:19] <maxxism> ????
[05:19] <dennister> ok, and what am i looking for/what do i change?
[05:19] <Bacta> does anyone know?
[05:19] <bimberi_> Bacta: what type of install did you do?
[05:19] <sigp239> maxxism:  yes i'm just trying to put the nvidia drivers in
[05:19] <Bacta> a OEM install off the alternative CD
[05:19] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, soo..explain to me breifely what ur going to do with the drivers ?
[05:19] <bimberi_> Bacta: try "oem"
[05:19] <eilker> dennister: EE shows errors in xorg.log
[05:19] <Jordan_U> wedderburn: Does it give an error when you try to mount?
[05:19] <Bacta> oem?
[05:19] <dennister> this konversation lag is what i want to fix first, is that what ur talking about eilker?
[05:20] <Bacta> as the username?
[05:20] <maxxism> sigp239 have you tried to follow the ubuntu guide??   here.   http://ubuntuguide.org
[05:20] <bimberi_> Bacta: yes
[05:20] <Bacta> any other ideas if that won't work?
[05:20] <sigp239> maxxism: no I followed the howto guide
[05:20] <bimberi_> Bacta: boot into recovery mode and look in /etc/passwd
[05:20] <eilker> dennister: nope, i remember your x-session question
[05:20] <Bacta> ok
[05:20] <maxxism> sigp239   so is X just not starting?
[05:20] <dennister> oh, ok...even more important...will check
[05:21] <sigp239> maxxism: X starts and i can login.  but the system locks up after about 2-5 minutes.
[05:21] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, http://72.14.253.104/HWU54D.INI
[05:21] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, save that file
[05:21] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, says not found
[05:21] <maxxism> sigp239  hmmm you sure its nvidia related?
[05:21] <murali> hi
[05:22] <UnNaturalHigh> fuck
[05:22] <UnNaturalHigh> wrong ip
[05:22] <sigp239> maxxism: yes because when I go back to the regular 'nv' drivers, I never get a lockup ever.  It's completely stable.
[05:22] <sanityx> sigp239, If you use the regular non-3d driver your system doesnt lock up?
[05:22] <sanityx> ah
[05:22] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, lol
[05:22] <sigp239> sanityx: that's right.
[05:22] <maxxism> sigp239  ok
[05:22] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, http://70.73.83.214/HWU54D.INI
[05:22] <murali> i am a newbie, can you please help me?
[05:22] <sanityx> sigp239, if nobody can help you here, consider checking #xorg
[05:22] <sanityx> murali, with what?
[05:22] <eilker> murali: just ask
[05:22] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, then --> sudo ndiswrapper -i HWU54D.INI
[05:23] <maxxism> sigp239 hmmm.   check out the readme file on nvidia's website.  i think you may have to comment some line out in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
[05:23] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, sudo ndiswrapper -m
[05:23] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, dmesg
[05:23] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, so type that url in to my browser
[05:23] <UnNaturalHigh> yes
[05:23] <slowz3r> then do that commend
[05:23] <UnNaturalHigh> it should come up as a text file that way
[05:24] <UnNaturalHigh> save it as a file though
[05:24] <dennister> eilker: there seem to be tons of error messages, mostly about fonts
[05:24] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, so just do a file save as in my browser
[05:24] <keeganX> Hi everyone, my alacarte seems not to respond when I click on the check marks.  I ran it in the in the terminal, and I get this error when I try to click on a check mark http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/260248
[05:25] <eilker> dennister: paste here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ may be i can help, may be others
[05:25] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, yes, have you never saved a file before??
[05:25] <dennister> great, will do, and ty in advance
[05:25] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, im not that much of a nub i just dont rele know what uraskin me to do exactly
[05:25] <Amaranth> keeganX: sudo chown -R keegan:keegan ~/.config
[05:25] <r00t_> hello pplz
[05:25] <r00t_> i am new on ubuntu
[05:26] <maxxism> r00t_ welcome.
[05:26] <sigp239> maxxism: I followed the readme.  I removed the line 'dri' and 'GLCore' and made sure that 'glx' was there.
[05:26] <derekS> exit
[05:26] <sanityx> keeganX, sounds like an alacarte bug or something. try apt-get update and then apt-get install alacarte to make sure its the newest version
[05:26] <maxxism> sigp239  and still the same?
[05:26] <Amaranth> sanityx: nope, permission bug
[05:26] <sigp239> maxxism:  yea it locks up after about 5 minutes after logging in.
=== xFordPrefect is now known as FordPrefect
[05:26] <ademan> hey i've noticed that with certain themes (from gnome-look) that things like synaptic and certain administrative programs don't have ANY theme (they default to whatever gtk+'s ugly default rendering is) is this because i didn't install the themes as root? or because of a gtk2 vs gtk1 problem?
[05:26] <maxxism> sigp239  which driver did you use?  the nvidia one?  or the one in synaptic?
[05:26] <sanityx> Amaranth, Oh okay. How do you know? Im not challenging you, im curious.
[05:26] <sigp239> maxxism:  with the ubuntu synaptic nvidia-glx the lockup happens after about 1-2 minutes after logging in.
[05:26] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, ok what do i do after i do dmesg
[05:27] <sanityx> never mind
[05:27] <r00t_> hello pplz , i need help with startup
[05:27] <sanityx> it says permission denied
[05:27] <sanityx> silly me.
[05:27] <Amaranth> ademan: It's not any certain theme, it's any theme installed in your home dir instead of /usr/share/themes
[05:27] <sigp239> maxxism:  either one produces roughly the same effect.  it locks up either within about 1-2 minutes (nvidia-glx) or about 5 minutes (www.nvidia.com driver).
[05:27] <maxxism> sigp239  are you running edgy?
[05:27] <eilker> r00t_: just ask pls
[05:27] <maxxism> sigp239 oh
[05:27] <Amaranth> sanityx: And I'm the alacarte developer ;)
[05:27] <sigp239> maxxism:  I'm running ubuntu 6.10 brand-new fresh install
[05:27] <Noob42> LOL i figured out what i need to do

[05:27] <maxxism> sigp239 which video card you got?
[05:28] <Amaranth> sanityx: yeah
[05:28] <Noob42> wipe out the old OS and start again
[05:28] <r00t_> how can i do it ?
[05:28] <sigp239> maxxism:  GeForce 6800 GT
[05:28] <sanityx> Amaranth, well then let me thank you for making such a great app. now fix it! :-P
[05:28] <maxxism> sigp239  brand?
[05:28] <sigp239> maxxism: Nvidia
[05:28] <keeganX> I uninstalling and reinstalling and that didn't work either
[05:28] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, ??
[05:28] <r00t_> eilker, can you help me with this?
[05:28] <sigp239> maxxism:  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV40 [GeForce 6800 GT]  (rev a1)

[05:30] <sanityx> just kidding.
[05:30] <keeganX> what file do I edit?
[05:30] <maxxism> lol
[05:30] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, does it say anything about your wireless card in dmesg
[05:30] <Amaranth> keeganX: be glad one exists at all, it's a PITA to make it work right :P
[05:30] <Amaranth> keeganX: sudo chown -R keegan:keegan ~/.config
[05:30] <maxxism> vi!! vi!!
[05:30] <sanityx> keeganX, I have no idea. That was kind of a joke. But Amaranth knows im sure.
[05:31] <maxxism> sigp239   sorry man i am at a loss.
[05:31] <eilker> r00t_: i dont remember exactly place, but from system menu u could add it in start up easily, kubuntu here, i cant check place sorry
[05:31] <Lovloss> How good is the directx patch for Wine? does anyone know?
[05:31] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, is their any line i shuld be looking for specificaly to see if it worked or not ?
[05:31] <sanityx> Amaranth, Yeah. I'm curious, why is Alacarte so slow? I dont mean that as a criticism, I'm sure its just some techincal limitation. But nontheless, how come?
[05:31] <maxxism> sigp239  i have never really had any problems similar to this on nvidia.
[05:31] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, i see this """"[17294919.088000]  usb 4-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 8
[05:31] <slowz3r> """"
[05:31] <dabaR> r00t_: yuo want to have a command ran at boot up? add it to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
[05:31] <Amaranth> sanityx: it shouldn't be in edgy
[05:31] <r00t_> hello any body here who can help me with statup. (i mean to say i want to add a Terminal command to statup (start with ubuntu automatic ))
[05:31] <sigp239> maxxism:  okay.  I'm going to try the nvidia beta drivers now.
[05:31] <maxxism> sigp239  at least nothing i had didnt produce by missing something.
[05:32] <Amaranth> sanityx: loads in about 1 second on my (admittedly high-end) computer
[05:32] <sanityx> Amaranth, I havent used 6.10 that much. I'll check it out once i get my new laptop tomorrow
[05:32] <r00t_> dabaR,  Thank you :D
[05:32] <dabaR> r00t_: you are welcome
[05:32] <Amaranth> sanityx: 6.06 was dog-slow because of the effort involved in reading the entire menu
[05:32] <maxxism> sigp239  good idea.  sometimes beta = better
[05:32] <sanityx> Amaranth, Yeah it loads fine. But the response times are slow while its running.
[05:32] <maynoth> i need some help
[05:32] <TokenBad> man no one seems to know what is going on with my ftp
[05:32] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, no idea, what it would say, probably something with ndiswrapper in it
[05:32] <sanityx> Amaranth, So what changed in 6.10?
[05:32] <Amaranth> sanityx: oh, right
[05:32] <sigp239> maxxism: do I have to do anything to uninstall the driver from www.nvidia.com /
[05:32] <maynoth> can anyone here tell me how to convert source to a .deb file?
[05:32] <dabaR> sanityx: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[05:32] <maxxism> sigp239  i doubt it.  the new will probably just overlap the other.
[05:32] <TokenBad> I have checked on forums, proftpd channel and other computer techs...and no one seems to know
[05:32] <r00t_> dabaR,  can i pm you plz :)
[05:33] <dennister> test lag
[05:33] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, hmmm
[05:33] <Amaranth> sanityx: I removed the nasty hacks that made it appear instant. In 6.06 it would pretend something happened and actually do it slightly later. In 6.10 it waits for the menu to say "this changed".
[05:33] <dabaR> r00t_: rather no
[05:33] <Lovloss> ok i have another big question... my girlfriend has ubuntu but she wants to view some movies at thai.tv, and on most computers only IE seems to run it. Some sort of plugin. It is on a network called "iptv" sites... it doesnt mention what plugins you need though. Any pointers for me?
[05:33] <lightspeedbiker> Question; How do I recover a lost SSH password?  I'm using ssh username:remoteaddress  ??
[05:33] <sanityx> Amaranth, Why doesnt that make it even slower?
[05:33] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh,  this cant be good ""[17343529.400000]  ndiswrapper (wrapper_init:136): ndiswrapper: initialization failed
[05:33] <slowz3r> "'
[05:33] <dabaR> r00t_: you are welcome to speak with me in the channel
[05:33] <eilker> tokenbad: i have ftp too, with vsftpd
[05:33] <Amaranth> sanityx: eh?
[05:33] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, nope, thats not good
[05:33] <sanityx> If its waiting now, shouldnt it feel slower?
[05:33] <r00t_> dabaR, i dont know what i have to add there
[05:33] <Amaranth> sanityx: It does?
[05:34] <sanityx> No
[05:34] <sanityx> Im asking
[05:34] <r00t_> plesae give me a command :S
[05:34] <dabaR> r00t_: what are you trying to do?
[05:34] <TokenBad> eilker, I am trying through proftpd....
[05:34] <UnNaturalHigh> slowz3r, looks like your going to have to search the forums
[05:34] <Amaranth> sanityx: 6.10 starts faster but takes longer to show changes you've made
[05:34] <slowz3r> UnNaturalHigh, argzorz alright..well thanks for all ur help
[05:34] <sanityx> Amaranth, Ah ok. I get it.
[05:34] <eilker> tokenbad: there are many topics in buntuforums , did u check it ?
[05:34] <dabaR> r00t_: if you want to run ls at startup, you just add ls to the end of the file.
[05:34] <r00t_> dabaR, i want to auto start eggdrop
[05:35] <TokenBad> eilker, well I checked with proftpd people...and they don't seem to understand what is going on...
[05:35] <dabaR> r00t_: how do you manually start it?
[05:35] <r00t_> ook wait a min
[05:35] <eilker> tokenbad: what was your problem ?
[05:35] <dennister> eilker: sorry, couldn't get out of lag
[05:35] <maynoth> hello
[05:35] <r00t_> dabaR, r00t@r00t-server:~$ cd /home/r00t/Desktop/eggdrop1.6.18
[05:35] <r00t_> r00t@r00t-server:~/Desktop/eggdrop1.6.18$ ./eggdrop -m eggdrop.conf
[05:35] <maynoth> can someone show me a tutorial on how to compile source
[05:35] <maynoth> into .deb
[05:36] <maynoth> I really wanna learn
[05:36] <kambiz> hey guys, if i found a potential bug who should i talk to or how should i report it?

[05:36] <sanityx> Amaranth, I can't wait till I get my new laptop tomorrow so I can actually RUN 6.10. Right now I'm running a knoppix 4 hd install off of a PII 333 Mhz /w 512 MB ram
[05:36] <maynoth> thankies

[05:38] <r00t_> dabaR,  THank you so much
[05:38] <dennister> <--is struggling with kgdb, too
[05:38] <ademan> Amaranth: is there any way to use the theme manager to install as root? (ie to /usr/share/themes)
[05:38] <Timym> The system is runing but I cant get it to connect to the net
[05:38] <linuxcrazy> wow
[05:38] <kambiz> hey guys, if i found a potential bug who should i talk to or how should i report it?
[05:38] <linuxcrazy> I'm finally unbanned
[05:38] <ademan> kambiz: http://www.launchpad.net
[05:38] <Amaranth> ademan: nope
[05:38] <dennister> and besides, how could just changing the xorg.conf file get rid of the second session?
[05:38] <linuxcrazy> @lart LjL
[05:38] <eilker> tokenbad: i had same problem, port forwarding solved my problem
[05:39] <kambiz> thanks ademan
[05:39] <r00t_> dabaR, now i got problem with php5 . i install apache2 , php5 , mysql . buts its wont show php file . please help me
[05:39] <ademan> Amaranth: can i manually copy the folder containing the theme?
[05:39] <Amaranth> linuxcrazy: Not a good way to start
[05:39] <linuxcrazy> dude
[05:39] <Amaranth> ademan: yeah
[05:39] <dabaR> maynoth: you can use checkinstall, or read http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34479/ that is an extract from the openweek today's packaging 101 session http://people.ubuntu.com/~fabbione/irclogs/ubuntu-classroom-current.html is the place I made that pastebin from
[05:39] <TokenBad> I have no router
[05:39] <TokenBad> eilker, I have no router
[05:39] <ademan> i mean, a "theme" is just a tarball with a folder containing a folder named gtk+ or whatever
[05:39] <Amaranth> linuxcrazy: you're only unbanned because we lost the ban list, try not to draw attention to yourself
[05:40] <dabaR> !lamp > r00t_
[05:40] <ademan> Amaranth: woulda been great to be able to use the theme manager but meh
[05:40] <r00t_>  i got problem with php5 . i install apache2 , php5 , mysql . buts its wont show php file . please help me
[05:40] <r00t_> lamp ?
[05:40] <linuxcrazy> I didn't even do anything lol. LjL just had a bad day or something. I was trying to help people out and he kept saying "have you read the rules" and "you're not being polite" or something like that
[05:40] <ademan> r00t_: what do you mean it wont show the php file?
[05:40] <sanityx> Hey silly question, whats the name of that new thing they used in 6.10 to replace the init system with?
[05:40] <eilker> !lamp > root
[05:40] <Amaranth> r00t_: Install libapache2-mod-php3
[05:40] <dabaR> r00t_: read and follow the tutorial you got in pm
[05:40] <eilker> !lamp > r00t
[05:40] <Amaranth> r00t_: Install libapache2-mod-php5, rather
[05:40] <linuxcrazy> !LAMP
[05:40] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.

[05:40] <linuxcrazy> there you go
[05:40] <dabaR> thanks
[05:40] <ademan> the p used to stand for perl :-)
[05:40] <Timym> can anyone assist me with getting my wireless net set up
[05:41] <TokenBad> eilker, since I don't have a router....port forwarding isn't and issue
[05:41] <sanityx> Timym, perhaps.
[05:41] <Amaranth> It's Linux-Apache-Most of languages start with P-Postgres ;)
[05:41] <linuxcrazy> @leet Amaranth

[05:41] <Timym> ok ...

[05:41] <Timym> just so you know im completly new to any linux systems
[05:42] <linuxcrazy> hey sorry, I did it like 3 times in 5 minutes

[05:42] <linuxcrazy> how can we help you
[05:42] <Madpilot> !wireless | Timym
[05:42] <ubotu> Timym: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:42] <linuxcrazy> no problem r00t
[05:42] <rowdy> hi linuxcrazy
[05:42] <rowdy> i have a Q
[05:42] <eilker> tokenbad: yes u r right, i have no idea with proftp....but i googled a bit, there are many pages  releated with it
[05:42] <r00t_> libapache2-mod-php5 is already the newest version.
[05:42] <Amaranth> r00t_: Install libapache2-mod-php5
[05:42] <Amaranth> r00t_: odd
[05:42] <malt> what is a example to add a mysql user ?
[05:42] <rowdy> i am trying to copy a 7GB file from my hdd to my ext usb drive
[05:42] <linuxcrazy> what's your problem r00t
[05:42] <sanityx> malt, #mysql
[05:43] <malt> im using ubuntu
[05:43] <linuxcrazy> I've set up a few LAMP installs
[05:43] <rowdy> nautilus crashed and cp core dumped
[05:43] <TokenBad> eilker, what did you type in google cause I have asked on forums...channels and no one seems to know
[05:43] <malt> and went by site guide
[05:43] <eilker> malt: add from phpmyadmin
[05:43] <malt> but it just shows for root
[05:43] <malt> it comes with no phpmyadmin
[05:43] <linuxcrazy> there's a catch, I found it
[05:43] <ademan> r00t_: where is index.php located? and how are you accessing the page?
[05:43] <dennister> nothing seems to help with this lag, either...full three minutes
[05:43] <linuxcrazy> in that tutorial, you have to install some other things
[05:43] <dabaR> malt: what version do you have installed for mysql?
[05:44] <rowdy> do u guys know how to copy huge files and why its crashing
[05:44] <linuxcrazy> r00t: are you getting php problems?
[05:44] <Lovloss> Okay guys, my girlfriend really wants to watch her thing. Its called iptv media player... does anyone have any idea?
[05:44] <dennister> don't mind telling you: i'm getting very frustrated here with my debugging attempts
[05:44] <r00t_> its installing Amaranth
[05:44] <dabaR> malt: this shows how to add a user in mysql 5.0 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/adding-users.html
[05:45] <r00t_> linuxcrazy,  i got problem with php5
[05:45] <r00t_> localhost/index.php
[05:45] <r00t_> ademan,  /var/www
[05:45] <linuxcrazy> r00t: did you follow that lamp install?
[05:45] <ademan> r00t_: good, how are you accessing the file?
[05:45] <linuxcrazy> are you getting a mod-php5 problem?
[05:45] <ademan> navigating with firefox to localhost?
[05:45] <r00t_> <linuxcrazy> r00t: are you getting php problems? , yes i install libapache2-mod-php4  right now and restart the apache too but samething happened
[05:45] <r00t_> :(
[05:45] <eilker> dennister: just write your problem again, someone helps
[05:46] <rowdy> does anyone know why nautilus and cp crash when copying a 7GB file from Hdd to my ext usb drive
[05:46] <dennister> will try installing some fonts that x seems to want
[05:46] <Amaranth> rowdy: USB drive is fat32
[05:46] <linuxcrazy> r00t: in the phpBB installer; what problems is it giving you
[05:46] <Amaranth> rowdy: fat32 only supports 4GB files
[05:46] <r00t_> http://localhost/index.php
[05:46] <ademan> rowdy: 7gb is too big for ext
[05:46] <linuxcrazy> !lamp
[05:46] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP.

[05:46] <rowdy> oh
[05:46] <ademan> ext4 is fine with it though
[05:46] <linuxcrazy> sorry had to get link again
[05:46] <ademan> actually ext3 might be as well
[05:46] <rowdy> is there a way to split the file
[05:46] <eilker> rowdy: i think its limit is 4gb
[05:46] <EDinNY> what extra libs do I need so that kde will rip a cd to mp3?
[05:46] <Amaranth> ademan: ext3 is fine with it
[05:46] <Amaranth> ademan: the problem is fat32
[05:47] <r00t_> linuxcrazy, yes
[05:47] <ademan> ah, i knew the whole reason for ext4 was butting heads with maximum fs size and maximum file size, so i wasnt sure
[05:47] <dabaR> EDinNY: libxine-extracodecs, http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[05:47] <rowdy> is there a way to split the file and copy it
[05:47] <rowdy> and when i need it i can join them
[05:47] <Naik0> Hey im using xchat for gnome right now, i cant find regular xchat in adept
[05:47] <Naik0> i want to use regular xchat
[05:48] <Amaranth> rowdy: 'split'
[05:48] <linuxcrazy> ok r00t: do this: "sudo apt-get install apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql"
[05:48] <linuxcrazy> I had the same problem
[05:48] <Amaranth> rowdy: it's a program that's installed by default
[05:48] <rowdy> cool..thanks Amaranth...will try that..
[05:48] <ademan> rar supports splitting files
[05:48] <ademan> dunno about tar
[05:48] <Amaranth> Naik0: you need to enable universe
[05:48] <linuxcrazy> it seemed as though you had to install two packages that seemed alike
[05:48] <EDinNY> dabr, at one time I saw that when you looked at an inserted cd you saw an ogg and an mp3 directory and could copy virtual rips from them...does this still work?
[05:48] <linuxcrazy> or I had some problem like that
[05:48] <Naik0> Amaranth: where do i do that?
=== Sby_twenty is now known as co_cool
[05:48] <Naik0> in adept?
[05:49] <dabaR> EDinNY: no idea.
[05:49] <Amaranth> Naik0: No idea where to do it in adept, look for 'Software Channels' or 'Repositories'
[05:49] <dooglus> rowdy: there's no limit on the filesize you can write to external drives, but there is a limit if it's formatted using FAT32 or some such
[05:49] <linuxcrazy> the catch is that you have to apt-get some more that are not mentioned in the first package install instructions
[05:49] <CoolGuy> anybody know where I can get an ubuntu package for gnormalize
[05:49] <rowdy> good to know that :)
[05:49] <Naik0> Amaranth: do you know how to do it in term?
[05:50] <Amaranth> Naik0: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:50] <rowdy> thanks for the help guys..
[05:50] <Naik0> ah ok i finded it
[05:50] <Naik0> thanks
[05:50] <Naik0> what should i add
[05:50] <Amaranth> Naik0: the file has comments in it that tell you how to enable universe
[05:50] <marcusgrazette> can anyone help me with using rsync to back up my home folder to an external drive. i'm trying to use the command:  rsync -arvu /home/marcusg --exclude="/Photos/"\ --exclude="/Music/"\ to back up my home folder and exclude Music and Photos (that i already have backups of elsewhere)
[05:50] <wikijeff> Using synaptics, how can I increase the amount the mouse wheel scrolls?
[05:50] <sanityx> marcusgrazette, i dont think you need the " and the escape charecter
[05:51] <LordOllie> is Glib not workable in 6.1?
[05:51] <Amaranth> LordOllie: glib works fine. it's what the entire desktop is based on :)
[05:51] <marcusgrazette> sanityx: ok so i should use  rsync -arvu /home/marcusg --exclude=/Photos/ --exclude=/Music/
[05:52] <sanityx> well i dont use rsync at all. but that looks more correct
[05:52] <marcusgrazette> sanityx: thanks i'll give it a try
[05:52] <marcusgrazette> sanityx: no that doesnt work..
[05:52] <sanityx> :-(
[05:52] <stiffme1983> my firefox crashes when she meets flash in web...

[05:53] <EDinNY> dabaR, in konqurer you type "audiocd:/" in the location bar...works now
[05:53] <ArrenLex> Nerd42: what package?
[05:54] <dabaR> EDinNY: I use nautilus anyhow, but thanks.
[05:54] <Nerd42> um ... i dont kno ... should be the latest PPC ubuntu
[05:56] <Jordan_U> Nerd42: Do you remember anything more about the error? ( a package is like an intaller for a specific part of ubuntu )
[05:56] <maynoth> OMG
[05:56] <Nerd42> ah
[05:56] <maynoth> someone plz help my add/remove programs icon is gone
[05:56] <maynoth> *_*
[05:56] <Nerd42> wish i did
[05:56] <maynoth> how can I reinstall it
[05:56] <Nerd42> i'm such a noob - should have written it down
[05:57] <Nerd42> If ubuntu comes up like it's supposed to - is there an easy way to get it to check itself and download any files it might be missing ??
[05:57] <ArrenLex> Nerd42: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[05:57] <maynoth> anyone here know how to reinstall my add/remove programs icon
[05:57] <maynoth> its gone
[05:57] <r00t_> i tried https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP but its didnt work :(
[05:58] <r00t_> please help me
[05:58] <dabaR> maynoth: did you try using the menu editor?
[05:58] <marcusgrazette> sanityx: i've figured it out, i was missing  . from the end
[05:58] <bimberi> maynoth: right-click on applications, Edit Menus, click on Applications.  Is it at the bottom of the list?
[05:58] <Nerd42> r00t_, what i've noticed thus far is that ubuntu falls far short of its goal
[05:58] <Nerd42> or else it has the wrong goal
[05:58] <Naik0> please tell me a good ftp client
[05:58] <Nerd42> The goal ought to be to make a "Free Software" OS that does everything that Windows does and is just as easy to understand and use as Windows is.
[05:59] <maynoth> I dont see anything in the edit mednus
[05:59] <maynoth> menus
[05:59] <bimberi> Naik0: nautilus (the file manager) via Places -> Connect to Server
[05:59] <dabaR> Naik0: places>connect to server
[05:59] <r00t_> Nerd42,  i hate windows :P
[05:59] <Jordan_U> Nerd42: Yeah, but it gets better every version, and for the record I find Ubuntu MUCH easier than windows
[05:59] <ArrenLex> Nerd42: sometimes, there are bugs. Believe it or not, Windows has them too.
[05:59] <Naik0> bimberi, and dabaR thanks!
[06:00] <Nerd42> oh crap
[06:00] <maynoth> am I going to have to format?
[06:00] <Jordan_U> Nerd42: See also http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
[06:00] <alex-weej> any ideas? https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/72774
[06:00] <Nerd42> it says "Warning: failure while configuring base packages. This will be attempted 5 times"
[06:00] <maynoth> all i did was install a bunch of gaims
[06:00] <maynoth> games
[06:00] <maynoth> LOL
[06:00] <r00t_> ArrenLex , Jordan_U  you guys are right :D
[06:01] <maynoth> can anyone help
[06:01] <maynoth> ima gonna reboot
[06:01] <maynoth> see if that fixes it
[06:01] <dabaR> maynoth: see ya
[06:01] <maynoth> brb
[06:02] <Nerd42> yeah windows has bugs
[06:02] <Nerd42> windows *is* a bug
[06:03] <Lovloss> LOL
[06:03] <Nerd42> ubutntu apparently sees my computer as "unclean"
[06:04] <Nerd42> whoah dude, this is getting Biblical
[06:04] <dabaR> Nerd42: you sure you did not install ichtux?
[06:04] <Nerd42> heh, i've never even heard of that
[06:04] <Lovloss> Okay guys, does *anyone* know about the iptv media player at all? What plugins might this thaitv.tv website require and how od i find out?
[06:04] <dabaR> Nerd42: it is a version of Ubuntu tailored to christian users
[06:05] <Nerd42> o rly? LOL
[06:05] <malt> what is a good mysql manager for ubuntu? thats simple
[06:05] <Jordan_U> Nerd42: Close, it detected that your CD was "unclean" hence the corrupt package :)
[06:05] <dabaR> Lovloss: did you ask google?
[06:05] <malt> like in cpanel
[06:05] <Lovloss> yeah lol. i heard about that
[06:05] <Lovloss> dabaR: repetatively
[06:05] <dabaR> Lovloss: and it shows no results for iptv media player?
[06:05] <funkja> is there a simple drawing program like mspaint for linux?
[06:05] <maynoth> :(
[06:05] <maynoth> my add/remove programs menu is gone
[06:05] <maynoth> can anyone help me get it back
[06:05] <dabaR> funkja: many. try tuxpaint.
[06:05] <maynoth> I just now got ubuntu set up like I liked it
[06:05] <Lovloss> it just gave me descriptions of what it means. Its an internet protocal for recieving television on demand from paid websites.
[06:05] <Nerd42> itchtux is funny
[06:06] <maynoth> and then add/remove  vanished
[06:06] <Lovloss> such as thaitv.tv
[06:06] <maynoth> Can anyone look at the add/remove menu and give me the information for it
[06:06] <maynoth> maybe I can manually recreate it
[06:06] <Lovloss> I assume .tv  is something that requires a certain plugin
[06:07] <Nerd42> i have a hard time seeing ichtux as serious though
[06:07] <dabaR> it is a top level internet domain
[06:07] <dabaR> Nerd42: OK OK.
[06:07] <maynoth> hullo
[06:07] <maynoth> any ubuntu uberg33ks here
[06:07] <Nerd42> no
[06:07] <maynoth> wahhh
[06:07] <Lovloss> I just wish I could figure out what to do. She really wants this program, and ... *shudder* she has threatened to return to Windows Xp
[06:08] <Nerd42> er
[06:08] <Nerd42> wait
[06:08] <Nerd42> yes
[06:08] <Lovloss> for this I am willing to work at finding a solution
[06:08] <maynoth> gaim is better than trillian
[06:08] <Nerd42> hmm ... didn't trillian have something gaim didnt ?
[06:08] <maynoth> can anyone look at the add/remove programs launcher and give me the details
[06:08] <maynoth> in ubuntu
[06:08] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: What program ?
[06:08] <dabaR> maynoth: Did you open the menu editor? Apps>Accessories>Menu Editor
[06:08] <maynoth> yes
[06:09] <maynoth> its not there
[06:09] <Lovloss> Jordan_U whatever makes the IPTV media player work
[06:09] <Lovloss> i assume its a plugin actually
[06:09] <maynoth> no menu editor
[06:09] <Misnix> maynoth,  /usr/bin/gksudo /usr/bin/gnome-app-install
[06:09] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: democracy player?
[06:09] <Lovloss> you think? WOuldnt you have to open a file with that? this is supposed to run in a internet browser
[06:10] <maynoth> crud
[06:10] <maynoth> i just got it working
[06:10] <maynoth> LOL
[06:10] <Nerd42> the other night i stayed up all night watching the entire season of Pure Pwnage
[06:10] <maynoth> i guess ill format
[06:10] <maynoth> lOL
[06:10] <Lovloss> it used to run perfectly in I.E. by default, whereas Firefox never seemed to allow it.
[06:10] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: IE4linux
[06:10] <Lovloss> we tried that, but it failed also
[06:11] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Link to the site?
[06:11] <Nerd42> whats up wid teh penguin anywayz?
[06:11] <Lovloss> http://thaitv.tv
[06:11] <Nerd42> liek, why does linux have this penguin mascot ?
[06:11] <Lovloss> Cuz its cute
[06:11] <Lovloss> :P
[06:12] <Xenguy> Nerd42: blame it on Linux
[06:12] <Xenguy> er, Linus
[06:12] <dabaR> maynoth, I found a solution, you are so impatient that you left.
[06:12] <slowz3r> Can anyone help me set up NDISwrapper and my external USB Wifi antenna ? please
[06:12] <Xenguy> Nerd42: Linus Torvald, linux inventor
[06:12] <Xenguy> Nerd42: he chose it somehow
[06:12] <dabaR> Nerd42: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux
[06:13] <Xenguy> Nerd42: I've grown used to it
[06:13] <Xenguy> and like it now
[06:13] <Lovloss> By the way guys, when you get error messages every time you install something, isnt there an apt-get command to fix it/find out what package is the problem
[06:13] <bimberi> Lovloss: sudo apt-get -f install
[06:13] <Lovloss> thanks
[06:13] <hairk> I'm not sure if I understand the keyring concept, as I cannot find any detailed documentation regarding keyrings... Currently I have a keyring called "default" and in it, NetworkManager is storing my WPA password. Every time ubuntu loads, I have to enter my really long WPA password.. is this the way it's supposed to work? Or is it really asking for my 'default' keyring password?
[06:14] <Xenguy> Lovloss: look to the error message usually, and then remove the offending app
=== [1] CaptainMorgan is now known as CaptainMorgan
[06:14] <shaym> hello
[06:15] <Naik0> Hey how can i get my home folder and trash on the desk?
[06:15] <Madpilot> hairk, when you set up the keyring, Ubuntu should have asked you for a pw -that keyring pw should now unlock any any stored pws
[06:15] <hairk> ahhh
[06:15] <shaym> who can give me his xorg config file for a ATI X600 laptop video card ?
[06:15] <Lovloss> right
[06:15] <slowz3r> Can anyone help me set up NDISwrapper and my external USB Wifi antenna ? please
[06:15] <hairk> ok, I think I've saved my WPA password as the 'default' keyring password
[06:15] <hairk> which is not what I want
[06:15] <Nerd42> ah i read that wikipedia article on Tux
[06:15] <hairk> how can I change the password for the 'default' keyring?
[06:16] <dabaR> Naik0: it is a nautilus option in gconf-editor, does that help?
[06:16] <Nerd42> it makes more sense than that weird four-color flag logo
[06:16] <Lovloss> Oop! i closed on accident
[06:16] <Lovloss> did anyone send me a message?
[06:16] <dabaR> Lovloss: no
[06:16] <Nerd42> at least you can reasonably direct violence towards the linux mascot
[06:16] <Nerd42> the windows logo looks more ... indestructable
[06:16] <dabaR> ya, windows, unbreakable...
[06:16] <Nerd42> like, you'd hurt your fist - or your knife or whatever
[06:17] <Nerd42> or at least get cut on the pieces
[06:17] <Xenguy> Nerd42: but violence, except in self-defence, is inherently unreasonably =)
[06:17] <Nerd42> OK which kernel do i want
[06:17] <Nerd42> Linux
[06:17] <Madpilot> hairk, far as I know, you'll have to delete your keyring & rebuild it w/ the new password, which is a damn irritation
[06:17] <Lovloss> lol tnx
[06:17] <dabaR> Xenguy: depending on how widely you define self
[06:18] <slowz3r> think anyone can help me install and set up NDISWrapper
[06:18] <Nerd42> Which kernel: "Linux-powerpc" "Linux-image-powerpc" or "linux-image-2.6.15.26-powerpc" ???
[06:18] <Nerd42> which of those kernels do i want ??
[06:18] <poolkey172> Hi again
[06:18] <hairk> Madpilot, I can't delete the 'default' keyring using the keyring manager...
[06:18] <Xenguy> dabaR: after due consideration, I think my statement parses reasonably :-)
[06:19] <richiefrich> Nerd42  linux-image-2.6.15.26-powerpc  <-- any ne2wer ones  then that?
[06:19] <hairk> Madpilot, is it done manually? config files and stuff?
[06:19] <Nerd42> um, no
[06:19] <Nerd42> those are the ones on the list
[06:19] <Madpilot> hairk, no, you'll have to delete it's folder & start again. the 'keyring manager' doesn't actually do much managing of the keyring...
[06:19] <Nerd42> the three i just listed are the ones that are there
[06:19] <richiefrich> Nerd42 that one is fine then
[06:19] <Nerd42> the one with the version number?
[06:19] <richiefrich> Nerd42 what ylist.. the install CD?
[06:19] <Xenguy> dabaR: self of course doesn't exist, or so they say ;-)
[06:19] <Nerd42> or does it matter?
[06:19] <Nerd42> yeah its off a cd
[06:19] <hairk> Madpilot, yeah, it's more like a half-finished viewer rather than manager
[06:20] <richiefrich> Nerd42 the one with the ver #
[06:20] <hscottyh> slowz3r: what problems are you having
[06:20] <ScreaminIke> ok. so i saw Democracy player on Digg. then on boingboing. and i've tried it in the past. and it does this thing where it installs the Mozilla browser. which is fine, i guess. a dependency is a dependency. BUT.... then i can't force my system to use firefox. it's like it forgets that firefox exists, so, unless i launch it manually, any link clicked opens the Mozilla browser. is there a fix for this.?
[06:20] <Nerd42> (a cd i am unable to take out of the drive in fact, due to the wierdness of mac hardware)
[06:20] <Nerd42> ok its installing teh kernel
[06:20] <Madpilot> hairk, you can just delete ~/.gnome2/keyrings/ to re-start your keyring from scratch
[06:20] <hairk> Madpilot, thank you!!
[06:21] <Lovloss> Okay guys, i installed democracy and it still wont buffer in thaitv.tv... it just sits there. any ideas?
[06:21] <dabaR> Lovloss: give a link to the page you are trying to get to work.
[06:21] <Jordan_U> ScreaminIke: Yup, preferred applications, it's in the menues somewhere :)
[06:21] <Lovloss> davaR: Its kind of a paysite with membership
[06:21] <ScreaminIke> yea. that doesn't work.
[06:22] <Lovloss> er dabaR
=== Gotti is now known as jr-gotti
[06:22] <Lovloss> hold on
[06:22] <dabaR> ScreaminIke: did you look in default apps?
[06:22] <ScreaminIke> where is that?
[06:22] <Jordan_U> ScreaminIke: If yu try to remove mozilla does it try to remove democracy also?
[06:22] <dabaR> ScreaminIke: it is in prefs under system I think
[06:23] <ScreaminIke> you can't remove mozilla without removing democracy. it's a dependency
[06:23] <ScreaminIke> dabaR, yea. prefered apps. doesn't fix it.
[06:23] <malt> what is a good mysql manager for ubuntu? thats simple
[06:23] <Lovloss> dabaR: by the way, this is "sattelite television"...
[06:23] <ScreaminIke> know what? haven't tried it on edgy. installing dem., now, so... i'll let you know once it insalls
[06:24] <dabaR> ScreaminIke: let me know what is in your pref'd apps for browser.
[06:24] <sproingie> i'm trying to set postfix up on a dapper server and can't seem to get it to receive
[06:24] <Lovloss> okay we're going to call customer support
[06:24] <Lovloss> thanks guys
[06:24] <Nerd42> how easy (or hard) would it be to setup this game program in linux? http://zsnes.com/
[06:25] <sproingie> should i chown /var/mail to nobody?  it's owned by root right now
[06:26] <sproingie> bah, it doesn't even create the owner for the mail spool file properly
[06:26] <dabaR> !info zsnes
[06:26] <ubotu> zsnes: Emulator of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (TM). In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.420-2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 513 kB, installed size 3232 kB (Only available for i386)
[06:26] <sproingie> postfix just seems utterly broken out of the box
=== [1] wenko2 is now known as wenko2
[06:26] <dabaR> Nerd42: it would involve setting up your sources to include multiverse and installing a package.
[06:27] <ouroboros_> Anyone feel like helping a brother out with a UVC video problem... drivers compile and modprobe fine but no video... and errors in dmesg.
[06:27] <Nerd42> ok then it'd be hard lol
=== wenko2 is now known as wenko[Laptop] 
[06:27] <dabaR> that is in the eye of the beholder. to me it would be trivial
[06:27] <suacy> Nerd42: zsnes is the first program i ever compiled on ubuntu, and it went without a hitch
[06:27] <Nerd42> Ya know what the world needs?
[06:27] <Nerd42> A Linux; Media Center Edition
[06:28] <Nerd42> o rly :)
[06:28] <sproingie> aww crap, nevermind.  bloody freakin dns wasn't set up right
[06:28] <Nerd42> what hardware?
[06:28] <Nerd42> i was sayin: there ought to be a distro of linux that makes it easy to play movies and music and games
[06:29] <Nerd42> like, the way edubuntu is intended for schools
[06:29] <__lynX> It's not already easy?
[06:30] <Nerd42> NO
[06:30] <__lynX> Er...
[06:30] <dabaR> Nerd42: nothing will be easy to set up til you learn to install packages...
[06:30] <dennister> ok, found what I think is the problem with the fonts in xorg...xorg7.1 uses wrong path
=== vn- is now known as [vn] 
[06:30] <Nerd42> i'm gonna learn

[06:31] <dabaR> !synaptic > Nerd42
[06:31] <Nerd42> But I'm not gonna be able to get teh fifty or so n00bs I come in contact with who are always asking me to solve their computer probs to learn
[06:31] <ScreaminIke> if anyone is still interested... it's fixed, whatever the issue is.
[06:32] <dabaR> ScreaminIke: cool
[06:32] <Nerd42> When somebody needs an OS, and doesn't want to have to spend lots of time trying to learn complicated things about computers, I can't say, "Oh, you should get Linux"
[06:32] <Nerd42> Well, I could SAY it
[06:32] <Nerd42> but then I'm stuck helping them with it constantly
[06:33] <Nerd42> with windows its only periodically
[06:33] <Nerd42> The advantage of Windows is that it assumes people are stupid - and many people are.
[06:33] <dabaR> Nerd42: that is an oversimplification
[06:33] <Nerd42> we need a Linux for Stupid People basically
[06:34] <Nerd42> one that doesn't require typing
[06:34] <Nerd42> at prompts and crap
[06:34] <__lynX> We'll hook up little brainwave monitors that read your mind!
[06:34] <Nerd42> I mean, for myself, MS-DOS 6.2 is the best operating system ever
[06:35] <dabaR> Nerd42: we are going that way. Linux for human beings is what you could translate to linux for stupid people if you want to oversiplify
[06:35] <Nerd42> 1. It ran off a floppy disk 2. it had a wide selection of cool games and 3. there was no shutdown command - just flip the switch
[06:35] <jb0nd38372> Someone tell me where I could find "kiba-dock-0.1.tar.bz2"?  The site http://forum.beryl-project.org/post-42243#p4224 is giving a 404
[06:35] <dabaR> jb0nd38372: did you ask google?
[06:35] <Nerd42> well Ubuntu isn't doing that thus far
[06:35] <Nerd42> people want an OS that figures stuff out for them, not an OS they have to figure out
[06:36] <jb0nd38372> yes, google ll refers back to the 404 site, dunno if they crashed or what, was hoping someone might have it locally saved
[06:36] <__lynX> I think that generalization isn't quite accurate

[06:37] <jr-gotti> and the results?

[06:40] <jr-gotti> i had to go out and buy an nvidia card
[06:40] <poolkey172> jr-gotti : this is just for basic X
[06:40] <wastrel> that should be a ubotu factoid
[06:40] <bradley> how do i format an external (usb) drive?
[06:40] <poolkey172> jr-gotti : is there anything I can run to check my hardware ?
[06:40] <startswithz> hello I need to print a file but I cannot mount my printer (be gentle extreme newbie)

[06:47] <jr-gotti> Spitzfire, whats going on now? you downloaded mozilla?
[06:47] <Spitzfire> sais i have to burn a cd i want to do dual op systems with vmware
[06:47] <startswithz> why did you download ubuntu spitzfire?
[06:48] <dutch> reading the wiki, it tells me to install a restricted modules package, dependant on which kernel i have isntalled
[06:48] <poolkey172> jr-gotti : xorg.conf is allready foobared as it's aconfig for a differnet machine :)
[06:48] <dutch> but right now, a generic kernel is installed now, not a 386 kernel
[06:48] <jr-gotti> poolkey172, ah! wonderful! haha
[06:48] <poolkey172> lol it works
[06:48] <dutch> anybody know more about nvidia-glx configuration?
[06:48] <dabaR> dutch: aptitude search restricted install the appropriate one
[06:49] <startswithz> try the xgl channel dutch
[06:49] <dutch> dabaR: but which is the appropriate? it already has generic restricted modules installed, but not 386 ones
[06:50] <dabaR> it tells you which is for which
[06:50] <Spitzfire> anyone know how to load this os with vm ware
[06:50] <dutch> startswithz: not xgl, glx, just my card to work
[06:50] <startswithz> yeah I realized I'd made a mistake as soon as I sent it
[06:50] <poolkey172> WOW
[06:50] <startswithz> probably best to just ignore me
[06:51] <poolkey172> grrrr
[06:51] <dutch> dabaR: i already have linux-restricted-modules-generic installed, but the wiki says if i have generic installed, it wont work...is it lying?
[06:51] <poolkey172> my profile doesn;t work I'll fix it in the moring
[06:51] <dabaR> dutch: generic is for 64 bit, 486 is for x86 arch
[06:51] <noiesmo> dutch, sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[06:51] <dabaR> dutch: or at least that is what the page says
[06:52] <dutch> dabaR: okay then, hopefully that works
[06:52] <dabaR> dutch: try and let me know
[06:52] <dutch> dabaR: thanks
[06:52] <dabaR> good luck
[06:53] <justin__> where can I find the name of my localhost for a mysql database  on my Ubuntu LAMP server to install gallery2
[06:53] <dutch> dabaR: yeah, running that just tells me: "linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version"
[06:53] <dabaR> justin__: show us the tutorial that tells you to do that?
[06:53] <malt> when i installed phpmyadmin, i couldn't access it by url/phpmyadmin/ anyone know what maybe is wrong?
[06:53] <dutch> dabaR: so, iam good?
[06:53] <dabaR> dutch: noiesmo gave you that command, I am still telling you to use the -386 not -generic
[06:53] <Lovloss> II found a patch for Wine and i cant figure out how to instalkl it
[06:53] <justin__> dabaR: i'm installing gallery2 from repos
[06:54] <dutch> dabaR: oh lol alrighty
[06:54] <dabaR> justin__: and yuo need to find out what?
[06:54] <poolkey172> Hmmmm anyone know what the file is called in your home directory that allows u to choose what windows manager for x to run ?
[06:54] <dabaR> poolkey172: .dmrc
[06:54] <justin__> the name or ip of the host running mysql
[06:54] <poolkey172> dabar : no ?
[06:54] <_goofy_> will ubuntu Run on a flash drive
[06:55] <dabaR> justin__: so type in localhost
[06:55] <poolkey172> dabar : I modified something else : like .xstartup maybe ?
[06:55] <Lovloss> _goofy_ my USB drive works fine, but if you mean one of those little sticks i dunno
[06:55] <justin__> k
[06:55] <Lovloss> I believe they can
[06:55] <dutch> dabaR: okay then, running that is installing nvidia-glx and all that good stuff too, so hopefully im cool. thanks for the help
[06:55] <wastrel> _goofy_:  you can boot from a live cd and use the flash drive as your home directory... but it won't really work to run the whole OS from a flash drive
[06:55] <dabaR> dutch: $20
[06:55] <dabaR> poolkey172: ls -a will show you all .files
[06:56] <dutch> dabaR: thats the going rate these days? ;-)
[06:56] <dabaR> dutch: I just have this thing for telling people that when they say thanks, even in person
[06:57] <poolkey172> Hmmmm think theres something wrong with my fluxbox/startup file....
[06:57] <dutch> dabaR: lol, no harm in that. have a good night
[06:57] <poolkey172> away patching
[06:57] <dabaR> dutch: you too thaks
[06:59] <dabaR> !test
[06:59] <ubotu> Failed.
[07:00] <atroWork> wastrel, why can't you run the whole OS from a flash drive? so long as you can get your bios to boot to the flash drive...
[07:00] <justin__> after installing gallery2 on my server with the ubunturepos, how would I get into it from my server? will it be installed in my /www directory?
[07:00] <dabaR> justin__: ls /var/www/
[07:01] <atroWork> justin__, dpkg -L gallery2 will show you where the package installed files
[07:01] <dabaR> !installation > atroWork
[07:01] <justin__> thanks
[07:01] <wastrel> atroWork:  i gather from watching ppl talk about it in this chan that flash has a limited number of write cycles & installing onto it would burn through most/all of them
[07:01] <poolkey172> damn it fluxbox aint workin
[07:01] <wastrel> wouldn't be surprised if i'm completely wrong.
[07:02] <metatecque> !livebuild
[07:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about livebuild - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:03] <dabaR> metatecque: what do you want to know?
[07:04] <atroWork> wastrel, yeah, flash's lifespan is much more limited than a HDD, but there's no reason you can't install ubuntu on it. Just won't last as long ;)
[07:05] <gpled> is their a problem with installing java in firefox on amd64 system?
[07:05] <jbroome> yes, it doesn't exist
[07:06] <dabaR> gpled: there is a section about it in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
[07:07] <justin__> will gallery2 work right away when it's installed from teh repos? i have really no clue what im doing heh
[07:07] <gpled> is their an easy way to install 32firefox on amd64 6.10 system?
[07:08] <Weyoon> Can anyone help me get sound working on my laptop in ubuntu desktop 6.10?
[07:08] <justin__> nvm i got it
[07:08] <justin__> thanks for the help
[07:09] <dabaR> gpled: it also shows a section about that in the link I gave you.
[07:10] <Weyoon> dmesg shows "ALI 5451: probe of 000:00:08.0 failed with error -16"
[07:10] <AnthonyG> Bah , The Smart Link drivers aren't working.
[07:10] <dabaR> maybe they aren't so smart after all
[07:10] <haxality> hello
[07:10] <AnthonyG> dabaR: Indeed XD
[07:10] <haxality> I forgot.. what's the command to view images from the terminal?
[07:10] <haxality> assuming X is running, of course :P
[07:11] <dabaR> haxality: try gthumb
[07:11] <AnthonyG> Might someone suggest a proper driver for an AgereSystems PCI 56K SoftModem (V.92)?
[07:11] <haxality> that works, but I was wondering if maybe something slightly lighter-weight existed
[07:11] <poolkey172> SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[07:11] <metatecque> dabaR: I am kinda fiddeling around with my system - just started re-developing it today - I got googleearth to work
[07:11] <Madpilot> poolkey172, enough
[07:12] <poolkey172> I just installed bootchart and it wiped my initrd .... soz madpilot
[07:12] <dabaR> haxality: try eog
[07:12] <haxality> ah perfect
[07:12] <haxality> thx dabaR
[07:12] <haxality> :)
[07:13] <dabaR> ;-*
[07:13] <einfeldt> hi,
[07:13] <einfeldt> oops
[07:14] <einfeldt> hi, does anyone know if it is possible to get a new IP address in Ubunut using rcnetwork restart as in SuSE Linux
[07:14] <jbroome> it would be /etc/init.d/network restart in ubuntu
[07:14] <dabaR> einfeldt: try sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart
[07:15] <einfeldt> jbroome, do you type that full path?
[07:15] <dabaR> einfeldt: you would have to, yes
[07:15] <jbroome> yeah, and you need to be root or use sudo in front
[07:16] <dabaR> jbroome: there is no network, it is called networking, afaik
[07:16] <justin__> where can i change the php memory limit for gallery2?
[07:16] <einfeldt> oh
[07:16] <einfeldt> under suse, the command is simply rcnetwork restart
[07:16] <Yggdrasil> how can i change the splash screen that comes up after i login ? and how can i change the bootup screen.. that shows in frame buffer ?
[07:16] <dabaR> justin__: /etc/php/php.ini, or so.
[07:17] <dabaR> !splash
[07:17] <ubotu> To change the Gnome splash screen, open the gconf-editor and change the key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash-image.
[07:17] <dabaR> !usplash
[07:17] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[07:17] <Yggdrasil> excelent thanks
[07:17] <jbroome> dabaR: right.  sorry, tab-complete has spoiled me
[07:17] <slowz3r> can someone help me install networkmanager .6 ??
[07:18] <cafuego> justin_:/etc/php{4,5}/<apache(2)/php.ini
[07:18] <justin__> where can i change the php memory limit for gallery2 'php.ini'
[07:18] <justin__> thanks
[07:18] <cafuego> justin_: Betetr still add a .htaccess
[07:18] <dabaR> !network-manager > slowz3r
[07:18] <justin__> it also told me to do that too heh
[07:19] <cafuego> echo "php_value memory_limit 16M" >> .htaccess
[07:19] <cafuego> justin__ You need either or, not both.
[07:19] <justin__> oh
[07:19] <metatecque> ok, here is a question - my sound card doesn't work it is a SIS 7012 - how do I fix that??
[07:19] <justin__> k i'll make the htaccess thing
=== gimmulf_ is now known as gimmulf
[07:19] <Euphidime> Could someone tell me if it's currently possible to access files on my NTFS partition in an emulated Windows program? (Using Wine) I'm trying to get a game working, and I want to be able to launch my existing installation instead of reinstalling on Linux :/
[07:19] <justin__> thanks
[07:19] <cafuego> Just make sure AllowOverride All is set, so .htaccess works :-)
[07:19] <slowz3r> Can someone help me install the newest version of network manager please...the .6
[07:19] <crimsun> metatecque: it's just a mixer setting issues. Pastebin ``amixer''
[07:19] <justin__> just did that recently too heh, thanks anyway!
[07:20] <crimsun> metatecque: (then tell me the URL, of course)
[07:20] <iBashUsr> hey...
[07:20] <cafuego> Euphidime: Only read-only, and required system DLLs and registry entries won't be accessible, so i doubt it'll work.
[07:20] <iBashUsr> how can you turn off the SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.2p1 Debian-7ubuntu3.1 identification on the SSH port?
[07:20] <DARKGuy> Hey! anybody here has a dual monitor setup? I wonder if I can avoid xfdesktop to duplicate icons on both monitors?
[07:20] <Euphidime> cafuego: Even if I have the partition mounted with writep rivs?
[07:20] <iBashUsr> i don't to be announcing to everyone i got Debian or ubuntu so they can find exploits on it
[07:21] <cafuego> Euphidime: Then I expect you're going to be destroying half the filesystem.
[07:21] <dabaR> !xinerama > DARKGuy
[07:21] <Euphidime> cafuego: I'm using that ntfs-3g thing :/
[07:22] <b3tzi> hello
[07:22] <phpnuborn> any netgear router experts here? in mine it has a Attached Devices menu choice.. i have 2 devices.. a win-xp pc and a ubuntu pc.. the win pc shows an ip address, "computer name", and mac address..  but the ubuntu pc has no "computer name" any idea why?   or how to get ubuntu pc to give the netgear router its computer name..  ?
[07:22] <DARKGuy> dabaR: I'd use Xinerama if it was compatible with XrandR, but since I play games on it too and test stuff with WINE, sometimes it gets a lower virtual res of 800x600 or 640x480 and I can't go back to 1024x768 on the primary monitor without restarting the X server - unless you know an alternative way to fix that :)?
[07:23] <Euphidime> cafuego: I was under the impression that ntfs-3g wasn't unstable. Is that incorrect?
[07:23] <cafuego> Euphidime: To be honest, I don't know. I don't even consider NTFS in WinXP to be stable, so ymmv with non-MS software.
[07:24] <justin__> where would the gallery2 main directory be in? /etc/share/gallery2?
[07:24] <HermanDE> Gawd.....
[07:24] <cafuego> justin__: /usr/share/gallery2 probably.
[07:24] <akant2> Has anyone built iFolder on Dapper?
[07:24] <akant2> client
[07:24] <justin__> k thanks
[07:24] <dabaR> phpnuborn: is it the same computer name the windows computer shows as its computer name in System Properties> computer name?
[07:24] <racarr> Euphidime: ntfs-3g is relatively usable, but it's still considered 'beta'
[07:24] <akant2> I have a configure question
[07:25] <wastrel> what's ifolder
[07:25] <akant2> iFolder is project that Novell/Suse open sourced earlier this year which allows your folders to follow you between machines
[07:25] <akant2> a shared folder on crack
[07:25] <akant2> and encryption
[07:25] <Spitzfire> just got this os to some what work
[07:26] <AnthonyG> BAH!!!
[07:26] <Spitzfire> in .iso mode slow as hell
[07:26] <cafuego> Spitzfire: Yah, running off a CD is slow at the best of times.
[07:27] <tonyyarusso> Is 'sudo crontab -e' valid in principle?
[07:27] <Spitzfire> its on vmware
[07:27] <Spitzfire> probably slower
[07:27] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: Yes, opens root's crontab.
[07:27] <cafuego> Spitzfire: OUCH
[07:27] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: Hrm..then my problem lies elsewhere.
[07:27] <Spitzfire> mybe check the heat on my pc soon!!
[07:27] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: Something isn't running right and I'm not sure where in the process it is
[07:28] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: the cron entry? How about path or env vars?
[07:28] <phpnuborn> dabaR, yes
[07:29] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: I don't think there are any env vars, and the command portion of the cron entry is fine at least.  Five fields sections is */10 * * * *
[07:29] <gouki> Guys, I'm interested on adding partman-crypto module to the current dapper drake installer. Can anyone point me on the right direction?
[07:29] <cafuego> so every 10 minutes
[07:29] <tonyyarusso> yes
=== [1] CaptainMorgan is now known as CaptainMorgan
[07:30] <dabaR> phpnuborn: it is then the netbios name. Ubuntu does not use that protocol. I can only think of setting up samba on your computer and that may then show a name in your netgear. IMO that is more trouble than worth(although it is fairly simple to set up samba for that).
[07:30] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: and the command executes fine when run as root from cmdline?
[07:30] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: yes
[07:31] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: is it an X app?
[07:31] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: No.  bash and perl scripts.
[07:31] <cafuego> hmm.
[07:31] <phpnuborn> samba is already on this  'virtual machine' image.. my windows xp computer sees the ubuntu computer..
[07:32] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: Start the command set 'set -x' so that you get an email from cron.
[07:32] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: done
[07:32] <dabaR> phpnuborn: I do not know of a way to fix it, but think that is the cause
[07:32] <phpnuborn> so how do i get samba to use netbios...?
[07:32] <phpnuborn> ok..
[07:32] <cafuego> phpnuborn: Not. You don't *want* netbios.
[07:33] <phpnuborn> so basically a netbios issue in the ubuntu computer
[07:33] <phpnuborn> ok..
[07:34] <justin__> can I cut and paste the main gallery2 folder into another directory?
[07:34] <_goofy_> does the server version have a gui
[07:35] <_goofy_> pre installed
[07:35] <justin__> yeah i just run the install through my browser
[07:36] <akant2> Any idea how I can get "gdk-2.0" installed on Dapper?
[07:36] <akant2> is there a package for this?
[07:37] <phpnuborn> woah..   netsplit!
[07:37] <jazzrocker> how do i force apt to use a particular repo?
[07:38] <jazzrocker> i added a repo with a more recent version than the "standard repos"
[07:38] <jazzrocker> and yes i'm aware this is a little risky
[07:38] <hupp3l> hey, Does the bcm43xx driver work with 64bit?
[07:39] <Calvin18> Shadowpillar_: haha i have a core 2 sitting beside me.. just trying to get my old P3 running
[07:39] <Shadowpillar_> ah
[07:40] <cafuego> phpnuborn: netbios is broken. badly. Fix up windows to use TCP/IP.
[07:40] <cafuego> phpnuborn: broken by design, by MS that is. Not on Linux ;-)
[07:40] <Shadowpillar_> I was using ubuntu on a PII @ 400 mhz
[07:40] <hupp3l> Hey sorry guys but does bcm43xx driver work on ubuntu 64bit?
[07:40] <Bacta> is there a way to reclaim some space from my ubuntu partition and bring it back to windows?
[07:40] <Shadowpillar_> Calvin18: how much ram?
[07:40] <__lynX> Ow.
[07:40] <Calvin18> 192mb on the p3
[07:40] <ArrenLex> Calvin18: if you're trying to make an old computer useful, I'd recommend Damn Small Linux, Feather Linux or Vector Linux, rather than ubuntu.
[07:40] <Calvin18> 2gb on the core2
[07:40] <cafuego> yah
[07:40] <xen> Anyone know what dictionary Gaim uses, and where it puts entries that I add?
[07:40] <cafuego> hupp3l: Yes, but you need the firmware.
[07:40] <poolkey172> ArrenLex : I installed windows on 1 raid controller and ubuntu on the other raid controller : basically I had to build ubuntu by hand (tediously) it kept failing so I ended up porting ubuntu from a different machine and configuring the kernel and grub
[07:40] <Shadowpillar_> Calvin18: I'd suggest upping the ram to 256
[07:41] <Bacta> is there a way to reclaim some space from my ubuntu partition and bring it back to windows?
[07:41] <hupp3l> cafuego, i installed the firmware and it finds my network but it just cant connect
[07:41] <justin__> where can i find the url rewrite module?
[07:41] <cjonesy> xubuntu could work for an older cpu as well
[07:41] <ArrenLex> poolkey172: so no "sudo /sbin/makemysystembootin20seconds.sh"? = /
[07:41] <cafuego> justin__: 'sudo a2enmod'
[07:41] <poolkey172> ArrenLex : I wish
[07:41] <Calvin18> Shadowpillar_: i will try and play around and see what i can do
[07:41] <poolkey172> ArrenLex : I installed windows on 1 raid controller and ubuntu on the other raid controller : basically I had to build ubuntu by hand (tediously) it kept failing so I ended up porting ubuntu from a different machine and configuring the kernel and grub
[07:41] <hupp3l> It looks like it is about to connect but gives connection failed
[07:42] <poolkey172> ArrenLex : I think if I write a howto it'll take the average joe about 45 mins to port a remote or local ubuntu install to RAID0
[07:42] <Shadowpillar_> Calvin18: ubuntu runs best at least with 256mb
[07:42] <tonyyarusso> cafuego: I suppose it helps if I have mail installed eh?
[07:42] <Shadowpillar_> any less and you'll get major slowdowns
[07:42] <Calvin18> btw is there a way for other people to get into my wep wireless if i dun have any clients connected?
[07:42] <Shadowpillar_> Calvin18: my second suggestion is to run xubuntu
[07:43] <cafuego> tonyyarusso: JUst a bit yes. 'mailx' I think is what you want.
[07:44] <justin__> where can i deactive and activate the url rewrite module? should of asked that, sorry.
[07:44] <dabaR> xen: I found /usr/lib/gaim/spellchk.so but not sure that is it
[07:44] <dawkirst> Waar is ek?
[07:44] <xen> dabaR, I suspect that's the spellchecking module...
[07:44] <hupp3l> by ubuntu dawkirst
[07:45] <Calvin18> can i dun do an reinstaller to use xubuntu? isn't that just installing xfce and making it the default WM?
[07:46] <Calvin18> *reinstall
[07:46] <dabaR> xen: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/gaim mentions aspell
[07:46] <Madpilot> Calvin18, install xubuntu-desktop
[07:47] <Calvin18> and how do i switch the desktop?
[07:47] <Shadowpillar_> Calvin18: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[07:47] <poolkey172> anyone know where the ethernet -> eth mappings are ?
[07:47] <hupp3l> does anyone have experiance with the bcm43xx native driver and ubuntu that can help me out please
[07:47] <Shadowpillar_> GDM
[07:47] <unfo> hupp3l, just ask your question :)
[07:47] <unfo> if someone knows, they'll answer.
[07:48] <unfo> poolkey172, try #ubuntu-server
[07:48] <peshalto> Hi all. I want the convenience and polish of a desktop, but also want to develop and play with server stuff. Should I install desktop ubuntu, or server ubuntu?
[07:48] <poolkey172> dont worry I've worked it out
[07:48] <unfo> peshalto, install ubuntu server. Then: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[07:48] <unfo> That will install the desktop packages as well.
[07:48] <ArrenLex> peshalto: you can install any packages you want on an ubuntu system... ubuntu server just comes with different ones by default.
[07:48] <justin__> how can i deactive and activate the url rewrite module?
[07:48] <peshalto> heh, that must be a faq, right?
[07:49] <peshalto> excellent, thanks.
[07:49] <unfo> peshalto, no problem :)
[07:49] <Madpilot> peshalto, if you just want  to run Apache & such, those will run just fine on a desktop install
[07:49] <dabaR> peshalto: install desktop ubuntu
[07:50] <peshalto> ok, getting differing advice here..
[07:50] <hupp3l> I am on ubuntu 64bit with a bcm43xx card, I have the firmware extracted and it finds my network and I have the right stuff in but it says connection failed
[07:50] <ArrenLex> peshalto: okay, hold on. Describe in more detail the system you want.
[07:50] <peshalto> ok
[07:50] <justin__> how can i deactive and activate the url rewrite module?
[07:51] <Empiric> how i create software
[07:51] <Empiric> in ubuntu during install
[07:51] <peshalto> in the past some of my pain with linux has been it's hard to get basic stuff to work sometimes, like audio.
[07:51] <unfo> Empiric, what do you want to create?
[07:51] <Empiric> any idea?
[07:51] <Empiric> i have 2 sata disk
[07:51] <Empiric> i want to do software raid
[07:51] <peshalto> but also I like to play with different languages, databases, tools... and also want security... want it all, basically.
[07:51] <ArrenLex> peshalto: ubuntu desktop should set you up with that, or you can just apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils to get the same effect.
[07:51] <peshalto> but don't need high performance
[07:51] <keeganX> Anyone know a good guide for setting up mpd and gmpc?
[07:52] <dabaR> peshalto: install the desktop version
[07:52] <LaserLine> When I try to enable the nvidia-glx-config I get the following error: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[07:52] <peshalto> ArrenLex: set me up with that, "that" being which part?
[07:52] <Empiric> but theres no option of creating software raid ?
[07:52] <LaserLine> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[07:52] <ArrenLex> peshalto: with audio
[07:52] <Empiric> during installation
[07:52] <poolkey172> Empiric : How brave are you ?
[07:52] <peshalto> ok
[07:52] <peshalto> dabaR: ok
[07:52] <xen> dabaR, thanks for that
[07:52] <ArrenLex> LaserLine: apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[07:53] <dabaR> LaserLine: did you install the restricted kernel modules?
[07:53] <Empiric> what u mean
[07:53] <justin__> how can i deactive and activate the url rewrite module?
[07:53] <CzarAlex> i appear to have some missing disk space on my drive. according to df, its 98% full but I dont have anything on it (that I put there) to fill it anywhere near that. What steps should I take to track this down? My log files all seem smal (nothing over 300K). Do I need to forcefully empty my trash? If so, how? What else do you suggest?
[07:53] <peshalto> actually i have disks to play with, so if i'm not happy with it, it's just wipe-n-go
[07:53] <dabaR> CzarAlex: check ~/.Trash
[07:53] <xen> dabaR, I found it, it was a text file called .aspell.en.pws ... I don't know the meaning of the last three letters, but that's where the custom additions appear to go.
[07:53] <poolkey172> Empiric : I've just finished my Psuedo Hardware RAID0 install : It's taken 12 hours solid
[07:53] <dabaR> xen: pws or swp?
[07:53] <peshalto> another question: from Ubuntu can I read NTFS partitions on a SATA RAID1 array?
[07:53] <Empiric> its hardware raid i wont have hardware raid
[07:53] <unfo> Empiric, I don't use RAID, because I don't need it. :-)
[07:54] <unfo> CzarAlex, try xdiskusage
[07:54] <unfo> but I bet it's hidden files/dirs.
[07:54] <LaserLine> ArrenLex and dabaR: I did that and it said apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) and tried it agian and got the same error
[07:54] <dabaR> I bet it's .Trash
[07:55] <poolkey172> peshalto : good question : you should be able to but it depends on your raid controller I have 2 raid controllers the via vt8xxxx and sil3512 the sil is linux friends whereas the VIA is not
[07:55] <CzarAlex> dabaR, How do I forcefully empty that via the command line?
[07:55] <justin__> how can i deactive and activate the url rewrite module? PLEASE help me =(
[07:55] <xen> dabaR, .pws...
[07:55] <poolkey172> so I installed windows on the VIA controller
[07:55] <dabaR> LaserLine: aptitude search restricted, post output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:55] <unfo> justin__, I don't know. Try Google. If not, you need a good book.
[07:55] <dabaR> CzarAlex: rm -rf .Trash/*
=== c0 is now known as ce-
[07:55] <xen> dabaR, .swp would make me thing "swap"...not exactly accurate, but semi-sensible...
[07:56] <dabaR> xen: meh, good work on finding it
[07:56] <CzarAlex> says that path is not found.
[07:56] <xen> dabaR, thanks, and thanks for the aspell tip.
[07:57] <LaserLine> dabaR: it said linux=restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version
[07:57] <dabaR> CzarAlex: rm -rf ~/.Trash/*
[07:57] <dabaR> LaserLine: install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386
[07:57] <peshalto> Can I read and write my windows NTFS filesystem from inside an Ubuntu session?
=== c0 is now known as cute
[07:58] <ArrenLex> !ntfs-3g
[07:58] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710

[07:59] <Yggdrasil> thnks
[07:59] <CzarAlex> dabaR, no change. 98% full
[08:00] <dabaR> CzarAlex: it comes down to you hunting it down, then
[08:00] <poolkey172> would have saved me a lot of trouble :rollseyes:
[08:00] <unfo> CzarAlex, xdiskusage /
[08:00] <CzarAlex> unfo installing it now.
[08:01] <unfo> good. it's the best disk-space tracking utility there is. use the cursor keys to zoom in.
[08:01] <TiG4> **-- Does anyone know how to make a vncserver connect to a listening client?
[08:01] <dabaR> hehe

[08:02] <unfo> TiG4, I've done it before, but I've forgotten how.
[08:02] <dabaR> make a server connect to a client?
[08:02] <TiG4> poolkey172, no that wont work
[08:02] <TiG4> yeah its possible
[08:02] <TiG4> its a backwards connection
[08:02] <TiG4> ah i found it

[08:03] <dabaR> thanks
[08:03] <unfo> peshalto, did you try to mount it?
[08:03] <unfo> use the mount command.
[08:04] <poolkey172> tig4 : u want the port number or something ? its 5900
[08:04] <peshalto> unfo: i haven't installed ubuntu yet... mulling my options.

[08:06] <dabaR> not that it is busy..
[08:06] <peshalto> does "LTS" (long term support) mean jack for people who don't pay? does it also mean that's how long (free) security patches are issued for?
=== eno is now known as eno-zzz
[08:06] <peshalto> or is it only of relevance to those who pay for support?

[08:07] <peshalto> wondering about 6.10 vs. 6.06
[08:07] <Ae01> hi, everybody
[08:07] <Ae01> I need some help
[08:07] <dabaR> !cn
[08:07] <ubotu> For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[08:07] <poolkey172> when is ubuntu going to start charging ? I see lots of ppl rushing to get 6.06 installed
[08:07] <jimboedgynoob> lts has a 3 year support I think
[08:07] <Ae01> I have more than one user in computer
[08:08] <_ph00> I'm trying to generate a keypair using gps (a gui for gpg) but it gets stuck. It shows the 'you don't have a private key' message, but when I click on 'generate now' (or 'do that later' no difference) it gets stuck, and cpu usage goes up to 100% and stays there. I waaited up to ~10 minutes before killing it
[08:08] <cwraig> hi all
[08:08] <startswithz> what is the hotkey to switch desktops?  Is there one?
[08:08] <yyx> 
[08:08] <Ae01> I want to shutdawn and restart.
[08:08] <dabaR> !cn | yyx
[08:08] <ubotu> yyx: For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[08:08] <_ph00> (if somone helped me generate some keypairs from the gpg terminal interface (in private) that would do
[08:08] <yyx> ph,thx
[08:09] <poolkey172> _ph00 can u strace -p the process to see where it hangs ?
[08:09] <cwraig> start- ctrl+alt left and right keys
[08:09] <yyx> thanks
[08:09] <Ae01> Shutdown and Restart button disappear.
[08:09] <cafuego> _ph00: gpg --gen-key
[08:09] <_ph00> poolkey172; how exactly do I do that?
[08:09] <cwraig> start - that works for me but ive got xgl installed
[08:09] <poolkey172> #
[08:09] <_ph00> cafuego; ok
[08:09] <startswithz> yeah that works thanks
[08:10] <poolkey172> _ph00 the same way u killed the process : strace -p pid
[08:10] <cafuego> _ph00: it's just follow-the-commands from there on it :-)
[08:10] <cwraig> i need someone to help me with some xdmcp gdm stuff
[08:10] <_ph00> no, I killed the proces with a panel thinghy (kill missbehaving app, or something)
[08:10] <poolkey172> _ph00 oh ic
[08:11] <_ph00> poolkey172, cafuego OK, after all, I only need to generate 3 keypairs, the terminal interface will do. I'll be back if I have more problems, thx
[08:12] <poolkey172> Anyone know how to submit a HOWTO ?
[08:12] <peshalto> someone mentioned 'livecd'
[08:13] <_ph00> hehe
[08:13] <peshalto> anyone know where to download a livecd iso?
[08:13] <peshalto> the usual download pages don't seem to have it
[08:13] <dabaR> peshalto: it is called desktop
[08:14] <peshalto> dabaR: ah, good trick, thanks
[08:14] <_ph00> now that is nothing short of absurd: I'm trying to generate a key for my 'real world' me, and my forst name has 4 letters (Luke) but gpg says it must be at least 5. I guess I could use the 'license version' Lucas, but no one calls me that
[08:14] <dabaR> poolkey172: for what?

[08:17] <poolkey172> dabar : some of them are so out of date or are very version specific
[08:17] <_ph00> yes, OK, Lucas would do, but I wanted to use Luke
[08:17] <Madpilot> poolkey172, anyone can edit the Ubuntu wikis, and joining the Ubuntu Docteam is also easy
[08:18] <_ph00> (that is: "first" name must be at least 5 letters)
[08:18] <poolkey172> madpilot ok : think I should start contributing again... aint written any opensource in years
[08:18] <LaserLine> dabar:  I installed what you said but i'm still getting the Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel. when i try to sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[08:19] <Madpilot> poolkey172, #ubuntu-doc is the DocTeam's IRC channel - most of the action is on the mailing list, though
[08:20] <poolkey172> thanks madpilot : I'll take a look ps how do I list all the channels on this server my IRC skills are 10 yrs outa date :)
[08:21] <Madpilot> poolkey172, depends on which IRC client you're running
[08:21] <racarr> !pastebin
[08:21] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:21] <poolkey172> madpilot : konversation
[08:21] <fek> moin
[08:22] <poolkey172> madpilot : but getting channel list is a server command and hence independent of whatever irc client u use
[08:22] <poolkey172> guessed it : /list
[08:24] <LaserLine> how does modprobe work?
[08:24] <marlun> What package will I have to install (ubuntu) to be able to read man pages of c/c++ functions like opendir()?
[08:25] <Jordan_U> vader: AFIK yes.
[08:25] <vader> Jordan_U, do you have a link for the how to?
[08:25] <dabaR> marlun: manpages-dev
[08:26] <dogfood2006> is that a package dabar
[08:26] <vader> been googling for a while on that one is the reason I ask
[08:26] <dabaR> yes
[08:26] <phpnuborn> isn't ubuntu suppose to be an easy *nix distro compared to most others?
[08:26] <marlun> dabaR, thanks!
[08:26] <dabaR> ;)
[08:26] <Jordan_U> vader: nvm, just checked the page and it says "The 3.022 release supports:

[08:26] <vader> ty Jordan_U
[08:26] <dogfood2006> I wouldn't tell yourself things are eas
[08:27] <dogfood2006> easy
[08:27] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : for plain desktop I think its one of the best out there ,,,, but thats its downfall too
[08:27] <dogfood2006> You'll shoot tourself in the foot and cause frustration when things don't go well. A bette word is...more convenient perhaps
[08:28] <dabaR> or a hydrogen bomb
[08:28] <phpnuborn> if ubuntu is so easy why is there a distro called easyubuntu..  lol..
[08:28] <dogfood2006> Well it's equally easy to do that with rm -rf
[08:29] <poolkey172> lol @ phpnuborn
[08:29] <jfro_> good morning
[08:29] <Flannel> phpnuborn: it's a script, not a distro.
[08:29] <phpnuborn> oh..
[08:29] <Jordan_U> vader: We can tell you how to be your own easyubuntu though :)
[08:29] <_ph00> hehe... stupid me... I entered Luke as 'name' but what the interface meant was *first-and-Last name* not one name each line. OK, I guess I'm good now

[08:30] <Flannel> !easubuntu | vader
[08:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about easubuntu - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[08:30] <Bikerwade> good morning
[08:30] <Flannel> that website/channel can tell you everything you need to know vader.
[08:30] <Jordan_U> vader: The things easyubuntu does really aren't that hard to do yourself, really
[08:30] <stopgo> When I try to create a domU, I get "Error: Device 0 (vif) could not be connected. Hotplug scripts not working." /var/log/xen-hotplug.log is full of ERROR 53: bad trap. I'm running Ubuntu Edgy, built my own kernel from the 3.03 source. I've read that this problem is caused by the scripts in /etc/xen/scripts beginning with #!/bin/sh instead of bash, but I switched them to bash and still have the same trouble.
[08:31] <poolkey172> COool I like it : easyubuntu is like automatix
[08:31] <Flannel> stopgo: you sure you got all of them?
[08:31] <stopgo> flannel: grep tells me so
[08:32] <stopgo> I've also linked /bin/sh to /bin/bash, so if bashisms in the scripts are the problem, my default shell should be bash now
[08:32] <poolkey172> stopgo : thats a very bad idea
[08:33] <vader> Jordan_U, I know but ummmm I work 60 - 80 hours a week, I need the easy way out on a lot of things lol
[08:33] <Bikerwade> I'm having trouble... my add/remove programs won't start....

[08:34] <poolkey172> stopgo : #!/bin/sh shouldnt be messed with buddy : change it back : yup
[08:35] <mordof> alright.. i forget how to untar stuff, lol
[08:35] <poolkey172> if u want your default shell to be bash just stick it in /etc/passwd
[08:35] <mordof> haven't used ubuntu in a long time

[08:46] <mordof> Madpilot: i'm on irssi
[08:47] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: People who don't know about the package manager often download the tar.gz, read the instructions and when they come here asking why the "make" thingy didn't work we tell them to use apt instead :)

[09:00] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: ok, how/where...? *feeling very lost*
[09:00] <ArrenLex> "sudo apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils alsa-oss"
[09:00] <Copan> my account has sudo?
[09:00] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: press alt+ F2 and run "alacarte" I can't find it in the menu's either, I was hoping you could :)
[09:00] <ArrenLex> Copan: if you're running ubuntu, yes.
[09:00] <Copan> it has sudo permissions already
[09:01] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: I hardly ever use the menus any more :)
[09:01] <kray^er> hello. i was wondering if ubuntu supports mirroring scsi drivers like the way with dynamic disks under windows. i have an older scsi controller that does not have raid hrdware support. thank you
[09:01] <TheDebugger> System=>Preferences=>Menu Layout
[09:01] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: i see...
[09:01] <Copan> ArrenLex:Package alsa-oss is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[09:01] <Copan> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[09:01] <Copan> is only available from another source
[09:02] <boink> !scim
[09:02] <ubotu> Chinese, Japanese, Korean Language input. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SCIM
[09:02] <ArrenLex> Copan: you'll need to add universe to your /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:02] <Jordan_U> TheDebugger: Ahh thanks, it always confuses me when the menu item is so different from the actuall name.
[09:02] <Copan> How do I do that?
[09:02] <TheGino_Frank> Whats the command for the trash bin, if in creating a desktop launcher??
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Copan: "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" to open it in a text editor. Then, add this line: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe multiverse
[09:03] <ArrenLex> and save it.
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Then run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install alsa-oss"
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Copan: and welcome to Linux :) Not the best way to start, is it. Sorry about that.
[09:03] <Jordan_U> Copan: System -> administration -> Software sources is an easier way to do it if you prefer GUIs
[09:04] <kray^er> hello. i was wondering if ubuntu supports mirroring scsi drivers like the way with dynamic disks under windows. i have an older scsi controller that does not have raid hrdware support. thank you
[09:04] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: There is a GUI for almost everything.
[09:05] <Copan> ArrenLex: I enjoy the terminal, its oldschool :p
[09:05] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I know, but I never use it, so I can't offer any advice on it :(
[09:05] <TheGino_Frank> Whats the command for the trash bin, if in creating a desktop launcher??
[09:05] <Copan> ArrenLex: do you have any suggestions on a terminal tutorial?
[09:05] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Neither do I :)
[09:06] <ArrenLex> Copan: me personally? No, I learned my stuff by trial and error... google probably has some suggestions.
[09:06] <livingtarget> TheGino_Frank: Try opening gconf-editor and going to apps > nautilus > desktop and check trash_icon_visible
[09:07] <Copan> ubuntu is a beautiful OS, a little "sketchy" for a new user to switch from windows, but I love the efficiency
[09:07] <ArrenLex> Copan: enjoy it. I personally hate ubuntu. :)
[09:07] <Copan> but its for human beings, if I get familiar with linux I may try other things!
[09:08] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: Debian or Gentoo man I am guessing ?
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Debian.
[09:08] <Born_In_Xixax> is there any provision to auto-empty or limit the capacity of .trash?
[09:08] <TheDebugger> FreeeBSD :D
[09:08] <Copan> ArrenLex: the process you just told me is done, whats next?
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Copan: what's the last command you've run?
[09:08] <Bartman007> is there any way to force keyring to accept a blank password?
[09:08] <mordof> alright i've searched google and i can't find out how to disable the "user joined channel" messages again, could anyone please help me out? i'm gonna write it down this time, lol
[09:08] <Copan> the last one you gave me
[09:08] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: It's always been my opinion that life is too short to run Gentoo.
[09:08] <Copan> it installed a bunch of new things
[09:09] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: :)
[09:09] <TheGino_Frank> livingtarget, thanks it worked
[09:09] <ArrenLex> Copan: after installing alsa-oss? It should "just work" now. What problems are you having?
[09:09] <Copan> i'll try my sound :)
[09:09] <livingtarget> np
[09:10] <mordof> Madpilot: were you the one that told me how to shut off the join and part notices and all that before?
[09:11] <Copan> ArrenLex: my sound still does not work, the error I get is: The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.
[09:11] <Madpilot> mordof, I know it can be done in XChat; that's the only IRC app I'm really familiar with, though.
[09:11] <charlesfrancis> hi, I'm a Ubuntu newbie who is trying to help another Ubuntu newbie get on online.  We are getting a link light with our newly installed version of Ubuntu 6.10, but when we open a shell prompt and do a ping www.yahoo.com, we get no response
[09:11] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: I think there are a lot of things that I don't like about ubuntu, no gcc, no emacs, but they are things easily remidied, for me it is easier to make Ubuntu the way I like it than Debian, but it is pretty easy in both so I don't really know why I use Ubuntu actually now that I think of it :)
[09:12] <ArrenLex> Copan: could I ask you to run the command "amixer" in a terminal? It will give you lots of text. Paste this text into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ to get a link for it and then paste that link back to the channel.
[09:12] <livingtarget> Copan: also what does lspci -v show you, do you see your audio controller there?
[09:12] <mordof> Madpilot: *sighs*, someone told me how to use an irc command to tell the server not to send those notices, lol.. but i was in the process of restarting and couldn't write it down
[09:12] <Copan> yes sir
[09:12] <Arafangion> Hello guys - I've installed Edgy, however my console font is large and the colours aren't very good - why might this have been changed from Dapper?
[09:13] <Copan> ArrenLex: you were wrong about the mass of text, the text I got is as follows: amixer: Mixer attach default error: No such device
[09:13] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Yeah... I'm one of those Free Software hippies.
[09:13] <crimsun> Copan: what computer do you have (make & model)?
[09:13] <Arafangion> The font is _huge_.
[09:13] <Copan> crimsun: Toshiba sattelite, sadly designed for windows xp :(
[09:13] <Copan> 2004 i believe
[09:13] <livingtarget> Copan: What does lspci -v show you, do you see your audio controller there?
[09:14] <crimsun> Copan: which satellite model?
[09:14] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: You must _love_ Feisty then ;)
[09:14] <Copan> uhmm.
[09:14] <Arafangion> mordof: It's probably some flag you tell nickserv to set for you, then.
[09:14] <Copan> crimsun: sattelite model P10
[09:14] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: Why? What happened there?
[09:15] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: nvidea-glx and fglrx installed by default in fiesty
[09:15] <ArrenLex> God bless.
[09:15] <Richard__> I'm trying to samba with a win xp pc and one ubuntu pc. They're both connected to a modem with a bulit in switch (both boxes have an individual external ip adress)
[09:15] <ArrenLex> Glad I got away from there. *debianetch.hug*
[09:15] <Copan> livingtarget: it shows me a lot of text
[09:15] <crimsun> Copan: which P10?
[09:15] <Richard__> but 'tis not working
[09:15] <ArrenLex> Copan: Paste the output of "lspci | grep -i audio"
[09:15] <ArrenLex> For starters.
[09:16] <Copan> P10 PSP16C is my guess
[09:16] <Jordan_U> ArrenLex: BUT not before giving you a lecture on why they are bad, so it really is good for the zealots because peeople are at least getting educated, and you do get to choose weather or not you want them installed.
[09:16] <Arafangion> The console is 80 columns wide, and 24 lines high, which seems to be normal but the font just seems to be "big", and in nethack, I can't see any of the money, etc, because the colour is wrong!
[09:16] <Copan> ArrenLex: ATI Technologies Inc IXP150 AC'97 Audio Controller
[09:17] <ArrenLex> At least the kernel knows about it, then.
[09:17] <ArrenLex> Jordan_U: I can understand that there's some people who want everything to Just Work regardless of where the source came from. I'm fine with that. I'm just saying I, personally, hate ubuntu.
[09:17] <lyy> Linux ubuntu 2.6.12-9-386 #1 Mon Oct 10 13:14:36 BST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
[09:17] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: Ubuntu on laptops and desktops, Debian on everything else, I always say ;)
[09:18] <lyy> can someone tell me how to install mplayer on this ubuntu version ? Linux ubuntu 2.6.12-9-386 #1 Mon Oct 10 13:14:36 BST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
[09:18] <ArrenLex> lyy: apt-get install mplayer
[09:18] <charlesfrancis> hi, I'm not sure if we are visible in this channel.  Is anyone seeing this message?
[09:18] <Jordan_U> charlesfrancis: No.
[09:19] <ArrenLex> charlesfrancis: no, s.. DAMN YOU
[09:19] <Jordan_U> :)
[09:19] <charlesfrancis> heh.  Thanks
[09:19] <lyy> ArrenLex: it says i have dependences that are needed
[09:19] <crimsun> Copan: lsmod |grep ^snd_atiixp
[09:19] <Copan> ArrenLex: do you have any other suggestions?
[09:19] <ArrenLex> lyy: And? Install them.
[09:19] <Jordan_U> @lart ArrenLex
[09:19] <lyy> can't
[09:19] <ArrenLex> Copan: I suggest you listen to crimsun because he's smart :P
[09:19] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: mplayer has "no installation candidates" on Edgy.
[09:19] <ArrenLex> Arafangion: need multiverse repository.
[09:19] <Copan> crimsun: snd_atiixp             19724  0
[09:19] <Copan> snd_atiixp_modem       16136  0
[09:20] <TheGino_Frank> lyy, synaptic package manager look up mplayer will install everything you need
[09:20] <tripppy> is there a list of supported USB digtal tv decoder's ? ubuntu or *nix ?
[09:20] <lyy> TheGino_Frank: i tried that.
[09:20] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: Ahh, not just the "universe" ;)
[09:20] <lyy> it has dependencies it can't resolve
[09:20] <ArrenLex> Arafangion: nope; ubuntu people don't like mplayer's codecs.
[09:20] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: Damn this is irritating, I can't even read your nick when you message me :(
[09:20] <Jordan_U> tripppy: Go with PCI if you can.
[09:20] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: Your name is nearly black, (It's supposed to be yellow, but something's <censored> in Edgy)
[09:21] <Copan> crimsun: the output I got from that command was: snd_atiixp             19724  0
[09:21] <Copan> snd_atiixp_modem       16136  0
[09:21] <ArrenLex> Arafangion: your chat client is nicely representing that I am the heart of all evil. ph33r me.
[09:21] <crimsun> Copan: great. What's the output from ``cat /proc/asound/cards''? (Please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ )
[09:21] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: It's not the irc client.
[09:22] <Arafangion> ArrenLex: It's the *linux console* itself. :(
[09:22] <Copan> crimsun: 0 [IXP            ] : ATIIXP - ATI IXP

[09:22] <Arafangion> Copan: Don't flood please, I only have 24 lines here :)
[09:22] <Jordan_U> Arafangion: You are using irssi ?
[09:22] <Copan> sorry
[09:22] <Arafangion> Jordan_U: Yes.
[09:22] <charlesfrancis> folks, how do I find out if my network card is talking to my DSL modem under Ubuntu 6.10
[09:22] <TheGino_Frank> lyy, go to software sources and make sure that universe, main, multi universe and restricted are checked then do synaptic
[09:23] <Arafangion> Jordan_U: Why you so surprised? :)
[09:23] <crimsun> Copan: ok, and do any of /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc* exist?
[09:23] <Copan> how do i found out?
[09:23] <Copan> getit "/etc/"
[09:23] <Arafangion> Damn invisible black kobolds in nethack!  This is irritating.
[09:24] <Copan> crimsun: ls: /etc/asound.conf: No such file or directory
[09:24] <Jordan_U> Arafangion: No, just making sure you were in a tty and I wasn't going insane ( I need sleep ) :)
[09:24] <crimsun> Copan: ls /etc/asound.conf ~/.asoundrc*  (don't paste here)
[09:24] <Arafangion> Jordan_U: I am hte one going insane :(
[09:24] <Copan> may I PM you crimsun?
[09:24] <crimsun> Copan: please don't
[09:24] <Copan> crimsun: no such file or directory for the file you gave me
[09:25] <Arafangion> Jordan_U: I sometimes feel that #ubuntu is a channel for newbs, because one never gets answers for _technical_ questions, while #debian actively disregards ubuntu users :(
[09:25] <crimsun> Copan: ok, please pastebin the output from ``lspci -nv''
[09:25] <Copan> pastebin?
[09:25] <ArrenLex> !pastebin
[09:25] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[09:25] <Copan> :)
[09:26] <Jordan_U> Arafangion: yeh, I found out today that #ubuntu-offtopic is a better place for real questions, but it's still no #debian ( but they aren't snobbs either so it balances out :)
[09:27] <Copan> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34511/
[09:27] <Arafangion> Jordan_U: Debian guys aren't snobs either - imho, they have the best system for servers - they just don't realise that a Desktop has *different needs*
[09:28] <Caplain> is there a way to have my phone sync with linux?
[09:28] <fyre|work> Caplain: depends on the phone.
[09:29] <Caplain> sprint vi-2300
[09:29] <brkopac> hey guys, whats a good program to mount cd images with?
[09:29] <ArrenLex> Arafangion: Have you ever been to #debian? No man, unless your question actually requires that you write something out in hex format, they're total snots to you.
[09:29] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: =/... did not find any app of the kind i was hoping for...
[09:29] <userbn> #memek
[09:29] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: ?
[09:30] <Bikerwade> How do i play movies in .iso ?
[09:30] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Burn it to a DVD.
[09:30] <fyre|work> Bikerwade: you can mount them -- mplayer can actually play them directly from .iso.
[09:30] <crimsun> Copan: ok, please try this: ``aplay -Dplughw:0,0 /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
[09:30] <Bikerwade> for examle, is there any virtual CD/DVD app fou ubuntu ?
[09:30] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Mplayer
[09:30] <fyre|work> Bikerwade: to mount them, create a directory first, like mkdir ~/movie -- then sudo mount -o loop somefile.iso /home/yourusername/movie
[09:30] <Bikerwade> hmm... ok
[09:31] <ArrenLex> Bikerwade: the ability to mount images is part of the Linux system itself. Run the command "sudo mount -o loop file.iso /some/directory" to mount an image.
[09:31] <fyre|work> Bikerwade: no need since mount takes care of that :)

[09:42] <Narada> fyre|work: except for the ubuntu-desktop package?
[09:42] <mordof> uh, hi.. was wondering what i would type for apt-get to install the smp kernel for my dual core?
[09:42] <fyre|work> Narada: yeah :)
[09:42] <Narada> heh
[09:43] <fyre|work> mordof: sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-686 I think.
[09:43] <Narada> cool

[09:43] <fyre|work> Jordan_U: the 686 is smp enabled.
[09:44] <mordof> hmmm
[09:44] <Narada> Jordan_U: what is that? beryl?
[09:44] <charlesfrancis> hi, what is the best way to find one's NIC card under Ubuntu 6.10?  I have done a lspci and I have gone into System > Administration > Device manager, but I'm not seeing it.  I have been trying to get on line with this Ubuntu box, which formerly was a SuSE box, and I was able to get on line with it then.
[09:44] <Copan> crimsun: the music sounds beautiful, thank you very much for your patience! :)
[09:44] <fyre|work> charlesfrancis: grep eth /var/log/messages

[09:44] <Jordan_U> Narada: yup
[09:44] <fyre|work> Jordan_U: one is a virtual package, iirc.

[09:46] <charlesfrancis> fryelwork, thanks, is the command grep /var/log/messages ?
[09:46] <charlesfrancis> or do I need to do grep /var/log/messages nic?
[09:46] <naught101> Dheeraj_k: try just "cd"

[09:48] <MrKeuner> hi, why isn't there any updates to edgy after the release. I saw only couple of security updates. I have all the official repositories enabled to my knowledge.
[09:48] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: now that i restarted alacarte, i got an menu (upper left) with a "new item" choice..
[09:48] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: strange.
[09:49] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Name = Add/Remove...
[09:49] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: comment = Install and remove applications
[09:49] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U  mmm..
[09:49] <Bikerwade> ok. done
[09:49] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: command = /usr/bin/gnome-app-install
[09:49] <naught101> huh? you could try "sudo chmod -r 755 /home/dheeraj"
[09:49] <Dheeraj_k> naught101: permission denied :(
[09:49] <naught101> with sudo?
[09:49] <naught101> wierd
[09:50] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Yes?
[09:51] <Arafangi1n> Why is my console font messed up, and why the heck don't I have a default font file setup?
[09:51] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: nvm
[09:51] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: And the icon is gnome-app-install.png
[09:51] <Dheeraj_k> error chmod: cannot access `755': No such file or directory
[09:52] <mordof> sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-686 doesn't work..
[09:52] <mordof> i'm so confused :S heh
[09:53] <db712> try 0755
[09:53] <Dheeraj_k> i remove -r from above command and it worked
[09:54] <naught101> cool
[09:54] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: nope. same  thing again.. it is starting, a window showing progressbar for searching for installed components freezes and after a while shuts it self down... along witt  the rest of the app...
=== rob1 is now known as rob
[09:55] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Sorry I somehow forgot your origionall problem and thought it was just the icon that was gone.
[09:55] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: can you pastebin the output of: sudo apt-get -f install ?
[09:56] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: please explain how to do that...
[09:57] <maud__dib> Dheeraj_k,db712     -R   is for recursive
[09:57] <Dheeraj_k> but why it returned error?
[09:57] <maud__dib> Dheeraj_k,db712     -R   is for recursive    not  -r
[09:58] <Dheeraj_k> oh
[09:58] <Dheeraj_k> thanx every body :)
[09:58] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Open a terminal window, Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal type "sudo apt-get -f install" and paste that to pastebin which ubotu will now explain to you :)
[09:58] <Jordan_U> !paste
[09:58] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[09:58] <Dheeraj_k> wat is the use of -R ?
[09:59] <Guest981> hwllo
[09:59] <Guest981> salam to all
[10:00] <maud__dib> Dheeraj_k  with chmod will change all files and folders permisions below directory not just the one directory
[10:01] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: ?
[10:01] <Dheeraj_k> wat os the use of this command ? chown
[10:01] <Guest981> hello
[10:01] <Guest981> vi /etc/rook
[10:01] <Arafangi1n> liable: consolechars -d results in: "Couldn't find a default font file."
[10:01] <Guest981> cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
[10:01] <Dheeraj_k> os = is :)
[10:01] <Arafangi1n> Why don't I have a default font file? That seems to be rather *elementary*
[10:01] <Guest981> ./squid reload
[10:01] <Jordan_U> Dheeraj_k: To change the owner of a file, man chown for more information
[10:02] <Dheeraj_k> thanx
[10:03] <brkopac> hey guys, how can i mount a starcraft image and get wine to recognize it? Any input or would I be better surved in the wine channel?
[10:03] <brkopac> served*
[10:04] <Jordan_U> brkopac: Probably better served in #wine, since it isn't a distro specific problem

[10:05] <InvisiblePinkUni> how do i split gnu screen vertically?
[10:05] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Having any problems?
[10:05] <malt> Hello, where on ubuntu site does ubuntu have there banners the link banners where i can link there image on my site?
[10:07] <Arafangi1n> How do I set a decent console font, and fix the colours?
[10:07] <Arafangi1n> This is a freshly installed ubuntu system!
[10:08] <puto-madre> yo guys
[10:09] <puto-madre> i just upgraded to edgy... anyone wants to congratulate?
[10:09] <nancyboy> hi
[10:09] <nancyboy> Anyone in  here play hero online?
[10:10] <puto-madre> not me
[10:11] <Lovloss> Whats it mean when it says 2.9% of my files are non-contiginous?
[10:12] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: You have verry slight fragmentation
[10:12] <Arafangi1n> Lovloss: Your system is slightly fragmented.
[10:12] <Arafangi1n> Lovloss: Nothing to worry about.
[10:12] <Lovloss> an it be defragged ?
[10:12] <alien> !ubuntu
[10:12] <ubotu> Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuHowCome
[10:12] <Arafangi1n> Lovloss: Linux filesystems really don't need to be defragmented.
[10:13] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: It won't make a noticeable difference but yes.
[10:13] <natrix> morning ppl!
[10:13] <Lovloss> ok
[10:13] <Lovloss> maybe if i get really fragged ill check in
[10:13] <InvisiblePinkUni> !defragment
[10:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about defragment - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:13] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: Unless you only leave about 10 meg free you won't get bad fragmentation
[10:13] <Arafangi1n> Lovloss: You'd be running a major server with a very active hard drive, and be nearly full if you ever have serious fragmentation on Linux - unlike windows.
[10:14] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34517/
[10:14] <InvisiblePinkUni> why dont ext2/3 systems need to be defragmented?
[10:14] <Lovloss> :D
[10:14] <Lovloss> well i need to sleep. bye yall
[10:14] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: From memory, they basically put the files into the middle of a nice, big chunk.
[10:14] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: So files have room to grow, plus there's two nice big chunks on both sides as well for more files.
[10:15] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: I only speak english and german but that looks fine :)
[10:15] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: sorry, forgot.. okey..  so now what ?
[10:15] <InvisiblePinkUni> Arafangi1n: what if lots of big files and small files are being saved and deleted... it must inevitably lead to fragmentation
[10:16] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: What about the output of running: gnome-app-install
[10:16] <puto-madre> hm, on the kubuntu page i read that laptop-hotkeys are now supported... i use ubuntu, should it be the same here or does this refer to kmilo or another kde app?
[10:16] <Jordan_U> InvisiblePinkUni: If you have enough free space then no, it won't, no matter how many times you add / delete files.
[10:16] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: Yes, but the level of fragmentation is very small - unless you have so little space that it must split the files.
[10:17] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: In addition to that, Linux is extremely agressive with respect to cache'ing the filesystem.
[10:17] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: exactly the same thing happens then.. '
[10:17] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: But can you pastebin the output from the terminal?
[10:17] <InvisiblePinkUni> hmmm interesting
[10:17] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: Type "free", and observe that (assuming you have been using the system for a reasonable amount of time), that you have only about 8 MB free, or even 4MB, or even 1 MB.
[10:18] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: Linux has been benchmarked at being significantly faster than Windows for filesharing.
[10:18] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: where do i get that ?
[10:19] <InvisiblePinkUni> Arafangi1n: :o it only shows 8mb free...
[10:19] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade:open the terminal and type "gnome-app-install"
[10:20] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: If you have 1 GB of memory, it's very likely that 600MB or more is being used for the filesystem cache.  Memory is much, much faster than disk.
[10:20] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: And it can easily just chuck the cache if it needs more memory, anyway :)
[10:20] <InvisiblePinkUni> Arafangi1n: mmmmm linux..... :)
[10:21] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34518/
[10:22] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: line 6 = bus-error
[10:23] <Arafangi1n> InvisiblePinkUni: Linux is a very, very nice Kernel, indeed :)
[10:23] <Jordan_U> Bikerwade: Ok, try running this in the terminal: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-app-install
[10:24] <Arafangi1n> Could *anybody* confirm that a stock edgy install results in nearly black colours whenever a "yellow" is displayed in the linux console?
[10:25] <Arafangi1n> For instance, in nethack, gold and doors and so forth are nearly black, (even though doors are supposed to be brown)
[10:25] <Arafangi1n> Irssi's highlighting is also black.
[10:28] <racarr> Arafangi1n: First vim is removed from the edgy live CD, and now nethack is broken? Blasphemous !
[10:28] <racarr> Note: Slight Sarcasm
[10:29] <racarr> Arafangi1n: Do you mean in a tty? I have not noticed that if that is the case, I installed nethack within 30 minutes of installing edgy just last week
[10:29] <Arafangi1n> racarr: I was surprised when *Debian* removed vim, but anyway.  My problem is that *any* console app that needs to use a number of colours, such as yellow, or black (though blue and pink seem fine), are black.
[10:29] <Arafangi1n> racarr: And yes, I mean a tty.
[10:29] <mborohov> jeeezus, i need a break. i just wrote a state estimator for a robot my friend and i are building, and it finally works, but after a good three weeks of hacking at it.
[10:30] <mborohov> and now it's finally caught up with me in that i can't sleep.
[10:30] <mborohov> haha
[10:30] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: I hope it's got a good, fancy gui, or you had mechanical problems :)
[10:30] <mborohov> 'twas indeed the gui that tripped us up most ;)
[10:30] <mborohov> the state estimator itself is easy. not to mention the entire thing is written in python. heh
[10:31] <Arafangi1n> racarr: Additionally, I'm unable to use the default console font - when I run consolechars -d, I get a message that says I do not have a default font!
[10:31] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: Which gui did you use?
[10:32] <mborohov> Arafangiln: home-brewed, but uses tkinter
[10:32] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: No wonder that it took 3 weeks!
[10:32] <mborohov> shut up. it works.
[10:32] <mborohov> heh
[10:33] <mborohov> and it's pretty too. haha.
[10:33] <mborohov> although, in retrospect, probably wasn't the best decision to go with.
[10:33] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: I'm a wxPython fan, myself, though wx is pretty hairy at times.
[10:33] <mborohov> i dont know very much about wx
[10:34] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: It's a gui library that will work everywhere you expect a gui.
[10:34] <mborohov> Arafangiln: such as?
[10:34] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: And it'll try and use the native widgets, which is both a blessing and a curse.
[10:35] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: Even more compatible than tkinker, even :)
[10:35] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: I've never seen tkinker on a PDA, nor does it install by default on Mac OS X.
[10:36] <mborohov> Arafangiln: Well, I was sort of stuck with tkinter at this point because originally this was for a class...
[10:36] <mborohov> Arafangiln: and I essentially took PyRo, rewrote it, and called it SoaR. In doing so, I was sort of stuck with tkinter
[10:36] <Jordan_U> Arafangi1n: There is a chanvce Ubuntu uses screen font map files instead of a PSF file.
[10:37] <dbglt> Hi everyone, I'm on ubuntu edgy, and I'm trying to install the non-free ati drivers. It says I can't use xgl with them, so how do I turn xgl off and use only xorg?
[10:37] <Arafangi1n> Jordan_U: So, which program or configuration file manipulates it, so that I can at _least_ *start* somewhere.
[10:38] <Arafangi1n> Jordan_U: Sorry, I'm just a bit irritated :)
[10:39] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: Oh don't you tell me that you're one of those guys who aren't happy with merely handing in an assignment, you must continue after it's due and make it something that is very very good, but somehow also useless because it only works in that academic environment, or in your case, just as a toy?
[10:39] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: :)  (I've got a friend who's become just a bit obsessed with a certain OpenGL drawing class, for example)

I've tried Eclipse irc channel but with no response, and sinse I've found something with google maybe this is a distribution glithc, so does anyone know what is the matter with debugging in Eclipce?
[10:40] <Zaldun> [dbglt]  while graphics cards manufactures dont make good drivers to linux we are fucked
[10:41] <Arafangi1n> milaks: Try #java
[10:41] <mborohov> Arafangiln: You pegged it.

=== milaks is now known as axa-axa
[10:42] <Zaldun> ok
[10:42] <mborohov> Arafangiln: It really gets annoying sometimes. Trust me. I'm currently not really pulling my weight in my required courses (bio, chem, physics, you know that pure science crap :p) due to spending so much time on this and other random projects.
[10:42] <Arafangi1n> Zaldun: WOuld you believe it - a number of whiners exist that wish that Apple used xorg(!) :)
[10:42] <mborohov> Arafangiln: I have to be very careful not to start trying to develop for beryl until _after_ finals, for I worry for my health, haha.
[10:42] <Arafangi1n> mborohov: Just get a full time job :)
[10:43] <mborohov> Arafangiln: that requires me first getting out of MIT, which is a job in and of itself :)
[10:44] <Rob-West> is this just a Ubuntu Linux channel

[10:45] <Zaldun> i left one ball and the other :), trying to install beryl, to probe it, impossible to do it. why? driver problems, its clare
[10:45] <Jordan_U> Arafangi1n: What is wrong with wanting Apple to use xorg?
[10:45] <Arafangi1n> *sigh*, it seems that my font problem is Launchpad bug number 58539
[10:45] <mborohov> racarr: Are you another one of those that stalks the blogs? I did... :)
[10:45] <Rob-West> does Cedega support .mdf and .mds files
[10:45] <mborohov> It can be fun.
[10:46] <Zaldun> clear*
[10:46] <Jordan_U> Arafangi1n: If they had we would have had compositing support LOOONG ago.
[10:46] <Arafangi1n> Jordan_U: Now, let's not get into a philosophical issue :)
[10:46] <racarr> mborohov: I read them last year (I was planning on skipping my senior year and applying a year early) and more or less stalked them, but not so much this year

[11:11] <luke_> I can't boot :
[11:11] <luke_> :(
[11:11] <sc0tt> what errors did you get luke_?
[11:12] <luke_> GDM: Xserver not found: /usr/bin/Xgl :1 :1 -fullscreen -ac -accel glx:pbufer -accel etc etc etc.
[11:12] <luke_> "Error: command could not be executed!"
[11:12] <sc0tt> strange
[11:12] <sc0tt> type: "which Xgl"
[11:13] <luke_> sc0tt: nothing
[11:13] <sc0tt> not good :P
[11:13] <luke_> sc0tt:  :)
=== reZo is now known as phpError
[11:13] <sc0tt> You could try Beryl
[11:13] <cherubiel> luke_: did you apt-get remove it ?
[11:14] <luke_> cherubiel:  nope.  I just followed the standard "how to" on our forums for compiz.  I have an ATI card so I had to edit a few files, and I suppose I broke something important
[11:14] <cherubiel> luke_: are you able to get to the gdm ?
[11:15] <luke_> GDM = ?  (sorry, somewhat noobish still, I can do a lot, but some of the terminology escapes me)
[11:15] <sc0tt> luke_: it looks like the Xgl package wasn't installed
[11:15] <sc0tt> rather than you breaking something
[11:15] <vikas> join #srijan
[11:15] <cherubiel> luke_: what do you see now? on the screen?
[11:16] <vikas> who #srijan
[11:16] <luke_> sc0tt:  that seems to make sense.  Some of the files in synaptic were different than what showed up on the how-to.  I figured it was out of date
[11:16] <luke_> well currently I'm using my 6.10 notebook.  My 6.10 desktop is just in console mode.  It can't book into Gnome
[11:16] <sc0tt> Are you running dapper or edgy?
[11:16] <luke_> *boot
[11:16] <sc0tt> ah
[11:16] <sc0tt> one sec.
[11:16] <luke_> edgy.  It's been working great
[11:17] <luke_> Not even duel booting anymore.   And omg raid is so easy to set up.  Far easier than windows
[11:17] <luke_> I wish I knew people people who used Linux.  Tough nut to learn solo.  Really appreciate the advice :)
[11:18] <njan> luke_, chances are there's a local linux users group somewhere near you.
[11:19] <luke_> njab:  I'm in Portland, so I have a feeling you're right.  I'll have to go looking after finals

[11:23] <sc0tt> heh
[11:23] <sc0tt> it doesn't like you
[11:23] <sc0tt> :P
[11:23] <sc0tt> press CTRL + X
[11:23] <sc0tt> to exit
[11:24] <luke_> it's already out of it.
[11:24] <luke_> does it make any difference that I'm not using terminal per se, but whatever good old "command prompt" linux is? (i.e., looks like DOS)
[11:24] <sc0tt> type: "mv /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom.old"
[11:24] <luke_> it doesn't behave quite like terminal does on this notebook
[11:25] <sc0tt> that'll move the gdm custom file so its not loaded, after that try "/etc/init.d/gdm start"
[11:25] <sc0tt> and see if your X install works
[11:25] <luke_> heh... sudo
[11:26] <luke_>  /slap
[11:26] <sc0tt> -_-
[11:26] <sc0tt> try
[11:26] <sc0tt> "sudo pico /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom"
[11:26] <sc0tt> :P
[11:26] <luke_> "starting gnome display manager..."
[11:27] <luke_> but it just sits there
[11:27] <luke_> trying the /pico command
[11:28] <Bikerwade> Jordan_U: i tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-app-install, but nothing happend, still same bahaviour from add/remove app...
[11:29] <luke_> Sc0tt:  it's empty O.o
[11:29] <sc0tt> Oo
[11:29] <sc0tt> which way did you install it, using the custom gdf.conf or using an xsession?
[11:29] <luke_> sc0tt:  wait... we moved it
[11:29] <luke_>  /slap
[11:29] <sc0tt> heh
[11:29] <sc0tt> mv it back
[11:29] <sc0tt> :P
[11:30] <stopgo> if i see this: recv(4, "<?xml version=\'1.0\'?>\n<methodRes"..., 1024, 0) = 114
[11:30] <stopgo> if i see: recv(4, "<?xml version=\'1.0\'?>\n<methodRes"..., 1024, 0) = 114" in an strace, is there any way for me to view the rest of those 114 bites? the rest of that string would be really helpful for me
[11:30] <stopgo> whoops, sorry about the doublepost
[11:31] <Op3r> does anyone know how to make dlink wifi card to work?
[11:31] <luke_> sc0tt:  ok sweet, this is one of the files I modified
[11:31] <luke_> probably what I broke
[11:32] <sc0tt> heh
[11:32] <sc0tt> comment the lines at the bottom out like i showed in the paste
[11:32] <luke_> I changed  0  #1 to #0 1
[11:32] <luke_> per the how to
[11:32] <sc0tt> that'll stop gdm trying to start GDM
[11:32] <sc0tt> er
[11:32] <sc0tt> xgl*
[11:32] <sc0tt> :p
[11:32] <sc0tt> and X should in theory work
[11:32] <luke_> now it says "servers:  # Override display 1 to use XGl (display 1 important for ATI FGLRX)
[11:32] <luke_> 1=XGL
=== admin1231 is now known as admin123
[11:33] <luke_> soooo....  change the # back to the 1=xgl?
[11:33] <sc0tt> yup, add a # to each line below [servers] 
[11:33] <luke_> below [servers]  there's another tab that says [server-Xgl] 
[11:34] <apecat> uhm, i recently installed some packages with apt-get, where can i find some kind of log? I need to --purge the thing that erases my /etc/hosts-file on every boot
[11:34] <sc0tt> yup, comment that out too
[11:34] <apecat> whatever that thing is
[11:34] <Hmg4> Anyone know how i can add a hole subnet in /etc/hosts.allow  for example 192.168.x.x
[11:34] <luke_> ok rebooting (crossed fingers)
[11:34] <sc0tt> you didn't need to reboot
[11:35] <sc0tt> :P
[11:35] <sc0tt> but thats okay
[11:35] <sc0tt> :P
[11:35] <luke_> heh...  to used to Windows.  Sneeze = reboot
[11:35] <sc0tt> hehe
[11:35] <luke_> sc0tt:  you're my hero.  Back in Gnome
[11:36] <luke_> I'm scared to know what happened to that mod I was trying to install
[11:36] <sc0tt> the remains of it will still be there
[11:36] <sc0tt> but they won't do no harm
[11:36] <sc0tt> In a few days, when the beryl project gets their site back up
[11:36] <sc0tt> try installing that
[11:37] <luke_> what do we call these "display" mods like Beryl
[11:37] <sc0tt> Desktop Enhancements
[11:37] <sc0tt> or Eye Candy
[11:37] <sc0tt> :P
[11:37] <luke_> fair enough
[11:37] <mnepton> compositing
[11:37] <luke_> I tried that one that started with a C...
[11:37] <sc0tt> yup
[11:37] <sc0tt> Compiz is the original project
[11:38] <sc0tt> Beryl is a project that started from Compiz, it 'forked' off
[11:38] <luke_> I'm frightened to mess with X anymore though.  Is there a way to backup Xserve settings before jacking around?
[11:38] <luke_> oh cool... I've been wondering what Beryl is
[11:38] <sc0tt> Just do the editing of the gdm.conf-custom
[11:38] <sc0tt> that'll stick you back to gnome every time
[11:38] <mnepton> cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/
[11:38] <sc0tt> unless you really screw things up :P
[11:39] <luke_> I have / and /home partitioned differently on RAID1
[11:39] <apecat> uhm, a correction to the thing i just asked, recently something has begun to reset my /etc/resolv.conf, not /etc/hosts at reboot
[11:39] <luke_> so my understanding is that I can always reinstall / if I need too
[11:39] <luke_> without hurting /home
[11:39] <sc0tt> indeed
[11:39] <sc0tt> I have both slackware servers here setup that way
[11:40] <sc0tt> makes upgrading the OS virtually painless
[11:40] <VSpike> gah
[11:40] <VSpike> this is driving me crazy
[11:40] <luke_> awesome.  Seems the performance of software RAID1 is at least as good as my previous hybrid RAID in Windows
[11:40] <mnepton> apecat: DHCP is doing that
[11:41] <biblio> ciao
[11:41] <apecat> mnepton: hmm well i don't use dhcp
[11:41] <naught101> can you permanently remove a kernel module without recompiling?
[11:42] <apecat> or, ehm i've used the gnome config thing to disable dhcp and use a static ip
[11:42] <mnepton> apecat: you sure about that? "cat /etc/network/interfaces"
[11:42] <Vspirit> uhmm, without the intention of offending, I've lost the overview of the packages that this ubuntu has installed now, to some agree that I miss freebsd. especially when something doesn't work it seems harder to grasp why.
[11:42] <luke_> sc0tt:  so quick theory question.  What did putting the # actually do.  I take it # is a command of some type?
[11:43] <apecat> mnepton: http://pastebin.ca/260426
[11:43] <sc0tt> luke_: # makes that line a comment
[11:43] <sc0tt> so it basically makes it as if those lines arn't there
[11:44] <luke_> sc0tt:  ROFL...  oh man that so explains something I was doing the other day.  Glad I asked
[11:44] <luke_>  /cookie
[11:44] <Calvin18> i think i set my default keyboard map settings wrongly
[11:44] <Calvin18> anywhere i can change it?
[11:45] <sc0tt> Calvin18: system > preferences > keyboard
[11:45] <mnepton> apecat: if you're sure they're changing, look at /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and use "supersede domain-name-servers"
[11:46] <Calvin18> sc0tt: i mean globally
[11:48] <VSpike> where can I get help on getting printing working in kubuntu?
[11:49] <apecat> mnepton: i think i realised what the problem is: this is what dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf says http://pastebin.ca/260429
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[11:49] <apecat> i had one of those packages removed when i looked at some vpn stuff the other day
[11:50] <Arafangio1> Found the bug dealing with my wierd console colours! Damn irritating
[11:50] <apecat> so i guess i just should disable "rogue hook scripts"
[11:50] <solid_liq> gnome suxxors my nuttsors
[11:50] <Arafangio1> It was corruption caused by the boot splash screen.
[11:51] <v4m21> hi
[11:52] <luke_> sc0tt:  thanks again...
[11:52] <Calvin18> anywhere to reconfigure keymaps globally?
[11:52] <v4m21> where can I get ATI readon XPRESS 200 drivers for edgy ?
[11:52] <solid_liq> v4m21: www.ati.com
[11:52] <Op3r> hmmm
[11:53] <solid_liq> v4m21: only the binary closed-source drivers support it (with accel)
[11:53] <BlackHawk> moin
[11:53] <v4m21> k
[11:53] <proj> hi folks
[11:53] <v4m21> solid_liq: do I need to do any compilation ?
[11:53] <solid_liq> v4m21: nope
[11:53] <solid_liq> v4m21: it's a graphical installer that it comes with
[11:54] <solid_liq> v4m21: get their beta driver if you want a 3d desktop
[11:54] <solid_liq> v4m21: like with Beryl
[11:54] <v4m21> solid_liq: thanks.
[11:55] <Rob-West> where can i go for some Driving games for Linux
[11:55] <Arafangio1> Rob-West: Find some sort of Tuxracer :)

[12:01] <LadyNikon> dagdg: I would usually say.. if you are in need of help with ubuntu or a problem with a program which is related to ubuntu then yes.  If its just a problem with a program no relation to ubuntu I would try to see if there is a channel for it.
[12:02] <Chandu> hi
[12:02] <Chandu> can anyone help me on lvm
[12:02] <LadyNikon> dagdg: for example.. getting the program to run in ubuntu.. vs getting the program to work properly or finding  a feature
[12:03] <hcker2000> hello

[12:03] <Chandu> 2nd harddisk I was using as lvm

[12:03] <Chandu> but now I format 1st hardisk ..and reinstalled os
[12:03] <Me> just a random question.. is ubuntu better than windows?
[12:04] <Chandu> after reinstalling Iam not able to mount the second harddisk
[12:04] <dagdg> thx LadyNikon, I just need help getting it to work on ubuntu using the nvidia 9xxx drivers
[12:04] <reverseblade> Chandu, please do not use <Enter> for punctuation. So that we could better understand.

[12:05] <hcker2000> JJRR123Jamesrose: i saw that. I just was not sure about it as it does not let me specify the computer the port should be forwarded to.
[12:06] <simoKING_M> qualcuno in italiano??
[12:06] <Chandu> whole our project data is in that partition , filessytem not found
[12:06] <Calvin18> how do i reset the default key layout?

[12:33] <felixfoertsch> Could anyone help my with my ATI graphicscard?
[12:33] <Seveas> !anyone
[12:33] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:33] <Rob-West> i think i found a Linux game im gonna like
[12:33] <felixfoertsch> I'd like to have the fglrx drivers installed - but I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[12:34] <Seveas> !fglrx
[12:34] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:34] <felixfoertsch> Tried the manual install - tried the install from the Ubuntusources.
[12:34] <felixfoertsch> It always said "Mesa" graphicscard.
[12:36] <felixfoertsch> Okay then - how to remove it completely, that I'm sure theres nothing producing the error then myself?
[12:36] <Rob-West> can someone help me install FLightGear
[12:36] <Rob-West> its a Linux flightsim
[12:37] <felixfoertsch> Rob-West: It's in the Ubuntusources - so just install it with Synaptic.
[12:38] <felixfoertsch> How to recreate the default xorg.conf?
[12:38] <Rob-West> how do i launch it
[12:38] <Seveas> Rob-West, apt-get install flightgear
[12:38] <Seveas> and run it from the menu
[12:38] <felixfoertsch> Rob-West: I assume you have to type "flightgear" into a terminal.
[12:38] <reverseblade> felipe, dpkg-reconfigure  ....
[12:39] <reverseblade> felixfoertsch,  dpkg-reconfigure  ....
[12:39] <felixfoertsch> What does it do?
[12:39] <felixfoertsch> Does it resett everything?!
[12:39] <felixfoertsch> -t
[12:40] <reverseblade> it configures the packages so that the package behaves as if it is first time installing. just enter the package name for xorg, and it will ask questions for reseting
[12:40] <reverseblade> felixfoertsch, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:41] <reverseblade> felixfoertsch, what is your graphic card's brand ?
[12:41] <felixfoertsch> It's an ATI grapihcs-card.

[12:45] <reverseblade> felixfoertsch, I strongly suggest you to dig /var/log/xorg.log.0 or what ever it is
[12:46] <felixfoertsch> reverseblade: What to do there?
[12:46] <reverseblade> Does anyone have a guess about when apache 2.2 would be in repos ?

[12:48] <felixfoertsch> livingdaylig: What type of harddrives? SATA, IDE?
[12:48] <livingdaylig> felixfoertsch: sata
[12:48] <livingdaylig> felixfoertsch: both are sata
[12:49] <reverseblade> livingdaylig, so what prevents you to access to the 2nd drive ?
[12:49] <livingdaylig> felixfoertsch: df -h ?
[12:49] <felixfoertsch> You can't access it due to username/pw? So it is mounted?
[12:49] <livingdaylig> reverseblade: i don't know it is not accepting my valix username or password
[12:49] <manmadha> reverseblade, hee i want to join in Free

[12:51] <coz_> Rob-West,  one thing you can do first is in the terminal type sudo update-menus
[12:51] <felixfoertsch> Rob-West: Try typing "fl" into the Terminal and then press "TAB" twice. It will show you the correct command to use.

Yet, i only seem to get the same /home directroy of sdb1 i'm already in. In other words i don't appear to access sda1 after all despite it apparently being mounted, can you help?
[12:59] <Rob-West> its saying Command Not Found
[01:00] <livingdaylig> *done
[01:00] <reverseblade> livingdaylig, no
[01:00] <reverseblade> livingdaylig, I am no expert on mounting  stuff

[01:00] <livingdaylig> ok
[01:01] <livingdaylig> Can someone help me with my mounting /mnt issue?
[01:01] <reverseblade> livingdaylig, but you should be more specific about your question, just my 2 cents

[01:23] <gautam> poolkey172,  hi mate
[01:23] <gautam> i'm trying to config apac-ssl with php
[01:23] <gautam> any ideas?
[01:23] <gautam> apache2 works ok
[01:23] <gautam> having issues with apache-ssl
[01:23] <poolkey172> I guess I can read the documentation and I'm sure u can too :)
[01:24] <poolkey172> this is primarily a ubuntu channel : linux and ubuntu have nothing to do with Apache u c
[01:24] <gautam> poolkey172,  i did read and add php too apache2
[01:24] <gautam> thansk anyways :p
[01:24] <poolkey172> gautam : what does httpd -l say?
[01:24] <gautam> but i'm on ubuntu
[01:24] <gautam> :(
[01:25] <livingdaylig> !paste
[01:25] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[01:25] <gautam> service wont start
[01:25] <gautam> when i try to Loadmode php5
[01:25] <gautam> gives error
[01:25] <poolkey172> gautam : did u build apache yourself or download it as a package ?
[01:25] <gautam> download it
[01:26] <livingdaylig> gautam: can you peek at this df -h output and see if it tells you anything as to why /media/home/home/conrad is empty http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34528/
[01:26] <gautam> ok 1 sec
[01:26] <poolkey172> well then again if you've downloaded it and are building it yourself its not gona be supported by the guys here :)
[01:26] <gunfus> hi guys, I have some jobs that I added /etc/cron.daily, and they were running fine. Yesterday, I did some modifications and now they didn't run, any suggestions where to look
[01:26] <gautam> poolkey172,  i downloaded via synaptic
[01:26] <gautam> anyways ty for ur help
[01:26] <cox377> gautam: just put another 256 in it
[01:26] <cox377> gautam: lets hope that fixes it
[01:26] <poolkey172> gautam : cool
[01:27] <gautam> cox377,  ye
[01:27] <gautam> cram more RAM :)
[01:27] <cox377> gautam: so is there really no command line install via normal cd?
[01:27] <Jengu> When I run apt-get update, where does it store the package lists it downloads? I want to copy them to another comp that is having trouble.
[01:28] <gautam> cox377,  nope
[01:28] <gautam> livingdaylig,  it does say /media/home has used 2.3 gb space
[01:28] <livingdaylig> gautam: you see, my sda1 suddenly became inaccessible from login  - wouldn't accept my name/password even though they are correct and i don't know what happened to make it so...So, i don't know and i'm wondering whether that has somethjing to do with not being able to access sda1 via mount
[01:28] <gautam> lot of reason
[01:28] <livingdaylig> gautam: which implies what? that there shouod be 2.3 gb of stuff on it?
[01:29] <cox377> gautam: thats really weird me thinks, is there a lighter version of ubuntu without having to ues a windows manager line openbox
[01:29] <gunfus> anyone..? I have some jobs that I added /etc/cron.daily, and they were running fine. Yesterday, I did some modifications and now they didn't run, any suggestions where to look
[01:29] <gautam> if there is some imp. stuff on it
[01:29] <dcordes> how can i edit the list of startup programs while in command line mode?
[01:29] <gautam> download file recovery tools
[01:29] <dcordes> i'm on ubuntu edgy

[01:29] <dcordes> gautam: thank you my friend
[01:29] <reverseblade> dcordes, startup programs, do you mean after they start within the gnome ? your session or global ?
[01:29] <livingdaylig> gautam: k, amigo, syanptic yea?

[01:30] <dcordes> gautam: this is not what i was looking for
[01:31] <dcordes> reverseblade: i mean the ones for my session.
[01:31] <reverseblade> dcordes, the ones that start after you login gnome ?
[01:31] <gautam> livingdaylig, http://www.r-tt.com/
[01:31] <dcordes> reverseblade: exactly
[01:32] <gautam> anyways i'm off
[01:32] <gautam> later guys
[01:32] <reverseblade> dcordes, prolly somewhere around gconf-editor but why do you have to do from console ?
[01:32] <dcordes> reverseblade: cause i can't login :-)
[01:32] <dcordes> gnome
[01:32] <poolkey172> zim : use ncftp
[01:33] <reverseblade> dcordes, then why don't you fix it first ?
[01:33] <dcordes> reverseblade: that's what i'm trying man
[01:33] <poolkey172> zim : use ncftp : allows scripts
[01:33] <reverseblade> dcordes, can you specify the problem why you cannot login
[01:34] <suedoh> hi guys, im having some difficulties not being able to have Xine play audio
[01:34] <apokryphos> suedoh: could you expand?
[01:34] <suedoh> I run gxine through command line to check if it gives any output regarding the audio, but nothing shows up... Any ideas?
[01:34] <apokryphos> suedoh: what is it you're trying to play?
[01:34] <suedoh> though for example VLC Media Player brings audio on the same file
[01:34] <livingdaylig> can someone help me with recovering files?
[01:34] <poolkey172> suedoh : can u play audio in general ?
[01:34] <dcordes> i tried to installed beryl and when i logged into my xgl session, the system loaded the old theme which is ugly. so i looked in the wiki that told me to run a certain command to get the new theme back. after adding this command to my startup i couldn't login anymore.
[01:35] <suedoh> mpeg 320x240 MPEG (libmpeg2) MPEG Layer 2/3
[01:35] <suedoh> thats what it says in the gxine player
[01:35] <suedoh> regular .mpg and .wav files some using win32 codecs, which i do have installed
[01:35] <suedoh> all of these play sound in VLC Media player, but for some reason gxine doesn't output sound?
[01:35] <livingdaylig> i've mounted my /sda1 and i can see it and there is 2.3gb of data but i can't access it
[01:35] <apokryphos> suedoh: do you have libxine-extracodecs?
[01:35] <reverseblade> dcordes, you can try searching the text : grep -r - n my_app .
[01:36] <livingdaylig> is there a heavy duty operator out there who knows how to sort this?
[01:36] <apokryphos> ktogias: auto-away messages are evil :)
[01:36] <livingdaylig> i'm talking like serous geek status...
[01:36] <suedoh> apt-get doesn't find a libxine-extracodecs
[01:37] <suedoh> though i installed all the win32 codecs myself
[01:37] <livingdaylig> a real Ubuntu God
[01:37] <suedoh> it plays the video
[01:37] <bXi> does one of you know what modules i should modprobe for parallel playstation controllers
[01:37] <poolkey172> suedoh : dont now myself much about xine sorry
[01:37] <suedoh> apokryphos: have any idea ?
[01:37] <suedoh> poolkey172: no problem :)
[01:38] <apokryphos> suedoh: you don't have multiverse enabled?
[01:38] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: do you know about mounting n stuff?
[01:38] <apokryphos> suedoh: what version of Ubuntu?
[01:38] <suedoh> where can I find this multiverse option?
[01:38] <ktogias> I just turned it off apokryphos....
[01:38] <livingdaylig> fdoving: ping
[01:38] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: what's the problem?
[01:38] <apokryphos> ktogias: cool :)
[01:38] <suedoh> how can I find out my Ubuntu version :) ?
[01:38] <apokryphos> ktogias: nearly 1000 users here; you can imagine the /away floods :P

[01:41] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: cat /etc/fstab. How else are you mounting them?
[01:41] <reverseblade> dcordes, just dig around what you're looking should be around
[01:41] <reverseblade> dcordes, need not to be 'session'
[01:41] <suedoh> apokryphos: but i dont believe i'm having that issue here... I've gone through that before, when I wasn't able to show up audio...
[01:41] <apokryphos> suedoh: ok, you're running dapper.
[01:41] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i did sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/home

[01:42] <apokryphos> suedoh: have a go at installing it, if you can.
[01:42] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: that will never auto-mount. You need to be editing fstab. Please have a look at:
[01:42] <apokryphos> !fstab
[01:42] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file lists all drives and partitions that are mounted on the system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !partitions

[01:42] <poolkey172> anyone know if there is a vncserver that attahes to X :0 no matter who is logged on ? I'd like to vnc right from the kdm
[01:42] <suedoh> Package libxine-extracodecs is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[01:43] <suedoh> though it doesn't show me the other package :-(
[01:43] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34530/
[01:43] <suedoh> searching for libxine doesn't bring up anything regarding codecs either.
[01:43] <Guest753> hi
[01:43] <suedoh> hrmm... im not sure whats going on her
[01:44] <gunfus> hi guys
[01:44] <dcordes> reverseblade: i coudln't dig it out
[01:44] <Guest753> i need some help with automatix2
[01:44] <apokryphos> suedoh: make sure you've enabled multiverse. Add "multiverse" to any line that has "universe" in /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:44] <reverseblade> dcordes, sorry
[01:45] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: don't understand... i did mount sda1  - this has worked in the past
[01:45] <gunfus> in ubuntu, I noticed that my /etc/crontab has "test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily"
[01:45] <gunfus> i guess 2 question come from there
[01:45] <gunfus> why the test
[01:45] <gunfus> and if my computer runs all the time I can remove anacron, right?
[01:45] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: it would *not* automount like that though
[01:45] <apokryphos> for sure
[01:45] <lucjan> sdsd
[01:45] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i've aldo done sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
[01:45] <dcordes> in which file are the entries for all programs that startup with the gnome session login?
[01:45] <Richard__> rawr
[01:45] <suedoh> thanks, ill give it a shot :)
[01:46] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i don't understnad why not?
[01:46] <Richard__> I'm trying to get samba to work with my ubuntu and xp pcs... but it aint!
[01:46] <Richard__> theyre connected to el internet via a modem with a built in switch
[01:46] <Richard__> and they both have individual external ips
[01:46] <Guest753> 'quinn1.key' could not be opened
[01:46] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: because entries have to be in fstab to be permanent. Or you have to use the gnome tool
[01:46] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i've done it before and then i just copy files from sda1 /home directory  to sdb1 home/dir
[01:46] <suedoh> wow 911 nicks here
[01:46] <suedoh> heh
[01:46] <Guest753> no such file or directory

[01:48] <Rocito> How can i let multiple programs use the sound card at the same time (without running them with aoss <command>) ?
[01:49] <gunfus> any takers?  in ubuntu, I noticed that my /etc/crontab has "test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily", can I remove anacron, and why the test-x?
[01:49] <alek66> does anyone knows the page where I can paste txt there

[01:49] <ubotu> alek66: Please read the channel topic whenever you enter, as it contains important information. To view it at any time after joining, simply type /topic
[01:49] <poolkey172> tomyeah : are you talking LVM or dmraid ?
[01:49] <dcordes> alek66: take a look at the topic
[01:49] <Jaak_> Hi, i am looking for working beryl repo, since their hd crashed... Is there an alternative...?
[01:49] <incorrect> is apt-get dist-upgrade still the method to upgrade to a new version?
[01:50] <alek66> thankssssss
[01:50] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : im talkin about nvraid, its the software raid technology by nvidia
[01:50] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i wish you 'd talk to me than just going !mount and stuff like that. I don't need gparted .... i've created a mount point and sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt or in this case /media/home has worked fine. So, why not now...
[01:50] <apokryphos> incorrect: not for edgy
[01:50] <incorrect> no?
[01:50] <poolkey172> tomyeah : nvraid is a chipset
[01:50] <apokryphos> incorrect: see the faq in topic
[01:50] <incorrect> from dapper -> edgy
[01:50] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : nvraid is a software that runs on the nforce4 chipset
[01:51] <poolkey172> tomyeah : as u wish mate
[01:51] <bezibaerchen> .
[01:51] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: I've been giving you all the valid information. The first link I gave to you explains fstab. The second one tells you how to mount partitions using gnome
[01:51] <Guest753> my problem begins with the 'quinn1.key' which cannot be opened "no such file or directory"
[01:52] <dcordes> how can i edit the list of gnome startup programs without gui?????
[01:52] <dcordes> i can't login anymore
[01:52] <dcordes> please help
[01:52] <poolkey172> tomyeah : are you raiding RAID1 or RAID0
[01:52] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i know how to mount and i looked at the link you gave me regarding mounting and i see that i've done it right.
[01:53] <gunfus> can someone give me a listing of their /etc/crond.daily
[01:53] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: you asked for my etc/fstab and i pastebineed that for you
[01:53] <gunfus> sorry it is actually: /etc/cron.daily
[01:53] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : raid0, but that doesnt matter, i just want to know if ubuntu supports that soft raid controller or not, because on my last (64bit) installation it didnt support it
[01:53] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i've not had to tinker with fstab before to mount and access a partition so why now, is all i'm asking
[01:54] <dcordes> hello? i bet there are many people here who know how i do this
[01:54] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: ok, crazy stuff going on there. One sec. You want to mount a disk on another disk?
[01:54] <poolkey172> tomyeah : cool I just installed RAID0 : kubuntu boots up in 18seconds : got bootchart logs to prove it
[01:54] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: because perhaps before you had a tool that put it into fstab for you
[01:54] <dcordes> don't let me swim like this. i allready helped many ppl here
[01:54] <apokryphos> !repeat
[01:54] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[01:54] <gunfus> I am restoring my cron.daily, (don't ask) so can someone give me a listing of their /etc/cron.daily
[01:54] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : do you use nvraid ?
[01:54] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: what do you want to be mounted on /home?
[01:55] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: yea, i want to mount sda1 unto sdb1
[01:55] <poolkey172> tomyeah : no dmraid
[01:55] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i want to access the /home dir of sda1 in sdab1
[01:55] <poolkey172> tomyeah : create the raid from the the BIOS then dmraid to get them recognised
[01:55] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: but it works with mount points. Firstly what do you want to be mounted as /home
[01:56] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: things about "the home dir of..." we have to deal with after.
[01:56] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i don't quite understand you
[01:56] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : i dont want to create or edit any raid, i dont even want to boot from the raid, i just want to mount it ...
[01:56] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: and, can you also pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l ?
[01:56] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i've done sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
[01:56] <eneried> hello boys? is there something better than xmms in edgy?
[01:56] <poolkey172> lol @ tomyeah then u r in luck that is EASY
[01:56] <apokryphos> eneried: yes
[01:56] <apokryphos> !players
[01:56] <ubotu> Audio (Ogg, MP3...) players: Banshee, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Rhythmbox, XMMS (GTK/Gnome based) and Amarok, JuK (Qt/KDE based).  Video players: Totem, Xine, MPlayer, VLC, Kaffeine  -  See also !codecs
[01:57] <eneried> woa!
[01:57] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: so i should now be able to access sda1 from my /mnt point no?
[01:57] <apokryphos> eneried: I think, of those, amarok and banshee are the best.
[01:57] <eneried> thanks a lot!
[01:57] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: well, you haven't specified options. So no saying if a user could access it etc. Could you pastebin that other stuff? Then I can start showing you what you need in fstab
[01:57] <tomyeah> poolkey172 : on boot the filesystem check crashes on the raid partitions ...
[01:58] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: fdisk output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34534/
[01:58] <eneried> i used xmms for a long time, because it resembles winamp, but I like something better now
[01:59] <poolkey172> tomyeah : lol unlucky mate : ps I was not even able to get a full install onto raid I had to hack around and copy an install onto a RAID and then post configure it
[01:59] <poolkey172> tomyeah : apt-get install dmraid
[01:59] <dcordes> poolkey172: he is not here
[02:00] <poolkey172> tomyeah : ubiquity and debian-installer were unable to install to RAID so I copied a whole system to it :o
[02:00] <poolkey172> tomyeah : what do u mean not here ?
[02:00] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: what's sda6?
[02:01] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: another swap partition it looks like, dunno
[02:01] <dcordes> apokryphos: Can you tell me where i can find the file where the entries of Settings/Session/Startup are stored?
[02:01] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: installing os over time its created more swaps than necessary?
[02:01] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: you should be using the previous swaps when installing another OS though. But hey.
[02:01] <apokryphos> dcordes: don't use gnome, sorry.
[02:01] <Richard__> I'm trying to connect two of my computer together - one ubuntu and one xp. They are both connected to the internets via a modem with a built in switch. And they both have been assigned individual external IPs.
[02:02] <Richard__> I can connect to them using browsers and/or netbios names, only IPs
[02:02] <dcordes> Richard__ i think when they are in a different subnetwork it won't be easy to connect them
[02:03] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: ok. Do this: sudo mkdir /mnt/sda1
[02:03] <Richard__> Awwww :'-(
[02:03] <dcordes>  anybody here using gnome who knows where the session startup programs are saved??
[02:03] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: done
[02:03] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: and then put this into your fstab: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34535/
[02:03] <dcordes> -_-
[02:03] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: then type sudo mount -a
[02:04] <cronholio> dcordes: system->preferences->sessions?

[02:08] <eneried> geeek edgy have some bugs, some stupid bugs, i like the interface, sutter than dapper, easier than dapper, but i don't like the bugs
[02:08] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: sudo mount -a doesn't work for me
[02:08] <yereth> which firewall would you recommend when I use my server as a gateway / router between my network and my modem / router?
[02:09] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: what does it say

[02:09] <livingdaylig> i needed to pastebin that
[02:09] <livingdaylig> yea :| sorry
[02:10] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: erm, make sure you don't leave the numbers when you copy to the file, right?
[02:10] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: be careful to follow things properly when using fstab :)
[02:10] <daxxar> How can I, in a shellscript, expand a pattern like a{b,c}?
[02:10] <eneried> and about video players, which are the best?
[02:11] <chaelot|work> vlc <3 :)
[02:11] <daxxar> I.e. in a variable.
[02:11] <apokryphos> eneried: vlc totem and kaffeine are all good
[02:11] <chaelot|work> is it a known issue that "gkrellm" (that system stats output thing) really slows down the puter ?
[02:12] <eneried> vlc, totem and kaffeine... what about xxx-xine?
[02:12] <apokryphos> eneried: if you're using totem use xine, yes
[02:12] <apokryphos> same with kaffeine of course
[02:12] <fourat> tryed to upgrade, it's stopping on an error saying that it cannot install pppconfig_2.3.15_all.deb because it is going to replace this file /usr/share/man/fr/man8/pppconfig.8.gz wich is from another package (manpages-fr), how to force it ?
[02:13] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: ok, i did mount -a
[02:13] <apokryphos> no errors?
[02:13] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: no, it had been my misstake again with the numbers as you intuited
[02:13] <orgy> somebody knows a tool which can recover hidden passwords out of login boxes, i lost my dsl connection password, but its still on the router :(
[02:14] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: ok, now ls /mnt/sda1
[02:14] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: ok,
=== linuxboy_ is now known as linuxboy
[02:14] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: and cd /home
[02:15] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: ok, so your sda1 is now mounted. What do you want to mount as /home?
[02:15] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: yes
[02:15] <JuJuBee> Can someone suggest a program that will let me edit pdf?
[02:16] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: if i do cd /home/conrad i'm back in the old sdb1 it seems. This is the problem i was getting before
[02:17] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: yeah, we haven't dealt with that yet. You haven't said what you want to be mounted as /home yet
[02:17] <Leeds2> quick question... is there a tool I should be using rather than editing /etc/fstab manually?
[02:17] <dcordes> how can i install a program bypassing the pubkey?
[02:17] <eneried> JuJuBee there's something called... pdftools or something like that, but they're command line tools, i don't remember the name, but they're command line tools
[02:18] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i just want to get my /home directory from sda1 so i can completely reformat sda1 and do a fresh install of my choice
[02:18] <poolkey172> anyone know where the x logs are for a session ?
[02:18] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: so you want to copy it to sdb1?
[02:18] <JuJuBee> eneried : thanks , but looking for gui.  SOmething like word processor.
[02:18] <apokryphos> poolkey172: /var/log
[02:18] <Leeds2> I'm setting up a machine for someone - on my own (slackware) machine, I'd just edit, but I'm trying to keep it clean and GUI on his machine
[02:18] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: yes, please ! :D
[02:18] <poolkey172> thanks
[02:18] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: well, they're both mounted now aren't they? So just copy the stuff over.
[02:18] <fourat> tryed to upgrade, it's stopping on an error saying that it cannot install pppconfig_2.3.15_all.deb because it is going to replace this file /usr/share/man/fr/man8/pppconfig.8.gz wich is from another package (manpages-fr), how to force it ?
[02:19] <Jaak_> I've installed beryl, when i reboot and log in, the first couple of sec everything is ok, but when beryl is loaded (jewel logo apears) gnome freezes, except for my mouse pointer. The 2hd icons on my desktop dissapear...Is there anyone with a solution or some pointers on what to do?
[02:19] <apokryphos> fourat: apt-get -f install. Though I'm presuming you didn't follow the guide for upgrading.....
[02:19] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i don't know when i was in kubuntu using konqueror it was as simple as clicking on and copying over. The thing is i don't even see the /home folder here
[02:19] <apokryphos> Jaak_: /msg ubotu beryl
[02:19] <eneried> JuJuBee try looking at sourceforge.net, maybe there's something new there
[02:19] <defrysk> !beryl > Jaak_
[02:20] <Jaak_> !beryl
[02:20] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:20] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: you don't see anything in /dev/sda1 ?
[02:20] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: well i see bin, cdrom etc initand so on and including home but when i open it i am back in sdb1
[02:20] <fourat> apokryphos, wich guide please
[02:21] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: can i not use nautilus to 'see' and copy over what i want from sda1's /home folder?
[02:21] <apokryphos> fourat: check the FAQ in channel topic
[02:21] <Leeds2> so there's no GUI tool for maintaining /etc/fstab?
[02:21] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: oh.. give me an ls -lh /mnt/sda1/

[02:25] <poolkey172> apokryphos : hmmm where do I stick that ?
[02:25] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: agues
[02:25] <apokryphos> poolkey172: in the shell
[02:25] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: huh?
[02:26] <romeozor> i need some help, i installed ubuntu (next to a windows) and the boot fails at waiting fot root filesystem and it drops me in a shell saying /dev/sda2 (root fs) does not exist, anyone know a fix?
[02:26] <poolkey172> apokryphos : That'll just set up an x instance from uid it's running under : cant this be global via the gdm or kdm ?
[02:26] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i mean yes, i would have preferred to see it and take out exactly what i want but as it is i will be more than happy if i can recover everything and then edit later
[02:27] <poolkey172> apokryphos : ie from when x starts initially
[02:27] <v21> you install UBUNTU  on another partition ? ?
[02:27] <apokryphos> poolkey172: I believe gdm can only run one x session
[02:27] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: i worry that i can't see anything of sda1's home/conrad
[02:27] <poolkey172> apokryphos : hmmm ic : then how would I connect to Xorg :1 -ac ?
[02:27] <romeozor> i did, sda1 is win, sda2 is root and sda3 is swap
[02:27] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: so navigate around with ls
[02:28] <apokryphos> poolkey172: independently
[02:28] <apokryphos> poolkey172: ctrl+alt+f8
[02:28] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: the other folders give me stuff just not /home/conrad

[02:29] <Jazzinghen> Can someone help me?
[02:29] <Leeds2> I know how to use fscking IRC, and I've been doing IRC supprt for years - I'd have expected at least an RTFM before now
[02:29] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: cp /mnt/sda1/home/conrad /sdb1/home/conrad ?

[02:29] <ubotu> Jazzinghen: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[02:29] <apokryphos> poolkey172: run an x session on a remote machine but output to somewhere else?
[02:29] <Jazzinghen> Ok
[02:29] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: with -r in there, yeah
[02:29] <poolkey172> apokryphos : correct
[02:29] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: where does the -r go after cp?
[02:29] <Jazzinghen> I have a copy of Borland JBuilder 2006 and I'd like to install it because I need it for University
[02:30] <klm-> how can I make xchat to automatically accept download of files from a certain user?
[02:30] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: anywhere
[02:30] <openexit> anyone know much about xtdesk I'm trying to disable the right click/properties of icons so you cant click on them at all
[02:30] <Jazzinghen> The problem is that when I try to install (Using the bin, as stated on the Borland Readme) it tells me that there are problems with the libc
[02:30] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: sudo cp -r /mnt/sda1/home/conrad /sdb1/home/conrad?
[02:30] <apokryphos> poolkey172: hm, I'm really not sure. Maybe play around with the DISPLAY variable?
[02:30] <Manse> can xchat be so powerful?
[02:30] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: right
[02:30] <apokryphos> Manse: for what?
[02:31] <openexit> im also trying to do the same with blackbox, disable the right click
[02:31] <apokryphos> Manse: it's a pretty decent client. Scriptable
[02:31] <poolkey172> apokryphos : I used to do this years back I just forgot
[02:31] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: what does the -r arguement do then?

[02:31] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: to allow you to copy folders.See man cp
[02:31] <defrysk> recursively
[02:31] <apokryphos> right
[02:32] <Jazzinghen> Anyone can help me, please?
=== SteveC is now known as ssssss
[02:32] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: lol, cp: cannot create directory  /sdb1/home/conrad : no such file or directory
[02:33] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: remove the "/sdb1"
[02:33] <neuro_> Jazzinghen: ask your question, then everyone else will be able to figure out if they can help you or not :)
[02:33] <shodanjr_gr> hey guys
[02:33] <defrysk> klm-, you can set it to accept or not accept from all users , however you can also save nicknames in filenames so you can see from who the upload is coming
[02:33] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: aha
[02:33] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: sudo cp -rv /mnt/sda1/home/conrad /home/conrad
[02:33] <Jazzinghen> Well
[02:33] <Jazzinghen> I've stated it
[02:33] <shodanjr_gr> i got a process running in the background, whats the bash command to bring it to the foreground?
[02:33] <Jazzinghen> So I'll repost it:
[02:33] <poolkey172> fg
[02:33] <Jazzinghen> I have a copy of Borland JBuilder 2006 and I'd like to install it because I need it for University, the problem is that when I try to install (Using the bin, as stated on the Borland Readme) it tells me that there are problems with the libc
[02:34] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : fg
[02:34] <klm-> defrysk: ok. I thought if it was possible to somehow script it to accept only from one person, but of course in ubuntu it's not as hazardous as on windows
[02:34] <shodanjr_gr> and how do i use it poolkey172? is it fg <PID>?
[02:34] <poolkey172> Dont u just love the simple questiions
[02:34] <daniel789> Hello people,
[02:34] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : just fg
[02:34] <shodanjr_gr> fg gives me "No such job"
[02:35] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : ahhh thats because u didnt put in the background
[02:35] <njan> klm-, it's no less hazardous accepting file transfers from other users in ubuntu than windows.
[02:35] <daniel789> I like this ogg music codec :-D, the makers did think about the common birate's and ogg does better
[02:35] <defrysk> klm-, as far as virusses is concerned no, perhaps you can search for script/plugins for this (google)
[02:35] <klm-> njan: yea but ubuntu users are more friendly
[02:35] <njan> klm-, either way you're at risk from exploits in the IRC client, and in either instance people can send you dubious content.
[02:35] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: it hasn't copied anythign over
[02:35] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: any errors?
[02:36] <shodanjr_gr> poolkey172 what i did was that i started a WGet via SSH and then just alt+f4'd putty
[02:36] <njan> klm-, who says the person sending you a file is going to be an ubuntu user?
[02:36] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: as i say fro some reason it is not reading /home/conrad
[02:36] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: no,
[02:36] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : start process; press ctrl-z (which pauses it); type 'bg' puts it in the background; fg back in the foreground
[02:36] <defrysk> Jazzinghen, might be wise to send the output of the failing install to pastebin
[02:36] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: "not reading"?
[02:36] <eneried> Does somebody how to install the mp3 support to amarok and banshee??
[02:36] <daniel789> here read something about microshaft , http://100777.com/node/1120
[02:36] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: the thing with sda1 is that on login/bootup it was not accepting my username/password
[02:36] <shodanjr_gr> poolkey172 is there a way to bring my wget back up? to check its progress?
[02:37] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: that is why i'm tryintg to recover my /home/dir
[02:37] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: your sdb1 actually isn't mounted anywhere
[02:37] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : ps -ef | grep -i wget
[02:37] <klm-> njan: sorry, I meant linux users. Who would try to harm a linux system? no point at all!
[02:37] <Jazzinghen> defrysk: Would you like to see the Output?
[02:37] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: sudo mkdir /mnt/sdb1 && sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1
[02:37] <defrysk> Jazzinghen, the people who might know what to do about it need it
[02:37] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : I got the feeling your wgets dies when u ALT-f4'd the parent ;)
[02:37] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: by reading i meant as i was saying earlier that nothing shows up in /home/conrad even though there is about 2.3gb of data in there
[02:37] <neuro_> shodanjr_gr: why can't you just kill the wget process then run it again with -c to continue?
[02:37] <njan> klm-, all kinds of people try and harm linux systems.
[02:37] <daniel789> well linux is more secure because linux is not designed to have potential security weaknesses nor is designed to suck up spyware like windowsa
[02:37] <Jazzinghen> Ok, I'll paste it here
[02:38] <defrysk> no!!!
[02:38] <defrysk> not here

[02:38] <daniel789> scroll up
[02:38] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: let me know if that gives any errors
[02:38] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: having done your mkdri command try and copy again?
[02:38] <njan> klm-, linux may have fewer viruses and spyware, but that doesn't mean no-one ever tries to break into linux systems - in point of fact, linux systems are great for relaying spam and doing other dubious thing, precisely because linux an efficient and flexible server platform.
[02:38] <livingdaylig> apokryphos: no that came back without errors
[02:39] <Parallax> hi, I hybernated my laptop and now that I turned on again I have no sound !!!!
[02:39] <poolkey172> shodanjr_gr : not sure if you can attach them to a terminal : I used to know how to do this
[02:39] <daniel789> thats because linux is not designed like windows to suck up spyware,
[02:39] <njan> klm-, you'll find that there are a lot of compromised linux machines out there alongside the windows ones being used for spam and all manner of other things.
[02:39] <apokryphos> livingdaylig: now type sudo cp -r /mnt/sda1/home/conrad /mnt/sdb1/.

[02:40] <apokryphos> yup
[02:40] <apokryphos> though it doesn't make a difference in this case; just a habbit :P
[02:40] <klm-> njan, ok. ubuntu is still quite safe by default installation?
[02:40] <apokryphos> klm-: yes
[02:40] <apokryphos> !firewall
[02:40] <njan> klm-, yes, ubuntu has a very safe default installation.
[02:40] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[02:40] <defrysk> klm-, yes
[02:40] <daniel789> what firewall do you guys recommend for ubuntu?
[02:40] <njan> klm-, but there are certain things that are still risky, like opening your client up for DCC file transfers. DCC/CTCP in IRC is something which historically has had a bad track record, in windows and in linux.
[02:40] <defrysk> daniel789, read above
[02:40] <apokryphos> daniel789: you shouldn't have to change anything from the default

[02:42] <cheesy> thanks

[02:47] <reverseblade> livingdaylig, I know these days, very tiring and desperate
[02:47] <njan> daniel789, that doesn't really answer the question, you've basically just stated windows insecure and made an intangible appeal to freebsd being secure without actually backing up the assertion.

[03:00] <Hattori> where should JAVA_HOME be located usually?
[03:00] <cox377> is there a command to list all applications
[03:00] <njan> poolkey172, the hostname command, or edit /etc/hostname
[03:01] <njan> cox377, at the command line, hit tab twice.

[03:02] <cox377> njan: Umm i just saw it during shutdown, but there is nothing under apps
[03:02] <monkeybutter> I found themes but nothing to change colors of widgets
[03:02] <DeepThoughts> Hi! A buddy of mine is trying to install the latest ubuntu (alternate CD) but when he tries to resize the partition it only shows him a blank blue window and a text-entry row but no text. What to do?
[03:02] <Hattori> how can i locate the dir where is installed JAVA?
[03:02] <njan> cox377, no, it's definitely a service - you'll find the shortcuts that start services in /etc/init.d/
[03:03] <cox377> njan: do u manually delete?
[03:03] <njan> cox377, there's a GUI app for managing services (although I forget the name), or you can use something like rcconf to manage whch services automagically start at the command line.
[03:03] <njan> cox377, no, don't delete the file from there
[03:03] <cox377> njan: is rrconf installed by default?
[03:03] <JuJuBee> OK, I found a few pdf editors.  I tried to install pdfedit and got an error... configure: error: You need boost library to compile PDFedit

[03:04] <daniel789> well i tryed this, sudo dpkg -NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7184-pkg1.run asks for password but does not seem to input letters
[03:04] <monkeybutter> Is there a wayto change the colors in ubuntu? Orange is nice but...
[03:04] <njan> cox377, no, you'll have to apt-get install rcconf. You can manually edit the shortcuts in /etc/R*.d/, but you're as well apt-get installing rcconf and using that, it's a useful tool.
[03:04] <shadukan> is there any dedicated room for installin drivers for motherboards?
[03:04] <cox377> njan: installing now, will it show up under the applications?
[03:04] <njan> cox377, no, it's a command line application.
[03:05] <incorrect> are there any more gnome themes packaged?
[03:05] <shadukan> cause i have installed sucessfuly the fglrx driver in my IBM X31 Thinkpad but i get an strange error
[03:05] <njan> cox377, like I said, there's a GUI app for managing which services start at boot time in ubuntu's menus somewhere, but I couldn't tell you what it is, because I don't use it.
[03:05] <cox377> njan: ok, well i';ve install rcconf, how do i launch it?
[03:05] <njan> cox377, run a terminal, and type 'rcconf'
[03:05] <Hattori> how can i locate the dir where is installed JAVA?
[03:06] <njan> cox377, there's a terminal link in the applications menu or you can alt+F2, type gnome-terminal, hit return.
[03:06] <monkeybutter> Hattori: locate java.exe
[03:06] <monkeybutter> Hattori: ...on the command line
[03:06] <JuJuBee> Can anybody assist with this error ? configure: error: You need boost library to compile PDFedit
[03:06] <cox377> njan: sorry mate, what i mean is how do u launch rcconf?
[03:07] <Hattori> monkeybutter: how?
[03:07] <njan> cox377, type rcconf at the commandline.
[03:08] <cox377> njan: cheers for that
[03:08] <njan> cox377, np.
[03:08] <monkeybutter> Hattori: open a terminal and type "locate java.exe" it will list the paths of all the files named java.exe
[03:08] <njan> cox377, the debian/ubuntu runlevel system can be a bit tricky to manage by hand, rcconf is useful to have.

[03:10] <Rprp> ./jre-1_5_0_09-linux-amd64.bin: line 310: ./install.sfx.6759: cannot execute binary file
[03:10] <Rprp> How can i fix that?
[03:10] <apokryphos> !java
[03:10] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[03:10] <eneried> i have a question. I have a program and i don't need it anymore, i want to delete it, but i want to delete the dependencies of the program, i don't want a lot of packages i don't need anymore, how to do it?
[03:11] <tomyeah> these news told me that ubuntu 6.10 has AIGLX and compiz preinstalled ....
[03:11] <monkeybutter> tryggvib: ah! sorry Hattori
[03:11] <apokryphos> Tomcat_: aiglx, yes, compiz -- no.
[03:12] <Tomcat_> tomyeah: If you want eyecandy, search Google for "berylonedgy". It's quite easy and runs well. :)
[03:13] <j0n0> Hi, how to set hostname via dhcp?
[03:13] <eneried> nobody reads me?
[03:13] <daniel789> it takes more brain power to figure this one out.. http://img302.imageshack.us/img302/1772/screenshotvv3.png
[03:13] <sittisal> eneried,
[03:13] <sittisal> you should use aptitude
[03:13] <eneried> hello
[03:13] <poolkey172> can someone tell me what runlevels lo and network should be in : my network doesnt autostart
[03:14] <monkeybutter> Hattori: try a locate keytool - this is in the JRE
[03:14] <Tomcat_> j0n0: send host-name "<yourhost>" in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[03:14] <Hattori> i'm actually installing sun-java5-jre
[03:14] <sittisal> every program installed with aptitude, (sudo aptitude install foo)
[03:14] <Hattori> with apt-get
[03:14] <eneried> i want to uninstall some program, that's ok. but that program depends on a lot of packages that i don't need, i don't like programs leaving garbage on my systenm, how can i delete those packages?
[03:14] <apokryphos> aptitude or autoremove

[03:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about autoremove - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:15] <eneried> synaptic does too, aptitude... um
[03:15] <apokryphos> actually, I'm not sure if that supports anything more than the basic ubuntu-desktop package. Will check the man page
[03:15] <daniel789> ty
[03:15] <monkeybutter> eneried: aptitude will remove automatically installed packages for you later
[03:15] <eneried> ah
[03:15] <poolkey172> can anyone help please or check their install ?
[03:16] <sittisal> monkeybutter, aptitude keep tracks of installed package and recursive remove dependencie that are not used by other programs
[03:16] <sittisal> eneried, aptitude keep tracks of installed package and recursive remove dependencie that are not used by other programs
[03:16] <sittisal> sorrt :-P
[03:16] <der0b> I've lost my mind today..  what's the command to list the installed hardware?
[03:16] <Chill3r> hello everyone - im wondering if somebody could help with a little problem i have
[03:16] <monkeybutter> der0b: lspci?
[03:16] <daniel789> thank you for this graphics driver link,
[03:17] <poolkey172> Chill3r : ask away
[03:17] <der0b> monkeybutter: thank you..  I couldn't remember it for the life of me
[03:17] <eneried> for example, i don't want to use... abiword anymore, and anymore depends on some libraries, i don't need those libraries, i need space for using openoffice or koffice instead, then i remove it wioth aptitude and aptitude automatically remove the useless packages?
[03:17] <brianski> if i want to run a 64 bit kernel with 32 bit userland, is that just a simple matter of installing the proper 64 bit kernel, or would i need to do some other magic to get the 32 bit executables working?
[03:17] <sittisal> eneried, in fact if you install kubuntu-desktop with aptitude you can remove it with all dependencies that it brings
[03:17] <sittisal> except these used by ubuntu-desktop
[03:17] <Lynoure> der0b: lshw  is nice too
[03:17] <php1> Hallo !?
[03:17] <poolkey172> can someone tell me what runlevels lo and network should be in : my network doesnt autostart pretty please ?
[03:17] <Chill3r> i have a mini tosh laptop - its only an old thing - currently windows 98 - i want to install ubuntu on it - but it has no physical network connection or cd rom , floppy
[03:17] <poplars> hey guys, I need a way to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade after sudo apt-get update . . . can anyone give me a command?
[03:17] <Lynoure> der0b: and in future,  apropos hardware  can be handy :)
[03:17] <php1> oh, sorry
[03:18] <brianski> poplars: uh, apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[03:18] <Chill3r> i have wirless on it an worls fine  can anybody point me in the right direction ?
[03:18] <eneried> aaa, but if i delete for example, um totem, totem uses gstreamer plugins, and i don't need them anymore, cause i use.... um... w32cocecs instead
[03:18] <eneried> when i delete totem all gstreamer plugins remains n system
[03:18] <poplars> brianski, I think I just found a command,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:18] <eneried> aptitude delete them for me?
[03:18] <poplars> how big is the whole upgrade for edgy from dapper? lol
[03:18] <poplars> I'm on dialup so this actually matters to me (sadly)
[03:19] <sittisal> eneried, yes if you installed totem via aptitude :-P
[03:19] <looksaus> anyone has experience here with installing ubuntu on a usb key on powerpc?
[03:19] <Chill3r> is there somsort of local install from windows that can be done ?
[03:19] <eneried> poplars? if dapper is working well in your machine just update some dapper-backports instead
[03:19] <eneried> edgy is ok, but the upgrade is painful
[03:19] <j0n0> Tomcat_: I'm trying, thank you
[03:20] <Chill3r> anybody ?  local install of ubuntu from windows - as i havnt got cd drive or floppy drive - but got wirless connection via pcmcia
[03:22] <jrib> ubotu: tell Chill3r about install
[03:22] <eneried> poplars, i think there's only three big things upgrading from dapper to edgy 1. firefox, 2. best support on hibertation (if you install edgy and not upgrade it from dapper) 3. easy to install ntfs read write support
[03:22] <jrib> Chill3r: not sure if any of the methods on that apge will work for you, but look it over
[03:22] <eneried> nothing more
[03:23] <sittisal> eneried, upstart
[03:23] <Chill3r> thanks dude
[03:23] <poplars> eneried, yeah, upstart too.
[03:23] <sittisal> 30 second to boot :-P
[03:23] <poplars> :)
[03:23] <poplars> I wont mind, I'm a hacker so
[03:23] <poplars> when I get time I'll dedicate a few hours to fixing it up.
[03:23] <eneried> what is upstart?
[03:23] <poplars> its like a boot manager.
[03:23] <poplars> supports high quality boot screens
[03:23] <poplars> increases boot up time
[03:23] <daniel789> on this synaptic manager where you select the kernal, whats the most up to date kernal number for ubuntu dapper drake, plus im on p4 .
[03:23] <poplars> I'm pretty sure that's what OSX uses.
[03:24] <poplars> (and osx boots in like 20 seconds, btw)
[03:24] <gavi1> I can't find anything on how to mount with xubuntu, and all of the command line instructions i can find are for dappy (I'm on edgy). help?
[03:24] <sittisal> poplars, yeah it similar to launchd
[03:24] <eneried> i have to check it hehe
[03:24] <eneried> :)
[03:24] <titan> howzit, can anyone hlp me with terminal server and tsclient?
[03:24] <jrib> gavi1: should be the same, what filesystem is it?
[03:24] <eneried> ok 4 big things
[03:24] <gavi1> jrib: ext3
[03:24] <poplars> lol
[03:24] <poplars> eneried, cons?
[03:24] <poplars> other then the fact that everythign is bleeding edge.
[03:24] <gavi1> the file listing the mounts changed for edgy right?
[03:25] <shadukan> howdy again
[03:25] <sittisal> poplars, artwork
[03:25] <poplars> sweet
[03:25] <sittisal> poplars, vnc bugs
[03:25] <reverseblade> gavil , they are all the same, just go with wiki
[03:25] <Chill3r> umm trying to grab Loadlin but links out on ubuntu page anybody got a working one
[03:25] <shadukan> can i ask again if there is a dedicate chat room for drivers installation?
[03:25] <jrib> gavi1: just create a mount point, and mount -t ext3 /dev/foo /path/to/mountpoint,  add to fstab if you want it to be permanent.  Are the instructions you have now good enough for you?
[03:25] <poplars> I'd rather not use Compiz/Beryl, and all that crap, produced way too many problems with the inneffeciency of it.
[03:25] <reverseblade> gavi1, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[03:25] <daniel789> look at this, its about nvidia drivers, http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/8571/screenshot1iy0.png which one im on the dapper drake ubuntu up to date which kernal version
[03:25] <sittisal> and mono
[03:25] <daniel789> p4 to
[03:25] <eneried> ok, you're selling me edgy ;) i'll become buying it from you
[03:25] <eneried> :P
[03:26] <gavi1> reverseblade: wiki only has instructions for ubuntu, using the graphical mouunter in gnome, im on xubuntu
[03:26] <gavi1> i think...
[03:26] <reverseblade> gavi1, No
[03:26] <sittisal> Edgy worst things: Mono (beagle, f-spot, tomboy)
[03:26] <reverseblade> gavi1, just follow the link I have given
[03:26] <gavi1> mmm, ok ill check again, sorry

[03:26] <eneried> f-spot is the image viewer?
[03:27] <sittisal> eneried, yes
[03:27] <eneried> i wish an image viewer working closer than ACDSee
[03:27] <daniel789> okay guess ill just click one of these..
[03:27] <eneried> f-spot is not good enough
[03:27] <sittisal> it's simple (not as iPhoto)
[03:27] <_maney> hmmm.... anyone know where the X man pages have gone to?
[03:27] <sittisal> but try to recursive modify tags or metadata...
[03:27] <poplars> its amazing how ignorance can stop people from doing things, lol
[03:28] <sittisal> with 500 photos (very few)
[03:28] <eneried> there's an ACDSee alternative on linux?
[03:28] <sittisal> it tooks ages
[03:28] <sittisal> ender, gthumb (gnome)
[03:28] <sittisal> ops

[03:35] <daniel789> wow..so you don't actually have to bother going to nvidias website with this package management?
[03:35] <Lin> i got a weird problem with cd-rom drives. Im using ubuntu edgy, when I insert a disk on drive it isn't automaticly mounted. Then I go to Places->Computer and double click on cd-rom driver  icon. Nothing happens (in terminal I notice that CDROM is mounted in this time). When I click again in CD-ROM Drive it just tell me: CD-ROM is already mounted or busy. But didn' t opens it. Using a terminal to do cd /cdrom works flawlessly.  Using CTRL+L to open location work
[03:35] <Lin> s too. The CD-ROM icon didn't appear on nautilus desktop. Any help is welcome

[03:37] <gavi1> ok, i've mounted a partition to protect my backups while i reinstall xubuntu (and format the rest of the harddrive). will the partition be mounted in the same place even after i reinstall? or do i have to mount it again? could anything be lost?
[03:37] <cox377> poolkey172: wireless or wired?
[03:37] <dabaR> Lin: show me your fstab on a pastebin, please
[03:37] <poolkey172> wired
[03:37] <Lin> I forgot to put fstab here ..
[03:37] <poolkey172> cox377 : wired
[03:37] <Lin> dabaR: I will put it on paste bin
[03:37] <dabaR> gavi1: well, it may even be mounted on the same spot, where is it mounted now?
[03:38] <gavi1>  /optacle
[03:38] <gavi1> :  /
[03:38] <dabaR> gavi1: then it likely will not be mounted in the same spot. Sometimes the installer will mount all the /dev/X to /media/X not sure what it will do in you case.
[03:39] <gavi1> dabaR: ok, that's ok. but will the files be safe?
[03:39] <dabaR> poolkey172: do you know how to get your Internet connection working and want us to tell you how to make it automatic, or do you need to get it working too>?
[03:39] <_maney> never mind, found the man pages I needed on a box that's still running Debian.  maybe I need to do that more...
[03:40] <daniel789> where can i locate nvidias drivers if they are installed i want to go to 1280x1024 res
[03:40] <dabaR> gavi1: well, as long as you do not overwrite them all you have an OK chance of that.
[03:40] <Lin> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34545/

[03:44] <Lin> it didn't automount it.
[03:44] <cox377> daniel789: do u know how to edit the xorg?

[03:45] <NET||abuse> it doesn't seem to inherit the local dns settings from networks in /etc/resolv.conf when i go from work to home or vice versa

[03:49] <Chill3r> anybody ?  seems a few problems with this guide - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows
[03:49] <LjL> eXp|Dwark^, what i can give you is this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/39315 - i solved the problem by removing plptools in dapper (but i didn't have the problem in edgy). seems like an escaping bug that's due to... who knows. you could try the many suggestions that there are on that report
[03:49] <dabaR> Lin: It took me a while to find what I had in mind... Desktop/gnome/volume_manager, check the automount_media key, it may be off:-/
[03:50] <eXp|Dwark^> LjL thx.. :) ill try

[03:52] <DreamerHxC> hi all
[03:52] <titan> kleinlappies, where did you get vm?
[03:53] <dabaR> Lin: try gnome-volume-properties, that may give you some option, and if not, try running gnome-volume-manager in a terminal. Not really solutions, but that is what I can think of. I am off, see ya.
[03:53] <jah^> anyone know about getting hydra working then?
[03:53] <reverseblade> kleinlappies, what exactly do you want ?
[03:53] <gavi1> I've followed the directions for mounting a partition on the ubuntu wiki, but even though it lists it in mount as r/w, i can't create/copy any files to it. anybody know what my problem is?
[03:53] <jah^> or how to fix make errors referring to stdio.h etc? do I need to install a certain package for the devel headers?

[03:55] <gavi1> reverseblade: and its empty (except for t he lost+found folder)
[03:55] <reverseblade> gavi1, there are other tutorials for mount in the wiki.
[03:55] <LjL> eXp|Dwark^, err... if the keyboard problem is that bad for you, i really don't know =) you could try recovery mode, as that shouldn't ask you for a password. it will also not load most services, so perhaps the problem won't be present there
[03:55] <reverseblade> gavi1, does it have rw persmission for all ?
[03:55] <njan> tx, indeed, yeah, that works, but only in vim, not in vi :)
[03:56] <daniel789> well it says in synaptic package manager that i do have nvidia graphics drivers installed

[04:03] <reverseblade> gavi1, depending on your requirements. Having that said 755 is the defacto standard . But that depends as I told
[04:04] <reverseblade> kleinlappies, are you using vmware now ?
[04:04] <gavi1> reverseblade: ok, i think i get it. thanks again.

[04:04] <kleinlappies> yes, my windows is running on it. vmware is instaled on ubuntu
[04:04] <soundray> poolkey172: ignore my last line. Can you login as user on a console?
[04:04] <reverseblade> eXp|Dwark^, is that happnens only while you are logging in ?
[04:04] <kleinlappies> reverseblade,  yes, my windows is running on it. vmware is instaled on ubuntu
[04:04] <Joakim> can someone help me?
[04:05] <poolkey172> soundray : yes I can ssh as well the uid is fine

[04:05] <IdleOne> Joakim ask your question
[04:05] <reverseblade> kleinlappies, have you installed vmware tools ?

[04:05] <eltese> Hi. Im thinking about installing and running Ubuntu on my computer with the purpose of getting rid of my windows partition. But in my previous installs Ive encountered some probs when actually running and trying to get optimized drivers for my graphics card as well getting my NTFS partition to work properly when in linux. I cant reach the files. So I wonder if anyone knows why it is so?
[04:05] <poolkey172> soundray : correct
[04:05] <soundray> poolkey172: what are the symptoms?
[04:05] <u01p2109> I have problem to install Riva TNT2 64MB
[04:06] <poolkey172> soundray : blackscreen - cursor - then back to kdm
[04:06] <reverseblade> kleinlappies, you may also consider increasing memory usage of the relevant vm in the config
[04:06] <eXp|Dwark^> reverseblade yes and if i get logged in it still does it..
[04:06] <reverseblade> eXp|Dwark^, how can you type now ?
[04:06] <jenda> How do I list all mounted devices?
[04:06] <soundray> poolkey172: have you looked at $HOME/.xsession-errors for logged messages?
[04:06] <poolkey172> soundray : yup
[04:06] <apokryphos> jenda: mount
[04:06] <kleinlappies> reverseblade, yes did all that. i suppose im going to get myself another gig of ram (that will help) i have like 1 and a half gigs of ram.

[04:07] <reverseblade> kleinlappies, with 256 mb ram, windows looks fine on my vm
[04:07] <soundray> eltese: NTFS is a closed filesystem. It is fairly difficult to develop free drivers for it. However, with recent versions of fuse, even NTFS read&write works reasonably well.
[04:07] <soundray> poolkey172: so?
[04:07] <dbe> Why cannot I chown a symlink with: sudo chown www-data /var/www   ?
[04:07] <eXp|Dwark^> reverseblade but i think ill just download 6.06 and install that and wait until they a comming up with a newer version that maybe works again.. :D
[04:07] <poolkey172> soundray : nothing is logged in it
[04:07] <eltese> soundray okay. And what is fuse? :)
[04:08] <reverseblade> eXp|Dwark^, peripherals like keyboard monitor are configured in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:08] <fulat2k> hi folks, any idea why my usb transfer is really slow even though i have a usb2 device + port?
[04:08] <soundray> eltese: regarding video drivers, the big names NVidia and ATI are kind of half-heartedly supporting free OSs.
[04:08] <poolkey172> SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhugar
[04:08] <fulat2k> it's like transferring at usb1 speeds
[04:08] <soundray> poolkey172: behave yourself
[04:08] <poolkey172> I think I see the problem
[04:08] <kleinlappies> reverseblade, i have given 400mb to my windows. there is nothing wrong with it just want it faster.
[04:08] <soundray> poolkey172: what is it then?
[04:08] <dbe> soundray, sudo chown www-data /var/www  to set www-data as owner to /var/www (which is a symlink), but why does it not work for me?
[04:08] <poolkey172> chmod time bigtime

[04:24] <reverseblade> jturek, oh ok
[04:24] <poolkey172> abhisk3k : oh well
[04:24] <jturek> i thought maybe gaim would have a plugin
[04:24] <jturek> but don't see one
[04:25] <soundray> abhish3k: in that case, I suggest you boot in recovery mode and reset the root passwd with 'passwd'
[04:25] <Joakim> Ok
[04:25] <reverseblade> jturek, although I love gaim, it is pretty weak on these matters
[04:25] <abhish3k> soundray: recovery mode needs root passwd
[04:25] <soundray> abhish3k: but you should really use root the ubuntu way, like ubotu msg'd you.
[04:25] <soundray> abhish3k: not on a standard setup.

[04:26] <poolkey172> Nov 28 14:56:09 rcS: ld_static: cannot open output file /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-g
[04:26] <poolkey172> eneric/volatile/fcdsl.ko: Read-only file system
[04:26] <soundray> abhish3k: if you have screwed up your installation like that, you should boot from a live CD
[04:26] <reverseblade> daniel789, there is a syntax error in your config file
[04:26] <abhish3k> soundray: i think that sounds nice
[04:26] <reverseblade> daniel789, no ignore what I said
[04:27] <Wyvern> Does Ubuntu Server come with X11 support? Keep getting "Error: Can't open display" when I'm trying to use X11-forwarding over SSH (yes, i used -X)
[04:27] <Wyvern> connecting to old Red Hat boxes works fine, but this ubuntu box just refuse to work. :(
[04:27] <soundray> abhish3k: from the live CD, mount your root partition to /mnt, run 'sudo gedit /etc/passwd' and replace the first line of that file with 'root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash'
[04:27] <soundray> abhish3k: after that, boot in recovery mode and use passwd to reset the root password.
[04:28] <abhish3k> soundray: work in progress
[04:28] <soundray> Wyvern: Ubuntu Server is without X by default
[04:28] <stefg> daniel789: did you 'sudo nvidia-glx-config enable'? You might have the driver, but to be used it needs to say 'driver nvidia' instead of 'driver nv' in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:28] <daniel789> ok
[04:29] <daniel789> yes i copy and pasted it
[04:29] <Wyvern> so it wouldn't support X11 on other displays either?
[04:29] <daniel789> as you see,
[04:29] <rausb0> Wyvern: check if X11Forwarding is allowed in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server
[04:29] <abhish3k> soundray: hats off for you
[04:29] <Wyvern> i've checked that allready, rausb0.
[04:29] <abhish3k> soundray: it worked
[04:29] <soundray> abhish3k: thanks. Please consider doing root the Ubuntu way.
[04:29] <rausb0> Wyvern: is xauth installed as well?
[04:29] <abhish3k> soundray: rox
[04:29] <Wyvern> ...
[04:30] <stefg> daniel789: what does glxinfo | grep direct yield?
[04:30] <abhish3k> soundray: well can i install KDE through live cd?
[04:30] <pdlnhrd> to upgrade to edgy  i am trying   gksudo "update-manager -d"  and it is not giving me the option to upgrade... is that the wrong command?
[04:30] <Wyvern> Ubuntu Server: Nothing Included?
[04:30] <soundray> Wyvern: what program are you trying to run remotely?
[04:30] <Wyvern> ehm, xclock for starters
[04:30] <abhish3k> abhish3k: using edgy right now
[04:30] <jeff2> when I try to update my system using the update notifier in gnome, I get "Only one software management tool is allowed to run at a the same time". I don't have aptitude or synaptic running. where are the lock files I can delete to make it so I can update my system?
[04:30] <Linuturk> @lamp
[04:30] <soundray> abhish3k: yes, but you need the kubuntu live CD
[04:31] <soundray> !lamp | Linuturk
[04:31] <ubotu> Linuturk: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[04:31] <abhish3k> soundray: i have it
[04:31] <Linuturk> thanks soundray
[04:31] <reverseblade> #off-topic: PHP sucks hard !
[04:31] <abhish3k> soundray: dont know how to use it for installing kde
[04:31] <daniel789> Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:31] <Wyvern> but installing xauth did the trick.
[04:31] <soundray> abhish3k: kubuntu = ubuntu + KDE
[04:31] <rausb0> Wyvern: ssh uses xauth to manage the display permissions
[04:31] <abhish3k> soundray: i know
[04:32] <soundray> abhish3k: kubuntu live will install KDE by default
[04:32] <daniel789> it said that > Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
[04:32] <daniel789> Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:32] <Wyvern> yeah, I have to admit i actually knew that, but I keep assuming that stuff is included. :P
[04:32] <Linuturk> soundray, will that work with edgy?
[04:32] <abhish3k> soundray: using ubuntu edgy
[04:32] <scythe128> why is it you can use the ubuntu install as a live cd and have kde but you cant install kde from the ubuntu install cd?
[04:32] <rausb0> Wyvern: okay :)
[04:32] <abhish3k> soundray: want ot install kde on ubuntu from kde live cd
[04:32] <soundray> abhish3k: to install KDE on an existing ubuntu system, do 'apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'
[04:33] <abhish3k> soundray: tried the command but not working
[04:33] <scythe128> soundray.. you can actually just type apt-get install kde and it will get everything also
[04:33] <soundray> abhish3k: can't do that. You need the kubuntu alternative CD to do that
[04:33] <abhish3k> soundray: from where can i get that?
[04:33] <soundray> abhish3k: you have to enable repositories
[04:33] <abhish3k> soundray: which repositories?
[04:34] <soundray> !repos | abhish3k
[04:34] <ubotu> abhish3k: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:35] <pdlnhrd> what is the proper command to do a dist upgrade? i am trying gksudo "update-manager -d"  and it is not giving option for upgrade
[04:35] <abhish3k> soundray: !repos | abhish3k means what?
[04:35] <dbe> pdlnhrd, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:35] <pdlnhrd> dbe: doesn't work either
[04:35] <soundray> abhish3k: it's an instruction to ubotu to send you info about repositories. Look ^^
[04:35] <rausb0> abhish3k: just read what ubotu said
[04:36] <dbe> pdlnhrd, Should do.
[04:36] <reverseblade> pdlnhrd, check : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades?highlight=%28upgrade%29
[04:36] <pdlnhrd> dbe: that is sort of why i am asking... i know it should
[04:36] <wikijeff> How can I have my wireless interface not be enabled when I startup my computer?? Thanks.
[04:36] <soundray> scythe128: kubuntu-desktop is a much more complete environment than just kde
[04:36] <abhish3k> soundray: ok
[04:36] <scythe128> really?  Ill have to go over to the kubuntu forum and ask some questions
[04:37] <scythe128> bbl
[04:37] <abhish3k> ubotu: ok
[04:37] <reverseblade> wikijeff, /etc/network
[04:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ok - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:37] <pdlnhrd> reverseblade:  thanks... i thought it was the -d switch...
[04:37] <quiet> with apache virtual hosts.... when i make new virtual host files...  is"NameVirtualHost" supposed to be the sitename, i.e. - fooar.com or the server's IP address and then specify the site name in <VirtualHost ....>  ?
[04:37] <samgee> join #ubuntu-classroom
[04:37] <soundray> wikijeff: edit '/etc/network/interfaces' and remove the line that says 'auto wlan0' (assuming that your wireless interface is called wlan0)
[04:37] <wikijeff> soundray, reverseblade: thanks
[04:38] <BlueEagle> quiet: You migth want to try #apache if you don't get any help with that here. Also have a look-see in the apache documentation. I'm told that it's quite comprehencive.
[04:38] <wikijeff> soundray: And then can I enable it while my computer is running with ifup ?
[04:38] <soundray> wikijeff: yes, 'sudo ifup wlan0'
[04:39] <quiet> BlueEagle, #apache generally won't give support because various distro's mangle apache from it's default form...
[04:39] <wikijeff> soundray: ok, thanks
[04:39] <reverseblade> wikijeff, not without modifying the same file again
[04:39] <BlueEagle> quiet: Then you might want to try the documentation.
[04:40] <wikijeff> reverseblade, soundray: I need to modify the same file again to enable it? I can't use ifup?
[04:40] <BlueEagle> quiet: /usr/share/doc/apache2/ might be a good place to start. :)
[04:40] <jorgp> is there a release of gnome 2.16.2 for edgy some place?
[04:40] <quiet> yes... thanks.
[04:40] <reverseblade> wikijeff, use dhclient instead of ifup, it is better generally
[04:40] <reverseblade> jorgp, no
[04:40] <rausb0> wikijeff: you can. reverseblade is wrong.
[04:40] <samu> How do you change what programs to auto-start when logging in to gnome?
[04:41] <samu> I got a tip to change the .xprofile
[04:41] <jorgp> reverseblade, wonder why
[04:41] <reverseblade> samu System > Preferences > Sessions > startup
[04:41] <rausb0> reverseblade: ifup will just call dhclient if the interface is set to dhcp in /etc/network/interfaces
[04:41] <samu> reverseblade, thanks
[04:41] <jr-gotti> !w32codecs
[04:41] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:41] <rausb0> reverseblade: so no reason for not using ifup
[04:42] <reverseblade> jorgp, because ubuntu has a development cycle of 6 months which is roughly synchronized with gnome. new version of ubuntu = new version of gnome usually
[04:42] <reverseblade> rausb0, I didn't know that, thanks
[04:42] <jorgp> reverseblade, but it would seem logical to stay up with latest stable for your current release
[04:43] <reverseblade> jorgp, not in deed, gnome is one of the core parts of ubuntu, so it is better to have a developer - touched edition rather than the standard one. I am sure it will work fine, but I wouldn't recommend it
[04:44] <daniel789> why is  sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum takeing time , when i enter it. when i type text in terminal my text is doubled
=== eno-zzz is now known as eno
[04:44] <poolkey172> still haven't worked out why my networking doesn't start at boottime :(
[04:44] <poolkey172> can anyone help me to debug it ?
[04:45] <monokrome> Can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file?
[04:45] <MrKeuner> hi, isn't banshee on edgy too slow. I was using it former release, and it was quite fast then. What happened?
[04:45] <poolkey172> monokrome : how do u pastebin ?
[04:45] <poolkey172> !pastebin
[04:45] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:46] <monokrome> :D
[04:46] <poolkey172> monokrome : its coming

[04:47] <poolkey172> monokrome : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34558/
[04:48] <monokrome> What network interface do you want brought up on startup?
[04:48] <poolkey172> monokrome : eth2
[04:48] <monokrome> hrm, using DHCP, I assume?
[04:48] <poolkey172> monokrome : but the strange thing is that I only have 1 interface : yup dhcp
[04:48] <Ji31> hei, mit kuuluu?
[04:49] <monokrome> Very peculiar.
[04:49] <soundray> wikijeff: 'sudo ifup wlan0' brings it up again. No editing required
[04:49] <poolkey172> monokrome : pastbining u dmesg | grep eth

[04:50] <poolkey172> monokrome : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34559/
[04:51] <monokrome> ifup eth2 brings up your network?
[04:51] <soundray> Ji31: is that Finnish or Czech?
[04:51] <poolkey172> monokrome : why does eth0 become eth2 is beyond me
[04:51] <Ji31> soundray: finnish
[04:51] <Wyvern> When trying to authenticate to the CUPS web-interface, the root user and password doesn't work as supposed to...
[04:51] <monokrome> What happens when you ifup eth0?

[04:52] <rausb0> poolkey172: check /etc/iftab
[04:52] <Wyvern> And the "fix" for this is to use lppasswd, which is not avalible even through apt-get, anyone know how to do this?
[04:52] <soundray> Ji31: Wie geht's? (de)
[04:52] <tuna-fish-> Here's a dumb newbie question: I just bought a dvd-burner and plugged it into my system. Ubuntu didn't automatically recognize it, how should  i proceed in installing it?
[04:52] <poolkey172> SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
[04:52] <Ji31> soundray: aha, but I don't speak de
[04:52] <thrice`> tuna-fish-, did you reboot ?
[04:53] <rausb0> poolkey172: i mean the file /etc/iftab
[04:53] <rausb0> poolkey172: check its contents
[04:53] <soundray> tuna-fish-: how is your drive connected?
[04:53] <tuna-fish-> pata
[04:53] <poolkey172> monokrome : rausb0 : ok
[04:54] <poolkey172> rausb0 : LOL and there lies my problem :) can I modify it and correct it ?
[04:54] <rausb0> poolkey172: yeah
[04:54] <monokrome> poolkey172: What happens when you ifup eth0?
[04:54] <soundray> tuna-fish-: did you set the jumpers correctly?
[04:54] <tuna-fish-> fstab entry for it is: /dev/hdb        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[04:54] <rausb0> poolkey172: i suppose you moved that linux system from one machine to another?
[04:54] <poolkey172> thanks rausb0 and monikrome :
[04:54] <soundray> tuna-fish-: so it should be jumpered as a slave
[04:54] <tuna-fish-> why?
[04:55] <poolkey172> rausb0 : Yeh have not been hearing the volume level coming from me ?
[04:55] <soundray> tuna-fish-: /dev/hdb is always the slave drive on the first IDE channel (with /dev/hda present)
[04:55] <poolkey172> rausb0 : Sorted all the things out include /lib/module volatile
[04:56] <Holmen> somebody here that has any experience from starting a FTP server that shall share an NTFS(-3g) partition?
[04:56] <beryltrouble> Holmen, me not.. sorry
[04:56] <rausb0> poolkey172: i dont have the time to keep reading this channel permanently
[04:56] <monokrome> lol

[04:57] <daniel789> how would you change nv to nvidia, http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3760/screenshot2vr8.png??
[04:57] <tuna-fish-> soundray: not quite that simple, as my hda isn't the master of my first ide channel, courtesy of some bios magic. Still, that was my problem, bios not properly set up.
[04:57] <monokrome> Eeew. XChat
[04:57] <monokrome> :'(
[04:57] <beryltrouble> brianski, xchat...

[04:58] <brianski> lots of votes for xchat
[04:58] <brianski> hm
[04:58] <brianski> i'm surprised there isn't a gnome-specific way
[04:58] <monokrome>

[05:00] <tuna-fish-> in primary hdb and another masked drive
[05:00] <daniel789> hello guys, how do you, change nv to nvidia, i am a newbie,  http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3760/screenshot2vr8.png
[05:00] <soundray> tuna-fish-: okay, weird setup. I was going to suggest you put the DVD on a separate IDE channel to gain some speed.
[05:00] <tuna-fish-> linux probably sees them differently
[05:01] <daniel789> http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3760/screenshot2vr8.png

[05:04] <daniel789> please,help a Nubbie :-) ,  http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3760/screenshot2vr8.png look at that
[05:04] <dcordes> is there a way to install edgy to an existing ext3 fs without neccessarily formatting it?
[05:05] <nomin> when I do "fdisk -l", what does the star mean under the 'boot' section?
[05:05] <jeff2> when I try to update my system using the update notifier in gnome, I get "Only one software management tool is allowed to run at a the same time". I don't have aptitude or synaptic running. where are the lock files I can delete to make it so I can update my system?
[05:05] <soundray> daniel789: run that line that it suggests (beginning with md5sum) with sudo, then retry
[05:05] <jeff2> nomin: bootable
[05:05] <daniel789> ok
[05:05] <nomin> jeff2: does that mean the partitions not marked are not bootable?
[05:05] <soundray> nomin: it only means something for the old DOS MBR boot thingy
[05:06] <daniel789> okay i did that asked for password, put it in Although i did not see, password dots
[05:06] <jeff2> nomin, * means bootable, no star is not bootable
[05:06] <brianski> soundray: that's not true - the prtition with the * gets booted if you have multiple OSs installed
[05:06] <soundray> daniel789: you don't get "password dots" in the terminal.
[05:06] <Healot> i got OSS installed
[05:07] <daniel789> KK
[05:07] <soundray> brianski: exactly, but only if you have an old DOS style MBR.
[05:07] <nomin> "Warning: First sector of /dev/hdb3 doesn't have a valid boot signature"  <-- /deb/hdb3 has a star in "fdisk -l".
[05:07] <Joakim> Hey
[05:07] <daniel789> okay so i put in sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum after closeing terminal
[05:07] <brianski> soundray: what is the new alternative?
[05:07] <jeff2> daniel789, the password isn't echoed because that would reveal its length. its more secure to turn off echo completely
[05:07] <nomin> */dev/hdb3
[05:07] <soundray> brianski: grub, lilo, ...
[05:07] <Joakim> I have tried to install (Frost|Lime)wire
[05:08] <daniel789> now if i type a letter in it does a echo , 2 letters
[05:08] <daniel789> yea..
[05:08] <daniel789> but im a nub.
[05:08] <Joakim> It won't launch
[05:08] <Joakim> I know what it is
[05:08] <Zbyshek> Good afternoon. Do someone have working bluez-utils on edgy? Or do someone tried to install debian packages on ubuntu?
[05:08] <daniel789> so im gonna wait if something happens now.
[05:08] <Joakim> When I try to run it from the terminal
[05:08] <brianski> soundray: ah
[05:08] <Joakim> It prints out an message
[05:09] <Joakim> runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[05:09] <Joakim> So I opened runFrost.sh
[05:09] <soundray> Joakim: edit the first line of runFrost.sh and replace sh with bash
[05:09] <Joakim> Ok, thanks
[05:10] <Joakim> I couldn't find any special in line 44
[05:10] <poolkey172> hmmmm network is still not working sympthoms are that the interface is being brought uo at bought time but just waiting at dhcp
[05:10] <soundray> Joakim: it's because runFrost expects bash, but edgy has dash as a synonym for sh
[05:11] <Wyvern> ...i think I broke apt-get somehow. :(
[05:11] <soundray> Wyvern: what's the symptom?
[05:11] <Wyvern> tried to unsinstall and reinstall cupsys, and now it refuses to reinstall it
[05:11] <daniel789> take it out on the cat then lol
[05:11] <Joakim> I see

[05:12] <Wyvern> sorry, that was just a small part of it tho. :P
[05:13] <Joakim> soundray: It didn't work
[05:13] <Wyvern> anyway, the symptom is that the child exit with status 1. :P
[05:13] <soundray> Wyvern: reboot before you try anything else
[05:13] <Wyvern> did that.
[05:13] <soundray> !doesn't work | Joakim
[05:13] <ubotu> Joakim: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[05:13] <Joakim> lol
[05:14] <Wyvern> funny thing is that if I try to install anything else, that crashes too, after the line "Setting up cupsys .."
[05:14] <Joakim> It still print the same error
[05:14] <rambo3> Joakim, what script  ? paste it maby
[05:14] <Wyvern> thus, i broke apt-get
[05:14] <cherubiel> Wyvern: use -f
[05:14] <Joakim> runFrost.sh
[05:14] <Joakim> 2 sec
[05:14] <Joakim> I'll paste it
[05:14] <cherubiel> Joakim: pastebin it
[05:15] <abufaress> hi
[05:15] <rambo3> Wyvern, no . child exited with status 1 , means sub proccess got errorr , meaning maby unpacking faild , you forgot sudo
[05:15] <eneried> hello, could somebody tell me what file is used to configure the text mode on linux? not xorg.conf, i need to work without any x server...
[05:15] <soundray> Wyvern: find out what the specific error is that causes the setup script to exit with 1. It might be in /var/log/syslog or somewhere in /var/log/cups/
[05:15] <Wyvern> i am root...
[05:15] <benny99> My sounddevice number changes sometimes, so my soundcard isn't hw:0,0 , but hw:2,0 , how can I fix that ?
[05:15] <eneried> just tty, console or chel, whatever you name it
[05:15] <eneried> excuse me, shell
[05:15] <soundray> rambo3: without sudo, (s)he wouldn't even have got this far.
[05:16] <eneried> I need to work from command line only, and I need to set up the fonts, the keyboard layout, and the language
[05:16] <abufaress>

[05:26] <poolkey172> rausb0 : webben : Still having problem with interface not coming up at boot /etciftab mod has fixed the interface name but its still not coming up cleanley
[05:26] <zenwhen> wow
[05:26] <soundray> abufaress: what do you want?
[05:26] <defrysk> jerre21, sounds like a bad burned disk
[05:27] <poolkey172> abufaress : how can I help ?
[05:27] <rausb0> poolkey172: is the only interface still named eth2?
[05:27] <webben> poolkey172, can you define "not coming up cleanley"?
[05:27] <jerre21> defrysk: i burned it 2 times, i tought also that it was bad burned
[05:27] <poolkey172> webben : it hangs doing dhcp
[05:27] <daniel789> yer, make sure you put it on a lower burn speed if thats the case,
[05:27] <webben> poolkey172, and what sort of network are we talking about?
[05:27] <jerre21> defrysk but it stays
[05:27] <poolkey172> webben : eth
[05:27] <defrysk> jerre21, tried burning it al a low speed ?
[05:27] <daniel789> yea lowest, that i did,
[05:27] <jerre21> defrysk: at 4x
[05:27] <webben> poolkey172, have you tried setting it to auto in /etc/network/interfaces?
[05:27] <defrysk> hmmm
[05:27] <poolkey172> rausb0 : no its eth0 now
[05:27] <daniel789> yes 4x,
[05:28] <daniel789> 600kb,
[05:28] <defrysk> jerre21, md5sum matches ?
[05:28] <poolkey172> webben : interfaces is fine : rausb0 checked
[05:28] <jerre21> defrysk: what you mean ^^
[05:28] <rausb0> poolkey172: and you do have a dhcp server on the net the machine is connected to?
[05:28] <defrysk> the downloaded iso has an md5sum
[05:28] <edgy> Hi, I installed openoffice.org-l10n-ar package on my ubuntu dapper and on tools -> options I didn't find arabic listed on the user interface option though I found an option "unknown" I tried to choose it but still the GUI is english, is this a bug in oo.o or ubuntu packaging?
[05:28] <dxdemetriou> can I connect 2 pcs with usb2usb cable, and to act as ethernet?
[05:28] <webben> poolkey172, Then I'm out. :( Maybe someone else can think of something obvious to check.
[05:28] <defrysk> jerre21, check the downloadpage for the md5sum of the iso
[05:29] <jerre21> defrysk the name of my iso is ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386
[05:29] <poolkey172> rausb0 : yup dhcp server is fine as after I log in and do ifdown eth0;ifup eth0 it works perfect
[05:29] <defrysk> and also do md5sum <yourimage>
[05:29] <poolkey172> webben : thankyou for you efforts
[05:29] <webben> poolkey172, yw ... they weren't very impressive :(
[05:30] <jerre21> defrysk where do i get the md5sum:-s
[05:30] <defrysk> jerre21, md5sum makes a calcultion of your iso witch should match the md5sum given on the downloadpage
[05:30] <rausb0> poolkey172: maybe the card has problems negotiating the link type (100MBps fullduplex or whatever) what brought up for the first time
[05:30] <defrysk> jerre21, you are on windows ?
[05:30] <jerre21> defrysk yes
[05:30] <poolkey172> webben : a response and contribution count in my book
[05:30] <defrysk> google for md5sum.exe jerre21
[05:31] <jerre21> defrysk ow its a file in my windows?
[05:31] <poolkey172> rausb0 : nope its not that u sort that the auto neg worked viathe kernel before the inface was brought up
[05:31] <defrysk> no its an app
[05:31] <defrysk> jerre21, you need to download it
[05:31] <poolkey172> must be something else
[05:32] <jerre21> defrysk: i can see only the files for windows 89 or milenium
[05:32] <defrysk> jerre21, google for md5sum.exe
[05:32] <rausb0> poolkey172: hmm, for how long does it hang during dhcp?
[05:32] <Joakim> ok
[05:32] <defrysk> jerre21, in other words find it and download it and then use it
[05:32] <Joakim> Now I have launched FrostWire
[05:32] <Joakim> But...
[05:32] <jerre21> defrysk: Windows 95/98/Me
[05:33] <poolkey172> rausb0 : on boot its infinate
[05:33] <Joakim> When I run the program now, the main windows is blank
[05:33] <jerre21> defrysk: its only available for those windows, i have xp
[05:33] <poolkey172> until I hit ifdown/ifup
[05:33] <brianski> what's the best flash player for linux (without regard for Free-ness) ?
[05:34] <rausb0> poolkey172: can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces once again?
[05:34] <defrysk> jerre21, its likely it also works on xp

[05:37] <poolkey172> rausb0 : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34569/
[05:37] <soundray> brianski: now that Sun is GPL'ing Java, there isn't even a political reason anymore not to use it.
[05:37] <brianski> soundray: things are complicated in *bsd with java because usually there are binary only ports to linux, and so if you want the native version, you have to do hideous things like install linux emulation and build the linux version, then build a native version from that (which is buggier)
[05:38] <brianski> soundray: right
[05:38] <brianski> they're only 5 years too late :(

[05:53] <rrittenhouse> I just installed edgy and when doing the partitioning step I forgot to tell it I wanted to format the existing partition (dapper install). So I went back and told it to and then the installer went straight into installing the system. I have an ubuntu edgy system with no users now? Could I somehow just add a user or change the root password or something? Any help would be appreciated.. Thanks

[06:11] <poolkey172> froid : when u bought ure monitor and powered it on for the first time was it a little lighter in the center ?
[06:11] <poolkey172> froid : ok
[06:11] <cappiz> someone here using horde??
[06:11] <ramvi> Is there an open source indesign alternative?
[06:11] <froid> poolkey172,  hat was that u asked me to paste ?
[06:11] <cappiz> and knows some advanced config options for timezone?
[06:11] <mlehrer> cappiz: yes i have a troll mage
[06:11] <Renan_s2> ramvi, take a look at Scribus
[06:11] <Rprp> Hmm.. i just installed limewire.. but still its not starting :/
[06:11] <poolkey172> froid : xdpyinfo
[06:12] <cappiz> mlehrer do you know how i can make horde show the users prefs timezone? and not the servertime? for the "Last login" info
[06:12] <dcordes> how can i get k3b to copy my encrypted dvd movie?
[06:12] <ramvi> Renan_s2, thanks
[06:12] <mlehrer> cappiz: i was making a joke, sorry, i don't really use horde
[06:12] <soundray> hc`: those are just warnings. The real problem is that it finds no screens. Maybe if you run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg', you can set the proper resolutions for your setup. Also, look at the troubleshooting section in the Ubuntu guide on NVidia drivers...
[06:12] <soundray> !nvidia | hc`
[06:12] <ubotu> hc`: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:12] <Halpo> where are standard header files located such as math.h?
[06:12] <cappiz> bah :P
[06:13] <cafree> Can anyone recommend a console-based irc client for ubuntu?
[06:13] <hc`> soundray: been there, done that.
[06:13] <froid> poolkey172,  here it is: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34578/
[06:13] <hc`> cafree: irssi
[06:13] <hc`> !irssi | cafree
[06:13] <ubotu> cafree: irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )
[06:13] <cappiz> bitchx cafree
[06:13] <soundray> Halpo: find out with 'locate math.h' (/usr/include over here)
[06:13] <cafree> ok, thanks, I'll try irssi
[06:14] <soundray> hc`: is your card definitely supported?
[06:14] <Rprp> Hmm.. i just installed limewire.. but still its not starting :/
[06:14] <KSP> can someone tell me why my ralink wifi card shows up as wlan0 under 6.10, but ra0 under 6.06?
[06:14] <flip> hi all -- is there a differnace ubuntu ppc channel?
[06:14] <jbroome> no
[06:14] <poolkey172> froid : the only difference between ures and mine is the my monitor is called 'Generic Monitor' instead of assus : and also my section "monitor" has refresh rates
[06:14] <strabes> Rprp: I had the same problem; try frostwire
[06:14] <soundray> KSP: because the driver has changed
[06:14] <Rprp> Frostfire?
[06:14] <hc`> soundray: yeah, i think so.
[06:15] <cbx33> I know this is an ubuntu channel, but anyone got access to IE7?
[06:15] <froid> poolkey172,  on windows it did the same, and after installing the intel driver, it worked fine on 1440x900
[06:15] <Rprp> Where can i download it?
[06:15] <cbx33> oh nevermin
[06:15] <poolkey172> froid : Hmmmmm mine worked out of the box
[06:15] <froid> but there is no linux driver for the intel video card on the motherboard cd
[06:15] <jbroome> !frostwire
[06:15] <ubotu> frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[06:15] <KSP> soundray, but where can I get documentation on this new driver? the configuration that worked for ra0 doesn't work for wlan0
[06:16] <poolkey172> froid : posting u my xorg.conf
[06:17] <Exclamation> brb,
[06:17] <poolkey172> froid : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34579/
[06:17] <froid> poolkey172, if i were to understand the xorg.conf, i'd say it recognized both my video card and monitor... right ?
[06:17] <poolkey172> froid yuo
[06:17] <poolkey172> froid yup
[06:18] <jo_> salut, y a t'il un fr?

[06:18] <nomin> daniel789: I do.
[06:18] <daniel789> ,,i have to change nv to nvidia
[06:18] <nomin> daniel789: I nvidia
[06:18] <soundray> KSP: how does it fail?
[06:18] <daniel789> i have no clue because , i am a newbie
[06:19] <nomin> *I have nvidia
[06:19] <jo_> je suis sous linux et en wifi, le souci , c'est que linux fait passer mon port ethernet en 1er et ignore mon port wifi, je suis donc obliger  chaque dmarrage de faire une "ifdown eth0" suivi d'un "ifdown wlan0" pour finir par un "ifup wlan0", ce que j'essaiede faire, c'est de creer un bouton qui me lancerait cette suite de commande, je ne veux pas la lancer autom atiquement au demarrage car le jour ou je desire me co en ethernet, je devrai faire la manip inver
[06:19] <jo_> se... voila, merci a tous ceux qui pourraient m'aidez ;), ( je suis pour info sur kubuntu edgy eft 6.10 )
[06:19] <Rprp> Can someone help me? LImewire/Frostfire isnt starting here:(

[06:20] <poolkey172> froid yup
[06:20] <soundray> Rprp: 'cd /bin ; sudo ln -sf bash sh' then try again
[06:20] <KSP> soundray, it appears that quit a bit of the syntax of the stanza that I used for ra0 doesn't work for wlan0 (I did change the references of ra0 to wlan0)
[06:20] <Rprp> oke
[06:20] <froid> ok, it doesn't seem to work for me :P
[06:20] <soundray> hc`: sorry, I'm out of ideas for your prob
[06:21] <bunny> Hey could anyone give me a quick overview on how to update nvidia drivers? i'd be most grateful
[06:21] <nomin> daniel789: Once you get the hang of installing nvidia you'll be pretty quick at it next time around.  It's pretty much step-by-step instructions unless you want to do things like tv-out which is what I have.
[06:21] <Rprp> Well,, nothing :(
[06:21] <froid> poolkey172,  many thanks anyway for helping

[06:21] <poolkey172> froid however I did use dplg-reconfigure xorg
[06:21] <hc`> soundray: i think i found the solution. When i run # dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[06:22] <froid> poolkey172,  what's that ? remember it's my first linux
[06:22] <soundray> KSP: maybe the way forward is to download the driver from Ralink Technologies.
[06:22] <defrysk> !upgrade | Chaosphilipp
[06:22] <ubotu> Chaosphilipp: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

[06:30] <poolkey172> In xessionlog i get "open: Permission denied" (open being the vt) why would this happen ?
[06:31] <poolkey172> do I need to create .Xauthority ?
[06:31] <defrysk> poolkey172, more like delete it
[06:32] <Surghi> what negative consequences do I have to expect when I enable my root account by doing  "sudo passwd" for giving my  root  a password?
[06:32] <srikanthssn> what could be the problem in my SCIM, when i start it says   Loading x11 FrontEnd module ...
[06:32] <srikanthssn> Failed to launch SCIM.
[06:32] <poolkey172> defrysk : done that : open is the problem :o
[06:33] <defrysk> poolkey172, what is your prob and how did you manage to get into that prob ?
[06:33] <NoUse> Surghi its less secure, is there a reason you want to?
[06:34] <poolkey172> defrysk : the filesystem was moved from one machine to another : and I have just been ironing out the little buys here and there
[06:34] <Surghi> NoUse, why is it less secure?  I cannot see any reason why the way it is currently solved should be better
[06:34] <defrysk> poolkey172, oooh thats beyond my capabilities unfortunately
[06:34] <NoUse> !sudo | Surghi
[06:34] <ubotu> Surghi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:34] <poolkey172> defrysk : No worries mate
[06:35] <Surghi> NoUse, if I get hacked on my user account, everybody can do the same
[06:35] <rambo3> root aint there more unsecure most users here have same username as on their system .
[06:35] <NoUse> Surghi a cracker has to guess two pieces of information to gain access to your system, user and password, if root is enabled they already have half of what they need
[06:38] <poolkey172> anyone know if I can do a dpkg-reconfigure networking ?
[06:38] <PaSurf> I am having problems with my system not wanting to load programs and not wanting to exit (reboot or shut down) the system in the etch GUI.  This has happened before but not sure why or what to do about it.  The system hardware is less than a year old and I have no other issues...
[06:38] <Surghi> NoUse, okay but you forget that the "root" user exists anyhow.... just the root password is unknown for me .... a hacker can also try to hack root because root exists
[06:38] <misiek> i need help with a radeon driver issue: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34582/
[06:39] <Eystein> hi
[06:39] <NoUse> Surghi no root is disabled by default, they can't guess the password because it doesnt' exist
[06:39] <LjL> Surghi, the root password is not "unknown to you" - there is simply no valid root password
[06:40] <Surghi> LjL, I heard that the installation tool applies a random value to the root account
[06:40] <LjL> Surghi: that's wrong.
[06:40] <LjL> Surghi: "sudo cat /etc/shadow" will show you there is no random value, but just a one-character value that can't be matched by any password
[06:40] <rambo3> from the tails of fedora users?
[06:41] <romulus__> salut
[06:41] <Surghi> root has a value LjL
[06:41] <MattCa> How does one rollback from a security update?
[06:42] <Surghi> Does the alternate CD give me a faster / better installed system as the live CD ?  Want to upgrade to Edgy Elt today
[06:42] <LjL> Surghi: yes, it has value "!". which is no valid password. if it has a different value for you, then i guess you aren't using Dapper or Edgy (or even Breezy), or didn't install using the standard means
[06:43] <rmbl> Surghi: it just provides a text installer .
[06:43] <i7ch> what's a quick command to determine the size (in human-readable format) of an HD? df -h just shows partitions
[06:43] <rmbl> and is meant for computers with less than 196 MBs Ram
[06:43] <Surghi> rmbl, any difference in the installed system later`
[06:43] <Surghi> ?

[07:34] <JorgeXT> but I don't know where to unpack it
[07:34] <kmaynard> JorgeXT, unpack it in /opt
[07:35] <kmaynard> then run /opt/firefox/firefox  you can also edit your menus to link the launcher to the new FF
[07:35] <JorgeXT> ahh
[07:35] <JorgeXT> opt is the folder for programs?
[07:35] <kmaynard> JorgeXT, you could put it in /var if you wanted too...i just use /opt for stuff i add myself

[07:36] <JorgeXT> kmaynard: Thanks
[07:36] <kmaynard> derekS, for authentication, you'll probably wanna use samba...nfs is pretty weak, AFAIK
[07:37] <kmaynard> JorgeXT, np.
[07:37] <Agrajag> nfs is incredibly weak
[07:37] <kris14> Jak tam zyjecie??
[07:37] <derekS> kmaynard: hmm, ok, are there any more efficient ones?
[07:37] <kmaynard> derekS, if security isnt a problem, sure, try nfs. otherwise, you can still use samba with linux-only boxes
[07:37] <derekS> kmaynard: ok, i will keep to samba/cifs... i need security
[07:38] <kmaynard> i use nfs at home for my music and photo shares

[07:56] <dcordes> Jinkguns: how can i helf?
[07:56] <poolkey172> jinkguns : use cifs sudo mount -t cifs -o username=Administrator,ro //10.0.0.240/c$ /mnt/f1/
[07:56] <s0nix> poolkey172, im still searching a way to use my promise RAID 0 and that, for ubuntu and windows
[07:56] <friedtofu> so... no one knows the solution to my problem? bleh
[07:56] <dcordes> ah i know what you ned
[07:57] <dcordes> try sshfs!
[07:57] <poolkey172> s0nix its gonna be tricky
[07:57] <dcordes> Jinkguns: sshfs worked great for me
[07:57] <Jinkguns> well
[07:57] <s0nix> :(
[07:57] <Jinkguns> I'm using fstab.
[07:57] <AnthonyG> friedtofu: Be patient :)
[07:57] <Jinkguns> this is my current line
[07:57] <poolkey172> s0nix load up the livecd : install dmraid : and see if you can see your RAID in /dev/mapper/*
[07:58] <dcordes> Jinkguns: never tried it with fstab
[07:58] <poolkey172> s0nix Thats the easy bit : installing ubuntu on it is a bit more tricky ;)
[07:58] <livingtm> dmraid is broken in edgy isnt it?
[07:58] <Jinkguns> /samba.egr.msu.edu/web  /media/web  smbfs  username=bfortino,password=[censored] ,dmask=777,fmask=777  0  0
[07:58] <AnthonyG> dmraid is in the cdrom repository o_O
[07:58] <livingtm> i had to use the alternate install cd to get dmraid working
[07:58] <poolkey172> livingtm : It worked for SIL chipset but it didnt work for VIA
[07:58] <yemu> ArrenLex: here it is: http://paste.uni.cc/11702 but unfortunately it's in polish
[07:58] <s0nix> also... i got another problem.... when i try to boot the liveCD.... i got a black screen
[07:58] <AnthonyG> s0nix: Are you able to type in it?
[07:59] <s0nix> nop nothing at all
[07:59] <ArrenLex> yemu: your plugins are conflicting.
[07:59] <Jinkguns> I think the samba server also requires that I specify a workgroup or domain, which is EGR, but I don't know how to specify that using the fstab.
[07:59] <livingtm> poolkey172, er, i had to use the alternate install to use software raid instaid of fakeraid
[07:59] <AnthonyG> s0nix: Is this a fresh CD?
[07:59] <artmann> thx!
[07:59] <yemu> ArrenLex: what should i do to fix it?
[07:59] <livingtm> poolkey172, i have an nvidia fakeraid
[07:59] <poolkey172> jinkguns : try it off the comand line first
[07:59] <ArrenLex> yemuL apt-get remove totem-mozilla
[07:59] <s0nix> yes, the 6.10 amd64
[07:59] <ArrenLex> :
[07:59] <AnthonyG> s0nix: Hot off the burning tray?
[07:59] <s0nix> and the md5sum are ok
[07:59] <poolkey172> livingtm : cool
[07:59] <poolkey172> livingtm : How did u install on it ;)
[08:00] <AnthonyG> s0nix: That doesn't mean it wrote correctly.
[08:00] <livingtm> poolkey172, i didnt, i used software raid
[08:00] <s0nix> i already has this problem in past......... but i really don't remember what i have do for fix this :|
[08:00] <poolkey172> livingtm : Ah ic
[08:00] <livingtm> poolkey172, dmraid didnt pick up in it, saw it as two disks
[08:00] <AnthonyG> s0nix: I burn mine @ 4x speed , Burning anything too fast risks corruption.
[08:00] <yemu> ArrenLex:  when I try it, I get information that ubuntu-desktop will get removed
[08:00] <yemu> i don't think it's good
[08:00] <AnthonyG> Especially an OS
[08:01] <ArrenLex> yemu: that's fine. It's just a metapackage.
[08:01] <VigoFusion> 1x here,,,,but I am never in a hurry
[08:01] <AnthonyG> And I'm a hypocrite speaking about breaking things.
[08:01] <elias_> is anybody fit with ACL?
[08:01] <Hankers> is there a way to move the Grub to another HD or do you need to run through another install to select a different HD
[08:01] <ArrenLex> yemu: if you don't, you're going to have to install totem properly instead and use that to play media.
[08:01] <s0nix> emm
[08:01] <AnthonyG> I broke Ubuntu yesterday XD
[08:01] <livingtm> is it possible to fix a corrupted vmware image?
[08:01] <Jinkguns> poolkey172:  I got mount error 13 = Permission denied when I tried it your way
[08:01] <poolkey172> livingtm : ic : I was in a pickle as my primary RAID already had windows on it and was unreadable from dmraid so I bought a second cheap fake RAID :)
[08:01] <Enquest> is there here somebody I can call to test ekiga?
[08:01] <psusi> Hankers: open a terminal and man grub
[08:01] <yemu> ArrenLex: and i also get information about many other packages not needed anymore
[08:01] <AnthonyG> s0nix: I believe it's corrupted.
[08:01] <psusi> Hankers: you can install grub yourself
[08:01] <Jinkguns> poolkey172: I think the server wants me to specify a workgroup or domain (its EGR)
[08:02] <livingtm> poolkey172, i saw a real hardware raid card for 150 3ware.com
[08:02] <ArrenLex> yemu: pastebin it, please.
[08:02] <Jinkguns> poolkey172: but I don't know how to do that
[08:02] <sonja-ny> my desktops. i made them 4, but i cant rename them or have diff backgrounds..its a fresh install , no winsucks etc ... when i try to Alter them i get only the options to make more desktops... ?? any ideas ? ..oh yes and loving ubuntu thank you all for your hard work
[08:02] <psusi> poolkey172: did you try the updated dmraid package attached to the bug report?  the one shipped with edgy is known bad
[08:02] <poolkey172> livingtm : 150 dollars ?
[08:02] <livingtm> poolkey172, yes
[08:02] <livingtm> poolkey172, for a 2 x SATA300
[08:02] <Hankers> I have Grub on the same HD as Ubuntu but wish to have it on the "other" OS disk
[08:02] <ajopaul_> has anybody tried kde4 on edgy
[08:02] <rewtaxs> My ethernet is not working. I put in ubuntu live cd and was planning on installing but I didn't have any internet. SO now I'm back in windows. I tried dhclient and nothing. eth0 says connected but I have no IP?
[08:02] <xarq> what do I change in /etc to allow me to see the boot information like the good 'ol days?
[08:03] <livingtm> poolkey172, i didnt buy it, but i was looking into it
[08:03] <rewtaxs> Well it says enabled to be more specific.
[08:03] <poolkey172> psusi : I tried to install the test dmraid but I didn't know howto ! do u know how ?
[08:03] <psusi> Hankers: why?
[08:03] <rewtaxs> It's an emachine w3107
[08:03] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs:  try to unplug your modem for 5 , and refresh it .. worked for me
[08:03] <Hankers> that's the normal boot disk
[08:03] <Jinkguns> AHA
[08:03] <psusi> poolkey172: download the package and run dpkg -i foo.deb
[08:03] <Jinkguns> AWESOME. :D
[08:03] <Agrajag> xarq: you mean instead of the bootsplash? That's set up waaaaay before the kernel knows there's a filesystem with an /etc in it
[08:03] <rewtaxs> sonja, I did everything.
[08:03] <yemu> ArrenLex: I did it, the system didn't explode ;-) here's pastebin: http://paste.uni.cc/11703
[08:03] <rewtaxs> When I boot windows, it works.
[08:03] <psusi> poolkey172: make that sudo dpkg -i foo.deb
[08:04] <yemu> in polish again
[08:04] <rewtaxs> When I boot live cd of nix, it's broke?
[08:04] <Jinkguns> poolkey172:  It just needed a domain=egr, before the username and password entries
[08:04] <Jinkguns> :D
[08:04] <poolkey172> livingtm : 150 dollars  is not that bad you'r lookking at  150 uk pounds here
[08:04] <xarq> Agrajag: go on
[08:04] <Agrajag> xarq: add nosplash to your kernel command line
[08:04] <Imrahil> How well would one expect  a core 2 duo at 2.0Ghz to perform when using 64 bit linux? I have heard +30% for many computationally intensive tasks such as video and sound encoding
[08:04] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs: do you have OTHER pcs on the modem / router ?
[08:04] <Agrajag> xarq: check out /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:04] <ArrenLex> yemu: I don't suppose you could translate line 4 for me?
[08:04] <rewtaxs> sonja, yes.
[08:04] <livingtm> poolkey172, naw, thats USD
[08:04] <rewtaxs> I work at a hosting compnay. We are directly connected to the servers.
[08:04] <Agrajag> xarq: but be careful, if you mess up that file you could hose your bootloader
[08:04] <poolkey172> hmmmm
[08:05] <andreasn> anyone else having problems copying several songs from Banshee to another device, like a phone for example?
[08:05] <sonja-ny> ok rewtaxs unplug them and just let the modem find your IP eth0 etc , it works all the time i tried it with all linux distros
[08:05] <poolkey172> 64bit question anyone ? I'd be interested to know also
[08:05] <soundray> Imrahil: that could be an overestimate or an underestimate, depending on the exact data and algorithm.
[08:05] <yemu> ArrenLex: "Following packets had been installed automatically and are no longer needed"
[08:05] <livingtm> poolkey172, its probably not the best, but they explcitly say "Hardware RAID algorithms"
[08:05] <rewtaxs> sonja I cannot unplug other computers...it's a hosting company.
[08:05] <daniel789> okay guys who game on linux where can i find the latest ece bonus pack for ut 2004,
[08:05] <rewtaxs> we have hundreds of techs connected
[08:06] <sonja-ny> poolkey172:  64 bit fuck it off and use the regular ubuntu, its much faster , and i use an AMD
[08:06] <daniel789> you see its a fricken eww exe, > http://www.unrealtournament.com/ut2004/downloads.html#Addon
[08:06] <ArrenLex> yemu: Ah. Thanks. If you don't need them you should remove them with apt-get autoremove. That message is not related to what I just had you do.
[08:06] <daniel789> gonna look on the forum.
[08:06] <soundray> Imrahil: I experienced a factor 6 speedup on one of my image processing algorithms going from i386 to amd64
[08:06] <ArrenLex> yemu: Sorry, I have to go... good luck
[08:06] <poolkey172> sonja-ny : Much obliged for that informative answer
[08:06] <psusi> soundray: wowsers!
[08:06] <pppoe_dude> hi. any way to enable compositing in metacity on edgy?
[08:07] <yemu> ArrenLex: thanks!
[08:07] <yemu> it helped!
[08:07] <soundray> !language | sonja-ny
[08:07] <ubotu> sonja-ny: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:07] <yemu> thank you very much!
[08:07] <sonja-ny> poolkey172: sorry i can only speek from my experiance, ex debian ex suse ex whatever user, ubuntu is the dogs bollocks.. it works..have fun SIR
[08:07] <highneko> pppoe_dude: ask #ubuntu-xgl
[08:07] <Imrahil> soundray, are things generally faster, such as web browsing, gimp, openoffice, etc?
[08:07] <poolkey172> soundray : but are there enogh packages to play with on 64bit ?
[08:07] <xarq> Agrajag: don't worry, I hose my bootloader all the time
=== visualstation__ is now known as VisualStation__
[08:08] <ArrenLex> Okay, five more minutes. How are you doing, yemu?
[08:08] <sonja-ny> poolkey172: just alone the KDE Ktorrent freezes your pc .. duhhhh but the gnome works just wicked
[08:08] <soundray> poolkey172: I have FP9, acroread, skype and firefox32 running with the 32bit libraries. There isn't much else I need now.
[08:08] <ArrenLex> soundray: why acroread? Run evince instead.
[08:08] <poolkey172> ic soundray : so u're currently on 64bit ?
[08:09] <rewtaxs> so what do i do?
[08:09] <soundray> ArrenLex: I find that it renders some of my LaTeX output far too slowly.
[08:09] <soundray> poolkey172: indeed
[08:09] <mordof> alright.. so i just installed apache/php/mysql from the repos, and i have no idea where my httpd.conf is, haha.. can anyone help me out?
[08:09] <ArrenLex> You know what you doing.
[08:09] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs:  If you ask me , get the basic ubuntu not the amd 64 bit and it all WORKS and fast
[08:09] <VigoFusion> This new install method is telling me to disable fglrx, I can do that, I think, but if the install works, using Xorg,  do I then re-enable fglrx? or just run with it? (its the ATI Xseries 200 Driver)
[08:09] <cablesm102> I'm having a problem with Network Manager. Whenever I log onto IRC, either through Gaim or ChatZilla, it drops the network then reconnects a few  seconds later.
[08:10] <rewtaxs> sonja, it is the basic ubuntu
[08:10] <cablesm102> Anyone else notice this?
[08:10] <xarq> mordof: try updatedb and then locate
[08:10] <rewtaxs> version 6.06 LTS for your PC
[08:10] <poolkey172> soundray : cool : I personally didnt want to risk it : 32bit is still fast and has a lot of packages so no headaches
[08:10] <soundray> rewtaxs: stick with i386 unless you have unusual numbercrunching requirements.
[08:10] <sonja-ny> cablesm102:  your setup is ? or do we need to guess it ?
[08:10] <rewtaxs> Not amd version
[08:10] <Imrahil> poolkey172,  there are most of the packages in launchpad are for 64bit as well
[08:10] <AnthonyG> exit
[08:10] <rewtaxs> grr im not plannign on switching
[08:10] <AnthonyG> Bah , I need to stop doing that XD
[08:10] <rewtaxs> i want my ethernet to work in ti
[08:10] <poolkey172> well dont tempt me ....
[08:10] <rewtaxs> *it
[08:11] <livingtm> my vmware image just locked up so bad ihad to power down reboot- corrupted the hell ou tof the Vm
[08:11] <soundray> poolkey172: my wife has a Turion laptop -- it's got i386 because it's not that much of a image processing machine anyway and I find that it does avoid a lot of hassle.
[08:11] <Sonderblade> when upgrading to edgy, update-manager said something like "/usr/X11R6/bin not empty, failing" does that mean it won't install xorg for me?
[08:11] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs:  take out al your other pcs and leave them running they will find the isp again , reboot your NOW ubuntu and turn OFF the modem , it WILL assign the IP
[08:12] <mordof> xarq: ty
[08:12] <xarq> soundray: I find that a speedy hard drive and lots of RAM do better for image processing than 64-bit arch
[08:12] <rewtaxs> sonja. there are close to 400 computers connected. I work at a web hosting company
[08:12] <rewtaxs> I cannot disconnect every computer how many times do i have to tell you this?
[08:12] <livingtm> anyone had anyluck using firewire as a network adapter?
[08:12] <Jinkguns> How can I automatically run sudo mount -t cifs -o domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=[censored] ,ro //samba.egr.msu.edu/web /media/web during bootup?
[08:12] <ajopaul_> Sonderblade, incase x doesnt startup after a reboot do sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
[08:13] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs: wow so sorry............ let me try it on my system there is only 5 pcs on it
[08:13] <rewtaxs> ok
[08:13] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs: can you download from what you got now .. try a LIVE CD ???
[08:13] <rewtaxs> it is a live cd
[08:13] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs: then do the install ?
[08:13] <livingtm> Jinkguns, have you tried putting it in fstab?
[08:13] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: arrange it into filesystem directory type options 0 0 format and put it into /etc/fstab
[08:14] <rewtaxs> without internet?
[08:14] <haxality> hello
[08:14] <haxality> I was wondering how I would suspend/hibernate my computer from the terminal
[08:14] <rewtaxs> and if it doesnt work after install?
[08:14] <soundray> xarq: if by "image processing" you mean image editing, that may be true. In my work, however, I determine high-dimensional warpings between pairs of 10MB 3D volumes to maximise similarity. That's very IO intensive and benefits massively from the broader memory bus.
[08:14] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: //samba.egr.msu.edu/web /media/web cifs domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=[censored] ,ro 0 0
[08:14] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs:  you have internet .. the live CD will fix it
[08:14] <rewtaxs> then im stuck without internet, which is a big problem here.
[08:14] <Jinkguns> hmm
[08:14] <haxality> I know they both work normally, I just don't know the command to do it
[08:14] <rewtaxs> no, the ubuntu isnt installed
[08:14] <rewtaxs> i just stuck in live cd and ethernet wasnt working
[08:14] <sonja-ny> rewtaxs:  i meen download the live cd .....
[08:15] <xarq> rewtaxs: what network card do you have?
[08:15] <kdawg> anyone have any recommendations for usb wireless cards?
[08:15] <rewtaxs> i have the live cd?
[08:15] <Sonderblade> upgrade broke and now update-manager says "program index broken run sudo apt-get install -f", is that really what i should do?
[08:15] <mordof> lol, it would be so much easier for windows people if they made the config the same, haha
[08:15] <rewtaxs> It's an emachine w3107 thats all i know
[08:15] <rewtaxs> im not in ubuntu to check it specifically
[08:15] <ArrenLex> Sonderblade: yes.
[08:15] <soundray> xarq: most of these processes never go over the 300MB mark in RAM use, so I can upgrade my RAM all I like and it won't be faster.
[08:15] <sonja-ny> config windows = trash bin looks good for it
[08:15] <Jinkguns> ArrenLex: How do I add rw pe... nevermind. :/
[08:15] <Jinkguns> replace ro with rw, right?
[08:16] <Jinkguns> XD
[08:16] <ArrenLex> Yes.
[08:16] <soundray> Sonderblade: yes
[08:16] <Sonderblade> thanks
[08:16] <xarq> soundray: you can tell your image editor to use more RAM if it's a good image editor *cough* GIMP
[08:16] <soundray> xarq: like I say, I'm not image *editing*
[08:17] <pppoe_dude> can anyone point me to a good guide about installing from apt-get source?
[08:18] <pppoe_dude> i'm getting: sh: dpkg-source: not found / Unpack command 'dpkg-source -x metacity_2.16.3-0ubuntu2.dsc' failed.
[08:18] <sonja-ny> pppoe_dude:  apt-get is kinda OLD we have newer updaterz
[08:18] <xarq> soundray: hmm... now I wonder why you're not using the graphics card to do the computations
[08:19] <pppoe_dude> sonja-ny, ?
[08:19] <daniel789> arrr i can not find where unreal tournament 2004 was installed but it was by default
[08:19] <daniel789> where would stuff go normally in unbuntu dapper drake??
[08:19] <xarq> daniel789: maybe in your home dir?
[08:19] <daniel789> ill check
[08:19] <soundray> xarq: the guy who writes the software is looking into that. I'm just the one who tries to obtain practically useful results with the programs.
[08:20] <x-faktor> what version of ubuntu is more stable, dapper or edgy?
[08:20] <mordof> apt-get is old?
[08:20] <daniel789> because i have to install this patch like drag and replace
[08:20] <xarq> daniel789: "normal" stuff goes in /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, etc.
[08:20] <Subhuman> x-faktor, dapper.
[08:20] <britt> x-faktor: i think both are pretty stable
[08:20] <daniel789> kk
[08:20] <Subhuman> and dapper has long term support.
[08:20] <mordof> what would i use instead of apt-get?
[08:20] <britt> dapper has more support
[08:20] <sonja-ny> mordof: yes
[08:20] <Subhuman> britt, nah edgy is nowhere near as stable as dapper.
[08:20] <x-faktor> ok, because i got a freeze at boot just after installer edgy
[08:21] <soundray> !bootoptions | x-faktor
[08:21] <ubotu> x-faktor: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
[08:21] <mordof> x-faktor: i'm on dapper - it works great, heh
[08:21] <Crescendo> VNCviewer returns ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::SystemException: read: Connection reset by peer (104) when trying to connect to the server - how do I resolve this?
[08:21] <x-faktor> maybe i'll reinstall dapper
[08:21] <sonja-ny> x-faktor: amd 64 bit ?
[08:21] <britt> s
[08:21] <xarq> x-faktor: you might as well try dapper then and see if you don't freeze
[08:21] <elite_hacker> i am using gnome, and i don't like how when i click on a window it automatically comes to the top.  in my old window manager you had to click on the top of the window to make it come to the top.  i don't see any way to make gnome behave the way i want.  can kde do it?
[08:21] <x-faktor> no 32 bits, but in vmware
[08:21] <abo> britt, since I upgraded to edgy I'm having all kind of problems... I wish i never did it...
[08:21] <britt> Subhuman: of course, i needed to include the obligatory YMMV
[08:21] <x-faktor> but now i rebooted and it seems OK
[08:21] <mordof> elite_hacker: why not install your other window manager?
[08:21] <xarq> x-faktor: or you could turn on the boot info and see what it freezes on
[08:21] <[Kork] ^nobo> hi guys
[08:22] <sigger> when I start vsftpd, where is it looking for files to serve.  I'd have thought /var/ftp but there is none.
[08:22] <[Kork] ^nobo> i'm desperate
[08:22] <x-faktor> just once freeze for the moment
[08:22] <poolkey172> Guys is there a way to dpkg-reconfigure sound ?
[08:22] <elite_hacker> mordof: cause then I don't have all those ubuntu options at the top, and my audio volume keys don't work
[08:22] <[Kork] ^nobo> i build in a new sata harddrive and some RAM
[08:22] <mordof> elite_hacker: ah i see
[08:22] <x-faktor> xarq> btw what's the command to see boot log ?
[08:23] <[Kork] ^nobo> now gnome freezes on login
[08:23] <mordof> elite_hacker: might have to find a window manager that does both? i dunno.. i'm kinda new, heh
[08:23] <britt> x-faktor: seems to be perfectly fine for me, ive been running it for a while now, and only had issues trying to conifg the new init prog called upstart
[08:23] <misiu_mp> I have no video overlay on radeon OS drivers: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34582/
[08:23] <misiu_mp> help please
[08:23] <xarq> x-faktor: you add nosplash to your /boot/grub/menu.lst kernel options
[08:23] <x-faktor> ok britt
[08:23] <[Kork] ^nobo> entering gnome-session on commandline returns: Gtk-Warning **: cannot open display:
[08:23] <[Kork] ^nobo> any ideas?
[08:23] <britt> to allow me to put a terminal on a serial port, other than that, i use mythtv daily. no issues. ymmv
[08:23] <x-faktor> ok thanks  xarq
[08:23] <edd_> ne1 know how to get a wireless card bak
[08:23] <edd_> ?
[08:23] <ski-worklap> this is weird. gnome detects my volume keys and adjusts the displayed volume appropriately, but it has no afect on the actual volume (and sound works)
[08:24] <lumpki> [Kork] ^nobo, did you replace your /home partition?
[08:25] <[Kork] ^nobo> lumpki, i added a new drive. no changes on old one. win xp works allright
[08:25] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: Did you see the new forum posts?
[08:25] <daniel789> garrh, can't see, to find unreal tournament 2004, it was installed with sudo command
[08:25] <[Kork] ^nobo> daniel789, /usr/local/games
[08:26] <daniel789> k
[08:26] <xarq> daniel789: try sudo updatedb; locate unreal
[08:26] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: not recently but i checked before with no result. did you see anything about it there?
[08:26] <daniel789> i found it, thank you for your input
[08:26] <x-faktor> is there a way to replace the shortcut CTRL+C to erase current line in a bash, with something else?
[08:27] <Crescendo> I'd like to know that, too - I want Ctrl+c to be copy. >=] 
[08:27] <xarq> x-faktor: you could configure xmodmap
[08:27] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: Yes, todays lists the fix for most all ATI,nVidea , http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=204910
[08:28] <x-faktor> xarq> it's a tool to remap keyboard keys?
[08:28] <x-faktor> i'll check this out
[08:28] <xarq> yeah, but be careful
[08:28] <Surghi> what is better,  apt-get or aptitude ?
[08:28] <haxality> does anyone know how to suspend/hibernate a computer from the command line
[08:28] <Jinkguns> Great, fstab successfully mounted the samba share, with the domain,username,password information, I can browse most of the shares. But I have no write access. :(
[08:28] <x-faktor> i think there must be a better way , easier i mean
[08:28] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: i use open source drivers, so it doesnt apply
[08:29] <daniel789> i have a problem i do not have permission to write to my root ut 2004 folder,
[08:29] <daniel789> how do i change permissions to change files like you do in windows?
[08:29] <xarq> !permissions
[08:29] <ubotu> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[08:29] <we2by> guys, if u have intel p4 with ht, do I need a smp kernel?
[08:29] <psusi> ctrl-c is the terminal break key, it has nothing to do with copying or clearing text
[08:29] <mordof> alright so i found the apache2.conf, but i'm not sure how to set the default folder (the one it views when i type "localhost")
[08:29] <psusi> it kills whatever is currently running
[08:29] <daniel789> ok ill read that.
[08:29] <Lynoure> Surghi: opinions vary, and some people even use both. You can try both and decide which works better for your needs
[08:29] <psusi> you can change which key is bound to kill on a terminal with the stty command
[08:30] <ski-worklap> we2by, you neither need nor want an smp kernel in that situation
[08:30] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: They are propietary, but they are at least working with Open Source.
[08:30] <Surghi> Lynoure, can you at least give me a tip what the differences are?
[08:30] <ski-worklap> hyperthreading often, if not usually, decreases performance
[08:31] <we2by> ski-worklap: then I won't be able to use the HT feature
[08:31] <Lynoure> Surghi: man apt  and  man aptitude  will be more comprehensive that I could ever be
[08:31] <lumpki> can anyone tell me, is there an #ubuntu-advocacy channel on this thing?
[08:31] <xarq> ski-worklap: do you have a URL for that claim?
[08:31] <ski-worklap> xarq, google it
[08:31] <daniel789> okay , i want read write and execute for the admin , thats me..
[08:31] <mordof> xarq: yeah i've heard the same thing
[08:31] <Surghi> Lynoure: thank you :)
[08:32] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: No i use the open source 'ati' or 'radeon' driver, supported by the community. not the proprietary written by ati
[08:32] <palomer> hello
[08:32] <palomer> how do I install japanese fonts?
[08:32] <ski-worklap> we2by, no you won't be able to use the feature if it's disabled. what i was saying is you probably don't want it - it probably won't increase your performance
[08:32] <ski-worklap> but that claim is very workload dependent
[08:32] <palomer> for mozilla
[08:32] <lumpki> surghi, apt-get is more hands on. aptitude does some automation
[08:33] <ski-worklap> the main problem iirc is that you wind up having your logical processors competing for cpu cache
[08:33] <lumpki> if you like to keep things tidy, use aptitude
[08:33] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: I cannot , or do not have the Linux know how to get mine working, I am stuck with 800x600 reso , its kinda frustrateing. But its a learning experiance, so its fun.
[08:34] <we2by> ski-worklap: I read that with HT, the system is bit more responsive
[08:34] <we2by> making a user feel it is faster
[08:34] <Lynoure> debfoster is also nice for tidiness
[08:34] <Winand> can somebody help me with an unrelated question
[08:34] <ski-worklap> we2by, this might be true. most of stuff i read related to the use of ht in a server environment
[08:34] <Winand> I have to send a mp3 player through the post office, what is the best way of sending it
[08:34] <lumpki> and deborphan
[08:34] <ski-worklap> just know it's not going to be a slam dunk or anything :)
[08:35] <chipman> Hi, can anyone explain why Ubuntu's startup sounds run, but no other sounds work (not even ogg)?
[08:35] <we2by> I know, a but a bit mroe responsive is very nice
[08:35] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: mine is working just fine except for the video overlay. i have an r200 (8500) chip
[08:35] <psusi> Windigo: that's off topic, but I'd say well packaged and insured.
[08:35] <xarq> ski-worklap: from what I'm reading about hyperthreading, that looks like a software problemm, not a problem with the hyperthreading hardware itself
[08:35] <Jowi> Winand, in a package
[08:35] <ArrenLex> chipman: run the command "amixer" and pastebin the text that you get. Give us the link.
[08:35] <ArrenLex> !pastebin
[08:35] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:35] <daniel789> okay this won't be to wise but im thinking of all allow for everybody on this system, heh just gonna use it for gameing.
[08:35] <psusi> xarq: looks like what is a software problem?
[08:35] <ski-worklap> xarq, not really
[08:35] <Winand> Jowi: like a box or something? I don't have anything small enough
[08:35] <ski-worklap> not so much a software problem as a problem that is manifested by certain types of software
[08:36] <xarq> psusi: performance decreases from having hyperthreading enabled
[08:36] <xarq> ski-worklap: yes, certain types of software which are not hyperthreading savvy
[08:36] <ski-worklap> no
[08:36] <xarq> ski-worklap: and could be optimized to not suffer those problems
[08:36] <ski-worklap> it's not an issue of making your program ht "savvy"
[08:36] <Jowi> Winand, buy a padded envelope at the post office. not too expensive and pretty safe packaging all and all.
[08:37] <chipman> amixer output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34618/
[08:37] <xarq> ski-worklap: that's what this article says: http://www.2cpu.com/articles/42_2.html
[08:37] <StAnLeY^> Hello. I installed Ubuntu Edgy some time ago and it worked flawlessly. But after a recent software upgrade, the desktop crashes after entering the password in gdm. The desktop loads fine, then in the next moment the colors get shifted and one is returned to gdm. The virtual terminals (ctr+alt+f1) also become unreadable. Does anyone know a fix for this problem ?
[08:37] <ski-worklap> this is pointless and ot anyway, we2by got what he wanted and this is offtopic :)
[08:37] <psusi> it is more a matter of single threaded programs can't benefit from multiple processors, and enabling multiple processors adds some overhead to coordinate them, and HT isn't as good as two true processors
[08:37] <Winand> o thanks joiw
[08:38] <soundray> StAnLeY^: what's your graphics hardware, and what driver are you using?
[08:38] <jlhenry> Hi
[08:38] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: Would you or may I ask you to assist me in getting my Xpress 200 series to function? This #channel is obviously not the place, but I am linuxly challenged. :-$
[08:38] <Narrchy> can anyone link me to the tutorial on mounting the NTFS drive
[08:38] <StAnLeY^> soundray: Intel GMA 9.., I think I use the stock one
[08:39] <ArrenLex> chipman: what are you using to play sound?
[08:39] <jlhenry>  Does anyone know a tool for mapping network flows. I know nstreams, but I'm searching something more visual
[08:39] <daniel789> okay this CHmod, can it be opened /accessed with the terminal
[08:39] <chipman> ArrenLex: As in software?
[08:39] <ArrenLex> Yes
[08:39] <chipman> I'm using XMMS, or RhythmBox.
[08:39] <lullabud> jlhenry:  etherape?
[08:39] <chipman> I installed the Automatix 2 packages.
[08:39] <ArrenLex> chipman: In XMMS, what audio output are you using?
[08:39] <chipman> But I can't even play an ogg file.
[08:39] <chipman> I'll check.
[08:40] <Doow> !tv-out
[08:40] <ubotu> For help with enabling the TV-Out on certain NVidia cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOutNewbieEdition
[08:40] <iter> I have a samba setup here with no printing, but in syslog I keep getting  smbd:   Unable to open printcap file /etc/printcap for read!
[08:40] <daniel789> well on ubuntu dapper drake im listening to a ogg trance stream with rythmbox
[08:40] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: so you want to run the proprietary drivers? Did you follow the instructions on th ubuntu site?
[08:40] <chipman> How do I see what audio output I'm using?
[08:40] <Lynoure> chipman: ogg support comes as default, so it's likely you have some general sound problem
[08:40] <iter> do I need to add printable = no in smb.conf for the shares?
[08:40] <lamparilla> hello everybody!
[08:40] <ski-worklap> xarq, nowhere in that article does it say that poorly written software is to blame
[08:40] <jlhenry> lullabud, seems to be interesting!
[08:40] <daniel789> yeah the highers and lows on ogg are impressive at such birate
[08:40] <chipman> The sounds for bootup play.
[08:40] <jlhenry> lullabud, thanks
[08:40] <xarq> ski-worklap: I thought you said this conversation was OT
[08:40] <florent_> hi for all !
[08:40] <ski-worklap> and it says exactly what i claimed about the cache thrashing
[08:40] <xarq> ski-worklap: and maybe you should read it more closely
[08:41] <ArrenLex> chipman: right-click on xmms -> options -> prefernces
[08:41] <haxality> does anyone know how to suspend/hibernate a computer from the command line
[08:41] <xarq> ski-worklap: "I would think that the performance gains of hyper-threading will only increase as time goes on and more software is developed in a manner that is advantageous for what it can bring to the table"
[08:41] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: Not yet, I am slow, I looked at them all and bkmarked, but have yet to do any installs as it looks quite complicated.
[08:41] <chipman> Alsa 1.2.10.
[08:41] <xarq> ski-worklap: you're right, you should stop flaming
[08:42] <tartife> slt
[08:42] <DerDracle> Does anyone know how to get Japanese fonts to print through xpdf?
[08:42] <ski-worklap> xarq, that is referring to multi-threading in general, not hyperthreading specific optimizations
[08:42] <DerDracle> I can view them, but, when I print, using a regular printer, or even to a pdf--- the output is garbage.
[08:42] <tartife> hi
[08:42] <Dink> haxality, try sudo hibernate or sudo suspend ??
[08:42] <xarq> ski-worklap: do you even know how to program?
[08:43] <ski-worklap> xarq, hehe no i have no idea.
[08:43] <DerDracle> Oh no... The gauntlet has been thrown...
[08:43] <ski-worklap> my puter runs word tho
[08:43] <Jinkguns> I'm attempting to access the network samba share mounted by fstab (via //samba.egr.msu.edu/web /media/web cifs domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=dtzo7kalai,rw 0 0), unfortunetly, while the share does mount, I only have read only access. No write access.
[08:43] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: This one seems to be the one you should start with: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI. I think you should manage. Just follow the instructions. Its like making a cake.
[08:43] <k0rd> so where's this Jono character?
[08:43] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: Thank you kindly
[08:43] <psusi> xarq: generally speaking, hypethreading isn't going to increase overall computing power because it doesn't really add much more computing hardware...
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: first, paste the output of "ls -dl /media/web"
[08:44] <Sonderblade> update-manager fails to upgrade almost all python-*** packages on my system, does that problem happen everyone?
[08:44] <DevC> finally got ubuntu upgraded to 6.10
[08:44] <mc44> k0rd: "where"?
[08:44] <psusi> what it does do is allow a more responsive desktop because short running interactive tasks can respond with lower latency
[08:44] <Jinkguns> drwxr-xr-x 37 root root 0 2006-07-31 10:50 /media/web
[08:44] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: also, advise you to change that password now :)
[08:45] <Jinkguns> heh, it was an old password. :D
[08:45] <ArrenLex> Okay.
[08:45] <Jinkguns> better then [censored]  I figured
[08:45] <Jinkguns> I think I still use it on a pentium III back home. ;)
[08:45] <Jinkguns> Anyway
[08:45] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: what's your username on that system?
[08:45] <psusi> Jinkguns: you need to specify a umask or uid moun option to allow non root users access
[08:45] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: on your home system?
[08:45] <Jinkguns> Arren. XD
[08:46] <ArrenLex> Yes?
[08:46] <Jinkguns> Leave the P3 alone.
[08:46] <Jinkguns> psusi: how would I add that?
[08:46] <Jinkguns> I assumed rw would do that
[08:46] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: anyway, if you don't want to answer that, mentally replace <u> with your username: "sudo chown <u>:<u> /media/web"
[08:46] <psusi> Jinkguns: by adding it to the option list you just pasted
[08:46] <psusi> Jinkguns: it is mounted read/write... but all the files are owned by root with rw---- permissions
[08:46] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: secondly, add ,umask=000 to the options in that fstab
[08:47] <florent_> I love this command : sudo passwd root
[08:47] <ke> Hey
[08:47] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: if it wont help you could change the /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that in Section "Screen", subsection "Display" all Modes start with your desired resolution
[08:47] <florent_> hey ke
[08:47] <ke> I found this app that looks like Total Commander for Windows
[08:47] <ke> But I can't remember the name of it
[08:48] <d_a_v_e> @ke; what's total commander?
[08:48] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: you should know what im talking about when you open and look at the file
[08:48] <florent_> ke Midnight Commander ?
[08:48] <florent_> ke apt-get install mc ?
[08:48] <ke> Yeah, like mc, but it's not in console
[08:49] <anamnesis> QQQoh shit
[08:49] <anamnesis> i just dissed my friend hard
=== pitfall is now known as gourdin
[08:49] <Jinkguns> bfortino@natsuki:~$ sudo chown bfortino:bfortino /media/web

[08:49] <ubotu> anamnesis: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:49] <psusi> Jinkguns: why are you trying to chown it?
[08:50] <Jinkguns> psusi: he told me too. ;)
[08:50] <anamnesis> lol oopo
[08:50] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: Forget that. Just do the fstab line.
[08:50] <ke> Shit, can't remember the name...
[08:50] <ke> It was like
[08:50] <xarq> Juhaz: write-only?
[08:50] <ke> http://www.mucommander.com/
[08:50] <Jinkguns> okay
[08:50] <mc44> !ohmy | ke
[08:50] <ubotu> ke: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[08:50] <ke> But another one... It had another name
[08:50] <psusi> Jinkguns: no... you were told to add the umask option to the mount parameters
[08:50] <ke> Yeah ok, wasn't supposed to diss anyone, mc44
[08:50] <VigoFusion> misiu_mp: This new page on the forums says that the fix is to not use fglrx, the Binary Pages says use fglrx, hrmm, I will try it again, Thank you.
[08:50] <pibarnas> Hey, I can't download almost anything from sites like 4shared with firefox on edgy amd64. I succeed only using epiphany.
[08:51] <pibarnas> Is there a opera version for edgy amd64?!?
[08:51] <psusi> Jinkguns: linux and windows do not understand each other's permissions systems.... so when you mount an smb share, the kernel just has to make up the file's owner and mode... unless you say otherwise in the mount options, that defaults to root and rwx------
[08:51] <daniel789> you know this sudo stuff, sudo translated meaning admin, to enchance the security,why not use a hardware device to gain access to sudo account??
[08:51] <soundray> pibarnas: I don't know, but I suggest you try firefox32 according to Kilz's instructions on the forums
[08:51] <florent_> mc44 ?
[08:52] <psusi> daniel789: you can if you have such a device
[08:52] <Jinkguns> where do I add the ,umask=000 option?
[08:52] <mc44> florent_: ?
[08:52] <misiu_mp> daniel789: what device do you think of?
[08:52] <psusi> Jinkguns: as I said before, to the mount options you pasted earlier
[08:52] <daniel789> well if a online cracker trys to crack, and has no hardware, then how the heck can he get in.
[08:52] <ke> This can probably do it http://www.nongnu.org/gcmd/

[08:52] <lzhang> Hi guys, can I get some help with a screen resolution prob? I am running an ATI rage fury pro video card and an nec a700+ monitor, 1280x1024 is not displaying properly... I can't get the monitor to stretch all the way horizontally. When I switch to a different resolution, it tries it, and then it switches me back to 1280x1024, asking me to log in again
[08:52] <Jinkguns> oh
[08:52] <Jinkguns> okay
[08:52] <florent_> oh, lol, I think 'mc44', it's a software like Midnight Commander ....
[08:53] <pibarnas> in a weird way, only epiphany works...
[08:53] <psusi> daniel789: by bypassing the requirement for login of course
[08:53] <florent_> not ... it's an human
[08:53] <mc44> florent_: ah :)
[08:53] <daniel789> ive read about these hardware keys, thats it...
[08:53] <florent_> ;-)
[08:53] <florent_> mc44, je pensais que c'tait le nom d'un soft, mdr
[08:53] <psusi> Jinkguns: you put a space between two options, the umask, and the rw
[08:54] <mc44> florent_: je ne compomp pas
[08:54] <Jinkguns> psusi: with , work too?
[08:54] <florent_> mc44 ;-)
[08:54] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: my line should work.
[08:54] <psusi> Jinkguns: yes, each option needs a , between them
[08:54] <daniel789> i have to change permissions to add this ut 2004 patch,
[08:54] <psusi> Jinkguns: not a space
[08:55] <Jinkguns> well
[08:56] <Jinkguns> I tried sudo mount -a and I still don't have access to /media/web (besides read only) it still says its uid is root and is the guid
[08:56] <Minty> hi all
[08:56] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: did you unmount it first?
[08:56] <Jinkguns> no
[08:56] <Cybertrash> Hi together, i have a question regarding ubuntu 6.10 gnome desktop.
[08:56] <Joakim> hey
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: then it's mounted more than once. Run "sudo umount /media/web" repeatedly until it tells you it's not mounted. Then mount -a.
[08:57] <Joakim> How can I run a program with arguments through another program?
[08:57] <ArrenLex> Joakim: you're going to have to be more specific.
[08:57] <Joakim> gnome-terminal -e 'program --arguments' ?
[08:58] <florent_> hum.. I have a question for you ;-) I installed xserver-xgl package on edgy, and my keybord it's not same before.
[08:58] <Jinkguns> ArrenLex: you sure that wasn't supposed to be umask=777?
[08:58] <Joakim> Sorry, my english is not so good. Hard to come up with words
[08:58] <Cybertrash> Is it possible to deactivate the yellow mouse over help boxes?
[08:58] <daniel789> okay what permissions do i change to allow like moveing folders to a nother folder, im newb at this.
[08:58] <daniel789> http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/2301/screenshotbp9.png
[08:58] <Joakim> I tried to be more specific with showing an example
[08:58] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: positive.
[08:59] <Joakim> gnome-terminal -e 'wine something.exe'
[08:59] <florent_> It is not anymore in French. It is in Eglish.
[08:59] <Joakim> Understand?
[08:59] <shwag> is there any linux support for a slingbox ?
[09:00] <Nrrd> daniel789: you running your nautilus session as root?
[09:00] <iter> huh, so I just noticed someone repeatedly reconnecting to my machine via syslog.... I added the IP to /etc/hosts.deny but continuted to see retries
[09:00] <daniel789> erm well this ut 2004 was installed as root / sudo
[09:00] <daniel789> just want to apply these files,
[09:00] <florent_> Joakim, what your real language ?
[09:00] <daniel789> its a patch folder,
[09:00] <iter> do I have to do /etc/init.d/networking restart to effect the changes in /etc/hosts.deny ?
[09:01] <Joakim> Norwegian
[09:01] <florent_> Joakim, arf, I don't speak Norwegian ;-)
[09:01] <Joakim> Hehe
[09:01] <daniel789> basicly change the file by replaceing them ,
[09:02] <daniel789> unless i have to do it command line way, -_-
[09:02] <Nrrd> daniel789: i think you'll still need to install the patches as root/sudo - try running "gksudo nautilus"
[09:02] <Jinkguns> ArrenLex: I've followed your instructions, but /media/web is still read only to normal users. GRRRR.
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: how about "sudo chown -R 777 /media/web"?
[09:03] <ArrenLex> ...
[09:03] <ArrenLex> No, that's silly.
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Let me think.
[09:03] <ArrenLex> Jinkguns: my last suggestion is to add ,defaults to that options line.
[09:03] <xarq> Jinkguns: unmount /media/web and try the command again
[09:04] <bimberi> daniel789: open a terminal, run nautilus session(s) as root by typing 'gksudo nautilus &'
[09:04] <Jinkguns> Ah.
[09:04] <daniel789> yea
[09:04] <daniel789> it said this
[09:04] <xarq> Jinkguns: you can't chown a write-only volume
[09:04] <Jinkguns> Well I just did the quick and dirty sudo nautilus and set all users to write manually
[09:04] <daniel789> (nautilus:10379): GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:
[09:04] <daniel789> Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
[09:04] <Jinkguns> everything works beautifully now
[09:04] <Joakim> gnome-terminal `wine something.exe`
[09:04] <Joakim> I think
[09:05] <Nrrd> daniel789: same happened to me but I still got a nautlilus window to play about with :)
[09:05] <daniel789> well,whatever this did,wonder if i can replace files now,,
[09:05] <alecjw> does anyone know of any graphical (gtk) programs which i can use to download video podcasts with?
[09:06] <Joakim> Ok
[09:06] <Joakim> I'll try to explain clearer
[09:06] <Joakim> I've set up kiba-dock
[09:07] <Jinkguns> For the love of god.
[09:07] <Joakim> And from there I want to run Steam
[09:07] <Jinkguns> ArrenLex: this is what my current fstab line looks like, //samba.egr.msu.edu/web /media/web cifs defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=dtzo7kalai,rw,umask=000 0 0
[09:07] <quotemstr> I'm thinking about switching from SuSE 9.3 to the latest Ubuntu.
[09:07] <ArrenLex> If it works it works.
[09:07] <Joakim> And I think I need to run wine steam.exe through gnome-terminal
[09:07] <Jinkguns> except the password is my real one. :P
[09:07] <Joakim> But how
[09:07] <quotemstr> How difficult in general is it to keep the thing updated?
[09:08] <xarq> Joakim: that actually works?  0_o
[09:08] <Joakim> What?
[09:08] <krazykit> quotemstr: a monkey could keep it up to date.
[09:08] <Jinkguns> quotemstr: very easy
[09:08] <alecjw> quotemstr: you mean ubuntu? it checks for new updates daily and asks you if you wqant to install them
[09:08] <quotemstr> Between major releases too?
[09:08] <xarq> Joakim: steam running on wine?
[09:08] <daniel789> rawr, i can't find ut 2004 where it was ,
[09:08] <Joakim> Yeah, sure
[09:08] <Jinkguns> brb
[09:08] <daniel789> :-D
[09:08] <Joakim> I runs actually quite well!
[09:09] <alecjw> quotemstr: or if you run a commandline system, sudo aptitude upadte && sudo aptitude upgrade
[09:09] <poolkey172> Hi guys .... anyone know how I can probe for my soundcard ?
[09:09] <poolkey172> lspci
[09:09] <Joakim> I play CS without any problems
[09:09] <quotemstr> Right; it's been many years before I've worked with a Debian-based system. Horrible visions of dselect come flooding back...
[09:09] <quotemstr> Thanks.
[09:09] <alecjw> quotemstr: yep, you just need to type in 1 command, but i dunno what it is right now
[09:10] <krazykit> quotemstr: geez, must've been awhile ago.  apt has come a long way
[09:10] <quotemstr> I can tell. :-)
[09:10] <daniel789> i have a question, how do you change permissions on my username (Not root.) to change files please?
[09:10] <alecjw> does anyone know of any good graphical apps to download video podcasts
[09:10] <alecjw> ?
[09:10] <daniel789> i can not seem to find ut 2004 on root but on daniel my one i can
[09:10] <poolkey172> Hmmm that is strange....
[09:10] <MarcN> alecjw: check out democracyplayer
[09:11] <alecjw> MarcN: thanks
[09:11] <WhiteRabt> Anyone know why I have to reset the password for Remote Desktop (VNC) every time I reboot, otherwise it'll give me a authentication failure?
[09:11] <WhiteRabt> its reeeally annoying
[09:11] <Joakim> Did you think that it didn't work?
[09:11] <John64> does anyone know if the kernel compiling process changes in any way due to Upstart?
=== WhiteRabt is now known as WhiteRabit
[09:12] <Vorbote> John64: no.
[09:12] <Jowi> poolkey172, yes. go here and follow the instructions: http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ . You should be able to locate your soundcard and which module it uses. then "sudo modprobe modulename" to enable it
[09:12] <John64> Vorbote:  Thanks!
[09:13] <poolkey172> jowi : I somehow seem to have got it working ? I'm going to check how
[09:13] <daniel789> arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,
[09:14] <Nrrd> daniel789: check yr PMs
[09:14] <poolkey172> jowi : It looks like I am now used OSA
[09:14] <elias_> I know there is an umask entry somewhere in /etc. Can I set a different umasks on a per directory basis?
[09:14] <Jowi> poolkey172, going to check if your soundcard is ok? play a sound to it. "aplay /usr/share/sounds/login.wav"
[09:15] <poolkey172> jowi : I reconfigured to OSD and all seems good
[09:15] <Jowi> ok poolkey172

[09:17] <DevC> by default does ubuntu have gcc installed on it?

[09:17] <Jowi> hmmm. poolkey172 was that what you were asking for?
[09:17] <mc__> DevC: install the package build-essentials
[09:18] <poolkey172> jowi : No I want check keyboard as fluxbox shortcuts are not working properly :(
[09:18] <ski-worklap> hmm
[09:18] <ski-worklap> is it possible to click on links in xchat?
[09:18] <Jowi> poolkey172, no idea. check the fluxbox man pages :)
[09:18] <ski-worklap> they seem to get highlighted, but i can't pull them up in my browser....
[09:18] <mc44> ski-worklap: yes right click
[09:19] <mc44> ski-worklap: when highlighted
[09:19] <mdasilva> that's a secret
[09:19] <GeForce> Hello guys! I have a small problem with ubuntu, but my experience is almost perfect now. My problem is: The Volume applet. I'm trying to make it so that when I roll the volume wheel on my G15 keyboard, it changes volume. but it seems like it's bound to the wrong device. No setting in the sound configs or keyboard configs seem to help. Anyone knows how to change it?
[09:19] <ski-worklap> http://really.com/thanks
[09:19] <ski-worklap> well i'll be. thanks mc44
[09:19] <poolkey172> jowi : fluxbox is configured correctly somehow the keyboard settings itself are not right : I need to fix them through KDE
[09:19] <big> hola alguien de tampico
[09:19] <mc44> ski-worklap: also works for #channelnames
[09:19] <Jowi> poolkey172, i have no idea how to do that or if doing it from KDE will work
[09:20] <poolkey172> jowi : how abot thropugh the shell ?
[09:21] <mc__> the <> | signs do not work on my acer aspire 5620 , how do i enable them? its  germam keyboard. i already tried ""setxkbmap -model pc104 -layout de -variant nodeadkeys"
[09:21] <mordof> is there any remote admin program for linux that will work with RAdmin on windows?
[09:21] <Jowi> poolkey172, a window managers (fluxbox, openbox, pekwm etc) keyboard shortcuts are specific to that window manager. you will probably find better help on the fluxbox homepage or irc channel
[09:21] <kleinlappies> talking bout volume, mine sounds so soft. does anyone know why?
[09:22] <big> hi
[09:22] <mc44> mordof: I dont belive so, I think you have to use vnc or somesuch
[09:22] <soundray> kleinlappies: up both Master and PCM volumes
[09:22] <poolkey172> jowi : I am using a mixture of KDE and fluxbox its the KDE bit that is messing me up
[09:22] <dogfood> hello
[09:22] <kleinlappies> soundray, they are
[09:22] <soundray> kleinlappies: then you need bigger speakers.
[09:22] <Jowi> poolkey172, if you use fluxbox as a window manager for KDE then it is the fluxbox keyboard shortcuts you will need to set.
[09:22] <dogfood> Which programming language are device drivers and fileystems usually written in?
[09:23] <soundray> dogfood: C
=== dogfood is now known as dogfood2006
[09:23] <kleinlappies> soundray, i think so aswell
[09:23] <Jowi> poolkey172, you will probably not ("probably" since I make a guess here) be able to set them in a KDE app.
[09:24] <Copan> Ubuntu says it's unable to mount my external hard drive (IOGEAR), can anyone offer assistance?
[09:24] <mordof> mc44: that's no good.. not sure how i'm gonna reconfigure my server, lol

[09:24] <WhiteRabit> Is there any way to force my X session into 1024x768 at 60hz, even if theres no monitor plugged into it, or even if theprojector I have for some reason seems to cause it to go at 85hz?
[09:24] <poolkey172> jowi : let me rephrase this question a little easier how do you turn off kde shortcuts :)
[09:24] <Jowi> poolkey172, maybe this will help or maybe it won't. you might be able to set it in the fluxconf application...?
[09:25] <soundray> Copan: how is it connected?
[09:25] <Jowi> poolkey172, i do not know
[09:25] <Copan> soundray: by USB

[09:26] <misiu_mp> VigoFusion: Happy to have helped you
[09:27] <Copan> soundray: I only see c01d Logitech, Inc, so i'm assuming it has nothing to do with IOGEAR unless it's made by logitech

[09:29] <Limulf> I want to install Ubuntu in a PC with a Kyro graphic card. At Kyro's website I've read that Kyro's drivers won't work with kernels higher than 2.4. Can I install Edgy and then change the kernel it uses? If not, which Ubuntu version would be my best option? Thanks for your time.

[09:30] <Jinkguns> What is the man page for cifs?
[09:30] <mc44> AlinuxOS: ask Seveas to add an entry to Georgia

[09:31] <mc44> *Georgia
[09:31] <AlinuxOS> mc44, aha ;)
[09:31] <soundray> Copan: the way to be sure would be to pull the plug and see if the Logitech device is still there. In any case, it's more likely to be a mouse...
[09:31] <Jowi> Raskall, use the "swapoff" command. change the swap device in /etc/fstab then use the swapon command to set it again. (man swapon/swapoff) also see this from the help pages for better explanation:
[09:31] <AlinuxOS> Seveas, here bro ?
[09:31] <Jowi> !swap | Raskall
[09:31] <ubotu> Raskall: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[09:31] <Copan> soundray: it is my logitech mouse then
[09:32] <mc44> AlinuxOS: try someone in #ubuntu-bots

[09:33] <quotemstr> Oh -- is there a terminal emulator program that keeps track of the current directory and that can spawn a new terminal in the same place as the current one?
[09:33] <soundray> Copan: it may be worth plugging it into a different socket if you have one. Again check lsusb for any changes.
[09:33] <daniel789> aww, the ants screensaver
[09:33] <AlinuxOS> Seveas, there is LoCoBot in #ubuntu-ge, but I can't change channels topic...
[09:33] <daniel789> yeah :-D
[09:33] <soundray> quotemstr: gnome-terminal
[09:33] <Copan> soundray: i have switched sockets, no changes, but im afraid i must go, thank you
[09:33] <Copan> bye
[09:33] <poolkey172> jowi : FYI you change the keyboard layout with setxkbmap ........ -options 'altwin:super_win'
[09:34] <WhiteRabit> hey... i'm trying to run my machine headless and vnc into it, but it always defaults to 640x480.... and i can't change the resolution... is there any way to force it?
[09:34] <soundray> WhiteRabit: run 'vncserver -geometry 1600x1200'
[09:35] <kharloss> hi there. i try setup a fresh kubuntu intallation. everything it`s fine but my pcmcia network card isn`t recognized .  any solution ?
[09:35] <WhiteRabit> thank you
[09:35] <ski-worklap> kharloss, dmesg | grep eth0
[09:35] <soundray> kharloss: is your PCMCIA card generally supported in Linux?
[09:35] <pantalaimon_> is there any performance difference between the vmware player and server?
[09:35] <ski-worklap> if that gives you nothing, what's lspci tewll ya?
[09:35] <Jowi> poolkey172, yes that is one way of doing it.
[09:36] <kharloss> yes soundray  : i used another Linux distro on tihs computer. IPCop
[09:36] <poolkey172> jowi : yes and so it has nothing to do with my fluxbox settings :)
[09:36] <poolkey172> jowi : just did root@ultra:~# setxkbmap -model 'pc105' -layout 'gb' -option 'lv3:ralt_switch' and my fluxbox keys are working again
[09:36] <knix_> Using the new seveas w32codecs bins (had to build them before a week ago) my brightness/contrast is messed up using Xv for playback, is this a known issue?
[09:37] <yggdrasil> how can i change the sound that happens after ilog in? thel ong rumbly tingly sound

[09:37] <quotemstr> Thanks.
[09:37] <poolkey172> oops sorry
[09:37] <Jowi> poolkey172, i thought you had a problem with keybindings, not the keyboard map
[09:38] <eliseo84> hola
[09:38] <eliseo84> ke tal?
[09:38] <yggdrasil> and maybe the logoff sound
[09:38] <soundray> kharloss: I would first check 'lspci' output for any sign of the PCMCIA controller.
[09:38] <frej> nome
[09:38] <kharloss> ok
[09:38] <kharloss> let`s try
[09:39] <Louie> Whats the font ubuntu using on loggos etc
[09:39] <Jowi> poolkey172, glad you managed to find out yourself :)
[09:39] <poolkey172> jowi : what is the default setting for uk keyboard ? pc105 doesnt sound right
[09:39] <soundray> kharloss: use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org for pasting if needed
[09:39] <soundray> poolkey172: works for me
[09:39] <kharloss> soundray :  realtek 3139C / +   it`s recognized   after  "lspci"

[09:40] <Jinkguns> Um, who was helping me earlier?
[09:40] <soundray> kharloss: run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and hotplug your card. Any interesting messages?
[09:40] <Jowi> poolkey172, depends on your keyboard. I need to use the pc105 to get the correct mapping even if my keyboard lack a numeric keypad :(
[09:40] <Jowi> :)
[09:40] <frej> rickyfingers: nautilus/konquere should work too (with write support)
[09:41] <poolkey172> jowi : pc105 is not quite : r u using a UK keyboard ?
[09:41] <Jowi> poolkey172, no, a swedish one
[09:42] <poolkey172> Hmmmmmm anyone using a UK keyboard that can tell me the output of this : xprop -root | grep XKB
[09:42] <Raskall> Jowi: thanks. it worked. :)
[09:42] <Jowi> poolkey172, the pc105 is about the physical model of the keyboard. then you can specify the language with XkbLayout in xorg.conf
[09:42] <Jowi> you're welcome Raskall
[09:42] <soundray> poolkey172: _XKB_RULES_NAMES(STRING) = "xorg", "pc105", "gb", "", "lv3:ralt_switchctrl:nocaps"
[09:42] <kharloss> soundray : how to  hotplug my card ?
[09:42] <matahari> hi

[09:48] <Winand> Jowi: the lady at the postoffice suggested I use a little box thing so I used that, which fit a CD jewelcase, a USB wire and the player too
[09:48] <soundray> poolkey172: try '/usr/share/onboard/run-onboard.py'
[09:48] <rickyfingers> noclue: am I not making myself clear? xmms is just a decent mp3 player that I haven't had any problems using in ubuntu
[09:48] <matahari> VigoFusion: where? never saw this before.... A function where i can say that a package should be exchanged by another one?
[09:48] <poolkey172> soundray : THE MAN
[09:48] <Jowi> Winand, cool.
[09:48] <Winand> jowi: i thought so too
[09:48] <Limulf> Hello. If I install Edgy Eft and after that I install a 2.4.27 kernel with synaptic, will I be able to run Edgy Eft using that kernel to boot? Thanks.
[09:48] <mordof> how do i output my cpuinfo again?
[09:48] <noclue> rickyfingers ok yes
[09:49] <poolkey172> ahhhhh no such file
[09:49] <soundray> kharloss: oh good. Do you get a stanza pertaining to eth0 when you type 'ifconfig -a'?
[09:49] <poolkey172> searches for inboard
[09:49] <poolkey172> searches for onboard
[09:49] <VigoFusion> matahari: I am on Ubuntu6.10 Edgy, and have learned more and more each day, I added the add/remove thing from the Synaptic Package Manager. It is like the add/remove in that flakey OS, but this one works.
[09:50] <noclue> rickyfingers i had sound working properly before re install on amarok i typed a sudo then it played ok just wondered if you know what that could have been
[09:50] <kharloss> my english it`s not so good  so "stanza pertainin "  it`s like  " sa`mi bag zdranga daca inteleg ceva "   ")
[09:51] <rickyfingers> noclue: sounds to me like a permissions problem when you do ls -la in the directory where the mp3's are, who owns the files? what group has permission to access the files?
[09:51] <pablo_> hi, is there any soft for editing pdfs or tiffs i need to rotate some pages
[09:51] <markus_> Hello. I get a console output like this: ;;;;;00:42:F3:22:H8:44;;;;;;.. wich tool do i use to delete the ; ?
[09:51] <soundray> kharloss: type 'ifconfig -a'. There should be at least two sections, or "stanzas" as I called them, because I'm a bit of a poet ;)
[09:51] <rickyfingers> markus: hammer
[09:51] <markus_> rickyfingers, okey thx.. will test that
[09:51] <kharloss> eth0 exist
[09:52] <noclue> rickyfingers the list comes up with lots of stuff that says log in name before it
[09:52] <kharloss> i guess it`s not corectly configurate

[09:52] <matahari> VigoFusion: do you have the name of this function in german too?
[09:52] <rickyfingers> markus: I was joking, as in you should just take a hammer to your monitor.
[09:52] <pablo_> hi, is there any soft for editing pdfs or tiffs i need to rotate some pages
[09:52] <matahari> VigoFusion: i just don#t know what it could be

[09:54] <Hoag> Hi all. I'm having a few troubles. I'm trying to run a .exe from a CD using wine. I type the command in the terminal, it seems to work, with no error message, but nothing else happens.
[09:54] <rickyfingers> noclue: there wasn't jack on the screen
[09:54] <soundray> kharloss: where did you save that?
[09:54] <matahari> soundray: could be...
[09:55] <rickyfingers> noclue: sorry the image got mangled in compression, or whatever, but I couldn't see the output of the command.
[09:55] <matahari> VigoFusion: Say, what could be the reason why Synaptiv won't use my debian packages i want to insert into it? i can#t select anyone of them....
[09:55] <mordof> hey so if i do /exec cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor, how would i make irc send that to the channel??
[09:55] <markus_> soundray, Then i get a > prompt
[09:55] <kharloss> in etc/network/interfaces
[09:55] <rickyfingers> now, I got to get some sleep, work in 7 hours.
[09:56] <GeForce> mordof: you want to send your system's informations on an irc channel?
[09:56] <soundray> markus_: do you know how to pipe output?
[09:56] <mordof> GeForce: yes :P
[09:56] <mordof> GeForce: not this one though, a small one with friends
[09:56] <GeForce> mordof: Go get xsys for xchat.... sudo apt-get install xsys
[09:56] <mordof> GeForce: i'm on irssi...
[09:56] <LordMiles> alrite laads
[09:56] <GeForce> oh.
[09:56] <GeForce> dunno then lol

[09:57] <soundray> markus_: try this: echo 'M;a;r;k;u;s' | tr -d ";"
[09:57] <VigoFusion> matahari: You have to select those in settings and options, the default is to accept, but things change. Just check the Options and select or desect any that you want.
[09:57] <soundray> markus_: should clarify things
[09:57] <metatecque> Question: Why doesn't ubuntu use my swap space?? It eats ram like pizza, but it hasn't touched my swap
[09:57] <johns^> that's great metatecque
[09:57] <GeForce> yeah
[09:57] <GeForce> that's actually good
[09:57] <johns^> you payed for your ram, so it's using all of iet

[09:58] <LordMiles> still havent used them :(
[09:58] <soundray> cbx33: cinelerra
[09:58] <mordof> metatecque: swap is space on your hard drive - fake ram - it's ALOT slower than actual ram, you don't want to use it

[09:59] <haxality> does anyone know how to suspend/hibernate a computer from the command line
[09:59] <cbx33> and is there a good howto about how to get it installed?
[09:59] <oxyride> I have a question. is "bulk" scsi in linux 2.6.x better than "real" scsi in linux 2.4.x?
[09:59] <metatecque> so 1gig of ram is a good thing
[09:59] <soundray> cbx33: I haven't tried, but there are some good articles about. Search LWN perhaps
[09:59] <mordof> metatecque: yes
[09:59] <cbx33> soundray, what d'ya think
[09:59] <cbx33> ok
[09:59] <GeForce> metatecque, hell yeah lol
[09:59] <lumpki> metatecque, linux caches stuff in ram

[10:01] <haxality> LordMiles: ...why are you here if that is your opinion?
[10:01] <matahari> thanks for your help
[10:01] <oxyride> windows vista + visualpc would be a killer-class product
[10:01] <LordMiles> lol Im justing kidding rofl
[10:01] <mordof> haxality: he's a troll.. simple
[10:01] <mordof> no feeding the trolls people
[10:01] <LordMiles> im really a mac user
[10:01] <LordMiles> mac > everything
[10:01] <haxality> ahhh ok
[10:01] <oxyride> s/visual/virtual
[10:01] <soundray> kharloss: do 'ifconfig' and see if eth0 has taken the address now.
[10:01] <haxality> well, mordof, I figured it was a troll
[10:01] <LordMiles> with our stupid looking os we are kings
[10:01] <tannerld> I got this error message this morning, how can I fix it? Unable to read configuration file '/etc/cups/cupsd.conf' - exiting!
[10:01] <haxality> but I'm pretty good at defusing them usually
[10:01] <mordof> haxality: heh
[10:02] <oxyride> lol
[10:02] <GeForce> LordMiles, I actually agree. Unfortunately, MacOSX support for about 95% of what I do everyday friggin sucks
[10:02] <haxality> hahaha LordMiles you better be careful, you're going to push the wrong buttons
[10:02] <mordof> haxality: just calling them a troll repeatedly over and over works good to
[10:02] <haxality> yes it does :O
[10:02] <LordMiles> lol im just kidding
[10:02] <LordMiles> im really xp user
[10:02] <mordof> LordMiles: troll
[10:02] <LordMiles> all my friends say xp sucks tho
[10:02] <oxyride> what's new in the oss world?
[10:02] <mordof> LordMiles: you big big troll, lol
[10:02] <kharloss> soundray : can we talk in private pls ?
[10:02] <LordMiles> and I should you linux but y'know
[10:02] <GeForce> LordMiles, :) no but seriously talking, I would be surprised how MacOSX would be today if Apple's and Microsoft's positions were shifted
[10:02] <GeForce> in today's market
[10:03] <kharloss> when i try " sudo ifdown eth0 "   says  " interface eth0 not configurate  "
[10:03] <haxality> I dunno. Apple is doing a lot of the same stuff MS is constantly derided for.

[10:04] <sirk> hello, I have installed a new soundcard to my pc. I used via_82xx onboard sound before. Now I have a soundblaster PCI 64. I added the module snd-ens1371 as it tells me to do on the alsa page. Still there is no active sound device. Do I have to do anything else after loading the modules? thanks
[10:04] <LordMilesb> oops

[10:04] <LordMilesb> As I was saying. I don't like linux cos its free.
[10:04] <kharloss> that`s my etc/network/interfaces configuration
[10:04] <soundray> kharloss: paste the output of ifconfig please
[10:04] <haxality> LordMilesb: seriously, you should stop talking like that.
[10:05] <kharloss> just  lo
[10:05] <LordMilesb> fine :(
[10:05] <Sugar^> Anyone got a suggestion for an telnet/shh client, ala secureCRT, where you can organise and script a lot of hosts
[10:05] <haxality> it's confusing enough for first-time users to sort out this channel

[10:07] <reverseblade> mvhenten, not working ?
[10:07] <kharloss> can you give me in private your configuration ?
[10:07] <puff> edd_: When does it disappear?
[10:07] <Joakim> I have followed the installment on ubuntuguide.org
[10:07] <mvhenten> yes, I cannot change the volume with it
[10:08] <edd_> yeah i tried to get this 1 working, i restarted and it disappeared out of 'networking'
[10:08] <reverseblade> mvhenten, what happens when you do so
[10:08] <edd_> i only hav wired and modem now
[10:08] <puff> edd_: Hm, networking is what?  The gui, an /etc file, output from some commnad?
[10:08] <Joakim> I have installed totem-xine too
[10:08] <reverseblade> edd_, are you using edgy ?
[10:08] <mvhenten> well, nothing really
[10:08] <Joakim> First of all
[10:08] <mvhenten> I can change volume with alsamixer
[10:08] <Joakim> What is totem-xine
[10:08] <mvhenten> but it's not how it's supposed to be right?

[10:09] <puff> edd_: I had problems with ipw2200 on my thinkpad, found that it disappeared every time I hibernated and resumed.  Figured out I had to "modprobe -r ipw2200" followed by "modprobe ipw2200" to get it working again.
[10:09] <reverseblade> edd_, sudo ifconfig and tell me what you see , card names and ip numbers esp.
[10:09] <mvhenten> reverseblade: is it so that the gnome mixer doesn't work with alsa?
[10:09] <Jowi> kharloss, network-admin

[10:11] <Joakim> I should record a DVD
[10:11] <kharloss> is plugged
[10:11] <puff> How do I force ubuntu to give me a new X login prompt?  I've seen this happen where it goes to screen saver, but you can log in as a differnt user instead of logging into the current session.  This is handy (albeit a memory hog) when I want to let somebody use my system without shutting down everything I'm doing.  I"d like to learn how to make it happen on demand.
[10:11] <ski-worklap> can gparted re-size a ext3 partition?

[10:14] <mvhenten> Well, the other thing I noticed is that the sound setup program doesn't offer me much choice - either esd or not
[10:14] <Linuturk> !webmin
[10:14] <ubotu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
[10:14] <soundray> kharloss: sorry, I have to go
[10:14] <mvhenten> I disable esd since I don't need it ( I have a sblive)
[10:14] <reverseblade> britt, RTF is no no from console
[10:14] <chi0> how do i get wobbly windows in kubuntu edgy
[10:14] <Bourlotieris> join #ubuntu-bugs
[10:14] <puff> LordMilesb: Rather, the biggest factor being whether or not there's a network answering (the dhclient stage takes a godo 20-30 seconds before giving up).
[10:14] <mvhenten> but enabling it didn't solve a thing.
[10:14] <plsDaemon> About NVIDIA, why installer claims I have 2.6.9-10-386 and not actually the one it wants( on uname -a )
[10:14] <britt> reverseblade: or whatever I can do from console
[10:15] <edd_> ok its not loading up on paste, but there is only eth0 and lo, eth1 disappeared on last restart
[10:15] <reverseblade> britt, there is nano
[10:15] <britt> i want to type using some word processor with formatting
[10:15] <VladimirBG> hello
[10:15] <britt> nano sounds like vim
[10:15] <lumpki> how about antiword?
[10:15] <mvhenten> ok67, I'll enable esd and reboot, see what happens. pretty lame tho
[10:15] <lumpki> nm
[10:15] <puff> edd_: Do you know what hardware you have?
[10:15] <ski-worklap> britt - nano is a lot more like pico, the editor you might have seen in use in pine
[10:15] <reverseblade> britt, may sound but vim is superior nano is quick and dirty
[10:15] <njal> anyone got any knowledge for getting the beta drivers working on kernel 2.6.18.2?
[10:15] <edd_> puff: what do u mean?
[10:16] <britt> ski-worklap: ah
=== LordMilesb is now known as Milezy
[10:16] <ski-worklap> reverseblade, not to start an editor flamewar, but nano has a lot of features that it didn'tused to have now - syntax highlighting, proper regexp search and replace etc.
[10:16] <reverseblade> edd_, less /etc/network/interfaces ?
[10:16] <VladimirBG> does anyone here have issue with an ati X1x00 series?(fglrx driver)
[10:16] <puff> edd_: I would suggest a) determine which kernel module supports your networking hardware, b) try modprobe modulename, c) check.
[10:16] <ski-worklap> the main different in my mind is that vim has two modes, nano only one
[10:16] <puff> edd_: And if that doesn't work, try first doing modprobe -r module name, then modprobe modulename.
[10:16] <benny99> how can I disable the kernel framebuffer ?? sudo dpgk-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesn't work for ever...
[10:16] <reverseblade> ski-worklap, thank you for introducing your opinion
[10:16] <puff> edd_: If either of those works, then this suggests that the problem is that somehow the module to support your hardware is not being loaded.
[10:17] <reverseblade> edd_, less /etc/network/interfaces
[10:17] <LordOllie> can someone tell me to which directory, JDK 5 is installed?
[10:17] <Joakim> If I have understood correctly, you are available to record DVD's into your computer
[10:17] <njal> benny99 that's coz you need to type dpkg not dpgk
[10:17] <britt> antiword soudns intresting
[10:17] <Joakim> Am I right?
[10:17] <reverseblade> LordMetroid, locate jdk
[10:17] <ski-worklap> reverseblade, hey, you said nano was "quick and dirty" :) i believe that qualifies as opinion
[10:17] <puff> edd_: Or is being loaded in a broken state.  Come to think of it, before doing the modprobe, check the list of active module s to see if it's present.
[10:17] <edd_> reverseblade: iface eth1 inet dhcp
[10:17] <benny99> njal: the reconfigure works... but ubuntu enables it again by itself :/
[10:17] <Hoxzer> +
[10:17] <reverseblade> LordMetroid, prolly /usr/lib/j2sdk or smt
[10:17] <njal> oh in which case no, not a clue
[10:17] <benny99> njal: is there a .conf ?
[10:17] <britt> does anybody remember LEWP
[10:17] <Joakim> Or is it just how to watch a DVD?
[10:18] <britt> or the DOS word processors
[10:18] <reverseblade> ski-worklap, yes I have clearly stated my opinion
[10:18] <njal> benny99: yeah in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:18] <britt> thats what I'm intrested in doing
[10:18] <reverseblade> edd_, wait a sec
[10:18] <benny99> njal: can I disable the buffer there? which option ?
[10:18] <edd_> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/834853
[10:18] <njal> benny99: I have no idea
[10:18] <edd_> kk
[10:19] <JasonMcG> anuone here familiar with xubuntu wireless on a broadcom card?
[10:19] <VladimirBG> will ubuntu's 6.06 munltiverse repo include newer fglrx driver package?
[10:19] <benny99> njal: hm, I don't think so
[10:19] <reverseblade> edd_, follow this one , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
[10:19] <admin123> can someone reach http://80.61.67.150/ ?
[10:19] <britt> antiword will not work for my purposes
[10:19] <benny99> njal: thre must be another conf
[10:19] <JasonMcG> anyone here familiar with xubuntu wireless on a broadcom card?
[10:19] <we2by> guys, i think nvidia-glx just removed my 686 kernel and replaced it with a i386 kernel, how can I install the i686 kernel?
[10:19] <edd_> ok ill take a look
[10:19] <brianski> admin123: i can
[10:19] <VladimirBG> admin123: so can I
[10:19] <britt> i find it hard to believe nobody has a console full-format word processor
[10:20] <Agrajag> britt: it's called latex
[10:20] <Jinkguns> Alright. I'll take one more crack at this. I've followed several guides and a few guys offering advice in here. I'm trying to mount a samba share via fstab, it does mount, everything looks good EXCEPT, fstab refuses to mount the share as RW to other users. Here is the clean version of the fstab line:
[10:20] <admin123> brianski and VladimirBG and now to??
[10:20] <Jinkguns> /samba.egr.msu.edu/web /network/web cifs domain=egr,username=bfortino,password=[censored] ,rw 0 0
[10:20] <brianski> admin123: yes
[10:20] <britt> Agrajag: down the right track
[10:20] <admin123> brianski, did you see xampp?
[10:20] <brianski> yep
[10:20] <VladimirBG> admin123: yes
[10:21] <Agrajag> Jinkguns: have you tried setting a umask?
[10:21] <admin123> thnx guys
[10:21] <njal> benny99: There may well be, but i don't know of one
[10:21] <Agrajag> is it possible to use a umask with samba?
[10:21] <reverseblade> britt, how many colors do console support ?
[10:21] <Jinkguns> Yes, umask 777 and umask 000
[10:21] <brianski> Agrajag: yea, it's somewhere in smb.conf
[10:21] <VladimirBG> anyone, got any info on fglrx? will it be updated for 6.06?
[10:21] <rasman> noclue, did you make it?
[10:21] <Jinkguns> Agrajag: it still mounted read only
[10:21] <reverseblade> britt, 16, console is for console
[10:21] <Jinkguns> for all others besides root
[10:22] <DevC> well off I go
[10:22] <britt> reverseblade: who said anything about colors?
[10:22] <noclue> rasman yeah
[10:22] <britt> i have a monochrome dumb terminal i want to use for word processing
[10:22] <noclue> rasman sorry i cant log register on here for some reason
[10:23] <reverseblade> britt, I am trying to tell you can't expect everything from console, it has limitations and strengths, console is not a right place to seek for a full featured word process
[10:23] <britt> reverseblade: worked in the 80s
[10:23] <britt> i dont care abotu full featured
[10:23] <britt> i just want to be able to layout a title
[10:23] <britt> centering text, tabs
[10:23] <britt> font sizes.
[10:24] <rasman> okay, you need to enable the restricted format for mp3
[10:24] <reverseblade> britt, like PW of DOS
[10:24] <mordof> when i do /exec -o how would i specify a max character length? like (only show up to 150 characters) or something
[10:24] <shwag> ughh...google reader is bugging me.  Is there a better reader?
[10:24] <noclue> rasman ok how do i do that??
[10:24] <H3g3m0n> shwag: Bloglines is the popular one
[10:24] <rasman> noclue, one way is to install lame
[10:24] <reverseblade> britt, you can install DOS box and try that old programs on it as well
[10:24] <VladimirBG> britt: I saw some text editors in source format when I read C by kernighan and richi
[10:24] <noclue> rasman sorry i am not thick just still learning all this lol
[10:24] <Agrajag> reverseblade: dosbox requires X
[10:24] <tuxtux> ri salve
[10:24] <noclue> rasman where do i install lame from??
[10:24] <rasman> noclue, run 'sudo aptitude install lame'  I think that is available off the bat
[10:25] <reverseblade> VladimirBG, I am 27 , I think I wasn't born at that time :=
[10:25] <njal> no you need to enable universe and multiverse to get lame
[10:25] <britt> yes like PW
[10:25] <britt> apparently theres a word perfect for UNIX
[10:25] <fhc>  MN,,VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10:25] <fhc>  7C
[10:25] <fhc> 
[10:25] <fhc> LO
[10:26] <noclue> rasman done that now what do i do will it play now??
[10:26] <britt> VladimirBG: have any source images i could compile?
[10:26] <brianski> an ncurses bsed word processor would be a cute hack
[10:26] <VladimirBG> britt: no, I don't unfortunatly, the source I have is hard copy, that is printed :P
[10:26] <marlun> I've got a webcam on my laptop and I would like to see if it works in linux, in what application can I test it?
[10:27] <rasman> noclue, I'm getting most of this from http://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[10:27] <brianski> marlun: apt-get install dream-on
[10:27] <brianski> :)
[10:27] <Agrajag> britt: are you sure there isn't some Emacs package for doing word processing?
[10:27] <britt> VladimirBG: but you know what im talking about right?
[10:27] <Agrajag> I mean it has everything else
[10:27] <britt> Agrajag: thats why im asking?
[10:28] <rasman> noclue, you need to also install 'sudo aptitude install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly'
[10:28] <tuxtux> for install xorg-dev
[10:28] <tuxtux>   xorg-dev: Dipende: libxfont-dev ma non sta per essere installato
[10:28] <marlun> brianski, you don't think it will work? =)
[10:28] <tuxtux>             Dipende: libxft-dev ma non sta per essere installato
[10:28] <britt> i have no clue, i just figured i'd ask and see if anybody else was as crazy as I was
[10:28] <brianski> marlun: i'll be very happy for you if it does
[10:28] <britt> Latex is very high level
[10:28] <brianski> but i suspect not
[10:28] <reverseblade> britt, I think no such editor exist for *nix
[10:29] <VladimirBG> britt: for text editor? I have a source but as a printed add-on to a book...
[10:29] <marlun> brianski, well is there a way to test it? =)
[10:29] <azap> random: can someone tell me why a C implementation doesnt need a garbage collector
[10:29] <VladimirBG> britt: that's 15-20 pages of source code there :P
[10:29] <Ayabara> I try to make a call wit skype, but get "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:862:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave". It worked fine 10 minutes ago. Any ideas?
[10:29] <noclue> rasman it still wont play anything!!!
[10:30] <noclue> rasman it just goes straight to playlist finished
[10:30] <crimsun> Ayabara: does skype work by itself?
[10:30] <reverseblade> azap, implementing a GC is a choice. If you choose C as a programming language than you are responsible for memory stuff.
[10:30] <newbie_> Does Ubuntu have 1024*768 as maximum resolution or do I need some drivers installed to get higher resolution?
[10:30] <britt> VladimirBG: lol
[10:30] <newbie_> errr.
=== newbie_ is now known as Rorviker
[10:30] <britt> sounds like a weekend project
[10:30] <rasman> noclue, can you install the gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly package?
[10:30] <noclue> rasman already done
[10:30] <GeForce> Rorviker, might need a better driver, or you can set resolutions in the xorg.conf
[10:30] <noclue> rasman do i need to restart or something??
[10:30] <rasman> noclue, I think I pointed you to an mp3 encoder not a decoder with lame
[10:30] <reverseblade> Rorviker, I am running 1680 x 1050
[10:31] <britt> i couldnt imagine making a mistake there
[10:31] <Ueki> hi
[10:31] <azap> thanks reverseblade, its a homework question, so i figure id jsut throw it out there ;)
[10:31] <Ayabara> crimsun, what do you mean 'by itself'? don't think I have any other apps using audio running if that's the question
[10:31] <noclue> rasman will that break anything??
[10:31] <Rorviker> reverseblade: could tip me on how to install some drivers so I gan cet higher resolution=
[10:31] <rasman> noclue, go to Applications --> Sound & Video --> Rythmbox Player
[10:31] <reverseblade> azap, why not try C#
[10:31] <GeForce> rorviker: What video card do you have?
[10:31] <reverseblade> azap, they hate homeworks
[10:31] <Linuturk> !perl
[10:31] <ubotu> perl: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language. In component main, is important. Version 5.8.8-6 (edgy), package size 3287 kB, installed size 11436 kB
[10:31] <noclue> rasman already done
[10:31] <VladimirBG> britt: mistake, no way, re-typing ~20 pages manualy... how can you mistake there
[10:31] <rasman> noclue, nope but now you can convert CDs to mp3s or convert wav files to mp3
[10:31] <noclue> rasman now what??
[10:31] <Rorviker> GeForce: I have a Geforce 4 mx or something..
[10:32] <reverseblade> Rorviker, default it should support, thus you have some sort of problems I guess
[10:32] <Milezy> lol latex
[10:32] <Linuturk> what is the easiest way to add perl support to a default Server LAMP install ?
[10:32] <rasman> noclue, did you get to the rhythmbox?
[10:32] <britt> VladimirBG: it's just C coe
[10:32] <britt> code*
[10:32] <reverseblade> Linuturk, #perl
[10:32] <GeForce> rorviker: hmmm do you know which video card driver you got installed?
[10:32] <crimsun> Ayabara: then test if audio by itself works.
[10:32] <Rorviker> GeForce: No idea, just installed ubuntu
[10:33] <noclue> rasman it plays mp3 in rythmbox but not in amarok now
[10:33] <compengi> does anyone have any problem with using samba on edgy?
[10:33] <noclue> rasman so i guess half way there lol
[10:33] <Rorviker> GeForce: I can only choose by 640 / 800 / 1024.. and 1024 is just a little to small for me
[10:33] <reverseblade> Rorviker,  that's something you buy. You have to know what video card you have
[10:33] <Rorviker> geforce mx 4400 I believe
[10:33] <Linuturk> reverseblade, well, I want to add the correct packages so perl will be enabled on my development web server on my laptop
[10:33] <britt> LaTeX is what i'll learn + use

[10:34] <we2by> guys, I have problem installing nvidia driver on edgy
[10:34] <Jinkguns> Thats it, I've tried every possible option in fstab to tell the freakin' thing to mount the samba share as rw to normal users, it just won't work.
[10:34] <Rorviker> Anyway I can se what video card I got or do I have to boot into windows to see it?
[10:34] <protolnx> hi

[10:41] <ubd> whats the name of the partition manager of linux
[10:41] <reverseblade> When my computer is idle, beagle uses 70% of my cpu, is there a fix for this ?
[10:42] <webben> reverseblade, there is no such file
[10:42] <Ayabara> crimsun, and it has worked earlier today. I think it stopped working when I pulled and replugged my headset...
[10:42] <compengi> Jinkguns, for file sharing
[10:42] <LordMiles> does aol 9 work on linux?
[10:42] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: it says unkown device
[10:42] <crimsun> Ayabara: your usb headset?
[10:42] <florent_> You don't know htop ? Get it ! (like top in console)
[10:42] <GeForce> rorviker: aiite do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[10:42] <Jinkguns> compengi: oh, I don't do filesharing. I just spend hours trying to connect to a beast of a university network
[10:42] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: but that is the name it says with iwconfig
[10:42] <Jinkguns> compengi: what is your problem?
[10:42] <GeForce> rorviker: after, nvidia-xconfig
[10:42] <florent_> !htop
[10:42] <ubotu> htop: interactive processes viewer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.2-1 (edgy), package size 42 kB, installed size 172 kB
[10:42] <GeForce> errr
[10:42] <Rorviker> GeForce: already done
[10:42] <noclue> rasman how do i get to advanced software manager??
[10:43] <florent_> ;-)
[10:43] <GeForce> I mean sudo nvidia-xconfig
[10:43] <GeForce> rorviker: u already done that?
[10:43] <tuxtux> notte a tutti
[10:43] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, do what I said
[10:43] <Rorviker> GeForce: Nope, but it's done now
[10:43] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, you have to know your lan name
[10:43] <florent_> !iftop
[10:43] <ubotu> iftop: displays bandwidth usage information on an network interface. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.17-2 (edgy), package size 30 kB, installed size 104 kB
[10:43] <rasman> noclue, go to System --> Admin --> Synaptic or go to the add/ remove and click advanced
[10:44] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, not lan name but interface name, check /etc/network/interfaces file
[10:44] <compengi> Jinkguns, samba was working fine, but it suddenly stopped.... when i access windows network in network servers i don't have anything in it
[10:44] <GeForce> rorviker: ok, now, go in your xconfig.... type sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bkp just in case
[10:44] <webben> Is there any thing else I can look at? GEdit for example, loads Bonobo and Accessibility at the console, then nothing happens.
[10:44] <reverseblade> webben /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:44] <GeForce> rorviker: then type: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:44] <Akuma_> how can i set a different background picture for each desktop?
[10:44] <rasman> noclue, you might also want to follow this guide, I do when I set up a new Ubuntu desktop http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu
[10:44] <eltese> Hi..Im fairly new to Ubuntu but not an entirely hopeless case :p But Im having serious probs regarding my NTFS partition with windows on it. Is this because Ive got Ubuntu and Windows installed on the same partition? I only have 2 partitions. One with windows and Ubuntu on it and one wich I use as a storage device... The later part is pretty crucial to get hold of as it contains several important photos videos and etc of my son :)
[10:44] <reverseblade> Akuma_, #gnome might be more helpful for this
[10:44] <compengi> Jinkguns, but i just came up with a sollution :) i tried to use connect to server thing and it worked :D
[10:44] <Ayabara> crimsun, no, minijack. but come to think of it I also ended a skype call then, so maybe someone else grabbed the device and fudged up
[10:44] <florent_> compengi, what's your problem ?
[10:45] <Akuma_> reverseblade: #gnome is a ghost channel. no help there
[10:45] <ubd> someone pls tell me whats the partition manager?
[10:45] <Jinkguns> compengi: congrads.
[10:45] <compengi> florent_, i don't see any groups present when i access windows network in network servers
[10:45] <rasman> <eltese>, What problems are you having?
[10:45] <Ayabara> crimsun, konqueror seemed to be the bad guy. it was listed when I ran 'lsof'. I didn't even have any konqueror windows open...
[10:45] <compengi> Jinkguns, thanks :P
[10:45] <rasman> <ubd>, gparted
[10:45] <GeForce> rorviker: tell me when you have the file opened in the gnome editor
[10:45] <Rorviker> GeForce: What should bed edited?
[10:45] <mc44> !ntfs | eltese
[10:45] <ubotu> eltese: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[10:46] <florent_> !winbind
[10:46] <ubotu> winbind: service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers. In component main, is optional. Version 3.0.22-1ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 1604 kB, installed size 4160 kB
[10:46] <reverseblade> eltese, works fine  for me same disk , you cannot install them into the same partition
[10:46] <GeForce> rorviker: Locate the "Screen" section
[10:46] <Ayabara> crimsun, killed all konq-processes and the sound is back... thanks for helping
[10:46] <ubd> bash: gparted: command not found
[10:46] <trojatra> Hm, whenever I try to install something via apt I get an error that it cannot be validated.
[10:46] <crimsun> Ayabara: np
[10:46] <Rorviker> GeForce: Done
[10:46] <GeForce> rorviker: Subsection "Display"
[10:46] <reverseblade> trojatra, ignore it
[10:46] <florent_> why winbind package is optional when we have samba package installed ?
[10:46] <trojatra> reverseblade: it doesn't let me install anything.
[10:46] <asantoni> question to anyone: Does Edgy ship with the QT3 libraries by default?
[10:46] <kingrayray> hey, does anybody have issues with pixmap themes?
[10:46] <eltese> rasman: I cant even see the windows OR storage devices
[10:47] <kingrayray> for gtk
[10:47] <Rorviker> GeForce:  Depth 1 , Modes  "1024x768" "800x600"
[10:47] <rasman> <eltese>, when you boot into Ubuntu?
[10:47] <eltese> the windows one is not important but the storage damn is and it is a different partition even
[10:47] <GeForce> rorviker: you will have various lines explaining the resolutions depending on depths. Locate the depth 24 lines
[10:47] <reverseblade> trojatra, ignore it :) seriously I don't know. have you tried sudo apt-get install xxx option ?
[10:47] <eltese> rasman: yes
[10:47] <webben> reverseblade, the only error noted that is an error opening usr/lib/xserver/SecurityPolicy
[10:47] <strabes> eltese: what exactly is your problem? what file type is the shared partition?
[10:47] <trojatra> reverseblade: yeah, I can't get anything installed via apt-get install or Synaptic..
[10:47] <webben> cant see why that would adversely affect gnome apps and not kde.
[10:47] <Rorviker> GeForce: Done
[10:48] <reverseblade> trojatra, try to search the error in google
[10:48] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: tried all names in the /etc/network/interfaces but all said Bind socket to interface: No such device
[10:48] <eltese> strabes: Its NTFS. And my problem is that when in Ubuntu it does not appear anywhere
[10:48] <rasman> <eltese>, the quickest way is to run 'sudo mount /dev/hda2 /mnt' if your NTFS partition is the second partition on the first IDE drive.
[10:48] <GeForce> rorviker: From here, just check.... it says like, "Depth 24", then, "modes" and the resolutions
[10:48] <eltese> rasman: okey. Will try that now
[10:48] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, sudo ifconfig , what interface names are available ?
[10:48] <webben> Any other things to try to get Gnome apps operational again?
[10:48] <rasman> <eltese>, do you need to write to that partition or just read it?
[10:49] <GeForce> rorviker: on the resolutions line, just add " "1280x1024" or whichever resolution you want
[10:49] <Guardian> hi
[10:49] <webben> (I tried logging in with failsafe btw and that froze too.)
[10:49] <trojatra> reverseblade: okay, I'll try...
[10:49] <strabes> eltese: yeah i was just gonna ask that
[10:49] <Guardian> please, what's the apt/dpkg command to list the dependencies of some installed package ?
[10:49] <GeForce> rorviker: without the space lol "1280x1024"
[10:49] <eltese> rasman and strabes: I need to be able to remove, read and well.. Do everything mostly :)
[10:49] <reverseblade> webben, 80% the answer is in the log file
[10:49] <Rorviker> GeForce: Then I can choose 1280x1024 or do I need a restart ?
[10:49] <strabes> eltese: linux can't write to NTFS - it's super buggy and dangerous - if you need to write, my advice would be to format it as FAT32 or ext3. Windows can write to ext3 using the program from fs-driver.org
[10:49] <reverseblade> strabes, that is wrong
[10:49] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: loopback(lo) and ethernet (eth0)
[10:50] <Block> which kernel image should I run for thecore 2 duo cpu?
[10:50] <GeForce> rorviker: u need to restart the X server. Do CTRL+ALT+Backspace, but when you do that, itlll close all your apps.
[10:50] <kingrayray> Does anybody have problems with pixmap themes for GTK2? None of my pixmap based themes work, they just use the color settings in the gtkrc and otherwise are unthemed entirely.
[10:50] <we2by> any one here has nvidia card?
[10:50] <webben> reverseblade, should there be more stuff written to that logfile whenever a gnome app fails to run?
[10:50] <GeForce> rorviker: You will be back to the same res, but you will be able to change
[10:50] <we2by> if so, what is the kernel module name in lsmod??
[10:50] <eltese> strabes: ok. Thanks =D
[10:50] <we2by> and what is the driver name in xorg.conf?
[10:50] <strabes> eltese: just go with fat32
[10:50] <reverseblade> strabes, eltese linux can write to NTFS safely with new ntfs-3g driver, I am using it
[10:50] <Rorviker> GeForce: Thx you, I'll try it now :)
[10:50] <eltese> reverseblade: ok.. how?
[10:50] <rasman> <eltese>, NTFS writting is not fully supported under Linux.  It is in the beta stage.  I've used it but it requires a ntfsfix command after every write
[10:51] <reverseblade> eltese, please google ntfs-3g
[10:51] <strabes> reverseblade: i'd rather not use ntfs for anything
[10:51] <jorgp> ntfs-3g works perfectly for me also
[10:51] <rasman> <reverseblade>, I haven't tried that
[10:51] <GeForce> I use ntfs-3g, but in RO only....
[10:51] <GeForce> dunt wanna risk loosing data
[10:51] <jorgp> read and write to a windows xp ntfs part
[10:51] <reverseblade> strabes, it is  safe I assure you
[10:51] <maxkelley> how do I stop the process that automatically mounts usb thumbdrives?
[10:51] <rasman> <reverseblade>, will that be rolled into the kernel?
[10:51] <reverseblade> rasman, no, I will give you  a link hang on
[10:52] <newbie_> GeForce: Didnt work, I'll try to add the resolution to the lower "lines" also..
=== newbie_ is now known as Rorviker
[10:52] <rasman> <reverseblade>, actually, I don't have any more NTFS drives except for vmware :)
[10:52] <Rorviker> grr.. Kvirc doesnt save my settings neither
[10:52] <kingrayray> Does anybody have problems with pixmap themes for GTK2? None of my pixmap based themes work, they just use the color settings in the gtkrc and otherwise are unthemed entirely.
[10:53] <rasman> <eltese>, The command I gave you for read only rights will only work when you are root 'sudo su'

[10:53] <admin123> kingrayray, you need to install the pixmap engine
[10:53] <kingrayray> admin123: which package? i see no pixmap engine
[10:54] <mordof> alright, i'm runnin an smp kernel.. but top is showing a process as 100% cpu usage, and i'm fairly certain that process isn't smp compatible and would only use 1 core
[10:54] <mordof> does that mean top still isn't showing both cores?
[10:54] <Rorviker> GeForce: No luck, added the resolution to all the lines and restarted X

[10:55] <reverseblade> Rorviker, I worked for 3 months to make my video card running correctly , so no hurries :)
[10:55] <kingrayray> admin123: i don't think the qtpixmap engine is the one we want
[10:55] <mordof> Rorviker: you're having trouble getting a resolution to work and it won't show up? what vid card.. if you have the intel 950 series.. you need package 915resolution... *shrugs*
[10:55] <kingrayray> i have it installed
[10:55] <gcbirzan`> hi
[10:55] <admin123> kingrayray, and tk2-engines-pixbuf
[10:55] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: loopback(lo) and ethernet (eth0) are the devices found by ifconfig but iwconfig finds wireless (eth1)
[10:55] <Rorviker> reverseblade: Hehe.. I just want a better resolution.. :)
[10:56] <cafuego> mordof: Keep in mind that on  2-cpu (or 2-core) machine, a system load of 2 means the same as a load of 1 on a single-cpu machine.
[10:56] <Rorviker> mordof: A Geforce MX 4400 or something..
[10:56] <reverseblade> Rorviker, and I want to sleep on thaiti beaches with a glass of rum on my hand
[10:56] <mordof> Rorviker: k, no idea then
[10:56] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, try sudo ifup eth1
[10:56] <kingrayray> admin123: ah it was the pixbuf one, thanks
[10:56] <Rorviker> reverseblade: Would also be nice
[10:56] <rasman> <mordof>, top will go to 200% with 2 cores
[10:56] <Rorviker> Guess I just have to get used to 1024 then :(
[10:57] <haxality> does anyone know how to suspend/hibernate a computer from the command line
[10:57] <haxality> ?
[10:57] <Rob|Sleep> reverseblade: Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1.
[10:57] <mordof> rasman: ah ok.. that clears it up
[10:57] <reverseblade> Rorviker, dig wiki.ubuntu.com, dig forums, dig, irc, dig google, dig your log and config files, dig man pages, and return to step 1
[10:57] <rasman> <mordof>, check smp by running 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' if you see 2 cpu's then you have hyperthreading/ multicore/ or multiple processors
[10:57] <mordof> rasman: i already checked that, it's running
[10:58] <LordMetroid> locate jdk... what?
[10:58] <reverseblade> Rob|Sleep, what happens when you type iwconfig ?

[11:10] <odat> anyone able to guide me throw installing a video driver from source?
[11:10] <stormy|> lzap, make sure you explain your problem in detail... lol
[11:10] <sulo> odat: nvidia?
[11:11] <odat> sulo, no tdfx
[11:11] <reverseblade> sulo, I don't think so, chances are I could help you are very slim, so no need to be sorry :)
[11:11] <sulo> odat: oh..
[11:11] <odat> sulo, i have the file i just don't know the commands
[11:11] <rasman> <odat>, are the drivers not available under Ubuntu?
[11:11] <stormy|> I am using a SATA drive... but i don't think that would hurt running LiveCD for now
[11:11] <sulo> odat: what kind of file is it?
[11:12] <odat> Rasman, they do not work correctly the forums say you can get it working if you install from source
[11:12] <Rorviker> linux_kid: You the the private msg?
[11:12] <mianos> the las message before the loginprompt is:
[11:12] <linux_kid> Rorviker: yes, did you get my messages?
[11:12] <poolkey172> anyone know how to fix realplayer : getting no sound after a system move : Do I re-install it ?
[11:12] <lzap> stormy|: make sure you read all messages lol
[11:12] <Rorviker> linux_kid: Nope
[11:12] <mianos> Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ...
[11:12] <mianos> Done.
[11:13] <mianos> Zvzbtz 6.10 (none) tty1
[11:13] <rasman> <odat>, There is an easy way to use apt-src to install from Ubuntu sources.  'sudo apt-get install apt-src'
[11:13] <odat> sulo, i think i have to build it from source
[11:13] <mianos> (none) login;
[11:13] <mianos> thats all
[11:13] <stormy|> lzap, how long ago did you put your other messages? I joined probably 5 min ago
[11:13] <linux_kid> ok, i will try
[11:13] <sulo> odat... cool so what kind of file do you have?
[11:13] <Rorviker> linux_kid: You have to be registered to nickserv to be able to send private messages
[11:13] <odat> rasman, yea?  cuz i installed what said was a sources file of 3dfx drivers
[11:14] <linux_kid> Rorviker: and how do you do that?
[11:14] <odat> rasman, ubuntu sources?
[11:14] <rasman> <odat>, 'sudo apt-src -b install <package-name>
[11:14] <lzap> stormy|: np thanks upgrade process failed (Dapper-Edgy), I have run Adept and it seems the process now continues
[11:14] <strabes> test
[11:14] <odat> rasman, should i uninstall the regular package first
[11:15] <rasman> <odat>, it would usually be to optimize the package or to modify the source code
[11:15] <Rorviker> linux_kid: Told you on private
[11:15] <stormy|> lzap, I'm not too experienced with linux, but I do remember reading about people having problems with the upgrade
[11:16] <DevC> does ubuntu not have asm or C/C++ automatically activated in the distro or do I have to get it myself?
[11:16] <odat> this is what it says in the forum
[11:16] <odat> I rebuilt the .deb applying the patch I talked about! The tdfx driver now works
[11:16] <lzap> stormy|: it seems upgrade via Adept is much smoother (it wont stop when one package fails)
[11:16] <stormy|> I woudln't know lzap, I haven't even gotten this comp to get to the ubuntu desktop -_-
[11:17] <stormy|> It freezes on the splash loading bar
[11:17] <rasman> <odat>, you don't necessarily need to uninstall the original.  If you number your new package correctly.
[11:17] <rasman> <odat>, this should work
[11:17] <flack>  Hey, I run ubuntu on a laptop and was wondering if there was any way to bridge its wireless to my windows XP machine, preferably not through a vpn (Note the wlan card would be on a network)
[11:18] <rasman> <odat>, install apt-src and then run 'apt-src install'  That will download the source code to your current directory
[11:18] <odat> rasman, ok
[11:18] <icheyne> I'm thiking of converting to Gnome, but I really like dual-pane file managers - like Krusader for KDE. Is there one for Gnome?
[11:18] <odat> rasman, the source code for everything?
[11:19] <reverseblade> flack, just use your xp as a gateaway
[11:19] <strabes> icheyne: gnome commander is dual pane i believe
[11:19] <strabes> pcmanfm is tab based
[11:20] <flack> reverseblade: I am trying to use the linux box as a gateway, really. (I want my windows box to be able to access the entwork the wireless card on the lappy is on)
[11:20] <icheyne> strabes: cool thanks I'll have a look
[11:20] <strabes> icheyne: np; I don't think there's a way to make them work with the "Places" menu in gnome though; that always defaults to nautilus
[11:20] <odat> rasman, still there?
[11:20] <rasman> <odat>, It looks like tdfx is installed with the xserver-xorg-drivers-tdfx package
[11:20] <odat> rasman, i know but it doesn't work correctly
[11:21] <chisefu> I'm trying to get my winmodem to work who can help me
[11:21] <rasman> odat, apt-src install xserver-xorg-video-tdfx will download all the packages you need
[11:21] <rasman> odat, I created a new directory called test 'mkdir test'
[11:21] <rasman> odat, then the apt-src command listed above.

[11:27] <odat> rasman, ?
[11:27] <rasman> odat, There is a quick way to use the patch command to take the output of the patch and apply it automatically to the source files
[11:27] <rasman> odat, I don't know that.
[11:27] <preaction-m> poolkey172: use openoffice.org?
[11:28] <chisefu> what is root?
[11:28] <poolkey172> preaction-m : Obviously ! But openoffice does have some quirks
[11:28] <SpAc> TLE, thanks. Reason being, I have another linux box that I want to mount a drive on
[11:28] <preaction-m> poolkey172: and MS Office does not?
[11:28] <rasman> odat, instead, just modify the src/tdfx_priv.c file
[11:28] <SpAc> TLE, is that pretty standard for gnome? This other machine is running Fedora
[11:28] <Hoag> I know this is a fairly long shot, but I don't suppose anyone here has had to sort out Ultima Online for wine?
[11:28] <preaction-m> SpAc: the gnome-volume-manager does all that iirc
[11:28] <Lin> is it possible install UBUNTU using FAI?
[11:28] <m15k> someone might help me with my WLAN - Heavily searching for drivers...
[11:29] <poolkey172> preaction-m : office is the baseline we must adhere to as the businesses run office
[11:29] <odat> rasman, well if you look at what is said about that patch it says it has already been included since june
[11:29] <odat> rasman, so my guess is it was the build from source that fixed it
[11:29] <patbam> hi, i installed vmplayer on my ubuntu laptop and it went about adding some "vmnet..." er... things to my network connection (if i do /sbin/ifconfig i see vmnet1, vmnet8... as well as eth0) . now my wireless won't connect. any suggestions?
[11:29] <chisefu> How do I configure my SCSI zipdrive on my laptop
[11:29] <Code-RZ> hi 1000 people!
[11:30] <poolkey172> preaction-m : you telling me that you wouldnt check your CV on windows before sending it out to a client ? ;)
[11:30] <rasman> odat, and add the couple of lines
[11:30] <SpAc> so mounting in /mnt/ wont be the same?
[11:30] <odat> rasman, how do you mean?
[11:30] <preaction-m> poolkey172: i'm saying i wouldn't write my CV in any sort of .doc format. Use PDF (which OO.o can export) or HTML
[11:31] <rasman> odat, probably upstream it obviously doesn't have it or the file would show the lines
[11:31] <poolkey172> preaction-m : what do you use to write a pdf then ?
[11:31] <TLE> SpAc: I have no idea. In general you can mount a partition any where you want and create a link to it. But in Ubuntu at least it is so that the stuff mounted in media gets shown there. I would think it is more general than that however. I have noticed that when you insert a dvd it is also mounted there and it's shown in those two places.
[11:31] <odat> rasman, so what is my next step?
[11:31] <rasman> odat, I ran 'vi src/tdfx_priv.c' and added the 2 lines from the email
[11:31] <SpAc> TLE, thanks
[11:31] <preaction-m> poolkey172: if you read what I wrote, I said that OO.o can export PDF files
[11:32] <LordMiles> haha woot nearly finished sppech
[11:32] <odat> rasman, eeee i'm not good in vi at all
[11:32] <poolkey172> preaction-m : ok pre no need to be stroppy mate
[11:32] <odat> rasman, can i use something else
[11:32] <rasman> odat, the only lines that need to be added start with the + sign.  the rest is for placement
[11:32] <rasman> odat, no problem but someday you will like vi/ vim  It took me 3 years :)
[11:33] <LordMiles> woot
[11:33] <LordMiles> nearly finished public speaking speech on websites :D

[11:33] <bradley> how do i format a usb drive?
[11:33] <patbam> any thoughts? sucks not being able to connect :-/
[11:33] <odat> rasman, i must not have that file or i must not be in the right directory because there is nothing in that file
[11:33] <rasman> odat, have you tried nano or gedit?
[11:34] <gre1> hi
[11:34] <preaction-m> bradley: just like any other disk drive
[11:34] <LordMiles> lol I bet im youngest here
[11:34] <gre1> how do i install just grub from ubuntu?
[11:34] <LordMiles> 15 here :D
[11:34] <LordMiles> and I still dont know what u guys r talking about
[11:34] <preaction-m> gre1: sudo apt-get install grub
[11:34] <bradley> preaction-m, how do i format any disk drive?
[11:34] <chisefu> gre1:  you need to double click the .exe
[11:34] <LordMiles> something about a lesser os system lol
[11:34] <rasman> odat, you are in the xserver-xorg-video-tdfx-1.2.1/ directory, right?
[11:34] <preaction-m> chisefu: please don't give nonsense advice...
[11:35] <odat> rasman, where is that located?
[11:35] <astroman> hi i want to transform 12-15-12 -0550 to 12:15:12 -0550 i use the bash command tr... anyone knows ??
[11:35] <preaction-m> bradley: System > Administration > Disk Drives (iirc)
[11:35] <gre1> it says grub is already the newset version
[11:35] <odat> rasman, nevermind i got it
[11:35] <rasman> odat, good
[11:35] <preaction-m> gre1: then it's installed
[11:35] <gre1> but i boot and it says no operating system
[11:35] <we2by> any chance to make the main toolbar a bit smaller??
[11:35] <gre1> i have 2 installed
[11:35] <Spee_Der> Good evening everyone.
[11:35] <rasman> odat, inside of that directory you will find the src directory and then the file we want
[11:35] <odat> rasman, ok what do i add
[11:36] <preaction-m> gre1: you may have to run the grub configuration tool
[11:36] <eneried> hello boys, i have an idea but i want to ask you before destroying my computer
[11:36] <rasman> odat, everything can be done as a regular user, cool huh?
[11:36] <gre1> how do i do that?
[11:36] <webmaren> i can't get ndiswrapper to work on edgy
[11:36] <bradley> preaction-m, i don't seem to have sys>admin>disk drives.
[11:36] <dfcarney> gre1: you need to setup grub separately and specify that you're writing a boot partition to a device other than your default drive
[11:36] <webmaren> it worked for me fine on dapper
[11:36] <eneried> it's sure to use two sessions at same time, with same user, one in Gnome and other in KDE?
[11:36] <odat> rasman, yup
[11:36] <gre1> huh?
[11:36] <odat> rasman, what lines am i adding and where
[11:36] <we2by> any chance to make the main toolbar a bit smaller??
[11:37] <preaction-m> bradley: anything resembling "partitions" or "disks"?
[11:37] <rasman> odat, run gedit src/tdfx_priv.c
[11:37] <astroman> hi i want to transform 12-15-12 -0550 to 12:15:12 -0550 i use the bash command tr... anyone knows ??
[11:37] <webmaren> has that happened to anyone else
[11:37] <eneried> we2by, Gnome? KDE?
[11:37] <preaction-m> astroman: please don't repeat, and use
[11:37] <rasman> odat, do you see the last 2 #include lines at the beginning?
[11:37] <preaction-m> astroman: use "sed" or "perl" instead
[11:37] <dfcarney> gre1: if you want to boot a device then it needs to have a boot partition installed on it.  boot managers (like grub or lilo) can do this, but you have to set them up
[11:37] <we2by> eneried, gnome

[11:37] <bradley> preaction-m, yes i installed gparted but i get an error when trying to format the drive so i assumed i was doing something wrong.
[11:37] <odat> rasman, yes
[11:37] <dfcarney> gre1: just installing the package 'grub' won't do it for you
[11:37] <gre1> then wat do i do?
[11:37] <preaction-m> bradley: whats the error?
[11:38] <webmaren> !ndiswrapper
[11:38] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:38] <dfcarney> gre1: i suggest that you read the grub manual
[11:38] <dfcarney> gre1: google will turn it up
[11:38] <rasman> odat, add a new line and those lines with + signs
[11:38] <gre1> i dont have time too
[11:38] <preaction-m> gre1: that sucks
[11:38] <astroman> preaction-m : any idea how to write it with sed and never user it
[11:38] <dfcarney> gre1: well, it would take longer for any one of us to explain it to you
[11:38] <gre1> can some one tell me how to configure grub?
[11:38] <preaction-m> astroman: yes, i know how. you're going to have to learn. read man sed
[11:39] <odat> rasman, what lines with the +signs?
[11:39] <astroman> come on
[11:39] <preaction-m> rasman: why isn't he just using `patch`?
[11:39] <rasman> odat, +extern void xf86getsecs(long *, long *);

[11:40] <rasman> <preaction-m>, because I don't know how to use it </hangs head in shame>
[11:40] <preaction-m> bradley: you have to umount before you can run gparted
[11:40] <odat> rasman, ok  no # in front of them    right?
[11:40] <gre1> can some one tell me how to configure grub?
[11:40] <rasman> odat, yep
[11:40] <odat> k
[11:40] <rasman> <gre1>, how so?
[11:40] <odat> close and save?
[11:40] <preaction-m> gre1: quit repeating yourself. in the time you've spent whining you could've read the manual by now
[11:40] <rasman> odat, yes
[11:40] <yohan> i want to use my dvi out and my hd15 out as dual screens and my tvout too, is this possible?
[11:40] <dbe> gre1, /boot/grub/menu.list
[11:41] <bradley> preaction-m, yes i did unmount it.
[11:41] <dfcarney> astroman: you'll want to start with something like "sed -e ''s/-/:'g "
[11:41] <odat> rasman, done
[11:41] <preaction-m> bradley: then why is it still saying it's mounted?
[11:41] <eneried> richt click on it and select properties or settings
[11:41] <dfcarney> astroman: i meant  "sed -e 's/-/:'g "
[11:41] <dfcarney> astroman: crap.  i meant  "sed -e 's/-/:g' "
[11:41] <odat> rasman, now what are we doing?
[11:41] <dfcarney> astroman: but you'll need to tweak it a bit to skip the - at the end.
[11:41] <bradley> preaction-m, i don't know. gparted won't do anything if i don't unmount it first though so it is definitely unmounted.
[11:41] <preaction-m> dfcarney: you missed the last /, and that will change the -0500 to :0500
[11:42] <dfcarney> preaction-m: i know.  i just want to give him something to start with :)

[11:46] <rasman> odat, okay I was able to build the package.
[11:46] <eneried> we2by, i think the option is not directly on nautilus, you must change your settings changing the themes of gnome,

[11:48] <bradley> preaction-m, do i have to install mtab?
[11:48] <poolkey172> lol
[11:48] <rasman> odat, fakeroot allows you to create the package as a normal user.  running the command as root is unecessary and dangerous
[11:48] <preaction-m> bradley: you typed exactly: `sudo less /etc/mtab` < correct? without the ``?
[11:49] <ajmitch> rogue780, poolkey172: stop messing with the bot
[11:49] <dfcarney> guys, please stop abusing the bot --  sure, it can be funny, but it clutters things up and makes it harder for people to read through the forum
[11:49] <rogue780> ajmitch, and we hurt you how?
[11:49] <odat> rasman, won't let me do it
[11:49] <MrPockets> someone wanna take some time and run a n00b through burning a DVD with k3b?

[11:50] <rasman> odat, fakeroot may be not installed or you may have to run ./configure from the root directory.  I wasn't sure if that was necessary
[11:50] <preaction-m> bradley: there should be something about /dev/sda# if your usb drive is mounted

[11:53] <preaction-m> bradley: yes, parted has a cli interface, there's also mk*fs and other ways, but gparted would be the easiest way

[12:00] <SoulOrb> poolkey172: I like gentoo alot, and use my main system on it, and run e17 etc.  But I got ubuntu running alot of places, and have some novices running it.  Gentoo is too heavy for a novice with no Lionux experience.
