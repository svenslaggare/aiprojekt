[12:11] <Kingsqueak> Luke: hmm looking, I'm not sure how Ubuntu handles that
[12:11] <wabz> well I'm not entirely sure it's metacity doing it, it might be upgrading something else to demands_attention, but it's _incredibly_ annoying
[12:11] <Kingsqueak> Luke: using the 'terminus' font fixed it for me in xterms though, and there is a console version of it
[12:11] <bimberi> bltgurl: there's a site with a list somewhere - hang on I'll find it

[12:27] <Luke> Kingsqueak: how do I make that perminate (and what is C?)
[12:27] <wce> can someone help me open this in the X  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:27] <Luke> Kingsqueak: i've been searching all over the place and cant find anything about this
[12:27] <Kingsqueak> Luke: C is a very default charset/language setting, not the best to always use
[12:27] <Kingsqueak> Luke: the weird part is, I'm not sure why UTF8 isn't working for you
[12:27] <jmarsden> Luke: C is the default locale.  You can put LANG=C in your .bashrc if you really want to...
[12:28] <rBlong2us> Pelo:... try Gentoo you'll learn cli on the fasttrack
[12:28] <Luke> Kingsqueak: so basically my font doesnt support UTF8 but thats the charset i'm using?

[12:32] <sn00p|> jmarsden, and where do I configure or start it?
[12:32] <jmarsden> Luke: Look for a monospaced console font with the chars you want and configure your console to use that?
[12:32] <Pelo> rBlong2us, I'm learning, stop pressuring me
[12:32] <jmarsden> sn00p|: TCP port 113
[12:32] <Luke> jmarsden: it must look in a certain dir though... how do i know how to format the name etc...?
[12:33] <wce> how can i open xorg.conf
[12:33] <nickv111> How do I get Ubuntu to reconfigure my soundcard right?
[12:33] <jmarsden> sn00p|: And how you configure your router depends on what make/model your router is...
[12:33] <sn00p|> jmarsden, do I need to start pidentd or does it already start after I install it?

[12:34] <Luke> Kingsqueak: ok
[12:34] <gradin> is there a way i can log denyed hosts from my SSH server?
[12:34] <jmarsden> sn00p|: I'm not sure, I think it should start by itself ... let me check

[12:35] <CharlieSu> gradin: i love it..
[12:35] <Luke> Kingsqueak: after I install this - is there any configuration needed?
[12:35] <gradin> CharlieSu: but will denyhosts conflict with my fali2ban script thats running configed with iptables?
[12:35] <timo90> hi my ubuntu gets stuck on the splash screen
[12:35] <hexion> hello
[12:35] <CharlieSu> gradin: no, it uses hosts.deny and not iptables..

[12:36] <CharlieSu> gradin: why use iptables?  use the userspace. That is what it is for.. Also, denyhosts has way more features than anything else out there.  for example purging users...
[12:36] <sn00p|> jmarsden, no and its not identd its pidentd a different program
[12:37] <kitche> rBlong2us: compile it but yet you need classpaths which is not "free"

[12:40] <hou5ton> If I want all the fonts on my windows box to also be accessible in Edgy / Open Office; is it as simple as copying them from the font folder in windows and putting them in /usr/share/fonts on here?
[12:40] <timo90> Pelo:I experienced that problem after i had successfully sheared my Internet connection on my network.
[12:40] <MrGiMmE> Is there a way to install shockwave on ubuntu?
[12:40] <bruenig> MrGiMmE, no, unless you use crossover office or something similar I think
[12:40] <bimberi> !shockwave | MrGiMmE
[12:40] <ubotu> MrGiMmE: Shockwave is currently only available for Windows. To run it under !Wine, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave
[12:40] <Pelo> hou5ton,  that's how I did it but not all the fonts worked , only the TTF ones
[12:40] <cafuego> MrGiMmE: Yes, by using wine and a windows browser+plugin.
[12:41] <Pelo> timo90,  I can't help
[12:41] <MrGiMmE> hmm
[12:41] <MrGiMmE> ok
[12:41] <MrGiMmE> Is it very stable?
[12:41] <hou5ton> Pelo:   Also .... I see that in /usr/share/fonts there are many folders.  I wonder if OO will see a new folder I put there, or should I put the new fonts in one of the folders already there?
[12:41] <neophile> Pelo, there is no menu item like that. I laso checked the package contents and ti doesnt install any .desktop file
[12:41] <Pelo> MrGiMmE,   try asking the ppl in #winehq
[12:41] <jmarsden> sn00p|: Ah. my mistake.  It is run under inetd which you need to start
[12:42] <bimberi> MrGiMmE: it wasn't when i tried it
[12:42] <Pelo> hou5ton,  try copying your fonts to /home/username/.font
[12:42] <sn00p|> jmarsden, you know of a how to for that?
[12:42] <Pelo> hou5ton,  and my OO sees all of my available fonts
[12:42] <timo90> Pelo: im looking on google for the instructions i followed in order to make ICS.
[12:42] <cafuego> MrGiMmE: Best bet is to run it on windows in say vmware or something
[12:42] <jmarsden> sn00p|: Try     sudo apt-get install inetd
[12:43] <sn00p|> I'm trying to find it in package manager
[12:43] <jmarsden> sn00p|: It should start automatically after being installed.
[12:43] <MrGiMmE> k
[12:43] <sn00p|> there isn't any inetd
[12:43] <Pelo> neophile,  that's the most I could do
[12:43] <sn00p|> something like xinetd
[12:44] <neophile> pelo, thanks anyway, its weard that there is nothing about it in google :(
[12:44] <Jager> !gimpshop
[12:44] <jmarsden> I just did the command I typed and it worked for me.... xinetd will most likely also work if you want to hack up an xinetd config file for pidentd, but the pidentd package seems to use /etc/inetd.conf and so (AFAIK) needs identd to work
[12:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gimpshop - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:44] <black_13> is it possible to turn a debian sarge machine into an ubuntu machine?
[12:44] <Pelo> neophile,  try the ubuntu forum
[12:44] <Jager> !gimp-shop
[12:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gimp-shop - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:44] <Jager> Arg..
[12:44] <timo90> Pelo will that help
[12:44] <sn00p|> jmarsden, yea i'm not finding inetd, i'm running edgy
[12:44] <Malachi> What's a good way to make grass grow?
[12:44] <sn00p|> jmarsden, xinetd - replacement for inetd with many enhancements
[12:44] <Malachi> Yikes.
[12:44] <hou5ton> Pelo:   Interesting .... I don't have a Home/hou5ton/.fonts
[12:44] <Pelo> timo90,  will what help ?
[12:44] <jmarsden> sn00p|: Edgy here too.  Just open a terminal and try     sudo apt-get install inetd
[12:44] <Malachi> Man, I'm not a troll...just wrong forum. Forgive me.
[12:44] <hou5ton> Pelo:   and yes, I'm viewing all files
[12:44] <sn00p|> I did
[12:45] <Malachi> Thought I was on blender...
[12:45] <Jager> Anyone know how to install gimpshop?
[12:45] <sn00p|> jmarsden, ok its installing
[12:45] <timo90> pelo this is the comand i think is killing my ubuntu dpkg-reconfigure ipmasq
[12:45] <sn00p|> jmarsden, i'm going to forward my ports brb
[12:45] <Malachi> Wrong channel* But I did have a question.
[12:45] <Malachi> Has anyone had problems with xine?
[12:45] <Pelo> hou5ton,  you are right there isn't one ,  must have been a link I had with something else I had intalled on dapper
[12:46] <hou5ton> Pelo:   ok ... well .. I'll go get a dl of those fonts and be back to put them in here
[12:46] <SeLvAdOrY> hi
[12:46] <Pelo> timo90,   I think you are talking to the wrong person, I have no idea what you are talking about
[12:47] <kitche> !hi|SeLvAdOrY
[12:47] <ubotu> SeLvAdOrY: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:47] <Kingsqueak> Luke: I figgered it out
[12:47] <Kingsqueak> Luke: in console    consolechars -f Uni3-Terminus14
[12:47] <sn00p> jmarsden, it still dont work, I forwarded port 113 do I have to do unp forwarding ?
[12:47] <SeLvAdOrY> I'm new i work on ubuntu 6.10
[12:47] <SeLvAdOrY> my Q is
[12:47] <Kingsqueak> Luke: you can switch to any font that way
[12:47] <Pelo> hou5ton,  if you don'T want to mess with your install ,  you could make a /home/user/.fonts folder and put one of those whatchamacall them links in the /usr/share/fonts folder
[12:48] <jmarsden> sn00p: Just TCP port 113 should be fine.  CAn you telnet localhost 113 and type some junk and rpess Enter?
[12:48] <timo90> Ok peleo: thanks
[12:48] <SeLvAdOrY> some website not worke on firefox ... webmaster say :must be work on MS EX or netscape
[12:48] <sn00p> jmarsden, no
[12:48] <SeLvAdOrY> how can i solve this ?
=== jinxi is now known as we2by
[12:49] <we2by> how do you start the kbfx panel?
[12:49] <kitche> SeLvAd0rY: you can't really if you want it to work on firefox
[12:49] <TLE> Hey I've got an issue when I try to use cedega, which I think is related to dri, can I use cedega without it? I tried to disable dri in the xorg.conf but them fglrx driver didn't load properly and fglrxinfo showed mesa. Any ideas on how to fix it ?
[12:49] <Dreamglider> why dont i have sound on youtube and ebaum videos ?
[12:49] <Dreamglider> i use Firefox
[12:49] <Pelo> SeLvAdOrY,  I can'T realy help but I am curious to know what kind of sites those are ?
[12:49] <Luke> Kingsqueak: thanks mate!
[12:49] <jmarsden> sn00p: Then you don't get have inetd and therefore identd really running.  When you installed inetd, did it show ""* Starting internet superserver inetd
[12:50] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: OK, I'm finally back.
[12:50] <Pelo> dreamer,  try flash9 beta
[12:50] <kitche> Dreamglider: your sound might be used by another program what flash do you have flash7 or flash9 beta?
[12:50] <SeLvAdOrY> it's programed by jsb
[12:50] <sn00p> jmarsden, I got 3 options in my router, port range forwarding, port triggering, Upnp forwarding, I always put them in port triggering and upnp forwarding and seems to work but I have no more spots to  input anything else in upnp
[12:50] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: any luck?
[12:50] <sn00p> jmarsden, yea it showed that
[12:50] <Dreamglider> kitche, flash9
[12:50] <dreamer> Pelo: que?
[12:50] <dreamer> Pelo: ah :)
[12:50] <Pelo> dreamer,  sorry ,  blame nickcomplete
[12:50] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: I needed help with my wifi connection. I'm connected right now, but I need to replace info in /etc/network/interfaces then do ifdown ifup still.
[12:50] <wce> Why when i type beryl-manager on X the screen freeses expet the mouse pointer??? then i have to restart X ctrl+alt+ backspace, a blackscreen appears and i hace to log in again?
[12:50] <Luke> Kingsqueak: changed my font but didnt fix the escape characters
[12:51] <jmarsden> If you can't do telnet localhost 113 and type stuff, then identd is not running, so router config will not help anway...
[12:51] <rBlong2us> do I have to restart ubuntu after installing Java
[12:51] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  not realy
[12:51] <Luke> Kingsqueak: afk
[12:51] <philc> I'm trying to copy a large file to another machine, but my network is terrible and the connection drops. I'm using scp. Is there another tool or protocol I can use that supports resuming? would ftp work?
[12:51] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: at least whenever I want to change networks.
[12:51] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: yeah if you comment out all but the 'lo' lines and restart, nm should take over
[12:51] <kitche> Dreamglider: wonder if esd is interfereing with the sound since I know arts can do that
[12:51] <jmarsden> sn00p: Need to get the Ubuntu bit working first, then work on router.
[12:51] <SeLvAdOrY> I can give the link on privte
[12:51] <Kingsqueak> Luke: man, I really don't know there then
[12:51] <sn00p> jmarsden, it shows that inetd has started
[12:51] <Kingsqueak> Luke: terminus should support the chars
[12:51] <rBlong2us> Pelo:  ok then let see this frostwire
[12:51] <john__> I just installed ubuntu-lite. How do I inxrease resolution... if it is even possible?
[12:52] <Dreamglider> kitche,  can i do anything about it ?
[12:52] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  do you still have the link ?
[12:52] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: problem is, I need a line in interfaces for pre-up ifconfig rausb0 up
[12:52] <wce> whats the beryl channel name?
[12:52] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: what is rausb0 ?
[12:52] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: I need that because it's a rt73 card.
[12:52] <kitche> Dreamglider: I would turn off esd myself but don't know how to do that since I m not a gnome user
[12:52] <jmarsden> sn00p: OK, if you run    netstat -nl |grep 113    # do you see a line of output about something listening on that port?
[12:52] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: not sure then
[12:52] <kitche> wce: #beryl
[12:53] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: well, at least I know if I have it that way, nm will take over. Thanks.
[12:53] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: I'll try a few things and get back if it works.
[12:53] <urmom> i am running ubuntu on an ibook g4
[12:53] <urmom> can i get java?
[12:53] <rBlong2us> Pelo: what link? I went to the website and installed frostwire and then java
[12:53] <Dreamglider> why cant things in linux just no 'work' out of the box :/
[12:53] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: at least it beats manually doing wpa_supplicant
[12:53] <sn00p> jmarsden, http://pastebin.ca/258969
[12:53] <rBlong2us> Pelo: why did I miss a step or did I do something wrong?
[12:53] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: yeah, I'm not looking forward to trying that.
[12:53] <Dreamglider> it would make life so easy for idiots like me..
[12:53] <urmom> well?
[12:54] <sn00p> jmarsden, can you tell me whats with all that orbit crap also?
[12:54] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: you shouldn't need to with nm setup
[12:54] <kitche> Dreamglider: everythign works for me outside the box but then again I don't use soemthing that has a sound server
[12:54] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: it should just do that work you
[12:54] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: onjce you learn it it will become second nature
[12:54] <urmom> can anyone help me or will you just ignore my request?
[12:54] <kitche> wce: don't repeat in there so fast
[12:54] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: really?
[12:54] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  the version from the front page of the site has problems connecting,  I gave you a direct link to the latest beta for ubuntu which works pretty well   http://www.frostwire.com/blog/2006/11/21/try-frostwire-413-ubuntu-installer-now-with-bittorrent/
[12:54] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: alright, I'm going to go, and try this stuff. Thanks.
[12:54] <Kingsqueak> dragonfyre13: yeah you'll need to do your ifup/ifdown trick but if it detects a wpa network , you should just be able to fill in the blanks with nm-applet
[12:54] <Dreamglider> true true, but at the moment it is so very very hard to even extract a zipfile!
[12:55] <urmom> does anyone know if i can run java on an ibook g4?
[12:55] <rBlong2us> ohh the noes!! Pelo do I have to unsinstall then reinstall or what now?
[12:55] <kitche> urmom: try installing java but probably not since sun only has solaris windows and linux binaries for x86 and x86_64
[12:55] <Dreamglider> i should never haev installed 6.10
[12:55] <jmarsden> sn00p: I just added a comment to your paste showing what I get -- not sure why they are so different.
[12:55] <Kingsqueak> Dreamglider: that's because you think you 'know' how to extract a zip, you do, just not in linux yet ;-) give it time
[12:56] <Pelo> rBlong2us,   I'd uninstall first,  you can do that from  synaptic
[12:56] <Dreamglider> hehe true allso
[12:56] <sn00p> jmarsden, I think something is wrong with this box, I'm seeing orbit crap in netstat etc
[12:56] <Kingsqueak> Dreamglider: I've used it for 11years and I still learn new tricks
[12:56] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: the trick is that it's actually easier in linux
[12:57] <jmarsden> sn00p: Well, that is fairly normal, assuming orbit is running... all part of the GNOME world.
[12:57] <Dreamglider> pstangcslv, i cant say i agree there mate.
[12:57] <sn00p> jmarsden, ok
[12:57] <sn00p> jmarsden, any ideas on inetd?
[12:57] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: linux = unzip somefile.zip :: windows 20 clicks to unzip something in winzip
[12:57] <tapas> how do i make ubuntu bring my wireless interface up as soon as i plug it in?
[12:57] <sn00p> jmarsden, its not really a big deal but it just annoys me
[12:58] <Dreamglider> but anyways, can anyone help me to get audio in firefox when i watch videos on youtube and such
[12:58] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: which flash you have?
[12:58] <Dreamglider> pstangcslv, 9
[12:58] <jmarsden> sn00p: Sounds like you'd want to check whether inetd is running OK, and if it is, maybe a minor edit to /etc/inetd.conf would do the trick for you??
[12:58] <bruenig> Dreamglider, are you using flash 9 beta 2 or beta 1?
[12:58] <diskus> pstangcslv: well, winzip is old and useless piece of crap :P
[12:58] <rBlong2us> what's the difference between Removal and Complete REmoval?
[12:58] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: Alsa installed
[12:58] <d4rkst0rm> envy is the best tool for installing beryl with nvidia
[12:58] <cafuego> rBlong2us: config files
[12:59] <Dreamglider> i dont know
[12:59] <kitche> rBlong2us: complete removal will remove everything to that software config files
[12:59] <d4rkst0rm> i installed beryl for hours... with envy it took me 15 minutes ^^
[12:59] <Dreamglider> i just installed 6.10
[12:59] <Discerer> Is it possible to have ubuntu and winxp on the same physical disk+
[12:59] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: do you get sound at all?
[12:59] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  removal will be enough
[12:59] <bruenig> Discerer, yes
[12:59] <sn00p> jmarsden, http://pastebin.ca/258978 thats all i have in my inetd.conf
[12:59] <Dreamglider> pstangcslv, yes
[12:59] <Dreamglider> mp3 works fine
[01:00] <Discerer> Doesn't that mess up the *nix/win filesystems?
[01:00] <bruenig> Discerer, you have to partition
[01:00] <ninpomonkey> I am thinking of buying Fujifilm F30, is it just to plugin and use like a usb pendrive / external hd on ubuntu?
[01:00] <bruenig> !dualboot | Discerer
[01:00] <ubotu> Discerer: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64) - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[01:00] <Discerer> thanks bruenig
[01:00] <Kapta1> hi all -o/
[01:00] <blanky> hey guys what vnc client/server should I use on ubuntu, can I use realvnc?
[01:01] <kitche> !realvnc|blanky
[01:01] <Kapta1> my first linux session, ever   :)
[01:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about realvnc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:01] <Dreamglider> pstangcslv,  the flash says i have version 2.0.21.78 installed
[01:01] <blanky> HAHA
[01:01] <kitche> blnky: you can it seems liek you need to install it yourself
[01:01] <blanky> I guess not
[01:01] <blanky> !tightvnc | kitche
[01:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tightvnc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:01] <blanky> kitche: yeah I remember, that's why I'm not gonna use it
[01:01] <blanky> :D
[01:01] <Kingsqueak> Discerer: I would get the Win partition shrunk and setup first, not using the Ubuntu installer
[01:02] <jmarsden> sn00p: That looks fine to me... not entirely sure how to test further...
[01:02] <tapas> blanky: xtightvncviewer is alright
[01:02] <Kingsqueak> Discerer: use a win util to shrink it down and make room for Ubuntu, reboot , be sure Win is cool, then do the install and put Ubuntu in the partition you made
[01:02] <tapas> blanky: and maybe tightvncserver
[01:02] <blanky> das what im gettin dogg
[01:02] <sn00p> jmarsden, did you do anything else to make it work?
[01:02] <jmarsden> sn00p: You might just want to reboot and see if that sets up inetd/pidentd better for you??
[01:02] <blanky> tapas: *nod* das what i got
[01:02] <jmarsden> sn00p: Not that I know of!
[01:02] <blanky> tapas: tank joo for joor help
[01:03] <sn00p> jmarsden, ok, i'll try and do that
[01:03] <bimberi> blanky: Ubuntu ships with vncviewer (Apps -> Internet -> Terminal Server Client) and a vnc server, vino, for remote control of the desktop (System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop)
[01:03] <blanky> bimberi: oh... *cricket*
[01:03] <blanky> bimberi: I love you *hug*
[01:03] <Kingsqueak> Discerer: the reason, occasionally the parted utility that is used to shrink the partitions will foul up the boot record of the windows install, it's easier to get that all sorted out first then have to repair it after IMO
[01:03] <blanky> long time no see bimberi :)
[01:03] <bimberi> blanky: long time no hug :)
[01:04] <pstangcslv> Dreamglider: http://www.debianadmin.com/install-flash-player-9-update-in-ubuntu.html

[01:07] <jmarsden> dts: what isn't working for you about cron?
[01:07] <THB> the package manager froze last night and now it wont let me install programs
[01:07] <aster> I would like to know if I can run Gnome-Desktop with my P4 1.8ghz and 512 ram properly.
[01:07] <THB> E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[01:07] <dts> jmarsden: it feels like the file isn't loaded properly
[01:07] <kitche> THB: and did you run that command?
[01:07] <THB> so I go to the shell and type sh
[01:07] <dts> or the command not executed
[01:07] <THB> then login
=== ailean_ is now known as Lahey

[01:07] <THB> and it says
[01:07] <Kapta1> help anyone ?
[01:08] <jmarsden> dts: I would just add a cron job that runs logger at the relevant time(s) and then look in my log files to see whether it worked?
[01:08] <Discerer> hmm ok thanks kingrayray
[01:08] <THB> No utmp entry.  You must exec "login" from the lowest level "sh"
[01:08] <_JECKEL_> hey....what's the name of the art manager thing for gnome?
[01:08] <Discerer> Kingsqueak
[01:08] <_JECKEL_> because seriously....i've been looking for it...can't find it

[01:10] <jmarsden> sn00p|: OK, so now pidentd is definitely working for you on port 113.  Now just get your router happy and all will be well.
[01:10] <aster> I would like to know if I can run Gnome-Desktop with my P4 1.8ghz and 512 ram properly.
[01:10] <killown> where I found inittab ?
[01:10] <dts> well, where does the error output of a script get sent?
[01:10] <killown> /etc/inittab not found
[01:10] <Kapta1> thnx, trying that
[01:10] <dts> jmarsden:
[01:10] <sn00p|> jmarsden, well i got no more upnp spaces
[01:10] <aster> killown: impossible
[01:10] <aster> killown: you should have that file
[01:10] <Kingsqueak> aster: unless he removed it
[01:11] <killown> I dont have
[01:11] <jmarsden> dts: By default, it is emailed to root.  You can put a line MAILTO="me@myaddress.com" before the cron job line to change that.
[01:11] <killown> find / -name inittab
[01:11] <killown> notfound

[01:12] <killown> I dont want login manager
[01:12] <jmarsden> aster: Yes, you can, for some definitions of "properly".
[01:12] <jmarsden> killown: telinit 3  should work for you?
[01:12] <killown> certo!
[01:13] <jmarsden> killown: That won't chahge it permanently, but it will change it for now.
[01:13] <bimberi> aster: that should be fine for Gnome.
[01:13] <killown> I put it in rc scripts?
[01:14] <killown> I want do autologin mingetty
[01:14] <jmarsden> killown: There will be a better way of doing that for the new "upstart" init but I don't know what it is right now... looking...

[01:15] <aster> someone can help me please?
[01:15] <tomiboi> i want to run dreamweaver 8 on Ubuntu. should i use WINE or VMware?
[01:15] <cafuego> killown: It's not handled via inittab, you need to remove the gdm init symlink. 'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove'
[01:15] <hikenboot> hello all I get the following dhcpd error No subnet declation for start (0.0.0.0) anyone with an idea ...I have been trying to figure it out for 2 days
[01:15] <phoenix87ta> real quick question.  I just installed ubuntu, and the root user already has a password set.  is this a default password, and if so, what is it?
[01:15] <mzli> tomiboi, crossover office will get it over.
[01:15] <killown> cafuego, xdm too?
[01:16] <tomiboi> ?
[01:16] <frederific> evening all, how can I change the default applications
[01:16] <hikenboot> tomiboi...use vmware unless you have a new pc then u can use xen
[01:16] <cafuego> killown: Not installed by default afaik, but running the appropriate command won't break anything.
[01:16] <budgester> pheonix:  sudo
[01:16] <gbw> hello, i just installed edgy, where can i find acroread repository? i have put multiverse but apt-cache doestn show any acroread
[01:16] <kitche> !root|phoenix87ta
[01:16] <ubotu> phoenix87ta: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:16] <bimberi> !defaultapp | frederific
[01:16] <Kingsqueak> phoenix87ta: there isn't a root user password, you use 'sudo' to do things as root, to get a root shell do 'sudo -i' then type your user's password
[01:16] <ubotu> frederific: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties -> Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror -> Settings -> Configure and then hit "File Associations"
[01:16] <phoenix87ta> frederific, to what?
[01:16] <aster> phoenix87ta: as user do sudo passwd then choose your root password
[01:16] <tomiboi> it's a 4 years old desktop
[01:16] <killown> certo!
[01:16] <gbw> !info acroread
[01:16] <ubotu> acroread: Adobe Acrobat Reader: Portable Document Format file viewer. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 7.0.8-0.0.ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 22368 kB, installed size 54692 kB (Only available for i386)

[01:18] <frederific> sorry, should have made myself clearer. When I plug in my digicam with photos on, it asks if I want to import them, if i click yes, it loads gthumb, is there a way to make it use F-Spot instead?
[01:18] <phoenix87ta> okay.  need to change some permissions for some reason :(
[01:19] <kitche> frederific: make F-Spot your default application instead of gthumb
[01:19] <Kingsqueak> frederific: there's a preferences for default applications in the gnome toolbar you can set
[01:19] <ubuntuuser> How do I ferr Harddisk space from command line
[01:19] <Kingsqueak> ubuntuuser: ferr?

[01:19] <rBlong2us> I didn't find that on the menus
[01:19] <ubuntuuser> yes
[01:19] <rBlong2us> if anyone know where can I find that options I would appreciate

[01:20] <frederific> Kitche, make Fspot the default for JPEGs?
[01:21] <hikenboot> jmarsden http://pastebin.ca/258999
[01:21] <frederific> Kinsqueak: Thanks, but I only have options for Web browser, Teminal and mail client in Preferences|Preferred apps
[01:21] <jmarsden> hikenboot: looking...
[01:21] <Kapta1> hm.. i guess i'm not running ubuntu 100% yet, see yah soon..
[01:21] <Kingsqueak> frederific: o.k. so when you refer to 'it' asking you, what is it?
[01:21] <dts> do cron jobs get killed if the tasks run to long?
[01:21] <ubuntuuser> How do I free disk space from command line?
[01:21] <Kingsqueak> frederific: are you running Gnome and Nautilus or what?
[01:21] <bimberi> frederific: System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media
[01:21] <Kingsqueak> ubuntuuser: 'rm' ?
[01:21] <jleemc44> Whats a good client for listening to shoutcast streams in GNOME? (Ubuntu 6.10)
[01:22] <bruenig> Ubugtu, you can remove stuff with rm
[01:22] <DralaFi> jleemc44, xmms
[01:22] <bruenig> jleemc44, listen
[01:22] <budgester> ubuntu user: do you want to find out how much space you have free, or do you want to create some space ?
[01:22] <bruenig> jleemc44, http://listengnome.free.fr/
[01:22] <dodge_Dart> Does someone has experience with ubuntu+sonyvaio? How does it go?
[01:23] <jleemc44> Thanks dar and bru <--for editing.
[01:23] <frederific> Kingsqueak: Yes, Gnome&Nautilus. When I plug it in, I get a dialogue called photos and music which has options to ignore, import photos, or manage music
[01:23] <budgester> dodge: any particular viao, I know someone running ubuntu fine on a viao, but not sure of the model
[01:23] <Music_Shuffle> I run Ubuntu on a vaio.
[01:23] <Music_Shuffle> I'm on it right now.
[01:24] <dodge_Dart> On a fs 640w vaio..
[01:24] <budgester> Music_Shuffle: can't you sit on a chair like a normal person
[01:24] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, what can you tell me?
[01:24] <frederific> bimberi: Great, I think that's it, thanks
[01:24] <jeffbrown> is there a "standard" gui console for managing which services get started automatically?
[01:24] <Music_Shuffle> budgester, I know...I tried. =[
[01:24] <AngryElf> is there any way to make the power save settings longer than 1 hour?
[01:24] <jmarsden> hikenboot: That looks good to me.  Is /etc/defaults/dhcp set to the correct interface?
[01:24] <Music_Shuffle> dodge_Dart, about what?  Does it work? Absolutely.  Does it run far faster than XP used to? Yes.
[01:24] <frederific> Kingsqueak: Thanks for your help, got it now :)
[01:25] <hikenboot> hold on i will pastebin it
[01:25] <Pelo> jeffbrown,   system > prefs > sesson : 3rd tab
[01:25] <bimberi> frederific: yep, looks fairly promising :)
[01:25] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, and what about the wireless interface?
[01:25] <hentai> i'm trying to get my headset to work with mpd, and it wants some address for it like "hw:0,0". how do I find out what address my headset is like that?
[01:25] <Kingsqueak> frederific: no prob
[01:25] <Music_Shuffle> dodge_Dart, mine's a desktop, the one connected to the router actually, so I have no opinion on that, but wireless in general for Ubuntu is sorta..hit/miss/battle much.  So I dunno really.
[01:25] <jeffbrown> Pelo: that isn't showing me much... I am  looking for someplace where things like Apache2 get enabled/disabled to run automatically
[01:26] <hikenboot> jmarsden http://pastebin.ca/259005
[01:26] <Pelo> jeffbrown,  that's for starting apps at boot time,   you might be looking for cron but it isn'T  gui , and I don'T knwo what else you could use
[01:26] <gbw> hello, which image viewer do you use, which is small and fast?
[01:27] <jmarsden> jeffbrown: Here (Xubuntu) it is under System -> Services
[01:27] <budgester> gbw: pornview
[01:27] <jeffbrown> jmarsden: that is what I would have expected, but that shows me a subset.  Thanks anyway
[01:27] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, and graphic card, did you tested ? movies , etc..?
[01:27] <Music_Shuffle> dodge_Dart, what about graphics..?
[01:27] <budgester> gbw: The name sucks, but it's a good image viewer
[01:27] <phoenix87ta> okay, I need to delete a stack of files that are owned by root.  I can do sudo -i in a terminal, but I'm not sure how to delete them all from there.  is there another way to get the permissions to delete these files?
=== blanky is now known as Blanky|CantTalk
[01:27] <gbw> budgester, iwill try it
[01:27] <pstangcslv> gbw: xv
[01:28] <jeffbrown> I thought there was an interface to all of the init.d stuff but I can't recall what it is
[01:28] <sn00p> jmarsden, still no luck
[01:28] <gbw> pstangcslv, xv is not included anymore
=== Blanky|CantTalk is now known as Blanky
[01:28] <jmarsden> hikenboot: OK... I'll try using your config files here and see if I get the same error...
[01:28] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, you're using the proper configuration for it, or a generic one? wich resolution do you use?
[01:28] <jmarsden> sn00p: It just *has* to be your router config
[01:29] <Kingsqueak> jeffbrown: 'update-rc.d'
[01:29] <sn00p> jmarsden, well I got ports 113 in my config
[01:29] <hikenboot> i am wondering if i should try the other dhcp3-server instead of the one i used
[01:29] <gbw> budgester, pornview is too big, i need a smaller app
[01:29] <hikenboot> whats the difference anyways
[01:29] <linux_kid> pheonix87ta: what version of ubuntu are you using; edgy or dapper?
[01:29] <phoenix87ta> edgy
[01:29] <Music_Shuffle> dodge_Dart, it autodetects fine.  I use 1280, and everything displays just fine.
[01:29] <hikenboot> also note ...my interface never starts automatically i have to always issue /sbin/ifup eth0 to get it running
[01:29] <Kingsqueak> gbw: just to display a single image or a whole dir of them?
[01:29] <phoenix87ta> fresh install, the files are on a mounted vfat drive
[01:30] <jeffbrown> Kingsqueak:  I really thought there was some GUI console for managing all of that... maybe I dreamed it
[01:30] <gbw> Kingsqueak, single image, from console
[01:30] <Narrchy> hows it going?
[01:30] <Kingsqueak> gbw: ah in console, k, no idea
[01:30] <gbw> Kingsqueak, like view myfile.jpg
[01:30] <gbw> Kingsqueak, i mean console, i can start it from console
[01:30] <Kingsqueak> gbw: well in X you can do 'display file.jpg' if you have ImageMagick installed
[01:30] <Narrchy> how do you access Windows files while using Ubuntu from cd? is it possible?
[01:31] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, which is your model?
[01:31] <Dreamglider> ARGH
[01:31] <Music_Shuffle> PCV-RX850
[01:31] <Narrchy> anyone know?
[01:31] <hajiki> hey guys i tried to install this: transmission_0.6.1-1_i386.deb but it says "Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6"
[01:31] <phoenix87ta> narrchy, mount the drive, I should think.  there's a giant tutorial for it
[01:31] <Music_Shuffle> Narrchy, yes you can.
[01:31] <hajiki> can you help me?
[01:32] <sponix> anyone in here use unrar often ?
[01:32] <gbw> Kingsqueak, i will try
[01:32] <dodge_Dart> Music_Shuffle, ok..thanks
[01:32] <gbw> Kingsqueak, yeah, thats what i want, thanks
[01:32] <Music_Shuffle> Best of luck.
[01:32] <phoenix87ta> oh, that reminds me, does the standard archive tool in ubuntu handle rars?
[01:32] <sn00p_> jmarsden, I got a lynksys router and is pissing me off
[01:33] <zod_> anyone know what's going on with the amaranth reps?
[01:33] <Narrchy> Phoenix, any idea where the tutorial is?
[01:33] <Kingsqueak> jeffbrown: there's rcconf for textmode that might help
[01:33] <dts> jmarsden: where do i pot that email to variable?
[01:33] <dts> it doesn't seem to work
[01:33] <Kingsqueak> jeffbrown: it's not installed by default though
[01:33] <zod_> going to http://amaranth.selfip.com/ just says closed sorry
[01:33] <linux_kid> pheonix87ta: System->Administration->Login Window-> Click "Security" and then "Allow local Admin. Login"
[01:33] <jeffbrown> I may be remembering something from my RedHat past
[01:33] <phoenix87ta> yeah, the URL in the room topic
[01:33] <kloud> can someone tell me if i can use dual monitors with an x1600 pro with seperate resolutions?
[01:34] <phoenix87ta> ty much, kid.
[01:34] <Xzyx987X> hey, are there any raw cd reading utilities like isobuster for linux?
[01:34] <Kingsqueak> jeffbrown: try 'rcconf' it's pretty nice
[01:34] <slid3r> hey folx, I gotta prob, I tried to make an archive (gzipped tarbal) and I had 6 gb free, the directory I was trying to tar.gz was about 6gb, well it ran outta disk space, now my HDD is at 100%, and I cant find the tar.gz it made so basicaly thee is a 6gb file sitting somewhere
[01:34] <Kingsqueak> jeffbrown: there's also 'bum' for a gui
[01:34] <jeffbrown> Kingsqueak: will do... thanks
[01:34] <slid3r> I told it to make the file in my home dir
[01:34] <slid3r> but it didnt
[01:34] <budgester> slider: try /tmp
[01:35] <slid3r>  looked there
[01:35] <slid3r> nothing bigger than a mb
[01:35] <phoenix87ta> narrchy, sorry, the great big FAQ in the chat topic has it
[01:36] <phoenix87ta> unfortunately, I think you'll have to do it the hard way
[01:36] <slid3r> tried an updatedb and locate the file name
[01:36] <slid3r> nada
[01:36] <linux_kid> pheonix87ta: then you can login a root from the login window.  If you would like to change root's pass., go to System->Administartion->Users & Groups  at the bottom click show all users and then double click root and then set root's password
[01:36] <dodge_Dart> does anyone know an alternative to kompose??
[01:36] <Jager> Will someone help me figure out why I cant boot into windows? Like.. someone who really knows this stuff cause so far its stumping everyone :-/
[01:36] <killown> telinit 2 to login manager ?
[01:36] <phoenix87ta> ty kid, and then disable root login when I'm finished?
[01:36] <masterninja> do i need sequrity on liniux? I just use linux for my homework
[01:36] <Jager> masterninja: no not really
[01:36] <linux_kid> ya, disable it
[01:36] <jleemc44> what folder in the file system holds the launchers? (For firefox, xmms ect.). Thanks
[01:37] <jmarsden> dts: In a separate line in the config file, just above the cron job(s) you want it to affect.  At the top of the crontab file, if you want it to apply to all lines in the file.
[01:37] <linux_kid> dodge_Dart: what is Kompose?
[01:37] <phoenix87ta> masterninja, a hardware firewall might be nice
[01:37] <killown> telinit 2 to login manager ?
[01:37] <wce>  why when i try to open beryl from X my screen craches exept my pointer and wher i typed beryl-manager on X it says this
[01:37] <wce>  XGL not found, looking  for nvidia, nvidia present, relaunching beryl with _GL_Yield="NOTHING"
[01:37] <jerp> masterninja, no not really
[01:37] <Jager> Will someone help me figure out why I cant boot into windows?
[01:38] <dts> jmarsden: cool, got it ;-) One more cron question: are the jobs killed after a certain amount of time, it really seems like it
[01:38] <linux_kid> Jager: how far can you get?
[01:38] <dodge_Dart> linux_kid, a task switcher
[01:38] <masterninja> what firewall should i get?
[01:38] <phoenix87ta> jager, what kind of setup?  that's pretty vague
[01:38] <jmarsden> hikenboot: Well, I'm seeing similar errors to you here also... HAve not run dhcpd under Ubuntu, but run it under various other Linuxes and *BSD ...
[01:38] <jmarsden> dts: No, they run to completion, or should.
[01:38] <[erisco] > what can I do with a .run file under Ubuntu?
[01:38] <killown> please
[01:38] <phoenix87ta> masterninja, most standard routers and DSL/Cable modems have a hardware firewall installed
[01:38] <[erisco] > or better said, how do I execute it
[01:38] <bimberi> jleemc44: /usr/share/applications
[01:38] <killown> My login manager dont works
[01:38] <killown> what
[01:39] <killown> I do?
[01:39] <masterninja> i turned that all off
[01:39] <Jager> phoenix87ta: Um.. setup? im using ubuntu.. and i have windows and grub to switch between the two? >_>
[01:39] <dts> jmarsden: hmm, the logs just stop in the middle
[01:39] <masterninja> :p easier to host game servers
[01:39] <kloud> can someone tell me if i can use dual monitors with an x1600 pro with seperate resolutions?
[01:39] <Kingsqueak> masterninja: you can install 'firestarter' for an easy one to run and setup
[01:39] <phoenix87ta> jager, k
[01:39] <masterninja> so thats all i need?
[01:39] <jmarsden> [erisco] : what does     file myfile.run   say about it -- what sort of a file is it really, in other words?
[01:39] <Kingsqueak> masterninja: yup
[01:39] <phoenix87ta> masterninja, basically
[01:39] <masterninja> k ill download it
[01:39] <bimberi> !firewall | masterninja
[01:39] <ubotu> masterninja: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[01:40] <linux_kid> [erisco]  in terminal type in "sudo sh dir/directory/to/the/file/file.run"
[01:40] <zhangsen_> Would anyone recommend a podcast client?:)

[01:40] <killown> please
[01:40] <masterninja> no idea theres loads of podcast programs
[01:40] <killown> My login manager dont works what I do?
[01:40] <Kingsqueak> masterninja: you do know about 'sudo apt-get install firestarter' right?
[01:40] <masterninja> yeah
[01:40] <Kingsqueak> masterninja: k
[01:40] <zhangsen_> A podcast client which supports http proxy.
[01:40] <linux_kid> killown: what happens when you try to login?
[01:40] <Jager> When I select Windows XP Professional from the GRUB loader it just sits there saying "Starting up....."

[01:43] <P2500> Music_Shuffle: Guess!
[01:43] <masterninja> its worth getting its completly useless but beryl looks cool

[01:57] <xamox> what's the easy way to get java 1.5 on 6.06? Is there a package floating around?
[01:58] <linux_kid> [erisco]  hmmm..... well since it wasn't a .deb package, this may be a little tough...
[01:58] <Gumby> can anyone tell me if there is a way within ubuntu to change the display driver graphically
[01:58] <jmarsden> [erisco] : Since it instaleld just by running a program, you'll need to find out what it put where and rm them by hand, I think?
[01:58] <[erisco] > linux_kid, and just removing the directory is a bad idea? hehe
[01:58] <P2500> Jager: What does your grub.conf file read?
[01:58] <nicktastic> Is there a floppy-based installer for Edgy? Like Debian's netinst floppies? I have no CD-ROM...
[01:58] <dragonfyre13> Kingsqueak: Ok, I just had issues with network manager. I used connection manager, and commented out the one line that specified the ssid, and it works perfectly now.
[01:58] <malt> yo Kingsqueak pm plz
[01:58] <pstangcslv> [erisco] : rm -R -f the directory
[01:58] <Jager> p2500: Let me check
[01:58] <jmarsden> [erisco] : If it put everything into one directory, removing that directory is probably a good approach.

[01:59] <linux_kid> [erisco]  hey, i used to do that in windows all the time, and eventually the registry broke, but that's windows and linux has no registry
[01:59] <jerp> jager, take a look here.... http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
[01:59] <Jager> p2500: Where is the grub.confg located?
[01:59] <dragonfyre13> I want to do it through the repos, but I followed that howto, and it gives me the following error.
[01:59] <dragonfyre13> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[01:59] <dragonfyre13> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[01:59] <jmarsden> TokenBad: It is a bzip file?  Hmmm, so try using bunzip2 to look at it?
[01:59] <cello_rasp> what's the command for the nvidal config thingy
[01:59] <AlbinoRhino> So if I run fdisk/mbr on my windows laptop it could fix my issue of having to have my linux drive plugged in to run xp?
[01:59] <[erisco] > jmarsden, pstangcslv, linux_kid, well if nothing is going to blow up if I just remove the directory.. it is all the same to me
[02:00] <AlbinoRhino> otherwise it just gives me Error 21
[02:00] <dragonfyre13> cello_rasp: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[02:00] <jeffreyb> dragonfyre13, use automatix2 app to do it
[02:00] <pstangcslv> [erisco] : no problems
[02:00] <LjL> !automatix | jeffreyb, dragonfyre13
[02:00] <ubotu> jeffreyb, dragonfyre13: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[02:00] <jmarsden> AlbinoRhino: Probably, but after that you may have issues with Linux booting... would need to reinstall GRUB for Linux, most likely.
[02:00] <dragonfyre13> jeffreyb: will that auto update itself?
[02:00] <linux_kid> [erisco]  hust delete the directory, how it didn't touch anything else
[02:00] <linux_kid> [erisco]  sorry, not hust, but just
[02:01] <AlbinoRhino> ok so I will try it and then work on the linux if it gives me issus

[02:02] <CientificoLoco> how do I unistall amsn??
[02:02] <[erisco] > jmarsden, pstangcslv, linux_kid, I don't care what they say but Linux gaming is really crappy :P
[02:02] <xamox> bimberi, Ahh, thank you I did not have multiverse in my repository.
[02:02] <bimberi> xamox: yw :)
[02:02] <dragonfyre13> jeffreyb: well, that works for me. My problem was, every time it would update the kernel, it would break X with the manually installed drivers. Does automatix do that?
[02:02] <Music_Shuffle> dragonfyre13, using automatix is totally your choice, but most people here will caution you against it.
[02:02] <jeffreyb> dragonfyre13, i have used automatix2 with no problems... stable for me.. ymmv
[02:02] <P2500> Jager: Mybad, I was being unfocused. I meant /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:02] <Music_Shuffle> !works for me
[02:02] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[02:02] <linux_kid> [erisco] , good idea, and yes, linux gmaming is CRAPPY, thats why Mr. Bill Gates it on this planet! :D
[02:02] <AlbinoRhino> Automatix is hyped up on the forums alot, wonder why?

[02:07] <Music_Shuffle> So what's broken?

[02:07] <MikeyMike> hey my nautilus isn't handling thumbnails properly lately is there anything i can do to force it to re-read the images in a certain directory? i've set it to 'always' and 'under 10 megs' and its not showing thumbnails
[02:07] <Music_Shuffle> Just wondering, what card?
[02:08] <dragonfyre13> Music_Shuffle: nvidia drivers have glx extensions, and hardware rendering support.
[02:08] <dragonfyre13> Music_Shuffle: Geforce Go 6100
[02:08] <Music_Shuffle> Ahh
[02:08] <jmarsden> hikenboot: Yes, it is something about either that dhcpd.conf file or the network interface configuration itself...  I've done this on otehr Linuxes and on *BSD many many times, but not on Ubuntu... shouldn't be any difference though.

[02:20] <newpZ> Hi,
[02:20] <newpZ> somebody at the rt2x00 forum told me that the rt2400 driver is incompatible with an smp-enabled kernel. The default ubuntu kernel has smp enabled and thus the crash.

[02:32] <wasp_ems> like u use to make a guide
[02:32] <dogfood> Suparbh, there are more than one files on dd-wrt, looks like dd-wrt.v23 SP2 is the latest firmware
[02:32] <bimberi> wasp_ems: Desktop record?  There is istanbul.  Though I'm yet to hear anyone say that it's fantastic.
[02:32] <AlbinoRhino> there are programs in the add/remove programs section wasp_ems that let you do that

=== foxj is now known as jas
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> oh, so I put the exclusions into a file, and then route tar to that file?
[02:36] <jmarsden> Megaqwerty: Yes.  Maybe:   echo "media" >>myexcludes.txt and then tar ..... -X myexcludes.txt
[02:36] <Narrchy> anyone have any idea?
[02:36] <cafuego> dogfood: dd-wrt any good? I flashed mine with openwrt rc6 last night :-)
[02:36] <Megaqwerty> jmarsden: thanks!

[02:39] <jbroome> Narrchy: go ask in #cedega
[02:39] <AlbinoRhino> I use Songbird though
[02:39] <dogfood> Albino: the question is how do you get firefox to recognize xmms a valid mms player?
[02:39] <dogfood> It's not in the 'edit actions' list
[02:39] <[erisco] > My openoffice spellchecker isn't working anymore. Is this a known bug?

[02:49] <ScreaminIke> oh, you seemed to know more than me, and to type faster. so i figured i'd be less help than you would to kweiner
[02:49] <bruenig> kweiner, perhaps you should check your fstab, I don't recall sde1 ever being used. maybe it means sda1
[02:50] <ScreaminIke> masterninja, how do i put in an ssid?
[02:50] <kweiner> I mounted sda1 and looked for fstab, but couldn't find it

[03:07] <Keyseir> It burned at 2.4x
[03:08] <grandmaster_S> i`ll be back in 5 minutest
[03:08] <jmarsden> Keyseir: burn it again, at a slower speed and preferably using a different brand of DVD media

[03:08] <AlbinoRhino> I had to burn mine at 1x
[03:08] <Keyseir> jmarsden, I set it to burn at 1x so I assume it was going as slow as my dvd burner could go. I only have the one kind of dvds, but I also have regular cdrs.
[03:08] <zspada15> what i need to do is reload all the packages and install them
[03:09] <hajiki> hey i ran ./configure to  to compile a package and it appears that i dont have gtk and openssl

[03:22] <Narrchy> anyone have any idea on getting the universe thing to work the guide is only getting me as far as opening up the sources.list
[03:22] <H3g3m0n> RxDx: I recomend x86, amd64 has problems with flash, codecs and some other stuff but no real advantage, also seems buggier
[03:22] <cremis> help with beryl
[03:22] <grandmaster_S> jmarsden, i have to reboot to check that
[03:22] <hajiki> hey cremis it helped a little

[03:22] <grandmaster_S> so  reboot
[03:22] <jmarsden> grandmaster_S: OK.  If it works, try adding   the line   nameserver 4.2.2.1 to /etc/resolv.conf
[03:23] <grandmaster_S> and if not
[03:23] <RxDx> H3g3m0n: thanks.. ill keep my 32bit =)

[03:23] <d3cod3> whoops
[03:23] <Madpilot> d3cod3, time for a new password...
[03:23] <jmarsden> grandmaster_S: If not, get the output of ifconfig eth0 just so we can check that.
[03:23] <RxDx> bimberi, thank you
[03:24] <bimberi> RxDx: yw :)
[03:24] <grandmaster_S> and where do i have to add the line?
[03:24] <d3cod3> kk. i just need some really quick help.
[03:24] <hikenboot> jmarsden, go figure I installed dhcp3-server instead of dhcpd deamon and it worked as soon as i installed with that cofig
[03:24] <noelferreira> i need to update my kernel. anyone can help me?
[03:24] <hikenboot> s/cofig/config
[03:24] <jmarsden> grandmaster_S: Just add a line that says     nameserver 4.2.2.1      to the file /etc/resolv.conf.
[03:25] <d3cod3> i downlaoded the new version of java so i cna run frostwire... how do i install it?
[03:25] <w3ccv> you router should handle name service too   /etc/resolv.conf  should read   nameserver 192.168.1.1
[03:25] <jmarsden> noelferreira: You don't really need to do that, do you?  What strange hardware are you trying to use that NEEDS the latest kernel?
[03:25] <noelferreira> i have an old one jmarsden 2.6.15.23
[03:25] <jmarsden> w3ccv: Well, if the router was set up perfectly DHCP would have already done that ...
[03:26] <Narrchy> how do i give myself permission to overwrite a sources.list file?
[03:26] <jmarsden> noelferreira: And what is broken with it... what is the *need*
[03:26] <noelferreira> jmarsden: my auto update doesn't worked for me
[03:26] <cremis> hajiki try sudo apt-get install libgtk2-dev
[03:26] <hockyhair> jmarsden: so do you know about a gui for something similar to du -h
[03:26] <jmarsden> noelferreira: Then you need to fix auto-update!
[03:26] <noelferreira> how jmarsden?
[03:26] <jmarsden> hockyhair: No, I'm more of a CLI person, sorry!
[03:26] <hajiki> ok
[03:26] <bimberi> d3cod3: what version of Ubuntu?
[03:27] <tomiboi>  creating configuration directory '/home/tomasz/.wine'...  this is what i keep getting  what's going on?
[03:27] <d3cod3> uh 6.06
[03:27] <w3ccv> how do I get a WEP 128 to work with my router - it works open
[03:27] <hajiki> E: Couldn't find package libgtk2-dev
[03:27] <noelferreira> every time that comes a new kernel the system update but it never worked jmarsden
[03:27] <hockyhair> what is taking up the space on my drive!!!
[03:27] <hockyhair> this suxbad
[03:27] <jmarsden> noelferreira: That depends on what "broken" means... what happens when you do   sudo apt-get update
[03:27] <bimberi> d3cod3: you can (and should) download and install Java using synaptic/apt-get - the packages are in multiverse and have names like sun-java5-*
[03:27] <cremis> libgtk2.0-dev
[03:27] <hajiki> oh
[03:27] <bimberi> ubotu: tell d3cod3 about java | via /msg
[03:28] <noelferreira> erros with keys jmarsden
[03:28] <jmarsden> hockyhair: If  you think it is one big file, try   find / -size +50000 |xargs ls -lh to see the big files... ?
[03:28] <H3g3m0n> hockyhair: Try the 'disk usage analysis' in Applications>Accessories
[03:28] <cremis> hajiki: that work
[03:28] <hajiki> cremis: yep
[03:28] <hockyhair> H3g3m0n: what is the cmd for that tool
[03:28] <sn4kebyte> evening
[03:28] <eep> how can i get ubuntu to show file extensions?
[03:28] <craska> anyone know if Fiesty Fawn will include a LUKS option on install?
[03:28] <hockyhair> i dont use the gnome bar
[03:28] <cremis> good deal then
[03:28] <bimberi> eep: it does
[03:29] <noelferreira> i guess i need a fresh install jmarsden
[03:29] <denver> is there a package with all the man pages for glibc functions?
[03:29] <eep> no
[03:29] <eep> it doesn't
[03:29] <hou5ton> what on earth have i done to no longer be able to access my cdrom?  The eject function works, but I can't see what is on the CD ..... like it won't let me mount it?
[03:29] <jmarsden> noelferreira: Paste the output to pastebin and then someone can perhaps help you with it?
[03:29] <eep> i just made a text file and tried saving it as blah.txt
[03:29] <hajiki> thanks man... thank you very much
[03:29] <eep> but it isn't really a plain text file
[03:29] <w3ccv> eep:  Linux (all unices) don't havew "extensions" like DOS does
[03:29] <eep> it's an rtf
[03:29] <eep> oh
[03:29] <CharlieSu> Anyone know how to copy a CD into an ISO in Ubuntu
[03:29] <cremis> no prob
[03:29] <eep> then what do i do to change the file type
[03:29] <noelferreira> if i download a new iso it comes with the last kernel jmarsden?
[03:30] <hajiki> w00t it worked!
[03:30] <H3g3m0n> hockyhair: Carn't check unfortunatly, my gnomes dead
[03:30] <cremis> sweet
[03:30] <noelferreira> or the one from when the distro came out?
[03:30] <jmarsden> noelferreira: The latest ISO comes with the kernel for Ubuntu current when that ISO was finalized...
[03:30] <H3g3m0n> hockyhair: nm its 'baobab'
[03:30] <w3ccv> eep: the only way to change the file type is to change the file.
[03:30] <eep> what text editor should i use if i want to make plain text files
[03:30] <noelferreira> ya ok
[03:30] <hockyhair> H3g3m0n: tyvm
[03:30] <w3ccv> eep, use vo
[03:30] <eep> vo?
[03:30] <noelferreira> so a new download won't help me
[03:30] <w3ccv> eep, use vi  corrected
[03:30] <bimberi> eep:  what did you use?
[03:30] <noelferreira> i had problems with edgy
[03:30] <eep> where can i find vi
[03:30] <Zer0Her0> hey is there an easy way to test a HID device?
[03:31] <Zer0Her0> specifically a controller
[03:31] <w3ccv> on the command line
[03:31] <eep> bim i used the text editor that comes with ubuntu. it saves as rtf
[03:31] <noelferreira> so i returned to dapper jmarsden
[03:31] <cafuego> /usr/bin/vi
[03:31] <eep> alright thanks
[03:31] <bimberi> eep: Ubuntu comes with a number of editors, do you mean gedit?
[03:31] <eep> yes gedit
[03:31] <jmarsden> noelferreira: Edgy is fine here... but OK, Dapper should be fine too...
[03:32] <craska> is there anything similar to edit.com like the one found in DOS?
[03:32] <noelferreira> i had problem with rt61 wireless driver jmarsden
[03:32] <noelferreira> it worked just for a while
[03:32] <eep> alright i don't have vi
[03:32] <eep> how can i get it?
[03:32] <noelferreira> i tried amd64 and it seems to be fine
[03:32] <w3ccv> craska:  No, there many lots better, vi, vim, emacs
[03:32] <ubuntu> anyone know the command used by the installer to install the preseed ?
[03:33] <ubuntu> or any way to find that info on the live CD ?
[03:33] <jmarsden> eep: vim.tiny is a part of every Ubuntu install.  Try     sudo apt-get install vim if you want
[03:33] <w3ccv> eep,  look for vim - a vi clone
[03:33] <craska> anything that's not like Nano.  I hate Nano :)
[03:33] <Brunellus> vim.
[03:33] <eep> alright apparently it's already on here
[03:33] <craska> I'll give vim a whirl
[03:33] <eep> i think
[03:34] <Brunellus> vim is awesome.  but it is a steep learning curve
[03:34] <CharlieSu> How can I create a CD image file (iso image)
[03:34] <ubuntu> looking for a way to manually install the base system from the live CD       anyone ?     (not a newbee)
[03:34] <Brunellus> CharlieSu, mkisofs
[03:34] <jmarsden> craska: The two big names in Text editors in the Unix world arfe vi (vim) and Emacs.  Try both and use whichever you prefer.
[03:34] <eep> what i'm just looking for a plain text editor
[03:34] <CharlieSu> Brunellus: from the CD..  I have a CD in my drive I want to copy
[03:34] <w3ccv> eep: they both are,  they are not word processors
[03:34] <Brunellus> ubuntu:  must it be a livecd?  do you have access to an alternative CD? if so, just hit a server install.
[03:34] <hou5ton> Can someone please help me try to figure out why I've apparantly lost access to my CDROM?
[03:35] <ubuntu> Brunellus: no.   dialup
[03:35] <AlbinoRhino> CharlieSu I use Imgburn
[03:35] <Brunellus> h'mm.
[03:35] <ubuntu> CharlieSu: dd
[03:35] <eep> whoah
[03:35] <eep> i don't understand this vim program at all
[03:36] <bimberi> eep: try nano then
[03:36] <CharlieSu> ubuntu: i tried dd.  Didn't work
[03:36] <jmarsden> eep: then hit   :q!    to get out of it.
[03:36] <ubuntu> !work | CharlieSu
[03:36] <ubotu> CharlieSu: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[03:36] <eep> i exited it
[03:36] <nalioth> d3cod3: the java in the repos is the one you want.  use synaptic to install sunjava5-jre
[03:36] <CharlieSu> ubuntu: i did this dd if=/dev/cdrom of=file.iso bs=1024
[03:36] <eep> how do you select all the text then delete it
[03:37] <eep> because neither of them are doing that
[03:37] <nalioth> d3cod3: you should never need to download ANYthing to install.
[03:38] <craska> anyone know if Fiesty Fawn will include a LUKS option on install?
=== Pichu0102 is now known as AL_GORE
[03:38] <eep> yeah
=== AL_GORE is now known as DanielM
[03:38] <d3cod3> i keep geting this
[03:38] <d3cod3> OOPS, you don't seem to have a valid JRE. FrostWire works best with Sun JRE available at http://www.java.com
[03:38] <eep> these text editors are cutting alot of stuff i'm pasting off
[03:38] <CharlieSu> ubuntu: is that the right syntax?
=== DanielM is now known as Pichu0102
[03:38] <ubuntu> nalioth: you wouldn't off hand know the command to install the preceed or how to find that info ?
[03:38] <nalioth> !tell d3cod3 about java
[03:38] <eep> besides gedit, which i can't figure out how to save files as plain text using
[03:39] <ubuntu> CharlieSu: block size might be wrong for an iso.
[03:39] <craska> I had issues with FrostWire.  Wouldn't connect.
[03:39] <nalioth> ubuntu: know what?
[03:39] <craska> I gave up and went with Limewire :)
[03:39] <CharlieSu> ubuntu: When I do mount /dev/cdrom i don't see any files in /media/cdrom
[03:40] <ubuntu> nalioth: i need to install the pre-seed from the live CD   i know it's a single command but have no idea where to look.
[03:40] <nalioth> ubuntu: i have no idea what that is
[03:40] <d3cod3> it doesnt show any packages in my synaptic
[03:40] <CharlieSu> ubuntu: it is my Battle Field 2 CD. I'm trying to make an image of it so that I can mount it with Daemon tools in windows for fast loading of levels..
[03:40] <nalioth> !tell d3cod3 about repos
[03:40] <ubuntu> CharlieSu: audio cd's are not mounted...  if that's what it is.
[03:40] <nalioth> d3cod3: enable the universe and multiverse repos
[03:40] <jmarsden> CharlieSu: Are you sure it is an ordinary, standard CD ?
[03:40] <eddie> hi
[03:41] <bimberi> CharlieSu: does 'df' show it as mounted? if so, is /media/cdrom the mountpoint?
[03:41] <eddie> help
[03:41] <ubuntu> CharlieSu: oh.
[03:41] <d3cod3> how do i do that?
[03:41] <kitche> CharlieSU: it actually doesn;t matter if you make an image or not since the maps are on your computer not the cd
[03:41] <eep> alright, are there any non-terminal based plain text editors?
[03:41] <CharlieSu> /dev/hdd              700M  700M     0 100% /media/cdrom0
[03:41] <craska> gedit
[03:41] <eddie> I have 40 instances of firefox runnign and more opening... I just wanna get rid of
[03:41] <eep> how do you save files as plain text with gedit
[03:41] <grant> Hello mates, does anyone know how to disable the "ubuntu" auto login on the live CD? (I installed the live cd to my HDD and have a different user I want to use)
[03:41] <eep> it just saves ars rtf
[03:41] <eddie> 44 counting
[03:41] <craska> just put a .txt extention
[03:41] <jbroome> eddie: that's not right
[03:41] <eddie> what's the apt-get wayt to get rid og
[03:42] <jmarsden> eep: Emacs works either way, terminal based or GUI, but it is not really intended for beginners unwilling to learn it.
[03:42] <ubuntu> CharlieSu: dd if=/dev/hdd of=file.iso   should  do it.
[03:42] <eddie> jbroome: 50 now
[03:42] <eddie> 56
[03:42] <Shhukk> np: HIM  For You (Acoustic Version) [1:01/4:09]

[03:44] <grandmaster_S> jmarsden, i can  ping 4.2.2.1 but i cannot add a line to resolv.comf
[03:45] <jbroome> even with sudo?
[03:45] <motin_> Madpilot: nothing there on php 5.2.0
[03:45] <grandmaster_S> how does it work with sudo
[03:45] <motin_> anyone else?
[03:45] <eep> w3 i did save as

[03:46] <grandmaster_S> and the line, was it nameserve or nameserver ?
[03:46] <motin_> Madpilot: yes - the widely available versions are 5.1.2 for dapper, 5.1.6 for edgy
[03:46] <motin_> Madpilot: But I need the latest: 5.2.0
[03:46] <jbroome> nameserver
[03:47] <grandmaster_S> thx
[03:47] <Madpilot> motin_, ah, OK. Never bothered getting bleeding-edge PHP running, not sure how to go about it...
[03:47] <motin_> Madpilot: it got stable for about a month ago - not wanting to wait before the ubuntu team believes it is stable "enough" :)
[03:48] <mwhite> Hello everyone
[03:48] <blanky> NOOO IM SO PISSED
[03:48] <Madpilot> motin_, Ubuntu's packages are only updated at release of a new version of Ubuntu, so Edgy won't ever have 5.2, no matter how stable it is.
[03:48] <mwhite> is this the support chat room?
[03:48] <blanky> I forgot the pass to my old pc which I haven't used since june, it's running 6.06 xubuntu server mode :'(
[03:49] <dogfood2006> Boot from livecd blanky
[03:49] <ArrenLex> mwhite: So says the channel topic =P
[03:49] <blanky> dogfood2006: and do what, haha
[03:49] <mwhite> ;)
[03:49] <mwhite> how do I set an environment variable.. ie JAVA_HOME
[03:49] <bimberi> blanky: or boot into recovery mode, get a root shell, and change the password - 'passwd <username>'
[03:49] <dogfood2006> +1 bimberi
[03:49] <ArrenLex> !password > blanky
[03:50] <motin_> Madpilot: so it is impossible you say? to install from the repos?
[03:50] <motin_> on dapper...
[03:50] <blanky> bimberi: how can I boot into recovery mode
[03:50] <rBlong2us> hi
[03:50] <dogfood2006> I'm trying to find the doggone .bin file for my wrt54gl on ddwrt, can someone help
[03:50] <bimberi> blanky: it's an option on the grub boot menu
[03:50] <Madpilot> motin_, far as I know, yes. It won't be in the official repos, certainly
[03:50] <rBlong2us> how can I uninstall firefox the apt-get way?
[03:50] <w3ccv> mwhite, JAVA_HOME=/dir/dir/dir; export JAVA_HOME
[03:50] <blanky> bimberi: ooo thanks :)
[03:50] <bimberi> blanky: np :)

[03:51] <kitche> ah remove :(
[03:51] <kitche> Simei: what slash you just press \ /
[03:51] <motin_> Madpilot: hmm ok - but hey - is it maybe possible to download deb-src and replace the source-tree with the one from 5.2.0 ? heard something similar worked with another app
[03:51] <Simei> _ /
[03:51] <Simei> this one
[03:51] <kitche> Simei: I see _/ you just press those keys
[03:52] <Simei> but they doesent work on console in the 6.10
[03:52] <raplhu88> is there a server release for ubuntu 6.10?
[03:52] <eep> so is there any way to get gedit or mousepad to save as a plain text file?
[03:52] <meheren> my computer doesn't have shutdown options any ideas? when i click system -> Quit it only has log off switch user hibernate and sleep
[03:52] <foomonkey> was support for "audioscrobbler" removed from rhythmbox? I've got it in the preferences dialog in version 0.9.3 but not in 0.9.6
[03:52] <blanky> bimberi: I'm screwed, I forgot my username too, but at least now I have more of a possibility of remembering :D
[03:53] <foomonkey> or perhaps I installed something on the one and forgot to do it on the other
[03:53] <kitche> blanky: you can find that by looking at /etc/passwd
[03:53] <eXcentra> foomonkey, go to edit > plugins
[03:53] <ArrenLex> eep: they DO save as plain text files.
[03:53] <w3ccv> eep: I don't know what you're doing ot gedit - it only saves to text here.
[03:53] <bimberi> blanky: or 'ls /home' - there will be a directory with the same name as the user

[03:53] <blanky> and the change password is passwd <username> right?
[03:53] <eep> w3ccv:  when i save a file using gedit, it saves as an rtf file
[03:53] <foomonkey> eXcentra, thanks!
[03:53] <s|k> does Xubuntu have screensavers?
[03:53] <blanky> thanks kitche too
[03:53] <eep> i'm not doing anything at all
[03:53] <bimberi> blanky: yes
[03:53] <rBlong2us> unfortunately I just uninstalled firefox therefore I can't see the instructions of the latest uninstall
[03:53] <blanky> thanks!
[03:53] <dogfood2006> Ok looks like CFE.bin is the firmware file for wrt54gl
[03:53] <jmarsden> eep: mousepad saves to text files by default, and I think gedit does too...
[03:54] <grandmaster_S> jmarsden, it works
[03:54] <grandmaster_S> thank you
[03:54] <eep> jmarsden:  both mousepad and gedit as saving as rtf files. i haven't changed anything
[03:54] <rBlong2us> with 6.10 would it make the job just apt-get install firefox?
[03:54] <rBlong2us> can that make a difference?
[03:54] <meheren> my computer doesn't have shutdown options any ideas? when i click system -> Quit it only has log off switch user hibernate and sleep
[03:54] <blanky> I REMEMBER NOW! AFTER DOING LS /HOME, I CALLED IT UBOTU I FORGOT!
[03:54] <raplhu88> how do u install LAMP on ubuntu 6.10?
[03:54] <blanky> lol, and I was in this channel too, how could I forget, I wub you ubotu!
[03:54] <blanky> !lamp raplhu88
[03:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lamp raplhu88 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:54] <jmarsden> grandmaster_S: You're welcome.  There is more you really should do to fix the router, but at least it is working well enough to be usable now.
[03:54] <blanky> !LAMP
[03:54] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.

[03:55] <baconbacon> I have a process apt-index-watch that goes crazy every other second, for about one second. What is it and how can i stop it?
[03:55] <bimberi> blanky: lol (take care with those caps though)
[03:55] <w3ccv> eep: what do you mean by RTF file?
[03:55] <ArrenLex> BrightEyes: apt-get install kicker
[03:55] <cello_rasp> is gzip supposed to automatically archive stuff? i just noticed it zipping up some stuff on its own and im rather surprised
[03:55] <blanky> kay :)
[03:55] <ArrenLex> BrightEyes: And then run kicker.
[03:55] <baconbacon> !package apt-index-watch
[03:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about package apt-index-watch - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:55] <ArrenLex> cello_rasp: uh, no?
[03:55] <eep> w3ccv:  it's mime type is application/rtf
[03:55] <mwhite> sweet. I set JAVA_HOME thank you
[03:55] <eep> rich text file
[03:55] <eep> i think
[03:55] <BrightEyes`> ArrenLex: Im using suse :p
[03:56] <cello_rasp> ArrenLex: just gained 2Gb after gzip ran with root. For no noticeable reason.
[03:56] <meheren> does anyone know why my computer doesn't want to shutdown?
[03:56] <grandmaster_S> but now my bigger problem. i have got a newer wlan card from intel (Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG WLAN (802.11a/b/g) ) and cannot install. what to do=
[03:56] <bobbie__4> Your computer maybe manic
[03:56] <ArrenLex> BrightEyes: Then why are you on the ubuntu channel?
[03:56] <jmarsden> eep: so you open Mousepad, type in a work, say "junk" and save the file as a file named junk.txt  Then you claim it really saved as RTF??
[03:56] <w3ccv> eep: how do you know it's mime type - use list (filename) and see what it is
[03:56] <eep> jmarsden: yes exactly
[03:57] <eep> w3ccv: i looked at the properties of the file
[03:57] <meisam> hi guys, does anybody know how to install IBM DB2 DBMS on ubuntu? (i really need it)
[03:57] <jmarsden> eep: what does file junk.txt say (in a terminal window)
[03:57] <w3ccv> eep: what with
[03:57] <ArrenLex> eep: translation: what does the command "file junk.txt" say?
[03:57] <eep> oh wait saving it as .txt worked
[03:57] <[Nige] > i tried installing dvdrip from automatix2 but i still have the same problem
[03:58] <LjL> !automatix | [Nige] 
[03:58] <ubotu> [Nige] : automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[03:58] <eep> i was saving it with a different extension so it just saved it as rtf
[03:58] <eep> that's kind of annoying
[03:58] <flummoxd> !worksforme
[03:58] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:58] <meheren> my computer doesn't have shutdown options any ideas? when i click system -> Quit it only has log off switch user hibernate and sleep
[03:59] <[Nige] > LjL, this is a fresh copy of ubuntu, and i have the same problems I had without automatix
[03:59] <eep> actually no
[03:59] <eep> even if i save it as .txt it still saves it as an rtf file
[04:00] <ArrenLex> eep: what does the command "file junk.txt" say?
[04:00] <jmarsden> ArrenLex: That's what I asked him a while ago...
[04:00] <motin_> Madpilot: I think I have found a way now: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=268687
[04:00] <ArrenLex> jmarsden: yes, I know.
[04:00] <eep> ArrenLex:  set.txt: Rich Text Format data, version 1, Apple Macintosh
[04:01] <ArrenLex> ... o____o
[04:01] <ArrenLex> eep: and file -> save does not provide options for changing the filetype?
[04:01] <eep> ArrenLex: no
[04:02] <w3ccv> eep: are you using Ubunto (or any other linux) or OsX
[04:02] <eep> i'm using ubuntu
[04:02] <hajiki> hey just one more question... can i put transmission in the applications menu?? can you tell me how?
[04:02] <eep> actually wait. i just noticed something in what i was trying to save
[04:03] <eep> it has this line.. is it related? {\rtf1\mac\ansicpg10000\cocoartf102
[04:03] <eep> that's the first line
[04:03] <tx22> hi guys, currently I am on a windows machine trying to work out what the best code to program with. I want to learning a program language which is cross platform between windows and linux.. What's the easiest and best code to learn?
[04:03] <ArrenLex> That would do it.
[04:03] <bimberi> eep: very :)
[04:03] <eep> oh wait yeah. why didn't i notice this
[04:03] <eep> it's supposed to be rtf. oops
[04:03] <ArrenLex> tx22: That's very subjective... "easiest" is probably Java, "most used\most effective\most powerful" is c\c++
[04:04] <eep> well thanks for trying guys. sorry :1
[04:04] <rBlong2us> lovely Your system was affected by this bug: https://launchpad.net/bugs/30791
[04:04] <rBlong2us> that was what was restarting ff a thousand millions times
[04:04] <eep> i've never seen that sort of thing before. that's pretty cool
[04:04] <flummoxd> tx22: you might want to look into python, if you've never programmed before
[04:04] <tx22> ArrenLex:  I know that c is a bit too heavy from what I've heard, isn't python the easiest?
[04:04] <w3ccv> tx22,  Depends on what your want to do,  Perl, php, C/C++, (the list is endless
[04:04] <tx22> flummoxd:  and with python, where do I begin?.. any good sites?
[04:05] <b_d_p> are the 'open week' irc sessions being logged and hosted somewhere? they're all between 2-8am local time for me
[04:05] <ArrenLex> tx22: Python is pretty easy, yes, if you already have your heard around object orientation. However, as an interpreted language, it's about 20 times slower than C.
[04:05] <Daylighter> hey guys, where are the kde headers located in Ubuntu?
[04:05] <bimberi> tx22: python would be a good choice, but that's just my opinion
[04:05] <Terminus> tx22: it's not about the language, it's about how your solution approaches the problem. in short, any language will do. =)
[04:05] <tx22> w3ccv:  Well, I want to learn how to mkae small applications for use in windows and linux.
[04:05] <ArrenLex> Daylighter: you need to install kdelibs4-dev
[04:05] <Daylighter> I did
[04:05] <Pupeno> Do you know any program particularly well suited to make printed big labels, for advertising. Something like the old print master for DOS ?
[04:06] <ArrenLex> Daylighter: then dpkg -L kdelibs4-dev
[04:06] <ArrenLex> Pupeno: glabels?
[04:06] <Daylighter> or perhaps I didnt
[04:06] <Daylighter> thank you, installing now
[04:06] <suran> I have USB2, using ehci ... but I am still only getting about 2-3 MB/s and my load average is at about 10. How can I make this go quicker ???
[04:07] <czedlitz> i am in the process of replacing a laptop screen with a  new one, but when i plug it in it comes on with a purple haze over the whole screen, when i put the old cracked one back in, that is broke it comes on black as i should be. Any ideas, and could it be incoompatible for some reason ?
[04:07] <grandmaster_S> jmarsden do you know how to install wlan cards, which are not supported by ubuntu?
[04:07] <flummoxd> tx22: there is almost too much information out there, but lots of good beginners tutorials. try http://diveintopython.org/ http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide
[04:07] <w3ccv> tx22, still depends - processing power - C/C++, text manipulation, perl, PHP, python; working with MySQL php, perl. Do you want an interperted language or a compiled? Heavy Math - then Fortran
[04:07] <jmarsden> grandmaster_S: No... I prefer wired networks whenever possible!
[04:08] <blanky> hey guys, I'm in this source tree on my old computer and I'm looking for a specific text file, is there a way to recursively look for every text file?
[04:08] <tx22> w3ccv:  Nope, the program I wish to develop are very small and not scientific. I want these apps for small tasks, for example an alarm...
[04:08] <blanky> maybe something like ls --recursive (such thing?) | grep .txt
[04:09] <jmarsden> blanky: ls -R may be what you want?
[04:09] <blanky> anyone?
[04:09] <allen> moteboard asrock, in dualvideo error in unbutu with ndivia fx2000 card
[04:09] <ArrenLex> blanky: find "*.txt*
[04:09] <tx22> flummoxd:  thanks for the link
[04:09] <blanky> ArrenLex: really? that easy?
[04:09] <russian-dude> can anybody give me a link to the instuction on how to install a C++ compiler? every time i try to install something it says it needs something else//
[04:09] <ArrenLex> Sorry, that's find -name "*.txt"
[04:09] <blanky> -name? is that a flag or something I should supply
[04:09] <ArrenLex> blanky: provided your text files have a .txt extension.
[04:09] <blanky> beucase I don't know the name of the file
[04:09] <jmarsden> ls -R is faster and easier :-)
[04:09] <blanky> ArrenLex: yes they do
=== Arrick is now known as ADCM
[04:09] <blanky> so ls -R | grep .txt

[04:09] <blanky> or fine -name "*.txt"
[04:09] <ArrenLex> blanky: Just go to your folder and type in:   find -name ".txt"
[04:10] <ArrenLex> And press enter
[04:10] <kitche> russian_dude install g++ for a C++ compiler
[04:10] <blanky> ArrenLex: and it'll look within every folder in that folder?

[04:10] <ArrenLex> Ugh
[04:10] <ArrenLex> Yes.

[04:11] <hajiki> how can i make a launcher for transmission???
[04:11] <meisam> guys has anybody worked on IBM DB2 and installing that on ubuntu?
=== ADCM is now known as Arrick
[04:11] <justin_> where are the included images for the desktop located in the file system
[04:11] <russian-dude> !packages
[04:11] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[04:11] <russian-dude> sorry
[04:12] <bimberi> hajiki: on the desktop or in the menus?
[04:12] <hajiki> both

[04:16] <slowz3r> Anyone with network experience willing to help get a newbs antenna up an running ?
[04:16] <justin_> hajiki : is it in your applications menu
[04:16] <ArrenLex> !seen Kingsqueak > dragonfyre13
[04:16] <bimberi> hajiki: so you right-click on an empty desktop and there's no "Create Launcher..." in the context menu (2nd in the list here - Dapper)?
[04:16] <dragonfyre13> ArrenLex, that didn't do anything I can see.
[04:17] <dragonfyre13> ArrenLex, thanks though.
[04:17] <dragonfyre13> ArrenLex, I think
[04:17] <hajiki> justin : here /usr/local/bin/transmission-gtk
[04:17] <slowz3r> Anyone with network experience willing to help get a newbs antenna up an running ?
[04:17] <hajiki> bimberi: oh
[04:17] <dragonfyre13> I'm trying to setup my wireless network. I have it working without wep encryption, but whenever I use a wep key, it doesn't connect.
[04:18] <dragonfyre13> I have a 64 bit wep key for simplicity.
[04:18] <w3ccv> dragonfyre13, same here, good luck getting an answer for 128bit
[04:18] <dragonfyre13> I'm using rt73 drivers.
[04:18] <slowz3r> Anyone with network experience willing to help get a newbs antenna up an running ?
[04:18] <keeganx> How I was wondering what the proper command is to do an upgrade from Dapper to Edgy?
[04:18] <dragonfyre13> w3ccv, it seems everyone uses 128bit.
[04:19] <bimberi> ubotu: tell keeganx about upgrade | via /msg
[04:19] <w3ccv> dragonfyre13, how?
[04:19] <dragonfyre13> keeganx, apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:19] <suran> no one else has slow usb storage issues ?
[04:19] <keeganx> I tried using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade after changing the source.list from dapper to edgy, but the gdm never came up
[04:19] <Frankenstein> nope
[04:19] <keeganx> and it said xserver was broken
[04:19] <dragonfyre13> w3ccv, just put in the 26 character hex code.
[04:20] <dragonfyre13> !distupgrade
[04:20] <bimberi> keeganx: no, the recommeded method is to use the update-manager
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about distupgrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <sysrage> anybody here use sylpheed-claws?
[04:20] <w3ccv> dragonfyre13,  doesn't work here, hmmmm.
[04:20] <dragonfyre13> !dist-upgrade
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dist-upgrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <dragonfyre13> !dist-update
[04:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dist-update - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:20] <hajiki> thanks bimberi
[04:20] <dragonfyre13> hmmm
[04:20] <bimberi> !msg the bot
[04:20] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots - Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[04:20] <slowz3r> Anyone with network experience willing to help get a newbs antenna up an running ?
[04:20] <keeganx> So I change my source list to edgy then go to the update manager and perform it from there?
[04:20] <bimberi> hajiki: yw :)
[04:20] <hajiki> but how do i add it to the menu
[04:20] <dRk_sHd0w> anyone know of a good program to decrypt dvds for linux??
[04:20] <bimberi> keeganx: no, you run the update-manager from your dapper install :/
[04:20] <hajiki> ??
[04:21] <dragonfyre13> keeganx, search the wiki. There is a way that you don't change anything in your sources list.
[04:21] <bimberi> hajiki: right-click on "Applications" and select Edit Menus
[04:21] <caffiendo> I have a Linksys WUSB54Gv2 (WIFI) and instructions for install on Dapper 6.06.  Should they be the same for Edgy?
[04:21] <dragonfyre13> hajiki, just right click on the menu, and edit menus.
[04:21] <keeganx> Alright thanks guys
[04:21] <w3ccv> slowz3r, What's a newbs antenna - doesn't sound like a ubuntu problem
[04:21] <Brunellus> caffiendo, did it not work out of the box?
[04:21] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, yep, should be.
[04:21] <Brunellus> I think the rausb module is in the edgy kernel
[04:21] <blanky> !mp3
[04:21] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:22] <hajiki> but it doesnt appear in the add/remove
[04:22] <bimberi> keeganx: ubotu should have sent you a link to a webpage with details
[04:22] <keeganx> yeah I saw it just right now
[04:22] <dragonfyre13> Brunellus, caffiendo, the rausb that comes with edgy doesn't work.
[04:22] <slowz3r> w3ccv: well i need a driver and i cant realy, nor do i know if there is a driver available for linux
[04:22] <bimberi> hajiki: RIGHT-click on the word Applications
[04:22] <Impetus|Fatkid> hey does anyone know if this is a good distr for a first time user of linux ?
[04:22] <slowz3r> w3ccv: its for a Hawking tech HAI6SDP  usb antenna
[04:22] <caffiendo> Brunellus: I plugged it in once booted, and nothing happened.  I figured it wouldn't auto detect it, should I just reboot?  I've never added new hardware with Linux yet.
[04:22] <hajiki> yeah
[04:22] <dragonfyre13> Impetus|Fatkid, yes, it really is. I love it.
[04:23] <Impetus|Fatkid> can u run games off it
[04:23] <Impetus|Fatkid> like winex
[04:23] <dragonfyre13> !wireless
[04:23] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[04:23] <ubotu> caffiendo: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[04:23] <bimberi> hajiki: there should be no "Add/Remove..." but "Edit Menus" should be in the list that pops up
[04:23] <eXcentra> you know how the ubuntu installer can resize your ntfs partition for you? would you suggest defragging windows first or does it not matter?
[04:23] <hajiki> yeah alacarte menu editor pops up
[04:23] <kitche> Impetus|Fatkid: hope you know that winex doesn't exist they renamed now to cedega
[04:24] <dragonfyre13> hajiki, that's what your looking for.
[04:24] <caffiendo> dragonfyre13: thank you.  new to IRC too.
[04:24] <Impetus|Fatkid> didnt know
[04:24] <hajiki> but i dont see transmission there
[04:24] <caffiendo> !rausb
[04:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rausb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:24] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, no problem.
[04:24] <hajiki> i want to add that app
[04:24] <hajiki> >.>
[04:24] <bimberi> eXcentra: that's a good idea, having good backups is another btw :)
[04:24] <slowz3r> Does anyone if their are any Hawking Tech Drivers for a USB antenna?
[04:24] <bimberi> hajiki: file -> new entry
[04:25] <eXcentra> bimberi, heh. :P but i'm just wondering if defragging is "optional"
[04:25] <Impetus|Fatkid> is it just one cd then
[04:25] <Impetus|Fatkid> coz thats all i can find
[04:25] <bimberi> eXcentra: sure
[04:25] <eXcentra> bimberi, haha, well, that's a straight enough answer. :)
[04:25] <bimberi> eXcentra: it will just maximise the amount of space you can use for Ubuntu
[04:25] <bimberi> eXcentra: :)
[04:25] <hajiki> oh i see thanks bimberi

[04:26] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, that's what I just setup.
[04:26] <slowz3r> Does anyone if their are any Hawking Tech Drivers for a USB antenna?
[04:26] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, email me at dragonfyre13@gmail.com with questions if you need help beyond that.
[04:26] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, if I'm not on later.
[04:27] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, that shows you how to setup that card. That's the chipset for rt73.
[04:27] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, quite likely, that's what your using.
[04:27] <cremis> looking for desktop images filesystem location any help
[04:27] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, does it show wlan and wmaster?
[04:28] <caffiendo> dragonfyre13: much appreciated!
[04:28] <hajiki> thanks guys
[04:28] <hajiki> later
[04:28] <Kaiyang> hi pple may i know for SAMBA... is there a default or standard on which partitions are all the files going to be saved?
[04:28] <main> hello all
[04:28] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, for your network interfaces?
[04:28] <cremis> later hajiki
[04:28] <slowz3r> Does anyone if their are any Hawking Tech Drivers for a USB antenna its an HAI6SDP
[04:28] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, do a ifconfig to find out.
[04:28] <motin_> anyone can give a good link (except for google...) to where to learn about building php from source on ubuntu?
[04:29] <caffiendo> dragonfyre13: i've only checked in device manager and it shws.  I just started the install and wanted 2 c if there was anything special  I'll check config now.
[04:29] <ivx> is anyone else having a lot of problems with 6.10 logging them off and stuff all the time
[04:30] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, I got to go now, but email me at the address I gave you if you have some questions. Plenty of caveats if you don't know what you are doing with an rt73 chipset on linux.
[04:30] <startswithz> hello, I just installed edgy, and I'm really new to linux.  Do I need to recompile the kernel to let it know that I have a centrino chip instead of a 386 or does it know that automatically?
[04:30] <dragonfyre13> startswithz, it knows.
[04:31] <caffiendo> dragonfyre13: thanks. i'll give it a try and see whathappens.  thanks for the support!
[04:31] <dragonfyre13> startswithz, actually, you should have the linux-image-generic kernel, which enables everything you'll need.
[04:31] <main> should pick the correct chipset upon install
[04:31] <slowz3r> Does anyone have a Hawking Tech device installed on their linux here????
[04:31] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, no problem. I like to help out where I can, and I'll write a howto soon on the boards.
[04:32] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, be sure to email me if you have questions. very few people have the information to get it up and running correctly.
[04:32] <main> CHecked the Hawkin Website?
[04:32] <Kaiyang> sorry anyone available to help with:  SAMBA... is there a default or standard on which partitions are all the files going to be saved?
[04:32] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, I still don't have wep working, but that should be fairly painless. The hard part (driver installation) is behind me.
[04:33] <tcli> Kaiyang: Can you elaborate on that a little?
[04:33] <dragonfyre13> caffiendo, also note, you can't use network manager to manage the connection. Connection manager (grab it from the forums) works with the rt73 chipset though.
[04:33] <dragonfyre13> by all.
[04:33] <caffiendo> dragonfyre13: peace
[04:33] <main> bye...
[04:34] <dragonfyre13> So long, and thanks for all the fish. ^_^
[04:34] <dogfood2006> W00T!  I just flashed my wrt54GL firmware with ddwrt
[04:34] <Music_Shuffle> Bye.
[04:34] <stasislove> hi, i try to hack my mouse to work properly from a how to, but xorg complains about "no evdev", no apperent evdev in synaptic to download, can anyone help?
[04:34] <dogfood2006> I'm running the ddwrt firmware, I'd officially like to say that it's great. Everyone should switch if they haven't already
[04:34] <dogfood2006> Now I just need to make sure it's going to play nice with Comcast, those bastards might have me register the router's mac address or something
=== Celldweller is now known as CyberShadow
[04:34] <Kaiyang> tcli>	for example files in html files for apache are stored in /var/www .... where does SAMBA files stored? I believe that is a common standard...
[04:35] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, you can clone the mac is needbe.
=== CyberShadow is now known as Celldweller
[04:35] <dogfood2006> Ah, great idea, maybe I should do that regardless
[04:36] <faolan> how is everyone?
[04:36] <dogfood2006> So apparently, now that my trouter has 16 MB of RAM, I could conceivably run a webserver on my ROUTER without ever having to turn any pc on! How awesome is that
[04:36] <bimberi> Kaiyang: no, there's no default location for samba shares
[04:36] <dogfood2006> I get to it by either ssh'ing to it or by 192.168.1.1:81
[04:36] <baconbacon> Kaiyang: you must setup shares, there is no default share location
[04:37] <baconbacon> heh
[04:37] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, how'd you get 16mb in it
[04:37] <bimberi> baconbacon: :)
[04:37] <dogfood2006> The wrt54GL router comes w/ 16mb of ram
[04:37] <Kaiyang> i see. may know what is the purpose of /var/?
[04:38] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, ah, I only have a wrt54gs.  gotta upgrade
[04:38] <baconbacon> Kaiyang:  I always supposed it was for directories which may contain variable amounts of user content
[04:38] <startswithz> when I boot linux it seems to take longer than xp did is there something that I need ot modify to speed the process up?
[04:38] <Tonren> Hay guys, can someone help me fix unionfs in Edgy?  This is the information on the problem: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297644
[04:39] <dogfood2006> All you have to do is grab the binary firmware file from ddwrt.com, which in my case was called dd-wrt.v23_mini_wrt54g.bin, log into the router through your ethernet cable and flash that bad boy
[04:39] <baconbacon> Kaiyang: so if /var/ is on a separate partition and gets full, the system can still boot correctly
[04:39] <w3ccv> startswithz, all unices take a while, especially if it has to fsck file systems
[04:39] <elite> hey
[04:39] <dogfood2006> If you already have firmware running on the router, which if you bought it shrinkwrapped it does, you need to use that flie
[04:39] <startswithz> fsck?
[04:39] <elite> how do I get video decoders installed such as divx or mp3 codecs?
[04:39] <baconbacon> fsck ~= chkdsk
[04:40] <dogfood2006> If you screwed up and unbricked your router, you have to use another binary, which you can get off the ddwrt website, the wiki tells you everything, didnt take that long
[04:40] <bimberi> ubotu: tell elite about restrictedformats | via /msg
[04:40] <zipzo> Hi, i need help t find out if i can put a windows xp dual boot onto a ubuntu only system
[04:40] <Kaiyang> if i am running a linux server... how shd i partition my HardDisk? where shd i upload all my files into? so that it will not slow down the server system?
[04:41] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: Anyway, I now need to pair that guy with my actual cable modem. I might have to clone the mac address, but hopefully not
[04:41] <Kornflake46703> hey should my wireless logitech  stuff work in 610
[04:42] <dogfood2006> I don't have much experience with getting the radius authenticatoin going, but I think wpa2 aes/tkip with ssid broadcasting disabled should be enough to ward off my neighbors here in the heart of silicon valley
[04:43] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, or unplug it for a few minutes to let the cable co's arp cache timeout.
[04:43] <zipzo> does anyone know if i can put windows back onto my linux install or do i have to wipe it all and put windows on first?
[04:43] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, do you have any experience with getting 128bit WEP working with Edgy
[04:44] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: unplug the cable modem you mean? can you explain to me why that's necessary?
[04:44] <dogfood2006> what is an arp cache and why would I need to clear it out?
[04:44] <madmancanuck> can anybody tell me how I would set it so that any subdirectories of a directory keep the same group?
[04:44] <bruenig> zipzo, it is easier to do windows first. If you do it afterwards, it generally wipes out grub but there are ways to get grub back, see following factoid
[04:44] <bruenig> !grub
[04:44] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[04:44] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, between the cable modem and your router.  The ARP cache is the mac address/IP accress table.
[04:45] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, address table   **correction
[04:45] <baconbacon> Kaiyang: ideally if users can write content to e.g samba shares, the shares should be on /var/*(whatever)*, and /var on a separate partition. /tmp should have its partition also. That's the classic unix layout afaik
[04:45] <Tonren> Hay guys, can someone help me fix unionfs in Edgy?  This is the information on the problem: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297644
[04:45] <stasislove> hi i need evdev to configure the mouse, any clue anyone?
[04:46] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: I do not, but why are you using wep?
[04:46] <bruenig> !info xserver-xorg-input-evdev

[04:46] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, network device only talk to either by MAC addrss, not IP. ARPing = "Who answers to the IP address 1.2.3.4?"
[04:46] <zipzo> is there any way or need to defragment the hard disk in ubuntu?
[04:46] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: Your router should support wpa or wpa2 shared key authentication
[04:46] <phreakuency> hey all
[04:47] <bruenig> stasislove, sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-evdev, if you didn't catch that factoid
[04:47] <dogfood2006> zipzo: you don't really need to defragment if you're using ext3 as a filesystem
[04:47] <stasislove> bruenig, thanks
[04:47] <phreakuency> anyone here use beryl?
[04:47] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, it does WPA but not all laptops do.
[04:47] <dogfood2006> the days of defragmentation are left behind on ntfs and fat32 filesystem, though some of my friends do disagree with me on that
[04:47] <bruenig> phreakuency, #ubuntu-xgl
[04:47] <madmancanuck> does anybody know if there is a way that you can set a subdirectory so that any new directories or files below it maintain the same group?
[04:47] <phreakuency> I did
[04:47] <phreakuency> they didnt have an answer for me
[04:48] <Kornflake46703> hey should my wireless logitech  stuff work in 6.10
[04:48] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: I presume you just have to install the right package and get a wpa client for ubuntu, are you saying your NIC does not support WPA?
[04:48] <bruenig> madmancanuck, if I understand your question, you can chown recursively which I would think would do that.
[04:48] <stasislove> bruenig, hm got it installed, but when i change in xorg to evdev it says no evdev o.0
[04:49] <bruenig> stasislove, yeah, I don't know how to do that. I just found the package, figured you could do the rest
[04:49] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, w2k does not have WPA
[04:49] <madmancanuck> bruenig:  I've tried that but everytime somebody adds a new file, it sets the group for that file or directory to their own name
[04:49] <madmancanuck> on a CVS server this causes nothing but trouble
[04:49] <dope> has anyone got the wireless to work on an averatec laptop?
[04:50] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: you're using w2k? you can probably get a third party wpa client that does though
[04:50] <mkay_> madmancanuck, you can try to set the SGID bit on the directory
[04:50] <stasislove> bruenig, allright, ill try modprobe, have no other ideas =\
[04:50] <w3ccv> dogfood2006, besides that, my question is how to get WEP 128 to work!
[04:50] <madmancanuck> how do I do that?
[04:51] <startswithz> w3ccv, I use wifi radar
[04:51] <mkay_> chmod g+s dir
[04:51] <bruenig> !wifi
[04:51] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[04:53] <madmancanuck> mkay_:  I tried the chmod on the parent directory, but when I create a subdirectory in there, it still allows me to set my own group

[04:54] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: Have you tried using iwconfig ?
[04:54] <method|> I just bought a new seagate harddrive. how do I format it and stuff?
[04:54] <dogfood2006> It sets the network name, encryption, transmission rate, and other config settings
[04:54] <bruenig> method|, gparted
[04:54] <Chu> bruenig: No, this is some font I've found on the internet.
[04:55] <Vaske_Car> how to setup Konqueror to use flash plugin?
[04:55] <bruenig> Chu, you could probably watch that installer and see what it does. or download its source as I assume it is just some script and then see what it does
[04:55] <dogfood2006> w3ccv: man iwconfig while I look it up in my ubuntu cookbook
[04:56] <bimberi> Vaske_Car: try #kubuntu (if no-one here knows)

[04:56] <bruenig> method|, it is, sudo apt-get install gparted

[04:59] <bruenig> kelly_, do mp3's work on other media players?

[04:59] <cremis> slowz3r:  automatix2 can be used to install ndiswrapper

[04:59] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[04:59] <kelly_> bruenig no they dont only problem i have now
[04:59] <slowz3r> cremis: im nub where can i find automatix2
[04:59] <dogfood2006> Kornflake46703: probably not, you probably need to install the drivers as modules.
[05:00] <orphean> boy there's some fud

[05:00] <mumrah> during the install, when it's "creating ext3 file system for / partition" it gets to 8% or so and then slows to a halt
[05:00] <slowz3r> ivx: its not a card its a external hawkingtech wirless usb antenna
[05:00] <dogfood2006> I would do some research on the internet to see if other people are in the same boat as you are an pursue that avenue
[05:00] <mumrah> it's a sata hdd
[05:00] <bruenig> slowz3r, if you enjoy the sanity of your system, you will not install automatix. Although you could get past it unscathed. Your call
[05:00] <dogfood2006> The likelihood that someone else in here is using hte same mouse as you are is probably pretty slim
[05:00] <kelly_> How do i fix it?
[05:00] <Narrchy> how do i give myself permission to access a file
[05:00] <kelly_> need a quick fix please
[05:00] <bruenig> kelly_, that seems to indicate you didn't install the right stuff
[05:00] <ivx> slowz3r okay i don't know about that sry
[05:01] <slowz3r> bruenig: what would you suggest
[05:01] <kelly_> bruenig i tried everything already
[05:01] <Kornflake46703> how?
[05:01] <dogfood2006> Narrchy, you'll need to change the ownership of that flie
[05:01] <dogfood2006> Narrchy: man chown
[05:01] <Narrchy> properties tab or something?
[05:01] <dogfood2006> No, do it using the command line, it'll be easier
[05:01] <bruenig> kelly_, "Open Amarok and play an mp3 file. Amarok will ask if you would like to add mp3 support and then install the libxine-extracodecs package."
[05:01] <Narrchy> what should i type
[05:02] <Ae01> Hi, everybody
[05:02] <Ae01> I want to know about Build-essential on Ubuntu
[05:02] <dogfood2006> Where is this file? What is the file?
[05:02] <cremis> slowz3r: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=54847
[05:02] <kelly_> bruenig no it doesn't
[05:03] <bruenig> Ae01, it installs all the things necessary for the compilation of software
[05:03] <Narrchy> it is sources.list
[05:03] <bruenig> kelly_, sudo apt-get install libxine-extracodecs
[05:03] <dogfood2006> Theres' probably a good reason that the file is not giving you access, it's probably owned by the system
[05:03] <kelly_> bruenig just flies through the song without playing
[05:03] <Ae01> brueing , I want to compile a tuxpaint
[05:03] <bruenig> Ae01, install build-essential, sudo apt-get install build-essential, and then compile away
[05:03] <zipzo> if i need toget windows back on this ubuntu box, might it not be easier to get a new hard drive and install windows from that?
[05:04] <dogfood2006> But if you need to change the permission of a file, type sudo chown 700 [yourusername]  [filename] 
[05:04] <bruenig> Ae01, or if you want to be real cool just do sudo apt-get install tuxpaint and it will download and install it for you
[05:04] <mumrah> i'm trying to install 6.10 on a SATA drive, and during the installation, it essentially stops after 8% of creating the ext3 file system

[05:08] <zipzo> i hate to even bother to put windows back on, but sadly CAD on linux is not up to speed
[05:08] <kitche> Tonren: I m not sure if the ubuntu kernel has unionfs support the kernelt hat gets isntalled that is
[05:08] <gnutun> hey all; i want to install the most recent version of a package (python-lxml) but i'm on an old version of ubuntu (breezy); is there a way i can do this with apt-get?
[05:09] <Tonren> kitche: Huh.  Well, it worked fine before.
[05:09] <zipzo> so i ask agian, if i need toget windows back on this ubuntu box, might it not be easier to get a new hard drive and install windows from that?
[05:09] <gimmulf_> Good software for companies to keep track of everything like taxes, expenses etc.
[05:09] <gimmulf_> ?
[05:09] <Jager> Hey
[05:09] <bruenig> bigfuzzyjesus, depending on what exactly you want there are some better alternatives. For instance, I only used the system gauges until I found conky which does the system gauges but at a much lower resource cost
[05:09] <Jager> Hello
[05:10] <pchero> hello
[05:10] <foo> Does knoppix or ubuntu livecd write to ntfs?
[05:10] <bigfuzzyjesus> bruenig, thats all i use too heh
[05:10] <Jager> I reset my fmb so that i could try to boot into windows (it was failing using grub) so now i cant boot into windows or linux >_> is there a way i can install grub using the livedisc???
[05:10] <zipzo> nobody knows? if i need toget windows back on this ubuntu box, might it not be easier to get a new hard drive and install windows from that?
[05:10] <bruenig> bigfuzzyjesus, conky is a bit complex though, took a while to figure it out and how to get it like I want it. There is a howto on the forums that I used, and then you just edit the config file to get whatever gauges you want and how you want them laid out.
[05:11] <bigfuzzyjesus> bruenig, ok
[05:11] <bigfuzzyjesus> bruenig, i will look into it thank you
[05:12] <allen> cierto habia una forma de desactivar el usuario root del sshd?

[05:13] <zipzo> thevenin: i did? i dont see that. i sthat clever?
[05:14] <blanky> under what menu is vino?
[05:14] <Jager> Could someone help me with my problem?
[05:14] <bruenig> zipzo, I told you earlier that if you want to install windows you can do so on the same disk. You will need to replace grub as the mbr will be overwritten. If you want to install it on another disk, I suppose that is a possibility as is wiping the whole disk installing windows then installing ubuntu
[05:15] <zipzo> no that not the question. drive and install windows from that?
[05:15] <zipzo> * Ghost_Printer (n=geek@S0106006067664bde.no.shawcable.net) has left #ubuntu
[05:15] <zipzo> <br
[05:15] <Jager> I reset my fmb so that i could try to boot into windows (it was failing using grub) so now i cant boot into windows or linux >_> is there a way i can install grub using the livedisc???
[05:15] <blanky> !vnc
[05:15] <ubotu> vnc is a way of doing remote desktop.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !freenx.
[05:15] <zipzo> the question was, can i get a new hard disk and install windows on that instead of partitioning.
[05:15] <blanky> !freenx
[05:15] <ubotu> freenx is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
[05:15] <thevenin> you could do it that way, their are many different routes you could take
[05:16] <Jager> zipzo: yes you can... you would just have to configure grub to look for windows on hd1,0 I think
[05:16] <Jager> im probably wrong lol
[05:16] <Jager> Anyways, could someone help me?
[05:16] <bruenig> blanky, vino is command line right? just open a terminal and run "vino"
[05:16] <zipzo> so then i would need to make sure the windows drive was the primary, and the linux was slave or would it not matter?
[05:16] <thevenin> no Jager your correct
[05:16] <blanky> bruenig: it wont work
[05:16] <blanky> bruenig: i only have vino-preferences
[05:16] <Jager> Ah okay] 
[05:16] <Baile1> close enough jager, you could install different OS's on different hard drives but only one drive can be the boot drive
[05:17] <bimberi> Jager: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[05:17] <Jager> thank you bimberio
[05:17] <Jager> bimberi* lol
[05:17] <thevenin> zipzo: it is easier to install windows first if that is an option
[05:17] <bimberi> Jager: no problemo :)
[05:17] <Jager> right right
[05:17] <cremis> slowz3r: i really dont know how to do it, i just googled it
[05:17] <zipzo> its not an option really, since i would loose all of my ubuntu wsetup
[05:17] <Jager> Know what weird?
[05:18] <zipzo> that wasnt your question?
[05:18] <Jager> Before grub was showing my ntfs partition as hd0,0
[05:18] <Jager> but it wouldnt boot windows at that
[05:18] <thevenin> well then ya resize your partitions and install windows then edit your grub to recognize windows
[05:18] <Jager> err. be careful with resizing ntfs..
[05:18] <Jager> i think thats what messed mine up
[05:18] <zipzo> just don use ntfs
[05:18] <zipzo> i think
[05:18] <Jager> Well i had windows on before
[05:19] <zipzo> use the old fat32
[05:19] <Jager> if you plan on installing ubuntu after you already have windows
[05:19] <thevenin> Jager: windows hast to be on either NTFS or fat
[05:19] <Jager> I know
[05:19] <thevenin> ok
[05:19] <Jager> can you change it to fat once its already ntfs?
[05:19] <slowz3r> cremis: alright thanks anyway
[05:19] <thevenin> nope
[05:19] <Jager> k yea
[05:20] <Jager> Because windows xp by default installs ntfs...
[05:20] <slowz3r> Can anyone walk me through installing a windows Wirless adapter driver on linux ? please
[05:20] <thevenin> ya
[05:20] <Baile1> well the newer version of suse has a pretty good thing for resizing ntfs partitions, found it when I was playing with suse, so just find out what it uses and use that or there is always partition magic
[05:20] <thevenin> slowz3r: their are very many guides on that
[05:20] <Jager> !wireless | slowz3r
[05:20] <ubotu> slowz3r: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:20] <PapaLion> Anyone know a wireless card that will work out of the box with a dell inspiron 1100
[05:20] <mkay_> exit
[05:21] <Jager> Hmm.. is there anywa to load the linux kernal without grub?
[05:21] <thevenin> PapaLion: go with an orinoco
[05:21] <slowz3r> thevin: i know but all the guides ive seen were extremely hard to understand
[05:21] <cremis> slowz3r: noprb
[05:21] <PapaLion> thevenin: got a model name? I need to get a pcmcia card.. ive already gotten some that don't work.. and I'm so sad
[05:22] <thevenin> dont mean to be a dick but if you think the guides were hard, you prob wont be able to follow what oyur told here.
[05:22] <Jager> is it possible to connect tot eh internet while using the livedisc?
[05:22] <PapaLion> yes
[05:22] <Jager> :/

[05:22] <thevenin> i dont like dells, sorry man i would say check dells forums for that
[05:22] <thevenin> sorry
[05:22] <Baile1> yeah, windows xp and up will recognize linux and you can use that to boot or reverse and get grub to load an OS, but somewhere something along the way has to load the OS aka pull itself up by the bootstraps to get the OS any OS going
[05:22] <thevenin> had to make a point
[05:23] <PapaLion> yeah.. dells suck :(
[05:23] <bruenig> I just like to say oh my, makes me chuckle
[05:23] <Jager> i went and set my dns servers... and disabled ipv6 while on the live disc

[05:46] <thevenin> ok Narrchy_  copy and paste the repositiories from ubuntuguide.org to your sources.list then do the line under it to add key and then do sudo apt-get update and you will be fine
[05:46] <Baile1> ctrl+c
[05:46] <PMantis> Are there any "gotcha" points for using initramfs-tools in 6.10 ?

[05:57] <blanky> can someone please help me start tightvnc or any other vnc server?
[05:57] <blanky> plleaase :
[05:58] <thevenin> blanky: did you download it,
[05:58] <AsheD> I can no longer play DVDs on my computer :(  It says either I may not have access to the file, or if I try to load it manually, it tells me that /dev/dvd [or wherever it mounts it]  is not a valid DVD drive, and cannot be read
[05:58] <blanky> thevenin: I have realvnc, tightvnc, and vnc tht comes with ubuntu (dnt know which one)
[05:58] <blanky> thevenin: I just don't know how to start it
[05:59] <thevenin> you haft to set ubuntu to allow it
[05:59] <fushidamn> nick Bailey
[05:59] <Tonren> Gahh... why won't unionfs work anymore!!
[05:59] <blanky> thevenin: what?!
[05:59] <thevenin> check ubuntuguide for more details
[05:59] <blanky> thevenin: where is that
[05:59] <blanky> !tightvnc
[05:59] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tightvnc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:59] <thevenin> www.ubuntuguide.org
[06:00] <tcli> blanky: check /etc/init.d... should be an init script in there
[06:00] <tcli> blanky: the client should be vncviewer
[06:00] <fushidamn> testing
[06:00] <blanky> tcli: I want to start a server
[06:00] <Chu> I can't seem to figure out how to add a ttf to my system. I've tried several methods, but it doesn't seem to show up in any font lists. :-/
[06:01] <blanky> tcli: ls /etc/init.d/ | grep vnc
[06:01] <blanky> no go
[06:01] <Madpilot> Tonren, it's gone on strike?
[06:01] <tcli> blanky: Then you want to find the appropriate init script, and /etc/init.d/vncd start or whatever it is
[06:01] <blanky> tcli: but I don't know how to set it up! :'(
[06:02] <tcli> there should also be something in system->administration->services
[06:02] <blanky> tcli: okay, imagine I JUST got the packages, what do I do?
[06:02] <fushidamn> does anyone know why when you run an irc in a terminal it does not show your nick (btw, what is my nick?)
[06:02] <tcli> you should just need to give it a port and password, typically
[06:02] <Chu> Ah, nevermind, I forgot to restart the programs I was trying to use it with. My bad. :p
[06:02] <tcli> i dunno, i've never used vnc on linux, and don't really see the need for it
[06:02] <tcli> exporting x sessions is easier, faster, and more secure
[06:03] <blanky> tcli: give what the port and password, lol
[06:03] <Skwid_> how can i add a language to the gtk spell checking ?
[06:03] <blanky> fushidamn: fushidamn is your nick, heh
[06:03] <thevenin> lol @ tcli
[06:03] <fushidamn> thank you, then I have figured out how to change my nick
[06:03] <tcli> blanky: the vnc server
[06:03] <blanky> tcli: yeah, what is the command?
[06:04] <Tonren> Madpilot: Freakin' non-union filesystems
[06:04] <drew> what is the default mysql pw?
[06:04] <Madpilot> Tonren, heh
[06:04] <aSt3raL_> whats a good way to run a script at sunrise/sunset?
[06:04] <kitche> drew: well there shouldn't be one
[06:04] <aSt3raL_> is there some sort of cron modification?
[06:05] <urmom> how can i get classpath + gcj working in ppc?
[06:05] <fushidamn> have fun people, that is enough testing irc stuff for one night

[06:05] <blanky> tcli: THANKS
[06:06] <tcli> blanky: np :)
[06:06] <dabaR> aSt3raL_: install a solar power panel and connect it to your computer
[06:06] <kitche> drew: should be root
[06:06] <drew> kitche: k, thx
[06:06] <aSt3raL_> dabaR: nice idea but it would have to be a phototransistor of some sort

[06:09] <Skwid_> dabaR: any program using a gtk textbox
[06:09] <dabaR> like...
[06:09] <ubunjusty> Skwid_: Maybe you should look at something like cron?
[06:10] <Skwid_> ubuntulog: huh ???
[06:10] <Skwid_> ubunjusty: it does it by itself
[06:10] <Skwid_> i just want to add another language
[06:10] <dabaR> Skwid_: aptitude search spell
[06:10] <blanky> hey guys anyone know why I'm getting this error? http://paste.jorgepena.be/47
[06:11] <ubunjusty> Skwid_:  cron is a daemon that will run a program at a time you give it.
[06:11] <Skwid_> ubunjusty: i know, but i don't see the relevance here
[06:11] <ubunjusty> Skwid_: Sorry answering someone else's question.
[06:12] <tcli> blanky: looks like you don't have a display variable set... try running: export DISPLAY=":0.0" first

[06:12] <blanky> export Display=":0.0"
[06:12] <tcli> blanky: yeah
[06:12] <malt> Hello, I'm going by the guide on unreal site for IRCD and when i go to run ./Config i get permission denied, wonder why? i have full access
[06:12] <dabaR> blanky: you don't think the command is relevant?
[06:12] <blanky> dabaR: huh?
[06:13] <tcli> blanky: except DISPLAY needs to be in all caps
[06:13] <blanky> tcli: when I type that, nothing happens
[06:13] <blanky> oh, hehe
[06:13] <dabaR> blanky: what command gave you the error?
[06:13] <tcli> blanky: It just sets a variable... shouldn't return anything
[06:13] <blanky> tcli: export DISPLAY=":0.0" gave no results/output
[06:13] <tcli> blanky: it'll just let everything in that terminal session know which display to use
[06:13] <tcli> blanky: try running whatever it was again
[06:13] <blanky> dabaR: when I typed gaim, but it also happened (first, as fasr as I know) when I typed tightvncserver
[06:14] <Lovloss> xgl is very confusing
[06:14] <blanky> but it's not just in that terminal session
[06:14] <malt> nvm
[06:14] <blanky> it happens everywhere
[06:14] <badmacktuck> hey all
[06:14] <Lovloss> i keep getting directed to this suse thing
[06:14] <blanky> when I click on the gaim icon, it loads and loads but then closes
[06:14] <ubunjusty> malt: Maybe you haven't given the ./config file execute permissions or it could have extracted under s different user name.  You can alway ls -l in order to see the owner/permissions
[06:14] <blanky> I typed what you said, bout the export, and i typed gaim and the same thing ahppens
[06:14] <malt> I used it with sudo and it worked good
[06:14] <Lovloss> isnt there just some sort of installation program?
[06:14] <blanky> I'm scared of restarting my pc now
[06:14] <blanky> nothing is launching!
[06:14] <blanky> :'(
[06:15] <blanky> I can't open any new windows/programs
[06:15] <blanky> I'm so scared of restarting lol
[06:15] <dabaR> blanky: log out back in...
[06:15] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Are you trying to install Beryl or something like it on Ubuntu 6.10?
[06:15] <blanky> dabaR: you mean, log out, log back in??
[06:15] <blanky> dabaR: taht's not waht I meant by afraid of restarting
[06:15] <Music_Shuffle> ctrl-alt-bkspce
[06:15] <dabaR> blanky: or stop tightvnc server
[06:15] <edwardsNdallas> anyone ever set up RAID1 on ubuntu LAMP?
[06:15] <blanky> dabaR: what I meant was, I'm scared of turning off my computer
[06:15] <CientificoLoco> hello
[06:15] <blanky> dabaR: how?
[06:15] <Lovloss> I want my edgy eft's gnome interface to be capable of those graphical effects, yes
[06:16] <CientificoLoco> how do I install the last version of amns?
[06:16] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Are you using an ATI or nVidia card?
[06:16] <Music_Shuffle> blanky, log out by hitting ctrl-alt-backspace, closes X sessions and takes you back to the login prompt.
[06:16] <tcli> edwardsNdallas: Using md?
[06:16] <dabaR> blanky: show output of ps aux on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:16] <Lovloss> nvidia... geforce 5200
[06:16] <blanky> okay dabaR
[06:16] <Lovloss> im confused, because i seem to already have xserver-xorg setup. i downloaded the nvidia drivers
[06:17] <edwardsNdallas> md? guess not :(
[06:17] <badmacktuck> so, im trying to install 6.10 on my laptop and its not playing nicely, tried everything i can think of but it seems like the screen just shuts off everything i try
[06:17] <blanky> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34303/
[06:17] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: The 9xxx series driver has native support to use the aiglx support built into Edgy's xorg server.  I would suggest using it to avoid having to download xgl.

[06:17] <rusito> hola donde puedo conseguir VMWARE con serie?
[06:17] <jbroome> vmware serial?
[06:18] <Lovloss> ... using it, okay. So whats the next step then?
[06:18] <blanky> rusito: eso es illegal jaja
[06:18] <blanky> !es | rusito
[06:18] <ubotu> rusito: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[06:18] <rusito> ok, thanks
[06:18] <jbroome> you see everyone in here typing english, you know english and you ask the question in spanish?  wtf
[06:19] <ubunjusty> Lovloss:  So you are using the 9xxx series?  Cool.  All you have to do then is install Beryl or Compiz or something like that and then run it.  You may have to edit a couple of things in order to make it start by default and for it to remember you settings on exit.  But you can head over to the Beryl-project web site to get all the information.
[06:19] <Admiral_Chicago> jbroome: just because they say thanks in english doesn't mean they "know it'
[06:19] <blanky> dabaR: ?
[06:19] <Lovloss> er, okay, how do i know if its a 9xxx series?
[06:20] <aztracker1> learn C in two minutes... it works too... http://tinyurl.com/ygjept
[06:20] <tcli> aztracker1: lol
[06:20] <aztracker1> saw it on my bbs..
[06:20] <badmacktuck> anyone going to be able to help me?
[06:20] <aztracker1> tcli, thought it was funny.
[06:21] <blanky> dabaR: I think I know what's wrong now but would you be nice enough to follow along
[06:21] <blanky> dabaR: ? please ?
[06:21] <blanky> dabaR: I can't fix this alone
[06:21] <dabaR> blanky: kill -9 4228 5592 5096 5428 3656
[06:21] <blanky> sudo?
[06:21] <blanky> dabaR: it says no such process for each number
[06:21] <dabaR> blanky: but...we could restart your screen, but when you restart it will be good
[06:21] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Oh...  Um  you can run a program that comes with the nVidia driver stack called 'nvidia-settings'
[06:21] <blanky> dabaR: I killed the processes
[06:22] <rockinchado> anyone know why my alt+tab stops working when i use xmodmap to switch layouts....i'm using xfce
[06:22] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: You should see on the first page a line that tells you what version it is.
[06:22] <blanky> dabaR: you're sure it will be good? I mean, if I can't open any new windows/programs right now, I'm afraid that when i try to log back in, I won't even be able to start up kde
[06:22] <Lovloss> Any chance that can be done from the command line?
[06:22] <dabaR> blanky: how about sudo kill -9 6192?
[06:22] <blanky> dabaR: I killed them and it's still happening
[06:22] <blanky> dabaR: I killed them
[06:22] <Lovloss> ah
[06:22] <Lovloss> no . its version 8776
[06:23] <slavik> any guides on getting the virtual consoles under edgy?
[06:23] <dabaR> blanky: you murderer
[06:23] <aztracker1> I want to find an nvidia >= 6600 with a heat pipe (gigabyte made a few), but can't seem to find one, my 6800 is too noisy.
[06:23] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: It's a X program so you have to be in an xsession to see it.
[06:23] <aztracker1> slavik, huh?
[06:23] <blanky> lol
[06:23] <blanky> dabaR: I typed that
[06:23] <slavik> aztracker1: have you looked at after market coolers like the silecer ones?
[06:23] <blanky> dabaR: and the processes wont die
[06:23] <dabaR> blanky: with sudo?
[06:23] <blanky> dabaR: yeah
[06:23] <slavik> aztracker1: the ttys ... the ones you can switch to using Ctrl+Alt+F1 (through F6)
[06:23] <aztracker1> slavik, yeah, it's for a SFF (shuttle) case, so most of the aftermarket ones are too big, or too noisy.
[06:24] <Lovloss> ubunjusty so i have to get something else?
[06:24] <slavik> aztracker1: ahh ... have you tried newegg?
[06:24] <aztracker1> slavik, gotcha..
[06:24] <blanky> dabaR: I think I know what's wrong, it's because with vnc it creates profiles or whatever, and I'm running it right now or something, and well, look http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=152556
[06:24] <badmacktuck> =(
[06:24] <blanky> dabaR:
[06:24] <aztracker1> slavik, yeah.. my best bet is finding a used gigabyte 6800 agp... which sucks, I've lost about 3 ebay bids so far..
[06:25] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: I'm sorry.  I missed your last comment.  What was that?
[06:25] <blanky> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34305/
[06:25] <Lovloss> What do i need to do if i am not 9xxx version
[06:25] <aztracker1> got back into a few games again, so I put a 6800 I had laying around in, and it's noisy.. :(
[06:26] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Oh well you would need to get that version of the driver.
[06:26] <badmacktuck> i get an error message about not being able to allocate resources right after i choose "start and install" from the 6.10 boot menu on the live cd
[06:26] <blanky> dabaR: are you there don't leave me please! :'(
[06:26] <slavik> heh
[06:26] <badmacktuck> but it scrolls too fast to read
[06:26] <blanky> dabaR: could it be becasue I removed all of the vnc configuration files in .vnc?
[06:26] <badmacktuck> anyone able to explain that to me?
[06:26] <ubunjusty> Lovloss:  I would suggest using a repo to get the driver instead of trying to build it yourself.
[06:26] <sloof3|arr> dabaR: Nice.  I google again and the i8k utilities are available.  Gkrellm is setup now.
[06:26] <slavik> badmacktuck: how much RAM do you have?
[06:26] <badmacktuck> 512
[06:26] <badmacktuck> ddr
[06:26] <badmacktuck> 2
[06:26] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Um.  Do you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine?
[06:27] <slavik> hmm ...
[06:27] <aztracker1> badmacktuck, I have to install from the "alternate" cd install.. non-gui installer, but works fine.
[06:27] <dabaR> blanky: install irssi, and learn some /commands, and restart and come back in a console( i.e. alt-ctrl-f1 )if it really does not start
[06:27] <Lovloss> ubunjusty: i dont know... u.u
[06:27] <blanky> dabaR: I'm really scared of doing that :'(
[06:27] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: You'll also have to forgive me I'm using a remote machine so I'll try to do most of this from memory.
[06:27] <badmacktuck> i may have to give that a try, its a non standard video card in a laptop
[06:27] <dabaR> blanky: that I can't help with
[06:27] <PMantis> I'm having a problem creating a new initrd with mkinitramfs on Ubuntu 6.10
[06:27] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Ok you can check that by using this command in a terminal.
[06:28] <blanky> dabaR: wait, I just started konqueror, so I think it's just gtk programs
[06:28] <Lovloss> sorry i know so little u.u
[06:28] <blanky> nevermind
[06:28] <blanky> konsole doesn't work
[06:28] <Skwid_> does anyone know of a good wallpaper utility that would cycle through folders, flickr photos, etc, with specific filters such as size, orientation etc
[06:28] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: First run a terminal.  Push Alt+F2  then type 'gnome-terminal'
[06:28] <Lovloss> i have a terminal open already =)
[06:28] <max_> does anyone else have the problem of FF2 closing randomly and very often
[06:29] <blanky> dabaR: will be right back
[06:29] <bimberi> !fffc | max_
[06:29] <ubotu> max_: If Firefox is crashing on sites using Flash try adding "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" to /etc/firefox/firefoxrc (ref: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 )
[06:29] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Once your terminal pops up type the following command:  'uname -a'
[06:29] <dabaR> Skwid_: http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=wallpaper+change+ubuntu+periodically&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
[06:29] <glick> hi
[06:29] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Also you should note that uname is a common tool found in most Unix-like OSes.
[06:29] <glick> excuse me, how come whenever i play an avi the sound lags the picture?
[06:29] <Lovloss> 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 18:45:35 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux is what i got
[06:30] <Skwid_> dabaR: thanks, i tried the webilder one, but it doesnt do folders
[06:30] <w3ccv> the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light  :-)
[06:30] <glick> or rather the sound is out of sinc with the picture
[06:30] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: notice the i686 section.  That means you have a 32-bit system.  64-bit is noted by x86_64
[06:30] <Lovloss> ok
[06:30] <Lovloss> so what should i do next
=== tcli is now known as Illiterite
[06:31] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Um...  Let's see.  First you should make sure that your system is up-to-date...  Let me see.
[06:32] <glick> anyone else hav that problem?
[06:32] <Lovloss> well i just installed ubuntu a week ago
[06:32] <badmacktuck> glick what player are you using
=== Music_Shuffle is now known as Telepathetic
[06:33] <glick> badmacktuck, i tried mplayer and the standard "Movie Player"
[06:33] <glick> totem
[06:33] <badmacktuck> try vlc
[06:33] <badmacktuck> i have the best luck with it
[06:33] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Okay but it never hurts to check.  Usually an icon will appear on your desktop to indicate to you that your software is not up-to-date but if you don't see that icon I guess it will be safe to proceed.
[06:34] <Lovloss> ah that. yes, im up to date
[06:34] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Wait I think I know a good site that you can use to get Beryl started on your system.
[06:34] <max_> bimberi: how do i fix it?
[06:35] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Hey I did run into a slight problem when I installed Beryl.  Are you using a wireless card?
[06:35] <bimberi> max_: the factoid tells you.  Edit that file and add the line to it
[06:35] <slavik> what's a nice latex gui?
[06:35] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: It's really a semantics problem with Ubuntu but it could keep you from getting on the net via wireless.
[06:35] <Lovloss> ubunjusty no, im  comcastic
[06:36] <stiffme1983> hello everyone
[06:36] <slavik> Lovloss: I feel for you ...
[06:36] <uLynx> hi, i've Ubuntu 6.10, with gnome, how can i install superkaramba?
[06:36] <max_> bimberi: it dosnt say how to fix it......its just people sayign they have problems
[06:36] <bimberi> !hi | stiffme1983
[06:36] <ubotu> stiffme1983: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:36] <bimberi> max_: not the webpage, the factoid from ubotu
[06:37] <bimberi> ubotu: tell max_ about fffc | via /msg
[06:37] <slavik> !botsnack
[06:37] <ubotu> Yum!
[06:37] <stiffme1983> is there anyone compile the kernel with ck patch?
[06:37] <max_> i just add that in the file anywhere?
[06:37] <glick> nah vlc is out of sync too
[06:37] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Cool.  Some third party drivers for wireless cards are install via a package named 'X' and since you'll also be upgrading a package call 'X' (but is not related to the first one) it will overwrite the driver you are using for a wireless card even though the driver has nothing to do with wireless cards.
[06:37] <badmacktuck> sorry glick im out of ideas then
[06:37] <bimberi> max_: yep
[06:37] <PMantis> Installing a kernel... can someone please help?
[06:37] <PMantis> Failed to find suitable ramdisk generation tool for kernel version
[06:37] <PMantis> 2.6.17-10-generic on running kernel 2.6.17-10-generic in /usr/sbin/mkinitramfs
[06:38] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851  This is the web address you need.  I thought I had it somewhere in my bookmarks.
[06:38] <poolkey172> strace -p caused the whole of X to hang anyone else experienced this ?
[06:38] <Lovloss> So hold on, do i need to DL xgl or do i already have it? My computer boots up nvidia when i turn it on
[06:38] <stiffme1983> it seems the kernel ck patch can't apply to kernel source smoothlt
=== Telepathetic is now known as Music_Shuffle
[06:39] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: The post is a little dated since the drivers are no longer beta.  But other than that this should fix you.
[06:39] <Illiterite> poolkey172, That is funky... no idea on that one
[06:39] <Lovloss> ubunjusty : and this will let me have all those graphical effects, in gnome?
[06:40] <poolkey172> illiterate : Yeh its weird happens only when I strace a running x app like say firefox etc
[06:40] <Illiterite> hm, lemme give it a shot
[06:40] <poolkey172> illiterate : Cool
[06:40] <Illiterite> nope, works fine for me
[06:40] <poolkey172> Grrrr damn
[06:40] <thrillin`> i need help to partition my mac plz
[06:40] <Illiterite> lol

[06:41] <Lovloss> ok cya guys
[06:41] <Illiterite> lolol
[06:41] <poolkey172> I'm running edgy / fluxbox with one kicker panel
[06:41] <Illiterite> you're doing it from a terminal, right?
[06:41] <ubunjusty> Lovloss: Yeah.  You see Beryl is a OpenGL enabled window manager.  This allows Beryl to present your windows (applications) as textures on 3D shapes.  There is also a lot of plugins to make other nifty effects.  However, all of this is still very new (not a year old) so it isn't perfect.
[06:41] <poolkey172> illiterate yeh from an eterm
[06:41] <thrillin`> any mac users here?
[06:41] <Illiterite> that's funky... never heard of strace crashing anything before
[06:41] <thrillin`> usin ubuntu
[06:42] <poolkey172> Illiterate maybe I should try to generate some logs
[06:42] <ubunjusty> thrillin`: Well I have a set of Macs but none of them are using Ubuntu.
[06:42] <thrillin`> if u help i'll give u my lunch $$
[06:43] <Illiterite> poolkey172: you can try: strace strace -p (pid) &>~/strace.txt

[06:43] <thrillin`> damn like no mac users 2 help huh
[06:43] <thrillin`> this sux
[06:43] <Illiterite> Well, it'll give you an idea (hopefully) of what's going on with the strace

[06:43] <Illiterite> heheh
[06:43] <Illiterite> hm
[06:43] <Illiterite> lemme ask google rq
[06:43] <poolkey172> ok I'll strace this Konversatin window

[06:44] <thrillin`> well anyone know how to partition a mac hdd?
[06:44] <poolkey172> see you all after the crash
[06:44] <Illiterite> poolkey172: paste it to the pastebox thingy and i'll take a look when you get back

[06:45] <poolkey172> Is that ok ?
[06:45] <ubunjusty> uLynx: If I remember correctly.
[06:45] <poolkey172> I'll redirect stderr as well
[06:46] <Illiterite> poolkey172: ditch the spaces
[06:46] <poolkey172> here goes
[06:46] <uLynx> ubunjusty, u remeber correctly
[06:46] <ubunjusty> uLynx: You may need to install some KDE and QT packages in order for it to render everything nicely.
[06:46] <Illiterite> poolkey172: and &> redirects everything
[06:46] <mrmoke> dual boot a Mac , thrillin?
[06:46] <thrillin`> yea
[06:46] <thrillin`> i want to have ubuntu as 2nd OS
[06:46] <poolkey172> Hmmmm
[06:46] <ubunjusty> uLynx: Otherwise, it might not look as nice as you hope.
[06:46] <uLynx> ubunjusty, is there any superkaramba made for just gnome?
[06:46] <poolkey172> I am still here
[06:46] <Illiterite> lol

[06:48] <uLynx> ubunjusty, how do i made desktop icons of calendar, weather, cpu, memory, hard drive etc..etc...
[06:49] <ubunjusty> uLynx: Well I think superkaramba is your best bet.  There is also some little monitor programs like GkrellM
[06:49] <mrmoke> thrillin: try this http://blogs.sun.com/richb/entry/powerbook_dual_boot:_macosx_tiger
[06:49] <slowz3r> can i get some help connectin to a wireless network please?
[06:49] <thrillin`> thx
[06:49] <uLynx> ubunjusty, for gnome?
[06:49] <ubunjusty> uLynx: There is so many programs you may have to play around with some of them and pick which one you like the best.
[06:50] <ubunjusty> uLynx: For weather I just use the weather applet provided with Gnome.
[06:50] <slowz3r> Can i get some wirless network help please?
[06:50] <uLynx> ubunjusty, ic
[06:50] <ubunjusty> uLynx: You can add it to a panel but right mouse clicking on an empty spot on your panel and then click "Add To Panel..."

[06:56] <slowz3r> ubunjusty,
[06:57] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, right now im using wifi radar
[06:57] <ball> hello MistaED
[06:57] <ball> hello Jas-Nix
[06:57] <ball> Is there an ubuntu for UltraSPARC machines?
[06:57] <ball> hello marsu
[06:58] <holycow> ball, no
[06:58] <ubunjusty> slowz3r: I would suggest using NetworkManager. It's pretty useful if you don't want to learn how to do it via the CLI.
[06:58] <holycow> thats #debian
[06:58] <ball> holycow: okay, thanks anyway.
[06:58] <holycow> no worries
[06:58] <nalioth> Illiterite: may i see you in #ubuntu-ops please?
[06:58] <jbroome> Ooooh, you're in trouble
[06:58] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, im a linux newb where can i DL that from
[06:59] <poolkey172> holycow: cant u compile a kernel for a sparc than load ubuntu onto it ?
[06:59] <holycow> no, you haveto recompile all packages for it
[06:59] <bimberi> lol
[06:59] <holycow> ubuntu is basically just frozen debian unstable every 6 months
[06:59] <holycow> you may as well just use debian instead
[06:59] <poolkey172> holycow: doh I forgot the arch
[06:59] <ubunjusty> slowz3r: Um.  Try Synaptic.  It's under "System | Administration | Synaptic Package Manager"  That is if you are using Ubuntu,
[06:59] <highneko> Would I need special cds to use with lightscribe? Could the cd have writing by the company on it?
[07:00] <slowz3r> ya i am using ubuntu
[07:00] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, well it says its a KDE frontend an im using GNome
[07:00] <thrillin`> mrmoke: thx again....lemmie make some backups first...hope its a go
[07:00] <jbroome> highneko: yes, you need special cds to use lightscribe
[07:01] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, nvm i found the gnome front
[07:01] <highneko> How much to these lightscribe cds cost?
[07:01] <jbroome> beats me
[07:01] <jbroome> froogle perhaps
[07:01] <ubunjusty> slowz3r: Ok.  If your using Gnome then I would suggest Network Manager.  It allows support to WPA and WEP enabled networks.  Or if you really wanted to you could learn how to do it via the command line.
[07:02] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, ok i sintalled it with synaptic..but how do i open it up or were is it
[07:02] <justin_> lol wats going on here m8s
[07:02] <dragonfyre13> hey guys.
[07:02] <H3g3m0n> Theres is Ubuntu for sparc
[07:03] <CientificoLoco> how do I install amsn?
[07:03] <H3g3m0n> CientificoLoco: System>Admin>Synaptic
[07:04] <Crescendo_> What kind of macro/hotkey apps are available for Ubuntu/Linux in general?
[07:04] <justin_> windows
[07:04] <simus> ok, ive read the forums over and over, tried all i can find, can someone please help me get my raid working on ubuntu?
[07:04] <justin_> is a good one
[07:04] <justin_> os2 is another good one
[07:04] <holycow> ah nm
[07:04] <ubunjusty> slowz3r: Um...  You should log out and log back into Gnome and it should appear.
[07:04] <holycow> there is indeed a sparc download
[07:04] <holycow> weird but cool
[07:04] <holycow> http://ubuntu.uz/releases/edgy/
[07:05] <dragonfyre13> anyone feel like helping get either suspend working on the lappy, or getting wep keys working with my wireless?

[07:06] <justin_> just saying
[07:06] <Frankenstein> and annoying troll at that
[07:06] <nalioth> frenetik: yes?
[07:06] <whta> let's just suppose for a second that I just downloaded the linux build of songbird and have extracted it.. where would be the most logical place to put the folder that contains the program?
[07:06] <slowz3r> ubunjusty, so log out an log back in?
[07:06] <dragonfyre13> Frankenstein: yep, pretty much.
[07:06] <H3g3m0n> CientificoLoco: amsn is in the universe repository, enable it in settings
[07:06] <dragonfyre13> thanks elkubuntu
[07:06] <Frankenstein> thanks
[07:06] <ubunjusty> slowz3r: Yeah.  It should appear.  Let me know if it doesn't
[07:06] <slowz3r> k
[07:06] <slowz3r> brb
[07:07] <CientificoLoco> H3g3m0n, but I wanna get the last version..
[07:07] <holycow> whta, you don't need to 'install' it if i remember what this is ... you should be able to just double click on the executable binary and it will run ... its that thing built on mozilla right?
[07:07] <dragonfyre13> so, anyone feel like helping?
[07:07] <holycow> if its packaged in a deb it will just ask permission to install of course
[07:07] <Frankenstein> dragonfyre13, i didnt catch your problem
[07:07] <LadyNikon> gn
[07:07] <dragonfyre13> Frankenstein: helping get either suspend working on the lappy, or getting wep keys working with my wireless?
[07:07] <whta> holycow: yes, it's not running it that the problem is. i just don't know where I SHOULD logically put the folder since it's sitting on my desktop
[07:08] <holycow> whta, i'm not sure what you questio nmeans
[07:08] <holycow> i'm telling you that it doesn't matter
[07:08] <holycow> makes sense right?
[07:08] <whta> yes i know
[07:08] <whta> i mean
[07:08] <Frankenstein> well dragonfyre13 wireless and linux SUCK... i could never get it to work and suspend should be in...  menu / system / admin / power managment
[07:08] <whta> whatever, i'll just throw it into my home folder
[07:09] <Frankenstein> wait..
[07:09] <Madpilot> !wireless | dragonfyre13
[07:09] <ubotu> dragonfyre13: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[07:09] <Frankenstein> well dragonfyre13 wireless and linux SUCK... i could never get it to work and suspend should be in...  menu / system / user prefs / power managment
[07:09] <dragonfyre13> Frankenstein: I've got it working without wep, but suspend just doesn't work period.
[07:09] <holycow> dragonfyre13, wep works by default ... you just open the network manager, select wireless cad if its detected and type in wep key
[07:09] <holycow> wpa is a bit of another matter, some tell me there is a gui now for wpa
[07:09] <H3g3m0n> CientificoLoco: 0.96 was just released so it won't be in the repos, you can try the amsn site for their packaged one but 0.96 isn't much diffrent 0.95
[07:10] <ubunjusty> holycow: NetworkManager in Ubuntu 6.10 has WPA support in the GUI.
[07:10] <dragonfyre13> holycow: nope, actually, that's how it should work, but with the rt73 chipset it's another matter.
[07:10] <holycow> dragonfyre13, for the suspend stuff you will need to google your specific laptop model, ubuntu and the instructions on doing that if it works at all
[07:11] <dragonfyre13> holycow: thanks for the suspend stuff. I know that network manager and connection manager support wpa without wpasupplicant package though. Pretty easy from the other cards I've done.
[07:11] <ubunjusty> dragonfyre13:   May I suggest an atheros based card.  They work great in suspend.
[07:11] <holycow> dragonfyre13, then the proper answer is one most poeple don't want to hear actually ... don't spend your life configuring and fighting with proprietary non working stuff, go out and buy a supported pcmcia card and be done with it :)
[07:11] <dragonfyre13> ubunjusty: thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
[07:11] <lia> hi
[07:11] <dragonfyre13> holycow: yeah, I know. Dang it.
[07:11] <dragonfyre13> holycow: thanks though.
[07:11] <holycow> dragonfyre13, yeah no prob, its a non answer, just hoping to help you get to the answers quicker
[07:12] <dragonfyre13> holycow: my goal is to get this lappy up and working fully though. It's one of the hardest apparently, judging by the responses I'm getting.
[07:13] <dragonfyre13> holycow: all the stuff I'm doing right now is integrated stuff though.
[07:13] <holycow> dragonfyre13, its a big issue indeed
[07:14] <dragonfyre13> alright, I'm going to deal with some driver stuff with the  vid card. Be back later.
[07:14] <holycow> as much as i like supporting underdogs like nvidia, for laptops all intel chipsets seem to be the way to go
[07:14] <dragonfyre13> thanks holycow, ubunjusty and Frankenstein
[07:14] <auk> bimberi, thanks
[07:14] <holycow> but thats not an option once you have a laptop already >_<
[07:14] <holycow> 'welcome
[07:14] <dragonfyre13> holycow: I know. I love the lappy though, and for 600 bucks, I couldn't go wrong.
[07:15] <dragonfyre13> holycow: 200 after the windows refund.
[07:15] <holycow> acer 3620?
[07:15] <dragonfyre13> holycow: Averatec 2370
[07:16] <auk> dragonfyre13: we wish
[07:16] <holycow> never heard of it
[07:16] <holycow> heh
[07:16] <holycow> and what do you mean windows refund?
[07:16] <whta> how's dual monitor support?
[07:16] <holycow> :)
[07:16] <holycow> whta, excellent :)
[07:16] <auk> holycow, they don't do those... yet
[07:16] <bob__> What is emacs generally used for. Is it mainly used by programmers. Or can it be used to do other things
[07:16] <thrillin`> night ppl...thx again 4 helps
[07:16] <whta> holycow: think it'll detect no problem if I just plug the other sucker in and boot 'er up?
[07:17] <holycow> bob__, generally by programmers you can use it for text editing, writing books, etc.  people have written games in it actually
[07:17] <thrillin`> i could cath 5 hrs sleep still yay
[07:17] <dragonfyre13> holycow: Just refuse the EULA, and then call the manufacturer. Let them know you refused it, and send them a paper signed by the store saying that you removed the OS (Windows) in the store entirely. They are legally bound to send a refund for the amount of the OS.
[07:17] <holycow> its written in lisp and insanely powerfull and easy to extend, you could make it do pretty much anything if you wanted to
[07:17] <yanqing> the system installed on my usb-storage device.
[07:17] <dragonfyre13> holycow: since they can't publish how much they paid MS for it, they give you the retail cost.
[07:17] <holycow> dragonfyre13, i have NEVER had that work
[07:17] <yanqing> i use the general vesa driver for xorg
[07:17] <holycow> wow you actually got your money back?
[07:18] <holycow> actually that CANNOT work according to  ms licencing
[07:18] <dragonfyre13> holycow: lemme pull up a few links. I get my check next week.
[07:18] <holycow> if they are using oem ... the licence dies when they uninstall it
[07:18] <yanqing> why it will auto changed the xorg.conf on different machine
[07:18] <holycow> which  means the store/manufacturer eats 200
[07:18] <holycow> yanqing, what do you mean?
[07:18] <dragonfyre13> holycow: it does. It says you are entitled to a refund for the "software" from the manufacturer if you refuse any clause in the EULA
[07:19] <bob__> So for the average user it is not generally used. Why would I use it for text editing if open office or abiword also allows me to make corrections to document editing.
[07:19] <holycow> thats for retail copies
[07:19] <holycow> not for oem preinstalled
[07:19] <inono> How do I configure an Ubuntu firewall
[07:19] <inono> ?
[07:19] <jbroome> !iptables
[07:19] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[07:19] <holycow> the licence for that from ms says that the licence dies with the laptop once installed ... maybe theres fine print i'm missing
[07:19] <yanqing> holycow, kubuntu will auto detect my display card and changed the xorg.conf for it
[07:19] <holycow> dragonfyre13, however, WOW!
[07:19] <holycow> thats wicked, 400 dollar laptop :)
[07:19] <dragonfyre13> http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html
[07:19] <holycow> good going dude
[07:19] <dragonfyre13> that's an old one. Dell isn't as easy.
[07:20] <dragonfyre13> there was a big thing around the turn of the mellenium about it. Feb 15 is still windows refund day.
[07:20] <holycow> yanqing, i dind't know they implemented that ... neat.  its must be part of hotplug ... hotplug basically is designed to modularly detect stuff and adjust your ocnfig ... so you can say take an hd plug it in anywhere and it works
[07:20] <auk> are there any issues with amd64 images?
[07:20] <MistaED> ok, then do you need to agree/disagree to the EULA before you buy the machine then which has windows OEM preinstalled?
[07:21] <bob__> Windows refund day!. Wait till Vista comes out first. He He!!
[07:21] <dragonfyre13> MistaED: yeah. Hang on, let me grab a link for the form.
[07:21] <holycow> yanqing, i didn't know it worked for xorg stuff yet ... there is some xorg work comming to actually have dbus ping hotplug or whatever and change xorg in real time
[07:21] <Crescendo_> What kind of macro/hotkey apps are available for Ubuntu/Linux in general?
[07:21] <auk> ...i have a friend who said he tried one, didn't work, so he used the i386... he's rather new to linux, not quite sure what happened
[07:21] <holycow> yanqing, i think you can modify th erules for hotplug to ignore xorg if that is what its doing, i just don't know how
[07:21] <holycow> Crescendo, depends on the desktop
[07:22] <dragonfyre13> http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7040
[07:22] <auk> MistaED: the terms say you have to terminate service immediately if you don;t agree
[07:22] <yanqing> holycow, thanks
[07:22] <MistaED> holycow: yep xorg 7.3 is getting all these updates for a modular xorg config, which is plugged into dbus :D i hope feisty's 7.2 has that config stuff backported from 7.3
[07:22] <auk> so you can buy it, but must not use it ( / keep it installed)
[07:22] <holycow> Crescendo, typically gnome and kde have their own native apps, and no one reqally bothers writing third party stuff for this as its poitnless (maybe not for everyone i guess).  other desktops have their own native apps as well
[07:22] <holycow> MistaED, that would be cool
[07:22] <holycow> yanqing, indeed, no problem
[07:23] <file13> Does anyone know of a program that allow you to have multiple workspaces like in linux?
[07:23] <Crescendo_> holycow, I'm looking for something specific to hotkeying a line of characters - Ubuntu, Gnome. :/
[07:23] <file13> on a windows box
[07:23] <holycow> Crescendo, in gnome its /system/preferences/keyboard shortcuts
[07:23] <holycow> thats prettyh much it for gnome
[07:23] <holycow> don't know about kde
[07:24] <auk> file13: there is such i program, i know of it (can't remember the name)
[07:24] <holycow> file13, on microsoft.com they have some crappy app that does that yes
[07:24] <holycow> search their site
[07:24] <auk> but it doesn't work so well, i hear
[07:24] <bob__> I wish Apple would natively port Quicktime and iTunes to GNU/Linux.
[07:24] <Crescendo_> holycow, it won't let me add new ones.  :/
[07:24] <file13> cheers
[07:24] <auk> bob__: i don't
[07:24] <holycow> Crescendo, *nod* it is limited i hear ... thats pretty much it as far as i know ... i'm sorry.
[07:24] <bob__> Still can't watch Macworld streams
[07:24] <bob__> Why?.
[07:24] <auk> i wish more people would start supporting ogg
[07:25] <Crescendo_> No problem. :)
[07:25] <holycow> bob__, because apple are worse than ms at supporting open source
[07:25] <Crescendo_> gDesklets Shell doesn't seem to be starting up all the way... :/
[07:25] <Ronfar> I'm experiencing a problem if anyone cares to help, I'd greatly apperciate it. It seems to only happen using IRC or posting on the Ubuntu fourms I experience a freeze which turns my screen White with horizontal lines. It happens randomly could be 5mins to 5 hours I never know, I also haven't noticed it happening with certain programs I run and I run minimal progs at that
[07:25] <holycow> so much for the famous egalatarian higher mindset of the mac users
[07:25] <holycow> it turns out they are as much of a cult as we are :)
[07:26] <PMantis> How can i get vi to equal vim in Edgy?
[07:26] <dawkirst> How does HP laptops compare to brands like Toshiba and Lenovo?
[07:26] <holycow> Ronfar, that would indicate a video card driver issue by your description
[07:26] <bob__> I thought Apple helped out with konquerer, since safari is related.
[07:26] <MistaED> holycow: they have no problems using open source in their OS though ;)
[07:26] <holycow> there is nothing on ubuntu forums to trigger say extensions or plugins that might crash a video drivers
[07:26] <Vande8594> how can i directly connect a ubuntu system to a windows xp system to get an internet conn. of the windows comp.
[07:26] <auk> bob__: sort... of
[07:26] <holycow> well you might want to try removing all firefox extensions first and try again
[07:27] <holycow> Ronfar, but what video card do you have? and what drivers are you using?
[07:27] <arepie> is there a command which i can check my 3D acceleration is working?
=== Byan_ is now known as Byan
[07:27] <auk> they sort... of donated the code they produced back
[07:27] <holycow> MistaED, thats what i mean, its mostly a one way street with that company
[07:27] <dragonfyre13> holycow: anyway, I'm going to go. Check this out, and google for windows refund for more info. http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7040
[07:27] <Ronfar> Acctually I am just using a built in video card, I'm not sure what is.. The drivers I assume were automatically detected and installed when I installed Ubuntu
[07:27] <holycow> MistaED, if it wasn't for bsd they would of been dead, their os experiment was basically dead before someone pulled th eplug and said go with bsd
[07:28] <holycow> if it wasn't for the bsd licence, apple would not be here today, at least thats my not so humble opinion
[07:28] <dragonfyre13> Bye all. Be back later.
[07:28] <holycow> dragonfyre13, later
[07:28] <Ronfar> This computer is fairly old it's a PIII so perhaps my video card could be giving out?
[07:29] <holycow> ronaldo, that is possible too, there could be other anomalies.... have you eliminated your monitor and video connectors out of the equation?
[07:29] <bob__> I agree a one way street with Apple.
[07:29] <mc_> arepie,   glxinfo | grep direct
[07:29] <MistaED> holycow: maybe in another form, using NT or go with linux
[07:29] <Ronfar> My monitor/connectors I assume would be out of the equation as I just purchased them 6 months ago
[07:30] <arepie> mc_, i suppose that to check Direct randering for OpenGL
[07:30] <holycow> MistaED, i doubth they would of  ever capitulated to the gpl
[07:30] <holycow> mr. turtleneck would rather sign a deal with the devil than capitulate to sharing
[07:30] <dawkirst> And what is the "best" processing technology to look for when buying a laptop?
[07:30] <mc_> arepie, if it says direct rendering: yes then 3d is working
[07:30] <jules_> Does anybody know a cure for my problem? I am using Kubuntu 6.10 and it wont switch off after boot down. I have to press the power button for 5 seconds to make it switch off
[07:30] <Ronfar> Funny thing is though it never happens when I use Ajunta to program or vist any other sites only when I come on IRC it seems to trigger it the most and once in awhile on Ubuntu fourms
[07:30] <holycow> but that is my opinion, and my opinion alone
[07:30] <holycow> :)
[07:31] <bob__> I wonder if Apple using the BSD license has anything to do with Steve Jobs and Woz going to Berkley.
[07:31] <holycow> dawkirst, for laptops, imho, right now intel
[07:31] <holycow> they have open sourced all their chipset drivers, tho they remain faithfully evil in a bunch of areas
[07:31] <MistaED> holycow: really their key program they really need is their desktop technology, they could just plunk that on top of linux, but yeah i'd doubt they would due to all the TPM locks they need to keep OSX running on intel
[07:31] <holycow> intel based laptops will be easiest to setup
[07:31] <arepie> mc_, not for me.. i check my system using cedega.. and it says that my OpenGL is working and 3D acceleration is not.. and my direct randering is a "yes"
[07:31] <holycow> MistaED, *nod*
[07:31] <dawkirst> holycow: Why so, besides the fact that AMD is unlikely to be found in a laptop around here?
[07:32] <holycow> dawkirst, because compared to other chip manufacturers all of their chipset drivers are open source
[07:32] <holycow> however
[07:32] <holycow> someone correct me about the 3d accelerated stuff
[07:32] <holycow> i'm not certain if all the 3d accelerated stuff is FULLY open sourced ... it may be a halway hack
[07:32] <holycow> nvidia and all the others have spotty support in comparison it seems to me
[07:33] <Ronfar> holycow: thanks for the advice, I'll try a card from another one of my computers and see if thats the problem, let you know if it works or not thanks again
[07:33] <mc_> arepie, Ok I don't know about cedega I'm afraid but that is the test I always understood to be accurate for accelerated 3d. I have had opengl working without accelereation and it says no.
[07:33] <holycow> Ronfar, no prob
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[07:33] <dawkirst> holycow: and what brand of laptop would you suggest?
[07:34] <dawkirst> holycow: and what brand Intel CPU? Intel Core Duo?
[07:34] <holycow> dawkirst, laptop brands are irrelevant really
[07:34] <holycow> all the components are made by the same chinese manufacturers
[07:35] <holycow> what matters is the components in the laptop
[07:35] <slowz3r> can someone recommend me a good program to veiw and connect to wifi networks
[07:35] <holycow> so if you by intel chipset laptops you are pretty well guaranteed everything working out of the box except winmodems
[07:35] <bob__> I feel Mark Shuttleworth is going to be the next big player, but without the greed that Jobs and Gates has. Thankfully!!.
[07:35] <dawkirst> holycow: OK.
[07:36] <holycow> bob__, i want him to make money, i thin kthere is quite a bit of money to be made in support but then i don't have the capital to place that bet
[07:37] <slowz3r> can someone recomend a program that i can use to view and connect to wifi networks
[07:37] <bob__> I want him to make money too. But he is more for the user, and wants people of all economic backgrounds to enjoy using a computer and learning from it.
[07:38] <holycow> very smart fellow indeed
[07:38] <holycow> kind and generous too
[07:38] <holycow> although that makes him sound more like buddha than human
[07:38] <holycow> heh
[07:38] <bob__> Unlike Apple and Microsoft. You need allot of money just to afford a computer with loads of software, like you get with Ubuntu.
[07:39] <holycow> i can't use windows any more
[07:39] <holycow> not just because there are no free programs
[07:39] <holycow> the workflow of the desktop is terrible for me
[07:39] <holycow> so yeah, ubuntu all the way :)
[07:39] <bob__> What does MS do?. Offer Windows XP Starter Edition. A slap in the face to poor countries. Why not XP Pro at a reduced cost.
[07:40] <oppinito> what is the default password for root?
[07:40] <holycow> then they have the problem of justifying pricing in rich countriies
[07:40] <holycow> if you chared $2 for an os in thailand you gotta be able to turn around and justify why it costs 200 in north america
[07:41] <holycow> oppinito, there is no root on ubuntu
[07:41] <holycow> !root
[07:41] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[07:41] <holycow> read that pls
[07:41] <holycow> ask questions if you don't know how to use sudo
[07:41] <bob__> Why not just charge for Office and give away the operating system!. Not every program in GNU/Linux is free. Look at Maya.
[07:42] <Zazrael> holycow: There is in fact root on ubuntu, it's just marked as no login and has no password hash.
[07:42] <holycow> bob__, well because taxation is the worlds most successfull business
[07:42] <bob__> Office is their bread and butter
[07:42] <holycow> you don't make the kinds of margins they make without figuring out a way to impose an ms tax on all hardware
[07:42] <holycow> why do you think they are going into the business of supplying software for tv sets?
[07:42] <holycow> bob__, actually no
[07:42] <bob__> I would pay for Office
[07:42] <holycow> windows is
[07:42] <slowz3r> Whats a good program i can use to view and connect to Wirless networks besides Wifi Radar
[07:43] <holycow> office is very much #2 on their profit / loss statements
[07:43] <holycow> few people pay for office
[07:43] <holycow> EVERYONE pays for windows ... its built into the price of every dell
[07:43] <holycow> it used to be built into the price of every system even ones without windows before they got taken to court over their monopoly
[07:43] <wenko> I have never payed
[07:44] <holycow> slowz3r, system/admin/networking ... the applet will automatically show yhou what network is available
[07:44] <holycow> besides that i'm not sure, that always has worked well for us
[07:44] <bob__> Yeh but when you get a Dell, ask for all the software on disk when you get it. Not just a recovery disk
[07:44] <slavik> holycow: "Dell recommends Windows XP" < that gets dell a dollar off every OEM version of Windows XP :)
[07:45] <holycow> slavik, right, its a dollar you still pay and its a dollar that still goes to them
[07:45] <holycow> either way, taxes rarely come down once the consumer is used to paying them
[07:45] <holycow> wenko, the only money ms made from me was windows 98, and recently win2k3 licence with 10 cals and some shit like that
[07:45] <bob__> And Dell tech support. Better learn a second language.
[07:46] <holycow> wenko, but overall they have made almost no money from me, and never will
[07:46] <thevenin> i hate dells tech support
[07:46] <slowz3r> holycow, its only the network settings thing i dont see any available networks
[07:46] <bob__> Has anyone tried Xara Linux Edition. Have it on my Dapper and love it!!.
[07:48] <holycow> slowz3r, sometimes you haveto close the popup and double click on the wireless card again to see it
[07:48] <holycow> it has to have enough time to go into scan mode or whatever to sense the networks
[07:48] <slowz3r> holycow, well im not using a care im using an external usb antena
[07:49] <holycow> slowz3r, oh in that case the problem is the drivers
[07:49] <holycow> slowz3r, i don't know of a single usb wireless adapter that works
[07:49] <DanaG> WTF?  Lately my Gnome 'Run Application" dialog has begun to FORCE autocomplete
[07:49] <holycow> :/ but i've not really tried them, perhaps there are some listed on the wiki known to work?
[07:49] <dseazrca> 13:52 [freenode]  DCC SEND from CrackBaby [0.0.0.0 port 0] : GayNiggerAssociationOfAmerica [0B bytes]  requested in  channel #ubuntu
[07:49] <DanaG> so I end up trying to run things like:
[07:49] <DanaG> amarokok
[07:49] <DanaG> updatete-manager
[07:49] <DanaG> synaptictic
[07:49] <slowz3r> holycow, well i can see networks with wifi radar..i just want a better more developed way of looking at networks
[07:50] <DanaG> nvidia-ia-settings
[07:50] <holycow> slowz3r, try kizmet for looking for networks
[07:50] <DanaG> How do I fix this?
[07:50] <bob__> How many Windows managers do you all have loaded on your machine. Curious
[07:50] <slowz3r> alright
[07:50] <DanaG> mozillalla-thunderbird
[07:50] <slowz3r> holycow, alright ill try
[07:50] <slowz3r> holycow, isnt that for a KDE enviroment
[07:51] <DanaG> It's damn annoying -- how do I fix it?
[07:51] <DanaG> gconf-editoritor
[07:51] <dseazrca> ...
[07:51] <Math^> guys... what about nvu with php...??
[07:51] <nalioth> dseazrca: did you get your invitation?
[07:51] <Math^> is there some plugin for it?
[07:51] <holycow> slowz3r, it makes no diff, gnome/kde apps work on either environment
[07:52] <dseazrca> nalioth: no
[07:52] <holycow> slowz3r, and the answer is actually no
[07:52] <nalioth> dseazrca: join me in #ubuntu-ops for a minute, please
[07:52] <slowz3r> holycow, oo well im a linux nub...so ya bare with me
[07:52] <holycow> DanaG, i'm going to take a wild stab at this and suggest your keyboard is busted
[07:52] <DanaG> Nope, it's Gnome that's doing it.
[07:52] <holycow> DanaG, your explanation in understand but i cannot see how it could result in such errors
[07:52] <DanaG> try going to the run dialog
[07:52] <holycow> slowz3r, no biggie just ask away
[07:53] <holycow> DanaG, you have definitavely ruled out your keyboard?
[07:53] <DanaG> then start typing, and when a suggestion pops up, move to the end and finish typing
[07:53] <DanaG> It's essentially FORCING autocomplete.
[07:53] <slowz3r> holycow, well how can i get kizmet..its not in synaptec
[07:53] <holycow> DanaG, well yes it does autocomplete, you just hit enter and done
[07:53] <holycow> are you trying to keep on typing after autocomplete?
[07:53] <Math^> is there some PHP-plugin for NVU ???
[07:53] <DanaG> In my case, it's finishing the line with no prompting.
[07:53] <Math^> maybe, somewere?\
[07:53] <holycow> slowz3r, it is, you need to enable universe or whatever
[07:54] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: spell it right?
[07:54] <DanaG> It used to work like this: keep typing, it doesn't autocomplete.
[07:54] <holycow> DanaG, its not highlighting the prompt/suggestion?
[07:54] <holycow> !kizmet
[07:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kizmet - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:54] <oppinito> jre isn't included with the default ubuntu installation right?
[07:54] <DanaG> The odd thing is that it's accepting it as soon as I type the very next letter
[07:54] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, kizmet...right>?
[07:55] <Math^> @_o
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: kismet baby, kismet
[07:55] <monokrome> o_@
[07:55] <holycow> ah!
[07:55] <holycow> lol sorry dude :) well there ya go
[07:55] <DanaG> so I'l' end up typing nvid<ia->ia-settings
[07:55] <DanaG> where the brackets mark the enclosed part.
[07:55] <DanaG> er, autocompleted.
[07:55] <holycow> oppinito, no but you can install it from repos just fine
[07:55] <holycow> DanaG, but its supposed to do that?
[07:55] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, well that would help
[07:55] <slowz3r> lol
[07:56] <DanaG> No,
[07:56] <holycow> it autocompletes on all default installs
[07:56] <badmacktuck> has anyone had any problems getting 6.10 to run on an x700
[07:56] <DanaG> it's supposed to let you keep typing the rest of the word.
[07:56] <jules_> Is Xara a program that you have to buy? Or can you get it free for Kubuntu?
[07:56] <holycow> DanaG, have you looked for gnome settings via gconf editor to turn this off?
[07:56] <badmacktuck> the live cd doesnt display anything and the text install doesnt do much better
[07:56] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, after i install it using synaptec do i need to log out an log back in?
[07:57] <holycow> jules_, xara is being open sourced ... sort of.  i think its in the repos
[07:57] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: shouldn't , if your network driver is loaded and working, it should just work
[07:57] <DanaG> Nothing in gconf.
[07:57] <jules_> I have tried  apt-get xara and it cant find it yet
[07:57] <bob__> You can get it (XaraXtreme) for free but only for Linux. http://www.xaraxtreme.org/
[07:57] <holycow> jules_, search for it first with apt-cache search xara
[07:57] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, i cant find it in any of the menues
=== koro_ is now known as korozion
[07:58] <bob__> Just download it and run the bin.
[07:58] <holycow> lol
[07:58] <holycow> no
[07:58] <holycow> install it from repos
[07:58] <holycow> :)
[07:58] <holycow> *cough* :)
[07:58] <holycow> bob__, binary is statically linked i guess?
[07:58] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: while you're installing, also do  'sudo apt-get install menu'  takes a while for it to get setup after install, but then you can add the 'debian' menu....will show many more apps installed
[07:58] <bob__> Yep
[07:59] <holycow> neat.  then you can do what bob__ said too :)
[07:59] <DanaG> I'll ask in #gnome tomorrow.
[07:59] <jules_> Thanks
[07:59] <holycow> DanaG, that might be better indeed
[07:59] <DanaG> Too late at night now -- back from thanksgiving break.
[07:59] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: many apps don't show up in the default menus, just run them from the commandline or the Run dialog
[07:59] <holycow> DanaG, sorry we couldn't help you
[07:59] <DanaG> Okay.
[07:59] <bob__> It is similar to Inkscape
[07:59] <bob__> But easier to use
[07:59] <jules_> It is unedr xaralx
[08:00] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, thats the problem im a noob and have very little knowledge on how to do anything
[08:00] <bob__> Yep
[08:00] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: that's why I gave you the exact command ;-)
[08:00] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: you can find 'menu' in synaptic too if you like
[08:00] <bob__> Having Gimp and Xara is like having Photoshop and Illustrator
[08:01] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, and i get this in return   """E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[08:01] <slowz3r> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[08:01] <slowz3r> """"
[08:01] <jules_> Great
[08:01] <jules_> I am still learning Gimp
[08:01] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: either you aren't using 'sudo' or you are doing two installations at once
[08:01] <jules_> I am only a beginner
[08:01] <holycow> jules_, gimp is amazing
[08:01] <holycow> jules_, if you DON'T know photoshop that is GREAT
[08:01] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: you can only run one apt-get at a time
[08:02] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: one instance that is
[08:02] <holycow> it will make it super easy to learn gimp
[08:02] <holycow> if you knew photoshop it would be very hard to unlearn ... as dumb as that sounds
[08:02] <holycow> jules_, let me know if you have any gimp questions in know it very well
[08:02] <jules_> Thanks a lot
[08:02] <jules_> I will
[08:02] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, ok i got it workin..so after it did all that crap it did what shall i do
[08:02] <holycow> no prob
[08:02] <bob__> If you use Gnome or KDE you can create an icon link as well. It comes with a png for that.
[08:03] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: maybe start up kismet?  though you might want to read how it works a bit too
[08:03] <dogfood2006> What would you do if your Gnome panel disappears?
[08:03] <dogfood2006> delete the .gnomeprofile file?
[08:03] <macd> restart my gnome session
[08:03] <oppinito> alright so i installed sun java 5.0 runtime
[08:03] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: your issue is that your driver for your wireless isn't loaded or maybe not supported, you really need to figure that out first
[08:03] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, ok how the hell do i start up kismet then..
[08:03] <dogfood2006> macd: how do you do that? you mean bounce the xserver?
[08:03] <oppinito> but when i try to run java stuff firefox still tells me i need a plugin
[08:03] <holycow> dogfood2006, open up gconf editor and check off visible for the panel in question
[08:03] <macd> dogfood2006, essentialy yes
[08:03] <holycow> alt/f2 gconf-editor i think it is
[08:04] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: type 'kismet' in a terminal
[08:04] <macd> or use the keyboard shortcut for ruinning a command
[08:04] <holycow> oppinito, the java .so is in the wrong directory i bet
[08:04] <slowz3r> Kingsqueak, it works i can view networks and i connect to my own wirless network
[08:04] <oppinito> holycow:  so what should i do
[08:04] <holycow> oppinito, well pretty much exactly what i told you :)
[08:04] <dogfood2006> Where is the binary for gconf editor?
[08:04] <jules_> Does anyone know where I can get any borders to use with Scribus? I have some , but not many
[08:05] <oppinito> holycow: what directory should it be in
[08:05] <holycow> oppinito, i don't knkow exactly where the tick boxes are, you will need to find them
[08:05] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: o.k. I guess I didn't understand your previous question then
[08:05] <dogfood2006> I'd like to do this via the command line if possible
[08:05] <holycow> oppinito, just type in gconf-editor
[08:05] <dogfood2006> over ssh
[08:05] <oppinito> holycow: tick boxes? what?
[08:05] <Kingsqueak> slowz3r: thought you needed something to see what wireless networks were available?
[08:05] <holycow> oppinito, *sigh* okay listen
[08:05] <holycow> hit alt/f2
[08:05] <holycow> that will bring up a command prompt
[08:05] <holycow> in there type in gconf-editor
[08:06] <oppinito> alright
=== c0 is now known as ce_alpha
[08:06] <holycow> once you have the editor running you need to find the right keys to check off to turn on the panels
[08:06] <holycow> i don't know what they are tho so don't ask me, ther eis a search function in the tool
[08:06] <oppinito> panels? keys? what
[08:06] <holycow> oppinito, are you comprehending what i'm saying?
[08:06] <holycow> did you even try it?
[08:07] <oppinito> holycow: i have gconf-editor open but i have no idea what you're talking about
[08:07] <holycow> you know, i gave you the answer, questioning my answer makes me angry and not want to help you
[08:07] <holycow> right?
[08:07] <oppinito> holycow: uh are you sure you're talking to the right person? my problem is with JRE
[08:07] <holycow> oppinito, really? oh :) my bad!
[08:07] <Kingsqueak> oppinito: there's a seperate package for the browser plugin if you used the ubuntu java install
[08:08] <dogfood2006> .so files are essentially .dll files in windows correct? If oyu had to make an analogy
[08:08] <dogfood2006> Dynamic link libraries?
[08:08] <holycow> oppinito, sorry bro :) didn't mean that, for java you just need to find the java .so file and put it in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[08:08] <dogfood2006> Or are they static libraries?
[08:08] <holycow> and your done
[08:08] <Zer0> Hello
[08:08] <oppinito> ah alright thanks
[08:09] <klasher> LOL
[08:09] <klasher> :)
[08:09] <Zer0> I seem to be having trouble browsing the internet and connecting to online services Using Ubuntu and My Zyxel Wireless Card.
[08:09] <klasher> ubuntu, where are you?
[08:09] <klasher> ubotu, where are you?
[08:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about where are you? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:09] <Kingsqueak> oppinito: try this   apt-cache search java | sort | grep plugin
[08:09] <klasher> ubotu, raw sex!
[08:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about raw sex! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:10] <klasher> ;)
[08:10] <klasher>  I'm new, sorry.
[08:10] <thevenin> klasher: knock it off please
[08:10] <dogfood2006> I have a question, is there a manpage for apt-get packages?
[08:10] <Zer0> Ubuntu has already loaded my wifi driver for my card and I have configured it for my WPA network. As far as I can tell dhcp is grabbing an IP. Can somone help me track down the issue
[08:10] <klasher> thevenin, that is the last time. sorry.
[08:10] <dogfood2006> I can do a apt-cache search, but can I have a description as well
[08:11] <thevenin> its ok
[08:11] <oppinito> Kingsqueak: alright what should i be looking for (and what should i be doing)
[08:11] <dogfood2006> In a package management like adept, I can see this, and it' really nice, but I would like to have the capability of doing this via command line
[08:11] <Kingsqueak> dogfood2006: 'apt-get packages' I'm not clear on that?
[08:11] <klasher> himself*
[08:11] <oppinito> i see this on the list j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin - Java plugin for mozilla/firefox
[08:11] <Kingsqueak> oppinito: if you run that command I pasted, it will show you packages that match, pick one and do  'sudo apt-get install <whatever>'
[08:11] <dogfood2006> Kingsqueak: A short description of what's available on the apt-get repository.
[08:12] <dogfood2006> Using Adept, you can get description of each downloadable apt-get (package) not sure if that's the right word
[08:12] <Kingsqueak> dogfood2006: the short descriptions come up via apt-cache search <foo> , but I find browsing randomly using synaptic or aptitude a bit nicer
[08:13] <Kingsqueak> dogfood2006: it's doable but you need to pick a package and then pass another option to apt-cache to see more detail, it gets tedious
[08:13] <Zer0> Does Ubuntu have a network manager in the GUI or do you always have to install one?
[08:13] <RichiH> is edubuntu also a live or only an install cd?
[08:13] <Kingsqueak> dogfood2006: if you do 'man apt-cache' you'll see the options
[08:13] <thevenin> RichiH: i do beleive it is only install
[08:14] <RichiH> thevenin: ah, thanks
[08:14] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: for wireless, edgy installs a newer one that works better, with Dapper you needed to install network-manager and network-manager-gnome manually
[08:14] <dogfood2006> Is information actually cached? is that why the command uses  'apt-cache' as nomenclature?
[08:14] <RichiH> it offers install and install on a workstation.. difference?
[08:14] <thevenin> RichiH: not really
[08:14] <Zer0> I belive I have edgy installed
[08:15] <Kingsqueak> RichiH: I *think* edubuntu has an option to do xterminals, thin clients, so the server option may be to host that and workstation may include a full desktop GUI
[08:15] <Kingsqueak> RichiH: just guessing from what I've seen here though
[08:15] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: using iwconfig wlan0 the output indicates the following Access Point: Invalid
[08:15] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: does wlan0 show up in ifconfig -a ?
[08:16] <RichiH> Kingsqueak: makes sense though. thanks
[08:16] <Zer0> no
[08:16] <Kingsqueak> RichiH: people talk about doing http://www.ltsp.org/ with edubuntu as an example
[08:16] <Zer0> Bare with me
[08:16] <Zer0> I am new... Should my typed bash command be (iwconfig -a)?
[08:17] <hazarath> Er... hi... trying to install restricted formats, all fail, says no such package.
[08:17] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: not iwconfig, but  'ifconfig -a'
[08:17] <Zer0> Ah yea
[08:17] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: if you don't see an interface there, your wireless driver may not be loaded
[08:17] <Zer0> I see eth0, sit0, lo, wlan0
[08:17] <malt> hey Kingsqueak :D
[08:18] <Zer0> So it appears the driver is loaded
[08:18] <hazarath> Need help installing restricted formats.
[08:18] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: ah good so it would appear your wireless is loaded, so in one of the gnome menus there is a networking setup section, that should do the trick
[08:18] <Kingsqueak> hey malt
[08:18] <Zer0> This is where I get confused Kind
[08:18] <Zer0> King
[08:19] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: you running Gnome or KDE?
[08:19] <Zer0> Gnome
[08:19] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: on the top launcher bar, there is what, Administration I think right?
[08:19] <malt> anyone know how i can give me lan ip to resolve to a hostname? i know it is not something i really need just thought i would do it since nothing else to do
[08:19] <Zer0> Yes. I have already gone to Administration > Network Settigns
[08:20] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: o.k.
[08:20] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: and what happened
[08:20] <Zer0> I see 3 devices listed
[08:20] <Zer0> Wireless , Wired, modem
[08:20] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: k, click on wireless
[08:20] <Zer0> I have unchecked wired and modem
[08:20] <Zer0> Yes
[08:20] <Zer0> I have already enabled the device
[08:21] <Zer0> Choosen my ESSID
[08:21] <DanaG> well, whaddaya know... it WAS my keyboard.
[08:21] <Zer0> Set my WPA password
[08:21] <Kingsqueak> malt: if it's just for one machine to see, add it to /etc/hosts, otherwise you need BIND/named installed and that's a bit of work to figure out
[08:21] <Zer0> And Set it to DHCP for configuration
[08:21] <DanaG> It started acting like SHIFT and/or CTRL were held down.
[08:21] <DanaG> I had to kill X -- now it's normal again.
[08:22] <Kingsqueak> malt: syntax is    <IP address>   name.you.want.to.call.it
[08:22] <hazarath> Need help with restricted formats, dice, please.
[08:22] <malt> Kingsqueak: will this save?
[08:22] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: o.k., what happened?
[08:22] <malt> or have to do this on every resart with server?
[08:22] <Kingsqueak> malt: yes it stays
[08:22] <Zer0> Kingsqueak so I have already gotten this far
[08:22] <malt> solike 192.168.1.5 m4lt.com?
[08:23] <Kingsqueak> malt: you make the /etc/hosts entry on the machine you are connecting with, not the one you are connecting to, you are basically fooling your local machine to believe the name for the IP you setup there
[08:23] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: o.k., well, did it connect?
[08:23] <Zer0> I set the properties to my wireless connection to my ESSID and entered the WPA key set to ANSII and choose DHCP however No dice
[08:23] <Zer0> Still can't pull web pages
[08:23] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: you sure the key is ascii and not hex?
[08:23] <Zer0> WPA?
[08:23] <PMantis> Anyone see a reason to have a separate partition for /var/log on a laptop?
[08:24] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: ah k
=== user-land_ is now known as user-land
[08:24] <diskus> PMantis: no
[08:24] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: ESSID and passphrase are case sensitive, any mistake there?
[08:24] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: Checking
[08:24] <diskus> PMantis: I see reason to have seperate partition for /home only
[08:24] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: After ya done with him, may I borrow ya attention?
[08:25] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: just ask in channel please
[08:25] <PMantis> diskus, I have separate /home and /tmp right now.
[08:25] <hazarath> I did, heh...
[08:25] <hazarath> I need to install restricted formats.
[08:25] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: I'm pretty beat so I'm wearing out ;-)
[08:25] <diskus> PMantis: it depends on how large disk you have
[08:25] <hazarath> Ah, heh.
[08:25] <defrysk> !resticted formats > hazarath
[08:25] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about resticted formats - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:25] <Firefishe> When I'm generating a gpg key pair, I get this error:  gpg: can't open `/home/rtip/.gnupg/random_seed': Permission denied  ..  any ideas?

[08:26] <defrysk> hmmm
[08:26] <Firefishe> I'm running ubuntu dapper on powerpc
[08:26] <Kingsqueak> !wmv
[08:26] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:26] <hazarath> I tried the forms.
[08:26] <diskus> PMantis: I have 20GB / (root) so it's basicaly useless to use /tmp and /var partitions
[08:26] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: run as root?
[08:26] <hazarath> All the packages, minus one, isn't found.
[08:26] <thevenin> hazarath: this may help http://knowledge76.com/index.php/Installing_Restricted_Formats
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: be more specific, what are you missing, what is the issue etc
[08:27] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: Yes I verified the information
[08:27] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: everyting is in the proper CASE
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: if you do 'ifconfig -a' now, do you see that you have an IP on wlan0 ?
[08:27] <Firefishe> DARKGuy:  Well, perhaps, but why would the program--which resides in /usr/local/bin--need to be run as root when I'm runnning it as my  own regular user?  I should be able to write to my own directory, shouldn't I>?
[08:27] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: I wanna play all the 'non-free' formats by system defalt.
[08:27] <Zer0> Checking
[08:28] <CarCase928> hello, how do i update my nvidia driver? and how do i know the type of graphic card i have?
[08:28] <PMantis> diskus, Heh, mine is about 19GB.. ok, thanks.
[08:28] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: o.k., that link tells you how to do it...so where did you get stuck
[08:28] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: No I don't
[08:28] <Firefishe> CarCase928:  lshw can list a lot of hardware information; may need to be run as root
[08:28] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: Well, my guess would be that- or the command needs to access .gnupg as root, or the key is chmodded as root or the folder where the file is, or it tries to access something that it's for root user
[08:28] <CarCase928> firefishe: thanks
[08:28] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: have you tried with another key around?
[08:29] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: Tried the first command for Little Dapper 6.06, Package not found, etc.
[08:29] <Firefishe> CarCase928:  yw
[08:29] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: o.k. so it didn't connect, is it an option to try the router as WEP with no security, something simple just to test a basic connect?
[08:29] <hazarath> Dapper, howeve.
[08:29] <Zer0> Yes
[08:29] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: did you enable the repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list?  Did you do 'sudo apt-get update' after doing that to get the new indexes?
[08:29] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: I am going to disable my ethernet device aswell
[08:29] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: do that, that will rule out any driver issues etc
[08:30] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: Er... ok, what should I do first?
[08:30] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: ahh wait, were you still plugged into wired network?
[08:30] <Zer0> Kingsquak: I don't have wired connection on my linux box
[08:30] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: please read that link info, it explains it all there
[08:30] <Zer0> No can I get one
[08:30] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: ah o.k. good, it won't like being wired and trying to bring up wireless
[08:30] <Firefishe> DARKGuy:  Well, the file permissions issue isn't just with gpg.  I was having troubles with kde when I installed it two days ago (it is now uninstalled).  kde couldn't start because it--and the xserver attached to it--couldn't access any of the .kde files it needed to start up.  All I was getting was permission denied errors.
[08:31] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: Tried the first step, failed.
[08:31] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: Damn, then it's something messed up with permissions in your computer out of nowhere oO...
[08:31] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: and not by gpg or the key itself
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: you did this and it failed -> ?   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#what
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: you have to read and follow the restricted link exactly, you can't skip steps
[08:33] <PMantis> diskus, Do you know what happened to vi / vim with Edgy? I'm so use to typing 'vi' and actually getting vim...
[08:33] <Firefishe> DARKGuy:  well, I think it's been with me since I installed it.  This is a G4 PowerBook laptop, but permissions are still permissions and linux is still linux.  Still, everything in gnome works just fine with no problems.
[08:33] <Zer0> Ok in the GUI for GNOME it's showing just Wireless as enabled
[08:33] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: have you tried forcing your home directory permissions to your user?  Sometimes if you run sudo with apps it will foul that up
[08:33] <Firefishe> DARKGuy:  Well, I could not generate the key.  It can't access the random_seed file in the .gnupg subdirectory in my home directory,.
[08:34] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: as in 'sudo -i'  then  'chown -R youruser:youruser /home/youruser'
[08:34] <DARKGuy> Firefishe: Weird o.o; try what Kingsqueak says
[08:34] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  That sounds about right.  Let me try that.
[08:34] <mitrick> i got a good question here
[08:34] <mitrick> i got an intel core 2 duo and its 64 bit
[08:34] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: it's a side effect of running via sudo, has fouled me up a few times
[08:34] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak: do I run sudo -i and the other command on the same line?
[08:35] <mitrick> if i dl a 64 bit linux will it let me install and run other apps
[08:35] <mitrick> 32 bit
[08:35] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: no, sudo -i first, makes you root, then the other command once you're root
[08:35] <Firefishe> k...let me do that
[08:35] <Firefishe> thanks again
[08:35] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: you'll want to log totally out of KDE after that and log back in
[08:35] <hazarath> Kingsqueak: Sorry, got it now... it's installing.
[08:35] <Hirvinen> mitrick: Yes, you will have to set up a 32 bit chroot environment for those. Search the Ubuntu wiki for step by step instructions.
[08:36] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: Still nothign
[08:36] <Kingsqueak> hazarath: it's all there ;-) you just have to be patient and thorough
[08:36] <fek> moin
[08:36] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: hmm what wireless card do you have?   Maybe doublecheck the drivers for it
[08:36] <mitrick> ah
[08:36] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: WEP with no security should have been a 'gimme'
[08:37] <Zer0> hum
[08:37] <mitrick> so natively if i go on gaim.sf.net get the source code and compile gaim wont run?
[08:37] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: err sorry , no security heh, not WEP
[08:37] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  I uninstalled *all* of kde last night.  It isn't playing well with my system.  I still have all the .deb files in the cache, but I have some nasty dependency problems centering around some packages I need to iron out.  I have most of kde ready, it's just the permissions and the xserver and the... ;)
[08:37] <Zer0> I might get disconnected for a minute here
[08:37] <Zer0> I am connected via Wireles
[08:37] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  Besides, gnome is growing on me ;)
[08:37] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: yeah it sounds like something went a bit off during the install
[08:38] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: when you do  'sudo apt-get update'  then  'sudo apt-get upgrade'  do you get all sorts of warnings or packages held back?
[08:38] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: when you installed kde did you just install  kubuntu-desktop ?
[08:39] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  Initially, yes, then I used aptitude to install the *rest* of kde ;) hee.
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: hmm shouldn't have had dependency issues there
[08:40] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  I just chown'd my home directory the way you said.  Now let me try running gpg as a normal user.  Thanks for the sudo -i, I'm going to use it regularly now. :)
[08:40] <noodles12> Is there a linux program that can easily help make slide shows with pictures/video clips?
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: the -i is handy as it puts you in /root as root, helps to keep root from tainting permissions in your home dir sometimes
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> I'm used to -s and that causes some trouble
[08:41] <bony> i just now saw the bug #66702 its about mysql since i upgrade my system from dapper to edgy mysql server is down. some one in the comments said that downgrading worked for him. how to downgrade mysql-5.0?
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: slideshows to play how?
[08:41] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  I will rmbr this.  I'm used to just using sux (when I'm in a gui session).
[08:42] <bony> i have been following this bug since it was raised
[08:42] <noodles12> i was thinking of putting them on a cd/dvd or on an sd card to play in a digial picture frame
[08:42] <noodles12> the picture frame can play mp3's, mpg/avi/ or just load a bunch of jpg's into it's own slideshow thing
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: there are DVD authoring packages, I forget the names offhand though
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: kmediafactory may be one to look at
[08:43] <Zer0> brb
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: I tried this but it was almost a year ago and most were very unstable packages, there may be some better ones by now
[08:44] <malt> Kingsqueak: you got cpanel on your site?
[08:44] <Firefishe> DARKGuy:  I usually just use apt-get to install things.  I'm getting that weird dependency issue with kde I mentioned.  Would you be so kind as to look at a pastebin of the bottom few lines of the output and critique it for me?
[08:44] <Zer0> ok I have it set with no security now however same issue
[08:44] <Kingsqueak> malt: heh I've told you a few times in /msg, no...my hosting provider has it but I never installed it
[08:44] <noodles12> Kingsqueak: thanks. dvd authoring, is that slideshows/movies to dvd?
[08:44] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: basically, yeah
[08:45] <malt> Kingsqueak: sorry i havent got no messages from you
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> noodles12: means laying out a DVD for playback
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> malt: the channel may be doing some weird blocking or something
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> this IRC server is all weird that way
[08:45] <noodles12> Kingsqueak: that is awesome. but also is there a slideshow program similar to that in ilife? because i'm not sure if i'm playing it in dvd or in that picture frame.
[08:45] <malt> your nick identifyed?
[08:45] <malt> to pm
[08:45] <malt> or talk in pm
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> should be, lemme check
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> weird, maybe they restarted services
[08:46] <Kingsqueak> it wasn't id'd
[08:47] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: Removed Security and reconfigured teh wireless device to just connect and still no dice
[08:48] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: hmm I'm out of guesses, it's likely a driver issue I would suspect
[08:48] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: no chance you installed another wireless manager like wifi-radar and that's running?  You can't have two going or they interfere
[08:49] <spar> hi all
[08:49] <hakan> hey guys!
[08:49] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: When I preform a ifconfig -a the device wlan0 device indicates UP BROADCAST MULTICAST
[08:49] <spar> hakan
[08:49] <hakan> i have a makefile to compile my project
[08:49] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: yeah but I'm not sure why it isn't otherwise working
[08:49] <Zer0> I attempted to install Network Manager however I never was able to make the MAKE file
[08:49] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: it's a package, apt-get would install that
[08:49] <hakan> but what it really does is to call a batch file with some commands in it
[08:50] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: 'sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome'   though in Edgy it's already installed by default
[08:50] <hakan> when i call the batch file (called runme) as "source runme"
[08:50] <hakan> everything is allright
[08:50] <Zer0> Kingsqueak: Link encap:Ethernet ... on wlan0
[08:50] <hakan> but when i try "./runme" (it has ex. privs.)
[08:50] <hakan> it cannot
[08:50] <Zer0> What i the sit0 device?
[08:51] <hakan> have any idea?
[08:51] <Kingsqueak> Zer0: that's the IPV6 over IPV4 tunnel, it's normal
[08:54] <Zer0> Only thing i can see that looks wierd is that iwconfig indicates that wlan0 is Managed on 2.467GHZ  and teh Access PointL Invalid
[08:54] <Zer0> iwlist scan shows that it can see my network
[08:57] <abo> hakan, when you do "ls -l ./runme" what do you get?
[08:59] <xzk> I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my new laptop - the LiveCD works fine, but it won't let me resize my WindowsXP Partition :( can any of you help me out?
[08:59] <moztav> lol frogfoot.net
[08:59] <moztav> xzk: you need an alternative livecd to resize your windows partition
[08:59] <moztav> gparted doesn't seem to have that functionality
[08:59] <xzk> yes it does
[09:00] <hakan> what is a GNU makeinfo
[09:00] <xzk> it just doesn't work
[09:00] <moztav> xzk: www.google.com ;)

[09:01] <nashaw> if i have ide=nodma as a startup option in grub does it effect performance?
[09:02] <klasher>  goodnight, ;)
[09:02] <xzk> moztav: you still there?
[09:03] <xzk> can anyone else help me out.. looks like my helper went afk
[09:03] <link_36p> My nfs network shares dont work at all, where can i find help on this topic?

[09:09] <pibarnas> Could anyone make wmv9 files work on Ubuntu Edgy amd64?!?
[09:10] <A[D] minS> after i installed bcm4400-source , is there something else i have to do ?
[09:10] <nashaw> i have to use ide=nodma as a start up otion in grub for ubuntu to load, does any body know what this means or does?
[09:11] <fyrestrtr> nashaw: disables dma (direct memory access), which makes disk read/write operations slow.
[09:11] <fyrestrtr> I think its direct memory addressing, not access. Not sure.
[09:12] <nashaw> so doing ide=nodma could be what is making ubuntu slow for me?
[09:12] <fyrestrtr> nashaw: most likely, yes.
=== siXy is now known as siXy-away
[09:12] <fyrestrtr> nashaw: but its strange that dma for your hardware is not compatible. Is it a very old machine?
[09:14] <nashaw> no it is not an old machine
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> what chipset is your motherboard?
[09:14] <fyrestrtr> what are the specs? how much ram? how much swap?
[09:15] <JAMMAN2110> hmm
[09:15] <nashaw> i got amd x2 4200, 2 gigs of ram
[09:15] <nashaw> the othere stuff not sure
[09:18] <fyrestrtr> nashaw: did the desktop cd work okay for you?
[09:19] <JAMMAN2110> I was just curious, does anyone here have any points i should mention other than sticking it to MS?
[09:19] <nashaw> no, unless i used ide=nodma
[09:19] <nashaw> i have the same problem with kubuntu as well
[09:19] <JAMMAN2110> well guess not
[09:19] <JAMMAN2110> Night all!
[09:19] <JAMMAN2110> :)
[09:22] <nashaw> also, i need not need it to boot ubuntu 6.06 with the 386 kernel
[09:23] <link_36p> anyone know why my samba shares arent working?
[09:23] <nashaw> but i wanted to take advantage of the dual core so I went with a smp kernel and it did not work(except with ide=nodma)
[09:24] <Sasch> can help me with ubuntu mdadm ??
[09:25] <DARKGuy> Hm, anybody knows if I can set a different DPI for another display set in xorg.conf ?
[09:25] <fyrestrtr> nashaw: what kind of disks do you have? Are they SATA?
[09:26] <Casanova> I had a power cut and now I am not able to boot into X
[09:26] <Casanova> the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is intact
[09:26] <Casanova> does any one have any clues?
=== noodles12 is now known as Comatose
[09:26] <Firefishe> I'm trying to install all of kde using 'apt-get install kde*' as root.  I receive the following error: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/K2pUJx75.html
[09:26] <nashaw> the one with ubuntu on it is not..
[09:27] <nashaw> maybe this is the problem.. maybe i should install ubuntu onto the sata disk
[09:27] <DARKGuy> Casanova: What does /var/log/Xorg.0.log say?
[09:27] <Casanova> DARKGuy: 1 minute.. let me check
[09:27] <DARKGuy> Casanova: use www.pastebin.ca for pasting the log
[09:28] <Comatose> is kino a very beginner friendly video editting tool for ubuntu?
[09:28] <fyrestrtr> Firefishe: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop might work better.
[09:29] <Casanova> DARKGuy: http://prashblog.com/files/Xorg.0.log

[09:29] <DARKGuy> Casanova: Whoops, forgot about that xD it's okay, let me check ;)
[09:29] <Casanova> thanks :)
[09:30] <Casanova> DARKGuy: I have a 865 Intel motherboard by the way
[09:31] <Storkme> how come if i use a command to mount a samba fs it works fine but if i put it in /etc/fstab it gives me an error when i log in to X... the error is 'unable to initialize HAL!' (using ubuntu) and i need to comment out the line in /etc/fstab and reboot in order to log in... the line in /etc/fstab is as follows: //192.168.0.3/Group /media/debsrv      smbfs   username=alex,password=XXXXXX,user,auto 0 0
[09:31] <DARKGuy> Casanova: I see... no errors either - not one of those that say that can't start the X server oO...
[09:32] <Firefishe> fyrestrtr:  well, here's the rub:  I could do that, but since I already have all the .deb files cached, all it does is install kubuntu-desktop, kdm, and kubuntu-default-desktop or something like that.  The dependency problems remain.
[09:32] <Casanova> DARKGuy: its really odd.. i mean i couldnt shutdown properly once (due to the power cut) and X stops working :|
[09:32] <corevette> how do i find my second hard drive?
[09:33] <fyrestrtr> corevette: disk manager / gparted will help you.
[09:33] <DARKGuy> Casanova: Weird... what's the Driver parameter in the Device section of your xorg.conf ?
[09:34] <DARKGuy> Casanova: I think that maybe using a generic one might give you some X where you can debug the problem?
[09:34] <Casanova> DARKGuy: wtf!!! xserver-xorg was gone mysteriously :o
[09:34] <DARKGuy> Casanova: wtf oO
[09:34] <Sasch> can help me with ubuntu mdadm ??
[09:34] <Casanova> DARKGuy: whew works now :-) I removed xserver-xorg-vmware ... could that be a  reason?
[09:35] <corevette> fyrestrtr where is the disk manager
[09:35] <Casanova> brb on Xchat :-)
[09:35] <DARKGuy> Casanova: Maybe, that was weird because the log was correct and no errors there oO
[09:36] <barata> hallo, what quickcam WORKS with linux?
[09:36] <barata> is logitech okey?
[09:37] <Kingsqueak> barata: I just bough a cheap Logitech Quickcam Messenger, it works if you install the gspca driver
[09:37] <barata> Kingsqueak, what's the model? Logitech has a sale
[09:37] <DARKGuy> Casanova: welcome back :P
[09:37] <user__> the question is, does it work correctly?

[09:37] <Casanova> DARKGuy: thank you :-) GNOME has never felt so good
[09:37] <gimmulf_> How do i wget all .bmp images from a certain adress?
[09:37] <barata> thanks fhrestrtr
[09:37] <DARKGuy> Casanova: Hehe, it -is- good too ;)
[09:38] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  It's when I do an 'apt-get install kde*'
[09:38] <DARKGuy> Casanova: Glad you got back into X =)
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: ah, if you remove the kerberos stuff that will go away
[09:38] <Kingsqueak> heimdal-kdc
[09:39] <Kingsqueak> unless you have some reason to need that, don't install a kdc
[09:39] <Kingsqueak> barata: one sec I'll look it up
[09:39] <corevette> is it normally for flash to have no sound like on google video/you tube
[09:39] <fyrestrtr> gimmulf_: there is an example that shows exactly how to do that in the wget manual page.
[09:39] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  Ahhh...so just do something akin to 'apt-get remove kerberos?
[09:40] <Firefishe> !kerberos
[09:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kerberos - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:40] <Kingsqueak> barata: ah, it's not listed, likely it's the quickcam 'chat' but I don't want to tell you that and have it not work, the drivers are very specific
[09:40] <fyrestrtr> Firefishe: believe me, if you need kerberos, you will know what it is for ;) If you don't know what it is, you don't need it.
[09:40] <Kingsqueak> barata: I got this one for $29 from a Target store
[09:40] <avalon> I've got an XFS drive and a EXT3 drive. My XFS is my storage device and my EXT drive is my primary drives. Problem is my storage drive and my regular drive are both nearly full, so I need to do some housecleaning. I started on my EXT drive and tried to go on to the XFS drive. Neither of them actually remove files though. They'll show the files getting deleted, be really slow with the progress screen, and then they'll appaer in the trashcan. I'll empty it
[09:40] <avalon> and still have the same folder on the hard drive full. I went through console and tried, and even KDE su ed in Konqueror but all have the same effect. The files are read write access to everyone. What's wrong?
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: apt-get remove heimdal-kdc
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: then try the update/upgrade again
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: also apt-get remove kerberos4kth-kdc
[09:42] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak: Update before installing kde? (It's currently uninstalled)
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: get those two packages removed, then try installing kde again
[09:42] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  but after removing of those other files?
[09:42] <Firefishe> k
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: update pulls down the index files, if you've done it recently you're probably current with that
[09:42] <barata> okey Kingsqueak .... I'm in SF, there is no Target around here
[09:42] <Firefishe> then update after installing kde?
[09:42] <barata> but CompUSA has a sale right now
[09:43] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  Any problem with having multiverse/backports enabled?
[09:43] <dawkirst> Hi. Can I open CHM documents in Ubuntu?
[09:43] <Kingsqueak> barata: I would read up on the usb cams shown as supported and buy one that is an exact match, I thought they were more universally supported and found they aren't and just got lucky with mine
[09:43] <barata> Kingsqueak: what app do you use with that?
[09:43] <barata> gnome-conference?
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> barata: works with Ekiga and most anything else I've tried it with
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> barata: basically they either work or not and the apps will find them if they work
[09:44] <barata> I know Kingsqueak, I just do NOT want to buy an incompatible hardware and get all the headache down the road
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: no problem, it's handy
[09:44] <barata> I'm installing ekiga now
[09:45] <barata> who knows it has a list of compatible hardware
=== _ChaKy__ is now known as _ChaKy_
[09:47] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  I just did apt-get remove on heimdal-kdc and kerberos4kth-kdc and it says they're not installed.
[09:48] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: o.k. somewhere, maybe in aptitude or synaptic they are selected to install, unselect them
[09:48] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: however you are doing the install command
[09:48] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  and that means?
[09:49] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  I'll check synaptic et al
[09:49] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: whatever you are doing to do the kde install, just don't ask to install those two kerberos packages for the kdcs and it should work
[09:49] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: a kdc is a kerberos authentication server...likely you don't want/need that
[09:50] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: you may be asking for some whacky user database something or other that is bringing in those kdc packages, something to look for
[09:51] <Firefishe> I'm doing an 'apt-get install kde*' to get each and every kde file there is (and I have them all, pretty much).  Is there any way to eliminate just those two files on the command line in the apt-get syntax?
[09:52] <barata> all right folk, this thing works!
[09:52] <barata> see review: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Quickcam-Notebooks-Deluxe-camera/dp/B0009J5B9M
[09:52] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: lol, I would say slow down a bit, and use synaptic or aptitude and just pick what you want instead
[09:52] <barata> CompUSA has this tiny little toy for only $59
[09:52] <barata> not bad ....:)
[09:53] <A[D] minS> sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware bcmwl5.sys

[09:53] <A[D] minS> any idea?
[09:56] <phpnuborn> how do i stop the gui from automatically loading at bootup?
[09:56] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:  Hee, I understand.  I've been around linux for a bit now.  I run Debian 3.1 on another machine.  I already have all of the packages I need for a full kde install with the works.  I just need to work around these specific dependencies.
[09:56] <dogfood2006_> phpnuborn: you have to disable the splash screen
[09:57] <Kingsqueak> Firefishe: yeah you found some dusty corner there with one of the apps
[09:57] <dogfood2006_> phpnuborn: go to /boot/grub/menu.lst vi into it and remove any instance of 'splash' in that flat file, save the file and restart
[09:57] <dogfood2006_> you should be home free
[09:57] <Firefishe> Kingsqueak:   yes, well, I usually just use aptitude.  It's just nice to see what apt-get gives you on that nice CLI ;)
[09:57] <phpnuborn> no.. the xfce gui
[09:57] <Firefishe> I mean synaptic
[09:58] <dogfood2006_> I've never used xfce, are you running xubuntu
[09:58] <phpnuborn> yes..
[09:58] <dogfood2006_> How is it by the way? Is it faster?
[09:58] <dogfood2006_> Why did you choose to run xubuntu?
[09:58] <phpnuborn> under vmware's vmserver
[09:58] <dogfood2006_> Do you pay for that?
[09:59] <Kingsqueak> xubuntu uses a bit less memory than Gnome of the regular Ubuntu
[09:59] <phpnuborn> it was part of the vm application i downloaded
[09:59] <Kingsqueak> it doesn't have all the glitz, but it's a very nice setup all the same
[09:59] <phpnuborn> no.. vmplayer and vmserver are free
[09:59] <dogfood2006_> Cool I have to check those out.
[09:59] <avalon> does mono allow me to run .net applications in Ubuntu?
[09:59] <dogfood2006_> So you have to make a vmware image of xubuntu somehow to load it into memory correct?
[10:00] <phpnuborn> so the way this virtual machine application comes.. it like a pre-installed distro
[10:01] <codeshepherd> I am able to mount my CD.. but when i try to copy files from it.. (only large files) I get the Input/Output error .. dmesg reports the following .. http://pastebin.ca/259273
[10:01] <phpnuborn> once you create a 'virtual machine' with vmserver.. you install your distro
[10:02] <dogfood2006_> That is sweet, do I need the server version for that?
[10:02] <phpnuborn> or you download a distro already created..
[10:02] <phpnuborn> vmserver isn't very complex to install
[10:03] <barata> Kingsqueak: I'm not very much into webcaming ... anyway ... what app other than ekiga will work with it?
[10:03] <Firefishe> When doing 'apt-get install filename' is there a way to indicate that certain files are not to be installed?
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> barata: camorama just for taking pics
[10:03] <barata> does skype work with that too?
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> barata: there are some other messengers too, gizmo maybe and hmm another one
[10:03] <Firefishe> Like in 'apt-get install kde* <nix this file>
[10:03] <fyrestrtr> codeshepherd: looks like a bad disc.
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> skype doesn't do video, not the linux client at least
[10:04] <barata> do you pay for ekiga Kingsqueak?
[10:04] <avalon> is it even possible to run an MS.net exe file in linux through wine?
[10:04] <Kingsqueak> barata: nah it's free
[10:04] <barata> okey
[10:04] <Kingsqueak> barata: I don't use it heavily, it was mostly to play around
[10:04] <phpnuborn> so ignoring the vm stuff which doesn't apply here..   how do i stop a whatever GUI from auto-loading in xubuntu/unbuntu ?
[10:04] <barata> me too
[10:04] <Kingsqueak> I was playing with skype, Ekiga, wengophone, gizmo, xten softphone, linphone etc
[10:05] <fyrestrtr> phpnuborn: you could be more specific than 'whatever GUI'
[10:06] <oppinito> how do i "restart x3"?
[10:06] <oppinito> er, restart x
[10:06] <fyrestrtr> oppinito: ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:06] <Bubuzissimo> hi I'm installing ubunto for the first time
[10:06] <dogfood2006_> It's called 'bouncing' the X, paraphrase it that way, you will sound much cooler :-D
[10:06] <Bubuzissimo> which should be the swap and root file systems?
[10:06] <fyrestrtr> oppinito: or from a terminal (ctrl+alt+f1) sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[10:07] <fyrestrtr> Bubuzissimo: just let it automatically partition for you, it will take care of it.
[10:07] <Bubuzissimo> just run the install?
[10:07] <dogfood2006_> fyrestrtr: that is a long way of doing it, but now I know what dm is i guess
[10:08] <fyrestrtr> dogfood2006_: what is the short way?
[10:08] <dogfood2006_> starting X? ctrl alt backspace
[10:08] <n1gke> dogfood2006_, Yeh
[10:08] <fyrestrtr> 12:06 < oppinito> er, restart x
[10:08] <fyrestrtr> 12:06 < fyrestrtr> oppinito: ctrl+alt+backspace
[10:09] <dogfood2006_> fyrestrtr: that's what you asked me right?
[10:09] <MikeyMike> how do you view disk usage
[10:09] <MikeyMike> in console
[10:10] <MikeyMike> i always forget this one
[10:10] <fyrestrtr> MikeyMike: df -h
[10:10] <MikeyMike> YESSSSSSS
[10:10] <MikeyMike> df -h
[10:10] <MikeyMike> thank you :D
[10:10] <kandinski> I have updated to edgy and my computer (toshiba m200) does not recover well from suspend now: X doesn't draw when I come out of suspend. Any fix?
[10:10] <fyrestrtr> df = disk free
[10:10] <MikeyMike> gotcah
[10:10] <MikeyMike> i wont forget now.......
[10:10] <dogfood2006_> MikeyMike relax bro
[10:10] <MikeyMike> dogfood2006_, i am relaxed
[10:10] <MikeyMike> :)
[10:10] <fyrestrtr> kandinski: do you have an ati video card?
[10:10] <kandinski> fyrestrtr: nvidia card
[10:10] <dogfood2006_> Ok, you were starting to cover up my screen there
[10:11] <phpnuborn> don't all gui's get started with startx ?   so what does it matter which gui i'm using.. aren't they all treated the same.. in some standard way?
[10:11] <MikeyMike> dogfood2006_, it will clear up soon :)
[10:11] <fyrestrtr> kandinski: you might want to install the drivers for it, it helps with this kind of stuff.
[10:11] <dogfood2006_> Good to know, thanks for the consolence
[10:11] <kandinski> fyrestrtr: thanks
[10:11] <MikeyMike> dogfood2006_, of course :) :)
[10:11] <fyrestrtr> phpnuborn: no, a login manager starts different sessions. startx is just a script to start a minimal WM.
[10:12] <phpnuborn> so if a gui starts up generic.. shouldn't stoping them from auto-loading at boot time be generic?
[10:13] <fyrestrtr> phpnuborn: sure, just change the run level, or remove the login manager from your startup scripts.
[10:13] <phpnuborn> ok.. i see *nix world is still rough around the edges..
[10:14] <fyrestrtr> ok.. I see you are new to the *nix world.
[10:15] <dogfood2006_> If I run vmwareserver, I can have more than one distribution virtualized correct?
[10:15] <osfameron> fyrestrtr: a name like "phpnuborn" and you think he's trying to hide that? ;-)
[10:16] <fredl> dogfood2006_, yes.
[10:16] <fyrestrtr> dogfood2006_: yes, as long as you have the diskspace for it.
[10:16] <fredl> and the memory :)
[10:16] <BlackHawk> moin
[10:16] <fyrestrtr> you can have as many as you like -- just how many you run at once makes the difference ;)
[10:16] <phpnuborn> in my dos/win 3.1 days..  it was a lot more simple..  win  started it.. file>exit    exited it.. 1 simple edit to a standard file called autoexec.bat.. you were done..  login scripts.. i have to track more than 1 start up file?   oh yea.. *nix is so much better..
[10:16] <dogfood2006_>  I dont have to run all of them simultaneously
[10:17] <dogfood2006_> I'd like to try out xubuntu, edubuntu, fedora, and rhel
[10:17] <fyrestrtr> phpnuborn: do you have a question, or are you just ranting? :)
[10:17] <fredl> dogfood2006_, in that case vmware is probably perfect for what you're trying to do.
[10:17] <dogfood2006_> Cool beans!
[10:17] <fredl> dogfood2006_, an interesting thing to remember btw is that for a lot of 'appliances' VMware has images readily available.
[10:18] <phpnuborn> and what was that file name i need to edit?
[10:18] <Firefishe> How does one change the startup splash screen?  ie, from ubuntu to kubuntu and back again? ;)P
[10:18] <Firefishe> ;) rather
[10:18] <dogfood2006_> Where do I get these images?
[10:18] <fredl> such an appliance image you just download, enable in vmware, and *click* you have it up and running.
[10:18] <phpnuborn> to stop xfec loading?
[10:18] <Bubuzissimo> one question please
[10:18] <fredl> dogfood2006_, vam.vmware.com
[10:18] <neobyte420> hey room
[10:18] <phpnuborn> dogfood2006_, go to www.vmware.com
[10:19] <Bubuzissimo> should swap be primary partition or extended?
[10:19] <neobyte420> i need some networking help
[10:19] <fredl> (vam = virtual appliance marketplace)
[10:19] <dogfood2006_> I'm assuming I'll have to get my networking bridged as well correct? I'll have to create a network bridge perhaps?
[10:19] <neobyte420> is there anyone here that knows about the firestarter firewall?
[10:19] <phpnuborn> they have menu for free vm products
[10:19] <neobyte420> im trying to share my internet connection to my lan...but it keeps failing to start
[10:20] <fredl> dogfood2006_, that's all in vmware. You can either set up a virtual network within the vmware env. or make it bridge to a real network IP
[10:20] <neobyte420> can someone plz help
[10:20] <Spee_Der> !ask
[10:20] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:20] <neobyte420> I set my eth1 ip to a static
[10:20] <fyrestrtr> Bubuzissimo: you can only have 4 primary partitions. Make it a primary.
[10:20] <neobyte420> im not sure if im using the right ip for the gateway though
[10:21] <Spee_Der> !pastbin | neobyte420
[10:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about pastbin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:21] <Spee_Der> !pastebin | neobyte420
[10:21] <ubotu> neobyte420: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[10:22] <Spee_Der> neobyte420: Put it there so people can look at it for you and possibly advise.
[10:22] <Spee_Der> neobyte420: Then come here and post the url so we can find it.
[10:22] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: firestarter can help you with that.
[10:22] <neobyte420> Spee_Der, im using firestater...
[10:22] <fyrestrtr> !info firestarter
[10:22] <ubotu> firestarter: gtk program for managing and observing your firewall. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 383 kB, installed size 1884 kB

[10:22] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:23] <neobyte420> fyrestrtr, do you know about how i can solve my issue
[10:23] <neobyte420> maybe i just need to upgrade
[10:23] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: what is the problem exactly?
[10:23] <barata> anybody uses "LaCie LightScribe Labeler for Linux"???
[10:23] <eepberries> alright. i've messed up my xserv configuration and now it isn't starting up
[10:24] <eepberries> how can i fix it?
[10:24] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:24] <eepberries> what will this do?
[10:24] <Spee_Der> eepberries: You mean you fouled your xorg.conf ?
[10:24] <user__> Why can't I add a user with a CAPITAL Letter. Joe
[10:24] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: reconfigure it :)
[10:24] <eepberries> spee yeah i think. i was adding wacom support
[10:24] <Lynoure> !anybody | barata
[10:24] <ubotu> barata: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:24] <Spee_Der> eepberries: In terminal mode do this.
[10:24] <eepberries> and then when i restarted xserv, it wouldn't load right
[10:24] <dogfood2006_> Anyone use fedora 6 in here?
[10:25] <Spee_Der> eepberries: cd /etc/X11
[10:25] <fyrestrtr> dogfood2006_: probably lots of folk in #fedora do.
[10:25] <eepberries> how do i get it in terminal mode?
[10:25] <neobyte420> fyrestrtr, when i go to preferences to nettwork settings there is a create new DHVP configuration option...i select it and accept but it gives me a error
[10:25] <Spee_Der> eepberries: sudo cp xorg.conf.backup xorg.conf
[10:25] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: what error?
[10:25] <Spee_Der> eepberries: The use the ctrl+alt+backspace to resart x, if you do have a xorg.conf.backup that is.
[10:25] <eepberries> when i restarted my computer, a blue screen asks me if i want to see the error log or something, then after that i can't do anything
[10:26] <dogfood2006_> Yeah, I might take a gander there, I'd be interested in getting an ubuntu users' opinion on fedora, advantages, disadvantages, etc..
[10:26] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: what was the last thing you did before you computer restarted?
[10:26] <eepberries> it's a black screen that ends with "running local boot scripts"
[10:26] <Spee_Der> Right, it dumps you to terminal mode so you can log in
[10:26] <fyrestrtr> dogfood2006_: #ubuntu-offtopic for that.
[10:26] <eepberries> spee it doesn't let me enter anything in
[10:26] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: you have to login
[10:26] <dogfood2006_> fyrestrtr, good call
[10:26] <neobyte420> it tells me that it fail to start the firewall...a unkown error occurred...and that i should check my network device settings amd make sure my internet connection is active
[10:26] <eepberries> how do i do that
[10:26] <Spee_Der> you hvae to login with user name then root password
[10:26] <eepberries> but i never get a chance to log in
[10:26] <fyrestrtr> Spee_Der: what?
[10:26] <Spee_Der> once there you can cd /etc/X11
[10:27] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: hit ctrl+alt+f2 -- you should get a login prompt. Type your username, hit enter, type your password, hit enter.
[10:27] <eepberries> alright
[10:27] <neobyte420> fyrestrtr, any ideas on how to get this up and running?
[10:27] <Spee_Der> fyrestrtr: I've been going through that all weekend with trying to add 2nd monitor to dual head video card, finally got it working.
[10:27] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: not sure to be honest, I always did it "manually"
[10:27] <josh_> hi, does anyone know what tuner i can use to listen to a radio station (listen.pls)
[10:28] <fyrestrtr> josh_: sudo aptitude -r install streamtuner
[10:28] <Spee_Der> josh_: Try xmms ?
[10:28] <neobyte420> i had it working manually...but i want to use firestarter this time
[10:28] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: ... why? if it works, leave it be.
[10:28] <neobyte420> could it just be a bug in the software?
[10:28] <Spee_Der> josh_: I use streamtuner then select my ststion and use xmms to play.
[10:29] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: maybe. You'd have to check the website or LP
[10:29] <josh_> thanks ;)
[10:29] <neobyte420> becasue i want to beable to use my bittorrent
[10:29] <neobyte420> i was getting a NAT error
[10:29] <fyrestrtr> josh_: when you type sudo aptitude -r install streamtuner, it will install streamtuner (a browser for online radios) and xmms and another software for recording online radio.
[10:29] <eepberries> alright so i've done cd /etc/X11 now what?
[10:30] <josh_> ok i already had streamtuner
[10:30] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: that just means your ports aren't forwarded properly.
[10:30] <neobyte420> so i was going to use the firestarter firewall in steed of the manual settings to allow a port through
[10:30] <Bubuzissimo> one last question
[10:30] <josh_> thanks fyrestrtr ! :)
[10:30] <neobyte420> i dont know port forwarding to well yet
[10:30] <Spee_Der> eepberries: do a ls and see if you have a file named xorg.conf.backup
[10:30] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: if you want my suggestion, use shorewall :)
[10:30] <Bubuzissimo> how do I name the partitions in gparted?
[10:30] <Bubuzissimo> do I need to name them or I just create the partitions and make APLLY?
[10:30] <neobyte420> does shorewall have a dhcp setting to share out the internet over my lan?
[10:31] <eepberries> no there's only an xorg.conf, no xorg.conf.backup
[10:31] <fyrestrtr> Bubuzissimo: you don't name partitions (unless they are LVM volumes). Create then, hit apply, then mount them somewhere.
[10:31] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: yes, it can do that, but you need to setup a dhcp server first.
[10:31] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: also, just a warning -- there is no gui for shorewall, its all command line and text files.
[10:31] <neobyte420> :(
[10:31] <Spee_Der> eepberries: Ok. What did you do to mess the xorg.conf up ? You need to edit that file in order for X to start properly.
[10:32] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: but its dead easy to setup :)
[10:32] <neobyte420> will u help me plz fyrestrtr
[10:32] <eepberries> well, i was followin the tutorial for how to add wacom tools
[10:32] <neobyte420> ill get it
[10:32] <eepberries> let me look up what it said to do specifically
[10:32] <fyrestrtr> neobyte420: there are sample configurations on the shorewall.net website. Probably one that fits your situation perfectly.
[10:32] <Spee_Der> eepberries:While you are in /etc/X11 do a dir and see how many xorg.XXX.XXXXXXX files you might have
[10:33] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: ls xorg.*
[10:33] <eepberries> there's only the xorg.conf file
[10:33] <Spee_Der> ok
[10:33] <Spee_Der> fyrestrtr: tell eep how to do the reconfigure thingy please.
[10:33] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: just run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -- it will backup the file you have, create a new one, and then you can login to gnome.
[10:33] <Spee_Der> I can't remember not awake enough yet
[10:34] <eepberries> alright
[10:34] <Spee_Der> fyrestrtr: thanks
[10:34] <fyrestrtr> :)
[10:34] <eepberries> actually i want to write down the errors it was giving first
[10:34] <Spee_Der> eepberries: Smart move.
[10:34] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:34] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: that will give you errors
[10:34] <eepberries> alright
[10:35] <josh_> ok thanks, now i can listen to shoutcast servers that are predefined, how do i import a custom one? whenever i try, it keeps on trying to open a file or something
[10:36] <fyrestrtr> josh_: in streamtuner?
[10:36] <hazarath> Ok, tried to enable my Nvidia driver, says my X config has been altered... help?
[10:36] <josh_> fyrestrtr: yes, but it plays in xmss
[10:36] <fyrestrtr> josh_: yes, since streamtuner is not a player, just a browser/search engine.
[10:36] <uksprout> hi all
[10:36] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: read the wiki :)
[10:37] <josh_> ah, so how do i play a custom stream?
[10:37] <josh_> xmms?
[10:37] <neobyte420> ty fyrestrtr for the link..im reading up on it more
[10:37] <fyrestrtr> johns^: just add the url there, or open it directly in xmms.
[10:37] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: Er... sorry, long day... got the link? :/
[10:37] <dogfood2006_> Why does ubuntu use partition #5 as it's default swap parition?
[10:37] <fyrestrtr> !nvidia | hazarath
[10:37] <ubotu> hazarath: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:37] <dogfood2006_> It uses hda1 for it's primary, why not use hda2 for swap?
[10:38] <fyrestrtr> dogfood2006_: something you should ask in LP :)
[10:38] <dogfood2006_> Linux programmer?
[10:38] <fyrestrtr> launchpad -- the ubuntu bug tracker.
[10:38] <eepberries> oh man this reconfigure utility is complicated
[10:39] <dogfood2006_> I see, thanks.
[10:39] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: just answer the questions as best as you can, its quite liberal. Most of the time, you can just accept the default.
[10:40] <dogfood2006_> !wireless
[10:40] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:40] <phpnuborn> ctrl-alt-f1, then   sudo gdm stop   to stop the gui once started?
[10:40] <fyrestrtr> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[10:41] <uksprout> I am having some install probs:  I am getting "checking for SDL_Init in -lSDL... no
[10:41] <uksprout> " next line is "configure: error: SDL is required
[10:41] <uksprout> " I have searched on Ubuntu.org but cannot find a reference
[10:41] <eepberries> alright so now it's back to the command prompt. do i have to restart the computer?
[10:41] <fyrestrtr> phpnuborn: if you want to stop it permanently, you have two options. Either change the default run level (by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst) or take the display manager out of your startup scripts, by reading the man page for update-rc.d
[10:41] <phpnuborn> oh yea.. *nix can't figure out paths on its own..  thx for the reminder
[10:41] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: what are you installing?
[10:42] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: no, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[10:42] <Spee_Der> eepberries: no
[10:43] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: Did it step by step, says my X configuration has been altered.
[10:43] <uppal_> hello everyone
[10:43] <uppal_> can someone please help me
[10:43] <uppal_> i cannot get direct rendering to work
[10:43] <Bubuzissimo> thnks fyrestrtr
[10:43] <tom47> does anyone know why there is an edgy-proposed repository
[10:43] <uksprout> fyrestrtr: it is a game called orbital_eunuchs_sniper-1.30 this time, I have also tried a number of other programs and one or two are complaining of a missing cpp or that cpp fails sanity check
[10:43] <uppal_> sudo cp /lib/modules/`uname -r`/volatile/fglrx.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/fglrx.ko <-- this fails
[10:43] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: easy way to solve this is to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, change 'nv' to 'nvidia' and save it.
[10:44] <fyrestrtr> !compile | uksprout

[10:44] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: Er... sorry, how? x.x
[10:44] <tom47> !edgy-proposed
[10:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about edgy-proposed - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:44] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: Tried it once, apperntly it didn't save right.
[10:44] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:44] <Vich> my ubuntu splash screen colours are weird
[10:44] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: you have to open it with sudo because your normal user doesn't have rights to write to that file.
[10:45] <Vich> the ubuntu text is orange instead of white
[10:45] <uksprout> fyrestrtr: ok thanks will go read
[10:45] <Vich> and it's rather fuzzy
[10:45] <Vich> also, the major problem
[10:45] <Vich> the text is black instead of blue
[10:45] <Vich> or at least I'm assuming so since I can't read any of it
[10:45] <fyrestrtr> Vich: are you on edgy or dapper?
[10:45] <Vich> edgy
[10:45] <fyrestrtr> Vich: what text are you talking about?
[10:45] <Link9618> Is safe for me to use the "sudo" command while online?
[10:45] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: In said file: it says Driver: "nvidia'
[10:46] <Vich> well, on my other ubuntu system
[10:46] <hazarath> Not 'nv'
[10:46] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: it should say Driver "nvidia"
[10:46] <Link9618> And is it safe for me to open a program with the sudo command at leave it open while online?
[10:46] <Vich> I recall blue text, like press enter to restart, etc
[10:46] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: Ok, so, why is it not working? :s
[10:46] <Vich> I suppose it doesn't show often
[10:46] <Vich> but when it does, I'd like to read it
[10:46] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: for that you'll have to check the X log file (/var/log/Xorg.0.log)
[10:46] <hazarath> fyr "nvidia" rather
[10:47] <Link9618> is it?
[10:47] <eepberries> alright so i did sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start and it's still at the terminal view
[10:47] <fyrestrtr> Link9618: depends on the program
[10:48] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: hit ctrl+alt+f7
[10:48] <Link9618> How do I know?
[10:48] <eepberries> alright. it says the x server is now disabled and to disable it when configured
[10:48] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: you should see a blinking cursor, and then it should bring the logon screen (sometimes, it takes a bit). If it doesn't do that, then hit ctrl+alt+f2 and hit /etc/init.d/gdm stop -- and then check the log file for any error messages (grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
[10:49] <psicho> I cant find opera on synaptic even after i'd enabled the additional repos- used to be there in 6.01. Do i need additional repos to install opera?
[10:49] <hazarath> fyrestrtr: What am I looking for? I see no error status... [I.E. (EE)] 
[10:49] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: hit cltr+alt+f2, then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[10:49] <fyrestrtr> hazarath: pastebin it, or join #flood and paste the lines there.
[10:49] <tom47> does anyone know why -edgy-proposed exists as a repository?
[10:49] <hazarath> #flood
[10:49] <hazarath> ...
[10:50] <eepberries> fyre it looks like the reconfigure utility isn't actually saving anything
[10:50] <Spee_Der> fyrestrtr: Please send again the ee grep thing to see the error log, I forgot to write it down
[10:50] <fyrestrtr> psicho: the deb from the site works well.
[10:50] <eepberries> it's still giving the errors the same errors related to wacom stuff
[10:50] <psicho> OK, thanks.
[10:51] <Spee_Der> eepberries: When you edit the xorg.conf file, just put a # in front of the call for the wacom, to ignore it.
[10:51] <Spee_Der> eepberries: That's what I did.
[10:51] <dv5237> i got a 'Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950' in my notebook can i install a driver for it to get a better preformens in games ect?
[10:51] <eepberries> shouldn't the reconfigure thing overwrite it though? also, how can i edit the file?
[10:52] <fyrestrtr> Spee_Der: grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:52] <fyrestrtr> dv5237: sure

[10:55] <phpnuborn> some mentioned a package called  BUM ...  some kind boot manager.. anyone know about it?  i am thinking about installing it..

[10:56] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: yes, it will regenerate it.
[10:56] <Smotang> anyone know a linux solution to Ventrilo?
[10:56] <fyrestrtr> JNeverMind: edit /etc/apt/sources.list and put a # before the very first deb line.

[11:02] <Daviey> Hi guys, on boot-up, what is the first time i can call/run a program.  I have hoping i can do it during usplash, splash screen.  Any ideas?
[11:04] <kuja> Daviey: /etc/profile is a good place, I believe
[11:04] <Daviey> kuja, is that only run when the user logs in?
[11:05] <kuja> That's the global profile. It gets run once before anyone logs in
[11:05] <Daviey> kuja, i'm hoping to call the script earlier than that.  Thanks anyway
[11:06] <kuja> Daviey: You could, I just don't know how.
[11:06] <Daviey> kuja, cheers
[11:06] <kuja> Daviey: Just like the scripts in /etc/init.d, right?
[11:06] <fyrestrtr> Daviey: you can create the script, and just add it to a run level.
[11:07] <tanath> i have a wee problem. when i log in, it says "i have detected a gnome-panel already running and will now exit" or something to that effect.. only there's no gnome panel, and if i run it from the terminal, i get the same thing
[11:07] <kuja> Daviey: man update-rc.d
[11:07] <fyrestrtr> tanath: playing with XGL?
[11:07] <tanath> running edgy
[11:07] <tanath> fyrestrtr, no, beryl. was fine before though
[11:07] <eepberries> alright
[11:07] <Daviey> fyrestrtr, how can i add it to the run level?
[11:07] <dogfood2006_> Is there a shortcut to get a new terminal window up on ubuntu?
[11:07] <eepberries> i cannot figure out how to replace the broken xserver config file
[11:07] <dogfood2006_> shortcut key?
[11:07] <tanath> fyrestrtr, aiglx
[11:07] <kuja> Daviey: Read what I said :)
[11:08] <Daviey> kuja, cheers
[11:08] <brownie> hi
[11:08] <eepberries> i've tried deleting xorg.conf and usin gthe reconfigure utility, but it seems like the same problem keeps hapenning
[11:08] <eepberries> i keep getting the same errors
[11:08] <fyrestrtr> tanath: that sounds about right :) try your luck in #ubuntu-xgl
[11:08] <Daviey> kuja, i think that is what i want ;)
[11:08] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: what errors?
[11:08] <kuja> Daviey: =)
[11:08] <brownie> free internet anyone?
[11:09] <tanath> fyrestrtr, er, aiglx & xgl are two different things...
[11:09] <mr-russ> where can I find info on cross compiling packages for ubuntu?
[11:09] <eepberries> fyrestrtr: Failed to load module "wacom" (module requirement mismatch, 0)
[11:09] <fyrestrtr> tanath: its the same channel for both.
[11:09] <eepberries> followed by three instances of "No input driver matching 'wacom'"
[11:09] <tanath> i see
[11:09] <kuja> eepberries: I think it's okay to fail to load wacom :P
[11:09] <kuja> eepberries: Mine fails too, yet X always starts
[11:09] <eepberries> well it isn't starting anymore
[11:09] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: unless you have a wacom tablet, you can ignore those.
[11:09] <eepberries> yeah i do
[11:10] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: OH
[11:10] <eepberries> it worked before

[11:11] <eepberries> so fyrestrtr do you know anything about it?
[11:11] <mdasilva> hello
[11:12] <dogfood2006_> Is there a keyboard shortcut to get a terminal window to open?
[11:12] <amileft> install Apache2.2.3 from source but httpd can not start up automatic
[11:12] <kuja> !automatix | we2by
[11:12] <ubotu> we2by: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[11:12] <we2by> kuja, nah, don't like automatix
[11:12] <kuja> Wow, not the exact message I was expecting from that factoid lol
[11:12] <kuja> I used automatix, and it worked great for me. It even worked better for azureus than the azureus in the Ubuntu repos :P
[11:13] <fyrestrtr> it breaks more things than it fixes, and its also not supported.
[11:13] <amileft> install Apache2.2.3 from source but httpd can not start up automatic. And aft google I can not find help so I come here trouble you.
[11:13] <kuja> Well, that's all good. I took the risk I guess.
[11:14] <kuja> fyrestrtr: I'd rather have something I don't care about break than something I do care about not work.
[11:15] <fyrestrtr> kuja: you'll care when you can't login to your box :) but hey, see !WorksForMe
[11:15] <Link9618> Which programs or type of programs will pose a security risk if I use the sudo command to open it?
[11:15] <kuja> fyrestrtr: Haven't had the issue, the only thing similar to that is that sudo broke. Fixed it with a single command :)
[11:16] <phpnuborn> anyone here use ubuntu/xubuntu with  vmware's vmserver?
[11:16] <tahorg_> Link9618: every program that you're not sure about.
[11:16] <tanath> no joy. i don't think it's a driver or X problem...
[11:16] <Link9618> well tha't all of them
[11:17] <Link9618> that's
[11:17] <tahorg_> Link9618: so you have your answer. "All of them"
[11:18] <eepberries> so can anyone figure out why xserver won't start anymore? this is exactly what i did before it stopped working https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WacomTabletIssue
[11:19] <fek> eeboy: startx in a console and watch auf for errors
=== a is now known as cHiEf
=== cHiEf is now known as k0ray
[11:20] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: easiest way to get your server to start is to disable the wacom tablet device.
[11:20] <eepberries> how do i do that
[11:20] <drakeoutlaw> hi all can any bluetooth users help?
[11:22] <eepberries> fyrestrtr: how can i disable the wacom tablet?
[11:22] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: open up your xorg.conf , scroll down to the section "ServerLayout" put a # in front of the InputDevice for your wacom tablet, save the file, and restart X.
[11:22] <Dmole> Hi, anyone have an insight to "monitor Out of Range" problems?
[11:22] <eepberries> but how do i save it if i don't have permission to
[11:22] <fyrestrtr> Dmole: change you refresh rates.
[11:23] <kuja> eepberries: Remove wacom-tools and xserver-xorg-input-wacom and see what happens
[11:23] <fyrestrtr> eepberries: you open it with sudo
[11:23] <eepberries> kuja what would i enter into the terminal to do that
[11:23] <kuja> sudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-input-wacom wacom-tools
[11:24] <phpnuborn> i am in text mode.. i have an error message want to cut and paste to a text file...  can i do that some how?
[11:25] <kuja> eepberries: Then from your command line reconfigure your X, by typing: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:25] <roh> phpnuborn, you should be able to just use the mouse...
[11:25] <phpnuborn> so basically i want to copy from the text screen and paste to a text file..
[11:25] <phpnuborn> ok.. i'll try
[11:25] <roh> phpnuborn: When you move the mouse, do you see a moving cursor?
[11:26] <roh> phpnuborn: Left-drag to select, right-click to paste.
[11:26] <fyrestrtr> middle click to paste also work.
[11:26] <Eons> i need some help with nvidia driver 1.0-9629, everytime i use any app that requires fullscreen, X crashes
[11:26] <bookmac> how do you install the java plugin? i already tried downloading it and ln -s
[11:26] <fyrestrtr> !java
[11:26] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:27] <kuja> bookmac: Install the sun-java5-jre then type: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[11:27] <drakeoutlaw> Please help me to set up  bluetooth to send and receive files from my mobile phone
[11:27] <kuja> Then select the number to the sun-java5-jre
[11:27] <fyrestrtr> drakeoutlaw: install gnome-bluetooth (sudo apt-get install gnome-bluetooth)
[11:28] <drakeoutlaw> fyrestrtr yes did that and can receive from phone to PC but how do I send to phone from PC?
[11:29] <roh> phpnuborn: If you're running a program and want to put its output into a file instead of on the screen, you don't even need a mouse
[11:29] <phpnuborn> all i get is the blinking underline cursor.. mouse has no functions..
[11:29] <eepberries> fyrestrtr: alright i don't see anything related to the wacom under ServerLayout in the xorg.conf. it mentions it elsewhere in the file though
[11:30] <kuja> eepberries: Did you do what I say? heh
[11:30] <bookmac> kuja> after typing what you said I got: There is only 1 program which provides java
[11:30] <bookmac> (/usr/bin/gij-wrapper-4.1). Nothing to configure.
[11:30] <eepberries> kuja yes
[11:30] <eepberries> it still isn't working
[11:30] <roh> phpnuborn: The mouse needs something called "gpm" to work in text mode -- I guess you don't hae it installed.
[11:30] <phpnuborn> oh.. yea..  redirect screen output to a file
[11:30] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: IIRC, you may use gnome-obex-server
[11:30] <infest> phpnuborn, are you trying to boot ubuntu, under vmware?
[11:31] <infest> phpnuborn, like ubuntu as a GuestOS
[11:31] <phpnuborn> xubuntu is booting just fine under vmware
[11:31] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: indeed, gnome-obex-server will let you receive files sent from other bluetooth devices
[11:32] <phpnuborn> i mean.. vmserver
[11:32] <infest> phpnuborn, On *phyisical hard drive" ?
[11:32] <phpnuborn> i think i got what i need
[11:32] <Eons> it will stay on your notify area as a blue antenna icon, and it will popup a window when a phone is sending something to ya
[11:32] <infest> can you post the link please, I'm trying to figure that out
[11:33] <eepberries> alright the error log file is still saying the error "could not open default font 'fixed'"
[11:33] <eepberries> uh, is this really a problem?
[11:33] <infest> phpnuborn, you need a bootable floppy or *.img to do so
[11:34] <tanath> i need some help. i can't get gnome-panel running. it's in my startup apps, but not in my current session. if i try to run it, it says it's detected one already running and exits
[11:34] <kuja> tanath: Did you try restarting X?
[11:34] <tanath> kuja, yep
[11:34] <eepberries> it's also saying "error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy"
[11:34] <tanath> kuja, it started when i logged out
[11:35] <misreckoning> I have ubuntu 6.06 and it works great, but on 6.10 it can't recognize my ethernet card :/
[11:36] <misreckoning> and can I upgrade my system to ubuntu 6.10 without reinstalling it ?
[11:36] <kuja> misreckoning: Just point your dapper repositories to edgy, yes
[11:36] <infest> misreckoning, don't try it
[11:36] <phpnuborn> ok.. i just tried     apt-get install bum  > errmsg.txt      but the error messages are going to  stderr i think.. so how would i redirect stderr to a file?
[11:37] <tanath> misreckoning, i upgraded with dist-upgraded months ago, with minimal probs, but others have had probs
[11:37] <infest> as if now, they 're fixing it
[11:37] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: Isn't obex-server installed when gnome bluetooth is installsed?
[11:38] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: uhm, i don't know
[11:38] <tanath> misreckoning, i think you just need to make sure you have at least, ubuntu-minimal installed
[11:38] <Eons> wait a minute, i'll do a check right now
[11:38] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: is there a GUI that will show the mobile's filesystem?
[11:39] <tanath> although it's not minimal enough for me :p
[11:39] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: this depends on your phone
[11:39] <Eons> mine doesn't support this feature, and I have no idea how to do it
[11:39] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: Nokia 6230
[11:39] <J_P> hi all
[11:39] <Eons> I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of howtos on the forum
[11:39] <misreckoning> tanath: what is ubuntu minimal?
[11:40] <misreckoning> infest: why not?
[11:40] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: yes, gnome-obex-server is in gnome-bluetooth
[11:40] <tanath> misreckoning, a meta-package that makes sure you have the basic necessities of ubuntu. i think the default is ubuntu-desktop which has more
[11:40] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: so obex-server will require command line to send file?
[11:40] <tanath> misreckoning, you'd have it unless you removed it
[11:41] <Werdnum> http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Image:UbuntuLogo2.png
[11:41] <Werdnum> lol
[11:41] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: do you need to send o receive?
[11:41] <becky> Hello, for some reason my Ubuntu Edgy setup I just installed is showing an additional floppy drive that never mounts. I only have 1 physical floppy drive, and that mounts OK. how to I get rid of the other one showing in "Computer"?
[11:41] <Eons> if you need to send, you'll use gnome-obex-send
[11:41] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: both
[11:41] <misreckoning> tanath: ok I have that
[11:41] <Eons> you'd like to create a shortcut
[11:41] <misreckoning> tanath: what are the edgy repos?
[11:41] <Eons> for gnome-obex-send
[11:41] <tanath> becky, i have that too, only i don't have a floppy drive.. o.O
[11:42] <Werdnum> ubuntu: linux for communists
[11:42] <misreckoning> tanath: I guess I should first remove old (6.06) repos?
[11:42] <Eons> so you can drag files on it and it will be easier to send files
[11:42] <kuja> Werdnum: Makes me wonder why I'm still using Ubuntu, lol
[11:42] <Werdnum> :DD
[11:42] <tanath> misreckoning, if you're editing sources.list just change instances of dapper to edgy
[11:42] <kuja> I've been meaning to switch, I've been sort of lazy :P
[11:42] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: create an app shortcut on your panel to gnome-obex-send
[11:42] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: Ok I get the idea now. Great!  Thank you very much
[11:42] <becky> tanath/anyone else - Any idea how to remove an item from the computer:/// directory then?
[11:42] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: another thing
[11:43] <Eons> open system -> preferences -> session  properties
[11:43] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: still listening
[11:43] <tanath> i need some help. i can't get gnome-panel running. it's in my startup apps, but not in my current session. if i try to run it, it says it's detected one already running and exits
[11:43] <Eons> go to the last tab
[11:43] <Eons> and add this program
[11:43] <Eons> "gnome-obex-server"
[11:43] <Eons> so everytime you open gnome
[11:44] <Eons> your pc will be ready to receive
[11:44] <Eons> it's better than doing it manually
[11:44] <Eons> =)
[11:44] <rob> Werdnum: don't troll!
[11:44] <tanath> this happens when i log in too
[11:44] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: Dude! you're the man (unless you're a girl) Thanks a mil
[11:44] <Eons> drakeoutlaw: np =P
[11:45] <misreckoning> tanath: ok I will do it manualy, thank you
[11:45] <Werdnum> rob: that is so not trolling
[11:45] <misreckoning> tanath:  I hope it won't break anything :P
[11:45] <Eons> bye!
[11:45] <Werdnum> rob: the pic is funny! http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Image:UbuntuLogo2.png
[11:45] <rob> Werdnum: yeah it is
[11:45] <Werdnum> rob: fine. I shall leave.
[11:46] <rob> saves me doing it I guess :)
[11:46] <tanath> misreckoning, maybe make a backup of sources.list
[11:46] <misreckoning> tanath: sure I will
[11:46] <tanath> misreckoning, you know how to edit files from the commandline/terminal?
[11:46] <web_knows> hi :)
[11:46] <misreckoning> tanath: yeah I know at least that much ;)
[11:46] <tanath> misreckoning, good to know if x breaks.
[11:46] <becky> Please, I know someone knows the answer to this one.
[11:46] <tanath> good
[11:47] <misreckoning> tanath: nano, vim, emacs :)
[11:48] <archis> Hi ppl - a question re. update-manager
[11:48] <tanath> misreckoning, btw, you done this before?
[11:48] <tanath> misreckoning, you use listbugs?
[11:48] <misreckoning> tanath: nope :/
[11:48] <archis> I updgraded to edgy without any problems but
[11:48] <tanath> misreckoning, i can't recall if it shows bugs by default
[11:49] <archis> I said no when it asked me to delete obsolete libs and stuff and the very end
[11:49] <misreckoning> tanath: bugs are possible? whyyyy :(
[11:49] <archis> because I was concerned it might remove a few things
[11:49] <tanath> misreckoning, but if it does, ignore them. you'll need to upgrade everything. and some bugs only show when some apps aren't updated
[11:49] <archis> that I had installed via dpkg -i and alien previously
[11:49] <misreckoning> tanath: ok who cares, I will try
[11:49] <tanath> misreckoning, heh. 99.999% of all apps have bugs
[11:49] <archis> perhaps that was a misplaced worry
[11:49] <misreckoning> tanath: when debian comes out I will wipe out ubuntu from my hdd ;)
[11:50] <archis> but in any case I want to get rid of the cruft
[11:50] <tanath> heh
[11:50] <archis> is there a command to go with update-manager to repeat that specific step
[11:50] <archis> or should I use Snyaptic (in on GNOME)
[11:51] <tanath> synaptic is good. you can add a custom filter to show orphaned packages
[11:52] <tanath> do that, archis
[11:52] <tanath> archis, there's also 'sudo apt-get autoremove'
[11:52] <archis> ok cool and the orphaned filter in synaptic works via deborpham is that right?
[11:52] <archis> deborphan
[11:52] <tanath> archis, but you can find more 'cruft' with a synaptic filter
[11:53] <tanath> yes
[11:53] <archis> ok and would that be libs only or all srots of things?
[11:53] <tanath> finds more than libs for me
[11:53] <tanath> mostly libs though
[11:53] <archis> (that I can safely remv)
[11:54] <tanath> but you don't have to remove everything
[11:54] <archis> and is synaptic smart enough to warn me if I try to throow soth out that I installed manually (locally)
[11:54] <archis> dependencies of local pkgs etc
[11:54] <tanath> archis, i'm pretty sure if you installed it manually it won't show in that filter
[11:55] <tanath> archis, deps don't show
[11:55] <archis> ok because there's also the 'local and obsolete' filter in synaptic
[11:55] <archis> I dont quite understand the meaning of obsolete vs local
[11:55] <tanath> archis, i don't know the details of how it works, but i've never had probs using it. though it's shown things i'm not sure i want to remove (decoder libs), but i just leave 'em
[11:56] <saimu0> My OPENOFFICE is all in LAO  and i want to change it to Chinese, can anyone help ?
[11:56] <tanath> archis, not to sure either
[11:56] <archis> hehe yeah I thought that these distinctions are quite esoteric for most
[11:56] <tanath> archis, i would guess local is locally installed (w/ dpkg) and obsolete is just not needed anymore
[11:57] <archis> hm yeah but I guess it would not be a good idea to touch any of that
[11:57] <tanath> archis, btw, if you install stuff with aptitude, it marks it so it knows you want that, and any deps installed for it get marked as autoremovable
[11:58] <tanath> archis, you can use it just like apt-get
[11:58] <tanath> archis, except it has 'aptitude reinstall' :)
[11:58] <archis> ok and can you remind what autoremove does
[11:59] <archis> I will use aptotude autoclean at the end
[11:59] <tanath> archis, removes automatically installed dependancies
[11:59] <archis> to get rid of unused deb archives
[11:59] <archis> ah ok
[11:59] <tanath> that aren't needed anymore
[11:59] <archis> ah cool and thats apt-get autoremove or aptitude autoremove
[12:00] <tanath> apt-get
[12:00] <tanath> possibly both
[12:00] <tanath> don't think so though
[12:01] <tanath> i need some help. i can't get gnome-panel running. it's in my startup apps, but not in my current session. if i try to run it, it says it's detected one already running and exits
[12:02] <soundray> Is there a way to calculate the mtime difference between a pair of files in minutes?
[12:02] <archis> thanks for helping tanath :)
[12:02] <tanath> np
[12:02] <tonyyarusso> tanath: Maybe it is actually running and you just don't have any panels enabled?  Try a right-click, "Add panel".  Had you deleted them before, or is this on a fresh install?
[12:03] <tanath> tonyyarusso, nope. not running
[12:03] <tanath> tonyyarusso, there's no panel to right-click on :p
[12:04] <tim__b> anyone into package building using pbuilder? i tried building an liferea package which needs mozilla-dev to be installed. i added the package to my dsc and also via pbuilder --extrapackage but via make install in pbuilder the script claims not to find mozilla-dev. any suggestions?
[12:04] <tanath> tonyyarusso, this is an upgrade from dapper. i wouldn't delete something  ieneded :p
[12:04] <tanath> *i needed. bloody cold fingers
[12:04] <tonyyarusso> tanath: Does anything show up in 'ps aux | grep gnome-panel'?
[12:04] <tanath> tonyyarusso, nope
[12:05] <tanath> wait a sec
[12:05] <tanath> there isn ow
[12:05] <soundray> tanath: I know I'm late in this, but have you tried Alt-F2 gnome-panel ?

[12:07] <tanath> muahaha
[12:07] <tanath> :D i'm a dumbass
[12:07] <tonyyarusso> what?
[12:07] <tanath> didn't show in current session, so i assumed it wasn't running
[12:08] <tanath> tonyyarusso, 'vim' = victory is mine
[12:08] <tonyyarusso> ah
[12:08] <tonyyarusso> So not the text editor then.
[12:08] <tanath> tonyyarusso, i ran 'killall gnome-panel' and ran it

[12:19] <mykal44> msg flox :)
[12:19] <mykal44> :)
[12:20] <soundray> jisatsu: hardly any vendor says what the chipset is on the package. The way to do it is to buy from a reseller who will give you your money back if you find out that it doesn't work.
[12:20] <jisatsu> yeah, I could do. I wanted to check out ones that are known to work first though
[12:20] <we2by> does gnome have sharing feature like kde?

[12:29] <vldmr> dmnd: its use qt
[12:29] <dmnd> vldmr: use sudo apt-get install blabla
[12:29] <soundray> vldmr: open a terminal and run 'sudo -i' for a root CLI. Use 'gksudo qtprogram' to run a graphical program with root privileges.
[12:29] <Vimmel> Where do i check who and what restarted my server?
[12:30] <willvdl> does libsensors come out the box with compiled sysfs support?

[12:34] <bimberi> floating: ftp or sftp are two ways (both require one of the PCs to be running a server process)
[12:34] <floating> I heard there was a program in ubuntu, you just enter ip and something
[12:35] <bimberi> floating: what operating system on the PCs
[12:35] <bimberi> ?
[12:35] <floating> but have no idea which, and can't locate it in xubuntu, so I am not sure if it is installed here
[12:35] <floating> windows on the other, and connecting with xubuntu
[12:35] <minimec> Hi folks. I just ripped an CD with Bamshee and made some Tags too. Now I realise, that the beep-media-player cannot read the tags correctly. I do wonder why that is... ?
[12:35] <Luke> anyone know a repo with nvidia beta drivers for Ubuntu edgy?
[12:35] <floating> at least from ubuntu I should be able to connect to windows machines shared folder with this program
[12:36] <tonyyarusso> !amaranth | Luke
[12:36] <ubotu> Luke: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://seerofsouls.com/ edgy contrib" (for x86) (key at http://seerofsouls.com/ubuntu.html) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[12:36] <Luke> i think thats down
[12:36] <Luke> oh i see
[12:36] <Luke> thanks tonyyarusso !
[12:36] <vldmr> dmnd: I have the root password but it dont work !! why ?
[12:36] <tonyyarusso> Luke: Most likely it is, but it's all I'm aware of.  They maxed out their alloted bandwidth.
[12:36] <bimberi> floating: yes, in Ubuntu you use nautilus, the file manager to connect to a shared folder on the WIndows PC (Places -> Connect to Server)
[12:36] <Kenas> hi guys i have just tried to install "Guild Wars" on ubuntu with wine and the result is fine...

[12:36] <Kenas> to fix this problem ??
[12:37] <tonyyarusso> Luke: Ohp, nvm.  The orig. one was down b/c of that, I see there are mirrors now.
[12:37] <floating> hmm ok, I dont have "places" in xubuntu, but ill just try installing nautilus then, thanks
[12:37] <Luke> tonyyarusso: yea thats why I said thanks... i wasnt aware of this mirror
[12:38] <Luke> tonyyarusso: someone is on top of things =)
[12:38] <tonyyarusso> Yep
[12:38] <Luke> whoever updated that with a mirror
[12:38] <willvdl> do the edgy kernel packages have i2c kernel support by default?
[12:40] <floating> bimberi: so nautilus is a whole new file manager... hmm maybe I have to skip
[12:40] <bimberi> floating: yes, hang on a sec...
[12:40] <Luke> do the deb-src lines give you all the "-src" packages?
[12:40] <vldmr> soundray I have the root password but it dont work. why ?
[12:41] <gnomefreak> Luke: yes
[12:41] <Luke> gnomefreak: thanks

[12:41] <Luke> gnomefreak: ok thanks. i need that for development
[12:41] <BlueEagle> vldmr: gksudo asks for the current users password.
[12:42] <pradeep> willvdl you could ask at #ubuntu-kernel if you don't find your answer here
[12:42] <BlueEagle> vldmr: The current user needs to be in either adm or admin group (don't remember which)

[12:42] <bimberi> floating: you could try mounting the share (as shown) and it should be visible in Thunar
[12:43] <vldmr> BlueEagle: and the root ?
[12:43] <bimberi> !winkey | [Gino] 
[12:43] <ubotu> [Gino] : To use the windows key in keyboard shortcuts as a modifier (like ALT): Run 'xmodmap' and see what Super_L corresponds to.  Then follow method B at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79560 and use <mod4> (or whatever Super_L corresponded to with 'xmodmap') as the modifier. For example, a shortcut to use windows key + d would look like '<mod4>d'

[12:57] <poolkey172> whats the best kernel for dual core ?
[12:57] <natrix> the problem is on exe apps not on usb stick actually

[12:58] <Vig> How do I restore those Multiple Desktop switchers on the little taskbar on the bottom?
[12:59] <minimec> natrix: So the problem is not the stick, but the software for fingerprint recognition. Is that true?
[12:59] <gurkZor> ubs: are you a bot or a real person?
[12:59] <natrix> yes minimec that's correct
[12:59] <bimberi> floating: ewww, not sure sorry.  To google (unless someone else knows)

[01:02] <jonkopa> :-( mounted media doesn't appear to be DVDRW or DVD-RAM
[01:02] <MiniJames> poolkey172, synce and multisync is what i was reffering to
[01:03] <gurkZor> bimberi: Same error, and Ive installed generic
[01:03] <poolkey172> minijames oic : Well they didnt work too well for me
[01:03] <Vollstrecker> Anyone here that can help me with this: http://forum.amule.org/thread.php?threadid=11561&sid= ?
[01:03] <bimberi> gurkZor: did you reboot?
[01:03] <MiniJames> oh, poolkey172, system > preferences > removable drives and media
[01:03] <poolkey172> minijames I can connect the ppc and browse it but not sync PIM items
[01:03] <MiniJames> poolkey172, thats more than I managed ;)
[01:03] <gurkZor> bimberi: haha, nope.. guess that's important xD
[01:03] <poolkey172> minijames hmmmmm
[01:04] <tore> Does anyone know how to install Dapper on SunFire X4100-es?  According to www.ubuntu.com these should be supported, but the mptsas driver shipped doesn't appear to recognise the RAID controller that these boxes use.
[01:04] <minimec> natrix: Do you speak german?
[01:04] <bimberi> Morrissey: should work out of the box. what does 'glxinfo | grep direct' say (for direct rendering)?
[01:04] <bimberi> gurkZor: :)
[01:04] <tore> Is there some custom install image somewhere, mayhap?
[01:04] <natrix> minimec: No
[01:04] <poolkey172> lots of questions :rollseyes:
[01:04] <gurkZor> tore:  You mean alternative?
[01:05] <tore> gurkZor: Not really.  What do you mean by that?
[01:05] <CrIcK> Guys does XGL work on Intel 845Gl chipset with onboard graphics?
[01:05] <minimec> natrix: Well I found something on that stick and the software... but in german
[01:05] <poolkey172> crick yes
[01:06] <CrIcK> could u point me to some guides poolkey172
[01:06] <poolkey172> crick download a decent distro first
[01:06] <natrix> minimec: can you tell me the basics or give me the address in net if I can find any info?
[01:06] <CrIcK> i'm on Dapper Drake
[01:06] <minimec> natrix: What about french?
[01:06] <poolkey172> like say koraa livecd : download it and it'll run XGL outa the box
[01:07] <gurkZor> tore: Thought you meant alternative when you said custom.
[01:07] <poolkey172> :)
[01:07] <natrix> minimec: No I am afraid only english and greek !!
[01:07] <CrIcK> Yeah i have it
[01:07] <CrIcK> but the livecd is way 2 slow
[01:07] <incorrect> does anyone here run the amd64 ubuntu distro?
[01:07] <poolkey172> crick : sweet
[01:07] <natrix> minimec: Can qemu do something ?
[01:07] <minimec> natrix: Well I give you the two links ... http://skreo.murties.com/index.php/2006/08/22/17-securite-pgp-biometrie
[01:08] <poolkey172> crick : try g00gling "ubuntu xgl howto" :)
[01:08] <minimec> natrix: http://www.heise.de/mobil/artikel/79122
[01:08] <CrIcK> whats the diff. between Aiglx and xgl?
[01:08] <tore> gurkZor: Well, I'm just looking for an installer that'll be able to find the RAID controller in these boxes.  I've earlier been hacking my way around it, but now I see that Sun servers are officially supported, so I would think there is an alternative/custom/whatever installer available somewhere that actually work with them.
[01:09] <sparr> im looking for an animated gif of a linux/foss (kde, tux, ubuntu, kubuntu, etc) logo pissing on a windows (xp, vista, whatever) logo.  anyone got one handy?
[01:09] <minimec> natrix: Well it seems, that you can run them with linux and mac, but you need a windows computer for the configuration.
[01:09] <natrix> minimec: thanks a lot
[01:09] <poolkey172> crick : I'm a newbie also : but from what I see aiglx / glx (ati vs nvidia) compiz / beryl (windows managers)
[01:10] <poolkey172> crick : appears that ati drivers suck
[01:10] <natrix> minimec: I have access to windows PC
[01:10] <minimec> natrix: So there is hope ;)
[01:10] <CrIcK> K thanjs poolkey172
[01:10] <CrIcK> will do some reseacrh & come back
[01:10] <gurkZor> tore: Ok, I'm sorry but then I think I can't help you out
[01:10] <CrIcK> *research
[01:10] <poolkey172> tore : ubuntu is rubbish cant install on RAID I have been doing it manually
[01:10] <CrIcK> thanks a ton :)
[01:11] <jonkopa> poolkey172, and?
[01:11] <natrix> minimec: Did you understand how from your quick search in these links?
[01:11] <cuteAndFluffy> Good day! A quick question, do ubuntu have support for PPC? (ie, Mac)
[01:11] <gurkZor> Yes cuteAndFluffy
[01:11] <natrix> minimec: there is always hope :)
[01:11] <sparr> yes
[01:12] <sparr> cuteAndFluffy: not just support, whole native install discs
[01:12] <MikeyMike> is there an 'empty trash'
[01:12] <cuteAndFluffy> Oh how nice :) I can't seem to find any info on that on the webpage though..
[01:12] <chaelot|work> Hello, i am rather new to Linux and Ubuntu in general. I just switched from Windows and got my Ubuntu installation to run almost as i want it to. The only question i have at this point is: how come it sounds like any mp3/sound playback comes out of a tin can, whereas i have good quality sound playback in Windows ?
[01:12] <poolkey172> jonkopa : and what ?
[01:12] <chaelot|work> i guess it's some setting somewhere i need to tweak, but as i said, i'm a newbie and dont know where :)
[01:12] <MikeyMike> where's the trash emptier!
[01:12] <MikeyMike> :D
[01:13] <tore> poolkey172: So what I'm reading about "certified to run" and so on at <http://www.ubuntu.com/sun> is basically hyperbole?
[01:13] <gurkZor> MikeyMike: in the right corner?
[01:13] <MikeyMike> i guess im going to have to add the stupid little trash can back to my gnome panel
[01:13] <MikeyMike> gurkZor, i got rid of that
[01:13] <poolkey172> chaelot|work : lol thats cos windows is the better operating system :)
[01:13] <gurkZor> hehe
[01:13] <gurkZor> oke
[01:13] <tore> gurkZor: No problem, thanks anyway.
[01:13] <gurkZor> MikeyMike: try ALT + F2 nautilus
[01:13] <reus>    Starting httpd.vmware:-ne                                          failed
[01:13] <poolkey172> tore : give me the linky : let me see
[01:13] <MikeyMike> erm
[01:13] <MikeyMike> okay?
[01:13] <sparr> cuteAndFluffy: on the download page, pick a location, then "CD Image for Apple Macintosh PowerPC based desktop and laptop computers"
[01:13] <reus> whats the apache line apt-get needs ?
[01:13] <gurkZor> MikeyMike:  and goto trash:
[01:13] <chaelot|work> poolkey172: :(
[01:13] <gurkZor> MikeyMike:  How did you do?
[01:14] <MikeyMike> it works
[01:14] <minimec> natrix: You have to run that thing on windows first to the definition of the fingerprint. Afterwards, the fingerprint recognition works.
[01:14] <MikeyMike> gurkZor, that brings me to .Trash
[01:14] <MikeyMike> ok well
[01:14] <reus> apt-get install apache ?
[01:14] <MikeyMike> its empty now
[01:14] <MikeyMike> :)
[01:14] <poolkey172> chaelot|work : try installing xmms its what I use and it sounds great
[01:14] <cuteAndFluffy> sparr: Just found it :) I must be tired to have missed that :P
[01:14] <gurkZor> reus:  apache2
[01:14] <sparr> cuteAndFluffy: consider kubuntu instead of ubuntu  :)
[01:14] <tore> poolkey172: I already did?
[01:14] <reus> xD thkx
[01:14] <bimberi> reus: sudo apt-get ...
[01:14] <dawkirst> chaelot|work: I can remember something like that happened to me as well...did you try another application yet?
[01:14] <cuteAndFluffy> sparr: what's the difference?
[01:14] <Whitman> Hi, is there a repo anywhere with php 5.2 for edgy?
[01:14] <chaelot|work> poolkey172, i did, and i use the ALSA drivers etc. i also tried AMAROK
[01:14] <alexis> hello
[01:14] <minimec> natrix: http://skreo.murties.com/
[01:15] <sparr> cuteAndFluffy: default GUI
[01:15] <poolkey172> tore : what are u trying to install on ?
[01:15] <cuteAndFluffy> ohh.. thanks! :)
[01:15] <chaelot|work> dawkirst, yes, i've tried a few, the problems seems to be a bit of Gain on the output signal and no bottom (base)
[01:15] <alexis> hello
[01:15] <sparr> cuteAndFluffy: you can change from one to the other post-install by installing a meta package, so its not a big decision
[01:15] <tore> poolkey172: A SunFire X4100.
[01:15] <poolkey172> tore : rofl
[01:16] <poolkey172> tore : why r u wasting your hardware ?
[01:16] <tore> poolkey172: What do you mean?
[01:16] <reus> Generating SSL Server Certificate
[01:16] <reus>    Starting httpd.vmware:-ne                                          failed
[01:16] <reus> still fails :$
[01:16] <dawkirst> chaelot|work: weird...have you tried googling for similar problems? Maybe Ubuntu doesn't like your sound device?
[01:16] <reus> even with apache installed
[01:16] <Morrissey> bimberi, direct rendering: no
[01:19] (ubs/#ubuntu) how to change the permission on a mounted filesystem
[01:19] (tore/#ubuntu) poolkey172: The installer doesn't recognise the RAID controller.  I was assuming that it would, given the fact that Ubuntu's web pages explicitly mentions that this particular server is supported.
[01:19] (Morrissey/#ubuntu) bimberi, cat /var/log/Xorg.0.conf says: Direct rendering: Enabled
[01:20] (poolkey172/#ubuntu) tore : ROFL : this ubiquity thing is a kiddies installer
[01:20] (poolkey172/#ubuntu) tore : what do u expect ?
[01:20] (bimberi/#ubuntu) Morrissey: riight.  well that's ... interesting :|
[01:20] (Morrissey/#ubuntu) bimberi, loaded and initiziales /usr/lib/dri/i915_dri.so ... this is maybe wrong?
[01:20] (tore/#ubuntu) poolkey172: I'll always be able to hack around it by suppying it custom modules from a USB drive, but it's a pain in the arse.
[01:20] (natrix/#ubuntu) minimec: Still here?
[01:21] (poolkey172/#ubuntu) tore : try this
[01:21] (bimberi/#ubuntu) Morrissey: It 'just works(tm)' here.  I'll pastebin my xorg.conf for comparison purposes if you like
[01:21] <felixfoertsch_> Hi there!
[01:21] (minimec/#ubuntu) natrix: I think, you can use pgp for encryption.
[01:21] (Morrissey/#ubuntu) thanks bimberi
[01:21] <geokok> Hi. I specify a port to be opened in firestarter but it keeps blocking ip's connecting through that port. What can I do?
[01:21] <felixfoertsch_> Could anyone tell me how to teach Ubuntu to shutdown completely?
[01:21] <natrix> minimec: Did you understand how?
[01:21] <reus>    Starting httpd.vmware:-ne                                          failed
[01:22] <reus> im trying virtuals server vmware
[01:22] <poolkey172> tore : try this : Install the OS on a seperate drive : create the RAID then copy the OS to the RAID its what I am having to do
[01:22] <[GuS] > Bonjour...
[01:23] <MiniJames> reus, what are you trying to achieve
[01:23] <felixfoertsch_> My Ubuntu does no complete shutdown after I told it to shutdown. I have to press the power button all the time.
[01:23] <LadyNikon> felixfoertsch_: click on the red button in the upper right corner
[01:23] <bimberi> Morrissey: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34341/  (I'm running Edgy i386 by the way)
[01:23] <minimec> natrix: That french guy has a pgp encrypted patition and only does synchronisation stick <-> pgp-partition.
[01:23] <Morrissey> thanks bimberi
[01:23] <felixfoertsch_> LadyNikon: ... how funny is that?
[01:24] <LadyNikon> felixfoertsch_: heh.
[01:24] <tore> poolkey172: Yes, I will be able to hack around it.  I was just hoping to not have to do it since it's a pain in the arse.  But I guess Ubuntu's support for these devices isn't really what I thought.
[01:24] <highneko> Can someone help me with a vnc problem? On my pc I get "VNC authentication failed". I just setup vncpasswd on my remote machine, then edited the xorg with this tutorial http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279069&highlight=vncviewer and it says wrong password. I'll try using vncpasswd again, maybe I did it wrong.
[01:24] <poolkey172> tore : As i said this ubuntu is a kiddies system
[01:25] <natrix> minimec: the encryped partition is where? inside the stick?
[01:25] <LadyNikon> felixfoertsch_: i just learned the other day ( sadly to say) that all you have to do is press enter to change a file or folder name on my mac.
[01:25] <minimec> natrix: I'm pretty sure, that you can find some english howto's on the net about your stick and Linux.
[01:25] <LadyNikon> had the bloody thing a year..
[01:25] <poolkey172> tore : why didnt u install something more enterprisish like redhat/fedora/suse
[01:25] <LadyNikon> right click didnt work heh
=== felixfoertsch_ is now known as felixfoertsch
[01:25] <rdz> hi all. how can i find out from which package a certain file is part of?
[01:26] <minimec> natrix: On the Desktop. And then he does the synchronisation with the stick.
[01:26] <bimberi> Morrissey: yw :)
[01:26] <LadyNikon> btw morning all
[01:26] <Kenas> hi is it possible to open with wine a document in samba ???
[01:26] <gurkZor> bimberi: I did the "sudo modprobe pwc" command, but it didn't do the trick
[01:26] <tore> poolkey172: Because I want Ubuntu, obviously.
[01:26] <gurkZor> got any other idea?
[01:26] <natrix> minimec: I am trying to find now something to that but it gives me as first options the links that you send me (french...)!
[01:27] <tore> poolkey172: Just found https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/37452, by the way.
[01:27] <felixfoertsch> Could anyone tell me how to shutdown Ubuntu completely - without pressing the power-button?
[01:27] <bimberi> gurkZor: sorry, no :|
[01:27] <Kenas> is it possible to open in wine a document in samba ?
[01:27] <poolkey172> lol @ tore : Cos its easy peasy with apt loads of repositiries too
[01:27] <LadyNikon> felixfoertsch: that option i gave you didnt work?
[01:27] <rdz> /usr/local/include/GL/glext.h tells me somehting about nvidia, though i have fglrx installed
[01:27] <natrix> minimec: do you know if pgp works with ubuntu?
[01:27] <gurkZor> ok, thanks anyway bimberi. And btw do I have to choose -generic every boot from now on?
[01:27] <poolkey172> lol @ tore : Thats why poolkey too is using this kiddies system (its just too easy with ubuntu)
[01:28] <rdz> felixfoertsch, you could also use commandline: sudo halt
[01:28] <felixfoertsch> LadyNikon: ... I know the red button - but thats not the problem. The problem is not the shutdown itself, but the need of pressing the power-button after shutting down.
[01:28] <minimec> natrix: Why shouldn't it? I never tried it, but I guess there is no problem.
[01:28] <felixfoertsch> My PC does not POWER OFF after shutdown.
[01:28] <LadyNikon> felixfoertsch: well you didnt say you tried that :P
[01:28] <poolkey172> tore : that refers to the 2.6.15 kernel
[01:29] <rdz> felixfoertsch, this might bot be a software issue, but an issue of your mainboard
[01:29] <LadyNikon> hmm rdz will halt even power it off.
[01:29] <felixfoertsch> My monitor shows a black screen with a blinking white cursor. That's it. No poweroff.
[01:29] <mdasilva> Hi
[01:29] <bimberi> gurkZor: up to you, choose the one you feel is performing the best :).  by the way you can change the default by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst (line beginning with 'default')
[01:29] <tore> poolkey172: Which is what Dapper is shipping.
[01:29] <felixfoertsch> rdz: But it worked well yesterday on the old Ubuntu installation.
[01:29] <phpnuborn> ok.. i just tried     apt-get install bum  > errmsg.txt      but the error messages are going to  stderr i think.. so how would i redirect stderr to a file?
[01:29] <geokok> Any help with firestarter?A port although opened remains blocked
[01:29] <natrix> minimec: Ok then, I'll try it! thank you very much for the help !!!!
[01:29] <poolkey172> tore : why dont u want to use edgy ?
[01:29] <gurkZor> bimberi: I'm aware of that, but I can't tell the difference between -generic an "normal"
[01:30] <felixfoertsch> rdz: Had to reinstall Ubuntu yesterday because of an odd gnome-panel error.
[01:30] <rdz> felixfoertsch, ah in that case it seems to be a software issue....
[01:30] <bimberi> gurkZor: uname -r
[01:30] <minimec> natrix: np
[01:30] <rdz> felixfoertsch, but i don't have a clue right now
[01:30] <felixfoertsch> rdz: Me neither :(
[01:30] <tore> poolkey172: Because I want LTS.
[01:30] <gurkZor> bimberi: I'm running -generic but I don't "feel" the difference
[01:30] <felixfoertsch> rdz: Maybe it has something to do with ACPI.
[01:31] <poolkey172> tore : whats LTS : I'm a newbie to ubuntu
[01:31] <felixfoertsch> rdz: I had to extend the install options by "acpi=off" to install Ubuntu. Maybe I have to remove this now?
[01:31] <bimberi> gurkZor: there probably isn't much between it and -386
[01:31] <tore> poolkey172: Long Time Support.  Five years, that is.
[01:31] <Vi1> What is LTS on a PC? that one still has me giggling:)
[01:31] <natrix> minimec: I let you know if this can work!
[01:31] <mdasilva> no
[01:31] <rdz> felixfoertsch, i would try that, but i don't really know. but it sounds 'nachvollzehbar'
[01:31] <poolkey172> tore : ic
[01:31] <minimec> natrix: ok.
[01:32] <poolkey172> tore : dont we get that with edgy ?
[01:32] <phpnuborn> can strerr be redirected ti a file?
[01:32] <felixfoertsch> rdz: "nachvollziehbar" you mean ;) - where are those ACPI settings saved?
[01:32] <natrix> minimec: see you later.
[01:32] <phpnuborn> *to
[01:32] <rdz> felixfoertsch, no clue, sorry
[01:32] <felixfoertsch> rdz: Well I'll find it some day. Thanks.
[01:33] <rdz> felixfoertsch, hope so, sorry that i couldn't help
[01:33] <gurkZor> ok, Thanks bimberi
[01:33] <Celldweller> how do I delete the trash can from bash
[01:33] <poolkey172> tore : looks like that link u found (http://jesusch.de/?page=ubuntu) is the way to go
[01:33] <Celldweller> evnen though it says i have permissions it wont let me lol
[01:33] <rdz> how can i find out, from which package a certain file is part of?
[01:34] <rdz> /usr/local/include/GL/glext.h: where is that from?
[01:34] <bimberi> felixfoertsch: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290713
[01:34] <Vi1> Wait, I did not download the LTS version, or I don't know if I did, How do I know?
[01:35] <felixfoertsch> bimberi: Big THX!
[01:35] <bimberi> Celldweller: sudo rm ~/.Trash/*
[01:35] <Celldweller> thnkx
[01:35] <tore> poolkey172: Yes.  But it still makes me wonder if there's any QA done at all before proudly declaring that Ubuntu is "certified to run" on these servers.  I'll still need a custom kernel, it seems.  Very disappointing.
[01:35] <bimberi> felixfoertsch: np, hopefully something there works for you :)
[01:35] <poolkey172> lol @ tore
[01:36] <felixfoertsch> bimberi: I remember this thread - that was the little thing I needed :D
[01:36] <SWAT_laptop> urgent help needed: how do I get a matrox millennium g550 working with 3D? In about 30 minutes I'll have a lot of people asking me for an answer :-/

[01:36] <reus>  im trying virtuals server vmware
[01:36] <poolkey172> it even converted me
[01:37] <Celldweller> ok i found out why
[01:37] <Celldweller> the idiot room mate made some directories
[01:37] <reus> anybody know howto vmware virtual server ?
[01:37] <Celldweller> grrrrrr
[01:37] <felixfoertsch> Thanks all!
[01:37] <tore> poolkey172: I disagree, but I'm not really interested in having that discussion right now.
[01:37] <poolkey172> tore : no worries
[01:38] <reus> :$
[01:38] <[GuS] > reus, theres a lot of info in the net about that
[01:38] <[GuS] > search in google :P
[01:38] <poolkey172> tore : good luck with the install
[01:38] <reus> tried a howto it fails at startin the mui
[01:38] <reus> :$
[01:38] <tore> poolkey172: Thanks.
[01:38] <phpnuborn> i have just 2  lines to paste.. i promise..    that ok?
[01:38] <[GuS] > poolkey172, sometimes i think that too...
[01:39] <[GuS] > and more with the decission to integrate closed source drivers...
[01:39] <poolkey172> [GuS]  dont get me wrong I do like ubuntu
[01:39] <phpnuborn> E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
[01:39] <phpnuborn> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
[01:39] <[GuS] > hey me too
[01:39] <phpnuborn> i am root
[01:39] <[GuS] > (i use Kubuntu since it beginning)
[01:40] <poolkey172> [GuS]  I have been a windows user for 15 years : got fed up that things slow down after time
[01:40] <[GuS] > but use by default those drivers? is a not good idea... users have the right to choose
[01:40] <[GuS] > so must be optional
[01:40] <phpnuborn> so why might i be getting those with..    apt-get install bum   ?
[01:40] <Daylighter> phpnuborn, sudo apt-get install bum
[01:41] <phpnuborn> i'm root user..  already
[01:41] <Daylighter> according to that error you arent
[01:41] <phpnuborn> or superuser.. no need to sudo
[01:41] <roh> phpnuborn, the administration area may be locked by another apt process
[01:41] <[GuS] > phpnuborn,
[01:41] <Daylighter> oh yes
[01:41] <[GuS] > look into ps aux
[01:41] <Daylighter> I forgot about hatt
[01:41] <[GuS] > maybe the app is lock...
[01:41] <[GuS] > killl it

[01:42] <poolkey172> thanks bimeri
[01:42] <poolkey172> lol no response he's doing a sudo -s
[01:43] <RobNyc[] > i wonder if the guides for ubuntu work for debian ?
[01:44] <minimec> RobNyc[] : It depends on what you're working on...
[01:44] <poolkey172> RobNyc[]  depends its software related or OS related.... I have used guides for gentoo to help ubuntu issue : u just tweak along the way if you understand the structure of your distro
[01:45] <rasputnik> anyone know how to boot proper single user? 'emergency' mode won't let me umount /var
[01:45] <RobNyc[] > minimec, for example ati-drivers later xgl , beryl,
[01:45] <poolkey172> like how INIT works vs 2.4x to 2.6x and /etc/init.d /etc etc
[01:46] <poolkey172> rasputnik : rescue mode not good enough ?
[01:46] <Vig> This is a fun OS!
[01:46] <rasputnik> poolkey172: is that different to the grub menu entry?
[01:47] <poolkey172> rasputnik : should be the same it should dump u into a shell at run level 0
[01:47] <minimec> RobNyc[] : hmm... xorg configuration should be the same. The repo for debian testing (etch) is surely different. The ati drivers do not exist in a simple deb package, I think. I don't remember anymore.
[01:47] <rasputnik> didn't seem to, but I'll try again
[01:47] <bimberi> rasputnik: otherwise, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword (Last Resort bit)
[01:47] <bimberi> ooh, missed 'im
[01:47] <Luke> is anyone else having problems with avahi not starting?
[01:48] <mawx> Luke, maybe... what do you mean by avahi not starting?
[01:48] <minimec> RobNyc[] : So I guess. You will have some 'manual' work to install the ati-drivers, but there should be a repository for xgl and beryl and compiz ...

[01:49] <mawx> Luke, I do have trouble connecting to other computers on the local net running itunes using both rythmbox and banshee.
[01:50] <phpnuborn> oh i give up on linux..
[01:50] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : u give up 2 easily
[01:50] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : type 'sudo -s'
[01:50] <phpnuborn> too complex.. just to do the simplest crap..
[01:51] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : depends if you're willing to learn : learn and u'll reap the rewards
[01:51] <phpnuborn> everytime i try the smallest task.. it turns into a half a day chore
[01:51] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : no pain no gain
[01:51] <Luke> mawx: my avahi is not running... check in banshee and see if the plugin was loaded for itunes sharing
[01:52] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : having used linux for over 10 years I still have problems
[01:52] <Luke> mawx: also try sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart .... it doesnt do anything
[01:52] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : learn all the time
[01:53] <mawx> Luke, Music sharing plugin in banshee says it could not be installed
[01:53] <mawx> Luke, rhythmbox won't share either.
[01:53] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : last night I spend 6 BLOODY hours trying to get the piece of junk(ubuntu) onto a RAID array Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:54] <mawx> Luke, sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart doesn't seem to do anything either.
[01:54] <minimec> RobNyc[] : Got something for you ;) http://michael.susens-schurter.com/blog/2006/11/20/installing-fglrx-ati-drivers-in-debian-etch/
[01:54] <Luke> mawx: there seems to be an error with the init script... i dont know why no one else is complaining
[01:54] <Luke> mawx: i just wanted to confirm
[01:54] <phpnuborn> well  sudo -s   worked.. id show me as uid=0(root)
[01:55] <bimberi> \o/
[01:55] <phpnuborn> now thats a useful command
[01:55] <RobNyc[] > minimec, thanks a bunch =)
[01:55] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : now you're the root user : or stupid user as I call him
[01:55] <minimec> RobNyc[] : np
[01:55] <phpnuborn> one of the few in *nix
[01:55] <silver> salut
[01:55] <mawx> Luke, Can confirm the problem - might not be caused by config file but by missing packages etc, though.
[01:55] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : now u can install remove packages with apt etc
[01:56] <Luke> mawx: should be fixied by reinstalling then?
[01:56] <Luke> mawx: either way - its a problem with the edgy update
[01:56] <phpnuborn> i started just trying to get xfce gui in xubuntu to not auto-load at boot up...
[01:57] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : why dont you do all this via synaptic or adept manager ?
[01:57] <phpnuborn> not just the   ctrl-alt-f1  thingy either
[01:58] <phpnuborn> huh?   synaptic?  adept manager?
[01:58] <Impetus|Fatkid> hey anyone around
[01:58] <Luke> mawx: after I make a bug report, care to confirm it for me?
[01:58] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : refresh me : when u boot ure machine u do get a gui asking u log in right ?
[01:58] <roh> phpnuborn: graphical package management interfaces
[01:58] <mawx> Luke, send me the url, i'll confirm.
[01:59] <phpnuborn> how would i find out if they are in my installed VM xubuntu distro?
[01:59] <phpnuborn> goes right into a gui called  xfce
[01:59] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : good question : I'd like the answer for this too
[01:59] <Impetus|Fatkid> i just download 6.10 burned it and everything restarted but it seems to start of the cd
[01:59] <Impetus|Fatkid> and not install
[01:59] <Impetus|Fatkid> altho i pressed start..install tab
[02:00] <poolkey172> anyone know ? I'm an old time rpm man : rpm -qa | grep etc
[02:00] <highneko> Can someone help me with a vnc problem? On my pc I get "VNC authentication failed". I just setup vncpasswd on my remote machine, then edited the xorg with this tutorial http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279069&highlight=vncviewer and it says wrong password.
[02:00] <bluesign> how can I restart iptables on ubuntu ?
[02:00] <poolkey172> Anyone ? How can I list the packages that I have installed currently ?
[02:01] <bimberi> phpnuborn, poolkey172: dpkg -l synaptic   (or adept)
[02:01] <roh> poolkey172, dpkg -l bash
[02:01] <chrish> /etc/init.d/iptables restart
[02:01] <highneko> poolkey172: Adept filter for installed programs.
[02:01] <Luke> mawx: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/avahi/+bug/73461
[02:01] <bimberi> poolkey172: dpkg -l   will list them all
[02:01] <poolkey172> Thanks guys
[02:01] <mawx> Luke,  /usr/sbin/avahi-daemon -c seems to be the programm called from the init script.
[02:01] <bluesign> chrish: there is no iptables there

[02:02] <mawx> Luke, it returns an error for me
[02:02] <Luke> mawx: same but running it normally I can start it
[02:02] <mawx> Luke, well it does not return 0 at least.
[02:02] <Impetus|Fatkid> how do i install 6.10 please help
[02:02] <Impetus|Fatkid> i just get the option for booting from cd only
[02:02] <chrish> it it running bluesign what does iptables -L give you?
[02:02] <Luke> mawx: just try running "avahi-daemon"
[02:02] <mawx> Luke, ahh, sorry. guess -c just checks if avahi is up already.
[02:03] <highneko> Impetus|Fatkid: Do that then execute the livecd installer.
[02:03] <imperfect-> Is there an easy way to convert kbuntu to regular ubuntu without reinstalling?
[02:03] <Impetus|Fatkid> is that in startup from reboot or from windows now
[02:03] <bluesign> chrish: yep it is listing my fw rules
[02:03] <ndlovu> I need to get a new laptop, so I'm comparing specs - does Ubuntu support Intel centrino core duo processors?
[02:03] <mawx> Luke, right running avahi-daemon by hand works for me.
[02:03] <RobNyc[] > minimec, so you think those isntructions are what i gotta do?
[02:03] <poolkey172> imperfect : I would think apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[02:03] <bimberi> poolkey172: that's the way, unlearn that rpm stuff :)
[02:04] <poolkey172> lol@bimberi
[02:04] <Luke> mawx: cool. you have the same results as me
[02:04] <vivid> im trying to run firestarter in edgy with sudo NOPASSWD, but the nopasswd entry isnt working...has the sudo syntax changed or something?
[02:04] <poolkey172> bimberi : I have an old machine in a datacentre running redhat 5 or something
[02:05] <Impetus|Fatkid> it seems my cd i have is a live cd
[02:05] <bimberi> poolkey172: ha, beats me, my oldest is RH 7.2
[02:05] <mawx> Luke, Banshee still won't list the plugin though.
[02:05] <Impetus|Fatkid> to just show u a trial
[02:05] <poolkey172> vivid: check visudo
[02:05] <minimec> RobNyc[] : this is the first step. After that howto you will have a running fglrx driver on your system. As a 2nd step you will need to install the xgl and beryl binaries. I am pretty sure that you will find a inofficial etch repository containing the software you need.
[02:05] <phpnuborn> [07:56]  <poolkey172> phpnuborn : why dont you do all this via synaptic or adept manager ?  <<--   how do i find out if these are already installed?
[02:05] <bimberi> Impetus|Fatkid: there is an Install icon on the Desktop once it boots
[02:05] <Luke> mawx: if you restart banshee it does
[02:05] <rag> hi *
[02:06] <RobNyc[] > minimec, yea i'll look in the beryl site wiki they have a couple of instructions :)
[02:06] <Impetus|Fatkid> whats the user name n pass tho
[02:06] <vivid> poolkey172: i have entered 'username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/firestarter' with visudo, yet im getting no response when running sudo firestarter
[02:06] <minimec> RobNyc[] : Good idea.
[02:06] <Impetus|Fatkid> coz when it startd it said it couldnt load the starting program trying another
[02:06] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : I just learnt this right now myself : dpkg -l adept
[02:06] <Impetus|Fatkid> then it just went to a login screen
[02:06] <poolkey172> dpkg -l synaptic
[02:06] <bimberi> phpnuborn: [00:01] <bimberi> phpnuborn, poolkey172: dpkg -l synaptic   (or adept)
[02:06] <RobNyc[] > hehe thanks for the support.. i have ubuntu edgy here on my celeron and debian 4.0 aka etch on my prescott
[02:06] <chrish> #ubuntu-freshers
[02:07] <chrish> doh
[02:07] <mawx> Luke, right.
[02:07] <chrish> no idea about the iptables thats odd
[02:07] <mawx> Luke, Ahh, this might be due to the "no ports open policy" in ubuntu.
[02:07] <poolkey172> # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
[02:07] <poolkey172> %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
[02:07] <rag> hi * anyone know how to pass parameter
[02:07] <mawx> Luke, They ship it without any ports open - so avahi should not open ports by default.
[02:08] <mawx> Luke, Maybe there is some switch to turn it on.
[02:08] <Luke> mawx: i'm not sure how to fix that... but it should work by default
[02:08] <mawx> Luke, will still confirm your bugreport.
[02:08] <rag> on alternate cd, but no one time but all times i insert a cd alternate for install, it put parameters automatic
[02:08] <Luke> mawx: thanks
[02:08] <Luke> mawx: if you can find more info as well... that'd be great
[02:09] <RobNyc[] > beryl site down so ill just follow those directions ty again
[02:09] <rag> is there any file for put this parameters on alternate cd install?
=== minimec is now known as minimec|afk
[02:09] <poolkey172> sweet just learnt up on dpkg-*
[02:09] <vivid> poolkey172: if i add NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/firestarter to the %admin entry, i get Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
[02:10] <vivid> but at least it doesnt ask for a password
[02:10] <rainyrhythm> i think it's the xauth problem vivid
[02:10] <poolkey172> vivid : are u running it as kedsu ?
[02:10] <vivid> no
[02:11] <vivid> using edgy/gnome/sudo
[02:11] <poolkey172> ok well it should work then
[02:11] <poolkey172> try it from the command line
[02:11] <vivid> well, tell that to visudo
[02:11] <vivid> thats what ive been using
[02:11] <poolkey172> use your default user id
[02:11] <rainyrhythm> vivid you know xauth ?
[02:12] <poolkey172> open a shell
[02:12] <vivid> rainyrhythm: yea, if i can use xhost + to remove the access, but it has to be done everytime i log on
[02:12] <rainyrhythm> oh..
[02:13] <tripppy> how do i make a script to run a bunch of terminal commands?
[02:13] <Vig> Somethin is messed up,,well better said, I messed something up, my apps that are running,Firfox,This GAIM, TBird, whatever is dissapearing somewhere and not going to bottom taskbar...ideas?

[02:14] <rag> i want safe me i put noapic, nolapic on installation each
[02:15] <soundray> Kim^J: where you entered 'IP' you were supposed to put the actual IP address of the server.
[02:15] <rag> is possible?
[02:15] <highneko> I installed a normal vncserver. When I use vncviewer I can see my remote desktop but the panels load for a second then keep dissapearing. I's unusable Here's a screenshot http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f295/numbers6554/Screenshot2.png any ideas?
[02:15] <vivid> so anyone else with edgy having troubles with sudo nopasswd?
[02:15] <poolkey172> Kim^J : what does showmount -e ipaddressofyourNFSserversay ?
[02:15] <Kim^J> soundray: I know. Just didn't wan't to write the IP out on this channel.
[02:15] <rag> highneko: try freenx, is better
[02:16] <adi> hi
[02:16] <soundray> !nfs | Kim^J
[02:16] <ubotu> Kim^J: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[02:16] <rag> highneko: than vnc
[02:16] <tripppy> vivid: i put my commands in the txt file and run the file as root, /bin/sh text.txt

[02:16] <roh> tripppy, you probably don't need to be root but that should work
[02:16] <mawx> e319, i don't know if there is an iso yet. I'd install edgy and then run...

[02:16] <highneko> rag: Different packages of things.
[02:17] <phpnuborn> whats the pastebin  this channel prefers?
[02:17] <soundray> !pastebin | phpnuborn
[02:17] <ubotu> phpnuborn: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (be sure to give the URL of your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:17] <mawx> e319, sudo aptitude update && sudo dist-upgrade
[02:17] <tripppy> woot thnx
[02:17] <poolkey172> Kim^J Read the NFS howto as recommended and also ensure portmap/nfs/ /etc/exports are correctly  running on the NFS server
[02:17] <adi> hi
[02:17] <rag> highneko: then you have other problems, security or firewalls for example, it block you
[02:17] <roh> tripppy, you can make the file executable (and run it) from the gui too
[02:17] <mawx> e319, You'd have to change /etc/apt/sources.list before that though.
[02:17] <adi> hi
[02:17] <e319> hmm ok
[02:17] <Kim^J> poolkey172: Ok.
[02:18] <rag> hi * any way for pass parameters to alternate cd install
[02:18] <rag> ?
[02:18] <highneko> rag: Why would you think that? It displays the background and stuff.
[02:18] <soundray> e319: why do you want feisty rather than edgy?
[02:18] <mawx> e319, but maybe check the ubuntu page if there is a knot / flight out yet.
[02:18] <adi> hi sugar
[02:18] <rag> always same parameters, and then i safe than i put noapic, nolapic always :)
[02:18] <rag> and press F6 to pass parameters...
[02:18] <rag> :)
[02:19] <phpnuborn> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34346/  <<--  so is synaptic   fully loaded or what??
[02:19] <mawx> e319, but it's still really early for feisty - you'll definitly run into some interesting trouble ;)
[02:19] <roh> rag, I imagine you can type "c" from the GRUB bootloader on the CD...
[02:19] <rag> highneko: ah ok then i dont know
[02:19] <vivid> feisty is probably really close to the same as edgy at this point..
[02:19] <soundray> phpnuborn: no. Run 'sudo apt-get install synaptic'
[02:19] <rag> highneko: are you tried with other softwares?
[02:20] <roh> phpnuborn, It looks like synaptic *was* installed, but removed
[02:20] <rag> roh: no, i want not only for 1 time but automatic process
[02:20] <poolkey172> phpnuborn yes it is
[02:20] <rag> auto process for always , pass same parameters
[02:20] <soundray> poolkey172: no it isn't (phpnuborn)
[02:20] <roh> rag, so you want to edit your grub.conf and add the parameters there?
[02:20] <rag> roh: auto process for always , pass same parameters
[02:20] <highneko> ragTired? I'm tired of trying other things kinda. I would like something to work well, and I have seen a screenshot of vnc working really nice.
[02:20] <rag> roh: you know?
[02:21] <poolkey172> soundray : thanks for correcting me
[02:21] <poolkey172> doh
[02:21] <phpnuborn> ok..
[02:21] <rag> roh: is there grub.conf on alternate cd?
[02:21] <rag> roh: in alternate cd?
[02:21] <rag> roh: i dont know
[02:21] <XiXaQ> In System Monitor, what is the difference between Memory and Resident Memory?
[02:21] <rag> roh: is there?
[02:21] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : can u even log into x windows ?
[02:22] <roh> I don't know anything about the alternate cd, but on my desktop machine the file is "/boot/menu.lst"
[02:22] <phpnuborn> yes..  poolkey172
[02:23] <rag> roh: no i need pass parameters on installation , not on already system installed, ok?
[02:23] <phpnuborn> it boots into it automatically
[02:23] <rag> roh: thanks
[02:23] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : cool then what do u not like or what problems are u experiencing ?
[02:24] <phpnuborn> i want this 'turnkey'  distro to boot into text mode
[02:24] <poolkey172> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ic
[02:24] <phpnuborn> not the  xubuntu  xfce gui
[02:24] <poolkey172> that should be easy
[02:24] <phpnuborn> so i did the ctrl-alt-f1 thing
[02:24] <poolkey172> I'm going to do the very quick hack
[02:24] <roh> phpnuborn, so you want to boot into a different runlevel? one that doesn't run an X display manager?
[02:25] <Luke> mawx: thanks for confirming. yes they will be sent to me. if I report they are automatically CCed to the author
[02:25] <gorski> can i resize fat32 partitions with qtparted?
[02:25] <phpnuborn> roh, yes
[02:25] <tripppy> roh, how do i make it run another script? and how do i run it from the gui?
[02:25] <Byan> hey, anyone here know how ipv6 works more then me...?
[02:25] <Byan> cause I got a broker working..
[02:25] <Byan> and it's confusing me
[02:25] <phpnuborn> but i don't want to hunt for files to edit..
[02:26] <runes> If I wanted a symlink in the users folder that shows up in ftp session what do I do.  I tried ln -s /media/ftp/Internet_downloads downloads  the link shows when I browse locally but not in ftp
[02:26] <gorski> do i need to unmount the partition first, 'cause it want to resize mounted?
[02:26] <gorski> can i resize fat32 partitions with qtparted?
[02:27] <highneko> When I use vncviewer I can see my remote desktop but the panels load for a second then keep dissapearing. I's unusable Here's a screenshot http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f295/numbers6554/Screenshot2.png any ideas?
[02:27] <roh> phpnuborn, if you want a gui way to disable the gui, you can use the "Services" config application
[02:27] <poolkey172> phpnuborn : settings > boot-up manager
[02:27] <boggle> gorski: no idea about gparted, but there is ntfsresize in ntfsprogs
[02:27] <boggle> gorski: in general, unmounting a partition and having a backup of your disk is advisable when resizing any
[02:28] <boggle> gorski: partition, no matter what type
[02:28] <soundray> phpnuborn: System-Administration-Services. Disable gdm. On next boot, you'll get text mode only.
[02:29] <openexit> hey.. How can i configure X to use a screensaver (xlock)
[02:29] <roh> i think xubuntu uses xdm instead of gdm, but it'll be much the same

[02:39] <sod75> soundray: uh, that directory doesn't exist, I'm on dapper btw
[02:39] <VigoFusion> soundray: Oh, its a command line thing, lemee check my UNIX book, (I have a VERY old one.)
[02:39] <sod75> soundray: sorry, copy paste error
[02:39] <soundray> sod75: you need to replace 'packagename' with the name of the package you are interested in.
[02:40] <openexit> soundray - well no.. I want to set xlock (with -nolock mode on, i.e its a screensaver) to run after a certain amount of inactivity
[02:41] <VigoFusion> soundray: srry, this manual is incorrect one,,,,
[02:42] <openexit> soundray - aparently it works the same way as xscreensaver does.. I just dont know how to configure X to run the app after x amount of inactivity
[02:42] <p_masho> HELP!! can I recover a directory I deleted with rm -f -r *
[02:42] <hesperia> hi guys :)
[02:43] <hesperia> how can i disable  IPv6 in the LiveCD?
[02:43] <boggle> p_masho: that's kind of tricky. Best you turn off the box before any of that free disk space is reused

[02:44] <sod75> p_masho: if your filesystem ext3, probably not, ext2 , what boggle just said
[02:44] <boggle> p_masho: I've never used e2undel, but recovered succesfully some files with debugfs.
[02:44] <hesperia> gosh, net feels slow...
[02:45] <VigoFusion> soundray: Whats the command to Lock Screen in Graphic Mode? its also a sudo | command~thingy,,,it prolly work in Text.
[02:45] <boggle> p_masho + sod75: http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/30/1652211, no idea if it works
[02:46] <boggle> only works when a process was still accessing the file though
[02:47] <openexit> yeah its installed
[02:47] <openexit> oooh i see
[02:47] <poolkey172> xscreensaver-command -lock
[02:47] <openexit> so xautolock is a daemon that checks for idle sessions
[02:47] <openexit> and launchs a program...
[02:48] <soundray> openexit: that's how I understand it
[02:48] <openexit> i thought you could configure X to do this directly
[02:49] <openexit> alrightly... let me five this a go then

[02:56] <nom> Hello how ca go?
[02:56] <elTigre> hi
[02:56] <elTigre> I have some show-stopping problems in my edgy installation....
[02:57] <elTigre> for example I can't run python gtk programs, and the /boot/grub/menu.lst is made unbootable whenever dpkg touches
[02:57] <elTigre> it
[02:57] <Crescendo> When trying to connect to an ubuntu machine via vnc, I get the following: "ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::SystemException: read: Connection reset by peer (104)"
[02:58] <wspinto_> how to change the runlevel in ubuntu 6.10?
[02:59] <soundray> elTigre: which python gtk program can't you run? Is it homemade?
[02:59] <Duesentrieb> hi all - after half a day of digging around, i finally got k3b to work with my laptop. now i'd like to share the info on the ubuntu wiki, but i'm unsure about local structures and customs. Would I simply edit https://help.ubuntu.com/community/K3BHowto ? and what's the difference between help.ubuntu.com and wiki.ubuntu.com?
[02:59] <elTigre> gnome-sudoku and everything else
[02:59] <elTigre> I also can't import gtk from the python interpreter
[02:59] <Duesentrieb> I'm too used to the wikipedia way, i guess...
[03:00] <EDinNY> wspinto_, you mean initial runlevel, or runlevel after your system boots?
[03:00] <soundray> elTigre: did you upgrade or install afresh?
[03:00] <Duesentrieb> anyone around with experience on the ubuntu wiki?
[03:00] <elTigre> upgrade
[03:00] <sod75> Duesentrieb: no idea personally, but I'd just go ahead, they can always move it :)
[03:01] <soundray> elTigre: did you install ubuntu-desktop before you did so?
[03:01] <elTigre> and no, I won't reinstall ubuntu... my disk drive literally eats boot disks....
[03:01] <sod75> Duesentrieb: info at a wrong place is still better then no infi
[03:01] <elTigre> I made sure to
[03:01] <Duesentrieb> sod75: true. Be Bold, and all that :P
[03:01] <soundray> elTigre: does 'sudo apt-get -f install' report any incomplete installs?
[03:01] <elTigre> I think I installed xubuntu-desktop
[03:02] <elTigre> yes, python-setuptool

[03:02] <Celldweller> but i refuse to be a self install dumbass
[03:02] <elTigre> no, at the moment I can't....
[03:02] <EkUmBa> hello there
[03:03] <elTigre> I have to rerun that
[03:03] <EkUmBa> does anyone know,how to install win xp on a ubuntu system without problems?
[03:03] <elTigre> and that will take quite a while usually
[03:03] <soundray> elTigre: rerun what?
[03:03] <nom> Why you re-lays not? You it is because I am French!
[03:03] <elTigre> apt-get -f install
[03:04] <Crescendo> EkUmBa, use a seperate HDD.
[03:04] <elTigre> well now there aren't any errors
[03:04] <EkUmBa> i just have ONE
[03:04] <nom> Who speaks French?
[03:04] <soundray> elTigre: if that takes long to run, you haven't finished your installation properly.

[03:04] <ubotu> nom: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[03:04] <elTigre> the python-setuptools thing comes up whenever I install new packages
[03:04] <sod75> EkUmBa: it generally is easier to do it the other way around, as ubuntu will leave you windows and provide a bott method for bot, windows install do not play so nice with already present other OSes
[03:05] <soundray> elTigre: that's why you need to fix it. I could help you fix it if you pasted the output I asked you for.
[03:05] <EkUmBa> hmm...so i can forget it :-(
[03:05] <elTigre> apt-get -f install exits cleanly now...
[03:05] <elTigre> I will try to install some package to provoke an error
[03:05] <sod75> EkUmBa: no, but you have to know how to do it....
[03:06] <EkUmBa> and how do i do it without a hdd crash,followed by reforamt issues :-)..is it difficult to handle?
[03:06] <soundray> EkUmBa: if you have a sufficiently sized free primary partition, you should be okay. Just fix grub afterwards.
[03:07] <soundray> elTigre: now, what happens to your menu.lst?
[03:07] <EkUmBa> well,let me explain the main problem,why i want to install xp.i have a program,which makes a cd self check.but this program is just for win nt/xp.so,wine can't hande it....so i tried
[03:07] <EkUmBa> didn't work out
[03:07] <EkUmBa> any ideas?
[03:07] <elTigre> kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=UUID=5b6b4d05-1ce9-4eb4-bc7f-aadb32b6c9b5 ro quiet splash
[03:07] <soundray> EkUmBa: what is a CD self check?
[03:08] <EkUmBa> well...the program looks,if it is the original cd,which it is
[03:08] <elTigre> I changed another entry to boot me into my system....
[03:08] <EkUmBa> but with wine,it doesn't work...somehow
[03:10] <Manse> with wine do what?

[03:10] <sod75> EkUmBa: you can look into vmware, better then a full install

[03:10] <sod75> they have some good/ free/trial options
[03:10] <DevC> hmm can't seem to uprade from 5.10 to 6.06 for some reason. cat /etc/issue says breezy badger5.10  but when I follow the directions for going to 6.06 I do the updates and still end up with 5.10 when I'm done :-/
[03:10] <CokeNCode> they are asf vids, from my camcorder
[03:10] <soundray> elTigre: can you pastebin the whole file?
[03:11] <CokeNCode> preferably something i can 'apt-get install'
[03:11] <sod75> DevC: did you do a dist-upgrade ?
[03:11] <soundray> DevC: what's the output from uname -a ?
[03:11] <elTigre> ok
[03:12] <Manse> anyone running qq with wine?
[03:13] <EkUmBa> the problem is,that the cd has a copy protection,that controls the data on the cd directly with the hardware.so,an emulator will have its problems

[03:14] <ubotu> DevC: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:14] <Kaptah> can't apt-get lilo
[03:14] <Manse> repo?
[03:14] <sod75> EDinNY: ed is also a command, so maybe that's why
[03:14] <soundray> Kaptah: apt-get install lilo
[03:15] <DevC> sod75 I've been following the Upgrades site that they have up on ubuntu and I did the Breezy 5.10 upgrade now I'm tryin to do the 6.06 so I can go to the new 6.10
[03:15] <DevC> soundray been reading those and following them already
[03:15] <Manse> why not grub
[03:15] <Kaptah> "Package lilo is not available... "
[03:15] <p_masho> which device is the floppy disk by default ? /dev/fd0

[03:16] <EDinNY> sod75, rh and susa named my machine from the DNS
[03:16] <Kaptah> i got rid of grub. had an guide to dual boot and it was for lilo
[03:16] <sod75> EDinNY: i said maybe :)
[03:16] <EkUmBa> well,anyway thanks
[03:17] <soundray> Kaptah: you shouldn't follow any guides that aren't ubuntu-specific if there are ubuntu-specific ones around.
[03:17] <Kaptah> LiLo 'cause it presevers xp boot loader
[03:17] <soundray> Kaptah: you don't need XP's boot loader in the MBR if you have grub.
[03:17] <Kaptah> ok, i should use grub
[03:18] <soundray> !dualboot | Kaptah

[03:19] <Kaptah> do you know if this works in case of xp SP3,4,5... updates
[03:19] <DevC> I've done what the site says for going to 6.06 and rebooted but it still says issue is 5.10 and not 6.06
[03:19] <Manse> 6.10 has released
[03:19] <Kaptah> ..meaning boot sequences won't change
[03:20] <soundray> DevC: can you give me the URL of the page that you are following
[03:20] <DevC> Manse: yeah but to upgrade you have to go 5.04 to 5.10 to 6.06 to 6.10
[03:20] <DevC> http://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades
[03:21] <soundray> Kaptah: yes, the instructions will work. In the worst case, you will have to follow another HOWTO for rescuing grub.
[03:21] <AngryElf_> Why is it that firefox Crtl+Scroll Wheel Zooming feature works so much better in Winblows than ubuntu and can it be fixed?

[03:22] <Kaptah> can I tell Grub to build it's boot sector not in the MBR, but /dev/sda6 ?
[03:22] <soundray> elTigre: what's your root partition device name?
[03:23] <elTigre> /dev/hda8
=== SteveC is now known as ssssss
[03:23] <Ranbee> hi, can the normal ubuntu install (as opposed to the alternate install) let you put grub on a floppy?
[03:24] <soundray> elTigre: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34358/ (changed the kopt line). Change your menu.lst accordingly and run 'sudo update-grub'.
[03:25] <soundray> elTigre: erm, do you have separate root and boot partitions?
[03:26] <elTigre> I had separate root and boot partitions
[03:26] <elTigre> however I changed that
[03:26] <elTigre> I continously ran into trouble because of no disk space left
[03:27] <soundray> elTigre: okay, that's the reason why update-grub did the wrong thing for you. If you make the change I suggested, and you have /boot on /dev/hda8, it will be fine.

[03:35] <soundray> Skello: I think you may be able to use firestarter for that.

[03:35] <stefg> EkUmBa: /j #vmware
[03:35] <soundray> !ask
[03:35] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:35] <sod75> EkUmBa: vmware let's you install any (supported) os in a virtual machine
[03:36] <sod75> EkUmBa: it's non-free though
[03:36] <LadyNikon> there is a part of the bot that is programmed for that
[03:36] <LadyNikon> ha
[03:36] <Skello> soundray i have installed firestarter, however i don't see an option for setting routes, i only have options for NAT/port forwarding
[03:36] <Duesentrieb> EkUmBa: the player needs an existing vm. if you need to create a vm, you have to install the vmware server.
[03:36] <Vigor> Am I back?
[03:36] <Vigor> YAY!
[03:36] <soundray> Vigor: no
[03:36] <EkUmBa> so,...i just can install win xp with vmware?
[03:36] <Vigor> Oh heck, I aint?
[03:37] <Vigor> arrrghhhhh
[03:37] <sod75> EkUmBa: yes
[03:37] <soundray> Vigor: sry, that joke is "de rigeur" in here
[03:37] <Duesentrieb> EkUmBa: the "vm" is a simulated computer, including dives, network cards, a simulated bios, etc. you can install pretty much anything.
[03:37] <Vigor> Aye
[03:37] <EkUmBa> where do i get these vmx files?
[03:37] <Duesentrieb> you create them using the server
[03:37] <Skello> soundray could it be because i'm not running Ubuntu on that particular network setup yet ? with 3 devices, two for internet, one for LAN ? i'm running on a test box now with a single NIC just to make sure i have the tools i need to achieve this
[03:37] <anto> how do i un "rar " a filename.ro1 ?
[03:37] <EkUmBa> vmx for win xp especially
[03:38] <sod75> EkUmBa: http://www.vmware.com/
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> EkUmBa: only the server version allows you to create/define a new virtual pc. the player just lets you access existing ones.
[03:38] <EkUmBa> yes,i have looked there,but haven't found any vmx for win xp
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> the server is free for linux
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> you don't doewnload a vmx.
[03:38] <Duesentrieb> you install the server and create it
[03:39] <Duesentrieb> note that vmware has to be compiled for your system. but the installer is pretty decent, if the command line doesn't scare you
[03:39] <soundray> Skello: I don't think I can be of any help there. Maybe ask the channel again.
[03:40] <Skello> soundray sure np, i appreciate the effort though, thanks
[03:40] <Vigor> This is fun, relearning all this stuff is neato skeeto
[03:40] <Duesentrieb> anyway... as a note to the general public:
[03:40] <Duesentrieb> got problems with cdrecord? use libburn + cdrskin
[03:41] <Duesentrieb> works perfectly for me :)
[03:41] <cute_killer> where i can softs

[03:41] <LordMetroid> Hm, I tried to find a package for LaTeX but could only find latex-base for 2.09 which is obsolete according to the package manager?

[03:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about intel - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:53] <norgul> i'm running ubuntu
[03:54] <Vigor> norgul: Is it set up on a Slave with WinXP?
[03:54] <norgul> nope

[03:55] <Cyberai> I installed a new Linksys Wireless PCI card yesterday and set it up using nswrapper. But it has a hard time seeing my base station 20 feet away and loses connection constantly. it also looses its config if rebooted. Does anyone have any recommendations for me to fix this?
[03:55] <yanger> what causes resolve.conf to change? I set it up, but every now and then, it gets reset to a setting that won't work thus my server can't dns correctly until i adjust resolve.conf again...
[03:55] <norgul> i erased the whole disk
[03:56] <Vigor> norgul: uhm, you cant just erase XP, you can, but there is a trick to it.
[03:57] <norgul> god, i hate winxp
[03:57] <Vigor> !wireless
[03:57] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[03:57] <norgul> so now i have done something stupid?
[03:58] <Vigor> norgul: Naw, just look at Fred Langas site, or some site you trust and know on how to REMOVE winXP
[03:58] <Guerrand> norgul... dont worry stupidity is a common problem for me :P
[03:58] <sod75> yanger: DHCP might server send dns config overwrinting yours ?
[03:58] <norgul> i habe already removed windows
[03:59] <Vigor> I thought I had also, that drive is in the garbage now.
[03:59] <norgul> really?
[03:59] <sod75> Vigor: why ?
[04:00] <sod75> what's so special about XP that a format won't fix ?
[04:00] <norgul> fuck, i'm getting very angry on microsoft now
[04:00] <Vigor> WinXP has a nasty way of locking itself into the BIOS, especially a Factory Install
[04:00] <norgul> w8
[04:00] <norgul> i have an extra disk here
[04:00] <norgul> i can replace it
[04:01] <sod75> Vigor: that still doesn mess up you hd , would it ? and just flash your bios then
[04:01] <norgul> one thing, i installed edgy yesterday and it worked nice. apt updated nicely and so on
[04:01] <norgul> beryl ran nice
[04:01] <Vigor> Ok, I left mine on, I dont access it much, and I shrunk its partition down to minimum, its there, I just dont use it, much
[04:01] <norgul> so did i switch screen to lcd 27"
[04:02] <norgul> tv
[04:02] <norgul> but the resolution got fucked up, so i installed edgy at new
[04:02] <norgul> and now it is crappy
=== jk__ is now known as jk
[04:02] <Vigor> sod75: Its not really a flash, well it is, but its a goofy one
[04:03] <norgul> lemme see
[04:03] <Vigor> Language please.
[04:03] <norgul> what?
[04:03] <Vigor> 2 many open windows

[04:04] <Crescendo> When trying to connect to an ubuntu machine via vnc, I get the following: "ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::SystemException: read: Connection reset by peer (104)"
[04:04] <norgul> i can replace that one with that i have in the computer now
[04:05] <Vigor> Set the XP one as Main in BIOS, yes its a Microsoft thing, set the Ubuntu as a Slave
[04:06] <norgul> but i dont have xp
[04:06] <Vigor> What system did you have?
[04:06] <norgul> the other hdd is clean
[04:06] <Vigor> Oh neaters
[04:07] <norgul> the hdd i'm using now is using ubuntu
[04:07] <TheWheat> hey guys i've upgraded from kubuntu dapper to edgy and now when I try ctrl+alt+f1 instead of showing the console the screen just shows some funny lines and stuff. anybody know whats up with that? it worked perfectly b4 the upgrade
[04:07] <norgul> has got ubuntu*
[04:08] <abes> oh that was a violent lag!

[04:09] <abes> is it common that wi-fi likes to "spike" or it's just my router? :P
[04:10] <yanger> sod75, i'll have to check that.. the dhcp server is a m0n0wall server ;/ so... maybe...
[04:10] <norgul> the hdd i have next to me has 120 gb
[04:10] <Vigor> abes: Depends on the WiFi Signal, alotta times
[04:11] <beasty> you gota love my wifi range
[04:11] <abes> kaur: does it have anything to do with hibernating?
[04:11] <Coffee502> n'abend zusammen
[04:11] <abes> Vigor: well it seems like it works weird over wi-fi all the time....
[04:11] <abes> Vigor: let me check another router on another network... brb
[04:11] <norgul> should i try to install ubuntu again?
[04:12] <Vigor> abes: It could be any number of things ,honestly, all I know about WiFi is what I know learned in HAM,LORAN,VHF and Broadcasting
[04:12] <kaur> abes: hibernating works after some modifications but the cpu is way too hot. That is the main problem, because I'm using a laptop
[04:12] <norgul> i'll give it a try
[04:12] <norgul> see ya

[04:14] <icheyne> which cd rippers are you boys using?
[04:14] <tux75> anybody can help me with a "unknown FAIL_DELAY" error, pls?
[04:15] <marlun> Why can't I find mozilla-mplayer in the repositories anymore? I've uncommented every repository in the source.list.

[04:16] <Crescendo> turbopc, yep, I've looked at that one.
[04:16] <gbw> a link for me please =)
[04:16] <tux75> what about a FAIL_DELAY error, friends?
[04:17] <turbopc> tux75: have u checked http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-276858.html ?
[04:17] <Vigor> gbw: I have a nasty cold or something, am very slow today,,,well am slow everyday, but twice bad this day
[04:17] <turbopc> Btw... I just received my UBUNTU MUG and HOODIE!!!! w00t! w00t! :P
[04:17] <turbopc> Vigor: lol :P
[04:17] <gbw> Vigor, wish you healthy
[04:18] <roh> tux75, when do you get the FAIL_DELAY error?
[04:18] <turbopc> Vigor: I hope you have an antivirus ;] 
[04:18] <grunger> wtf? "sudo : unable to execute /usr/bin/eciadsl-config-tk: No such file or directory". But there is ! Why doesn't it work !
[04:18] <tux75> roh, i get this error whe i try to log in a terminal or in a console..
[04:18] <Vigor> My AV scrip just expired
[04:18] <tux75> turbopc, i seen the forum you suggest me, but it doesn't offer any solution..
[04:18] <Yoric> Hi.
[04:19] <soundray> grunger: it's not finding another file or directory referenced inside that script.
[04:19] <p_masho> now do I make my removable USB drive writable by root ?
[04:19] <Yoric> I just realized that my computer comes with a so-called "Smart card keyboard", including a smart card reader. Does anyone know where to look for more information on this ? That is drivers, applications, APIs...
[04:19] <soundray> p_masho: what filesystem is on that drive?
[04:19] <tux75> roh, whe* whenever (sorry)
[04:19] <Vigor> masho: Give the USB sudo privelages?
[04:19] <turbopc> p_masho: where is the USB mounted?
[04:20] <GionnyBoss> hi all :)
[04:20] <roh> tux75, Google tells me that there is a bug filed for it and that there is a workaround https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/73024
[04:20] <turbopc> p_masho: you can just use chmod -R 755 /dev/usb or wherever u have it mounted
[04:20] <gbw> Vigor, btw, do you know what i meant? for example ubuntu is shipped with  applications like firefox, i want to have my own created ubuntu cd whiich will installed webserver if people use it to install ubuntu
[04:21] <soundray> Yoric: search the web for terms like 'manufacturer model smartcard linux'
[04:21] <Eri> hola
[04:21] <soundray> Yoric: sometimes it can be useful to look up the USB id with lsusb and stfw for that.
[04:21] <GionnyBoss> can anybody help me letting my Canon scanner work under Ubuntu 6.10, please? xsane seems not to recognise it (and I read that unfortunately Canon scanner are not officially supported under Linux) ... does anybody have the same problem and solved it?
[04:21] <Yoric> soundray: sounds like a plan, thanks.
[04:21] <Eri> i need help with cedega
[04:21] <tux75> roh, so i just need to comment the line of /etc/login.defs? and what it happen then? really the FAIL_DELAY is not necessary?
[04:22] <turbopc> GionnyBoss: what is the exact model of the scanner?
[04:22] <AnthonyG> Hello everyone :D
[04:22] <soundray> GionnyBoss: you should look up the latest news about your scanner on the sane website
[04:22] <turbopc> AnthonyG: Hello :P
[04:22] <Vigor> gbw: Yes. I understood that, I would suggest useing the ShipIt method. Across lines Installs are great, but the ShipIt method is better cause then they get their own Install CDs, unlike some companies....
[04:23] <GionnyBoss> CanoScan LIDE370
[04:23] <grunger> anybody got eciadsl working on Edgy Eft?
[04:23] <Celldweller> ecaidsl?
[04:23] <GionnyBoss> soundray, ok, I go and check on SANE website now
[04:23] <AnthonyG> I may have found the solution to my modem problems (After many pots of coffee and searching) , Would http://ltmodem.heby.de/martian-full-20061110.tar.gz   be sufficient for my AgereSystems V.92 56K Modem?
[04:23] <r000t> could someone please help me understand a problem with mysql replication .. i have configured master/slave and when i try  "LOAD DATA FROM MASTER;"  i get "Access denied for user 'slave_user'@'testserver' (using password: YES)"
[04:23] <gbw> Vigor, what is ShipIt method?
[04:23] <grunger> modem drivers for GlobanSpan chipset
[04:23] <DevC> ok back and still no closer to figuring out why I can't upgrade from 5.10 to 6.06 following the upgrade notes for Dapper Drake
[04:24] <GionnyBoss> you know, this thing is very important for me... untill I can't get this scanner work under Ubuntu, my father will keep using Windows... and I'm trying to convince him that Linux is so much better :P
[04:24] <gbw> !shipit
[04:24] <ubotu> shipit is a service that sends free Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu CDs. See http://shipit.ubuntu.com/ and http://shipit.kubuntu.org and http://shipit.edubuntu.org - Shipit will not send Edgy (6.10) CDs, but only Dapper (6.06) CDs, as Dapper is a !LTS release.
[04:24] <Vigor> Oh
[04:24] <icheyne> which cd rippers are you boys using?
[04:24] <gbw> Vigor, i see, but that is not i want, with ship it, i will get only pre configured cd
[04:24] <tux75> anybody can explain me why my swap result with a priority=-1? (mangage suggest into 0 and 32767)
[04:25] <Vigor> Yes, gotcha
[04:25] <gbw> i want to add extra apps and then burn it in a new iso cd
[04:25] <r000t> noone here understand mysql master/slave configurations then huh :(
[04:25] <soundray> GionnyBoss: if it needs convincing, it'll be tough. People have to discover it for themselves.
[04:25] <Celldweller> rOOOOt
[04:25] <Celldweller> no
[04:25] <Celldweller> i dont think so
[04:25] <Celldweller> forums are really good to check in tho
[04:25] <AnthonyG> grunger: Was that directed at me? Those drivers are for Kernel > 2.12.* and Lucent/Agere chipsets :)
[04:25] <mseney> is ebay the best place to get a 700 Mhz Laptop for the best price?
[04:26] <sod75> DevC: if your /home/is on a seperate partition you could you do a clean install of 6.10 without loosing your files (do a backup though if you can)
[04:26] <personal> jooos
[04:26] <DevC> the update package is looking at Breezy, do I need to change that like I did for got from 5.06 to 5.10
[04:26] <tux75> anybody can explain me why my swap result with a priority=-1, while the mangage suggest into 0 and 32767??
[04:27] <Celldweller> because you swapped it wrong
[04:27] <norgul> back
[04:27] <GionnyBoss> soundray, that's true! but I guess that he is discovering it by itself, he tryed to use Ubuntu on my computer and he found it fast, simple... he just doesn't care very much about it... he just needs that things work... but you know, I'm trying to tell him that if things works well with both for him, why shouldn't he use and support Linux and the good philosophy that there is behind it?
[04:27] <soundray> tux75: don't repeat, rephrase (and correct your typos in the process)
[04:28] <norgul> *erase the entire disk*
[04:28] <GionnyBoss> soundray, sorry for my awful english (I'm italian)

[04:30] <soundray> GionnyBoss: http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl

[04:34] <poolkey172> soz soundray
[04:34] <tux75> soundray, can you help me?
[04:34] <soundray> poolkey172: how did you arrive at this situation?
[04:34] <Nick1> I'm back agian, I already install ubuntu cd 6.06 LTS but it show "Missing OS".....how can I do?
[04:34] <Vigor> gbw: Totally understand, You can vnc to them and install as you like, but then again, certain laws apply to certain countries, thank you again microsoft for not allowing freedom of access on an Internet.
[04:34] <poolkey172> I installed grub-install /dev/fd0
[04:34] <fnf> poolkey172: Can you push a LiveCD which has GRUB and do a GRUB reinstall ?
[04:34] <soundray> tux75: no, since I don't understand your question. That's why I suggested rephrasing it.
[04:35] <poolkey172> fnf : ok I'll try but I got the feeling the livecd does not give me all my devices
[04:35] <tux75> ok, sorry.
[04:35] <gbw> Vigor, what you said is irrelevant, i told you, i will just install free apps like apache, mysql, php
[04:35] <poolkey172> fnf : from the livecd I just do grub-install /dev/fd0 ?
[04:36] <tux75> if i type: swapon -s it say:
[04:36] <Vigor> gbw: On your machine, just use the Synaptic Package Manager.
[04:36] <tux75> /dev/hda6                   partition       1028120 0       -1
[04:36] <tux75> where priority= -1
=== Gh0sty_ is now known as Gh0sty
[04:36] <gbw> Vigor, can i do it after that to a install cd?
[04:36] <gerson> hello
[04:36] <Vigor> gbw: Yes
[04:36] <tux75> but in man swapon i read that priority must to be between 0 and 32767
[04:36] <fnf> poolkey172: Do you intend to use the floppy on any other machines ?
[04:36] <mrson> buenas
[04:37] <poolkey172> fnf : no I need to test my installation
[04:37] <tux75> so, what it mean this different priority? and how to fix this problem?
[04:37] <gbw> Vigor, let me check
[04:37] <tux75> soundray, did you understand now?
[04:37] <paradizelost> anyone fix blank screen in vmware console under Xgl/Beryl?
[04:38] <gerson> The one who knows of a program to programme games
[04:38] <fnf> poolkey172: Ok, so that's a bit easier, you need to temporarily mount your target root partition into LiveCD "/" directory
[04:38] <Hobbsee> !pbuilder > jpetso
[04:38] <mrson> buenas
[04:38] <poolkey172> fnf : ok
[04:38] <soundray> tux75: I'm still not clear what the problem is. Why do you worry about the priority? Swap should either work or not. Only if it doesn't work, there's a problem.
[04:38] <gbw> Vigor, i cant find any option in synaptic which can allow me to do that
[04:39] <fnf> poolkey172: The thing is, without a root/boot partition mounted, GRUB have no way to figure out what is your drive geometry to build the correct menu.lst
[04:39] <tux75> ok, and so what is this priority? and how can i know if swap work properlly?
[04:39] <mrson> alguien me puede decir como conectarme a internet con el puerto usb???
[04:39] <poolkey172> fnf : but thats where the problem is : when I mount my filesystem chroot to it : grub-install dont work

[04:40] <abes> tiptip: in google videos you can just choose to save it
[04:40] <fnf> poolkey172: AFAIK, you don't need to chroot into the new environment if you mount it as I do.

[04:51] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, what do you mean by can't boot your computer?
[04:52] <ifrozen> hali
[04:52] <sod75> kenThomson3: get the livecd, boot from that to repair it
[04:52] <Celldweller> Ken Whatsisname that is an option
[04:53] <Celldweller> or you could tell us why it wont boot up or where it gets to
[04:53] <der0b> paradizelost: have you tried entering an 'xhost +' and then doing the gksudo vmware?
[04:53] <soundray> eimajenthat: do the two machines access different DNS servers?
[04:53] <fnf> poolkey172: How's the situation ? The link I've seen seems to prefer the manual way, which could be better as grub-install assumes a lot of things.
[04:53] <paradizelost> and by "cant boot my computer" do you mean you cant get to windows?
[04:53] <kenThomson3> OK, i installed Ubuntu on hd1, i am having windows on hd0. I put the GRUB on hd1. Than i removed the windows HDD, and put in hd1. Then i got the GRUB screen on booting, but whenever i selected any option i got the message "Error 21:selected disk doesnot exist"
[04:53] <paradizelost> der0b, no, so xhost + gksudo  vmware?

[04:54] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, that's beacuse grub would be referring to /boot on (hd1,1) and it's now (hd0,1)
[04:54] <poolkey172> fnf : :/
[04:54] <paradizelost> because you removed a drive

[04:54] <Celldweller> sorry
[04:54] <soundray> kenThomson3: when you remove the first HD after installing grub on the second one, grub will get confused because the disk addresses have changed.

[04:55] <Celldweller> is it configured correctly

[04:55] <eimajenthat> soundray: In windows, you can get the DNS from the network connection properties, but I don't knw how to do it in linux
[04:55] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, you need to put a hard drive back in, and it will work
[04:55] <fnf> kenThomson3: Depends on how you removed the partition, the order of the partitions may have been shufftled, in which case you need to correct the menu
[04:55] <Celldweller> abes.... configuration?
[04:55] <soundray> eimajenthat: 'cat /etc/resolv.conf'
[04:55] <paradizelost> fnf, he removed a whole drive
[04:55] <abes> Celldweller: hmmm... what do you mean?
[04:56] <kenThomson3> soundray: Celldweller: paradizelost: But Ubuntu still is on hd1. It's reference in the GRUB hasn't changed. SO i should be able to boot it up, right?
[04:56] <fnf> paradizelost: Ouch.
[04:56] <sod75> kenThomson3: mount you hd in knoppix and edit that /wherever you mounted/boot/grub/menu.list
[04:56] <abes> Celldweller: everything seems to be ok... shuld be working... but it doesnt :)
[04:56] <eimajenthat> soundray: gracias
[04:56] <Celldweller> correct
[04:56] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, no, you need to edit menu.lst to reference the new hard drive position
[04:56] <soundray> kenThomson3: no, if you removed hd0, the former hd1 becomes hd0
[04:56] <Celldweller> hmmm
[04:56] <paradizelost> THEN it will boot
[04:56] <Celldweller> i still say get the live cd
[04:56] <Celldweller> and run linux recovery
[04:56] <sod75> kenThomson3: the first disk it finds becomes hd0
[04:56] <abes> Celldweller: evrything installed according to manuals (libdvdcss2 + w32codecs) but it still doesnt work... :?
[04:56] <gerson> ya instalaste el paquete de gdesklets
[04:57] <paradizelost> so basically, go edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change everything that says (hd1)  to say (hd0)
[04:57] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: If i put the windows HD back in, it will simply boot Windows, as grub is not installed on the Windows HDD! I am having GRUB ONLY on the UBuntu HDD
[04:57] <dabaR> abes: abes and you restarted totem?
[04:57] <soundray> Celldweller: he needs to understand the problem first. At least superficially.
[04:57] <Celldweller> yea
[04:57] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, you can change the boot order
[04:57] <Celldweller> abes... w32 codecs?

[04:57] <fnf> kenThomson3: Will you plug both HDDs and set it to boot on Ubuntu HDD ?
[04:57] <abes> Celldweller: w32 codecs here
[04:58] <soundray> paradizelost: that won't be enough for booting. All the root entries and fstab need to be changed as well.
[04:58] <der0b> major42: history -c
[04:58] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, but go in, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change every instance of (hd1,0) to (hd0,0)

[04:58] <soundray> eimajenthat: those entries aren't the important ones. "nameserver" ones are.
[04:58] <eimajenthat> soundray: and then both say "nameserver 192.168.11.1"

[04:59] <Celldweller> it will upgrade to edgy over a LONG period of time
[04:59] <abes> Celldweller: VLC does work... but doesnt play DVDs
[04:59] <poolkey172> fnf : lets se if this junk works
[05:00] <Celldweller> doesnt play dvd's...
[05:00] <Celldweller> does it give you an error?
[05:00] <eimajenthat> soundray: pointing at my router, which is odd, because I didn't think it could be a dns server
[05:00] <fnf> poolkey172: Alright :)
[05:00] <dabaR> DevC: cat /etc/issue
[05:00] <paradizelost> eimajenthat, is it a linksys?
[05:00] <abes> Celldweller: just doesnt seem to do anything when i want to play a DVD
[05:00] <soundray> eimajenthat: it probably is a DNS forwarder
[05:00] <poolkey172> fnf : cool loading stage2
[05:00] <DevC> paradizelost: according to what I've read it only updates by 5.04 -> 5.10 -> 6.06 -> 6.10 and I'm at the middle
[05:00] <paradizelost> eimajenthat, a lot of the routers will forward dns
[05:00] <MaJoR42> Where's the best place to solve xvid problems? I've been through most of the stuff I could find in forums, but I can't get the settings to stick.
[05:00] <eimajenthat> paradizelost: no, Buffalo
[05:00] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: Celldweller: fnf: sod75: People editing all these files seems to tricky for me. I wish to re-install everything. Here is how i want it. hd0 (Ubuntu, with GRUB on hd0 Only), hd1 (Windows, with NO GRUB ON HD1). SO than can someone tell me a newbie-friendly 'correct' way of installing Ubuntu for such a requirement?
[05:00] <Celldweller> in your VLC preferences
[05:01] <Celldweller> read them of to me
[05:01] <gerson> mrson ya
[05:01] <Rprp> Hi, how can i make '.deb' file?
[05:01] <Rprp> s
[05:01] <DevC> dabaR: cat /etc/issue -> Ubuntu 5.10 "Breezy Badger" \n \l
[05:01] <sod75> kenThomson3: the just boot from the cd and do so
[05:01] <Vigor> sal: Did you try the Device Manager use (this) as default? or is it listed?
[05:01] <dabaR> Rprp: out of what?
[05:01] <abes> Celldweller: all of them? or any particular "tab"?
[05:01] <fatbrain> What player shoudl I use when I want to play .rm videos?
[05:01] <sod75> kenThomson3: just don't wtart changeing hd's after
[05:01] <kenThomson3> SO that after installing everything GRUB comes up on booting asking me to select any OS, and if i remove the Ubuntu HDD, THAN THE WIndows one, boots like nothing ever happened
[05:01] <soundray> kenThomson3: that setup is too complex for a newbie to do without unexpected side effects.
[05:01] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, hookk the drives up how you want them, then install ubuntu on the first hard drive, with windows currently installed on the second hard drive
[05:01] <Celldweller> second tab i think
[05:01] <paradizelost> and it will magically work
[05:01] <dabaR> DevC: and cat /etc/apt/sources.list shows dapper in all lines?
[05:01] <sal> vigor: hold on let me look in the device manager
[05:01] <gerson> Mrson already
[05:01] <Celldweller> no
[05:01] <fnf> kenThomson3: If you don't feel comfortable with GRUB, you may reboot to Ubuntu then do a 'grub-update', that'll do it.
[05:02] <paradizelost> but please, do NOT change drives around AFTER you have stuff installed
[05:02] <nosbig> fatbrain, mplayer...
[05:02] <Celldweller> input and codecs
[05:02] <abes> Celldweller:  "Video" or "Input / Codecs"
[05:02] <soundray> kenThomson3: I say, leave ubuntu on hd1, leave windows on hd0, and put grub on hd0 to boot both. That's a newbie friendly setup.
[05:02] <abes> Celldweller: ?
[05:02] <Celldweller> i said it... input and codecs
[05:02] <DevC> hold on I'll check and pastebin it through Winxp
[05:02] <kitsuneofdoom> I have a separate home partition. The /home partition appears as about 11G filled, but when I use filelight, it will only show about 6.5 GB. My personal folder appears as 9 GB.
[05:02] <paradizelost> soundray, or windows on hd1, ubuntu on hd0, and grub on hd0
[05:02] <kenThomson3> soundray: i have already messed windows once, i simply dont wish to touch that HDD
[05:02] <PlanarPlatypus|w> hi, does anyone know a way to find out the size of a given partition without using sudo?
[05:02] <poolkey172> fnf : error 17 : cannot mount selected partion
[05:02] <abes> Celldweller: Theora, x264, Fake
[05:02] <eimajenthat> soundray: maybe it's not forwarding the other machines dns requests properly for some reason, can't think why
[05:02] <nosbig> kenThomson3, Windows doe snot like having it's drive assignment changed from underneath it.
[05:03] <soundray> paradizelost: no, Windows on hd1 will have side effects that will drive him back here in no time.
[05:03] <dabaR> PlanarPlatypus|w: df -h
[05:03] <fnf> poolkey172: Do you see the menu ?
[05:03] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: Do you mean i set Ubuntu's drive as master, and the Windows one as slave, and then install Ubuntu?
[05:03] <poolkey172> yeh
[05:03] <poolkey172> fnf : yeh everything is here
[05:03] <soundray> eimajenthat: it's strange that it does it for some, but not others, though.
[05:03] <paradizelost> soundray, no, usually works fine for me
[05:03] <abes> Celldweller: Thats all that i have under that list
[05:03] <Celldweller> what's the path of your devices
[05:03] <sal> vigor: it is listed in the device manager, but I'm not sure how to set it as default? also it doesn't show up (properly) in gnome alsa mixer it just shows up as "usb mixer" with one mic port but it has more than that
[05:03] <PlanarPlatypus|w> dabaR, thanks
[05:03] <Rprp> dabaR: i just downloaded limewire. and did alien Limewire*
[05:03] <Rprp> But it created a .db file
[05:03] <Rprp> .dev*
[05:03] <nosbig> Install Windows on the first (master) drive, and Linux on the second one...  Otherwise, you'll have to play some interesting tricks with Grub...
[05:03] <kenThomson3> Does Ubuntu go in the master drive or the slave one?
[05:04] <abes> Celldweller: In VLC or in the system?
[05:04] <kenThomson3> I Dont wish to install GRUB on the windows HDD.
[05:04] <Celldweller> VLC
[05:04] <fnf> poolkey172: Will you post the two relevant lines (press 'e' on the target option): kernel, root and initrd
[05:04] <tonyyarusso> does naim let you set away messages?
[05:04] <kenThomson3> please tell me in some simple language
[05:04] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, why don't you want to install grub on the windows drive?
[05:04] <paradizelost> because it will work perfectly
[05:04] <eimajenthat> soundray, glad I'm not the only one who thinks so
[05:04] <abes> Celldweller: Hmmm... there is no path to DVD device....
[05:04] <poolkey172> fnf : I am looking at those already and they are fine
[05:04] <nosbig> kenThomson3, Ubuntu on slave; Windows on Master...  Use a boot disk, if you have to...
[05:04] <Celldweller> well there ya go
[05:04] <Celldweller> you are missing a device
[05:04] <abes> Celldweller: But there is one to VCD whic is the same as the DVD one should be
[05:04] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: becuase i already messed one Windows HDD, i simply wish to leave it alone
[05:05] <Celldweller> ok
[05:05] <poolkey172> fnf : kernel : /boot/vmlinuz......... root=/dev/hdb1 ro quiet etc perfect
[05:05] <chandu> cappicard, hiii
[05:05] <Celldweller> copy that same thing
[05:05] <soundray> kenThomson3: then find a guide for setting the Windows boot loader to boot Linux.
[05:05] <Celldweller> to the DVD path
[05:05] <kitsuneofdoom> I have a separate home partition. The /home partition appears as about 11G filled, but when I use filelight, it will only show about 6.5 GB. My personal folder appears as 9 GB. My personal folder is the bulk of the /home folder. There is discrepancy here
[05:05] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, then add a 3rd drive
[05:05] <Celldweller> save settings nd try that
[05:05] <dabaR> Rprp: Rprp get this file, and unpack it http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther

[05:05] <fnf> poolkey172: How about 'root' ?
[05:05] <poolkey172> fnf : initrd /boot/initd.img-2.6.17-10-generic
[05:05] <chandu> what should i do to play rm format
[05:05] <kenThomson3> nosbig: paradizelost: THat's what i had done, Windows as master, Ubuntu as slave, but as GRUB was present on Ubuntu's drive. So the machine simply booted Windows as if no Ubuntu was present.
[05:05] <nosbig> chandu, http://mplayerhq.hu
[05:05] <paradizelost> kitsuneofdoom, maybe one of your programs don't check .paths
[05:05] <Rprp> dabaR: I already have the .dev file of it.
[05:05] <dabaR> !realplayer > chandu
[05:05] <soundray> eimajenthat: sorry, I've no ideas for troubleshooting that problem...
[05:05] <poolkey172> fnf : root I am not sure about ! it says hd0,0
[05:05] <Rprp> But dont know how to make it ;?
[05:06] <poolkey172> fnf : root I am not sure about ! it says hd0,0 which I think is wrong
[05:06] <abes> Celldweller: well the disc started spinning and PLAY button on VLC turned into PAUSE, but there is no vid/aud output whatsoever
[05:06] <Celldweller> Hd0 is the windows partition if its dual boot
[05:06] <poolkey172> fnf : should it not be something like hd1,0 ?
[05:06] <fnf> poolkey172: If only mine has a floppy driver, sorry, give me a minute to find the possible cause for this.
[05:06] <kenThomson3> I am still confused! Can someone please sort all the advice, and tell it to me in utter simplicity?
[05:06] <eimajenthat> soundray: I was thinking of flashing it to dd-wrt for other reasons, seems like a decent chance that would fix this as well, no?
[05:06] <abes> Celldweller: What about "input repetitions" should i change that?
[05:06] <dabaR> Rprp: you mean install it. I know how, but I recommned the other way that I told you about.
[05:06] <soundray> Celldweller: hd0 is never a partition.
[05:07] <poolkey172> fnf : thanks
[05:07] <Celldweller> er hd1
[05:07] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, if you don't have grub on the MBR on the windows drive, when it's the first drive, it will NEVER see that ubuntu is there
[05:07] <eimajenthat> soundray: I know it's kind of a sledgehammer approach, but if it would work
[05:07] <Celldweller> go to stream output
[05:07] <Celldweller> inthe settings
[05:07] <Celldweller> in VLC
[05:07] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: I know that. and i am asking for a solution for such a situation!
[05:07] <dabaR> kenThomson3: when the computer boots, it looks for a boot loader in the master boot record of the first hard drive, the master. If one is found, any other bootloaders on other drives are ignored.
[05:07] <chandu> dabaR, iam new to linux
[05:08] <soundray> eimajenthat: if the problem is even in the router, yes. OTOH, flashing the firmware won't reset your nvram, and resetting nvram isn't recommended anyway...
[05:08] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, the solution is to have grub on the windows drive
[05:08] <abes> Celldweller: Ok... and?
[05:08] <sod75> kenThomson3: or to use a boot floppy
[05:08] <soundray> eimajenthat: I'm slightly partial to OpenWrt btw.
[05:08] <dabaR> kenThomson3: well, just fixgrubafterinstallingwindows.
[05:08] <chandu> what i need to do to paly this rm format in linux
[05:08] <dneary> Hi
[05:08] <Celldweller> click them all but the top one
[05:08] <dabaR> grub > kenThomson3
[05:08] <Celldweller> make sure they are all checked except the first one
[05:08] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: please please tell me any other solution, than putting grub on windows hdd
[05:08] <soundray> Celldweller: hd1 is never a partition either.
[05:08] <poolkey172> fnf : how do I see all the hd mappings in grub console
[05:08] <kenThomson3> sod75: You want me to use a floppy :(
[05:08] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, have a 3rd drive that u use to boot
[05:08] <rasputnik> is it normal not to be able to umount /var in  Edgy single user?
[05:09] <abes> Celldweller: The one under "File"? There is a lot of subcategories there
[05:09] <paradizelost> be it a floppy, hard drive, usb drive, etc...
[05:09] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: you mean a third HDD?
[05:09] <kenThomson3> ok
[05:09] <sod75> kenThomson3: then it's not on your hd0 :)
[05:09] <paradizelost> yes
[05:09] <dneary> I'm looking for some detailed docs on managing translations on rosetta - any idea where I can get some?
[05:09] <Celldweller> no

[05:09] <paradizelost> and it HAS to be the first drive

[05:09] <fnf> poolkey172: It's a bit off my knowledge, I haven't really played that much with GRUB.
[05:09] <eimajenthat> soundray, I looked at it, but it seemed the web interface was a separate component, and it wasn't too obvious (at least to me) how to get and install that component
[05:09] <dabaR> chandu: look at your private messages, and follow the guide in the first link.
[05:09] <paradizelost> eimajenthat, i use DD-WRT
[05:09] <M3G4crux> hi
[05:09] <sal> can anyone help me get my US122 USB audio/midi interface working?
[05:09] <abes> Celldweller: Then "Stream output" and check stuff under "Access output"???
[05:10] <kenThomson3> How about this: I put a blank drive as master, and windows one as slave. I boot from the liveCD, and install ubuntu on the blank HDD. Than i install GRUB ON ubuntu's HDD. On rebooting will everything work?
=== desaparecido is now known as desaparecidoo
[05:10] <soundray> eimajenthat: not any more, if you get white russian rc6 or so, the web interface comes with it.
[05:10] <M3G4crux> has anyone experienced problems with fonts, character encodings, etc after upgrading to Edgy
[05:10] <Celldweller> yes
[05:10] <poolkey172> Anyone know if I can make a lilo boot floopy instead then ?
[05:10] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, the windows drive won't like that setup
[05:10] <sod75> kenThomson3: not sure windows will like being moved
[05:10] <Celldweller> it knows your dvd rom/cd drive is there... it's a configuration problem or a configure problem
[05:11] <soundray> M3G4crux: yes. Font problems went away with a fresh install, character encoding is a new problem that came with the fresh install and I haven't solved it yet.
[05:11] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: sod75: than please suggest what should i do, if i dont want GRUB on the MBR of windows HDD.
[05:11] <Daviey> Has anybody here tried fiesty out?
[05:11] <dabaR> Daviey: ask on #ubuntu+1
[05:11] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, the easiest way, 2 drives, install windows on first drive, then load ubuntu on the 2nd drive, and let it do it's autmatic thing
[05:11] <rasputnik> kenThomson3: I'd try that - its' easily reversible and it might well work
[05:11] <soundray> kenThomson3: you are making your life exceedingly difficult because of an irrational fear of messing something up.
[05:12] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, i agree with soundray
[05:12] <poolkey172> kenthomson3 have u read the linunx , winnt boot loader howto ? u can do it that was
[05:12] <Daviey> dabaR, i'm gonna guess *everybody* in there has tried it out! ;)
[05:12] <poolkey172> kenthomson3 have u read the linunx , winnt boot loader howto ? u can do it that way
[05:12] <paradizelost> i've done the dualboot setup literally hundreds of times
[05:12] <rasputnik> why does Edgy not let me umount /var in single user?
[05:12] <Celldweller> just make sure that everything is set to default.. for names
[05:12] <dm__> Important question for yall, Is there anyway for the system to automatically restart a daemon if it closes?
[05:12] <Vigor> sal: Did you run the lspci -n ?
[05:12] <Celldweller> like the output module
[05:12] <kenThomson3> poolkey172: link please?
[05:12] <paradizelost> poolkey172, *SHUDDER*
[05:12] <Celldweller> then try it and let meknow
[05:12] <paradizelost> you really want him messing with dd?\
[05:12] <poolkey172> paradizelost : why ? its quick n easy
[05:13] <Celldweller> dont use up yourdvd's up lol
[05:13] <rasputnik> dm__: yes, you can respawn it from /etc/inittab
[05:13] <kenThomson3> paradizelost: soundray: I am asking for solution which DONT involve touching windows MBR
[05:13] <kenThomson3> BECUASE one i already messed the whole thing
[05:13] <soundray> kenThomson3: yep, that's your irrational fear.
[05:13] <dm__> rasputnik so lets say it crashes, with the sytem start it up again
[05:13] <Celldweller> there probably isnt an ption for that kenThompson3
[05:13] <kenThomson3> it may be, but that has got to be a workaround
[05:13] <paradizelost> kenThomson3, if by messing it up by moving drives around, don't do that
[05:13] <rasputnik> dm__: yes, that's what respawn means.
[05:14] <dm__> rasputnik is that a txt file?
[05:14] <rasputnik> dm__: yes
[05:14] <soundray> kenThomson3: any workaround is more difficult and more likely to result in further messups than just overcoming that fear.

[05:27] <Celldweller> go toanother mirror
[05:28] <Celldweller> not you M3G4crux
[05:28] <apokryphos> great... at the end :/
[05:28] <Celldweller> lol
[05:28] <nosbig> Celldweller, are you using a hardwaer RAID controller or trying to use the software RAID?
[05:28] <M3G4crux> ok Celldweller thanks for letting me stay here :o
[05:28] <M3G4crux> ;)
[05:28] <ScreaminIke> i have a Belking 802.11g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000). though the wiki says it works "out of the box"... it doesn't. i've installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome, but certain features seem totally unaccessable, including scanning for networks, and connecting to even unencrypted networks. can i get some help?

[05:28] <dmnd> Joakim: try a mirror or something?
[05:28] <Celldweller> i have no control over if u stay here or not
[05:29] <Joakim> i know that
[05:29] <Celldweller> and i was useing software raid
[05:29] <M3G4crux> you never know, I might only real in your mind
[05:29] <Celldweller> from Bios
[05:29] <Joakim> used pastebin alotta times
[05:29] <soundray> M3G4crux: for the font problem, create a new user and see if it occurs with that.
[05:29] <M3G4crux> ok soundray
[05:29] <M3G4crux> I check that straight away
[05:29] <nosbig> From BIOS....  OK  Hardware RAID on the motherboard...
[05:29] <Celldweller> ok yea
[05:29] <Morrissey> What is v4l? In xorg module? Video for linux? when should I enable that?
[05:30] <Celldweller> technically lol
[05:30] <Celldweller> but yes
[05:30] <nosbig> Once you create your array in the BIOS configuration, Ubuntu (or any Linux distro, for that matter) should see the drives as a single unit...
[05:30] <poolkey172> morrossey : video for linux
[05:30] <soundray> poolkey172: sorry, I don't know enough about RAID to effectively help you booting from one...
[05:30] <M3G4crux> in fact you might be the only one reading me, I think you are not even awake
[05:30] <dm__> rasputnik lol they always have to put the documentation in terms i cant understand ( because im not an expert or advanced linux user )
[05:30] <poolkey172> soundray : nice try I aint letting u escape just yet
[05:30] <Celldweller> soundray,  its ok.. i dont need ro Raid them... i just wanted to  play around with it
[05:30] <poolkey172> soundray : lol dont worry about it :)
[05:30] <nosbig> You can host the boot as part of the array, in this case.
[05:31] <nosbig> If you wish to use Linux's software RAID, you will have to put a boot partition on another drive...
[05:31] <Joakim> i can use the standard repositories
[05:31] <Celldweller> I was just seeing if it would work on RAID 5
[05:32] <nosbig> And no matter what you do with RAID, I highly recommend using Logical Volumes...
[05:32] <poolkey172> soundray : thanks for trying anyway : I am going and disabling raid in the BIOS and going for a fresh install and try to install grub on the boot record for the standalone disk on the IDE port
[05:32] <dcordes>  send #75
[05:32] <Celldweller> it apparently does when its configured right
[05:32] <nosbig> Celldweller, sure it will...
[05:32] <Celldweller> MCN live worked when i finished the install
[05:32] <dcordes> oh sorry i was about to leech some file on another channel d'oh
[05:32] <Celldweller> but that was quickly riped back off... dont like it
[05:33] <Celldweller> i had high expectations of Fedora 6, but that gave me nothing but problems
[05:33] <poolkey172> nosbig : I got my pseudo software RAID recognised with the /dev/mapper and it's giving me 95Meg a second thats something I dont want to let up..... PS Do you know a good ubuntu software RAID howto ?
[05:33] <Joakim> YAY :D
[05:33] <Celldweller> poolkey172,  when you get done... be sure to post everything you do in a forum lol

[05:35] <nosbig> poolkey172, what trouble are you having?  If you have it recognized, you are probably in good shape...
[05:35] <Celldweller> thats the only german phrase i know
[05:36] <DevC> dabaR: went back and checked a few things...for some reason they all went back to hoary instead of breezy which is why it is ignoring the upgrades.....I'll edit them accordingly
[05:36] <nosbig> I use Grip.
[05:36] <poolkey172> nosbig : I just want to make sure
[05:36] <soundray> Celldweller: find the person who told you that was German and give her a good smack.
[05:36] <reus> my amarok says no alsa no dcopserver

=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as mikm
[05:41] <Celldweller> i dont really know
[05:41] <DevC> what do I change the CD binary to for breezy?
[05:41] <Celldweller> not my area
[05:41] <reus> :$
[05:41] <Jeej> can anyone help me with updating ubuntu from warty to edgy?
[05:41] <reus> it started with installin vmware server
[05:41] <jbroome> !update
[05:41] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:41] <reus> witch still dont work
[05:41] <defrysk> Jeej, thats virtually impossible
[05:41] <soundray> DevC: the CD binary? Not clear what you mean.
[05:42] <Celldweller> path to the server is correct?
[05:42] <soundray> Jeej: sure. Backup your data files and do a fresh install from an edgy desktop CD.
[05:42] <Celldweller> im confused.. i think i had better sit this one out
[05:42] <Jeej> Why cann't i just update?
[05:42] <Celldweller> too far back i believe Jeej
[05:42] <soundray> Jeej: because there were three releases since warty.
[05:43] <Celldweller> lol
[05:43] <DevC> in the repositories the top option says CD 5.04 Hoary and I need to change it to 5.10 for updates
[05:43] <Jeej> so it isn't supported any more?
[05:43] <defrysk> Jeej, make a backup and do a fresh install is my advise
[05:43] <soundray> DevC: aren't you doing your upgrade via the internet?
[05:43] <Celldweller> DevC
[05:43] <AsheD> are there any linux mp3 taggers that support ALL of the different id3v2 modes?
[05:43] <Celldweller> yea
[05:43] <soundray> Jeej: no, not really
[05:43] <Celldweller> nm soundray can multitask
[05:43] <defrysk> !backup > Jeej
[05:43] <Celldweller> im not sain nuffin lol
[05:44] <reus> nuffin!
[05:44] <Jeej> ok, that's not nice :( but i will download and install edgy
[05:44] <Celldweller> lol
[05:44] <defrysk> Jeej, to many releases inbeteween to make it doable sorry :(
[05:44] <DevC> yeah but it still looks at the CD repository according to it cause if you change it to a wrong one it pops up saying it can't find the repository
[05:44] <poolkey172> Going down for YET another ubuntu install :o
[05:44] <Celldweller> Jeej you'll like it betteer anyways
[05:45] <Celldweller> you're like in win3.1  in comparison
[05:45] <soundray> Jeej: you'll be impressed at the strides ubuntu has made...
[05:45] <defrysk> Celldweller, bad compare :p
[05:45] <Rprp> Hi, i just installed LimeWirwe, but if i click on the limewire icon its not starting, how can i fix thisa?
[05:45] <Celldweller> defrysk lol yea i know... kinda caught that a lil too late
[05:45] <Jeej> thank you for your help
[05:45] <kmaynard> warty...wow
[05:45] <vintendo> jaava
[05:45] <poolkey172> cellweller : wishful thinking ; ubuntu is good but not that good
[05:46] <defrysk> lol poolkey172
[05:46] <Celldweller> i like it
[05:46] <Celldweller> but its not my favorite
[05:46] <poolkey172> cellweller : what do u prefer ?
[05:46] <vintendo> Rprp: install frost fire and java
[05:46] <Vimmel> Anyone know how I can mount a windows share? sudo mount -t smbfs //server/path /media/path -o rw,username=username,password=password is not working
[05:46] <Celldweller> i prefer openSuse
[05:46] <Rprp> frost fire?apt-get install ?
[05:46] <defrysk> !java > Rprp
[05:46] <Celldweller> or Mandriva
[05:46] <poolkey172> Vimmel use cifs instead
[05:47] <defrysk> !info frostwire > Rprp
[05:47] <ubotu> Package frostwire does not exist in any distro I know
[05:47] <defrysk> ouch
[05:47] <poolkey172> cellweller : pakage wise does it have more updates than this ?
[05:47] <drakeoutlaw> Eons: its drake here. Want to thank you again for getting bluetooth working. Is just about perfect now
[05:47] <Celldweller> OpenSuse did yes
[05:47] <Celldweller> Mandriva... a litle lower than ubuntu
[05:48] <drakeoutlaw> frostwire is best installed with automatix
[05:48] <poolkey172> Vimmel here u go
[05:48] <defrysk> !automatix > drakeoutlaw
[05:48] <Rprp> Oke,,
[05:48] <soundray> DevC: just comment out the CD repo in the sources.list

[05:49] <ubotu> dcordes: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:49] <DevC> soundray: or can I just tell the synaptic to remove it since I am doing it over the net (which is how I always do it)
[05:49] <dcordes> soundray: thx
[05:49] <soundray> dcordes: sorry for the correction
[05:49] <Celldweller> i wanna see that error, i think it was the same one i had when BeliniX was installed
[05:49] <apokryphos> Rprp: ok, no problem. Just for the future :)

[05:50] <soundray> DevC: yes, you can
[05:50] <defrysk> The_Dark_Side_Of, rightclick clock in your panel and change prefs
[05:50] <bam_> Hi I was wondering if anyone could tell me why my USB devices stopped automounting after the last Ubuntu update?
[05:50] <Rainarrow> Hi everyone, I have a question about wget here
[05:50] <sebas__> Hi, is there any firewall in the edgy server version? i can't access mysql from other machines
[05:50] <soundray> bam_: that's hard to tell. Do you want the fix though?
[05:50] <The_Dark_Side_Of> defrysk, it does not have the option to use the local. just UTC.
[05:51] <DevC> soundray: ok CD has been removed and everything else now points to breezy so hopefully the upgrades will go off with out a problem from now on
[05:51] <bam_> yes ofcourse!
[05:51] <M3G4crux> soundray, your messaged included this: x11r5_create_fontset?
[05:51] <Rainarrow> if I open a terminal, wget something, and then want to wget another file, do I have to open another terminal?
[05:51] <soundray> DevC: breezy? Make everything point to dapper.
[05:51] <Celldweller> soundray i need that fix too lol
[05:51] <soundray> M3G4crux: no
[05:51] <DevC> dapper say to make sure breezy is completely updated before going to dapper
[05:51] <flummoxd> Rainarrow: if your first wget is still going, then "yes"
[05:51] <M3G4crux> ok, I only see like chinese and russian links to this problem
[05:52] <flummoxd> Rainarrow: you could do wget http://foo &
[05:52] <soundray> bam_, Celldweller: System-Preferences-Removable Drives and Media
[05:52] <M3G4crux> I have tried other user with no success
[05:52] <flummoxd> Rainarrow: the & puts it in the background
[05:52] <trappist> Rainarrow: if I'm wgetting something big, I like to do it in a screen session
[05:52] <flummoxd> yes, screen is the best solution
[05:52] <Rainarrow> flummoxd, thanks for the & thing
[05:52] <Rainarrow> flummoxd, I don
[05:52] <bam_> anything I can do from KDE(dont have GNOME)...
[05:52] <Rainarrow> flummoxd, I don't know you could use & with a CLI application
[05:52] <Celldweller> yea but it was the belkin v1
[05:52] <DevC> soundray: dapper says to make sure everything is updated for breezy before going to dapper and upon going to breezy I got more updates that I have to do first
[05:52] <soundray> DevC: okay, that makes sense. Install ubuntu-desktop if you don't have it.
[05:52] <Rainarrow> flummoxd, hoho
[05:52] <Celldweller> i couldnt find a driver for it
[05:52] <bam_> maybe from "Control Center" ?
[05:53] <trappist> flummoxd: in my experience & isn't so great with wget because it keeps trying to draw the progress indicator
[05:53] <DevC> soundray: ok
[05:53] <Celldweller> even belkin didnt release one
[05:53] <flummoxd> ah
[05:53] <Rainarrow> flummoxd, so if it's in the background, the only way to terminate it would be using kill?
[05:53] <flummoxd> can't say I've actually tried this
[05:53] <Vimmel> poolkey172: Worked all thx to you... =)
[05:53] <flummoxd> yes
[05:53] <Celldweller> then i heard it was a zydas prism chipset... so i started looking for those drivers
[05:53] <trappist> Rainarrow: you can foreground a backgrounded process by saying 'fg'
[05:53] <defrysk> The_Dark_Side_Of, maybe this helps : ttp://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper_nl#How_to_disable_system_time.2Fdate_from_being_reset_to_UTC_.28GMT.29

[05:54] <Celldweller> came  in handy for my integrated wifi chip
[05:54] <poolkey172> Vimmel : Thanks mate
[05:54] <Rainarrow> trappist, I've tried the & thing, as you said it doesn't work
[05:54] <Celldweller> but the USB thing... i have some troubles with some things
[05:54] <Rainarrow> trappist, due to the progress bar
[05:54] <defrysk> The_Dark_Side_Of, should be  : http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper_nl#How_to_disable_system_time.2Fdate_from_being_reset_to_UTC_.28GMT.29
[05:54] <cuteAndFluffy> Do we have anyone here who is good at installing Ubuntu on a Mac?
[05:54] <DevC> I'll be back on if I hit any problems after this
[05:54] <M3G4crux> I dont know whether do download 115mb of additional xfonts or not, ... :) to solve the problem
[05:54] <soundray> trappist: how about wget -nv ?
[05:54] <The_Dark_Side_Of> defrysk, i am going to check it..
[05:54] <mc__> !anyone > cuteAndFluffy
[05:54] <trappist> soundray: yeah that oughtta work
[05:54] <Thokalin> having fried my motherboard, what will happen to my ubuntu installation? will it still work, or do i need to reinstall after that?
[05:55] <Celldweller> M3G4crux,  u can get rid of them later
[05:55] <Rainarrow> trappist, but if I close that terminal while wget is still running, it will continue in the background
[05:55] <LadyNikon> Thokalin: are you going to a new motherboard?
[05:55] <soundray> Thokalin: if the replacement isn't too dissimilar, and if you're keeping the graphics card, it should be okay.
[05:55] <Thokalin> yes that's the only thing that's going to be changing
[05:55] <Rainarrow> trappist, but then if I say fg, it tell me no such job
[05:55] <LadyNikon> Thokalin: you should be fine then.  just have to redo a few things
[05:56] <Thokalin> that's a relief..
[05:56] <M3G4crux> well Celldweller I wouldnt know which ones I have installed
[05:56] <LadyNikon> Thokalin: hopefully you dont go throught the crap i went through when i fried my mobo
[05:56] <cuteAndFluffy> Ok then, how do I create the AppleBootstrap-partition that's needed?
[05:56] <LadyNikon> my card died 4 mntha after
[05:56] <bam_> soundray: What was that fix again?
[05:56] <Rprp> Can someone help me? whats wrong with this: http://rafb.net/paste/results/WF8isx63.html and how can i fix it?
[05:56] <Thokalin> LadyNikon: what was that?

[05:57] <Rprp> I tried already with normal user
[05:57] <Rprp> but still the same error.
[05:57] <Joakim> when i didn't have beryl, i could run 800x600 in resolution
[05:57] <Rainarrow> trappist, and in the STAT column it says "R"
[05:58] <trappist> Rainarrow: this is with -nv and &, or in screen?
[05:58] <Rprp> ricky@ricky-desktop:~$ fglrxinfo
[05:58] <Rprp> Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
[05:58] <Joakim> 1024x786* sorry
[05:58] <cuteAndFluffy> No-one that has a clue?
[05:58] <Joakim> and after the beryl installation, i can only use 800x600
[05:58] <Joakim> that's annoying
[05:58] <Rainarrow> trappist, I did the following: open a terminal, wget something, and close that terminal, then open another terminal
[05:58] <aiesec> how do i install beryl
[05:59] <Joakim> i want it 1024x786
[05:59] <Celldweller> brb

[05:59] <Rainarrow> trappist, and if I run fg in the latter terminal it says "no such job"
[05:59] <dbe> How can I fix this?: Errors were encountered while processing: postgresql-common postgresql-8.1 E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[05:59] <Joakim> can somebody help me?
[05:59] <Rainarrow> trappist, if I run ps -x, I can see wget is still running
[05:59] <Joakim> please
[05:59] <trappist> Rainarrow: oh no, don't do that.  if you want to be able to close the terminal, say 'nohup wget [options] 
[05:59] <trappist> Rainarrow: or use screen
[05:59] <soundray> dbe: post the output of 'sudo apt-get -f install' on the pastebin
[06:00] <dabaR> cuteAndFluffy: you can do it with the installation of the osx cd, that is how I did it. Are you going to reinstall os x or are you keeping the current installation?
[06:00] <Joakim> somebody: please
[06:00] <Joakim> i need help

[06:00] <talv> hi all, i wonder if anyone can help me, ive just set ubuntu up on my friends laptop and its now part of our network which ahs windows and ubuntu nachines conencted too it, when people stream vidoes from my pc in windows they have no problems but when then try and stream from ubuntu machiones they cant, they have to copy the file over and then watch it
[06:00] <runes> what is the proper way of mounting an ide drive in ubuntu?
[06:00] <Rainarrow> trappist, why can't I man fg?
[06:00] <web-on> hi
[06:00] <dabaR> runes: the command is mount
[06:00] <soundray> Rainarrow: because it
[06:01] <web-on> Hey
[06:01] <soundray> Rainarrow: because it's a shell builtin
[06:01] <runes> dabaR, for a permanent mount in fstab
[06:01] <Rainarrow> soundray, but isn't ls also a shell builtin?
[06:01] <trappist> Rainarrow: it's not a command, it's a bash builtin.  man bash and search for fg.
[06:01] <trappist> Rainarrow: nope
[06:01] <Joakim> i run AIGLX/Beryl
[06:01] <soundray> Rainarrow: it is both a builtin and a standalone program.
[06:01] <benny99> hello, my standard alsa device changes sometimes... it should be hw:0,0 , but sometimes it's hw:2,0 , after a reboot it's hw:0,0 again
[06:01] <dabaR> runes: well, run sudo fdisk -l, see the type and device node, create a mount point, and make an entry with all that info in fstab
[06:01] <benny99> any ideas ?
[06:01] <Rainarrow> soundray, trappist ok I see, thank you
[06:01] <web-on> I got an error when I try to save any document in "bluefish", someone knows why???????????????
[06:02] <dbe> soundray, http://rafb.net/paste/results/X8BuRJ82.html
[06:02] <Joakim> someone?
[06:02] <minimec|afk> Joakim: 1st. What is the default resoluton in the /etc/xorg.con file? What card do you have? How many RAM on your card?
[06:02] <Joakim> 1024 mb ram
[06:02] <benny99> your VRAM
[06:02] <poolkey172> YES BABY : UBBUNTU IS LOADING WHOOOOoooooooooo HOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo
[06:02] <Joakim> I have 1024x768
[06:02] <poolkey172> laters
[06:02] <minimec|afk> Joakim: On the graphics card, not on the computer.
[06:02] <M3G4crux> my xorg.conf didnt have FontPath specified for /usr/share/fonts/X11/encodings
[06:02] <dbe> soundray, I did sudo apt-get update and have all packages updated as well.
[06:02] <benny99> hello, my standard alsa device changes sometimes... it should be hw:0,0 , but sometimes it's hw:2,0 , after a reboot it's hw:0,0 again (sorry for double-posting)
[06:02] <Joakim> yeah
[06:03] <runes> dabaR, I did mount the drive /dev/hdb1 in fstab  but I tried to create a symbolic link in users folders so that they could ftp into it..if the user logs on locally they see the link and are able to access the files if they ftp (vsftpd) it won't allow them to see
[06:03] <Joakim> gimme a commando to check that
[06:03] <trappist> soundray: ls doesn't seem to be a bash builtin at all
[06:03] <Joakim> grep, or something
[06:03] <M3G4crux> when running xorg not xorg-air nor Xgl it is not necessary to have option aiglx true to run beryl right?
[06:03] <Celldweller> soundray i hope that u r getting paid for this
[06:03] <Celldweller> lol
[06:03] <minimec|afk> Joakim: are you talking to me?
[06:03] <grunger> Ahh, anybody in here uses eciadsl drivers?
[06:03] <Joakim> yeah
[06:03] <Celldweller> or open a paypal donation acccount
[06:03] <Joakim> i need to check it
[06:04] <Joakim> i have nvidia 6800 gt
[06:04] <dbe> soundray, Any idea whats happening?
[06:04] <web-on> Someone use bluefish???????????????????????????????????''
[06:04] <dabaR> runes: did you try cding to the mount point in ftp?
[06:04] <M3G4crux> cool I have nvidia quadro FX2500 :p
[06:04] <dbe> web-on, I did, I use Emacs now.
[06:04] <Joakim> emacs rules
[06:04] <runes> dabaR, yes no go no listing
[06:04] <web-on> dbe: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[06:04] <dbe> Joakim, Nvidia sucks.
[06:05] <dbe> Joakim, Go ATI instead, that supports free drivers.
[06:05] <dabaR> runes: and you have the right permissions on the mount point after it is mounted? ls -l will show you permissions
[06:05] <runes> dabaR, I do see the link though just nothing inside it I also even chmod 777
[06:05] <soundray> dbe: can you run 'sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common' and pastebin the output, if any
[06:05] <runes> dabaR, 777 as well just to be sure
[06:05] <grunger> Fuck Ubuntu, I'm moving to Suse! /j #suse
[06:05] <dbe> soundray, Sure.
[06:05] <benny99> good bye
[06:05] <Joakim> whatever, too much effort to change gpu
[06:05] <minimec|afk> Joakim: So please write minimec at the beginning of your phrase. Otherwise I may not notice you ;) Open /etc/xorg.conf in a Terminal and go to the line where you got something like that * 24  "1024x768" "800x600" ...
[06:05] <benny99> grunger: it won't help you much...
[06:05] <Winand> I was clicking on some stuff
[06:06] <dbe> soundray, sudo: /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common: command not found
[06:06] <Winand> and my ubuntu mouse froze, I mean I can move it still but I can't click
[06:06] <martibs> can anyone help me with my webcam problem? some sources claim that the firmware  is the same as those used by the spca5xx driver, but the vendor_id and product_id does not appear on the "supported cameras" list, nor does the machine recognize the camera when I plug it in, with the gspca driver...
[06:06] <Winand> the cursor just stays like in a closed fist
[06:06] <Celldweller> winand
[06:06] <minimec|afk> Joakim: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:06] <Celldweller> you've rebooted right
[06:06] <Celldweller> just to make sure
[06:06] <soundray> dbe: my mistake
[06:06] <Winand> Celldweller: no
[06:06] <soundray> dbe: can you run 'sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.postinst' and pastebin the output, if any
[06:06] <Celldweller> try that
[06:06] <Winand> I don't want to reboot just to have my mouse working
[06:07] <Celldweller> well
[06:07] <Celldweller> it sees your mouse
[06:07] <dbe> soundray, No output.
[06:07] <Joakim> minimec: yeah?
[06:07] <Celldweller> obviously something happened when it was probing for it
[06:07] <dbe> soundray, But the file exist =).
[06:07] <DreamThief> any op in here?
[06:07] <soundray> dbe: now repeat the apt-get -f install pls
[06:07] <dabaR> DreamThief: for what?
[06:07] <aiesec> can anyone help me install xgl on ubuntu edgy eft?
[06:07] <Winand> Celldweller: I've used my mouse with  ubuntu for like 2 days
[06:07] <Celldweller> just try it unless u are doing something important
[06:07] <Rorviker> When I try boot from the Ubuntu Desktop 6.10 cd I get "Buffer i/o error on hdb", I believe hdb is the cd drive. I have redownloaded and burnt a new copy twice but no luck. My cd/dvd drive is pretty new and have no other problems.. Any options I can use to get pass this problem?
[06:08] <dabaR> !xgl > aiesec
[06:08] <Winand> then I clicked somewhere
[06:08] <Celldweller> get an updated mouse driver
[06:08] <aiesec> join xgl
[06:08] <Winand> and now the mouse thinks i'm moving an icon or something
[06:08] <aiesec> join /xgl
[06:08] <Celldweller> just reinstall the mouse driver
[06:08] <minimec|afk> Joakim: So you got that line? What's exactly written there?
[06:08] <Winand> how do you do that celldweller
[06:08] <DreamThief> for banning _emmanuelle . that's a spam-bot sending ads for a sex-related site to your query when joining the channel ;)
[06:08] <dbe> soundray, Same output.
[06:09] <BeetleMX5> Hello #ubuntu
[06:09] <Celldweller> oh hell...   i dont know off the top of my head... i've been up for a LOOOOONG time
[06:09] <edarague> Hi!
[06:09] <Celldweller> soundray can probably give u the command
[06:09] <Joakim> minimec: Modes      "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
[06:09] <Winand> Celldweller if I do ctrl+backspace+alt will that reset X?
[06:09] <Winand> and thus my mouse?
[06:09] <dbe> soundray, postgresql-7.1 says the same thing.
[06:09] <Celldweller> possibly
[06:09] <slapshot> hi everybody our LUG is creating a developers distro ubuntu based with all the tools and developing languages usefuls to programmers
[06:09] <Winand> ok let me try
[06:10] <pitti> dbe: I'm the postgresql maintainer, but I didn't follow the conversation; what's the problem
[06:10] <slapshot> we'd like to name it DevUbuntu
[06:10] <Celldweller> see you're solving your own problems.. even simpler
[06:10] <BeetleMX5> I have a question regarding ubuntu and KDE
[06:10] <slapshot> someone can tel me how I have to call to have this official name?
[06:10] <minimec|afk> Joakim: Now have a look at DefaultDepth (some lines before). That should be '24'.
[06:10] <Celldweller> lol go ahead BeetleMX5
[06:10] <Joakim> minimec: Depth       24
[06:11] <BeetleMX5> I would like to install KDE on my working ubuntu setup
[06:11] <apokryphos> hm
[06:11] <apokryphos> DreamThief: can you /msg me what it said?
[06:11] <Joakim> I have many sub-sections
[06:11] <DreamThief> wait
[06:11] <edarague> any one know how extract one string after a specific string... eg. I've abcxyc, but need string afer x. Then the output is xyz... ? in Commands bash
[06:11] <dbe> pitti, I cant install PostgreSQL 7.4 or 8.1 via apt in gNewSense 1.0 (build on Ubuntu Dapper), I get: http://rafb.net/paste/results/X8BuRJ82.html
[06:11] <soundray> dbe: for some reason, that postinst script returns an error, which isn't specified further. Do you know a bit about shell scripts and can find out what the problem is? If not, pastebin it and I'll have a look.
[06:12] <minimec|afk> Joakim: Depth 24 is ok. But there has to be another one at the beginning of the "screen" Section called DefaultDepth. That must be 24 too.
[06:12] <Celldweller> brb gonna go smokey
[06:12] <apokryphos> dabaR: worth checking if there's any active ops first sometimes :P
[06:12] <pitti> dbe: I bet I know what's wrong
[06:12] <dbe> soundray, I know how to handle scripts, what do you want me to look at?
[06:12] <BeetleMX5> Will i run into trouble if i just install teh KDE metapackage?
[06:12] <pitti> dbe: what does dpkg -s postgresql say? is it still installed or half-installed?
[06:12] <apokryphos> BeetleMX5: nope, see the installingKDE page
[06:12] <apokryphos> (wiki page, that is)
[06:12] <aiesec> where can i get the drivers for the builtin intel graphics chipset and how can i find out what model it is exactly
[06:12] <apokryphos> BeetleMX5: covered in the kubuntu.org FAQ
=== ibuchan is now known as buchan
[06:12] <runes> has anyone here ever created symlinks to work in an ftp server?
[06:13] <soundray> dbe: what /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.postinst might be doing that sets the exit status >0
[06:13] <apokryphos> DreamThief: have you sent it? I won't get any /msg from you if you're not registered btw.
[06:13] <dbe> pitti, http://rafb.net/paste/results/Z8rRYZ54.html
[06:13] <Joakim> minimec|afk i have started a private conversation with you
[06:14] <soundray> runes: I believe ftp servers ignore symlinks for security reasons
[06:14] <pitti> dbe: no, that's postgresql-8.1; I need 'postgresql'
[06:14] <minimec|afk> Joakim: One moment.
[06:14] <runes> soundray, then how does one allow users access to folders outside their home directory (in my case /media/ftp (mouted /dev/hdb1 to it)
[06:14] <dbe> pitti, http://rafb.net/paste/results/P32rVQ76.html

[06:16] <Amaranth> baastrup: Bug in the nvidia driver, we can't do anything.
[06:16] <soundray> runes: by mounting it to /home/ftpuser/ftpdir
[06:16] <apokryphos> kevinG: lspci
[06:16] <pitti> dbe: 'sudo sh -ex /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.postinst configure' output?
[06:16] <minimec> Joakim: Did you find that DefaultDepth?
[06:16] <baastrup> Amaranth: so im not the only one with this problem?
[06:16] <to1> visualstation : on parle anglais ici
[06:16] <aiesec> how do i check to see what graphics chipset i have?
[06:16] <Amaranth> baastrup: Others have had it, yes
[06:16] <runes> ok soundray  time for a test brb
[06:17] <baastrup> Amaranth: but with the drivers in edgy, and even the newest drivers from nvidia?

[06:17] <Luke> Amaranth: when will your server be back up?
[06:17] <runes> wait soundray umm how would I be able to mount it for each user?  I wanted to have a link in /etc/skel so that each time I crete a user they have access to the mount in their home directory
[06:17] <noldon> !/dev/dsp
[06:17] <kevinG> I've been trying to get Beryl to work...but it seems that the Beryl site is down
[06:18] <Luke> Amaranth: er... back online

[06:18] <visualstation> tol dsl je me suis trompe de chan :)
[06:18] <soundray> runes: symlinks seem to be the way forward... Have you checked your ftpd config to see whether you can enable symlinks?
[06:18] <Rorviker> When I try boot from the Ubuntu Desktop 6.10 cd I get "Buffer i/o error on hdb", I believe hdb is the cd drive. I have redownloaded and burnt a new copy twice but no luck. My cd/dvd drive is pretty new and have no other problems.. Any options I can use to get pass this problem?
[06:19] <minimec> Joakim: I am having a cigarette. brb
[06:19] <dbe> pitti, So I'm stucked, and thats it? gah.
[06:19] <visualstation> tol my reply was for gentoofr chan :$
[06:19] <runes> soundray, I did not see any info on it in the vsftpd.conf
[06:19] <Joakim> ok
[06:19] <soundray> Rorviker: do you have a HD on /dev/hda ?
[06:19] <Rorviker> soundray: I have 3 harddrives connected
[06:19] <pitti> dbe: give me some time, I'm just eyeballing the stuff; are you on Kubuntu?
[06:20] <Rorviker> soundray: I have tried to disconnect them one by one, and even though I dont have a harddrive connected it gives the same error.. Thats why I believe its the cd/dvd drive that makes the error
[06:20] <dbe> pitti, I'm on gNewSense (build on Ubuntu Dapper GNU/Linux, approved by FSF)
[06:20] <dbe> pitti, So its problaby a broken package from their repositories
[06:21] <soundray> runes: have you got a deny_file entry?
[06:21] <apokryphos> dbe: I haven't followed the discussion, so I haven't followed if it's relevant, but #gnewsense is good
[06:21] <pitti> dbe: if you purge all postgresql-related packages and install them from scratch, and you get this, then I have never seen this before
[06:21] <dbe> apecat, Im there.
[06:21] <soundray> Rorviker: have you checked the master/slave jumper settings?
[06:21] <runes> soundray, messed up the filesystem reinstalling (don't ask) will be up in about 15 mins
[06:21] <pitti> dbe: dbe can you please get me 'DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer sudo sh -ex /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.config configure' ?
[06:21] <dbe> pitti, sudo apt-get remove-purge postg...?
[06:22] <pitti> dbe: let's poke this a little, if you have time
[06:22] <soundray> pitti: s/config/postinst/ ?
[06:22] <pitti> soundray: config should be fine
[06:22] <Rorviker> soundray: Would that have any to do with the cd stopping to boot when I got the Ubuntu logo? All og the drives works 100% under Windows
[06:23] <dbe> pitti, I got all the time in the world to get through with this if you have =).

[06:24] <Rorviker> soundray: The jumper settings is fine.. But it could be a "old" ide cable.. Have a bunc of them
[06:24] <dbe> pitti, Yes.
[06:24] <Rorviker> I'll try to replace it with a new one

[06:26] <mborohov> shripani: with? and can i do it later? im running off to class
[06:26] <apokryphos> slapshot: there's a lot of info on there about Loco teams. It should also link to Canonical's specifications when using the Ubuntu name
[06:26] <dabaR> catOS: did you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation?
[06:26] <apokryphos> slapshot: (as it's trademarked)

[06:26] <Rorviker> soundray: I hope that its only that.. cause I can install the server, and I can install slackware and the drive works fine with everything so I thought it was odd that it only fucks up on ubuntu

[06:27] <mborohov> shripani: it's not as big a deal as you think :) but sure, i can talk to you about it later today
[06:27] <Rorviker> sorry :p
[06:27] <GionnyBoss> thanks soundray I will check that webpage
[06:27] <DevC> soundray: got everything upgraded to 5.10 but when I change it to dapper the repositories act like they don't know where they are
[06:27] <shriphani> thx mborohov
[06:28] <pitti> dbe: ok, let's hit it over the head some more
[06:28] <pitti> dbe: sudo sed -i 's/sh -e/sh -ex/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.config
[06:28] <slapshot> apokryphos: thank you I will look there
[06:28] <pitti> dbe: and then
[06:28] <pitti> dbe: sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.config configure
[06:28] <slapshot> for the ones interested we are searching for suggestions on what include inside this developers distro
[06:28] <dbe> pitti, Want the output?
[06:28] <soundray> DevC: did you hit 'Reload' after changing it to dapper?
[06:28] <pitti> dbe: from the second command, yes; it won't fix anything, just more debug output
[06:28] <slapshot> and of course someone want to partecipate to develop
[06:29] <minimec> Joakim: Ok. I am back.
[06:29] <rmbl> sounds interesting slapshot ..
[06:29] <harry> Did they cancel the Ubuntu Open Week, I am unable to find the channel?
[06:29] <dbe> pitti, http://rafb.net/paste/results/eonR6O97.html
[06:29] <rmbl> what do you plan to include atm?
[06:29] <pitti> aaah
[06:29] <pitti> dbe: SUPPORTED='Unknown distribution: gNewSense'
[06:29] <slapshot> we are opened to suggestion
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: so, this is partly my fault
[06:30] <DevC> soundray: yeah...maybe I misspelled it but I just change breezy to dapper and click reload
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: theirs because they can have never ever tested it, and mine because this wasn't fixed yet in dapper
[06:30] <slapshot> http://www.giovelug.org/?lng=en
[06:30] <dbe> pitti, Nothing of what I've did is permanent?
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: This was fixed in edgy
[06:30] <slapshot> here is our web site and new project we are starting on
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: only the sudo sed -i
[06:30] <soundray> DevC: can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list on paste.ubuntu-nl.org pls
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: sudo sed -i 's/sh -ex/sh -e/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql-common.config
[06:30] <pitti> dbe: ^ this will revert it
[06:30] <DevC> soundray: yeah no prob
[06:31] <DevC> now that firefox is working properly lol
[06:31] <runes> before I install, what is the recommended ftp server in Ubuntu?
[06:31] <sean> I know Abobe are working on flash 9 for linux which Ubuntu will support, am I right in thinking that currently flash is version 7 in ubuntu, so that flash 8 and 9 sites don't work?
[06:31] <pitti> dbe: can you please do 'sudo gedit /usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions'
[06:31] <soundray> runes: vsftpd and proftpd are both popular choices
[06:31] <noldon> pls help i dont get sound in et and quake3
[06:32] <cello_rasp> what is the program that checks for updates in ubuntu?
[06:32] <noldon> complaining about /dev/dsp
[06:32] <pitti> cello_rasp: update-notifier
[06:32] <dbe> pitti, What do you want me do read/modify?
[06:32] <pitti> dbe: search for 'echo "Unknown distribution:'
[06:32] <pitti> dbe: below is an 'exit 1'
[06:32] <soundray> sean: yes, unless you load FP9 beta, which works well for me
[06:33] <dbe> pitti, echo "Unknown distribution: $DISTRO"
[06:33] <noldon> cello_rasp or automatix2
[06:33] <sean> soundray - ok, thanks
[06:33] <sean> soundray - any links to how I can load that?
[06:33] <LjL> !automatix | noldon
[06:33] <ubotu> noldon: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[06:33] <pitti> dbe: replace the exit 1 with 'exit 0' and insert a line before:
[06:33] <pitti> dbe: echo -e "8.1"
[06:33] <cello_rasp> not automatix or the panel applet, but the program that appears when you click on the applet
[06:34] <dbe> pitti, Sure? and then?
[06:34] <noldon> ljl for me automatix have worked out fine
[06:34] <pitti> dbe: save the file
[06:34] <pitti> dbe: then sudo apt-get -f install
[06:34] <LjL> !works for me
[06:34] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[06:34] <dbe> pitti, Then?
[06:34] <caspar> annyone can help me?
[06:34] <AsheD> so, anybody know why I can't play DVDs anymore?
[06:34] <pitti> dbe: the apt-get -f install should sort it all out
[06:35] <dbe> pitti, Works!
[06:35] <pitti> rock
[06:35] <dbe> pitti, But... What can this result in later?
[06:35] <soundray> sean: http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/
[06:35] <cello_rasp> !dvd
[06:35] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[06:35] <pitti> dbe: ok, I'll make this more robust in feisty
[06:35] <DevC> soundray: this is it with the breezy links still because when I do dapper the repositories just show the link rather than Dapper Drake -> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34379/
[06:35] <Joakim> minimec, finished smoking?
[06:35] <pitti> dbe: right now, postgresql-common really only supports Debian and Ubuntu :(
[06:35] <minimec> Joakim: yeah
[06:35] <pitti> dbe: thanks for helping me to track this down
[06:35] <dbe> pitti, I see, so I have to modify this in gNewSense each time.
[06:35] <Joakim> take a look at the IM
[06:36] <sean> soundray - it has to be compiled from source, then?
[06:36] <stro> hi guys.. i have a core 2 duo processor, however edgy only runs on 1 cpu. what am i missing?
[06:36] <pitti> dbe: if you could file a bug report in gNewSense to ask them to fix this?
[06:36] <dbe> pitti, And especially thank to you.
[06:36] <defrysk> !flash9 > sean
[06:36] <soundray> sean: I wish it would, but no.
[06:37] <stro> isn't the edgy kernel SMP capable?
[06:37] <Joakim> minimec, take a look at the pm
[06:37] <dbe> pitti, I can at least paste the output of what I did get in the begining when I tried to install it via apt.
[06:37] <sean> defrysk -  thanks
[06:37] <dbe> pitti, To the devs.
[06:37] <defrysk> sean, yw :)
[06:37] <pitti> dbe: just point out what you changed in supported_versions
[06:37] <dbe> pitti, Obsolete major version 7.4                                                                                                                             
[06:37] <dbe>                                                                                                                                                          
[06:37] <dbe>   The PostgreSQL version 7.4 is obsolete, but you still have the server and/or client package installed. Please install the latest packages              
[06:37] <dbe>   (postgresql-8.1 and postgresql-client-8.1) and upgrade your existing  clusters with pg_upgradecluster (see manpage).
[06:37] <dbe> sorry
[06:37] <pitti> dbe: that's not the right fix, but the script is easy to understand, so they can fix it
[06:37] <defrysk> !pastebin > dbe
[06:37] <pitti> dbe: right :)
[06:38] <pitti> dbe: if you install from scratch, you really don't want 7.4
[06:38] <dbe> pitti, It was a couple of more lines then I thought.
[06:38] <Joakim> minimec: my default depth is 24
[06:38] <minimec> Joakim: You can't sen de private messages without a (free) registration to freenode. I have no private messages of you. sorry.
[06:38] <Joakim> ok
[06:38] <dbe> pitti, how do I purge?
[06:38] <cello_rasp> what is the program that is run when one clicks on the update-notifier panel applet in gnome?
[06:39] <Joakim> Private Chat
[06:39] <Joakim> Didn't that work?
[06:39] <DevC> soundray: the problem I'm having is that when you enter hoary in the URI the package updater shows 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog Ubuntu and with breezy it shows 5.10 Breezy Badger Ubuntu but when I change breezy to dapper it shows the link instead of Dapper Drake
[06:39] <minimec> Joakim: so the resolution entry in xorg.conf is ok. Are you in 3d Mode. Beryl is working in 'wubbeling' mode? :)
[06:39] <Joakim> http://rafb.net/paste/results/mjyrqg52.html
[06:39] <Joakim> here's my xorg.conf
[06:40] <soundray> DevC: I don't know what you mean by package updater
[06:40] <shriphani> guys can anyone tell me why my ipod is mounted as read-only ?
[06:40] <pitti> dbe: remove the packages
[06:40] <Joakim> minimec: I seriously don't know :blush:
[06:41] <minimec> Joakim: Got that. THX.
[06:41] <DevC> soundray: System-> Administrator -> Synaptic Package Manager  and where you edit the repositories by replacing hoary/breezy/dapper/edgy/etc;
[06:41] <minimec> Joakim: Give me the 3rd or 4rth line of the outpu of glxinfo... direct rendering: ;)
[06:42] <defrysk> Joakim, you are trying to use bery l ?
[06:42] <minimec> Joakim: ... glxinfo in a terminal...
[06:42] <noldon> !splash
[06:42] <ubotu> To change the Gnome splash screen, open the gconf-editor and change the key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash-image.
[06:42] <Joakim> i use beryl
[06:43] <soundray> DevC: what happens when you configure the repos with dapper everywhere instead of breezy and hit Reload?
[06:43] <defrysk> Joakim, and have probs ?
[06:43] <defrysk> sorry missed the conversation
[06:43] <noldon> joakim is that default in ubuntu?
[06:43] <Joakim> defrysk: the resolution is 800x600
[06:43] <caspar> i want to use alsa under teamspeak, can someone help me on that?
[06:43] <defrysk> ah

[06:43] <Joakim> noldon, beryl, no
=== visualstation is now known as VisualStation
[06:43] <minimec> defrysk: he has a resolution problem with beryl... xorg.conf is ok. He is using an nvidia card.
[06:44] <Joakim> i want the resolution to be 1024x786
[06:44] <noldon> Joakim cant find it with apt-get
[06:44] <defrysk> Joakim, you seem to have forgotten one addition in xorg.conf
[06:44] <Joakim> What would that be?
[06:44] <minimec> Joakim: Tell me the output of glxinfo, please
[06:44] <Keyseir> I just got an error with gnomebaker while trying to burn a cd. Could someone point me in the direction of how to fix this problem? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34381/
[06:45] <minimec> defrysk: That could be. Iam using fglrx and radeon ;)

[06:46] <minimec> Joakim: defrysk is right. Add the 'comosite enable' thing to your xorg.conf.
[06:47] <defrysk> Joakim, like so : http://rafb.net/paste/results/wZksZ331.html
[06:47] <defrysk> Joakim, got it ? ;)

[06:48] <kalosaurusrex> yeah I noticed that too

[06:49] <DevC> soundray: brb just installed 6.06 LTS have to reboot for it to take effect
[06:50] <defrysk> Joakim, the rest should be fine but also check the specs of your monitor and compare , it does not seem to be recognized
[06:50] <defrysk> hmm too late

[07:02] <stalefries> kelly__: then look at the following;

[07:03] <dcordes> while upgrading from dapper to edgy my xserver crashed. since then i can't run it anymore. how can i run the distribution upgrade from command line?
[07:04] <kelly__> how do  you get gparted??
[07:04] <stalefries> kelly__: sudo apt-get install gparted, I imagine
[07:04] <dcordes> kelly__ sudo apt-get install gparted
[07:04] <fuffal0> stalefries, ya i guess so :)
[07:05] <berndl> the headphone jack of my laptop (pavilion dv9000 series) is not working. i know that i have to compile alsa from source (which i did twice). however, each time i'm not able to boot again. the kernel just hangs. anyone?
[07:05] <stalefries> fuffal0: you could check #ubuntuforums, that's general Ubuntu chat, but I don't know about  general freenode chat. Maybe try #freenode or perhaps #chat?
[07:05] <stalefries> random guesses
[07:05] <jbroome> #freenode-social
[07:06] <stalefries> ah
[07:06] <fuffal0> stale, no sorry, i meant "open exchange" as in the software
[07:06] <fuffal0> i misunderstood your question :)
[07:06] <PMantis> I wiped out my Dapper-->Edgy distupgraded laptop to repartition it 9on purpose). Edgy is installed, but the screen redraws are S-L-O-W. Is there a file from a backup that I can overwrite to get the same X config as before?
[07:06] <fuffal0> i think it's actually called open-xchange
[07:06] <stalefries> fuffal0: oh, never heard of that
[07:06] <FFForever> hi

[07:07] <eepberries> how can i see the mounted devices in terminal mode?
[07:07] <dcordes> i would look it up in the wiki but i can't see the link since i have no command line browser i can't do this
[07:08] <i7ch> does anyone have experience with ultraportable usb audio cards? does linux like them, generally speaking?
[07:08] <stalefries> eepberries: you can check your /media folder, also /etc/fstab is a useful file to look at
[07:08] <kelly__> dcordes i installed gedit as you said now how do i use it :S
[07:08] <dcordes> gedit
[07:08] <stalefries> !gparted
[07:08] <ubotu> gparted is a GUI partitioning program, "apt-get install gparted", also available as a live cd http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[07:08] <stalefries> kelly__: you meant gparted, right?
[07:08] <Bloodmusic> ^^very good one :)
[07:08] <lehaid> anyone knows ?
[07:09] <eepberries> alright. how can i mount a USB hard drive in terminal mode? do i have to do it manually?
[07:09] <eepberries> i plugged it in before turning the computer on but it hasn't deteced it
[07:09] <Bloodmusic> think so
[07:09] <eepberries> i've used it before though
[07:09] <kelly__> stalefries yes that is what i meant
[07:09] <stalefries> eepberries: supposedly, ubuntu should do it autmoatically
[07:09] <PMantis> stalefries, Heh, could it be that easy? :) Thanks.
[07:09] <dcordes> how can i run the upgrade-manager without xserver?
[07:09] <eepberries> stale: even in terminal mode? (my xserver is dead)
[07:09] <stalefries> kelly__: it's graphical, so just run gparted and have fun. Or perhaps sudo gparted
[07:09] <FFForever> why are the mirrors so slow atm?
[07:09] <stalefries> eepberries: x or no x, yes :)
[07:10] <eepberries> well what should i do if it isn't auto-detecting it?
[07:10] <stalefries> !mount | eepberries

[07:10] <stalefries> bah, no good
[07:10] <stalefries> eepberries: try man mount
[07:10] <stalefries> eepberries: but check if it's mounted first
[07:11] <stalefries> eepberries: cd /media
[07:11] <eepberries> stale i checked and it isn't
[07:11] <stalefries> eepberries: hmm, look at /etc/fstab

[07:13] <jbroome> Kaptah: any ports open to the outside world?
[07:13] <stalefries> hmm
[07:13] <sir-k-> can I add mp3 files as Podcast to my ipod with gtkpod?
[07:13] <sir-k-> or is there another program which can do that?
[07:13] <mc__> lehaid: anyway,there is no other choice than iptables ;)
[07:13] <stalefries> sir-k-: gtkpod is good, also lookup banshee and rhythmbox
[07:13] <poolkey172> GRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[07:13] <stalefries> lehaid: that _is_ a lot
[07:14] <eepberries> stalefries: /etc/fstab just says command not found
[07:14] <jbroome> there can be only one stateful firewall.  pf!
[07:14] <kelly__> stalefries i semm not to be able to format
[07:14] <stalefries> lehaid: lemme have a look
[07:14] <poolkey172> why is the ubuntu liveCD SO FLAKEY
[07:14] <lehaid> yeah.. and no guide on what to choose / what is the diffrence
[07:14] <sir-k-> stalefries, can they add a single mp3 file as a podcast?
[07:14] <lehaid> i thought someone here knows some of them
[07:14] <stalefries> eepberries: that's a file, do nane /etc/fstab
[07:14] <sir-k-> stalefries, so that it appears unter "podcast" in my ipod
[07:14] <Joakim> defrysk

[07:14] <Joakim> and minimec: I have 1027x768 now
[07:14] <stalefries> sir-k-: you need to edit the id3 tags to label it as a podcast
[07:14] <poolkey172> piece of junk : Sometimes I boot using the liveCD and it doesnt setup my hardware properly : no networking wrong screen res etc
[07:15] <tryll1980> can alyone tell me how to go from dapper to edgy? (is it possible to only upgrade it??)
[07:15] <minimec> Joakim: Yesssss!!!
[07:15] <minimec> Joakim: Was ist the TV Screen?
[07:15] <Joakim> But not with the flat-TV
[07:15] <VigoFusion> joakim: Shweet! how did you do it?
[07:15] <sir-k-> stalefries, can you tell me how?
[07:15] <rafaguap> Hi all... I can get my wireless recognized only if I put "acpi=off" at boot, then it doesn't see anymore my usb devices (dapper on packard bell easynote laptop)
[07:16] <Joakim> I switched monitor :p
[07:16] <VigoFusion> bleh
[07:16] <stalefries> sir-k-: not specifically, try an 'apt-cache search id3' for help
[07:16] <VigoFusion> :-P
[07:16] <tryll1980> do i just change the repos to point to edgy instead of dapper and then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade???
[07:16] <Joakim> I'll fix the flat-TV later
[07:16] <minimec> Joakim: Ok. ;)
[07:17] <runes> soundray, ok fresh install of 6.10 (desktop) added vsftpd and allowd local login but no anon..so far so good

[07:35] <jneves> luthor: can't you access the jobs through Administration -> Printing?
[07:35] <runes> thx ezenu3 weird tho /dev/hdb1 is mounted to /mnt/download but ls does nto show any of the files
[07:35] <luthor> jneves, no
[07:35] <soundray> trappist: modification time
[07:35] <luthor> jneves, the list is empty
[07:36] <luthor> but it keeps on saying it is printing
[07:36] <bobby> thanks
[07:36] <luthor> while obviously not.
[07:36] <jneves> luthor: stop and then start the printer
[07:36] <jneves> luthor: hp printer
[07:36] <luthor> phisically?
[07:36] <soundray> trappist: is the only way to get at the timestamp to extract it from ls -l output?
[07:36] <ezenu3> runes, I don't know what's with that. you're sure that there should be files there? and, I'd assume "mount" would show the same thing?
[07:36] <luthor> no is a printer connected to a gw
[07:37] <klasher> soundray, maybe diff could do it for you, with a flag or something
[07:37] <graft> runes, try typing 'cd .' and trying again
[07:37] <runes> ezenu3, there should be it's my backup files with the /home in it
[07:38] <AsheD> does Windows have anything similar to Linux's 'rsync' command [and perhaps 'mencoder' as well] ?
[07:38] <graft> you can get mencoder for windows
[07:38] <trappist> soundray: ruby -e 'p File.mtime("filename1") - File.mtime("filename2")'
[07:38] <graft> and you can get openssh for windows...
[07:38] <soundray> AsheD: you can run rsync in Cygwin
[07:38] <runes> still nothing
[07:38] <AnthonyG> Hello everyone :)
[07:38] <runes> graft still nothing
[07:38] <graft> runes - 'mount' shows it as mounted?
[07:38] <jneves> AsheD: try cygwin
[07:39] <jneves> luthor: no - on the printing panel
[07:39] <ezenu3> runes, if df shows that /dev/hdb1 has a significant amount of used bytes, and it is mounted according to it, and ls -aR /mnt/download doesn't show anything, then I don't know
[07:39] <AnthonyG> Still no luck compiling the Modem drivers , I wasn't aware Ubuntu didn't have the standard C/C++ libs pre-implemented.

[07:39] <jneves> luthor: and?
[07:39] <soundray> Wow, that works! Thanks trappist
[07:39] <luthor> no effect
[07:39] <luthor> it stays there
[07:39] <trappist> soundray: :)
[07:39] <jneves> luthor: try http://localhost:631/printers/
=== JDStone1 is now known as JDStone
[07:40] <jneves> luthor: try stopping it there
[07:40] <runes> ezenu3, I think that when I was experimenting with hardlinks to get them to show up in an ftp session..removing the hardlinks may have also removed the files
[07:40] <VigoFusion> oh heck, lemee play in the Terminal and see whats up....I have NO idea what I am doing,,,but its FUN!
[07:40] <jneves> luthor: (use a login and pass from a user in lpadmin)
[07:41] <AnthonyG> VigoFusion: Play too much and you will get yourself into trouble , I had to unplug my machine due to random Terminal goodness :D
[07:41] <graft> erm... sounds like it's time to trot out your undeleting utils, runes
[07:41] <VigoFusion> the lspci brought it up
=== james is now known as Hoag
[07:41] <runes> graft any help will do as I may have mentioned several months ago I migrated from server 2003 to linux so I'm still really REALLY green
[07:42] <soundray> runes: files with multiple hardlinks don't get removed before you remove the last link.
[07:42] <Hoag> Anyone?
[07:42] <runes> soundray, well after the last experiment I just gave up and reinestalled 6.10 on the hda
[07:43] <graft> runes, what does df report for usage on that disk?
[07:43] <runes> soundray, without unlinking...and when I reinstalled then mounted the hdb1 I see nothing
[07:43] <AnthonyG> Would anyone happen to know which package I need to compile things like drivers? I know it needs the standard libs(stdio,math,etc.) but what else?
[07:43] <soundray> runes: well, you can't hardlink across filesystems of course
[07:43] <runes> graft, 1% 131212
[07:43] <jbroome> build-essential
[07:43] <AnthonyG> build-essential won't help either , I'm unable to use the Terminal at the moment.

[07:49] <runes> graft, is there a way to easily repartition /format
[07:49] <jneves> abes: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[07:49] <Sp4rKy> but now, i want to add mailman list manager, and the lists doesn't seems to work. Does anyone have some tutorial which works ?
[07:49] <VigoFusion> AnthonyG: Reso is at like wait a sec...
[07:49] <graft> runes: it ought to be ext3 formatted anyway...
[07:49] <jneves> luthor: is the printer local or on a different machine?

[07:50] <runes> graft gopard is showing 1.32 gig used
[07:50] <snIphe> I can install the driver under BackTrack, Debian, but not Ubuntu....i have installed the build-essentials and gcc 3.3 gcc 4.0 make and kernel-headers
[07:51] <soundray> Skwid_: "scanning" shows all networks that are available to your setup. The dropdown list in the gnome networking setup should show the available networks, too.
[07:51] <abes> jneves: the following packages have unmet dependencies: // ubuntu desktop: Depends: gnome-applets but is not going to be installed // Depends: gnome-control-center, etc
[07:51] <luthor> jneves, is on a different machine
[07:51] <soundray> Skwid_: the one under "ESSID"
[07:51] <AnthonyG> VigoFusion: At least you've got your 56K modem working , More than I can say.
[07:51] <VigoFusion> AnthonyG: Resolution is at 800x600,,,yes, I have my TRS-80 still working.

[07:51] <klasher> oh know the stock market crashed
[07:51] <luthor> jneves, but i want to retouch the configuration on THIS machine
[07:51] <snIphe> some one knows why I can`t do that in my new Ubuntu ??

[07:52] <runes> ls
[07:52] <VigoFusion> AnthonyG: Thats a modem for my Laptop, I dunno why it works.
[07:52] <graft> runes: some fraction of the disk gets used up to support the filesystem, i think...
[07:52] <abes> jneves: after all if i try to install one by one it tells me that there is a problem with gnome-control-center
[07:52] <soundray> snIphe: you may have to make a link from /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build to /usr/src/kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
[07:52] <jneves> luthor: forget that - it's cups - the configuration is in the remote machine, not in the local one
[07:53] <luthor> jneves, they are not matching
[07:53] <jneves> abes: which is?
[07:53] <snIphe> [soundray]  Im going to try it...
[07:53] <luthor> i added a wrong printer
[07:53] <luthor> tried to print
[07:53] <abes> jneves: any ideas how to restore EVERYTHING... like all the packages with UBUNTU logo in synaptic?
[07:53] <AnthonyG> Anyone care to help? I'm in desperate need of assistance , And the constant rebooting is killing me (and likely my machine).
[07:53] <luthor> and now is stuck
[07:53] <jneves> abes: have you changed the repostiries?
[07:53] <ActivE> Hey, when i try and run Xvnc i get the error: could not open default font 'fixed'. Any ideas?
[07:54] <jneves> abes: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop is the way
[07:54] <klasher> Anthony, you have a laptop?
[07:54] <AnthonyG> No
[07:54] <abes> jneves: i didnt change them... i might have added some though
[07:54] <graft> what's your prob, AnthonyG?
[07:54] <chrisloukas> e
[07:54] <chrisloukas> kalispera
[07:54] <jneves> abes: but you seem to have another problem there - what's the error with gnome-control center
[07:54] <abes> jneves: ubuntu-desktop doesnt install
[07:54] <soundray> AnthonyG: don't worry about the rebooting, at least not as far as your machine is concerned.
[07:54] <AnthonyG> graft: I believe I have the correct driver for my modem , But I can't seem to find the needed libs to compile them. I know I need the standard libs.
[07:54] <ezenu3> for grep, is there a symbol to represent NOT?
[07:55] <jneves> luthor: stop cups - /etc/init.d/cupsys stop; remove jobs in /var/spool/cups
[07:55] <kjodleik> I'm trying to recompile the latest kernel i edgy. however when I boot my kernel it claims not to be able to access tty and halts the boot sequence. any ideas?
[07:55] <jneves> luthor: start cups again
[07:55] <trappist> ezenu3: grep -v
[07:55] <graft> AnthonyG: no kernel driver for it?
[07:55] <AnthonyG> soundray: But what about my sanity?
[07:55] <trappist> ezenu3: also in a regex, [^x]  means not x
[07:55] <jneves> abes: what's the error when you try to install gnome-control-center?
[07:55] <abes> jneves: The following packages have unmet dependencies: nautilus: Depends: gnome-control-center (>= 2.6) but is not going to be installed // E: Broken packages
[07:55] <ezenu3> trappist, thanks, for both :)
[07:55] <AnthonyG> graft: I don't believe it supports Lucent/Agere.
[07:55] <graft> AnthonyG: um, what sort of modem is this?
[07:55] <Skwid_> soundray: any reason why it wouldnt recognize the ssids ?
[07:55] <jneves> abes: apt-get install gnome-control-center
[07:56] <abes> jneves: when i try to install gnome-control-center it gives me the error with capplets-data dependency
[07:56] <jneves> luthor: don't forget sudo
[07:56] <jneves> abes: which error?
[07:56] <MarcN> ActivE: I had that same problem. Forgot the fix though... ;-)
[07:56] <AnthonyG> graft: Elaborate... It's a 56K Agere Systems PCI SoftModem (V.92)
[07:56] <jneves> abes: I'm not looking at your computer...
[07:56] <MarcN> ActivE: I think it was some missing font packages.

[08:04] <trappist> TurtleBoots: I use xine
[08:05] <abes> jneves: i have some extra urls there due to downloading codecs - should i remove them so its like it was in the beginning?
[08:05] <TurtleBoots> thanks guys... I'll apt-get it :-)

[08:05] <jneves> abes: apt-get dist-upgrade
[08:05] <TurtleBoots> Heril: I've got mplayer installed but it won't play the DVD for some reason
[08:05] <jneves> abes: maybe not
[08:05] <jneves> abes: comment those out first
[08:06] <jneves> abes: it's safer
[08:06] <jneves> abes: then do a apt-get update

[08:12] <jneves> abes: same problem?
[08:12] <abes> jneves: i told you there was no chage.... still the same problem with all the dependencies
[08:12] <TurtleBoots> trappist: where is that file?
[08:12] <abes> jneves: yeah
[08:12] <EDinNY> does anyone know where to find a flash player package for firefox?
[08:12] <DevC> ok how do I configure Xserver when it doesn't load properly? alll of a sudden while restarting xserver crashed on me and won't load...booted me into GDM and said I needed to configure Xserver? how do I do that?
[08:12] <AnthonyG> graft: Isn't the latest release's kernel version 2.16?
[08:12] <trappist> TurtleBoots: /etc/X11
[08:12] <graft> AnthonyG: um, i'm running 2.6.15-23-686
[08:12] <graft> AnthonyG: uname -a to see what you're running
[08:13] <Chewy954> can someone help me?
[08:13] <soundray> trappist: could you just quickly tell me how to access arguments inside a ruby script? I tried ARGV[0]  but that's not it...
[08:13] <Chewy954> im having problems with xmms
[08:13] <EDinNY> Chewy954: donlt know...ask first
[08:13] <xen> Yo, how do I change the default text editor?
[08:13] <maxxism> Chewy954 everyone has problems with xmms.  it sucks now.
[08:13] <TurtleBoots> has anyone here ever edited the xorg.conf file to allow connection to external output?
[08:14] <jneves> DevC: alt+f1, login with your login and password, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:14] <graft> why still use xmms?
[08:14] <Chewy954> i set it as my defualt audio player, but when i double click a song, it loads up but wont play that song
[08:14] <Chewy954> i like the skins for it
[08:14] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots: ask on #ltsp
[08:14] <Chewy954> whats a better audio player?
[08:14] <maxxism> Chewy954 give Beep media player a try.  it works well for me.  and has xmms skins support
[08:14] <graft> just about anything
[08:14] <graft> !player
[08:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about player - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:14] <Chewy954> cool
[08:15] <graft> orgh. what's that thing...?
[08:15] <maxxism> Chewy954 its in the repos.
[08:15] <TurtleBoots> EdinNY: I'm not quite sure what you mean?
[08:15] <Chewy954> what?
[08:15] <Chewy954> o_O
[08:15] <AnthonyG> graft: :| , I need to pay more attention , It likely is 2.15 then. I can't shout at the terminal at the moment , I booted into XP.
[08:15] <TurtleBoots> by #ltsp
[08:15] <maxxism> Chewy954 sorry its in Synaptic.
[08:15] <graft> AnthonyG: you probably aren't running 2.15, those are development series - production are always even numbered
[08:15] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots: try  "/join #ltsp".  they use this in their project
[08:15] <Chewy954> ok
[08:15] <Skwid_> the only difference between xubuntu/ubuntu is xfce/gnome ????
[08:15] <yahalom> my video stopped working. I get error opening/initializing the selected video_out
[08:16] <yahalom> any ideas please?
[08:16] <Chewy954> whats the difference between blag and ubuntu?
[08:16] <graft> AnthonyG: but you should find your matching kernel version and download the appropriate driver, then you should be able to build it no p roblem
[08:16] <Chewy954> like major differences
[08:16] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots: I assume you want to view an X application run locally on a remote machine
[08:16] <graft> Skwid_: yep
[08:16] <budluva> anyone here install beryl from the wiki page? the repo for lrm is down, and im wondering if there's any way i can go around it?

[08:17] <graft> Skwid_: xfce? wouldn't know, i haven't used either... :P

[08:17] <graft> Skwid_: though rumor has it xfce is quite light
[08:17] <Skwid_> graft: ok :)

[08:17] <TurtleBoots> EDinNY: I was hoping to use the VGA slot ??
[08:17] <soundray> trappist: no worries, I've worked it out
[08:18] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots: you need a vid card in that slot that supports TV out
[08:18] <Skwid_> graft: thank you :)
[08:18] <Chewy954> maxxism, bmp or bmpx?
[08:18] <parik70> whom may i ask information on ubuntu in italian to???
[08:18] <maxxism> bmp i think
[08:19] <Chewy954> bmpx is the new version of it
[08:19] <TurtleBoots> EDinNY: VGA slot works on (dare I mention it) Windblows so it should also work on Ubuntu ???
[08:19] <maxxism> x then
[08:19] <parik70> any italian ?
[08:19] <_abes_> jneves: got disconnected....
[08:19] <Chewy954> ok, im asking becuase in the synaptic it shows like wma things for bmp only not bmp
=== _abes_ is now known as turbopc
[08:19] <Chewy954> will it work for bmpx aswell?
[08:19] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots: you need a video card that has televsion out

[08:20] <jneves> _abes_: that explains it

[08:21] <parik70> #ubuntu-it
[08:21] <EDinNY> TurtleBoots:  then I can't help you
[08:21] <TurtleBoots> EDinNY: no not straight off, so I assumed that there was a bit of tweaking required??
[08:21] <poolkey172> maybe I should just give up

[08:23] <EDinNY> is there a flash package for firefox?

[08:24] <tonyyarusso> bug #68014
[08:24] <soundray> poolkey172: adobe.com
[08:24] <tonyyarusso> bah - wrong chan
[08:24] <Block> I am thinking about upgrading my cpu from an old amd to a nwer intel. The question is: will my ubuntu installation handle a motherboard change or will it freak out like a windows system?
[08:24] <strabes> poolkey172: labs.adobe.com
[08:24] <turbopc> where would be my USB key located by default?
[08:25] <strabes> poolkey172: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[08:25] <poolkey172> hiya soundtray : I'm still strugglin : I know what my problems with grub and the raid are
[08:25] <maxxism> Block it depends if you changes your kernel to a K7 derivative.
[08:25] <poolkey172> thanks trabes
[08:25] <strabes> turbopc: probably in /media
[08:25] <soundray> turbopc: probably in the top drawer, with the pencils and crayons
[08:25] <Block> maxxism: My idea is to run a generic 486 under the upgrade
[08:25] <soundray> poolkey172: go on...
[08:26] <maxxism> Block just make sure your kernel is a standard 386 one and your upgrade should go fine.
[08:26] <bushidom> 	http://marihuana.have-a-rose.com/?s=12082&n=bushido
[08:26] <DevC> damn it! I can't get the xserver to load the GUI anymore
[08:26] <Block> maxxism: ok, nice
[08:26] <maxxism> Block what are you buying?  Core2?
[08:27] <TurtleBoots> anyone else here connected their Ubuntu box to an external output?
[08:27] <soundray> DevC: no need to swear. 'tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log' and see if you can see the reason
[08:27] <poolkey172> soundkey : its essentially the way the BIOS orders the disks ie disk1 is raidon11controller disk2 is raid on different controller disk3 is a simple IDE
[08:27] <budluva> bushidom, is there an english version?
[08:27] <budluva> :P
[08:27] <poolkey172> soundkey : When in linux : the kernel orders them differently
[08:27] <warren282> hello
[08:28] <Block> maxxism: You seem to know your stuff so I ask you another question :). A few days ago I "upgraded" from a standard desktop cpu to a mobile one, but I cannot get cpu scaling to work (it worked perfectly in windows so I know it works). Any ideas?
[08:28] <Heril> warren282: Hi
[08:28] <poolkey172> soundkey : I need to mess around with grubs device.map
[08:28] <soundray> poolkey172: try to use UUIDs for accessing your partitions then.
[08:28] <warren282> I have a problem with a realtek ac97 sound chip
[08:28] <warren282> alc883
[08:28] <maxxism> Block  it is in the power settings i think.
[08:28] <warren282> I haven't sound but i'm a bit noob :p
[08:28] <poolkey172> soundkey : How will UUIDs work if grub doesn't even see the disk
[08:29] <Block> maxxism: yeah, looking at intel core, mostly because it is relativly cheap and runs efficient.
[08:29] <warren282> what ca I do?
[08:29] <maxxism> Block Core's are the bomb right now.
[08:29] <Heril> warren: what exactly is your problem
[08:29] <warren282> Does I have to install the realtek drivers form the realtek site?
[08:29] <Block> maxxism: I cannot load the module "poswernow-k7"??
[08:29] <warren282> I haven't sound and I don't know how to solve
[08:29] <poolkey172> soundkey : this is a low level issue : Anyone know if I can create a boot floopy with a custom built kernel that I can boot with ?
[08:30] <maxxism> Block  yeah that is for a AMD chip.  no anything K7 is amd.
[08:30] <DevC> soundray: lol it says 'no core keyboard' 'fatal server error: failed to initialize core devices'
[08:30] <foosh>  /msg nickserv set unfiltered on
[08:31] <Block> maxxism: the mobile is an amd mobile barton, sorry for not mentioning it.
[08:32] <darksh3ll> salut a tous
[08:32] <soundray> DevC: I suggest you 'sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-nonworking' and create a new config with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[08:32] <maxxism> Block hmmm.   never seen that one.
[08:32] <docgnome> I have an HP Laserjet 1018 connected to my Ubuntu Edgy box and I want to share it with my MacBook. Does anyone know how to do that or where there is a tutorial about it?
[08:32] <Heril> warren: If your sound card isn't recognized by alsa on your system, then you need to install the aproprate drivers
[08:32] <poolkey172> Anyone know if I can create a boot floopy with dmraid enabled ?
[08:32] <maxxism> Block I bet soundray knows something of it.  that guy knows everything.  hehe

[08:37] <maxxism> Chewy954 didnt know that.  good to know.

[08:41] <Chewy954> i might get opera
[08:41] <snIphe> ok
[08:41] <rickyfingers> snIphe: but it's not a conclusive answer, as far as I can tell.
[08:41] <Heril> Chewy: Do you know what processor you have?
[08:42] <ouroboros> Hello hello good day!  :)
[08:43] <cookieninja> simply typing, without quotes "more /proc/cpuinfo" will provide you with cpu info
[08:43] <Chewy954> Heril, yea intel pentium 4
[08:43] <snIphe> aha I understand you
[08:43] <cookieninja> typing that in a shell window, that is
[08:43] <rickyfingers> snIphe: I'm running a different kernel version than you, but I have /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-10/scripts/gcc-version.sh
[08:44] <ouroboros> I have been trying without success to set up a uvcvideo device.  It IS listed a supported by that driver.
[08:44] <ouroboros> Anyone have great knowledge of uvc?
[08:44] <snIphe> ok im goint to see if i have it too
[08:45] <rickyfingers> snIphe: if it's there and you're getting this error message, most likely permissions are not correctly set on it.
[08:46] <Chewy954> Heril
[08:46] <Chewy954> ?
[08:46] <snIphe> no I havn`t got it in this directory. I have other directories and a Makefile
[08:47] <Heril> Chewy: you could use the debian package, but it might not work completley right
[08:47] <rickyfingers> snIphe: then I would try re-installing kernel headers for your kernel with synaptic, or whatever you're most comfortable with
[08:47] <Heril> Chewy at the getswiftfox siite
[08:47] <snIphe> ok I`m going to use synaptic
[08:47] <rickyfingers> snIphe: missing files (usually) -> missing package

[08:53] <hydro> hello, does anyone know what version of Java (if any) comes bundled with Edgy? I want to upgrade from Dapper Drake to Edgy and was hoping that Java 5 comes bundled with Edgy but perhaps not (considering some of the historically tricky licensing issues with Sun).
[08:53] <hydro> the version of Java with Ubuntu was not easy to find despite searching on the site and Wiki
=== davehat_away is now known as davehat

[08:56] <czer323> I'm having issues with trying to boot from an alt install disc, it says i'm missing modules "ide-core" and some others, and then my cdrom can't be read.  I've tried modprobing those modules from the command prompt beforehand, but it's not even on the disc.  And advice?  Perhaps a different cd, or suggesting compiling a new kernel for it with those modules somehow?
[08:56] <budluva> tannerld, hrmm...im having problems, i click on the gem, then goto select window manager, then beryl, and nothing happens
[08:56] <rhalff> otherwise I'm giving the wrong advice :)
[08:57] <rickyfingers> snIphe: that's what I was going to suggest, but it may be overkill.  There's almost always a way to fix things without going that far.
[08:57] <tannerld> budluva: try #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[08:57] <rickyfingers> snIphe: however, I would do what you are suggesting.
[08:57] <NoUse> rhalff yes the desktop iso is the live cd

[08:58] <NoUse> rhalff if she installs it from the live cd she could
[08:59] <rhalff> NoUse, there is an option when you start that cd to install ?
[08:59] <NoUse> rhalff no, there is an icon on the desktop
[08:59] <rhalff> ah ok, I'll tell her not to do it then :) for now.. :)
[09:00] <the_mug> any idea why Apache 2.2.3 is not included in Edgy?
[09:00] <snIphe> pffff the important thing is that Im tring to make wardriving over my laptop....I think for myself....when this problems hapends in a production system ?
[09:00] <rickyfingers> the_mug: I don't know, but installing apache from source has always gone pretty smoothly for me.
[09:01] <rickyfingers> the_mug: and you can even use --prefix options to control where the final installation goes, so it won't interfere with default apache
[09:01] <ouroboros> Anyone... reiterating... running Dapper, trying to get a Logitech Quickcam Fusion working.  UVC driver compiled and installed fine and modprobe reported no errors...
[09:02] <the_mug> rickyfingers: I know! that's what I always do... but my friend wants to have an all package ubuntu server. :-/
[09:02] <mrlinux> need help setting up dhcp on edubuntu
[09:03] <rickyfingers> the_mug: then may I suggest (not intending offense) your friend is thinking "inside the box" too much.

[09:05] <anorexicpillow> hi
[09:06] <Kaptah> Asked moment ago about firewalls, some1 replied, but i got here into a situation. No, I don't have ports open, i guess.. I'm quite noob with Linux
[09:06] <eneried> I think nobody knows how to fix that problem
[09:07] <waldo> i am trying to get nessus working (edgy installed) using apt-get and i keep getting a core dump when i try to start the daemon... anyone know y?
[09:07] <Kaptah> So, should i use a firewall? Any recommendations for which software ?
[09:08] <waldo> Kaptah, the most common <i think, not s ure> is firestarted
[09:08] <waldo> firestarter*
[09:08] <Kaptah> thnx, maybe i'll give it a try..
[09:08] <tuxtux> ciao a tutti
[09:08] <snIphe> well tomorroy Ill continue with this....thank all of you
[09:08] <tomiboi_> anyone uses amaroK?
[09:09] <to_s> How can I restore the ubuntu boot splash screen?
[09:09] <Kaptah> what about anti-virus ?
[09:09] <eneried> ciao tuxtux
[09:09] <mrlinux> some help setting up my dhcp please
[09:09] <to_s> I installed the edubuntu artwork by mistake
[09:09] <tomiboi_> clamAV as anti-virus
[09:09] <to_s> the apt-get remove didn't help
[09:09] <waldo> Kaptah, tomiboi_ is right...
[09:09] <waldo> calmAV
[09:09] <waldo> anyone know why nessus is giving a core dump when i try to start the daemon?
[09:10] <tomiboi_> clamAV from AUTOMATIX package
[09:11] <tomiboi_> should I use MySQL with amaroK?
[09:11] <mrlinux> need help with ltsp
[09:11] <waldo> tomiboi_, i use sqlite
[09:11] <waldo> easier to use
[09:11] <tomiboi_> is there a difference?
[09:11] <waldo> yea
[09:11] <tomiboi_> SQlite vs MySQL?
[09:12] <waldo> yea there is a difference
[09:12] <mrlinux> any and all help
[09:12] <Kaptah> clamAV...  what about Panda, is it any good?
[09:12] <tomiboi_> what can I use for podcasts (in terms of podcatching)
[09:13] <czer323> I'm having issues with trying to boot from an alt install disc, it says i'm missing modules "ide-core" and some others, and then my cdrom can't be read.  I've tried modprobing those modules from the command prompt beforehand, but it's not even on the disc.  And advice?  Perhaps a different cd, or suggesting compiling a new kernel for it with those modules somehow?
[09:13] <tomiboi_> Panda is ok.
[09:13] <mrlinux> does any one know any thing about ltsp
[09:14] <tomiboi_> there is also AVAST and ANTI-VIR as AV software
[09:14] <tomiboi_> I rarely use it though.
[09:14] <waldo> most people arent to concerned with virus software when running linux
[09:14] <waldo> anti-virus*
[09:14] <mrlinux> czer323, use a different cd. if that dont help than swich out to a different cdrom drive
[09:14] <NoUse> tomiboi_ ipodder is in universe, if you want something more actively developed check out CastPodder
[09:15] <Seth_> hello, please tell me the distribution or wiki site for unbutu
[09:15] <waldo> czer323, how can u boot from cd, but then not be able to read the cd
[09:15] <docgnome> waldo: unless they are running a windows based network with a linux gateway
[09:15] <Kaptah> thought anti-virus would be to good have having samba in mind
[09:15] <tomiboi_> is Cast Podder web-based?
[09:15] <ein_> seth: use google
[09:15] <NoUse> tomiboi_ no they are both desktop applications
[09:15] <mrlinux> need help with ltsp
[09:15] <Seth_> google mainly drops me into problem solving sites
[09:15] <Dreamglider> Seth_, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
[09:15] <waldo> gotcha, sorry... i dont use samba so i guess i jumped to a conclusion
[09:16] <Seth_> ah, thx
[09:16] <Dreamglider> np
[09:16] <tomiboi_> anything in terms of web-based apps
[09:16] <sox> #ubuntu-classroom
[09:16] <mrlinux> i need help to config my dhcp in ltsp
[09:16] <Seth_> ah, should read topics again, sorry
[09:16] <_Dbug_> Hi. I've been looking on the help pages but could not find anything, so I try here. Is it possible when you have two keyboards on the same machine (let's say a Laptop with additional usb keyboard) to have different language settings on each ?
[09:16] <waldo> anyone successfully get nessus running on edgy?
[09:17] <czer323> waldo, mrlinux, i've tried about 5 different distros.  its' not the cd, promise.  i need to load modules for the ide bus to understand how to do stuff.
[09:17] <Lynoure>  /join #ubuntu-classroom
[09:17] <Lynoure> sorry
[09:18] <Zaehlas> Hello all, I'm back again.  I'm hoping that someone can still help me with this.  I have 36 gigs or so of extra "allocated" space on my drive that is not represented by files.  I DID delete 36 gigs of files, so that's probably related, but waiting, and using fsck at boot do not seem to clear the allocated space.  Is there any way to try a different type of fsck at boot, or pass options to it, or a utility that could fix this file allocati
[09:18] <Dreamglider> help with wireless network 6.10, it worked in 6.06 but now in .10 i cant get online
[09:20] <mrlinux> czer323, different distros use different depenances make sure that your burning the files inside the iso no just the iso its self. also what burning program are you useing
[09:21] <mrlinux> need help with ltsp dhcp config
[09:21] <czer323> mrlinux, it's not the cd.  i can boot the cd up to the text installer and try loading the modules froma  shell.
[09:21] <czer323> but, the modules aren't on the disc.
[09:21] <_Dbug_> If someone could just point me out on some url explaining how to configure more than one keyboard, would be nice :)
[09:22] <mrlinux> czer323, try a different iso
[09:22] <czer323> mrlinux, i'm using the alt xubuntu 6.06.1 installer and the ubuntu 6.10 installer
[09:22] <czer323> mrlinux, if you can't give me more advice beyond the cd... just don't bother.
[09:22] <czer323> i know it's not the cd.
[09:23] <noldon> !quake2
[09:23] <ubotu> quake2: improved version of id Software's Quake II engine. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1:0.3-1.1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1240 kB, installed size 3144 kB
[09:23] <mrlinux> czer323, ok i wont. but personaly i think you have a id10t error
[09:23] <Rocito> HI, quick question: How do i set up a sound server so multiple applications can play sound a the same time (e.g games+teamspeak+xmms)
[09:24] <Crankymonky> I'll vouch for czer323 not having a PEBKAM
[09:24] <czer323> mrlinux, I think you're an idiot too, so thanks.
[09:24] <sioux> hi
[09:24] <Crankymonky> Hey
[09:24] <mrlinux> czer323, at least we agree on something
[09:25] <sioux> I have problems with x-mplayer2 plugin... seems it is not installed but i have mplayer and it's plug.in for firefox. something is changed?
[09:25] <kitsuneofdoom> most window managers and xnest stop working complaining about fonts.
[09:25] <mrlinux> any help with ltsp's dhcp
[09:25] <docgnome> Rocito: I think that is refered to as sound multiplexing. Alsa should do that automatically if you have a sound card that supports it... I think. I could be wrong though. It's been a while since I've messed with it.
[09:25] <NoUse> mrlinux have you asked in #ltsp?
[09:25] <RvGaTe> Does ubuntu automaticly detect and setup dual screen?
[09:26] <Zaehlas> Hello all, I'm back again.  I'm hoping that someone can still help me with this.  I have 36 gigs or so of extra "allocated" space on my drive that is not represented by files.  I DID delete 36 gigs of files, so that's probably related, but waiting, and using fsck at boot do not seem to clear the allocated space.  Is there any way to try a different type of fsck at boot, or pass options to it, or a utility that could fix this file allocati
[09:26] <mrlinux> no theres a channel like that
[09:26] <Rocito> dognome, nope it doesnt seem to work
[09:26] <czer323> soop, let's try this again.  I can boot the install disc up to where it asks to select a language. shortly afterwards, it hangs while detecting hardware.  i use alt-f4 to look at the dmesgs, and it says hw-detect: missing modules: ide-core, ide-hd, ide-cd and a few others.  I tried using alt-f2 to load a shell and manually load them with modprobe and insmod, but the modules don't exist on the cd.  Any suggestions.
[09:26] <mrlinux> nouse, thanks thats my id10t error
[09:26] <Rocito> czer323: seems something wrong with either the cd, or your memory
[09:26] <czer323> THis has happened with multiple ubuntu/xubuntu/6.10 and 6.06.1 issues.
[09:27] <czer323> rocito, i'm running a memtest on the computer now and it's passed everything.
[09:27] <Zaehlas> czer323: I just had a problem like that today, and after several swaps, I realized my motherboard had fried.  changed to new motherboard, and it worked.  If you have a good cd, then start by swapping cdrom, if same, swap cable, if same, swap motherboard, after that, new computer?
[09:27] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Empty your recycle bin.
[09:27] <czer323> Zaehlas, not possible, it's a laptop.
[09:27] <mrlinux> nouse, can you help me
[09:27] <Rocito> czer323, then your out of luck :S
[09:28] <NoUse> mrlinux never used ltsp
[09:28] <Zaehlas> czer323: even the IDE chip (or cdrom interface chip) on a laptop motherboard can go bad.  sorry, that's the only solution I can think of
[09:28] <TSWoodV> czer323: First, check the CDs and make sure they're good.  Then run "memtest86" and see what you get.
[09:28] <mrlinux> nouse, just need help with dhcp
[09:28] <Crankymonky> Zaehlas, That's not a solution, it's a problem
[09:28] <czer323> TSWoodV, have done.  it's fine.  i tried to tell this to everyone already.  The cd is fine.
[09:28] <Zaehlas> TSWoodv: Sorry, I had done that a while ago, and double checked it's empty since then, unless my trash bin errored out.  any utilities to look into that?
[09:29] <kitsuneofdoom> some window managers (fvwm, some other light ones, not openbox, metacity, and kwin, though) and xnest stopped working, complaining about fonts.
[09:29] <Euler> hi all...anyone here succesfully to a net install of ubuntu on a sun t1000?
[09:29] <shwag> anyone ever tried, or know of a guide, for doing a full OS reinstall on a remote machine ?
[09:29] <TSWoodV> czer323: I just got here.  Sorry.  Try turning off DMA at the "linux:" prompt.  I think it's "ide=nodma"
[09:30] <Zaehlas> Crankymonky: I know it's a problem, I had to swap out a motherboard today.  on a laptop, it's even worse of a problem, but if CD = good, then software = good, then all that's left is hardware  **shrug**
[09:30] <kelly__> why does frostwire keep locking up
[09:31] <czer323> TSWoodV, yeah, i've tried ide=nodma, pci=bios, noacpi and a few others without any luck.
[09:31] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: So you're saying that you deleted files via the GUI and you've not seen an increase in free space, right?
[09:32] <kelly__> does anyone know the prgrame frostwire
[09:32] <TSWoodV> czer323: Can you get an external CD drive, say an USB one, and try to install from there?
[09:32] <gbrent> I accidently took my name off of the suddoers list and cant do any sudo commands. Any idea how to get back on it?
[09:32] <gbrent> or am I screwed?
[09:32] <czer323> TSWoodV, it's an older laptop, it doesn't support usb booting, but i don't have an external drive anyway.  Good idea though.
[09:33] <Zaehlas> tswoodv: that's correct.  I've used several file checks, and done the sudo touch *something?* forcefsck several times to try and use fsck to fix, but nothing.  I have a screenshot on my server (graphical) that illustrates, but since it's not the safe text ubuntu server, don't click on it if you don't want, otherwise, just a GIF file: http://www.ultralarp.com/DiskUsage.gif
[09:33] <TSWoodV> czer323: Then you're left with one option - network installation.
[09:33] <dmnd> gbrent: start the 2nd option from the grub menu and set it back?
[09:33] <Madpilot> gbrent, you'll have to reboot into the recovery console
[09:33] <Lam_> gbrent: when starting up the computer, load the Recovery Mode instead of the normal. you can fix yourself that way with root access
[09:33] <kelly__> does anyone know the programe frostwire
[09:33] <Euler> T1000? anyone?
[09:33] <czer323> TSWoodV, I've been looking into how to do it.  Any suggestions on faqs on where to start?
[09:33] <TSWoodV> gbrent: visudo
[09:33] <lmh>  I have a really strange prob: Ubuntu Desktop CD works perfect with my video card (Matrox G550) and CPU (AMD64), after installation it does not show anything, lcd goes into energy-save-state
[09:33] <gbrent> Sweet! thanks guys... is there anyway i can do this remotley? i am ssh'd in
[09:34] <TSWoodV> czer323: I've done it with Fedora many a time.  I've not seen any docs on how to do it with Ubuntu yet.  Lemme check a bit...
[09:34] <Lam_> gbrent: probably not
[09:34] <dmnd> lmh: start with a low resolution first and built up higher, or your hsync and vsync is wrong in xorg.conf
[09:34] <kelly__> this is fun
[09:34] <TSWoodV> gbrent: If you can't ssh in as root or another account that has sudo ability, you're pretty much toast...
[09:34] <kelly__> i need help with frostwire
[09:34] <lmh> dmnd: i tried that, probably the driver makes a prob?
[09:34] <n3rdism> how i haxor?
[09:35] <Skwid_> how can i solve character problems in my fat32 mounted windows partition ?
[09:35] <TSWoodV> gbrent: Advice:  Always have a back door of some sort.
[09:35] <Skwid_> (french accents)
[09:35] <lmh> dmnd: no (EE) section in Log-File
[09:35] <kelly__> i shall go back to windows
[09:35] <n3rdism> f10 gets unlimited amo
[09:35] <sioux> who fixed the x-mplayer2 plug-in for firefox2?
[09:35] <gbrent> TSWoodV: Yeah that is what I was figuring. So once I boot in recovery I use visudo to edit the suddoers file correct?
[09:35] <TSWoodV> gbrent: Right.
[09:36] <n3rdism> lol ok back to work :D
[09:36] <gbrent> TSWOOD: is that /etc/suddoers?
[09:36] <lmh> dmnd: another idea?
[09:36] <lmh> anybody else an idea?
[09:36] <Lam_> gbrent: how'd you take yourself off the sudoer's list without knowing what file it was?
[09:36] <TSWoodV> gbrent: Yep.  Use the "visudo" command.  It'll pick the right file and handle any concurrency issues (not that you'll have any in recovery mode, however).
[09:37] <Zaehlas> ?
[09:37] <gbrent> Lam_: Not sure. I remember doing a bunch of usermods and I was changing groups around an I think I changed my group
[09:37] <lmh> Nobody an idea?
[09:38] <lmh> I found no known prob about AMD64 and Matrox
[09:38] <lmh> (mga - xorg driver)
[09:38] <Gh0sty> lmh: could it be that frequency is too high for you monitor?
[09:38] <gbrent> Lam_: By default, the main user you set up.... what groups are they a part of?
[09:38] <Gh0sty> i had  that too with my dualscreen ... :/
[09:38] <compengi> what's the command from with i will download all the packages needed for a certain program?
[09:38] <Lam_> gbrent: they are part of their own group.  if your username was "ubuntu", you'd be defaulted into an "ubuntu" group
[09:39] <gbrent> compengi: apt-get install programname
[09:39] <eloque> sup people
[09:39] <Gh0sty> lmh: otherwise try in grub to add a parameter like vga=xxx
[09:39] <lmh> Gh0sty: don't think so, tried a lot of resolutions, have a LCD which tells me "out of video resolution...)
[09:39] <Richard__> urgghhh I need help with mythtv :(
[09:39] <compengi> gbrent, not this one
[09:39] <Gh0sty> with xxx some number but i dont know by head ...
[09:39] <gbrent> Lam_: sweet. I think I changed myself to the root group
[09:39] <Skwid_> what files do i need to share to get data between linux and windows ?
[09:39] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: There's a lot of places to look in "/" for stuff.  It could be that you've got a process that's using up /tmp as fast as you empty it.
[09:39] <Gh0sty> lmh: or is it a dual head card maybe?
[09:39] <Lam_> compengi: if you're going to compile a program, use apt-get build-dep programname to get developer files
[09:39] <lmh> Gh0sty: on console works wonderfully, only gnome not
[09:40] <Gh0sty> otherwise it takes you secondary maybe as the standard?
[09:40] <eloque> anybody here ran ubuntu as a virtual machine from windows? (being that i have ubuntu installed on a local partition and dont wanna run it as a live cd)
[09:40] <Gh0sty> ah :/
[09:40] <lmh> Gh0sty: is a dualhead, yes
[09:40] <compengi> Lam_, yeah that's what i wanted thanks
[09:40] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Do this.  Run "du -sk /" .  It'll take a while, but you just might find out which directory or directories is eating your disk space.
[09:40] <ziopeppe> hey! anyone can help me? i have a problem when i turn off my pc. My pc doesn't shut, it block at the end of the process. The last comand on the screen is "will now halt" (sorry 4 my english
[09:40] <lmh> Gh0sty: both are connected
[09:40] <Gh0sty> ah ok :p
[09:40] <Gh0sty> damn :)
[09:40] <Gh0sty> well i had the prob that my first gave: out of sync
[09:40] <Gh0sty> and the second did not show a  thing
[09:40] <RvGaTe> Does ubuntu automaticly detect and setup dual screen?
[09:41] <gbrent> Lam_:
[09:41] <gbrent> gbrent:x:1000:root
[09:41] <Lam_> RvGaTe: I would say no, but i'm not entirely sure
[09:41] <wweasel> ziopeppe: How new is this computer, i.e. does it support automatic shutdown
[09:41] <Gh0sty> i installed newer drivers and did a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:41] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Also run a "df" and show me the result.
[09:41] <wweasel> RvGaTe: No.
[09:41] <Gh0sty> that fixed my probs :/
[09:41] <lmh> Gh0sty: where can i find newer drivers?
[09:41] <c00i90wn> Hey, I'm trying to find the following package without luck "cyrus-sasl", any ideas?
[09:41] <ziopeppe> is an old pc ww
[09:41] <RvGaTe> Lam_, wweasel maybe a suggestion to implement that then :P
[09:41] <Gh0sty> lmh: dont know for your card, mune is nvidia :p
[09:41] <ziopeppe> pentium 3 10 Giga 128 Mb
[09:41] <lmh> Gh0sty: the drivers from the matrox page only work with Xfree86
[09:42] <Gh0sty> installed the real nvidia driver in stead of the reverse engineered nv :/
[09:42] <czer323> TSWoodV, i just realized also, that if i do a network install, i'll need it to recognize the pcmcia bus and the atheros card in it. :-\  It's too old to have a built in ethernet.
[09:42] <lmh> Gh0sty: instead of xorg
[09:42] <gbrent> LAM: from what I see here: gbrent:x:1000:root   that needs to become gbrent:x:1000:root, gbrent     or it needs to become   gbrent:x:1000:gbrent
[09:42] <Gh0sty> ah that sux :/
[09:42] <Gh0sty> no ports of those drivers in backports or something?
[09:42] <lmh> Gh0sty: but the desktop - CD works wonderfully...!
[09:42] <lmh> Gh0sty: no
[09:42] <lmh> Gh0sty: not found
[09:43] <ouroboros> <-- hopeful for help... forums not helping.  uvc video problem.  site says it's supported, uvc compiles and modprobe's fine, but error in dmesg.
[09:43] <TSWoodV> czer323: Look at http://mywheel.net/blog/index.php/ubuntu-network-install/ for a network install of Ubuntu.
[09:43] <Gh0sty> hmm :/
[09:43] <Gh0sty> should be a difference somehow
[09:43] <Richard__> a user was added by mythtv but it doesnt show up in "users and groups"
[09:43] <Richard__> how can I put it there?
[09:43] <NemoXP> hello
[09:43] <NemoXP> some romanians here?
[09:43] <Gh0sty> i had to start the cd also with another resolution ...
[09:43] <Gh0sty> did strange things with my dualscreen
[09:43] <TSWoodV> gbrent: What were you trying to do with these changes you've made?
[09:43] <shwag> Anyone know the procedure for doing a OS replacement on a remote server? Usually I just rsync the whole filesystem over, with the exception of /sys /proc and /dev , then sometime have to generate a new /dev, fix grub, and configure the network interface.
[09:43] <Gh0sty> looked like it recognized both screens as one large screen
[09:44] <Gh0sty> so it put one screen fairly above normal sync rate ...
[09:44] <lmh> Gh0sty: works wonderful with 1600x1200 @ 60Hz (LCD)
[09:44] <Gizmo_the_Great1> this is odd. I have an Ubuntu machine called 'mainunit' with an SMB share called 'vfat'. I have two laptops. Ubuntu on one, Windows on the other. The Windows laptop can access the vfat share. But I can't access it from the Ubuntu laptop. Any ideas?
[09:44] <TSWoodV> Richard__: How did you install mythtv?  All of the installs I've seen lately create the mythtv user.
[09:44] <Richard__> packages
[09:44] <Richard__> a user is created but it wont show up in the users gui tool
[09:44] <gbrent> TSWoodV, Lam_: I figured it out... the admin group looks like this: admin:x:114:  and I need to make it look like this admin:x:114:gbrent
[09:44] <Zaehlas> TSWoodv: sorry, was AFK for a bit, scrolled up, and read your suggestions.  ok.  gimme a sec, and I'll get the outputs of those commands.
[09:45] <NemoXP> witch is the wikipedia channel ??
[09:45] <lmh> Gh0sty: Whom could i ask for help next?
[09:45] <TSWoodV> shwag:  apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade after reconfiguring the repos is a valid technique for upgrading between releases.
[09:45] <TSWoodV> gbrent: That's correct.
[09:45] <gbrent> TSWoodV: I was trying to make me apart of the root group also or something. It was a week ago and I just left it alone for a while
[09:45] <shwag> TSWoodV: how do I upgrade a remote machine from redhat to ubuntu ?
[09:45] <lmh> Gh0sty: or WHERE could i ask if not here?
[09:45] <ziopeppe> anyway 28-wweasel- i don't know if the system support the automatic shut down
[09:46] <ziopeppe> could you help me?
[09:46] <gbrent> TSWoodV: is this action also going to require the recovery console?
[09:46] <mr_daniel> I have installed the 'ipsec-tools' with synatpric. what I have to do to establish a vpn-connection? which commands I have to use and where I can find relevant man-pages ?
[09:46] <gbrent> TSWoodV: can I just boot off a live cd and change it?
[09:46] <lmh> anybody else an idea for my prob?
[09:46] <Alllleexx> Anyone in here have Apple Shake installed?
[09:46] <TSWoodV> gbrent: You weren't far off, if you were running a distro like Fedora.  But for a sudo-based distro that typically doesn't assign a password directly to root, however, the key is the admin group in /etc/sudoers, as you now know.
[09:46] <wweasel> ziopeppe: Can you tell me how old it is/what processor architecture (Pentium 1, Pentium 2, etc.)
[09:46] <rockrhino> mr_daniel what kind of vpn conecntrator are you connecting to?
[09:47] <ziopeppe> ok -wweasel- pentium 3
[09:47] <Sonderblade> how can i install the correct codecs to make totem play wmv?
[09:47] <TSWoodV> gbrent: Yep.  Just mount the / filesystem (if the live distro doesn't do that for you) and fix it.
[09:47] <ziopeppe> p3 10 Gb Hd 128 Mb Ram
[09:47] <TSWoodV> gbrent: Either a Ubuntu Live CD or Knoppix or any other live and/or recovery distro should work.
[09:47] <sgirc> hi all
[09:47] <gbrent> TSWoodV: cool thanks man. Im doing that over lunch when i get home.
[09:47] <lehaid> hi
[09:47] <wweasel> ziopeppe: Hmmm...that's around the time of the switch, though I'd imagine that it should be able to shutdown all by itself
[09:48] <lehaid> i'm wondering, if i want to compile the ubuntu kernel to an image with the same settings the offical one gets, where can i find information on that ?
[09:48] <TSWoodV> gbrent: You're welcome.
[09:48] <mr_daniel> rockrhino: what you mean with 'vpn concentrator'? do you mean the specific gateway I want to connect with?
[09:48] <afflux> any ideas how to get nautilus to automount ntfs drives with ntfs-3g?
[09:48] <lumpki> if i install kubuntu-desktop onto my ubuntu system... will the kubuntu part get security updates and such?
[09:48] <Gizmo_the_Great1> this is odd. I have an Ubuntu machine called 'mainunit' with an SMB share called 'vfat'. I have two laptops. Ubuntu on one, Windows on the other. The Windows laptop can access the vfat share. But I can't access it from the Ubuntu laptop. I have enabled my user account on the linux laptop using smbpasswd -e ted. Any ideas?
[09:48] <sgirc> I have a problem to set up an adsl connection with my edgy
[09:48] <wweasel> ziopeppe: Did you have windows on it before/did it shutdown fine with windows? How about a LiveCD?
[09:48] <Richard__> I only get a dollar sign when I open a terminal (with user mythtv)
[09:48] <ziopeppe> with windows was ok
[09:49] <mr_daniel> rockrhino: the vpn-concentrator is 'fbivpn.informatik.uni-hamburg.de'
[09:49] <Richard__> I would like to be able to scroll through comands with that user :'-(
[09:49] <ziopeppe> i never use liveCd
[09:49] <jjob> I'm having a problem with mplayer plugin in firefox. With some websites it will only allow me to view a video once and then it won't play anyother video on the site untill about an hour has gone by. Any ideas about this?
[09:49] <soundray> Gizmo_the_Great1: I think you need to do the smbpasswd maneouvre on mainunit
[09:49] <lmh> anybody here who knows XORG ?
[09:49] <wweasel> ziopeppe: Alright. If it's not working as a fault of Ubuntu, that's as far as I go. It should have been set up automatically and properly on install, and if it didn't then I'm not really qualified to help you
[09:49] <wweasel> lmh: what in particular?
[09:49] <rockrhino> mr_daniel: I sent you a private message explaining what I meant.
[09:50] <ziopeppe> ok....Thank U 28-wweasel-
[09:50] <Gizmo_the_Great1> soundray: i did that originally i think to enable my windows laptop to connect. so i can't do that again as it's already valid?
[09:50] <sgirc> my ISP is using PPPOA, I ran pppd with debug mode, it seems that my ISP peer doesnt respond to the PPP config request primitive
[09:50] <sgirc> any idea ?
[09:51] <Daviey> how can i downgrade a package?
[09:51] <soundray> Daviey: man dpkg
[09:51] <boink> !downgrade
[09:51] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[09:51] <lmh> wweasel: Ubuntu 6.10 Desktop CD works wonderfully, after installation xorg shows a black screen
[09:51] <boink> ooops
[09:51] <uksprout> hi all
[09:51] <Dreamglider> i need help with wireless connetion pleas, i have ubuntu 6.10
=== sorush_ is now known as grandmaster_S
[09:51] <boink> wireless in 6.10 is broken.
[09:52] <sgirc> I tried to run tcpdump to get a more precise output, but i seem to don't see LLC protocol ?
[09:52] <trappist> boink: huh?
[09:52] <boink> though, I got my working today
[09:52] <Daviey> boink, i only want to downgrade a package, not ubuntu itself
[09:52] <boink> yes, wireless in 6.10 is broken
[09:52] <sgirc> I tried to run tcpdump to get a more precise output, but it seems to don't see LLC protocol ?
[09:52] <soundray> Gizmo_the_Great1: how are you trying to mount the mainunit share on the ubuntu laptop?
[09:52] <Dreamglider> and a X-Micro usb adaper (drivers installed and ok i think)
[09:52] <wweasel> lmh: I
[09:52] <TSWoodV> boink: Try telling that to the three different 6.10 laptops with different chipsets I'm running wireless on.
[09:52] <soundray> Daviey: dpkg has a force-downgrade option
[09:52] <Daviey> soundray, yeah man is great - but i wanted help
[09:52] <wweasel> lmh: I can't help, in that situation I would come here for help. Sorry :P
[09:52] <trappist> boink: I'm sure there are some bugs, but that statement is false.
[09:52] <sgirc> I am using an usb adsl modem
[09:52] <boink> and tell that to me, with a netgear wt511T
[09:52] <sgirc> but I don"t think it matters
[09:52] <boink> that statement isn't false. it's from my own experience.
[09:52] <uksprout> having problems with intermittent sound earlier today the sound was ok I have rebooted and the sound is not working, this has happend a few times over the past few days
[09:52] <jjob> wireless works fine for me on my laptop with 6.10
[09:53] <TSWoodV> boink: Got that exact card running in both a Toshiba and an old Thinkpad.
[09:53] <Gizmo_the_Great1> soundray: places - connect to server or network servers. also tried typing unc path in Nautilus
[09:53] <boink> I had to apt-get some more modules, then I had to reboot
[09:53] <lmh> ANYBODY else who can help with a STRANGE xorg-prob
[09:53] <fearmoth> is it possible to set my computer to use one NIC for web browsing and then use a seperate NIC for downloading with ftp or bittorrent?
[09:53] <boink> and .. it didn't work for me.
[09:53] <sgirc> any PPP guru around here ?
[09:53] <TSWoodV> boink: I love that card.  I don't like the binary blob, but I love the card.  Kismet friendly, it is.
[09:53] <boink> I had to do a lot of googling
[09:53] <trappist> boink: therefore it's broken, I see
[09:53] <boink> yes
[09:53] <stojance> Hi. I need some help with my Webcam. I am using a Philips 200 NC PC Cam which is under the spca5xx and I've had it. The wiki says that it should work out of the box BUT it doesn't. I need human help now!
[09:53] <Gizmo_the_Great1> soundray: it navigates to the vfat folder but then just says its inaccessible and may have moved
[09:53] <boink> with dapper, it works straight away. not with edgy
[09:53] <dand> hello. I have AddDefaultCharset set to Off in /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset, however apache2 always returns "Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" in response
[09:53] <wweasel> boink: plenty of googling is standard when setting up wireless in linux. it's unfortunate, but the case
[09:53] <Daviey> stojance, how have you tested it?
[09:53] <Kaptah> when installing can i tell grub not to write on the MBR ?
[09:53] <dand> is that a security fix of some sorts?
[09:54] <TSWoodV> boink:  No problems here.  What's happening your way?
[09:54] <boink> but not with dapper on the wg511t
[09:54] <Zaehlas> TSWoodv: OK, ran first du without doing sudo, and locked up du, hehe.   anyway, gonna try it again, but first my df result is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34409/
[09:54] <sgirc> I can send debug output is someone is interested
[09:54] <stojance> Daviey: Ekiga (a.k.a Gnome meeting)
[09:54] <TSWoodV> boink:  Yes - dapper on an older Toshiba (1.7 GHz) with the 511T.
[09:54] <Dreamglider> no one able to assist me !
[09:54] <Daviey> stojance, i found VLC great for testing.  Have you tried accessing the camera as root/sudo?
[09:55] <boink> thus, wireless on edgy is causing a lot of problems for people.
[09:55] <soundray> Gizmo_the_Great1: I don't know the solution to that
[09:55] <stojance> Daviey: How?
[09:55] <lehaid> i'm wondering, if i want to compile the ubuntu kernel to an image with the same settings the offical one gets, where can i find information on that ?
[09:55] <_david_> Hi, I need help multibooting an iMac core duo
[09:55] <soundray> !kernelcompile | lehaid
[09:55] <ubotu> lehaid: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[09:55] <_david_> is this the place, or should I go to a different channel?
[09:55] <||arifaX> boink: problem is too much ways to do it. this is really what should be changed very fast to make ubuntu more userfriendly
[09:55] <hilde> does anybody know if wireless keybourd & mouse works with ubuntu?
[09:55] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: You've got one large partition, period.  You really should have at least a separate partition for /boot.  But that's not the problem here.
[09:56] <lehaid> soundray: thanks !
[09:56] <||arifaX> hilde: if the sender is usb should work without problems
[09:56] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Let's see what "du -sk" tells us.
[09:56] <soundray> hilde: they generally do
[09:56] <gbrent> hilde: your going to have to try it... most of them should
[09:56] <carlosqueso> lehaid, IIRC you can get the base ubuntu settings by typing make oldconfig before you start messing with the settings
[09:56] <Daviey> stojance, open up the terminal and run sudo Ekiga
[09:56] <killown> how I do automatic login gdm?
[09:56] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: ok, about to run it now.
[09:56] <gbrent> hilde: You may have to map sopme of your buttons with the xmodmap command
[09:56] <TSWoodV> hilde: I've used several different wireless keyboards and mice with edgy just fine.
[09:56] <lehaid> carlosqueso: you need to copy them from somewhere before..
[09:56] <soundray> killown: configure via System-Administration-Login Window
[09:57] <_david_> does anyone here know about multibooting intel macintoshes, or i where I could find someone who does know...?
[09:57] <hilde> TSWoodV, the logitech's
[09:57] <lullabud> anybody here have experience with EVDO cards in ubuntu?
[09:57] <Alllleexx> This might sound dumb, but do u need an anti virus program for ubuntu?
[09:57] <stojance> Daviey: No device found.
[09:57] <hilde> this one I'm want to buy? http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/BE/EN,CRID=2162,CONTENTID=10850
[09:57] <carlosqueso> lehaid....I never had to, just installed linux-sources, untarred them and went
[09:57] <||arifaX> Alllleexx: If you are such a user that needs one under windows probably yes
[09:57] <TSWoodV> hilde: Should be good.  Try looking under System->Preferences->Keyboard and see if that keyboard is listed there.  If not, there's still hope.
[09:58] <Vigor> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear
[09:58] <saxin> anyone that can suggest a program that can take a screen of an area I mark on the desktop in ubuntu? :)
[09:58] <Daviey> stojance, have you tried both /dev/video0 and /dev/video1
[09:58] <hilde> ok so I can buy it.
[09:58] <killown> soundray what?
[09:58] <TSWoodV> Alllleexx: Not for Ubuntu's sake, but if you exchange a lot of files with Windows users, you might find one convenient as to not become a virus passer.
[09:58] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: bah.  all my terminal commands now are locking up without finishing.   since that first du, afte3r I killed that process, the DF gave me a result, but never "finished, and no du's since then have finished.  I should prolly reboot at this point, or rescan my process list.
[09:58] <||arifaX> saxin: wink http://www.debugmode.com/wink/download.php
[09:58] <stojance> Daviey: No. But Ekiga should detect them both.
[09:58] <TSWoodV> Alllleexx: I don't bother, however, as I expect to get clean stuff from the Windows users to begin with.
[09:58] <soundray> killown: are you on ubuntu?
[09:58] <Skwid_> hum, i tried using a symlink to share my data files between windows and linux (link in linux to fat32 windows files), and when i run phpmyadmin under linux, it sees the good tables, but when I try to display them, I get the following error:
[09:58] <Skwid_>  #1033 - Incorrect information in file: './pragmapic_development/layers.frm'
[09:58] <Vigor> Who asked about wireless?
[09:59] <killown> soundray, yes
[09:59] <||arifaX> saxin: what when you press the print-screen button? :)
[09:59] <uksprout> can anyone offer help : sound problem . sound card is Soundblaster live OS: ubuntu 6.10 probem: sometimes I have sound sometimes I don't
[09:59] <Daviey> stojance, download something like 'vlc' and try that.  Then you know what settings/permissions
[09:59] <soundray> killown: Gnome as well?
[09:59] <killown> soundray, yes
[09:59] <Daviey> Does anybody use a SIP client that supports webcam?
[09:59] <lullabud> Vigor:  I asked about EVDO, if that's what you mean.
[09:59] <soundray> killown: then open your eyes and follow my instruction.
[10:00] <killown> certo!
[10:00] <lonran> how do u print a pdf using both sides?
[10:00] <saxin> if I push the print-screen, It take picture of the whole screen :)
[10:00] <saxin> I dont want that
[10:00] <Vigor> lullabud: I have NO idea what that is, but this page is about wireless...http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear
[10:00] <Skwid_> any suggestions ?
[10:01] <Duesentrieb> saxin: KSnapshot gives you the option to "shoot" only individual windows...
[10:01] <Duesentrieb> i guess must screenshot progs do nowadays.
[10:01] <JurB> lonran: i think kpdf can do that
[10:01] <Duesentrieb> or are you talking about windows?
[10:01] <hilde> thanxs
[10:01] <nicoAMG> SOS!!!
[10:01] <stojance> Daviey: Any other alternative.
[10:02] <Vigor> And whomever asked about AV, yes, if a machine is connected to todays Internet, I suggest at the least, a Boot Sector AV.
[10:02] <lullabud> Vigor:  yeah, that's not the same technology.  this is using cell phone signals.  thanks though.
[10:02] <nicoAMG> I cant install Ubuntu 6.10 due to mirror problems
[10:02] <Daviey> stojance, Use any you want, but i highly recommend VLC
[10:02] <nicoAMG> What can i do?
[10:02] <saxin> Duesentrieb: well.. is it a KDE-app?
[10:02] <Vigor> lullabud: I have my ticket. :-P
[10:03] <stojance> Daviey: Why VLC? What can you do with VLC?
[10:03] <mr_daniel> rockrhino: where is the private message?
[10:03] <carlosqueso> nicoAMG, have you tried using a different mirror? and are you upgrading or downloading a CD
[10:03] <Duesentrieb> saxin: yes. i imagine the gnome-equivalent does the same thing.
[10:03] <lullabud> stojance:  vlc is the swiss army knife for a/v.
[10:03] <Duesentrieb> if not... well, gnome just sucks :P
[10:03] <lullabud> stojance:  i don't use it in linux, but i can say it's the best player for windows and os x.
[10:03] <saxin> Duesentrieb: I see.. you don't have name on any gnome-equivalent? :P
[10:04] <lullabud> stojance:  plus it's available for everything.  you could probably install it on a clock radio.
[10:04] <Daviey> stojance, as i said.. use any you like.  VLC is a media player.  Also allows you to play capture devices (webcams).  Also ease of tweaking
[10:04] <Duesentrieb> lullabud, stojance: alternatives are xine (with kaffeine or totem frontends) and (k|g)mplayer
[10:04] <Vigor> VLC is a Latent Connection dohickey?
[10:04] <lonran> JurB, thnks, kpdf works
[10:04] <Duesentrieb> saxin: no - i would expect it to pop up when you press the print button. that's how it works under kde at least.
[10:05] <nicoAMG> carlosqueso: The problem is installing Ubuntu on a computer. And seems related to repository problems
[10:05] <JurB> lonran: no prob
[10:05] <Richard__> bahhh
[10:05] <nicoAMG> carlosqueso:
[10:05] <lullabud> anybody else have any experience with EVDO cards in ubuntu?
[10:05] <stojance> Can Totem capture from Webcams, or Pitivi?
[10:05] <Richard__> I'm trying to add a user via the gui tools but it dissapears as soon as I close it
[10:06] <Duesentrieb> Richard__: use adduser from the command line :)
[10:06] <Zaehlas> What is the command again to touch a system flag?  I know it's touch (path I can't remember)/forcefsck to force a fsck run at reboot, but can't rememebr the path.
[10:07] <frying_fish> anyone had much experience with external monitors, doing 1920x1200 and the i915 graphics chipset (using i810 driver)
[10:07] <Daviey> I want to install a feisty package (linphone) on edgy, but it has dependencies such as libc6 (next sub version).  I'm certain that it would would with edgy's packages... but how do i force it?
[10:07] <lullabud> Zaehlas:  `fsck --help`
[10:07] <||arifaX> frying_fish: only tip I have is install package 915resolution if you haven't already
[10:07] <stojance> I dont have any video0 or 1 in /dev
[10:07] <Daviey> stojance, Why won't you use VLC!?!?
[10:07] <Zaehlas> lullabud: Thanks
[10:07] <soundray> Daviey: apt-build it
[10:08] <lullabud> Zaehlas:  er, `reboot --help`
[10:08] <frying_fish> ||arifaX: already have, but that still hasn't helped. I can get 1280x1024 out on the external panel, and its 1280x800 on the internal panel
[10:08] <iam8up|lpy> i've made some changes to my /etc/bash.bashrc file and yet when i source the file none of the changes take effect, am i doing something wrong?
[10:08] <JosefK> anyone managed to get Neverwinter NIghts to run on 6.10?  I keep getting a segfault :/
[10:08] <Daviey> soundray, apt-build?
[10:09] <lullabud> Zaehlas:  d'oh, none of those had it, actually... =/  it's `shutdown -F ..etc..`
[10:09] <stojance> Daviey: I cant, If I had the download I've downloaded it. It's like 11 MB
[10:09] <Zaehlas> lullabud: LOL,  I was running that right there with you, hehe.
[10:09] <stojance> I can but It'll take forever
[10:09] <lullabud> Zaehlas:  weird too is that it wasn't in apropos.
[10:10] <stojance> I'm like 7000 B/s
[10:10] <Daviey> stojance, OIC - your on dialup
[10:10] <soundray> Daviey: you don't like being pointed to manpages, so I won't
[10:10] <nicoAMG> My Ubuntu setup is halted due to:  Connection failed  Err http://cr.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/restricted translation-es
[10:10] <||arifaX> iam8up|lpy: did you check also ~/.bashrc and for the sudo stuff /root/.bashrc
[10:10] <Daviey> soundray, haha
[10:10] <stojance> Daviey: I'm not on DIALUP!
[10:10] <lehaid> ubuntu gives me currently only 640x480 and 800x600 resolutions on the gnome change resolution, how can i add 1024x768 ? (running on vmware)
[10:10] <iam8up|lpy> ||arifaX - yes
[10:10] <nicoAMG> What can i do to complete my setup?
[10:11] <stojance> Daviey: I'm on DSL 100 Mbps but it has fallen down cause I've spent all my download
[10:11] <iam8up|lpy> ahh found my problem - bad comment on the original PS1
[10:11] <||arifaX> iam8up|lpy: I only changed my user settings and that worked
[10:11] <lullabud> lehaid:  edit the xorg.conf and add the resolution in the lines where you see 800x600
[10:11] <lehaid> lullabud: did it, didn't change anything
[10:11] <lullabud> lehaid:  did you restart x?
[10:11] <lullabud> lehaid:  i had that same problem and i fixed it that way./
[10:11] <Zaehlas> lullabud OK, I see that option in shutdown now, although someoen the other day gave a way to use touch command on a file named forcefsck, and it's supposed to set the flag for the hard drive that also forces an fsck, just couldn't remember the proper path to the file.   shutdown prolly does the same thing, with the -F flag, hehe
[10:11] <kudzubane> lehaid: under vmware ws, you need to run vmware-config to change res
[10:11] <lehaid> lullabud: yes i restarted
[10:11] <lehaid> kudzubane: ok, thanks
[10:11] <Daviey> stojance, 'lsusb' will tell you what is connected to USB.  See if it shows up
[10:11] <iam8up|lpy> eww...i have a set PS1 statement to change my prompt and on ubuntu it make smy typing go to th eline above it - on my two centos boxes it works just fine...
[10:11] <lehaid> i'll try it
[10:12] <frederific> lehaid, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[10:12] <lehaid> kudzubane: where is the vmware-config settings saved ? i wanna back it up
[10:12] <lullabud> lehaid:  neat.  looks like you can just `touch /forcefsck` and it'll do it.
[10:12] <lehaid> frederific: i was hoping without having ot run that, and reconfigure all
[10:12] <mr_daniel> I am really confused 8-|  I have installed the package 'ipsec-tools'. How I can establish a vpn-connection to the gateway (or vpn-concentrator) fbivpn.informatik.uni-hamburg.de ?
[10:12] <lehaid> lullabud: do what ?
[10:12] <lullabud> lehaid:  that was in `man shutdown`
[10:12] <mr_daniel> which commands I have to use?
[10:12] <eloque> anybody here ran ubuntu as a virtual machine from windows? (being that i have ubuntu installed on a local partition and dont wanna run it as a live cd)
[10:12] <visik7> having few linuxisms means have a poor integration with the kernel I don't consider it a feature
[10:12] <kudzubane> lehaid: dunno, google it and all will be known
[10:12] <frederific> lehaid: ignore what i said then , thi slot knows more :)
[10:12] <lehaid> kudzubane: k
[10:12] <x-fak> pls tell me if it's normal that when idling the process Xorg take from 10 to 40% of time (lol) in VMWARE
[10:13] <kudzubane> lehaid: make sure you have vmware-tools installed also
[10:13] <lehaid> lullabud: what will touch /orcefsck do ?
[10:13] <lehaid> kudzubane: i do, my mouse moves seemigly
[10:13] <mr_daniel> do anyone know a good HOWTO for ipsec-tools + ubuntu?
[10:13] <brianski> anyone know of a fast ubuntu iso mirror on the east coast of the US? i'm getting like 30kb/s
[10:13] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: If you're still around, gonna reboot, to try and run the du command again, proprly, my terminal sessions aren't working correctly at the moment, orat least some commands aren't.  anyway, I'll be right back.
[10:13] <kudzubane> lehaid: great, then you are all set for the res change
[10:13] <lullabud> lehaid:  `touch /forcefsck` creates the file "/forcefsck" which tells linux to run fsck on reboot.
[10:13] <stojance> Daviey: Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0471:0325 Philips
[10:13] <stojance> It does
[10:13] <lehaid> lullabud: why would i want to do that?!?
[10:13] <eloque> i amtrying to configur the modem on my laptop (HP dv8000t) but it is not recognizing any devices... the built in modem is a conexant
[10:13] <lullabud> lehaid:  weren't you just asking about running fsck on reboot??
[10:13] <lehaid> nop
[10:13] <Vigor> Has anyone tried EasyUbuntu? and does it work?
[10:14] <lullabud> lehaid:  oops!  hahah, i got my convo's mixed up
[10:14] <mr_daniel> Vigor: yeah, it works
[10:14] <lullabud> LOL
[10:14] <Vigor> Thank you
[10:14] <basilio> i tried easyubuntu but i cant get it to open
=== SteveC is now known as ssssss
[10:14] <basilio> its downloaded and installed the package but wont open
[10:14] <x-fak> pls tell me if it's normal that when idling the process Xorg take from 10 to 40% of time (lol) in VMWARE
[10:14] <x-fak> plz
[10:15] <mr_daniel> bachler: what's the error-message?
[10:15] <mr_daniel> bachler: ups
[10:15] <mr_daniel> basilio: what's the error-message?
[10:15] <Vigor> I am gonna give it a shot, brb
[10:15] <basilio> no error message
[10:15] <basilio> just flickers on screen but never comes up
[10:15] <Teltariat> Greets folks
[10:15] <mr_daniel> basilio: start easyubuntu in a new console
[10:15] <Teltariat> Quick question
[10:15] <Vigor> basilo: Did you get it from Synaptic?
[10:15] <Teltariat> How do you have Ubuntu auto-login?
[10:15] <mr_daniel> basilio: than you probably get some error-messages
[10:16] <mr_daniel> Teltariat: what do you mean with 'auto-login'
[10:16] <basilio> i just tried it again i click on it it asks for my root password then the screen flickers but nothing comes up
[10:17] <mr_daniel> basilio: dont' use the 'icon' to open it
[10:17] <basilio> ok
[10:17] <x-fak> is it normal that alien (for installing .rpm package) is so slow ?
[10:17] <mr_daniel> basilio: open a new conole and than tip 'sudo easyubuntu'
[10:17] <||arifaX> x-fak: it re-creates the rpm as a .deb so that is what takes time
[10:17] <mr_daniel> x-fak: this is normal
[10:17] <basilio> the same thing happened but the terminal says:
[10:18] <basilio> 'Unable to determine desktop environment, falling back to gksudo
[10:18] <mr_daniel> basilio: this is a starting-point to solve the problem
[10:18] <philc> what's the program to configure x?
[10:18] <Teltariat> mr_daniel: I mean that you don't get prompted for username and password, and that on startup, Ubuntu auto-logs in and goes straight to desktop
[10:18] <Teltariat> No gdm
[10:19] <Teltariat> Or xdm
[10:19] <x-fak> ok arifix and mr_daniel
[10:19] <Teltariat> or whatever greeter that is
[10:19] <mr_daniel> basilio: maybe you get much more information about the error when you try a 'sudo easyubuntu -v', but I am not sure if this works
[10:19] <basilio> ok im going to try it
[10:19] <x-fak> someone using ubuntu from a vmware VM ?
[10:19] <mr_daniel> basilio: now you can google with the error message
[10:19] <edan> how can i open a rpm file?
[10:20] <mr_daniel> basilio: you will probably find somethink usefull
[10:20] <aboutblank> i'm extremely confused with my network issues. my ubuntu box is using a static IP (tried DHCP too), and it can ping my windows box (which i'm on right now), but not the router or anything outside my network. it does, however, do the dns resolution. for example, it will get the correct ip of google.com, but no packets return. i'm extremely perplexed as to why it can't ping my router by IP.
[10:20] <hutchy> hi. i want to unload all unused modules. i could do it using rmmod but that's a pain. how should i approach it ?
[10:20] <NoUse> !rpm | edan
[10:20] <ubotu> edan: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
[10:20] <basilio> this is the error im getting now i guess im missing a file: python: can't open file './easyubuntu.in': [Errno 2]  No such file or directory
[10:20] <lullabud> lehaid:  if it's not working still, paste your xorg.conf into a pastebin and let me take a look.
[10:21] <||arifaX> aboutblank: check your routes
[10:21] <edan> ok tnx
[10:21] <steveire> Hey, I'm trying to run a script whenever I connect to the internet. I have a test script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/ but it doesn't seem to be run when I connect.
[10:21] <x-fak> who is the guy using ubuntu in vmware?
[10:21] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, sorry, but do you mean traceroute?
[10:21] <mr_daniel> Teltariat: this is possible under Xfce with the tool 'rungetty', but I am now sure if this also works with (k)ubuntu
[10:21] <lullabud> x-fak:  i am, and lehaid is.
[10:21] <lehaid> lullabud: i'll try it soon
[10:21] <x-fak> ok
[10:21] <soundray> steveire: make sure it's executable (sudo chmod +x  /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/scriptname')
[10:21] <x-fak> some questions for you guys
[10:21] <hutchy> how to unload unused modules ?
[10:21] <||arifaX> aboutblank: type 'netstat -r' in a shell
[10:21] <lehaid> i am using currently the virtual ubuntu applience from VMWARE's site
[10:22] <steveire> soundray: Yes, it's executable. I can run it fine as ./scriptname while in the directory.
[10:22] <x-fak> do you have to launch vmware-toolbox before beeing able to copy/paste text from vm to host?
[10:22] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: is you dns-config ok? do you have a file /etc/resolv.conf?
[10:22] <lullabud> x-fak:  if you could address me as i'm addressing you it'd be easier for me to see your messages in the chat window.
[10:22] <x-fak> lullabud> ok
[10:22] <lullabud> x-fak:  huh, i've never tried that actually.
[10:22] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, thank you for helping me. i cannot pastebin the output easily. what information is important
[10:22] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: are you using wlan?
[10:23] <lehaid> x-fak: doesnt work here, didnt try it yet
[10:23] <||arifaX> aboutblank: do you have a line starting with "default"
[10:23] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: yes i have an /etc/resolv.conf, and i'm not sure what wlan is.
[10:23] <mr_daniel> basilio: python is a programing-language, and I think it is a interpreter-like language also
[10:23] <x-fak> lehaid and lullabud i have to laucn the gui app vmware-toolbox to copy text from a console, TO the host OS
[10:23] <x-fak> which is a win xp
[10:23] <eloque> Anybody know a way to get around paying for drivers for my Conexant built in modem?
[10:23] <mr_daniel> basilio: this mean, that you need to install a phyton-interpreter
[10:24] <soundray> steveire: try putting it in /etc/network/if-up.d instead
[10:24] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, I do have a line starting with "default". the gateway is "192.168.0.1" and the genmask is "0.0.0.0"
[10:24] <mr_daniel> basilio: search under synaptic for it, maybe this will help you to run easyubuntu, but I am now sure
[10:24] <frederific> Ive just noticed, the default 2nd away message in Xchat is "This debian user is away" shouldn't that be ubuntu?
[10:24] <basilio> ok thanks
[10:25] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: with wlan i mean wireless-lan, do you now understand me?
[10:25] <||arifaX> aboutblank: thats okay if 192.168.0.1 is the ip of your router
[10:25] <gbrent> join #php
[10:25] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, yes, it is the ip of my router.
[10:25] <aboutblank> mr_daniel, no, i'm on a wired lan.
[10:25] <steveire> thanks soundray. I'll give it a shot now.
[10:25] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: check your /etc/network/interfaces
[10:25] <shinux> Hi!
[10:26] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: maybe there are missing some important informations
[10:26] <||arifaX> aboutblank: there should be another line starting with 192.168.0.0 what about that?
[10:26] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: If you're still around, I got the results, and pasted them, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34411/

[10:29] <|Aymnmz|> Kim^J: Are you here ?

[10:29] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: ok, your config tells me, that you are NOT using DHCP
[10:29] <Kim^J> graham_100_: The problem is?
[10:29] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: but is your router 'using' DHCP?
[10:29] <Kim^J> |Aymnmz|: I'm here.
[10:29] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: check the router-config

[10:30] <runespy> Hello, i have a really big question, my question, as i said is long, has first a story, i installed
[10:30] <runespy> ubuntu on a 100GB Harddrive with windows XP Pro on a dual boot, as i accidently messed up that
[10:30] <runespy> installation somehow, so i had found another 100 GB Harddrive and installed it on there as that one
[10:30] <runespy> as master, and the one with the messed up ubuntu and Win XP As slave, now what i want to do is
[10:30] <runespy> get rid of Ubuntu on the second 100GB and then get rid of the one on the other 100GB so that its just
[10:30] <runespy> Windows XP, but here is another problem, even though its 100GB windows XP is only reading about 21 or 25 GB
[10:30] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: that is correct, and it has worked for the past 5 months, i believe when i updated it yesterday it broke.
[10:30] <runespy> of it, how can i restore that partition to be the main one on that harddrive and for it to be master operating system to boot.
[10:30] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Give me all info that you think I would need to help you.
[10:30] <runespy> If you can get me an awnser to this, thank you...
[10:30] <aboutblank> jesus
[10:30] <lehaid> runespy: WTF ?!?!?!?! PASTEBINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
[10:30] <x-fak> lol lehaid , ok so i think i have not enough memory :)
[10:30] <lehaid> x-fak: 2GB of memory is cheap
[10:30] <ParaMouth> Hows everyone today?
[10:30] <LjL> Ubotu, tell runespy about paste | runespy, see the private message from Ubotu
[10:30] <x-fak> how cheap? :)

[10:30] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[10:30] <jaek> anyone know how to make my volume buttons on my keyboard adjust the PCM instead of Master?
[10:30] <graham_100_> kim^j my first problem is with getting second hard drive to work properly
[10:31] <mr_daniel> runespy: I don't understand your problem, can you repeat it with other words?
[10:31] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What's the problem with it?
[10:31] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: hmm, where the problem can be?
[10:31] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, mr_daniel, is there a way to rollback updates applied? i do believe that is what broke my connection, since i'm sure it was working before that.
[10:31] <aboutblank> or at least a log of updates applied?
[10:31] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: in synaptic you can find a install-log
[10:31] <|Aymnmz|> Kim^J: I hope that may help you...
[10:31] <||arifaX> aboutblank: try with a default /etc/network/interfaces file first
[10:32] <LjL> !caps | lehaid, for that matter
[10:32] <ubotu> lehaid, for that matter: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[10:32] <graham_100_> kim^j well i have got the partition manager and the disks programme, i have tried to format it and re partition but i cannot save things to it or creat folders in it
[10:32] <Kim^J> |Aymnmz|: Thanks alot. :D
[10:32] <aboutblank> ||arifaX, by default you mean DHCP?
[10:32] <graham_100_> kim^j
[10:32] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: are you using the commands 'ifdown' and 'ifup' ?
[10:32] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Does it mount?
[10:32] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: No.
[10:32] <mr_daniel> ||arifaX: what you mean with default

[10:32] <|Aymnmz|> bye bye, I go back to #ubuntu-fr...
[10:32] <aboutblank> though ifconfig reports eth0 up.
[10:32] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: ok than
[10:32] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: open a new conole and
[10:33] <lullabud> LjL:  is there an ubotu command that talks about addressing the person you're chatting to?
[10:33] <graham_100_> kim^j unable to mount the selected programme it says
[10:33] <LjL> !usernames | lullabud

[10:33] <lullabud> LjL:  exellent
[10:33] <Kim^J> graham_100_: programme = drive ?
[10:33] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: try a 'sudo ifdown -a' and than a 'sudo ifup ethX'
[10:33] <graham_100_> kim^j yes
[10:33] <lullabud> excellent even...
[10:33] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: and X is the specific number of your lan-card
[10:33] <eloque> bah cant get an answer no matter how many times i ask
[10:33] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: maybe eth0 or eth1

[10:33] <eloque> BAH humbug
[10:34] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: okay.. i'm actually VNCing to the machine (ironic..., only machine it can connect to it seems), i'm going to put it in a batch file.
[10:34] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: it is eth0
[10:34] <graham_100_> kim^j unable to mount the selected volume
[10:34] <||arifaX> aboutblank: I have no default one but maybe someone can post a default 'interfaces' file for you
[10:34] <PMantis> Can anyone name a GUI network auto-config tool similar to Network-Manager ?
[10:34] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What's the /dev/XdZY to the drive?
[10:34] <lullabud> eloque:  what's the question?
[10:34] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: hmm, this can't be, because DHCP have to manage this, but
[10:34] <graham_100_> kim^j how do i find that out?
[10:34] <||arifaX> PMantis: wlan or lan
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[10:34] <Kim^J> Where X is either h or s and Z is a-z and Y is 1 to 99.

[10:35] <eloque> i amtrying to configur the modem on my laptop (HP dv8000t) but it is not recognizing any devices... the built in modem is a conexant
[10:35] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: maybe you have to check your ip-range
[10:35] <PMantis> ||arifaX, Both... laptop needs to migrate from network to network... (I saw another option in synaptic recently... can't locate it now)
[10:35] <graham_100_> kim^j errm don't get you sorry
[10:35] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: i have windows based machines that are doing static IPs just fine.
[10:35] <lullabud> eloque:  ah, a winmodem...  that sucks.  what's the model number of the modem, or the model of the chip it uses?
[10:35] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Is it a SATA/SCSI or a PATA/IDE drive?
[10:35] <||arifaX> PMantis: I use kwlan for my wireless and guessnet/ifplugd/resolvconf for my lan
[10:36] <mr_daniel> eloque: maybe you need this driver here http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/hsf/full/downloads-ubuntu-x86.php
[10:36] <graham_100_> kim^j IDE drive sorry
[10:36] <eloque> how can i find that out?
[10:36] <eloque> it isn't in a card so i cant really take it out and peep it
[10:36] <||arifaX> PMantis: oh you are on gnome?
[10:36] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: hmm, are you using DHCP or staitc?
[10:36] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: i just did an ifdown -a, ifup eth0, and ifconfig now only reports eth0 up (no lo) and still no pinging action
[10:36] <graham_100_> kim^j I have 2 IDE drives one is working fine obviously i am running linux on it lol
[10:36] <PMantis> ||arifaX, yes
[10:36] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: what the windows machines are using, DHCP or static?
[10:36] <Kim^J> graham_100_: hdX then. Is it master on the first channel or slave? Or maybe on the secoand channel.
[10:36] <tonyyarusso> How can I change the user, group, and permissions used by default when creating new directories and files under a directory?
[10:36] <graham_100_> kim^j it's slave
[10:37] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: on the network i have windows machines doing DHCP and static, and this troubled machine cannot do either.
[10:37] <eloque> being that i cna only use dial up internet right now... i'm pretty screwed if the modem doesn't work
[10:37] <graham_100_> kim^j the other drive is master on the same IDE cable
[10:37] <Kim^J> graham_100_: On wich channel? The first or the second?
[10:37] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Ok.
[10:37] <||arifaX> PMantis: I also tried network-manager but I hate using dhcp all the time so I chose guessnet for lan
[10:37] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: I am not sure, but could it be that your lan-card is broken?
[10:37] <graham_100_> kim^j I don't know how to tell which channel that is
[10:37] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Can you do this: "df -h" in a shell without the " ?
[10:38] <Kim^J> graham_100_: And the tell me where / is mounted.
[10:38] <highneko> How can I list all available commands?
[10:38] <aboutblank> lol mr_daniel, i'm connected the troubled box through VNC over the router which it cannot ping!
[10:38] <mr_daniel> tonyyarusso: you can use the command 'chown' to set the owner of a file
[10:38] <lullabud> eloque:  what might be easier than configuring your winmodem is getting an external modem, or getting a gateway that has a modem built in.
[10:38] <Kim^J> highneko: Press tab a few times.
[10:38] <graham_100_> kim^j what's a shell (sorry i am still learning this)
[10:38] <lullabud> highneko:  hit tab at a terminal.
[10:38] <highneko> aboutblankz; router firewall?
[10:38] <eloque> i have a linksys router/AP
[10:38] <eloque> any good?
[10:38] <aboutblank> highneko: nope. all internal...
[10:38] <tonyyarusso> mr_daniel: But how can I make it so I don't have to do that after the fact?
[10:38] <lullabud> highneko:  another good way is `apropos something`
[10:38] <tonyyarusso> mr_daniel: I need everything created or copied into /var/www/ to have a group of www-data and readable by all
[10:38] <highneko> lullabud: Ok, thank you. Works good.
[10:39] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Oh. Do you know howto open the Terminal, Konsole, Xterm, whater-you-call-it ?
[10:39] <mr_daniel> aboutblank: this is really interesting
[10:39] <lullabud> eloque:  well, if you have a linksys router and it's not connecting to broadband it's not doing you much good, unless it has a built in modem.
[10:39] <aboutblank> mr_daniel: interesting? hah! more like confusing...
[10:39] <graham_100_> kim^j yes i learned that quickly
[10:39] <graham_100_> lol
[10:39] <Kim^J> graham_100_: That's a shell.
[10:39] <graham_100_> kim^j ok
[10:39] <eloque> i am in saudi arabia right now .... dsl here sucks but i applied months ago
[10:39] <lullabud> anybody have experience with EVDO cards in ubuntu, or linux at all for that matter?
[10:39] <mr_daniel> tonyyarusso: you can also change the owner of EVERY file in a directory, you just have to use a '*'
[10:39] <Kim^J> Write df -h in the shell and give me the output of where / is mounted.
[10:40] <graham_100_> kim^j so what do i type in terminal?
[10:40] <eloque> am on a waiting list the fact that i have a router has nothing to do with my ability to use high speed internet... at least thats how things are here
[10:40] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Read the above.
[10:40] <Zaehlas> Well, TSWoodV was helping me earlier, but is probably extended AFK now.  I'm still having a filesystem problem of 36 gigs being allocated that is not represented by files I can find.  The trash bin is empty, and fsck on reboot does not fix it.  My current information is located at http://www.ultralarp.com/DiskUsage.gif and  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34411/
[10:40] <eloque> trying to make th ebest of it
[10:40] <tonyyarusso> mr_daniel: I know how to change things that already exist; I need to do it preemtively.
[10:40] <mr_daniel> tonyyarusso: try a 'chown OWNER *', BUT be careful with this commend
[10:40] <lullabud> eloque:  if you can get an airport base station, or an actiontec R7000M you'd be alright.
[10:40] <eloque> these are external laptops... or?
[10:40] <mr_daniel> tonyyarusso: I don't know how to handle this, maybe you have to create a script for this
[10:41] <lullabud> eloque:  dial-on-demand 56k gateways.
[10:41] <eloque> i mean modems
[10:41] <eloque> lol external laptops
[10:41] <eloque> external modems i mea
[10:41] <eloque> lol
[10:41] <tonyyarusso> mr_daniel: That may work.  Thanks anyway.
[10:41] <eloque> ok
[10:41] <graham_100_> kim^j what do you want me to tell you i have lots of writing
[10:41] <Kim^J> graham_100_: df -h and where is / mounted on
[10:41] <lullabud> eloque:  sort of.  but better.  you plug in with ethernet and they function just like a normal router, but you can hook them to a phone line for dial-up.
[10:41] <eloque> any idea about how much one of them might run?
[10:41] <mr_daniel> why not kubuntu 6.10?
[10:41] <phoenix87ta> any way to get Totem to play wmvs?
[10:41] <graham_100_> kim^j it says mounted on /
[10:41] <lullabud> eloque:  you could get the actiontec one on the cheap.  google for hactiontec.
[10:42] <lullabud> eloque:  the airport's are like $200.
[10:42] <graham_100_> kim^j filesystem /dev/hdal
[10:42] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Ah thanks.
[10:42] <Kim^J> /dev/hda1 it is.
[10:42] <eloque> DAMN!
[10:42] <mr_daniel> eloque: you have to check your kernel-verison with a 'uname -r' to download the right driver-file
[10:42] <eloque> i hope that broadband comes quick
[10:42] <graham_100_> kim^j that is my primary hard drive though
[10:42] <lullabud> eloque:  you actually might be better off with the hactiontec one, since the apple one doesn't have a web-gui.
[10:42] <sgirc> hi does anybody know how to bind a ppp connection to a specific interface, I want to bind it to nas0, not ppp0
[10:42] <lullabud> eloque:  well, even if you got the apple one it would still fuction as an ethernet gateway for cable or dsl, and a wireless access point.
[10:43] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Yep. That I wanted to know. Can you do this: ls /dev | grep hdb ?
[10:43] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: you mean .wmv, or?
[10:43] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: I thing you need the package 'w32codecs' for this
[10:43] <phoenix87ta> mr_daniel, yes, .wmv.  it's playing just about everything else, I got all the gstreamer codecs
[10:43] <zi99y>  /join #ubuntu-classroom
[10:43] <phoenix87ta> mr_daniel, I tried that one.  didn't do anything
[10:44] <graham_100_> kim^j says "hdbl"
[10:44] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: gstreamer isn't able to handle .wmv-files
[10:44] <phoenix87ta> yeah, noticed that
[10:44] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Nothing more?
[10:44] <graham_100_> kim^j nope
[10:44] <x-fak> how i can i know i got ALL the last updates for ubuntu, also for the OS himself?
[10:44] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Ok
[10:44] <sgirc> anybody thaht has used pppoa ?
[10:44] <graham_100_> kim^j be right back have to do something
[10:44] <eloque> so if i use ethernet do i really have much to worry about?
[10:44] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Do this: sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
=== fuu is now known as draco
[10:44] <eloque> also does WAN work decently right out the box on a normal ubuntu install?
[10:45] <Vigor> This easy Ubuntu thing is also Automatix, or has a link to it, is this thing supported or is it a crash and burn?
[10:45] <phoenix87ta> mr_daniel, okay, is there another WMV player at all that's worth a damn?
[10:45] <LjL> !automatix | Vigor
[10:45] <ubotu> Vigor: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[10:45] <LjL> !easyubuntu | Vigor
[10:45] <ubotu> Vigor: easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ - For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[10:45] <[Gino] > How do you turn off auto complete in OO.o?
[10:45] <Vigor> Thank you
[10:46] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: I am not sure, but VLC (or VCL, video lan) is a very good player, it uses the packege FFmpeg, maybe you need this to play .wmv-files
[10:46] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: or
[10:46] <eloque> VLC
[10:46] <eloque> videlan.org
[10:46] <eloque> Videolan.org *
[10:46] <mr_daniel> phoenix87ta: you can use automatix or easyubuntu
[10:46] <phoenix87ta> yeah, that one works, but the app itself is a little too powerful for my system
[10:46] <sgirc> i really need help !
[10:46] <mr_daniel> sgirc: just ask, what is your problem :)
[10:47] <lehaid> which package in ubuntu has the file "stdio.h" ?
[10:47] <mlehrer> lehaid: libc6-dev i think
[10:47] <sgirc> mr_daniel: I can't connect to my ISP, I'm using an usb modem which is alright (adslline is up)
[10:48] <sgirc> mr_daniel: my problem is when I lanch pppd
[10:48] <lupine_85> sgirc: some USB modems are supported, some aren't
[10:48] <fuffal0> what's ubuntu's equivalant to traceroute?
[10:48] <phoenix87ta> traceroute
[10:48] <fuffal0> hmmmmm
[10:48] <mr_daniel> lehaid: I think you have to install the package 'build essential'
[10:48] <lupine_85> needs installing
[10:48] <sgirc> mr_daniel: my modem is supported (connexant e-tech V2) and my ADSL line is up
[10:49] <runespy> ok now that ive used pastebin... i can now ask my question ^_^ .. http://pastebin.com/834155
[10:49] <tuxtux> notte a tutti
[10:49] <lehaid> mr_daniel: yeah i am now :)
[10:49] <phoenix87ta> fuffal0, there's a little gui for tracerouting in your system/administration/network tools
[10:49] <sgirc> mr_daniel: this is connection log file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34412/
[10:49] <mr_daniel> sgirc: sorry, I am using DSL and no modem, but maybe a 'man pppd' will help you

[10:50] <heatxsink> hello all, what exactly does ubuntu use to install it's distro?
[10:50] <runespy> could someone please awnser my question?? http://pastebin.com/834155
[10:50] <NoUse> sgirc ubotu is a bot
[10:50] <lupine_85> ubiquity
[10:50] <heatxsink> like the text menus and all of that
[10:50] <gbrent> heatxsink: it installs of the live cd
[10:50] <mattish-> org
[10:50] <lupine_85> (for the GUI one anyway)
[10:51] <eloque> ubotu: intercourse
[10:51] <gbrent> heatxsink: download the ISO, burn it and then on the desktop you will see an install icon
[10:51] <sgirc> NoUSe: a clever bot !
[10:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about intercourse - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:51] <mr_daniel> heatxsink: what you mean with '...what...does ubuntu use...' ?
[10:51] <heatxsink> like how did you guys make the menus when installing the distro
[10:51] <runespy> ... http://pastebin.com/834155 .. could someone awnser this?
[10:51] <uksprout> PLEASE!! can anyone offer help : sound problem . sound card is Soundblaster live OS: ubuntu 6.10 probem: sometimes I have sound sometimes I don't
[10:51] <sgirc> NoUse: can u tell me how u recognize a bot so that I appear less stupdi next time ?
[10:51] <gbrent> heatxsink: do you mean boot menues?
[10:52] <heatxsink> yes
[10:52] <heatxsink> that too
[10:52] <eloque> ubotu: how to peepee!
[10:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about how to peepee! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:52] <mr_daniel> heatxsink: what you mean with '...make the menus...' ?
[10:52] <NoUse> sgirc generally if it has the word 'bot' somewhere in the name
[10:52] <heatxsink> okay
[10:52] <phoenix87ta> uksprout, when you lose sound, all apps, or just one?
[10:52] <heatxsink> so when I install ubuntu server LTS, I get this menu I boot into
[10:52] <Nuked> eloque: dont play with the bots, it will anger them :)
[10:52] <heatxsink> then I select my option and press enter
[10:52] <eloque> ok ok i'm sorry
[10:52] <Nuked> and we know who THEM are
[10:52] <heatxsink> then the kernel boots
[10:52] <gbrent> heatxsink: well the boot menus are dual boot systems. You need to have multiple partitions and mulitple operating systems to do that. The grub boot manager needs to be configured to boot to either OS
[10:52] <eloque> it was pretty funny though
[10:52] <heatxsink> then I have to setup the system
[10:52] <runespy> can someone please awnser my question!? http://pastebin.com/834155
[10:53] <sod75> anyone know how to set the resolution of kdm, since edgy it's scaled an my laptop doesn't like the switching of resolution after i log in
[10:53] <lullabud> eloque:  actually, if you play with the bots you might get kicked.
[10:53] <mr_daniel> heatxsink: you can change the grub-menu with the file 'nano /boot/grub/menu.lst '
[10:53] <Nuked> eloque: it was
[10:53] <Slipp3d> ~ello all
[10:53] <uksprout> phoenix87ta: all I can play sound the reboot and no sound reboot several times and the sound will come back
[10:53] <Nuked> lullabud: thats what I meant
[10:53] <heatxsink> mr_daniel:  I understand the grub-menu stuff
[10:53] <gbrent> anyone running compiz?
[10:53] <eloque> lullabud... i think it was kinda worth it but oh well i apologized to uberbot
[10:53] <heatxsink> but is that what ubuntu-server LTS uses?
[10:53] <lullabud> Nuked:  ah... by "Them" you meant "the ops"... ;-)
[10:54] <eloque> yea i understood nuked when he first said it lullabud
[10:54] <runespy> uksprout: do sudo alsaconf ; in your command line, that worked for me...
[10:54] <Slipp3d> question about mozilla firefox and trying to switch the media plug in.... i would like to use vlc or kaff to handle my mms streams but dont' know where to switch it
[10:54] <AsheD> odd.
[10:54] <gbrent> heatxsink: they all use grub, but the different versions are for different things. For a desktop computer just straight ubuntu is best if thats what you are also asking
[10:54] <Nuked> eloque: but I was nicer about it, and still gave fair warning
[10:54] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Those results from du look to be correct.  Now run "cd / ; du -sk *" and see what we get.
[10:54] <mrlinux> help with dchp!!!!!!
[10:54] <eloque> yes u were a fair sport
[10:54] <Vigor> Dang, 1004 users?
[10:54] <aboutblank> mr_daniel, I'm an idiot. after my ubuntu box rebooted, Firestarter came back up. i hadn't realized that i had disabled it, as it's misconfigured. i thought i had uninstalled it.
[10:54] <runespy> just remember to do sudo killall alsad before doing the config
[10:54] <AsheD> every program I use tells me these mp3s have no tags, but they show as having tags in Rhythmbox
[10:54] <heatxsink> gbrent:  I dunno if that's what I'm asking
[10:55] <sod75> mrlinux: ask
[10:55] <heatxsink> I guess the question should be, if I wanted to make my own distro
[10:55] <linux_kid> !broadcom 4311
[10:55] <runespy> ..http://pastebin.com/834155 can someone awnser my question?

[10:55] <mr_daniel> runespy: it is very difficult to understand you. please don't write 'abook', be specific and phrase short lines
[10:55] <heatxsink> what does ubuntu use when booting up via a CD, and how did they make all of those nice "menuconfig" like menus and stuff
[10:55] <uksprout> runespy: command not found!
[10:55] <runespy> opps sorry, typo...
[10:55] <lehaid> how do i make "make" show me full compilation flags intead of just CC <filename> ?
[10:56] <mr_daniel> runespy: please no explain us our 'odysee', just ask EXACTLY what your problem is
[10:56] <sod75> lehaid: vi Makefile ?
[10:56] <runespy> uksprout: that shouldnt be rite, because i did that in debian and ubuntu, let me look through command refrences...
[10:56] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: Woot, you're back!   ok, I'm back from AFK too.  running that command, gimme a few minutes.
[10:56] <runespy> unless ubuntu dosent have alsa
[10:56] <Dreamglider> why is amarok so good ?
[10:57] <lehaid> sod75: where does it define there to HIDE them in the first place?
[10:57] <Dreamglider> it is slow as a mofo
[10:57] <uksprout> runespy: I cut and pasted so I *should* have got it right ;)
[10:57] <mr_daniel> lehaid: maybe 'make -d ...' ?
[10:57] <phoenix87ta> dreamglider, amarok works well for you?
[10:57] <eloque> sup dream
[10:57] <eloque> left dal huh?
[10:57] <Slipp3d> anyone  have a help for me?
[10:57] <sod75> lehaid: no idea, but you can see the flags there i guess
[10:57] <Dreamglider> eloque, nah
[10:57] <runespy> ok, one what my question is, to make the story short, i need to uninstall a messed up installation of ubuntu off of a harddrive that also has a winxp pro partition, its 100GB harddrive and winxp is only using 21 GB's
[10:57] <PEDRO> Hi
[10:58] <lehaid> mr_daniel: nop
[10:58] <Dreamglider> phoenix87ta, it works but it is slow as hell
[10:58] <PEDRO> I need help! I installed Beryl
[10:58] <lehaid> sod75: nop, it does some run time voodoo to find them
[10:58] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: ok, it shows all that data being in /root.  I'm going to try cd ing to that, and see what I can see.
[10:58] <phoenix87ta> dreamglider, okay, still trying to make my multimedia apps decisions
[10:58] <PEDRO> but I need to set a session so that I can start it without typing beryl-manager
[10:59] <runespy> did anyone see my question?
[10:59] <mr_daniel> runespy: yes I did
[10:59] <LjL> Ubotu, tell PEDRO about beryl | PEDRO, see the private message from Ubotu
[10:59] <runespy> ok thinking of a way?
[10:59] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: OK, I cd /root, ran the same command, and it gave me 4 block in /root/Desktop, and nothing else, and ls doesn't show anything.
[11:00] <Slipp3d> anyone any help with my firefox questions?
[11:00] <eloque> damn conexant gotta pay for a driver on a free os
[11:00] <eloque> BAH humbug
[11:00] <steveire> !seen soundray
[11:00] <ubotu> I last saw soundray (n=rolf@dsl-217-155-44-246.zen.co.uk) 19m 13s ago, quiting: "Leaving"
[11:01] <linux_kid> Slipp3d: whats your question?
[11:01] <poolkey172> tired :(
=== rmbl is now known as rmbl`off
[11:01] <LjL> eloque: ok, we got your disappointment, just buy a decent modem and stop whining, or write a free driver yourself.
[11:02] <runespy> mr_daniel, think of somthing?
[11:02] <Slipp3d> linux_kid  i am trying to change the plugin for firefox so that i'm using kaff or vlc to handle mms streams the question is where do i change the setting for that?
[11:02] <wigsta> Does anybody have a TV tuner card working with Ubuntu? Need some help using the IVTV driver! Specifically tunning the channels (UK frequency).
[11:02] <Slipp3d> at this time i'm unable to change it
[11:02] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: Well, a regular ls showed Desktop folder, but du -sk showed only 4 blocks being taken up by that same folder.  so the "files" that are taking up so much space must be in /root.  Sny suggestions on seeing them, removing them?
[11:02] <mr_daniel> runespy: no, I am busy with something else
[11:03] <runespy> ok...
[11:03] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: It stopped?  It should have kept on running and gone down the directory tree structure
[11:03] <linux_kid> Slipp3d: what is your ubuntu version and what is your firefox version
[11:03] <poolkey172> anyone know how wingrub works ?
[11:03] <drach> runespy: my suggestion - run gparted from a live-cd, resize  partition with winxp (or create a new ntfs partition), run recovery mode from installation winxp disk,  fixmbr, and you sholuld be able to boot win from that hd
[11:03] <eloque> the point was to get the attention of anybody else that might have gone through the same thing but fortunately for u all.. u weren't plagued by what i was. sorry
[11:04] <Slipp3d> firefox is ver 2.0 and ubuntu is the new one for down load
[11:04] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: Oh, the first du -sk did the directory trees, and showed 40 million blocks in root, so I cd'd there to track it down.  it only did one directory down.  inside /rootthere only seems to be one subdirectory, kand that's it
[11:04] <edd_> hello
[11:04] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Since you've got one single partition with the entirety of your filesystem on it, it takes a bit more effort to find the problems.
[11:05] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Then something's not right.  If all you see is / and one directory down, then we've got other issues.
[11:05] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV no, that's not it, sorry, I'm not explaining well, lemme paste results.  one moment
[11:05] <archis_> Hi anybody familiar with gconf? I have a q re. protocol handlers
[11:05] <Slipp3d> linux_kid i have the plugins installed ... just can't change the ones that it's using
[11:06] <linux_kid> Slipp3d: try this download and see if it helps... http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7713
[11:06] <archis_> I want to change the handler for rtsp and real streams from Totem to realplayer
[11:07] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34415/ shows the commands I delivered, and the results.  I'm talking about an actual directory /root, not the "root" directory "/"
[11:07] <edd_> can nebody help with a BCM4318 card?
[11:07] <Slipp3d> linux_kid it's not just that ...  i can't get kaffine to run in firefox
[11:07] <archis_> and the basic idea is to add a handler in about:config
[11:07] <archis_> like so http://ubit.buffalo.edu/linux/ublinux4/rtsp.php
[11:08] <linux_kid> Slipp3d: so you are using KDE or GNOME?
[11:08] <Slipp3d> gnome
[11:08] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: Line 20 of the paste shows what I saw, and aftrer that, I tried to track it down more, but an ls in that directory showed me nothing.
[11:08] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know why Ubuntu's Apache error pages are all weird and screwy ?  for example an error 404 produces this crap: "The requested URL was not found on this server. The link on the ">referring page seems to be wrong or outdated. Please inform the author of ">that page about the error. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again."
[11:08] <archis_> but FF, at least 2.0 doesn't use app hanlders in about:config but queries gconf
[11:08] <Samus_Aran> I haven't changed my apache config for the past several distros, and the error pages were always fine
[11:09] <Slipp3d> but i can't get any different plugins other then the one for totem ... and totem can't handle mms
[11:09] <winterp1> Is it possible to delete empty directory entries in gconf-editor? If yes, how? Tnx for responses...
[11:09] <kudzubane> wow, my edgy install is idling at a high load average, much higher than other distros, i wonder what is the culprit
[11:09] <archis_> so how should i proceed?
[11:10] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: what does top show ?
[11:10] <archis_> change the gconf setting or add app handler to FF
[11:10] <poolkey172> can someone plz help me ?
[11:10] <archis_> or both ;)
[11:10] <Slipp3d> kudzubane i would say it's beagle

[11:11] <edd_> can anybody help me install my BCM4318 card on edgy. i had it working on 6.06, but now it says there is no signal???
[11:11] <kudzubane> cafuego: what i copied/pasted is the relevant load averages
[11:12] <ActivE> is there a way i can list the terminal command cache so that i could search it with grep?
[11:12] <edd_> *no wireless signal
[11:12] <cafuego> kudzubane: Yes, but no process info.
[11:12] <cafuego> edd_: You need the firmware.
[11:12] <bimberi> ActivE: history
[11:12] <_david_> what does "sudo sfdisk -c /dev/sda 3 83" do?
[11:12] <edd_> firmware?
[11:13] <kudzubane> cafuego: interestingly, cpu load is mostly under 20% (and not sustained), no processes appears to be claiming much resources, but load average is still high
[11:13] <ActivE> perfect thankyou bimberi
[11:13] <bimberi> ActivE: np :)
[11:13] <edd_> which firmware do i need??
[11:13] <Slipp3d> linux_kid : any other thoughts?
[11:14] <Slipp3d> linux_kid : I'm using gnome
[11:14] <cafuego> kudzubane: You running software raid?
[11:14] <kudzubane> edd_: you need the proprietary firmware for that broadcom wireless chipset, you extract the firmware using the wireless windows driver, bcm43xx-cutter (install it) does the trick
[11:14] <linux_kid> Slipp3d: well, i didnt find anything on google or firefox.com, post somthing @ ubuntuforums.com

[11:16] <kudzubane> delliott: you might want to run a mem test
[11:16] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok, lets start w/ the basics, what card are you using?
[11:16] <fuffal0> in windows when i want to print to a printer that has an IP address, i setup a port mapped to an IP, and then setup a "local printer" with that port - how do iu do this in ubuntu

[11:17] <kudzubane> delliott: i remember seeing such an option at boot time using live/install cd, but it is on the x86 32bit version, so you need to check
[11:17] <dfxwer> has anyone heard of sabayon linux 3.2
[11:17] <ActivE> yes dfxwer

[11:20] <variant> you dont need sudo
[11:20] <edd_> <cafuego> : that hasnt done anything ????
[11:20] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok, hmmmm... try looking in synaptic and downloading both ndiswrapper and the gtk GUI of ndiswrapper
[11:20] <delliott> kudzubane: When I boot into the LiveCD to install it gives me a GNOME error with something to do with the Settings Daemon. Possibly related?
[11:20] <frandavid100> thanks monkeric
[11:20] <drael> Can someone help me with my Wine
[11:20] <cafuego> edd_: Install the package; then either ereload the wireless drivers (or just reboot)
[11:20] <drael> I think I spilled it
[11:20] <edd_> ok
[11:20] <kudzubane> delliott: dunno, the error you've described sounds unrelated (unless hw instability)
[11:20] <uksprout> kudzubane: sometimes I have sound but after a reboot I can lose it, if I reboot several times or turn the system off it will eventually come back
[11:20] <drael> When I try to install the MFC libraries, it gets stuck on 0%
[11:20] <monkeric> oh right you don't need sudo, I'm still stuck in FC5 land ;)
[11:21] <frandavid100> bye guys!
[11:21] <uksprout> kudzubane: it appears to effect all apps
[11:21] <Crescendo> I configured a few Gdesklets, and now when I try opening gdesklet, it just sits there, and hangs.  How do I fix this?
[11:21] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, source allso ?
[11:21] <kudzubane> uksprout: what variant of ubuntu?
[11:21] <linux_kid> Dreamslider: ya, source too
[11:21] <delliott> kudzubane: Apple provide hardware analysis CDs and I ran that earlier. It showed no problems.

[11:23] <linux_kid> Just an open question to all you MAC users: why can we not just take the airport drivers for your wireless and install them in linux, as osx is unix based?

[11:23] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, ok but i cant find the GUI
[11:24] <kudzubane> uksprout: that is strange, the fact you get sound at all indicates alsa working at least initially, dunno about losing sound, perhaps you are running into an oss/alsa blocking issue
[11:24] <delliott> linux_kid: Properietary chipset, I believe.
[11:24] <cyber_brain_mfkg> how to use ssh???
[11:24] <kudzubane> FFForever: 200m?
[11:24] <delliott> cyber_brain_mfkg: ssh user@hostname
[11:24] <linux_kid> delliot: thanx
[11:24] <FFForever> i have no clue, i got that from lspci
[11:24] <linux_kid> Dreamslider: do u have universe repositories allowed?
[11:24] <cyber_brain_mfkg> what can i use 4 user and hostname?
[11:24] <delliott> cyber_brain_mfkg: You should have been told that.
[11:24] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: WOOTAGE I found it!  And now, thinking back, I totally understand what happened.   In automatix, I installed the optional scripts to open nautilus under root permissions.  I've done this a number of times to manipulate files, when it's easier for me to do in a graphical environment, rather than terminal.  the "/root" directory is the "home" directory for the root account.  it has it's own .trash directory, which du didn't see for
[11:24] <delliott> You use ssh to connect securely (arguable) to a remote mahcine.
[11:25] <uksprout> kudzubane: it is very annoying checked the various website but cannot come up with anything.... how do I check for the oss/alsa blocking problem... sorry new to linux
[11:25] <kudzubane> FFForever: if it is indeed the infamous 200m, chances are you will not be getting any 3d acceleration
[11:25] <linux_kid> Dreamglider  do u have universe repositories allowed?
[11:25] <FFForever> ive seen it done
[11:25] <AsheD> is : a special char in regex stuff?
[11:25] <kudzubane> uksprout: this is my first full day with ubuntu, so take my advice with a grain of salt
[11:25] <cyber_brain_mfkg> look! i want 2 access my comp wrom my work where is installed M$ winXP
[11:25] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, yes
[11:25] <FFForever> and i guess it is the indamous 200m

[11:26] <Zaehlas> !thanks | TSWoodV
[11:26] <ubotu> TSWoodV: You're Welcome!
[11:26] <delliott> cyber_brain_mfkg: It is unlikely that you can SSH into your Windows XP machine unless it is running an SSH server.
[11:26] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: Good job!
[11:26] <TSWoodV> LOL!
[11:26] <kudzubane> uksprout: you got flashplugin going under firefox?
[11:26] <cyber_brain_mfkg> i have ubuntu at home
[11:26] <uksprout> kudzubane: yes but my problem is in vlc or the like before running firefoz
[11:26] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, edgy
[11:26] <cyber_brain_mfkg> and i want 2 access from work(winXP)
[11:27] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV: Gah, wish I'd know root had a home account, and all that.  it all makes sense in hindsight.  hehe.  just gotta be more careful.  if I HADN'T deleted 36 gigs of files as Root, I may never have found this problem, hehe
[11:27] <delliott> cyber_brain_mfkg: Ok. You need to know the hostname (perhaps IP address) of your home machine.
[11:27] <hutchy> cyber_brain_mfkg, need opensshd
[11:27] <delliott> hutchy: Doesn't Ubuntu come with a sshd by default?
[11:27] <TSWoodV> Zaehlas: You learned something today.  It's a good day! ;-)
[11:27] <cafuego> delliott: not installed, no.
[11:27] <Vladaz> hello
[11:28] <Jinkguns> Could someone tell me why OpenOffice crashes when I try to paste from it to a text box, such as thunderbird or a Gaim IM?
[11:28] <Vladaz> when i run anjuta new gtk+ project and execute it, it says, that glade file couldn't be found, does it suppose to do?
[11:28] <aimtrainer> hi! Can anyone tell me a good way to convert video files (mostly xvid) for my cellphone which understands mpg and 3gp? I googled a bit and found some ways for 3gp but always failed at getting ffmpeg to support 3gp 8[
[11:28] <trappist> Jinkguns: I think I saw a bug report on that
[11:28] <Vladaz> glade file is in its place
[11:28] <Vladaz> what's wrong?
[11:28] <uksprout> kudzubane: I could be wrong but I don't think it is coming from there,  the alsa mixer lists three devices my soundblaster,  a via 8235 & CMI 9739 (which is the only OSS device)
[11:28] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok let me search around packages.ubuntu.com unless you dont want the gui...
[11:29] <cyber_brain_mfkg> ok that means i shoul install opensshd first???
[11:29] <monkeric> cyber_brain_mkfg: this is where I got the info to set up my sshd:  http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howot-install-ubuntu-linux-ssh-server.html
[11:29] <Jinkguns> trappist: is there a work around?
[11:29] <cyber_brain_mfkg> *should
[11:29] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, pleas i need the gui i suck at terminal
[11:29] <kudzubane> uksprout: flash is just one easy way to find out whether oss is causing issues
[11:29] <kudzubane> uksprout: the 7.x version of plugin uses oss
[11:29] <kudzubane> uksprout: other apps could be doing the same
[11:29] <uksprout> kudzubane: ah ok...
[11:29] <Zaehlas> TSWoodV hehe, yep.  thanks.  =D  I'll be back with future problems, at some point.
[11:29] <lehaid> thanks for all the help, got what i wanted to work, good day !
[11:29] <Zaehlas> Later all
[11:30] <wigsta> Does anybody have a TV tuner card working with Ubuntu? Need some help using the IVTV driver! Specifically tunning the channels (UK frequency).
[11:30] <cyber_brain_mfkg> should i run ssh at home before i access from work?
=== TheDebugger is now known as Papa
[11:30] <dragonfyre13> Alright guys, I just wrote a full guide on the Averatec 2370. Anyone wanna check it out for me? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=308152
[11:30] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: i hear you, i hate terminal, although i marvel its power
[11:30] <BryanJorgenson> Does anyone know how to recover data from an ext3 device if the inodes are intact but the ubuntu installer may have formatted as reiserfs?
[11:30] <uksprout> kudzubane: just trying to find an online game with sound
=== Papa is now known as TheDebugger
[11:30] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: I meant, what apps does it show using CPU time, and check the column that divides up the "time" into I/O wait, user processes, system processes, etc.
[11:31] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: here we go... http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/ndisgtk
[11:31] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, not that i hate it, i just suck at it.
[11:31] <uksprout> kudzubane: no audio from flash game
[11:31] <kudzubane> Samus_Aran: as i mentioned earlier, that's the funny thing, cpu usag is not abnormally high, and disk usage is not excessive
[11:32] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, where is the GUI file?
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: check what I said, it divides it up
[11:32] <BryanJorgenson> Can anyone help me recover data from an ext3 partition? The inodes were not deleted!
[11:32] <Vladaz> anyone
[11:32] <Vladaz> please
[11:32] <Vladaz> help me
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: e.g. Cpu(s): 13.9%us, 10.4%sy, 27.7%ni, 45.0%id,  0.9%wa,  1.1%hi,  1.0%si,  0.0%st
[11:32] <kudzubane> uksprout: try something that isn't utilizing oss
[11:32] <monkeric> cyber_brain_mfkg: it's a bit involved.  You need to have the openssh (sshd) server daemon running, and you need to install the public half of your key (from work) in your sshd list of remote hosts.  you can generate a key pair from your ssh client at work.
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: and a wait time of less than 1.00 is completely fine
[11:32] <Vladaz> when i run anjuta new gtk+ project and execute it, it says, that glade file couldn't be found, does it suppose to do?
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: I mean a load average
[11:32] <Vladaz> what's wrong?
[11:33] <pac> How do I do a full install of Ubuntu?   Like install all the packages that have the little ubuntu logo in Synaptic.  Thanks!
[11:33] <edd_> <cafuego>: that hasnt worked?
[11:33] <kudzubane> Samus_Aran: top - 17:32:55 up  5:10,  2 users,  load average: 0.69, 0.68, 0.64

[11:33] <kudzubane> sorry about the errant paste, folks
[11:33] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: 1.00 just means it is running at peak efficiency, for every CPU task that completes, there is one more waiting to be processed
[11:33] <uri3000> I know this has gotta be something simple, but I'm having trouble accessing Disc 2 of the Quake IV installation discs. I get an error saying I have insufficient permissions to access the contents of the disc. Help? :D
[11:33] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: it's once it gets above 1.00 that things will start to slow down
[11:34] <kudzubane> Samus_Aran: on other install (distro), i average 0.00 most of the time

[11:34] <pac> How do I do a full install of Ubuntu?   Like install all the packages that have the little ubuntu logo in Synaptic.  Thanks!
[11:34] <kudzubane> Samus_Aran: perhaps ubuntu  is just busier
[11:34] <Samus_Aran> kudzubane: you should check what those two mean from the man page, then you can track down what is using up time

[11:35] <pac> dragonfyre and samus_aran: thanks!     good idea =] 
[11:35] <Samus_Aran> pac: if you install things you know you will never even look at, it will just slow down things like upgrades and scanning the packages database
[11:36] <dragonfyre13> pac: no problem.
[11:36] <Samus_Aran> pac: it won't make the system unstable like Windows, however =)
[11:36] <linux_kid> good, no go to Sytstem->Administration->Windows Drivers (or somthing like that...)
[11:36] <uri3000> pac: i don't understand what you want me to do. i know what sudo is, more or less, but i don't understand how to use it in conjunction with reading a cd rom. :P

[11:36] <Samus_Aran> pac: I have around 8GiB of Ubuntu packages installed, I think

[11:36] <delliott> And trying to remove all of it seems impossible.
[11:36] <dragonfyre13> delliott: so remove it.
[11:37] <dragonfyre13> delliott: grab deborphan
[11:37] <Samus_Aran> pac: I install everything that even looks a bit interesting, heh.  I devoted a 20GiB partition just for Ubuntu and its files, so I could install without worry
[11:37] <pac> uri3000: sudo nautilus  will give you a file browser with root access.   from there you can change file permissions etc
[11:37] <edd_> nebody?

[11:37] <dragonfyre13> edd_: what chipset?
[11:37] <Samus_Aran> delliott: just don't use it as your desktop environment, there are still numerous great KDE apps that don't have good equivalents elsewhere

[11:38] <dragonfyre13> edd_: what chipset?
[11:38] <edd_> errrm
[11:38] <Samus_Aran> pac: you can't just install all of them at once, as many of them conflict with one another (replacements for each other)
[11:38] <dragonfyre13> edd_: ok, lemme see then.
[11:38] <delliott> Samus_Aran: Yeah, I know. I used Kile.
[11:38] <dragonfyre13> edd_: it's ok, just wanted to know if you knew off hand.

[11:39] <edd_> idk
[11:39] <dragonfyre13> edd_: err, the card.
[11:39] <linux_kid> dreamglider: when you put the card in while in windows, did you install a driver?
[11:39] <Samus_Aran> delliott: ah
[11:39] <edd_>  BCM4318 card
[11:39] <dragonfyre13> thnks
[11:39] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: gtg, bbl
[11:40] <pac> phobiac the deleted partition data will still physically be there -- but inaccessible with software
[11:40] <Samus_Aran> phobiac: I would definitely consult the documentation on that one before clicking any 'okay' buttons, but as far as I know, gparted is supposed to do non-destructive resizes
[11:40] <poolkey172> hello
[11:40] <Samus_Aran> phobiac: you might need to already have free space after the partition, though
[11:40] <phobiac> Okay, thank you. I'm just worried about the files themselves.
[11:41] <uri3000> pac: I figured it out, thanks!
[11:41] <poolkey172> how can see what harddisks are available from busybox ?
[11:42] <iagoba> i have problems by changing my screen resolution
[11:42] <dragonfyre13> edd_: Ok, you have two choices. First, the linux kernel comes with a native driver for this in edgy. Second, you can look into NdisWrapper if that doesn't work/
[11:42] <alek66> I get a ACPI: Critical trip point and my computer shuts down without any warnings....
[11:42] <x-fak> could i remove ipv6 support with ubuntu breezy ?
[11:42] <edd_> ndiswrapper doesnt work
[11:42] <Samus_Aran> gotta go.
[11:42] <poolkey172> anyone ?
[11:43] <dragonfyre13> edd_: whattya mean?
[11:43] <alek66> edd_,  what is wrong with your ndiswrapper....?
[11:43] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, that didnt do anything"
[11:43] <edd_> i tried it with the code from the forums erlier and it wouldnt work
[11:43] <dragonfyre13> edd_: oh, so it doesn't work YET.
[11:43] <edd_> the driver was there there was no errors
[11:43] <dragonfyre13> edd_: sometimes it takes some finess.
[11:43] <edd_> lol
[11:43] <edd_> like?
[11:43] <dragonfyre13> ^_^
[11:43] <poolkey172> dont worry I've worked it out
[11:44] <alek66> edd_,  did you cheked this one http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=498542
[11:44] <dragonfyre13> well, I don't know crap about ndiswrapper.
[11:44] <graham_100_> kim^j u still there??
[11:44] <alek66> I get a ACPI: Critical trip point and my computer shuts down without any warnings.... does anyone know how to fix this?
[11:44] <edd_> no i havent seen that 1
[11:45] <dragonfyre13> edd_: looks like you have some good help. Just let people know that you are having an issue with getting ndiswrapper to work with your broadcom card, and you will get the help you need.
[11:45] <edd_> kk
[11:45] <x-fak> can i remove ipv6 network interface? which package should i uninstall to do this?
[11:45] <Stormx2> Yo. Is there an app for ubuntu that will periodicly check mail, and if there is anything new, can pass the details along to a script?
[11:45] <dragonfyre13> edd_: sometimes the hardest thing to do is ask the right question.
[11:45] <edd_> yeah i know what u mean
[11:45] <alek66> dragonfyre13, TRue! asking the right question is a problem
[11:45] <dragonfyre13> edd_: even though I don't know how to solve you issue, I do know the question to ask.
[11:45] <edd_> yeah?
[11:46] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Yep

[11:50] <poolkey172> HELLO ! How do I use the initramfs shell ?
[11:50] <graham_100_> kim^j doesn't say anything
[11:50] <poolkey172> I need to get an output similiar like dmesg
[11:50] <uksprout> kudzubane: no audio from rhytym box sorry took so long had to install plugins for the app
[11:50] <pac> Crescendo: find the gdesklets configuration file and restore a backup or try renaming it
[11:51] <Dreamglider> can anyone help me with wireless connetions ?
[11:51] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Go check what's in /mnt then! :)
[11:51] <TonySoprano> some1 can tell me how to upgrade a breezy badger to the last version?
[11:51] <Kim^J> TonySoprano: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:51] <Kim^J> But I would recommend a new install of Edgy Eft. :)
[11:51] <tonyyarusso> Kim^J, TonySoprano: not true!
[11:51] <TonySoprano> thank i try this in a root bash
[11:52] <tonyyarusso> !upgrade | TonySoprano
[11:52] <ubotu> TonySoprano: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:52] <graham_100_> kim^j now i cant open the drive but it's mounted
[11:52] <TonySoprano> hmmmm
[11:52] <delliott> I tried to run live video=ofonly and it is just sitting at a peach coloured screen with a mouse. Any ideas?
[11:52] <tonyyarusso> Kim^J: Just a flat out dist-upgrade will break things often.
[11:52] <Kim^J> graham_100_: How do you try to open it?
[11:52] <poolkey172> Can someone help me with initramfs please ?
[11:52] <Kim^J> tonyyarusso: I dunno. I don't use it.
[11:52] <uri3000> Does anybody play Quake IV on Ubuntu?
[11:52] <Stormx2> Yo. Is there an app for ubuntu that will periodicly check mail, and if there is anything new, can pass the details along to a script?
[11:52] <TonySoprano> so i follow you tonyyarusso
[11:52] <graham_100_> kim^j double click and open in right click meu *neither work
[11:53] <lokki> i did a apt-get dist-upgrade and my system froze on the configuration step witch caused my system unworkable, just an other story
[11:53] <Kim^J> graham_100_: In a shell: cd /mnt
[11:53] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Then: ls -lA
[11:53] <recepcion1> HI
[11:53] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Then try this: touch hello
[11:53] <bran> Are there no 32bit emulation libs provided with AMD64 version of Ubuntu????
[11:53] <Kim^J> graham_100_: And finally: df -h
[11:53] <recepcion1> JUAREZ
[11:53] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: i am sorry, dinner calls!
[11:54] <Kim^J> recepcion1: Hi there.
[11:54] <Dreamglider> linux_kid,  it's ok mate
[11:54] <lokki> bran: read the amd64 howto's
[11:54] <recepcion1> JUAREZ CHIHUAHUA  MEXICO
[11:54] <lokki> u can have 32 bit but on a chroot'ed env
[11:54] <Sadness> hi
[11:54] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok, lets see... did you have to install anything to get the wireless working in windows?
[11:54] <bran> lokki: why no emul-* libs?
[11:54] <Sadness> I have a problem
[11:54] <TonySoprano> pls where can i see my actual ubuntu version? not kernel version
[11:54] <Sadness> I installed aiglx on edgy
[11:55] <graham_100_> kim^j still wont open
[11:55] <fildo> now thats just Sadness
[11:55] <Sadness> I upgraded to the beta nvidia drivers
[11:55] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What does it say then?
[11:55] <bran> lokki: I have to chroot just to run mplayer geez, never fucking mind, back to gentoo
[11:55] <lokki> well ask the authors i really havent read so far about 64-32 mixed mode
[11:55] <Sadness> but now I can't switch to the virtual terminals
[11:55] <lokki> the prob i think is the naming conversion of the libs
[11:55] <linux_kid> TonySoprano: go to System->About Ubuntu  ... it should tell u somewhere in the text
[11:55] <graham_100_> kim^j nothing
[11:55] <Sadness> control+alt+f1 doesn't work
[11:55] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, yes drivers for the card
[11:55] <poolkey172> FINALLY ! AFTER 24 HOURS OF MESSING AROUND I got dual raid cards windows plus ubuntu working together : PHEW
[11:55] <Kim^J> graham_100_: Huh?
[11:56] <bimberi> !version | TonySoprano
[11:56] <ubotu> TonySoprano: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[11:56] <graham_100_> kim^j and when i try to double click open it nothing happens same as before
[11:56] <poolkey172> drink time for me
[11:56] <pac> poolkey: gratz
[11:56] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, but i let windows controll the card
[11:56] <Kim^J> graham_100_: try this: cd / && ls -lA
[11:56] <poolkey172> pac : thanks it was a pain
[11:56] <graham_100_> kim^j getting fed up with all these problems now
[11:56] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: do you still have the cd or the file on your windows partition?
[11:56] <Alystair> is there a way to get ZFS working in Ubuntu? ;D
[11:56] <Sadness> it works on gdm
[11:56] <Sadness> but not after the login
[11:56] <bimberi> poolkey172: don't forget you learnt dpkg as well :P
[11:57] <poolkey172> lol @ bimb
[11:57] <graham_100_> kim^j whats all that writing for then?
[11:57] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, the x-micro folder is on thewindows partion
[11:57] <pac> graham_100 sounds like standard unix use to me
[11:57] <Sadness> any suggestion?
[11:57] <poolkey172> takes 10seconds to boot kubuntu :)
[11:58] <graham_100_> pac are these usual problems?
[11:58] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: do you have an exe or inf and sys file from the windows partition or from xmicro's site?
[11:58] <poolkey172> I'll produce some bootcharts
[11:58] <Kim^J> graham_100_: cd is change directory. And in that example: change directory to / && (and) list -Almost all and list modes.
[11:58] <pac> poolkey: try xubuntu.. woo
[11:58] <poolkey172> pac : I use fluxbox with a little kde
[11:58] <graham_100_> kim^j is there a better linux free programme than 6.06lts to use??
[11:58] <Kim^J> graham_100_: So... What did the command output?

[11:58] <Dreamglider> good enough?
[11:59] <cyber_brain_mfkg> how to exit edit mode in vi?
[11:59] <bimberi> cyber_brain_mfkg: <ESC>
[11:59] <graham_100_> kim^j there is too mutch to write out
[11:59] <Kim^J> graham_100_: What you mean better? Faster? Smoother? Easier? Harder? Better suited for that work?
[11:59] <cyber_brain_mfkg> and how to save?
[11:59] <Kim^J> graham_100_: WHAT DID IT WRITE???
[11:59] <bimberi> cyber_brain_mfkg: :wq!
[12:00] <cyber_brain_mfkg> ok
[12:00] <linux_kid> Dreamglider: ok, load the cd and search it for an instalation exe
[12:00] <Kim^J> graham_100_: cd / and then ls -lA

[12:00] <bimberi> cyber_brain_mfkg: er, :w!  if you don't want to quit as well
[12:00] <Dreamglider> linux_kid, ok i have it
[12:00] <Kim^J> graham_100_: http://www.pastebin.ca
[12:00] <bimberi> cyber_brain_mfkg: yw :)
