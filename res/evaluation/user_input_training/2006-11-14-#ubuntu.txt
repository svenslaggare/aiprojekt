[12:01] <Kyral> nuts: If you are using a terminal emulator in X (Like GNOME-Terminal or Konsole) there should be an option for it
[12:01] <awesomepetter> LjL i tried "gdm start" and there was no button too
[12:01] <Clin1> Can some one help with an error 504 in Open Office
[12:01] <nuts> yeah I know, Kyral, just installed edgy, and wanted to know which terminal application I should stick too !? any idea?
[12:01] <awesomepetter> LjL as root, as sudo etc..
[12:01] <awesomepetter> LjL neither in GDM or Gnome when i logged in
[12:02] <Kyral> nuts: If you mean for IRC, Irssi is considered the best
[12:02] <nuts> yeah, which console (eg rxvt gnometerminal eterm) are you using?
[12:02] <Akuma_> i keep trying different keyboard shortcuts for set_terminal_title in gconf-editor, and none of them work... whats wrong with it/me ?
[12:02] <Shadow_mil> how can you install ubuntu from the CD when your not running a GUI?
[12:02] <jardas> how can I list manually installed packages with aptitude?
[12:02] <Kyral> nuts: I run KDE, so I use Konsole
[12:02] <awesomepetter> LjL i just got Logout, Switch User, Lock Screen and Hibernate
[12:02] <LjL> Shadow_mil, uh? the CD *comes* with a GUI
[12:03] <Kyral> nuts: On my laptop I run Fluxbox and I use Urxvt (also called rxvt-unicode)
[12:03] <awesomepetter> LjL could you point me to where i should search for the problem?
[12:03] <nuts> Kyral: ok, I c, you use any specified font for irssi ?!
[12:03] <Shadow_mil> LjL: yeah... I had to kill it, its running too slow
[12:03] <] -[erbie> I have a weird problem with internet access (Ubuntu 6.10 just installed): I can load pages in firefox only after trying for several minutes.. it doesn't connect. but ping works perfectly. traceroute shows that it stops somewhere in the middle... but after several retries it magically goes all the way through
[12:03] <tonyyarusso> !alternate | Shadow_mil
[12:03] <ubotu> Shadow_mil: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[12:03] <Kyral> nuts: That is generally controlled by the terminal emulator
[12:03] <LjL> awesomepetter, i *understood* your problem. i just haven't the slightest idea. and i'm googling.
[12:03] <] -[erbie> same PC, other OS: all works perfectly
[12:03] <awesomepetter> LjL thx, me to :)
[12:03] <LjL> Shadow_mil: use the alternate cd then
[12:04] <nuts> Kyral: yeah I just wanted to know if theres any monospace font that kicks a$$ with irssi :)
[12:04] <] -[erbie> any help/suggestion?
[12:04] <Shadow_mil> tonyyarusso: I need to get it up an running asap... and do not have the time to down load another 600 MB
[12:04] <jardas> how can I list manually installed packages with aptitude?
[12:04] <Kyral> nuts: Sorry, I'm none too picky about fonts :P
[12:04] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: I think it's your only option
[12:04] <Shadow_mil> fine Ill do a net install...
[12:04] <nuts> Kyral: okayyyy, cheers =)
[12:04] <Shadow_mil> pfft
[12:04] <M_Fatih> hi everybody
[12:05] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: Maybe you could go with the server install disk, and install the rest on top of that once things are up and running.  It's quite a bit smaller.
[12:05] <awesomepetter> LjL i should mention that i played with the sudoers file before than happened
[12:05] <nuts> Kyral: wouldnt I install rxvt-unicode with apt-get install rxvt-unicode?
[12:05] <LjL> awesomepetter, oh. that could possibly explain it, but can you use sudo now anyway?
[12:05] <crimsun> nuts: if you want Xft support, yes
[12:05] <jardas> Does anyone knows how can I list manually installed packages with aptitude? Please
[12:05] <Kyral> nuts: I think I don't use Ubuntu anymore
[12:06] <awesomepetter> LjL yeah, i fixed the sudoers file in single user mode
[12:06] <Shadow_mil> I really need it up and running in less then 3 hours... and its going to take 3 hours to install on that slow computer
[12:06] <awesomepetter> LjL and it works
[12:06] <nuts> ok:)
[12:06] <nuts> crimsun: E: Couldn't find package rxvt-unicode
[12:06] <RegalEagle> Is an Admin the only useraccount that can sudo by default>
[12:06] <LjL> awesomepetter: so now sudoers lists the "admin" group as the group with access, and you're a member of that group?
[12:06] <RegalEagle> ?
[12:06] <crimsun> nuts: you don't have universe enabled
[12:06] <M_Fatih> i want to import my old mails in gmail (~7000 old mail (archive)) to thunderbird. when i added my pop account information, thunderbird downloads only new mail since my pop account setting up.. But i want to download olm mails, i can't do that, how can i do it? :( this is my serious problem :( help me..
[12:06] <LjL> RegalEagle: a member of the "admin" group, yes
[12:06] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: How would it take three hours to install?  The longest I think I've ever heard of is half that; most under a quarter.
[12:06] <RegalEagle> thanks
[12:07] <Shadow_mil> tonyyarusso: its a 400 MHz with 128 MB or ram
[12:07] <Shadow_mil> of*
[12:07] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: Even so..
[12:07] <LjL> awesomepetter, i don't seem to find anything
[12:07] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: Do you need X up and running at that three hour mark, or just the base system?
[12:07] <Shadow_mil> X up and running
[12:07] <awesomepetter> LjL http://pastebin.com/823696
[12:08] <awesomepetter> LjL sudoers file
[12:08] <[DFC] Eggman> Shadow_mil: thats a slow machine, but i got a 166mhz lappy up and fully running in 2 hours
[12:08] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: Then you have little wiggle room.
[12:08] <Shadow_mil> tonyyarusso: and I am on dial up -_-
[12:08] <jardas> Does anyone knows how can I list manually installed packages with aptitude? Please
[12:08] <tonyyarusso> Shadow_mil: Why the sudden need to install anyway?
[12:08] <LjL> awesomepetter: file's fine
[12:09] <[DFC] Eggman> Shadow_mil: it might be faster to order the CDs then ;)
[12:09] <Shadow_mil> tonyyarusso: I tried up grading one of out machines from dapper to edgy... and it didn't work
[12:09] <Shadow_mil> thats why
[12:09] <Shadow_mil> and time is money and my boss wants it up asap
[12:09] <awesomepetter> LjL i found something here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=244662 brb

[12:10] <slew> hi, i have an error that says "your audio capture settings are invalid. please correct them in the multimedia settings." how do i fix this?
[12:10] <awesomepetter> LjL yeah ;) "Show action buttons"
[12:11] <Shadow_mil> I am starting to think net install would be the fastest... I could tar the while / file and then download the tar to the broken machine, then untar it... then install the boot loader
[12:11] <LjL> awesomepetter, hehe alright, problem is, i'm a KDE user myself ;)
[12:11] <awesomepetter> LjL :)
[12:11] <awesomepetter> LjL anyway, thx :)
[12:12] <Shadow_mil> better yet, I could copy the whole hd with netcat

[12:17] <xst> After upgrading to edgy, all the moutpoints listed in /etc/fstab are being mounted - even if they have a "noauto"-option. Why are they mounted and how can I disable this auto mounting?
[12:17] <ompaul> boozey, several
[12:17] <what_if> BadKitty: is there a fix for this ? I really like ubuntu :)
[12:17] <infidel> bimberi, i did that but my keys are sticking
[12:18] <what_if> BadKitty: would hate to have to download suse 10.1 and deal with RPM's again
[12:18] <BadKitty> what_if; have you checked the configuration of your xorg.conf?
[12:18] <ompaul> boozey, ask a specific question
[12:18] <what_if> BadKitty: yes, it loads the module "nv"
[12:18] <bimberi> infidel: sticking?
[12:18] <BadKitty> but did you check to see that your screen resolution was correct and everything?
[12:18] <lord_nelson> Edgy is garbage, what a step back from Dapper

[12:19] <what_if> BadKitty: no, desktop
[12:19] <ncharles> I have set the speed_limit_min via an echo cmd, using /etc/sysctl.conf and the sysctl app itself, but no matter what I do, when I type cat /proc/mdstat the array still rebulds at the default 1000K!
[12:20] <NightHawke> would a printer shared on a windows network show up on a network browser?
[12:20] <boozey> ompaul: whats a good control panel for ubuntu that controls apache, mysql and ftp
[12:20] <BadKitty> what_if: You could try it... I went from dapper to edgy and had that problem until I got the stable version... did you run edgy stable?
[12:20] <ncharles> How do you get an array to rebuild faster?
[12:20] <what_if> BadKitty: edgy stable ??
[12:20] <Joe_CoT> boozy: ISPconfig

[12:21] <bimberi> *Printing
[12:21] <sally2> my computer is running out of memory so I'm trying to figure out which directories I can get rid of in the etc directory
[12:21] <BadKitty> what-if: Yah, they come out with different builds until they make a stable release... if its 6.10 then its the stable version
[12:21] <sally2> anyone know?
[12:21] <ompaul> boozey, I  don't do apache via a panel :)
[12:21] <crimsun> sally2: that's generally a bad approach
[12:21] <what_if> BadKitty: yep, i have 6.10
[12:21] <NightHawke> bimberi, printer config mounts the printer via SMB, but refuses to print to the host (win2k)
[12:21] <LjL> lord_nelson: maybe it would help if you described what this plaguing problem is
[12:21] <stefan> sally2: why in etc?
[12:21] <BadKitty> what_if; are all of the graphics messed up and distorted, or only after you get into X?
[12:21] <NightHawke> HP laserjet 1100, the rock of gibraltar
[12:21] <sally2> crimsun: the etc is where all the memory that is being used
[12:21] <what_if> BadKitty: yes
[12:22] <what_if> BadKitty: console works fine
[12:22] <BadKitty> yes to which?
[12:22] <crimsun> sally2: compared with /usr ? I find that difficult to believe.
[12:22] <sally2> also, when you uninstall packages, does it remove the programs from the etc?
[12:22] <LjL> sally2, i doubt it. what does "du -s /etc" say?
[12:22] <NightHawke> tried unstalling printer using both administrative and guest account access
[12:22] <what_if> BadKitty: X=bad    console=good
[12:22] <NightHawke> er installing
[12:22] <tempted> anybody had issues with beryl... where the window decorations... ie. theme.. is flashing.. and using a bunch a of cpu?
[12:22] <sally2> crimsun: etc has 10 gbs and usr has almost 3 gbs
[12:22] <lord_nelson> my pc hangs on the splash screen when I shutdown
[12:22] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell tempted about beryl
[12:23] <LjL> sally2, if /etc is 10Gb, there's something seriously wrong.
[12:23] <BadKitty> what_if: Im pretty new to linux and ubuntu, but I'd imagine that its either a problem with your X configuration.
[12:23] <crimsun> sally2: ...10 GB in /etc ? What in the world did you put in there?
[12:23] <tempted> LjL: what?
[12:23] <bimberi> NightHawke: hmmk.  Is access to the printer enabled on the win2k box?
[12:23] <LjL> sally2, type "du /etc | sort -n" and find out where the space is used
[12:23] <LjL> tempted, what ubotu just told you
[12:23] <NightHawke> plus UNIX printer sharing service is installed
[12:23] <stefan> sally2: did you move your usr to etc? ;-)
[12:23] <BadKitty> what_if: have you tried using nvidia drivers instead of default nv?
[12:23] <sally2> stefan: no
[12:23] <what_if> BadKitty: are they installed by default ??
[12:23] <sally2> haven't touched either directory, just checked the properties of each folder
[12:23] <boozey> Joe_CoT hard to install?
[12:23] <BadKitty> tempted type this: /join #ubuntu-xgl
[12:23] <tempted> thanks

[12:24] <delight> I got an laptop with a Ati X600 ... I wanted to run the open source driver .. it got problems thou on resolutions higher then 1024 ... screen is 1400 * 1050
[12:24] <sally2> LjL: what is that number?
[12:24] <delight> screen is all messed up
[12:24] <LjL> sally2, that 16 *mega*bytes
[12:24] <BadKitty> what_if: nv is a default driver... you would have to download the new nvidia drivers, what type of card do you have?
[12:24] <delight> got anybody the X600 to work with the opensource ati driver ?
[12:24] <what_if> BadKitty: can't do that... can't even install
[12:24] <NightHawke> Hold that thought...
[12:24] <crimsun> delight: no. I had to use fglrx.
[12:24] <Akuma_> how do i get 'alias' to be used by all terminals and not just the one it's been set in?
[12:24] <what_if> BadKitty: GF 6600 gs
[12:24] <bimberi> NightHawke: hm, how about the hint here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPPrinter
[12:24] <LjL> Akuma_: add it to .bash_rc
[12:24] <BadKitty> what_if, you should be able to install the drivers from the console
[12:24] <Akuma_> LjL: thanks
[12:25] <Joe_CoT> boozey: there's there how-to at howtoforge on what needs to be installed. basically, apache, php, mysql, bind, quota, etc. ispconfig might be a bit of overkill for you
[12:25] <LjL> Akuma_: .bashrc even
[12:25] <what_if> BadKitty: ok, then how do I restart the installer
[12:25] <NightHawke> i got it bimberi! had to rework the printer processor!
[12:25] <NightHawke> printer's thinking now
[12:25] <delight> crimsun fglrx does not work with aiglx ... that sux ... did u look for a fix / solving before installing fglrx ?
[12:25] <funkyHat> Anyone else with a Toshiba laptop (or any other I guess...) found the touchpad drivers went a bit flat after upgrading to edgy? :(
[12:25] <bimberi> NightHawke: good work :)
[12:25] <botxj> what's the site for the pastebin?
[12:25] <bimberi> !pastebin > botxj
[12:25] <botxj> thank you!
[12:25] <what_if> BadKitty: I changed "nv" to "vga" once and restarted X, but the desktop came up instead of the installer
=== jmantra is now known as jman_
[12:26] <BadKitty> what_if: I'm not sure.. did you try the usual (ctrl-alt-delete)?
[12:26] <bimberi> botxj: yw :)
[12:26] <lupine_85> funkyHat: my tecra doesn't have a touchpad :p
[12:26] <NightHawke> oh shazbot.. it thinks the printer's a color unit
[12:26] <NightHawke> :p
[12:26] <what_if> BadKitty: yeah, restarts and the file is back to original (messed up)

[12:27] <sally2> I guess it's the usr that wins out
[12:27] <NightHawke> lol, it printed the color scales in greyscale
[12:27] <sally2> sorry, jesus christ
[12:27] <what_if> wheelswitch: start>finish
[12:27] <BadKitty> what_if: you might also want to try the command line install instead of the graphical interface
[12:27] <stefan> sally2: jesus christ is not on ;-)
[12:27] <wheelswitch> what_if:  ?
[12:27] <NightHawke> his cousin's on :p
[12:27] <sally2> stefan: LOL!
[12:27] <NightHawke> oh and his half brother, lucifier is too :p
[12:28] <what_if> wheelswitch: ;)
[12:28] <LjL> sally2, i suggest you use "du" from the console ("man du" for more info) or Baobab (if you're on Gnome) to find out where the space is used. and, in any case, *never* remove stuff from / manually.
[12:28] <sally2> I feel goddamn stupid, but at least I got some command line stuff to work with, thanks everyone and LjL

[12:28] <what_if> BadKitty: and then fix the install after installed ??
=== sharperguy is now known as spoonerguy
[12:28] <infidel> bimberi, when i depress like ie.. increase volume key it won't stop it keeps raising the volume
[12:28] <LjL> sally2, perhaps "sudo apt-get clean" will free you some space (that will delete all the packages you've downloaded and installed from the cache - the packages will stay installed, just the file they were installed from will be deleted)
[12:29] <BadKitty> what_if: that's how I would try and do it.
=== spoonerguy is now known as sharperguy-appar
[12:29] <bimberi> infidel: ah, right.  not sure about that sorry :|
[12:29] <LjL> sally2, and if there's something going bad in your system, perhaps some file in /var has become huge. you could check that as well using du or something, if all else fails
[12:29] <sally2> brilliant, LjL, that's probably what I need
[12:29] <what_if> BadKitty: well, I think I will go with openSuSE... if I have to install ubuntu then _fix_ it before I use it then there are issues, apparently
[12:29] <infidel> bimberi, no, problem. thanks anyway

[12:30] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[12:30] <BadKitty> what_if: can't you download the driver using the console and test it to see if that works?
[12:30] <what_if> BadKitty: I could
[12:30] <crimsun> delight: no, because aiglx isn't important to me

[12:33] <noelferreira> and it worked fine
[12:33] <lupine_85> mm, they're supported OOTB in edgy now :)
[12:33] <shingalated> thanks bimberi
[12:34] <BadKitty> what_if: lol ok,good luck to yah.. is it opensuse?
[12:34] <bimberi> shingalated: np :)
[12:34] <packman_e> hello guys, can anyone here help me with a little problem i am having with ubunto 6.06 please. after installing and logging in, I get these fuzzy lines running down the screen, can anyone assist me in getting rid of them please?
[12:34] <lupine_85> it will e@t j00r dataz and force you to be friends with Microsoft
[12:34] <noelferreira> so what should we do lupine_85?
[12:34] <what_if> BadKitty: ubuntulog was supposed to be my backup OS... I am running gentoo now and I kill it often (testing 64 bit versions). I need something that works out of the box. That and I need a laptop OS :)
[12:35] <lupine_85> not sure? I came into the conversation halfway through so don't know what card/etc :)
[12:35] <noelferreira> rt61 ralink
[12:35] <noelferreira> mine
[12:35] <what_if> BadKitty: yep openSuSE.. 10.1 (64bit)
[12:35] <noelferreira> i had it working for a while lupine_85
[12:35] <lupine_85> so it's stopped working?
[12:35] <noelferreira> you gave me a command that worked fine
[12:36] <noelferreira> sudo iwconfig wlan0 ap xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[12:36] <lupine_85> "sudo iwconfig wlan0 ap <mac address>" ?
[12:36] <lupine_85> that's it :)
[12:36] <noelferreira> bur when i restarted
[12:36] <noelferreira> ya lupine_85
[12:36] <BadKitty> what_if: cool, I want to try some other linux distros too.. just need more computers!
[12:36] <noelferreira> that's it
[12:36] <lupine_85> oh, I remember now - you couldn't get a DHCP lease
[12:36] <LjL> perhaps that should be set in /etc/network/interfaces noelferreira
[12:36] <klassicd> I have a handler file located in ~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/handlers but it isn't selectable from the deskbar preferences menu even though it appears
[12:36] <noelferreira> ya
[12:36] <noelferreira> but i did that
[12:36] <lupine_85> LjL: sometimes these drivers don't like that
[12:36] <klassicd> anyone know why?
[12:37] <LjL> lupine_85, i see
[12:37] <klassicd> i have chmod +x the handlername.py file
[12:37] <lupine_85> they also don't like scanning before the interface is "up", and all sorts of other weird stuff
[12:37] <noelferreira> so what should i have in /etc/network/interfacer?
[12:37] <lupine_85> but they're Free, so who cares? ;)
[12:37] <lord_nelson> problem playing video and audio files in samba
[12:37] <LjL> lupine_85: well, there's the "up" command in /etc/network/interfaces that IIRC is executed *after* the interface is brought up
[12:38] <lupine_85> noelferreira: I would just have "auto wlan0 \n iface wlan0 inet dhcp" and use rutilt to configure it
[12:38] <noelferreira> ok
[12:38] <lupine_85> rutilt /should/ be in edgy, but the build died on their servers (grr)... are you on i386?
[12:38] <lupine_85> !info rutilt edgy
[12:38] <ubotu> Package rutilt does not exist in edgy
[12:38] <lupine_85> see :'(
[12:38] <noelferreira> amd64
[12:38] <macsim> I got bad fonts (very ugly) with gtk1 apps, fonts transcoded doesn't fix the problem, what's the fix please ?
[12:38] <temba> any1 of you knows a good HOWTO , how i add quota on my ubuntu-server. sorry i am new to ubuntu and to linux. but a bit into it now. so a good howto would suiteme
[12:38] <compengi> is there any program capabil of transfering dvd to vcd?
[12:38] <lupine_85> ok, bear with me and i'll upload you a package
[12:39] <lord_nelson>  problem playing video and audio files in samba
[12:39] <stefan> compengi: I have not idea, but did you try transcode?
[12:39] <temba> samba in mettmann
[12:39] <skymt0> macsim: gtk1 is just ugly. you can improve things a little by installing gtk-theme-switch, and getting some gtk1 themes from gnome-look.org
[12:39] <macsim> skymt0: ok thx
[12:40] <tag> I'm having mad troubles with nis, I keep getting YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound
[12:40] <tag> I can't seem to find much in a way of logs for ypbind
[12:40] <Akuma_> where can i configure gnome terminal's prompt?
[12:40] <noelferreira> sorry lupine_85
[12:40] <noelferreira> i didn't understand
[12:40] <tag> so I don't even know what it's faliing on
[12:40] <tag> Akuma_: that's not gnome, thats your shell
[12:40] <lord_nelson> this help channel is lame
[12:40] <lupine_85> "rutilt" is an application for configuring ralink drivers
[12:40] <tag> Akuma_: and by configuring your shell.
[12:40] <LjL> Akuma_: .bashrc
[12:40] <lupine_85> I'm going to build it for you
[12:40] <tag> LjL: only if they use bash
[12:41] <LjL> tag: which is the ubuntu default, so yes
[12:41] <Akuma_> tag: LjL:  thanks
[12:41] <geokok> hi. I cannot see the names of files and folders from a cd I burned in windows. The names are in greek but the language is installed in my edgy system
[12:41] <lupine_85> Once someone in #ubuntu-motu gets around to applying a patch I've submitted, the exact same package will be in the repos :)
[12:41] <LjL> geokok, i suspect that might be because Windows uses UTF-16 while Linux uses UTF-8 for character encoding
[12:41] <emmettshear_> Hi - I want to apt-get install mtasc, but I think I need to add a server to my sources.list. I found the package referenced at http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/mtasc. How do I translate that to a line in sources.list?
[12:41] <stefan> geokok: different Codepage propably
[12:42] <tag> fucking NIS
[12:42] <LjL> !language | tag
[12:42] <ubotu> tag: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:42] <geokok> Any workarounds? cause we r talking about a huge number of mp3's
[12:42] <Shaezsche> i installed Gnome network manager from automatix and i accidently removed the systray icon! how do i get it back? i cannot find it in the menus
[12:42] <delight> crimsun: well it does not look to good ... on first little googling i did not find any resolution
[12:42] <tag> bah whatever.
[12:42] <skymt0> emmettshear_: don't add a debian repo to sources.list. it causes problems. just download the .deb from the page you linked to
[12:42] <lupine_85> geokok: rebuild with UDF data structures? mount with "nls=(appropriate-codepage)"?
[12:42] <crimsun> delight: "first googling"?
[12:42] <stefan> LjL: does Windows really use UTF-16
[12:42] <noelferreira> thanks lupine_85
[12:43] <noelferreira> and where i download the package
[12:43] <noelferreira> ?
[12:43] <lupine_85> skymt0: even better, steal the .dsc file etc
[12:43] <emmettshear_> skymt0: ok, I don't see the deb on the page...I'll look for it though
[12:43] <LjL> stefan, i don't really really know, but i'm quite sure it doesn't normally use UTF-8
[12:43] <lupine_85> noelferreira: one minute
[12:43] <noelferreira> ok
[12:43] <noelferreira> ok
[12:43] <emmettshear_> oh, I see
[12:43] <emmettshear_> in the big "download" section
[12:43] <LjL> stefan, perhaps it's just using the ISO-whatever table for greek
[12:43] <geokok> lupine_85: can u be explicit about the command to be issued
[12:43] <stefan> LjL: that`s what I thought as well
[12:44] <geokok> LjL: I burned using ashampoo burner software if that helps
=== [itrebal]  is now known as itrebal
[12:45] <delight> crimsun yes i googled + wiki first ... but can't find no worthfulll info on this
[12:45] <stefan> geokok: can you set any ISO standards there?
[12:45] <delight> seems to me like x600 is working on high res only with fglrx
[12:45] <nuts> heyas
[12:45] <lupine_85> noelferreira: the .deb is at http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/rutilt_0.12-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb
[12:45] <itrebal> has anyone set up a bzflag-server?
[12:45] <lupine_85> download it somewhere then sudo dpkg -i rutilt_0.12-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb
[12:45] <nuts> how would I launch rxvt to use a specified font? I tried "rxvt -fn monospace"
[12:45] <crimsun> delight: it doesn't work period without fglrx
[12:45] <nuts> but that doesnt work
[12:46] <lupine_85> geokok: "mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 -o nls=(appropriate-codepage)"
[12:46] <delight> crimsun i guess the opensource driver needs some more development ... it works thou but not on high res
[12:46] <geokok> stafan: no option for language- encoding there
[12:47] <geokok> lupine_85: what would the appropriate codepage be in my case?
[12:47] <MicrosoftSpy> Why is Ubuntu considered a 'newbie' OS ? you can do anything on Ubuntu that Debian can do, can't you ?
[12:47] <geokok> lupine_85: do i have to unmount first?
[12:47] <sonicchao> !ntfs
[12:47] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[12:47] <skymt0> MicrosoftSpy: yes, but it's easier ;)
[12:47] <johny5> Is there anyway to recover a file that was deleted from /.Trash?
[12:47] <sonicchao> johny5, no.
[12:48] <johny5> sonicchao: thanks
[12:48] <itrebal> i bet you could with some really intense filesystem work, but no garentees
[12:48] <skymt0> johny5: yes, but it's hard. if you use the default ext3 fs, check out http://linux.sys-con.com/read/117909.htm
[12:48] <sonicchao> Hm
[12:48] <lupine_85> geokok: "I don't know", and "yes", respectively
[12:49] <sonicchao> I've always been told when it's deleted it's gone.
[12:49] <johny5> skymt0: Thanks
[12:49] <MicrosoftSpy> sky....Hmmm I'd rather have an OS that was both powerful and easy to use...
[12:49] <lupine_85> for the former, #windows might be able to help
[12:49] <lupine_85> johny5: in ext3, not really
[12:49] <nuts> how would I launch rxvt to use a specified font? I tried "rxvt -fn monospace" but that didnt work :((( plz
[12:49] <shwag> how do I list all the files in a package I installed ?
[12:49] <lupine_85> MicrosoftSpy: use OS/2 then
[12:49] <LjL> lupine_85, sure "nls" is the right one? i only saw it in relation with smbfs... instead for iso9660 i've google a "iocharset=<blah>" option, and also a strange thing that goes like "iso9660 <charset>"
[12:49] <aboutblank> dumb question: i just started Beryl with "beryl-manager" in a shell, how do I stop it?
[12:49] <Crankymonky> MicrosoftSpy, Ubuntu fails in your aspirations in which way?  Ease of use or power?
[12:50] <LjL> lupine_85: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-br/2006-May/007445.html
[12:50] <johny5> Ok, Thanks everyone!
[12:50] <shwag> MicrosoftSpy: you dont do much technical work do you?
[12:50] <lupine_85> aboutblank: killall beryl beryl-xgl emerald beryl-manager
[12:50] <bitchslapper> hey people, can't get my Dell 1500 Wireless card to work, I installed ndiswrapper, installed the driver, ndiswrapper -l says that I have the hardware present ... iwconfig still says no extensions .. what do I do next?
[12:50] <lupine_85> LjL: might be. I've never used the option myself
[12:50] <MicrosoftSpy> lupine...Uhhh u can't buy OS2 anymore :)
[12:50] <LjL> geokok: greek ISO table should be ISO 8859-7
[12:50] <lupine_85> :p
[12:51] <lupine_85> you can't buy Windows 98 any more either, but that never stopped me
[12:51] <Crankymonky> MicrosoftSpy, OS/2 I hear is very counter-intuitive, the source being mikm[laptop] 
[12:51] <lupine_85> not that I use windows at all any more
[12:51] <MicrosoftSpy> Cranky....Neither, me likes Ubuntu :)
[12:51] <ailean> how do i get access to the source code, change it, and resubmit it for approval?
[12:51] <harm_> i installed vsftpd on my box but i cant upload to it.. i keep getting 550
[12:51] <Crankymonky> oh, haha MicrosoftSpy
[12:51] <mikm[laptop] > Crankymonky- Not me.  ___mikem
[12:52] <Crankymonky> mikm[laptop] , You sure?  I thought it was you who said that this morning
[12:52] <Crankymonky> or afternoon
[12:52] <MicrosoftSpy> shwag...Hmmmm depends on your definition of 'technical work', if you mean write your own kernel in 30mins then no.....I don't do much technical work
[12:52] <LjL> ailean: to get the source code, "apt-get source <packagename>". to change it, well, just change it. to build it, look at dpkg-buildpackage. as for submitting it, perhaps ask in #ubuntu-motu
[12:52] <shwag> MicrosoftSpy: how about compile your own kernel?
[12:52] <mikm[laptop] > Crankymonky- Almost positive.  I used OS/2 once many years ago
[12:52] <ailean> thanks LjL - where would the source be stored?
[12:52] <Crankymonky> And you said it was "counter-intuitive, if I recall"
[12:52] <ailean> LjL, i.e. on my computer
[12:52] <Crankymonky> no?
[12:52] <LjL> ailean: in the directory you type that apt-get command in
[12:52] <itrebal> compiling kernels isn't what defines "technical work"
[12:53] <Jaak> is there a howto nvidia driver for 6.10 anywhere?
[12:53] <MicrosoftSpy> shwag......Have done it under RH.....but pretty new to Debian
[12:53] <nuts> how would I launch rxvt to use a specified font? I tried "rxvt -fn monospace" but that didnt work :((( plz what am I doing wrong?
[12:53] <lupine_85> "routine administration" ? :)
[12:53] <ailean> LjL, great, thanks
[12:53] <harm_> i installed vsftpd on my box but i cant upload to it.. i keep getting 550
[12:53] <itrebal> harm_: have you forwarded all the ports necissary?
[12:53] <shwag> MicrosoftSpy: i havent compiled my own kernel in atleast a year. Default works fine now...didnt used to be that way. Things are getting better and better every day.
[12:54] <lupine_85> Jaak: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) nvidia-glx && nvidia-glx-config enable should do the trick
[12:54] <lupine_85> ...in arch linux :p
[12:54] <MicrosoftSpy> So true shwag......I bought a new PC yesterday, AMD 4800+...Ubuntu 64 rocks
[12:54] <Jaak> nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-config don't together

[12:56] <gnat_x> does anyone know a repository that would have an updated version of dom inspector for firefox2 / edgy.... firefox-dom-inspector: Depends: firefox (= 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-0ubuntu3) but 2.0+0dfsg-0ubuntu3 is installed.
[12:56] <geokok> LjL: i think i messed uo mount command....take a look http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31568/

[12:57] <LjL> geokok: yeah, there's certainly no spaces in the codepage name
[12:57] <philis> anyone able to help me real quick?
[12:57] <preaction> !ask > philis
[12:58] <LjL> geokok: try "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 -o nls=iso8859-7" or something like that (perhaps a hyphen after the "iso")
[12:58] <gnat_x> crimsun: oh, i think i might see what's up... its bad that the line in etc/apt/sources.list that you are just supposed to uncomment still points to dapper.
[12:58] <LjL> geokok: or "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 -o charset=iso8859-7" (again, with or without a hyphen)

[12:58] <nuts> where are the fonts located in ubuntu????!
[12:58] <gnat_x> crimsun: its safe to just switch dapper with edgy
[12:58] <variant> nuts: /usr/share/fonts/
[12:58] <phoenix_> COuld someone help me with vpn on edgy ?
[12:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell nuts about fonts
[12:59] <jeff_> hey guys
[12:59] <crimsun> gnat_x: I presume you've already dist-upgraded to edgy?
[12:59] <harm_> itrebal yes ports are forwarded
[12:59] <jeff_> :( i suck at life
[12:59] <jeff_> i need help
[12:59] <jeff_> but i'll ask later
[12:59] <itrebal> harm_: which ones have you forwarded?
[12:59] <funkyHat> What's up with gnome-look.org? :S
[12:59] <geokok> LjL: last one did it but the characters are still not readable :(
[12:59] <crimsun> jeff_: sorry, #ubuntu can't help with life.
[12:59] <harm_> itrebal but somewhere in the config i think i need to edit it so that ftp login users have 777 permission?
[12:59] <jeff_> lol crimsun
[12:59] <gnat_x> crimsun: it was a fresh install
[12:59] <jeff_> thanks :/
[12:59] <phoenix_> I follwed all the steps on http://www.dailytechnology.net/how_to_setup_vpn_in_ubunty_edgy_eft.php
[12:59] <variant> geokok: what language is it?
[12:59] <caveMan_> in Screen resolution preference I can only chose 50 and 54 Hz. 50 is selected but the actual refresh rate is 85 Hz. how can I have it show 85 Hz? this is messing up vsync in xgl because xgl believe my actual refresh rate is 50 Hz
[12:59] <harm_> itrebal 21 :)
[12:59] <crimsun> gnat_x: of...dapper?
[12:59] <geokok> variant: greek
[01:00] <phoenix_> but I dont see where to access the gnome network manager
[01:00] <gnat_x> crimsun: of edgy.
[01:00] <variant> geokok: if it was not properly encoded then it wont matter what language support you use. windows has done that to me a few times
[01:00] <LjL> geokok: unmount and try again with the hyphen as well. or try with "utf16" instead of isowhatever
[01:00] <jeff_> I am having huge performance issues with dapper
[01:00] <itrebal> harm_: you also need about a thousand other ports for passive mode
[01:00] <jeff_> things are so laggy
[01:00] <MicrosoftSpy> Ohh bugger my Feisty Fawn install doesn't work.....
[01:00] <philis> I was updating ubuntu from dapper to edgy and I walked away around right before it was goin to be clearing unecessery files I come back in 30 minutes and my laptop was shutdown I try to boot and it justs give a black screen till it idles then it opens up busybox
[01:00] <jeff_> I installed the latest nvidia drivers & the latest kernal, and things just run slow
[01:00] <jeff_> in dapper
[01:00] <harm_> itrebal to upload i need more ports forwarded?
[01:00] <nuts> LjL: can u tell me how to run rxvt to automatically be set to the monospace font? rxvt -fn ... !??!
[01:00] <itrebal> harm_: i believe thats what passive mode is for
[01:00] <LjL> nuts: i haven't the slightest idea
[01:00] <jeff_> can anyone help me with some questions i have???
[01:01] <gnat_x> crimsun: anyway... i updated my source.list, and it all worked out.
[01:01] <harm_> itrebal so which ports should i forward to be able to upload?
[01:01] <jeff_> Someone who knows dapper pretty well
[01:01] <crimsun> gnat_x: right, so it was an outdated universe line. (And why did you have a dapper line on a fresh edgy install anyway?)
[01:01] <variant> jeff_: just ask
[01:01] <phoenix_> vpn help, please  =)
[01:02] <itrebal> harm_: i beleive the standard passive ports are 1024 - 65535.. but thats a few too many so i forwarded 60000 - 65535
[01:02] <geokok> LjL: OMG its even worse now the folder disspapears when i hover over it and letters are all messed up again
[01:02] <geokok> LjL: that is with utf16
[01:02] <jeff_> Err
[01:02] <jeff_> i got kicked
[01:02] <gnat_x> crimsun: it was already there.
[01:02] <sn0n> quick question, is there a way to delete my winxp partition and append it to the "end" of the ubuntu partition?  :-X
[01:02] <jeff_> :/
[01:02] <harm_> itrebal you sure i need to forward that many? and if i do i wont get 550 anymore?
[01:02] <itrebal> harm_: i'm nat terribly familiar with vsftpd... one moment
[01:03] <philis> basically I just want to know if there is a way to preserve any of my files cause I just realised though I backed up my pics i forgot to backup some school assignments
[01:03] <gnat_x> crimsun: in the section where it says uncomment these to include universe.
[01:03] <itrebal> harm_: i was having the same error, i believe
[01:03] <noelferreira> tas ai lupine_85
[01:03] <gnat_x> crimsun: so i uncommented assuming it would point to the right repository.
[01:03] <geokok> variant, LjL: perhaps there is some way to correct the problem on windows before burning the files so that edgy can read them?
[01:03] <noelferreira> sorry lupine_85
[01:03] <lupine_85> ?
[01:03] <noelferreira> are you there lupine_85 now in english
[01:04] <noelferreira> :)
[01:04] <harm_> itrebal ok i hate forwarding more then the minimal amount of ports
[01:04] <lupine_85> I am :)
[01:04] <gnat_x> anyway, i have another universe question... i'm not seeing msttcorefonts in there, and wonder if it has a diff package name now.
[01:04] <noelferreira> i was away
[01:04] <itrebal> harm_: i know, me too
[01:04] <noelferreira> i installed rtutil

[01:05] <ubuntuNOOB> Hello
[01:05] <LjL> geokok: hm, look, try just the "utf8" option perhaps
[01:05] <sn0n> quick question, is there a way to delete my winxp partition and append it to the "end" of the ubuntu partition? ?
[01:05] <ubuntuNOOB> how do I install my ati drivers ?
[01:05] <lupine_85> hopefully, that'll help
[01:05] <ubuntuNOOB> !ati
[01:05] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:05] <lupine_85> sn0n: not really
[01:05] <LjL> geokok: without any other charset option
[01:05] <noelferreira> /usr/share/ lupine_85?
[01:05] <sn0n> thnx lupine_85    :-(
[01:05] <itrebal> pasv_enable ; pasv_max_port=65535 ; pasv_min_port=60000 (each on a new line) i think that is what you need, but i'm not extremly knowledgable with FTPd's and this is what fixed mine
[01:05] <phoenix_> gee, thanks everyone!
[01:05] <lupine_85> noelferreira: ?
[01:06] <harm_> add that whole line in vsftpd.conf?
[01:06] <sn0n> i just spent the last couple weeks setting up ubuntu, and realized that.. :: sigh :: 100 gb is still a windows partition..
[01:06] <sn0n> :-/
[01:06] <noelferreira> where is it lupine_85?
[01:06] <harm_> sec
[01:06] <lupine_85> oh, d'oh
[01:06] <itrebal> harm_: yes - but each part (separated by " ; ") on a new line
[01:06] <jeff_> QUICK QUESTION: I am on dapper. Edgy sucked performance wise, and dapper still sucks. I have the latest nvidia drivers and they helped, but just a little bit. Things are still slow and i dont know why, if someone could help that'd be great. 2.4ghz 1gb ram system, 80gb partition.
[01:06] <bruenig> sn0n, reformat it and make it a storage partition
[01:06] <lupine_85> should be /usr/bin
[01:06] <geokok> LjL: this "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 -o nls=utf8" does not work at all....
[01:06] <sn0n> lupine_85, what about deleting the partition and making it like.. /usr/rob/second
[01:06] <sn0n> would that work?
[01:06] <lupine_85> just drop the './' - so "gksdudo rutilt"
[01:06] <MicrosoftSpy> jeff....Feisty Fawn ?
[01:06] <wastrel> performance in what?
[01:06] <Tater> hey all I had to do an install of ubuntu using my pc for my laptop as my laptop has no cd or floppy drive
[01:06] <lupine_85> sn0n: sure, but it'd still be in the same place on the hard disc
[01:06] <LjL> geokok, no, "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 -o utf8"
[01:06] <itrebal> harm_: http://www.flix.co.il/showVideo.asp?m=1003360 check that out
[01:07] <jeff_> Microsoftspy, Is Feisty Fawn a crappier version of Dapper?
[01:07] <Tater> Anyways how do I rerun the xconfig script?
[01:07] <sn0n> lupine_85, thats fine, i just want access. LoL
[01:07] <itrebal> harm_: woops, not that link :) https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-3-Manual/ref-guide/s1-ftp-vsftpd-conf.html that one
[01:07] <bruenig> !xconfig | Tater
[01:07] <ubotu> Tater: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[01:07] <MicrosoftSpy> jeff....No thats HUMPING PUPPY
[01:07] <Tater> thanks
[01:07] <noelferreira> lupine_85: what i shoul do with wmaster?
[01:07] <noelferreira> nothing?
[01:07] <riddlebox> I get this error, powernow-k8: failing targ, change pending bit set?
[01:07] <jac> jeff_,  feisty fawn is the next release of ubuntu
[01:07] <philis> Ok i just booted up a liveCD of edgy but I can't seem to figure out were it would hide my files on my HD
[01:07] <geokok> LjL: U did it mate!!!
[01:08] <lupine_85> nothign at all
[01:08] <noelferreira> only wlan0
[01:08] <noelferreira> ok

[01:08] <lupine_85> Jaak: in command mode, :w
[01:08] <bruenig> Jaak, or actually just :W
[01:08] <lupine_85> snap :)
[01:08] <sn0n> vi tutorial ftw  :-X
[01:09] <sn0n> real men use notepad.. err.. gedit
[01:09] <geokok> LjL: thanks...got to go set up my mp3 collection! a million thanks!!!
[01:09] <bimberi> philis: you need to mount the hard drive partition
[01:09] <noelferreira> lol
[01:09] <bruenig> real men use echo text > filename.txt and then to edit just use sed
[01:09] <noelferreira> segmentation fault lupine_85
[01:09] <sn0n> LoL
[01:09] <sn0n> EOF   ftw
[01:09] <philis> ahh I need to mount it
[01:09] <harm_> itrebal i have write-enabled = yes uncommented :S
[01:09] <philis> makes sense
[01:09] <MicrosoftSpy> sn0n.... nano ?
[01:09] <sn0n> i like nano and pico and company
[01:09] <sn0n> but i use gedit for everything
[01:09] <sn0n> lol
[01:10] <sn0n> but when i gotta do small things on my website
[01:10] <noelferreira> what should i do lupine_85?
[01:10] <sn0n> i ssh and nano
[01:10] <crass> does anyone know where there is an ubuntu repository that has the latest mplayer?
[01:10] <bruenig> crass, what version is the latest?
[01:10] <harm_> sn0n tried vi yet?
[01:10] <sn0n> i've tried it.. yes.. but im a GUI person
[01:10] <sn0n> aka : user
[01:10] <sn0n> not a coder / hacker
[01:11] <harm_> sn0n :S cli is just that much nicer imho
[01:11] <sn0n> althou i do a lil cpp and php stuff..
[01:11] <crass> bruenig: actually, I should say newer than the universe, preferably updated from cvs regularly
[01:11] <harm_> sn0n Gui's should b web based or for gaming
[01:11] <sn0n> LoL
[01:11] <sn0n> agreed
[01:11] <sn0n> and in 3 yrs.. it will be
[01:11] <bruenig> crass, not sure, is there any reason why you need the latest?
[01:11] <harm_> sn0n i doubt it.. 99% of the people dont know what CLI is :)
[01:11] <clop> hi, will the apt-gotten mplayer be able to use lirc?
[01:12] <sn0n> only front end there will be, will be a tabbed browser
[01:12] <Jaak> if i aptget nvidia-glx should it change my xorg.conf and change nv to nvidia?
[01:12] <Jaak> why doesn't that happen
[01:12] <harm_> sn0n yah well ajax is giong to kick ass
[01:12] <sn0n> going to?  LoL.. it already is.. hehehe
[01:12] <crass> bruenig: usually the mplayer people don't like offering support for non-latest cvs code
[01:12] <crass> and I'm having an issue where mplayer is segfaulting
[01:12] <noelferreira> lupine_85: iwlist scanning returns no wireless available
[01:13] <riddlebox> do I need the powernow-k8 if I have a 32bit processor?
[01:13] <sn0n> know whats funny.. the fact that the parts for ajax had been around for ages.. but only when google labs had "google suggest" did people start really using it..
[01:13] <sn0n> lol
[01:13] <harm_> sn0n well i hope linux is going to take over africa and asia
[01:13] <sn0n> and it got "the name"
[01:13] <itrebal> harm_: did that work, though?
[01:14] <harm_> itrebal forgot 2 restart service sec
[01:14] <itrebal> ah, ok
[01:14] <sn0n> eh, i live in the US
[01:14] <sn0n> where MS owns half of congress
[01:14] <delight> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver says full 2D acceleration for X600 / rv380 based cards ... how come it does not work right with resolutions higher then 1024 ? wouldn't call that full 2D support
[01:14] <sn0n> and can pwn the other half
[01:14] <harm_> sn0n i live in the netherlands where half our congress is bitching at the other half and nothing gets done.. ever
[01:15] <sn0n> lol
[01:15] <tom47> democracy ... the best goverment money can buy
[01:15] <harm_> tom47 agreed lol
[01:15] <jac> sn0n,  well dell owns the prez ;)
[01:15] <guigouz> doesn't ubuntu have an iptables init.d script ?
[01:15] <tom47> prob off-topic though
[01:15] <guigouz> how should I start my firewall at boot ?
[01:16] <sn0n> hehe
[01:16] <riddlebox> can someone help with with the powernowd?
[01:16] <sn0n> i just got done making 500 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Ubuntu_leaflet.pdf
[01:16] <bimberi> guigouz: no, there is no firewalling by default - and no ports listening
[01:16] <sn0n> for a personal push at work..
[01:16] <sn0n> im converting all my co-workers  :-D
[01:16] <Jimbo> whats the command to remove a directory?
[01:16] <guigouz> bimberi, I just setup some iptables rules, any standard way of making them run at boot ?
[01:16] <crass> bimberi: is there a preferred place to hooking iptables stuff?
[01:16] <sn0n> rm -rf /dirname
[01:17] <Jimbo> sn0n thax
[01:17] <lupine_85> guigouz: iptables-save and iptables-restore
[01:17] <sn0n> Jimbo, and if your asking that question.. you should right click, delete
[01:17] <sn0n> ;-)
[01:17] <bimberi> guigouz: i'm not sure really.  I've simply installed and used shorewall to do it
[01:17] <sn0n> sorry,. "move to trash"
[01:17] <lupine_85> called from /etc/rc2.d somewhere, and saving the file to /etc/iptables.conf I guess
[01:17] <Jimbo> that didnt work ...r clik delete no worky
[01:17] <harm_> sn0n nice work on taht pdf
[01:17] <sn0n> i didnt make it
[01:17] <shwag> this would be a nice package to have in universe.  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45693
[01:17] <sn0n> i just printed it
[01:17] <sn0n> lol
[01:17] <bimberi> crass: ^^^
[01:17] <guigouz> lupine_85, but that doesn't include any init script.
[01:18] <crass> lupine_85: yeah, but that's kinda hackish
[01:18] <sn0n> crass, Linux is kinda hackish still..
[01:18] <hikenboot> hello all I have added a samba share to my computer in order to access it from the windows computer... I see the share it prompts me for a password to go along with the username ..I put in my password and it doesnt take it ...I have reset it twice ..no cap loc problem either...any ideaS?
[01:18] <shwag> what is Bazaar ?
[01:18] <philis> ok noob question I can't figure how to mount my hard drive right now, I thought I could do it from Gparted but I couldnt figure it out
[01:18] <crass> sn0n: just because there are bad practices in use, doesn't mean we should perpetuate them
[01:19] <sn0n> sry  :-x
[01:19] <sn0n> hehe
[01:19] <harm_> hikenboot in a terminal say man smbclient
[01:19] <sn0n> old windows habits  :-X
[01:19] <Jimbo> i dont kno if its me or what cus lot of stuff im told just plain wont work
[01:19] <shwag> philis: mounting is done from the CLI
[01:19] <harm_> hikenboot i mean smbpasswd
[01:19] <tom47> Jimbo what is the error message on r click "no worky"
[01:19] <philis> ok
[01:19] <bimberi> shwag: a distributed version control system
[01:19] <harm_> hikenboot you need to create a new samba login and password :)
[01:19] <Jimbo> there is no error message...move to trash is greyed out
[01:19] <napalm> hello
[01:19] <crass> guigouz: I've had the same question, let me know if you find the/an answer please
[01:19] <Jimbo> ive been trying to mount a drive again all day withno luck
[01:20] <hikenboot> sudo smbpasswd -L -a hikenboot
[01:20] <tom47> jimbo what is the file (incl director details) THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DELETE?
[01:20] <Jimbo> now im tryin to clean up the mess and start over
[01:20] <guigouz> crass, I found some workaround
[01:20] <hikenboot> enter password twice...still wont take it
[01:20] <wastrel> Jimbo:  permissions problem/
[01:20] <wastrel> ?, even
[01:20] <guigouz> crass, I added a script to /etc/network/if-up.d
[01:20] <Jimbo> its called hdb1 and it ended up in the wrong place
[01:20] <harm_> hikenboot sudo smbpasswd ?
[01:20] <guigouz> crass, http://pastebin.ca/247933
[01:20] <tom47> jimbo apologies for caps
[01:20] <Jimbo> when trying to mkdir to mout a drive
[01:20] <hikenboot> no it takes it but the windows client wont accept it as the correct one
[01:21] <guigouz> crass, the comments are in portuguese, but that's just a simple firewall script.
[01:21] <Jimbo> permissions problem?
[01:21] <SilentDis> hello :)
[01:21] <harm_> dudes iam going to sleep i set up a server box via SSH for a friend, starting w. 5.04 i went to 6.06 and installed apache php mysql samba teamspeak and ftp :
[01:21] <crass> guigouz: thanks, I've got my own script, just wondering the "official" way to plug it in
[01:21] <lupine_85> guigouz: you'd write the init script yourself....
[01:21] <Tater> hey all I'm having trouble getting ubuntu to see my wireless card on my laptop any ideas its pcmcia
[01:22] <guigouz> crass, I added it to /etc/network/if-up.d
[01:22] <tom47> Jimbo it sounds like you do not have the right level of permissions to allow you to delete the file
[01:22] <crass> guigouz: yeah, thanks, I'll look in there
[01:22] <hikenboot> harm_ does the samba computer name have to be the same name as the host?

[01:23] <Tater> crass I doubt it last time ubuntu auto detected it
[01:23] <crass> Tater: last time being when you installed?
[01:23] <jeff_> QUICK QUESTION: (BACKROUND INFO:) I originally installed edgy as my first install and i couldnt get the performance to work at all. so I went back to Dapper. It still pretty much sucks, I installed the latest kernel and the most recent nvidia drivers and it's just laggy...like a OS starting to crap out...I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions/comments? 2.4ghz, 1gb ram P4 on 80gb HD
[01:23] <Tater> crass well the last time I did an install it detected it, I just reinstalled
[01:24] <crass> Tater: run the install cd in live mode, and see what module its using
[01:24] <slimz> hey guys, i got an error on reboot starting X, saying ; API Mismatch, the nvidia kernel module has the version 1.08, but this X module has the version 1.09
[01:24] <slimz> any ideas?
[01:24] <Tater> crass can't the laptop has no cd drive or floppy disk, the install was done by pulling the hdd out of the laptop and hooking it into my desktop pc
[01:25] <slimz> and i forgot how to install my mouse for command line :
[01:25] <slimz> :
=== Crankymonky is now known as ___mikem
[01:25] <probose> well, when i delete something in my Mp3 player, it somehow still there, in a folder called /.Trash-probose. So how do i totally format the mp3 player?
[01:25] <boozey> is there anyway to setup apache in home user folder instead of using install apt that installs in root folders
[01:25] <flodine> anyone use gmpc here that can help me reconfigure it to work like in dapper
=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as ____mikem
[01:25] <crass> Tater: then it didn't detect any wireless card on your laptop, since it was being run from the desktop
[01:25] <Tater> crass, yup I need to get it to work though any ideas on what I can do
[01:25] <apokryphos-> boozey: apache is very very configurable. Have a look at the apache documentation and look around in /etc/apache2. All the config files are there.
[01:25] <Jimbo> it seems some commands do absolutely nothing...i cant be getting them all wrong
[01:26] <Jimbo> what was this permissions thing mentioned?
[01:26] <crass> Tater: look at output of lspci or lshw to see vendor/model info for the card, if you can
[01:26] <probose> well, when i delete something in my Mp3 player, it somehow still there, in a folder called /.Trash-probose. So how do i totally format the mp3 player?
[01:26] <SilentDis> !permissions > Jimbo
[01:26] <boozey> apokryphos- can i set it for users to manage there site in there home directory?
[01:26] <MicrosoftSpy> I'm sorry the Microsoft help line is now closed due to technical failure.....Please call again later
[01:26] <tom47> Jimbo when a command works it usually says nothing and returns you to the command prompt
[01:27] <Jimbo> !permissions > jimbo
[01:27] <crass> Tater: what is the card?
[01:27] <Jimbo> tom47....doesnt seem that way
[01:27] <Jimbo> i had this all set up yesterday then i loaded automatrix and broke it
[01:27] <jeff_> QUICK QUESTION: (BACKROUND INFO:) I originally installed edgy as my first install and i couldnt get the performance to work at all. so I went back to Dapper. It still pretty much sucks, I installed the latest kernel and the most recent nvidia drivers and it's just laggy...like a OS starting to crap out...I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions/comments? 2.4ghz, 1gb ram P4 on 80gb HD
[01:28] <apokryphos-> boozey: I don't think the default apache will allow you having multiple servers easily, but you can certainly give each user a folder in their home directory that can be linked to in apache homepage
[01:28] <Tater> its a dlink dwl I see Texas instruments ACX 100 listed in lspci
[01:28] <SilentDis> jeff_:  check the nivida faq to make sure you've got the latest binary blob running
[01:28] <guigouz> jeff_, add another user and see if it's  also "lagged"
[01:28] <Jimbo> brb
[01:28] <crass> jeff_: make sure you have enough swap
[01:28] <SilentDis> !nvidia | Jeff_
[01:28] <ubotu> Jeff_: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:28] <philis> I can't figure out how mount it cause it should just be an ext3
[01:28] <jeff_> crass: I don't know what swap is
[01:28] <jeff_> lol
[01:28] <boozey> is it best apokryphos- to install apache on each users directory?
[01:28] <boozey> so they have there own
[01:28] <jeff_> and SilentDis: I don't know how to check to see if i've got the latest binary blob running.
[01:28] <tom47> Jimbo hmmmmm looks like ou are one of those cases where the folk that support ubuntu have reason for recommendng people don't use automatix
[01:29] <jeff_> <----Linux n00b...
[01:29] <SilentDis> jeff_: that's why ubotu sent you that link ;)
[01:29] <jeff_> *ubuntu
[01:29] <apokryphos-> boozey: it depends on what kind of users you plan on having. If you just want to give each user, say, a folder where they can have "their site", then that definitely wouldn't be necessary
[01:29] <SilentDis> !nvidia > jeff_
[01:29] <jeff_> I didnt see anyone send me any link
[01:29] <crass> Tater: google for that card and linux and see if you can find people talking about what driver is needed for it
[01:29] <tom47> !nvidia | jeff_
[01:29] <ubotu> jeff_: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:29] <jeff_> errr, ok
[01:29] <apokryphos-> jeff_: it's a good idea to look through the FAQ, wiki, and user documentation :)
[01:29] <jeff_> ty ubotu
[01:30] <Jimbo> is there something about a fat32  drive that makes it hard to mount? like use vfat or something instead of fat32?
[01:30] <jeff_> im gonna give this a shot
[01:30] <derek_> does anyone here use Frostwire, I have a few questions
[01:30] <crass> Tater: also look at dmesg to see if the kernel says anytthing about it
[01:30] <gonzoism> i'm having problems resolving names in ubuntu.  does anyone know what the problem is ?  i try to use my own named, bind, but also have others listed in resolv.conf and nothing will resolve
[01:30] <Tater> crass word up, then I guess I can just rip out the drive and mount it from my desktop install and copy the needed driver on there
[01:30] <jeff_> i already installed nvidia drivers, though.....
[01:30] <apokryphos-> Jimbo: mount/fstab use "vfat", yes, not fat32
[01:30] <jeff_> i just typed something into my terminal my friend told me to and my nvidia drivers are already running
[01:30] <crass> Tater: yeah, if that's the only way
[01:30] <MicrosoftSpy> d
[01:30] <crass> Tater: it may be that the driver is on there, just not being loaded
[01:30] <tom47> SilentDis hmmm yummy
[01:31] <philis> so I need to mount the ext3 from dapper can someone give me the command for that?
[01:31] <Jimbo> apokryphose you know how the string should go cus i cant seem to get it to work
[01:31] <apokryphos-> philis: check through the faq :)
[01:31] <derek_> frostwire anyone? throw me a bone, please
[01:31] <apokryphos-> Jimbo: which string?
[01:31] <Jimbo> to mount this blasted second hard drive
[01:31] <Tater> crass hmm how would I go about dealing with that though, shouldn't the driver be loaded automagically if the card is detected

[01:31] <ubotu> derek_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:31] <bulmer> how do I set the default resolution? eveytime I do this under Screen Preferences, it kills X and its back to where it was set..nothing on /etc/X11/xorg.conf I can seem to relate
[01:31] <gonzoism> this seems like it has been a problem with ubuntu for a while
[01:32] <tom47> !mount
[01:32] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[01:32] <l0eola> ll-as
[01:32] <crass> Taterusually, but: not always
[01:32] <apokryphos-> bulmer: I'd just remove all other resolutions and leave the one you want
[01:32] <Jimbo> i had i workin good yesterday till i loaded automatrix then everything went to hell and i re installed but only been on linux a couple days and im stuck again
[01:32] <TLE> I'm using Avidemux for video tasks, but how do I prevent it from hogging all the system resources ?
[01:32] <apokryphos-> ubotu: tell Jimbo about automatix
[01:32] <bulmer> apokryphos: okay thanks for the idea
[01:32] <Jimbo> i know boout automatrix nopw
[01:32] <gonzoism> jimbo, what are you wanting to do ?
[01:32] <Jimbo> now
[01:32] <l0eola> #iptables
[01:32] <derek_> well then, I have been trying to use Frostwire and it wont seem to connect, it just says starting connection
[01:32] <apokryphos-> Jimbo: for mounting check the FAQ
[01:32] <Jimbo> mount the drive
[01:33] <bimberi> philis: create a mountpoint (eg. sudo mkdir /mnt/disk) then mount to it 'sudo mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/disk'  (hda3 is a guess)
[01:33] <philis> ok thanks
[01:33] <apokryphos-> !faq
[01:33] <ubotu> faq is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions Official documentation is at http://help.ubuntu.com IRC FAQ: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRCResourcePage

[01:33] <tom47> !automatix | Jimbo
[01:33] <ubotu> Jimbo: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:33] <gonzoism> jimbo mount a drive ?  know which one ?  usually something like mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
=== Vert is now known as looqpglz
[01:34] <Jimbo> gonsoism: hdb1
[01:34] <edoardo> hi everyone! i'm tryin' to install ubuntu for the first time. am a gentoo user. i'm at the partitionin' moment, so i choose the mount points an' everythin', and like... i push forward, and it complains that there ain't no root filesystem. but i put / in one of the boxes!! what's wrong you think? thanks!
=== looqpglz is now known as oo00oo
[01:34] <gonzoism> jimbo  mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
[01:34] <Jimbo> trying to mount it in a folder named hdb1 in filesystem/media
[01:34] <PumpkinPie> is there support for USB nics on "ubuntu server"
[01:34] <edulix> hi
[01:34] <apokryphos-> edoardo: weird, is this edgy?
[01:34] <SilentDis> edoardo: did you choose to format the / partition, as well as the swap partition?
[01:34] <edulix> how can I install /usr/bin/pl for prolog
[01:34] <edulix> ?
[01:34] <TLE> Can it be done with the nice command ?
[01:34] <edoardo> SilentDis i did
[01:34] <bimberi> edoardo: i've had that too - i think it's a bug.  One think I didn't try was making sure that / was the first or last thing in the list
[01:35] <Jimbo> gonzo will that mount it permanently?
[01:35] <edoardo> apokryphos- it's 6.10
[01:35] <edulix> I've done aptitude search prolog but I don't know which package provides it
[01:35] <edoardo> bimberi how'd you solve it?
[01:35] <jeff_> QUESTION: I was told to go download the nvidia drivers by enabling the copy right protection checkbox in the synaptic manager however my GUI is highly inconsistent with the directions and I can't understand why
[01:35] <tom47> Jimbo sudo mkdir /media/hdb1   ... and then sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1
[01:35] <jeff_> i am on dapper 6.06
[01:35] <bimberi> edoardo: i installed dapper and upgraded
[01:35] <bimberi> :/
[01:35] <edoardo> bimberi that is not cool : D
[01:35] <apokryphos-> guys, this manual mounting is really unnecessary :)
=== ____mikem is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[01:36] <SilentDis> jeff_: did you check over the faq page?
[01:36] <apokryphos-> partly because the link on the wiki explains this really well, and secondly because there's an automatic script for it, for new users :)
[01:36] <edoardo> so no one else solved this bug?
[01:36] <bulmer> Jimbo: only if its configured  in the /etc/fstab   to make it permanent
[01:36] <bimberi> edoardo: i was experimenting with edgy at the time.  That PC now just has Dapper anyway
[01:36] <jeff_> SilentDis....the directions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia are just flat out wrong
[01:36] <jeff_> and don't make sense
[01:36] <philis> bimberi: huzzah it works I needed hda1 but i knew that
[01:36] <Jimbo> Tom47": i already got a directory
[01:36] <bimberi> philis: cool :)
[01:36] <SilentDis> jeff_: I'm running dapper myself, with the nvidia-glx driver, and that's the guide I followed.
[01:36] <jeff_> They tell me to click OK and there isnt even an OK button in the task
[01:37] <Jester45> tring the ubuntu channle
[01:37] <Jester45> about 700 more people in it
[01:37] <jeff_> in the Synaptic Package Manager I click settings -> repositories
[01:37] <jeff_> then i click ADD
[01:37] <bimberi> edoardo: like i said, try changing the position of / in the list
[01:37] <jeff_> and there is no OK button
[01:37] <MicrosoftSpy> @find smashing pumpkins tonight
[01:37] <jeff_> although, they tell me to click OK
[01:37] <Jimbo> bulmer  is this the correct way?   http://www.smorgasbord.net/how_to_install_second_hard_drive_ubuntu_linux
[01:37] <oxEz> Hi, before installing Edgy I have a question.. I currently have a gentoo install on my harddrive, with GRUB. Is it possible in the ubuntu installer to not install grub, but to just output the necessary lines to my gentoo's grub config in order to boot ubuntu?
[01:37] <SilentDis> jeff_: let me find it on my machine.
[01:37] <Jimbo> it dont seem to work
[01:37] <Jimbo> grrrr
[01:37] <at0m> how would i go about installing this application>?
[01:37] <jeff_> i need to hit OK to prompt some sort of refresh of my system so it can find the drivers, and it won't work
[01:37] <at0m> b5i2iso
[01:38] <jeff_> ok silentdis
[01:38] <bulmer> Jimbo: what do you mean it does not work? the changes in /etc/fstab does not stick?
[01:38] <Jimbo> ill go fool around and see if I get lucky and something works
[01:38] <bimberi> oxEz: yes, but not with the Desktop (LiveCD) installer.  Use alternate
[01:38] <edoardo> cool. i got the workaround off google
[01:38] <apokryphos-> Jimbo: use the automatic script, maybe :)
[01:38] <tom47> Jimbo just try the commands i gave you and see if they work,  if so, the we can explore where you actually want it
[01:38] <edoardo> delete root partition, re create it. go on
[01:38] <edoardo> : D
[01:38] <edoardo> thanks you guys! : )
[01:38] <apokryphos-> thanks for letting us know =)
[01:38] <bimberi> edoardo: that worked?
[01:38] <apokryphos-> must check if a bug was filed
[01:38] <edoardo> well haven't tried it yet
[01:39] <edoardo> am in another room
[01:39] <SilentDis> jeff_: in synaptic, click Settings > Repositories.  Click the "Add" button on the left.  Check off all the items listed, and hit "Add" at the bottom.  then click "Close" at the bottom.
[01:39] <apokryphos-> MicrosoftSpy: please behave :)
[01:39] <edoardo> talk to ya later!
[01:39] <oxEz> bimberi: Will it just mount my gentoo's /boot partition, and write that to grub/grub.conf ?
[01:39] <bulmer> Jimbo: quick glance on that link you posted, they seem to be okay
[01:39] <MicrosoftSpy> apokryphos....What did I do wrong ?
[01:39] <philis> now that I got my files back I'm wondering if it's possible to keep all my files and just upgrade it
[01:39] <SilentDis> jeff_: synaptic will ask to refresh it's repositories, let it.
[01:39] <Jimbo> hard to keep up with chat when switching back and forth to termina
[01:39] <sn0n> besides being a windows user?   ;-)  jk
[01:39] <jeff_> okay, now i am reloading silentdis
[01:39] <sn0n> i ADORE windows  :-
[01:39] <sn0n> :-)
[01:39] <Jimbo> chat moves too fast for my brain
[01:39] <jeff_> it is downloading...
[01:39] <apokryphos-> MicrosoftSpy: making nonsense posts in the channel.
[01:39] <Tater> How do I get to my grub.conf file ina  deafult ubuntu install
[01:39] <Jimbo> ill try again from that website
[01:40] <tom47> sn0n yeah can look out of em all day
[01:40] <sn0n> hehehe
[01:40] <bulmer> Tater: they are at  /boot/
[01:40] <lupine_85> Tater: /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
[01:40] <bimberi> oxEz: you can tell it that /boot is there, although then it will probably put the Ubuntu kernel's there too
[01:40] <jeff_> SilentDis, okay it seems to have finished up
[01:40] <MicrosoftSpy> apokryphos....Didn't mean to, pasted it into wrong channel.... :( Me Bad
[01:40] <Tater> lupine_85, wicked thanks I wasn't sure what it was called
[01:40] <SilentDis> jeff_: good.  you'll need the nvidia-glx package, as well as the restricted modules for your kernel
[01:40] <jeff_> SilentDis, how do i get those??
[01:40] <bulmer> Tater: they are at  /boot/grub/ rather
[01:40] <oxEz> bimberi: yea I don't care about new files, but I just don't want my own grub.conf to be overwritten (added text is okay though..)
[01:40] <gubuntu> will someone take a look at http://pastebin.ca/247945
[01:40] <gubuntu> are those C00 procs running with whatyever server i have on serial getty?
[01:41] <Jimbo> tom47 gonna go try your commands again brb
[01:41] <jeff_> should i search for nvidia-glx in my Synaptic Package Manager
[01:41] <jeff_> ?
[01:41] <jeff_> and just check everything & install?
[01:41] <SilentDis> jeff_:  you can do a search under synaptic, but when it comes to chat, it's a lot easier if I just walk you through terminal commands (less chance of error) :)
[01:41] <riddlebox> can someone tell me if I need the powernow-k8 running?
[01:41] <bimberi> oxEz: i'm fairly sure it will overwrite.  Probably best to not install grub at all and add Ubuntu lines to your Gentoo grub.conf
[01:41] <jeff_> ok silentdis
[01:41] <jeff_> pls do
[01:42] <bimberi> oxEz: but back it up first :-)
[01:42] <SilentDis> jeff_: in a term window, type uname -r
[01:42] <jeff_> k, done
[01:42] <SilentDis> jeff_: that'll give us your kernel version :)
[01:42] <wastrel> uname -r
[01:42] <jeff_> 2.6.15-27-686
[01:42] <gubuntu> lol, wastrel
[01:42] <SilentDis> jeff_: ok, you're running the 686 kernel.
[01:42] <jeff_> is that alright?
[01:43] <TGPO> anyone know if linux LVM and Windoze LVM play well together?
[01:43] <noelferreira> lupine_85: are you there?
[01:43] <Jimbo> tom47...those commands mounted the drive in media
[01:43] <Jimbo> Tom47, you got one that will make it permanent again?
[01:43] <guilo> hi hi have a problem with my keyboard layout (spanish)  i cant use altgr to use thir level choosers
[01:44] <SilentDis> jeff_: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-686
[01:44] <jeff_> all of that as one big line in my terminal?
[01:44] <SilentDis> jeff_: yep
[01:44] <tom47> Jimbo do you want to explore why they did not work on yr original method?
[01:44] <oxEz> bimberi: How will I figure ubuntu lines ;)
[01:44] <jeff_> nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
[01:44] <jeff_> linux-restricted-modules-686 is already the newest version.
[01:44] <Jimbo> first i want to get it to work
[01:45] <Jimbo> ive been on this all day and im running out of hair
[01:45] <SilentDis> jeff_: that command tells apt (the package manager, apt-get) to get and install the nvidia driver, as well as the restricted modules package
[01:45] <Jimbo> and i got a helluva headach
[01:45] <jeff_> ok cool
[01:45] <tom47> Jimbo hehehehe welcome
[01:45] <bimberi> oxEz: ask here :-)  I can put my (Dapper) /boot/grub/menu.lst on a pastebin if you like
[01:45] <SilentDis> jeff_: that's fine.  we're sure now that they're all installed and working right :)
[01:45] <bulmer> Jimbo: take a little nap..it will do wonders...lol
[01:45] <jeff_> Okay :)
[01:45] <jeff_> then why is my OS still running like a spyware xp box? :(
[01:46] <grndslm> heya...for some reason my mom's computer can boot the live cd, but all of the cds give her errors during install.  is it possible to use a live cd to mount a /, swap, & /home partitions....and apt-get install from scratch that way??
[01:46] <SilentDis> jeff_: next command:  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[01:46] <TGPO> jimbo sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[01:46] <jeff_> k
[01:46] <Jimbo> its personal now....this damn os is getting me mad
[01:46] <[Relic] > :)
[01:46] <jeff_> ok done
[01:46] <oxEz> bimberi: Well, as long as the booting process didn't change between 6.06 -> 6.10 I can take yours :)
[01:46] <Jimbo> tgpo..dont want to install nvidia yet
[01:46] <tom47> Jimbo to make it mount permanently you have to amend the file system table which you can do by using the command sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[01:46] <sn0n> Jimbo, wats the problems ur having?
[01:46] <bulmer> grndslm: you have multiple cd drives?
[01:47] <sbarn> hi everyone, yesterday after SIMPLE DELETING A NETWORK CONNECTION ICON! gnome cd/dvd creator crashed and now anytime I start gnome i get a thounsand bug buddy prompts and no desktop. Anyone know a cure?
[01:47] <SilentDis> jeff_: ok... one last thing, then a reboot.  we're just gonna make SURE the vid driver is right ;)
[01:47] <bimberi> oxEz: ooh, actually I have an Edgy one too ...
[01:47] <emilia> anyone know how to get two ubuntu pcs on a network with shared internet connection, where one ubuntu pc has 2 lan cards? i cant find a how to guide?
[01:47] <Jimbo> tom...entering that command brb
[01:47] <jeff_> okay silentdis
[01:47] <jeff_> BRB
[01:47] <ixian_> does www.gnome-look.org work for anyone here? firefox complains about a bad cookie or something
[01:47] <jeff_> wait, complete reboot or can i just ctrl+alt+backspace?
[01:47] <TLE> Are there stability issues in Edgy? Now I've had both Amule and Avidemux crash on me several times and neither of them has ever done that before
[01:47] <sbarn> and i just want to state how ridiculous that is when people complain about windows' instability..I never had anything like that happen to me. It angers me beyond belief
[01:47] <sn0n> ixian_, works here?
[01:47] <SilentDis> jeff_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:47] <TGPO> jeff ctl alt bkspc
[01:47] <[Relic] > Anyone know of any way to repartion a large section by splitting it in 2 w/o having to delete everything from it to do it?
[01:47] <sn0n> ixian_, scratch ther, dont work
[01:47] <oxEz> bimberi: nice ;)
[01:47] <SilentDis> jeff_:  after we do this command, you should probably reboot, jsut to be TOTALLY sure :)
[01:48] <Jimbo> tom47: i got a text file up now what do i edit?
[01:48] <grndslm> bulmer...nope, she just got it from eBay actually
[01:48] <jeff_> ok
[01:48] <jeff_> now i am configuring xserver.org silentdis
[01:48] <jeff_> in my terminal
[01:48] <bimberi> oxEz: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31571/
[01:48] <ixian_> ok at least i know its not on my end
[01:48] <sn0n> heh
[01:48] <SilentDis> jeff_: i had problems just restarting x with this, for some reason, the damn driver had problems accessing the modules for me till after I rebooted :P
[01:48] <tom47> Jimbo ok you will want a line that looks like ,y next message in it ....
[01:48] <sn0n> http://art.gnome.org/  use that instead.. :-D
[01:48] <Jimbo> this is a fat32 drive
[01:48] <tom47> /dev/hda7       /media/hda7     ext3    defaults        0       2
[01:48] <jeff_> hmmmm
[01:48] <jeff_> so basically if i reboot i might not be able to get back to the chatroom?
[01:48] <sn0n> ixian_, http://art.gnome.org/  use that instead.. :-D
[01:48] <jeff_> lol
[01:48] <bulmer> grndslm: if you only have one cdrom and you are booting of that same for LiveCD you have no other access to a cdrom drive
[01:49] <tom47> Jimbo oh ok hang on
[01:49] <sn0n> jeff_, you can.. just use the LiveCD if X dont work  ;)
=== ___mikem is now known as Crankymonky
[01:49] <oxEz> bimberi: many thanks =) Is there a way to not install GRUB in the Desktop LiveCD or I really have to go through Alternate?
[01:49] <grndslm> bulmer...um, i'm talking about apt-get installing from the internet
[01:49] <jeff_> theres a command (i forget it) and it lets me reconfigure the kernel
[01:49] <SilentDis> jeff_:  great.  usually, you can just follow the prompts along, and it'll find everything for you.  when asked to pick a driver, make SURE you pick the nivida one.  other than that, just carefully read it, and make sure it seems right to you, and ok your way through it :)
[01:49] <grndslm> is there a way to install ubuntu over the net with a livecd?
[01:49] <jeff_> ok silentdis
[01:49] <jeff_> im gonna do that now
[01:49] <grndslm> install cds just won't work for some reason
[01:50] <sbarn> hello, anone know what to do? I am left w/out a desktop basically on ubuntu
[01:50] <jeff_> do i want NVIDIA or NV as my driver???
[01:50] <bimberi> oxEz: alternate.  They wanted as few questions as possible in the Live installer
[01:50] <sn0n> sbarn, explain?
[01:50] <SilentDis> jeff_: nvidia
[01:50] <Jimbo>  /dev/hdb1      /media/hdb1     vfat    defaults        0       2    is this what i need?
[01:50] <jeff_> Enter the amount of memory (in kB) to be used by your video card.
[01:50] <Jimbo> tom47 is this what i need to put in the file?    /dev/hdb1      /media/hdb1     vfat    defaults        0       2
[01:50] <oxEz> bimberi: fine, thanks
[01:51] <emilia> i have two ubuntu pcs, this one is online, the other is on a crossover connection into this one, and when i browse network places, it says windows network?
[01:51] <wileyb> howdy
[01:51] <sbarn> sn0n, i deleted a simple samba connection icon on the desktop and now anytime I start gnome gnome cd/dvd creator crashes w/bug buddy appearing like 5 times and I have no desktop
[01:51] <tom47> Jimbo for a FAT32 you will need this ....   /dev/hda1    /media/windows vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0
[01:51] <SilentDis> jeff_: read that screen, hun.  you'll see that it says right there it can be left blank safely, unless it's some sort of weird integrated card.  if you've got an nvidia card, you're fine with it blank :)
[01:51] <TLE> grndslm: try and have a look here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation#head-e87f88f2cc723e9cfbd1ce8698de949d31004d2c under the advanced section
[01:51] <sn0n> sbarn, define no desktop? and how did you delete it?
[01:51] <tom47> Jimbo with the details adjusted to refelct the actual partition name
[01:51] <bimberi> emilia: yes, i have that too - and mine is a standalone PC
[01:51] <Jimbo> k trying now brb
[01:51] <emilia> bimberi: do you know how to add my other pc there?
[01:52] <sbarn> sn0n, I right clicked it and clicked unmount. Now I just have a white screen and the panel is still present but nothing on the desktop works
[01:52] <jeff_> hey
[01:52] <jeff_> sorry i got kicked
[01:52] <SilentDis> jeff_: no troubles
[01:52] <jeff_> i accidently hit shift+backspace
[01:52] <jeff_> :|
[01:52] <sbarn> i wish gnomes bugzilla showed bugs reported by me, i could have sent u it..
[01:52] <sn0n> sbarn, and Ctrl Alt Backspace does not fix it?
[01:52] <bimberi> emilia: Places -> Connect to Server...
[01:52] <tom47> Jimbo if i remember correctly its /dev/hdb1 and /media/hdb1
[01:52] <jeff_> I got knocked out of the video configuration utility before it was finished, though
[01:52] <jeff_> how can i get back ot it in my terminal?
=== MicrosoftSpy is now known as MrShuttleworth
[01:52] <Shardy> Im having trouble with x11.  I recently got another monitor and it wont start, I was wondering if there is a script I can run that automatically configures x11org.config
[01:52] <SilentDis> jeff_: no problems. run it again.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:53] <Shardy> err x11org.conf
[01:53] <sn0n> Shardy, use your videocard settings (nvidia, etc)
[01:53] <emilia> bimberi :  do you know how to find the ip of it :) ?
[01:53] <sbarn> sn0n, no i've rebooted and everything..gnome's bugzilla said try delting recent-used.xbel for a similar situation but it didnt do anything
[01:53] <jeff_> Enter the amount of memory (in kB) to be used by your video card.
[01:53] <jeff_> SilentDis what should i do here? : Enter the amount of memory (in kB) to be used by your video card.
[01:53] <bimberi> emilia: ifconfig
[01:53] <MrShuttleworth> tom47...Bout 20mill ?
[01:53] <tom47> heheheh
[01:53] <tom47> at least
[01:53] <Shardy> Its the same video card, its just a different monitor, it says It cant find any screens.
[01:54] <SilentDis> jeff_: as I said, read the screen :).  it says that it can be left blank safely.  that's for weirdo shared memory vid cards, which, trust me, you don't have ;)
[01:54] <MrShuttleworth> Are you really 47 Tom ?
[01:54] <sn0n> sbarn, hrmm... try apt-get update | apt-get upgrade     see if that does anything?
[01:54] <tom47> yes
[01:54] <Jimbo> tom47 entered that string guess i need to reboot tosee if it worked huh
[01:54] <tom47> or no as the case may be
[01:54] <jeff_> SilentDis, okay what about this one?: Use kernel framebuffer device interface?
[01:54] <tom47> Jimbo you need to save the file
[01:54] <sn0n> sbarn, im a 'user' myself.. not a veteran.. im half way there  ;-)
[01:54] <SilentDis> jeff_: as the screen says, either will work.  i chose no, and have had no problems :)
[01:54] <tom47> there is a way to do it without rebooting but thats easiest
[01:54] <Jimbo> i saved it
[01:55] <Paddy_EIRE> how to stop sound juicer from automatically assigning ID3 tags to my cd tracks as the ones I'm getting are wrong
[01:55] <Jimbo> brb
[01:55] <sbarn> sn0n, no there
[01:55] <sn0n> Paddy_EIRE, try #sound-juicer ?
[01:55] <sbarn> s no new updates
[01:55] <sbarn> its some gnome bug im guessing
[01:55] <Paddy_EIRE> sn0n: thx
[01:55] <jeff_> should i select all the resolution as options, SilentDis?
[01:55] <emilia> bimberi: im lost :)
[01:55] <sn0n> do a ls ~/.Trash    is the thing you deleted there?
[01:55] <Paddy_EIRE> sn0n: empty unfortunately
[01:55] <emilia> bimberi: if i ever get internet on the other pc itll be a miracle
[01:56] <sn0n> Paddy_EIRE, that was for sbarn, sry
[01:56] <SilentDis> jeff_: they're, again, all explained on that screen.  I enabled them all except one, record (or some such, i didn't want dev output garbage)
[01:56] <johny5> In case anyone is interested, I had limited success recovering my files by unmounting the target drive and running following command:  reiserfsck --rebuild-tree -S -l /root/recovery.log /dev/hdc1(being target drive)
[01:56] <MrShuttleworth> Does anyone know why Nero for Linux sucks so much ?
[01:56] <sn0n> Paddy_EIRE, oo.. you mean the channel.. it was just a guess.. google for their website and start looking there
[01:56] <sn0n> !info sound-juicer
[01:56] <ubotu> sound-juicer: GNOME 2 CD Ripper. In component main, is optional. Version 2.16.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 778 kB, installed size 3404 kB
[01:56] <bimberi> emilia: get to a command prompt and type 'ifconfig'.  Look for a line like "inet addr:192.168.0.10" or the like
[01:57] <jeff_> okay SilentDis
[01:57] <sn0n> !website sound-juicer
[01:57] <jeff_> I am done
[01:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about website sound-juicer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:57] <Shardy> does anyone know of a script or program that automatically writes a x11org.conf file for me?
[01:57] <jeff_> Now reboot???
[01:57] <bimberi> !xconfig
[01:57] <ubotu> To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[01:57] <emilia> bimberi: 192.168.2.10 ?
[01:57] <bulmer> emilia: or type this command   sudo  ip addr show eth0    assuming eth0 is your nic interface
[01:57] <sn0n> Shardy, you the one with the dual monitor problems?
[01:57] <emilia> bulmer: i have 2 network cards
[01:57] <SilentDis> jeff_: great, see you in a few moments then.  sudo reboot!  :D
[01:58] <jeff_> k, brb
[01:58] <bimberi> emilia: sounds plausible.  try 'ping 192.168.2.10' from the other pc
[01:58] <Shardy> no, sn0n
[01:58] <Shardy> not me
[01:58] <Shardy> I wish
[01:58] <Shardy> :)
[01:58] <sn0n> hehehe
[01:58] <Jimbo> tom47...it didnt work
[01:58] <Twigathy> Hi all, I'm considering upgrading to a Core 2 Duo based system but have read lots of conflicting reports about whether ubuntu will work on the newer intel-based motherboards. Anyone here know of the current status?
[01:58] <Jimbo> I dont know what the deal is
[01:58] <sn0n> i was havin fun with dual.. til my glass desk broke under the weight of two 21inch crt's   LoL
[01:59] <tom47> Jimbo tell me exactly what you aded to /etc/fstab pls
[01:59] <Jimbo> k hold on one sec
[01:59] <Jimbo> i saved it in a file
[01:59] <jeff_> okay, back
[01:59] <Jimbo> tom47  /dev/hdb1    /media/windows vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0
[02:00] <jeff_> No noticeable performance difference unfortunately
[02:00] <tom47> Jimbo ah you missed my message ....
[02:00] <Jimbo> ??
[02:00] <Jimbo> Tom..what did I miss?
[02:00] <tom47> Jimbo change /media/windows to /media/hdb1
[02:00] <Jimbo> ooooook
[02:00] <Jimbo> duh
[02:00] <Shardy> another question, and this might be a bit of a noob question, but I just moved in with some friends and they use aol to dialup for internet access, and I uh was just wondering if maybe there was a way I could set Ubuntu up to dial up an aol account?
[02:01] <emilia> bimberi : hrmm, 192.168.2.10 is this computer im on, there is no ip address for the other network card
[02:01] <Jimbo> i loaded linux and i realise im stupid...:(
[02:01] <Shardy> I cant wait until I get high speed again.
[02:01] <Jimbo> brb
[02:02] <pastlives> Can someone help me? I've got some questions before I convert from windows
[02:02] <Kingsqueak> what in gnome remembers application states?  I'm running xfce4 with nm-applet, I only have one entry in auto startup for it and it spawns another one each time I restart xfce.  Trying to find what else is keeping track of the session and spawning them.
[02:02] <jeff_> Sorry, back
[02:02] <jeff_> SilentDis, still having performance troubles :(
[02:02] <SilentDis> !ask | pastlives
[02:02] <ubotu> pastlives: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:02] <pastlives> Cool
[02:02] <boozey> ok i installed apache on linux it installed but its in system directory, and i created a user account in linux in /home/test/ so how would i config apache to /home/test/webserver
[02:03] <pastlives> Okay, I downloaded the uh...I dunno, the version of ubuntu you get to try first before you install
[02:03] <jeff_> the CD ver
[02:03] <wastrel> desktop cd
[02:03] <tom47> pastlives .... the Livecd
[02:03] <Kingsqueak> boozey: you would define a <Directory> container for that dir
[02:03] <Shardy> am I wrong in assuming you cant use aol with ubuntu?
[02:03] <SilentDis> jeff_: welcome back.  i was under the false impression, then, that you were having just problems with video performance.  what seems to be the exact problem?
[02:03] <pastlives> And I loaded it up and everything I noticed off the cd it doesn't have any screen resolutions for widescreen
[02:03] <jeff_> SilentDis, the OS just seems a little bit slow :(
[02:04] <boozey> Kingsqueak can i do this for many user accounts?
[02:04] <crass> Shardy: why would you want to?
[02:04] <pastlives> Is that just cause the one of the cd is kind of a minimal version, or does ubuntu not support widescreen resolutions?
[02:04] <SilentDis> jeff_: wait... are you running off the CD still?
[02:04] <jeff_> For instance, opening and closing windows, multitasking, etc.
[02:04] <Kingsqueak> boozey: there's a default in Apache that allows for /home/user/public_html already, not sure if you knew
[02:04] <jeff_> SilentDis, no of course not...lol
[02:04] <Shardy> crass, its not because I want to, trust me.
[02:04] <Kingsqueak> boozey: that would equate to http://that.server/~user/
[02:04] <Shardy> Im just forced to for the moment until I get a job and get HS
[02:05] <Akuma_> i change PROMP_COMMAND in both root/.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, and it still ignores me .. how am i supposed to do that?
[02:05] <SilentDis> jeff_: lol okes :)
[02:05] <crass> Shardy: didn't they make a linux version of their client?
[02:05] <Kingsqueak> boozey: it's not enabled by default, but you can just uncomment it, UserDirs or something like that
[02:05] <bulmer> pastlives: I believe for LiveCD, defaults are 800x600 or so..for a safe installs..and cant really change it from what i understand unless you build your own livecd
[02:05] <jeff_> SilentDis, the OS just isn't performing nearly as well as I know it should be...my XP on this machine runs much, much faster.
[02:05] <crass> Shardy: if not, then look into WINE or qemu/vmware
[02:05] <SilentDis> jeff_: what are your basic system specs?  processor, speed, ram, etc? :)
[02:05] <wilkin> hey y'all, I need some help when it comes to kernel header source location
[02:05] <jeff_> P4 2.4ghz, 1gb ram
[02:05] <jeff_> 80gb HD
[02:05] <Shardy> Hmm, did they?  I doubt aol would want to, when I asked for shell access I got a bad responce years ago.
[02:05] <Spee_Der> dang
[02:05] <tom47> pastlives ... i am not sure but if you head on along an dinstall it you will get a wider range of choices suited o your hardware
[02:06] <Noah0504> Can anyone point me to an easy-to-follow guide on compiling and building packages?  I want to stop depending on third party repositories...
[02:06] <Shardy> I mean they sounded really pissed off that I asked for a shell account.
[02:06] <tom47> !packages
[02:06] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[02:06] <wastrel> Akuma_:  The PS1 variable controls the appearance of your bash prompt - is that what you're looking for?
[02:06] <SilentDis> jeff_: during the install, what did you set as swap?  how much drive space?
[02:06] <jeff_> SilentDis, I gave Ubuntu the entire Hard-drive
[02:06] <pastlives> So running off the cd is kind of like a safe mode, and is not a direct representative of how ubuntu will actually run on my system?
[02:06] <crass> Shardy: that's totally different, they aren't a shell hosting service
[02:06] <jeff_> I partitioned XP off and gave ubuntu the entire drive
[02:07] <tom47> pastlives i believe thats so yes
[02:07] <SilentDis> jeff_: did you assign any as swap?
[02:07] <Shardy> duh,,  thanks crass
[02:07] <jeff_> SilentDis: I'm not sure what Swap is
[02:07] <Shardy> later
[02:07] <Jimbo> whats that pastebin command again?
[02:07] <pastlives> Okay, cool thanks. I have another inquiry too
[02:07] <Jimbo> this is nt working
[02:07] <tom47> pastlives but you you should get someone with a widescreen to confirm that
[02:07] <pastlives> Okay I'll ask around
[02:07] <Akuma_> wastrel: it is. its kinda confusing then .. promp_command also seems to define the promp string .. hm
[02:07] <bimberi> Noah0504: The Ubuntu Packaging guide at http://help.ubuntu.com
[02:07] <SilentDis> jeff_: hmm... usually, during setup, you're asked to make a drive partition of a few gb to allow linux to swap things too.  it's 'lost' to the machine, but is used by it as swap space for stuff
[02:07] <Jimbo> pastebin | jimbo
[02:07] <maxxism> jeff you need to also make a swap partition.  usually double the size of your RAM
[02:07] <Jaak> how do i check if my nvidia driver is installed and working correctly?
[02:08] <Noah0504> bimberi: Thank you.
[02:08] <wilkin> if i do uname -r, i get the kernel version, when i do ls -l in /usr/src, there's nothing there
[02:08] <jeff_> SilentDis: Unfortunately i have no idea what youre talking about:( Is there some way we could figure it out?
[02:08] <pastlives> How many people here connect through a wireless router, and was it able to connect right after you installed ubuntu?
[02:08] <Jimbo> how do i do pastebin again
[02:08] <SilentDis> jeff_: that's the only thing I can think of that might be causing issue.
[02:08] <Kingsqueak> boozey: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_userdir.html#userdir
[02:08] <Jimbo> !pastebin | jimbo
[02:08] <ubotu> jimbo: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:08] <jeff_> SilentDis: what can I do to fix i t?
[02:08] <bimberi> emilia: you need to set one up on the other card and on the other machine - 'man ifconfig' will help
[02:08] <wastrel> Akuma_:  man bash  - search for PROMPT_COMMAND  with  /
[02:09] <wastrel> Akuma_:  it's a command that's executed before the prompt is drawn
[02:09] <SilentDis> jeff_: unfortunatly, not much other than a reinstall :(  I don't trust 'dynamic' partition resizers myself :P
[02:09] <Jaak> is there a simple command to check if my nvidia glx driver is up and working ok?
[02:09] <jeff_> SilentDis, I don't mind reinstalling I just don't think it'll work
[02:09] <wastrel> Jaak:  glxinfo | grep render
[02:09] <Boomz> Hi everyone!
[02:10] <orkid> join #ubuntu+1
[02:10] <SilentDis> jeff_: why not?
[02:10] <baxter_kylie> Hi. How do I create an mdadm md device from a previously existing pair of raid drives?
[02:10] <Akuma_> wastrel: hmm, i see. the way its defined in the conf file it really looks like a promp though. weird. thanks eh
[02:10] <foo> Can I boot ubuntu desktop live cd into CLI only? (init 3) .. I could do so in knoppix, wonder if I can do it here
[02:10] <bimberi> emilia: something like 'ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.1' on one  and then 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2' on the other PC  (my eth# numbers are guesses)
[02:10] <Spee_Der> Hi Boom
[02:11] <Jimbo> tom47 can you look at this paste bin...something isnt working    http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[02:11] <maxxism> Jaak are you in X?  areter changing the driver type in xorg.conf?
[02:11] <boozey> Kingsqueak WOW THANKS!
[02:11] <boozey> i did not know though
[02:11] <wilkin> i need some kernel help
[02:11] <ademan> how does the "completely remove including configuration files" work in synaptic?
[02:11] <Kingsqueak> boozey: yeah figured :-) it's a handy thing
[02:11] <Jimbo> Tom..sorry this is the link  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31575/
[02:11] <jeff_> grrrrrrrrrrrr
[02:11] <boozey> soon as i created public_html in the folder
[02:11] <boozey> it readed it :D
[02:11] <Boomz> Anyone have the time to give a ubuntu first-time user some much needed help to get Ubuntu up and running? Ive installed Ubuntu, but got stuck on first-time shutdown and now GRUB wont boot. 8-\
[02:11] <baxter_kylie> ademan: it's the same as apt-get remove --purge
[02:11] <jeff_> I just think ubuntu has some sort of hardware conflict iwth this machine, SilentDis
[02:11] <jeff_> that prevents it from running normally
[02:11] <Kingsqueak> boozey: poking around that Directives section on the site is very useful stuff
[02:11] <maxxism> Jaak sorry i meant are you in gnome right now?  after altering your xorg.conf file?  if so then yes your nvidia driver is working
[02:11] <ademan> baxter_kylie: i was actually interested in the internals of it
[02:12] <Jaak> maxxism, yes i changed it into nvidia after aptgetting the driver, but after rebooting i didn't see the logo (running 6.10) so i wanted to check since World of Warcraft won't start
[02:12] <bimberi> ademan: removing a package just removes the executables (essentially), completely remove takes out the config files (eg. within the /etc directory)
[02:12] <boozey> Kingsqueak what would be the best to use for a ftp server to?
[02:12] <maxxism> Jaak yes mine is not displaying anymore either.  think they took it out
[02:12] <tom47> Jimbo you have to paste something in there and then give me the reference url that results eg http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31576/
[02:12] <Jaak> Maxxism, thanks
[02:12] <maxxism> Jaak np
[02:12] <Jimbo> i thought i did
[02:12] <Jaak> good night peeps
[02:12] <satch> what is the name of the package that contains the php-cli interpreter ?
[02:13] <jeff_> sometimes the top of the widnow box begins blinking uncontrollably, SilentDis and i have to reboot to fix it...any idea what that is?
[02:13] <SilentDis> jeff_: my knowledge isn't good enough to help solve a 'general performance' issue over chat, i'd be better able to help with hard problems.  I'd almost have to be there to assist with such an issue.  sorry :(
[02:13] <ademan> bimberi: right, but i mean, does apt-get somehow mark in its database that /etc/X11/xorg.conf belongs to package xorg and is a configuration file? or what?
[02:13] <Kingsqueak> boozey: I would recommend against ftp unless you must have it, it has too many issues.  If you absolutely must have incoming files, I would say proftpd and keep it totally seperate from actual local user accounts for auth
[02:13] <pastlives> Does anyone here use ubuntu with a widescreen resolution??
[02:13] <tom47> Jimbo no you just gave the url of what you pasted into not the resultant url
[02:13] <Jimbo> gimmee a minute
[02:13] <Boomz> Anyone have the time to give a ubuntu first-time user some much needed help to get Ubuntu up and running? Ive installed Ubuntu, but got stuck on first-time shutdown and now GRUB wont boot. 8-\
[02:13] <Kingsqueak> boozey: proftpd or wu-ftpd can work, you can set them up to use their own user db so they aren't actual user accounts on the system
[02:13] <crass> pastlives: I believe mine is
[02:14] <SilentDis> jeff_: you can check your log files, see if there's something listed there...
[02:14] <Crankymonky> Is toram the parameter to load Debian into RAM?
[02:14] <bimberi> ademan: i think so, or it's part of the shell script run when you remove
[02:14] <digitalhav0c> Jeff_, beryl?
[02:15] <pastlives> crass: what's the resolution?
[02:15] <Jimbo> tom heres my fstab file  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31577/
[02:15] <ademan> bimberi: so then its up to the package's uninstall script to descriminate from configuration vs binary?
[02:16] <f1assistance> Is there a wireless adapter (PCI or USB) that works better with Ubuntu?
[02:16] <bimberi> ademan: i don't know for sure.  I only have rudimentary packaging knowledge so I'm wildly guessing.
[02:16] <f1assistance> drivers etc..
[02:16] <sn0n> lol
[02:16] <baxter_kylie> flassistance: anything based on an atheros card
[02:17] <baxter_kylie> er, make that atheros chip
[02:17] <bimberi> ademan: but that knowledge (binary vs config) must be present somewhere (obviously)
[02:17] <ademan> bimberi: well i was just thinking that its about time ./configure && make had not only a GUI wrapper around it, but checkinstall support as well, so that we could not only install from source, but not break with our package manager
[02:17] <Boomz> Anyone have the time to give a Ubuntu first-time user some much needed help to get Ubuntu up and running? Ive installed Ubuntu, but got stuck on first-time shutdown (Had to cold-reboot my computer) and now GRUB wont boot.
[02:17] <macabre> hi there, i've been looking at ubuntu and was thinking i'd do a server/base install and thus no -desktop metapackage.  In case of an upgrade to the next version would I get prompted to replace such things as the init system if there is a new one and such?
[02:17] <tom47> Jimbo looking
[02:17] <SilentDis> quick question:  anyone know of a 'nice' frontend to lame, just for converting sound files?  not looking for CD Ripping.
[02:17] <ademan> bimberi: and since i've been playing around with python and pygtk, thought it might be a nice and easy project for me (well maybe not easy, but still)
[02:18] <f1assistance> baxter_kylie: atheros is better known as?\
[02:18] <ademan> see: useful
[02:18] <boozey> Kingsqueak what is a ftp server, that reads by user accounts on system and sets the ftp to the user home folder
[02:18] <boozey> by account
[02:18] <Jimbo> tom i just did <sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1> again and now i can see the drive
[02:18] <Jimbo> >
[02:18] <f1assistance> baxter_kylie: or atheros chip is used by?
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> boozey: apt-cache search ftpd
[02:19] <fusionxn1> Hey all
[02:19] <bimberi> ademan: It's having that sort of project (ie. goal) that is the single best way to increase your knowledge of these things imnsho - go for it!
[02:19] <[Relic] > has anyone successfully got nvida glx working?
[02:19] <Jimbo> maybe it will still be there if i reboot?
[02:19] <baxter_kylie> flassistance: atheros. They make the chips. Almost all brands have one or two atheros chipsets in their offerings but even version revisions of particular products can swtich chipset makers.
[02:19] <SilentDis> [Relic]  many of us :)
[02:19] <fusionxn1> Is it ok to ask people to check a topic on the forums so i dont have to rewrite it?
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> boozey: look at lukemftpd, what you want is a 'chroot' to homedir, it probably does that, several do
[02:19] <[Relic] > theoritcally it seems to be in place and rebooting w/o problems but no OGL stuff  :(

[02:20] <Jimbo> relic i installed a nvidia driver usint automatrix this morning and thats where the trouble started
[02:20] <bimberi> fusionxn1: that's fine
[02:20] <boozey> Kingsqueak deso proftpd do it?
[02:20] <boozey> does*
[02:20] <fusionxn1> Anyone help me with my issue i posted on Ubuntu Forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=299062
[02:20] <Kingsqueak> boozey: it will, but proftpd and wu-ftpd do a TON more and would be more complicated to setup
[02:20] <[Relic] > did that last night  :)  borked everything, but can't find anyway of getting ogl to run even after the enable thing
[02:20] <f1assistance> baxter_kylie: and there are not issues wtih drivers for Ubuntu?
[02:20] <Kingsqueak> boozey: one of many reasons ftp isn't good with user accounts is the passwords are in plain text and can be snooped

[02:21] <tom47> Jimbo hmmm have not seen that UUID stuff before .... i will consider it and teach muself what its about and then we can discuss unless someone else can help you more immediately
[02:21] <baxter_kylie> flassistance: No. Linux doesn't care who manufactured the parts. It only really cares about the chips. Atheros based wireless devices have a fully open spec and the most advanced support of wireless devices.

[02:23] <Iceman_B^Ltop> this channel looks pretty crowded, can I just ask a question at my leisure in here?
[02:23] <f1assistance> baxter_kylie: thanks, I will look around...
[02:23] <tom47> Jimbo am looking at the way the other partitions are mounted in your pastebin
[02:23] <fusionxn1> aRE ntfs drives safe for writing yet
[02:23] <Toma-> tom47: its a method of creating a unique tag for devices, rather than using /dev/hda and friends, as the devices are sometimes prone to swapping without notice
[02:23] <tom47> Jimbo eg lokk at /dev/hda1
[02:24] <Toma-> tom47: if youre really keep, you can simply convert everything back to /dev items. i did that for my fstab
[02:24] <Jimbo> k looking
[02:24] <tom47> Toma ok .... so where do you discover the UUID for a specific partition pls ?
[02:24] <SilentDis> quick question:  anyone know of a 'nice' frontend to lame, just for converting sound files?  not looking for CD Ripping.
[02:24] <fusionxn1> Is there any logitech G15 drivers yet?
[02:24] <Jimbo> i see the files on the drive in filesystem/media/hdb1 now...should i reboot and see if it stays mounted/
[02:24] <Toma-> tom47: let me see
[02:25] <bulmer> Jimbo: you can try unmounting the drive, then just type  mount -a  to mount what is listed on /etc/fstab
[02:25] <concept10> tom47, the command blkid
[02:25] <tom47> Jimbo did you do anything else other than reboot?  or did it work and you just found out lol
[02:25] <Toma-> tom47: vol_id
[02:26] <concept10> vol_id?
[02:26] <Jimbo> did nothing but re ran sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1
[02:26] <Toma-> yep
[02:26] <SilentDis> take care all.  i'll check in later :)
[02:26] <Jimbo> then it didnt appear right away...tilli ran it again
[02:26] <tom47> Jimbo ah ok ... no rebooting wont help have to sort out this UUID first
[02:26] <Jimbo> k
[02:27] <Toma-> tom47: you can either run "vol_id -u <UUID number>" to decode the mess, or use blkid like concept10 said to sort thru it and find it.
[02:27] <Jimbo> somebody tell me why im getting this headach instead of just continieing to use xp...i forgot
[02:28] <carlfk_lap> i think mplauyer-plugin locked my sound dev - play foo.wav now says "sox: Can't open output file '/dev/dsp': Device or resource busy" - any idea how I can fix?
[02:28] <Toma-> Jimbo: once youre setup, thats it. dont have to tweak the system ever again
[02:28] <Jimbo> really?
[02:28] <worldjam> I know this is probably the dumbist question you will ever hear but: I have ubuntu desktop 6.06 and just realised I need LAMP to use ruby on rails so can I install lamp on this ubuntu or do I need the server edition and if so is there an easy way to go from desktop to server????
[02:28] <Toma-> yep. you can just apt-get dist-upgrade to update to the newest release when it comes out
[02:28] <wildchild> are any krita tutorials for newbies
[02:28] <Toma-> and everything will be nice and stable
=== freezey is now known as jadacyrus
[02:29] <Toma-> Jimbo: i havent had to change anything on this PC for over 2 years
[02:29] <tom47> Toma how do you revert to the /dev/hdb1 style fstab?
[02:29] <carlfk_lap> worldjam: you can just apt-get mysql, apacye, etc... and run it on your current setup
[02:29] <fusionxn1> does the "zboard fang" have any linux drivers?
[02:29] <Jimbo> i thought i t was nice and stable yesterday....till i used automatrix and installed nvidia drivers
[02:29] <Toma-> tom47: find what each different uuid represents, delete it, and replace it with the valid /dev entry
[02:29] <worldjam> oh k thanx
[02:30] <Toma-> Jimbo: didnt anyone tell you automatix is the spawn of satan?
[02:30] <sn0n> worldjam, there is a lil more then just that.. but yea..
[02:30] <Jimbo> everything was workin..network...and i had to screw it up somehow
[02:30] <Jimbo> i found that out today toma
[02:30] <fusionxn1> is there a way to stop HDDs been turned off on restart / shutdown? The seem to start up on up everytime (i have 3 drives) and is adding 10secodns to boot time.
[02:30] <Toma-> :<
[02:30] <[DFC] Eggman> Jimbo: thats the joy of linux
[02:30] <tom47> Toma pls look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31577/
[02:30] <Toma-> Jimbo: maybe easyubuntu can fix it up for ya..
[02:30] <Jimbo> at least with windowz when i hose things up its not a problem to fix lol
[02:30] <Jimbo> easyubuntu?
[02:30] <Toma-> !easyubuntu
[02:30] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[02:31] <Jimbo> i re installed the os already
[02:31] <Toma-> easyubuntu is the total opposite to automatix, in the fact that it works :>
[02:31] <morphish> what's easybuntu?
[02:31] <Jamesz> I am the person who cant get my wireless card workin and i know jester
[02:31] <Toma-> ahh there is no easyubuntu for edgy yet
[02:31] <tom47> Toma does it work for edgy??? did not look like it when i looked at it a day or two ago
[02:32] <Jimbo> if i could just get the drives to stay mounted and the network working with the windows boxes again id be happy for at least an hour
[02:32] <[Relic] > nothing seems to be working so is there any repartition program that would allow me to break up a large partition w/o losing all the info?
[02:32] <fusionxn1> My X-FI sound card wont work - will it - until Creative release drivers in Q2 2007?
[02:32] <Jamesz> I am the person who cant get my wireless card workin and i know jester can anyone help?
[02:32] <carlfk_lap> how can I tell why:  '/dev/dsp': Device or resource busy
[02:32] <morphish> Jimbo: usually you add those things in /etc/fstab, the UUIDs in there is something i haven't looked up yet, try w/o
[02:33] <carlfk_lap> reboot seems so lame a way to fix, but im not sure what else
[02:33] <Toma-> Jimbo: theres an issue with NTFS drives and uuids in fstab at the moment..
[02:33] <Jimbo> morphish..try without what?
[02:33] <wildchild> how can I update my krita to krita 1.6 with edgy
[02:33] <Jimbo> i dont have an ntfs on this box anymore
[02:33] <johnny_> <[Relic] > gparted
[02:33] <fusionxn1> My X-FI sound card wont work until Creative release drivers in Q2 2007, is that right?
[02:33] <Jimbo> i converted the second drive to fat thinking it would work better on a windows network
[02:33] <morphish> Jimbo: making sure you have the right fstab entries, on boot what is in that file gets mounted (unless noauto is specified as option (like the crom entry for example)
[02:33] <Toma-> carlfk_lap: fuser will tell you whats using a device. you can usually bet that esd is hogging the /dev/dsp, so try 'killall esd' and try again
[02:34] <[Relic] > johnny_,that didn't seem to work
[02:34] <tom47> Jimbo is that a FAT32 or an NTFS file system we are trying to mount here?
[02:34] <morphish> Jimbo: so all you did was change the filesystem? then change the filesystem of that partition in fstab
[02:34] <Jimbo> tat32
[02:34] <Jimbo> fat32
[02:34] <carlfk_lap> Toma-: bing! thanks
[02:34] <Toma-> Jimbo: biggest issue with fat (imho) is the 4gb file size limit
[02:34] <Toma-> carlfk_lap: np
[02:35] <Jimbo> morphish..the fat drive was working yesteday
[02:35] <Bung> someone mentioned to me that the ubuntu 6.10 would work as a livecd, is this true?
[02:35] <aranjedeath> yes
[02:35] <Bung> oops, 6.10 install CD
[02:35] <aranjedeath> mine did
[02:35] <satch> what is the name of the package that contains the php-cli interpreter ?
[02:35] <aranjedeath> oh
[02:35] <aranjedeath> dunnno
[02:35] <shwag> modlogan, webalizer, or awstats ?
[02:35] <Jimbo> toma...it would take bout 5 minutes to change filesystem withgparted right?
[02:35] <morphish> Jimbo: did it mount automagically or did you mount it manually? manually you can mount anything that works, automagically only what is properly set in fstab
[02:35] <seamus7> After upgrade to Edgy, some applets display visual noise as their background if I set their respective panel to any degree of transparency. This never happened back in Dapper. Any ideas?
[02:35] <tom47> Bung the answer is yes conditionally .... some special ones don't
[02:35] <Jimbo> is there another filesystem i can read from the windows boxes?
[02:36] <Toma-> Jimbo: yep, maybe less. you still have to re-make your own fstab by hand tho, its such a PITA.
[02:36] <Bung> tom47, ok thanks
[02:36] <Kingsqueak> seamus7: you sure you are set to 24bpp color depth?
[02:36] <Staz> Anyone has a URL for a good guide for using 'screen' ?
[02:36] <tom47> morphish pls take a look at Jimbo's fstab at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31577/
[02:36] <seamus7> Kingsqueak: no ... where do I change this setting?
[02:36] <Toma-> Jimbo: Samba works super for LAN with iwndows boxes
[02:36] <Jimbo> Toma...first time i looked at linux was day before yesterday...i dunno sh*t
[02:37] <Toma-> Jimbo: well... probably best to hang out in here :D
[02:37] <Jimbo> i can see the machine from windows but cant access now
[02:37] <[Relic] > anything other than gparted?
[02:37] <tom47> Jimbo have you re-installed without automatix?
[02:37] <Jimbo> yea
[02:37] <Jimbo> no automatrix any more
[02:37] <Toma-> Jimbo: if you do want to mess up your partitions, make sure you keep your root filesystem and swap where they are, so you can boot and get help from here
[02:37] <Jimbo> i reloaded from ubuntu cd today
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> seamus7: try this 'xdpyinfo | grep "depth of root"'
[02:38] <fusionxn1> Anyone help i cant get my logitech mic to work with skype
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> seamus7: that will tell you if you are in 24bpp
[02:38] <Jimbo> toma...did you see my fstab file?
[02:38] <morphish> Jimbo: /dev/hdb1    /media/hdb1 vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0    <--looks ok, you could try adding defaults, before the iocharset or even instead of the charset, but before you change anything i need you to tell me what it says when you do this 'mount /media/hdb1'
[02:38] <Toma-> Jimbo: yeh
[02:38] <edoardo> hi everyone! you guys, i've just installed edgy, and... what's the root password? i was never asked i think : D
[02:38] <seamus7> Kingsqueak: yeah it comes back with '24 panes'

[02:39] <[DFC] Eggman> sudo uses your user password
[02:39] <Xaphoo> is ntfs-3g reliable and stable?
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> seamus7: what vid card do you have?

[02:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about learn something quick - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:39] <morphish> Jimbo: umount /media/hdb1 then 'mount /media/hdb1'
[02:40] <edoardo> cool, i set it
[02:40] <edoardo> : D
[02:40] <Toma-> foysavas: try not to abuse the bot. use '/msg ubuntu help' if you really want to play with it
[02:40] <edoardo> thanks you guys! ciao! : )
[02:40] <Jimbo> morph..ok

[02:40] <fusionxn1> Does NTFS writing work yet?!
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> seamus7: k, yeah not sure then, sorry
[02:41] <Toma-> i gotta go Jimbo, sorry!
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> how whacky is it that xfce seems to do transparency when you move a window but it doesn't have a facility to set overall opacity
[02:42] <Jimbo> thanx t
[02:42] <Jimbo> Thanx toma
[02:42] <Jimbo> morphish..unmount doesnt unmount it now
[02:42] <morphish> Jimbo: are you typing umount or unmount? (it's umount)
[02:42] <DarkMageZ> fusionxn1, you can add ntfs writing using ntfs-3g.
[02:42] <fusionxn1> is it safe?
[02:42] <Jimbo> oook
[02:42] <ArrenLex> Is there an easy way to change one line in a bunch of files? Say I have five text files in a folder that all contain the line "todo: go to the moon". Is there any way to change this line to "todo: go to the store" in every file?
[02:43] <britt> does anybody know if lirc works now for edgy?
[02:43] <DarkMageZ> fusionxn1, i haven't heard of anyone having a problem
[02:43] <chotchki> hey guys i have an odd issue... my php5 has the xsl module installed, however if i call it from the command line the xsl module is no where to be found... does anyone know how to enable it?
[02:43] <morphish> ArrenLex: check out sed for that with a nice for loop or wildcards
[02:43] <systest> ArrenLex: check out "sed"
[02:43] <fusionxn1> well !fuse says its unsafe
[02:43] <fusionxn1> im worried to use it
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> chotchki: check php.ini
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> chotchki: probably have to load the mod
[02:43] <ArrenLex> Okay; I will. Thanks.
[02:44] <at0m> does anyone else find edgy to be more laggy / unoptomized than dapper?
[02:44] <britt> i find it to be faster?
[02:44] <Jimbo> morph, using umount /media/hdb1...it doesnt seem to unmount cus i can still see the files
[02:44] <noelferreira> are you there lupine_85?
[02:44] <DarkMageZ> fusionxn1, fuse is dangerous yes. ntfs-3g is a completely different project
[02:44] <chotchki> i have "extension=xsl.so" in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini... is that what i need
[02:44] <morphish> i never tried dapper and this is a lowly Duron, i am not able to comment, but will have to say anyway, this machine sux ;)
[02:44] <Jimbo> wait a minute
[02:44] <Jimbo> now it wants a passwork
[02:44] <Jimbo> word
[02:45] <DarkMageZ> !tell fusionxn1 | ntfs-3g
[02:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tell fusionxn1 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> chotchki: looks right
[02:45] <morphish> Jimbo: cause only root can do that stuff so yeah 'sudo umount /media/hdab1'
[02:45] <at0m> im running a monster and lagging to hell
[02:45] <at0m> must be a 6600GT issue
[02:45] <wildchild> is there a way to update krita from 1.5 to 1.6 or I have to install package by sudo apt-get install krita ??
[02:45] <fusionxn1> Dark - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=2697&thread_id=23836054 ? Is it safe 100% as i got some family stuff on here that is backup but i dont wanna lose all the same
[02:45] <DarkMageZ> !ntfs-3g
[02:45] <britt> lirc, its not working on edgy, why?
[02:45] <morphish> Jimbo: i don't add sudo since i don't do that stuff as user
[02:45] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> chotchki: try phpinfo();
[02:45] <fusionxn1> use with caution :/
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> chotchki: see if it sees it and where it thinks it's .ini is

[02:46] <zunshine> Guys, I just installed an nvidia video card. I try to configure and it says that everyone wears a nice hat. I mean it says that the kernel module isn't found. Google shows that this error happens with some people on Edgy. How do I fix please?
[02:46] <DarkMageZ> fusionxn1, yup, but it has been tested well. i have not heard any bad stories about it
[02:46] <Jimbo> morph..now the directories in hdb1 have lock icons on them

[02:46] <funkyHat> Is it possible to make windows maximise over some gnome panels, but not all?
[02:46] <at0m> get envy script zunshine
[02:46] <chotchki> Kingsqueak: ahh i didnt think of looking what php.ini was looking at
[02:46] <morphish> Jimbo: ok close your file manager, let's do this in a terminal, i need to see what the commands tell you, so you need to see that ;)
[02:47] <cornell> I've installed ubuntu server, LAMP.  I've a dying disk from the previous web server and have copied the /var/www from the dying drive to the new install.  It seems document root is /var/www while on the old machine it was /var/www/html.  Observing /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, I note that it's all comments.  I added DocumentRoot /var/www/html to it and used apache2ctl restart to restart the server.  But when I browse to the machine, it see
[02:47] <zunshine> at0m, Where can I get that? And will it mess things up? I hear people all the time say automatix is a very bad thing, is envy like that?
[02:47] <morphish> Jimbo: nos ls -al /media/hdb1  shows you what?
[02:47] <Jimbo> im in terminal
[02:47] <wildchild> is there a way to update krita from 1.5 to 1.6 or I have to install package by sudo apt-get install krita ??
[02:47] <Jimbo> directories are gonen now   umopunt worked
[02:47] <seamus7> Hi all ... is it possible to do a fresh reinstall of Edgy through the Terminal?
[02:47] <sheik> hey, I have a laptop.. and the wireless worked fine for quite a while after the install, and all of a sudden its not working. I think the interface is ath0, but I cannot get it to work properly.. anyone know how i can get it working?
[02:47] <Jimbo> morph one sec
[02:48] <morphish> cornell: lok in /etc/apache2/site_enabled (check for the correct spelling) that and apache2.conf hold info, httpd.conf is only for extra info
[02:48] <Jimbo> nos ls -al /media/hdb1  command not found

[02:50] <at0m> i had the exact same issue as you zunshine. believe me :)
[02:50] <Jimbo> ran  sudo mount /media/hdb1 again and i get message  /dev/hdb1 already mounted or /media/hdb1 busy

[02:52] <zipzo> anyone know why my printer works very poorly in ubuntu?
[02:52] <morphish> Jimbo: so you mounted it twice, ok, if you could mount it with 'mount /dev/hdb1' then it read fstab same as it should on bootup, so you should be good to have it mounted on boot, one question left, have you modprobed a module for vfat before you mounted it the first time?
[02:52] <pluto> Chris_: I head some wireless cards are not as compatible with Ubuntu as others, but it sound like the D-Link should work fine.  Thank you.

[02:54] <morphish> Jimbo: then i guess you didnt do it 'sudo modprobe vfat' <-- that would load a vfat module, but since you don't know what i mean, likely you didn't do that, so all is good

[02:55] <chotchki> Kingsqueak: i ran a diff over the apache vs the cli php.ini and the only difference is the max memory... could that stop the loading of modules?
[02:55] <Jimbo> crossin fingers and rebooting
[02:55] <Chris_> hey, im running ubuntu right now, but the last time i made an iso cd, i used windows, what can i use to write cds in ubuntu?
[02:55] <zipzo> so ya...printer problems
[02:55] <morphish> zipzo: have you used it in linux before (ok)? and now in ubuntu it is crap? or is this your first time using linux?
[02:55] <chotchki> Chris_: cdrecord or k3b
[02:55] <Jimbo> i need to take a break reguardless of results...im toasted
[02:55] <Chris_> ok
[02:55] <Chris_> ty
[02:55] <zipzo> ya, ubuntu is first time in linux
[02:55] <Jimbo> bbl
[02:55] <bimberi> Chris_: right-click in Nautilus (the file manager) and select Write to Disc
[02:56] <Chris_> oh
[02:56] <tuckerm> Anyone know how to unistall another version of linux via sudo?
[02:56] <Chris_> really easy i see
[02:56] <Chris_> thanks
[02:56] <lastnode> tuckerm, you mean a kernel?
[02:56] <bimberi> Chris_: np :)
[02:56] <chotchki> Chris_: just depends what you're used to ;)
[02:56] <win2lin>  Greetings.  I can't get Gnomebaker to format a DVD nor copy a DVD.  The drive list is empty for the drive with the blank media.
[02:56] <morphish> tuckerm: another distro? just format that partition, making sure your ubuntu kernel is not amongst the partitions you format
[02:57] <zipzo> morphis: i have never tried printing in another version of linux
[02:57] <zipzo> why? do some printers just suck in ubuntu or something?
[02:57] <aranjedeath> yeah
[02:57] <aranjedeath> hl1450 does
[02:57] <tuckerm> how would i do that without a 98 disk? (friend in trouble lol)
[02:57] <zipzo> i have a canon s820
[02:57] <fusionxn1> Anyone used / using NTFS-3G
[02:58] <morphish> zipzo: http://www.linuxprinting.org/  should help you then
[02:58] <bimberi> zipzo: yes, some manufacturers don't support Linux very well at all.  Canon is one of those
[02:58] <digitalhav0c> sheik, Acer Aspire 5044WLMi
[02:58] <digitalhav0c> ?
[02:58] <aranjedeath> My brother hl1450 dont print very well. it doesnt support PS printing
[02:58] <at0m> any multitasking window speed improvements with KDE over Gnome?
[02:58] <digitalhav0c> i love gnome
[02:58] <[Relic] > gparted gives me a try booting with irqpoll any ideas?
[02:58] <digitalhav0c> :)
[02:58] <sheik> digitalhav0c: Acer Aspire S100
[02:59] <seamus7> Anyone... can I do an Edgy reinstall via the Terminal or Synaptic or Web without having to burn any media?
[02:59] <morphish> zipzo: in ubuntu i actually got lucky and my HP officeJet prints and scans just as  bad as it does in windows now (refering to the scan results of photos), scanning didn't work in other distros as easily
[02:59] <saif> woohoo! finally got beryl+xgl on my ati 200m with fglrx 8.24 with dapper! :)
[02:59] <tuckerm> how would i format the partion without a 98 disk? (friend in trouble lol)
[02:59] <morphish> zipzo: saying if anything printing should be easiest here
[02:59] <bruenig> seamus7, a reinstall? as in you installed it and want to start fresh? If that is the case then no.
[02:59] <saif> any news on amd opening up the ati drivers?
[02:59] <morphish> saif: interesting, as i have that chipset in my lapto
[02:59] <[DFC] Eggman> tuckerm: a live cd might work for you
[02:59] <at0m> yeah live cd
[02:59] <saif> morphish, very annoying isn't it?
[02:59] <at0m> or a bootable win98 cd
[03:00] <morphish> saif: just that i have edgy and not yet bothered with the fglrx drivers, which are now up to 8.30.something
[03:00] <seamus7> bruenig: that's right.. I upgraded to Edgy but now want to do a fresh Edgy installation. I have Dapper LiveCD's.
[03:00] <Jimbo> morphish: It worked! Drive is still there. I think Ill eat dinner and worry bout the networking later or tommorrow
[03:00] <Jimbo> thanx again all
[03:00] <saif> morphish, the fglrx drivers dont work! :)
[03:00] <morphish> Jimbo: tip though
[03:00] <Jimbo> ?
[03:00] <saif> morphish, only 8.24 works
[03:00] <morphish> Jimbo: think linux, not distro
[03:00] <[Relic] > are your hplip? librarys so badly outdated as the repository ones were when I was looking for a decent driver??  :)
[03:00] <saif> morphish, for the ati 200m that is!
[03:00] <Jimbo> k
[03:00] <at0m> u can make win98 floppy boot disks as a cd boot
[03:00] <bruenig> seamus7, get the edgy cd is the only way to start fresh. You may reinstall dapper and then upgrade immediately but it would all just be so much easier burning edgy.
[03:00] <at0m> with nero
[03:00] <jamie427> can anyone help me i am new to linux and unbuntu
[03:00] <Jimbo> all loinux pretty much the same huhn
[03:00] <morphish> Jimbo: learn how it works in linux, and you can self yourself when the fancy gui tools fail you
[03:01] <seamus7> bruenig: ok thx
[03:01] <bruenig> !anyone | jamie427
[03:01] <ubotu> jamie427: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:01] <morphish> saif: i ran 8.28.8 last on my 200m (amd64 laptop)
[03:01] <Jimbo> yea..i got a helluva lot to learn re this os
[03:01] <jamie427> my sound worked on a previous install but now it doesnt
[03:01] <digitalhav0c> sheik, battery on laptop dying but search for madwifi drivers
[03:01] <Jimbo> nothin but windoz since 1998
[03:01] <morphish> Jimbo: google helps too if this channel is too busy
[03:01] <saif> morphish, and u got 3d rendering?
[03:01] <Jimbo> yea
[03:01] <morphish> saif: aye
[03:01] <Zaehlas> Hello all, I am working on building a new server (migrating from Microsloth), anyway, I want the server installation with a graphical interface, I am NOT a linux guru.  Any good suggestions on dropping gnome into a base ubuntu server install?
[03:01] <digitalhav0c> sorry
[03:01] <sheik> digitalhav0c: the drivers are on there... the wireless worked before
[03:01] <Jimbo> i gotta eat something
[03:01] <tuckerm> at0m: I know, a stupid friend installed backtrack and has no fucking clue on partitions and fuxored his xp thing
[03:01] <digitalhav0c> oh
[03:01] <Jimbo> laterz
[03:02] <saif> morphish, HOW!!!
[03:02] <seamus7> ubotu: it may be a helpful flag to add a signal word like "anyone" or "hello".
[03:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about it may be a helpful flag to add a signal word like "anyone" or "hello". - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:02] <digitalhav0c> try reinstalling the drivers
[03:02] <bruenig> Zaehlas, just do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to get a graphical interface
[03:02] <fusionxn1> I need some serious advice, some of my hardware wont work with ubuntu/linux - should i go ahead anyway?
[03:02] <saif> morphish, i tried everything, and i couldn't get 3d rendering! that's y i reverted to dapper ( the 8.24 work on dapper, and i dont know how to install them on edgy! :S )
[03:02] <ftp4you> question: if ubunto on one computer
[03:02] <lastnode> fusionxn1, what osrta hardware?
[03:02] <ftp4you> woops
[03:02] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: what hardwhere?
[03:03] <[Relic] > anything other than gparted that will adjust partitions?
[03:03] <pianoboy3333> How do I delete entries in gconf-editor?
[03:03] <Zaehlas> woot!  that's what I need, then!
[03:03] <Zaehlas> Thank you, Bruenig
[03:03] <zunshine> at0m, I'm gonna give this a shot now. Thank you, I hope it worked. I'll come back and let you know. : )
[03:03] <morphish> saif: i used the ati installer in sourcemage last, but there amd64 is not so nice 32bit/64bit wise (Although i have made a spell for 32bit libs for it) so i had to move some stuff around, the installer puts libGL.so.2 and friends in /usr/X11R6 dirs when the lib and the drivers should be in the right /usr/lib/xorg dirs
[03:03] <bimberi> pianoboy3333: cfdisk (text based)
[03:03] <fusionxn1> X-FI, Logitech USB mic, zboard fang, not sure about g15 and NTFX
[03:03] <[DFC] Eggman> [Relic] : theres partition magic if you have windoes installed
[03:03] <fusionxn1> NTFS*
[03:03] <pianoboy3333> bimberi: wtf...?
[03:03] <ftp4you> if ubuntu has internet access on 1 computer and have installed many apps how could i burn packages to cd so i can install them on ubuntu which does not have access
[03:03] <ftp4you> is there a way
[03:04] <[Relic] > [DFC] Eggman, I don't have windows  :)
[03:04] <caveMan_> is it possible to restart X without closing all the programs I have running?
[03:04] <bimberi> pianoboy3333: sorry, that was for [Relic] 
[03:04] <morphish> saif: in other words i went around the package manager of a distro and i got it working, just moved 32bit libs in its own place, left 64bit where ldd looked for them , added the location for the 32bit libs to ld.so.conf and voila got it all happy, but i might be better in doing it rather than explaining it
[03:04] <Chris_> hmm, caveman
[03:04] <bruenig> ftp4you, sudo apt-get -d install packages After you do that the package will be in /var/cache/apt/archives
[03:05] <[Relic] > going to switch the drive cables around and try gparted once more and if that don't work I will just have to hope my DVD backups are ok
[03:05] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman & lastnode any ideas? I got a thread on it
[03:05] <bruenig> ftp4you, note that doing that will just download packages not install them
[03:05] <[Relic] > back later  :)  maybe  :)
[03:05] <morphish> caveMan_: you will depend on your DE restarting them as a session, which only works if you properly log out, restart, log in
[03:05] <lastnode> fusionxn1, if your graphics card adn net access work, you should install and then troubleshoot the rest.
[03:05] <lastnode> (at least that's my take on it)
[03:05] <ftp4you> aren't the files already on computer
[03:05] <fusionxn1> lastnode - yes ot netowkr and 7900gt yes
[03:05] <bimberi> pianoboy3333: right-click, Unset Key...   ??
[03:05] <morphish> xorg had a summer of code project for google that was going to be Xscreen for such times, but i don't know what happened with that :/ would be nice to have an xscreen
[03:05] <caveMan_> morphish, so they have to be restarted, I can't for example keep my irc connection
[03:06] <fusionxn1> lastnode - no point in then finding out that some hardware will neverwork
[03:06] <saif> morphish, i've talked to a lot of ppl who were suffering from this driver and this particular chipset, even the ati fglrx howto says it's not supported, y don't u write a howto or somethn, coz it seems a bit out my league to figure out, and i am sure a lot of ppl would appreciate it!
[03:06] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: well i have a logictec mouse (mx 518) and it worked
[03:06] <bruenig> ftp4you, if you installed them through the repos, the packages will be in that same directory
[03:06] <ftp4you> that command will just download them all in that dir like freebsd ports kind of
[03:06] <morphish> caveMan_: not if they are X apps, if you run irssi in a screen in a terminal it stays up, but all X apps die when the server dies
[03:06] <fusionxn1> DFC - My logitech USB Mic is found but cant get to work with skype etc
[03:06] <lastnode> fusionxn1, never say never ;-) people are writing drivers for new hardware everyday
[03:06] <ftp4you> i did it threw add remove programs
[03:07] <fusionxn1> lastnode - i found some G15 drivers :)
[03:07] <jessid> Hello. I have a Zire 72 and I havent beeen able to make it "visible" to ubuntu...some one can help me? Im tired of Windows....
[03:07] <lastnode> fusionxn1, for example, my native broadcom wireless didnt function under dapper, but under edgy it does :-)
[03:07] <morphish> saif: hm, now i am curious about installing it, and i have no idea why you say it is not supported, we are both talking about the Xpress 200m, right? last time i looked it said it is supported
[03:07] <Chris_> how do you restart X? i tried going alt+ctrl+ F1 and then sudo startx
[03:07] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: oh man mic, im out of it.
[03:07] <Chris_> it wouldnt work?
[03:07] <fusionxn1> lastnode - http://g15tools.sourceforge.net/
[03:07] <lastnode> jessid, have you tried googling?
[03:07] <fusionxn1> is that a driver
[03:07] <ftp4you> whats the dir of repo
[03:07] <Chris_> it said X already running
[03:07] <morphish> Chris_: /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[03:07] <fusionxn1> DFC - Why? lol
[03:07] <saif> morphish, hold on, i'll post the howto that i use
[03:07] <Chris_> ok thx
[03:08] <morphish> Chris_: or zap it with ctrl-alt-backspace
[03:08] <jessid> lastnode I have tried jpilot, jejeje
[03:08] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: i recoment install and then just mess around and keep windowsfor games
[03:08] <Chris_> ok
[03:08] <Chris_> thx
[03:08] <morphish> saif: eff the howto if it says something that is not matching the release notes ;)
[03:08] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: i read it as mouse mic and mouse are not even close
[03:08] <lastnode> jessid, i neither own a palm, or have ever used on extensively :\ sorry, your best bet is to keep asking in here
[03:08] <fusionxn1> DFC - I decided gaes anit no option with quad core and 8800 taking the pee in price
[03:08] <lastnode> i know wehave a few palm users
[03:08] <fusionxn1> games*
[03:09] <jessid> lastnode thanks
[03:09] <caveMan_> newbie question, when I suspend the program with ctrl+z how can I have it run in the backgroudn?
[03:09] <jessid> Some of you have ever made a PalmPilot "speak" with ubuntu??? Can some of you help me? /dev/pilot is not a device in my PC....
[03:09] <fusionxn1> is there a way to stop HDDs been turned off on restart / shutdown?
[03:10] <Telroth_Plushie|> caveMan_,
[03:10] <Telroth_Plushie|> not sure how to move it
[03:10] <[DFC] Eggman> maybe i should boot into ubuntu...
[03:10] <goofey_> caveMan_: type bg
[03:10] <fusionxn1> when ever i restart or something each on has to start up again
[03:10] <Poromenos> is there a package similar to mod_bandwidth for apache?
[03:10] <goofey_> caveMan_: fg will bring it to the foreground
[03:10] <Telroth_Plushie|> fusionxn1, you mean mount each one?
[03:10] <Chris_> thanks morph, that worked
[03:10] <bruenig> !info libapache2-mod-cband
[03:10] <ubotu> libapache2-mod-cband: An Apache 2 module for bandwidth limiting the webserver. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.7.4-1 (edgy), package size 39 kB, installed size 184 kB
[03:10] <caveMan_> goofey_, and then I can safetly close that console and GUI program will continue running?
[03:10] <saif> morphish, i have suffered with this card since 8.18 with different workarounds, the relase notes on the ati website always said that it is supported, when it actually isn't,
[03:11] <Poromenos> mmm, thanks bruenig
[03:11] <fusionxn1> Telroth_Plushie| - everytime i restart each harddrive starts up again.. when in post screen.
[03:11] <goofey_> caveMan_: most cases, yes
[03:12] <fusionxn1> Telroth_Plushie| - hard to say when my bios/post detects my harddrives - when im running ubuntu it seems to start each on up again
[03:13] <Poromenos> bruenig: do you have experience with this module?
[03:13] <Telroth_Plushie|> fusionxn1, i can't help you, my HDDs spin down and back up to, but it's not a problem for me
[03:13] <fusionxn1> Telroth_Plushie| i got 3 hdds adds about 10secs onto boot time
[03:13] <bruenig> Poromenos, none whatsoever, I really have no idea what it does. Looked like it fit your description though
[03:13] <Poromenos> bruenig: indeed it does, thanks a lot :)
[03:14] <jessid> hello. Can some of you help me to make Ubuntu speak with a palmPilot?  Thanks! I am tired of windows...I miss my Ubuntu, ;-)
[03:14] <edoardo> byebye everyone! : )
[03:15] <ftp4you> if i burn all the .deb files under /var/cache/apt/archives i then can copy them to same dir on other unbuntu system and used add remove programs and it won't need interent
[03:15] <mike-e> when is someone going to set up reliable repositories for packages like w32codecs?
[03:15] <morphish> saif: and i have had many release since 8.16.20 running, last one i ran was 8.28.8, but brb
[03:16] <miracel> hi, was trying to make my usb-stick bootable, but only received "./unix/syslinux: possibly unsafe /tmp permissions". do you have any ideas how to get around this?
[03:16] <bimberi> ftp4you: it will use those files rather than downloading them again yes
[03:16] <ftp4you> thanks
[03:16] <fusionxn1> i got 3 things wont work under linux, so i guess im best sticking with windows :( ??
[03:16] <Telroth_Plushie|> mike-e, ubuntu already has in their main repos
[03:16] <saif> morphish, :S what is ur computer? mine is a hp pavilion 5094 with amd64 ml-37! i guess u have some kind of lucky combination!
[03:16] <saif> (or u know what ur doing! hehe
[03:16] <bruenig> ftp4you, make sure you get them all, you may need some of the dependencies in there that may look unimportant
[03:17] <mike-e> so cipherfunk is no longer needed?
[03:17] <ftp4you> are there codecs for ubuntu like xvid/flac/rmvb/divx/etc..
[03:17] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: but would you need them in linux?
[03:17] <ftp4you> ok thanks
[03:17] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - X-FI :(, Zboard fang wouldlike but not really and 3rd is NTFS so i need this last 1 for sure
[03:18] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: i dont really see why you need the NTFS support, i never touch my windows partition when im in linux
[03:18] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - ubuntu will be my only os
[03:18] <Saulren> How do I gain Owner permissions? I can't do something because it says I am not the owner.

[03:20] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: no sound seems like it would be pretty bad,
[03:20] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - on board only
[03:20] <tom47> Saulren and porecede chown with sudo as you will need that level of authority to do it
[03:20] <saif> caveMan_,  u can
[03:21] <gubuntu> how do i force install using -mcpan?
[03:21] <gubuntu> perl -MCPAN -e 'force install Mail::SpamAssassin'   Does not work
[03:21] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: well i was looking around and x-fi drivers are exprected to come out Q2 in 2007
[03:21] <Saulren> so if I:  chown user:group filename    that gives me owner permissions on all levels?
[03:21] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - yes
[03:21] <Saulren> basically i need owner permissions on /usr/local
[03:22] <Saulren> my user is currently ubuntu still
[03:22] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - im worried about my harddrives the most
[03:22] <Saulren> so what would i type exactly?
[03:22] <Kingsqueak> gubuntu: why not just apt-get install spamassassin ?
[03:22] <ftp4you> love this os i can almost get rid of microsoft!
[03:22] <gubuntu> for more compliacted reasons theni would like to go into
[03:22] <ftp4you> need to learn how to do couple more things
[03:23] <[DFC] Eggman> fusionxn1: why are you worried about them? you can back up your data before you try to install
[03:23] <Kingsqueak> gubuntu: k, what's the error it's giving you with cpan?
[03:23] <fusionxn1> [DFC] Eggman - 300GB?? Lol
[03:23] <pastlives> Does anyone here know if the latest release of Ubuntu for AMD64 has the necessary drivers for the Broadcom 802.11g wireless adapter?? If no, any way I can find out??
[03:23] <Saulren> so:  chown ubuntu:ubuntu /user/local   ?
[03:24] <gubuntu> make test had returned bad status, won't install without force
[03:24] <five_laptop> whats a good app for encoding a .vob to anything else?  mencode?
[03:24] <Kingsqueak> gubuntu: you are probably missing a dependency
[03:24] <ftp4you> how is ubuntu on winmodems
[03:24] <ftp4you> i used freebsd a lot and never had luck
[03:25] <alva> hi

[03:34] <bruenig> alva, anything in a config file that has a # in front of it is not read. Those #'s were in front of the extra repositories, so that command removed them, if you didn't get the first explanation

[03:35] <bruenig> alva, if you want it back to the way it was, (don't know why you would, this gives you far more packages to select from), you could do sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.old /etc/apt/sources.list

[03:40] <alva> bruenig, it seems multiverse is there, so why cant it install java?
[03:40] <bruenig> alva, do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, when it opens on the second and third line the ones that say "deb[-src]  http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted" , add the word multiverse to the end of the lines, save and then do sudo apt-get update

[03:41] <edoardo> got portmap

[03:43] <edoardo> that's what i thought, but i restarted and they didn't mount... though i didn't have portmap then : D maybe now they will : D
[03:43] <bruenig> alva, if you would add "multiverse" to the end of the second and third line, it would work

[03:53] <alva> Flannel, why is it faulty?
[03:53] <wweasel> Saulren: np :)
[03:53] <alva> Flannel, can you pleases create a NEW fresh paste for me with a proper sources.list ?
[03:53] <oht> tom47: i assumed so, but is there a way to enable that functionality with the ubuntu build?
[03:53] <gyop> wweasel hmm this means i can not use?
[03:53] <wilkin> when i do uname -r, i get my kernel version, but when I go into /usr/src and ls -l, i get 0 items
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> gyop: why not use gaim?
[03:53] <tom47> oht check out that reference above
[03:53] <wweasel> gyop: It would be like the back-end for a client. Behind the scenes. Do you need some help finding a client? I know that was one of the biggest pains for me when I switched to Ubuntu
[03:53] <oht> i compiled Rc1 myself, and everything worked fine, but the 'software update manager' kept insisting that the ubuntu pre8 build was more recent :P
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> gyop: you have to compile lmme and if yer new you may not be able to get that done
[03:54] <oht> tom: thz
[03:54] <alva> does anyone here at al have a WORKING sources list?
[03:54] <oht> *thx
[03:54] <wilkin> i'm trying to install cisco client
[03:54] <wilkin> vpn
[03:54] <dhunter> wilkin: you dont have source?
[03:54] <wweasel> Kingsqueak:  Beyond that, I think LMME is simply a backend engine, not an actual client
[03:54] <Flannel> alva: That's a correct sources.list, the AU mirror is down, o rbeing updated, or whatnot.  it's NOT a sources.list error
[03:54] <RegalEagle> What's the command to restart X?
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> wweasel: ah, heh, then that would make it hard to use
[03:54] <ftp4you> anyone here ever modified a ubuntu install cd so that you could add packages in so on install they would be there
[03:54] <alva> Flannel, can you give me one without AU?
[03:54] <wweasel> gyop: Have you tried Gaim? It's by far the most popular MSN client in linux.
[03:54] <Xenguy> Kingsqueak: he wants to use a webcam with it
[03:54] <wilkin> i've tried installing source but says that i have current
[03:55] <Flannel> alva: just go through and change all the urls, remove the au.
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> doesn't gaim do video now?
[03:55] <tuckerm> How can i get my drivers make
[03:55] <Flannel> ftp4you: you want a custom lvieCD (desktop) or Alternate CD?
[03:55] <tuckerm> back*
[03:55] <Xenguy> Kingsqueak: dunno, I would never use msn ;-)
[03:55] <gyop> wweasel:  thank you for explanation
[03:55] <NewcomerXb> I have Winblows XP on my internal HD, and after changing motherboards it hasnt functioned right. Id love to reinstall it,, but all i have is a burnt copy of the WINXP install. How can i extract the activation code? :/
[03:55] <dhunter> wilkin: what command did you use?
[03:55] <ftp4you> both would be nice
[03:55] <ftp4you> is there a program that can help
[03:55] <wilkin>  sudo apt-get install linux-source
[03:55] <alva> Flannel, ok!  removed all the .au
[03:56] <Flannel> NewcomerXb: believe it's in the registry somewhere, you might try googling around for it
[03:56] <gyop> Kingsqueak:  also thank you for helping..
[03:56] <ftp4you> i've done it with freebsd and windowsxp
[03:56] <gyop> wweasel: i want to use my webcam.. but gaim is not allow to
[03:56] <alva> Flannel, should the line with multiverse work now?
[03:56] <Flannel> ftp4you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization
[03:56] <NewcomerXb> but i cant log into windows o look at the registry... i hope i can do that from linux
[03:56] <wweasel> gyop: np. Essentially, the thing with Linux's MSN clients is that there is plenty of choice. There are 5 or so to choose between. None of them are exactly the same as Live Messenger in Windows, but they do pretty well.
[03:56] <ftp4you> they have a program that kinda helps
[03:56] <RegalEagle> What's the command to restart X?
[03:56] <wweasel> gyop: There is a gaim fork to allow webcams. I'll look up what it's called
[03:56] <ftp4you> thanks flannel
[03:56] <gyop> Hmm
[03:56] <wweasel> gyop: In terms of protocol implementation, the most advanced is aMSN.
[03:56] <tom47> startx
[03:56] <bimberi> RegalEagle: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
[03:57] <gyop> wweasel:  i tried aMSN
[03:57] <Xenguy> RegalEagle: Ctr-Alt-Bkspc, or sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[03:57] <wweasel> gyop: You just need to get over the fact that the client itself is pretty ugly if you use aMSN
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> gyop: the gaim fork isn't working yet fully
[03:57] <wweasel> Kingsqueak: Is it functional?
[03:58] <gyop> wweasel:  i installed aMSN, but i cant run. When i start it, it always stuck!!!!
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> wweasel: was only yahoo and receive only, not broadcast
[03:58] <tom47> oht its fun once you get wet lol
[03:58] <wweasel> Kingsqueak: urk.
[03:58] <wweasel> gyop: That's odd. You installed it from the repos?
[03:58] <jessid> Hello, some of you can help me, please to connect a Palm with ubuntu?
[03:59] <wilkin> any ideas?
[03:59] <oht> ;)
[03:59] <gyop> repos?
[03:59] <wweasel> gyop: apt-get or Synaptic
[03:59] <gyop> yeap
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> jessid: apt-cache search pilot | grep Palm | sort
[03:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell gyop about repos
[03:59] <gyop> to apt-get
[03:59] <ftp4you> anyone know if you can use vmware to run winxp to access winmodem for faxing dial up etc
[04:00] <gyop> i use apt-get to install
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> jessid: likely gnome-pilot or kpilot
[04:00] <ruewan> howdy peoples
[04:00] <ftp4you> probably no right do to ubuntu not reading hardware
[04:00] <wweasel> gyop: try running it from a terminal. open up a terminal and type in "amsn" - does it give you an error message?
[04:00] <tom47> jessid this may help ... http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Palm_sync_dapper
[04:00] <jessid> Kingsqueak man, that does not work
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> jessid: you didn't see a list of apps?
[04:00] <ruewan> has anyone here gotten Azureus to work
[04:00] <printk> ftp4you: i'd assume  no
[04:01] <Telroth_Plushie|> ruewan, yes
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> jessid: try  apt-cache search gnome-pilot
[04:01] <ruewan> mine keeps saying file not found when i click on a file
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> jessid: you may need to fix something before you can install this
[04:01] <Flannel> wilkin: linux-source is the vanilla (non ubuntu) source, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile will get you the current source
[04:01] <gyop> wweasel: it doesnt give any error but when i enter my password and press log-in. It's STUCK =o\ and i tried many times.
[04:01] <ftp4you> right now i use tinyxp with ubuntu running with vmware
[04:01] <jessid> Kingsqueak yes, I see the list, what I mean is that I havent been able to make the palm "talk" to ubuntu, yet
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> jessid: oh, sorry
[04:02] <wilkin> thanks Flannel, this is just starting to frustrate the heck out of me
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> jessid: o.k. so you are what, in gnome?
[04:02] <jessid> Kingsqueak ;-)
[04:02] <wweasel> gyop...hmmm..
[04:02] <jessid> Kingsqueak yes in gnome
[04:02] <jessid> i have tried kpilo and jpilot
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> jessid: when you run gnome-pilot, can it detect it at all?
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> or the others
[04:02] <wweasel> gyop: what do you mean by stuck? the program crashes? can't log in?
[04:03] <jessid> Kingsqueak nop! does not detects it...
[04:03] <ruewan> my azurues keeps saying that the file can't be found and when i browse all of the files a greyed out
[04:03] <Rug> Howdy all, I have just upgraded to Edgy, and now most of my KDE apps crash (amarok,krusader, konqueror).  I have tried to install kubuntu-desktop, but that gives me an error stating that the package is broken (xorg needs to be installed but it won't).  Suggestions (other then a nuke + reinstall?
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> jessid: try what tom47 said root@freebiemob:~# apt-cache search pilot | grep Palm
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> derp
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> sorry, bad paste buffer
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> root@freebiemob:~# apt-cache search pilot | grep Palm
[04:04] <tom47> jessid http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Palm_sync_dapper
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> damned paste
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> thnx
[04:04] <tom47> nw
[04:04] <jessid> tom47 I am in it,,,thanks!
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> man I *hate* pasting on a two-button laptop
[04:04] <wweasel> Kingsqueak: Hitting both buttons emulates a middle button
[04:05] <Rug> Kingsqueak: Ctrl+C still works
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> yeah but you have to do it fast
[04:05] <gyop> wweasel: when i press Log-In button. it freeze. There are a world. its doing fade-in and fade-out. and then There are a window within whitescreen.. when you want to close, you have you use force.
[04:05] <MicroMause> Hello
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> Rug: I always forget which is which x v c
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> Rug: not a windows guy ;-)
[04:05] <Rug> C = Copy   X = Cut   X = Paste
[04:05] <MicroMause> Is there anyway to format my HD via the live CD?
[04:05] <Flannel> V paste, he means
[04:05] <MicroMause> (First time user)
[04:05] <gyop> you have to use force*
[04:05] <Rug> ack, sorry
[04:06] <Rug> yes, V=paste.
[04:06] <Kingsqueak> that doesn't seem to work to terms
[04:06] <Rug> Kingsqueak: DOS taught me that, not Win
[04:06] <Flannel> Kingsqueak: cmd prompts you need to use the mouse. and other funky stuff
[04:06] <lemur> I like to use shift+del and shift+ins
[04:06] <lemur> it makes a lot more sense to me
[04:06] <Flannel> MicroMause: yes, the installer has a partitioner, and I'm not sure if Gparted is installed or not, but if it is, that's another way
[04:06] <Rug> Ctrl + INS for copy, Shift + INS for paste
[04:06] <Laibsch> Anybody has an idea how to fix the mess that I am after my edgy upgrade?  Further info at the support request I opened: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/2451
[04:07] <Kingsqueak> ahh shift-del and ins works in terms, thnx
[04:07] <Laibsch> s/I am/I am in/
[04:07] <Kingsqueak> now to remember that
[04:07] <wweasel> gyop: I'm not sure how to help you with that. You can try #amsn
[04:07] <xerophyte> how can i burn bin file to dvd ??
[04:07] <NewcomerXb> :< I read that to reinstall WindowsXP ill need to call in for a new activation key. I can already hear them asking me tons of questions and selling me garbage
[04:07] <wweasel> gyop: I think that's your best bet
[04:07] <MicroMause> Thanks... one last question... is there some sort of check disk type app on the live CD? (Never used Linux before)
[04:07] <NewcomerXb> microsoft should nuke itself
[04:07] <Rug> MicroMause: fsck
[04:07] <gyop> =o)) thank you for everthing wweasel =o)) thank you for your concern =o)
[04:08] <MicroMause> Thankie =)
[04:08] <NewcomerXb> fsck is the way to go
[04:08] <ruewan> hey
[04:08] <NewcomerXb> :)
[04:08] <|rt|> NewcomerXb: actually ms should be able to tell that your HD serial number hasn't changed and just issue you another key without too many questions
[04:08] <MicroMause> Windows installer crashes on me =(
[04:08] <NewcomerXb> but if you fsck a mounted disk, dont agree to move around bits and stuff
[04:08] <MicroMause> And I have no idea why
[04:08] <Rug> MicroMause: ALWAYS unmount before you fsck
[04:08] <NewcomerXb> [rt]  I see. Hmm.
[04:08] <wweasel> gyop: Np :) For webcams, aMSN is definitely your best bet, perhaps your only bet to my knowledge
[04:08] <MicroMause> Oh?
[04:08] <MicroMause> I'm on the LiveCD now
[04:08] <ruewan> i am fed up with microsoft i want to start a rebellion
[04:08] <Rug> wweasel: doesn't kopete work?
[04:09] <NewcomerXb> They should die
[04:09] <MicroMause> I'm fed up too
[04:09] <MicroMause> But... I need apps that run on it
[04:09] <wweasel> Rug: Kopete does webcams?
[04:09] <NewcomerXb> and this IS the rebellion komrades
[04:09] <Rug> wweasel: yupp
[04:09] <Xenguy> xerophyte: command-line or GUI?  ;-)
[04:09] <xerophyte> Xenguy, eitherway i got bin and cue file
[04:09] <gyop> Thank you again.. I'll install and i try it again now =o))
[04:09] <xerophyte> need to burn it
[04:09] <wweasel> oh. So gyop, you can also check out Kopete. Definitely check it out actually
[04:09] <|rt|> anyone know why an AuthUser
[04:09] <NewcomerXb> believe me micromause, other than games you should be okay
[04:09] <|rt|> er
[04:09] <gyop> Kopete hmm
[04:09] <NewcomerXb> you can even emulate many windows apps. Just not all games
[04:09] <|rt|> damn enter key...lets try that question again
[04:09] <NewcomerXb> thanks ***rug!
[04:09] <MicroMause> Well, work stuff too... you'll hate me... .NET =D
[04:10] <Xenguy> xerophyte: k3b is the GUI app I use...
[04:10] <NewcomerXb> ah thats okay, i understand .net
[04:10] <Rug> hehe
[04:10] <|rt|> anyone know why an AuthUserFile directive with Apache would be ignored?
[04:10] <xerophyte> Xenguy, i use gnome
[04:10] <Xenguy> xerophyte: so do I
[04:10] <mogul> Hello... I've just migrated from Fedora to Ubuntu.  Most things are going very well, but I've been unable to get my Thunderbird profile recognized.  I moved it into .mozilla-thunderbird, edited profiles.ini to change the directory name, and started it, only to have Thunderbird ignore it.  Any ideas?
[04:10] <NewcomerXb> Okay so, does anyone know if the activation key is all i'll need, or will i need the disk's serial? Because... i just have a burned copy here
[04:10] <Xenguy> xerophyte: command line to burn ISO images is:  growisofs -Z /dev/cdrom=____.iso
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> nautilus does a fair job of CD burning now actually
[04:10] <NewcomerXb> for WINXP that is
[04:11] <gyop> wweasel:  kopete looks great and it supports webcam
[04:11] <ruewan> i figure if i can get enough people i know to install ubuntu it would spread like a virus and eventually microsoft would fall
[04:11] <dhunter> |rt| module not loaded?
[04:11] <ruewan> unfortunately i can't get azureus to work
[04:11] <printk> NewcomerXb: we will not help you in installing an illegal copy of Windows.  Please stick to topic
[04:11] <Trainstroker> when i try to format something gparted a window of the drive pops up and i get an error. im guessing it dosnt need to popup
[04:11] <NewcomerXb> ruewan, im telling everyone i know
[04:11] <MicroMause> It's funny... xchat is free on linux, but shareware on Windows? lol
[04:11] <|rt|> dhunter: isn't that part of the core?
[04:11] <gyop> wweasel: And its huge!
[04:11] <|rt|> dhunter: if not which module would I need
[04:11] <printk> NewcomerXb: go try #windows
[04:11] <NewcomerXb> okay okay
[04:11] <Xenguy> xerophyte: FWIW you can extract from .bin/.cue with vcdxrip
[04:11] <[Relic] > fresh install now to get nvidia glx working  :)
[04:11] <eobanb> MicroMause, there are free builds for windows.
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> MicroMause: if you don't say that, people probably wouldn't use it heh
[04:11] <|rt|> dhunter: I'm not seeing any errors in the logs about a missing module

[04:11] <eobanb> info*
[04:12] <Kragnerac> Hello, I am trying to upgrade ubuntu-desktop to edgy from dapper, but it says it cannot, since xorg cannot be installed.
[04:12] <Xenguy> xerophyte: e.g.: vcdxrip -vp -b ____.bin
[04:12] <NewcomerXb> well as far as linux goes, can i reinstall ubuntu without losing stuff on my data partition?
[04:12] <dhunter> |rt| look in /etc/apache/mods_available
[04:12] <printk> NewcomerXb: sure, just don't touch that data partion and you should be set
[04:12] <NewcomerXb> because i miffed on the installation some.
[04:12] <NewcomerXb> okay :)
[04:12] <wweasel> gyop:  beacuse that's not only kopete, you also need a bunch of KDE libraries
[04:12] <dhunter> |rt| or look in /etc/apache2/mods_available
[04:12] <mike-e> what's the best way to get time to synchronize automatically with ntp?
[04:13] <eobanb> mike-e, open the date and time thing and just enable it
[04:13] <Kingsqueak> mike-e: gnome will set that up for you, there's a tool right in one of the menus
[04:13] <gyop> wweasel: hmm oke =o))
[04:13] <mike-e> i'm using xfce
[04:13] <TheoMurpse> I have just installed Edgy, and I'm trying to get Wireless working. I have a Linksys WRT54G with WEP(TKIP). How can I configure this? I go to my wireless settings and set ESSID correctly, and set the Network Password to the WEP password. However, it won't connect. What is the matter?
[04:13] <MicroMause> So I run this fsck thing from the terminal?
[04:13] <mike-e> i'm looking for either chron or an initd script
[04:13] <mike-e> cron
[04:13] <NewcomerXb> Right.
[04:13] <|rt|> dhunter: yeah i looked in mods-enabled and mods-available
[04:14] <NewcomerXb> Okay another question. How do you get codecs or Totem so it'll play all the things its supposed to?
[04:14] <NewcomerXb> *for totem
[04:14] <MicroMause> What parameter do I use to get help? =) (thanks btw)
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> mike-e: go to Applications on the launcher, -> System -> time and date
[04:14] <|rt|> dhunter: the only auth mods that aren't enabled are ldap, digest, dbm, and anon
[04:14] <wilkin> Flannel, I'm still having some problems with this...I'm just learning how to get around in linux and don't know the first thing about compiling kernels...is just a lost cause?
[04:15] <phpwner> how do i give rwx to /usr/home/FOOBAR to user FOOBAR
[04:15] <dhunter> |rt|  ok dont know
[04:15] <|rt|> dhunter: I guess I should look up what each of those do to see if any are applicable
[04:15] <eobanb> !tell NewcomerXb about restricted
[04:15] <NewcomerXb> erm
[04:15] <ruewan> i got it to work

[04:30] <Kingsqueak> TehUni: the ./configure script should have an option for that
[04:30] <at0m> irc://irc.freenode.net/#winehq  ... anyone with firefox 2.0 try clicking that... see if it says its not supported
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> TehUni: sometimes make DESTDIR=/path   works too but it depends on the Makefile
[04:30] <TehUni> Kingsqueak: how do i check?

[04:31] <TehUni> mmm, good to know. thanks.
[04:31] <MicroMause> Is there an app to test your ram?
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> TehUni: likely --prefix=/path
[04:31] <nangisan> Has anyone on here installed VMWare workstation on Ubuntu 6.10?
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> TehUni: so it would be   ./configure --with-prefix=/wherever
[04:31] <TehUni> nangisan: i've got vmware server... close.
[04:32] <nangisan> Does it work in the same principal as workstation?
[04:32] <TehUni> Kingsqueak: awesome, thanks
[04:32] <TehUni> nangisan: yup. but free.
[04:32] <RegalEagle> Ive got VMware Server on WindowsXP :/
[04:32] <nangisan> TehUni: Did you have any problems installing it?
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> vmplayer won't 'play' an installed instance from a drive right?
[04:32] <TehUni> nangisan: nope.
[04:33] <RegalEagle> Running Ubuntu on it
[04:33] <gyop> Hello..
[04:33] <nangisan> Is there any easy way to install VMWare server? Or do i have to compile it?
[04:33] <gyop> has Kopete loging? can anyone know?
[04:33] <Pelo> hello gyop
[04:34] <TehUni> nangisan: nah, just download from vmware.com
[04:34] <nangisan> and then use the scripts?
[04:34] <TehUni> you have to compile a module to match your kernel, but it takes care of that for you.

[04:36] <valehru> Hey guys, I've been trying to install my wifi card for ages.  ndiswrapper says its installed, the light in the wifi is on, however there is no eth1 in the network-manager.
[04:36] <seth1248> Is anyone else haveing the problem that nautilus crashes after clicking on video file after upgrade to edgy?
[04:36] <birdman> use chmod/chown on the directory I mount them to?
[04:37] <Lathiat> birdman: yes
[04:37] <nangisan> 100 megs nice
[04:37] <birdman> ok, so I'd need to chmod 777?

[04:38] <phpnuborn> anyone here use vmplayer with ubuntu on a windows-xp system?
[04:38] <RegalEagle> yes
[04:38] <RegalEagle> Im running it now >_>
[04:38] <RegalEagle> Though mine is misbehaving right now, not XPs fault though
[04:39] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: yes i do sometimes
[04:39] <RegalEagle> Ok so Im trying to remove kdm
[04:39] <RegalEagle> but it wont die
[04:39] <RegalEagle> How to kill?
[04:39] <RegalEagle> the Kubuntu splash screen comes up but it doesnt stop
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: /etc/init.d/kdm stop
[04:39] <RegalEagle> I cant get a terminal to come up
[04:39] <RegalEagle> Im on the splash screen
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> ah, yeah that's a pain
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> can you ssh into the system?
[04:40] <RegalEagle> No
[04:40] <RegalEagle> VMware server
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> yeah , doesn't that give it an IP of its own?
[04:40] <RegalEagle> I can kill the virt machine but that wont accomplish anything
[04:40] <RegalEagle> idk
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> ah
[04:40] <RegalEagle> I cant SSH anyways
[04:40] <phpnuborn> http://canned-os.blogspot.com/2006/10/grandmas-lamp-its-easy-enough-for.html   <<-- i'm running this vapp..  it has apache and samba.. i'm trying to connect my windows to the stuff in the vmplayer..
[04:40] <RegalEagle> I'll just kill it and retry
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: basically if you reboot that if there is a 'rescue' mode, you could disable the init script for kdm
[04:41] <nangisan> I just spent days trying to get my second monitor working in Ubuntu. Tried so many alterations with the xorg.conf file with no result.... Turns out theres one line that i had to change "nv" to "nvidia". What a bitch.
[04:41] <RegalEagle> ok
[04:41] <RegalEagle> How would I do that?
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: if the GRUB menu shows up when that virt machine starts, pick the kernel that is safe mode or rescue mode
[04:41] <phpnuborn> i can't even surf with FF in vmplayer.. help please
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: I'm just not sure if those virt images work like that or not
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> I've only ever used VMWare Workstation which is different
[04:42] <RegalEagle> They do
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> k
[04:42] <caveMan_> is it possible to attach a console to some GUI program while it's already running?
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> when you go into safe mode, just edit the script in /etc/init.d/kdm
[04:42] <_whynot_> is there a terminal command for changing school resolution?
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: the dirty/quick fix is to make the first line simply 'exit 0'
[04:43] <tom47> jl;kj
[04:43] <mister_roboto> caveMan_: no
[04:43] <_whynot_> *for changing screen resolution ...?
[04:43] <Kingsqueak> RegalEagle: then when you fix it, remove that line, the proper way to disable kdm is to use 'update-rc.d -f kdm remove'
[04:44] <RegalEagle> Kingsqueak query?
[04:44] <seth1248> Why do I get a seg fault when running gxine?
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> your nick has to be registered

[04:44] <RegalEagle> it is
[04:44] <nangisan> It's asking me if i want networking for my vmware build. should i say yes?
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> seth1248: try running it from a terminal and see if there are errors
[04:45] <jokoon> Can I set tabs in grub ?
[04:45] <seth1248> Kingssqueak: that's all I get when running it from a terminal: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

[04:46] <indref> Hello! Could somone help me with permissions.
[04:46] <phpnuborn> can anyone tell me how to make my ubuntu surf the net?
[04:46] <nangisan> phpnuborn: you'll have to be a little more percise.
[04:47] <Pelo> phpnuborn,   are you connected ?
[04:47] <indref> I'd like to simply read a folder and it's files, but they are locked out.
[04:47] <indref> Any help?
[04:47] <laynor> hi, I've upgraded to edgy, the wrong way (changing the sources.list files -_-'') and now I have some problems with ion3 and fonts. I tried to do it the right way but it says it cannot calculate the upgrade. what should I do?
[04:47] <Flannel> indref: which folder?
[04:47] <Pelo> indref,  what folder ?
[04:47] <indref> Flannel, /home/shayde/.gaim
[04:47] <Flannel> indref: and your username?
[04:47] <jokoon> I can't find any direct X options in ubuntu, where are they ?
[04:47] <phpnuborn> i load vmplayer with ubuntu on the virtual image.. i type in  www.dnsstuff.com ir can't connect..  using firefox...
[04:47] <indref> Is 'indref'
[04:48] <shutup> 'lo #ubuntu
[04:48] <Flannel> indref: and, why are you reading someone elses files?
[04:48] <indref> Flannel, Because I can?
[04:48] <phpnuborn> *i can't
[04:48] <Pelo> phpnuborn,  can you surf just using ff directly whitout loading vmplayer ?
[04:48] <funkyHat> This is really annoying...
[04:48] <Flannel> indref: obviously you can't.  Since they're probably only set to be read by their owner
[04:48] <Pelo> indref,  actualy you can'T which is hte point
[04:49] <nangisan> Alrighty I ran into a little problem during the install of VMWare server
[04:49] <indref> Flannel, Well, I'm the superuser, so everything is mine :D
[04:49] <stevej> How difficult would it be to set up a classroom full of macines to update off of the teachers machine, that is, only the teachers machine downloads from the internet, the others download .debs from the teacher.
[04:49] <wheelswitch> how long should badblocks -n take on a 320 gig disk? roughly speaking.
[04:49] <phpnuborn> no..  vmplayer is a virtual machine from vmware
[04:49] <nangisan> it says "Unable to find any instance of the super-user inetd or xinetd
[04:49] <funkyHat> When I first log in my touchpad doesn't do the stuff it should (double tap to drag, right edge scroll...)
[04:49] <nangisan> it wasnts me to install them?..
[04:49] <indref> Flannel, Yet sudo cd doesn't work.
[04:49] <Pelo> phpnuborn,  are you running ubuntu inside vmware ?
[04:49] <funkyHat> But I somehow managed to get it to work last time, I just don't know how :(
[04:49] <sizzam> nangisan: i ran into that too.   if you do 'sudo apt-get install xinetd' and then try the vmware-server installer again, it should work
[04:50] <phpnuborn> inside vmplayer.. so sort of yes to your question..
[04:50] <Pelo> phpnuborn, what kind of connection ?
[04:50] <hikenboot> hello all can anyone point me to an example of maping a directory to a windows share thru samba client?
[04:50] <indref> Flannel, Pelo Could I change the permissions using sudo chwn?
[04:50] <phpnuborn> vmplayer is a freebie from vmware
[04:50] <Pelo> indref,  it's not your folder so forget it
[04:50] <nangisan> sizzam: thanks i'll give it a try right now
[04:50] <Flannel> indref: correct.  sudo ls would, or if you want to open a shell sudo -i
[04:50] <Pelo> indref,  or ask permssion from the owner of the folder
[04:50] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: actually, you can get vmware server for free now.
[04:51] <indref> Pelo, Well, he's been evicted, so that is not possible.
[04:51] <pxlmdk> ubuntu is the best thing ever in the universe on earth.
[04:51] <Flannel> indref: you don't want to chown or chmod, just use sudo to open cat or whatnot
[04:51] <phpnuborn> any that helps me how?
[04:51] <Pelo> phpnuborn, what kind of connection ?
[04:51] <indref> Flannel, sudo cd doesn't work..
[04:51] <Acu> greetings: I would like to open a book with extension  .pdb I know for windows we use isilo - what should I use in Debian or Ubuntu to open pdb files
[04:51] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: doesn't help in the least other than you might wanna check it out some time. pelo is asking you an important question
[04:51] <Flannel> indref: correct.  Why do you need to cd though?  just give a path to the file.  sudo cat /home/whatever/.gaim/whatever
[04:52] <stevej> Acu, if I remember right, that's a Palm Database.
[04:52] <phpnuborn> my windows-xp-pro-sp2.. regular comcast cable IP address on my windows..
[04:52] <indref> Flannel, I don't know what is in /.gaim
[04:52] <bimberi> indref: cd is a bash shell internal, not a program so won't work with sudo
[04:52] <Acu> stevej: most probably
[04:52] <Pelo> phpnuborn,   dsl ? cable ? dailup ?
[04:52] <indref> Flannel, What is 'cat'
[04:52] <Flannel> indref: then sudo ls /home/whatever/.gaim  or just sudo -i
[04:52] <indref> bimberi, It's a what?
[04:53] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: did you try doing a simple bridge connection for the eth card inside ubuntu?
[04:53] <indref> Flannel, Idea..
[04:53] <phpnuborn> the vmplayer with samba loaded/running has a VMnet1 and VMnet8  virtual ethernet nic cards...
[04:53] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: sorry, i meant through vmplayer
[04:53] <bimberi> indref: it's a command built into the shell itself, not a separate executable.  There is no /usr/bin/cd .
[04:53] <indref> bimberi, Right.
[04:53] <bimberi> (or the like)
[04:54] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: just set up one of the virtual nics using a bridged connection to your computer pc
[04:54] <nangisan> sizzam: nice i'm past that point now, thanks
[04:54] <indref> Flannel, Well, that worked.
[04:54] <sizzam> nangisan: cool, you're welcome
[04:54] <phpnuborn> bridge connection?   i basically know what a bridge is.. not how to use it
[04:54] <Gorlith> sorry i know i asked before, but is there a way to get tv out working with an ATI card
[04:55] <nangisan> lol it's asking me for a serial?
[04:55] <Pelo> G'night folks
[04:55] <sharms_> phpnuborn: its an option when you create your vmware install
[04:55] <mister_roboto> phpnuborn: i can't remember the exact syntax since i'm not in vmware now. it's one of the eth types you can choose.  use bridging

[04:55] <lilywhiteman> okay ikm on ubuntu's live cd, reinstalling the thing
[04:56] <lilywhiteman> By default it says it wants to put GRUB on hd0
[04:56] <Daylighter> if I install KDE on ubuntu, can I choose between KDE and Gnome?
[04:56] <Flannel> Daylighter: yep
[04:56] <indref> Flannel, Thanks for the help, you hit the nail on the head.
[04:56] <lilywhiteman> since im running off an external HD, should i change that to sd0?
[04:56] <Daylighter> that's what I thought
[04:56] <phpnuborn> connect doesn't tell me anything..   i need..   click this.. click that.. look for this type instructions...
[04:56] <nangisan> sizzam: do you remember it asking your for a serial?
[04:56] <lilywhiteman> seeing as the partitions are sda1,2,3 anyway
[04:56] <Daylighter> I remember using peanut-linux and switching between environments
[04:56] <Flannel> Daylighter: install kubuntu-desktop, then you'll change via "session" at GDM/KDM (at login)
[04:56] <sizzam> nangisan: yes, you have to go register and get one.  it's free
[04:56] <nangisan> k
[04:57] <Daylighter> kubuntu-desktop?
[04:57] <sizzam> nangisan: just give them a junk email address
[04:57] <Flannel> Daylighter: yeah, that'll install the Kubuntu desktop package (with kde, much like ubuntu-desktop installs the gnome flavor)
[04:57] <Daylighter> oh
[04:57] <Daylighter> I just want to play with KDE, because I havent in a few version numbers
[04:58] <Daylighter> I left linux a while ago and am just now coming back
[04:58] <lilywhiteman> will my grub boot drive be sd0 instead of hd0 since im using an external?
[04:58] <skinnison> Is a SoundBlaster AudioPCI 128D equivalent to ES1370 or ES1371?
[04:58] <lilywhiteman> or should i leave it
[04:58] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: it depends on what your BIOS sees it as
[04:58] <electric_donkey> =/ Sooooo I have a dapper laptop sharing its internet connection with another box via firestarter. Is there any easy way to get ALL ports forwarded to the other box (with a few exceptions)?
[04:59] <lilywhiteman> oh dear. it lists it as a hard disk
[04:59] <fusionxn1> Anyone using NTFS-3G
[04:59] <lilywhiteman> so i suppose hd then?
[04:59] <fusionxn1> or used it
[04:59] <tom47> lilywhiteman if it works leave it alone
[04:59] <lilywhiteman> okay lets see then...
[05:00] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: to grub, everything is hd
[05:00] <lilywhiteman> ah
[05:00] <fusionxn1> Anyone using NTFS-3G or ever used it?

[05:00] <gr33npho4nix> hey has anybody else not been able to see wireless networks with intel cards in edgy
[05:00] <tom47> fusionxn1 no ... just noted it was beta and not stable
[05:01] <lilywhiteman> why does the installer fail to create an ext3 filesystem of partition 1 every time? :(
[05:01] <fusionxn1> ntfs-3g is ment to be very stable
[05:01] <gr33npho4nix> they work when added by hand, but don't show up otherwise
[05:01] <fusionxn1> i wanted to know if anyoen used it if its any good
[05:01] <Scunizi> I need grub help. Blew up my sda1 partition w/XP but still able to boot to ubuntu on sdb3... at least until I reinstall xp. Suggestions on repairing grub?

[05:02] <zach634> Gorlith: to be honest though...  don't play WoW on ubuntu, or any OS for that matter :P
[05:02] <Gorlith> i tried with wine and wasnt able to get it running, but i'll do some more looking later
[05:02] <Scunizi> Thanks
[05:02] <fusionxn1> Apparently wine is best for WoW
[05:02] <czedlitz> i play wow on ubuntu
[05:02] <skinnison> I am having problems getting sound out of a SoundBlaster AudioPCI 128D on Edgy Ubuntu.  It is getting registered as ES1371.
[05:02] <skinnison> Any suggestions?
[05:03] <zach634> skinnison: did it work in dapper?
[05:03] <lilywhiteman> "The ext3 file system creation in partition #1 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed."  Yet, i thought I set that one up pretty well. I have the partitions set up as they need to be. 15 gigs for root, 1 gig for swap, and 90 gigs ext2 data space
[05:03] <skinnison> zach634: It has never worked. 5.10 or 6.06
[05:03] <zach634> skinnison: well, I don't really have a solution, I was just curious.
[05:04] <skinnison> zach634:  Thanks anyways.
[05:04] <zach634> :P
[05:04] <fusionxn1> Anyone using NTFS-3G or ever used it?
[05:06] <hikenboot> fusionxn1, I have used it on knoppix 5.0.1 to reset admin passwords on windows servers
[05:06] <vader> fusionxn1, nope
[05:06] <fusionxn1> Any good?
[05:06] <stevej> Skinnison, It may be detecting the card correctly, Creative bought at least a chipset line frrom Ensoniq a long time ago, you may want to try debugging on the assumption that Edgy got the architecture correct.
[05:06] <lilywhiteman> Um, if my /home was originally on partition 3, and i reinstall linux in partition 1, will that mean anything in /home will get overwritten?
[05:06] <lilywhiteman> such as all my data :P
[05:06] <omV0> i got a new graphic card.. how do i make ubuntu auto-reconfigure the display settings?
[05:07] <lilywhiteman> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh   i think
[05:07] <hikenboot> lilywhiteman, no it wont overwrite the partition if you dont tell it to
[05:07] <omV0> i know with SuSE i used command "sax2"
[05:07] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - is it stable?
[05:07] <slew> hi, whats a good program to capture sound with?
[05:07] <stevej>  lilywhiteman, back up the data anyway though.
[05:07] <lilywhiteman> hikenboot bt wont it have trouble accessing suff under the "martin/" folder that used to be my login?
[05:08] <lilywhiteman> i did, just ebing careful
[05:08] <hikenboot> seems to work great at least that feature of knoppix 5.0.1 but other things are quirky on knoppix i have found like chroot and remastering crashing and such
[05:08] <tom47> lilywhiteman i always have an extra partition that i backup my /home to before doing any partition work
[05:08] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - can u create and delete files without it or feeling like it will remove any?
[05:08] <lilywhiteman> oh thats a good idea, a new partition
[05:08] <skinnison> From the postings I have found, there was an older problem with digital output to SB cards on Linux.  Is that still true?
[05:08] <tom47> lilywhiteman on a separate hard disk if possible
[05:08] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - im worried
[05:09] <lilywhiteman> well its all on dvds anyway
[05:09] <hikenboot> if you install your home directory into a different partion it wont overwrite it be carefull to not automatically configure hard drive partitoning scheme because it will overwrite the entire drive...better yet make a backup
[05:09] <crimsun> skinnison: without more details & context, that's impossible to answer.
[05:09] <lilywhiteman> i never automatically configure anyway =)
[05:09] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - 300gb :( cant
[05:09] <hikenboot> fusuionxn1 they recommend having a backup for readwrite mode
[05:10] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - is fat any slower
[05:10] <skinnison> crimsum:  What details would you need?  Ubuntu 6.10, SoundBlaster Audio PCI128D, Boston speakers....
[05:10] <hikenboot> fat wont address a 300gb drive i dont believe
[05:10] <stevej> I'm fat, and I'm pretty slow.
[05:10] <tom47> heheheh
[05:10] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - lol no FAT32
[05:10] <crimsun> skinnison: lspci -nv, amixer, tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat, cat /proc/asound/card0/ac97*/*reg
[05:11] <zach634> FAT32's slower :P
[05:11] <lilywhiteman> should i create my swap partition as linux-swap or does it matter?
[05:11] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - dam so that means im gonna have to stick with cp
[05:11] <tom47> linux-swap
[05:11] <edgy__> Hi, $ sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[05:11] <edgy__> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[05:11] <edgy__> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[05:11] <edgy__> Though uname -a shows 2.6.17-10-386 and I have installed linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-386
[05:11] <hikenboot> yes its slower and im not sure fat32 will address 300gb partition if im not mistaken
[05:11] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - whats that
[05:11] <lilywhiteman> thought so. i just jumped to that conclusion but i wanted to be sure
[05:12] <lilywhiteman> does making the swap partition bigger have any effect on performance?
[05:12] <hikenboot> fusionxn1 sorry for the confusion I was talking to the other guy about partitons
[05:12] <tom47> lilywhiteman rule of thum 1.5x RAM
[05:12] <hikenboot> what you trying to do fusionxn1
[05:12] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - ok np :) What would you recommend
[05:12] <lilywhiteman> ah thank you... woah in that case ill need a good bit
[05:13] <fusionxn1> I want to use NTFS on ubuntu safely with read and write
[05:13] <slew> hi, whats a good program to capture sound with? like to record with a microphone or line-in device?
[05:13] <skelter>  i just got kiba-dock installed, and when i start it i see something appear but it quickly drops to jsut below the screen. i asked in #ubuntu-xgl but that channel is not so well populated
[05:13] <skinnison> crimsun: That's an awful lot of information for an IRC post?  What is the best way to summarize it?
[05:13] <vader> slew, I use audacity
[05:13] <hikenboot> if you want stable the most stable thing i have found believe it or not is pclinuxos second stability wise is ubuntu but not sure pclinuxos supports  ntfs-3g
[05:13] <crimsun> skinnison: pastebin
[05:13] <crimsun> (see topic)
[05:14] <slew> vader, thanks i'll give it a shot
[05:14] <hikenboot> fusionxn1 read write is still experimental
[05:14] <zach634> !pastebin > skinnison
[05:14] <vader> slew, np
[05:14] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - i know but i was told ntfx-3g was stable
[05:14] <tom47> !grub > tom47
[05:14] <lilywhiteman> woah, resizing takes forever
[05:14] <Daylighter> the first version of linux I used was Peanut linux. I had an old 100mhz AMD machine I needed to find a use for. I got on the internet and browsed and everything. It was nice. So now I'm in love with linux!
[05:15] <zach634> !life > zach634
[05:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about life - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:15] <hikenboot> well I would make frequent backups still is my opinion i have used it to reset admin passwords on boxes that needed data taken off them  but never really used them in production afterwards
[05:15] <fusionxn1> hikenboot - 300gig i cant backup
[05:15] <RegalEagle> When installing Ubuntu, on the Configuring xserver-xorg, when it says keep only resolutions you're going to use. Does that mean * the ones I want or * the ones I DONT want?
[05:15] <lilywhiteman> 300 gigs are tough to backup alright lol
[05:15] <fusionxn1> ya lol
[05:16] <Zirjoker> how do i make wget get all the files to the same directory??
[05:16] <Flannel> RegalEagle: the ones you want
[05:16] <lilywhiteman> i would take the drive out and put a new one in :D
[05:16] <zach634> how much of that do you really NEED to back up?
[05:16] <lilywhiteman> and just call that backup
[05:16] <lilywhiteman> then switch later
[05:16] <RegalEagle> So I put a * by the ones I want?
[05:16] <RegalEagle> Flannel: * the ones I want?
[05:16] <hikenboot> fusionxn1 get a second drive
[05:17] <fusionxn1> i got 2 totalling 300gb
[05:17] <fusionxn1> 3rd is 320 for os
[05:17] <lilywhiteman> hmm
[05:17] <Flannel> RegalEagle: believe so, yes.
[05:17] <lilywhiteman> can you burn data dvds?
[05:17] <RegalEagle> ok >_>
[05:17] <fusionxn1> only thing stopping me from linux
[05:17] <Zirjoker> how do i make wget get all the files to the same directory??
[05:17] <lilywhiteman> well linux is highly unlikely to eat files.
[05:17] <lilywhiteman> how about getting an external as i did. thats a nice way ^_^
[05:18] <lilywhiteman> and cheap
[05:18] <zach634> or ya know, each gmail account comes with 2gb of space...
[05:18] <zach634> wink wink
[05:18] <Flannel> !backup
[05:18] <ubotu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi
[05:18] <specialbuddy> is there a way to set up beryl on kubuntu?
[05:18] <Flannel> specialbuddy: ask in #beryl

[05:20] <Keyseir> Is it possible to install .net through wine?

[05:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about getting a job. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:21] <lilywhiteman> ouch keyseir
[05:21] <hikenboot> figure it this way how much is your 300gb of data worth to you?
[05:21] <Keyseir> I couldn't resist =(
[05:21] <lilywhiteman> uboto knows nothing of jobs
[05:22] <tom47> steve will be delighted
[05:22] <fusionxn1> Haha not funny, its a lot of money - i have more priorites
[05:22] <lilywhiteman> im happy with my 150 gig external ^_^
[05:23] <lilywhiteman> i dont need all those gigs. I can be very efficient
[05:23] <lilywhiteman> which i think i mispelled
[05:23] <tom47> ubotu please tell Keyseir about running up flags to see who salutes
[05:23] <Keyseir> Hm, seagate barracuda 750 GB for 380$ on newegg

[05:26] <RetiredComet> g'night all .. Little bash question .. I'm building this new box for my dad. He's got dial up and I can not test that from here at my house. I would like to write a simple bash script he can run to make XP the default if the dial up doesn't work on here. I thought about sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst .. but he still has to edit the default # .. can I make this update that default # by simple running the script?
[05:26] <caveMan_> would I risk data loss if I was to write on NTFS partitions from linux? or is the driver mature enough
[05:26] <Maurox> viva el monstruo :P
[05:27] <zach634> retiredcomet: make two menu.lst 's and have the script copy the right one to boot/grub
[05:27] <RetiredComet> zach634: good idea .. and simple too .. thank much ..
[05:27] <zach634> np
[05:27] <tom47> caveman afaik ntfs writing is in beta only and NOT recommended for production situations
[05:27] <[Relic] > any way to make a large batch of apt-gets run?  just installed fresh but need to get back to all the utils and stuff I had before the nvidia madness  :)
[05:28] <zach634> Relic: apt get will get all packages seperated by spaces
[05:28] <zach634> but you'd have to specify them all
[05:29] <[Relic] > wsa hoping I could pull of some sort of shell script so I could simply do search and replace for the list I made  :)
[05:29] <edgy__> Hi, Isn't it a bit strange that nvidia-glx in edgy is compiled for version 2.6.17.6 where edgy kernel is not 2.6.17-10
[05:29] <mikedoty> I can't get the Switch user function to work ... it has worked previously.  When I try to switch user, it teasingly offers me my other profile, but when I double click it, screen goes black again, then just comes back and tells me to enter my password to log back into my primary profile
[05:29] <mikedoty> Any ideas?
[05:29] <zach634> Relic: probably a way to do it, but I dont know
[05:29] <lilywhiteman> can i change around which partitions i want to be named sd1,sd2 and such?
[05:30] <tom47> no
[05:30] <lilywhiteman> o.o
[05:30] <bradley> when i wake my screen from black it asks for a password it's off in the screensaver area. where else should i look to turn it off?
[05:30] <lilywhiteman> ... why not?
[05:30] <tom47> but you can mount them on meaningfully named places
[05:30] <zach634> Relic: but in the time it would take you to make a shell script, you could probably just copy them over by hand...  unless the list happens to be long
[05:31] <lilywhiteman> I see
=== james__ is now known as daylighter
[05:31] <daylighter> ooh
[05:31] <mister_roboto> mikedoty: sounds like you're getting an error on the login for the other profile
[05:31] <mister_roboto> mikedoty: anything in the xorg log?
[05:31] <[Relic] > zach634: 1330  :)
[05:31] <lilywhiteman> so now my root is going to be partition 3, which is at the begninning of the disk. thats... odd
[05:31] <mister_roboto> mikedoty: or messages?
[05:31] <lilywhiteman> i take it linux wont be bothered by this too much?
[05:31] <tom47> not in the slightest
[05:31] <lilywhiteman> okay, lol. just names i guess
[05:32] <zach634> Relic:  ouch...   add 7 more to that list and it shall be awesome
[05:32] <mikedoty> Oh you know
[05:32] <lilywhiteman> okay i made a neat backup partition (yay)
[05:32] <mikedoty> Maybe it's because I have set 32bpp to default color depth and it doesn't like that
[05:32] <caveMan_> "The day Microsoft makes something that doesn't suck is the day they start

[05:34] <zach634> lilywhiteman: when in doubt, sudo and chmod
[05:34] <lilywhiteman> how can i sudo so that i can drag them over graphically? any way?
[05:34] <Flannel> zach634, lilywhiteman, no.  chmod is the best way to screw up your system. (well, second to chown)
[05:34] <lilywhiteman> id like to use this gui since its up
[05:34] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: gksudo nautilus, just be careful.
[05:34] <blinky> my friend helped me set up beryl the other day, but he made my session aiglx, how can i change it back to glx? I get lots of bugs and etc in aiglx and apparently this fixed it for him
[05:34] <tom47> very very careful
[05:35] <lilywhiteman> gksudo nautilus? that gives me full access?
[05:35] <zach634> aww, i like chmod
[05:35] <zach634> it solves all my problems!
[05:35] <Flannel> zach634: go ahead and break your system, don't break other peoples.
[05:35] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: yes
[05:35] <zach634> bah
[05:35] <lilywhiteman> okay. I can see how that might be dangerous
[05:35] <lilywhiteman> but ill only use it to copy files. how do i turn it off when im done
[05:35] <blinky> xgl not glx**
[05:35] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: just close the nautilus window
[05:36] <mikedoty> Ok, yeah, it's definitely the 32bpp attempt, it just fails.  Back to 16, it's ok.  I'll have to check those logs for fun though
[05:37] <lilywhiteman> it says "volume monitering will not work" :(

[05:39] <Shaezsche> why do so many programs in ubuntu keep a file history in their menus?
[05:39] <tom47> lilywhiteman what i do usually is to create a folder/directory in the new partition and then change the ownership of that so i can readily copy stuff to it
[05:39] <Shaezsche> and there are no options not to?
[05:40] <lilywhiteman> okay... how shall i go about this

[05:46] <Shaezsche> its not gthumb
[05:46] <Shaezsche> its EYE of GNOME
[05:46] <bimberi> Shaezsche: yes it is too, apologies
[05:47] <Shaezsche> bimberi its ridiculus i cannot get rid of the history

[05:48] <boozey> what ftp server can i use for ubuntu that i just install and it reads by linux users accounts and gives each linux user ftp access to there home folder?

[05:51] <bimberi> Flannel: default Ubuntu image viewer
[05:51] <hFTW> hi, i got my /boot removed, what are my options?
[05:51] <bimberi> !offtopic | roycebarber
[05:51] <ubotu> roycebarber: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[05:51] <lilywhiteman> as in your root?
[05:51] <hFTW> yea
[05:51] <lilywhiteman> well you probably didnt lose data then, just the files for the program
[05:52] <hFTW> ok thats good
[05:52] <lilywhiteman> i would simply reinstall to that partition
[05:52] <Gorlith> i dont think i got a responce before, has anyone gotten tv/video out to work with an ati card?
[05:52] <hFTW> and would that save my data lilywhiteman
[05:52] <verma> is there a way to reset my KDE wallet password?
[05:52] <lilywhiteman> The guys here told me its a good idea to backup just in case, but i dont think there's much risk if your data's on its own partition
[05:52] <Flannel> verma: probably.  ask in #kubuntu
[05:53] <lilywhiteman> however, if you just have one big partition... i dunno, what do you think guys?
[05:53] <Falcongrinder> ahh, help
[05:53] <Flannel> hFTW: reinstall, you'll mount, but not reformat your home partition
[05:53] <verma> Flannel: I did :) .. people aren't paying attention
[05:53] <acan> hoola tengo un problen  con xgl  mis bordes de pantalla saltan
[05:53] <lilywhiteman> right, just dont auto-install it, that auto-erasses
[05:53] <hFTW> Flannel, sorry i'm a begginer
[05:53] <hFTW> not sure how
[05:53] <Halpo> what mpeg decoder does the movie player use? as per XviD decoding?
[05:54] <lilywhiteman> Im with you hFTW, only linuxed for 2 weeks now
[05:54] <hFTW> cool lilywhiteman
[05:54] <Gorlith> also i have 2 partitions, one with /root etc... and one with /home in it. my hd is 80gb, how big should the /root partition be, and if i resize it will i lose settings and programs?
[05:54] <Falcongrinder> i added the flash 7 player to firefox and now when I try to start up firefox it doesnt
[05:54] <RetiredComet> (09:44:31 PM) Flannel: RetiredComet: how is it installed? .. the modem?
[05:54] <hFTW> ok, so my setup is a 30g windows, and 30g linux, i havent rebooted YET
[05:54] <Syco54645> did dapper get rid of the install cd and live cd as a different thing?  are they one cd now?
[05:54] <Halpo> Syco54645: yes
[05:54] <lilywhiteman> right now im reinstalling. Im having issues with it because o fmy setup, so im redoing all partitions except the one with my data
[05:55] <Flannel> RetiredComet: er... mustve been a bad nickcomplete.
[05:55] <lilywhiteman> but now i think it wasnt installing because i didnt unmount the drives first c.c
[05:55] <Madpilot> bimberi, Flannel - EoG is the old viewer - from Breezy - I thought Dapper  & Edgy used gThumb?
[05:55] <RetiredComet> Flannel: lol .. I missed it all anyhow, just saw my nic highlighted ..
[05:55] <hFTW> Flannel, do i just reinstall from within ubuntu or what?
[05:55] <Halpo> what mpeg decoder does the totem use?
[05:55] <Syco54645> Halpo: ah ok.  my friend is an idiot and trying to install ubuntu but he says when he finishes the install that it deletes from his harddrive when it is done installing...  i know he is doing something wrong, and i highly doubt he is even remotely doing it right (or that it is deleting from the hdd)
[05:56] <Flannel> hFTW: how much did you delete?
[05:56] <hFTW> the boot
[05:56] <hFTW> folder
[05:56] <bimberi> Syco54645: shipit sends you a Desktop (Live) CD which can also install. The alternate is a text-mode installer but only available as an ISO
[05:56] <hFTW> rm /boot is all that happened
[05:56] <bimberi> Madpilot: seems to be EoG here (Dapper)
[05:56] <Falcongrinder> anyone have problems with macromedia flash 7?
[05:56] <lilywhiteman> that cant be good hftw o.o
[05:56] <Linuturk> any of you drive experts want to try your hands at this? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1755579#post1755579 << last post by me
[05:57] <bunnu> ne one knows how to install tftp server on ubunt
[05:57] <Madpilot> bimberi, odd - but then, I'd switched to gThumb back in Hoary, so no longer have a default system
[05:57] <Halpo> Syco54645: he is probably just loading the cd in, thinking it is installing the OS, then when he reboots it unloads the live part, so he thinks it deletes the installed OS that he never really installed
[05:57] <Syco54645> bimberi: well he is confused by mountpoints, and i cant exactly go over there and fix it for him
[05:57] <Flannel> hFTW: just /boot?  hmm.  you... first off, shouldn't have been runnign as root ;)  second... hmm.  You might try removing the kernel, reinstalling, then reinstalling grub.  You might be able to salvage that way.
[05:57] <Syco54645> Halpo: that is what i said, but he is arguing with me that it did install.  i asked him if it took more than 10 minutes to install and he says he has a really fast computer
[05:57] <lilywhiteman> lol
[05:58] <hFTW> Flannel, can i use some1 else's boot folder
[05:58] <Linuturk> Falcongrinder, I had a good amount of problems with flash 7, but flash 9 beta is out, and it worked beautifully on Dapper and Edgy for me
[05:58] <Falcongrinder> can anyone lend a quick hand?
[05:58] <tom47> hFTW if you have unbacked up data in /home back it up now before anything is what i would be doing
[05:58] <tonyyarusso> If there's anybody with Flash 9 installed, I'm looking for a volunteer to try a site that won't work for me with 7 and let me know what it says if it works on 9.
[05:58] <Linuturk> tonyyarusso, shoot, I got 9
[05:58] <rredd4> to ssh into my desktop from my laptop, do I type  ssh (ipaddress)  then type in the login and password?
[05:58] <Flannel> hFTW: I'm not really sure how that all works.  Just don't turn off your computer, once you do, you won't be able to boot.
[05:58] <Halpo> speaking of bootloaders...I haven't seen your whole conversation, but how do you edit GRUBs menu?
[05:58] <tonyyarusso> Linuturk: http://www.peterboroughvotes.ca/, the results, specifically, percentages for mayor
[05:58] <hFTW> Flannel, rofl, k
[05:58] <Falcongrinder> liniturk, did firefox not load
[05:59] <Madpilot> Falcongrinder, Flash 7 has a number of known bugs on Linux
[05:59] <Flannel> rredd4: yeah, it'll prompt you for username and password.  Unless your ssh program uses your current uesrname, in which case you'll need to give it an option, if you have a different one there.
[05:59] <Rug> Howdy all, I have just upgraded to Edgy, and now most of my KDE apps crash (amarok,krusader, konqueror).  I have tried to install kubuntu-desktop, but that gives me an error stating that the package is broken (xorg needs to be installed but it won't).  Suggestions (other then a nuke + reinstall?
[05:59] <lilywhiteman> lol my history professor wants me to burn him ubuntu so he can try it
[05:59] <Rug> lilywhiteman: gotta love brownie points!
[05:59] <Linuturk> Falcongrinder, do what?
[05:59] <Syco54645> is there an install guide for ubuntu dapper that i can point him to?
[05:59] <ludovicus> hey all, i'm having issues with firefox... any body have a clue on how to fix firefox.. i'm using opera now
[05:59] <tonyyarusso> lilywhiteman: I set up one of the stands from the DIYMarketing wiki page in the physics building.  Might give that a shot
[06:00] <Falcongrinder> so if I uninstall flash 7 I should be able to load firefox??
[06:00] <lilywhiteman> cool :)
[06:00] <rredd4> Flannel  how do i know if my ssh my current username?
[06:00] <lilywhiteman> i get so many people who are like "its free? how is it free? how do they make money?"
[06:00] <rredd4> Flannel how can i check that ssh is installed?
[06:00] <lilywhiteman> and even "i thought windows came with pcs already"
[06:00] <Linuturk> Falcongrinder, well, if flash7 is crashing it, possibly. but you might have deeper issues
[06:00] <tonyyarusso> lilywhiteman: I have an explanatory page as well that you can set beside it.
[06:00] <Falcongrinder> i even tried reinstalling firefox through synaptic
[06:00] <Rug> tonyyarusso: it works for me
[06:00] <rredd4> Flannel synaptic?
[06:00] <Linuturk> tonyyarusso, it is taking a while to load on my slow connection
[06:01] <lilywhiteman> a huh? :)
[06:01] <Flannel> rredd4: what?  ssh ins't installed by default, you'll need to sudo apt-get install ssh to install the server
[06:01] <UKMatt> I'm trying to connect a digital camera to Ubuntu to transfer pictures, it worked before a reformat but hasn't since, can anyone think of a package that I may be missing and need installed for it to recognize?
[06:01] <Flannel> rredd4: or synaptic, sure.
[06:01] <rredd4> ok
[06:01] <tonyyarusso> Rug: Want to pm me the numbers?
[06:02] <Linuturk> heh, my camera is awesome with ubuntu. it puts it on an sd card, and my laptop has an sd reader built in that is plug and play ;p
[06:02] <Flannel> rredd4: ssh uses your normal user account login info.  So, like if you had a "tom" account on your server, and you were "bill" on your client computer, some ssh clients will assume you want to log in as "bill", you may need to override that
[06:02] <Rug> ack
[06:02] <tonyyarusso> lilywhiteman: That sheet is at http://www.tonyyarusso.is-a-geek.com/stuff/ubuntu-letter.odt
[06:02] <KDan> where does the 'php' binary go in a standard server ubuntu install? I can't seem to find it
[06:02] <lilywhiteman> lol love your website name
[06:02] <Rug> tonyyarusso: Join #vote
[06:03] <Linuturk> tonyyarusso, heh, I have a friend with a similar site name; the is-a-geek.com part, anyway
[06:03] <Acu> Hey guys I have a pdb book and I cannot open it - any hint ?
[06:03] <tonyyarusso> Linuturk: Basic free dynamic dns
[06:03] <lilywhiteman> sweet thanks
[06:03] <Flannel> Acu: probably a Palm format
[06:04] <ludovicus> so the present recommendation to fix firefox is to remove and rienstall?
[06:04] <hFTW> ludovicus, get swiftfox
[06:05] <lilywhiteman> okay. Mission backup: accomplished @.@ now to install if i can. oy
[06:05] <Acu> Flannel: yes it might be a Palm format, but how the heck I can open it in linux?
[06:05] <Flannel> KDan: you mean like /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so?
[06:05] <UKMatt> any ideas on camera connecting?
[06:06] <caveMan_> what NTFS driver is regarded as safer, captive ntfs or ntfs-3g?
[06:06] <ludovicus> swiftfox...
[06:06] <Flannel> Acu: no idea, look for a linux palm book reader (although, there are a few palm formats)
[06:06] <KDan> Flannel: I want to use the CLI
[06:06] <KDan> for a cron job
[06:07] <KDan> have the LAMP set of packages installed (from the 6.06 server install)
[06:07] <Flannel> KDan: you need to install php5-cli then
[06:07] <matthew_w> HELP!  udev won't allow my ubuntu to boot, I get invalid sysfs and stuff
[06:07] <ludovicus> wha'ts the repository for swiftfox
[06:07] <KDan> aha
[06:07] <KDan> apt-get php5-cli?
[06:07] <KDan> er
[06:07] <KDan> apt-get install
[06:07] <Flannel> KDan: sudo apt-get install php5-cli
[06:08] <KDan> sweet. thanks :-)
[06:08] <tom47> Flannel ru sure you are ok with that earlier suggestion with a separate folder?
[06:08] <Flannel> tom47: yeah, I just saw you chmodding something that looked like it was the HD mounted from a liveCD, then later read your earlier posts
[06:09] <wheelswitch> how long should badblocks -n take on a 320 gig disk? roughly speaking.
[06:09] <tom47> ah good coz i was a bit ummmm intimidated lol
[06:09] <ludovicus> halo... i messaged uboto '/msg uboto swiftfox' and i got nothing
[06:09] <ludovicus> anybody know a repository?
[06:09] <tom47> Flannel cool now
[06:10] <Flannel> ludovicus: ubotu, but he doesn't know anyhting about swiftfox.  Swiftfox doesn't have a repository.
[06:10] <lilywhiteman> if i choose to mount the backup partition as /home/backup/ will that work?
[06:10] <lilywhiteman> or should i just leave it blank and use it manually
[06:10] <ludovicus> apt-cache search swiftfox gives me nothing
[06:10] <Flannel> ludovicus: that's because it's not in a repository.
[06:11] <ludovicus> so how do i get it
[06:11] <lilywhiteman> if i dont hcoose a mount point for a backup patrition, can i still access it via media/ ?
[06:11] <ludovicus> is there a *.deb package or source out there?
[06:12] <lilywhiteman> what say you Tom47 ol pal? XD
[06:12] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: you'll have to mount it later
[06:12] <lilywhiteman> ah okay. i guess if its backup i may as well do it that way
[06:12] <Flannel> lilywhiteman: that'll guarentee it's not touched during install

[06:16] <sephrys> ali5451 sound, needs to hook up with the joystick
[06:16] <sephrys> how do i do it/

[06:18] <jajajajaja> ello, when I try to upgrade to edgy from dapper, I get an error about it not being upgradeable since it cannot install xorg... Does anyone know what the problem and solution is?
[06:19] <CPrgmSwR2> except its linux and linux
[06:19] <CPrgmSwR2> in this case
[06:19] <CPrgmSwR2> I no longer use windows
[06:22] <caveMan_> I messed up my mouse settings and I can't get them just right again. is there any way I can revert back to default?
[06:22] <tom47> CPrgmSwR2 ... dual boot is ok bt i find using say vmware server allows me to access multiple OS' without the pain of booting between them

[06:23] <KDan> how do i ask apt-get which packages matching a certain name are installed?
[06:24] <bimberi> KDan: dpkg -l | grep name
[06:24] <matthew_w> Hey guys, udevtest /dev/hda1 gives me a variety of INVALID RESULT and INVALID SYSFS operations, what does this mean, it's preventing me from booting.
[06:24] <KDan> cheers
[06:25] <bimberi> np :)
[06:26] <matthew_w> It;s really terrible, I can't boot except into recovery mode X_X
[06:27] <KDan> hmm. So I have php5 installed as both a cli module and as a libapache2 module, and i have php5-mysqli installed too... yet only the libapache2 module seems to pick up the mysqli stuff... any suggestions?
[06:28] <daylighter> Ahhh!!!!!!!
[06:28] <Centaur5> How can I make Edgy stop reporting messages from syslog in a terminal I have open?
[06:28] <daylighter> I uninstalled KDE, but I'm still getting the detatched KDE menu bars that pop up transparently underneath the panel at the top of the screen... any ideas?
[06:30] <daylighter> do you know what I mean by "detatched menus"
[06:31] <KDan> ok, nevermind, got it.
[06:31] <cfedde> for some reason C can't include linux/string.h
[06:32] <cef> anyone using inkscape? I can't seem to get printing working (on dapper). Printer works and I can print through other apps as well as the test page.
[06:33] <Gorlith> i have a small question, im using gaims irc right now, is there a good standalone irc client?
[06:33] <cfedde> for some reason C can't include linux/string.h. included from /usr/include/asm-i386/io.h
[06:33] <caveMan_> is it possible to have eye of gnome cycle through the images in the directory with mouse wheel?
[06:37] <protocol1> Gorlith, try xchat
[06:37] <Gorlith> cool i'll take a look
[06:38] <daylighter> Can anyone help me? my gnome is borked after I installed/uninstalled KDE
[06:38] <printk> daylighter: we need more details... what specifically is wrong?
[06:38] <daylighter> ok
[06:38] <daylighter> well, you know how KDE has the menu bars of apps in the upper left hand corner of the screen?
[06:39] <daylighter> now gnome is doing that, but they're transparent and appear underneath the panel I have at the top of the screen
[06:39] <printk> move the one on top temp... right click on those panels you don't want and select "Remove panel"
[06:39] <printk> then move the one back and you should be set
[06:40] <printk> or maybe it's "Delete this panel"
[06:40] <daylighter> but
[06:41] <daylighter> they arent gnome panels
[06:41] <cef> bah. figured it. Inkscape's default print setup was set to 'lp' instead of '| lp' (ie: pipe to lp)
[06:41] <daylighter> do you want a screenshot?
[06:41] <daylighter> it's really weird
[06:42] <cge> Does anyone know if there is a way to use network-manager without having a fd.o systray?
[06:43] <PupUser9598a4> Windows killed my MBR. How do I get GRUB back?
[06:43] <Falcongrinder> I just completely removed firefox and reinstalled it.  It should be loading right?
[06:43] <Falcongrinder> im stumped
[06:44] <printk> PupUser9598a4: boot ubuntu with your install cd or any live cd.  Mount your partitions and then grub-install /dev/<your_hdisk>
[06:44] <Born_In_Xixax> hi all, having strange network problem...has worked fine for weeks, now i can ping hosts by IP address or via hostname (resolving), but no other protocol will connect (http, telnet, etc.) any thoughts?
[06:44] <pod> +
[06:45] <daylighter> printk, do you want to see a screenshot?
[06:45] <cge> printk, Err, I'm pretty sure you need to do grub-install /dev/<your_hdisk> --root-directory=/path/to/root, right?
[06:45] <cge> printk, Otherwise it won't be able to find /boot and install stage2
[06:45] <printk> daylighter: sure
[06:46] <printk> cge: oh hrm, i never have used that before heh
[06:46] <printk> cge: and it works for me... then again i have / and /boot on the same partition
[06:46] <daylighter> look in the upper left, you can barely see it against the background
[06:46] <printk> oh wait i'm behind firewall, can't dcc
[06:46] <Born_In_Xixax> wireshark shows a huge number of TCP ZeroWindow keepalive packets going to an IP that I don't recognize (it's not a DNS server)
[06:47] <cge> printk, Oh, I see. You meant using the livecd to boot into your normal system. You only need the --root-directory if your /boot is actually somewhere else. For example, if you booted into the LiveCD and then mounted root at /mnt/target.
[06:47] <printk> cge: ohhhhh ..... yah i see now.  I usually use chroot.  I should have specified that tho :)
[06:47] <printk> --root-directory is probably alot easier
[06:48] <daylighter> no dcc?
[06:48] <printk> daylighter: nope
[06:48] <daylighter> oh ok

[06:51] <Born_In_Xixax> hmm, a random google post suggest that host is associated with the ubuntu archives
[06:51] <Born_In_Xixax> spoofing?
[06:51] <eobanb> Born_In_Xixax, it's an ubuntu apt mirror.
[06:51] <Falcongrinder> alright. I've got a real odd problem.  Neither firefox nor galeon will load. any ideas?
[06:52] <printk> daylighter: looks like your running in "OSX Mode"... i.e. your apps menus will show up there
[06:52] <Crankymonky> try from the CLI
[06:52] <Born_In_Xixax> yes thanks, must be the update manager trying to poll the apt archives
[06:52] <printk> daylighter: trying to remember how to change that
[06:52] <Crankymonky> Falcongrinder, open one from the terminal and see what error you get
[06:52] <daylighter> oh joy
[06:53] <eobanb> printk, 'OS X mode'?
[06:53] <sephrys> sidewinder gamepad?
[06:53] <Falcongrinder> thanks, ill try that now
[06:53] <sephrys> get it workie work??
[06:53] <printk> eobanb: lol, whatever it's called when your apps menus show up on a panel rather than on the app itself.  I.e. like in OSX
[06:54] <ConfusedLilyboy> *cries for help* Why wont linux install ? It keeps saying i didnt set a filesystem for partition 3... but how could that be
[06:54] <luminousnerd> Hola
[06:54] <eobanb> printk, is there a way to do that in gnome?
[06:54] <printk> eobanb: yah
[06:54] <eobanb> printk, oh really? how
[06:54] <luminousnerd> Is it normal when I boot up for the Ubuntu bar to bounce back and forth for a very very long time?
[06:54] <printk> i've done it, but i have no idea how and how i removed it heh
[06:54] <Staz> Is there an easier way to end a screen session other than killing all its windows?
[06:55] <luminousnerd> I have a normally fast computer, and the extreme slowness of the livecd is scaring me...
[06:55] <Staz> or c-a :quit
[06:55] <luminousnerd> I know it will be faster once loaded onto the system, but thus far it has frozen up twice

[06:55] <luminousnerd> lol yea
[06:56] <luminousnerd> 2GB

[06:56] <pxlmdk> born that's the minimum huh a 128 and a 64?
[06:56] <darkmatter> printk, the menubar hack??? you need to roll back your gtk version to the hackfree repo build.... ps... thats a really dirty hack btw ;)
[06:56] <Born_In_Xixax> i've not been able to get the live cd to boot with under 192mb
[06:56] <Born_In_Xixax> though the alternate text mode works fine
[06:56] <luminousnerd> Well it boots
[06:56] <ConfusedLilyboy> how come i have partition #3 set up in the parted as ext2, but it keeps saying there is no set file system for it when i try to instal!?
[06:56] <luminousnerd> I can get into Gnome and whatnot
[06:56] <pxlmdk> cool. good to know.
[06:57] <JJGotit> help-me with winmodems
[06:57] <ConfusedLilyboy> and whats this crap The ext3 file system creation in partition #2 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed.
[06:57] <luminousnerd> It froze when trying to manually partition.  And it's going generally extremely slow.
[06:57] <daylighter> darkmatter - this is happening after I uninstalled KDE
[06:57] <printk> darkmatter: no, i didn't change any repos or add any hacks... maybe i'm thinking of something else *shrugs* :P
[06:57] <darkmatter> O_O
[06:57] <luminousnerd> I come from Slackware so this graphical stuff is new (and pretty cool) to me
[06:57] <printk> daylighter: and you can't just remove that panel when you right click o n it?
[06:57] <ConfusedLilyboy> billion internets to whoever can help me
[06:57] <daylighter> http://i10.tinypic.com/2qbbo0w.png <-- this, darkmatter
[06:57] <daylighter> no, because it considers it to be part of the konversation window
[06:57] <Born_In_Xixax> luminous, if all else fails get the alternate cd
[06:58] <luminousnerd> alternate?
[06:58] <luminousnerd> stable version?
[06:58] <darkmatter> ok... you still have the kde osx menu after uninstall... hmm...I'm just trying to remember which rc file those settings are in
[06:58] <Born_In_Xixax> yes, there is the 'Live CD' iso, and the 'Alternate Install' iso
[06:58] <JJGotit> help-me with winmodems...
[06:58] <darkmatter> (no KDE currently installed)
[06:58] <JJGotit> help please...
[06:58] <pxlmdk> partition manager was the only part of installing and configuring ubuntu at least till now that hasn't inspired awe in me. :D
[06:59] <Born_In_Xixax> the alternate iso has a text mode installer for regular ubuntu, i've had luck with it on systems where the livecd would not run well
[06:59] <bimberi> luminousnerd: no same version, just uses the classic text-mode installer so can be less problematic for some
[06:59] <daylighter> indeed,
[06:59] <luminousnerd> I see
[06:59] <darkmatter> pxlmdk, fdisk is better :P
[06:59] <luminousnerd> Okay guess I'll try it again
[06:59] <luminousnerd> and then try that
[06:59] <ConfusedLilyboy> how do you run fsck on a live disk?
[06:59] <sharms_> ConfusedLilyboy: reboot with a cd.
[06:59] <ConfusedLilyboy> it just gives me the version number
[07:00] <ConfusedLilyboy> oh.
[07:00] <pxlmdk> lol dark it is.
[07:00] <ConfusedLilyboy> there's no way i can scan it right here in gnome?
[07:00] <luminousnerd> How far off are we from Linux being as easy for n00bs as Windows is, just curious if anyone has an idea.  because I'm sick of windows and I want to see Linux brought to the masses!  Ubuntu seems to be closest
[07:00] <pxlmdk> luminous, that is what i'm talking aboiut.. i have installed windows.. 5 or 10 times or something.
[07:00] <pxlmdk> i had never installed linux before.. it was a breeze.
[07:01] <pxlmdk> i am pimping it on everyone i know.
[07:01] <luminousnerd> But it's giving me issues and I'm pretty well-versed in computers
[07:01] <pxlmdk> luminous yah ok. i guess that's the thing i was somewhat lucky.
[07:02] <Cernunnos> hello
[07:02] <luminousnerd> Okay so I don't get this graphical prepare disk space window
[07:02] <daylighter> it wouldnt quite be so bad but this "osx menu" is transparent
[07:02] <darkmatter> daylighter... I'll look up the kde docs n see which rc file that setting is in.... it may take a bit though
[07:02] <eobanb> luminousnerd, i'd say it's basically as easy to use as windows.
[07:02] <luminousnerd> I have 2 partitions already, how do I install into the second one?
[07:02] <Cernunnos> short question, what *application name* i have to use to catch mozilla thunderbird with devilspie?
[07:02] <pxlmdk> luminous, here's what you do, backup your disk first, and say "BWHAHAHAHA windows sux" and partition 100%. :) .. that's all i can recommend anyhow.
[07:02] <darkmatter> daylighter... or you could install kcontrol
[07:03] <daylighter> ah yes
[07:03] <daylighter> how would I go about that
[07:03] <pxlmdk> i bet darkmatters idea is better.
[07:03] <darkmatter> you can change the setting graphically from there
[07:03] <eobanb> luminousnerd, you want to manually partiton; remove the partition on which you want to install, and then tell it to use the largest free space.
[07:03] <luminousnerd> eobanb, I wouldn't :( I really wish I could but it just isn't as easy.  It's definitely better in almost every other way

[07:04] <luminousnerd> So, last time when I sellected manually edit partition table and pressed forward, it went to the loady thingy and then froze, but not this time XD
[07:04] <euthyphro> hi. k, how can i change the time delay between periodic ext3 read/writes?
[07:04] <darkmatter> daylighter once you install kcontrol, just run from your alt+f2
[07:04] <eobanb> euthyphro, i wasnt aware there were periodic reads/writes.
[07:04] <daylighter> type "kcontrol" eh?
[07:04] <Born_In_Xixax> hi all, having strange network problem...has worked fine for weeks, now i can ping hosts by IP address or via hostname (resolving), but no other protocol will connect (http, telnet, etc.) any thoughts?
[07:04] <darkmatter> daylighter, yesh
[07:04] <daylighter> alrighty
[07:05] <darkmatter> its under desktop >behavior
[07:05] <daylighter> stupid KDE fscking up my gnome
[07:05] <luminousnerd> 2gb ram how much swap do I want

[07:05] <Born_In_Xixax> nope

[07:05] <euthyphro> eobanb, well, afaik there are.... to keep the journal
[07:06] <eobanb> sure, euthyphro, but only if you're reading/writing in the first place i think.
[07:06] <Born_In_Xixax> looking at a packet capture for a telnet attempt: there is a SYN from me to my router, a SYN/ACK back, then an immediate RST from me to the router
[07:06] <daylighter> ah yes
[07:06] <boozey> what ftp server can i use for ubuntu that i just install and it reads by linux users accounts and gives each linux user ftp access to there home folder?
[07:06] <euthyphro> but i think there might be a problem with my harddisk... my computer slows down a bit for an instant when it does the read/write and make a clicking sound
[07:06] <daylighter> that worked, thank you SO Much
[07:06] <DBO> ***Thank you all for your patience***
[07:07] <euthyphro> i did all the SMART tests and theres nothing "failing" everyting is at `100

[07:07] <Paladinew> Hello everyone, would someone be able to help me with VPN on edgy ???
[07:08] <eobanb> Paladinew, what type of VPN
[07:08] <pod> luminousnerd: yes
[07:08] <Born_In_Xixax> i've used a couple of VPN solutions with a Cisco concentrator
[07:08] <luminousnerd> Should the linux and swap be primary or extended?
[07:08] <Falcongrinder> stumped still.  Can't start mozilla or galleon in terminal to find the problem with loading
=== igor is now known as igcek
[07:08] <luminousnerd> And what filesys?
[07:08] <luminousnerd> Thanks pod
[07:08] <eobanb> it doesnt matter, luminousnerd
[07:08] <Falcongrinder> anyone advice?
[07:08] <pod> primary, Linux Swap :)
[07:08] <luminousnerd> I guess swap would be linux swap lol
[07:08] <Paladinew> I'm not sure what the diferences would be for VPN
[07:08] <luminousnerd> hehe ok thanks
[07:08] <eobanb> luminousnerd, i meant it doesnt matter about the primary/logical
[07:08] <luminousnerd> Wait so linux should be ext3 and swap should be linux swap?
[07:09] <Born_In_Xixax> you'll need to know what kind (brand) of VPN you want to connect to
[07:09] <Born_In_Xixax> unless you are setting up your own end-to-end
[07:09] <pod> yes
[07:09] <euthyphro> is there any tool i can use to show me the current status of the harddisk (i.e. reading/writing/head position/etc)
[07:09] <Paladinew> It's so I can connect back to my corporate office
[07:09] <luminousnerd> On a mac right now hehehe :)
[07:09] <Paladinew> for windows we use Cisco vpn software
[07:09] <Born_In_Xixax> ok...what's your question
[07:09] <Born_In_Xixax> ok
[07:10] <Paladinew> I followed these steps:
[07:10] <Paladinew> http://dailytechnology.net/how_to_setup_vpn_in_ubunty_edgy_eft.php
[07:10] <Paladinew> but wasn't able to really get anywhere
[07:10] <Cernunnos> cya
[07:10] <specialbuddy> is there a good walkthrough for setting up samba on ubuntu
[07:11] <Born_In_Xixax> whoa, i think that is way too much work :)
[07:11] <Born_In_Xixax> easiest i found was to install 'vpnc' from synaptic
[07:11] <Paladinew> apparently gnome network manager is installed, but I never saw the vpn tab
[07:11] <ravindran> i have nvidia card
[07:11] <Paladinew> hmm, I tried adding vpnc, didn't find it
[07:12] <Born_In_Xixax> it's command line :/
[07:12] <ravindran> but i do not know how to install the softwaer
[07:12] <Paladinew> just apt get install vpnc  ?
[07:12] <Born_In_Xixax> there is a script that it installs, something like 'pcf2???' which will convert your cisco .pcf file into the vpnc equivalent
[07:12] <Born_In_Xixax> yep: sudo apt-get install vpnc
[07:12] <Dralid> I'm setting up my HP Photosmart 2610 network printer on Edgy. Because the printer has a dynamic ip, I don't want to simply enter its current IP. Under the printer
[07:13] <Paladinew> hmm, I don't believe I have a .pcf file
[07:13] <Born_In_Xixax> get it from your windows box
[07:13] <Paladinew> done, it just installed vpnc
[07:13] <Paladinew> I have read/write ntfs, let me see if I can grab it
[07:13] <koza> hello
[07:14] <Born_In_Xixax> you may have one or several, if you have multiple locations you can vpn into
[07:14] <koza> how do i install cde?
[07:14] <koza> or x skin
[07:14] <Dralid> I'm setting up my HP Photosmart 2610 network printer on Edgy. Because the printer has a dynamic ip, I don't want to simply enter its current IP. Under the printer's settings there is a host name ("HP03308D"). How can I use that to address straight to the printer?
[07:15] <koza> how do i install CDE pls
[07:15] <bobbie__4> Any pitfalls about installing flash player 9 beta?
[07:15] <kjm> Dralid : hostname.subnet.com. . . .?  Do you have DNS on your subnet?
[07:15] <eetfunk> I forgot, how do I change user in terminal?
[07:15] <koza> how do i install CDE pls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=== BenC__ is now known as BenC
[07:15] <kjm> koza - no need to yell.
[07:15] <Paladinew> Borax, I found the pcf file. there's only one
[07:15] <koza> pls i not see any dpkg for cde
[07:15] <Born_In_Xixax> k
[07:16] <koza> kjm, pls dood
[07:16] <Born_In_Xixax> in /usr/share/vpnc
[07:16] <Born_In_Xixax> there is a script called 'pcf2vpnc'
[07:16] <kjm> koza - then it maybe one of those things you need to compile from source.
[07:16] <Paladinew> I see it
[07:16] <roycebarber> In Sunaptic should i mark my unused kernals for COMPLETE REMOVAL, or REMOVAL????
[07:16] <kjm> Is there a workaround for the "shift+backspace" crash bug in xgl?
[07:16] <Born_In_Xixax> go to that directory and do something like './pcf2vpnc /path/to/your/pcffile'
[07:17] <Paladinew> not sure I follow you on that command
[07:17] <Paladinew> want me to copy the file into that dir?
[07:18] <Born_In_Xixax> ok, copy that pcf file into the directory with that script
[07:18] <roycebarber> Does anyone know the difference between Removal and Complete Removal in Synaptic Package Manager?
[07:18] <Born_In_Xixax> then do './pcf2vpnc myfile.pcf'
[07:18] <Paladinew> how should I run that script?  I'm fairly fresh-meat
[07:18] <Born_In_Xixax> just like i typed it i think, except of course use the actual name of your .pcf file
[07:19] <Born_In_Xixax> dot slash first, since it's a script
[07:19] <Paladinew> do I need to be in that dir from the command line?
[07:19] <Born_In_Xixax> yes
[07:19] <Paladinew> k, sec
[07:20] <eobanb> roycebarber, as far as i know, removal simply uninstalls the package but keeps the files for the package on your hard drive so you can install it again later if you wish and not have to download it again.  complete removal removes the .deb entirely
[07:20] <luminousnerd> What's my best bet to get Flash 8 (NOT the plugin) to run?  Anyone heard of it?
[07:20] <Born_In_Xixax> there is actually what looks like a very neat gui vpn client called 'kvpnc' for kde
[07:20] <Born_In_Xixax> but i couldn't get it to work, sadly :/
[07:20] <Paladinew> yeah, I tried that, didn't like gnome me thinks
[07:21] <roycebarber> EOBANB im about to Complete Removal all my unused Kernel Images...should i feel safe doing that...?? it'll remove connected files, too.
[07:21] <kjm> koza - just curious, why do you need CDE?  Solaris has even dropped it.
[07:21] <Born_In_Xixax> anyway, the script should automatically generate some kind of output file, maybe 'myfile.conf'
[07:22] <Born_In_Xixax> copy that into /etc/vpnc, then you should be able to 'sudo vpnc-connect myfile.conf'
[07:22] <PMantis> Hello. I just upgraded a machine from 6.06.1 to 6.10 (Edgy)... The server won't boot now. I get the kernel loading, splash with progress bar, then blank screen with blinking cursor...
[07:22] <koza> kjm, i run slow computer
[07:22] <Paladinew> if I'm doing  "'./pcf2vpnc /path/to/your/pcffile'"
[07:22] <eetfunk> I forgot, how do I change user in terminal?
[07:22] <Paladinew> then the "path to my file, would be in the same directory if I copy it in there right?
[07:22] <Born_In_Xixax> don't get quotes in there
[07:22] <koza> kjm, i run slow computer with low mem and i wanna try cde can you pls help
[07:22] <kjm> koza - try XFCE then - it is great for legacy hardware.
[07:23] <Born_In_Xixax> start with the period: ./pcf2vpnc XXXXXX
[07:23] <Born_In_Xixax> where XXXX is the name of the pcf file you want to convert
[07:23] <Paladinew> k, trying
[07:23] <kjm> The  opengroup (which used to host CDE) doesn't seem to have it anymore.  I found a link to it through XIG, but cannot find the code or a binary - so I'm not sure.
[07:23] <omV0> help i'm on 640x480!! i just got geforce6200 but when i run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose anything higher, X gives me 'screen detected, but no usable configuration'
[07:24] <eobanb> omV0, which driver are you using?
[07:24] <Falcongrinder> i really need some advice.  I cant get any web browser to load and I have no ideas left.
[07:24] <omV0> i am using vesa i think... oh should i be using 'nv'?
[07:24] <Maurox> omV0: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[07:25] <Jewfro-Macabbi> falcongrinder, you tried from command line?
[07:25] <omV0> thanks Maurox!
[07:25] <Maurox> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[07:25] <Maurox> sudo nvidia-xconfig
[07:25] <Maurox> and reboot :)
[07:25] <omV0> Maurox: you are awesome =) i'm downloading it now..
[07:25] <Born_In_Xixax> so obvious! lol
[07:26] <luminousnerd> just booted ubuntu first time, bar isn't doing anything at all...
[07:26] <luminousnerd> is it extremely slow?
[07:26] <Falcongrinder> jewfro i cant figure anything from that because it doesnt show errors.  It just quits
[07:26] <kjm> luminousned- would depend.  Booting from the CD?  How much RAM do you have?
[07:26] <Paladinew> Born, I got this "/media/windows/Program Files/Cisco Systems/VPN Client/Profiles/VPN.starkinvestments.com.pcf
[07:26] <Paladinew> "
[07:26] <omV0> Maurox: after i install it, trying to enable it gives me "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel."
[07:26] <Paladinew> wrong message, sec
[07:26] <Paladinew> To decrypt the group password, it will be sent to the website
[07:26] <Paladinew> 'http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode'. If
[07:26] <Paladinew> you are absolutely sure that you want to do this, enter 'yes',
[07:26] <Paladinew> otherwise just enter anything else.
[07:26] <luminousnerd> kjm, no, just finished installing, booting own computer, 2GB ram
[07:26] <bradley> i use nvidia twinview and i want to set up each desktop with a different background. how do i do it?
[07:26] <matthew_w> After upgrading to Edgy, Ubuntu has SERIOUS problems with udev, and will completely not start.
[07:27] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Falcongrinder, that's an odd one...
[07:27] <Born_In_Xixax> wheee...
[07:27] <Paladinew> is that good?
[07:27] <Maurox> nvidia-glx installed the linux-headers ???
[07:27] <luminousnerd> kjm the bar just moved a tiny bit
[07:27] <Born_In_Xixax> AFAIK this won't hurt anything, but that's a scary message...might want to backup the file
[07:27] <luminousnerd> lol ok there it goes
[07:27] <kjm> hum - shouldn't take to long..........check in the boot.log to see if it is freezing on anything.....
[07:27] <Paladinew> lol
[07:27] <Paladinew> yea
[07:27] <Falcongrinder> after i installed macromedia flash 7 it stopped opening. even after reinstalling.
[07:27] <Maurox> omV0: just rebooting and you will have no problem
[07:27] <omV0> Maurox: it just said "unpacking" and then "setting up nvidia-glx".. it didn't say what it was doinge exactly
[07:28] <Paladinew> ok, so it did its thing, now what ?
[07:28] <PMantis> upstart killed my box... help?
[07:28] <kjm> luminousnerd - for example - if the network isn't set up correctly, it could sit there for a while waiting for localhost to time out etc.
[07:28] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Falcongrinder, oh, uninstall flash
[07:28] <UTENTE> hello
[07:28] <kjm> UTENTE: Hello
[07:28] <omV0> Maurox: ok about to reboot and i'll be back to let you know! thanks a lot =)
[07:28] <UTENTE> why di u choose ubuntu and not kubuntu just curius?
[07:28] <Maurox> oka
[07:28] <luminousnerd> wow
[07:28] <luminousnerd> this is really, really nice...
[07:29] <luminousnerd> Been a long time since I dabbled in Linux, but as far as Ubuntu it's come a long way.
[07:29] <luminousnerd> Well...not really a long time lol..like 5 months XD
[07:29] <Born_In_Xixax> lol
[07:29] <luminousnerd> Eh..my scroll lock won't turn on
[07:29] <luminousnerd> ...wtf
[07:30] <Born_In_Xixax> doh
[07:30] <Born_In_Xixax> who uses a scroll lock though ;)
[07:30] <Paladinew> Born, do I fire up vpnc next or what ?
[07:30] <Madpilot> luminousnerd, does ScrollLock actually *do* anything on a modern system?
[07:30] <siimo> hi is there a good BIT torrent client for ubuntu
[07:30] <kjm> luminousnerd : just wait until you start playing with XGL and beryl.
[07:30] <Born_In_Xixax> did the script produce an output file in that directory?
[07:30] <kjm> siimo - azereus is good
[07:30] <luminousnerd> Born_In_Xixax, I do!!!
[07:30] <luminousnerd> I need scroll lock!
[07:30] <Born_In_Xixax> k, copy it to /et/vpnc
[07:31] <Born_In_Xixax> er, /etc/vpnc
[07:31] <luminousnerd> It controls my Keyboard's LEDs!! :(
[07:31] <Paladinew> negative
[07:31] <Paladinew> you sure it was supposed to give that weird message?
[07:31] <Born_In_Xixax> let me run through it again myself
[07:32] <daylighter> I wish I could figure out how to upgrade to beryl 0.1.2
[07:33] <omV0> Maurox: that worked =) made my resolution 1024x768.. but for some reason it won't let me go higher than that..
[07:33] <kjm> daylighter - is there a fix/workaround for the backspace+shift crashing/
[07:33] <luminousnerd> Alright, can I get some help here?  My Internet doesn't seem to be working properly.  I can pull up some pages, but others that work fine here on my Mac don't work at all in Ubuntu
[07:33] <AsheD> anybody know what progam would be 'Launching HTTP Cache Cleaner' ?
[07:33] <omV0> Maurox: should i manually edit the xorg.conf file?
[07:34] <Maurox> daylighter: add this to source.list deb http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org edgy beryl-svn
[07:34] <Maurox> deb-src http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org edgy beryl-svn
[07:34] <Jewfro-Macabbi> in the chmod command, for example chmod 777, which number is owner,group.others?
[07:34] <UTENTE> best film on linux 58 min here is the best film on linux for me 58 min enjoy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFHLIRSJv6w
[07:34] <Born_In_Xixax> bah, network isn't working in ubuntu
[07:34] <luminousnerd> Namely, gnome-look.org
[07:34] <Maurox> omV0: you can add you resolution to xorg.conf
[07:35] <Paladinew> hmm
[07:35] <Falcongrinder> im so frustrated
[07:35] <specialbuddy> why is samba hard to set up on ubuntu but easy on Gentoo?
[07:35] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Falcongrinder, I remember someone here had the same problem, worked fine after he uninstalled flash7
[07:36] <Falcongrinder> i uninstalled that as well as firefox
[07:36] <Paladinew> any other ideas?
[07:36] <luminousnerd> :(
[07:37] <Born_In_Xixax> in the directory /etc/vpnc, you should find something like 'vpnc.conf'
[07:37] <Falcongrinder> then reinstalled it: nothing.  Installed galeon: still nothing..
[07:37] <Born_In_Xixax> of 'default.conf'
=== Nikolas_ is now known as Nikolas
[07:37] <Born_In_Xixax> you can edit that file (or copy it and edit the copy) and enter the info manually
[07:37] <Daylighter> as I was saying
[07:37] <Born_In_Xixax> i.e. open your .pcf file
[07:37] <luminousnerd> Does Ubuntu not open RAR by default?
[07:38] <Born_In_Xixax> luminousnerd: no, it's proprietary
[07:38] <Maurox> yes but i dont remember the repositories :P
[07:38] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, you need a package, it's unrar-free, or something like that, do aptitude search unrar
[07:39] <luminousnerd> Born_In_Xixax sorry I don't know what that means, but can I get it to unrar stuff?
[07:39] <luminousnerd> Oh
[07:39] <luminousnerd> Okay
[07:39] <Paladinew> Born, in /etc/vpnc/ I have example.conf and a vpn-script folder
[07:39] <luminousnerd> Isn't there a gui for it? jw I don't mind terminal
[07:39] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Falcongrinder, try removing the firefox settings from your home folder?
[07:40] <UTENTE> im curius of a question why u use ubuntu and not kubuntu personal taste for gnome?
[07:40] <Falcongrinder> that was included in the complete removal
[07:40] <Born_In_Xixax> ok, edit example.conf and replace the info with the relevant info from your .pcf file
[07:40] <Paladinew> ok, 1 sec
[07:40] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Falcongrinder, well, you'll need a nerd higher than I......
[07:41] <Falcongrinder> thanks for your help
[07:41] <luminousnerd> umm, aptitude search rar returns nothing (as does unrar)
[07:41] <Born_In_Xixax> for the 'IPSec secret' field, you will need to copy the extremely long encoded secret in your .pcf, at this website: http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode
[07:41] <Maurox> unrar-free
[07:41] <Jewfro-Macabbi> lminousnerd, did you enable all repositories?
[07:41] <Born_In_Xixax> * and decode it at that website
[07:42] <Paladinew> hmm, there dosen't appear to be a IPSec secret field
[07:42] <Borat> guys, ubuntu is raping my battery life, does anyone know to help it? im running at 1/3 of my cpu speed, and im getting like 19 minutes of batt on 51 %, when in windows i get 5 times the amount..
[07:42] <Born_In_Xixax> in the .pcf file?
[07:42] <luminousnerd> Maurox, how? where?
[07:43] <Paladinew> yea, not there
[07:43] <luminousnerd> Jewfro-Macabbi, no idea...was never presented with such an option
[07:43] <Maurox> with universe repositories activated
[07:43] <Maurox> and i guess multiverse too
[07:43] <Paladinew> I can show you whats there
[07:43] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, you'll need to do that, go to system, administration, software properties, then check all the boxes....
[07:43] <Born_In_Xixax> it's called enc_GroupPwd
[07:43] <Paladinew> ah, yes, that field I do have
[07:43] <Born_In_Xixax> no, don't post your super secret confidential data in here :)
[07:44] <luminousnerd> Okay thanks Jewfro-Macabbi
[07:44] <Beached> Hi, I am trying to configure knetworkmanager, but it doesn't seem to remember the password.  I have kwalletmanager started, but it won't restart when I log back on and does not show any passwords for knetworkmanager
[07:44] <Paladinew> it's already filled in with some really long set of numbers
[07:44] <Beached> any ideas?
=== eggzeck_ is now known as eggzeck[laptop] 
[07:44] <Born_In_Xixax> you are copying info from the .pcf file, into the .conf file right?
[07:44] <Paladinew> correct
[07:44] <Born_In_Xixax> k
[07:44] <Born_In_Xixax> copy this long string of stuff, go to this website: http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode
[07:44] <Born_In_Xixax> and decode it
[07:45] <Paladinew> ok
[07:45] <Born_In_Xixax> copy whatever it spits out, and paste into the .conf file
[07:45] <Born_In_Xixax> for the 'IPSec secret' field
[07:45] <Paladinew> k, sec
[07:45] <H3g3m0n> Is the automatix site down or just me?
[07:45] <koza> can someone here advise me
[07:45] <nothlit> H3g3m0n, why use automatix
[07:45] <koza> nvm
[07:46] <Paladinew> Born, do I want to enter the clear text pw in that field? or the number string?
[07:46] <Born_In_Xixax> it's down for me too koza
[07:46] <luminousnerd> unrar still does not show up when in add/remove programs, shouldn't it show up there?  It does show up when using aptitude search.  I'm not sure how to install it using aptitude
[07:46] <luminousnerd> But I'd prefer to be able to do by gui if that's possible
[07:46] <Born_In_Xixax> the .conf needs to have the clear text password
[07:46] <Paladinew> oh, I knew what that pw was already ;-)
[07:46] <nothlit> H3g3m0n, i just checked the site and its down
[07:46] <Born_In_Xixax> luminous: just use the regular archive manager
[07:47] <H3g3m0n> nothlit, To enable things like win32codecs, truetype, nvidia drivers etc
[07:47] <H3g3m0n> hmm dang :/
[07:47] <Paladinew> ok, so its entered
[07:47] <Born_In_Xixax> alright, save the changes, if all is well you can do 'sudo vpnc-connect example.conf'
[07:47] <nothlit> H3g3m0n, you can do it without automatix, its not difficult
[07:47] <Paladinew> lets see
[07:47] <luminousnerd> Born_In_Xixax umm..it doesn't work on rar
[07:48] <Born_In_Xixax> :/
[07:48] <Borat> guys, ubuntu is raping my battery life, does anyone know to help it? im running at 1/3 of my cpu speed, and im getting like 19 minutes of batt on 51 %, when in windows i get 5 times the amount..
[07:48] <nothlit> luminousnerd, you need to install rar unrar or unrar-free
[07:48] <Born_In_Xixax> probably command line drive then
[07:48] <Born_In_Xixax> try 'unrar --help' from the CLI
[07:48] <nothlit> Borat, make sure cpu scaling is working
[07:49] <Paladinew> Born, holy crap, I think it worked  "VPNC started in background"

[07:49] <luminousnerd> nothlit I Know that's the mess I'm in!
[07:49] <Paladinew> ok, now to see if I can actually connect
[07:49] <Maurox> damn, beryl still loses close bottom sometimes
[07:49] <Born_In_Xixax> linux, it's like banging your head against a brick wall...it's so good when you stop
[07:49] <luminousnerd> Yea, definitely a FAR cry from windows' usability still :(
[07:50] <Borat> im using emi freq .18
[07:50] <Borat> do you know a better one nothlit?
[07:50] <luminousnerd> I just did sudo aptitude install unrar-free and it supposedly worked but I still can't unrar graphically
[07:50] <luminousnerd> I want to be able to do it graphically, I know it's possible by terminal but...
[07:51] <Maurox> :o new beryl update again 1!
[07:51] <Borat> nothlit, there was a program in windows called notebook hardware controll that allowed me to lower my voltages.
[07:51] <nothlit> Borat, lol i don't have installed on ubuntu on my laptop, but you should go see if anything is using a lot of cpu, and you can disable nonvital services
[07:51] <itclanster> command sudo is not working its saying setuid root
[07:51] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, graphically did you try right clicking the file, extract here?
[07:51] <luminousnerd> Jewfro-Macabbi yes I did
[07:51] <luminousnerd> "Archive type not supported
[07:52] <itclanster> i had changed the permisions 755 for /usr/bin
[07:52] <nothlit> luminousnerd, i just installed the rar package, it works fine with Ark , it should be in multiverse
[07:52] <luminousnerd> nothlit I don't understand what you mean
[07:52] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, yeah, it worked for me also, I have Ark also: sudo aptitude install ark
[07:52] <Paladinew> hey Born: any idea how to test this and see if I'm actually connected to my work network?
[07:52] <luminousnerd> I'm a slack user all this universe and package stuff is new (besides that, been a while since I was into slack even)

[07:52] <glick> you all know that right
[07:52] <glick> ?
[07:53] <luminousnerd> alright I'll get ark then
[07:53] <nothlit> luminousnerd, theres three different package, unrar, unrar-free and rar. i'm saying the package rar works fine for me, but its in the multiverse repository
[07:53] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, once you get used to it, it's quite nice

[07:53] <Born_In_Xixax> well, go to an work only internal webpage?
[07:53] <Born_In_Xixax> or do whatever you would do if you were in the office?
[07:53] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, look under applications, accessories, you may already have ark
[07:54] <luminousnerd> This version of Ubuntu is very good with hardware.  I've never had Linux recognize every damn peice of hardware before.
[07:54] <luminousnerd> Jewfro-Macabbi` I didn't but I just got it
[07:54] <Paladinew> lol, good call
[07:54] <luminousnerd> tons of dependencies
[07:54] <Born_In_Xixax> is Ark a KDE app?
[07:54] <luminousnerd> nice that it gets them all for you though, very big time saver right there
[07:54] <Paladinew> grrr, cant seem to pull up our intranet page
[07:54] <Paladinew> which would make me think its not connected properly huh...
[07:54] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, exactly...
[07:54] <luminousnerd> kde apps will still work in gnome though won't they? most would when I was into slack
[07:55] <Born_In_Xixax> yes, though they will isntall a ton of dependencies :)
[07:55] <luminousnerd> Crap
[07:55] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, yes, it install dependencies, as you see, for you
[07:55] <Born_In_Xixax> but, nicely all handled for you
[07:55] <luminousnerd> "The utility unrar is not in your PATH"
[07:55] <itclanster> i need help : command sudo is not working its saying "setuid root"  it happened after i changed the permisions chmod 755  /usr/bin/ , so how can access root privilages commands now
[07:55] <luminousnerd> if Only I could remember what that meant lol..but shouldn't it be there automatically?
[07:55] <nothlit> well mostly its just qt and kdelibs, it all depends on which/how many kde packages you install

[07:56] <sohum> hi, i'm a linux newbie
[07:57] <nothlit> add the universe and multiverse repository and then sudo aptitude purge unrar-free rar+
[07:57] <luminousnerd> If I did aptitude install unrar-free, shouldn't it have gone to path?
[07:57] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, I'm looking now for an answer, googling......
[07:57] <Paladinew> Born, any other ideas man?
[07:57] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, or try nothlit's suggestion
[07:58] <luminousnerd> Okay
[07:58] <luminousnerd> Thanks for the help btw
[07:58] <Jewfro-Macabbi> luminousnerd, echo PATH=$PATH:/path/to/unrar
[07:58] <sohum> fwiw, sudo aptitude install unrar worked for me
[07:58] <Paladinew> how do I close the vpnc connection that it thinks is already open?
[07:59] <boozey> what ftp server can i use for ubuntu that i just install and it reads by linux users accounts and gives each linux user ftp access to there home folder?
[07:59] <luminousnerd> Worked thanks a ton!!! :)
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> vpnc-disconnect, i think
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> well i'll be damned
[07:59] <foo> Will gnucash be in ubuntu 6.06 at all?
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> i connected to work, and my network is working fine via vpn
[07:59] <Born_In_Xixax> hmmm
[07:59] <Maurox> oops beryl is broken :P
[07:59] <Paladinew> When I type" sudo vpnc-connect example.conf"
[07:59] <luminousnerd> Now, any idea why Gnome-Look.org won't work in Ubuntu?  It says the page isn't redirecting properly
[07:59] <sohum> how do i get around an xargs: argument line too long
[08:00] <nothlit> that shouldn't be an issue with ubuntu
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as tasya
[08:00] <Paladinew> then I et prompted to enter the IPSec gateway address, the ID, the secrect, and username, and pw
[08:00] <nothlit> luminousnerd, go see if w3m can access the site
[08:01] <Born_In_Xixax> ok, so the file 'example.conf' doesn't have the information in it you need
[08:01] <Born_In_Xixax> i.e. the stuff from your .pcf file
[08:01] <Paladinew> guess not...
[08:01] <euthyphro> anyone having problems hibernating after updates?
[08:01] <Paladinew> let me open it back up and take a look
[08:01] <luminousnerd> w3m eh? *googles*
[08:01] <Born_In_Xixax> it should work anyway since it's prompting you for the info?
[08:01] <sohum> argument line being
[08:01] <sohum> cd /media/sda6/Pictures; find -iname \*jpg\* | grep -v Wallpaper | grep -v Picasa | grep -v -Z iPod | xargs --null jhead
[08:01] <Paladinew> I would think
[08:02] <Born_In_Xixax> make sure you are not mixing up the group password or 'secret' with your personal password
[08:02] <sohum> ai know it's not exactly an ubuntu problem, but i couldn't think of where else to ask
=== boozey is now known as boodzut
[08:02] <luminousnerd> Nope, nothlit won't open in w3m, says redirection loop detected then goes to MOVED PERMANENTLY
[08:02] <luminousnerd> but it works on this mac
[08:03] <Paladinew> Born, I'll pm you with what's in the .pcf file, minus sensitive info

[08:06] <Born_In_Xixax> from the list over there -------> double click my name

[08:08] <itclanster> sudo command is not working for me after i changed permissions to /usr/bin/ to 777 ....now i m not able to get root privilages on my system..is it possible to get root privilages without using sudo
[08:09] <SilentDis> itclanster:  did you enable the root account (I.E. give it a password)?
[08:09] <Jewfro-Macabbi> how do I change permissions for a group user?
[08:10] <Paladinew> were you able to see that Born?
[08:10] <itclanster> no i use sudo to access root
[08:10] <itclanster> i have not enabled root as a login name
[08:10] <luminousnerd> How can I just install a font?
[08:11] <nothlit> luminousnerd, don't add the www
[08:11] <Born_In_Xixax> ya
[08:11] <SilentDis> itclanster: if sudo is dead, the only fix I can think of is to boot from the LiveCD again, mount your drive, and then change the permissions back

[08:12] <Borat> what is the sudo apt-get command for fglrx drivers?
[08:12] <luminousnerd> nothlit eh...www where?
[08:12] <Borat> please quick
[08:12] <Born_In_Xixax> so that is your .pcf file, what is in your example.conf file
[08:12] <itclanster> but then it will be changed only for the new running os
[08:12] <itclanster> not for my os
[08:12] <luminousnerd> Oooh I got ya nothlit that worked!
[08:12] <nothlit> luminousnerd, just place it in ~/.fonts
[08:12] <luminousnerd> Thanks!
[08:12] <luminousnerd> ok great
[08:13] <Paladinew> that is the .pcf file, but it's identical to what I copied into the .conf file
[08:13] <luminousnerd> thanks yet again!
[08:13] <nothlit> luminousnerd, never add a www. unless you need to, its the devils spawn when getting to websites
[08:13] <Born_In_Xixax> no no on, you need to retain the format of the original, conf file
[08:13] <SilentDis> Borat: sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[08:13] <Born_In_Xixax> but copy the relevant info from the .pcf
[08:13] <Paladinew> lol, oh crap
[08:13] <itclanster> luminousnerd: ??
[08:13] <Borat> SilentDis, thanks
[08:13] <Paladinew> I simply over wrote it
[08:13] <SilentDis> Borat: no troubles :)
[08:13] <Paladinew> Ooops
[08:14] <Paladinew> hmmm, you wouldn't happen to have a example.conf I could use ?
[08:14] <luminousnerd> I don't get it nothlit...it works fine with WWW in firefox on Mac
[08:15] <luminousnerd> Why I was just following a link first, why do I need to take out www?
[08:15] <Born_In_Xixax> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31607/
[08:15] <Paladinew> it's just those 4 lines?
[08:15] <Born_In_Xixax> yep
[08:16] <Paladinew> hmm
[08:16] <Paladinew> ok, lets try that
[08:16] <Born_In_Xixax> so copy 'VPN.s*****.com' in where it now says 'ip.address.dot.com'
[08:16] <nothlit> luminousnerd, i dunno, different name resolution mechanism?
[08:16] <Born_In_Xixax> and so on
[08:16] <nothlit> luminousnerd, did you try it recently?
[08:16] <shawn__> what is the package that is a browse/install interface to art.gnome,org
[08:16] <nothlit> luminousnerd, it could just be safari auto tries without www. if it doesn't work
[08:17] <luminousnerd> nothlit, no...firefox
[08:17] <luminousnerd> Lol I wouldn't use safari :/
[08:17] <nothlit> luminousnerd, lol dunno then
[08:17] <luminousnerd> A lot better than IE but...lot to be desired >.<
[08:17] <ademan> anyone here use eclipse?
[08:18] <slavik> ademan: shoot
[08:18] <durrie> Anyone know how to get a NetoDragon 56k modem to work on Ubuntu
[08:19] <SilentDis> durrie:  i think those are based on the lucent chipset
[08:19] <SilentDis> !winmodem
[08:19] <ubotu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[08:19] <Overand> What's the syntax for grep to search for "one string" OR "another string" (returning all occurences of both)?
[08:19] <durrie> I thought they were SmartLink?
[08:19] <luminousnerd> What type of file does Theme Preferences want?  I just got one called T-Ish and the guide is extremely vague
[08:19] <ademan> slavik: in the cdt how do you add an include path?
[08:19] <SilentDis> durrie:  either way, that guide is your best bet :)
[08:20] <durrie> ok another dialup question
[08:20] <shawn__> anyone? what is the package that is a browse/install interface to art.gnome.org?
[08:20] <durrie> say I get the modem to work..what about running a dialup program that is made for windows? I have Netscape Internet Service which has a Web Accelerator
[08:20] <SilentDis> shawn__: sudo apt-get install gnome-art
[08:20] <slavik> ademan: the only language I use eclipse for is Java, I suggest looking to other IDEs for C/C++
[08:21] <slavik> consider Kdevelop and Anjuta
[08:21] <SilentDis> durrie: web accelerators just plain don't work under linux.  at least, none that i've found.
[08:21] <durrie> well it's a program tho, the dialer is
[08:21] <Flannel> ademan: you go to your properties, and do it that way
[08:21] <Flannel> ademan: project properties, or whatnot.
[08:21] <Paladinew> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31608/
[08:21] <SilentDis> durrie:  most of the time, you can just use the built-in ppp stuff in linux to make the connection.  you won't get the acceleration stuff, but it'll work.
[08:22] <SilentDis> !dialup | durrie
[08:22] <ubotu> durrie: You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[08:22] <Paladinew> that's what I get when I try to connect
[08:22] <Born_In_Xixax> can you paste your 'example.conf' file
[08:22] <slavik> dial-up accelarator = caching pages ... or using compression ... or snake oil
[08:22] <shawn__> SilentDis THANKS!!!
[08:22] <ademan> thanks Flannel
[08:22] <Paladinew> sure
[08:22] <SilentDis> shawn__: nt :)
[08:23] <durrie> slavik: I know that but the problem is I only connect at 11.6 so anything helps.
[08:23] <Born_In_Xixax> jesus, ouch 11.6
[08:23] <durrie> yeah I know.
[08:23] <slavik> durrie: isdsl/cable avail in your area?
[08:23] <Born_In_Xixax> you must have the patience of a zen monk
[08:23] <durrie> Nope, not even ISDN
[08:23] <SilentDis> slavik:  most of them act as a proxy at the ISPs side, they recompress text, then resample images down as well.  then, they pass it to the proxy client on the user's machine, and it decompresses it, and passes it back to the web browser as a proxy server.

[08:24] <SilentDis> durrie: i'm in much the same boat.  i live in the boonies, and i THOUGHT dialup was my only answer...
[08:24] <Born_In_Xixax> well, i think you have '1. 2.' etc. in there
[08:24] <Born_In_Xixax> the numbers/spaces at the beginning of each line shouldn't be there
[08:24] <durrie> SilentDis: Well it is my only one. No one offers cable, dsl or ISDN here, nor satellite due to tree coverage
[08:25] <rickyfingers__> SilenDis durrie: I was in the ultimate boonies, Iraq, and we had sattelite out there
[08:25] <SilentDis> durrie:  but... there are wireless carriers that use non LOS service now.  most have 15 mile radius.  i'm looking into it now myself
[08:25] <glick> bummer durrie
[08:25] <durrie> SilentDis: Also..it seems in order to dial into netscape i HAVE to use the program otherwise it will not authenticate
[08:25] <Paladinew> ok, I'll remove those quick
[08:25] <rickyfingers__> expensive...but do-able if you split it up between a few people
[08:25] <durrie> SilentDis: Only wireless provider is 5 miles and they have a 3 quare mile range which I'm out of
[08:25] <rickyfingers__> I'd be surprised if the entire U.S. didn't have sat coverage.
[08:25] <durrie> I also tried a booster antenna and no luck
[08:26] <glick> is feisty fawn gonna include non free software by default?
[08:26] <SilentDis> durrie: you're using netscape's dialup service?  they just use username/password.  nothing special
[08:26] <glick> and enable 3d desktop by default?
[08:26] <Paladinew> "vpnc-connect: binding to port 500: Address already in use"
[08:26] <Paladinew> but it looks better, how do I close that port?
[08:26] <durrie> SilentDis: Well it won't authenticate without the program though. I have tried everything
[08:26] <umops> Paladinew, kill whatever is using that port
[08:26] <Born_In_Xixax> do you need to disconnect first?
[08:27] <SilentDis> durrie:  give this page a check.  choose your state from the dropdown.  you'd be surprized by what's actually out there - http://www.onelasvegas.com/wireless/
[08:27] <Born_In_Xixax> durrie: or dslreports.com
[08:27] <Paladinew> "vpnc-disconnect"
[08:27] <Paladinew> no vpnc found running
[08:27] <SilentDis> durrie:  i no longer use their service, found a much better local carrier.  *shrug*
[08:27] <Born_In_Xixax> innaresting, well maybe some other kind of software is using that port
[08:27] <durrie> DSLreports shows a cable provider here but they do not provide for my city actually.
[08:28] <SilentDis> durrie: I'm in VERY much the same boat lol
[08:28] <Born_In_Xixax> you can reboot i guess, or find someone here who can help you find out what app is using 500
[08:28] <durrie> Well what attracted me to netscape was the price and the accelerator.
[08:28] <Paladinew> should I just log off/on quick?
[08:28] <SilentDis> durrie:  satellite is available to me... but the 3000ms ping times scare me :P
[08:28] <umops> sudo killall vpnc
[08:28] <Born_In_Xixax> SilentDis, is the upstream still via modem?
[08:28] <Paladinew> I'll give that a try, are you taking off now Born ?
[08:28] <durrie> Yeah the latency is horrible, but I live in the mountains and 100+ foot pine strees are small around here, so ya know lol
[08:29] <durrie> You can get a two way satellite, but it's very expensive
[08:29] <durrie> trees^
[08:29] <Born_In_Xixax> well, your stuck then...there's definitely nothing else to do in W VA
[08:29] <Paladinew> ok, brb
[08:29] <ademan> with gcc if i have /usr/include as an include path, and in my code i #include <foo/bar.h>   will it check /usr/include/foo/bar.h?
[08:29] <SilentDis> Born_In_xixas: not anymore.  you have both options.  if you use modem upstream, it's around 1500ms pings.  if you use the satellite up/down, it's around 3000ms.
[08:29] <Born_In_Xixax> lol
[08:29] <rickyfingers__> Yeah, the initial latency does stink
[08:30] <durrie> I think last time I looked into 2-way satellite it was like something around $700 for the dish and about $80 a month for low end DSL speeds
[08:30] <rickyfingers__> But I had some buddies who did manage to get to level 60 in wow
[08:30] <durrie> no static IP either
[08:30] <SilentDis> for browsing and downloading, satellite works.  for anything real-time (games, as example), it ain't gonna happen ;)
[08:30] <rickyfingers__> starting characters after we started using satellite.
[08:30] <Born_In_Xixax> last three houses i bought, distance to the CO was literally the 2nd consideration, after the price
[08:30] <SilentDis> durrie:  yes, up-front costs on satellite 'net access is VERY expensive
[08:31] <Cheetah> hey folks
[08:31] <durrie> At the moment i'm actually looking into getting a petition going for the local cable company for my town since they provide the town before mine & the town after mine, just not mine.
[08:31] <Paladinew> hey Born, what was that command to connect to vpnc again?
[08:31] <Paladinew> I forgot to write it down
[08:31] <Born_In_Xixax> hopefully there are folks in the community that can help you easily with your modem, but from what i gather reading online, overall winmodem support for linux is very poor
=== eno is now known as eno-zzz
=== nothlit_ is now known as nothlit
[08:32] <Born_In_Xixax> vpnc-connect example.conf
[08:32] <slavik> durrie: you should send a letter to their competitors
[08:32] <durrie> Well I think I have some hope for mine though. Netodragon when their website was up actually had a *nix driver for download
[08:32] <durrie> but their website is down now.
[08:32] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax: I agree.  that's why i recommend external serial modems to everyone who needs such a thing.  $60 and they're available at compusa still :)
[08:32] <Paladinew> thanks
[08:32] <Paladinew> brb
[08:33] <Born_In_Xixax> yes, an external modem - i understand - 'just works'
[08:33] <Born_In_Xixax> and are sometimes found dirt cheap at 2nd hand shops etc
[08:33] <Crankymonky> Is there anyway to change where GRUB looks for the files in /boot/grub without reinstalling it?  When I tried to reinstall GRUB from the alternate install disk, failed installing to the drive I wanted it to hda1(my dapper /root)  but it worked reinstalling to hda2(my edgy /root)
[08:33] <Born_In_Xixax> you still won't get the special Netscape acceleration features though
[08:33] <durrie> really the only thing that I am worried about is finding or getting this web accelerator to work on nix
[08:33] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax: or, if you demand THE BEST, as I do, you hit eBay and buy used Courior V.everything modems rofl
[08:34] <SilentDis> durrie:  the web accellerator is just not gonna happen, sorry to say.
[08:34] <durrie> I did however hack it up enough to make it work properly in firefox on windows lol
[08:35] <SilentDis> durrie:  the client app won't run, period.  they don't make anything that'll run under *nix.  none of them do.  those things are geared toward the low-end user, and the low-end user runs windows.  :P
[08:35] <durrie> well this low end user is trying to upgrade to nix but it's becoming a bit of a hassle
[08:36] <Jewfro-Macabbi> I thought web accelerators were just graphics compression?
[08:36] <durrie> I've been using nix for years and years on vservers and dedicated just never for personal use
[08:36] <SilentDis> durrie:  i recently (well, 2 months ago) switched to ubuntu, and haven't looked back.  sans accellerator and all :)
[08:36] <durrie> Jewfro-Macabbi: The netscape one is, yes
[08:36] <Crankymonky> Is there anyway to change where GRUB looks for the files in /boot/grub without reinstalling it?  When I tried to reinstall GRUB from the alternate install disk, failed installing to the drive I wanted it to hda1(my dapper /root)  but it worked reinstalling to hda2(my edgy /root)
[08:37] <Born_In_Xixax> can you describe more exactly the architecture of the accelerator app?
[08:37] <durrie> Well I guess I just need to save that webpage on the modems to my nix drive, boot to ubuntu and give it a try
[08:37] <Born_In_Xixax> is this something that could work under wine?  I can't even begin to believe it might, but
[08:37] <phpnuborn> who here runs ubuntu and apache in vmplayer and can surf to it from outside the vmplayer?
[08:37] <hockyhair> can someone tell me the name of the app that shows you what folders have what amount of space in them via a pie chart
[08:37] <durrie> wish I could it bascially connects to a remote netscape server on port 0 and compress' every image type except excuteables (png..bmp..)
[08:37] <Born_In_Xixax> phpnuborn, i've done such things
[08:37] <umops> How do you add a program/command to execute on boot?
[08:38] <Jewfro-Macabbi> anyone tell me how to change a group users permissions, I'm was setting up fuse-tools for ntfs writes, I keep getting permission errors, but the standard chmod doesn't work here...
[08:38] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax:  client runs on user computer.  it acts as a proxy server running on localmachine.  browser makes request to the little accl client.  accel client compresses the request, and sends that to the accel server at the ISP.  ISP box goes out, fetches the page, recompresses it, recompresses the graphics, then sends it back to the client.  client uncompresses everything, and passes it back to the browser.
[08:38] <umops> Jewfro-Macabbi, user 'chown'
[08:39] <Born_In_Xixax> hmm
[08:39] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax:  no, won't run in wine.  I've tried lol
[08:39] <durrie> SilentDis: in a nut shell lol
[08:39] <Born_In_Xixax> so how do you configure IE when you hook it up
[08:39] <Jewfro-Macabbi> umpos, more detail on the syntax please?
[08:39] <cliffd> anyone been able to install 6.10 on a dmraid devices?
[08:39] <nothlit> Crankymonky, sudo grub             root(hd#,#)             setup(hd#)     <-- where MBR goes
[08:39] <Born_In_Xixax> ah ok...well NM then :)
[08:39] <umops> Jewfro-Macabbi, sudo chown nobody:nogroup
[08:39] <durrie> Born_In_Xixax: it configures IE itself
[08:39] <Paladinew> phoenix@ubuntu:~$ sudo vpnc-connect example.conf
[08:39] <Paladinew> Password:
[08:39] <Paladinew> Sorry, try again.
[08:39] <Paladinew> Password:
[08:39] <Paladinew> Sorry, try again.
[08:39] <Paladinew> Password:
[08:39] <durrie> changes the port IE looks on to 5400
[08:39] <Paladinew> Sorry, try again.
[08:39] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax:  the client usually enters the registry and makes the changes for the user.  basically, it sets http proxy to localhost:5400 or something.
[08:39] <Paladinew> sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts
[08:39] <Paladinew> that's what I got =/
[08:39] <Born_In_Xixax> k
[08:39] <Born_In_Xixax> well
[08:40] <Born_In_Xixax> if it's just using local network services
[08:40] <Paladinew> this is way more difficult than it should be
[08:40] <hockyhair> cmon someone has to know the name of this app
[08:40] <Madpilot> Paladinew, mind the pasting, please
[08:40] <Born_In_Xixax> it's theoretically more likely to work under wine that other possibilities i guess
[08:40] <hockyhair> i have it already somewhere, but i forget the name :(
[08:40] <t4bLeT> hi all
[08:40] <slavik> hockyhair: baobab?
[08:40] <Born_In_Xixax> paladin, do you use Softtoken?
[08:41] <Paladinew> no
[08:41] <Born_In_Xixax> when you login via windows
[08:41] <durrie> http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/
[08:41] <Born_In_Xixax> or a token card?
[08:41] <Paladinew> nope
[08:41] <Paladinew> just username /pw
[08:41] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax:  the only way I can see getting it to work is to setup a VM of some sort, have it running in the background.  on said VM, run a proxy server, as well as the accellerator (the accelerator won't accept outside proxy requests).  then, route your real computer to the VM proxy, and the VM proxy routes it through the accel.
[08:41] <phpnuborn> Born_In_Xixax, i private you?
[08:41] <Born_In_Xixax> lol
[08:42] <durrie> sounds like a pain to me
[08:42] <durrie> more work than needed
[08:42] <Born_In_Xixax> php, you did and i answered..?
[08:42] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax:  like I said, not even viable :P
[08:42] <Paladinew> I do get this message though "GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:
[08:42] <Paladinew> Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
[08:42] <Paladinew> "
[08:42] <Born_In_Xixax> i guess you could create a VM and run IE inside it for your browsing needs
[08:42] <Born_In_Xixax> for comedy option
[08:42] <roughtrader> is there a graphical way to edit fstab?
[08:42] <SilentDis> !paste | paladinew
[08:42] <ubotu> paladinew: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:43] <roughtrader> I just added a new drive to my system and would like to have it mounted automatically at startup
[08:43] <SilentDis> roughtrader:  sure, gksu gedit /etc/fstab.  or, did you mean an INTERACTIVE way?
[08:43] <Jewfro-Macabbi> roughtrader, add it to the pmount.allow file
=== james is now known as Daylighter
[08:43] <Born_In_Xixax> Paladin, that is a pretty standard message I've seen...i don't think it's relevant here
[08:43] <Daylighter> Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[08:43] <Paladinew> k
[08:43] <Jewfro-Macabbi> roughtrader, sudo gedit /etc/pmount.allow, add for example, dev/hda1

[08:44] <koza> i couldnt install cde. can some please help me install open motif
[08:44] <Born_In_Xixax> paladin, i've exhausted my knowledge, and have to sleep
[08:44] <koza> i really wanna learn old school
[08:44] <koza> please
[08:44] <roughtrader> I meant in an interactive way
[08:44] <Born_In_Xixax> you can try and install the actual cisco VPN linux client
[08:44] <slavik> cde?
[08:44] <durrie> hmm I think firefox has a plugin called something like imgopera that either blocks all images, blocks some images or just load cached images
[08:44] <Born_In_Xixax> but you have to compile it manually, and i'm not up for that tongiht :)
[08:44] <durrie> I guess that would help a bit
[08:44] <koza> common desktop environment
[08:44] <koza> slavik, common desktop environment
[08:44] <hockyhair> it wasn't baobab but it looks the same i'll try, thanks
[08:44] <Paladinew> Born, no problem, I really appreciate your help, I got 100% further than any other attempt.  Thank you
[08:44] <slavik> can't say i used it
[08:44] <Jewfro-Macabbi> roughtrader, that's the only way I know.....
[08:45] <Born_In_Xixax> i think you're just down to getting passwords in the right place...so good luck
[08:45] <roughtrader> thanks jewfro
[08:45] <koza> anyone used open motif too pls
[08:45] <Paladinew> k, I'll play with it for awhile.  Thanks again!   =)
[08:45] <UTENTE> later
[08:46] <Daylighter> I think I'm going to switch to xchat
[08:46] <Paladinew> good night all!
[08:47] <SilentDis> stupid question:  is there any way to get apt to check an ISO for files, rather than prompting me for my CD?  basically, i hate continually digging this stupid thing out every time I need it lol
[08:47] <SpAc> I'm trying to install driver for my Nvidia graphics card... is this a good place to start? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[08:47] <SilentDis> hmm... I suppose I could mount it on /cdrom... let me try that rofl
[08:47] <SpAc> as soon as I run sudo nvidia-glx-config enable I get an error saying it was unable to find the appropriate Kernel driver
[08:48] <Crankymonky> nothlit, that would change where grub looks when booting my pc?  I don't see setup or root in grub's manpage, that's why I ask
[08:49] <Crankymonky> It makes sense, just want to confirm
=== cari_tmen_ce_ is now known as cw_asmara
[08:49] <SilentDis> that worked rofl
[08:49] <Born_In_Xixax> last minute thoughts on the way upstairs
[08:49] <Born_In_Xixax> is that r.e. the accelerator?
[08:50] <Born_In_Xixax> anyway: could you install IE into wine (or crossover) and then install the Netscape accelrator into the same bottle?
[08:50] <durrie> r.e.?
[08:50] <durrie> hmm
[08:50] <durrie> well the accelerator works on firefox perfectly fine
[08:50] <durrie> so you don't really need IE at all
[08:51] <Born_In_Xixax> i see
[08:51] <durrie> althought the accelerator does need the dialer program to work
[08:51] <durrie> although^
[08:51] <SilentDis> Born_In_Xixax: nope.  the accel needs to have access to a windows registry usually.  the app 'runs' but doesn't do anything :P
[08:51] <Born_In_Xixax> ah, i see
[08:51] <durrie> so without that it will not open nor work
[08:51] <Born_In_Xixax> it would have access to the simulated registry under wine
[08:51] <Gasten> Hello. How do I start up and run jack?
[08:51] <Born_In_Xixax> but all this 'has to use the dialer' stuff is a problem

[08:57] <SilentDis> grrr... WHY is it so hard to get marketing reps to understand the difference between bandwidth and latency?  *sigh*
[08:57] <Doow> Hmm.. Anjuta complains that I need to have glib installed, According to synaptic I have both packages libglib1.2 and libglib2.0 installed, is there some other package that anjuta needs? (just trying to create a simple c++ project atm)
[08:57] <SilentDis> trying to get latency info about a long-range wireless service in my area.  they keep sending me bandwidth numbers :P
[08:57] <Doow> haha
[08:57] <durrie> haha
[08:58] <durrie> tell them latency comes in MS not MB
[08:59] <SilentDis> durrie:  tried that.  i guess I'll have to call 'em tomorrow :P
[08:59] <Born_In_Xixax> tell them the one matters when they're playing counterstrike, the other when they're downloading porn

[09:07] <gbu> Hello.I am trying to install shockwave with crossover and it is asking for a netscape plugins folder.What folder is that?
[09:07] <preaction> Doow, google is your friend?
[09:08] <Doow> preaction, yes, yes it is
[09:08] <preaction> gbu, um... you're trying to install the shockwave plugin for windows and expect it to work with a linux-compiled browser?
[09:08] <gbu> im using crossover
[09:10] <preaction> gbu, i'm assuming by "crossover" you mean a windows emulator, much like wine
[09:10] <preaction> gbu, these emulators run programs, not just plugins
[09:10] <nothlit> preaction, WINE = <W>ine <I>s <N>ot an <E>mulator
[09:11] <Daylighter> recursive acronyms!
[09:11] <preaction> nothlit, semantics
[09:11] <gbu> yes but how do i install shockwave?
[09:11] <nothlit> gbu, what browser are you using in crossover
[09:11] <nothlit> gbu, you install shockwave through crossover by installing IE first
[09:12] <gbu> swiftfox and opera
[09:12] <nothlit> gbu, or install it for a linux browser, but thats a different method of installation, and a different binary for shockwave
[09:13] <preaction> nothlit, there is no shockwave for linux. there's a flash player 9 beta, but no shockwave
[09:13] <gbu> but what should I do?
[09:13] <koza> can you guys pls help me install openmotife
[09:13] <koza> can you guys pls help me install openmotif
[09:13] <preaction> gbu, basically what you'll do is run IE or Firefox or whatever inside of Crossover, and install the plugin on that browser
[09:13] <koza> i really wanna learn bash but i cant install open motif
[09:14] <nothlit> gbu, install internet explorer first
[09:14] <gbu> ok
[09:14] <nothlit> gbu or you can try this, but it would probably take more effort https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave?highlight=%28shockwave%29
[09:15] <preaction> would i be correct in assuming that crossover is a fork of wine?

[09:18] <Lathiat> tripppy: the 6.06.1 iso has a few more updates IIRC yes
[09:18] <roycebarber> I dont plan on actually installing Ubuntu 7.04 any time soon, i just request info so i can help out the community in any way i can.
[09:18] <preaction> koza, perhaps first you should try to search your package manager for it?
[09:18] <nothlit> tripppy, like lathiat said earlier, update one machine, and then copy the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives to all the other computers
[09:18] <preaction> koza, instead of repeating yourself 5 times, perhaps?
[09:18] <nothlit> roycebarber, then try the dev forum for feisty fawn on ubuntuforums.org
[09:19] <boodzut> yo, why when i setup a config and i have it in my home directory and when i sudo it to /etc* folder my config file type goes to unknown?
[09:19] <boodzut> but stil has extension of .conf
[09:19] <tripppy> nothlit, thanks for xplaining it better. i havent really worked out networking between ubuntu's, and what ive read about Samba shares doesnt work.
[09:19] <nothlit> boodzut, what do you mean sudo it? you mean sudo mv it?
[09:19] <preaction> boodzut, what do you mean file type?
[09:19] <koza> preaction,  hmm my package manager isnt showing openmotif
[09:19] <boodzut> like
[09:19] <boodzut> sudo cp
[09:19] <luminousnerd> Anyone used Beryl?
[09:19] <nothlit> tripppy, thats because you need to set smbpasswd or set the share level lower, its annoying and difficult i know
[09:20] <nothlit> tripppy, but you can always use ssh or nfs
[09:20] <Lathiat> boodzut: nautilus tends to use a 2-stage file identification phase, the first is based on extension, layer if you click on it, or it gets time, it shows it based on the contents of the file, possibly what you are seeing?
[09:20] <preaction> koza, apt-cache search open motif <- there's a package in there you might be interested in
[09:20] <CarinArr> ;)
[09:20] <nothlit> tripppy, or burn it or put it on a usb disc
[09:20] <luminousnerd> I'm not sure how I would go about getting beryl on Ubuntu--is it even possible?
[09:20] <ademan> !beryl
[09:20] <tripppy> nothlit, yeah. ssh and nfs are alien to me, i was could burn it or USB it.? what size is it.... 900mb?
[09:20] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:20] <preaction> luminousnerd, i believe there's an entire IRC channel devoted to it
[09:21] <boodzut> nvm sudo mv worked
[09:21] <tripppy> nothlit, ignore my question
[09:21] <Lathiat> tripppy: you could copy from usb but to copy back you need to be root.. so youd probably have to use a command line perhaps
[09:21] <luminousnerd> preaction to just beryl or beryl on ubuntu lol
[09:21] <nothlit> tripppy, no all you need to do is place the .deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives onto a usb drive
[09:21] <preaction> luminousnerd, beryl on ubuntu, see what ubotu told you
[09:21] <nothlit> tripppy, or you can use gksudo nautilus
[09:21] <roth-laptop> i run beryl on ubuntu
[09:22] <tripppy> nothlit, kk. will try that.
[09:22] <tripppy> wooot thankx #UBUNTU!
[09:22] <luminousnerd> preaction, didn't get anything from ubotu
[09:22] <preaction> luminousnerd, yeah, ubotu just told the channel
[09:22] <nothlit> luminousnerd, oh getting beryl was a relatively simple process for me, on both dapper and edgy
[09:22] <preaction> !beryl > luminousnerd
[09:22] <totall_6_7> trippy??
[09:22] <luminousnerd> Oh, nvm, I did just further up than I expected

[09:28] <incorrect> oh no it just takes a really long time
[09:28] <gbu> Hello.When I try to install windows firefox with crossover it also closes.Do I need to install windows notepad?
[09:28] <pipipi> anybody have experience with VLC Media Player?
[09:29] <pipipi> For some reason when I play .wmv files, it doesn't show Video or sometimes show Audio.
[09:29] <pipipi> And I can't figure out if it needs Codecs, or if something else is wrong here.
[09:29] <incorrect> gbu. funny
[09:29] <pipipi> undf, and MSS2 is the Codecs I believe
[09:29] <foxure> gbu: I don't kno.. but why are you installing firefox in crossover office?
[09:29] <incorrect> pipipi: i had the same issue you need to change your video config to output to the right subsystem
[09:29] <pipipi> do you know if VLC Meida Player can install those?
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[09:29] <pipipi> incorrect: where do I do that?
[09:30] <gbu> To install shockwave.
[09:30] <incorrect> pipipi: i know the problem is common to all media players,  however i haven't used vlc
[09:31] <pipipi> incorrect: I see... Hrmm... I see  Video > Output modules > Xvideo,X11,OpenGL,Image File
[09:31] <pipipi> I'm not sure if that's it.
[09:31] <boodzut> yo with vsftpd why when i start it i get a message box trying to connect to the FTP with the message saying 500: oops child died
[09:31] <incorrect> pipipi: yes that sounds right
[09:31] <nothlit> pipipi, you can try installing w32codecs, but vlc has all the codecs built into it on linux
[09:31] <pipipi> incorrect: but, which one would it be though?
[09:31] <incorrect> x11 could be a safe bet
[09:31] <gbu> But why does it close on the license page.Do I need a newer version of wine?
[09:31] <nothlit> pipipi, you can try playing them with gxine or mplayer
[09:31] <incorrect> depends on your xorg config
[09:31] <pipipi> ok, ill try
[09:32] <pipipi> nothlit: where are the w32codecs ? i dont find it with apt-cache search
[09:32] <foxure> gbu: . ok.. maybe you could try to install via wine instead and test
[09:32] <nothlit> pipipi, you have to download it manually and install it with dpkg -i   or its also in seveas's repository
[09:32] <pipipi> ok, thanks
=== cyanide is now known as _cyanide
[09:33] <gbu> I already tried it with the wine in the repositories.
[09:33] <CarinArr> pipipi you could try checking seveas repos as well
[09:33] <nothlit> gbu, i told you to install internet explorer and do it, and no firefox doesn't need anything special in wine, i installed it before with no pre setup
[09:33] <CarinArr> tho i twasn't built the other day
[09:33] <pipipi> im trying to find it :)
[09:33] <pipipi> google don't show much about  seveas repos
[09:34] <nothlit> pipipi, mirror.ubuntulinux.nl
[09:34] <CarinArr> never mind, still not built
[09:34] <nothlit> pipipi, whatever you do don't use seveas.ubuntulinux.nl, its not the correct one for regular use its only mirrored from
[09:34] <pipipi> k, thanks
[09:35] <nofxx> hey... 6.10 will be better or worst to my wi-fi ndiswrapper setup?
[09:36] <luminousnerd> How come I can't su to root?
[09:36] <luminousnerd> Wouldn't that be easier than sudoing everyhting I do?
[09:36] <preaction> luminousnerd, sudo su -
[09:36] <CarinArr> !sudo
[09:36] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:36] <rausb0> preaction: sudo -s
[09:36] <luminousnerd> ah thanks!
[09:36] <luminousnerd> different from slack lol
[09:36] <nofxx> su -s ?
[09:37] <nothlit> CarinArr, w32codecs: Installed: 1:20060611-0.0 500 http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl edgy-seveas/all Packages
[09:37] <nofxx> xD
[09:37] <CarinArr> nothlit, hm?
[09:38] <nothlit> luminousnerd, because sudo is relatively safer and easier, but you can use sudo -i (for login, uses root's variables) and sudo -s for shell, keeps user variables, both these commands will still log sudo's use
[09:39] <nothlit> luminousnerd, but remember to use gksudo/gksu for graphical programs or it'll mess with your ICEauthority
[09:39] <CarinArr> nothlit, was looking at http://seveas.theplayboymansion.net/seveas/dists/edgy-seveas/all/
[09:39] <Gasten> Hello. How do I run JACK audio-server?
[09:39] <CarinArr> first one that googles up
=== whaq|off is now known as whaq
[09:39] <CarinArr> assumed it was an up to date mirror
[09:39] <nothlit> CarinArr, ahh
[09:40] <CarinArr> so yeah, my poo poo:)
[09:40] <incorrect> what are the packages from freecontrib.org ?
[09:40] <nothlit> Gasten, you have to install all the jack related packages sift through aptitude search jack
[09:40] <Gasten> nothlit: I have done aptitude install jack. doesn't that do it?
[09:41] <nothlit> Gasten, please reread what i said again, especially the last part.
[09:42] <luminousnerd> If it tells me to run this I'm not sure what I do
[09:42] <luminousnerd>  sudo wget http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz/quinn.key.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add -
[09:42] <nothlit> Gasten, also, you do know the package jack is a cd ripping program and not the sound server
[09:42] <luminousnerd> What's up with the - without anoption and the |
[09:42] <Gasten> nothlit: Well, I might have downloaded that one...
[09:42] <nofxx> is 6.10 more wi-fi friendly !?!?
[09:42] <nothlit> luminousnerd, the  | send the output of the last command to the next one and - means take from standard input
[09:42] <luminousnerd> hmm
[09:43] <nothlit> nofxx, calm down, if someone knows they will answer
[09:43] <luminousnerd> nothlit I'm trying to follow this guide on getting beryl and when I run that command verbatim I get "gpg: can't open `': No such file or directory"
[09:43] <CarinArr> nofxx, i suppose that depends what card you're trying ot use;)
[09:43] <nofxx> nothlit , hehe sorry man.... i go freak when I see some minor version upgrade xDD
[09:44] <nofxx> CarinArr , its a pcmcia msi cb54g ...
[09:44] <nothlit> luminousnerd, cd to ~/ first and try again
[09:44] <Acke_ubu> hey .... i cant find wepattack in synaptic.... whats that? it was there in 6.06. but not in 6.10
[09:44] <CarinArr> nofxx, have you checked it's supported
[09:44] <luminousnerd> nothlit gpg: no valid openpgp data found
[09:45] <nofxx> CarinArr , that I'm not sure about the chipset... so i'm going to try ndiswraper for wpa... current setup only works with no encryption at all
[09:45] <nofxx> CarinArr , yea.. i had some problems... with 6.06
[09:45] <nothlit> luminousnerd, download it manually, system>administration>software sources> take it from there
[09:45] <luminousnerd> Oh damn
[09:45] <luminousnerd> capitalization matters
[09:46] <luminousnerd> so sorry
[09:46] <nothlit> luminousnerd, lol first rule of linux :P
[09:46] <luminousnerd> kinda hard looking from the mac to the linux box XD
[09:46] <nothlit> luminousnerd, i don't see a capitalisation error from what you pasted
[09:46] <CarinArr> nofxx, not even standard WEP encryption?
[09:47] <nothlit> luminousnerd, lol don't worry when using two comps i end up using the keyboard of one and the mouse of the other /vice versa
[09:47] <luminousnerd> Didn't paste nothlit, it was retyped, but same thing..anyway it worked when I capitalized the O
[09:47] <luminousnerd> Lol!
[09:47] <luminousnerd> :)
[09:47] <nothlit> luminousnerd, ahh, thats why i always copy/paste commands ^^
[09:48] <nothlit> luminousnerd, even in terminal
[09:48] <nothlit> luminousnerd, err console
[09:48] <nofxx> CarinArr , from the network manager GUI... no man... you see , ubuntu detected it all for me.. i didn't change nothing... wi-fi radar aways finds and connects and finds IP (only says it... it dosent work either)
[09:48] <luminousnerd> nothlit but I can't c/p across computers
[09:48] <luminousnerd> Or else I would
[09:48] <luminousnerd> :)
[09:49] <CarinArr> nofxx, i can't use network-admin kwifimanager whatever else on my desktop
[09:49] <nofxx> CarinArr , so maybe I some work could make wep works... but wpa was a no-go....  wpa_supplicant freezed
[09:49] <CarinArr> tho it works fine if i set it up using iwconfig
[09:49] <luminousnerd> It would be a nifty little app, if someone wrote a cross-platform toy that would allow you to get the clipboards of networked computers
[09:49] <CarinArr> nofxx, i haven't ever had to use wpa so i'm afraid i can't really help out on that
[09:49] <leafw> where are the mounted file systems (that show on the desktop) in the file system?
[09:50] <leafw> For example, a mounted ssh
[09:50] <CarinArr> a mounted ssh?!
[09:50] <leafw> a "volume"
[09:50] <leafw> whatever you want to call it
[09:50] <leafw> a remote server.
[09:50] <rausb0> leafw: is it really mounted or just display in nautilus?
[09:50] <luminousnerd> nothlit, now it's telling me to sudo nano /usr/bin/startxgl.sh
[09:50] <luminousnerd> But the file doesn't exist
[09:51] <leafw> can't see them in xmms or in blender file browsers
[09:51] <CarinArr> leafw, do you mean smb?
[09:51] <leafw> smb-like, but ssh
[09:51] <nothlit> luminousnerd, thats why you can use ssh or gpm, screen, console browsers, anyways i assume you have a desktop environment up and running anyways since you're trying to start beryl
[09:51] <leafw> using the "connect to server..." command.
[09:51] <nothlit> luminousnerd, the whole point is using nano to create the file at the same time as writing to it
[09:51] <leafw> or is this really different from the sshfs mounted volumes?
[09:52] <nothlit> luminousnerd, remember to always append -w to nano or write a bashrc alias for it
[09:52] <rausb0> leafw: nautilus can make ssh access appear to be "mounted" but actually it is only visible in nautilus. however, there is a way to do real ssh mounts. look for sshfs.
[09:52] <luminousnerd> nothlit, oh...
[09:52] <luminousnerd> I'm confused
[09:52] <leafw> rausb0 : I know sshfs, I though the gnome vfs would be doing something similar
[09:52] <leafw> nm, thanks
[09:53] <nothlit> rausb0, do you know the best FUSE based transparent compression (which is the best)
[09:53] <rausb0> leafw: no, gnome vfs is entirely in userspace. no kernel vfs involved.
[09:53] <rausb0> nothlit: sorry, don't know
[09:53] <ebaad> hi, I need help connecting to mysql server
=== SiCuTDeUx_ is now known as SiCuTDeUx
[09:53] <ebaad> can somebody please help me with mysql server
[09:53] <leafw> rausb0 : in any case, it'd be nice to have file system hooks into this mounted volumes.
[09:53] <ste> Hi. Does anyone know about existing beryl 0.1.2 packages?
[09:53] <leafw> rausb0 : besides sshfs, that is.
[09:54] <rausb0> leafw: i would use sshfs instead of gnome-specific things anyway
[09:54] <snadge> http://linuxps3.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=2
[09:54] <snadge> good news :) if anyone is interested in kernel patches to boot linux on ps3.. there they are.. enjoy ;)
[09:54] <rausb0> leafw: or shfs, but unfortunately shfs seems to be dead
[09:55] <ebaad> hello any body with mysql, I need help
[09:55] <leafw> rausb0 : sshfs then :)
[09:55] <snadge> and what happened to #ubuntu-ppc ?
[09:56] <Acke_ubu> !wepattack
[09:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wepattack - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:56] <CarinArr> ebaad, what's the problem
[09:56] <rausb0> leafw: i used shfs with kernel 2.6.12 and found it more stable than sshfs
=== eggzeck_ is now known as eggzeck[laptop] 
[09:56] <rausb0> leafw: (shfs uses ssh too)
[09:56] <leafw> I never used shfs, man, it reads so similar to sshfs I don't know whther its a typo
[09:57] <ebaad> I have the mysql admin gui installed and trying to connect to the server can connect to it from cli but not from gui
[09:57] <ebaad> It gives me Nr: 2003 error when trying to connect

[09:59] <CarinArr> ebaad, are you trying these from the same machine?
[09:59] <leafw> ok sentry out
[09:59] <nothlit> gilan, take out the www. putting the unnecessary www is BAD BAD BAD
[09:59] <ebaad> yes they are on the same machine
[10:00] <Acke_ubu> hey i have a seagate hd on 250gb in an external case. However it only shows up as 128gb!! in gparted. any ideas on how to get at it, finding the fault??
[10:00] <gilan> nothlit: thank you very much
[10:01] <luminousnerd> Eh...
[10:01] <luminousnerd> That was weird
[10:01] <luminousnerd> I followed the guide to install beryl, now when I log into ubuntu it flashes the beryl logo and then goes back to the login screen again
[10:02] <luminousnerd> After black-screening for roughly 20 seconds

[10:04] <koza> i need help with mwm
[10:05] <koza> and menus with it
[10:05] <nothlit> luminousnerd, take out the horrible auto session entries and start beryl-manager manually in a terminal and then go google the error
[10:06] <cako> does anyone have any pointers on how I can detect/see the contents of my digital camera? I'm using a Caplio RX.
[10:06] <snadge> nobody can comment on the status of ubuntu ppc? the channel being dropped doesnt look like a good sign...

[10:07] <Morrowyn> morning
[10:07] <koza> hi
[10:08] <koza> Morrowyn,
[10:08] <nothlit> cako, just make sure if there is more than one mode that your digital camera is in USB MASS STORAGE
[10:08] <koza> hi nothlit
[10:08] <nothlit> cako, after that it should work identical to a usb drive, the computer won't know the difference
[10:09] <cako> thanks, i'l give it a go
[10:10] <blind> I installed the jre, and it works in epiphany, but not in firefox, how can i fix this?
[10:11] <luminousnerd> nothlit umm...I don't know what auto session entries are...
[10:11] <luminousnerd> And I'm not sure what the command is to start beryl
[10:11] <luminousnerd> or gnome
[10:11] <blind> beryl-manager
[10:11] <luminousnerd> or whatever I'm supposed to start
[10:11] <adamc> blind: you'll need to create a symlink in your mozilla plugins directory
[10:11] <CarinArr> heh
[10:11] <koza> how do i get mwm and the menus to work
[10:11] <blind> adamc: to what?
[10:12] <luminousnerd> blind, ran that and nothing happened
[10:12] <snadge> WTF!!?! im reading code written by sony.. thats GPLed.. am I seeing things!? can somebody please pinch me and tell me I'm not dreaming ;)
[10:12] <luminousnerd> no errors or anything at all
[10:12] <blind> luminousnerd: do you have the beryl gem in the top right?
[10:12] <luminousnerd> uh..
[10:12] <luminousnerd> it's terminal only
[10:12] <blind> luminousnerd: oh. log into gnome.
[10:13] <nothlit> luminousnerd, you added them ,beryl and beryl-manager, thats why the splash screen shows up when you log in
[10:13] <luminousnerd> blind but I can't...
[10:13] <snadge> i just cant believe that sony have released the extensions to linux to support the PS3.. under the GPL, i think thats incredible.. i can't wait to see ubuntu boot on one of these babies :)
[10:13] <blind> luminousnerd: why not?
[10:13] <luminousnerd> That's the whole problem..
[10:13] <nothlit> snadge O_O O_O O_O really? omgs
[10:13] <adamc> blind: usually, $JAVA_HOME/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
[10:13] <blind> luminousnerd: you'll be able to get better support in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:13] <luminousnerd> nothlit okay, but how would I get rid of them since I can't get back into gnome now
[10:13] <snadge> nothlit, i can provide link to download patches if you want :) .. or you can look in scrollback
[10:14] <luminousnerd> blind that's not true, as no one's there at all :)
[10:14] <adamc> blind: ymmv if you installed the distro package, I usually just download it from sun.
[10:14] <blind> adamc: i did both :P
[10:14] <nothlit> luminousnerd, try the safety/fallback login to gnome
[10:14] <luminousnerd> eh...
[10:14] <adamc> blind: ~/.mozilla/plugins?
[10:14] <nothlit> luminousnerd, in gdm, you can choose options, including sessions, look in there
[10:14] <blind> adamc: no java in there, only flash
[10:14] <nothlit> luminousnerd, i thought you said you were a slackware user
[10:15] <luminousnerd> I was several months ago
[10:15] <luminousnerd> I forgot a lot about it
[10:15] <luminousnerd> And I never used gnome
[10:15] <nothlit> flux?
[10:15] <luminousnerd> startx was all I knew about this lol
[10:15] <luminousnerd> Umm, I used E17 mostly
[10:15] <luminousnerd> and some KDE but I hated it
[10:15] <adamc> blind: right, you need to do something like : cd ~/.mozilla/plugins; ln -s $JAVA_HOME/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
[10:15] <ameyer> also, sometimes beryl is a little touchy if you've been logged in
[10:15] <nothlit> startx lol
[10:16] <luminousnerd> nothlit so how to get to gdm if I cant log in
[10:16] <adamc> blind: dunno if ubuntu's package does that automagically or not, but you definitely have to do it manually if you downloaded the JDK or JRE from Sun.
[10:16] <ameyer> it might help if you "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
[10:17] <nothlit> luminousnerd, umm, gdm is what you log into silly
[10:17] <ameyer> luminousnerd: control-alt-f2 to get to a login prompt then do what I said
[10:17] <blind> adamc: i made the symlink, but it still isn't working.
[10:17] <nothlit> luminousnerd, its the whole graphical login server (which is very themable btw)
[10:17] <adamc> bilnd: did you restart firefox?  close *all* windows?
[10:17] <luminousnerd> Okay I did what ameyer said
[10:18] <CarinArr> as far as i'm aware there's no way to use beryl+fluxbox so it rules it out for me:/
[10:18] <ameyer> beryl might be ok eventually, it's a hog and very unstable right now IMO
[10:18] <Flannel> blind: the repositories have a FF plugin, why are you bothering with sun downloads?
[10:18] <nothlit> ameyer, hey do you know why ubuntu boot messages are on both virtual console 1 and 8?
[10:18] <blind> adamc: yes. i went to file > quit
[10:18] <blind> Flannel: it's not working.
[10:18] <ameyer> nothlit: no clue
[10:18] <blind> Flannel: sun-java5-plugin ?
[10:18] <Flannel> blind: you installed sun-java5-plugin?
[10:18] <blind> Flannel: yes. it works in epiphany, but not FF
[10:18] <luminousnerd> *REBOOT* lol
[10:19] <Flannel> blind: and you have the normal FF version?
[10:19] <blind> Flannel: FF2.0
[10:19] <ameyer> don't go to feisty to fix it, it's still broken there
[10:19] <ameyer> I suspect it's firefox
[10:19] <Flannel> blind: and this is in Edgy?
[10:19] <nothlit> luminousnerd, why do you need to reboot, anyways you can just do s /etc/init.d/gdm restart (combo move ;) and   reload is good for reloading config files in services
[10:20] <adamc> blind: pkill -f firefox >=)
[10:20] <ameyer> even with the mozilla.org build of firefox it's borked
[10:20] <blind> Flannel: yes.
[10:20] <luminousnerd> One thing linux is slow at is booting up :(
[10:20] <CarinArr> i dunno.. my laptop boots ubuntu very quickly
[10:20] <nothlit> luminousnerd, depends what distros, ubuntu isn't very slim at all
[10:20] <koza> where do i get xorg manuals
[10:20] <CarinArr> my desktop for some reason forces fsck every startup under edgy
[10:21] <nothlit> luminousnerd, things like vector/yoper can boot in less than 15 secs
=== whaq|away is now known as whaq
[10:21] <luminousnerd> I despise yoper.
[10:21] <koza> where do i get X manuals
[10:21] <adamc> blind: dunno how to help at this point, I'm working on a fresh install and I *just* made the symlink and there the java plugin is ...
[10:21] <ameyer> koza: man xorg?
[10:21] <nothlit> Koza go google it for the more extensive documentation, or go to X.org 's website
[10:21] <blind> adamc: the plugin in the ~/.mozilla/plugins is named libjavaplugin_oji.so  ?
[10:21] <adamc> blind: what does ls -l ~/.mozilla/plugins tell you?
[10:21] <luminousnerd> Wow...I have one awesome proc yet ubuntu is taking like two minutes
[10:21] <Flannel> koza: which happens to be http://www.x.org
[10:22] <adamc> you betcha
[10:22] <CarinArr> luminousnerd, two minutes?!
[10:22] <blind> i have libjavaplugin_oji.so symlinked in, but it's not working :|
[10:22] <adamc> and it's symlinked to where?
[10:22] <CarinArr> luminousnerd, does it swap to text based half way through by any chance?
[10:22] <blind> adamc: that dir you have me earlier.
[10:22] <nothlit> luminousnerd, one thing is you don't really ever have to restart a linux box unless you want to load a fresh kernel :P negates the boot times if you never shut it off
[10:22] <luminousnerd> okay now after rebooting it still doesn't work
[10:23] <adamc> feel free to anonymize, but just to make sure, paste it
[10:23] <blind> adamc: $JAVA_HOME/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
[10:23] <malv> any fix in sight for the nautilus bug?
[10:23] <luminousnerd> blind, during boot or attempting to load gnome/beryl?
[10:23] <nothlit> luminousnerd, wait, you lost your graphical login? or afterwards
[10:23] <blind> luminousnerd: what?
[10:23] <ameyer> nothlit: unless x badly locks up due to a bug in the i810 driver ;)
[10:23] <luminousnerd> The graphical login still runs
[10:23] <blind> but...?
[10:23] <adamc> blind: lterally, "$JAVA_HOME" or did you anonymize that?
[10:23] <qdk> I have a strange charset issue in Ubuntu 6.10 server. I can make a file with special chars, but when I do a 'ls' the chars are just '?', but if I pipe the output from 'ls' over to 'tail' the chars a rendered correctly... I also have a related issue where some chars are rendered wrong like in 'man', 'mc' and such. how do I fix this/these issues?
[10:23] <CarinArr> luminousnerd, if that was for me, i meant, during boot does it swap from the progress bar to text based?
[10:24] <nothlit> luminousnerd, again, what we told you was just to fix gdm, not login issues/beryl, to do that you need to remove the gnome session entries
[10:24] <blind> adamc: i literally used $JAVA_HOME ;x
[10:24] <luminousnerd> but when I enter my username and pass, it shows the startup screen normally, then shows a beryl logo, then goes black (with a small cursor up at the top) for about 20 seconds and goes back to the graphical login.
[10:24] <nothlit> luminousnerd, if are having difficulties doing that, start another x session without gnome and load gnome-session-manager
[10:24] <adamc> blind: where's your Java installation?  You used the .deb from ubuntu's repos?
[10:25] <luminousnerd> nothlit it won't let you do a second x session though will it?
[10:25] <blind> adamc: i did both the deb from the repo and the rpm from sun (alien'd it, of course)
[10:25] <nothlit> luminousnerd, like i said, that means beryl is having an issue and you need to remove the autostart session entry, and if you want to fix it diagnose the error messages from a terminal
[10:25] <luminousnerd> Okay but I still don't know how to get rid of the entry without actually logging into gnome
[10:26] <adamc> blind: hrm, then.  I usually get the .bin from Sun, but that's because I do java dev.
[10:26] <aughii> how can .deb files be install via terminal. With terminal command?
[10:26] <aughii> be installed, even
[10:26] <adamc> aughii: dpkg -i [debfile] 
[10:26] <aughii> adamc: thx
[10:26] <nothlit> luminousnerd, ctrl+alt+f1 xinit gnome-session-properties -- :1
[10:26] <adamc> aughii: err, sudo that ...
[10:27] <aughii> adamc: IC :)
[10:27] <luminousnerd> Whoa
[10:27] <luminousnerd> That didn't go well
[10:27] <luminousnerd> nothlit thanks, it came up with lots of errors
[10:27] <luminousnerd> sorry that sounded sarcastic was not meant to be
[10:28] <nothlit> luminousnerd, beryl-manager?
[10:28] <nothlit> luminousnerd, or gnome-session-properties?
[10:28] <luminousnerd> returns nothing
[10:28] <adamc> blind: if you have a colour terminal, what colour is the symlink in the plugin dir?
[10:28] <ameyer> they might not be errors per se
[10:28] <blind> adamc: red.
[10:28] <adamc> blind: then it's not pointing at a file that exists.
[10:28] <luminousnerd> gtk-warning **: cannot open display
[10:28] <blind> adamc: i ran a find for libjavaplugin_oji.so and found it in /etc/alternatives, should i symlink that one?
[10:29] <sg> hi all
[10:29] <adamc> blind: can't hurt to try, but I don't know off the top of my head where that file comes from.
[10:29] <ameyer> blind: hmm, just for fun sudo update-alternatives --config java
[10:29] <nothlit> luminousnerd, just run xinit -- :1 and then type in gnome-session-properties into the graphical terminal

[10:32] <Kream> is it possible to customize the ubuntu alternative install cd ?
[10:33] <nothlit> luminousnerd, lemme see if theres a gconf option, or if you haven't invested to much into your gnome customisation you could just delete .gnome .gnome2 and .gconf, the setting will be somewhere in there
[10:33] <aughii> wow... things have happened since last time I had linux installed on my computer. this is great... or is it? hum... Just click and it actually worked! ;)

[10:37] <Keyseir_> I have a vmware related question: I'd like to configure a directory of some sort on my host OS (ubuntu linux, ext3 format) that both my guest os (XP pro) and host can manipulate. I just need this to be text files.. is this possible?
[10:37] <nothlit> luminousnerd, yeah ctrl alt backspace, make sure you've terminated the xinit i gave you too
[10:37] <Madpilot> Keyseir_, there are ext3 drivers for XP
[10:38] <luminousnerd> still showing the beryl screen nothlit and doing the same thing
[10:38] <Doow> My menus are acting up in Gnome, more specifially I can't log out. Is there some clean way to log out of gnome from the commandline?
[10:38] <Doow> well, cleaner than ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:38] <nothlit> luminousnerd, ok, give me the tutorial you usesd
[10:38] <Keyseir_> Madpilot, Would it be possible to set it up so that vmware xp could only access a specific part of my real HD?
[10:38] <nothlit> Doow,  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[10:38] <luminousnerd> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/XGL
[10:38] <dooglus> Keyseir_: you can mount a file as a FAT32 filesystem using a loopback mount.  then XP will be able to manipulate it.

[10:42] <rig> hi all
=== Griverr is now known as Griver
[10:42] <dooglus> Keyseir_: does the MUD client need to be able to write them?
[10:43] <dooglus> Keyseir_: actually, since the XP is a guest on Linux, can't you let it access your Linux FS directly?
[10:43] <luminousnerd> nothlit, I can lot in with this new user and no beryl appears.
[10:43] <sg> can anybody read what i said ?
[10:43] <nothlit> luminousnerd, you followed the System -> Administration -> Preferences -> Startup Programs part?
[10:43] <Keyseir_> dooglus, I don't think so, but I'm not positive. I think it just needs to read em.
[10:43] <rig> could anybody tell me guys how to look up which package contains a certain binary (e.g. nfslockd)? thanks
[10:43] <Keyseir_> dooglus, I think I might be able to by installing the ext3 drivers on it... but I don't want it to have access to my whole linux filesystem, just a directory

After I did a cold-reboot, GRUB won't load and now I can't run neither WIndows or Ubuntu...
[10:54] <nothlit> luminousnerd, i know, the whole point was to grab the error messages by starting it in a console or within screen
[10:55] <nothlit> luminousnerd, but if you haven't really started any user settings just delete everything in your old home folder except .bash and .bashrc, or delete the whole thing and then make copies of those files from /etc/skel
[10:56] <nothlit> i mean .bash_logout .bash_profile and .bashrc

[11:05] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: and does aptitude work instead of apt-get?

[11:06] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: tbh?
[11:06] <gnomefreak> to be honest
[11:06] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: Do I need to upgrade apt..?
[11:06] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: you sure your on edgy?

[11:08] <hurax_> ok, i just installed edgy
[11:08] <luminousnerd> Can someone tell me how to delete my old user account?  I don't know how to actually log in as root
[11:09] <trukosh> /var/mail/inbox_of_ordinary_user is not deletable bei the ordinary user. Rights are 600 and owner ist the user. Why is it like this?
[11:09] <nuts7> guys, Ive got a problem, I just apt-get installed vpnc.. but now it wont let me change to /etc/vpnc it says permission denied, that isnt usual is it?!
[11:09] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: with apt i have a feeling thats not gonna be so easy. hold on let me check something
[11:09] <hurax_> first, i'm very disappointed that they remove 32-bit support from the amd64 version
[11:09] <hurax_> which used to run out of the box in dapper
[11:09] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: How do you Accidently upgrade apt to something unstable? Heh
[11:09] <luminousnerd> OMG! What the hell is my root password?  Does ubuntu not have one or what?  It won't let me log in as root with the only password I set on the damn thing :(
[11:09] <SpAc> I installed the 64 build, kernel says '2.6.17-10-generic'
[11:09] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: im checking right now
[11:09] <mattfletcher> luminousnerd: no it doesn't have one
[11:09] <Keyseir> ubotu, tell luminousnerd about sudo
[11:10] <dooglus> Keyseir: you have the correct apt-get for edgy.  gnomefreak is confused I think.
[11:10] <hurax_> after searching i found ia32-libs after which i got at least a libc
[11:10] <luminousnerd> I KNOW ABOUT SUDO
[11:10] <luminousnerd> that has got to be like the fiftieth time someone has done that to me tonight :(
[11:10] <hurax_> but i still need libcurl, libssl etc

[11:10] <gnomefreak> ok much better.
[11:10] <Keyseir> That'd be a relief if my apt wasn't still broken
[11:10] <mattfletcher> well use "sudo passwd root" to set a root password then
[11:10] <luminousnerd> thus defeating the purpose

[11:11] <SpAc> anyone else running edgy with nvidia drivers?
[11:11] <luminousnerd> :)
[11:11] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: after an update of any kind?

[11:11] <hurax_> or you could simply change your username
[11:11] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: does aptitude work
[11:11] <mattfletcher> don't complicate things hurax :)
[11:11] <gothmog_1-50> Julez83 yeah,, that is right
[11:11] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: I've used apt since I did a update of some kind.. unless you count sudo apt-get update
[11:11] <dooglus> luminousnerd: make a new user with sudo permissions

[11:12] <inc-inc> SpAc: yeh, im running the latest nvidia drivers 1.0.9xxx

[11:12] <SpAc> inc-inc, did you use apt?
[11:12] <gnomefreak> inc-inc: they are not the latest in ubuntu
[11:12] <mattfletcher> Any asterisk users on then? I want to use the repo version instead of compiling from source, but I need to know if I will be able to get my UNISTIM devices (Nortel IP Phones) working with it
[11:12] <gothmog_1-50> Julez83: do you have a jabber or a icq account?

[11:14] <luminousnerd> fsck, beryl still runs!!!!!
[11:14] <Keyseir> gnomefreak, Unless this messes up while or after downloading, evidently aptitude is working
[11:14] <nuts7> gnomefreak: Im sorry then :D
[11:14] <gothmog_1-50> i did't find anything

[11:14] <SpAc> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[11:14] <cako> can I view the SD card manually somehow?
[11:14] <joss|newbie> can anybody help a newbie with playing dvds??
[11:14] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: Can I do that while aptitude is downloading stuff, or should I cancel my download and do that?
[11:14] <nuts7> Can anyone tell me the command to get into "Networking" ???
[11:15] <luminousnerd> WHY!!! :( It won't stop running no matter what I do...Beryl keeps running with Gnome!!! and it crashes it! :(
[11:15] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: aptitude is downloading things than it works
[11:15] <gothmog_1-50> I could send you an email, I you want

[11:16] <SpAc> both already the newest version :S
[11:16] <gothmog_1-50> whats your adress?
[11:16] <Keyseir> gnomefreak, I guess we've determine that I have a problem with "apt-get" not "apt" or "aptitude"
[11:16] <joss|newbie> is there something like a helpchannel?
[11:16] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: apt-cache policy apt     does that work?
[11:16] <Julez83> Gothmog_1-50: Juliantest@hotmail.com
[11:16] <Keyseir> gnomefreak: yes
[11:16] <foreverconnected> hi there everyone :P
[11:17] <joss|newbie> hi
[11:17] <SpAc> inc-inc: obviously missing something simple here!
[11:17] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: there is no seen reason why that shouldnt be wortking.
[11:17] <foreverconnected> quick question: anyone else notice samba partially broke on edgy?
[11:17] <SpAc> why would it be throwing me this mesasge?
[11:17] <gothmog_1-50> ok, thanks I will drop you an line today
[11:17] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: apt == apt-get
[11:17] <Keyseir> gnomefreak, well, it isn't working
[11:17] <gothmog_1-50> I hope it will help you
[11:17] <gothmog_1-50> bye
[11:17] <nuts7> Can anyone tell me the command to get into "Networking" ???
[11:17] <SpAc> something to do wiht me running the 64 build?
[11:18] <inc-inc> SpAc: just edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and replace "nv" with "nvidia" in the device section
[11:18] <SpAc> It is a FRESH install straight from the 6.10 64bit CD
[11:18] <foreverconnected> it's kinda strange, I can push files to windows servers, but I can't setup shares, and re-installing samba fails
[11:18] <SpAc> inc-inc: ok.... trying it now
[11:18] <foreverconnected> anyone else noticed this?
[11:19] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: i would say try to reinstall it using aptitude (there should be a install --reinstall type command. try aptitude --help to see what flasg you can use. if that doesnt work please file a bug with launchpad on the issue and include any logs for apt in /var/crash
[11:19] <gnomefreak> Keyseir: i have to get on the road. see everyone in a week or so
[11:19] <Keyseir> gnomefreak, thanks for the help
[11:19] <inc-inc> SpAc: I don't know much about the 64 bit builds, you may need to do something special to get it to work, but theres lots of info in the ubuntu forums
[11:20] <SpAc> inc-inc: interesting, at the moment it reads... Device          "Generic Video Card"
[11:20] <oyvind> Is there a way to change the reply-format in evolution ? The date is all wrong in my locale (Norwegian), and I'd like to change some other things as well...
[11:20] <foreverconnected> spac, did you install your video card?
[11:20] <foreverconnected> (it had to be asked)
[11:20] <joss|newbie> ?
[11:21] <SpAc> foreverconnected: isn't that what I'm trying to do?
[11:21] <inc-inc> SpAc: thats ok... thats just the default identifyer
[11:21] <inc-inc> SpAc: can u paste ur xorg somewhere for us to look at?
[11:21] <roycebarber> should i reinstall my insane ati video driver after installing a new kernel
[11:22] <SpAc> inc-inc: sure
[11:22] <dooglus> nuts7: do you mean 'gnome-network-preferences'?
[11:22] <inc-inc> SpAc: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[11:23] <nuts7> dooglus: network-admin was what I searched for :) thanx
[11:23] <dooglus> Keyseir: did you get apt-get working again?
[11:23] <nuts7> any idea why, after installing VPNC, it wont let me access /etc/vpnc .. I need to put my config files in there, dont I?
[11:24] <dooglus> nuts7: /etc/vpnc is only accessible for root, because it contains secrets
[11:24] <Julez83> How do I get permission to mkdir and mount in terminal when it says t
[11:24] <SpAc> inc-inc: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31636/
[11:24] <Julez83> that* i dont have permission?
[11:24] <nuts7> dooglus: where do I put config files, you know that
[11:24] <SpAc> inc-inc: thanks so much :)
[11:24] <GnarusLeo> Wich is the best looking movie players out there?
[11:24] <Keyseir> dooglus, no, still trying to figure aptitude out
[11:24] <dooglus> nuts7: use 'gksudo gedit' to edit config files
[11:24] <B-Minus> mplayer with skins
[11:24] <Admiral_Chicago> GnarusLeo: vlc imo
[11:25] <GnarusLeo> Admiral_Chicago, imo?
[11:25] <dooglus> nuts7: the config files go in /etc/vpnc/ - but you need to be root to get in there
[11:25] <foreverconnected> (imo is net slag for in my opinion)
[11:25] <hurax_> so, anyone knows where to find 32bit libraries for edgy amd64?
[11:25] <nuts7> dooglus: yeah, so I just save them by using gksudo gedit ?
[11:25] <nuts7> *there
[11:26] <foreverconnected> sudo fakes a root access for gedit. it allows you to save files that are read-only to normal users.
[11:26] <inc-inc> SpAc: in the section where it says device, change driver from "vesa" to "nvidia" (if you are sure u have it installed correctly)... then restart the gdm (gnome-display-manager) by hitting crtl-alt-backspace
[11:26] <dooglus> nuts7: 'gksudo gedit' will give you an editor which can read and write files in /etc/vpnc/, yes
[11:26] <inc-inc> SpAc: if that stuffs up u will need to recover the file from the command line (are u familiar with vim?)
[11:26] <GnarusLeo> What is VLC IMO ??
[11:26] <SpAc> inc-inc: yep
[11:27] <foreverconnected> GnarusLeo: VLC is videolan. it's a video player
[11:27] <dooglus> GnarusLeo: vlc is the VideoLAN client, and IMO is an acronym for "In My Opinion"
[11:27] <foreverconnected> the term imo is "in my opinion"
[11:27] <joss|newbie> vlc: videolan client
[11:27] <B-Minus> mplayer is great too
[11:27] <foreverconnected> so to answer your question: VLC is the best video player
[11:27] <GnarusLeo> oh, but vlc doesnt look too good though :)
[11:27] <B-Minus> imo better than vlc
[11:27] <foreverconnected> err
[11:27] <SpAc> inc-inc: ok... here goes... guess it will sign me out... brb
[11:27] <dooglus> agreed.  mplayer beats vlc
[11:27] <GnarusLeo> but thanks guys
[11:27] <foreverconnected> mplayer is like vlc but skinnable
[11:27] <joss|newbie> i love vlc
[11:27] <foreverconnected> you have me all confuzzled. :P
[11:27] <GnarusLeo> foreverconnected, oh ..
[11:27] <Julez83> How do I get permission to mkdir and mount in terminal to mount my HDB when it says I don't have permission?
[11:27] <GnarusLeo> hehe
[11:28] <joss|newbie> either log in as root
[11:28] <foreverconnected> Annnnyyyyway... was anyone else noticing samba will NOT work in edgy?
[11:29] <foreverconnected> and that there's some sort of crazy bug going on and I can't setup shares to pull from in m$ boxes?
[11:29] <SpAc> inc-inc: back
[11:29] <inc-inc> SpAc: any luck?
[11:29] <SpAc> well.... i can see stuff!
[11:29] <SpAc> Where do I go to do some config

[11:35] <ubotu> casper: Run a "live" preinstalled system from read-only media. In component main, is extra. Version 1.78 (edgy), package size 34 kB, installed size 236 kB
[11:35] <dooglus> nuts7: commented out doesn't mean 'enabled', it means 'disabled'...
[11:35] <richy_> heey
[11:35] <dooglus> Keyseir: "find"
[11:35] <dooglus> Keyseir: what exactly do you want to search for?
[11:35] <Tarandus> I'm unable to boot PPC ubuntu in a G3 PowerMac
[11:35] <inc-inc> SpAc: nice! there are a few options you can add to ur xorg...
[11:36] <richy_> i have a question, i have set up my web and ftp server, but i would like to add files to my websites using ftp, but it keeps telling me acces denied, 50. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[11:36] <dooglus> Keyseir: "locate" is faster, but works off a database which is up to 24 hours out of date
[11:36] <SpAc> inc-inc: would like to change the refresh rate... guess it's in that file too
[11:36] <hurax_> Tarandus: new world or old world?
[11:36] <Keyseir> dooglus, "smb.conf", but find doesn't seem to find anything
[11:36] <Tarandus> yaboot.conf has partition 2, and it does not find the kernel
[11:36] <wrzask> Are there any specific ubuntu wine issues?
[11:36] <Tarandus> hurax_: How can I find that out?
[11:36] <Keyseir> dooglus: "find: xorg.conf: No such file or directory" I know that exists
[11:36] <hurax_> old world support in linux is rather bad
[11:36] <inc-inc> SpAc: mostly only neccesary if you are using stuff like Beryl or Compiz (i HIGHLY recommend beryl. its very impressive. www.beryl-project.org)
[11:36] <SpAc> inc-inc: you've been a great help. Loaded up Ubuntu on my desktop machine today. Making the switch from Windows. Been using Debian for a while now, but as a server without any GUI. So this X thing is still a bit new ;)
[11:36] <hurax_> what box is it?
[11:37] <Keyseir> dooglus, incidently, locate found xorg.conf
[11:37] <dooglus> Keyseir: "find / -name smb.conf" will search the whole disk, and take a while.  "locate smb.conf" will be much faster, but will only find files which existed last time updatedb was run
[11:37] <Tarandus> hurax_: I think it is 300MHz or 350MHz. What else do you mean by box?
[11:37] <richy_> i have a question, i have set up my web and ftp server, but i would like to add files to my websites using ftp, but it keeps telling me acces denied, 50. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[11:37] <dooglus> Keyseir: 'find' searches from the current directory unless you tell it otherwise
[11:37] <hurax_> what model
[11:37] <Tarandus> hurax_: This is my return to using a mac after about 10 years
[11:37] <inc-inc> SpAc: I made the  switch about 3 months ago. never happier. microsoft was pissing me off with the stupid "this copy is not legal" warnings ;)
[11:37] <Keyseir> dooglus, thanks
[11:37] <richy_> that is acces dienied 550*
[11:38] <SpAc> inc-inc: exactly the same
[11:38] <SpAc> can do everything I need to do with OS applications anyway
[11:38] <foreverconnected> ahh spac, you sounded like someone new to X.  I would DEFINATELY suggest setting up XGL and Beryl
[11:38] <Tarandus> hurax_: G3 Powermac. Don't know anything more now.
=== richy_ is now known as rich_
[11:38] <rich_> i have a question, i have set up my web and ftp server, but i would like to add files to my websites using ftp, but it keeps telling me acces denied, 550. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[11:38] <foreverconnected> if you're not doing anything openGL it won't conflict
[11:38] <SpAc> ok... Beryl better than Compiz?
[11:38] <rich_> can anyone help me with that?
[11:38] <foreverconnected> compiz is good for nvidia
[11:38] <hurax_> iirc the beige powermacs are old world, the greenish ones new world
[11:38] <foreverconnected> beryl is good for ati, as it works with
[11:39] <SpAc> I'm totally open to cool eye candy  :P
[11:39] <foreverconnected> fglac
[11:39] <Tarandus> hurax_: This is blue
[11:39] <dooglus> rich_: what keeps telling you "acces denied, 550" exactly?
[11:39] <foreverconnected> anyway, the website I sent you earlier
[11:39] <rich_> dooglus: sec
[11:39] <SpAc> I'm running a GeForce card
[11:39] <foreverconnected> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[11:39] <foreverconnected> in that wiki, there's a section spicifially called "eye candy"
[11:39] <hurax_> ok, so it should work theoretically
[11:39] <SpAc> so the nvidia drivers I just ran up wont cut it for Beryl?
[11:40] <inc-inc> SpAc: beryl works fine (i prefer it, much easier to use), but u need the latest 9xxx series drivers
[11:40] <rich_> dooglus: i connect using filezilla to my webserver, i see all files, but when i try to delete, or add something it says
[11:40] <rich_> oh
[11:40] <hurax_> the blue ones are new world
[11:40] <rich_> omg :S
[11:40] <rich_> it works!
[11:40] <SpAc> inc-inc: in a nutshell (and to an ex-windows user) what is it?
[11:40] <hurax_> what error do you get?
[11:40] <rich_> i guess restarting my whole server (power off) workes
[11:40] <Tarandus> hurax_: It boots the kernel if I manually enter the kernel's location and use partition 1 instead of the 2nd that's in yaboot.conf
[11:40] <rich_> yesterday evening it didnt work, and i turned it off :P now it works :P lol didnt expect, srry
[11:40] <Tarandus> hurax_: Can't open config file
[11:40] <SpAc> plus, any post install "must-do's" i need to worry about?
[11:41] <hurax_> hm
[11:41] <dooglus> rich_: that's unusual.  most web servers work better when they're turned on, but whatever works for you.
[11:41] <rich_> jeh
[11:41] <inc-inc> SpAc: its mainly eye candy, but its suprisingly useful. its got features like expose on macosx and it puts ur desktop in a cube.... just youtube for beryl and u will be wow'd
[11:41] <SpAc> oh... so Beryl is instead of Gnome?
[11:41] <rich_> me and a friend did work on it yesterday evening
[11:41] <foreverconnected> Spac: Beryl, and other xgl desktop enviroments, are basically what MS is trying to do with Vista, but better.
[11:41] <inc-inc> SpAc: Beryl sits on top of gnome (or kde)
[11:41] <rich_> i guess rebooting the whole thing updated the files?
[11:41] <foreverconnected> beryl sits on gnome
[11:42] <SpAc> ah... ok!
[11:42] <ameyer> well, if better = buggier ;)
[11:42] <noldon> need help
[11:42] <Tarandus> hurax_: it says (a long string) /@0:2,yaboot.conf: Unknown or corrupt filesystem
[11:42] <SpAc> ok... well... show me those drivers then!
[11:42] <foreverconnected> it is buggy
[11:42] <foreverconnected> yes
[11:42] <baconbacon> beryl is a replacement for metacity, not gnome
[11:42] <Tarandus> hurax_: and then comes the "Can't open config file"
[11:42] <ameyer> and actually, I think gnome sits on beryl
[11:42] <foreverconnected> the drivers you have installed right now are fine
[11:42] <dooglus> inc-inc: I youtube'd for beryl & I was wow'd by: "Searching for videos is temporarily unavailable"
[11:42] <rich_> dooglus --> pm
[11:42] <SpAc> foreverconnected: did you say Beryl was buggy?
[11:42] <dooglus> rich_: huh?
[11:42] <inc-inc> dooglus: hahaha
[11:42] <foreverconnected> Spac: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Beryl.2FAIGLX_.28Nvidia.29
[11:42] <rich_> can you look there
[11:42] <foreverconnected> just follow the guide there
[11:42] <dooglus> rich_: if you're trying to pm me you need to register with nickserv first
[11:43] <noldon> i cant chown one of my mountingpoints is to a hdd with fat32 system
[11:43] <SpAc> foreverconnected: thankyou
[11:43] <rich_> oow
[11:43] <rich_> whats the command dooglus?
[11:43] <dooglus> rich_: "/msg nickserv identify pa$$word"
[11:43] <foreverconnected> spac:I wouldent say Beryl is buggy for Nvidia users
[11:43] <foreverconnected> it works awsome for them
[11:43] <dooglus> rich_: sorry.  "/msg nickserv register pa$$word"
[11:43] <ameyer> intel users it is
[11:43] <foreverconnected> intel users and ati radeon users it is
[11:43] <rich_> oke done
[11:43] <foreverconnected> and that's not beryl's fault
[11:43] <SpAc> foreverconnected: excellent! :)
[11:44] <rich_> oh alreaddy registered :P
[11:44] <baconbacon> How should i call, in a bug report, the buttons which are an navigation "history" on top of the folder view in nautilus? What is the official name?
[11:44] <SpAc> inc-inc: why do you say you need the new drivers for beryl?
[11:44] <ameyer> but intel's drivers have been known to horribly freeze the system while playing a bideo
[11:44] <Tarandus> hurax_: Typing just "/pci@80000000/pci-bridge@d/mac-io@5/ata-3@20000/@0:1/casper/powerpc/vmlinux" it boots the kernel and then fails to find root filesystem
[11:44] <ameyer> erm, video
[11:44] <hurax_> sorry can't help you there
[11:44] <foreverconnected> it's because ati does not like to support linux, so the drivers are missing a component package that beryl needs to work nicely
[11:44] <rich_> dooglus: do you know anything about teamspeak servers?
[11:44] <foreverconnected> so you have to use the community stuff.
[11:45] <ameyer> what's intel's excise?
[11:45] <Tarandus> hurax_: Is there any homepage for the PPC Ubuntu other than the usual Ubuntu homepage?
[11:45] <ameyer> erm, excuse?
[11:45] <foreverconnected> intel should never ever make video cards again. the excuse is they suck. :P
[11:45] <ameyer> heh
[11:45] <inc-inc> beryl vids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3p8IBNNd88 and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55MKC2THMoA
[11:45] <dooglus> rich_: nope
[11:45] <foreverconnected> anyway, I'm running beryl right now. I can't do window wobble, but that's an known issue that crashes.
[11:45] <dooglus> rich_: do you know anything about DVD Recorders?
[11:45] <rich_> dooglus: k, np was just woundering or i could remove the default channel
[11:46] <ameyer> intel's driver is the problem IMO, it works ok until the computer freezes
[11:46] <SpAc> doh... need flash player for 64
[11:46] <rich_> dooglus: a little jeh
[11:46] <rich_> dooglus: why?
[11:46] <SpAc> can i get rid of all this anti-aliased text?
[11:47] <dooglus> rich_: I'm looking for a DVD Recorder with a 250GB HDD, which can play xvid and divx files and which has flashable firmware so I can update it with new codecs in the future
[11:47] <rich_> hmmm
[11:47] <foreverconnected> so nobody has any input on the samba thing?
[11:47] <dooglus> foreverconnected: are you sure you need to use samba?  I use fusesmb and it works very nicely.
[11:48] <Admiral_Chicago> foreverconnected: maybe #samba does
[11:48] <inc-inc> SpAc: im off... see ya later and goodluck
[11:48] <TLE> What the syntax of the aticonfig --hsync command, When I use it like aticonfig --hsync=Screen0,30-100 --vrefresh=Screen0,50-160 I just get an error
[11:49] <rich_> dooglus: most new dvd players can play xvid and divx files if im right, a hardisk that big is pritty tough to find i think. about the updating of new codecs you should look for a dvd recorder with a console cable entrance
[11:49] <dooglus> Admiral_Chicago: in my experience #samba tells me it's just a bug in ubuntu, and raising a bug in ubuntu's launchpad has no effect.
[11:49] <foreverconnected> yeah, I've seen the bug report in launchpad
[11:49] <dooglus> rich_: it seems very rare for a DVD recorder to have an ethernet socket.  is that what you mean?
[11:49] <Admiral_Chicago> i'm not a network guy at all, soryr i can't be of more help
[11:49] <foreverconnected>  Admiral_Chicago: people are saying it's edgy's fault
[11:50] <dooglus> rich_: here's a site that lets you search for DVD recorders: http://snipurl.com/richlookatthis - there seems to be only 1 with both a 250GB HDD and an ethernet socket.
[11:51] <rich_> dooglus: not ethernet, not the cable you put in a switch or router (or hub....), and a desktop/server. but uuh, a cable like the one you can put in your router, and your computer, and you can configure the config files and setup of the router. i believe some dvd recorders have the same, witch would mean you can download stuff to it (dont know how that works) that cable is called a console cable
[11:52] <dooglus> rich_: I don't know what you mean.  the cable between my router and my computer is a regualar (cat5?) ethernet cable
[11:53] <foreverconnected> he's talking about a COM cable
[11:53] <foreverconnected> 9 pin type or propritary that allows for direct data input to eproms and such.. am I right?
[11:53] <eilker> after installing xgl, if i decided to remove it, will i have any trouble with *.conf files ? any experience pls ?
[11:54] <foreverconnected> how did you install xgl?
[11:54] <foreverconnected> eilker: how did you install XGL?
[11:54] <foreverconnected> eilker: your best bet would be to make a seperate session for it
[11:55] <rich_> dooglus: that is correct, but it is also possible at better routers (read at routers like cisco router, so the more expencife). you can plug in a console cable in there, and in your computer. if you look at the back of your computer you can see a blue entry (not ethernet) for a plug like ur monitors (same shape). thats a console cable (so for configuring the router more than normal)
[11:55] <foreverconnected> eilker: that way, if something does not work, you can just remove it or ignore it
[11:55] <foreverconnected> rich_: did you know you can access most routers through a termnial client over cat5?
[11:55] <eilker> foreverconnected: i didnt install it yet, but i saw some notes as my video card is supported, but it has some notes as, DRI ok. scrolling is slow, workspace transitioning is choppy. eats CPU cycles. //do u suggest me install xgl?
[11:55] <rich_> dooglus:
[11:55] <rich_> ups
[11:55] <rich_> dooglus: correct
=== felixjet_ is now known as felixjet
[11:56] <rich_> dooglus: but using the console cable you can set up EVERYTHING (paths to other routers, witch route to take) and many MANY more
[11:57] <dooglus> rich_: OK, I see.
[11:57] <eilker> foreverconnected:  and is removing easy as "sudo apt-get remove etc" ? and will i have trouble with *.conf files?
[11:57] <rich_> dooglus: there are also dvd recorders that have console cable entry... if you find one of those with a hd you can upload files too it (but i dont know how that works)
[11:58] <scheuri> eilker: if you "purge" something, the conf-file will be deleted as well...if you "remove" something, those conf-files may be still on your system
[11:59] <dooglus> rich_: it just seems a bit silly to have to burn a file to a DVD just to transfer it to the DVD player's HDD.  I would expect it to have a wireless card or ethernet or some sort of other way of sharing data other than shiny plastic disks
[11:59] <eilker> scheuri: do u use xgl?
[11:59] <scheuri> eilker: no, sorry
[11:59] <AlphA_MalE> I want to run an option in .xsession only if enlightenment run...what is the right bash sintass?
[11:59] <rich_> dooglus: jep true... well for transfering movies you will need ethernet...
[12:00] <eilker> scheuri: i wanna try but scared a bit, intel onboard video card here(supported for xgl) and 512 mb ram
[12:01] <scheuri> eilker: well, I do not fancy that stuff too much...so I wait...:)...but it is up to you...but it MAY mess up your system
[12:01] <scheuri> eilker: if you are using is productiv...then you may reconsider trying
[12:01] <scheuri> but that is my own opinion
[12:01] <fatbrain> Hello, I have a T20 mp3 player, when I connect it Ubuntu recognize it as a Camera... and asks me if I want to import any photos.... is there any way I can access the t20 file-system somehow?
[12:01] <rich_> dooglus: ur sure you only found one with ethernet? even a xbox can be connected to the network...
[12:02] <eilker> scheuri: risk is charming:) i am gonna try it
[12:02] <foreverconnected> fatbrain: if it's recognising as a camera, it's probably mounting

[12:04] <rich_> dooglus: not many but there are still enough with usb, ethernet, firewire
[12:04] <Oldboy> i just never used linux but only windows
[12:04] <fatbrain> foreverconnected: nothing there... a few other crap (like my multi-card reader) and hdds/cds
[12:04] <rich_> dooglus:alot have firewire in
[12:04] <foreverconnected> oldboy: we were all new at this once, don't be discouraged. I believe those games might be windows only
[12:05] <foreverconnected> oldboy: what you have to understand is that ubuntu is Linux, and you have to get software written for linux
[12:05] <Oldboy> aha
[12:05] <rich_> oldboy: if you like playing games, dont take linux on ur computer, most games dont run or take alot of effort to make them run
[12:05] <Oldboy> then adobe won't work too ?
[12:05] <scheuri> Oldboy: and very important...reading is your new best friend in linux...:)
[12:06] <Oldboy> aha
[12:06] <foreverconnected> oldboy: there has been some success with a program called WINE and a program by a company called Transgaming to get somme games to work on linux
[12:06] <scheuri> Oldboy: the programm transgaming makes is called "cedega"...
[12:07] <foreverconnected> oldboy: but I would NOT suggest getting into those untill you are firmly understanding what linux is all about
[12:07] <fatbrain> I only play World of Warcraft, runs super on Wine.
[12:07] <Oldboy> kk i will brake my pc and get abook so i can undestand what is linux
[12:07] <rich_> hehe
[12:07] <Oldboy> thanks guys
[12:07] <rich_> your book is called www.google.nl
[12:07] <rich_> ^^
[12:07] <scheuri> Oldboy: well, not quite...:)...it is just that a lot of stuff for linux is on the net descriped and explained
[12:08] <foreverconnected> oldboy: and no, you can't use adobe. but you can use a free software called Gimp which comes installed with your Ubuntu
[12:08] <Oldboy> i enojy simplicity
[12:08] <carpediem> he's right, you can learn more from the community than books
[12:08] <foreverconnected> really? people got WoW running well in wine?
[12:08] <scheuri> Oldboy: and if it comes to games, I must admit that I agree with foreverconnected...it is not yet worth the hassle if you do not really know linux and really wand to play...:)
[12:08] <Oldboy> so i can't work and play
[12:08] <foreverconnected> holy hell
[12:08] <Oldboy> thanks
[12:08] <Oldboy> bye bye

[12:18] <Novek> ok
[12:19] <rich_> foreverconnected: oke :D
[12:19] <Novek> just gonna get it:P

[12:20] <rich_> hurax_: doesnt need nice feutures, its just for plain irc server for probebly no use :P
[12:20] <tuskernini> Novek, both

[12:27] <geokok> Anyone on how to delete totem's recently played files list?
[12:27] <hurax_> perhaps it's in universe or multiverse
[12:28] <foreverconnected> I would bet on that
[12:28] <foreverconnected> By default, Ubuntu does not enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories. But they include some important programs and codecs, so it is highly recommended to activate them. There may also be non-Ubuntu sources that you might wish to add to your Ubuntu machine.

[12:31] <hurax_> euirc seem to have a proprietary ircd
[12:31] <Novek> i see it as wireless connection yes...
[12:31] <tuskernini> and is it activated?

[12:34] <CarinArr> it doesn't manage to set up wireless properly on either of my machines when iwconfig works perfectly
[12:34] <tuskernini> Novek, do you know your ESSID?

[12:38] <CarinArr> novek, are you using dhcp?
[12:38] <Novek> yeah
[12:38] <chris_> Novek, sorry paste your iwconfig on the same paste page
[12:38] <CarinArr> chris_, he already has

[12:38] <scamboy> java is open source...yahoo!!
[12:39] <CarinArr> novek, try "iwconfig eth1 key xxxxxwhatever", "iwconfig eth1 essid youressid" "dhclient3"
[12:39] <MukiEX> GPL at that
[12:39] <chris_> no, the new one after dong iwconfig eth1 etc
[12:39] <Novek> shall there be a - every 4 number?
[12:39] <CarinArr> novek, no, without - or spaces is fine
[12:40] <sheers> people how to modifiy resolution in monitor ?
[12:40] <sheers> after of install nvidia drivers !
[12:40] <chris_> CarinArr, ok alrady at the key step..
[12:41] <CarinArr> scamboy, heh.. pass from me, got one working perfectly, one constantly running fsck when booting, one with messed up package management
[12:41] <Novek> after iwconfig eth1 key mykey i get error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : Set failed on device eth1 ; operation not permitted
[12:41] <debula> i used to have a dual boot machine! with a ubunutu and windows! now I re-installed the windows, but still the ubuntu in there! but there's no boot loader anymore! so I cant select ubuntu, how can i resolve the problem? do i need to reinstall GRUB or what?
[12:41] <Novek> shall i use sudo before the code?
[12:41] <CarinArr> yes
[12:41] <rich_> novek: sudo {previous}
[12:42] <rich_> try that?
[12:43] <Tidus> i got my dapper to upgrade to edgy without any issues
[12:43] <Ash-Fox> How does one force dpkg to continue removing something, despite the fact the fact the scripts for the package are failing?
[12:44] <CarinArr> novek, how're you getting on?
[12:45] <Novek> it's still executing dhclient3
[12:45] <CarinArr> novek, if you run iwconfig in a separate window
[12:45] <CarinArr> does it show the essid?
[12:46] <edgy__> Ash-Fox: I am also interested to know this since k3d refused to dpkg --purge for me
[12:46] <Novek> it shows essid:off/any
[12:46] <CarinArr> my one wireless card works out of box and there aren't any sort of issues at all with it.. the other one uses ndiswrapper.. and sometimes i have to set key, set essid several times before it picks up
[12:47] <CarinArr> until iwconfig shows the essid there's probably no point in trying dhclient3
[12:47] <catalytic> carinarr?

[12:47] <catalytic> heh, howdy

[12:58] <Delano> How do I install DirectX on Linux?
[12:58] <MukiEX> ROFL
[12:58] <MukiEX> Cute =P
[12:59] <Novek> is that good or bad?
[12:59] <Ash-Fox> Delano, you can install some directx support under wine.
[12:59] <Delano> How?
[12:59] <CarinArr> novek, well according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported it's a good thing
[12:59] <MukiEX> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedega ?
[12:59] <Ash-Fox> (mostly just direct3d, rest is handled by Wine)
[12:59] <CarinArr> novek, you said you were using ndiswrapper right?
[12:59] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, cedega is behind wine
[12:59] <Ash-Fox> !wine
[12:59] <ubotu> wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
[12:59] <MukiEX> Ash-Fox : really o_o
[12:59] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, yes, it's been that way for ages
[12:59] <Novek> yes
[12:59] <MukiEX> o_0
[12:59] <CarinArr> novek, do you know which .inf file you used?
[01:00] <MukiEX> So then what's Cedega's purpose save for maybe Cider?
[01:00] <Novek> bcmwl5.inf
[01:00] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, to take money
[01:00] <CarinArr> novek, i'm not sure if there'll be any difference, but the page just mentioned recommends bcmwl5a.inf
[01:00] <MukiEX> Ash-Fox : I'm not sure why (maybe it's the lack of a .wine folder), but wine gives me a bunch of unhandled page faults when I try to run it in Edgy on a fresh install.
[01:01] <MukiEX> The cause seems to be x11drv_main
[01:01] <MukiEX> Is this an fglrx thing?
[01:01] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, glxinfo |grep direct
[01:01] <CarinArr> novek, i'm clutching at straws here.. you can keep trying to set key and essid using iwconfig a few times sometimes it doesn't pick up the first time.. but when my wireless cards don't pick up they at least show networks available when doing iwlist scan
[01:01] <MukiEX> direct rendering: yes
[01:01] <CarinArr> novek, or you can try and see if using bcmwl5a.inf in ndiswrapper would make a difference
[01:01] <Novek> so i should switch driver?
[01:02] <MukiEX> I meant, is the latest fglrx foobaring wine?
[01:02] <CarinArr> novek, again, i'm not sure it will solve it, i'm telling you what my next steps would be
[01:02] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, doubt it
[01:02] <Tarandus> Does oldworld mean no openfirmware, and newworld means it does have openfirmware?
[01:02] <Ash-Fox> Are you using the 'deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt edgy main' repository?
[01:02] <Novek> so i should remove bcmwl5 and insert bcmwl5a?
[01:03] <MukiEX> I think I'm just using the standard Edgy repository.
[01:03] <MukiEX> Should I add that?
[01:03] <CarinArr> novek, yeah try that, see if it makes a difference
[01:03] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, yeah, add the one on http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
[01:03] <Novek> I'll see if i have that driver.. bcmwl5a.inf
[01:03] <CarinArr> teaching. will be back in a bit
[01:04] <MukiEX> Ash-Fox : Woah, I already added that one o_0 Most recent addition to my sources.list too.
[01:04] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX, well, there was a update to wine I didn't test today... let me see if it works
[01:04] <we2by> hi guys

[01:05] <juanjo_21> hola, alguien que porfavor me pueda ayudar?
[01:05] <MukiEX> That's odd... The only forum post I could find, with the exact same problem, didn't seem to have a solution.
[01:06] <Ash-Fox> MukiEX does 'wine winecfg' work?
[01:06] <MukiEX> brb, there's one thing I can do to test.
[01:06] <MukiEX> nope, same problem
[01:06] <Ash-Fox> hmm... could you try doing a rm -rf ~/.wine ?
[01:07] <southestia> hi all

[01:41] <TLE> In general it should be possible to convert from pixelbased to vector based graphics format but you will just not utilize the adcantages of the particular format very well

[01:45] <dxdemetriou> nolimitsoya, I found the solution. is offset=offset=307200, mount -o loop,offset=307200 imagen.nrg /path/mount_directory :)
[01:45] <catalytic> can anyone help me here with dual screen
[01:45] <catalytic> ati
[01:45] <catalytic> using big view
[01:45] <catalytic> it knows the screen is there, i can move the mouse into it in the GDM login page
[01:46] <pfhomer> dooglus apps. I only have 128 MB of RAM, and there is a lot of swapping. Assuming I have very little disk access once my apps are loaded, I want maximum responsiveness when switching between apps
[01:46] <catalytic> but once it logs in, the right screen (1) goes white, and I can move the mouse into it
[01:46] <dooglus> pfhomer: that should happen automatically, but there is a parameter called 'swapiness' you can set if you want the kernel to tend to be less swap-y
[01:46] <TLE> catalytic: Did you use aticonfig to configure your xorg ?
[01:46] <pfhomer> dooglus yeah, but will that affect disk cache as well?
[01:46] <catalytic> yes
[01:47] <catalytic> first
[01:47] <dorel__> thats so odd how i cant hear music from pandora.com on firefox...
[01:47] <catalytic> im running off the first page of this
[01:47] <catalytic> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174
[01:47] <catalytic> im using mergedFB
[01:48] <dooglus> pfhomer: yes it will
[01:48] <dooglus> pfhomer: To tune, simply echo a value from 0 to 100 onto /proc/sys/vm/swappiness. The higher a number set here, the more the system will swap.
[01:49] <dooglus> pfhomer: read about it here: http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000
[01:49] <Trackilizer> catalytic, could be that your monitors are on the wrong side of eachother, if you know what i mean. I had the same problem, try moving your mouse onto monitor 1 by moving your mouse into the opposite side of monitor 1 on monitor 2... hope this made atleast some sense
[01:49] <pfhomer> dooglus thanks
[01:49] <catalytic> nope its not that
[01:49] <TLE> catalytic: ... reading ...
[01:49] <catalytic> already swapped them over
[01:50] <soundray> I need help troubleshooting ssh-agent please. ssh-add seems to work -- no errors. But when I ssh, the key doesn't get used. ??
[01:50] <catalytic> i just read the bit how MergedFB works, tricking Xorg into thinking u have only one screen
[01:50] <catalytic> I think that part is working, but the resolution is still limited to one screen, as if the virtual resolution that I put into the Xorg.conf is not getting picked up
[01:50] <catalytic> or ive put it in wrong
[01:52] <catalytic> http://pastebin.com/824069
[01:52] <catalytic> er
[01:53] <catalytic> i did put it in wrong
[01:53] <catalytic> the virtual shouldnt be
[01:53] <catalytic> Virtual 2048 768
[01:53] <Acke_ubu> hey In which file are my my user passwords?
[01:53] <catalytic> its should 2560 1024

[01:54] <Julez83> Has anyone a link to a site describing how to re-install GRUB? I'm stuck at the "STAGE 1.5 LOADING GRUB", and can't run neither Windows or Ubuntu from HDD. Have to run Ubuntu from Live-CD.
[01:54] <soundray> Acke_ubu: /etc/shadow (hashed)
[01:54] <Acke_ubu> Sonderblade, thanks
[01:54] <pfhomer> Do you guys rock?
[01:54] <Sonderblade> Acke_ubu: your welcome
[01:55] <soundray> !grub | Julez83

[01:55] <trig> hi, can anybody help me? I can't initialize my computer. During initialization it stops on: Waiting for root file system
[01:55] <Acke_ubu> so sudo john /etc/shadow
[01:55] <djay-il> hello
[01:55] <Acke_ubu> it is
[01:56] <Julez83> ta
[01:56] <soundray> Julez83: you can probably follow the Recovering... instructions
[01:56] <nolimitsoya> trig, have you messed up your fstab, or moved any drives?
[01:56] <Julez83> KK, will check it out
[01:56] <mixandgo> anyone managed to get Photoshop 8 running on Ubuntu ?
[01:56] <soundray> Julez83: ta? You must be British
[01:56] <djay-il> I have couple of specific questions about ubuntu, who could answer then?
[01:57] <djay-il> non techical ones
[01:57] <Julez83> No, just play way too much on english servers and with ventrilo. :P
[01:57] <soundray> Acke_ubu: no, 'sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep john'
[01:57] <dooglus> soundray: or sudo grep john /etc/shadow ?
[01:57] <Acke_ubu> soundray, hehe yes if i want to find user john. but not if i want to rip shadow with john
[01:58] <Acke_ubu> right?!
[01:58] <soundray> Acke_ubu: sorry, I've never heard of that kind of john ;)
[01:58] <Acke_ubu> soundray, :)

[01:59] <djay-il> ok, lets try this: who could help me with www.ubuntu.com/employment?
[01:59] <pfhomer> Anyone use bitchX?
[01:59] <trig> nolimitsoya: I haven't messed with fstab or drives, just had a problem while upgrading from hoary to dapper
[02:00] <felixjet> when i click on the ubuntu menu, the menus with lot of submenus, appears limited in size, with an arrow at top and bottom, how i can make that menus show at 100% ? without care of how much height they need
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> djay-il, if you need help applying you proably wont get a job ;)
[02:00] <dooglus> pfhomer: I think irssi is more common these days as console IRC clients go
[02:00] <pfhomer> dooglus ok
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> trig, then rebuild you fstab, tobegin with
[02:00] <pfhomer> dooglus it uses more memory, though
[02:00] <ESPOiG> i have installed java from the repos and from a self extracting java install, yet it still asks wen i try to run a program /bin/java ??
[02:00] <nolimitsoya> trig, or do a fresh reinstall, hozing /, but keeping /home
[02:00] <kuja> weechat isn't a bad console IRC client either :)
[02:00] <djay-il> nolimitsoya: no, I don't help applying, I wanted to get more details
[02:01] <djay-il> dont need*
[02:01] <pfhomer> kuja I want something that can have each channel in a "fullscreen window", only one "window"/channel visible at a time, and then lets be switch between channels/windows with a keypress
[02:01] <nolimitsoya> djay-il, id suggest sending an email :)
[02:01] <trig> nolimitsoya: before reinstaling I want to try other things, because it is not only a matter of the /home directory but the databases and the whole configuration :P
[02:01] <kuja> pfhomer: Weechat and irssi both do that
[02:01] <djay-il> so, I can ask them general questions there? its not just for applying and stuff?
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> trig, then rebuild your fstab
[02:02] <pfhomer> kuja ok
[02:02] <TLE> catalytic: Ok that's is a significantly more complicated approach that the one I use but it seem better. I don't think I can help you, so ask your wuestion again and include the HOWTO link in the question
[02:02] <kuja> pfhomer: The good thing about weechat is, it comes with a userlist on the side
[02:02] <dooglus> pfhomer: I'm using irssi to do that at the moment.  control-n and control-p go to the 'next' and 'previous' channels
[02:02] <trig> nolimitsoya: and  I don't think it is a problem of fstab but something relating to the initialization.. related to the initramfs and so
[02:02] <pfhomer> dooglus ok
[02:02] <visik7> I've a laptop with an ethernet and a wlan bot work now I want to route the http traffic through  ethernet and the rest through wireless
[02:02] <visik7> is there a solution ?
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> djay-il, a wild guess is that email adress is that of their recruiting staff.they should be able to give you a nudge in the righ direction, at least
[02:02] <djay-il> nolimitsoya: ok, thanks
[02:03] <trig> at the moment I'm stuck in the BusyBox shell
[02:04] <nolimitsoya> trig, try a chroot from a live environment, and redo the upgrade, or apt-get install -f
[02:04] <pfhomer> kuja woah, weechat uses even more memory than mighty xchat, which I might as well use, then
[02:04] <soundray> visik7: I don't think this is possible without serious kernel hacking. But maybe you can achieve the effect you desire with QoS/traffic shaping
[02:05] <Acke_ubu> hey where are windows xp passwords stored?
[02:05] <kuja> What does that have to do with Ubuntu?
[02:05] <kuja> Ask ##windows
[02:05] <soundray> Acke_ubu: not in the ubuntu channel ;)
[02:05] <Acke_ubu> soundray, :P
[02:06] <visik7> soundray: I've tried with tc and ip but I can handle only forward packets not the one generated by me
[02:06] <pfhomer> kuja oh sorry, I was wrong.
[02:06] <kuja> pfhomer: It's a ncruses client, I would certainly hope it doesn't require more memory.
[02:06] <trig> nolimitsoya: I would rather prefer to reinstall than to reupgrade... heh. it was a bit hard... I just want to know if someone knows about my problem, because I have read a lot about a very similar error, that can be solved just by typing 2 commands
[02:07] <Novek> ok... i'm wondering if i shall install my broadcom with ndis or fwcutter? anyone know this problem`?
[02:07] <pfhomer> kuja how do I switch between channels/windows?
[02:07] <trig> nolimitsoya: but it isn't valid for me
[02:07] <kuja> pfhomer: Read the documentation on their website.
[02:08] <pfhomer> kuja I'd rather ask you :)
[02:08] <kuja> I'd rather not give you a fish, but learn to fish.
[02:08] <pfhomer> kuja sigh
[02:08] <Novek> what is best... fwcutter or ndiswrapper?
[02:09] <soundray> visik7: have you tried with virtual interfaces (eth:0, eth:1) ?
[02:09] <pfhomer> kuja I know how to fish, I know how to read docs, I just want to know how to switch channels. I am not going to get any wiser or better by reading it in the docs...
[02:09] <thevenin> lol
[02:09] <visik7> soundray: and than ?
[02:09] <kuja> pfhomer: For thinking that, you are unwise.
[02:10] <pfhomer> kuja: Not at all
[02:10] <visik7> soundray: and then ?
[02:10] <pfhomer> kuja: I am not asking you to look it up for me. I am just asking you to tell me if you already know. All questions in this channel can be answered by "read the documentation"
[02:11] <soundray> visik7: route your own traffic somehow. Sorry, I'm no expert. Just something that came to mind.
[02:12] <trig> nolimitsoya: thanks by the way ;9

[02:21] <fyrestrtr> chandoo: do you have a /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to your kernel source?
[02:21] <compengi> dooglus, ?
[02:21] <chandoo> fyrestrtr: yes i do
[02:22] <fyrestrtr> chandoo: are you running your new kernel?

[02:22] <Dobs> Installed all possible w32codecs + all divx+xvid for mplayer and VLC .. including mozilla plugin for mplayer .. when i go play any video file .. be it WMV or AVI .. i get sound but a black screen
[02:22] <Dobs> please help
[02:23] <fyrestrtr> Dobs: what video card do you have?
[02:23] <Dobs> fyrestrtr: ATI Radeon 9700
[02:23] <fyrestrtr> are you running xgl?
[02:23] <Dobs> fyrestrtr: drivers are working nice
[02:23] <Dobs> fyrestrtr: not sure i know what it is?
[02:23] <fyrestrtr> then you aren't.
[02:23] <Dobs> fyrestrtr: can u gimme a link or run me through what to do?
[02:23] <nickthorley> hi all - i would like to try ubuntu server on an old relatively low spec mac - hence i have decided on xubuntu but am thinking i would be better sticking to the 6.06 long time support version instead of the new edgy version - do you think this is best
[02:24] <fyrestrtr> what happens when you type (at a command prompt) mplayer somefile.avi ? What output do you get?
[02:24] <pfhomer> 3D
[02:24] <pfhomer> 3C
[02:24] <chandoo> fyrestrtr: in /lib/modules/2.6.18.2Chandra/source has sym link to source -> /usr/src/linux-2.6.18.2
[02:24] <Laosboyme> try 6.10
[02:24] <Dobs> fyrestrtr: i get all the standard mplayer text .. the window opens and it starts the movie .. screen is black sound is through
[02:24] <Laosboyme> how to mount 4 in 1 sd card please help me
[02:24] <nickthorley> laosboyme: was that directed at me?
[02:24] <fyrestrtr> chandoo: it should be /usr/src/linux is symlink pointing to /usr/src/linux-2.6.18.2
[02:24] <dooglus> Dobs: what if you do "mplayer -vo x11 movie.avi"?
[02:25] <Dobs> dooglus: on my way to try as we speak
[02:25] <chandoo> fyrestrtr: this sym link is created when i installed kernel
[02:25] <chandoo> do you want me to try with linux
[02:25] <Dobs> dooglus: works perfectly! how do i get this in mozilla?
[02:26] <fyrestrtr> is there a reason why you have a custom kernel?
[02:26] <chandoo> but nvidia driver is following the symlink and it says that kernel-rpm is not installed pls install it
[02:26] <Laosboyme> i think so
[02:26] <dooglus> Dobs: maybe by adding a line saying "vo=x11" to ~/.mplayer/config
[02:26] <MetaBookfoziS> lol!! I'm booted my windows rather far so i'm forget my apsswd:D i'm can't login to win, under linux, how can i restore my winxp password?

[02:27] <thevenin> Laosboyme: depends on what GUI you like
[02:28] <fyrestrtr> Laosboyme: is the same system underneath, just the desktop manager is different.
[02:28] <nolimitsoya> Laosboyme, matter of taste
[02:28] <chandoo> fyrestrtr: i downloaded the latest kernel and just did my way , how is use to do every time.

[02:34] <stjepan> I'm bored... I want to start programming something... (nothing big) any wishes, recommendations? :)
[02:34] <dooglus> Dobs: just add a line saying "vo=x11" without the quotes
[02:34] <chandoo> fyrestrtr: thanks
[02:34] <fyrestrtr> stjepan: go to sourceforge.net and find a project you like.
[02:35] <BooBar> nolimitsoya: where do i remover the old nvidia driveres and module
[02:35] <stjepan> fyrestrtr, I want something new, my :|
[02:35] <nolimitsoya> BooBar, sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx
[02:35] <Allz> i did this i console -> # ./ventrilo_srv and i get /usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libstdc++.so.3" not found, required by "ventrilo_srv"
[02:35] <Allz> someo0ne help me plzzz :(
[02:36] <zach634> Allz, i had that same problem
[02:36] <dooglus> Allz: which version of ubuntu are you using?
[02:36] <zach634> Allz: do sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:37] <KenSentMe> Anyone here succesfully using the Lives video editor?
[02:37] <Dobs> that's working now, thank you for that .. now when i'm in the movie using mplayer .. how would i be able to fast forward or back .. i just realised the arrow keys exit the program :S
[02:37] <BooBar> nolimitsoya: i did that but when the nvidia driver installs it also compiles a kernel modual which sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx does not remove
[02:37] <dooglus> Dobs: I use the arrow keys
[02:37] <dooglus> Dobs: is it a short movie?  mplayer exits at the end of the movie.
[02:37] <nolimitsoya> BooBar, why not just reinstall it, with the right kernel headers? then your problems would be fixed
[02:37] <Laosboyme> can't mount 4 in 1 sd card
[02:37] <dooglus> Dobs: does the left arrow at leave take you back to the start?
[02:38] <e319> here is my next question since i know nothing about hardware. my brother in law is building me a pc with sata drives. he sent me this link: http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html and says that he cannot get it to work with ubuntu ... that linux doesnt support it off that bat, do i need to rebuild the kernel?
[02:38] <zach634> Allz: then if it doesnt work after that, you can find libstdc++.so.3 somewhere online and build it yourself
[02:38] <Laosboyme> does anybody know how to?
[02:38] <charlie5> fyrestrtr: sorry ... i have a script which uses grep ... i guess i need to replace grep with pcregrep in the script ?
[02:38] <Dobs> dooglus, exits the app immediately .. (no, it's a 2 hour divx) .. any key exited the app straight away
[02:38] <Dobs> dooglus, how bout if i used the gui mplayer with the same commands? will work?
[02:38] <BooBar> i have thats how iam useing the box now but if i restart my box i have to install the drivere again #
[02:38] <Allz> zach634 freeBSD apt-get ?
[02:38] <Allz> :S
[02:38] <dooglus> Dobs: I use 'mplayer-nogui' - haven't really tried the gui versions much at all
[02:38] <fyrestrtr> charlie5: I guess so :)
[02:39] <dooglus> Dobs: do you see any message in the terminal about why it's exiting?
[02:39] <zach634> Allz: freeBSD?  schwat?
[02:39] <Dobs> ok dooglus, appreciate your help .. that's enough for today, don't wanna push ur patience ..
[02:39] <Allz> i am on bsd
[02:39] <Dobs> i'll come back next time i'm stuck .. now i can watch a movie .. thank u
[02:39] <zach634> then why are you on #ubuntu?
[02:39] <Allz> :S
[02:39] <nolimitsoya> e319, you should get the person with the problem on here, or noone is going to be able to offer much help
[02:39] <Allz> sorry
[02:39] <zach634> lol
[02:40] <e319> nolimitsoya: ok -
[02:40] <charlie5> fyrestrtr: :) ... maybe it would be easier for me to alias or link   grep   as   pcegrep
[02:40] <Laosboyme> who needs ip1000 pixma driver!
[02:40] <zach634> Allz, well, you still need all that nice build stuff, gcc and the like
[02:40] <Laosboyme> just im me
[02:40] <grout> where can i find a list of ubuntu compatable wifi cards?
[02:40] <zach634> Allz: so find libstdc++.so.3 online and use ./configure and stuff
[02:40] <e319> nolimitsoya: he says that Serial ATA (SATA) chipsets are not supported ...
[02:41] <nolimitsoya> !wifi | grout
[02:41] <ubotu> grout: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:41] <BooBar> nolimitsoya:  i have installed again thats how iam useing the box now. But if i restart my box i have to install the driver again because the module is left behind
[02:41] <nolimitsoya> e319, and he is wrong
[02:41] <zach634> e319: nolimitsoya be correct
[02:41] <nolimitsoya> BooBar, apt get the right headers for your kernel, and compile with gcc4, if you are on edgy, or 3.4 if you are on dapper
[02:42] <zach634> e319: unless you have some odd mobo, most sata controllers should be good to go
[02:42] <e319> zach634: ty, let me see what logicboard he ourchased -
[02:43] <zach634> NF4 sata controllers ought to be supported, that's what I use
[02:43] <nolimitsoya> !sate | e319
[02:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sate - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:43] <nolimitsoya> !sata | e319
[02:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sata - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:43] <nolimitsoya> hm...
[02:43] <Doow> !ggl sata linux
[02:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ggl sata linux - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:43] <e319> he said that when he installed, the error had "huh?" in it :P
[02:43] <Doow> bah
[02:43] <compengi> had anyone used transcode before?
[02:44] <e319> going to get the error msgs shortly -
[02:44] <BooBar> nolimitsoya: I dont know how.  Isnt there a way that i can just delete all the nvidia modules and drivers,
[02:44] <nolimitsoya> e319, please, get him in here. troubleshooting is hard enough without having to do so by proxy
[02:45] <BooBar> nolimitsoya: where are the kernel modules kept
[02:46] <zach634> got a general question, should source code compile and work on any architecture?
[02:46] <nolimitsoya> zach634, no, not universaly
[02:47] <zach634> dang, I keep having trouble with stuff on my old iBook
[02:47] <nolimitsoya> zach634, well, ppc shouldnt be a problem :)
[02:47] <dooglus> BooBar: /lib/modules/<version>/
[02:47] <zach634> and i tell ya, dangit!  include build-essential with ubuntu standard!
[02:47] <zach634> it's so...  essential!
[02:48] <Doow> zach634, not on every architecture, but it's much easier to get the program running on architectures it wasn't originally intended for if you have the source code
[02:48] <dooglus> zach634: it's only essential for building stuff though...
[02:48] <Drac|School> dooglus: Building stuff is pretty essential to any healthy linux machine.
[02:48] <zach634> but when you dont know that it isnt installed, it's havok
[02:48] <zach634> expecially with a new user <-
[02:49] <Doow> Drac|School, not the one I just installed for my mother, she really has no use for building stuff at all.
[02:49] <nolimitsoya> zach634, yes, but new users arent usualy building their apps from source ;)
[02:49] <nolimitsoya> zach634, just apt-get it :)
=== Allz is now known as ellarrr
[02:49] <zach634> indeed they arent, but when these OSX books can build packages that Ubuntu cant...  something is up
[02:50] <zach634> and you cant tell me Ubuntu is MORE user-oriented than OSX
[02:50] <tuskernini> what do i need to have installed ti build apps from source?
[02:51] <zach634> tuskernini: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:51] <tuskernini> i did that once... did not seem to work... will do again thanx
[02:51] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, zach634, make sure the right headers are installed. sometimes it draws in 386 instead of generic
[02:51] <SlimG> I get "aclocal: Command not found" while trying to compile 1st time in kdevelop, what ubuntu package do i need?
[02:52] <zach634> tuskernini: well, you know how to install after that right?
[02:52] <nolimitsoya> zach634, adapt that to your ppc ;)
[02:52] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya, how do i do that---
[02:52] <Doow> what exactly is build-essential, a package that tells me what I need to have installed if I want to compile various ubuntu packages from source?
[02:52] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, search forthe kernelheaders, and uninstall if 386 is installed, installing -generic
[02:52] <tuskernini> zach634, not sure what you mean... make sudo make_
[02:52] <Doow> the description was a little confusing
[02:52] <nolimitsoya> Doow, compilers and headers
[02:52] <nolimitsoya> Doow, in short, everything you need to compile :)
[02:53] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya, with synaptic?
[02:53] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, yes
[02:53] <poulap> what burning software is similar to nero?
[02:53] <nolimitsoya> poulap, k3b is widely regarded as the most complete burning app for linux
[02:54] <Doow> nolimitsoya, ok, so it has dependencies on g++ and such? cause from the description it looked like it only listed what packages was needed
[02:54] <immesys> how do I set up network authentication?
[02:54] <nolimitsoya> Doow, it is dependant on every package you need
[02:54] <poulap> thanks nolimitsoya
[02:54] <nolimitsoya> Doow, the package it self is just a dummy
[02:54] <zach634> got another generic question...  can I build an app to a USB drive, then use that without having to ./configure + etc it again?
[02:54] <Doow> ah, ok
[02:55] <bayzider> Hey I need some help with files. Say the file says last eddited on today how do I change that?
[02:55] <phanter> hi there. I use spaces in my folder names. I wrote a script to change the ownership of files, but it gives errors on the spaces (it does not see the name as 1 name, but as multiple arguments). How can I solve this ?
[02:55] <Doow> nolimitsoya, maybe that's why I had such problems getting anjuta working correctly
[02:55] <zach634> phanter: use '\ ' for a space
[02:55] <phanter> bayzider: change the clock and edit it again ;)
[02:55] <nolimitsoya> zach634, is you build i program its then binary.
[02:55] <zach634> phanter: as in /Folder\ With\ Spaces/
[02:55] <nolimitsoya> *a
[02:55] <immesys> bayzider, your could change the date with 'date' and 'touch' it
[02:55] <Doow> nolimitsoya, I tried to install g++ and everything explicitly, which didn't work very well
[02:56] <nolimitsoya> Doow, just sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:56] <lupine_home> or "Folder with spaces" also works
[02:56] <phanter> zach634: I tried it, but that does not work
[02:56] <Doow> nolimitsoya, yeah, I'll give it a try
[02:56] <bayzider> phanter: So I just got and change the date to sya yesterday open the file change it save it then put the clock back and there would be no trace that I did it?
[02:56] <zach634> phanter: odd...
[02:56] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya, i have 0 headers installed
[02:56] <immesys> how do I set up a network so that usernames and stuff are redirected to a server for authentication?
[02:57] <zach634> bayzider: this may not be related, but make sure your clock in the bios is set properly
[02:57] <phanter> bayzider: i think so :), but I think you have to make a new file after changing the clock and not just edit it
[02:57] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, then sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-headers-`uname -r`
[02:57] <phanter> oke, I also tried the "xxx" option, but Bash still gives me the same error
[02:57] <lupine_home> bayzider: except for you asking about how to do it here, no ;)
[02:57] <phanter> the line llooks like: Target=$MPF"Pictures/Feest\ bij\ Niels\ op\ Dinsdag"
[02:57] <zach634> phanter: i think lupine was right, you could probably also use "/Folder With Spaces/stuff/"
[02:58] <zach634> phanter
[02:58] <phanter> I also tried: Target=$MPF"Pictures/Feest bij Niels op Dinsdag"
[02:58] <zach634> Ah
[02:58] <lupine_home> get rid of the / in quotes
[02:58] <lupine_home> erm, \ ratehr
[02:58] <phanter> zach634: I tried it , but with minimal result
[02:58] <zach634> phanter: yes, get rid of \ in quotes, and make sure to end folders with a /
[02:58] <Julez83> !grub
[02:58] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:58] <Doow> nolimitsoya, Mwahahahahha, it worked!
[02:58] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya, could not find the appropriate headers... probably repo problems
[02:59] <Doow> nolimitsoya, thanks =)
[02:59] <zach634> brb, class is over
[02:59] <bayzider> panter: So say I have a file that im not supposed to touch but I did, and I want to erase any trace that I did theres no app I can download to edit the metadata?
[02:59] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, did you copy and paste, or type? try copy and paste. its important to get the `` gight
[02:59] <nolimitsoya> *right
[02:59] <phanter> zach634: lupine_home : I tried both you ideas but it does not change. Could it be because I add the folder think behind a variable (that contains the first part of the folder)?
[02:59] <nolimitsoya> Doow, yw gl hf
[03:00] <poulap> k3b does not seem to want to burn an iso stored on my network
[03:00] <tuskernini> i did copy and paste... will do again
[03:00] <lupine_home> erm, yeah - possibly. Are there spaces in the variable?
[03:00] <nolimitsoya> poulap, turn off/on caching
[03:00] <lupine_home> erm, in the value stored in the variable
[03:00] <foxpaul> hi all - does anyone know if edgy will support gnome power manager will sleep on my laptop?
[03:00] <phanter> bayzider: if there is a file you should not touch... then don't touch it :), but I am not aware of any metadata editor... maybe google will help
[03:00] <poulap> is that in the k3b?
[03:00] <Doow> nolimitsoya, now I'll just have to figure out if I like Anjuta  when it's working properly
[03:00] <phanter> lupine_home: no spaces int he variable
[03:01] <phanter> i can paste the script if you like
[03:01] <bayzider> phanter: Thanks for the help, I forgot the #1 rule google it =\
[03:01] <lupine_home> hmm. Well, you can put the variable inside the quotes anyway
[03:01] <immesys> bayzider, you can change metadata in windows files.. so maybe linux as well
[03:01] <lupine_home> that might fix iy
[03:01] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya,  Couldn't find package kernel-headers-2.6.17-10-generic
[03:01] <lupine_home> it*
[03:01] <lupine_home> tuskernini: linux-headers
[03:01] <tuskernini> will try to add repos
[03:01] <bayzider> Kay question number 2, what are the advantages of egdy vs 6.06
[03:01] <lupine_home>  not kernel-headers
[03:01] <immesys> bayzider, edgy crashes more often :-S
[03:01] <tuskernini> aha.. ok
[03:01] <nolimitsoya> tuskernini, yes, should be linux-headers... sorry
[03:01] <lupine_home> no it doesn't! :D
[03:02] <lupine_home> edgy is perfectly stable
[03:02] <bayzider> immesys: so how is it better?
[03:02] <tuskernini> nolimitsoya, ok 30megs downloading... ta
[03:02] <foxpaul> anyone have any ideas how well edgy will run on my sony vaio FE28h?
[03:02] <immesys> edgy has a new init, it comes with better apps, and overall better... its newer... so hey
[03:02] <apokryphos> wilman: yes; see packages.ubuntu.com
[03:03] <bayzider> Is worth re downlaoding all my shit just 2 have the new distro?
[03:03] <lupine_home> edgy is more experimental in some areas (like using upstart rather than sysvinit), but I wouldn't use it on a server /just in case/
[03:03] <lupine_home> for desktop use, it's perfect
[03:03] <apokryphos> bayzider: you can upgrade to edgy
[03:03] <immesys> @bayzider not in my opinion
[03:03] <lupine_home> bayzider: you can upgrade...
[03:03] <bayzider> How O_O
[03:03] <apokryphos> very easily
[03:03] <apokryphos> bayzider: see the topic
[03:03] <immesys> but upgrading is like 700MB anyway... and some people report that it messes with their apps

[03:07] <apokryphos> bayzider: which means Frequently Asked Questions
[03:07] <dooglus> I have a 5MB .csv file - what's a good viewer for it?  I tried gnumeric, but the process grew to 250MB and locked up the PC
[03:07] <bayzider> thanks
[03:07] <apokryphos> the majority of your questions/answers will be there
[03:07] <fyrestrtr> dooglus: perl?
[03:07] <Scot1> anyone know how to make iomega usb drive not read only
[03:07] <fyrestrtr> Scot1: is it formatted ntfs?
[03:07] <S3> l
[03:07] <Scot1> may be
[03:08] <fyrestrtr> probably is, because by default ntfs is read-only in ubuntu.
[03:08] <fyrestrtr> !ntfs
[03:08] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[03:08] <fyrestrtr> !fuse
[03:08] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[03:08] <CPrgmSwR2> I final,y setup a duel boot between gentoo and ubuntu
[03:08] <phanter> damn... firefox crashed (on winxp of curse)
[03:08] <bayzider> I dont see any think on dapper to edgy. theres up grads just not dapper to egdy
[03:08] <dooglus> !ntfs-3g
[03:08] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[03:08] <fyrestrtr> !upgrade

[03:08] <S3> anyone know anything about getting evolution to work with M$ Exchange?
[03:09] <CPrgmSwR2> you have to modify a config file to upgrade from dapper to edgy
[03:09] <bayzider> =)_
[03:09] <bayzider> thanks found it
[03:09] <fyrestrtr> S3: get the connector.
[03:09] <Julez83> Ello all! Still having some troubles with the grub startup. Read that since i use hda for win and hdb for ubuntu, i should sudo grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/hdb. But i only get "Could not find device for /boot/boot: Not found or not a block device."
[03:09] <samu> How do you setup programs to auto-start at login?
[03:09] <apokryphos> CPrgmSwR2: or just a command. Best to recommend the guide
[03:09] <dooglus> S3: you need to install the "evolution-exchange" (believe it or not!) package...
[03:09] <immesys> how do I set up a network so that users can log in to all the pc's with same password?
[03:09] <CPrgmSwR2> the command supplied did not work
[03:09] <dooglus> samu: login or boot?
[03:10] <phanter> my script is still not working. I paste it here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31669/ maybe somebody would like to have a look with me why it is not working as planned
[03:10] <apokryphos> CPrgmSwR2: if you followed the instructions everything would work perfectly fine
[03:10] <S3> the 2.8 release with edgy still needs a connector?
[03:10] <Scot1> thanks it is ntfs. now gotta figure out how to format it
[03:10] <SlimG> what ubuntu package contains aclocal? kdevelop says it's missing
[03:10] <dooglus> S3: oh, I don't know, sorry.  I'm still using 2.6.3
[03:10] <samu> dooglus, login. gnome.
[03:10] <Laosboyme> weeeeeeeeeeE!
=== sudharsh is now known as Sup3rkiddo
[03:11] <Laosboyme> how to change password guys
[03:11] <lupine_85> SlimG: gnome-doc-utils
[03:11] <Laosboyme> lol
[03:11] <lupine_85> "passwd new-passwd"
[03:11] <soundray> Julez83: what you've read is wrong IMO. Where are you running grub-install -- from a live CD?
[03:11] <CPrgmSwR2> autoconf contals aclocal I believe
[03:11] <S3> I'll take a look at the connector anyhow, hopefully that will help.

[03:14] <bayzider> Any one know?
[03:14] <phanter> dooglus: jrib: thanks guys, you saved my day :), it works !
[03:14] <soundray> Julez83: /dev/hdb?  Is your drive not partitioned?
[03:14] <jrib> phanter: yeah, that's one thing I don't like about bash...
[03:14] <samu> dooglus, isn't there some program inside gnome for setting it up?
[03:14] <S3> Apparently I already have evolution-exchange installed. Does evolution expect the exchange OQA to be on the default port?

[03:15] <dooglus> samu: you can look at the gnome sessions dialog if you like, but it's pretty crap in my experience.  and if you switch to kde or xfce4, gnome sessions will stop working, but ~/.xprofile will keep working.
[03:15] <phanter> jrib: I thought is was enough to put it like that into the variable
[03:15] <nuts7> jrib: I just have to rename universe to multiverse?
[03:15] <tom47_> immesys try this google "ubuntu authentication server"
[03:15] <jrib> phanter: yeah, not with bash.  Give zsh a try
[03:15] <Julez83> soundray:One partition on hdd in pri1 (win C:\) and one for pri2 (ext3 linux)? Or does it want the partition-number too?
[03:15] <dooglus> phanter: variables are expanded and then the line is split according to white space
[03:16] <jrib> nuts7: nah, add " multiverse" to the end
[03:16] <immesys> tom47: I'll look again but I've lost faith in google
[03:16] <phanter> i see thanks
[03:16] <dooglus> phanter: so you need to quote any variable which might have spaces in it if you don't want the value to be used as separate arguments

[03:16] <xamox> I changed the group my default user was in and now ubuntu is saying that user is no longer a sudoer. How can I get this user back into that group?
[03:16] <dooglus> phanter: try something like:   x="a b"; ls $x   and compare with:   x="a b"; ls "$x"
[03:17] <jrib> xamox: add him to the 'admin' group

[03:17] <samu> dooglus, ok, so how can i find out exactly what command is used to run a program when clicking an icon in my menus
[03:17] <dooglus> xamox: use a different sudoer's account and run "sudo adduser <youruser> admin"
[03:17] <xamox> how can I if I don't have sudo access?
[03:17] <soundray> Julez83: tell me which partition your /boot directory is in. /dev/hdb1?
[03:17] <nuts7> jrib: thanx big time, it worx =)
[03:17] <xamox> there is no root in ubuntu, correct?
[03:17] <thefish> xamox: you will need to boot into single user mode i think
[03:17] <Julez83> one sec
[03:17] <jrib> xamox: reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then issue 'adduser your_username admin'
[03:18] <dooglus> samu: I don't know, sorry.  maybe using the menu editor?
[03:18] <xamox> jrib:  alright, thx.

[03:18] <eneried> hello everybody. Does anybody know where to download dvd images of ubuntu repositories?
[03:18] <bayzider> When I try and upgrade from dapper to edgy im geting this error ( http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31670/ ) what do I do?
[03:18] <nuts7> jrib: you ever heard of an issue, that when using beryl, when u launch applications from console like gedit&.. it doesnt show up actually, just a tag in systray appears and u gotta close it and rerun ?
[03:19] <S3> totem won't play MP3 files that are on remote shares, it only plays local files. Is there a fix? running AMD64 edgy.
[03:19] <Julez83> soundray: /boot is on /dev/hdb1, witch is currently mounted in /mnt/linux/ on the live-cd.
[03:19] <jrib> nuts7: nope, I don't use beryl.  But there is #ubuntu-xgl that deals just with beryl and similar programs.  They may know something about it there
[03:19] <apokryphos> bayzider: remove those extra lines from your sources.list
[03:19] <dooglus> eneried: there are DVD images here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/6.10/release/ but they're not the complete repositories
[03:19] <bayzider> apokryphos: how do I do that
[03:20] <apokryphos> bayzider: can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[03:20] <bayzider> ya
[03:20] <bayzider> h/o
[03:20] <xamox> how do I add a user to multiple groups?
[03:20] <eneried> doogius, thanks, but this is the main dvd, i know somebody have the repositories universe and multiverse on dvd
[03:20] <apokryphos> xamox: adduser someuser somegroup
[03:20] <apokryphos> or through the gnome configuration tool
[03:21] <gubluntu> how do i connect to ssh over serial to another machine i know is already setup to do so using getty
[03:21] <gubluntu> i see it running ttyin <getty>
[03:21] <xamox> apokryphos:  so say I have user, blah, I just do a adduser blah group1; adduser blah group2; ?
[03:21] <apokryphos> yes
[03:21] <xamox> apokryphos:  alright, thx.
[03:21] <compengi> is there a software from which i can monitor my cpu tempreture?
[03:22] <bayzider> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31672/
[03:22] <dooglus> eneried: how about http://pangea001.upc.es/ubuntu-dvd-torrents/cargol.net-ubuntu-dapper-univ-mult-rest-1.iso.torrent and http://pangea001.upc.es/ubuntu-dvd-torrents/cargol.net-ubuntu-dapper-univ-mult-rest-1.iso.torrent then?
[03:22] <soundray> Julez83: I suggest the following procedure: 'umount /mnt/linux && sudo grub', then type 'root (hd1,0)' and 'setup (hd0)' and 'quit'. If your (/mnt/linux)/boot/grub/menu.lst is okay, it should then boot successfully from the HD.
[03:22] <compengi> temperature*
[03:22] <dooglus> eneried: (that's rest-1 and rest-2 - I mis-copied the 2nd one)
[03:22] <Julez83> soundray: Ok, I'll try that. Thanks alot!
[03:22] <apokryphos> xamox: or easier adduser someuser -G group1 group2 etc
[03:22] <bayzider> apokryphos:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31672/
[03:23] <eneried> doogius, let me see
[03:23] <dooglus> eneried: HTML page here: http://cargol.net/~ramon/ubuntu-dvd-en
[03:23] <apokryphos> bayzider: edit it and remove the last line
[03:23] <soundray> compengi: I get the best results with mbmon. It's kernel- and ACPI-independent.
[03:23] <soundray> !mbmon | compengi
[03:23] <eneried> i'll take a closer look. but they seems to be dapper
[03:23] <samu> dooglus, so i just put the commands to run on separate lines in ~/.xprofile ?
[03:23] <ubotu> mbmon: Hardware monitoring without kernel dependencies (text client). In component universe, is optional. Version 2.05-4 (edgy), package size 65 kB, installed size 196 kB (Only available for i386 hurd-i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 knetbsd-i386)
[03:24] <bayzider> apokryphos: so I should save it a this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31673/
[03:24] <boink> which modules you need for a WG511T wireless card?
[03:24] <boink> on edgy .. system won't see it
[03:24] <dooglus> samu: yes, with a "&" at the end of each line to make the script not wait for each program to finish before running the next one
[03:24] <eneried> that page told about waiting a while for the DVDs
[03:24] <apokryphos> bayzider: right
[03:24] <bayzider> apokryphos:ok lets see if this works
[03:25] <samu> dooglus, ah yeah, good point
[03:25] <dooglus> eneried: they're possibly dapper dvds he's got there at the moment
[03:25] <boink> dapper is less buggy than edgy
[03:25] <compengi> soundray, which one the x-mbmon or mbmon?
[03:25] <dooglus> samu: I think ~/.xprofile is a ubuntu-specific change to gdm.  debian doesn't use .xprofile
[03:25] <Julez83> Soundray: Alright. Had to do sudo in front of umount, but other than that everything seemed to work. Here goes nothing! :P
[03:25] <soundray> compengi: you definitely need mbmon. xmbmon is optional
[03:25] <Scot1> ok cannot find disk formater for usb disk
[03:26] <eneried> i have to go to work. I search for those DVDs later at cargol. Thanks doogius. Bye.
[03:26] <dooglus> Scot1: what format do you want it in?
[03:26] <Psy-X> investigating
[03:27] <battlesquid> does someone here have experience with games crashing when changing video mode (or that's what seems to be the cause here)? when changing video mode in battle for wesnoth  (and sometimes when starting or exiting the program) the screen goes black and i'm not able to alt+tab, ctrl+alt+bkspc or even ctrl+alt+del my way back to desktop (also tried ctrl+alt+f2).. the only way is by hard reset.
[03:27] <compengi> soundray, how to run it?
[03:27] <Scot1> good question.  what ever works in linux and windows because i use wmware
[03:27] <dooglus> if you want a FAT format, "sudo apt-get install dosfstools" and then "mkfs -t msdos /dev/whatever"
[03:27] <soundray> compengi: 'sudo mbmon'
[03:27] <dooglus> Scot1: if you want a FAT format, "sudo apt-get install dosfstools" and then "mkfs -t msdos /dev/whatever"
[03:27] <nuts7> hm, sry to annoy u once again;) but ne1 of you ever heard of an issue, that when using beryl, when u launch applications from console like gedit&.. it doesnt show up actually, just a tag in systray appears and u gotta close it and rerun ?
[03:27] <samu> gnome-screensaver sucks
[03:28] <dooglus> samu: you are correct.  xscreensaver ftw
[03:28] <zach634> bah, intel macs wont compile ircII or bitchx
[03:28] <soundray> dooglus: will this create a FAT16 or FAT32?
[03:28] <kmaynard> zach634, .deb?
[03:28] <zach634> source
[03:28] <compengi> soundray, is x-mbmon gui?
[03:28] <battlesquid> or if you don't know anything about it could you help me out my sending me in the right direction? i use ubuntu so i figured it's the right place to ask
[03:29] <dooglus> soundray: -F FAT-size Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12, 16 or 32 bit).  If nothing is specified,  mkdosfs  will  automatically select  between  12  and  16  bit,  whatever  fits better for the filesystem size.
[03:29] <kmaynard> zach634, i know...what's wrong with the debs?
[03:29] <samu> it was such a disappointment when i upgraded from humm maybe it was 5.10 and noticed there was like zero settings for the screensavers
[03:29] <zach634> debs wont work on osx?
[03:29] <kmaynard> fair enough :)

[03:30] <dooglus> zach634: are you the joker who was here a while ago asking BSD questions?
[03:30] <kmaynard> os x rules
[03:30] <samu> is it a conscious gnome decision in gnome-screensaver to "not confuse me with too many options" or have the gnome-screensaver developers just been lazy?
[03:30] <zach634> dooglus: I don't think I was
[03:30] <dooglus> samu: it's a conscious decision all over GNOME to not confuse the user with options.
[03:31] <samu> i think i should start using KDE maybe...
[03:31] <dooglus> samu: if you want lots of options, KDE is where it's at, apparently.
[03:31] <zach634> I'm the joker who cant get hldsupdatetool.bin to run and who tells everyone to use chmod which will apparently "break" their rigs
[03:31] <dooglus> samu: did you see Linus' rant about GNOME?
[03:31] <kmaynard> yeah, gnome doesnt confuse you with options, it just hides the good ones in gconf :)
[03:31] <samu> dooglus, yeah ive read at least one famous line from him about it
[03:31] <kmaynard> dooglus, link?
[03:32] <babo> When I try to download a second torrent I get an error message "Couldn't Listen - Address already in use" ...
[03:32] <samu> "just tell people to use KDE" or something
[03:32] <babo> My torrent seems to be listening on ALOT of different ports ...
[03:32] <zach634> kubuntu?
[03:32] <RiGLEY> How can I play quicktime videos in Opera? Is it possible?
[03:32] <dooglus> Linus: 'This "users are idiots, and are confused by functionality" mentality of Gnome is a disease. If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it' -- "http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html

[03:37] <paradizelost> hey all, with skype on edgy, every time i receive a call, the computer seems to hardlock for the duration of the ringing, about 1/2 second of the ring actually plays, and then back to normal
[03:37] <Scot1> I tried dofsutil and it cannot open the device /media/iomega, so went to vmware windows and dos only goes to 244meg
[03:37] <samu> zach634, gotta eat some dinner first
[03:37] <dooglus> babo: I'm talking about the listening port.  every connection to a peer will use an extra port - it's to be expected that you'll see lots of connections in netstat.
[03:37] <paradizelost> any ideas?
[03:37] <christianp> hi all
[03:38] <dooglus> babo: "man bittorrent-downloader.bittorrent" shows me that by default bittorrent will listen on ports 6881 to 6889, whichever is free
[03:38] <zach634> i can install ubuntu-desktop (as in 32-bit) on an amd64 processor, and it will just emulate, like windows, right?
[03:38] <christianp> i'm trying to compile, but when i run ./configure i have this error: "checking for C++ compiler default output file name... configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables" for every file i want to compile.
[03:38] <christianp> what's the matter?
[03:38] <BooBar> how do i kill the x server and gdm
[03:38] <ChaosFan> zach634: no, it will run 32bit
[03:39] <christianp> what package i need?
[03:39] <paradizelost> zach634, amd64 processors have the 32 bit insruction set on them
[03:39] <zach634> christianp: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[03:39] <christianp> thanks, zach634
[03:39] <christianp> :)
[03:39] <paradizelost> zach634, so the 32 bit and 64 bit will run natively
[03:39] <zach634> well yeah, that's what I meant, it would run 32 bit

[03:40] <zach634> Scythe: I prefer to be called "enlightened"
[03:40] <babo> dooglus: so it can open the higher range ports at will, but the lower range ports need to be specifically opened ?
[03:40] <dooglus> thevenin: do you know about "pkill"?
[03:40] <Scythe128> how do you kill using the process list?
[03:40] <babo> what ever happened to the linux version of utorrent ?
[03:40] <thevenin> no i didnt know about pkill

[03:40] <Scot1> anyone know a better way to format a usb disk of 60 gig
[03:40] <thevenin> the kill -9 proccess
[03:41] <BooBar> ok
[03:41] <dooglus> babo: it should try 6881, and if that's in use, try 6882, etc.  if you're only downloading 2 torrents then there shouldn't be a problem.  what command are you running by the way?
[03:41] <BooBar> i try
[03:41] <paradizelost> BooBar, is the X server locked? ctrl+alt+backspace only kills X, you need to do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[03:41] <paradizelost> to kill both
[03:41] <BooBar> thqats the one thank
[03:41] <babo> dooglus: I'm just using gnome ...
[03:41] <paradizelost> otherwise u get to kill lots of processes
[03:41] <hyakuhei> Scot1: define what you want by format, do you want a new FS or a *clean* disk?
[03:41] <Scot1> it is currently ntfs
[03:41] <dooglus> babo: oh, I see.  you're using the GUI client?
[03:42] <paradizelost> Scot1, u want it to be read/write in windows and linux?
[03:42] <babo> dooglus: yip
[03:42] <Scot1> i tried to vmware and format dos but only get 244 meg
[03:42] <paradizelost> use vfat, or ext2, and load the driver in windows
[03:42] <Scot1> yes
[03:42] <dooglus> babo: when I asked which client, you said "bittorrent".  the correct answer would probably have been "gnome-btdownload"
[03:42] <hyakuhei> Scot1: what fs do you want?
[03:42] <paradizelost> Scot1, vfat will be read/write in both OS's.
[03:42] <dooglus> babo: I'll install it and take a look at it.

[03:47] <susscorfa> CPrgmSwR2: first try to boot from cd
[03:48] <paradizelost> Phaqui, uhh, you use your cd burning software to make a music CD, then put  the files on it
[03:48] <elriah> Hi all.  When I do an apt-cache search for a 2.6 smp kernel I'm not getting any hits in 6.10, any suggestions?  I really miss my 6.06 smp kernel ...
[03:48] <paradizelost> it *should* auto-convert them
[03:48] <Phaqui> and what cd burning software would that be?
[03:48] <nuts7> hey, any chance to install yacc for ubuntu?
[03:48] <susscorfa> it that works i think your prety save installing it CPrgmSwR2
[03:48] <Scot1> anyone know why sudo mkfs.vfat /media/IOMEGGA_HDD cannot use device
[03:48] <paradizelost> k3b should do the trick
[03:48] <CPrgmSwR2> oh cool
[03:48] <phpnuborn> who here is running vmplayer on windows with ubuntu in vmplayer?
[03:48] <paradizelost> it's what i use for burning CD's
[03:48] <CPrgmSwR2> Because I am finding that most people like to have the latest software - whatever it is
[03:48] <paradizelost> phpnuborn, i stick with vmware server, it's free as well, and more powerful
[03:49] <Phaqui> okay, I'll try that, thanks paradize
[03:49] <dooglus> babo: even if I specify "--min-port 6882", it still tries to listen on port 6881, and fails.  looks like a bug.
[03:49] <zach634> scot1: because iomega has one 'G' ?
[03:49] <martyyyr> does anyone know how to uninstall the flashplayer (which I installed via my browser)... I'm using Edgy, firefox 2
[03:49] <akruth> anybody here who knows about vpnc?
[03:49] <phpnuborn> what does vmserver get me?
[03:50] <paradizelost> Scot1, that's because /media/IOMEGA_HDD is not the device
[03:50] <dooglus> babo: I use azureus for torrenting.  it's pretty good, if a little memory hungry.
[03:50] <Scot1> how do i know what device it is
[03:50] <dooglus> akruth: I used to use it
[03:50] <paradizelost> dmesg|grep iomega
[03:50] <zach634> Scot1: isnt the device in /dev/ ?
[03:50] <Julez83> I still have troubles with GRUB. I've tried to "Sudo grub", and root "(hd1,0)". I then "setup (hd0)", but I still cant get GRUB to work. I have two physical drives, HD0 with NTFS (Win C:\, HDA) and HD1 with EXT3 (partition 1, HDB). Anyone have any ideas to what to do?
[03:50] <dooglus> nuts7: try 'bison' - it's a free 'yacc'
[03:50] <Scot1> not in /dev/
[03:51] <akruth> dooglus, I got a problem on reconnect, it fails, first connection works
[03:51] <paradizelost> Scot1, the device is in /dev/ i guarantee it
[03:51] <tom47> phpnuborn its handy for testing new releases, alternative distros, and, for those that feel inclined, to install windows and not need the inconvenience od dual boot
[03:51] <babo> dooglus: It must be an edgy thing then. I'm sure that it worked fine with dapper ...
[03:51] <paradizelost> Scot1, you have to unmount the /media one before you can format it
[03:51] <zach634> umount
[03:51] <dooglus> babo: maybe.  But I'm not running ubuntu at the moment, and it fails for me too
[03:51] <paradizelost> Scot1, type mount
[03:51] <Scot1> ok
[03:51] <paradizelost> it should show up in the list of mounted filesystems
[03:51] <babo> dooglus: ahh
[03:51] <dooglus> babo: I'm running debian sid, which is pretty close to edgy I guess
[03:52] <paradizelost> Scot1, probably something like /dev/sda1 or so
[03:52] <martyyyr> does anyone know how to uninstall the flashplayer (which I installed via my browser)... I'm using Edgy, firefox 2
[03:52] <Scot1> ok found it with mount.  let me work it
[03:52] <dooglus> babo: here's the debian bug report: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=394236
[03:53] <paradizelost> Scot1, you will lose ALL data on it if you do the mkfs.vfat FYI
[03:54] <soundray> Julez83: are the jumpers set correctly (master/slave)?
[03:54] <Scot1> thanks all got it donw
[03:55] <babo> dooglus: ahh OK cool. dude what's the big difference between the higher and lower ports again ?
[03:55] <babo> Do you have to be root to open a lower port ? Are lower ports just for listening on ?
[03:55] <soundray> martyyyr: find libflashplayer.so (e.g. with locate) and delete it.
[03:56] <dooglus> babo: to fix the problem, run this in a terminal:
[03:56] <dooglus> babo: gconftool --type int -s /apps/gnome-btdownload/settings/max_port 6889
[03:56] <LjL> babo: yes, ports below 1024 are supposed to be only used by listening services, and yes, you normally need root
[03:56] <martyyyr> soundray:  locate libflashplayer.so ?
[03:56] <dooglus> babo: the problem is that the min_port and the max_port are set to be the same - so only one port (and hence, only one download) can be used at once
[03:56] <akruth> hi, I got a problem with vpnc 0.3.3, everytime I disconnect and connect again I don't get a connection (can't ping)
[03:56] <soundray> martyyyr: yes
[03:56] <Julez83> Soundray:Yeah, what is now HD1 used to be set as master, and HD0 was slave, but I changed that because what is now HD0 is bigger and faster.
[03:56] <martyyyr> soundray, no results
[03:57] <zach634> later all
[03:57] <soundray> martyyyr: run 'sudo updatedb', then try again (takes a while)
[03:57] <martyyyr> k, thanks
[03:57] <dooglus> babo: you have to be root to listen on a port lower than 1024 (I think it's 1024)
[03:57] <martyyyr> soundray: lol, it took 2 seconds :P
[03:57] <LjL> dooglus: not sure whether it's <=1024 or <1024
[03:58] <slavik> dapper problem ... gksudo does not work properly
[03:58] <LjL> !doesn't work
[03:58] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[03:58] <dooglus> LjL: I would have expected "man 2 listen" to tell me, but it didn't
[03:58] <soundray> martyyyr: don't lol me. You haven't got much data then. Found libflashplayer.so now?
[03:58] <slavik> it asks for apssword but never launches the program I want to run
[03:58] <LjL> dooglus: it's up to 1023
[03:58] <LjL> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers
[03:59] <babo> err 1024 == 2 to the power of 10 ... which probably suggest 0-1023 ... ??
[03:59] <LjL> slavik: i assume it's graphical programs that you're trying to launch?
[03:59] <martyyyr> soundray: that wasn't meant as an offense or anything like that...
[03:59] <martyyyr> and yes, I found it
[03:59] <LjL> babo: yeah indeed
[03:59] <rambo3> !info php5-pear
[03:59] <ubotu> Package php5-pear does not exist in any distro I know
[03:59] <slavik> LjL: yes, synaptic is 1 of them
[04:00] <poulap> kpdf is to open pdf. i dont understand why it tells me -->Could not open file:///home/poulap/Desktop/Apress.Beginning.Ubuntu.Linux.From.Novice.to.Professional.Mar.2006.pdf
[04:00] <LjL> !info php-pear | rambo3
[04:00] <slavik> I am part of the admin group ...

[04:00] <compengi> poulap, you need a pdf plugin for your firefox
[04:00] <rambo3> LjL, i searched rpos and i know that there os php-pear
[04:01] <stjepan> anyone knows any magnifying apps, but more powerful than xmag??
[04:01] <LjL> rambo3: and it appears to have a "5" version number
[04:01] <poulap> am not viewing with a browser
[04:01] <rambo3> i just dont get why there is php4-pear
[04:01] <poulap> it is a file i have in pdf
[04:01] <rambo3> LjL, why not call it php5-pear then
[04:01] <compengi> poulap, install adobe reader then
[04:01] <akruth> exit
[04:01] <slavik> rambo3: php4 for old php, php for new php
[04:02] <poulap> ok thanks
[04:02] <rambo3> slavik i know that lol
[04:02] <LjL> rambo3: why not give every package there's around a name that includes the version number then
[04:02] <compengi> poulap, do you know how?
[04:02] <slavik> LjL: so, gksudo not working properly ... any ideas?
[04:02] <paradizelost> LjL, because that would be a pain
[04:02] <LjL> paradizelost: that was my point
[04:02] <rambo3> well somehow php-pear and php4-pear . it look like php4 is newer
[04:02] <poulap> isn.t it the same way we find other software ?
[04:02] <paradizelost> ahh.k
[04:02] <LjL> slavik, no, otherwise i'd have told you. i'm googling though
[04:02] <rambo3> but it isnt
[04:02] <slavik> ty
[04:03] <LjL> and i'm a KDE user so perhaps i'm not the best person to find out about this
[04:03] <filip_> I need a good fileshareing client similar to fulDC or DC++..
[04:03] <slavik> don't you have gksudo in KDE?
[04:03] <dooglus> stjepan: gnome-mag ?
[04:03] <Julez83> Soundray: Weird thing is, when i go "setup (hd0)", i get reports that stages one, two and e2fs stage1_5 exists, Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0)"...  15 sectors are embedded.
[04:03] <Julez83> succeeded and Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 d (hd0) (hd0)1+15 p (hd1,0)/boot/grub/stage 2 /boot/grub/menu.lst... succeeded". Does that mean that is /should/ be ok?
[04:03] <poulap> i will go and see if it is in the software to add....
[04:04] <georgeb> rambo3: run sudo apt-cache show php-pear php4-pear it will give you some more info
[04:04] <elriah> Anybody have a fix for the nvidia driver under 2.6.17 generic?
[04:04] <stjepan> dooglus, tnx
[04:04] <yacek19> hi
[04:04] <rambo3> georgeb, i didnt ask you
[04:04] <LjL> slavik, no, we've got kdesu
[04:04] <yacek19> how to disable acpi in xorg.conf so message: Open ACPI failed (/var/run/acpid.socket) (No such file or directory)  will not appear?
[04:04] <soundray> Julez83: yes, it does.
[04:04] <compengi> poulap, sudo apt-get install acroread mozilla-acroread acroread-plugins it will install the adobe reader with a firefox plugin
[04:04] <dcorbin_enttek> I'm helping a co-worker setup Kubuntu.  The control settings will not let the main screen to a refresh rate other than 60hz, even though they it is capable.  Suggestions?
[04:05] <poulap> compengi thanks
[04:05] <compengi> poulap, np
[04:05] <LjL> slavik, can't find much. there is https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gksu/+bug/67803 but i'm not sure it sounds very relevant
[04:06] <soundray> Julez83: one thing you could try is to run the same again, but with 'setup (hd1)'. Maybe for some reason your BIOS still reads the MBR of hdb. It would then find the new grub there.
[04:06] <tom47> poulap i hope that pdf is as interesting as its named
[04:06] <dooglus> dcorbin_enttek: you can try a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" or manually edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:06] <Julez83> soundray: Hmm... would it be any idea to try to switch them back (set the linux-drive as master and win as secondary), then sudo grub, root (hd0,0) and then setup (hd0)?
[04:06] <soundray> Julez83: so on the live system, 'sudo grub', 'root (hd1,0)' and 'setup (hd0)' then 'quit'
[04:07] <poulap> tom47 hmmm. it cound.y find the plugins
[04:07] <jrib> slavik: what does 'sudo echo hi' return in a terminal?
[04:07] <soundray> Julez83: it might be, but Windows might not like that.
[04:07] <Julez83> soundray: Ok, will try that. Thanks for the advice
[04:07] <dcorbin_enttek> dooglus I did the former, and select 75Hz.

[04:08] <dooglus> dcorbin_enttek: ok, that's as far as my knowledge goes I'm afraid.
[04:08] <jrib> vincenz: maybe crossover office?
[04:08] <dcorbin_enttek> are modelines for the monitor, or the video card?
[04:08] <vincenz> jrib: What is this?
[04:08] <soundray> vincenz: Crossover office runs powerpoint (but is payware)
[04:08] <dooglus> vincenz: "win4lin" used to be pretty good when all it ran was win98.  it's also payware.
[04:08] <poulap> well i can't find the plug in for reading my pdf file
[04:08] <arnducky> LjL: relaxen und shuttenzie mit der botten, I'm here to ask a Question in Englische

[04:09] <vincenz> I tried installing vmware but that completely borked when it tried to compile a module against the kernel
[04:09] <arnducky> ;-)
[04:09] <b1ackBart> vincenz: use crossover
[04:09] <Julez83> Got the same message, everything seems to be in order. Trying my mnpth reboot for the day. Seeyas all soon. :P
[04:09] <soundray> vincenz: vmware is another possibility
[04:09] <vincenz> I mean I use OOo, and it is good.  But sadlyl for powerpoint it is not -that- good as the layout borks when you move to powerpoint
[04:09] <znull> any good howto to install ati drivers (for radeon 9200)?
[04:09] <soundray> arnducky: pm me for some German lessons ;)
[04:09] <arnducky> I'm wondering what the best way to upgrade Dapper 6.06LTS to Edgey 6.10 is in my case
[04:09] <b1ackBart> use crossover for powerpoint--works fine for office 97 or 2000
[04:10] <vincenz> Alright, I wil ltke a look, thank you for the suggestion
[04:10] <dooglus> LjL: thanks, but I think that is only for putting these archives together, not for pulling them apart...
[04:10] <jrib> !upgrade | arnducky
[04:10] <ubotu> arnducky: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")
[04:10] <dooglus> LjL: you're supposed to run the archive in windows (it's a .exe) - but then the payload goes off, and I don't want that.
[04:10] <poulap> i want to read my pdf file lol
[04:10] <dooglus> poulap: did you try opening it in evince?
[04:11] <poulap> i dont seem to be able to d/l the plugin or whatever you guys sais

[04:12] <simon__> Can someone recommend a desktop recording program which isn't Istanbul?
[04:13] <segosa> i have a fresh install of the server version of the latest release of ubuntu, and i have a weird problem: if I create a user using "adduser name" the permissions on the user are wxr-xr-x allowing any other user on the system to read the contents of the person's home dir.. what on earth is going on?
[04:13] <slavik> simon__: Istanbul is a city in Turkey
[04:13] <Mastastealth> simon__: I've heard a lot about screenkast
[04:13] <dooglus> slavik: could somebody have replaced sudo with a script which saves your password somewhere for later abuse, and then runs the real sudo?
[04:13] <LjL> dooglus, all that i found out is that those packages use standard compression algorithms (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System ), so you could possibly identify the header of the actual archive and strip the rest
[04:13] <slavik> dooglus: no
[04:13] <yoric> hi
[04:13] <simon__> slavik: And a program which is meant to record desktop sessions, but just breaks.
[04:13] <LjL> dooglus, an example of such a file?
[04:13] <soundray> simon__: vnc2swf (there is no ubuntu package though)
[04:13] <yoric> I have a strange problem with my edgy.
[04:14] <yoric> When the screen locks, keys "z", "x" and "c" are lost for X.

[04:14] <slavik> and this started happening after updating yesterday
[04:14] <simon__> soundray: Que?
[04:14] <poulap> shoot. that is what it is. my file is corrupted i guess
[04:14] <dooglus> LjL: I can't find it now!
[04:14] <simon__> soundray: Oh.
[04:14] <poulap> i can view other pdf :(
[04:14] <simon__> soundray: Heh, okay.
[04:14] <simon__> soundray: Thanks.
[04:14] <LjL> dooglus: well, i guess winamp perhaps?
[04:14] <slavik> gksudo redirects to gksu ... is that right?
[04:15] <soundray> slavik: yes.
[04:15] <compengi> poulap, can you try to search for it in repos?
[04:15] <compengi> poulap, search for acroread
[04:15] <poulap> i took it on newsgroup lol
[04:15] <tuxtheslacker> hello. what is the repo name for gnome-meeting? or is it even in the repos?
[04:15] <soundray> slavik: confusingly, gksu is the graphical sudo, not the graphical su
[04:15] <soundray> tuxtheslacker: ekiga
[04:15] <Mastastealth> tuxtheslacker: ekiga
[04:15] <arnducky> soundray, is that a (V)irtual (N)etwork (C)omputing to (s)hock(w)ave (f)lash vnc paradigm? (like the VNC Java client)?
[04:15] <tuxtheslacker> Ekiga isn't gnome meeting is it?
[04:16] <soundray> arnducky: so I'm told
[04:16] <dooglus> LjL: it's not uncommon to see it used with open source windows programs.  but I'm struggling to think of where I've seen it recently.
[04:16] <Mastastealth> Ekiga is gnome meeting
[04:16] <tuxtheslacker> or is gnome-meeting truncated?
[04:16] <slavik> soundray: I understand that, the problem is that it doesn't work ... in Dapper

[04:17] <dooglus> LjL: here's a good example: Mozilla Firefox
[04:17] <pdlnhrd> before i upgraded to edgy. i had a kernel with smp support, now it seems the default kernel does not have this support?   which is the correct kernel to install that will give me smp support, doesn't look like i can find one that is for the 2.6.17 kernel
[04:18] <dooglus> LjL: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-2.0&os=win&lang=en-US
[04:18] <Mastastealth> smp support is built into the kernels now, no need for spearate ones
[04:18] <soundray> pdlnhrd: you should have smp by default. Check with cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:18] <Mastastealth> iirc
[04:18] <slavik> hmm, if I do gksudo synaptic from terminal it works, but using the launcher it asks for password and doesn't launch synaptic, the launcher uses gksu
[04:18] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  it is only showing one
[04:18] <LjL> dooglus: i'll see. i was trying with winamp now, but didn't find any obvious header
[04:19] <soundray> pdlnhrd: do you have dual core, true multi-CPU or hyperthreading?
[04:19] <tom47> poulap interesting pdf indeed ... i have it viewing in acroread
[04:19] <slavik> pdlnhrd: do 'uname -a' and paste the output
[04:19] <dooglus> LjL: the header will have to be the Windows PE executable stuff, right?
[04:19] <pdlnhrd> soundray: not true smp...   dual core .... Linux kubrick 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Fri Oct 13 18:41:40 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux

[04:19] <dooglus> LjL: this is a problem: $ file Firefox\ Setup\ 2.0.exe
[04:19] <dooglus> Firefox Setup 2.0.exe: MS-DOS executable PE  for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit, UPX compressed
[04:19] <slavik> you need the SMP kernel
[04:20] <slavik> the 686 one
[04:20] <LjL> dooglus: if the actual compression format is standard, we could find out where the compressed data begins
[04:20] <dooglus> LjL: it's UPX compressed - an extra layer of compression over the top
[04:20] <soundray> pdlnhrd: is it turned off in the BIOS by any chance?
[04:20] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  no
[04:20] <soundray> slavik: no, 2.6.17-generic has smp
[04:20] <poulap> tom47 u have it?
[04:20] <pdlnhrd> it was working before upgrade
[04:20] <jenda> I have trouble with beryl. Till now, I used fglrx+xgl+beryl, and it worked nice. Except the fact that xgl is a dirty hack and prevents other things from working right. Now I finally installed the opensource radeon driver, and run xorg+aiglx+beryl on that. However, it runs very slow, and makes it nearly unusable. gnome-panel eats up around 80% CPU.
[04:20] <poulap> tom47 where did u get it?
[04:20] <dooglus> hi jenda
[04:21] <der> Hi. I desperatly need the line to go in my Grub menu to have windows xp as a boot option
[04:21] <slavik> soundray: he has 386 not generic
[04:21] <LjL> dooglus, nice find, but probably not a problem, i can see the UPX stuff in the repos.
[04:21] <dooglus> LjL: on another example, I see: file.exe: MS-DOS executable PE  for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit, Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive
[04:21] <soundray> pdlnhrd: you've installed a kernel from somewhere other than the ubuntu repos?
[04:21] <compengi> poulap, he had installed it in the way it told you to but it seems you're having a source list issue
[04:21] <slavik> pdlnhrd: you want the generic kernel
[04:21] <poulap> tom7 must be away reading . he is not answering lol
[04:21] <compengi> poulap, what are using dapper or edgy?
[04:22] <dooglus> LjL: again, we have UPX compressors, but no UPX uncompressors?
[04:22] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  nope.
[04:22] <slavik> 2.6.17-10-generic
[04:22] <Mastastealth> jenda: the opensource radeon drivers aren't necessarilly the fastest thing you can get, is it unusually slow?
[04:22] <LjL> dooglus: nah, it can extract too
[04:22] <poulap> am sing ver. 6.10
[04:22] <poulap> using*
[04:22] <Paddy_EIRE> I have some new truetype fonts where do I put them
[04:22] <jenda> Mastastealth: well, unusually choppy.
[04:22] <dooglus> LjL: which one?  upx-ucl or upx-nrv?
[04:22] <yoric> der: do you need help about that ?
[04:22] <LjL> dooglus: i got upx-ucl now, and the manpage says it can expand
[04:22] <yoric> And in the meantime, any idea about my three missing keys ?
[04:22] <der> yes
[04:22] <der> I have had it before and cane here and somone told me the lines
[04:23] <yoric> der do you already have grub ?
[04:23] <soundray> pdlnhrd: try 'sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic'
[04:23] <der> grub is there menu is there
[04:23] <der> i am in it now
[04:23] <yoric> ok
[04:23] <compengi> poulap, change your source list to http://gnomefreak.pastebin.ca/246658
[04:23] <jenda> Mastastealth: and eats up all my CPU power just by sitting there.
[04:23] <yoric> So the problem is that you don't have an entry for Windows XP, is that it ?
[04:23] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  already installed to newest version
[04:23] <Mastastealth> der: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31685/ There's my Windows entry from GRUB
[04:23] <compengi> poulap, then run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:23] <LjL> dooglus: firefox.exe: MS-DOS executable PE  for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit <- worked
[04:23] <poulap> compengi thanks
[04:23] <yoric> well, ok, Mastastealth beat me to it :)
[04:24] <XiXaQ> hmm. How do I tell firefox which audio device to use?
[04:24] <dooglus> LjL: right, but it's not in nullsoft format, is it?
[04:24] <wolvie> Ubuntu 6.10 . Why after adding a nameserver to /etc/resolv.conf no name resolution is possible?
[04:24] <soundray> pdlnhrd: you haven't booted that kernel, though. Have you modified your /boot/grub/menu.lst by hand?
[04:24] <der> thanks:)
[04:24] <LjL> dooglus, perhaps not, since "file" doesn't mention that... what's that other example where it does?
[04:24] <yoric> wolvie: can you paste your resolv.conf ?
[04:24] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  i have not modified any config file by hand
[04:24] <jrib> segosa: see /etc/adduser.conf  that is default behavior for debian systems
[04:24] <LjL> dooglus: (well it does for winamp lite anyway)
[04:25] <segosa> jrib: so you mean on debian the same happens?
[04:25] <compengi> poulap, np
[04:25] <togepi> hello?
[04:25] <soundray> pdlnhrd: would you mind putting your /boot/grub/menu.lst on http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org ?
[04:25] <kopilo> hi
[04:25] <der> How do i edite it again?
[04:25] <wolvie> yoric, oh. Sorry I didn't add a 'nameserver' before a address.
[04:25] <der> so i can save it
[04:25] <togepi> can anyone help me install xgl/compiz
[04:25] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  it is in the grub file... it is just not the default... i will reboot and select the correct one on start up...
[04:25] <yoric> wolvie: I suspected something like that :)
[04:25] <XiXaQ> togepi, #Ubuntu-xgl
[04:25] <Mastastealth> der: sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[04:25] <soundray> pdlnhrd: hooray, found the prob
[04:26] <jrib> segosa: well debian policy is for a default umask of 0222 so yeah I assume so
[04:26] <wolvie> yoric thanks for your help :)
[04:26] <jrib> 022*
=== kopilo is now known as Komanjio
[04:26] <segosa> i see
[04:26] <poulap> compengi: that link. am not sure what am suppose to do there lol
[04:26] <pdlnhrd> soundray: lets hope... i don't know why it didn't get set as the default cause i added generic after the upgrade.. but i will try now... brb
[04:26] <togepi> join channel #ubuntu-xgl
[04:26] <jrib> segosa: you can edit that file to make it whatever you want though :)
[04:26] <segosa> yeah.
[04:26] <dooglus> LjL: /usr/share/file/magic is vaguely interesting
[04:26] <segosa> ty
[04:26] <togepi> join #ubuntu-xgl
[04:26] <togepi> how do i join?
[04:27] <dooglus> LjL: the example which shows the string 'nullsoft' when I 'file' it is a .exe I found when cleaning up my hard disk recently.  I don't know what it is, but I'm too scared to run it...
[04:27] <soundray> togepi: /join #ubuntu-xgl
[04:27] <slavik> togepi: add a slash in the beginning
[04:27] <togepi> ok...
[04:27] <[BTF] Chm0d> hey guys morning.  stupid question for you.  I know I have seen it but cannot remember where I can add how many virtual desktops to have?
[04:27] <dooglus> LjL: it's 187MB though
[04:27] <LjL> dooglus: hehe... well nevermind, winamp should do find as an example anyway
[04:27] <gyop> Hello
[04:27] <dooglus> LjL: winamp shows the 'nullsoft' string in 'file'?
[04:27] <Komanjio> [BTF] Chm0d: as many as you want or your computer can handle?
[04:27] <tom47> poulap http://www.esnips.com/doc/bb4c068a-7814-4968-b198-3712966d44c2/Apress.Beginning.Ubuntu.Linux.From.Novice.to.Professional.Mar.2006.pdf
[04:28] <LjL> dooglus, yup
[04:28] <soundray> [BTF] Chm0d: right click on workspace applet, select Preferences
[04:28] <[BTF] Chm0d> Komanjio: no i just want to have 4
[04:28] <poulap> tom47:thanks
[04:28] <[BTF] Chm0d> ive deleted that bar
[04:28] <tom47> poulap sorry for delay was just reading it
[04:28] <compengi> poulap, in your terminal do sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:28] <mc__> do you guys know some linux application that helps translating a book
[04:28] <soundray> [BTF] Chm0d: add a workspace switcher applet to another panel then.
[04:28] <[BTF] Chm0d> ok
[04:28] <[BTF] Chm0d> duh
[04:29] <tom47> poulap reads ok in evince as well as acroread
[04:29] <[BTF] Chm0d> thx very much
[04:29] <[BTF] Chm0d> just work up :)
[04:29] <compengi> poulap, then copy all what's written in the post
[04:29] <[BTF] Chm0d> woke
[04:29] <dooglus> LjL: maybe "cabextract - a program to extract Microsoft Cabinet files" is what we need?
[04:29] <Scythe128> how can I access my ntfs partitions as a normal user.  Root can, but my user cant
[04:29] <mc__> it should have spell chek,.pot support and feature that helps workin in groups over the internet
[04:29] <poulap> compengi. will do thanks
[04:29] <LjL> dooglus: i knew about that one, but i don't think, though i haven't tried it... .CAB's are compressed with neither gzip, bzip2 or LZMA as far as i know
[04:29] <slavik> dapper: gksudo doesn't work properly ...
[04:30] <Scythe128> can ark open them?
[04:30] <compengi> poulap, and replace them then save and exit, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:30] <gyop> mc__:  why dont you use google Language Tools http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en
[04:30] <dooglus> LjL: according to the magic file, nullsoft installer files are a kind of self-extracting .cab
[04:30] <soundray> !ntfs | Scythe128
[04:30] <ubotu> Scythe128: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[04:30] <LjL> dooglus: anyway no, at best "orange" is what we'd need (which uses cabextract)
[04:30] <poulap> ok
[04:30] <LjL> well i'll give orange a try then
[04:30] <Xnerd> x-server returns error 104. Yesterday it was fine (did dpkg.reconfigure xserver-xfree86). any help?
[04:30] <Scythe128> thanx
[04:30] <mc__> gyop, you misunderstood me
[04:30] <LjL> dooglus: but orange's description doesn't mention nullsoft installers
[04:30] <dooglus> LjL: "no valid cabinets found" anyway...
[04:30] <compengi> poulap, when you'll finish try sudo apt-get install acroread mozilla-acroread acroread-plugins :)
[04:30] <mc__> gyop, i want to translate  a book myself,but i want a software that helps communicating in a group
[04:31] <Mastastealth> for extracting cabs I've found you either need cabextract or unshield
[04:31] <gyop> mc__:  hmm
[04:31] <Chousuke> mc__: version control? ;)
[04:31] <poulap> got to save this log. too much info for me to try all at once lol
[04:31] <dooglus> LjL: I'm looking at nsis - maybe it can unpack, who knows?
[04:31] <compengi> poulap, lol
[04:31] <poulap> am green here
[04:32] <poulap> and on xchat also
[04:32] <LjL> dooglus, i looked, didn't look like it could... i didn't really read the man pages (if any) though

[04:32] <trelayne> Hi all ! I'm trying to VNC to my ubuntu machine. Xorg is loading vnc.so and I get password prompt. But it disconnects after putting the password.. I thougth the remote desktop password setup in ubuntu would take care of this. BUt it's acting like it doesn't know it exists

[04:33] <mc__> Chousuke, that is a possibility but i hoped for something more specialized

[04:34] <poulap> thanks guys
[04:34] <dooglus> LjL: http://forum.doom9.org/archive/index.php/t-26237.html tells me it's impossible to unpack them, and http://www.totalcmd.net/directory/packer.html offers a plugin for some Windows program that unpacks them...
[04:35] <Komanjio> solevita: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[04:35] <LjL> dooglus, perhaps - just perhaps - i found something, i.e. the header of an LZMA archive
[04:35] <compengi> poulap, your welcome
[04:35] <poulap> going to read now. hope i will learn a thing or 2 lol
[04:35] <solevita> restricted?  what?       okay I'll take a look at the pages,  thanks             (I'm using 6.06)
[04:35] <LjL> dooglus: wait a moment though 'cause i'm writing a short C program to strip that out (not knowing any better like how to do that with a shell script)
[04:35] <compengi> poulap, good luck
[04:36] <poulap> compengi thanks
[04:36] <rekahsoft> anybody have a Radeon 200M Xpress?
[04:37] <waylandbill> rekahsoft, I have that it in this laptop
[04:37] <eracc> If anyone is interested I posted to my web site an updated version of my document for using "growisofs" to make data backups on DVD+RW media. It is at http://www.eracc.com/unixlinux/growisofs_backups.html
[04:37] <soundray> rekahsoft: yes, in two different machines
[04:37] <rekahsoft> do you have the laptop already?
[04:37] <dooglus> LjL: you could use "tail -c +offset" to chop stuff off the front of a file
[04:38] <waylandbill> It's all set running with fglrx
[04:38] <rekahsoft> ok...i believe i have found a kernel bug that has to do with dedicated memory and the Radeon 200M
[04:38] <Scythe128> gee, thats not that specific set of circumstances :)
[04:38] <mc__> rekahsoft, what doe you make think so?
[04:39] <rekahsoft> could you give me the output of "dmesg | grep 0000:00:04
[04:39] <dooglus> LjL: "tail -c +offset" will chop (offset-1) bytes from the from of the stream
[04:39] <soundray> rekahsoft: empty on both
[04:40] <dooglus> rekahsoft: http://www.tux.org/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
[04:40] <rekahsoft> mc__: i believe this because with Radeon 200M Xpress cards you have to use UMA and cannot use Sideport...i am also getting alocation errors from the address where my ATI card is
[04:40] <LjL> dooglus, i haven't used that (used khexedit), but i got lzma to (apparently) decompress the stuff. now though i'm left with stuff that again, i don't know how to extract (no it's not a tar archive)
[04:41] <mc__> rekahsoft, well,that sounds really like a kernel bug,good job :)
[04:41] <LjL> dooglus: nevermind, lzma didn't decompress a thing. it just gave no error, but spat out the same, still compressed, file
[04:41] <tom47> poulap nw ... thanks for the heads up
[04:41] <waylandbill> rekahsoft, I get PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 7 of bridge 0000:00:05.0 and region 8... no 0000:00:04
[04:42] <Doxeal> hello evrybody
[04:42] <rekahsoft> thanks...i was stumped and figured it out a week ago and wanted to code a patch but am not very good with C and the kernel API's yet
[04:42] <dorto> Whenever ubuntu edgy boots, it is giving me "failed to initialize HAL" error in a pop up dialog box
[04:42] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  still there?  it was a bust.  i got dropped to a busybox shell.... don't know what to do from there
[04:42] <dorto> i tried to reinstall HAL related packages but the error persists
[04:42] <rekahsoft> waylandbill: that is exactly what i get with ever distro i have tried...it is definitly looking like a kernel bug...do you have fglrx working?
[04:42] <dorto> CDROM, USB pen drives etc are not automatically mounted anymore :(
[04:43] <LjL> dooglus, i have to go for a while - anyway LZMA files appear to begin with "5d 00 00 80". and that string is found in the Winamp Lite installation file, and it's shortly after an ASCII string that says "Inst"
[04:43] <soundray> dorto: System-Preferences-Removable...
[04:43] <waylandbill> rekahsoft, yes. I had to compile the kernel module with the m-a
[04:43] <catalytic> is it possible to run bigdesktop with fglrx on ubuntuu with ATI?
[04:43] <soundray> pdlnhrd: do you see the generic kernel in 'ls /boot'?
[04:43] <rekahsoft> waylandbill: it is the same thing..you just have to card at a different address
[04:43] <jonah1980> hi is there anything i can use to do a disk scan on my ipod under linux to make sure there's not bad sectors etc and fix any problems?
[04:44] <rekahsoft> i have fglrx working but i have to use UMA and share 128mb :(
[04:44] <fabricio> itapema
[04:44] <catalytic> are you using bigdesktop?
[04:44] <waylandbill> rekahsoft, I'm only sharing 64MB IIRC
[04:44] <pdlnhrd> soundray  initrd.img-2.6.17-10-generic   ?
[04:44] <vega__> Hello.
[04:44] <CPrgmSwR2> Can I upgrade from ubuntu edgy or will I have to burn another cd?
[04:44] <rekahsoft> well...i shared 128...i could change it if i wanted...i just want to use dedicated memory though
[04:44] <jonah1980> i've got rockbox installed but was hoping i could whack a scan over the ipod for disk maintenance
[04:45] <CPrgmSwR2> when something better comes out
[04:45] <Terminus> queestion guys, what kernel should i use for a pentium d? 686? this is also supposed to be a server? does that mean i should just use the server kernel instead?
[04:45] <dorto> soundray, the drives are not getting mounted because HAL is not working properly, Removable Media and Devices has all the options properly selected
[04:45] <vega__> Can someone remind me of the command to reinstall the ubuntu display interface so I can set my monitor resolution?
[04:45] <vega__> Just the command to run the wizard.
[04:45] <CPrgmSwR2> xconfigure
[04:45] <catalytic> anyone know how to get dual desktops with ATI , WITH direct draw
[04:45] <vega__> The full command please.
[04:45] <soundray> pdlnhrd: it's important to have that, but there should be a vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic as well
[04:46] <vega__> I'm still relatively new to ubuntu.
[04:46] <CPrgmSwR2> what kinda card do you have?
[04:46] <catalytic> me/
[04:46] <catalytic> ?
[04:46] <CPrgmSwR2> graphics card
[04:46] <catalytic> ATI radeon 9550
[04:46] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  yeah... vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic exists
[04:46] <CPrgmSwR2> I ment vega sorry
[04:46] <catalytic> currently running fglrx
[04:46] <catalytic> damn
[04:46] <CPrgmSwR2> 9550??
[04:46] <vega__> its an nvidia 7950GT
[04:46] <Terminus> vega__: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg i think.
[04:46] <catalytic> i thought someone might know the answer
[04:46] <vega__> thanks terminus, i think thats it
[04:46] <catalytic> been driving me nuts
[04:47] <CPrgmSwR2> you have 4 desktops by default in linux
[04:47] <catalytic> ...
[04:47] <catalytic> 2 screens
[04:47] <CPrgmSwR2> why would you need duel desktops with ati
[04:47] <vega__> That worked terminus, thanks a lot.
[04:47] <catalytic> 2 lcd screens
[04:47] <CPrgmSwR2> oh
[04:47] <Terminus> vega__: you're welcome. =)
[04:47] <catalytic> is nolimitsoya here?
[04:48] <vcef> hi
[04:48] <vcef> just a few question - is it possible to have multiple (two) swap disks in linux?
[04:48] <CPrgmSwR2> you mean two swap partitions
[04:48] <CPrgmSwR2> ?
[04:49] <vcef> yep
[04:49] <waylandbill> vcef, yes. multiple partitions and they can even be on different drives
[04:49] <vcef> great
[04:49] <vcef> so I just create swap partition on another disk and add it to /etc/fstab?
[04:49] <CPrgmSwR2> If I download kubuntu edgy will I have to burn a cd later on to continue to receieve updates
[04:50] <CPrgmSwR2> because it says something like 18 month support life
[04:50] <dooglus> CPrgmSwR2: you can have as many swap files and partitions as you like, within reason
[04:50] <soundray> pdlnhrd: let me have a look at your /boot/grub/menu.lst (pastebin)
[04:50] <CPrgmSwR2> I know that
[04:50] <trelayne> anyone know how to get a list of installed packages?
[04:50] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  should i try something like update-initramfs -u 2.6.17-10-generic ?
[04:50] <waylandbill> CPrgmSwR2, no you can use apt to update as usual.
[04:50] <CPrgmSwR2> Oh cool
[04:50] <CPrgmSwR2> because i am going to burn a edgy disk for a friend that wants to try out linux
[04:50] <dooglus> CPrgmSwR2: dapper has a longer support period than edgy, but with both of them you can just update to the next version without burning a CD
[04:51] <vcef> and does kernel take into considerations that these partitions are on different drives? I mean - if there's significant disk activity on one disk use swap on the other disk ...
[04:51] <murchadh> trelayne: dpkg -l >> applist.txt
[04:51] <CPrgmSwR2> why not make your swap partition larger vcef
[04:51] <pdlnhrd> soundray: http://pastebin.com/824172
[04:51] <dooglus> vcef: you don't add it to /etc/fstab - you run "sudo swapon" (see "man swapon")
[04:51] <CPrgmSwR2> rather than having 2
[04:51] <slavik> dapper: gksudo doesn't work properly
[04:51] <trelayne> thanks murchadh
[04:51] <waylandbill> vcef, yes it should load balance.
[04:52] <CPrgmSwR2> Is there an advantage to having 2 swap partitions?
[04:52] <Noah0504> Is it possible to do a server install from a 6.06 desktop install CD?
[04:52] <vcef> CPrgmSwR2: because the disk is full and because resizing is painfull. I have another empty drive and as waylandbill just said - kernel should load balance
[04:52] <Trixsey> Hey guys, when I'm sharing something on the network it's asking for user/pw.. what user/pw is that? I tried with my ubuntu account user/pw but it didn't work.. leaving it blank didn't work either
[04:53] <CPrgmSwR2> I just got the impression thier may be an advantage if you had mabye a duel processor or something
[04:53] <dooglus> vcef: see http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Partition/#multiple_swap_areas - you assign a priority to each swap partition, and "If each has the same priority, the kernel will write to them much like a RAID, with commensurate speed increases"
[04:53] <waylandbill> vcef, you could just make the swap right on the second disk... that would be a better scheme
[04:53] <kaur> what would be the optimal spindown time in secconds for a laptop's hd?
[04:54] <waylandbill> vcef, although if they are on the same ide bus, it doesn't much matter.
[04:54] <vcef> waylandbill: you mean - to have only one swap partition and don't use the one which sits on system disk?
[04:54] <CPrgmSwR2> oh cool I have bittorrent
[04:55] <murchadh> trelayne: In case you have problems with that try - sudo dpkg -l >> ~/applist
[04:55] <dooglus> Trixsey: how about using your ubuntu user name and a blank password?
[04:55] <m0biu5> does edgy use bootsplash?
[04:55] <trelayne> murchadh:  actually, all's good, thank you !
[04:55] <brush01uk> hi Ubotu, as a new user,can you give me a call on here please when you are free to help ?
[04:55] <waylandbill> having the swap on a different drive on a different bus would be rather efficient, but it's not like you're going to notice unless you have tons of activity (like serving files)

[04:57] <waylandbill> Linux AND porn? :-D
[04:57] <CPrgmSwR2> that too
[04:57] <CPrgmSwR2> can't forget the porn
[04:57] <Trixsey> dooglus: Didn't work either
[04:57] <soundray> pdlnhrd: I think you should remove "quiet splash" from the 2.6.17-10-generic entry and watch the boot messages to see why you drop into the busybox. Alternatively, try the recovery kernel.
[04:58] <CPrgmSwR2> now I have 3 days

[04:58] <pdlnhrd> soundray:  thanks again
[04:58] <CPrgmSwR2> apt-get install hald or apt-get install hal
[04:58] <dooglus> Trixsey: look in /etc/samba/smb.conf for how the passwords are set up
[04:59] <CPrgmSwR2> linux is starting to bypass windows
[05:00] <Noah0504> What's the better server, 6.06 or 6.10?
[05:00] <brush01uk> ok, thankyou, I have just installed over the last few days ubuntu E, working ok,,the problem is my slave hard drive not seen or detected,I  just seen info on the screen how to mount it (hdb1) nknow how do I  make a directory pleas
[05:00] <chowells> Noah0504: 6.06 has LTS, 6.10 doesn't
[05:00] <trelayne> Anyone know how I would go about patching vino? I'm on dapper
[05:01] <Noah0504> chowells: Well, it's just going to be a simple server for my home.  I'm sure they're pretty similar?
[05:01] <dooglus> Noah0504: they are pretty similar.  if you plan to keep updating when new versions come out, use edgy.  if you want to be able to leave it, dapper has longer support.
[05:02] <jonah1980> hi guys, i'm trying to do a disk check on my ipod - i've unmounted it and it's on dev/sdf - but when i type fsck.vfat /dev/sdf it says no such file or directory, can anyone please help me out?
[05:02] <waylandbill> brush01uk, if you add it to the /etc/fstab, and tell it where it should be mounted it will be mounted at boot time
[05:03] <kaur> what would be the optimal spindown time (in secconds) for a laptop's hd?
[05:03] <dooglus> brush01uk: if you just want to mount it now to check if it works, make a directory anywhere you like (say "sudo mkdir /mnt/slave" for example) then mount the drive: "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/slave"
[05:04] <dooglus> kaur: that depends on the load and your requirements.  how important is saving battery life vs. how much do you dislike having to wait for the disk to spin up again
[05:04] <brush01uk> Thankyou waylandbill, Im lost  Im thick ,do I do this in a text editor or in term ?
[05:05] <dooglus> brush01uk: /etc/fstab is protected - you'll need to use the administrator account "root" to edit it.  do a "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"
[05:05] <tang^> I unlocked my pc this morning and discovered some updates waiting for me. two things stick out at me: 1) isn't update-manager supposed to ask me for a password and 2) I don't recognise this avahi-daemon it wants to update
[05:05] <jonah1980> hello anyone? any help would be great thanks
[05:05] <dooglus> tang^: update-manager will only ask you for your password if you didn't already type it to some other admin program in the last 15 (?) minutes
[05:05] <dooglus> !info avahi-daemon
[05:05] <ubotu> avahi-daemon: Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon. In component main, is optional. Version 0.6.13-2ubuntu2.2 (edgy), package size 69 kB, installed size 324 kB
[05:05] <kaur> dooglus: saving the battery is not that important. I can also wait for the drive to spinup. The main reason i want it to spindown is that when it does, the laptop is quiet
[05:06] <erUSUL> tang^: avahi is a zeroconf protocol implementation. update-manager will not ask password if you are from admin group
[05:06] <LjL> jonah1980: perhaps you need sudo
[05:06] <sigger> what file do I have to change to have the 'ls --color=auto' alias set.  tried /etc/profile; tried changing Putty's identifier; tried ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc
[05:06] <brush01uk> dooglus, thankyou I  i just mounted  the drive  it says it is mounted
[05:06] <dooglus> erUSUL: update-manager should ask for a password - it runs as root, right?
[05:06] <dooglus> brush01uk: if you look in /mnt/slave, you should see your files
[05:06] <waylandbill> kaur, turn the radio up. ;-)
[05:06] <BooBar> is there a way to run the session managed from a term
[05:06] <brush01uk> ok
[05:06] <IA-Outdoors> if I need to recompile the kernel what do I need to do besides grab the linux-source?  I noticed installing it only downloads the .bz2 file so is there a how-to on this?
[05:06] <BooBar> is there a way to run the session manager from a term
[05:07] <jonah1980> ah i'll try
[05:07] <tang^> erUSUL: thanks. I don't recall adding myself to admin, but I did do an upgrade to edgy on friday
[05:07] <IA-Outdoors> I've done many a recompiles but not under ubuntu
[05:07] <dooglus> brush01uk: if you used the 'sudo mount' command, it's just a one-off mount.  if you want it mounted automatically each time you boot, you'll need to add a line to /etc/fstab
[05:07] <dooglus> BooBar: gnome-session-properties
[05:07] <Syn_Flood> hello all :)
[05:07] <jonah1980> should i run fsck unmounted or mounted cos at moment i'm not mounted and it says no such location exists??
[05:08] <tang^> dooglus: the only password I supplied was to unlock the workstation, so I guess this must be an upgrade related change
[05:08] <brush01uk> ok,  Thankyou dooglus
[05:08] <LjL> jonah1980: always unmounted
[05:08] <LjL> dangerous otherwise
[05:08] <brush01uk> I WILL GO & HAVE A PLAY

[05:09] <cparker> I installed KDE on Ubuntu 6.10, and when KDM starts up, I get an error message saying "Cannot open theme file /usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/kubuntu". How do I remedy this?
[05:09] <erUSUL> dooglus: see this third coment https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/59946
[05:09] <georgeb> sigger: you should modify ~/.bashrc and re-login
[05:09] <BooBar> dooglus: says i dont have the command and i havent got gnome-session
[05:09] <LjL> cparker: that file is contained in kubuntu-default-settings
[05:10] <waylandbill> cparker, that's part of kubuntu-desktop
[05:10] <LjL> directory, actually
[05:10] <das-q> I'm searching for a tool that checks windows-executables for common spyware etc., any tips? A search on the ubuntuforums-side gave no results
[05:10] <dooglus> das-q: "clamav"?
[05:10] <cparker> So, if I install the kubuntu-desktop package, that should fix the problem?
[05:10] <sigger> georgeb:  hmmm, did that one.  alias didn't get set tho
[05:10] <pdlnhrd> o.k i am getting close to solving my problem when i can not boot to 2.6.17-generic.... it seems that i get the error "alert /dev/disk/by-uuid/blah  does not exists.   i notice in my menu.list  that the uuid for 386 and generic have different uuid's     should i change them to match?
[05:11] <dooglus> das-q: it's not particularly good - I've tried it on a few files I know are infected, and it tells me they're fine
[05:11] <waylandbill> cparker, and probably other issues
[05:11] <das-q> dooglus: ah, already thought of that one, just wasn't sure if it's _the_ tool for only checking .exe-files every once in a while
[05:11] <Omnifrog> what is the /mnt/data tree for? is there documentation for it somewhere i can read?
[05:11] <das-q> dooglus: ah, hm
[05:11] <slavik> dapper: gksudo doesn't work properly. it asks for password (when trying to run synaptic) but then doesn't run the app
[05:11] <cparker> waylandbill: ok... any idea why installing kde on ubuntu doesn't automatically install the necessary packages?
[05:11] <dooglus> das-q: in the proprietary repository, there's another virus scanner - maybe pandasoft's or some such?  I didn't try it, and I think maybe that repo is only available for dapper at the moment?
[05:11] <FordPrefect> does anyone know how to change the browser XChat Laucnhes for links?
[05:12] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell cparker about kde
[05:12] <FordPrefect> it keeps launching mozilla instead of firefox
[05:12] <FordPrefect> bugs me.
[05:12] <dooglus> slavik: it sounds like you're trying to report a bug.
[05:12] <waylandbill> cparker, it's intended to be installed into kubuntu. bringing in kubuntu-desktop makes ubuntu into kubuntu
[05:12] <georgeb> sigger: you have to relogin; after modifying it, run "su - $USER", enter your password, and run alias | grep ls  and check if it changed
[05:12] <slavik> dooglus: more like trying to figure out why it doesn't work ...
[05:12] <cparker> Ah, thanks. :)
[05:13] <dooglus> FordPrefect: does running gnome-default-applications-properties do the trick?
[05:13] <dooglus> slavik: what about "sudo synaptic" - does that work?
[05:13] <georgeb> sigger: you might need to logout and login in gnome/kde to reload the enviroment
[05:13] <FordPrefect> Ahh horray!
[05:13] <FordPrefect> Thanks dooglus
[05:14] <FordPrefect> now I bet evolution will stop launching too!
[05:14] <sigger> georgeb: nope not their either.  If I sudo -i I get the color tho, but I don't wanna be running as root.
[05:14] <dooglus> FordPrefect: it's on one of the menus somewhere, but I don't remember where
[05:14] <waylandbill> cparker, it will have the gnome programs available in the kmenu (since they're already installed)
[05:14] <sigger> * there
[05:14] <FordPrefect> humm....but it ignored it :-/
[05:14] <FordPrefect> (XChat)
[05:14] <dooglus> FordPrefect: evolution should use the same setting as xchat - they're both GNOME programs
[05:14] <gyop> May i ask a question? everthing fine on my ubuntu but when i surfing on internet with firefox. Some pages scrolling very slowly.. Any idea about this?
[05:14] <Breetai> Hey all, running edgy, and when I try starting wmxmms which is a dockapp I get Gdk-ERROR **: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)  serial 142 error_code 8 request_code 62 minor_code 0

[05:14] <jonah1980> LjL, what's the best thing to use to fix and repair a disk for an ipod, it's a 20gb drive but someone told me fsck won't do anything or fix anything anyway
[05:14] <waylandbill> cparker, it's actually nice if you use some gnome/gtk stuff even in k... not a problem
[05:14] <FordPrefect> wonder if it will take effect next session
[05:15] <dooglus> FordPrefect: I assume you mean xchat-gnome, do you?  'cos xchat has its own menu for external programs
[05:15] <LjL> jonah1980, honestly i don't know
[05:15] <dooglus> FordPrefect: I doubt that logging out will help
[05:15] <jonah1980> LjL, also how do i unmount it without ejecting it? when i eject the command doesn't work cos says no such device
[05:15] <FordPrefect> no just plain xchat
[05:15] <dooglus> FordPrefect: these things usually take effect immediately in GNOME
[05:15] <FordPrefect> xchat-gnome is evil
[05:15] <LjL> jonah1980, doesn't umount work?
[05:15] <FordPrefect> I don't see such a menu on xchat
[05:15] <dooglus> FordPrefect: right.  in that case, isn't there a setting somewhere in the menus?
[05:15] <bean> hi, how can i take a screenshot of tty1? there r some weird error messages on it
[05:15] <jiegun> ./list
[05:16] <LjL> bean: install gpm, that allows you to use a mouse
[05:16] <LjL> jiegun: probably best not to type that command
[05:16] <jonah1980> LjL, unmount command not found it says when i type that
[05:16] <bean> LjL, thanks
[05:16] <LjL> jonah1980, i said "umount"
[05:16] <dooglus> FordPrefect: I'll take a look
[05:16] <georgeb> sigger: so the problem is that using your user you don't see colors ? in this case what does "alias | grep ls" shows when you run it as your user ?
[05:16] <Syn_Flood> also is anyone here familure with dansguardian and how the user/groups works.  I'm trying to find a place that explains this and i can't one.
[05:17] <dooglus> georgeb: just "alias ls" will do
[05:17] <georgeb> dooglus: oh.. thx :)
[05:17] <jonah1980> LjL, that works but it just says "/dev/sdf2: 2740 files, 2103150/4862201 clusters" and nothing else so i don't know if the thing is in good condition or not??

[05:20] <LjL> dooglus, uhm, so it's probably all the files joined together... you should find a way to split them correctly now
[05:20] <LjL> dooglus, couldn't you just use wine in the end anyway? =)
[05:20] <dooglus> LjL: I was thinking that it would probably be full of spyware.  I didn't want to let the spyware run.
[05:21] <LjL> dooglus, *shrug*, who cares? create an ad-hoc user
[05:21] <dooglus> LjL: I think I tried that, too, but it didn't work.  I've not had a lot of luck with wine tbh
[05:21] <baastrup> Hi, is there a ay to have bouth touchpad and a normal mouse working at the same time
[05:21] <Terminus> is security.ubuntu.com being hammered right now by any chance? i'm only getting 5Kbps here while updating.
[05:22] <waylandbill> I haven't found much that I can't do without wine... not that I've looked very hard.
[05:22] <dooglus> FordPrefect: xchat: settings -> advanced -> url handlers
[05:22] <LjL> dooglus, if the files are not glued together in a standard format (like tar), and your "file" output seems to imply they aren't, i suspect it's going to be far from easy to extract them :\
[05:22] <waylandbill> baastrup, sure. if they are both listed as input devices
[05:22] <FordPrefect> yeah I did that and added firefox
[05:23] <FordPrefect> so long as I don't do the open url in browser or left click it should be good
[05:23] <mbuf> what assembler do i need to install to compile 2.4 Linux kernel on Ubuntu Dapper, gcc-4.0 fails, have gcc-3.3 installed
[05:23] <dooglus> LjL: the '$R2' file plays OK in mplayer - I think it's just a renamed .mpg
[05:23] <FordPrefect> maybe once I restart xchat it will use firefox for "open in browser"
[05:23] <LjL> dooglus, ok, but then where are the other files?
[05:23] <baastrup> waylandbill: please explain, can i have more input devices at same time in xorg.conf
[05:23] <FordPrefect> nope...weird
[05:24] <FordPrefect> it really likes mozilla a lot
[05:24] <ailean> On http://www.google.com/trends?q=ubuntu%2Cvista&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all would I be right in saying that the spike at July 2005 is microsoft's announcement of Vista, which means that the straight line is the normal number of searches for the spanish word "vista"?And that the ubuntu searches start from zero in Oct 2004. This means that there are in fact MORE searches for ubuntu than windows?
[05:24] <LjL> dooglus, and that it plays in mplayer doesn't mean it doesn't *also* contain the other files. mplayer plays just about anything, whether it's corrupted or not...

[05:27] <khatahn> anyone running vmware player available from the Ubuntu Edgy package repositories? i'm just getting these errors when running it http://pastebin.com/824198 . it works though, but uses the ugly default gtk theme.
[05:28] <LjL> khatahn, same for me, it used to use the other theme in Dapper (but IIRC gave the same errors, not entirely sure though)
[05:28] <khatahn> LjL: yeah, it used to use the proper theme in dapper for me too
[05:29] <jackrazz> anyone know if its possible to have different desktop backgrounds for each of my 4 virtual desktops?
[05:29] <waylandbill> baastrup, looks like I have two, but one is commented out (the usb) ... which probably means the usb doesn't require it. So, I was incorrect in that respect.
[05:29] <jackrazz> 4 workspaces that is
[05:29] <incorrect> no i am incorrect
[05:29] <waylandbill> jackrazz, yes.
[05:29] <waylandbill> incorrect, lol
[05:29] <jackrazz> is it an add in waylanbill
[05:29] <bean> LjL, gpm runs weird for me. is there an easier way to save the screen buffer of a tty?
[05:29] <incorrect> man that joke never gets old
[05:30] <LjL> bean: digicam? :)
[05:30] <jackrazz> or is simpler than that, hang on
[05:30] <mikearthur> can someone with Java installed USING THE PACKAGE MANAGER type echo $JAVA_HOME in the console for me?
[05:30] <bean> LjL, ouch
[05:30] <waylandbill> jackrazz, just configure first, then configure next.. etc
[05:30] <LjL> bean: what works weird anyway?
[05:30] <jackrazz> no, just tried that
[05:30] <jackrazz> Im in ubuntu right?
[05:30] <bokey> has anyone here used microsoft's usb camera with Ubuntu ?
[05:30] <bokey> jackrazz# yes you are in #ubuntu
[05:31] <jackrazz> set desktop background in first workspace, then different one in next
[05:31] <jackrazz> both are the same
[05:31] <bean> LjL, gpm. i just can't select properly
[05:31] <jackrazz> hey bokey, just makeing sure we were not talking about kde
[05:31] <jackrazz> sorry for the confusion
[05:31] <LjL> bean, what program do you have running on the terminal?
[05:32] <bokey> jackrazz# well, yeah that would be #kde =)
[05:32] <jackrazz> waylandbill, im talking about one monitor and 4 workspaces
[05:32] <LjL> bean, for me it's as easy as it can get - drag from top left corner to bottom right corner, and then middle button to paste
[05:32] <warlock[S] > Anyone know how to configure a new ip to your server? (so it's shown in ifconfig -a)
[05:32] <waylandbill> jackrazz, my mistake I *was* talking about kde. :-D
[05:32] <jackrazz> ok bokey and waylandbill, thanks
[05:32] <jrib> mikearthur: it's empty, what do you expect it to be?
[05:32] <bean> LjL, nothing running, just a terminal with a prompt
[05:32] <jackrazz> anyone ever seen apps that would let me do that?
[05:32] <mikearthur> jrib: just curious, thanks
[05:32] <mikearthur> not a ubuntu user
[05:33] <bean> LjL, and some error msgs above
[05:33] <dooglus> FordPrefect: run "update-alternatives --config x-www-browser"
[05:33] <jackrazz> in some ways kde is more mature than gnome.
[05:33] <LjL> bean: then i don't see why you should get strange behavior... perhaps try shutting down X, restarting gpm (sudo /etc/init.d/gpm restart) and see
[05:33] <jackrazz> kinda feel like gnome is the baby!
[05:33] <dooglus> FordPrefect: that will show you which browser xchat uses when you "open in browser"
[05:33] <jackrazz> but still like it though
[05:34] <waylandbill> jackrazz, it just has a different approach to the desktop is all.
[05:34] <jackrazz> ok, guys...thanks for the answers - i was just hoping...
[05:34] <warlock[S] > Anyone know how to configure a new ip to your server?
[05:34] <LjL> warlock[S] : "man ipconfig", "man interfaces"
[05:35] <MarcN> warlock[S] : what do you mean by a new ip?   drop and restart the network for a new dhcp? new static IP? additional ip address on 1 nic?
[05:35] <dooglus> warlock[S] : run "sudo network-admin"
[05:35] <warlock[S] > well, not really. I have a RDNs pointed to my other ip, trying to setup a vhost for my bouncer server.
[05:35] <warlock[S] > addition ip address I guess.
[05:35] <LjL> warlock[S] : sorry, "man ifconfig" not ipconfig (that's the Windows equivalent, ouch)
[05:35] <bean> LjL, i don't even see a mouse cursor. i can select some text by luck, but when i middle click it in gedit it doesn't paste
[05:35] <Eons> does anyone know if gnome has some library that abstracts compressed files? (like tar, bzip and so on)
[05:36] <LjL> bean, the cursor only appears when you move the mouse here
[05:36] <MarcN> warlock[S] : man interfaces and add a eth0:1 static address
[05:36] <brush01uk> LjL SORRY
[05:36] <LjL> bean, no, it definitely won't paste in gedit. you need to paste in another virtual terminal.
[05:36] <warlock[S] > kk
[05:36] <Eons> I gave a look at gnomevfs but there was nothing interesting to me
[05:36] <dooglus> bean: if you run "screen" first, then run the apps inside screen, you can use screen to copy/paste the contents of the terminal window
[05:36] <LjL> bean, you can use nano as a terminal editor
[05:36] <bean> it's some bootup error messages
[05:36] <bean> i get them sometimes only
[05:36] <erUSUL> Eons: look at what file-roller does (afaik i calls the cl comands)
[05:37] <bean> so wanted to save them this time
[05:37] <brush01uk> sorry for any problems caused
[05:37] <LjL> bean: which you'll probably then find in /var/log
[05:37] <dooglus> bean: I've always used a digicam for bootup error messages
[05:37] <bean> ok
[05:37] <bean> thanks guys
[05:37] <dooglus> brush01uk: it sounds like you might still have the slave drive mounted, and you're trying to mount it again?
[05:37] <Maurox> does someone have problems with beryl 0.1.2 ?????
[05:37] <Eons> erUSUL: ok, good idea =P thanks
[05:38] <EmxBA> can someone explain me the meaning of word edgy?
[05:38] <LjL> EmxBA: it's just a codename, it means nothing,
[05:38] <georgeb> !beryl | maurox
[05:38] <ubotu> maurox: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[05:38] <warlock[S] > ?nopaste
[05:38] <warlock[S] > !nopaste
[05:38] <elriah> Anyone else having problems with 6.10's generic kernel and the NVIDIA drivers?
[05:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nopaste - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:38] <dooglus> EmxBA: (Fine Arts) Having some of the forms, such as drapery or the like, too sharply defined. ``An edgy style of sculpture.'' --Hazlitt.
[05:38] <EmxBA> LjL: doesn't mean nothing? shouldn't that be "more creatively challenging work; cutting edge; "
[05:39] <EmxBA> elriah: me
[05:39] <LjL> EmxBA: in the context of Ubuntu, it's just a codename.
[05:39] <socomm> EmxBA: Means being on the edge, or on edge.
[05:39] <Maurox> yes, the problem is that with the last update dosnt load properly :S
[05:39] <warlock[S] > http://nopaste.php-q.net/254088 - would this look correct when adding a new interface?
[05:39] <Eons> EmxBA: something like being on the bleeding edge
[05:39] <LjL> EmxBA: of course it means something in Edgy, but then that's offtopic here, you can ask a dictionary - as you've just done i guess
[05:39] <EmxBA> those newest beta drivers need to be reinstalled on every boot
[05:39] <LjL> err, in English i mean
[05:39] <EmxBA> thanks
[05:39] <warlock[S] > MarcN, http://nopaste.php-q.net/254088 - that correct? :)
[05:39] <brush01uk> dooglus, thankyou, ok, I think,where to go next or read please
[05:39] <socomm> EmxBA: In technical circles being the bleeding edge refers to being one of the early adopters.
[05:39] <EmxBA> and dapper, edgy, breezy and warthog also don't mean nothing?
[05:40] <dooglus> brush01uk: if you run just "mount", it will list all mounts currently active
[05:40] <bean> LjL, thanks found the error msgs.
[05:40] <dooglus> EmxBA: I think 'edgy' was intended to suggest "Daring, provocative, or trend-setting: an exhibition of edgy photographs; an edgy menu."
[05:40] <LjL> EmxBA, ask a dictionary. in the context of Ubuntu, no, they're just words Shuttleworth chose.
[05:40] <EmxBA> and this "edgy" is related to edgy new software and similar
[05:40] <EmxBA> LjL: thanks for that too! :)
[05:40] <Eons> EmxBA: most of them are just amusing nicknames
[05:40] <brush01uk> sorry in my term ?
[05:40] <bean> LjL, btw just curious how do u use nano as a terminal editor? nothing in the man pages
[05:41] <LjL> bean, type "nano"...
[05:41] <LjL> bean, and it definitely has a manpage anyway, "man nano". you probably don't really need it anyway, it's intuitive enough
[05:41] <EmxBA> bean: maybe you just want 'sudo update-alternatives --config editor'
[05:41] <elriah> EmxBA: Any luck (nvidia drivers)?
[05:41] <warlock[S] > http://nopaste.php-q.net/254088 - would this look correct when adding a new interface (new static ip)
[05:41] <EmxBA> no
[05:42] <dooglus> EmxBA: I can't find Mark's original annoucement of Edgy, but this will do: http://koolinus.wordpress.com/2006/04/19/the-edgy-eft/
[05:42] <EmxBA> elriah: i need to reinstall them at every boot
[05:42] <bean> LjL, no dude i mean to edit the screen buffer
[05:42] <bean> i'm not that n00b
[05:42] <bean> EmxBA, thx
[05:42] <elriah> EmxBA: How are you reinstalling them?  (thanks for any help)
[05:42] <LjL> bean, *no*, nano doesn't do that. it's just an editor that runs in the terminal, so that you can paste the GPM clipboard into it
[05:42] <dooglus> bean: he's talking about using nano as a target for your paste, after you've copied using the mouse-in-terminal thingy
[05:42] <bean> LjL, ok nvm gpm doesn't work 4 me
[05:43] <EmxBA> i've got NVIDIa
[05:43] <EmxBA> i've got NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run sorry
[05:43] <LjL> bean, gedit doesn't work because the X clipboard and the GPM clipboard are *not* the same
[05:43] <bean> dooglus, yeah i realized
[05:43] <EmxBA> and it does everything for me, elriah
[05:43] <bean> LjL, ok
[05:43] <LjL> bean, you need to run nano *in a virtual terminal*, not inside X, for GPM pasting to work
[05:43] <Maurox> dman, looks like beryl update for ubuntu mismatches with plugin versions :P
[05:43] <waylandbill> nano isn't intuitive if you've used vi for years... you end up with lots of j's all over the place. :-)
[05:44] <bayzider> Hi. I have recntly upgraded to edgy. Since then I have had some weird problems with firefox. When ever I try to go to like you tube or yahoo it immeditly xs out on me.
[05:44] <dooglus> brush01uk: in your terminal, ys
[05:44] <elriah> EmxBA: That's what I have.  I still get "failt to start the X Server" on the console.
[05:44] <elriah> hrm
[05:44] <jrib> bayzider: do these pages have all use flash?
[05:44] <EmxBA> elriah: just install nvidia drivers again using that script
[05:44] <Vaske_Car> How to install Java and Flash for Opera?
[05:45] <bayzider> jrib: most likely.
[05:45] <EmxBA> !java > Vaske_Car
[05:45] <mc__> Vaske_Car, just install it
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[05:45] <bean> LjL, ok it doesn't work lah
[05:45] <mc__> Vaske_Car, opera should detect it
[05:45] <jrib> bayzider: what bit-depth are you using?
[05:45] <Vaske_Car> mc_, done but it does not work with Opera, only with Firefox
[05:45] <bayzider> I mean like just www.yahoo.com and www.youtube.com crahs and whats bit depth.
[05:45] <mc__> Vaske_Car, if you are on 64bit you will ned the 32 bit versions
[05:45] <bean> LjL, but i guess i grep thru the logs
[05:45] <Vaske_Car> 32 here
[05:45] <LjL> bean, have you tried shutting down X and restarting GPM yet?
[05:45] <bean> LjL, nope but it's ok
[05:45] <elriah> EmxBA: Which kernel are you running?
[05:46] <warlock[S] > http://nopaste.php-q.net/254088 - would this look correct when adding a new interface (new static ip)
[05:46] <EmxBA> LjL, what does GPM stand for? it should be GDM in your last reply :S
[05:46] <LjL> bean, if they're very early boot messages, they might not be in the logs
[05:46] <LjL> EmxBA, no, i said GPM and meant it
[05:46] <bean> LjL, nope I found most of them
[05:46] <EmxBA> elriah: generic, and tried 386 too and nvidia drivers don't work
[05:46] <EmxBA> LjL: ok
[05:46] <LjL> EmxBA: GPM is the program you just installed to use the mouse in VTs
[05:46] <waylandbill> gdm != gpm
[05:46] <bayzider> jrib: I mean like just www.yahoo.com and www.youtube.com crash. also whats bit depth?
[05:46] <bean> LjL, just in different places
[05:47] <LjL> EmxBA: and you can find out what the acronym means by just typing "apt-cache show gpm"
[05:47] <jrib> bayzider: see if https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 is related to your problem

[05:47] <VegaObscura> Can someone remind me of the command to reinstall xserver again, I keep forgetting.
[05:47] <Fuller> Could someone tell me the commands for installing a debian package?
[05:47] <elriah> Looks like I need to reinstall 6.06 ... My  problem is with 6.10 ...

[05:47] <bean> LjL, do u mind taking a look at some of my error msgs?
[05:48] <elriah> Is there a apt command for a distro-downgrade, lol?
[05:48] <bean> shld i pastebin?
[05:48] <LjL> Fuller: installing packages intended for Debian can break systems.
[05:48] <EmxBA> Fuller: dpkg -i packagename.deb
[05:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell elriah about downgrade
[05:48] <bayzider> jrib: so what do I do on that sitee?
[05:48] <LjL> bean, sure
[05:48] <bean> thx
[05:48] <jrib> bayzider: did you read all the comments?
[05:48] <VegaObscura> I thought ubuntu worked fine with debian packagers.
[05:48] <Fuller> LjL: It can, huh? Maybe I'll get the tarball instead then. Thanks!
[05:48] <bayzider> jrib:no
[05:48] <elriah> LjL: I was kidding..
[05:48] <VegaObscura> packagers**
[05:48] <elriah> LjL: Thanks, though.
[05:48] <elriah> :p
[05:48] <Fuller> EmxBA: And thank you. I'll just file that away somewhere. :)
[05:48] <VegaObscura> god i cant type this morning
[05:49] <LjL> VegaObscura: you thought wrong. it uses .deb packages, that's true, but it's not compatible for packages *made for Debian*
[05:49] <bayzider> Its pretty simple I go to you tube or yahoo and rigt before its done loading fire fox xs out.
[05:49] <jrib> bayzider: read all the comments, there are two fixes, one is to export some environment variable and the other is to make sure you are using 24 bit-depth
[05:49] <waylandbill> VegaObscura, debian packages and ubuntu packages are not necessarily compatibile (especially relating to configuration)
[05:49] <brush01uk> dooglus, sorry Im thick,    I have pasted my my info, after typing mount  no luck so far
[05:50] <VegaObscura> I see.

[05:55] <unperson> Hi, I seem to be having some issues with installing flash on Ubuntu 6.06 LTS/dapper.  I've used apt-get to install the package flashplugin-nonfree, and I told it yet to downloading the file from macromedia, but after apt-get has completed, I still see no new plugins in the mozilla or firefox plugin directories or in /usr/lib/flashplugins-nonfree and flash still doesn't work in firefox.  What's going on?
[05:55] <dooglus> brush01uk: then line 07 also worked.  that made your slave visible on /mnt instead.  since your slave doesn't have a directory called 'infokeep', line 08 failed
[05:56] <dooglus> brush01uk: then line 18 mounted your slave for a 3rd time
[05:56] <elriah> I'm going to try the 7184 driver...
[05:56] <dooglus> brush01uk: line 21 mounted it for the 4th time

[05:57] <dooglus> brush01uk: see line 50 though?  that tells me that your slave drive was already mounted on /media/hdb1 all along.
[05:57] <jrib> bayzider: a couple of ways.  You can just edit your launcher to use that command instead of just 'firefox'  or put  "export BLAHBLAHBLAH=1" in your ~/.gnomerc (and this will take effect next time you start gnome)

[06:01] <jrib> bayzider: looks like a typo, but now that I think about it, it's better to just put it in /usr/bin/firefox (since in ~/.gnomerc it would affect all of your programs)
[06:01] <dooglus> brush01uk: formal documentation is available if you run "man mount", but it's a tad heavy.  all you need to do is navigate to "filesystem" in the ubuntu file browser, then go to "media" and then "hdb1" and you'll see your files

[06:02] <bean> dooglus, ok thanks
[06:02] <jrib> bayzider: sudo nano -w /usr/bin/firefox .  After the comments at the top, but before any code, just write:  export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1

[06:04] <CupOfSquirrels> Hello, need some quick help with installing Xubuntu (Linux Newbie): I have used the alternate edgy CD to install in text mode (the livecd froze during loading all the time). Everything was fine until getting to the "select and install software" install, where I constantly got an error at 6%. I have install the basic kernel and command line.
[06:04] <bayzider> jrib: ok after thast what do I use for the firefox command?
[06:04] <LjL> bean, if there's that many bug reports that mention that error message, my sense of smell says it's a software problem
[06:04] <jrib> bayzider: same as before
[06:05] <CupOfSquirrels> Basically, I need some help with installing the GUI and/or other software.
[06:05] <jrib> 'firefox'
[06:05] <bean> lol thanks guys
[06:05] <dooglus> CupOfSquirrels: do you have net connectivity?

[06:06] <bean> but it always reaches when i switch to tty1 when the ubuntu splashscreen is shown

[06:08] <dooglus> slavik, CupOfSquirrels: isn't there some way of getting the CD to check itself when you first boot it?  like one of the menu options is "check cd"?

[06:10] <Grem> hey
[06:10] <vega__> I've installed WINE, but now I can't figure out how to use it.
[06:10] <Madhouze> can anybody help me a bit?
[06:10] <vega__> Any help?
[06:10] <dooglus> !ask | Madhouze
[06:10] <ubotu> Madhouze: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:10] <leonel> wine  your.exe
[06:10] <Madhouze> vega-, just run an windows executable and it should take over
[06:10] <bean> LjL, dooglus thx for your help
[06:10] <vega__> You mean just double click one?
[06:10] <dooglus> bean: np
[06:11] <alwa> vega_: or in commandline write winefile
[06:11] <bean> looks like it's software alright
[06:11] <bean> i'll figure out how to file a bug report sometime
[06:11] <alwa> then you get a filemanager (graphic)
[06:11] <vega__> well i got the GUI
[06:11] <vega__> hopefully now i can figure out how to use it on my own
[06:11] <Madhouze> ok- i am running edgy eft with beryl installed - having the following problem: when i start my system, all windows have no frame, no titlebar and no close maximise and minimize buttons
[06:11] <johannes83> any finnish people here i need some help =?
[06:11] <Madhouze> also, shortcut keys do no function
[06:12] <ivan> Hi all
[06:12] <dooglus> Madhouze: there's a channel for XGL questions.  I forget what it's called though.
[06:12] <alwa> vega_: good luck I've had some difficulties running prgs -but installing was noproblem
[06:12] <Madhouze> i then usually open a terminal and run beryl-manager to take over the windows manager and then its ok
[06:12] <mc__> Grem, np
[06:12] <dooglus> !beryl
[06:12] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[06:12] <Grem> :)
[06:12] <Grem> !fluxbox
[06:12] <ubotu> fluxbox is a lightweight and responsive window manager for GNU/Linux. For how to set it up and more information see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fluxbox
[06:12] <Madhouze> i am not sure if its an XGL problem- it seems more like a general ubuntu problem, let me expand
[06:13] <quiet> why in the hell does postfix require X11?
[06:13] <Madhouze> also- i cannot add any program to my session startup- every time i add something, it will disappear the next time i restart my system
[06:13] <timbobsteve> hi all
[06:13] <Madhouze> and when i try to run full screen programs- games or video, my ubuntu gets stuck.
[06:13] <Tenshi> can anyone tell me what the "MonitorLayout" options do (specifically) in the xorg.conf file?
[06:13] <Madhouze> and my screen goes off
[06:13] <ivan> Since I've updated to edgy, i have this annoying bug : whenever i kill X server with Ctrl+Backspace, X server restarts, but gnome doesn't. (plays intro sound, but no splash, nothing more happens)
[06:14] <ivan> Can nyone help ?
[06:14] <collin> I am writing a research paper on linux security, specifically dealing with viruses. How would I compromise the linux security system?
[06:14] <unperson> Ok, so I'm trying to install macromedia flash following the official instructions; however, when I issue the command "sudo update-flashplugin" it says, "automatic installation failed due to network problems or upstream change."  Any idea what's going on and/or how I can fix it?
[06:14] <Madhouze> dooglus, any idea?
[06:14] <timbobsteve> ivan: I thought that GDM would automatically restart after X is killed... gnome shouldn't though... only GDM
[06:15] <timbobsteve> ivan: do you know if GDM is running after you kill X?
[06:15] <ivan> timbobsteve, Yeah, sorry, gdm restarts, but symptoms i descriebed happen when i actually log in
[06:15] <alwa> unperson: have you tried installing flash-plugin with automatix?
[06:15] <LjL> !automatix
[06:15] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[06:15] <alwa> ok :)
[06:15] <vega-> alwa: ?
[06:15] <vega__> Whoever gave me the winefile command, thanks a lot.
[06:15] <slavik> LjL: I filed the bug report, would you like to read it?
[06:16] <unperson> collin, I think there is a lot of literature out on the net on linux security.  If nothing else, there are sites that list current and past exploits.  Those would probably be much better resources than IRC.
[06:16] <alwa> vega_ : np :)
[06:16] <ivan> timbobsteve, well it restarts...
[06:16] <timbobsteve> ivan: ahhh. perhaps it is resetting your session. Try selecting a new session from the GDM menu... or perhaps killing X corrupted your saved session... can't be sure though
[06:16] <vega__> Exploits?  In linux?  unheard of =P
[06:16] <LjL> slavik: sure
[06:16] <unperson> alwa, No.  For the moment I'm steering clear of automatix.

[06:17] <unperson> What I really don't get is I think I followed the same instructions on my other install of dapper and it worked fine.
[06:17] <timbobsteve> ivan: don't think you can.... unless you hand-edit the session file... try starting a different session. Perhaps the default session or the TWM session
[06:17] <scythe128> wow, that answered a couple of questions.. hehe
[06:17] <alwa> unperson: I think you can also download the flash-file from macromedia

[06:18] <timbobsteve> has anyone heard of a dist-upgrade to edgy forgetting to install Xorg ?
[06:18] <vega__> Reboot fixes all problems.
[06:18] <slavik> LjL: you have sudo, too, right?
[06:18] <LjL> slavik: sudo, yes, just not gksudo
[06:18] <ivan> timbobsteve, But the strange thing is that it will play the intro sound, which means gnome is starting, no ?
[06:18] <vega__> Forgetting to install xorg?  That's bad.
[06:18] <scythe128> quiet, that a bash quote?
[06:18] <vega__> That will make beginenrs think linux is no good.
[06:18] <slavik> LjL: does sudo have a daemon running?
[06:18] <pder> does ubuntu have support for input devices such as keyboards?  i am interested in install ubuntu but it is unclear on if i can use a keyboard to enter text into my computer system.
[06:18] <quiet> scythe128, no?
[06:19] <vega__> LOL pder
[06:19] <timbobsteve> ivan: No... GDM is the thing that plays the login sounds... its a common missconception
[06:19] <LjL> slavik: i really don't think
[06:19] <timbobsteve> vega__: tell me about it :P
[06:19] <ivan> timbobsteve, both of the intro sounds ?
[06:19] <vega__> yes pder, ubuntu works fine with keyboards.
[06:19] <timbobsteve> vega__: it left the old xorg on there though....
[06:19] <unperson> alwa, Yup.  I think that's the next step probably.
[06:19] <scythe128> quiet, i think i saw something like that on bash, thats all
[06:19] <quiet> scythe128, oh.. i dunno... i haven't been to bash in ages.
[06:19] <timbobsteve> ivan: yes i think so. As far as I am aware GNOME has no startup sounds. The login and logoff sounds are both handled by GDM
[06:19] <scythe128> hehe
[06:19] <collin> i created a new admin user account, but I can't run any of the admin programs? Why?

[06:20] <bean> how can i get edgy to display what it's loading in the splash screen?
[06:20] <slavik> collin: he in the admin group (new user)?
[06:20] <ivan> timbobsteve, I think gnome does have start sounds : system -> preferences -> sounds. I configured a file to play on startup there, and it does...
[06:21] <collin> slavik: yes, it's in the admin group
[06:21] <dooglus> Madhouze: no idea, sorry.  I never tried any of this new-fangled wobbliness
[06:21] <timbobsteve> ivan: hmmmm... ok... well... I still think that the sounds you are hearing are the GDM sounds.
[06:21] <slavik> ivan: maybe it's a gdm config utility
[06:21] <collin> slavik: I can't even use the network setting application
[06:21] <timbobsteve> slavik: nah the sounds for GDM are setup through "login window" under systen->

[06:22] <bean> oh wow LjL
[06:22] <ivan> timbobsteve, could be... but it still is a very strange issue. I'll try killing X now and logging under an other session...

[06:24] <scythe128> close to what you said, and very much the same principal
[06:24] <curuxz> gyop>> apt-get install alien
[06:24] <ivan> timbobsteve, dammit, here i am, under xfce
[06:24] <curuxz> then use that program to run rpm's?
[06:24] <bean> Skyrail, doesn't seem like it
[06:25] <curuxz> or rather convert them :)
[06:25] <quiet> scythe128, indeed....  i wonder if it's a freenode quote..
[06:25] <LjL> !rpm | curuxz
[06:25] <ubotu> curuxz: rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[06:25] <timbobsteve> ivan: I guess forcefully killing X is corrupting your Gnome session
[06:25] <gyop> i have rpm file. but i want to install from terminal
[06:25] <scythe128> i have never had alien ruin anything
[06:25] <timbobsteve> ivan: you shouldn't really ever need to kill Xorg... it is a nasty way to exit
[06:25] <Skyrail> bean: heh, looks like they are busy, do you know anything about apache/firewalls etc?
[06:25] <bean> anyway guys, if u ever need to access your boot error msgs, just type 'sudo cat /dev/vcs1' in a terminal
[06:25] <curuxz> ailen works well :)
[06:25] <ivan> timbobsteve, i know, but i mess around with wine a lot...
[06:25] <bean> Skyrail, nope heh
[06:25] <LjL> gyop: alien runs from terminal. what program it is anyway? you should avoid that if possible.
[06:25] <scythe128> gyop sudo apt-get install alien && alien -i (your rpm)
[06:26] <Skyrail> bean ah well
[06:26] <ivan> timbobsteve, and somtimes it just is the easiest way to kill wine
[06:26] <timbobsteve> ivan: try setting up a second X session and running all your wine apps on that... no window manager will also give some good performance
[06:26] <gyop> LjL: the latest version of gaim's rpm. i downloaded. but i dont know how can i execute on terminal

[07:00] <Skyrail> pybe: how do I restart it, and what does it do?
[07:00] <The_Machine> How do i back up Ubuntu?  :)
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[07:00] <pybe> __Ace__,  type 'locate myfil.pl

[07:00] <soundray> The_Machine: yes
[07:00] <The_Machine> :)
[07:00] <The_Machine> perfect.
[07:01] <soundray> The_Machine: consider partimage as well
[07:01] <bunnythebunny> This ubuntu looks neat.
[07:01] <__Ace__> well, its at /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl

[07:01] <soundray> The_Machine: partitions
[07:01] <__Ace__> its found, since opera wanna dl it, but I want it to be executed
[07:01] <The_Machine> cool.
[07:01] <The_Machine> :D
[07:01] <Skyrail> pybe: what will that do?
[07:02] <pybe> Skyrail, turn off the iptables firewall on the machine
[07:02] <The_Machine> soundray: what do you like more, sbackup or partimage?
[07:02] <The_Machine> like, this is my work computer

[07:04] <pybe> __Ace__, seems ok... you got apache perl installe?

[07:07] <Almindor> how do I reinstall something properly?

[07:07] <Almindor> I tried "remove" and "install" but it didn't recreate the config files even if I removed them manualy in between
[07:07] <__Ace__> #!/usr/bin/perl

[07:07] <dv5237> whats a good CLI music player?
[07:08] <Legion> I'm studying computer science, and the hell of trying to find a C compiler that'll work under WinXP is simply pissing me off
[07:08] <scythe128> gcc might, thats what xp was compiled on :)
[07:08] <__Ace__> hmm, seems perl is not there.. at /usr/local/perl
[07:08] <roryy> Almindor: to remove config files, use 'remove --purge' to remove config files too.  Read 'man apt-get' for more
[07:08] <roryy> Legion: have you tried cygwin ?

[07:27] <SimiGodBeOs> it not seem to ring the number for me
[07:27] <Legion> I think I better start out with Ubuntu and become comfortable with Linux before I start doing relatively insane stuff hehe

[08:06] <munim> bunnythebunny check the wvdial.conf file for the speed
[08:06] <boodzut> yo what is ubuntu netstat command to just see active connections?
[08:06] <boodzut> netstat -?
[08:06] <samtron02> hola
[08:07] <plantperson_> can someone help me with a build?
[08:07] <bunnythebunny> munim where is wvdial?
[08:07] <munim> /etc/wvdial.conf
[08:07] <keeb> plantperson_: build what
[08:07] <bunnythebunny> Thank you
[08:07] <plantperson_> I'm trying to compile gnome-cpufreq-applet
[08:07] <samtron02> same body from spain???
[08:07] <xopher> munim, your /etc/apt/sources.list is like it should be?
[08:07] <niekie> boodzut, do you mean something like "netstat --tcp --udp"?
[08:07] <boodzut> oh thanks
[08:08] <niekie> No problem :)
[08:08] <plantperson_> it's getting hung up at libpanelapplet
[08:08] <munim> hmm.. what should it be like?
[08:08] <Sp4rKy> hi
[08:08] <niekie> boodzut, to furter extend, you probably could add --raw too ;)
[08:08] <Sp4rKy> i would some information about a possible security bug
[08:08] <niekie> Shows up opened sockets in raw mode too, I think.
[08:09] <Sp4rKy> one my computer, when /etc/fstab isn't set correctly, Ubuntu start a root shell at boot time
[08:09] <Sp4rKy> is it normal ?
[08:09] <niekie> --ax25 --ipx and --netrom are also possible.
[08:09] <Sp4rKy> the root shell is immediatly started, without password prompt
[08:09] <munim> xopher.. in the end its deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)] / breezy main restricted
[08:09] <trippleduce> my xorg is down, and i am stuck in terminal, how do i switch to root?
[08:09] <bunnythebunny> munim, theres not much in wvdial.conf.
[08:10] <neighborlee> trippleduce, you can reconfigbure it with : dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:10] <pjay_> any1 up for helping me install my gfx card?
[08:10] <somerville32> trippleduce: Type: startx
[08:10] <bunnythebunny> munim, i guess i could fill it up....but it only asks me to put my username, password and phone in it...
[08:10] <xopher> munim, dont you have any internet repositories in it?
[08:10] <somerville32> bunnythebunny: What are you trying to do?
[08:11] <trippleduce> somerville fatal error, no screens found
[08:11] <munim> nope.......... but isn't loading the ones from the cds itself
[08:11] <bunnythebunny> My internet is slow...and i want to find out whats wrong..
[08:11] <bunnythebunny> somerville32
[08:11] <somerville32> trippleduce: Has X ever worked for you?
[08:11] <trippleduce> neighbotlee, tried to reconfig already, just want to switchto the backup file instead
[08:11] <xopher> munim, well try adding some repositories, dont know why it doesnt work from the cd though, you sure its on the cD?
[08:11] <Sp4rKy> PLEASE
[08:11] <Sp4rKy> one my computer, when /etc/fstab isn't set correctly, Ubuntu start a root shell at boot time
[08:11] <munim> bunnythebunny if you internet has just become slow, i don't think it could be wvdial.conf's fault.. my stupid guess
[08:11] <bunnythebunny> It was normal in xp a few hours back..
[08:12] <somerville32> sp, whats the problem?
[08:12] <somerville32> !ipv6
[08:12] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[08:12] <somerville32> !tell bunnythebunny about ipv6
[08:12] <bunnythebunny> munim heh :P
[08:12] <indianaj> hi. when i turn on pc it says to me that i need to edit a file with my ip address. how can i do that?
[08:12] <trippleduce> somerville, yes, and i backed up xorg, incase i killed it, which i did, and now i dont have permissions to switch it to teh backed up file
[08:12] <munim> its the Ubuntu 5.10 cd!
[08:13] <neighborlee> trippleduce, sudo mv xorg.conf.bak xorg.conf
[08:13] <munim> so must i load the repos from the internet everytime i wan't to install something?
[08:13] <trippleduce> ah
[08:13] <indianaj> how can i edit files?
[08:13] <neighborlee> trippleduce, as I say whatever you named the backup ;)
[08:13] <munim> indianaj, "vi /path/tofile"
[08:13] <Legion> I have an external harddrive. Will I be able to simply plug that in and then be able to use it?
[08:13] <indianaj> ok thanks
[08:14] <boodzut> can anyone show me a FTP config of vsftpd or something, where it is set to read ftp accounts by user accounts thats on the linux box and that gives each user access to there home directory

[08:14] <thespore> How do I get rid of the login screen that comes up after screensaver?  (on Dapper)
[08:14] <fusionxn1> Hey everyone, can anyone tell me if i will see a differance in performance if i convert my ntfs drives to fat32? I only used them for watching movies
[08:15] <Noah0504> I just did a default LAMP install from the Ubuntu 6.06 server disc.  Is everything already configured, or do I need to configure somethings manually?
[08:15] <fusionxn1> use*
[08:15] <mc__> fusionxn1, not really while watching videos
[08:15] <LjL> fusionxn1: performance, probably not much. reliability, yes
[08:15] <mc__> fusionxn1, copying files and so on will get notably faster
[08:15] <trippleduce> somerville, and neighborlee, THANK YOU
[08:15] <munim> thespore its there in the screensaver options in Preferences in System.. "Lock screen"
[08:15] <mc__> fusionxn1, fat32 also has a 4gb file limit,which might be a problem with large videos
[08:16] <thespore> munim, i don't have a 'screensaver' option in preferences :/
[08:16] <fusionxn1> Well I want to use ubuntu again even tho some of my hardware is not supported yet and just incase i want to come back to winodws i dont want to have to convert them back
[08:16] <fusionxn1> What do you recommend i so. The drives are mainly storage only
[08:16] <munim> huh.. you sure? i have one! ubuntu 5.10
[08:16] <fusionxn1> and watching movies etc
[08:16] <thespore> munim, positive i'm on 6.06
[08:17] <munim> hmm.. then maybe you have to install the package... or its just missing from the menu for some reason
[08:18] <ciaron> why is server still at 6.06?
[08:18] <thespore> well, the reason i need to get rid of it is because i'm in the process of upgrading to edgy-eft.. and I have to leave this workstation unlocked so that someone else can finish the upgrade after I leave
[08:18] <thespore> being that apt is in use.. i can't install any packages
[08:18] <hesperia> hi
[08:19] <hesperia> in xchat all my prive messages are being "attached" on the main channel and not on a seperate tab. what can i do?
[08:19] <fusionxn1> So should I convert to FAT32? I use the drives for storage and watching videos and I dont think i will see any differance will i?
[08:20] <pjay_> how do i log into a shell without x running?
[08:20] <shirish> hi all
[08:20] <munim> okay.. any programmers out there..... where can i get LEX and YACC for ubuntu?
[08:20] <bunnythebunny> somerville32: I edited the file, but i got this on the terminal "(gedit:5102): GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:

[08:21] <stathisx> hi all!
[08:21] <bunnythebunny> hey
[08:21] <Khamael> is there an ubuntu repo with the newest nvidia drivers?
[08:21] <stathisx> how can i nstall ati drivers with apt-get install/
[08:21] <munim> pjay.. start the system with single as argument...
[08:21] <tirta> pjay: change your /etc/inittab to runlevel 2, and restart
[08:21] <munim> the init 2
[08:21] <cuddlebug> i just ran the installer and it said it could prepare enough space
[08:21] <munim> then install the driver
[08:21] <shirish> I have upgraded/updated from ubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 now how do I reflect the change in ubuntu forums?
[08:22] <stathisx> how can i nstall ati drivers with apt-get install/
[08:22] <munim> either what i said or tirta.. both will work :-)
[08:22] <pjay_> i have n idea how to do that
[08:22] <w30> pjay_, stop X from running "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
[08:23] <pjay_> ty
[08:23] <roryy> 2 is the default runlevel anyway ;)

[08:24] <Hyzorz> I have a quick question: Why do my windows lag when I drag them? Or when I scroll?
[08:24] <shirish> I know there is a place where I can change from ubuntu 6.06 to ubuntu 6.10 where is tht place?
[08:24] <roryy> shirish: you wish to know how to upgrade?

[08:25] <shirish> my issue is how do I reflect the change in ubuntuforums where im still listed as a 6.06 user
[08:25] <variant> shirish: who cares?
[08:25] <roryy> shirish: maybe ask on #ubuntuforums
[08:26] <tirta> :)
[08:26] <Hyzorz> I have a quick question: Why do my windows lag when I drag them? Or when I scroll? How do I fix them?
[08:26] <shirish> thnx guys didnt know there was a #ubuntuforums also :)
[08:26] <Dralid> I downloaded a program stepmania (there is no package for it) and it works fine, but it is on my desktop. Where in the linux filesystem *should* I place my program? and what steps should I take so that other users can use this program?
[08:26] <munim> oh.. there is an ubuntuforums channel?
[08:26] <ifireball> Hyzorz: quick question, but slow answer, proformance is a complex issue...
[08:26] <roryy> Hyzorz: you can minimize the graphical effects
[08:26] <Hyzorz> I can run F.E.A.R almost maxed...
[08:27] <ciaron> is there a tool for ubuntu to make 2 disks apear as one?
[08:27] <shirish> another question while im here, im getting error 17 in GRUB, its a dual-boot machine wht can I do to make it right?
[08:27] <cuddlebug> when i try to partition it says it couldnt prepare enough space what do i do?
[08:27] <munim> there is a linux version of FEAR????
[08:27] <Hyzorz> No
[08:27] <Hyzorz> I'm new to linux, that was on Windows
[08:27] <Khuno`> bonjour !
[08:27] <bunnythebunny> munim, if there is, tell me where :D
[08:27] <munim> shirish: try editing menu.lst
[08:27] <pjay_> the shell is barely readable, resolution is all wrong, and i think it said i need some extra packages but i couldnt read what they where :'
[08:27] <tirta> what is FEAR? a game?
[08:27] <derek_> what is fear?
[08:28] <munim> no no there isn't........ sorry!!!! :-)
[08:28] <bunnythebunny> :(
[08:28] <Hyzorz> http://whatisfear.com/us/
[08:28] <oht> tirta: excellent question...that touches the foundations of metaphysics and psychology
[08:28] <oht> ;)
[08:28] <derek_> quick question, I just downloaded Danger in the Deep, a sub sim, it is a bin file , how do I install it?
[08:28] <boodzut> who here has there ftp setup to read linux user accounts and to give each user access to there /homer/user/ directory
[08:28] <Khuno`> ahahahaaa ..
[08:28] <Hyzorz> So what could the problem be if it is not my system?
[08:29] <bunnythebunny> Why is my authentication being rejected when i do this  "gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list". its dumb, i can write the file, but....my authentication is rejected.
[08:29] <tirta> the only multiplayer game i play is world of warcraft, lol
[08:29] <shirish> munim, when I cant run grub how do u suppose I get access to menu.lst?
[08:29] <neildarlow> boodzut: do you mean chroot?
[08:29] <pjay_> any ideas why the text on my screen goes funky when i stop x?
[08:29] <boodzut> eildarlow yes
[08:29] <shirish> it runs upto grub 1.5 & then shows error 17
[08:29] <munim> yaaay! my synaptics is working!!!!!
[08:29] <boodzut> neildarlow yes i ment
[08:29] <neildarlow> boodzut: specify the user's home directory as /home/../username
[08:29] <curdledvomit2> re all
[08:30] <Hyzorz> pjay, if you have a LCD, just leave the auto ajust open and reajust after it runs off the screen
[08:30] <derek_> lol w30
[08:30] <munim> oops.. you can't run grub?
[08:30] <munim> meaning you can't boot?
[08:30] <boodzut> neildarlow how can i set a ftp to when i create a new linux user account that ftp reads it and makes ftp access to that users directory
[08:30] <shirish> thts right munim :)
[08:30] <curdledvomit2> can you do a hard drive install with ubuntu?
[08:30] <bunnythebunny> Why is my authentication being rejected when i do this  "gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list". its dumb, i can write the file, but....my authentication is rejected.
[08:31] <pjay_> when i boot without x i the resolution goes all wrong and i cant read text the shell displays, any ideas what i can do to sort this?
[08:31] <shirish> grub runs to a point & then gives error 17
[08:31] <cuddlebug> guys when i try to install, when i partition, it says it cant prepare enough free space, what do i do?
[08:31] <Ayabara> gahh. I had to reinstall on my computer, and lost a patch for my Inspiron Laptop. It made the speaker and headphone volumes into one, and there was a oneliner to fix it. ring a bell for anyone?
[08:31] <neildarlow> boodzut: the ftp daemon consults the user's login record anyway
[08:31] <munim> shirish: hmmm i really don't know... trying booting from the cd.. maybe there is a recover(?)
[08:31] <bunnythebunny> cuddlebug, do you have free partition space?
[08:31] <boodzut> neildarlow what ftp server would you say to use?
[08:31] <munim> or re-install
[08:31] <ifireball> boodzut: FTP servers on UNIX ususally act like that be default
[08:31] <derek_> anyone know how to install a program that has been packed in a bin file?
[08:31] <neildarlow> boodzut: those instructions were for the vanilla linux ftpd
[08:32] <Hyzorz> I have a second question: How do I finish the install of Wine on a 64bit install? The last step fails...
[08:32] <cuddlebug> i have no idea
[08:32] <curdledvomit2> bunny, yes but i wanted to do a clean install. XP is loaded atm
[08:32] <pjay_> when i boot without x i the resolution goes all wrong and i cant read text the shell displays, any ideas what i can do to sort this?
[08:32] <Hyzorz> pjay, re-allign your minitor
[08:32] <boodzut> neildarlow know any ftp servers that runs like this by default and hardly no configing to it?
[08:32] <neildarlow> boodzut: ftp isn't something i offer these days. i prefer to use sftp (provided by sshd)
[08:32] <tirta> i'm totally new to GUI linux, anyone can recommend me how to access the GUI remotely? with VNC maybe? any links or whatever?
[08:33] <bunnythebunny> curdledvomit2,  well im a newb at this but...you need partition space.
[08:33] <curdledvomit2> bunny, yes but i wanted to do a clean install. XP is loaded atm
[08:33] <Hyzorz> I have a second question: How do I finish the install of Wine on a 64bit install? The last step fails...
[08:33] <curdledvomit2> lol sry
[08:33] <w30> derek_, chmod ugoa+x thebinfile then just type the path and name of the bin file and press enter
[08:33] <derek_> has anyone here ever installed a program that was packed into a bin file?
[08:33] <derek_> thanks
[08:33] <bunnythebunny> curdledvomit2, heh no problem, you need to get a thing like partition wizard.
[08:33] <neildarlow> boodzut: i'd suggest checking the repository for what's available to ubuntu
[08:33] <linuxboy> and ideas how I can install flash 8 on edgy?
[08:33] <curdledvomit2> well i have partition space
[08:34] <oht> derek: lol, if no one's answered you the first two times i don't think you'll have much luck :P  try google

[08:34] <Dralid> Where should program files be placed? In windows they were located at the convenient "Program Files" folder. Is there an equivalent in linux?
[08:34] <bunnythebunny> curdled, then there shouldnt be any problem. If that partition space in unnalocated.
[08:34] <bunnythebunny> is*
[08:34] <curdledvomit2> well how do i get to that point on the cd?
[08:34] <curdledvomit2> to install it
[08:34] <ifireball> Hyzorz: I din't think that is actually a version of wine that will properly work in 64bit, you can compile it, but it won't work
[08:34] <curdledvomit2> i have the live cd
[08:35] <bunnythebunny> To what point do you get?
[08:35] <neildarlow> Dralid: is this for stuff not installed by .deb packages?
[08:35] <tirta> i need help from anyone who can remotely access ubuntu' GUI
[08:35] <curdledvomit2> to install to the HD
[08:35] <Hyzorz> Yeah, I followed the stept on http://wiki.winehq.org/WineOn64bit#head-15ce773b2453307f593a3045e558b30a0e8ed64d
[08:35] <pip> does gaim have a speedlimit on 2,5KB/s or something? if someone send me a file on gaim/msn it DLs in ~2,5KB/s if i get 2 files both DL in ~2,5KB/s
[08:35] <w30> Dralid, If you are installing a tar file and compiling I recomment mkdir /usr/local/newprogramname and put it in there.
[08:36] <curdledvomit2> thanks for the help <3
[08:36] <bunnythebunny> Have you tried to go manual and see for yourself the free partition space? You need 2gb minimum, i think. And it really has to be free..as in...no fat32, no nfts, no format whatsoever.
[08:36] <bunnythebunny> uuh.. lol.
[08:36] <Lynoure> tirta: Depends on whose ubuntu, but people generally use vnc or some variant of it for remote desktop access.
[08:37] <Hyzorz> After I followed those steps, it just said ./configure didn't exist
[08:37] <derek_> w30: humm....I must be stupid I can't get that to work
[08:37] <Dralid> neildarlow: no deb package exists for the program I'm trying to install. (Stepmania)
[08:37] <neildarlow> Dralid: then /usr/local/bin is a likely candidate
[08:37] <tirta> Lynoure: any url for some guide on it? and is there any other option other than VNC?
[08:37] <derek_> w30:  can't I just double click it and have it run?
[08:37] <ifireball> Dralid: essentially binary program files should reside somewhere under "/usr" while localy compiled packages should be seperated from the ones that come with the distro by being in /usr/local; do note that the system is designed to allow the entire /usr tree to be read-only so don't put any configuration files there
[08:38] <Lynoure> tirta: kubuntu comes with a tool for that installed, probably ubuntu also (but I do not know its name for ubuntu)
[08:38] <w30> Dralid, most programs do some placing of their own when installed, A .deb program does all of it placing and you can throw away the .deb after install if you don't want a copy of the installer file
[08:38] <neildarlow> Dralid: but if you run its configure for /usr/local it will probably populate various directories under there
[08:38] <boodzut> neildarlow can vsftpd do i what im talking about
[08:38] <Lynoure> Dralid: it should be easy, I have instructions for dapper somewhere
[08:38] <neildarlow> boodzut: i think it does.
[08:38] <tirta> thanks, gonna check the manual if they're inside ubuntu archive
[08:38] <Hyzorz> is x64 worth the trouble if I am going to be running WINE?
[08:39] <pip> does gaim have a speedlimit on 2,5KB/s or something? if someone send me a file on gaim/msn it DLs in ~2,5KB/s if i get 2 files both DL in ~2,5KB/s
[08:39] <palski> when I try to start hal-device-manager following error message is shown:  Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory
[08:39] <Hyzorz> pip, that's a router/port problem
[08:39] <Lynoure> tirta: there might be something titled Desktop Sharing under the Internet part of the menu
[08:39] <neildarlow> palski: then dbus isn't running before hal is started
[08:39] <oht> s/someone/somewhat :P
[08:39] <ifireball> Hyzorz: unless you gonna be running something like ORACLE, x64 isn't yet worth the trouble period.
[08:40] <Hyzorz> Okay, so I should download and install 32bit instead?
[08:40] <w30> derek_, Linux files need permission to execute because of the way security and user seperation is facillicated.
[08:40] <Hyzorz> especially being a linux noob?
[08:40] <ifireball> Hyzorz: I think so
[08:40] <oht> Hyzorz: yeah, i would stick with 32
[08:40] <Hyzorz> okay, thanks :)
[08:40] <oht> i haven't noticed a big speed difference *at all* between 64 and 32
[08:40] <derek_> w30: okay...........so what do I do?
[08:40] <palski> neildarlow: there is a dbus-daemon and dbus-launch runniing
[08:41] <ifireball> oht: that's because as far as desktop applications go, most of them can't take advantage of 64bit at all
[08:41] <edgy__> oht: you won't see speed difference in normal applications but you may notice it if you compile the kernel e.g or encoded video or audio
[08:41] <Lynoure> Dralid: check http://www.tfbw.com/dancegames/stepmania/linux/installation/ if you have not already

[08:42] <w30> derek_, to run a bin file in a terminal type chmod ugoa+x thefile.bin. After that type /path/of/file/file.bin and hit enter
[08:42] <pip> my hdd tells me it doesnt recognice it and it needs to write some data files to it
[08:43] <Lynoure> pip: if you do it that way, you'll prolly need to reinstall grup afterwards
[08:43] <pip> and that is after ive made a new partition
[08:43] <pip> well i dont really want ubuntu anymore, but i cant install xp

[08:44] <pip> so have is happen to you guys before?
[08:44] <ifireball> pip: did you make sure you removed all the linux partitions, also note that XP doesn't seem to like it when it doesn't own the 1st primary partition
[08:44] <derek_> w30: do I start path of file with root?
[08:44] <palski> neildarlow: /etc/init.d/dbus restart fixed the problem, thanks
[08:44] <pip> ive installed xp on that drive many times befpre
[08:45] <pip> yeah it was completely clean
[08:45] <oht> classtime :)
[08:45] <w30> derek_, may sudo is necessary in front of the chmod
[08:45] <pip> and then i clicked C to make a partition
[08:45] <pip> then enter, then enter again to install xo to that partition
[08:45] <pip> xo = xp*
[08:45] <zlack> hey guys - how can i recreate /dev/dsp ?
[08:45] <Lynoure> pip: it's a great opportunity to call a MS helpline
[08:46] <pip> yeah problably
[08:46] <w30> derek_, yeah complete path to keep things simple for now
[08:46] <pip> im asked in some windows channels but they doesnt seem to know what the problem is either
[08:46] <Lynoure> pip: what's the error message?
[08:46] <pip> so i thought maybe it was something that ive had ubuntu installed on it before
[08:47] <ifireball> pip: you can try and create a clean partition table wiyth the linux fdisk
[08:47] <pip> ive translated the error message from swedish and here it is
[08:47] <hoagie> hello pepople
[08:47] <hoagie> people*
[08:47] <Lynoure> pip: I was just about to recommend what ifireball recommended
[08:47] <Seriii> hi ^^
[08:47] <hoagie> can I ask a question?
[08:47] <pip> to install windows xp in the choosen partition the installation program needs to write som start files to the following disk (the disk and some facts)
[08:47] <Lynoure> hoagie: you just did :)
[08:48] <hoagie> then can i ask another one?
[08:48] <pip> ive tried to clean the disk with gparted, and i tried to make a fat32 and NTFS partition on it too as primary partition
[08:48] <fildo> morning
[08:48] <birdfish> Say that I have an external nameserver.  If I'm utilizing masquerading for my internal network, do I require a DNS server in order to forward my external nameserver information?  Or can this be done with a DHCP server or something?
[08:49] <Lynoure> pip: I remember seeing something like that, back in my windows days but that was a warning than just required a keypress to ok
[08:49] <derek_> w30: it says cannot access subsim.bin No such file or directory
[08:49] <janekulk> hi. I have bought a router. It is connected and when I try connect to internet in windows XP everything is ok, but in ubuntu I can't use for example my browser. Although, I can ping www.google.pl. Where is a problem? Maybe firewall?
[08:49] <pip> ok, well mine isnt really an error message. but i can only click enter and then i get back to the partition window
[08:49] <Lynoure> pip: just remove all partitions, no need to make new ones
[08:49] <derek_> w30: do I start the path with /home/derek/installers?
[08:50] <pip> yeah but it still doesnt work =/
[08:50] <tonquin> so i just started using ubuntu edgy.  and now i'm trapped in it.
[08:50] <tonquin> i need help to get out.
[08:50] <hoagie> My problem is about the gnome panels. I made my panel solid black, but when I add an applet on the panel, it always has a white background. This happens whith every colour
[08:50] <pip> and btw anyone know if you choose which kind of filesystem the partition should be when you make it or when you format it and install windows on it?
[08:50] <pip> since when im making a partition i ca only choose the size of it
=== Webby is now known as W3bby
[08:51] <savvas> niven.freenode.net:ircd ESTABLISHED - does anyone know where it is stated that 6667 is named as ircd port?
[08:51] <ifireball> pip: if all esle fails wipe the partition table clean with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=4" (quite destructive), windows install should be able to create a new one
[08:52] <CupOfSquirrels> Euch, me again: I think I've been able to install the Xubuntu graphical desktop. I'm at the command line, do I just reboot to enter the GUI, or is there a command I can tap in?
[08:52] <tonquin> any help out there?
[08:52] <ifireball> pip: or just low-level fromat from your BIOS
[08:52] <Lynoure> savvas: you mean whether it's in some RFC or something? or in your irc client?
[08:52] <ifireball> CupOfSquirrels: "/etc/init.d/gdm restart" should get you a graphical login
[08:53] <pip> ifireball: ive tried some dd command
[08:53] <Lynoure> tonquin: ask your question, "trapped in it" is a bit vague
[08:53] <pip> dno if it was that but the guy said it would wipe the drive clean
[08:53] <CupOfSquirrels> "Starting GNOME Display manager [fail] " o_o
[08:54] <savvas> Lynoure: i mean whether i can setup in ubuntu netstat to "register" 6668 port as "ircd"
[08:54] <tonquin> well i can't shut down. I can run only a few programs. can't run any command line stuff at all.
[08:54] <ifireball> CupOfSquirrels: but actually, if the install doesn't leave you wuth a gui, there might be something wrong with your xorg.conf
[08:54] <tonquin> i'm looking at a hard reset here.
[08:54] <CupOfSquirrels> Doesn't Xubuntu use xfce anyway?
[08:54] <ifireball> pip: what was it?
[08:54] <tonquin> can't get to a terminal either.
[08:54] <w30> derek_, no, use /home/derek/installers/yourfile.bin or whatever the bin file is named
[08:54] <ciaron> why is server still at 6.06?
[08:54] <pip> it looked similar to you or maybe it was the same, i dont remember
[08:55] <ifireball> CupOfSquirrels: there is no XFCE Display manager so they're using Gnome's
[08:55] <CupOfSquirrels> ok
[08:55] <derek_> w30: I did it I think.......I type it in and hit enter and it returned to the regular prompt.....is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[08:55] <dj_baggio> ...
[08:55] <tonquin> thank goodness for chatzilla :)
[08:56] <Legion> Speaking as a n00b again, anti virus and firewalls for Linux. Any suggestions?
[08:56] <hoagie> I don't think you need one
[08:56] <ifireball> CupOfSquirrels: I suppose you need to go log digging to figure out why GDM doesn't start; also you can try using "startx" to bypass GDM and start a X session as the logged in user
[08:57] <CupOfSquirrels> ifireball: Forgot to add "sudo", my bad. Sorry :<
[08:57] <w30> derek_, probably did run then, a executable does or does not produce console output depending on how the author wrote the program
[08:57] <CupOfSquirrels> Seems to be working atm. Thanks for the command.
[08:57] <derek_> w30: where would it have installed to?
[08:57] <hoagie> btw does anyone knows if theres a way to make the applets on the panels, appear with the same colour the panel is?
[08:57] <ifireball> Legion: anti virus on linux are only used on mailservers to protect windows computers...
[08:57] <tonquin> no one here seen this before?
[08:59] <ifireball> Legion: about firewall, Linux has built-in firewall capability in the kkernel, however configuring it may be a tad hard for a new user, you can probably find recommendation for graphical firewall configuration scripts in the wiki
[08:59] <Legion> I see that Ubuntu has a build in firewall
[08:59] <psusi> Legion: and a firewall is not needed for a typical ubuntu install as it doesn't have any insecure services listening on open ports..
[08:59] <psusi> Legion: no... you can configure one if you wish, but it just isn't needed
[08:59] <w30> derek_, that's a problem with Linux installs, you don't get the name of the executable after the program installs in a menu or icon unless the program wants one. check your documentation for the executable.
[09:00] <Lynoure> savvas: sorry, no idea, I tend to prefer the numerical mode
[09:00] <tonquin> is there no <ctrl><alt><delete>  type function in ubuntu?
[09:00] <psusi> tonquin: sure... it ctrl-alt-del reboots
[09:00] <w30> derek_, what was the name of the program?
[09:00] <Lynoure> tonquin: did you install ubuntu or is it livecd you are on?
[09:01] <derek_> w30: it is danger from the deep, it si a sub simulator
[09:01] <gharz> guys, i'm using sony ericsson m600i... how come the system doesn't detect the memory disc? any idea?
[09:01] <tonquin> psusi: I tried it once...nothing happened... i'll try it again.
[09:01] <Lynoure> tonquin: if latter, feel free to just press the power button if you need to.
[09:01] <ifireball> tonquin: actually, it did work the last tiem I checked, it only takes a while because it brings down your system in an orderly fashion instead of blowing it away
[09:01] <gharz> i'm also using k750i but it can detect memory stick duo
[09:01] <psusi> tonquin: though if you want to reboot, I sugguest using the menu
[09:02] <tonquin> psusu:  the menu pic doesn't work right now
[09:02] <ifireball> tonquin: but is you had X freez on you it may not help becasue X may be freezing the keyboard driver as well
[09:02] <tonquin> and neither does c a d
[09:02] <calabaza> tonquin: once I killed the hotkeys daemon, l... bad idea, lost things like <ctl><alt><del>
[09:02] <w30> derek_, I can't help you there, I am not familiar with that one, chek /usr/games/bin and see if omething in there rings a bell.
[09:02] <psusi> tonquin: how about ctrl-alt-F1?  should take you to a terminal... to get back to X, hit alt- and the left arrow key
[09:03] <tonquin> ok I'll try that.
[09:03] <hoagie> can anyone tell me if there's a way to make the gnome panel applets have the same colour as the panel?
[09:03] <psusi> oh, and you have to use the left alt, not the right alt
[09:03] <gharz> how can i make my ubuntu detect memory stick micro (M2) of my sony ericsson m600i? any idea?
[09:03] <calabaza> tonquin: you may try to kill X with <ctl><alt><bkspc> ... if the kbd works
[09:03] <ifireball> hoagie: they ususally have the same color, what theme are you using?
[09:03] <fourat> anyone know how to disable Ctrl+alt F1..12 shortcuts to console ?
[09:03] <hoagie> tango-noir
[09:04] <hoagie> but the don't the always appear in white
[09:04] <waldek> Siema
[09:04] <waldek> Jak sie oposlugiwac fdisck ?
[09:04] <Lam_> how do i get mozilla-mplayer installed without mplayer or it's associated packages? (i self-compiled my own mplayer)
[09:04] <psusi> fourat: why would you want to?
[09:05] <Lynoure> hoagie: I do not know the specifics, but it's likely that the answer can be found somewhere under http://art.gnome.org/
[09:05] <waldek> Polska
[09:05] <ifireball> Lam_: you don't. that doesn't make any sense.
[09:05] <waldek> Polska
[09:05] <waldek> Polska
[09:05] <hoagie> oooh fixed it was my control's fault
[09:05] <waldek> Jak sie oposlugiwac fdisck ?
[09:05] <waldek> Jak sie oposlugiwac fdisck ?
[09:05] <w30> fourat, disable the keystroke or disable the consoles?
[09:05] <hoagie> really weird gt4 theme
[09:06] <waldek> Polski chat jest jakis ?
[09:06] <Lynoure> !pl > waldek
[09:06] <fourat> w30 both
[09:06] <waldek> ?
[09:07] <calabaza> question: trying to mount a floppy in Nautilus takes forever (seems to be fsck-ing the floppy!) is there a way to fix this?
[09:07] <waldek> ubuntu.pl
[09:07] <gharz> anybody around who access Memory Stick Micro (M2) for sony ericsson phone?
[09:07] <w30> fourat, I disabled mine by an error and did not like the results because console output on boot up has no place to go even though the log files of the boot was created.
[09:08] <w30> fourat, so you really do need one at least.
[09:09] <emfor> hi
[09:10] <dnite> I put together my own init script using the skeleton, but there are 2 things i'm unsure of how to do. Most importantly, I'd like to have the script run at boot, but not as root.. is there a way to do this?
[09:10] <tonquin> thanks ... that did it ... the ctrl alt F1
[09:10] <w30> fourat, if you want none or more than 6 then edit /etc/inittab although Edgy may not have inittab so I can't help if you are on Edgy
[09:10] <Lynoure> emfor: hello
[09:10] <CupOfSquirrels> What "location" are usb ports? Usb[number] ?
[09:10] <tonquin> thought i might have to yank out the battery on this thing to get a reset.
[09:11] <ifireball> dnite: 1st you really need to figure out if you want this as a system deamon or a user damon
[09:11] <tonquin> poor form for 2006
[09:11] <gharz> exit
[09:11] <dnite> ifireball, i want it as a user daemon. it's an irc bot that i don't want to ever look, and i want it to always start up when i boot my computer though...
[09:12] <fourat> w30
[09:12] <emfor> I've got a bit strange question... I'd like to upgrade my 6.06 to 6.10, but I also want to install kde instead of gnome, is it possible to skip upgrading gnome during the upgrade?
[09:12] <MarcN> emfor: remove gnome before upgrading.
[09:12] <tonquin> guess i'll waddle off and find out how to restart gnome .... for next time.
[09:13] <ifireball> dnite: I got an eggdrop running like that, what I did was create a cron job to periodically check if  the bot is online and load it otherwise, the job belongs to a user deddicated to running the bot
[09:13] <melot> #ubuntu
[09:13] <ifireball> dnite: that way you also have some kind of fail-safty for it
[09:13] <melot> hi
[09:14] <emfor> MarcN: ok but I read that it's recomended to use that gnome tool to upgrade...? Can I safely do it without it?
[09:14] <melot> anyone here help me to set up a script that runs multiple programs at the same time?
[09:14] <codingheaven> hey
[09:14] <dnite> ifireball, ah. ok. i'll give that a shot. i initially had it running when i logged in, but then the bot would disconnect every time i restarted X or something..
[09:14] <dcordes> what is the key combination to close a running process while in command line mode?
[09:14] <we2by> nice. now I can install flash via ffox :)
[09:14] <we2by> very nice job done :)
[09:14] <codingheaven> melot, cmd &
[09:15] <calabaza> dcordes, you can try top
[09:15] <melot> oki ill try
[09:15] <ifireball> melot: just suffix that commands you want to run in parralel with "&"
[09:15] <melot> ahh i have done that
[09:15] <melot> it needs to finish the first program tho
[09:15] <melot> then runds the second after
[09:16] <dcordes> calabaza: i don't know the key top :-(
[09:16] <ifireball> dcordes: is the program is taking up your foreground, you can try ctrl+C or ctrl+z to freez it and go to the shell
[09:16] <calabaza> dcordes, not a key, top is a command
[09:16] <dcordes> ifireball: nice. that's what i was looking for. thanks a lot
[09:16] <codingheaven> i am having some troubles with ubuntu kernel on my intel core 2 duo ..the hard drive is allways reading/writing 5 to 5 seconds..anyone has the same problem ?
[09:16] <ifireball> calabaza: top can't kill processes afaik
[09:17] <melot> ahh
[09:17] <melot> thanks guys what i did was &&
[09:17] <codingheaven> that is AND
[09:17] <ifireball> dcordes: note that after ctrl+z the process stays in memory, you can see the list of thos processes with "jobs"
[09:17] <kzm_> Must I do something special to boot a stock ubuntu kernel with NFS-root?  (Everything else is working, I can boot an LTSP kernel this way)
[09:17] <codingheaven> :)
[09:17] <kzm_> Must I recompile?
[09:18] <ifireball> kzm_: basically you have a chicken and egg problem
[09:18] <codingheaven> someone can help me with this issue??..the machine is an acer laptop
[09:18] <ifireball> kzm_: krenel needs network driver to mount root, network driver is a module file in root...
[09:19] <withaY> i can't seem to be able to add a networked HP printer using the gnome-cups-manager.
[09:19] <ifireball> kzm_: this can be solved with an initrd file though, did you configure pxelinux to load it? (also I'm unsure the stock ubuntu initrd image contains network drivers)
[09:19] <calabaza> ifireball, I though you could go interactive with top, press k then kill if you know the PID
[09:19] <kzm_> ifireball, not so - it boots the kernel all right, it justs fails to mount NFS.
[09:20] <melot> now how can i make <prog1> & "delay" <prog2>?
[09:20] <kzm_> Yes, I have an initrd.  I get dropped into it with a message about /dev/nfs not available.
[09:20] <kzm_> melot: prog1 & sleep 10; prog2 ?
[09:20] <melot> 'ok ill try
[09:21] <kzm_> (melot, not sure exactly what you want)
[09:21] <compengi> !seen gnomefreak
[09:21] <ubotu> I last saw gnomefreak (n=gnomefre@ubuntu/member/gnomefreak) 10h 1m 46s ago, quiting: "Lost terminal"
[09:21] <ifireball> kzm_: well, I'm unsure what /dev/nfs is (some new 2.6 kernel trick? i donno); bbut are you sure you have a module for your network card in your initrd?
[09:21] <kzm_> I get "ALERT! /dev/nfs does not exist"
[09:22] <melot> Kzm: is sleep 10 10 sec?
[09:22] <kzm_> ifireball, I think it is a "virtual" thing to tell the kernel to use nfsroot.
[09:22] <kzm_> melot, yes.
[09:22] <melot> thanks
[09:23] <foreverconnected> has anyone else been having trouble with samba and edgy lately?
[09:23] <melot> thanks all guys....it works no
[09:23] <melot> now*
[09:23] <foreverconnected> as in, it's totally busted?
[09:23] <ifireball> kzm_: anycase, 99% of the cases where I hit such problems it was becasue I didn't include the proper NIC driver with the kernel/initrd; can you check that out?
[09:24] <melot> someday ill contribute something :)
[09:24] <kzm_> ifireball, but, but, it gets its IP address and everything.
[09:24] <ifireball> kzm_: can you ping the NFS server when you're in the initrd?
[09:25] <dnite> ifireball, i'm using BitchX as my irc bot server (running it with a -B, so it just quits to the term) .. how would i 'check' to see if that specific instance of BitchX is running?
[09:26] <ifireball> dnite: are you expecting to be running many more BitchX instances?
[09:26] <sparrw> Can anyone verify that Mozilla Thunderbird does [not?]  have its icon in the top left corner of its window when installed from its package?
[09:26] <SneeR> Help me enable 4 chanels on my 5.1 integrated sound card
[09:27] <dnite> ifireball, i might.. maybe one more as a normal client ..
[09:27] <withaY> when adding a printer through the cups browser interface, what does "Unable to copy PPD file!" mean?
[09:28] <SneeR> Who can help me enable 5.1 or 4.0 sound on my  soundcard integrated? or maybee manual or something like that
[09:28] <foreverconnected> Nobody has any info on the Samba bug?
[09:28] <dnite> SneeR, hold on. I found that not too long ago. lemme find the site i used to enable mine...
[09:28] <Legion> How often is Ubuntu updated?
[09:28] <foreverconnected> sparrw: At least in Edgy, the logo that shows up for mozilla products is not the regular one. dunno.
[09:28] <ifireball> dnite: I think "ps" has a "-E" option that makes it output the full command line of the running processes so you can grep on it; consult the manpage (you can actually tell "ps" exactly waht information fields to put in its output)
[09:29] <foreverconnected> Legion: ubintu is updated every single second of every single day
[09:29] <kzm_> ifireball, no ping in /bin.  But I did 'ipconfig', and my if came up fine.
[09:29] <sparrw> foreverconnected: dont care if its regular, just that its anything other than the default X
[09:29] <sp|urr> hi.. ive got edgy on CD but i am getting a panic right at the start of the loading process. i have tried acpi=off pc=off and many combination with bios.. etc. as said in forums. is this a KNOWN BUG?
[09:29] <kzm_> I can't quite figure out the expected sequence of scripts to run, though.
[09:29] <dnite> ifireball, awesome.. thanks alot!
[09:30] <ifireball> kzm_: you can ping the other way around... (from server to client..)
[09:30] <sparrw> found the problem, already-reported bug.
[09:30] <SneeR> dnite Did you find?
[09:31] <dnite> SneeR, i couldn't find it.. but here's what i got.. put this in your ~/.asoundrc
[09:31] <dnite> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31740/
[09:31] <dnite> SneeR,  --^
[09:31] <sp|urr> anybody know about the Live CD crash bug?
[09:31] <dnite> SneeR, just change the nuber of speakers to match yours (the sub is a speaker)
[09:31] <ifireball> kzm_: also if you know how the NFS root kernel compile option is called you can grep for it in your /boot/config-* files to see of the stock kernel includes it
[09:31] <munim> hey i am back
[09:32] <SneeR> dnite thanks I'll try
[09:32] <dnite> SneeR, and change surround71 to surround51.. you should get the idea.
[09:33] <kzm_> ifireball, good point.  (ping is okay, btw)
[09:34] <mumbles> anyone know if i can install urwid ?
[09:34] <mumbles> using apt-get under ubntu ?
[09:34] <Discerer> So how is ubuntu compared to gentoo for a server computer?
[09:34] <sp|urr> anyone?????
[09:34] <sp|urr> hello?
[09:34] <aboutblank> i'm on a home network, and i can't seem to figure out why local network dns doesn't seem to work. i cannot ping my fileserver by its hostname, though i can by its IP. any pointer?
[09:34] <ifireball> Discerer: way more work to setup a gentoo server...
[09:34] <munim> yeah spurrr...
[09:35] <foreverconnected> Discerer: there's a tiny version of ubuntu for servers... think of ubuntu like debian, but nicer.
[09:35] <aboutblank> oh, i AM on a static IP...
[09:35] <keeb> Disc, it's all the same shit with a different wrapper ;)
[09:35] <KaiHanari> aboutblank the Fileserver windows?
[09:35] <aboutblank> KaiHanari: Yes.
[09:35] <Discerer> yeah I've tried ifireball :p can't get the kernel to recognize my network card for like 6 hours :)
[09:35] <ifireball> aboutblank: so its not DNS...
[09:35] <Discerer> thinking of trying ubuntu, heard it's nicer for newbs
[09:35] <KaiHanari> aboutblank thats windows nameing crap, your not in the same workgroup as that system
[09:35] <foreverconnected> nicer for everyone
[09:36] <Blippe> Flash worked for 12 hours, now it just crasches firefox... how do i fix it? (I use flashblock already))
[09:36] <sp|urr> munim: know abt a possibly acpi related crash on live cds (edgy) ?
[09:36] <kzm_> ifireball, a manual mount seems to be working...(it's slow, missing pormapper or something?)
[09:36] <foreverconnected> Discerer: it still has all the same features as every other debian build
[09:36] <kzm_> What's next - chroot and exec init?
[09:36] <SneeR> dnite Should I restart gnome session to enable changes?
[09:36] <foreverconnected> Discerer: it's just packed up nicer, and runs really well. you can do all the same stuff without half the hassle, because there's a lot of nie gui tools
[09:37] <munim> sorry.. haven't tried edgy... but you can try booting with noacpi as argument
=== recon0 is now known as recon
[09:37] <ifireball> kzm_: I have to ask, what parameter did you pass the kernel to tell is to nfs-mount root?
=== recon is now known as recon0
[09:37] <aboutblank> so why can't ubuntu ask my router for the IP of the hostname "fileserver"?
[09:37] <dnite> SneeR, should be immediate
[09:37] <sp|urr> munim: tried that. tried each and every possible combination with the BIOS as well
[09:37] <KaiHanari> aboutblank thats not how that works
[09:37] <foreverconnected> Sooooooooooooo: Does anyone know why Samba won't reinstall on edgy? I'm not the only person with this problem, it's super busted.
[09:37] <sp|urr> Discerer: dont take the word for it...
[09:37] <dnite> SneeR, run speaker-test -c 6
=== Lahey_ is now known as Lahey
=== recon0 is now known as recon
[09:38] <sp|urr> Discerer: ive been on linux for more than 8 years now
[09:38] <KaiHanari> aboutblank the router only knows about IPs for hostnames of outside world stuff, it sees the inside stuff by mac addresses
[09:38] <sp|urr> Discerer: today i tried ubuntu
[09:38] <sp|urr> Discerer: and it fails
[09:38] <foreverconnected> sp|urr: how so?
[09:38] <kzm_> ifireball, tried a few different ones.  Lemme check: append root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=172.30.0.1:/export/golem-root ip=dhcp initrd=initrd.img-2.6.17-10-386 rw noapic --
[09:38] <kzm_> (from pxelinux.cfg/)
[09:38] <KaiHanari> aboutblank, the windows computer names are resolved by a broadcast of some sort, and all the systems reply with their names and shares
[09:38] <foreverconnected> what version are you running? edgy is a little buggy still.
[09:38] <aboutblank> KaiHanari: Er... than how do multiple windows computers do the hostname resolution?
[09:38] <munim> spurr... whts ur mobo n system config?
[09:38] <Discerer> ok sp|urr, how?
[09:38] <aboutblank> i see...
[09:39] <sp|urr> edgy is WAY too buggy
[09:39] <sp|urr> i cant even get the damn thing to boot!
[09:39] <kzm_> aboutblank, multiple window computers?
[09:39] <foreverconnected> sp|urr: I'm typing this from edgy RIGHT now
[09:39] <sp|urr> tried all possible combinations with BIOS acpi off.. acpi=off boot params.. etc  etc
[09:39] <aboutblank> rawrg so how can i ping my fileserver based on hostname?
[09:39] <foreverconnected> sp|urr: so this seems to be a personal problem.
[09:39] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: it works on some yes
[09:39] <kzm_> sp|urr, try 'noapic'?  Worked for me.
[09:39] <munim> hey.. i couldn't get any version of linux to boot with agp enabled on my mobo.. now i just use my onboard card
[09:39] <KaiHanari> aboutblank, there is documentation about getting that to work, look for getting a linux computer on a windows workgroup or the like. ive never done it myself, besides by installing samba on the computer
[09:39] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: at least.. one should fully test before releasing with such hype
=== PHoeNiGoRe is now known as hammer
[09:40] <aboutblank> alright, thanks KaiHanari for the help
[09:40] <ifireball> aboutblank: they use broadcasts, the network equivalent of shouting "who is ____!?"
[09:40] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: ive got it working on one pc.. and it wont boot on the other.. hardware issues yes.. my point is it aint upto the hype
=== hammer is now known as hammer`
[09:40] <munim> still not alll hardware is compatible with linux
[09:40] <nikietta> hello ubuntu
[09:40] <SneeR> dnite I have error's when i ran speaker-test
=== hammer` is now known as PHoeNiGoRe
[09:40] <melot> munim: i have same problem with my asus 815e moterboard
[09:40] <sp|urr> munim: i do fedora and suse on knoppix on the same hardware.. not ubuntu
[09:41] <sp|urr> so my point is
[09:41] <sp|urr> anyone familiar with the problem?
[09:41] <munim> let me guess... you have an AGP card!
[09:41] <melot> yep
[09:41] <foreverconnected> sp|urr: I would think that it's because it's trying to support your hardware better then the other distros do
[09:41] <foreverconnected> and the auto install procedure is hanging up on something it thinks it knows what it is, but is nonstandard, and fails
[09:41] <froggontherocks> i'm thinking about installing ubuntu on my HP Laptop but I don't know if i should use the 64bit or the intel x86 version
[09:42] <heatxsink> is there any reason why mod_headers isn't a package for apache2 in ubuntu?
[09:42] <dnite> SneeR, what errors?
[09:42] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: i hope so
[09:42] <foreverconnected> the installer for ubuntu is very intuitive... and it's a live CD...
[09:42] <keeb> froggontherocks, depends on hardware ;x
[09:42] <foreverconnected> will it boot the live cd?
[09:42] <munim> spurr do you have an agp card?
[09:42] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: it crashes after showing the first progress bar..
[09:42] <froggontherocks> I have an intel T2050 Core duo
[09:42] <ifireball> kzm_: sorry, its been to long since I last did an NFS-mount setup, that looks ok to me, afaik the kernel is supposed to swap the initrd for the real root when initrd exits
[09:42] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: its a gforce fx 5500
[09:43] <munim> oh.. i know this problem......
[09:43] <dnite> SneeR, did you change the channels to 6 and the surround71 to surround51 ?? there should be 2 instances of channels you need to change...
[09:43] <sp|urr> munim: geforce fx 5500
[09:43] <sp|urr> munim: tell me!
[09:43] <sp|urr> munim: i spent hours on this and i got no clue
[09:43] <keeb> froggontherocks, i didnt notice any difference using the 64bit other than a headache
[09:43] <sp|urr> foreverconnected: u havent come across the issue?
[09:43] <munim> well.. if you install it, you should chmod -x /etc/init.d/hotplug and then modify xorg.conf
[09:43] <pippo123> ciao a tutti
[09:43] <ifireball> kzm_: maybe you're just need to add a /dev/nfs device file to your initrd
[09:43] <froggontherocks> Keeb, A headache in what way
[09:43] <SneeR> dnite yes there are a lot of errors
[09:43] <pippo123> qualcuno parla italiano ?
[09:43] <Legion> Seems that the torrent link for 6.10 seems to have disappeared
[09:44] <keeb> compat headaches
[09:44] <sp|urr> munim: yes first i need to be able to boot from the live cd.. i cant do even that!
[09:44] <izmaelis> what option should i use in mplayer.conf file to allways enable surroound 5.1 sound?
[09:44] <jesokit> ?
[09:44] <scott_> sp|urr: why can't you? whats stops you?
[09:44] <dnite> SneeR, really? i've never had as error w/ speaker-test... i dunno what to tell ya then. search google ..
[09:44] <timhaughton> My Ubuntu seems to have a new kernel installed. In addition to the generic kernel, there is a 386 kernel. Do I need the 386 kernel? Or just the generic?
[09:44] <sp|urr> scott_ : kernel panic!
[09:44] <froggontherocks> well the install is a live cd as well so I should be able to tell that way if there will be issues right?
[09:44] <munim> i don't know how to get it to boot from live cd though... try enabling your onboard graphics card.. will work then
[09:44] <withaY> just generic if you have edgy installed.
[09:45] <keeb> froggontherocks, the live cd is wonderful and works either way
[09:45] <timhaughton> !thanks | withaY
[09:45] <ubotu> withaY: You're Welcome!
[09:45] <timhaughton> ?
[09:45] <timhaughton> lol
[09:45] <timhaughton> withaY: Thanks
[09:45] <keeb> but ATI cards for 64bit are in an even worse state than their 32bit counterparts
[09:45] <keeb> for 3d acceleration, anyway
[09:45] <SneeR> dnite you're lucky ))
[09:45] <withaY> :)
[09:45] <kzm_> ifireball, dunno.  I managed to mount the rootfs under /mnt, but I don't quite know how thingss are supposed to proceed.
[09:45] <froggontherocks> Ok thanks when the torrents are done I'll check both out from the live cd's then
[09:45] <sp|urr> munim: i will try that...
[09:45] <kzm_> Anybody know the setup of initrd (in particular the scripts)
[09:46] <froggontherocks> thanks for the help
[09:46] <munim> sure.. it will work then
[09:46] <recon> kzm_: you mean the startup scripts?
[09:46] <withaY> ugh!  i can't install a printer.
[09:46] <sp|urr> scott_: forums suggested i try acpi=off and even pci=off and acpi=force pnpbios=off.. many combination.. no success
[09:46] <huumori> hi anyone can help me a bit?
[09:46] <recon> !ask
[09:46] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:46] <munim> yeah yeah i know!! been there!!
[09:46] <sp|urr> ofcoz i dont want to run pci=off.. i need by USB

[09:47] <kzm_> recon, yes.  on initrd, under /scripts
[09:47] <omV0> hi, i'm using FF2.0 with latest ubuntu.. everytime i go to www.torrentspy.com firefox crashes.. i disabled all addons... still does it.. can somebody please try to go to torrentspy.com and see if it's just me?
[09:47] <ifireball> kzm_: is there a /dev/nfs file when running in the initrd?
[09:47] <huumori> i have started use ubuntu last nigth and i have prob with this xchat i can see channels users like windows what i must to do?
[09:47] <munim> believe me i have suffered with this problem for over a year with all distos.. now i just use it with my onboard card
[09:47] <foreverconnected> I'll check it out omV0
[09:47] <kzm_> ifireball, should there be?
[09:47] <omV0> thanks foreverconnected =)
[09:47] <Harry> hey whats up
[09:47] <keeb> yo
[09:47] <sp|urr> munim: hmmm. i am going to try that now.
[09:47] <jesokit> aiutoooo italia
[09:47] <ifireball> kzm_: I think so, there is no UDEV running that early in the boot process afaik
[09:47] <Harry> to use ubuntu on windows pc do i need the i386 iso?
[09:48] <recon> kzm_: I don't really no what to do. sry.
[09:48] <sp|urr> munim: i'll be back.. eheh
[09:48] <sparrw> huumori: uhm, thats a prob?  thats how mirc and kvirc and every other gui irc client works.
[09:48] <sp|urr> munim: thanks for the tip..
[09:48] <Harry> im running a intel 2.8 ht
[09:48] <munim> k.. :-)
[09:48] <munim> sure
[09:48] <foreverconnected> Harry: um... .Ubuntu is a operating system
[09:48] <Harry> yeah
[09:48] <sparrw> huumori: just maximize the windows if you dont want to be able to see them
[09:48] <Harry> but which iso do i need
[09:48] <jesokit>  aiuto italia
[09:48] <foreverconnected> Harry: It REPLACES windows
[09:48] <Harry> theres several different versions
[09:48] <munim> oh... just select the first ISO harry
[09:48] <Harry> which iso do ii need
[09:48] <sparrw> foreverconnected: yes, but given that he is running windows that is a good indicator that he needs the i386 iso  :)
[09:48] <Harry> my processor is intel 2.8 ghz hyper threading
[09:48] <sparrw> Harry: i386, disc 1.
[09:49] <huumori> but sparrow i want see those names but i cant ;S?
[09:49] <Harry> k ty
[09:49] <sparrw> huumori: what names?
[09:49] <omV0> foreverconnected: did ff2 crash or did it work for you?
[09:49] <foreverconnected> i386 if you previously used windows XP
[09:49] <ifireball> kzm_: you can dissect the initrd image buy gunzipping it and then mounting it with "-o loop"
[09:49] <huumori> name list like who is in channel ;S
[09:49] <Harry> is this the correc tone
[09:49] <Harry> ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso
[09:49] <sparrw> i wish ubuntu packaged more k7-specific stuff
[09:49] <sparrw> harmental: -alternate seems wrong
[09:50] <kzm_> ifireball, right!  I have a working one to compare to (with an old kernel)
[09:50] <sparrw> Harry:  -alternate seems wrong
[09:50] <Harry> how much gb does ubuntu take up to install
[09:50] <Harry> which iso out of this
[09:50] <sparrw> Harry: a default install is about 2GB
[09:50] <Harry> ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca/pub/mirror/ubuntu-releases/6.06/
[09:50] <munim> try keeping 8-10gb
[09:50] <huumori> i have name list in windows and can i get it in this ubuntu too?
[09:50] <sparrw> why are you downloading 6.06?
[09:50] <foreverconnected> Harry: It will erase everything on your hdd, I hope you know this.
[09:51] <sparrw> huumori: there should be a name list on the right side of each channel window
[09:51] <foreverconnected> harry: you can run it alongside windows
[09:51] <Harry> forever im using vmware
[09:51] <sparrw> foreverconnected: will not.  6.10 has a partioner that can resize NTFS
[09:51] <foreverconnected> harry: using a partitioner that will install a bootloader.
[09:51] <munim> oh.. you are on VMWare.. say that!
[09:51] <Harry> my bad lol
[09:51] <foreverconnected> :P
[09:52] <Harry> so i fim suign vmware
[09:52] <Harry> if im using vmware
[09:52] <Harry> whats steps do i neeed
[09:52] <foreverconnected> I was worried you dident know the difference between linux as software and linux as an operating system. :)
[09:52] <sparrw> ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso
[09:52] <huumori> but i can see only who is write something left side but there is nothing on right side :/
[09:52] <sparrw> if you want a "normal" install
[09:52] <sparrw> -alternate- and -server- have different default software
[09:52] <lupine_85> sparrw , foreverconnected: do /not/ trust the ubuntu NTFS resizer if you can help it
[09:53] <sparrw> lupine_85: heh, i trusted it.  booted windows once, just to make sure.  it was ok.  havent run it since  :)
[09:53] <munim> hmm.. i have never resized partitions..
[09:53] <sparrw> since installing kubuntu, ive booted memtest more often than windows
[09:53] <Harry> so.....
[09:53] <foreverconnected> So are any of you intelligent folk aware of the superbug going on with Samba and Edgy Eft?
[09:53] <lupine_85> I've known ntfsresize to break several partitions, now
[09:54] <lupine_85> including one at an install day I was at! :D
[09:54] <sparrw> lupine_85: it helps when the NTFS is fresh  :)
[09:54] <sparrw> Harry: what are you going to DO with ubuntu?
[09:54] <Harry> basic stuff
[09:54] <sparrw> Harry: you can install all the same software from apt no matter which iso you get, but they come with different defaults.  if youre a normal user, then -desktop- is the one you want
[09:54] <munim> like?
[09:55] <sparrw> -desktop- will give you a windows-killer  :)
[09:55] <Harry> okay to install it suing vmware
[09:55] <Harry> what will happen
[09:55] <sparrw> "boot" it in vmware
[09:55] <sparrw> youll be running it as a live cd.  then click the "install" shortcut on the desktop.

[09:56] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[09:56] <sparrw> you can interrupt the boot process and do a command line install if you want, but its easier to just use the gui
[09:56] <huumori> sparrow now i can see name list it was hiding ;$

[09:57] <Thumper322> Who do I ask?

[10:05] <bunnythebunny> Its just its so frustrating i dont know where to start fixing things. I want to get my internet just fine. Its the number one priority above everything.
[10:05] <VigoFuse> C: is the XP, and yes, I would druther it be gone
[10:05] <ifireball> Sierra|zzz: you don't HAVE a local DNS cache unless you're running nscd
[10:05] <Psy-X> Hello
[10:05] <Sierra|zzz> hm
[10:05] <Sierra|zzz> lol
[10:05] <munim> oh.. if thats the case, just boot with the Ubuntu cd....
[10:05] <VigoFuse> I tried the Dual Boot, it didnt take
[10:05] <nuberun> Hi, I want to know the config files for gnome-network-manager because I'm loosing the DNS servers every time
[10:06] <Sierra|zzz> ifireball, I dont think that its an ISP cache, but I could be wrong
[10:06] <ifireball> Sierra|zzz: if you do have tit installed, its a simple matter of "sudu /etc/init.d/nscd restart"
[10:06] <munim> you can do DualBoot if you have unpartitioned freespace
[10:06] <nuberun> and I'm unable to find it
[10:06] <whaq> ifireball, only femalekind has that installed..
[10:06] <ifireball> Sierra|zzz: you can see exactly what you're getting from the ISP with the dig or host commands
[10:06] <munim> :-D whaq
[10:06] <Sierra|zzz> ifireball, I run windows virtually in ubuntu and IE7 picks up DNS changes much faster than Firefox in the host ubuntu
[10:06] <LjL> munim: or if you have partitioned freespace and are willing to take the risk of a partition resize during install
[10:07] <Sierra|zzz> ifireball, how do you use those commands?
[10:07] <Sierra|zzz> host or dig
[10:07] <whaq> munim, i just thought he was rather unfair and discriminatory :>
[10:07] <ifireball> Sierra|zzz: refer to the man pages please

[10:08] <bokey> nuberun# good. go to /etc/dhclient.conf and make some changes. report back when you are ready. you need to be root.
[10:08] <bunnythebunny> I wish i could know why, just why, When i do the whole ipv6 thing, i get this "(gedit:5310): GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:
[10:08] <thunder_storm> i've spoken to a lot of community-users, they have the same problem, too
[10:08] <bunnythebunny> Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed." I want to know why. I am sure i put the right password. Does this mean the changes i made are not accepted? I saved the file, and everytime i open it, its there, but i just want to know if this is supossed to happen or not
[10:09] <VigoFuse> That makes sence.
[10:09] <ifireball> Sierra|zzz: you may be seeing FF's DNS cache rather then a system wide one, did you try using "ping" to see if it gives different results then FF?
[10:09] <nuberun> Ok, I will check but also I want to know where can I setup the ip address
[10:09] <Sierra|zzz> ifireball, yes ofc :)
[10:09] <nuberun> using gnome-network-manager
[10:10] <withaY> i'm trying to add a network printer.  i'm in the lpadmin group and the adm group.  my cups error log is telling me, however, "CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer: Unauthorized".  i haven't touched cups.conf since i installed edgy.  any tips?
[10:10] <Sierra|zzz> ifireball, thanks for showing me host and dig -- i have no further questions
[10:10] <VigoFuse> Will the install give a graphicall or a numericall option of creating a space?
[10:10] <Sierra|zzz> :0
[10:10] <gimmulf> Where is the C header files located?
[10:10] <slimz> hey guys, is there anyway i can setup my ubuntu box so other pcs (win/lin) can stream video off it?
[10:10] <bokey> nuberun# u don't. your router/modem leases you IP address since dhcp is running on your modem.
[10:10] <thunder_storm> can somebody look on the command "top" apt-index-watch use 35-50% CPU-Load every 2-5 seconds.
[10:11] <ifireball> slimz: uncountable ways
[10:11] <munim> Uhh.. there will be an option called Use Existing Free Space which will take the free unparitioned space to make the linux partitions
[10:11] <nuberun> no because I only use dhcp for the wireless connection
[10:11] <VigoFuse> Thats the ticket, thank you
[10:11] <ifireball> slimz: err... I mean innumerable...
[10:11] <slimz> ifireball : preferably something with some sort of on demand options, for someone to pick a video, and skip throug it
[10:11] <munim> VLC is an option
[10:11] <stefg> slimz: have a look at www.videolan.org for the details, and install vlc / vls from the repos ...
[10:11] <mhz> hi all
[10:12] <munim> ..for streaming
[10:12] <bokey> nuberun# your original query was dns dissappears everytime. right ?
[10:12] <blue_guy> which client makes your username n=...  ?
[10:12] <slimz> stefg: ive tried videolan, but you can only stream what youre watching no?
[10:12] <nuberun> yes
[10:12] <ifireball> slimz: yeah VLC can do some streaming but not VOD at the level you want
[10:12] <LjL> slimz: no, it can work from the command line as well
[10:12] <slimz> is there anything that can do it on demand?
[10:13] <mhz> I have set up firestarter in order to use a GUI for ip-tables. However, even after setting it to open port 10000, nmap still doesn't show it open. Any ideas?
[10:13] <bokey> nuberun# good. then do as I say. go to /etc/dhclient.conf and open up the line that says supersede. or if it's not there, possibly inside /etc/dhclient3/dhclient.conf
[10:13] <blue_guy> I notice a lot of people joining this room with usernames like n=user  ... I'm wondering what IRC client(s) do that
[10:13] <ifireball> slimz: afaik VLC site has some howto on setting up apache as a VOD streaming server and using VLC as a client (other Linux clients can do this too)
[10:13] <LjL> slimz: http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-howto/en/ch11.html
[10:13] <LjL> slimz: or just google "vlc vod"
[10:13] <stefg> slimz: vls is the server component, vlc is the player... vlc is the swiss army chainsaw of mediaplayers, see the command line options of vlc, not only what the GUI offers :-)
[10:14] <nuberun> this line it's marked as a comment
[10:14] <mhz> blue_guy: I do not know. I am using GAIM now, instead of Xchat (prefer the latter)
[10:14] <munim> VLC RoCkS!
[10:14] <ifireball> stefg: VLS is abandonware
[10:14] <blue_guy> mhz, yeah, that's what I'm using (XChat)
[10:14] <mumbles>  herm ... how do i use a makefile.PL ? Python ?
[10:14] <slimz> abandonware?
[10:14] <someperson> i am having some install problems
[10:14] <ifireball> mumbles: PL == Perl
[10:15] <munim> who abandoned VLC?
[10:15] <slimz> ifireball: you think it would be easier to do in windows?
[10:15] <LjL> he said VLS not VLC
[10:15] <bokey> nuberun# good. open it up.
[10:15] <ifireball> slimz: meaning its been undeveloped and unmaintained for years
[10:15] <stefg> ifireball: that's mostly correct, but doesn't matter if you just need a working streaming server
[10:15] <someperson> it just sits at configuring apt
[10:15] <munim> oh.. i assumed it was a typo
[10:15] <ifireball> slimz: no way
[10:15] <bokey> nuberun# basically it supersedes what your router/modem gives u as a valid DNS entries.
[10:16] <VigoFuse> Thank you kindly.
[10:16] <nuberun> ok, thx for your assistance
[10:16] <bokey> nuberun# uncomment it and then type superseded <your_primary_dns_server_address> <your_secondary_dns_server_address>

[10:17] <ifireball> slimz: as far as I can remember its just a matter of setting up a recnt apache (the apache2 version that ships with ubuntu is recent enough) to share the files, and then just connecting to it and requesting the files with http:// URLS with VLC/mplayer

[10:21] <foreverconnected> unfortunatley, I'm telling you that it will probably completely break samba
[10:21] <stefg> harry1: i still don't understand... you have a vmx-file with an ubuntu virtual machine and want vmplayer to open it?
[10:21] <psusi> Ademan: I think you mean /dev/cdrom not /media
[10:21] <mhz> ifireball: therefore I believe it is still closed
[10:21] <ifireball> mhz: and what does it say about "all other ports"?
[10:21] <foreverconnected> SAMBA in Edgy Eft is completely broken
[10:21] <foreverconnected> and nobody here seems to know what's wrong
[10:21] <psusi> mhz: you are running nmap on the local host?
[10:21] <someperson> oh! just got an error "Cannot access security updates"
[10:21] <Ademan> psusi: no i mean /media/cdrom0
[10:21] <Wnutt> linnuxxy: it's a good idea to activate the user too: smbpasswd -a <yourusername>

[10:25] <munim> okay.. i got to go... byeeee
[10:25] <foreverconnected> Well, here's the issue I'm having. Samba will not install properly anymore, and originally, when I enabled filesharing I could send files to windows shares on windows boxes.
[10:25] <foreverconnected> this still works, now, however
[10:25] <Wnutt> sure ! amazing support here !
[10:25] <nuberun> It leases an IP address, but again is changing the DNS server for another one that I used
[10:25] <harry1> how do I install ubuntu with vmware? how do i make a vmx file without workstation
[10:25] <harry1> hello
[10:25] <ifireball> harry1: you can't. stop bugging. its how VMware are supposed to make a profit
[10:25] <nuberun> when I was in another place
[10:25] <alecjw> if i plug a new sound card in, what command do i have to do to autodetect it?
[10:26] <foreverconnected> I can now right click a folder and share it. when I select SMB share, it goes right back to unix share
[10:26] <nuberun> so I think that it's using another profile
[10:26] <foreverconnected> and refuses to work
[10:26] <foreverconnected> uninstalling Samba works.
[10:26] <tylerl> I used synaptic to install Java for me.  I intended on having it be installed in a dir like /usr/local/java5.0/... but it just put all of the java files in /usr/bin/.. Is that normal?

[10:31] <bokey> ifireball# i am taking different route here. using cifs instead of smb.

[10:33] <foreverconnected> Now, remember, I can read windos shares
[10:33] <foreverconnected> bokey: I can read and PUSH to windows shares.
[10:33] <stefg> tylerl: synaptic uses a package, this means there are predefined locations for the files, in the case of Java it's something like /usr/lib/java. the whoe idea of package management is to rid you of the worry, where your files go....
[10:33] <foreverconnected> and pull from
[10:33] <foreverconnected> bokey: but I can't setup this machine with a share
[10:34] <foreverconnected> bokey: and installing samba fails
[10:34] <tylerl> stefg: k.  Just wondering.
[10:34] <bokey> foreverconnected# ok then, mount -ro -t cifs //your_windows_ip/shared_folder -o username=<your_username>,password=<your_password> /media/<whatever>
[10:34] <ifireball> foreverconnected: like I just tole bokey those 2 functionalityes are almost completly unrelated
[10:34] <bokey> foreverconnected# ditch samba. it sucks anywayz
[10:34] <gh0st_> test
[10:35] <ifireball> foreverconnected: did you try purging and reinstalling like I asked you to?
[10:36] <thewayner> If I do a man (anything) from a ssh session I get garbage at the end of some of the lines, this does not happen if I am connected to the console.  I have even tried a fresh edgy install
[10:37] <gimmulf> Where do i find my C Header files that match my running kernel??
[10:37] <stefg> thewayner: cough,cough... would be more interesting on a fresh /Dapper/ -install ...
[10:37] <bokey> foreverconnected# /usr/src/kernel-*your_kernel_version*/
[10:38] <ifireball> thewayner: that probably has to do wuth differences in charset between the server and client, check your locale settings
[10:38] <bokey> oops.
[10:38] <bokey> thewayner# =)
[10:38] <Ayabara> anyone got an answer for me? (pretty please)
[10:38] <jerp> hmm, booting a file that calls for sudo is something Id like to know too
[10:38] <ifireball> gimmulf: you just use the *-headers" package that matches your installed kernel package
[10:38] <gimmulf> bokey: it says my kernel version is: version 2.6.15-27-386   but in /usr/src/ the only dirs is:  linux-headers-2.6.15-23-386/  and  linux-headers-2.6.15-23/

[10:40] <boodzut> wellhello: im using linux for my server, and i have a linksys, and where at in ubuntu would i go to, to assign my server a static lan ip for example like 192.168.1.105, i know how to do it on windows but not linux ;/
[10:40] <ifireball> boodzut: are you usign GUI or the command line?
[10:40] <stefg> gimmulf: installing vmplayer/vmserver?

[10:40] <boodzut> ifireball i could do both ways? linux server on other room
[10:41] <gimmulf> stefg:  yes :)
[10:41] <boodzut> i usually use SSH to it
[10:41] <jerp> correction: loading a file when booting that demands sudo
[10:41] <ifireball> TooTallJones: you're supposed to install your own themes in your home folder not system-wide
[10:41] <stefg> gimmulf: you need the complete source tree installed
[10:41] <gimmulf> stefg:  mm im installing the headers now
[10:41] <rotH> Hello guys :D
[10:41] <someperson> for some reason, i cant get any packages from anywhere, nor can i get the package lists

[10:42] <rotH> i just downloaded ubuntuu, this is soo neat and nice!
[10:42] <ademan_> is the ubuntu team aware of the troubles involved with using the newest binary nvidia drivers? (crap having to do with the legacy drivers and a kernel module mismatch)

[10:42] <rotH> Im new at Linux, can someone help me configure and actualize Ubuntu ?.. i cant hear music, view videos.. etc..
[10:43] <ifireball> boodzut: oh, is that some web-based GUI?
[10:43] <stefg> gimmulf: you need to sudo apt-get install linux-source, and unpack the .bz2 file in /usr/src and put a symlink /usr/src/linux to the unpacked directory in place

However, "sudo apt-get install ssh-krb5 krb5-user krb4-config" tells me that "openssh-client openssh-server ubuntu-base ubuntu-standard" are all going to be removed.  I'm not surprised that openssh-* will be removed if I'm installing kerberose versions of ssh, but is it okay for those ubuntu packages to be removed?
[10:46] <bruenig> someperson, try sudo killall apt-get

[10:54] <mseney> how does 6.06 LTS differ from 6.10 in terms of updates? will 6.10 be end of lifed sooner than 6.06?
[10:54] <jerp> I dont know what is wrong
[10:54] <ifireball> foreverconnected: try gnome-user-share
[10:54] <Gdon> y a un francais ici ?

[10:55] <bokey> ifireball# he can't even ping his window share. let alone mounting.
[10:55] <sp|urr> where is munim?
[10:55] <kirkland> is it possible to kick off an ubuntu 6.10 installation from a usb key?  eg, on a machine without a cdrom?
[10:55] <bruenig> jerp, what is it that you are trying to accomplish through your use of easybuntu
[10:55] <stefg> mseney: 6.06 has the LTS tag, that means 3 years support. 6.10 edgy will be phased out after 18 months, i think
[10:56] <slimz> anyone know how i can open port :5900 for vnc?
[10:56] <foreverconnected> bokey: I can ping my windows share
[10:56] <bokey> ifireball# it's in his best interest to sort out his windows thing.
[10:56] <sp|urr> munim: you were right. the AGP card was causing the live CD boot problems. by switching back to onboard i was able to install and now it is time to fix the nvidia issue
[10:56] <mseney> bruenig, server is where i really care the most
[10:56] <ifireball> bokey: again, you're looking at this in the wrong direction, he wants to see the Linux from window not th other way around; besides that problem can be solved easily enough with winbind
[10:56] <cfedde> "phased out" is probably not the best way to say that.
[10:56] <bruenig> mseney, the server for 6.06 is five year suppor
[10:56] <jerp> bruenig, isnt it a way to accomplish a funtional edgy
[10:56] <bruenig> mseney, the 6.10 I am not sure but it is obviously much lower
[10:56] <Eons> anybody knows how to set "swappiness"?
[10:56] <mseney> bruenig, i'll download that then. thanks!!!
[10:57] <ubuntupaul> is there a ubuntu channel for newbees?
[10:57] <Wodger> i thought you had opened vnc on a compter at home?
[10:57] <bruenig> jerp, yes but what do you want? codecs?
[10:57] <bokey> ifireball# geez.. wtf am I wasting my time for!
[10:57] <Nanaki_Yamabushi> How can I change the boot theme and the login them under ubuntu? which program must I use to change it?
[10:57] <bruenig> ubuntulog, what sort of help do you need?
[10:57] <clearzen> I'm getting a error while trying to install a package called libanyevent-perl. Can anyone help me install it?
[10:57] <foreverconnected> I can see and access and put and pull files from windows shares. the issue is that I cannot setup a share in ubuntu that I can use from windows, because samba is broken
[10:57] <stefg> ubuntupaul: you're right in it :-)
[10:57] <jerp> I think thats' what the how to stated at the start
[10:57] <foreverconnected> and this issue is noted on launchpad.
[10:58] <ubuntupaul> I understand some of what is being said, but the network stuff is flying right over my head
[10:58] <bruenig> clearzen, what does that package do? I am not finding it in my repos
[10:58] <bokey> foreverconnected# roger that.
[10:59] <ifireball> foreverconnected: samba is the only SMB server for Linux, however, if you don't mind using another file sharing protocol, you have a few options
[10:59] <clearzen> it says this to me:  trying to overwrite `/usr/share/man/man3/AnyEvent.3pm.gz', which is also in package anyevent-perl
[10:59] <clearzen> I can put a copy of my sources.list in pastebin
[10:59] <foreverconnected> basically, I want my smb server back :(
[10:59] <foreverconnected> having samba broken will probably bork a lot of stuff.
[10:59] <kirkland> slimz: you'll need something like "-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5900 -j ACCEPT" in your iptables config
[10:59] <bruenig> clearzen, nevermind I found it, it is anyevent-perl not libanyevent-perl
[10:59] <someperson> i let it sit, and it returned this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31758/
[10:59] <clearzen> sorry
[11:00] <kirkland> slimz: if you have ssh open, copy the line with port 22 open, and replace 22 with 5900
[11:00] <Nanaki_Yamabushi> How do I change the login screen theme under ubuntu
[11:00] <hp_> #se
[11:00] <clearzen> bruenig: It says I can't install libevent-execflow-perl without anyevent-perl but it won't let me install it
[11:00] <hp_> #se
[11:00] <pfhomer> Why isn't seamonkey in my Dapper repositories?
[11:00] <bruenig> Nanaki_Yamabushi, system>administrations>login window you can add themes in that, you can get other themes from art.gnome.org or gnome-look.org
[11:01] <ifireball> foreverconnected: not really, you can't use samba for much more then being an SMB server no not that many things depend on it
[11:01] <gattic> Is there any way to change the window manager in ubuntu?
[11:01] <jerp> hahahha, Ive given up on anything xgl/aiglx/beryl, as many how to[ out there makes it crazy for me to install

[11:02] <foreverconnected> it's nifty, but the support drivers for ATI/AMD video cards are the sux.

[11:12] <philipsmith> bruenig: Thanks!
[11:12] <Mas> ok let me see
[11:12] <Polysics> i feel stupid
[11:12] <cello_rasp> if it works then the cd is ok
[11:12] <Polysics> where do i go to change the basic colors in gnome?
[11:13] <bruenig> Polysics, if you want to change the theme, that is in system>preferences>themes
[11:13] <sgirc> I need it because I have graphic problems when installing ubuntu
[11:13] <Polysics> that works, but i can't set colors for the taskbar and stuff
[11:13] <Polysics> i would like white fonts on black background
[11:13] <Mas> it says launching browser, please wait
[11:13] <bruenig> Polysics, you need to get themes that have those colors, try art.gnome.org or gnome-look.org for some good themes
[11:13] <Polysics> boy, kde dumbed me down :-)
[11:14] <sgirc> or at least a relevant link where I could find this info
[11:14] <Polysics> bruenig, oh, i see, thanks :-)
[11:14] <cello_rasp> Mas: it works then i guess
[11:14] <harm> I installed eggdrop via apt-get but i cant find the config file, and its not mentioned in the man page anyone know where it is?
[11:14] <me__> i'm running kubuntu, how do i get the correct drivers for my video card so it runs better?
[11:14] <Polysics> so it's not possible to simply select the colors?
[11:14] <bruenig> !ati
[11:14] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:14] <SpAc> is it worth even running the 64 bit version yet given that some packages are lacking?
[11:14] <bruenig> SpAc, I think not. I don't even though I have a 64 bit processor, just too much hassle
[11:14] <ixian_> any advice on making my fonts look really good in ubuntu edgy (on a 17" CRT monitor)? ive tried different settings and fonts but they never seem to look as good as the fonts in windows xp. they seem to be kinda jagged or aliased.... any suggestions?
[11:15] <sgirc> ubotu: are you answering me ?
[11:15] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about are you answering me ? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:15] <foreverconnected> brb
[11:15] <bruenig> !info msttcorefonts
[11:15] <ubotu> msttcorefonts: Installer for Microsoft TrueType core fonts. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.2ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 22 kB, installed size 164 kB
[11:15] <bruenig> !bot
[11:15] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[11:15] <SpAc> bruenig: can't run a straight wine build either can I? Have to run a chroot or something
[11:15] <sgirc> ah ok
[11:15] <Mas> yeah but when i boot from the cd showing some error blocking 25545566 something like that
[11:15] <sgirc> feeling stupid
[11:15] <bruenig> SpAc, not sure on that but  neverthelss still a beating regardless
[11:15] <ixian_> bruenig, i have tried msttcorefonts... any particular font i should use?
[11:16] <SpAc> hmm.... shame!
[11:16] <Polysics> btw, weird thing i just noticed, my logout window doesn't have shutdown and restart any more
[11:16] <cello_rasp> Mas: right. there is an option to test the CD integrity on the menu
[11:16] <sgirc> :(
[11:16] <Polysics> only hibernate and logout
[11:16] <bruenig> ixian_, don't know but you want some MS fonts, that should do it
[11:16] <sgirc> the first i use irc
[11:16] <SpAc> bruenig: been waiting a while to fully harness the 64 bit power!.... still waiting
[11:16] <sgirc> first time
[11:17] <lupine_85> a little off-topic, but can anyone point me to a program in ubuntu's repos that will point out slowdowns in a program? :)
[11:17] <lupine_85> (for code optimisation purposes_
[11:17] <Akuma_> where can i find the env vars config files?
[11:17] <Mas> so u think it may fix the problem?
[11:17] <harm> I installed eggdrop via apt-get but i cant find the config file, and its not mentioned in the man page anyone know where it is?
[11:17] <ixian_> bruenig, i am using tahoma currently but it doesnt look as 'good' as in windows.. .like i said... its slightly jagged or whatever. i guess i need advice on what settings to use for the 'hinting' or something
[11:17] <bruenig> SpAc, there will be dual arch at some point soon, hopefully feisty
[11:17] <lupine_85> Dual arch works now
[11:17] <bruenig> ixian_, oh not sure, my xubuntu fonts look pretty good so I never messed with them
[11:17] <cello_rasp> no. it will only tell you that something is wrong. I guess the sectors that ubuntu is on are corrupted. Try burning the CD again, if the same thing happens either there is something wrong with your drive (burning or reading) or there is a bad sector on the IMAGE you burned from.
[11:17] <lupine_85> you just manually install the amd64 kernel :)
[11:18] <cello_rasp> @ mas
[11:18] <SpAc> what do you mean?
[11:18] <cello_rasp> SpAc he means install via command line, apt-get or aptitude
[11:19] <ZacharyG> hello
[11:19] <Mas> you want me try again?
[11:19] <bruenig> !hi | ZacharyG
[11:19] <ubotu> ZacharyG: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[11:19] <worldjam> how do I make my user have root permissions?
[11:19] <botxj> !hi | botxj
[11:19] <ubotu> botxj: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[11:19] <cello_rasp> Mas: it seems there is a bad sector on the CD what else can you do..
[11:19] <sgirc> Does anybody know what is the vga code for a 1280x800 resolution with 32 bits color ?
[11:19] <bruenig> worldjam, precede a command with sudo
[11:19] <bruenig> !root | worldjam
[11:19] <ubotu> worldjam: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:20] <SpAc> I just did a fresh install from the 64 Edgy cd. When I run uname -r it doesn't make reference to the 64 bit kernel at all... just generic... is that a problem?! Not sure what I'm asking really. This is my first time with the linux desktop
[11:20] <cello_rasp> Mas: you could burn it again?
[11:20] <worldjam> yeh I know that but is there a way so its not just in the terminal?
[11:21] <bruenig> worldjam, if you want to move files graphically with the file manager, open a terminal and do gksudo nautilus that will give you a root file manager
[11:21] <Mas> ok , yeah i can  , is there any posibility to download and install directly?
[11:21] <worldjam> ok cheers
[11:21] <wh0> anyone knows how to get an mp3 codec "plugin" for k3b?
[11:21] <cello_rasp> Mas: there is, but it involves using floppy drives and a bit of hacking
[11:21] <wh0> i cant burn cds from mp3 filea
[11:22] <rogue780> I know this is a little off topic, sorry. anyone here know PHP?
[11:22] <Polysics> anyway, Beryl is really made of win
[11:22] <cello_rasp> #php do
[11:22] <Polysics> rogue780, quite well, but wrong channel :-)
[11:22] <crimsun> wh0: edgy?
[11:22] <cello_rasp> or #php-users :P
[11:22] <sgirc> Does anybody know what is the vga code for a 1280x800 resolution with 32 bits color ?
[11:22] <Polysics> the ppl in #php are nice
[11:22] <sgirc> Does anybody know what is the vga code for a 1280x800 resolution with 32 bits color ?
[11:22] <bruenig> !repeat
[11:22] <ubotu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly, if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[11:22] <lupine_85> SpAc: uname -a will tell you what architecture the "generic" kernel is compiled for
[11:22] <Polysics> i don't even know what a vga code is :-)
[11:22] <rogue780> Polysics, thanks.
[11:22] <crimsun> wh0: libk3b2-mp3
[11:22] <SpAc> lupine_85: ok... you're a AMD64 user?
[11:22] <lupine_85> sort of
[11:23] <lupine_85> 64bit kernel, 32bit userspace
[11:23] <wh0> chrees
[11:23] <lupine_85> several 64bit chroots :)
[11:23] <bruenig> chrees...
[11:23] <wh0> rsrs
[11:23] <me__> i got the nvidia driver from package manager, and tried to run sudo nvidia-config-enable, but it gives me this when I run it: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[11:23] <me__> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[11:23] <wh0> cheers
[11:23] <wh0> :)
[11:23] <Mas> well can u explain if didnt work this way I can try that
[11:24] <Gorlith> when i try to  : sudo echo blacklist bcm43xx >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist      i get permission denied back any idead?
[11:24] <SpAc> me__: what system are you running?
[11:24] <Gorlith> ubuntu edgy
[11:24] <sgirc> sorry guys
[11:24] <lupine_85> Gorlith: yep, sudo doesn't like the > operator
[11:24] <bruenig> Gorlith, that happens to me and I wondered how to fix it also, could never figure it out. I think the problem arises because the sudo is only going to the echo command and not the command to append
[11:24] <me__> SpAc, you mean kubuntu? i built my pc
[11:24] <sgirc> Im speaking about boot options
[11:24] <bruenig> Gorlith, you can do sudo -s, then run it
[11:25] <SpAc> me__: have you looked at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[11:25] <crimsun> Gorlith: use echo and |sudo tee -a
[11:25] <me__> SpAc, yes i'm there right now
[11:25] <SpAc> me__: 64 or 32 bit install?
[11:25] <sgirc> one can fix the screen definition (i have a laptop) with the vga option (i.e. vga=771)
[11:25] <stylus> how can I fix my look ups? they are really slowing down web browsing and stuff.
[11:26] <me__> SpAc, Oh i'm not sure, the basic one from kubuntu's site
[11:26] <SpAc> me__: ok
[11:26] <SpAc> me__: open your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for editing with gksudogedit/etc/X11/xorg.conf and be sure that the Driver entry under Section"Device" is  set to "nvidia"
[11:26] <sgirc> but I can't find ont the the code (like 771) corresponding to a resolution of 1280x800
[11:27] <SpAc> me__: if you are sure you've installed the drivers correctly, restart X with CTRL + ALT + Backspace. If it doesn't work you'll be stuck at the command prompt.
[11:27] <sgirc> If I run with default setting I get a black screen as soon as the graphical server is launched in the installation process
[11:27] <omV0> i am using ubuntu edgy and alsa doesn't work (no device found) even though oss works fine... i am using SiS AC'97.. i tried all the forums, couldn't get it to work =(
[11:27] <we2by> is there a paint program similar to ms paint?
[11:27] <SpAc> me__: otherwise, you'll be laughing. Did the exact same process myself last night
[11:27] <sgirc> and I'm using ubuntu 6.10
[11:28] <iratik> Whats the command to reset the system clock to the correct time from the console? (I'm looking at the edgy docs, and oddly enough a grep for "ntp." or "sync time" or "set time" turns up nothing)????!
[11:28] <iratik> date
[11:28] <iratik> woops, sorry - didn't mean to type 'date'
[11:28] <SpAc> me__: are you familiar with a command line editor such as vim or nano?
[11:28] <Polysics> last stupid question for the evening
[11:28] <me__> SpAc, no not at all, what is gksudo gedit?
[11:28] <Polysics> why did my shutdown and restart buttons disappear? :-)
[11:28] <socomm> iratik: Why not just apt-get the programs?
[11:29] <iratik> socomm: whats programs - i just need a single command to reset the time to the correct time
[11:29] <iratik> socomm: I know there is a single command, i just don't remember what it is
[11:29] <SpAc> me__: know how to open up a terminal?
[11:30] <Polysics> that is, i created a new GDM entry, and when i am logged in with that, the "shudown" window in gnome doesn't have shutdown and restart
[11:30] <Polysics> not a big deal, but it would be comfortable to have em back
[11:30] <RogerBacon> !time
[11:30] <iratik> thanks
[11:30] <RogerBacon> !TIME
[11:30] <RogerBacon> !time
[11:30] <RogerBacon> lol, :D
[11:30] <socomm> iratik: apt-get install ntpdate
[11:30] <iratik> wow, i figured there would be some kind of quick help like that
[11:30] <zerosmoke> so...
[11:31] <zerosmoke> anyone else have a problem with macromedia plugin and mozilla on ubuntu?
[11:31] <iratik> okay, why didn't u just say "ntpdate", i was just looking for the command, i can read the manual now
[11:31] <zerosmoke> it like keeps telling me i don't have the freakin plugin
[11:31] <clearzen> can you rsync from ubuntu to windows?
[11:31] <socomm> zerosmoke: You'll need to install it, if you haven't yet.
[11:31] <zerosmoke> i have
[11:32] <me__> SpAc, yes
[11:32] <socomm> zerosmoke: Where to?
[11:32] <zerosmoke> like i go to www.lionsgate.com and it keeps telling me to install the plugin
[11:32] <SpAc> me__: open a terminal session
[11:32] <socomm> zerosmoke: Should've been /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[11:32] <zerosmoke> ok let me check
[11:32] <me__> SpAc, done
[11:33] <socomm> zerosmoke: While you're at it why not install flash 9 beta?
[11:33] <socomm> zerosmoke: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/
[11:33] <SpAc> me__: now you want to edit a file. Type: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:33] <Polysics> is it difficult to set up graphical grub?
[11:33] <me__> SpAc, ok i'm in
[11:34] <zerosmoke> only plugin seen is libunixprint...
[11:34] <jerp> Ubuntu[ artwork is the top story at www.Linux.com
[11:34] <socomm> Polysics: No, you should be able to find a howto on the web.
[11:34] <SpAc> me__: check and see what the Driver entry under section "Device" is set to
[11:34] <Polysics> as you can see from my questions, i like wasting CPU cycles :-P
[11:35] <heanol> hi, is there supposed to be a splash with grub by default?
[11:35] <pjay_> if i wanted to forward a port on my ssh in terminal how would i do that? ssh host.com ...
=== alecjw is now known as Ubugtu
[11:35] <bimberi> clearzen: i'm sure you can but don't know any details.  I've used 'unison' (similar to rsync) to sync windows and linux.
[11:35] <socomm> heanol: No.
[11:35] <me__> SpAc, i don't see 'device' anywhere
[11:35] <SpAc> me__: have scrolled down using the down arrow?
[11:35] <Polysics> heanol, i'm looking in the same thing
=== Ubugtu is now known as alecjw
[11:36] <Polysics> actually, seems like apt-get install usplash does it
[11:36] <heanol> socomm, ok.. how do i enable it? it says splash on the kernel line in the menu.lst
[11:36] <me__> SpAc, it looks like the file is blank
[11:36] <heanol> ok
[11:36] <SpAc> me__: must be a typo
[11:36] <heanol> usplash is already installed..
[11:36] <psionic> Hello good day!!
[11:36] <zerosmoke> socomm:  where do i find the plugin for firefox flash?
[11:36] <me__> let me try again
[11:36] <socomm> zerosmoke: Huh?
[11:37] <rc-1> clicking on the radio buttons in the open with thing in nautilus doesnt work ideas?
[11:37] <psionic> wao
[11:37] <psionic> ideas?
[11:37] <psionic> hummmm
[11:37] <zerosmoke> socomm, i keep getting the message I need to install the flash for firefox, where is the plugin for that?
[11:37] <psionic> you can use the automatix...
[11:37] <socomm> zerosmoke: Use the installer that comes bundled with flash, and just point it to the right directory.
[11:37] <Polysics> usplash doesn't do it? argh :-)
[11:37] <zerosmoke> hmmm...retry
[11:37] <me__> SpAc, it says NVIDIA FX 5600
[11:38] <sladen> zerosmoke: 'flashplugin-nonfree'
[11:38] <me__> SpAc, it says driver 'nv'
[11:38] <socomm> Polysics: http://www.shockfamily.net/cedric/ubuntu-tips.html
[11:38] <socomm> Polysics: Look for the grub section.
[11:38] <zerosmoke> sladen...what's that?
[11:39] <darkyoshi372> hello everyone! how well will stuff work on a MacBook, especially graphics, and also, is it possible to do it with just boot camp?
[11:40] <neighborlee> anyone here have 64 bit os plugins ( or 32 bit swiftfox with 32 plugins ) working toplay : http://www.gamespot.com < click on video for guitar hero II please...I can't get it to play in either 32 switffox OR 64bit firefox and wonder what im missing here.....
[11:40] <me__> SpAc, maybe my kernel is not matched up with the drivers?
[11:40] <dromer> can anybody help me with this error? checking for Qt... configure: error: Qt (>= Qt 2.2.2) (headers and libraries) not found
[11:40] <neighborlee> anyone know how to use th is new bug reporting tool ?? ( it says to attach this  blah.crash but  does not say HOW to do it ;00 )
[11:40] <psionic> very well men
[11:40] <psionic> i gonna to eat my lunch
[11:41] <foreverconnected> neighborlee: Are you saying basically you don't  have codecs or flash installed on your system?
[11:41] <sladen> zerosmoke: 'flashplugin-nonfree' is the package that you need to install "flash for firefox"
[11:41] <psionic> bye bye
[11:41] <zerosmoke> found the so file
[11:41] <zerosmoke> not where it's supposed to be
[11:41] <neighborlee> foreverconnected, Ihave flash for 32swiftfox and codecs both..all via automatix2
[11:41] <user-land> Does anybody know who is behind Ubuntu multimedia edition 'Linux Mint' featured on distrowatch today ?
[11:41] <SpAc> me__: you can try changing nv to nvidia
[11:41] <geokok> I need a way to change the date in my pics metadata cause they all appear in fspot to ne taken at 2044
[11:42] <me__> SpAc, how do i make sure i'm running the correct kernel for the driver?
[11:42] <neighborlee> foreverconnected, well and the mplayerplugin thing too...from the 'how to install 32bit stuff in 64bit'
[11:42] <neighborlee> foreverconnected, from forum
[11:42] <sladen> neighborlee: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+filebug    file what you did, submit, click "attach" and attach the file from  /var/crash/...
[11:42] <Polysics> ok, splash screen sorted
[11:42] <Polysics> i still don't have shutdown and restart buttons tho :-)
[11:43] <neighborlee> sladen, ic ok thx..
[11:43] <zerosmoke> quick question, what's the command to copy one file from one location to another?
[11:43] <EchoBinary> hey whats the best way to connect to a wireless network using WPA-PSK auth with TKIP encryption
[11:43] <zerosmoke> sudo....
[11:43] <sladen> neighborlee: but I think you should file a bug report against 'apport' saying that it should describe exactly what to do
[11:43] <sladen> zerosmoke: 'cp'
[11:43] <neighborlee> sladen, what then is the 'complete report' < button for on the crash report ?
[11:43] <zerosmoke> thanks
[11:43] <neighborlee> sladen, there is complete and reduced
[11:44] <neighborlee> sladen, what I mean is there is no 'ok' or anything on the gui
[11:44] <geokok> anyone knows how to change the metadata date in my pics?
[11:44] <neighborlee> sladen, oh wait sorry ic now..whe n you click either it does create anew one..I didn't notice it is all..its not obvious really
[11:44] <EchoBinary> anyone know the best way to connect to a wireless network using WPA-PSK auth with TKIP encryption
[11:45] <sladen> neighborlee: the "complete report" includes the whole binary of the program, so that a developer can take your crashed program, rerive the application and debug the problem.  A normal/smaller crash file only includes information about the version and a guess at the backtrace (what the program was probably doing at the point of crash)
[11:45] <sladen> geokok: the metadate is probably inserted by your digital camera, search for programs that can modify "EXIF" metadata
[11:45] <SpAc> me__: are you running a legacy card? Did you try the nv to nvidia change i suggested?
[11:46] <geokok> sladen: I know. it was my fault i forgot to set the date but i cant find any exif editing app
[11:46] <me__> SpAc, no it's not a legacy card, i'll try that fix
[11:48] <radioaktivstorm> I have two problems: (1) I once had a swap partition on my HDD, but when i upgraded Ubuntu, It didnt carry over, I now have a partition with 'unknown' formatting that is several hundred megabytes large. How do I access, reformat and use this partition. (2) Somehow, my skype package is messed up and 'needs to be reinstalled' but i cant install using the package installer, and i cannot use synaptic package manager, and i cant make u
[11:48] <radioaktivstorm> pdates. I also cannot use add/remove programs. Any suggestions?
[11:48] <sladen> geokok: searching the package list for exif with  "apt-cache search exif" has turned up 45 results, are any of those any use---you can do the same search from Synaptic or Adept on the desktop
[11:48] <roll> how to find from shell
[11:49] <roll> looking for httpd.conf file
[11:49] <roll> looking for apache file configuration
[11:49] <radioaktivstorm> so basically i have no swap when i start my computer. and i cant update
[11:49] <liri> seems like libpcap on the repos is outdated (0.8 is available but 0.9.5 is already out...)
[11:49] <] GoldenDragon> Hi, I have a question... a friend of mine is having trouble connecting to several email accounts... one is a school email account where she can connect using one URL but not using another, and she also cannot access any of her accounts on Gmail or Yahoo... I have had no trouble getting onto either.. any ideas what could be wrong?
[11:50] <sladen> radioaktivstorm: (1) use a tool such as the Disks admin, or fdisk on the command line to set the type of the partition (82 Linux Swap) then format the parttion, either with the GUI or the commandline ('mkswap /dev/XYZ'), then add the swap partition to /etc/fstab so that it will be used
[11:50] <crimsun> liri: that's hardly outdated.
[11:50] <TGPO> radioaktivstorm, problem 2 can be done via command line
[11:50] <Polysics> oh well, time to go and actually do something useful
[11:50] <liri> crimsun: right, i was just about to state that i'd like to install libpcap0.9 from source then but I don't want things to be messed up by having 2 versions...
[11:50] <Polysics> thanks all, laters!
[11:50] <TGPO> radioaktivstorm, problem one can be solved with qparted
[11:50] <sladen> radioaktivstorm: your message was cut off.  (2) sudo apt-get install --reinstall skype  if you installed it with a .deb through the installer
[11:50] <geokok> sladen: I ll have to read the descriptions..be back in a while
[11:51] <me__> I just did what you said and it's working perfectly now, thank you
[11:51] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: Using POP or the web?
[11:52] <radioaktivstorm> sladen, terminal returns: The package skype needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it
[11:52] <] GoldenDragon> ummm... I think so.
[11:52] <Stormx2> !skype | radioaktivstorm
[11:52] <crimsun> liri: there's no soname bump for 0.9.5
[11:52] <crimsun> liri: if you choose to recompile it, I'd do it the Debian way.
[11:52] <] GoldenDragon> she's been using Netscape to access it though.
[11:52] <TGPO> Stormx2, ubotu is dead
[11:52] <Stormx2> ;__; what happened?
[11:52] <] GoldenDragon> not Thunderbird, or any other email client.
[11:52] <zerosmoke> dang it, it didn't work
[11:52] <Stormx2> radioaktivstorm: wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeHowto
[11:53] <heanol> going further in my usplash research..
[11:53] <liri> crimsun: im looking at /usr/lib/libpcap.so and its pointing to libpcap0.8 which in turn is pointing to libpcap0.9.4 kind of odd... is libpcap0.8 == libpcap0.9.4 then?
[11:53] <TGPO> Stormx2, nick collision is whats being reported
[11:53] <Stormx2> Ah.
[11:53] <heanol> i get "usplash: no suitable theme found for 640x480" when i boot, and no usplash
[11:53] <zerosmoke> copied so file over to mozilla plugins, no luck
[11:53] <heanol> i'm using vga=791
[11:53] <Stormx2> Hi ubotu :D
[11:53] <heanol> and it's definetly not 640x480
[11:53] <Stormx2> !botsnack
[11:53] <heanol> anyone have any idea why it does that?
[11:53] <crimsun> liri: libpcap0.8 is the name of the package.
[11:53] <] -[erbie> hi everybody
[11:53] <socomm> zerosmoke: /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[11:53] <zerosmoke> yeah
[11:53] <] GoldenDragon> Stormx2, any idea?
[11:53] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon; Hmm, why?
[11:53] <zerosmoke> restarting mozilla
[11:53] <] -[erbie> I have just installed Ubuntu 6.10
[11:53] <] GoldenDragon> why?
[11:53] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: The netscape mail client and stuff?
[11:54] <liri> crimsun: right. so i do have 0.9.4 installed
[11:54] <socomm> zerosmoke: Yeah, restart firefox.
[11:54] <] -[erbie> Totem won't play DVDs... is it normal?
[11:54] <crimsun> liri: and yes, because there's no soname bump, the symlink is proper
[11:54] <] GoldenDragon> no, just uses Netscape to access her gmail and yahoo accounts.
[11:54] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: Seems odd to use netscape on ubuntu is all.
[11:54] <] GoldenDragon> : P
[11:54] <TGPO> ] -[erbie, yes, you need to add in libdvdcss
[11:54] <zerosmoke> holy crap it works
[11:54] <] -[erbie> TGPO: thnx
[11:54] <ubotu> Yum!
[11:54] <] GoldenDragon> i'm sure its nothing ubuntu related..
[11:54] <] GoldenDragon> prbbly more netscape.. but I dunno if they have an IRC channel xD
[11:54] <zerosmoke> thanks...except...now the sound hangs...
[11:54] <zerosmoke> lol
[11:55] <Stormx2> Well I wouldn't know. Using the netscape mail client right? Well I suppose it could be port issues, but I wouldn't have thought so. Gmail offers some excellent guides, has she followed them? Theres bound to be one on netscape...
[11:55] <zerosmoke> heard of this problem  beofre
[11:55] <socomm> zerosmoke: close out any other application and restart firefox.
[11:55] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: XD, are you talking about netscape on windows?
[11:55] <Asc> Anybody know how to get ssh X forwarding working?  I'm getting a "cannot open display" error when trying to start a program.
[11:55] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: Wrong channel mate...
[11:55] <Stormx2> ] GoldenDragon: Nah not really.
[11:55] <socomm> zerosmoke: another application might be accessing the sound card.
[11:55] <] GoldenDragon> heh
[11:55] <TGPO> ] -[erbie, http://www.debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/libd/libdvdcss/
[11:56] <] -[erbie> TGPO: great! thnx
[11:56] <socomm> I find it odd that on windows two applications can't read and write to a file at the same time, but more than one app can access the sound card.
[11:56] <zerosmoke> hmmm....you mean like gaim messenger?  lol
[11:56] <zerosmoke> seems to be working now
[11:56] <] GoldenDragon> funny, she just restarted her comp and it started working
[11:56] <] GoldenDragon> aight well.. thanks anyway Storm!
[11:56] <radioaktivstorm> Stormx2, thanks, Ill try this
[11:56] <zerosmoke> "I stole a baby!  That's just about as evil as it gets!"
[11:56] <socomm> On Unix various apps can access the same file, but no more than one app can access the sound card at once.
[11:56] <zerosmoke> thanks
[11:57] <zerosmoke> socomm
[11:57] <socomm> zerosmoke: NP.

[11:59] <nuts7> anyone know where the .xsession files are located?
[11:59] <zorba64> ~
[11:59] <nuts7> zorba64: you sure.. theres nuffing there :(
[12:00] <socomm> nuts7: usually in your home directory. You can also set a global xsession under /etc/x11 or something.
[12:00] <radioaktivstorm> sladen, when i try fdisk, it says its unable to open hda
[12:01] <] -[erbie> zorba64: I am a newb... how do I install libdvdread3?
