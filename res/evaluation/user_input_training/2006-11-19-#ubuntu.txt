[12:01] <lufis> sethk: I'
[12:01] <sethk> lufis, if you compile from source, the default is that the from source version will go into /usr/local instead of /usr
[12:01] <Wirelex> where are spanish servers, please?
[12:01] <theqkash> I can't see batch converting tool in GIMP:(
[12:01] <amonkey> what package would qt bindings be in? a script i'm trying to run wants them
[12:01] <jasontk> jamesrose: i don't want to disable eth0 per se, i just want the modprobe for the card not to hang the system :)
[12:01] <sethk> lufis, that means, as long as /usr/local/bin is in your execution search path before /bin, the compiled one will be used.
[12:01] <sethk> lufis, however, you can tell the source to use /usr instead of /usr/local, and then it will cover up the package manager version
[12:02] <theqkash> help plz
[12:02] <sethk> lufis, if you expect to go back to using the package manager version when it's available, then install to /usr/bin
[12:02] <Wirelex> thanks
[12:02] <sethk> lufis, sorry, /usr/local
[12:02] <ashika> theqkash, try updating GIMP.
[12:02] <Wirelex> bye
[12:02] <jasontk> jamesrose: technically i should replace the module with a new version that works obviously
[12:02] <theqkash> ashika: newest version available by synaptic
[12:02] <sethk> lufis, then run the program using the full path, that is, instead of typing in gaim, type in /usr/local/bin/gaim
[12:02] <theqkash> or apt like you want
[12:02] <Running_Aim> hi does anyone know what wm xfce uses?
[12:02] <factboy818181> hmm.... i compiled Gaim Beta 5 and forgot to remove gaim before, and now it's telling me to replace the version i compiled with beta 3 - any ideas?
[12:03] <crimsun> xfwm4, Running_Aim
[12:03] <Vuen_> Running_Aim: metacity afaik
[12:03] <Running_Aim> thanx allot
[12:03] <Vuen_> >.<
[12:03] <ashika> theqkash, sorry I dont knwo about gimp
[12:03] <crimsun> Versed: no, metacity's is gnome's default
[12:03] <crimsun> Versed: sorry
[12:03] <lufis> sethk: Yeah... I've been compiling apps myself and using checkinstall to generate a deb, then installing it. What I wanted to know was would everything be okay for multiple installed versions, i.e., installing beta6 when it is released (or whatever) and just uninstalling the old beta5 package
[12:03] <crimsun> Vuen_: ^^
[12:03] <fdoving> what is the gnome-way to run commands during login/session start?
[12:03] <lufis> sethk: I've had bad experiences with doing that before
[12:03] <theqkash> so nobody can help me in finding app to batch converting images to have smaller size?
[12:04] <lufis> theqkash: One sec, i'll link you up to an article
[12:04] <fdoving> theqkash: 'convert' it's in the imagemagick package.
[12:04] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[12:04] <nolimitsoya> could anyone recommend a cdripper for gtk, with integrity checking and flac encoding? would sound-juicer do this?
[12:04] <anton__> can you hear any audio, otacon?
[12:05] <sethk> lufis, bad experiences with putting the compiled version into /usr/local?  I do that frequently, and I've never had a problem.  I've done it with gaim specifically and not had a problem
[12:05] <sethk> lufis, you can certainly generate a deb if you want.  It's much much more work, but if you think it's worth the effort, then deb away.  :)
[12:05] <xamox> Is it possible to run disk druid once Ubuntu is installed? Say I install another harddrive and want to use it?
[12:06] <sethk> xamox, sure.  if you know the real name of the program.
[12:06] <sethk> xamox, it's either in /sbin or /usr/sbin
[12:06] <nolimitsoya> xamox, just manually edit you fstab ('man fstab' for a manual, and 'sudo nano /etc/fstab' to edit)
[12:06] <sethk> xamox, I don't use it, I use fdisk, but that's just because I prefer it
[12:07] <lufis> sethk: I have no idea how to put it into /usr/local/... I just thought it would be best to use apt to handle the compiled version so that when I want to install a newer unofficial version I can just uninstall the old. Is that okay?
[12:07] <ashika> xamox, did you try fdisk
[12:07] <nolimitsoya> xamox, use gparted to partition and format
[12:07] <lufis> theqkash: here you go: http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tip/16524.html
[12:07] <xamox> sethk:  nolimitsoya: ashika: thx.
[12:07] <sethk> lufis, if you download the source, and build it, and don't do anything at all, it ends up in /usr/local.  You don't have to do anything.  You have to do something to _not_ put it into /usr/local
[12:07] <theqkash> lufis: thanks
[12:07] <ashika> xamox, if you want try typing in diskdruid and see what it says.
[12:08] <lufis> theqkash: No problemo. Ask if you need anything else :)
[12:08] <sethk> lufis, your idea about using apt is fine, surely
[12:08] <sethk> lufis, it's more work, but certainly if you are more comfortable with it, there is no reason not to do it that way.
[12:08] <lufis> sethk: Ah. okay, but what about compiling newer versions than the compiled? would it just replace the older one?
[12:08] <lufis> sethk: in /usr/local *
[12:08] <sethk> lufis, yes, if you compile and don't change the target, and then build a later version later, it will replace the earlier version
[12:09] <lufis> sethk: Ahh, okay.
[12:09] <jerrcs> hello i need help..

=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[12:10] <nolimitsoya> isnt anyone in here using a cd ripper that they are happy with?! please recommend it if you do, and if its checks for integrity.
[12:10] <jerrcs> Basically, I get a lot of problems when I'm trying to compile something
[12:10] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ok, now it starts up with the computer, but every time I start it up, I have to unmute surround, front, and all those channels and such along with my recording stuff, it seems my volume preferences aren't saved...?

[12:11] <eduhat> anyone here use fluxbox?
[12:11] <lufis> jerrcs: Also ensure you have dependencies installed
[12:11] <jerrcs> alreadyhave it nolimitsoya
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> boink, thank you. does it do data integrity checking?
[12:11] <jerrcs> lufis: well what dependencies do i need for that?
[12:11] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[12:11] <nolimitsoya> !anyone | eduhat
[12:11] <ubotu> eduhat: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:11] <jerrcs> it looks like something is messed up in a include file.
[12:11] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: well, see, when you installed that alsa-driver made with checkinstall, it SCREWED what Debian [&Ubuntu]  do for infrastructure. Yet another reason checkinstalled packages are BAD.
[12:12] <LjL> jerrcs: the fact that errors are given in the include file doesn't necessarily mean the actual problems are in the include file
[12:12] <lufis> jerrcs: It depends on the program. What are you compiling?
[12:12] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: so. apt-get --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base
[12:12] <eduhat> how do i use fbdesk in fluxbox?
[12:12] <jerrcs> lufis: Mangos.
[12:12] <boink> thou shalt not mess up package management
[12:12] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: in the future, don't stab yourself in the face and ask us to clean up, thanks! :-)
[12:13] <lufis> jerrcs: Look in the README file, dependencies should be listed there or in another text file in the tarball. Then install the necessary packages
[12:13] <nolimitsoya> eduhat, tried man fbdesk?
[12:13] <jerrcs> lufis: the readme isn't very helpful
[12:13] <lufis> jerrcs: Also, the packages you need are the ones with -dev extensions

[12:15] <ashika> amrnet, yes www.google.com
[12:16] <amrnet> this is not an answer
[12:16] <amrnet> been googling for a while now
[12:16] <jerrcs> lufis: yeah..
[12:16] <jerrcs> They don't really give any information about dependencies.

[12:17] <Morrissey> Hi, when I do a "fglrxinfo" i get a: "OpenGL version string: 1.3.1091 (X4.3.0-8.28.8)"    but most forums show that they get a version 2.0(something) ... how and do I need to upgrade?
[12:17] <lufis> jerrcs: What is it that you're compiling though? What function does the app do, I mean
[12:17] <jerrcs> lufis: well, if you must know, its actually a opensource WoW server.
[12:17] <jerrcs> http://sourceforge.net/projects/mangos/
[12:18] <lufis> jerrcs: Ohhh
[12:18] <Vix> Anyone got Xgl/Compiz working on their system?

[12:18] <midgetg0at> Hey guys, installed 6.10, cant get sound blaster pci512 to work...any ideas? I get an error on boot "Failed to initialize HAL" - which is the only idication that something is wrong. This was a clean install. Any ideas?
[12:19] <Vix> Something something Layer...
[12:19] <lufis> jerrcs: Do you have the build-essential package installed?
[12:19] <Vix> Hardware something layer?
[12:20] <nolimitsoya> Vix, hardware abstraction layer
[12:20] <midgetg0at> abstraction - iknow what it means...just not how to fix it :)
[12:20] <midgetg0at> or if it's even relevant.
[12:21] <Vix> I dunno... :)
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> midgetg0at, how do you know your soundcard is causing it?
[12:21] <Vix> Yay, DVD complete.
[12:21] <midgetg0at> the information on ubuntu and google dont help. everyone having problems w/ it are usually upgrading.
[12:21] <Kalist00> whats the file called to generate a xorg.conf?
[12:21] <bsmntbombdood> why doesn't ubuntu come with make,gcc installed ?!?
[12:22] <midgetg0at> how do i know my soundcard is causing it..it being the HAL error? I'm happy ignoring the error, if i can get the soundcard to work.
[12:22] <Vix> what are the apt-gets to get XGL/Compiz going?
[12:22] <Pelo> bsmntbombdood,  because it relies on ppl using the packages in synpatic
[12:22] <crimsun> midgetg0at: the two are not strongly correlated.
[12:22] <hondje> bsmntbombdood: because it's rarely needed by newbies, and non-newbies have no problem typing apt-get install build-essential
[12:22] <jerrcs> lufis: Yes- I do have build-essential
[12:22] <midgetg0at> k, i only mentioned that as a way to debug it, if it was relevant. lets not focus on the hal error. lets focus on no sound from sb pci512
[12:22] <crimsun> midgetg0at: please pastebin the output from ``lspci -nv && dmesg && tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat''
[12:23] <midgetg0at> k, sec.
[12:23] <bsmntbombdood> I can't compile these wifi drivers without make, and I can't apt-get because I can't compile the wifi drivers

[12:43] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: didn't you do that with --reinstall?
[12:44] <JoshJ> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/9dabe251.html  <== What's up with line 7 there?
[12:44] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: well, you had me a few days ago install the feisty alsa-base which was 1.0.13
[12:44] <lurker99> witless: well, it works for me...  (xchat 2.4.4)  or do -> Window -> Ignore List -> Add.
[12:44] <civing> sethk, thanks! I'll try that
[12:44] <drbreen> the rigth side of my monitor does not work and i cannot afford to give my laptop away for 2 weeks or so, got stuff to do. anyone knows how i can make resolution 512x768 ?
[12:44] <sethk> civing, good, that usually works for what you are describing.
[12:45] <civing> sethk, ok, here we go =)
[12:45] <sethk> drbreen, that's tough, because you need to tell the hardware 1024x768 but then tell the wm 512x768
[12:45] <sethk> drbreen, you can set a virtual resolution of 512x768 within a physical of 1024x768
[12:46] <drbreen> sethk: so there is no way to tell X to only use the left side ?
[12:46] <sethk> drbreen, that might get something usable.
[12:46] <witless> lurker99: thanks, it is accessible via the Window menu
[12:46] <sethk> drbreen, try the virtual resolution.  at least, that should get it to open new windows in the visible part.
[12:46] <Zambezi> How strong is the encryption if it's unchanged in SSH? Is it 768 bit?
[12:47] <sethk> drbreen, it might reject it, but it's worth trying.  usuallyl virtual is larger than physical, and I never tried it the other way around.
[12:47] <sethk> Zambezi, check the ssh config files in /tec
[12:47] <sethk> Zambezi, /etc, that is
[12:47] <drbreen> sethk: how does this work ? i tried something with virtual screens but then X always zoomed in and i had a real res of 512x384 or so with virtual 512x768
[12:48] <name> http://segfaulthunter.se.ohost.de/futubug.jpg <anyone got any idea why the picture is broken?
[12:48] <dv_> its not
[12:48] <name> it is
[12:48] <dv_> this is interlacing
[12:48] <name> it looks crap
[12:48] <JoshJ> not sure what you mean by broken
[12:48] <JoshJ> oh
[12:48] <Zambezi> sethk, I'll have a look. Thanks.
[12:48] <JoshJ> that's interlacing, yeah
[12:48] <LjL> name: does that anything do do with ubuntu?
[12:49] <sethk> drbreen, that's not surprising; I said I hadn't tried virtual smaller than physical.  but in that case did you specify both?  also, make sure that there is only one choice of physical, so it doesn't try to find the most sensible physical to go with your virtual.
[12:49] <LjL> have anything to do
[12:49] <bradley_> how does rhythmbox interact with last.fm?
=== Deaigo743 is now known as Deaigo
[12:49] <name> yes, ubuntu's ogle produces it
[12:49] <dv_> ah yes is this from a dvd?
[12:49] <brian|lfs> Does anyone in here run ubuntu server I was jsut wondering if tis any good?
[12:49] <name> dv_: indeed
[12:49] <dv_> name, which ubuntu distro?
[12:49] <b3tzi> hello
[12:49] <name> edgy
[12:49] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so should I install the edgy version again?
[12:49] <dv_> hm
[12:49] <LjL> name: well the frame was interlaced, you need to set some sort of de-interlacing algorithm
[12:49] <name> but had problems with that before
[12:49] <dv_> yes, I encountered this too
[12:49] <drbreen> sethk: i did not try to limit the choices of real
[12:49] <sethk> brian|lfs, you aren't going to find people on #ubuntu who will say no, use some other distro.  :)
[12:49] <wikityler> is there a way to custom set the resolution and refresh rate for my monitor?
[12:49] <dv_> usually deinterlacing is applied,
[12:50] <JoshJ> sethk: wrong
[12:50] <midgetg0at> pci=routeirq didnt do anything....how would i correct the acpi problem?
[12:50] <name> the strange thing is, some dvds do work
[12:50] <dv_> but I am not sure how to do this with ogle
[12:50] <sethk> drbreen, try it, nothing to lose really, although the odds aren't great.
[12:50] <nothlit> Why do I need to do a dist-upgrade to upgrade frozen-bubble?
[12:50] <dv_> yes, some dvds do not use interlacing
[12:50] <crimsun> midgetg0at: try booting with pci=noacpi
[12:50] <dv_> name, tried with xine?
[12:50] <name> but all are futurama ones
[12:50] <sethk> brian|lfs, server is just a set of packages to install, not a different o/s.  I do use it, and it works well for me.
[12:50] <midgetg0at> heh, it takes forever for ubuntu to mount this drive....anything else you suggest before i reboot?
[12:50] <LjL> nothlit: Ubuntu releases only get security fixes and fixes to serious bugs. they don't get new releases of programs

[12:51] <b3tzi> I have a question: how can I unrar a splited rar archive?
[12:51] <sethk> midgetg0at, what kind of drive?  what size?  what file system?
[12:51] <dv_> or kaffeine-xine / totem-xine (dvd via gstreamer is a little fishy)
[12:51] <Dravas> FUDGE
[12:51] <Dravas> I am having Video problems with vlc/compiz
[12:52] <nothlit> LjL, nm I reread aptitudes man page, its because the upgrade needs to install a lib (extra package)
[12:52] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Dravas about compiz
[12:52] <midgetg0at> I donno crimsun...i ahvent opened this box in a while.
[12:52] <LjL> nothlit, yes unless you're particularly lucky trying to install an Edgy package on Dapper will result in some broken dependencies
[12:52] <Vix> sethk: Sorry. I just burned an Ubuntu DVD, am tryink to boot with it, but after I choose one of the menu options, it says Unpacking vmlinuz.gz.... Booting kernel..... and then just hangs.
[12:53] <midgetg0at> hrm, ok, i'll try that boot option.
[12:53] <sethk> Vix, try using the text mode install on the alternate cd
[12:53] <Pelo> Vix,  might be a borked dvd,  try buring it again

[12:53] <b3tzi> :x
[12:53] <sethk> Vix, with the dvd I think (but I'm not certain) that there is only one dvd.
[12:53] <Vix> sethk: I was using the 64-bit image btw.
[12:53] <sethk> Vix, what pelo said is also worth checking
[12:53] <brian|lfs> anyone have any luck with dmraid in ubuntu before?
[12:53] <midgetg0at> i boot to cd, select the option to boot ubuntu and f6 to enter boot options and then just enter "pci=noacpi" correct?

[12:54] <Vix> The AMD Mobile Sempron is 64-bit, right?
[12:55] <Aldoliel> Vix: Maybe, maybe not
[12:55] <sethk> Vix, I'd have to check
[12:55] <Vix> I think it is...
[12:55] <Aldoliel> Try the x86 image?
[12:56] <Vix> It's a DVD+RW, should I just reburn it?
[12:56] <nothlit> LjL, oh I'm not doing anything like that, Its just frozen-bubble was being upgraded from seveas' repo and I didn't even know that the repo had it

[12:56] <DiMiTRiS> I have a quick question! Does automatix2 install flash 9 on dapper?
[12:56] <Vix> I don't have any... XD
[12:56] <CorpseFeeder> hi. What exactly is supposed to happen when I choose "hibernate" from the shutdown menu? I was wondering, because all that happens for me is it starts the screen saver then after a while the monitor turns off but the computer keeps running. It doesn't stop using power and certainly does not restore any open apps when I restart it. (The only way I can find to restart it from hibernate is to press the reset switch).

[12:57] <DiMiTRiS> Ok thnx for your replies
[12:57] <nothlit> Seveas, does that mean I don't need libsdl-pango1 ?
[12:57] <Vix> The CD image would be faster to download..
[12:58] <sethk> Vix, you don't have a cd/r blank?
[12:58] <b3tzi> I have a question: how can I unrar a splited rar archive?
[12:58] <Seveas> nothlit, correct
[12:58] <Vix> Funnily, no.
[12:58] <brian|lfs> I'm burning edgy I hope to be able to do dmraid
[12:58] <brian|lfs> on my new rig
[12:58] <halex-ab> b3tzi, do you have the 'unrar' package installed?
[12:58] <sethk> Vix, I believe you can burn the cd image to a dvd, but that's second hand and I haven't tried myself.  That is, I believe it will work.  Of course you _can_ do it either way.  :)
[12:59] <nothlit> Seveas, ok, thanks for the info :)
[12:59] <b3tzi> halex-ab, unrar-free is already the newest version
[12:59] <Vix> sethk: Howzat?
[12:59] <b3tzi> yes
[12:59] <Beep> How can I get the install CD to not "load additional modules"  for nic-modules-.. etc..  it keeps locking up at that step.
[12:59] <sethk> Vix, use cdrecord, exactly the way you would if it were a cd/r blank
[12:59] <Vix> Ok.
[12:59] <Vix> I'm on windows, using ImgBurn. :)
[01:00] <halex-ab> b3tzi, I'm using unrar, rather than unrar-free
[01:00] <b3tzi> halex-ab, I know it's better but I can't figure out how to install it
[01:00] <halex-ab> It's in the Multiverse repos..
[01:00] <name> i solved it!
[01:00] <halex-ab> Just enable it, and install the unrar package..
[01:00] <Vix> sethk: I'll go for the x86 CD...
[01:00] <name> dv_: ~ $ mplayer -vf pp=fd dvd://1 -dvd-device /dev/hdc
[01:01] <b3tzi> can you PM me those repos?
[01:01] <Vix> sethk: Safest.
[01:01] <sethk> Vix, ok.  I didn't say that processor isn't 64, I said I don't know.  but yes, 32 will run in either case.
[01:01] <b3tzi> I think I screwed my sources.list
[01:01] <Mantice> Whats that mp3 server for ubuntu called ?
[01:01] <clearzen> Is there a way you can force all communication to take place using ssh on a entire subnet?
[01:01] <Aldoliel> Mantice, Shoutcast? Icecast?
[01:02] <Vix> sethk: Is the 64 disro a big improvement? I don't have windows x64 so I can't tell?
[01:02] <Mantice> No it dont stream music
[01:02] <Mantice> It like makes a webpage
[01:02] <Mantice> of all your mp3s
[01:02] <nolimitsoya> when trying to play a dvd using vlc (or any program for that matter) i get an attempt to read, and then a sudden abort. when trying to copy files off a dvd i get the error 'failed to read data, input/output error'. what gives?
[01:02] <Mantice> and if you click on the link you can download them.
[01:02] <sethk> Vix, no, in fact, I've seen cases where the 64 bit version ran slower.  when it does help, the gain is in the area of 10%
[01:02] <Vix> sethk: Oh, ok... :)
[01:02] <nolimitsoya> nolimitsoya, doesnt matter what disc i try...
[01:02] <halex-ab> Mantice, copy all your MP3s into your /var/www directory..? heh :)
[01:03] <Vix> sethk: Any idea how many times I can rewrite a DVD+RW?
[01:03] <halex-ab> Not sure really..
[01:03] <sethk> b3tzi, edit the file and take out whatever you think is causing the problem.
[01:03] <Lahey> is Xarchiver in Ubuntu synaptic?
[01:03] <nolimitsoya> Vix, ca 1000x, depending of the quality and data written
[01:03] <Vaske_Car> How to install SoundMax drivers for motheboard? This is what I get output on shell http://pastebin.ca/252044
[01:03] <Vix> Nice!!
[01:03] <LjL> Mantice: "apt-cache search mp3 web". type that. and if you get no (or very few) results, enable universe
[01:03] <sethk> Vix, I haven't used them, so I can't say, but the number should be reasonable.
[01:04] <Vix> Yeah, 1000 sounds right.
[01:04] <sethk> nolimitsoya, you've use dvd+rw rewriting multiple times with good results?
[01:04] <halex-ab> Lahey, it's in dapper's main repo, so if you're using dapper, yes..
[01:04] <LjL> Mantice, it might be gnump3d that you're looking for anyway
[01:04] <halex-ab> Lahey, wait, it's in Edgy too..
[01:04] <nolimitsoya> sethk, yes. what would a bad result be?
[01:05] <sethk> nolimitsoya, a bad result would be that you rewrote, and you couldn't read.
[01:05] <Lahey> i am using dapper LTS
[01:05] <halex-ab> In that case, it should in there..
[01:05] <sethk> nolimitsoya, the "coaster" result, as the expression goes.
[01:05] <Lahey> even better halex-ab
[01:05] <compengi> does anybody knows a program that can burn mpg to vcd?
[01:05] <nolimitsoya> no ideas on my dvd playback issue? works fine with (reg1) iso:s. just reg2 discs thats pearshaped.
[01:06] <startswithz> hello everyone
[01:06] <startswithz> Can anyone give me a bit of assistance?  I'm having a hard time getting flash content to run in Firefox
[01:06] <Mantice> I think it was gnump3d
[01:06] <nolimitsoya> sethk, has happend, but thats just something that happens when writing cd:s. a reformat and new write solves it.
[01:07] <halex-ab> startswithz, what version of Flash are you running? Well, firstly, do you have Flash installed?
[01:07] <sethk> nolimitsoya, ok, I meant a case where you could no longer use the blank, should have been more explicit.
[01:07] <RebornDV> please bare with my stupid question... new gnome user... how do i enable 3d acceleration with my vid card? ati mobile x200
[01:07] <startswithz> yeah
[01:07] <startswithz> I just installed macromedia 7
[01:07] <startswithz> I'm on Ubuntu 6.10 with firefox 2.0
[01:07] <halex-ab> So, is it just a site that doesn't work?
[01:07] <sethk> nolimitsoya, with cd/rw there are a couple of different erase types, and when the quick erase doesn't work, you use the longer erase.  Not sure if that applies to dvd+rw
[01:07] <startswithz> I'm trying to get line rider to work
[01:07] <nolimitsoya> sethk, no, never happend. did you do something strange, like writing dvd+rw with a dvdwriter only supporting dvd-rw?
[01:08] <sethk> nolimitsoya, no, I'm asking to help decide which dvd format to use
[01:08] <Mantice> startswithz: I got half my school into playing that flash game :)
[01:08] <sethk> nolimitsoya, I've only used dvd-ram so far
[01:08] <RebornDV> okie dokie
[01:08] <halex-ab> starkruzr, so, it just won't run?
[01:08] <Vix> nolimitsoya: Aren't most rewriters DVD+/iRW?
[01:08] <startswithz> well it kinda loads but doesn't
[01:08] <Vix> *+/-
[01:08] <startswithz> I see the "click here to start" but it won't respond
[01:09] <nolimitsoya> sethk, ok, well dvd-ram cant be formated. perhaps thats why things go pearshaped?
[01:09] <startswithz> additionally there is this weird little tiny line that shows up
[01:09] <feross> [xfgk
[01:09] <halex-ab> startswithz, You _could_ try Flash 9
[01:09] <nolimitsoya> Vix, new drives are, but back in the days...
[01:09] <Vix> Oh
[01:09] <sethk> nolimitsoya, not sure what you mean by that.  with dvd-ram you use mkfs; specifically I use mkfs.ext3 with it.  You can recreate the file system as many times as you like.
[01:09] <startswithz> would that require me to use wine? or is flash 9 out for linux?
[01:09] <b3tzi> my unrar works
[01:09] <b3tzi> thanks guys
[01:09] <b3tzi> :)
[01:10] <Vix> nolimitsoya: Do you think I could burn a CD image to the dvd? The DVD isos are just so huge.
[01:10] <Mantice> Hehhe I found some gnump3d servers through google mhahah
[01:10] <nolimitsoya> sethk, what i mean is that sectors are physical. those litte squares on the disc, you see...
[01:10] <halex-ab> startswithz, Flash 9 beta is available for Linux, yes..
[01:10] <startswithz> cool where can I find it?
[01:10] <kitche> !flash9
[01:10] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[01:11] <nolimitsoya> Vix, not sure what you mean, but you can write any type of iso to any type of medium. you wase a whole deal of space though, writing a 700mb iso to a 9.4gb medium
[01:11] <startswithz> ok and I want the installer or the stand alone?
[01:11] <Vix> nolimitsoya: Any idea what comes on the 3.5GB DVD ISO?
[01:11] <sethk> nolimitsoya, I've not had problems with dvd-ram, regardless of the squares.  :)  It is slow, of course, but all dvd is relatively slow.
[01:11] <Vix> Anyway, my DVD is only 4.7GB
[01:11] <tim167> i want to download several files from a page, but some have the same name, Aria download manager says 'already downloaded' but it is in fact another file (other location) can Aria auto-rename this file in that case ?
[01:12] <kitche> Vix: it has more packages
[01:12] <nolimitsoya> Vix, iso of what?
[01:12] <Vix> nolimitsoya: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/release/
[01:12] <Vix> kitche: Useful for setting up laptop wireless perhaps?
[01:12] <jirwin> anyone know how to disable acpi in edgy?
[01:12] <nolimitsoya> Vix, ah, as said, just more packages. pretty useless, if you ask me...
[01:12] <f1assistance> what is the su password for Ubuntu 6.10?
[01:13] <kitche> !root|f1assistance
[01:13] <Vix> Ok, I'm hoping wl works out of the box
[01:13] <ubotu> f1assistance: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:13] <kitche> Vix: what's the chipset of your wireless?
[01:13] <xor> ubuntu makes me want to vomit
[01:13] <Vix> Hmm, let me see.
[01:13] <f1assistance> kitche: thanks!
[01:13] <xor> Just thought i'd tell you that
[01:13] <tim167> Is there a download manager that auto-renames files according to their size? (to prevent overwriting)
[01:13] <Pelo> xor,  take it elsewhere
[01:14] <sethk> tim167, firefox uses a different name if you download the same file more than once, regardless of the size.
[01:14] <Morrissey> Hi, do I need composite?? Unfortunally ATI doesnt support it with DRI yet ... but what is it? Can I use ie: Bery/compiz?
[01:14] <tim167> yes but its 100 files, too many for click and point dl
[01:14] <AlienX> i don't suppose there is a no-gui install on the normal edgy live CD is there?
[01:14] <Seveas> Morrissey, no. Don't you love ati?
[01:15] <sethk> tim167, I know, but firefox is using something at the file level that you can probably use yourself.
[01:15] <f1assistance> kitche: not working?
[01:15] <sethk> tim167, did you check wget?
[01:15] <kitche> AlienX: no it's the alternative cd is what you want probably
[01:15] <sethk> tim167, I think I remember a wget feature that might do what you need.
[01:15] <kitche> f1assistance: sudo <command> is how you use sudo
[01:15] <Vix_> kitche: Ralink something.
[01:15] <AlienX> kitche, that's what I thought. Thanks :)
[01:15] <tim167> sethk: I use Aria now, Wget doesnt work with flashgot here
[01:15] <CorpseFeeder> hibernate don't work for me. How would I go about finding where the problem lies?
[01:15] <sethk> tim167, ok, don't know flashgot
[01:16] <kitche> Vix_: hmm it might work out of the box some Ralink's work and others don't
[01:16] <jirwin> is there any way to pass boot params with the edgy installer?
[01:16] <sethk> CorpseFeeder, what happens?
[01:16] <jirwin> or do I need the alternate disc?
[01:16] <Morrissey> Seveas, hm :) ok, thanks
[01:16] <nolimitsoya> jirwin, press f6 (or f5, or whatever....)
[01:16] <clearzen> How can I force machines on my network to use ssh?
[01:16] <tim167> sethk: I'll try to get gwet to work, can i use it without flashgot ? (outside firefox then ?)
[01:17] <tim167> *wget
[01:17] <jirwin> clearzen: don't route telnet traffic?
[01:17] <sethk> tim167, yes, but remember, I said I don't know flashgot.
[01:17] <CorpseFeeder> sethk: the screensaver starts, then the monitor turns off and that is as far as it gets, then there is no way to get the computer back on except pressing reset button and no apps a restored when it restarts.
[01:17] <Vix_> I think I'll try reburning the 64-bit dvd...
[01:17] <astronouth7303> how do I move data from thunderbird to evolution?
[01:17] <tim167> sethk: is there a gui for wget ?
[01:17] <sethk> clearzen, you can block other types of connections.  people could get around that by tunneling, potentially.

[01:17] <Seveas> tim167, gwget
[01:17] <startswithz> how do I create a root user account in Ubuntu?
[01:17] <sethk> tim167, I'm sure there is, someone will know
[01:18] <Seveas> !root | startswithz
[01:18] <ubotu> startswithz: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[01:18] <sethk> tim167, see, before I could even say someone will know, someone knew  :)
[01:18] <clearzen> jirwin: I want all incoming and outgoing communication to use ssh. But not disallow other types of communication
[01:18] <Malachi> I accidentally hit the Revert button on the Articulate Menu Editor, and now 1) My menu is all awry, and 2) The changes aren't immediate
[01:18] <sethk> startswithz, you have a root account, but root login is disabled
[01:18] <startswithz> right
[01:18] <jirwin> clearzen: tell your users to use ssh then
[01:18] <sethk> startswithz, the system cannot run without a root account
[01:18] <tim167> Seveas, sethk: thanks
[01:18] <startswithz> how do I enable it?
[01:18] <djm62> OK, whenever I type a random phrase into the location bar on epiphany and press enter, it tells me it isn't a valid url: is there any way of getting it to search the web on anything that isn't a valid URL? it's a nagging annoyance
[01:18] <Seveas> startswithz, read what ubotu wrot
[01:18] <CorpseFeeder> sethk: the computer continues to run after the monitor turns off.. it does not power down any drives or fans.
[01:18] <sethk> startswithz, you can set the root password, but some people (other than myself) think that sudo is safer
[01:19] <djm62> I've looked in preferences
[01:19] <kitche> startswithz: go to that link and it will have the answer
=== Daylighter is now known as Daylighter_
[01:19] <sethk> CorpseFeeder, I'd start by running the command you are using to hibernate under strace.  If you are using the gui, you'll have to track down what program is actually used.
[01:19] <tim167> Seveas: does Gwget rename files if they have the same name but come from a different url ?
[01:19] <Seveas> tim167, iirc yes
[01:20] <Seveas> even if they're from the same url
[01:20] <tim167> Seveas: great, I'm synaptic-ing it now :p
[01:21] <asdfasdfdd> heya, ubuntu cant read my hard drive's partition info, how can i remedy this?
[01:21] <Seveas> asdfasdfdd, sulphuric acid
[01:21] <asdfasdfdd> i wish
[01:21] <abc1Dc> hey
[01:21] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, what kind of drive?  as in, IDE, SATA, SCSI?
[01:22] <asdfasdfdd> sata
[01:22] <nolimitsoya> when trying to play a dvd using vlc (or any program for that matter) i get an attempt to read, and then a sudden abort. when trying to copy files off a dvd i get the error 'failed to read data, input/output error'. what gives? reading iso:s work just fine, though the only iso i have is reg1, and the dvd:s i try to read are reg2. would that matter?
[01:22] <abc1Dc> Ma anybody help me ? I have a prob
[01:22] <abc1Dc> May*
[01:22] <jrib> !ask | abc1Dc
[01:22] <ubotu> abc1Dc: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:22] <swanfl> what's your problem?
[01:22] <abc1Dc> I want to install ubuntu
[01:22] <LjL> well, i don't call that a problem
[01:22] <jrib> abc1Dc: ok, how far are you in the process?
[01:22] <_tcc> ha
[01:23] <halex-ab> LjL, I think there's more.. :)
[01:23] <abc1Dc> and everything is all right. But if I reboot ubuntu the first time Ubuntu doesn't work
[01:23] <Seveas> !doesn'twork|abc1dc
[01:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about doesn'twork - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:23] <Seveas> hmm
[01:23] <LjL> !doesn't work
[01:23] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[01:23] <Seveas> /kill LjL
[01:23] <abc1Dc> It stops at "Starting hotplug subsystem"
[01:24] <abc1Dc> And nothing works....
[01:24] <Soaking> Hello
[01:24] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, the installer shows an empty space and fdisk -l gives Cannot open /dev/sda, its sata, any ideas?
[01:24] <Seveas> abc1Dc, which version of Ubuntu is that?
[01:24] <Seveas> hotplug has been dead for a while
[01:24] <Soaking> I dont see any users in the user list, what's up with that?
[01:24] <Seveas> Soaking, we're not here
[01:24] <Seveas> Soaking, alternatively, try typing /names
[01:25] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, could be that support for the SATA controller chip set in your box isn't loaded, or isn't available.
[01:25] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, do you know what chipset it is?
[01:25] <abc1Dc> wait a minut
[01:25] <asdfasdfdd> ubuntu dapper installed properly
[01:25] <asdfasdfdd> nforce 4
[01:25] <Seveas> asdfasdfdd, try ubuntu edgy
[01:25] <abc1Dc> ubuntu 5.10
[01:25] <asdfasdfdd> i am
[01:25] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, ok, dapper installing proves that it's available, and that the dapper install kernel includes it.
[01:25] <Seveas> abc1Dc, that's ancient
[01:26] <asdfasdfdd> im talkin to you on it :P
[01:26] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you can install dapper and then upgrade
[01:26] <Seveas> abc1Dc, try the latest version
[01:26] <asdfasdfdd> my dapper install is corrupt
[01:26] <spencerk> hi everyone, is there a reset command for when an audio app force-quits and clogs all sound? snd-reset or something?
[01:26] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you can run dapper, find out which SATA module is being used, and see if there is a way to tell edgy to load it.
[01:26] <asdfasdfdd> windows still boots right though
[01:27] <abc1Dc> Ok thnx
[01:27] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, of course, if dapper works, why wouldn't windows work?
[01:27] <abc1Dc> I'll try
[01:27] <dibblego> I want to have multiple instances of a read-only directory, which you'd normally do with symlinks, but I want one file within that directory to be different - can think of a *good* way of doing it
[01:27] <asdfasdfdd> dapper is corrupt
[01:27] <asdfasdfdd> grub wont boot it
[01:27] <tim167> i get (Gwget:18159): CRITICAL **: view_selection_func: assertion `gwget_data_get_selected()!=NULL' failed
[01:27] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, well, I'm not that judgemental  :)
[01:27] <LjL> dibblego: unionfs perhaps
[01:27] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you mean it used to work, but became corrupted?
[01:28] <dibblego> LjL, I'll take a look, thanks
[01:28] <kitche> tim167: does that crash gwget? sicne I see those errors all the time and they don't do much really
[01:28] <bingnet922> hi room, supposing I want to mv /tmp/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/text /tmp/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/text.txt How can I do that without typing the same path for the destination? Is there an operator like . or ~ that would mean "relative to source?"
[01:28] <noobie0057> Hi I'm having trouble accessing administrative tools, and updating the OS,  if I type gksu disks-admin I get an error message "sudo: unable to lookup computer-name via gethostbyname()"
[01:28] <abc1Dc> Well I'll try
[01:28] <asdfasdfdd> yea after i reinstalledwindows and tried installing grub on the windows partition, not knowing i had to specify the linux partition
[01:29] <tim167> kitche: it worked for a while but crashed once, first time i use it tho
[01:29] <jrib> noobie0057: post the contents of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
[01:29] <jrib> noobie0057: (on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org )
[01:29] <asdfasdfdd> nf 4 should have support
[01:29] <kitche> bingnet922: ./text.txt can be your destination sicne . means folder your in now
[01:29] <eduhat> hey guys, i need help with setting up wireless, i know my card uses the wlan driver, but how would i set that up?
[01:29] <halex-ab> bingnet922, just type the filename for the destination
[01:30] <bingnet922> halex: THANK YOU!
[01:30] <noobie0057> jrib: file not found
[01:30] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you should be installing grub on the mbr
[01:30] <jrib> noobie0057: both?
[01:30] <noobie0057> yeah,, scary?
[01:30] <halex-ab> bingnet922, np! You should end up with something like mv /etc/test/t.conf m.conf
[01:31] <jrib> noobie0057: yeah, kind of strange.  Did your install go ok?
[01:31] <asdfasdfdd> where is the mbr physically? is it a reserved space or on a partition?
[01:31] <jrib> anyone know what package creates /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname?
[01:31] <LjL> asdfasdfdd: it's at the first sectors of the disk
[01:31] <noobie0057> jrib:  never had a problem, ubuntu been great
[01:31] <tim167> gwget crashed again
[01:31] <Sobko> hello
[01:31] <Sobko> how to delete crash file
[01:31] <steffl> jrib: your editor ;-)
[01:31] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, the mbr is the first sector on the drive
[01:32] <asdfasdfdd> k, but when i reinstalled grub i had to specify where grub files would be (on my ubuntu install) am i right?
[01:32] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, yes
[01:32] <noobie0057> jrib: I did update the /etc/hosts file once,, found one on the net to prevent advertisements,, it worked fine,,, I don't know why it's missing.. I probablly backed it up.. but not  /etc/hostname
[01:32] <kitche> jrib: /etc/hosts seem to come from lessdisks-terminal
[01:32] <eduhat> hey guys, i need help with setting up wireless, i know my card uses the wlan driver, but how would i set my card up with the wlan driver, i have downloaded the .tar.gz, so im ready for anything, how would i do this?
[01:32] <bingnet922> halex: it didn't work using cp, stderror=cp: omitting directory '[sourcedir] '
[01:32] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, but it's possible to install grub to the partition and use another boot loader, and I meant that this isn't what you want to be doing.
[01:33] <Sobko> how to delete or folder
[01:33] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, yes, you do have to tell grub where to find its files
[01:33] <LjL> kitche: apt-file sometimes fools you ;)
[01:33] <kitche> LjL: I looked on packages.ubuntu.com
[01:33] <sethk> Sobko, if it is empty, rmdir.   if it has files and you are sure you want to delete them, then   rm -fr /directory-name
[01:33] <jrib> noobie0057: well try creating /etc/hosts with "ubuntu"  and /etc/hostname with "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost ubuntu"   without quotes.  And hcange "ubuntu" to whatever hostname you want (in both files)
[01:33] <asdfasdfdd> k, i tried reinstalling grub specifying the windows partition several times before i used the ubuntu partition and now it wont boot
[01:33] <sethk> Sobko, either the full path to the directory, or a relative path
[01:34] <ashika> Anyone need help?
[01:34] <Sobko> rm _usr_bin_xchat.1000.crash
[01:34] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, probably you didn't get the install parameters exactly right yet.
[01:34] <Sobko> it true
[01:34] <sethk> Sobko, rm, without any flags, can't remove a directory
[01:34] <noobie0057> jrib: sorry,, maybe I am mistaken,, if I type the command  "type /etc/hosts" I get a file not found but if I cd to that directory and do an ls I do see the file
[01:34] <LjL> kitche: whichever. the point is, that package gives you a "tiny Unix" for diskless terminals, that's probably why it contains an /etc/hosts... but the actual /etc/hosts one normally has comes from somewhere else, i bet
[01:34] <Sobko> o
[01:34] <sethk> Sobko, the -r, recursive, allows rm to remove a directory and all the files in the directory
[01:34] <asdfasdfdd> now i cant reinstall grub again though.. i cant see my partitions
[01:34] <kitche> LjL: I know that there is base/hostname but that only has bin/hostname
[01:35] <sethk> Sobko, rmdir can be used to delete an empty directory
[01:35] <jrib> noobie0057: try "cat /etc/hosts"
[01:35] <LjL> kitche, post-installation scripts can create files as well
[01:35] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, sounds like your mbr got clobbered, and you need to reconstruct it.
[01:35] <asdfasdfdd> how might that be done without reinstalling windows
[01:35] <noobie0057> jrib: yes that worked,, the file is there
[01:35] <kitche> LjL: then I m betting it's probably base/hostname then
[01:36] <asdfasdfdd> i hate talkin to windows reps on phone
[01:36] <jrib> noobie0057: ok do the same for the other file and put the contents on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[01:36] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you can reconstruct it with fdisk.  the trick is knowing where the partitions start and end
[01:36] <bingnet922> Halex, ashika: Yikes! "~$mv /tmp/1/2/3/file file.txt" resulted in deletion of "file!"
[01:36] <Sobko> can i delete log folder
[01:36] <asdfasdfdd> well i dont know that, how can i find out?
[01:37] <jrib> bingnet922: it got moved to your current directory
[01:37] <ashika> bignet922: What?
[01:37] <ashika> bingnet922: What?
[01:37] <sethk> bingnet922, no, it renamed it to file.txt
[01:37] <sethk> bingnet922, in whatever was the current directory at the time
[01:38] <bingnet922> OK, I see it. It was renamed and moved to pwd.
[01:38] <noobie0057> jrib: thanks, the resulting url is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32635/ this is the hosts file
[01:38] <bingnet922> What I want to do is mv or cp to same path as source without re-entering the path
[01:38] <bingnet922> Is there an operator for that?
[01:39] <jrib> bingnet922: easiest way would be to just 'cd /some/path' then just do 'mv foo bar'
[01:39] <steffl> you can cd to the directory
[01:39] <noobie0057> jrib: the hostname file is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32636/
[01:39] <eduhat> i dont have the make, or gmake command, how can i add those using aptitude?
[01:39] <bingnet922> How can I rename or copy a file in another directory without entering the path twice and without cd'ing to the other dir?
[01:39] <ashika> eduhat: Why dont you use synaptec.
[01:40] <bingnet922> Is there an operator like ~ or . for that?
[01:40] <eduhat> ashika: i dont know, i like aptitude, plus im not on gnome
[01:40] <sethk> bingnet922, you can always use the full path for any argument.  you never have to cd for _any_ command.
[01:41] <sethk> bingnet922, if you give a directory name as the target (the last argument), cp will create a file with the same name
[01:41] <sethk> bingnet922, so cp /x/abc.def /y   will create /y/abc.def, if y is a directory
[01:41] <ashika> eduhat: Did you try aptitude make?
[01:41] <jrib> noobie0057: you want to make sure you have this in your /etc/hosts:   127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost zdux0012-desktop
[01:41] <justin_> Is there a program I can use to shrink an iso file with linux?
[01:41] <sethk> bingnet922, to copy it to the current directory, you can say:   cp /x/abc.def .
[01:41] <ashika> eduhat: Thats make's package name
[01:41] <sethk> bingnet922, which creates ./abc.def
[01:41] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, can i print the info i need via dos? i can still boot windows
[01:42] <eduhat> ashika: thx
[01:42] <ashika> eduhat: Did it work? And what else did you need
[01:42] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, I doubt it, but I'm not a windows expert.  If your mbr is clobbered, windows won't be able to see it any more than linux can
[01:42] <ashika> eduhat: be sure yo have makedepend and makedev they are required by make. I dont know if aptitude gets them for you
[01:43] <seanieb64> Can anyone tell e how to upgrade Perl on Ubuntu without deleting everything along with Perl?
[01:43] <jrib> noobie0057: did you ever create a root password?
[01:43] <seanieb64> basically the kubuntu-desktop and all it's dependencies.
[01:43] <ashika> jrib: Isn't root autogenerated?
[01:43] <jrib> ashika: I have no idea what that means :)
[01:43] <bingnet922> sethk: I'm with you. Except for "you can always use the full path for any argument.  you never have to cd for _any_ command."
[01:44] <ashika> jrib: As in ubuntu automatically makes a random root password and all you do is change it in System > Administration > Groups and users
[01:44] <sethk> bingnet922, right.  what's the problem with that?
[01:44] <noobie0057> jrib: yes I have a root password,, well it's the same as my users password,, I don't think it could have been compromised,, it's like 15 characters random ascii
[01:44] <jrib> ashika: no it doesn't make a random one, it's a blank one
[01:44] <Telroth_Plushie|> ashika, no
[01:44] <LjL> ashika: it's not a random password. it's a locked account.
[01:44] <bingnet922> sethk: What do you mean by "you can always use the full path for any argument.  you never have to cd for _any_ command."
[01:44] <Telroth_Plushie|> ashika, root is actually disabled/locked
[01:44] <ashika> jrib: For me it was automatically filled in and all I did was change it.
[01:45] <sethk> ashika, if it's the password from the desktop install, it's set to a special value that prevents root login
[01:45] <ashika> Telroth_Plushie|: Not for me. I went to users and groups and it was already there.
[01:45] <sethk> Telroth_Plushie|, root is not disbled/locked.  _login_ for root is disabled.
[01:45] <jrib> noobie0057: well I ask because you won't be able to use sudo to edit the file.  So su to root and edit it that way  (otherwise you'd have to reboot, etc...)
[01:45] <Telroth_Plushie|> ashika, that's a mask
[01:45] <Riyo> You can make a wireless card, in ubuntu, do double-duty, as in adhoch and infrastrucutre at the same time?
[01:45] <Intelligitimate> Is there a program to shrink an ISO?
[01:45] <sethk> ashika, root is there.  the system cannot run without a root account
[01:45] <Telroth_Plushie|> so someone can't see how long the password is
[01:45] <ashika> Telroth_Plushie|: Mask? What do you mean. Root is there and when I changed that sudo changed aswell
[01:45] <noobie0057> jrib: it looks like I'm missing a new line character or several new line characters. I'm going to clean it up, reboot, then if it works back it up and maybe try updating it again,, thanks for your help!!
[01:45] <sethk> ashika, if you do    man passwd       you'll see how a password is created to prevent login
[01:46] <jrib> noobie0057: shouldn't need to reboot (I think)
[01:46] <sethk> ashika, the root account in ubuntu is precisely the same as the root account in any other linux distro
=== SurfnKid_ is now known as SurfnKid
[01:46] <ashika> sethk: I know I mean't it generated a password by itself so no one can login untill you change it
[01:46] <Lahey> ok so you wouldnt waist your money on 3 celerone @ 3.2ghz each with an OM setup?
[01:46] <sethk> ashika, correct
[01:46] <Telroth_Plushie|> ashika, what i mean is if you give root a 1 character long password, it will look like a 6 char password, as will a 32-char password
[01:46] <seanieb64> Anyone here know what I can do with my need to upgrade Perl?
=== fee is now known as [fe3] 
[01:46] <ashika> sethk: Thats what I was saying.
[01:46] <sethk> ashika, ok
[01:46] <ashika> Telroth_Plushie|: But its randomnly generated is it not?
[01:46] <ashika> Telroth_Plushie|: When you install.
[01:46] <LjL> no
[01:46] <sethk> ashika, no.
[01:46] <Telroth_Plushie|> ashika, it doesn't generate a password
[01:47] <Riyo> Or is that impossible?
[01:47] <ashika> Telroth_Plushie|: So its blank but appears to be generated. Ah I see thanks.
[01:47] <sethk> ashika, as I already told you,          man passwd          will tell you about how it is created.
[01:47] <Telroth_Plushie|> there literally is no password
[01:47] <varsendaggr> Hey what is up guys?
[01:47] <sethk> ashika, no, it is not blank
[01:47] <Telroth_Plushie|> you can't log into an account with no password
[01:47] <sethk> ashika, it is a _special_ value that is known to never result from any password
[01:47] <wikityler> does anyone here use gpilot ?
[01:47] <ashika> sethk: What do you mean?
=== Daylighter_ is now known as Daylighter
[01:48] <bang> hey has anyone had a problem with ntfs-fuse?
[01:48] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, so i need to completely re-partition?
[01:48] <LjL> bang: yes, many people probably have
[01:48] <sethk> ashika, it is set with    passwd -l            if you run the command              man passwd            it will tell you how that works
[01:48] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, you need to rewrite the mbr.  with the correct data for the partitions that already exist.
[01:48] <bang> LjL, i followed website instrutions but it wont let me mount it
[01:49] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, which is quite different.  you want to save all the data on your partitions.  borking the mbr doesn't actually touch the data
[01:49] <Doow> sethk: you use a lot of whitespace =)
[01:49] <sethk> Doow        I              do         ?
[01:49] <SurfnKid> Got a PC Id like with Ubuntu
[01:49] <Doow> sethk: any special reason?
[01:49] <asdfasdfdd> i dont have the data, is there a utility to do it?
[01:49] <Doow> sethk: yes =P
=== existance_ is now known as jtann
[01:49] <sethk> Doow, I was setting off the part of what I was typing that's a literal command
[01:49] <ashika> sethk: Yes I just typed that in terminal so what does the - l option do?
[01:49] <seanieb64> Anyone know about how to upgrade perl?
[01:49] <bang> is there a way to convert the hdd to vfat? if its a ntfs? besides a format?
[01:49] <SurfnKid> however its got a CD-ROM,  how can I install the needed files and then pull the rest of the 3.2gb from another local network source instead?
[01:49] <seanieb64> I'm installing it from a deb.
[01:49] <CountDown> I'm running Dapper and would like to upgrade to Edgy... what's the suggested way of doing this?  apt-get dist-upgrade, or fresh install?
[01:49] <Doow> sethk: ok
[01:50] <sethk> ashika, "man passwd" is a command that tells you what all the passwd options do.
[01:50] <varsendaggr> CountDown, do not do dist-upgrade
[01:50] <SurfnKid> mmm
[01:50] <seanieb64> if I try to yuse apt-get it tries to uninstall kubuntu-desktop.
[01:50] <sethk> ashika, I couldn't possibly type in a better explanation than the one you already have, just waiting for you to read it.   in man passwd, you can do   /-l   to find dash l so you don't have to read all of it.
[01:50] <CountDown> varsendaggr: I read the man page on it and it didn't seem like it would do the trick.
[01:50] <SurfnKid> could i set a network share and then in Synaptic Manager add the CD ROM source from the network?
[01:50] <SurfnKid> i guess ill try that
[01:50] <kitche> ashika: passwd -l locks account
[01:50] <varsendaggr> CountDown, go to the ubuntu.com website and it has a script to run i think
[01:50] <ashika> sethk: I did that but it didn't explain what each option did other than -l and 5 more things equal to login.
[01:51] <noobie0057> jrib: your right, I cannot edit the file,, su root tells me Authentication failure
[01:51] <varsendaggr> CountDown, i will go to the site and help you with that
[01:51] <Silmethule> why don't do dist-upgrade?
[01:51] <sethk> ashika, -l is what you were asking about.  it tells you what -l does.  so what's missing?
[01:51] <ashika> sethk: Sorry just found it.
[01:51] <sethk> ashika, I checked before I told you to run it.  :)
[01:51] <ashika> sethk: Smart :)
[01:51] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, is there a utility to scan the partition info and rebuild the mbr?
[01:52] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, there are some programs of that sort around.  not in the distro, you'll have to download.
[01:52] <ashika> sethk: you know in gnome does the seperator count in the countdown for default OS to boot? So would I count Other Operating Systems as something because it can be highlighted with down key?
[01:52] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, I use my own, which aren't really usable for non-hackers.  but google will show you lots of them
[01:52] <ashika> sethk: Sorry I meant grub not gnome
[01:53] <CountDown> varsendaggr: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/releasenotes/610?highlight=%28dist-upgrade%29
[01:53] <jrib> noobie0057: ok reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then use 'nano -w /etc/hosts' to edit the file.  It is pretty straight forward.  ctrl-o saves, ctrl-x exits.  Alternatively, you can copy the file somewhere in your HOME, edit it with your favorite editor now, and then just overwrite your old one with the edited copy in your HOME once you are in recovery mode
[01:53] <sethk> ashika, there is a parameter to set how many seconds before booting the default.  hold on, I'll get the name
[01:53] <Dante123> I have Dell Optiplex 192 MB RAM, 350 MHZ Pentium II processor......and an HP Pavilion 533 AMD K2 Processor with 256 MB ram.....both have 5 gig drives.....any recommendations on a linux distro for these older machines????
[01:53] <jrib> noobie0057: I have to reboot now as well, any questions before I go?
[01:53] <Silmethule> why "do not do dist-upgrade"?
[01:53] <Riyo> Can somebody tell me how to go about getting my PCI wireless card to work in Ubuntu? Im currently in Windows
[01:53] <LjL> !info testdisk | doesn't rebuild the "MBR", i think, but it does claim to try and rebuild the partition table

[01:53] <sethk> ashika, timeout.  as in, on a separate line,  "timeout 30"
[01:53] <asdfasdfdd> any .exe binaries that i can run via windows? (since i can only run live ubuntu)
[01:53] <ashika> sethk: I know that but does the Other Operating Systems seperator count as a OS when selecting from 0-3 which one to boot.
[01:54] <varsendaggr> CountDown, Yeah that was the one i used
[01:54] <ashika> sethk: I was asking whther to count Other Operating Systems as a OS for which one is default os.
[01:54] <sethk> ashika, everything with a title line in menu.lst counts
[01:54] <ashika> sethk: Thanks
[01:54] <sethk> ashika, put your menu.lst file on the paste site, if you need more specific help.
[01:54] <CountDown> varsendaggr: Thanks.
[01:54] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, could you point me to an exe utility for windows?
[01:54] <[fe3] > hi, I am trying to set the native screen resolution of my HDTV in ubuntu to 1366x768.. with ATI radeon 9800SE, however I cannot seem to be able to do this.  Google search has revealed many people with similar problem.. does edgy eft intend to support native HDTV resolutions?
[01:54] <bang> anyone know some commands or strings for ntfs-fuse?
[01:54] <SurfnKid> How well does Ubuntu perform on a Hyperthreading Intel chip?
[01:55] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, I don't know, sorry.  google should help you.  or a windows channel on IRC.  or someone else here.

[01:55] <finsta> Hey guys, got a question here. I got a laptop which I cannot afford to reformat. The OS needs to stay on there and when resizing it dies and I gotta load up a Ghost image
[01:55] <sethk> ashika, ok
[01:55] <varsendaggr> CountDown, i used that one       ----->   gksu "update-manager -c"
[01:55] <asdfasdfdd> methinks
[01:55] <finsta> What do you guys suggest?
[01:55] <varsendaggr> CountDown, wait
[01:55] <LjL> !fuse | bang
[01:55] <ubotu> bang: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[01:55] <finsta> It's an IBM T42
[01:55] <sethk> SurfnKid, that's too vague to answer.
[01:55] <SurfnKid> sethk, well windows xp is just too slow
[01:55] <ashika> sethk: So you said seperator counts correct?
[01:55] <[fe3] > does anyone use a 16:9 resolution here? is it even possible?
[01:55] <SurfnKid> but oh well ill have to wait
[01:55] <varsendaggr> CountDown, i first did the apt-get dist-upgrade and it killed my system
[01:55] <SurfnKid> till i try it
[01:56] <sethk> ashika, I don't think that it does, no, but I have to double check to be certain.
[01:56] <CountDown> varsendaggr: Um, too late.
[01:56] <steveb> hello. dont suppose anyone can tell me where i can get the 2.6.17-10 kernel sources? the apt package is 2.6.10-13 for some reason
[01:56] <rothgar> I am having some problems with a 6.10 server install
[01:56] <varsendaggr> too late what?
[01:56] <CountDown> varsendaggr: I'm going with update-manager.  It's running now.
[01:56] <finsta> fe3, edit your config for that
[01:56] <sethk> SurfnKid, if you use GUI programs on it you won't find it significantly faster or slower than windows
[01:56] <CountDown> :)
[01:56] <varsendaggr> cool that is the way to do it
[01:56] <varsendaggr> yeah
[01:56] <ashika> sethk: Is it possible to check or do I have to do trial and error?
[01:56] <varsendaggr> YAY!!

[01:56] <tin_nqn> hello
[01:56] <sethk> ashika, I can check the code, but it will take a few minutes.  might be quicker to just try it.
[01:56] <finsta> Anybody?
[01:57] <wasp_ems> hello i have installed xgl and beryl on xubuntu.when i login xgl and i try to load beryl i get the following error can anyone help?waspius@KiLlEr313:~$ sudo killall xfwm4 && beryl-manager

[01:57] <ashika> the seperator says Other Operating Systems and it can be highlighted but pressing enter just flickers the screen
[01:57] <wasp_ems> sorry
[01:57] <tin_nqn> how can I do an infinite loop of number in bash ?
[01:57] <SurfnKid> sethk, but the virus, popup, spyware issue will get fixed which is about 50% of the problem, and itll be great to administer via CLI
[01:57] <sethk> rothgar, start by checking your default route
[01:57] <Sobko> How to remove old kernel
[01:57] <halex-ab> tin_nqn, perform an expression where true == true?
[01:58] <halex-ab> And increment the number?
[01:58] <rothgar> sethk: how do I check that? :(
[01:58] <gustavold> does the ubuntu clean the /tmp folder regularly?
[01:58] <Telroth_Plushie|> wasp_ems, what's you're depth?
[01:58] <Sobko> just delete or what
[01:58] <Telroth_Plushie|> *your
[01:58] <tin_nqn> yes, incrementing the number
[01:58] <sethk> SurfnKid, you asked about performance, so I answered you.  Obviously I'm a linux user.
[01:58] <asdfasdfdd> brb apparently there is an option on fdisk in cmd that fixes the mbr, ill tell you how it goes sethk
[01:58] <LjL> steveb: well, the ubuntu kernel packages get patched. kernel.org if you want a fresh kernel tarball
[01:58] <finsta> Hey guys, got a question here. I got a laptop which I cannot afford to reformat. The OS needs to stay on there and when resizing it dies and I gotta load up a Ghost image. It's an IBM T42...Anybody?
[01:58] <Telroth_Plushie|> if you're running 24-bit color, you'll need to drop it to 16
[01:58] <kitche> waso_ems: just start beryl-manager that'sa ll I had to do
[01:58] <wasp_ems> Telroth_Plushie|, 24
[01:58] <sethk> rothgar, at a console prompt, type in route (with no arguments) which will show you the current routing table
=== name_ is now known as name
[01:58] <sethk> finsta, what are you using to shrink the partition?
[01:58] <SurfnKid> sethk, ok if i run into issues ill holler :)
[01:59] <Telroth_Plushie|> wasp_ems, change it to 16 bit; beryl only plays nice with powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...)
[01:59] <steveb> LjL: oh i know. the linux-kernal package is 2.6.17-10 though, and the linux-source is 2.6.17-13! they dont match up!
[01:59] <wasp_ems> Telroth_Plushie|, will it load in that case?is that the problem?
[01:59] <Skwid_> wow
[01:59] <finsta> Sethk, I've used Acronis and PartitionMagic
[01:59] <Skwid_> i just upgraded to edgy
[01:59] <Telroth_Plushie|> wasp_ems, i'm pretty sure
[01:59] <steveb> LjL: i think someone must have put the wrong tar in for the source package because it is named as 2.6.17-10
[01:59] <Telroth_Plushie|> that's the problem i had
[01:59] <finsta> It dies on resizing
[01:59] <sethk> finsta, and both fail?  that's odd.
[01:59] <Telroth_Plushie|> if it's not, come back
[02:00] <Skwid_> and it seems that im running xgl + compiz now, even without chosing it when logging in !
[02:00] <finsta> Yeah
[02:00] <Skwid_> isn't that odd ?
[02:00] <finsta> Yet the HD is fine
[02:00] <LjL> steveb, the version of the *package* is 1.6.17-10. if then version.h or whatever says otherwise, my guess is that it's because of patches from the Ubuntu team, which should then also exist in the binary version
[02:00] <finsta> No errors on HD tests
[02:00] <finsta> And it works fine otherwise
[02:00] <rothgar> sethk: what should it look like? I see my router as the default gateway, but that is about all I recognize
[02:00] <sethk> finsta, if you were resizing linux it would be easy, because you could back up and then restore the files.
[02:00] <tin_nqn> halex-ab: can you help me?
[02:00] <sethk> finsta, but that won't work with a bootable xp partition.
[02:00] <Doow> Skwid_: hehe, yeah
[02:00] <sethk> rothgar, that's all you need to see.
[02:00] <finsta> Just dies out and kills the WinXP install
[02:00] <steveb> LjL: yes... they dont. uname -a gives 2.6.17-10
[02:00] <LjL> steveb, could be, but i doubt it. i think it's just 2.6.17-10 *with some stuff backported from -13*. admittedly though i don't really know
[02:00] <sethk> rothgar, can you ping the router?
[02:00] <halex-ab> tin_nqn, I'm not really a BASH expert..
[02:01] <Skwid_> Doow: why is that ?
[02:01] <sethk> finsta, wait, now I'm confused.  what winxp install?
[02:01] <rothgar> sethk: nope
[02:01] <seanieb64> ...
[02:01] <bang> cheers peoples i had group=ntfs changed to gid=1001 ;) fixed problem
[02:01] <Doow> Skwid_: I have no idea, but I agree that it's odd
[02:01] <bang> cheers ;)
[02:01] <Skwid_> :)
[02:01] <LjL> steveb, if you're sure about that, then it's worth filing a bug
[02:01] <Skwid_> Doow: any way to check which one i am actually running ?
[02:01] <finsta> I'm resizing a WinXP install...I asked some people and was suggested to go here. I can't resize my NTFS partition and it dies
[02:01] <sethk> rothgar, hmm.  your cable is good because you can ssh from another box on the lan, you said, right?
[02:01] <wasp_ems> Telroth_Plushie|, thanx..is there any chance u know how to change it?do i just write in a terminal depth=16?
[02:01] <tim167> does Rosegarden 1.4 work on Ubuntu ? (it says to build it i need KDE3.1+, but i don't find that in synaptic)
[02:01] <noobie0057> Hi I'm having trouble using sudo or su I have a corrupted hosts file and su returns su: Authentication failure
[02:01] <Telroth_Plushie|> Skwid_, ps aux | grep compix
[02:01] <Doow> Skwid_: probably, but I don't know almost anything about it
[02:02] <sethk> finsta, don't try to resize and install all in one thing
[02:02] <lifepositive> sethk: hi :)
[02:02] <sethk> finsta, resize first, separately.
[02:02] <finsta> Yeah
[02:02] <bingnet922> Hi room, how do I change themes in KDE? Thanks for your help!
[02:02] <sethk> lifepositive, hello
[02:02] <rothgar> sethk: I am using putty right now.  I can't even ping the computer I am sshing from.
[02:02] <Telroth_Plushie|> if it outputs anything besides "grep compiz" with a few numbers, then you are running compix
[02:02] <steveb> LjL: ok. ill research it a little more and file a bug in the morning
[02:02] <Telroth_Plushie|> *compiz
[02:02] <seanieb64> Anyone know how to help me upgrade perl on my system manually?

[02:02] <DelawareAEA> tim167: i am currently using rosegarden 1.4.  got it from the repositories, didn't build from scratch
[02:02] <finsta> I do, but I can't reinstall Windows. I have to load up a ghost image
[02:02] <finsta> Since it's a client
[02:02] <Telroth_Plushie|> Skwid_, you aren't using compiz then
[02:02] <Skwid_> Telroth_Plushie|: it seems not
[02:02] <Skwid_> Telroth_Plushie|: but but !!
[02:02] <finsta> And they can't afford to reformat
[02:02] <Skwid_> there is real transparency
[02:02] <tim167> DelawareAEA: on ubuntu edgy ?
[02:03] <Skwid_> desktop switching is like a 3d cube
[02:03] <wasp_ems> Telroth_Plushie|,  thanx..is there any chance u know how to change it?do i just write in a terminal depth=16?
[02:03] <DelawareAEA> tim167: yup
[02:03] <Doow> Skwid_: could be beryl
[02:03] <Telroth_Plushie|> Skwid_, kde supports real transparency if you have composite enabled
[02:03] <Skwid_> Doow: is that what comes configured with edgy ?
[02:03] <tim167> DelawareAEA: how come its not in synaptic here ?
[02:03] <Skwid_> no it's gnome
[02:03] <Telroth_Plushie|> wasp_ems, you have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:03] <Telroth_Plushie|> sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[02:03] <ekimus> hello, I'm planning a xen server but it seems that ubuntu doesn't have any domU kernels available, packages.ubuntu.com has 4 xen0 images but no xenU images, intention or accident?
[02:03] <wasp_ems> Telroth_Plushie|, thanx
[02:04] <Doow> Skwid_: beryl is a fork of compiz (or maybe the project changed name, I'm not 100% sure)
[02:04] <Telroth_Plushie|> be careful though, if you mess it up it won't load the gui and all you'll have is a command line
[02:04] <ekimus> s/ubuntu/ubuntu edgy
[02:04] <finsta> sethk, any ideas?
[02:04] <steffl> Doow: it`s a fork
[02:04] <dcordes_> how can i browse the fs on a remote box with nautilus?
[02:04] <Skwid_> i love this ! but it's really awkward
[02:04] <noobie0057> hi I'm getting Authentication failure when I try the command su
[02:04] <tin_nqn> halex-ab: thanks anyway
[02:04] <tim167> DelawareAEA: and does it work well with audio files (wav, aiff and the like...)
[02:04] <varsendaggr> will someone explain the use of tomboy to me?
[02:04] <finsta> Note taking
[02:04] <kitche> Doow: beryl is a fork of compiz no gnome dependencies
[02:05] <Skwid_> what am i running then ?
[02:05] <DelawareAEA> tim167:  have you enabled all of the repositories?  default is just "main"  try "universe" "multiverse"
[02:05] <Skwid_> :)
[02:05] <steffl> varsendaggr: it`s for notes

[02:05] <ekimus> noobie0057:

[02:05] <tim167> DelawareAEA: yes they are all enabled
[02:06] <rothgar> I guess I will try installing again, thanks for your help sethk
[02:06] <ekimus> noobie0057:  is that a question?
[02:06] <tim167> DelawareAEA: i see rosegarden4, but that is version 1.2.4, right
[02:06] <Rookie_> Thats funny - sudo= superuser ? i belive its sudo = Switch User and DO
[02:07] <DelawareAEA> tim167:  yes, my apologies for not paying attn
[02:07] <tim167> DelawareAEA: np
[02:07] <halex-ab> Rookie_, if you run sudo -i -H, you get superuser..
[02:07] <noobie0057> ekimus: sorry no,,, my hosts file is corrupted. using sudo at all gives me a error message sudo: unable to lookup <computer name> via gethostbyname()
[02:07] <Skwid_> anybody have a clue where my transparent windows and 3d desktop switching could come from if it's not compiz ?
[02:08] <finsta> Anybody?
[02:08] <steffl> Skwid_: don`t you know what you have changed?
[02:08] <Rookie_> su means Switch User, i.e - su -username will switch to that user if its doen by root, it wont give the user rootpriviliges
[02:08] <seanieb64> Anyone know how to upgrade Perl? Please, The guy on #perl that will respond is a jerk.
[02:08] <tim167> DelawareAEA: btw, the new version of Rosegarden seems to have lots of new feats :p
[02:08] <Skwid_> steffl: i just upgraded to edgy
[02:08] <noobie0057> su root, has the same effect,,
[02:08] <Skwid_> steffl: unless it's all just gnome 2.16 features ...
[02:08] <ekimus> noobie0057:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32639/ <- that should help (not exactly an ubuntu but the important things should be readable from it :)
[02:09] <Rookie_> root is even above God ;)
[02:09] <LjL> noobie0057, have you changed your hostname?
[02:09] <halex-ab> Damn straight!
[02:09] <steffl> Skwid_: it won`t come with the default installation
[02:09] <sethk> noobie0057, you are running into one of the problems with ubuntu's setup.  you have to boot the live cd to get around it.
[02:09] <steffl> Skwid_: so must have had s.th. like compiz installed before
[02:10] <noobie0057> LjL: no,, I installed ruby a while ago,, I don't know when the problem first occured
[02:10] <eduhat> how can i get the sources for ubuntu kernal, i need them to install wlan0 driver for my wifi card
[02:10] <Skwid_> steffl: yeah, i had compiz installed before
[02:10] <sethk> eduhat, there is a package for them.  search for "linux" in synaptic.
[02:10] <Skwid_> steffl: but before, i had to log into gdm with the XGL option
[02:10] <noobie0057> sethk: do you know what I should do? boot on the cd then edit the hosts file?
[02:10] <Skwid_> now, im regularly logged in ...
[02:10] <sethk> noobie0057, yes
=== Renan_s2 is now known as RenanBirck
[02:11] <sethk> eduhat, the exact name depends on the version you are running.
[02:11] <eduhat> sethk: allright, well im running 6.06 LTS
[02:11] <noobie0057> sethk: I'm a newbie,, how do I access the correct hosts file,, I think if I tried I might not know how to mount the harddrive
=== RenanBirck is now known as Renan_s2
[02:12] <Rookie_> noobie0057 - under /etc
[02:12] <sethk> noobie0057, that depends on your partition layout and such.  do you know which partition is your linux root file system?
[02:12] <eduhat> sethk: what would be the kernal for ubuntu 6.06LTS?
[02:12] <wasp_ems> how can i check what my depth is?
[02:12] <steffl> Skwid_: then it will be still compiz
[02:12] <noobie0057> sethk: I just have a swap and then everything else
[02:13] <effie_jayx> eduhat try uname -r
[02:13] <steffl> Skwid_: you just don`t need the XGL option anymore, I guess
[02:13] <sethk> eduhat, uname -r will show your kernel revision.  then it is:   kernel-source-2.6.whatever.  I'm not running the same version which is why I'm not filling in the whatever part
[02:13] <ashika> K
[02:13] <eduhat> sethk: 2.6.15-23-386
[02:13] <ashika> Someone tell me howto run .bin files without getting permission denied from console
[02:13] <halex-ab> ashika, chmod +x filename.bin
[02:13] <Skwid_> steffl: that's weird ... cause i have no 'compix' process running
[02:13] <sethk> noobie0057, and the entire drive is linux?  probably you'll need to mount /dev/hda1.   you can do this:   fdisk -l /dev/hda   which will list the partitions on hda
[02:13] <halex-ab> then try to run it
[02:14] <sethk> noobie0057, hda assumes that you are using IDE drives and the partitions are on primary master.
[02:14] <effie_jayx> ashika: permission denied?
[02:14] <effie_jayx> ashika: sudo?
[02:14] <effie_jayx> ashika: ./filename ...
[02:14] <halex-ab> effie_jayx, you have to make it executable first..
[02:14] <sethk> eduhat, just run synaptic, use search, and type in kernel-source
[02:14] <jessid> hello friends, it is me again with te topic: how can I connect my palm in ubuntu? I havent been able to make it work
[02:14] <sethk> eduhat, you'll get a list of available kernel source packages.
[02:14] <effie_jayx> halex-ab,  true
[02:15] <noobie0057> sethk: yes primary master,, I think that is how I set it up,, maybe I  should just try it?
[02:15] <sethk> noobie0057, sure, why not?
[02:15] <eduhat> sethk: well i dont use synaptic, because right now im not in gnome, so how could i do it through aptitude or how can i start syntaptic through fluxbox?
[02:15] <sethk> noobie0057, if fdisk -l /dev/hda doesn't do what you expect, then you'll know it isn't ide primary master.  :)
[02:15] <sethk> eduhat, sure, just bring up a console and type in    sudo synaptic
[02:15] <dougsko> anyone know how to install some new fonts? here's what ive done so far: i put the ttf's in /usr/share/X11/fonts/newfonts. then i ran "fc-cache -fv ./". after that i added the directory to the fontpath section of xorg.conf. restarted X, but they still dont show
[02:15] <Skwid_> hum, anybody know if i can create a symlink from my windows firefox profile on a FAT32 partition to my ubuntu firefox profile ?

[02:16] <steffl> dougsko: I think you need to update the font-cache
[02:16] <Malachi> Any ideas?
[02:17] <dougsko> steffl: well that was the point of fc-cache, i think
[02:17] <landexem> So I have a MacBook Pro with x86 Edgy on it and at ATI X1600 video card.  Can I not run Beryl because of the limitations of ATI's binary drivers?
[02:17] <rothgar> is there a argument to set up ubuntu without any extra programs (no office, firefox, etc)

[02:18] <sethk> Skwid_, FAT doesn't have permissions.  you can change the apparent owner of the files using mount options

[02:21] <sethk> SurfnKid, if the BIOS supports booting from the external drive, yes.
[02:21] <dope12345> jesus getting the dial up modem setup is more complicated than wireless

[02:23] <eduhat> can someone please help me get my wireless card working with ubuntu without ndiswrapper?
[02:23] <smallfoot-> I hope someone can add computer hardware manufacturers who are Linux/FOSS/competition/etc friendly or unfriendly to http://vendors.bluwiki.org/
[02:23] <varsendaggr> Skwid_, what does your fstab look like
[02:23] <sethk> dope12345, lot's of stuff does.  the answer really is that when you increase flexibility you also increase the difficulty.
[02:23] <LjL> dope12345: because "winmodems" are so called because they are mostly just a DSP chip and an interface to the phoneline, and all the rest is done by proprietary and sometimes patented Windows software, and the interfaces are not disclosed. that's why.
[02:23] <SurfnKid> sweet it does, would i have to format the hdd with the iso on it, or just dump it on the main root?
[02:23] <dope12345> ugh i can't get any internet going to this thing that isn't an ethernet cable
[02:23] <loca|host> what's the minimal disk space to a minimal ubuntu install ?
[02:23] <varsendaggr> dope12345, probably not
[02:23] <Cosmonaut3030> Hello, can someone tell me how to update Perl?
[02:24] <sethk> SurfnKid, you can't really put an iso onto a hard drive.
[02:24] <SurfnKid> sethk, i mean the contents
[02:24] <sethk> Cosmonaut3030, there are several different packages that comprise perl
[02:24] <Cosmonaut3030> Are they the libraries?
[02:24] <dope12345> i installed the bcm4306 firmware using bcm43xx-fwcutter. how do i connect to an AP?
[02:24] <Seveas> Cosmonaut3030, why would you want that?
[02:24] <sethk> SurfnKid, I think putting the files on is probably better than copying the iso file to it.  it will take a lot longer, though
[02:25] <mark__> cosmonaut, what version of perl do you have now?
[02:25] <dope12345> i can't get the network manager to install because of some dependencies so is there some command line stuff i have to do?
[02:25] <eduhat> does the wlan0 drivers come with ubuntu, if not how can i get them?
[02:25] <Cosmonaut3030> cosmonaut@benvolio:~$ perl -v
[02:25] <Cosmonaut3030> This is perl, v5.8.8 built for i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi
[02:25] <SurfnKid> worth a try then..
[02:25] <sethk> dope12345, the package manager should install whatever is missing.  tell us exactly what you are seeing.
[02:25] <Cosmonaut3030> 5.8.8, and i want 5.8.8.1
[02:25] <Seveas> Cosmonaut3030, why?
[02:25] <Abst> Is there anything like Airport for a Mac where it sits in my panel and shows signal strength, etc?
[02:25] <dope12345> i can't connect to the internet so i have to d/l the packages in windows and then install them in linux
[02:26] <mark__> eduhat, apt-get will resolve dependencies. sudo apt-get install network-manager should do it
[02:26] <dope12345> i'm out of town and only have access to wireless
[02:26] <Cosmonaut3030> I want to play Frozen Bubble2
[02:26] <Seveas> installing a non-packagd version of perl is an enourmous risk
[02:26] <barata> hallo, anybody uses Acomdata 320GB and have troubles?
[02:26] <Seveas> Cosmonaut3030, DO NOT USE PACKAGES FROM DEBIAN ON UBUNTU
[02:26] <Cosmonaut3030> Why?
[02:26] <barata> hallo, anybody uses Acomdata 320GB external and have troubles?
[02:26] <Seveas> because then you break stuff like this
[02:26] <eduhat> mark__: allright, thank you
[02:26] <Seveas> debian isn't ubuntu. Don't use debian packages on ubuntu or you WILL break your system
[02:26] <dope12345> so what's the command line stuff to connect with wireless
[02:27] <dope12345> i know the the name of the AP i want to connect to and it's open
[02:27] <JoshJ> isn't debian supposedly binary compatible with ubuntu?
[02:27] <Seveas> JoshJ, no
[02:27] <Abst> Cosmonaut3030, Trust him, I added debian repos and bricked my machine
[02:27] <JoshJ> hrm
[02:27] <Cosmonaut3030> I haven't used any debian debs yet... I've tryed building from source, but i get an error. Shall I show it here?
[02:27] <Seveas> JoshJ, only source compatible
[02:27] <JoshJ> did it used to be?
[02:27] <mark__> it won't definetly break ubuntu
[02:27] <Seveas> Cosmonaut3030, no, read a compiling faq instead
[02:27] <eduhat> mark__: right now my card is show with the interface of eth1, but on the website it says the driver should be wlan0, i know that that is also the interface name, how would i get my card to be recognized by the wlan0 driver?
[02:27] <Seveas> !compiling > Cosmonaut3030
[02:27] <Sobko> heyaaa
[02:27] <Cosmonaut3030> !compiling?
[02:27] <JoshJ> (also isn't everything linux-based source compatible?)
[02:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about compiling? - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:27] <Cosmonaut3030> I've read the install file, if that means anything?
[02:27] <sethk> JoshJ, debian and ubuntu are both available for a variety of architectures.  so the statement "debian is binary compatible with ubuntu" makes no sense at all
[02:27] <wasabi_> JoshJ: Totally not.
[02:27] <LjL> Cosmonaut3030: look at your private messages

[02:28] <Seveas> antoniod, check the md5sum of iso and cd
[02:28] <Cosmonaut3030> Thanks, i'll check that link.
[02:28] <effie_jayx> LOL
[02:28] <Intelligitimate> Is there a program to shrink an ISO?
[02:28] <sethk> antoniod, bad download?  bad burn?
[02:28] <effie_jayx> my wife likes it
[02:28] <steffl> antoniod: burn slower, might help
[02:28] <sethk> Intelligitimate, you can compress any file, including an iso file.
[02:29] <effie_jayx> but she just can't see that all the software she uses on the other side has an equivalent here or better
[02:29] <sethk> Intelligitimate, I'm not sure if that's what you are really asking though.  you can, for example, do this:    bzip2 filename.iso
[02:29] <Intelligitimate> I need to compress the iso so it will fit on a DVD and play.
[02:29] <eduhat> mark__: well my wireless card is eth1 and wired is eth0, but the wireless should be wlan0... im connected through wired right now
[02:29] <wikityler> Skwid_: see your PMs

[02:38] <Seveas> you tried to use the cursor keys or something
[02:38] <Daylighter> could it be a bad signal or bad batteries?

[02:42] <Daylighter> now my terminal is filling up with ^[[2~^[[2~^[[2~^[[2~^[[2~^[[2~^[[2~
[02:42] <barata> it is an Acomdata with pushbutton sh1t,
[02:42] <GeForce> ljl: is it possible it didn't switch?
[02:42] <kapputu> where can I get help with my problem?
[02:42] <LjL> well actually no, it's all a mess. GeForce, find all instances of "dapper" and change them to "edgy", for starters
[02:42] <green_earz> kalikiana: you cat use the cat command , the syntex is some like, cd to the dir where the files are and ls | cat >> file.mpg
[02:42] <LjL> GeForce: apparently it didn't fully
[02:43] <green_earz> kalikiana: sorry you can not cat
[02:43] <LjL> GeForce, basically you're using dapper's universe
[02:43] <sethk> green_earz, ls > file.mpg
[02:43] <mark__> dapper to edgy updates have gone horribly
[02:43] <wikijeff> Seveas: or Bad : modifier in $ (/).
[02:43] <GeForce> ljl: Hmmm odd
[02:43] <GeForce> aiite doing the changes
[02:43] <sethk> green_earz, no, but what you said isn't going to do what you think
[02:43] <Seveas> wikijeff, then either use a sane shell or read the csh manpage =) <----
[02:43] <wikijeff> Seveas: ok, thanks
[02:43] <Daylighter> I'm serious Seveas, mark__, when I take the batteries out, it stops
[02:43] <sethk> green_earz, anyway, you would just do    cat * >> whatever, if that's really what you want
[02:44] <Seveas> Daylighter, sony explosive batteries?
[02:44] <tom47> Daylighter sounds like a stuck key
[02:44] <kalikiana> green_earz: nice idea, now is it possible or not? // *confused me*
[02:44] <Daylighter> LOL no, just AAs
[02:44] <mark__> daylighter: do you have your cell phone, or any other wireless devices nearby?
[02:44] <Seveas> then the thing is broken
[02:44] <Daylighter> lol
[02:44] <Super_K> Im in Partition Magic right now, and wish to know what happens if I delete the Linux and Linux Swap partition. Will I just need to fix MBR?
[02:44] <Daylighter> how would I be typing if it was a stuck key
[02:44] <Seveas> Daylighter, black magic
[02:45] <mark__> super_k: you'll just need to repair the MBR, yeah
[02:45] <green_earz> sethk: as i said i was not correct on the syntex  but cat can do the job
[02:45] <Daylighter> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh good advice mark__
[02:45] <Seveas> the control codes that produce [[[^2 are not interpreted by most apploications
[02:45] <Daylighter> I'm a ham radio operator and it never occured to me that my phone might be interfering
[02:45] <sethk> Super_K, if you are going to have to fix the mbr, then don't delete them in the first place
[02:45] <GeForce> ljl: Damn, then that was why, when I was installing some packets, it was asking me to uninstall ubuntu-desktop I was like, WTF!?
[02:45] <Super_K> mark__: do I need the windows disc? Or can I use a usb with a batch file
[02:45] <sethk> Super_K, what are you trying to do?
[02:45] <Super_K> Delete linux totally
[02:45] <Seveas> booo
[02:45] <mark__> you should be using the windows disc. hirens boot disk repairs it as well
[02:45] <sethk> Daylighter, that's because you are so tired of people telling you you are interfering with {everything under the sun} that you tune out the entire idea
[02:45] <Seveas> don't delete linux
[02:45] <Super_K> No, Ill be re-installing it later
[02:45] <LjL> Seveas, Daylighter: couldn't it be some idiotic laptop hardware that uses keycodes as a sort of interrupt?
[02:46] <Seveas> LjL, yes, idiotic keyboard ;)
[02:46] <Super_K> hirens boot disc?
[02:46] <cmweb-admin> Can any one help me make a program run three times when my computer connects to the internet? the device is ppp0
[02:46] <Daylighter> sethk, I dont interfere with everyone... I only have a little five watt handheld
[02:46] <sethk> LjL, could be, sure, but I've not seen that in ages
[02:46] <Daylighter> I'm not one of those with te 1500-watt setup and poorly grounded antenna
[02:46] <sethk> Daylighter, you call yourself a ham and you don't even interfere?  hmm.
[02:46] <green_earz> kalikiana: as sethk  said try cat * >> file.mpg   first cd the where the files are
[02:47] <Super_K> sethk: I must delete linux
[02:47] <Daylighter> I volunteer occasionally
[02:47] <sethk> Super_K, why?  and, if so, what exactly do you think you would be fixing in the mbr?
[02:47] <GeForce> ljl: aiite, seems to be ok now.... it just asked me to update a bunch of packets lol
[02:47] <GeForce> I thought I wasn't getting much update notices lol
[02:47] <GeForce> guess that was why
[02:48] <Super_K> sethk: I just want windows for now, I need those partitions, and I would need to fix mbr because GRUB is installed as master, right?
[02:48] <mark__> super_k, you'll have to most likely run a repair windows from the windows disc, since GRUB will intefere with the MBR
[02:48] <sethk> Super_K, no
[02:48] <sethk> Super_K, well, not as you wrote it
[02:48] <sethk> Super_K, you can install the windows boot loader which will cover up grub.  that will happen automatically if you do a windows install, or you can do it manually
[02:48] <kalikiana> sethk: hm... i got a new file (right size) but video is still the same length :/
[02:49] <Super_K> Well Im not planning on installing Windows, just want grub gone
[02:49] <LjL> GeForce: that's possibly yeah ;)
[02:49] <kalikiana> green_earz: i get a new file with the old length :(
[02:49] <Super_K> therefore Im free to delete linux
[02:49] <sethk> Super_K, but that doesn't really have any interaction with the partitions, other than sharing the same sector
[02:49] <Super_K> But I need the space for windows
[02:49] <sethk> Super_K, you don't have to delete partitions to lose grub
[02:49] <shini`> does anyone here use ardour gtk???
[02:49] <sethk> Super_K, ok, that's a separate issue
=== apallo is now known as apallo19
[02:50] <sethk> Super_K, if you want the space, take the space, but it has no impact on installing the windows boot loader over grub
[02:50] <Super_K> Listen, Im wanting to delte linux because I need the space, has nothing to do with GRUB, its just Im wondering If I do delete linux, Ill need to repair MBR
[02:50] <tech> If I install this: linux-image-generic, will it pick a 686 kernel?
[02:50] <sethk> Super_K, I think what you are asking is, will grub stop working if you delete linux, and the answer is yes, if you have a typical isntallation
[02:50] <Super_K> I know it will
[02:50] <Super_K> I dont care
[02:50] <sethk> Super_K, if by "repair the mbr" you mean install the windows boot loader, then yes.
[02:50] <kalikiana> sethk: Any suggestion on how to join video files?
[02:50] <Super_K> Ok
[02:50] <sethk> Super_K, I know, I'm just clearing up what interacts with what
[02:50] <Super_K> How would I manually make MBR master?
[02:51] <GeForce> LjL: I'm still happy to be running AIGLX.... My desktop is so distinguished.... :)
[02:51] <sethk> kalikiana, you can simply join mpeg files together into a bigger file.
[02:51] <klees> has anyone successfully installed beryl + aiglx with a Radeon 9800 Pro???
[02:51] <tom47> Super_Kquote from a google on unistalling ubuntu If you have your windows setup cd, load it, restart the PC, boot off the CD and start the Recovery console. Here you can use the fixmbr command to commandeer your MBR.
[02:51] <tom47> Fixmbr (microsoft.com)
[02:51] <sethk> kalikiana, you need a tool that understands mpeg files.  I imagine any video editing program can handle that.
[02:51] <wasabi_> klees: Working with my 9700 Pro.
[02:51] <Super_K> oh..duh...I totally forgot
[02:51] <mark__> kalikiana: see cinelerra
[02:51] <protocol1> good fight on pay per view tonight
[02:52] <klees> wasabi_: did u follow a particular guide?
[02:52] <wasabi_> klees: No. It's an R300, it's supposed by the open source drivers.
[02:52] <shini`> you could dual boot linux and windows
[02:52] <shini`> but that's precarious
[02:52] <wasabi_> klees: The 9800, I suspect, probably isn't an R300?
[02:52] <klees> how can i find out?
[02:52] <shini`> I've heard that windows likes to sabotage linux any chance it gets
[02:52] <wasabi_> Google.
[02:52] <wasabi_> shini`: It works fine. Windows doesn't randomlly go rewriting your MBR.
[02:52] <wasabi_> Unless you boot of the windows installer CD.
[02:52] <wasabi_> That does. :)
[02:53] <shini`> not your MBR, but other random things on your hard drive
[02:53] <wasabi_> Such as?
[02:53] <kalikiana> mark__: thx, i'll give that a try :)
[02:53] <wasabi_> Windows can't read Linux partitions, so other than the MBR, there isn't anyhting for it.
[02:53] <shini`> writing random data to random areas of your hard drive
[02:53] <shini`> that's what i've been told
[02:53] <wasabi_> It does not do that.
[02:53] <klees> wasabi_: xorg.cong has it as a R350 NH
[02:53] <wasabi_> klees: Then it's not supported.
[02:53] <Super_K> sethk: can I fix MBR without the disc? Maybe a batch file on a usb of some sort?
[02:54] <klees> wasabi_: i do have drivers installed
[02:54] <klees> fglrx
[02:54] <mark__> super_k: hirens boot cd
[02:54] <wasabi_> Those do not support AIGLX.
[02:54] <wasabi_> And likely never will.
[02:54] <wasabi_> Heh.
[02:54] <Super_K> Ill google that
[02:54] <klees> =(
[02:54] <slavik> Beryl is teh rocks
[02:54] <wasabi_> You can use xgl though.
[02:54] <sethk> Super_K, if you haven't killed linux yet, you can
[02:54] <wasabi_> Which is different from AIGLX.
[02:54] <sethk> Super_K, you can boot window, and then use windows to install the windows boot loader
[02:55] <klees> wasabi_: the xorg-driver-fglrx is not open source??
[02:55] <slavik> XGL sits on top of X while AIGLX is part of X, am I correct?
[02:55] <wasabi_> klees: No. It's ATI's propriatary drive.
[02:55] <klees> ic
[02:55] <sethk> Super_K, if you've already killed linux, you'll need a bootable cd (well, media) of some sort
[02:55] <wasabi_> klees: The "radeon" driver is open source, and has recent support for full acceleration on R300 and below.
[02:55] <wasabi_> But not yet above.
[02:55] <wasabi_> So, with an R300, it "Just Works"
[02:56] <Super_K> I havnt done anything yet, and hirens cd is just a bunch of software
[02:56] <klees> wasabi_: got u
[02:56] <noiesmo> Hey all running Edgy Beryl Aiglx Nvidia I normally set screen to 1152x864 when I run warcraft 3 my screen reverts to 1024x764 is there a way to stop this
[02:56] <wasabi_> Obviously guys are working hard to make it work with yoru card, but ya know, it's closed stuff. It's very hard. ;)
[02:56] <klees> wasabi_: any trustworthy guides for the 9800 card?
[02:56] <wasabi_> I suspect any Xgl guide can do it fo ryou.
[02:57] <Super_K> sethk: these I assume?
[02:57] <Super_K> MBR (Master Boot Record) Tools
[02:57] <axa-axa> I'm using Ubuntu Edgy Eft, but Gnome is a lot slower than Windows XP on my machine. Can someone please tell me is KDE (available version in repository) faster than Gnome?
[02:57] <exeakiel> Is there any way to reset your sudo password?
[02:57] <wasabi_> exeakiel: Your sudo password is your own password.
[02:57] <sethk> Super_K, that looks promising, definitely
[02:57] <wasabi_> exeakiel: So a more proper question would be "Help I changed my password and forgot it!"
[02:58] <exeakiel> Well, I know my pass.
[02:58] <wasabi_> It's the same then.
[02:58] <Daylighter> mark__, it's doing it again

[02:59] <jrib> noobie0057: did "recovery mode" not work?
[02:59] <klees> wasabi_: what does OSS stands for?
[02:59] <wasabi_> klees: open source software
[02:59] <wasabi_> klees: or open source system
[02:59] <wasabi_> klees: or probably 400 other things
[02:59] <klees> ok
[02:59] <klees> lol
[02:59] <wasabi_> klees: open sound system

[03:00] <wd> anybody played with lm sensors?
[03:00] <jrib> noobie0057: you can just select it from the grub menu when the computer is booting up (no cd required)

[03:02] <deadlydeathcone> axa-axa - no, but xfce is. What kind of processor do you have?
[03:02] <imonetchlive> i have re-written the mbr to be sure its right

[03:03] <tom47> wd a little while back i did
[03:03] <Bobby_Easland> just wanted to drop a note and sing the praises for Ubuntu!
[03:03] <axa-axa> deadlydeathcone: I thought that since KDE is written in pure C++ (not C# or something like that) it would run faster.
[03:03] <cirvin> where is the x configuratino file called and where is it located?
[03:03] <tech> Hello. I just did a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy. initramfs-tools somehow wants to generate for an old kernel that is not running nor installed anymore; update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-23-386. It fails to do that because /lib/modules doesn't have modules for that kernel.
[03:04] <Bobby_Easland> wife's Windoze gave a BSOD...tried the live CD and WOW!
[03:04] <imonetchlive> dist-upgrade should not be used to upgrade to etch
[03:04] <jrib> cirvin: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:04] <cirvin> thanks
[03:04] <dooop> anyone can help me with dhcp issues?
[03:04] <dooop> i have the logs
[03:04] <wd> tom47 hey thanks for the answer, i want to use conky and gdesklet, but it's saying i need lm sensors, is diff. to install or activate, in windows (oops curse word) it's just a simple prog. i'm trying to show off my linxu box to unbelievers.
[03:05] <tech> imonetchlive, I upgraded to edgy. And why not?
[03:05] <imonetchlive> dunno, heard some one say it earlier, but check google, there's a guide there
[03:05] <deadlydeathcone> axa-axa: it's worth a shot, but on a Athlon XP-2200 it didn't seem to make such of a difference
[03:06] <tech> Uh, I just want a solution on how to fix initramfs, it is obviously doing something wrong. :)
[03:06] <tom47> wd have only used lm sensors in linux
[03:06] <GeForce> Anyone can explain me why is it that, when I have a sound running, people can't talk to me on TS? Like if my card could only process one sound at a time?
[03:06] <dooop> anyone? please, help me with dhcp  problems :( I've got the logs online
[03:06] <imonetchlive> :/ srry, no clue
[03:06] <wd> tom47, yes i would like to also, what r ur thoughts on lm sensors? is it diff to install for linux?
[03:07] <pianoboy3333> Can anyone help me with a sound juicer error?
[03:07] <kitche> GeForce: because it can only process one sound at a time it has to do with how alsa is set up
[03:07] <kalikiana> GeForce: depending on the sound server and apps it might be wrongly addressed
[03:07] <Super_K> Umm
[03:07] <Super_K> I cant seem to find the latest release of ubuntu in a torrent file

[03:16] <JoshJ> np
[03:16] <valehru_server> umm..why does edgy not mount my IPOD ?  Any help would be appreciated/...
[03:16] <Super_K> One last question, will this be the last installment of ubuntu Ill make now that it has an updater thingie
[03:16] <JoshJ> it's probably possible to make that the default
[03:16] <JoshJ> Super_K: in theory you can upgrade from one version to the next easily
[03:16] <LjL> axa-axa: well the link does mention other possibilities
[03:16] <exeakiel> I just wrote 3 dvds full of steam, but it seems like it is missing pieces
[03:16] <Super_K> just by pressing update right?
[03:16] <deadlydeathcone> I haven't tried installing Kubuntu over Ubuntu, but I have with Xubuntu, and it didn't screw anything up
[03:16] <exeakiel> Unreadable files in Wine?
[03:16] <JoshJ> in practice, anything ranging from using unofficial repo's to compiling from source to certain binaries might make it
[03:17] <Super_K> cause the other versions couldnt do it could they?
[03:17] <JoshJ> *make it not work
[03:17] <slavik> so, Beryl is awesome, what else is new?
[03:17] <JoshJ> you could in theory go hoary > breezy > dapper > edgy
[03:17] <deadlydeathcone> Just make a new user and use aptitude to track the dependencies
[03:17] <JoshJ> and probably edgy>feisty
[03:17] <achillez> hi guys - quick question - i added the 1400x1050 resolution to the xorg.conf but it is not showing up in the GUI resolution options - any idea why?
[03:17] <Super_K> but you have to uninstall it, and re-install to upgrade right?
[03:17] <JoshJ> no
[03:17] <Super_K> or has there always been an update thingie
[03:18] <JoshJ> before edgy, you edited your sources.list (basically find-replace breezy to dapper) then did an apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:18] <JoshJ> i think edgy had a different update method
[03:18] <Super_K> yeah
[03:18] <axa-axa> LjL: Sorry, my bad. Thanks.
[03:18] <Super_K> thats why its the best
[03:18] <steffl> achillez: did you restart X already?
[03:18] <Super_K> wow 2% done already
[03:18] <slavik> LjL: did I tell you that Beryl is awesome?
[03:19] <Skwid_> JoshJ: how do you do it now ?
[03:19] <Doow> slavik: I think you mentioned it =)
[03:19] <LjL> slavik: no, but then i didn't ask :P i just tried compiz very briefly once, but honestly i won't bother until it's standard stuff
[03:19] <agent> what is the default us english locale? en_US ISO-8859-1 or en_US-UTF-8 UTF-8 (or something else)?

[03:19] <achillez> it's almost as if xorg.conf has no effect
[03:20] <steffl> achillez: press ctrl + alt + backspce to verify it really restarts...
[03:20] <agent> anyone? im stuck at the prompt! ;)
[03:20] <Ecnassianer> pianoboy3333: Explain your problem and your configuration, list any error messages and we'll see what we can do. (You don't need to ask permission to ask for help ;) )

[03:21] <tsp> I did a 1s/$/ universe on my /etc/apt/sources.list, but apt-get update then apt-get instal nspr4-dev says it's going to remove gnome-panel and a bunch of other gnome stuff. is there a reason for this?
[03:21] <kalikiana> agent: should be en_US-UTF8

[03:22] <agent> kalikiana: do you know how to check what the current locale is set to?
[03:22] <pianoboy3333> Ecnassianer: look above please
[03:22] <JoshJ> your sudo password is your user password i think
[03:22] <exeakiel> Can someone help me?
[03:22] <JoshJ> so just change that in your user config
[03:23] <pianoboy3333> exeakiel: shoot

[03:30] <pianoboy3333> Can I get some help with a sound-juicer problem? I was ripping a rolling stones album into 192 kbps mp3's, and all of a sudden it crashed, so I removed the folder it ripped to, and tried again -- here's the terminal output: http://piano.juicemedia.tv/junk/sjerror
[03:30] <Ecnassianer> My Ubuntu box has two NICs and I'm using it as a NAT (ip masq) for my windows box. It's currently working correctly, however every time I restart my Ubuntu box my windows box's net connection doesn't come back up. However, when I run Firestarter on my Ubuntu box I can grab a new IP and the NAT works again. Any idea what Firestarter is doing that brings everything back up? (Or how can I tell Firestarter to do that at bootup?)
[03:30] <pianoboy3333> well... some of the terminal output, the rest got cut off
[03:30] <zypherone> I tried unmounting them, and that got rid of 'DellUtility', but when I try to do the same with 'DellRestore' I get 'umount: only root can unmount /dev/sda3 from /media/sda3'. Any ideas?
[03:30] <airgrace> JoshJ: What would i have to install, to use a chat client in command prompt?
[03:30] <mmmpie> can anybody tell me how to run xconfig? the install didnt set up my video card correctly, and I cant find it - I did try 'find / -iname conf' and while it found a few other confs xconfig didnt seem to be installed.
[03:31] <airgrace> JoshJ: *terminal
[03:31] <JoshJ> irssi
[03:31] <JoshJ> or bitchx
[03:31] <JoshJ> !irssi
[03:31] <ubotu> irssi is a command line interface IRC client ( "sudo apt-get install irssi" without the quotes to try it out )
[03:31] <JoshJ> !bitchx
[03:31] <ubotu> bitchx: Advanced Internet Relay Chat client. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:1.1-4ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1507 kB, installed size 6516 kB
[03:31] <achillez> ok still have same problem - can't seem to get resolution 1400x1050
[03:31] <airgrace> JoshJ: got it,
[03:31] <Atmospherian> i'm guessing 'cc' == 'gcc' because i created a symbolic called 'cc' that points to gcc and the makefile worked
[03:31] <airgrace> JoshJ: and what if i want for msn messenger?
[03:31] <achillez> xorg.conf file lists it as an option - but the Ubuntu GUI does not
[03:31] <JoshJ> amsn is GUI
[03:31] <JoshJ> gaim is GUI
[03:31] <tin_nqn> there is a command "irc"
[03:31] <JoshJ> not sure what uses the terminal
[03:31] <pianoboy3333> Can I get some help with a sound-juicer problem? I was ripping a rolling stones album into 192 kbps mp3's, and all of a sudden it crashed, so I removed the folder it ripped to, and tried again -- here's the terminal output: http://piano.juicemedia.tv/junk/sjerror some of it atleast, the rest got cut off...
[03:31] <airgrace> aha
[03:32] <tin_nqn> it's a text based irc client
[03:32] <airgrace> JoshJ: yeah i was looking for a non- gui version for the terminal, yeah i know about gaim.
[03:33] <tin_nqn> airgrace: try $ irc
[03:33] <kitche> airgrace: for all of the chat protocols or just irc?
[03:33] <achillez> under what circumstances would Xorg not follow what's listed in the xorg.conf file?
[03:35] <steffl> achillez: if there is a mistake in the config
[03:36] <tin_nqn> somebody know about kernel modules programming?
[03:36] <Zambezi> I couldn't make rsync work. I'm going to send files between two local computers. From Two to One. From Two /mnt/hhd2/Bla to One /home/One/Bla. How should I write?
[03:36] <lifepositive> pianoboy3333: ok!  done! :) im now running latest Thunderbird, ty
[03:36] <green_earz> tin_nqn: have a look at sudo aptitude show irssi-text
[03:36] <pianoboy3333> kk...
[03:37] <phrizer> airgrace, you could use irssi and bitlbee
[03:37] <tin_nqn> green_earz: I'm not who want a console chat
[03:37] <airgrace> kitche: nah, i am just looking for an alternative to the gaim gui. something that'll enable me to chat with friends from msn via terminal.
[03:37] <achillez> steffl: is there anyway to tell if there is a mistake in the config?
[03:37] <at0m> anyone find any reviews of linux on the PS3 yet?
[03:37] <achillez> any logs or anything?
[03:37] <airgrace> phrizer: yup, got it thanks :)
[03:38] <phrizer> airgrace, someone mentioned bitlbee?
[03:38] <phrizer> airgrace, k
[03:38] <kalikiana> Is there an Edgy Cinelerra package? I don't get it to compile.
[03:38] <lifepositive> pianoboy3333: ok np :)
[03:38] <airgrace> phrizer: not bitlbee, but irssi. i'll give bitlbee a try now
[03:38] <steffl> achillez: maybe in the xorg logs
[03:39] <phrizer> airgrace, Bitlbee is an IRC to other chat networks gateway
[03:39] <phrizer> airgrace, use your irc client for msn/icq etc.
[03:39] <kitche> airgrace: bitlbee you can connect to though irc by going to im.bitlbee.org you cna install it but I don't see a reason to really
[03:39] <lifepositive> whats /opt used for?  and is it safe to delete everything in /opt ?
[03:39] <steffl> but your Problem also could be also another thing
[03:39] <airgrace> phrizer: how would i connect to msn via irc?
[03:39] <Viaken> Anyone here gotten pmk working?
[03:39] <cirvin_fox> somethign has gone quite awry with my computer... i could not log into my desktop so i used dpkg to reconfigure gdm, and now its giving me a very odd error and i have very little UI
[03:40] <phrizer> airgrace, by connecting to irc.bitlbee.org
[03:40] <dfgas> what is the next screensize up from 1024x768?
[03:40] <kitche> lifepositive: it's for packages that don't come with the distro by default like /usr/local is for software that you compile yourself /opt is for packages that don't come with the distro
[03:40] <phrizer> airgrace, and following the bots instructions
=== hfgh is now known as flashnet
[03:40] <lifepositive> kitche: can it be emptied?
[03:40] <airgrace> phrizer: gotcha, i shall give it a shot.
[03:40] <phrizer> airgrace, sorry, im. bitlbee.org
[03:41] <achillez> steffl: I think this is because my ati driver is not reporting what's in the xorg.conf
[03:41] <airgrace> phrizer: yup
[03:41] <mmmpie> how do I configure my available screen resolutions?
[03:41] <kitche> lifepositive: yea but if their's something in there that you use then you'll won't be able to use it for example think java gets installed to /opt
[03:41] <achillez> in the log file it says: (WW) RADEON(0): Mode 1400x1050 is out of range.
[03:41] <Ecnassianer> My Ubuntu box has two NICs and I'm using it as a NAT (ip masq) for my windows box.

[04:04] <ddgbosi> uhm....
[04:04] <cirvin_fox> highlighted the folder with the files in it and hit delete
[04:04] <JoshJ> uh
[04:04] <cirvin_fox> unmounted the partition and then exited
[04:04] <airgrace> jrib: could you explain a bit more :), i am a bit new to this system.
[04:04] <ddgbosi> have u installed the codecs for mp3?
[04:04] <asdfasdfdd> the edgy installer cant display partitions but i can list partitions with fdisk as root, how can i run the installer as root?
[04:05] <jrib> airgrace: ah, my ! command just had ubotu send you a private message.  Did you receive it?
[04:05] <tsp> how can libnspr4-dev conflict with libnspr4?
[04:05] <kapputu> ddgbosi: yes
[04:05] <miso> hola hello
[04:05] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, the preamble to your question doesn't seem relevant to your question
[04:05] <steffl> cirvin_fox: did you reinstall?
[04:05] <airgrace> jrib: got it :)
[04:05] <cirvin_fox> the OS? egads no
[04:05] <sethk> cirvin_fox, what do you mean by the files not really being deleted?
[04:05] <airgrace> jrib: thanks :)
[04:05] <kapputu> and how do I get smb support for xmms?
[04:06] <cirvin_fox> they arent where i had them, but i still am missing 10 gigs of space
[04:06] <jrib> airgrace: np
[04:06] <cirvin_fox> checked /tmp/ and ./.trash
[04:06] <steffl> cirvin_fox: or did you just use the liveCD to boot and then used rm or nautlius to delete the file?
[04:06] <cirvin_fox> yes
[04:06] <steffl> *s
[04:06] <erath2> hi .. i have a backup of the folder '~/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers' .. i accidentally removed my panel.. created a new one.. restore de copy of launchers, but they dont appear?
[04:06] <sethk> cirvin_fox, try using find
[04:07] <sethk> cirvin_fox, do you want to get the files back, or do you want to really delete them?
[04:07] <cirvin_fox> i want to really delete them
[04:07] <steffl> cirvin_fox: did you use rm?
[04:07] <gotama> Hi there! How can I deactivate the hibernate option in the logout menu? Thanks a lot.
[04:07] <cirvin_fox> not when i did it on the livecd
[04:07] <miso> could i recover data if i reinstall ubuntu in all the hdisk?
[04:07] <sethk> cirvin_fox, if you had done it from the command line, they would be gone, but who knows what the gui really does.
[04:07] <sethk> miso, no
[04:07] <miso> argh
[04:08] <sethk> miso, if by recover you mean get data that has been deleted
[04:08] <cirvin_fox> not me, and i'm rather frsutrated over it.
[04:08] <sethk> miso, if you mean, can you install without deleting data, then yes, you can

[04:08] <nemik> hi, i have a problem. my comp crashed with beryl running and after turning it off and then on, it now cannot find the i810 module when automatically starting startx. but when i start it manually, it works. what is wrong?
[04:08] <nemik> whenever i restart it says x cannot find the i810 module
[04:08] <cirvin_fox> i had them in ./video so i highlighted the folder and hit the delete key
[04:08] <sethk> cirvin_fox, I would list out the entire file system in date order.  the deleted files would be near the end of the list.
[04:08] <cirvin_fox> how do i do that?
[04:08] <miso> files music films...
[04:08] <sethk> cirvin_fox, hold on, I'll paste the command line for it
[04:09] <cirvin_fox> sethk, thank you
[04:09] <sethk> cirvin_fox, I use a small script, but I'll condense it to one line.
[04:09] <kalikiana> Is there an Edgy Cinelerra package? I don't get it to compile.
[04:10] <miso> sethk hoy can in i could do it,  i tried partition copy but edgy never finish to update i finally hoare and now i am upgrading to dapper, so i can forget data arent  i?

[04:11] <slinky_> I have a generalized question, is KDE full of problems? Does it have a self-destructive nature?
[04:11] <asdfasdfdd> i tried launching through terminal as root still nothing
[04:11] <steffl> lol
[04:11] <sethk> cirvin_fox, I'll put the script on the paste web site; I can't find my one liner at the moment.  :)
[04:11] <Zambezi> Can anybody help me with rsync? I can't make it work.
[04:12] <airgrace> jrib: hey man, i am getting an error it says "could not calculate upgrade"
[04:12] <cirvin_fox> sethk, thanks, i appreciate it man:-)
[04:12] <jrib> airgrace: uh oh, can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
[04:12] <mnepton> Zambezi: what are you trying to do?
[04:12] <jrib> !pastebin > airgrace
[04:12] <airgrace> jrib: however i have an iso dowlnoaded of the latest version on my desktop, how can i install it from there?
[04:12] <jrib> airgrace: do you want to just install over your current install or upgrade?
[04:12] <Zambezi> mnepton, Send files between two computers at my LAN.
[04:13] <airgrace> jrib: i want to uprade from 6.06 to 6.10
[04:13] <mnepton> Zambezi: both Ubuntu? both Unix-y?
[04:13] <asdfasdfdd> sethk, any ideas?
[04:13] <jrib> airgrace: k, we need to take a look at /etc/apt/sources.list then
[04:13] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, hold on a few minutes, I have to finish something first
[04:13] <asdfasdfdd> k
[04:13] <slinky_> can I remove kubuntu-desktop from my Dapper Drake, without killing my system?
[04:13] <Zambezi> mnepton, Both Ubuntu Dapper drake. This with X, the other without.
[04:13] <jrib> !kubuntu-desktop | slinky_
[04:13] <ubotu> slinky_: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[04:14] <airgrace> jrib: can you guide me, i am relatively new to this and don't know much about the commands yet.
[04:14] <mnepton> Zambezi: "sudo apt-get install openssh-server" on both
[04:14] <axisys> looking for a cheap/used sipura 3000 or like device.. any site besides ebay?
[04:14] <Zambezi> mnepton, Alreday installed.
[04:14] <jrib> airgrace: k, just type 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' without the quotes in a terminal.  Then select the whole file, copy, and visit http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste your selection and make a post.  Afterwards, tell us the url
[04:15] <slinky_> thanks
[04:15] <mnepton> Zambezi: rsync -v -a -e ssh --delete /path/to/files/to/sync username@host.ip.address:/path/to/target/
[04:15] <cirvin_fox> sethk, ...?
[04:16] <airgrace> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32663/
[04:16] <Zambezi> mnepton, Delete means? I don't want to delete the files I'm transfering.
[04:16] <sethk> cirvin_fox, try this:  find / -type f | xargs ls -l --time-style=full-iso | sort '--key=6.1,7.20'
[04:16] <sethk> cirvin_fox, that's all one line, xchat may have divided it and/or your tool may divide it.
[04:16] <mnepton> Zambezi: "if it's not in the source path, delete it from the target path" (i.e. a backup copy)
[04:17] <asdfasdfdd> are all the packages available on both 32/64 bit versions?
[04:17] <cirvin_fox> sethk, this lists what again?
[04:17] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, no, most definitely not
[04:17] <sethk> cirvin_fox, all the files in time order
[04:17] <asdfasdfdd> recommend 32?
[04:17] <sethk> cirvin_fox, that is, modification time order.
[04:17] <sethk> cirvin_fox, you want to do > ~/output-file      at the end, to save the output
[04:17] <Zambezi> mnepton, Can we continue in PM?
[04:17] <sethk> cirvin_fox, the newest files will be at the end of the list
[04:18] <JunK-Y> i installed 6.10, after installing phppgadmin package, im still getting "Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option.", how can i fix this quickly?
[04:18] <mnepton> Zambezi: in 5 minutes.
[04:18] <sethk> cirvin_fox, the idea is, instead of deleting them, they were moved somewhere, and so their date stamp will be today
[04:18] <jrib> airgrace: your sources.list look fine, I'
[04:18] <jrib> airgrace: ... I'll see if I can find anything about your problem on malone
[04:18] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, 32, yes.  I really don't have any bright ideas about the installer.
[04:18] <airgrace> jrib: hmm...alright.
[04:19] <sethk> asdfasdfdd, use the text mode installer from the alternate cd.  it works.
[04:19] <klees> so i have XGL and Beryl working but when i do glxgears -printfps it asks me for a Display
[04:19] <sola6662> anyone know how to install the codec needed to play MP4 video files i can play them i jsut get no audio
[04:19] <klees> plus glxinfo | grep rending shows a No
[04:19] <z9999> Is this the correct place to request help on recording from a microphone in Ubuntu Dapper?
[04:20] <sola6662> anyone?
[04:20] <danc3> sola6662: did you search the package manager for "codec" ?
[04:20] <noiesmo> !w32codecs | sola6662
[04:20] <ubotu> sola6662: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:21] <jrib> airgrace: can you paste any files you have in /var/log/dist-upgrade/ ?
[04:21] <airgrace> jrib: sure
[04:21] <shini`> how can I check my xorg version
[04:22] <sola6662> Danc3 well not yet i can play the file its just i dont have audio on the MP4 files only
[04:22] <danc3> sola6662: perhaps you should do that, then
[04:22] <Pupeno> shini`: dpkg -l | grep xorg
[04:23] <Pupeno> shini`: ?
[04:23] <shini`> hmm
[04:23] <shini`> let me try
[04:23] <shini`> thanks PumpkinPie
[04:23] <shini`> er
[04:23] <shini`> Pupeno,
[04:23] <cirvin_fox> sethk, the files arent in there...
[04:23] <sola6662> k Danc3
[04:23] <sethk> cirvin_fox, not even by some other name?
[04:24] <JunK-Y> any ppl are using phppgadmin here?
[04:24] <airgrace> jrib: this is the apt log http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32664/
[04:24] <sethk> cirvin_fox, did you use    df -h    to check the empty file space?
[04:24] <Warbo> ANyone got experience with Mercury Messenger and/or webcams? My webcam works fine in Ekiga without any setup, but all Mercury sees is my TV capture card
[04:24] <shini`> is there another way to check, assuming you don't have dpkg installed
[04:24] <sola6662> danc3 what codec im looking for
[04:24] <danc3> sola6662: don't know, but I'd install all of 'em
[04:25] <airgrace> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32665/ main log
[04:25] <sola6662> well i got all of the GStreamers
[04:25] <nemik> hi, i have a problem. my comp crashed with beryl running and after turning it off and then on, it now cannot find the i810 module when automatically starting startx. but when i start it manually, it works. what is wrong?
[04:25] <airgrace> jrib: there is another log file called term; it
[04:25] <airgrace> jrib: empty
[04:25] <cirvin_fox> sethk, 340 megs left on 18 gig partition...i sure have made amess of things... is there a utility that can visually show me the size of everythign in the filesystem? the files woudl be noticable, theya re multi gig
[04:25] <sethk> nemik, try doing an fsck on the file system that crashed.  If you haven't yet done that.
[04:26] <nemik> sethk, thanks
[04:26] <tonyyarusso> Anyone that uses Seahorse, I need someone to check something.
[04:26] <jrib> airgrace: k, the second log says you have some broken packages.  Are you familiar with aptitude?
[04:26] <nemik> sethk, should i do that as root/sudo?
[04:26] <sethk> cirvin_fox, probably, but I'm not the one to ask, I only use command line for that sort of thing.  I'm sure people here can help you with a graphical version
[04:26] <airgrace> jrib: afraid not :\
[04:26] <ashika> nemik, its better to sudo
[04:26] <sethk> nemik, you must, yes.  If it's your root file system you probably want to boot the live cd to do it.
[04:26] <cirvin_fox> sethk, alright, thank you for the asstance, have you ever seen this sort of thing before?
[04:27] <airgrace> jrib: although ubuntu is downloading a few packages right now, maybe that might help.
[04:27] <nemik> oh ok, and that might fix these problems with the i810 thing? i know its there it works when startx run manually but just not initially.
[04:27] <JunK-Y> i installed 6.10, after installing phppgadmin package, im still getting "Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option.", how can i fix this quickly?
[04:27] <ashika> !compiling
[04:27] <nemik> sethk, oh ok, and that might fix these problems with the i810 thing? i know its there it works when startx run manually but just not initially.
[04:27] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[04:27] <Pelo> cirvin_fox,  what is your issue ?<
[04:27] <jrib> airgrace: ok, we'll wait for that to finish, let me know if it doesn't
[04:27] <JunK-Y> which package do i need to install or whatever solution?
[04:27] <airgrace> jrib: sure thing
[04:27] <cirvin_fox> pelo, i have some phantom files taking up 10 gigs of space on my drive
[04:28] <Pelo> cirvin_fox,  are you sure that isn'T your swap ?
[04:28] <JunK-Y> ashika: packages doesnt work well apparently.
[04:28] <cirvin_fox> pelo, yes,
[04:28] <ashika> JunK-Y, pardon? Are you talking to me?
[04:28] <Pelo> cirvin_fox,  and they are not simply hidden files ?
[04:28] <cirvin_fox> pelo, i deleted the files, video captured from my vid cam, with the livecd
[04:28] <JunK-Y> ashika: yse, only if u said !compiling for me.
[04:29] <ashika> JunK-Y, Junk recompile PHP from source with --with-pgsql as the option.
[04:29] <ashika> JunK-Y, Actually I was just typing it xD
[04:29] <Pelo> cirvin_fox,   check the /tmp/ folder
[04:29] <ashika> !php
[04:29] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP.

[04:29] <dogie> does antone know if the remote and receiver that came bundled with the nvidia personal cinema everything will work with lirc in ubuntu?
[04:29] <ashika> !phpgadmin
[04:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about phpgadmin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:30] <peabodi> is there a way to uninstall edfy and return to dapper?
[04:30] <ashika> dogie, probably not.
[04:30] <JunK-Y> !phppgadmin
[04:30] <cirvin_fox> pelo, checked and rechecked, no results
[04:30] <ubotu> phppgadmin: Set of PHP scripts to administrate PostgreSQL over the WWW. In component universe, is extra. Version 4.0.1-2 (edgy), package size 678 kB, installed size 3940 kB
[04:30] <Warbo> cirvin_fox: Incase nobody told you yet, boabab should show you filesystem usage
[04:30] <Warbo> !info baobab
[04:30] <ubotu> Package baobab does not exist in any distro I know
[04:30] <Pelo> peabodi, I'm out of ideas
[04:30] <Warbo> oops, wrong name
[04:30] <JunK-Y> something from 6.01 to 6.10 is really bad.
[04:30] <JunK-Y> with packages management related to postgres
[04:30] <Pelo> peabodi,   yeah,  back up your /home/user folder and resintall 6.06 from cd
[04:30] <danc3> peabodi: no.  you'll have to reinstall dapper if that's what you want
[04:31] <peabodi> yep
[04:31] <peabodi> i thought so
[04:31] <danc3> peabodi: why do you want to do that?
[04:31] <cirvin_fox> pelo, that program isnt on my system and apt-get cant find it
[04:31] <Megaqwerty> can anyone tell me of an app that will convert video to the xvid format?
[04:31] <Warbo> !info baobab
[04:31] <peabodi> edgy doesn't recognize my wireless card
[04:31] <ubotu> Package baobab does not exist in any distro I know
[04:31] <Warbo> Hmm, apt-cache can find it.....
[04:31] <Pelo> danc3,  cause edgy is not quite as noob freindly as dapper
[04:31] <peabodi> and the install was bad
[04:31] <danc3> peabodi: but dapper does?
[04:32] <peabodi> yep
[04:32] <Pelo> cirvin_fox,  I'm not the wone who recommended it
[04:32] <danc3> that doesn't make sense
[04:32] <sethk> cirvin_fox, we can list the files in size order also.  Or you can find the size of subdirectories, try to track them down that way.
[04:32] <sethk> cirvin_fox, did you answer my question about how you are looking at free space?
[04:32] <dogie> ashika thanks, I read on a site that someone had the tnt rivia personal cinema up  and it had the same tuner chipset that mine uses so I thought I would ask
[04:32] <sethk> cirvin_fox, are you using df -h?
[04:32] <peabodi> I'm a noob to ubuntu
[04:32] <cirvin_fox> sethk, yes
[04:32] <JabberWokky> Howdy all, is there a way to run an installer on a working system to install to a drive attached via USB (i.e., is there a package with an app that says "install Server Edition to /dev/sdb2")?
[04:32] <peabodi> been using Suse for 8-10 yrs
[04:32] <JunK-Y> why should i recompile my whole php, since ive installed php4-pgsql package?
[04:33] <sethk> cirvin_fox, ok.  you want the command line for listing in size order?
[04:33] <ashika> dogie, Sorry what remote and what software agfain? Ill double check for you
[04:33] <ashika> JunK-Y, Becuase postgre said to do that?
[04:33] <cirvin_fox> sethk, yes .. sorry for the hassle though...
[04:33] <ashika> JunK-Y, It says things for a reason
[04:33] <sethk> JunK-Y, you shouldn't, and odds are you would have to compile bunches of other stuff also
[04:33] <JunK-Y> and this was working fine on 6.01?
[04:33] <sethk> find / -name "$1" -print | xargs ls -l | sort -n +4
[04:33] <sethk> cirvin_fox, find / -name "$1" -print | xargs ls -l | sort -n +4
[04:33] <Pelo> !wireless | peabodi
[04:33] <ubotu> peabodi: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[04:34] <sethk> cirvin_fox, by the way, if you aren't root, you should put sudo in front of those commands, otherwise some things won't be listed
[04:34] <johnm1019> ive been having some problems with network manager, i read somewhere that you can 'purge configuration files' thought i'd give it a try, but have no clue where/how to do thtat --thoughts?
[04:34] <JunK-Y> sethk: why ive the exact package from 6.01 (now on 6.10) and this isnt working?
[04:34] <cirvin_fox> sethk, ...oh
[04:34] <dogie> askika, it was a nvida gforce2 mx 400 personl cinema everything it has a breakout box with the tuner and ir receiver incorporated
[04:34] <sethk> JunK-Y, do you mean it was working in 6.01, but not working in 6.10?
[04:34] <peabodi> even lshw doesn't show it
[04:34] <sethk> cirvin_fox, if you didn't, you should repeat the one that lists in date order also
[04:35] <JunK-Y> sethk: exact.
[04:35] <ashika> JunK-Y, You shouldnt have upgraded then. There are many bugs. Didnt you read the warnings when upgrading? it said caution API unstable + other things.
[04:35] <sethk> JunK-Y, seems extremely unlikely that recompiling is the answer, as you've obviously already intuited
[04:35] <ashika> JunK-Y, sethk it could have got corrupted somehow
[04:35] <JunK-Y> sethk: it said nothing about php and postgres.
[04:35] <sethk> ashika, indeed, it could
[04:36] <sethk> JunK-Y, you mean the warnings?  that doesn't matter.
[04:36] <ashika> JunK-Y, make sure you have all required libraries.
[04:36] <graveson> any ideas why can i not have more than1  toolbar folders in firefox
[04:36] <z9999> Any help available here?
[04:36] <ashika> sethk, I was saying that some things on Dapper need bug fixes to work on Edgy
[04:36] <gotama> How to disable the hibernate option? Help please.
[04:36] <danc3> z9999: sure, for what?
[04:36] <sethk> graveson, are you sure one isn't personal toolbar?
[04:36] <Pelo> z9999,  abosutely not
[04:36] <sethk> ashika, yes, that's true.  I don't know if php is one of them, however
[04:37] <Olathe> How do I add section 3 of the manpages to my system ?
[04:37] <JunK-Y> ashika: i think i have, ive EXACT packages related to php from my other box, which is 6.01.
[04:37] <ashika> sethk, JunK-Y, Only other options: missing libraries and corrupted version.
[04:37] <graveson> sethk: sorry what do you mea by personal bar
[04:37] <sethk> JunK-Y, possibly they broke out the system into more package files for 6.10.  there might be a missing package, even though that package wasn't needed, or even didn't exist, in 6.1
[04:37] <danc3> z9999: ???
[04:38] <ashika> graveson, He means the bar at the top of the screen with Applications, System etc.
[04:38] <z9999> danc3: Trying to record from a microphone using sound recorder in Dapper
[04:38] <loca|host> how to get informations about installed printers in console ?
[04:38] <JunK-Y> sethk: i dont see how package php4-pgsql could be splitted .
[04:38] <danc3> z9999: is the mic unmuted?  run 'alsamixer' and check
[04:38] <sethk> graveson, I've seen two slightly different bookmark folder names in firefox, one with "personal" and one without.  just asking if that might be relevant
[04:38] <Hajiki> hey guys is there an ubuntu button like those GetFirefox ones for my html code??
[04:38] <danc3> probably muted
[04:38] <cirvin_fox> sethk, the listing by size is only applicable for the current directory
[04:38] <sethk> cirvin_fox, no, it isn't
[04:38] <sethk> cirvin_fox, not with the command line I gave you
[04:39] <ashika> JunK-Y, obviously then if your'e acting so smart you know more than us and just do it your way. Just download every PHP package 1 by one and check if it works. Other than that recompile is your only option or go back to dapper.
[04:39] <sethk> cirvin_fox, if you use some other command, then sure, it is
[04:39] <graveson> sethk: i have a live feed toolbar,and although i am allowed to add an additional toolbar i just cannot see this 2nd toolbar
[04:39] <z9999> danc3: Mike is not muted.
[04:39] <sethk> cirvin_fox, but I gave you a command to use that doesn't have that problem.  if --sort=size were enough, I would have just told you to do that.
[04:39] <danc3> z9999: dunno then
[04:39] <PWill> gar!! nm-applet is acting up like crazy. anyone else been having problems?
[04:39] <sethk> graveson, sounds like your problem is different than what I'm thinking of
[04:40] <sethk> graveson, only one of them shows up, I presume,
[04:40] <bunnythebunny> Hey guys, how do i update my Alsa drivers?
[04:40] <Warbo> Hajiki: I think there are some things like that on the Wiki (wiki.ubuntu.com) try looking around through CatagoryMarketing
[04:40] <cirvin_fox> sethk, i used your command, and i'm not getting anything
[04:40] <sethk> graveson, how it got there I really can't even theorize about.
[04:40] <cO_17_cr_tmn> ce-MACAN
[04:40] <Hajiki> ok
[04:40] <danc3> bunnythebunny: why do you think you need to do that?
[04:40] <JunK-Y> ashika: so ur conclusion is almost like: go back to dapper?
[04:40] <cirvin_fox> sethk, relevant that is, the file doesnt exist it seems
[04:41] <sethk> cirvin_fox, that's possible
[04:41] <Pelo> graveson, ,  righclick, personnolise,  add new toolbar
[04:41] <ashika> JunK-Y, recompile, download every php package and check if anything happened and then if all else fails go back to dapper or do a fresh install if you just upgraded.
[04:41] <z9999> danc3: Any idea where to go for help? Have been on the forums for over a month reading FAQs and asking questions to no avail.
[04:41] <Pelo> customise I mean
[04:41] <JunK-Y> ive wasted more then 10 hours on that problem, im here to solve problem, cause theres a problem.

[04:41] <sethk> cirvin_fox, could you be mistaken about how much space was available before, and then after, the delete?
[04:41] <cO_17_cr_tmn> CE CANTIK
[04:41] <danc3> z9999: nope, don't know
[04:41] <bunnythebunny> danc3: Well, my sound system is screwed. Only my center and right speakers work. I've unmuted everything.
[04:41] <Pelo> z9999,  if you'd asked your question in public someone else might have had the answer
[04:41] <JunK-Y> ashika: ive nothing to recompiled, im using all ubuntu packages!
[04:41] <sky123> hello..so there is no ubuntu-sparc channel..due to popular misconception...where can you get help with ubuntu sparc issues?
[04:41] <bunnythebunny> danc3: I've got a 5.1 system.
[04:41] <sethk> JunK-Y, is it practical for you to downgrade?
[04:42] <danc3> bunnythebunny: are you sure it isn't a hardware/wiring issue?
[04:42] <JunK-Y> ive installed from 6.10 cd.
[04:42] <bunnythebunny> danc3: works just fine in xp!
[04:42] <sethk> JunK-Y, you can certainly compile it, but it won't be as simple as it might seem as first.
[04:42] <dogie>  ashika, it was a nvida gforce2 mx 400 personl cinema everything it has a breakout box with the tuner and ir receiver incorporated
[04:42] <z9999> Pelo: I'm new to irc, can you direct me how ro get there?
[04:42] <danc3> bunnythebunny: I'd uninstall and then reinstall ALSA in Synaptic
[04:42] <graveson> pelo: i am allowed to it ,but once i close the add toolbr dialogue my new toolbar dissapears
[04:42] <sethk> bunnythebunny, has to be configuration
[04:42] <cirvin_fox> sethk, beforei began the capture from my DV cam, i had 10 gigs free, i ran until it was full and it gave me errors. all the files where in  ./video/ and i deleted that with the livecd after i rebooted into the livecd
[04:42] <ashika> dogie, what software do you wnat to use it with
[04:42] <sethk> bunnythebunny, something must be set to mono somewhere
[04:42] <dogie> myth ank lirc
[04:43] <Pelo> z9999,  what is your issue ?
[04:43] <sethk> cirvin_fox, do you have more than one partition?
[04:43] <dogie> myth and lirc sorry
[04:43] <cirvin_fox> sethk, yes
[04:43] <ashika> JunK-Y, try download source and compiling it with the options postgre told you to compile it with.
[04:43] <overridex> does anyone know how to disable the wireframe animation in gnome when launching an app from the panel?
[04:43] <ashika> JunK-Y, sorry short of going back to dapper thats all you can do.
[04:43] <z9999> Pelo: Trying to record from mike doesn't work.
[04:43] <JunK-Y> sethk: i know, but id like to avoid that way, since its so time-cumsoming in production env, compared to n packages.
[04:43] <sethk> cirvin_fox, possible the video was being stored to a different partition, and that partition ran out of space?
[04:43] <cirvin_fox> sethk, that might be it
[04:43] <cirvin_fox> sethk, no wait, no
[04:43] <peabodi> hmm it says it won't work outta the box on Dapper/Edgy but it did on dapper
[04:43] <sethk> JunK-Y, indeed, but what alternatives do we have?
[04:43] <bunnythebunny> sethk, well, Surround is up, LFC is up, Master is up, Center is up, PCM is up,
=== cO_17_cr_tmn is now known as CE
[04:44] <xabbott> xine vs gstreamer...which one should i be using? >.>
[04:44] <sethk> bunnythebunny, it isn't anything obvious like that, or you would have found it long ago
[04:44] <Pelo> z9999,  open up the terminal and type alsamixer,  see if something in there can'T help you
[04:44] <JunK-Y> fix the packages wich isnt correct?
[04:44] <cirvin_fox> sethk, i only have one partition mounted, but i did go and copy those files over to hda2 before i deleted from hda1
[04:44] <loca|host> how to get informations about installed printers in console ?
[04:44] <sethk> cirvin_fox, I'm just thinking out loud, really, trying to explain what you've reported.
[04:44] <sethk> cirvin_fox, doesn't mean my thoughts are correct.  :)
[04:44] <ashika> JunK-Y, are you talking to me or sethk?
[04:45] <sethk> JunK-Y, how?
[04:45] <JunK-Y> ashika: to seth.
[04:45] <sethk> JunK-Y, when you fix a package, you replace the bad files with good files.    where are the good files going to come from?
[04:45] <keith> I installed Edgy fresh on my Desktop this morning, and I got sound out of my 5.1 card, worked great. I rebooted, now it's showing my onboard sound as primary (and it's even disabled in BIOS). How can I make my sound go back out of my Sound Blaster?
[04:45] <cirvin_fox> sethk, it seems to me that the files are still taking up space, but there is no refrence to them in whatever ext3 uses to determin the start of files
[04:45] <JunK-Y> sethk: make sure the package is fully backward, only by using php4 and php4-pgsql both are working.
[04:45] <sethk> JunK-Y, it's really tough to try to narrow down, because the symbols are stripped from all the binaries.
[04:45] <Pelo> bunnythebunny, ,  did you turn on mastersound surrond in alsamixer ?
[04:46] <sethk> cirvin_fox, try running fsck
[04:46] <sola6662> yo does any1 know howt to install Teamspeak on ubuntu?
[04:46] <bunnythebunny> sethk, :(. But the thing is, i've tried a sort of ...trick...into making them all work, from gentoo wiki i think....which basically implies in making a .asoundrc file in the home directory. They all work. the only problem then is that eventually it starts making odd cracklings and the system sort of "stops" ..kinda like a scratched record.
[04:46] <overridex> keith: my ghetto way of doing it was removing the module for the onboard card in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)
[04:46] <sethk> cirvin_fox, if your theory is correct, your file system is inconsistent.  that's certainly possible if you ran out of space and had to reboot.
[04:46] <danc3> sola6662: same way you'd install it on any other distro
[04:46] <bunnythebunny> Pelo, just surround and master..
[04:46] <ashika> dogie, for lirc you need the drivers from linuxtv.org for your card.
[04:46] <danc3> sola6662: download, unpack, run the script installer.
[04:46] <ashika> dogie, unless you already have the linux drivers
[04:46] <bunnythebunny> sethk, they all work = my speakers.
[04:46] <sethk> bunnythebunny, can you put the .asound file on the paste site?  maybe that will trigger someone's memory about something
[04:46] <sola6662> well i dont know how to do that
[04:47] <bullgard1> In Gnome 2.14.3 the Main Menu > System > Finish(?) will show a dialog with 7 buttons. What are the English names of the 4th and 5th button? suspend-to-RAM?, suspend-to-disk? or what?
[04:47] <danc3> sola6662: don't know how to do what?
[04:47] <ashika> dogie, Dogie I just triple checked as long as you have all drivers everything will work fine. Nearly every model is supported.
[04:47] <bunnythebunny> alright will do
[04:47] <cirvin_fox> sethk, it seemed to have to fix the table, still low on storage, but perhaps my ./video folger came back
[04:47] <ashika> dogie, Your IR may or may not work I have no clue its 50-50.
[04:47] <sola6662> is there like a ez way to install it?
[04:47] <ashika> dogie, some IR devices seem to work while others dont. Dongles for example dont work
[04:47] <danc3> sola6662: I just told you the easy way
[04:47] <sethk> cirvin_fox, ok.  it's your root file system, so you are going to have to run fsck as root, with the file system unmounted
=== joli_ is now known as joli
[04:48] <ashika> sola6662, you mean server or client?
[04:48] <sola6662> client
[04:48] <ashika> dogie, Good luck dogie
[04:48] <keith> overridex: How can I remove the module?
[04:48] <sethk> cirvin_fox, that means either you do fsck after booting the live cd (preferred)  or shutdown with the form of shutdown that forces fsck on the next boot.  I'll get that command for you ...
[04:48] <z9999> Pelo: Alsamixer shows Master and Capture maxed out, but I don't know how to dispplay Capture from this view
[04:48] <sola6662> just the client
[04:48] <ashika> sola6662, http://www.goteamspeak.com/index.php?page=downloads&id=2a
[04:48] <cirvin_fox> sethk, yah, methinks i will want to shy away from the livecd...
[04:48] <Pelo> z9999,  <tab>
[04:48] <sethk> cirvin_fox, from the command line:        sudo shutdown -F now
[04:49] <sola6662> im downloading it now
[04:49] <JunK-Y> sethk, ashika thx, i will just put an X on 6.10
[04:49] <sola6662> same path?>
[04:49] <sethk> cirvin_fox, all you would have to do with the live cd is:    fsck.ext3 -f /dev/hda1
[04:49] <ashika> JunK-Y, an X?
[04:49] <sethk> cirvin_fox, assuming it's an ext3 file system and hda1 is the correct partition
[04:49] <ashika> sola6662, whatever path you want.
[04:49] <JunK-Y> wont use it anymore for my customers.
[04:49] <sola6662> ok then whats next?
[04:49] <cirvin_fox> sethk, thanks very much, i guess i shall see you on the other side...
[04:49] <sethk> JunK-Y, not a bad idea, give them some time to get the wrinkles out.
[04:49] <ashika> sola6662, make sure to put execute permissions on the file.
[04:49] <ashika> JunK-Y, or recompile.. your choise.
[04:49] <z9999> Pelo: Ok, that should have been Master, PCM and Capture are 100<>100
[04:50] <danc3> sola6662: unpack it and read the instructions
[04:50] <JunK-Y> ashika: ive tried to compile php 5.2.0 and all shits happened.
[04:50] <grndslm> i just did a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy.....and now it complains about not being able to load the i810 module and not being able to find a screen...can anybody help me?
[04:50] <Pelo> z9999,  I don'T have a mic to check , that was my best guess
[04:50] <dogie> ashika Ill check there but I am not intrested in the tuner I have a happauge 500 set up I was just trying to utilize the IR portion as I am using the tv out from the  breakout box, but I still have a problem with the tv out even though the nvidia settings allow me to enable it when I restart the x-session it fails and I have to restore the preivious conf file, but maybe that is my problem
[04:50] <ashika> JunK-Y, do you have the dev files?
[04:51] <ashika> dogie, Try but make sure you have the drivers for the card as it also contains IR portion drivers. This will work 50-50
[04:51] <JunK-Y> ive the whole php src files.
[04:51] <ashika> JunK-Y, do you have compiling libraries?
[04:51] <sethk> JunK-Y, it is possible to compile, but it's far from trivial
[04:51] <z9999> Pelo: I'm using a brand new Compaq Notebook, with built in Mikes, plus tried plugging in an external mike.
[04:51] <sethk> JunK-Y, I've done it, but I'm a developer and I can track down all the nasty messages and figure out where they are coming from.
[04:52] <Pelo> z9999,  try looking up your notebook model number in the forum
[04:52] <sethk> JunK-Y, it's not really all that hard, but it is intimidating to some people
[04:52] <JunK-Y> ive configured --with-pgsql , make, make install
[04:52] <dogie> ashika ,sorry I am a little green actually very green but I need other drivers then the drivers I installed from Nvidias site?
[04:52] <nemik> so after a system crash, i'm having problems even after an fsck. xorg won't load saying i810 module doesn't exist, but when i do startx manually, it boots fine.
[04:52] <JunK-Y> but i was still getting the same errors
[04:52] <sola6662> "To install using the gui, just startup "setup.sh"
[04:52] <JunK-Y> prolly i missed something.
[04:52] <ashika> dogie, oh you installed the linux drivers? Did you run LIRC
[04:53] <peabodi> junky i always compiled php otherwise I don't get the neccessary modukes
[04:53] <overridex> keith: if you know the module name of the onboard card (check lsmod and look for snd-something when it's running, emu10k1 is a sound blaster, so it's not that one...) and just do a find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) | grep modulename to find any of it in there, and use mv to move them somewhere else
[04:53] <sola6662> i really dont get this
[04:53] <z9999> Pelo: I've been trying the forum for over a month now, and the list of unsolved problems is just growing.
[04:53] <danc3> sola6662: what don't you get?
[04:53] <JunK-Y> peabodi: how exactly?
[04:53] <ashika> dogie, so dogie whats the problem?
[04:53] <overridex> keith: there's probably a better way to do it, i just don't know it right off - this way will undo once you upgrade your kernel...
[04:53] <overridex> does anyone know how to disable the wireframe animation in gnome when launching an app from the panel?
[04:53] <sola6662> i run the Setup file just like it says but nuttin happined
[04:54] <dogie> not yet I am trying to gather as much info as I can before I attempt lirc and I have read that there a few bugs with edgy, just doing my homeworg
[04:54] <ashika> JunK-Y, did you run make with sudo prefix?
[04:54] <peabodi> configure --help forthe neccessary flags
[04:54] <danc3> sola6662: what command did you run?
[04:54] <Pelo> z9999,  my last guess is ,  system > prefs > sound , make sure the right soundcard is selected for capture
[04:54] <JunK-Y> a simple php page with pg_connect(foo); failed.
[04:54] <benkong2> hello all
[04:54] <sola6662> thats the point i dont know
[04:54] <JunK-Y> im in root, i dont run sudo.
[04:54] <danc3> sola6662: no, you said you ran the installer.  How did you do that?
[04:54] <ashika> dogie, Dogie try running lirc now and see if it works. In my opinion I think it will work as you have everything done good. I wish you good luck and let me know how it fares out.
[04:54] <benkong2> could someone tell me why my mouse scroll dies after about two hours? When I first boot the system it works.
[04:55] <JunK-Y> peabodi: like i said, i ./configure --with-pgsql
=== rex_binary is now known as rexbinary
[04:55] <peabodi> configure and make usually don't require root or sudo just make install
[04:55] <ashika> JunK-Y, wouldn't --with-pgsql go with the make command?
[04:55] <sola6662> double click
[04:55] <dogie> ashika, ok gonna try it in a bit thanks
[04:55] <peabodi> and your error warnings say?
[04:55] <sola6662> then run
[04:55] <ashika> dogie, let me know! im interested in your result.
[04:55] <JunK-Y> ashika: no, this is with configure.
[04:55] <danc3> sola6662: that's not what the instructions say to do, is it?
[04:55] <ashika> JunK-Y, whats your error. C&P
[04:55] <sola6662> yes

[04:56] <peabodi> error warnings from configure?
[04:56] <Pelo> z9999,  stupid qestion here but have you installed the nvidia drivers ?
[04:56] <bunnythebunny> if anyone would like to take a look and try to help, i'd appreciate it.
[04:56] <JunK-Y> no, this is after, im trying to execute my php script.
[04:56] <danc3> sola6662: then, type this command:  chmod +x setup.sh
[04:56] <benkong2> how can I tell if /dev/input/mice is the correct location for the mouse?
[04:56] <sola6662> so what commend line will i need to use
[04:56] <Virtuall> JunK-Y, sorry, i missed the beginning, why don't youn install PHP from APT, anyway?
[04:56] <JunK-Y> ashika: theres no errors on compiling.
[04:57] <ashika> JunK-Y, no errors during configure or compile or install?
[04:57] <vnDW> is there a way I can get a REAL root on ubuntu?
[04:57] <JunK-Y> APT?
[04:57] <danc3> sola6662: then, use this command:   ./setup.sh
[04:57] <JunK-Y> nope
[04:57] <ashika> vnDW, you mean like no gnome or KDE?
[04:57] <peabodi> then pgsql isn't recognized
[04:57] <danc3> sola6662: note the period in front of that....
[04:57] <ashika> JunK-Y, then your files are your problem...
[04:57] <Virtuall> JunK-Y, m... you-re on ubuntu, right?
[04:57] <achillez> anyone ever try building the ati driver for ubuntu using --builpkg?
[04:57] <achillez> er --buildpkg
[04:57] <JunK-Y> ashika: nope, this is something with php
[04:57] <Virtuall> JunK-Y, sudo apt-get install php5 php5-pgsql -- why not?
[04:57] <peabodi> try php -m | grep pgsql from the command line
[04:57] <sola6662> i know

[04:57] <JunK-Y> Virtuall: yes.
[04:57] <sethk> Virtuall, he's been at this for hours, checked all the obvious stuff ages ago

[04:57] <sola6662> chmod: cannot access `setup.sh': No such file or directory"
[04:57] <nemik> how do i reboot or reload kernel modules?
[04:58] <ashika> vnDW, use sudo -i or login with root as your user. Did you set the root password?
[04:58] <JunK-Y> root@clea:/var/www# php -m | grep pgsql
[04:58] <JunK-Y> pgsql
[04:58] <JunK-Y> root@clea:/var/www#
[04:58] <danc3> sola6662: you are not in the directory that you extracted it to
[04:58] <sethk> Virtuall, he's installed the same set of packages that worked on 6.1, so it's nothing obvious
[04:58] <Virtuall> :
[04:58] <z9999> Pelo: Is a new computer with Ubuntu pre-installed, Any idea how to verify they are installed correctly? And, mp3's  play fine, just can't record from the mike.
[04:58] <Virtuall> very strange
[04:58] <sola6662> well extracted the stuff to my desktop cuz i didnt know where to extract to
[04:58] <peabodi> then php -i | grep pgsql
[04:58] <sethk> JunK-Y, in your position, I think I would dump the file list of each package from the old and the new packages, and see what's changed.
[04:59] <Pelo> z9999,  if it is pre-installed I would have a chat with whom ever did the pre-installation
[04:59] <sethk> JunK-Y, you didn't find any postings about this problem anywhere?
[04:59] <JunK-Y> sethk: in console, everything is perfect, this is via apache the problem.
[04:59] <danc3> sola6662: try this command first:  cd ~/Desktop
[04:59] <vn> ok, back
[04:59] <landexem> A lot of things are working on this MacBook Pro with Edgy, but still no sound out of the speakers (the headphone port works though)

[05:00] <sethk> JunK-Y, I don't see how that changes what I suggested.
[05:00] <peabodi> the only other thing it might be is you have 2 different php binaries one with pgsql and one without
[05:00] <danc3> sola6662: that isn't what I said to type
[05:00] <vn> I just isntalled xubuntu Edgy and can't get to my root and sudo doesn't allow me to have interaction with my own comments....how can I change the root password and use it?
[05:00] <sola6662> ....
[05:00] <danc3> sola6662: note:  Desktop
[05:00] <sethk> sola6662, desktop has a capital D, plus t
[05:00] <danc3> see the capital D ?
[05:00] <danc3> jeeez
[05:00] <z9999> Pelo: I'm in Thailand, so that's not very easy to do. Currently in National forest near Laos.
[05:00] <sethk> sola6662, might not be a bad idea to paste the command from the IRC client
[05:01] <Pelo> z9999,   well, good luck then
[05:01] <JunK-Y> and if i run phpinfo(); i see PHP Version 5.1.6, but the problem is ive compiled 5.2.0
[05:01] <sola6662> ok cool i got it
[05:01] <achillez> I get this when I try to build
[05:01] <Pelo> isn't there a nvidia channel ?
[05:01] <danc3> sola6662: good

[05:01] <peabodi> did you run make and make install ?
[05:01] <z9999> Pelo: Thanks for the time, I'll keep trying
[05:01] <JunK-Y> peabodi: of course.
[05:02] <sola6662> now what from this point?
[05:02] <sethk> achillez, you are running under a different shell
[05:02] <Pelo> z9999,  there is a #nvidia channel , try your luck there
[05:02] <nemik> so after a system crash, i'm having problems even after an fsck. xorg won't load saying i810 module doesn't exist, but when i do startx manually, it boots fine.
[05:02] <danc3> sola6662: follow the installer
[05:02] <JunK-Y> just my configure make and make install
[05:02] <sethk> achillez, pushd is a shell built in for bash and for zsh and ksh
[05:02] <peabodi> then you are seeing  a differnt inary
[05:02] <sola6662> huh
[05:02] <Lahey> d
[05:02] <danc3> sola6662: did the graphical installer start?
[05:02] <peabodi> probably one in /usr/bin and one in /usr/local/bin
[05:02] <JunK-Y> maybe, but i suspect libapache2-mod-php5
[05:02] <Cat2> does anyone know if there is a bug in Edgy that causes problems networking with a Windows PC? I get a "location is not a folder" error message, but if I refresh the network file browser once or twice it finally works and I can finally browse my Windows PC's shared folder
[05:02] <JunK-Y> (ubuntu package)
[05:02] <Riyonuk> By setting a partition to fat32, it will show up under windows and ubuntu with no extra configuration whatsoever?
[05:02] <sola6662> canc3 u dont know how lost i em
[05:03] <z9999> Pelo: Great idea, I'll give that a try. And thanks very much.
[05:03] <achillez> sethk: I'm not sure if thats the prob
[05:03] <achillez> when I try to run bash it still fails
[05:03] <sola6662> danc3*
[05:03] <danc3> sola6662: now that you're in the directory, use the command:  chmod +x setup.sh
[05:03] <grndslm> i just did a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy.....and now it complains about not being able to load the i810 module and not being able to find a screen...can anybody help me?
[05:03] <peabodi> do a find /usr -name php
[05:03] <danc3> sola6662: then do:  ./setup.sh
[05:03] <sethk> achillez, it might not be the problem, but we can't help you unless we see error messages that make sense.  also, put them on the paste web site, don't flood the channel
[05:03] <sethk> !paste
[05:03] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)

[05:04] <danc3> sola6662: OK, do this:  ls
[05:04] <sethk> achillez, and even if you run under bash, a sub-shell of another sort may well be started.
[05:04] <airgrace> jrib: is there a command to check the current version of the distro?
[05:04] <danc3> and look for a directory named something like Teamspeak
[05:04] <sethk> achillez, I wonder if this is relevant to the fact that the default shell changed in edgy.

[05:05] <airgrace> jrib: Yeah, it's successfully upgraded it to 6.10
[05:05] <sethk> achillez, let me find the name ; I haven't installed edgy on the box I used most of the time, so I have to look at another box.
[05:05] <danc3> and see if you see a file named "setup.sh"
[05:05] <dobblego> how do I add more workspaces?
[05:05] <Riyonuk> Fat32 has a size limit? WTF?
[05:05] <airgrace> jrib: not quite sure how it did it, but it's done.
[05:05] <jrib> JunK-Y: I haven't really been following, but I noticed that phpgadmin seems to require apache (1) not apache2
[05:05] <kitche> sethk: think it's called dash
[05:06] <achillez> sethk: k, I'll try messing around w/ the shell
[05:06] <sethk> achillez, dash, possibly?  at first I thought it might be one of the busybox shells, but then I checked and it isn't.

[05:06] <peabodi> and you have apache built as an sapi in php?

[05:06] <jrib> airgrace: lol ok, run 'sudo apt-get -s dist-upgrade' and see what it says.  With -s it won't actually do anything, it will just report what it wants to do
[05:06] <sethk> achillez, that might be irrelevant, but with it reporting that it can't find a shell built in, it's suspicious.
[05:06] <eugman> Mozilla is defaulting to totem instead of mplayer for embeded media. How do I change that?
[05:06] <sethk> achillez, might have to code a binary pushd/popd, which would be fun.
[05:06] <sola6662> did i do it wrong?

[05:21] <Pelo> thomas,  look for ver refrsh and horiz sync ( or maybe the other way around)
[05:21] <danc3> thomas: no, you need to research it, look int he manual
[05:21] <bunnythebunny> sethk...well, can i do that, save it in a file, and mail it to some place where they'll actually look at it?
[05:21] <vn> anyone can gimme some apt sources for edgy please?
[05:21] <ashika> airgrace, what are you trying to do
[05:21] <slon`> I'll soon find out
[05:21] <thomas> danc3: lol, don't have a manual
[05:21] <airgrace> yup, i just installed linux today itself, i don't have any data on this laptop at all. apart from the fact that i installed xfce.
[05:21] <ashika> vn, they are thesame as for dapper
[05:21] <sethk> bunnythebunny, I don't know who would look.
[05:21] <danc3> thomas: google it
[05:21] <draeath> Whats a good log viewer that would work in Xubuntu without installing half of gnome or KDE? preferably with simple filters (i don't yet understand regex)
[05:21] <danc3> duh
[05:21] <sethk> bunnythebunny, let me think about it for a bit.
[05:21] <ashika> airgrace, what are you trying to do.
[05:21] <Pelo> thomas,  look for specs online, google your montor make and model
[05:21] <bunnythebunny> sethk alright
[05:21] <airgrace> ashika: i tried updating to 6.10, it seems that it messed up somwhere.
[05:21] <ashika> airgrace, no you didn't.
[05:22] <jrib> airgrace: well you know it will probably be easier for you to just popup in the 6.10 disk and install over it.  But I can guide you through upgrading through the command line if you want
[05:22] <ashika> airgrace, open up teminal and type sudo updatemanager -c
[05:22] <thomas> danc3: thanks for the attitude :P
[05:22] <vn> ashika: then, I'd be looking for good soruces for dapper/edgy :p
[05:22] <thomas> Pelo: will do
[05:22] <ashika> vn, do you have GNOME?
[05:22] <danc3> thomas: who ties your shoes for you in the morning?
[05:22] <vn> no, xfce
[05:22] <airgrace> ashika: have done it a few times,
[05:22] <ashika> vn, isn't there synaptic manager
[05:22] <airgrace> ashika: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32671/
[05:22] <ashika> airgrace, did you run it with sudo and -c
[05:22] <thomas> danc3: didn't realise i was on #debian
[05:22] <airgrace> jrib: command line would be perfect, i haven't made a copy of the distro on cd yet.
[05:23] <danc3> thomas: you're not
[05:23] <ashika> airgrace, that should be there.
[05:23] <vn> ashika: thanks, didnt know
[05:23] <ashika> airgrace, just ignore it and continue
[05:23] <vn> HOLY cow..so much stuff, nice app
[05:23] <jrib> airgrace: ok, first, do you have the ubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop packages installed?
[05:23] <dennister> hello ppls
[05:24] <airgrace> jrib: how do i go about checking that?
[05:24] <jrib> airgrace: apt-cache policy xubuntu-desktop ubuntu-desktop
[05:24] <nemik> so is xorg-air-core installed by default in edgy?
[05:25] <dennister> Q: how do u convert a pl script into a daemon that stays up?

[05:26] <jrib> airgrace: yep, ok, next step is to change all instances of "dapper" to "edgy" in your /etc/apt/sources.list.  Quick way:  sudo sed -i 's/dapper/edgy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:26] <draeath> How do you all review your /var/log files?
[05:27] <draeath> airgrace, whatch that command! if you have any third-party repos it may cause them to fail
[05:27] <dennister> anyone? making a script into a daemon?
[05:27] <airgrace> jrib: yup, just c&p it.
[05:27] <Pelo> dennister,  sorry
[05:27] <airgrace> draeath: aye, thanks for the advice. I am still pretty much new to the system.
[05:27] <nemik> any of you with beryl in edgy, can you please tell me what your /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom looks like?
[05:27] <jrib> airgrace: ok,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:27] <draeath> dennister, poke about in /etc/init.d and see how it's done
[05:28] <dmb> any of you know what this means:
[05:28] <dmb> fusermount: failed to access mountpoint /home/dmbtech/visible: Permission denied

[05:28] <peabodi> dennister did you try putting it your .profile file?
[05:28] <airgrace> jrib: command is executing...
[05:28] <jrib> airgrace: once that completes, you'll have to run 'sudo apt-get dist-ugprade' again (remember this, because I'll probably forget)
[05:29] <tuv> gkrellm uses too much cpu on recent kernels. older kernels did not have this issue. any hints?
[05:29] <draeath> airgrace, while that command is running, you may have issues (programs being updated as you use them...)
[05:29] <airgrace> jrib: sure thing.
[05:29] <jrib> airgrace: and hopefully that will take a while and proceed without errors
[05:29] <airgrace> jrib: yup
[05:29] <draeath> airgrace, i would suggest doing as little as possible while that is running.
[05:29] <tuv> btw, should i be using the 386 kernel or the generic one on centrino pentium M?
[05:30] <draeath> tuv, generic (which is optimized for 686 but will work on down)
[05:30] <airgrace> draeath: yup, I've got no programs running, apart from firefox, terminal, and x-chat
[05:30] <grndslm> i just did a dist-upgrade from dapper to edgy.....and now it complains about not being able to load the i810 module and not being able to find a screen...can anybody help me?

[05:35] <loca|host> how to read/write data to parallel port (plip0)
[05:35] <cirvin_fox> sethk, i'm quite sure now that i have a bad allocation table, is there a way to rebuild the journal according to whats on the disk?
[05:39] <Vornotron> I cannot log in to my machine, and I cannot use Knoppix to mount the drive with / on it to fix it.  The primary partition says that it is of fs type "linux LVM"... but I can't figure out how to mount that.
[05:39] <grant_uae> hey guys having all kinds of problems getting ubuntu edgy to stream a quicktime file, any suggestions?

[05:43] <thevenin> are you trying to do this from the partition itself
[05:43] <thevenin> boot to a live cd then do it
[05:44] <Megaqwerty> thevenin: I don't think so, I'm doing it from /media/sda3
[05:44] <thevenin> well sorry i worded myself wrong, but still boot to a live cd
[05:44] <cirvin_fox> df -h tells me that i have 320 megs of free space on my drive, yet kdirstat says i have about 12 gigs of free space

[05:45] <spunconfuse> Hello everyone.  I'm having trouble installing an Nvidia driver in Ubuntu 6.10.  Never had trouble with ubuntu 5.04.  I have a geforce3, after I install drivers and change nv to nvidia in the xorg.conf and reboot.  I get an error.
[05:45] <spunconfuse> I'v tried every procedure I could find in the web and I'm still getting the sam errors.
[05:45] <spunconfuse> Anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong
[05:47] <Zambezi> I really need help with rsync. Can someone help me to make the transfer working?
[05:48] <Ecnassianer> My Ubuntu box has two NICs and I'm using it as a NAT (ip masq) for my windows box. It's currently working correctly, however every time I restart my Ubuntu box my windows box's net connection doesn't come back up. However, when I run Firestarter on my Ubuntu box I can grab a new IP and the NAT works again. Any idea what Firestarter is doing that brings everything back up? (Or how can I tell Firestarter to do that at bootup?)
[05:48] <draeath> Ecnassianer, firestarter is flushing your iptables rules and applying the ones you set up in it
[05:49] <grant_uae> hey guys having all kinds of problems getting ubuntu edgy to stream a quicktime file, any suggestions?
[05:49] <draeath> Ecnassianer, not sure on what you can do to automate it though (excepting replacing firestarter with a scipt)

[05:49] <honk> is ATI working with any sort of composite/beryl thing in edgy yet?
[05:49] <Ecnassianer> draeath: How would I go about replacing firestarter with a script?
[05:50] <brett> How to install a bin file?  [sorry newbie question] 
[05:50] <draeath> Ecnassianer, thats beyond me. personally I don't run a firewall on this machine
[05:51] <Ecnassianer> thanks for the info draeath
[05:51] <wasabi_> brett: Sort of depends on what the .bin file is.
[05:51] <wasabi_> brett: Just because somebody named it .bin doesn't mean anything.
[05:51] <JoshJ> uh
[05:51] <draeath> Ecnassianer, your welcome. What you are looking for is 'iptables'
[05:51] <JoshJ> .bin is a binary, those are generally what you run
[05:52] <draeath> Ecnassianer, firestarter is a fancy interface for it
[05:52] <aspro> that free formats page needs updating, as java is now, or soon to be gpl?
[05:52] <sethk> brett, as wasabi_ said, file extensions have no meaning in *nix
[05:52] <sethk> JoshJ, no, not true
[05:52] <sethk> JoshJ, a .bin can be anything
[05:52] <JoshJ> well yes
[05:52] <brett> wasabi_, well its a application I know that not an cd image  :-p
[05:52] <JoshJ> i assume the extension is matching the mimetype
[05:52] <wasabi_> brett: If it's something which needs to be run, you can mark it executable, and run it.
[05:52] <spunconfuse> anyone know why ubuntu 6.10 doesn't work with my Geforce3 when 5.04 did? :(
[05:52] <sethk> JoshJ, may not even have a mime type,
[05:52] <brett> How to run it?
[05:52] <wasabi_> brett: Or, preferabally, you can read the instructions that probably came with it.
[05:53] <JoshJ> i assume the mimetype is CORRECT :(
[05:53] <sethk> JoshJ, if it has no mime type, the mime type cannot be correct or incorrect
[05:53] <JoshJ> (as in the filename is correctly representing the (obviously existing) mimetype)
[05:53] <sethk> brett, most likely you can do:   chmod +x whatever.bin
[05:53] <JoshJ> but yes, rightclick on it and hit properties to see what it is
[05:53] <sethk> brett, then ./whatever.bin
[05:53] <sethk> JoshJ, obviously existing how?  I have 26,000 files on my system, of which maybe 30 have a mime type
[05:53] <JoshJ> uh
[05:54] <JoshJ> looks like my GUI apps have the mimetype: application/x-executable
[05:54] <JoshJ> heck even apt-cache has that
[05:55] <wasabi_> IT's worth pointing out that files do not have mime types.
[05:55] <sethk> JoshJ, your tool may fake them out that way, but they have no such type
[05:55] <wasabi_> Mime types are probed.
[05:55] <JoshJ> well that's from nautilus
[05:55] <sethk> wasabi_, correct
[05:55] <wasabi_> ie, your system guesses.
[05:55] <wasabi_> Based on what is in the file.
[05:55] <JoshJ> ah
[05:55] <brett> And what of the install path which its asking me now... what should I set that to?  is there a standard?
[05:55] <sethk> wasabi_, a mime type exists really only as part of an HTTP transaction
[05:55] <wasabi_> "if first 2 bytes = 0xDEADBEAF then file == application/x-jar", etc.
[05:55] <wasabi_> sethk: Someday maybe as an xattr if we're lucky. ;0

[06:04] <spunconfuse> I'm fairly new to linux in general.
[06:04] <sethk> spunconfuse, several possibilities.  the nvidia kernel module may not be loading
[06:04] <JoshJ> brett: i said it's in that repository, not in the regular one
[06:04] <sethk> spunconfuse, the nvidia driver may not be in the right place.
[06:05] <sethk> spunconfuse, what you should do is put on the paste web site the contents of your X log file, and tell us the URL

[06:07] <honk> ?
[06:08] <sethk> honk, I know how on kde, but not on gnome.
[06:09] <Luke> does anyone know what the ruby interpreter package is called? Everything I find is a lib for ruby
[06:09] <sethk> brett, it's different on every laptop (assuming it's a laptop)
[06:09] <honk> I'm on gnome sethk, thanks though
[06:09] <spunconfuse> sethk unless something changed once I restared gdm, I've uploaded the /var/log/Xorg.0.log, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32676/
[06:09] <feross> brett: what do you mean enable radio no IPW2200.. I have an IPW2200
[06:09] <sethk> Luke, the ruby interpreter is called .... ruby
[06:09] <darkangel_> could anyone explain me please?
[06:10] <sethk> spunconfuse, that looks perfectly normal.  You didn't get the login screen when you ran gdm?
[06:10] <Luke> sethk: ok i donno why I cant find it when searching in aptitude
[06:10] <honk> hey sethk, is there some document out there that compares the fundamental differences between kubuntu and ubuntu?
[06:10] <sethk> Luke, because the package name isn't the file name.
[06:10] <sethk> honk, there is no difference.  rather, the only difference is which desktop get's installed by default in the desktop install
[06:11] <feross> darkangel_: direct access like what to the hardware?
[06:11] <honk> I'll give it a shot sethk, thanks
[06:11] <sethk> honk, if you install from the ubuntu cd, then install kde with apt, you have exactly the same system as you would have by installing kubuntu
[06:11] <brett> feross,   well when I do  iwconfig   eth1 seems to be set ok... but I get:    eth1      radio off  ESSID:off/any
[06:11] <sethk> honk, well, if you then installed gnome from kubuntu, but you know what I mean.
[06:11] <Luke> sethk: aptitude didnt search file names last time I checked...
[06:11] <honk> ok so the only difference is the desktop
[06:11] <sethk> Luke, yes, that's what I said
[06:11] <spunconfuse> sethk  I edited xorg.conf and replace nvidia with nv, than did sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start and it came to the login screen where I entered my user and password.
[06:12] <sethk> Luke, there is a program that does find file names (apt-file)
[06:12] <Luke> sethk: ok  i have no idea what your talking about
[06:12] <sethk> spunconfuse, showing us the log file from nv isn't going to help us find out why nvidia isn't working
[06:12] <spunconfuse> if I change nv back to nvidia and stop and start gdm I will get the error.
[06:12] <sethk> spunconfuse, get the error, copy the X log file somewhere.
[06:12] <sethk> spunconfuse, I'm assuming you have to change it because your IRC client is in linux
[06:13] <spunconfuse> ok thats what I was thinking but wasn't sure.
[06:13] <feross> brett: I don't get it.. what are you trying to do. Why would you want to turn off radio on the wireless. or are you just trying to disable it.
[06:13] <sethk> spunconfuse, so cp the log file somewhere and post that one.  :)
[06:13] <spunconfuse> sethk ok I'll be back in a few minutes.  thanks.
[06:14] <grndslm> anybody here done a netboot installation before?
[06:14] <sethk> Luke, you asked about not finding ruby using a front end to apt.  I told you because ruby is a file name and the package managers don't search by file name.
[06:14] <sethk> Luke, then I told you how you can search by filename if you want to.

[06:15] <crimsun> landexem: yes, but there's no guarantee it will work
[06:15] <crimsun> landexem: there are none.
[06:15] <crimsun> landexem: you _must_ compile them yourself.

[06:24] <brett> feross  How to use this kismet.... just ype kismet in terminal?
[06:24] <spunconfuse> sethk should I search for it first?
[06:24] <airgrace> jrib: i haven't even executed "sudo apt-get dist-ugprade" the second time yet, :S
[06:24] <grndslm> sethk, it just says "TFTP open timeout"
[06:24] <grndslm> i dunno where to go from there
[06:24] <sethk> spunconfuse, yes, that will save you a reboot just to tell us.
[06:24] <jrib> airgrace: that's ok, as long as it is still doing stuff
[06:24] <airgrace> jrib: aye
[06:25] <sethk> grndslm, I would run a packet sniffer on the tftp server, and find out what is happening, whether or not the tftp server is seeing a request from the linux box.
[06:25] <Cat2> :-)
[06:25] <spunconfuse> sethk I think it found it but there are 3 lines. should I post them in here?
[06:25] <sethk> spunconfuse, I guess you can get away with three lines.  I'll get yelled at. :)  the correct thing is to use the paste site
[06:26] <airgrace> jrib: ok, i need some help now. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32680/

[06:27] <airgrace> jrib: haven't touched anyting, just let it extract.
[06:27] <jrib> airgrace: then just use the pacakge maintainer's version (you can look at the diff if you wish beforehand)
[06:27] <sethk> spunconfuse, the first line is the only one that matters.  does   uname -r   come back with 2.6.17-10?

[06:29] <airgrace> jrib: ok, i am gonna execute "http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32680/ " now, however the system is asking me to restart. should i restart first and then executed the command, or execute first and then restart?
[06:29] <dm_> sethk i got that. but its not coming up with anything

[06:30] <spunconfuse> sethk do you mean "sudo find / -name -r nvidia.ko"
[06:30] <jrib> airgrace: what is asking you to restart?
[06:30] <pedro> hello!
[06:30] <sethk> spunconfuse, you already found nvidia.ko.  I asked you a question about what uname -r shows
[06:30] <airgrace> jrib: the system, after installing the stuff.
[06:31] <dm_> sethk ah its .list not .lst
[06:31] <sethk> spunconfuse, and, no, -r isn't relevant.
[06:31] <sethk> dm_, ok, I copied the name from you, shouldn't have done that.  :)
[06:31] <jrib> airgrace: are you back at a prompt?

[06:32] <grndslm> sethk, how what's a good packet sniffer?  i've only used etherape for its aesthetic value
[06:32] <sethk> grndslm, I use ethereal

[06:33] <airgrace> jrib: ok it's done, back at prompt now.
[06:33] <dm_> sethk np thanks for helping :)
[06:33] <joe__> hi, anyone have a minute to help a noob?
[06:33] <grndslm> for some reason ethereal is installed but i can't get it to work
[06:33] <sethk> spunconfuse, ok, the module exists and it's in the correct place.
[06:33] <jrib> airgrace: k, you should be able to reboot now
[06:33] <sethk> spunconfuse, do you have a file /etc/modules ?
[06:33] <airgrace> jrib: ok, will do. brb in a min. **restarting
[06:33] <dennister> good night all...perhaps tomorrow i can find some answers...must be a very difficult problem
[06:33] <dapeeg> hi all, i just installed 5.10 on an older machine
[06:33] <sethk> spunconfuse, edit /etc/modules (use sudo), and add at the end the line:      "nvidia"
[06:34] <sethk> spunconfuse, no quotes, just nvidia
[06:34] <spunconfuse> k
[06:34] <joe__> anyone know how to open a port
[06:34] <sethk> spunconfuse, that will get the nvidia module loaded, and hopefully the nvidia driver will then work.
[06:34] <sethk> spunconfuse, at the least you'll move on to another problem.  :)
[06:34] <dapeeg> it was great....took only 30 minutes or so to install and I'm surfing the net
[06:34] <spunconfuse> :) I hope so.
[06:34] <nofxx> hi there... is there a way to take that unbelievle boring system beep when you use tab for example.... if there are more then 1 option it beeps
[06:34] <sethk> joe__, ports are usually "opened" in a router, not a workstation.  are you using ubuntu as a router?
[06:35] <nofxx> taking the system beep at all... it dosent use the mb beep but the audio card... am I right?
[06:35] <joe__> no Azureus is saying port 12769 Nat Error
[06:35] <joe__> it says to check router/firewall
[06:36] <TuTUx> joe__, ur using a router?
[06:36] <joe__> and TCP port 6880 is reserved internally, so it cannot be used.
[06:37] <joe__> yes, but I have no problem using bittorrent w/my windows machine
[06:37] <sethk> joe__, well, since it says to check router/firewall, perhaps you should check router/firewall?
=== Co_Tajir is now known as TTTFGYY
[06:37] <sethk> joe__, ok.  is iptables running?
[06:37] <nofxx> wow..heheh tought it was hard... system > admin > sounds hehe cool
[06:37] <joe__> how do I check that
[06:38] <iCod> whats the best wifi router for use with ubuntu, and cheap?
[06:38] <sethk> joe__, did you tell it during install to install a "firewall"  (I use quotes because that isn't a firewall, but the misuse is so common that I've stopped trying to fight it)
[06:38] <sethk> iCod, the access point (which is often combined into an ap and router) doesn't really make any difference at the ubuntu end
[06:39] <joe__> I dont think so.
[06:39] <sethk> iCod, the wireless hardware at the box matters, but any ap should be the same.
[06:39] <sethk> joe__, double check.    do     sudo iptables --list
[06:39] <grndslm> sethk:  i can't get ethereal to start for some reason even tho dpkg -l shows that it and ethereal-common are installed....but to make things short, the second box IS getting the ip 192.168.1.254 from the dhcp server (also tftp server)....which one comes first, i dunno
[06:39] <sethk> grndslm, dhcp is first.
[06:39] <grndslm> ok....well, it's working
[06:40] <grndslm> but tftp is not...and it does look like the client is requesting
[06:40] <grndslm> soo....now what?
[06:40] <sethk> grndslm, you just confused me.  what's working?
[06:40] <feross> brett_: hey so got it working?
[06:40] <iCod> sethk, this might sound nerdy, but what would be the easiest thing to setup my nintendo ds with? considering I only have a ubuntu pc, which I don't know if that makes a difference...
[06:40] <joe__> sethk, did it what should it say?
[06:40] <brett_> feross,  well it still saying RADIO OFF
[06:41] <sethk> iCod, all the ap's I've worked with can be configured with a web browser, and it shouldn't matter what o/s you are using to run the browser
[06:41] <PeterK> i installed NetworkMonitor with apt-get and now i can't find it, can you help?
[06:41] <feross> brett_: did sudo kismet right..
[06:41] <brett_> feross,  and scan is being done way too fast.... with nothing been found.. with KWifimanager it shows eth1 as disabled.
[06:41] <sethk> joe__, shouldn't show any rules
[06:41] <sethk> joe__, just empty chains.
[06:41] <iCod> sethk, I'm not sure what you mean...
[06:42] <grndslm> sethk: i would imagine that the servers dhcp daemon is working seeing as how the client got the ip address and displays the servers ip...and i'm assuming that the tftp client is working seeing as how etherape shows me that the tftp protocol has been used....
[06:42] <grndslm> so, i'm guessing that the tftp server is the issue

[06:42] <feross> brett_: are you trying to do it on the same laptop that you are connecting on right now? are you on wire while trying to scan on wireless?
[06:42] <grndslm> sethk: i'm guessing so
[06:42] <Pupeno> How do I set my timezone to UTC ? it's not listed on timezones on System->Administration->Time and Date.
[06:43] <sethk> grndslm, no need to guess, you looked at the packets.  the packet will tell you the source ip of the request
[06:43] <joe__> says Chain input forward output and under those just target prot opt source destination
[06:43] <brett_> brett_,   I am trying to do this all on the wired laptop that I am on at the moment..... yes?
[06:44] <sethk> joe__, right, those are just headings, and if there is nothing more, then iptables isn't your problem.
[06:44] <brett_> feross, sorry*
[06:44] <grndslm> sethk, i didn't capture any packets tho....i used etherape's pretty colors
[06:44] <iCod> sethk, alright, bye
[06:44] <sethk> grndslm, oh, ok.  if you can't get the ethereal gui going, use tcpdump
[06:44] <grndslm> aight...
[06:45] <peabodi> i'm getting an error in gnunet when i try to update software in Edgy
[06:45] <brett_> feross,  I did sudo kismet yes... it did a few things ("Enabling channel hopping." for eg)  then done.
[06:46] <PeterK> argh, what's the easy way to search for all folders named "*network*"?
[06:47] <peabodi> any ideas
[06:47] <brett_> even I have a panel "Wavlan" that for eth1 says "no such WLAN device".
[06:47] <joe__> sethk, you think I need log into my router and change a setting in there?
[06:47] <spunconfuse> sethk no go.  I tried everything you said and I'm still getting the same error.
[06:48] <feross> brett_: ok... something is messing it up. I would comment out my whole /etc/network/interfaces except for the lo interface... clear the profiles.xml that gnome-nm-applet makes and install network-manager.. then restart and disable wireless through the network-manager task-tray icon and try kismet again. that's how I currently have it setup.
[06:49] <peabodi> hmmm no ideas huh?
[06:49] <CarlFK> "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" - where is it?
[06:51] <grndslm> sethk:  i'm guessing this means failed tftp server....am i supposed to add that to inetd.conf?

[06:54] <landexem> Is it bad to install Debian's ALSA packages onto Edgy?
[06:54] <defrysk> yes
[06:55] <landexem> Well how can I get the newest ALSA packages for Ubuntu?
[06:55] <defrysk> why do you need them ?
[06:55] <landexem> Are there precompiled 1.0.13 Ubuntu packages?
[06:56] <halex-ab> Why do you need them?
[06:56] <landexem> I need to upgrade ALSA to get sound out of the speakers on a MacBook Pro
[06:56] <halex-ab> Ah..
[06:56] <landexem> I figured because Ubuntu didn't have 1.0.13 ALSA packages and Debian did, I'd just get those .debs
[06:56] <feross> brett_: oh, well if you're using xubuntu I don't think the gnome-nm-applet is enabled by default right...
[06:56] <halex-ab> Well, to tell you thruth, there shouldn't much that could happen..
[06:57] <brett_> feross,   yes I dont think so.
[06:57] <halex-ab> Just understand it's probably safer to go with compiling from source then use Debian's packages..
[06:57] <feross> brett_: so go ahead and install network-manager and go from there.. you could try to restart udev to get network-manager going or just quick reboot.
[06:58] <brett_> feross, any ideas about my earlier question about using having KDE session as opposed to Xfce or gnome?   I mean how to switch between these just via login manager?
[06:59] <defrysk> landexem, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBook might be of some help
[06:59] <feross> brett_: yeah, if you apt-get install kde-desktop or something like that... you'll be able to switch between the desktops from the login
[06:59] <brett_> feross, BTW I already have network-manager installed from before.
[07:00] <feross> ok does it show up in a task tray or anything?
[07:00] <feross> you need to disable wireless
[07:00] <landexem> defrysk: Yeah it says to use ALSA 1.0.13
[07:00] <Lovloss> For some reason i keep getting "gnunet" errors
[07:00] <Lovloss> when i install stuff too
[07:00] <feross> brett_: did you comment out your interfaces file? everything in there except the lo device
[07:00] <link_36p> Does anyone know of a method in GTK or mono that returns the users home directory?
[07:01] <brett_> feross, yes I did... I think I should restart once though?
[07:01] <Lovloss> oh, is it because i never installed gnunet?
[07:01] <cyber> waz up
[07:01] <brett_> feross, I left iface & eh0 though or else I will not have net access?
[07:02] <feross> brett_: yes or just /etc/inet.d/networking restart .. but it wouldn't hurt if you just want to restart.
[07:02] <Lovloss> see WTH "dependency problems"
[07:02] <feross> brett_: you have to manage those through network manager..
[07:02] <untung> hi, i have ubuntu on 6GB hd, how do i make disk image of it?
[07:02] <feross> untung: try partimage.. or just  dd ..

[07:03] <untung> ferros: can i restore the hd image into larger hd?
[07:04] <halex-ab> link_36p, please use the #mono channel on GimpNet next time.. ;)
[07:04] <Lovloss> What's this mean: "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[07:04] <Lovloss> that keeps happening
[07:04] <halex-ab> Lovloss, means (probably) that the deb has configuration issues..
[07:04] <halex-ab> Normally a bad config script

[07:05] <Lovloss> any way to fix that? i keep geting that when i install it
[07:05] <feross> untung: I have not used partimage but it's a ghost clone which means yes you should be able to.. with dd you can also but you'll have a 6GB partition and then blank space which you can use for anything else.

[07:11] <Lovloss> gnunet in general
[07:11] <halex-ab> Lovloss, the package maintainer didn't notice it.. ;)
[07:11] <halex-ab> Lovloss, You'll need to post a bug report (if it doesn't already exist) on launchpad.net, if it doesn't already exist..
[07:11] <halex-ab> If it does, just comment and say it doesn't work for you.. :0
[07:11] <halex-ab> ;)
[07:11] <Lovloss> :(
[07:11] <defrysk> aptitude remove <thebrokenpackage>
[07:11] <Lovloss> so now i cant use Wine and stuff?
[07:12] <defrysk> sudo aptitude remove <thebrokenpackage>
[07:12] <Lovloss> whats the broken package?
[07:12] <halex-ab> Lovloss, as defrysk said, you just need to remove that offending package (gnunet)..
[07:12] <Lovloss> aha
[07:12] <halex-ab> Then you should be able to use apt-get normally..
[07:12] <ragamuffin> Are line numbers required for /etc/hosts file?
[07:12] <defrysk> Lovloss, in this case use aptitude
[07:12] <halex-ab> ragamuffin, No..
[07:12] <defrysk> iso apt-get
[07:13] <Lovloss> got it
[07:13] <ragamuffin> Third line is blank?
[07:13] <Lovloss> thanks! yay!! :D
[07:13] <defrysk> ;)
[07:13] <sethk> ragamuffin, no
[07:13] <sethk> ragamuffin, if you were to put line numbers in it, it wouldn't work
[07:13] <ragamuffin> But I have the third line blank
[07:14] <Lovloss> you guys rule thanks
[07:14] <defrysk> Lovloss, only use aptitude in case of emergencies , it has unexpected powers
[07:14] <Lovloss> it says it has "super cow powers"
[07:14] <sethk> ragamuffin, blank lines don't hurt anything
[07:14] <ragamuffin> !pastebin
[07:14] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:14] <defrysk> Lovloss, supercows have sharp horns ;)
[07:14] <halex-ab> Lovloss, haha, try apt-get moo
[07:14] <halex-ab> :)
[07:14] <Lovloss> reminds me of diablo
[07:14] <nofxx_> how to install the java plugin on ff 2.0 ?  or a better client for VNC... the scrollbars dont work on vncviewer
[07:14] <Lovloss> LOL
[07:15] <mikm[laptop] > Lovloss- now try aptitude moo
[07:15] <mikm[laptop] > Then do aptitude -v moo
[07:15] <halex-ab> mikm[laptop] , lmao
[07:15] <mikm[laptop] > Add another v and do it again
[07:15] <link_36p> halex-ab: Is there a work around to removing a package that gives errors when doing "apt-get remove package"
[07:15] <mikm[laptop] > I forget how many 'v's it goes up to :)
[07:15] <brett> feross,   thanks it seems to be good now  :-D
[07:15] <feross> brett: cool
[07:15] <Lovloss> brilliant
[07:16] <Lovloss> i love linux
[07:16] <defrysk> link_36p, try removing it with aptitude
[07:16] <halex-ab> link_36p, not until the package is fixed..
[07:16] <halex-ab> Sorry, I mis-read..
[07:16] <halex-ab> Go with defrysk.. ;)
[07:16] <defrysk> link_36p, aptitude remove <package>
[07:16] <modified54> whats the easiest way to find out what kind of wireless card is in my laptop?
[07:16] <brett> So if I get kde-desktop then I can switch between this or any other session from login?
[07:16] <defrysk> brett, yes
[07:16] <link_36p> defrysk: same error
[07:16] <Ecnassianer_> sethk: That works. Thanks for the progress. But is this the "proper" way to do things, or should I keep looking for a more permanant solution?
[07:16] <brett> modified54, check on google or your manuf. site
[07:17] <feross> modified54: tried lspci
[07:17] <defrysk> link_36p, oooh
[07:17] <brett> modified54,   yeah lspci is best  :-D
[07:17] <defrysk> link_36p, aptitude -f install
[07:17] <sethk> Ecnassianer_, it's not improper exactly.  it's really up to you whether to keep looking.  personally, I'd declare victor.
[07:17] <sethk> victory
[07:17] <defrysk> link_36p,sudo aptitude -f install
[07:18] <defrysk> even
[07:18] <brett> What about the splash image.... is there any mod's out there?  or how can I modify this?  I dont like that of any of the Ubuntu distributions  :-p
[07:18] <Ecnassianer_> hmm, it seems like a good idea for my firewall to come up a little closer to my networks coming up... but it is tempting to declare victory :)
[07:19] <sethk> Ecnassianer_, if you fix it, it might come up a bit earlier, but only a bit.
[07:19] <feross> brett: not sure about xubuntu but in gnome there's a ligin manager that you can change all of that stuff in.
[07:20] <Ecnassianer_> Well, I'll give it a few more minutes of investigation and then be happy with whatever I get ;)
[07:20] <defrysk> xubuntu also uses gdm
[07:20] <Ecnassianer_> Thanks for your help
[07:20] <brett> feross, but I am talking about pre-X Desktop Manager/ Window Manager enviroment
[07:21] <SpaceFrog> I have a strange question.. Is there a program out there that I can download and play a tune out the PC Speaker (like beep, but rather than a beep a song instead). I want to play it remotely so i need to do it through SSH.
[07:21] <Ecnassianer_> SpaceFrog: I've never thought of it before, but that sounds like a fun toy :D
[07:21] <JoshJ> uh
[07:21] <JoshJ> lemme make sure i understand you
[07:22] <Skwid_> ahhh
[07:22] <JoshJ> you want to ssh into someone else's system and use a program on your system to play a sound file on their system and have it come out your speakers?
[07:22] <Skwid_> has anyone gotten the nice firefox forms to work in firefox 2 ?
[07:22] <SpaceFrog> it's my system
[07:22] <sunganes> hi! i now have installed ubuntu edgy with java jdk and eclipse. I would like to install jboss and hibernate. do we have debian pkgs for these?

[07:23] <Stephenishere> Hi
[07:23] <Skwid_> also, where can i change the language of installation ?
[07:23] <feross> brett: hmm. I'm sure you can do it through command prompt. prolly somewhere like gdm config file.

[07:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alsamixer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:24] <DBO> mwhite, here for help or community? =)
[07:24] <Rookie_> synaptic, apt-get, adept are progs to use to install or remove with

[07:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about layout - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:24] <mwhite> kind of both.

[07:25] <mwhite> sweet thanks! this is awesome
[07:25] <Stephenishere> i cant resize windows or move windows
[07:25] <Rookie_> Stephenishere - you have backup files in /etc/X11
[07:26] <mwhite> I've tried other versions of Linux but none of them had this kind of support
[07:26] <ragamuffin> Now that i have dual boot with XP, how can I choose XP's os selection menu at the booting?
[07:26] <DBO> Stephenishere, sudo mv /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-cusom /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom.xgl
[07:26] <DBO> Stephenishere, then, sudo apt-get install --reinstall gdm

[07:27] <rad|x> i keept getting 'No rule to make target `arch/i386/kernel/msr.c' when i try to compile my module
[07:27] <mwhite> Ubuntu does not use rpms correct?
[07:27] <Rookie_> !alien
[07:27] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[07:27] <DBO> mwhite, thats right
[07:27] <DBO> mwhite, ubuntus uses debs, which are a lot like rpms
[07:28] <ncstoneman> What is the thought on linuxmint ?
[07:28] <mwhite> thank you
[07:29] <mwhite> so if I want to configure Java on Firefox so I can view applets I need to first download Java?
[07:29] <mwhite> and get a deb
[07:29] <Skwid_> anybody know how i can get my firefox res folder back ?
[07:30] <mwhite> sorry Skwid I don't know..I'm new to Ubuntu
[07:31] <DBO> mwhite, its easier than that
[07:31] <DBO> !java
[07:31] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[07:31] <Jasey> hi there, anyone know how i can disable the fsck check when booting? thank you in advance.
[07:31] <xpoint> when i "sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp" ubuntu will install lilo even its booted with grub working ?, how can i just install the smp kernel without change grub as boot loader ?
[07:32] <mwhite> so there is an easy button on Ubuntu? :)
[07:32] <ragamuffin> !mount
[07:32] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[07:32] <DBO> mwhite, you got it =)
[07:32] <mwhite> hehe
[07:32] <tbtrojanek> mwhite: that's what all the configuration tools are for.

[07:33] <DBO> mwhite, just look at the link ubotu posted
[07:33] <mwhite> kk
[07:33] <DBO> or if you want we can go into a private chat (here is rather busy) and I can walk you through it all
[07:33] <Vornotron> ...my server appears to have forgotten how to log in.

[07:34] <Skwid_> please :)
[07:35] <ncstoneman> has anyone used http://lt.k1011.nutime.de/ ?
[07:36] <DBO> Skwid_, you can get a version of that file simply be reinstalling the deb it came in
[07:36] <weex> is there some issue using beryl/AIGLX with dapper and S3 savage?
[07:37] <DBO> weex, yeah it doesnt work

[07:39] <Vornotron> My recovery console is broken; I can no longer log in.  How do I fix this?
[07:39] <Jasey> hi there, anyone know how i can disable the fsck check when booting? thank you in advance.:)
[07:39] <Vornotron> rather - unlike before, where the recovery console would automatically log me in as root, it now asks for a login.  And the root password doesn't work.
[07:40] <kapputu> I cannot get any sound with my mpg movies. I'm able to listen to mp3s etc
[07:40] <kapputu> what codecs do I need?
[07:40] <Rookie_> Vornotron - try a user and then sudo
[07:41] <Rookie_> libxine-extracodecs
[07:41] <Vornotron> I have; none of the users seem to work.
[07:41] <kapputu> Rookie_: I have that
[07:41] <valehru_server> how can i ensure that a package has been uninstalled and then flushed from memory before installing it again?
[07:42] <Rookie_> Vornotron - means that all of your users are gone ... ? and you cant access the system ... ? sounds wierd
[07:42] <talkIRC> hello all i'm looking for some help with a modem driver and didn't know where to start
[07:42] <kapputu> strange, if I just forward the video by a few seconds, I get the sound
[07:43] <Vornotron> Rookie_: I would be more surprised by this if my predecessor hadn't used LDAP for the majority of users.
[07:43] <zipzo> can anyone help me rebuild my libSDL, enabling ALSA.
[07:43] <Rookie_> kapputu - can it be an codeec for the films ... ? they are in a code that is not out yet for linux ... ?
[07:43] <Vornotron> ...which uses BDB.  ...which fucks up when there's a power failure.
[07:44] <nalioth> Vornotron: language please
[07:44] <xabbott> I think I uninstalled the basic "add/remove" thing.... is that ok? I mostly use Synap and apt-get... I'm using 6.10
[07:44] <Vornotron> I have fiddled with /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd and /etc/nsswitch so that root has a password there and that it gets looked at, but no such luck.
[07:44] <Vornotron> nalioth: sorry
[07:44] <Rookie_> not for a think it will work but, try a livecd and see if you can create a user .... but i dont think that is possible
[07:45] <Rookie_> otherwise, i cant see anything else then start from the begining ...
[07:45] <vnux> hi, how can I change my keyboard layout under xubuntu?
[07:45] <talkIRC> can anyone help me with a modem driver
[07:45] <matthew_> yes
[07:45] <Rookie_> !modem
[07:45] <ubotu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[07:46] <sethk> Vornotron, you've set the root password and it was wlrking before you got into this mess?
[07:46] <zipzo> ok.....anyone know how to rebuild the libSDL to enable ALSA
[07:46] <sethk> Vornotron, you said that, sorry.  by the way all you needed to do is:    sudo passwd
[07:46] <Vornotron> sethk: that assumes I can get a shell prompt.
[07:46] <Vornotron> I can't get past the login prompt.
[07:47] <talkIRC> thx for the wiki but i don't think 6.06 has a driver for the modem i'm using, is there any way to find out for sure?
[07:47] <Rookie_> sethk - he cant login with any user at all
[07:47] <vnux> I don't have the system--prefernces--keyboard as stated on some websites

[07:48] <Epimorphic> can anyone help set up PPPOA dsl? got WAG45G Linksys router
[07:48] <sethk> Rookie_, sounds like he corrupted his passwd/shadow files.  boot the live cd and reset them
[07:48] <brett> Anyone know any place to get games?
[07:49] <zipzo> ok.....anyone know how to rebuild the libSDL to enable ALSA
[07:49] <crimsun> zipzo: it already is enabled and is included by default.
[07:49] <brett> I looked via Synaptic but not many games listed therein  :-(
[07:49] <Vornotron> I do not have a liveCD for, uh, breezy, I think it is.
[07:49] <Rookie_> sethk - yes, by a fault on halt, disks went down on a wrong way and the files got corrupted ...
[07:49] <zipzo> im having alot of problem with sound
[07:50] <Vornotron> Rookie_: I don't think any of the passwords were stored in passwd/shadow; when I looked at the shadow file the password crypt was still listed as "*"
[07:50] <Epimorphic> need help with dsl connection
[07:51] <Vornotron> They were therefore most likely in LDAP.
[07:51] <zipzo> when i tell ppl im having problems with sound, they tell my try a diff distro other than ubuntu
[07:51] <Vornotron> Which leaves me with BDB screwing up.
[07:51] <klees> is there any way i can have rendering on with beryl and a ATI 9800??

[07:52] <Halpo> how do you get java working in linux??
[07:52] <Skwid_> any way to change the system language after install ?
[07:52] <zipzo> basically i think my problems stem from applications trying to use my motherboard sound
[07:53] <st4hl> hi, how do i install kernel sources/headers and all tools necessary for compilation properly? I am using 6.06.
[07:53] <squarepusher> Can anyone help me understand why my soundcard buzzes constantly?
[07:53] <Halpo> my situation...I'm opening a web page in firefox that needs a missing java plugin the JRE....so i got ot the sun site and follow their instructions but it doesnt register in firefox
[07:53] <Vornotron> But LDAP didn't want to come back up, and is spewing dozens of "oh noes I can't talk to ldap" messages, and putting a crypt()'d password into shadow or passwd isn't helping
[07:53] <squarepusher> "lspci|grep -i sound" yields Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  AC'97 Sound Controller

[08:09] <zipzo> nothing changed
[08:09] <crimsun> zipzo: you haven't done anything yet
[08:10] <zipzo> hehe :) didnt think so
[08:10] <crimsun> zipzo: rm ~/.asoundrc*
[08:10] <crimsun> zipzo: wget http://www.trilug.org/~crimsun/asoundconf
[08:10] <crimsun> zipzo: python ./asoundconf set-default-card Live
[08:10] <loca|host> i have a fresh ubuntu install that wont me do any sudo command saying: sudo: Unable to lookup elkok-laptop via gethostbyname()
[08:10] <loca|host> i cant vi my /etc/hosts
[08:11] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know what command is needed to determine which package an installed file came from ?
[08:11] <zipzo> all done
[08:11] <crimsun> zipzo: now try an SDL app
[08:11] <roryy> loca|host: as far as I know you need to boot into rescue mode, fix up the hostname, and then switch back to normal mode
[08:12] <zipzo> nope, no sounds
[08:12] <crimsun> zipzo: what's the error that SDL actually displays?
[08:12] <roryy> loca|host: I think the main thing is whatever is in /etc/hostname must be an entry in /etc/hosts, pointing to 127.0.0.1
[08:12] <zipzo> i dont see an error
[08:13] <xabbott> Anyone know what I have to delete to remove all settings/saved info from firefox? I've tried deleting .mozilla folder and it still retains my old settings.
[08:13] <crimsun> zipzo: can you switch speaker outputs and see if sounds are being output to your onboard?
[08:13] <Zambezi> Anyone know what gam_server is? The load is 30% atm.
[08:14] <zipzo> i have sound on alot of things, i can play music
[08:15] <zipzo> i dont know how to change output though
[08:15] <crimsun> zipzo: yes, we need to establish whether you compiled SDL with alsa support
[08:15] <crimsun> zipzo: well, you, um, physically plug the speakers into the onboard's output...
[08:15] <zipzo> oh that
[08:15] <zipzo> i guess lemme try that one
[08:16] <talkIRC> ok i've read alot but still have no idea why i can't get this smartlink 1800 pci modem to read
[08:17] <talkIRC> could i set up a direct connection to my windows nic and use the dial up from it to try to post the problem to ubuntu servers for help?
[08:17] <pibarnas> is it possible to change gnome burning options (considering it uses mkisofs and cdrecord) with some gnome tool? maybe gconf-editor??
=== cari_tmen_ce is now known as ^AZIS^
[08:18] <talkIRC> or am i just wasting my time trying to get online with it until broadband is an option in my area in 2009?
[08:19] <talkIRC> dial-up is my only option
[08:19] <rickyfingers> talkIRC: sattelite
[08:19] <rickyfingers> *satellite
[08:20] <talkIRC> 100 US dollars a month for the cheepest one i can find, that's just too far out of my price range
[08:20] <david_> Crimsun: this is Zipzo...i have sound on the motherboard output.
[08:20] <crimsun> david_: ding.
[08:21] <crimsun> david_: now, while the SDL app is running, pastebin the output from ``lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*''
[08:21] <talkIRC> so the bottem line is that i'm pretty well "s.o.l." if all i can use is dial-up
[08:21] <JoshJ> !dialup
[08:21] <ubotu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[08:22] <talkIRC> read that, didn't help me any, didn't even offer my modem chipset anywhere with all that
[08:23] <david_> ummm i cant! i cant alt+tab out of eithe rone of the 2 apps
[08:23] <talkIRC> and i have like 3 conexant modems but i'm trying to use linux to get away from paying for software, drivers, ect.  ; the only place to get drivers for those modems wants to charge you for them, and i can't see doing that with something that's open sorce
[08:23] <roryy> talkIRC: have you downloaded and run the 'scanModem' script ?
[08:23] <squarepusher> :q
[08:23] <squarepusher> \exit
[08:23] <ZeeO> hey guys how big is all of ubuntus package system if i was to mirror it at home
[08:23] <ZeeO> so my installs are faster
[08:23] <ZeeO> over lan
[08:24] <crimsun> 70 GB.
[08:24] <roryy> *choke*
[08:24] <roryy> really?
[08:24] <ZeeO> how do i go about
[08:24] <crimsun> that was breezy
[08:24] <ZeeO> geting it
[08:24] <crimsun> it's likely much larger
[08:24] <roryy> for 1 architecture/release, surely on the order of 10 GB though?
[08:24] <ZeeO> can i get mirror software?
[08:24] <JoshJ> uh
[08:24] <JoshJ> o_O
[08:24] <david_> crimsun: i cant do that because i cant alt+tab out of the apps
[08:24] <JoshJ> i'm fairly sure you could
[08:24] <talkIRC> put it on a jump drive but the system froze when i tried to run it (i think i did it right)
[08:25] <crimsun> david_: can you start it in windowed mode?
[08:25] <JoshJ> but i doubt anyone would use your mirror...
[08:25] <roryy> talkIRC: hmm, ok, that's not good
[08:25] <talkIRC> i know
[08:25] <ZeeO> i'm not opening it
[08:25] <david_> i tried, but the mouse couldtn escape
[08:25] <ZeeO> for ppl
[08:25] <ZeeO> itd be so my installs
[08:25] <ZeeO> are fast
[08:25] <ZeeO> over my lan
[08:25] <ZeeO> is what i'm thinking
[08:25] <JoshJ> i have no idea... might want to ask one of the packagers
[08:25] <talkIRC> took me 3 different boxes before i got one that would run this distro
[08:25] <JoshJ> but you'd have to download them every time the repo's updated
[08:25] <ZeeO> what distro?
[08:25] <ZeeO> ubuntu
[08:25] <ZeeO> ?
[08:25] <talkIRC> yrp
[08:25] <talkIRC> oopd
[08:25] <ZeeO> i never had probs ever
[08:26] <talkIRC> yep
[08:26] <ZeeO> with geting it to run
[08:26] <roryy> !enter | ZeeO
[08:26] <ubotu> ZeeO: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[08:26] <david_> neverwinter nights i cant run in windowed
[08:26] <david_> darwinia would let the mouse escape the window box
[08:26] <ZeeO> yaa yaa you guys aways say that to me
[08:26] <talkIRC> one was a kernal sync error, another was optical failure
[08:26] <ZeeO> i like my enter key:P
[08:26] <talkIRC> and then bang i got it to work on an old pent 533 celron
[08:26] <roryy> talkIRC: if scanModem crashes, I'd recommend mailing the linmodem mailing list
[08:27] <crimsun> david_: so try with darwinia
[08:27] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know where the /usr/bin/lpr comes from on Ubuntu ?
[08:27] <JoshJ> !lpr
[08:27] <ubotu> lpr: BSD lpr/lpd line printer spooling system. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:2005.05.01 (edgy), package size 111 kB, installed size 404 kB
[08:28] <roryy> Samus_Aran: you can run 'dpkg -S /usr/bin/lpr' to find out
[08:28] <talkIRC> thanks roryy, i think i have a modem driver for the modem but i can't get it installed, i have no idea how, and not only that but it's not like windows, just double click and fallow the instructions
[08:28] <Samus_Aran> roryy: it says not found
[08:28] <david_> crimsun: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/827915
[08:28] <roryy> Samus_Aran: on my system, it's cupsys-bsd
[08:28] <Samus_Aran> /usr/bin/lpr is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/lpr which is a symlink to /usr/local/linuxprinter/bin/llpr .. which is also not found
[08:28] <JoshJ> ...haha wtf
[08:28] <JoshJ> GNU/linux: Even after 20 years, printers are still a problem
[08:28] <ZeeO> hmm apt-mirror
[08:28] <crimsun> david_: brilliant, just as I suspected. Your SDL recompile failed.
[08:28] <aru> !restricted
[08:28] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[08:29] <crimsun> david_: you didn't compile SDL with alsa support.
[08:29] <roryy> Samus_Aran: hmm.  stuff in /usr/local is usually something you installed from source
[08:29] <talkIRC> roryy: i'll try scanmodem again and see what happens, maybe i messed it up somewhere
[08:29] <david_> of course! (lost)
[08:29] <MikeyMike> can ubuntu dapper use debian 3+ packages? or should i use 2.1?
[08:29] <david_> isnt that what i said? :P
[08:29] <roryy> talkIRC: hmm. maybe
[08:29] <JoshJ> i think the policy on debian packages is NO
[08:29] <JoshJ> !debian
[08:29] <ubotu> Debian is "the rock upon which Ubuntu is founded". To see more details on the relationship, see: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[08:29] <JoshJ> ...bleh
[08:29] <crimsun> david_: well, essentially why are you trying to recompile SDL with alsa support? It _comes_ with ALSA support.
[08:29] <MikeyMike> i use debian packages
[08:29] <roryy> talkIRC: unfortunately, these win modems are a major pain.  I have one myself
[08:29] <MikeyMike> they work?
[08:29] <JoshJ> well
[08:29] <JoshJ> !worksforme
[08:29] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[08:29] <Samus_Aran> roryy: I am using CUPS here, it is working fine.  I am actually studying for a Linux cert exam, and wanting to learn more about which printing apps are using which tools .. but then I can't identify where that one is even coming from
[08:29] <roryy> talkIRC: it makes every kernel upgrade and adventure!
[08:30] <Samus_Aran> dpkg -S /usr/bin/lpr just returns a not found error
[08:30] <MikeyMike> what the hell does latest version have to do with what i said
[08:30] <david_> isnt that now what we need to do tho?
[08:30] <MikeyMike> you moron
[08:30] <MikeyMike> lol
[08:30] <JoshJ> ...
[08:30] <talkIRC> i bet it does, does your modem work?
[08:30] <JoshJ> read the whole thing
[08:30] <JoshJ> "Works for me" does not mean it is ok.
[08:30] <MikeyMike> good grief
[08:30] <crimsun> david_: no.
[08:30] <david_> oh :)
[08:30] <crimsun> david_: #1. Remove your self-compiled SDL.
[08:30] <JoshJ> i'm fairly sure the policy here is "you're on your own if you do anything that's not in the official repos"
[08:30] <Samus_Aran> talkIRC: I read that as "does your mom work?", heh.
[08:30] <david_> i didnt self-compile anything
[08:30] <MikeyMike> dude control yourself seriously
[08:30] <crimsun> david_: #2. Reinstall libsdl1.2debian-alsa
[08:30] <JoshJ> which definitely includes debian stuff
[08:30] <MikeyMike> good grief
[08:31] <david_> i dont know how to remove it
[08:31] <MikeyMike> bbl
[08:31] <JoshJ> i know i asked seveas about it earlier and he said it's a bad idea
[08:31] <talkIRC> funny
[08:31] <crimsun> david_: then just do this: ``sudo apt-get --reinstall install libsdl1.2debian-alsa''
[08:31] <talkIRC> where i'm at in the world it's dial up or nothing, at least till 2009 when very slow dsl might be in my area
[08:32] <roryy> Samus_Aran: hmm. you can probably use 'update-alternatives' to make that link point somewhere useful.  My /usr/bin/lpr, on Ubuntu 6.10, is not a symlink, fwiw
[08:32] <talkIRC> it takes me 30 minutes driving to find a fast food restraunt
[08:32] <roryy> talkIRC: yes, it does.  I have an intel 536ep
[08:32] <david_> ok then what?
[08:32] <defrysk> talkIRC, that means you are unlikely to be obese , so lucky you ;)
[08:32] <crimsun> david_: then plug the speakers back into your audigy, and restart your SDL app
[08:32] <talkIRC> lol
[08:33] <Samus_Aran> roryy: hm.  I haven't done anything manually to my print system.  I used a fresh install of 6.06
[08:33] <talkIRC> lucky to weight more then 145 LB (i think that's like 70 Kg)
[08:33] <Samus_Aran> roryy: not sure why mine's b0rked =)
[08:33] <david_> did it, doesnt work, wound is still coming out of motherboard
[08:33] <david_> *sound
[08:34] <aru> is it different to add repositories in 6.10?
[08:34] <defrysk> 2LBs = .8 kilo's
[08:34] <eobanb> aru, no
[08:34] <crimsun> david_: so it's still using /dev/dsp according to the lsof output?
=== talkIRC is now known as talkIRC-afk
[08:34] <david_> i dunno
[08:34] <aru> eobanb: then why cant I find an add button?
[08:34] <crimsun> david_: then check the lsof output
[08:35] <david_> so i typed lsof in a terminal and got many pages of stuff
[08:35] <eobanb> aru, settings menu.
[08:35] <crimsun> david_: use the lsof command I gave you above
[08:35] <david_> and..its still going
[08:36] <david_> COMMAND    PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
[08:36] <david_> mixer_app 5069 david   36u   CHR  116,0      8845 /dev/snd/controlC0
[08:36] <aru> eobanb: yeah I got that part, but its different, there isnt an add button anywhere
[08:36] <david_> sorry for being green
[08:36] <crimsun> david_: is the SDL app closed now or what?
[08:37] <david_> sorry, lemme redo that
[08:37] <david_> david@david-desktop:~$ COMMAND    PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
[08:37] <david_> bash: COMMAND: command not found

[08:37] <david_> bash: mixer_app: command not found
[08:38] <crimsun> david_: ...? I mean that you should restart your SDL app.
[08:38] <david_> i did
[08:38] <david_> it running
[08:38] <klerfayt> what I need to extract rpm
[08:38] <crimsun> david_: now run the whole lsof command
[08:38] <crimsun> david_: and use pastebin, please; don't paste here
[08:38] <defrysk> klerfayt, a src-rpm
[08:39] <klerfayt> defrysk: whar do you mean?
[08:39] <defrysk> a source rpm
[08:40] <y3it221_klce> real player not working with me...........can anyone help me
[08:40] <y3it221_klce> i use Ubuntu Edgy
[08:40] <klerfayt> defrysk: so I can look inside rpm?
[08:40] <crimsun> y3it221_klce: are you using realplay from dapper-commercial ?
[08:40] <defrysk> rpmbuild --rebuild blah.src-rpm
[08:40] <y3it221_klce> crimsun, i downloaded it from real.com/linux
[08:40] <defrysk> it rebuilds it extract it and more
[08:41] <crimsun> y3it221_klce: what error do you get?
[08:41] <y3it221_klce> crimsun, it used to work sometimes
[08:41] <defrysk> it even gives a specfile sources and a rebuild rpm
[08:41] <y3it221_klce> but not this time
[08:41] <defrysk> klerfayt, go to rpm.org for more info
[08:42] <y3it221_klce> crimsun, i dont get any error........it even plays the file but not in normal way.......it plays with difference is speed.........it looks like its playing in the fast foreward mode
[08:43] <klerfayt> defrysk: isn't rpm like deb; can't I just extract it like deb?
[08:43] <zipzo> crimsun:

[08:43] <defrysk> klerfayt, its an rpm , not a .deb
[08:43] <crimsun> zipzo: right, so the libSDL being used isn't the official Ubuntu one
[08:43] <defrysk> klerfayt, sudo apt-get install rpm , and man rpm
[08:43] <zipzo> hmmm
[08:43] <floating> Hallou. If I have add/remove added a program, and then removed it. Do I need an internet connection to add it again ?
[08:44] <zipzo> how did that happen?
[08:44] <crimsun> zipzo: did you add any non-Ubuntu repositories? Did you recompile SDL?
[08:44] <defrysk> klerfayt, and do use rpm to install packages on ubuntu
[08:44] <zipzo> i didnt recompile sdl
[08:44] <zipzo> all i added that wasnt ubuntu was automatix and the multiverse
[08:45] <crimsun> oh my.
[08:45] <defrysk> zipzo, you silly
[08:45] <crimsun> what in the world does automatix add these days?
[08:45] <defrysk> stay away from automatix
[08:45] <zipzo> stuff that made it work
[08:45] <floating> If I have installed a program with sudo dpkg -i xxx.deb ,how do I remove it ?
[08:45] <zipzo> why? without automatix. NOTHING worked
[08:45] <defrysk> zipzo, and broke the rest ?
[08:46] <zipzo> no automatix and i had allmost no reason to run linux. nothing worked at all really
[08:46] <roryy> floating:   'apt-get remove xxx' ought to do it.
[08:46] <defrysk> zipzo, automatix is not supported here
[08:46] <talkIRC-afk> roryy: i got scanmodem to run this time.....
[08:46] <floating> okitx
[08:46] <roryy> talkIRC-afk: ah-ha. does it tell you anything useful?
[08:47] <zipzo> oh so....im not asking for automatix support
[08:47] <sky123> yakshamesh
[08:47] <zipzo> my original question...could someone help me rebuild libSDL
[08:47] <defrysk> zipzo, go to #automatix and find out there why you have probs
[08:47] <zipzo> listen. just stop
[08:47] <crimsun> zipzo: find /usr -name '*libSDL-1.2.so.*'
[08:47] <talkIRC-afk> being new to linux not really, told me something i already kenw, that it's a smartlink chipset modem
[08:48] <crimsun> zipzo: dude, I'm _trying_ to help you, but recompiling SDL is _not_ what you need to do.
[08:48] <roryy> talkIRC-afk: it *should* point you to a driver, though
[08:48] <zipzo> oh i know you are helpind
[08:48] <CorpseFeeder> what's that web page for automatically generating list of repositories to paste into sources.list
=== charles__ is now known as cwek_asmara
[08:48] <defrysk> klerfayt, dont private me
[08:48] <zipzo> defrysk is basically asking me to leave
[08:48] <talkIRC-afk> would that be in one of the output files?
[08:48] <defrysk> no
=== talkIRC-afk is now known as talkIRC
[08:48] <defrysk> zipzo, listen to crimsun
[08:48] <roryy> talkIRC: it should be
[08:48] <zipzo> i am, thnx
[08:48] <roryy> talkIRC: offhand, I can't remember which one
[08:49] <talkIRC> ok i'll go read them all and then tell you which one actualy sounded helpful, lol
[08:49] <roryy> talkIRC: although it's very thorough, i do find scanModem's output to be a little verbose
[08:49] <zipzo> im not sking for automatix support, and if its bad i dont need it. howver lots of newbs to ubuntu can read all over the internet how you need automatix
[08:49] <talkIRC> roryy: any help is better then none
[08:49] <defrysk> !automatix | zipzo
[08:49] <ubotu> zipzo: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
=== talkIRC is now known as talkIRC-afk
[08:50] <zipzo> well now i know
[08:50] <zipzo> however, it did add alot of stuff that actually made the computer useful
[08:50] <defrysk> zipzo, nuff said
[08:51] <zipzo> crimsun: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/827917
[08:51] <defrysk> zipzo, crimson is trying to help you so stay on topic
[08:51] <zipzo> ok thanx, we been at it a while now
[08:51] <crimsun> oh, wow, darwinia includes its own SDL
=== llindy is now known as lindy
[08:51] <crimsun> well no wonder then.
[08:52] <crimsun> man, that's horrid
[08:52] <zipzo> well ok, but its not just darwinia
[08:52] <zipzo> i just want out of the mess
[08:52] <sky123> anyone familiar with Ubuntu on Sparc??
[08:52] <tonyyarusso> !away | lindy
[08:52] <ubotu> lindy: Please don't use public away messages or change your nick to 'someone|away'.  We know you're away when you don't respond to messages. Also see !guidelines
[08:52] <zipzo> same with neverwinter nights, which i do believe has a long history of linux use
[08:53] <crimsun> zipzo: ok, you need to switch the default order of the cards, and it's as simple as executing this following command and then rebooting:  echo options snd-intel8x0 index=-2 |sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[08:53] <crimsun> zipzo: after that, sound should work everywhere.
[08:53] <zipzo> ok, drop that in terminal and reboot?
[08:53] <crimsun> yes, that entire command is one line (from the echo through the /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base )
[08:53] <zipzo> gotcha
[08:54] <zipzo> ok crimsun, gonna reboot now. thank you so much
[08:54] <zipzo> ill be back in a minute to let you know
[08:54] <crimsun> k
[08:54] <sky123> crimson: i missed the original post the recommendation was for sound cards that some times start and other times dont on boot?
[08:55] <crimsun> sky123: are you referring to this previous discussion?
[08:55] <sky123> yep
[08:55] <crimsun> sky123: that discussion has nothing to do with the issue you describe.

[08:57] <Akkabus> hi, me have question about the GNOME file browser window--to the right of the main toolbar, there's a tiny black smidge, does anyone know how to get rid of it?
[08:58] <Samus_Aran> Akkabus: I don't know, myself, I don't use Gnome, but I recommend asking in the official Gnome IRC channel at irc://irc.gimp.org/#gnome
=== hutch_ is now known as bokey
[08:58] <roryy> Akkabus: hrm, looks like the gnome foot
[08:59] <maz> has anyone tried upgrading to Edgy?  I thought about it but I read the horror stories on ubuntuforums.org and have decided not to for now
[08:59] <zipzo> crimsun: works great. thank
[08:59] <crimsun> zipzo: np
[08:59] <maz> I'm pretty happy with Dapper
[08:59] <Madpilot> Samus_Aran, do you mean the Gnome foot logo on the right side of the toolbar?
[08:59] <Akkabus> ill go there in a few minutes, ty samus :)
[08:59] <roryy> maz: i didt-upgrade'd to edgy without problems
[08:59] <roryy> dist-upgrade'd, even
[08:59] <zipzo> this problem seems to happen with more than a few ppl
[09:00] <defrysk> maz, it can be done but might fail make sure to have a proper backup
[09:00] <Samus_Aran> Madpilot: not sure, Akkabus was the one asking =)
[09:00] <maz> ok roryy... do you have a new PC or an old one?  Mine's from 2001
[09:00] <Samus_Aran> maz: I am in the process of upgrading atm
[09:00] <roryy> maz: mine's from 2003 (I think)
[09:00] <Madpilot> Samus_Aran, sorry, brain lapse ;)
[09:00] <crimsun> zipzo: be careful about recommendations. Similar -- even identical -- symptoms often have very different causes.
[09:00] <Samus_Aran> maz: and the speed is not going nice anymore, won't be finished downloading for 12 hours ..
[09:00] <BlackHawk> moin
[09:00] <zipzo> right
[09:00] <Madpilot> Akkabus, do you mean the Gnome foot logo on the far right of the panel?
[09:00] <zipzo> ill just post what "worked" for me
[09:00] <Akkabus> madpilot yeah
[09:01] <maz> defrysk - good advice.  I don't have a dvd burner so backups have to be done on CD - a real pain.  If I'd thought things through better, I would have partitioned my disk so my home directory was a separate partition and I could try things out in there.  Or have a testing partition
[09:01] <Akkabus> i can't see it well enough to make out what it is lol...
[09:01] <crimsun> zipzo: be sure to describe the debugging steps you followed with me
[09:01] <zipzo> the threads i got the idea from were on the right track
[09:01] <maz> samus_aran is that because everyone is trying to download it now?
[09:01] <zipzo> i dont remember them :P ill just give em your email! hahah j/k
[09:01] <Madpilot> Akkabus, as far as I know, you're stuck with it. There is a bug out there asking for it to be made clearer, or swap it for an Ubuntu logo or similar
[09:01] <defrysk> !backup | maz
[09:01] <ubotu> maz: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi
[09:01] <dxdemetriou> I have a problem with the firefox 2. there are sites that can't open and it crash. anybody with the same problem?
[09:01] <Samus_Aran> maz: I am not sure.  it started out going at several hundred KiB/sec .. then went up and down for a while, now it has leveled out at only 60KiB/sec
[09:01] <maz> thanks defrysk
[09:02] <Akkabus> ok mad, ill look around with that in mind, ty
[09:02] <defrysk> maz, good luck :)
[09:02] <crimsun> zipzo: pretty much every audio problem gets to my inbox anyhow.
[09:02] <zipzo> well, i also didnt know about automatix. is that why my libSDl wasnt the official one?
[09:02] <Samus_Aran> dxdemetriou: try disabling plugins and try again.  then you have at least narrowed down the possible causes a bit
[09:03] <crimsun> zipzo: no, it's because your SDL app includes its own libSDL, which is hardcoded to use OSS instead of ALSA
[09:03] <crimsun> zipzo: prior, /dev/dsp pointed to your onboard, and /dev/dsp1 pointed to your Audigy
[09:04] <crimsun> zipzo: we've simply reversed the latter by making your Audigy the default for everything
[09:04] <zipzo> did we change that? is that why it works now? because its using alsa?
[09:04] <zipzo> ahhh
[09:04] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: Reminds me - I should go back and try to submit a better bug report of my mic problem.
[09:04] <ncstoneman> what is the trick to get alsa to see my laptop mic?
[09:04] <zipzo> well, thnx agai. this is the second time, maybe third you have helped me :P i should mail you a cookie
[09:05] <defrysk> lol
[09:05] <crimsun> ncstoneman: if there was a simple trick, I think the sky would have fallen. It's utterly dependent on a number of factors.
[09:05] <crimsun> "if there were", even
[09:05] <dxdemetriou> Samus_Aran, it is the same problem. the good thing is that have the restore session
[09:06] <ncstoneman> I set gmixer to mic and it goes to capture
[09:07] <stephenishere> ls
[09:07] <stephenishere> hi
[09:07] <jtf0518> tonyyarusso, ncstoneman, I had problems with my mic until I messed with the alsamixer. I had to turn on the mux setting and boost it's volume to get the mic working even after I'd maxed out the mic volume and made sure it was on.
[09:07] <jtf0518> I have the HDA Intel sound chip
[09:07] <crimsun> that's not very specific, jtf0518.
[09:08] <neenaoffline> I am unable to hear any sound
[09:08] <jtf0518> crimsun, pardon?
[09:08] <crimsun> what ultimately matters for audio issues is what _codec_ you have, which is not the same as the driver you use.
[09:08] <stephenishere> Okay well im having a problem getting my ubuntu to start. once my computer starts to uncompress the kernal i lose picture
[09:08] <crimsun> when you speak of audio, you need to say, "I use such and such codec"
[09:08] <stephenishere> i deleted xgl and i guess i forgot to update my xorg
[09:08] <crimsun> find it in ``tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat''
[09:08] <stephenishere> i ahve a backup of my xorg but i cant get to it
[09:09] <stephenishere> ive tried ctrl+alt+f1 and that does nothing
[09:09] <jtf0518> crimsun, I'm not sure what codec is being used by Alsa for the mic. How do I find that out?
[09:09] <stephenishere> i get VGA Not supported ;/
[09:09] <ncstoneman> Do codecs affect kernel drivers for ac97?
[09:09] <toogreen> Hi there, i have issues with Suspend on my laptop... Sometimes it works, sometimes it just hangs there and the light doesn't go off.. then my only choice is to reset the laptop. Any clues how I can fix that?
[09:09] <crimsun> ncstoneman: yes
[09:09] <crimsun> all ac'97 and HDA "sound" have a codec
[09:10] <ncstoneman> If I have the kernel modules set , i still need a codec to run the mic ?
[09:10] <crimsun> ncstoneman: the codec is what allows you to hear sound period.
[09:11] <dxdemetriou> can I make debug to see the problem in firefox?
[09:11] <Tree> Does the Ubuntu liveCD come with any compilers?
[09:11] <crimsun> ncstoneman: note that we're speaking of hardware, not a software mp3/divx/vorbis/whatever codec
[09:11] <jtf0518> I thought codecs were for coding and decoding various audio and video formats and weren't specific to the sound card or sound chip being used.
[09:11] <crimsun> see above.
[09:12] <Samus_Aran> dxdemetriou: so it crashes even if you turn off the plugins in preferences ?
[09:12] <crimsun> your audio driver is comprised of two components, a dsp and a codec
[09:12] <Samus_Aran> dxdemetriou: also, what error does it show on the console, when you run "firefox" from an xterm or similar ?
[09:12] <jtf0518> crimsun, so we're talking about a firmware codec or a software codec specific to the hardware?
[09:12] <crimsun> the aforementioned codec is orthogonal to the various audio/video format ones.
[09:13] <Samus_Aran> ncstoneman: if you're just trying to record with your mic, open up alsamixer in a terminal and press Tab to switch to the input selector

[09:13] <talkIRC> ok i've read a ton
[09:13] <talkIRC> now i think i can find something useful
[09:14] <talkIRC> i'm going to the maker of the modem to see if they have a pre compiled linux driver.... i hope
[09:14] <rad|x> hi, does anyone know why i am getting 'no rule to make target 'arch/i386/kernel/msr.c' when i try to build my module?
[09:14] <Samus_Aran> does anyone know if Ubuntu will automatically reboot the system if I am not around once it is done downloading all the upgrades ?
[09:14] <Samus_Aran> I do not want it rebooting ...
[09:14] <crimsun> Samus_Aran: it won't.
[09:14] <ncstoneman> agreed, my desktop with a true sb works fine, my laptop with a ac97 does everything inc. the modem fine, except the mic. alsa defaults to capture, not mic, regardless.
=== hutch_ is now known as bokey
[09:14] <Samus_Aran> crimsun: okay, thanks
[09:14] <VigoFuse> Software interacts with the Hardware, and visa versa, the software is written for specific hardware, sometimes it is flexible, but the unioun if the 2 is what makes a pooter sing or dance.Is that statement true?
[09:14] <crimsun> ncstoneman: "ALSA" defaults to the first element that has Capture capability, actually.
[09:15] <Samus_Aran> gotta get back to studying, night all
[09:15] <talkIRC> roryy: thanks for all the help so far, i'll be back if i need more

[09:15] <ncstoneman> I just plugged the mic in the lap and it works, uniwill kao258 x64. I guess the onboard is picky
[09:15] <RMorris84> anyone have a psp here? im just got one and connected a usb cable to it, and nothing happens... i want to add music to my memory stick
[09:16] <crimsun> ncstoneman: (meaning the onboard has multiple elements capable of Capture, yes)

[09:17] <Laosboyme> hey guys
[09:17] <jtf0518> localhost, you can boot from the LiveCd and use Gparted to resize.
[09:17] <Laosboyme> how could i install kubuntu without deleting any item
[09:17] <ncstoneman> Can i create profiles for sound, i.e. mobile= onboard, home= 6+1 dsp ?
[09:18] <crimsun> ncstoneman: not yet. We're discussing that for Feisty+1.
[09:18] <jtf0518> or you can download a Gparted LiveCd that boots linux and runs Gparted.
[09:18] <dxdemetriou> I have this error on firefox: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32696/

[09:20] <VigoFuse> Is Synaptic needed or suggested to use in the Ubuntu? it looks like a neat program, but is it supported and stable?
[09:21] <roadboy_> hi all. i've to change the bootup scripts sequence. i need one script start before than another. how can i do this?
[09:21] <ncstoneman> CorpseFeeder you ran automatix ?
[09:22] <jtf0518> nite everyone
[09:22] <Spee_Der> VigoFuse: Synaptic, it is rather stable and reliable.
[09:22] <CorpseFeeder> ncstoneman: not recently
[09:22] <VigoFuse> Spee_Dee: Thank you
[09:22] <CorpseFeeder> i cant remember

[09:28] <roadboy_> leafw, apps \ metacity \ general \ button_layout
[09:28] <sky123> i guess last try tonight..any one familiar with ubuntu on Sparc install??
[09:29] <leafw> roadboy_ : oh. I se,e thanks
[09:29] <leafw> roadboy_ : and can one put them on the left end?
[09:29] <VigoFuse> The gpated install process is what got my win2kpro back, plus it put XP back intsa place, so now it can be removed easier.
[09:29] <leafw> roadboy_ : like, the closing button on the left end, and the other two on the right?
[09:30] <leafw> roadboy_ I'm just closing too many windows by accident
[09:30] <roadboy_> leafw, yes you can. just use minimize,maximize,close:menu
[09:30] <leafw> roadboy_ : nm, the colon!
[09:30] <pibarnas> audio preview in nautilus isn't okay. the mp3 files are not plaued well. The songs struggle! Any ideas to fix it?

[09:31] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[09:31] <leafw> and different images for each workspace, is that possible at all?
[09:32] <Jordan_U> leafw: Like different desktop backgrounds?
[09:32] <leafw> Jordan_U : yes
[09:32] <leafw> Jordan_U : I went and set a different desktop image for each workspace, just to find out that each time all desktops were being edited at the same time.
[09:33] <leafw> whichs makes no sense

[09:33] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[09:33] <VigoFuse> I have been toying with multiple user accounts in an effort to do what leafw is speaking of, sorta. it kinda works, so far,,,
[09:34] <Jordan_U> loca|host: Boot the Ubuntu LiveCD and go to System -> Administration -> Gnome partition editor
[09:34] <loca|host> leafw, is it possible to resize a mounted fs ? i want to resize the /
[09:35] <Jordan_U> loca|host: No, you will need to use a liveCD.
[09:35] <leafw> loca|host : I don't think so.
[09:35] <leafw> VigoFuse : that is such an overhead. Makes no sense to have different users just to have different desktop images
[09:36] <bhudda> Little help here...what do I do to correct this?? "glGo: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL_image-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
[09:36] <Jordan_U> leafw: I am sure ther is a way to make a script that would change the Desktop backround whenever you changed workspaces, which would be equivilent to what you want.
[09:36] <VigoFuse> I like playing arouns with stiuff just to see find the limitations and maybe stumble upon a something that helps others.
[09:37] <leafw> Jordan_U : I expected the setup to be trivial, like in kubuntu (kde)
[09:37] <leafw> Jordan_U : so whatever ...
[09:37] <Jordan_U> leafw: It may be, I have never heard of anybody doing this, I didn't think KDE could do it iether.
[09:38] <leafw> Jordan_U : in KDE, editing the background of a desktop changes only that desktop, not all.
[09:38] <Jordan_U> leafw: That actually sounds counter intuitive to me :)
[09:39] <leafw> Jordan_U : ha! But then, I was a kde user for 3 years
[09:39] <leafw> finally gnome has become the promise that it always was
[09:39] <roadboy_> leafw, yes you can. just use minimize,maximize,close:menu
[09:39] <leafw> if only it was easier to configure (as in GUI-based config, not editing entries in a secret app that does not even have a menu entry)
[09:40] <CorpseFeeder> anyone know of any linux software which will use a Creative Prodikeys keyboard - the one like a normal keyboard with a piano keboard attached to it, which came out about 5 years ago? Like this one http://www.prodikeys.com/products/prodikeys_DM
[09:40] <roadboy> hi all. i've to change the bootup scripts sequence. i need one script start before than another. how can i do this?
[09:40] <leafw> roadboy: with bash 'wait', you can make one script wait for the other to return, and execute in a nested fashion
[09:41] <roadboy> leafw, i tried bu it didn't work.
[09:41] <bhudda> Thats a neat looking keyboard. I want one!
[09:41] <gourdin> <

[09:42] <VigoFuse> That keyboard ROCKS! :-)

[09:44] <cavediver> Hi there. I have php4 installed and needed the php4-pear package. somehow it wanted to install php5. Hos iw that ? Is there no php-pear package for php4 only ?
[09:44] <talkIRC-afk> quick question that might be a really dumb question, how do i find out exactly what kernal version i have?
[09:44] <cavediver> uname -a
[09:45] <talkIRC-afk> (6.06 ver dapper)
[09:45] <talkIRC-afk> so i put ((uname -a)) in the terminal?
[09:45] <cavediver> yes
[09:46] <defrysk> uname -a
[09:46] <leafw> now if only I could get rid of the window frames altogether (what a waste) I would feel completely at home in gnome
[09:46] <defrysk> or uname -r
[09:46] <wikityler> is there a way i can see the transfer speed of a file between local disks?
[09:46] <talkIRC-afk> thanks guys
[09:46] <Jordan_U> talkIRC-afk: "uname -r" for just the kernel version
[09:46] <cavediver> Yer most welcome.
[09:46] <defrysk>  /cat/etc/issue for ubuntu-version
[09:46] <CorpseFeeder> that's not a dumb question. A dumb question is like "how do I stop milk from going off in dapper?"
[09:47] <blind> leafw: I feel ya. The only reason I use window frames is resizing.

[09:52] <blind> leafw: give it a try ;)
[09:52] <Jordan_U> denver1: Debian packages are not always compatable with Ubuntu.
[09:52] <leafw> blind: which of the options you pass to eterm is actually doing so?
[09:52] <denver1> well its a mepis dvd
[09:53] <blind> leafw: my guess would be --scrollbar=off and --buttonbar 0
[09:53] <leafw> blind: ok, the button bar
[09:53] <BadKitty> No one is responding in the xgl channel so I want to ask if anyone here is using beryl cause I have a question...

[09:54] <asn> hello!I upgraded to dapper from breezy server edtion.and i install xfc4 ,but the x connot run :(
[09:54] <leafw> blind: just realized, I have aterm but not eterm
[09:54] <blind> asn, why not?
[09:54] <tonquin> i've check the partition with e2fsck and it seems fine.... just full.
[09:55] <tonquin> to full to allow ubuntu to boot.
[09:55] <blind> leafw, haha, im sure you can do it in that as well, check the man file

[09:55] <blind> asn, doubtful.
[09:55] <leafw> blind: and I remmeber the problem with eterm is that I can't type tildes on vowels (for non-english languages)
[09:55] <Jordan_U> asn: try sudo gdm to check.
[09:55] <blind> leafw: sure you can
[09:55] <sky123> VigoFuse:  i use k3b...its pretty intuitive
[09:55] <asn> ok ,i'll try it
[09:55] <VigoFuse> Thank you
[09:56] <leafw> blind: then it's not obvious, the encoding I set was the proper one and yet no tildes
[09:56] <blind> Wait, I thought you could.. maybe you can't.
[09:56] <blind> it's not working for me. O_o
[09:56] <leafw> see xD
[09:56] <blind> heh!
[09:57] <sky123> VigoFuse: the hardcore was are to use dd, cdrecord, mkisofs...etc

[09:58] <sky123> VigoFuse: a cool one..if you want to a full system backup is ...mondoarchive and mondorestore..part of mondorescue
[09:58] <VigoFuse> That is the way we learned how to, RTFM and MAFB was and is like the Golden Cow of Computers
[09:59] <VigoFuse> That Mondorescue I have seen used, that thing is awesome

[10:15] <Stanbey> Morning! I've just installed Ubuntu and I've got a few issues. The main one at the moment is that when a user tries to log-out the system just hangs with their empty desktop background (shifter up a couple of cm) and a frozen mouse pointer.
[10:15] <Ayabara> good morning (here at least). I installed kubuntu-desktop to try it out, but I think I like gnome better. I suspect an apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop won't rid me of what I got by installing it?
[10:16] <leafw> kosnick : read man dpkg

[10:22] <umops> can anyone reccommend a way to backup files to a windows share from ubuntu?  I would like to use rsync, but I don't think that would  work copying the files from linux to windows?
[10:23] <sky123> that is where..id didnt pay close enough attention...i think these are sessions are logged somehwere..and I remember the post at about 2:30AM PST
[10:23] <al1en_drop> hey all :-)
[10:24] <roryy> umops: you can mount the windows share using samba; then it looks like part of the ubuntu filesystem.
[10:25] <umops> okay roryy, that sounds good.  So from there i can rsync the files?
[10:25] <sky123> umops: there is a ton of ways to do this.. one  I know is use to use cygwin,  create a key using sshkeygen, then write a small script that will pull the files via scp.

[10:26] <umops> sky123, thanks, i might look at that if i cant get roryy's method to work
[10:26] <TrendKi||> umops, i would tar things onto a samba share...I dont trust windows filesystems with unix-like file permissions and ownerships
[10:26] <sky123> umops: my only issue with smb, is that the connection stays open..
[10:26] <sky123> but like i said a bunch of ways
[10:27] <roryy> xenex: you can scratch around on art.ubuntu.com, or in /usr/share/icons/ (and possibly other /usr/share/ directories)
[10:27] <Jordan_U> fulhack: You might want to look into totem-xine , although I don't know if this is a gstreamer vs xine ( the backend ) problem or a totem vs xine ( the player )
[10:27] <umops> TrendKi||, thats a good point.  Hmm.
[10:27] <xenex> well i don't have ubuntu installed and i want the icons for windows
[10:27] <Jordan_U> Is ther a way to convert a backup of an msSQL database to mySQL without the msSQL server ( and if possible, without windows at all )?
[10:27] <umops> sky123, I will get one way working first and then try and optimise/make it secure :), need to get this workjing as soon as i can unfortunatly
[10:27] <fulhack> Jordan_U: Oh, Totem uses gstreamer for video? Perhaps I can tell gstreamer where my codecs are then!
[10:27] <sky123> umops: good enough ;)
[10:28] <umops> sky123, yep :D
[10:28] <niru> umops:do you know any package for icon zooming
[10:28] <sky123> umops: winbloze and linux interoperabilty...nothing but fun!
[10:28] <xenex> roryy: do you think you can put together a zip of ubuntu's icons for me?
[10:29] <sky123> Jordan_U: there has gotta be a tool on the internet or a script to help you do that.. did a google search pend anything?
[10:29] <Jordan_U> fulhack: Probably, I don't actually know much about this subject, but totem can use either gstreamer or xine as a backend, Ubuntu uses totem-gsreamer by default but you can install totem-xine also.
[10:30] <fulhack> Jordan_U: Aha, that's really helpful. I'd rather get the whole system to use the "right thing", so I'll try getting gstreamer working.
[10:30] <roryy> xenex: sorry, no. /usr/share/icons is 62M, i'm on dial-up, and i'm sure you can get them elsewhere
[10:30] <sky123> anyone know of a good bash-scripting guide other than the advanced bash scripting guide that sits on the internet??
[10:30] <Ayabara> can someone please answer if they know? is there a way to remove kubuntu-desktop and kde packages to get back to a pure gnome install?
[10:30] <Jordan_U> sky123: There is an officail migration tool from mySQL, but it requires the msSQL server, which is dead :(
[10:31] <sky123> damn that sucks

[10:31] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: Yes.
[10:31] <Lynoure> sky123: does the advanced one say it's advanced, or how can I make sure what I point you to is not that?
[10:31] <Jordan_U> sky123: A verry unstable NT4 ( ew I know ) and a backup of the database.
[10:32] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, an easier way than to reinstall? :-)

[10:33] <sky123> Lynoure: Well when you get to the middle of the so-called advanced bash scripting guide..just google for it.. when you get past the use of cases...it gets less and less informative.. lol

[10:33] <abuyazan> how can i show all available wireless connections on my area
[10:33] <Lynoure> sky123: btw, that was the second hit on google for "bash scripting"

[10:35] <sky123> Lynoure: I suppose Im just complaining about the bashscripting guide...ie the advanced one.. but use cases go from simple explanation to complex example and over again...just makes it tough to follow and practice..
[10:35] <Jordan_U> sky123: Yes, and if I can't get it to work in mySQL they are just going to continue trying to upgrade the server to 2003 server, which they have been trying to get working for a week.

[10:44] <Jordan_U> Alzi2: I just don't have the time right now to give full instructions, basically you need to get the list of dependencies of kubuntu that aren't included in Ubuntu and remove them.
[10:44] <sky123> Jordan_U: does navicat have the ability to do this for you?
[10:44] <unimatrix9> oh he is gone

[10:47] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, one last Q. you say 'get the list of dependencies in kubuntu bot not ubuntu'. Is this a manual job, or a command line job?
[10:48] <dsb> anyone have a ubuntu with all the developer tools installed? I tried to install a package by its source but I don't have all the necessary tools. Does there exist some type of meta package to get that working?
[10:48] <nothlit> unimatrix9, you should definitely only order as much as you need i think if you go over 100 you have to start paying
[10:48] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: A command line job, let me try something quickly...
[10:48] <unimatrix9> i had 20 cdroms , and now its come to an halt...
[10:48] <sky123> dsb: past build-essential??
[10:49] <boink> dsb: apt-get build-essential
[10:49] <TrendKi||> abuyazan, ok, im sorry, i thought that  system->administration->networking was just the GUI version of iwconfig... i'm not sure how to do it GUI-style...maybe someone else in the channel knows how to
[10:49] <boink> dsb: apt-get install build-essential
[10:49] <Luck> I want buy a cheap scanner for my Ubuntu 6.06. Can you recomment a good and work well?
[10:49] <nothlit> unimatrix9, why in the world would you need 20?
[10:49] <abuyazan> thnaks TrendKi||
[10:49] <unimatrix9> was distributing them on my computer club ( 4000 memebers )
[10:49] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: Try this command http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32706/
[10:49] <dsb> ok thanks all!
[10:50] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: Are you confortable with the terminal?
[10:50] <nothlit> Yeah you should burn them or reimburse shipit
[10:50] <TrendKi||> abuyazan, no worries...i think they're might be a package you can install...let me check
[10:51] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, yep. thanks. will have to switch to ubuntu first. I want to keep a couple of things. amarok is one. should  just run your line and reinstall afterwards?
[10:51] <unimatrix9> yes, i am looking into that too, turning some computer into an ubuntu burn station..
[10:51] <abuyazan> thanks TrendKi||
[10:51] <dsb> Luck, try linuxprinting.org an excellent resource for printers and such
[10:52] <sky123> unimatrix9: or use LTSP..and have them grab a terminal...;)
[10:52] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: Yes, that would probably be easiest.
[10:52] <Luck> dsb: I want scanner.
[10:52] <unimatrix9> :P
[10:52] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, ok. off I go. I'll report back :-)
[10:52] <vrancken> hello evrybody
[10:52] <boink> don't most cheapo usb scanners work on linux?
[10:52] <dsb> Luck: I think they have info about scanners there too
[10:53] <vrancken> hello
[10:53] <sky123> okay one Sun Netra T1 with Ubuntu Sparc done...whooo hooo!
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[10:53] <dsb> coolio sky123!
[10:54] <sky123> dsb: thing was like 150 bucks...:)
[10:54] <Alzi2> My PC has gotten very slow in a few months. Why has this happened, and how to speed it all up again? Anyone?
[10:54] <Luck> dsb: I think that no. http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html is about scanners.
[10:54] <TrendKi||> abuyazan, well there appear to be quite a few apps for KDE to scan for wireless networks...do you want to stick to GNOME apps or do you not mind poluting your system with kde?
[10:54] <Jordan_U> sky123: That last link states "System Requirements: 32MB RAM, MS SQL environment" :(
[10:55] <Luck> Have you somebody good experience with anyone?
[10:55] <dsb> I pulled out a this 233 from a friends garage that he was cleaning out and now is running ubuntu LAMP, drupal webserver
[10:55] <sky123> Jordan_U: damn...but the navicat?
[10:55] <dsb> pentium 233
[10:55] <sky123> Jordan_U: I think that runs on linux right??
[10:55] <Jordan_U> sky123: Checking...
[10:56] <mats> uname -a
[10:56] <abuyazan> i want to work with GNOME
[10:56] <sky123> Luck: your last post..is a metaphysical question ;)
[10:56] <dsb> oh and I think my dns is working now, must have been a problem at zoneedit
[10:56] <mexp> Hello.. need help with mounting error. I can't get my cdrom mounted on Breezy. Can someone pls help?
[10:56] <unimatrix9> alzi2 , type df in console and see if its related to diskspace..
[10:57] <sky123> dsb: cool man
[10:57] <umops> abuyazan, what kind of program are you after?
[10:57] <sky123> dsb: scallions something...what was the site??
[10:57] <dsb> now I'm stuck with the task of being a designer, ...ahem...
[10:57] <mexp> The error I get is "Error: could not execute pmount"
[10:57] <talkIR1> hey roryy guess what
[10:57] <dsb> www.ripperscallions.com
[10:58] <Luck> sky123: sorry, I am not good at English.
[10:58] <unimatrix9> alzi2 , then type free, see how much mem you have got free...
[10:58] <sky123> Luck: I found it intelligent really...:)
[10:58] <pfred1> Luck me either it never stopped me yet though
[10:58] <talkIR1> oops
[10:59] <sky123> dsb: well there it is! :)
[10:59] <mats> aim
[10:59] <sky123> dsb: lemme check dnstoosl and see what it says
[10:59] <mats> sorry
[10:59] <dsb> alrighty, so it wasn't me, it was them zoneeditors
[10:59] <Jordan_U> sky123: navicat looks to actually import from the database directly :)
[10:59] <talkIR1> well guys, i've proven that if one peice of hardware doesn't work you can always try another one, i finally made it online with dial-up and i'm in ubuntu not my windows box
[10:59] <sky123> dsb: yep
[11:00] <sky123> Jordan_U: next up I suppoise is to actually ask the mysql homies...which i started for ya in mysql
[11:00] <talkIR1> it's been a long night but i have proven that with time and effort anyone, even a n00b, can learn how to make it work, lol
[11:01] <sky123> Jordan_U: but as usual my questions are ignored..probably a little too novice..lol
[11:01] <Jordan_U> sky123: Thanks, should have gone ther first :)
[11:01] <talkIR1> what's the question jordan?
[11:01] <mats> talkIR1: Good jobb :)
[11:01] <sky123> Jordan_U: well.. thats the usual frikin answers i usually get..I am really interested in the solution..
[11:01] <dsb> talkIR1, congrats, I can understand your fustration. Try finding a cdrom drive at Fry's that will work with just a pentium 233. Almost all them had min requirements of pentium 500 or above
[11:01] <talkIR1> thanks, i feel like i actualy did something good for a change

[11:02] <VigoFusion> talkR1: The fun is making a hardware/software interact, but gratzi on getting something accomplished, there is allways a solution, seek the solutions and there will be no problems.

[11:03] <talkIR1> nice to be out from under microsoft for a change
[11:03] <sky123> talkR1: id research the network boot, image building..then use the network to eliminate some of these issues..youll learn a snot load that way
[11:03] <unimatrix9> Alzi2, you seem to have an lot loaded , lots of programs and processes running..
[11:03] <mats> Alzi2: you got 241 mb free memory
[11:03] <Alzi2> Top says otherwise..
[11:04] <defrysk> free 241
[11:04] <Alzi2> I only have firefox, Liferea, gaim, rhythmbox, x-chat and a GNOME-Terminal running..
[11:04] <dsb> ok I think I got my dev tools installed, now to find out why mysql-server-5.0 is not installing
[11:04] <talkIR1> thx u guys, even running on this old box makes it all the more enjoyable, pent celron 533
[11:04] <pfred1> Alzi2 cached 167
[11:04] <Jordan_U> umops: I have an unstable nt4 machine which has been used as a database server, it finally died, but there is a backup of the database itself.
[11:04] <mats> talkIR1: a step right, keep on working and reading
[11:04] <defrysk> Alzi2, linux uses as much ram as possible for ram is faster then your harddrive
[11:04] <pfred1> Alzi2 you do realize that free memory is wasted memory right?
[11:04] <zypherone> Anyone had this problem with Amarok? My music collection has been imported okay, but no items in the collection tab will expand at all (I can click on the expand button, but nothing happens). Any ideas?
[11:04] <sky123> umops: his mssql box took a dive, he has a backup, needs to take that backup and convert it to mysql
[11:04] <Alzi2> pfred1: erm..... i'm not an expert in CPU memory
[11:04] <zypherone> This is a fresh install of Edgy
[11:04] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, and I'm all gnome again :-D , thanks for helping out
[11:05] <defrysk> Alzi2, unused ram = wasted ram
[11:05] <unimatrix9> Alzi2 problem is that his system is running slower and slower
[11:05] <pfred1> Alzi2 neither are any of us that is why we use OSes to manage our system resources for us
[11:05] <unimatrix9> thats what we where looking at
[11:05] <umops> Jordan_U, and sky123, okay... I am not up to speed with MSSQL, does it use all standard SQL?
[11:05] <pfred1> Alzi2 when you need the memory the OS will unload cache to free up what it needs
[11:05] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: np, I just ran apt-get install kubuntu and copied the packages it said it would intall then put apt-get remove in front of it :)
[11:06] <unimatrix9> so any tips for him are welcome , to free up wasted resources
[11:06] <defrysk> Alzi2, usually apps like azureus tend to slow down an os
[11:06] <talkIR1> have a good night guys, if i have another problem that i need help with i'll be back to get directions for the right answers ;)
[11:06] <pfred1> Alzi2 until then when you call up often used data the OS can fetch it faster out of cache than the disk
[11:06] <VigoFusion> My next project,after the ATI XPRESS 200 doodad, is to load Ubuntu on my AMS Tech lappy, I think its a 133 or some such,havent booted it in 2 months.
[11:06] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, ahh. I should've thought about that.
[11:06] <sky123> umops: id suppose..but then again it is WINDOZE
[11:07] <mats> Jordan_U: you can allso run apt-catch search kubuntu and it gives  you all the dpkg-files ;)
=== talkIR1 is now known as talkIRC-afk
[11:07] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: But you would have needed a system without kubuntu-desktop installed to do it, kind of catch 22.
[11:07] <sky123> umops: i think i know where you are headed..dump the sql queries into mysql.. but there has gotta be a tool for that
[11:07] <mats> or kubuntu-desktop
[11:07] <Alzi2> hmm..
[11:07] <umops> sky123, depending on that, it should be very simple to execute the script.
[11:07] <defrysk> mats, ist apt-cache ;)
[11:07] <mats> defrysk: ;) damn, offcource
[11:08] <pfred1> Alzi2 I have double the RAM you do and 38MB free do I look concerned?
[11:08] <sky123> umops: the question is the complexity of the db i guess...but it is a good thought
[11:08] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, that's true :-)
[11:08] <Alzi2> pfred1: no
[11:08] <pfred1>   5:08am  up 45 days  5:56,  4 users,  load average: 0.04, 0.01, 0.01
[11:08] <pfred1> for good reason I am not
[11:08] <Alzi2> pfred1: The problem is my system keeps getting slower and slower.
[11:08] <Alzi2> And a reboot etc doesn't help
[11:08] <unimatrix9> Alzi2 take an look at process management, see tab processes
[11:08] <pfred1> Alzi2 kill off unused processes or get more resources
[11:08] <umops> sky123, depending on the differences in syntax it would be possible to either find and replace or match some regular expressions to get the correct syntax
[11:08] <mats> Alzi2: run top and you can see whats using all the memory
[11:09] <unimatrix9> or top
[11:09] <Ayabara> well now that I'm rid of kde I need to choose a torrent client. azureus, utorrent under wine, or transmission are the ones I'm thinking about. any advice?
[11:09] <pfred1> Alzi2 in this day and age some more RAM wouldn't hurt you
[11:09] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: By the way, if you install using the alternate CD in edgy you can just apt-get autoremove kubuntu , but for some reason that won't work for liveCD installs.
[11:09] <pfred1> Alzi2 do you use an GUI ?
[11:09] <sky123> Alzi2: Id see if you can get something like cacti installed.  Then pull snmp traps..and see when/what the pattern looks like when it slows down.
[11:09] <Ayabara> Jordan_U, ok. hope I will never need to do it ;-)
[11:09] <Alzi2> gnome-panel uses 1%, rhythmbox 9% and the process monitor 6% CPU. Not many memory usage btw
[11:09] <Alzi2> pfred1: Yes. GNOME
[11:09] <umops> Ayabara, try torrentflux.
[11:10] <pfred1> oh gawd not gnome!
[11:10] <unimatrix9> pfred1,you going to advise him to go for command line only eh?
[11:10] <unimatrix9> ;)
[11:10] <Cosmonaut3030> Does anyone know how to get Frozen-Bubble2 in Ubuntu? An Ubuntu deb woul help...
[11:10] <Alzi2> pfred1: I'm afraid so. See, this is my everyday desktop machine which has to be easy to use
[11:10] <mats> Alzi2: install fluxbox and you got free off all you leak off a slowdesktop
[11:10] <pfred1> unimatrix9 he could use a less resource intensive window manager
[11:10] <unimatrix9> ah
[11:10] <Jordan_U> Ayabara: But since you installed ubuntu-desktop post install you can go back any time with apt-get autoremove ubuntu-desktop.
[11:10] <pfred1> Alzi2 try blackbox or windowmaker they're not bad
[11:10] <sky123> umops: hmmm..maybe we should have him pastebin the entire sql dump? assuming its not huge??
[11:10] <pfred1> icewm supposed to be nice too
[11:11] <Alzi2> pfred1: But are they good for an everyday PC?
[11:11] <pfred1> I've used windowmaker a lot on less powerful boxes you do the menu right it is fine
[11:11] <Cosmonaut3030> Openbox is fine^
[11:11] <Ayabara> umops, I need to set up a webserver for it? what I like about utorrent and transmission(?) is that they're so lightweight
[11:11] <Alzi2> So it's even fine on a PC you use everyday, which is your main PC with Ubuntu on it?
[11:11] <Ayabara> brb
[11:11] <Cosmonaut3030> Does anyone know how to get Frozen-Bubble2 in Ubuntu? An Ubuntu deb woul help...
[11:11] <umops> sky123, firstly i think he should try and directly run the script to see what the errors are
[11:12] <mats> Cosmonaut3030: openbox is very nice ;))
[11:12] <pfred1> this is not my Ubuntu box that box is in my garage but it uses windowmaker
[11:12] <Cosmonaut3030> mats: I've used it a couple times, it's lovely
[11:12] <Alzi2> Cuz I have a laptop which I use for script development and stuff.. lots of window managers are on it, including dwm and wmii :P
[11:12] <Jordan_U> sky123: Proprietary info there, can't just pastebin a dump of it all :)
[11:12] <sky123> umops: good plan..Id suggest that directly to him
[11:12] <umops> Ayabara, yes you would need to.  I guess it depends what features you want
[11:12] <Alzi2> Okay so me install fluxbox, yesh?
[11:12] <sky123> Jordan_U: umops had a good idea..can you try an import of the db by hand and see what errors pop up?
[11:13] <umops> sky123, who has the problem? hehe
[11:13] <pfred1> Alzi2 mostly that box is an overgrown ipod i use it to play music while i work but i do some other stuff with it too from time to time
[11:13] <sky123> umops: Jordan_U
[11:13] <mats> Alzi2: try it out, if you dont like it you can just logg-on gnome again
[11:13] <Alzi2> pfred1: Lol..... that's computer molesting!
[11:13] <pfred1> yeah switching window managers easier than changing your socks
[11:13] <Alzi2> mats: K.. should I first kill every GNOME process?
[11:14] <pfred1> install another window manager log out of session pick other window manager start new session
[11:14] <CorpseFeeder> i installed 'rosegarden' midi/audio sequencer from synaptic to see what it does. It won't launch from the applications menu entry for it and this is what I get from starting it in a terminal - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32702/
[11:14] <Jordan_U> Cosmonaut3030: http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/
[11:14] <pfred1> you change at the login
[11:14] <unimatrix9> Alzi2, it will not solve your problem i think
[11:14] <mats> unimatrix9: its worth a try ;p
[11:14] <unimatrix9> Alzi2, how does it run when you close all apps, and just use one at a time?
[11:15] <Cosmonaut3030> Jordan_U: I tried all that, the repo that somebody was hosting was down yesterday, but it seems to be up now :D
[11:15] <unimatrix9> is it then at its normal speed?
[11:15] <sky123> Alzi2: if you are familiar with vmstat you can check to see if something is context switching
[11:15] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder oh nice you don't have write permissions
[11:15] <unimatrix9> Alzi2, how does it run when you close all apps, and just use one at a time?
[11:16] <CorpseFeeder> why doesn't it let me have write permisions?
[11:16] <Jordan_U> umops: sky123: I need to get some sleep soon, will you guys be here tomorrow?
[11:16] <Alzi2> Hmmm... I have to admit, Fluxbox is nice
[11:16] <Alzi2> it detects all the apps
[11:16] <unimatrix9> hee Alzi2 nederlands?
[11:16] <Alzi2> yup :)
[11:16] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder ls -l /home/mouser/.kde
[11:16] <unimatrix9> leuk!
[11:16] <Alzi2> haha :P niet hier, though. mag niet
[11:16] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder you tell us
[11:16] <unimatrix9> waar woon je>
[11:16] <umops> Jordan_U, maybe :)
[11:16] <sky123> Jordan_U: yeah...my wife wont talk to me like this..so..yeah..
[11:16] <sky123> lol
[11:16] <dsb> well I'm a dumbass
[11:16] <unimatrix9> ik tilburg
[11:16] <Alzi2> zeg ik niet
[11:16] <unimatrix9> hhehe
[11:17] <sky123> dsb: too much beer and looking for majic picks
[11:17] <Alzi2> Well, anyways..
[11:17] <dsb> I was running apt-get from a machine that was logged into my other machine
[11:17] <unimatrix9> like fluxbox so far?
[11:17] <Alzi2> yeah :)
[11:17] <unimatrix9> is everything faster?
[11:17] <pfred1> Alzi2 ain't Linux great?
[11:17] <sky123> dsb: happens all the time..
[11:17] <dsb> lol
[11:17] <Oswyn> does anyone know of a command line program to send mail using a remote smtp server?
[11:17] <unimatrix9> choice choice..
[11:17] <pfred1> can't change your window manager that easy with the other stuff
[11:17] <mexp> Bump.. Mount problem, anyone can help??
[11:18] <mats> Alzi2: (-: did it solve your problem?
[11:18] <dsb> so now this machine has all kinds of cool stuff installed that I wanted on the other one
[11:18] <dsb> lol
[11:18] <defrysk> Alzi2, is nederlands ?
[11:18] <CorpseFeeder> don't ask me.. I just let synaptic install it. If synaptic wants to create folders with no write permissions, that's its fault. Now how do I change permissions on this app so it will run?
[11:18] <mats> Alzi2: GNU is the best thing <3
[11:18] <Alzi2> pfred1: Sure is.
[11:18] <defrysk> !nl Alzi2

[11:19] <pfred1> Alzi2 but the bigger window managers are resource pigs good place to start trimming down
[11:19] <Jordan_U> umops: sky123: Thanks to both of you, I was just going to assume it was impossible, I didn't actually expect help here :) ( now hopefully they will decide to use more OSS if I can get this working after they have spent a week hacking at nt4 :)
[11:19] <sky123> Jordan_U: it is possible..and id try  umops ideas..and see where it blows up...cant hurt
[11:20] <Cosmonaut3030> Why does installing debian debs on ubuntu break your system?
[11:20] <umops> Jordan_U, that sounds great.   If you have the power to convert them thats super :)

[11:20] <pfred1> xmms is a slob
[11:20] <Cosmonaut3030> and it's dead, isn't it?
[11:20] <Alzi2> and a good terminal?
[11:20] <pfred1> was always a resource hound
[11:21] <CorpseFeeder> how do I fix the permissions on this /home/mouser/.kde folder so I can write? is it chown something....?
[11:21] <mats> Alzi2: aterm is the hotest
[11:21] <Jordan_U> umops: I am not really clear on what you suggested I do, were you reffering to one of the conversion scripts out there ?
[11:21] <unimatrix9> or mplayer on the command line ( could do the trick too eh? )
[11:21] <pfred1> rxvt
[11:21] <we2by> how can enlightement is no the repo??
[11:21] <Cosmonaut3030> If you want tabs in your terms, use Konsole or Gnome-term
[11:21] <dsb> sky123: can I ask you some more domain general questions?
[11:21] <mats> pfred1: rxvt is oldschool ;)
[11:21] <pfred1> unimatrix9 well if mplayer isn't on the CLI then it's gmplayer :)
[11:22] <compengi> i'm using samba it was working fine 2 days ago but today i tried to enter network servers it doesn't display the workgroup name =/
[11:22] <Alzi2> mats: and a terminal font?
[11:22] <compengi> i tried to restart it but without any result
[11:22] <pfred1> mats 11 years and here i still am
[11:22] <Jordan_U> we2by: Because it is?
[11:22] <Alzi2> unimatrix9: and videos?
[11:22] <we2by> Jordan_U: it  is?
[11:22] <Cosmonaut3030> Use mplayer for video
[11:22] <Cosmonaut3030> It's the best player
[11:22] <Jordan_U> !info enlightenment
[11:22] <ubotu> enlightenment: The Enlightenment Window Manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 1:0.16.7.2-3ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 380 kB, installed size 980 kB
[11:22] <mats> pfred1: ;) impressiv
[11:22] <unimatrix9> mplayer , start it from command line shell
[11:22] <pfred1> just use mplayer
[11:22] <sky123> dsb: ill try and answer...im learning just like you..
[11:22] <umops> Jordan_U, sorry i mean converting the other guys you work with to open source :)
[11:22] <Alzi2> ok
[11:22] <Alzi2> and a nice terminal font for aterm?
[11:23] <we2by> oh, typed the wrong name
[11:23] <pfred1> it can play /dev/urandom if you pipe it to it
[11:23] <pfred1> or any other multimedia format yo uthrow at it
[11:23] <Jordan_U> we2by: You may also need to enable the universe repo.
[11:23] <pfred1> it does streams too
[11:23] <Jordan_U> umops: I got that, I meant before that, with just try something and see what errors I get?
[11:24] <dsb> it seems to be common to use url's such as ftp://ftp.domain.com for ftp transfers
[11:24] <unimatrix9> monospace or something
[11:24] <mats> Alzi2: you have too try it out yourself
=== Raskall is now known as paps
[11:24] <we2by> Jordan_U: how do I get the latest beta release of Enlightenment?
[11:24] <dsb> so I would need my dns to records to add ftp.mydomain.com (especially the ftp part?)
=== paps is now known as Raskall
[11:24] <sky123> dsb: yep
[11:24] <mats> we2by: you seek the webpage
[11:24] <CorpseFeeder> what's the command to change permissions on a folder.. I forget? how do I enable write permission on a folder?
[11:24] <Alzi2> mats: On Arch Linux i've always used terminus. how to install that in Ubuntu?
[11:25] <dsb> ok I thought so
[11:25] <Cosmonaut3030> CorpseFeeder: chown user file
[11:25] <sky123> dsb: that is exactly it
[11:25] <dsb> thanks
[11:25] <scorp007> why am i missing certain manpages? like man time.h man math.h etc?
[11:25] <sky123> dsb: just point it to the same ip
[11:25] <scorp007> i have man 3 printf  though?
[11:25] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder chmod
[11:25] <umops> Jordan_U, I dont know of any tools that will convert the database for you.  I don't know if it will even need converting.  So run the backup/recovery script in mysql and see what the errors are, and then look at the easiest way to fix it.
[11:25] <atzar> I have contrast/brightness problems with totem, what can I do ?
[11:25] <mats> Alzi2: apt-cache search terminus see if its on the apt-tree
[11:26] <sky123> dsb: and then portforward to an ftp box or the same one if you wish and enable ftp server
[11:26] <we2by> what's the difference between xfce4 and xfwm4?
[11:26] <CorpseFeeder> is it chmod or chown? I can never remember which to use?
[11:26] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder some good file managers let yo uchange file perms too
[11:26] <sky123> dsb: ftp can be dangerous..if you f up and set it up wrong so..read up.
[11:26] <Cosmonaut3030> chown. Change owner.
[11:26] <defrysk> chmod +rw
[11:26] <Jordan_U> umops: OK, will do, thanks.
[11:26] <pfred1> CorpseFeeder well any good file manager should let you change a file's permissions
[11:26] <defrysk> or chown
[11:26] <we2by> !xfce
[11:26] <ubotu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with XFCE, for more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org  To install from Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[11:26] <defrysk> man chown man chmod
[11:26] <pfred1> or it's just not that good a file manager now is it?
[11:27] <dsb> ya thats why I was asking around about ftp earlier, but ...
[11:27] <sky123> dsb: i think there is sufficient info on vsftpd
[11:27] <dsb> so I'm toying with it locally before I let open up to my other scallions
[11:27] <Jordan_U> CorpseFeeder: Just remember, chown is CHange OWNer and chmod is the other one :)
[11:27] <pfred1> so why did they call it Ubuntu anyways and not simply Debian done right?
[11:28] <Cosmonaut3030> CHMOD is CHange MODifications
[11:28] <sky123> dsb: right..
[11:28] <pfred1> chmod (1)            - change file access permissions
[11:28] <unimatrix9> becuase ubuntu is made from debian sources, but is not debian
[11:28] <dsb> I should just teach them ssh and scp
[11:28] <roryy> Cosmonaut3030: change mode, i think
[11:28] <mats> pfred1: hehe
[11:28] <Cosmonaut3030> Oh right. Thanks.
[11:28] <dsb> and sftp
[11:28] <pfred1> unimatrix9 thank God for that!
[11:28] <sky123> pfred1: cause the ubuntu means a whole lot more! its the philosophy too.
[11:28] <Cosmonaut3030> Ubuntu is great and all... but it's full of stupid shit
[11:28] <roryy> heh
[11:29] <pfred1> sky123 ones and zeros don't have any philosophy
[11:29] <bobby> hi
[11:29] <madewokherd> like chmod?
[11:29] <madewokherd> that's kind of important, you know
[11:29] <pfred1> my OS shouldn't have a philosophy either!
[11:29] <unimatrix9> i think its the oposite, debian is much more, for more platforms then just i386
[11:29] <Hoxx> i cant really figure out the color preferences in xchat, anyone has a guide to it?
[11:29] <CaptainMorgan> is there collapseable regions option in gedit?
[11:29] <Jordan_U> sky123: the philosophy to instlall binary blobs by default ? ;)
[11:29] <sky123> pfred1: the use of those ones and zeros for a purpose thats different
[11:29] <Cosmonaut3030> pfred1: yes it should. other wise you would be paying for this.
[11:29] <pfred1> my hammer in my garage doesn't have a philosophy
[11:30] <VigoFusion> Is the chmod/chown things used in Synaptic? like can I access or reset them using Synaptic?
[11:30] <unimatrix9> it does, use it to slamm nails
[11:30] <unimatrix9> :P
[11:30] <pfred1> Cosmonaut3030 I get tools for free
[11:30] <Cosmonaut3030> Yeah, it does. You bought your hammer and have the right to use it for whatever
[11:30] <Jordan_U> pfred1: Doesn't have SSH either.
[11:30] <pfred1> no I get lots of hammers for free
[11:30] <Cosmonaut3030> wtf?
[11:30] <sky123> oh well..didnt mean to open up a can...of worms..
[11:31] <roryy> VigoFusion: no. you can access file permissions through Nautilus (the file browser, though).  Places -> Home, right-click on a file and choose the permissions tab
[11:31] <pfred1> computers and OSes are simply tools
[11:31] <sky123> just watch the video..with nelson mandella..then send him email
[11:31] <pfred1> nothing more nothing less
[11:31] <Jordan_U> can't ssh into worm cans either...
[11:31] <defrysk> VigoFusion, chmod and chown are done in the cli however also properties of a file can be changed in nautilus by rightklicking it
[11:31] <kai_> good morning community! ive got problems getting my sinus 154 wlan device working on edgy eft. has everyone time to help me?
[11:31] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[11:31] <unimatrix9> there seems to be an package called consule-terminus
[11:31] <Jordan_U> OK, I officially need to go to sleep, goodnight all.
[11:31] <unimatrix9> so apt-get install console-terminus would install these fonts
[11:31] <pfred1> don't be a tool thinking they are philosophy!
[11:31] <dsb> ya I'm kind of bothered about the philosphy thing too, but it's still linux
[11:32] <mats> Jordan_U: night
[11:32] <pfred1> Linus doesn't look at it that way
[11:32] <sky123> Jordan-U: good luck
[11:32] <pfred1> he knows they're just tools
[11:32] <pfred1> heck he'll evne wun Windows if it is the best for the job
[11:32] <AndiM> Just wanted to mention that www.ubuntu.com doesn't even have a language selector available. This is what I'd call entirely and fully useless. Already mailed to webmaster@, hopefully this is a valid address (no website feedback path obvious either!!)
[11:32] <Cosmonaut3030> Linus doesn't care for the GPL
[11:32] <dsb> Linus tools around on a computer all day long, I don't
[11:33] <xabbott> If I installed Ubuntu with hyperthreading off and I turn it on. Will it auto detect upon next boot?
[11:33] <pfred1> dsb nah he drinks heavily too!
[11:33] <Jordan_U> AndiM: You should file a bug on launchpad, there is a section for the website.
[11:33] <mats> Linus cares about GPL
[11:33] <Cosmonaut3030> Linus sees himself as an engineer, not a prophet/religious figure
[11:33] <gill> hello all
[11:33] <pfred1> yup a tool creator and user
[11:33] <Alzi2> pfred1: Do you know of a good GTK theme switch tool + font switching?
[11:34] <lastnode> Cosmonaut3030, mats : that's for #ubuntu-offtopic please
[11:34] <pfred1> Alzi2 I don't mess with theming I like things plain
[11:34] <Cosmonaut3030> ok
[11:34] <defrysk> !ot
[11:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:34] <pfred1> Alzi2 although i do prefer some fonts over others
[11:34] <defrysk> geez
[11:34] <Alzi2> pfred1: at least the font size
[11:34] <mats> lastnode: ;)
[11:35] <pfred1> Alzi2 in what application do you wish to change the font?
[11:35] <Alzi2> all GTK apps
[11:35] <gill> I have an mp3 problem, a voice recorder creates corrupt wav files. and while totem will play them; noting else will convert them or brn them to disc
[11:35] <Cosmonaut3030> Does anyone know why frozen-bubble doesn't fullscreen properly? Anyone else get this?
[11:35] <pfred1> Alzi2 oh well if it is just size you can mess with how X Window starts with the dpi switch
[11:35] <Alzi2> pfred1: 96 DPI - how?
[11:36] <pfred1> --dpi 96
[11:36] <Ayabara> is there a batch renamer for gnome that can do what krename does in kde?
[11:36] <pfred1> I htink been a while
[11:36] <Alzi2> pfred1: Where to put that?
[11:36] <pfred1> might be -dpi
[11:36] <pfred1> I think it defaults to what 72 ?
[11:36] <Cosmonaut3030> Ayabara: I don't know, but I think THunar has a bulk rename app.
[11:36] <Alzi2>   resolution:    108x113 dots per inch
[11:36] <AndiM> Jordan_U: ah, thanks! hmm, typing "webmaster" into Search box directed me to a page for general Ubuntu feedback (including webmaster), but it cannot be found easily anywhere from the main page.
[11:37] <pfred1> Alzi2 that would be awfully small wouldn't it?
[11:37] <Ayabara> Cosmonaut3030, ok. come to think of it I think I only need an app that can rename imagefiles using exif date
[11:37] <pfred1> Alzi2 with a gdm I don't know where you change the default dpi but I'd look into that if I were you
[11:38] <pfred1> Alzi2  108x113 dpi is well excessive to me
[11:39] <AndiM> pfred1: default font dpi is a property of the X server, I'd say!?
[11:40] <pfred1> AndiM when i changed it I started from the console init 3 and just did it on the startx command with the -dpi switch
[11:40] <unimatrix9> Alzi2 are you doing linux programming?
[11:40] <pfred1> AndiM it took me quite some time to be comfortable with gdms and I never bothered finding out very much about that
[11:40] <AndiM> there's a way to auto-detect the display characteristics, but it can be configured in xorg.conf, too.
[11:41] <pfred1> today X is so stable i don't worry about my system not coming up
[11:42] <AndiM> pfred1: well, X is "stable", but what if you have graphics card/driver issues? Then there still isn't a good fallback mechanism, right?
[11:42] <pfred1> AndiM ctrl + alt + F2 I guess
[11:42] <we2by> does xfwm4 themes work for xubuntu?
[11:42] <talkIRC> my linux box is now up and running with online ability thanks for all the help guys
[11:43] <AndiM> X config still is very arcane and not flexible, unless this has changed recently with some x.org work.
[11:43] <comicinker> hi
[11:43] <Alzi2> Fixed that one =)
[11:43] <pfred1> heh i got the oreilly X Window book set
[11:43] <pfred1> have flipped though them a few times too
[11:43] <Alzi2> pfred1: who was that other person I was speaking to in dutch? :P
[11:43] <AndiM> pfred1: uh, yeah, but that certainly isn't John Doe friendly ;)
[11:43] <comicinker> i've a problem installing faad2 or using autoreconf:
[11:43] <comicinker> autoreconf: failed to run aclocal: No such file or directory
[11:44] <unimatrix9> Alzi2 are you interested in linux community meetings?
[11:44] <pfred1> Alzi2 I think they gone they were ones who didn't have write perms to their ~/.kde dir I htink
[11:44] <Alzi2> unimatrix9: no. I am 14 :P
[11:44] <AndiM> comicinker: "apt-cache search auto"? Probaby some specific autoconf/automake/autoSomething package missing?
[11:44] <unimatrix9> oh
[11:44] <unimatrix9> hehe
[11:45] <unimatrix9> then you are an really early adopter!
[11:45] <luca__> hi everyone
[11:45] <Alzi2> Heh. thanks, i guess?
[11:45] <comicinker> it's always apt-get. I should learn somehow sometime!
[11:45] <pfred1> yeah i didn't start using Linux til I was like 32
[11:45] <defrysk> sign of intelligence Alzi2
[11:45] <unimatrix9> by the way, my son is ten years old and uses an linux desktop :)
[11:45] <we2by> any one knows how to install themes for xfce4?
[11:45] <AndiM> I've been adopting Linux when I was 19... 11 years ago ;)
[11:45] <luca__> does anyone know how to make function/remove gaim 2 beta 5?
[11:45] <defrysk> my 14 jr old son refuses to show any interst in linux
[11:45] <Alzi2> defrysk: Heh, thanks =)
[11:45] <talkIRC> (away) (reason) gotta sleep sometime or another

=== talkIRC-zzz is now known as talkIRC
[11:46] <umops> sky123, Oh dear...lol
[11:46] <pfred1> they'll get interested real fast then
[11:46] <Alzi2> too bad it doesn't work correctly on Arch Linux
[11:46] <talkIRC> (back) (reason) gotta sleep sometime or another (duration) 16secs
[11:46] <pfred1> defrysk you seen the new Vista license yet?
[11:46] <unimatrix9> nice tool that removes drm,,,
[11:46] <defrysk> pfred1, I am not interested in vista
[11:46] <pfred1> they'll let you transfer the OS to one other system and thats it
[11:47] <defrysk> or theyr policies
[11:47] <pfred1> after that your'e trotting off to the store to buy another copy
[11:47] <pfred1> defrysk I haven't run Windows since win95 but I am still interested in what everyone else is up to
[11:47] <unimatrix9> i hate vendor lockins..
[11:48] <defrysk> pfred1, i only run it to fox other peoples probs with windows
[11:48] <defrysk> fix*
[11:48] <unimatrix9> fact - windows vista will bring back , that old feeling off the blue screen you loved so much ...
[11:48] <defrysk> anyway , all off topic
[11:48] <pfred1> the other day I was looking at a box that ran windows ME gawd!
[11:48] <pfred1> now i know what people mean when they talk about that stuff
[11:49] <sky123> umops: Im glad I stopped that...they woulda had a bitch of a time dealing with us in here...lol
[11:49] <Alzi2> pfred1: Okay, so I installed aterm, beep-media-player, mplayer, fluxbox, and what more alternatives are there?
[11:49] <pfred1> Playskool is more mature an interface
[11:49] <Alzi2> pfred1: And how to get rid of the annoying GNOME entries in my menu?
[11:49] <AndiM> Alzi2: xine? vlc?
[11:49] <pfred1> Alzi2 I never used fluxbox so don't know how their menu is edited
[11:50] <pfred1> Alzi2 I'm a Windowmaker kinda a guy
[11:50] <pfred1> it has nice menu editor
[11:50] <Alzi2> hmm
[11:50] <pfred1> used Windowmaker since versin .14
[11:51] <pfred1> when the lead left their part time contribs of Afterstep
[11:51] <niru> Alzi2:Any icon zooming package in gnome
[11:51] <unimatrix9> Alzi2 why dont you leave the entries there, you might need them someday..
[11:51] <pfred1> I left with them :)
[11:51] <Alzi2> unimatrix9: maybe, yes...
[11:52] <pfred1> sloppy menus can be annoying
[11:52] <unimatrix9> any way, here is an read to the menu thing

[11:56] <smoenux> bhudda: a Hidden file has a period before the filename
[11:56] <pfred1> AndiM where like the midranges drop out
[11:57] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: mixer? what exactly is a mixer? An other sound controlling application? (If thats the right term...)
[11:57] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: run speaker-test -c 6 to verify channels. But this doesn't work for my card either (swapped channels, ALSA will have to cope with this rather frequent issue somehow, soon)

[11:58] <smoenux> bhudda: also, if you are using nautilus, you can press, ctrl + H, and that will show hidden files in Nautilus
[11:58] <mngrif> i'm actually trying to grok the source to ubiquity to see if i can just comment out the check
[11:58] <bunnythebunny> AndiM:  well, this is odd. i can only hear the left and right speakers in the test. When using sound applications i can only hear the central and right.
[11:58] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: oooooh... I'm afraid I need to talk a bit more higher-level then ;) a "mixer" is an app to modify sound volume levels of various sound sources/destinations.
[11:59] <sky123> umops: sheesh...i  wanna meet her a bar......NOT
[11:59] <pfred1> and alsa likes to mute some things by default
[11:59] <pfred1> like doesn't alsa start up totally muted?
[12:00] <AndiM> pfred1: yup, to protect boxes from exploding. ;)
[12:00] <pfred1> AndiM still freaks people out when they're like where's my sound?
[12:00] <umops> sky123, haha, she really doesn't get it.  Anyway, I'm off.
[12:00] <VigoFusion> Live HD casts stream doesnt function, is it the WMA junk? or I need to add codecs?
[12:01] <Somazx> I'm trying to install edgy on an intel imac, but after the ubuntu splash screen the video gets wiggy
[12:01] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: please try modifying volume sliders etc. in various sound mixer applications, that might help. But like I said, ALSA does have some issues with surround on certain cards, it seems.
[12:01] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: :P ah i see.  I'll try to get an other mixer then. By the way, when testing the sound thats supossed to come out the speakers is...a sort of...."pFffffffffffffffffffff" right?
[12:01] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: yup, normal white noise.
[12:01] <pfred1> yeah there's an ubuntu specific problem i have on my Ubuntu box come to think about it on that box when it goes into screen saver the screen gets torn horizontally
[12:01] <unimatrix9> live HD casts, it depends on the source where you get it from, so if they offer it with or without
[12:02] <sky123> umops: I really dont get people.. having a title of "woman" doesnt entitle her to sympathy..weird
[12:02] <pfred1> I just got used to it though but it does give me a headache to look at
[12:02] <unimatrix9> live HD casts, mplayer can play some, but has troubles with others, you neeed codecs anyway
[12:02] <Somazx> is there a way to install from the shell - I can hit ctrl-alt-F1 and access that fine
[12:02] <pfred1> doesn't X Window detach F1 ?
[12:02] <VigoFusion> unimatrix9: The source is WUWF Public Radio.
[12:03] <unimatrix9> Somazx, apt-get?
[12:03] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: if you don't get it to work with simple mixer adjustment, then you might want to think about upgrading ALSA related packages to the latest version in this particular Ubuntu distro. Or even upgrade the kernel in case that's an easy thing to do.
[12:03] <archangelpetro> has anyone had any problems with the command 'sudo nvidia-glx-config enable' after install nvidia-glx?
[12:03] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: Ah good. Well, the thing is AndiM, i did manage to put surround to work through this file in a gentoo wiki (surround gentoo wiki..somthing like that) but what happens is that even though all speakers do work, a crackling noise comes about now and then, interrupting aplications everytime it cracks.
[12:03] <sky123> umops: dont answer that...
[12:03] <unimatrix9> is that hd channel 2?
[12:04] <hossi> hey
[12:04] <VigoFusion> I tried both
=== dark_ is now known as dark_light
[12:04] <archangelpetro> im curious as to why apt-getting nvidia-glx doesnt work...?
[12:04] <unimatrix9> i can play it over here, it opens in totem
[12:04] <pfred1> AndiM ALSA is sponsered by SuSE right?
[12:04] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: i think i've got the latest. And the kernel is 2.6...i don't know if i can go further than that..
[12:05] <VigoFusion> Ok thank you, I will give that a shot
[12:05] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: most likely cause and effect reversed: it cracks when there's an issue that *also* pauses other applications.
[12:05] <unimatrix9> okey
[12:05] <smoenux> archangelpetro: do you have the right repos?
[12:05] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: not enough RAM? lots of harddisk activity? system overloaded?
[12:05] <Alzi2> Can anybody recommend me a good, cpu-friendly bittorrent client?
[12:06] <pfred1> Alzi2 I use the cli one
[12:06] <archangelpetro> smoenux, yea.. ive installed nvidia-glx but when i do the command to 'nvidia-glx-config enable' i get the following error : Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[12:06] <archangelpetro> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[12:06] <bunnythebunny> Don't think so..i've got 1024 ram..and enough swap...
[12:06] <teledyn_> Alzi2: bittornado
[12:06] <archangelpetro> but im not sure how to resolve the issue
[12:06] <hossi> can I play .asx in totem?
[12:06] <bunnythebunny> Andim Don't think so..i've got 1024 ram..and enough swap...
[12:06] <unimatrix9> okey have to go, battery low ( used it for three  hours now ) ..
[12:06] <Alzi2> pfred1: Wow... amazing, now i'm in Fluxbox, even apt-get is a lot faster, even in the console.. weird...
[12:06] <unimatrix9> bye all, have an nice day, and happy tuxing!
[12:06] <smoenux> archangelpetro: there is a great howto on the net... lemme get it for you quick
[12:06] <bhudda> smoenux, can you tell me what I need to do with this? glGo: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL_image-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:07] <pfred1> Alzi2 yeah i wish gnome would just go away there are a lot of nice gnome apps though
[12:07] <mngrif> *gasp* fluxbox eats a meg of ram!
[12:07] <Alzi2> okay, i have bittornado.. and now what?
[12:07] <bunnythebunny> AndiM my harddisk seems to be ok, and i dont know if the systems overloaded, its not cause of what im doing for sure. I barely have anything working here. just the main ubuntu things, gaim, and utorrent.
[12:07] <lastnode> Alzi2, er, there is no way that is possible
[12:07] <lastnode> :-)
[12:07] <archangelpetro> smoenux, i followed the howto install nvidia drivers.. and i followed it to the letter as far as i'm aware.. not sure why that happened though (I've installed them before on XUBUNTU so ..?)
[12:07] <smoenux> bhudda: O.o --- lol... no idea what that even means
[12:07] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: then *maybe* it's an issue with a driver that fails to work properly, either because of system misconfiguration or because it's buggy.
[12:07] <Alzi2> lastnode: Well, i'm seeing it for myself, aren't i? So yes, it is possible./
[12:07] <Alzi2> On the (Reading database...) section, I always had to wait 1 minute or so. Now it's 1 second =)
[12:08] <bhudda> smoenux, haha, thanks then...I forced installed a 32 bit app to my 64 and now I can't figure out how to get this lib to be found or read by this app....argh!
[12:08] <lastnode> Alzi2, well, it's probably psychological, because fluxbox is just a GUI, and apt-get is still the same CLI program that you ran under your previous window manager. :-)
[12:08] <hossi> can I play .asx in totem?
[12:08] <Jamesrose> Yes
[12:08] <bhudda> I don't even know if I have it...I have tried to find it with aptitude...
[12:08] <VigoFusion> says Totem cannot play, hrmmm
[12:08] <Alzi2> lastnode: heh.
[12:08] <Jamesrose> Hmm
[12:08] <Jamesrose> Try Movie Player
[12:09] <hossi> movie player?
[12:09] <pfred1> with ubuntu in order for me to access a lot of the distro config tools i still fire up gnome in order to access them
[12:09] <Jamesrose> Mplayer
[12:09] <mngrif> bhudda: did you run ldconfig?
[12:09] <Jamesrose> apt-get install mplayer
[12:09] <bhudda> How do you change default apps for files?
[12:09] <Alzi2> how to configure bittornado?
[12:09] <bunnythebunny> AndiM urgh the possibilities are so vast..it makes me just want to go and buy a new motherboard. But i don't think it could be the system itself thats causing the crackling effects. i've tested it both ways...when im going around without the .asoundrc file i got from the gentoo wiki, and with it removed. And when its removed my sound never makes crackling noises, although only the centre and right speakers work.
[12:09] <bhudda> mgrif, no i haven't i will try that now
[12:09] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: check /proc/interrupts whether too many drivers share one IRQ.
[12:09] <mngrif> bhudda: just run it on it's own, as root
[12:10] <comicinker> hi!
[12:10] <archangelpetro> smoenux, is the link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia ?
[12:10] <smoenux> arhangelpetro: do you have Nvidia-settings? if so, goto: 'OpenGL/GLX Information' and check if Direct Rendering is Yes
[12:10] <KenSentMe> bhudda: right click on a file (like avi), select open with and define the default app
[12:10] <bunnythebunny> AndiM the IRQ is the thing at the left, right?
[12:10] <bhudda> mngrif, I ran it with "sudo ldconfig" and then tried to run glGo, same error readout
[12:10] <smoenux> archangelpetro: Dapper or Edgy ?
[12:10] <KenSentMe> bhudda: sorry, first open properties
[12:10] <archangelpetro> 6.10 (edgy)
[12:11] <mngrif> bhudda: dunno then
[12:11] <comicinker> i got a problem with dpkg and pmk:
[12:11] <comicinker> sub-process post-instalation returned erreor 1
[12:11] <bunnythebunny> AndiM, i mean, the column :P
[12:11] <bhudda> Dang...lol
[12:11] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: might be an issue with ALC850 support itself. Or check out http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000066
[12:11] <comicinker> can anyone help?
[12:11] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: yup, left column.
[12:12] <smoenux> archangelpetro: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/BerylOnEdgy
[12:12] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: if its the left column, there is no IRQ shared.
[12:12] <smoenux> archangelpetro: that has a nice howto for nvidia driver also
[12:12] <archangelpetro> smoenux, i'll try it.. thanks very much mate :)
[12:13] <smoenux> archangelpetro: but before you go ahead...
[12:13] <smoenux> archangelpetro: try adding this repo also
[12:13] <bunnythebunny> AndiM http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32718/ see for yourself
[12:14] <archangelpetro> ok,
[12:14] <comicinker> so nobody can help me with my dpkg problem?
[12:14] <smoenux> archangelpetro: http://amaranth.selfip.com edgy lrm
[12:14] <Yasuo> hi, since i installed ubuntu 6.10, i cannot use the arrow keys in rox-filer's listing mode
[12:15] <smoenux> archangelpetro: if you go to the ubuntu-xgl chatroom, amaranth is usually there, and he knows how to fix the probs etc. He helped me with my XGL
[12:15] <RiGLEY> The steps to compile a program from source is: ./compile, make, make install        right?
[12:15] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: hmm, and where is the ALC850 IRQ? I cannot see anything there...
[12:15] <heryann> ok
[12:15] <RiGLEY> i mean ./configure
[12:15] <archangelpetro> smoenux, thanks dude i'll do that :) (btw the repository should be added to sources.list as-is?)
[12:16] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: try this page linked from the other page, http://www.flaterco.com/kb/audio.html
[12:16] <smoenux> archangelpetro: yeah
[12:16] <smoenux> archangelpetro: no authentication needed
[12:16] <archangelpetro> k
[12:16] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: thats all there is.
[12:16] <mngrif> (i'll try this the n00b way) can someone help with an installation problem?:
[12:16] <bunnythebunny> AndiM, im already on it
[12:17] <archangelpetro> dont i need 'deb ' infront of it first?
[12:17] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: strange, I'd assume ALC850 to require an IRQ??
[12:18] <AndiM> mngrif: specifics, please ;)
[12:18] <archangelpetro> smoenux, dont i need 'deb ' infront of it ?
[12:18] <sky123> comicinker: doing a google search against that string...yields a potential bug in what ever it is that you are trying to install. there are of course suggestions there for what you are installing..what in particular did you try to install??
[12:18] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: I hate to act newbish but honestly i have no idea.
[12:19] <mngrif> AndiM: gave out specifics 10 minutes ago :P in short ubiquity is saying i don't have a root partition selected when i do infact have one selected. apparently it wants the "reformat" box checked on whatever i pick as /. this is with 6.10
[12:19] <mngrif> AndiM: and the livecd won't use /etc/resolv.conf
[12:19] <archangelpetro> oh btw smoenux I'm afraid i did forget to mention that i'm on amd64 if that makes a diff :P
[12:20] <AndiM> mngrif: does that partition have wrong existing filesystem? ext3, reiser, resier4, xfs, jfs, ...?
[12:20] <pfred1> reiserM
[12:20] <mngrif> AndiM: it's ext3, clean, but it does have data i can't backup, so i can't reformat it
[12:21] <bhudda> Ok so here's my dillema, I need the libSDL_image1.2 library. But it isn't listed in aptitude...if I can find it somewhere on the net that is tar how do I install it?
[12:21] <smoenux> archangelpetro: yeah... I do too, but I installed the i386 edgy neway :P, I'm a bit cautious of the 64bit dirstro's :P dunno why ?

[12:29] <AndiM> mngrif: we need heroes such as you and me to save the world *smirk*
[12:29] <mngrif> AndiM: " Since you must reformat the root file system for use by the installer in any case, you can easily work around this problem by deleting and re-creating the partition in question in the advanced partitioner." what kind of crap is this?!
[12:29] <smoenux> amicke: in your system menu, preferences you will find the emerald theme manager, as well as the beryl-settings manager
[12:29] <mngrif> AndiM: oh i assure you, i save the world from M$, one day at a time, one computer at a time....
[12:29] <amicke> yes i have found those :)

[12:31] <bhudda> can you install .rpm files with ubuntu?
[12:31] <bhudda> if so, how?
[12:31] <bunnythebunny> AndiM, I hate to bother with this but.. "Install kernel version 2.6.12.2 or newer. The correct ALSA driver should be enabled by default. Using version 2.6.12.2 from kernel.org, the relevant checkbox in make menuconfig is Device Drivers  Sound  Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  PCI devices  Intel/SiS/nVidia/AMD/ALi AC97 Controller."  ....where the hell is "make menuconfig"?

[12:33] <shadowsong> andim: i tried it too. i dled a package but i couldnt open Amsn package with "sh" command
[12:34] <Keyseir> !moin
[12:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:34] <smoenux> amicke: I had some unexpected results with beryl, so I'm always a bit cautious. If I change monitors or resolution, funny things start happening. so I only activate it once I've set up my nvidia-settings. Otherwise I experience odd XGL crashes O.o
[12:34] <bunnythebunny> AndiM hehe, I probably just should jump to the lower part of the page.
[12:35] <smoenux> amicke: It's working fine for me atm
[12:35] <shadowsong> andim: do you know a way to download an Amsn package and install it with tk and tcl?
[12:35] <AndiM> shadowsong: hmm. download .deb package, move to /home/USER/ directory, open terminal, become root, dpkg -i amsn*.deb
[12:35] <shadowsong> andi

[12:37] <Be-Box> does someone know if there is a driver for linux ati radeon x1800gto ???
[12:38] <shadowsong> andim: i have foumd also an ubuntu-type package of Amsn.should i choose ubuntu? or deb package?
[12:38] <AndiM> shadowsong: depends on which distro you're using.
[12:38] <Be-Box> does someone know if there is a driver for linux ati radeon x1800gto ???
[12:39] <shadowsong> andim: i have ubuntu 6.10 edgy eft.but i coulndt run it by installing with synaptic.
[12:39] <AndiM> Be-Box: your only question is whether the standard x.org "radeon" driver supports it, or whether the proprietary ATI x.org driver supports it.
[12:39] <smoenux> amicke, how can I share the printscreen with you, imageshack ?
[12:39] <amicke> ya

[12:40] <amicke> smoenux: http://img169.imageshack.us
[12:40] <mngrif> abo: perhaps an opengl screensaver and no opengl support?
[12:40] <AndiM> abo: run "top" in terminal to find out.
[12:41] <Be-Box> well...
[12:41] <Be-Box> I can't get it to work... :-)
[12:41] <shadowsong> andim: i tried it with synaptic manager but it gave me errors.now if i go manually install Amsn,should i choose ubuntu package or another one?
[12:41] <Be-Box> so i guess that my question is how to do that
[12:42] <AndiM> shadowsong: then the question would be: which errors?
[12:42] <smoenux> amicke, uploading now, nothing special there, i installed the eXperience icons, which is quite nice
[12:42] <shadowsong> andim: "illegal instruction" when i run amsn in console
[12:42] <AndiM> shadowsong: ah, I thought you meant errors when installing different version.
[12:43] <Keyseir> Anyone here experienced with vmware?
[12:43] <TrendKi||> Keyseir, maye...whats the question?
[12:43] <dcordes> how can i mount a remote ssh folder?
[12:43] <niru> Keyseir:do you know any icon zooming package in gnome
[12:43] <Be-Box> AndiM: I guess the question is how to get it to work... <i downloaded the Ati support from the internet and nothing happened. :-/
[12:43] <amicke> smoenux: ok, nice. jsut post me the link so i can have a look :)
[12:43] <shadowsong> andim: i havent seen such an error before.is it a compatiblity issue?ot 3rd part source list?
[12:44] <AndiM> Be-Box: did you check /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
=== elate1 is now known as elate
[12:44] <Be-Box> AndiM: what do you mean check?
[12:44] <Chetic> Why can't any of my applications connect to the sound server since I crashed?
[12:44] <AndiM> shadowsong: it could be just about anything, very generic error. "Illegal instruction" points to invalid binary image or so.
[12:44] <smoenux> amicke: this should be it: http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/9919/screenshotok0.png
[12:45] <AndiM> Be-Box: for WWarnings or EErrors, that is.
[12:45] <Keyseir> niru: Can't think of anything that does that, but I may not understand the question well enough
[12:45] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, I'm running ubuntu linux edgy. Just got a weird error with vmware and I think it happend when the computer went to sleep. I came back and everything was frozen and I couldn't even click into it. I got some weird syslogd messages at the time that the computer probably went to sleep. http://pastebin.com/827979
[12:46] <shadowsong> AndiM: i searched web.and i found issues only about tcl 8.5 and tk 8.5.i didnt see illegal instruction error.what do you think?
[12:46] <amicke> smoenux: nice, lots of effects :)
[12:46] <Be-Box> AndiM: I am saying that I downloaded the package and don't know how to start it... My guess is that there are no errors
[12:46] <Heretic42> Hello! ANyone with wifi expertise here? :)
[12:47] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, incidently, guest os is xp
[12:47] <AndiM> Heretic42: driver developer here, but I don't feel like starting yet another support item with another person ;)
[12:47] <smoenux> amicke: thx ^.^ .... you can change the transparency of a window fast by holding down ALT while scrolling the mouse on the window
[12:48] <Be-Box> AndiM: linux didn't recognize my grafic card....it says unknown
[12:48] <TrendKi||> Keyseir, sorry, no clue what might have happened
[12:48] <amicke> smoenux: ok, nice... do you know how i can change the shadow on windows?
[12:48] <smoenux> amicke: also, open Lots of windows, and play with F8 and F9, very handy
[12:48] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, Thanks for looking over. DId you look at the pastebin? I have no idea what that syslogd stuff means
[12:48] <Keyseir> !syslogd
[12:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about syslogd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:48] <Keyseir> !syslog
[12:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about syslog - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:48] <Heretic42> andi> Sounds promising. I've no idea what's wrong, can see networks through wifiradar, but not connect to'em. It's a configuration matter.
[12:49] <TrendKi||> Keyseir, i did take a look...thats what made me give up so fast...:(
[12:49] <AndiM> Be-Box: it says unknown in Xorg.0.log?
[12:49] <Keyseir> Might someone know what these terminal syslog messages mean? I have no idea what this crap might mean. http://pastebin.com/827979
[12:49] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, hehe, ok
[12:49] <TrendKi||> Keyseir, but does it work now?
[12:49] <smoenux> amicke: open Emerald Theme manager > Edit Tab > Frame/Shaddows sub-tab
[12:50] <AndiM> Heretic42: try WEP encryption "open" vs. "closed" or similar. try a lower bitrate. try changing basic/operational rateset (the rates that you indicate to support with your card).
[12:50] <amicke> smoenux: just had to reboot will take a look at that soon
[12:50] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, Yeah, XP had some OMGILOSTPOWERANDCRASHED bugs but I didn't lose it
[12:50] <Keyseir> TrendKi||, I'm worried about the ramificiations of it randomly exploding while i'm away though
[12:50] <shadowsong> andim: what do you advice?how can i run Amsn? which package should i prefer?i tried ubuntu synaptic package manager.it didnt work
[12:51] <Heretic42> andi> will do. btw, it's not a card as such, it's a usb device (Gigabyte wozzit).
[12:51] <AndiM> shadowsong: I don't use amsn, but it worked fine on all installations I made (Debian, mostly, but also Ubuntu).
[12:52] <shadowsong> andim: can i install .deb in ubuntu?
[12:52] <AndiM> shadowsong: but that doesn't mean that it always works, it could just be an issue of the current package version.
[12:52] <shadowsong> andim: both 0.95 and 0.97 gave same error.
[12:53] <AndiM> shadowsong: mixing Debian .debs with Ubuntu is dangerous at the moment, I think, but if it installs without ripping apart the whole packaging dependencies then it's safe I'd say.
[12:53] <shadowsong> andim: do you think this fix the problem?i mean manually install
[12:54] <MattJ> I use Firestarter. Since I installed it, I can't access the PC from other computers on te network
[12:54] <MattJ> *the
[12:54] <AndiM> shadowson: dpkg -i --no-act amsn_DEBIAN.deb. If that doesn't blow up catastrophically, then go for the real thing.
[12:54] <amicke> smoenux: found it :)

[12:56] <MattJ> My PC is 192.168.0.1, and my other PC is 192.168.0.2
[12:57] <amicke> smoenux: i found a print screen of a desktop that i liked a lot so i'm trying to get it to look like that :)
[12:57] <smoenux> amicke: hehehe... yeah... ive seen a couple of nice ones on the ubuntu forums
[12:58] <johan1> Hi! Can anyone tell me how to make TOTEM work ... it needs plugins ....
[12:59] <amicke> smoenux: yes, i was very dissapointed with ubuntu first because i didn't like it's orignal look but now i love it :P
[12:59] <mamzers555> johan1; take a look at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[01:00] <phpError> This is strange, I have just installed the latest Ubuntu. Fresh install, no upgrade. And now my sound isn't working :S. I've installed the 32bit version. Anyone know a solution?
[01:00] <smoenux> amicke: yeah.... myself, I like the simplified look, I love google for example
[01:00] <shadowsong> andim:hey i downloaded the ubuntu .deb package and i manually install it.now it works.
[01:00] <crimsun> phpError: which audio chipset?
[01:01] <johan1> How much better is the latest version??? Is it worth the upgrade???
[01:01] <amicke> smoenux: you got taste :) This is the theme that i liked: http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot07np2.png
[01:01] <phpError> crimsun, I'm using onboard. It's C-Media Electronics.
[01:01] <battlesquid> all of a sudden i can't hear any sound, what can i do to fix this (except from restarting or logging out and in)? is there some service that can be restarted or something?
[01:01] <amicke> smoenux:  do you know where i can find those icons ?
[01:01] <efuzzyone> how can i know what version of ubuntu is installed on a remote machine?
[01:01] <phpError> And restarting / logging out / in isn't the problem.
[01:02] <phpError> I just have no sound at all.
[01:02] <battlesquid> phpError, do you also have sound that comes and goes?
[01:02] <crimsun> phpError: pastebin ``lspci -nv && asoundconf list && cat /etc/asound.conf ~/.asoundrc* && amixer''

[01:03] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[01:04] <crimsun> Otacon22: which tv card do you use?
[01:04] <smoenux> amicke: on the right you will see the links to icons
[01:04] <Otacon22> LG
[01:04] <Otacon22> work perfectly
[01:04] <Otacon22> i see all , but nothing sound
[01:04] <Otacon22> I don'tr know the model
[01:05] <bhudda> Can anyone decipher this error message? glGo: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL_image-1.2.so.0: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

[01:06] <deirdre> I just installed edgy and i added my wife as a user, but the sound won't work for her account, can someone help?
[01:06] <he-man> anyone knows how to share folders between two linux computers?
[01:06] <Otacon22> crimsun, ok!
[01:06] <crimsun> phpError: you have two distinct available audio drivers for pcm
[01:06] <crimsun> phpError: which do you want to use, the onboard or the expansion?
[01:07] <bhudda> mribas, visit #ubuntu-es for help in espanol!
[01:07] <Otacon22> crimsun, http://rafb.net/paste/results/JPMy1B31.html
[01:08] <phpError> crimsun, I would like to use my onboard, how do I specify Ubuntu to do that?
[01:08] <bhudda> Argh, you would think  I would have these kinds of problems with something other than a strategy game...
[01:08] <crimsun> Otacon22: because the following two modules are loaded: bt878 and bttv
[01:08] <crimsun> Otacon22: bt878 grabs /dev/dsp from alsa, causing a conflict.
[01:09] <Otacon22> so what can i do?
[01:09] <amicke> smoenux: do you know how i change so that windows are focuesed when i klick at them?
[01:09] <amicke> klick
[01:09] <smoenux> amicke: I'll get you the direct link to the icons quick
[01:10] <amicke> smoenux: ok, thanks
[01:10] <crimsun> Otacon22: consult what others do
[01:10] <crimsun> Otacon22: one possibility is to use snd-bt87x
[01:10] <abo> bhudda... what's causing that?
[01:10] <Otacon22> crimsun, and how can I cange the driver?
[01:11] <smoenux> amicke: http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1096
[01:11] <crimsun> Otacon22: unload bt878 and bttv, and load snd-bt87x. Note you'll lose video.
[01:11] <smoenux> amicke: to change the way a window focuses, I think you do that in Beryl-Settings
[01:12] <amicke> smoenux: ya i figured that but don't know what i am looking for there =/
[01:12] <crimsun> phpError: asoundconf set-default-card CK804
[01:12] <crimsun> phpError: then log out and back into gnome/kde/whatever
[01:12] <Otacon22> crimsun, i have to do modprobe -r bttv and modprobe -r bt878 and then modprobe snd-bt87x
[01:12] <Otacon22> ?
[01:13] <crimsun> Otacon22: something along those lines. Sorry, I'm quite preoccupied.
[01:13] <deirdre> I just installed edgy and i added my wife as a user, the sound card works for me but not her her account, can someone help?
[01:15] <VigoFusio1> deirde: Are you both set with same permissions and stuff?
[01:16] <deirdre> i made sure she has access to audio devices
[01:16] <AndiM> deirdre: adduser USER audio or so. And do the same for all other groups you're belonging to (see "groups")
[01:16] <deirdre> but i didn'r give her admin
[01:16] <erpo> Hi all. I've installed the nvidia kernel module packages and the nvidia-glx package. But when I switch from the nv driver in xorg.conf to the nvidia driver and restart X, I my monitor clicks off and doesn't receive and signal from the computer. What's wrong?
[01:17] <sg> hi i am 1 day old ubuntu user trying to setup ubuntu edgy based server.
[01:17] <sg> most of the setup is done except the wireless connectivity
[01:18] <sg> am using netgear usb dongle
[01:18] <sg> any suggestions for getting WG111T
[01:18] <sg> to work?
[01:19] <gwoodcock> Hi, could anyone please help me. I am using ubuntu 6.06 and everytime I reset or switch off I have to re-enter my dns settings under networking as ubuntu loses them.
[01:20] <AndiM> sg: number one objective: which chipset? then you know which driver options you have.
[01:20] <efuzzyone> how to enable remote desktop on a remote machine using ssh?
[01:20] <skript> which gigabit ethernet chipset is easier to get running under dapper: marvel yukon or realtek 8169S ?
[01:20] <Hobbsee> skript: i'd take a guess at the latter
[01:20] <bhudda> erpo have you tried just restarting completly? I had to do that after I installed the ATI drivers instead of the Mesa ones
[01:20] <VigoFusio1> I have not had my coffee yet,my answers, if any will be slow if at all. :)
[01:20] <pfred1> realtek does seem to enjoy wide support
[01:20] <Hobbsee> marvell doesnt have wide support
[01:21] <pfred1> doesn't realtek ship linux drivers?
[01:21] <bhudda> psh, I should have slept...I have to leave in 2 hours and I haven't slept at all!
[01:21] <AndiM> pfred1: *very* wide support given how crappy/weak those chipsets are ;)
[01:21] <pfred1> like don't they actually cintribute to the kernel?
[01:21] <VigoFusio1> Pooting is FUN!
[01:21] <erpo> bhudda, Yes, I've tried that.
[01:21] <pfred1> the company themselves that is
[01:22] <bhudda> erpo hmm well then , I can't say...I have never owned a NVIDIA card so...wish I could help.
[01:22] <johan1> Has anyone here ever got SQL Ledger to work on Ubuntu? It tells me it is installed  ... but I have no idea where!!!!! HELP!!!!!
[01:22] <skript> any experience with d-link cards based on rtl8169 ? I've read on some forums that kernel detects it as a 8169 card, but the cards don't work (dlink 528T) ?
[01:22] <pfred1> AndiM ethernet is ethernet just set it and forget it is my motto
[01:22] <pfred1> I've had them fancy 3com cards they jsut more bother
[01:23] <roryy> johan1: maybe look in /usr/share/sql-ledger, or run 'dpkg -L sql-ledger'
[01:23] <pfred1> dlinks seems to be a crappy breed
[01:23] <pfred1> get the no name chinese ethernet adapters
[01:23] <johan1> thanks roryy
[01:23] <pfred1> they work best!
[01:23] <roryy> johan1: it looks like you access the program via a web-browser; not sure how you'd set it up
[01:23] <Otacon22> crimsun, i have unloaded bttv and bt878 and then loaded snd-bt87x, but the video don't work, so I have reloaded bttv and now work, but the sound not yet
[01:24] <gwoodcock> Hi, could anyone please help me. I am using ubuntu 6.06 and everytime I reset or switch off I have to re-enter my dns settings under networking as ubuntu loses them.
[01:24] <pfred1> the cheaper your ethernet card is the better the chance it'll just work
[01:24] <bhudda> yay for onboard I say
[01:24] <Hobbsee> skript: you want a dlink card with an atheros chipset
[01:24] <skript> pfred1: ehehe... I like your conclusion ;)
[01:24] <Hobbsee> !wireless > skript
[01:25] <Hobbsee> skript: check the hardware wireless stuff in that link - it's got a list of supported cards (or used to)
[01:25] <skript> hobbsee: well.. thanks, but I'm looking for wireready, not wireless ;)
[01:25] <s0mmie> erpo: boot into recovery mode. then edit xorg.conf with nano, change your driver to VESA. Then boot into normal mode, and install the nVIDIA drivers using Automatix2.
[01:25] <s0mmie> worked for me.
[01:25] <Hobbsee> skript: good point.  i keep forgetting
[01:26] <Otacon22> HI all, I have a TV pci card on my pc with ubuntu and I have installed "zapping", a package to see the tv by tv card, all work correctly, bui I can see the video but I can't listen the audio, why?
[01:26] <defrysk> s0mmie, please dont advise automatix
[01:26] <erpo> s0mmie, What's Automatix2?
[01:26] <AndiM> pfred1: heh, for endusers maybe, but tell that to server admins... especially with gigabit ethernets that are many things that can go wrong when choosing a cheap chip for a less-than-cheapo installation.
[01:26] <defrysk> erpo, stay away from automatix
[01:26] <johan1> roryy - just two pics where you said to look ....
[01:26] <roryy> johan1: hrm
[01:27] <s0mmie> why ignore automatix? o.O it works great.
[01:27] <AndiM> Otacon22: probably your tv card driver recognized the wrong card type, thus causing the audio multiplexer to be programmed with incorrect settings. try card type module parameter or so.
[01:27] <chicken_man> Hi, can someone help me with installing ubuntu, when I get to partitioning I do not see any of my partitions, but they are there ? http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4922/ubuntuinstallproblemdi6.png
[01:27] <roryy> johan1: try running 'dpkg -L sql-ledger'; otherwise, the only thing I can suggest is Google (presumable this program has a homepage)
[01:27] <defrysk> !automatix | s0mmie
[01:27] <ubotu> s0mmie: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:27] <johan1> roryy there will be a setup or something somewhere I would guess - Any thoughts where? I would have thought it would have set it up and added an icon to the menu ...
[01:27] <VigoFusio1> Automatix is unsupported and most everyone I talk to says leave it alone.
[01:27] <jmspeex> Can someone help me understand why and ACPI event (lid, ac adaptor) just crashes Edgy64 on my Core2 laptop. Edgy32 runs fine.
[01:28] <skript> AndiM: so what would you recommend for an end-user that runs a home-lan server ? what chipset, apart from 3com cards ?
[01:28] <chronosoft> could someone give me an example of the "at" command?
[01:28] <s0mmie> oh. fair enough. it's always worked 100% for me. I swear by it. Still, rules is rules I guess.
[01:28] <chronosoft> >.<... at midnight (command) didn't work :(
[01:28] <roryy> johan1: unfortunately (and I'm guessing here) it probably doesn't have a nice GUI setup

[01:29] <Otacon22> <AndiM>, I will send you my lsmod list between 10 minutes
[01:29] <AndiM> skript: I think (but I don't have too much experience here) for a home lan server you can use almost anything these days.
[01:29] <chicken_man> Can someone help me with installing ubuntu, when I get to partitioning I do not see any of my partitions, but they are there ? http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4922/ubuntuinstallproblemdi6.png
[01:29] <defrysk> chronosoft, w32codecs does nothing for totem

[01:30] <chronosoft> defrysk, ah :(
[01:31] <chronosoft> well try mplayer :P
[01:31] <smoenux> amicke: ok... I'm gonna log off now... have fun with xgl! bye
[01:31] <johan1> sorry roryy - thanks for your help .... Is the latest version of Ubuntu worth the upgrade? and will it run on a pent III?
[01:31] <jmspeex> AndiM: Any option worth trying?
[01:31] <defrysk> johan1, ever tried a fresh windows install (with drivers virusscanners and whatnot?)
[01:32] <he-man> could anyone suggest me where to go or how to configure a local network to see two linux computers from each other?
[01:32] <roryy> johan1: it should; I think RAM is often the biggest limiter
[01:32] <chronosoft> could someone give me an example of the "at" command?
[01:32] <johan1> roryy is the latest version worth the effort? Is it much improved???
[01:32] <salvo> halloo???

[01:56] <hades> from the internet

[01:57] <chicken_man> hades, hmmm that always has made problems for me, it might be best installing it from disk
[01:57] <defrysk> slipttees,  use sudo to edit fstab

[01:57] <hades> chicken_man: ok, now i know... ;) but is thare any opportunity to install the drivers from the console
[01:58] <hades> without internet connection ?

[01:58] <defrysk> slipttees, why are you root ?
[01:58] <hades> chicken_man: i can

[01:59] <slipttees> but now doesn't edit fstab
[01:59] <slipttees> only-reading
[01:59] <slipttees> :(
[01:59] <chicken_man> hades, You might like to try that then, but it would be quicker to reinstall it.
[01:59] <hades> chicken_man: but as i saw the ati linux driver need x windows to install
[01:59] <hades> chicken_man: propably ... but i dont have the disk ...

[02:00] <Infil> VigoFusiol, ATi's drivers, that everything works out.
[02:00] <hades> chicken_man: x is installed but i cant execute it couse it cannot load the vesa drivers
[02:00] <defrysk> slipttees, sorry , I have no clue why you cannot write to fstab

[02:02] <Abst> Or something like that

[02:33] <bunnythebunny> center and right speakers.
[02:33] <trilly> peabodi: pcmcia wlan?
[02:34] <peabodi> nope built in
[02:34] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: but it's audible now?
[02:34] <peabodi> prism 2.5
[02:34] <peabodi> actiontec
[02:34] <peabodi> lshw doesn't show it
[02:34] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: if so, then:  amixer set 'Surround Jack Mode' 'Shared'
[02:34] <AndiM> peabodi: not brand, chipset!?
[02:35] <peabodi> prism2.5
[02:35] <peabodi> intersil'
[02:35] <AndiM> peabodi: shouldn't be too difficult, then, hopefully.
[02:35] <bunnythebunny> crimsun, well it was always audible. my main problem (and im sorry for not putting it forward beforehand, its just that i've been trying and tring and trying..) is the fact that ONLY my center and right speakers work in normal audio operations (from the startup to gstreamer or any other application or system reproduced sound)
[02:36] <bunnythebunny> crimsun, but if i do speaker-test -c 6 , the LEFT and RIGHT will work and all other speakers will mute.
[02:36] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: well, you didn't pass -Dplug:surround51 to speaker-test
[02:36] <mlpug> is there any screencapture program that I could use to record use of some applications on ubuntu. some demos on youtube seem to be better than videocam quality. how they do that. preferrably something that works with beryl/xgl
[02:37] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: isn't that the normal setup for standard apps, that only two "stereo" speakers will work. and then you'd have to do *special* tweaking to have plain stereo output routed to all 6 speakers?
[02:38] <AndiM> mlpug: there has been a recent review of Linux screenshot/demo mode apps. verdict: "it sucks". but then the author later said that he discovered yet another (new?) app which is incredibly good.
[02:38] <gallois> hello!!!! anyone can help on running the proprietary drivers for ATI???
[02:39] <tamacracker> Someone please help me configure my sound... I have no sound what so ever.
[02:39] <bunnythebunny> Oh but if i do Crimsun: speaker-test -b  -Dplug:surround51 -c6 , its the same thing. If i add 8192 into it, they all reproduce sound but i think the center swaps with the left and...there's some odd error that shows up inbetween testing
[02:39] <gallois> i`ve searched on every single tutorial at the internet and couldn`t get it working.... always this crap mesa issue
[02:39] <mlpug> AndiM, where was this "recent review" published?
[02:39] <bunnythebunny> AndiM: well, i guess, i don't know.
[02:39] <gallois> tried with many different versions of the driver
=== mo0lp is now known as rand
[02:40] <bunnythebunny> crimsun: oh yeah and i've got surround jack mode in independent..but i've tried both ways to no diference.
[02:40] <AndiM> mlpug: most likely linuxtoday.com linked to it, but that's of no help. better search via google (try "<APP_NAME1> <APP_NAME2> review linux").
[02:41] <ajopaul_> gallois, have u tried this : http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide not sure if this cud help u..
[02:41] <AndiM> mlpug: what's that stuff called anyway? "screenshot" "tutorial" "CBT", ...?
[02:41] <eg_linux> i wana ask about xbuntu
[02:41] <peabodi> AndiM any ideas on the wireless?
[02:41] <tamacracker> can someone help me out with my SBLive sound?
[02:41] <tamacracker> gett no sound all of a sudden, and now i can't figure it out.
[02:41] <gallois> AndiM, for sure!!! tried this one with different versions of the driver... no success at all!!! =/
[02:41] <gallois> oops
[02:41] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: then you need a custom routing ttable setup. See alsa.opensrc.org
[02:42] <gallois> ajopaul_, for sure!!! tried this one with different versions of the driver... no success at all!!! =/
[02:42] <gallois> sorry AndiM
[02:42] <peabodi> tama check your PCM volume first thing
[02:42] <tamacracker> lol
[02:42] <tamacracker> of course
[02:42] <AndiM> peabodi: no. I'm driver developer, but of course nobody ever knows everything about distro-specific setups of various chips. better search Google or Ubuntu forums for specific help about this chipset.
[02:42] <tamacracker> i've been workin with my sound for the last 4 hours.
[02:42] <bronaugh> anyhow, I'm done.
[02:43] <tamacracker> i ran out of ideas.
[02:43] <peabodi> well thanks anyway
[02:43] <AndiM> tamacracker: tried various mixer apps? gamix, kmix, amixer? or what is the problem?
[02:43] <peabodi> actually Edgy too newe for there to be anything out there that specific and it did work outta the box with Dapper
[02:44] <tamacracker> kmix was the application that took care of my sound, then last night, i logged on and my sound was gone and so was the little speaker icon/volume control was missin from the taskbar.
[02:45] <utab> .l
[02:45] <AndiM> tamacracker: basic sound driver modules loaded? user device permissions set correctly? user member of audio group and various other important groups?
[02:45] <bunnythebunny> crimsun alright i will.
[02:45] <tamacracker> AndiM all of that you just mentioned, I don't believe I even know how to comfirm.
[02:45] <tamacracker> confirm*
[02:45] <Ignite_> AndiM, you're not trying to scare him away are you? :P
[02:46] <bunnythebunny> crimsun by the way, can you tell me how i can stop all sound, including sound servers?
[02:46] <Ignite_> tamacracker, what happens when you load kmix manually?
[02:46] <tamacracker> lspci <- this recognizes my sound card.
[02:46] <tamacracker> i have to type kmix
[02:46] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: unload the sound driver.
[02:46] <tamacracker> into konsole in order to get it to open
[02:47] <crimsun> tamacracker: what audio device?
[02:47] <tamacracker> SBLive
[02:47] <Ignite_> tamacracker, press alt+f2 and type it in there and hit return, that way you don't require a konsole window.
[02:47] <AndiM> Ignite_: sure. he's still posting, though, need to try harder.
[02:47] <tamacracker> hold on ill paste it
[02:47] <crimsun> tamacracker: pastebin your ``amixer''
[02:47] <cvasilak> hi there, just installed edgy, any good guide to install beryl eye-candy in a clean system?
[02:47] <cvasilak> but a working one
[02:47] <tamacracker> k
[02:47] <Ignite_> cvasilak, the beryl website has a guide.
[02:48] <gnomefreak> cvasilak: join #ubuntu-xgl and read the topic :)
[02:48] <defrysk> !beryl | cvasilak,
[02:48] <ubotu> cvasilak,: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-xgl
[02:48] <Ignite_> cvasilak, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu
[02:49] <bunnythebunny> crimsun, sorry to persistently bother, but how do i unload the drivers? Its just i've got told in PM by someone to do some changes in .asoundrc and i was told, for the changes to take effect, i had to stop all sound first.
[02:49] <kronos-> hello
[02:49] <cvasilak> thanks guys :)
[02:49] <kronos-> hi Ignite_
[02:49] <Ignite_> Hey. :)
[02:49] <tamacracker> http://pastebin.com/828059
[02:49] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: huh?
[02:49] <kronos-> :) long time
[02:50] <crimsun> whoever told you that is silly
[02:50] <kronos-> anyway, can you help me with something ?
[02:50] <kronos-> :D
[02:50] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: asoundrc is parsed once per device open. Just restart the sound/video app(s)
[02:50] <bunnythebunny> crimsun: the sound drivers how do i unload them? :P
[02:50] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: 08:50 < crimsun> whoever told you that is silly
[02:50] <bunnythebunny> crimsun, well ok alright
[02:50] <kronos-> Ignite_ :D
[02:50] <AndiM> bunnythebunny: /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart or so would reload stuff, but only if sound devices are unused.
[02:51] <crimsun> AndiM: no it doesn't.
[02:51] <crimsun> it only stores and restores mixer levels
[02:51] <tamacracker> did anyone get my pastebin?
[02:52] <crimsun> tamacracker: sec
[02:52] <finalbeta> crimsun> whoever told you that is silly , I resent that. My logic tells me that whatever using the sound server would need a restart of the server before it took effect, but I could be wrong.
[02:52] <tamacracker> ok
[02:52] <AndiM> crimsun: akh, right, I wasn't entirely sure of it, so I said "or so". I usually unload my modules manually.
[02:52] <crimsun> finalbeta: there is no sound server. You've hung around long enough in #alsa to know better.
[02:52] <bunnythebunny> crimsun hah...well i'll just go and try to custom route ttable setup.
[02:52] <bunnythebunny> AndiM i see. bah i guess i wont need to do it anyway.
[02:52] <trilly> HA! i could now identify my problem with my wlan pcmcia card! its not that the orinoco driver doesnt work, but the cardbus controller doesnt work! i cant see the pcmcia device when inserted to the slot
[02:53] <bunnythebunny> doesn't work, what i've been sugested.
[02:53] <trilly> it works on mac os 9 and with other cards its the same
[02:53] <trilly> oh and i also run edgy
[02:53] <AndiM> trilly: if it's a 16bit PCMCIA (ISA) card, then PCMCIA utils should identify it, if it's CardBus, then lspci
[02:53] <crimsun> AndiM: yes, you have to as of Ubuntu Hoary. Up until then, alsa-driver's initscript still handled that
[02:54] <archangelpetro> is there any way to get wmv9 files playing on amd64 ubuntu?
[02:54] <crimsun> tamacracker: I asked for amixer, and you pasted lspci ?
[02:55] <tamacracker> oh
[02:55] <archangelpetro> or at least a nice tutorial which i can follow?
[02:55] <tamacracker> lol
[02:55] <tamacracker> sorry
[02:55] <tamacracker> type in amixer in konsole?
[02:55] <crimsun> yes, please
[02:56] <trilly> AndiM: ahh ok, its a cardbus allright, but lspci also sees only the controller, not the card.. from what ivce seen it seems to hang in the middle of recognizing the card (log output and first shell)
[02:56] <crimsun> finalbeta: no offense was intended, btw.
[02:56] <tamacracker> Crimsun: http://pastebin.com/828062
[02:57] <trilly> it worked with cardctl, but ubuntu egdy doesnt allow me to use it anymore
[02:58] <archangelpetro> ?
[02:58] <crimsun> tamacracker: this is your onboard's mixer representation. Aren't you trying to use your sblive?
[02:58] <ublender> ok, relatively simple question: how do you get flv to play or even transcode, in edgy?
[02:58] <tamacracker> yes Crimsun.
[02:58] <crimsun> tamacracker: what's the output from ``asoundconf list''?
[02:58] <ublender> its like all capabilities of flv dissapeared this release
[02:58] <tamacracker> Kubuntu Edgy keeps switching it to the onboard.
[02:59] <josh_> hows it going all
[02:59] <crimsun> tamacracker: and are you using 6.06.1 or 6.10?
[02:59] <ubuntu2> how do I change my default locale? I can:t type properly because its: set to jp=JP
[02:59] <tamacracker> 6.10
[02:59] <josh_> what is a good application for webcams?
[02:59] <crimsun> tamacracker: ok, you need to do two things:
[02:59] <tamacracker> Edy Eft
[02:59] <tamacracker> KDE
[02:59] <tamacracker> tamacracker@tamacracker:~$ asoundconf list
[02:59] <tamacracker> Names of available sound cards:

[02:59] <josh_> i have camora but it makes the quality of my new webcam bite
[02:59] <tamacracker> oh crap, sorry!

[03:00] <apokryphos> josh_: kopete and amsn have webcam support over the msn messenger protocol
[03:00] <cyborgcey> Question, I have a Palm Zire31 with RealOne Player for Palm ver. 1.1a is there any way to download MP3s/ Podcast to it?
[03:00] <josh_> really....
[03:00] <josh_> the kopete that came with dapper?
[03:00] <crimsun> tamacracker: (ok, actually three things)
[03:00] <ubuntu2> anyone?
[03:00] <tamacracker> options snd-via82xx index=-2
[03:00] <tamacracker> and I don't know what UART is.

=== kronos- is now known as kronos
[03:02] <ubuntu2> is this even visible or am I using this irc client wrong..
[03:02] <bunnythebunny> Crimsun, i've just found out something interesting. look at how the tests react(if you dont mind). http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32738/   if i go through 4 channels, all speakers go fine. but when i use the 6 channels...
[03:02] <ubuntu2> is this readable?
[03:03] <josh_> we can see you
[03:03] <ubuntu2> ok
[03:03] <tamacracker> OK
[03:03] <ubuntu2> thanks
[03:03] <tamacracker> you got the sound to work
[03:03] <defrysk> we read you indeed
[03:03] <crimsun> bunnythebunny: I'm going to sleep in about 5 seconds, sorry.
[03:03] <tamacracker> but one problem
[03:03] <evol3> Does Ubuntu 6.1 have support for WPA-PSK?
[03:03] <josh_> ur using gnome desktop correct?
[03:03] <djtansey> is there anyway to configure the workspace layout (other than specifying # of rows?) i'd like my layed out like a cross -- my primary desktop in the middle and one more desktop on either side.
[03:03] <tamacracker> crimsun, the sound is really low
[03:03] <crimsun> tamacracker: so turn it up
[03:03] <tamacracker> and the icon of the volume control is missing again
[03:03] <bunnythebunny> crimsun, ah alright have a good night, thanks for everything.
[03:03] <tamacracker> my kmix icon
[03:03] <josh_> tamacracker: console -> alsamixer -> turn up all the speakers
[03:04] <ubuntu2> hm wrong channel actually +~
[03:04] <ubuntu2> .quit

[03:04] <ubuntu2> `
[03:04] <ubuntu2> [
[03:04] <evol3> Does Ubuntu 6.1 have support for WPA-PSK?
[03:05] <josh_> i dont trust wifi yet
[03:05] <tamacracker> If anyone could help me, i'd like to get the icon up on my taskbar permanently for my kmix
[03:05] <evol3> alright
[03:05] <tamacracker> and alslamix is good on my console :D
[03:05] <josh_> tamacracker: right click, add to panel, kmix
[03:05] <josh_> or something along those lines
[03:06] <tamacracker> for some reason that application is missing.
[03:06] <tamacracker> but when i type kmix into the konsole
[03:06] <josh_> kmix probably wont be there
[03:06] <tamacracker> it'll pop up
[03:06] <josh_> then create a launcher icon
[03:06] <josh_> have it run kmix in the console
[03:06] <rbrtoclto> I'm having troubles with a fresh install of edgy (xubuntu), it installs fine, no errors, but on the first boot after I don't even see grub come up, I just get a black screen with the cursor flash around the top left corner
[03:06] <tamacracker> launcher for those not in the K Menu?
[03:07] <defrysk> tamacracker, put it in Autoload and set kmix to appear in the notificationarea
[03:07] <josh_> yep
[03:07] <defrysk> autostart*
[03:07] <tamacracker> how do i do that def?
[03:07] <apokryphos> kmix -> settings -> configure kmix -> dock in panel
[03:07] <tamacracker> or that!
[03:07] <josh_> or that
[03:07] <rbrtoclto> anyone seen this before?
[03:07] <josh_> well not a panel in the traditional sense
[03:08] <tamacracker> that's what I did last time
[03:08] <tamacracker> and when i relogged on just now
[03:08] <josh_> rbrtoclto: what type of computer do you have?
[03:08] <tamacracker> it wasn't there
[03:08] <tamacracker> how do i set it into autostart through konsole?
[03:08] <rbrtoclto> josh_: celeron d 331, nvidia graphics card, pata primary hdd
[03:08] <peabodi_> AndiM I just found something on the web concerning the Prism2.5 card
[03:09] <josh_> and no errors on install?
[03:09] <peabodi_> wrong driver
[03:09] <josh_> it just wont boot... not even to grub
[03:09] <rbrtoclto> I can boot back into the live CD and it appears to have installed fine
[03:09] <rbrtoclto> damn
[03:09] <rbrtoclto> just did a check of the install CD and 1 checksum failed :O
[03:09] <defrysk> tamacracker, nano -w .kde/Autostart/kmix
[03:09] <rbrtoclto> guess I'll reburn it and start over
[03:09] <tamacracker> thank you :D
[03:09] <defrysk> tamacracker, write kmix in it
[03:10] <defrysk> and save it with xctr-x
[03:10] <josh_> rgr rbrtoclto
[03:10] <tamacracker> yeah type this exactly into the konsole
[03:10] <tamacracker> nano -w .kde/Autostart/kmix
[03:10] <defrysk>  and then Y(es)
[03:10] <tamacracker> ok :D
[03:10] <AndiM> rbrtoclto: you could try using LILO if you don't get grub configured/booting correctly
[03:10] <tamacracker> oh in this file
[03:10] <tamacracker> type kmix
[03:10] <tamacracker> ?
[03:10] <defrysk> yes
[03:10] <AndiM> rbrtoclto: but only do this if everything else fails
[03:10] <umops> Are commands in sudo crontab -e executed as sudo by default?
[03:10] <defrysk> ans save it with ctrl-x
[03:11] <defrysk> and y
[03:11] <bunnythebunny> AndiM, a quick question..i havent custom routed the ttable setup yet, but do you think at this point that getting other mixers is worth to try? before going into other things. if neither of these dont work..i'll just go report it.
[03:11] <tamacracker> sweet
[03:11] <tamacracker> gonna relog
[03:11] <tamacracker> brb
[03:11] <defrysk> tamacracker, and configure kmix to open as an applet
[03:11] <tamacracker> how would i do that?
[03:12] <defrysk> in the kmix setting of course
[03:12] <defrysk> configuration
[03:12] <defrysk> and stuff
[03:12] <tamacracker> ok
[03:12] <defrysk> like dock in blahblah
[03:12] <defrysk> that kinda stuff
[03:12] <rbrtoclto> I probably should mention I've successfully installed it before, but was having problems getting the integrated video (gma900) to display at my lcd monitor's native res (16x10).. so I bought a cheap nvidia graphics card
[03:12] <tamacracker> hey
[03:13] <tamacracker> the volume values
[03:13] <tamacracker> is on non...
[03:13] <tamacracker> is that correct?
[03:13] <rbrtoclto> and I'm doing a fresh reinstall since I hadn't configured anything
[03:13] <defrysk> tamacracker, if you have sound , yes
[03:13] <tamacracker> ok :D
[03:13] <josh_> ok rbrtoclto if you still have issues after reinstall u know where to find us :P
[03:14] <rbrtoclto> hehe :)
[03:14] <rbrtoclto> I was wondering if there's a way to configure software raid during install actually.. or would I have to use the server install CD and do it manually
[03:14] <JeffBell> How can I change/diversify my upgrade sources?  My attempt to upgrade to 6.10 failed, but I didn't see why until I paid closer attention.  I was able to download/fetch all components (28 of 29 files, I believe) except for one.  I received an error "failed to fetch..." foo bar.  I understand that perhaps I can add a new source to me /etc/apt/sources.list ....but what location should I add?  Or where is a list of locations I can choose from?
[03:14] <mooky> does someone have a clear explination for what has happened to the disk subsystem in edgy. My fstab looks a mess with disk devices referenced by a UID
[03:14] <tamacracker> brb
[03:14] <we2by> rbrtoclto: I think I have the same video card as you do
[03:15] <josh_> i think you will have to do it withserver, then just upgrade to your desktop version
[03:15] <rbrtoclto> we2by: I searched the forums and used 915resolution and modelines, but no joy.. so just went and got a real video card
[03:15] <josh_> i could be wrong though
[03:16] <josh_>  " /etc/X11/xorg.conf" should have the modlines
[03:17] <we2by> rbrtoclto: I have the white macbook
[03:17] <we2by> I think it got the intel gma card
[03:17] <dang`r`us> hiya
[03:17] <Ignite_> Hello.
[03:17] <dang`r`us> any idea why I can't install libsdl-dev on edgy? http://rafb.net/paste/results/ZzjwjC41.html  is the full output ...

[03:17] <rbrtoclto> we2by: are you running in native 12x9 or whatever it is?
[03:18] <we2by> native12x9? what do u mean?
[03:18] <we2by> Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller
[03:18] <we2by> got that

[03:18] <gnomefreak> dang`r`us: you have xgl/compiz installed?
[03:18] <Ignite_> dang`r`us, try installing it explicitly. :)
[03:18] <dang`r`us> gnomefreak, yes (in fact it's a leftover from dapper)
[03:19] <rbrtoclto> we2by: native resolution for the laptop's display.. 1200x900 pixels.. whatever the exact number is :)
[03:19] <gnomefreak> lol thats why
[03:19] <we2by> oh, yea. it is
[03:19] <joaquin_> hello
[03:19] <gnomefreak> dang`r`us: sudo aptitude install libsdl-dev
[03:19] <dang`r`us> pretty funny, I explicitly asked in a ubuntu-compiz channel if I was gonna run into problems after upgrading to edgy .... ;)
[03:19] <Ignite_> Hello joaquin_
[03:19] <we2by> rbrtoclto: I'm using 915resolution
[03:19] <joaquin_> is there any program to connect a web cam?
[03:19] <dang`r`us> gnomefreak, ah, nice!
[03:19] <Kippix> lu
[03:19] <dang`r`us> thanks
[03:20] <Jamesrose> Camarama
[03:20] <rbrtoclto> we2by: it didn't work for me :(  I just get the display saying "out of range"
[03:20] <gnomefreak> dang`r`us: or uninstall libglu1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-glx than install the package you need
[03:20] <Ignite_> joaquin_, how do you mean?
[03:20] <Jamesrose> camorama webcam viewer
[03:20] <Kippix> kk a t-il deja install les pilote madwifi
[03:20] <joaquin_> apt-get?
[03:20] <Kippix> ?
[03:20] <Kippix> sur debian
[03:20] <dang`r`us> never knew that aptitude had magic powers
[03:20] <Jamesrose> probable
[03:20] <asn> anybody use breezy?
[03:20] <gnomefreak> dang`r`us: yes and it can be dangerous
[03:20] <joaquin_> not a viewer.... to chat a see
[03:20] <defrysk> aptitude has cow power
[03:20] <Jamesrose> apt-get camorama
[03:20] <Jamesrose> I think
[03:20] <defrysk> but use with caution indeed
[03:20] <we2by> rbrtoclto: can you  tell me th eexact resolution from xorg.conf?
[03:21] <rbrtoclto> we2by: mine is 1680x1050
[03:21] <Jamesrose> Oh
[03:21] <dang`r`us> I can imagine
[03:21] <Ignite_> joaquin_, oh sorry, I misread, there are a few programs, I think kopete supports webcams for messaging and xawtv supports cams for recording I _think_ I'm not sure though.
[03:21] <Jamesrose> Amsn
[03:21] <dang`r`us> alright ... thanks for the help guys!
[03:21] <Jamesrose> kopete
[03:21] <Jamesrose> I find kopete's better
[03:21] <rbrtoclto> when is a LTS version of edgy due?  or not at all
[03:22] <we2by> rbrtoclto: check the hor and ver refreshrate also
[03:22] <joaquin_> thanks all... I'm installing both
[03:22] <rbrtoclto> we2by: yeah, it's correct according to monitor's documentation
[03:22] <we2by> mine is at 1280x800
[03:22] <Ignite_> rbrtoclto, there is a LTS release of Ubuntu every 18 months if I remember correctly.
[03:23] <gnomefreak> Ignite_: not 18 months i would hope since dapper is supported for 3 years
[03:23] <joaquin_> this chat go's fast----
[03:23] <joaquin_> i'm reading...
[03:23] <rbrtoclto> a bit off topic.. but does anyone else think the edgy bootsplash graphic is way uglier than the dapper one
[03:23] <dcordes> i mounted a remote folder with sshfs and can't access it via nautilus. what can be the resaon?
[03:23] <dcordes> *reason
[03:23] <we2by> I don't have the boot splash :(
[03:23] <we2by> doesn't work for edgy
[03:23] <we2by> doesn't work for macbook
[03:24] <rbrtoclto> you're not missing much imo ;)
[03:24] <joaquin_> Istart the camorama and receive an error
[03:24] <joaquin_> could not connect to /dev/video0
[03:24] <Jamesrose> Is your cam in propoly?
[03:24] <Jamesrose> Not going through a USB hub is it"
[03:24] <rbrtoclto> I liked the (x)ubuntu logo with the slightly mirrored effect, looked classy.. the new round thing is a bit cheesy looking
[03:24] <Jamesrose> ?
[03:25] <joaquin_> I'm useing a photo cam as a web cam
[03:25] <Ignite_> gnomefreak, I think I read it somewhere, not sure where though.
[03:25] <josh_> mine goes through usb and it sucks
[03:25] <joaquin_> kopete has finicshed .. i'lll try
[03:26] <paf> #zope
[03:26] <kronos> can anyone help me with some bind/named configuration issue ?
[03:26] <Jamesrose> Thats probably why
[03:26] <Jamesrose> Im not even sure a Digi cam will work
[03:26] <ronaldo> kronos: maybe
[03:27] <kronos> :)
[03:27] <ronaldo> kronos: explain your issue
[03:27] <rj45> hi
[03:27] <MeisterZopf> hi
[03:27] <Viroo> I suffer from a problem related to sound.. it works but suddenly  it i silenced and causes any media player totem/realplayer to freezes .. what do u think the source of the problem.. I also noticed in system monitor multiple of tasks of any player i run
[03:27] <kronos> ronaldo: i can't figure out how to insert a public key in a zone file
[03:28] <rj45> ciao ubuntu
[03:28] <Viroo> anyone?
[03:29] <joaquin_> kopete seams to be working
[03:29] <joaquin_> can anyone want to try?
[03:29] <Viroo> is it related to the alsa service or hardware ?
[03:29] <VoX> Viroo: probably hardware
[03:29] <VoX> try a different sound card
[03:30] <rj45> i need help
[03:30] <Viroo> ok  lets say I a builtin sound chip.. how should I force the system to stick with  my other sound card ?
[03:30] <rj45> i have problems
[03:31] <Kingsqueak> Viroo: if you don't want to use the onboard sound, can't you just disable it in your BIOS?
[03:33] <JeffBell> I need some clues on upgrading  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32740/
[03:33] <utab> It takes ages to print on my network printer what is the reason: That is a windows printer and I am reaching that through SAMBA sever but when I send lets say a !
[03:33] <mooky> does someone have a clear explination for what has happened to the disk subsystem in edgy. My fstab looks a mess with disk devices referenced by a UID
[03:34] <LjL> !uuid | mooky
[03:34] <ubotu> mooky: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in the terminal: "blkid"
[03:34] <mooky> LjL thank you - but why has this change been implimented
[03:34] <ajopaul_> how does one have autostarted apps on flux?
[03:34] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: it's /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:34] <mooky> it seems a pointless change, that makes text configuration files harder to manage
[03:35] <LjL> mooky: that is to ease the transition to new IDE drivers (which will use /dev/sd* names instead of /dev/hd*), as well as to make things easier when you move drives around IDE slots
[03:35] <utab> 1MB document, on the windows printers and faxes I see that it is spooling and the document is quite more larger than my actual document
[03:35] <mooky> LjL I've noy seen that change on the ata LKML branch
[03:35] <mooky> is it a kernel change or an ubuntu change
[03:35] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: you can find other archives on ubuntu.com, us.archive.ubuntu.com is the one I'm using as an example
[03:35] <LjL> mooky: it's not pointless, although those long UUIDs can be sort of annoying - drives being referenced uniquely rather than by their physical location is a good idea
[03:36] <mooky> s/noy/not
[03:36] <LjL> mooky: it's an Ubuntu change AFAIK
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: change the archive URL, then do apt-get update, then start the upgrade again
[03:36] <mooky> LjL thanks for the info - that at least explains why I've not seen it on the LibATA kernel branch
[03:36] <josh_> what is the command to grep inside a .gz file?
[03:36] <mooky> josh_ you can't
[03:36] <mooky> tar ztv file | grep string
[03:36] <josh_> yeah you can... ive done it before but i cant remember the command
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> josh_: zgrep
[03:37] <josh_> that one, thanks king
[03:37] <Gasten> Hello. is there any app that can show some kind of graph on soundvolume, freq, and stuff like that for the Jack auido server?
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> there's a bunch of 'z' commands , zless, zcat, zgrep etc. same idea
[03:37] <mooky> why do you need a graph on sound volume ?
[03:37] <Ignite_> Gasten, I'm not sure, but Audacity might be what you're looking for.
[03:38] <josh_> he is looking for an eqaulizer
[03:38] <dcordes> anybody?
[03:38] <Ignite_> !info audacity
[03:38] <ubotu> audacity: A fast, cross-platform audio editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.4b-2.1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1850 kB, installed size 5444 kB
[03:38] <Ignite_> :)
[03:38] <Gasten> josh_: Yeah, something like that.
[03:38] <Ignite_> dcordes, ?
[03:39] <josh_> i use amarok.. .it has an equalizer... of sorts..
[03:39] <josh_> hey Kingsqueak, can you use zgrep on normal files also?
[03:39] <chronosoft> does anyone know where ubuntu default installs the php binary?
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> dcordes: can you see it from the commandline?
[03:39] <pyalot> hi, I need some help here, I've got a swiss sg keyboard but my alt key doesn't work, so I can't type # or edgy braces, at etc.
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> josh_: not sure, never tried
[03:40] <josh_> me either lol, well first time for everything i suppose
[03:40] <LjL> mooky: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/libata-for-all-ata-disks
[03:40] <dooglus> chronosoft: /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5 ?
[03:40] <mooky> LjL thank you, I'll have a read now
=== ralph_ is now known as ralpho1234
[03:40] <Kingsqueak> josh_: yeah it seems you can
[03:40] <josh_> i just saw that :P
[03:40] <mooky> (I was searching LKML for references)
[03:40] <pyalot> altough the alt key in itself pretty much works, like for navigating with alt+left-arrow in mozilla
[03:40] <josh_> thats gonna make the script shorter
[03:40] <chronosoft> cool i'll try that dooglus
[03:40] <Gasten> The thing is that it should capture all sounds that reaches my stereo, not only those omitting from auio-fils.
[03:41] <mooky> LjL whoaaa thats a bold move
[03:41] <canute> Hi there. I'm trying to install a package called "vdrift", however that package is dependant of "vdrift-data" (which i also have), "vdrift-data" is however dependant of "vdrift" again so neither will install, any thoughts on how to do it?
[03:41] <rj45> ciao Panaclerio
[03:42] <Kingsqueak> canute: you using apt-get?
[03:42] <alberto> Hi.
[03:42] <Panaclerio> rj45: ciao
[03:42] <rj45> :)
[03:42] <canute> no, .dep
[03:42] <Kingsqueak> canute: try just doing   apt-get install vdrift
[03:42] <alberto> what packages do I need to install for make my laptop keys to work?
[03:42] <JeffBell> Kingsqueak, thank you very much.  I will try that!
[03:42] <canute> i have
[03:42] <canute> nothing found
[03:43] <alberto> 7C
[03:43] <LjL> mooky: honestly i think it was about time we stopped referring to drives based on what end of a cable they happened to be found at. UUIDs don't look that cute, but at least
[03:43] <pyalot> nobody an idea why my alt doesn't work as a modifier?
[03:44] <pyalot> edge eft here
[03:44] <mooky> LjL I totally see the point, but the letter hd or sd was never determained by the position on the cable, but the actual chip driver, so while I admire the point of removing that distinction, I also don't see the point of making everything /dev/sdX it really didn't matter
[03:45] <mooky> its bold to go against the kernel
[03:45] <mooky> and use an invididual kernel contributors patches
[03:45] <rj45> buenos dias
[03:45] <eg_linux> i want see the sysreq in ubuntu
[03:45] <mooky> more so as they are basing future releases on this technology
[03:45] <eg_linux> i can,t see the link
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> if you don't like the long UUID's just label your partitions and use LABEL= instead
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> very hand for removable media
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> handy
[03:47] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: hii .. i,m looking to see ubuntu sysreq
[03:47] <LjL> mooky: well, skimming through google's hits for kernel lists, it seems to me they're likely to be including that in the mainstream kernel sooner than later, anyway
[03:47] <veelos> Hello, I have trouble updgrading to Edgy. I did a clean install of 6.06 and did gksu "update-manager -c" and updates files, and I also tried sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: not sure where they are, what are you looking to run it on?
[03:48] <LjL> Kingsqueak: yes that's the way i think it should have been done from the very beginning. though right new you seldom even remember that such things as "labels" exist... ;-\
[03:48] <mooky> LjL possibly, I'v found a debate on it, Alan cox seems keen but Jeff Garitz seems against it
[03:48] <veelos> But it didn't updgrade to Edgy
[03:48] <mooky> which doesn't look like "sooner" but I do agree with what your saying
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> LjL yeah honestly, I never knew that existed until I got on my current jobsite and they were using it
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> LjL to me, that was a HUGE new thing, how I'd never known about that ...I don't know
[03:48] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: p3 633mb 192 ram
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: it should run on that, I would highly recommend xubuntu and if you can upgrade the RAM to 512mb ideally if you can.  Xubuntu will be easier on older machines
[03:49] <user-land> is there a machine available for compiling applications for Ubuntu ?
[03:50] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: I run xubuntu on a 256MB box that's around 1Ghz and it works fine
[03:50] <rbrtoclto> when I'm partitioning, can I make swap my first partition?
[03:50] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: so u recommend to use xubuntu not ubuntu?
[03:50] <JeffBell> veelos, I was having an error upgrading as well today.  What is your error, specifically?
[03:50] <LjL> mooky: well, time will tell... but anyway, i agree with what someone's seems to be saying, i.e. that any app that relies on whether something is called "hda" vs "sda" is a broken app - then in this view, the "bold move" doesn't look too bold anymore
[03:51] <rbrtoclto> e.g. hda1 swap, hda2 root, hda3 home
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: for that machine yeah, xubuntu is a lighter weight desktop so it will run a bit faster
[03:51] <mooky> LjL  I can't argue with that
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: you can try any of them and change your preferences later too but xubuntu is where I'd start on that system
[03:51] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: mmmm.. ok .. and thanks
[03:51] <veelos> JeffBell: it just updates files, and needs to reboot but nothing is really changed
[03:51] <defrysk> rbrtoclto, sure why not
=== gustavo is now known as suricata
[03:51] <mooky> nor would I choose to as thats a very valid point
[03:52] <nofxx> hey.. my disks are f** up... disks see my ext3 as swap (but dont use it)  , my swap as windows ntfs.... and the pc is really slow.... because there is no swap I guess..... what I need to configure these stuff?
[03:52] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: so Xubuntu have a good interface or what ??
[03:52] <netcatc> hello all
[03:52] <jdahm> hey, under ubuntu 6.06 and gnome 2.whatever, when I searched under the gnome applet for wireless networking, my network name came up under the list, but under 6.10 (even when upgraded) no network names that are in range are shown, I guess U could always use kismet every time to search for the names, but this is annoying, how can I fix it?
[03:52] <LjL> Kingsqueak: always referenced volumes by volume name in AmigaOS, worked fine. on PCs (Windows and Linux), somehow everybody always seemed to like to give meaningless names such as C: or "hda" based on whether your IDE cable was long enough to reach a slave drive without getting another cable and using the secondary slot... ;)
[03:52] <netcatc> someone knows how I resolve it
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: it uses xfce4 and a nice one at that, check xubuntu.com probably screenshots there
[03:53] <netcatc>  Depende: phpapi-20020918  but it is not installable
[03:53] <netcatc> this bug?
[03:53] <Ruffles> hi there. i'd like to use the same visual settings for 2 user accounts... does anyone know which are the .directories i should copy from 1 home dir into the other?
[03:53] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: thanks for helping me man
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> LjL: yeah sd* and hd* gets even more confusing when things like cdrecord and 'cooked mode' kick in, it's very hard to tell if you needed ide=scsi or not etc.
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: no problem
[03:54] <MetaMorfoziS> is there a howto to how to create a group, and how to make a folder only viewable/writeable/deletable only by that group member'S?
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: kubuntu, xubuntu, ubuntu etc. are only different by their default desktop configs, underneath they can all run the same packages
[03:54] <JeffBell> Kingsqueak, the ro->us change fixed it.  Thanks.  (Also thanks again to jrib.  And if there's anyone here from Automatix, thank you too.)
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: cool
[03:55] <Ruffles> MetaMorfoziS, i guess u gotta use chmod command
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> MetaMorfoziS: the man pages sort of explain it, you need a basic permissions howto, let me see if I can find one
[03:55] <nofxx> how can I set what /hda is my swap ???
[03:55] <ublender> hey, does someone know the location of a ffmpeg/mplayer/vlc/etc package that is compiled with most codecs?
[03:55] <ublender> (specifically h264)
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> MetaMorfoziS: try this http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-tutorials-howtos-reference-material/10862-linux-file-permissions.html
[03:56] <MetaMorfoziS> yes, i have created a group from gui (i want to know how can i do that from console) with 2 members, and i have "sudo chown :mygroupname ./folder" and chmod 0755 ./folder
[03:56] <MetaMorfoziS> but it isn't allows me to do anything with that
[03:56] <MetaMorfoziS> okay i check
[03:57] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: how can i say Xubuntu ?? sorry for this bad question
=== veelos- is now known as veelos
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> MetaMorfoziS: when you add a user to a group, that user won't be in that group until it logs out and back in again
[03:57] <dcordes> how can i get root access to my mounted sshfs folder?
[03:57] <josh_> su
[03:57] <josh_> sudo
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: I think they say 'zoo-bun-too'
[03:57] <ublender> thats right
[03:57] <MetaMorfoziS> ohoh! that's what i'm don'T knew
[03:58] <Ruffles> what is the .directory containing gnome's visual settings? panel, background, themes etc..
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> or 'zoo-boon-too'
[03:58] <MetaMorfoziS> baah i'm going to relogin, thanx!
[03:58] <josh_> sudo chown person_to_own filename
[03:58] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: ooh it,s bad in egypt
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: a bad word?
[03:58] <josh_> Ruffles: .gnome2 maybe?
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: it's a somewhat African pronunciation I think
[03:59] <glentanaka6> hello
[03:59] <nofxx> hmm....swapon ... its working..hope it will be after reboot.... where can I add mount things to happen in the boot ?
[03:59] <eg_linux> zoponto include zob it,s meaing a man part that can be marring by it

[04:00] <josh_> hate my desktop being cluttered with crap
[04:00] <ublender> so, does anyone know of a way to encode h264 in ubuntu?
[04:01] <dkalthoff> the spash screen displays and then the application does not open
[04:01] <josh_> ruffles, lemme look and check something

[04:01] <Adnarim> ?
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> anyone from the project watching?  eg_linux pointed out that 'xubuntu' spoken is a bit awkward in Egypt
[04:01] <Ruffles> josh_, alright bro

[04:02] <TheGateKeeper> rj45, nope
[04:02] <josh_> what config files are u looking for?
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: I'm pretty sure that people aren't aware of it and who knows, maybe they'll change the name around for an egyptian version
[04:02] <rj45> :O
[04:02] <squid0> how do i limit the amount of tty displays that are created on startup?
[04:02] <RuLeT> :P

[04:03] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: thay must rename in to pyrabuntu
[04:03] <dkalthoff> anyone know where to find some logs to get information on why an application is not opening?

[04:04] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: they named a car 'nova' here in the US years ago, in Spanish that translates to "no go", not a great name for a car
[04:04] <RuLeT> siktirin
[04:04] <josh_> im going to start calling people that
[04:04] <josh_> :P
[04:05] <dkalthoff> thanks roryy!
[04:05] <sioux> hi people
[04:05] <josh_> hey
[04:05] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: or like my freiend is make a distro based on gento and ubuntu is name is (phearonix)
[04:06] <veelos> Anyone else having trouble upgrading to Edgy from 6.06 ?
[04:06] <dkalthoff> TheGateKeeper: ok, i'll also look at that.
[04:06] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak:  the name of disto is phearonix
[04:06] <Kingsqueak> ah
[04:07] <Kingsqueak> clever play on fear and pharo <sp?>
[04:07] <dkalthoff> I am also having trouble upgrading
[04:07] <sioux> do you know if there are problems with running ubuntu on dell pc?, edgy on my laptop goes in kernel loop o kernel crash each time i connect a usb port
[04:07] <Doow> Hmm.. does Firefox come with flash preinstalled? Sound in flash (google videos, youtube) stopped working for me and I was gonna confiugre it. But I don't seem to have any flash package installed and firefox don't list any flash add-on. I do however have a Shockwave Flash plugin in "about:plugins"
[04:07] <nofxx> this line is correct for all ext3 in fstab ? /dev/hda5       /media/hda5     ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
[04:07] <nofxx> how is a Reiser one?
[04:07] <AndiM> dkalthoff: use strace and/or ltrace.
[04:07] <roryy> veelos: one apparently common source of problems is third-party packages, like extra codecs and so on.  Also, if you're using 'apt-get' you must run it twice
[04:07] <Doow> either way, i want to get the sound working again =)
[04:07] <dcordes> nofxx: reiser? that's dangerous using
[04:07] <dcordes> you might get killed
[04:07] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: i want say not all the name is bad . but it,s a part from this name . that sayd ZOP
[04:07] <jrib> !flash > Doow
[04:07] <nofxx> dcordes , hehehe ok... will format it to ext3....
[04:07] <Ruffles> josh_, just want the config files for panels placement and colors (transparency etc..) and icon theme
[04:08] <josh_> hmm...
[04:08] <jrib> Doow: you can try following the restricted wiki guide on setting up flash to run through aoss, or you can try flash9 beta
[04:08] <nofxx> dcordes , that line is ok for any ext3 so ?
[04:08] <Kingsqueak> nofxx: just replace ext3 with reiserfs
[04:08] <sven-tek> Hi! I'd like to know if there is something like a hardware test-center for the ubuntu distribution.
[04:08] <dcordes> but can't someone help me getting access with my normal user to sshfs foldeR?
[04:08] <alberto> nofxx: Nice fat record band...
[04:08] <AndiM> dcordes: I'm going to kill YOU if you keep making such morbid jokes... ;P
[04:08] <dcordes> :-O
[04:08] <veelos> roryy, I did a clean installation from CD ( 6.06 ) and at first boot, I tried upgrade with both methods.
[04:09] <userbn> haaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiii
[04:09] <roryy> veelos: both methods?
[04:09] <Doow> jrib: I'd rather get the builtin plugin working (it worked before) than add more packages
[04:09] <Doow> jrib: if possible
[04:09] <josh_> locate panel*conf*
[04:09] <jrib> Doow: what do you mean by "builtin plugin"?
[04:09] <josh_> use that
[04:09] <josh_> not sure which you want
[04:09] <veelos> roryy, with Synaptic and also "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" x2
[04:09] <josh_> have fun Ruffles  :P
[04:09] <Doow> jrib: appearantly I have flash installed allready, but no add-on or package with flash
[04:10] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: ooh.. can i install ubuntu in ext3 or 2 or i will change it?
[04:10] <Ruffles> josh_, mmm.. i'll take a look at it. thanks bro
[04:10] <Doow> jrib: it's listed at the "about:plugins" page
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: during the install it defaults to ext3
[04:10] <jrib> Doow: that's kind of an oxymoron :)  flash is seperate from firefox, it had to have been installed through a package or by manually adding the plugin
[04:10] <userbn> hiiiiii
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: I would recommend just doing ext3
[04:10] <roryy> veelos: hm. in that case you've quite probably found a bug.  fwiw, I used 'aptitude dist-upgrade' without major problems
[04:10] <jrib> Doow: but the aoss setup is what you want if you just want to get what you currently have to work
[04:10] <josh_> somewhere in .gconf/apps/panel is where u will find conf files lol
[04:10] <Ruffles> josh_, oh gosh! there are many files.. i'll link up the whole directory
[04:10] <Doow> jrib: ok
[04:10] <josh_> lol
[04:11] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: ok
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> roryy: is aptitude better than apt-get dist-upgrade as far as not having to do loops of -f dist-upgrade and then doing all the manual installs of the held back packages?
[04:11] <josh_> well u can probably leave out the applet folder... maybe objects folder if none of those files are needed
[04:12] <josh_> look at the 2 gconf.xml files... maybe they are what you want
[04:12] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: realy thanks too much ..
[04:12] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: no problem
[04:12] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: where r u from ?
[04:12] <Doow> jrib: I guess that means I have to get OSS to work first =)
[04:12] <Kingsqueak> <-New Jersey, US
[04:12] <josh_> lol i play games on a jersey server
[04:12] <jrib> Doow: well basically you just need to install aoss, it lets you run oss apps through alsa
[04:12] <Kingsqueak> most people from New Jersey like playing games too, but that's another story
[04:13] <Doow> jrib: aha
[04:13] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: how old r u ?
[04:13] <josh_> :) i like games... and shooting people... so i play games where i can shoot people :P
[04:13] <roryy> Kingsqueak: erm, i'm not sure.  If I recall correctly, I ran 'aptitude dist-upgrade twice', and had a basically working system.  I then had lots of useless xorg* packages leftover from 6.06 (no idea why) which I removed.  There were a few queries during the install about overwriting config files I had altered.
[04:13] <Dalik> I am trying to use access control lists to work on a shared folder.  I want to assign a group in openldap to a folder how does one go about this?
[04:13] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: plenty old
[04:13] <Kingsqueak> roryy: ah o.k. so similar issues
[04:14] <josh_> anyone in here bash script?
[04:14] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: what ??
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> roryy: the python packages and X had a pile of held back packages , that's what I meant
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: 38
[04:14] <josh_> u aint old... my wife is 4 years younger then u
[04:15] <josh_> greanted im 14 years younger then you but still
[04:15] <josh_> lol
[04:15] <Kingsqueak> my wife is a year older, and I remind her that she'll always be older than me
[04:15] <roryy> Kingsqueak: oh, yeah, i remember aptitude moaning about python-<something> -- xml ? can't remember if it resolved it automatically
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> roryy: if you see a bunch of 'packages held back' if you do  apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade, if you manually do  apt-get install <package> it fixes that
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> roryy: it's just a bit tedious to work through them
[04:16] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: lol........   i think that she is angry coz u tel her that...
[04:16] <eg_linux> Kingsqueak: :P
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> roryy: I bet there's a trick that I just don't know to do that automagically
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> eg_linux: yup
[04:16] <roryy> Kingsqueak: hmm. I don't remember having to do that
[04:16] <josh_> how would i do a grep for anything but letters? grep -v a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z filename?
[04:17] <normie> hi - i'm trying to install ubuntu on a disk at /dev/hdd while trying to maintain my windows install on /dev/sda + sdb and keeping mixed data on hda + hdb... after installation booting fails with an Error 15: File not found
[04:17] <normie> what may I have done wrong?
[04:17] <roryy> josh_: grep '[^A-Za-z] '
[04:17] <roryy> josh_: hrm, actually, maybe not
[04:17] <josh_> yeah that was what i wanted :), used to perl
[04:17] <Doow> jrib: aoss worked, thank you
[04:17] <jrib> Doow: np
[04:17] <deema_> hi
[04:17] <normie> i've tried to boot on the live-CD to check out /boot but everything looks alright
[04:17] <Ayabara> !xgl
[04:17] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - Help in #ubuntu-xgl - See http://tinyurl.com/pw5ez for Kubuntu systems
[04:17] <deema_> somebody say deema
[04:17] <f1assistance> how do i create a ubuntu boot floppy? I have a older system that won't boot from the CD and I would like to install kubuntu...
[04:18] <josh_> that looks alot like perl though roryy...
[04:18] <normie> deema :)
[04:18] <deema_> say deema_ now
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> josh_: try  grep -v [:alpha:] 
[04:18] <josh_> ok
[04:18] <josh_> lemme try
[04:18] <Dalik> normie, during the installation does the install say you have windows installed?
[04:18] <jrib> grep works on lines so that may or may not do what you want josh_
[04:19] <josh_> nope
[04:19] <normie> Dalik, nope, doesn't mention anything about it, however grub installed on /dev/hdd (hd2) gives me the option of booting into windows
[04:19] <deema_> somebody say deema_
[04:19] <normie> deema_,
[04:19] <netG> deema_
[04:19] <deema_> :)
[04:19] <Ayabara> is xgl/compiz stable? the alpha sw warning scares me :-)
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: not really, no
[04:20] <Dalik> normie, and when you boot it says file not found for the windows selection from grub?
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: if you are concerned about crashes, I wouldn't bother with it
[04:20] <normie> Dalik, nope, when i select ubuntu from the boot menu and press enter
[04:20] <alberto> Ayabara: aixgl/compiz is quite stable
[04:20] <alberto> Ayabara: with my intel915 is really stable
[04:20] <f1assistance> or actually xubuntu...
[04:20] <Ayabara> Kingsqueak, sound advice that I'll listen to. I'll just generate the effects in my head
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: I run beryl on two workstations that I use for business and they work, but there are issues from time to time
[04:20] <nanda> compiz for me is pretty stable
[04:21] <nanda> more so than beryl
[04:21] <Kingsqueak> well beryl runs pretty well for me too, but my idea of 'stable' isn't that ;-)
[04:21] <Dalik> normie, double check your grub conf file and make sure ubuntu is correct.  Such as the kernel is in the right path on the right partition.
[04:21] <roryy> f1assistance: taken a look here? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[04:21] <Kingsqueak> I get a crash once a day or so
[04:21] <Ayabara> hmm ok. I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 with an ATI X300 card
[04:21] <veelos> Anyone have any idea what I could do about that: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1779111 ?
[04:22] <nanda> compiz only messes up for me when playing videos or dvds sometimes
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: I'm all nvidia, so I'm not sure how the ATi stuff is
[04:22] <normie> Dalik, already did that and everything seems ok - will check again though, may upload my .conf and dmesg output to let you guys check out
[04:22] <Ayabara> Kingsqueak, ok. I'll just put it on hold for now.
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: the only thing would be if you are new to linux, it might frustrate you to deal with any issues
[04:23] <Dalik> upload the menu.list file under /boot/grub/
[04:23] <rbrtoclto> no luck with the edgy reinstall
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: if you are used to X issues and changing video drivers, go ahead, it's very cool.  If not, you will likely be pretty irritated should you have issues.
[04:23] <Adam_G> can someone tell me how to disable the bootsplash in edgy? I think it interferes with entering a pw for mounting encrypted FS's
[04:23] <f1assistance> roryy: thanks, I will take a look
[04:23] <rbrtoclto> installs with no errors, I reboot and after the POST just get a blank, black screen with a blinking cursor top left corner about 3 lines down
[04:23] <Dalik> normie, my ubuntu section looks like so
[04:23] <Dalik> normie, title		Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386

[04:24] <Dalik> savedefault
[04:24] <Dalik> boot
[04:24] <LjL> !pastebin | Dalik
[04:24] <ubotu> Dalik: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:24] <rbrtoclto> I don't see any messages from grub being displayed
[04:24] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: have you tried changing your boot lines and removing 'splash' ?
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: boot up, when GRUB comes up, hit 'e', select the boot line, remove 'splash' and hit 'b' to boot that option
[04:25] <normie> Dalik, mine looks the same except root is (hd2,0) and root= is /dev/hdd1
[04:25] <rbrtoclto> King: grub doesn't come up
[04:25] <normie> which should be correct
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: oh hmm
[04:25] <Ayabara> Kingsqueak, I'm not very used to changing video drivers, but I think I should be able to fumble my way to an ok result. I'll surf for some more info before I try anything :-)
[04:25] <Dalik> normie, where is the path pointing too for your kernel? it should be pointing too /dev/hdd1
[04:25] <rbrtoclto> I chose mostly defaults, installed grub to hd0
[04:25] <Dalik> try (hd3,0)
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> Ayabara: it won't do damage to your system per se, it will just be tedious to fix if it doesn't work is all
[04:25] <Dalik> normie, try (hd3,0)
=== ksyms is now known as rw
[04:26] <rbrtoclto> King: I can't even boot from the first hdd using the live cd
[04:26] <normie> Dalik, it is - let me just make a doc containing different conf-files and upload it :)
[04:26] <Dalik> k
[04:26] <sioux> people what kind of loca can i see when a kernel crash happen? My dell C600 with edgy crash each time I plug a usb device.
[04:26] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: not sure what to tell you there
[04:26] <rbrtoclto> :(
[04:26] <kimmern> Hey! I have a intel 82852/855GM chipset, and can't get direct rendering working..when I run glxinfo |grep dri I only get:
[04:26] <kimmern> libGL error: InitDriver failed
[04:26] <kimmern> libGL error: reverting to (slow) indirect rendering
[04:27] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: the install worked and completed o.k.?  Did you do any manual overrides of partitions or just a default install?
[04:27] <rbrtoclto> hmm weird
[04:27] <Dalik> normie, your boot partition should be (hd0,0)
[04:27] <rbrtoclto> I just unplugged the two sata drives I had connected in addition to hda, and it's booting..
[04:27] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: ahh , maybe a hardware issue, I was wondering that
[04:28] <Dalik> normie, this will of course trash your windows MBR
[04:28] <beasty> pann
[04:28] <normie> Dalik, that's crashed already, let me try that ;)
[04:28] <airgrace> jrib, hey man,
[04:28] <rbrtoclto> King: maybe grub is getting confused?  the two sata drives are brand new
[04:28] <jrib> airgrace: hi
[04:28] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: they were on the system during the install or you added them after?
[04:28] <airgrace> jrib, sorry i couldn't log in to ubuntu after restart,
[04:28] <Dalik> normie, ok
[04:29] <airgrace> jrib, i was getting some sort of "x-server" error
[04:29] <jrib> airgrace: try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[04:29] <airgrace> jrib, it wouldn't load the visual gui at all
[04:29] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: the system may be loading the drives in a different order, as in it is detecting the wrong drive as the first drive
[04:29] <rbrtoclto> king: they were there during the install, I didn't choose mount points for them though because I'll manually set them up as a mirrored software raid later
[04:29] <airgrace> jrib, yeah, i got the whole thing sorted out now, i got edgy all installed and running properly now.
[04:29] <jrib> airgrace: ah ok, great
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: I know you don't want to hear this, but if you do an install, try partitioning/labeling them and see if that fixes it
[04:30] <airgrace> jrib, yeah, take sometime, but hopefully it was worth it.
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: you can undo that later, just give them a fake name
[04:30] <znull> ear
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: like /foo and /bar
[04:30] <imc_> Think it's safe to upgrade with a sources and apt-get update then dist-upgrade yet on an Intel notebook?
[04:30] <jdahm> Im trying to install airport-utils but there seems to be a file missing from the package (AirportBaseStationConfiguration.jar) and I cant find it anywhere, even in the source and .tar.gz packages...
[04:30] <imc_> dapper->edgy
[04:30] <jdahm> is there any way to get the package working?
[04:30] <rbrtoclto> king: why do you think that would help?  grub would be given some extra configuration saying "don't boot from these"?
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: where I'm going with that is that the partitions are mounted via UUID now after install, if you label those other drives, it might sneak them by the system until you can deal with them after install
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: ah, good point
[04:31] <airgrace> jrib, but yeah, thanks a lot for your help, very much appreciate it. Thanks bud
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: grub shouldn't care
[04:31] <rbrtoclto> it's not even getting that far :(
[04:31] <rbrtoclto> yeah
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: if you boot the live cd, any hints as to what drive numbers are seen on the system, maybe you can change the labels in menu.lst based on that?
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: I wonder, did GRUB not install on the boot device in mbr maybe?
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> maybe that's what happened
[04:32] <airgrace> jrib, btw where can i learn more about the 'sudo, aptitude'etc commands?
[04:33] <jrib> !sudo > airgrace
[04:33] <jrib> !cli > airgrace
[04:33] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: does your BIOS let you pick boot devices, try switching to each drive and see if it finds GRUB one the wrong one
[04:33] <airgrace> jrib, perfect, cheers!
[04:33] <rbrtoclto> King: I was going to try the BIOS thing next reboot
[04:33] <jrib> airgrace: do you know about man pages and /usr/share/doc ?
[04:33] <rbrtoclto> King: right now I'm onto getting native res on this LCD :)
[04:33] <airgrace> jrib, afraid not
[04:33] <airgrace> jrib, i am very new to the linux system.
[04:34] <sioux> :-( edgy on my laptop dell c600 crash after plugged a usb disk. who can help me?
[04:34] <rbrtoclto> King: the live cd sees hda, sda and sdb, hda should be the primary boot device/drive in the BIOS but I'll double check
[04:34] <Kingsqueak> rbrtoclto: k, another thing, may not be your issue, I have a Dell LCD at work where during bootup I'm 'blind' until X comes up, console modes don't work with it
[04:34] <rbrtoclto> maybe SATA drives get higher priority or something, I don't know..
[04:34] <sioux> the usb disk is correctly mounted but afters some use the edgy crash :-(
[04:34] <jrib> airgrace: well if you use the "man" command, you get a manual page for (should be all) commands.  For example, try 'man aptitude'.  Also, if you view the /usr/share/doc/package_name folder, there will usually be useful stuff in there too.  Especially README.Debian files sometimes
[04:35] <jrib> airgrace: 'man intro' is useful if you are starting out too.  the letter 'q' quits by the way
[04:35] <airgrace> jrib, sure thing, i'll check it out now.
[04:35] <rbrtoclto> King: the bootsplash displays now :)  it was just the SATA thing.. but I couldn't get native res using the gma900 (even with 915resolution tool), so I've installed a cheap nvidia card

[04:41] <Kingsqueak> Abst: if you do that...consider that you might have something in plain text on your screen you may not want 'published'
[04:41] <aymnmz> bonjour normie, veux-tu m'aider ?
[04:41] <normie> aymnmz, i doubt it :)
[04:41] <Abst> Kingsqueak, Already done, know an application?
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> Abst: I'm not sure if there is an app that does it, would be simple to script, but it's a Bad Idea IMO
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> Abst: I don't , sorry
[04:42] <confusco> I'm sure there are some
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> Abst: the 'import' command does it, write a script to import root, sleep, then ftp it
[04:42] <webben> aymnmz, peut-etre utilizer #ubuntu-fr ?
[04:42] <aymnmz> why everybody speaks in english ?
[04:42] <Dalik> normie, ok this should work, find out what drive your linux is installed on and find out what that is in grub terms. (e.g. hd4) replace the root with (hd4,0)
[04:43] <LjL> aymnmz: because this is an english-speaking channel. there are national channels as well, like #ubuntu-fr
[04:43] <aymnmz> webben : yes thet's what I wanted to do
[04:43] <Yasuo> hi, someone got musicformasses to work? it complains about missing msvcr80.dll
[04:43] <Dalik> normie, if that fails reconfigure, or reinstall grub and overwrite the MBR again
[04:43] <normie> Dalik, scroll down in configs.txt you'll find my default.map which contains (hd2,0)    /dev/hdd :)
[04:43] <aymnmz> I don't understand why I'm here...
[04:43] <webben> aymnmz, donc /join #ubuntu-fr
[04:43] <Dalik> normie, k
[04:43] <aymnmz> ok, thanks
[04:43] <KnottyMan> is there a method to control the order controllers get loaded?  I have three SCSI controllers and I need them to load in a certain order to get the lettering correct.
[04:43] <cmweb-admin> Does any one know know to make a program run three times after a successful dialup?
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: run the commands in a script, call that script from the dialer if it has the option for post-connect scripts?
[04:44] <Dalik> normie, hmmm
[04:44] <normie> Dalik, i totally agree! ;)
[04:44] <Dalik> normie, can you confirm that hd2,0 is the boot partition ? :)
[04:45] <normie> Dalik, i can :)
[04:45] <archangelpetro> how do i play wmv9 files?
[04:45] <cmweb-admin> Kingsweak, the ting is im no good at scripting so thats the downfall of that operation
[04:45] <archangelpetro> well
[04:45] <archangelpetro> get the wmv 9 codec? on amd64
[04:45] <jrib> !wmv > archangelpetro
[04:45] <Yasuo> wine complains about missing msvcr80.dll, but wont accept the file if placed in directory of the app
[04:45] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: if I showed you how to write the script, would you know how to get the dialer to run it?  I don't know much about dialer apps
[04:46] <Dalik> normie, can you confirm that the vmlinuz image matches what it says in the menu.list file? :)
[04:46] <archangelpetro> ty
[04:46] <jrib> archangelpetro: for amd64, your best option might be to use the latest mplayer (not sure if the repo version has this).  It has a codec for wmv built-in I think
[04:46] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, i would figure some way
[04:46] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin:  'for ((i=0;i<3;i++)) ; do <your command> ; done'  will run <your command> three times
[04:47] <cmweb-admin> Kingqueak, thanks
[04:47] <archangelpetro> ok thanks jrib
[04:49] <confusco> anybody knowledgeable about wifi drivers here, specifically prism54?
[04:49] <normie> Dalik, i've included output of ls -al /boot in the bottom of the configs.txt and the file names match as far as i can see

[04:49] <confusco> heh
[04:49] <Kingsqueak> yeah the bot is smarter than me heh
[04:50] <confusco> unfortunately it's no help
[04:50] <Kingsqueak> confusco: ask specific questions then
[04:50] <confusco> I have no "specific" questions
[04:50] <confusco> it's a lot of questions, big problems
[04:50] <Kingsqueak> confusco: well, how far have you got with it?
[04:50] <confusco> heh
[04:51] <Kingsqueak> confusco: e.g. do you know if your driver is loaded, do you see eth1 or wlan0 etc.?
[04:51] <confusco> well if you can't help much, then nevermind
[04:51] <confusco> no I do not
[04:51] <Dalik> normie, very interesting, did you try reinstalling the kernel?
[04:51] <confusco> I made a post on the forum, I could link to that if anybody here is knowledgeable about that
[04:51] <normie> Dalik, i ran the installation 3 - 4 times, yes - it's really confusing me :(
[04:51] <Kingsqueak> confusco: well, that means your driver isn't even loaded, so that narrows it for a first step
[04:52] <Cybernd> q: just startet with ubuntu 6.10. installed mc from universe, but it seems to use the wrong character set (lines are displayed with  symbols). any idea, where to start?
[04:52] <confusco> what's mc?
[04:52] <Dalik> normie, take out all of your drives but the windows disk and re run it, if that fails just remove the windows disk and try again, if that fails still take out all the disk and forget windows :)
[04:52] <Cybernd> confusco mc ? midnight commander
[04:52] <Cybernd> mc = :o)
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> Cybernd: running in console or an xterm?
[04:52] <Dalik> normie, sorry take out the windows disk and reinstall ubuntu
[04:52] <cmweb-admin> Kingsueak, can you put this page into english for a noobie please http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=66500

[04:53] <Stonekeeper> hi. Has anyone successfully configured an ICE1712 card? I can see the meters moving in envy24 but nothing comes out of the speakers. If I do prefs->sound and click "test" for alsa, I hear the test. But nothing else comes out. I've set it as the default soundcard too...
[04:53] <normie> Dalik, haha, well, i just switched boot order and can easily boot windows now - will try disconnecting the windows disk and reinstalling since i don't need boot menu or anything, will just change boot order when i need windows instead :)
[04:53] <acab_> i've a problem with mandvd... nobody know this program?
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> Cybernd: o.k. in console or through an xterm? what are you viewing it through...try changing the font in that
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: looking
[04:53] <qc_> i hooked a digital camera up to ubuntu VIA usb - how do i find it and get the pictures inside???
[04:53] <Dalik> normie, if you dont want to do that, run the grub setup yourself and see how that goes
[04:53] <cmweb-admin> Kingsueak, :)
[04:54] <Dalik> normie, way past my bed time, good luck sorry I couldnt help.
[04:54] <normie> Dalik, i'll try it - messing with grub seems to be the only way
[04:54] <normie> oh god, i miss lilo ;)
[04:54] <normie> Dalik, no problem, thanks for your time :)
[04:54] <Cybernd> Kingsqueak through windows-putty. its the first remote machine displaying a wrong character set in mc. (before i used debian, and there it was ok)
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: o.k. so this is another question right, not about your wireless?
[04:55] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueak, hu, thats about wireless crud....
[04:55] <Kingsqueak> Cybernd: when you log into the machine, try this    export LANG=C   then run mc

[04:55] <livecda> hi, how do I change my screen lines/resolution (in console mode?)
[04:55] <livecda> i'm using a lcd with a native res of 1280x1024, looks blurred in default
[04:55] <Cybernd> Kingsqueak worked well :o) thx
[04:55] <cmweb-admin> kingsueak, see i cant even inturpret the crud
[04:55] <FireCat> Anyone remember the kernel parameter to boot to text mode?
[04:55] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: o.k. wireless is a seperate issue from that post, the reason I say that is, your interface needs to be loaded before you can get into /etc/network/interfaces file and do anything with it
[04:56] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: that file is where you define interfaces in Debian/Ubuntu similar to /etc/sysconfig/network* in RH based systems
[04:56] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: but your wireless driver isn't loaded, so you can't make an entry in that file that will do anything
[04:56] <xst> Are there any easy way to install flash player 9 on edgy?
[04:56] <Cybernd> Kingsqueak is it standard for ubuntu to run with utf8?
[04:56] <Kingsqueak> Cybernd: yup ;-)
[04:57] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueaak, I dont have wireless, im on ethernet and dialup
[04:57] <Cybernd> then i think it might be the better idea to use an utf-8 enabled client
[04:57] <testi> re

[04:57] <testi> nerv
[04:57] <testi> english
[04:58] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: o.k. so, 'man interfaces' will explain a lot of that, basically you name an interface , whether it's auto on boot or not and how it gets an address, dhcp or static.

[04:59] <livecda> hi, how do I change my screen lines/resolution in console mode? I'm using a LCD with 1280x1024 native res and it doesn't look right
[04:59] <cmweb-admin> kingsueak, nvm il wait till the next upgraade my script has comming, this is getting too complicated id raather do it by hand....
=== rhoode is now known as robinhoode
[04:59] <Kingsqueak> jerp: it's not that there are issues, it's just that there are many ways to do something and you just have to learn what they are
[04:59] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: o.k.
[05:00] <livecda> hi, how do I change my screen lines/resolution in console mode? I'm using a LCD with 1280x1024 native res and it doesn't look right
[05:00] <robinhoode> Does anyone know any tools to find out if my partition table is completely corrupted?
[05:01] <LjL> livecda: "vga=ask" kernel parameter (later you can replace "ask" with the right number, which you'll find out from the menu that you should then see at boot)
[05:01] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: you can run fsck on the partitions to check them
=== klaus_ is now known as Yasu0
[05:01] <LjL> livecda: or you can use a framebuffer driver, but i don't remember the parameter for that
[05:01] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: the devices shouldn't be mounted when you run fsck though
[05:01] <livecda> LjL: ah, so it has to be done at boot time?
[05:01] <LjL> livecda: i'm not sure "vga=whatever" will allow 1280x1024 though, i don't think
[05:01] <Stonekeeper> any ideas why alsa->test will give me the test tone but no other application can be heard?
[05:02] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: Yeah, fsck didn't work for me. I got "Bad magic number in superblock"
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: k, did you try the backup blocks?
[05:02] <eracc> Grrr! 328 spam messages ... !!!
[05:02] <LjL> livecda: well no, 1) you can set it in /boot/grub/menu.lst and make it stay 2) you can set a framebuffer after boot by loading a framebuffer module and then using the "fbset" command
[05:03] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: It suggests  to use e2fsck -b 8193 <device>. I tried that, but didn't get anywhere. Any suggestions?
[05:03] <livecda> LjL: thanks! I think that's exactly what I'm looking for
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: try 8192 instead
[05:03] <yokomo> are there any packages I could get or anything I can do to have better battery life on my laptop? It's a duo core centrino...
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: if that doesn't work, not sure
[05:03] <LjL> livecda: if you can get your card's framebuffer driver to work...
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: what happened that caused this?
[05:04] <LjL> livecda: oh, check out also the "svgatextmode" package
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: also you sure you entered the device name properly as in /dev/hda1 etc?
[05:04] <umops> has anyone been able to have ubuntu connect to a remote ubuntu XDMCP? anyone be able to help be troubleshoot?
[05:04] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: I'm not sure what's been causing this. I got an Error 17 in grub the other day. Ran fsck, used it yesterday. Then last night, it frozen and I don't have a partition table!!
[05:04] <gza> Easy way to install konqueror standalone on Ubunutu?
[05:04] <robinhoode> *froze
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: ugh, yeah, not sure
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: there's an FAQ for Edgy about that I think, re error 17
[05:05] <Random_Transit> hey, i'm trying to compile GAIM-vv from source, and i'm getting an error on the ./configure that says " error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check"
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: it's on the wiki I think, I don't have the link handy, maybe someone else does
[05:05] <Random_Transit> how do i fix this?
[05:06] <cmweb-admin> Has any one got apache running with php5?
[05:06] <gza> sudo apt-get install konqueror....installs too much I think
[05:06] <jerp> random, I'm also learning that nothing's automatic with linux
[05:06] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: Hmm.. yeah, I think I'm a little passed the error 17. I think I'm in full disk recovery mode.
[05:07] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: How does one determine the block numbers, by the way?
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: basically that -b option is to use the backup boot blocks, if it can't see those, you're out of luck I think
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: well, there are 'standard' ones, they are determined by how mkfs is run
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> 8193 struck me as odd, 8192 is more 'normal' that's why I suggested that one
[05:08] <Maggotin> Hello, is there any way to install grub from live cd?
[05:08] <Aldoliel> gza, apt-get should install only what Konqueror needs, which is most of KDE
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> it's multiples so 1*8192 or 8193 maybe should be the next one
[05:08] <robinhoode> Kingsqueak: Figured as much. If it can't it to recognize the blocks, does that mean my whole disk is fucked or just my data?
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> err 2*8193
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: it means the data mainly, it could be a bad drive, but it's not necessarily so
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: basically the mapping as to what data is where is fubar
[05:09] <Aldoliel> Random_Transit, Use aMsn or wait till gaim-vv is merged into gaim proper?
[05:09] <gza> Aldoliel: yeah about 100mb of stuff, I just remember a while back that there was a way to get konqueror standalone. but no big deal
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> robinhoode: that could be caused by software glitches with the fs or a utility or it could be a bad drive

[05:40] <justin_> It would seem that my drive space is .. disapearing quick.. and I don't install anything at all..
[05:41] <xj9000> _justin, check /tmp
[05:41] <xj9000> do a du command
[05:41] <xj9000> on the terminal and find out what is so big
[05:41] <dm_> Any idea what this message means ??? sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/drivers/drivername.inf
[05:41] <dm_> err
[05:41] <justin_> xj9000: Nothing there..
[05:41] <dm_> any idea what this means  sh: /sbin/wlanctl-ng: not found
[05:41] <justin_> du?
[05:41] <justin_> ok
[05:41] <xj9000> I am checking the du command for some options just sec
[05:42] <ryanpg> is there some kind of option that I missed to turn on UUIDs?
[05:42] <justin_> What exactly does DU do? I see one big list of files.. which is bad since I am in console and cannot scroll up...
[05:42] <Kingsqueak> dm_: it's probably a script and the command it's trying to run, isn't where it should be or is expected to be
[05:42] <xj9000> _justin
[05:42] <xj9000> you can try this: du -c --max-depth 1 | sort -nr
[05:42] <justin_> xj9000: Im in the manual ;) -- thanks though, I did'nt know there was a disk usage program in Linux.. I was trying to find one hehe :D
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> dm_: check the very first line, the 'shebang'  #!/whatever  see if it's really there on your system
[05:43] <ublive> what is the boot parameter to not load X on ubuntu live? (I looked at the above url, doesn't seem to mention anything about not loading X but it wasn't made for ubuntu live either)
[05:43] <xj9000> you can also pipe it to more and have a slow listing
[05:43] <xj9000> du -c --max-depth 1 | sort -nr | more
[05:43] <xj9000> anyone have wpasupplicant help out there
[05:43] <xj9000> i'd like my laptop to get on my wpa access point
[05:43] <kjetilho> what are the dependencies for nautilus in Ubuntu?  can I replace gamin with fam?
[05:43] <xj9000> seems like there are lots of different ways of playing around with it
[05:43] <xj9000> wpagui
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: which release of Ubuntu?
[05:44] <xj9000> wpa supplicant
[05:44] <wilczex> anyone from poland?:)
[05:44] <xj9000> dapper
[05:44] <dm_> kingsqueak its for airsnort
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: I would recommend you install network-manager and network-manager-gnome, go into /etc/network/interfaces and comment out all but the lo interface, disable any other wlan anything in /etc/init.d, reboot and you will see the networks
[05:44] <dm_> kingsqueak i dont think my wifi card is installed properly
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> dm_: ah k
[05:45] <dm_> kingsqueak ah nm, i had the wifi switch off lol
[05:45] <tom47> kjetilho you can find the dependancies in the synaptic listing for the package (right click > properties)
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: oh skipped one step, you need to run nm-applet after you reboot into gnome
[05:45] <xj9000> whoops, its edgy
[05:45] <xj9000> not dapper
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: that one handles wpa
[05:45] <xj9000> dapper is what I am on now
[05:45] <xj9000> and my laptop is edgy
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: Edgy comes with it installed already I think
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: run 'nm-applet'
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: it will pop up a little icon in the system tray
[05:46] <xj9000> yes, I have the icon
[05:46] <xj9000> two computers and a red x
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: o.k. you sure your driver is loaded for the wireless?   ifconfig -a   should show the interface if it is
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: eth1 or wlan0 etc
[05:47] <xj9000> the yeah, it worked fine with WEP
[05:47] <kjetilho> is there a web interface for exploring Ubuntu package dependencies?
[05:47] <xj9000> but since I moved to WPA
[05:47] <xj9000> it isn't
[05:47] <xj9000> I think I have to mess with wpasupplicant
[05:47] <kjetilho> tom47: I'm running Fedora Core and am considering switching :)
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: nah, you probably aren't entering the right settings for it
[05:47] <xj9000> eth1 is the interface
[05:47] <xj9000> ipw2200
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: it does the wpa stuff for you underneath
[05:48] <itrebal> anyone know of a method to discover which drive actually is a DVD reader?
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> yeah I have a Dell with that same interface, it should just figure out wpa for you
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: likely one of your options for the connection isn't right
[05:48] <Pupeno> !mp3

[05:48] <xj9000> so I am going to enter it in as a hexidecimal pass
[05:48] <xj9000> and give it a go
[05:48] <Dominus_Suus> After upgrading to Edgy my DRI's fried on my Intel graphics (laptop)
[05:49] <Dominus_Suus> I can't find anything to fix it
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: if you install some of the other wlan* stuff it can interfere with network-manager just so you know
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: if you have, you need to uninstall the ones you did and do some cleanup of /etc/network/interfaces
[05:50] <tom47> kjetilho http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/edgy/gnome/nautilus
[05:50] <xj9000> that's probably what is the problem then
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: wifi-radar for one will interfere badly
[05:50] <xj9000> because I did install wlan stuff
[05:50] <xj9000> for a usb wifi card
[05:50] <xj9000> wlan0 was the interface for that
[05:50] <sliorda> hi people, does someone here know anything about postfix? I want to relay email through my server but i can't telnet it :(
[05:50] <xj9000> okay then, thanks for the help
[05:50] <xj9000> I am going to dig around
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: start by looking at /etc/network/interfaces  comment out all but the 'lo' lines
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: then try a reboot
[05:50] <xj9000> will the network manager recreate all of that?
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: it handles all of it in the background
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: basically you use it for all your networking
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: it will do your hardwire and wireless
[05:51] <xj9000> well, I have been running all custom scripts in the past
[05:51] <|mp|> I have a Firewire Ext. HDD connected to a PCMCIA card, the controller is detected, but the HDD is not automounting or even found?? Any ideas?
[05:51] <xj9000> but when things change around
[05:51] <xj9000> I have to refigure it all out
[05:51] <kjetilho> tom47: thanks!
[05:51] <xj9000> I was hoping that newer ubuntu distros will have it all figured out
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: I use nm to hop between work wired/wireless and home wired/wireless, all dhcp and it just works
[05:51] <xj9000> I saw that they are trying to get network location managers up and running
[05:51] <xj9000> like os x
[05:52] <Kingsqueak> xj9000: yeah that's the basic idea
[05:52] <gumpish> WTF is with Rhythmbox? The window will grow to many times the width of my display in order to fit the title of the file/stream it's playing!!!
[05:52] <kjetilho> tom47: excellent, it depends on fam, not gamin :-)
[05:52] <Dominus_Suus> could anybody please help me with dri on edgy (intel graphics chip)
[05:52] <xj9000> sweet
[05:52] <xj9000> see you guys later
[05:53] <tom47> kjettilho nw .... glad to help
[05:53] <itrebal> I've got 2 cdrom drives, one of them has a /dev/cdrom symlink, but I'm not suer how to find the other one, I'd tried hdb, hdc and hdd, but those arn't working [device doesn't exist]  any ways to find my other drive?
[05:53] <tom_> where can i configure ubuntu to use dual screen?
[05:54] <kjetilho> itrebal: head /proc/ide/*/model
[05:54] <itrebal> kjetilho: thanks!
[05:55] <kjetilho> itrebal: might be useful to rummage around in /proc/sys/dev too
[05:55] <ryanpg> how bout this... does edgy default to using UUIDs or not?
[05:56] <itrebal> kjetilho: it sees it as hdc, but as an ide-cdrom - should that be dvdrom or something else?
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> this is very cool btw, it uses PAM to authenticate your gnome-keyring when you log in so network-manager doesn't ask you for your password  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=192281   Edgy doesn't need the compile done, you just install the pam-keyring package and it will work.  You just need to make the gdm config entries for pam.d
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> your keyring password *must* be your login password too though
[05:56] <grndslm> gumpish, that's a feature of gnome
[05:57] <tom47> ryanpg has done in the edgy fstab's i have seen but thats not many
[05:57] <itrebal> kjetilho: its looking more and more like it doesn't know how to use it, is there a package or *something* to see it as a DVD drive?
[05:58] <dorto> how to check if a port in edgy is open or not for incoming tcp connections?
[05:58] <itrebal> (as /dev/hdc does exists)
[05:58] <gumpish> grndslm: I see. Is it a "feature" that can be deactivated?
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> dorto: 'netstat -an' will show you listening ports
[05:58] <ryanpg> I installed subversion... but I have no svn what's going on here?
[05:58] <dorto> k, thx
[05:58] <grndslm> gumpish, not that i'm aware of
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> dorto: also  'lsof -i tcp'  and 'lsof -i udp'
[05:58] <gumpish> wow.
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> dorto: that shows you the application that is on the port
=== igor is now known as igcek
[05:59] <kjetilho> itrebal: no, ide-cdrom is correct even for DVD-RW (which is what I have)
[05:59] <dorto> okie
[05:59] <grndslm> i do agree that the windows should be a little more enhanced about the sizing of windows in the window list, tho
[05:59] <gumpish> Well, is there a Rhythmbox option that gives the window a static title so it doesn't change constantly?
[06:00] <grndslm> ehh...i wouldn't know, i don't use Rhythymbox
[06:00] <Dominus_Suus> does anybody know how to enable dri on an Intel graphics chipset in Edgy?
[06:00] <dorto> when I first started azureus, it walked me through setup wizard. Then vanished after completion. Now it is starting, showing the window and then vanishing again.
[06:00] <gumpish> =/ well sadly it's the default audio player
[06:00] <rafaguap> good afternoon!
[06:00] <gumpish> Meh. I suppose I should see about running WindowMaker anyway.
[06:00] <grndslm> gumpish, i hear some people like banshee better
[06:00] <grndslm> i use Listen when it's not so buggy, or beep-media-player
[06:00] <gumpish> never heard of it - I'll check it out thanks
[06:01] <grndslm> no prob
[06:01] <atrus> gumpish: specifically it's a bugful feature of metacity. replace your window manager and you're set. the rest of gnome is fine.
[06:01] <gumpish> i see
[06:01] <grndslm> and get a new music player
[06:01] <gumpish> heh
[06:01] <grndslm> and THEN you're good
[06:01] <dorto> rhythmbox and bmp are more stable. listen has more fancy features ;)
[06:01] <atrus> gumpish: i've always found openbox to go really well with gnome. and rhythmbox just rules, period.
[06:01] <grndslm> yea...listen's not totally stable, i prolly should go back to banhsee or somethin
[06:01] <atrus> gumpish: do you see that behavior with websites with really long titles too?
[06:02] <gumpish> atrus: now that you mention it, no i don't
[06:02] <atrus> gumpish: hmmm. might actually be a rhythmbox issue then.
[06:02] <Jahman> hi
[06:03] <bitzero> yo guys, Im making some tests here, and i just insalled windows vista and then ubuntu, but on the boot menu, there is no option to star windows, is there a way to fix it ?
[06:03] <alex1982> ok quick question: I tried to install JDK 1.5 docs , the installation didn't work , but now every time I try to install anything else it also tries to install the JDK docs. I suppose there is a file that has the queue of files to be installed. Where is that so that I can edit the JDK docs out ?
[06:03] <leafw> any recommendations to view a .flv movie ?
[06:04] <VigoFusion> I couldnt get (whatever) to play a stream, the name want long, but was or may have been WMA, I gave ujpo and went back to working on the Onboard ATI 200 doohikey
[06:04] <leafw> wow, vlc out-of-the-box worked!
[06:05] <cpl-tnt44> [17179574.392000]  Kernal panic - not syncing :VFS :unable to mount root fs on unknow - block (0,0)
[06:05] <cpl-tnt44> how do i solve this ?
[06:07] <cpl-tnt44> I recently changed the grub menu order , after chaging im getting this error and cant boot my 27 kernel linux ... only 26 and down  The Problem states : [17179574.392000]  Kernal panic - not syncing :VFS :unable to mount root fs on unknow - block (0,0)
[06:07] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: what drive is linux installed on?  Might be trying to boot from the wrong partition
[06:07] <cpl-tnt44> Kingquaeak on a diffrent paratition offcourse
[06:07] <cpl-tnt44> linux has its own fs
[06:07] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: then set the entry to the right one ;-)
[06:08] <rafaguap> Guys: please tell me how to get back my usb memory key (vfat system) recognized as well as my wireless: i must put acpi=force to kernel 2.6.15-27 in order to have wireless recognized, but then usb key is not seen anymore..  (dapper on a laptop packard bell easynote R1983)
[06:08] <cpl-tnt44> i have , but im still getting this error
[06:08] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: boot from a live CD or in another kernel and check the hd() setting for that entry
[06:08] <wasabi_> The problem is the root="" option passed to the kernel.
[06:08] <wasabi_> It's wrong.
[06:08] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: the hd() setting should match your other kernels
[06:08] <Virtuall> cpl-tnt44, have you changed initrd image too?
[06:09] <cpl-tnt44> i'v played a little with the menu.lst file on /boot/grub
[06:09] <wasabi_> cpl-tnt44: The problem is the "root" option being passed to the kernel. It is currently wrong.
[06:09] <cpl-tnt44> changed groot= .... and order on windows and other kernals ...
[06:09] <wasabi_> Whether you changed it, or whatever, I don't know.
[06:09] <cpl-tnt44> wasabi
[06:10] <cpl-tnt44> can u write down the right command?
[06:10] <wasabi_> No. Because it's different for everybody.
[06:10] <gmitchel> guys, I've got most of the "hard" stuff working on my new 6.10 mythtv box, but i can't get any sound from the onboard ALC850... lsmod and lspci seem to return the proper stuff... atiixp drivers installed, etc... alsamixer settings look fine; any ideas?
[06:10] <cpl-tnt44> or maybe send me your grub file ?
[06:10] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: in menu.lst copy the lines from the working kernels
[06:10] <cpl-tnt44> wasabi i know
[06:10] <cpl-tnt44> but i think i have something there missing
[06:10] <wasabi_> cpl-tnt44: Your grub is loading fine, your kernel is loading fine, but hte kernel cannot find the root partition... You should verify that the path you passto it (root=) is in fact correct.
[06:10] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: you said a 26 works, just look at the line for that one
[06:10] <cpl-tnt44> King i'll try that
=== Fire|Ball is now known as illu45
[06:10] <transgress_> okay i still am having the problem of, after running for a long time, ubuntu won't let me use a keyboard
=== heikki_ is now known as Raging_Hog
[06:11] <transgress_> it will just take no keyboard input
[06:11] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: the difference will be the name of the kernel and initrd, so make those match the 27
[06:11] <maxkelley> Does anyone use the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 2.0 with linux?
[06:11] <cpl-tnt44> King i'll give it a try
[06:11] <transgress_> this is a rather big problem
[06:11] <wasabi_> Kingsqueak: You are giving him incorrect advice. He's previously stated his kernel loads fine.
[06:11] <Raging_Hog> Upgrading Dapper to Efty. There's apache & php compiled from source, what will happen to them?
[06:11] <cpl-tnt44> i'll be back in a jiffy and tell u if it worked
[06:11] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: his other kernels do, so if he simply copies the entries for those with the 27 filenames, he'll be set
[06:12] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: simpler to explain
[06:12] <wasabi_> Nope, he's said his current one works fine.
[06:12] <wasabi_> It is the kernel itself which is printing out "Unable to mount root"
[06:12] <wasabi_> Hence, the kernel is loading fine.
[06:12] <alecjw> is there a command to make ubuntu hibernate that i can do in the terminal?
[06:12] <Virtuall> Raging_Hog, are they installed as packages too?
[06:12] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: I know that, but if he looks at the other entries, he'll see the root= difference
[06:12] <Raging_Hog> Virtuall, no
[06:12] <transgress_> i even tried plugging another keyboard into it
[06:12] <transgress_> that wouldn't work either
[06:12] <Dominus_Suus> could somebody please help me figure out why dri on my intel graphics chip is broken?
[06:12] <transgress_> but it was a keyboard/mouse combo and the mouse worked fine
[06:13] <wasabi_> Sure, but that's not what you said a minute ago. ;)
[06:13] <dorto> any suggestions how to track what could possibly be making azureus crash during startup?
[06:13] <dorto> not even a bug report is generated...
[06:13] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: it's just a round-about way to get him to repair the entry
[06:13] <Virtuall> Raging_Hog, then i'd say nothing
[06:13] <LjL> Raging_Hog, if they were installed - as they should - out of the way of /usr, there shouldn't be a problem
[06:13] <LjL> Raging_Hog: (that is, in /usr/local or /opt)
[06:13] <Raging_Hog> LjL, they're in /usr/local
[06:13] <wasabi_> I guess. You told him to look at kernel and initrd.... not root
[06:14] <LjL> Raging_Hog: then you should be fine - except of course that they might stop working if they require specific versions of stuff that changed in edgy...
[06:14] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: nah yer right, I thought they were on the same line
[06:14] <Kingsqueak> wasabi_: just looked
[06:14] <transgress_> anyone else using ubuntu64 on a lappy?  does their keyboard ever quit?
[06:15] <alecjw> is there a command to make ubuntu hibernate that i can do in the terminal?
[06:15] <johso> hiya. I just deleted a bunch of video files on a fat32 drive, and then I emptyed the trash can. problem is, I didn't get more disk space! if I delete other stuff, the disk updates fine, so it seems like they are still there, but I can't see them anywhere. any ideas?
[06:16] <Kingsqueak> alecjw: apt-cache search hibernate
[06:16] <Kingsqueak> alecjw: the package is 'hibernate'
[06:16] <alecjw> Kingsqueak:
[06:16] <alecjw> cheers
[06:16] <LjL> Kingsqueak: sure it works correctly on ubuntu?
[06:16] <LjL> i think Gnome's and KDE's hibernate routines call different things
[06:16] <Kingsqueak> LjL: hibernate, nope...but it's there
[06:17] <LjL> well yeah, won't hurt to try it i suppose
[06:17] <leafw> LjL : I bet, kubuntu works and ubuntu fails at putting my laptop to sleep
[06:17] <LjL> leafw: sort of the opposite for me :)
[06:17] <tom47> works for me
[06:17] <cmweb-admin> Can any one tell me what the php5 package for ubuntu is, i got all the ones i know instaalled but i still get an error when running a php script( fire fox calls them phtml filels)
[06:17] <Kingsqueak> LjL: I've never got it working fully, I honestly just shutdown anyway
[06:17] <leafw> LjL : I wish it worked in both
[06:17] <Kingsqueak> hot docking/undocking is the one I wish I could get straight
[06:17] <LjL> cmweb-admin: it's "php5"
[06:18] <VigoFusion> johso: did you delete the files or the filenames?
[06:18] <cmweb-admin> ljl, i got it instaalled but still
[06:18] <Kingsqueak> toggling between the ATi and Nvidia of dock vs laptop screws me up
[06:18] <Kingsqueak> I can undock, but not dock once the laptop is already running
[06:18] <LjL> cmweb-admin, have you set the php files as executable?
[06:19] <cmweb-admin> ljl, Hm, that may be the reaason let me check
[06:19] <neoncode> How do I change the passwords of other users from the command-line?
[06:19] <LjL> neoncode: sudo passwd <username>
[06:19] <cmweb-admin> ljl, they are all 777 so yes they are exicutable
[06:19] <neoncode> LjL: Damn, I wish I'd tried that. Thanks!
[06:20] <LjL> cmweb-admin: have you done whatever the docs (/usr/share/something) says to do to enable php? i think you need to make a symlink or two in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
[06:21] <cmweb-admin> ljl, if so i have no idea what to do, im slowly learning this. do you know the exact name of the instructions file
[06:21] <skmidry> I need to enable SATA while installing ubuntu edgy on my HP laptop
[06:21] <cpl-tnt44> king
[06:21] <skmidry> what steps do I need to take
[06:21] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: any luck?
[06:21] <cpl-tnt44> i dont think so
[06:21] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: I was wrong before btw, wasabi_ was right
[06:22] <cpl-tnt44> im just looking at the grub file ...\
[06:22] <carpediem> skmidry: SATA support is in there.  I just installed on a system with only a SATA II drive just last week.
[06:22] <cpl-tnt44> im just looking at the grub file ... kernal input are the same and correct
[06:22] <LjL> cmweb-admin, no, i don't have php or apache installed right now
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: it's the line for   root   that probably doesn't match
[06:22] <cpl-tnt44> what wasabi said i should change ?
[06:22] <cmweb-admin> ljl, ok but is should be in /usr/share right?
[06:22] <cpl-tnt44> wells root lines are the same
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: weird
[06:23] <wasabi_> cpl-tnt44: Wahat is the root line.
[06:23] <LjL> cmweb-admin: have you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#head-6ce180906ddbc141ef4b213f82465515a8ad3031-2 ?
[06:23] <cmweb-admin> ljl, nope :P
[06:23] <LjL> then do, might help
[06:23] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: did you mess around with your actual kernel or initrd files, also did you boot 27 before the changes?
=== hantoo is now known as hantu
[06:23] <cpl-tnt44> yeap
[06:23] <cpl-tnt44> and yeap
[06:24] <cpl-tnt44> im sorry nope i didnt messed with the kernel bcz i dunno how
[06:24] <wasabi_> cpl-tnt44: What's your kopt line say?
[06:24] <cpl-tnt44> any how it seemed fine to me , lines are the same between the 26 kernel and the 27 b
[06:24] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: I'm not sure what to tell you now, can you paste your menu.lst to the pastebin site?
[06:24] <cpl-tnt44> kopt ?
[06:24] <wasabi_> Yes. # kopt=

[06:25] <cpl-tnt44> well yeah but i dont have internet connection in the linux system since i couldnt
[06:25] <cpl-tnt44> figure out how to install wireless one
[06:25] <kkrusty> is there a console email client preinstalled with kubuntu edgy?
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: boot one of the working kernels and do it
[06:25] <cpl-tnt44> i have done it
[06:25] <cpl-tnt44> but now internet on linux anyhow
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: probably 'mail' though 'mutt' would be what I would recommend
[06:25] <salmenara> hello!
[06:25] <gmitchel> does anyone use atiixp sound driver in dapper?
[06:26] <cpl-tnt44> if i can only find my rj45...''s
[06:26] <cpl-tnt44> just a sec
[06:26] <salmenara> ppl, do you know any iptraf-like util for GNOME /  X ????
[06:26] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: yeah seeing your file would be helpful for sure
[06:26] <cmweb-admin> ljl, ok i have the mod installed but then i use /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload i get a failed error can i im you and paast it
[06:26] <phlasphy> hey all
[06:26] <kkrusty> neither is present here.. ls /usr/bin | grep mail yields kmail as the only thing that looks useful
[06:26] <cpl-tnt44> i know jsut a sec im working on it
[06:26] <cpl-tnt44> king
[06:27] <kakado> is it possible to install kernel 2.6.15 under edgy, as it has 2.6.17 - it is not in the repository
[06:27] <phlasphy> is FLAC lossless or not
[06:27] <phlasphy> i thought it was but
[06:27] <cpl-tnt44> "# is a comment in the grub menu right ?
[06:27] <gmitchel> "free lossless audio compression"
[06:27] <kkrusty> but its not console
[06:27] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: yes
[06:27] <phlasphy> gmitchel, i ripped a cd as wav then made it flac and the flacs bitrate is lower?
[06:28] <cpl-tnt44> mmmm so i dont have root defined that could be a problem ...
[06:28] <tchize> Hello, can someone help me solve this problem? I upgraded from dapper to edgy but i can't get the kernel to boot now. Neither generic nor 386. All i can still use is the old 'dapper' one. I get the splash then a black screen with blinking cursor
[06:28] <LjL> cmweb-admin, just use the pastebin...
[06:28] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: just do  'sudo apt-get install mutt'
[06:28] <cpl-tnt44> i can see i can define a groot device ...
[06:28] <cpl-tnt44> king ^^
[06:28] <cmweb-admin> ljl, .....k
[06:28] <skmidry> carpediem - my systems people installed winblows without enabling SATA support, therefore I will need to switch on SATA in BIOS before installing Edgy, right?
[06:28] <LjL> cmweb-admin, it's made for that. and that way other users can see the error as well
[06:29] <cpl-tnt44> so maybe i'll set it to groot=(hd0,2) where ths linux os is ...
[06:29] <skmidry> carpediem - I will be dual booting
[06:29] <cmweb-admin> ljl, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32767/
[06:29] <atrus> gmitchel: that's the idea. it makes it smaller without loosing any quality.
[06:29] <salmenara> ppl, do you know any iptraf-like util for GNOME /  X ????
[06:29] <LjL> cmweb-admin, you need to sudo that
[06:29] <atrus> er
[06:29] <atrus> hrm. neverminde
[06:29] <gmitchel> yeah, he left
[06:30] <cmweb-admin> om i forgot to  login to root
[06:30] <LjL> cmweb-admin: by the way, having a user named "admin" is probably not a good idea, since there is an "admin" group as well
[06:30] <cmweb-admin> 050391
[06:30] <cmweb-admin> omg
[06:30] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: does mutt work with http proxies?
[06:30] <cmweb-admin> ops
[06:30] <cpl-tnt44> king just a second bro im hooking up a connection as we speak\
[06:30] <phlasphy> oops
[06:30] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: not sure, I use it for local spools and imaps
[06:30] <cmweb-admin> UM eraase that please
[06:30] <phlasphy> so is it lossless or not
[06:30] <tchize> nobody for edgy kernel not booting?
[06:30] <gmitchel> phlasphy: the idea of compression is that is loses bitrate w/o losing quality
[06:30] <LjL> cmweb-admin: hard to do that
[06:30] <phlasphy> gmitchel, but how can it do that??
[06:30] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt44: k
[06:31] <LjL> cmweb-admin: just change your password
[06:31] <cmweb-admin> i hope no one knows what that goes to
[06:31] <cmweb-admin> whats the command
[06:31] <LjL> cmweb-admin, we could guess
[06:31] <LjL> cmweb-admin: "passwd"

[06:38] <cpl-tnt77> yeah i just saw : initrd		/boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-386
[06:38] <cpl-tnt77> u think it would solve it ?
[06:38] <cpl-tnt77> and should i add it to both kernels ?
[06:38] <LjL> cmweb-admin: ok then try "sudo apt-get --purge remove libapache2-mod-php4"
[06:38] <Kingsqueak> cpl-tnt77: add an initrd line for 27 that points to the initrd for 27

[06:41] <jayHat> kkrusty: the logic makes sense.
[06:41] <gmitchel> according to the kubuntu.org FAQ, it would be "oo-boon-too"

[06:43] <Dominus_Suus> slight - 1 min
[06:43] <kkrusty> well most people here dont use ubuntu because of the wierd name and because they're used to using redhat based distros

[06:44] <abasit> how do i add a user as admin user ?

[06:44] <Kingsqueak> abasit: 'sudo nano /etc/group'  find the line with admin:  and add the user at the end of it, if you have user foo there make it  foo,newuser

[06:44] <Dominus_Suus> slight - start by telling them at #ubuntu-doc
[06:44] <kkrusty> slight: well most people dont even use linux but if they decide to do then they have a tendency to go to fedora core etc
[06:45] <slight> Dominus_Suus, thanks
[06:45] <Dominus_Suus> np
[06:45] <jayHat> fedora core is what is left after you eat a fedora.
[06:45] <claudiu> how can i set a custom lower timeout for "apt-get update" because some repositories take forever to respond ?
[06:45] <LjL> !root | xXaNaXx, you can't do that
[06:45] <ubotu> xXaNaXx, you can't do that: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[06:45] <cpl-tnt44> king you have any clue about wireless networking ?
[06:45] <abasit> Kingsqueak, i did already, the user is a member of admin group, but it can not perform privileged operations
[06:46] <kkrusty> jayHat: i dont know what a fedora is and ive just discovered that its something edible?
[06:46] <Kingsqueak> abasit: did you log that user out and back in, group changes don't take place until you do
[06:46] <LjL> xXaNaXx: by hacking a bit, you can login as root directly (it's explained on that page). that's very, very, very much recommended against though

[06:50] <abasit> Kingsqueak, the XGL session hangs upon bootup for some time
[06:50] <Kingsqueak> abasit: I'm nvidia-beta here so it's different
[06:50] <LjL> cmweb-admin: well, first make sure that the files are there. do "ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ | grep php5" again
[06:50] <abasit> I see
[06:50] <gubluntu> does anyone know if ubuntu server will auto-output shell to serial during install? or do i need to setup it to do so
[06:51] <LjL> xXaNaXx: no, because there's no way for the system to know in advance whether a program will need root or not
[06:51] <Dominus_Suus> xxanaxx - ubuntu does that automatically whenever you try to run a restricted program

[06:51] <LjL> xXaNaXx: but the most common programs (like Synaptic) are already added to the menu with options that ask you for a root password when needed
[06:51] <abasit> Kingsqueak, nothing to do with Xgl, it 's gnome session hangs for a while
[06:51] <Kingsqueak> abasit: ahh
[06:51] <LjL> cmweb-admin: yeah, i hoped for output
[06:51] <cpl-tnt44> any one managed to load up wireless network with smc2802w ?
[06:51] <cmweb-admin> ljl, sorry nothin
[06:51] <cpl-tnt44> any one managed to load up wireless network with smc2802w >>> prism54 driver based ?
[06:51] <LjL> cmweb-admin: you're on edgy anyway aren't you?
[06:52] <cmweb-admin> no im on 6.06
[06:52] <abasit> Kingsqueak, it's saying loading WIndow Manager and hangs, I can still select menus, launch programs etc, but the dialog does not go way for gnome-session
[06:52] <xXaNaXx> i try to go to the "users" area, and it doesn't prompt for the root password, just says i don't have rights to access it
[06:52] <Kingsqueak> abasit: I've had numerous errors with Beryl/gnome and don't have any great ideas for you, what I've done is mv my home dir to another dir and start 'clean' again to kill all the gconfd and other session info
[06:52] <LjL> cmweb-admin: hmm, that might be it - i seem to recall (but i'm not 100% sure) that dapper required manual creation of the links
[06:52] <abasit> Kingsqueak, that's exactly i did, i removed my original user and re-created it again and start having more problems :)
[06:52] <cmweb-admin> ljl, i got 13 files to download before im edgy
[06:53] <Kingsqueak> abasit: yeah sorry, I've had similar issues, no great solutions
[06:53] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: do you have any idea regarding beryl on kubuntu?
[06:53] <cmweb-admin> ljl, so i need to wait.... OK im updating th rest
[06:53] <wd> how do i change my login and splash.  dl files from fo gnome art already.
[06:53] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: if your title bars disappear, it means the window manager has crashed
[06:53] <LjL> what the
[06:53] <LjL> bah
[06:54] <cpl-tnt44> who's working on wireless on ubuntu ? is there's such beast ??
[06:54] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: so what can i do to help that?
[06:54] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: try restarting beryl again by clicking on the ruby and selecting beryl as the window manager or the reload window manager option
[06:54] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: beryl is quite unstable, it works well on some of my systems and not so well on others
[06:54] <inimesekene>  I need help i have seriously messed up the permissions on everything in /home/    :(
[06:54] <alecjw> anyone know the package name of xubuntu/ubuntu's pdf viewer?
[06:54] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: ultimately, you may need to just not run it until it develops further
[06:55] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: tried that didnt work
[06:55] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: what video card are you running?
[06:55] <gubluntu> alecjw, im sure u have some choices... apt-cache search pdf

[06:55] <HighFi2k> hi. i am running ubuntu. when i minimize a program window, it disappears and i cannot restore it again because it does not appear on the task bar... anyone know what i am doing wrong or what i need to do to be able to minimize a window and still see it on the task bar?
[06:56] <stephenishere> can some one please help me :/ ive tried two channels already and no one knew what to do... :/
[06:56] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: k, not sure, it's just fairly buggy
[06:56] <gubluntu> ubotu tell alecjw about gpdf
[06:56] <stephenishere> once my pc starts to uncompress the kernal at bootup i lose picture :/
[06:56] <stephenishere> if i can get a terminal i think i can fix whats wrong
[06:56] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: running Edgy or Dapper?
[06:56] <gubluntu> ubotu tell alecjw about xpdf
[06:56] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: yeah i was guessing that its not in great shape yet. I tried xgl earlier and it looked pretty cool on my old computer.
[06:57] <tom47> HighFi2k how many windows do you have running?
[06:57] <someothernick> HighFi2k alt tab ?
[06:57] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: seems to be a bit better on my Edgy systems
[06:57] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: but it's not exactly rock solid
[06:57] <HighFi2k> tom47: 1, 2, 3, etc... it doesnt matter. when i have just 1 open, it doesnt show up on the task bar when i minimize it
[06:57] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: im running kubuntu edgy
[06:57] <tom47> ok
[06:57] <LjL> !info evince | alecjw: this is the standard one in Gnome i think

[06:58] <Kingsqueak> kkrusty: yeah, dunno what to tell you other than keep playing with it or give it up , I've done a bit of both on varying systems
[06:58] <wd> tom47, i just dl login and splash files, how do i install them?
[06:58] <HighFi2k> i can alt tab, but nothing shows up on the task bar
[06:58] <kkrusty> Kingsqueak: but im considering switching back to ubuntu 6,06
[06:58] <Kingsqueak> I gave up on my amd64 system but haven't tried again since going Edgy with it now
[06:58] <alecjw> thanks LjL
[06:58] <ragamuffin> Why do I get Permission Denied when I type /etc/resolv.conf at terminal?
[06:59] <Kingsqueak> ragamuffin: well one, it's not a command it's a file, and depending on permissions that may be why as well
[06:59] <Kingsqueak> ragamuffin: try  'sudo less /etc/resolv.conf'
[06:59] <tom47> wd sorry never looked
[06:59] <HighFi2k> tom47: any ideas?
[06:59] <ragamuffin> Kingsqueak: thanks I will try
[07:00] <LjL> Kingsqueak: just "less /etc/resolv.conf" should be fine as well, unless the permissions have been messed up with manually

[07:02] <Eleaf> Is there a command to dim a laptop display?  (iBook)
[07:02] <probins> got Timidity working - but not external Midi port (USB) - thanks for the link though Btw
[07:02] <tom47> wd is this any help??? http://noiesmo.dnsalias.net/article.php?story=20060820133641831
[07:02] <Eleaf> Before, in gnome, it was fn + f1 or f2, but now that does not work.
[07:02] <wd> tom47 thanks
[07:02] <Eleaf> There has to be some command to dim the display that this hotkey invokes.
[07:03] <LjL> probins, hardware MIDI is often a bit of a nuisance on Linux unfortunately
[07:03] <probins> yeah - finding that out
[07:03] <probins> ;o)
[07:03] <probins> seems I need to load snd_usb_audio in my kernel
[07:03] <LjL> with today's fast processors, though, timidity can be a reasonable fallback
[07:03] <utab> I am trying to print over a network printer, it takes to long, lets say 50 pages pdf document in half an hour, what is the problem
[07:03] <VigoFusion> The radio doohicky works, but the screen size is still default maybe the driver from DELL? but where to place it at,,
[07:03] <Eleaf> gar.
[07:04] <Eleaf> So you can't dim displays with the command line?
[07:04] <LjL> yeah, modprobe some random hopefully-midi-related modules until you hear something probins ;)
[07:04] <Eleaf> How does gnome do it with my laptop?
=== codingheaven is now known as whatever
[07:04] <Eleaf> ..hmm
[07:04] <probins> modprobe says FATAL: Module snd_usb_audio not found
=== whatever is now known as justone
[07:05] <LjL> probins hm try "sudo modprobe snd-usb-audio"
[07:05] <probins> same result LjL
[07:06] <probins> I've tried editing /etc/modules
[07:06] <nofxx> since I replaced my notebook cooler, it is damn slow...a crap.... now watching the system monitor....even loading heavy stuff the CPU never goes above 40%....hmm maybe some protection is f** me... something I can do with ubuntu or I should go for the bios ?
[07:06] <LjL> weird enough, it works fine here (even though i have no USB audio)
[07:06] <LjL> probins: you on Edgy?
[07:06] <probins> dapper
[07:06] <LjL> probins: well then perhaps it's not there or has a different name in dapper's kernel. dunno. try "find /lib | grep usb | grep audio"
[07:07] <LjL> or something
[07:08] <probins> I get "/lib/modules/2.6.15-26-386/kernel/sound/usb/snd-usb-audio.ko
[07:09] <LjL> hm, then i do wonder why it doesn't load
[07:09] <LjL> probins: what does "uname -r" say?

[07:19] <blanky> Heiroglyphics: what??
[07:19] <`4aFkA`> my hard disk has 1 partition.. and i don't want to make a new partition to instal ubuntu. can i instal it on that one ?
[07:19] <blanky> `4aFkA`: elaborate
[07:19] <Heiroglyphics> i need to change the user access on the account
[07:20] <blanky> `4aFkA`: you don't mind formatting that partition (as in, erasing everything on it and putting ubuntu on it)
[07:20] <mark__> '4aFkA' : you could use VMWare to make ubuntu a virtual machine. otherwise you need 2 new partitions
[07:20] <josh_> how do i add an exception to hosts.deny?
[07:20] <bradbury9> hy
[07:20] <bradbury9> i
[07:20] <blanky> `4aFkA`: why dont you wnat to make another partition? it's not that hard these days
[07:21] <bradbury9> hello!
[07:21] <blanky> this time I actually even used Gnome Partition Editor (or whatever it's called) to resize my NTFS parition
[07:21] <mixo8114> Hi
[07:21] <`4aFkA`> blanky : i have stuff on the secound partition and i don't want to erase it :/
[07:21] <LjL> blanky: let's sidestep the issue for a minute (mostly because i don't have the kernel source installed and would rather not have it ;)  -  if you type "apt-cache show sl-modem", you'll see there are already slmodem packages in Ubuntu. perhaps those will work better than the tarball?
[07:21] <blanky> `4aFkA`: second? you said you only had one
[07:22] <`4aFkA`> mark__ : tell me about VMWare
[07:22] <`4aFkA`> i was wrong sry me
[07:22] <blanky> LjL: well, I don't have internet so I doubt it's there already (or even in the CD)
[07:22] <mixo8114> i have a phillips webcam and it won't fire
[07:22] <edgy> Hi, I thought that the kernel version take the form major.minor.patch but I just take a look at kernel.org and the current version is 2.6.18.3 so what's the additional number for?
[07:22] <blanky> LjL: but, what's the site where you can download the packages from the site?
[07:22] <blanky> http://packages.ubuntu.com or something?
[07:22] <LjL> blanky: yeah
[07:22] <mixo8114> wat's the toppic
[07:23] <josh_> anyone?
[07:23] <blanky> LjL: thanks, will give that a try, hope it's not too big a file size and I get the right one haha, thanks again
[07:23] <`4aFkA`> blanky any suggestions ?
[07:23] <blanky> josh_: is this about apache? or what are you talking about

[07:23] <ubotu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
[07:23] <josh_> hosts.deny... i need to know how to add an exception to it
[07:23] <blanky> LjL: yeah I read that haha, or, honestly I only read the relevant parts because it's kind of weird
[07:23] <mark__> '4aFkA': vmware will allow you to have a guest operating system running at the same time as another OS. i run ubuntu and windows at the same time(windows for .net development). but my actual OS is ubuntu. google it up, vmwareworkstation is free for 30 days, you need that to make a VM(virtual machine), vmware player is opensource
[07:23] <LjL> i know blanky :\
[07:23] <blanky> josh_: In relation to what, apache, ssh, what?
[07:24] <josh_> i just wrote a script to add ip addresses from my auth.log* files to it automatically once a day
[07:24] <blanky> josh_: because that question might be better suited towards a specific channel

[07:26] <jrib> !fixres > Talash
[07:26] <Talash> while its native resolution is 1280x1024
[07:26] <bruenig> cntb, it is not included in default, to get it do sudo apt-get install samba
[07:26] <blanky> josh_: I'm sorry that's beyond my knowledge, what I meant was that you could probably ask in a specific channel, see if there's a channel for the language you wrote your script in (most likely)
[07:26] <cntb> philip me too wait on the row ! ;-)
[07:26] <Talash> jrib-- what?
[07:26] <bruenig> cntb, if you do actually have it, doing sudo apt-get install samba will tell you that you have it also
[07:26] <jrib> Talash: ubotu should have sent you a private message with useful information, did you receive it?
[07:26] <cntb> sudo apt-get install samba ? ok ty bruenig good

[07:28] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, is the unallocated space next to the partition and is the partition you are trying to add it to the / partition?

[07:30] <saxofoner> Can anyone help?
[07:30] <LjL> blanky: i'd get module-assistant and debhelper rather
[07:30] <icepack> Ljl: www.vmware.com/download/player/open_source.html
[07:30] <blanky> LjL: ah really? so they're base packages (becuase I haven't installed anything other than build-essential)
[07:31] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: I tried that, and it won't let me add more space to the ext3 partition.
[07:31] <blanky> LjL: it sucks when you need to get one package and then you need to get its deps, and its deps deps, and its deps deps deps hahaha
[07:31] <LjL> icepack: i don't know what that is, but it's certainly not vmware player (just look at the ridiculous size). you can also try "apt-get source vmware-player"; you'll see it's binary stuff
[07:31] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, what does it do?
[07:31] <tonquin> Hi all,  I expanded a partition with gparted and it worked but.... the partition reports that its full and gnome kicks out.  any ideas what to do next?
[07:31] <blanky> LjL: but if you think that debconf, libasound2, and libc6 are base packages, and should already be installed, then I should be fine
[07:31] <LjL> blanky: i know. someone should make a Windows tool for that ;)
[07:31] <saxofoner> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301835   Can anyone help?
[07:31] <blanky> lol
[07:32] <pradeep> saxofoner, boot with live Cd and do a fsck for /
[07:32] <LjL> blanky: i don't think, i'm sure. the only one i'm not 100% sure is libasound2 (that's why i said "yes, probably, yes"), but i'm 98% sure ;)
[07:32] <philip> bruenig: any ideas why my samba isnt working then?
[07:32] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: it just doesn't allow me to add more space, when I try to specify the new size, it sets it back to its previous size. I also tried using the arrows to add more, but the up arrow is greyed out.
[07:32] <blanky> oh so 'll just get libasound2
[07:32] <bruenig> philip, never used samba.
[07:32] <saxofoner> pradeep:  How to do an fsck?  Just do that in the terminal?
[07:32] <saxofoner> "fsck /"
[07:32] <saxofoner> ?
[07:32] <seamus7> I am about to do a fresh install of Edgy, I previously upgraded to Edgy from Dapper, my root is on its own partition, will most of my personal settings and software remain? what should I consider doing before doing this fresh install?
[07:32] <jesse__> What's Up!
[07:32] <icepack> LjL: you're right. the article i read was comparing it to open source QEMU and Xen
[07:32] <blanky> LjL: and for sl-modem-source, it needs bzip2 (i think its already installed), debhelper (i dont think), module-assistant (i dont think), and that's it, am i right?
[07:33] <pradeep> saxofoner, fsck /dev/sdx
[07:33] <m6s> hey peoplke
[07:33] <blanky> http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/misc/sl-modem-source
[07:33] <saxofoner> ok thanks pradeep
[07:33] <m6s> can I exclude a deb packet?
[07:33] <saxofoner> brb
[07:33] <blanky> LjL: by the way thanks for the help i really appreciate it
[07:33] <LjL> blanky: yeah you're right
[07:33] <m6s> in the apt-conf ?
[07:33] <m6s> Help please
[07:33] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, you are certain the unallocated space is right next to the partition you are trying to add it to and that you are using the live cd when you do this. You cannot do it in your normal install, only from the live cd.
[07:33] <LjL> blanky: though debhelper and module-assistant probably do need a few dependencies that you don't have
[07:33] <elriah> Ok, got postfix setup.  But I keep getting: Relay access denied; from=<>   in my mail.log ... any suggestions?
[07:33] <blanky> LjL: I've got that covered

[07:34] <Kingsqueak> elriah: you need to finish setting up main.cf with your options
[07:34] <jesse__> m6s:> Help with what?
[07:34] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: yes, I'm in the regular ubuntu right now, but when i tried I was in the ubuntu live cd. And yes, in the list in gparted, the unallocated space is listed just above the ext3 partition.
[07:34] <confusco> Hello?
[07:34] <m6s> jesse__,  I am trying to setup apt
[07:34] <blanky> oh man :'( I'll never finish haha
[07:34] <m6s> so to exclude some packages
[07:35] <blanky> debhelper has lots of deps
[07:35] <m6s> but I can 't find in google nothing good to use
[07:35] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, oh above.... It needs to be after the partition not before it
[07:35] <m6s> I want to exclude acpi-support from my edgy distro
[07:35] <blanky> oh well, thanks LjL I really appreciate the help! :)
[07:35] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: oh, ok. How do I move it?
[07:35] <pradeep> saxofoner, please post it on the pastebin
[07:35] <user-land> what web foto album software do you recommend ?
[07:35] <jesse__> m6s:> Ok, goto debian.org
[07:35] <pianoboy3333> I need an alternative cd ripper that uses gstreamer 0.10 -- NOT sound-juicer
[07:35] <m6s> its done
[07:35] <LjL> blanky: by the way you may want to look at "apt-zip" too for getting packages on a non-networked box a bit more easily. i've never used it though
[07:35] <elriah> Kingsqueak: I'm in main.cf ... Everything looks ok to me ... This is just an outbound SMTP server ... It doesn't handle inbound mail and doesn't forward to a smarthost and only accepts relay from 127.0.0.1/8 ... Any clue?
[07:36] <blanky> LjL: okay, I'm going to look for it
[07:36] <blanky> thanks
[07:36] <saxofoner> pradeep:  pastebin?  sorry.  Don't have a clue what that means.  I put it in a private chat message to you.
[07:36] <cntb> bruenig et al . here the result of sudo apt-get install samba .http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32775/  is everything OK there ?

[07:36] <ubotu> saxofoner: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:36] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: the resize/move option when I right click on it is greyed out.
[07:36] <LjL> saxofoner: the idea is, never paste on the channel like you just did.
[07:36] <m6s> ok
[07:36] <Kingsqueak> elriah: maybe someone is trying to connect to it, is the listener open on your interface?
[07:36] <pradeep> saxofoner, fsck /dev/sdx (where x is the partition number as in  /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 etc)
[07:36] <jesse__> m6s:>you their?
[07:36] <cntb> ljl  here the result of sudo apt-get install samba .http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32775/  is everything OK there ?
[07:36] <Kingsqueak> elriah: the log entries about relaying denied are normal if someone attempts
[07:36] <m6s> yes
[07:36] <pradeep> !pastebin > saxofoner
[07:37] <philip> is any one any good with samba?
[07:37] <Kingsqueak> elriah: they aren't normal if it is a client you intend to permit to relay though
[07:37] <LjL> cntb: doesn't look like
[07:37] <elriah> It's me attempting the relay just using telnet to test it.  It *should* allow relay from 127.0.0.1 which is localhost ...
[07:37] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, that is because you are trying to resize by adding space before the partition and not after the partition. I do not believe you are able to do that, unless you reformat the whole thing. Anyone else can confirm this?
[07:37] <pianoboy3333> I need an alternative cd ripper that uses gstreamer 0.10 -- NOT sound-juicer
[07:37] <seamus7> Hi, I'm about to do a fresh reinstall of Edgy (I'm hoping it fixes some problems after I did the upgrade from Dapper) ... my root is on its own partition so I"m assuming I won't lose most of my configurations and add-on software, anyone know what I can expect to lose in the fresh reinstallation or have any tips before I begin?
[07:37] <pradeep> saxofoner, i didn't get any private message
[07:37] <elriah> But that message pops up.
[07:37] <m6s> jesse__, yes I am there
[07:37] <saxofoner> Hmm.... sorry
[07:37] <bruenig> cntb, not sure
[07:37] <jesse__> m6s:>click on Debian Package, then click on search package directories
[07:37] <m6s> jesse__, what 's the use?
[07:38] <LjL> pradeep: not surprising, since saxofoner is not registered
[07:38] <Kingsqueak> elriah: yeah it should, can you pastebin the main.cf file?
[07:38] <bruenig> cntb, might ask someone with more in depth samba experience. I am only aware of how to install it generally
[07:38] <saxofoner> LjL sorry I'll try to do that.
[07:38] <tonquin> Hi all,  I expanded a partition with gparted and it worked but.... the partition reports that its full and gnome kicks out.  any ideas what to do next?
[07:38] <jesse__> m6s:>the idea is to find the package apt
[07:38] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: no, I know. Let me clarify, I wish to relocate the unallocated space below the ext3 partition so that I may resize the ext3 partition with that new space.
[07:38] <saxofoner> Don't remember how to register, on liveCD
[07:39] <m6s> jesse__, there is no use on that , :-)
[07:39] <LjL> saxofoner, just use the pastebin
[07:39] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, do sudo fdisk -l, paste the output, then maybe I can understand what you are saying because obviously I am misinterpreting
[07:39] <jesse__> m6s:>why do you say that?
[07:39] <LjL> !register | anyway, saxofoner
[07:39] <ubotu> anyway, saxofoner: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[07:39] <VigoFusion> I was sposed to register?
[07:39] <m6s> jesse__, I am trying to exclude packages in configuration files of apt
[07:39] <m6s> I have apt
[07:40] <jesse__> m6s:>oh!
[07:40] <jesse__> m6s:>ok
[07:40] <LjL> VigoFusion: no, but if you don't register you can't send private messages to user (unless they explicitely set an option to accept them)
[07:40] <cntb> ty anyway brue
[07:40] <jesse__> m6s:> so go to synaptic and remove the acpi package
[07:40] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32776/
[07:41] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, ok which of the /dev/sda# are you trying to merge with the other /dev/sda#
[07:41] <VigoFusion> LjL: Thank you, I dont do private messages, tghey are soo Closed Source!
[07:41] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: I'm trying to add the 2.5GB space to sda3
[07:41] <m6s> jesse__, nice shot! but, how do I do keep this package out of me?
[07:41] <m6s> ;-)
[07:41] <saxofoner> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32777/
[07:41] <LjL> VigoFusion: hehe - well registering one's nick is a good idea anyway :)
[07:41] <saxofoner> pradeep: did that work?
[07:42] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, you are trying to add sda2 to sda3?
[07:42] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: do it as root, via sudo
[07:42] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: no
[07:42] <jesse__> m6s:> I would back your system first
[07:42] <saxofoner> ofcourse
[07:42] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: it is unallocated space
[07:42] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: 'sudo fsck ...'
[07:42] <m6s> jesse__,  it erases gnome-session, is this good?
[07:42] <pradeep> saxofoner, you have to be root
[07:42] <m6s> 8-/
[07:42] <pradeep> yes
[07:42] <jesse__> no!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[07:42] <jesse__> no!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:42] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, ok I see, I didn't look at it right
[07:42] <VigoFusion> True that, will register now, hope Santy Claws still shows up though
[07:42] <m6s> ok I just did it!
[07:42] <m6s> LOL
[07:42] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, that unallocated space is between sda2 and sda3
[07:43] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: yes
[07:43] <jesse__> m6s:> Oh crap!
[07:43] <saxofoner> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32778/ pradeep
[07:43] <m6s> no panic
[07:43] <saxofoner> Finally did that right...
[07:43] <m6s> if the power supply is ok
[07:43] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, yeah, you can't add it to sda3 because it is before it on the disk. You can only add it to sda2.
[07:43] <mixo8114> wats the prob
[07:43] <jesse__> bad thing with out gnome-session, the system won't boot!
[07:43] <mixo8114> uh oh
[07:43] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: so my question is: how do I move it below ext3?
[07:43] <m6s> ni X, not console
[07:43] <saxofoner> KingSqueak:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32778/
[07:44] <jesse__> That's what I'm saying
[07:44] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: yeah that's normal, good
[07:44] <saxofoner> Oh goody.  But what good is that?
[07:44] <jesse__> m6s:>Don't you dare shut down your machine
[07:44] <saxofoner> I still have the GRUB 16 AND 18 errors... it's crap...
[07:44] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, you cannot move partitions, they are physical slices of the disk. You can reformat all of sda3 in order to get the unallocated space but that probably is not what you want. If you wish, you could just make that unallocated space another separate ext3 partition and use it for general storage
[07:45] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: you sure you ran fsck on the right partition?  do you only have one partition?
[07:45] <m6s> jesse__, lol, nope
[07:45] <jesse__> m6s:>if you do then you can't boot it back up!
[07:45] <m6s> I want excludinf deb files, if I can 't find I wont shut it
[07:45] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: that was sda6, the seventh partition, is grub loading from a different one maybe?
[07:45] <saxofoner> Kingsqueak:  Did you see this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301835  that's where my problem is, I don't know where else it would be.  I'll try some others, thanks.
[07:45] <davin> I tried to follow a tutorial which helped me install Xgl+Beryl, using my nvidia card, but when it starts, my PC locks up after 5-15 seconds, now I cant even get into GNOME. what do I do?
[07:45] <jesse__> it won't boot without the live cd
[07:46] <davin>  oh, and #beryl is dead.
[07:46] <jesse__> if you do this

[07:47] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, 99% sure. I am relaying information I have read elsewhere. I have, because of the info, always set up my partition table to allow me some flexibility (putting stuff that I might incorporate later at the end so I can just make the disk bigger). But assuming the initial thing I read was wrong, I would also be wrong.
[07:47] <jesse__> Try debian.rog
[07:47] <jesse__> Try debian.org
[07:47] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: sorry, I'm not sure, I do agree it might be a hardware issue, have you seen anything odd in /var/log/messages error wise?

[07:49] <LjL> seamus7: your root is always in its own partition - what did you mean? perhaps it's /home that you have in its own partition?
[07:49] <mamzers555> saxofoner; important!! not the first post in this thread, take a look at the second one!!!!!!
[07:50] <Kyral> jesse__: Be careful with stating that GNOME is better than KDE or vice versa :P
[07:50] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, if you reincorporated it into sda3 by deleting sda3 and then reformatting it allowing the unallocated space to become the begging of the new partition, you could then leave that same amount of unallocated space at the end of sda3 and between sda4, but not the end of the disk
[07:50] <saxofoner> kingsqueak:  I'm not exactly new, I just don't know all this stuff, because I usually don't have problems   ;-)

[07:51] <Kyral> Like Vim vs. Emacs

[07:51] <mnepton> GNOME vs KDE is one of the stupidest arguments one could possibly have
[07:51] <jesse__> i know i'm on the GNOME side
[07:51] <LjL> seamus7: ok, now that makes sense. backing up /etc is probably a good idea (it's only going to be 10 megs or so uncompressed, anyway), though don't restore it - as you said, just use it for reference. you might also want to do a "dpkg --get-selections" (and redirect it to some file) to backup the list of packages that you currently have installed, if you installed a lot of stuff that wasn't there by default, and want to restore it

[07:52] <tannerld> i uninstalled something via apt-get and all the configs and things are still there; is it possible to rid of them w/o going through one by one?
[07:52] <bruenig> seamus7, what I always do, since I do have a separate / and /home is mount my home partition in the install/live cd and then delete everything off of except my files (i.e the . directories). Then I install, manually edit the partition table and have it not reformat it.
[07:52] <Kyral> I use KDE because GNOME pissed me off with 2.14 and hiding everything in GConf
[07:52] <Kyral> But I digress
[07:52] <allz> hello i want to upgarde my nvidia card NVIDIA 87.76 to 96.26 but how ?
[07:52] <Megaqwerty> bruenig: so the only way to incorporate it into sda3 would be to reformat sda3 with that space at the beginning?
[07:52] <allz> someone PLEASE help me out :)
[07:52] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: oh   less /var/log/messages    'q' quits it and j/k scroll the file
[07:52] <kdefrysk> tannerld, sudo apt-get remove --purge next time
[07:52] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, yes
[07:52] <tannerld> kdefrysk, ah thanks
[07:52] <mnepton> come to UDS sometime and watch GNOME and KDE developers and foundation members interact. *we* don't fight, and we have a great time together. so users fighting is just ridiculous.
[07:52] <Megaqwerty> damn. ok, thanks
[07:52] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, you can only incorporate space at the end of a partition not at the beginning of it
[07:52] <jesse__> it's just use gnome because I couldn't understand the entire concept of KDE
[07:53] <sethk> mnepton, smile when you say that.
[07:53] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: shift-g  goes to the end of the file, might be more useful for later messages
[07:53] <sethk> jesse__, there's nothing fundamentally different about kde vs. gnome
[07:53] <Kyral> ...how can you not understand the concept of a DE
[07:53] <Kyral> ...and why am I getting Deja Vu?
[07:53] <mnepton> sethk: i would if it was purely funny.
[07:53] <mamzers555> saxofoner; you should use a test-cd to test your ram, harddrive and so on before doing anything else, keep sure that the hardware is ok
[07:53] <saxofoner> kingsqueak: how much of it should I post?
[07:53] <Lynoure> jesse__: What part of it? I moved from gnome as I could not understand hiding everything into gconf
[07:53] <jesse__> it's hard to explain
[07:53] <sethk> mnepton, I guess you didn't see the movie
[07:53] <davin> #ubuntu-offtopic :-0
[07:53] <saxofoner> mamzers555:  I did a memtest.
[07:53] <sethk> jesse__, it certainly must be.
[07:53] <Kyral> GConf ~= Windows Registry :D
[07:54] <mnepton> sethk: which?
[07:54] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: well do this   tail -100 /var/log/messages     pastebin that as a start
[07:54] <seamus7> bruenig: why do that? I thought having /home on its own partition allows me to easily install/upgrade/reinstall my / without having to touch /home?
[07:54] <Lynoure> davin: thanks for reminding us
[07:54] <saxofoner> and my HD is like 5 months old
[07:54] <jrs> llo how do i install my sound card?
[07:54] <tlanfer> Is it possible to have direct rendering in a ssh forwarded environment?
[07:54] <davin> Kyral: so you say I do not need Xgl on dapper, only beryl?
[07:54] <sethk> mnepton, I can't even remember.  it's an old old western, and the bad guy says "smile when you say that" with this evil grin.
[07:54] <m6s> jesse__,  bye & thanx
[07:54] <jesse__> yeh, it's the compatilbilty
[07:54] <Kyral> davin:  If you are at the newest NVidia Drivers
[07:54] <davin> Kyral: okay..
[07:54] <Kyral> Which I highly doubt with Dapper
[07:54] <jesse__> m6s:>your welcome!
[07:54] <mnepton> sethk: oh good. i thought there was incriminating video of us from UDS or something.
[07:55] <KenSentMe> I try to print a pdf in Evince with 2 pages on one. The pages however get printed one page on one page. Anyone know how to get 2 pages on one?
[07:55] <Kyral> (I dislike release based distros...)
[07:55] <davin> Kyral: well Edgy recognizes none of my 9 mice :(
[07:55] <allz> hello i want to upgarde my nvidia card NVIDIA 87.76 to 96.26 but how ?
[07:55] <bruenig> seamus7, that is what I do, so that it doesn't carry over any settings that may be incompatible. I like to reconfigure everything. Always kind of defeats the purpose at least to me to have a fresh install that is exactly the same as the other install. Perhaps I am weird in that manner, wouldn't be the only thing I am weird in.
[07:55] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell jrs about sound
[07:55] <mc__> allz: download the lates driver from nvidia.com
[07:55] <jesse__> not hardware, software compatibility
[07:55] <saxofoner> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32782/  kingsqueak
[07:55] <Kyral> allz: I highly doubt NVidia-GLX is at the new version, download the installer from NVidia
[07:55] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell allz about nvidiabeta
[07:55] <sethk> davin, that's very democratic.  Also odd.  I have a wide variety of mice here and only one isn't recognized
[07:55] <Kyral> LjL: They aren't beta anymore :D
[07:56] <kdefrysk> amaranth repo has the latest nvidia-glx
[07:56] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: k, gimme a bit
[07:56] <saxofoner> kingsqueak:  I didn't see any weird messages
[07:56] <davin> well
[07:56] <LjL> Kyral: the factoid's name is that though
[07:56] <saxofoner> but then again, I don't know how to read them!
[07:56] <jesse__> LOL
[07:56] <davin> I wanted to install Edgy, but none of the mice worked, so I installed Dapper instead
[07:57] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: hmm yeah that looks o.k.
[07:57] <saxofoner> Maybe I'll just hose my disk, and install Ubuntu by itself...
[07:57] <saxofoner> It's tempting at this point.
[07:57] <green_earz> jrs:  if there is a onboard sound card disable it in the bios. then find out what the cards driver name is. check out this link for that >http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/   then install modconf  and then fire it up and track down the driver and install it
[07:57] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: if you can do that, run a bad blocks check on the whole thing, takes forever but it's worth a check
[07:57] <allz> ljl should i add this to my source.list ?
[07:57] <jesse__> i wouldn't if i were you, you always need a back up OS
[07:58] <davin> ugh
[07:58] <allz> deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm
[07:58] <allz>  deb-src http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm
[07:58] <LjL> allz: if you want the new drivers, yes
[07:58] <allz> this?
[07:58] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: it's an odd issue you're having so I just don't have a great answer
[07:58] <saxofoner> kingsqueak:  I doubt it's hardware, because I had Windows only, before Ubuntu was installed, and it was hunky dory for a long time.
[07:58] <LjL> allz: yes
[07:58] <davin> I got a few options here
[07:58] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: you running Edgy or Dapper on this?
[07:58] <LjL> allz: then update and upgrade
[07:58] <elriah> Hi all.  I have a colo server that runs 6.06 and a development server that runs 6.06.  I want to backup from on to the other with minimal impact on bandwidth.  Is RSYNC the way to go?
[07:58] <allz> lol ljl i was gonna ask you then what
[07:58] <allz> :P
[07:58] <davin> -Fix Beryl/XGL, -Try to find out and undo everything, -Install Edgy
[07:58] <mamzers555> saxofoner; also check the cables, i have had a case where the ide-cable caused the problems
[07:58] <saxofoner> kingsqueak:  I understand you have no answer, thank you very much for your ubuntu.  I have 6.06
[07:58] <seamus7> bruenig: oh I see... that makes sense ... I was hoping my problems in Edgy since upgrading would be fixed just by reinstalling / .... could I just go into /home and delete everything except my personal directories ... I was never going to allow the reinstall to touch my /home (i.e. format).
[07:58] <saxofoner> mamzers555:  will do.
[07:59] <saxofoner> I'm just afraid to boot off.
[07:59] <LjL> allz: either "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade", or the equivalent in Synaptic, i guess
[07:59] <saxofoner> Scared the liveCD won't work!
[07:59] <Kingsqueak> saxofoner: I would say if you are going to reinstall, try Edgy and also do what mamzers555 suggested
[07:59] <saxofoner> Okey doke.  Be back soon if all goes... er... badly?
[07:59] <allz> ljl where is the source list agein :S this time i am gonna type it in notpad

[08:00] <Fred_Sambo> hello
[08:00] <elriah> Kingsqueak: Thanks!  Do you know a good faq to get me started?
[08:00] <Fred_Sambo> hello ubotu
[08:00] <Kingsqueak> elriah: read the options, you can make it archive and delete missing files on the target etc. and only send over new files or changed files
[08:00] <Kingsqueak> elriah: http://sunsite.dk/info/guides/rsync/rsync-mirroring.html  might be of some help
[08:00] <mc__> does ati support AIGLX?
[08:01] <bruenig> seamus7, it almost definitely doesn't create any problems by allowing the . directories and stuff to stay. Just reformatting / should be enough. I thought you were asking something like 'what should I backup so I can do a complete fresh install' and my answer was, well, what it was
[08:01] <elriah> Thanks again :)
[08:01] <jesse__> be back in a second
[08:01] <seamus7> bruenig: oh ok thx

[08:07] <spokkerjones> you would think theyd have make as a seperate package --- why install all the extra garbage?
[08:07] <LjL> allz: ok - so you want 96.26.  why is amaranth's package bad, since it's newer than that (96.29)?
[08:08] <manmadha> can any one tell how to remove package updates from our notifivation?

[08:15] <VigoFusion> manmadha: That way you will get the updates as needed, and there are no radical apt-remove or purges done, it is there, just idle.
[08:16] <LjL> allz: first update, then upgrade. if you did it correctly (these packages should have been updated: linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic linux-restricted-modules-common) you now have version 9629 of the nvidia drivers installed. you probably need to reboot, though.

[08:26] <rioghal> VigoFusion, i can imagine a lot of new packages making it into the repos now that java is os :)
[08:26] <grimboy> What's the command that lets you chose your favourite of a number of applications that have the same purpose?
[08:26] <dooglus> VigoFusion: SeaMonkey isn't java
[08:26] <dooglus> grimboy: update-alternatives --config
[08:27] <allz> ljl i dont think it worked when i enter  glxinfo | grep version i get NVIDIA 87.76  :S
[08:27] <grimboy> dooglus, Thanks
[08:27] <petro> wheres the best place to go to learn how to use linux
[08:27] <VigoFusion> I use alot of java in cross platform work, Paul Lutus is like my hero in that area.
[08:27] <gbrent> I am trying to disable wobbly windows hoever when I uncheck and restart my coputer they are still wobbly even though beryl settings manager shows it unchecked. Any ideas?
[08:27] <dfcarney> petro: if you're up for some reading, check out O'Reilly's books
[08:28] <SiDi> is there a version of ubuntu designed for computers older then 6 years?
[08:29] <mamzers555> gbrent; ask in #beryl
[08:29] <jrs> all versions are
[08:29] <SiDi> or should edgy work
[08:29] <grimboy> SiDi, xubuntu might do the trick
[08:29] <Kingsqueak> SiDi: how much RAM and how fast?
[08:29] <allz> someone plzzz help me .how to upgrade my nvidia ?
[08:29] <SiDi> ill try it grimboy
[08:29] <dfcarney> SiDi: edgy should work, unless you've got some rare/arcane hardware in there.  Also, consider using xubuntu
[08:29] <SiDi> ok
[08:29] <VigoFusion> I use the Care Ware license on everything I do, now I use CW and FSF  Share and Share alike.
[08:30] <honk> Is there a way to change the grid size in icon view?
[08:30] <ashika> Anyone need help?
[08:30] <mamzers555> heh
[08:30] <JeffBell> ashika, how do I install windows media player?
[08:30] <ashika> So quiet.
[08:31] <ashika> JeffBell, Use WINE to emulate the windows environment and run installer via WINE.
[08:31] <jrs> allo
[08:31] <VigoFusion> Joke is still funny
[08:32] <ashika> what joke.
[08:32] <JeffBell> ashika, since you gave an interesting answer... is WINE considered, by consensus, to be better than a VMWare solution?  I've never run either under linux.
[08:32] <grimboy> JeffBell, Depends how good your hardware is and if you want freedom-free.
[08:32] <wikityler> How can I see if Xfree86 is working?
[08:32] <JeffBell> My hardware is sufficient, grimboy.  Freedom = WINE, I take it?
[08:33] <ashika> JeffBell, VMware takes more system resources does it not?
[08:33] <honk> is there a QEMU frontend?
[08:33] <grimboy> JeffBell, Yup
[08:33] <JeffBell> ashika, I've not encountered a situation where that affects me, yet.
[08:33] <sgirc> hi all
[08:33] <ashika> JeffBell, Then its personal preference.
[08:33] <ivx> hey if i want to use cups to share a printer do i just configure it like a normal printer on the computer it is connected to then modify the config file so it will allow other computer to print to it?
[08:33] <JeffBell> No issues with stability on WINE?
[08:33] <sgirc> I'm trying to install a usb adslmodem on my edgy
[08:33] <JeffBell> (for the most part, I meant)
[08:33] <sgirc> i'm following the tuto at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/e-techV2
[08:34] <jrs> wtf
[08:34] <sgirc> but I had a problem when I type the command sudo modprobe 2684
[08:34] <mamzers555> manmadha; can you tell me, if these packages work for you?
[08:34] <sgirc> the module is not found
[08:34] <sgirc> any ideas please ?
[08:35] <manmadha> mamzers555, nope.......it is older version
[08:35] <mamzers555> manmadha; it is 2.0beta5, the latest one+
[08:35] <ashika> JeffBell, I hear for the most part it is good if set up correctly.
[08:35] <manmadha> mamzers555, ohhh ok ....1mm
[08:35] <JeffBell> Photoshop works on WINE?!  Wow, that I did not know.... that's the *only* thing holding me back from a complete migration.
[08:36] <jrs> should ATI Sapphire X1600 pro work on any Ubuntu distro's?
[08:36] <ivx> jeffbell gimp doesn't cut it for you?
[08:36] <JeffBell> ivx, not even close.  I already prefer krita to gimp.  Gimp is not sufficient for professional work.  Neither is krita, for that matter, but its an application I'll watch more closely.
[08:37] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: what do you primarily do with Photoshop, crop/color balance retouching or effects?
[08:37] <ivx> jeffbell yeah I don't do that crazy of stuff to notice, some people say it is 1:1
[08:38] <ashika> JeffBell, According to linuxforums and WineDB it works.
[08:38] <manmadha> mamzers555, what are the extra packages...?I mean gaim-encryption_3.0+beta7-1_i386..
[08:38] <JeffBell> Kingsqueak, I use Photoshop on a daily basis to manage workflows on a variety of projects from print to web.
[08:38] <manmadha> what is this..?
[08:38] <davin> #ubuntu-offtopic ftw
[08:38] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: check www.bibblelabs.com it's great for what it does
[08:39] <manmadha> mamzers555, i have to install all the packages in this///
[08:39] <manmadha> ?
[08:39] <JeffBell> ivx, krita seems to have a better platform for "moving forward" versus gimp development seems really hampered by hardheadness.  my opinion only.  ymmv.
[08:39] <JeffBell> ashika, I was just reading that and will give it the old college try =] 
[08:39] <mamzers555> manmadha; http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1761200#post1761200 you can check if this works for you, it is 2.0beta5 + some oher useful stuff like encryption and notification
[08:40] <ashika> JeffBell, If you want to be professional then you can buy CrossWeaver or *cough*torrent/warez*cough* and use it as it runs photoshop cs2 100%
[08:40] <mamzers555> manmadha; you dont have to install all
[08:40] <JeffBell> kingsqueak, I am familiar with Bibble for RAW work.  To be sure.  And I do work with RAW images as well, so Bibble may be an answer.  However, I should mention that I do not use Photoshop for RAW images as the DNG format is lame as all get out.  Nossir, i stick with Capture NX for the time being.
[08:40] <VigoFusion> I have to go to work! YAY I got a job
[08:40] <manmadha> mamzers555, ohh thank u dude
[08:40] <sgirc> i need help please
[08:40] <JeffBell> ashika, I'll check out this CrossWeaver business....
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: yeah that's why I asked what you did with Photoshop
[08:40] <SiDi> where can i find a ubuntu install for floppys
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> bibble runs nicely on linux
[08:40] <ashika> JeffBell, So JeffBell are you really asking a question or just having fun? You seem like the kind of person who already knows the answer.
[08:41] <sgirc> how can I know what is module 2684 ?
[08:41] <mamzers555> manmadha; maybe you can try it, i cannot guaranty that it works
[08:41] <JeffBell> Kingsqueak, I appreciate your pointing me in the right direction.  I think Windows emulation is my best position for much of my graphic manipulation needs, at this time.
[08:41] <mamzers555> manmadha; but maybe you can tell me
[08:41] <JeffBell> However, I do like Inkscape as a replacement for Illustrator or, in my case, FreeHand.
[08:41] <manmadha> mamzers555, hee....my gaim is not working
[08:41] <mamzers555> manmadha; if it don't work, i'll remove the package
[08:41] <ivx> jeffbell, is krita gpl also?
[08:41] <JeffBell> I have learned to adapt to Inkscape and find it is worthwhile in a production environment.
=== PriceChild is now known as PriceChild_away
[08:41] <JeffBell> ivx, yes it is
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: if you are doing this for commerical work...I would say vmware is the way to run Windows
[08:41] <manmadha> mamzers555, it is not workig
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: wine may run some things, but it has its quirks
[08:42] <amrnet> what is the program name that help me download pics from my digcam
[08:42] <JeffBell> ashika, I started off joke about windows media... but I'm now serious =] 
[08:42] <mamzers555> manmadha; can you start it in console what does it say?
[08:42] <ivx> jeffbell but you think krita is better than gimp?
[08:42] <ashika> JeffBell, I see. It seems lile youre just having fun to me ;)
[08:42] <manmadha> mamzers555, okk 1m
[08:42] <JeffBell> Kingsqueak, thanks for the headsup on VMWare vs. WINE.  I will try both, but if WMWare is the way to go... then I've no problem using it.
[08:42] <rioghal> amrnet, gthumb can do that and i think f-spot can too
[08:42] <JeffBell> ashika, only at the beginning... once you mentioned WINE, you had me tame as a small rabbit
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: there's also the 'commercial' WINE by codeweavers.com
[08:43] <amrnet> thanks
[08:43] <regeya> whee.
[08:43] <manmadha> mamzers555, this is the out put.....gaim: error while loading shared libraries: libdbus-1.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[08:43] <ashika> kingrayray, I already said that.
[08:43] <JeffBell> ivx, demonstrably better.  krita is a koffice piece; the only bad thing I can say about it.
[08:43] <JeffBell> ivx, from what I gather, krita's future direction looks outstanding whereas the gimp wallows in madness.
[08:43] <ivx> jeffbell what is koffice
[08:44] <rioghal> amrnet, or if youre using a sd card you can buy a cheap sd card reader (mine cost $4.00) and it will mount as a mass storage device when you put the sd card into the reader
[08:44] <mboso> anyone in here using FF2 and Flash 9?
[08:44] <sethk> JeffBell, that's too bad, gimp has possibilities.
[08:44] <sethk> ivx, the KDE people have an office suite
[08:44] <ashika> JeffBell, I've always viewed GIMP as the
[08:44] <JeffBell> ivx, a KDE office suite (does not come with Ubuntu, as I've learned, because U uses gnome instead kde... details, details)
[08:44] <sethk> ivx, called koffice, has word processor, spread sheet, etc.
[08:44] <mamzers555> manmadha; no problem, just one min
[08:44] <ashika> JeffBell, 'freebie' which is for people who dont want to buy Photoshop or get it illegaly.
[08:44] <manmadha> mamzers555, okk
[08:44] <Kingsqueak> JeffBell: heh you can just install KDE and apps if you want
[08:44] <sethk> JeffBell, it "comes with" ubuntu just as much as any other office apps.  You install it with synaptic, just as you do with the others
[08:44] <JeffBell> sethk, I think GIMP had good intentions and is a decent "basic" editing platform, but claims about being able to use it in most professional environments are *greatly* exaggerated.
[08:44] <ivx> thanks guys
[08:45] <amrnet> rioghal: i am trying to connect to my digicam but it does not appear under media or computer i think i need to be in a groop or am missing a program
[08:45] <Kingsqueak> the main issue with Gimp and true pre-press work is the limited color space
[08:45] <sethk> JeffBell, well, I wouldn't even guess at what "most" would mean in that type of claim.
[08:45] <JeffBell> ashika, I think that's a good summary of GIMP.  it works well for basic photo edits or maybe some original web graphics.
[08:45] <rioghal> amrnet, do you have gthumb installed
[08:45] <amrnet> yap
[08:45] <amrnet> installing fspot right now too
[08:45] <JeffBell> sethk, when you've been working in advertising and design shops for well over a decade, one tends to gloss over generalizations as being accepted as true
[08:46] <rioghal> amrnet, open it and go to File -> Import Photos and see if it reconizes your digcam
[08:46] <ashzilla> Hi friends.
[08:46] <JeffBell> sethk, I guess that makes me as snobby as some linux can be... fortunately, not all are.  and perhaps I should write up a little paper on how GIMP fails in that regard.  It could be interesting.
[08:46] <sethk> JeffBell, are you saying you prefer krita for working with photos?
[08:46] <JeffBell> Although I think some /. posts may have covered bits and pieces of that from time to time.
[08:46] <JeffBell> sethk, so forgive me... that's what I'm saying
[08:47] <sethk> JeffBell, nothing to forgive, I'm just asking the question
[08:47] <amrnet> rioghal: it could not detect my cam strange for i used to use it before
[08:47] <JeffBell> sethk, #1 I much prefer the interface of krita
[08:47] <bretzel> Hi how to remove vmware, I am stuck in configure-failure - remove-failure cycle!!! and then how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta )
[08:47] <JeffBell> sethk, #2 I much prefer the outlook of the developers
[08:47] <amrnet> rioghal: it is not mounted either
[08:47] <mamzers555> manmadha; just enter in the terminal 'sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-3' to install libdbus
[08:47] <rioghal> amrnet, click on the no camera detected button and see if your cam is in that list
[08:47] <sgirc> its really deseperating 935 connected andno one able to reply ...
[08:47] <ashzilla> I'm looking for the proper code to display files in a given directory in order of ascending numerical values. I.e 1,2,3...10,11,12,...100,101.102
[08:47] <sethk> JeffBell, I'd agree on point #2.  Point #1 I'll have to work more with krita before I comment.
[08:47] <ashzilla> I'm looking for the proper code to display files in a given directory in order of ascending numerical values. I.e 1,2,3...10,11,12,...100,101.102 using GNU ls
[08:48] <manmadha> mamzers555, there is no such pacage.....:(
[08:48] <bretzel> Hi how to remove vmware, I am stuck in configure-failure - remove-failure cycle!!! and then how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta )
[08:48] <JeffBell> sethk, I'm in a wait-n-watch mode as neither software allows me to do what I need/want/like/must.
[08:48] <JeffBell> sethk, GIMP is mired down in backwards thinking.... and I have poked around  it quite a bit
[08:49] <sethk> JeffBell, I'd be interested to see that writeup you were just talking about.  I only do photo editing
[08:49] <sioux> hi doy know if there is a irc channel for linux running on dell pc?
[08:49] <bretzel> Hi how to remove vmware, I am stuck in configure-failure - remove-failure cycle!!! and then how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta )
[08:49] <mamzers555> manmadha; which ubuntu-version do you have?
[08:49] <rioghal> JeffBell, have you seen these  http://www.gimptalk.com/  http://gug.sunsite.dk/
[08:49] <manmadha> 6.06
[08:49] <amrnet> it is on list but gthumb can not connect to it
[08:49] <bretzel> vmware-player-kernel-modules-2.6.17-10 unremoveable
[08:49] <JeffBell> sethk, I am new to krita.. very recent, in fact... already my productivity is much higher due to a much better interface (and I'm not just referring to palettes that dont disappear like GIMP) and I very much like ggood portions of where the community wants to take krita.... and thus, from what I gather, has built the platform to accommodate in the future
[08:49] <rioghal> amrnet, it would need to be mounted in order for gthumb to connect to it
[08:50] <manmadha> mamzers555, 6.06 version
[08:50] <JeffBell> sethk, I am not a C programmer or anything, so I rely on interpretations when it comes to assessing platforms.  that said, I'm not a total idiot, either
[08:50] <amrnet> yah i know and i do not know why it is not mounted
[08:50] <ashika> JeffBell, in my opinion you have your mind made and either stick to Krita or use Wine/Crossover.
[08:50] <bretzel> how to remove vmware, I am stuck in configure-failure - remove-failure cycle!!! and then how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta )
[08:50] <amrnet> is there a special kernel module i have to check
[08:50] <Fred_Sambo> bretzel, that sucks!
[08:50] <Fred_Sambo> vmware has changed my life
[08:50] <spunk_> soren, hello. :-)
[08:50] <rioghal> amrnet, not sure i have not had a device fail to mount when i plugged it in
[08:51] <manmadha> mamzers555, ok i am downloading it
[08:51] <JeffBell> ashika, what I am happy to learn today.... having made up my mind, previously, to stick with Windows as my primary boot.... is that I *can* find a way to use Photoshop inside of Ubuntu.  That surprises and pleases me to no end!
[08:51] <bretzel> how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta ) then ?
[08:51] <zlack> anybody else running skype and encountering random crashes of the program?
[08:51] <mamzers555> manmadha; sorry mate, this package is for 6.10
[08:51] <amrnet> rioghal: first time i have this prob too ok will try something and be back :)
[08:51] <ashika> JeffBell, Use wine it has been reported by some that CS2 works.
[08:51] <mamzers555> manmadha; i don't know if it works for you
[08:51] <JeffBell> rioghal, I will check those momentarily.  thank oyu
[08:51] <manmadha> ya it is not working for me
[08:51] <allz> ljl plzzz pm me .when you will comeback
[08:51] <JeffBell> *you
[08:51] <bretzel> how to get kernel headers for compiling kernel modules ? ( nvidia beta )
[08:51] <mamzers555> manmadha; it is better to compile from source in this case, i can help you with the ./configure-stuff
[08:51] <dm_> hey guys ne f my keys stpped wrking can anyne help
[08:51] <manmadha> how to install it?
[08:52] <manmadha> ohhh
[08:52] <rioghal> JeffBell, i had my doubts about gimp until i found those two sites  those sites have helped me do tons of stuff in the gimp
[08:52] <manmadha> But it is not working
[08:52] <samu> Do I need to install any special packages to get the full effect from my "powerful" voodoo3 3dfx card in games for example?
[08:52] <mamzers555> manmadha; because it is for 6.10
[08:52] <spunk_> Hi! I'm trying to install Edgy on an Acer Laptop. The comp. has a Intel Wifi card (Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG). I'm having a hard time to get it running... Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
[08:52] <ashika> spunk_, Download linux version of drivers.
[08:52] <manmadha> mamzers555, it is asking for gtk2.0
[08:53] <manmadha> mamzers555, You must have the GTK+ 2.0 development headers installed to compile Gaim's
[08:53] <manmadha> GTK+ interface.  If you only want to build the console interface then
[08:53] <manmadha> specify --disable-gtkui when running configure.
[08:53] <JeffBell> rioghal, I will go through them, but I am highly skeptical.  There is no doubt that the GIMP has many powerful tools.  But I balk at the prospect of serious work. =] 
[08:53] <mamzers555> manmadha; yes
[08:53] <spunk_> ashika: ok, from the sourceforge project?
[08:53] <manmadha> This is the out put
[08:53] <dm_> the letter after n and the letter befre p stpped wrkin n my keybard, can anyne help
[08:53] <dm_> this is strange
[08:53] <manmadha> what to do..?
[08:53] <ashika> spunk_, Wherever you find them for your card. As soon as you install your card's drivers it should work after a reboot.
[08:53] <spunk_> ashika: ok, I've tried to find them in Synaptic but to no avail... :-(
[08:54] <mamzers555> manmadha; just a moment
[08:54] <ashika> spunk_, Inte;
[08:54] <ashika> spunk_, Intel's website or do a google search with wireless card name and driver download after.
[08:54] <spunk_> ashika, ok, Ill try that. thanks!
[08:54] <xenex> how would one convert all of the icons in /usr/share/icons/ to jpg or ico? i tried uploading them to a ftp and then downloading them on windows but only some actually show the picture
[08:55] <mamzers555> manmadha; you have to install the gtk2-libs to compile gaim
[08:55] <Cosmonaut3030> Does anyone know how to make Konsole display colours?
[08:55] <ashzilla> I'm looking for the proper code to display files in a given directory in order of ascending numerical values. I.e 1,2,3...10,11,12,...100,101.102 using GNU ls
[08:55] <sethk> Cosmonaut3030, it has various color arrangements available in it's configuration menus
[08:56] <JeffBell> For those with patience, there is an interesting discussion on *some* aspects of how GIMP fails versus Photoshop (some are detailed, some are not) but this is a good starting point.  http://thelinuxadvocate.blogspot.com/2006/08/gimp-vs-photoshop-what-still-needs-to.html
[08:56] <Scorpmoon> my computer stalls, i can't do anything but use the reset button.. is this more likely to be a hardware fault than ubuntu error?
[08:57] <blithe> I've always wondered if there were things the gimp did well that photoshop did not.
[08:57] <dfgas> any apache pros in here?
[08:57] <JeffBell> blithe, I have not encountered a single one.
[08:57] <dfgas> anyidea why i installed apache and php5 in ubuntu and when i try to goto the site it just trys to download all the files that i am trying to access
[08:57] <xenex> how would one convert all of the icons in /usr/share/icons/ to jpg or ico? i tried uploading them to a ftp and then downloading them on windows but only some actually show the picture
[08:57] <roryy> ashzilla: ls|sort -n might work
[08:57] <roryy> ashzilla: not sure about floating-point type numbers
[08:57] <blithe> JeffBell: Then again, I'm a pro in either of them to the slightest, and never utilize advanced features.
[08:57] <Cosmonaut3030> sethk, I'm not talking about the colour scheme, I mean like highlighted at signs.... if that makes any sense.
[08:58] <ashzilla> roryy, I was looking at that but couldn't figure it out. I'll give it a go.
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[08:58] <manmadha> mamzers555, there is no such pacakge dude
=== joerg_ is now known as caplink811
=== Prog is now known as Proger
[08:58] <sethk> Cosmonaut3030, the ncurses library has those capabilities, and they work with konsole
[08:58] <livingdaylight> anyone use Gizmo?
[08:58] <spunk_> ashika, still there?
[08:58] <Cosmonaut3030> The ncurses library? Anything important I should know before I set off on my search?
[08:58] <ashzilla> roryy: worked perfectly. :] 
[08:59] <ashzilla> Thanks
[08:59] <Alan_> what would cause modprobe to loose track of the modules?
[08:59] <livingdaylight> can i safely use the Debian .deb Gizmo file or should i install the binary .tar.gz instead?
[08:59] <mamzers555> manmadha; 'sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev'
[08:59] <roryy> livingdaylight: probably best to use the .tar.gz
[08:59] <JeffBell> blithe, I think for basic image manipulation (cropping, rotating, resizing, maybe a few basic filters... as someone else mentioned previously) then the GIMP is sufficient.  krita has a much friendly UI, but those who have used GIMP for 3+ years might shrug it off.
[08:59] <`4aFkA`> will anyone give me a link from vmware pls!! ?
[08:59] <rioghal> livingdaylight, one should not use debian .deb's at all in ubuntu.. its better to compile it yourself
[09:00] <roryy> livingdaylight: if you're feeling up to it, you could try to build from the debian source
[09:00] <e_machinist> When I set my desktop resolution to 1024x768, the fonts, buttons, etc, seem really huge and take up far too much space (as compared to other OS's running at the same resolution). Is there any way to make GNOME look "normal" at 1024x768?
[09:00] <LjL> allz: "apt-cache policy nvidia-glx". look if the "candidate" and "installed" versions match, and what they are.
[09:00] <e_machinist> I don't feel like I'm describing the situation very well.
[09:00] <`4aFkA`> will anyone give me a link from vmware pls!! ?
[09:01] <rioghal> e_machinist, have you tried 1152x864  it will give you more desktop space but will make things just a tad smaller

[09:03] <`4aFkA`> will anyone give me a link from vmware pls!! ? i need to instal ubuntu
[09:04] <alextb> ola...
[09:04] <rioghal> livingdaylight, the advice i got was 1) install from repos, 2) find an ubuntu .deb, 3) compile it yourself
[09:04] <alextb> como sai de um canal?
[09:04] <JeffBell> Thanks for the help, y'all.  You made my night fun. =]  I've bookmarked the links. But it's just after then and the missus will demand I step away from the screen soonish.  Until next time...

[09:05] <`4aFkA`> will the programs who are on my windows work on linux ?
[09:05] <icepack> '4aFkA': you need to download a free trial for the workstation to install the virtual machine

[09:05] <rioghal> xSUSHi, open a term and type: who
[09:05] <Kingsqueak> xSUSHi: 'w'
[09:05] <icepack> '4aFkA'- elaborate
[09:05] <Cosmonaut3030> ashzilla: what's the file ending?
[09:05] <xSUSHi> Thanks, and what's the command to find out what ports are open?

[09:06] <biotech> hey everyody :) i need help with a small project. im looking for an 2d mmorpg server, tiled based like fifnal fantasy.
[09:06] <xSUSHi> Kingsqueak and rioghal thanks a lot
[09:06] <`4aFkA`> the programs who work in windows can some how be made to work on ubuntu ?
[09:06] <rioghal> xSUSHi, np :)
[09:06] <biotech> 4afka use wine
[09:06] <probins> sorry I had to go do something else
[09:06] <allz> ljl
[09:06] <allz> here?
[09:06] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell `4aFkA` about wine
[09:06] <icepack> '4aFkA': check out www.winehq.com for that, vmware will let you actually run windows in linux. much different from wine
[09:06] <LjL> allz: try restarting X first, yeah, but i'm guessing you'll have to reboot the computer, since kernel modules have been updated
[09:07] <allz> i try that
[09:07] <probins> did you answer me to my snd_usb_audio question?
[09:07] <probins> I get "/lib/modules/2.6.15-26-386/kernel/sound/usb/snd-usb-audio.ko
[09:07] <xenex> how would one convert all of the icons in /usr/share/icons/ to jpg or ico? i tried uploading them to a ftp and then downloading them on windows but only some actually show the picture
[09:07] <LjL> allz, yeah, wrong paste
[09:07] <pcgigabyte> Question. I tried the installing of xgl guide but it is outdated. Anyone know of a new updated install of xgl guide that works?

[09:07] <`4aFkA`> tnx biotech
[09:07] <biotech> there is one mmorpg server for windows called x-realms
[09:07] <jrs> hy, i tried to burn the xubuntu iso but my cd-rom-burner only burns a little piece of the iso :s how can i fix this?
[09:07] <biotech> np
[09:08] <Alan_> My system stopped autoloading the modules on boot. Modprobe can't find the modules unless I give it the full path name. I'm not sure what I changed (besides installing kde)
[09:08] <ashzilla> Okay, to start Songbird I use ./Songbird, is it possible to run this command so the terminal window will close after it starts the application?
[09:08] <`4aFkA`> icepack whitch one i need to download ??
[09:08] <ashzilla> Or better yet, is it possible to run a terminal command, so that after the application starts the terminal window (or tab) closes?
[09:09] <roryy> ashzilla: something like './Songbird& exit' ?
[09:09] <mcphail> ashzilla: why not start it from an alt-f2 launcher?
[09:09] <mc__> ashzilla: it is
[09:09] <icepack> '4aFka': depends on what you want to do. wine will run some windows programs, theres a list of apps at www.winehq.com. for vmware, you'll have to actually install windows(you need a working cd-key), it won't ad or touch partitions.
[09:09] <mc__> ashzilla: "exec yourcommand"
[09:09] <xSUSHi> xenex have you tried imagemagick
[09:09] <biotech> if this is not the room to ask about an mmorpg server for ubuntu "linux" could some one tell me where i need to go?
[09:09] <rioghal> Ash-Fox, you might try running it with the command: /path/Songbird & && exit
[09:09] <osfameron> fantastic, the bug report tool for firefox is buggy
[09:09] <xSUSHi> biotech: there are several
[09:09] <osfameron> I'm supposed to attach a file.  Manually.  To something or other.
[09:09] <rioghal> osfameron, lol
[09:10] <xenex> xSUSHi: where can i get that?
[09:10] <ashzilla> roryy: that worked perfectly. Thanks :] 
[09:10] <xSUSHi> xenex; to be successful in linux you must google.      but to save you a click, go to http://www.imagemagick.org
[09:10] <biotech> xSUSHi, i googled for a bunch with no results, could you give me some ideals?
[09:10] <ashzilla> mc__: that is also an option that satisifies what I was looking for, thanks.
[09:10] <jrs> hy, i tried to burn the xubuntu iso but my cd-rom-burner only burns a little piece of the iso :s how can i fix this?

[09:11] <icepack> '4aFkA'- are you installing vmware in linux or windows?

[09:13] <allz> :S
[09:13] <biotech> no, does it require a lot of resources? i got a cheap pc.
[09:13] <icepack> '4aFka'- then all you need is an ubuntu disk. you start vmware workstation, create a new machine under linux-ubuntu. then put the ubuntu cd in, and start up the machine. it'll run ubuntu in a window after you install ubuntu

[09:16] <nandhp> I recently upgraded to edgy. It failed on irda-utils, then froze before I could get around to fixing it (a different problem), so I had to run dpkg --configure -a manually after starting back up. This seems to have worked, except that when I start up, I get a 5minute delay between "ts: Compaq touchscreen protocol output" in the module loading and "Loading manual drivers". Is this a known problem?

[09:27] <fbc> lifepositive:  Not everyone lives or has lived in australia. The word "coco" to a haitian person would be offensive. But my guess is unless ABO is from australia, they are probably his initials.

[09:27] <lifepositive> abo: im not ;)

[09:29] <abo> fbc, lifepositive - I'll remember that when I visit Australia, I'm not from Australia, these are not my initials, I guess  we will be kicked out if we don't stop spamming the channels with  irrelevant content ;-)
[09:29] <anirban> can I add the dvd as a repository source
[09:29] <jokoon> Is there some way to display the workspace's title and the windows little squares too in it ?
[09:29] <dfgas> php5 still won't work

[09:30] <fbc> abo: :-)
[09:30] <Zaggynl> lifepositive, in terminal: 'tor --help' should do ;)
[09:30] <nanaki> how can I get samba to work my network correctly towards my winblows PC
[09:30] <jokoon> How create my own keyboard layout, somebody told me about some dir in usr or something ...
[09:30] <xSUSHi> lifepositive tor --version    maybe?
[09:30] <SilentDis> hello :)
[09:30] <Alter-Ego> jean, those links tell you how
[09:30] <Zaggynl> also works
[09:30] <snoogie> hello to everyone
[09:30] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows if there is a linux version/alternative of/for 'Bit che' or 'Torrent Harvester' ? (And yes I tried googlin' :P)
[09:30] <dubiboy> anyone know how to disable Gnome shortcut alt-right_button ?
[09:30] <jean> Ok Tks friends...!!!!
[09:30] <Bobby_Easland> nanaki-> sudo apt-get install sambafs
[09:30] <lifepositive> xSUSHi: ill try
[09:30] <kikokos> hi
[09:31] <nanaki> did not work it says not avaible package
[09:31] <kikokos> how to encode cdaudio to mp3?
[09:31] <Bobby_Easland> then enable your universe repository
[09:31] <SilentDis> quick question:  I'm running ubuntu, but would like to have the kde environment available to me.  can Gnome and KDE be run in 'paralell', what package do I need to select, and how do you 'switch' between the 2?
[09:31] <xSUSHi> dubiboy: System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
[09:31] <kikokos> my sound-juicer make a core dumped so something else please
[09:31] <hilde> for what stands subnet in the line ? subnet 192.168.123.254 netmask 255.255.255.0
[09:31] <probins> silentdis
[09:31] <hilde> should it be 192.168.123.1 or 254
[09:31] <probins> yeah I just did sudo apt-get install kde
[09:31] <probins> from gnome
[09:31] <probins> then logoff
[09:31] <djsroknrol> hello everyone
[09:31] <probins> click options in the corner
[09:32] <probins> and you can use kde
[09:32] <nandhp> It should probably be kubuntu-desktop, though
[09:32] <rioghal> SilentDis, gnome apps can easily run in kde and vice versa  youll need to install  kubuntu-desktop to get kde and youll have to log out and back in (choosing the desktop you want to use) in order to use the one you want
[09:32] <dubiboy> xSUSHI: I tried that but it that combination is not there
[09:32] <kikokos> my sound-juicer make a core dumped so something else please for make mp3 from audiocd
[09:32] <nandhp> and your display manager/login screen should let you choose which session.
[09:32] <kikokos> or make mpc from audiocd
[09:32] <SilentDis> rioghal:  thanks!  off to work with me, and the 'puter has some downloading to do :)
[09:33] <fbc> lifepositive: I found something that will do it.. http://sourceforge.net/projects/gotmail/
[09:33] <fulhack> Hello. Any ideas on if I can make the gnome desktop not display icons?
[09:33] <rioghal> Silivrenion, :)
[09:33] <probins> ive spent a week trying to get snd_usb_audio to work too enable my usb midi device
[09:33] <nanaki> Can anyone help me to get samba running good under gnome and not terminal. I have problems with "can't locate xxx since it is not a folder"
[09:33] <dubiboy> fulhack: which icons?
[09:34] <kikokos> has anybody idea for convert cdaudio to mp3 without ripping just encode?
[09:34] <fulhack> dubiboy: The desktop icons, directories and such
[09:34] <Jowi> hilde, subnet 192.168.123.254 is the "network" where 192.168.123.x is the individual computers. 192.168.123.1 is normally a router and 254 is the broadcast address.
[09:35] <probins> nanaki - samba to connect to a windows pc - I just click "places" at the top and navigate to the netwok pc
[09:35] <hilde> thx Jowi
[09:35] <nandhp> fulhack: You can hide the computer icon and home icon and stuff by opening gconf-editor and opening /apps/nautilus/desktop
[09:35] <Kingsqueak> kikokos: you have to do both, have to rip it, in order to encode it
[09:35] <dubiboy> fulhack: gconf-editor then apps->nautilus->desktop
[09:35] <lifepositive> fbc: thats amazing
[09:35] <nanaki> Probins, where can I find the "places" thing?
[09:35] <probins> you running ubuntu?
[09:35] <fulhack> ah, thanks guys
[09:35] <Kingsqueak> kikokos: use yaret, grip, etc. they'll do it in once process but it's still two things underneat
[09:36] <kikokos> Kingsqueak: yes but it take me one hour
[09:36] <probins> on my gnome system it is at the top between apps and system
[09:36] <lifepositive> kikokos: what does?
[09:36] <dubiboy> xSHUSHI: any ideas - since I have already spent over an hour trying to disable alt rightclick
[09:36] <Kingsqueak> kikokos: just a slow drive or machine...not much you can do about that
[09:36] <lifepositive> kikokos: what else you got to do with the hour? LOL
[09:37] <lifepositive> kikokos: its not like you dont have any free time LOL
[09:37] <kikokos> Kingsqueak: :)
[09:37] <fbc> lifepositive:  Well, Thank you.  My wife said the same thing last night. :-p
[09:37] <LadyNikon> O.O
[09:37] <jrs> xSUSHi, hmm when i try to burn iso to disk it says that the cdrom drive is unmounted or something.. it doesnt burn at all :s
[09:37] <lifepositive> fbc: :lol :)
[09:38] <lifepositive> fbc: too bad she was talking about how small it was
[09:38] <fulhack> That worked out great, Never used that settings editor before. Nice stuff. While I'm at it, can I make gnome switch desktops when I drag a window to the desktop's end?
[09:38] <fbc> lifepositive:  ouch
[09:38] <spudgunner> Network Manager is acting funny for me: nm-applet simply fails to see my wireless card, but everything else can see it just fine, is there a .conf file for nm-applet?
[09:38] <lifepositive> fbc: is it true that your wife calls you pee-wee sometimes?
[09:38] <kikokos> lifepositive: my life seems to be slowly :P but I really want fast program to make mp3/,pc from audiocd do u know some?
[09:39] <Jowi> jrs, try to get the full error. the cd writer should not be mounted while burning a iso.
[09:39] <cmweb-admin> Is any one good with printers such as Lexmark. I got mine installed but when i go to print it succedes and then stops ubruptly
[09:39] <lifepositive> kikokos: get a faster system then :)
[09:39] <nanaki> I need help to get my Samba back working. I can't browser to my windows PC over Network servers
[09:39] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: other wifi apps interfere with it, you need to stop the other ones and clean up /etc/network/interfaces so that only the 'lo' interface is there
[09:39] <cmweb-admin> Though it does not start
[09:39] <lifepositive> fbc: did you get it working?
[09:39] <dabaR> nanaki: and the network servers run ubuntu w/ samba?
[09:40] <nanaki> Yes with Samba
[09:40] <kikokos> lifepositive: :)
[09:40] <nanaki> Dabar: yes
[09:40] <tomer> i need help
[09:40] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: only lo?? wouldn't i want to list my cards? or is gnome going to do it automagically
[09:40] <lifepositive> kikokos: you cant get blood out of a stone :)
[09:40] <tomer> i need help
[09:40] <jrs> Jowi, i get this error
[09:40] <nanaki> dabar: I upgraded to edgy and since then it doesn't work anymore.
[09:40] <jrs> Error mounting /media/cdrom0.
[09:40] <jrs> umount: /media/cdrom0 is not connected or something
[09:40] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: nm likes to sort of take over, it will manage wired and wireless on your same system for you
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: just comment out the existing entries , don't remove them
[09:41] <pianoboy3333> What can I do with composite enabled metacity?
[09:41] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: that way if you have trouble you can undo that
[09:41] <lifepositive> fbc: did you get it working yet?
[09:41] <dabaR> nanaki: OK. What did you upgrade to edgy? the samba computer? How many computers are there in total?
[09:41] <Jowi> jrs, and what are you trying to do? mounting a cd or burning it?
[09:41] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: thats what i did... now to reload the applet...
[09:42] <jrs> i'm trying to burn xubuntu iso to a cd through Ubuntu, but it doesn't work properly Jowi
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: yeah be sure wifi-radar if you installed it is not running
[09:42] <fbc> lifepositive:  working on it now
[09:42] <Jowi> jrs, do you get that error before, during or after the burn?
[09:42] <nanaki> dabar: I only use the laptop and it is my own network. I use it to move some files from laptop to be and back. and I upgraded fully to edgy.
[09:42] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: what happens is the other utils take over the interface so another app can't configure it
[09:42] <cmweb-admin> Did any one recieve my last transmition?
[09:42] <lifepositive> fbc: im ignorant of perl scripts!  can you teach me to get it working once you worked it out?  please?
[09:42] <dubiboy> Does anyone know how to disable the alt-rightclick shortcut. I have tried System/Preferences/KeyBoardShortcuts but it is not listed there.
[09:43] <jrs> jowi i get it before
[09:43] <Le_Murphant> Hello, i'm new to linux, comming from windows, and I can't figure out how to open bin files
[09:43] <Le_Murphant> could someone help me out plz?
[09:43] <dabaR> nanaki: you have a laptop, that you are trying to use on a network you were able to use it before, and the only thing that changed is you upgrading the laptop to edgy?
[09:43] <Kingsqueak> Le_Murphant: you don't really, they are compiled binaries, you just run them
[09:43] <nandhp> dubiboy: Preferences->Windows, try changing Alt to something else
[09:43] <nanaki> dabar: Yes that is right.
[09:43] <lifepositive> fbc: would that be ok?
[09:43] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: i'm not running any wireless apps other than NetworkManager and nm-applet
[09:43] <jrs> Jowi,  i'm getting the error befor it starts to burn
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> Le_Murphant: if you mean run them, just type the name and hit <return> or  ./<name of the application>
[09:44] <Jowi> jrs, so it is ok. to burn an iso: insert the empty cdr/cdrw (do not mount it) and then burn it. you will get an error if you try to mount it because the cd is empty.
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: should be good then
[09:44] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: reloading the applet doesn't help, when is the config file checked?
[09:44] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, do you know aanything about Lexmark Printers?
[09:44] <grimboy> If my processor is a Celeron M then should I get the 686 kernel?
[09:44] <dabaR> nanaki: so how do you access the share?
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: you may need a reboot, the underlying daemon is network-manager maybe that needs a restart, then nm-applet
[09:44] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: they work?
[09:45] <Le_Murphant> I downloaded Realplayer, and it came as a .bin file on my desktop, clicking it doesn't do anything
[09:45] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: I use a ton of them via cups on the job
[09:45] <LjL> Le_Murphant, you can get realplayer packaged, no need to download a .bin
[09:45] <lifepositive> LjL: hello
[09:45] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, i got mine installed and everything it wont print though, i goes to a job then the job stops
[09:45] <CientificoLoco> how do I expand the memory of my aMSN for to add emoticons, 'coz the fisrt I added it was erasing...
[09:45] <nanaki> sabar: I always used Places-Network Servers and then browsed to it, but instead folder icons I get just a paper icon
[09:45] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueak, then wont pront
[09:45] <Le_Murphant> How do I do that Lifepositive?
[09:45] <cmweb-admin> print*
[09:45] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: when you run gnome-cups-admin it sees the printer and says it's ready?
[09:45] <Le_Murphant> Eer, I mean LjL
[09:46] <cmweb-admin> yes
[09:46] <xamox> What torrent software does everyone recommend? I want it to run as a service where I could maybe connect to it via webbrowser and add torrents. Is this possible?
[09:46] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: can it print a test page?
[09:46] <LjL> Le_Murphant: i think it's in dapper-commercial
[09:46] <jerp> I've got a mount error "mount: /dev/ is not a block device
[09:46] <cmweb-admin> il try it
[09:46] <jrs> Jowi,  i'm not mounting the cd :( it just gives me an error, i'll show u a screenshot
[09:46] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: got it, the config file did it.  I just had to killall NetworkManager to force a reload
[09:46] <Kingsqueak> spudgunner: there you go, nm is pretty nice
[09:46] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak:  thanks!
[09:46] <spudgunner> Kingsqueak: oh i know, i missed it when it stopped working : P
[09:46] <dubiboy> nandhp: Nothing there about remapping or removing this combination?
[09:46] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueak, it says printing then it goes to the interface then says Stoped: Job Stoped
[09:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: does your printer show any errors?
[09:47] <cmweb-admin> where
[09:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: lights look normal, not flashing, no jams, ink is good etc
[09:47] <cmweb-admin> on it self
[09:47] <Kingsqueak> yeah
[09:47] <fulhack> Any clues on if I can activate dragging and dropping windows between different desktops in gnome? Like I can in beryl and emerald?
[09:47] <cmweb-admin> All it says is the line is in use and thats because im online
[09:47] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: this an attached printer or network?
[09:48] <LjL> Le_Murphant: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RealplayerInstallationMethods
[09:48] <jrs> Jowi, never mind, now it looks like it's running properly... think it was a bug...
[09:48] <cmweb-admin> its an x125 no its local
[09:48] <Le_Murphant> LjL: Ty
[09:48] <Jowi> jrs, ok. glad it sorted itself out
[09:48] <dabaR> nanaki: you never had to configure anything to get that working?
[09:48] <CientificoLoco> LjL, what messenger do you use?
[09:48] <jrs> yeah
[09:48] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: I would delete it in gnome-cups-manager and configure it again
[09:48] <jrs> thanks for the support Jowi
[09:48] <cmweb-admin> ok
[09:48] <LjL> CientificoLoco: uh?
[09:48] <LjL> lifepositive hi
[09:48] <CientificoLoco> LjL, ah, like MSN...
[09:48] <nanaki> dabar: never had to configure anything. Always found the network
[09:49] <LjL> CientificoLoco: ah - none of them
[09:49] <jrs> btw
[09:49] <dabaR> nanaki: how about if you use places connect to server, can you connect that way?
[09:49] <lifepositive> Le_Murphant: do what?
[09:49] <jrs> is xubuntu 6.10 stable??
[09:49] <Kingsqueak> jrs: should be, yes
[09:49] <nanaki> dabar: how do I do that. I tried it but it confuses me
[09:49] <superkirbyartist> Yes it works pretty well.
[09:49] <xamox> anyone know why I can mount a harddrive but when I put it in my fstab it keeps complaining it has errors and tries to run e2fsck on it?
[09:49] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueak. Ok i got it re-installed but still the same
[09:49] <ivx> hello, when i open the printers it lists one, but it won't let me remove it, and it says one job and ready, but does not show any jobs. also in my panel it has a printer icon, i stopped cups and restarted but it just pops back up
[09:50] <CientificoLoco> LjL, shy...
[09:50] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: not sure, try linuxprinting.org maybe for any model specific issues
[09:50] <keelbill> hello
[09:50] <grimboy> keelbill, Lo
[09:50] <dabaR> nanaki: choose windows share, enter server name(the netbios name, or IP address) then try connecting.
[09:50] <keelbill> please help me if any of you can
[09:50] <superkirbyartist> If you want to vote for Ebuntu name: http://ebuntu.sos-sts.com/poll/
[09:50] <superkirbyartist> It takes 10 seconds at the most.
[09:50] <keelbill> hi grimboy
[09:51] <landexem> I have a Dell laptop with a Intel Wireless PRO 3945ABG card, but it doesn't seem that Edgy can connect to wireless networks.  lspci knows what the card is, but it doesn't work.
[09:51] <landexem> I've read about the ipw3954 driver... why isn't that in Edgy?
[09:51] <nanaki> dabar: that IP adress that has been given to the PC right? and what ya mean with netbios name
[09:51] <grimboy> !justask | keelbill
[09:51] <ubotu> keelbill: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:51] <Kingsqueak> landexem: when you say it can't connect, how are you trying? with what util?
[09:52] <keelbill> ok i've asked this in several channels
[09:52] <Kingsqueak> landexem: do you see eth1 also   ifconfig -a
[09:52] <dabaR> nanaki: the IP address of the windows computer you are trying to access. Each windows computer has a name, and it is shown in the properties of My Computer, under computer name on XP.
[09:52] <jrs> wtf
[09:52] <keelbill> i have installed nvidia beta drivers
[09:52] <matsn> ifconfig -a
[09:52] <jrs> now i cant eject my cd :s
[09:52] <jrs> help?
[09:52] <jrs> :p
[09:52] <keelbill> before installing them i made a xorg.conf backup
[09:52] <grimboy> jrs, Right click and click unmount
[09:52] <grimboy> jrs, (on the cd icon on the desktop in gnome)
[09:53] <Kingsqueak> landexem: what does  'modprobe -l *3945*'  show you?
[09:53] <jrs> doesnt work..
[09:53] <keelbill> well after installing the nvidia drivers i only get 800x600 res and 50 hz lsited on screen resolution
[09:53] <keelbill> no mattre what
[09:53] <keelbill> so anyone has an idea bout it?
[09:53] <landexem> Kingsqueak: Yeah the modules are loaded and I see eth1, but the card can't detect any networks let alone connect to them.
[09:53] <fbc> lifepositive: sure
[09:53] <jokoon> (any website for programming beginners except google.com ?)
[09:53] <Kingsqueak> landexem: k, so the driver is loaded
[09:53] <landexem> eth1 isn't assigned an IP address for sure
[09:53] <nanaki> dabar:nothing happens I entered the IP and clicked connect and the window disappeared
[09:53] <Kingsqueak> landexem: what util are you using to try to connect?
[09:53] <necronudist> does anyone have the trust spacecam 150 portable webcam?
[09:53] <jrs> lol jakoon :p hotbot.com?
=== lba is now known as slan
[09:54] <jrs> jokoon*
[09:54] <jerp> keelbill, I'd drop the beta drivers since they are still being developed and go to the next highest
[09:54] <nanaki> dabar:wait got something now under network servers
[09:54] <landexem> Kingsqueak: Booting off Edgy x86 live CD, 'System --> Administration --> Networking' and try to enable the wireless card in there.
[09:54] <grimboy> necronudist, Yeah, but I haven't been able to get it working.
[09:54] <keelbill> but i need the beta drivers to run beryl
[09:54] <jerp> typically, betas are in testing
[09:54] <jokoon> bah
[09:54] <lifepositive> fbc: thank you
[09:55] <grimboy> necronudist, But there may be drivers.
[09:55] <Kingsqueak> landexem: ah, not sure with the live-cd, it will definitely work once installed using 'network-manager and network-manager-gnome' via the nm-applet
[09:55] <nanaki> dabar: can it be when I connect to the IP adress that I can get the WHOLE pc connected and can browse any folder in it?
[09:55] <Kingsqueak> landexem: try starting 'nm-applet' from a terminal\
[09:55] <grimboy> keelbill, Have you tried editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[09:55] <necronudist> grimboy mine works, but I see all black
[09:55] <landexem> Kingsqueak: Cool!  Okay so I guess I'll install then.
[09:55] <keelbill> yeah grimboy
[09:55] <Le_Murphant> sry, i'm completely new to linux: from terminal, how do you change your directory to desktop? do you need to type the whole path or just "desktop"? If its the whole path, what is that path?
[09:55] <necronudist> you must use the spc-something drivers
[09:55] <Kingsqueak> landexem: that should put an applet in the system tray, click that and see if it sees networks
[09:55] <keelbill> aven tried my xorg.conf as i had a back up
[09:55] <keelbill> and no luck
[09:55] <jerp> keelbill, how did you get beryl?
[09:55] <it> haha!
[09:56] <keelbill> installed from amaranth's repo
[09:56] <Kingsqueak> landexem: I run a Dell 820 and it has the same driver, works great
[09:56] <Jowi> keelbill, try to insert the output of "gtf 1280x1024 60 -x" into xorg.conf (or whatever resolution refresh rate you want)
[09:56] <it> hi
[09:56] <Kingsqueak> does WEP/WPA/WPA+LEAP no problem
[09:56] <dabaR> nanaki: do you see the computer now? You would have to set up the windows computer to share all the files, which I think can be done by right clicking on a drive icon in My Computer, such as C:
[09:56] <jerp> amaranth doesn't respond to my repository entry :\
[09:56] <keelbill> where do i put that?
[09:56] <it> I no comprehendo
[09:56] <Jowi> keelbill, oops, i meant "gtp 1280 1024 60 -x"
[09:57] <nanaki> dabar: I see both my harddisks and the folders I put up for sharing
[09:57] <grimboy> necronudist, Wow, that has to be the first time I've seen all black mean working.
[09:57] <Jowi> keelbill, in your 'Section "Monitor"'
[09:57] <dabaR> nanaki: then I do not understand what you want changed.
[09:57] <keelbill> i put gtf blah blah on my console
[09:57] <keelbill> lol
[09:57] <necronudist> well, :) I see my hands... see maybe isn't  the right term
[09:57] <keelbill> # 1280x60 @ 0.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: nan kHz; pclk: nan MHz
[09:57] <keelbill>   Modeline "1280x60_0.00"  nan  1280 -2147483648 -2147483648 -2147483648  60 61 64 61  -HSync +Vsync
[09:57] <nanaki> dabar: you helped me already to get back to my PC over my laptop to move files around. Thanks a lot
[09:58] <necronudist> It's like a shado
[09:58] <necronudist> shadow
[09:58] <Jowi> keelbill, yeah that one is wrong. "gtf 1280 1024 60 -x"
[09:58] <necronudist> it means that works
[09:58] <keelbill> ok in front of the other resolutions?
[09:59] <Jowi> keelbill, no, at the end of the Monitor section
[09:59] <dabaR> nanaki: welcome, glad we figured it out. I was looking at a setting in gconf(gconf-editor in a terminal) under system>smb, it shows the workgroup. Maybe if you enter the workgroup of the network there, then you could browse. But it is a guess.
[09:59] <pianoboy3333> How do I check a file with an md5sum?
[09:59] <keelbill> ok done
[09:59] <keelbill> no ""
[09:59] <Jowi> keelbill, 1. in a terminal type in "gtf 1280 1024 60 -x". 2. paste the output from the gtf command at the end of the Monitor section.

[10:01] <necronudist> wow Kingsqueak...can you find something about the spacecam 150 webcam'
[10:01] <necronudist> :D
[10:01] <SurfnKid> is there a floppy i can boot ubuntu with?
[10:01] <necronudist> I give you 5 dollars :)
[10:01] <keelbill> ok done i will restart x
[10:01] <SurfnKid> so i can mount an external drive?
[10:01] <keelbill> brb
[10:02] <grimboy> necronudist, I've just tried it with mine. I'm getting the same thing, really, really dim.
[10:02] <elite_hacker> when i try to use tab completion in bash it refuses to do it unless it believes the file extention is right.  how do i make it not do that?
[10:02] <JPAULEY> I got my machine's wireless card up using ndiswrapper but it stalls -- I have ready that to stop it from crashing I have to change something in the kenrel. How do I get the ubuntu kernel source?
[10:03] <necronudist> ok grimboy... there's no hope for us
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> necronudist: you try using xawtv to view the cam?
[10:03] <hilde> If I want to start dhcp3-server I each time get dhcpd self-test failed. Please fix the config file. the error was:
[10:03] <necronudist> no, camorama and ekiga
[10:03] <Kingsqueak> necronudist: it has adjustments for the image, might be worth trying
[10:03] <hilde> and then nothing is this a bug in Edgy?
[10:03] <necronudist> no it's not a stupid matter of adjustments :)
[10:04] <graveson> my system just hung and upon rebooting and logging in it hangs everytime , just display my panel .i have no idea where to start to troubleshoot this , can anyone help me please :(
[10:04] <necronudist> I'm not searching "ekiga for dummies" :)
[10:04] <Kingsqueak> necronudist: *shrug* had issues with my CCTV cams, and that helped
[10:04] <dabaR> hilde: what command do you start it with?
[10:04] <JPAULEY> Any idea on how to get ndiswrapper to stop crashing and how to get the kernel source for unbuntu?
[10:04] <hilde> dabaR, sudo /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start
[10:04] <dabaR> graveson: create another user, then try logging in with him.
[10:04] <Jowi> elite_hacker, auto completion does not care if the extension is correct.
[10:04] <dabaR> hilde: try sudo invoke-rc.d dhcp3-server restart
[10:05] <elite_hacker> Jowi: then do you have any idea why is it doing it for me?
[10:05] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: apt-cache search linux-source
[10:05] <graveson> dabaR: ok let me try that quickly
[10:05] <hilde> dabaR,  initscript dhcp3-server, action "restart" failed.
[10:05] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: will that get the ubuntu one?
[10:05] <Jowi> elite_hacker, yes. you have several files with similar names
[10:05] <lifepositive> fbc: how goes it?
[10:05] <hilde> dabaR, doesn't work
[10:05] <necronudist> thanks Kingsqueak
[10:05] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: hopefully it won't get the Mandriva one, but I don't know what your sources.list has in it
[10:06] <graveson> dabaR: that worked ,quite strange what is the cause of  this ?
[10:06] <elite_hacker> Jowi: nope, I just tried it an I'm very sure that it refuses to do it even if there's only one file
[10:06] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: All I have to run off is the cd-rom
[10:06] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: ah o.k., it's probably there
[10:06] <jerp> apt-get update: "Failed to fetch http://amaranth.selfip.com/dists/edgy/lrm/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
[10:06] <jerp> "
[10:06] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: try  'sudo apt-get install linux-source'
[10:06] <Jowi> elite_hacker, "ls myfile*" only give you one file?
[10:07] <dabaR> graveson: bad config files somewhere...I expect. try logging into safe gnome session, or whatever it is called as your user, choose it from the session login menu
[10:07] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: no such source... what do I have to do to make my cdrom be on the source list?
[10:07] <elite_hacker> Jowi: correct
[10:07] <dabaR> hilde: did you just install it?
[10:07] <hilde> dabaR, yes
[10:07] <graveson> dabaR: but i change nothing ,so how there be bad config file ? once logging into the failsafe session ,what do i look for
[10:07] <Amaranth> !nvidiabeta | jerp
[10:07] <ubotu> jerp: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) 9629 version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[10:08] <dabaR> hilde: does the same here on install.
[10:08] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: try with the disk in the drive   apt-cdrom add
[10:08] <Jowi> elite_hacker, let's experiment. type in "cat beginningoffilename <tab><tab>" (two tab presses)
[10:08] <dabaR> graveson: nothing see whether you can log in.
[10:08] <hilde> dabaR, ok then its a bug... how can we solve it?
[10:08] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: sorry,  'sudo apt-cdrom add'
[10:08] <dabaR> hilde: Well, I will need a few moments to try what little I am familiar with...
[10:08] <elite_hacker> Jowi: ok, that works no matter what the extension is
[10:08] <cmweb-admin> Ok my next q :p Is any one good with optical mice? I have one from Longitech and it jumps when its moved
[10:08] <hilde> dabaR, I'm trying to follow this http://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/index.php/Ubuntu_PXE_Install
[10:08] <LadyNikon> elite_hacker ... heh
[10:08] <SurfnKid> anyone know if i can make a bootable floppy for ubuntu?
[10:08] <Jowi> elite_hacker, yep.
[10:08] <Jowi> :)
[10:09] <LadyNikon> cute.
[10:09] <jerp> amaranth, thanks, I was looking for the Beryl files and stuff
[10:09] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: I did it but then I still get "Couldn't find package linux-source"
[10:09] <elite_hacker> Jowi: but if i try like unzip foo.txt, it won't do it
[10:09] <wizard_> Anyone here have Starcraft running on wine?
[10:09] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: try  'xset m 3 3' in an xterm , see if that helps
[10:09] <diederick> hi all
[10:10] <cmweb-admin> kingsqueak, in where?
[10:10] <diederick> I want to partition / format my new usb drive
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: in a terminal
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: or a Run dialog
[10:10] <diederick> where I can I find information about doing this?
[10:10] <Jowi> elite_hacker, maybe "unzip" want a valid zip file. I have no idea why.
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: did you make that CD yourself or is it the default install CD?
[10:10] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: meaning the image file itself
[10:10] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, Thanks that was a fast fix :D
[10:11] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: I burned the ISO -- but it is the standard one
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: that won't be permanent though, use the gnome mouse preferences thing or whichever desktop's mouse thing to fix it
[10:11] <pianoboy3333> What are someother good programs that can burn iso's besides nautilus, gnomebaker, and k3b
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: not sure then, you may need to pass a -d /path/to/file with apt-cdrom to get it fixed
[10:11] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: I don't have a CD handy to check
[10:12] <grimboy> necronudist, Turning auto_brightness on helps a bit. I reckon if I adjust the settings enough I can get a semi decent image.

[10:12] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, what do i change
[10:12] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: i'll try it, thanks.... any other idea on how to get ndiswrapper to stop crashing?
[10:12] <jrib> netcatc: what command gave you that problem?
[10:12] <necronudist> grimboy now I'm using ekiga...
[10:12] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: do you have network on that box?  Why not setup apt to fetch from the internet?
[10:12] <pianoboy3333> jrib: ok
[10:12] <graveson> dabaR: the failsafe session works ,but i have no icons nothing on my panel etc . is this normal ?
[10:12] <elite_hacker> Jowi: it does it with a lot of applications.  there must be a list somewhere of applications and their 'proper' extensions.  it's strange that i'm the only one who has this problem :/
[10:12] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: not sure about ndis, I've never really used it
[10:13] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: The whole purpose of this thing is to get my wireless card working :(
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: just set the preferences to something that works with your mouse, accleration and threshold are the things that matter
[10:13] <hilde> dabaR, any luck?
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: got ya
[10:13] <cntb> \o how to add help pages to kde? default is very poor !! unix  man pages only !! I wanted recently to ask help pages in kde for samba for example
[10:13] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: the linux drivers installed and I do a mod probe but it doesn't add any new devices -- any ideas on that?
[10:13] <graveson> dabaR:scratch the last comment ,my pc just hung again
[10:13] <cmweb-admin> Its all up kingsqueak so i guess i got it
[10:13] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: ndis is a bit different, sometimes you need Windows drivers and firmware files for it to work
[10:14] <Jowi> elite_hacker, unzip does the same with me. if I create a file ending in .zip then autocompletion with unzip works. otherwise it doesn't.
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: what wireless card is it exactly?
[10:14] <elite_hacker> oh
[10:14] <fadeaway> hi all
[10:14] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: Asus wl-138G
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: you see the wifi guide on the ubuntu site yet?
[10:14] <Kingsqueak> !wifi | JPAULEY
[10:14] <ubotu> JPAULEY: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:14] <Jowi> elite_hacker, for example "touch testfile.zip" then "unzip testf<tab>"
[10:14] <elite_hacker> yeah
[10:14] <elite_hacker> it's frustrating
[10:14] <netcatc> anybody knows
[10:15] <dabaR> graveson: Not really sure where to start, I am looking at hilde's issue right now at the same time.
[10:15] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: no but I have spent plenty of time on google :(
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: try that guide first
[10:15] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: it came with linux drivers but installing them didn't do jack
[10:15] <SurfnKid> has anyone booted to ubuntu from a flopply?

[10:15] <SurfnKid> floppy?
[10:15] <Kingsqueak> JPAULEY: sorry, I've just not ever used an ndis-wrapper based card so I don't have the instant answer for them
[10:15] <graveson> my system just hung and upon rebooting and logging in it hangs everytime , just display my panel .i have no idea where to start to troubleshoot this , can anyone help me please :(
[10:15] <JPAULEY> Kingsqueak: thanks for your help

[10:19] <deejoe> hi.  In Dapper, what should I look for to use as a sound equilizer?
[10:20] <rioghal> AntiSpamBot, i just installed flashplugin-nonfree and it works great
[10:20] <Kingsqueak> deejoe: a plugin for the media player most likely, you could see if any of the alsamixer has tone controls with your card driver
[10:20] <rioghal> anto, i just installed flashplugin-nonfree and it works great
[10:20] <rioghal> bleh tab completion :(
[10:20] <Kingsqueak> hmm 4:20
[10:20] <deejoe>  Kingsqueak: thanks.  I'll look for that.
[10:21] <Phat32> I just noticed that my sound does not work on firefox when I try to play flash videos. Is this a common problem? Does anyone know the solution?
[10:21] <Kingsqueak> deejoe: varies with your soundcard driver and what is supported, xmms has an EQ in the player, but for general system overall EQ, not sure if there is one that is similar
[10:21] <jokoon> Just ... how install RPM files ?
[10:21] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, are you in florida?
[10:21] <jokoon> !rpm
[10:21] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[10:21] <Kingsqueak> cmweb-admin: Jersey
[10:22] <jokoon> dangerous
[10:22] <rioghal> jokoon, you dont. dont try installing rmp files as it may break things
[10:22] <jokoon> howkeeey
[10:22] <cmweb-admin> i had no idead they had comcast in new jersey
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> Jersey may be a lot of things, but short on broadband it isn't ;-)
[10:22] <jokoon> is rpm the linux's exe ? :)
[10:22] <mark__> jokoon, no
[10:22] <tonyyarusso> jokoon: No, it's Red Hat's package format
[10:22] <Kingsqueak> rpm is a package format, generally for Redhat based systems
[10:23] <Kingsqueak> jokoon: what are you trying to install?
[10:23] <rioghal> jokoon, no, an rpm is a package made for the rehat package manager. ubuntu uses .deb files for packages
[10:23] <dabaR> jokoon: more like setup.exe
[10:23] <jokoon> I remember bittorrent official client was rpm
[10:23] <tonyyarusso> Doesn't have to be
[10:23] <cmweb-admin> Kingsqueak, how i knew: 68-38-166-84.hsd1.nj.comcast.net
[10:23] <jokoon> I did not search a lot for an other file
[10:23] <Kingsqueak> jokoon: do 'apt-cache search bittorrent'  that will show you the clients ubuntu has
[10:23] <cmweb-admin> im going to get booted here in a sec
[10:23] <jokoon> Thanks for the info
[10:23] <Kingsqueak> jokoon: or run synaptic and put bittorrent in the search box
[10:24] <rioghal> jokoon, if youre using ubuntu, you should look for ubuntu .deb packages or stick with the repos
[10:24] <Vardis> anybody have working t10 in linux?

[10:24] <bluefox83> yo..what happened to the ubuntu packages search page?
[10:24] <Kingsqueak> bluefox83: you know about synaptic or 'apt-cache search <whatever>' ?

[10:25] <Vardis> does ubuntu have hotplug by default? or need install by apt-get?

[10:29] <huXfluX> Hello! What antivirus software is the best for a linux distro? clamav, f-prot, avast or other not listed?
[10:29] <vschiavoni> i have a video-tv card and a sblive soundcard. i can't hear any sound while watching the tv..is anyone with my same problem? (ubuntu-edgy here)
[10:29] <gswant> #ubuntu-it
[10:29] <jrs> "is niet aangekoppeld" means is not connected matsn
[10:29] <mcphail> Vardis: not sure. I struggle with hardware questions, i'm afraid! What does dmesg say when you plug it in?
[10:29] <jrib> !virus | huXfluX
[10:29] <ubotu> huXfluX: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
[10:29] <cmweb-admin> ljl, why am i baanned from #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:30] <Vardis> i must look in dmesg but lsusb seeing it
[10:30] <Kingsqueak> huXfluX: if you have a mail server that Win client mail goes through, amavisd is something to look at too
[10:30] <agorf> Kingsqueak, thanks
[10:31] <Kingsqueak> huXfluX: http://www.amavis.org/  though you really only need any of this if you have Windows clients
[10:31] <cmweb-admin> ljl, why am i banned from #ubuntu-offtopic
[10:31] <tonyyarusso> Give him time cmweb-admin
[10:31] <Kingsqueak> agorf: no prob
[10:31] <cmweb-admin> He just signed on
[10:31] <jrs> in gnomebaker i get the following error before i start burning an iso: Error mounting /media/cdrom0.                     what is the solution to this problem??
[10:32] <Jowi> jrs, try "graveman" or another burner and see if that works
[10:32] <Kingsqueak> agorf: not sure if that said, but X isn't encrypted so it's not the most secure thing to run, not a great idea over the internet in particular
[10:32] <|Xabbu> Hi @ll! Sorry to ask a "stupid" question, but is there  a package for "pure-ftpd" for ubuntu 6.08? I'm migrating from SuSe and cannot find any package.
[10:32] <jrs> ok Jowi ... i'll try and i'll try and try............
[10:33] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: apt-cache search pure-ftpd
[10:33] <LjL> cmweb-admin: i haven't the slightest idea
[10:33] <keelbill> :(
[10:33] <keelbill> still the same
[10:33] <|Xabbu> Kingsqueak: : it doesn't find anything.
[10:33] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: if you don't see that, you may need to enable repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list as in universe and multiverse
[10:33] <Jowi> jrs, graveman is quite nice. install it, click on "duplicate cd". select iso in "duplicate from" and you're good to go
[10:34] <tchize> Hello people
[10:34] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: read the file, uncomment the repositories there, run 'sudo apt-get update' and try the search again
[10:34] <Jowi> keelbill, if the modeline didn't help you've got a driver issue.
[10:34] <Doow> Could someone help me with apt-pinning? I looked at the guide at http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html and it seems to only handle prioritizing different repos, I want to pin a package that I installed from an .deb file.
[10:35] <keelbill> aww i can't believe, thi same cfg works on my cousin using a much smaller video card
[10:35] <tchize> i just installed edgy on my computer. At boot time all i get a the blue logo (kubuntu) for about 5 seconds then i get black screen with a blinking cursor. What should i do now??
[10:35] <keelbill> i have fx5500 and's got fx5200
[10:35] <cmweb-admin> Does anyone know how to change a registered name?
[10:36] <scifi> anyone know of a good html editor other than nvu, quanta, bluefish?
[10:36] <Doow> tchize: sounds like a #kubuntu question ^^
[10:36] <Kingsqueak> scifi: has to be a GUI?
[10:36] <Doow> cmweb-admin: registered how?
[10:36] <Kingsqueak> scifi: vim is pretty nice for it
[10:36] <vschiavoni> is anyone using an hauppage bt878 chip-based tv-card with edgy and having sound problems (no sound at all) ?
[10:36] <jrs> Jowi, its started now, hope it'll work... better than gnomebaker, cuz that didn't do anything
[10:36] <Kingsqueak> scifi: or gvim
[10:36] <cmweb-admin> i have my nick passworded
[10:36] <agorf> Kingsqueak, ill have that in mind thanks :)

[10:36] <tchize> doow: well it's a kernel level problem, so no matter the window manager i don't even get something started
[10:36] <jrs> Jowi,  it says operation failed :s
[10:36] <Doow> cmweb-admin: oh, you mean in freenode?
[10:37] <graveson> how i activate the root user,so i can stop 'sudoing'
[10:37] <jrs> after it burns a half a minute

[10:37] <cmweb-admin> its aalready registered i need to change it
[10:37] <Jowi> jrs, try with a different media
[10:37] <cmweb-admin> from cmweb-admin to cmweb
[10:37] <jrs> different cd?
[10:37] <Kyral> I honestly dislike how Vim indents PHP+HTML
[10:37] <Jowi> jrs, your cd disc might be faulty
[10:37] <tchize> and now am really screwed after that edgy installation :'(
[10:37] <rioghal> graveson, thats not supported configuration and also not a good idea as it decreases the security of the system
[10:38] <Kyral> (ABout the only thing I dislike about Vim)
[10:38] <Kingsqueak> Kyral: you can change that though if you want
[10:38] <jrs> Jowi,  i tried already 15discs or so
[10:38] <mcphail> Kyral: CHANGE IT
[10:38] <jrs> :/

[10:38] <mcphail> oops caps!
[10:38] <Kingsqueak> Kyral: heh
=== Vix is now known as Vixus
[10:38] <mcphail> Kyral: sorry - didn't mean to shout
[10:38] <|Xabbu> Kingsqueak: : Thank you!
[10:38] <Jowi> jrs, do you have a cdrw link in /dev ?
[10:38] <Vixus> Damnation, it still refuses to boot!
[10:38] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: ah got it eh, good
[10:38] <Vixus> This time it's definitely not a borked DVD
[10:39] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: you should really do  'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'  to be sure you are up to date
[10:39] <jrs> Jowi,  yes i have, else i couldn't start burning
[10:39] <Vixus> Unpacking linux.... booting kernel.... Hang.
[10:39] <dn4> Anyone know of a good usb controller that is like a PS2 controller?
[10:39] <tchize> Vixus: you too have booting problem? :D
[10:39] <ziro01> Hi
[10:39] <Vixus> tchize: I'm trying to boot the live DVD
[10:40] <Vixus> So I can install Ubuntu for fun and profit.
[10:40] <rioghal> profit???
[10:40] <tchize> hohuu
[10:40] <Jowi> jrs, in graveman. go to File -> prefs and click on the External programs tab. is anything missing there?
[10:40] <tchize> It came back to life!
[10:40] <tchize> it just waited about .... 10 minute with a blinking cursor before :s
[10:41] <Vardis> jrs burn in konsole with cdrecord meyby
[10:41] <Vixus> Will the liveCD not boot if I am trying to use a 64-bit distro with my Sempron processor?
[10:41] <jrs> Jowi, you mean when the button is red its missing?
[10:41] <Vixus> Technical answers please. :D
[10:41] <Jowi> jrs, yes
[10:41] <huXfluX> HELLO! If i forget the root password, do i have to edit the /etc/shadow file alone or BOTH the shadow and passwd files ? Is editing /etc/shadow enough ?
[10:41] <jrs> cuz Flac is red
[10:42] <Vardis> jrs flac is audio fileformat
[10:42] <Jowi> jrs, only flac won't make your cds fail. maybe your burner is faulty then (that is only a guess and nothing else)
[10:42] <tchize> Vixus: can you sempron handle AMD 64 bits instructions? I think not :p
[10:42] <LjL> huXfluX: you shouldn't even *have* a root password to begin with ;-) and what about using the "passwd" command, since it's made for that?
[10:42] <jrs> my burner always worked :(
[10:42] <Vixus> tchize: Well, my distributor said it was a 64-bit processor.
[10:42] <Vardis> Vixus, naah
[10:42] <rioghal> LjL, good catch :)
[10:42] <Vardis> sempron is k8 32 bit processor
[10:42] <Vixus> Bh.
[10:43] <Jowi> jrs, I have no idea :-/
[10:43] <cntb> graveson: !sudo
[10:43] <Vixus> Darn,
[10:43] <jrs> Jowi, could it be because of too high speed burning?
[10:43] <cntb> !sudo
[10:43] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:43] <|Xabbu> Kingsqueak: : Yes, I had only a few sources and only those "restriced".
[10:43] <jrs> cuz i told him to burn on maximum speed
[10:43] <Kingsqueak> |Xabbu: yeah basically enable them all, make it easy
[10:43] <Jowi> jrs, you can try x2 or x4 and see. it can't hurt
[10:44] <profoX`> I want to use password encryption for an application I am writing.. what encryption is the safest one? sha1 is better than md5 i suppose, but are there other recommendations?
[10:44] <jrs> it can hurt my cd's :p
[10:44] <Vixus> I shall have to go for the i386 version then?
[10:44] <jrs> got only a fiew left
[10:44] <Jowi> jrs, get yourself cdrw!
[10:44] <jrs> i got it
[10:44] <jrs> ^
[10:44] <Vixus> Bah, I'll have to waste my DVDRW on a CD image. :P
[10:44] <jrs> but it doesnt blank too :p
[10:44] <jrs> lol
[10:44] <Vixus> or something.
[10:44] <jrs> just strange error
[10:44] <theD3viL>  which program is for command play$?
[10:44] <Kingsqueak> profoX`: des aes, there are many, what lang are you writing in is the key to what you use
[10:44] <Vardis> Vixus you can i686 use to
[10:44] <jrs> it doesnt burn or blank
[10:44] <Jowi> jrs, it must blank. got to be a faulty burner
[10:45] <Vixus> Vardis: Is there an i686 ubuntu distro?
[10:45] <rioghal> huXfluX, graveson : suppose i wanted to break into your computer.. i know you have a root account and i can try to break into that but if the root account is disabled i cant break into it and i dont know the other user accouns you have :)
[10:45] <theD3viL>  which program is for command play$?
[10:45] <jrs> it always did on shitmzoft windoz
[10:45] <tchize> Vixus: then i am just mixing name, don't take into account what i wrote (still trying to figure why my cpu when out to smoke a cigaret before booting)
[10:45] <Jowi> jrs, graveman -> other operations -> Erase CDRW
[10:45] <Vardis> Vixus, i386 for mi changed to 686
[10:45] <Vixus> Vardis: mi?
[10:46] <Vardis> i mient me
[10:46] <Kingsqueak> profoX`: the password itself is more important really, if you md5 'cat' it can be quickly cracked anyway
[10:47] <Vixus> Vardis: Um, so can I get an i686 Ubuntu distro or must I do some messing about myself?
[10:47] <Vardis> jrs try in komand line cdrecord dev=ATA:0,0,0 file.iso
[10:47] <phanter> hi there. When connecting to my network with my laptop the speed was usually quite slow (up and download speed). After some time I used the same laptop with winxp and speeds went up. Why is the speed low in ubuntu (I am back on ubuntu of course)?
[10:47] <Vardis> Vixus, take i 386 distro it vill change bi hiself to 686
[10:47] <Kingsqueak> profoX`: might want to also look at cracklib2 to enforce strong passwords
[10:47] <LjL> !generic | Vardis, Vixus
[10:47] <ubotu> Vardis, Vixus: Background to the decision to replace -386, -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html
[10:47] <dabaR> phanter: wireless?
[10:47] <profoX`> Kingsqueak: i know, but i'm just asking what is best.. storing it plaintext is not an option either now is it :)
[10:48] <phanter> not wireless, wired :0
[10:48] <Kingsqueak> profoX`: yeah just sayin', md5 should be decent enough
[10:48] <Kingsqueak> profoX`: it's good enough for /etc/shadow
[10:48] <phanter> and it is an IBM thinkpad (usually great drivers in linux)
[10:48] <Megaqwerty> how do I set samba to share my files in a different domain (i.e. one different than MSHOME)?
[10:48] <theD3viL> which program is for command play$?
[10:48] <mcphail> Kingsqueak: hmm. not here it isn't
[10:49] <Vixus> So basically... I just install the base distro. :D
=== NaMc-AWAY is now known as NaMcO^
[10:49] <rioghal> probins, what are you doing storing text or are you wanting a decent encrypt/decrypt app
[10:49] <Yasu0> n8
[10:49] <LjL> Vixus: uh... yes?
[10:49] <rioghal> profoX`, what are you doing storing text or are you wanting a decent encrypt/decrypt app
[10:49] <Vixus> Here I was thinking I had a 64-bit processor. :(
[10:50] <Megaqwerty> can anyone help me with my samba issue? ^^^
[10:50] <profoX`> rioghal: storing user passwords
[10:50] <LjL> Vixus: look, i'm not sure what you're saying. i386 is the architecture - clearly, few of use actually have a *386* processor, since it's sort of old, you know... but the distribution works with newer ones well enough :D
[10:50] <rioghal> profoX`, ok'
[10:50] <dabaR> Megaqwerty: you installed samba on the computer you want to share files from?
[10:50] <Vixus> LjL: I thought I needed the amd64 distribution
[10:50] <LjL> Vixus: if you have a 64-bit processor, you may decide to install the 64-bit version. but i think most people use the 32-bit version for compatibility purposes
[10:50] <Megaqwerty> dabaR: yes
[10:50] <agent> what is the difference between ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard?
[10:51] <profoX`> so.. what about blowfish? could that be used for storing passwords?
[10:51] <rioghal> probins, if youre looking for an app to do that in a safe way i might suggest mcrypt  i use that for all sevisitive text files
[10:51] <Vixus> LjL: The current issue I am having is that my liveCD won't boot.
[10:51] <rioghal> !mcrypt
[10:51] <ubotu> mcrypt: Replacement for old unix crypt(1). In component universe, is optional. Version 2.6.4-3.2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 63 kB, installed size 260 kB
[10:51] <LjL> Vixus: well, that's not processor related. where does it hang?
[10:51] <Megaqwerty> dabaR: it is sharing the files fine, just on MSHOME, not the workgroup (domain, whatever) I want it to be on
[10:51] <dabaR> Megaqwerty: well, then you need to change the domain name in /etc/samba/smb.conf or similar, and then all the windows clients have to change their workgroup, which is done by right clicking the my computer icon, then properties, then computer name
[10:51] <Jowi> agent, ubuntu-minimal basicly boots so you can install more things
[10:51] <Vixus> LjL: At "Booting kernel..."
[10:51] <Vardis> i hawe question about edgy do somody know the problem with xorg on amd sempron?
[10:52] <LjL> Vixus: have you verified it?
[10:52] <hult> hey guyz
[10:52] <Xal2> Is there a way to relocate the setup files on an Ubuntu install disk to /ubuntu rather than having everything in the root of the CD?
[10:52] <bz029> Aloha everyone
[10:52] <hult> #need some help
[10:52] <agent> Jowi: and ubuntu-standard? also, which one is installed when doing a basic server install?
[10:52] <Vixus> LjL: Yes. All clear.
[10:52] <hult> just installed ubuntu desktop.
[10:52] <AAA1> Hi all, I'm a complete newbie, is this the place for kubuntu questions?
[10:52] <hult> and my ps/2 mouse isnt working ?
[10:52] <Xal2> There must be a place where the locations of the install files are specified.
[10:52] <Vixus> LjL: Actually, the first time I burned it, verification failed. This time it went fine,
[10:52] <dabaR> AAA1: this and #kubuntu
[10:52] <Xal2> AAA1: go to #kubuntu
[10:52] <AAA1> thanks
[10:52] <Megaqwerty> dabaR: I did, and it still shows me on MSHOME
[10:52] <Jowi> agent, not sure. probably both.
[10:52] <AAA1> will do
[10:52] <agent> Jowi: ok, thank you
[10:53] <Xal2> Is there a way to relocate the setup files on an Ubuntu install disk to /ubuntu rather than having everything in the root of the CD?
[10:53] <hult> anyone
[10:53] <dabaR> Megaqwerty: did you restart samba?
[10:53] <hult> ?
[10:53] <Megaqwerty> dabaR: not only that, I rebooted the computer
[10:53] <LjL> Vixus: try adding the "acpi=off" and/or the "noapic" kernel parameter
[10:53] <Vardis> hult did you chek the xorgconfig
[10:53] <AngryElf> has anyone had success with a bcm43xx card in edgy?
[10:53] <dabaR> hult: what does not working mean? it does not earn money? does it appear on the screen at all?
[10:53] <Vixus> LjL: Ok, what do those do, out of interest?
[10:53] <bz029> I have a question about ubuntu and MySQL if anyone here is familiar with those two together... my question is about the debian user that is created in MySQL when i install MySQL from the apt-get
[10:53] <dabaR> Megaqwerty: show me your smb.conf on a pastebin, and show me the exact path of the file.
[10:53] <hilde> dabaR, I don't think that the how-to is related to this problem
[10:53] <hult> dabaR: it works in grub perfect when ubuntu laods it dose not repsond
[10:54] <dabaR> hilde: did you try following it?
[10:54] <hilde> dabaR, if I do dpkg-reconfigure dhcp3-server it won't work correct... it ask a device eth0
[10:54] <bz029> I also want to know if I can use the XGL cool ass graphics/desktop stuff in PPC Ubuntu
[10:54] <LjL> Vixus: disable ACPI the former, something i don't really know the latter. they're known to enable booting on systems where ubuntu doesn't boot, so they're just a standard suggestion we give when the CD fails to boot
[10:54] <hilde> dabaR, no
[10:54] <Vixus> LjL Wil try
[10:54] <hilde> dabaR, I don't understand it
[10:54] <rioghal> gotta go back in a bit
[10:54] <Vixus> Is that noapic or noapci?
[10:55] <Vardis> quit
[10:55] <hult> dabaR: any ideas ?
[10:55] <Vixus> *noacpi
[10:55] <dabaR> hult: a mouse can not work in grub.

[10:56] <klamsd> Hi can anyone help me
[10:56] <bz029> klamsd what is your question?
[10:56] <mark__> what does the section "inputdevice" read in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:56] <hilde> dabaR, at this line it already fails On what network interfaces should the DHCP server listen? <-- eth0
[10:56] <hilde> It does not accept eth0
[10:56] <Megaqwerty> dabaR: I pasted it here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32810/ (I "*" my personal data for security reasons)
[10:57] <dabaR> hilde: but that is the interface you want it to listen to?
[10:57] <Daviey> Hi guys..  Trying to mount and/or burn an *.img file.  Any tips?  winISO under WINE doesn't like it.  Neither does gnomebaker or k3b

[11:32] <bunnythebunny> what is acpi?

[11:47] <LjL> cmweb: i haven't a clue, i use KDE
[11:47] <Jowi> ispiked, first make sure you have no other apps using apt (aptitude, synaptic) If no apps are using the lock, delete it.
[11:47] <ispiked> Jowi: they're not, I just restarted. will do.
[11:47] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, u have any other os installed?
[11:48] <Vixus> Should I assign the biggest partition to /home or /usr??
[11:48] <Vixus> or /?
[11:48] <mikeym> are there any problem with the package repositories atm?
[11:48] <Vixus> I've given a 2GB partition to /
[11:48] <mikeym> problems*
[11:48] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, like win or other distro?
[11:48] <Vixus> or was that wrong?
[11:48] <LjL> mikeym: don't know, which mirror?
[11:48] <ispiked> Vixus: /home is the biggest for me. I have music and movies on it.
[11:48] <mikeym> i'll go look, but I can't access packages.ubuntu.com either
[11:48] <Vixus> "/" only needs 2GB, right?
[11:48] <LjL> mikeym: yes, packages.ubuntu.com definitely has problems
[11:49] <van|mugenglider-> i did, but when i tried to run the live cd it would give me some error messages after the ubuntu screen was loading, so i used fdisk to delete/create the partion, the now everytime i try load it that message pops up
[11:49] <LjL> Vixus: wrong. 2GB seems really, really little
[11:49] <Vixus> oh
[11:49] <Vixus> :D
[11:49] <Vixus> I have 20GB to spare
[11:49] <gnat_x> hi, i'm using xubuntu edgy release in live mode to try and write some files to an existing ntfs/windows XP drive. i'm trying to use ntfsmount, which is present in live mode, but am getting fuse errors. anyone have an insight?
[11:49] <Vixus> 1GB is swap
[11:49] <LjL> Vixus: i usually make / 10Gb, but then i have a separate /home partition
[11:49] <Vixus> ok
[11:49] <Vixus> cool
[11:49] <mikeym> whoops, didn't uncomment some lines in my sources.list
[11:49] <LjL> Vixus: what kind of setup are you thinking about?
[11:49] <mikeym> my bad
[11:49] <Jowi> Vixus, 2GB is not enough for /
[11:49] <dooglus> Vixus: if you have separate partitions for everything in / then you don't need / to be very big at all
[11:49] <Vixus> Am dual-booting
[11:49] <Vixus> is why
[11:50] <Vixus> 40/40 windows/linux
[11:50] <Vixus> sorry
[11:50] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, if u dont want ur win/otherOS any more, u can try to boot from the disk(aka. live CD)
[11:50] <Vixus> I have 20GB to install linux on
[11:50] <Jowi> Vixus, if you go for minimal install ubuntu need 2.5 GB just to unpack the files for installation. I would recommend 6GB for /
[11:50] <LjL> Vixus, yes, but what kind of partitioning setup are you thinking of for linux?
[11:50] <Vixus> i have no idea
[11:50] <ispiked> Vixus: I'd make /home the biggest.
[11:50] <humi> is there a way to install ubuntu in text mode using 6.10 livecd? it hangs during boot.
[11:50] <dooglus> Vixus: I only have 3.6G for the whole system, including /home, and am only using 3.2G.  I have KDE, GNOME, XFCE4 all installed no problem
[11:50] <Vixus> I could just dump everything in /
[11:51] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, setup the BIOS to boot from ur cd/dvd rom
[11:51] <van|mugenglider-> it doesnt even get the chance to, ive already set it to booting the cd first but that msg still pops up
[11:51] <hilde> I seem to fail to start running dhcp3 can somebody help me!
[11:51] <Vixus> I don't need a seperate partition for /home, do I?
[11:51] <Vixus> what purpose would it sev
[11:51] <LjL> Vixus: well, if you only keep one partition, then just make it 20 gigs. if you want / and /home, i agree with jowi on the approximate size for /. if you make an /usr partition as well, then dunno
[11:51] <Vixus> other than in the event of a reinstall?
[11:51] <philip> can anyone help me view the contents of my windows pc via ubuntu networking?
[11:51] <Vixus> ok
[11:51] <Vixus> thanks
[11:51] <Vixus> 10GB should be fine
[11:51] <ironfroggy> if i get absolutely no errors installing grub, what can i look for as to why it wont go past stage 1.5?
[11:51] <dooglus> Vixus: the point of having a separate partition for /home is that you might well fill up /home, but you don't want to fill up / because it can damage the OS
[11:52] <dooglus> Vixus: but no, you don't have to have a separate /home partition, and I don't
[11:52] <LjL> Vixus: well, if you fill up /home, and it's a separate partition, your system won't go all crazy ;) also, if / becomes corrupted, there's a chance /home doesnt. and then reinstalls, yeah
[11:52] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, that souldnt happen...
[11:52] <Jowi> night all
[11:52] <humi> ironfroggy: maybe unsupported file system
[11:52] <LjL> Vixus: anyway if you are *not* going to have a separate /home partition, then i really don't understand your rationale for thinking of making a tiny 2Gb partition
[11:52] <sky123> philip: many of "directives" for allowing you to do so are in smb.conf in /etc
[11:52] <ironfroggy> humi: ext3
[11:52] <humi> ah
[11:52] <sky123> philip: a quick search on ubuntu samba should yield pertinent info.
[11:52] <hilde> nobody?
[11:52] <van|mugenglider-> it is, i just doubled checked
[11:53] <sycho> ironfroggy: I found mine dual boot wouldn't go past 1.5 if I loaded grub onto my windows partition
[11:53] <philip> sky123:  i have been looking i've googles aload of times
[11:53] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, try to boot from ur win disk if that's working then probably ur ubuntu disk's problem
[11:53] <ironfroggy> sycho: not dual booting and im installing to the MBR
[11:53] <cmweb> Iw will never go back to windows again..... ahh
[11:53] <van|mugenglider-> i tried both, still same message
[11:53] <humi> ironfroggy: sda?
[11:53] <philip> sky123: i've just got windows to find ubuntu, but ubuntu cant find windows
[11:53] <ironfroggy> humi: what is sda again?
[11:53] <mc__> is the eclipse bug fixed in feisty?
[11:53] <hipitihop> sorry I was away from my terminal and did not notice if someone responded to my NIS problem. If someone did could you please re-respond
[11:53] <Vixus> I've got 3GB swap now
[11:53] <humi> ironfroggy: your first drive (in case of sata)
[11:53] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, how abot a floppy disk?
[11:54] <LjL> Vixus: 3Gb swap seems a bit excessive IMHO
[11:54] <Vixus> i know :D
[11:54] <Vixus> how much?
[11:54] <sky123> philip: in /etc/samba/smb.conf there is a workgroup parameter...change it to your workgroup
[11:54] <humi> mc__: what bug?
[11:54] <sycho> ironfroggy, ok. For me I'm dual boot, but when I instaled grub to the MBR on my windows partition I got that error. But when I removed the MBR from my XP partition and installed grub onto my linux partition it worked fine
[11:54] <LjL> Vixus: how much RAM do you have? make your swap at least as big as your RAM.
[11:54] <Vixus> 1GB
[11:54] <Vixus> :P
[11:54] <ironfroggy> humi: oh, its not sata and its hda and grub configured for (hd0) and root at (hd0,0)
[11:54] <van|mugenglider-> ya  tried that, but when i try to run winxp/ubuntu setups, it says it cant run on dos
[11:54] <mc__> humi: the eclipse package in edgy does not work
[11:54] <LjL> Vixus: i think little in excess of 1Gb of RAM will be fine (make it 1.2Gb or so)
[11:54] <gnomefreak> mc__: nothing is fixed in feisty
[11:55] <humi> ironfroggy: hmm, seems fine
[11:55] <ag_> Does anyone know which HDx grub uses for sata disks when you have IDE and sata on a system?
[11:55] <IneedHelp> For some reason I can't connect to my wireless network using my laptop can someone help me?
[11:55] <ironfroggy> sycho: if there is no boot record on the MBR, how do you boot?
[11:55] <mc__> gnomefreak: alright
[11:55] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell IneedHelp about wifi
[11:55] <humi> mc__: that's a shame
[11:55] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, ya it can run on dos for xp/ubuntu
[11:55] <mc__> ag_:  sata is sd*
[11:55] <sycho> Like i said I reinstalled the MBR to my linux partition, and have my bios boot that drive first
[11:55] <mc__> humi: a big shame!
[11:55] <cmweb> ljl, i dont know if you remember about 3 hours ago we were talking about apache and php. Do you know what i need to add to what file for php to work.
[11:56] <Vixus> Now I've got this little 1GB of space I can't do anything with because it won't be added to any other partition>...
[11:56] <ag_> mc_:  Thanks, I can't get command line grub to see the partition!
[11:56] <IneedHelp> I can connect using windows but while running 6.06 I can't connect
[11:56] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, im not sure, but it really shouldnt happen if u set ur bios right
[11:56] <LjL> cmweb: yes, i was going to tell you, but you quit. weren't you in the process of upgrading to edgy anyway?
[11:56] <van|mugenglider-> ya thats what i dont get it is setup right
[11:56] <ironfroggy> sycho: im not understanding. the MBR cant be on a partition, but definition. and you cant point the bios to a partition, just to a disc.
[11:56] <cmweb> yeah im finishing tonight i got 3 21 MB fiels to download
[11:56] <humi> mc__: try netbeans :)
[11:57] <ladydoor> so when trying to start Emacs w/gtk support on Dapper, it invariably loads for a while and then presents a bunch of meaningless blocks of non-text. When copy/pasted into TTY emacs, these translate into an error talking about how whatever font I've set (or the default font, if none is set) is ``undefined.'' does anybody know what causes this behavior and how to fix it? I've tried setting the font to a number of aliases and full f
[11:57] <ladydoor> ont names pulled from elsewhere in my .Xresources and from xlsfonts and from xfontsel, and i've tried setting these both in my .Xresources and in my .emacs file. anybodby have any info?
[11:57] <LjL> cmweb: then i suggest you want until you have edgy running
[11:57] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, if u have more that one hard drive unplug this one and try other one
[11:57] <modified54> got an easy one.  i don't know syntax in the terminal to install a driver w/ ndiswrapper.  do i have to write out the entire file path for the driver or put it somwhere specific?
[11:57] <humi> ironfroggy: what's your root partition?
[11:57] <mc__> humi: netbeans is no alternative ,i use eclipse for rails development
[11:57] <cmweb> ok, thanks then hopefuly next time i talk to yawl il be aan edgy user LOL
[11:57] <humi> mc__: ah..
[11:57] <ladydoor> modified54: if you cd to the dir where the driver is, you can just install from there
[11:57] <sycho> ironfroggy, I know.. I have 2 sata drives in my system.. 1 xp, 1 ubuntu..  I installed the MBR on the ubuntu drive, and pointed my bois to boot my ubuntu drive frist
[11:57] <ironfroggy> humi: hda1
[11:57] <brkamikaze> hi
[11:57] <LjL> cmweb: chances are that in edgy you won't have to do anything manually for php to work. and on the other hand, if you change stuff manually now while in dapper, it could complicate matters later in edgy
[11:57] <hipitihop> Anyone here know how to get a NIS server running ? When starting NIS I get "Starting NIS services: ypserv yppasswdd ypxfrd ypbind [binding to YP server ....backgrounded] 
[11:58] <ladydoor> modified54: or you can give the full path, whatever you prefer
[11:58] <ironfroggy> sycho: oh, well im trying to do basically that but without the xp disc
[11:58] <van|mugenglider-> i dont have any at my disposal, im jsut using one of my old cpus with a 2.7gb hd
[11:58] <sky123> modified4: as sudo su, its ndiswrapper -i  somefile.inf
[11:58] <brkamikaze> is it possible to customize Edgy's alternative install CD to make it include my language without the need for a new download every install?
[11:58] <sycho> ironfroggy, I understand. My problem came from XP. not Ubuntu when i got my 1.5 error
[11:58] <humi> mc__: google helps: http://www.radrails.org/ :)
[11:58] <philip> sky123: was aleady correct, i've changed it previously.
[11:59] <TuTUx> van|mugenglider-, 2.7g is a little bit small for ubuntu..
[11:59] <mc__> humi: so what do you mean?
[11:59] <sky123> philip: are you familiar with smbclient and trying to conenct via command line?
[11:59] <mc__> humi: radrails is an eclipse plugin
[11:59] <kameron> can someone help me with a dual monitor setup?
[12:00] <philip> sky123: pretty sure i have but refresh my memory please
[12:00] <van|mugenglider-> o... well either way i still have the problem of the misssing operating system
[12:00] <humi> mc__: oh..
[12:00] <sky123> philip: hang on im refreshin gmy knowledge as well
[12:00] <mc__> humi:  :)
