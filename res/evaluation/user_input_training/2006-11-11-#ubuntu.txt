[12:00] <crimsun> tpc247: documented in the ipx package.
[12:00] <presto> any ideas how to get xvid to play with mplayer
[12:01] <jrib> ubotu: tell andreasdk about w32codecs
[12:01] <presto> isnt it supposed to?
[12:01] <nothlit> nalioth, oh >< is that what it needs? wouldn't it have to say gtk+-2.0-dev ?
[12:01] <Kingsqueak> shwag: chown is the one that 'ch'anges 'own'ership
[12:01] <Jimbo> i just changed the filesystem to fat, the drive only has one partition hdb1
[12:01] <shwag> Kingsqueak: duh. but for every new created file automatically.
[12:01] <Kingsqueak> you can't
[12:01] <Kingsqueak> wtf would you ever want to do that for anyway?
[12:01] <andreasdk> There is no package called mplayer-plugin and i have all repos enabled
[12:01] <nothlit> jrib,  mplayer plays windows files by itself i think
[12:01] <tpc247> crimsun: if I understand you correctly, I typed 'man ipx' but got the following: 'No manual entry for ipx'
[12:02] <jrib> andreasdk: mozilla-mplayer in multiverse
[12:02] <bjorn_> anybody know what I should do when sound recorder tells me my Audio capture settings are invalid. I'm told to correct them in the multimedia settings, but I don't know where that is
[12:02] <jrib> nothlit: maybe, I know the latest version does.  But I am not sure if the one in the repos does
[12:02] <shwag> how do I make /etc/login.defs  take effect. do I have to restart init ?
[12:02] <crimsun> tpc247: apropos ipx
[12:02] <nothlit> andreasdk, mozilla-mplayer
[12:02] <crimsun> bjorn_: ``gstreamer-properties''
[12:02] <doctormo> help! gnome won't start, it's having problems using dbus, standard install of Dapper, all we did was remove wallpaper-tray and restart computer.
[12:02] <Jimbo> nothlit: i just changed the filesystem to fat, the drive only has one partition hdb1
[12:02] <jrib> andreasdk: you may want to try without w32codecs first because of what nothlit said
=== heikkit_ is now known as heikkit
=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as skry
[12:03] <Jimbo> if i re install the os again is could it see the hard drive easier?
[12:03] <tpc247> crimsun: yeah I tried that, and got 'ipx: nothing appropriate.'  :-(
=== skry is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[12:04] <shwag> Kingsqueak: umask does the trick, but the change didnt take effect.
[12:04] <bjorn_> crimsun: I see you got a lot to do, so please say if I'm bothering you :) I get this message when I try to test the input device: ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture: Could not open resource for writing.
[12:04] <Jimbo> what if i delete the partition then format it again could that help?
[12:04] <nothlit> Jimbo, sudo mkdir /media/hdb1                                 echo /dev/hdb1    /media/hdb1 vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0 | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
[12:04] <crimsun> bjorn_: what source is it set to ?
[12:05] <Jimbo> ok
[12:05] <nothlit> Jimbo, there are two commands in there
[12:05] <crimsun> tpc247: look at dpkg -L ipx, then
[12:05] <nothlit> Jimbo, after that sudo mount -a
[12:05] <andreasdk> Just tried with and without w32codecs and mozilla-player but the darn thing still wont work. Can someone please help me through a remote desktop?
[12:05] <bjorn_> Input: ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
[12:05] <Jimbo> its hard to keep up with the room movin so fast
[12:05] <nothlit> andreasdk, did you shut down firefox in between?
[12:05] <depon> hey everyone... can anybody help with the installation of a sagem fast 800 on edgy/dapper? tried some guides, none seem to work :(
[12:05] <philc> why isn't mod_deflate enabled by default on all apache installations? Does it have any caveats?
[12:05] <andreasdk> Nope - 2 secs
[12:06] <nothlit> andreasdk, you could just install the mediaplayerconnectivity extension if you're having trouble, if not theres still a vlc plugin and a gstreamer plugin
[12:06] <tpc247> crimsun: wow, thanks.  I never knew about dpkg -L, but you have opened my eyes.  Danke.
[12:06] <odisseia> oiii
[12:06] <xd45> hey folks, I upgraded to edgy and now firefox 2.0 crashes everytime I open it, anyone have any ideas?
[12:06] <odisseia> someone in portugal?
[12:07] <nalioth> nothlit: yes, gtk*-dev will do it
[12:07] <bjorn_> crimsun: Input:  Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
[12:07] <presto> hmmmm vlc would play the xvid but not mplayer or totem wonder why
[12:07] <honk> anyone know how to configure gnome launch box?
[12:07] <andreasdk> nothlit> It still doesn`t work. Could i please get you to help through remote desktop? Kinda hard typing with a baby in one arm.....
[12:07] <shwag> What calls /etc/login.defs ?
[12:08] <depon> has anybody got a sagem fast 800 to work on edgy or dapper?
[12:08] <nothlit> nalioth, which do i install gdk-imlib-dev   or  gdk-imlib11-dev
[12:08] <xd45> nobody has had any issues with firefox xrashing?
[12:08] <Kingsqueak> shwag: if you told me why you want every file created by a user to be executable, I might have another suggestion to fix that for you
[12:08] <xd45> crashing rather
[12:08] <xd45> oh, mozilla crashes too
[12:08] <xd45> weird.
[12:09] <shwag> Kingsqueak: you are a nosey one aren't you. ever heard of Ruby on Rails? Well it needs files writable by the group.
[12:09] <nothlit> andreasdk, I suppose, but you know that vnc if it isnt done through ssh is not encrypted?
[12:09] <xd45> moved my .mozilla dir and it is still crashing so thats not it
[12:09] <infidel> need help installing fglrx 8.30.3 on a amd64 machine running 32 bit ubuntu
[12:09] <Kingsqueak> writeable is not executable
[12:09] <nothlit> andreasdk, have you tried installing the mediaplayerconnectivity extension in firefox?
[12:09] <Kingsqueak> that's why I asked
[12:09] <nothlit> andreasdk, it should work quite well
[12:10] <Kingsqueak> umask 002 would fix group write
[12:10] <shwag> how can I tell what package owns a particular file ?
[12:10] <Kingsqueak> chmod 775 on the dir parents would too
[12:10] <Kingsqueak> and asking, particularly with a web application is being helpful
[12:10] <Kingsqueak> not understanding permissions with a web accessible app is just begging to be rooted
[12:10] <jrib> shwag: dpkg -S /path/to/file
[12:10] <nothlit> shwag, right click properties or go to that directory and  ls -l
[12:11] <MenZaLap> Can anyone tell me how (if) I can enable the user sidebar to the right in xchat gnome?
[12:11] <nothlit> shwag, oh oops package not user sorry
[12:11] <bjorn_> Crimsun: Could you look at another pastebin for me? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30904/
[12:11] <Jimbo> nothlit...i got a directory in filesystem/media named hdb1 but cant make a folder there
[12:11] <Keyseir> How should I go about mounting an external HD in edgy?
[12:11] <jbroome> get it drunk first
[12:11] <andreasdk> nothlit: It still doesn`t work. I`ll take my chances.
[12:11] <bakert> Keyseir, what happens when you plug it in?
[12:12] <nalioth> nothlit: the one that most corresponds to your project will do
[12:12] <nothlit> Jimbo, oh then youve already got a folder there
[12:12] <Keyseir> Nothing noticeable.
[12:12] <Jimbo> no it just appeared after i ran the commands you said
[12:12] <Keyseir> It's on and fine according to the status lights, I had it connected when I was on breezy
[12:12] <Jimbo> i dont know if i ran them correctly tho
[12:12] <Keyseir> But on breezy I mounted it through the "Disk" UI under the "System" menu
[12:12] <K1765> Yo. Got a stupid question.
[12:12] <nothlit> nalioth, how can i tell? it just says gdk-2.0 doesnt say if its imlib or imlib1 or imlib11
[12:12] <K1765> How do I turn my pc volume up?
[12:12] <Keyseir> I can't find a similar "Disk" menu on edgy
[12:12] <Jimbo> lemee check size of folder
[12:13] <jrib> andreasdk: when you play a video does it actually say "mplayer plugin" before the video shows up?
[12:13] <salim> @Jimbo: hi, where is hdb1 mounted?
[12:13] <nothlit> Jimbo, then do echo /dev/hdb1    /media/hdb1 vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask=000  0    0 | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
[12:13] <nothlit> Jimbo, thats one command
[12:13] <nalioth> nothlit: well, try one, if it doesnt work, install the other. apt-get won't let you get into a bind with conflicting stuff
[12:13] <crimsun> bjorn_: does it work if you set audiosource to oss ?
[12:13] <Jimbo> k one sec...or two :)
[12:13] <K1765> How do I turn my pc volume up?
[12:14] <tpc247> xd45: yes firefox and swiftfox crash on me, but only when I try to view certain kinds of video through mplayer-plugin
[12:14] <andreasdk> jrib: It asks whether i want to use the standard movie player and when i select yes it says that it needs some more modules to play -wmv
[12:14] <xd45>  tpc247 it crashes for me on just about any page
[12:14] <jrib> andreasdk: what file is this?
[12:14] <nothlit> andreasdk, then you can set that up and make sure theres a clear path to port 5900 and gimme your ip,
[12:14] <tnnc> i am using 6.06 and i need to upgrade kernell so it will run smp what do i need to install
[12:15] <tsoler> guys: how can i see which version of ubuntu im runing?
[12:15] <tpc247> xd45: oh that's not good.  I'm a new Ubuntu user so I couldn't guess why
[12:15] <tang^> I just did an upgrade to edgy and some fonts don't display: urxvt using xrdb font doesn't, but using that same font descriptor with urxvt -fn does.
[12:15] <xd45> I am about to just remove the ubuntu packages and install from tar
[12:15] <andreasdk> nothlit: Can`t i send you an invite through email?
[12:15] <nothlit> andreasdk, you could also uninstall the mozilla mplayer plugin and then install mozilla-plugin-vlc , you have to remember to restart firefox every time you do one action though
[12:15] <jsmith88> tnnc: you need to install the smp kernel
[12:15] <Keyseir> Nobody can tell me how to mount a drive on edgy? =(
[12:15] <K1765> How do I turn my pc volume up?
[12:15] <nothlit> andreasdk, wait then i'll run a listening vlc viewer and tell you how to use x11vncserver
[12:15] <tang^> I found a bunch of stuff online about locales that look like its relevent, but nothing appears to be changing my system
[12:15] <Jimbo> nothlit..i pasted in that command but no change
[12:15] <tnnc> jsmith88 what should i search for?
[12:16] <jsmith88> tnnc: so do a search in synaptic for smp and install the kernel relevant to your architecture
[12:16] <salim> @Jimbo: I think you have to reboot
[12:16] <bjorn_> Crimsun: there's sound :) Still it's really bad. A lot of background noise, and it's distorted
[12:16] <K1765> How do I turn my mic volume up???
[12:16] <jsmith88> tnnc: are you using an x86 processor? like a p4 or core2 duo?
[12:16] <nothlit> Jimbo, no then you type sudo mount -a
[12:16] <Jimbo>  the folder has a size of 99.9 gigs but i cant make a subfoler or file ther
[12:16] <nothlit> Jimbo, then look in the media folder
[12:16] <Jimbo> ok
[12:16] <nothlit> Jimbo, thats not what the mkdir command does
[12:16] <K1765> HOW DO I CLOSE A PROGRAM FROM TERMINAL?
[12:16] <gaussian88> K1765: if you have the sound-applet in the gnome panel enabled (assuming you're on gnome) just double-click it, then adjust to your liking
[12:17] <up365> K1765: do have a speaker icon to click on
[12:17] <tnnc> jsmith88, it is xeon daul 550 x86
[12:17] <nothlit> Jimbo if youre still confused paste the contents of  ls /media         and ls /media/hdb1
[12:17] <nalioth> K1765: watch the caps, and "depends on the program" try ctrl-q or ctrl-c or /quit
[12:17] <K1765> OOHH
[12:17] <crimsun> bjorn_: so turn down the mic and capture volumes
[12:17] <K1765> I see it now, thanks!
[12:17] <gaussian88> K1765: type this:  ps -ael |grep <name of program>
[12:17] <tnnc> jsmith88, P3
[12:17] <jsmith88> tnnc: you can try installing the following package: linux-686-smp
[12:17] <Jimbo> nothlit...YOU DID IT!!!!
[12:17] <gaussian88> K1765: then do:  kill <process ID>
[12:18] <nothlit> Jimbo :)
[12:18] <Jimbo> yer good
[12:18] <Xaxafrad> quick question from a relative *nix newb: i think i might be having compatibility issues and was wondering what shell is running when i open a terminal in xubuntu?
[12:18] <gaussian88> K1765: or use 'top' to get the process ID
[12:18] <nothlit> Jimbo, its in ubuntuguide.org if you want to take a longer route next time
[12:18] <Jimbo> so in linux the hard drives appear as folders ?
[12:18] <K1765> Thanks gauss
[12:18] <gaussian88> K1765: type 'man top' to get some of the top commands
[12:18] <gaussian88> K1765: top is your friend
[12:19] <K1765> Yes it is, already love it lol
[12:19] <nothlit> Jimbo, what happens is you get to choose where you hard drive gets put in the filesystem
[12:19] <gaussian88> Jimbo: All *nix systems sees everything as a "file"
[12:19] <gaussian88> Jimbo: sorry if that wasn't ehlpful at all
[12:19] <jsmith88> tnnc: have you tried installing it yet?
[12:19] <gaussian88> Jimbo: er.   helpful
[12:19] <Jordan_U> The gnome power applet thinks I am still connected to my power supply when my laptop is on battery power so when it runsout of battery my computer shuts down from loss of power instead of shutting down correctly.
[12:20] <tnnc> jsmith88,no not yet
[12:21] <bluefox83> is there a way to see exactly how much bandwidth each program you are running is using up?
[12:21] <Keyseir> !ubotu mount
[12:21] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[12:21] <nothlit> andreasdk, im still workiing on ur problem don't worry, but you can try the vlc plugin in the meantime (also extensions also require a restart)
[12:21] <Xaxafrad> is there a simple little command i can spit at a shell to find out what particular shell it is?
[12:21] <jsmith88> tnnc: ok, if you need any more help with it, just yell out
[12:21] <Keyseir> Why is there no System -> Administration -> Disks on Edgy Eft?
[12:21] <nothlit> Xaxafrad, echo $SHELL
[12:21] <K1765> Where can I get themes for ubuntu?
[12:21] <Jordan_U> gnome-look.org
[12:21] <Xaxafrad> thanx
[12:21] <gaussian88> K1765: gnome-look.og
[12:22] <gaussian88> Jordan_U: your quick on the draw
[12:22] <nalioth> !tell K1765 about themes
[12:22] <K1765> Thanks gaussian, I'm beginning to love u :P
[12:22] <mads-> Is there a good command line mp3 player?
[12:22] <K1765> lol
[12:22] <Raffaello> oha
[12:22] <bjorn_> Crimsun: Even with the volume almost turned off in the volume controller it's got background noise. Strange thing is the volume is still in fact pretty high..
[12:22] <bluefox83> Keyseir, good question >.>
[12:23] <bluefox83> i coulda sworn i had it when i installed edgy
[12:23] <Jordan_U> mads-: You can use mplayer from the command line.
[12:23] <gaussian88> bjorn_: check the PCM volume level as well as the master volume level
[12:23] <K1765> While I'm here got another question
[12:23] <Raffaello> Hi everything.  wanna ask something that install to ubuntu? Are there any person to help me?
[12:23] <salim> I might help you, Raffaello
[12:23] <K1765> I try to load a .wmv and it says "loading, buffing" and then it just stops and doesn't play
[12:23] <Keyseir> Does anyone know about "Disks" on edgy?
[12:23] <mariusk> does ubuntu regard the user I created for myself as the 'local administrator'?
[12:24] <gaussian88> K1765: ready?
[12:24] <nalioth> Raffaello: what language do you speak?
[12:24] <gaussian88> K1765: find mplayers homepage and download the essential codec pack
[12:24] <K1765> Ok.
[12:24] <gaussian88> K1765: unpack it, then put all the contents into the folder /usr/lib/win32
[12:24] <gaussian88> K1765: create the win32 folder if you must
[12:25] <Raffaello> Nalioth ; French, English, Turkish, Spanish
[12:25] <Zarephath> I get this when I go to youtube... Hello, you either have JavaScript turned off or an old version of Macromedia's Flash Player. Get the latest flash player.
[12:25] <gaussian88> K1765: you can play virtually anything you can throw at it via totem and/or mplayer
[12:25] <gaussian88> K1765: maybe xine as well
[12:25] <nalioth> Raffaello: ok, we have #ubuntu-es, #ubuntu-fr, and other language channels available if you find one or the other more comfortable to use
[12:25] <Zarephath> I have compiled and installed gnash as well as java 1.5 and 1.4.2 for PPC...I currently have it set to use java 1.5
[12:25] <Jordan_U> Zarephath: And you have flashplayer installed?
[12:25] <gaussian88> Zarephath: use synaptic and that the flash-nonfree version
[12:25] <K1765> Cant find essential codec pack
[12:25] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what's up with the hda modules and getting them into ubuntu?
[12:26] <rodrigo> puta merda qta gente
[12:26] <gaussian88> Zarephath: I don't know the exact name, but it says flash and nonfree in it's name
[12:26] <K1765> Found it lol
[12:26] <rigidus> hi all
[12:26] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: too vague
[12:26] <gaussian88> Zarephath: you may need to put / enable some additional repos (see: www.ubuntuguide.org)
[12:26] <nothlit> flashplugin-nonfree
[12:26] <nalioth> gaussian88: it doesn't work on PowerPC
[12:26] <gaussian88> K1765: good
[12:26] <outRider> is it possibe to install more than 1 version of some software? i.e. a package version and a version build from source
[12:26] <noxxle> tried to install ut2004, didnt work, uninstalled. and now on login i get and error my .dmrc is being ignored because other users shouldnt have access to my home directory. I set permissions on my home to ME only and yet it still keeps saying that on login
[12:26] <gaussian88> nalioth: oh.... Didn't realize we were talking PowerPC
[12:26] <gaussian88> nalioth: sorry
[12:26] <K1765> Take that back, Didn't. Link doesn't work >.<
[12:26] <Zarephath> gaussian88, : Yeah but as I stated this is for PPC not i386...there isn't a flash player other than gnash..well one other but the wiki said this was the better choice
[12:27] <Jordan_U> nalioth: If you are desperate you can try gnash.
[12:27] <Keyseir> !ubotu disks edgy
[12:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about disks edgy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:27] <Keyseir> !ubotu disks
[12:27] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[12:27] <nalioth> Jordan_U: thanks, i was discussing gnash with gaussian88 because Zarephath mentioned it
[12:27] <rigidus> could anybody help me guys? I'm trying to maximize an xfs fs by xfs_growfs, but it's not working at all.
[12:27] <mariusk> K1765, look at where the link is pointing and search for the codec pack via google
[12:27] <nothlit> andreasdk, are you behind any firewall or router? im having difficulties finding the default version of vncserver on ubuntu
[12:27] <rigidus> I was doing this way: xfs_growfs / -d
[12:27] <damg_> are there any mono 1.2 final debs available already?
[12:28] <nothlit> rigidus, i think gparted has support for xfs growing
[12:28] <Zarephath> Hey nalioth: Compile seemed to go fine...as I stated I have installed both ibm java versions as I suppose you may or may not have done...
[12:28] <JosefK> damg_: alas no, fairly trivial to build them into /usr/local from source though
[12:28] <nalioth> Zarephath: excellent to hear :)
[12:28] <rigidus> nothlit: is it on knoppix?
[12:29] <nothlit> nalioth, if i install the 4 dev libraries it wants me to install 39 dependencies
[12:29] <damg_> JosefK: thanks, I'll try to build a deb then (:
[12:29] <Zarephath> nalioth: The part that perturbs me is it is stating javascript... is there something I missed that I need to enable to get javascript up and running too?
[12:29] <rigidus> nothlit (this one is a server)
[12:29] <K1765> Where do I put the themes I downloaded so they will work?
[12:29] <nothlit> rigidus, no but its on ubuntu, also you can download the gparted live cd, its also on the ubuntu install disk and kanotix
[12:29] <Zarephath> nalioth: Are you able to go to youtube and play a video?
[12:29] <JosefK> damg_: well, you can build a deb if you're adventurous, I just meant compiling the latest mono into /usr/local though :)
[12:30] <gaussian88> K1765: System --> Prefs --> Themes
[12:30] <gaussian88> K1765: you'll see it
[12:30] <K1765> ty
[12:30] <nalioth> Zarephath: your browser should support javascript
[12:30] <gaussian88> K1765: you really should look at www.ubuntuguide.org
[12:30] <nalioth> nothlit: well, that is the fun part of building your own software, the libs required
[12:30] <Zarephath> nalioth, : Yeah that was what I thought too...firefox 2 included in edgy
[12:30] <mads-> Jordan_U: which package does it come with?
[12:30] <rigidus> nothlit: thanks a lot, i try that one :-)
[12:30] <nalioth> Zarephath: i don't do audio/video on this box  :|
[12:31] <nothlit> rigidus, the gparted livecd is small ez to download its about 30mb and runs xfce, not much on it kanotix is a lot more useful in whole but full size
[12:31] <nothlit> rigidus, gparted is only on the ubuntu live cd
[12:31] <loboson> well, it's nice: a new piece of version to test and enhance
[12:31] <nothlit> Zarephath, beta 2 is included in edgy
[12:31] <Jordan_U> mads-: mplayer
[12:31] <loboson> but I can't still use all my hardware :-S
[12:32] <K1765> lol its quicker here :P
[12:32] <Zarephath> nalioth, : Ok thanks...I just checked and enable javascript is checked in prefs...
[12:32] <Zarephath> nothlit, : Ok thank you
[12:32] <mads-> Jordan_U: apt-get install mplayer?
[12:32] <Jordan_U> mads-: sudo apt-get install mplayer
[12:32] <nothlit> does anyone know what vncserver the gnome desktop calls? i can't find any server in /usr/bin
[12:32] <Jordan_U> mads-: yes.
[12:32] <loboson> I think that's the problem...
[12:32] <seb--> Why does Ubuntu seem do wifi better than Debian? Is it because they spend more time testing? why? more $$$ available?
[12:32] <mads-> doesn't work :(
[12:32] <nalioth> Zarephath: please keep in mind, gnash is still very much an in-development project
[12:33] <Eleaf> Paladine, pally pally.
[12:33] <nothlit> seb--, ubuntu focuses more on getting everything up and going more easily, and that includes hardware
[12:33] <Jordan_U> Zarephath: Last I checked gnash couldn't play youtube vids.
[12:33] <gaussian88> seb--: I think it has more to do with gnome and gnome customization
[12:33] <loboson> yes, some probs with hardware
[12:33] <seb--> nothlit: you mean more *polish*?
[12:33] <Zarephath> nalioth, : Yes sir..I do know that...I can understand it not working..however I would have assumed I would be able to see something occur..heh
[12:33] <Fletcheri> anyone know much about realplayer 10? im trying to use it but its acting really jumpy with stream files atm
[12:33] <Keyseir> Does anyone know how I can mount a secondary HD on edgy?
[12:33] <gaussian88> seb--: ie., they just made it easier to properly config. the hardware for a wider range of hardware
[12:33] <nothlit> seb--, no, ubuntu adds things and makes custom tools
[12:33] <nalioth> !tell Keyseir about mount
[12:33] <Zarephath> Jordan_U, : Kewl that helps...what can you tell me about their format they stream?
[12:33] <Mantice> How do I restore my system tray ? I think I deleted it.
[12:34] <K1765> One more question
[12:34] <seb--> gaussian: the fact is debian can be 'rough around the edges.....ubuntu is more like os X
[12:34] <jcrochford> Fletcher, what problems are you having?
[12:34] <gaussian88> nothlit: really?  that's great!
[12:34] <crimsun> Fletcheri: the version in dapper-commercial?
[12:34] <nothlit> seb--, ubuntu isn't more polished than debian, just differing philosophies
[12:34] <K1765> How do i login as admin to paste something in user/lib/win32
[12:34] <rigidus> nothlit: thanks again :-)
[12:34] <jrib> Mantice: right click on your panel and add the "notification area"
[12:34] <nalioth> !tell K1765 about sudo
[12:34] <Keyseir> nalioth: "Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks" this doesn't exist on edgy
[12:34] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: did you feel like elaborating, or were you going to leave the question as vague?
[12:34] <nothlit> does anyone know what vncserver the gnome desktop calls? i can't find any server in /usr/bin
[12:34] <seb--> nothlit: but *why* / *how* did they get wifi to work better?
[12:34] <gaussian88> K1765: cd into the directory where the files are
[12:34] <Fletcheri> jcrochford: when i stream form a video link it palys a few seconds, pauses the prgo and then palys again ect...
[12:34] <bjorn_> Crimsun: Thank you. Now I at least have some sound. It's still noisy after toggling with the volumes though, but I can live with that for a while. Funny thing now is Skype won't connect my calls. Saying I got a problem with sound device
[12:34] <nothlit> Keyseir, what are you trying to do?
[12:35] <nalioth> Keyseir: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[12:35] <Jordan_U> Zarephath: I havn't had my PPC machine for a while but I remember being able to use a page to get the .flv from youtube and play it in ffmpeg.
[12:35] <loboson> It won't work ok with my pda
[12:35] <gaussian88> K1765: then sudo mkdir /usr/lib/win32;sudo cp * /usr/lib/win32/
[12:35] <seb--> nothlit: does the founder burn few millions for a room full of testers to polish it better?
[12:35] <nothlit> seb--, hardware detection configuration utilites and regular configuration utilities i would assume
[12:35] <jcrochford> Fletcher: Does it have anything to do with your bandwidth?  My first thought is that RP10 is working fine.
[12:35] <Keyseir> nothlit, I just did a fresh edgy installation and I have a USB external HD I want to connect. I need to mount this external HD.
[12:35] <crimsun> bjorn_: close all audio apps before using skype
[12:35] <Zarephath> Jordan_U, : Ok I will look into that then..just find the stream and use ffmpeg..maybe..heh
[12:35] <loboson> don't know why
[12:35] <seb--> nothlit: it must have cost big $$$ for ubuntu to improve autodetection
[12:35] <nothlit> seb--, i think most of the development it still volunteered
[12:35] <loboson> well, it's a WM5
[12:35] <Fletcheri> jcrochford: my bandwith is good, im on a 10mb line, it shouldn't make any difference
[12:35] <loboson> syncCE doesn't work well
[12:36] <Keyseir> nothlit I was used to System -> disks and that doesn't seem to exist on edgy
[12:36] <fugitive_> if i want to make a command 'install x' to do apt-get install x where x is whatever I say - how would i do it
[12:36] <nothlit> Keyseir, did you plug it in? ubuntu should automount external disks
[12:36] <seb--> nothlit: making debian better isn't a trivial achivement :)
[12:36] <fugitive_> what is the script
[12:36] <Jordan_U> Zarephath: I think it was keepvid ( the site, google it )
[12:36] <nalioth> fugitive_: make an alias
[12:36] <fugitive_> nalioth: how ?
[12:36] <safejav> hi
[12:36] <Keyseir> nothlit, Yes, it's plugged in and the status lights are fine
[12:37] <nothlit> seb--, debian isn't supposed to be easy to install, but they stick with what they do and other distros can feel free to add and improve, besides, look at mepis or livecds
[12:37] <Keyseir> nothlit, if it was automounted where would I find it?
[12:37] <nalioth> fugitive_: ask uncle google "bash aliases" or "bash alias"
[12:37] <Jordan_U> !hi | safejav
[12:37] <ubotu> safejav: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:37] <nalioth> fugitive_: be beware, aliases are quite addictive
[12:37] <bjorn_> Crimsun: Still trouble
[12:37] <gaussian88> nothlit: look in /media
[12:37] <gaussian88> sorry
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[12:37] <Poromenos> how can i use WPA with ubuntu server?
[12:37] <seb--> nothlit: is ubuntu good for debian? how to debianites feel about it?
[12:37] <nothlit> Keyseir, did you check /media? it should automatically show on the desktop and other places.. is the account you're logged into the first account created?
[12:37] <gaussian88> Keyseir: look in /media
[12:37] <seb--> nothlit: is ubuntu a 'win-win' for both?
[12:37] <loboson> syncCE doesn't work well with my WM5 PDA
[12:38] <jcrochford> Fletcher, No specific server problems?  Is there a particular site from which you're streaming the video?  I have to confess I'm an Ubuntu noob, but I've got no problems with RP10 that I've detected yet.
[12:38] <nothlit> seb--, its mostly a win win, both projects contribute to each other but there is the fear that people will stop developing for debian first from what i've read, and only make packages for ubuntu
[12:38] <Keyseir> nothlit, definitely not on the desktop. Yes, I'm using the first account.
[12:38] <Keyseir> nothlit, I had the ext hd d/cd when i installed, but I've rebooted sense too...
[12:38] <nothlit> Keyseir, check places and computer
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[12:38] <loboson> does anybody know why syncCE doesn't work well with my WM5 PDA??
[12:39] <crimsun> bjorn_: well, unless you can give me debug messages for arecord, I can't help you diagnose alsa capture
[12:39] <nothlit> Keyseir, try unplugging and replugging, i don't know how  well ubuntu does with coldplugging
[12:39] <Keyseir> nothlit, nope
[12:39] <Keyseir> nothlit, not under media either
[12:39] <gaussian88> Keyseir: is this a usb device?
[12:39] <shwag> ~/.bash_profile says "the default umask is set in /etc/login.defs" , but I changed the the UMASK setting in login.defs, and  $ umask , still says 022
[12:39] <nothlit> Keyseir, ok because accounts made later may not have the permission for external disks enabled
[12:39] <Versed> I made a mistake an downloaded the desktop iso, can I install ubuntu onto my G4 with this cd iso?  And yes I downloaded the PPC version.
[12:39] <nothlit> Keyseir, try unplugging and replugging, i don't know how  well ubuntu does with coldplugging
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[12:39] <Keyseir> gaussian88, yes
[12:39] <infidel> ok i got the latest ati driver to install all right but i hav to load the modules by hand and then restart x is there a way to add this to start at boot/
[12:39] <gaussian88> Keyseir: do 'lsusb'
[12:40] <gaussian88> Keyseir: is it listed?
[12:40] <Jordan_U> Versed: How much ram?
[12:40] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I feel like being vauge... The newest alsa packages I mean, do you know if 1.0.13 is going to get into ubuntu edgy?
[12:40] <jrib> Versed: the desktop cd is both the live cd and the install cd
[12:40] <Versed> thanks jrib.
[12:40] <Versed> I have plenty, like a gig and 200 gig hd.  not a problem.
[12:40] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: it's already in edgy.
[12:40] <GayNigra> Ubuntu will be fucked up again tonight :D
[12:40] <Keyseir> gaussian88, I'm not sure.
[12:40] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: really?
[12:40] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: at least my portion of it is
[12:40] <gaussian88> Keyseir: is anything listed?
[12:40] <GayNigra> Ubuntu will be fucked up again tonight :D
[12:40] -GayNigra:#ubuntu- Ubuntu will be fucked up again tonight :D

[12:41] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: you'll have to manually apply my queue, but yes, it all there. See kernel-team@
[12:41] <pianoboy3333> !info alsa-driver

[12:41] <pianoboy3333> !info alsa-drivers

[12:41] <Amaranth> ack, lag
[12:41] <theCore> nalioth, expoit -> ufngcaieoew
[12:41] <crimsun> alsa-driver is the source package name.
[12:41] <pianoboy3333> oh
[12:41] <rob> theCore: got him
[12:42] <theCore> thanks
[12:42] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: alsa-base is 10.0.11
[12:42] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: so?
[12:42] <nothlit> jrib, yeah but the live cd is weak as an install cd
[12:42] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: the available hda via kernel-team is post-1.0.13
[12:42] <crimsun> alsa-base is scripts and modprobe.d/blacklist files
[12:42] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what's kernel-team? Is it a repository?
[12:43] <crimsun> it's a mailing list
[12:43] <pianoboy3333> oh
[12:43] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so are there debs of a newer version of the driver with snd-hda-intel ?
[12:43] <pianoboy3333> what are you saying?
[12:43] <[sYn] > Does anyone know where the Beryl settings for changing the screen hot zones are? (the areas that cause all of the windows to move onto the screen for task management..)
[12:43] <crimsun> the patches you need to apply to linux-source-2.6.17 are available on kernel-team@
[12:44] <pianoboy3333> oh
[12:44] <CVirus> Suddenly my swap isnt activated on boot ... I hate to swapon each time I start my laptop .. whats wrong ?
[12:44] <nothlit> [sYn] , that is under scale, last ta
[12:44] <nothlit> [sYn] , tab
[12:44] <CVirus> have*
[12:44] <[sYn] > nothlit, thanks :)
[12:45] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I have to apply patches? will I have to configure the kernel, or just apply the patches and run, I have had experience with building a kernel... unsuccesful wifi support, but w/e
[12:45] <pianoboy3333> s/run/compile/
[12:45] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: if you want nice debs of alsa-modules, just grab upstream's alsa-driver-1.0.13 and generate them using module-assistant
[12:46] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: my patches are for our git repos, not for the end user
[12:46] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: oh, I see, so where can I learn about making debs with m-a?
[12:46] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: the README.Debian shipped with alsa-source
[12:46] <pianoboy3333> ok
[12:46] <nalioth> ATTENTION PLEASE, if you are getting "cannot send to channel", please register your nick or identify if you are registered.  /msg nickserv help register
[12:46] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so what should I download off of alsa-project.org?
[12:47] <crimsun> alsa-driver-1.0.13
[12:47] <pianoboy3333> ok
[12:47] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: will I need the newest libasound for that?
[12:48] <crimsun> alsa-lib has nothing to do with it.
[12:48] <pianoboy3333> oh, ok
[12:48] <rogue78> has anyone had a a/v sync problem with videos in edgy eft?
[12:48] <Jordan_U> nalioth: Why, is it a glitch or is there a spam problem?
[12:48] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: ok, so unpackage the source, and look at the README.debian in debian/ ?
[12:49] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: no, there's a README.Debian in alsa-source (binary package)
[12:49] <nalioth> Jordan_U: spam. further discussion in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[12:49] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: wait... you said to download alsa-driver
[12:49] <pianoboy3333> do you want me to apt-get source alsa-source?
[12:50] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: I meant what I typed. Download alsa-driver from upstream; consult the documentation from alsa-source.
[12:50] <crimsun> if you want to be lazy, grab Debian Sid's alsa-source
[12:50] <pianoboy3333> and just change the changelog, and run a debuild?
[12:51] <crimsun> which method are you using?
[12:51] <rogue78> has anyone had problems with flash being out of sync with audio? the video is behind the audio for me
[12:51] <rogue78> I just installed edgy
[12:51] <crimsun> rogue78: remove flashplugin-nonfree and use the flash 9 beta
[12:51] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I'm not sure.... so I can download alsa-driver from upstream, and just compile that, or get debian sid's and debuild that...?
[12:52] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: do you want a short answer or a long answer?
[12:52] <rogue78> crimsum: thanks
[12:52] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: but what is alsa-source? just a package in the repos?
[12:52] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I'm just very confused that's all, knowing what alsa-source is may clear things up
[12:52] <hyperactivecrond> does anybody know how to take the output from jack and pipe it to the stdin of another program>?
[12:52] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: I understand alsa-driver is the driver
=== SportChick is now known as LagChick
[12:53] <hyperactivecrond> for example to lame?
[12:53] <nalioth> !tell CoolCubix about guidelines
[12:53] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: I use "alsa-driver" to refer to the name of the Debian/Ubuntu source package that generates the alsa-base, linux-sound-base, and alsa-source binary packages. I use "alsa-driver-1.0.13" when referring to upstream (ftp.alsa-project.org) alsa-driver tarball.
[12:53] <pianoboy3333> right
[12:54] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: but mostly, the easiest thing may be just getting alsa-driver from debian sid, so I'll go with that
[12:54] <CoolCubix> nalioth> sorry, didn't know about that
[12:54] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: you mean alsa-source
[12:54] <CoolCubix> it's an information rather for another channel
[12:54] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: sure
[12:55] <treat> I can't get my Quickcam pro 3000 working in edgy =(
[12:55] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so just compile the alsa-source package? or that has to be added to my kernel in some way
[12:56] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: read /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian
[12:56] <pianoboy3333> ok
[12:57] <mztriz> I just installed edgy on my laptop, but I'm not getting an internet connection.... any ideas?
[12:57] <Garrett> For some reason, when I go to boot from the Live CD, the splash screen comes up. I select 'Install or Run Ubuntu' and it says 'Loading Kernel' and such. Then, it goes to a screen with a blinking underscore. It stayed like that for 20 minutes. I noticed that it wasn't reading the CD-ROM drive. The same thing happens when I go to check the CD contents.
[12:57] <rogue78> crimsum: I downloaded the flash 9 beta and untarballed it. now what?
[12:57] <crimsun> rogue78: put the lib in ~/.mozilla/plugins/
[12:57] <rogue78> crimsum: libflashplayer.so ?
[12:57] <crimsun> rogue78: make sure you remove the flashplugin-nonfree package, then restart ff
[12:58] <crimsun> yes
[12:58] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: wait... but the .orig.tar.gz of alsa-source _is_ alsa-driver
[12:58] <nalioth> Garrett: did you check the checksums to make sure you have a proper image/disk?
[12:58] <abo> in windows, I used to use a web spider like application, called Teleport Pro, is there any similar one in ubuntu?
[12:58] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: alsa-source is a binary package. It contains a stripped orig.tar.gz of alsa-driver-1.0.13.
[12:59] <Garrett> nalioth: You mean did I select the option for that on the boot screen?
[12:59] <pianoboy3333> right
[12:59] <nothlit> Garrett, you can switch to a virtual terminal with ctrl+alt+f1 and then less /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see what went wrong or use the alternate install cd or use the second boot option, because it sounds like xorg fails to initialise
[12:59] <rogue78> crimsun: when I try to play flash in mozilla, it's saying flash ain't installed.
[12:59] <crimsun> now use module-assistant with alsa-source
[12:59] <nalioth> !tell Garrett about verify
[12:59] <crimsun> rogue78: well, did you move the plugin to the correct location?
[01:00] <mayhem-> hi. I'm new to linux I'm a bit confused on which ubuntu to get.  6.10 is the latest version but only for 6.06 it says that it's supported for 3 years. does this mean 6.10 isn't?  also I suppose 6.06 is probably more stable?
[01:00] <rogue78> ~/.mozilla/plugins
[01:00] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: but how do I get the source of it... I don't have it installed on my system at all, I'm sorry, I know I sound difficult, just install it, or download sid's deb?
[01:00] <crimsun> argh.
[01:00] <rogue78> crimsun: sudo cp flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.55/libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins
[01:00] <nalioth> mayhem-: 6.10 is supported with security updates for 18 months
[01:00] <mztriz> Could anyone help me get my wifi working on my laptop?
[01:00] <Garrett> nothlit: Alternate install CD?
[01:00] <crimsun> rogue78: don't use sudo
[01:00] <rogue78> oh crap
[01:00] <rogue78> duh
[01:00] <rogue78> punches self in face
[01:00] <Garrett> nothlit:  And, err, second boot option?
[01:01] <nothlit> Garrett, yeah theres a second install cd that doesn't use a point and click gui, (but it does use the ncurses gui)
[01:01] <Garrett> nothlit: Point and click..You could use a mouse in that? O.o
[01:01] <nalioth> Garrett: ubotu sent you some info in a PM
[01:01] <nothlit> Garrett, yes when you boot the cd theres a variety of options like boot or install , boot legacy or compatibility mode, check disk, and boot from first hard disk
[01:01] <tag> how do I snag a list of my installed packages?
[01:01] <crimsun> this cannot be this difficult.
[01:02] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/a/alsa-driver/alsa-source_1.0.13-1ubuntu1_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i alsa-source_1.0.13-1ubuntu1_all.deb
[01:02] <tag> just the package names, so I can re-install all of the software I need after I reinstall dapper
[01:02] <tag> ?
[01:02] <nothlit> Garrett, yes, most live cds use point and click interfaces
[01:02] <worldplay_RapidF> anyone know why i get a X server problem when trying to install Ubuntu?
[01:02] <Garrett> nothlit: Okay, so what's the best thing to do in my current situation?
[01:03] <infidel> can someone help me with this, i have the working fglrx driver but it won't load when x loads i have to load it like this sudo insmod /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/misc/fglrx.ko then restart X any ideals? i tried sticking it in /etc/modules
[01:03] <caffiend> I have burn't 3 cd's with ubuntu server 6.1 and they all test bad.  I have even burned at 2x!  Is there a way to check the iso?
[01:03] <rogue78> crimsun: cp: accessing `/home/shawn/.mozilla/plugins/': Not a directory
[01:03] <crimsun> rogue78: so create it.
[01:03] <whyvas> caffiend, check the md5 sum
[01:04] <nothlit> Garrett, reboot and choose the second option and see if that works, if not go and download the alternate cd and use that to install instead
[01:04] <whyvas> caffiend, you probably have a case of shitty cheap cd's though
[01:04] <worldplay_RapidF> so no ones can help me?
[01:04] <whyvas> worldplay_RapidF, no
[01:04] <worldplay_RapidF> what!?
[01:04] <rogue78> crimsun:mkdir: cannot create directory `/home/shawn/.mozilla/plugins/': File exists
[01:04] <Garrett> nothlit: The second option is verify the CD, right? I said that that had given me the same error.
[01:04] <rogue78> crimsun: mkdir: cannot create directory `/home/shawn/.mozilla/plugins/': File exists
[01:05] <rogue78> crimsun: and when I browse there with gnome, there is a plugins file with a padlock icon on it
[01:05] <nothlit> nothlit, no the second option should be some sort of legacy/compatibility mode
[01:05] <nothlit> Garrett, wait, the verification freezes too?

[01:07] <njal> ah

[01:08] <Zambezi> Anyone know what kcryptd/0 is? The CPU-load on kcryptd/0 is over 50%!
[01:08] <Jordan_U> worldplay_RapidF: Are you at a terminal prompt?
[01:08] <Jordan_U> worldplay_RapidF: Or at a blue screen with strange characters around the edges?

[01:08] <mayhem-> i have core 2 duo CPU, should I get 64 or 32 bit version?
[01:08] <shawarma> Zambezi: Do you by any chance have an encrypted partition?
[01:08] <worldplay_RapidF> then 1st
[01:08] <preaction> Zambezi, that's probably the kernel crypt daemon. are you doing anything with hashing?
[01:08] <worldplay_RapidF> 64
[01:08] <worldplay_RapidF> ?
[01:08] <Merkidemis> Could someone assist me with getting my latop's ATI graphics card running right?  I can get into xwindows fine, but the redraw is really, really slow
[01:09] <laervian> anybody knows for swap partition?
[01:09] <Merkidemis> its an ATI Mobility X200
[01:09] <lupine_85> depends on whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit CPU
[01:09] <ansivirus> i'm having a problem with artwiz fonts package on 6.10
[01:09] <rogue78> crimsun: I still can't copy to it, or make the directory
[01:09] <lupine_85> e.g. Opterons are 64-bit
[01:09] <whyvas> caffiend, i have blue hp's that work great
[01:09] <Zambezi> shawarma, I have.
[01:09] <rogue78> crimsun: sorry if I'm being annoying, but I'm a total noob for linux
[01:09] <Merkidemis> I have tried reinstalling fglrx, but it doesn't work
[01:09] <Jordan_U> worldplay_RapidF: Ok, try running: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and choose vesa when asked what driver to use.
[01:09] <crimsun> rogue78: did you chown ~/.mozilla/plugins/ ?
[01:09] <Zambezi> preaction, Yes.
[01:10] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, do you have Option "NoAccel" "true" in your xorg.conf file?
[01:10] <preaction> Zambezi, sounds like the culprit
[01:10] <caffiend> whyvas: are the silver in the top left and blue on the bottom and right side?
[01:10] <rogue78> yes
[01:10] <eetfunk> how do i obtain the version #/name of ubuntu from the command line?
[01:10] <rogue78> crimsun: yes and the padlock icon went away, but it is still a file, not a folder
[01:10] <ansivirus> eetfunk, uname -a  ??
[01:10] <apokryphos> eeboy: cat /etc/version
[01:11] <njal> how do i reconfigure my X server to probe a new monitor while saving the XGL options i added?
[01:11] <eetfunk> thanks!
[01:11] <caffiend> whyvas: I have the iso on my old P3 1Ghz linux box, is it possible to put it onto a usb drive to install? I have a 512 oe 2g that will work
[01:11] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: no, but I do have composite set to disabled, as on the forums people said that could be an option
[01:11] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: problem, not option
[01:11] <crimsun> rogue78: rm ~/.mozilla/plugins && mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
[01:11] <eetfunk> ansivirus: this only gives me the kernel version.
=== battlesquid is now known as battlesquid_
[01:11] <ansivirus> eetfunk, yeah sorry cat /etc/version
[01:11] <Zambezi> preaction, It's soon down. But I might change computer from P2 to P3. That should decrese the load.
[01:12] <eetfunk> ansivirus: i don't have a /etc/version file
[01:12] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: It was working fine under Dapper, but got messed up when I dist-upgraded to Edgy
[01:12] <nothlit> njal, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is way too invasive for that, and i think it only supports one monitor, have you tried your video driver utility?
[01:12] <preaction> Zambezi, well, hashing (and any cryptography) is very processor intensive. you should anticipate high loads when you're doing it
[01:12] <nothlit> crimsun, dont you mean rm -fr?
[01:12] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, I also have composite disabled and for 2D my card works pretty fast. I know it works slow in my case if I disable acceleration... but in your case the problem seems to be another issue
[01:12] <whyvas> caffiend, maybe but i don't know how
[01:12] <crimsun> nothlit: not necessary in this context
[01:13] <Zambezi> preaction, Then I give it a shot until the hashing is done.
[01:13] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, edgy messed a lot of things... fonts in gnome, xservers, etc. :(
[01:13] <nothlit> crimsun, then wouldn't rmdir would just as well?
[01:13] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: Yeah, and I've been pouring over the forums for days trying to get it working.
[01:13] <caffiend> would simple extraction of the ISO to a USB drive work?
[01:13] <rogue78> crimsun: thanks a lot man, it works great now!
[01:13] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: is there an "easy" way to get back to dapper?
[01:13] <crimsun> nothlit: read his statement carefully. He created a file instead of a directory.
[01:13] <LjL> !downgrade | Merkidemis
[01:13] <ubotu> Merkidemis: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[01:13] <nothlit> crimsun, oh i was just scanning sry
[01:13] <nalioth> nothlit: rmdir only works on empty directories
[01:14] <Merkidemis> ubotu: well, upgrading broke my system, so...
[01:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about well, upgrading broke my system, so... - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:14] <caffiend> ANyone know if I can extract an ISO to a USB drive and install from that?  My CD drive isn't liking 6.10
[01:14] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, I don't know probably not easier as reinstalling from scratch everything and install your backup (if any)
[01:14] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, but probably your problem has a solution.
[01:14] <rogue78> can someone reccomend a good e-mail client that has good anti-spam ability?
[01:14] <whyvas> caffiend, i don't think it would boot
[01:14] <laervian> anybody knows about how to mount an umnounted swap partition?
[01:14] <whyvas> but maybe
=== battlesquid_ is now known as battlesquid
[01:14] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: Possible.  I'm not looking forward to fighting with my wi-fi again.  That was a simular nightmare
[01:15] <therealbigusdick> in my case without 2D acceleration when I did a ls on a directory with many many files, the slowdown was remarkable
[01:15] <caffiend> I guess is can't hurt
[01:15] <nalioth> rogue78: thunderbird
[01:15] <ansivirus> can someone help with artwiz fonts on edgy?
[01:15] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, well I am really dissapointed with that edgy release, I expected more from ubuntu, really. Just a small rant :)
[01:15] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: thank you
[01:16] <caffiend> sorrt
[01:16] <caffiend> sorry, mouse slipped
[01:16] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: heh, yeah.  I remember my other attempts at Debian all getting messed up when updating.
[01:16] <__mikem> nalioth sorry about the autorejoin, I forgot I had it turned on
[01:16] <mumbles-potpal> can i have some opitions here ? http://pastebin.ca/245444 is that a buggered hdd ?
[01:16] <nalioth> therealbigusdick: edgy was rolled up in a very short amount of time, compared to previous ubuntu releases
[01:16] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: Is there a way to purge all the ATI stuff from the system, go back to VESA, and try installing an older driver?
[01:16] <rogue78> afk
[01:16] <therealbigusdick> nalioth, yes, I know that, but that should not be a excuse to ship with so many regressions...
[01:17] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, well now that xorg is modularized it should be easy, I mean just uninstall all packages with dpkg -l | grep ati, but this can be dangerous too
[01:18] <BlueParrot> could I ask if there is any page with recomended system specs or something along those lines?
[01:18] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: right, but if the worst that happens is I reinstall dapper again, then its no big loss and a learning experience
[01:19] <ansivirus> I'm having problems with artwiz fonts on edgy... i've searched forums but nothing i've found there seems to get me to be able to use the fonts
[01:19] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, if you have your /home or your important files in another partition it should not be any problem too. OTOH in my case the fglrx drivers from ati were also crap and freezed my machine
[01:20] <laervian> anybody knows hot mount a swap partition?
[01:20] <user-land> is it normal that a port i am forwarding only shows up as open when a service is running on it ? http://checksum.org/cso/checkport/
[01:21] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: is there another driver I should try?  (Backups are easy, I have a 1.27TB server for that)
[01:21] <ansivirus> laervian, the command to mount swap is swapon /dev/hda2 (replacing /dev/hda2 with your swap partition)
[01:21] <therealbigusdick> Merkidemis, I've never tried with anything different than ati or fglrx on this machine... so I am not really sure. you could try vesa
=== battlesquid is now known as battlesquid_
[01:22] <ansivirus> any help on font prob?
[01:22] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: well, I think al I have tried is the one I downloaded from ATI.  Is there a second one?
[01:22] <Chippy> hey, is there any way to manually disable sound cards?
[01:22] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: the readme.debian says cd into the root of the headers or source tree that I have prepared and run make-kpkg, but should that be /usr/src/linux-headers-vers/ or /usr/src/linux-headers-vers-generic/ vers being 2.6.17-10
[01:23] <crimsun> don't use make-kpkg
[01:23] <crimsun> use module-assistant
[01:23] <therealbigusdick> I don't think so just fglrx (the propietary drivers) and ati (the free ones)
[01:23] <Merkidemis> therealbigusdick: well, let me try the free ati ones
[01:23] <__mikem> yuck ati
[01:23] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: that's not in that readme, what would you do?
[01:24] <crimsun> use module-assistant
[01:24] <Merkidemis> mikem: yeah, well, its not like i can rip the chip out

[01:39] <ansivirus> livingdaylight, when you type :q! is it showing up in file or at bottom of vi screen?
[01:40] <prestosd> Can anyone help me with graphics driver problems??
[01:40] <Drace> Ahh. Navigating vi for the first time. I remember the horror. :(
[01:40] <tag> dpkg -l | awk '/^ii/ { print $2 }'
[01:40] <tag> yaay
[01:40] <JohnM555> Also, When trying to set the key for my interface, I get 'Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : SET failed on device eth2 : Unknown error 524', why is this happening, or how can I get more information on this error.
[01:40] <ansivirus> livingdaylight, should show up at bottom of the screen... that means escape worked... and the :q! followed by enter will exit without saving
[01:40] <tag> hurm
[01:40] <JohnM555> When I googled this, most people that got the 8B2A error didn't have the Unknown Error 524 part
[01:40] <ansivirus> Drace, yeah tell me about it :P it was a horror :P
[01:41] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so, now that I have those installed, do I need alsa-driver too? or that'll do it
[01:41] <tag> viol
[01:41] <prestosd> I said! Can anyone help me with a graphics driver problem?!
[01:41] <ansivirus> livingdaylight, try gedit freemind.xml if you don't like vi :) that should bring up a  gui
[01:41] <tag> looks like it worked
[01:41] <crimsun> pianoboy3333: have you ignored the past hour or so? :-)
[01:41] <livingdaylight> ansivirus, lol, yes please
[01:41] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: well, I got confused in the middle, and stopped for dinner the past 30 min
[01:41] <Keyseir_> I accidently chownd root. Is there a way to put things back to me not owning everything?
[01:41] <ansivirus> livingdaylight, yeah just run gedit
[01:41] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: don't be so impatient, shoot
[01:42] <prestosd> shoot?
[01:42] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: shoot = shoot your question... like go
[01:42] <livingdaylight> ansivirus, still haven't escaped
[01:42] <Seeker2599> how do i format my flash drive? i cant seem to figure it out
[01:42] <prestosd> oh yah, lol
[01:42] <Flamekebab> any ideas how to fix a GRUB error 17
[01:42] <Keyseir_> !setuid
[01:42] <ansivirus> livingdaylight, open another terminal window and run killall vi
[01:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about setuid - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:42] <pianoboy3333> Seeker2599: install gparted
[01:42] <prestosd> I used to be able to play 3d games in ubuntu 6.10
[01:42] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: what distro are you using....?
[01:42] <prestosd> but it was an upgraded version from 6.06 LTS Christian edition
[01:42] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: ok
[01:43] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: and now...?
[01:43] <prestosd> i cant
[01:43] <lullabud> prestosd:  Christian edition?
[01:43] <prestosd> i reinstalled a clean version of ubuntu 6.10
[01:43] <prestosd> non upgrade
[01:43] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: what gfx card do you have?
[01:43] <prestosd> and now when I click on a 3d game it stalls then says that the app quit
[01:43] <Flamekebab> any ideas how to fix a GRUB error 17?
[01:43] <K1765> How do I find out the process, Frostwire is. It will not close on its own so im trying to kill from terminal
[01:43] <rogue78> is there any software for ubuntu like dragon naturally speaking?
[01:43] <swaby1> hi how can I get my wireless card working if I install xubuntu on my laptop
[01:43] <pianoboy3333> Flamekebab: try #grub?
[01:44] <prestosd> I have a NVIDIA Riva TNT (16MB)
[01:44] <Flamekebab> thanks, pianoboy3333
[01:44] <livingdaylight> ansivirus, now gedit was easy and quick
[01:44] <swaby1> its a cheap truck stop wireless card
[01:44] <pianoboy3333> Flamekebab: not to deter you, just #grub -- if there is one -- may give you the best supporrt
[01:44] <prestosd> my drivers are the nvidia-glx-legacy
[01:44] <K1765> How do I find out the process, Frostwire is. It will not close on its own so im trying to kill from terminal
[01:44] <Drace> livingdaylight: don't feel bad. I don't like vi, either.
[01:44] <rogue78> is there any software for ubuntu like dragon naturally speaking? even a no would be an answer.
[01:44] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: so I'm guessing m-a was an alternative to the drivers package
[01:45] <livingdaylight> Drace, just a matter of knowing and getting used agues, but gedit sure seems simpler if one is adding a simple script to a file
[01:45] <scubes13> hi all - looking for some guidance on getting an atheros wlan nic working under fresh install of edgy (currently displays as "ath0" under ifconfig, but cant scan for a network nor get any connection)
[01:45] <prestosd> pianoboy3333: my card is a NVIDIA Riva TNT and my drivers are nvidia-glx-legacy
[01:45] <Jordan_U> K1765: ps aux | grep frostwire may tell you.
[01:45] <rogue78> crimsun: do you know of any speech recognition software for linux?
[01:46] <therealbigusdick> ESC :q! :e A ESC uggh I can stand vi :)
[01:46] <swaby1> also if I instal xubuntu desktop can I switch between gnome and xubuntu
[01:46] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: I'm not sure... sorry, I'm not good with nvidia cards
[01:46] <therealbigusdick> I cannot stand
[01:46] <prestosd> drat
[01:46] <pianoboy3333> therealbigusdick: so use pico or nano
[01:46] <prestosd> pianoboy3333: know anyone that is?
[01:46] <MarcN> swaby1: yes.
[01:46] <wildchild> can someone pastebin the path of config file of firefox please?
[01:46] <therealbigusdick> ok
[01:47] <pianoboy3333> prestosd: yes.... but not in right now, and that would be wanting to help, sorry
[01:47] <swaby1> does it hurt anything and will I still have the same programs
[01:47] <prestosd> pianoboy3333: k, ttyl
[01:47] <livingdaylight> sudo /usr/bin/update-menus   : command not found. Anyone know the correct command for updating menu?
[01:47] <MarcN> swaby1: not a problem, just additional programs are available.  You can run gnome apps from the xubuntu desktop.   Same with KDE apps
[01:48] <Zehrila> I have a question. If I download and install the latest Ubuntu Home Edition and then install KDE over it, would that make the system identical to Kubuntu (not considering the extra Gnome, ofcourse)?
[01:48] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: what are the binary package names for the source package alsa-library
[01:48] <case1> Hey ya'll, i was wondering if anybody knew how to setup a VNC repeater on a ubuntu server? I want to make use UltraVNC SC to allow my friends and family to go to my website, download the app and then I can connect from anywhere to their system using VNC so I can help them with helpdesk kinda stuff... anybody in here have any ideas or where to go or how to do that?
=== strlen_ is now known as strlen
[01:48] <tonyyarusso> swaby1: You'll have both sets of programs; some are the same between Gnome and XFCE, some aren't (by default), but you can use programs for either on either.
[01:48] <MarcN> Zehrila: it should be the same.  Can't think of any differences.
[01:48] <Zehrila> MarcN: Thanks a lot. =] 
[01:49] <Jordan_U> Zehrila: No, if you install kubuntu-desktop it would but your menus would be cluttered with both gnome and kde apps
[01:49] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: seems I have to compile those
[01:49] <nalioth> Zehrila: you can have ubuntu- and kubuntu- and xubunt-desktop all installed at once with no ill effects
[01:49] <Zehrila> Jordan_U: Oh, I see. Well, that I suppose I can live with.
[01:49] <JohnM555>  I think I have really messed up my wireless settings(never was working really) Is there a way I can just clear all my interface settings and start again? Now when I try editing my wireless interface, I constantly get errors I shouldn't be getting.
[01:50] <JohnM555>  Also, When trying to set the key for my interface, I get 'Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : SET failed on device eth2 : Unknown error 524', why is this happening, or how can I get more information on this error.
[01:50] <eltech> so how does ubuntu stand up as a distrobution
[01:50] <eltech> in a server enviroment?
[01:50] <Zehrila> nalioth: Well, actually I don't want to download all of them if I can download one and just install the other desktop environments over them. I'm on dialup. =[
[01:50] <eltech> as a server .. wow a lil tied up :)
[01:50] <tonyyarusso> eltech: Well, I have a server running right next to me here.
[01:50] <eltech> so do i
[01:50] <eltech> :)
[01:50] <tonyyarusso> Seems fine
[01:51] <eltech> that wasnt what i asked :P
[01:51] <noxxle> im trying to share files with a friend on my network that is using windows XP. i have a single folder shared in my /home directory. He can see my computer on his network places but when he clicks it, it asks for a username and pass. nothing works here, i try to enter my login and pass but no avail
[01:51] <noxxle> help
[01:51] <nalioth> Zehrila: you can do this procedure with alternate-install CDs of kubuntu, ubuntu and xubuntu  if you wish
[01:51] <eltech> ive got a gentoo and a centos box
[01:51] <noxxle> i choose samba when i shared my folder
[01:51] <eltech> looking to build a new production box
[01:51] <noxxle> i can see HIS shared folder on MY computer
[01:51] <Zehrila> Jordan_U: BTW if instead of using kubuntu-desktop, I chose kde-core, I won't have to deal with all the KDE apps, right?
[01:52] <tonyyarusso> eltech: What do you mean by "stand up" then?  It runs and does everything I've asked it to so far..anything in particular you're looking for?
[01:52] <Jordan_U> Zehrila: Yes.
[01:52] <Zehrila> nalioth: Yeah, but that would also involve downloading alternate-install CDs for each kubuntu disto, no?
[01:52] <Zehrila> Jordan_U: Great, thanks. =] 
[01:52] <noxxle> help me
[01:52] <wildchild> where is firefox located if I installed it by apt?
[01:52] <eltech> tonyyarusso you manage everything via yum?
[01:52] <tonyyarusso> eltech: No, aptitude.  (yum is an rpm thing, no?)
[01:53] <nalioth> Zehrila: your local university or shipit may provide you with ready-made discs
[01:53] <eltech> running mail, dns, web, etc?
[01:53] <eltech> aptget
[01:53] <nalioth> Zehrila: also your library may have ways to let you get the discs
[01:53] <Zehrila> nalioth: I'm in a third world country which isn't too *nix-aware yet, heh.
[01:53] <scubes13> eltech: for server, may wanna give Annvix a look over, very nice distro - just my $0.02
[01:53] <eltech> after 5 years of gentoo break fix.. i need a easy path for a few months :P
[01:54] <caffiend> Anyone know how to extract an ISO image to a USB drive to boot and install Linux?  I have the UB-serv-6.10..
[01:54] <nalioth> Zehrila: i'm sure there are other folks here that are near you
[01:54] <eltech> scubes13 will do .. im also considering openbsd
[01:54] <Zehrila> Downloading seems to be the only option, since Shipit doesn't seem to be offering 6.10.
[01:54] <eltech> and completely going the other with postfix rather then qmail
[01:54] <eltech> im just tired .. :)
[01:54] <tonyyarusso> caffiend: I think I bookmarked something about that...hold on
[01:54] <nalioth> Zehrila: please join me in #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:54] <Zehrila> nalioth: Sure.
[01:55] <noxxle> is it safe to write to a windows system on my network?

[01:55] <Jordan_U> wildchild: Ignore that :)
[01:55] <JosefK> noxxle: over Samba/Windows File Sharing - yes
[01:55] <tonyyarusso> caffiend: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick perhaps

[01:56] <noxxle> noxxle how is that safe? i heard writing to NTFS can corrupt things
[01:56] <Pelo> good evening folks
[01:56] <Jordan_U> wildchild: That is the output of: whereis firefox :)
[01:56] <scubes13> eltech: let me know what you think of it when u give it a try, need help, etc check over at #annvix ;)
[01:56] <JosefK> noxxle: it isn't NTFS if it's over a network though, you're using SMB - the remote machine handles all the actual I/O to the drive
[01:56] <MarcN> noxxle: only if you are using linux to write to an NTFS disk.
[01:56] <noxxle> oh ok great!
[01:56] <eltech> scubes13 thanks for the offer :)
[01:57] <noxxle> any idea why my friend cannot connect to me, but i can connect to him
[01:57] <scubes13> eltech: no probs
[01:57] <caffiend> tonyyarusso: muchas gracias mi amigo! :)
[01:57] <JosefK> noxxle: firewall/router?
[01:57] <noxxle> thats not it
[01:57] <canute> Hi there, because of my ber lameness, my brain switched the mv and rm commands. So basicly i removed a file which i was suppose to move, is there some command to get that file back?
[01:57] <scubes13> anyone have experience with ath0 under edgy?
[01:57] <JosefK> canute: nope
[01:57] <JosefK> canute: hard lesson, but well learned (make backups :/)
[01:57] <canute> heh
[01:58] <Pelo> canute,  look for a back up file
[01:58] <Pelo> or tell us the name of the file and I will dcc it to you
[01:58] <JosefK> true, there's a possibility there's a file there as 'Filename~'
[01:58] <canute> this was a php file i had been working on
[01:58] <JosefK> canute: if you were working on it in gedit/vim, there'll be that backup file
=== LagChick is now known as SportChick
[01:59] <canute> hm, gPHPedit :p
[01:59] <JosefK> canute: ls -a in the same path to find it
[01:59] <rogue78> is there any software for ubuntu like dragon naturally speaking?
[01:59] <JosefK> canute: hmm :/ it's worth a try anyway :)
[01:59] <webhed> Anyone familiar with Musicbrainz or Picard?
[01:59] <Pelo> canute,  backup file will be  filename.exte~
[02:00] <canute> bah, no backup
[02:00] <JosefK> canute: if you're worried about it in future, edit your ~/.bashrc and add 'alias rm="rm -i"'
[02:00] <JosefK> canute: that'll at least give you a prompt and a mental jog before you remove anything (you can add -f if you want to override the warning)
[02:01] <canute> ok

[02:25] <Pelo> NewcomerXb,  check the forum for mounting  hdd instrustions
[02:25] <NewcomerXb> it used to load from the HD where winxp is
[02:25] <kitche> LjL: no on another page it has the update-manager -c scratched out and says don't use this since we have many bug reports on it breaking a system
[02:25] <NewcomerXb> ive tried to forum ;_; its not  mounting problem. it simply isnt recognizing the drives somehow

[02:27] <Pelo> NewcomerXb,  therer should be a boot order options somewhere in your bios

[02:27] <NewcomerXb> ok
[02:27] <youser> it still said i have no permissions
[02:27] <youser> i opened nautilus
[02:27] <youser> went to computer
[02:28] <youser> went to the folder tried to put the filesin and it said i dont have permissions
[02:28] <Pelo> dAndy,   just open up aptitude and search for mplayer,  then install that package,  dependencies if any should be installed right along

[02:40] <profoX`> guevara: the live cd?
[02:40] <guevara> profoX` just a momment
[02:40] <profoX`> guevara: i'm thinking of 3 possible causes of that problem
[02:41] <kitche> martyyyr: you will have to use the root version of your filemanager but be careful sicne it can do damage if you delete something that's not suppose to be
[02:41] <LjL> !sudo | martyyyr
[02:41] <ubotu> martyyyr: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[02:41] <martyyyr> oh just use sudo...
[02:41] <Suspect> LjL: justin@Plutonium:~$ sudo ntfsmount /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 -o umask=0007
[02:41] <Suspect> Couldn't mount device '/dev/hda1': Invalid argument
[02:41] <Suspect> Mount failed.
[02:41] <LjL> martyyyr, no
[02:41] <Suspect> :x
[02:41] <profoX`> guevara: 1. either your cdrom/dvdrom player is broken, or 2. DMA doesn't work/isn't enabled on your cd/dvd player, or 3. you have ACPI problems causing everything to hang and run hella slow
[02:41] <LjL> !paste | Suspect

[02:41] <guevara> Version 6.06 for PC
[02:41] <porcho> martyyyr, when u start the file browser, it sticks to your uid, which identifies u as a user...so you are just allowed to list dirs u have permission to...
[02:41] <LjL> i've never tried the NTFS stuff anyway, Suspect
[02:41] <Suspect> Alright
[02:41] <martyyyr> hm..
[02:41] <Suspect> I don't consider 3 lines a flood
[02:42] <Suspect> if it was like 5+ I would use a pastebin
[02:42] <martyyyr> well, I typed   sudo nautilus in a terminal
[02:42] <martyyyr> and now I can access the files
[02:42] <porcho> if you do sudo, then u're running file browser as superuser...so u can access any dir...

[02:43] <profoX`> argh remove the s
[02:43] <guevara> profoX` no...
[02:44] <martyyyr> does apt-get always download stuff from the net?
[02:44] <guevara> profoX` what is the command to open the system monitor?
[02:44] <kitche> martyyyr: it can use a cdrom as well but pretty much yes
[02:44] <martyyyr> :S
[02:44] <profoX`> guevara: gnome-system-monitor
[02:44] <martyyyr> then why on earth does this "how to get your wireless working" howto tell me to use apt-get to download drivers :S
[02:44] <LjL> martyyyr, apt-get is used to get new applications... what did you expect? :o)
[02:44] <profoX`> guevara: or just go to Administrtion -> system monitor
[02:45] <profoX`> or something like that
[02:45] <profoX`> don't know how it is in english
[02:45] <jrib> martyyyr: probably on the cd.  What exactly do you need?
[02:45] <LjL> martyyyr, it assumes you can connect temporarily via other means. unfortunately some wireless cards are hard to get to work, thanks to the manufacturers, and you mostly do need to use apt-get to try and get them to work
[02:45] <Poromenos> how do i see wpa_supplicant's status?

[02:47] <profoX`> guevara: according to a french ubuntu wiki (I'm not french, but I can read it ;) i read your travelmate should work pretty good with ubuntu....
[02:47] <shonen> its a cut and paste kinda deal LeoStewart
[02:47] <BudSmoker> what arguments would i need

[02:58] <LjL> actually, i suggest adding an alias that turns "rm" into "rm -i", that's what i do

[02:58] <rwoes> ok i am an azz
[02:58] <rwoes> thanks bruenig -- that is an excellent idea

[03:03] <crimsun> atheros iirc
[03:03] <imme> Hey all. What do I need to look for if I want to cahnge the startupscreen, the one that first said ubuntu, but now says kubuntu? The one with the texts underneath...
[03:03] <lullabud> crimsun:  try `lspci` to make sure.
[03:03] <bsnider> what's a good tv app for gnome?
[03:04] <lullabud> imme:  system -> administration -> login screen
[03:04] <crimsun> Poromenos: see lullabud's statement

[03:04] <lullabud> Poromenos:  you could grep -i atheros if you want, or you could | less
[03:04] <syko21> how do you edit the startup programs manually? i added beryl manager but it keeps crashing the panels in Gnome so i need to remove it from the startup list
[03:05] <imme> lullabud: Nope... before that... before X11 even starts
[03:05] <porcho> exit
[03:05] <lullabud> Poromenos:  or you could just scroll that.
[03:05] <lullabud> imme:  if it says kde, you're probably using KDE as your default window manager.  did you install the KDE package?
[03:05] <Poromenos> texas instruments
[03:05] <lullabud> imme:  either way, you can log in and change the preferences of the login window.
[03:05] <LjL> lullabud, he's talking about usplash i think, not about the display manager
[03:06] <imme> lullabud: I'm not talking about the login window. and it doesn't say kde, it says kubuntu, and it's because I have also got kubuntu installed, but I want it to display something else.
[03:07] <lullabud> imme:  oooh, the splash.
[03:07] <imme> lullabud: That could be it.
[03:07] <lullabud> imme:  yeah, i don't know anything about that.  i never see that screen anyways. :P
[03:07] <imme> lullabud: Quick computer or no restarts?
[03:08] <lullabud> imme:  no restarts.
[03:08] <lullabud> imme:  and mostly headless anyhow.

[03:15] <ger> I'm having a fonts problem, I can't readthe ones in my web browser.
[03:15] <ger> Any help??
[03:16] <Pelo> ger,  what too small ?
[03:16] <ger> no, un-readable
[03:16] <Pelo> ger, which browser ?
[03:16] <ger> only can read them when I highlight them

[03:16] <lullabud> so, i was talking to a guy from canonical today and he was saying that ubuntu runs faster on the Sun Fire T2000 than solaris does.
[03:16] <lullabud> =D
[03:16] <burner> fiveiron: use network-manager :)
[03:16] <Pelo> ger,  check the prefs
[03:16] <orville> i can't install flash.
[03:16] <ger> in the browser?
[03:17] <pudland> i followed the howto. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager... I get a blue/grey checkered startup screen but no beryl splash
[03:17] <Pelo> ger,  what do you think ???
[03:17] <burner> fiveiron: better yet, sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[03:17] <pudland>  beryl-man is running as is emerald/Xgl/xorg
[03:17] <ger> ok,ok
[03:17] <orville> why can't i install flash in ubuntu?

[03:17] <pudland> any ideas?
[03:18] <orville> burner: it wont install. from synaptic
[03:18] <JohnM555> Hey burner, I installed the network-manager deb by transfering it via usb because I dont have internet access on my machine, how can I launch the program?
[03:18] <JohnM555> (I already installed it)
[03:18] <orville> it's been "Downloading..." for about 5 minutes now
[03:18] <orville> I also can't install it from within the browser.
[03:18] <burner> JohnM555: run "nm-applet" ?
[03:18] <X5-452> Thanks everybody
[03:18] <JohnM555> Type that into the terminal?
[03:19] <burner> JohnM555: or via alt+f2
[03:19] <JohnM555> Ok
[03:19] <orville> does anyone have the flash package available?
[03:19] <burner> fiveiron: after you get network-manager-gnome or network-manager-kde (your choice) then run nm-applet if it doesn't just show up in the notification area

[03:20] <burner> orville: i swear it's in the repositories
[03:20] <JohnM555> burner: I typed nm-applet in the termal but that didn't work, am I doing it wrong?
[03:20] <JohnM555> terminal*
[03:20] <burner> did an error come up in the term?
[03:20] <tonyyarusso> burner: How is it for you?  (Haven't tried it yet)
[03:20] <burner> JohnM555: do you have a notification area in the taskbar?
[03:20] <JohnM555> burner: nm-applet: command not found
[03:20] <orville> Pelo: yes. i'm already at that page. which is how i got to the "Downloading..." part... which doesn't actually download.
[03:20] <JohnM555> burner: Um...I don't even know :\
[03:20] <JohnM555> burner: probably not...
[03:21] <burner> JohnM555: you didn't get network-manager-gnome then
[03:21] <burner> JohnM555: you need that as well as network-manager
[03:21] <JohnM555> alright
[03:21] <tonyyarusso> JohnM555, burner: Likely means network-manager was installed, but not network-manager-gnome, which is a "recommends" dependency, meaning synaptic won't get it by default
[03:21] <bkinman> what is the command to begin the ubuntu installer from the ubuntu desktop disk?
[03:21] <Pelo> orville read the instuctions carefuly
[03:21] <tonyyarusso> bkinman: Double-click?
[03:21] <JohnM555> burner: ohh ok, I'll look that up on the internet. Its a pain not having internet on my ubuntu. I have to transfer everything via usb
[03:21] <burner> fiveiron: forgot if i answered, but network-manager rocks!  still some issues with wpa networks i think, but other than that I love it
[03:22] <burner> JohnM555: it have a wireless?  or wired?
[03:22] <bkinman> tonyyarusso: x is not working for me.
[03:22] <fiveiron> burner, i'm having some trouble finding that... its not on the CD is it...
[03:22] <orville> Pelo: i have. if there is magical reference between the lines which i'm suppsed to be discerning then mayhaps you should just point it out.
[03:22] <burner> JohnM555: you don't need network-manager to get internet working ;)
[03:22] <burner> fiveiron: it's not... apt-get it
[03:22] <orville> reading, believe it or not, is something i'm capable of.
[03:22] <tonyyarusso> bkinman: Ah.  That's a bummer..
[03:22] <rsl> Anyone else running Amarok?
[03:22] <JohnM555> burner: I am trying to get wireless to work on it. and I want to use the network-manager because everything else I have tried failed
[03:22] <orville> rsl: i am
[03:23] <tom_> i use amarok
[03:23] <tonyyarusso> bkinman: Might need to use the alternate CD then; I'm not sure if what you want is possible with the desktop.
[03:23] <JohnM555> I think I messed up my interface, I used to be able to set the wep key but now I can't, is there a way to reset all my wireless settings?
[03:23] <burner> JohnM555: iwconfig and a dhclient usually work for me, but try network-manager-gnome first, then we'll talk command line wireless config :)
[03:23] <JohnM555> burner: Ok
[03:23] <rsl> orville, when you run lsof /dev/snd/* from a terminal, do you get like 6 lines with amarokapp?
[03:23] <rsl> I'm trying to figure out if that's normal.
[03:23] <fiveiron> burner, i'm fine with command line... already reading up on iwconfig
[03:23] <bkinman> tonyyarusso: I could probably configure x to work on my machine from the desktop cd... how would i go about that though?
[03:24] <burner> JohnM555: you can set it via the gnome system->administration->networking
[03:24] <orville> rsl: yes
[03:24] <rsl> orville, cool.
[03:24] <JohnM555> burner: Oh believe me, I've tried :\
[03:24] <burner> lol
[03:24] <Poromenos> how can i make ubuntu desktop into a LAMP server, is there a list of what I have to install?
[03:24] <tonyyarusso> bkinman: Either through 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' or manually editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf if that doesn't work.
[03:24] <JohnM555> burner: I tried using wifi-radio...I tried using iwconfig...I always mess something up
[03:24] <rsl> I've been having problems with sound but I think I fixed them by disabling the esd and system sounds in system > preferences > sound.
[03:24] <lullabud> Poromenos:  apache, mysql and php. ;-)
[03:24] <tom_> i have a question about permissions
[03:25] <burner> JohnM555: make sure to comment everything out of /etc/network/interfaces before using nm-applet
[03:25] <Poromenos> lullabud: which packages exactly, i mean :P
[03:25] <Poromenos> also the p stands for python!
[03:25] <JohnM555> burner: Ah I can do that? Ok :)
[03:25] <JohnM555> burner: I comment with a '#' right?
[03:25] <burner> yep

[03:26] <Oni-Dracula> getting sick of middle click for context menu, anyone know how to change this?
[03:27] <infidel> ati modules i have to load it manually
[03:27] <fiveiron> Poromenos, do you have access to the DHCP server?
[03:27] <lullabud> Poromenos:  i had a similar problem that was fixed after a reboot.  very strange...

[03:27] <Poromenos> fiveiron: i do
[03:27] <Pelo> Oni-Dracula,  search the forum for mouse buttons
[03:27] <burner> JohnM555: plug it in temporarily to get network-manager-gnome all set up :)
[03:27] <Poromenos> my router is bugged and returns 1.0.0.0 for DNS requests
[03:27] <fiveiron> Poromenos, then just set up the DNS servers in the dhcpd.conf
[03:27] <fiveiron> on the DHCP server
[03:27] <tom_> when i change permissions to get HP scanjet 3970 using sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/005/002 it works fine until i reboot and permissions change back to root Anyon know why?
[03:27] <JohnM555> burner: whats 'it'?
[03:28] <Poromenos> ah, it's a router, and i have set those up, it's not getting them
[03:28] <Poromenos> can i just set them up manually on the client?
[03:28] <Poromenos> like, static ip and all
[03:28] <JohnM555> burner: I can't plug any ethernet in, this is on a desktop pc, theres a reason why I need wireless :P
[03:28] <fiveiron> Poromenos, are you talking a LOCAL dhcp server?  or your ISP?
[03:28] <Poromenos> fiveiron: my local dhcp
[03:28] <infidel>  modprobe fglrx FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/volatile/fglrx.ko': No such file or directory
[03:28] <Poromenos> actually, how can i set a static ip?
[03:28] <burner> good luck JohnM555
[03:28] <fiveiron> and you have a line like this in your dhcpd.conf:  option domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220;
[03:29] <burner> Poromenos: set your /etc/network/interfaces file... google for examples
[03:29] <Poromenos> fiveiron: i configured it through its web interface
[03:29] <Poromenos> it's a WRT54GL
[03:29] <burner> Poromenos: update the firmware?
[03:29] <lullabud> tom_:  it's likely that since it's a usb device that directory is getting created on the fly when the printer is plugged in...
[03:29] <fiveiron> yeah

[03:29] <lullabud> tom_:  so... i don't know the fix, but whatever the cmask is for that dir is is wrong.
[03:30] <burner> Poromenos: set dns in your routers dhcp area to be that of the router
[03:30] <tom_> is there a way to fix it?
[03:30] <fiveiron> this is so weird.... every once in a while one of my pc's will lose its IP address... and I can't get it back... dhclient doesn't get any response back from my server...
[03:30] <Poromenos> burner: that wouldn't work, i have set them to my ISPs
[03:30] <rsl> Is there a way to record the sound going on on my computer? Not a physical sound but the output that Amarok and any music program is giving me.
[03:30] <burner> tom_: i could be way off, but you might want to search about hotplug
[03:30] <Pelo> tom_,   look under system > admin > users and give yourself permission to print there
[03:30] <Poromenos> it's does get the router
[03:30] <tonyyarusso> tom_: Stuff in /dev is auto-configured on boot I believe.  You should probably add yourself to a group I would think, but I don't know exactly how your printer is set up.
[03:30] <Poromenos> it's much simpler for me to set the client with a static ip
[03:30] <tom_> thanks lullabud
[03:31] <Poromenos> how can i install a .deb from the command line?
[03:31] <burner> Poromenos: so edit your config file then... /etc/network/interfaces
[03:31] <Poromenos> burner: will do, thanks :)
[03:31] <burner> sudo dpkg -i blah.deb
[03:31] <tonyyarusso> rsl: Yeah,...I think it's called "capture" in the various inputs (alsamixer, Gnome sound record, etc. settings)
[03:31] <tom_> HP scanjet 3970 is a scanner
[03:31] <Poromenos> great, thanks :)
[03:31] <burner> Poromenos: you can also use the gui... i forget that being old fashioned... system->admin->networking

[03:33] <WC`> specifically with sleep mode on my laptop
[03:33] <Poromenos> burner: no, sadly... i don't think it will ever be
[03:33] <WC`> it enters sleep mode just fine

[03:34] <WC`> I enter sleep mode, but when I power back on, all I get is a blank screen. Has anyone heard of this issue?
[03:35] <burner> Poromenos: do you know if the local machine can do a freenx login from gdm instead of a local X?  that might be a solution

[03:35] <mzli> burner, what's freenx?
[03:35] <Samin> is there an English-Greek dictionary or a wordlist, that I can use with gnome-dictionary or kdict?
[03:35] <WC`> I did, and all I found was using vim to edit a file and uncomment one of the lines regarding the video state being saved
[03:36] <Poromenos> samin: are you greek?
[03:36] <WC`> I tried implementing their fix to no avail
[03:36] <pastillegirl> burner thanks :)
[03:36] <Samin> Poromenos, no, but learning Greek
[03:36] <mzli> samiam, you may use stardict for an dic.
[03:36] <Poromenos> Samin: ah
[03:36] <burner> np pastillegirl.... there's also jokosher, but that might be overkill and it's still very new
[03:36] <Poromenos> well, i'm greek if you need anything :p

[03:40] <JohnM555> Do most people use ubuntu on laptops?
[03:40] <dougfunnie> the official version from adobe site
[03:40] <caffiend> Can someone help me out with either mounting an ISO file or extracting it's contents to a USB drive?
[03:40] <Pelo> WC`,  just a thought but try disableing the screen shutdown and the other power saving stuff if you are using sleep mode
[03:40] <dougfunnie> crimsun
[03:40] <mzli> JohnM555, anywhere you want.
[03:41] <dougfunnie> actually, i use gentoo, the ubuntu is on my brother's pc
[03:41] <crimsun> dougfunnie: flash 9 beta or 7.0.68?
[03:41] <WC`> Alright Pelo, I'll give that a shot
[03:41] <Samin> caffiend, sudo mount -o loop foo.iso /mnt/somewhere
[03:41] <pastillegirl> burner, do most people connect the stero ouput to the mic input on the computer to import?  someone told me that in #ubuntuforums
[03:41] <JohnM555> mzli: I know you can use it anywhere, I just see lots of people mention ubuntu+laptops in here
[03:41] <dougfunnie> crimsun 7
[03:41] <pastillegirl> s/ouput/output
[03:41] <mzli> JohnM555, ofcourse it is.
[03:41] <sproingie> JohnM555: laptops is typically where linux generates a lot of support questions
[03:41] <tonyyarusso> JohnM555: You could check the ubuntu counter / user surveys and see
[03:41] <[erisco] > (OFF TOPIC: how do you get into overflow protected channels?)
[03:42] <crimsun> dougfunnie: please remove 7 and use the beta of 9
[03:42] <sproingie> JohnM555: largely due to wireless problems
[03:42] <JohnM555> mzli: And when installing wireless its almost expected you are able to connect up an ethernet cable. If I could use an ethernet cable on my pc I wouldn't need wireless :P
[03:42] <caffiend> Samin: Thanks, this is for a Ubuntu_Server_install that I want to copy to a USB drive.  Will it include all the hidden files?
[03:42] <JohnM555> tonyyarusso: Thanks, I'm not that interested though :P
[03:42] <dougfunnie> crimsun ok
[03:42] <fiveiron> brb
[03:42] <mzli> JohnM555, ubuntu supports wireless too.
[03:43] <Samin> caffiend, just copy all the files (cp -a) in the directory where you mounted the ISO
[03:43] <sproingie> [erisco] : overflow channels are usually capped with a slow rate increase to avoid takeover storms.  try joining again in a few minutes
=== charles is now known as cw
[03:43] <JohnM555> mzli: I know that, its just lots of tools for helping with wireless are expected to be downloaded via apt-get and such (That I see anyway)
[03:43] <[erisco] > okay thanks sproingie
=== cw is now known as cw_asmara
[03:44] <WC`> Pelo: no effect. Still get a blank screen when I try to come back from suspend.
[03:44] <mzli> JohnM555, :P
[03:44] <caffiend> samin: cp -a /mnt/somewhere /dev/destination ??
[03:44] <Pelo> WC`,  it was worth a shot
[03:44] <WC`> Indeed
[03:44] <JohnM555> Ugh...I just installed the dependancy, yet the other dependancy says it isn't satisfiable!(Just frustrated)
[03:45] <FlavioTrash> alguem pode me ajudar aqui com o no-ip?
[03:45] <Poromenos> ok, i set my ip to static, but the DNS servers aren't stored in /etc/network/interfaces, where are they?
[03:45] <FlavioTrash> no-ip
[03:45] <tonyyarusso> !pt | FlavioTrash
[03:45] <ubotu> FlavioTrash: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[03:45] <tonyyarusso> (Did I get that right?)
[03:45] <magnet> Poromenos: /etc/resolv.conf
[03:45] <Poromenos> magnet: thanks
[03:45] <FlavioTrash>  so uma pergunta sobre o no-ip
[03:46] <mzli> FlavioTrash, what's your language?
[03:46] <bkinman> what is the key command to restart the x server?
[03:46] <magnet> bkinman: /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[03:46] <bkinman> heh, that works.
[03:47] <magnet> or Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
[03:47] <caffiend> does cp -a copy all the subdirectories or do I need an R or r in there?
[03:47] <FlavioTrash> alguem pode me ajudar aqui com o no-ip?
[03:47] <Samin> caffiend, yeah add -R
[03:47] <FlavioTrash> alguem pode me ajudar aqui com o no-ip?
[03:47] <caffiend> thanks!
[03:47] <LjL> !pt | FlavioTrash
[03:47] <ubotu> FlavioTrash: Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[03:48] <WC`> Interesting
[03:48] <lullabud> caffiend:  you need the -r
[03:48] <WC`> When i go to put it into standby, it activates the screensaver for some reason
[03:48] <lullabud> caffiend:  er... -R.  dammit, i wish they'd keep the capitalization for common switches consistent.
[03:49] <tonyyarusso> WC`: I've noticed that my screensaver kicks in when I close my laptop lid, making the machine heat up.
[03:49] <nexl> hi all
[03:49] <magnet> lullabud: POSIX's -r is just a loose -R, but GNU's -r is the same as -R :)
[03:49] <novaterata> how could people that use both vi and emacs keep anything consistent
[03:49] <FlavioTrash> alguem pode me ajudar aqui com o no-ip?
[03:49] <magnet> novaterata: the same way people use qwerty then dvorak keymaps :)
[03:50] <WC`> tony: i can't recover from going into standby, and I just read the screensaver might have something to do with it. Know of any way to disable it?
[03:50] <tonyyarusso> FlavioTrash: Sorry, this is an English-only channel.  You may do better elsewhere.
[03:50] <edgarin> Hi to all
[03:50] <sproingie> portugese or not, repeating the question every few seconds is not cool
[03:50] <nexl> anyone knows why my samba shares won't mount themselves, but a "sudo mount -a" works?
[03:51] <nexl> I mean at boot time
[03:51] <pontusen> is anyone here using opendchub?
[03:51] <JohnM555> Why does god hate me? Seriously, My packages are complaining they are missing dependancies when Synaptic shows them as being installed
[03:52] <Lubix> hey
[03:52] <tonyyarusso> JohnM555: 'apt-get -f install' might fix it, maybe
[03:52] <JohnM555> tonyyarusso: I need to be on the internet for that to work, don't I?
[03:53] <Samin> JohnM555, yeah
[03:53] <JohnM555> tonyyarusso: What if I just have the debs on my computer?
[03:53] <magnet> JohnM555: if god hates you, you should use Ubuntu Christian Edition (http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/christianubuntu/2006/07/about-ubuntu-christian-edition.html) ;)
[03:53] <tonyyarusso> JohnM555: Depends what packages you have installed.  If just the originals, could use a CD
[03:53] <rhodri> hi, is there a way to just install specific parts of a package?  my problem is i need to install the restricted-modules package to make my wifi card work, but when i do it stops my ati driver from working for some reason.  so could i just install the wifi driver from this package somehow?  thanks
[03:53] <novaterata> either i chmodded the worng thing or the dapper to edgy upgrade did it but i can't su or sudo, i can use root terminal though, what do i need to chmod to what?
[03:53] <JohnM555> magnet: Good idea :P
[03:53] <tonyyarusso> JohnM555: Might still work if you have the cache
[03:53] <Samin> magnet, heh
[03:53] <JohnM555> tonyyarusso I'll try :\
[03:53] <novaterata> if i su or sudo it says incorrect password even though its the one root console uses
[03:54] <Samin> magnet, wow! those links are for real! :D
[03:54] <novaterata> Ubuntu Christian Edition actually looks pretty loaded for a distro
[03:54] <magnet> Samin: haha :)
[03:54] <magnet> of course there are
[03:54] <WC`> disabling the screensaver didn't work :(
[03:54] <sproingie> jesubuntu
[03:54] <magnet> don't underestimate crazy people on the net :)
[03:55] <novaterata> or X-ubuntu.... oh nwm
[03:55] <Samin> magnet ;)
[03:55] <tonyyarusso> novaterata: Ubuntu comes with X now?  No way!
[03:55] <novaterata> nvm i mean
[03:55] <sproingie> or go with the greek spelling and call it iesubuntu
[03:55] <lullabud> tonyyarusso:  mine didn't. :(
[03:55] <tonyyarusso> sad
[03:55] <JohnM555> "Package network-manager-gnome is not availible, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only availible from another source" Yay! :\
[03:55] <magnet> rhodri: there is no easy way
[03:56] <rhodri> so...  what's the hard way?  :-/
[03:56] <magnet> (but it *is* possible)
[03:56] <rhodri> download the package and look inside myself?
[03:56] <Samin> JohnM555, had the same message a couple of days ago when I tried installing audacious ( or was it something else?) I tried later and it worked
[03:56] <magnet> well, you build your kernel modules and package them :)
[03:56] <JohnM555> Samin: Well you had internet :P
[03:57] <rhodri> i see...  no way to just take out what i need from the package?
[03:57] <Samin> JohnM555, yeah, don't you? how come you are online now?:P
[03:57] <JohnM555> magnet: The whole point of this is to get wireless working, I should probably just be able to get it working via the terminal
[03:57] <magnet> no downloading the package is bad, modules need to configure your /etc/modprobe.d/, /etc/modules and so on
[03:57] <Pelo> g'night folks
[03:57] <novaterata> I bet Ubuntu C.E. could be turned into Xenobuntu pretty easily just add some samurai swords and talking bunnies
[03:57] <Samin> rhodri, you need to take a specific file from a .deb file?
[03:57] <JohnM555> samin: I'm on my XP laptop, my ubuntu is on my pc next to me with no internet
[03:57] <Samin> JohnM555, oh I see
[03:58] <h3htimo> hey guys, im having trouble with fgrlx not working properly, im running edgy and i used this: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide#Method_1:_Installing_Edgy.27s_Included_Driver_.288.28.8.29 to upgrade but nothing seems to be working... any idea??
[03:58] <h3htimo> ideas?
[03:58] <JohnM555> Samin: Its definately a pain :P
[03:58] <novaterata> sooo is beryl a good idea right now?
[03:58] <WC`> Is it normal for Ubuntu not to recognize what processor you have?
[03:58] <lullabud> JohnM555:  no sneaker net of any sort?  or no firewire?
[03:58] <rhodri> Samin: yeah, i just want the userspace binary package for the ipw3945 module (i think)
[03:58] <Samin> JohnM555, same thing here believe me, I am on xp now, because I screwed my ubuntu box ( and working on getting it online too) :P
[03:58] <JohnM555> lullabud: Sneaker net?
[03:58] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you know.  floppy disk, usb disk, thumb drive.
[03:59] <JohnM555> lullabud: I have been using a usb drive to transfer some debs
[03:59] <lullabud> JohnM555:  soooo....?  is this .deb too large or what?
[03:59] <rhodri> Samin: or if i could just edit the package to not install the fglrx part maybe?  somehow?  :-/
[03:59] <magnet> JohnM555: ethernet ?
[03:59] <novaterata> is it running slower than it should WC?
[03:59] <JohnM555> samin: But did you have your ability to add WEP passwords to your interface magically disapear :P
[04:00] <JohnM555> magnet: No, if I had ethernet I wouldn't need wireless. Its not a laptop(with ubuntu)
[04:00] <WC`> nova: no, it seems to be running just fine
[04:00] <Samin> rhodri, I don't understand you well, can't you just "dpkg -x foo.deb" this will extract the files in a directory, is that what yo want?
[04:00] <WC`> a celeron M 1.5ghz
[04:00] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you could disable wep, install the stuff, then re-enable it.
[04:00] <WC`> however in device manager, it says "unknown" under everything
[04:00] <JohnM555> lullabud: No, I even installed it, but the other dependancy doesn't think its installed, I even tried reinstalling it
[04:00] <magnet> JohnM555: desktops may have ethernet too you know :) any decent PC ought to have at least one ethernet plug
[04:00] <JohnM555> lullabud: Yea but I don't have control of the AP
[04:00] <rhodri> yes!  that would be a start atleast, can i then edit it and install it as i'd like?
[04:01] <Rookie_> If the device manager says unknown it can be a good idea to tell the manager what it is
[04:01] <JohnM555> magnet: My pc has ethernet, but I
[04:01] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you could do IP over serial, IP over firewire...
[04:01] <Samin> rhodri, yeah
[04:01] <JohnM555> but im too far from my cable modem for that
[04:01] <magnet> JohnM555: ok
[04:01] <nexl> g'night all
[04:01] <WC`> Rookie: how do I do that?
[04:01] <magnet> well, go on on usinh usb storage devices then
[04:01] <Rookie_> you know what you have ?
[04:01] <magnet> s/usinh/using
[04:01] <pastillegirl> burner, thanks!! i did it :)
[04:01] <rhodri> Samin:  ok, thanks for the hple that's excellent, i
[04:01] <pastillegirl> working great :)
[04:02] <rhodri> m gonna look into it now, cheers!
[04:02] <Samin> rhodri, you're welcome :)
[04:02] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you could use the original install cd...
[04:02] <WC`> Rookie: yes
[04:02] <JohnM555> magnet: Do you guys have any idea why my ability to set my wep encryption on my interface would go away. Its not even listed in iwconfig
[04:02] <JohnM555> lullabud: How would I use it, to get packages? I do have it in, I guess I should search on their first
[04:02] <Rookie_> Oki, sorry but i just saw the last lines ... so if you know what you have and its installed ... what was your problem ?
[04:02] <magnet> JohnM555: no I'm still in the ethernet era :) I don't have any wifi devices anywhere
[04:02] <lullabud> JohnM555:  apt-cdrom
[04:03] <JohnM555> magnet: Lucky :P
[04:03] <magnet> JohnM555: my brain is :)
[04:03] <JohnM555> lullabud: I didn't know that command existed :P. I was using  the Synaptic Package Manager
[04:04] <magnet> wifi is like cigarets, D-link and Netgear will be sued in 30 years just like Marlboro and Philip Morris were :))
[04:04] <caffiend> lullabud: Samin: Thanks for the help.  I did cp -Rav /source/* to /destination/ and it is moving along GREAT!!
[04:04] <WC`> Rookie: I'm having some problems recovering from standby mode, since the fixes on the forum don't work, I'm trying to see if maybe it's a driver/hardware unrecognized issue
[04:04] <Samin> caffiend, glad it worked :)
[04:04] <magnet> 'night ppl
[04:04] <lullabud> caffiend:  doesn't it feel great when things work how you want them to?  especially at the terminal?  God i love that shit.
[04:04] <JohnM555> lullabud: How do I use apt-cdrom?
[04:05] <JohnM555> magnet: Cya, thanks for um, trying to help :P
[04:05] <lullabud> JohnM555:  `apt-cdrom`.  it'll aks you to put in a cd.
[04:05] <magnet> lol :)
[04:05] <magnet> np :)
[04:05] <JohnM555> lullabud: The cd is already in :P
[04:05] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you put it in.  it scans it.  then you just `apt-get install` like normal.
[04:05] <Rookie_> I see - i heard of this problem ( dont have it my self ) - sorry then, but i dont have a clue, sorry i took up your time
[04:05] <JohnM555> lullabud: Oh...
[04:05] <caffiend> lullabud: yeah, especiall since I've been dealing with one probelm for hours and am on the right path now!
[04:06] <lullabud> caffiend:  long problems learn you good.  today i finally got an ubuntu 6.06 install working on a Dell 2850 with a Perc 5 RAID controller.  the shizz you have to go through... wow.
[04:06] <lullabud> yeah, i learned a lot...
[04:07] <lullabud> caffiend:  was working on that for 2 weeks.
[04:07] <JohnM555> lullabud: I'm just going to try wifi again via the command line...I just need to figure out why I can't even see that there is no encryption, the entire option is hidden from view and setting it returns an error
[04:07] <JohnM555> lullabud: Is there a way for me to reset all wireless settings?
[04:07] <lullabud> JohnM555:  yeah, i've had bad luck with wifi in ubuntu.
[04:07] <Intelligitimate> Has anyone ever tried to get Pythonol to work? It is like the only educational Linux software for learning Spanish.
[04:07] <Samin> I found an English-Greek wordlist http://xdxf.revdanica.com/down/, in case anyone needs it :)
[04:08] <Samin> Intelligitimate, I had it installed once
[04:08] <lullabud> JohnM555:  hmmm... if so, it's probably a cached file in /var/* somewhere.
[04:08] <JohnM555> lullabud: Yay, fun :)
[04:08] <Intelligitimate> Well I tried for hours to get it to install, and it never worked. I even downloaded the rpm thing and converted it to a deb, and it still didn't work.
[04:08] <lullabud> JohnM555:  you could try doing a dpkg-reconfigure on whatever the wireless packages are too.
[04:08] <caffiend> lullabud: Samin: have either of you heard of an error coming up "nobody cared" Disabling IRQ 10, 17 or 169?  It is driving me nuts!  I hve 3 P4 boxes and not one will load linux cuz of that.. so I'm trying USB..
[04:08] <Samin> Intelligitimate, dependencies problems?
[04:09] <Samin> I used alien too, then apt-get -f install , and it worked :)
[04:09] <lullabud> caffiend:  LOL, no, i've never heard of that, but thank God for humorous coders. :)
[04:09] <Intelligitimate> I don't know. I am still pretty new to Linux. Been using Ubuntu for about 3 months or so now.
[04:09] <JohnM555> lullabud: Well I'm using ndiswrapper...I've installed the driver successfully. About the only successful thing I've done besides complete some Mahjongg games on here.
[04:09] <jman_> Hi I am having some problems running OpenOffice, whenever I go to launch it, it does nothing, I tried running through the terminal same results with no output in the terminal any ideas besides reinstalling?
[04:10] <JohnM555> Dont know if that matters or not :P
[04:10] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: Using converted RPMs rarely works.
[04:10] <lullabud> JohnM555:  oh.  i've never used that.
[04:10] <jman_> I am running 6.06 dapper drake
[04:10] <bkinman> exit
[04:10] <sloucher> I just got a new SATA drive. It's great but it doesn't show up with df . How do I tell how much diskspace i'm using?
[04:10] <Intelligitimate> That was the closest thing I got to running Pythonol, Jordan_U.
[04:10] <caffiend> lullabud: long problems are do learn u good!  I know a lot I'll never forget!  I lauged my arse off after reading that.  there are a ton of hit on google for "nobody cared" but they are all different.  Is there a way to report them and get help or at least make them known?
[04:10] <lullabud> jman_:  anything in the syslog?
[04:11] <lullabud> caffiend:  check the syslog and see if you see anything relating to it at the same time.  or try `dmesg`
[04:11] <khaije1> sloucher: df measures file systems not disks, is there a file system on it?
[04:11] <pianoboy3333> crimsun: if you get a moment, can you take a look at http://piano.juicemedia.tv/junk/alsaprobs <-- I can't make any sense of it, it all seems like mush to me, seems like it can't load/register some important modules? '...' is where I took out parts that didn't seem important
[04:11] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: There is also kverbos, but that is only for verb forms.
[04:11] <lullabud> sloucher:  `cfdisk /dev/sdb` or whatever the disk is.
[04:11] <floats> help
[04:11] <sloucher> khaije1, yes everything is on one partition
[04:12] <LjL> !helpme | floats
[04:12] <ubotu> floats: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:12] <Samin> floats, your cat is on fire ?:P
[04:12] <caffiend> lullabud: but it hangs in the install and I have to reboot.  would there be a syslog or dmsg if I reboot?
[04:12] <khaije1> sloucher: ^^ see lullabud?
[04:12] <sproingie> hm, i'm getting locale-related error messages: locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
[04:12] <sproingie> anyone know how to resolve that?
[04:12] <floats> ok thank you
[04:12] <floats> cat ?
[04:12] <sproingie> my LANG is en_US.UTF-8
[04:12] <sloucher> what's lullabud?
[04:12] <Intelligitimate> Anything else you would recommend, Jordan_U?
[04:12] <crimsun> sproingie: sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
[04:13] <lullabud> caffiend:  dmesg is cleared on reboot, but the syslog isn't.
[04:13] <sproingie> crimsun thanks :)
[04:13] <lullabud> sloucher:  i'm lullabud.
[04:13] <sloucher> oh
[04:13] <lullabud> sloucher:  and i said to try `cfdisk /dev/sdb`
[04:13] <kingace> hello, im trying to run a game and it's telling me that I need at least opengl 1.3 (i have 1.2 apparently). how would I go about upgrading it?
[04:13] <valehru> hey guys, I have some wmv files that won't play on my system....any pointers?
[04:13] <caffiend> lullabud: where would the syslog be stored?  That might help me out ALOT!
[04:14] <JohnM555> Whats the terminal command to shutdown?
[04:14] <sloucher> yeah, i did that but i don't want to format the disk - it's up and going and fine. I just want to see how much file space is left
[04:14] <LjL> JohnM555: shutdown :)
[04:14] <lullabud> caffiend:  /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages
[04:14] <fiveiron> ok, shouldn't there be a route configured by default to listen on port 67 for DHCP requests if I've got dhcpd running?
[04:14] <lullabud> sloucher:  it tells you at the top of that window.
[04:14] <caffiend> How to you enable univers and multivers repositories
[04:14] <JohnM555> Ljl: I tried that, but it says try 'shutdown --help' for more information :\

[04:14] <ubotu> JohnM555: The "man" command brings up the Linux manual pages for the command you're interested in. Try "man intro" at the command line, or see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[04:14] <lullabud> caffiend:  `vi /etc/apt/sources.lst` then :% s/^# //g
[04:15] <caffiend> lullabud: It doesn't even get that far :(  I might take some digi pics
[04:15] <rickyfingers> sudo shutdown -h now
[04:15] <lullabud> caffiend:  at least that's how i do it... but i rarely have a gui. :P
[04:15] <sproingie> argh.  i wish i could get ssh to switch my terminal background colors or something
[04:15] <lullabud> jman_:  huh?
[04:15] <sproingie> i keep typing stuff into a remote shell thinking it's a local one
[04:15] <valehru> khaijel, sorry if I wasnt clear, it says that the file is encrypted.  I already have the wmv codecs on my system.
=== neonak_ is now known as neonak
[04:15] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: I am looking for a .deb now, have you tried compiling from source?
[04:16] <Intelligitimate> Unsuccessfully.
[04:16] <kitche> JohnM555: did you try halt or shutdown -h now
[04:16] <JohnM555> kitche: I didn :\
[04:16] <jman_> lullabud: this is what I was reffering to:Hi I am having some problems running OpenOffice, whenever I go to launch it, it does nothing, I tried running through the terminal same results with no output in the terminal any ideas besides reinstalling?
[04:16] <lullabud> JohnM555:  i hate the shutdown command.  i always use `reboot` or `poweroff`
[04:16] <sproingie> actually .. how do i tell gnome-terminal to start up with a different profile?
[04:16] <jman_> their was nothing in syslog pertaining to that
[04:16] <jman_> just DHCP stuff
[04:16] <sproingie> from the CLI that is
[04:17] <nOnkeeEe> i got 6.10 installed and installed beryl and couldnt get themes to load. i restarted the system and not i get the ubuntu load screen then stays on a black screen.  no keys do anything
[04:17] <JohnM555> Ah I got it :P
[04:17] <lullabud> jman_:  ooooh, right.  um....  hmm....  i wonder if there's a verbose switch for OOO.
[04:17] <tonyyarusso> jman_: su to it?
[04:17] <caffiend> lullabud: pics with my camera of the text mode install on the monitor
[04:17] <caffiend> lullabud: how long u been using linux?
[04:17] <lullabud> caffiend:  um....
[04:17] <khaije1> valehru: not all wmv formats are playable, the newer ones don't have working codecs available iirc, if you can verify the files are good then i would check to see their version info
[04:17] <jman_> tonyyarusso, tried it nothing
[04:17] <lullabud> caffiend:  i forgot.  over 10 years.
[04:17] <sproingie> nvm, i read the nice help screen and found the rather verbose  --window-with-profile option
[04:18] <valehru> khaijel, k, thx
[04:18] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: What erros did you get, you probably just need some dependencies.
[04:18] <lullabud> caffiend:  i think the first linux i played with was redhat 4 or 5.
[04:18] <Intelligitimate> It has been a long time since I tried, Jordan.
[04:19] <Intelligitimate> I don't remember.
[04:19] <JohnM555> Now that there are some more people here, is there a way to reset all my wireless settings? I get errors trying to set my wep key now(on my eth2 interface) It used to work before(the wireless never has though. Doing iwconfig it doesn't even show that there is no key like it used to :\
[04:19] <nOnkeeEe> i got 6.10 installed and installed beryl and couldnt get themes to load. i restarted the system and not i get the ubuntu load screen then stays on a black screen.  no keys do anything. anyone have any ideas?
[04:19] <caffiend> lullabud: is the etc/apt/sources.list?  or .lst?    Also, I want to run a virtual server.  what's the best setup for that?
[04:19] <JohnM555> I'm just full of problems
[04:19] <lullabud> caffiend:  probably .list, whichever file exists there.
[04:19] <lullabud> caffiend:  i'd go with vmware for its portability.
[04:20] <JohnM555> I bet Ljl is sick of me, I'm on everyday asking for help :\
[04:20] <Imme> So is anyone in here using the usplash-switcher.c from Seveas ?
[04:20] <slavik> When I boot, I have GDM set to autolog me in ... when Gnome loads, X dies, after X restarts, I am presented with GDM screen, after logging in, everything works fine (X doesn't die). even if I set GDM to not auto log me in, X still dies the first time it is started ...
[04:21] <caffiend> lullabud: VMware, but what should I use for the base install? Is ubuntu server a good bet, or what would you reccommend.  I've used fedora too
[04:21] <TGPO> QEMU is more portable
[04:21] <lullabud> caffiend:  i love ubuntu for server shizz.  i'd definitely go with it.
[04:21] <slavik> caffiend: my experience with ubuntu and fc5 ... it doesn't matter ... it is all linux in the end ...
[04:22] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: Have you tried using wifi-radar or network-manager?
[04:22] <caffiend> lullabud: sorry for all the Q's, but you are the most knowledgeable and helpful person I've found here.  I really appreciate it
[04:22] <lullabud> TGPO:  QEMU is also more overhead.
[04:22] <slavik> caffiend: I feel insulted :P
[04:22] <lullabud> caffiend:  no problemo.  questions that are answerable are always nice.
[04:22] <lullabud> LOL
[04:22] <TGPO> lullabud, have you used it with the accelerator patch?
[04:22] <lullabud> TGPO:  i've used it on non-intel hardware. ;-)
[04:23] <JohnM555> Jordan: I've tried using wifi-radar, it never connects, I've tried using network-manager, but I have missing dependancies installing network-manager-gnome even though the dependancies are installed. Im cursed.
[04:23] <lullabud> TGPO:  er... non x86 hardware.
[04:23] <TGPO> lullabud I understood
[04:23] <caffiend> lullabud: slavik: u can tell I'm new to Linux.  I havea degree in MIS but want to migrate from MS to Linux.  What is a very good distro to learn to find a good paying job?
[04:23] <sproingie> does ubuntu server use the same kernel image as desktop?
[04:23] <JohnM555> If its matters...I', on an amd 64
[04:23] <dsnyders> Thanks to everyone who tried to help me fix my botched edgy eft upgrade.
[04:24] <lullabud> caffiend:  good paying job huh...  probably redhat.
[04:24] <johnny_> ello everyone
[04:24] <slavik> caffiend: you want to to Linux administration?
[04:24] <TGPO> caffiend, for the most part you need to speak RH
[04:24] <lullabud> caffiend:  but that could change.  it's like slavik said, it's all linux in the end.
[04:24] <sproingie> caffiend: redhat.  full stop.
[04:24] <segin> what is the windo manager theme used in kubuntu 6.06LTS?
[04:24] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: Try: "sudo apt-get -f install"
[04:25] <lullabud> segin:  i assume you mean "the version of the window manager..." ?
[04:25] <JohnM555> Jordan: No internet :(
[04:25] <segin> lullabud: No.
[04:25] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: :(
[04:25] <Jimbo> which codec pack is recommended for mp3 files?
[04:25] <lullabud> segin:  kubuntu is a KDE version of ubuntu.  KDE is the window manager.
[04:25] <Jimbo> total n00b here
[04:25] <JohnM555> Jordan_U: Exactly
[04:25] <segin> lullabud: I mean, what style did they use for the windowmanager (kwin)
[04:25] <sproingie> caffiend: download CentOS and you can learn RHEL that way (CentOS is RHEL with the names filed off)
[04:25] <slavik> lullabud: KDE is a desktop environment :P
[04:25] <Jordan_U> !restricted | Jimbo
[04:25] <ubotu> Jimbo: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:25] <lullabud> segin:  ah, that i don't know.
[04:25] <johnny_> what command would you use to uninstall a program or app from terminal?
[04:25] <lullabud> slavik:  is there a difference?
[04:26] <sloucher> I'm looking at my file system on edgy eft. There's no /etc/fstab? Where would you guess my sata hard drive is mounted?
[04:26] <segin> lullabud: I wanted to use that style on my gentoo system.
[04:26] <lullabud> johnny_:  apt-get remove
[04:26] <slavik> lullabud: a window manager does not have panels ;)
[04:26] <kitche> sproingie: umm oracle is closer to RHEL
[04:26] <sproingie> no fstab at all?  how do you even have a root filesystem
[04:26] <Jordan_U> johnny_: sudo apt-get remove <package>
[04:26] <whatthedeuce> I'm in the middle of compiling a new kernel, and I have to go.  How bad would it be if I halted midway through?
[04:26] <TGPO> sloucher look again
[04:26] <lullabud> slavik:  panels huh...  i see...
[04:26] <johnny_> kk tyty
[04:26] <caffiend> Thanks for the distro info!!
[04:26] <sproingie> kitche: it's also not free.  half price, yes, but not free
[04:26] <sloucher> lol, well it's there but empty? let me check again
[04:26] <segin> whatthedeuce: ^C halted?
[04:26] <lullabud> whatthedeuce:  just background it
[04:26] <kitche> sproingie: umm you can download oracle unbreakable for free what costs money is the support
[04:27] <lullabud> whatthedeuce:  ....and don't turn your system off or close the terminal window.
[04:27] <slavik> caffiend: the most important thing to understand about Linux is why there are distributions ... a distribution is like a base package. The differences are what comes installed by default and what tools are created by the distribution developers. Red Hat for example prides itself on creating GUI configuration tools, which make some things easier.
[04:27] <whatthedeuce> lullabud: I have to unplug the computer
[04:27] <sloucher> yeah, /etc/fstab is 0 size
[04:27] <lullabud> whatthedeuce:  oh.  well that sucks.
[04:27] <segin> whatthedeuce: if you used ^C to halt, just restart make and it'll pick up where it left off.
[04:27] <TGPO> kitche Oracle cant even keep their software patched, and now you want to try their linux?
[04:27] <lullabud> LOL
[04:27] <sproingie> kitche: "support" means downloading updates
[04:27] <LoRD_oF_ThE_WaR> What this menssage means? "Erro 17: Cannon mount selected partition..."
[04:28] <lullabud> TGPO:  that's true... i never thought about how awful an oracle distro of linux could be.
[04:28] <JohnM555> I'm going to reinstall ubuntu and start over. Do I need to uninstall Ubuntu first, or should just doing install from the live cd work?
[04:28] <whatthedeuce> segin: If I halt it, can I turn off the computer and pick up where I left off later?
[04:28] <kitche> TGPO: already tried it it's just RHEL with broken icons and such
[04:28] <slavik> Isn't Oracle the company that tried to push the windowslive type of thing?
[04:28] <sproingie> kitche: not being able to use up2date makes a RH distribution hard to work with
[04:28] <sloucher> by the way df / shows what i originally wanted
[04:28] <lullabud> JohnM555:  it'll ask you if you want to format the filesystems.  do so.
[04:28] <Jimbo> ill check those links later
[04:28] <JohnM555> lullabud: K
[04:28] <caffiend> slavik: I'm working through fedora 4 unleashed, Ubuntu Hacks, and Linux Phrasebook.  They seem to cover the bases.   FC4 was my cherry popper
[04:28] <slavik> JohnM555: what's the problem you are stuck at?
[04:28] <caffiend> :)
[04:28] <sproingie> slavik: i doubt oracle has ever pushed windows-ANYTHING
[04:28] <TGPO> kitche and if RH forks Oracle cant rip off their fixes
[04:28] <LoRD_oF_ThE_WaR> What this menssage means? "Erro 17: Cannon mount selected partition..."
[04:29] <sloucher> where would you guess a sata drive is? /dev/sda? /dev/sda1?
[04:29] <floats> I tried to intall  DISKNAME  Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft" on my Pentium 2, 128 mb ram, machine but the live
[04:29] <JohnM555> slavik: I can't get wireless working
[04:29] <caffiend> Is FC5 similar at all to RHEL?
[04:29] <TGPO> shoucher yes
[04:29] <sproingie> slavik: larry ellison hates microsoft with a seething passion
[04:29] <slavik> sproingie: I meant a system similar to what WindowsLive is doing ... the internet type of OS lots of people are talking about
[04:29] <lullabud> sloucher:  sata would be /dev/sd[a-z] 
[04:29] <kitche> TGPO: does that matter a fork that oracle made broke RH certify
[04:29] <JohnM555> slavik: I can't even see the option to set a wep key, I used to be able to. It gives me an error when I do try to set the key
[04:29] <lestat> what you think about suse and microsoft
[04:29] <slavik> JohnM555: what hardware chipset?
[04:29] <sproingie> slavik: he was one of the original "network computer" guys.  i think he's found sanity now, i haven't heard of him pushing anything like that lately
[04:29] <slavik> JohnM555: go ahead then ...
[04:30] <sproingie> oracle is perfectly free to fork redhat, that's their prerogative
[04:30] <JohnM555> slavik: I thinkg its a P something...Prims64? let me loook it up
[04:30] <sproingie> they just didn't do a very good job
[04:30] <floats> I tried to intall DISKNAME Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft" on my Pentium 2, 128 mb ram, machine but the live  CD method is too much for my machine, Is there another method or distro that would work bettker
[04:30] <WC`> When I try and bring my computer back from standby, I get a blank screen but ubuntu still running in the background. I can still input keyboard commands but can't see what i'm doing. I see a flicker of an error code before it goes into sleep mode. Any advice?
[04:30] <TGPO> kitche I'm just saying, playing with Oracle anything is a recipe for a head ache
[04:30] <Jimbo> can someone tell me what package to install from synaptic package manager so i can play mp3 files on this thing
[04:30] <JohnM555> slavik: Its a Netgear WG 121 USB Adapter installed via ndiswrapper
[04:30] <Jordan_U> sloucher: It goes /dev/sd[a-z drive letter] [1-whatever partition number] 
[04:30] <slavik> JohnM555: that's a nicely supported chipset :)
[04:30] <Jimbo> i got other things to do besides hunt for info
[04:30] <Intelligitimate> Jordan_U, here is what the terminal says when I try to install it.
[04:30] <Xenguy> lestat: I think they should both be boycotted -- now =)
[04:30] <sproingie> TGPO: i hear they make a decent databse
[04:30] <snoops> WC` the alternative cd..it's a text based installer
[04:30] <crimsun> Jimbo: for what player(s)?
[04:30] <Intelligitimate> http://pastebin.com/821624
[04:30] <kitche>  TGPO: so it's just like RH to a point at least FC works good
[04:30] <JohnM555> slavik: I think I'm just cursed :P
[04:30] <slavik> JohnM555: I would suggest trying to get it working in native mode
[04:31] <caffiend> lullabud: u ever frequent forums or help good guys out in email?  I'm a good learner, just get stuck on som undocumented stuff..
[04:31] <Jimbo> whatever came with ubuntu
[04:31] <Acu> I would like to connect to a network trough vpn: I know I have to change a file called vpnc.conf - this is my first problem - the file is not in /etc/vpnc.conf - I found it in /usr/share/doc/vpnc/examples which confuses me
[04:31] <sloucher> ok thanks I still didn't find it but I have to leave
[04:31] <JohnM555> slavik: I don't know if thats the actual chipset, how would I find out?
[04:31] <WC`> snoop: eh?
[04:31] <Jimbo> i just want to get some tunes goin here while i figure this stuff out
[04:31] <thor> Jimbo: xmms will play mp3s
[04:31] <Acu> second: how to start vpn ?
[04:31] <WC`> I've installed ubuntu just fine
[04:31] <fire> can anyone help : where are gnome/gdm startup scripts and how can I debug gnome session errors
[04:31] <TGPO> sproingie, their db is full of bugs that havent been patched in the 2 years since they were reported
[04:31] <snoops> ah sorry WC`.. wrong person
[04:31] <slavik> JohnM555: in terminal 'lspci' and pastebin the result
[04:31] <lullabud> caffiend:  nah, i don't participate much in the ubuntu community other than here in irc.
[04:31] <WC`> No problem
[04:31] <slavik> !pastebin
[04:31] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[04:31] <floats> I tried to intall DISKNAME Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft" on my Pentium 2, 128 mb ram, machine but the live CD method is too much for my machine, Is there another method or distro that would work better?
[04:31] <snoops> floats try the alternative cd. It's a text based installer..so no live cd
[04:31] <JohnM555> slavik: OK
[04:31] <sproingie> TGPO: all databases are.  you think mysql is the pinnacle of engineering or something?
[04:32] <Jimbo> is that already on ubuntu..cus a minute ago i got a message sayin wrong codec or something to that effect
[04:32] <floats> alternative C
[04:32] <crimsun> Jimbo: enable universe, and install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
[04:32] <LoRD_oF_ThE_WaR> What this menssage means? "Erro 17: Cannon mount selected partition..."
[04:32] <floats> alternative cd is the name?
[04:32] <Jimbo> ok
[04:32] <crimsun> Jimbo: I presume you're using Ubuntu & GNOME?
[04:32] <TGPO> sproingie, nope, just that it gets patches and fixes on a more regular basis
[04:32] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: You said you are using 64 bit ubuntu right, did you use the 64 bit RPM ?
[04:32] <snoops> yep, alternative is in the name floating
[04:32] <Jimbo> i think gstreamers are already unstalled but ill double check
[04:32] <snoops> instead of desktop
[04:32] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: If there is one that is.
[04:32] <Intelligitimate> No. I don't have a 64 bit processor.
[04:32] <fire> how to debug gnome session errors (or reset to default) ?
[04:32] <Intelligitimate> This is an old Pentium 3.
[04:33] <Jimbo> crimson...where do i enable universe?
[04:33] <Jordan_U> Intelligitimate: Sorry, got you confused with somebody else :)
[04:33] <crimsun> Jimbo: in Synaptic
[04:33] <Jimbo> first day on linux here

[04:36] <JohnM555> slavik: Yay, Maybe its the thing in line 17?
[04:36] <kitche> sid: does Creative use a database for that?
[04:36] <lullabud> caffiend:  i'm in here from day to day.  in here and in #sugarcrm
[04:36] <sproingie> floats: if you have a really old machine, you could try arch linux, it's supposed to be pretty lightweight
[04:36] <slavik> that's a winmodem ... doesn't look like a wifi card to me ...
[04:36] <nessmuk> I have a Microsoft Ballpoint Mouse which is not recognized in 6.06, and I see nothing in the forums. Now trying a fresh install of 6.06 on a spare hd to see if it's recognized on install. Wondering where to ask for help in the forums
[04:36] <JohnM555> slavik: I swear its pluged in, its lit up
[04:36] <lullabud> caffiend:  the guys in #sugarcrm know me, in case you want to get ahold of me.
[04:36] <slavik> JohnM555: do 'lsmod | grep ndiswrapper' and tell me if it gives you anything
[04:36] <lullabud> caffiend:  anyhow, i'm out man.  nice chatting with you.
[04:36] <Jordan_U> JohnM555: Is it USB?
[04:36] <Jimbo> brb

[04:38] <JohnM555> (I didn't pastebin it because I have to copy it to a textfile, transfer it to this comp, open it then copy it)
[04:38] <sproingie> Imme: it seems to have a few problems.  dapper is the LTS version, it's bound to stay more stable
[04:39] <JohnM555> There is one other thing in the list, which is my mouse/keyboard
[04:39] <Jimbo> what does this mean     warnings.warn("apt API not stable yet", FutureWarning)
[04:39] <caffiend> anyone know how to copy a "symbolic link"?  it is on my Iso Mount of a Ubuntu install, all copied perfect except that :(
[04:39] <crimsun> Jimbo: nothing relevant
[04:39] <johnny_> does anyone know if hddtemp ot lm-sensors conflict with Beta Graphics Driver (NVIDIA)?
[04:39] <sproingie> Imme: freetype in edgy was quite screwy for example.  it still isn't perfect
[04:40] <thor> caffiend: you probably won't be able to copy that...you will have to recreate it.
[04:40] <Imme> sproingie, kitche: Thanks for the info... So I need not upgrade to Edgy...
[04:40] <rickyfingers> caffiend: you  need to create the sym link in the files system before you create the image
[04:40] <Jordan_U> slavik: I don't know anything about setting up USB wireless adapters so you are on your own with John
[04:40] <Jimbo> k
[04:40] <JohnM555> Slavik: The lsmod | grep ndiswrapper isn't showing anything, but it did befire, I'll try to do the mod thing to get it to show again
[04:40] <sproingie> caffiend: cp -d
[04:41] <Jimbo> crimson what was that player again...x something or other?
[04:41] <floats> What is the Ubuntu distro designed for the older  pentium 2, 128 mb machines?
[04:41] <JohnM555> Slavik: Doing ndiswrapper shows netwg121 driver installed, hardare present
[04:41] <Jordan_U> floats: Xubuntu
[04:41] <tonyyarusso> xubuntu or fluxbuntu
[04:41] <rickyfingers> John: then just modprobe ndiswrapper
[04:41] <JohnM555> ricky: Just did that
[04:42] <teenprogrammer> how do i set a script to run everytime someone logs in?
[04:42] <rickyfingers> and lsmod doesn't show ndiswrapper?
[04:42] <JohnM555> ricky: Oh, it does now
[04:42] <rickyfingers> then iwconfig
[04:42] <rickyfingers> to put in ssid wep key , etc.
[04:42] <Jordan_U> teenprogrammer: System, preferences, sessions
[04:42] <teenprogrammer> um
[04:43] <teenprogrammer> in console
[04:43] <JohnM555> ricky: However I don't think it fixed my problem, doing iwconfig I can see the eth2 interface as being the wireless one(Its the only thing without the no wireless extensions) but it doesnt even say that no key exists
[04:43] <Imme> !usplash
[04:43] <ubotu> usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[04:43] <rickyfingers> teen: you need to modify .profile for user
[04:43] <JohnM555> ricky: Thats my problem, I used to get Encryption key: off, or some variation of that, but now it doesn't even list that
[04:43] <floats> jordan and tonyyarrusso:  thank you
[04:43] <rickyfingers> John try iwconfig ethwhatever key 0934875328907t89re
[04:44] <teenprogrammer> #freebsd
[04:44] <teenprogrammer> oops
[04:44] <teenprogrammer> lol
[04:44] <rickyfingers> know what I'm saying, ethwhatever should be what interface your wnic is
[04:44] <caffiend> thor: rickyfingers: sproingie: muchas gracias!!
[04:44] <rickyfingers> caffiend: denada
[04:44] <teenprogrammer> ok, thanks! adios
[04:44] <Tokenbad> is there a way to monitor a video cards gpu core temp in ubuntu?
[04:44] <scubes13> looking for some guidance on getting an atheros wlan nic working under fresh install of edgy (currently displays as "ath0" under ifconfig, but cant scan for a network nor get any connection)
[04:44] <scubes13> anyone available that can assist?
[04:45] <JohnM555> Ricky: I get an error doing that with my key
[04:45] <rickyfingers> what's the error?
[04:45] <Jordan_U> !sensors | Tokenbad
[04:45] <ubotu> Tokenbad: You might find something useful at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto
[04:45] <JohnM555> Ricky: It says 'Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : SET failed on device eth2 ; Unknown error 524.'
[04:46] <khaije1> scubes13: i'm using one at home (at work now) what problem are you having?
[04:46] <WC`> Is there a way to make it so that you have to enter your password after coming out of standby or hibernate mode?
[04:46] <rickyfingers> oh, try putting sudo in front
[04:46] <JohnM555> ricky: I did :\
[04:46] <caffiend> rickyfingers: the image was downloaded, mounted on the drive and then copied to a USB drive.  I used cp -Rav and it did everything except the symbolic link.  Since the files are there, can it still be copied over to it with cp -d?
[04:46] <caffiend> thor: how would one re-create it?
[04:46] <roler> what program can I use to view video from my camcorder / firewire using /dev/raw1394
[04:47] <rickyfingers> cripes! r u  putting in the key with 16/26 hex digits?
[04:47] <khaije1> scubes13: also what is the output when you type 'route' into terminal
[04:47] <JohnM555> ricky: 10
[04:47] <rickyfingers> caffiend, don't know for sure but, try cp -rRp
[04:47] <noxxle> how can i make qsynaptics startup with my desktop?
[04:47] <noxxle> right now i have to type qsynaptics in the terminal every session
=== Alpha3 is now known as sCsI
[04:48] <JohnM555> ricky: I think 10 is normal though
[04:48] <snoops> how can I see how hard a hard drive is working - transfering/copying at etc?
[04:48] <rickyfingers> John, not sure but I think it's got to be 16 or 26 hex digits
[04:48] <caffiend> off topic.. anyonw know of a good computer building channel, for tech support or just getting opinions?
[04:48] <JohnM555> ricky: Making it 16 still gives me the error, I don't think thats the problem
[04:48] <rickyfingers> try padding zeros on beginning or end of key
[04:48] <khaije1> noxxle: ln -s /path/to/app ~/.kde/Autostart (create symbolic link in autostart dir, please verfiy the paths first)
[04:48] <JohnM555> ricky: I wish there was a way to just reset all wireless interfaces and settings
[04:49] <madman91> caffiend: im no expert// but i had a few good answers in #hardware
[04:49] <noxxle> im not using kde
[04:49] <caffiend> madman91: thanks!
[04:49] <madman91> caffiend, good luck with that :)
[04:49] <rickyfingers> John - I think you could just rmmod ndiswrapper, then modprobe again
[04:49] <khaije1> noxxle: why use qsynaptics then?
[04:49] <WC`> Is there a way to make it so that you have to enter your password after coming out of standby or hibernate mode?
[04:50] <rickyfingers> but that's disturbing that it won't let you set a key
[04:50] <noxxle> its for gnome
[04:50] <noxxle> ksynaptics is kde
[04:50] <JohnM555> ricky: It really is!
[04:50] <slavik> When I boot, I have GDM set to autolog me in ... when Gnome loads, X dies, after X restarts, I am presented with GDM screen, after logging in, everything works fine (X doesn't die). even if I set GDM to not auto log me in, X still dies the first time it is started ...
[04:50] <scubes13> khaije1: sent inf to you via IM/PM
[04:51] <rickyfingers> sure you're typing in sudo iwconfig eth2 key 1234567890123456
[04:51] <Poromenos> what's a good bittorrent client?
[04:51] <caffiend> last Q 4 the night, to run a Virtual server/virt host what release of ubuntu is best suited for the "base" install?
[04:51] <rickyfingers> substituting that for your real key
[04:51] <Daro> !hcf
[04:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hcf - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:51] <Daro> !conexant
[04:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about conexant - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:51] <JohnM555> ricky: Yes, I'm sure
[04:52] <khaije1> noxxle: oic, i just use synaptic, there should be an option under the admin menu - i'm not sure off the top of my head
[04:52] <sizzam> is there a command to see what my peak memory usage was for the day?
[04:52] <rickyfingers> Then I'm out of ideas, unless ndiswrapper isn't really wrapping the windows drivers correctly.
[04:52] <slavik> time to go, have fun everyone
[04:52] <Poromenos> what's a good linux bittorrent client?
[04:52] <rickyfingers> You can try different versions out of sourceforge
[04:52] <JohnM555> ricky: Well thanks, I think I'm just going to reinstall ubuntu
[04:52] <caffiend> anyone use #phpbb?  that channel sucks.  can't even get an answer about how to add users
[04:53] <JohnM555> Ricky: Because I used to have the option to set the key
[04:53] <JohnM555> It jus disapeared
[04:53] <sid> Nov 10 22:50:28 bluebox kernel: [17214720.860000]  usb 4-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3
[04:53] <sid> Which /dev/??? is that?
[04:53] <rickyfingers> caffiend: useradd
[04:53] <Jordan_U> Poromenos: If you don't mind the bloat, Azureus
[04:53] <JohnM555> poromenos, I used to use utorrent, I don't know if it works with ubuntu
[04:53] <Poromenos> Jordan_U: gah :(
[04:53] <Poromenos> JohnM555: it doesn't :(
[04:53] <JohnM555> (or linux)
[04:53] <JohnM555> Poro: Then I'm gonna need a new one when I get my internet working :P
[04:53] <Jordan_U> Poromenos: I have heard that utorrent can be run in wine
[04:53] <Poromenos> JohnM555: indeed :)
[04:54] <Poromenos> Jordan_U: a friend has tried and i don't think it runs very well
[04:54] <Jordan_U> Poromenos: Ubuntu comes with a lightweight one, I believe it is the official bittorrent
[04:55] <JohnM555> Poro: Isn't there one that comes with ubuntu?
[04:55] <JohnM555> What he said
[04:55] <Poromenos> let me check
[04:55] <tuko> anyone here uses slmodemd, with alsa ?
[04:55] <WC`> Can someone tell me the opposite of the killall command?
[04:55] <Poromenos> no, not that i can find
[04:55] <Poromenos> WC`: startall? :P
[04:55] <jrib> WC`: what do you want that command to do?
[04:55] <Jordan_U> WC`: What do you mean by that? Can you refrase the question.
[04:56] <WC`> Well
[04:56] <WC`> I was doing some troubleshooting and used the command "sudo killall gnome-screensaver"
[04:56] <WC`> I want to reverse the effect of that command
[04:56] <caffiend> rickyfingers: thanks, but in my admin panel there is no useradd there. I've gone through the whole admin menus and ther eis nothing about adding.  do I have to install a module?  It isn't in the "User Admin" section
[04:56] <Jordan_U> WC`: gnome-screensaver
[04:57] <jrib> heh there should be a 'resurrect' command
[04:57] <Jordan_U> WC`: killall quits an application, so the opposite of: killall application , it simply to start that application again.
[04:57] <Tokenbad> Jordan_U, thanks but still not see my video card temp
[04:58] <rickyfingers> jordan killall -HUP
[04:58] <WC`> Thanks very much for that, I now have a workaround for my standby problem :D
[04:58] <rickyfingers> restarts in stead of just killing
[04:58] <fatlip> where's PKG_CONFIG_PATH located?
[04:58] <jrib> fatlip: what are you trying to compile?
[04:58] <rickyfingers> fatlip sounds like an environment variable
[04:58] <rickyfingers> do env | grep PKG
[04:58] <fatlip> if i answer that quesiton i'm going to be redirected to another channel ;)
[04:58] <rickyfingers> do see if it's set if not
[04:59] <fatlip> nothing returns
[04:59] <rickyfingers> then you need to set it
[04:59] <neonak> I just installed Edgy, but now my Ethernet card doesn't seem to get an IP adres from the router (DHCP). I tried resetting the router, and tried dhclient. But still can't get it to work. Does anyone have a clue?
[04:59] <fatlip> how do i go about that
[04:59] <rickyfingers> PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/some/directory/on/your/system
[04:59] <fatlip> =]  thanks
[04:59] <rickyfingers> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
[04:59] <rickyfingers> don't forget about the export
[04:59] <cwill1> I'm trying to install dapper/edgy from the livecd or the alternative cd, but it won't resize the ntfs partition.  It doesn't give a visible error, it just doesn't do it. Help!
=== fiveiron_ is now known as fiveiron
[05:00] <neonak> Maybe it can't resize NTFS partitions?
[05:00] <jimb1> i loaded all the gstreamer stuff from synaptic and i still cant play a freakin mp3
[05:00] <jimb1> what do i need?
[05:00] <Jordan_U> neonak: It can
[05:01] <rickyfingers> jimbl xmms?
[05:01] <cwill1> Jordan_U: do I need to defrag under windows first or something?
[05:01] <jimb1> ricky: xmms...would that be in synaptic also?
=== cw_asmara is now known as cewe_alim
[05:01] <Jordan_U> cwill1: I don't think so, but I don't use windows so I don't know for sure.
[05:01] <rickyfingers> jimbl si si
[05:02] <jimb1> do i need xmms-dev also?
[05:02] <jimb1> i found them in synaptic
[05:02] <cwill1> !install
[05:02] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[05:02] <rickyfingers> jimlb, just started installing it myself. depends, r u  planning on doing some programming using xmms source code?
[05:03] <caffiend> rickyfingers: can you take a look an see if I'm overlooking the addusers?  I'll let you login as admin
[05:03] <jimb1> no for now just want to be able to play mp3 files
[05:03] <rickyfingers> I'd rather not log in to your system caff
[05:03] <Jordan_U> cwill1: It is kind of strage to say that the installer doesn't resize it but doesn't give any errors, can you give some screenshots from the liveCD or a more detailed account?
[05:04] <rickyfingers> caff I'm finding a web page for you now...
[05:05] <snoops> how can I see the permissions of a file in terminal?
[05:05] <snoops> as well as user and owner
[05:05] <snoops> and group*
[05:05] <rickyfingers> snoops too easy, use chmod
[05:05] <cwill1> Jordan_U: after the automated partitioning or a manual partition, it grinds for a couple seconds, and then says it couldn't find enough free space (there's 120 gigs free on the 160 gig drive);  the alternate cd just grinds for a second or two and then returns to the partitioning menu, without changing the partition's size.  There's a fat32 partition before it that I can resize (it's only a couple gigs) fine though
[05:05] <jimb1> got it working....thanx
[05:06] <rickyfingers> caff, just do useradd <username>
[05:06] <rickyfingers> then passwd <username>
[05:06] <rickyfingers> oh and put sudo in front
[05:06] <madman91> i cant mount my /dev/hda2 ... my mount statement looks like this ...   (( mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/oldroot -t ext3   ))
[05:06] <snoops> rickyfingers, yes..for changing the permissions, but what about listing the current permissions
[05:06] <madman91> it says its busy or already mounted
[05:07] <rickyfingers> ls -la
[05:07] <rickyfingers> snoops
[05:07] <neonak> snoops: try ls -al
[05:07] <snoops> great, that's what I needed, thanks
[05:07] <caffiend> rickyfingers: understood.  does addusers come default?  what is it in under the admin menu?  The users only has banning, management, dissallow, etc.  Could it be a script I need?
[05:08] <rickyfingers> caff, yes, adduser does a little more for setting up account
[05:13] <Davo_Dinkum2> Hello.
[05:13] <rickyfingers> useradd puts line in /etc/passwd
[05:13] <rickyfingers> but then you have to create home dir &c by hand
[05:13] <Toma-> is there a gui editor for fstab? plz, i know gedit is a laugh, but i need something a bit more automated
[05:13] <Jordan_U> cwill1: Try using the gparted liveCD perhaps ( it uses the same application as Ubuntu but is more up to date / focused entirely on gparted so likely more reliable )
[05:13] <rickyfingers> toma, ever try x-emacs?
[05:13] <rickyfingers> you can automate anything you want
[05:13] <rickyfingers> with that program
[05:13] <rickyfingers> but it's kind of like a swiss army knife with all the blades sticking out
[05:13] <mistform> anyone here use initNG????
[05:13] <mistform> I tried setting it up but it failed to boot the GUI
[05:13] <jimb1> will linux recognise m3u files?
[05:13] <Toma-> yeh... i re-ordered and resized and deleted a bunch of partition, now ive lost all my drives
[05:13] <mistform> jimb1, I had an m3u file, but I never tried to play it or anything
[05:13] <rapt501> hi
[05:13] <Samin> jimb1, isn't those just text files with song names in it?
[05:13] <Toma-> jimb1: gstreamer will and xmms will
[05:13] <rapt501> question
[05:13] <sproingie> rickyfingers: xemacs is kind of dead-ended development-wise.  fsf emacs is really what you want these days
[05:13] <jimb1> mist...m3u is a playlist
[05:13] <rapt501> does everybody's google video work
[05:13] <rapt501> on their ubuntu
[05:13] <jimb1> k
[05:13] <mistform> I just use .p.s
[05:13] <jimb1> i got xmms workin
[05:13] <mistform> .pls***
[05:13] <cwill1> Jordan_U: read my mind :);  oh well, here's hoping
[05:13] <Samin> jimb1, rename it to .pls and load it in xmms beep-media-player,  heck even "mplayer -pls foo.m3u" should do it
[05:13] <yertman_usa> Anyone running ubuntu on older (400Mhz) iMac? Is performance okay with wmaker. Does modem work?
[05:13] <mistform> nope
[05:13] <mistform> not me
[05:13] <yertman_usa> Thanks.
[05:13] <jimb1> Samin:i havent transfered any to this box yet
[05:13] <jimb1> first day on linux
[05:13] <rickyfingers> last linux i used w/ imac was yellow dog
[05:13] <jimb1> all stuff is still on the windows boxes
[05:13] <Toma-> yertman_usa: no, but id say it should all work.
[05:13] <Samin> jimb1, oh I see
[05:13] <fowlduck> On the ubuntu guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/ch04s10.html
[05:13] <fowlduck> it mentions the 'commercial' repository
[05:13] <fowlduck> what's this?
[05:13] <jimb1> kinda confused yet
[05:13] <Jordan_U> rickyfingers: I have experience with Ubuntu on PPC, who is asking about it?
[05:13] <yertman_usa> Me
[05:13] <rapt501> can anyone explain why the sound doesn't work with google video?
[05:13] <rickyfingers> yertman_usa
[05:13] <fowlduck> !commercial
[05:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about commercial - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:13] <Samin> rapt501, you have the right flash plugin installed?
[05:14] <yertman_usa> I have an older iMac I want to setup for web browsing and email for grandma.
[05:14] <rapt501> yeah
[05:14] <yertman_usa> seriously
[05:14] <rapt501> it will show the video but not play the sound
[05:14] <rapt501> sometimes
[05:14] <jimb1> how do you make playlists for a group of mp3 files in linux?
[05:14] <rapt501> sometimes the sound works
[05:14] <jimb1> dont spose its easy
[05:14] <rapt501> but its like flipping a coin
[05:15] <Jordan_U> yertman_usa: I have a clamshell iMac running XFCE, wmaker should be fine, I couldn't get the modem to work though, all though I didn't try very hard.
[05:15] <rapt501> you find out if the sound works on google video when you turn on the computer
[05:15] <yertman_usa> thanks. I will try it tonight. I will have to get the modem to work thou as she has dial up.
[05:15] <Toma-> jimb1: make a playlist with xmms and save the playlist...?
[05:16] <yertman_usa> Jordan_u How much RAM does your clamshell have?
[05:16] <jimb1> it appears you can only load one file at a time in xmms
[05:16] <Jordan_U> yertman_usa: 128 I think.
[05:16] <rickyfingers> u can add a whole dir
[05:17] <yertman_usa> Sweet. I think that is what this one has.
=== BunnyKitten is now known as _Er1K_
[05:17] <jimb1> you can?
[05:17] <rapt501> so can anyone help with the sound problem
[05:17] <Toma-> jimb1: hold the button down on the + sign
[05:17] <Jordan_U> yertman_usa: There is a mac specific forum on ubuntuforums FYI, might search there about the modem.
[05:17] <jrib> ubotu: tell rapt501 about flash
[05:18] <jrib> rapt501: either follow the instructions on the wiki for using aoss with flash or try flash beta9
[05:18] <Toma-> time to install nvidia-9629 :>
[05:18] <rickyfingers> jimbl, right click on top of xmms window
[05:18] <rickyfingers> select playlist editor
[05:18] <jimb1> hold down + on the key pad while adding files to xmms..?
[05:19] <yertman_usa> Jordan_U Thanks for the tip. :)
[05:19] <Toma-> jimb1: no, the + sign on the playlist editor
[05:19] <jimb1> ricky: i see it now
[05:19] <jimb1> thanx
[05:19] <rapt501> ok so switch the flash
[05:19] <rapt501> thank you
[05:19] <jrib> ubotu: tell rapt501 about flash9
[05:20] <Jordan_U> yertman_usa: np, it has been really hard for me to find help with PPC specific stuff anywhere but on ubuntuforums
[05:24] <roler> how can I view/save firewire 1394 video ?

[05:28] <Jordan_U> !offtopic
[05:28] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[05:28] <wweasel> Yeah, yeah. We know. But it's quiet!!!! :P
[05:28] <Jordan_U> :)
[05:29] <jperez> and, so wweasel what you nned about grep?
[05:29] <Jordan_U> Come to think of it I have never seen it this quiet in here before
[05:29] <Jordan_U> The gnome power applet thinks I am still connected to my power supply when my laptop is on battery power so when it runsout of battery my computer shuts down from loss of power instead of shutting down correctly.
[05:29] <wweasel> Jordan_U: I know, it's odd.
[05:29] <neonak> Jordan_U maybe you can help me.. I sort of have this problem: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=287026&highlight=via+ethernet
[05:29] <Kenotic> does any one know why beagled eats 100% of CPU after my machine is up for a day or two?
[05:29] <mluser-home> How does one go about booting into runstate 3 on ubuntu?
[05:30] <neonak> But even setting a static address won't help
[05:30] <AsheD> anybody know the link to that time-lapse video of a model getting her picture made up for a billboard?
[05:30] <tonyyarusso> mluser-home: 'sudo init 3' should do it
[05:30] <mluser-home> tonyyarusso: thanks.. will it come up that way after every boot though?
[05:30] <wweasel> jperez: Well, I've been using ubuntu for a while, and I knew that I absolutely should know about cat and grep, but didn't. So I finally decided to look them up. Cat is simple. Grep is mindblowing, what with escaped parentheses and periods and question marks...wow.
[05:30] <tonyyarusso> mluser-home: no
[05:31] <equilibrium> mluser-home: you need to set the default run level in /etc/inittab for that
[05:31] <mluser-home> equilibrium: thanks :)
[05:31] <eetfunk> how do i delete a user from the commandline?
[05:31] <jperez> hello, rapunzel... where you come from?
[05:31] <equilibrium> userdel
[05:35] <wweasel> jperez: rapunzel is from Indonesia
[05:35] <dks_matt> hi there is anyone available?
[05:35] <dks_matt> i could use some help
[05:36] <wweasel> jperez: and where are you from?
[05:36] <wweasel> !ask
[05:36] <Jordan_U> dks_matt: Lots of people
[05:36] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:36] <tonyyarusso> dks_matt: Just ask your question and see who knows
[05:36] <dks_matt> ok cool
[05:36] <dks_matt> I'm having a problem with my soudn card
[05:36] <jperez> I am from colombia
[05:36] <dks_matt> sound*
[05:36] <dks_matt> I've disabled my onboard sound
[05:37] <dks_matt> and I have an audigy 2 in there
[05:37] <roler> Jordan_U, ; thanks!
[05:37] <Ubootno> hello?
[05:39] <dks_matt> when the login screen comes up I get the sound, but after that I can't get any sound anywhere
[05:41] <wweasel> dks_matt: Well, you gotta stop using mute! :P (Just kidding)
[05:41] <dks_matt> if only
[05:41] <wweasel> dks_matt: Though I would be sure to check PCM in the volume control
[05:41] <jperez> hello everybody i am new in this chat site
[05:41] <Falstius> does anyone know what package has the 'xv' picture viewer in it?
[05:41] <dks_matt> its odd I had issues with it while the onboard was still enabled, but by changing between card in system-preferences-sound i could get most things to work
[05:41] <dks_matt> PCM
[05:41] <dks_matt> in alsamixer or the gui?
[05:41] <jperez> does anyone know how install the totem or any other video server to ubuntu?
[05:41] <fiveiron> anyone using a Broadcom wireless card (probably in a laptop) ?   I'm trying to follow the tuts online, but none of the windows drivers work for me through ndiswrapper
[05:41] <NineTeen67Comet> Hi all .. looking for a little advice .. Got my this old 450mhz PIIi/128MB ram/Nvidia NV4 AGP machine, It runs "okay" but not well. Would tossing in 256MB more ram help it enough to be worth it? My mom uses this for paperwork, printing, e-mail and the internet.
[05:41] <aeread> anyone here runnin exaile? im gettin some libatk dependency failure, even tho libatk is installed >.<
[05:41] <dks_matt> hang on, I just typed alsa mixed and got this: "alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[05:41] <dks_matt> "
[05:41] <Ubootno> NineTeen67Comet, not if you have to buy the ram
[05:41] <Ubootno> NineTeen67Comet, if you have to buy anything for it, forget it
[05:41] <Jordan_U> NineTeen67Comet: What WM are you using?
[05:41] <Ubootno> its too old to be worth spending money on
[05:42] <Ubootno> NineTeen67Comet, if you already HAVE the ram for it, itll help but you'd still be better off using xubuntu on that thing
[05:42] <ex_> How do I make my mouse hardware acclerated?.. I have an s3 unichrome via card, and when I follow this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome it "works" but the mouse pointer disapears in apps in firefox and Wine.
[05:42] <bsnider> having trouble getting a hauppauge remote control to be recognized as an input device
[05:42] <NineTeen67Comet> Jordan_U: I'm in Gnome currently (she's VERY NOT into switching from MS's stuff) .. I thought about KDE but I've always had more resources spend on that WM (desktop manager) than Gnome (I tossed xubuntu on here too, but she hated it)...
[05:43] <bsnider> has anybody got a hauppauge remote control working right now?
[05:43] <wweasel> NineTeen67Comet: That's a fairly old computer, and that will choke on most things. Adding some RAM will help.
[05:43] <wweasel> bsnider: Not me, but I know for sure that people use them,
[05:44] <Ubootno> NineTeen67Comet, seriously man - you want to be looking at xubuntu
[05:44] <c0re^> hey, anyone have a link to ubuntu with the new kernel that supports asus p5b?
[05:44] <NineTeen67Comet> wweasel: I tossed ram in my father in laws box (a 1ghz PIII) and it woke it right up .. I just wasn't sure about a 450 seeing results .. it dips into swap pretty heavy as it is ..
[05:44] <c0re^> i desperately want to run it.
[05:44] <wweasel> NineTeen67Comet: Well, if it is dipping into swap, RAM will help. Nothing will make that dying bird fly like an eagle though.
[05:44] <NineTeen67Comet> Ubootno: Got it installed .. lol .. I use and can handle it, but she get's a little freeked ..
[05:44] <jperez> Some body here study quantum mechanics?
[05:45] <Ubootno> NineTeen67Comet, yeah the Gui is too intense for it - you'd be better off on Xubuntu, with a much "lighter weight" gui in place
[05:45] <NineTeen67Comet> wweasel: yeah figured that much .. Just needs to run well enough for her to use it for simple stuff ..
[05:45] <Jordan_U> NineTeen67Comet: You could try enlightemnent gnome, it will look a little different but it will function like gnome ( because it is )
[05:45] <wweasel> NineTeen67Comet: Well, it's a trade off. Gnome will look better, run slower. XFCE would def. run faster. Looks uglier though
[05:46] <c0re^> Is there a ubuntu with the 2.6.18 kernel precompiled and ready to install?
[05:46] <Ubootno> not too much uglier
[05:46] <dks_matt> is there a config file that determines which sound card things like alsa and gstreamer use?
[05:46] <Ubootno> c0re^, fedora is
[05:46] <c0re^> i know
[05:46] <c0re^> i dont want fedora :(
[05:46] <c0re^> i want UBUNTU
[05:46] <NineTeen67Comet> I'll work on getting Xubuntu "looking" a little better for her .. toss common stuff places she "knows" to look and such ..
[05:46] <Ubootno> so bust yourself out a custom kernel
[05:46] <jperez> what about SuSE?
[05:46] <c0re^> plus fedora wouldnt install, and it wouldnt let me partition
[05:47] <c0re^> suse? ill look into it
[05:47] <Ubootno> c0re^, thats not good
[05:47] <c0re^> it didnt let me resize my ntfs
[05:47] <c0re^> so i couldnt make a new one
[05:47] <Ubootno> ahh well ubuntu'll definitely do that
[05:47] <c0re^> yeah i know..
[05:47] <rjgonza> sup guys
[05:47] <Ubootno> but if you want a bleeding edge kernel you're SOL
[05:48] <NineTeen67Comet> thanks all . off to clean up and sleep up ..
[05:48] <Ubootno> the kernel is solid and relatively recent though
[05:48] <Ubootno> hell centos is using 2.6.9 still
[05:48] <c0re^> awesome
[05:49] <c0re^> suse 10.2 uses 2.6.1.8.2
[05:49] <c0re^> which is newer than what i wanted
[05:49] <Paladine> I hate kernel upgrades
[05:49] <c0re^> yeah well i cant boot linux without it
[05:49] <Paladine> I have to recompile so much stuff everytime I upgrade my kernel
[05:49] <Paladine> itis annoying
[05:49] <c0re^> jmicron sata controller
[05:50] <tonyyarusso> I have instructions saying to edit /etc/modprobe.conf, which doesn't exist.  Should I create it or is there another name for it on Ubuntu?
[05:50] <aeread> anyone here runnin exaile? im gettin some libatk dependency failure, even tho libatk is installed >.<
[05:51] <Paladine> you sure it doesn't say edit /etc/modules
[05:51] <dks_matt> is there a way to find out if the drivers for my sound card are installed?
=== _Er1K_ is now known as SexyTeenGirl
[05:51] <tonyyarusso> Paladine: Yep.
[05:51] <tonyyarusso> Paladine: for adding aliases
=== SexyTeenGirl is now known as _Er1K_
[05:52] <bsnider> what's the command to continuously watch dmesg output?
[05:52] <Paladine> aliases are in modules.d I think
[05:52] <Paladine> let me check
[05:52] <Paladine> modprobe.d even
[05:52] <c0re^> anyone know where i can find suse mirrors?
[05:52] <Paladine> yeah they are in /etc/modprobe.d
[05:52] <humblerodent> okay so
[05:52] <humblerodent> I'm trying to get MythTV working properly on Ubuntu
[05:53] <tonyyarusso> Paladine: Ah, great
[05:53] <Paladine> whatcha installing?
[05:53] <humblerodent> but the audio mixer seems really weird having just upgraded to Edgy....when I turn on what /seems/ to be the line-in capture, it doesn't seem to work
[05:53] <humblerodent> can anyone help me?
[05:53] <c0re^> is the intel core2duo em64t x86-64 bit capable?
[05:53] <jperez> does anyone how to install correctly kaffeine or totem on ubuntu?
[05:53] <Ubootno> c0re^, yes it is
[05:54] <feryana> hi! What "server type" has yahoo.com e-mail for using it with Evolution??
[05:54] <Paladine> probably pop3
[05:54] <c0re^> pop3 more than likeley
[05:54] <feryana> doesn't work
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> Paladine: Going to try IrDA
[05:54] <c0re^> mail.yahoo.com?
[05:54] <Ubootno> feryana, I dont think you can do yahoo email with pop3, not unless you're paying for it
[05:54] <Phlosten> is there a way to quickly disable the flash plugin in firefox?
[05:54] <Paladine> tonyyarusso, lirc?
[05:54] <tonyyarusso> feryana: None
[05:54] <c0re^> or pop3.yahoo.com
[05:55] <tonyyarusso> Paladine: Some variation of that sort of thing
[05:55] <Ubootno> yahoo pop3 mail is a pay service
[05:55] <tonyyarusso> c0re^, feryana: Yahoo only offers pop access to paying customers
[05:55] <Ubootno> didnt use to be :(
[05:55] <jperez> does anyone how to install correctly kaffeine or totem on ubuntu?
[05:55] <Paladine> I need to plug in my home made IR Blaster now I have finally fitted my serial port :)
[05:55] <feryana> they can go to hell then
[05:55] <feryana> lol
[05:56] <feryana> I just wanted to open an e-mail out from my domain
[05:56] <fiveiron> ok, i type "sudo iwconfig eth1 esside BSD_AP", and nothing happens
[05:56] <feryana> coz I need ot be in a group lol
[05:56] <fiveiron> how do i bring a wireless interface up?
[05:56] <Konnektion> ifup wlan1
[05:56] <Konnektion> i belive
[05:56] <tonyyarusso> fiveiron: 'sudo ifup interface#'
[05:56] <fiveiron> ah
[05:56] <sky123> or if you're really lazy install network-manager
[05:57] <Paladine> network-manager sucks
[05:57] <Paladine> it doesn't allow you to do ip aliasing :)
[05:57] <sky123> but im kinda against all this "so-called" useful tools...
[05:57] <sky123> lemme finish...
[05:58] <sky123> because they dont teach you how to use linux
=== Wicked_ is now known as F2D`Wicked
[05:58] <Paladine> I would much rather edit interfaces than use network manager
[05:58] <sky123> let alone do something like ethernet bonding or setting mtu's or whatever..
[05:58] <Paladine> at least it affords you full control
[05:58] <sky123> agreed
[05:59] <Paladine> and there is no lack of documentation out there about how to do it as well
[05:59] <sky123> but I have yet to meet someone on here that has knowledge abouthow to bond an interface in ubuntu...
[05:59] <sky123> too many gui gods
[05:59] <fiveiron> ok, the interface was already up apparently, but the light on my laptop isn't on, and I'm not connected to my access point.... shoudn't it connect when i give it an essid?
[05:59] <ex_> guys, if I change my repos for feisty, will I have to download many updates?
[06:00] <Paladine> sky123, I have never had to bond interfaces, but I bet I could figure it outin less than 5 minutes if I needed to :)
[06:00] <sky123> fiveiron: the light is a good indicator that the driver is working properly...who makes the interface?
[06:00] <sky123> good 4 u
[06:00] <sky123> ;?
[06:00] <fiveiron> sky123, Broadcom... and the light is not on
[06:00] <jperez> sky123: how to install totem correctly for ubuntu?
[06:01] <sky123> jperez: though its not official on here there is automatix....chek it out on google...some people dont like it here...it should do the job for you.
[06:01] <jperez> does anyone what video player is able to ubuntu?
[06:01] <sky123> fiveiron: bcm43xx? or ?
[06:01] <anthonykid> hello
[06:02] <Paladine> sky123, its like when people rant about how linux is carp because you have to use the cli blah blah blah
[06:02] <sky123> jperez: i personally use mplayer...with the mozilla plugin...works awesome.
[06:02] <Paladine> using the cli gives you the experience and confidence to actually control your system insteadof it controlling you (aka windows)
[06:02] <fiveiron> sky123, yeah, bcm43xx
[06:02] <sky123> fiveiron: what kind of laptop??
[06:02] <aeread> anyone here runnin exaile? im gettin some libatk dependency failure, even tho libatk is installed >.<
[06:02] <anthonykid> Dear all (or anyone who's willing to help...), as far as drivers go, and im going to have to install them from my original discs?
[06:02] <fiveiron> sky123, compaq presario v5000
[06:02] <Madpilot> sky123, if by "do the job", you mean "quite possibly break your Ubuntu system", then yes, automatix will 'do the job'...
[06:03] <jperez> sky123: thank you
[06:03] <Madpilot> anthonykid, drivers for what?
[06:03] <snook353> anyone direct me to info on "Trusted Computing"?
[06:03] <Ubootno> anthonykid, drivers for what?
[06:03] <anthonykid> my PC
[06:03] <anthonykid> im installing
[06:03] <anthonykid> ubuntu
[06:03] <anthonykid> obviously it doesn't come with any graphics or audio drivers
[06:03] <anthonykid> yes..no?
[06:03] <Ubootno> anthonykid, you're going to have to be a little less vague
[06:03] <Ubootno> anthonykid, depends on the hardware
[06:03] <sky123> Like i said there are people who will always be against a certain,...going on 4 solid months of use on my ubuntu box with automatix...each to his/her own
[06:03] <Madpilot> anthonykid, you need to be specific. Drivers for what hardware? Audio & basic graphics don't usually need setting up or extra drivers, they should just work
[06:03] <sky123> anyhow...
[06:03] <Paladine> anthonykid, unless you have some really funky hardware sound and graphics willprobably work out of the box
[06:04] <anthonykid> hmm
[06:04] <anthonykid> well
[06:04] <anthonykid> this was originally a Windows machine (obviously)
[06:04] <Madpilot> !enter
[06:04] <anthonykid> i clean installed a few times
[06:04] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[06:04] <anthonykid> and every time, i had to reinstall audio and graphics drivers
[06:04] <sky123> fiveiron: can you find out for certain if it is bcm4318?
[06:04] <Paladine> heya MadPilot
[06:04] <fiveiron> it is...
[06:04] <sky123> fiveiron: or bcm4311 or 4314?
[06:04] <Ubootno> anthonykid, but what does that have to do with linux?
[06:04] <Madpilot> anthonykid, most of that irritation is missing from Ubuntu & Linux, happily.
[06:04] <anthonykid> nothing
[06:05] <Paladine> anthonykid, this isn't windows :)
[06:05] <anthonykid> yeah..
[06:05] <anthonykid> well, actually
[06:05] <anthonykid> got an iMac in March
[06:05] <anthonykid> haven't used windows since
[06:05] <anthonykid> but i wanted to give ubuntu a try with my old pc
[06:05] <humblerodent> hey my mobo's clock is running a bit too fast
[06:05] <sky123> fiveiron: with a couple of days of fighting it ....i ended up using ndiswrapper
[06:05] <humblerodent> brb
[06:05] <fiveiron> sky123, wait a minute... i found a forum post that might work
[06:05] <Ubootno> anthonykid, how old?
[06:05] <Madpilot> anthonykid, please use one line per sentence - you're hitting Enter way too often
[06:05] <sky123> k
[06:05] <anthonykid> sorry
[06:05] <anthonykid> i'm 16
[06:05] <amdgamer> hello?
[06:05] <Ubootno> hi there!
[06:05] <anthonykid> yes?
[06:06] <caffiend> Problems with Ubuntu server (no GUI) 6.10, it won't let me log in. during install it asked for full name (tom jones) then it said username (tom), I said ok.  I entered the PW 2x, finished install
[06:06] <amdgamer> i have a problem
[06:06] <Madpilot> anthonykid, no, how old is the PC?
[06:06] <anthonykid> lmao, sorry --> bout 4 years
[06:06] <sky123> anthonykid: at age 16 the first strep to step out of the "point and click" generation...youll actually learn how to fix things...nice work! :)
[06:06] <sky123> !ask
[06:06] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:07] <b33r-> Hello will ubuntu run smoothly on a p2 400MHz, 256 SD-RAM and HD 4 GB?
[06:07] <anthonykid> lol, 4GB?
[06:07] <sky123> b33r: probably without X
[06:07] <Ubootno> b33r-, itll run slow and smooth
[06:07] <Ubootno> like Karo Syrup
[06:07] <b33r-> :o
[06:07] <Madpilot> anthonykid, Ubuntu should install just fine on a PC that's only 4 years old - what's the system specs? CPU/RAM/etc?
[06:07] <humblerodent> back
[06:07] <amdgamer> windows install cannot boot, i need to recover files, running live 5.10, can i share the whole computer and access it from my other windows machine, to recover files?
[06:07] <humblerodent> so
[06:07] <humblerodent> my mobo's clock is running a little bit too fast
[06:08] <Ubootno> amdgamer, yes
[06:08] <anthonykid> ok... intel pentium 4 2.8ghz, 512 megs of ram, pretty sure 128 vRAM not sure tho
[06:08] <humblerodent> I know there's a way of setting it to periodically sync with NTP servers
[06:08] <amdgamer> okay... ive been trying samba
[06:08] <humblerodent> like every 10 minutes or so; I'm not sure exactly of the interval
[06:08] <sky123> amdgamer: the use of damnsmall linux or knoppix might serve your needs as well
[06:08] <Paladine> you shouldn't have any problems with that machine anthonykid
[06:08] <amdgamer> hmm...
[06:08] <anthonykid> ok, thanks
[06:08] <cablesm102> !ubuntu-desktop
[06:08] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[06:08] <Ubootno> amd get yourself an ssh/scp program
[06:08] <humblerodent> but how do I do this?  I thought it was just the thing in the "adjust time/date" deal but I did that and it is still running fast.
[06:08] <anthonykid> im going to start installing now... i have an iMac sitting right next to the PC
[06:09] <amdgamer> easier with damnsmall linux?
[06:09] <sky123> Ubootno: that is good advice :)
[06:09] <anthonykid> me
[06:09] <anthonykid> my messages weren't going thru
[06:09] <Ubootno> thx
[06:09] <anthonykid> *kisses iMac*
[06:09] <cablesm102> Is there anything I can do to make Firefox use mplayer-plugin rather than totem without uninstalling totem-mozilla?
[06:09] <h1st0> humblerodent, right click on the clock and adjust date time.. There should be an ntp setting in there.
[06:09] <sky123> amdgamer: I had to recover a server that way and scp'd the files... and no issues.
[06:09] <anthonykid> anyone else here a supposed apple fanboy?
[06:09] <caffiend> rickyfingers: u still there?  got it working and installed, now I can't log in.  did this before too.
[06:09] <h1st0> cablesm102, remove the totem plugin form /usr/share/firefox/plguins
[06:09] <RegalEagle> How do I mount my Windows Parition in Ubuntu?
[06:09] <h1st0> cablesm102, plugins
[06:09] <humblerodent> h1st0: yup, I've already done all of that....it doesn't seem to be syncing it periodically
[06:09] <amdgamer> quite easy to set up? im a noob at linux
[06:09] <cablesm102> h1st0, thanks

[06:10] <cablesm102> What made it suggest that?
[06:11] <sky123> cablesm102: I had the same issue... i guess uninstalling the totem-plugin...which on my box, I believe it kept both totem and mplayer...but used the mplayer-plugin
[06:11] <h1st0> amdgamer, oh sharing the hdd over a windows network?
[06:11] <Madpilot> cablesm102, people using the !anyone tell
[06:11] <amdgamer> i currently have ubuntu 5.10 running live... yes over the W network
[06:11] <h1st0> !samba > amdgamer
[06:11] <dks_matt> hey there, I'm having massive problems with my sound setup since changing cards, could anyone tell me if there's a way to completely reinstall all of the sound systems?  Alsamixer is telling me my card doesn't exist, when the card is present in the device mixer and sound settings dialogue.  I installed the new card to play with jack etc. and do recording so it's very important to me I get everything working if anyone could help
[06:11] <dks_matt> I would really appreciate it.
[06:11] <anthonykid> one more question --> i just purchased a logitech wireless mouse/keyboard setup... what are the chances ill need drivers for them to work?
[06:11] <h1st0> !sound > dks_matt
[06:12] <humblerodent> the new sound mixer in edgy seems screwy....
[06:12] <paradizelost> DBO, u around?
[06:12] <Madpilot> anthonykid, I've used wireless kb/mice on a couple of versions of Ubuntu, they 'just work' too
[06:12] <dks_matt> is there a sound channel?
[06:12] <humblerodent> I had to go to alsamixer in order to set my line-in as capture properly
[06:12] <Khalsa> Hello, If I have this card: nvidia Corporation NV18 [Geforce MX 4000 AGP 8x]  (rev c1), is the the proper document I should be following to install the drivers: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia or something else? I tried following that and it killed X, i had to restore the xorg.conf to the default.
[06:12] <anthonykid> sounds good
[06:12] <h1st0> anthonykid, search for your model on www.ubuntuforums.org but I doubt you'll need drivers.
[06:12] <anthonykid> im starting it up now
[06:12] <anthonykid> alright
[06:12] <h1st0> Khalsa, sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[06:13] <h1st0> anthonykid, try the live cd first to see.
[06:13] <anthonykid> yeah, i'm doing that now
[06:13] <anthonykid> i just put it in... it's providing testing features
[06:13] <h1st0> dks_matt, did you check out sound on the desktop guide at help.ubuntu.com?
[06:13] <dks_matt> no I'll go check it out thanks
[06:14] <sky123> Who has experience with sun-sparc ubuntu install??
[06:14] <Khalsa> h1st0: nvidia-glx is already the newest version
[06:14] <h1st0> Khalsa, try glxinfo | grep render      what does that output?
[06:15] <Traveler> Hey boys and hopefully one or two girls. I've recently installed Ubuntu and my screen goes pitch-black!
[06:15] <Traveler> I know I've gotten into Ubuntu since I can hear sounds of drums and stuff
[06:15] <h1st0> Traveler, did the live cd work?  or has the system's display ever worked with ubuntu?
[06:15] <Traveler> no
[06:15] <Traveler> live CD didn't work
[06:15] <Khalsa> h1st0: A bunch of lines like: Xlin: extenstion "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[06:15] <h1st0> Traveler, okay what type of video card?
[06:15] <Traveler> I used the alternate
[06:15] <Khalsa> h1st0: Xlib*
[06:15] <Traveler> Radeon X700 Mobility
[06:15] <amdgamer> live doesnt affect your system correct?
[06:15] <h1st0> Khalsa, okay what else have you tried as far as installing nvidia drivers?
[06:15] <h1st0> Khalsa, did you use automatix?
[06:16] <h1st0> amdgamer, correct unless you mount and format the drive its booting off of the cd.
[06:16] <h1st0> !fglrx > Traveler
[06:16] <pontusen> trying to get iptables working, in it's conf i should have a line like this "-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable" but then i can't copy the bak back?
[06:16] <sky123> automatix...is a bad word around here...lol
[06:16] <anthonykid> damnet, im installing ubuntu right noww, but it's not detecting the wireless keyboard
[06:16] <Khalsa> h1st0: nothing, just that document, which, on restart of X, did not restart x and went to command line. I then restred the xorg.conf that was backup
[06:16] <h1st0> Traveler, you can boot into recovery mode and install the proper video drivers.  See if that helps you out.
[06:16] <amdgamer> ahh thanks
[06:16] <humblerodent> brb
[06:17] <h1st0> Khalsa, well just make sure in /etc/X11/xorg.conf you have the line Driver "nvidia"    under the device section.
[06:17] <Khalsa> h1st0: i doubt it, I just restored it to the default xorg.conf
[06:17] <sky123> h1st0: maybe a pastebin of his xorg.conf??
[06:17] <h1st0> Khalsa, well thats the problem.  What are you trying to get working?
[06:17] <Traveler> h1st0: I can't even get into console, how am I supposed to install theese drivers? :P
[06:17] <lullabud> anthonykid:  is it bluetooth or RF?
[06:18] <anthonykid> USB reciever
[06:18] <h1st0> Traveler, boot to recovery mode.
[06:18] <amdgamer> reading up on samba shows alot of connecting users, but i want to share my HDD
[06:18] <Khalsa> h1st0: I haven't tried yet, but I want to get the game "tremulous" working
[06:18] <lullabud> anthonykid:  usb with RF or bluetooth?
[06:18] <h1st0> amdgamer, well you need to share you hdd with samba.
[06:18] <anthonykid> RF
[06:18] <sky123> Traveler: so when you try a ctrl-alt-f1 or f2 it does nothing??
[06:18] <Traveler> h1st0: how?
[06:18] <anthonykid> (im assuming, it was cheap and i know bluetooth is expensive)
[06:18] <lullabud> anthonykid:  what kind of system?
[06:18] <Traveler> sky123: ctrl-alt-f1 locks my computer up
[06:18] <anthonykid> systemax
[06:18] <amdgamer> i just dont userstand how to set up the permissions
[06:18] <Traveler> same with f2
[06:18] <h1st0> Khalsa, well change the deivce section so that it says Driver "nvidia" instead of nv or vesa.
[06:19] <lullabud> anthonykid:  hmm... yeah, probably a bios problem.
[06:19] <cablesm102> h1st0, what did you say about disabling the Totem mozilla plugin? My computer crashed, and I have no log of this chat.
[06:19] <Traveler> So how do I get into recovery mode? -_-
[06:19] <anthonykid> lulla: well, maybe not... this is during installation
[06:19] <lullabud> anthonykid:  that's one of the best things about newer computers.  bios-level usb peripheral recognition.
[06:19] <h1st0> cablesm102, you could try moving the totem plugin out of /usr/share/firefox/plugins/   to somewhere else... That will disable it after restarting firefox.
[06:19] <anthonykid> oh boy...
[06:19] <lullabud> anthonykid:  so, does it work, then it quits working?
[06:19] <h1st0> cablesm102, but it will remain installed as far as the system is concerned.
[06:19] <cablesm102> h1st0, thanks
[06:19] <cablesm102> Traveler, when your system boots up, get into the grub menu by holding ESC. Then choose recovery mode from the menu
[06:20] <anthonykid> lulla: i've got "Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 114..."
[06:20] <lullabud> anthonykid:  actually, here's a test.  when you press "esc" or "tab" or "f2" when the system is booting, does anything happen?
[06:20] <TheLance> hey does anyone know if there is an mp3 to .aac file converter for linux?
[06:20] <lullabud> anthonykid:  that sounds bad.
[06:20] <h1st0> TheLance, google?
[06:20] <anthonykid> lulla: actually, i've got an interface now, and the mouse is being detected
[06:20] <anthonykid> so maybe it's fine
[06:20] <TheLance> tried it
[06:20] <TheLance> nothing
[06:21] <anthonykid> (taking forever to boot tho)
[06:21] <lullabud> anthonykid:  awesome.  it's rad when stuff actually works.  especially wireless mice and keyboards.
[06:21] <anthonykid> sure is... i've got it booted now
[06:21] <cablesm102> h1st0, there is no folder named plugins there. There IS one in /home/.mozilla, but all that's there is the flash plugin
[06:21] <anthonykid> Linux n00b here
[06:21] <amdgamer> i hate wireless mice and keyboards
[06:21] <h1st0> TheLance, http://aacs.kingdomsports.net/
[06:21] <amdgamer> batteries die soo quick
[06:21] <amdgamer> well thats my experience
[06:22] <h1st0> TheLance, nm don't go there spyware wtf.
[06:22] <TheLance> dont worry i fell upon that too
[06:22] <TheLance> but we don't get spyware
[06:22] <TheLance> we're running ubuntu
[06:22] <Dev05> Hi. I'm using Edgy here and I was trying to install a theme under Gnome and everything that I get are Windows 95-like controls. What is missing? I tried to compile, for example, the Candido engine and it tells me that I'm missing GTK+-2.8... :/
[06:22] <cablesm102> DEv05, I had that same exact problem
[06:23] <Khalsa> h1st0: oh, I restarted X and the nvidia logo came up for a moment, I assume this means success? (getting tremulous now)
[06:23] <John64> yep
[06:23] <John64> that means your NV drivers work
[06:23] <h1st0> TheLance, http://blog.i64.pl/PiosBlog/200608/16-convert-mp3-to-aac/
[06:23] <John64> clear
[06:23] <h1st0> Khalsa, yes
[06:23] <anthonykid> all: wow, i'm amazed--> ubuntu is partitioning my HDD for me... i never would have expected this
[06:23] <Dev05> cablesm102, Have you been able to fix it? I simply have no idea at all...
[06:23] <anthonykid> i was assuming i'd just clean install, overwrite windows
[06:23] <anthonykid> im impressed already
[06:23] <h1st0> Khalsa, to check for sure just glxinfo | grep render it should return Direct Rendering yes or somethign like that.
[06:24] <cablesm102> Dev05, nope. Every other theme has done the same thing also.
[06:24] <TheLance> ok
[06:24] <TheLance> thanks h1stwhatever
[06:24] <Khalsa> h1st0: yes, direct rendering: YES
[06:24] <h1st0> anthonykid, very easy to setup..  You definately want to read help.ubuntu.com  "the desktop guide"  will help you through most of your questions.    Also stay away from automatix and easyubuntu
[06:24] <h1st0> Khalsa, you're alls et.
[06:24] <Khalsa> h1st0: Thank you very much for your help. I really appreciate it
[06:24] <h1st0> Khalsa, all set
[06:24] <h1st0> np
[06:24] <Dev05> cablesm102, It's really weird. It shouldn't complain about Gtk packages being missing.
[06:24] <anthonykid> h1st0: what are automatix and easyubuntu?
[06:25] <cablesm102> Is anybody having trouble with themes on Edgy here?
[06:25] <Khalsa> anthonykid: automatix killed my first attempt at ubuntu i'd advise against it :-(
[06:25] <anthonykid> Khalsa: is it an auto installer?
[06:25] <h1st0> anthonykid, they are programs that make installing most common applications "easy"  but however its kind of a hacked way of doing  thingks.  If your check out the desktop guide for all your questions you will be fine.
[06:25] <h1st0> cablesm102, no
[06:26] <anthonykid> alright, thanks
[06:26] <cablesm102> Dev05, want to file a bug?
[06:26] <anthonykid> now all i need is for someone to explain to me the science behind a microprocessor, and i'm good to go!
[06:26] <anthonykid> *heh*
[06:26] <h1st0> anthonykid, the more experience you get you will see what a waste automatix is.  Because most everything you need can be installed in less clicks than installing autmatix etc...
[06:26] <Dev05> cablesm102, Good idea, I hadn't thought about it.
[06:26] <waseem> hi what are good mp4 players?
[06:27] <h1st0> waseem, vlc
[06:27] <TheLance> VLC
[06:27] <h1st0> waseem, totem  any thing works
[06:27] <TheLance> is the good one
[06:27] <cablesm102> Dev05, you do it, then email me the bug # please. Put it to confirmed, also.
[06:27] <squeee> How do i tell where a pkg comes from?  My wallpaper just turned black saying "USING UNTRUSTED REPOSITORES MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE".  Edgy-wallpapers upgraded....
[06:27] <waseem> h1st0 the sound doesnt seem to be working though
[06:27] <waseem> do you think its the file itself?
[06:27] <TheLance> sudo apt-get install vlc
[06:27] <h1st0> waseem, witht he proper codecs .    VLC doesn't need any codecs installed though.
[06:27] <h1st0> waseem, what are you trying to play it with?
[06:27] <TheLance> if you search around
[06:27] <waseem> h1st0 i tried both vlc and totem
[06:28] <TheLance> you can get the .wmv codec to work
[06:28] <waseem> and got no sound from both
[06:28] <jrib> cablesm102, Dev05: you need the -dev packages to compile things.  BUt I am pretty sure candido is in the repositories
[06:28] <TheLance> its probably your sound driver in linux
[06:28] <anthonykid> h1st0: i know partitioning an HDD is a tideous process, but ubuntu's installer is taking quite awhile... should i be worried?
[06:28] <h1st0> waseem, do you have the restricted codecs installed for totem to work?  i.e. gstreamer etc...
[06:28] <waseem> im not sure
[06:28] <waseem> how can i check/
[06:28] <h1st0> anthonykid, like how long?
[06:28] <anthonykid> it's been about 7/8 minutes now
[06:28] <Dev05> jrib, Yeah, but if you try to install a theme, you shouldn't need them. Or... Do you?
[06:29] <h1st0> anthonykid, well did you have it resize the windows partition and create new partitions in the free space?
[06:29] <anthonykid> h1st0: yeah
[06:29] <jrib> Dev05: some themes use particular gtk engines, so yes depending on the theme
[06:29] <h1st0> anthonykid, well the resizing could take a few minutes.  Also depends on how much data is on the rive.
[06:29] <anthonykid> alright, ill give it a bit more
[06:30] <Dev05> jrib, this one for example: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=34779 It won't work, however I do have Clearlooks installed.
[06:30] <anthonykid> im escaping past 20 minutes tho
[06:30] <waseem> h1st0: ya i have gstreamer
[06:30] <h1st0> anthonykid, I belive if you hit ctrl+alt+f1  or +f4  you might be able to see the progress of the installer text based.  To get back to X windows ctrl+alt+f7
[06:30] <waseem> its not the sound card, thats fine because i can play other things with sound
[06:30] <RegalEagle> What is the dpkg command to install rpm and tar.gz/tar.ball files?
[06:30] <cablesm102> Okay, I want to use mplayer plugin rather than totem plugin for mozilla, but I don't want to uninstall the totem plugin because I'd have to uninstall ubuntu-desktop. How can I disable it from Firefox?
[06:30] <h1st0> waseem, well if vlc can't play it and totem with gstreamer can't.  I'd start questioning the file.  Or possibly see if ffmpeg detects and audio stream.
[06:30] <anthonykid> h1st0: hmm... i tried that, nothing
[06:30] <jrib> Dev05: that one should probably work because, like you said, it is using clearlooks.  What exactly happens?
[06:31] <anthonykid> but, my computer is completely responsive in every way
[06:31] <RegalEagle> !rpm
[06:31] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[06:31] <waseem> how can i check if ffmpeg detects the audio stream?
[06:31] <amdgamer> samba security = ADS, what does that mean?
[06:31] <h1st0> cablesm102, i've told you sudo mv /usr/share/firefox/plugins/tot* /home/<username>/
[06:31] <h1st0> cablesm102, then restart firefox.
[06:31] <RegalEagle> !apt
[06:31] <ubotu> apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[06:31] <h1st0> waseem, try converting it.
[06:31] <cablesm102> h1st0, there is no plugins folder in usr/share/firefox
[06:31] <lullabud> amdgamer:  Active Directory Server ?
[06:31] <amdgamer> ah makes sense
[06:32] <h1st0> cablesm102, try locate firefox/plugins
[06:32] <jrib> cablesm102: /usr/lib but you can just do:  sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*   and firefox will rpefer mplayer
[06:32] <RegalEagle> Could someone show me how to install a package that Ive downloaded off of a website?
[06:32] <waseem> h1st0: convert it just by renaming it? or is there a special thing i have to do
[06:32] <cablesm102> jrib, thanks
[06:32] <h1st0> cablesm102, if it returns nothing sudo updatedb  then locate firefox/plugins   it may be in /usr/share/mozilla-firefox/plugins or something around there.
[06:32] <eetfunk> I'm following a tutorial and this bit is not familiar to me... what does it mean and how do i do it?  "I removed the setuid bit from the binary, and made it world-executable."
[06:32] <h1st0> jrib, nice  didn't realize touch would work.
[06:33] <anthonykid> h1st0: it's been about 15 minutes now :/
[06:33] <h1st0> eetfunk, it would help if you told us what the hell you where trying ot do?
[06:33] <eetfunk> h1st0: install an app
[06:33] <RegalEagle> !synaptic
[06:33] <ubotu> synaptic is Ubuntu's Graphical Package Manager. For a good howto see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[06:34] <jrib> RegalEagle: what is it a package for?
[06:34] <h1st0> eetfunk, but that would mostlikley mean that any person could execute it i.e. sudo chmod a+x whateverfile   also it may mean you hav eto put the file in yoru path somewhere.
[06:34] <squeee> How do i find out which repository a package came from?
[06:34] <bsnider> has anybody got a geforce 6200?
[06:34] <RegalEagle> jrib: VMware tools
[06:34] <h1st0> eetfunk, what app?
[06:34] <jrib> RegalEagle: you can double click on .deb's
[06:34] <cablesm102> jrib, Touch didn't work... trying deleting the file
[06:34] <h1st0> squeee, /msg ubotu info <packagename>
[06:34] <RegalEagle> jrib: There's an rpm and tar.gz package
[06:34] <jrib> cablesm102: you have to close all instances of firefox and open it again
[06:34] <h1st0> squeee, also possible apt-cache showpkg packagename      may work.
[06:35] <jrib> ubotu: tell RegalEagle about vmware
[06:35] <eetfunk> h1st0: dspam
[06:35] <cablesm102> jrib, i did...
[06:35] <RegalEagle> !vmware
[06:35] <ubotu> VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository. Instructions to install VMWare Server can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingVMWare
[06:35] <h1st0> eetfunk, you realize its in the repos right?
[06:35] <RegalEagle> I need the VMware tools
[06:35] <eetfunk> h1st0: yes but i want to install from source
[06:35] <h1st0> eetfunk, could be installed via synaptic or sudo apt-get install dspam  would work.
[06:35] <RegalEagle> not player
[06:35] <squeee> h1st0: My Wallpaper now says "USING UNTRUSTED REPOSITORES MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE"
[06:35] <h1st0> eetfunk, ahh well if you want to install from source.
[06:36] <jrib> RegalEagle: search the wiki for vmware tools, there's a page
[06:36] <Tokenbad> RegalEagle, what are you trying t do...
[06:36] <Tokenbad> the vmware tools?
[06:36] <RegalEagle> yes
[06:36] <pontusen> help! i can only get port 22 open with iptables, can't see what im doing wrong!?
[06:36] <RegalEagle> RPM and tar.gz packages
[06:36] <Tokenbad> have you loaded vmware...and your virtual machine?
[06:36] <RegalEagle> Yes
[06:36] <RegalEagle> Running Ubuntu right now
[06:36] <RegalEagle> >_>
[06:36] <jrib> RegalEagle: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VmwareTools
[06:36] <Tokenbad> ok hold a min
[06:37] <Tokenbad> you can pick to install vmware from within vmware server
[06:37] <Tokenbad> at the top...think its vmware....
[06:37] <RegalEagle> Yes
[06:37] <Tokenbad> then under that install vmware tools
[06:37] <RegalEagle> Yes
[06:37] <RegalEagle> It brings up two packages
[06:38] <RegalEagle> An RPM and a tar.gz
[06:38] <tonyyarusso> I could use some help with lirc/irda if anyone's done that
[06:38] <Tokenbad> hmm.....weird...mine did a auto install
[06:38] <bsnider> has anybody got any geforce 6x series card?
[06:38] <RegalEagle> Double-clicking doesnt work
[06:38] <Tokenbad> well rpm will not work in ubuntu
[06:38] <RegalEagle> Ive got alien installed
[06:38] <Tokenbad> so would have to get tar.gz
[06:38] <RegalEagle> Ive got the tar.gz
[06:38] <Tokenbad> did you untar it?
[06:39] <RegalEagle> How do I do that?
[06:39] <Tokenbad> I normally do gunzip file.tar.gz...then tar -xf file.tar
[06:39] <anthonykid> all: if i dual boot, will ubuntu automatically add a boot loader?
[06:40] <gunner> yes
[06:40] <Tokenbad> but think there is a step with tar to do it all in one step
[06:40] <gunner> to windows that is
[06:40] <Jordan_U> yes still
[06:40] <RegalEagle> gunzip file.tar.gz
[06:40] <RegalEagle> So I do that?
[06:40] <h1st0> squeee, just change your wallpaper?  I don't understand?
[06:40] <Jordan_U> nv
[06:40] <Tokenbad> where file is the full name of the the file...yes
[06:40] <h1st0> RegalEagle, tar xvzf file.tar.gz
[06:40] <Tokenbad> then do tar -xf file.tar
[06:41] <Tokenbad> h1st0, has the command I couldn't remember
[06:41] <Tokenbad> heheh
[06:41] <h1st0> RegalEagle, tar -xzvf file.tar.gz
[06:42] <RegalEagle> Do I do that in a terminal?
[06:42] <jrib> tar xf file.tar.gz  will work as well, tar is getting smart
[06:42] <h1st0> RegalEagle, yes
[06:42] <anthonykid> are there less features on the live CD than are there in an actual installation?
[06:42] <amdgamer> anthonykid, live is slow
[06:42] <gunner> very
[06:42] <Madpilot> anthonykid, no, same stuff is installed by default on both.
[06:43] <Vaun> How can I tell if Aiglx is running?
[06:43] <Madpilot> and yes, live is slow compared to installed
[06:43] <h1st0> anthonykid, not really you but you can install any software you want using synaptic   You can even install program while booted to the live cd with synaptic.  However they will be gone after reboot.
[06:43] <harisund> Hello! When I use iptables to log packets, where do they get logged? In some file? There are some bad packets being dropped, I want to know where they are coming from.
[06:43] <h1st0> harisund, perhaps in /var/log somehwere?
[06:43] <RegalEagle> It wont let me tar it
[06:44] <anthonykid> thank's all
[06:44] <tuko> hello
[06:44] <RegalEagle> tar: Child returned status 2
[06:44] <anthonykid> damn, this partitioner is taking quite awhile
[06:44] <harisund> h1st0: yeah.. that's what I thought too.. do you have any idea of that file?
[06:44] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  try `file foo.tar.gz`
[06:44] <h1st0> RegalEagle, tar -zxvf file.tar.gz  wille xtract it into a folder
[06:44] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  "file" is actually the command.
[06:45] <RegalEagle> oh
[06:45] <h1st0> harisund, dunno look for a iptables directory in /var/log/
[06:45] <RegalEagle> So I enter that word for word?
[06:45] <h1st0> harisund, most log files get put there.  Or possibly in /tmp
[06:45] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  well, change the foo.tar.gz to whatever the actual filename is.
[06:45] <squeee> h1st0: It just feels like a threat to me and i'd like to find out which repository did it.
[06:45] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  the child process is probably gunzip, so if it's returning 2 it may not be a valid file.
[06:46] <RegalEagle> It's on cdrom0
[06:46] <RegalEagle> The package is
[06:46] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  what is the full filename?
[06:46] <RegalEagle> VMwareTools-1.0.1-29996.tar.gz
[06:46] <lullabud> ooooh
[06:46] <h1st0> squeee,  Well you had to change your wallpaper unless you are running a beta version of ubuntu like fiesty.
[06:46] <h1st0> squeee, possibly when the theme updated something got borked.
[06:46] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  so, if it's on a cdrom, you can't extract it.  you'll have to `cp VMwareTools-1.0.1-29996.tar.gz ~/` or something
[06:46] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  then extract it.
[06:47] <RegalEagle> oh
[06:47] <RegalEagle> I'll try
[06:47] <tuko> guys i have a dialup problem, can you help me ?
[06:47] <harisund> h1st0: thanks for the help ... I am not able to find it.. I will continue to search :)
[06:47] <h1st0> RegalEagle, cp that file to your home folder first
[06:47] <squeee> h1st0: No it's an image with a skull and crossbones with a threatening message about my repositories... i really wanna find out what did this
[06:47] <h1st0> RegalEagle, you can't extract it on the cd.
[06:47] <RegalEagle> It wont cp >_>
[06:47] <h1st0> squeee, screenshot?
[06:48] <shiggity> Guys, BEAUTIFUL job on the new Ubuntu release. It's incredible.
[06:48] <h1st0> squeee, you can upload it to www.imageshack.us  dunno if pastebin allows screen shots you could also try there.
[06:48] <RegalEagle> I did: cp VMwareTools-1.0.1-29996.tar.gz ~/
[06:48] <h1st0> harisund, well you could try locate
[06:48] <h1st0> harisund, locate iptables
[06:48] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  then do `cd ; tar -xvzf VMwareTools-1.0.1-29996.tar.gz`
[06:48] <RegalEagle> ok
[06:48] <h1st0> cd ~
[06:49] <lullabud> h1st0:  `cd` is the same as `cd ~`
[06:49] <h1st0> lullabud, ahh cool
[06:49] <boris55> hey all
[06:49] <h1st0> Is there a keyboard shortcut for that?
[06:49] <squeee> h1st0: http://img168.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ubuntusmoothchocolatezn2.png
[06:49] <lullabud> h1st0:  yeah, it's C D
[06:49] <lullabud> ;-)
[06:49] <h1st0> squeee, I have never seen that before.  That is definately odd.
[06:50] <boris55> question about using bcm43xx?
[06:50] <h1st0> lullabud, lol
[06:50] <amdgamer> lol
[06:50] <h1st0> lullabud, well its still one key press longer than a shortcut.
[06:50] <sc4ttrbrain> squeee, lol,good wallpaper
[06:50] <RegalEagle> Still not working
[06:50] <h1st0> lullabud, like ctrl+d type stuff
[06:50] <lullabud> h1st0:  LOL, only a quake geek would worry about one keystroke
[06:50] <squeee> ya
[06:51] <squeee> anybody know how to find out where this came from?
[06:51] <lullabud> h1st0:  the quake 1 manual said to use ".rc" instead of ".cfg" because it was one letter shorter. :P
[06:51] <h1st0> squeee, welll do you use aptitude or apt-get to install software
[06:51] <squeee> yes
[06:51] <squeee> there was an upgrade for edgy-wallpapers
[06:51] <h1st0> lullabud, lol
[06:51] <squeee> and that's waht happend
[06:51] <minghua> Can edgy desktop i386 install CD handle existent LVM?
[06:52] <h1st0> squeee, Well i'm up to date and I don't have that wallpaper
[06:52] <lullabud> squeee:  you might try doing a `strings /path/wallpaper.png | more` and see what it says.
[06:52] <RegalEagle> Ok, I extracted the tar.gz to my Desktop
[06:52] <amdgamer> you dont have to restart samba when you add a user?
[06:52] <squeee> hist0: I used a list of repositories from a friend, so i have alot
[06:52] <jrib> squeee: that wallpaper hints at the problem, what unofficial repos are you using
[06:52] <squeee> lullabud: I ran it through hexedit, nothing
[06:53] <RegalEagle> lullbud: I extracted the tar.gz to the Desktop
[06:53] <squeee> jrib: Too many to list, I'm going to format just in case, but i want to find out what did this
[06:53] <jrib> squeee: apt-cache policy edgy-wallpapers
[06:53] <RegalEagle> lullabud: By righ-click -> Extract to
[06:53] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  awesome!  let's all celebrate with a shot!
[06:53] <h1st0> RegalEagle, http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[06:53] <RegalEagle> lullabud: So how do I install now?
[06:53] <lullabud> RegalEagle:  ah, it's awesome when people find shortcuts. :)  i'm such a terminal nerd i forget that there actually are easy ways to do stuff.
[06:54] <squeee> jrib: gave me this...  http://johan.kiviniemi.name
[06:54] <h1st0> RegalEagle, take a look at the link I sent you will tell you how to install anything in ubuntu.
[06:54] <cpk1> trying to ssh to my other box using ssh user@host and it is refusing me?
[06:54] <RegalEagle> lol
[06:54] <RegalEagle> h1st0, Ive got that link bookmarked ;)
[06:54] <h1st0> lullabud, well terminal is a much easier way to tell people how to do stuff on irc.
[06:54] <lullabud> cpk1:  what's the error say, or is it just timing out?
[06:54] <lullabud> h1st0:  true.dat
[06:54] <h1st0> cpk1, is sshd running on the other box?
[06:54] <jrib> squeee: well that's probably it then
[06:54] <cpk1> it says connection refused
[06:55] <lullabud> cpk1:  ssh is probably not installed.
[06:55] <cpk1> and i have no idea its completely headless right now
[06:55] <h1st0> !ssh > cpk1
[06:55] <lullabud> cpk1:  ....on the target host, that is.
[06:55] <cpk1> i see, is there any way i can access it then without ssh?
[06:55] <cpk1> i would like to turn it off nicely
[06:56] <h1st0> cpk1, not without a head
[06:56] <h1st0> cpk1, unless you exploited it.
[06:56] <screechingcat> why does Ubuntu say i have two floppy drives even though i have only one ?
[06:56] <cpk1> forgive me, dear desktop
[06:56] <Khalsa> What is the linux filezilla/smartftp equivalent? (I know how to do ftp/etc from command line, just would be nice to have a gui)
[06:56] <lullabud> cpk1:  sometimes you can press ctrl-alt-del to get it to reboot... then power off when you hear the post beep.
[06:56] <amdgamer> samba, do i want wins server?
[06:56] <cpk1> yes but it doesnt even have a keyboard or mouse atm
[06:56] <Toma-> Khalsa: d4x
[06:56] <RegalEagle> h1st0: What are these "compiler tools"?
[06:57] <screechingcat> my / dir contains "Floppy1 and Floppy Drive"
[06:57] <lullabud> cpk1:  plug one in?
[06:57] <screechingcat> how do i get rid of the Floppy1 ?
[06:57] <cpk1> i dont have any of those with me right now ><
[06:57] <h1st0> RegalEagle, sudo apt-get build-essential   thats a meta package of tools for compiling software from source.
[06:57] <lullabud> screechingcat:  the preferred method is to throw it out the window.
[06:57] <cpk1> i will just have to be mean to it
[06:57] <Khalsa> Toma-: do i want d4x or d4x-common?
[06:57] <h1st0> cpk1, do you ahve acpi?
[06:58] <screechingcat> lullabud: the floppy drive or the icon ?
[06:58] <lullabud> screechingcat:  LOL, good question!
[06:58] <Trixse1> Ahh, thanks for the help... got in now :)
[06:58] <h1st0> cpk1, you could try just tapping the power button not holding it down.   See if it powers down that would be a nice way of suspending it.
[06:58] <lullabud> screechingcat:  you should be able to delete them with root privs.
[06:58] <Trixse1> h1st0: thx for your help :D
[06:58] <cpk1> i tried tapping it and didnt work
[06:58] <h1st0> Trixse1, np
[06:58] <cpk1> i powered it off >=(
[06:58] <screechingcat> lullabud: i tried. it got deleted and then came back after reboot
[06:58] <RegalEagle> h1st0: Invalid operation build-essential
[06:58] <lullabud> screechingcat:  do you have a floppy disk drive?
[06:59] <h1st0> cpk1, ahh well you have to do what you have to do sometimes
[06:59] <screechingcat> lullabud: yeah but only 1
[06:59] <cpk1> anyways time to go move it back to its peripherals thanks for the help =)
[06:59] <h1st0> RegalEagle, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[06:59] <RegalEagle> k
[06:59] <screechingcat> lullabud: and ubuntu shows 2

[06:59] <specialbuddy> can someone help me out with getting apollon working?
[06:59] <screechingcat> lullabud: yeah
[06:59] <lullabud> screechingcat:  do you have a virtual floppy, like from your bios emulating a usb flash disk as a floppy?
[07:00] <screechingcat> lullabud: i dont have a USB flash disk
[07:00] <h1st0> specialbuddy, you mean installing it?
[07:00] <tonyyarusso> What provides the lirc_sir module?
[07:00] <Keyseir> I'm having a wierd bug with apt-get on edgy. I referenced google but couldn't find an answer. Help please? http://pastebin.com/821697
[07:00] <specialbuddy> I have it installed but I can't get any of the networks to connect
[07:00] <screechingcat> specialbuddy: you need to configure GiFT
[07:00] <h1st0> lullabud, my typos are extremely high tonight.  Probably cuz I can barely see straight.  Gotta live spelll cheking.  But i'm to lazy to fix most of it.
[07:01] <specialbuddy> I did but I still can't figure out what I'm doing wrong
[07:01] <screechingcat> specialbuddy: there's a good guide on it in the ubuntu forums
[07:01] <h1st0> specialbuddy, firewall?
[07:01] <h1st0> specialbuddy, www.ubuntuforums.org
[07:01] <specialbuddy> I have a router
[07:01] <RegalEagle> h1st0: Is this available in Synaptic? I dont have my Ubuntu disc and it's not recognizing the Ubuntu ISO that VMware is supplying
[07:01] <screechingcat> specialbuddy: just look up "\GiFT, gnutella, ares, kazza" in the search box
[07:01] <lullabud> LOL @ h1st0 spelll checking indeed!
[07:01] <Trixse1> How do I compile stuff like mplayer in Ubuntu?
[07:02] <h1st0> !info build-essential
[07:02] <specialbuddy> ok

=== Konnektion is now known as lunchbox
[07:02] <RegalEagle> thanks
[07:02] <Toma-> Trixse1: its better to use synaptic to simple install the pre-compiled versions
[07:02] <screechingcat> Trixse1: just google "compile mplayer ubuntu"
[07:02] <Keyseir> squee: ok
[07:02] <RegalEagle> Sorry for all the work Im causing :p
[07:02] <Trixse1> ok thanks
[07:02] <lullabud> Keyseir:  that problem looks like a server issue...
[07:03] <h1st0> RegalEagle, any package int he repos is availble to install via synaptic its just easier for me to tell you to apt-get install rather than open synaptic and search and install.  blah blah
=== lunchbox is now known as Konnektion
[07:03] <lullabud> Keyseir:  probably referencing a 404 or something.

[07:07] <tonyyarusso> I'm trying to make my CD player's remote control work with my Thinkpad laptop via irda/lirc, and I have no idea what I'm doing.  I've read stuff on the Thinkwiki, Ubuntu wiki, and lirc site, and I think I have some pieces in place, but it's not all coming together.
[07:07] <screechingcat> amdgamer: this is a netwrok ?
[07:08] <h1st0> tonyyarusso, do you have lircd running and is it seeing your irda port?
[07:08] <screechingcat> amdgamer: not a dualboot ?
[07:08] <h1st0> tonyyarusso, if so try irw and see if the remote is being pickedup.
[07:08] <amdgamer> yes network
[07:08] <tonyyarusso> h1st0: I've had it both running and not; I'm supposed to have it not when doing a configuration step.  No idea if it sees anything.
[07:08] <h1st0> tonyyarusso, and if thats the case then you just mostlikely need a .lircrc in yoru ~
[07:08] <screechingcat> amdgamer: oh shit. im sorry. i thought u meant a dualboot
[07:08] <h1st0> tonyyarusso, irw isyour friend
[07:08] <tonyyarusso> h1st0: irw gives me an error and won't run
[07:08] <Keyseir> what happens if you "sudo chown $user / -R"?

[07:28] <dks_matt> its not a package
[07:29] <dks_matt> ive reinstalled everything in synaptic that has anything to do with alsa and it hasnt solved my problem
[07:29] <carthik> dks_matt, apt-cache search alsa will tell you what packages have "alsa" in their name.... reinstall the one that you think you need.
[07:29] <vega__> I forgot how to work Terminal.
[07:29] <vega__> Yes I'm a blonde.
[07:29] <vega__> H
[07:29] <vega__> How do you delete things again?
[07:29] <carthik> vega__, sudo rm whatever.txt
[07:29] <vega__> rm, Thanks.
[07:30] <OctobersDark> vega__: You can also use Krusader in root mode and overwrite the list that way too by replacing the file if you have a back-up
[07:30] <OctobersDark> vega__: It is a more graphical solution
[07:30] <dks_matt> I've already reinstalled everything I could find it didn't help
[07:31] <dks_matt> maybe if I explain my problem?
[07:31] <vega__> As long as I have the words I need I can use command line style computing.
[07:31] <B_166-ER-X> !xwinwrap
[07:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xwinwrap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:31] <OctobersDark> vega__: didn't mean to say you couldn't :-) no offense
[07:31] <vega__> None taken.
[07:32] <dks_matt> I've been trying to sort this for hours now :(
[07:32] <juan> hey alguien me puede ayudar???
[07:32] <dks_matt> I thought it was my sound card
[07:32] <dks_matt> but I can get some things to play
[07:33] <startgame412> hola juan
[07:33] <dks_matt> it's just anything to do with alsa gives me a message saying my sound card doesnt exist and i dont understand why
[07:33] <juan> ke onda
[07:33] <youser> hey ayone here use icon themes?
[07:33] <juan> lo que pasa es que acabo de instalar ubuntu 5.10
[07:33] <juan> ademas soy nuevo en la onda de linux
[07:34] <juan> y no se por donde empezar!!!
[07:34] <startgame412> yo tambien
[07:34] <lullabud> !es
[07:34] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[07:35] <vega__> What's the syntax to use rename?  What does the -v, -n, and -f do?
[07:35] <youser> icon themes?
[07:35] <vega__> Just sudo rename /etc/apt/sources.list.save /etc/apt/sources.list doesnt work.
=== Linuturk is now known as Linuturk_zZz
[07:35] <roryy> vega__: use 'mv' instead
[07:35] <vega__> Okay thanks.
[07:35] <vega__> So rename doesn't do anything helpful?
[07:36] <vega__> Or am I just using it wrong?
[07:36] <roryy> you can read 'man rename' to find out; it's for renaming groups of files in a pattern
[07:36] <vega__> MV worked, thanks.
[07:37] <startgame412> What's the best way to intall ubuntu. I have the live cd but would like to mave it on my pc so i don't have ot keep on configuring my setings each time i boot into Ubuntu
[07:37] <startgame412> It seems simple enough to me but I am woried about not erasing my windows xp install
[07:37] <vega__> It does not erase windows.
[07:37] <mikm[laptop] > startgame412- There should be an install icon on the desktop of the livecd
[07:37] <startgame412> yes
[07:38] <vega__> And it comes with an easy graphical interface when you start your computer asking which operating system to start.
[07:38] <h3htimo> hey, can someone help me get fglrx working???
[07:38] <halex-ab> startgame412, you can install it on a memory stick if you need..
[07:38] <dorto> startgame412, if you install ubuntu on a separate partition, you can use both windows and ubuntu at the same time
[07:38] <startgame412> I understand what to do but I am being cautious as to not overide my windows xp install and loose all my files
[07:38] <vega__> But that is dangerous, so I've heard.
[07:38] <mikm[laptop] > Well, not at the *same* time
[07:38] <vega__> You could, but that's bad practice
[07:38] <mikm[laptop] > How would you do that?
[07:38] <startgame412> can i use qpart ot do a partiion?
[07:38] <vega__> Dual boot.
[07:39] <dorto> startgame412, how many partitions do you have on your computer? how many of them store windows os, windows applicatios and windows data?
[07:39] <mikm[laptop] > vega__- But that's not at the "same" time :p
[07:39] <roryy> startgame412: i think there might be a way to say your settings on a memory stick
[07:39] <mikm[laptop] > vega__- Dual booting is safe.
[07:39] <startgame412> only 1 big 80 GB partion
[07:39] <roryy> dual booting is bad practise *horrors!*
[07:39] <roryy> :-)
[07:39] <youser> dual booting rocks
[07:39] <vega__> Dual booting is safe?  Then I'm misinformed.
[07:39] <halex-ab> How is it not safe?
[07:40] <youser> except windows shouldnt be ued on a linux computer cuz its inferior
[07:40] <vega__> Lol...
[07:40] <loaftop> uh
[07:40] <youser> and itll make linux thnk you dont love it anymore
[07:40] <roryy> i've been dual-booting for about three years and i haven't had an injury yet
[07:40] <halex-ab> heh, 'other' than that..
[07:40] <mikm[laptop] > youser- :|
[07:40] <vega__> I thought dual booting caused some programs to crash.  I guess not.
[07:40] <dorto> startgame412, in that case you will have to defragment the entire disk, TAKE A BACKUP OF IMPORTANT DATA, use GParted or something like that to create a new partition and then install ubuntu on it
[07:40] <mikm[laptop] > vega__- No...
[07:40] <h3htimo> anybody wanna try to help me with getting my video card driver to work???
[07:40] <mikm[laptop] > !ati | h3htimo
[07:40] <ubotu> h3htimo: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:40] <vega__> I wish WINE worked on 64 bit linux
[07:40] <vega__> Then I could throw windows out.
[07:41] <startgame412> tahnks guys
[07:41] <youser> anyone here use icon themes in ubuntu?
[07:41] <roryy> startgame412: here's how to save your settings on a memory stick: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
[07:41] <mikm[laptop] > I don't bother using 64-bit yet; the benefits don't outweigh the extra hassle.
[07:41] <vega__> I'm considering switching to 32 bit linux.
[07:41] <vega__> Even though my processor is 64 bit.
[07:41] <quinnster> I just use two 32 bit computers at the same time.
[07:42] <vega__> Lol..
[07:42] <mikm[laptop] > youser- I'm a fan of the Snowish theme for Gnome and the Cezaane theme for KDE
[07:42] <vega__> That doesn't help gaming.
[07:42] <mikm[laptop] > quinnster- heh :)
[07:42] <youser> i use dapper gnome
[07:42] <youser> i use glass icons
[07:42] <youser> theyre sick
[07:42] <dorto> its pain in the nect to maintain 64 bit applications. will give them a try after 1-2 years later
[07:42] <vega__> But then again since WINE doesnt work with 64 bit, I can't game on it anyway.
[07:42] <youser> i have the mozilla snowfox too
[07:42] <dorto> for now, 32 bit applications will do
[07:42] <youser> but my desktop folders are glass
[07:42] <h3htimo> mikm[laptop] , already tried that
[07:42] <youser> but when i browse folders
[07:42] <youser> theyre regular brown
[07:42] <sandy16> can any body help to boot from my grub
[07:43] <youser> i was wondering if icon themes only work for desktop and not inside folders?
[07:43] <daywalker> hello all, im having problems installing beryl, can anyoune assist?
[07:43] <mikm[laptop] > youser- The icon set might be incomplete
[07:43] <Xaphoo> can someone send me or pastebin me a completely default version of sources.list ?
[07:43] <dorto> sandy16, daywalker just ask your questions with as much info as possible
[07:43] <youser> so they should work for alll icons inside my comp?
[07:44] <keiron> hi. i have a REALLY annoying mount problem. i have this in my fstab: //dawn/Desktop    /home/keiron/dawn smbfs dmask=777,fmask=777  0    0 but when i boot my machine i have to sudo mount -a to get the mount to mount
[07:44] <Xaphoo> Can someone please send or pastebin me a completely default version of sources.list?
[07:44] <vega__> Well I have broken the package manager beyond my ability to fix it.
[07:44] <vega__> What's the reinstall program command from terminal?
[07:44] <roryy> !easysource
[07:44] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:44] <daywalker> when i enter this command "glxinfo | grep rendering" i get no
[07:44] <keiron> does anyone have any idea why it doesn't mount on startup of the os or a good work around
[07:44] <Xaphoo> thanks
[07:44] <Xaphoo> !easysource
[07:44] <mikm[laptop] > keiron- Try adding ",user" after fmask=777
[07:44] <mikm[laptop] > keiron- (No quotes, of course)
[07:44] <sandy16> dorto, i have installed edgy in my primary aprtion by keeping dapper aside .. dunno why, the grub is not loding intel boot agent is coming up
[07:44] <youser> ahh
[07:44] <youser> i do hVE GLASS ICONS  IN FOLDERS
[07:45] <youser> just not with nautilus
[07:45] <Xaphoo> !easysource  doesn't do anything
[07:45] <Xaphoo> !easysource
[07:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about easysource  doesn't do anything - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:45] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:45] <roryy> Xaphoo: go to http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:45] <vega__> lol..
[07:45] <Xaphoo> thanks
[07:45] <dorto> sandy16, you don't see the grub boot loader during the boot-up?
[07:46] <sandy16> dorto, i did its was installing on hd0
[07:46] <Xaphoo> ugh, that website doesn't have edgy
[07:46] <dorto> sandy16, do you have a live cd? dapper, edgy, knoppix or whatever?
[07:46] <keiron> mikm[laptop] : thanks i'm gonna try that now
[07:46] <vega__> What's all the talk about edgy?  A new linux distro?
[07:46] <sandy16> dorto, ya i do
[07:46] <mikm[laptop] > vega__- edgy is the codename for the most recent (6,10) release of Ubuntu
[07:46] <vega__> Oh there is a new ubuntu release?
[07:46] <vega__> Joy.
[07:47] <tamacracker> Yep
[07:47] <mikm[laptop] > vega__- Dapper (6.06) is the previous one
[07:47] <digivore> whats the file that i can set my netork card settings ?
[07:47] <vega__> But edgy isn't an animan name..
[07:47] <dorto> sandy16, then boot from it, change to the edgy partition using 'chroot' command, and reinstall grub on MBR
[07:47] <h3htimo> cmon guys ive been working on this for days now can someone just try to point me in the right direction??? i need help getting fglrx to be my video driver.... it shows up that mesa is my driver now
[07:47] <tamacracker> but it's a lil more "ugh" compared to dapper drake
[07:47] <dorto> sandy16, man chroot
[07:47] <sandy16> dorto, moreover i have even tried to reinstall my grub using grub> root (hd0,0) follwed by setup (hd0)
[07:47] <daywalker> when i enter this command "glxinfo | grep rendering" i get no. also when i try this " sudo nvidia-glx-config enable " i get your  x configuration has been altered......
[07:47] <SkyDrifter> can anyone help me please? Whilst experimenting I chose the login window chooser rather than greeting... but I use my system on desktop, not as a server... now I cannot login... is there a solution?
[07:48] <tamacracker> Hey anyone have nicotine and can help me step by step on installing it? The forum has a step that I cannot get past so I need real time help, please.
[07:48] <vega__> What is the command to reinstall a program such as Synaptic?
[07:49] <roryy> SkyDrifter: what do you mean you can't login? What happens when your computer starts?
[07:49] <dorto> sandy16, see if this helps: http://beans.seartipy.com/2005/12/29/system-rescue-act-using-gnulinux-live-cd/
[07:49] <roryy> vega__: something like 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall synaptic' -- but be careful if you've broken things
[07:49] <SkyDrifter> thank you roryy, I am asked via a panel to list my host, but I dont have one
[07:49] <dorto> sandy16, but in summary, you can always reinstall grub on mbr by booting from a live cd
[07:49] <vega__> All I broke was the repositories file.
[07:50] <vega__> When I was a n00b trying to install WINE, before I found out it didn't work on 64 bit.
[07:50] <daywalker> i have glx runing with compiz from a dapper installation.i upgraded to edgy & all went good but now id like to install beryl shou;ld i get rid of compiz first or wjat?
[07:50] <tamacracker> can anyone help me install nicotine please?
[07:50] <quinnster> daywalker, just curious.  how was xgl?
[07:50] <keiron> damn, that didn't work
[07:51] <keiron> is there any file that i can add commands to that is run at boot?
[07:51] <daywalker> quinnster, great i had no problems with it & it was really cool
[07:51] <roryy> SkyDrifter: sorry, I'm not at all familiar with this panel.  How did you choose this behaviour?
[07:52] <roryy> vega__: you can follow the easysource link to regenerate a standard sources.list
[07:52] <SkyDrifter> roryy, through the login option in admin
[07:52] <quinnster> daywalker, cool thanks.  i'm planning to install it tomorrow
[07:52] <Xaphoo> can someone please send me a DEFAULT sources.list?
[07:52] <SkyDrifter> rorry, so I can't put in my user name
[07:52] <SkyDrifter> roryy*
[07:52] <Xaphoo> please, it will just take a second
[07:53] <vega__> What is 'the easysource link'?
[07:53] <roryy> !easysource | vega__
[07:53] <ubotu> vega__: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:53] <vega__> Thanks.
[07:53] <tamacracker> Can anyone help me extract my nicotine into my Home... it says I'm not allowed.
[07:53] <daywalker> quinnster, i installed it as a session rather than default.I later made it my default set up, but maybe try it as a session just incase
[07:53] <Xaphoo> source-o-matic is no good
[07:53] <Xaphoo> it gives me all these outdated repos
[07:54] <dorto> extract nicotine in one's home? it's illegal in most countries...
[07:54] <tamacracker> are we not allowed to talk about nicotine anymore?
[07:54] <roryy> SkyDrifter: hmm. confusing. What version of ubuntu are you running?
[07:54] <tamacracker> heh.... i need to extract it into my home folder :\
[07:54] <quinnster> daywalker, ok thanks.  i'm doing it all on a testing partition but i'm hoping it works well on my laptop
[07:54] <SkyDrifter> I am using dapper roryy
[07:55] <Xaphoo> can someone send me an EDGY SOURCES.LIST ?  I know about source-o-matic, but it's not good
[07:55] <roryy> SkyDrifter: ah.  I think the edgy config for that must be a bit different, because I have `hostname choose' ticked, but it doesn't effect my login
[07:56] <roryy> SkyDrifter: have you ever edited text config files before?  Because you can possibly fix this by editing /etc/gdm/gdm.conf, but I'm not sure what you'd change
[07:56] <SkyDrifter> ok... roryy, when I boot, the welcome screen no longer shows, I think dapper wants me to log into a server, but i am using this system direct to our router
[07:57] <SkyDrifter> yes, I have, but I dont know how to get my terminal roryy
[07:57] <roryy> SkyDrifter: press Ctrl-Alt-F1
[07:57] <nrdb> is there a way to get apt-get to just download (and not install) a package without also getting all the dependancies?
[07:58] <SkyDrifter> :-) thank you roryy, will try it now, am about to get off my windows hdd... Be Back Soon and will let you know
[07:58] <Xaphoo> can someone send me an EDGY SOURCES.LIST ?  I know about source-o-matic, but it's not good
[07:58] <roryy> Xaphoo: here's my edgy sources.list: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30943/
[07:58] <Xaphoo> thanks sorry
[07:58] <Xaphoo> for re-posting
[07:58] <vega__> Thanks for the link, I managed to get the package manager working again.
[07:59] <tamacracker> Can anyone please help me extract my nicotine files into my home folder? It won't let me access it.
[07:59] <roryy> Xaphoo: if you have an Ubuntu install CD/DVD, and want to save a little bandwidth, you will want to run 'apt-cdrom add' after updating your sources.list
[07:59] <Xaphoo> ok...
[08:00] <vega__> Now after all this work fixing the package manager, I've forgotten the name of the package I'm looking for.
[08:00] <tamacracker> lol
[08:00] <roryy> Xaphoo: then run 'sudo aptitude update' (or 'sudo apt-get update', or use Synaptic to update), and you should be fine
[08:00] <vega__> What is the name of a popular media (music) player again?
[08:00] <tamacracker> totem
[08:00] <tamacracker> or amarok
[08:00] <vega__> Thanks.
[08:00] <tamacracker> :)
[08:00] <roryy> tamacracker: there is a version of nicotine (1.2.4) already available in ubuntu 6.10
[08:00] <rickyfingers> xmms
[08:01] <tamacracker> rorry that's the problem... I have that, but I cannot install it for some reason
[08:01] <JamieBE> I just installed the free-java-sdk program on ubuntu - How do I actually get it to run? Nothing has been added to the apps menu.
[08:01] <roryy> tamacracker: have you tried installing it with synaptic?
[08:01] <tamacracker> roryy oh wait, i have 1.2.6
[08:01] <rickyfingers> Jaime sdk is a suite of software
[08:01] <roryy> tamacracker: well, have you tried 1.2.4 ? It will be *much* easier to install
[08:01] <Toma-> JamieBE: you probably want eclipse
[08:01] <rickyfingers> and comman d line utilities
[08:02] <tamacracker> roryy the only one I see a link for is 1.2.6 :\
[08:02] <rickyfingers> Jame yep - Toma typed it before I could you need an IDE
[08:02] <JamieBE> Toma - is that a java dev. enviroment?
[08:02] <Toma-> JamieBE: yes
[08:02] <JamieBE> Toma, I will give it a look, thanks.
[08:02] <Toma-> np
[08:02] <roryy> tamacracker: are you running Ubuntu 6.10 ?
[08:02] <tamacracker> roryy yep, edgy :)
[08:03] <roryy> tamacracker: ok, run System -> Admin -> Synaptic
[08:03] <tamacracker> roryy done
[08:03] <roryy> tamacracker: click on the list of package names and type 'nico' -- do you see the word 'nicotine' appear?
[08:04] <tamacracker> roryy negative
[08:04] <tamacracker> roryy wait
[08:04] <tamacracker> roryy what the heck...
[08:04] <tamacracker> lol i see it.
[08:04] <roryy> ok, right click on it and choose 'Mark for installation'
[08:04] <tamacracker> roryy before I was click on the "Sections" then typing nicotine
[08:05] <rickyfingers> whats up oct?
[08:05] <roryy> tamacracker: now click 'Apply' and follow the prompts
[08:05] <tamacracker> roryy you're good you!!
[08:06] <roryy> :-)
[08:06] <vega__> So now that I've installed totem how do I access it?  It isn't in Applications -> sound and video.
[08:06] <tamacracker> roryy: thanks a lot, I really appreciate it :)
[08:06] <roryy> tamacracker: np. have fun
[08:06] <tamacracker> roryy thanks! you too :D
[08:06] <rickyfingers> vega_ get a terminal window
[08:06] <vega__> Am I going to have to use terminal every time?
[08:06] <roryy> vega__: Applications -> Sound and Video -> Movie player
[08:07] <rickyfingers> and type "whereis totem"
[08:07] <vega__> I want to be able to open the folder, click on the file, and play it.
[08:07] <roryy> vega__: I recommend vlc as an alternative movie player, fwiw
[08:07] <vega__> Oh that's why I couldn't find it.  I was expecting it to be named totem.
[08:07] <roryy> yeah, i don't know why rhythmbox is named and not totem *shrug*
[08:08] <iarwain> Hi, does anybody know about a "chroot error" ? i tried chrooting, and got this: "could not execute the command '/bin/bash': access denied"
[08:09] <roryy> iarwain: I think the place your chroot into needs a /bin/bash (and lots of other things) (but it's been a while since I used chroot)
[08:10] <rickyfingers> irawain, sounds like you might need to be root
[08:10] <iarwain> @roxy: it has, i'm trying to make a custem live-cd, so in the 'edit' folder(that's where i'm chrooting to) there is a bin folder, with bash etc
[08:10] <iarwain> did it  as root :)
[08:10] <khaije1> iarwain: the only thing shared by your main system and your chroot is the kernel (that is the way is it supposed to be anyway)
[08:11] <vega__> So totem doesn't come with a music decoder?
[08:11] <rickyfingers> iarwain: are you sure permissions are straight on the chrooted /bin/bash?
[08:11] <vega__> Where can I get a decoder for standard music files?
[08:11] <iarwain> rickyfingers: how do you mean?

[08:12] <vega__> What's xmms?
[08:12] <roryy> Yet Another Media Player
[08:12] <KingOfNowhere> it reminds me of winamp
[08:12] <vega__> Winamp is nice and straightforward.
[08:12] <vega__> So I'll try xmms.
[08:12] <roryy> read the restricted formats page pointed to above; that will also tell you how to enable DVD playback

[08:14] <variant> vega__: whichi s stupid as it was neverinteded to play multi medias, just mp3's :)
[08:14] <dedekind> so i just installed the nvidia binary driver, and it doesn't seem to work :)
[08:14] <vega__> What's wrong with xmms?
[08:14] <dedekind> at least not opengl
[08:14] <Mantice> If you are looking for players like winamp most of them are poo.
[08:15] <variant> vega__: try amarok, its quite big but very nice, personaly i use cplay a curses based player
[08:15] <dedekind> sudo nvidia-glx-config enable returns
[08:15] <Mantice> amarok is good.
[08:15] <dedekind> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[08:15] <khaije1> dedekind: did you ' nvidia-glx-config enable' ?
[08:15] <dedekind> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[08:15] <Mantice> Im using it the moment amarok is the best mp3 player.
[08:15] <variant> vega__: amarok is very nice, it has a lot of cool features
[08:15] <vega__> Amarok does not seem to be installing very well.
[08:15] <redecho> Hi !!!!    Sorry for my bad English. I am French. I'm looking for a good Soft for eDonkey/eMule network, under Edgy Eft
[08:15] <vega__> When I try to download it with synaptic I get this error:
[08:15] <khaije1> dedekind: it needs to be in xorg.conf first (confusing yes, i know)
[08:15] <Mantice> Could some one help me install cd emu http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1681706 ????
[08:15] <variant> Mantice: i wouldnt say best, but out of the big ones with context browsers it is best
[08:16] <dedekind> so my xorg.conf has my driver listed as nv
[08:16] <vega__> Could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade
[08:16] <dedekind> what should it be
[08:16] <vega__> then it shows several depends that say 'not installable'
[08:16] <vega__> i can give you the names if you want
[08:16] <khaije1> redecho: i'd reccomend apollon ( a kde app ) it has plugins for everything
[08:16] <variant> dedekind: that means not 3d acceleration
[08:16] <variant> dedekind: you are using the free drivers
[08:16] <redecho> khaije1: thanks, i'll try
[08:16] <phillipc> I have this route: map.connect '/:words', :controller=>"definitions",:action=>"index", which works fine, except when there's a comma in the url, e.g. /word1,word2
[08:16] <phillipc> why would that not get picked up?
[08:17] <porto88> anyone willing to help a noob with this? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-28374.html
[08:17] <dedekind> so what do I change it to for the 3d-accel :)
[08:17] <iarwain> anyone knows about chroot?
[08:17] <Mantice> variant: I looked at xmms and beep and I was let down I thought they could have done a better job at trying to imitate winamp they could have done something special.
[08:17] <KHatfull> Howdy
[08:17] <khaije1> dedekind: yes, you'll need to replace nv with nvidia , enable it, then restat the display mgt
[08:17] <dedekind> nvidia?
[08:17] <raghu206> my istanbul abruptly closes when i am trying to save the video do someone pls solve the problem
[08:17] <dedekind> kk
[08:17] <phillipc> sorry wrong chan
[08:17] <variant> Mantice: what like
[08:17] <khaije1> :-)
[08:17] <dedekind> brb
[08:17] <Mantice> variant: like Amarok.
[08:17] <variant> Mantice: there are other winamp clones
[08:17] <SkyDrifter> roryy, thank you for your help, I tried from the terminal to start the gdm gui, but /etc/init.d/gdm start was not the correct command
[08:17] <porto88> hi all
[08:17] <Mantice> variant: yeah the forks off beep are good.
[08:17] <dedekind> what is the easiest way to restart the display without rebooting?
[08:18] <KHatfull> Any tips for an SMP install other than add the 686 SMP kernel after a desktop install?
[08:18] <variant> Mantice: the are all filling a nich, not everyone wants somthing like amarok, like i said. i use cplay
[08:18] <iarwain> dedekind: ctrl-alt-backspace
[08:18] <Mantice> variant: whats cplay like ?
[08:18] <dedekind> brb
[08:18] <porto88> anyone willing to help a noob with this? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-28374.html
[08:18] <roryy> SkyDrifter: I recommend looking in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf and see if you see an option to change this behaviour.  Be sure to back it up first
[08:18] <variant> Mantice: http://mask.tf.hut.fi/~flu/hacks/cplay/
[08:19] <vega__> I'm trying to install amarok but having problems with the package manager.
[08:19] <roryy> SkyDrifter: is gdm not running at all?
[08:19] <SkyDrifter> yes, thank you, can you tell me how to get the shell?
[08:19] <vega__> It says that some of its dependancies are "not installable".
[08:19] <variant> Mantice: http://static.flickr.com/46/187078277_03f98f502e_m.jpg
[08:19] <dedekind> wonderful!
[08:19] <dedekind> works, thanks
[08:19] <iarwain> :)
[08:19] <variant> SkyDrifter: open gnome-terminal
[08:19] <Mantice> variant: is it a command line player
[08:19] <roryy> SkyDrifter: I don't understand that question, sorry
[08:19] <SkyDrifter> rorry, it says theat gdm is running, but I can't get the gui
[08:19] <dedekind> I think I remember having that same trouble 2-3 years ago when I gave up linux the first time :)
[08:19] <dedekind> should have remembered
[08:19] <variant> Mantice: no, it has a graphical interface using the curses widget library
[08:20] <iarwain> lol :)
[08:20] <variant> Mantice: it just doesnt require x
[08:20] <Mantice> variant: Hehe thats cool.
[08:20] <iarwain> dedekind: it's not that hard, once you remember =)
[08:20] <roryy> SkyDrifter: You can switch to the graphical (X) screen with Alt-F7 from the terminal, but there you'll see that network chooser
[08:20] <variant> Mantice: it's not bad
[08:20] <SkyDrifter> from the terminal, I don't know how to bring up the /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
[08:20] <roryy> SkyDrifter: oh, i see
[08:20] <SkyDrifter> roryy*
[08:20] <variant> SkyDrifter: nano -w /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
[08:20] <roryy> SkyDrifter: something like 'sudo nano /etc/gdm/gdm.conf' -- but do back it up first
[08:20] <dedekind> glad to see the nvidia drivers have vastly improved
[08:21] <root> prv
[08:21] <Mantice> How do I check my kernal in the console ?
[08:21] <variant> Mantice: uname -a
[08:21] <SkyDrifter> thank you roryy, back soon
=== root is now known as mepis
[08:21] <mepis> exit
[08:21] <mepis> by ALL :)
[08:21] <stevr1it> hi, i have problems with edgy gnome. When form gnome i try to update it say there are some updates waiting but: the repositories are not correct and id does not work. if i do it from apt-get update and upgrade everything is ok. Any suggestion to correct this bug?
[08:21] <SkyDrifter> and thank you variant
[08:23] <Mantice> variant: Thanks, It seams I cant install cd emu because I have a slightly newer kernal.
[08:23] <variant> Mantice: cd emu?
[08:23] <variant> Mantice: to mount an iso or something?
[08:23] <variant> Mantice: mount -o loop /path/to/image.iso
[08:23] <Mantice> variant: Its a program that lets you mount iso's, and mdf's and every type else.
[08:24] <roryy> it's to back your emu up to cd
[08:24] <Mantice> variant: I need it to mount mdf files.
[08:24] <variant> Mantice: never tried with that, what filetype is it? medium density fiber board? ;)
[08:24] <variant> roryy: what?
[08:25] <roryy> variant: nm, just a joke
[08:25] <iarwain> Hi, does anybody know how to make this work?
[08:25] <iarwain> sudo chroot edit
[08:25] <iarwain> chroot: cant exec command `/bin/bash':access denied
[08:25] <sonick> hello evryone
[08:25] <Mantice> variant: hahaha, its for the alchoal120 % format it gets the physical data off the disk as well for copy protection.
[08:25] <KHatfull> no tips for SMP installs?
[08:25] <variant> iarwain: that is not the correct way to use chroot
[08:25] <variant> Mantice: i see
[08:25] <iarwain> variant: how should i do it then?
[08:26] <variant> iarwain: what are you trying to do exactly?
[08:26] <Mantice> richard@richard-ubuntu:~/Desktop/cdemu-0.8$ make
[08:26] <Mantice> Makefile:31: *** You'll need sources for your (at least 2.6.16) kernel.  Stop.
[08:26] <iarwain> varian: trying to customize my live-cd
[08:26] <porto88> could someone please tell me how to install imwheel via apt?
[08:26] <iarwain> porto88: sudo aptitude install imwheel
[08:26] <porto88> thanks
[08:27] <iarwain> np =)
[08:27] <roryy> Mantice: have you installed 'linux-headers-generic' ?
[08:27] <Mantice> roryy: just doing that now :)
[08:27] <iarwain> variant: how should i do it then?
[08:27] <variant> iarwain: i see, the best way to do that imo is to install ubunut, set it up the way you like and then run the scripts from www.linux-live.org which will create a live cd of your pre installed system (any distro) the resulting live cd will be much much faster than the official ubuntu ones too
[08:27] <ce_patah> hi
[08:27] <variant> iarwain: install ubuntu i ment to say not ubunut
[08:27] <variant> :)
[08:27] <Jordan_U> KHatfull: Do you just need to know how to install an SMP kernel?
[08:28] <iarwain> variant: but that's not really what i would want. I'd like to just learn how to custumize my live-cd =)
[08:28] <variant> KHatfull: if your using edgy your already using an SMP kernel
[08:28] <variant> iarwain: i see,  i have never done that but i can explain to you how to use chroot
[08:29] <iarwain> variant: please tell me what i am doing wrong :D
[08:29] <KHatfull> Jordan: I know to get the SMP kernel via synaptic, but I read in the forums that the generic kernel also covers SMP systems....I'm not quite sure which to beleive
[08:29] <variant> iarwain: chroot means to change the root directory (/) to be somwhere else in the real filesystem.
[08:29] <KHatfull> variant: ah, ok, some of the forum posts must be older then...
[08:29] <KHatfull> my SMP mobo is on the way, juts getting ready for it.
[08:29] <Jordan_U> KHatfull: Just open System monitor, if you see two CPU's you are good :)
[08:29] <variant> iarwain: you use it like this (as root or with sudo) chroot /mnt/newroot
[08:30] <variant> iarwain: where newroot is the partition you want to become the fake / (root) of your filesystem
[08:30] <sugoruyo> when beryl won't draw window decoration and in general won't work where do i go to get some help/docs about problems with it?
[08:30] <iarwain> variant: could it also be used like this: sudo chroot /home/iarwain/music/livecd/edit ?
[08:30] <variant> sugoruyo: #ubuntu-xgl
[08:30] <Jordan_U> sugoruyo: #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[08:30] <variant> iarwain: if there is a directory called edit then yes
[08:31] <KHatfull> Jordan: thanks, came across a deal on eBay, couldn;t pass it up, and I have 2GB of ECC RAM hanging around here...server SMP boards are about the only thing to get to support PC133 ECC chips ;-)
[08:31] <sugoruyo> thx
[08:31] <iarwain> variant: there is.. but i just keep getting that error -_-'
[08:31] <variant> iarwain: it will use /bin/bash as your default shell iirc and ubuntu uses /bin/dash
[08:31] <roryy> iarwain: does /home/iarwain/music/livecd/edit/bin/bash have execute permissions ?
[08:31] <Flannel> variant: only edgy uses dash by default
[08:31] <variant> roryy: thats now how it works
[08:31] <variant> Flannel: ah, ok
[08:31] <iarwain> variant:  yes
[08:32] <KHatfull> Jordan: I have this thing for playing with older hardware ;-)
[08:32] <roryy> variant: you're sure?
[08:32] <variant> roryy: yuup
[08:32] <variant> roryy: make an empty directory somwhere and do chroot /mnt/whateverdirhere
[08:33] <max__> hi, i run KDE and i  put a new motherboard in my computer and everything is going fine except i cant get any sound... i even put in another card in a PCI slot to see if it was the onboard sound cards problem but i cant get any sound off ther sound card either
[08:33] <roryy> variant: i get the error iarwain does ;)
[08:33] <variant> roryy: become root first with sudo -i
[08:33] <roryy> well, not quite: cannot run command `/bin/bash': No such file or directory
[08:33] <roryy> 
[08:33] <variant> iarwain: become root with sudo -i first
[08:33] <iarwain> variant: ok
[08:33] <variant> roryy: chroot /mnt/newdirhere /bin/bash
[08:33] <Mantice> Urh the dgen sega emulater has no gui.
[08:33] <variant> roryy: the default is to use /bin/bash, your setup must be wrong :)
[08:33] <paradizelost> hey, has anyone pulled off dual-monitor on ATI using FGLRX on Xgl?
[08:34] <paradizelost> and don't say #ubuntu-xgl, cuz the room is DEAD
[08:34] <paradizelost> thanks
[08:34] <roryy> variant: hrm. nope, that doesn't work either
[08:34] <variant> paradizelost: maybe at this time it is, i have used it before quite successfuly
[08:34] <iarwain> variant: and now?
[08:34] <max__> hi, i run KDE and i  put a new motherboard in my computer and everything is going fine except i cant get any sound... i even put in another card in a PCI slot to see if it was the onboard sound cards problem but i cant get any sound off ther sound card either
[08:34] <paradizelost> it's been dead for the past few days
[08:34] <Jordan_U> paradizelost: Ok then, #beryl ;)
[08:34] <tamacracker> Hey guys, is it possible to check Hotmail messages through Evolution email program?
[08:34] <variant> iarwain: chroot /path/to/your/new/root /bin/bash
[08:34] <paradizelost> it's not a beryl issue, it's an Xgl issue...
[08:35] <variant> roryy: hmm, what command you using exactly?
[08:35] <iarwain> max__: see #kubuntu
[08:35] <roryy> variant: are you trying these commands yourself ?
=== eno is now known as eno-zzz
[08:35] <variant> roryy: no, i just know that they work
[08:35] <iarwain> variant: does not work. "not a dir"
[08:35] <Flannel> tamacracker: you need a hotmail scraper sort of thing.  There's one in the repository, I believe.
[08:35] <roryy> 'chroot /root/tmp /bin/bash'  -- and yes, /root/tmp exist
[08:35] <roryy> variant: please try them
[08:35] <variant> iarwain: you need to specify the directory you want to chroot to
[08:35] <max__> iarwain: kubuntu is dead
[08:35] <tamacracker> flannel hotail scraper? hm... ill check it out real quick
[08:35] <iarwain> max__: maybe now, but it will be revived =)
[08:36] <variant> iarwain: chroot /PATH/TO/DIRECTORYHERE
[08:36] <iarwain> variant: i did -_-'
[08:36] <roryy> iarwain: i believe variant is incorrect
[08:36] <ce_broken> I need a friend
[08:36] <Jordan_U> paradizelost: But I would expect that people in #beryl would know how to troubleshoot XGL ( or do they say they only do beryl ? )
[08:36] <Xaphoo> does anyone know if Beryl will be in Feisty?
[08:36] <variant> iarwain: chroot /home/iarwain/music/livecd/edid/ /bin/bash
[08:36] <Flannel> tamacracker: Ah, the one I was thinking about is for yahoo:  http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/mail/fetchyahoo  I imagine it's possible with hotmail too
[08:36] <roryy> iarwain: as far as I know, one needs to create a self-contained 'root' under the place one chroots too
[08:36] <variant> Xaphoo: aparantly
[08:36] <roryy> iarwain: including all the libraries bash needs to link to, for example
[08:37] <Xaphoo> good... it will be nice to have it seamlessly integrated
[08:37] <paradizelost> haven't checked in there, but i've checked in #xgl and it's dead as well...
[08:37] <tamacracker> flannel is there a site I can look up for the hotmail version?
[08:37] <variant> roryy: you do not need to copy any files accross if thats what your saying, you will just have to take my word for it on that one
[08:37] <vega__> Can someone help me install amarok?
[08:37] <Xaphoo> I got beryl working well very easily with the nvidia beta, but it's still quite buggy, not ready I think
[08:37] <roryy> variant: i don't need to take your word; I'm trying it and it doesn't work
[08:37] <variant> Xaphoo: the nvidia beta, yes that sounds buggy
[08:37] <Xaphoo> I mean it used to be beta, now it's not
[08:37] <roryy> variant: please try these commands you are recommending; it won't take a moment
[08:37] <iarwain> variant: the command gives me the same error ..
[08:37] <eggzeck> vega__: apt-cache search amarok
[08:37] <Xaphoo> it's the latest nvidia driver with built in xgl type capability
[08:37] <variant> roryy: you must be doinng somthing wrong, im not trying to be big headed but i have used gnu/linux for years and know for a cast iron fact that i am right
[08:37] <Xaphoo> so you don't need to worry about xgl.... you just install beryl
[08:38] <variant> iarwain: what error exactly?
[08:38] <eggzeck> vega__: if you see the package, install it: sudo apt-get install amarok
[08:38] <vega__> It says some of its depends are not installable.
[08:38] <iarwain> variant: chroot:can't exec command '/bin/bash': access denied
[08:38] <Flannel> tamacracker: heh, google?  Here's one:  It's just a perl script, so even though the deb is for debian, it should work... or, well, in theory ;)  http://dir.filewatcher.com/d/Debian/all/mail/gotmail_0.6.6-6_all.deb.17386.html
[08:38] <khaije1> Xaphoo: aiglx works as well :-)
[08:39] <tamacracker> thanks flannel :D
[08:39] <variant> iarwain: you are root?
[08:39] <khaije1> it didn't used to, but it does now
[08:39] <Xaphoo> yes but it's not needed with nvidia 1-0.9 drivers (I think that's the number)
[08:39] <max__> hi, i run KDE and i  put a new motherboard in my computer and everything is going fine except i cant get any sound... i even put in another card in a PCI slot to see if it was the onboard sound cards problem but i cant get any sound off ther sound card either
[08:39] <iarwain> variant: yes
[08:39] <vega__> The depends that cannot be installed are: ruby, python-qt3, and libifp4
[08:39] <variant> what the hell, is ubuntu messed up or somthing?
[08:39] <Xaphoo> 1.0-9xx
[08:39] <variant> it works here on gentoo, slackware and slax
[08:40] <iarwain> variant: about chroot? i don't know =(
[08:40] <variant> roryy: I admit that if ubuntu does somthing different to default then that could be a problem
[08:40] <eggzeck> vega__: All of those packages can be installed also.
[08:41] <roryy> variant: all i remember about chroot from a year or so ago was lots of pain with ldconfig and other things
[08:41] <vega__> It says they cannot be installed.  Thats why I need help.
[08:41] <eggzeck> vega__: Did you try installing them seperately?
[08:41] <variant> omg.. roryy sorry, i think you are correct
[08:41] <vega__> Yes I did.
[08:41] <vega__> But I forgot what went wrong, let me do it again.
[08:41] <iarwain> vega__: stupid question maybe, but have you enabled multiverse?
[08:42] <vega__> Yes I have enabled multiverse.
[08:42] <iarwain> variant: lol :)
[08:42] <iarwain> vega__: sorry then :D

[08:43] <variant> iarwain: i am at work :(
[08:43] <roryy> iarwain: maybe install 'bash-static' and use that to get your chroot going at first
[08:44] <vega__> Okay when I tried to install libruby here's the error I got:
[08:44] <variant> god dammit, i have been usurped

[08:44] <roryy> iarwain: copy /bin/bash* (bash-static or something) to your chroot directory, and run 'chroot $yourdir /bin/bash-static'
[08:45] <iarwain> roryy:gonna try that right away =)
[08:45] <roryy> iarwain: hrm. actually, you might need /dev/* entries too
[08:45] <variant> roryy: iarwain: you might want to install jailer, it does it for you
[08:46] <variant> roryy: iarwain: apt-get isntall jailer
[08:46] <roryy> iarwain: ah-ha. I'd go with that 'jailer' idea. Setting up a chroot is a bit of work
[08:46] <iarwain> variant: lol, trying that first then :d
[08:46] <Corporal_Dirge> Ug, Nautilus crashes whenever there's a .swf file it's trying to make an icon for.
[08:46] <umops> Does anyone know of  a tool to automatically take the list of added users and adds them to samba with same username and pw?
[08:46] <iarwain> variant: and now?
[08:46] <variant> yeah, i dont know wtf i was talking about before... :(
[08:46] <variant> iarwain: read the man page ;)

[08:47] <iarwain> variant: the man page doesn't give me much info :s

[08:50] <tonyyarusso> variant: They're in another country from me, so probably safe ;)
[08:50] <variant> tonyyarusso: don't be too sure
[08:50] <ivx> hey if i have the x86 version of ubuntu but have a 64 bit processor do i have to do a complete reinstall or can i switch or what?
[08:50] <ivx> to get 64 bit version
[08:51] <variant> ivx: might be a good idea to reinstall, but back up your data and try migrating instead first
[08:51] <ivx> variant how do i do this migrate?
[08:51] <variant> ivx: with ubuntu i have no idea
[08:52] <ivx> variant, alright i'll google it
[08:52] <variant> jeeze, i am just goin to get some coffe, later all
[08:52] <iarwain> variant: i did this => add the 'edit' folder to the .conf, and typed "jailer edit"
[08:52] <variant> ivx: it's not a specify technique that i was sugesting
[08:52] <variant> iarwain: what happen?
[08:52] <iarwain> variant: output given is this: "Using config file: edit"
[08:53] <ivx> variant, i will just try to reinstall, will all the same stuff work with 64 bit version as the x86?
[08:54] <variant> ivx: youw ill ahve issues with codecs and some other stuff but it can all be worked around, sometimes messily
[08:54] <iarwain> ivx: it's better to stay with x86, as it is easier to set-up, and not everything will from directly
[08:54] <variant> iarwain: you need to set the location of your chroot in the config
[08:54] <ThomasPorter> Hi, how would I make a script for a chron, that will locate all htdocs directories and if this file doesn't exsist, copy it to that directory?
[08:54] <iarwain> variant: and how would i go about that?
[08:54] <variant> iarwain: Root: /path/to/your/directory/you/want/to/chroot/to
[08:54] <iarwain> variant: done that already =)
[08:55] <ivx> iarwain or variant, well will there be any advantages, like will it run faster or anything
[08:55] <Targ> hi Newbie here
[08:55] <iarwain> ivx: not really
[08:55] <variant> ivx: if your running an very heavy database load or somthing then yes, otherwise no
[08:55] <Targ> found setup very easy as it was done for me LOL
[08:56] <ivx> variant, just my notebook, i think i will just hold, thank you
[08:56] <ivx> iarwain thanks
[08:56] <variant> coffee time
[08:56] <Targ> Chance of helpingme with mail issue
[08:57] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Whats the problem?
[08:57] <tamacracker> flannel: forgive me for my noobness but what do I do at this page: http://www.filewatcher.com/m/gotmail_0.6.6-6_all.deb.17386.0.0.html
[08:58] <Targ> Ok the mail prog that comes with ubuntu keep timing out
[08:58] <paradizelost> hey all, how do i manually start up an X session on a secondary display?
[08:58] <paradizelost> I.e. PCI 1:0:0:1
[08:58] <Targ> it receives mail no worries it just can't seem to send them
[08:59] <ThomasPorter> Targ: As in a server?
[08:59] <Targ> Well the error message is the the SMTP lookup failed or something close to that
[08:59] <Ratlord> Hmm can someone help me with something if they have time?
[08:59] <Targ> Host lookup failed: smtp@optusnet.com.au: Name or service not known
[08:59] <Targ> Could not connect to optusnet.com.au: Connection refused
[08:59] <Targ> there is the message
[08:59] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Are you sure optusnet.com.au is correct?
[09:00] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Did you try using a different accout?
[09:00] <Targ> I don't think I have set anything as smtp@otusnet.com.au the smtp settings are mail.optusnet.com.au
[09:00] <Targ> yeah its the same isp I use in windows outlook
[09:01] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Try using mail.optusnet.com.au
[09:01] <Targ> yeah but I only have 2 with optusnet
[09:01] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Are you behind a firewall?
[09:01] <Targ> yeah thats what I have in the smtp sending field
[09:01] <Targ> a router with nat
[09:01] <Ratlord> Hehe. 811 people, most of them idle...Creepy
[09:02] <ThomasPorter> Ratlord: isn't it.
[09:02] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Is your windows box on the same router?
[09:02] <Ratlord> Anyone have any time to spare to help a poor noob out?
[09:02] <Targ> yeah on the same pc I'm currently using dual boot
[09:02] <ThomasPorter> Ratlord: What with?
[09:03] <Targ> till I make the transfer
[09:03] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Hmmm
[09:03] <Ratlord> Just getting the thing installed. I can't even get to the desktop. I'll always get this black screen with some messages, then this screen will pop up saying that X Server or something is broken
[09:03] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Tried using authenticated SMTP?
[09:03] <Ratlord> Anyone know how to fix that?
[09:03] <Targ> run zonealarm suite on windows for full featured firewall nothing here yet only installed today getting sick on Microcrap virus'
[09:04] <Targ> not sure how to set that up
[09:04] <ThomasPorter> Targ: Sorry, I'm not sure try ##Linux
[09:04] <Ratlord> Well, maybe not broken...More like not setup correctly I think it said
[09:04] <senorprog> ratlord: what are the messages you're seeing? i'm having xserver problems too
[09:04] <ThomasPorter> Ratlord: Whats the exact message?
[09:04] <Ratlord> Hmm let me get it...
[09:05] <Ratlord> Brb
[09:05] <user-land> How can i verify if there are really 'too many open files', as eMule reports ?
[09:05] <Targ> OKies
[09:05] <Targ> ta anyways
[09:05] <ThomasPorter> Np
[09:05] <senorprog> Xserver question and mythtv: after i log in as my mythtv user, can't launch any apps from the gui. click Terminal, cursor spins for a bit and then nothing happens
[09:06] <Jordan_U> The gnome power applet thinks I am still connected to my power supply when my laptop is actually running on battery power, so when it runs out of battery, my computer shuts down from loss of power instead of gnome suspending my machine.
[09:06] <senorprog> seems like it can't launch the app window
[09:06] <senorprog> anyone know where i'd look to find out which error is occurring?
[09:06] <Ratlord> Ok. Got it. Do you want the black screen before the X Server error message, or the X Server error message?
[09:06] <Ratlord> Or both?
[09:06] <Jordan_U> And it now seems to be magically fixed, thanks guys, you really do work miracles ;)
[09:07] <quinnster> Is there anything similar to ZoneAlarm on Windows?  Something that can alert you what programs are requesting internet access, that is.
[09:07] <senorprog> ratlord: xserver error msg to start
[09:07] <Ratlord> Ok
[09:08] <Ratlord> Failed to start the X Server (Your graphical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X Server out put to diagnose the problem? < Yes >    < No >
[09:08] <travkin> lol
[09:08] <travkin> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:09] <senorprog> did you view the output?
[09:09] <Ratlord> I told my friend this, and he thought it was either my video driver, or my graphics card. I didn't feel like going in to view the out put incase I screwed something up even more
[09:09] <Ratlord> So, no.
[09:09] <Ratlord> Should I have?
[09:09] <Ratlord> Hmm probably now that I think about it
[09:09] <senorprog> yeah, you can't screw it up by looking at its messages
[09:10] <Ratlord> Hehe. Well, I could put the liveCD back in, get to that screen, write it down, and come back and tell you guys?
[09:10] <ompaul> Ratlord, what kind of video card have you got, and which versoin are you using?
[09:10] <senorprog> have you googled the problem?
[09:10] <e-type> hi all
[09:10] <senorprog> usually when I screw up xserver i can generally just tell it to reconfig and it sorts itself out
[09:11] <senorprog> I believe this is the right command for that:
[09:11] <senorprog> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:11] <senorprog> but before you run off and try that, someone else want to confirm or deny?
[09:12] <Ratlord> Well, I'm using a laptop. So, I have: Mobile Intel(R) 945GM Express Chipset Family. :/ And yes, I've tried googling the proglem. Nothing
[09:13] <bintut> hello all..
[09:13] <Targ> anyone else able to help me with setup of evolution mail accounts ..
[09:13] <Targ> my mail keeps timing out say smtp lookup failed
[09:13] <senorprog> i think that was the line i used to fix my xserver.... :\
[09:13] <bintut> is there a documentation on how to setup the ltsp bundled in ubuntu edgy eft?
[09:13] <Ratlord> So, could the chipset be the problem?
[09:13] <roryy> senorprog: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' looks right to me
[09:14] <Targ> Please I'm a first timer here and in need of help to make my transition easier
[09:14] <Ratlord> Ok. So, if I put that in, it should work?
[09:14] <Ratlord> Same, Targ
[09:14] <senorprog> ratlord: maybe but i tend to suspect hardware last
[09:14] <user-land> What can i do when there are 'too many open files' ?
[09:14] <senorprog> ratlord: if you can log in then try entering that line, following the prompts and see if that helps
[09:14] <senorprog> can't make it worse ;)
[09:15] <Ratlord> Hehe. Ok. Where would I put that in though?
[09:15] <Ratlord> The only chance I see is that black screen...
[09:15] <roryy> one way is to boot into rescue mode
[09:15] <senorprog> boot into rescue mode, log in, enter that line
[09:16] <Ratlord> Ok...How do I boot into rescue mode?
[09:16] <roryy> Ratlord: do you see a menu when your computer boots?
[09:16] <Ratlord> The Ubuntu menu? with the "start or install ubuntu" and stuff?
[09:17] <paradizelost> Ok, i'm getting somewhhere on the dual-screen on aTI thing, the TV is display 0.1, how do i start a gnome-session there?
[09:17] <paradizelost> it says there's already a display manager running
[09:17] <roryy> Ratlord: no, when you boot from the hard-drive.  Have you installed ubuntu?
[09:18] <Ratlord> Nope. Can't install it. The X Server thing gets in the way.
[09:18] <senorprog> ahh, you don't have it installed yet
[09:18] <paradizelost> I'd be happy with a standard X display on the TV... all it's for is playing videos...
[09:18] <roryy> bintut: does this help? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP
[09:18] <Flannel> Ratlord: grab the alternate CD, it doesn't need to boot a liveCD to install
[09:18] <Ratlord> My friend said something about installing it from the command line...No clue what he means though
[09:19] <Ratlord> alternate CD...?
[09:19] <roryy> Ratlord: although you can install from the Live CD, it would be wise to first find out if your video hardware will work with Ubuntu
[09:19] <Ratlord> *nods*
[09:19] <Flannel> Ratlord: yeah, alternate CD.  Same place you downloaded the Desktop ISO, grab the Alternate ISO.
[09:19] <roryy> Ratlord: when you use the LiveCD, do you get to the graphical user interface, or not ?
[09:20] <Ratlord> Nope.
[09:20] <senorprog> Intel seems to think that chipset will work: http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/user.html
[09:20] <Ratlord> The only thing graphic I get is the menu with the "start or install ubuntu"
[09:20] <senorprog> but yeah, the advice to try the alternate CD is good indeed
[09:20] <Ratlord> Ok
[09:21] <Unimatrix9> knoppix?
[09:21] <Unimatrix9> :)
[09:21] <FantasticFoo> sorry, incredibly stupid question, but if i've written a simple little c++ program and i want to compile it with g++ blah.cpp, how do i add optimization flags like -ffast-math
[09:21] <Unimatrix9> Ratlord : what kind of pc do you have?
[09:22] <roryy> FantasticFoo: 'g++ -ffast-math blah.cpp -o blah'
[09:22] <roryy> FantasticFoo: I'd recommend -O1 or -O2 instead; you can always play with the weirder optimizations later
[09:23] <Ratlord> Dell Inspiron E1705
[09:23] <FantasticFoo> roryy: well see, i've written a prime number generator just for fun and i'm seeing how fast i can get it to spit out the numbers
[09:23] <FantasticFoo> roryy: i figured ffast-math might work
[09:23] <FantasticFoo> roryy: well brb
[09:23] <Unimatrix9> ratlord, did you try to get into the menu by pressing F1 or F2?
[09:24] <roryy> FantasticFoo: i suspect -ffast-math is for floating point, not integers
[09:24] <Ratlord> Yeah, I pressed all of the F1-6 options
[09:24] <Unimatrix9> ah ok
[09:24] <dam> i need help to get WOW working under ubuntu
[09:24] <grant> hi, can someone recomend a good p2p file sharer for ubuntu? thanks
[09:25] <nastt> what's the package name for openssh server?
[09:25] <bintut> roryy: i just checked that site but it seems it uses the ltsp-4.x and not the latest one that is bundled with ltsp-5.x
[09:25] <bintut> roryy: i just checked that site but it seems it uses the ltsp-4.x and not the latest one that is bundled with the edgy eft i mean
[09:25] <saleh> hi guys, i'm completely new in linux and ubuntu and need help to install openGL...
[09:26] <yakumo> anyone know how to backup my apt-get install?
[09:26] <grant> hi, can someone recomend a good p2p file sharer for ubuntu? thanks
[09:26] <Unimatrix9> Ratlord, try knoppix if you dont hang unto brand names, and just want linux ( or kanotix, wich is nice too )
[09:26] <Ratlord> Ok, sorry if this is a bit annoying, but I'm still confused about the alternate CD...I'm at the download section of the site, clicked on the mirror I used before...Don't see anything that says alternate CD...Unless you mean the Other Installation option...
[09:26] <Unimatrix9> for live cd
[09:27] <saleh> how to install openGL in ubuntu???
[09:27] <senorprog> ratlord: you're looking for something like 'ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso'
[09:27] <senorprog> or 6.10 if you're up in there
[09:28] <roryy> bintut: hmm, sorry.  that's all i can easily find on the wiki
[09:28] <Ratlord> Ok
[09:28] <bintut> roryy: it's ok.. thanks anyway.. :)
[09:28] <grant> hi, can someone recomend a good p2p file sharer for ubuntu? thanks
[09:29] <wickedpuppy> ktorrent or azureus
[09:29] <grant> wickedpuppy, thanks
[09:29] <Flannel> Ratlord: you'll need to go through the "other install option" yeah, I suppose they did add that extra layer of clicks
[09:30] <saleh> what r the packages for openGL???
[09:31] <Unimatrix9> frostwire - a kind of p2p
[09:31] <saleh> what r the packages for openGL???
[09:31] <drivera90> I like Frostwire.
[09:31] <Ratlord> Ok, Flannel
[09:31] <user-land> Where can i use "ulimit -a" ?
[09:31] <knix> saleh: for what? to get it to work? write opengl software? what?
[09:31] <Unimatrix9> http://www.frostwire.com/
[09:31] <Flannel> !frostwire | Unimatrix9, drivera90, and... um... grant, I suppose.
[09:31] <ubotu> Unimatrix9, drivera90, and... um... grant, I suppose.: frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[09:32] <saleh> knix: i want to install and i'm new in linux
[09:32] <Unimatrix9> try the live cd version, before you install
[09:32] <knix> What kind of graphics card do you have saleh ?
[09:32] <Unimatrix9> and see if you like / and can work with it
[09:32] <Ratlord> Ah. Ok. I found the alternate thing now. Thanks
[09:33] <Xaphoo> hmm, how can I get the kernel to recognize my dual-core processor?
[09:33] <Unimatrix9> Ratlord, and hopefully it works for you...
[09:33] <saleh> knix: ATI mobility radeon 9200
[09:33] <Ratlord> Hehe. I hope so too
[09:33] <Xaphoo> I installed the linux-generic kernel with apt, but I reboot and nothing changes... I don't think that kernel is being used
[09:33] <knix> saleh: glx isn't working through dri? run glxgears and see if it's smooth
[09:34] <senorprog> saleh: to get glx running i followed these instructions:
[09:34] <senorprog> http://nekoder.blogspot.com/
[09:35] <senorprog> make sure to back up your xorg.conf first ;)
[09:35] <SlimG> what file should i append commands that shall happen before login prompt?
[09:35] <yakumo> hi i install eclipse using apt-get install. is there a way to install it to another pc without using apt-get istall again?? pls help
[09:35] <GNeu> SlimG, You can just use System > Pref > Sessions
[09:35] <user-land> My Ubuntu limits 'open files' to 1024. How can i change that ?
[09:36] <GNeu> SlimG, you can add commands there. Nice and simple.
[09:36] <SlimG> GNeu: It's a ubuntu server with ssh connection
[09:36] <GNeu> SlimG, That makes life more interesting
[09:36] <Flannel> SlimG: you want stuff to happen when the computer boots up?
[09:36] <Xaphoo> I installed the linux-generic kernel with apt, but I reboot and nothing changes... I don't think that kernel is being used... how oI change what kernel gets booted in to?
[09:37] <SlimG> Flannel: yes
[09:37] <nastt> i installed 6.10 but ssh daemon isn't installed, and apt-get says openssh-server isn't a valid package
[09:37] <Corporal_Dirge> Anyone know why Nautilus crashes when it sees a shockwave file?
[09:37] <SlimG> Flannel: but BEFORE the login prompt
[09:37] <Targ> I have mail problem in evolution it times out sending mail... can somebody please help me with the setup...
[09:37] <GNeu> SlimG, Oh before login, sorry i didn't read your first message properly
[09:37] <Flannel> nastt: check your repositories
[09:38] <Flannel> nastt: since, openssh-server does exist
[09:38] <senorprog> nastt: do you have all the usual repositories enabled?
[09:38] <nastt> i'm new to ubuntu, not sure how to do that
[09:38] <SlimG> GNeu: np ;)
[09:38] <Xaphoo> HOW do I change it so that it boots into the generic kernel instead of the i386 kernel?
[09:38] <msid> does anybody know why ubuntu 6.10 is significantly slower on boot ? is it the new upstart system? is there anyway to fix it ?
[09:38] <fredl_> hi, my azureus crashes. known problem?
[09:38] <fredl_> An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:
[09:39] <rickyfingers> Targ : first step might be to open a terminal window and type
[09:39] <nastt> senorprog: how would i enable the proper repositories
[09:39] <Xaphoo> this channel is horrible for getting simple questions answered... theyve gotta be complicated questions
[09:39] <rickyfingers> telnet <mailserver> 25
[09:39] <Flannel> Xaphoo: change the default in your grub menu, but Im fairly certain it changed it.
[09:39] <rickyfingers> see if you get a timeout there,
[09:39] <rickyfingers> if you do, your isp is blocking smtp
[09:39] <tamacracker> Hey guys... I can't see my NTFS Drive in my Computer folder
[09:39] <Xaphoo> a grub menu doesn't even pop up
[09:39] <SlimG> msid: in my experience 6.10 is booting significantly faster than 6.06.1
[09:39] <tamacracker> How would I be able to get my NTFS mounted?
[09:39] <Flannel> nastt: pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:39] <Flannel> Xaphoo: It's there, just hidden.  You can hit... escape, I believe, to show it
[09:39] <Targ> OK but what do I type in the terminal to test it ,.. I'm very knew to this
[09:40] <Xaphoo> ok thanks
[09:40] <GNeu> SlimG, So do you want the command executed just before login? once everything has loaded.
[09:40] <senorprog> nastt: google "ubuntu extra repositories" for the details. its on a number of sites
[09:40] <GNeu> SlimG, and as root?
[09:40] <SlimG> GNeu: yes, as root
[09:40] <rickyfingers> targ: do you know the domain name of your mail server, (usually something smtp.....com
[09:40] <Flannel> nastt: you don't need extra repositories.
[09:40] <nastt> senorprog: will do
[09:41] <nastt> ubuntuguide.org who'da thunken
[09:41] <tamacracker> Can anyone help me locate my NTFS drive and then mount it?
[09:41] <Flannel> nastt: just pastebin your sources.list, we'll see why you don't have openssh-server
[09:41] <msid> SlimG: quite the opposite i might say. i removed quit and splash from kernel options to see what is going on during boot. no specific error though, it is simply slower. there is one point that it gets "stuck" for 10" or so, but, rather than that it goes on smoothly. 2' boot time is not acceptable though.
[09:41] <rickyfingers> Targ: lets take a step back. Did you have mail working with a different computer before?
[09:41] <Targ> yeah its mail.optusnet.com.au
[09:41] <senorprog> i defer to Flannel
[09:41] <GNeu> SlimG, I havn't done this for a while so, if remember, it had something to do with shells, I think
[09:41] <Targ> yeah this puter in windows
[09:41] <Targ> outlook
[09:41] <rickyfingers> OK, then isp is probably not blocking smtp
[09:41] <fredl_> Hmm, I take it back, azureus does crash with the old ~/.azureus
[09:42] <Targ> the thing that I can't understand is that there doesn't seem to be a place to enter my password
[09:42] <ThomasPorter> How d oI restart DNS?
[09:42] <rickyfingers> Targ: anyway, you just click applications, acessories, terminal
[09:42] <Targ> yep
[09:42] <Targ> \got it started
[09:43] <rickyfingers> targ: and then at the command prompt type telnet mail.optusnet.com.au 25
[09:43] <Targ> OKies
[09:43] <Olathe> How do I permanently set the rows and columns for text consoles (Shift-Alt-F1 and so on) ?
[09:43] <iarwain> variant: hi, sorry i left, i was hungry =)
[09:44] <rickyfingers> u should see something about connecting, just type control ]  to escape out
[09:44] <Targ> yep that seemed to work
[09:44] <Targ> I can get mail but not send
[09:44] <rickyfingers> ok, so it's a problem in your mail client settins
[09:44] <rickyfingers> for sure.
[09:44] <radioaktivstorm> goodmorning all, I have a question: I cant make updates because i apparently have a damaged package that needs to be reinstalled or something, any ideas?
[09:45] <rickyfingers> I would bet there's an error in your outgoing mail server settings is all
[09:45] <bsb003> I have a noob question - I installed ubuntu today, then added another hard drive.  How do I get ubunto to see this new drive?
[09:45] <rickyfingers> but I don't know enough about evolution to help you any further
[09:45] <GNeu> SlimG, /etc/profiles
[09:45] <rickyfingers> bsb003: you need to mount it
[09:45] <Targ> yeah I think its the lack of a password being set but can't findout where to set it
[09:45] <Targ> it gives me the option to remember the password but not set it
[09:46] <rickyfingers> bsb303: but before that, you need to create a file system on the drive
[09:46] <Ratlord> Yay...An hour left...*dies*
[09:46] <rickyfingers> in order for linux to be able to mount it.
[09:46] <tamacracker> Guys after I install: libntfs8, libntfs-gnomevfs and ntfsprogs
[09:46] <Ratlord> At least it isn't going at .5 KB/sec like with that one mirror...
[09:47] <tamacracker> what do I need to do next in order for my NTFS primary master drive to be recognized?
[09:47] <Flannel> !ntfs | tamacracker
[09:47] <tamacracker> It's not showing in the Computer folder
[09:47] <rickyfingers> tama, mount /dev/hdwhatever -t ntfs doesn't work?

[09:48] <nastt> er, ignore the (URL stuff
[09:48] <rickyfingers> Nox2k3 sounds like you've got shared library conflicts
[09:48] <nastt> that's gaim doing dirty things to addresses
[09:48] <SlimG> GNeu: it's either /etc/rc.d or /etc/profile , maby both, thanx for your help :)

[09:49] <Nox2k3> I'm not sure how to go about fixing them on Ubuntu.
[09:49] <GNeu> SlimG, /etc/profile
[09:49] <fijam> hello
[09:49] <rickyfingers> Yeah, that's one of the limitations of using a package manager
[09:49] <iarwain> fijam: hey
[09:49] <Flannel> nastt: you should have openssh, no problem.
[09:50] <Nox2k3> hrm
[09:50] <Flannel> nastt: what do you get with "sudo apt-get install ssh"?
[09:50] <Nox2k3> maybe I should be using libX11.so.6.2.0 instead of libX11.so.6?
[09:50] <fijam> After installing Edgy, I get no logo at startup. Why is that and how to fix it?
[09:50] <youser> how do i open gconf editor
[09:50] <Nox2k3> erm
[09:50] <Nox2k3> they're symlinks and they're all i have
[09:50] <youser> im trying to install mouse pointer themes
[09:50] <Nox2k3> so I doubt its a shared library conflict
[09:50] <youser> any help please
[09:51] <rickyfingers> Can't say, but app is looking for that function in the shared library and it's not there
[09:51] <SlimG> GNeu: thanx again
[09:51] <FantasticFoo> well, this is interesting
[09:51] <Flannel> youser: "gconf-editor" is the command, I believe
[09:51] <rickyfingers> hence the error message
[09:51] <GNeu> SlimG, you worked it out yourself
[09:51] <Nox2k3> Yeah, I'm just wondering why it cares about DPMS and how I tell it to not care.
[09:51] <rickyfingers> so it was compiled against a shared library with the same name as what's on your system,
[09:51] <Nox2k3> Maybe I'll install another SDL version somewhere and link against that one instead.
[09:51] <rickyfingers> but it had different functions in it
[09:52] <nastt> Flannel: that will isntall the server as well?
[09:52] <rickyfingers> I've run into that problem before, with different apps. it's the same thing as dll hell in windows
[09:52] <iarwain> variant: are you still awake? =)
[09:52] <Flannel> nastt: yeah, "ssh" installs client and server
[09:52] <rickyfingers> and sftp, scp too
[09:52] <Nox2k3> Yes I'm aware, but I haven't really done enough with this system to encite it.
[09:52] <nastt> that's what I get for not trying the simple things

[09:53] <FantasticFoo> my prime number generator program runs slower with -ffast-math than without
[09:53] <rickyfingers> youser ssh-keygen
[09:53] <FantasticFoo> actually any optimizations slow down the program
[09:53] <nastt> Flannel: Package ssh is not available, but is referred to by another package
[09:53] <youser> terminal ssh-keygen?
[09:53] <rickyfingers> if you need to generate new keys
[09:53] <iarwain> nastt: sudo apt-cache search ssh
[09:53] <GNeu> youser, you should be able to just drag them into you current theme's folder (~/.icons/*) and then refresh the theme
[09:53] <Flannel> nastt: hmm.  Alright, try "sudo apt-get update"
[09:53] <rickyfingers> if it's complaining about possible main in the middle attack because host key has changed

[09:53] <tamacracker> this is the quickest way possible: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions

[09:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Your rock! - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:54] <rickyfingers> just delete known hosts file
[09:54] <GNeu> they are in their own folders?
[09:54] <tamacracker> ha
[09:54] <tamacracker> gonna restart :D
[09:54] <youser> yes
[09:55] <youser> i was told add them to .icons

[10:00] <daywalker> rickyfingers, when i upgraded from dapper all was good, but i had to re-install the driver to use beryl
[10:01] <kraut> moin
[10:01] <rickyfingers> *shrug* i'm in over my head.  never heard of beryl

[10:02] <loutrine> I'm having FLAC playback problems with Amarok 1.4.4 under Ubuntu Edgy Eft. I don't receive any error, it simply skips to the next song and repeats till it finds one it can play (usually mp3). (#amarok has been of no help so far...)
[10:03] <khaije1> loutrine: i've been watching a threead about this problem, it seems like the problem has been found
[10:03] <loutrine> khaije1, Oh? Got a link to the thread?
[10:03] <graeme> guys, what's the best way to upgrade from breezy ?
[10:04] <loutrine> I had this same problem with Amarok 1.4.2 under Ubuntu Dapper Drake however someone made a patch and posted it on the Ubuntu forums which fixed it but the patch doesn't work under Edgy.
[10:04] <khaije1> loutrine: ya i'm pulling it up now. by any chance do you use grip to rip your flac's?
[10:04] <loutrine> khaije1, I ripped all my FLAC files through CDex under Windows - so no :)
[10:05] <ayaa> wich package does provide "/usr/bin/cc" ? dpkg -S does not provide anything
[10:05] <khaije1> loutrine: crap, this may still apply to you though (link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=210683&page=11)

[10:05] <youser> *invalid file format
[10:05] <khaije1> loutrine: suggests the problem is with the way the files are tagged... i'm not able to test it currently b/c i'm at work, but could you let me know if you experience success?
[10:06] <xarq> is there a 2.6.17-10 kernel for amd64 in the repos, or just the generic kernel?
[10:06] <loutrine> khaije1, certainly. however I'm not able to change any tags as they're on a read only NTFS partition :(
[10:06] <loutrine> but I'll let you know regardless
[10:06] <Xaphoo> How do I change what kernel boots by default?
[10:07] <graeme> charle97: yeah, I guess ...
[10:07] <xarq> Xaphoo: you edit your menu.lst, the "default" number
[10:07] <graeme> I thought that utorrent had a linux version no ?
[10:07] <durrie> I need some help here, I installed Ubuntu on a fresh harddrive, I want to format that drive now to reinstall it to dual boot with XP but Windows no longer lists the harddrive
[10:07] <khaije1> loutrine: thats easy, identify a few that don't normaly play, copy them somewhere writable, try them again (should fail again) then try the fix

[10:08] <loutrine> khaije1, oh, doh! didn't think of that :p
[10:08] <graeme> charle97: ummm ... don't think I'll bother then ...
[10:08] <Xaphoo> xarq: is it the number it is listed in menu.lst ?
[10:08] <fyrestrtr> ThomasPorter: sounds simple enough, are they running?
[10:09] <durrie> Anyone?
[10:09] <xarq> Xaphoo: yes
[10:09] <Xaphoo> like, the first one is 0, the second is 1...

BTW - it's on an IBM ThinkPad T23.
[10:11] <rickyfingers_> tar in a terminal window
[10:11] <youser> ahh
[10:11] <ThomasPorter> fyrestrtr: is that what you mean by zones file? I'm new with DNS.
[10:12] <xarq> solarflare: no, I haven't had any trouble with gmail and firefox2
[10:12] <fyrestrtr> ThomasPorter: you need a zone file, something that identifies your domain and its hosts.
[10:12] <rickyfingers_> but i don't know how to go any further
[10:12] <nastt> Flannel: thanks
[10:12] <graeme> charle97: apt-get upgrade distro ???

[10:13] <xarq> solarflare: netatalk?
[10:13] <fyrestrtr> ThomasPorter: use this http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/bind-zone-file-creator.php
[10:13] <rickyfingers_> youser, if you downloaded the mouse themes as a file like yakety-yak-mouse-themse.tar.bz2
[10:13] <youser> yep
[10:14] <xarq> solarflare: netatalk was the only thing which gave me trouble with firefox crashing
[10:14] <fyrestrtr> solarflare: I don't have that problem, and I'm on T43.
[10:14] <rickyfingers_> the way to uncompress the file is tar -xjf yakety-yak-mouse-themes.tar.bz3

[10:14] <rickyfingers_> youser - typo - I meant .bz2
[10:14] <youser> i can open them with file manager
[10:14] <solarflare> fyrestrtr: Thanks - is that the same display?
[10:14] <NoWhereMan_> hi guys
[10:15] <ThomasPorter> fyrestrtr: "Now either upload a hosts file (max 5 MB):" what does this mean?
[10:15] <fyrestrtr> n0mak: go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and read the instructions there :)
[10:15] <NoWhereMan_> can anybody help with a ralink wireless card and edgy?
[10:15] <xarq> solarflare: hmm... my display was 1400x1050 but that shouldn't matter
[10:15] <fyrestrtr> ThomasPorter: you don't have a hosts file, so just ignore that part.
[10:15] <n0mak> k, I'll try it out fyrestrtr
[10:15] <youser> i can extract them i just dont know how to install them
[10:15] <fyrestrtr> solarflare: I don't know about that, sorry.
[10:15] <rickyfingers_> n0mak - u can also try mplayer, but if you're not comfortable recompiling source code, I wouldn't mess with it.
[10:16] <rickyfingers_> NoWhereMan, what stage of the game are you at?
[10:16] <ThomasPorter> fyrestrtr: Okay, thanks again ;)
[10:16] <rickyfingers_> Do you have a module for the wnic?
[10:16] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, more or less I am at the beginning
[10:16] <khaije1> solarflare: i had many crashes until i uninstalled flash
[10:16] <rickyfingers_> ok first thing, open a terminal window and type iwconfig
[10:16] <NoWhereMan_> the driver have been compiled but I see and hwaddr 00:00:00:00:00
[10:16] <ThomasPorter> fyrestrtr: Once created, where does the file go?
[10:17] <rickyfingers_> see if it says something besides "no wireless extensions" for one of the network interfaces.
[10:17] <solarflare> khaije1: where was the flash from? distro?
[10:17] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, ra0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00
[10:17] <rickyfingers_> nowhereman: if it says "no wireless extensions" for all the interfaces, you know the module for the wnic is not installed
[10:18] <rickyfingers_> installed or loaded.
[10:18] <graeme> Does breezy have a moive player installed ?
[10:18] <khaije1> i think it was via easy-ubuntu im using edgy dist-upgraded from dapper
[10:18] <khaije1> solarflare: ^^
[10:18] <rickyfingers_> nowhereman: ra0 is the interface for your wnic?
[10:18] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, yeah: ra0       RT61 Wireless  ESSID:"" 
[10:19] <fyrestrtr> ThomasPorter: /etc/bind/, and then you edit /etc/bind/named.conf.local and add a line there that refers to your file.
[10:19] <rickyfingers_> ok the all zeros mac address seems fishy to me
[10:19] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, yeah I'm clueless :D
[10:19] <NoWhereMan_> sure it's bad
[10:19] <xarq> does anyone know how to find out when a graphics card will become supported and if anyone is updating the fglrx driver for it?
[10:19] <rickyfingers_> but at this point, you should be able to either go to system->administration->networking
[10:20] <rickyfingers_> and put in your essid, wep key all those configuration goodies, and set ip address or dhcp depending on your setup
[10:20] <rickyfingers_> alternatively, you can use iwconfig/ipconfig to put those settings in manually
[10:20] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, I don't have any connection available ATM I just wanted to do a scan to see if it's working
[10:20] <rickyfingers_> but then they'll get erased on bootup
[10:20] <xarq> I got this sweet graphics card to develop a game for Ubuntu but it's not supported so I can only develop the game for Windows and Mac for now
[10:21] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, but it says scan it's not supported :/
[10:21] <rickyfingers_> in that case, what happens when you do iwlist ra0 scanning?
[10:21] <rickyfingers_> Oh, I see.  Maybe try a different driver.
[10:21] <rickyfingers_> are you using ndiswrapper?
[10:22] <NoWhereMan_> ra0       No scan results
[10:22] <NoWhereMan_> nope, rt61 legacy driver
[10:22] <rickyfingers_> Sounds like it could do the scan. are you certain there's a wireless network in your area?
[10:23] <graeme> upgrading breezy to dapper ... what's the best way ?
[10:23] <rickyfingers_> (one you could see with windoze or something like that?
[10:23] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, it used to be
[10:23] <NoWhereMan_> i mean
[10:23] <NoWhereMan_> it takes no time to do the scan
[10:24] <xarq> graeme: you could dist-upgrade or do a clean install, depends on how much backing up you feel like doing
[10:24] <NoWhereMan_> i guess it doesn't scan at all
[10:24] <SilentDis> hello :)
[10:24] <tobias_> hi! is there any way to make Nautilus have a split screen setup so I can drag/move data easily from one window to another?
[10:24] <rickyfingers_> nowhere man, let me ssh to my laptop with wireless, and see what happens.
[10:24] <roryy> graeme: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:24] <SlimG> does ubuntu i386/amd64 disks install on the intel core based apple computers? if so, are intel core based apple computeres now referred to as pc's ?
[10:24] <xarq> graeme: if your data really matters to you you'll back up in either case though
[10:24] <rickyfingers_> I've got a laptop with intel ipw nic
[10:25] <graeme> xarq: don't care about backing anything up ...
[10:25] <SilentDis> tobias_: i don't believe so, but you can have 2 Nautilus windows open next to each other, and hide the places bar on the right, if that helps.
[10:25] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, I don't know what you are going to do, but do it if you think it would help :D
[10:25] <graeme> what's the best way to 'just do it' ... ?
[10:25] <warlock[S] > Is there a way to see what ports all of my processes are using?
[10:25] <rickyfingers_> NoWhereman, just got same behavior, No scan results.
[10:26] <NoWhereMan_> so?
[10:26] <tobias_> SilentDis: Thanks!
[10:26] <roryy> warlock[S] : 'sudo netstat -tp' is one way
[10:26] <SilentDis> tobias_: nt :)
[10:26] <rickyfingers_> Ah ha, nowhereman:
[10:27] <rickyfingers_> you gots to do sudo iwlist ra0 scanning
[10:27] <rickyfingers_> I got results when I did that
[10:27] <rickyfingers_> and I see there's a linksys somewhere nearby....
=== kosmitek is now known as marcimon
[10:27] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, ra0       Interface doesn't support scanning : Network is down
[10:27] <NoWhereMan_> :'(
[10:28] <rickyfingers_> bummer, then you need a different nic
[10:28] <youser> anyone know how to use compiz?
[10:28] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, please translate in n00b-a-nese
[10:29] <warlock[S] > roryy, that didn't show me much..
[10:29] <xarq> NoWhereMan_: your card isn't supported
[10:29] <rickyfingers_> It's just that not all wireless network interface cards (wnic's) support all the iw commands
[10:29] <roryy> warlock[S] : then not many TCP ports are in use
[10:29] <rickyfingers_> what's more of a pain is they also don't support ethernet bridging
[10:29] <roryy> warlock[S] : err, oops
[10:30] <donjuanxxx> .
[10:30] <NoWhereMan_> xarq, how can you say that?
[10:30] <roryy> warlock[S] : sudo netstat -ltp
[10:30] <rickyfingers_> however, your original question, of whether or not the card is workign
[10:30] <rickyfingers_> is solved
[10:30] <NoWhereMan_> it's an rt61 drv is for rt61
[10:30] <xarq> NoWhereMan_: you asked me to translate into noobanese
[10:30] <warlock[S] > hmm
[10:30] <roryy> warlock[S] : maybe you should just read 'man netstat' ;) to avoid anymore mistakes from me
[10:30] <NoWhereMan_> xarq, thanx then :p
[10:30] <warlock[S] > roryy, mind joining #blalba-talk? so I can shot the output?
[10:31] <rickyfingers_> You know you have a driver running,
[10:31] <xarq> NoWhereMan_: "you need a different nic" == "your card isn't supported"
[10:31] <roryy> warlock[S] : i'm there
[10:31] <rickyfingers_> Nowhereman: here's how to change your mac address
[10:31] <NoWhereMan_> xarq, yes, thanx. I understood :)
[10:31] <warlock[S] > nope, don't see you :p
[10:31] <rickyfingers_> command may or may not work, once again depending on the hardware:
[10:31] <rickyfingers_>     ifconfig eth0 down hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01
[10:31] <rickyfingers_> ifconfig eth0 up
[10:31] <warlock[S] > roryy #warlocky then, try that :)

[10:32] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, that's still strange I shouldn't be supposed to change my MAC O.o
[10:32] <SilentDis> anyone know of a gui front end for the LAME encoder?  (not one that does CD ripping, just a 'batch converter' of sorts)
[10:32] <loutrine> khaije1, Having some problems applying the patch http://pastebin.com/821750 - I'm relatively new to linux so I'm not sure what to make of this...
[10:33] <rickyfingers_> No, you shouldn't but you also don't know if it's going to be problematic or not
[10:33] <khaije1> k, we can sort it out
[10:33] <khaije1> btw tilda is shweet!
[10:33] <khaije1> !tilda
[10:33] <ubotu> tilda: Linux terminal which behaves like terminals in shooter games. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.09.3-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 32 kB, installed size 148 kB
[10:33] <rickyfingers_> I'm thinking mac address 00000000000000 has a special meaning in the ethernet protocal
[10:33] <rickyfingers_> like a broadcast address or something.
[10:33] <zaynhamdan> yes tilda is sweet but sometimes annoying
[10:33] <khaije1> zaynhamdan: y?
[10:33] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, I guess it's just wrong and the driver is misconfigured
[10:34] <rickyfingers_> so you might run into problems connecting to a wireless network
[10:34] <rickyfingers_> You might want to try ndiswrapping the windows drivers for that card
[10:34] <rickyfingers_> you might have better luck.
[10:34] <zaynhamdan> khaije1: yes, sometimes dialog command requires screen larger than X and Y
[10:34] <rizo> Hi
[10:34] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, hm. yes, maybe it's worth a try
[10:34] <zaynhamdan> hi rizo
[10:34] <rickyfingers_> But it's all just trial and error hacking I'm reccomending, no garuntees.
[10:34] <rizo> I need some help with the grub bootloader in ubunutu breezy
[10:35] <rickyfingers_> If you don't like to hack...
[10:35] <zaynhamdan> rizo: what's your problem?
[10:35] <xarq> rizo: what kind of help?
[10:35] <rizo> i recently created an xfs partition, and resized my root partition
[10:35] <mike1o> how do i add a headphone jack control to alsa?
[10:35] <crimsun> mike1o: you don't.
[10:36] <MakubeX> /j SquirrelMail
[10:36] <rizo> now grib won't boot ubuntu
[10:36] <rizo> grub*
[10:36] <mike1o> crimsun, but I can't use the headphone jack then....
[10:36] <zaynhamdan> rizo: : well when you resize partition, partition order will be changed
[10:36] <rizo> anyway i can reconfigure grub
[10:36] <ademan> can one use checkinstall to keep track of things installed with a *.run (executable) installer?
[10:36] <GhoSt_DoG> Hello
[10:36] <Xteven> hi, what scripts are executed when I log into a terminal in ubuntu ? ~/.bash_profile apparently not
[10:36] <crimsun> mike1o: well, which driver & codec do you have?
[10:36] <GhoSt_DoG> Goof Morning All
[10:36] <GhoSt_DoG> Good*
[10:36] <zaynhamdan> rizo: you must change grub configuration manually, via grub menu
[10:37] <xarq> rizo: that sounds like an "erased files" problem
[10:37] <rizo> yes but idon't know the order
[10:37] <mike1o> crimsun, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.12rc1 (Thu Jun 22 13:55:50 2006 UTC).
[10:37] <khaije1> loutrine: hmm...
[10:37] <zaynhamdan> then when you can boot, you must change /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:37] <crimsun> mike1o: no, driver. cat /proc/asound/modules
[10:37] <rizo> it isn't an erased file as grub does load
[10:37] <xerophyte> with diff when i use --side-by-side i get lines cut off how can i make it full lines ??
[10:37] <loutrine> khaije1, got any ideas :)?
[10:37] <rizo> it just i can't get ubuntu to load from the menu
[10:38] <xarq> rizo: from the grub menu you can type "e" to change the settings until it works, then write that down andput it into your grub file
[10:38] <mike1o> crimsun,  0 snd_intel8x0 1 snd_mpu401s
[10:38] <thor> I am trying to run Midnight Commander in a terminal within gnome, but the -a switch doesn't work. Has anyone figured out a fix or workaround for this problem?
[10:38] <crimsun> mike1o: pastebin your ``lspci -nv''
[10:38] <SilentDis> GhoSt_DoG: greetings and salutations, spectral canine entity :D
[10:39] <khaije1> loutrine: i think it would be easiest to revert that change for now
[10:39] <khaije1> loutrine: i'll post you a link, i gotta dig it up...
[10:39] <mike1o> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30946/
[10:40] <loutrine> khaije1, no changes were made - it couldn't apply the patch
[10:40] <Xteven> nvm found it
[10:40] <Xteven> when an interactive shell is started, .bashrc is executed. .bash_profile is for non-interactive logins
[10:40] <rizo> thanks zaynhamdan
[10:40] <NoWhereMan_> rickyfingers_, ok wiki says rt61 is not supported by ndiswrapper, so it's just a timewaster
[10:41] <NoWhereMan_> i must keep playing with the one I installed :/
[10:41] <zaynhamdan> rizo: you are welcome
[10:41] <crimsun> mike1o: oh right, you have the si7012
[10:41] <mike1o> crimsun, yup :-)
[10:41] <crimsun> mike1o: where's your ``amixer'' output?
[10:42] <ademan> !enemyterritory
[10:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about enemyterritory - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:42] <ademan> !et
[10:42] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[10:42] <youser> anyone know about compiz?
[10:42] <khaije1> loutrine: the thing i wanted to test is if the way the files are tagged causes problems for xine trying to play them
[10:42] <sc4ttrbrain> getting gpg error on apt-get update,NO_PUBKEY 7127E5ABEEF946C8,what should i do?
[10:42] <SilentDis> youser:  sorry, only what ubotu knows for me :(
[10:42] <Flannel> youser: try #ubuntu-xgl or #xgl or #beryl
[10:42] <mike1o> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30947/
[10:42] <youser> ahh thank  you
[10:43] <khaije1> loutrine: it should be possible to just test a file without installing anything
[10:43] <rizo> Here is a screenshot displaying partition on my harddrive in Qtparted. The root partition is ext3. any ideas on what i should use to boot grub to this partition http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/8686/screenshotlv3.png
[10:43] <khaije1> loutrine: by just modifying the file.... i can't think of the best way to do that though
[10:43] <sc4ttrbrain> getting gpg error on apt-get update,NO_PUBKEY 7127E5ABEEF946C8,what should i do?
[10:44] <khaije1> loutrine: i don't have any verifiably bad flac' w/ me....
[10:44] <graeme> guys is there a TUV player for linux ?
[10:44] <xarq> rizo: the volume format shouldn't matter
[10:44] <graeme> one of those tv/bittorrent client thingys ?
[10:45] <rizo> yes but can you tell the order from that
[10:45] <rizo> screenshot
[10:45] <rizo> i know that the disk is hd1
[10:45] <fooadd> graeme, democracy player? or can't a normal torrent client do what you want?
[10:45] <loutrine> khaije1, Oh ok, so I should try removing the tags from a verified non-working flac file and see if it plays?
[10:46] <youser> anyone know how to install metacity themes?
[10:46] <mike1o> crimsun, no hope?
[10:46] <crimsun> mike1o: do you get no audible sound in headphones at all? Are you using Edgy?
[10:46] <crimsun> mike1o: please be patient :)
[10:46] <mike1o> crimsun, no sound at all :-)
[10:46] <xarq> rizo: partitions should follow the order of (hd0,0) (hd0,1), etc.
[10:46] <mike1o> crimsun, i just upgraded to edgy in order to get the newer alsa version
[10:46] <graeme> fooadd: watch tv in real time ? espn, hbo that kinda thing ?
[10:47] <xarq> rizo: additional hard disks would be (hd1,0) etc.
[10:47] <rizo> rite ill have a go
[10:47] <rizo> tahnks for your ehlp
[10:47] <khaije1> loutrine: thats the idea, but i'm not sure if it needs to be done in a particular way, grip is used as an example here (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1634089&forum_id=5443) but i think the fix could apply widely
[10:47] <crimsun> mike1o: not even across speakers?
[10:47] <sc4ttrbrain> getting gpg error on apt-get update,NO_PUBKEY 7127E5ABEEF946C8,what should i do?
[10:47] <graeme> I'm building an older computer for a friend, does anyone have any suggestions for any cool apps that I can put on it ? ... he's a non-computer nerd type ...
[10:47] <tamacracker> Anyone know a GAIM site that has different themes?
[10:47] <mike1o> crimsun, yes i'm listening to La Isla Bonita now!
[10:47] <fooadd> graeme, not sure if it fits, but try democracyplayer
[10:48] <SilentDis> graeme:  how old?
[10:48] <fooadd> tamacracker, gnome-look.org (??)
[10:48] <mike1o> crimsun, the mic worx also
[10:48] <SilentDis> graeme:  the computer, not the friend.  ;)
[10:48] <khaije1> loutrine: (btw, i'm trying to figure out how to do this here for extra verification)
[10:48] <tamacracker> hmm... for gaim? really?
[10:48] <tamacracker> i was just there, ill check it out
[10:48] <mike1o> crimsun, I just wanted to get the headphones working for skype :-)
[10:48] <crimsun> mike1o: kill $(lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*) && sudo modprobe -r $(lsmod |grep ^snd |awk '{print $1}' |sort -r) && sudo rm -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state && sudo modprobe snd-intel8x0
[10:49] <khaije1> loutrine: do you have any email-able (small) bad flacs you could send me to test with?
[10:49] <loutrine> khaije1, I'll try and find a small one... one sec
[10:50] <mike1o> crimsun, sudo?
[10:50] <khaije1> loutrine: cool thanks very much for helping out w/ this!
[10:50] <fooadd> tamacracker, check this out http://kdyne.net/projekty/guifications/index.php?section=about
[10:51] <loutrine> khaije1, no probs - I'd like to find a fix too ;)
[10:51] <graeme> SilentDis: 28 ...
[10:51] <crimsun> mike1o: that's a precise set of commands
[10:51] <SilentDis> graeme:  lol
[10:51] <graeme> where is the radio thingy ?
[10:51] <mike1o> crimsun, OK
[10:51] <graeme> online radio and all that. Also how do i upgrade just to dapper ?
[10:51] <SilentDis> graeme:  a 28 year old computer... and you're giving it away?  hmm... i can think of a couple doors I need propped open... *snicker*
[10:52] <fooadd> heh
[10:52] <mike1o> crimsun, FATAL: Module snd_timer is in use.
[10:52] <crimsun> mike1o: pwd
[10:52] <zaynhamdan> anyone know, what packages that can be used to call via modem wireless?
[10:52] <graeme> SilentDis: oh, no the friend is 28, the computer is P3 with 256MB ...
[10:52] <xarq> 28 years old?  what is it, a PDP-3?
[10:52] <tamacracker> hm... looks like GUIfications are not made for Ubuntu?
[10:52] <mike1o> crimsun, /home/sprok/film
[10:52] <graeme> or maybe 412 or something ... not sure
[10:53] <tamacracker> or Gnome in other words.
[10:53] <crimsun> mike1o: lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*
[10:53] <SilentDis> graeme:  a P3 isn't too horrible... the memory is a bit low though (linux is ram-hungry, in most cases).  what drive size do you have in it?
[10:53] <graeme> SilentDis:40GB
[10:53] <mike1o> crimsun, no output
[10:54] <xarq> graeme: you probably want to run DSL on it
[10:54] <graeme> xarq: ?
[10:54] <crimsun> mike1o: pastebin dmesg. I'm away for 10 minutes.
[10:54] <SilentDis> graeme:  no problems there then (was praying you didn't say 5gb).  and I'd agree with xarq, a lower system intensive distro would probably run better than ubuntu
[10:54] <xarq> graeme: damn-small linux
[10:54] <loutrine> khaije1, well this is strange... the flac file shows as FLAC audio in the 'Type' column in nautilus. However if i select the file, the type changes to MP3 audio in the 'Type' column...
[10:55] <graeme> xarq: I don't think it's that bad. Dapper should run fine methinks ?
[10:55] <loutrine> khaije1, the smallest flac file I have is 22.8MB
[10:55] <SilentDis> graeme:  that box is well-suited to e-mail, browsing, a little MP3 music, basic office work type of thing.
[10:55] <xarq> graeme: depends on how much frustration and performance you feel like putting up with
[10:55] <sc4ttrbrain> getting gpg error on apt-get update,NO_PUBKEY 7127E5ABEEF946C8,what should i do?
[10:55] <cstrippie> graeme - there is always Ubuntu Lite, but it's an early alpha
[10:55] <n0mak> I installed w32 codecs but the *.avi file still won't play. Saying that "You do not have a decoder installed to handle this file. You might need to install the necessary plugins."
[10:55] <mike1o> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30948/
[10:55] <graeme> I have about 386MB of mem ...
[10:55] <khaije1> loutrine: lol, i don't think the email admin here would appreciate that :-)
[10:56] <amee2k> hi all
[10:56] <cstrippie> Planning on playing with it myself in VMware
[10:56] <loutrine> ;)
[10:56] <amee2k> where can i get ubuntu packages for seamonkey?
[10:56] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, google for the error message, I've seen a solution somewhere, but can't remember, it has to do with apt-key or something like that
[10:56] <khaije1> loutrine: ya, there is something weird w/ the tags, we may be on to something
[10:56] <loutrine> khaije1, I can upload it somewhere... megaupload or similar?
[10:56] <khaije1> loutrine: if it works the way it sounds we can try, corp firewall may say otherwise thoguh, do i need to sign up for an account?
[10:57] <loutrine> khaije1, got it compressed down to a 23MB tar.bz2 file
[10:57] <graeme> 386 should be enough to do pretty much about anything.
[10:57] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, do you mean this.. http://www.urlfan.com/local/running_net_applications_on_debian_gnulinux_with_mono/3719399.html
[10:57] <loutrine> khaije1, Nah, you can download for free.
[10:57] <SilentDis> graeme:  the biggest 'problem', if you can call it that, with ubuntu and kubuntu is gnome and kde are VERY memory intensive.  512 is a low level for most of the stuff, 1gb is probably recommended.  I'm doing barely nothing on my box right now and sucking 160mb away.
[10:57] <xarq> graeme: well you have enough hard drive space, but 256 MB of ram and P3 it will run a bit slow
[10:57] <graeme> What's the best way to check what frequency my P3 is running at ?
[10:58] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, yeah
[10:58] <rickyfingers_> grame, depends on the bios
[10:58] <graeme> xarq: yeah, sorry I checked. It's running with 386MB
[10:58] <loutrine> khaije1, is http://megaupload.com accessible from your work network?
[10:58] <n0mak> I installed w32 codecs but the *.avi file still won't play. Saying that "You do not have a decoder installed to handle this file. You might need to install the necessary plugins." What do I have to do now?!
[10:58] <bun-bun> graeme# dmesg
[10:58] <phrizer> i have 384mb memory on a 800mhz system, works fine.
[10:58] <rickyfingers_> some bioses will tell you when you go in, like hitting delete at reboot
[10:58] <SilentDis> graeme:  dropping another 256 stick in there would make it a bit better.  little slow on the 'uptake' as it were, but it would be bareable
[10:58] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, it only returns>> usage: gpg [options]  [filename] 
[10:58] <rickyfingers_> other times, the clock is just set by jumpers on the motherboard
[10:58] <cstrippie> I've run Xubuntu extensively in VMware with 360mb ram; always worked great.
[10:59] <rickyfingers_> and you need to look in the manual to see what jumper setting means what frequency
[10:59] <xarq> graeme: also, you might try a lighter-weight window manager like fluxbox or xubuntu if it feels sluggish
[10:59] <crimsun> mike1o: are you using the latest bios for that machine?
[10:59] <mike1o> crimsun, probably not... how do i update a bios?
[10:59] <SilentDis> graeme:  you can try it, but I'd work your way through the install first, and see how it handles things post-install.  after that, xmms would be a good start.
[11:00] <mike1o> crimsun, i have the 2001 original bios
[11:00] <khaije1> loutrine: it works!
[11:00] <loutrine> khaije1, ok, uploading now :)
[11:00] <khaije1> loutrine: will i actually need flash to use the site though?
[11:00] <graeme> OK, so the P3 is running at 700MHz ..
[11:00] <loutrine> khaije1, good question... I don't believe so... but I can't confirm
[11:00] <graeme> bun-bun: thanks
[11:00] <tamacracker> uh
[11:00] <crimsun> mike1o: your motherboard manufacturer should provide instructions
[11:00] <tamacracker> how do you install guifications?
[11:01] <rickyfingers_> tamacracker, what do you mean guifications,
[11:01] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, it does not a solution imo
[11:01] <mike1o> crimsun, how do i get the motherboard model from the terminal?
[11:01] <graeme> so anyone know how to upgrade to dapper ?
[11:01] <rickyfingers_> like gnome-desktop-environment, or is it some kind of software package
[11:01] <fooadd> tamacracker, I am on my Debian box, apt-cache search shows "gaim-guifications" isn't it apt-gettable in Ubuntu?
[11:01] <tamacracker> rickyfingers_: im lookin to change the theme of my GAIM
[11:01] <rickyfingers_> graeme I think the easiest way to do it
[11:02] <xarq> !upgradetodapper
[11:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about upgradetodapper - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:02] <crimsun> mike1o: you need that info in hard copy.
[11:02] <rickyfingers_> tama -sorry don't use gaim
[11:02] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, this is the right way, but I don't know where can you get ubuntu's public  key ( or whatever  it's called)
[11:02] <SilentDis> !upgrade
[11:02] <tamacracker> alright...
[11:02] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[11:02] <rickyfingers_> graeme, best way is just use a second hd in your box
[11:02] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, what kind of mirrors is in your sources.list, that complains about it?
[11:02] <mike1o> crimsun, lshal | grep K7 worked
[11:03] <khaije1> loutrine: let me know the descriptor when it's available ?
[11:03] <rickyfingers_> I always have two dists on my box
[11:03] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, deb http://debian.meebey.net/pkg-mono/mono/ ./
[11:03] <rickyfingers_> say dist x-1 and dist x
[11:03] <loutrine> khaije1, sure thing - it'll take a few minutes (slow upload speeds here in aus :p)
[11:03] <rickyfingers_> when I upgrade to dist x+1, acually I do a clean install
[11:03] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, its debian mirror,i try to install the latest mono
[11:03] <graeme> I'd be more worried about firefox, from a mem perspective, than I would be about gnome. Although, having said that - I'd be worried about ff from a mem perspective if I had 2GB of mem
[11:03] <rickyfingers_> overwriting dist x-1
[11:03] <rickyfingers_> then copy essesntial stuff over from dist x
[11:04] <rickyfingers_> ubuntu installer is good about automatically configuring grub to still enable me to boot dist x
[11:04] <khaije1> loutrine: oic, btw i'll need o hop off in a little less than an hour. if this isnt done by then i'll be on the same time tomorrow
[11:04] <rickyfingers_> in case something's really broken in x+1
[11:04] <SilentDis> graeme:  i've eaten 2gb ram before, just doing webdev stuff.  thank god linux is nice about giving it back as you close stuff... unlike a certain *OTHER* operating system, which I won't mention :P
[11:05] <xarq> oo, khali is a sweet theme for gnome
[11:05] <mike1o> crimsun, i found this http://www.ocworkbench.com/2002/ecs/k7s5abios/cheepobios.htm  for my K7S5A mb
[11:05] <loutrine> khaije1, yup, sure thing
[11:05] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, there is a gpg file here  http://debian.meebey.net/Release.gpg, and maybe this will help you  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/174
[11:06] <graeme> what's the story with the root password on ubuntu ? I never set any ...
[11:06] <xarq> graeme: you can set it later if you wish
[11:06] <graeme> xarq: it's empty ?
[11:07] <xarq> graeme: no, it's off
[11:07] <graeme> xarq: even in breezy ?
[11:07] <n0mak> I have Mplayer & all the players from add/remove applications->sound&video . I installed win32 codecs but Mplayer still wont play *avi. Any guidance please?!
[11:07] <xarq> graeme: in all versions
[11:07] <variant> graeme: it is a random string, its not "off"
[11:07] <SilentDis> graeme:  no root, normally.  you can sudo to root from your primary user account, should you need it
[11:08] <fooadd> n0mak, other players give the same problem?
[11:08] <graeme> SilentDis: yeah, but sudo isn't going to work for everything right ?
[11:08] <variant> graeme: yes, it works for everything
[11:08] <SilentDis> graeme:  if you need an interactive root terminal, type sudo -i :)
[11:08] <xarq> graeme: sudo -s usually does
[11:08] <n0mak> hmm, I've only used mplayer, sec.
[11:08] <Crazysk8|Server_> oi
[11:08] <variant> graeme: if you new the password you could do su and then enter the random string.. :)
[11:08] <Mavez-San> j00buntu
[11:08] <graeme> where did that internet radio thingy go ? ... I thought that came on a vanilla breezy install ?
[11:09] <Flannel> graeme: sudo does work for everything, except some inflexibly written 3rd party scripts, but 99% of the time people don't see those.
[11:09] <Flannel> variant: it's not a random string.  It is off.
[11:09] <tamacracker> found it... thanks alot for the GUIfication for GAIM :D
[11:10] <variant> Flannel: there has to be a root password
[11:10] <graeme> Flannel: it doesn't work for everything on RedHat ...
[11:10] <Flannel> variant: no there doesnt
[11:10] <variant> Flannel: please explain
[11:10] <Flannel> graeme: right, redhat is not designed for use of sudo
[11:10] <Flannel> graeme: Ubuntu is designed to use sudo in everything
[11:10] <Flannel> variant: the root password's hash is set to a value that will never be produced with the hash alg.

[11:11] <variant> Flannel: so there is one, just not one that can be guessed
[11:11] <graeme> Flannel: well if sudo can do everything root can do ... then what's the point in having sudo at all ?
[11:11] <Flannel> variant: it's equivalent of .. locking the account (with normal -l)
[11:11] <SilentDis> ubotu, you're my hero :)
[11:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about you're my hero :) - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:11] <Flannel> variant: no password can ever match it.  Even if someone tried every single combination.
[11:11] <xarq> graeme: the point is it's safer to only elevate privileges when you nede to
[11:11] <variant> graeme: it is a conveneice
[11:11] <variant> graeme: convenience
[11:11] <Flannel> !sudo  | graeme, this page explains the benefits
[11:11] <ubotu> graeme, this page explains the benefits: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[11:12] <graeme> variant: it's more convenient to just go to root IMO ...
[11:12] <Flannel> graeme: logging, more fine grained rights, etc.
[11:12] <Flannel> graeme: read that page, it explains it all
[11:12] <xarq> variant: no, it's convenient to run as root
[11:12] <variant> graeme: there are reasons not to use it as well, i agree, it most cases it it easyer to have a root shell. some (rightly) consider this to be dangerous. especially for new users
[11:12] <variant> xarq: it is a convenience for new users
[11:13] <graeme> yeah, I've read the theory behind it, but I still think that unless it shields the user from doing something nasty, like on RH. Then there isn't much point to it ... But then I could be mistaken of course ...
[11:13] <variant> graeme: i agree
[11:13] <variant> graeme: mostly
[11:13] <Flannel> graeme: It keeps people from kepeing a root prompt open all the time, and as such, reduces the risk of accidentally doing something one shouldnt be doing
[11:14] <variant> graeme: in some ways it is insecure, remote shell giving exploits only have to work on a user account to get full root privs
[11:14] <n0mak> fooadd, none of the programs play's it. I tried Noatun, Kino and Kaffeine. Noatun didn't give any errors it just did not show the picture and there was no sound.
[11:14] <SilentDis> graeme:  on most installs I do for others, I create a new user account for them right away without access to sudo.  they have to purposly log in as their 'super user' account in order to mess things up.  gives them pause before they do it ;)

[11:16] <fooadd> n0mak, weird, just this avi file? how about apt-get --reinstall install w32codes?
[11:16] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, have you read the debian-administration howto?
[11:16] <khaije1> loutrine: cool
[11:17] <n0mak> fooadd, well I only have this one in my computer right now. I just installed linux on and I've never used it before, thought I should mention it. Anyway. I should reinstall w32 codecs?
[11:18] <fooadd> n0mak, give it a try
[11:18] <n0mak> k
[11:19] <fooadd> n0mak, if it's the same, try downloading some avi file and test $your_player again ;)
[11:20] <n0mak> fooadd, I don't think the problem's in the avi file. I've watched this movie thousands of times before and worked fine on win xp.
[11:21] <fooadd> n0mak, I would reinstall mplayer too, or even install vlc or xine and try them, that's what I would do :)
[11:21] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, tried twice, but it does not exist

[11:25] <loutrine> khaije1, sorry :S?
[11:25] <SilentDis> brb...
[11:26] <Genrl_Zod> I saw a video tutorial on google on how to install Ubuntu via a dos equivalent environement. I knew what i wanted to do as i was going to creeate 2 partitions on my C: one for the bill gates suite and one for the ubuntu. So i rebooted and had my CD in there. Instead of getting a dosish env, i was booted directly into the GUI. So now im kinda stuffed
[11:26] <blackwire83> (btw my wlan card is intel2100)
[11:26] <fooadd> sc4ttrbrain, just curious, does that message halts the installation of the mono packages? if not, just ignore that bastard apt :P
[11:26] <khaije1> loutrine: i'm gonna try this fix... also saw this http://flac.sourceforge.net/faq.html#general__tagging which seems related
[11:26] <Genrl_Zod> Is there liek a vid tutotrial that may be able to help me instaling ubuntu on my secondary partition of my HDD.
[11:26] <hume> i'm trying an upgrade from dapper to edgy on a laptop, but the update-manager crashes. is it as safe to just exchange "dapper" for "edgy" in the sources and run apt-get dist-upgrade?

[11:27] <fooadd> hmmm
[11:27] <Feldegast> hume you can do that

[11:30] <loutrine> khaije1, I noticed in the first thread you linked me to (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=210683&page=10) someone mentioned libxine1 1.1.2 fixed the problem. However I'm running  1.1.2+repacked1-0ubuntu and I've still got the problem..

[11:32] <khaije1> loutrine: its a fairly new problem afaik
[11:32] <loutrine> khaije1, I've got to head out unfortunately. If you're on tomorrow I'll let you know if i get anywhere with it :)
[11:32] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  when you're booted from the live CD, there should be an irc client you can bring up and talk with us from there.  from what i remember, you don't have to worry about ANYTHING till it hits the 'choose partition'
[11:32] <fooadd> n0mak, copy and paste the output of that command
[11:32] <sc4ttrbrain> fooadd, any other way ?

[11:33] <fooadd> Genrl_Zod, use xchat , mirc sucks :P
[11:33] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod: and if you've already got your drive partitioned (the windows partition, and some blank space at the end, as example)  usually, ubuntu will automatically choose that blank space to install to.
[11:33] <n0mak> fooadd, to where I should type it, into terminal?
[11:33] <hume> Genrl_Zod, yes, with wine, but why not use xchat instead?
[11:33] <MattJ> !terminal | n0mak

[11:52] <livingdaylight> ajax4, I am in Ubuntu, what i said is that in Kubuntu (kde) it is very simple with the language/option dialog in the taskbar, but in Ubuntu (gnome) of course it is not so configurable
[11:52] <Zyclop> if i wanted to execute a command as root at boot, what should i do?
[11:52] <fyrestrtr> fabiim: install build-essential and try it again.
[11:52] <basilf> try the Epson 3800 works great for me
[11:53] <fabiim> fyrestrtr:  i have that already
[11:53] <aduarte> fooadd: Yes, (but these are not located on lost+found or .Trash)
[11:53] <livingdaylight> EVERYBODY ! DOES GNOME SUCK WHEN IT COMES TO CONFIGURABILITY?
[11:53] <rizo> Hello I nees some helo with my linux swap partition
[11:53] <MattJ> Zyclop: I use cron
[11:53] <fabiim> fyrestrtr:  but i can always try to install it again , do you think is worthy ?
[11:53] <fyrestrtr> Zyclop: add it to /etc/init.d/rc.local
[11:53] <aduarte> fooadd: There is something wrong, even from terminal I do not recover my HD space
[11:53] <MattJ> Zyclop: sudo crontab -e
[11:53] <ajax4> livingdaylight: Have you tried the Gnome Character Palette?
[11:53] <fyrestrtr> fabiim: no, you would have to read the docs.
[11:54] <MattJ> Add a line to the file, starting with @reboot
[11:54] <Zyclop> fyrestrtr: if i screw up, would i still be able to boot?
[11:54] <fooadd> aduarte, is there a specific partition that you are having a problem with? or is it your root partition?
[11:54] <fabiim> but the thing is , I have the libc.so.6 , I check it out
[11:54] <livingdaylight> ajax4, no, but what is the point of having a keyboard layout if it doens't work?
[11:54] <Mantice> I love Wanda the Fish.
[11:54] <MattJ> Zyclop: Then the command you want to run, on the same line, after it
[11:54] <fyrestrtr> Zyclop: yes.
[11:54] <rizo> NO GNOME DOES NOT SUCK
[11:54] <fooadd> n0mak,  I know, that's why I suggested installing gstreamer-misc
[11:54] <livingdaylight> ajax4, where is this gnome character pallete?
[11:54] <aduarte> fooadd: Actually is a extra HD
[11:54] <fabiim> fyrestrtr: yeah ... but i don't have the doc's , i get it out of emule and it's only the bin
[11:54] <basilf> Is there a way to switch to KDE from Ubuntu Gnome and back again?
[11:54] <aduarte> fooadd: But the problem seems to be only on it.
[11:55] <fyrestrtr> fabiim: google it :)
[11:55] <fabiim> oh! i guess i can find the documentation on the net ,
[11:55] <fabiim> fyrestrtr:  lol yeah :) thanks
[11:55] <ademan> !et
[11:55] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[11:55] <fyrestrtr> basilf: install kde-desktop, then use the login manage and choose the gnome session.
[11:55] <Zyclop> fyrestrtr: ok, i'll try that out. thanks.
[11:55] <ajax4> livingdaylight: Right click any gnome panel and add the applet. Try "Character Pallete" and try "Keyboard Indictator"
[11:55] <basilf> How? What is the procedure
[11:55] <motoplux> hello
[11:55] <fooadd> aduarte, those partition are fat ? nautilus makes a hidden directory sometimes, and moves the deleted files to it
[11:55] <wombo> Could someone here please help me with setting up a LVM? im having trouble reinstalled twice already
[11:56] <ajax4> livingdaylight: I think you might be able to change Keyboard Layout with the "Keyboard Indicator" applet, though only speaking one language I've never used it. :)
[11:56] <livingdaylight> ajax4, gnome panel?
[11:57] <motoplux> can someone help me with gnome/nautilus. I need to know how to modify  the open with menu and if exist a config file... something like that
[11:57] <aduarte> fooadd: No, its a ext3, and the files are not hidden, since I already look for those, I even delete those by Shift+Del or "rm file.ext" but the problem is the same
[11:57] <fooadd> livingdaylight, yeah , right click it, add to panel -> keyboard indicator , that's what I did yesterday for Greek ;)
[11:58] <livingdaylight> ajax4,  r me her , ja
[11:58] <ajax4> livingdaylight: It worked?
[11:58] <fooadd> aduarte, , df -h , delete some files, df -h again, no space regained?
[11:58] <livingdaylight> ajax4, 
[11:58] <Mantice> Any one installed CD emu ? http://cdemu.sourceforge.net/
[11:58] <ajax4> livingdaylight: Good deal. See it was there all along, just need to know how to find it :)
[11:58] <livingdaylight> ajax4, that was exactly what i was looking for
[11:59] <aduarte> fooadd: No, I already try that
[11:59] <ajax4> livingdaylight: Glad to help
[11:59] <fooadd> aduarte, weird....
[11:59] <aduarte> fooadd: Yes, I even fsck.ext3 that partition, and the same
[12:00] <livingdaylight> ajax4, yea... i got frustrated because i went to system/preference and changed keyboard layout from there and it wasn't working. And how was i supposed to know about adding to the panel? so... but that is why people like you in the community on irc make ubuntu what it is
[12:00] <fooadd> aduarte, really weird... where does the freaking space go?!? :P
[12:00] <CoffeeBreaks> I am searching for guidance on how to add new graphic driver support to Xorg in a stable manner (i.e. I don't want it to break if there are updates from ubuntu). I have a Dell optiplex 745 with an Intel GMA 3000, and intel released the drivers as OSS. Someone knows how to do that ?
[12:01] <livingdaylight> ajax4, even The Official Ubuntu Book didn't tell me i should add "keyboard" indicator to panel
[12:01] <fooadd> livingdaylight,  how do you read this  "" in Deutsch ?:P
[12:01] <aduarte> fooadd: I know, is hard to think that the file system is damaged, since I just create it 2 days ago
[12:02] <livingdaylight> fooadd, i was just demonstrating to ajax4 how it was working. Now i have all the special german letters i was looking for working :D
[12:02] <fooadd> livingdaylight,  ich weiss das, just kidding you ;)
[12:02] <basilf> Thanks for the help
[12:02] <Lattyware> Can anyone help me get my audio working?
[12:02] <livingdaylight> fooadd, hehe... Viel Spa!
[12:03] <scamot> argh help with gnucash, I cannot read my files anymore since fresh install of dapper after having removed breezy
[12:03] <therealbigusdick> which is the official ubuntu book?
[12:03] <motoplux> Does anybody know how to remove an item from the "open with" nautilus' menu??
[12:03] <ermak> can anyone tell how to run eclipse in edgy?
[12:03] <scamot> gnucash in the dapper repos cannot read my .xml file
[12:03] <livingdaylight> therealbigusdick, The Official Ubuntu Book is the official ubuntu book - There can be only ONE! :D
[12:03] <snowshoefox> how do i train kdevelop?
[12:04] <Mantice> fooadd, could we install mdf to iso ? its worth a try if we cant get this cd emu to work
[12:04] <fooadd> Mantice, yeah, then mount them ;)
[12:04] <Mantice> fooadd, Whats the first step :)
[12:04] <scamot> tried to install gnucash2 from tar.bz unsuccessfully

[12:05] <therealbigusdick> mako hill cool... hopefully they wrote in that book how to fix gnome-terminal fonts in edgy :)
[12:05] <fooadd> Mantice, install http://mdf2iso.berlios.de/ , then "sudo mount -o loop foo1.iso /mnt/iso
[12:05] <fooadd> Mantice, just that simple ;)
[12:05] <xarq> LoL is Lisp on Lines
[12:05] <mike1o> crimsun, I just discovered my MB doesn't have any headphone jack !
[12:05] <livingdaylight> therealbigusdick, nah...its all Dapper ;)
[12:05] <Mantice> fooadd, Wheres the download ?
[12:06] <xarq> !LoL is Lisp on Lines, similar to Ruby on Rails but in a Lispy way
[12:06] <ermak> !eclipse
[12:06] <livingdaylight> therealbigusdick, but i got it just to support Ubuntu like...
[12:06] <ubotu> eclipse: Extensible Tool Platform and Java IDE. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.2.1-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 121 kB, installed size 412 kB
[12:06] <fooadd> Mantice,  https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2545
[12:06] <Mantice> fooadd, found it.
[12:06] <livingdaylight> therealbigusdick, not that Mark Shuttleworth needs financial support... :)
[12:06] <fooadd> Mantice,  there is a .deb file too, spoil yourself ;)
[12:06] <therealbigusdick> forget about the eclipse packages in edgy they are so full of crap. Use the official bundle from the eclipse site and be done with it
[12:07] <Mantice> fooadd, I love deb files.
[12:08] <Mantice> fooadd, ok done that.
[12:08] <Mantice> fooadd, How do I convert ?
[12:09] <fooadd> Mantice, md2iso --help, does it come with  a manpage? anyway, I'll install it wait...
[12:10] <eXistenZ> won't gnome ever change that nautilus?
[12:10] <eXistenZ> It is not the best file browser
[12:10] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ, what's wrong with nautilus
[12:10] <fabiim> where should i install a program according to ubuntu's policy?
[12:10] <fabiim> ./usr/share/bin ?
[12:10] <fooadd> fabiim, install it where you want, how about /usr/local ?
[12:10] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, sometimes it makes my cpu consumption %100, and I have to kill it, to get things back
[12:11] <ajax4> Still having problems with no sound. Mute is off, card is detected by lspci, module is detected by lsmod...any suggestions?
[12:11] <fabiim> fooadd: : thanks
[12:11] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ,that sucks
[12:11] <eXistenZ> yeah
[12:11] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ, I think it is the best gnome has to offer though
[12:11] <eXistenZ> I'm not sure why I find KDE applications faster
[12:11] <eXistenZ> like KchmViewer is better than gnome's chm viewer
[12:12] <eXistenZ> It just runs faster
[12:12] <fooadd> eXistenZ,  I had a problem with cpu usage too, only when opening a directory with .gif (animated files, and the preview option is on) nautilus hangs :/
[12:12] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ, xfce4 file manager is pretty cool and very fast
[12:12] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ, many "official" components of gnome are crap (e.g. impossible to configure metacity, and yes nautilus which is a memory hog)
[12:12] <valehru_23> hey guys, I need to change the password on my vncserver via ssh...any clues?
[12:13] <motoplux> Does someone know how to remove an item from the "open with" menu in nautilus??
[12:13] <therealbigusdick> that's why I use xfwm4 as window manager in gnome
[12:13] <fooadd> motoplux, right click the file >-- properties -> open with -> add/remove (??)
[12:14] <ifireball> motoplux: right-click->properties->open with->remove
[12:14] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, xfwm4 is good?
[12:15] <therealbigusdick> is the best window manager I know. sawfish is just to old for current gnome. metacity is unusable (and is in gnome only because the author is friend of gnome founder)...
[12:15] <therealbigusdick> so xfwm4 is a good choice at least for me
[12:15] <therealbigusdick> you can still use gnome as desktop
[12:15] <ifireball> eXistenZ: I lacks alot of features, and the UI is not all that, thunar is better IMHO on the lightweight category
[12:15] <Mantice> fooadd, I got it to work
[12:15] <fooadd> Mantice,  good :)
[12:16] <xarq> don't forget ratpoison, fluxbox, and 100 other window managers
[12:16] <Mantice> fooadd, I think I am starting to use the terminal more :)
[12:16] <eXistenZ> ifireball, do you use thunar?
[12:16] <motoplux> the button remove is disabled
[12:16] <fooadd> Mantice,  :)
[12:16] <therealbigusdick> I am looking for the package which contains the xfce file manager...
[12:16] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, How can I replace both window managers?
[12:17] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, I installed xfwm4
[12:17] <ifireball> eXistenZ: I used to, now I got a machine powerful enough for Nautilus, whic I think no mattar what you say, is the best feature-eise
[12:17] <eXistenZ> ifireball, what are the specs of your machine?
[12:17] <motoplux> fooadd, the button remove is disable
[12:17] <eXistenZ> ifireball, mem/cpu
[12:17] <ifireball> eXistenZ: dual AMD64 + 2G ram
[12:17] <Abst> Is there a way to install a linux ISO (to the HDD) without a cd?
[12:17] <motoplux> ifireball, the button remove is disable
[12:17] <therealbigusdick> eXistenZ, is pretty easy you need to go to the session System->Preferences->Sessions->Current Session
[12:17] <Abst> If I am already on Linux
[12:17] <therealbigusdick> and then remove crap metacity from the list
[12:18] <eXistenZ> ifireball, 2GB is a blast :)
[12:18] <therealbigusdick> at this point your windows will look weird because the wm is gone
[12:18] <ifireball> motoplux: select the option you want to remove 1st
[12:18] <sioux> hi ubuntus why apt-get install build essential says impossible find...
[12:18] <eXistenZ> ifireball, I have 3Ghz P4 512MB
[12:18] <eXistenZ> I should get another 512MB
[12:18] <ifireball> eXistenZ: well, I VMware a lot I need it
[12:18] <xarq> !repos
[12:18] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[12:18] <therealbigusdick> then in a terminal you start xfw4
[12:18] <motoplux> ifireball, I selected but the button remove is disabled
[12:18] <roryy> sioux: try 'build-essential', not 'build essential'
[12:18] <fooadd> motoplux,  no idea then... have you used "nautilus-actions", not sure if it solves your problem though ..
[12:18] <therealbigusdick> next time you exit gnome the session will be saved and you will have xfwm4 per default
[12:18] <Mantice> fooadd, Your command dident work.
[12:18] <Gasten> sioux: Becuase there isn't any package named build or essential.
[12:18] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, What is metacity?
[12:19] <fooadd> Mantice, which command?
[12:19] <MicrosoftSpy> I've just bought a new PC however it has an IDE CDROM and a SATA HDD but it won't boot ubuntu from the CD....Anyone had similar probs from booting IDE ?
[12:19] <ifireball> eXistenZ: actually 512 should be enough, gnome takes up 196M on my machine
[12:19] <Mantice> fooadd, sudo mount -o loop Warcraft\ III.iso /mnt/iso
[12:19] <fooadd> Mantice,  does the directort /mnt/iso exist?
[12:19] <therealbigusdick> uh? I thought you wanted to replace metacity with xfwm4
[12:19] <sioux> rory thank you it is as y said! :-)
[12:19] <fooadd> directory*
[12:19] <motoplux> fooadd: ok tnx, I will try... I also tried to search for a config file, but no lucky
[12:19] <Mantice> fooadd, no thats why it dont work :(
[12:19] <therealbigusdick> which wm are you using now?
[12:19] <ifireball> motoplux: seems you can't remove the default option...
[12:19] <snowshoefox> quick question... if i'm going to resize my partition for a laptop install with an existing XP with 5 gigs free, how come the repartitioner is alotting 65GB?
[12:20] <Mantice> fooadd, so I got rid of the /iso and it did somthing but im not sure.
[12:20] <fooadd> Mantice,  sudo mkdir /mnt/iso , or use and directory you have on your hard drive :)
[12:20] <Mantice> fooadd, how do I unmount ?
[12:20] <motoplux> ifireball, there are item added buy some program that are no longer installed. I tried also to run nautilus by root, but still remove button disabled
[12:21] <eXistenZ> therealbigusdick, Do i have to remove metacity and nautilus or only metacity?
[12:21] <fooadd> Mantice,  sudo umount -lf /where/you/mounted/the/first/time ;)
[12:21] <MicrosoftSpy> I've just bought a new PC however it has an IDE CDROM and a SATA HDD but it won't boot ubuntu from the CD....Anyone had similar probs from booting IDE ?
[12:21] <ademan> huh... i installed an update and now nautilus won't start
[12:21] <snowshoefox> is there a feature for installing ubuntu with an existing OS installation?
[12:21] <tamacracker> Can anyone tell me where i can find my GIMP 2.2 Folder?
[12:22] <tamacracker> Not even the search is finding it :(
[12:22] <Mantice> fooadd, all my mounts are gone :( :(
[12:22] <therealbigusdick> well I am not sure if you want to get rid of metacity, what's exactly what you need to replace? You can remove metacity with the instruction I gave you. but to replace nautilus you need the xfce4 file manager (I am not sure in which package is this file manager)
[12:22] <xarq> tamacracker: try locate gimp
[12:22] <ifireball> tamacracker: its probably hidden im your home dir (its name begins with a dot) use "ls -a" on the command line
[12:22] <tamacracker> in terminal?
[12:22] <fooadd> motoplux,  I wonder if such options could be configured via gconf-editor, but me thinks gnome is not that good at customizing everything like KDE...
[12:22] <roryy> tamacracker: do you mean '$HOME/.gimp-2.2' ?
[12:22] <therealbigusdick> gconf-editor->crap
[12:22] <fooadd> Mantice, huh? what did you type?
[12:23] <tamacracker> i just need to access the plug in folder lol
[12:23] <Gasten> tamacracker: I think it is in /usr/lib/gimp/2.2/ or something. tro locate gimp/2.2
[12:23] <fooadd> therealbigusdick, true
[12:23] <therealbigusdick> suppose I have two machines and I want to transfer my gconf settings from one machine to another
[12:23] <jesper> I'm having problems with formating/burning a DVD-RW using dvd+rw-tools... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30955/plain/. Can anyone help?
[12:23] <therealbigusdick> gconf design makes this task almost impossible (or at least a huge PITA to deal with)
[12:24] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: easy, you just copy your ~/.gconf directory
[12:24] <therealbigusdick> ifireball, it does't work
[12:24] <therealbigusdick> doesn't
[12:24] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: any idea why?
[12:24] <xarq> mmm... pitas, you're making me hungry
[12:24] <therealbigusdick> try it it really doesn't work
[12:24] <Mantice> fooadd, dont worry I just used that commmand on the mnt folder.
[12:25] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: I got it working on roaming NFS home folders, I cantr see how copying would be any different
[12:25] <therealbigusdick> gconf has these gconf-merge-tree utilities, etc. all tools to deal with that mess
[12:26] <tamacracker> oh lol all i had to do was click view, and check view hidden files
[12:26] <tamacracker> wooot
[12:26] <CyberSlug> I am having immense difficulties getting hardware sensors working in Edgy (they worked fine in Dapper). I have installed lm-sensors, but they seem simple not to work. Any ideas?
[12:26] <tamacracker> im startin to love linux more than windows by the hours.
[12:26] <grodius> Hey is Flash 9 Available now that Edy is out?
[12:26] <_azrael> grodius: I know you can get Flash 9 from the Seveas repos.
[12:27] <therealbigusdick> ifireball, here a quote from a gnome developer for you:
[12:27] <therealbigusdick> "GConf, with its support for mandatory settings and system defaults, was supposed to be a big improvement for system administrators, but it ended up being something of a boondogle because the features were hard for sysadmins to use. In most cases it actually made things harder as sysadmins struggled through the giant XML files for defaults"
[12:27] <therealbigusdick> is crap, and gnome developers know it
[12:27] <fooadd> therealbigusdick, why I am not surprised :P
[12:27] <therealbigusdick> hopefully it will be replaced, some day
[12:27] <eXistenZ> what shortcut takes the cursor to the first of the sentence in the terminal?
[12:27] <xarq> nah, big xml files are always fun
[12:27] <eXistenZ> s/first/beginning
[12:27] <Rug> Howdy all
[12:28] <fooadd> eXistenZ, Ctrl+E (??)
[12:28] <grodius> _azrael, how would I access said repos
[12:28] <Kim^J> Hmm... Bluefish in Edgy seems REALLY stable. Dies everytime I try to save a file. :|
[12:28] <therealbigusdick> xarq, they aren't XML is inteded to be parsed by machines, not by humans
[12:28] <motoplux> fooadd, thank you for the hint, but seems there isn't a list of application to open file with... or maybe I didn't find it :P
[12:28] <fooadd> Ctrl+A **
[12:28] <CyberSlug> Any ideas?
[12:28] <eXistenZ> fooadd, ah, thanks :)
[12:28] <grodius> _azrael, is there a risk in using an outside repository?
[12:28] <therealbigusdick> and "machines" in this case are the gconf-* tools which are crap
[12:28] <xarq> therealbigusdick: like I said, that's some fun going on there
[12:28] <fooadd> eXistenZ, you're welcome :)
[12:28] <therealbigusdick> so the sysadmin needs to parse and understand the mess
[12:29] <fooadd> motoplux,  I remember googling for something like, but I gave up .... I'll live with GNOME the way it is :P
[12:29] <_azrael> grodius: Yes, there is some risk. Seveas is an ubuntu dev so far as I know, but his repos are explicitly _NOT_ ubuntu main repos--they are unstable.
[12:29] <_azrael> grodius: I just know it's there because I use these repos on a regular basis--they're usualloy fine.
[12:29] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: you don't seem to like gnome very much... also since its XML you have tons of tools you can use other then the gconf-* tools, also its quite well ordered into diectories, etc. not so hard to understand imho
[12:29] <_azrael> grodius: Alternatively, just get it straight from macromedia and follow their instructions.

[12:30] <michael__> hey guys
[12:30] <motoplux> fooadd, I googled too, but he wasn't my best friend this time ;)
[12:30] <therealbigusdick> ifireball, I use gnome as my daily desktop. I don't like ALL OF IT. I think some of its components are the biggest crap (e.g. metacity).
[12:30] <xarq> therealbigusdick: I don't get it, why would a sysadmin bother reading a large gnome xml file?  he wouldn't
[12:30] <michael__> Hey, has anyone here gotten WoW to work on Edgy? I have wine 0.9.24
[12:31] <fooadd> motoplux,  and will never be , if you keep googling for such stuff :P, GOD! in KDE you can almost change EVERYTHING
[12:31] <therealbigusdick> xarq, think about a corporate network using gnome as desktop on all computers which should use similar gconf settings
[12:31] <ailean> guys, does anyone have an idea of what market share desktop linux has at the moment?  i know it's impossible to tell exactly . . .
[12:31] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: every time you say the work "crap" you lose respect points with me, say what you don't like, don't use generic words, do remeber that every piece here is someone's hard work

[12:31] <tamacracker> What makes WINE Bluefish any better than normal Wine?
[12:31] <_azrael> michael__: Even though you're using edgy, I'd reccomend going to the wine channel for support on that one.
[12:32] <michael__> yeah where's that?
[12:32] <CyberSlug> Got it
[12:32] <CyberSlug> Thanks guyes
[12:32] <highvoltage> hi. what's the package called that is installed on the ubuntu install cd that provides the rescue environmen?
[12:32] <therealbigusdick> ifireball, I already stated what I don't like, it is just my opinion. And hard work is no excuse for bad quality.
[12:32] <highvoltage> (if I want to install it on a custom cd, for example)
[12:32] <_azrael> #winehq, I'm trying to remember which network
=== Crazysk8|Server is now known as Crazysk8|Eten
[12:33] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: its the fine line between cosntructive and destructive (read: stupid) criticisem
[12:33] <_azrael> michael__: It is in fact this network. Just type "/join #winehq" (without quotes) to get to them.
[12:33] <xarq> therealbigusdick: that's odd, my gconf files are all about 3-9 lines long
[12:33] <stormy_> Hi ppl. I've installed vmware on edgy and I'm trying to use a webcam in a virtual machine. Edgy very helpfully loads the drivers as soon as I plug the cam in and I'm guessing that is what is stopping vmware from being able to grab the cam... any way of stopping edgy from autoloading the drivers?
[12:34] <Rug> I have some problems running EnemyTerritory.  I am running Twinview with 2 screens at a total resolution of 2560x1024 (1280x1024 each), My metamodes are correctly setup in xorg.conf.  When I launch the game and set it for 1280x1024 (which should give me full-screen on screen #1) it shows 75% on screen #1 and 25% on screen #2.  I have run other games at "full screen 1280x1024" without any problems.  Any advice?
[12:35] <xarq> therealbigusdick: there are tons of window managers to choose from, sysadmins don't *have* to choose gnome, and they certainly don't have to set it up differently from the default
[12:35] <ifireball> xarq: hes just being off the mark, I've had the plesure of using gnome in sich a scenarion for a while, its took some work, but it was the same kind of work requiered to integrate any kind of unix desktop
[12:35] <tamacracker> muahahaha i hope i can get eyecandy 4000 to work with gimp on linux now :D
[12:35] <xarq> tamacracker: eyecandy is a photoshop plugin?
[12:36] <tamacracker> yep
[12:36] <tamacracker> Eye Candy 4000
[12:36] <xarq> tamacracker: are you reading a howto on making it work?
[12:36] <tamacracker> Yep :D
[12:36] <xarq> tamacracker: can you paste the url?

[12:37] <tamacracker> woot
[12:37] <tamacracker> if this works.
[12:37] <tamacracker> seriously
[12:37] <tamacracker> ill never see windows ever again.
[12:37] <tamacracker> EVER.
[12:37] <tamacracker> Wait... well there is video games :D
[12:37] <MenZaLap> gimp can never beat Photoshop with me :<
[12:38] <Gasten> No?
[12:38] <MenZaLap> No.
[12:38] <tamacracker> All I need is Eye Candy and I'll be satisfied :)
[12:38] <MenZaLap> Hmm, is Xfce _much_ nicer on the CPU than Gnome?
[12:38] <xarq> tamacracker: thanks!  xD
[12:38] <Rug> MenZaLap: Very
[12:38] <therealbigusdick> MenZaLap, yes
[12:38] <tamacracker> np :)
[12:38] <fooadd> tamacracker, have you tested this on Linux ?
[12:38] <Gasten> MenZaLap: No. just on memory.
[12:38] <MenZaLap> *shrugs*
[12:38] <MenZaLap> I'll go Xfce then
[12:38] <tamacracker> Not yet, I gotta find my Plug In CDs
[12:38] <ifireball> MenZaLap: not that much in my experiance, I had managed to get the xfpanel to hog the CPU in the past
[12:39] <tamacracker> if it works, I'll make sure to spread the word and post it up on ubuntu's forum
[12:39] <jordan_> hello
[12:39] <fooadd> tamacracker, yeah please do :D
[12:39] <therealbigusdick> ifireball, and you reported that bug to malone?
[12:39] <ifireball> MenZaLap: it may be easyer on the ram though, but that totally depends on the panel componnents you use
[12:39] <xarq> I don't see what the fuss about using xml for configuring is about. xml is the standard - just look at OS X's plist XML format, and Vista's xml formats
[12:39] <MenZaLap> I hate having my music skip and lag
[12:40] <tamacracker> I never heard of Xfce
[12:40] <tamacracker> is that similar to gimp/PS?
[12:40] <MenZaLap> I hated Xfce the last two times I used it
[12:40] <MenZaLap> Xfce is a Window Manager
[12:40] <highvoltage> i love ubuntu

[12:40] <destruction> who's able to help a real nooob :p
[12:41] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: I didn't feel like analysing it at the time, it had to do with killink X violently and causig 2 panel processes to run at the same time, hardly a common case, but the panel menu is HEAVY
[12:41] <MenZaLap> destruction: depends what it's about:)
[12:41] <tamacracker> ok brb
[12:41] <destruction> hehe, just installed ubuntu
[12:41] <sa0> why gtk-switch-theme don't modify ugly fonts of firefox ?

[12:42] <stoned> ubuntu sucks
[12:42] <MenZaLap> destruction: I'm pretty sure 2.0 is in the repositories, let me check

[12:43] <therealbigusdick> a gnome panel:

[12:43] <sa0> hi fooadd
[12:44] <MenZaLap> sa0: oh?
[12:44] <MenZaLap> What's the problem with Firefox?
[12:44] <sa0> ugly big fonts and gui
[12:44] <MenZaLap> CTRL + scroll back, and get a new theme.
[12:44] <MenZaLap> Simple as that.
[12:44] <MenZaLap> http://addons.mozilla.org
[12:44] <sa0> don't think
[12:44] <netG> Why fluxbox? Try XFCE!!! It's great if you whant speed
[12:44] <sa0> i tried but no results
[12:44] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: I'm not comparing gnoem and XFCE here, I know gnome is heavyer, but back when I had I 128M machine, XFCE was heavy on it as well, its not the be all end all solution to everything
[12:45] <MenZaLap> I think there's even a theme that fits the Human theme, sa0
[12:45] <netG> and it's GTK
[12:45] <MenZaLap> (And it's in the repos, wait a moment)
[12:45] <xarq> therealbigusdick: I use fluxbox because it's lighter-weight and I can remove *ALL* eye candy from the screen
[12:45] <MenZaLap> I'm using my apt
[12:45] <ifireball> therealbigusdick: also, try to compare the RAM usage before and after yuo open up the applications menu
[12:45] <MenZaLap> sa0: sudo apt-get install firefox-themes-ubuntu
[12:46] <MenZaLap> It might be in either multi- or universe
[12:46] <sa0> let me try it

[12:47] <destruction> hmm
[12:47] <Feldegast> MenZaLap is the flash9 bets compatable with 64bit?
[12:47] <sa0> sorry MenZaLap
[12:48] <Feldegast> *beta
[12:48] <MenZaLap> Feldegast: I doubt it
[12:48] <sa0> no result
[12:48] <netG> grodius : you can also try "automatix" it installs flash9
[12:48] <therealbigusdick> Feldegast, it is not
[12:48] <MenZaLap> Possibly
[12:48] <MenZaLap> sa0: have you enabled multi- and universe?
[12:48] <sa0> yes
[12:48] <sa0> not the problem
[12:48] <therealbigusdick> Feldegast, and it doesn't work properly on amd64 when running it inside a chroot
[12:48] <sa0> it's a GTK problem

[12:48] <Feldegast> therealbigusdick ty, i wasn't going to go that far :)
[12:48] <MenZaLap> You have to download themes for it

[12:53] <fooadd> or you can run  gnome-theme-manger, and close it every time you log to fluxbox, like I used to do before knowing about this gtkrc thing :P
[12:53] <fooadd> michaels_, start by running smbclient -L $name_of_windows_box (??)
[12:53] <xarq> fooadd: nah, just run gtk-theme-switch2 and it sticks permanently
[12:54] <fooadd> michaels_, then smbmount it
[12:54] <ifireball> michaels_: either go into Places->Network Servers or Places->Connect to Server
[12:54] <michaels_> ifireball: xubuntu, not ubuntu
[12:54] <sa0> but when i try install theme in gtk-theme-switch2 i got an error trying to save the theme xarq

[12:54] <ifireball> michaels_: using thunar file manager?
[12:54] <michaels_> ifireball: so far
[12:55] <xarq> sa0: hmm.. I just copy my themes to ~/.themes

[12:55] <n0mak> woohoo, after few hours of f*cking around I finnaly got my videos working :D
[12:55] <DaveHope> Hello All. I've got an issue with some hardware where when installing, powernow gets installed. The problem with this is that the system locks up when setting the frequency, which occurs when the service is started. So on first boot, the system instantly dies. So, my question is what package should I report the bug under ? debian-installer for installing it on a system which doesn't support it, or powernowd (or whatever) ?
[12:55] <fooadd> n0mak,  hehe, and what was the solution?
[12:56] <ifireball> michaels_: I think it has SMB support somewhere try isgn "go" (or whatever was the command to open a folder by URL) and entering an smb:// URL
[12:56] <xarq> sa0: yeah, /home/sa0 definitely isn't a tarball or theme directory
[12:56] <scheuri> anyone knowing of a good c64-emulator? and maybe even of a site to get some games?
[12:56] <michaels_> fooadd, how do I smbmount?
[12:56] <n0mak> I ininstalled most of the packages from synaptic package manager -> multimedia
[12:56] <sa0> yeah xarq
[12:56] <sa0> but where to point at ?
[12:57] <n0mak> after installing and downloading all the stuff from the forum tutorials.
[12:57] <ifireball> michaels_: smbmount //compname/sharename /mount/point
[12:57] <xarq> sa0 you need to select a tarball you downloaded from gnome-look.org or whatever, or extract the tarball into ~/.themes
[12:57] <n0mak> fooadd, thanks for your help too :)
[12:57] <nickthorley> hi all - has anyone here moved to ubuntu from fedora and wouldnt mind having a chat in private - just wanted to find out what your thoughts were
[12:57] <therealbigusdick> DaveHope, I would say powernowd...
[12:57] <fooadd> n0mak,  I didn't help that much though :)
[12:57] <michaels_> ifireball, bash: smbmount: command not found

[12:58] <fooadd> michaels_,  http://myy.helia.fi/~karte/linux_as_a_client_to_windows_smb_shares.html
[12:58] <ifireball> michaels_: you might need to install it, let me check to which package it belongs
[12:58] <DaveHope> therealbigusdick: Thanks. Not actually bothered to report it as it's seems to be specific to this system, but since I'm due a re-install figure I should :)
[12:59] <n0mak> fooadd, still, I would be nowhere without any help. Sometimes all what someone needs is a tiny bit of help/information :)
[12:59] <fooadd> michaels_, apt-get install smbfs

[01:02] <fooadd> linux_fab,  huh???!
[01:02] <nickthorley> ifireball: i just want a quick unbloated desktop that is nice to look at - ideally similar to mac osx but quick also

[01:02] <xarq> lol
[01:03] <serialx_> Is upgrading dapper to egdy using apt-get hard?
[01:03] <nickthorley> ifireball: i am currently a fedora core user and interested in trying ubuntu
[01:03] <ifireball> nickthorley: have you used XFCE febore?
[01:03] <xarq> serialx_: it depends on whether you have package conflicts or not
[01:03] <nickthorley> ifireball: yes on fedora but quite a while ago
[01:03] <serialx_> gksu "update-manager -c" <- is this teminal capable? (console)
[01:03] <serialx_> I have a dapper server
[01:03] <Kurkoko> Hi!
[01:04] <serialx_> And I need python 2.5 and newer versions of tor and so on..
[01:04] <serialx_> Do I have to sudo update-manager -c ?
[01:04] <xarq> !upgrade
[01:04] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[01:04] <ifireball> nickthorley: if you're a Fedora user, afaik you'll pretty much feel at home on Gnome, I switched over when I reallised Fedora 4 was too broken to be useful, and when I realised they were going the YUM way despite APT being IMHO better
[01:04] <serialx_> I dont have any gnome or kde things (its a server)
[01:04] <serialx_> and I think gksu is dependant on gtk?
[01:05] <Kurkoko> Do someone got able to install ubuntu 6.06.1 or 6.10 on a motherboard based on nforce4chipset? installation doesnt recognise sata HDs,sound card and ethernet. Thanks
[01:05] <ifireball> nickthorley: any linux desktop can be made to look like OS-X but it takes some work on all of them
[01:05] <KillerDemon> serialx_ yum works fine too
[01:05] <michaels_> thanks fooadd and ifireball, the smbmount thing worked
[01:05] <brasko> hi, I'd like to print over samba
[01:05] <serialx_> yum?
[01:06] <brasko> the print dialog doesn't find the windows computer I want to connect to
[01:06] <brasko> is this a problem?
[01:06] <serialx_> I thought that was for fedora code? :)
[01:06] <nickthorley> ifireball: well my prob with fedora is that i have an adaptec sata raid card and they dont seem to support it - ubuntu may not when i try
[01:06] <xarq> nickthorley: I seem to recall seeing an xfce desktop which looked almost identical to OS X
[01:06] <blastradius> #abiword
[01:06] <brasko> it wants an address like 'smb:// ...', what do I put for the address?
[01:06] <blastradius> join /abiword
[01:06] <fooadd> brasko,  you are printing using what?
[01:06] <KillerDemon> serialx_ "and when I realised they were going the YUM way despite APT being IMHO better"
[01:06] <brasko> well, sorry, I'm trying to "setup a printer"
[01:07] <nickthorley> xarq: yes i think there is - i just like the little touches on osx like the volume gui popping up when you alter the controls etc
[01:07] <KillerDemon> apt is way slower
[01:07] <brasko> Applications->Settings->Printer
[01:07] <brasko> then clicked on "New Printer"
[01:07] <ifireball> nickthorley: things at tihs level, are pretty much kernel realted, not that manny differences among distros there, if the kernel supports it its only a matter of time and maybe some tweaking for any distro to support it
[01:07] <cowboylief> hi
[01:07] <serialx_> wt?? sudo: update-manager: command not found
[01:07] <serialx_> No update manager in my dapper server.
[01:07] <xarq> nickthorley: after using fluxbox for two weeks, I couldn't stand OS X anymore at work, and I've used a Mac for 20 years
[01:07] <serialx_> I knew it
[01:07] <MenZaLap> Is it possible to use different icons in Xfce?
[01:07] <serialx_> It's for the gui thigns..
[01:08] <brasko> I choose Samba printer, which is available, but the dialog can't find the machine that's running it.
[01:08] <nickthorley> ifireball: well that is what i thought - i was excited when fedora core 6 test 1 came out as it supported my card but the final release doesnt - not sure if its been dropped from the kernel in general
[01:08] <Kurkoko> Do someone got able to install ubuntu 6.06.1 or 6.10 on a motherboard based on nforce4chipset? installation doesnt recognise sata HDs,sound card and ethernet. Thanks
[01:08] <serialx_> Why Can't I upgrade to edgy when just using a server edition??
[01:08] <nickthorley> xarq: dont you find fluxbox a bit too basic
[01:08] <brasko> I'd really like to be able to print from ubuntu, instead of scp to the windows machine to print
[01:08] <jones20992> does anyone hear have any exp booting form flash with ubuntu ?
[01:09] <thez> hi! can somebody helps me eith diablo2 and cedega?
[01:09] <xarq> nickthorley: no, I run fullscreen emacs and fullscreen firefox, and try to get everything else to disappear, which it does in fluxbox
[01:10] <ifireball> nickthorley: I'm really unsure what is the nature of support or non-support her, it may just be a switch in some config file somewhere? did you try asking on the Fedora forums? I think such an issue is hardly a basis for a distro switch
[01:10] <nickthorley> ifireball: i did post on the forum but no responses
[01:11] <zoetrope86> does anyone have any idea why my internet connection is stable on windows, but flimsy on ubuntu? its really temperamental on here :(
[01:11] <ifireball> nickthorley: I see, does the ubuntu live-cd suports your card?

[01:12] <ifireball> nickthorley: ok. what exatly is the nature of the support/non support?
[01:12] <nickthorley> all i want is a really quick desktop that looks nice - think gnome is a bit bloated now
[01:13] <gerhard> nickthorley why dont you try that xfce 4
[01:13] <nickthorley> ifireball: with reference to the sata card you mean
[01:13] <therealbigusdick> nickthorley, if you think gnome is bloated wait to see kde ;)
[01:13] <ifireball> nickthorley: that depends on your hardware, in my experiance gnome is fine on any machine with more then 196MB of RAM
[01:13] <nickthorley> gerhard: i will once i get a distro on my machine i think i am taking
[01:13] <gerhard> ok
[01:13] <nickthorley> gerhard: sorry that is taking forward
[01:14] <gerhard> what do you mean?
[01:14] <xarq> nickthorley: I personally find that's a matter of going to gnome-look.org and grabbing pretty themes for fluxbox or any other gtk2 supported themed window manager
[01:15] <jones20992> any body hear know much about writeing scripts
[01:15] <Kurkoko> Do someone got able to install ubuntu 6.06.1 or 6.10 on a motherboard based on nforce4chipset? installation doesnt recognise sata HDs,sound card and ethernet. Thanks searching on forums and no luck :(
[01:15] <zoetrope86> does anyone know how to make my internet connection more stable on ubuntu? im getting disconnected a lot more frequently on here than on windows - like sometimes after only a few minutes - and its getting a bit expensive
[01:15] <ifireball> nickthorley: I'm using XFCE as we speak, but I think it lacks some featres if you want most things to "just work"
[01:16] <enkidu> how to convert files between mpeg and mov ?
[01:16] <GarethMB> VLC?
[01:16] <gerhard> ifireball, thats what i heard about xfce but i never tested it
[01:16] <enkidu> GarethMB: vlc can do that ?
[01:16] <ifireball> xarq: sorry I can't agree here, a desktop environment is a whole lot more then a window manager, using something like fluxbox or fvwm does not make for a comelete desktop experiance unless the consloe is your file manager and vi is your editor
[01:17] <gerhard> does anyone here know Phase6 ?
[01:17] <xarq> ifireball: yes, and emacs is an OS in and of itself, hence I don't need a desktop environment
[01:17] <Feldegast> fvwn+mc?
[01:17] <_deeproot_123> Hi
[01:19] <ifireball> xarq: well, that is one use acse, it doesn't fit for everyone, also EMACS is UGLY IMHO, (I was a user for years, quite when I realised its UTF8 support isn't going to reach any distro any time soon)
[01:19] <nickthorley> ifireball: would you mind sending me a screenshot of your desktop - would be interested in seeing how it looks
[01:19] <GarethMB> enkidu, yes i believe so with the streaming/ transcoding wizard
[01:19] <mikewhln> hi, I installed network manager applet. how do I make it appear as an applet?
[01:19] <xarq> ifireball: I wasn't prescribing it to anyone
[01:19] <ifireball> nickthorley: the Xfce one? I warn you its not what you'll get when loading Xubuntu for the 1st time
[01:20] <nickthorley> ifireball: no its ok - just interested in seeing what can be done
[01:21] <livingdaylight> does anyone else experience closing Xchat down normally as being detected as a crash by the system?
[01:21] <gerhard> what do I do when I get the message that one cannot open an image due to not being ISO 9660 ? Is there a converter?
[01:21] <xarq> <xarq> nickthorley: I seem to recall seeing an xfce desktop which looked
[01:21] <xarq>        almost identical to OS X
[01:22] <xarq> ifireball: and that's definitely not my personal preference.. I hate xfce more than almost anything

[01:52] <coz_> suavsilk, open?
[01:52] <suavsilk> coz_ i had it open the whole time, fooadd yes
[01:52] <coz_> suavsilk, search for sun-java
[01:52] <Poromenos> Crazed: right click on the gnome top bar and add the terminal server client button
[01:52] <Poromenos> you can connect with that
[01:52] <fooadd> suavsilk,  I mean if apt-get is running/installing something, you can't use apt-get or synaptic, that's what the error message said

[01:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about beer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:54] <suavsilk> coz_ sun-java is in the list on the left under 'All' but nothing is in the main list 'No Package is selected'

[01:54] <suavsilk> coz_ tryed reload, it did something however
[01:54] <coz_> suavsilk, ok search for it again
[01:55] <suavsilk> coz_ confirm i should be searching for 'sun-java' no spaces
[01:55] <coz_> suavsilk, right
[01:55] <Poromenos> has noone here tried to ping local hostnames?
[01:55] <suavsilk> coz_ no resaults
[01:55] <ifireball> stupidnewb: that depends on what is exactly in the tar file, if its a binary you just extract the tar file and maybe make some symlinks in your path, if its source you need to compile it and you may be better off getting a precompiled package with synaptic
[01:56] <coz_> suavsilk, go up undet synaptic settings then repositories
[01:56] <coz_> suavsilk, are the boxes checked there?
[01:57] <borndeer> is there anyone using ubuntu on laptop? I have problem with sounds

[02:25] <steur> hi
[02:25] <steur> i recently installed ubuntu
[02:25] <steur> and got some errors which was unable to fix
[02:25] <steur> can anybody help
[02:25] <steur> they're easy as im a newb and many of you may got the answers
[02:26] <kling0n> what errors?
[02:26] <steur> first of all
[02:26] <steur> i typed my username wrongly
[02:26] <steur> is it possibile to change it ?
[02:27] <Genrl_Zod> is it possible to have 2 OS's working in one session, and flip ebtween the 2?
[02:27] <Genrl_Zod> Like Linux and windows or is that never ever gonna happen
[02:28] <tom47> Genrl_Zod using vmware you can achieve that right now
[02:28] <Virtuall> Genrl_Zod, VMWare, Xen...
[02:29] <steur> also i cant open X
[02:29] <steur> cos of permissions
[02:29] <steur> in help page of ubuntu
[02:29] <kling0n> steur sudo vipw
[02:29] <steur> there arendt many details
[02:29] <variant> Genrl_Zod: forget vmware, qemu is at least as fast when using kqemu
[02:30] <steur> within terminal ?
[02:30] <steur> sudo vipw
[02:30] <gpastor> kqemu?
[02:30] <variant> Genrl_Zod: and you can apt-get install qemu, i use it to run windows server 2003 on one side of my aiglx cube :)
[02:30] <zoetrope666> what the f*ck? manga porn?
[02:30] <sioux> here i get crash after a while that i use usb wireless g-220 any ideas?
[02:30] <youser> i have a question
[02:30] <variant> gpastor: yes, a kernel module made by the creator of qemu (qemu is gpl licenced free software, kqemu is proprietry though)
[02:30] <youser> how to i back up a certain conf file?
[02:31] <variant> youser: cp /path/to/conf /path/to/conf.backup
[02:31] <youser> thank you
[02:31] <tom47> variant thats exactly why i use vmware .... no hoodwinking involved
[02:31] <variant> tom47: hoodwinking?
[02:32] <gpastor> variant, oh I see. However, it does speed any OS virtualized? or it only works being LInux the guest?
[02:32] <oslo> bootsplash problem: http://www.cannacola.free.fr/IMG_0011.JPG
[02:32] <oslo> only @ boot not @ shutdown
[02:32] <variant> gpastor: you can have any guest os, you can also use windows or linux as the host os
[02:32] <tom47> variant yes i am not interested in socalled open projects which lead you up to a point of functionality thenm drop commercialism on you
[02:32] <variant> tom47: it annoys me too, but i am less interested in totaly closed ones
[02:33] <variant> gpastor: the guest os will run with approximately 5% slowdown
[02:33] <tom47> honesty is what i look for ... if you are commercial have the guts and honesty to say so
[02:33] <variant> gpastor: if you have xen and a vt enabled cpu you can run your guest at near natiive speed
[02:33] <gpastor> variant, you are kidding? I thought that vmware run 50% slowdown.
[02:34] <gpastor> variant, I guess I am wrong :-P
[02:34] <variant> gpastor: I am talking about qemu, xen i have no idea about vmware
[02:35] <variant> gpastor: to run windows as a guest with xen you must have the supporting cpu, most dont yet support it though
[02:35] <gpastor> variant,  qemu + kqemu,
[02:35] <variant> gpastor: correct, you can run that on any cpu
[02:35] <tom47> i dont actually notice a difference between dapper in vm server and dapper running natively ... there MUST be a difference but i dont perceive it .... this is in a AMD 3500 cpu and a gig of mameory
[02:35] <gpastor> variant, I don't pretend to do such a thing, But it is important to be aware of these things
[02:36] <variant> gpastor: with qemu you could conceivably run winxp on an ipod :P would take centuries to do anything though :P
[02:36] <variant> tom47: yeah, its probably only a couple of percent performance drop
[02:36] <gpastor> variant, it would be nice to see what happens when touching the ipod wheel
[02:36] <variant> gpastor: bsod, of course :)
[02:37] <EdgeT> Guys got an important question bout multi-boot
[02:37] <variant> gpastor: you know you can boot a linux kernel on ipods right?
[02:38] <variant> gpastor: opens up more functionality, ability to watch movies, different audio formats, doom even
[02:38] <gpastor> variant, yes, I do.... but I don't have an ipod
[02:38] <variant> gpastor: damn, thought i was imparting new information :)
[02:38] <gpastor> variant, a friend of mine who has one, told me about (he didn't dare to do it though)
[02:38] <gpastor> :)
[02:39] <variant> gpastor: tell him it is easy and you can always reset to factory settings with the download from apple website
[02:39] <variant> gpastor: even if it goes badly wrong
[02:39] <EdgeT> Can I write to a new fat32 partition hosting WinXP?
[02:39] <gpastor> variant, but he needs to backup the songs ... I don't know if he wants to :-P
[02:39] <variant> EdgeT: from within ubuntu?
[02:40] <EdgeT> Yeah
[02:40] <variant> EdgeT: yes from within ubuntu you can
[02:40] <EdgeT> variant: yeah*
[02:40] <Jowi> I just replaced apache2 with lighttpd. can someone please test if http://www.burninghands.eu is accessible ?
[02:40] <EdgeT> variant: Does it automaticaly mount it?
[02:40] <variant> EdgeT: probably under /media/windows
[02:41] <^alien> Jowi: nope
[02:41] <variant> Jowi: nope
[02:41] <Jowi> ^alien, damn.
[02:41] <mike1o> firefox keeps using the gij 1.4 version despite me linking the sun plugin to it
[02:41] <EdgeT> variant: Cool thanks
[02:41] <mike1o> didnt read the response
[02:41] <EdgeT> variant: And what impact will a fat32 partition have on XP's performances plz?
[02:42] <variant> EdgeT: i have no idea, probably reduced performance
[02:42] <variant> EdgeT: why dont you use ntfs??

[02:42] <CharminTheMoose> question:is ubuntu able to resize NTFS fses?
[02:43] <tom47> EdgeT must have some but on any normal/recent pc its probably not perceivable either
[02:43] <variant> EdgeT: it is writeable nowadays from gnu/linux
[02:43] <variant> EdgeT: fat doesnt support anything like permissions
[02:43] <EdgeT> variant: That's experimental dude
[02:43] <variant> EdgeT: you would be better to use ntfs
[02:43] <EdgeT> variant: Yeah but it's only experimental software dude
[02:43] <variant> EdgeT: you can have full, safe read write access either will ntfs-ng or captive
[02:44] <MetaMorfoziS> how can i set up a fix ip for amachine on lan?
[02:44] <variant> EdgeT: i assure you that captive is completely safe, i have not tried ntfs-ng but i hear good things about it
[02:44] <CharminTheMoose> question:is the ubuntu live cd able to resize NTFS fses?
[02:44] <variant> CharminTheMoose: yes
[02:44] <EdgeT> variant: Captive?
[02:44] <CharminTheMoose> cool
[02:44] <variant> EdgeT: captive-ntfs, it runs the windows ntfs driver inside a wrapper
[02:45] <rogue780> is there any disadvantage to running gnome programs under kde and kde programs under gnome?
[02:45] <variant> rogue780: just hte lack of theme compatibility

[02:47] <variant> compengi: ps, the command
[02:48] <compengi> variant, yeah i know but i want a specific command for that
[02:49] <rogue780> hmm... I thought linux didn't have viruses, but the little virus scanner thing just found one
[02:49] <variant> compengi: what do you mean?
[02:49] <tom47> rogue780 what in?
[02:49] <variant> rogue780: probably either a windows virus or a test virus to ensure the database works
[02:49] <compengi> variant, i want to know how much for instance does xchat takes memory
[02:49] <variant> compengi: ps aux | grep COMMANDNAMEHERE
[02:49] <variant> compengi: ps aux | grep xchat
[02:50] <rogue780> vp31vfw.dll ... it's part of the win32 codecs
[02:50] <tom47> rogue780 sounds like a windows virus infected file ....
[02:50] <tom47> not a linux virus

[02:51] <rogue780> tom47: Aegis Virus Scanner. I got it through one of the update programs. probably from the PLF repo
[02:52] <tom47> rogue780 usually checking for viruses in linux is all about finding and eliminating windows virii so that you dont inadvertently pass them on ... you should cleanse it

[02:55] <rogue780> sorry if I sound kinda dumb, I'm a total linux noob
[02:55] <variant> mzli: ask in #ubuntu+1
[02:56] <mzli> variant: thnx, what's ubuntu+1 refer?
[02:56] <variant> mzli: feisty at the momment is ment for those who are fammilial with programming and might be capable of analizing a bug and submitting a bug report iwth even a patch, not for people that demand assistance because some feature doesnt work
[02:56] <tom47> rogue780 if you dont ask how will you ever know is what i always tell myself
[02:57] <variant> mzli: it is ubuntu development version discussion channel
[02:57] <mzli> variant: thnx , I know that. I just want to test it. :)
[02:57] <tom47> mzli ubuntu+1 translates into Current Realease Plus 1 ie edgy+1=feisty

[03:10] <sioux> hi folks
[03:10] <CorpseFeeder> If I look at this pastebin entry http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/00004/ gnome desktop crashes and restarts???? What's up with that?
[03:10] <Jasey> is RELAMPAGO looking for #ubuntu-es ?
[03:10] <sioux> how can i boot runlevel 3 on edgy?
[03:10] <fabiim> pradeep: the .deb file? , i
[03:11] <fabiim> pradeep: the .deb file? , if i downgrade it , will it affect my settings? bookmarks, etc.?
[03:11] <sioux> boot a edgy with no xorg just consolle
[03:11] <pradeep> fabiim, iirc the settings/plugins are stored in your home directory
[03:12] <pradeep> fabiim, get the tar.gz and extract it to a place in your home
[03:12] <CorpseFeeder> does this web page http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/00004/ crash everyone's computer or just mine? it crashes when you try to move the scroll bar of the paste.
[03:14] <sioux> so how can i boot a runlevel 3 on edgy? no xorg just consolle?
[03:14] <fabiim> pradeep:  ok , i know my way around then , just trying to see if a .deb solution exists . thanks =)
[03:14] <Jasey> to boot into that, pick Single user/Recovery mode in the grub menu =\
[03:14] <roryy> sioux: switch to a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), login and run 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'   -- there's no direct equivalent of runlevel 3/5 as in redhat etc
[03:14] <pradeep> fabiim, you could get the 1.5 ver from the dapper repos .. it should work
[03:14] <ifireball> Jasey, sioux: that bute isnto single-mode not runlevel 3
[03:15] <X1F35QZH> hi, after editing xorg.conf and /etc/firefox/firefoxrc firefox still crashes  in edgy.
[03:15] <Jasey> oh
[03:15] <ifireball> Jasey: I ment boots my typing is way off today...
[03:15] <X1F35QZH> I am quite desperate
[03:16] <X1F35QZH> would anyone know how to help please?
[03:17] <ifireball> X1F35QZH: did you try creating a new user and running FF as that user? many firefox-related problems are due to the config files in your home-dir
[03:17] <CorpseFeeder> is this crash I am experiencing a problem with edgy only?
[03:17] <Jasey> ya, try removing the .mozilla folder in /home/foo, X1F35QZH
[03:18] <X1F35QZH> Ok will give a try thanks a lot
[03:19] <sioux> roryy thank you ctrl+alt+f1 did what i need
[03:19] <CorpseFeeder> someone else goto here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/00004/ with firefox and see if it crashes your machine when you move the scroll bar on the text box.
[03:19] <gpastor> The modem tool seems to be broken at edgy. Is this an known problem?
[03:20] <Jasey> dont seem to have any problem with that in opera and konqueror, CorpseFeeder. just fyi
[03:20] <roryy> CorpseFeeder: I can move both scrollbars on that page without crashing
[03:20] <roryy> CorpseFeeder: (this is using ff2 on edgy).  Do you have any extensions installed?
[03:20] <madsen> wazzzup with the iso-8859-1 charset in debian xterm?  my danish charset wont show properly?  can anyone help
[03:20] <CorpseFeeder> weird.. it must be just me then.. I crash the computer every time on that page :/
[03:21] <CorpseFeeder> other pastes I have no problem with.
[03:21] <CorpseFeeder> it's just that one which crashes my computer
[03:22] <madsen> 
[03:22] <roryy> madsen: this channel is for ubuntu. afaik, ubuntu uses utf-8 for most (all?) applications
[03:22] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: no crashes here as well, this may be font-related since I see more then one unrecognised character there
[03:22] <madsen> roryy: i know.. using xubuntu... think i've tried almost everything
[03:23] <fiveiron> uh... hmm.. shouldn't my laptop come out of suspend mode when i move the mouse?
[03:23] <roryy> madsen: you have a iso-8859-1 encoded file?
[03:23] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: also, did you try changing your theme-engine?
[03:24] <CorpseFeeder> what theme engine?
[03:24] <madsen> roryy: ehmm should i?  shouldn't it be supported default?
[03:25] <roryy> madsen: i'm not sure, but i suspect utf-8 would be better
[03:25] <gnomefreak> theme engine == GTK2
[03:25] <CorpseFeeder> what is theme engine?
[03:25] <madsen> roryy: everything else works fine in danish... but in irssi/ssh it just wont show right
[03:25] <roryy> oh
[03:25] <gnomefreak> for ubuntu  for kde == QT
[03:26] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: its whats makes widgets (buttons, checkboxes, etc.) in GTK look in a certain way, changing a desktop theme may change your theme engine (several themes use the asme theme engine, essetially themes that look radically different from each other ususally don't use the same theme engine)
[03:26] <roryy> madsen: what machine are you ssh'ing into? also ubuntu, or something else?
[03:26] <daxxar> Did edgy (from dapper) add some kind of paralellized boot-ordering? Can I disable this?
[03:27] <CorpseFeeder> ok.. well in that case, yes. I think I have changed my theme engine.
[03:27] <madsen> roryy: a normal debian....works fine on that on local and via win32/putty
[03:27] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: and the roblem occurs in all theme engines you've tried?
[03:27] <roryy> madsen: i had issues using putty ssh'ing into an ubuntu machine until i told putty to use utf-8
[03:27] <CorpseFeeder> i have not tried any other theme
[03:28] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: you don't mind trying do you?
[03:28] <RegalEagle> Is there any way I can add higher resolutions than 1024x768 inside of Ubuntu?
[03:28] <roryy> madsen: maybe you can ask either ssh or irssi to work in utf-8; maybe 'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irssi'  (that's a guess)
[03:28] <RegalEagle> Or do I have to reinstall to get them?
[03:28] <rogue780> how do I set the default programs in gnome?
[03:28] <CorpseFeeder> apparently I am using "industrial tango" I will change to default and see if I still crash on that page.
[03:28] <ifireball> gnomefreak: Firefox uses GTK regardless of your desktop environment
[03:28] <madsen> roryy: my problem is that danish charset has 3 special letters which the english alpabet does't have... they are screwed
[03:29] <gnomefreak> ifireball: correct
[03:29] <gnomefreak> ifireball: i dont think that issue is related to the theme engine. maybe the rendering engine try with a non gecko browser
[03:29] <RegalEagle> !resolution
[03:29] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[03:29] <madsen> roryy: I dont know how?  any clue?
[03:29] <roryy> madsen: my limited understanding of the problem is that your debian system is outputting chars in iso-8859-1, and ubuntu is interpreting them as utf-8
[03:30] <madsen> roryy: youre absolute correct.. that my problem hes
[03:30] <madsen> yes
[03:30] <madsen> arhg +ly :))
[03:30] <roryy> madsen: can you try launching irssi with that LANG setting? Like this:   'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irssi'
[03:30] <jimle> hello, has anyone been able to get rhythmbox to play mp3's from a samba share (6.10)
[03:30] <madsen> roryy: how do i set lang in irssi?
[03:31] <gnomefreak> roryy: never tried but i dont htink it will take those args. irssi uses whatever your language is set to system wide
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> lol any one, command to get my IP?
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> as in local machine ip on the network
[03:31] <gnomefreak> Cyber_Stalker: ifconfig
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> IF
[03:31] <roryy> gnomefreak: so it doesn't use 'setlocale()' ?
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> knew it was something similar to ip
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> :P
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> thanks alot GnarlyBob
[03:31] <CorpseFeeder> well that didn't work. It crashed me the instant I moved the scroll bar.
[03:31] <Cyber_Stalker> gnomefreak**
[03:31] <roryy> gnomefreak: any ideas?
[03:31] <anthonykid> all: i need help
[03:31] <gnomefreak> roryy: i havent seen anywhere that it does
[03:32] <roryy> hrm
[03:32] <gnomefreak> roryy: look in the config file there might be one but i dont remember seeing it
[03:32] <anthonykid> for some reason, non of my hardware is accepting any keyboard/mouse events during startup
[03:32] <anthonykid> so i cant choose and options when booting from the ubuntu disc
=== satu_aja is now known as cw
[03:32] <roryy> madsen: well, I suggest just trying the 'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irrsi' option; if that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas
[03:33] <roryy> madsen: otherwise pester gnomefreak for irssi help -- I use erc ;)
[03:33] <gnomefreak> change the terminal language?
[03:33] <madsen> roryy: erc?
[03:33] <madsen> gnomefreak: yes.. but how?
[03:33] <roryy> madsen: emacs irc client
[03:33] <gnomefreak> brb looking to see if i find it in conf
[03:33] <madsen> ohh
=== Linuturk_zZz is now known as Linuturk
[03:34] <ifireball> madsen: let me see if I get your problem rigt, you're running irssi on a debian machine into which you are ssh-ing from an ubuntu box, and getting gibrish?
[03:34] <anthonykid> anyone... ubuntu's partioner has been running since last night, and just wont finish
[03:34] <anthonykid> will i have to clean install?
[03:34] <gino> Hey, I have 2 questions, 1)For somereason Gnome-panel or nautilus won't start at all, how can I start that so I can do anything? 2) How can I change my Nickname in IRSSI?
[03:35] <CorpseFeeder> something else weird I've noticed... I can't copy and paste the URL "http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/00004/" from firefox ( I have to retype it here) and it does not appear in firefox's history.
[03:35] <madsen> ifireball: correct... danish letters are screwed
[03:35] <gnomefreak> madsen: irssi uses the terminal set language. you might beable to send that arg with it but i doubt it will work.
[03:35] <codeshepherd> i am unable to get into single user mode in my ubuntu box.. i appended linux single in the grub menu.. and booted the machine.. it  puts up a message saying give root password for maintenance ..  or Control-D to continue..
[03:36] <roryy> madsen: try it already and tell us what happens ;). I'm curious
[03:36] <CorpseFeeder> I can copy paste it only when the page remains open in firefox browser.. if I close the browser, the text in the clipboard is lost.
[03:36] <jimle> hello, has anyone been able to get rhythmbox to play mp3's from a samba share (using 6.10)
[03:36] <asdfr> hi, does anyone know the regular expression to match every set of brackets and their contents?
[03:36] <gnomefreak> madsen: and i know with gnome-terminal it uses system wide lang.
[03:37] <ruben> Hi, how can I kill this session? root     tty1     -                29Oct06 13days  0.00s  0.00s -su
[03:37] <daxxar> Hm. Upstart seems to run things in paralell, is that correct? Can I stop it?
[03:37] <madsen> ok.. im using xfce?  should that be any different?
[03:37] <ifireball> madsen: well, you need to mach up the charsets in both systems, you can either run your ubuntu window in the Debian charset or run the apps on debina in UTF-8 both things can be accomplished by playing with the locale environment variables
[03:37] <tom47> anthonykid what else is installed on the pc?
[03:38] <madsen> Generating locales... da_DK.ISO_8859-1... up-to-date
[03:38] <madsen> should right yes?
[03:38] <roryy> hmm
[03:38] <ifireball> madsen: a better long-term solution would be to make the denian system use UTF-8
[03:38] <roryy> madsen: ideally you want a da_DK.UTF-8
[03:38] <roryy> (sorry I got the country wrong before)
[03:38] <daxxar> After I upgraded from Dapper to Edgy, X doesn't work. I do 'startx', and it says "xauth: creating new authority file ..", then waits almost a minute, and says "xinit: connection refused (errno 111): unable to connect to X server", "xinit: No such process (errno 3): Server error".
[03:38] <_3uG_> does anyone know of a sniffer that can grab urls out of packets? i'm trying to fix a malformed flash url
[03:38] <daxxar> Any suggestions as to what I should look at, or what could be wrong?
[03:38] <madsen> ifireball: nope.. then that wont' show the 3 special danish letters either?
[03:39] <engla> daxxar: running startx as a user?
[03:39] <rogue780> does anyone know how thunderbird stores e-mail messages? is it in a directory or a database of some sort?
[03:39] <TGPO> daxxar did you read the upgrade instructions?
[03:39] <roryy> daxxar: maybe the auth file (~/.ICEauthority, I think) has funny ownership or permissions
[03:39] <_3uG_> daxxar, could it be a permission problem?
[03:39] <yrk> does dapper drake come with an NTPL or linuxthreads glibc?
[03:39] <daxxar> startx as a user, yes.
[03:39] <ifireball> madsen: afaik UTF-8 is a superset of whatever your're using, it should be able to dispaly the characters you need
[03:39] <gnomefreak> rogue780: there is a emails folder in the ~/.mozilla/thunderbird file iirc. or there might be a ~/.thunderbird file
[03:40] <daxxar> TGPO, I found a tutorial, I changed apt-sources, did apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:40] <TGPO> daxxar, this is covered in the upgrade instructions listed in the topic
[03:40] <engla> in dapper and edgy it's configured so that x cannot start unless root?
[03:40] <daxxar> Oh, haven't seen that one, thanks.
[03:40] <gnomefreak> engla: no
[03:40] <CorpseFeeder> if the problem with viewing that pastebin page is font related, would there be any way to fix this?
[03:40] <martyyyr> how do I find the latest version of a driver? (broadcom wireless lan  driver)
[03:40] <tom47> rogue780 thunderbird uses mbx
[03:40] <madsen> ifireball: i'll give it a go
[03:40] <gnomefreak> engla: that was a bug but fixed long long time ago
[03:41] <engla> ok. I thought it wasn't a bug
[03:41] <rogue780> I'm trying to figure out how to import e-mail messages from another hard drive that used thunderbird to my current setup
[03:41] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: did you try changing a theme engine?
[03:41] <rogue780> I can still boot the other hard drive, so if anyone knows how to export/import thunderbird messages, that'd be great too.
[03:41] <CorpseFeeder> ifireball: changing the theme engine made no difference. It still crashes.
[03:41] <ifireball> rogue780: the messages are probably in some hidden  directory in your home-dir
[03:42] <_3uG_> rogue780, you should just be able to copy the whole .mozilla-thunderbird (or whatever...) directory and use it that way
[03:42] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: did you restart FF after switching the theme?
[03:42] <_3uG_> rogue780, it worked fine for me twice
[03:42] <anthonykid> all: when i opt to install ubuntu via the live CD, it never finishes the partitioning of my HDD... the disc doesn't freeze, it just never finishes
[03:42] <anthonykid> any ideas
[03:42] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: which theme are you using? which theme did you try?
[03:42] <rogue780> _3uG_:thanks
[03:42] <tom47> anthonykid try running it from scratch again
[03:42] <_3uG_> rogue780, no problem.. upon first run, it should pick everything up
[03:42] <anthonykid> alright
[03:43] <anthonykid> tom47: when you say from scratch, are you implying i reboot?
[03:43] <CorpseFeeder> erm... I can't remember if firefox was restarted or not... I tried default theme and industrial tango theme
[03:43] <gino> To start nautilus, what would I put as the display? I'm in a tty and when I enter "nautilus" it says "Can not open display: "
[03:43] <gino> I want to open nautilus in TTY7.
[03:43] <tom47> anthonykid yes unless there is some reason not to
[03:43] <anthonykid> tom47: no, i can, i just wanted to make sure
[03:44] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: hmm... I'm using IndustrialTango and no crashes ehre, I guess its not the theme engine's fault
[03:44] <anthonykid> tom47: does this mean anything "Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 1149247" ?
[03:44] <anthonykid> tom47, i got that the last time i booted but i still got to the live CD fine
[03:44] <tom47> rogue780 i recently migrated from evolution to thunderbird and used this article as my guide ... http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/10/1446217&tid=37&tid=101
[03:44] <ifireball> CorpseFeeder: are you using any kind of a FF extention that might mess with that stuff?
[03:44] <__osh__> Is there an alternative way to install ubuntu? Say from an usb-stick?
[03:45] <tom47> anthonykid no sorry i cant help woith that
[03:45] <anthonykid> alright, thanks tom47
[03:45] <gnomefreak> !install | __osh__
[03:45] <ubotu> __osh__: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[03:45] <mzli> __osh__: hard disk.
[03:45] <CorpseFeeder> i am using edgy eft. I don't know what firefox extensions might "mess with that stuff"
[03:45] <rsl> What does "sudo esd" accomplish? I read on the forums that it might solve my problem with sound and it in fact did! But I'd like to know what it's doing.
[03:45] <gnomefreak> CorpseFeeder: it could be any. how many have you installed from mozilla?
[03:46] <_3uG_> rsl, it's running the sound server as root (possible security risk..)
[03:46] <reflect> evening, I'm looking for betatesters for something I'm putting together..   not sure if this is the right place to ask..
[03:46] <variant> reflect: it is not
[03:46] <CorpseFeeder> i have some plug-ins installed in firefox
[03:46] <variant> reflect: try the ubuntu forum
[03:46] <gnomefreak> start disabling them one by one until it no longer crashes (same with themes)
[03:46] <reflect> variant: thanks
[03:46] <rsl> _3uG_, hrm... It should be running already though, shouldn't it?
[03:46] <connie_lh> Hello! I'm a first time linux user with a few questions. I hope you can help me! :) The first is how do I make a daemon work at startup? (what file do I place it's start command in?)
[03:47] <martyyyr> has anyone here used the bcm43xx-fwcutter?
[03:47] <tom47> anthonykid is it a DELL you are using?
[03:47] <Terminus> connie_lh: what daemon?
[03:47] <connie_lh> mtd
[03:47] <ifireball> connie_lh: which distro are you using?
[03:47] <Terminus> connie_lh: errr... what's mtd?
[03:47] <connie_lh> terminus: mtd is the myth transcoding daemon
[03:48] <_3uG_> rsl, yeah, it should be running along with your window manager (i think..), but it's also not the best sound daemon.. do you have alsa installed?
[03:48] <Terminus> connie_lh: oh ok. sorry. don't know anything about myth.
[03:48] <anthonykid> tom47: hell no, i hate Dell, it's a Systemax
[03:48] <ifireball> !mtd
[03:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mtd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:48] <strabes> connie_lh: type gnome-session-properties into a terminal window and then go to the startup programs
[03:48] <connie_lh> ifireball: It's (x)ubuntu 6.10
[03:48] <tom47> ok
[03:48] <jimle> hello, has anyone been able to get rhythmbox to play mp3's from a samba share (using 6.10)
[03:48] <strabes> connie_lh: if you want to make a startup script, that's a little more compicated
[03:48] <ifireball> connie_lh: is the deamon system-wide or per-user?
[03:48] <anthonykid> tom47 about how long should the partitioner take?
[03:48] <rogue780> does anyone know how to setup get get running the jack audio daemon?
[03:48] <connie_lh> ifireball: System wide. The command is 'mtd -d
[03:49] <tom47> anthonykid you are not the first with this problem bu there was no solution provided to the other guy either :(
[03:49] <tom47> anthonykid a few minutes
[03:49] <rsl> _3uG_, I do have alsa but was having horrible sound issues which I can't find anyone else anywhere [on the forums, Google, etc]  having. I saw someone used sudo esd to start esd and it worked for me. No more jammed up sound.
[03:49] <anthonykid> meh..
[03:49] <CorpseFeeder> are plug-ins the same thing as extensions? PLug-ins I have in firefox are totem player, real player, flash 9 player, windows media player, divx player, quicktime player, and java.
[03:49] <anthonykid> tom47 what if i clean installed? what are the chances it'll work better then?
[03:49] <fire> hi does anyone know how to make a wireless cardbus card work in ubuntu?
[03:49] <ifireball> connie_lh: well, since you're running Edgy, its a tad different then any other Linux sich it has a new startup system
[03:49] <tom47> 'anthonykid what do you mean by cleaninstall?
[03:50] <martyyyr> has anyone here used the bcm43xx-fwcutter?
[03:50] <ifireball> connie_lh: are you sure there is no precompiled package for ubuntu that will save you the work?
[03:50] <martyyyr> fire, what card?
[03:50] <anthonykid> tom47 when i install ubuntu (step 5) i choose to partition my disk and then install on the free space
[03:50] <anthonykid> tom47 AHH nevermind, got it! thanks!
[03:50] <connie_lh> ifireball: Yes. The mythtv package was already downloaded with its plugins but mtd isn't started by default.
[03:51] <anthonykid> alright, here we go :-D
[03:51] <rsl> Does ubuntu set a size limit on /var/log?
[03:51] <pianoboy3333> What are good programs to use that rip dvd's? I'ved tried like mencoder and acidrip, but the sound goes out of sync, lemonrip doesn't have enough customability, any other ideas?
[03:51] <fire> martyyyr, i did not understand what you ment by what card
[03:51] <tom47> anthonykid good luck lol
[03:51] <connie_lh> ifireball: MythTv in general needs a bit of attention if the goal is to get it working out-of-the box. Whew! It's been 3 days configuring it by hand!
[03:52] <anthonykid> tom47 is the live CD generally slower than an actual HDD disk?
[03:52] <martyyyr> fire, you're trying to get a wireless netword card working, right?
[03:52] <strabes> pianoboy3333: try dvdrip
[03:52] <martyyyr> which one?
[03:52] <tom47> always
[03:52] <fire> yes
[03:52] <Vermyndax> can someone tell me what to symlink on ubuntu dapper server to get the "mail" command to work?
[03:52] <madsen> here goes
[03:52] <shwouchk> hi
[03:52] <anthonykid> alright, thanks
[03:52] <madsen> brb
[03:52] <fire> martyyyr,  yes, a sitecom card
[03:52] <anthonykid> am i the only one here with Mac?
[03:52] <prestosd> i dont have a mac
[03:52] <martyyyr> fire, have you searched in the wiki?
[03:53] <prestosd> can anyone help me with a 3d graphics problem?
[03:53] <strabes> !ask
[03:53] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:53] <anthonykid> from what i've seen, ubuntu seems very limited :-/
[03:53] <ifireball> connie_lh: well, maybe someone will try and make a "mediabuntu" at some point, no much demant at this point it seems, otherwish someone might have made it already
[03:53] <fire> what wiki?
[03:53] <strabes> anthonykid: then you haven't seen very much
[03:53] <anthonykid> i hope
[03:53] <CorpseFeeder> i don't think I have any firefox extensions.. only plugins.. and if plugins is not extensions, could one of the plugins I mentioned be causing firefox to crash the gnome desktop environment?
[03:53] <martyyyr> fire: http://wiki.ubuntu.com
[03:53] <fire> martyyyr, thx
[03:54] <anthonykid> i mean, vital applications such as the CS2 suite, any Macromedia apps, media applications... they just don't seem to be there
[03:54] <madsen> hmm
[03:54] <connie_lh> ifireball: I heard the mythtv developer wants to make his next official mythtv distro based on ubuntu to replace KnoppMyth, I guess.
[03:54] <Ries> pohey gius, where can I find information how to use libapache2-mod-fcgid together with php5?
[03:54] <anthonykid> but i did hear that CS3 will be linux compatible :-D
[03:54] <shwouchk> I'm installing ubuntu server in LAMP mode... I wanted to ask what extra stuff I need to configure afterwards for it to be fully functional?
[03:54] <Ries> I have followed a couple of modfgi manuals but thet don't seems to do teh job with libapache2-mod-fcgid

[03:55] <anthonykid> there was an article commenting on adobe's outloud decision
[03:55] <Zaggynl> Anyone gaming on edgy?

[03:56] <CorpseFeeder> is there a way to disable the flash 9 plugin on firefox so I can test if the web page still crashes the computer?

[03:56] <andreuu> hi, whats that program that installs a whole heap of stuff, like irc and nvidia drivers etc
[03:56] <Zaggynl> automatix and easyubuntu, BUT don't use those :/
[03:56] <connie_lh> andreuu: Automatix
[03:57] <anthonykid> variant: digg is rarely incorrect, from what i've seen in the past few months
[03:57] <anthonykid> no no no
[03:57] <Jowi> CorpseFeeder, simple move the plugin out of the plugins directory and restart firefox
[03:57] <anthonykid> andreuu: DONT use automatix!
[03:57] <ifireball> madsen: you can't jsut change locale to whatever yuo want, you need to have the proper locale files on your system, the right way to change a local is to chaneg the setting locally in a console window and run the commant "locale" to see if it yields any errors beforedoing anything system-wide

[04:02] <PaulCarpenter> hey guys. I was wondering if anyone knew whether I ubuntu will run OK on a "dual core" machine, and if I need a specific build for that.
[04:02] <ambimom> Dapper is more stable than edgy
[04:02] <anthonykid> variant: im still looking for it...
[04:02] <shwouchk> is webmin available in apt-get?
[04:03] <Jowi> !info webmin
[04:03] <ubotu> Package webmin does not exist in any distro I know
[04:03] <anthonykid> meh... i cant find it anywhere, but i KNOW i saw it a few weeks ago
[04:03] <anthonykid> i remember telling a few people via AIM
[04:03] <Terminus> PaulCarpenter: it'll run fine. you might want to install a smp kernel to take advantage of it though.
[04:03] <variant> shwouchk: apt-cache search webmin
[04:03] <PaulCarpenter> cool, thanks.
[04:03] <connie_lh> ifireball: Hrrrm. :/ Well, then, they should take it out! Getting my hope up like that with talk of executing scripts!
[04:03] <ambimom> TLTS podcast did episode on webmin
[04:03] <andreuu> thanks for info, i am haing problems install nvidia drivers for 7600gt is all
=== pc3 is now known as CW_ASMARA
[04:04] <ifireball> connie_lh: are we talking a backend or a frondend machine here?
[04:04] <connie_lh> ifireball: One in the same.
[04:04] <tom47> variant my reading of easyubuntu indicates that there is as yet no edgy version available
[04:04] <etla> hi, what is the easiest way to upgrade from 5.10 to 6.06 ?
[04:04] <variant> tom47: no idea, i have never used it
[04:04] <ambimom> tom47: Automatix 2 is for Edgy
[04:04] <variant> tom47: its pointless imo
[04:04] <connie_lh> ifireball: In order to rip or transcode I have to have mtd running as a daemon.
[04:04] <tom47> variant no me neither but it seems a useful thing to be aware of

[04:04] <Jowi> !upgrade
[04:04] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[04:05] <ambimom> etla:  do a clean install
[04:05] <anthonykid> all: apparently, @ startup ubuntu only reacts to ps/2 mouse/keyboard... can i fix this?
[04:05] <Jowi> etla, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades
[04:05] <tom47> ambimom yes i guess but i prefer to do it the long winded way as outlined in Restricted Formats
[04:05] <ifireball> connie_lh: seems the package installs mythtv-* services in your home dir, are you sure none of them run mtd for you?
[04:06] <ambimom> tom47:  go for it then! LOL
[04:06] <etla> Jowi: thanks, I'll read that, I'd like to save my files so a clean install is not attractive
[04:06] <tom47> lol
[04:06] <ifireball> connie_lh: I mea your /etc/init.d dir
[04:06] <Jowi> etla, I upgraded that way just fine. Make sure you have package "ubuntu-desktop" installed and (for me at least) openoffice removed
[04:07] <hanso> hey. I installed vlc but when I try to stream from a website there is only a black screen where the video should be saying (no video). what can be wrong?
[04:07] <nothlit> Hello, can someone tell me why my package is taking forever to set up and scrollkeeper-update -q is taking up all the resources?
[04:07] <connie_lh> ifireball: Yup. Like I said. It seems like one of those weird oversights. But it also makes sense. MTD isn't a toy -- it's fairly aggressive and consumes a fair bit of resources
[04:07] <martyyyr> has anyone here used the bcm43xx-fwcutter?
[04:08] <Toppy> does anybody know how to enable fingerprint recognition?
[04:08] <CorpseFeeder> ok - I removed flash 9 plugin from firefox and will now test if that crazy  web page still crashes my computer...
[04:08] <nothlit> hanso, install mozilla-plugin-vlc  and close firefox before you do it
[04:08] <ambimom> Is there a reason my microphone doesn't work in virtual dapper but does in the XP?
[04:08] <tom47> martyyyr if its a 4318 chip then i know someone who has given up on it
[04:08] <martyyyr> it's 4306
[04:08] <ifireball> connie_lh: looking at the wiki, they seem to recommand having your custom xsession run mtd (which means its a user daemon not a system daemon...)
[04:08] <tom47> ok sound spromising then
[04:09] <martyyyr> yeah...but.... when I do the fwcutter thing, it tells me "Sorry, it's not possible to extract "bcm43xx_microcode11.fw".
[04:09] <ortega10> i upgraded to edgy, but i liked the old clearlooks theme better... how do i go back?
[04:09] <martyyyr> and something about extacting firmware from an old driver
[04:09] <connie_lh> ifireball: Okay. Err. How would I do that?
[04:09] <tom47> martyyyr i have not had reason to use it myself but there is a thread in ubuntu forums dealing extensively with that subject
[04:09] <Toppy> does anybody know how to enable fingerprint recognition?
[04:09] <martyyyr> I'll try looking for it
[04:10] <Toppy> !fingerprint recogniton
[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fingerprint recogniton - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:10] <CorpseFeeder> nope, flash plugin was not the problem. I still crash on that page.
[04:10] <martyyyr> I found a lot of info on the fwcutter, but I think that my main problem is that I can't find the newest divers
[04:10] <ifireball> connie_lh: did you craete a /usr/share/xsessions/mythtv.desktop file like they instruct in the wiki?
[04:10] <gravyface> Im trying to fiddle with Intel i815 drivers in Xubuntu Edgy but when it dumps me to the shell after dpkg reconfiguring xorg, I don't know how to restart x11/xorg/"the desktop".  Whats the shell command for this?  I've been rebooting.
[04:11] <Toppy> guys pls help me!
[04:11] <connie_lh> ifireball: Yes.
[04:11] <Arcad1> with what?
[04:11] <ortega10> i upgraded to edgy, but i liked the old clearlooks theme better... how do i go back ?
[04:11] <ambimom> ortega10:  reinstall dapper
[04:11] <erUSUL> ortega10: System>Preferences>Themes
[04:12] <ifireball> connie_lh: so you have a mythtv.sh file right?
[04:12] <er_CHEF> how to enter a gcc in ubunto??
[04:12] <erUSUL> ortega10: clearlooks is still aviable iirc
[04:12] <ortega10> ambimom: thanks but i'm not gonna downgrade just for a visual theme
[04:12] <Arcad1> the best way is a new topic here "Do not update to edgy get the .sio"
[04:12] <Zaggynl> What's the best way to update dapper to edgy?
[04:12] <erUSUL> er_CHEF: what do you mean "enter a gcc" ??
[04:12] <Toppy> guys pls help me!
[04:12] <ambimom> zaggynl:  clean install or better still...don't
[04:12] <Toppy> guys pls help me!
[04:12] <Toppy> guys pls help me!

[04:12] <ortega10> erUSUL: but when i choose clearlooks in themes, it looks different, and the icon set is definitely different
[04:12] <ambimom> topper:  what's your problem?
[04:13] <Zaggynl> hmm
[04:13] <abes> where is NickServ?
[04:13] <erUSUL> abes: down
[04:13] <nothlit> can someone tell me what dpkg - warning: while removing gnome-commander, directory `/var/lib/scrollkeeper/index' (also TOC) not empty so not removed. means?
[04:13] <Toppy> I want to know how to enable fingerprint recognition ambimom
[04:13] <gravyface> how do you restart x from the Ubuntu shell?
[04:13] <abes> erUSUL: thanks... that's what i thought ;] 
[04:13] <ambimom> toppy:  no one has any information about that toppy...
[04:13] <martyyyr> tom47,  I did find a thread for the 4318 chipset.. do you want it?
[04:13] <erUSUL> nothlit: exactly waht it says /var/lib/scrollkeeper/index is not empty so it was not removed
[04:13] <ifireball> nothlit: it means what it says, its nothing to worry about
[04:14] <er_CHEF> i mean by terminal
[04:14] <nothlit> does that mean i need to flush the two directories?
[04:14] <nothlit> or is that a really bad thing
[04:14] <Toppy> martyyyr, talking to me?
[04:14] <martyyyr> no
[04:14] <tom47> martyyyr no not really it was not useful to my friend but this one is a more general broadcom one .... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174&highlight=broadcom
[04:14] <martyyyr> unless you want it :P
[04:15] <martyyyr> tom47: thanks
[04:15] <ifireball> nothlit: no reason to touch them, unless you're absolutly certain no other package has any file in those directories
[04:15] <CorpseFeeder> any other suggestions as to what might be making that page crash my computer?
[04:15] <CorpseFeeder> gremlins perhaps?
[04:16] <BeepAU> is ubuntu with kde installed just the same as kubuntu? kde is pretty, but i prefer ubuntu over kubuntu.
[04:16] <ambimom> CorpseFeeder:  I had same problem on edgy upgrade...
[04:16] <prompt> hello, do you know: why I can not connect to another server, then irc.ubuntu.com
[04:16] <nothlit> ifireball, i don't like error messages =/ why would scrollkeeper assume index and TOC are empty? does it flush it after scrollkeeper-update is done?
[04:16] <erUSUL> er_CHEF: what are you trying to do? compile a c file? gcc file.c
[04:16] <ambimom> CorpseFeeder:  Did you recently upgrade to Edgy or do clean install?
[04:17] <CorpseFeeder> I upgraded to Edgy
[04:17] <livingdaylight> anyone know about printing out of Inkscape
[04:17] <ambimom> CorpseFeeder:  that's your problem...you're going to have to clean install
[04:17] <livingdaylight> my printer doesn't seem to like .svg format
[04:17] <CorpseFeeder> oh.
[04:17] <Nulo> hi, would anyone help me test my dcc connection? i use xchat
[04:17] <Nulo> trying to test dcc chat and dcc send
[04:17] <geno_> I'm upgrading to Edgy Eft from Dapper(which was upgraded from Breezy :P) and when running --f install, it gives some local errors for some packages. To make sure my local "fr.CA...." is okay and it's setting it to default "C" locale. Can that cause any boot-up problems?
[04:18] <ambimom> geno: don't upgrade...do clean install...or you will have all kinds of hassles
[04:18] <ifireball> nothlit: I assume any package tries to remove all the directories it makes trusting dpkg to prevent it from breaking the system
[04:18] <er_CHEF> gcc file.c
[04:18] <geno_> too late
[04:18] <martyyyr> I'm starting to hate broadcom
[04:18] <geno_> I don't have anything to backup right now, so I'm upgrading
[04:18] <gnomefreak> geno_: no once the upgrade is done the locales will no longer error.
[04:18] <ifireball> nothlit: also, it depends on wether you purged the package or just uninstalled it
[04:18] <tom47> martyyyr getting to be a big club lol
[04:18] <jtf0518> i started hating broadcom years back and that was in Windows
[04:18] <gnomefreak> geno_: the locales are erroring because they are not set up yet
[04:18] <martyyyr> lol
[04:19] <CorpseFeeder> does this mean I will have to re-install everything? I think I'd rather just avoid that one page which crashes my computer ;)
[04:19] <geno_> gnomefreak: Thanks! I had some problems previously with it but I sudo apt-get cleaned and it -f install fine now.
[04:19] <tom47> martyyyr does ndiswrapper help?
[04:19] <ambimom> corpsefeeder:  just remove everything and re-install edgy from scratch
[04:19] <geno_> (that is so geeky :P)
[04:19] <gnomefreak> CorpseFeeder: its not edgy crashing that page.
[04:19] <nothlit> ifireball, i always purge packages, but scrollkeeper sucked all my resources and froze and i ctrl+c 'ed the middle of an installation, also, i've been compiling stuff from source
[04:19] <martyyyr> tom47, no the ndiswrapper didn't work either
[04:19] <nothlit> ifireball, but using checkinstall
[04:20] <ambimom> gnomefreak:  have you read the forums lately...edgy does not install properly for a lot of people...it's their systems
[04:20] <Ayabara> when I manually resize an mplayer window, the aspect ratio is distorted. on the manpage it says the problem could be a settin in my windows manager. anyone know how I can fix this in ubuntu/gnome?
[04:20] <CorpseFeeder> it isn't edgy crashing the page??? are you sure?
[04:20] <tom47> martyyyr ok ... i noticed in one of those thtreads a mention that prior efforts with ndiswrapper can interfere with what is outlined there
[04:20] <gnomefreak> CorpseFeeder: im willing to bet if you install konquerer and use it it will not crash on that page
[04:20] <Carl> I realize that this is a linux chat, but I was hoping that someone could help me get my windows xp working again. I'm currently in ubuntu cause windows froze while loading. It got 2 the loading screen with the loading bar and would not continue from there. I tried safe mode and useing the last known good configuration. does anyone know what the problem is?
[04:20] <nothlit> ifireball, so does that mean its safe for me to flush the directories, because the only reason a whole bunch of directories are inside it is because i halted an installation/configuration?
[04:20] <ifireball> gnomefreak: and you call yoursel gnomefreak... :P
[04:20] <martyyyr> tom47, I read that too.. but I did a complete reinstall after messing around with ndiswrapper, so it should be fine
[04:20] <anthonykid> what kind of IRC apps are there for ubuntu?
[04:21] <ambimom> gnomefreak:  just because it worked for you without problems does not mean corpsefeeder's problems aren't legitimate
[04:21] <bretzel> Hi all, that is really sad, I have Fedora Core 6 also installed since two days, and I never was able to find a solution to my wireless setup... Just as if "wireless" is totally unknown to Fedora ...sad
[04:21] <ambimom> anthonykid:  xchat
[04:21] <ifireball> nothlit: if you're 100% on that then I guess so
[04:21] <tom47> martyyr sorry i can be of no help other than a sympathetic shoulder
[04:21] <gnomefreak> ambimom: ive seen the issue
[04:21] <gnomefreak> ambimom: i already went through this
[04:21] <Zaggynl> Carl, try using a the windows cd and repair function to run a chkdsk
[04:21] <Carl> ok, I'll try that
[04:21] <martyyyr> tom47, :) it's fine, I'm starting to get used to disappointment ;)
[04:21] <CorpseFeeder> maybe it is caused by a combination of using firefox and edgy updrage version on that page which results in the crash?
[04:21] <nothlit> ifireball, the only problem i would have is if there is an installation/updating of man pages in progress, correct?
[04:22] <variant> anyone know where the gnome menu config file is
[04:22] <shwouchk> whats the default root password?
[04:22] <variant> anyone know where the gnome menu config file is? the menu editor sucks
[04:22] <tom47> martyyyr is it a laptop?
[04:22] <jtf0518> menu config to do what?
[04:22] <ambimom> ok..gotta go...cu all again...bye
[04:22] <martyyyr> tom47, yes it is
[04:22] <variant> shwouchk: there isn't  one
[04:22] <shwouchk> variant: shit man
[04:23] <ifireball> nothlit: alos if you have any othe software installed that depends upon those files
[04:23] <tom47> ok ty was just wondering seems to be a problem
[04:23] <shwouchk> variant: then what is my root password?
[04:23] <variant> shwouchk: mind your language please, why do you want the root password? run sudo -i to become root
[04:23] <variant> shwouchk: there is no root password
[04:23] <martyyyr> :)
[04:23] <jtf0518> variant, look for .gtkrc-2.0 in your home directory
[04:23] <Jowi> ubotu, tell shwouchk about root
[04:23] <variant> jtf0518: thanks
[04:23] <CorpseFeeder> anyway.. it's 1.30am so I am going to sleep and will play with this whacky computer crashing web page later.
[04:23] <geno_> shwouchk: There is no need for it. If you're set a as admin, you can become root with a command.
[04:24] <nothlit> ifireball, why would they if dpkg --configure would try to flush the directory?
[04:24] <jtf0518> you can also install the Gnome Configuration Editor from the repositories.
[04:24] <variant> jtf0518: it does not exist
[04:24] <variant> jtf0518: cool
[04:24] <jtf0518> variant, what are you trying to do? Change the menu font color?
[04:24] <bretzel> What happening to NickServ ? unable to register my passwd ...
[04:24] <variant> jtf0518: no, add custom entries in places that the menu editor will not allow
[04:25] <Dex-Freudii> hi there
[04:25] <Dex-Freudii> i have a question
[04:25] <firepol> hi, is ubuntu compatible with an amd k6-2 ?
[04:25] <shwouchk> variant, Jowi, geno_: sudo wants a password
[04:25] <Genrl_Zod>  so i just got the best mous iun the world
[04:25] <variant> shwouchk: yes, your user password
[04:25] <Genrl_Zod> highly reccommend it
[04:25] <Jowi> shwouchk, yes, your own one
[04:25] <jtf0518> ok, I'd go with the Gnome Config Editor. Are you running Edgy or Dapper.
[04:25] <shwouchk> oh
[04:25] <shwouchk> ok
[04:25] <connie_lh> ifireball: AHHH. I see where you are. The BE+FE page instead of the BE+FE+Desktop.
[04:25] <connie_lh> ifireball: AHHH. I see where you are. The BE+FE page instead of the BE+FE+Desktop. That seems simple enough to follow.
[04:26] <connie_lh> ifireball: Thanks for your help.
[04:26] <Genrl_Zod> can i just ask when u guys first ever started linux, was it as mind boggling as im interpreting it?
[04:26] <tom47> firepol the most definitive way to tell is to try an ubuntu livecd with it
[04:26] <ifireball> connie_lh: n/p good luck!
[04:26] <variant> jtf0518: I want to move the places menu to be more prominent in the single menu icon
[04:26] <Jowi> shwouchk, all the users that is in the /etc/sudoers file can do admin business with sudo. root is not needed
[04:26] <Genrl_Zod> and dowes it get easir to develop in command line
[04:26] <shwouchk> Jowi: I know what sudo is
[04:26] <shwouchk> Jowi: but root shouldn't be blocked
[04:26] <ifireball> connie_lh: if you feel like it you might wanna try get someone to update the BE+FE+Desktop page?
[04:27] <jtf0518> if you're running Dapper you can use the Alacarte Menu Editor. Should be the top choice in Accessories.
[04:27] <Jowi> shwouchk, root is not blocked. just not activated
[04:27] <variant> shwouchk: it is not blocked, sudo passwd will change the root password to whatever you desire
[04:27] <superkirbyartist> I wish to apologize for my Unubuntu behaviour yesterday.
[04:27] <jtf0518> I think they stopped using Alacarte in Edgy but my Edgy box is turned off at the moment.
[04:27] <Dex-Freudii> when downloading packages with synaptic: which directory are they stored in?
[04:27] <variant> jtf0518: i dont know what the menu editor is called..
[04:27] <jtf0518> 's cool, superkirbyartist.
[04:27] <shwouchk> variant: I know
[04:27] <superkirbyartist> It seems my Lexmark printer is paperweight.  Any suggestion on printers that work good with Ubuntu?
[04:27] <Elko> I just booted an edgy desktop cd and after X comes up and user ubuntu logs in automatically, it logs out again and starts over with the login... any ideas?
[04:28] <variant> jtf0518: at least its not smeg any more :)#
[04:28] <CharminTheMoose> what codename was/is did/does ubuntu 6.06 had/have?
[04:28] <shwouchk> variant: thanks though.
[04:28] <jtf0518> variant, are  you running Dapper or Edgy?
[04:28] <variant> jtf0518: edgy
[04:28] <shwouchk> Jowi: thanks.
[04:28] <Jowi> np shwouchk
[04:28] <ifireball> nothlit: like I said befoer, the package is probably trying to remove the dirs in any case trusting dpkg to stop it if it may damage the system, its easyer to build the packages that way rather then having them check everything
[04:28] <variant> jtf0518: thought i would give gnome a try for a change instead of fluxbox (and it's nice configurable menu system :))
[04:28] <Genrl_Zod> vairant what diod u say about win2003 anon ur box beforee
[04:28] <Genrl_Zod> i missed it
[04:28] <jtf0518> hmmm, not sure what they switched to for a menu editor in Edgy. It's Alacarte in Dapper. Anyone else here know?
[04:28] <Genrl_Zod> can u flick between a windows and unbuntu session without the need of another monitor?
[04:29] <variant> Genrl_Zod: i run it in qemu on one side of an aiglx cube
[04:29] <superkirbyartist> Also, I am looking for a dirt cheap (Pentium, 64MB RAM,...).  What Ubuntu should I use?
[04:29] <variant> Genrl_Zod: yes
[04:29] <CharminTheMoose> what codename was/is did/does ubuntu 6.06 had/have?
[04:29] <jtf0518> variant, yeah Gnome's config options are limited compared to KDE and Flux.
[04:29] <firepol> tom47: the livecd works, but with some errors. (i tried kubuntu livecd)
[04:29] <Genrl_Zod> so how do u navigate between each of the OS's?
[04:29] <dhuv> hello all
[04:29] <variant> jtf0518: indeed
[04:29] <Genrl_Zod> shortcut jkey like alt+tab
[04:29] <tom47> firepol what errors?
[04:29] <superkirbyartist> jtf0518: they still use alacarte.
[04:29] <variant> jtf0518: this is why i want to find the raw menu file
[04:29] <nothlit> ifireball, can i remove it and rebuild it with 'scrollkeeper-update' ?
[04:29] <firepol> tom47: some glitching (maybe graphic card problems i dont know, but with knoppix it works without these glitching)
[04:30] <dhuv> can anybody help with my ipw2100 problem, kubuntu says "ipw2200 eth1: failed to start the card" during bootup
[04:30] <Dex-Freudii> when downloading packages with synaptic: which directory are they stored in?
[04:30] <jtf0518> i just hacked Gnome's config manually last nite to change the font color of my menus. Now I'm trying to write an applet to do it easier than editing config files.
[04:30] <Zarephath> Greets everyone...I was looking at the prefrerences in firefox and there is an option under feeds to use live bookmarks.or others like yahoo,etc..what exactly does this do? I tried help in firefox and didn't see an explanation..
[04:30] <firepol> tom47: or i got some kde problems, well i guess i have to retry with ubuntu (instead of kubuntu)
[04:30] <DreamPlusPlus> How to  config WPA in Ubuntu?
[04:30] <tom47> firepol i would do that first (next)
[04:30] <Zarephath> ! tell DreamPlusPlus about wpa_supplicant
[04:31] <DreamPlusPlus> yes wpa_supplicant
[04:31] <ericz> Dex-Freudii, /var/cache/apt/archives/ holds a bunch of .deb's
[04:31] <ifireball> nothlit: can't help you there, I don't know scrollkeeper all that well
[04:31] <variant> Genrl_Zod: yes, i am still trying to figure out how to get qemu to not trap the alt tab when running fullscreen, but everything else works
[04:31] <Dex-Freudii> ericz, thanx
[04:31] <Zarephath> DreamPlusPlus, : Once that is installed you can go into the network settings to set it up..there should be a wireless tab as I recall
[04:32] <firepol> tom47: i will try directly to install the alternate cd
[04:32] <Zarephath> Lots of people including myself have had to use the alternate install cd....especially if you are running Mac...
[04:32] <Nanaki_Yamabushi> How how can I update the distro do edgy without downloading the new distro?
[04:33] <ifireball> !update | Nanaki_Yamabushi
[04:33] <ubotu> Nanaki_Yamabushi: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[04:33] <Zarephath> Nanaki_Yamabushi, : Well you could download the cd and install from there..it will upgrade..otherwise you are stuck with apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:33] <Genrl_Zod> how did u do it variant?
[04:33] <Genrl_Zod> vmware?
[04:33] <Genrl_Zod> i heard taht app is the best for this type of stuff
[04:33] <poulap> is it possible to mount the rest of the drive (where xp) is to show in ubuntu?
[04:34] <Genrl_Zod> i want to work in windows dfor my common tasks but at the same time when i feelik like sawitiching to linux, i d liek to do that instead rebooting every single time
[04:34] <Zarephath> ifireball, : Note he stated without downloading..I don't know of a way this is possible other than having a edgy cd do you?
[04:35] <Vuen> hey guys, how do i freeze a package so that ubuntu doesn't upgrade
[04:35] <ifireball> Zarephath: sorry, but you're wrong there, you may be better off reading the update wiki too, dist-upgrade is actually not recommanded for Edgy
[04:35] <Vuen> it?
[04:35] <COHO> Hello
[04:35] <Zarephath> Genrl_Zod, : Just download vmware server..it is free and runs windows like a bat out of hell...I think it runs better in vmware under linux than it does on its own partitions..heh
[04:35] <ifireball> Zarephath: I think he might ment not d/ling the whole CD
[04:35] <fooadd> Vuen, echo "package_name hold "  | dpkg --get-selections
[04:35] <COHO> Just loaded Ubuntu to my system. I am familiar with computers but this Ubuntu has me all confused.
[04:36] <Zarephath> ifireball, : Ahhh...well there are problems if this distro is being released and dist-upgrade is fsking up things...
[04:36] <shwouchk> how do I add init.d scripts to default runlevel?
[04:36] <jrib> COHO: a good place to start is the documentation in your help menu.  But what are you having trouble with?
[04:36] <COHO> I was reading on the formus about compiling
[04:36] <ifireball> COHO: welcome to linux, where you understand you never really knew computers...
[04:36] <poulap> hmmm
[04:36] <COHO> I typed the commands sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and nothing is there?
[04:37] <tom47> Genrl_Zod however if you have xp installed already then i would suggest that you run linux in vmware server/player inside windows until such time as you want to dispense with windows ... why?  its hugely more timeconsuming to reinstall windows than ubuntu
[04:37] <connie_lh> ifireball: I might just do that. I actually already made a wiki edit on the BE+FE+Desktop page. Trying to be all community-like. ;-)
[04:37] <jrib> COHO: what version of ubuntu are you using?
[04:37] <ifireball> Zarephath: that's not a new thing for ubuntu, dist-upgrade is rather... violent... little things like not having enough room in /var can hose your system
[04:37] <COHO> I believe it is 6.10
[04:37] <COHO> I just downloaded it
[04:37] <COHO> I installed on a fresh Harddrive
[04:37] <DreamPlusPlus> Zarephath, I can't connect to internet in ubuntu 6.10, how i can config wpasupplicant without internet connection, and now i am not on ununtu, how do i,
[04:37] <jrib> COHO: k, well try this:  gksudo "gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[04:37] <shwouchk> variant: how do I add init.d scripts to default runlevel?
[04:38] <COHO> ok
[04:38] <COHO> brbg
[04:38] <poulap> my laptop have 120 drive. 30% dictated to ubuntu. is it possible to see the rest of my drive in ubuntu?
[04:38] <shwouchk> poulap: look for parted/gparted/qtparted
[04:38] <Zarephath> ifireball, : Well I think perhaps you miss the point I am making..there are other distros that use apt-get as the package manager and AFAIK they don't see that many issues with dist-upgrade
[04:38] <variant> shwouchk: update-rc.d
[04:38] <fooadd> Vuen, http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-pkg_basics.en.html ( How do I put a package on hold?), just in case I wrote the command wrong
[04:38] <shwouchk> poulap: nm, didn't understand your question :)
[04:38] <shwouchk> poulap: you can
[04:39] <phaedrus44> i need a good ftp client with gui   ...gftp keeps freezing up
[04:39] <phaedrus44> any advice?
[04:39] <COHO> Jrib...I typed it out and got an error
[04:39] <phaedrus44> i need a good ftp client with gui   ...gftp keeps freezing up
[04:39] <COHO> says authentitcvation rejected
[04:39] <sacker> coho try the same command without the "
[04:39] <jrib> COHO: did the editor show up though?
[04:39] <fooadd> phaedrus44, filezilla (??)
[04:39] <shwouchk> variant: thanks! it's quite funny - here on gentoo its rc-update
[04:39] <COHO> Jrib ...look on top of screen
[04:39] <poulap> ok my drive is 120 gigs. 70% is ntfs for xp. 30% is for unbuntu. can i have acess to tthe partition where xp is?
[04:40] <COHO> I pmed you
[04:40] <ifireball> Zarephath: having dist-upgraded both ubuntu and debian a few times I can tell you there are ALWAYS problems, broken deps/etc. I always find myslef cealning up things after a dist-upgrade run, ubuntu just makde it a bit nicer with the upgrade tool
[04:40] <shwouchk> variant: this is (for me) one of the major annoyances of linux
[04:40] <tom47> poulap yes for reading but at this time its unwise to write to it from ubuntu
[04:40] <Zarephath> DreamPlusPlus, : I am not following you...you do have the edgy cd right? use synaptic or term and install wpa_supplicant..after this go to network settings and you should be able to search for your ssid
[04:40] <COHO> Jrib something opened up
[04:40] <jrib> COHO: you have to be registered to pm on this netword so I didn't get it, but just use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste your erros and give us a link
[04:40] <poulap> but i can read some of the files there like pdf etc?
[04:41] <COHO> not shure if it is the editor or not
[04:41] <tom47> yes
[04:41] <poulap> now how do i get acess to it
[04:41] <shwouchk> variant: packages doing the same thing shouldn't be named differently between distros (not blaming ubuntu)
[04:41] <CharminTheMoose> I have a computer that needs ndiswrapper to talk to the internet and I don't know what repositories ubuntu uses.
[04:41] <jrib> COHO: ok, how about if you type:  sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:41] <tom47> poulap which version of ubuntu are you using?
[04:41] <variant> does anyone know of a diagnostic utility i can use to test my nic for hardware problems? i am getting random link loss on multiple different networks for no apprant reason
[04:41] <CharminTheMoose> can someone direct me to them?

[04:41] <doopy> i'm following this thread on how to install the broadcom wireless: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174&highlight=wireless i don't understand how to install the driver.  it's a .o file what is that?
[04:41] <shwouchk> tom47: whats wrong with writing? it works fine
[04:41] <variant> to be specific, the link doesnt drop but all network activity is interupted for about 10 seconds
[04:41] <COHO> Jrib...I went to raink and download the file for my USB device.
[04:42] <variant> this has only happened with dapper/edgy
[04:42] <sacker> coho: Are you having problems with video? Are you stuck at a command prompt?
[04:42] <fooadd> CharminTheMoose,  http://del.icio.us/tag/ndiswrapper+ubuntu
[04:42] <COHO> THe issue is this thing does not have plug and play so unsure how to install
[04:42] <variant> I could really use some help with that
[04:42] <DreamPlusPlus> Zarephath, ok i will try it
[04:42] <COHO> Sacker...not stuck
[04:42] <MenZaLap> Is it impossible to change one's Thunderbird password if you've entered a wrong one on start? I don't see anything in my accounts.
[04:42] <poulap> tom47 am using ver 6.10
[04:42] <doopy> what is a .o file
[04:42] <Vuen> fooadd: thanks. i simply used: aptitude hold packagename
[04:42] <doopy> how do i install it
[04:43] <doopy> i think it's supposed to be a driver?
[04:43] <cached> I installed SuSE but then realized that it won't work for me so I removed it but now it kept the SuSE grub which is messed up and wont let me boot into my Windows partition anymore. How do I restore Ubuntu's grub?
[04:43] <MenZaLap> Your driver is a .inf file
[04:43] <fooadd> Vuen, you're welcome :)
[04:43] <Tokenbad> how handle img files in ubuntu...or is there a way to handle img files?
[04:43] <|mp|> anyhone knows if there is a   .deb powerDVD-linux?
[04:43] <doopy> well i'm trying to install my wireless card
[04:43] <jrib> COHO: ok so now this is a different issue?
[04:43] <doopy> and the thread shows a .o file to download
[04:43] <doopy> i don't know what to do with it
[04:43] <COHO> jrib...not different
[04:43] <fooadd> Tokenbad, just use mount -o loop
[04:44] <MenZaLap> doopy: doesn't the thread say what to do?
[04:44] <tom47> writing to ntfs i believe is still classified as "experimental" and as such i suggest folk stay away from it especially in a dual boot situaion
[04:44] <Tokenbad> ok so same as iso?
[04:44] <doopy> not really
[04:44] <COHO> was wanting to see what devices I have and how to install this USB adapter for wireless
[04:44] <fooadd> Tokenbad,  yup
[04:44] <doopy> it says use it
[04:44] <doopy> i don't know how to use it
[04:44] <cached> I installed SuSE but then realized that it won't work for me so I removed it but now it kept the SuSE grub which is messed up and wont let me boot into my Windows partition anymore. How do I restore Ubuntu's grub?
[04:44] <poulap> tom47: i will thanks lol
[04:44] <jrib> COHO: I don't think xorg.conf would be related to that.  xorg.conf has to do with your video settings
[04:44] <doopy> wait nm
[04:44] <doopy> sorry
[04:44] <COHO> I went into Add/Remove and do not understand how to install
[04:44] <fooadd> cached, just boot from the ubuntu CD, and reinstall grub
[04:44] <COHO> or do I copy everything over to a directory?
[04:45] <cached> fooadd: install cd i assume?
[04:45] <sacker> coho: What type of package you are trying to install?
[04:45] <andreuu> how do i stop the system from beeping permanantly, as I already forget the rmmod command
[04:45] <Joenin> confidential
[04:45] <andreuu> or if someone plz say again ill write it down this time
[04:45] <jrib> COHO: in ubuntu you will usually install from the ubuntu repositories.  Add/remove and synaptic are programs that list the available programs and let you install them.  To install outside the repositories (you try to avoid doing so) you won't use add/remove or synaptic
[04:45] <d0uglas> are there any good handwriting fonts that randomize anomolies so you don't have repeated letters looking the same? that's really important to me for some reason.
[04:46] <jrib> COHO: what's the model of this device?
[04:46] <COHO> Linksys WUSB54g Ver 4
[04:46] <andreuu> anyway, i just used easylinux to install nvdia drivers, and want to make sure they work

[04:47] <andreuu> and when i try ls /usr/local/games same thing
[04:47] <COHO> It says I need this driver
[04:47] <COHO> I downloaded driver

[04:48] <Zaggynl> Anyone knows how to fix the extremely slow burning speeds in Ubuntu (Dapper) ?
[04:48] <Zaggynl> UDMA is on, 32 bit too
[04:48] <Vuen> Zaggynl: slow burning speeds? that's very strange. maybe it's the burning software, try using K3B
[04:48] <Zaggynl> Vuen, tried all kinds of stuff
[04:48] <COHO> so my issue is how do I load up a driver?
[04:48] <jrib> COHO: k, I've never tried setting up wireless, but if you link me to what you are reading I may be able to help
[04:49] <geno_> Maybe try verifying the driver version or upgrading to Edgy?

[05:13] <hilsim> Hi
[05:13] <corgan> Wrong place for a question?
[05:13] <Tadej> I have eth0 and eth1, eth0 is a static IP address for internet and on eth1 I have local network. I would like to run dhcpd on eth1 for my network and I get this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31003/

[05:13] <kiff-aw> I don't see it with lspci but with pccardctl info
[05:13] <nassy> prestosd:  no it is too cheap to even have that. i bought it a long time ago though. before the 700's probably were popular.
[05:13] <jrib> corgan: you're in the right place, just ask
[05:13] <prestosd> oh
[05:14] <prestosd> nassy: then thats your problem
[05:14] <Tadej>  what do I have to do for eth0?
[05:14] <prestosd> get a 700MB

[05:17] <rooti1> cp: Verzeichnis azureus ausgelassen
[05:17] <jrib> corgan: I would backup /home and /etc, but I don't know if there is an easier way
[05:17] <ubuntudisc> corgan: you can save the /home folder and the /etc/passwd file

[05:18] <jrib> rooti1: type the exact command you are using
[05:18] <corgan> Excellent, thank you. I heard that you could copy the files...but I was worried that copying it over would cause a conflict. If /etc/passwd file works that would be great.

[05:28] <rizo> hi
[05:28] <pradeep> hello
[05:28] <munsa> I see
[05:29] <rizo> I was having problem with my ubuntu swap parttion
[05:29] <munsa> tom47 what is the apt-get for sound and video codecs?
[05:29] <nolimitsoya> rizo, what problem?
[05:29] <kenny> i want to create a partition to storage files from ubuntu , i must create "fat32" ?
[05:29] <rizo> how can i make it so that ubuntu activates the swap partiton at strt up
[05:29] <Akuma_> ifireball: even better then. both styles. funny how you don't get to see what you're missing in a Windows world eh.
[05:29] <nolimitsoya> kenny, no, you can use any filesystem you want

[05:30] <kenny> nolimitsoya: i know, but what you recommend ?
[05:30] <nolimitsoya> rizo, do you mean its not in you fstab?
[05:30] <ifireball> kenny: if its just for ubuntu, you better create an ext3 partition
[05:30] <rizo> it is but it won't work
[05:30] <kenny> i want to ubuntu and windows
[05:30] <rizo> since i resized some partitions yesterday
[05:30] <Vuen> anyone know anything about bash scripting? i'm trying to write a bash script inside a bash script. however it won't let me echo #!/bin/bash, it says command not found. anyone know why, and how i can get around it?
[05:30] <nolimitsoya> kenny, depends on your needs. id suggest xfs on lvm for scalability, or ext2/3 for windows compatibility
[05:30] <rizo> i have to manually do this
[05:30] <rizo> now
[05:31] <pradeep> rizo, did you format a partition as swap?
[05:31] <kenny> i want to windows and linux read and write on the partition, so i must create what kind of partition ?
[05:31] <ifireball> Akuma_: if you gonna just use linux for a few years you'll have the same experiance coming to windows, I can't tell how many time I tried to "ls" or "grep" in a cmd window
[05:31] <nolimitsoya> rizo, if the fstab entry referres to the uuid, change it to the partition mapping (/dev/hd*/)
[05:31] <ifireball> kenny:
[05:31] <ifireball> kenny: FAT32
[05:31] <tom47> kenny FAT32 is the most acceptable way imho as of today
[05:31] <kenny> ok
[05:31] <Vuen> kenny: vfat (fat32) is recommended, however there are good drivers for windows xp for reading and writing to ext3
[05:32] <bariel> hello, what is afpovertcp service? i see there is one running 548/tcp  open  afpovertcp
[05:32] <rizo> thats what the problem is .. i got it
[05:32] <nolimitsoya> kenny, dont use fat32. fat32 wont allow you to have bigger files than 4gb. use ext3, and a windows driver for ext
[05:32] <kenny> so, i create as "primary" partition or "extended" partition ?
[05:32] <Trixse1> What's wrong with NTFS? :(
[05:32] <Vuen> kenny: i'm dual booting ubuntu and windows xp, and i use ext3 as my shared data partition with the ext2ifs driver for windows
[05:32] <rizo> i put an hda6 instaed of hdb6
[05:32] <wildchild> is there a way to set max UL speed for just one torrent with Ktorrent

[05:32] <arjun> ubotu, staff
[05:32] <variant> i plugged in an orinoco wifi card and iwlist eth1 scan shows a bunch of wifi nets, the gnome network config tool does not show any ap's though in the drop down list for eth1 why is htis?
[05:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about staff - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:32] <kenny> nolimitsoya: is not a problem , because the partition is just 3.5gb =o
[05:32] <icelight> jion #ubuntu-cn
[05:33] <kenny> nolimitsoya: so, i create fat32 as primary ?
[05:33] <tom47> Trixsel writing NTFS is still expeerimental in linux and NOT recommended for production situations
[05:33] <Akuma_> ifireball: what i'm saying though is 'linux' seems to be a lot more flexible and well planned; so things are not only different, they're actually better. although i've been on linux for only a week.. but still
[05:33] <nolimitsoya> kenny, yes, but i stille recommend ext3

[05:33] <dhuv> can anybody help me and figure out why kubuntu cannot boot with my wireless network card in the computer? It says Failed to start card
[05:33] <kenny> nolimitsoya: thx
[05:33] <kenny> ifireball: thx too
[05:33] <Vuen> kenny: the best way to partition a drive is to make the primary partition ntfs for windows, then make an extended partition, and in it put a partition for linux, a swap partition, and a shared data (vfat or ext3) partition

[05:35] <jimb1> new to nix here...what do i use for printer drivers...or where do i find them
[05:35] <jayt> dhuv, that is the channel bot
[05:35] <jimb1> need to use a network printer

[05:35] <COHO> kk
[05:35] <Vuen> Akuma_: exactly. vista scares the crap out of me.
[05:35] <jayt> jimb1, so use system administration printing to do the work for you
[05:35] <dhuv> jayt: oh, I was wondering about the name :)
[05:35] <Vuen> Akuma_: i'm glad i got out of windows while i still good
[05:35] <ProN00b> jimb1, go system, administration, printing
[05:36] <tom47> jimb1 with any luck you wont need special drivers ....
[05:36] <Vuen> now is the best time to change to linux. i don't want to ever have to deal with vista
[05:36] <kitche> dhuv: you probably want ipw2200 since it supports ipw2100 fromw hat I remember
[05:36] <bariel> hello, what is afpovertcp service? i see there is one running 548/tcp  open  afpovertcp
[05:36] <jimb1> jayt: what do you mean use system administration printing?
[05:36] <Akuma_> Vuen: unfortunatly too many people still don't know eh. .. if only dell could come bundled with linux ... oh well
[05:36] <jimb1> totaly new to this os
[05:36] <ifireball> Akuma_: actually I'm unsure thats a good enough reason, coming to Linux just becasue you don't want windows, might not keep you on Linux long enough to really begin to enjoy it, let me warn you, there is a bumpy road ahead of you
[05:36] <dhuv> kitche: really? ok, thats fine, but the problem I am having is that kubuntu wont even boot with the card in the computer
[05:36] <jimb1> k looking for it now
[05:36] <tom47> jimb1 are you using ubuntu?
[05:36] <jayt> jimb1, so it from the menu
[05:36] <hanso> hey. my dvds flicker when run in full screen mode. what can be wrong?
[05:36] <kitche> dhuv: errors?
[05:36] <ProN00b> Vuen, you will be magically forced to use vista for some insignificant small and simple program in 2008, you will see, you can't run from it
[05:37] <Vuen> :(
[05:37] <jimb1> yea ubuntu
[05:37] <jimb1> one sec
[05:37] <dhuv> kitche: during bootup it says "ipw2100 eth1: Failed to start card"
[05:37] <dhuv> over and over again
[05:37] <ProN00b> jimb1, you klick the system button in the upper left of your screen, then administration, then printintg

[05:42] <ubuntudisc> I give up on ubuntu.
[05:42] <ubuntudisc> thanks anyway guys :-)
[05:42] <nolimitsoya> kenny, might have to change fat32 to something else, like vfat or something. mount it by hand first, to se if it complains
[05:42] <dhuv> kitche: full install
[05:42] <Vuen> ubuntudisc: :(
[05:42] <dhuv> with the new cd

[05:57] <COHO> What does this mean? uncommenting the "Universe" repository line in sources.list...does it mean just take off the "?
[05:57] <elias_> How do I add a specification page to ubuntu wiki? Is the only way to create a wiki link somewhere? If so, where would I add the link for a new specification?
[05:57] <skreet> just try to go to the page
[05:57] <skreet> and wiki will say 'do you want to make this?'
[05:57] <skreet> like /My_Page/
[05:57] <skreet> where the page would be..
[05:57] <apokryphos> COHO: the #, yes.
[05:58] <COHO> that doesn't makes sense....what do you mean the #...erase it or the "
[05:58] <skreet> COHO: A # indicated a commented line and is generally ignored by most config interpreters.
[05:58] <apokryphos> COHO: a repository in /etc/apt/sources.list is "commented out" if it has a # prefixd by it. If it doesn't, then it's not commented out.
[05:59] <COHO> so I should delete the # or everything within that area?
[05:59] <COHO> save the writing just erase the #???
[05:59] <skreet> COHO: just the #
[05:59] <COHO> kk
[05:59] <cliffd> anyone have thoughts about this, I want to mirror my boot disks, I have the nForce4 "hardware raid" on my mobo. should I use that or the linux raid (md)? thanks.
[05:59] <skreet> nForce4 isn't hardware raid.
[06:00] <jrib> COHO: if it is still not working, just give us the actual url to your post
[06:00] <psycose> is mozilla-psm in conflict with mozilla-enigmail ?
[06:00] <cliffd> skreet: yeah, it just pretends to be.
[06:00] <cliffd> so  would It just be better to use md raid?
[06:00] <skreet> cliffd: It really doesn't.
[06:00] <Vuen> ifireball: thanks
[06:00] <skreet> cliffd: It's entirely software raid.
[06:00] <COHO> Jrib I will post under owena and post the url here
[06:00] <skreet> cliffd: unless Linux support nf4's software raid, you have to use md
[06:00] <cliffd> oh really, 100%? whats the f'ing point of that then?
[06:01] <skreet> cliffd: With driver support software raid is still a huge increase in performance
[06:01] <skreet> cliffd: I know that Windows's nf4 sata-raid drivers support the software raid and provide a drastic performance boost (using them onn my windows box)
[06:01] <skreet> cliffd: never tried to use nf4-raid on linux, was always afraid of the letdown :)
[06:01] <Vuen> hi, when i call a cvs command to login to a server, it asks for a password. the password is just blank. how can i make it skip the prompt? alternatively, how can i feed it a blank line? i tried echo "" | cvs <whatever>, and it didn't work.

[06:01] <tabman> Hi everyone, I'm looking for a little help (i'm a newbie to ubuntu!)
[06:01] <COHO> Jrib there is the URL
[06:02] <cliffd> skreet: oh, this is for regular ide. I had it working in gentoo, but im trying to make the switch away from 15 hours a week spent compiling updates :)
[06:02] <skreet> cliffd: I hear you. So you had it working in gentoo? Maybe the nf4 has changed since I last tried?
[06:02] <mumbles> dont think i like the new parttioning thing
[06:03] <skreet> cliffd: How did you address the raid? Did it appear as /dev/hd*
[06:03] <tabman> I have downloaded a game for ubuntu but can not get the .sh file to run properly
[06:03] <elias_> skreet: Ok, and how do I choose the specs template?

[06:03] <skreet> tabman: what game.
[06:03] <elias_> ah, found it

[06:03] <jrib> COHO: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
[06:03] <skreet> elias_: I only know the basics of Wiki, not the ubuntu wiki, I'd suggest copying a page that has the layout you want, and using it.
[06:03] <cliffd> skreet: no it  was /dev/md/somerandomjunkC0 - C4
[06:03] <skreet> tabman: What error do you get?
[06:04] <skreet> cliffd: So you were definetely using md.. I'd go with md, it's pretty decent anyway :)
[06:04] <COHO> all one line or 2 different lines?
[06:04] <jrib> COHO: all one line is ok
[06:04] <COHO> kk\
[06:05] <COHO> nop
[06:05] <COHO> nope let me paste my error
[06:05] <psycose> it seems i can't use enigmail with mozilla on Edgy : mozilla-enigmail: Dpend: mozilla-mailnews (< 2:1.7.12.0) mais 2:1.7.13-0.2ubuntu1 devra tre install any tips ?
[06:05] <Vuen> hi, when i call a cvs command to login to a server, it asks for a password. the password is just blank. how can i make it skip the prompt? alternatively, how can i feed it a blank line? i tried echo "" | cvs <whatever>, and it didn't work.
[06:05] <jrib> COHO: ok, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org , not the forums
[06:05] <cliffd> skreet: ok, thanks. I guess i dont know quite what im talking about. thanks for setting me straight. so the next question is how do I mirror my boot disks? after the install?
[06:05] <tabman> It's not so much an error, it seems to run but then the dialogue window disappears
[06:05] <COHO> I did that the last time you asked...did you not see it?
[06:05] <skreet> cliffd: I've never actually *set up* an md before, sorry.
[06:05] <skreet> cliffd:  I've only used them after the fact :)
[06:06] <jrib> COHO: you gave me a link to the forums
[06:06] <M_Fatih> hi everybody
[06:06] <bsb001> OK, I'm still stuck on this.  I've looked in the online help.  I installed ubuntu 6.10 with a 160GB drive.  All was good.  Then I added a second 160GB drive, and used fdisk to set a partion.  However, while fdisk does report that I have a 160GB drive it will only allow me to make 1, 32 GB partion.  Any ideas?
[06:06] <tabman> I am trying to run it from the GUI, should I be trying thr terminal?

[06:07] <skreet> tabman: Are you running it from a GUI terminal, or just from like.. run application..
[06:07] <ubuntu> hi.
[06:07] <skreet> if you run it from a terminal you'll be able to see any errors that occur.

[06:21] <skreet_> variant: Whats the problem.
[06:21] <therealbigusdick> e2label ?
[06:21] <abes> skreet_: sorry... was afk... so its showing it normally in the network properties in the manager right?
[06:21] <jrib> rstanca: that's why, use 24bit and it shouldn't happen.  There was a bug somewhere on launchpad but I can't find it atm
[06:21] <skreet_> abes: Yes, sir.
[06:21] <L0NE> skreet_: "sudo apt-get mozilla-thunderbird" "E: Invalid operation mozilla-thunderbird"
[06:21] <Murp1> Does anyone know why I get logged off or no reason? I went to sleep last night, woke up this morning and I was logged off. I would expect that the computer would be locked, but not logged off. When i tried to log back in it just froze. Any ideas

[06:22] <avn_> nvidia + dell700m inspiron on edgy - is that possible?
[06:22] <skreet_> abes: Not really, why?
[06:22] <variant> skreet_: random loss of connectivity, ifconfig shows the link is still up and there are no lost packets. i tried different networks with different internet gateways and dhcp server and also different network cards even a wireless card. the issue is the same on all
[06:22] <skreet_> avn_ What card?
[06:22] <L0NE> skreet_:  sude? why not sudo? and what's the difference?
[06:22] <rstanca> jrib: ok thanks, I`ll check, brb
[06:22] <variant> anyone: random loss of connectivity, ifconfig shows the link is still up and there are no lost packets. i tried different networks with different internet gateways and dhcp server and also different network cards even a wireless card. the issue is the same on all
[06:22] <skreet_> L0NE: typo, sudo
[06:22] <skreet_> L0NE: key part is 'install'
[06:22] <abes> skreet_: just trying to compare with my case...
[06:22] <Vuen> hey guys, i'm new to bash programming, how do i write an if statement to check if a command was successful?
[06:22] <skreet_> L0NE: you wern't giving it an operation to perform on mozilla-thunderbird
[06:23] <abes> skreet_: so does wireless work at all or not?
[06:23] <dusk> sudo apt-get install mozilla-thunderbird
[06:23] <abes> skreet_: and eth1 is your wireless?
[06:23] <skreet_> abes: The wireless works 100%, i'm using it right now
[06:23] <skreet_> abes: yes, eth1
[06:23] <skreet_> variant: Sorry, not sure I can help you. :(
[06:23] <Vuen> in particular, i want to check if "sudo <something>" worked, so i can abort the script if they didn't enter the correct password
[06:23] <abes> skreet_: hmm... so what is the problem then??? :P :P
[06:23] <Vuen> how would i go about doing that?
[06:23] <Talijan> hey guys..... i'd need some help....
[06:23] <skreet_> abes: Was hoping you could tell me, lol.
[06:23] <tom47> !ask
[06:23] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:24] <abes> skreet_: lol... im confused :p
[06:24] <skreet_> abes: Me too :(
[06:24] <Talijan> i'd like to make my comp as a temporary server....
[06:24] <surface> "nautilus --oaf-activate-iid=OAFIID:Nautilus_Factory --oaf-ior-fd=21"  is wat?
[06:24] <abes> skreet_: lol
[06:24] <skreet_> Talijan: To serve what?
[06:24] <L0NE> skreet_: wow... can't believe i forgot that.. thanks, working now
[06:24] <Talijan> it means that i'd like to make it as host for web-sites and domains !
[06:24] <skreet_> L0NE: no problem
[06:24] <Talijan> can i do it without a static IP ?
[06:24] <abes> variant: so the connection is always lost using different: routers and wi-fi adapters?
[06:24] <variant> Talijan: lol, so a webserver then.. as opposed to the many other kinds of servers that there are
[06:24] <skreet_> Talijan: Yes, look into Dynamic DNS
[06:24] <Gasten> Talijan: Check www.no-ip.com.
[06:24] <skreet_> http://rgr.ath.cx/ :)
[06:25] <variant> abes: yes, ethernet cards too
[06:25] <abes> variant: ethernet? like hard wired?
[06:25] <variant> abes: i work in a datacenter and the issue is the same at home (laptop)
[06:25] <variant> abes: correct
[06:25] <tha1> what's the difference betyween the WPA key on my router and the one generated by wpa_passphrase
[06:25] <skreet_> variant: does this happen when you're using it, or when it's idle? perhaps it's going into standby? *shrug*
[06:25] <rstanca> jrib: same thing, still crashes, grrr curse you Macromedia!

[06:25] <Murp1> does anyone know how to make it so you don't log off after you are inactive?
[06:26] <variant> skreet_: well, i am always using ssh on to and from it, both disconecct as do instant messengers/downloads etc
[06:26] <abes> variant: how do you test the connectivity? what do you mean by lost?
[06:26] <abes> variant: ok nvm... got the answer
[06:26] <variant> abes: :)
[06:26] <variant> abes: any ideas?
[06:26] <skreet_> variant: anything of use in syslog?
[06:27] <variant> abes: it leaves me thinking its an ubuntu problem

[06:27] <sharperguy> can I use sound Jucer to rip to mp3? (really want a player that does vorbis)
[06:27] <abes> variant: you sure you have proper drivers for everything?
[06:27] <jrib> rstanca: try the other work-around
[06:27] <variant> abes: certain
[06:27] <skreet_> abes: different cards, too
[06:27] <abes> variant: damn... thats weird considering different cards, networks, etc
[06:27] <skreet_> abes: so drivers are an unlikely source. :(
[06:27] <variant> different cards/technologies/networks/service providers/ you name it
[06:27] <munsa> does anyone have a list of all the different repos? So you can get all the good software?
[06:27] <abes> skreet_: thats definatelly an error in the software
[06:27] <skreet_> variant: Other people on the network don't see the problem, I'm assuming.

[06:33] <rstanca> jrib: thank you! adding "export export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" will fix this issue! I'll definitely check launchpad more often
[06:33] <munsa> is there a way to download like a filedump of the ubuntu wikki so you can read it all offline?

[06:39] <yannick> Hi
[06:39] <SILVERSALMON> yes,,,it says a volume w/ software packages has been detected
[06:40] <SILVERSALMON> but no repository msg
[06:40] <SILVERSALMON> should I open with package manager?

[06:40] <munsa> thanks
[06:40] <munsa> :)
[06:40] <jrib> SILVERSALMON: I don't remember the exact message, but answer affirmatively
[06:41] <sys0p7> munsa, I've used G4L to backup my entire Ubuntu system before. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l)
[06:41] <munsa> oh cool thank you
[06:41] <munsa> it works nicely ah?

[06:43] <SILVERSALMON> ok...I am assuming it is under networking
[06:43] <SILVERSALMON> I will look
[06:43] <jrib> SILVERSALMON: you can just hit "search" as well
[06:44] <Robokop> SILVERSALMON: or just type sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils in a terminal

[06:53] <puntti> i just cant figure out what is wrong whit my system.. i just cant get 3dacceleration work

[06:54] <unikuserf> that will create 500M file
[06:54] <rickyfingers> just click on the package u want 2 install
[06:54] <SILVERSALMON> I see the file it is marked for install

[06:55] <dusk> no
[06:55] <dusk> either one or the other, it wont let you use both at the same time
[06:55] <rickyfingers> silver: nay it should b there
[06:56] <SILVERSALMON> why in the forums a person is guiding thru the terminal to install?
[06:56] <rickyfingers> terminal is the real way to do things in linux

[06:57] <Trixse1> Can I play any game with Wine? Or do I need like.. Cedega?
[06:57] <rickyfingers> get rid of windoze cuz it's nast
[06:57] <Drace> Trixse1, what game are you trying to play? any in particular?
[06:57] <Trixse1> World of Warcraft, Counter Strike
[06:57] <rickyfingers> (*looks over shoulder for fbi*)
[06:58] <overridex> Trixse1: some games work better in wine, others better in cedega...
[06:58] <overridex> i run world of warcraft in wine
[06:58] <Trixse1> ohh ok
[06:58] <Trixse1> cool
[06:58] <Drace> World of Warcraft works, I know for sure. I've got a friend running it in wine.

[06:58] <Trixse1> Who wants to pay for Cedega anyway, when Wine is free? :P
[06:58] <Drace> I don't exactly know how to do it myself, but I bet there's a guide out there somewhere.

[06:59] <rickyfingers> I've been hearing about beryl
[07:00] <rickyfingers> what is it and what does it do?
[07:00] <overridex> rickyfingers: it's an opengl accelarated window manager
[07:00] <overridex> allows lots of nifty and useful effects
[07:00] <khaije1> Trixse1: because cedega is closed/propreitary company it is able to negociate for stuff a foss project wouldn't, like non-free codecs and cd-protection (basicly drm) technologies that some games require to install
[07:00] <overridex> www.beryl-project.org  - or search youtube for some videos...
[07:00] <rickyfingers> Hmm. like an alternative to KDE or gnome?
[07:00] <elias_> I love the concept of network-manager! A daemon in the background which different GUIs in different desktop environments talk to!
[07:00] <overridex> rickyfingers: well, you still use it with gnome
[07:01] <elias_> This is how desktops should share code!

[07:01] <elias_> I wanna see more of this!
[07:01] <rickyfingers> over: but the experience is such that one feels like it's a different desktop environment?

[07:03] <Godfather> g' evening guys
[07:03] <D13GU> friends, i have one problem, with firefox
[07:03] <D13GU> The program 'firefox-bin' received an X Window System error.
[07:03] <D13GU> This probably reflects a bug in the program.
[07:03] <D13GU> The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
[07:03] <Godfather> guys i need wifi-radr.deb file
[07:03] <Bedir> Trke bilen varm
[07:03] <rickyfingers> *scratches head* still trying to grok - what's the point of using beryl...u can run windoze apps in it...more eye candy...
[07:03] <apokryphos> Bedir: English only in here please
[07:03] <krups> got a silly question, i just added a mythtv user.  but it won't let me login to kde using that user.  i think it's cause the /home/mythtv user persisted from an old installation.
[07:04] <krups> how do i correct it?
[07:04] <Godfather> could anyone tell me where i can find it
[07:04] <Bedir> Turkish system a e name is PARDUS
[07:04] <krups> beryl = pretty
[07:04] <rickyfingers> hey crups, why don't u just try copy -r
[07:04] <Bedir> UBUNTU - PARDUS
[07:04] <rickyfingers> copy -rRp
[07:04] <krups> hmm
[07:04] <khaije1> rickyfingers: it's about usability (not saying it's the best thing ever, but it is a step in a good direction)
[07:04] <rickyfingers> another user's home dir that can log in to KDE
[07:04] <Crankymonky> Anyone here ever used apt-build for a whole system?
[07:04] <overridex> rickyfingers: eyecandy, things like expose, etc.
[07:04] <apokryphos> Bedir: yes, we know Pardus exists. :)
[07:04] <overridex> true terminal transparency is handy
[07:05] <rickyfingers> *jeezum* so many things I don't know, what's expose?
[07:05] <krups> you mean cp?
[07:05] <overridex> a very nice zoom feature too
[07:05] <Bedir> I'm not understand
[07:05] <rickyfingers> yeah
[07:05] <Bedir> good??? PARDUS-UBUNTU
[07:05] <rickyfingers> Krups: sorry I went way way back to my dos roots there
[07:05] <apokryphos> Bedir: no, they're not the same at all.
[07:05] <rickyfingers> krups: yeah, cp
[07:05] <apokryphos> Bedir: join #pardus maybe
[07:05] <overridex> rickyfingers: if you touch your cursor to the upper right corner of the screen, all your windows arrange (scaled depending how many there are) on your screen so you can click one to switch to and focus it
[07:05] <SonicChao> !ext3
[07:05] <khaije1> overridex: i like zooming in and watching my other display from around the corner of the cube :-)
[07:05] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[07:06] <leafw> any ideas on how can one control firefox opening m3u files, so that they are appended to the current xmms instance instead of replacing it's playlist?
[07:06] <krups> ricky: thnx.  will try.
[07:06] <overridex> khaije1: hehe :)
[07:06] <Godfather> guys could anyone give wifi-radr.deb file
[07:06] <Bedir> thanks apokryphos
[07:06] <Bedir> good chats
[07:06] <leafw> can't find in the gconf-editor where are file associations controled
[07:06] <SILVERSALMON> ok...I thought  I just installed ndiswrapper....when I typed ndiswrapper -l it said no drivers installed???????
[07:07] <SonicChao> Godfather, is that in the repos?
[07:07] <overridex> rickyfingers: i.e. you have a lot of windows open on different desktops, you want a certain window, but don't know which desktop it's on or what window it's under... you use that, select it, it switches you to the correct desktop and brings that window to the top, and focuses it... much quicker than hunting
[07:07] <Godfather> i have a problem
[07:07] <rickyfingers> silver: u got to do ndiswrapper -i first
[07:07] <Godfather> i can't connect with linux to my wifinet
[07:07] <rickyfingers> ndiswrapper -i <your nic driver>.inf
[07:07] <SonicChao> Godfather, oh, k.
[07:07] <SILVERSALMON> ok...after that then what?
[07:07] <SonicChao> Godfather, if you could hold on, I can boot into ubuntu and help you more
[07:07] <Godfather> so i have to download .deb file by windows
[07:07] <b33r-> Is there a driver for Sound Card Creative Sound Blaster Audigy Value for ubuntu?
[07:07] <SonicChao> I'm on daul-boot -- currently in windows.
[07:07] <rickyfingers> silver: then u need to do modprobe ndiswrapper
[07:07] <Godfather> an then install it on ubuntu
[07:08] <SonicChao> yes
[07:08] <rickyfingers> silver: then, if the stars and the moons are in alignment, you'll have a driver for your wnic
[07:08] <SonicChao> I can send you the deb if you wait a few moments (10 minutes or so)
[07:08] <Godfather> ok thank you :)
[07:09] <b33r-> variant: Is there a driver for Sound Card Creative Sound Blaster Audigy Value for ubuntu? :0
[07:09] <SILVERSALMON> I typed ndiswrapper -i rt2500usb.inf and got unable to create directory'
[07:09] <SonicChao> Ok -- just installing something :)
[07:09] <rickyfingers> silver: try sudo ndiswrapper...
[07:09] <SonicChao> As soon as it's done I'll get on Linux :)
=== kevloth is now known as help

[07:11] <picasso> hi, i was curious what a good way to stream music from my laptop (ubuntu) to desktop (windows) is
[07:11] <b33r-> ok ;<
[07:11] <rickyfingers> hmmm. picasso, maybe you could just run apahce
[07:11] <rickyfingers> *apache
[07:11] <b33r-> krups:  how bout u can u help meh?
[07:12] <picasso> rickyfingers: i actually want to control it from the laptop
[07:12] <picasso> but my speakers are plugged into desktop
[07:12] <rickyfingers> picasso: let me think. the desktop is a windoze box or a linux box, same question for laptop.
[07:13] <SonicChao> hello Godfather
[07:13] <picasso> laptop is ubuntu, desktop is windows
[07:13] <SonicChao> What was the name of the package?
[07:13] <picasso> and my music source is actually a remote stream :)
[07:13] <Godfather> wifi-radr for kubuntu edgy eft
[07:13] <SonicChao> Ok.
[07:13] <rickyfingers> picasso: ok just use remote desktop to connect to desktop
[07:13] <rickyfingers> and choose the option to have remote machine play sounds
[07:13] <SonicChao> I'm on ubuntu -- and just installed (no, not a n00b, I had to reinstall) so it may take a few moments
[07:14] <SonicChao> E: Couldn't find package wifi-radr
[07:14] <krups> b33r: mine was auto detected.  what makes u think your isn't?
[07:14] <SonicChao> I believe it's in a repo I haven't yet inabled.
[07:14] <noxxle> i need a program for mounting bin/cue files because i dont want to burn them to discs. anyr ecommendations?
[07:14] <SonicChao> Possibly you could get someone else to help -- or you could wait for me to enable extra repos.
[07:15] <b33r-> krups: I'm right now on ubuntu and it didnt auto detect and the sound icon is disabled
[07:15] <khaije1> SonicChao: wifi-radar
[07:16] <SonicChao> still couldn't find package.
[07:16] <nodar> join #ubuntu-fr
[07:16] <SonicChao> It's in Multi/Universe, correct?
[07:16] <khaije1> SonicChao: didn't think so... i'm checking now
[07:16] <SonicChao> Ok.
[07:16] <SonicChao> This is a clean install, I needed to daul-boot
[07:16] <SonicChao> so whatever ubuntu has for clean install (6.06, NOT 6.06.1) is what I have.

[07:17] <rickyfingers> tienes preguntas?
[07:17] <waterpie> hi all
[07:17] <rickyfingers> you wenn tyi ma
[07:17] <rickyfingers> what's up waterpie?
[07:17] <SonicChao> khaije1: alright, I'm doing this for someone else, actually. :)
[07:18] <krups> b33r: this is clean edgy install?  and does dmesg show errors?
[07:18] <khaije1> SonicChao: it's good to help :-)
[07:18] <waterpie> rickyfingers: problems :-)
[07:19] <waterpie> i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version"
[07:19] <rickyfingers> Well, what kind of problems?
[07:19] <waterpie> rickyfingers:  i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version"
[07:19] <rickyfingers> I can get you through a lot of the straight linux stuff that you have to do at the command prompt
[07:19] <leafw> file associations in gnome, anyone? Where are they hidden?
[07:19] <rickyfingers> but I don't know a whole lot about ubunut per se
[07:19] <leafw> in kubuntu it's trivial, can't be so different!
[07:20] <SonicChao> leafw: file associatons? such as PDF open in XPDF not KPDF?
[07:20] <rickyfingers> waterpie, have u tried just installing k3b from synaptic?
[07:20] <rickyfingers> I just did that yesterday.
[07:20] <noxxle> hello? how can i mount a bin/cue without burning it to a disc
[07:20] <leafw> SonicChao: such as which apps should open which file types by default, when double-clicked
[07:20] <rickyfingers> noxxle: mount -o loop
[07:20] <waterpie> rickyfingers: it is already installed. and it works. but it gives this error
[07:20] <SonicChao> Yes
[07:21] <unikuserf> noxxle: open them with mplayer it play them without mounting
[07:21] <SonicChao> I had the same problem recently -- but I solved it. :)
[07:21] <waterpie> rickyfingers: it's k3d not k3b
[07:21] <leafw> in konqueror it's rather easy, just settings->file associations (obvious, I would say)
[07:21] <rickyfingers> watepie: my bad. I totally misunderstood your question.
[07:21] <Tonren> Guys I just updated to Edgy and I"m trying to mount a bunch of folders with unionfs, but I get this error: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on none,
[07:21] <Tonren>        missing codepage or other error
[07:21] <Tonren> Additionally, dmesg | tail produces: unionfs_read_super: error while parsing options (err = -22)
[07:21] <leafw> in gnome/nautilus there is no friggin' way to reach any such menu
[07:21] <Tonren> What's goin' on?
[07:22] <noxxle> rickyfingers i dont understand "mount -0 loop /home/noxxle/unreal.bin
[07:22] <noxxle> would that work?
[07:22] <rickyfingers> waterpie: when I get into problems with installing something with a package manager, I quit fooling with the package manager, and install from source
[07:22] <SonicChao> Yes
[07:22] <SonicChao> yes there is.
[07:22] <SonicChao> I can help you if you wish
[07:22] <rickyfingers> noxxle: u want to mount an iso image, that's on your hd?
[07:22] <bruenig> to set default apps for filetypes, just right click on the file, properties, and set the open with
[07:22] <leafw> SonicChao : sure, thanks. Not the gconf-editor, or is it ?
[07:22] <waterpie> rickyfingers: but now whatever package I try to install, it gives this error for k3d
[07:22] <noxxle> rickyfingers its a bin/cue i want to mount on my HD
[07:22] <zipzo> can anyone help me install a .sh file?
[07:23] <leafw> bruenig : ok, thanks. But that means that files that don't yet exist can't be associated yet.
[07:23] <SonicChao> no
[07:23] <kitche> zipzo: sudo sh <file>.sh
[07:23] <Vuen> whee
[07:23] <waterpie> zipzo: sh filename.sh
[07:23] <SonicChao> thats right bruenig
[07:23] <zipzo> thnx
[07:23] <SonicChao> Sorry, multi-tasking.
[07:23] <bruenig> leafw, the filetype of the file whose properties you changed will also be changed even ones you don't yet have
[07:23] <waterpie> i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version" any ideas?
[07:23] <Tonren> zipzo: Make sure that it has permission to be executed.  Do you know how to do that?
[07:23] <Vuen> does anyone here use amsn? i just wrote a script to add anti-aliasing to it, and i was wondering if anyone wanted to test it out
[07:23] <rickyfingers> noxxle: don't really see eye to eye with you on that one is the bin/cue a file, or a hardware device"
[07:23] <rickyfingers> ?
[07:23] <unikuserf>  noxxle: it has to be iso if you want to mount that
[07:24] <leafw> so, I have to download first an .m3u file, then set it to open with xmms -e %, and then, finally, open them directly from firefox links?
[07:24] <zipzo> yes, got iot
[07:24] <noxxle> how do i make a bin into an iso
[07:24] <zipzo> thnx all
[07:24] <noxxle> bin/cue is a nero iso thingy
[07:24] <bruenig> leafw, so if you change an mp3, all other mp3's on your computer and in the future will open how you changed the open with on that one mp3
[07:24] <Yeruva> <waterpie> did you upgrade from dapper?
[07:24] <waterpie> Yeruva: yes
[07:24] <leafw> bruenig : an .m3u, not an mp3
[07:24] <pecisk> anyone - how to access Ubuntu gstreamer headers from simple C app? #include <gst/gst.h> gives me error
[07:24] <bruenig> leafw, same concept
[07:24] <leafw> right
[07:24] <SonicChao> leafw: For example, we have a PDF
[07:24] <SonicChao> ok
[07:24] <rickyfingers> noxxle: ok let me think...is it a .bin that is actually just an image of a disk/partition?
[07:24] <Tonren> Can anyone help me with a unionfs problem?
[07:24] <waterpie> Yeruva: and that's when the problem started
[07:24] <leafw> but again, I need to create one such file first.
[07:25] <unikuserf> noxxie: try this. mount file.bin  /media  -o loop
[07:25] <SonicChao> so you have it working?
[07:25] <Yeruva> <waterpie> some pyton stuff was left out during upgrade.. not sure why it happened though. but it is the reason
[07:25] <noxxle> rickyfingers i dont know its a popular format for burning programs
[07:25] <SonicChao> XD 197 packages to upgrade!
[07:25] <noxxle> you load the cue up and it reads the bin
[07:25] <waterpie> Yeruva: thanks. any ideas about what exactly?
=== mcmahonm[A]  is now known as mcmahonm
[07:26] <Yeruva> <waterpie> seems they dropped support for those pacakges...
[07:26] <rickyfingers> noxxle: I don't know.  I was only ever aware of one format for a disk image, and that's iso
[07:26] <pecisk> noxxle: you can convert bin/cue using bchunk
[07:26] <pecisk> noxxle: to iso
[07:26] <rickyfingers> noxxle: so I'm thinking that .bin=.iso, but I see I'm mistaken. My bad.
[07:26] <Yeruva> <waterpie> I think removing those packges manually shouls correct the problem
[07:26] <pecisk> noxxle: just apt-get install bchunk and use it in command line
[07:26] <leafw> hum, and firefox manages it's file associations on it's own? I see that m3u files have, in their properties GUI, an association with the Movie Player, but firefox opens them with xmms anyway
[07:26] <Yeruva> <waterpie> These package names can be found when you open the update manager
[07:27] <SonicChao> leafw: that's a tricky one, firefox yes does manage things on it's own...I think it would be better to ask that though on #firefox or irc.mozilla.org/firefox
[07:27] <noxxle> im reading forums that tell me to use cdemu
[07:27] <leafw> thanks SonicChao.
[07:28] <waterpie> Yeruva: what do you mean "manually"? i try to remove k3d manually, ie: "dpkg -P k3d". or do i have to edit files?
[07:28] <SonicChao> your welcome. :D
[07:28] <rickyfingers> noxxle, I mean, if you have the disk available
[07:28] <noxxle> i do, but cdemu isnt in the repos
[07:28] <noxxle> wtf
[07:28] <rickyfingers> just do dd if=/dev/yourcdrom of=whateveryouwanttocalltheiso

[07:28] <Yeruva> <waterpie> Can you around 25+ pacakes not upgraded and grayed out in update manager??
[07:28] <rickyfingers> that'll make a blind copy of the disk for you.

[07:29] <pecisk> Slim^snief^schu: which software installation?
[07:29] <SonicChao> Slim^snief^schu: During? Like right in the middle of software installation?
[07:29] <bruenig> Slim^snief^schu, what do you mean reboots during software installation, if you are talking about it telling you to reboot after uprading the kernel, then that is normal, other than that probably not

[07:38] <kitche> fgeller: then it accepted your resolutions but which resolution is first?
[07:38] <kcfelix> i'm googling about this for some weeks :(
[07:38] <rickyfingers> obi did you try ndiswrapper?
[07:38] <usamahashimi> why dapper live cd can not enter into rescue mode while typing rescue and hitting enter?
[07:38] <fgeller> kitche: was looking for something about monitor or screen section
[07:38] <jimb1> any idea whats goin on here...got this message     Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[07:38] <gnomefreak> larsemil: none are 4.0 can you please give me link to cedega
[07:38] <rickyfingers> 'cuz I got a broadcom sometheing working with that.
[07:38] <kitche> fgeller: the Xorg.0.log is a bit crypted you have to look for (EE)

[07:39] <rickyfingers> obi: ok do a google for like sourceforge ndiswrapper list
[07:39] <fgeller> kitche: there are some EE entries, but about a /dev/wacom device
[07:39] <auhsoj> bruenig, there is at least an 0.40
[07:39] <kcfelix> the module is snd_hda_intel and, on the first boot, when it works, the alsa mixer lists it as ATI HDA SB
[07:39] <bruenig> auhsoj, yeah sorry didn't read further down http://www.ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=14269&d=1155524787
[07:39] <auhsoj> adm, but is that the latest? because there are multiple threads like that
[07:39] <Osires> I've just just got a quick question: linux-generic installs what version of the kernel 386, 686, K7 .. because it looks like the 386 version which isn't very optimised for AMDs. Is there any way to install the k7 version (as I see its now depricated)
[07:39] <rickyfingers> obi: do lspci or...friggen...cardctl info
[07:40] <bsb001> Well I'm still at it.  I installed ubuntu, then added another drive.  I have used fdisk, cfdisk and others to set up the drive. But it refuses to mount (giving the error "Unable to mount the selected volume. The volume is probably in a format that cannot be mounted."  I've tried using mkfs, but this does not seem to help.  Any ideas?
[07:40] <b33r-> where from do I get a source list? -.-
[07:40] <gnomefreak> larsemil: when does it state it needs xlibs-4.0?
[07:40] <adm> auhsoj, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=14269&d=1155524787 (that version is 0.41-1, i use it)
[07:40] <kcfelix> anybody got this sound card working?
[07:40] <auhsoj> thx adm
[07:40] <adm> >_>
[07:40] <larsemil> gnomefreak, well it says when i try to install it.it says it is not installed...
[07:40] <gnomefreak> larsemil: xlibs are normally versioned with Xorg
[07:41] <adm> the second version was a direct download link, actually ;)

[07:43] <Xal> I'm trying to make a DVD with multiple OSes on it. ISOLinuxis an option for booting linux from the CD. I just can't figure out how to use it.
[07:43] <rickyfingers> raffo: r u using some kind of isa sound card or something?
[07:43] <Osires> Anybody? linux-generic is 386, 686 or K7? (I'm guessing its 386) and if it is how do I get an optimised kernel as I'm doing some coding were the kernel version makes a big difference
[07:43] <Xal> I can't get the disk to boot all the way.
[07:43] <Xal> It simply stops.
[07:43] <RaffoPazzo> no i have an ac97 sound card
[07:43] <adm> auhsoj, ubuntu control panel is a separate app
[07:43] <roryy> Osires: i suspect you'll need to compile your own
[07:44] <RaffoPazzo> alsaconf detect it correctly
[07:44] <Paddy_EIRE> how to get the "checkgmail" notifier to start when logging in to ubuntu.... I've already tried by adding it to "System > Preferences > Sessions" then start up apps
[07:44] <roryy> Osires: what sort of coding are you doing?
[07:44] <gnomefreak> larsemil: are you sure it says xlibs? i see XFree 86 4.0 or higher
[07:44] <Kim^J> Are there any media center like Windows media center in Ubuntu?
[07:44] <auhsoj> adm ah ok
[07:44] <b33r-> gnomefreak:  is it the same for edgy and dapper?
[07:44] <usamahashimi> when i plugin my usb disk, its not mounting automatically?
[07:44] <Osires> roryy: Graphics research
[07:44] <gnomefreak> larsemil: glibc 2.2 or higher
[07:44] <Kim^J> usamahashimi: Mount it manually then?
[07:44] <bsb001> Well I'm still at it.  I installed ubuntu, then added another drive.  I have used fdisk, cfdisk and others to set up the drive. But it refuses to mount (giving the error "Unable to mount the selected volume. The volume is probably in a format that cannot be mounted."  I've tried using mkfs, but this does not seem to help.  Any ideas for this noob?
[07:44] <SonicChao> Kim^J: What do you mean 'like'?

[07:44] <TLE> Hey everybody. Doea any of you have any idea when EasyUbuntu will be updated for Edgy
[07:44] <Osires> rorry: Ubuntu used to be fine in 6.06 cause I could install the k7 kernel *sigh* Thats stupid gonna have to go back a version
[07:44] <gnomefreak> b33r-: yes
[07:44] <RaffoPazzo> when i include all sound modules needed, i can hear the power-up sound of the speaker....
[07:44] <kitche> !easyubuntu > TLE
[07:45] <usamahashimi> Kim^J: can u guide me?
[07:45] <gnomefreak> TLE: ask in #easyubuntu
[07:45] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Have you tried WMC ?
[07:45] <RaffoPazzo> but i can't here any sound
[07:45] <kitche> TLE well it's not even part of ubuntu it's 3rd party
[07:45] <SonicChao> Kim^J: yes, lol, I dual-boot.
[07:45] <larsemil> gnomefreak, thanks alot
[07:45] <Flannel> Osires: in dapper, there -generic kernel is optimised for all arches
[07:45] <RaffoPazzo> mplayer and gaim don't sound
[07:45] <Kim^J> usamahashimi: sudo mount /dev/ /where
[07:45] <denver> is anyone aware of a good guide to setting up xgl and compiz on ubuntu or should i just find a forum topic about it and have at it?
[07:45] <roryy> Osires: *shrug* my understanding is after some testing little difference was found between the versions
[07:45] <Flannel> denver: #ubuntu-xgl
[07:45] <gnomefreak> larsemil: <hint> debian has a version if i read correctly
[07:45] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Yes... Is there a program like that to Ubuntu or Linux
[07:45] <denver> thank you flannel
[07:45] <Kim^J> ?
[07:45] <Osires> roryy: Depends what your doing there
[07:45] <roryy> Osires: you can still compile *your* code to use whatever magic instructions you want
[07:45] <TLE> kitche: thanks but the info is not there
[07:45] <usamahashimi> Kim^J: how can i find the device for usb-drive?
[07:45] <larsemil> gnomefreak, and how do i get the hand on this?
[07:45] <TLE> gnomefreak: will do
[07:46] <Kim^J> usamahashimi: I dunno.
[07:46] <usamahashimi> Kim^J:  i mean in dev
[07:46] <SonicChao> Kim^J: I don't know about exactly the same, but Totem I think is close.
[07:46] <Osires> roryy: Any gentoo person will GREATLY disagree with you there ;-)
[07:46] <kitche> TLE: it should have pointed you to join #easyubuntu
[07:46] <roryy> Osires: *shrug*
[07:46] <Osires> roryy: Ya hopefully the kernel won't have such a big impact on that .. I'm hoping
[07:46] <RaffoPazzo> usamahashimi: have you already executed lspci?
[07:46] <Osires> Flannel: You can't have optimisations for all arches at the same time .. not possible
[07:46] <RaffoPazzo> it should detect usb device
[07:46] <TLE> kitche: I know, but i figured that perhaps somebody here knew anyway :: Yeah it did thanks
[07:46] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Hmm... Like Geekbox or what they call it... A controlpanel or what it's called. When you start that media center program in WMCE.
[07:47] <SonicChao> Kim^J: Geekbox? control panel? ... you've got the wrong guy
[07:47] <Osires> rorry: I know their gonna lose a lot of academic users because of that one (at least the guys that need performance) *shrug* I guess that is the price of going generic
[07:47] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Ok.
[07:47] <bsb001> I have a noob question on adding a hd - will anyone help with this?
[07:47] <gnomefreak> larsemil: i dont see any package in any of the depends directly related to xlibs unless you mean xlibmesa and i think name of that changed a while ago
[07:48] <Konnektion> bsb001 what kinda problems are you having?
[07:48] <Pelo> bsb001,  aks the question
[07:48] <rickyfingers> bsb: yeah what's your problem?
[07:48] <bsb001>  I installed ubuntu, then added another drive.  I have used fdisk, cfdisk and others to set up the drive. But it refuses to mount (giving the error "Unable to mount the selected volume. The volume is probably in a format that cannot be mounted."  I've tried using mkfs, but this does not seem to help.  Any ideas?
[07:48] <gnomefreak> larsemil: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cedega  try this way
[07:48] <rickyfingers> ok bsb: here's what u gotta do
[07:48] <larsemil> gnomefreak, well i just ask what cedega says while dpkg -i ing
[07:48] <D13GU> hello how to install flash player on firefox?
[07:48] <rickyfingers> bsb: do you know for sure what node the drive's getting mounted on?
[07:49] <SonicChao> What is Edgy's scheduled release date?
[07:49] <Osires> Anyway thanks for the help roryy
[07:49] <nolimitsoya> Osires, if you are referring to the new kernel, it has al the capabilities of the old special ones, but as modules that get loaded when the need arise
[07:49] <RaffoPazzo> so
[07:49] <kitche> SonicChao: umm it's been out for a while now
[07:49] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Edgy is released.
[07:49] <roryy> np
[07:49] <SonicChao> kitche: Out? so this update is installing edgy?
[07:49] <rickyfingers> bsb: what kind of a drive is it? is it a usb external, or internal ide, or sata?
[07:49] <waterpie> bsb001: i don't know how to help you, but why don't you show the exact commands you used to create the fs, and then to mount them?
[07:49] <bsb001> rickeyfingers:  you mean as in   /dev/hdb1   ?
[07:49] <SonicChao> I just installed dapper, actually.
[07:49] <Kim^J> SonicChao: It's been out for like three weeks.
[07:49] <SonicChao> Well, i used it for a while, reinstall problems
[07:49] <Flannel> Osires: yes, it loads the optimizations at runtime, hense, only one kernel
[07:49] <kitche> SonicChao: it got released at the end of October
[07:49] <bsb001> it's a internal - 160GB
[07:49] <SonicChao> ok, so updating with synaptic is installing edgy?
[07:49] <RaffoPazzo> have anybody any ideas to help me?
[07:50] <larsemil> gnomefreak, and this guide was kind of only saying that all i need to do is dpkg -i it
[07:50] <Kim^J> SonicChao: No.
[07:50] <rickyfingers> so it's an ide?
[07:50] <gnomefreak> larsemil: i would try asking in #cedega
[07:50] <MetaMorfoziS> what is i2c and i20 devices?
[07:50] <SonicChao> then what is, Kim^J?
[07:50] <novaterata> If I have an athlon xp should i be using the i386 kernel image or the genereic image in Edgy
[07:50] <nolimitsoya> generic
[07:50] <Osires> Ahh lovely .. thank you :-D
[07:50] <nolimitsoya> always generic
[07:50] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: generic
[07:50] <Kim^J> SonicChao: Just updates prolly.
[07:50] <Osires> thats what I was hoping for
[07:50] <kcfelix> ok, I've read the DebuggingSoundProblems wiki and I can't solve my problem? :(
[07:50] <larsemil> gnomefreak, well i dit but they are sleeping
[07:50] <larsemil> :)
[07:50] <larsemil> thx anyway
[07:50] <Osires> THanks nolimitsoya
[07:50] <ajopaul_> DI3GU, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[07:50] <novaterata> oh, the installer choose i386
[07:50] <kcfelix> would anybody hear it and try to help
[07:50] <rickyfingers> bsb: I im'd you answer...
[07:50] <Osires> Cya
[07:50] <SonicChao> Then software update is installing it?
[07:50] <bsb001> I missed you message - yes it's an ide
[07:50] <SonicChao> Because that's what I chose.
[07:51] <novaterata> So I should install generic and use that then
[07:51] <kcfelix> I've gathered plenty of info about it
[07:51] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: final release installer should have installed the generic by default
[07:51] <kcfelix> some weeks on google...
[07:51] <rickyfingers> bsb: the chanel's too busy now, answer my PM 2 u
[07:51] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, are you sure you are talking to the right person?
[07:51] <novaterata> is this another upgrade from dapper thing
[07:51] <gnomefreak> novaterata:
[07:51] <kcfelix> but I don't know exactly what to do with it
[07:51] <SonicChao> Oh, its updating ubuntu-base and ubuntu-docs
[07:51] <kcfelix> it's an alsa problem
[07:51] <RaffoPazzo> kcfelix: have you got a sound problem, too ?
[07:51] <SonicChao> This must be a new release
[07:51] <gnomefreak> sorry nolimitsoya  it was auto completion
[07:51] <kcfelix> yeah
[07:52] <gnomefreak> novaterata: ok yes install the generic. upgrade only keeps your version of kernel used
[07:52] <nolimitsoya> gnomefreak, perhapslook into tab completion instad off comma completion?
[07:53] <waterpie> i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version" any ideas?
[07:53] <macsim> I got a problem with a ati driver installation
[07:53] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: yeah
[07:53] <larsemil> gnomefreak, this should do it not: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/x/xorg/xlibs_6.8.2-77_all.deb
[07:53] <gnomefreak> nolimitsoya: auto completion is tab completion dont have a clue what you mean by off comma
[07:53] <NemesisUK> is the update from dapper to edgy safe?
[07:53] <gnomefreak> larsemil: what version of ubuntu?
[07:53] <macsim> the X server seams to start with fglrx, fglrx is loaded, but no 3d acceleration :/
[07:53] <SonicChao> NemesisUK: I'll know in a few moments
[07:53] <SonicChao> I'm updating lol
[07:53] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: I found it a bit weird
[07:54] <waterpie> NemesisUK: i have done it, and there are problems
[07:54] <rickyfingers> NameisUK: here's what I do regarding upgrades:
[07:54] <larsemil> gnomefreak, edgy
[07:54] <kitche> NemesisUK: according tot he website it safe to upgrade if you don't use gksudo update-manager -c

[07:55] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: 'cause when I'm install ubuntu, everything works fine, then, on my first system reboot, alsa is gone. Just oss works and alsamixer wil give me a 'alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument' msg
[07:55] <dudanogueira> nolimitsoya, how can i repair the damages?
[07:55] <nolimitsoya> dudanogueira, unplug them and get yourself a proper pair of headphones

[07:56] <dudanogueira> nolimitsoya, i unnplugged yesterday, since it didnt worked. but now, the system sounds doesnt work :(
[07:56] <oliver_> hi, can i get good help on getting edgy to work on a Athlon 64 X2 5000, (installed is 386, running at 1000MHz)
[07:56] <zi99y> lo all
[07:56] <waterpie> btw, what does "preconfigure" a package mean? in contrast to installing it?
[07:56] <dudanogueira> is there a way to reconfigure the sound settings?
[07:56] <kcfelix> RaffoPazz1: what do you mean? on my first boot, i can choose between alsa and oss
[07:56] <bsb001> rickeyfingers: I am so damn new here - I don't see any IM to respond to.  I have tried to send you an IM - did you see it?
[07:57] <zi99y> anyone know of a prozilla deb for edgy?
[07:57] <RaffoPazz1> yes but they cannot work together
[07:57] <zi99y> or similar downloader app
[07:57] <rickyfingers> chantilli: sounds like u are in for some coding check out http://www.ctv.es/pckits/tpserie.html
[07:57] <kcfelix> RaffoPazz1: yes, yes. but what happens is that after reboot I can't choose alsa anymore
[07:57] <adm> zi99y, isn't it in universe?
[07:58] <zi99y> adm, not in my universe.... I'll check
[07:58] <kcfelix> RaffoPazz1: volume control just won't show alsa as an possible device anymore
[07:58] <MrKeuner> hi, I installed edgy on 26th of October, since then I got only 2 security updates. No other updates. is that normal?

[07:59] <cliffd> how in the hell do I get the software raid for my boot disk working from the install? after it installs it just sits there like it has no /boot ?
[07:59] <adm> weird..
[07:59] <kcfelix> RaffoPazz1: I googled for the error message and find someone with a very similar problem in this page: http://chamine.ru/sha/linux/aspire5112_gentoo.html

[08:00] <kcfelix> he is using gentoo on an acer laptop, so it seems it's an alsa problem and not a ubuntu one
[08:00] <kkin> hello, people! hp dv9008 (pavillion) AMD64 x2 nVidia.  sound works on live x86 cd, not with AMD 64 or installed (either).  currently have edgy installed & trying to use easyubntu, but that fails with "IOError: [Errno 2]  No such file or directory: './packagelist-edgy.xml'"  I'm thinking that my best bet is add PLF to repositories???

[08:01] <adm> zi99y, or... http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/prozilla/prozilla_1.3.7.4-1_i386.deb is newer >_> and... no problem
[08:01] <shwouchk> for some reason I can't start the ssh server - I have ubuntu server installed as lamp.. what could cause this?
=== yeager_ is now known as yeager
[08:01] <RaffoPazzo> kcfelix: sorry but my connection in the evening is very very instable
[08:01] <zi99y> adm, much appreciated :)
[08:01] <RaffoPazzo> i said you that oss and alsa cannot work together
[08:01] <rickyfingers> kkin: I had to update bios in order for install of edgy 64 to work
[08:01] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: don't worry
[08:01] <Ulixes> hello
[08:02] <bsb001> rickyfingers:  I have sent you 2 Im's,  have you not gotten them?
[08:02] <rickyfingers> bsb: no
[08:02] <Ulixes> if i've another hard disk in fat 32 how can i format it to use with ubuntu?
[08:02] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: yeah, I know. I said that volume control won't let me choose alsa device after my first reboot
[08:02] <MrKeuner> nixternal: OK
[08:02] <nixternal> didn't see you
[08:02] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, you dont have to reformat it
[08:02] <nolimitsoya> just mount it
[08:02] <nixternal> MrKeuner: there haven't been many updates since edgy release
[08:03] <Ulixes> how?
[08:03] <rickyfingers> bsb: u should just be able to click my handle and so on
[08:03] <kkin> hoo boy.  tx, rickyfingers.  unfortunately I don't see an udate for this one yet.  ty, beer.
[08:03] <Ulixes> can you  explain me about mounting e smounting
[08:03] <nixternal> however, if you were to go into /etc/apt/source.list and look, you probably have a lot of the sources # commented out
[08:03] <Ulixes> i'm new in linux
[08:03] <MrKeuner> nixternal: in terms of procejt updates? or repackkaging updates?
[08:03] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, sudo mount /dev/<harddrive-deisgnation> -t vfat /<folder-you-want-to-mount-in>
[08:03] <RaffoPazzo> so if i undestanded, you try to execute alsamixer, and this fails
[08:03] <Spliffster> is there an equivalent to debian's base-config in ubuntu 6.10 ?
[08:03] <RaffoPazzo> right?
[08:03] <dudanogueira> Ulixes, be welcome :)
[08:03] <Ulixes> :D
[08:03] <nixternal> you could go through and uncomment, remove, the # from lines that start     deb http://
[08:03] <bsb001> Rickeyfingers:  I highlight your name in the people in room list.  It takes me to a new window, with your name at the top.  I type, but you don't get it - damn that is strange
[08:03] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: some guy with a similar problem found a workaround: removing /etc/asound.state and then alsaconf again
[08:03] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: but i couldn't find /etc/asound.state :(
[08:04] <chilli> Ulixes: yeah, welcome dude

[08:04] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, sudo apt-get install gparted && sudo gparted
[08:04] <RaffoPazzo> and alsamixer failed me too
[08:04] <Spliffster> what is debian's `base-config`on an edgy server ?
[08:04] <b33r-> gnomefreak:  okay thanks :)
[08:04] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: same error? invalid argument?
[08:05] <RaffoPazzo> but my problem was that no sound module was included?
[08:05] <RaffoPazzo> !!
[08:05] <rickyfingers> bsb: 'f u know much about mirc, may b you can steer me in the right direction.
[08:05] <RaffoPazzo> *not ? but !!
[08:05] <cliffd> anyone have a guide or know how to setup mirrored boot drives during the install. Im stuck. I think im doing it right but it wont boot after the fact. grub wont come up..

[08:05] <Pelo> Ulixes,  ths will be helpfull to you http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84
[08:05] <dudanogueira> I inserted a plantronics headset yesterday, and sice them, the system sounds doesnt work. does anyone knows how to reconfigure the sound cards?
[08:05] <Jimbo> how do i run an exe file ?
[08:05] <rickyfingers> Jimbo...rdp is your friend
[08:05] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: my sound module *seems* to be loaded, it's snd_hda_intel
[08:05] <Ulixes> how can i use it to stock files
[08:05] <Ulixes> ?
[08:05] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, if you want to reformat you will have to unmount first
[08:05] <dudanogueira> Jimbo, try run it with wine
[08:05] <Jimbo> rdp????
[08:05] <Ulixes> k
[08:05] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: but it just don't works :'(
[08:05] <RaffoPazzo> me too
[08:06] <Jimbo> where is wine or rdp?
[08:06] <RaffoPazzo> :(
[08:06] <tdn> How do I reinstall GRUB? I need to do this because I get error 17 when GRUB tries to start.
[08:06] <rickyfingers> Jimbo: use terminal server client
[08:06] <RaffoPazzo> have you included by you the module into kernel?
[08:06] <rickyfingers> then do whatever u want in windows, and sftp/ssh it over
[08:06] <Jimbo> ricky: what do i do in the terminal?
[08:06] <RaffoPazzo> i'm stiil here...it was my ghost....:D
[08:06] <zi99y> adm, I have this line in my sources.list and it doesn't find prozilla? deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main restricted universe
[08:06] <Spliffster> Jimbo: windows executables are not supported by any other platform than windows. however there is an windows api emulation layer called wine. it is still work in progress and much compatible with windows 2000. you can instal it with "#  apt-get install wine" and give it a try
[08:07] <rickyfingers> Jimbo: wine is usually under ineternet under applications
[08:07] <tdn> I have treied to boot from the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS cd and then mount my root fs and chroot into it and then run apt-get install --reinstall grub, but that does not fix the problem.
[08:07] <Jimbo> k ill look there
[08:07] <GaiaX11> tdn: you can use the ubuntu alternate cd to do that.
[08:07] <gnomefreak> b33r-: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31032/
[08:07] <zi99y> adm do I have to add pool somewhere?
[08:07] <b33r-> gnomefreak:  tyvm
[08:07] <gnomefreak> b33r-: that is a full list
[08:07] <Spliffster> cany anyone help me ?
[08:07] <RaffoPazzo> on what?
[08:07] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: not this time. I tried before with module-assistant but then Dapper won't boot anymore. It interruped the initing to display that invalid argument error forever
[08:07] <Trixse1> How do I kill a process?
[08:07] <tdn> GaiaX11, why can't I do it from the official cd? I do not have any blank cds :(
[08:07] <rickyfingers> "spliffster, what's your prob?
[08:08] <Spliffster> i am looking for something like base-config (on debian) in ubuntu
[08:08] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: I had to reinstall it, it was a pain :(
[08:08] <Jimbo> brb
[08:08] <adm> zi99y, it could simply not be in edgy repos
[08:08] <GaiaX11> tdn: use the rescue mode in the alternate cd.
[08:08] <Smurf`> why when i try ./configure the system said checking for gcc... gcc
[08:08] <Smurf`> checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
[08:08] <Smurf`> configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot create executables.
[08:08] <Smurf`> 
[08:08] <Smurf`> ?
[08:08] <rickyfingers> can't help u there...when u really start having problems with the package manager, it's time to go gentoo
[08:08] <Trixse1> How do I kill a running process in Ubuntu?
[08:08] <tomek_> hi there, do you know some program like radmin for Ubuntu for remote desktop control on Windows? 10x in advance
[08:08] <zi99y> ok thanks adm
[08:08] <RaffoPazzo> well, i had to re-install all the kernel for an incredible skge module problem
[08:08] <kkin> Pelo: great url!
[08:08] <Spliffster> rickyfingers: is there a utility (wizard) to configure the base system on a server (no xwindows) ?
[08:08] <rickyfingers> trix: kill -s 9 pid
[08:08] <gnomefreak> adm: prozilla is not in the repos
[08:09] <nolimitsoya> tomek_, ssh or vnc
[08:09] <tdn> GaiaX11, but I do not have the alternate cd. Whats on the alternate that can do this but not on the official?
[08:09] <Trixse1> rickyfingers: 9 is the id?
[08:09] <kcfelix> Trixse1: i always do "ps -A | grep <program name>" to find the id and then "kill -s kill pid"
[08:09] <Pelo> kkin,  I take no credit,  I got if rom digg
[08:09] <RaffoPazzo> kcfelix: what's you lsmod output?
[08:09] <rickyfingers> spliff: I think you are talking about just doing the server install
[08:09] <nblracer> how can i get a list of user and group, and what program is being used by a certin user?
[08:09] <zi99y> cheers all ;)
[08:09] <adm> gnomefreak, i know :)
[08:09] <Spliffster> tomek_: "Terminal Server Client" should be installed b default
[08:09] <rickyfingers> spliff: i did it yesterday, and it didn't come with no doggone window manager
[08:09] <tdn> nblracer, with the ps program.
[08:09] <RaffoPazzo> nblracer: with "who" you can see all the users logged in
[08:09] <rickyfingers> spliff: hence I did the desktop install shortly thereafter
[08:09] <Spliffster> rickyfingers: nae i am talking about afterboot installation
[08:09] <GaiaX11> tdn: I think it is because in the alternate we have the option to install in text mode
[08:10] <Jimbo> installing wine
[08:10] <nblracer> whats is PS tdn
[08:10] <kkin> tx, all.  Asta.
[08:10] <tomek_> nolimitsoya, maybe it should be installed on he win machine?
[08:10] <GaiaX11> tdn: And in the official we don't
[08:10] <RaffoPazzo> for the complete lists of usrs and groups you have to find the file in which "useradd" save its info...
[08:10] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: it's long, I wouldn't paste it in here :)
[08:10] <Ulixes> so
[08:10] <Spliffster> Jimbo: good luck. make sure to check the website. the wine hq website has an extensive list of compatible binaries
[08:10] <RaffoPazzo> not the entire
[08:10] <omV0> I just installed a fresh copy of Edgy but when i try to view a .avi or .mp3 file with either totem or mplayer i get errors..
[08:10] <GaiaX11> tdn: I don't like the official cd either.
[08:10] <Ulixes> after i mount it how can i access to the secondary hd
[08:10] <Ulixes> ?
[08:10] <RaffoPazzo> just the module you need
[08:10] <kcfelix> ok
[08:10] <rickyfingers> Raffo, just do sudo cat /etc/passwd
[08:10] <RaffoPazzo> lsmod | grep snd
[08:10] <lucien> how do u install perl?
[08:11] <tdn> GaiaX11, well... What do you want me to do from the text mode? Why does chrooting me into my root fs and then doing an apt-get install --reinstall grub not help?
[08:11] <rickyfingers> that's got all the user's on the sys.
[08:11] <kcfelix> snd_hda_intel          20116  2
[08:11] <RaffoPazzo> ok
[08:11] <RaffoPazzo> try this
[08:11] <Pelo> lucien,   package from synaptic
[08:11] <Jimbo> Spliffster: whats the website?
[08:11] <RaffoPazzo> remove module from kernel
[08:11] <Spliffster> Jimbo: also ... if you want the latest and greatest version add the wine hq sources to your /etc/apt/sources.list. the urls are mentioned somewhere on the wine hq site
[08:11] <omV0> mplayer says "Error opening/initilizing the selected video_out (-vo) device."
[08:11] <lucien> yeh but i cant manage to install
[08:11] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: i've tried grep snd, but it's long too
[08:11] <RaffoPazzo> and then reinsert it again
[08:11] <Spliffster> Jimbo: google.com/search?wine+hq
[08:11] <RaffoPazzo> ok
[08:11] <lucien> where do i place the files in /tmp?
[08:11] <Jimbo> k
[08:11] <Spliffster> Jimbo: google is your friend
[08:12] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: rmmod and modprobe?
[08:12] <RaffoPazzo> yes
[08:12] <RaffoPazzo> but
[08:12] <tdn> nblracer, ps is a program that is used to list running processes. Type "man ps" to learn more about it. Another quick way to see which processes a specified user is running is by using "top". Just write "top" i a console, and then when it starts up you press "u" followed by the user's username.
[08:12] <RaffoPazzo> i had a problem on the module
[08:12] <Jimbo> Spliffster: wine is apparently installed but i dont see it in the applications or system menu
[08:12] <Spliffster> hey room: is there a ncurses utility for configuring the base ubuntu system ? much like it is done on debian with base-config ?
[08:12] <sven> hello what's the command from ubuntu to update GRUB? as in .. i've got a new kernel in slackware and i would like to make a new entry in GRUB. ubuntu seems to do that automatically. what is the command? thanks
[08:12] <tomek_> nolimitsoya, spliffster: 10x a lot, I'll try
[08:12] <Jimbo> im new to nix in case u didnt figure that out
[08:13] <RaffoPazzo> alsamixer don't found any sound device
[08:13] <Spliffster> Jimbo: search it with "alacarte" the menu editor and activate it
[08:13] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: well, this is weird: ERROR: Module snd_hda_intel is in use
[08:13] <Random_Transit> hey, does anyone know when shipit will be offering edgy cds?
[08:13] <dcordes> i dunno you can buy them
[08:13] <Flannel> Random_Transit: I don't believe they will be
[08:13] <GaiaX11> tdn: I don't have experience reinstalling grub with the official cd. And I am not sure if it has the rescue option. What i can say to you is that with the alternate it works. But with the official I do not know for sure.
[08:13] <kitche> Random_Transit: probably never since dapper is LTS
[08:13] <Random_Transit> well that sucks.
[08:13] <gnomefreak> sven: sudo update-grub
[08:13] <dcordes> Flannel: why do you think so?
[08:13] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: maybe some app is misusing the module? (noob guess)
[08:13] <Spliffster> base-config on ubuntu ... anyone ?
[08:13] <RaffoPazzo> try "rm -fr all_my_ghost_logged_in"
[08:13] <RaffoPazzo> :D
[08:14] <sven> gnomefreak, really that simple?
[08:14] <Jimbo> Spliffster: where is this alacart thing? just installed linux yesterday frst time
[08:14] <gnomefreak> sven: if you try to run that in gentoo it might not work. not sure how they have it set up
[08:14] <Random_Transit> so since dapper is LTS, does that mean there'll be more backports of things like firefox 2.0?
[08:14] <dcordes> kitche: i think LTS is a very variable term as i see very few updates for my dapper  since edgy is out
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-out
[08:14] <sven> hehe why can't slackware have that "auto"
[08:14] <sven> ahhh i get it
[08:14] <tdn> GaiaX11, you still haven't told me *how* I can reinstall GRUB from the rescue cd. My bet is that I can do mostly the same from the official if you just tell me how to do it.
[08:14] <lucien> i cant figure out do you have a website to lead to tutorial???
[08:14] <kitche> dcordes: look at the backports
[08:14] <RaffoPazzo> yes, you right...this is funny
[08:14] <gnomefreak> sven: or slack or whatever distro other than debian based
[08:14] <waterpie> i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version" any ideas?
[08:14] <cliffd> anyone know how to install ubuntu on a dmraid device?
[08:15] <shwouchk> wow
[08:15] <shwouchk> am only I experiancing huge lags?
[08:15] <sven> gnomefreak, i have ran gentoo for a while but it seems to work differently in other distro's so it's a customized version :D
[08:15] <bullium> do you have to do the install for 6.10 from the live CD? My install keeps locking up at 28% anyone else having the same problem?
[08:15] <Flannel> !grub | tdn, first link here will tell you how to reinstall grub
[08:15] <ubotu> tdn, first link here will tell you how to reinstall grub: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager.

[08:15] <Spliffster> Jimbo: ALT+F2 then type "alacarte" without quotes .. and hit enter. if it doesnt start .... open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get install alacarte.
[08:15] <dcordes> kitche: the backport updates are not tested, right
[08:15] <dcordes> ?
[08:15] <tdn> Flannel, thanks.
[08:15] <nolimitsoya> bullium, there is an alternate install cd without nthe graphical stuff
[08:15] <Ulixes> nolimit
[08:16] <Ulixes> can you help me??
[08:16] <Flannel> bullium: sounds like a bad burn
[08:16] <gnomefreak> dcordes: they are but not as much as regular updates
[08:16] <Random_Transit> has firefox 2 been backported to dapper yet???
[08:16] <Jimbo> Spliffster thanx will try that
[08:16] <bullium> nolimitsoya: I used that for the 6.06, but can't seem to find that for 6.10
[08:16] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, whats your problem?
[08:16] <Spliffster> i can't belive it ... is there not command line utility to configure the base system of an ubuntu server ?
[08:16] <gnomefreak> Random_Transit: it dont look like it will be
[08:16] <Flannel> Random_Transit: I don't believe it will be
[08:16] <kitche> sven: it's auto pretty much in all distros you just have to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst to point to the new kernel and there you go you have an updated grub :)
[08:16] <Spliffster> Jimbo: good luck
[08:16] <Ulixes> after i mount the second disk
[08:16] <bullium> nevermind
[08:16] <nolimitsoya> bullium, there is one, forsure :)
[08:16] <bullium> I just found it:)
[08:16] <Ulixes> how can i use it???
[08:16] <Random_Transit> wow, so much for long-term support
[08:16] <kitche> dcordes: of course they are they are if they were tested then they wouldn't be in backports
[08:16] <RaffoPazzo> whats the output of "grep snd_hda_intel /lib/modules/<your linux kernel version>/modules.dep"
[08:17] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, please highlight me if you want to say something, its nigh impossible tomake out everything if you dont
[08:17] <Flannel> Random_Transit: Support doesn't mean new versions.  That's how ubuntu releases have always been, and always will be.
[08:17] <ZlamerS> hi all
[08:17] <Ulixes> ok
[08:17] <gnomefreak> Random_Transit: long term support means you will get bug fixes and critical update. we can not change versions during stable release
[08:17] <Flannel> Random_Transit: well, I suppose maybe not always will be.  But, it's policy currently.  versions are frozen
[08:17] <Spee_Der> Hello Z
[08:17] <GaiaX11> tdn: In ther alternate cd there are some different options for installing the system. And one of them is called rescue. Choose that one until you reach install grub. So give a click in next an it will be done.
[08:17] <Ulixes> nolimitsoya: how can i use a secondary disk after that i mount it??
[08:17] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: it's empty
[08:17] <sven> kitche, true but it seems gentoo didn't do the automatic thingy as perfect in ubuntu
[08:17] <bullium> I guess it helps to open your eyes and read :)
[08:17] <RaffoPazzo> emtpy?!?!!?
[08:18] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: no output
[08:18] <RaffoPazzo> does it exist?
[08:18] <epp> hey, i just installed the ATI drivers for my card and the fonts are bigger. whats wrong?
[08:18] <RaffoPazzo> ok
[08:18] <Ulixes> nolimit can we speak in private??
[08:18] <dcordes> kitche: i see. i heard about backports sometimes but did not know what they are
[08:18] <sven> but indeed copying and pointing to the newer kernel can to do the trick
[08:18] <Random_Transit> last time i tried to install edgy, it was upgrading from the repos...and it got botched real good...ubu wouldn't start.
[08:18] <bullium> nolimitsoya: thanks for verifing my assumptions
[08:18] <nolimitsoya> Ulixes, if you mount a disk in a folder, that folder is the disk. fex, if you mount /dev/hda1 in /home/ulixes/hda, anything you copy there will go on the disk, and anything already on the disk will be accessible in that folder
[08:18] <macsim> nobody for help me about an ati installation how doesn't work ?
[08:18] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: it doesn't seem to exist o.o
[08:18] <kitche> sven: gentoo doesn't make it automatic really it makes the user check the menu.lst to make sure it's done right anyways some distros don't add new kernels to grub they jsut overwrite the other one that is already there
[08:18] <RaffoPazzo> ok do depmod
[08:19] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: oh, wait
[08:19] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: found it
[08:19] <gnomefreak> sven: i suggest asking in #gentoo if that is what you are using
[08:19] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: but the command gives no output, still
[08:19] <waterpie> i try to: "dpkg -P k3d" and it gives an error: "__main__.PyCentralError: package has no field Python-Version" any ideas?
[08:19] <atlas95> hello
[08:20] <RaffoPazzo> it have to exist at least one row with the path of snd_hda_<i don't remeber> module
[08:20] <gnomefreak> waterpie: are you on dapper or edgy?
[08:20] <atlas95> I'm searching for an alternative for gpsdrive...
[08:20] <nblracer> tdn i dont see the proccess im looking for when i did TOp
[08:20] <epp> why would my fonts get change/get bigger when i install ATI drivers?
[08:20] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin > Ulixes
[08:20] <sven> nope the grub is from ubuntu
[08:20] <atlas95> something with card more "precise"
[08:20] <dylan_> What is the cheat code for safe graphics mode?  "linux [..] "  ?  Thans.
[08:20] <atlas95> card = map :p
[08:20] <rickyfingers> waterpie: time 2 start learning how  2 install fr/ source
[08:21] <kitche> sven: well grub works the same in any distro
[08:21] <RaffoPazzo> do this instead
[08:21] <rickyfingers> i mean tar =xvfz tarball.gz
[08:21] <dusk> rickyfingers: time to learn how to use the english language correctly
[08:21] <RaffoPazzo> grep snd /lib/moduel/<...>
[08:21] <waterpie> gnomefreak: the problem started after upgrading from dapper to edgy
[08:21] <mustafa> hi
[08:21] <gnomefreak> kitche: not really. the commands htemselves change
[08:21] <mustafa> i have installed apache2
[08:21] <sven> kitche, then ubuntu just issues the update-grub command?
[08:21] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: very weird, I can't find it
[08:21] <rickyfingers> then read the readme
[08:21] <mustafa> i dont want it start automatically
[08:21] <mustafa> what do i do
[08:21] <waterpie> rickyfingers: i know that
[08:21] <gnomefreak> waterpie: are there any held back python packages after upgrade?
[08:21] <mustafa> hi
[08:21] <kronoman> hello I was wondering about  getting a new gamepad for my ubuntu computer... should I buy it USB ? will it work without trouble ?
[08:21] <sven> @ the installation
[08:21] <mustafa> i have install apache and doesnt want it to start automatically
[08:22] <kitche> gnomefreak: I have never used grub commands so I wouldn't know but to me they are pretty much all the same besides the patches
[08:22] <RaffoPazzo> havy executed depmod?
[08:22] <max_> hi, i replaced the motherboard on my computer and everything is going fine except i have no sound, i even put a sound card in a PCI slot to see if it was the onboard sound messing up and i have no sound from that either
[08:22] <RaffoPazzo> *have you
[08:22] <gnomefreak> waterpie: pycentral was fixed for that issue before release. it was a major issue for a while in edgy
[08:22] <GaiaX11> Is it safe to upgrade now form dapper to edgy. Because I did it 3 days after the release and i was not luck. My system broke and I had a hard time reinstalling and configuring dapper all again.
[08:22] <dylan_> is there a boot method for installing into safe graphics mode?
[08:22] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: yeah, i can't find a line on modules.dep with snd_hda_intel
[08:22] <waterpie> gnomefreak: update manager says everything up to date, and shows nothing. but the upgrade had problems. it stopped with 8 files not installed
[08:22] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: even after depmod
[08:22] <kitche> sven: I edit grub by hand sicne I don't trust the automatic tools since I find no use for them anyways
[08:22] <RaffoPazzo> ok
[08:23] <gnomefreak> waterpie: than you need to fix that before you do anything
[08:23] <bsb001> Ok, this all sucks - I am using gaim to get here.  I can post messages on the main page - I know, people answer them.  When I click on a name to the right side, under xxx people in room, then click the IM button below it, a new window opens.  I type stuff there, but no-one sees it.  I find this odd, so I do this with my name on the right, click the IM button, and my name opens up.  I type at the bottom, and my typing shows up at the top as
[08:23] <snooplsm> how can I make firefox my default browser?

[08:23] <epp> why would my fonts get change/get bigger when i install ATI drivers?
[08:23] <RaffoPazzo> do grep snd_hda_<...>
[08:23] <epp> is there a fix?
[08:23] <kitche> bsb001: they need to be registered to see your pm's which few here are most likely
[08:23] <snooplsm> ok
[08:23] <waterpie> gnomefreak: i rerun the install script, and rerun it, untill it went down to 3 packages i trink. but then it doesn't do anything more.
[08:23] <liri> does fglrx ati 8.24.8 supports tv out?
[08:24] <RaffoPazzo> what's writed after the "<path module>/<module>: " ?
[08:24] <sven> kitche, well maybe it can overwrite it but @ the installation program it gets every ubuntu kernel there is (4 i remember?) so i guess it " searches for different kernel images at the partition and then in the /boot map in them
[08:24] <gnomefreak> waterpie: what are the errors?
[08:24] <snooplsm> do I need to restart?
[08:24] <omV0> everytime i try to play a video with mplayer, it says "Error opening/initilizing the selected video_out (-vo) device."
[08:24] <waterpie> gnomefreak: now everytime i install/upgrade smt, it complains about an error (that one) but seems to install the other things ok
[08:24] <gnomefreak> waterpie: but tryin to install anything on a broken system isnt gonna help you
[08:24] <kitche> omV0: your not in the video group
[08:24] <waterpie> gnomefreak: yeah. seems to work, but feels like a disaster in waiting.
[08:25] <omV0> kitche: video group?
[08:25] <GaiaX11> Is it safe to upgrade now form dapper to edgy. Because I did it 3 days after the release and i was not luck. My system broke and I had a hard time reinstalling and configuring dapper all again.
[08:25] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: I just type "grep snd_hda_intel"?
[08:25] <RaffoPazzo> no
[08:25] <waterpie> gnomefreak: but i have no idea what to do.
[08:25] <elephanthunter> I'm running a SZ-330P Viao laptop that comes with wireless. The wireless connects fine to begin with, but every other minute the wireless light will start blinking and my computer will temporarily freeze. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[08:25] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: where do I have to grep?
[08:25] <gnomefreak> waterpie: try sudo apt-get -f install   or sudo dpkg --configure -a
[08:25] <RaffoPazzo> grep snd_hda_intel /lib/modules/<kernel version>/modules.dep
[08:25] <kitche> omV0: open up a terminal and type groups and see what groups it outputs for your user
[08:25] <Lattyware> Could anyone help me to get my sound working?
[08:25] <gnomefreak> see if either fix the issue if not pastebin the errors and commands

[08:27] <kcfelix> prestosd: wich video card you have?
[08:28] <prestosd> NVIDIA Riva TNT

[08:28] <prestosd> kcfelix: urg
[08:28] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: Does your volume control move?
[08:28] <prestosd> know anyone who does?
[08:28] <kitche> prestosd: what driver are you using?
[08:29] <max_> im having problems with mine too
[08:29] <max_> hi, i replaced the motherboard on my computer and everything is going fine except i have no sound, i even put a sound card in a PCI slot to see if it was the onboard sound messing up and i have no sound from that either
[08:29] <prestosd> nvidia-glx-legacy
[08:29] <Lattyware> GaiaX11: Yes.
[08:29] <GaiaX11> So I think it is working
[08:29] <kitche> prestosd: awhat's your problem exactly?
[08:29] <Lattyware> But I have noticed that before, when It worked some of the time, the OSS driver showed, when it doesn't work, the OSS driver option shows blank
[08:29] <epp> anyone a X11 and font guru?
[08:30] <Lattyware> and suddenly my audio doesn't work 100% of the time.
[08:30] <prestosd> well, my 3d games used to work (e.g. Neverball) but after I did a clean install of ubuntu 6.10, they dont
[08:30] <bsb001> rickyfingers: you must not have registered in the "Nickserv" screen.  Try going to that tab and typing "/msg nickserv register rickyfingers" with out the quotes, then you can get and send me an IM.
[08:30] <epp> anyone run XGL/BERYL?
[08:30] <prestosd> they worked on my upgraded version of ubuntu 6.10
[08:30] <dougsko> anyone know of a good curses bittorrent client? btdownloadcurses works kind of ok, but it really doesnt have a UI or much functionality
[08:30] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: Have you seen your /etc/group?
[08:31] <dusk> epp: whats up
[08:31] <rickyfingers> bsb u hear me now
[08:31] <bruenig> epp, #ubuntu-xgl
[08:31] <dylan_> What is the cheat code for safe graphics mode?  "linux [..] "  ?  Thanks.
[08:31] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: Are you in the audio group?
[08:31] <kitche> prestosd: did you change your xorg.conf so it uses the nvidia driver?
[08:31] <kcfelix> RaffoPazzo: I'm going. Have some work to do. Thanks for all advice. I'll try to solve this another time. bye
[08:31] <bsb001> I see you on the main screen - not IM
[08:31] <Lattyware> Allthough it is weird, I have three options in the volume control: C-Media PCI CMI8738-MC6 (Alsa), and two SAA7134 mixers, one OSS mixer, one alsa
[08:31] <prestosd> ???? dont think so
[08:31] <Lattyware> GaiaX11: Urm... dunno.
[08:32] <RaffoPazz1> kcfelix: bye
[08:32] <epp> dusk, when you run it does it change your top bar to a more "plain" one?
[08:32] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: I did not get what you said
[08:33] <Lattyware> GaiaX11: (I'm user 'gareth')  - audio:x:29:gareth
[08:33] <kitche> prestosd: that's probably what your problem is xorg might not be using nvidia drivers might be using nv which is the open source nvidia drivers
[08:33] <[erisco] > My web root, /var/www/ is giving me grief. I have chmodded it to 777, and chowned it to my ubuntu name... however every time I try to open a file it gives me the "executable file" options (and not just opening the text file). Also, PHP is unable to write to /var/www/
[08:33] <Lattyware> I have three options in the volume control: C-Media PCI CMI8738-MC6 (Alsa), and two SAA7134 mixers, one OSS mixer, one alsa. I believe the first is my sound card, the other two are my TV card.
[08:33] <prestosd> how do i fix it??
[08:33] <rogue780> can someone tell me if there is a web interface admin tool for apache?
[08:34] <[erisco] > what else can I do to give that directory the same permissions as /home/eric/ ?
[08:34] <Lattyware> I have had my audio working on and off for ages.
[08:34] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: Have you already checked the lines behind you machine?
[08:34] <Lattyware> but recently it never works.
[08:34] <alecjw> [erisco] : make sure that the file that you want to write is owned/writable by www-data
[08:34] <Lattyware> GaiaX11: Yes, the cabling is right.
[08:34] <Jimbo> I installed "wine" but it is no where to be found on this machine that i can see. I also installed "alacarte", and "wine" is not visible there either.
[08:34] <Lattyware> I have tried with sets of headphones and stuff too.
[08:34] <[erisco] > alecjw, it is chmodded to 777, anything should be able to write to it no?
[08:34] <Jimbo> This os is a pain in the ***
[08:34] <kitche> prestosd: do this as root sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop then close X then run sudo nvidia-xconfig and then startX back up
[08:34] <alecjw> Jimbo: it isn't in a menu, just type in wine <program_filename>.exe to run it
[08:35] <Lattyware> I have noticed that when it works, the OSS mixer has sliders, when it doesn't, the sliders are not there.
[08:35] <prestosd> doing that....
[08:35] <kitche> Jimbo: wine is a console app
[08:35] <rogue780> Jimbo: have you tried typing in the console wine file.exe?
[08:35] <Spliffster> Jimbo: open a terminal. type: # wine /path/to/your/application.exe
[08:35] <alecjw> [erisco] : does the folder have the same permissions
[08:35] <kitche> prestosd: that should edit your xorg.conf for you so it will use nvidia
[08:35] <[erisco] > alec, all folders and files in /var/www/ have 777 permissions
[08:35] <Jimbo> what exactly do i type in console?
[08:35] <Lattyware> GaiaX11: Any ideas?
[08:35] <Jimbo> can i just use the terminal?
[08:35] <rogue780> wine your/file.exe
[08:36] <Spliffster> Jimbo: wine /path/to/the/exe/file/you/want/to/execute/.exe
[08:36] <rogue780> Jimbo: terminal is the same thing as console

[08:37] <ROBOd> hello
[08:37] <forsaker> hi :>
[08:37] <ROBOd> i am trying to install firefox2 extensions
[08:37] <ROBOd> none work in ubuntu edgy
[08:37] <rickyfingers> i don't know but in case you don't want your box to be totaly owned
[08:37] <ROBOd> anyone knows why?
[08:37] <forsaker> anyone... is there a package for mppenc and mppdec for edgy?
[08:37] <rickyfingers> don't change /var/www to 6777
[08:37] <kitche> ROBOd: you sure those extensions work in firefox 2
[08:38] <rickyfingers> *777
[08:38] <ROBOd> kitche: dude, i'm positive
[08:38] <[erisco] > rickyfingers, why? :)
[08:38] <ROBOd> Error: installLocation has no properties in file:///usr/lib/firefox/components/nsExtensionManager.js ; Line: 3849

[08:38] <x001x> Hi ppl
[08:38] <rickyfingers> hey caffiend what's up?
[08:39] <caffiend> rickyfingers: got the install to work.  Had to disable the onboard audio
[08:39] <Jimbo> wine /path/to/your/application.exe
[08:39] <tuxtheslacker> hey. what's the command to change my ip addy?
[08:39] <[erisco] > AH! PHP can write to /var/www/ awesome.
[08:39] <hornet123> Hello, what application can i use to undelete files from a memory card ?
[08:39] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: I went out for a while
[08:39] <x001x> when i plug in my WPC-0301 my system hangs.. any clue why ??
[08:39] <bsb001> rickyfingers:  Ok, the universe is out to get me.  You have the answer to my orginial question, but we can't IM cause the stars are out of alignment, or something.  Would you email me your solution?  I am desperate for  an answer.
[08:39] <[erisco] > Will I always get the prompt for text files though?
[08:39] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, you can configure eth0 with ifconfig if thats what you are trying to do?
[08:39] <caffiend> rickyfingers: is VMware difficult to install?
[08:39] <tuxtheslacker> h1st0, no, just to get a new IP.
[08:39] <tuxtheslacker> I was banned from a channel needlessly.
[08:39] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, from dhcp?
[08:40] <kitche> ROBOd: ok does firefox say that the extensions are installed?
[08:40] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, what type of internet do you have?
[08:40] <tuxtheslacker> dpcpcd -N doens't exist for me :-(
[08:40] <ROBOd> kitche: it says error
[08:40] <tuxtheslacker> h1st0, what do you mean?
[08:40] <Jimbo> wine: cannot find '/path/to/the/exe/file/you/want/to/execute/.exe'  now what?
[08:40] <rickyfingers> caffiend: yes, in my experience a complete pain in the a
[08:40] <ROBOd> kitche: and tells me to check the error console
[08:40] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, dialup dsl cable modem?
[08:40] <caffiend> :(
[08:40] <ROBOd> kitche: the error is copied from the error console
[08:40] <rickyfingers> had to edit lost of source code for the thing to go
[08:40] <caffiend> is there an alternative to that program?
[08:40] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, becaues you'd most likely have to reconnect to your isp to get a new ip.
[08:40] <tuxtheslacker> h1st0, shouldn't make a difference, but I'm on a university T1, I'm using a 802.11G connection.
[08:40] <rickyfingers> but I was trying to run frigggen vmware on gentoo
[08:41] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, ifdown eth0 ifup eth0  to reconnect.  But mostlikely you arent' goign to get a different ip.
[08:41] <Tonren> When I try to play a last.fm audio stream in amaroK, it says "No suitable input plugin", and tells me there also might be a network error.  I'm using Ubuntu Edgy 6.10 (not Kubuntu).
[08:41] <rickyfingers> might b easier on a debian or rh install don't know 4 sure
[08:41] <tuxtheslacker> h1st0, I'll just force a static.
[08:41] <h1st0> tuxtheslacker, well then use ifconfig to force a static
[08:41] <caffiend> I'm giving it a shot now.  might be alittle out of my league now though.  can it mess up the install?

[08:52] <ctx144k_> its installed and ruinning
[08:52] <GaiaX11> Lattyware: for you to take away if it is a configuration problem or a hardware one. You should borrows an off board card from someone and insert in a slot and fire ubuntu up to see if it works. If so, then i is a hardware problem and not a config one.
[08:52] <izm99> I think I provided the wrong device for RESUME=XXX/XXX

[08:53] <kitche> matjan: might want to ask that in #ubuntu-xgl might get a better anwser
[08:53] <Lattyware> It's not a hardware problem.

[08:59] <kitche> bsb001: well you have to make a mount point also so you would do sudo mkdir /media/hdb1 then sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1
[09:00] <nolimitsoya> bsb001, mke2fs -j /dev/<partition> is the correct proceedure i think

[09:07] <nolimitsoya> COHO, yes, /etc/apt/source.list
[09:07] <LjL> !info torrentflux | shwouchk, can't you just check?
[09:07] <kitche> shwouchk: you can do a search for it with apt-cache search torrentflux
[09:07] <ubotu> torrentflux: web based, feature-rich BitTorrent download manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1-1ubuntu0.1 (edgy), package size 410 kB, installed size 2688 kB
[09:07] <nolimitsoya> COHO, add 'universe' to the repo link
[09:07] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell shwouchk about packages
[09:07] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: MenZaLap I know. But I had bad experience with up three days after stable release.
[09:07] <madman91> nolimitsoya, its not mounted
[09:07] <MenZaLap> It's still not in a development stage
[09:07] <MenZaLap> ;)
[09:07] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, some methods of upgrading are better than others
[09:07] <shwouchk> thanks
[09:08] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: I used the edgy cd itself.
[09:08] <kitche> GaiaX11: I'll tell you what the sites says not to do don't use gksudo update-manager -c :)
[09:08] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, for what?
[09:08] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: for upgrading
[09:09] <GaiaX11> kitche: So ...
[09:09] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, why? change the repos from dapper to edgy, and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:09] <gnomefreak> kitche: it has been fixed to upgrade smoothly
[09:09] <shawarma> Does anyone have experience with having / on LVM on top of software raid?
[09:09] <ReWT_AxS> well can any one help?
[09:09] <nolimitsoya> GaiaX11, how would one upgrade from the cd?
[09:09] <ReWT_AxS> hey my fans wont stop running in edgy? I have acpi enabled>
[09:09] <symium> i have a ppc question any1 here know ppc/ubuntu?
[09:09] <h1st0> nolimitsoya, you are suposed to be using update-manager
[09:09] <kitche> gnomefreak: well it's still crossed off on the website
[09:09] <gnomefreak> kitche: no its not
[09:09] <h1st0> nolimitsoya, there is a script on the cd
[09:09] <nolimitsoya> h1st0, there are problems with it...
[09:10] <gnomefreak> kitche: not on any of "our" sites
[09:10] <h1st0> nolimitsoya, no there isn't  if the system is up to date.   The problems are with third party software.
[09:10] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: this way gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
[09:10] <ryanakca> where can you find extra backgrounds for slides in OO.o?
[09:10] <CarlFK> how come this doesn't find anything: apt-file search wget
[09:10] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: did you install and update apt-file?
[09:10] <nolimitsoya> CarlFK, apt-cache search wget
[09:10] <h1st0> CarlFK, do you mean apt-cache search wget
[09:10] <GaiaX11> nolimitsoya: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[09:11] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: update apt-file?
[09:11] <COHO> WHen I typed in /etc/apt/sources.list I get an error saying Permission Denied
[09:11] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: before you can use it you have to update it
[09:11] <gnomefreak> !apt-file
[09:11] <ubotu> apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[09:11] <nolimitsoya> COHO, use sudo, and edit with nano
[09:11] <LjL> !apt-file | nolimitsoya, h1st0
[09:11] <ubotu> nolimitsoya, h1st0: apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[09:11] <COHO> what do you mean edit with nano?
[09:11] <symium> is there any way to use a live cd on an imac G5 ppc?
[09:11] <ReWT_AxS> !nano
[09:11] <ubotu> Text Editors: gedit (GNOME), Kate (KDE), vi/vim (terminal-based), terminal based: vi/vim, emacs, nano (user-friendly). HTML/CSS editors: !html; Programming: !code
[09:12] <gnomefreak> symium: get the ppc livecd
[09:12] <ReWT_AxS> just do    nano /path/to/file
[09:12] <GaiaX11> kitche: the site says that it is the other way round. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades
[09:12] <CarlFK> ah.  no.  that would explain.  and to others, I am actualy looking for what pacage(s) conain perl.h, but wget seemed like a more easy test
[09:12] <bsb001> Ok, I did the "sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1" and then returned to Places->Computer and clicked on hdb1, and got, "Unable to mount the selected volume. " and more details showed, "mount: /dev/hdb1 already mounted or /media/hdb1 busy mount: according to mtab, /dev/hdb1 is already mounted on /media/hdb1" - now what?
[09:12] <symium> which one, gnomefreak? edgy? dapper defiantely doesn't work
[09:12] <COHO> so type in sudo /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:12] <GaiaX11> kitche: I mean do not use apt-get for upgrading. So ???!!!
[09:13] <h1st0> bsb001, the drive will be in /media/hdb1
[09:13] <COHO> forget the nano..whatever that is
[09:13] <ubuntu_> hello
[09:13] <gnomefreak> symium: for any. to run livecd on mac you need the ppc livecd
[09:13] <kitche> GaiaX11: that's not the site I m talking about it's ubuntu.com but it was a different part of the site
[09:13] <h1st0> !botsnack
[09:13] <ubotu> Yum!
[09:13] <ubuntu_> im having trouble installing ubuntu, the install icon does nothing
[09:13] <jstarcher> is a 5g partition big enough for /usr?
[09:13] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu_, use the alternate install cd
[09:13] <symium> well breezy & dapper live won't boot from live cd
[09:13] <LjL> jstarcher: depends on what you're going to put on it.
[09:13] <noobguy> hey guys
[09:14] <noobguy> can someone help me with something?
[09:14] <LjL> !helpme
[09:14] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:14] <noobguy> lol ok
[09:14] <GaiaX11> kitche: so, have you had a god experience with apt-get for upgrading? Changing the apt repository?
[09:14] <COHO> NOLIMITSOYA..not sure what you meant by nano
[09:14] <ubuntu_> alternate cd?
=== ubuntu_ is now known as julesFielding
[09:14] <nolimitsoya> COHO, sudo nano /etc/apt/source.list
[09:14] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: if your not using or ever have used compiz/xgl and you have your -desktop package installed apt-get should work fairly well. the update-manager installs -desktop package and will downgrade libgl1-mesa-glx for you since the compiz people made the versioning wrong
[09:14] <LjL> COHO, "nano" is a text editor. typing "nano <filename>" in a terminal will open a text file for editing in nano.
[09:14] <h1st0> jstarcher, it depends on what all you are installing my /usr is 1.9gigs
=== Kastang|Away is now known as kastang
=== kastang is now known as Kastang
[09:15] <Sierra> hey
[09:15] <h1st0> julesFielding, the alternate cd is availbile for download from the same place you got the desktop cd.
[09:15] <h1st0> !alternate | julesFielding
[09:15] <ubotu> julesFielding: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[09:15] <COHO> ok..so what does that have to do with the error I am getting when I type /etc/apt/sources.list?
=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as testfingfsdf
[09:15] <Sierra> has anyone built a .deb for the new version of gtkpod V0.99.8
[09:15] <Sierra> ?
=== testfingfsdf is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[09:15] <julesFielding> oki, thanks, ill try that
[09:16] <Sierra> if not, would anyone like to help me by building one?
[09:16] <noobguy> I have a PowerMac G5 (Dual 2Ghz, 3.5 GB DDR SDRAM, and a ATI Radeon X800XT video card).  I'm trying to install Ubuntu Linux on my mac, but after I insert the cd, and boot from it, I get the Linux Boot Screen (which allows for boot options).  Now, when I press enter, the screen goes white for a couple of seconds and then goes completely black.  Can anyone help me out with this?
[09:16] <jstarcher> LjL: yeah, I'm using about 3g now and it's on a 80gig partition but I want to move it to another partition I have that's 5g. I think I will do it and if I need more I can cross that bridge when I come to it :p
[09:16] <h1st0> !checkinstall | Sierra
[09:16] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: How can i check if i have compiz?
[09:16] <LjL> COHO: it has to do with the fact that the line "/etc/apt/sources.list" is not a valid command and does not make sense.
[09:16] <ubotu> Sierra: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall  -  Please: Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page. - DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[09:16] <nolimitsoya> COHO, please just use the commands you get
[09:16] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: apt wont install -desktop for you. but you need that package to upgrade versions of ubuntu. and apt wont downgrade the libgl1-mesa-glx for you. so for people that have to ask how to upgrade use the update-manager :)
[09:16] <Sierra> I've just bought a new iPod nano and I would love to get it working
[09:16] <nolimitsoya> Sierra, use gtkpod
[09:16] <h1st0> Sierra, use checkinstall to create a deb
[09:17] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: use the update-manager command as its pretty much thinkless. to check if yuou have a package installed use apt-cache policy compiz
[09:17] <noobguy> can anyone help with my problem?
[09:17] <gnomefreak> or apt-cache policy packagename
[09:17] <bgrupe> Sierra: tried using amarok yet? if that works you don't need to compile anything etc.
[09:17] <shwouchk> If i dont set a root password, then there is no way for anyone/anyhow to log in as root, right? (excluding getting root from another user)
[09:17] <symium> gnomefreak, the breezy live cd boots but hangs at loading desktop. dapper won't boot at all
[09:17] <Sierra> I dont want to use KDE apps on gnome
[09:17] <Sierra> and I am using gtkpod nolimitsoya
[09:17] <h1st0> noobguy, I don't have any experience with macs but have you tried searching ont he forums.  www.ubuntuforums.org   i'm sure someone will have a howto on there.
[09:17] <Sierra> but -- i need the next version :)
[09:17] <bgrupe> amarok is worth it anyway :)
[09:17] <kitche> shwouchk: yeah someone will have to break the user account to run sudo
[09:18] <Sierra> the repos are old
[09:18] <LjL> COHO, "/etc/apt/sources.list" is a text file (in particular, it's a configuration file for the APT system).  your shell expects that you type a *command* on it, possibly followed by a filename - and "/etc/apt/sources.list" is not a command. "nano /etc/apt/sources.list", on the other hand, is, because "nano" is a command (i.e. a file that is executable and contains a program)
[09:18] <gnomefreak> symium: make sure the md5sum is correct and make sure you burn it at a very low speed
[09:18] <h1st0> Sierra, use checkinstall to create your own deb
[09:18] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: I have checked and dont't have compiz in.
[09:18] <GenNMX> Hi, the installer shows "Ubuntu" and has about 7 tiny one-pixel sized white dots underneath of it, and just sits there. The DVDRW drive is being accessed, so I'm guessing its loading...but is this the correct graphic I'm looking at? I've tried regular and "Safe Graphics" modes. After a while, it goes to some refresh rate not supported by my monitor.
[09:18] <shwouchk> kitche: yeah, obviously.. thanks!
[09:18] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: so you have your -desktop package installed?
[09:18] <LjL> shwouchk, if they have physical access to the machine, they always can
[09:18] <symium> the cd is ok i've checked it-actually the breezy cd is from caniocal
[09:18] <noobguy> h1st0: I actually have successfully installed Ubuntu on this machine before.  It seems that after I installed my new video card, this problem began to occur.  I am wondering if there is a way to install Ubuntu without using the GUI (i.e. through terminal)
[09:18] <shwouchk> LjL: I meant someone from the net
[09:19] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: if kde kubuntu-desktop if gnome ubuntu-desktop if xfce xubuntu-desktop
[09:19] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: I am in ubuntu-desktop
[09:19] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: make sure the package is installed
[09:19] <h1st0> GenNMX, its possible you will have to use the alternate iso to install
=== Kastang is now known as Kastang|Away
[09:19] <h1st0> !alternate | noobguy GenNMX
[09:19] <ubotu> noobguy GenNMX: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[09:19] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: just because your using gnome doesnt mean that package is installe
[09:19] <gnomefreak> d
[09:19] <LjL> shwouchk, they won't be able to login as root, no. but then you shouldn't allow SSH to root even if you're on a system where the root account *is* accessible
[09:19] <h1st0> noobguy, with the alternate iso you could install in text mode.
[09:19] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: ubuntu-desktop package?
[09:19] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop
[09:19] <ubotu> k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[09:19] <noobguy> where can I get the alternate cd?
[09:19] <Sierra> h1st0, ill use check install or ask a mate to build me a .deb
[09:19] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: now you see why update-manager -c is easier
[09:20] <ademan> does bash store your current working directory in an environment variable?
[09:20] <LjL> noobguy: same place you get the desktop cd
[09:20] <Sierra> h1st0, thanks for your help
[09:20] <shwouchk> LjL: root can log into a tty w/o a password?
[09:20] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop
[09:20] <nolimitsoya> noobguy, same ftp as you got the desktop one
[09:20] <LjL> shwouchk: uh? no, i never said that
[09:20] <LjL> shwouchk: in Ubuntu, root cannot login directly at all, by default. in other distributions, it can -- but what i'm saying is that you should *never* have root enabled for remote access anyway
[09:20] <shwouchk> noobguy: you can install ubuntu server w/o a gui
[09:20] <symium> gnomefreak, do you know wheter the edgy live cd is better than prevous ppc ?
[09:21] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak:  Instalado: 0.120
[09:21] <kitche> ademan: just type pwd and it will show you the working directory
[09:21] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: installed :-)
[09:21] <shwouchk> LjL: oh, yeah
[09:21] <gnomefreak> symium: dont know my hardware wont allow me to install with edgy livecd.
[09:21] <GaiaX11> So. with is the command to up now?
[09:21] <GenNMX> Ah seems it's a bad burn of the CD, getting Buffer I/O errors when I remove the splash screen.
[09:22] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: did you changes your sources.list file?
[09:22] <h1st0> Sierra, What architecture are you using?
[09:22] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: I will.
[09:22] <ademan> kitche: but is there an environment variable? i need to access it inside a program i'm writing, and i want to avoid calling other programs if at all possible
[09:22] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: after that sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:22] <LjL> ademan: $PWD
[09:22] <ademan> LjL: thanks
[09:23] <EmxBA> an I make very small partition (around 10 MB) and put only grub on it? is there any howto for that? I want to have seperate small boot partition, how can I make it?
[09:23] <symium> gnomefreak my cds are ok but only breezy boots then hangs at loading desktop dapper no boot-don't know if i shoud try edgy or not
[09:23] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: great! Thanx.
[09:23] <EmxBA> !grub > EmxBA
[09:23] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: *notice* any non official packages installed may give you errors and failt to upgrade without some work
[09:23] <jstarcher> if I change the profile in Gnome terminal in the middle of executing a command will it freeze?
[09:23] <h1st0> Sierra, they have debian packages availible on their site
[09:23] <bit0> hi!, i'm looking for a _good_ ocr for linux, gocr works ... anything better?
[09:23] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: Ok!
[09:23] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: comment out the unofficial repos if any
[09:23] <LjL> bit0: i doubt it. well, there are commercial ones
[09:23] <Sierra> h1st0, the debs are out of date
[09:24] <anthonykid> h1st0: im back
[09:24] <Sierra> h1st0, look at the version difference
[09:24] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: right
[09:24] <EmxBA> anyone?
[09:24] <h1st0> Sierra, they are .99.4-1  looks like the current one.  unless you are talkinga bout building from svn?
[09:24] <anthonykid> one question, anyone mind answering... how do you install applications on ubuntu? it's rather strange (and i sort of cant figure it out...) --> is Add/Remove the only way?
[09:24] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell anthonykid about apt
[09:24] <Sierra> h1st0, The latest stable version is V0.99.8 r
[09:24] <h1st0> anthonykid, synaptic is another way
[09:25] <bit0> LjL: and free software?
[09:25] <LjL> bit0: i said - i doubt it.
[09:25] <Flannel> anthonykid: add/remove is a simplified version, synaptic is the 'full featured' GUI apt frontend
[09:25] <anthonykid> hmm
[09:25] <h1st0> anthonykid, System > administration > Synaptic Package manager
[09:25] <kitche> anthonykid: or apt-get install but synaptic is better for people new to the debian world
[09:25] <Flannel> anthonykid: and of course, you can compile your own/etc, but then you lose the benefits of package management
[09:25] <Abst> Does anyone know how to solve if I just get a black screen at X and I cant do any keyboard shortcuts to get out
[09:25] <Sierra> h1st0, http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67873
[09:25] <ademan> also, is there any way to make a package manager be aware of what a *.run installer does? (ie create a package that knows where everything went, for say, wolfenstein enemy territory)
[09:25] <h1st0> anthonykid, you can also install from source.   Check out this link will show you how to install anything in ubuntu http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[09:25] <symium> EmX3a, have you tried to install grub to your root partition?
[09:25] <LjL> bit0: there's ocrad and tesseract that i can think of, but i'd say gocr is better than either. you could try though
[09:26] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell ademan about checkinstall
[09:26] <winwood> hallo
[09:26] <ademan> LjL: will that work for executable installers though?
[09:26] <h1st0> Sierra, have you tried the versionin ubuntu yet?
[09:26] <LjL> ademan: in theory it should
[09:26] <Sierra> h1st0, its version .4
[09:26] <ademan> LjL: oh, ok, sweet
[09:26] <Sierra> h1st0, I need .8
[09:26] <h1st0> Sierra, does it not work or something?
[09:26] <EmxBA> symium: i want to have boot partition
[09:27] <Sierra> h1st0, it works fine, but i have a gen 2 iPod nano
[09:27] <EmxBA> instead of having grub on root partition
[09:27] <ademan> i knew about checkinstall, but i wasn't sure if it worked with executables
[09:27] <kitche> Sierra: yes you will have to make a .deb or compile from source
[09:27] <h1st0> LjL, please lol
[09:27] <LjL> ademan: *personally* i wouldn't trust it. but then i wouldn't trust a ".run" or ".bin" installer in the first place
[09:27] <Ratlord> Hey...Anyone here know how to fix the X Server problem?
[09:27] <carrotcake> so I am having a problem, when I put in the ubuntu 6.10 dvd, and try to go into the live mode, it just hangs after the load sequence, and nothing happens.  Just a blank screen
[09:27] <Sierra> kitche, thanks :) do you know someone who will make it for me?
[09:27] <LjL> h1st0, ?
[09:27] <h1st0> Sierra, well if it works why do you need a different version?
[09:27] <anthonykid> all: are there any good p2p apps for ubuntu?
[09:27] <kitche> Sierra: nope not really
[09:27] <boink> carrotcake: then try the alternate install CD
[09:27] <h1st0> Sierra, What architecture are you running?
[09:28] <ademan> LjL: unfortunately that's all i have for a few things, such as enemy territory, and the add on i'd like to try, True Combat: Elite
[09:28] <kitche> h1st0 the new version of gtkpod is better then the older version in ipod working
[09:28] <Sierra> h1st0, when I say works -- i mean that it installs, i dont know if my ipod will work with it
[09:28] <Ratlord> carrotcake: I have the same problem
[09:28] <ademan> both are closed source :-/
[09:28] <adm> anthonykid, frostwire?
[09:28] <ademan> or at least TC:E is
[09:28] <boink> I had to use the alternate install cd myself
[09:28] <anthonykid> adm, thanks
[09:28] <symium> EmxBA, you still need to have something in your MBR to start the boot
[09:28] <carrotcake> boink: tried the alternate of 6.06 and the same result
[09:28] <Sierra> h1st0, i368
[09:28] <Ratlord> Hmm I got the Alternate CD, but what option should I select?
[09:28] <carrotcake> I am guessing its a video issue
[09:28] <h1st0> Sierra, I could try building a deb for you if you really want but I don't know if ti will work for you.  Checkinstall is fairly easy to use.  It wouldn't be that hard for you to build it yourself.
[09:28] <boink> I used the alternate CD for Xubuntu on an ancient Sony Laptop
[09:29] <winwood> 2carrotcake: try the alternate cd of ubuntu
[09:29] <EmxBA> symium: yes, can i have grub files on seperate partition and then do a "grub-install --root-directory=/dev/grubootpartition /dev/hda"
[09:29] <LjL> ademan, then you don't have many options. another package you might want to keep in mind is
[09:29] <LjL> !cruft
[09:29] <Sierra> h1st0, i386 deb
[09:29] <ubotu> cruft: Find any cruft built up on your system. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.6-0.15 (edgy), package size 46 kB, installed size 1096 kB
[09:29] <EmxBA> that will install grub from boot partition to mbr, symium?
[09:29] <Sierra> h1st0, would be really nice if you could -- we could put it on ubuntu forums
[09:29] <ademan> LjL: oh cool, thanks
[09:29] <EmxBA> and which files do i need to have
[09:29] <Sierra> h1st0, for all the others that want the new version
[09:29] <winwood> Someone knows how to fix the wrong colors of webcam with camgrab ?
[09:29] <symium> EmxBA, what you've typed should work
[09:30] <Sierra> h1st0, oh -- dw, someone else has offered :)
[09:30] <h1st0> Sierra, sudo apt-get build-dep gtkpod       then download the source.  tar -xvzf gtkpod-0.99.8.tar.gz   cd into the gtkpod directory.  Then ./config  then make then sudo checkinstall
[09:30] <Sierra> h1st0, ok thanks!
[09:30] <EmxBA> symium: just, which files do i need to have on that boot partition? can i copy the /boot folder from my root partition to that boot partition?
[09:30] <h1st0> Sierra, ./configure not ./config sorry.
[09:31] <nixbox> hi all
[09:31] <nixbox> i have a console where some output is displayed as a result of receiving a packet. I have to telnet to the console to see the output. I want to log the output, I know I can use screen, but the problem is I also want to have a timestamp at the start of each line but screen can't do that. Moreover the time is going to be of millisecond granularity. Any ideas how to do that?
[09:31] <symium> EmxBA, provided hda is your 1st/primary drive it should install to MBR, yes
[09:31] <ladydoor> EmxBA: if you do that, be sure to use sudo cp -a so as to preserve symlinks, be recursive, etc.
[09:31] <h1st0> Sierra, I could give it a try but I don't know much about setting the dependencies or versions up properly with checkinstall.
[09:31] <anthonykid> all: where are apps located in the HDD
[09:31] <EmxBA> ok
[09:31] <anthonykid> (file system)
[09:31] <EmxBA> thanks to both, symium and ladydoor
[09:31] <winwood> are u sure u wanna use telnet? ssh / rlogin are secured
[09:31] <Ratlord> I tried the alternate CD and I'm not sure what thing I should select on that menu screen...
[09:31] <kitche> anthonykid: /usr/bin usually if you install using a packager manager
[09:32] <EmxBA> anthonykid: /bin/, then /usr/bin, and /sbin
[09:32] <COHO> ok....getting somewhere!!! My Linksys USB adapter detects networks around the area
[09:32] <Flannel> Ratlord: the install option.  Regular normal (not expert) install
[09:32] <COHO> question is how do I log onto mine
[09:32] <Flannel> Ratlord: well, if ou want a desktop machine
[09:32] <b33r-> *** Could not run GLIB test program, checking why...
[09:32] <b33r-> *** The test program failed to compile or link. See the file config.log for the
[09:32] <b33r-> *** exact error that occured. This usually means GLIB is incorrectly installed.
[09:32] <b33r-> configure: error: "Cannot find glib"
[09:32] <jstarcher> I just copied a bunch of files using 'cp -rv' My question is if there were any errors would it list them in the last lines of the command so I know?
[09:32] <LjL> !paste | b33r-
[09:32] <ubotu> b33r-: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[09:32] <AV1611> text install is what you should try first
[09:32] <symium> EmxBA, if you are going to create a seperate boot partition you can just have grub install to that i beleieve
[09:32] <Ratlord> Flannel, I'm on a laptop
[09:32] <AV1611> I guess so
[09:32] <EmxBA> ok
[09:33] <Xaphoo> I really wish gdesklets was better
[09:33] <Ratlord> And I think I heard someone say do the rescue thing last night...So I tried that, and got confused.
[09:33] <b33r-> LjL: that's not a large text -.-
[09:33] <zipzo> i am trying to drag a file from one folder to another, and im told tht i do not have permission...
[09:33] <Flannel> Ratlord: oh, this to reinstall grub?
[09:33] <winwood> xaphoo: adesklets is lightweight compared to gdesklets
[09:33] <kitche> anthonykid: usually you don't have to touch things in /sbin unless your doing some admining of your machine
[09:33] <LjL> b33r-: it's annoying enough on a channel with 950 people on it. anyway, what is your question?
[09:33] <Ratlord> *shrugs* I never knew I installed grub :/
[09:33] <zipzo> how do i get permission to copy folder in the GUI?
[09:33] <Xaphoo> yes, its lightweight but harder to use and not as many desklets... and of those fewer are good
[09:33] <anthonykid> kitche: im in /usr/bin, and im not seeing anything
[09:33] <anthonykid> (as far as apps go)(
[09:34] <Ratlord> I got like a text install, command line install, and some other install thing. Not sure which one to pick
[09:34] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell zipzo about sudo
[09:34] <Flannel> Ratlord: grub is what ubuntu uses to boot with, it also lets you select kernel versions, or betwen ubuntu/windows, etc.
[09:34] <zipzo> i know about sudo
[09:34] <kitche> anthonykid: are you looking for .exe by chance?
[09:34] <Abst> Does anyone know how to solve if I just get a black screen at X and I cant do any keyboard shortcuts to get out
[09:34] <Abst> Any help?
[09:34] <nkayhan> zipzo: just type (in a terminal) sudo "whatever your file manager is"
[09:34] <LjL> zipzo: that page also explains what you asked. read it
[09:34] <b33r-> LjL:  why am I getting that error when I try to compile?
[09:34] <jikanter> Abst: use kernel magic
[09:34] <ladydoor> Abst: what happens if you hit ctrl+alt+F!
[09:34] <anthonykid> kitche: nah.. just trying to install frostwire with synaptic
[09:34] <ladydoor> *F1
[09:34] <LjL> nkayhan: not quite, you're not supposed to use sudo for GUI apps
[09:34] <FantasticFoo> soooo... how do i upgrade to edgy now?
[09:34] <AV1611> and grub is installed at the very end of the installation process
[09:34] <Abst> jikanter, What
[09:34] <mike1> has anyone gotten pandora.jar to work?  how did you do it
[09:34] <kitche> anthonykid: well when you install frostwine it should have made a menu item for it
[09:34] <FantasticFoo> can't i just do apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade?
[09:34] <GenNMX> abst: Ctrl+F7 to get the terminal.
[09:34] <nkayhan> LjL: it'l work fine, try it
[09:34] <LjL> b33r-: because you don't have the development package of glib installed perhaps? that's what the error seems to say
[09:34] <Flannel> Ratlord: what are the exact choices?  Sorry, they change them each Ubuntu version ;)
[09:35] <Abst> GenNMX, Letme try
[09:35] <zipzo> ubotu didnt give me any page to read though
[09:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about didnt give me any page to read though - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:35] <Abst> ladydoor, Letme try
[09:35] <winwood> if you find enough adesklets, you just have to press r when running the *.py file to register and maek the adesklets work. gdesklets of course has more :-(
[09:35] <LjL> nkayhan: doesn't mean it's the correct way to do it. and it doesn't work fine with all apps and on all systems.
[09:35] <LjL> !works for em
[09:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about works for em - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:35] <LjL> !works for me
[09:35] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[09:35] <Ratlord> Flannel, I'll go set it up, then come back and tell you, ok?
[09:35] <Ratlord> start it up*
[09:35] <GenNMX> abst: Oh wait sorry, other way around, CTRL+ALT+F1
[09:35] <jikanter> Abst: can you get to a shell of some kind?
[09:35] <ladydoor> GenNMX: control+alt+F7 takes you to X, actually.
[09:35] <GenNMX> abst: F7 gets you back to X
[09:35] <munsa> howdy
[09:35] <Abst> GenNMX, I just said they dont work
[09:35] <FantasticFoo> nobody knows how to upgrade to edgy?
[09:36] <LjL> b33r-: try installing libglib2.0-dev
[09:36] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell FantasticFoo about upgrade
[09:36] <AV1611> BTW, did anybody ever tried to work at UBUNTU at NEC low-end laptops (M500, P520))? What are your impressions?
[09:36] <Flannel> Ratlord: Sounds great
[09:36] <nkayhan> whatever, then gksudo right?
[09:36] <Abst> jikanter, I can in recovery mode
[09:36] <Ratlord> Ok
[09:36] <munsa> Fantasticfoo I think its a bad idea to upgrade
[09:36] <zipzo> could someone just tell me how i can get root privelege in thre GUI?
[09:36] <jikanter> ok, do that
[09:36] <munsa> from what I read
[09:36] <LjL> nkayhan: if you're on gnome, yup
[09:36] <munsa> its a killer
[09:36] <jikanter> then, type this
[09:36] <munsa> best to do a fresh install
[09:36] <Flannel> Ratlord: wait, is this on the same computer?  I can google if youd have to restart twice to do it.
[09:36] <jikanter> sudo su
[09:36] <ladydoor> zipzo: use gksudo if you're in gnome and kdesu if in KDE
[09:36] <kitche> zipzo:; gksudo <gui app>
[09:36] <LjL> zipzo, read. that. page.
[09:36] <izm99> is there a key I can push during bootup to remove the splash and see the deatils?
[09:36] <winwood> fantastic: apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:36] <nkayhan> yea, I'm on xfce, but it still works (don't kill me)
[09:36] <munsa> hey wasnt Edgy supposed to come with XGL installed?
[09:36] <Abst> munsa, No
[09:36] <jstarcher> how can I list the amount of files in a directory?
[09:37] <munsa> dont do it fantastic
[09:37] <zipzo> LjL...WHAT PAGE???
[09:37] <winwood> 2fantastic: after changing to right sources.list
[09:37] <LjL> izm99: could try alt+f1 or alt+f2
[09:37] <kitche> munsa it has aiglx installed
[09:37] <munsa> or something like xgl?
[09:37] <izm99> LjL, thx
[09:37] <LjL> !sudo | zipzo, *this* page
[09:37] <munsa> ah
[09:37] <ubotu> zipzo, *this* page: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[09:37] <munsa> kitche
[09:37] <FantasticFoo> munsa: really?
[09:37] <munsa> kitche basically the same as xgl/
[09:37] <FantasticFoo> munsa: how come?
[09:37] <munsa> yea
[09:37] <noelferreira> hi people anyone has rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[09:37] <Ratlord> Yes, Flannel, it's on the same computer
[09:37] <Ratlord> Well, I could go start it up on my aunt and uncles computer, leaving this one running
[09:37] <anthonykid> all: i installed frostwire, and it wont open when i click on it via Apps --> internet
[09:37] <GenNMX> Abst: Then once you're back to the console, login and try X -probeonly
[09:37] <kitche> munsa; it's Xorg's version of it but if you have nvidia you don't really need it
[09:37] <Flannel> Ratlord: let me google then, no need for so many restarts
[09:37] <LjL> izm99: or you can remove the splash screen completely by messing with menu.lst, or add some text to the splash in the same manner
[09:38] <Paddy_EIRE> is there a bug in edgys' "sessions" option in Systme > Preferences? as whenever I log out it does not ask me to save changes nor does it remember any app that I add to the Startup Programmes list
[09:38] <munsa> Fantasticfoo google for Edgy upgrade most people have disastrous outcomes.
[09:38] <Ratlord> Nah, it's ok. I can just go do it on my aunt and uncle's computer.
[09:38] <Flannel> Ratlord: this is edgy? or dapper?
[09:38] <Abst> jikanter, Im root
[09:38] <FantasticFoo> munsa: ok
[09:38] <Ratlord> Edgy
[09:38] <bognar> if there is anybody who play lineage2 on dragon network pls pm me
[09:38] <FantasticFoo> munsa: i'll wait then
[09:38] <munsa> kitch naw i have ATI
[09:38] <LjL> izm99: you could even do that temporarily by pressing "e" while in Grub and setting (or removing) the relevant options (which are "splash" and "quiet")
[09:38] <munsa> ok, or just do a fresh install
[09:38] <GenNMX> Abst: That'll try to load X, but not actually load X itself, just test out your configuration and allow you to see error messages.
[09:38] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: there is no checkbox that says save session?
[09:38] <izm99> LjL, no no.  I generally like the splash.  :)  Oh, Grub options are interesting.  Thanks.
[09:38] <jikanter> ok, now type this: echo 1 /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
[09:38] <munsa> fantasticfoo apparently it just destorys everything and people like freakout and then you gotta break someting or kick the cat or something
[09:38] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: there is but it does not work
[09:39] <noelferreira> hi people anyone has rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[09:39] <boink> anyone using Xen on ubuntu?
[09:39] <Abst> jikanter, ?
[09:39] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: basically a fresh install with the updates
[09:39] <jikanter> then, hold down the right alt-key
[09:39] <izm99> After running fsck, I still can't login with my default (system's first and only) user.
[09:39] <LjL> jikanter, i think that's enabled by default at least in Edgy though
[09:39] <GenNMX> Abst: Did CTRL+ALT+F1 work to getting back to console?
[09:39] <jikanter> oh, ok
[09:39] <LjL> jikanter: and i guess you forgot a > ;)
[09:39] <jikanter> oops
[09:39] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: what Desktop enviroment are you using gnome kde xfce?
[09:39] <noelferreira> hi people anyone has rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[09:39] <Flannel> Ratlord: you want to "Install in Text Mode"
[09:39] <freeomen> what could be the problem if you install a library package and the other program you're compiling doesn't see it?
[09:40] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: gnome
[09:40] <GenNMX> Grrr, I'm still getting Buffer I/O errors on my second burn.
[09:40] <Ratlord> Install in text mode? Ok
[09:40] <Ratlord> Want me to go try it now?
[09:40] <Slim^snief^schu> Whats the problem if i sign in on ubuntu 6.10, then it loads the desktop, then the destktop image, and then im redirected to the login screen ?
[09:40] <jikanter> ok, hold down the right altkey , sysrq, then the number 5
[09:40] <winwood> Cafe: what s your Irc you are using ?
[09:40] <anthonykid> kitche: i installed frostwire and it wont launch
[09:40] <Ecko2056> does anyone know what this app is called? its the icon bar at the bottom of this screenshot.. http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre1/47611-1.jpg
[09:40] <KenSentMe> freeomen: have you tried installing the library-dev package?
[09:40] <noelferreira> hi people anyone has rt61 wireless driver working on edgy?
[09:40] <Abst> jikanter, Me?
[09:40] <freeomen> KenSentMe, no.. do i need to?
[09:41] <Paddy_EIRE> anthonykid: do you have the Java runtime environment installed
[09:41] <kitche> !frostwire > anthonykid
[09:41] <Flannel> Ratlord: it's up to you, but that's the selection you'll want
[09:41] <Ratlord> Ok
[09:41] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: hmm did you add the autostart to gnome-session-properties?
[09:41] <winwood> http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre1/47611-1.jpg , it s a adesklets if I recall well , look in screenshots adesklets
[09:41] <izm99> Ecko2056, i think that might be a gdesklet
[09:41] <avn_> hi! any tips on install of nvidia? checked many help pages - no success so far
[09:41] <jikanter> ok, then type alt-sysrq, then h
[09:41] <Tomcat_> Ecko2056: In Linux?
[09:41] <Ecko2056> yes
[09:41] <avn_> nvidia on i810
[09:41] <boink> what's a good wireless scanning software on ubuntu?
[09:41] <KenSentMe> freeomen: most of the time you need the -dev packages for compiling program with the library supported
[09:41] <anthonykid> Paddy_EIRE: i dont believe so
[09:41] <bruenig> Ecko2056, I think it might be called engage
[09:41] <jikanter> and you should get some output
[09:41] <Ratlord> I'll go on mIRC on my aunt and uncle's computer and run it on my laptop now...So that way I can tell you what's going on and ask questions...
[09:41] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: what is that
[09:41] <Ratlord> Brb
[09:41] <Tomcat_> Ecko2056: There's a gdesklet like that... as izm99 said.
[09:41] <winwood> http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre1/47611-1.jpg  ; the clock is it adesklets or gdesklets ?
[09:41] <jstarcher> avn_: you look at the FAQ?
[09:41] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: it's how you make apps Autostart in gnome
[09:42] <freeomen> KenSentMe, i'll try installing it and see how it works out
[09:42] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: where can I find that file
[09:42] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: System -> Settings -> Session -> Start Programs
[09:42] <jikanter> Abst, any luck?
[09:42] <izm99> Ecko2056, there's also a "proof-of-concept" experiment using cairo... but it's not very usable, I don't think.
[09:42] <Slim^snief^schu> Whats the problem if i sign in on ubuntu 6.10, then it loads the desktop, then the destktop image, and then im redirected to the login screen ?
[09:43] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: I already told you that way does not work
[09:43] <alkali> Hey guys, bit of a technical question, but how do I make sure iptables is enabled in the kernel I'm compiling?  I'm curious what heading it's under.  I did copy my original config file but I'd rather be safe than sorry and recompiling

[09:45] <kitche> Paddy_EIRE: yes
[09:45] <Paddy_EIRE> kitche: where is it
[09:45] <boink> alkali: save it, then look at the .config file

[09:47] <anthonykid> Paddy_EIRE: well im on 6.1, and i know is dapper, so im assuming this is edy?

[09:49] <KenSentMe> freeomen: ah ok
[09:49] <h1st0> Sierra, ahh well I guess I can try it if you want.
[09:49] <GenNMX> md5sum -c ubuntu-6.10-desktop-amd64.iso.md5 just sits there
[09:49] <t3chn0b0y> does any one know how to clear or restore the open with i got dub's bad.. im using edgy ubuntu , thanks..
[09:49] <LjL> b33r-: what program is that anyway?
[09:49] <h1st0> Sierra, do you want me to?
[09:50] <LjL> GenNMX: depends on how long it sits there. it's *supposed* to take some time, since it's checking more than 600Mb of data
[09:50] <Paddy_EIRE> anthonykid: you may need to reinstall frostwire after you install the JRE im not sure
[09:50] <LjL> GenNMX: though i'm not sure that's the right syntax
[09:50] <GenNMX> LjL: Yeah, but there's no status indicator, and man md5sum seems to indicate there's no option to get one.
[09:50] <CheshireViking> kitche: Thanks, just got a 320Gb drive for media storage & trying to decide what to format it as & whether to put it in a linux or windows xp machine
[09:50] <KenSentMe> freeomen: is it in the ubuntu repo's? I can't find it there
[09:50] <twotone> Can someone help me, I am a really new to linux as I just quit the windows habit.
[09:51] <Milos_SD> Hello everybody...
[09:51] <freeomen> KenSentMe, i'm on another distro :P
[09:51] <Sierra> h1st0, yes please!
[09:51] <h1st0> Sierra, k hold up
[09:51] <Milos_SD> can somebody help me?
[09:51] <GenNMX> LjL: Scratch that, the use of -status seems to indicate there -should- be verbosity in progress.
[09:51] <Sierra> h1st0, if you are confident that it will work
[09:51] <dale> hi everyone!
[09:51] <freeomen> pclinuxos
[09:51] <KenSentMe> twotone: just ask your questions here
[09:51] <LjL> GenNMX, i'm not sure about the -c option, i usually just run "md5sum blah.iso" and then check it against the correct md5
[09:51] <b33r-> LjL: I wanna install x-chat
[09:51] <KenSentMe> freeomen: ah, ok
[09:51] <h1st0> Sierra, it will work if you have all the dependencies met
[09:51] <Milos_SD> my dpgk is broken...
[09:51] <LjL> b33r-: and why do you have to compile it?
[09:51] <nel356> help me
[09:51] <LjL> !help me
[09:51] <freeomen> KenSentMe, there is no support channel for that
[09:51] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl  -  Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[09:52] <LjL> !helpme
[09:52] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:52] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: which is better to do the up. apt-get or aptitude?
[09:52] <twotone> I watn acess to all my files like music and such that I had when I used windows but now that windows won't even run on my computer all I have is the 20 gigs I set aside when I set up ubuntu. How do I get access to those files through ubuntu
[09:52] <twotone> want*
[09:52] <Sierra> h1st0, there is only one dependancy ;p
[09:52] <nel356> question if
[09:52] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: apt-get during upgrade
[09:52] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell twotone about windowsdrives
[09:52] <h1st0> Sierra, no there are many
[09:52] <b33r-> LjL: because in repos there's an old version
[09:52] <compengi> b33r-, rofl
[09:52] <nel356> 6.10
[09:53] <GenNMX> LjL: Is it suppose to just sit there without showing any kind of progress indicator? Since that's what it's doing, even if I manually type in the md5sum.
[09:53] <Milos_SD> /var/lib/dpgk/available  is missing, after I restart my PC with restart button...
[09:53] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak:  and this one? sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade  ???!!
[09:53] <worldwideserve23> hello folks
[09:53] <ROBOd> hello guys
[09:53] <ROBOd> i have ubuntu edgy
[09:53] <epp> i have a dlink WDA-1320, how can i get it to use WPA?
[09:53] <nel356> hello
[09:53] <LjL> GenNMX: i don't type in anything at all normally. i just type "md5sum blah.iso", wait, and then check the MD5 that it outputs against the correct one by eye.
[09:53] <KenSentMe> !wpa | epp
[09:53] <ubotu> epp: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:53] <GenNMX> LjL: Ugh well anyway, I'm re-downloading the iso using direct download this time, I keep getting a failed install and Buffer I/O errors from my torrent download.
[09:53] <ROBOd> i want to disable the very uninformative dismissing boot splash
[09:53] <LjL> GenNMX, and yes, it sits there.
[09:53] <ROBOd> how to do it?
[09:53] <Slim^snief^schu> Whats the problem if i sign in on ubuntu 6.10, then it loads the desktop, then the destktop image, and then im redirected to the login screen ?
[09:53] <ROBOd> i want all boot info, just like in dapper
[09:54] <t3chn0b0y> i am feeling edgy today :D
[09:54] <nel356> no comprise
[09:54] <worldwideserve23> hey folks
[09:54] <LjL> ROBOd: remove "quiet" from menu.lst to get back the terse status info on the splash screen, or remove "splash" to get the splash screen away completely
[09:54] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: you dont need to run apt0get upgrade and dist-upgrade only update and dist-upgrade and i would stick with apt-get as aptitude may not fix things as much as it would like. aptitude likes to downgrade items if cant find a way to upgrade
[09:54] <worldwideserve23> how do you install thunderbird

[09:56] <EdgeT> Guys I can't load windoze xp on grub :( Please help me it's URGENT :(
[09:56] <LjL> or not
[09:56] <Milos_SD> and I can't do any installation
[09:56] <dale> gnomefreak: I've tried installing it before, but it breaks my wireless settings
[09:56] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell dale about upgrade
[09:57] <KenSentMe> EdgeT: what error do you get?
[09:57] <EdgeT> It told that to me lol
[09:57] <Milos_SD> and nautilus can't recognise any luncher or package...
[09:57] <EdgeT> KenSentMe: I don't see it
[09:57] <Milos_SD> so I can't run it...
[09:57] <LjL> EdgeT, yes, i had it tell it to you as well, since your suggestion was wrong
[09:57] <EdgeT> KenSentMe: I only see Ubuntu
[09:57] <Ubunturookie> hello all...is anyone here running ubuntu on an nvidia raid 0 configuration?
[09:57] <littlebird> Hey get the word out on chemtrails people.
[09:57] <littlebird> The black ops part of the government is trying to poison and slowly kill it's population through the skies with it's chemtrail program.
[09:57] <littlebird> During clear skies, white spew planes at high altitude silently spew out long white lines of chemtrails. The first type of these trails consist of very fine aluminum particles. These dissapear from sight about as fast as normal plane contrail would. These heat up the atmosphere for better chemtrail dispersal.
[09:57] <KenSentMe> EdgeT: there's no entry for windows in grub?
[09:57] <Milos_SD> but with konqueror I can...
[09:57] <littlebird> The other ones slowly widen and disperse and eventually hit the ground giving people a whole range of respiratory problems and deadly diseases.
[09:57] <EdgeT> KenSentMe: Yeah
[09:57] <gnomefreak> dale: i think that has more to do with restricted modules package more so than upgrade but you might also need to reinstall your wireless stuff. if you are using ndiswrapper mnore than likely you will have to since i believe its not an official package
[09:57] <EdgeT> LjL: It worked for me
[09:58] <h1st0> Sierra, hrm... the version of libgpod is outdated also it appears
[09:58] <nel356> non riesco a istallare gli aggiornamenti
[09:58] <Sierra> lol

[09:58] <ubotu> nel356: Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[09:58] <bognar> anybody know how to use nvidia-glx?
[09:58] <nel356> ok grazie
[09:58] <LjL> EdgeT: without an apt-get update, and without changing "dapper" to "edgy" in the sources.list? i highly doubt it. anyway,
[09:58] <LjL> !works for me
[09:58] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[09:58] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell bognar about nvidia
[09:58] <EdgeT> bognar: Yeah, nvidia-config enable
[09:59] <worldwideserve23> hey kitche

[10:00] <Sierra> lolol
[10:00] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell GaiaX11 about upstart
[10:00] <kitche> worldwideserve23: you never pmed me you need to be registered on here to pm people

[10:01] <kitche> lsdmt: it's installed
[10:01] <EdgeT> lsdmt: Nope, ya only need to do it once, if you didn't boot from a live cd
[10:01] <GenNMX> lsdmt: This will actually install it on the computer, yes. Out of curiosity, why are you doing this?
[10:01] <lsdmt> where does it install to?

[10:02] <EdgeT> KenSentMe: thnx
[10:02] <twotone> On my list of Hardrives there is nothing for windows. Is it because windows won't work?
[10:02] <GaiaX11> gnomefreak: Upon doing an upgrade will upstart be in my system?

[10:02] <izm99> LjL, that still requires root password, right?
[10:02] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: when its done yes you will be using upstart
[10:02] <h1st0> gnomefreak, do you know if apt-get keeps a log somehwere?
[10:02] <bognar> what is the prob if i write nvidia-glx-config enable then i get message unable to load nvidia kernel driver?
[10:02] <jstarcher> can I remove the /home directory while I'm logged on and running fluxbox?

[10:02] <izm99> LjL, ok cool
[10:02] <KenSentMe> izm99: try loggin in in recovery mode and check /etc/passwd for the username
[10:03] <h1st0> gnomefreak, yeah I don't see anything in there for apt-get
[10:03] <gnomefreak> h1st0: would be a dpkg log
[10:03] <h1st0> gnomefreak, ahh poopy

[10:03] <h1st0> gnomefreak, I just installed the build-dep for gtkpod now I want ot remove allthis garbage trying to sort through it.
[10:03] <twotone> dusk: recently windows stopped working completely on my computer, I am wondering if it is because of whatever error with windows that I can't make it work.
[10:04] <gnomefreak> h1st0: the dpkg log you would need
[10:04] <rem__> ..
[10:04] <liri> is it safe to upgrade the entire system from dapper drake flight 7 to current?
[10:04] <jstarcher> can I remove the /home directory while I'm logged on and running fluxbox?
[10:04] <h1st0> gnomefreak, yeap just have to parse this data now to make it somewhat readable
[10:04] <Kim^J> liri: I would say that yes.

[10:05] <LjL> izm99, uhm, i believed it did not ask for one
[10:05] <compengi> liri, but it would be better to install it on a clean hdd
[10:05] <rem__> jstarcher, you could probably if the desktop is not loaded, in command line and not in the home directory ..
[10:05] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: it will
[10:05] <liri> im attempting to get my ati x1400 (fglrx 8.24.8) working with tvout but it just wont work
[10:05] <izm99> and the root password didn't work.
[10:05] <izm99> "Login incorrect"
[10:06] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: run the command i gave you you will be fine
[10:06] <jstarcher> LjL, Kim^J, chapium, rem_: how can I do it? I moved my files in /home to /store for now and I want to make /store into /home and get rid of the old /home
[10:06] <liri> compengi: if there's any doubt i'd rather not upgrade since everything is working fine at the moment.
[10:06] <EdgeT> KenSentMe: Brb, gonna test the changes ive made
[10:06] <LjL> GaiaX11, it then proceeds to tell you how to enable it. also, it says that method of upgrading is not recommended

[10:06] <gnomefreak> GaiaX11: as i stated before the recommended way is to use update-manager

[10:14] <izm99> jrib, ok.. can i change my default user/password from livecd?
[10:14] <javaJake> I'm getting this error: ./src/bzflag/bzflag: symbol lookup error: /home/jacob/3DModules/Mesa/lib/libGL.so.1: undefined symbol: drmOpenOnce
[10:14] <javaJake> Any ideas?
[10:14] <Flannel> izm99: default user?
[10:14] <Slim^snief^schu> oO i pressed crlt+alt+f7 and the system froze
[10:14] <noelferreira> hi people does anyone have rt61 wireless driiver working on edgy?
[10:14] <izm99> Flannel, the first user... whose password is used for "sudo"
[10:14] <javaJake> Slim^snief^schu, what card are you running?
[10:14] <prestosd> can anyone help me with a nvidia graphics problem
[10:14] <prestosd> PLEASE
[10:14] <Slim^snief^schu> elsa victory II
[10:14] <javaJake> prestosd, I can try
[10:14] <javaJake> !ask
[10:15] <prestosd> thanx!
[10:15] <LjL> !helpme
[10:15] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:15] <Slim^snief^schu> pretty old
[10:15] <prestosd> lol
[10:15] <javaJake> LjL, it was one of those
[10:15] <jrib> izm99: instead of using the livecd, just choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu
[10:15] <tuckerm> thanks guys
[10:15] <javaJake> Slim^snief^schu, OK, nvm
[10:15] <izm99> jrib, from recovery mode, I'm asked for Root password
[10:15] <poje> Is there a way to hotplug pcmcia devices in Edgy? I could do it in Dapper with "/etc/init.d/pcmciautils restart" but that doesn't work now
[10:15] <LjL> javaJake, hehe both point to the same factoid :)
[10:15] <prestosd> well i used to be able to play 3d games (Neverball etc.) but now when i click on them they crash
[10:15] <izm99> jrib, and it seems to be corrupt....
[10:15] <prestosd> i have ubuntu 6.10 (i just did a clean install)
[10:15] <chapium> prestosd: nvidia?
[10:15] <javaJake> prestosd, any output?
[10:15] <Flannel> izm99: Your first user is a member of hte admin group, being 'first' doesn't make him special, he's simply a member of the admin group.  And yes, you can change his password, would you like a howto on doing so?
[10:15] <javaJake> chapium, yea
[10:15] <prestosd> yep, NVIDIA Riva TNT
[10:16] <nlindblad> does Dapper's kernels come with HFS+ support and Mac partition style support?
[10:16] <prestosd> output?
[10:16] <javaJake> prestosd, if you run the program in the terminal, does it print anything out?
[10:16] <izm99> Flannel, I would love a howto on how to do that from a liveCD!
[10:16] <LjL> Flannel, problem seems to be that even his recovery mode asks for a password
[10:16] <chapium> prestosd: try nvidia-glx-config enable
[10:16] <prestosd> k
[10:16] <javaJake> I'm getting this error: ./src/bzflag/bzflag: symbol lookup error: /home/jacob/3DModules/Mesa/lib/libGL.so.1: undefined symbol: drmOpenOnce
[10:16] <javaJake> Anyone have any ideas?
[10:16] <chapium> nvidia-xorgconfig might hlep too
[10:16] <javaJake> I did a manual compile of Mesa, drm, and ati drivers
[10:16] <javaJake> From git
[10:16] <Flannel> izm99: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword, you'll use "Last Resort 2", and the reason your recovery console has a password is because you set a root password
[10:17] <Gamer30> where is the file that controls the startup programs?
[10:17] <Flannel> LjL: He mustve set a root password then
[10:17] <prestosd> my console errored
[10:17] <javaJake> Gamer30, For what? Bootup, or gnome?
[10:17] <Slim^snief^schu> Whats " Unable to locate RDSP" right after grub loader ?
[10:17] <Gamer30> gnome
[10:17] <izm99> Flannel, thx.  I'll report back soon.  :)
[10:17] <javaJake> Gamer30, Do you know about the "Sessions" window in System -> Preferences?
[10:17] <javaJake> Gamer30, Then select "Startup Programs" tab
[10:17] <javaJake> Gamer30, Or something like that...
[10:18] <Gamer30> i cant get into linux so i use a software in windows that can browse linux files
[10:18] <prestosd> javaJake, chapium: the console says "Couldn't find matching glx visual"
[10:18] <prestosd> when i try to run neverball
[10:18] <Ubunturookie> can someone help me to get the live cd to run
[10:18] <javaJake> prestosd, try running "export LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose" before running neverball
[10:18] <chapium> prestosd: nvidia-xconfig
[10:18] <prestosd> ????????????????????????//
[10:18] <javaJake> prestosd, LOL... we both have different ideas. :P
[10:18] <LjL> prestosd, no need to spam
[10:18] <Flannel> Gamer30: there are ext3 drivers for windows, I don't know of one off the top of my head, try googling, but that's what you're looking for (assuming your linux fs is ext3)
[10:19] <prestosd> nvidia-xconfig doesnt exist
[10:19] <chapium> prestosd: make sure you have the glx drivers, (i'm assuming you do)
[10:19] <prestosd> i have the glx LEGACY drivers
[10:19] <LjL> !ext3 | Flannel, Gamer30
[10:19] <ubotu> Flannel, Gamer30: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[10:19] <Gamer30> where is the file that controls the startup programs?
[10:19] <James> I'm completely lost trying to get my monitor/ubuntu to display 1600x1200.  It's listed in xorg.conf but not in the drop down under Screen Resolutions.  Anyone have an idea of what I can try?
[10:19] <javaJake> Gamer30, Ah, I see
[10:19] <prestosd> my card is really old
[10:19] <epp> do i need to use ndiswrapper with ar5005g? or cani use madwifi?
=== tmdca is now known as jenny_j
[10:19] <javaJake> Gamer30, OK... one moment...
[10:19] <chapium> prestosd: under add/remove applications look for this:  NVidia binary X.Org driver
[10:19] <prestosd> k....looking..............brb
[10:19] <LjL> James: try setting the correct sync ranges for your monitor in xorg.conf
[10:20] <cedric30> Someone know how to install madwifi-ng with ubuntu ??
[10:20] <javaJake> I'm getting this error: ./src/bzflag/bzflag: symbol lookup error: /home/jacob/3DModules/Mesa/lib/libGL.so.1: undefined symbol: drmOpenOnce
[10:20] <Slim^snief^schu> hm, i was able to get into gnome (abgesichert). it says some themes or sounds might not work correctly, and that the last failure was "Unable to determine the adress of the message bus ..." whats that?
[10:20] <cedric30> my monitor mode does not operate on edgy
[10:20] <javaJake> Any ideas? I compiled Mesa, drm, and ati drivers from git
[10:20] <Alazo> i've already instaled w32codecs but my video files still dont working. i need to run or install anything to make it works?
[10:20] <epp> do i need to use ndiswrapper with ar5005g? or cani use madwifi?
[10:21] <cedric30> but it was operating on drapper!!!!!
[10:21] <prestosd> AH HA!!!
[10:21] <jenny_j> Hello. I recently installed ubuntu server and trying to set up pixelpost but there seem to be some problem with the mysql-database... It take ages to load a page... Tips/Solutions?
[10:21] <Terminus> Alazo: what player are you using? totem?
[10:21] <prestosd> i have the nvidia binary x.org '
[10:21] <Alazo> Terminus, xmms
[10:21] <prestosd> legacy' driver
[10:21] <James> LjL: I ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and it reset everything to "generic"...is that going to cause a problem?
[10:21] <Yokanzo> How come I can't run ubuntu
[10:21] <Terminus> Alazo: don't anything about getting videos to play in xmms.
[10:21] <Yokanzo> I got an x800XT and the only thing that happens when I boot it up is a black screen
[10:21] <prestosd> i dont have the nvidia binary x.org driver
[10:21] <Tater> hey all went to boot up my laptop the other day and startx or KDE is complainging that it can't write to my /tmp dir but if I sudo startx everything fires up and works but I really don't want to runa s root all the time
[10:21] <poje> Yokanzo: could you be a lot more specific?
[10:21] <Alazo> but i have totem here Terminus
[10:21] <prestosd> just the legacy
[10:21] <Yokanzo> ctrl alt f1 doesnt even work
[10:21] <epp> anyone running AR5005G wireless device?
[10:21] <Alazo> i need to configure something?
[10:21] <chapium> prestosd: remove that and try the other one
[10:21] <pluma> Something's hogging my FTP socket, but I can't figure out what. My port is open, according to the port scan tool, but how can I find out what program is listening?
[10:22] <LjL> James: nope, those are just names, the system doesn't care about them. the important thing is that you select the correct settings for driver, resolution and sync ranges
[10:22] <Slim^snief^schu> hm, i was able to get into gnome (abgesichert). it says some themes or sounds might not work correctly, and that the last failure was "Unable to determine the adress of the message bus ..." whats that?
[10:22] <cedric30> up !  Driver mad wifi
[10:22] <prestosd> isnt that kinda dangerous?
[10:22] <Yokanzo> Like before I can even use ubuntu i get a black screen
[10:22] <pluma> Oops. Nevermind. I figured it out.
[10:22] <Yokanzo> neither 2 of the start options are useful to me
[10:22] <prestosd> op, cant do it
[10:22] <Terminus> Alazo: well, if you're gonnna use totem, `sudo aptitude install totem-xine totem-gstreamer_` should get most videos playing.
[10:23] <prestosd> it says that conflicting software must be removed before installing the other driver
[10:23] <prestosd> and btw
[10:23] <Terminus> !restricted | Alazo

[10:23] <epp> do i need to use ndiswrapper with ar5005g? or cani use madwifi?
[10:23] <prestosd> i have tried this before
[10:23] <javaJake> Gamer30, Sorry, I have no idea
[10:23] <prestosd> and x.org crashed
[10:23] <Gamer30> ok
[10:23] <LjL> !enter | prestosd
[10:23] <ubotu> prestosd: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[10:23] <pluma> Is there a way to restart the vsftpd service without rebooting?
[10:23] <prestosd> yah i know
[10:23] <prestosd> sorry
[10:23] <Alazo> ok i will try Terminus
[10:23] <javaJake> prestosd, I have the same annoying problem
[10:23] <prestosd> :)
[10:23] <javaJake> prestosd, with the enter key
[10:23] <javaJake> LOL
[10:23] <Alazo> Terminus, i wanna see an wmv video
[10:23] <Yokanzo> anyone know whats wrong /
[10:23] <prestosd> LOL
[10:24] <Tater> anyone know why KDE would crash and complain about not being able to write to my /tmp dir but root works fine
[10:24] <Yokanzo> why can't I use ubuntu
[10:24] <epp> do i need to use ndiswrapper with ar5005g? or cani use madwifi?
[10:24] <prestosd> oh well
[10:24] <javaJake> Alazo, I'm going to get some flaming when I say this, but Automatix2 can install codecs for you.
[10:24] <Terminus> Alazo: AFAIK, wmv9 doesn't work yet. wmv8 should play fine though.
[10:24] <LjL> !automatix
[10:24] <prestosd> ill try again later.... Thanks though! :)
[10:24] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[10:24] <epp> javaJake, yeah, i use it
[10:24] <javaJake> !automatix-isnt-that-bad
[10:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about automatix-isnt-that-bad - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:24] <javaJake> Hmmm... I should add that. :D
[10:24] <xamox> if I want something to run at boot time I should just have to put it in my rc.local file, correct?
[10:24] <LjL> or not
[10:25] <GenNMX> Tater: Sounds like something changed the permissions to /tmp, do chmod -R 777 /tmp from the console.
[10:25] <javaJake> LjL, I was kidding. :P
[10:25] <LjL> xamox, if it's not a GUI app, that's a possibility
[10:25] <UKMatt> this will sound dumb, what what programs would you use to do programming
[10:25] <LjL> UKMatt: interpreters and compilers mostly
[10:25] <cedric30>  up !  up ! Driver mad wifi
[10:25] <xamox> LjL:  Yeah, it's command line. What's the other option? it has to run as root
[10:25] <Terminus> UKMatt: a text editor like vim for writing code and gcc for the interpreter. =)
[10:25] <pluma> Okay, disregard that. I suck cocks.
[10:25] <Tater> GenNMX, will do
[10:25] <Terminus> s/interpreter/compiler/ >_<
[10:25] <LjL> xamox: another option is adding a proper script in /etc/init.d and using update-rc.d to register it
[10:25] <chapium> !language
[10:25] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:25] <epp> pluma, thats from bash.org right?
[10:26] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell xamox about boot
[10:26] <UKMatt> alright well I've only worked in Java, I know in C++ you can code it and it'll spit out a .exe, what does it do for linux?  what does it compile so that you can run
[10:26] <Terminus> UKMatt: an ELF binary.
[10:26] <UKMatt> terminus, is that executeable?
[10:26] <Yokanzo> Does ubuntu support ATI video cards?
[10:26] <LjL> UKMatt, of course
[10:26] <poje> Yokanzo: yes
[10:26] <Terminus> UKMatt: yes, it's an executable.
[10:26] <xamox> LjL:  thx!
[10:26] <Yokanzo> Then how come when I start it I just get a black screen and can't get into a terminal
[10:26] <poje> Is there a way to hotplug pcmcia devices in Edgy? I could do it in Dapper with "/etc/init.d/pcmciautils restart" but that doesn't work now
[10:27] <UKMatt> ljl, is everything you need in synaptic?
[10:27] <Tater> GenNMX, I'll try restarting X as my user and see what happens
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Terminus, but is execute bit set?
[10:27] <epp> !ati | Yokanzo
[10:27] <ubotu> Yokanzo: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:27] <poje> Yokanzo: try checking the xorg logs
[10:27] <Terminus> nolimitsoya: i don't think so. you have to set it yourself.
[10:27] <Yokanzo> no, it has nothing to do with drivers
[10:27] <LjL> UKMatt, programs on Linux are just files as they are in Windows. they use a different format though, it's called ELF (at least, that's what's normally used), while the Windows format is called PE
[10:27] <Yokanzo> the live cd gives me a black screen
[10:27] <Yokanzo> i cannot install ubuntu at all
[10:27] <LjL> UKMatt, and Linux doesn't use extensions much, so most executable files don't have an extension
[10:27] <nolimitsoya> Terminus, sorry, i gotconfused. i thought you where the person with the problem :)
[10:27] <Dreamlord> Hello
[10:28] <Terminus> nolimitsoya: lol =)
[10:28] <Ratlord> Does it come up with an X Server error message, Yokanzo?
[10:28] <j0nas`> what is the package name for MPI header files??
[10:28] <j0nas`> does anyone know?
[10:28] <Yokanzo> rat lord no
[10:28] <Yokanzo> i just have a black screen
[10:28] <Yokanzo> that won't do anything
[10:28] <javaJake> Yokanzo, run "Check CD"
[10:28] <Yokanzo> I cant do that
[10:28] <UKMatt> well i'm not advanced, I'm probably not going to be doing any big work for a while, but I kinda do some programming that just like spits out an output, nothing graphical
[10:28] <Ratlord> Oh
[10:28] <javaJake> Yokanzo, run that on the main menu... I had that and it was a CD problem
[10:28] <Yokanzo> I press "start ubuntu
[10:28] <Yokanzo> and all it is is a black screen
[10:28] <Alazo> hey Terminus
[10:28] <Alazo> worked
[10:28] <Alazo> thanks man
[10:28] <Yokanzo> after everything loads and boots its a black screen
[10:28] <UKMatt> and I need to install all the packages so that I can compile
[10:28] <javaJake> Yokanzo, Instead of Start Ubuntu, press Check CD
[10:28] <Terminus> Alazo: you're welcome. =)
[10:28] <poje> UKMatt: I suggest programming in C and using GCC to compile binaries
[10:29] <Yokanzo> oh ok
[10:29] <javaJake> Yokanzo, It is below that item you are selecting. :P
[10:29] <Yokanzo> and then what?
[10:29] <javaJake> Yokanzo, it'll let you know if the check failed or not
[10:29] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell UKMatt about compile
[10:29] <Terminus> UKMatt: `aptitude install build-essential` should install most of the stuff you need for C/C++
[10:29] <poje> UKMatt: I suggest starting with the build-essential package
[10:29] <UKMatt> poje, instead of C++>
[10:29] <Yokanzo> and if it indeed failed?
[10:29] <UKMatt> I have build essential
[10:29] <poje> UKMatt: definitely, unless you REALLY want to do C++
[10:29] <javaJake> Yokanzo, if it did, 95% chance it NEEDS to get reburned
[10:29] <LjL> UKMatt: then you can compile C and C++
[10:29] <UKMatt> well I only know Java, so I'm open to anything
[10:29] <Yokanzo> if not?
[10:29] <ademan> LjL: is it possible to build a deb around a *.run installer using the dpkg tools?
[10:29] <LjL> UKMatt: for java, you can install GCJ if it's not already installed
[10:29] <poje> UKMatt: I do C and Java on *nix
[10:29] <UKMatt> actually if I could stay with java that would be cool
[10:30] <poje> Not big deal
[10:30] <LjL> ademan: probably.
[10:30] <poje> *No big deal
[10:30] <poje> UKMatt: just go get the JDK from java.sun.com and you're good to go
[10:30] <j0nas`> i do C and Java ONLY on *nix
[10:30] <ademan> LjL: because i'm starting to think checkinstall may not be appropriate for *.run installers
[10:30] <UKMatt> poje, what's *nix, a compiler?
[10:30] <Terminus> UKMatt: the sun-java5-jdk package is also available.
[10:30] <ademan> *nix is unix linux whatever
[10:30] <ademan> generally reffers to posix compliant operating systems
[10:30] <poje> UKMatt: *nix is a family of operating systems like unix/linux/(sorta) solaris
[10:31] <ademan> ie: bsd's and linux (maybe solaris too)
[10:31] <LjL> ademan, as for being possibly, it's most probably possible - as for being easy, i doubt it
[10:31] <UKMatt> poje, gatcha
[10:31] <Alazo> Terminus, hehe another questino.. i wanna put my gDesklets opening automatically with the x.. and wanna put the weather, u know how can i do this?
[10:31] <poje> Oh yeah, and the BSDs
[10:31] <Clin1> Oh wow this room is filled
[10:31] <Terminus> Alazo: don't use gdesklets. sorry.
[10:31] <Veinor> I need some help with captive NTFS
[10:31] <Alazo> ok
[10:31] <Terminus> !captive | Veinor
[10:31] <UKMatt> terminus, how do I install that, synaptic or compile
[10:31] <ubotu> Veinor: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[10:31] <Alazo> anyone here use gDesklets? :p
[10:31] <ademan> LjL: yeah, i gotta write a *.spec file and crap like that don't i? ugh, but it would be worth it for me, i'd much rather let the package manager handle things
[10:31] <Clin1> Hey can some one help me set up the pc to share an internet connection?
[10:31] <Terminus> whoops... that used to be a captive doesn't work in ubuntu message.
[10:31] <h1st0> Alazo, once you put them in place it should add them automatically so if you restart X i believe they are there if not.  You may have to add gdesktets to System > preferences > sessions
[10:32] <ademan> Alazo: just don't use gDesklets, honestly its probably the worst desktop widgets implementation out there
[10:32] <epp> !ati | Yokanzo
[10:32] <ubotu> Yokanzo: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:32] <Terminus> UKMatt: synaptic. as much as possible, look for the app you want in the repos before trying to install manually.
[10:32] <LjL> ademan, and you'll need to write install scripts, if that .run files does anything besides copying files
[10:32] <ricky> hey everyone
[10:32] <epp> anyone running AR5005G wireless device?
[10:32] <j0nas`> lol widgets...
[10:32] <javaJake> ademan, Agreed
[10:32] <UKMatt> terminus, alright I got that, now I assume I code in just a text editor, but where do I go to compile and to run
[10:32] <Veinor> Terminus: Ah.
[10:32] <ricky> can someone tell which one is the librery for play mp3 in the konsole?
[10:33] <Terminus> UKMatt: using the command line. =)
[10:33] <j0nas`> widgets are the next greatest.......passing trend haha
[10:33] <ademan> LjL: hrm, well at least one of them seems to be prepended by a script, firefox tried to open the *.run instead of installing it and i saw a bunch of plain text (looked like a bash script) and then a whole lot of binary...
[10:33] <poje> UKMatt: write your code in blah.c, then compile with gcc -Wall blah.c -o blah, then run with ./blah
[10:33] <UKMatt> terminus, any idea of how?
[10:33] <Clin1> Hello? Is any one in here good in Networking?
[10:33] <Veinor> Can anybody help me with captive NTFS?
[10:33] <ademan> !ask
[10:33] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:33] <poje> Veinor: that's a question for the captive people, not #ubuntu
[10:33] <Clin1> :p
[10:33] <Terminus> UKMatt: simplest would be `gcc foo.c`
[10:33] <UKMatt> poje, what do you mean, like create a text doc and save it as blah.c?
[10:33] <h1st0> ricky, I belive you could use ffmpeg or possilby vlc
[10:33] <poje> UKMatt: yes :)
[10:34] <Alazo> ademan, u know any other best than gdesklets?
[10:34] <UKMatt> poje, for java
[10:34] <ricky> can someone tell me which one is the librery for play musica in the konsole?
[10:34] <Clin1> Can some one help me set up a internet relay across a wired network?
[10:34] <Terminus> ademan: !anyone would have been more appropriate. =)
[10:34] <poje> UKMatt: for java, just save your stuff as .java files and then use the jdk from sun
[10:34] <UKMatt> terminus, gcc.foo.c does the same?
[10:34] <epp> do i need to use ndiswrapper with ar5005g? or cani use madwifi?
[10:34] <ademan> Alazo: personally i just use the GNOME panel widgets for weather
[10:34] <UKMatt> poje, alright that's what I'm gonna do first since I may remember a bit of the language
[10:34] <h1st0> ricky, Are you looking for an application or the library?
[10:34] <Terminus> UKMatt: no. if the source is foo.c, you type `gcc foo.c` in the CLI
[10:35] <UKMatt> poje, any idea how I compile/run from jdk?
[10:35] <Alazo> but u get the infos from what site ademan ?
[10:35] <poje> UKMatt: cool.  if your project grows past a few files you may want to grab the ant build tool
[10:35] <ademan> UKMatt: really you should use a make system, makefiles are fairly easy, its only when you get into autoconf and automake that it gets ugly, then maybe cmake is a better solution
[10:35] <javaJake> ricky, mplayer can play music AND videos in a terminal!
[10:35] <LjL> ademan, personally i wouldn't know how to approach that. and i'm not sure it's worth the effort honestly
[10:35] <ademan> Alazo: what info?
[10:35] <K-I-L-L-E-R-D_F> hello
[10:35] <Terminus> UKMatt: if it's java, it's the same as on windows, `javac foo.java`
[10:35] <javaJake> K-I-L-L-E-R-D_F, Hey
[10:35] <Clin1> Is any one in here able to help me?
[10:35] <Panzerboy> hey all
[10:35] <poje> UKMatt: you unpack the archive they give you and then add the bin directory to your path
[10:35] <ricky> i know but before i types play name.mp3
[10:35] <Terminus> UKMatt: assuming you're using the sun-java5-jdk package...
[10:35] <UKMatt> terminus, and then that creates a file and I run that?
[10:35] <javaJake> !ask | Clin1
[10:35] <ubotu> Clin1: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:35] <UKMatt> terminus, yeah I just got it
[10:36] <Clin1> I did and no one responded
[10:36] <ricky> i wanna use the command play
[10:36] <javaJake> Clin1, Oh, sorry.
[10:36] <h1st0> ricky, before where?
[10:36] <Alazo> from the weather ademan
[10:36] <ademan> UKMatt: you may want to try KDevelop, its the best IDE on linux at the moment (well eclipse is great, but its bloated and slow)
[10:36] <Terminus> UKMatt: anything java is mostly the same as how you do it in windows.
[10:36] <poje> Like export HOME=/home/ukmatt/jdk-1.5.0_09/bin:$PATH
[10:36] <FantasticFoo> can anyone help me get my caps lock key working in ubuntu?
[10:36] <poje> ademan: eclipse >>> kdevelop
[10:36] <poje> It's large but not bloated and only slow on old machines
[10:36] <poje> ...like my laptop
[10:36] <Clin1> Can some one please help me set up my internet connection to be shaared by a windows computer?
[10:36] <h1st0> ricky, on what operating system
[10:36] <ricky> before i installed ubuntu again
[10:36] <ademan> Alazo: dunno, when you put the applet in your panel you right click and click preferences and select what location to get weather info from
[10:36] <FantasticFoo> it works perfectly fine in other operating systems, but in ubuntu the light doesn't even turn on when i press the key
[10:36] <UKMatt> poje, ohh crap I remember that
[10:37] <LjL> Clin1, you need to read about iptables
[10:37] <javaJake> Clin1, I hate to say it, but this is the worst channel for support. If you don't get an answer here, try a more specialized, less active channel.
[10:37] <ademan> poje: i'm on a 2.0 ghz pentium M and its painfully slow
[10:37] <h1st0> ricky, well I dunno possibly you created a script to launch whatever player.
[10:37] <UKMatt> poje, can you help me do that? I remember it being a pain in windows
[10:37] <Clin1> Like?
[10:37] <poje> ademan: you're definitely doing something wrong then
[10:37] <javaJake> Clin1, Well, yea...
[10:37] <javaJake> :P
[10:37] <Alazo> hm, ok ademan ... u can teach me how to put this applet?
=== Linuturk is now known as Linuturk_afk
[10:37] <UKMatt> I haven't done any programming in about 4 years so I don't remember much
[10:37] <ricky> i dunno i installed a librery but i dont remember which one
[10:37] <javaJake> !away | Linuturk_afk
[10:37] <ubotu> Linuturk_afk: Please don't use public away messages or change your nick to 'someone|away'.  We know you're away when you don't respond to messages. Also see !guidelines
[10:37] <Clin1> Jake you know how to do this
[10:37] <ademan> Alazo: right click on a panel somewhere and hit add apllet
[10:37] <Terminus> hmmm... a nat entry in ubotu would be useful.
[10:37] <ademan> Alazo: then find the weather applet, and hit add
[10:37] <javaJake> Clin1, No, unfortunately
[10:38] <poje> ademan: at work I do java dev on a 1.7ghz machine with ease (2GB RAM though, eclipse does love the RAM)
[10:38] <javaJake> Clin1, I just... er... well... learned how to use the bot. :P
[10:38] <ademan> poje: its java duh :-p
[10:38] <Clin1> darn, the fourms take to long to get an aswer
[10:38] <Veinor> So... how experimental is ntfsprogs? Are we talking 50% chance of erasure or what?
[10:38] <javaJake> Clin1, LjL just gave you an idea
[10:38] <ademan> poje: which reminds me, it wasnt quite as slow with the sun java runtime
[10:38] <ademan> but it wasnt great either
[10:38] <h1st0> ricky, perhaps you where using mplayer but just had a link to play but if you just mplayer file.mp3 should play it.
[10:38] <ademan> passable
[10:38] <javaJake> Clin1, LjL said "Clin1, you need to read about iptables"
[10:38] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: on amd64 the install ate an XP Pro on me
[10:38] <poje> ademan: eh, I never said java was the end-all, just that it's effective
[10:38] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: on five other machines, no problem
[10:38] <MikeyMike> ok i have a directory full of log files that are text.. i want to search a group of them for a sing word how would i do this? gui or terminal i dotn care.. but gui would be better
[10:38] <Clin1> I read that fourm but but it didnt work
[10:39] <MikeyMike> single word*
[10:39] <Veinor> :-/
=== mumbles-out is now known as mumbles
[10:39] <poje> MikeyMike: man grep
[10:39] <tonyyarusso> MikeyMike: 'grep word /path/to/directory/*'
[10:39] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: I would advise resizing first, starting Win again to check the filesystem, then do the install
[10:39] <MikeyMike> thank you tonyyarusso
[10:39] <Terminus> MikeyMike: grep -in 'foo' * to search all the files for foo
[10:39] <MikeyMike> i dont want to search them all though
[10:39] <cedric30> someone know how to find madwifi ng driver on ubuntu?? to make operate monitor mode ...............................................
[10:39] <ademan> poje: i really don't care for java myself, i was using it for a while, SWING is great, but as far as speed and memory, meh, but it does have the portability advantage (but seriously with open source, you just recompile...)
[10:39] <MikeyMike> i want to search a selection of them
[10:39] <MikeyMike> not all of them
[10:39] <Clin1> oh well, Thanks yall...
[10:39] <Terminus> MikeyMike: oh, the -i is ignore case and -n gives you line numbers.
[10:40] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: if you just give it a try, at least backup your data on Win, it didn't eat my disk, but it screwed up the bootloader
[10:40] <LjL> Clin1, i could give you a ready-made recipe possibly (though it's not the best idea, you should really read before trying this sort of thing), but now right now, i'm in a hurry. ping me next time you see me here perhaps
[10:40] <[sYn] > Mm.. Anyone ever done any net code in java?
[10:40] <ademan> [sYn] : java sockets?
[10:40] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: I can get to my data, but Win won't boot
[10:40] <jenny_j> Any gentlemen who want to help a woman like me?
[10:40] <ricky> can someone tell me which one is the librery for import screenshot
[10:40] <Veinor> Kingsqueak: Ah.
[10:40] <Terminus> cedric30: i don't use madwifi myself, but i believe seveas' repos has them.
[10:40] <izm99> Flannel, I think there is a typo in that LostPassword page you sent me.
[10:40] <ademan> !ask > jenny_j
[10:40] <MikeyMike> how do i search a couple of the files ?
[10:40] <MikeyMike> not all
[10:40] <[sYn] > ademan, yup, just wondering how easy/usable it is..
[10:40] <GenNMX> jenny_j: Prepare to get 1000 messages.
[10:40] <Ratlord> Lol
[10:40] <jrib> MikeyMike: list the files
[10:40] <poje> ademan: for general purpose nontrivial apps, java is my favorite.  swing is quite nice if not the best ui toolkit ever, but for multiple instance programs it's great since the VM is the source of most of the "bloat"
[10:40] <cedric30> <Terminus> Yeah but monitor mode does not operate
[10:41] <MikeyMike> jrib, list them?
[10:41] <Veinor> OMFG A WIMMUN UZING LINUX!!!111
[10:41] <jrib> MikeyMike: grep foo file1 file2 ...
[10:41] <Ratlord> Haha, Veinor
[10:41] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: we probably have a few dozen XP pro on Intel laptops at work that were all succesful Dapper dual-boot installs though
[10:41] <ladydoor> jenny_j: there aren't just men trying to help on this channel...
[10:41] <Kingsqueak> Veinor: I might just have bad luck
[10:41] <MikeyMike> jrib, ohhhhhh ok thanks man
[10:41] <izm99> Flannel, it says to mount proc-filesystem (method2) do:  mount -o bind -t  proc mnttmp/proc
[10:41] <ademan> [sYn] : well sockets arent the easiest thing to use, well when compared to a few higher level APIs, but its not terrible either
[10:41] <MikeyMike> thank you!
[10:41] <jenny_j> !ask It takes ages to load a php page on my server.
[10:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask It takes ages to load a php page on my server. - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:41] <Terminus> cedric30: well, you should fix your monitor before worrying about wifi. can't help you there though.
[10:41] <h1st0> Kingsqueak, whats wrong now?
[10:41] <Veinor> Kingsqueak: Yeah, probably.
[10:41] <Kingsqueak> h1st0: now?
[10:41] <izm99> Flannel, that gives me an error about usage.  I think there should be an extra "proc"
[10:41] <poje> ReWT_AxS: with a nice nick, too ;d
[10:41] <h1st0> ahh crapola have to go to work cya all later
[10:42] <ademan> jenny_j: are you talking about uploading php to your server? or going to a page on your server with firefox?
[10:42] <tonyyarusso> This may be a good time to remind some people about http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/
[10:42] <jenny_j> Pages which don't uses the db is very fast to load...
[10:42] <jrib> MikeyMike: your shell just expands the * to all the files in the directory (except ones that start with .), so you were listing them before too except the shell was doing the hard work
[10:42] <ReWT_AxS> Thanks poje :)
[10:42] <ricky> can someone tell me which one is the librery for import screenshot in the konsole?
[10:42] <MikeyMike> jrib, ah okay
[10:42] <Flannel> izm99: well, it's a wiki, go ahead and change it if it's erroneous
[10:42] <sproingie> anyone here use bazaar?
[10:42] <izm99> Flannel, but when I do that, it says " special device proc does not exist"
[10:42] <[sYn] > ademan, Mm.. I have a net based application to code, need to implement some TLS connections and move information as well as possible.. Trying to figure out if I should use Java (which I have used in the past) or C++
[10:42] <ademan> sproingie: i'm about to, whats your question?
[10:42] <Flannel> izm99: heh, ok, so that's not the fix, at any rate
[10:42] <poje> jenny_j: sounds like a db perf issue rather than a PHP one
[10:42] <Veinor> I've also been hearing good things about ntfs-3g... has that ever eaten anybody's hdata here?
[10:42] <jrib> izm99: you don't need that line
[10:43] <[sYn] > Veinor, Using it here.. seems to be working fine
[10:43] <ademan> [sYn] : i prefer c++ by far, but thats just personal preference, java sockets aren't any easier to use than BSD sockets or anything
[10:43] <poje> [sYn] : I'd use the one you're more comfortable/proficient in
[10:43] <izm99> jrib, yeah, just wanted to make the typo known.  and I'm curious about how to get it working, as well. :)
[10:43] <sproingie> ademan: i'm wondering if it supports a changeset approval workflow where someone commits but an admin actually checks in the changes
[10:43] <nlindblad> does the default kernel have HFS+ support along with Mac partition style?
[10:43] <jenny_j> Page loading which involves database takes ages to load. What should I do?
[10:43] <ademan> speaking of, what does linux use for networking? berkely sockets?
[10:43] <sproingie> ademan: i have an environment that requires that sort of thing (changesets get voted on and a script checks it in)
[10:43] <poje> jenny_j: look into your db's performance - unfortunately this is an ubuntu channel rather than a db one
[10:44] <therealbigusdick> (java channels are pretty easy)
[10:44] <[sYn] > poje, I don't really have a comfort zone with code, code is code to me.. I can generally code using anything.. lol Just a matter of find out which suits my needs best
[10:44] <ademan> sproingie: well it has commit hooks, so in theory if it doesnt support it you could add that kind of thing yourself
[10:44] <Terminus> jenny_j: the first step would be finding out why it's slow. =)
[10:44] <ricky> can someone tell me which one is the librery for import screeshot in the konsole?
[10:44] <poje> [sYn] : if you need a slimmer app I'd go with C++, otherwise it'd be a tossup
[10:44] <ademan> jenny_j: http://www.rafb.net/paste your php page that's slow
=== Linuturk_afk is now known as Linuturk
[10:45] <jenny_j> Terminus: There is no problems connecting to it with mysql command and nothing takes a very long time doing there.
[10:45] <[sYn] > ademan, I'm going to do some actual research tomorrow, I've been rather lazy about making the choice until now haha.. My thinking right now is the Java would be easier to cross platform, but that's simply my own assumption..?
[10:45] <jacksongnaedinge> i have a question about installing ubuntu using parallels desktop for mac
[10:45] <ademan> [sYn] : just stick to cross platform libs in c/c++ and you're fine, but that can be kinda limiting
[10:45] <jrib> izm99: it's probably supposed to be --bind instead of -o bind, but I don't know what that program is supposed to do
[10:45] <poje> [sYn] : if you're going cross-platform java could definitely be a better choice
[10:45] <jrib> s/program/command
[10:45] <Terminus> jenny_j: ok, that narrows it down i guess. SELECT statements don't take too long?
[10:46] <[sYn] > ademan / poje, Yeah.. but then again, I don't *need* it to be cross platform..
[10:46] <gpastor> how can I know if anyone else is in my wireless?
[10:46] <jenny_j> Terminius: Nope
[10:46] <jacksongnaedinge> parallels is asking what kind of linux this is, may it be kernal 2.4 or 2.6 or other
[10:46] <poje> gpastor: lick the eth ports on your router
[10:46] <izm99> jrib, I think it's supposed to be "mount -o bind -t proc /proc mnttmp/proc"  <-- that worked for me
[10:46] <ademan> poje: do you happen to be familiar with sockets and linux? what type of sockets are they?  berkely sockets? posix sockets? (is there such thing as posix sockets?) or something else?
[10:46] <jenny_j> I think it may have something to do with the connection between php and mysql.
[10:46] <[sYn] > Anyway, just thought I would get some quick thoughts while people where on the topic :).. thanks for the input :D
[10:46] <poje> And then nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure
[10:46] <izm99> jrib, but I don't have an account to login and fix
[10:46] <Gent> Oh God, Someone please help me!
[10:46] <izm99> :)
[10:46] <Terminus> jenny_j: hmmm... probably a php issue then. don't think i can help you there though.
[10:46] <Gent> gnome-settings-daemon keeps crashing at login

[10:47] <ademan> jenny ^^
[10:47] <Gent> it takes about 2 - 3 minutes literally before it finally times out
[10:47] <Veinor> Why does my wireless signal indicator in the top panel always show either full or none?
[10:47] <jrib> izm99: yeah I guess that does make sense
[10:47] <jenny_j> I have made a test page which prints a lot of php related stuff and that page is very fast to load.
[10:47] <sproingie> ademan: i'm fairly sure commit hooks won't do the trick.  i guess it's more like svn than anything else.  ah well, my environment's python, so i figured bazaar would be good since it's also python
[10:47] <sproingie> i'll mayhap take a look at git or darcs
[10:47] <elektron82> Hi everyone
[10:48] <izm99> jrib, as for what it's doing, it's just binding the proc-filesystem of the livecd to another directory, which should be your main system you've mounted and are trying to recover.  :)
[10:48] <ademan> sproingie: hrm, i dunno, i don't think having your version control the same language as your project really helps anything though :-p
[10:48] <Veinor> No matter where I check, it always says "signal strength 100%" or "signal strength 0%", never 76% or anything
[10:48] <lisette> i have ubuntu hoary hedgehog running, what is the easiest way to upgrade it to dapper?
[10:48] <Terminus> jenny_j: maybe it's a weird driver issue? or the code is too slow?
[10:48] <jenny_j> Terminius: The php app is pixelpost and I have seen it running nicely and fast so i don't think it is the php code itself.
[10:48] <ademan> sproingie: but honestly i haven't touched bazaar yet, but i hear good things, which is why i'm going to be taking a look at it very soon
[10:48] <izm99> ok, back to the problem at hand....
[10:48] <jacksongnaedinge> could someone please walk me through the installation of ubuntu using parallels desktop for Mac?
[10:48] <poje> ademan: /usr/include/sys/socket.h is an FSF file
[10:49] <Terminus> jenny_j: oh ok... weird driver issue i guess. i really don't know what's wrong. =|
[10:49] <Gent> anyone?
[10:49] <sproingie> ademan: probably not, but this is a kind of strange and fun project, all python, and i figured i'd do a lot of API-level stuff with the version control in python
[10:49] <poje> Oh, someone's tried bazaar?
[10:49] <lisette> should i first upgrade to breezy and then dapper?
[10:49] <ademan> poje: i suppose i'll take a look then :-)

[10:59] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:59] <xen> I'm trying to install Kmuddy on my Ubuntu install, but since Kmuddy is not in apt, I'm going through source (and finishing with checkinstall).  My only problem is, I don't know what deps Kmuddy has.  How can I find out?
[10:59] <pos69sum> but isn't there a way i can ps aux | grep XXX and kill -9 some audio app that is running so i can get sound back in movie player?
[11:00] <Kenotic> how can I get xvid installed on edgy
[11:00] <t3chn0b0y> i just want to say thanks to all those that brought ubuntu to my attention, its the first time gnome installed right for me, im in love with it.. windows is going by by as soon as i get tv audio working..  thanks
[11:00] <Ratlord> Hey, I have a question about X Server...I'll get an error that says it's not set up correctly, then I found this link: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=187177 <-- Where would I put that?
[11:02] <tonyyarusso> Ratlord: The commands?
[11:02] <Ratlord> Yeah

[11:03] <izm99> Flannel, jrib : I can't seem to change my passwd....  passwd returuns: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info.  password unchanged.

[11:03] <AdamKili> I need help with a ./configure problem. it says that I dont have GLIB installed, but I do. heres the pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31056/ (look at the bottom)
[11:03] <Ratlord> from a liveCD*
[11:03] <tonyyarusso> Ratlord: Ah, then no.
[11:03] <izm99> Flannel, jrib: I checked, and the /etc/passwd,group, and shadow files are present..
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> Ratlord: You should probably use the alternate CD instead.
[11:04] <tonyyarusso> !alternate
[11:04] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[11:04] <Ratlord> Ok. I'll go try the alternate CD now. Thanks
[11:04] <Kingsqueak> AdamKili: you have the -dev package of glib installed?
[11:04] <jrib> izm99: you could just make the root password  *  in /etc/shadow.  That should stop "recovery mode" from asking you for a password
[11:05] <Kingsqueak> AdamKili: i.e. libglib1.2-dev libglib2.0-dev

[11:14] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:14] <Milos_SD> I done that... and nothing happends

[11:14] <marltu> ;] 
[11:14] <Milos_SD> it's still missing :(
[11:14] <Kingsqueak> Milos_SD: nothing?  Or it updates?  Maybe you don't have your sources.list file setup
[11:14] <Milos_SD> I have sources.list

[11:15] <marltu> how can I do sudo or smth like that in X?
[11:15] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?
[11:15] <Kingsqueak> marltu: just open a terminal

[11:16] <marltu> Kingsqueak: yeah, but how can I edit some /etc/conf.conf file
[11:17] <compengi> AdamKili, what are you compiling
[11:17] <marltu> with graphical editor in X?
[11:17] <Kingsqueak> AdamKili: libtiff<whatever>-dev
[11:17] <Targ> Got some upgrades 5 of them this morning but they are not able to be authenticated are they safe to aply??
[11:17] <marltu> without using a terminal?
[11:17] <marltu> is there any Run as..?
[11:17] <jatt> roach_: does the fglrx kernel module load correctly?
[11:17] <Milos_SD> Kingsqueak, I done that

[11:17] <shawarma> Does anyone have experience with having / on LVM on top of software raid?

[11:18] <irc-user> how can I get to know a user GID of some group?
[11:18] <marltu> Kingsqueak: yeah, i know it :) but i have to remember names of graphical programs
[11:18] <marltu> to edit
[11:18] <irc-user> !gid
[11:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gid - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:18] <shawarma> irc-user: Are you a member of it?
[11:18] <marltu> ubuntu needs that function :/
[11:18] <dfgas> how do i make a startup script in /etc/init.d
[11:19] <marltu> dfgas: where's the problem?
[11:19] <irc-user>  shawarma: I have a usergroup called ntfs. I need the GID of it
[11:19] <shawarma> irc-user: Are you a member of it?
[11:19] <Kingsqueak> AdamKili: you sure libtiff*-dev is installed, do 'dpkg -l | grep tiff'
[11:19] <arup> need some help regaring mplayer, no sound in gmplayer, but mplayer runs happily
[11:19] <jrib> irc-user: get group ntfs
[11:19] <roach_> jatt:  I don't think so.  I see a lot of fglrx stuff in the Xorg.log.0 file, but it seems to end up failing.
[11:19] <dfgas> marltu, i want teamspeak server to start upon boot
[11:19] <jrib> irc-user: getent group ntfs
[11:19] <shawarma> irc-user: If you're a member of it, the "id" command is the easiest.
[11:19] <irc-user> tnx
[11:19] <roach_> and "modprobe fglrx" gives me a fatal error
[11:19] <compengi> how to check the kernel version
[11:19] <shawarma> compengi: uname -r
[11:19] <shwouchk> how do I set up a vitual host in apache?
[11:20] <marltu> dfgas: 1. pico somefile
[11:20] <marltu> you write there
[11:20] <marltu> #!/bin/sh
[11:20] <jatt> roach_: you can do a
[11:20] <jatt> find /lib/modules -name fglrx* -print
[11:20] <jatt> to check if the module is correctly installed.
[11:20] <marltu> /usr/bin/somecmd
[11:20] <marltu> chmod +x somefile
[11:20] <jatt> roach_: then you can add it to /etc/modules to get it loaded when booting
[11:20] <marltu> and it's done :)
[11:21] <jack|ass> so I just burned a fresh edgy CD and tried to install off it.  Casper fails with a "mount: mounting /cdrom on /root/cdrom failed" and then the entire thing drops to busybox.  Anyone seen it pull this?

[11:21] <marltu> /cdrom of /root/cdrom?
[11:21] <arup> any idea why gmplayer refuses to play sound, while mplayer does it fine
[11:21] <jatt> roach_: hm I remember there is another thing you need to take into account
[11:21] <marltu> *on
[11:21] <compengi> shawarma, any clue?
[11:21] <GenNMX> Grrr, the Ubuntu installer's Gnome still has the wrong monitor settings and gives me a blank screen.
[11:22] <phaedrus44> what is the realplayer for linux called?
[11:22] <phaedrus44> apt-get install ?
[11:22] <roach_> jatt:  It's in /etc/modules already (along with lp, and rtc).
[11:22] <jack|ass> marltu: *shrug* it's the installer, I figured it knows what it's doing. :)
[11:22] <marltu> apt-cache search realplayer
[11:22] <compengi> phaedrus44, it's called realplayer

[11:23] <klm-2> videos show overly 'solarized' on dapper. I guess it's a problem with the codecs. anyone know how to make the videos appear in normal colour?
[11:23] <marltu> shwouchk: a2ensite
[11:24] <jatt> I mean the fglrx drivers are installed in a location where ubuntu's xorg cannot find them
[11:24] <dfgas> is there a way to have a program startup as a certain user?
[11:24] <shawarma> thewayofzen: It's a bug in HAL.
[11:24] <shwouchk> marltu: whats that?
[11:24] <Targ> Got some upgrades 5 of them this morning but they are not able to be authenticated are they safe to aply??
[11:24] <Kingsqueak> dfgas: 'su'

[11:25] <jatt> but the fglrx drivers (from the rpm converted from alien for example) installs them in /usr/X11R6/...

[11:25] <Haous> stuck&
[11:25] <AdamKili> i have libmtp installed and it works fine
[11:25] <shwouchk> marltu: ....ok, but what IS it? it has no man page and no --help
[11:25] <epp> doers ndiswrapper work with network manager?
[11:25] <thewayofzen>  shawarmaarm: ive seen things like that in my search.  what are your opinions on the chance it might be blessed with a workaround?
[11:25] <Kingsqueak> dfgas: or just   sudo -u <user> -c <command>
[11:25] <shawarma> epp: Mostly, yes.
[11:25] <marltu> shwouchk: it adds a site into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
[11:25] <jatt> so I needed to copy them to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/
[11:25] <marltu> check that dir
[11:25] <Kingsqueak> dfgas: init scripts need to use 'su' as they are run by root, a user can use sudo
[11:25] <shawarma> thewayofzen: I've made a workaround that just needs to be uploaded.
[11:25] <jack|ass> hmmm...
[11:26] <roach_> jatt:  I did the "ln -s something /usrlib/xorg/modules dri", too...
[11:26] <marltu> shwouchk: cat /etc/apache2/README | less
[11:26] <jack|ass> Is the ubuntu loader going to spaz if /dev/hda is my cd drive?
[11:26] <shwouchk> marltu: aah, I see... but I can't figure out the proper configuration
[11:26] <thewayofzen>  shawarma: then ill wait patiently for that day :)
[11:26] <roach_> and fglrx isn't in linux-restricted-modules-common
[11:26] <shawarma> thewayofzen: Excellent.
[11:26] <shwouchk> marltu: I could as well do 'less /etc/apache2/README'

[11:31] <Katten> /opt/lampp/bin/mysql.server: 84: source: not found
[11:31] <Katten> help please
[11:31] <aSt3raL_> Kingsqueak: what?
[11:31] <jatt> roach_: you should have a drivers subdirectory with the fglrx drivers there:
[11:31] <jatt> /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fglrx_drv.o
[11:31] <jatt> /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fglrx_drv.so
[11:31] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: try 'noapic' on the boot options
[11:31] <shawarma> compengi: No idea about nvidia.
[11:31] <aSt3raL_> Kingsqueak: its the install cd
[11:31] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?
[11:31] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: oh, hmm didn't have any trouble here, amd X2
[11:32] <Rav|strangler> can someone help me get xstarted.
[11:32] <shawarma> jack|ass: which IDE would that be?
[11:32] <bruenig> Rav|strangler, do startx
[11:32] <aSt3raL_> sempron here
[11:32] <Rav|strangler> I tried to reconfigure xserver but it didnt work
[11:32] <Rav|strangler> startx returns an fatal server error
[11:32] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: what actually happens, how far do you get?
[11:32] <jack|ass> shawarma: what do you mean, which IDE?  The IDE controller on a G965?
[11:32] <Rav|strangler> :could not open default font 'fixed'
[11:32] <bruenig> Rav|strangler, you didn't back up your xorg.conf before you reconfigured?
[11:32] <aSt3raL_> it says booting the kernel and hangs
[11:32] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: do you know GRUB at all?
[11:33] <shawarma> jack|ass: Ah.. I thought you meant Integrated Development Environment. :-D
[11:33] <Rav|strangler> before I reconfigured i tried start x
[11:33] <jack|ass> shawarma: it's saying it can't find the cd drive during the boot sequence.
[11:33] <jack|ass> shawarma: hehe, nope. :)
[11:33] <aSt3raL_> Kingsqueak: yeah a little why?
[11:33] <Rav|strangler> have an ati cared
[11:33] <Katten> Can somone help me?
[11:33] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: actually no the install doesn't show it to you, on the installer it allows you to pass boot options, add 'noapic' to it
[11:33] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_:  boot: install noapic    try that
[11:33] <Rav|strangler> I had the same issue on my laptop but can't remember the resolution
[11:33] <shawarma> jack|ass: The intel chipsets are pretty well supported. I don't know of any particular issues.
[11:33] <Katten> Kingsqueak can you help me after please?
[11:34] <jack|ass> shawarma: yeah, but this is one of their new ones.
[11:34] <izm99> jrib, Kingsqueak... sorry, so what will the root password be if... say.. I'm deleting all users, and adding one.  ^.^
[11:34] <Kingsqueak> Katten: I've never fooled with that LAMP install
[11:34] <shawarma> Katten: What is your problem?
[11:34] <Kingsqueak> izm99: if the user you are adding is in the admin group, sudo will allow you to run it as that user and the password will be that user's password
[11:34] <seekiui> if I want to install the latest xchat, is it better to download the source from the website and compile, or is it better to download and compile using "sudo apt-get build-dep xchat && sudo apt-get -b source xchat" ?
=== cricht0ff is now known as cricht0n
[11:34] <izm99> Kingsqueak, awesome, thx
[11:35] <shawarma> seekiui: Why not just apt-get install xchat?
[11:35] <aSt3raL_> ok i took quiet off the boot by using other options
[11:35] <roach_> jatt:  I've got /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fglrx_drv.so
[11:35] <Katten> shawarma can you answere in private?
[11:35] <shawarma> Katten: done
[11:35] <aSt3raL_> its hanging on input:ImPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input1
[11:35] <ifireball> seekiui: apt-get source will get you the source for the package not the latest
[11:36] <freeze> how do i check if i am running AiGLX
[11:36] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: did you try 'noapic' ?
[11:36] <jatt> roach_: I am now in the dark. You already tried to paste-bin your Xorg.0.log log file?
[11:36] <aSt3raL_> no
[11:36] <aSt3raL_> i will
[11:36] <Zububwa> is there a good channel on this server for noobs who need lots of help
[11:36] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: give that a shot, mine won't boot after install without that set now
[11:36] <roach_> not yet... pasting in a minute
[11:36] <seekiui> ifireball: is that the same as if I was to sudo apt-get install xchat?
[11:36] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: I think it installed without it, but the installed kernels need it passed
[11:36] <ifireball> seekiui: however, installing the build-deps may indeed save you some time compiling
[11:36] <jedediahjohnson> Hey there guys. :)
[11:36] <seekiui> <shawarma> seekiui: Why not just apt-get install xchat? <== because i want latest version
[11:37] <freeze> how do i check if i am running AiGLX
[11:37] <Kingsqueak> seekiui: well apt-get source will only give you the same version as apt-get install
[11:37] <shawarma> seekiui: apt-get -b source xchat   doesn't build the latest version.
[11:37] <Kingsqueak> err sorry, the other guy
[11:37] <shawarma> seekiui: It fetches the one currently in Ubuntu and builds it from source.
[11:37] <Kingsqueak> shawarma: you just need to build it yourself from source then
[11:37] <seekiui> Kingsqueak: ok i get it :)  cheers!  so if I want the latest, i need to go to xchat.org and dl source and install that?
[11:37] <aSt3raL_> Kingsqueak: thanks i dont have to reinstall now
[11:37] <Kingsqueak> seekiui: yup
[11:38] <aSt3raL_> the noapic fixed the install
[11:38] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: cool
[11:38] <ifireball> seekiui: not neccesarily, depending on you config, compiling locally might yield different results then the officla package, but it will still be the version delivered in ubuntu
[11:38] <seekiui> shawarma: ok! ill get the latest from xchat,.org then
[11:38] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: don't forget to put that in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:38] <aSt3raL_> ok
[11:38] <aSt3raL_> what does it do.. do you know?
[11:38] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: another quick tip, just download firefox and put it in your home dir and run it from there...32bit
[11:38] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: it will work better with plugins
[11:39] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: honestly, I keep meaning to look it up
[11:39] <ifireball> !checkinstall > seekiui
[11:39] <aSt3raL_> 32 bit firefox2?
[11:39] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: yeah, plugins don't much like 64bit yet
[11:39] <ifireball> !checkinstall > ifireball
[11:39] <Kingsqueak> or 64bit Firefox at least
[11:39] <aSt3raL_> yeah there are none heh
[11:39] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?

[11:40] <Rolando2424> Is there a way to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy, using the Live cd, without having to format Dapper?
[11:40] <Rolando2424> I mean like an overwrite or something
[11:41] <Rolando2424> because I didn't wanted to lose the programs I have and the configs...
[11:41] <Rav|strangler> startx isn't working
[11:41] <alecjw> Rolando2424: im no expert but i think you need ot use the alternate cd instead
[11:41] <Rav|strangler> how come
[11:41] <Targ> Rolando: I read somethign about useing the cd here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrade
[11:41] <ifireball> Rolando2424: why not use the upgrade tool?
[11:41] <Rolando2424> ifireball it kind of complicated to explain
[11:41] <UKMatt> does anyone know a good tutorial site for java programming
[11:41] <Kingsqueak> aSt3raL_: seems it is an interrupt control thing
[11:42] <Rolando2424> Because it has to do with the portuguese isp
[11:42] <Rolando2424> that suck...
[11:42] <Zububwa> connect my linsys wireless-g 2.4 network adapter to my linksys network through ubuntu
[11:42] <Rolando2424> We have limited international traffic
[11:42] <alecjw> UKMatt: sun make their own tutorial. i'll try and find it for you
[11:42] <shwouchk> how come theres not manpage for anything
[11:42] <shwouchk> ?
=== cricht0n is now known as cricht0ff
[11:42] <Rolando2424> I can only make 1 gb of international downloads
[11:42] <UKMatt> alecjw, I have it, I was just wondering if there was a better one
[11:42] <GenNMX> If my monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 75Hz at 1024x768, what should my Horizontal and Vertical refresh rates be in xorg.conf?
[11:42] <UKMatt> alecjw, it's all pdf's so its kind of hard
[11:43] <roach_> jatt:  Sorry about the wait - Xorg.log.0 posted to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31068/
[11:43] <ifireball> Rolando2424: I see, but the CD you have probably does not contain newer versions to all your packages
[11:43] <shwouchk> I can't figure out how to add virtual hosts... anyone help please?
[11:43] <alecjw> sorry, don't know of any others, UKMatt
[11:43] <aSt3raL_> has anyone upgraded from 0.1.1 beryl to 0.1.2 beryl?
[11:43] <GenNMX> Ah wait, 60Hz IS the Vertical refresh rate. Nevermind.
[11:43] <rogue780> does anyone know how to convert .tivo files to something like xvid, avi, or mpeg2 under linux?
[11:44] <UKMatt> alecjw, ty anyways
[11:44] <shawarma> shwouchk: Try in #apache
[11:44] <jeoz> Edgy upgrade: downloaded, installing them in bundles; how do I eliminate from cache only those which have been installed as updates, while retaining those not yet upgraded for later installation?
[11:44] <Jimbo> how do i run a windows exe using wine....i cant make it work and im new to nix
[11:44] <izm99> jrib, Flannel, Kingsqueak : THANK YOU.  I can now login.  I have various other serious issues, but perhaps I can continue working on my school projects now.  :)
[11:44] <shwouchk> shawarma: I can't the ubuntu conf of apache is obfuscated...
[11:44] <alecjw> so does anyone know the answer to my qemu probleam?
[11:44] <roach_> jatt:  BTW, thanks for helping a total stranger and Linux/Ubuntu n00b.  :)
[11:44] <Katten> Shawarma you planing on answereing me?
[11:44] <shawarma> alecjw: Do you have full access to your /dev/lp0 ?
[11:45] <shawarma> Katten: I already did. You, however, did not reply.
[11:45] <ifireball> shwouchk: there is a readme file in /etc/apache that shuold explain to you the ubuntu way of apache...
[11:45] <alecjw> shawarma: i'm not sure. i'll check now
[11:45] <moonwatcher> hello
[11:45] <Katten> Damit i'm a n00b att this how come to you can't see what i wrote you?
[11:45] <alecjw> shawarma: it works fine with sudo. thanks
[11:45] <GenNMX> How does one write to files on the Ubuntu Live CD? I need to change its xorg.conf.
[11:45] <shawarma> Katten: Probably because you're not registered.
[11:46] <moonwatcher> i am trying to install compiz on a T42 fvu-2378
[11:46] <shawarma> Katten: /msg nickserv register some_password
[11:46] <GenNMX> Err, how does one write to files after booting from the Ubuntu Live CD? I need to change its xorg.conf.
[11:46] <moonwatcher> running apt-get update and i get a GPG ERROR: ..... no pubkey ....
[11:46] <augustin> I have error while installing libfuse2
[11:46] <moonwatcher> am i missing something?
[11:46] <shawarma> GenNMX: Just change it?
[11:46] <shwouchk> ifireball: I read it, but it doesn't help
[11:46] <augustin> apparently it can't download some ms fonts:(
[11:46] <ifireball> shwouchk: eseentialy you create a config file for your site in /etc/apache2/sites-available and enable it with "sudo a2ensite"
[11:47] <jatt> roach_: the log file looks pretty good besides the dri failure and the
[11:47] <jatt> 1042. AUDIT: Sat Nov 11 13:40:44 2006: 4581 X: client 4 rejected from local host
[11:47] <jatt> and the end
[11:47] <GenNMX> shawarma: Gives me permission denied when writing to xorg.conf.
[11:47] <shawarma> moonwatcher: Most likely you've added a non-official repository?
[11:47] <moonwatcher> yes
[11:47] <shawarma> GenNMX: You need to do it as root, just as in a normal running system.
[11:47] <rene24> Hey guys, i've got a silly newb question.  I'm reading a document that explains how to fix a problem with Edgy I'm having.  It says I have to recompile i965_dri.so with -fno-strict-aliasing.  Could somebody tell me the command to do this?  hehehe silly question I know..
[11:47] <shawarma> moonwatcher: It "just" means it cannot verify the integrity of the packages without the proper key.
[11:47] <jatt> roach_: probably you already tried this: comment out the
[11:47] <jatt> Load "dri"
[11:47] <jatt> entry in your xorg.conf?
[11:48] <moonwatcher> this: http://www.unpluggable.com/?p=59
[11:48] <Staz> I added "iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.txt" to /etc/rc.local and now ubuntu crashes on boot. Any ideas how to fix? :)
[11:48] <ifireball> shwouchk: what kind of virtual site are you trying to create? name based or IP based?
[11:48] <shwouchk> ifireball: port based
[11:48] <moonwatcher> suggests usiing: deb http://xgl.compiz.info/ edgy aiglx-edgy main-edgy
[11:48] <Rav|strangler> cab can someone help me get xserver started
[11:48] <Rav|strangler> please
[11:48] <augustin> I get this error while running apt-get install libfuse2: Error parsing proxy URL http://:8080/: Neplatn jmno stroje.
[11:48] <jatt> roach_: and add the option
[11:48] <jatt> Option		"NoAccel" "true"
[11:48] <jatt> to the device section of your xorg.conf file...
[11:48] <lnxkde> !ati
[11:48] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:48] <augustin> I get this error while running apt-get install libfuse2: Error parsing proxy URL http://:8080/: Neplatn jmno stroje. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
[11:48] <compengi> i get this error on running sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[11:48] <compengi> Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[11:48] <compengi> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[11:48] <compengi> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[11:48] <compengi> command:
[11:48] <compengi> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[11:48] <compengi> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[11:48] <compengi> from nv to nvidia.
[11:49] <Rav|strangler> I'm stuck at a login screen after installing dapper
[11:49] <Katten> Can somone tell me how to register ?
[11:49] <shawarma> augustin: Go to your GNOME network settings and set it to NOT use a proxy and start a new terminal and work from there.
[11:49] <ifireball> shwouchk: I see, well first you have to add a new listen line in the ports.conf file to make apache use your new port
[11:49] <jatt> roach_: no problem... as I said before I fought a lot with ati to get the fglrx drivers working and wasn't nice to try lots of options before it worked. At the end I am using the free drivers. Hopefully ati will fix all this mess some day.
[11:49] <shawarma> Katten: /msg nickserv register your_password
[11:49] <roach_> jatt:  Really?  Comment *out* "Load "dri""?  I hadn't tried that, actually.
[11:49] <augustin>  shawarma: tnx
[11:50] <shawarma> augustin: no problem.
[11:50] <Rav|strangler> I'm stuck at a login screen after installing dapper
[11:50] <jatt> roach_: in your log file you are getting:
[11:50] <jatt> 0886. (WW) fglrx(0): * DRI initialization failed!                  *
[11:50] <Rav|strangler> x won't start
[11:50] <shwouchk> ifireball: that might be my problem
[11:50] <ifireball> shwouchk: then cnaged the sites-availabel/default fiel to only use port 80 (change to <VirtualHost *:80>)
[11:50] <jatt> so probably it would not harm at least. I do have the same error message in my logs when I used fglrx, and as the message below says:
[11:50] <jatt> 0889. (WW) fglrx(0): * no 3D acceleration available                *
[11:50] <jatt> only 2D acceleration worked in my case too.
[11:51] <augustin>  shawarma: I don't see any proxy settings in network-admin..
[11:51] <moonwatcher> when i try : sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade i get soemthign about not being able to open /var/lib/apt/lists/lock (13 permission denied)
[11:51] <ifireball> shwouchk: I think you'll get along from now. no?
[11:51] <shawarma> augustin: System->Settings->Proxy  or something like that.
[11:51] <roach_> jatt:  so you haven't been able to get 3D acceleration working?
[11:51] <cmatheson> i tarred up a file system w/ 'tar pvcf - /' (piping it through nc), but for some the symlinks are all broken on the resulting tarball... is there some special way i need to handle those?
[11:51] <shwouchk> ifireball: yeah, did that already... I guess it was my fault... it works now, thanks!
[11:51] <jatt> roach_: I also have the option
[11:51] <jatt> Option 		"UseInternalAGPGART" "no"
[11:51] <jatt> in the device section. But actually I don't remember if it was activated or not when I tried. But may be you can give it a try
[11:52] <compengi> anyone knows why?
[11:52] <ifireball> shwouchk: n/p
[11:52] <roach_> bummer, because I was hoping to try Beryl/XGL...
[11:52] <jatt> roach_: nope, never with this card.

[11:55] <bsb001> I'm going nuts.  I'm a noob.  I had installed ubuntu with one drive, then tried to add another.  I had no luck, so I reinstalled ubuntu with both drives installed to see if it would find the second automaticly and mount it.  Again no luck.  I have checked with cfdisk, and the drive is partioned right -- set for all drive space, set as primary ext3.  Now what do I do before I can mount it?
[11:55] <m0dY> it's a SUN E250
[11:56] <cafuego> livingdaylight: Ekida *is* a voip phone
[11:56] <livingdaylight> cafuego: what do i need?
[11:56] <augustin>  shawarma: it means "Machine name not valid"
[11:56] <Rav|strangler> why wont xserver start after install
[11:56] <cafuego> livingdaylight: a voip account (or asterisk box)
[11:56] <Rav|strangler> I have a ati card
[11:56] <guerby> hi, I use xchat on Edgy but when I click on a URL the browser that is opened is konqueror whereas my normal browser is firefox, any idea on how to change this?
[11:56] <Katten> http://www.apachefriends.org/f/viewtopic.php?p=88031&sid=58f40458bfa4be32123f0dbf8556edd3    . i got this problem but i don't understand what he means because i tried was he said and i still can't fix the problem :S
[11:56] <shawarma> augustin: Yesyes, but the Proxy menu option might be called something different in Czech.
[11:56] <cafuego> livingdaylight: You can get a free account from ekiga.net I think.  I sue mine with a local asterisk install.
[11:56] <livingdaylight> cafuego, so how do 'they' hear my voice?
[11:57] <compengi> shawarma, omg it took it as ati O.o
[11:57] <augustin>  shawarma: I've already found it. There was no proxy set-up as I told before
[11:57] <roach_> jatt:  Thanks for the help.  With "# Load "dri"", I can at least modprobe fglrx w/o errors.  So I know it's not a problem with fglrx per se...  And now, for the first time, "lsmod | grep -i fglrx" actually comes back non-empty.
[11:57] <Rav|strangler> can someone please help me get xserver started
[11:57] <Rav|strangler> can someone please help me get xserver started
[11:57] <Rav|strangler> I have a ati card
[11:57] <cafuego> livingdaylight: they have a hardware phone or software phone as well (having a microphone helps if you just use Ekiga)
[11:57] <shawarma> Katten: It's a xampp problem.. Do they have a support channel?
[11:57] <Rav|strangler> why wont xserver start after install
[11:57] <cmatheson> tar should handle symlinks fine, shouldn't it?  i'm not seeing any special options for it in the manpage
[11:57] <pippobruco> hi all, someone know how to manage services using runlevel symlink?
[11:57] <roach_> jatt:  but I *still* want DRI/3D/Beryl-on-XGL, dammit!!
[11:57] <Katten> Yes they do but its totaly dead
[11:58] <livingdaylight> cafuego: so, where does one get the hardware phone
[11:58] <lullabud> Rav|strangler:  do you get an error message?
[11:58] <Katten> sha its says how to fix the problem but i just don't understand what they mean
[11:58] <shawarma> Katten: The easiest (but not very nice fix): sudo mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.orig ; sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
[11:58] <Katten> >.>
[11:58] <bgrupe> Katten: why do you use xampp? ubuntu has everything xampp has

[11:58] <lullabud> pippobruco:  yeah.
[11:58] <Katten> because i'm a beginner of linux att the age of 15
[11:58] <cafuego> livingdaylight: You buy 'em from companies that sell 'em. Note that with a hardware voip phone you will need a voip account.
[11:58] <Flannel> Katten: I agree with bgrupe, however, what did you try changing?
[11:58] <FantasticFoo> it would be kinda nice if i could use it.....

[11:58] <shawarma> m0dY: The it's probably the sparc iso.
[11:58] <pippobruco> can you open my mind?
[11:58] <lullabud> pippobruco:  /etc/rc#.d/S##service means start, /etc.rc#.d/K##service means don't start
[11:58] <Rav|strangler> lullabud,  it says could not open defualt font 'fixed'

[11:59] <Flannel> !lamp | Katten, all you need to know about setting up  LAMP
[11:59] <ubotu> Katten, all you need to know about setting up  LAMP: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[11:59] <Jimbo> you cant view a movie, print, allow access from another machine ..whats it good for?
[11:59] <ryanakca> how do you convert a .m4a to a .mp3 using command line?

[11:59] <Rav|strangler> lullabud, ati card
[11:59] <cafuego> Jimbo: You cna do all of those.
[11:59] <lullabud> Rav|strangler:  no, i mean any other error messages?
[11:59] <bsb001> I'm going nuts.  I'm a noob.  I had installed ubuntu with one drive, then tried to add another.  I had no luck, so I reinstalled ubuntu with both drives installed to see if it would find the second automaticly and mount it.  Again no luck.

[12:00] <cafuego> ryanakca: ffmpeg or transcode, probably.

[12:00] <Rav|strangler> no
[12:00] <Jimbo> it wont run an avi file
[12:00] <lisette> how do you abort apt-get dist-upgrade safely?
[12:00] <moonwatcher> shawarma: trying to install gnome-compiz-manager on edgy on a T42
[12:00] <cafuego> Jimbo: Well, blame the printer manufacturer.
[12:00] <Rav|strangler> lullabud, how do I check the log again
[12:00] <epp> i installed the nvidia drivers.  But when i start up it says X failed to start... i have to change the driver back to nv in xorg.conf. whats the problem?

[12:00] <Bogdan_kg`> no
[12:00] <Bogdan_kg`> I've just installed ubuntu
[12:00] <cafuego> Jimbo: If you need file sharing, you need to install file sharing software (samba).
[12:01] <Jimbo> catueg0...the reality is that if they want people to use this os it has to be able to do stuff mainstream
[12:01] <roach_> jatt:  Thanks again!!
