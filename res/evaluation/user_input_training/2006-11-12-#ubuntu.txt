[12:01] <Jimbo> i can see windows machines, and can see the ubuntu machine from windows but i cant access files on the ubuntu machine
[12:01] <cafuego> Jimbo: No, you're blaming Ubuntu for not supporting your hardware, it's up to the manufacturer to either release a driver or release specs.
[12:01] <Katten> ubotu i will try the link you gave me if it dosen't work i will return
[12:01] <Rav|strangler> lullabud, fatal IO error 104

[12:01] <Rav|strangler> says that on the bottom
[12:01] <Flannel> moonwatcher: close your other package managers (synaptic, apt-get, etc) and try again
[12:02] <cafuego> Jimbo: Did you enable file sharing access for the user you're trying to connect as?
[12:02] <bsb001> I'm going nuts.  I'm a noob.  I had installed ubuntu with one drive, then tried to add another.  I had no luck, so I reinstalled ubuntu with both drives installed to see if it would find the second automaticly and mount it.  Again no luck.  I have checked with cfdisk, and the drive is partioned right -- set for all drive space, set as primary ext3.  Now what do I do before I can mount it?
[12:02] <eternalswd> how do I install an X11 mouse theme?
[12:02] <Jimbo> cafuego...isnt it common practice to write appz to run on commonly used hardware?
[12:02] <Turophile> Just wondering if anyone else is being struck down by the graphviz-cairo bug?
[12:02] <shawarma> augustin: Are you sure it's not set you "use proxy" but the hostname field of the proxy is empty?
[12:02] <cafuego> Jimbo: Some manufacturers don't bother with anything that's not windows. I make it a point to not buy their hardware.
[12:02] <Jimbo> cafuego:im not sure about user enabled..this is second day messing with this
[12:03] <DJ_> PM me if anyone can help with network connction issues.
[12:03] <moonwatcher> shawarma, Flannel: now i get somethign about /var/lib/dpkg/lock being locked and permission denied
[12:03] <Bogdan_kg`> ppl, how to enter terminal configuration???
[12:03] <Bogdan_kg`> mouse troubles
[12:03] <cafuego> Jimbo: If they released specifications someone else might be able to write a driver, but often theyr efuse.. so there's nothing anyone can do about it :-(
[12:03] <Bogdan_kg`> cursor wont move

[12:05] <cafuego> Jimbo: Canon have either very bad or no drivers.

[12:05] <eternalswd> bsb001, external or internal?
[12:05] <Jimbo> cafuego: drivers for linux you mean
[12:05] <osfameron> Clin1: something like libwww-perl ?
[12:05] <Bogdan_kg`> my mouse cursor wont move, but buttons are working!!! how to make mouse move???
[12:05] <cafuego> Oh, avoid HP all-in-one
[12:05] <Bogdan_kg`> my mouse cursor wont move, but buttons are working!!! how to make mouse move???
[12:05] <cafuego> Jimbo: Yup
[12:05] <bsb001> interanl
[12:05] <Clin1> Yes
[12:05] <Clin1> but
[12:05] <teclo> Hello, in konqueror, when I look at the root directory, I only can see home media and debootstrap. How can I fix this ?
[12:05] <Veinor> Bogdan_kg`: Have you tried using a different mouse?
[12:05] <Jimbo> hp all in one sucks'
[12:05] <Clin1> it needs all the requirements in it
[12:05] <cafuego> Jimbo: Their MacOS X drivers aren't particularly flash either.
[12:05] <epp> when i run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" it says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure you have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel"
[12:05] <Jimbo> i have a canon mp810
[12:05] <Bogdan_kg`> Veinor not yet. I've installed ubuntu 30 mins ago
[12:05] <bsb001> I'm going nuts.  I'm a noob.  I had installed ubuntu with one drive, then tried to add another.  I had no luck, so I reinstalled ubuntu with both drives installed to see if it would find the second automaticly and mount it.  Again no luck.  I have checked with cfdisk, and the drive is partioned right -- set for all drive space, set as primary ext3.  Now what do I do before I can mount it?
[12:05] <eternalswd> Bogdan_kg, restart?
[12:05] <osfameron> Clin1: surely apt-get install libwww-perl should get all the requirements for you?
[12:05] <Bogdan_kg`> no
[12:06] <cafuego> Jimbo: The funny thing is, MacOS X uses the same printing system as Linux... so it's quite POSSIBLE to write drivers.
[12:06] <Clin1> OMG i forgot about that
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> etarnalswd isnt helping
[12:06] <Veinor> Bogdan_kg`: Does the mouse work on a different computer?
[12:06] <Clin1> thanks
[12:06] <cafuego> Jimbo: They just won't bother.
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> on windows it works
[12:06] <osfameron> osfameron: that or configure CPANPLUS and do it through that :-)
[12:06] <Jimbo> the canon mp810 does exellent quality with xp drivers
[12:06] <guerby> FYI sudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/bin/firefox
[12:06] <cafuego> Jimbo: Anyway, file sharing :-)
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> veinor on windows it works
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> windows xp
[12:06] <Veinor> OK, so it's a good mouse.
[12:06] <epp> when i run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" it says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure you have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel"
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> yes
[12:06] <Jimbo> k file sharing
[12:06] <osfameron> Clin1: that or configure CPANPLUS and do it through that :-) (as I appear to be talking to myself above :-)
[12:06] <eternalswd> Bogdan_kg, is it usb or ps2?
[12:06] <cafuego> Jimbo: After installing samba, you need to 1) add a user to the samba user list and 2) set the user's password.
[12:06] <Bogdan_kg`> ps2

[12:07] <eternalswd> bsb001, is your second drive a scsi?
[12:07] <compengi> i installed nvidia-glx while trying to enable the driver it says Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[12:07] <Jimbo> how do i add a user to samba list  cafuego:
[12:07] <compengi> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[12:07] <compengi> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[12:07] <compengi> command:
[12:07] <compengi> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[12:07] <compengi> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[12:07] <compengi> from nv to nvidia.

[12:08] <Katten> it says the file dose not exist :S
[12:08] <eternalswd> bsb001, is your first drive also ide?
[12:08] <cafuego> Jimbo: The reason normal system user/pass can't be automagically used because microsoft use a nonstandard way of checking passwords.
[12:08] <Targ>  Bogdan_kg`: OK well that blows that
[12:08] <Bogdan_kg`> yeah :)

[12:09] <anthonykid> pianoboy3333: where are you from? optonline is only the tristate area
[12:09] <sky123> compengi:  Do you have an entry in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for "nv"??
[12:09] <compengi> sky123, yeah
[12:09] <Clin1> Did you have it pluged in during installation?
[12:09] <Bogdan_kg`> yes
[12:09] <lullabud> compengi:  actually i didn't even read what you were writing, just noticed you were scrolling.
[12:09] <Clin1> Is the light on?
[12:09] <compengi> sky123, 	Driver		"nv"
[12:09] <Bogdan_kg`> nooooo
[12:09] <Bogdan_kg`> !
[12:09] <sky123> might be /etc/init.d/httpd
[12:09] <Bogdan_kg`> it turned off during instal...
[12:09] <bsb001> eternalswd: /dev/hda is my first drive, /dev/hdb1 is my second drive
[12:09] <Clin1> What that the problem?
[12:09] <thevenin> in /etc/ is dpkg important, what is it for
[12:10] <lullabud> compengi:  ah, that looks like the problem is exactly what it said was the problem.
[12:10] <Clin1> Is it defective?
[12:10] <Bogdan_kg`> clinl light is off, it turned off during the installation!
[12:10] <Bogdan_kg`> no
[12:10] <cafuego> thevenin: package management.
[12:10] <lullabud> compengi:  your xorg.conf file had been modified, and so the app couldn't patch it.
[12:10] <Bogdan_kg`> it works on Windows
[12:10] <cafuego> thevenin: are you trashing stuff from /etc ?
[12:10] <[sYn] > thevenin, its very needed :P
[12:10] <Clin1> Oh bad driver then
[12:10] <Clin1> or
[12:10] <sky123> compengi: make yourself a copy of the xorg.conf to xorg.conf it blows up first...then change the nc to nvidia.
[12:10] <compengi> lullabud, so how to make it work?
[12:10] <thevenin> i just wanted to know

[12:10] <Clin1> go to your mouses website
[12:10] <lullabud> compengi:  you could try `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg`
[12:11] <lullabud> compengi:  then re-try what you were doing.
[12:11] <Clin1> and look for drivers
[12:11] <Bogdan_kg`> its 7th sense mouse, no drivers
[12:11] <cafuego> thevenin: what error, specifically?

[12:18] <jordan_> hi can i ask a quick question
[12:19] <sky123> knarf`: i guess my question would be why do you want to login on localhost.....
[12:19] <lullabud> jordan_:  there are 928 people in here... i think a quick question is reasonable.
[12:19] <jordan_> ok
[12:19] <lullabud> jordan_:  i don't think asking to ask a question is reasonable though.  that makes it two questions. :P
[12:19] <jordan_> whenever i try to delete a program that comes installed on Edgy it tells me to use synaptic
[12:19] <compengi> lullabud, lol
[12:19] <sky123> !ask
[12:19] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:20] <jordan_> i open synaptic
[12:20] <jordan_> and i mark it for removal
[12:20] <compengi> lullabud, help lol

[12:21] <Bogdan_kg`> Clinl not listed there :(
[12:21] <lullabud> compengi:  just ctrl-c out of it or whatever.
[12:21] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?
[12:21] <jordan_> is that safe? deleting ubuntu-desktop
[12:21] <lullabud> jordan_:  don't worry about keeping stuff too tidy.
[12:21] <cafuego> Jimbo: np :-)
[12:21] <lullabud> jordan_:  there are dependencies between applications that you may not necessarily see.
[12:22] <compengi> sky123, can you help me with it?
[12:22] <sky123> knarf`: I believe the original question was about openssh right? if you want to export x do the following from one of the other boxes that will export X.. ssh -X user@workstation
[12:22] <whtwolf> doea anyone know where the PLF reposistory moved to for Ubuntu?
[12:22] <cafuego> Jimbo: www.linuxprinting.org  is a site you mayw ant to keep an eye on, too.
[12:22] <lullabud> jordan_:  no, that's not safe.  that'll leave you with no GUI.
[12:22] <jordan_> i thought that
[12:22] <jordan_> but i wanna delete totem because i use VLC
[12:22] <lullabud> jordan_:  looking at the size of your ubuntu install, it's probably about a gig, give or take.
[12:22] <lullabud> jordan_:  that's a hell of a lot better than vista's 8gb, so i wouldn't worry about disk space and clutter too much.
[12:22] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 not there either...not listed :(
[12:22] <sky123> compengi: sorry Im a little lost with the multiple conversations... re-state your issue again...
[12:22] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 not there either...not listed :(
[12:23] <jordan_> ok
[12:23] <jordan_> ill just remove the shortcuts xD
[12:23] <lullabud> jordan_:  good plan
[12:23] <Clin1> sworry back, not their?
[12:23] <jordan_> saying that
[12:23] <Clin1> um, hmmm
[12:23] <Bogdan_kg`> no
[12:23] <jordan_> how do i do that in GNOME? xD
[12:23] <bsb001> eternalswd: I think I got it.  Now when I go to Places->Computer  I see "file system" with 136GB free.  I assume this is my 1st 160GB drive, where ubutu is installed.  When I select the "Media" folder I see "hdb1" and it shows 146GB free.  I am assuming this is my second 160gb drive.  Why would it use 14GB to make a empty directy!?!?!?!?
[12:23] <Clin1> Did it come with a Cd?
[12:23] <compengi> sky123, i installed nvidia-glx when i want to enable it i get Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[12:23] <compengi> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[12:23] <compengi> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[12:23] <compengi> command:
[12:24] <Bogdan_kg`> did WHAT come with a cd?
[12:24] <Sierra> are there any packagers here that can help me build a .deb for the latest version of gtkpod
[12:24] <compengi> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[12:24] <Clin1> the mouse
[12:24] <Sierra> ?
[12:24] <compengi> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[12:24] <compengi> from nv to nvidia.
[12:24] <Bogdan_kg`> no
[12:24] <Bogdan_kg`> as far as i remember, no
[12:24] <Targ> What is better about Edgy
[12:24] <compengi> sky123, i changed it to nv still get same error
[12:24] <IRC> how do i change my sources to update from dapper to edgy?
[12:24] <Targ> is it faster
[12:24] <Clin1> one sec
[12:24] <Bogdan_kg`> thx
[12:24] <sky123> compengi: Id try this..and see what happens....copy xorg.conf to xorg.conf.old then change the nv to nvidia.. in the file and try again..
[12:25] <Clin1> You need to possible get Mouse Ware
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> how do I do that?
[12:25] <compengi> sky123, i've tried it but same error
[12:25] <Clin1> website
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> searc on net?
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> ok
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> thx
[12:25] <Clin1> are you on DSL?
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> cable
[12:25] <sky123> compengi: and reloading the X by doing a ctrl-alt-bkspc does nothing??
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> 2 Mbit/s
[12:25] <Clin1> they are about the same thing right?
[12:25] <sizzam> is there a trick to tile all open windows in gnome?
[12:25] <Bogdan_kg`> yeah
[12:25] <bsb001> eternalswd: You still here?
[12:25] <LabThug> OK, my dapper box lost the ability to use my wireless when I changed my router :-(.  I just put Edgy LiveCD on and it works :-D  HOw do I update my HD?  The CD only wants to "install"
[12:26] <eternalswd> bsb001, the 160GB that it is sold as is 160Billion Bytes.  What the computer reports is based on powers of 2.  ie 1KB = 1024B, 1MB = 1024KB, 1GB = 1024MB
[12:26] <Clin1> Im on dialup here so im not downloading it
[12:26] <knarf`> sky123: yes. i know about ssh -X, and x forwarding.. but when testing my setup, i'd like to do that without going a couple of miles to test my setup. original question was: how do i ssh from localhost to localhost. i guess there's a parameter setup in sshd_config that's "invalid"
[12:26] <Bogdan_kg`> :)
[12:26] <Bogdan_kg`> w8 is it a program or something?
[12:26] <Bogdan_kg`> or what?
[12:26] <Clin1> Yes its a program
[12:26] <knarf`> sky123: i only have "one box" at home ;-)
[12:26] <Bogdan_kg`> ok, w8 till i find it
[12:26] <Clin1> its to update drivers
[12:26] <Bogdan_kg`> thanks again
[12:27] <LabThug> I've mounted my HD and chrooted and mounted /proc  under that, so that chroot now has net access.  Should I just change /etc/apt/sources.lst, or is there a "Better" way to do it?
[12:27] <whtwolf> where can I find the w32 restricted drivers for ubuntu? easy ubuntu uses plf and it seems it does not work for edgy
[12:27] <sky123> knarf`: ahh...yes you are correct there is a directive...lemme look for it..
[12:27] <lullabud> LabThug:  i think you have to actually do the dist-upgrade....
[12:27] <bsb001> eternalswd: I guess that makes sense.  Ok, I think I've got it now - thanks for the help
[12:27] <LabThug> lullabud: in the chroot?
[12:27] <eternalswd> bsb001, no problem
[12:28] <lullabud> LabThug:  man, i'm not sure that'll work... sounds dangerous.
[12:28] <Jimbo> is there a way to install windows printer drivers on ubuntu using "wine"? Ive been tryin to figger it out all day with no luck. second day with this os here.
[12:28] <cafuego> Jimbo: nope
[12:28] <Jimbo> rats
[12:28] <LabThug> lullabud: how do I make the dist-upgrade affect the HD?
[12:28] <eternalswd> bsb001, if you want it to mount at boot, you need to edit your /etc/fstab file, otherwise you need to mount it manually whenever you boot.
[12:28] <flaco> Jimbo: what printer do you have
[12:29] <Jimbo> i guess since the network works maybe i can just print from windows machine
[12:29] <Clin1> Bogdan | Do you have another mouse, Im using one from Logitech
[12:29] <Bogdan_kg`> yes
[12:29] <lullabud> LabThug:  you know, i'm really not sure the best way to do that.  i'd imagine you could boot to the hd, then do apt-cdrom to load up the 6.10 repo from the cd.
[12:29] <Jimbo> flaco: canon mp810
[12:29] <Bogdan_kg`> i have 7th sense, as i said
[12:29] <pacman> Anyone know how to overclock my video card?  I've got a Radeon 9550
[12:29] <Katten> when i write sudo apt-get install apache2 in my terrminal it installs but when i try and start apache by doing sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start it says that the file dose not exist why not?
[12:29] <Jimbo> new printer just released last month
[12:29] <bsb001> eternalswd: I was about to split and just saw what you said - holy s__t I have to do more?  Ok how do I modify my /etc/fstab file?
[12:29] <cafuego> which reminds me
[12:29] <Clin1> i know but how are you moving your curser if it dont work?
[12:29] <LabThug> lullabud: hadn't thought of that excellent idea.  That's probably the best way to do it :-D  thanks!
[12:29] <lullabud> LabThug:  my completely inexperienced opinion is that's the best plan of attack.  however, i've heard terrible things about the 6.06 -> 6.10 migration.
[12:30] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 the weird thing is that the buttons ARE working...
[12:30] <cafuego> I have a tiny selphy  400
[12:30] <qubix___> anyone around? - when i run glxinfo - im getting this: qubix@qubix-sys:~$ glxinfo  - name of display: :0.0  Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[12:30] <jordan_> how do i install my Nvidia video card drivers?
[12:30] <Clin1> i know, also their may not be enough power to run the optic
[12:30] <Katten> when i write sudo apt-get install apache2 in my terrminal it installs but when i try and start apache by doing sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start it says that the file dose not exist why not?
[12:30] <Bogdan_kg`> hmmm
[12:30] <Clin1> By Pc is kiken 115
[12:30] <LabThug> hmm, maybe I should just backup /home and then reinstall
[12:30] <eternalswd> bsb001, -> gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[12:31] <lullabud> Katten:  are you on edgy or dapper?
[12:31] <sky123> knarf`: so when you do a ssh user@localhost it doesnt work??
[12:31] <Katten> edgy
[12:31] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 do u know how to run something called "terminal configuration" where I type make menuconfig ...???
[12:31] <Clin1> What is your power core set to
[12:31] <eternalswd> bsb001, use the line for your first drive as a template
[12:31] <Werdnum> does OpenVPN work with edgy?
[12:31] <jonasan> hi all: does any one what driver to use for NV20 GeForce3
[12:31] <Clin1> Ive never even herd of terminal configuration
[12:31] <lullabud> Katten:  try `sudo ls /etc/init.d/`
[12:31] <Bogdan_kg`> humgh, thats a rought translation from Serbian :(
[12:31] <lullabud> Katten:  do you see the apache2 file in there?
[12:31] <bsb001> eternalswd: Ok, let me go try that.
[12:32] <Trixsey> I can't install my Radeon X700 Mobility, I've been following all steps of the installation instructions on help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:32] <Trixsey> =[
[12:32] <Katten> No only apache-perl :S
[12:32] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 might it be something at BIOS?
[12:32] <flaco> edgy was a disaster
[12:32] <Clin1> No, if it works in windows its not
[12:32] <Bogdan_kg`> yeah u r right
[12:32] <zlack> anyone know of a tool to convert avi's to mp4 files ?
[12:32] <Clin1> Windows though has plug and play
[12:32] <Werdnum> !openvpn
[12:32] <thevenin_> i am back sorry, had a connection problem
[12:32] <Bogdan_kg`> yeah
[12:32] <Clin1> linux dont
[12:32] <ubotu> openvpn: Virtual Private Network daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.0.7-1 (edgy), package size 317 kB, installed size 948 kB
[12:32] <lullabud> zlack:  vlc will do that.
[12:32] <compengi> sky123, didn't work
[12:32] <Clin1> your mouse is plug and play if im correct
[12:33] <Bogdan_kg`> so what are we :) gonna do next, clin1 ? :)
[12:33] <compengi> sky123, i had to reboot to get out of it
[12:33] <thevenin_> who was helping me?
[12:33] <shwouchk> how do I cap the amount of space a certain directory can take?
[12:33] <Bogdan_kg`> yes it is
[12:33] <Clin1> I wonder if theirs a plug and play thing for linux
[12:33] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?
[12:33] <zlack> lullabud: thanks
[12:33] <Clin1> im seaarching
[12:33] <Bogdan_kg`> hmmm
[12:33] <Bogdan_kg`> thanks pal!
[12:33] <thevenin_> nm bbl
[12:33] <zlack> lullabud: is it in de default reps ?
[12:33] <Trixsey> How do I install my Radeon X700 under Edgy? o_O
[12:33] <Jimbo> im just full of questions...what do I need to play .avi files on ubuntu?
[12:33] <Katten> Vlc
[12:33] <lullabud> zlack:  actually, i'm not sure.  i've never used it in linux.
[12:33] <flaco> Jimbo: win32 codecs
[12:34] <sky123> compengi: that is weird....Id try and work through the entire NV how to step by step again...and see what is going on..without tracing your steps...Im not too sure what is missing.
[12:34] <flaco> Jimbo: download automatix.. the easy way
[12:34] <zlack> lullabud: ok thanks, i'll look for it - but it is around for linux
[12:34] <zlack> ?
[12:34] <lullabud> zlack:  www.videlolan.org
[12:34] <eternalswd> bsb001, you'll want to make a backup.  If you've already editted your fstab file, remove the line you added and save it to /etc/fstab_backup.  Just a tip, make it standard practice to backup files such as /etc/fstab and /etc/X11/xorg.conf when making changes.
[12:34] <Katten> Jimbo: sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-* mozilla-plugin-vlc
[12:34] <Trixsey> mplayer > VLC
[12:34] <lullabud> zlack:  yeah, it's available for *everything*
[12:34] <lullabud> zlack:  i swear you could install it on a cereal box.
[12:34] <zlack> lullabud: sweet cheers mate
[12:34] <zlack> haha
[12:34] <Jimbo> flaco: can i get win32 codecs usin synaptic?
[12:34] <zlack> milk and cereal :)
[12:34] <eviltux> omg...ubuntu rocks!
[12:35] <Katten> lulla you got any idea about my problem?
[12:35] <flaco> Jimbo: if you have e repository multiverse.. yes
[12:35] <lullabud> eviltux:  yes it does. :)
[12:35] <Bogdan_kg`> anyone else know if there is something like plug and play emulator on linux, such as on windows? my mouse isnt working ....
[12:35] <Jimbo> Katten" trying now
[12:35] <flaco> Jimbo: or you can download from mplayer website
[12:35] <lullabud> Katten:  if you don't say my whole name it doesn't paint your message yellow on my screen, then i might miss it.
[12:35] <lullabud> Katten:  what was your problem?
[12:35] <eviltux> lullabud ;)
[12:36] <sky123> Bogdan_kg`: a start would be to run dmesg and see what happens when you plug the device in and out..
[12:36] <Katten> lullabud: you asked me to look if i could find the file apache2 if i wrote sudo ls /etc/init.d/ and no i didn't
[12:36] <lullabud> Katten:  most IRC clients support tab-completion of SN's, so it's easy to type people's names.
[12:36] <pacman> Anyone know how to overclock my video card?  I've got a Radeon 9550
[12:36] <lullabud> Katten:  oh, damn.  that's weird.
[12:36] <Crescendo> How do I enable a second video card under Edgy?
[12:36] <shwouchk> how do I cap the amount of space a certain directory can take?
[12:36] <lullabud> Katten:  i'd remove it and re-install it.
[12:36] <Bogdan_kg`> sky123 what is dmesg? i am newbie
[12:36] <sky123> !dmesg
[12:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dmesg - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:36] <Katten> lullabud: sudo apt-get remove apache2 ?
[12:37] <Bogdan_kg`> a command here in irc?
[12:37] <lullabud> Katten:  yeah
[12:37] <Katten> dosen't work
[12:37] <shwouchk> sky123: type dmesg in a console
[12:37] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  it's a command in linux.  it shows system messages.
[12:37] <Katten> i have allready tried
[12:37] <Bogdan_kg`> where to type it?
[12:37] <lullabud> Katten:  did you install any other versions of apache?
[12:37] <lullabud> Katten:  and does it remove apache cleanly?
=== SmoothOp is now known as TheEcho
[12:37] <Katten> lullabud: i don't think so
[12:37] <lullabud> Katten:  edgy or dapper?
[12:37] <sky123> swouch: yeah I know how to use it.. Boddan_kg` had the question
[12:38] <Katten> lullabud: edgy
[12:38] <Bogdan_kg`> sky123 where do i type linux commands?
=== Fossil|afk is now known as Zububwa
[12:38] <thevenin> ok so should i download some packages to fix my error, i can show it again
[12:38] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  applications -> terminal
[12:38] <Katten> lol
[12:38] <eviltux> im practice my english...so if you guys read some stupid thing on my...so sorry :$
[12:38] <Bogdan_kg`> thx
[12:38] <epp> anyone good with kernel/nvidia things?
[12:38] <lullabud> Katten:  is it an upgrade or a clean install?
[12:38] <Trixsey> How do I install Radeon X700 Mobility on Ubuntu (Edgy). I'm having major problems doing so...
[12:38] <Katten> upgrade
[12:38] <sky123> Bogdan_kg`: Accesories, terminal
[12:38] <Katten> lullabud:upgrade
[12:39] <lullabud> Katten:  hmmmmm.... might be a problem with that.  there are a lot of tiny problems with upgrades. =/
[12:39] <Katten> lullabud: yea i know i heard
[12:39] <Bogdan_kg`> thx
[12:39] <sky123> Bogdan_kg`: then youll need to become familiar with lspci, lsmod, modprobe...all of which can be found on google, wikipedia..
[12:39] <lullabud> Katten:  if you don't have too much invested in your system config, you could just back up your home folder, reload, then restore your home folder.
[12:39] <tonyyarusso> shwouchk: You could check the quota package - I'm not sure if that sets caps for folders or users, or something else.  Might work
[12:40] <Bogdan_kg`> yeah, i see bunch of text here...like on marsian language :)
[12:40] <Bogdan_kg`> clin1 any hope?
[12:40] <Katten> lullabud: yea i was thinking of that... should i just stick to dapper then because i don't have the 6.10 on cd
[12:40] <Trixsey> lullabud: Do you know how to install Radeon X700 Mobility drivers on Ubuntu? Doesn't seem to work out all too well for me ^^;
[12:41] <lullabud> Katten:  honestly, i'm sticking to dapper because it works fine, and edgy has some significant differences from the more standard linux distros.
[12:41] <lullabud> Trixsey:  my experience with ati on linux is a nightmare.  i don't even bother fooling with that crap anymore.
[12:41] <Targ> dam so its not a good idea to upgrade?
[12:41] <lullabud> Trixsey:  i've had way better luck with nvidia.
[12:41] <Katten> lullabud: i got one last question if i do this how do i remove the old linux when i start my computer because i allready got 2 so a 3 will be anoying
[12:41] <compengi> sky123, frankly what i did is the following: i installed before nvidia-glx-legancy and it was working fine but i read in how to install nvidia is that nvidia-glx is the driver for my fx 5500 so what i did is that i removed the previous one and installed the new one so the problem occured
[12:42] <Trixsey> According to my xorg config I have Radeon X700 Mobility.. but the active driver is ELSA
[12:42] <Trixsey> :[
[12:42] <lullabud> Katten:  you'll have to edit the partitions manually during re-install.  re-use the existing partitions, but just have the install format them.
[12:42] <Trixsey> Someone help me get through this :(
[12:42] <Targ> how can I stop the upgrade manager from doing the upgrade
[12:42] <Katten> okej
[12:42] <Targ> its 842 files completed
[12:42] <Katten> lullabud: cya for like 25 min
[12:42] <Trixsey> Targ:  lol :P
[12:42] <Bogdan_kg`> pepople, how to enter LINUX KERNEL CONFIGURATION?
[12:42] <Targ> I've been reading some of the IRC wjhile its going
[12:42] <Targ> don't like what I see
[12:42] <Trixsey> Doubt it's all that bad? I'm on Edgy and it's about as bad as earlier versions :P
[12:42] <Trixsey> lol
[12:43] <Bogdan_kg`> pepople, how to enter LINUX KERNEL CONFIGURATION?
[12:43] <Targ> yeah but I'm new to this linux stuff
[12:43] <khaije1> loutrine: hi, fyi posted some results here -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1745308&postcount=106
[12:43] <Targ> if its got problems I wouldn't knowwhere to start
[12:43] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  are you sure you want to rebuild your kernel?
[12:43] <tonyyarusso> !kernel | Bogdan_kg`
[12:43] <ubotu> Bogdan_kg`: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[12:43] <Trixsey> You'll probably run into problems sooner or later... on either of them
[12:44] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  if so, you'll likely be better off getting help in a different room.  maybe #kernel or #linux
[12:44] <Bogdan_kg`> thx all of you
[12:44] <Bogdan_kg`> i need to rebuild it because my mouse wont work
[12:44] <azureal> is there a command to show me what tty i am in? (sorta like pwd)
[12:44] <Bogdan_kg`> and have instructions how to rebuild it to work
[12:44] <lullabud> Trixsey:  you're exactly right. =)
[12:44] <shwouchk> tonyyarusso: thanks
[12:44] <khaije1> does anyone know how to set metric on network interfaces... i'm currently using 'sudo ifmetric' on every start but theres got to be a config file i can add this to...
[12:44] <shwouchk> why doesn't ubuntu have man pages for anything?
[12:44] <lullabud> Trixsey:  but most of the problems with linux come from desktop type of actions.  it works perfectly fine as a server.
[12:44] <tonyyarusso> azureal: 'tty' looks like it might be what you want
[12:44] <Bogdan_kg`> where do I type !kernel?
[12:45] <lullabud> shwouchk:  ...i have man pages for everything.
[12:45] <thevenin> so do i
[12:45] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  you don't type that.
[12:45] <shwouchk> lullabud: weird
[12:45] <Bogdan_kg`> then how to enter it?
[12:45] <shwouchk> I have for nothing
[12:45] <azureal> tonyyarusso, thx =)
[12:45] <lullabud> Bogdan_kg`:  did you read what that line said??
[12:45] <shwouchk> maybe because its server edition?
[12:45] <lullabud> !kernel
[12:45] <whatthedeuce> Hey.  Could anyone help me get my wireless card working with Ubuntu?  It is a D-Link AirPlus DWL-650+.  lspci prints: "Network controller: Texas Instruments ACX 100 22Mbps Wireless Interface".  I followed this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/acx100 but it stopped working at the 4th step.  /lib/firmware/2.6.17-10-generic had no acx directory, and running "sudo dmesg | grep acx" gave me a lot of errors.

[12:51] <Vaske_Car> tonyyarusso, that what i need for. I have to unpack trojan, repack it to ZIP with password and send it to AV company
[12:51] <Jowi> never used it myself though
[12:52] <tonyyarusso> Vaske_Car: Ah, okay.  Then cabextract and your usual zip tools will be fine
[12:52] <lobo_nz> I just installed edgy, and need the kernel-headers but there is no package that matched the kernel, uname -r gives 2.6.15-27-386 but only 2.4.* kernel headers are available any ideas where they are or why they arent there?
[12:53] <shwouchk> Jowi: I dont...
[12:53] <xen> lobo_nz, try linux-source
[12:53] <lobo_nz> thx
[12:53] <xen> lobo_nz, err, and linux-headers
[12:53] <Bogdan_kg`> mouse: optical, normal surface, model: 7th sense ; problem; buttons work, but cursor wont move!!!
[12:53] <xen> lobo_nz, (probably the latter, for headers...)
[12:53] <Jowi> shwouchk, "sudo apt-get install manpages" will install them
[12:53] <lobo_nz> thats it, thx
[12:54] <shwouchk> Jowi: thanks
[12:54] <xen> Ok, so I installed KDE to get the deps for some KDE progs I was compiling from source.  Now Konqueror is trying to take over my system file associations....now I acknowledge that it is only doing what it's name suggests, but regardless, I want to make it stop...help?
[12:54] <kitche> xen: turn it off in knoqueror's options
[12:54] <Jowi> shwouchk, manpages-posix might also be useful
[12:55] <iCod> How do I change the default GRUB boot option?
[12:55] <shwouchk> Jowi: thanks

[12:55] <Trixsey> Jowi: I'm trying to install my ATI Radeon X700 Mobility.. but it keeps using the ELSA driver.. think you can help me out?
[12:56] <mzli> Trixsey: if you are new to linux, You can google easyubuntu, a tool for convinent install some driver.
[12:56] <Jowi> Trixsey, I have never used an ATI card so I think I would not be of any _real_ help. I would recommend you to have a look at the ubuntu wiki page for ati though
[12:57] <Jowi> !ati
[12:57] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[01:00] <seb--> i can't find tcsh (new shell) package on ubuntu?!?
[01:00] <seb--> what gives?
[01:00] <mzli> seb--: apt-get it.
[01:00] <crimsun> !info tcsh

[01:00] <seb--> n/m....looks like my last apt-get update/upgrade put it in databse :)
[01:01] <seb--> mzli: normal for ubuntu install to blank out towards the end before the reboot?
[01:02] <mzli> seb--: if you have install it. just put tcsh, You will convert to tcsh.
[01:02] <xen> and uninstalling konqueror seems like its going to take most of KDE with it...
[01:03] <seb--> mzli: i thought install crashed since looked frozen...but after rebooted all was fine!?
[01:03] <lsdmt> anybody got a helpful how-to on mounting a sata drive that ubuntu doesn't see?
[01:03] <knarf`> sky123: ssh user@localhost worked, but ssh user@ip don't. strange. anyway, thanks!
[01:04] <mzli> seb--: it maybe not so fine as you see. It may contain some problem you will met.
[01:04] <tRiNcHeTa> topic
[01:04] <mzli> seb--: but maybe You will not even the possiblity is low.
[01:04] <nblracer> i have an issue with the package manger, every time i install or update it says this file should be owned by root and in tmp file
[01:04] <Jowi> lsdmt, does "sudo fdisk -l" list it for you?
[01:04] <lullabud> nblracer:  even after reboot?
[01:05] <nblracer> yes
[01:05] <seb--> ANYONE notice background processes work differently in Ubuntu? killing the xterm 'parent' kills the background child process!?!?
[01:05] <lullabud> nblracer:  try `chown -R root /tmp/*`
[01:05] <nblracer> lullabud i also get i cant use the auto update, it says it already running when it is not
[01:05] <nblracer> k
[01:05] <lullabud> seb--:  that behavior is pretty standard.
[01:06] <lullabud> seb--:  unless processes are programmed to ignore HUP signals, they should die when the parent dies.
[01:06] <seb--> lullabud: on debian i could do 'xmms & ; exit'
[01:06] <seb--> lullabud: thanks btw
[01:06] <lullabud> seb--:  that might be an xmms compile-time option.  or perhaps even a preference.
[01:06] <MarcN> seb--: use   (nohup xmms&)
[01:06] <lsdmt> Jowi, it does not list it
[01:07] <lullabud> seb--:  you could do alt-f2 xmms
[01:07] <seb--> MarcN: nice!
[01:07] <lullabud> seb--:  or you could do `nohup xmms & ; exit`
[01:07] <lullabud> seb--:  the problem with nohup is you'll end up with a nohup file with all the output.
[01:07] <seb--> ah
[01:08] <seeeking33> does anyone know of any IRC clients or IRC websites where I can log unto IRC under a different IP address?
[01:08] <seb--> lullabud: what does the Alt-f2 do?
[01:08] <seb--> seeeking: Tor
[01:08] <lullabud> seb--:  honestly, nohup is kinda of deprecated.  anything that needs to ignore hup should have a background or daemon option, and anything you need to interact with should be run within `screen`
[01:08] <seb--> seeeking: BitchX
[01:08] <lullabud> seb--:  alt-ft, in gnome and kde, opens a run dialog box.
[01:08] <seb--> seeek: tell more what your problem is
[01:08] <lullabud> seb--:  *alt-f2
[01:08] <jordan_> how can i check if my graphics card drivers are installed?
[01:08] <nblracer> lullabud i still get that the file should be ownd by root.root
[01:09] <seb--> jordan: lsmod
[01:09] <lullabud> nblracer:  does it say which file?
[01:09] <lullabud> nblracer:  have you tried `sudo rm -rf /tmp/*` ?
[01:09] <nblracer> hmm
[01:09] <nblracer> no
[01:09] <nblracer> should i try that
[01:09] <lsdmt> Jowi, you have any idea how to mount it if it doesn't show up in sudo fdisk -l
[01:09] <lullabud> nblracer:  i'd do it.
[01:09] <lullabud> nblracer:  they're all temp files anyways. :P
[01:10] <seb--> lullabud: k, thanks again
[01:10] <Jowi> lsdmt, not really. can you see if it is listed in hal-device-manager? if it does not show up there it means that either A. it is not connected properly or B. the driver is not loaded (how is it connected?)
[01:11] <jordan_> what am i looking for in lsmod?
[01:12] <bipinu2> channel, just installed 6.10 in my HP dv 5000.. sound volume is very very low help !

[01:13] <jrib> nblracer: don't deelte /tmp*
[01:13] <nblracer> too late :(
[01:13] <knarf`> Regarding X/ssh forwarding: I've setup sshd_config to forward X, but fail. after "ssh -X user@localhost" i try to run xterm, and it complain about the DISPLAY not set. echo $DISPLAY shows no output. Shouldn't ssh setup this automatically, or do I have to setup this myself?
[01:13] <MarcN> bipinu2: open the volume applet and increase pcm
=== seeeking33 is now known as JamesPurser
[01:14] <bipinu2> MarcN, all set to maximum.. still low
[01:14] <ompaul> bipinu2, double click on the picture of a speaker and add more features, and configure them, including the capture and output
[01:14] <MarcN> nblracer: you may want to logout/in again -- /tmp has some stuff needed for gnome/kde session stuff
[01:14] <lullabud> nblracer:  it's a java problem?  oh groan.
[01:14] <ompaul> bipinu2, ehh does your external speaker have an external  volume control?
[01:14] <lullabud> nblracer:  it wasn't even a problem with an existing file.  it's telling you to download those files, then chown them to root.
[01:14] <SpaceFrog> hey guys
[01:14] <bluefox83> ok..i am having issues getting a new logitech quickcam express working O.o

[01:15] <bipinu2> ompaul, i have only volume and in gain properties
[01:15] <nblracer> lullabud i get that on anything i install
[01:15] <MarcN> bipinu2: look at file -> change device and make sure alsa is selected.
[01:15] <lullabud> nblracer:  how are you installing it?
[01:15] <ompaul> bipinu2, try clicking on edit - does it give you more options?

[01:16] <ompaul> !nickspam | seeking35
[01:16] <ubotu> seeking35: changing your nick in a busy channel like #ubuntu can get you removed - it causes unrequired scrolling which is unfair on new users, the same goes for using noisy away see (/msg ubotu away) for more details "/away reason" sets your client away silently, thanks
[01:16] <bipinu2> MarcN, it has only PCM and volume option..
[01:16] <lullabud> nblracer:  can you try doing apt-get install on something, then if you have a problem paste that into the pastebin?
[01:16] <nblracer> ok
[01:17] <bipinu2> bipinu2, is something wrong with the sound driver? do i need to add any other packages?
[01:17] <seeking35> ompaul: ok
[01:17] <bipinu2> MarcN, ompaul  is something wrong with the sound driver? do i need to add any other packages?
[01:17] <PacketScan> nblracer, bmx for life.
[01:17] <MarcN> bipinu2: open the volume applet and look at preferences.  Should let you 'select tracks' -- Master, Headphone, PCM, Line-In, etc.  If not checked, they aren't displayed.
[01:18] <nblracer> lol thanks PacketScan
[01:18] <lullabud> man, remember that movie bmx bandits?
[01:18] <MarcN> bipinu2: doubt it.  probably just volume control set too low.
[01:18] <Megaqwerty> What startup script is (System>Preferences>Sessions>Startup Programs) Altering?
[01:18] <bipinu2> MarcN, that's what i am surpsised.. i cannot see those options. insdie prefreces

[01:18] <bipinu2> MarcN, it's set to max
[01:19] <bipinu2> MarcN, in dell machines it's fine.. in this HP DV 5000 very low sound.. but the hell windows gives  too loud
[01:19] <MarcN> bipinu2: right click on the volume applet, select open volume control.   Then select Edit->Preferences and get a listbox.
[01:20] <Majic> Okay, I don't know much about Ubuntu.  How do I get it to stop showing the recent documents I've worked on?  Under the Places menu?
[01:20] <bipinu2> MarcN, the list box has only Master, PCM and Capture
[01:20] <bipinu2> MarcN, and all set to Max
[01:20] <Megaqwerty> does anyone know? ^^
[01:21] <Jowi> Majic, edit the file /home/yourname/.recently-used and delete everything in it and save it. then in a terminal type "chmod a-w .recently-used"
[01:21] <bipinu2> MarcN, my doubt is i need to add some extra packages for my soudn card
[01:21] <Jowi> Majic, that makes the file write protected

[01:30] <jbroome> nope, i rane out of clues
[01:31] <Admiral_Buttercr> terminal*
[01:31] <jbroome> !pastebin
[01:31] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[01:31] <Pelo> paragonc,  not sure , I got it from a site,  let me look for it
[01:31] <lullabud> what does glxinfo say?
[01:31] <lullabud> Admiral_Buttercr:  if you're going to do that, use pastebin...
[01:31] <TGPO> bah, I just added KDE for my wife and Konqueror took over as default web browser in fluxbox
[01:32] <Admiral_Buttercr> here is what my terminal says http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31097/plain/
[01:32] <lullabud> ...why are you grepping for rendering?
[01:33] <ompaul> Admiral_Buttercr, you are in the wrong channel, please join #ubuntu-xgl
[01:33] <Admiral_Buttercr> to turn on open GL
[01:33] <Admiral_Buttercr> thanks
[01:33] <paragonc> anyone uses Storage Device Manager ?
[01:33] <lullabud> Admiral_Buttercr:  right...  grep is unnecessary there.  anyhow, it looks like the driver isn't loaded properly.
[01:33] <Jowi> TGPO, try "sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser" and selet what you want there
[01:33] <b33r-> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31098/ can u tell me why I'm getting this when I try to compile x-chat?
[01:33] <TGPO> Jowi 1 se and it shall be done
[01:34] <Admiral_Buttercr> what was that cannel again, i left and i failed to copy it
[01:34] <kitche> lullabud: it makes it easier to find rendering in glxinfo output
[01:34] <ompaul> Admiral_Buttercr,  #ubuntu-xgl
[01:34] <Admiral_Buttercr> ty again
[01:34] <ompaul> Admiral_Buttercr, just click on it
[01:34] <lullabud> kitche:  yes, i'm sure it does, but none of those lines even contained the string "rendering"
[01:34] <ompaul> (in most cases)
[01:34] <Megaqwerty> What startup script is (System>Preferences>Sessions>Startup Programs) Altering?
[01:35] <lullabud> kitche:  those lines are probably from stderr, not sdout
[01:35] <dylan_> Does anyone know the "cheat code" for safe graphics mode
[01:35] <dylan_> when you load the cd?

[01:40] <marltu> b33r-: why are you compiling it?
[01:40] <Jowi> b33r-, why don't you install xchat from the repos? and if you need to recompile it you can you "apt-get source".
[01:40] <marltu> apt-get install x-chat
[01:40] <Jowi> s/you/use
[01:41] <katten> lullabud: so step one is sudo apt-get install apache2 ?

[01:41] <marltu> apt-get update
[01:41] <b33r-> k thanks soz I'm dumb :(

[01:50] <bluefox83> bruenig, uh..yeah that

[01:55] <bruenig> what is this google you speak of?
[01:55] <neobyte420> i was running a DHCP server and its not giving any of my clients there dhcp address
[01:55] <TGPO> livingdaylight, how about tight clicking on the bar and adding volume control to the bar
[01:55] <neobyte420> or the clients are not taking them
[01:55] <lullabud> bruenig:  it's a candy made out of rice.

[01:56] <max_> hi, i tried to install mandriva(kde) on my desktop, and after i booted up i cant use my mouse, anyone know how i can fix this problem....i came in here cause i thought maybe someone could help, no one responding to me in #mandriva
[01:56] <Pelo> max_,  this is the ubuntu channel not the mandriva one
[01:56] <lullabud> max_:  you installed a different OS on top of ubuntu?
[01:56] <lullabud> *distro
[01:56] <max_> lullabud: no, i reformatted
[01:56] <livingdaylight> TGPO: volume control from 'add panel' is just a +/- volume setting, nothing like Volume Control
[01:57] <therealbigusdick> what's wrong with mandriva?
[01:57] <max_> Pelo: i just said no one responding in mandriva
[01:57] <lullabud> max_:  so you're in mandriva right now?
[01:57] <max_> no, im on my winduhs laptop
[01:57] <max_> i cant use my moise
[01:57] <max_> mouse*
[01:57] <lullabud> max_:  first step is to put in the ubuntu 6.06.1 installer cd, then you reboot and when you get to the desktop double-click "install"
[01:57] <Pelo> max_,  still a problem for the #mandriva ppl ,  go back to their channel and be patient
[01:57] <TGPO> livingdaylight, I cant help with that, I can just tell you what I use
[01:58] <livingdaylight> TGPO: ok, so where is wmmixer?
[01:58] <max_> lullabud: haha,
[01:58] <bruenig> lullabud, you mean 6.10
[01:58] <TGPO> in repo
[01:58] <lullabud> max_:  seriously though, this is a question for mandirava people.  you're using kde in mandriva.  we all use gnome in ubuntu.  totally different.
[01:58] <TGPO> livingdaylight, in repo, you'll have to install it
[01:58] <lullabud> bruenig:  no, 6.06.1
[01:58] <bruenig> I use xfce in xubuntu
[01:59] <max_> you dont all use gnome in ubuntu
[01:59] <livingdaylight> TGPO: i did: sudo apt-get install wmmixer
[01:59] <lullabud> bruenig:  isn't there an xubuntu channel?
[01:59] <bruenig> 6.10 is so much better unless you are incompetent and can't use it and need your safe little dapper to console you
[01:59] <lullabud> max_:  true... i don't use any gui.
[01:59] <therealbigusdick> what does the second 0 in root            (hd0,0) in grub menu.lst mean?
[01:59] <max_> before i installed mandriva i used kubuntu in ubuntu
[01:59] <lullabud> bruenig:  or unless you're running a server farm in a production web hosting environment and need 5 years of no platform changes.
[01:59] <bruenig> lullabud, yeah, but most of the people in there know what they are doing, the newbs come in here. So I can generally be of more help in here
[02:00] <TGPO> livingdaylight, you'll have to manually start it, run the app or do it from command line
[02:00] <therealbigusdick> what does the second 0 in root            (hd0,0) in grub menu.lst mean?
[02:00] <livingdaylight> TGPO: its tiny. like 1sq cm?
[02:00] <lullabud> therealbigusdick:  that's the partition.
[02:01] <TGPO> livingdaylight, is it on a panel?
[02:01] <livingdaylight> TGPO: no
[02:01] <therealbigusdick> lullabud, so if I do have hda4 and I want to boot a kernel in that partition do I need to specify (hd0,3)?
[02:01] <bruenig> lullabud, excuses excuses
[02:01] <livingdaylight> TGPO: does it cover mic?
[02:01] <lullabud> bruenig:  haha =)
[02:01] <TGPO> livingdaylight, yes
[02:02] <lullabud> therealbigusdick:  yup
[02:02] <fiveiron> has the way of identifying a TV output on a video card changed with edgy?

[02:02] <PDani> hi
[02:02] <livingdaylight> TGPO: sorry, but that is completely unusable
[02:02] <PDani> i have a problem with firefox: when i log out from my xfce (saving the session) with a running firefox, at the next time i log in, everything restore fine except firefox. and when i start it by hand, it complains about some crash, and session recovery... is there a workaround to get these session-related stuff work properly?

[02:03] <Trixsey> Hey boys and girls. If I want to uninstall part of a software bundle, and keep the other part... is it possible?
[02:03] <Trixsey> I think Ubuntu comes with some unnessecary things :P
[02:04] <lullabud> Trixsey:  if you try to uninstall an app and it says you need to uninstall a whole big list of other things that you want to keep, you're best just keeping the app.
[02:04] <therealbigusdick> Trixsey, yes it is possible to uninstall unnecessary things in ubuntu
[02:04] <Pelo> Trixsey,  you can easily remove stuff you donT' want after the install
[02:04] <katten> how do i change permission of a folder because when i write 'sudo chmod 644 /var/www/ -r' nothing happens
[02:04] <therealbigusdick> katten, -R
[02:04] <iKs> Trixsey: What do you think is useless in Ubuntu ? :p
[02:04] <lullabud> katten:  you have to use a capital -R in chmod because -r means "take away read privs"
[02:04] <therealbigusdick> -R  changes the permissions of the folder and all of its contents
[02:04] <katten> still dosen't work :S
[02:05] <livingdaylight> anyone know about Volume Control?
[02:05] <katten> chmod 644 /var/www/ -R
[02:05] <fiveiron> it controls your volume

[02:05] <therealbigusdick> chmod -R 644 /var/www doesn't work?
[02:05] <iKs> katten: What permission do you want to put exactly ?
[02:05] <Trixsey> iKs: For instance, if you prefer Thunderbird rather than Evolution Mail, you should be able to ditch only Evolution Mail

[02:07] <crimsun> Trixsey: what are you using to remove packages? Synaptic and aptitude handle dependencies intelligently.
[02:07] <Trixsey> I have 100% no use of that, since I don't even have a floppy
[02:07] <Trixsey> :[
[02:07] <iKs> Trixsey: do you have really little space on your HD ?
[02:07] <Trixsey> I tried add/remove programs and synaptic
[02:07] <crimsun> Trixsey: then use apt-get
[02:07] <Pelo> livingdaylight,  you problem is not volume control,  go  and search for turning on the microphone in the forum
[02:07] <Targ> Ok I know this has been asked before today so sorry for repeating it ... but I thought I had it straight how do I install the Nvidia Drivers for my 6600 vid
[02:07] <crimsun> livingdaylight: what's the issue?
[02:07] <Trixsey> Try removing the floppy formatter, synaptic will suggest removal of ubuntu-desktop
[02:07] <Trixsey> ^^;
[02:08] <iKs> Well it doesnt really matter
[02:08] <livingdaylight> Pelo: my problem is i can't get volume control
[02:08] <cornell> Hi...  Installing ubuntu server, first question, if I take the first option, install on harddrive, does that include LAMP?
[02:08] <therealbigusdick> Trixsey, you can remove ubuntu-desktop, it is a virtual package to help upgrades
[02:08] <katten> lullabud: still not
[02:08] <Trixsey> I want parts of ubuntu-desktop though :(
[02:08] <Trixsey> lol
[02:08] <iKs> Trixsey: it does matter for upgrades but otherwise removing ubuntu-desktop will work just fine ;)
[02:08] <lullabud> katten:  oops... two syntax problems in those lines.  the first should be "chmod 775"
[02:08] <jomino> Trixsey, then remove it with aptitude and without the recommendations
[02:08] <dynamo> cornell, no
[02:08] <therealbigusdick> Trixsey, yes but removing ubuntu-desktop will not remove the other parts
[02:08] <livingdaylight> crimsun: I've installed Volume Control from Synaptic and i've got it ticked in ADD/REmove programs but its not in my menu
[02:08] <ivx> fiveiron, do i have to run the windows version of firefox to get it
[02:08] <lullabud> katten:  the second should be "sudo chmod" not simply "chmod"
[02:08] <jneves> anyone knows how to put psql using ssl to communicate with a postgresql server?
[02:09] <iKs> Trixsey: ubuntu-desktop is only a meta package, doesnt contain anything itself
[02:09] <crimsun> what in the world is "Volume Control"?
[02:09] <lullabud> katten:  what's it saying?  if it's not saying anything it's probably still working.  it won't come back instantaneously if you have lot's of files in there.
[02:09] <cornell> dynamo, if I choose the second option, to install a LAMP server, is LAMP the only services installed?
[02:09] <vasP_L> anyone know why I get "segmentation fault" whenever I try to run an OpenGL app or glxinfo? [latest nvidia drivers on 6.10] 
[02:09] <dynamo> crimsun, prog to adjust the sound volume
[02:09] <crimsun> dynamo: the applet from gnome-media?
[02:09] <fiveiron> ivx, you have to manually install it  ... there is a precompiled binary on one of the nvidia blogs that you put in your firefox plugins directory, I dont know the site you get it from.  google
[02:09] <dynamo> for example yes
[02:10] <livingdaylight> crimsun: huh? volume control is where you control volume of mic, left and right speakers, 'surround' etc
[02:10] <katten> lullabud: i got lost in the constant message can you tell me what to write again?
[02:10] <crimsun> dynamo: why would that need to be installed separately? It's distributed with Ubuntu.
[02:10] <DualCortex> Anyone know how to turn a PNG image into PNG-16 color in GIMP?
[02:10] <livingdaylight> crimsun: check ADD/remove programs under Sound
[02:10] <crimsun> livingdaylight: I don't use GNOME, hence why I'm asking.
=== joshman is now known as zoop
[02:10] <katten> lullabud: i got lost in the constant message can you tell me what to write again?
=== zoop is now known as zoopssss
[02:10] <lullabud> katten:  `sudo find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 775 "{}" \;`
[02:10] <dynamo> except when you installed the server form
[02:10] <livingdaylight> Anyone using GNOME know why i might not be getitng Volume Control?
[02:11] <madman91> WHY cant i boot my old fedora root partition.. i make the dir ... i mount it with ... mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/yes -t ext3 .... and it says its busy or already mounted... so i unmount... "not mounted" ... i try a new dir i just made (no, i'm not in it ..) and nothing
[02:11] <crimsun> livingdaylight: is your sound card detected at all?
[02:11] <livingdaylight> crimsun: great...
[02:11] <katten> lullabud: ffs still nothing
[02:11] <livingdaylight> crimsun: i've got sound
[02:11] <Targ> Ok I know this has been asked before today so sorry for repeating it ... but I thought I had it straight how do I install the Nvidia Drivers for my 6600 vid
[02:11] <dynamo> madman91, you mean boot, or mount?
[02:11] <madman91> dynamo, sorry... mount
[02:12] <lullabud> katten:  `sudo find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 664 "{}" \;`
[02:12] <madman91> dynamo, its my 3rd time typing this today.. no response so far
[02:12] <Pelo> !nvidia | Targ
[02:12] <ubotu> Targ: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:12] <habeeb> Hello, its a thread in board I have to follow, but I also have to sleep. Is there a way to save this thread every, lets say, 10minutes while I'm sleeping?
[02:12] <jvai> livingdaylight.. try the hardware sound control 1st, then the software control
[02:12] <katten> lullabud: ffs still nothing
[02:12] <lullabud> lullabud:  ffs?
[02:12] <crimsun> livingdaylight: so you're saying you don't have the volume icon in the upper right corner?
[02:12] <dynamo> look in /media if it isn't mounted there yet, the command mount gives a view of all mounted thingies
[02:12] <knix> Is there a file that performs the opposite of /etc/modules? Or a way to stop the kernel from loading a certain module at startup?
[02:12] <lullabud> lullabud:  what is it saying?  if it's saying nothing then it worked.
[02:12] <madman91> dynamo, its not mounted
[02:13] <livingdaylight> jvai: i need volume control so i can set my mic so i can use voip
[02:13] <lullabud> oops... i just typed to myself.  i think i need some food...
[02:13] <lullabud> katten:  what's it saying?  if it's saying nothing then it worked.
[02:13] <katten> lullabud: nothing happend if i right click properties permission its till root only -.-
[02:13] <dynamo> try sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/adiryoumade
[02:13] <lullabud> katten:  do `find /var/www -ls` and paste the output into a pastebin
[02:13] <dynamo> and try hda2 and so on
[02:13] <crimsun> livingdaylight: remember you can use other mixer apps like alsamixer, alsamixer-gui, amixer, etc.
[02:13] <katten> lullabud: what is a pastebin?
[02:13] <lullabud> !pastebin
[02:13] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[02:13] <jvai> livingdaylight: right clik on the top panel, sellect "add to panel" then place the volume control where ever u want it to be
[02:13] <iKs> lullabud: Did you do chmod 644 ? oO
[02:14] <iKs> lullabud: cause if you did and the owner is root then it absolutely normal to have an only root access...
[02:14] <lullabud> iKs:  did i?  i meant 664.
[02:14] <iKs> ok sorry
[02:14] <livingdaylight> jvai: that is a sucky little thing that only does +/- on volume. I need the whole graphical equaliser
[02:14] <slinky_> I want to install the newest version of Rhythmbox Music Player 0.9.6, my current version is 0.9.3.1 but Synaptic will not allow me to do a "Force Version", what Repository entry do I need to add to obtain the newest version?
[02:14] <lullabud> i really need some food... too many typos for syntactically specific actions.
[02:14] <iKs> lullabud: well it's the same ! the group is supposed to be root isn't it ?
[02:15] <katten> Iks: what shall i write if i want my normal user to be able to change stuff inside that folder then?
[02:15] <fiveiron> anyone have a separate screen defined for TV out?
[02:15] <lullabud> iKs:  depends.  i make it apache.
[02:15] <iKs> you shoul, or change the owner, or change the gorup or set the chmod to 777
[02:15] <lullabud> iKs:  definitely not 777!
[02:15] <jvai> livingdaylight: "SYSTEMS-PREFERENCES-SOUND"  for more fine tuned control
[02:15] <livingdaylight> crimsun: alsamixer-gui doens't install, what else?
[02:15] <iKs> lullabud: Well it's defnitely not secure but it's a way...
[02:16] <lullabud> iKs:  using windows is insecure and a way too. :P
[02:16] <iKs> lullabud: >_<
[02:16] <dynamo> lol
[02:16] <livingdaylight> I wish someone could just explain why volume control don't work in edgy. Always did in Dapper
[02:16] <iKs> livingdaylight: are you sure the volume control doesn't work ? is it not your sound card that's not detected ?
[02:16] <jvai> oooo u r on edgy
[02:17] <jvai> edgy is still.... edghy
[02:17] <katten> so can somone answere my quest :O?
[02:17] <katten> what shall i write
[02:17] <dynamo> livingdaylight, try aumix in console
[02:17] <iKs> jvai: I didn't have any problem on Edgy since the Beta version I tried ^^
[02:17] <TGPO> edgy works fine
[02:17] <iKs> katten : Set the group to yourself (katten I suppose)
[02:17] <slinky_> I want to install the newest version of Rhythmbox Music Player 0.9.6, my current version is 0.9.3.1 but Synaptic will not allow me to do a "Force Version", what Repository entry do I need to add to obtain the newest version?
[02:18] <iKs> katten : or set the owner to yourself
[02:18] <katten> iks: how?
[02:18] <jvai> but edgy will change it's socks too much... it not always the same beast week to week
[02:18] <katten> iks: i'm a real beginner to linux
[02:18] <iKs> slinky_: Backports
[02:18] <lullabud> katten:  chown CHanges OWNer
[02:18] <iKs> katten: do you want the grafic version or the console version ?
[02:18] <khafra> If my mouse suddenly stops working, how do I make it un-stop working?
[02:18] <Pelo> slinky_,  if synaptic does not have the latest verion that means that the package is not available yet, you 'll need to install from source
[02:18] <lullabud> katten:  chgrp CHanges GRoup
[02:18] <khafra> Is there a way to reset the mouse driver or something?
[02:18] <lullabud> katten:  each file has an owner:group property.
[02:19] <slinky_> iKs: i though backports was for older versions, not for newer versions, please explain
[02:19] <lullabud> katten:  you can set up permissions based on owner, group, or everybody else.
[02:19] <lullabud> katten:  chmod is used to change those permissions.
[02:19] <Arokh> I have a really dumb question. If dapper is "long term support", why would I install edgy?
[02:19] <iKs> slinky_: Backports or for the newest version available, not implemented on your Ubuntu's version because of stability
[02:19] <livingdaylight> iKs: how do i get system to detect my sound card?
[02:19] <lullabud> katten:  you should probably read up on all of those until you're familiar with how they work.  incorrect permissions is often a huge source of frustration in an otherwise simple problem.
[02:19] <katten> lullabud: i want to setup so that i can access with my normal user in the folder it anying having to use the terminal
[02:19] <slinky_> Pelo can't I add a deb entry to the Repository?
[02:19] <Pelo> Arokh,  no one is twising your arm
[02:19] <kitche> Arokh: if you want updated software but there is alot of backports most likely
[02:20] <TGPO> Arokh because that long term support is for security updates only
[02:20] <sinisterguy> does easy ubuntu work with edgy?
[02:20] <Pelo> slinky_,  not that I know of
[02:20] <katten> Forbidden
[02:20] <katten> You don't have permission to access /test.php on this server.
[02:20] <katten> Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
[02:20] <lullabud> katten:  you can access everything with your normal user using sudo.
[02:20] <Pelo> slinky_,   this might prove usefull   http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[02:20] <lullabud> katten:  your best bet though is to use the ~/www/ folder to put your web share int.
[02:20] <lullabud> katten:  each user on a *nix system gets his own web folder.  http://server/~user
[02:20] <Arokh> well I'm usually all for the most recent version, but the way they explain it, it sounds like one would be better off sticking to dapper?
[02:20] <slinky_> thanks Pelo
[02:20] <lullabud> katten:  so your users web folder would be http://localhost/~katten
[02:20] <katten> how on earth do i set that upp?
[02:20] <lullabud> katten:  ...assuming your linux user is "katten"
[02:21] <lullabud> katten:  it should already be set up if you installed apache.
[02:21] <iKs> slinky_: what Pelo said is true, but you can also have quite new version with the backports ;)
[02:21] <kitche> lullabud that's only if the user option is enabled in httpd.conf
[02:21] <sethk> Arokh, I always advise against upgrading until a release has been out for several weeks.  I have more agreement about this on edgy than I did with dapper
[02:21] <Arokh> sorry, what's backports mean?
[02:21] <lullabud> katten:  this is all standard unix knowledge, not specific to ubuntu.
[02:21] <sethk> Arokh, using an older version
[02:21] <slinky_> iKs: so just turn on backports?
[02:21] <lullabud> kitche:  it is by default.
[02:21] <sethk> Arokh, so using a package that specifies an older version of something
[02:21] <crimsun> livingdaylight: 'alsamixergui'?
[02:21] <crimsun> livingdaylight: it installs fine here
[02:22] <katten> lullabud: dosen't seam to work :S
[02:22] <wildchild> what do I have to do in firefox that when I would click on an m3u link amarok will open
[02:22] <wildchild> now kaffeine opens..
[02:22] <iKs> katten: set you Apache user to www; put your files into the /home/www directory; set the DocumentRoot directory in Apache to /home/www; put www as the owner of the directory /home/www
[02:22] <livingdaylight> crimsun: you spelt it alsomixer-gui first time
[02:22] <iKs> slinky_: exactly, at least try it ;)
[02:22] <Megaqwerty> Where are the desktop wallpapers (the images) located?
[02:22] <khafra> So, my mouse cursor stopped moving around when I move the mouse.  What do I do?
[02:22] <slinky_> thank you iKs
[02:22] <cornell> I've just installed ubuntu server on a used drive, boot failed "DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK..."  Reinstalled and got the same result.  Time to dump the drive?
[02:22] <sethk> wildchild, in the gnome configuration you'll find a section where you specify what program to use for each MIME type
[02:23] <Arokh> so edgy is really new? I don't have ubuntu on the main computer but I've been wanting to set up a dual boot for a while to investigate linux alternative to the windows programs i use
[02:23] <katten> lullabud: very funny :P
[02:23] <sethk> cornell, possibly not
[02:23] <lullabud> katten:  screen -x is a fantastic tool!
[02:23] <TGPO> cornell, looks like
[02:23] <sethk> cornell, that means the boot manager didn't install correctly
[02:23] <sethk> cornell, the rest of the drive is most likely fine
[02:23] <cornell> sethk, what can I do?
[02:23] <katten> lullabud: oww i thougt it was some kind of joke?
[02:23] <bruenig> Arokh, edgy came out october 26 so pretty new
[02:23] <sethk> cornell, you can do a scan with badblocks if you want to double check.
[02:23] <wildchild> sethk: where is gnome configuration :S
[02:23] <lullabud> katten:  anyhow, i haven't eaten in like 18 hours.  i'll leave you in the hands of these fine 893 other people.
[02:23] <sethk> cornell, you can boot the live cd, and reinstall grub
[02:23] <dylan__> What is the boot cheat code for safe graphics mode?
[02:24] <katten> lullabud: are you mad ?
[02:24] <TGPO> congrats oht
[02:24] <cornell> sethk, server livecd?
[02:24] <bruenig> dylan__, cheat code?
[02:24] <bruenig> katten, lullabud is no more
[02:24] <dylan__> bruenig, yeah, like command.  im using gnewsense but i dont know how to get into safe graphics
[02:24] <sethk> cornell, if you are using edgy (or dapper for that matter) the disk you booted to do the desktop install is the "live cd"
[02:24] <iKs> Arokh: and the next version is being released in may 2007 ^^ so Edgy is really new ;)
[02:24] <sethk> cornell, the term "live cd" means it boots up and runs linux without needing anything installed on the hard drive
[02:24] <jneves> iKs: May or April?
[02:24] <charle97> arokh, so you can say you have edgy
[02:24] <kitche> Pelo: what app do you need in windows?
[02:24] <Arokh> well I'll download edgy tonight and think about it while I go drink beer and watch movies ;)
[02:24] <bruenig> dylan__, I was just amused by calling it a cheat code
[02:24] <Megaqwerty> does anyone know where the Ubuntu Wallpapers are located?
[02:24] <cornell> k
[02:24] <iKs> jneves: April sorry...
[02:24] <dylan__> bruenig, do you know it?
[02:24] <sethk> cornell, in this case, you are booting up linux from the cd because you can't boot the hard drive yet.
[02:24] <bruenig> dylan__, no
[02:25] <Arokh> thanks all, ttyl
[02:25] <slinky_> iks: I though i could add an entry something like "deb http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/rhythmbox/0.9/ /" to the Repository?
[02:25] <livingdaylight> crimsun: ok, i got alsamixergui installed now. Not as pretty as Volume Control but its a start
[02:25] <iKs> Feisty Fawn 7.04
[02:25] <Pelo> kitche,   autocad,  If I still had my copy of R14 I could run it on wine but 2006 won'T do
[02:25] <iKs> slinky_: You can, if it's a valid apt repos...
=== jhondoe is now known as andream
[02:25] <specialbuddy> is there a good wiki for setting up wine?
[02:26] <bruenig> MegaQuark_, /usr/share/something probably, for xubuntu it is /usr/share/xfce4, so maybe /usr/share/gnome?
[02:26] <iKs> slinky_: but to had the backports you have to add the correct line ine your sources.list ^^
[02:26] <kitche> Megaqwerty it's in /usr/share/ not sure the exact folder but it's in there someplace but if your adding wallpaper you can just make a ~/.gnome2/background or something like that and use that for your wallpapers
[02:26] <slinky_> iKs: i'll give it a try as well as backports, thank you
[02:26] <Pelo> specialbuddy,  www.winehq.org
=== andream is now known as jhondoe
[02:26] <bruenig> Megaqwerty, _, /usr/share/something probably, for xubuntu it is /usr/share/xfce4, so maybe /usr/share/gnome?
[02:26] <livingdaylight> in sound preferences do i have it set to autdetect or my soundcard?
[02:26] <TGPO> dylan__, its on the pretty little splash screen that comes up
[02:26] <iKs> slinky_: You're welcome :)
[02:26] <specialbuddy> thanks Pelo
[02:26] <Megaqwerty> thanks guys
[02:26] <dylan__> TGPO, i am not using official ubuntu
[02:26] <dylan__> TGPO, gnewsense
[02:26] <sethk> dylan__, you are using unofficial ubuntu?
[02:26] <dylan__> sethk, yes
[02:26] <Pelo> BAN HIM
[02:27] <slinky_> iKs: what line would I have to add to sources.list, pretty please
[02:27] <sethk> dylan__, not sure what you mean, exactly.... :)
[02:27] <kitche> dylan__: why don't you ask in gnewsense channel?
[02:27] <charle97> dylan, why?
[02:27] <dylan__> kitche, no one answers
[02:27] <t3chn0b0y> my pretty litle scren was a spash in 85 when i had to register my  my softway with gov
[02:27] <iKs> slinky_: I dont know, I have the French line for it ^^ Search the doc ;)
[02:27] <dylan__> sethk, i need to know how to boot into safe graphics from the boot prompt, without selecting it automatically
[02:27] <crimsun> livingdaylight: autodetect if at all possible
[02:27] <cornell> sethk, scan for badblocks... that would be e2fsck?
[02:27] <sethk> dylan__, the boot command is not likely to be the same with another distro.
[02:27] <sethk> cornell, no, the program is called badblocks
[02:28] <slinky_> iKs: i will, but what DOC? /usr/share/doc?
[02:28] <dylan__> sethk, i just dont know what it is
[02:28] <sethk> cornell, e2fsck checks the consistency of the file system, but doesn't check all blocks of the partition
[02:28] <wildchild> sethk: where is gnome settings
[02:28] <cornell> Oh.... learn something new everyday :-)
[02:28] <sethk> wildchild, I run kde, so I don't know the menus for gnome, but it should be obvious.
[02:28] <sethk> someone tell wildchild where the gnome settings are in the menus?
[02:28] <TIMo0-> wildchild: it should be on the start menu/ log on
[02:28] <wildchild> sethk: I have KDE
[02:28] <wildchild> but I have KDE
[02:28] <sethk> wildchild, in that case, it's control center from the K menu
[02:29] <wildchild> edgy
[02:29] <wweasel> Question: I've heard that in Edgy they turned off the whole auto fsck after x mounts.  I upgraded from Dapper, and they've always pissed me off. Should I disable it? Where in fstab do I?
[02:29] <iKs> slinky_: Here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
[02:29] <sethk> wildchild, it may say "system settings" on the menu instead of control center
[02:29] <slinky_> thank you very muck iKs
[02:29] <livingdaylight> crimsun: they are on autodetect except for the last one. but when i click on test it tests for ever
[02:29] <sethk> wildchild, usually the last thing on the K menu before the separation bar and the "run command" thing
[02:30] <TGPO> wweasel, at the end of the fstab line there are 2 numbers, one of those says to check or not
[02:30] <wildchild> sethk; ok and I am searchging for?
[02:30] <TIMo0-> !gnome
[02:30] <ubotu> gnome is a project that provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for end-users, users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.
[02:30] <iKs> slinky_: you are very welcome, try to search the Wiki for other info about Backports ;)
[02:30] <crimsun> livingdaylight: the "last one" referring to... (sink? source?)?
[02:30] <sethk> wildchild, I'll get you the exact name, hold on...
[02:30] <cornell> Um... sethk, the server install offers installs, and a rescue option, is that what I want for the livecd?
[02:30] <iKs> slinky_: I dont know yet that English version of the Wiki ^^
[02:30] <wildchild> system settings is correct sethk
[02:30] <slinky_> iKs: that is great, thanks for the info
[02:30] <sethk> cornell, that's not what I was thinking of, but it is another alternative.  the server install is on a separate cd and I forgot that you did the server install
[02:31] <sethk> cornell, hold on one moment, let me get the MIME type settings for wildchild; that'll take only a second
[02:31] <cornell> Ok, so use the desktop cd instead of server, thanks sethk

[02:31] <iKs> slinky_: Tell me if you find your version of RhythmBox
[02:31] <livingdaylight> crimsun: sound capture is set for Alsa?
[02:31] <slinky_> iKs: FYI, web site came up translated into english
[02:31] <FrozenPenguin> hello
[02:32] <iKs> slinky_: Yeah I know, the French version is here : http://www.ubuntu-fr.org
[02:32] <sethk> wildchild, I find it on the konqueror menu, actually, although I think the system settings menu can get you there also
[02:32] <slinky_> ok iKs: will do, ttyl
[02:32] <Pelo> oh come on now,  it's only november  penguins shouldn't be frozen yet
[02:32] <sethk> wildchild, anyway, for konq, it's settings, configure konquerur, file associations
[02:32] <iKs> slinky_: I searched the English Wiki just to find the article
[02:32] <HipotermiA> hi gusy!
[02:32] <HipotermiA> hi guys!
[02:32] <sethk> wildchild, I _believe_ it's a KDE level thing and setting it there will make it right for FF, but I may be wrong about that.
[02:32] <FrozenPenguin> am I posting my url on here?
[02:32] <iKs> hi HipotermiA
[02:32] <HipotermiA> alguien habla espaol ?
[02:33] <iKs> HipotermiA: un poco
[02:33] <wildchild> sethk: can't find m3u
[02:33] <slinky_> iKs: I am very appreciative that you did, cause I am just learning
[02:33] <korba-> hipotermia .. dime
[02:33] <Pelo> FrozenPenguin,   well saskatshewant is in your whois
[02:33] <HipotermiA> hay un canal de ubuntu pero en espaol 
[02:33] <iKs> slinky_: I first installed Ubuntu 1 month and a half ago ;)
[02:33] <sethk> !es
[02:33] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[02:33] <iKs> HipotermiA: si
[02:33] <HipotermiA> a gracias!
[02:33] <HipotermiA> mismo server ?
[02:33] <iKs> #ubuntu-es
[02:33] <sethk> HipotermiA, si
[02:33] <iKs> si
[02:33] <FrozenPenguin> that's ok - I got booted from another server for a crime I don't understand
[02:33] <wweasel> Is it a good idea for me to disable the "auto fsck after x mounts" in fstab?  Like, any reason why it was policy in Dapper and is no longer policy in Edgy?
[02:33] <slinky_> iKs: your doing very good, I am in about 2 weeks now
[02:33] <HipotermiA> gracias!
[02:34] <sethk> FrozenPenguin, what, specifically?
[02:34] <FrozenPenguin> posting urls
[02:34] <sethk> wweasel, nothing has changed.  Do you mean that it was set to "never" in dapper?
[02:34] <FrozenPenguin> I've been using this software for . . . oh 10 minutes
[02:34] <sethk> wweasel, it isn't set in fstab, by the way.
[02:34] <slinky_> thank you folks, ttyl
[02:34] <sethk> wweasel, it's written to the file system; you can change it with tune2fs
[02:34] <iKs> slinky_: If you try different things,you read the Wiki and you keep up asking questions you'll end up as good as me ^^ (wich is not a lot :p)
[02:34] <wweasel> sethk: I head that in edgy it no longer does that
[02:34] <Pelo> FrozenPenguin,   posting random url will probably get you banned but related links are ok
[02:34] <crimsun> livingdaylight: right, and it will test until you stop it
[02:35] <slinky_> iKs: lol :)
[02:35] <sethk> wweasel, I don't think that's correct, but, if so, I would set it the same way as dapper.  tune2fs can also print the current value for how often to do the fsck
[02:35] <FrozenPenguin> I did nothing on purpose
[02:35] <wweasel> sethk: 'Aight, thanks
[02:35] <iKs> Well people, I'm going to sleep
[02:35] <iKs> 2:35 AM here in France xD
[02:35] <FrozenPenguin> by the way - ubuntu looks very sharp
[02:36] <FrozenPenguin> I just installed it yesterday
[02:36] <pilibeen> can somebody help me...my laptop went idle and asleep...and i can't seem to wake it up in dapper...
[02:36] <iKs> See you.
[02:36] <Majic> What would be a really good 3D game for Ubuntu? :p
[02:36] <Majic> 3D FPS game.
[02:36] <livingdaylight> crimsun: yes, that's right
[02:36] <FrozenPenguin> I made a brand-new ms-free machine
[02:36] <Pelo> Majic,  look under add/remove  there are several games there
[02:37] <wweasel> pilibeen: That happens sometimes to my laptop, I normally fix it by changing ttys. Hit Ctrl+Alt+1, then Ctrl+Alt+7
[02:37] <paragonc> so my friend added me as a user - but when i ssh in - the su pass doesn't work
[02:37] <TGPO> wweasel, set the last number in fstab to 0 if you dont want fsck to run
[02:37] <Pelo> FrozenPenguin,  good for you
[02:37] <wweasel> pilibeen: see if it does that anything
[02:37] <livingdaylight> crimsun: is that how it should be?
[02:37] <Majic> Thanks.
[02:37] <crimsun> livingdaylight: yes. Does capture work, though?
[02:37] <FrozenPenguin> anyways I shall try to adjust these settings
[02:37] <pilibeen> wweasel: ok ill try that, thanks
[02:37] <TGPO> wweasel, if it has any other number it will get checked
[02:37] <Pelo> FrozenPenguin, http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84 this might be usefull
[02:38] <TGPO> sethk fstab does control if a drive gets checked or not
[02:38] <livingdaylight> crimsun: how would i know. So far i'm not able to use skype; appears that my mic is not working so i'd say its not 'captureing'
[02:38] <paragonc> do i have to be part of a specific group to su into root ?
[02:39] <sethk> TGPO, The setting for checking is written to the file system.  If you can override that with fstab, that's a very very bad idea
[02:39] <crimsun> livingdaylight: are you using the beta of 3.0?
[02:39] <dulouz> hi, i'm trying to set emacs to use a true type font that I have installed (bitstream vera sans mono). shift-left clicking doesn't show the font as an option.  any ideas what i need to do?
[02:39] <Pelo> paradizelost,  not if you are the installer , your password should do
[02:39] <Admiral_Chicago> what is the kdesu equivilant in GNOME
[02:39] <TGPO> sethk fstab is what turns drive checking on or off, its the only thing that does
[02:39] <sethk> TGPO, I just checked, and that's a different thing
[02:39] <sethk> TGPO, no, it isn't.  look at man tune2fs, which will tell you
[02:40] <sethk> TGPO, the setting in fstab checks whether, at mount time, a check is made to see if the file system is dirty
[02:40] <livingdaylight> crimsun: skype version 1.3.053?
=== Aro{Semi-AFK} is now known as Aro
[02:40] <sethk> TGPO, the other value triggers a file system check _even if_ the file system is not dirty
[02:40] <Aro> Holy
[02:40] <Aro> Lots of people here
[02:40] <cornell> sethk, livecd does that run sshd?  and what's the user id?
[02:40] <pilibeen> wweasel: nope....lappy is still asleep
[02:40] <Aro> Got a question about ubuntu though...
[02:40] <livingdaylight> crimsun: 1.3.0.53_API
[02:41] <sethk> cornell, I'm not sure whether it starts up sshd or not; it assumes you are running it from the console.  you want to log into the box from another machine?
[02:41] <sethk> cornell, the user is root, I believe, on the live cd.
[02:41] <FuzzplugJones> having a lot of trouble getting the broadcom airforceone54g to come up... can anyone help me?
[02:41] <Aro> I have WinXP home SP2 on my computer....How can I Install ubuntu without losing it all?
[02:41] <Pelo> Aro,  ask and patiently wait for the answer
[02:41] <TGPO> sethk, you got it backwards I think, if fstab says no then it wont bother at all
[02:41] <TGPO> sethk, then again I have been wrong before
[02:41] <Admiral_Chicago> Aro: partition the HD
[02:42] <sethk> TGPO, I'm looking at the code, and I'm sure I've got it right.
[02:42] <FuzzplugJones> the driver i have doesn't work with fwcutter
[02:42] <sethk> TGPO, although I've been known to make a mistake occasionally myself ... :)
[02:42] <Aro> I had it partitioned last time though, and the CD wouldn't let me use it
[02:42] <Admiral_Chicago> what is the kdesu equivilant in GNOME
[02:42] <crimsun> livingdaylight: looks like the 3.0 beta is only for windows. Try the 2.5 beta that contains ALSA support.
[02:42] <Aro> So it wiped my HD
[02:42] <livingdaylight> crimsun: ?
[02:42] <Aro> Took me forever to get able to run ANYTHING on it
[02:42] <sethk> TGPO, I don't think so, though.  do man tune2fs, see if I'm misinterpreting what it said.
[02:42] <cornell> Sethk, yes, it's much easier to work from this box than the keyboard over in the corner, with the 15" monitor, six feet off the floor ;-)
[02:42] <livingdaylight> crimsun: beta 3.0 ? what were you referring to?
[02:42] <TGPO> sethk either way we both agree that turning it off is a bad idea
[02:42] <Pelo> Admiral_Chicago,  what doesw kdesu do ?
[02:43] <Admiral_Chicago> Pelo: run GUI as root
[02:43] <sethk> cornell, I've never checked for sshd on the live cd boot.
[02:43] <sethk> TGPO, yes, about that, we absolutely agree.
[02:43] <Pelo> Admiral_Chicago,  try gksu
[02:43] <paragonc> if i'm in the admin group - is there any reason why i shouldnt be able to use sudo???
[02:43] <cornell> sethk, I can ping but ssh is connection refused
[02:43] <TGPO> sethk, I did, it still looks like fstab will have to say yes or no since fstab has to fire first to load it
[02:43] <pi1l> can anybody please tell me. how do i read 8-th number in 5th line in a file, remember, that it is parameter #1, and multiply it by 2 in cpp?
[02:43] <crimsun> livingdaylight: forget the 2.5 and 3.0 stuff. Just use the 1.3 beta
[02:44] <Pelo> paragonc,  what are you tring to do ?
[02:44] <crimsun> livingdaylight: is alsa selected in the audio?
[02:44] <Thuggernaut> hey guys i have an x question, how do i run an application in a different bit depth than my desktop?
[02:44] <MarcN> I was running low on space on ~/ and rm .thumbnails -- how do I force f-spot to regenerate them?  Some gnome way?
[02:44] <Admiral_Chicago> Pelo: that wors thank a lot
[02:45] <paragonc> Pelo - just testing out his ssh connection - so im trying to write a file to /home running as my user - so im doing sudo touch //home/test.txt
[02:45] <paragonc> i ented the password and it says sorry try again
[02:45] <sethk> TGPO, I'm looking at the code, and it is doing what I said.  It is checking for a clean file system, and doing an automatic fsck if it is dirty.  the flag in fstab turns that off, it doesn't check for the dirty flag.  The check for the fsck count is in a different program, specifically in this case the ext2/3 specific mount binary, which doesn't even look at the fstab entries.
[02:45] <livingdaylight> crimsun: in the audio ?
[02:45] <Pelo> paragonc,  try  gksu  or su
[02:45] <sethk> TGPO, I'll set up a test with the count set to 2, but I don't think I'm wrong.
[02:45] <crimsun> livingdaylight: audio config/preferences
[02:45] <crimsun> livingdaylight: (I don't use skype)
[02:45] <livingdaylight> crimsun: for sound capture? yes
[02:45] <cornell> sethk: mmm  sudo badblocks /dev/hda1   Didn't ask for a password, no outputs at all, does that mean it's working?
[02:46] <TGPO> sethk kk it will be good to know atleast :)
[02:46] <sethk> cornell, no
[02:46] <cornell> Ouch
[02:46] <DanaG> Do any of you know how to set up an ethernet-to-wifi bridge (AP, not router) in Linux?
[02:46] <sethk> cornell, not necessarily.  is the disk activity line on?
[02:46] <oht> Question: i'm running an x86_64 system, fresh install, and i want to install the nvidia binary gfx drivers, should i use easy ubuntu for this, or just do it through synaptic? (or some other way)
[02:46] <crimsun> livingdaylight: and no apps are accessing /dev/dsp* or /dev/audio* ?
[02:46] <cornell> uh, on solid
[02:46] <livingdaylight> crimsun: no
[02:46] <crimsun> livingdaylight: good. Now pastebin your amixer.
[02:46] <sethk> cornell, then it is working
[02:46] <cornell> k
[02:46] <sethk> cornell, there is a flag, -v I think, that will make it print more info as it's working.
[02:46] <Pelo> !nvidia | oht
[02:46] <ubotu> oht: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:46] <livingdaylight> crimsun: i don't have amixer
[02:47] <paragonc> ive tried su
[02:47] <paragonc> to no avail
[02:47] <crimsun> livingdaylight: yes you do.
[02:47] <oht> thank you Pelo  :)
[02:47] <paragonc> let me try gksu
[02:47] <crimsun> livingdaylight: if you have Ubuntu, you have amixer.
[02:47] <kitche> !root > paragonc
[02:47] <livingdaylight> crimsun: amixergui
[02:47] <crimsun> livingdaylight: no, I want amixer specifically.
[02:47] <livingdaylight> crimsun: where is that, please?
[02:47] <crimsun> livingdaylight: open a terminal and type ``amixer''
[02:47] <DanaG> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gsynaptics/+bug/70525
[02:47] <paragonc> i know - root owns home - so my user paragon shouldnt be able to write to it without root privs
[02:48] <kitche> paragonc: root owns /home but not /home/paragon
[02:48] <livingdaylight> !paste
[02:48] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[02:48] <skelter> so, things aren't appearing on my desktop anymore...a little confused about this
[02:48] <skelter> there is still stuff in ~/Desktop though
[02:48] <sethk> paragonc, it is possible to set the root password, and use su, but generally it's better to use sudo for a gui program because you don't have to deal with allowing root to display on the X screen.
[02:48] <Thuggernaut> ah i had that problem too
[02:48] <skelter> but it doesn't show up. also, going to Places->Home doesn't do anything...no response
[02:48] <Pelo> skelter,   restart nautilus
[02:49] <sethk> paragonc, by default, only the logged in user can display on the X server.

[02:49] <skelter> Pelo: how?
[02:49] <sethk> paragonc, what are you trying to do?  I know you said, but I'm not sure.

[02:49] <Cpudan80> Hello everyone
[02:49] <Pelo> skelter,   system > admin > system monitor : select nautilus and kill it
[02:49] <jneves> cornell: yes
[02:49] <Cpudan80> Any Wake-On-Lan experts here?
[02:49] <FuzzplugJones> does anyone have a broadcom BCM43xx driver that works in ubuntu?
[02:49] <sethk> cornell, yes, badblocks is very slow.  in the other modes (you are in non-destructive mode) it's even slower.  :)
[02:49] <Pelo> skelter,  it will restart automaticaly
[02:50] <cornell> Thanks jneves
[02:50] <sethk> cornell, definitely not built for speed.
[02:50] <skelter> four processes labeled nautilus
[02:50] <skelter> kill all of them?
[02:50] <crimsun> livingdaylight: your capture is muted and zeroed as is your mic boost

[02:50] <Pelo> skelter,  that's the problem,  yes  kill them all

[02:51] <skelter> well, they're dead in any case
[02:51] <skelter> nothing has come back yet
[02:51] <paragonc> but sudo touch //home/test.txt wont take the same password i used to escalate into tony  and then esclate tonys privs with sudo
[02:51] <wildchild> is in kubuntu repos any similar program like virutal DJ or tractor ?

[02:52] <skelter> if nautilus is not running, what is the proper way to start it back up?
[02:52] <djbryy> anyone know how to get back to windows after installing ubuntu?!?!??!
[02:53] <Cpudan80> djbryy: That would depend on how you installed the OS
[02:53] <skelter> did you overwrite windows when installing ubuntu?
[02:53] <Pelo> skelter,  it should start again , otherwise type nautilus in the  terminal
[02:53] <madman91> TGPO, i just copied over my /home from another source... so when i make a new user .. will it over write the /home ?
[02:53] <djbryy> no i didn't
[02:53] <TGPO> djbryy, yes, you put a shotun to your head and pull the trigger ... J/K
[02:53] <Thuggernaut> when you boot press esc while grub is loading and select windows
[02:53] <djbryy> listen people !!!
[02:53] <Cpudan80> djbryy: Where did you put GRUB?
[02:53] <djbryy> i cant !!!
[02:53] <djbryy> thuggernaught
[02:53] <sethk> djbryy, you mean boot windows?
[02:53] <djbryy> Yes
[02:53] <skelter> Pelo: ok, thanks that worked. i just didn't know if i was supposed to initiate it from a control panel or something
[02:53] <Cpudan80> djbryy: Ask ##windows - its less crowded
[02:54] <sethk> djbryy, usually you add it to the grub boot menu.  although normally the install does it
[02:54] <Cpudan80> I can help you there too
[02:54] <djbryy> AHHHHHHH
[02:54] <sethk> djbryy, windows doesn't appear on the boot menu?
[02:54] <djbryy> ONE MINUTE BRB
[02:54] <livingdaylight> crimsun: got this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31115/
[02:54] <TGPO> madman91, if you deleted it and have a copy of it still where is your problem? cp it all back over
[02:54] <Thuggernaut> yo guys, how do i run a certain application in a different bit-depth than my desktop?
[02:54] <djbryy> ok everyone !?!??
[02:54] <djbryy> anyone there?!??
[02:54] <djbryy> I just installed ubuntu linux!

[02:55] <ubotu> djbryy: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:55] <madman91> TGPO, well... its the home from another distro... and now when i logged in it told me that it wouldnt write..
[02:55] <wildchild> hello, I am looking for some strong audio program for DJ's if there is any
[02:55] <Pelo> Thuggernaut,  why do you need to do that ?
[02:55] <madman91> TGPO, brb.. im going to try something
[02:55] <Thuggernaut> i gotta run an app in wine that doesn't like 24 bpp
[02:55] <Cpudan80> djbryy: Ask ##windows - less crowded
[02:55] <andreuu> djbryy,  i _think_ you have to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:55] <Pelo> Thuggernaut,   I realy have no idea,  have you looked in the forum ?
[02:55] <djbryy> hello anyone?
[02:55] <omnid> Why is it the sound mixer for Linux is sooo crappy, yet windows has had one that's worked for many years
[02:55] <Thuggernaut> rgr i've been searching google for days
[02:55] <sethk> djbryy, andreuu is correct
[02:55] <skelter> djbryy: when i installed ubuntu, it wrote the boot table for me
[02:56] <sethk> djbryy, as root, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:56] <Cpudan80> So nobody knows anything about Wake-On-Lan??
[02:56] <crimsun> livingdaylight: otherwise you need: amixer set 'Capture' 80% && amixer set 'Capture' on && amixer set 'Mic Boost (+20dB)' on
[02:56] <djbryy> ok can someoone tell me how to get back to windows XP?!?!
[02:56] <sethk> djbryy, but, if windows was already installed when you installed ubuntu, it should already be there, and it might be useful to find out why it isn't.
[02:56] <livingdaylight> crimsun: getting same error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31116/
[02:56] <sethk> djbryy, I've told you three times, so far.

[02:57] <djbryy> I put the partial on for 75gigs.. .
[02:57] <djbryy> just for ubuntu
[02:57] <sethk> djbryy, you edit /boot/grub/menu.lst.
[02:57] <djbryy> where do i do that?
[02:57] <sethk> djbryy, easiest way is from a command line
[02:57] <Thuggernaut> go into a terminal and do sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:57] <djbryy> ok and how do i form a command line?
[02:57] <djbryy> what do i put on it?
[02:57] <Pelo> djbryy,  open the terminal ,  type  sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:57] <djbryy> ok one min
[02:57] <sethk> djbryy, there is a "terminal" on the menu somewhere.

[02:58] <Pelo> Thuggernaut,   I realy have no idea,  have you looked in the forum ?
[02:58] <sethk> djbryy, can you paste the current file to the paste web site?
[02:58] <andreuu> probably some way to find out what it really is, but im just doing trial and error :)
[02:58] <Thuggernaut> yeah i have been searching
[02:58] <djbryy> yes i can sethk
[02:58] <oht> first step after a fresh install   1) Install Nethack
[02:58] <sethk> djbryy, because odds are that it is already in the file, and, if so, adding it again won't solve your problem.
[02:58] <djbryy> ok
[02:58] <sethk> djbryy, ok, tell us the URL when you are done pasting.
[02:59] <djbryy> pasting what ?

[02:59] <Pelo> djbryy,  you can skip the stuff with # in front of the lines
[02:59] <sethk> cornell, in the default mode, it will not fix anything.  it will print a list of bad sectors
[03:00] <dulouz> Hello, I am trying to get Bitstream Vera Sans Mono working in emacs. It shows up as available in gedit, but doesn't show up with xlsfonts. Any ideas?
[03:00] <sethk> cornell, there are modes where you can tell it to automatically mark the sectors, but usually, you wouldn't run badblocks directly to do that.
[03:00] <hfhf> does anyone here play enemy territory?
[03:00] <livingdaylight> crimsun: /bin/bash
[03:00] <MikeyMike> ok so i keep getting an error with vino server.... whenever someone tries to connect to me it crashes and i get this error in the terminal that i launched it from:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31118/
[03:00] <sethk> cornell, e2fsck has a mode where it will run badblocks for you and integrate the badblocks output with the file system.
[03:00] <sethk> cornell, but, that won't help you
[03:00] <djbryy> Pelo, Can you help me?
[03:00] <sethk> cornell, because your problem is with the boot loader.
[03:00] <MikeyMike> I dont undersatnd whats going on if anyone knows please help

[03:03] <dylan__> i

[03:03] <andreuu> where is the paste website ?
[03:03] <sethk> djbryy, /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:03] <dynamo> djbryy, what's the prob?
[03:03] <Pelo> !pastebin | andreuu
[03:03] <ubotu> andreuu: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[03:03] <livingdaylight>  crimsun so what shall we try again, that might work that didn't coz of fish?
[03:04] <djbryy> sethk, .boot.grub/menu.1st does not work man!
[03:04] <dylan__> TGPO, still trying to boot...
[03:04] <dylan__> i'll know in a minute

[03:04] <djbryy> flash1:ty!!
[03:04] <dylan__> TGPO, the sys locks up, yes
[03:04] <dylan__> but the screen goes blank
[03:05] <TGPO> dylan__, one sec
[03:05] <djbryy> Pelo, it says denied
[03:05] <Thuggernaut> rgr
[03:05] <djbryy> bash: /boot/grub/menu.lst: Permission denied
[03:05] <djbryy> Pelo, Thats what it said to me
[03:05] <dynamo> sudo!!! djbryy
[03:05] <Pelo> djbryy,  sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:06] <livingdaylight> crimsun: that looks better: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31119/
[03:06] <dynamo> djbryy, what's the prob?
[03:06] <sethk> djbryy, you have to edit the file, copy it, and then paste it to the paste web site.  This is pricisely what you would have to do in windows, so I don't know why you are confused.
[03:06] <MikeyMike> ok so i keep getting an error with vino server.... whenever someone tries to connect to me it crashes and i get this error in the terminal that i launched it from:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31118/
[03:06] <djbryy> Pelo, what is sudo?
[03:06] <Pelo> djbryy,  allows you root access to a file
[03:06] <dynamo> sudo vim /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:06] <sethk> djbryy, did you really think you can see the contents of a file by executing the file?
[03:06] <Pelo> djbryy,  you will be asked for your pasword
[03:06] <crimsun> livingdaylight: amixer set 'Capture' 80%,80%
[03:06] <Pelo> afk
[03:07] <djbryy> sethk, ok um I am brand new at this man sorry ok ?
[03:07] <TGPO> dylan__, I found your problem
[03:07] <drunkpikachu> does anyone know how/where I can get (if they even exist) the non 64 version of the fglrx 8.30.3 drivers?
[03:07] <djbryy> Pelo, where will they ask my passworD?
[03:07] <dylan__> TGPO, :)
[03:07] <TGPO> dylan__, its the video driver on the liveCD
[03:07] <dylan__> ok
[03:07] <dylan__> what can i do?
[03:07] <sethk> djbryy, it would be ok if people hadn't told you exactly what command to run four times.  If you want help, you really have to pay attention to the answers you get.
[03:07] <TGPO> dylan__, here is a link that will walk you through it
[03:07] <rogue780> does anyone know how to convert .tivo files to something like xvid, avi, or mpeg2 under linux?
[03:08] <djbryy> sethk, ok i am all ears
[03:08] <rogue780> !mpeg2
[03:08] <andreuu> lol
[03:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mpeg2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:08] <djbryy> sethk, start over.
[03:08] <livingdaylight> crimsun: yep: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31120/ your scripts are flying now :D
[03:08] <TGPO> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=190166
[03:08] <rogue780> !convert
[03:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about convert - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:08] <dylan__> TGPO, thanks, i'll see if this works
[03:08] <livingdaylight> crimsun: sorry about the fish. I'm really surprised
[03:08] <sethk> djbryy, ok, just about eight lines ago, you were given, _again_, the command to edit the file.  If that didn't help you, then telling you again isn't going to help you.  however, one last time:   sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:08] <rogue780> crimsun: do you know of any video conversion utilities?
[03:09] <livingdaylight> crimsun: there was this rave review about the fish console so i thought i'd try it and iked the look of it
[03:09] <crimsun> rogue780: no.
[03:09] <MikeyMike> :(
[03:09] <MikeyMike> this vnc problem is horribly discouraging
[03:09] <MikeyMike> ok so i keep getting an error with vino server.... whenever someone tries to connect to me it crashes and i get this error in the terminal that i launched it from:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31118/
[03:09] <crimsun> livingdaylight: fish is fine. I just cannot believe it mucks up valid sh syntax so badly.
[03:09] <TGPO> MikeyMike, I read that, and it tells you to run it with -sync to get the debug info
[03:09] <andreuu> djbryy,  you have to copy and paste that to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[03:10] <livingdaylight> crimsun: yea, if it does then it isn't so fine is it?
[03:10] <djbryy> sethk, so i write the following in the terminal?:  sudogedit/boot.grub/menu.lst?
[03:10] <MikeyMike> TGPO, hmm where?
[03:10] <crimsun> livingdaylight: is captured audio audible now?
[03:10] <andreuu> highlight the entire file
[03:10] <MikeyMike> OH
[03:10] <andreuu> and copy and paste that to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[03:10] <MikeyMike> i missed that part!
[03:10] <bruenig> djbryy, sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:10] <sethk> djbryy, spaces count.  I didn't say   sudogedit, I said   sudo gedit
[03:10] <MikeyMike> thanks for pointing that out TGPO
[03:10] <djbryy> ok
[03:10] <dylan__> TGPO, can i say something like vga=vesa ?
[03:10] <TGPO> MikeyMike, in the error you posted, it says how to run it to get the debug info, read closer
[03:10] <MikeyMike> right
[03:10] <MikeyMike> i missed it
[03:10] <MikeyMike> sorry
[03:10] <LjL> dylan__: no but you can say vesa=something IIRC
[03:11] <TGPO> dylan__, have you tried safe mode graphics?
[03:11] <dylan__> TGPO, i do not know how to get "safe mode graphics"
[03:11] <dylan__> is there a command?
[03:11] <dylan__> what is the boot:  command
[03:11] <mzuverink> How do I get XChat to open links in firefox and not konqueror, using the xchat systray i set firefox, but it still uses konq?
[03:11] <LjL> dylan__, it's an option in the live CD
[03:11] <TGPO> dylan__, I thought it was one of the boot options ...
[03:11] <djbryy> sethk, here is what came up when i pasted.... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31122/
[03:11] <dylan__> TGPO, im using gnewsense, remember?  its basically dapper.  i just need the boot:  command
[03:12] <sethk> djbryy, ok, let me look
[03:12] <djbryy> sethk, thank you.
[03:12] <Madpilot> dylan__, is there no #gnewsense channel?
[03:12] <oht> if i have a directory, that is set to root permissions, what is the easiest way to change the permissions to normal user read-write?   (i.e should i login to gnome as root and do it, or just use some sudo commands)?
[03:12] <GaiaX11> which is the command for me to know if i am using edgy? uname?
[03:12] <LjL> !gnewsense
[03:12] <ubotu> gNewSense is a GNU/Linux distribution based off Ubuntu with the aim of containing only free software. The Website is http://www.gnewsense.org Support in #gnewsense, NOT #ubuntu
[03:12] <livingdaylight> crimsun: i might need to restart X or even reboot
[03:12] <TGPO> dylan__, gah then either your going to have to switch or get help from those folks
[03:12] <andreuu> i cant mount my cdrom, says use apt-cdrom , but that says e: failed to mount the cdrom
[03:12] <dylan__> Madpilot, it includes noobs who can't help me.
[03:12] <bruenig> what is the new image viewer in edgy called?
[03:12] <dynamo> sudo chown user:user file
[03:12] <sethk> djbryy, that is the line we asked you to type at a command prompt.  The idea is, that starts an editor, which shows you the contents of the file.  Then you copy the contents, and paste it to the web site.
[03:12] <TGPO> dylan__, I dont know anything about using that to set up
[03:12] <crimsun> livingdaylight: not for said audio changes to take effect
[03:12] <oht> and if i were to use the terminal, what would the command be (to change the permissions of the directory and all the files in it to read write)
[03:12] <dynamo> for a dir,
[03:13] <dynamo> sudo chown -r user:user file
[03:13] <djbryy> ok!!!!
[03:13] <dylan__> TGPO, its dapper.  you have no spare machine?
[03:13] <dylan__> its fine.
[03:13] <dylan__> i guess...
[03:13] <livingdaylight> crimsun: skype has a test call thing to check whether voice is being recorded but now i can't even hear the lady introducingn the procedure
[03:13] <Madpilot> oht, stuff owned by root should generally stay owned by root - which directory is it?
[03:13] <oht> dynamo: ty
[03:13] <dynamo> yw
[03:13] <oht> Madpilot: some stuff i copied from an external hard drive
[03:13] <oht> media stuff
[03:13] <GaiaX11> Am I using edgy? Which is the command? uname?
[03:13] <TGPO> dylan__, I'm on my lappy in a hotel room, no spare play boxen handy .. dorry
[03:13] <TGPO> sorry
[03:13] <LjL> GaiaX11: cat /etc/issue
[03:13] <Madpilot> oht, yeah, in that case, what dynamo said
[03:13] <LjL> at least that's one way
[03:13] <dylan__> lol
[03:14] <dylan__> ok
[03:14] <MikeyMike> TGPO, i did it with--sync
[03:14] <andreuu> anyone help mount cdrom ?  i paste some of my /sys/var/log to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31123/
[03:14] <MikeyMike> same thing.. it even tells me to do it with --sync again
[03:14] <banditpanther> Hey.
[03:15] <andreuu> hello
[03:15] <banditpanther> how are you guys?
[03:15] <Thuggernaut> my brain is about to explode
[03:15] <banditpanther> ouch
[03:15] <banditpanther> why?
[03:15] <qubix__> anyone here run Nepenthes or know anything about it????
[03:15] <andreuu> im fine, my cd rom refuses to mount but , in fact there seems to be nothing in mnt
[03:15] <Flats> Real dumb question here.  I just installed the bittorrent-gui for ubuntu.  How do I run it?
[03:16] <aimtrainer> !mplayer
[03:16] <ubotu> mplayer is a media player. Enable multiverse repo and type sudo apt-get install mplayer for more info please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer  To compile it from source see:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer/Compile

[03:16] <Flats> It didnt put anything in my applications
[03:16] <mbb> anyone run a system limited to 600x800 video?
[03:16] <slinky_> Can anyone tell me how to install rhythmbox-0.9.6.tar.gz which i downloaded to the desktop?
[03:16] <sethk> andreuu, /mnt is a directory.  the convention in ubuntu is to use /media
[03:16] <aimtrainer> !beryl
[03:16] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[03:16] <Pelo> andreuu,   you know the cd/dvd read/burner will only mount if they have a cd/dvd in them
[03:16] <banditpanther> people here ask a lot of questions
[03:16] <andreuu> there is one
[03:16] <andreuu> ah media
[03:16] <djbryy> sethk, I did the thing you told me to do it works now what?
[03:16] <Flats> thought thats what this channel as 4
[03:16] <sethk> andreuu, however you can certainly create a directory in /mnt and use it as a mount point, just as you can create a directory anywhere to use as a mount point.
[03:16] <qubix__> anyone here run Nepenthes or know anything about it????
[03:17] <TGPO> banditpanther, thats what the channel is for
[03:17] <sethk> djbryy, I told you to copy the contents of the file, and paste the contents into the paste web site.
[03:17] <andreuu> when i was doing easy linux it said cant mount cdrom, use apt-cdrom
[03:17] <banditpanther> Oh
[03:17] <andreuu> ill have a fiddle with media
[03:17] <banditpanther> sorry, I'm new
[03:17] <Pelo> qubix__, ,  no need to ask every few seconds if someone can help they will try to
[03:17] <djbryy> sethk, there is nothing in this file!
[03:17] <banditpanther> what;s a good channel to go to?
[03:17] <slinky_> Pelo: I manager to download rhythmbox-0.9.6.tar.gz file to my desktop, now how do I install it?
[03:17] <Flats> bandit for what?
[03:18] <sethk> djbryy, that's unlikely.  the file may not exist.
[03:18] <Flats> depends what you want to talk about
[03:18] <Pelo> slinky_,  http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
[03:18] <banditpanther> Oh..
[03:18] <banditpanther> I have no idea =/
[03:18] <sethk> djbryy, saying a file does not exist is completely different than saying a file is empty.
[03:18] <slinky_> Pelo: site won't open :(, I'll try later
[03:18] <LjL> slinky_, problems with the version from the repos?
[03:18] <djbryy> sethk, ok it is empty then
[03:18] <banditpanther> what's the worst channel?
[03:18] <Pelo> slinky_,  you'll probably need to install build-essential from  synaptic first
[03:18] <sethk> djbryy, you can check whether the file exists by doing      su ls /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:18] <sethk> djbryy, no, I very much doubt that it is empty
[03:18] <MikeyMike> my man file is broken for vino-server ../vino/vino-server:314: warning [p 10, 5.2i] : cannot adjust line
[03:18] <sethk> djbryy, it probably doesn't exist.
[03:18] <MikeyMike> it has tons of those kinds of lines
[03:18] <livingdaylight> crimsun: i got no sound at all now :|
[03:18] <slinky_> LjL, not available from repos or back
[03:18] <MikeyMike> can anyone explain why?
[03:18] <Flats> bandit you should try to understand what Internet relay chat is
[03:19] <LjL> !info rhythmbox | slinky_, uh?
[03:19] <ubotu> rhythmbox: music player and organizer for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 0.9.6-0ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 2910 kB, installed size 9420 kB
[03:19] <Flats> there really is no bad or good channels
[03:19] <djbryy> sethk, ok then so what should i do now?
[03:19] <banditpanther> I'm trying
[03:19] <sethk> djbryy, it sounds as if, during the ubuntu install, you either (1) told it not to install the bootloader, or (2) didn't tell it to install the bootloader to the mbr
[03:19] <Pelo> slinky_,    ok I will walk you trought it ,  first make sure you ahve the build essential package install from synaptic
[03:19] <Flats> bandit just depends what you want to talk about
[03:19] <banditpanther> okay
[03:19] <djbryy> sethk, what is the mbr?
[03:19] <banditpanther> thanks flats
[03:19] <niksoron> is there a way to suspend to disk from the command line on edgy. i did echo "disk" > /sys/power/state and the system is hung. no cursor, capslock
[03:19] <bruenig> slinky_, have you enabled the extra repos, because that version is available?
[03:19] <LjL> djbryy: Master Boot Record
[03:19] <sethk> djbryy, so what you should do is boot the live cd, and install grub.  Or boot a windows rescue disk, put the windows boot loader back on the hard drive, and forget about linux for the moment.
[03:19] <davef> anyone know how to get a usb sound card to reconnect after unplugging it and plugging it back in?
[03:19] <Flats> bandit here, It's a help channel for Ubuntu Linux
[03:19] <slinky_> LjL: i turn on back ports also and can't get it, any ideas as to how I can?
[03:20] <sethk> djbryy, google will give you thousands of hits that will tell you what an MBR Is.
[03:20] <LjL> niksoron: perhaps /etc/acpi/suspend.sh
[03:20] <Flats> Real dumb question here.  I just installed the bittorrent-gui for ubuntu.  How do I run it?
[03:20] <dynamo> lol
[03:20] <djbryy> sethk, ok so put the live disc in and do what?
[03:20] <LjL> slinky_: that makes me support you're on dapper...?
[03:20] <bruenig> Flats, double click a torrent file
[03:20] <niksoron> LjL, ok, will try that
[03:20] <dynamo> no don't go back to win
[03:20] <banditpanther> flats: what if I want to talk about baseball?
[03:20] <slinky_> LjL: yes
[03:20] <p0w> Hello, have a quick question: how do i boot without starting xserver?
[03:20] <livingdaylight> crimsun: ?
[03:20] <Pelo> Flats,  look in the menu under internet
[03:20] <Flats> bandit search for a baseball channel
[03:21] <LjL> slinky_, if you really need the newer version, perhaps you could get the Edgy *source* package (not the binary package), it might be easier to get it working
[03:21] <dynamo> just reinstall it and take most standard answers during install ;)
[03:21] <Tmob> anyone know if i can switch modes to enable and disable CRT output on my laptop?
[03:21] <slinky_> do i need to turn on universe and multiverse in LTS normal entries for repos
[03:21] <LjL> slinky_, "sudo apt-get build-dep rhythmbox" should help you, by installing the dependencies that are needed to compile it
[03:21] <Tmob> i would like to extend my desktop when i'm home.. but not do that when i'm not hooked up to the CRT
[03:21] <bruenig> slinky_, you can get the edgy deb from the online package thing
[03:21] <davef> flats: try ktorrent, it's lots more informative.   Anyhow, click on a torrent in your browser and have it run bittorrent or ktorrent on it.
[03:21] <Flats> pelo, didnt put it in my applications.  Lemme try clicking a torrent file
[03:21] <djbryy> sethk, live is to try the ver. of linux ubuntu not to download it.
[03:21] <Tmob> right now i can only clone my desktop onto the CRT by pressing laptops Fn+CRT button
[03:21] <sethk> p0w, you can modify your configuration so that X doesn't start at the run level (run level 1 for unbuntu is the default).
[03:21] <crimsun> livingdaylight: pastebin your amixer
[03:21] <antoni> hey. just installed 6.10 on another computer. however when the box boots up you can barley see the ubuntu logo. ideas?
[03:21] <sethk> djbryy, ok, since you obviously know more about the live cd than I do, I guess I won't be able to help you.
[03:22] <crimsun> livingdaylight: and asoundconf list
[03:22] <dynamo> antoni, i have that prob too with xubuntu
[03:22] <Pelo> Flats,  you might want to check in enable the link in the alacart menu editor
[03:22] <removeX> hey
[03:22] <cello_rasp> hi
[03:22] <bruenig> slinky_, here is the deb for the version you are trying to install http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/r/rhythmbox/rhythmbox_0.9.6-0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[03:22] <removeX> haha
[03:22] <djbryy> sethk, oh yeah right... dont get all oh i know everything ... I know you might but why dont you just help me instead of put me down eh?
[03:22] <removeX> i have a problem
[03:22] <bruenig> slinky_, what I would do is sudo apt-get build-dep rhythmbox, then do sudo dpkg -i rhythmbox_0.9.6-0ubuntu4_i386.deb
[03:23] <sethk> djbryy, well, apparently you believe what I told you to do isn't correct.  So what can I do?
[03:23] <antoni> anybody else have this problem?
[03:23] <TGPO> removeX, all you can do is ask
[03:23] <andreuu> I try,   sudo mount iso9660 /media/cdrom /mnt/cdrom  , and putting -t in , it says 'not a block device'
[03:23] <removeX> i started out wiht Ubuntu, then installed XFCE and got rid of all the gnome i could, then i just tried to lay some KDE on top of my Xubuntu, but it ran out of space halfway through, so is ther e a way to get back to just the server
[03:23] <LjL> djbryy, you've just said nonsense - the Desktop CD (aka the "live" CD) is the main CD, used for installing Ubuntu as well as for "trying it out". then i don't know where "downloading" enters the picture, but sethk is right in that perhaps if you're looking for help you should not assume you already know what to do
[03:23] <slinky_> brueing: thank you, how did you find that indformation please
[03:24] <bruenig> removeX, just reinstall
[03:24] <removeX> oh yeah i forgot to mention, no CD drive.
[03:24] <cello_rasp> when ubuntu was instaled it shoudl feature the kde, xfce and gnome under different metapackages. removing ubuntu-desktop (for example) in aptitude would remove all the programs of ubuntu-desktop. try aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop
[03:24] <crimsun> LjL: I dunno, you can only smack people with bricks so often...
[03:24] <andreuu> also tried right clicking in places/computers and mount, but no joy
[03:24] <djbryy> LjL, omf I am just really confused alright? can you kust help me? I want help I do nnot know everything.
[03:24] <vio> hi
[03:24] <LjL> slinky_: from http://packages.ubuntu.com i'd guess
[03:24] <removeX> ok, in a recovery mode cello_rasp?
[03:24] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell slinky_ about packages
[03:24] <bruenig> slinky_, in the firefox that ubuntu comes with, in the search engine box there is an ubuntu package search engine. I used that to find the .deb, the other stuff I already knew
[03:24] <AsheD> what exactly does RAM being used as cache mean?
[03:25] <livingdaylight> crimsun: output of amixer; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31125/ Where is asoundconf.list listed?
[03:25] <cello_rasp> removex: no, on command line. ctrl+alt+F1
[03:25] <jkimball4> d
[03:25] <crimsun> livingdaylight: ``asoundconf list'' is another command
[03:25] <andreuu> AsheD means it reads stuff from the hard drive and keeps it there for quicker future acces
[03:25] <dynamo> removex, there's a way, google it, search for 'pure gnome' there's a instruction to get a clean xubuntu
[03:25] <AsheD> andreuu:: ah, that makes sense then
[03:25] <removeX> dynamo, followed it, problem runs a bit deeper tho.
[03:26] <cello_rasp> removex:  there is also a guide on the forums on how to install ubuntu entirely over the internet using debian floppies to get started.
[03:26] <crimsun> livingdaylight: you can't hear anything because 'PCM' is muted.
[03:26] <LjL> djbryy, honestly i don't even know what the problem is, i was following other discussions
[03:26] <dynamo> what's the error message?
[03:26] <removeX> no floppies...
[03:26] <andreuu> they have ram hardrives now :)
[03:26] <removeX> lol
[03:26] <djbryy> LjL: ok w/e tyvm
[03:26] <cello_rasp> no floppy, no CDrom?!?!
[03:26] <slinky_> I have looked and looked trying to find out how to determine what entry to add to the repository but can't find info anywhere, sorry
[03:26] <djbryy> sethk, are you still available?
[03:26] <crimsun> livingdaylight: as are Surround, Center, LFE, and Mic
[03:26] <andreuu> i have no cdrom too :))
[03:26] <crimsun> livingdaylight: you also need to mute 'IEC958'
[03:26] <livingdaylight> crimsun: lol, i thought it was like a sources.list in etc/apt or somewhere. It is: Names of available sound cards:
[03:26] <TGPO> removeX, how did you get it on there in the first place?
[03:26] <removeX> all external and busted this is an old p3 laptop and its all i got for the momemnt
[03:27] <livingdaylight> crimsun: Names of available sound cards:
[03:27] <livingdaylight> SI7012
[03:27] <cello_rasp> removeX: like I said you can clean up things by using aptitude
[03:27] <djbryy> sethk, are you still there? you seem to know most about my problem.
[03:27] <removeX> cello_rasp by using  aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop?
[03:27] <cello_rasp> yep
[03:28] <removeX> thank you
[03:28] <slinky_> bruenig: do you search for deb rhythmbox or what?
[03:28] <bruenig> slinky_, just rhythmbox
[03:28] <removeX> then use aptitude to reinstall whatever such as Xubuntu or ubuntu or Kubuntu
[03:28] <livingdaylight> crimsun: is there a command for doing those things or do i do that from a gui?
[03:28] <antoni> anybody know why i have a very dark screen @ ubuntu 6.10 bootup? i can barley see the logo & can't see any text underneath the logo.
[03:28] <slinky_> ok thank yoou
[03:28] <removeX> ?
[03:28] <cello_rasp> yeah, aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[03:28] <cello_rasp> or whatever
[03:28] <removeX> thanks cello_rasp
[03:29] <LjL> crimsun, do you have a clue what mixer controls labelled "VIA DXS" would be? i've got four of them, and they clearly control the volume somehow, but i'm not entirely sure precisely how
[03:29] <djbryy> can anyone help me by any chance??
[03:29] <djbryy> no one wants to.
[03:29] <djbryy> ok.
[03:29] <slinky_> i was on web site for rhythmbox and found the tar file but don't understand how to find the value to put in repository entry
[03:29] <crimsun> LjL: on via chipsets, they control which registers receive control over the pcm signal
[03:29] <dynamo> well djbryy i asked u what the prob is
[03:29] <bruenig> antoni, the new usplash doesn't have any text underneath the logo. It is just that bar filling up
[03:29] <dynamo> lots of times
[03:29] <djbryy> dynamo, oh sorry.
[03:29] <cornell> sethk: badblocks finished, no output
[03:29] <LjL> djbryy, could you restate your problem perhaps? i guess i don't even have the original questions in my history
[03:29] <ubuntu_> im trying to install edgy on a HD with dapper already. when the install ask me about partitions, i only can format, delete and properties
[03:30] <ubuntu_> so, i cant resize. how can i do it?
[03:30] <cello_rasp> removeX: if you run aptitude on its own it will take you to a graphical list of all the software installed, which you can easily remove. it is handy.
[03:30] <crimsun> LjL: they're initialised to 80% in the alsa-utils initscript so that people whose hardware supports dxs have audible sound by default
[03:30] <dynamo> so djbryy what's up
[03:30] <djbryy> LjL, I am trying to get back to my other operating sys. windows XP and I dont know how any suggestions??
[03:30] <bruenig> antoni, should look like this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=usplash.png
[03:30] <LjL> djbryy, can you reach Grub?
[03:30] <djbryy> dynamo, plz read what i have written to LjL
[03:30] <crimsun> LjL: dxs itself is a set of registers that, on newer via chipsets, allow pcm multiplexing (similar to emu10k1 and cs46xx chipsets)
[03:30] <dynamo> ok
[03:30] <jadacyrus-laptop> Is there a list of all the models supported by the nvidia driver?
[03:30] <djbryy> LjL, what is grub?
[03:30] <crimsun> LjL: unfortunately via's implementation sucks.
[03:30] <bruenig> !grub
[03:30] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[03:31] <andreuu> the nvidia drivers support everything from tnt onwards
[03:31] <LjL> crimsun, i.e. multiple PCM streams going to the soundcard concurrently and being mixed in hardware?
[03:31] <Pelo> g'night folks
[03:31] <jadacyrus-laptop> thx
[03:31] <ubuntu_> im trying to install edgy on a HD with dapper already. when the install ask me about partitions, i only can format, delete and properties. so i cant resize, how can i do it?
[03:31] <dynamo> djbryy, why u want back to the evil windows?
[03:31] <cornell> sethk, how do I "install" a bootloader, mbr, whatever?
[03:31] <livingdaylight> crimsun: so, am i attempting to resolve theissues you mentioned from alsamixer?
[03:31] <LjL> djbryy, it's the boot loader. do you have a menu when the system starts?
[03:31] <antoni> bruenig: oh. but i can barley see the logo and the bar. its looks pretty dark, ideas?
[03:31] <crimsun> LjL: "mix" is used a bit loose & fast. multiplexed, yes.
[03:31] <crimsun> livingdaylight: you may if you wish
[03:31] <dynamo> just mount the partition for the files you could need
[03:32] <livingdaylight> crimsun: sorry, but i was waiting for further instructions
[03:32] <Cpudan80> Ok - let me ask this again
[03:32] <bruenig> antoni, I don't have any ideas. I would however mention that I wouldn't worry about it too much, but that is just imho
[03:32] <Cpudan80> Anybody know about Wake-On-Lan?
[03:32] <Cpudan80> How to get it to work specifically
[03:32] <livingdaylight> crimsun: wondered whether you might give me another script/command
[03:32] <dynamo> you could add an entry in your /boot/grub/menu.lst to get into win
[03:32] <djbryy> LjL, yes i do if i press f2 but that takes me to BIOS but if i press "ESC" at a certain point it takes me into a bunch of ubuntu options...
[03:32] <MakubeX> hello all
[03:32] <andreuu> sethk, when I do sudo mount -t iso9660 /media/cdrom /mnt/cdrom1
[03:32] <andreuu> mount: /media/cdrom is not a block device
[03:32] <crimsun> livingdaylight: amixer set 'PCM' on && amixer set 'Surround' on && amixer set 'Center' on && amixer set 'LFE' on && amixer set 'IEC958' off
[03:32] <livingdaylight> crimsun: in alsamixer then, under each section there is a lock
[03:32] <bruenig> !hi | MakubeX
[03:32] <ubotu> MakubeX: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[03:32] <dynamo> copy the lin part, and change the hda number
[03:32] <djbryy> dynamo, yes i do man just t check something...
[03:32] <andreuu> im trying to install quake
[03:32] <andreuu> and tried a audio cd jus then
[03:33] <antoni> thx. if anyone else has ideas why the logo is dark on my monitor plz let me know
[03:33] <LjL> crimsun, guess you're right, though the term "multiplexing" together with "sound" and "linux" somehow gives me the creeps ;-) must be due to each of the various engines/drivers trying to do it by itself...
[03:33] <ubuntu_> im trying to install edgy on a HD with dapper already. when the install ask me about partitions, i only can format, delete and properties. so, i cant resize, how can i do it?
[03:33] <rowdy> join #ubuntu-chicago
[03:33] <LjL> djbryy: yes, i mean the "Esc" one. have you no Windows option there?
[03:33] <dynamo> ubuntu_, i think if you want to resize, you will lose your date
[03:33] <crimsun> LjL: it can be confusing at times.
[03:33] <dynamo> data
[03:33] <djbryy> LjL, No. there is no windows opt there.
[03:33] <LjL> djbryy: does your Ubuntu boot?
[03:33] <djbryy> LjL, yes
[03:34] <livingdaylight> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31129/ should this work now?
[03:34] <dynamo> djbryy, you might have overwritten your win partition?
[03:34] <ubuntu_> dynamo: what if i install without resize? i will lose data on dapper? what if i use the same name for home ?
[03:34] <LjL> djbryy: do you know which drive, and partition, your Windows installation resides in?
[03:34] <andreuu> i was just thinking that,
[03:34] <crimsun> livingdaylight: you have to attempt it
[03:34] <djbryy> LjL, no clue. even what you are talking about.
[03:34] <livingdaylight> crimsun: music works again :)
[03:34] <dynamo> is your /home on a separate partition?
[03:34] <ricardo> hi! I am trying to install ogre3d in Ubuntu. In Sympatic Manager I found libogre5c2a, can anyone tell me if that will install the ogre3D libraries? THANKS
[03:34] <bruenig> andreuu, check your /etc/fstab to see what it calls your cdrom, it is not /media/cdrom, that is a mount point
[03:34] <djbryy> dynamo, I am starting to think that myself!
[03:34] <ubuntu_> dynamo: i only have 1 partition.
[03:35] <andreuu> omg bruenig thanks, i am stupid and will die !
[03:35] <djbryy> dynamo, what that last msg for me?
[03:35] <LjL> djbryy: ok, boot ubuntu please, and type "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda", and put the output into the pastebin
[03:35] <djbryy> ok
[03:36] <dynamo> i don't think you can resize that partition without losing data...
[03:36] <LjL> djbryy: take care to type that command correctly as written, it can be dangerous otherwise
[03:36] <dynamo> normally you have two, a / and a swap
[03:36] <atarinox> what's the best way to update xubuntu?
[03:36] <djbryy> do i use quotations?
[03:36] <djbryy> no right?
[03:36] <atarinox> through dist-upgrade?
[03:36] <djbryy> LjL, I dont use qoutations do i?
[03:36] <livingdaylight> crimsun: you are a very very wicked man. Thanks a bundle - to me that is like magic
[03:36] <Tmob> anyone here use a laptop with CRT attached to it?
[03:36] <andreuu> bruenig, sudo mount -t iso9660 /etc/fstab/hdd /mnt/cdrom1 ?
[03:36] <LjL> djbryy: no, no quotes
[03:37] <dynamo> atarinox, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade :-)
[03:37] <bruenig> andreuu, it is probably /dev/hdd not /etc/fstab/hdd
[03:37] <LjL> crimsun, how's that hardware multiplexing handled by ALSA (if at all)? and is there a reason why the levels are set to 80% rather than 100% by default?
[03:37] <djbryy> LjL, I dont know if it worked man.
[03:37] <andreuu> /dev/hdd        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
[03:38] <kingace> are there any viable replacements to fireworks on ubuntu? other than gimp and inkscape?
[03:38] <andreuu> but sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom1
[03:38] <LjL> djbryy: if the output is just one line (i.e. an error), paste it here directly
[03:38] <andreuu> special device does not exist :(
[03:38] <azureal> no audio w/ flash9beta on ff2 -- is this normal?
[03:38] <djbryy> LjL
[03:38] <livingdaylight> crimsun: sorry, that was my way of saying thank you :D
[03:38] <djbryy> LjL, nothing comes up
[03:38] <bruenig> andreuu, does that mount point exist?
[03:38] <andreuu> yep
[03:38] <bruenig> azureal, it is not normal I wouldn't think. I have sound
[03:38] <andreuu> tried /media/cdrom1 and media/cdrom as well
[03:38] <dynamo> djbryy, no was for Ubugtu
[03:38] <niksoron> there is no /etc/acpi/suspend.sh but there is a acpi/suspend.d with many scripts in there
[03:39] <dynamo> ubuntu_,
[03:39] <dynamo> i mean
[03:39] <dynamo> whatever :)
[03:39] <LjL> djbryy: ok, type this and tell me what the output is:   df | grep / | head -1
[03:39] <andreuu> pasted var/sys/log thingy here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31123/ if that helps at all ?
[03:39] <niksoron> in edgy, is there a way to suspend to disk from the command line
[03:39] <bruenig> andreuu, well that is the device, I don't know why it isn't mounting, is there anything in it. Generally it automounts. If it didn't automount, it likely doesn't recognize whatever you put in it so it won't mount manually
[03:39] <Boelcke> azureal, I've got flash9beta on ff1.5, and the audio has never been more synchronized...
[03:39] <dynamo> but you can do it too, won't hurt
[03:39] <andreuu> its a q3 arena cd but *sob*
[03:39] <andreuu> light doesnt even go on
[03:40] <azureal> Boelcke, could you tell me what you have in your firefox/plugins?
[03:40] <bruenig> andreuu, those other mountpoints you tried aren't specified in the file either. Not that this would work but the mount point ought to be, according to the fstab, /media/cdrom0
[03:40] <djbryy> LjL, this is the output...      bash: /: is a directory
[03:40] <crimsun> LjL: hardware multiplexing is not alsa's concern. We (each driver) tells the hardware to handle it, and if it can't we propagate the error back up to alsa-lib.
[03:41] <djbryy> LjL, is that good or bad?
[03:41] <andreuu> bruenig, same thing about special device not existing
[03:41] <LjL> djbryy, it's strange. just type "df" and pastebin the output
[03:41] <crimsun> LjL: obviously users don't like staring at errors, so we use a catch-all, alsa-lib's software mixing (dmix+dsnoop), by default
[03:41] <livingdaylight> crimsun: just wondering now how to use alsamixer to mute and un-mute stuff?
[03:41] <bruenig> andreuu, yeah I figured. I don't get it. Hardware failure?
[03:41] <niksoron> hi, anyone know if a way in edgy to suspend to disk from the command line
[03:41] <andreuu> fine in windows
[03:41] <crimsun> livingdaylight: the gui or the console app?
[03:41] <andreuu> seems to see it in syslog
[03:42] <bruenig> andreuu, well I got nothing then
[03:42] <livingdaylight> crimsun: the gui
[03:42] <andreuu> its a ricoh one...
[03:42] <crimsun> LjL: it's set to 80% because 100% distorts horribly. Some users are complaining that 80% is too loud and want it set to 50% by default. Some people can't hear anything unless it's 80% or higher. As you can see, we can't please everyone.
[03:42] <LjL> crimsun, well, i guess that even when there *is* hardware multiplexing, being limited to at most 4 streams wouldn't be great at any rate, so using software still makes sense...
[03:42] <niksoron> livingdaylight, thanks. i am looking to do it from command line
[03:42] <Likwidoxigen> I can't access anything in my system->administration menu and I assume it has something to do with my group file that i though i restored it fully however i'm assuming not. Does anyone have a fix or can they pastebin therir group file?
[03:42] <djbryy> LjL, ok you get it my name in it is djbryy
[03:42] <djbryy> LjL, ??
[03:42] <cornell> sudo grub-install /dev/hda yields "Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device"
[03:43] <LjL> djbryy, could you just give me the URL please? i cannot find it by name
[03:43] <djbryy> ok
[03:43] <andreuu> i mean i could just copy the files from my windows partition, but a cd/dvd copuld be handy im thinking
[03:43] <cornell> Shouldn't mke2fs (or whatever it is) do this?
[03:43] <crimsun> livingdaylight: click the speaker icons above each column
[03:43] <djbryy> LjL, here it is as followed- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31132/
[03:43] <niksoron> how to find out what does the suspend icon call. does it call a script?
[03:43] <LjL> crimsun: distorsion at 100% does sound like something's broken in the hardware :-\
[03:44] <crimsun> LjL: integrated sound is very nearly always crap
[03:44] <crimsun> crap dsps, crap codecs.
[03:44] <LjL> djbryy: ok, type (carefully)  "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda"

[03:44] <thomaslai> hi I am using Nautilus 2.16 in Ubuntu 6.10. Is there a way to revert back the menu navigation view back to the version 2.14?

[03:44] <livingdaylight> crimsun: and then there are the white dots under the speaker icons and the grey and red ones?
[03:44] <cornell> Well guys.... gotta go, thanks all, TTFN
[03:45] <andreuu> cya i boot too
[03:45] <LjL> bruenig, wasn't his fault - i asked him to use /dev/hda earlier instead of /dev/sda
[03:45] <djbryy> LjL, are there 2 spaces between eachword?

[03:46] <MrKeuner> hi, when I try to run avahi-discover I get this error: Introspect error: The name org.freedesktop.Avahi was not provided by any .service files and then a traceback follows. What may be the problem?
[03:46] <djbryy> LjL: nothing happend
[03:47] <djbryy> LjL: went back to my user name
[03:47] <livingdaylight> crimsun: what about the locks at the bottom?
[03:47] <SeAofSaRo> hey guys, i was walking a friend through beryl setup on his system that has an ATI card
[03:47] <SeAofSaRo> when he boots now, his screen turns black and it takes him back to the login screen, regardless of what session
[03:48] <SeAofSaRo> he can access terminal though
[03:48] <Apollo> yeah but is there an area in the app drop down list? how do i start it?
[03:48] <LjL> djbryy: uh... that seems weird, try "sudo sfdisk -l /dev/sda"
[03:48] <crimsun> livingdaylight: the red dots signify which channels of which elements are toggled for Capture
[03:49] <Likwidoxigen> I can't access anything in my system->administration menu and I assume it has something to do with my group file that i though i restored it fully however i'm assuming not. Does anyone have a fix or can they pastebin therir group file?
[03:49] <crimsun> livingdaylight: the locks signify whether level adjustment is locked between channels
[03:49] <djbryy> Lj:, ok that was wiered it worked
[03:49] <djbryy> LjL, want me to paste it?!??!
[03:49] <LjL> djbryy: pastebin the output
[03:49] <livingdaylight> crimsun: Finally, can Edgy handle more than one sound application? like if i was playing music and was on skype?
[03:49] <Apollo> i've used dev c++ a little and i would like to try a linux c/c++ enviorment
[03:49] <crimsun> LjL: that's why I use usb audio
[03:49] <crimsun> livingdaylight: need more context.
[03:50] <AdamKili> checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X libraries. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!
[03:50] <AdamKili> What package do i need? searching for libx gets to many results
[03:50] <LjL> crimsun: well, right now i'm hoping to get my hands on a PCI SB Live!, hopefully that's not going to be *too* bad
[03:50] <livingdaylight> crimsun: more context? if i'm using voip can i also play music.?
[03:50] <djbryy> LjL, ok here is the URL, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31134/
[03:51] <crimsun> livingdaylight: on the same card? that's not alsa's prerogative, as I explained above to LjL
[03:51] <LjL> AdamKili: xserver-xorg-dev might do it
[03:51] <jessmon__> gretings!!Is there a way to determine if I have either the "alternate" or desktop" install cd?
[03:51] <djbryy> LjL, did you get that?
[03:51] <livingdaylight> crimsun: in teh past ubuntu wasn't so good at handling several ....ah...just read your reply...so one thing at a time
[03:51] <crimsun> livingdaylight: if your sound hardware can do it, then it does. If it can't, you can only attempt to hack around it. (Your hardware can't.)
[03:51] <djbryy> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31134/
[03:51] <MrKeuner> jessmon__: In the root of the cd there is a file that includes the name of the cd
[03:51] <GenNMX> What's the default resolution for Ubuntu?
[03:51] <LjL> djbryy: yes. do you have another hard drive? that drive doesn't appear to have any Windows partitions on it
[03:52] <crimsun> GenNMX: depends on the output device's supported modes.
[03:52] <cablesm102> I've been using Adobe Flash 9 Beta for a while, but today it started completely crashing Firefox whenever I go to a page that uses Flash. I tried using Flash 7 (stable) but that also crashed. I started the LiveCD, and tried installing Flash on that, but it also had the same problem. This has never happened before. What's going on?
[03:52] <LjL> GenNMX: 1280x1024 if it can, i think
[03:52] <jessmon__> thanks mrkeuner
[03:52] <crimsun> cablesm102: you should only have one Flash version installed.
[03:52] <djbryy> LjL, no i do not I have one HD of 250 g's.
[03:52] <cablesm102> crimsun, I know.
[03:52] <cablesm102> Only one is installed
[03:52] <GenNMX> Ubuntu is defaulting to a resolution not supported by my monitor. I have proper Modelines for 1920x1200, the optimal resolution.
[03:52] <pi1l> hello
[03:52] <MrKeuner> cablesm102: it might be a new firefox extension
[03:52] <GenNMX> Hmm alright, I'll make a Modeline for 1280x1024.
[03:52] <djbryy> LjL, I only have one Hard Drive.
[03:53] <cablesm102> MrKeuner, no changes have been made to Firefox when it started happening
[03:53] <cablesm102> Also, it's crashing in the liveCD also
[03:53] <andreuu> my dvd didnt appear in bios, so I poked the cable seemed fine, next boot it appeared in bios
[03:53] <Likwidoxigen> I can't access anything in my system->administration menu and I assume it has something to do with my group file that i though i restored it fully however i'm assuming not. Does anyone have a fix or can they pastebin therir group file?
[03:53] <andreuu> still cant mount special device
[03:53] <dynamo> cablesm102, type export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 and then firefox
[03:53] <cablesm102> dynamo, what will that do?
[03:53] <andreuu> noticed a "failed to initialize HAL"  when ubuntu booted this time though
[03:53] <AdamKili> LjL: it didn't work
[03:54] <andreuu> uninstalled BUM which is the only thing I changed but no go
[03:54] <dynamo> prevent FF from crashing on flash sites
[03:54] <djbryy> LjL, dude?
[03:54] <LjL> djbryy: well, the Ubuntu partitions only seem to take about 60Gb indeed. but there still are no Windows partitions mentioned... try "sudo cfdisk /dev/sda", and be very careful with what you touch
[03:54] <LjL> djbryy, calm down. i have ten fingers and one brain.
[03:54] <cello_rasp> dynamo: its flash that is crashing, not firefox
[03:54] <niksoron> echo "disk" > /sys/power/state
[03:55] <LjL> djbryy: tell me if cfdisk shows anything that looks like a Windows partition, or an "extended" partition
[03:55] <djbryy> LjL, sorry man. my mother is getting Fache and wants me in bed
[03:55] <niksoron> hangs my system
[03:55] <Likwidoxigen> can someone please pastebin their /etc/group file?
[03:55] <dynamo> oh i thought, flash sites in firefox...
[03:55] <GenNMX> djbryy: Kinky.
[03:55] <cello_rasp> dynamo: you can program flash to crash in many ways
[03:55] <dynamo> :D
[03:55] <LjL> AdamKili: try xlibs-dev then
[03:56] <cello_rasp> if it's every flash site with the latest plugin, then you probably have a problem on the PC :)

[03:59] <djbryy> LjL, yes it wont work here
[03:59] <LjL> djbryy: just tell me if there's anything else mentioned other than "sda1" and "sda2" if you can't get it to copy
[04:00] <livingdaylight> crimsun: d'you run Kubuntu?
[04:00] <djbryy> there is only SD1 & SD2
[04:00] <SeAofSaRo> how can i remove something from session startups via terminal
[04:00] <djbryy> And something else called free space
[04:00] <andreuu> seems most ppls 'cant initialize HAL' problems just mysteriously disappear... ill reboot again
[04:00] <livingdaylight> LjL: you too. lots of people helping in #ubuntu from their Kubuntu desktops
[04:00] <LjL> djbryy, i couldn't swear on it, but i'd say that either your partition table is corrupted, or your Windows partition doesn't exist anymore, or both
[04:01] <djbryy> LjL, thats what most peopel say so what do you suggest?
[04:01] <LjL> livingdaylight, is that bad? clearly, i tend to avoid giving Gnome-specific help
[04:01] <djbryy> LjL, re-install windows?
[04:01] <AdamKili> thanks LjL, it working so far.....
[04:01] <AdamKili> its*
[04:01] <livingdaylight> LjL: lol, of course not... i have kubuntu as my secondary ls :D
[04:02] <livingdaylight> *os
[04:02] <LjL> djbryy: if you had no important data on the previous Windows partition, then yes, reinstalling is what i'd do. if you have important data, well... perhaps try testdisk
[04:02] <MrKeuner> When I try to run avahi-discover I get this error: Introspect error: The name org.freedesktop.Avahi was not provided by any .service files. Then a traceback follows. What may be the problem?
[04:02] <LjL> djbryy: to start with, try this - run "sudo fdisk /dev/sda", and then hit "v" and then Enter, and tell me what it says
[04:02] <djbryy> LjL, what is the thing called "testdisk
[04:02] <LjL> !testdisk
[04:02] <ubotu> testdisk: Partition scanner and disk recovery tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 6.4.1-1 (edgy), package size 459 kB, installed size 1232 kB

[04:04] <LjL> djbryy: hm, and that's all it says?
[04:04] <GenNMX> OK, now I forced the VertRefresh to 60 with the HorizSync the appropriate 75, and my monitor still says the resolution is out of range. Ugh.
[04:04] <daniel43058> I'm a newbie Hello
[04:04] <jrib> !hi | daniel43058
[04:04] <ubotu> daniel43058: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:04] <djbryy> LjL, after i type "v" yes
[04:04] <djbryy> LjL, this is what it says b4 that
[04:05] <LjL> djbryy, type "q" to exit. honestly, i don't know what has happened to your Windows - you could try testdisk as i said, but you're alone there, because i never used it myself
[04:05] <DavidCraft> hey i hooked a separate (good) hard drive to the computer.  The hard drive has two partitions.  Ubuntu is giving me an error "cannot mount volume" but it DOES pick up teh two different partitions
[04:05] <AdamKili> checking for KDE... configure: error: in the prefix, you've chosen, are no KDE headers installed. This will fail. So, check this please and use another prefix!
[04:05] <AdamKili>  just making sure: do i need the package kdebase-dev to solve this?
[04:05] <GenNMX> All resolutions with my monitor support at least 60Hz. I don't know what to try from here.
[04:05] <DavidCraft> why is it doing this and how do i fix it?
[04:05] <djbryy> LjL, The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 30401.
[04:05] <djbryy> There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
[04:05] <djbryy> and could in certain setups cause problems with:
[04:05] <djbryy> 1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
[04:05] <djbryy> 2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
[04:05] <djbryy>    (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
[04:05] <MrKeuner> oo
[04:05] <LjL> djbryy, use the pastebin!
[04:05] <daniel43058> genNMX, just got through resolving that resolution problem on my install of 5.04, after about 3 hours I got it to work
[04:05] <djbryy> LjL, sorry !!!!!!!
[04:06] <GenNMX> daniel43058: What was your resolution? (the answer, that is)
[04:06] <LjL> djbryy, try "sudo gparted /dev/sda" as a last attempt, see if that shows any Windows partitions
[04:06] <niksoron> is the method by which edgy does suspend documented somewhere?
[04:06] <djbryy> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31137/
[04:06] <daniel43058> edited the xorg.conf file, changed my default depth to 16 instead of 24...
[04:07] <daniel43058> sorry that's defaultdepth, all one word
[04:07] <djbryy> LjL, that was not the right command i dont think...
[04:07] <djbryy> LjL, it didn't recognize it.
[04:07] <GenNMX> daniel43058: I'll try it, but it all seems odd. This is a $1500 monitor, it's not some old crappy one.
[04:08] <LjL> djbryy: err well admittedly the syntax was horrible. look, just run it from (if i recall correctly) System / Administration / Disk editor or-something-likethat
[04:08] <daniel43058> you can say that again, I picked up the monitor and the tower at a second hand store...
[04:08] <djbryy> LjL, ok I am in it.
[04:09] <djbryy> LjL, now what?
[04:09] <LjL> djbryy: how many partitions do you see graphed?
[04:09] <sethk> the message about the number of cylinders always happens and means nothing
[04:09] <DavidCraft> hey i hooked a separate (good) hard drive to the computer.  The hard drive has two partitions.  Ubuntu is giving me an error "cannot mount volume" but it DOES pick up teh two different partitions
[04:09] <DavidCraft> why is it doing this and how do i fix it?
[04:09] <LjL> sethk: i know, though in that case it's quite a big number of cylinders (not surprising since most of the HD seems to be "empty")
[04:09] <djbryy> LjL, there is a "SWAP" and a "PARTITION 1"
[04:10] <cablesm102> I have the latest version of Beagle installed, but it's not indexing my thunderbird email. The thunderbird index is about 200 k, but when I search for things I know should be  there, it only finds thunderbird newsfeeds.
[04:10] <LjL> djbryy: which take like 1/4 of the drive, the rest being empty?
[04:10] <sethk> LjL, he said he had a 70 gig partition for linux, so it doesn't really sound bit to me
[04:10] <djbryy> LjL, what?
[04:10] <sethk> s/bit/big
[04:10] <LjL> djbryy: the graph.
[04:10] <djbryy> LjL, what about it?
[04:10] <LjL> djbryy: there is a graph with coloured bars. how many do you see, and what are the colors?
[04:11] <djbryy> LjL, I dont have a graph on mine.
[04:11] <djbryy> LjL I still only have 5.1
[04:11] <djbryy> LjL, a friend gave it to me.
[04:11] <LjL> sethk: well at any rate he said the drive is 250Gb, so there definitely appears to be a lot of "free" space...
[04:12] <Jordan_U> djbryy: sudo apt-get install gparted
[04:12] <GenNMX> daniel43058: Yeah that worked, but it still doesn't make any sense.
[04:12] <djbryy> Jordan_U, what will that do for me??
[04:12] <Jordan_U> djbryy: I think you are using a different application than what LjL is thinking of, I think he wants you to use gparted.
[04:12] <LjL> djbryy: install the GParted partition editing program. guess 5.10 doesn't have it by default
[04:13] <djbryy> LjL, ok where do i find that?
[04:13] <AdamKili> checking for KDE... configure: error: in the prefix, you've chosen, are no KDE headers installed. This will fail. So, check this please and use another prefix!
[04:13] <AdamKili>  just making sure: do i need the package kdebase-dev to solve this?
[04:13] <LjL> Jordan_U: well yes, i believed the disk editor in the System menu was GParted
[04:13] <LjL> djbryy: type what Jordan_U said
[04:13] <djbryy> LjL, I did.
[04:14] <djbryy> LjL, now what?
[04:14] <LjL> AdamKili: i'd make it just kdelibs4-dev for starters
[04:14] <LjL> djbryy: now type "gksudo gparted"
[04:14] <djbryy> y/n?
[04:14] <Jordan_U> djbryy: Now go to System -> administration -> gnome partition editor
[04:14] <LjL> djbryy: ah, wait. Y.

[04:19] <oht> bseleted by the one that is installed, i downloaded the nivida-glx packages (and the dev packages), and when i tried to run nvidia-glx-config enable from the terminal, it says, Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed

[04:20] <GeekZoid> Does anyone know if dapper has the mod_env module for apache2?
[04:20] <djbryy> LjL, lolerskaterz yes i do
[04:20] <Clin1> Geek
[04:20] <cablesm102> oht, for me the config command didn't work, but editing xorg.conf did the trick
[04:20] <Clin1> Im useing the mod

[04:20] <djbryy> LjL, now what would you like me to do?

[04:20] <campbch> has anyone had any experience getting opengl screensavers to show on full screen on an i810? right now, it's limited to the top third or so, and i've got the drivers and everything installed
[04:21] <GeekZoid> OK. Clinl: which package did you install?

[04:22] <derek_> thanks
[04:22] <Clin1> I did it manual
[04:22] <djbryy> LjL, yes why?
[04:22] <GeekZoid> so you compiled from scratch?
[04:22] <GeekZoid> i dont wanna do that :(
[04:22] <Clin1> Try apt-cache search Lampp
[04:22] <LjL> djbryy: because the other partitioning programs seem to imply otherwise - i.e. that your Linux partitions do *not* take up the entire hard drive.
[04:22] <GeekZoid> oh ok thank you let me see
[04:22] <cablesm102> oht, here's a good guide
[04:22] <djbryy> LjL, so I still have windows somewhere?
[04:23] <campbch> aaannyyybooddyyy? i've checked xorg.conf, and i have the correct package installed, and the screensavers are the only things not working correctly
[04:23] <GeekZoid> clinl.. nothing came up except python
[04:23] <DavidCraft> hmm NEW problem
[04:23] <Clin1> They dont have it them
[04:23] <GeekZoid> hmm
[04:23] <Clin1> up google Lampp
[04:23] <oht> cablesm102: eh?
[04:23] <DavidCraft> why is my external drive showing as 'read only'? lol
[04:23] <Clin1> and go to Appachefriends
[04:23] <LjL> djbryy: i doubt it, honestly. anyway, look at the top right, where it says "/dev/sda" - what's the number it mentions?   and what are the numbers mentioned on the two bars?
[04:23] <GeekZoid> oh ok
[04:23] <Jordan_U> campbch: Are you running Edgy?
[04:23] <GeekZoid> for binaries
[04:23] <saleh> how could i know what packages r needed for openGL???

[04:24] <djbryy> LjL, yes
[04:24] <MarcN> campbch: no screensavers at all?
[04:24] <LjL> djbryy: then your hard drive is 50Gb, not 250
[04:24] <LjL> djbryy: and i don't think you have Windows installed.
[04:24] <campbch> im running dapper
[04:24] <djbryy> LjL, for linux it is 50!

[04:53] <honk_> *What* is a good gnome-based C IDE?
[04:53] <[SUDO] Tux> OOPS, you don't seem to have a valid JRE. FrostWire works best with Sun JRE available at http://www.java.com... anything?
[04:53] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: I don't think so, frostwire says it works best with sun's though.
[04:53] <josephoenix> isn't blackdown a bit behind sun's?
[04:54] <[SUDO] Tux> is sun free too?
[04:54] <josephoenix> yep
[04:54] <[SUDO] Tux> okay lol
[04:54] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Free as in beer yes, just not open source.

[04:58] <chloe> i have no clue what im doing, iwant to be able to use yahoo chat, how do ido that?
[04:58] <Tony_Sidaway> Hi, problem with Sis  630/730  (sis driver) on X after upgrading from 5.10 (Breezy Badger) to 6.06 (LTS/Dapper Drake).
=== mikm[laptop]  is now known as GrueJesus
[04:58] <sethk> chloe, install gaim, it supports yahoo
[04:58] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: i dont get it...
[04:59] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: is it worth it to get frostwire?
[04:59] <cablesm102> sethk, Gaim is preinstalled.
=== GrueJesus is now known as mikm[laptop] 
[04:59] <chloe> gaim, now can i use gaim to talk for yahhoo?
[04:59] <sethk> cablesm102, no such thing as preinstalled.  there are a number of different installation options you can use.
[04:59] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: If you really like pirating music I guess it is :)
[04:59] <Tony_Sidaway> Dunno what the problem was, just seemed to decide that the LCD monitor couldn't handle the clocks, or something.
[05:00] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: ha, does it got lotsa music?
[05:00] <deadhobo> Is it possible that an option in xorg.conf could damage a monitor?
[05:00] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: It uses the same network as limewire
[05:00] <cablesm102> chloe, go to the Accounts menu, then go to Add/Edit. This should open automatically if it is the first time using Gaim. Then click Add, then choose Yahoo from the dropdown list. Put in your information, and you should be good to go.
[05:00] <[SUDO] Tux> letsee, what else did i want to know...
[05:00] <oht> deadhobo: yes, if you try to use refresh rates your monitor could handle
[05:00] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: I found a howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[05:00] <oht> *couldn't handle :P
[05:00] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Sniff... for me? :D
[05:01] <saleh> how could i know what packages r needed for "openGL"??? it seems its not already install
[05:01] <khermans> anyone need help?
[05:01] <khermans> lol
[05:01] <deadhobo> oht, Hm, sounds like that could be my problem
[05:01] <cablesm102> khermans, cut it out
[05:01] <Clin1> Yeah me
[05:01] <khermans> cablesm102, hrm ?!?
[05:01] <Jordan_U> saleh: Why do you think it isn't installed?
[05:01] <Ecko2056> does anyone know of an ipod/philips app that will let me upload songs to my player? id really need it to work on a philips gogear,,

[05:01] <oht> deadhobo: yeah, you gotta watch out for that :(    it's good to get the exact specs on the resolutions/refresh rates that your monitor can handle
[05:02] <cablesm102> Firfeox just started crashing on pages with Flash. I was told to run "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" and then start firefox. It works, but only if I start firefox from the same terminal I typed the command into. Is there any way to make this automatic when starting Firefox?
[05:02] <oht> deadhobo: hmm, you might have to somehow connect that system to another monitor and reset your xorg file to something your other monitor could handle
[05:02] <pilibeen> happy 11/11
[05:02] <Jordan_U> cablesm102: Yes, first start alacarte menu editor.

[05:03] <khermans> cablesm102, typo on my end -- just add it to your bashrc file
[05:03] <cablesm102> khermans, thanks
[05:03] <deadhobo> oht: Well, I can switch xorg.conf's driver to nv and it works just fine; I tried hooking up an external monitor the other day anyway and it was blank

[05:03] <jbroome> dougb: you can usually set it in the client

[05:04] <dougb> jbroome, do you know how to using the default bittorrent client you get with ubuntu?
[05:04] <khermans> dougb, you should enable UPnP if you can

[05:08] <Tonren> Arrrrrrrgh!  Every music player for Linux sucks!
[05:08] <saleh> how could i know what packages r needed for "openGL"??? it seems its not already included in my c++ libereries
[05:08] <Clin1> GRRRRRR...... Come on i was told to use the paste bin and it dont work wtf
[05:08] <Jordan_U> saleh: That is a different story, you have opengl, what you need are the development packages, let me look...
[05:08] <khermans> saleh, are you building something from source?
[05:08] <oht> Tonren: i feel your pain
[05:08] <oht> :P
[05:08] <TehKewl1> Tonren, Amarok is an exception
[05:08] <Tonren> TehKewl1: I just threw myself into using amaroK, and I just uninstalled it
[05:08] <TehKewl1> I know people who switched to linux just for Amarok
[05:08] <oht> Amarok is bloated and slow IMO  :/
[05:09] <khermans> Try Banshee -- it is nice too
[05:09] <Clin1> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31145/
[05:09] <TehKewl1> Amarok is pure pwnage
[05:09] <Clin1> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31145/
[05:09] <Tonren> TehKewl1: It's a little slow, but whatever.  What bugs me is the fricking DYnamic PLaylists.  They are SO BLOODY BUGGY.
[05:09] <oht> lol
[05:09] <Tonren> TehKewl1: How is it pure pwnage to have Rammstein start playing in the middle of a Dynamic Playlist called "Chill"?
[05:09] <oht> lol
[05:09] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: where is /etc/jvm?
[05:09] <Tonren> oht: I just opened up XMMS for the first time and I had no idea what the hell to do.
[05:09] <MakubeX> :))
[05:09] <oht> Tonren: hmm...yeah, it's a bit cryptic i guess
[05:09] <Ecko2056> will Amarok let me upload music to my Philips Gogear?
[05:09] <Tonren> For a while I used MPD/GMPC, but I was tired of not having any real playlist support.
[05:09] <TehKewl1> it's just like winamp... unfortunately
[05:09] <saleh> i'm just writing from my lestur notes the simplest exmple but there r many not desleared error
[05:09] <Tonren> TehKewl1: Are you serious?
[05:09] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, follow this -- forget /etc/jvm --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#head-fef9352fb26820bb774df978180c9dd3a60e777b
[05:10] <Tonren> TehKewl1: I LOVE WinAmp!!!
[05:10] <oht> ;)
[05:10] <Clin1> AHHHHHHHHHHH, ok why aam i like on ignore
[05:10] <lonran> i boot the system, but when it tries to check the partitions it takes soooo long. At the end, the gdm appears but after login, it works also veeery slow, any idea?
[05:10] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: i did, still no frostwire
[05:10] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, if you are asking where is /etc/jvm, then i dont even know how to start helping you
[05:10] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, what is the issue?
[05:10] <deadhobo> If I were to put "Option "IgnoreEDID" " 1"" in my xorg.conf, where does it go?
[05:10] <[SUDO] Tux> directory does not exist: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun
[05:10] <saleh> it means all the functions i used, is not decleard
[05:10] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, what version of Ubuntu is this?
[05:11] <Clin1> please dont make me do it
[05:11] <oht> anybody know the main differences between XMMS and Beep Media Player?
[05:11] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: breezy badger i thinks
[05:11] <Tonren> oht: tehKewl1: It doesn't have a media library.  :\
[05:11] <Ecko2056> TehKewl1, will Amarok let me upload music to my Philips Gogear?
[05:11] <Clin1> It will flood this room out
[05:11] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, wtf -- you need something newer dude
[05:11] <oht> Tonren: yeah :P
[05:11] <TehKewl1> most likely, if you can get it to mount
[05:11] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, get edgy
[05:11] <jbroome> Clin1: i see you, i just don't care
[05:11] <TehKewl1> http://www.cohepso.com/Tehkewl1/vidalia_0.0.9-1_i386.deb
[05:11] <Tonren> FAIL.
[05:11] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans how?
[05:11] <Tonren> Man... every single player...
[05:11] <Tonren> Quod Libet was underwhelming, too.
[05:11] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, either upgrade or reinstall
[05:11] <oht> there was a wincrash audio player i absolutely loved, called foobar2000
[05:11] <TehKewl1> someone make that ubuntu friendly and put the dependancies in there
[05:11] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans will it delete everything on my current ubuntu
[05:11] <Tonren> amaroK would've been PERFECT if it didn't insist on playing Rammstein during my Chill Playlist.
[05:11] <Clin1> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKk im goin to bed
[05:11] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans ?
[05:11] <oht> i would love to see a foobar linux port
[05:11] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, not if you upgrade
[05:12] <Jordan_U> Clin1: I was actually about to help you, i guess you don't want to be helped :(
[05:12] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans where do i upgrade?
[05:12] <khermans> oht, run foobar in wine
[05:12] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades?highlight=%28edgy%29
[05:12] <oht> khermans: i'm trying to avoid wine :/
[05:12] <khermans> oht, well is foobar opne source?
[05:12] <oht> khermans: not really, but he's released most of the source (not gpl)
[05:12] <saleh> i'm still waiting friends
[05:12] <khermans> oht, where is it?
[05:13] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: i dont have drapper drake
[05:13] <saleh> nobody can help me???
[05:13] <Tonren> Oh for god's sakes
[05:13] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: says i need that before i can have edgy
[05:13] <Tonren> Does RhythmBox not have support for custom global hotkeys?!
[05:13] <oht> the sdk for foobar has alot of the source (i doubt it woudl be enough to make a port though)
[05:13] <Tonren> This really makes me want to make my own music player that doesn't suck.
[05:13] <oht> Tonren:  :D
[05:13] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, then do a double-upgrade
[05:13] <Tonren> oht: How can there be so many music apps that all suck?!
[05:13] <saleh> how could i know what packages r needed for "openGL"??? it seems its not already included in my c++ libereries
[05:13] <oht> Tonren: i dunno!
[05:14] <khermans> [SUDO] Tux, but i would recommed backing up your data and doing a fresh install

[05:14] <khermans> saleh, are you compiling from source?
[05:14] <Tonren> oht: What amazes me is that through this whole Web 2.0 phenomenon, NO audio players have picked up on the concept of "tags".
[05:14] <saleh> yes
[05:14] <khermans> saleh, what does it say is missing?
[05:15] <saleh> i include <GL\glut.h>

[05:19] <khermans> deadhobo, why?
[05:19] <deadhobo> I cannot understand this
[05:19] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: haha i know
[05:19] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: but i might as well get it lol
[05:19] <protocol1> does anyone know how I can upgrade my firefox's flash to 9?
[05:19] <jbroome> no
[05:19] <deadhobo> khermans: I cannot, for the life of me, get the official nvidia drivers to work
[05:19] <Clin1> Thanks Jordan
[05:19] <Jordan_U> Clin1: It means you have another package manager like synaptic still open.
[05:19] <khermans> deadhobo, on dapper/edgy?
[05:19] <khermans> deadhobo, they are in the repos
[05:19] <saleh> thx khermans, i try that  and come backone
[05:20] <Clin1> I ran that one off of synaptic
[05:20] <deadhobo> khermans: I have tried on both, I am currently using edgy
[05:20] <[SUDO] Tux> khermans: okay im doing it. brb
[05:20] <khermans> deadhobo, what is the issu?
[05:20] <Clin1> OMg i think i got it
[05:20] <deadhobo> khermans: When I switch to the official drivers by editing xorg.conf and restart gdm, all that comes up is a grey-white screen and a high pitched whine from the monitor
[05:20] <protocol1> does anyone know how I can upgrade my firefox's flash to 9?
[05:20] <Clin1> Thanks
[05:21] <cablesm102> protocol1
[05:21] <cablesm102> hold on
[05:21] <deadhobo> khermans: Here is a picture I took the last time I worked on it http://jhsforum.com/upload/files/IMAGE_00116.jpg
[05:21] <cablesm102> hit enter too soon :)
[05:21] <Jordan_U> !flash9 | protocol1
[05:21] <ubotu> protocol1: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[05:21] <saleh> khermas: nothing changed
[05:21] <Clin1> YAYAYAYAYAYAY its downloading     :D
[05:21] <mjmtaiwan> Good evening to you all merry fellows!
[05:21] <Clin1> Go to flashes home page
[05:21] <khermans> deadhobo, what resolution?
[05:21] <cablesm102> I use the latest version of Beagle, which is supposed to support Thunderbird. However, it's only indexing my Thunderbird newsfeeds, not my email. Is there any way to fix this?
[05:21] <deadhobo> khermans: Can't get it to work on any, but the monitor is nativley 1680x1050
[05:21] <dk0r> Anyone want to teach me how to use apt-get? Im new to linux, just installed ubuntu lts.
[05:22] <khermans> deadhobo, you are using the drivers from the repository?
[05:22] <saleh>  with :freeglut3-dev glutg3-dev libglut3-dev nothing happened
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[05:22] <khermans> dk0r, aptitude search foo
[05:22] <khermans> saleh, ?
[05:22] <khermans> saleh, you installed them?
[05:22] <deadhobo> khermans: Yep. I have tried installing through symaptic, apt-get, and even re-compiling the kernel
[05:22] <dk0r> khermans: whats that?
[05:22] <saleh> yes
[05:22] <Jordan_U> !apt | dk0r
[05:22] <khermans> saleh, are you still missing glut.h?
[05:22] <dk0r> oh apt-get
[05:22] <ubotu> dk0r: apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[05:22] <saleh> i did...
[05:22] <mjmtaiwan> I'd like to request help w/ hostname & network interfaces setup in prep for vmware install
[05:22] <dk0r> Jordan_U: thanks
[05:23] <Clin1> Can some one test my speed and connectivity, tell me how fast it loads. go to http://cmweb.zapto.org
[05:23] <oht> anyone have a link to an x64 version of flash9 plugin?
[05:23] <saleh> khermans, but nothing changed...
[05:24] <khermans> saleh, http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=glut.h&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=edgy&arch=i386
[05:24] <Jordan_U> oht: Adobe won't make one :(
[05:24] <jokker_fr> hi
[05:24] <khermans> saleh, freeglut3-dev resolves your problem
[05:24] <oht> Jordan_U: so...am i just screwed? or can i use the i386 version?
[05:24] <jokker_fr> can smobody try my ftp in active mode via firefox please ?
[05:25] <Clin1> il try it
[05:25] <Clin1> if you try mine
[05:25] <Jordan_U> oht: You can use the i386 version but I don't personally know how, sorry.
[05:25] <Clin1> ftp Jokker
[05:25] <jokker_fr> Clin1=>  sure
[05:25] <sysdoc> !xgl

[05:25] <deadhobo> khermans: Do you have any ideas? I'm pretty much stumped.
[05:25] <jokker_fr> ftp://68.228.57.142   user = amory  mdp = amory123
[05:25] <khermans> deadhobo, no
[05:25] <oht> ;)
[05:25] <Clin1> k one sec
[05:26] <deadhobo> khermans: Oh well. Thanks for listen to me whine anyway
[05:26] <Jordan_U> !chroot | oht
[05:26] <ubotu> oht: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot use this to build 32 bit environments on a 64 bit box
[05:26] <xerophyte> say for examle i wanna change permission only for the directory in a directory and subdirectory how can i change them  chmod 755 -R will change the files to how can i only change the directories
[05:26] <Clin1> ok loging in
[05:26] <jokker_fr> you can see the folders ?
[05:26] <khermans> deadhobo, check your modelines
[05:26] <jokker_fr> on firefox ?
[05:26] <mjmtaiwan> yes
[05:26] <Clin1> its being slow
[05:26] <mjmtaiwan> folders there
[05:27] <mjmtaiwan> but slow load
[05:27] <Clin1> Im loaading thats why
[05:27] <mjmtaiwan> on safari too
[05:27] <deadhobo> khermans: I tried using other people's values with a similar laptop, and using a modeline generator (neither worked), but I don't know where to find the exact values. Do you think my manufacturerer could tell me?
[05:27] <Clin1> Mine is still beging translation
[05:27] <lucas9000> how do i find out what version of linux kernel i am running, without restarting?
[05:28] <khermans> deadhobo, no -- just use the default Xorg.conf if you still have it
[05:28] <Clin1> mine wont go through
[05:28] <jokker_fr> lucas9000 => uname -r
[05:28] <jokker_fr> lucas9000 => uname -a
[05:28] <lucas9000> ty jokker
[05:28] <deadhobo> khermans: Err... let me look
[05:29] <mjmtaiwan> can't change my hostname by changing /etc/hosts... any ideas?
[05:30] <Alethes> how about /etc/hostname?
[05:30] <Alethes> :P
[05:30] <mjmtaiwan> Alethes... did that... still showing original hostname even after restart.  strange
[05:31] <deadhobo> khermans: All my origional seems to have is "1680x1050_60"
[05:31] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: What's /etc/hostname read now?
[05:31] <Jordan_U> oht: By the way, when you get the 32bit chroot working you will need to install the 32 bit version of firefox also because, AFIK, you can't run 32 bit plugins in 64 bit firefox.
[05:31] <mjmtaiwan> I'll pastebin it.
[05:31] <deadhobo> khermans: But I am pretty sure that was generated by reconfiguring X.. forget the command tho
[05:31] <agent> xerophyte: use ls recursively with directories only (something like ls -R -d) and pipe that to xargs... so something like ls -R -d | xargs chmod 0777  NOTICE: read man pages for ls and xargs before attempting this! - in  fact, test it first on fake directories
[05:32] <khermans> deadhobo, get rid of it
[05:32] <Dralid> How can you tell if you are running the right nVidia drivers in edgy eft?
[05:32] <oht> Jordan_U: um, i'll just see what my life is like without flash for now ;)
[05:32] <deadhobo> khermans: Just that particular mode, or clear out everything?
[05:32] <mjmtaiwan> pastbin.ca/246406
[05:32] <khermans> deadhobo, that mode
[05:32] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: get that?
[05:32] <khermans> and set size to 800x600
[05:33] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: ya
[05:33] <xerophyte> agent, you mean find
[05:33] <agent> xerophyte: sure, find will work too :)
[05:33] <xerophyte> agent, ls -R -d
[05:33] <xerophyte> does not work
[05:33] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: That's your hosts file, not hostname
[05:34] <agent> xerophyte: i was just guessing... read the man pages (or use find)
[05:34] <babo> how do I find out which version of ubuntu I'm running ?
[05:34] <jbroome> !version
[05:34] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[05:34] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: $hostname mmorrison-desktop (that is what I set it during desktop install)
[05:35] <oht> is there a version of flash that will work on x64 without too much trouble?
[05:35] <jbroome> if a 32 bit chroot is too much trouble, then no
[05:35] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: So you just need to change the /etc/hostname file still
[05:35] <oht> jbroome: booooo ;)
[05:36] <deadhobo> Sorry for my nub-ness, but what is the rename command/
[05:36] <deadhobo> just
[05:36] <deadhobo> *just "rename"?
[05:36] <khermans> deadhobo, renames files
[05:36] <sethk> deadhobo, to rename a single file, use mv
[05:37] <deadhobo> sethk: Thanks :)
[05:37] <clearzen> Can someone help me get a onboard via card working??
[05:37] <Dralid> How can I tell if I can use the 3D acceleration of my video card (for edgy)?
[05:38] <oht> Dralid: try out some GL screensavers and see if they run at decent fps
[05:38] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: I'm following this howtoforge prefect ubuntu setup and it says to modify the /etc/hosts.  Then use hostname to confirm.
[05:38] <oht> an easy way is also to drag the transluscent selection rectangle on the dektop and see if it lags
[05:39] <jtf0518> or run glxgears in terminal. If  you get a really high frames per second count it's most likely doing 3D accel.
[05:39] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: You have to change both files.  hostname specifies the name.  hosts specifies what computers your computer knows about, and it's usually a good idea for it to know itself.
[05:39] <quinnster> Does Ubuntu (6.10) offer a firewall?  Is there anything I should do to protect myself when connecting to the Internet?  Thanks!
[05:39] <jtf0518> temet nosce
[05:39] <tonyyarusso> !firewall | quinnster
[05:39] <ubotu> quinnster: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[05:40] <quinnster> So can I do an /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall like in Slackware?
[05:40] <graeme> I've downloaded the dapper democracyTV packages from the site. But they tell me that I have unmet dependencies ...
[05:40] <graeme> Package mozilla-psm is not installed.
[05:40] <graeme> Package mozilla-dev is not installed.
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> quinnster: Do a what?
[05:41] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: Hmm... they must have missed that step.  So change /etc/hostname and restart. (I already installed the rest of the vmware files already... I don't need to redo the whole thing I guess?)
[05:41] <graeme> I can't find those packages ...
[05:41] <deadhobo> what is the best place for support on a large problem? ubuntu forums?
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> mjmtaiwan: I don't even think you have to restart, but maybe.
[05:41] <graeme> why would the dapper .debs still have unmet dependencies like that ?
[05:41] <tonyyarusso> deadhobo: Usually hit everything available.  Here, forums, and mailing list.
[05:41] <quinnster> tonyyarusso: I new to Ubuntu (using 6.10) but have used Slackware for a long time.  I know how to set up an iptables firewall with a script in /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.  Is that how it done on Ubuntu as well?
[05:42] <graeme> Also, my dapper upgrade came with no xchat ...
[05:42] <deadhobo> tonyyarusso: Ah, I didn't know of the mailing list. Thanks for the tip
[05:42] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: Thanks... restarting... I'll let you know.
[05:42] <tonyyarusso> quinnster: I'm not aware of such a script, but have never tried.
[05:42] <Davo_Dinkum> Is there a way to stop network folders/shares showing on the desktop?
[05:42] <quinnster> OK.  Il do some more looking.  Thanks for your time.
[05:43] <xiambax> is there something like fsck for repairing ntfs disks?
[05:43] <jtf0518> xiambax, it's called chkdsk in Windows
[05:44] <mjmtaiwan> tonyyarusso: Well done... thank you!
[05:44] <graeme> Noone has any ideas on the mozilla-dev and mozilla-psm dependencies then ? Has anyone installed democracy TV ?
[05:44] <xiambax> jtf0518 what about in linux?
[05:44] <Davo_Dinkum> Is there a way to stop network folders/shares showing on the desktop?
[05:45] <jtf0518> i wouldn't try to repair an NTFS volume within Linux
[05:45] <Celeste> hi
[05:45] <Celeste> 2 questions:
[05:45] <effie_jayx> Celeste hi
[05:45] <jtf0518> Davo, try the Gnome configuration editor it's in the repos.
[05:45] <Celeste> 1) is Kubuntu not as stable as Ubuntu?  (I heard something like that)
[05:45] <xiambax> its all the same
[05:46] <effie_jayx> Celeste it is
[05:46] <xiambax> ones gnome, ones kde
[05:46] <lotusleaf> Celeste: that depends, have you ever tried a program called, "KBear"? :P
[05:46] <graeme> How typicallly Linux ... :-(
[05:46] <effie_jayx> graeme:  how so?
[05:46] <Celeste> effie_jayx: I placed a negative question. So I said "is ... not..."  you answered "it is"  ... So do you mean "it is NOT as stable as"  or  "it is as stable as" ?
[05:47] <Davo_Dinkum> jtf0518: where is gnome configuration editor?
[05:47] <Celeste> nope lotusleaf
[05:47] <effie_jayx> is it  as stable
[05:47] <lotusleaf> Celeste: good, good. =)
[05:47] <Celeste> lotusleaf, why
[05:47] <effie_jayx> Celeste:  it is as stable... I tryed it but.. I'm a gnome guy
[05:47] <effie_jayx> :)_
[05:48] <Celeste> ok
[05:48] <graeme> effie_jayx: well the dapper debs have unmet dependencies that aren't in the repos. Installing anything on Linux that's not in the repos is usually a major pain in the ass ... IMO
[05:48] <lotusleaf> Celeste: well, ubuntu and kubuntu are stable for me, but the program KBear would always crash on me and I'd curse the little bear icon, but I use other ftp clients now, thankfully. =) It's all godo
[05:48] <lotusleaf> good*
[05:48] <paragonc> when i install kopete - i can connect to aim - but it doesn't load my buddy list -
[05:48] <Celeste> graeme, talking about Kubuntu or Ubuntu?
[05:48] <jtf0518> Davo, go to Add/Remove programs and look in the System Tools section for Configuration Editor.
[05:48] <effie_jayx> graeme:  well I haven't had the need to isntall things that are not in the repos... but some stuff . like Eclipse SDK is better from outside thant the version in the repos
[05:49] <graeme> Celeste: Ubuntu
[05:49] <Celeste> good one more question:
[05:49] <Davo_Dinkum> jtf0518: Can I do it through apt-get?
[05:50] <jtf0518> I imagine you could but I don't know the package name.
[05:50] <jtf0518> But it's in Synaptic
[05:50] <graeme> I dunno. Sometime I miss windows. You just click and it installs. Linux is the exact opposite. I'm probably going to be chasing dependencies for about an hour ... And they are supposed to be .debs for a dapper system ...
[05:50] <effie_jayx> graeme:  that's the whole point of a distro...
[05:51] <graeme> effie__jayx: what ? to make things needlessly complicated ?
[05:51] <effie_jayx> graeme:  in windows. you have a lot of installers doing things their way .. an fiddleing around with the windows registry
[05:51] <Celeste> there is a LIVE-CD and an "alternate" CD.  I heard the "alternate" one would be better for some purposes.  I will install (K)ubuntu on my Toshiba laptop today.  So I fear that something could not work.  If I use the LIVE-CD I would have a WYSIWYG Preview to see wether or not it will run after installing.
[05:51] <Celeste> But:
[05:51] <Davo_Dinkum> jtf0518: I'll do it with Add/Remove then.
[05:51] <effie_jayx> graeme:  have you ever tried unsitalling NORTO ANTIVIRUS...
[05:51] <TGPO> windows = a computer with training wheels
[05:51] <paragonc> whats a good replacement if i can't get kopete working?
[05:51] <Davo_Dinkum> Gaim?
[05:52] <TGPO> paragonc, gaim
[05:52] <effie_jayx> graeme:  your machine becomes turtle slow after a couple of installs
[05:52] <Celeste> does the LIVE-CD produce a running Ubuntu which is AS stable as the Installation which came by an alternate-installation??
[05:52] <paragonc> needs to be similar to trillian or kopete - i use yahoo - aim - and icq -
[05:52] <tonyyarusso> Celeste: The end result is the same if you're doing a default install.
[05:52] <TGPO> paragonc, gaim
[05:52] <Celeste> tonyyarusso: Thank you!
[05:53] <effie_jayx> CEleste it runs faster though
[05:53] <Jordan_U> graeme: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DemocracyPlayer ( the wiki is your friend ) :)
[05:53] <Celeste> effie_jayx, the installation itself or the finished installed system?
[05:53] <Davo_Dinkum> jtf0518: It's already installed. What now?
[05:53] <effie_jayx> graeme:  i'll gie yo a link
[05:53] <effie_jayx> graeme:  installed system
[05:53] <graeme> effie_jayx: Ok I'll check out the wiki thanks ...
[05:54] <TGPO> Celeste, the install from liveCD is much faster, never noticed one way or the other after install
[05:54] <jtf0518> Davo, in the tree go to /apps/nautilus/desktop and uncheck the volumes visible.
[05:54] <effie_jayx> graeme: there is a reason for the repos.. let me send a link.....
[05:54] <capiCrimm> can anyone tell me how to get a font specifier string for xft fonts? Like the ones xfontsel gives.
[05:54] <mzli> !lanchpad
[05:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lanchpad - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:55] <DanSchnell> Question: Why doesn't the alternate installer partition my harddrive?  I've gotten to the partitioner and tried to get it to work, but It just keeps bringing me back to the main partition memu
[05:55] <Jordan_U> Celeste: The system installed by the liveCD is all but identicle to the one installed by the alternateCD, the alternateCD just gives more other options.
[05:55] <Celeste> ok
[05:55] <Celeste> last question:
[05:56] <effie_jayx> graeme: packaging is key http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/66    <----- Mr Shuttleworth
[05:56] <ixian_> i need some help setting up a fat32 partition. i want to be able to copy/save files to this partition without using sudo on the command line. ive tried about 5 different lines in my fstab and nothing seems to work.
[05:56] <effie_jayx> check the ubuntuguide.org
[05:56] <Celeste> Firefox  and Openoffice,  xchat and gaim ... (and many other programs) start at least 3 seconds faster on Windows XP as on Linux Ubuntu (on the SAME PC!)  -> why?  -> solution?
[05:56] <effie_jayx> you can auto mount it...
[05:57] <effie_jayx> Celeste give your widnows xp 6 more months and test again
[05:57] <TGPO> Celeste, thats a question with a lot of answers
[05:57] <Celeste> TGPO: Can't it just be fixed?
[05:57] <RabidDog> !tell RabidDog about gallery2
[05:57] <Celeste> effie_jayx, its 18 month old
[05:57] <Davo_Dinkum> jtf0518: Thanks.
[05:58] <TGPO> Celeste, sure, complie all your own software and you'll see those apps fly
[05:58] <effie_jayx> Celeste:  sorry just being funny
[05:58] <RabidDog> for bloodysakes why don't they tell us when they change configuration file structure when upgraindg
[05:58] <RabidDog> sum ppl are idiots
[05:58] <Celeste> TGPO: compiling from source?
[05:58] <TGPO> Celeste, right
[05:58] <RabidDog> sighs
[05:58] <RabidDog> Now how the heck do I get my gallery to work now
[05:59] <Jordan_U> Celeste: Try xubuntu, it is lighter weight.
[05:59] <RabidDog> google is hopeless at the moment
[05:59] <jutty> hey i havean 80 gig hard drive with windows and ubuntu on it i wanna resize my wndows partition to give linux more space how should i do that?
[05:59] <TGPO> Celeste, also loosing all the bloat (dont shoot me guys) that KDE/Gnome load in helps too
[05:59] <Celeste> TGPO, but the whole Ubuntu Distro is built by Packages, isn't it?  Then I should use a Sources-Based distro,  isn't it?
[05:59] <tonyyarusso> Celeste: Most likely because on Windows you have various libaries built into each application, meaning they can load faster, but end up duplicating things inefficiently and cluttering up your disk.  Linux has shared libraries, so sourcing them can take some time, but it's more intelligent.  You can speed up that process using the 'prelink' package, and others.
[05:59] <RabidDog> src based distro ='s super headache
[05:59] <TGPO> Celeste, all linux distros can be done from source, but a sourced based distro isnt for someone who has less than a month to get a system up and running
[06:00] <Celeste> RabidDog: is this good?
[06:00] <Davo_Dinkum> Bye.
[06:00] <RabidDog> If u want a headache
[06:00] <Celeste> what is headache?
[06:00] <Celeste> ah, headache!!
[06:00] <RabidDog> lets say migraine?
[06:00] <Celeste> got it
[06:00] <Celeste> sorry
[06:00] <RabidDog> lmao
[06:00] <RabidDog> I've played with all
[06:00] <RabidDog> and settled on ubuntu
[06:01] <effie_jayx> prelink can take a while though
[06:01] <TGPO> Gentoo = Linux for the OCD
[06:01] <Celeste> OCD?
[06:01] <effie_jayx> oCD?
[06:01] <RabidDog> now if I could only figured what the hell they did with gallery so I cna get it working again
[06:01] <TGPO> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
[06:01] <Celeste> I thought about giving slackware or freebsd a try

[06:01] <graeme> guys, why does democracy TV requre mozilla-dev and mozilla-psm ? And where can I find these two packages ?
[06:01] <Celeste> hehe
[06:01] <RabidDog> sighs
[06:01] <graeme> I've tried linking them to libnss3 ... but no luck ...
[06:02] <compudaze> slackware? i haven't used that in 10 years
[06:02] <RabidDog> Anyone know what the heck the ubuntu team did gallery?
[06:02] <RabidDog> with this upgrade
[06:02] <Jordan_U> graeme: The wiki instructions don't work?
[06:02] <graeme> why isn't mozilla-dev in the repos ?
[06:02] <effie_jayx> compudaze:  well people still use it
[06:02] <RabidDog> do uhave universe enabled
[06:02] <effie_jayx> compudaze:  :)
[06:02] <Jordan_U> graeme: Because it is?
[06:02] <Jordan_U> !info mozilla-dev

[06:03] <RabidDog> err I hate devlopers, they never explain themselves
[06:03] <Celeste> Hey guys,  I wanted to thank you all who helped me by answering my questions
[06:03] <RabidDog> must be that OCD
[06:03] <Celeste> So Thank you very much!
[06:03] <TGPO> RabidDog, yup
[06:04] <RabidDog> drives nuts, I have no idea how  to get gallery working now that it upgraded to gallery 2 and moved the gallery dir somewhere
[06:04] <compudaze> jutty: gparted should do it
[06:04] <effie_jayx> graeme: just a question... whay are you chasing dependencies for an hour?
[06:04] <graeme> Celeste: It's not in my repos on dapper ? ... are you on edgy ?
[06:04] <graeme> which repos do you have enabled ?
[06:04] <RabidDog> heres the word gparted and runs screaming in agony
[06:04] <Celeste> graeme, dapper
[06:05] <Jordan_U> !repositories | graeme
[06:05] <ubotu> graeme: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[06:05] <Celeste> graeme, I post my sources.list for you
[06:05] <jtf0518> graeme, do you have multiverse and universe enabled in your repositories? I'm finding both those libs just fine on my box.
[06:05] <graeme> effie_jayx: ??? because I'm trying to install some software ...
[06:05] <Celeste> http://85.237.25.110/sources.list
[06:05] <Celeste> @ graeme
[06:05] <ixian_> what is the command to give all users read/write access to a folder and all subfolders and files
[06:06] <Jordan_U> graeme: It is in universe
[06:06] <jtf0518> both mozilla-dev and mozilla-psm are there
[06:06] <effie_jayx> graeme:  lie?
[06:06] <effie_jayx> graeme:  like waht?
[06:06] <Celeste> ixian_:  chmod -R 777 /path/to/dir/
[06:06] <compudaze> ixian_: chmod -R a+w folder
[06:06] <Celeste> ixian_, but be careful, I warn you
[06:07] <Rookie-> Celeste, 777 is read and write and execute ...
[06:07] <Jordan_U> graeme: Before chasing down dependencies always check the other repositories, almost everything is there.
[06:07] <compudaze> ixian_: actualy, chmod -R a+rw folder
[06:07] <bruenig> graeme, copy and paste the following, sudo sed '/s/# deb/deb/g' -i.old /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mozilla-dev mozilla-psm
[06:07] <ixian_> its for my music folder on a fat32 drive, for some reason it has a little lock symbol on the folder icon and i cant copy files to this partition
[06:07] <TGPO> DONT DO THAT!!!
[06:07] <Celeste> ixian_, Rookie- just corrected me !  chmod -R a+w folder   is the right way to do it - be careful anyway
[06:07] <Celeste> TGPO!
[06:07] <ixian_> so i assume its a problem with the permissions..
[06:07] <Celeste> ;)
[06:08] <jutty> gparted only the gave me the option to format to fter i umounted the ntfs partition
[06:08] <compudaze> jutty: u may need ntfstools installed
[06:08] <compudaze> jutty: and u can't resize it when mounted
[06:09] <TGPO> Celeste I actually did that once prior to a reinstall just to see what would happen :)
[06:09] <jutty> i unmounted
[06:09] <jutty> ingparted
[06:09] <RabidDog> looking for a Gallery expert
[06:09] <Jordan_U> TGPO: I remember, you were on #ubuntu-offtopic at the time :)
[06:09] <Rookie-> become an expert by learning ....
[06:10] <RabidDog> I can't learn if there is nothing to learn from
[06:10] <Celeste> TGPO, please tell me the result!
[06:10] <Celeste> TGPO, i wanted to try it several times
[06:10] <compudaze> jutty: do you have ntfsprogs installed?
[06:10] <RabidDog> No documentation on what they did
[06:10] <graeme> how do I update my sources.list then, after editing it ?
[06:10] <bruenig> graeme, just copy and paste that entire thing,
[06:10] <jutty> doing that right now
[06:10] <Jordan_U> graeme: sudo apt-get update , or click update in synaptic
[06:10] <[SUDO] Tux> YAY i'm getting the new version of ubuntu right now!
[06:10] <compudaze> [SUDO] Tux: YAY!
[06:10] <TGPO> Celeste it does go boom nicely, there are a few things it wont delete, but it wont save your system
[06:10] <RabidDog> Be very scared Tux
[06:11] <[SUDO] Tux> why?
[06:11] <jtf0518> haha
[06:11] <Rookie-> RabidDog, http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Main_Page
[06:11] <RabidDog> rookie doesn't tell what Ubuntu did
[06:11] <jtf0518> Some people are calling Edgy the roach motel of distros.
[06:11] <RabidDog> edgy = expermiental intros
[06:11] <bruenig> edgy = best distro ever
[06:12] <compudaze> edgy isn't a distro
[06:12] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: They named it "Edgy" for a reason ?
[06:12] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: They named it "Edgy" for a reason :)
[06:12] <jtf0518> not judging by the number of problem posts, bruenig
[06:12] <RabidDog> yes they did jordan
[06:12] <bruenig> edgy = best version of the best distro ever
[06:12] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U really?
[06:12] <compudaze> edgy is the codename for ubuntu 6.10
[06:12] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U is it bad?
[06:12] <Rookie-> difficult to discuss taste ....
[06:12] <bruenig> jtf0518, if people don't have problems, they don't post. You get an unrepresentative subject group.
[06:12] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: No, it's awesome :)
[06:13] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: do you use GIMP?
[06:13] <BHSPitLappy> hi all.
[06:13] <jtf0518> that's true, bruenig but there have been lots and lots and lots of issues.
[06:13] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Not often, but yes.
[06:13] <TGPO> I find edgy better overall than Debian Etch
[06:13] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: is anything added with edgy?
[06:13] <compudaze> [sudo] tux: edgy runs very well for me, no problems/stability issue's yet (using it on my desktop and server computers)
[06:13] <keeper> When I start firefox, it loads and just quits. Same thing for gnome-terminal. Suggestions?
[06:13] <[SUDO] Tux> compudaze: glad to hear it
[06:13] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: I wouldn't notice.
[06:13] <Celeste> thank you TGPO
[06:13] <jtf0518> it ran ok on mine although I still haven't gotten 1440x900 res with it.
[06:14] <[SUDO] Tux> Does anyone know of any differences from DD GIMP and Edgy GIMP?
[06:14] <Konnektion> is there a way to apt-get the jre on a LAMP server?
[06:14] <bruenig> jtf0518, right but again. There is no telling how many aren't having issues. Even if you were to say, hey there are a lot more posts then there were on dapper. That could very easily be chalked up to the increased user base meaning that the percentage could remain the same while the quantity went up.
[06:14] <BHSPitLappy> Using the 6.10 Desktop CD, the installer is sticking on the Partitioning Step. The dialog says "Starting up the partitioner", and it gets stuck at 50% (Scanning Disks...), though I'm still able to cancel and close the installer (meaning the program hasn't crashed, it's just not DOING anything.
[06:14] <Jordan_U> !java | Konnektion
[06:14] <ubotu> Konnektion: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[06:14] <bruenig> Konnektion, you have to enable the extra repositories
[06:14] <BHSPitLappy> HOW can I correct this, hopefully without using the Alternate CD instead.
[06:14] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: I've gotten pretty good at GIMP
[06:14] <Konnektion> ah k
[06:14] <Konnektion> ty
[06:14] <Celeste> is there a regular expression which returns JUST the IP adress of of my "ppp0" connection when I cann "ifconfig" ?
[06:14] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Do you have the PhotoShop theme for GIMP?
[06:14] <mister_roboto> Konnektion: sun-java5-bin
[06:15] <mister_roboto> Konnektion: oops... you got it
[06:15] <[SUDO] Tux> aah no spell check
[06:15] <Celeste> in the line  "inet addr:85.237.25.110  P-t-P:85.237.24.65  Mask:255.255.255.255"   just  "85.237.24.65"
=== inu|sleep is now known as inuyasharenegade
[06:15] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: No, I'm not a gimpshop fan.
[06:15] <compudaze> edgy's gimp: 2.2.13, dapper's gimp: 2.2.11
[06:15] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Is it at all like PS?
[06:16] <bruenig> Celeaste, you could do ifconfig ppp0 | grep Bcast, that would be pretty close to just the IP address. As close as I have ever figured out to get
[06:16] <jtf0518> bruenig, true enough and it is "experimental" but I think alot of people got it because they thought it would be another Dapper. Dapper was a refinement of earlier distros and much more stable when it shipped so they've been pissed off because they didn't read the fine print. Caveat Emptor.
[06:16] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U:have you ever used PS on like a Mac or Windows?
[06:16] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, you can always open a terminal/console and use fdisk
[06:16] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: I am really the wrong person to ask :)
[06:16] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: ha ok
[06:16] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: you play many games on ubuntu?
[06:17] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Yes, but no windows games.
[06:17] <graeme> bruenig: that's not valid regex ...
[06:17] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: What kind of games? FPS? RPG?
[06:17] <bruenig> graeme, ?
[06:17] <Celeste> bruenig, celeste@ubuntu:~$ ifconfig ppp0 | grep Bcas
[06:17] <Celeste> celeste@ubuntu:~$
[06:17] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: I'm not a hardcore gamer, I play Zelda, xmoto, pong...
[06:18] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Ha Zelda? do they have an emulator for super nintendo?
[06:18] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Yup, mupen64.
[06:18] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U:  wow... how do you get it?
[06:18] <bruenig> Celeste, yeah I didn't realize you had a different format. I am not to keen on networking. I do not know a way to get only the ip address
[06:18] <Celeste> bruenig, got it :)  replaces "Bcas" by "addr"
[06:18] <graeme> bruenig: sed: -e expression #1, char 4: comments don't accept any addresses
[06:19] <Rookie-> Zelda - one of the very best games ever :)
[06:19] <bruenig> graeme, did you try my command and this is an error you say?
[06:19] <Seeker2599> how do i use gparted to format my flash drive?
[06:19] <graeme> so I've updated my sources.list and it still can't find mozilla-dev in the repos .... %$#&^%
[06:19] <Celeste> bruenig, thank you
[06:19] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: http://mupen64.emulation64.com/ ( it isn't in any repo AFIK, but you don't need to compile anything, just unzip and run )
[06:19] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Good, is it good?
[06:19] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, but that doesn't help me get past that step in the installer
[06:20] <bruenig> graeme, if you could pastebin  your sources.list that would probably be best. Did you copy and paste that entire command like I said or try some other way?
[06:20] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Verry, plays both zelda's, Super Mario 64, and super smash brothers flawlessly :)
[06:20] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, with fdisk you can make the partitions, when you done that and returning to the installer you can just mount the partitions
[06:20] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, huh?
[06:20] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Wow, Really?! you gotta get each game individualy?
[06:20] <microsoft_spy> Anyone had any success with edgy video on  VIA K8M890 and VT8237A Chipset
[06:21] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, or is it the installer that makes you trubble ?
[06:21] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, are you saying it won't get stuck on that step?
[06:21] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: like from the site?
[06:21] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, right, the installer.
[06:21] <BHSPitLappy> from the live cd.
[06:21] <bruenig> !pastebin | graeme
[06:21] <ubotu> graeme: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[06:21] <lane> Where should I ask a m0n0wall question?
[06:21] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Like from Bittorrent...
[06:21] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, ahh, sorry then
[06:21] <Seeker2599> how do i format my flash drive using gparted, or is there another way to do it?
[06:21] <graeme> bruenig: just copy and pasted it ...
[06:21] <bruenig> graeme, the whole thing including the &&'s
[06:21] <graeme> yeah, cool I'll pastebin it ..
[06:21] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: You do?
[06:22] <capiCrimm> xfontsel shows no ttf fonts, any help?
[06:22] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, is the the same spot it halts on ? same package ?
[06:22] <sysdoc> Anyone running beryl get this error when starting the beryl-manager? >XGL Absent, checking for NVIDIA>beryl: No composite extension
[06:22] <graeme> bruenig: http://pastebin.ca/246433
[06:22] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, not a package... the partitioning step of the installer
[06:22] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Of course not, that would be illegal, I paid money for a doodad to download the roms onto my computer from the cartriges, thats my story and I'm stickn to it ;)
[06:22] <b33r-> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31151/ I get this error when I try to compile x-chat
[06:22] <[SUDO] Tux> well i dont want to screw anything up by having stuff open while upgrading
[06:22] <[SUDO] Tux> im out see ya all on the other side...
[06:23] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, it stops when you make the partitions ? using the installer ?
[06:23] <ayaa> i dont find screen grabbing application button in my menu
[06:23] <bruenig> graeme, are you on breezy or dapper?
[06:23] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, it stops while it's loading up the mini version of gparted that's inside the installer
[06:23] <graeme> bruenig: dapper
[06:23] <BHSPitLappy> on "scanning disks"
[06:23] <shriphani> how do i place a running process in the background ?
[06:23] <microsoft_spy>  Anyone know why video is so sluggish on edgy with VIA K8M890 and VT8237A Chipset
[06:23] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, if I start up gparted on its own, it also gets stuck scanning
[06:23] <Clinton__> shriphani: use ctrl-z and then type bg
[06:24] <graeme> bruenig: darn, the update never updated the sources.list ....
[06:24] <shriphani> Clinton__, thanks
[06:24] <QuantumG> I'm upgrading Breezy -> Edgy
[06:24] <Jordan_U> graeme: That is a good thing, your sources.list is WRONG.
[06:24] <bruenig> graeme, run the following command then, sudo sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mozilla-dev mozilla-psm
[06:24] <LinuxTitan> ok. seriously. I'm on ubuntu ce and I've done everything in my power to change the window manager
[06:24] <jtf0518> I'm seeing both those files but I had to go into Synaptic's advanced section and do a search on mozilla. It doesn't say what section it's in though. Maybe backports?
[06:24] <LinuxTitan> and it just isnt working
[06:24] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, ok, my first thought is that it is something with the disks, you have more then one disk ? or you have cd/dvd on same cable as the disk ?
[06:24] <QuantumG> I do this so I can see if the gnome cups manager has improved any
[06:25] <Seeker2599> my flash drive is empty but it says there is 691.91 mb in use how the heck to i format this!
[06:25] <Trixsey> I've been playing around a little with skins, and messed up something (I think)... Is there any way to reset desktop settings to what they used to be? (text size, background, everything)=
[06:25] <QuantumG> anyone know if it has?
[06:25] <LinuxTitan> editing xinitrc isn't working. I can't even change the default-display-manager
[06:25] <QuantumG> in particular, does it display smb error messages at all now?
[06:25] <Jordan_U> graeme: Using a breezy repo on dapper could cause problems, bruenig's command will fix that though.
[06:25] <kamui> ? realmedia
[06:25] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, just one hard drive. Not sure if it shares a controller with the optical drive, though
[06:25] <TGPO> seeker put it in then in a terminal fdisk /dev/sd(whatever it is)
[06:25] <kamui> ?? real media
[06:26] <kamui> damn it, can someone point me to the howto on howto play realmedia in ubuntu
[06:26] <kamui> ?
[06:26] <InvisiblePinkUni> why do "man bg" or "man fg" say no manual entry?
[06:26] <graeme> bruenig: Ok, I swapped breezy with dapper myself in the sources.list ...
[06:26] <TGPO> Seeker2599,  put it in then in a terminal fdisk /dev/sd(whatever it is)
[06:26] <crimsun> kamui: install realplay from dapper-commercial
[06:26] <graeme> I'll run the command anyway just to make sure ...
[06:26] <eetfunk> Can anyone tell me how to create some kind of snapshot of my virtual private server that could be restored in case I screw up while I do some changes?  Of course, I can only access the machine with SSH.
[06:26] <QuantumG> InvisiblePinkUni: cause they're internal commands of bash
[06:26] <bruenig> graeme, yeah the command will still be fine even if you already replaced
[06:27] <Seeker2599> could it be sda1 TGPO?
[06:27] <InvisiblePinkUni> QuantumG: where can i find documentation for them?
[06:27] <kamui> crimsun: how do I do that?  I don't know what dapper-commercial is
[06:27] <QuantumG> InvisiblePinkUni: man bash, /bg
[06:27] <TGPO> Seeker2599, cat /etc/fstab if sda1 isnt your hard drive its a real good chance
[06:27] <Jordan_U> bruenig: That is a good idea to use sed instead of longer instructions, I'll have to remember that.
[06:27] <crimsun> !restricted > kamui
[06:27] <kamui> crimsun: also I thought there were real video codecs that I could install to play using totem etc
[06:28] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, if it is the integrated gparted it halts on its most likely something with the disk .... i would try fisk and see what happens - as long as you dont exit that program with to use save option your ok
[06:28] <InvisiblePinkUni> QuantumG: :) thank you.
[06:28] <Trixsey> I've been playing around a little with skins, and messed up something (I think)... Is there any way to reset desktop settings to what they used to be? (text size, background, everything)?
[06:28] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, fsik*fdisk
[06:28] <bruenig> Jordan_U, after so many referrals to wiki pages, that is so much easier. Those who go to the wiki don't understand why it works anyways because it just tells you to check boxes in synaptic. So just give them the command and get it over with
[06:29] <QuantumG> yeah, FSM isn't invisible, he just aint around at the moment
[06:29] <QuantumG> that makes him better
[06:29] <Jordan_U> bruenig: Of course he is superior, he exists, here is undeniable proof: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7FcvEydqg&eurl=
[06:29] <axisys> when i press the wireless button i get this http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/3NmQix88.html
[06:29] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, odd... fdisk -l shows the partition table, but I don't get a new prompt... it's like its getting stuck as well
[06:29] <bruenig> Jordan_U, I saw that. He was on that building
[06:29] <Xenguy> Can anyone tell me why my keyboard input locks up ever night at precisely 1:06am ? (this is dapper)
[06:29] <InvisiblePinkUni> bruenig: jtf0518 : me thinks you are agents of the evil purple oyster ;)
[06:29] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, in that case i would check the cable
[06:30] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, but windows works "flawlessly"
[06:30] <bruenig> Jordan_U, but then I realized that maybe it is the christian god http://youtube.com/watch?v=OiTna_a4TCI
[06:30] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, yea, but win works on a diff. way - no need to know or tell anything to the system
[06:30] <jtf0518> somehow the words Windows and flawlessly just don't seem to go together in my experience.
[06:30] <TGPO> mine either
[06:31] <Trixsey> I've never ever seen a flawless OS :P
[06:31] <jtf0518> I've been supporting Windows since 3.0 and I've got the roids to prove it!
[06:31] <TGPO> lol
[06:31] <xeon111> i need help new to ubuntu
[06:31] <Rookie-> Trixsey, there are many .... all depence on how its configured ;)
[06:32] <TGPO> go ahead xeon111
[06:32] <Rookie-> !ask
[06:32] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:32] <xeon111> k
[06:32] <xeon111> when ever i try to access ubuntu
[06:32] <xeon111> i mean my other hard disks on ubuntu
[06:32] <xeon111> it says unable to mount drives
[06:32] <AdamKili> what arguement do i add to start a program in the tray? e.g. $  gaim --argument
[06:32] <Trixsey> Guys, I've been messing around with skins in ubuntu and it whacked out, I got huge text everywhere and stuff.. anywhere I can reset? :P
[06:32] <Jordan_U> !partitions | xeon111
[06:32] <ubotu> xeon111: Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[06:32] <_zardoz_> how would I update glibc from 2.3 to 2.4?
[06:33] <Jordan_U> !ntfs | xeon
[06:33] <QuantumG> _zardoz_: painfully
[06:33] <xeon111> can i access them without formatting them
[06:33] <freemind>  hello, I am trying to boot with a ramdisk and get: Mounting none on /proc failed: No such file or directory .. the procfs is enabled in the kernel, what could be wrong?
[06:33] <Jordan_U> xeon111: Sorry, gave you the wrong link at first :)
[06:33] <kamui> crimsun: thanks, looks like I already had rm set up to play, just had to use xine instead of totem
[06:33] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, I ran fdisk, then just did "w"; Now I ran gparted, and it's still "stuck" on Scanning all devices, but I can hear hard disk usage...
[06:33] <bruenig> AdamKili, if it is possible it would depend on the program. do gaim -h, to see what the arguments are
[06:33] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, maybe it's just painfully slow.
[06:34] <xeon111> er is there any other way wthout formatting
[06:34] <TGPO> xeon yes, scroll back and read the help files that were listed for you
[06:34] <Trixsey> Rookie-: I've been messing around with skins in ubuntu and it whacked out, I got huge text everywhere and stuff.. anywhere I can reset? :P
[06:34] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, sounds strange ! i have 3 puters with 3 diff. dists and none have that prob ...
[06:34] <Jordan_U> xeon111: Yes there is, there is no need to format, I gave you the wrong link when it talked about formatting.
[06:35] <Rookie-> Trixsey, im not so good at GUI things ... sorry
[06:35] <AdamKili> bruenig thanks no argument is listed that's what I need
[06:35] <Trixsey> oh ok
[06:35] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, I've had many probs with this particular step, on dapper AND edgy.  I usually just use the alternate CD
[06:35] <graeme> Is there any proper Internet TV for linux ?
[06:35] <BHSPitLappy> !info democracytv
[06:35] <graeme> I don't really like democracy player ... :-)
[06:35] <bruenig> AdamKili, mine opens in the tray only by itself for whatever reason
[06:35] <BHSPitLappy> ah
[06:35] <ubotu> Package democracytv does not exist in any distro I know
[06:35] <AdamKili> bruenig: weird
[06:35] <bruenig> AdamKili, do you have automatic login, that is probably necessary
[06:35] <graeme> BHSPitLappy: it doens't have any proper channels. Just some video/podcast homemade kinda things ...
[06:35] <AdamKili> no
[06:36] <graeme> that's no good, I want to watch live rugby ...
[06:36] <bruenig> AdamKili, yeah it has to prompt you if you don't have auto login
[06:36] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, report it as a bug - or atleast mention it to the staff what you have occuried
[06:36] <AdamKili> bruenig: oh well i wont worry about it. others use my comp sometimes so no auto-login, and besides it's nice to know who's online anyway
[06:36] <bruenig> graeme, democracy is terrible, I will agree with you there
[06:37] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, the console I got from gparted is def. interesting. Something about a loop, which explains a lot.
[06:37] <Jordan_U> xeon111: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[06:37] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, loop ? what kind of loop ? loop of gparted ?
[06:37] <graeme> bruenig: it's a waste of time,
[06:37] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, yeah.
[06:37] <bruenig> graeme, what do you mean internet tv. If you want to view flash videos or other imbedded stuff, you can do that in firefox. If you want to torrent stuff, you can do that and view it with totem or another media player. There is no need for that super app
[06:37] <xeon111> thx
[06:37] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, I'll get it again in a minute.
[06:38] <xeon111> i will try it
[06:38] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, i would be very careful at this moment ... risk for the disk
[06:38] <graeme> bruenig: well I have a need for a proper TV channel surfer, kinda like that one ... <babo can't remember the name of the windows one>
[06:38] <BHSPitLappy> Rookie-, I'm going with the Alternate Cd
[06:39] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, im at the channel but might be afk
[06:39] <jtf0518> now if we could just get the developers to make a DirectX emulator for Wine we could play all the cool games that'll only run on Windows.
[06:39] <bruenig> graeme, maybe it is one of those things you need once you have used it. I have never used any of those for any amount of time.
[06:39] <[SUDO] Tux> hey jordan_u?
[06:39] <graeme> bruenig: well, I'd like to watch HBO and international sports ..
[06:40] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U:  What was the name of that N64 Emulator?
[06:40] <jtf0518> mupen64
[06:40] <[SUDO] Tux> thanks
[06:40] <QuantumG> sorry, I missed the start of the conversation, graeme are you after a hardware recommendation for a tv card for linux?
[06:40] <graeme> what's the best way to uninstall a .deb package ?
[06:40] <khaije1> jtf0518: cedega has this, but are you sure wine doesn't?
[06:40] <Rookie-> http://mupen64.emulation64.com/
[06:41] <jtf0518> not sure, khaije1
[06:41] <graeme> QuantumG: nope, I just wanted a app so I could channel surf. Not interested in any extra hardware. Just an internet based thingy ...
[06:41] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: How do i get a game for it?
[06:41] <graeme> What's the name of hte windows one ?
[06:41] <tonyyarusso> graeme: apt-get remove packagename, or any of the other apt interfaces
[06:41] <QuantumG> "channel surf"
[06:41] <QuantumG> wtf does that mean?
[06:42] <jtf0518> QuantumG, do you happen to have any recommendations for a TV Tuner card for Linux?
[06:42] <[SUDO] Tux> JTF0518: how do u get games for it?
[06:42] <Rookie-> jumping in channels on irc ?
[06:42] <cablesm102> Is anybody having trouble with GTK themes on Edgy? Whenever I install one, controls just appear plain, like Windows 9x sort of.
[06:42] <QuantumG> jtf0518: nah, was just trying to understand what graeme was talking about
[06:43] <graeme> tonyyarusso: but that's only if it was install by synaptic or the repos right ? ... I downloaded a .deb and install it with dpkg
[06:43] <blanky> hey guys, what's the correct line
[06:43] <b33r-> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31151/ I get this error when I try to compile x-chat can anyone help?
[06:43] <blanky> /etc/initr.d/sshd restart ?
[06:43] <graeme> What's the name of the Internet P2P TV network ?
[06:43] <tonyyarusso> graeme: Nope, you can remove any deb that way.
[06:43] <Despised> can anyone recommend a place to start programming on linux?
[06:43] <[SUDO] Tux> How do i start to get games for Mupen64?
[06:43] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Mupen64 , you have to look on bittorrent.
[06:44] <QuantumG> graeme: dpkg deinstall blah.deb is probably what you're after
[06:44] <Jordan_U> Despised: python.org
[06:44] <eck> Despised: in what language?
[06:44] <xeon111> er where do i execute the mounting script
[06:44] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: Whats bittorrent?
[06:44] <Despised> any language is good with me
[06:44] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: It is like limewire but for more than music.
[06:44] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, you need to download ROMs
[06:44] <cablesm102> this is usually illegal
[06:45] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: How do i run it?
[06:45] <graeme> QuantumG: there is no dpkg uninstall command ....
[06:45] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, it should be preinstalled in Ubuntu
[06:45] <xeon111> where do i execute the diskmount script
[06:45] <wm_eddie> Is the maintainer of the pydance package around?
[06:45] <xeon111> where and how do i execute diskmount script
[06:45] <[SUDO] Tux> How do i open it?
[06:45] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, you can go to a torrent site like piratebay.org to look for .torrent files of N64 ROMs. It's illegal to download ROMs though.
[06:46] <eck> Despised: if you want to do real unix/linux hacking try to find some older unix programming books, if you want to try python or something not C then any book will do (there won't be as much OS specific things)
[06:46] <QuantumG> it's deinstall
[06:46] <DanielV> Ubuntu 6, Allegro library not running WINDOWED mode with compiled package. Followed the same steps on FC5 and runs windowed mode perfect. Any suggestion?
[06:46] <graeme> tonyyarusso: nope, it just tells me that it can't find it ...
[06:46] <[SUDO] Tux> How can i run it. I think i've seen it before?
[06:47] <tonyyarusso> graeme: ... apt-cache policy packagename will report debs installed that way
[06:47] <eck> at my school there are tons of unix books in the libraries that have everything I needed to learn to learn about the posix interfaces
[06:47] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, any .torrent file should automatically open in Bittorrent
[06:47] <QuantumG> dpkg -r pkg.deb sorry
[06:47] <Seeker2599> is there a way i can turn a folder into a zip or rar file?
[06:47] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, here's a good article on what BitTorrent is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent
[06:47] <QuantumG> --purge if you want to remove configuration files as well
[06:48] <Jordan_U> Seeker2599: Right click on it and go to "create archive"
[06:48] <cablesm102> Seeker2599, Ubuntu comes with an archiving program.
[06:48] <graeme> graeme@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ sudo dpkg -r democracy*
[06:48] <graeme> dpkg: you must specify packages by their own names, not by quoting the names of the files they come in
[06:48] <xeon111> er im asking something if any one is free please answer it
[06:48] <xeon111> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[06:48] <xeon111> the script given how can i run it
[06:48] <[SUDO] Tux> Cablesm102: I'm confused...
[06:49] <Seeker2599> ty cablesm102
[06:49] <graeme> actually on second thoughts, I think I'll just forget about uninstalling it...
[06:49] <cablesm102> [SUDO] Tux, can I PM you?
[06:49] <QuantumG> hehe
[06:49] <[SUDO] Tux> cablesm102: how?
[06:49] <graeme> how does something so easy become so complicated ... :-(
[06:49] <xeon111> ....
[06:50] <QuantumG> yeah, that's the joy of using command line tools
[06:50] <t3m17> how do you get google video to work with swiftfox in edgy eft?
[06:50] <Jordan_U> xeon111: Just open the terminal and type the commands given.
[06:50] <compudaze> graeme: what r u trying to uninstall?
[06:50] <graeme> compudaze: democracytv
[06:50] <graeme> not from the repos ...
=== Vich|Away is now known as Vich
[06:51] <xeon111> thx Atlast i fund
[06:51] <xeon111> sry
[06:51] <xeon111> found out
[06:51] <compudaze> a deb u manually installed?
[06:51] <graeme> compudaze: yes,
[06:51] <compudaze> what was the filename?
[06:51] <Volodya> http://www.xnview.com
[06:51] <DanielV> Whats the name of the Audio Codec used with MPGs?
[06:51] <drunkpikachu> does anyone here know a solution to the beryl splash screen -> white nothing desktop issue?
[06:52] <Jordan_U> drunkpikachu: Try #beryl or #ubuntu-xgl
[06:52] <graeme> So basically I"m just trying to get a cool system up with various pieces of useful software so I can hand it off to a non-techie friend. I'm thinking though, that sadly, Linux still isn't really there yet in this regard ... :-( .
[06:52] <drunkpikachu> Jordan_U: thanks
[06:53] <graeme> compudaze:  democracyplayer_0.9.1-1ubuntupcf_i386.deb
[06:53] <MrKeuner> hi, I saw a utility application for gnome for renaming multiple files, I cannot remember its name
[06:53] <compudaze> try, sudo apt-get remove democracyplayer
[06:53] <fyrestrtr> graeme: depends on your definition of 'various pieces of useful software'.
[06:53] <xeon111> yaaay
[06:53] <graeme> Although I'll also say, that for my work, I wouldn't be without linux for an afternoon even ...
[06:53] <DanielV> graeme useful software is not too much friendly, is directed to useful people
[06:53] <xeon111> thx for the support
[06:53] <fyrestrtr> graeme: apt-get remove --purge democracyplayer should do it.
[06:53] <Jordan_U> xeon111: No problem :)
[06:54] <compudaze> --purge removes the config files if u want (if any)
[06:54] <saleh> how could i start writing openGL program and how to compile?
[06:54] <Xenguy> MrKeuner: dunno, but there's krename, and even rename (CLI)
[06:54] <connie_lh> Hi. Does anyone here have any experience with mdadm? I have a previously created array and have no idea how to initialize it.
[06:54] <QuantumG> meh, I tend to agree graeme, but I don't think you should draw that conclusion from using command line tools
=== VHockey86_ is now known as VHockey86
[06:54] <MrKeuner> Xenguy: there is mrename but that one I saw had a gui
[06:54] <graeme> DanielV: ?
[06:54] <Shadow_mil> I am making a ubuntu wallpaper logo... what color would be ubuntu's "color"  That tan color?
[06:55] <Rookie-> blue or lightblue
[06:55] <Xenguy> MrKeuner: if you want a gui, krename works nicely
[06:55] <xeon111> now second thing
[06:55] <QuantumG> I draw that conclusion from trying to print a file 3 hours ago and still not being able to get it to work.
[06:55] <graeme> fyrestrtr: OK, that did it thanks ...
[06:55] <xeon111> i need sound drivers
[06:55] <Shadow_mil> Hmm
[06:55] <saleh> how could i start writing openGL program and how to compile?
[06:55] <saleh> how could i start writing openGL program and how to compile?
[06:55] <xeon111> my sound card is a soundblaster 16
[06:55] <MrKeuner> Xenguy: thanks but I am a Gnome guy
[06:55] <QuantumG> (after using the gui tools, AND hacking config files myself).
[06:55] <compudaze> xeon111: isa/
[06:55] <compudaze> ?
[06:55] <Shadow_mil> Ill make something up and see what you think of it... I do like blue
[06:55] <bradley> does anyone know if it is possible to set up a nvidia card with two distinct monitors/desktops instead of the twinview one desktop over multiple monitors?
[06:55] <fyrestrtr> Shadow_mil: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Official
[06:55] <Xenguy> MrKeuner: I run gnome desktop and use krename - where's the problem? :-)
[06:56] <connie_lh> bradley: Yes. It's simple.
[06:56] <wm_eddie> saleh: openGL is too complex for newbies, try looking at pygame first or something. http://www.pygame.org
[06:56] <QuantumG> bradley: yep, with much xorg.conf hacking foo
[06:56] <connie_lh> bradley: Just don't use twinview. And set up two screens.
[06:56] <bradley> connie_lh, QuantumG  is there a good example or howto somewhere?
[06:57] <bradley> i've checked out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaTVOut
[06:57] <QuantumG> probably, but I don't know how sorry, saw it a year or more ago
[06:57] <saleh> wm_eddie: i'm student and this sem we r learning openGL as computer graphic
[06:57] <[sYn] > bradley, what benefit would it bring over using TwinView?
[06:57] <connie_lh> bradley: Same setup as a xinerama minus the xinerama flag.
[06:57] <fyrestrtr> saleh: find a programming language that you like, and then read up on its opengl bindings.
[06:58] <DanielV> Here is a joke a friend told me. Guy A- Hey bring me a sandwich,  Guy B.- No way, you do it, Guy A.- sudo bring me a sandwich, Guy B.- Yes sir!
[06:58] <saleh> wm_eddie: i installed ubuntu 2days ago and donno what to do...
[06:58] <ClayG> whats the best distro for a old computer?
[06:58] <ClayG> non-live (no dsl)
[06:58] <bradley> sYn, it would allow me to use beryl easier and not have my desktop picture disappear and i could trun off the projector without losing half my desktop
[06:58] <fyrestrtr> ClayG: any compile-from-source distro, like gentoo.
[06:58] <eck> ClayG: I don't think its a distro issue, probably more about what desktop environment and apps
[06:58] <Jordan_U> ClayG: depending on how old, xubuntu
[06:59] <ClayG> i was thinkiung gentoo
[06:59] <connie_lh> clayg: I'm with fyrestrtr
[06:59] <ClayG> didnt know if it was hard to install
[06:59] <MrKeuner> Xenguy: It takes longer for KDE application to run under gnome
[06:59] <eck> gentoo will be a pita unless you do distcc
[06:59] <wm_eddie> saleh: the openGL package is called mesa in Linux
[06:59] <connie_lh> clayg: With the handbook it's cake.
[06:59] <bradley> connie_lh, great i will search for a xinerama howto and do some trial and error
[06:59] <saleh> wm_eddie: we use C++ in windows and codeblocks to write openGL program
[06:59] <Jordan_U> ClayG: Just be ready for days of commpiling....
[06:59] <fyrestrtr> ClayG: they have improved the install process recently.
[06:59] <saleh> oh...
[06:59] <saleh> ok
[06:59] <ClayG> what is distcc?
[06:59] <[sYn] > bradley, Ah! not using 2 monitors side by side :)..  I asked the question out of curiosity as I'm running twinview now and can't see the benefits of not base don the fact that I have 2 monitors right next to each other :)
[06:59] <compudaze> ClayG: u basicly follow step by step on the install
[06:59] <eck> distcc lets you compile your apps on a faster computer
[06:59] <Borat> hey guys, whenever i start emerald themer 1.1 it freezes, does anyone know how to fix this?
[06:59] <compudaze> ClayG: pretty easy, but if u want to run X get ready for days of compiling
[07:00] <saleh> so i should indtall mesa and then compile ???
[07:00] <xeon111> how can i install drivers for my sound blaster 16 soundcard
[07:00] <fyrestrtr> ClayG: distributed c compiler (I think). Allows many computers to simultaneously compile a program.
[07:00] <wm_eddie> saleh: Try looking for the mesa-dev packages in System>Administration>Synaptic Package Manager
[07:00] <eck> but honestly, gentoo will not make your applications any faster
[07:00] <crimsun> xeon111: sudo modprobe snd-sb16
[07:00] <bradley> sYn, yeah i imagine it is great for lots of stuff but i only need it to watch movies. :)
[07:00] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: i need some help!
[07:00] <xeon111> thanks
[07:00] <crimsun> xeon111: what does that command (in a terminal) do?
[07:00] <xeon111> crimsun i ll try that
[07:00] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Sure.
[07:00] <eck> if there were any tangible speed benefits from using custom use flags, the packagers for whatever distro you are using would be using them in the spec file
[07:00] <wm_eddie> saleh: Also make sure you have the build-essential package installed too.
[07:00] <[sYn] > bradley, Well good luck on your search, sorry I can't be of any help :(!
[07:01] <connie_lh> mdadm experience... anyone?
[07:01] <xeon111> nothing
[07:01] <saleh> wm_eddie: thx, and after insstalling that i just normally compile? like other c++programs?
[07:01] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: one sec...
[07:01] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: ok... how do i get ROMS?
[07:01] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: can i PM you?
[07:01] <bradley> [sYn] , no problem.
[07:02] <wm_eddie> saleh: build-essential will install everything you need to compile C/C++ programs.  You might need to install a few more -dev packages to comile against the libraries.
[07:02] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: Yes, you can pm me, but you need to be registered to pm.
[07:02] <bony> i followed all the instructions for making a commarcial dvd to play on my laptop. inspite of everything getting installed properly on the system i am unable to play it. can any one suggest a solution for this ?
[07:02] <xeon111> crimsun: it seems it did nothing
[07:02] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: can u see my posts?
[07:02] <Staz> Hi, fglrx is a ATI graphics driver. Then what is "ati"?
[07:02] <compudaze> bony, install libdvdcss2?
[07:02] <wm_eddie> saleh: But wich -dev package you need depends on the library you are using.  If you are only using openGL then the mesa-dev packages should be all you need.
[07:02] <crimsun> xeon111: excellent. What does ``asoundconf list'' return?
[07:02] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: i can see yers
[07:02] <bony> compudaze, yes i did that
[07:02] <Xenguy> bony: try vlc
[07:02] <Jordan_U> [SUDO] Tux: No, you need to register on freenode.
[07:03] <bony> Xenguy, i will try that
[07:03] <compudaze> vlc is good
[07:03] <[sYn] > vlc is the best :D
[07:03] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U: i was just PMing cable
[07:03] <[SUDO] Tux> thats odd
[07:03] <QuantumG> I get my roms from ROMNation, it owns
[07:03] <Tokenbad> ok I made a huge mistake and wonder if can fix it without doing a whole reinstall...I had a var dir on my slave drive for vms from vmware....and I wanted to remove it...so did sudo rm -r /var/
[07:04] <Tokenbad> and it did the var from my OS disk...
[07:04] <bony> but my point is that i used to play dvds with brezee badger 5.10 there was no problem. it was after i upgraded to dapper that i am facing this problem :-(
[07:04] <fyrestrtr> Tokenbad: lol
[07:04] <Tokenbad> is there a way to replace the files there
[07:04] <bony> i use totem for playing cd's or dvd's

[07:11] <graeme> Why is bootpc listening on foreign ports over udp ?
[07:11] <techNiKal> is there any way to make my ubunt dapper secure and allow only one service samba to be enabled ?
[07:11] <freemind> thank you, I will try that now
[07:11] <graeme> vanilla dapper install ?
[07:11] <xeon111> where can i get decoders
[07:11] <cable_guy> hi
[07:11] <Acura> is there an easy way to remove all programs except those that were in installed with the operating system?
[07:11] <Xenguy> !codecs > xeon111
[07:11] <xeon111> it says i need decoders to pay mp3 files
[07:11] <fyrestrtr> techNiKal: use can use update-rc.d or bum (boot up manager) to control what services start at startup. Some are needed though (like a cron process).
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> Acura: re-install the system.
[07:12] <Despised> does anyone know how to get input from the user in python?
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> xeon111: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[07:12] <eck> Despised: raw_input()
[07:12] <fyrestrtr> Despised: folks in #python might :)
[07:12] <Despised> oh alright thanks
[07:12] <techNiKal> fyrestrtr do you have any tutorial about ubuntu security or what you just said ?
[07:12] <Acura> fyrestrtr, without reinstalling it (because something is crashign when i try to do taht)
[07:12] <eetfunk> dpkg --purge doesnt seem to remove the config files and apt-get doesnt create new ones.  Any other ides?
[07:12] <Clubbed> hi, when I try to install the nVidia drivers it says I am running server X and that to install them I need to be out of server X, how do i do that?
[07:13] <eck> Despised: if you want to learn python, I recommend the apress book
[07:13] <fyrestrtr> techNiKal: no, I don't know of a tutorial (manage to secure it "manually") but I'm sure there is something at the ubuntu wiki -- have you tried there already?
[07:13] <fyrestrtr> Acura: what error message do you get?
[07:13] <cable_guy> is there an easy, safe way to install flash player 9 beta on ubuntu edgy?
[07:13] <fyrestrtr> Clubbed: ctrl+alt+f1, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, then type the command to run the installer.
[07:13] <KingOfNowhere> yeah flash player 9 is easy to install
[07:14] <Clubbed> thank you
[07:14] <fyrestrtr> Clubbed: oh you must also login first.
[07:14] <fyrestrtr> ctrl+alt+f1, login, then ....
[07:14] <Acura> fyrestrtr, it says Uncompressing Linux, then   [xxxx.xx]  timeout waiting for dma, or something similar to that
[07:14] <cable_guy> KingOfNowhere: where can i get it?
[07:14] <fyrestrtr> Acura: you can disable dma.
[07:14] <DanielV>  /join #electronics
[07:14] <eck> cable_guy: back up the old so file, and replace it with the new one... it is fiarly safe/easy
[07:15] <fyrestrtr> Acura: do you already have linux installed?
[07:15] <bony> its working i just tried to play a dvd and i could play it perfectly even with dvd menus. but now i have a problem regarding brightness and contrast of the video. the video is very bright. i tried to set the settings that are there in totems dislpay option but is there any auto process using which i could set the brightness and contrast fo the video?
[07:15] <Acura> fyrestrtr, yea, but i wanted to install a clean version over the top
[07:16] <fyrestrtr> well if you are after a clean version, the easiest way is to reinstall the system. If you install on top, no guarantees of cleanliness.
[07:17] <KingOfNowhere> cable_guy: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html - Download link
[07:17] <fyrestrtr> Acura: if you have some spare disk space, create another partition, mount it as /home, copy all your user files and then reinstall the base system. This way you won't delete your documents and user settings.
[07:18] <Acura> ok will do
[07:19] <KingOfNowhere> cable_guy: download the player and move the 'libflashplayer.so' file into the approriate directory (for firefox it is /usr/lib/firefox/plugins)
[07:19] <fyrestrtr> and as for your dma problem, you can disable dma from either your bios, or by the /nodma (or similar, forgot the exact command) switch at the boot: prompt (you'll need the alternate install cd for it)
[07:20] <FantasticFoo> will this work for getting compiz on dapper? http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Xgl-Compiz-Dapper
[07:21] <FantasticFoo> or is it going to screw something up
[07:22] <Mantice> How to I install the ATI.com drivers for edgy ???
[07:22] <james_> my titlebars are dissapearing when I enable xgl.... darn you delicious, buggy alpha software :)
[07:23] <Vich> ubuntu is too easy to setup
[07:23] <Vich> I don't feel a sense of accomplishment having installed ubuntu and gotten everything working
[07:23] <FantasticFoo> Vich: i know what you mean. heheh
[07:24] <Vich> I mean, even got the extra buttons on my logitech keyboard working
[07:24] <Vich> AND my digital speakers
[07:24] <eternalswd> I just uninstalled fglrx.  I'd like to try the open source alternative.  What is the package name for the ati driver?
[07:24] <Vich> my only gripe is that my webcam (logitech quickcam im) light comes on at startup and stays on
[07:24] <fyrestrtr> eternalswd: its already installed, just change 'fglrx' to 'ati' in xorg.conf
[07:24] <sysdoc> Vich, Sucks don't it?? lol
[07:24] <Mantice> Can some one help me install the drivers off ATI.com ????
[07:25] <Vich> it's only supposed to come on when I'm using it
[07:25] <Vich> so I get paranoid that people are watching me
[07:25] <eternalswd> fyrestrtr, thanks
[07:25] <Vich> running a webcam app then closing said app turns the light off
[07:25] <Vich> in fact, the webcam (of course) works great
[07:25] <Vich> but if there was a way I could stop it starting up, that would be awesome
[07:26] <Vich> like stop it initializing or whatever it's doing
[07:26] <fyrestrtr> only plug it in when you are using it.
[07:26] <Vich> that is one solution
[07:26] <Vich> but alike my current solution of running and closing a webcam program
[07:26] <Vich> it's too cumbersome
[07:27] <FantasticFoo> Vich: i know how to give yourself a sense of accomplishment.
[07:27] <Vich> figure out how to solve this myself?
[07:27] <james_> Get xgl working, that should give you a sense of accomplishment
[07:27] <shrndegruv> is there a guide to enabling hibernate on laptops?
[07:28] <Vich> xgl eh?
[07:28] <james_> lol the 3D graphics, wobbling windows, that sort
[07:28] <FantasticFoo> Vich: nope. get xgl/compiz running without screwing up your entire machine
[07:28] <james_> Yep!
[07:28] <james_> I just uninstalled all the components
[07:28] <Vich> lol
[07:28] <james_> I'm tired of trying every method imagineable and getting nowhere
[07:28] <FantasticFoo> yeah, it's ridiculously impossible
[07:28] <Vich> I'll try that later
[07:29] <james_> I want my wobbly windows :(
[07:29] <fyrestrtr> if that's accomplishment, then I must feel like a king because I have it working on dual screens -- yet, I don't.
[07:29] <FantasticFoo> james_: i actually did have it working before
[07:29] <FantasticFoo> james_: it's really cool
[07:29] <sysdoc> FantasticFoo, I just got it installed this evening, wasn't bad at all
[07:29] <james_> bah!
[07:29] <FantasticFoo> sysdoc: on dapper or what?
[07:29] <james_> how'd you do it sysdoc?
[07:29] <sysdoc> yup
[07:29] <james_> i'm on edgy
[07:29] <FantasticFoo> sysdoc: please tell me what tutorial you followed. :|
[07:29] <Vich> I am also on edgy
[07:30] <hentai> I'm pretty edgy myself. too much coffee i suppose...
[07:30] <james_> haha

[07:30] <Vich> you japanese pervert you

[07:30] <Staz> I think I buggered up xorg.conf and it wont load. How can I get back into ubuntu and replace it with the backup I made?
[07:30] <sysdoc> FantasticFoo, hang on getting it now
[07:31] <sysdoc> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingBeryl
[07:31] <james_> I'm on edgy, using nvidia drivers
[07:31] <hentai> SAME
[07:31] <hentai> oops, left cruise control on
[07:32] <james_> so sysdoc, install xgl first, then follow this?
[07:32] <fyrestrtr> Staz: ctrl+alt+f1, login, then sudo cp backup-xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[07:32] <hentai> my external hdd is mounted as a vfat filesystem, and it says root owns it. but root can't change the permissions so that everyone can write to it. what can i do to fix this problem?
[07:32] <graeme> is videolan in the repos ?
[07:32] <FantasticFoo> sysdoc: oh, thanks!!
[07:32] <Staz> fyrestrtr : I cant get past the progress bar screen
[07:32] <hentai> graeme: vlc media player is, if that's what you're asking.
[07:32] <Staz> ie : ctrl f1 wont work
[07:32] <bony> i am unable to play a vcd
[07:33] <Staz> ctrl+alt+f1*
[07:33] <sysdoc> james_, I installed the newest nvidia driver then> this one to get Xgl in the session chooser> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl#head-b9d0ad31fc5a1f8cd66c5d871d27f01cfa27d137
[07:33] <fyrestrtr> Staz: sounds like something else is happening. What was the last thing you did?
[07:33] <Staz> I only edited xorg.conf
[07:33] <hentai> what did you edit in xorg.conf?
[07:33] <blanky> is there a way I can change my local ip address
[07:34] <shrndegruv> guys doc for getting hibernate functionality on a laptop?
[07:34] <hentai> blanky, are you behind a router?
[07:34] <sysdoc> I actually used like 5 different pages, if ya want them pm me
[07:34] <fyrestrtr> Staz: reboot the system, activate the grub menu (hit esc quickly). Then, edit the boot entry for your kernel and remove the 'quiet' line, then boot with it and see where its hanging.
[07:34] <Staz> I had two "Device" sections. I removed one and replace the driver in the other one with "fglrx" (stypid I know)
[07:34] <blanky> hentai, yeah, it's becuase my windows lan address is different from my linux and all my things on my router aren't applying to me
[07:34] <sysdoc> shrndegruv, you looking for suspend2?
[07:35] <hentai> ah, if you use gnome go to System > Administration > Networking and configure your device
[07:35] <shrndegruv> is that how i get the laptop to suspend?
[07:35] <sysdoc> shrndegruv, well that is one wy to do it yea
[07:35] <blanky> hentai, sorry, im on kde, you know how to do it that way?
[07:36] <shrndegruv> yeah where are the docs for the different options?
[07:36] <Staz> fyrestrtr : I removed quiet line, but nothing changed when I booted
[07:36] <hentai> blanky, sorry, no clue. other than editing /etc/network/interfaces
[07:36] <fyrestrtr> Staz: you need to boot with the change (hit b to boot with the edited line). If you just edit it and reboot, it boots with the default settings.
[07:36] <blanky> hentai, I could just edit that?
[07:36] <sysdoc> shrndegruv, see this forum page and then search around for your laptop http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=135
[07:36] <hentai> blanky, i don't see what's stopping you.
[07:37] <Staz> fyrestrtr : I did that
[07:37] <blanky> hentai, I'll try thanks
[07:37] <shrndegruv> thanx
[07:37] <shrndegruv> :q
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> Staz: if you still saw the progress bar, then it didn't boot with your change.
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> Staz: boot in recovery mode, that should atleast give you a working console.
[07:38] <hentai> someone please help me change the permissions of my external drive. it won't let the owner (root) change the permissions so all users can write to it.
[07:38] <fyrestrtr> hentai: remont the drive with umask=0777
[07:39] <fyrestrtr> s/remont/remount
[07:39] <graeme_> can anyone help me troubleshoot sound for dapper ?
[07:39] <Staz> fyrestrtr ; Its very strange I follow your exact instructions but boot does not change at all.
[07:39] <Staz> how can I boot in recovery mode?
[07:39] <blanky> hentai, it says # DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
[07:39] <fyrestrtr> Staz: there should be a menu entry in grub for a recovery console.
[07:39] <graeme> I can't get the sound to work on my dapper ...
[07:41] <crimsun> graeme: ``asoundconf list'' (in a terminal)
[07:41] <hentai> blanky, that's probably there for a reason >_>

[07:41] <graeme> crimsun: Names of available sound cards:
[07:41] <graeme> CMI8738

[07:42] <crimsun> graeme: and is any sound audible?
[07:42] <james_> well, as you can see

[07:42] <blanky> time flew, it feels like just yesterday when 6.06 was released
[07:42] <hentai> blanky, probably not. i just used the gnome gui to configure my settings
[07:43] <hentai> fyrestrtr: how do i add umask to the mount command?
[07:43] <lastnode> heikki, umask=000 for example

[07:53] <hentai> arg, that didn't help at all
[07:53] <thor> pricklysponge: the bar is there in xchat...move to the left edge of the scrollbar, hold the mouse left button, and move the cursor to the left. This will make the chat window smaller, but will also enlarge the user list
[07:53] <hentai> i mounted /dev/sdd1 with umask=0777 and it told me that not even root can view what's in the folder.
[07:53] <thor> pricklysponge: that should read the 'right' edge of the scrollbar
[07:53] <villr[] ye> um... anyone here use a web interface to log on to a wireless network.
[07:53] <graeme> crimsun: nope that doens't work either I'm afraid ...
[07:53] <pricklysponge> thre got it :D
[07:54] <Rookie-> to see what fps is with glxgears - what the option on that ?
[07:54] <capi_> xfontsel doesn't show me all the fonts, ttf are mainly missing.
[07:54] <pricklysponge> lol thanks a bunch :)
[07:54] <crimsun> graeme: pastebin your /proc/asound/card0/codec*/*
[07:54] <AdamKili> help i'm following instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-6c942d1939d97331f96e42b63774003fde7daed5 i run the first command, it tries to connect, then times out. can anyone help? also the Canonical repository doesn't work when following those instructions
[07:54] <crimsun> graeme: back in 1 hr
[07:54] <oht> how do you add a refresh rate to the xorg.conf file?
[07:54] <c0re^> hey, is there a ubuntu with the 2.6.1.8 kernel already compiled and useable?
[07:54] <crimsun> c0re^: if you mean 2.6.18, no.
[07:54] <oht> (it's only giving 75 hz for my monitor, but i usually run it at 60hz)
[07:54] <crimsun> c0re^: and there is no Ubuntu release with 2.6.1.
[07:54] <graeme> the sound on my dapper doesn't work ? can anyone help ?
[07:55] <c0re^> crimsun: i thought someone said the nightly worked for the jmicron sata controller
[07:55] <c0re^> thats why i need it. the current kernel doesnt support my harddrive.
[07:55] <crimsun> c0re^: meaning a snap of 2.6.19?
[07:55] <srankin> henta: I thought umaskl used octals
[07:55] <c0re^> crimsun: meaning something that will work with my stat controller
[07:56] <c0re^> crimsun: sata*
[07:56] <crimsun> c0re^: I need specifics.
[07:56] <hentai> srankin: explain
[07:56] <Rookie-> to see what fps is with glxgears - what the option on that ?
[07:56] <bony> thor, i am able to play dvds but vcds are not getting played vlc is able to play few of them but i want totem to play the cds. when i had brezee i had no problem playing any thing weather its a dvd or vcd but i am facing lot of problems with the new version
[07:56] <c0re^> crimsun: like my sata controller?
[07:56] <graeme> I'm really not very happy with my dapper install ...
[07:56] <crimsun> c0re^: no, like the kernel you're referring to
[07:56] <Mantice> fyrestrty: I still get same message.
[07:57] <c0re^> crimsun: the kernel im referring to is 2.6.18 which has support for my sata controller
[07:57] <graeme> If I'd just installed windows, I'd be outside enjoying the sunshine at this stage ...
[07:57] <crimsun> c0re^: we don't -- at all -- ship 2.6.18.
=== xnull- is now known as znull
[07:57] <c0re^> crimsun: someone said some nightly had it
[07:58] <crimsun> c0re^: then either point me to this mysterious nightly, or give me a reference to whom
[07:58] <Vich> what is beryl?
[07:58] <Vich> is that like xgl?
[07:58] <hentai> beryl is a window manager that goes with xgl to make it do all the cool stuff it does
[07:59] <Vich> awesome
[07:59] <Vich> I'm installing that now
[07:59] <thor> anyone know how to remove the 'on top' property from the toolbars in gnome?
[07:59] <hentai> right click the titlebar
[07:59] <chapium> thor, there might be an option in gnome-conf
[07:59] <c0re^> crimsun: im looking for the nightly myself. it was on some random forum i found on google. two other distributions ive tried that has 2.6.18 run, but wont install due to not finding disks or my harddrive isnt seen.
[08:00] <Vich> brb
[08:00] <AsheD> why can't I edit /etc/sudoers ?
[08:00] <abes> Hey everyone! I have a volume issue. I have function keyes that put the volume up and down and indeed a little bar appears showing it going down and up, but that's "Headphone" volume so the main volume doesnt change at all - how can i change it?
[08:00] <c0re^> crimsun: i use the asus p5b deluxe wifi ap ed
[08:00] <thor> chapium: I thought gnome-conf was a command...but it doesn't respond
[08:00] <c0re^> crimsun: for my mobo
[08:00] <chapium> thor: I cant remember what its called.  I think its gconf or something
[08:00] <graeme> The alsaconf command doens't respond to anything ?
[08:01] <chapium> thor, gconf-editor
[08:01] <thor> chapium: yup...just found it
[08:01] <wraithsoul> hey
[08:01] <crimsun> c0re^: there seems to be a communication breakdown. We don't ship a 2.6.18 at all. There's 6.10's 2.6.17 or 7.04's 2.6.19.
[08:02] <hentai> i fixed it!
[08:02] <crimsun> graeme: we don't ship alsaconf in alsa-utils; it was removed in Hoary.
[08:02] <c0re^> crimsun: oh, i understand, well i just want any kernel that supports my sata controller or allows me to install, im assuming 2.8.19 will?
[08:02] <hentai> sudo mount -t vfat -o defaults,uid=hentai,gid=hentai /dev/sdd1 /media/LACIE
[08:02] <wraithsoul> I am trying to get pydance to work, and it does not. and I hear that someone already bothered you about it, so are there any DDR type games that are easy to install and are good replacements?
[08:02] <graeme> crimsun: so what am I supposed to do then ?
[08:02] <crimsun> c0re^: you're free to compile your own 2.6.19-rc
[08:02] <graeme> pray ?
[08:02] <wraithsoul> I really do not want to have to compile from source.
[08:02] <Vich> wow
[08:02] <Vich> just wow
[08:02] <c0re^> crimsun: thats the thing, i cant get linux on my system
[08:02] <Vich> beryl is crazy
[08:03] <AdamKili> help i'm following instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-6c942d1939d97331f96e42b63774003fde7daed5 i run the first command, it tries to connect, then times out. can anyone help? also the Canonical repository doesn't work when following those instructions
[08:03] <Rookie-> to see what fps is with glxgears - whats the option on that ?
[08:03] <crimsun> graeme: alsaconf isn't going to help you fix your mixer levels. Try using aumix, which uses the much simplified oss api.
[08:03] <unikuser> does any one know evolution mail client has "Mark Thread as Read" option in edgy?
[08:03] <c0re^> crimsun: thats why i need a linux installer that runs 2.6.18+ so my hardware is detected
[08:03] <Alex_Palex> re all
[08:03] <graeme> crimsun: I don't care about my mix levels. I just want sound to work ...
[08:03] <graeme> crimsun: flash sound off the internet won't work either ...
[08:04] <crimsun> graeme: your issue is a mixer level, and I'm on the phone so I can't concentrate on your issue atm
[08:04] <villr[] ye>  anyone here use a web interface to log on to a wireless network?
[08:04] <wraithsoul> no
[08:04] <james_> damn, i'm tired
[08:04] <james_> screw beryl/emerald/xgl for now
[08:04] <c0re^> whaaat, its easy to install
[08:04] <sysdoc> lol
[08:04] <james_> oh, not for me
[08:04] <c0re^> well, get sabayonlinux
[08:04] <james_> no matter what I do, i crash X
[08:05] <graeme> crimsun: k thanks anyway ...
[08:05] <c0re^> it comes preinstalled.
[08:05] <graeme> Can someone help me fix my sound on dapper ?
[08:05] <eck> or fedora core 6 ;-)
[08:05] <james_> or, i get missing window decorations, and THEN I crash X
[08:05] <sysdoc> james_, when does X crach?
[08:05] <c0re^> yeh or fc6
[08:05] <sysdoc> crash*
[08:05] <chapium> AdamKili: look for gstreamer extra plugins under add/remove programs, it might help
[08:05] <crimsun> graeme: ask me again in 20 minutes
[08:05] <AdamKili> chapium: will do
[08:05] <AsheD> why can't I save any changes to /etc/sudoers ?
[08:06] <james_> when I try to disable beryl after starting it, or if I restart it after enabling beryl
[08:06] <eck> AsheD: you need to edit the file using visudo
[08:06] <Mantice> Has beryl been removed from the repositys ?
[08:06] <abes> Any idea on how to change which volume is controlled by the volume function keys?
[08:06] <oht> is 32 bit color not possible with X? or was it just not detected correctly?
[08:06] <chapium> AdamKili: a less graceful approach is described somewhere on this page: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html
[08:07] <_zardoz_> on ubuntu 6.10 my screen goes black and displays no signal after trying to boot live desktop. same thing happens in normal and safe mode. any pointers on how to fix that?
[08:08] <eck> _zardoz_: on the install cd? the use alternate installer
[08:08] <aditsu> hi, how do I tell ubuntu to set the clock to the local time instead of utc?
[08:08] <kvonb> hello, can anyone tell me how to re-install DRI from a term please?  thanks :)
[08:09] <compwiz18> hello
[08:09] <compwiz18> can anyone tell me how i can connect to a wifi network with a hidden essid?
[08:09] <_zardoz_> yes install cd. I'm not sure how to use alternate installer
[08:09] <Vich> well
[08:09] <Vich> I feel a great sense of accomplishment
[08:09] <Vich> ubuntu now looks uber sexy
[08:09] <Vich> and has awesome fading, wobbling effects
[08:10] <eck> _zardoz_: you download the alternate install iso, and then the cd will install using text mode instead of graphical mode
[08:10] <james_> Damn you vich
[08:10] <sysdoc> lol
[08:10] <Vich> reminds me of mac osx
[08:10] <james_> mine never wants to work
[08:10] <Vich> HAHA
[08:10] <Vich> win
[08:10] <Vich> LOL
[08:10] <compwiz18> no one knows how to connect to a hidden essid?
[08:10] <Vich> THIS IS AWESOME
[08:10] <Vich> I expanded a window
[08:10] <eck> compwiz18: enter the essid manually?
[08:10] <Vich> and it looked like it got thrown to the screen
[08:10] <Vich> all bouncy
[08:10] <compwiz18> eck; how so?
[08:10] <sysdoc> james_, when you start beryl-manager do you get any errors?
[08:11] <eck> compwiz18: you can do it using network manager or iwconfig from the command line
[08:11] <_zardoz_> so there is no way to fix this? is it a known issue?
[08:11] <james_> no screens sometimes
[08:11] <sysdoc> Vich, ctrl+alt+ left or right arrow
[08:12] <eck> _zardoz_: my roommate had the same problem, and he was able to install using the alternate cd
[08:12] <soundmaster80> does anyone have an idea when the 9629 nvidia drivers will be released to the repos
[08:12] <graeme> God, I'm seriously pissed at linux right now ... :-(
[08:13] <AsheD> I broke my /etc/sudoers
[08:13] <graeme> If i'd install windows instead, I'd be out enjoying the sunshine on my weekend off ... grrrrr....
[08:13] <mister_roboto> graeme: why not do it then?
[08:13] <preaction> graeme, but how much enjoyment could you get knowing that half your life will now be spent restarting windows to make it work right?
[08:14] <graeme> yeah, I guess I'm just venting ...
[08:14] <sysdoc> preaction, lol
[08:14] <AsheD> ok, I have a rather serious problem.
[08:14] <eck> preaction: i hope you appreciate the irony
[08:14] <soundmaster80> does anyone have an idea when the 9629 nvidia drivers will be released to the repos
[08:14] <graeme> it's gets frustrating when something as simple as sound won't work though ... :-(
[08:14] <cu83> hey all
[08:15] <preaction> eck, i feel the same as him... xubuntu edgy breaks some very small frustrating things from ubuntu dapper :(
[08:15] <nagesh> graeme, even the popup and other stuffs might have added to you enjoyment
[08:15] <AsheD> I was editing /etc/sudoers to allow my user to exec fusermount w/o password, and I evidently broke something in the file
[08:15] <AsheD> now I can neither edit the file nor use sudo AT ALL
[08:15] <graeme> yeah, yeah, I know ... in the long-term I'm better off ... blah blah :-P
[08:15] <preaction> AsheD, restart, use grub to open the recovery console, and remove the line you fux0red
[08:15] <eck> AsheD: did you use visudo?
[08:15] <soundmaster80> ashed, can you boot the desktop cd and fix it from CD?
[08:17] <cu83> can someone help me out, i've installed php4 on my box, but it doesn't see to be working
[08:17] <cu83> i'll open up http://localhost/test.php
[08:17] <preaction> cu83, when in doubt, blame PHP
[08:17] <cu83> hehe  =P
[08:17] <nagesh> cu83, do you have apache installed?
[08:17] <cu83> yep
[08:18] <preaction> cu83, what do you see when you open that up?
[08:18] <graeme> cu83: dude what's "doesn't seem to be working" supposed to mean ?
[08:18] <preaction> !doesn't work
[08:18] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[08:18] <zdravko> Hi there!
[08:18] <JOhNyBoY> hello
[08:18] <cu83> "open up with the default application(gedit)"
[08:19] <cu83> graeme, like it doesn't run it
[08:19] <graeme> cu83: have you set apache to handle .php files ?
[08:19] <cu83> how do i do that?
[08:19] <cu83> =] 
[08:19] <chapium> bah
[08:19] <Orborde> Question about backups: So I'm trying to figure out how to make a decent backup of an entire multibooting system. rdiff-backup seems to be the logical choice for the currently running OS, but what about the other partitions?
[08:19] <graeme> cu83: you go to #apache ....
[08:19] <abes> Who knows how to change the functions of Fn+Something keys?
[08:19] <chapium> anyone know what day sunday is in crontabese
[08:19] <chapium> is it 0?
[08:19] <eck> cu83: when you run 'php' from the command line it doesn't work?
[08:19] <cu83> yep
[08:20] <cu83> eck, yep
[08:20] <eck> what happens?
[08:20] <Orborde> I was thinking that I could run rdiff-backup on the other, unmounted partitions themselves via their /dev/ block file entries.
[08:20] <graeme> eck: that's probably because he doesn't have php installed for cli ...
[08:20] <cu83> it just idles like it wants input, like running the perl command
[08:20] <eck> cu83: then it works
[08:21] <eck> it is just reading from standard in
[08:21] <graeme> cu83: go to #php or #apache. You have to configure apache to run .php files through the php interpreter ...
[08:21] <cu83> graeme, k thanks =] 
[08:21] <graeme> Can anyone help me with a sound issue ?
[08:21] <james_> what the hell
[08:22] <eck> graeme: what is the problem?
[08:22] <nagesh> graeme, what is the problem?
[08:22] <james_> i'm trying to install a screensaver... ./configure, and them make......... but it says "make" doesnt exist
[08:22] <graeme> eck: I don't get any sound ... not from flash, not from videolan ... nothing
[08:22] <preaction> james_, apt-get install build-essential
[08:22] <nagesh> james_, apt-get install make
[08:22] <eck> graeme: is the soundcard recognized?
[08:23] <crimsun> yes, it is recognised.
[08:23] <crimsun> graeme: did you install aumix and use it as I suggested?
[08:23] <graeme> eck: think so yes, asoundconf gives me back CM... something or other ...
[08:23] <graeme> graeme@ubuntu:~$ asoundconf list
[08:23] <graeme> Names of available sound cards: CMI8738
[08:24] <james_> ty
[08:24] <nagesh> graeme, have you installed sound codecs and decodecs?
[08:24] <eetfunk> how do i get the gid and uid of a user from the command line?
[08:24] <crimsun> it's not a codec issue; it's a mixer issue.
[08:24] <mabreaux> I just purchased a Palm tx and would like to know how hard it will be to sync with ubuntu.
[08:24] <Rookie-> eetfunk, id
[08:24] <nagesh> eetfunk, id username
[08:25] <eetfunk> Rookie-: couldnt be easier thanks :)
[08:25] <graeme> nagesh: I figured that vlc would bring all the codecs with it no ?
[08:25] <eetfunk> nagesh:  thnx1
[08:25] <graeme> crimsun: how can you tell that ?
[08:25] <crimsun> graeme: because I handle alsa for ubuntu.
[08:25] <nagesh> graeme, not really .....u have to install gstreamers
[08:25] <graeme> crimsun: ahh .... teach me MASTER ... :-)
[08:26] <chapium> mabreaux: download gnome-pilot and find out :D (I doubt you'll find hlep for something that specific here)
[08:26] <crimsun> graeme: did you check w/ aplay that nothing is audible?
[08:26] <graeme> nagesh: I have streamtuner and xmms ... ( if that's any indication )
[08:26] <crimsun> graeme: e.g., aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav
[08:26] <unikuser> greame:  speaker-test
[08:28] <graeme> crimsun: yeah, tried it. The speakers should go into the green plug right :-P
[08:28] <graeme> ?
[08:29] <crimsun> graeme: remember I don't know the physical layout of your particular hardware, only the driver-level specifics
[08:29] <unikuser> yes it shuold go in green
[08:29] <crimsun> e.g., take a digital photo of the connectors
[08:29] <james_> my USB sound card is working pretty well, better than it does in XP
[08:30] <graeme> crimsun: yeah, the aplay sound isn't working either ...
[08:30] <crimsun> graeme: does it hang, or does it complete with no audible sound?
[08:30] <nagesh> graeme, sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-esd
[08:30] <graeme> crimsun: completes with no audible sound
[08:31] <unikuser> crimsun: is ur sound card mute?
[08:31] <crimsun> graeme: did you pastebin your codec dump? (contents of /proc/asound/card0/codec*/* )
[08:31] <crimsun> unikuser: misdirected
[08:31] <graeme> crimsun: no such file :-(
[08:31] <crimsun> graeme: what about /proc/asound/card0/codec* ?
[08:31] <inc-inc> i have a feeling that my xorg config is not displaying 24 bit colour (i get streaking/"petrol stains" in my images, expecially visible on gradients). Is there a way of checking what colour depth i have?
[08:32] <crimsun> inc-inc: xdpyinfo|grep depths
[08:32] <crimsun> inc-inc: the one listed before the first comma is your current depth
[08:33] <inc-inc> thanks
[08:33] <graeme> crimsun; this is the contents of the card0 dir ...
[08:33] <graeme> cmipci  id  midi0  oss_mixer  pcm0c  pcm0p  pcm1p  pcm2c  pcm2p
[08:33] <inc-inc> it says 24... but maybe ill try 32
[08:33] <james_> I am glad I finally got sound working, I can listen to my music library on one of my windows partitions
[08:33] <crimsun> graeme: is cmipci a directory or a file?
[08:33] <inc-inc> james_: sorry to join the pary late, but are u using an ntfs drive?
[08:34] <inc-inc> *party
[08:34] <james_> the music is on NTFS
[08:34] <graeme> crimsun: regular empty file
[08:34] <crimsun> graeme: pastebin its contents
[08:34] <jazzrocker> what  should i read to learn how to create a package?
[08:34] <jazzrocker> e.g. a .deb
[08:34] <inc-inc> james_: are u using ntfs-3g
[08:34] <graeme> crimsun: it's empty
[08:34] <crimsun> jazzrocker: System> Help> System Documentation> Packaging Guide
[08:34] <james_> i have no idea
[08:34] <inc-inc> have u got it working?
[08:34] <graeme> crimsun: oh wait sorry
[08:34] <crimsun> graeme: it's located on a pseudofilesystem, it will appear via ls to be empty, but it's not.
[08:35] <james_> I've been up for 17 hours, I need to go to bed
[08:35] <james_> I believe I'll be joining this channel more often
[08:35] <graeme> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/246490
[08:35] <james_> you guys are actually helpful
[08:36] <james_> thanks a lot, and have a good night
[08:36] <crimsun> graeme: thanks, now I need ``lspci -nv''
[08:37] <graeme> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/246491 ... thanks :-)
[08:38] <eternalswd> I just upgraded to edgy from dapper, and anything running gksudo is getting "unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file", what might I do to fix this?
[08:38] <unikuser> greame: what does running alsamixer do?
[08:39] <inc-inc> crimsun: in the output of xdpyinfo, there are a whole bunch of "visual:" sections. All say significant bits in color specification:  8 bits. Is that incorrect?
[08:39] <graeme> unikuser: opens the alsamixer in terminal ...
[08:39] <[SUDO] Tux> jordan_u?
[08:39] <[SUDO] Tux> Jordan_U?
[08:39] <unikuser> greame: with master, pcm and all?
[08:39] <crimsun> inc-inc: use what I told you
[08:40] <unikuser> and with ur sound card name?
[08:40] <inc-inc> crimsun: can u tell me what the out put of "xdpyinfo|grep significant" is
[08:40] <crimsun> inc-inc: it's not relevant, but it's 8 bits
[08:40] <inc-inc> thx
[08:40] <inc-inc> just wanted to make sure
[08:42] <crimsun> graeme: (sec, I'm crossreferencing the code)
[08:45] <crimsun> graeme: have you created an asoundrc?
[08:45] <graeme> crimsun: nope. I figured there'd be one in there already ?
[08:45] <crimsun> graeme: not by default.
[08:45] <graeme> just a runscript for sound right ?
[08:45] <graeme> or maybe I'm misunderstanding ...
[08:46] <paragonc> how do i find out what type of integrated video card a box is running?
[08:46] <crimsun> graeme: don't worry about it now.
[08:46] <crimsun> graeme: amixer set 'Four Channel Mode' off
[08:46] <crimsun> graeme: warning, turn down your speakers/headphones first
[08:47] <eck> paragonc: look for something relevant in lspci
[08:47] <paragonc> eck - 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. UniChrome Pro IGP (rev 01)
[08:48] <paragonc> would that be it?
[08:48] <eck> that sounds like it
[08:48] <graeme> crimsun: it's still as dead as a doornail ... :-(
[08:48] <paragonc> diagnosing a xorg problem from 550 miles away :D
[08:48] <wheelswitch> i want to back up my home folder as i am about to do an ubuntu reinstall
[08:49] <crimsun> graeme: ok, amixer set 'Exchange DAC' off
[08:49] <wheelswitch> sudo cp /home/myusername/ /myusbdisk/ doesnt seem to be working, what is the easiest way?
[08:49] <graeme> crimsun: yip
[08:49] <ClayG> anyone know of a xdmcp/rdp live cd?
[08:49] <eternalswd> wheelswitch, are you trying to copy a directory?
[08:49] <eck> wheelswitch: cp -a
[08:49] <Sohan> Salut
[08:49] <Tokenbad> well this sucks...tried to mount a iso and says something about requires an operating system that supports the ISO-13346 "UDF" file system specification.
[08:49] <eck> or tar it up
[08:49] <crimsun> graeme: "yip"?
[08:50] <zdravko> i want to ask something...
[08:50] <zdravko> about Feisty
[08:50] <zdravko> and Dapper
[08:50] <zdravko> ad Edgy :)
[08:50] <zdravko> Dapper is LTS?
[08:51] <crimsun> zdravko: yes
[08:51] <wheelswitch> eck:  thankyou sir
[08:51] <zdravko> Edgy and Festy - no LTS?
[08:51] <crimsun> zdravko: correct
[08:51] <zdravko> then we should stay by Dapper?
[08:51] <crimsun> zdravko: depends on your needs
[08:51] <zdravko> for the next 2 years?
[08:51] <graeme> crimsun: sorry. Yes, I've turned the DAC Exchange off but still no sound
[08:51] <zdravko> i don't know my needs
[08:51] <zdravko> but I prefer mastered works
[08:52] <zdravko> now I use Edgy
[08:52] <zdravko> but I feel like Dapper was better
[08:52] <zdravko> maybe even Feisty won't satisfy me
[08:52] <zdravko> Dapper was a stable version
[08:52] <crimsun> graeme: and you're outputting to analog speakers, not a digital receiver, correct?
[08:52] <Staz> Does anybody know of a good page that contains the ubuntu boot arguments, and what they do. eg splash and quiet.
[08:53] <Tokenbad> can ubuntu handle a iso that uses iso-13346 udf file system? I want to mount the iso..
[08:53] <crimsun> zdravko: we spend considerable effort on Dapper on support it for 3 years on the desktop
[08:53] <graeme> crimsun: I have a headphone plugged in ... yes
[08:53] <zdravko> cool
[08:53] <crimsun> zdravko: to support, rather
[08:53] <zdravko> Dapper was released June 2006?
[08:53] <crimsun> zdravko: yes
[08:53] <zdravko> this means I can use it till June2009
[08:54] <crimsun> graeme: how many output jacks are there?
[08:54] <graeme> crimsun: output jacks ? blue pink green ...
[08:54] <ivx> hello when ever i right click my clock and select adjust date and time, the clock crashes, i rebooted and still crashed, anyone know what the deal?
[08:54] <crimsun> graeme: you have _3_?!
[08:55] <graeme> crimsun: OK it's working dude :-)
[08:55] <graeme> You're my GOD :-)
[08:55] <crimsun> heh.
[08:55] <graeme> the sound card won't work, but the onboard sound will work ...
[08:55] <eternalswd> I'm having a problem with gksudo.  sudo works.  when I try gksudo it gives my this error in the terminal: Error copying '/home/myusername/.Xauthority' to '/tmp/libgksu-sZhYXt': Permission denied
[08:55] <graeme> what was wrong do you think ?
[08:56] <crimsun> which onboard sound chipset is it?
[08:56] <eternalswd> the gksudo problem only started after upgrading from dapper to edgy
[08:56] <graeme> crimsun: 0000:00:0d.0 Multimedia audio controller: C-Media Electronics Inc CM8738 (rev 10) ... ??
[08:57] <unikuser> eternalswd: try removing those 2 files and restart x
[08:57] <crimsun> that _is_ your sound card, then
[08:57] <dreffy> hello, hello!Problems galore. I can can surf the net, ping addresses in www.hotmail.com but not ping 202.27.158.40, i cant get any repository updates either. what's up???
[08:57] <ivx> hello when ever i right click my clock and select adjust date and time, the clock crashes, i rebooted and still crashed, anyone know what the deal?
[08:57] <zdravko> i can't imagine myself using Dapper until June 2009!
[08:57] <crimsun> graeme: how is sound working? did you switch jacks?
[08:58] <dreffy> actually my xchat wasnt working either im using a web irc client
[08:58] <graeme> crimsun: yeah, I switched between the soundcard and the onboard sound. But I'd done that before I made your changes and it didnt work back then ...
[08:58] <Shadowpillar_> one design flaw in ubuntu I hate is the mandatory need for certain apps
[08:58] <eck> zdravko: you can always use dapper, skip a few releases, and then upgrade to something you like before then
[08:58] <unikuser> dreffy: even i cannot ping ip u gave me
[08:58] <zdravko> aha, I see
[08:58] <Shadowpillar_> try to uninstall totem? it'll try to uninstall gnome
[08:58] <zdravko> thanks for the information
[08:58] <crimsun> graeme: err, you only have one pci sound chipset listed in lspci -nv
[08:58] <Shadowpillar_> or ubuntu-desktop
[08:58] <crimsun> graeme: what's the output from ``asoundconf list''
[08:59] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: ubuntu-desktop is a meta package, it's safe to uninstall
[08:59] <eternalswd> unikuser, wouldn't removing my Xauthority file be problematic?  I guess I can just make a backup in case something goes wrong
[08:59] <Shadowpillar_> Flannel: sucks to upgrade without, though
[08:59] <graeme> crimsun: Names of available sound cards:
[08:59] <graeme> CMI8738
[08:59] <Shadowpillar_> tbh, I won't be putting edgy on my main box
[08:59] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: thats why update-manager sticks it back in
[08:59] <Shadowpillar_> it isnt much of a new upgrade
[08:59] <ivx> or if someone could tell me what 4am in pst would equal in mountain time i would be good
[08:59] <crimsun> graeme: ok, what did you do to "get sound," then?
[09:00] <crimsun> ivx: one hour earlier
[09:00] <unikuser>  eternalswd: that file is generated everytime x starts
[09:00] <Shadowpillar_> and dapper will be supported for a long time
[09:00] <dreffy> unikuser, that address may be wrong but i still cant get any connections to the repository
[09:00] <Flannel> eternalswd: it shouldn't be too problematic.  And, next time use gksudo instead of sudo for graphical apps
[09:00] <crimsun> ivx: sorry, later
[09:00] <graeme> crimsun: just switched to the onboard sound ...
[09:00] <atrus> shouldn't meta-packages like that suggest/recommend the packages they're associated with? that way the software gets installed by default, but you can safely and easilly ignore the dependancies if you really want to?
[09:00] <Flannel> crimsun: 5am mountain time is 4am pst
[09:00] <crimsun> graeme: how did you do that? Did you physically switch jacks?
[09:00] <graeme> crimsun: pci also has a ...
[09:00] <unikuser> dreffy: what does ping archive.ubuntu.com do?
[09:00] <graeme> 0000:00:0d.1 Communication controller: C-Media Electronics Inc CM8738 (rev 10)
[09:00] <crimsun> Flannel: see above.
[09:00] <graeme> crimsun: yes
[09:00] <unikuser> dreffy: using any firewall?
[09:00] <Flannel> crimsun: one hour later. not earlier.
[09:00] <Shadow_mil> Hey check out this sweet new background!   http://71.28.76.149/sweet.png.gz
[09:00] <ryanpg> so I installed some stuff from source, now I can't install a package I want because it provides files from a home made deb, isn't there an apt-get redirect or something?
[09:00] <eternalswd> Flannel, yeah that's why I want to get it working
[09:00] <ivx> crimsun i like one hour earlier, but thanks i got it.
[09:01] <crimsun> Flannel: note my correction.
[09:01] <dreffy> response from archive.ubuntu.com - no firewall
[09:01] <crimsun> graeme: you only have one sound card.
[09:01] <dreffy> ethernet connection dhcp
[09:01] <crimsun> graeme: (that alsa recognizes)
[09:01] <Shadowpillar_> Flannel: openoffice is quite useless to me, because abiword is a better word processor than OO writer, and I never use OO, if I were to uninstall it, I'd break my system :(
[09:01] <graeme> crimsun: so the CM... is the onboard card then ?
[09:01] <ryanpg> "apt-get move" or something... it places the files installed somewhere else while installing the conflicting package?
[09:01] <crimsun> graeme: correct.
[09:02] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: So, don't use ubuntu, use xubuntu, I believe it uses abiword by default
[09:02] <dreffy> unikuser, i got a response from ubuntu archive, i got no firewall
[09:02] <graeme> crimsun: i guss that explains it then. Although I did test it with the onboard also ...
[09:02] <Shadow_mil> People downloading it, tell me what you think of it
[09:02] <Shadow_mil> once your done
[09:02] <unikuser> try installing package and see
[09:02] <Shadowpillar_> Flannel: my point is, someone shouldnt have to use a whole different configuration to cut away the bloat
[09:02] <Flannel> atrus: the point of meta packages isn't to "get a full desktop", it's really to make requirements  lot easier, for instance, if I needed a program that compiled stuff, I could simply depend on "build-essential" and be assured that everything I needed would be there
[09:03] <crimsun> graeme: you don't have two distinct cards recognised by alsa, which is what I've been saying.
[09:03] <graeme> crimsun: OK cool thanks. Is there anyway to know from lspci whether the card is onboard or off ?
[09:03] <Tokenbad> can ubuntu handle a iso that uses iso-13346 udf file system? I want to mount the iso but it uses 13346
[09:03] <graeme> crimsun: maybe it's in dmesg ?
[09:04] <crimsun> graeme: it's _the_ sound card
[09:04] <unikuser> Tokenbad: pastebin exact message u got when u tried mounting.
[09:04] <jokoon> Hello ! my Gaim just seems to crash and close by himself when log in on my MSN account, (I'm running dapper drake and it is the default ubuntu gaim). I heard about Gajim, but is there any other way to fix that ? Would it be some character one of buddies put in his nickname ?
[09:05] <Shadowpillar_> Flannel: if ubuntu wants to be an alternative to non-free operating systems, it shouldnt try to control what the user can do
[09:05] <graeme> crimsun: thanks dude :-)
[09:05] <crimsun> graeme: np
[09:05] <Tokenbad> unikuser, it didn't give a msg when mounted...it put a readme.txt in the dir I mounted to saying that requires an operating system that supports the ISO-13346 "UDF" file system
[09:05] <Shadowpillar_> nothing should rely on a certain package or delete it
[09:06] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: It's hardly forcing you to keep the "ubuntu-desktop" meta package still around, or even to use it to begin with
[09:06] <unikuser> Tokenbad:what is the command u tried?
[09:06] <|rt|> jokoon: i believe that's due to a change in MSN protocal...the newer releases of GAIM correct the problem
[09:06] <Shadowpillar_> Flannel: I remember a while ago removing it was a very bad thing
[09:06] <Shadowpillar_> but that was with hoary
[09:06] <Shadowpillar_> er
[09:06] <Shadowpillar_> warty
[09:06] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: Removing ubuntu-desktop has NEVER been a bad thing, except with upgrades.  Even in warty.
[09:07] <jokoon> |rt| : thank you. some I just have to apt-get update gaim ?
[09:07] <Flannel> Shadowpillar_: And, if you want something that doesn't have certain stuff require oher certain stuff, what you want is a distro without package management.
[09:07] <jokoon> -me
[09:07] <Tokenbad> unikuser, the normal mount command...sudo mount file.iso /media/cdemu/ -t iso9660 -o loop
[09:07] <|rt|> jokoon: I don't think the versions that correct the problem are in the dapper repositories
[09:07] <jokoon> Ok
[09:08] <unikuser> hmm strange
[09:08] <|rt|> jokoon: so you would either need to find a repository or deb file for the newest version or upgrade to edgy
[09:08] <dreffy> doing a sudo apt-get update i get [1.0.0.0]  101 network is unreachable
[09:08] <Tokenbad> unikuser, I did try iso13346 also...says unknown format
[09:08] <jokoon> |rt| : Can I upgrade to edgy while I'm with drake ?
[09:09] <|rt|> jokoon: check the urls in the topic for upgrading
[09:11] <paragonc> how do i enable  Universe and Multiverse repositories.
[09:11] <unikuser> Tokenbad: try -t udf
[09:12] <Flannel> !multiverse | paragonc
[09:12] <ubotu> paragonc: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[09:12] <atrus> Flannel: yeah, i don't buy that. if build-essential is a meta-package, you don't need it. you need the things it depends on. it's trivial to copy the dependancies of it out and depend on those if you really need to. besides that, you don't get any guarantee that the things you use in your package will be in build-essential later on.
[09:12] <paragonc> the guide for 6.06 doesnt seem applicable for 6.1
[09:12] <Mitz> Flannel: yeah, I don't buy that.
[09:12] <Tokenbad> unikuser, may I ask where you found that...I was looking on inet for info...
[09:12] <Tokenbad> and it worked
[09:12] <unikuser> man mount, is that working?
[09:13] <Mitz> Tokenbad: awesome
[09:13] <Flannel> atrus: yes, you are guarenteed, it's a social contract.
[09:13] <Mitz> atrus: yeah, you're guarenteed
[09:14] <atrus> wow
[09:14] <jokoon> What is the different between a penguin ?
[09:14] <atrus> ok, i stand corrected, but, eww. :)
[09:14] <atrus> jokoon: one of its legs are both the same.
[09:14] <jokoon> Yeaah right atrus !
[09:16] <Flannel> paragonc: they should be close enough.  Just software properties, and enable universe, then edit it to also include multiverse.  Or, the easy (as in, I knowwhat Im doing and don't wantto figure out which buttons I need to press to get there) is just edit your sources.list, which is identical in both thse versions.  And, for the record it's 6.10 (six dot ten) (year month) not 6.1
[09:17] <paragonc> Flannel - do i replace dapper with edgy ?
[09:17] <splintax> ok
[09:17] <splintax> i just did something very stupid
[09:17] <splintax> sudo rm -r /usr/local/lib
[09:17] <splintax> any idea how i can fix it?
[09:17] <splintax> folders that were in there: perl and python2.4
[09:17] <paragonc>  sources.list is what im looking at - but i guess i dont know which animal to put for 6.1 :D
[09:18] <roryy> heh
[09:18] <roryy> paragonc: be sure to read the upgrade notes as well, especially if you're going to use apt-get/aptitude and not update-manager
[09:20] <paragonc> im new to ubuntu
[09:20] <paragonc> well
[09:20] <paragonc> im helping someone new to linux get ubuntu running
[09:20] <Thunderpants> im about to buy a wireless card for my laptop, does anybody have experience of getting a belkin 7010/7011 or a netgear WG511T working under ubuntu?
[09:20] <paragonc> i've been dealing with slackware and gentoo for 3 or 4 years and BSD before that
[09:20] <paragonc> this is just foreign land to me :D
[09:21] <holycow> no worries
[09:21] <holycow> just ask
[09:21] <holycow> and welcome
[09:21] <oht> when trying to play a(ny) video in mplayer: "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device.
[09:21] <oht> any ideas?
[09:22] <Flannel> paragonc: yeah, it'll all be edgy
[09:22] <holycow> oht, select properties and try a different video codec
[09:22] <Handsome_Devil> has anybody ever setup dial up before?
[09:22] <splintax> i just did something very stupid; "sudo rm -r /usr/local/lib". any idea how i can fix it?  folders that were in there: perl and python2.4
[09:22] <Flannel> paragonc: really, it's just uncommenting the lines in your current sources.list, and then adding "multiverse" after "universe"
[09:22] <paragonc> ya im reading that now
[09:22] <paragonc> :D
[09:22] <oht> ah, ok, i can right click on the video screen for a menu...hehe :P
[09:22] <crimsun> splintax: did you install any local perl or python2.4 source?
[09:23] <SurfnKid> whats a good mpg/avi/wmv recorder for linux?
[09:23] <paragonc> what about deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy-security universe multiverse
[09:23] <crimsun> splintax: (e.g., perl/python2.4 modules/apps)
[09:23] <Mitz> splintax: did you install any local perl or python source?
[09:23] <splintax> crimsun: no python, maybe some perl stuff
[09:23] <splintax> Mitz: see above
[09:23] <paragonc> and deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy-updates universe multiverse
[09:23] <holycow> splintax, lol! damn that brings back memories
[09:23] <crimsun> splintax: did you compile it yourself? you don't remember?
[09:23] <Flannel> paragonc: what about them?
[09:23] <Thunderpants> im about to buy a wireless network card, am i better off with belkin of netgear?
[09:23] <oht> holycow: i'm using the nvidia proprietary drivers, which video driver should i use?
[09:23] <paragonc> uncomment all 4?
[09:23] <splintax> crimsun: i've been using ubuntu for about a week. no, i don't remember
[09:23] <crimsun> splintax: if you didn't compile anything yourself, then you have nothing to worry about
[09:24] <Flannel> paragonc: sure
[09:24] <holycow> splintax, you have just passed a milestone in your linux use ... hehe :) we all do that
[09:24] <splintax> holycow: yep, after a week :P
[09:24] <bthornton> Right now my monitor is running at 85 Hz refresh but I know it can do up to 120 Hz in this resolution, which means I need a modeline.  There's a program that auto-detects and generates modelines but I don't recall what it is--anybody know?
[09:24] <crimsun> splintax: (any perl/python2.4 packages installed via a package manager installs into /usr, not /usr/local)
[09:24] <Flannel> Thunderpants: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport  there's a wireless network cards section
[09:24] <oht> bthornton: it's actually a website, googling "linux xorg.conf modeline generator" will probably get you to it
[09:24] <holycow> splintax, not codec i mean drivers under the video tab ... try one of the ones you see in that list
[09:24] <splintax> holycow: i think it's kind of stupid really. linux is meant to be more "secure" because you don't run as root.. but pretty much every install needs to be run through sudo.. so you inevitably make a mistake like this. and since i made it on the terminal, it's not in garbage
[09:25] <Mitz> holycow: I think it's kinda stupid
[09:25] <splintax> holycow: what? :S
[09:25] <youser> hey whats the newest most reliable version of amsn i could have right now?
[09:25] <holycow> splintax, actually its not stupid, your not compreheding the 5w's of the situation
[09:25] <splintax> crimsun: all i can remember is installing VMware which was done via a perl script. said script compiled stuff
[09:25] <splintax> holycow: enlighten me?
[09:25] <crimsun> splintax: then you have nothing to worry over
[09:25] <BHSPitLappy_> Rookie-, that issue got resolved by the way-  a real forehead slapper
[09:25] <splintax> crimsun: but it shouldn't have compiled any perl code then
[09:25] <holycow> splintax, the general rule of thumb is linux gives you A LOT OF POWER.  what that generally means is people shoot them selves in the foot A LOT
[09:25] <Mitz> crimsun: but it shouldn't have compiled any perl code
[09:26] <splintax> crimsun: so /usr/local is what?
[09:26] <Thunderpants> the Flannel
[09:26] <splintax> crimsun: where compiled code goes or what?
[09:26] <Thunderpants> thx Flannel i meant
[09:26] <crimsun> splintax: reserved for admin-specific (manual) installations.
[09:26] <crimsun> splintax: by default packages use the /usr prefix, not /usr/local
[09:26] <Mitz> ^
[09:27] <splintax> crimsun: i see. so installation of perl/python made those directories? it's kind of worrying that they were there, even though i now know that they were probably empty.
[09:27] <Rookie-> BHSPitLappy, how and what was wrong ?
[09:27] <Boglizk> Where did Firefox 2.0 install itself?
[09:27] <crimsun> splintax: they're created for convenience, yes.
[09:28] <splintax> crimsun: i was following a tutorial on installing the last.fm player. told me to put the files extracted from the .tar.gz in that folder. any particular reason for that?
[09:28] <Boglizk> i doubt it, i'm sure you can put them anywhere...
[09:28] <splintax> Boglizk: /usr/lib i think? either way you should be able to run "firefox" on the terminal.
[09:29] <Boglizk> splintax: Yeah, funny thing... firefox 1.5.2 pops up
[09:29] <crimsun> splintax: that seems silly. It's preferable to compile things as an unprivileged user and to only install to system-wide locations upon pain of death
[09:29] <dreffy> hey my resolv.conf has nameserver 10.1.1.1, im having problems connecting to repos, what should this be?
[09:29] <chris___1> does anyone know why my gtk theme isn't affecting application like epiphany
[09:29] <splintax> crimsun: so dodgy tutorial then. well thanks for your help
[09:30] <chris___1> the gtk icons are only matching my theme on the desktop
[09:30] <splintax> Boglizk: can you actually open ff 1.5.2? maybe it installed into the old dir or something?
[09:30] <chris___1> but not on applications
[09:30] <dreffy> someone plz post post abck whats in your /etc/resolv.conf
[09:30] <Boglizk> splintax: It works with ./firefox in usr/lib
[09:30] <roryy> dreffy: you need to find that out from your ISP; my understanding is that usually resolv.conf is automatically setup by bootp or during ppp initialization, or whatever
[09:30] <Boglizk> I seem to have another copy of firefox which "hijacks" the link...
[09:31] <roryy> dreffy: how are you connected to the internet?
[09:31] <youser> amsn anyone?
[09:31] <dreffy> roryy, is it your isp dns servers, or what?
[09:31] <_zardoz_> should I set bootable flag on my root partition?
[09:31] <lazzareth> Im looking for a new torrent client, the stock python bittorrent doesn't support queuing and Azureus is using 100% nonstop
[09:31] <lazzareth> 100% cpu that is
[09:31] <dreffy> rorry, its strange my internet works but not sudo get-update or irc
[09:31] <Boglizk> lazzareth: Use Torrent through Wine
[09:31] <roryy> dreffy: that's a good option, but it could be something else, e.g., your ADSL router
[09:32] <roryy> dreffy: so you can use firefox?
[09:32] <dreffy> i got a dlink broadband modem
[09:32] <dreffy> rorry, i use firefox, works ok, had to disable ipv6
[09:32] <lazzareth> Boglizk I tried that, uTorrent was giving me an error because it 'could not open the ports on the windows firewall' or something of the like
[09:33] <dreffy> rorry,im on this cchannel in a browser irc client
[09:33] <roryy> dreffy: it didn't work at all if you didn't disable ipv6 ?
[09:33] <Boglizk> You could disable that setting, it has never been any problems with it for me :] 
[09:33] <lazzareth> And that it couldnt forward the nat ports ( which by the way i forwarded manually )
[09:33] <Bommel800> good morning :)
[09:33] <dreffy> rorry, no didnt work prior ro disabling ipv6
[09:33] <lazzareth> But i will try again, Seeing as im running out of options for clients with Transport Encryption
[09:33] <roryy> dreffy: what happens if you run 'dig www.google.com' on the command line?
[09:34] <adrenaline> Hey smb4k will only browse lan if I run as root anybody else run into this?
[09:34] <adrenaline> sudo smb4k
[09:34] <adrenaline> if I run as user app opens but no browsing
[09:34] <dreffy> rorry, i got a reply but i dont know what to look for in it
[09:35] <adrenaline> any idea
[09:35] <holycow> smb4k really doesn't work, that package needs to be dropped
[09:35] <holycow> why aren't you just using nautilus?

[09:35] <adrenaline> it works awesome if run as root holycow
[09:35] <dreffy> roryy, i got a reply, but what ami looking for?
[09:35] <roryy> dreffy: do you see (among other things) a line with something like 'a.l.google.com.         28627   IN      A       216.239.53.9'  ?
[09:35] <roryy> dreffy: the precise numbers and addresses aren't important
[09:36] <holycow> adrenaline, sorry to tell you dude, its a piece of crap.  really.
[09:36] <adrenaline> what else works then?
[09:36] <holycow> nautilus
[09:36] <holycow> what do you mean?
[09:36] <adrenaline> It is the only thing I found that browses
[09:36] <dreffy> i got a header section, then question section www.google.com IN  A
[09:36] <holycow> places / network servers
[09:36] <adrenaline> nautilus is not working
[09:36] <holycow> doesn't that work for you?
[09:36] <jokoon> Mh the update manager thing was installing things and I mistakely closed the terminal that started it and it looks like I closed the update manager by doing that ... any idea ?
[09:36] <dreffy> roryy, i got a header section, then question section www.google.com IN  A

[09:39] <adrenaline> holycow seems that it uses smbmnt but smbmnt can only be run by sudo

[09:39] <adrenaline> no
[09:39] <adrenaline> wont open the host
[09:40] <holycow> thats just weird

[09:40] <adrenaline> I know but if I run smb4k as root it works
[09:40] <holycow> do you have any other windows boxes see the shares?
[09:40] <adrenaline> all of them exept ubuntu
[09:40] <holycow> *hmmm*
[09:41] <holycow> weird

[09:41] <adrenaline> If I could run places >network servers as root it would work

[09:41] <adrenaline> ya but I don't want to how do I fix that?
[09:41] <holycow> adrenaline, however you shouldn't be running anything as root
[09:41] <holycow> ever

[09:42] <holycow> adrenaline, sounds like there is something else wrong with you system, there is no reason to run nautilus via gksudo

[09:42] <youser> can anyonehelp me get amsn workig
[09:42] <roryy> dreffy: that looks ok

[09:43] <adrenaline> ok
[09:43] <roryy> dreffy: just tell me if it works, i don't need to see the output
[09:43] <adrenaline> holycow, can you play music across your network in nautilus?
[09:43] <Gonzo> welcome to samba
[09:43] <holycow> adrenaline, you can't
[09:44] <Gonzo> aww...
[09:44] <adrenaline> nope
[09:44] <holycow> smb isn't part of linux like it is in windows
[09:44] <adrenaline> unless I run smb4k as root
[09:44] <roryy> dreffy: the last line will be something say   'index.html' save [2933] 
[09:44] <roryy> saved, even
[09:44] <holycow> apps haveto know about smb to be able to play music files over that protocol
[09:44] <holycow> and most don't really care
[09:44] <adrenaline> holycow, I can in debian
[09:45] <holycow> you ought to probably  run a streaming server
[09:45] <adrenaline> I also can in ubuntu if I run nautilus as root
[09:45] <eck> holycow: not if the smb share is mounted
[09:45] <dreffy> rorry, connecting to 1.0.0.0 :80 - - but dosent seem to be doing anything else, same as my apt-get update, it says connecting to 1.0.0.0 but never moves past that
[09:45] <adrenaline> I don't know how to run a streaming server
[09:45] <BadKitt1> Anyone use gdesklets??
[09:45] <dreffy> roryy, connecting to 1.0.0.0 :80 - - but dosent seem to be doing anything else, same as my apt-get update, it says connecting to 1.0.0.0 but never moves past that
[09:45] <chalcedny> is the dapper shutdown different from breezy? I tried to shutdown to reboot my box, the icons are different, i clicked shutdown but it's hungup somewhere.. what now?
[09:45] <roryy> dreffy: hmm
[09:46] <roryy> dreffy: you say your resolve.conf has 'nameserver 10.1.1.1' ?
[09:46] <holycow> eck, actually thats true lol i forgot , *sigh* its too late
[09:46] <eck> chalcedny: i think you can switch to a vt (vt1?) and see what is going on
[09:46] <adrenaline> ya but I can't mount unless I sudo
[09:47] <chalcedny> eck can you tell me how? my son is asleep.. he usually takes care of it
[09:47] <dreffy> roryy, nameserver 10.1.1.1
[09:47] <feles> hello all
[09:47] <roryy> dreffy: ok, what does 'tracepath -n 10.1.1.1' do ?
[09:48] <tomaszpw> hi all
[09:48] <feles> I had a general question... does any player in linux like playing movies/music over the network?
[09:48] <feles> linux being ubuntu... >.>
[09:48] <tomaszpw> vlc player
[09:48] <feles> really?
[09:48] <adrenaline> fales I am working on that right now
[09:48] <dreffy> roryy, 1:  10.1.1.4          0.456ms pmtu 1500
[09:48] <holycow> feles, actually as eck pointed out ... you haveto mount the shared network drive locally
[09:48] <dreffy>  1:  10.1.1.1          3.064ms reached
[09:48] <dreffy>      Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 1 back 1
[09:48] <feles> hmmm
[09:48] <alecjw> feles: i reccomend vlc too. it can play loads of cool (?) codecs like windoze media and quicktime too
[09:48] <holycow> you can even do it over sshfs
[09:49] <feles> yeah, I know, I have VLC installed already
[09:49] <holycow> and yeah vlc is the best of all the players imho
[09:49] <feles> holycow, how do you mount the drive locally?
[09:49] <roryy> dreffy: OK. So you are connected via a 'normal' network cable (ethernet) to your broadband router/modem ?
[09:49] <alecjw> feles: Places>>Connect to server and then you can mount an ssh thing as a drive
[09:49] <dreffy> roryy, that is right
[09:50] <chalcedny> wow.. ok  i guess it just took a long time to shutdown. (i brought the laptop in here)
[09:50] <holycow> feles, depends on the protocol, generally you create a folder then mount /some/share /on/this/folder
[09:50] <feles> this would be a samba share
[09:50] <roryy> dreffy: that router probably has address 10.1.1.1, and is acting as a proxy for internet address lookups
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[09:51] <roryy> dreffy: either it is doing something wrong, or there's some setup error; anyway, take a look at the router configuration (if you know how). If not, you could try to find out your ISP's nameservers and put those in /etc/resolv.conf instead of 10.1.1.1
[09:52] <dreffy> roryy, by nameserver do you mean dns address, or are they 2 things
[09:52] <roryy> dreffy: a nameserver (or dns server) is a machine that tells you an IP (numerical) address given a 'human-readable' address
[09:53] <dreffy> i ahve the dns addresses from my isp they are 202.27.158.40, but cant ping it - ill have to ring em again to confirm

[10:07] <EdgeT> Guys, How do I configure Grub to automaticaly pop the menu?
[10:07] <ubuGavin> It isn't clear in the GParted documentation that you can't modify the currently booted partition. Long story short, I figured out that you have to "unmount" it first, which is an option, but the command didn't work (because I'm using the partition) and I think it may have changed something, so now I'm afraid to reboot my comp. If the mountpoint were suddenly set to "/" instead of a specific location on the harddrive, would it

[10:08] <EdgeT> Plz
[10:08] <BlueEagle> noodles12: If you're runnign a smb server on  your linux box you may want to reduce the os level or set it not to become local master. Not sure if that is the cause, but smb (smbtree in particular) does some weird caching or something that makes for confusion.

[10:14] <EdgeT> ubuGavin: Well, it should be "/"
[10:15] <Mantice> my Azureus dont minimize to system tray.
[10:15] <variant> ubuGavin: you can't set the mountpoint with gparted..
[10:15] <ubuGavin> EdgeT: OK. Any reason why it might be something different? It was completely different before I ran Gparted, which is why I'm worried that it suddenly changed.
[10:15] <EdgeT> ubuGavin: "/" = root = primary hdd/partition
=== ubunturetek is now known as ubuntubaratretek
[10:15] <EdgeT> ubuGavin: What was it like before?
[10:16] <EdgeT> I guess you could "roll-back"
[10:16] <EdgeT> ?
[10:16] <ubuGavin> EdgeT: Long, so I can't really remember.
[10:16] <variant> ubuGavin: / is the top of your filesystem tree, ubuntu is installed there
[10:16] <variant> ubuGavin: in a terminal type ls /
[10:16] <dreffy> roryy, putting in those dns addresses to /etc/resolv.conf worked btw, but apparently on reboot i'll have to re-enter them as resolv.conf is dynamically created
[10:17] <dreffy> roryy, thanks again
[10:17] <ubuGavin> variant: It's normal.
[10:17] <ubuntubaratretek> hi
[10:17] <variant> dreffy: change teh permissions on /etc/resolv.conf and stop it from being writable
[10:17] <chaoslynx> im trying to upgrade to efty but the upgrade broke because one package couldnt be removed... now i want to remove the package manually... i tried apt-get install -f but it didnt work either... can someone help me?
[10:17] <variant> ubuGavin: what do you mean it's normal?
[10:17] <timephoenix> Is anyone able to help with my font problem? I have a deadline to meet...
[10:17] <variant> chaoslynx: what package?
[10:17] <variant> timephoenix: what font problem?
[10:17] <chaoslynx> its spring-mod-aa
[10:17] <noodles12> BlueEagle: how do i reduce my os level? the only thing i found in the smb.conf file was to change domain master
[10:18] <chaoslynx> some game package
[10:18] <timephoenix> I'm having issues with installing some TTF fonts. I've put them into /usr/share/fonts/truetype/myfonts, ~/.fonts... it appears in Nautilus with fonts:// and all applications but OOo 1.9 (which doesn't have spadmin). Any ideas?
[10:18] <ubuGavin> variant: Lists all of the regular culprits... etc root serv tmp var, etc.
[10:18] <variant> ubuGavin: there there is no problem
[10:18] <variant> ubuGavin: unless you changed /etc/fstab
[10:18] <variant> ubuGavin: to resize your / partition you would have to reboot to the live cd
[10:19] <ubuGavin> variant: Yeah, I figured that at first, but it isn't explicitly stated in the Gparted documentation, so I figured it would be no harm trying.
[10:19] <TheManiacKY> Can someone please tell me what I need to do toget my i810_audio card working in my laptop? Its the only thing not working in Ubuntu. I've done a modprobe i810_audio and I'm just sent back to the prompt with still no sound
[10:19] <Mantice> I keep hearing this ding dong every 30 min any one know what it is.
[10:19] <chaoslynx> it was not from an official repository and i guess thats the problem because the original repository was removed due the upgrade.. maybe its because of that.. it seems to be that theres no file left but it cant be removed
[10:19] <AsheD> yeh, so gnome crashing with 'Uknown Error' is not usually a good thing
[10:20] <ubuGavin> variant: I'll just have to reboot and hope that Gparted was just being silly when it was telling me my hda wasn't booting from root! Thanks anyways man.
[10:21] <variant> TheManiacKY: if it just gives you no reply whenyou modprobe it then the modprobe was successful, you then need to unmute the soundcard with alsamixer (apt-get install alsamixergui)
[10:21] <chaoslynx> variant: is there a way to just delete the package from the list or so ... so that it is ignored...?
[10:21] <variant> chaoslynx: don't know sorry
[10:21] <variant> chaoslynx: please pastebin the full error message

[10:30] <variant> _zardoz_: you will quickly be kicked
[10:30] <ROBOd> saxin: am i wrong?
[10:30] <_zardoz_> kick me fucker, I dare you to kick me

=== |ROP|Gandhi is now known as gandhi
[10:44] <chaoslynx> anyone can tell me how to remove a package from the package list so that it is ignored even if it is broken...i need to remove the package to continue the update to efty.. i knwo it is not an important package and it doesnt have any funtionality so it would be enough to just let the package managers ignore it
[10:45] <hastesaver> chaoslynx, just remove (uninstall) that package?
[10:45] <chaoslynx> that doenst work thank you =)
[10:45] <cTheManiaKY> variant Did I lose you?
[10:46] <hastesaver> chaoslynx, what does "doesn't work" mean? And how are you trying to upgrade to edgy?
[10:46] <chaoslynx> i did the upgrade with the normal upgrade manager and it dowenloaded the packages over nigtht
[10:46] <Genrl_Zod> haha woot
[10:46] <chaoslynx> during the installation it stopped because one package couldnt be removed
[10:47] <viller> how can I check my IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and name servers?
[10:47] <chaoslynx> its a game package from an unsupported repository and contains an addon to ta-spring...
[10:47] <hastesaver> viller, /sbin/ifconfig should usually work. Of course, there is probably an entry in one of the menus, called "Networking" or something
[10:48] <Daverocks> viller: ifconfig for IP address and subnet mask, "route -n" for default gateway and "cat /etc/resolv.conf" for nameservers
[10:48] <Genrl_Zod> ok guys, i need the absolute idiots guide for ubuntu pls. I am no way familair with linux and ive succesfully managed to install ubuntu with winxp and now succesfully installed vmware using ubuntu as the guest OS. Now that i have the guests syystem, are there any advisable like video tutorials to develop my current knowledge (zilch) of ubuntu
[10:48] <Daverocks> viller: you might need to do "route -n" and possibly "ifconfig" as root
[10:49] <hastesaver> ifconfig doesn't need root... it's just that /sbin is in the default path for root, and not in the default path for normal users
[10:49] <chaoslynx> hastesaver: I tried to use apt-get autoremove -f but it didnt work... so i just want to remove it manually from the list so that it is ignored
[10:49] <cTheManiaKY> variant Well I apprecate the help and atleast I know the card works. I'll try to continue to work on it in the morning. Its 4:47am where I'm at and I'm heading to bed. (Like I should have 5 hours ago). THanks again
[10:49] <Daverocks> hastesaver: that's why i said _possibly_ :P
[10:49] <Daverocks> hastesaver: on some distros it's only executable by root, and i wasn't sure about ubuntu
[10:50] <hastesaver> chaoslynx, I was about to suggest "apt-get install -f", but if you've already tried that...
[10:50] <hastesaver> chaoslynx, then I'm out of my depth there :-)
[10:50] <viller> thanks daverocks and hastesaver
[10:50] <Daverocks> viller: yw
[10:50] <chaoslynx> hastesaver: ok thanks anyway, do you know anybody who could help me?
[10:51] <selinuxium> hi all, i and trying to use a cgi script on apache, but it just displays the file and doesn't run it.  the file and folder is set to 0755 +x. any ideas?
[10:52] <anthonyc> the problem may be within your apache/httpd.conf file
[10:52] <anthonyc> sounds like you need to enable the AddType for .php files in it
=== cTheManiaKY is now known as TheManiacKY
[10:52] <selinuxium> anthonyc: ok, cgi but I get what you mean :)
[10:53] <anthonyc> err yeah
[10:53] <viller> it seems like i have the same ip for name server and gateway. Is it normal or I made a mistake?
[10:53] <Daverocks> viller: no, that's a common configuration
[10:53] <anthonyc> thats normal
[10:53] <viller> ok thanks again
[10:54] <Daverocks> viller: often the gateway will run a DNS server and route DNS requests to another public DNS server
[10:54] <beasty> is that possible ?
[10:54] <boink> but the gateway doesn't have to be the dns server
[10:54] <Daverocks> boink: no, but it's a "common configuration" ;)
[10:55] <boink> very common, yes
[10:55] <boink> and it's nice to keep things simple :)
[10:55] <Daverocks> yeah, like when my dns is down, i switch to 4.2.2.2
[10:55] <boink> 4.2.2.2 must be the most used dns on the internet :)
[10:55] <Daverocks> i know lol
[10:55] <boink> nice to them :)
[10:55] <Daverocks> thank you level3 ^_^
[10:55] <boink> s/to/of/
[10:56] <Minty> hi all
[10:56] <anthonyc> 4.2.2.2 was the DNS i used
[10:56] <anthonyc> when customers would call for tech support
[10:56] <boink> well, athonyc ... you should ideally use the dns you've been assigned to
[10:57] <boink> using 4.2.2.2 is a "dirty hack"
[10:57] <anthonyc> right.. unless you have no clue what their ISP is and neither do they
[10:57] <anthonyc> so you use whatever works for them
[10:57] <Daverocks> exactly, when they call tech support :P
[10:57] <boink> or you can tell ask them to ask their ISP
[10:57] <Daverocks> but they don't know what an ISP _is_
[10:57] <anthonyc> I of course use the closest DNS server to me in hops
[10:57] <boink> that's their problem
[10:57] <anthonyc> my isp's lol
[10:58] <boink> one shouldn't be so lazy in life

[11:14] <Genrl_Zod> when say stuffed, meaning it just stalls and like a pixelated line shows up and nothing more happens
[11:14] <mtyhome> hi
[11:14] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  hmm... did you recently try switching vid drivers?
[11:15] <tsmithe> yo! are there any win64 users in here?
[11:15] <tsmithe> (
[11:15] <SilentDis> tsmithe:  nope, only us real OS users *snicker*
[11:15] <Genrl_Zod> silent dis i am sure u are right that ius is a videodriver prob as i have been googling this up
[11:15] <Genrl_Zod> basically i am running XP Pro and thru it i have managed to install VM ware.
[11:15] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  what vid card?
[11:16] <tsmithe> SilentDis: i know; but i have a web page that needs testing (offers the correct ubuntu cd to download)
[11:16] <Genrl_Zod> My master disk is partioned in 3 partions
[11:16] <tsmithe> (and i do run only Ubuntu myself)
[11:16] <SilentDis> tsmithe:  ahhhh
[11:16] <Genrl_Zod> 35gb for XP, 2gb for linux swap file and 32 gig for Ubuntu
[11:16] <tsmithe> so are there any WIN64 USERS?
[11:16] <Genrl_Zod> so i set up VMware to use the above credentials and started the virtual machin e using the physicval disk configuration
[11:17] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  you'll probably need to reconfigure x to use the basic vesa driver to get it to work right from such a setup
[11:17] <tsmithe> hi MrFlex:
[11:17] <Genrl_Zod> How would i do that mate?
[11:17] <tsmithe> MrFlex: do you have Win64?
[11:17] <tsmithe> damn!#
[11:18] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  after it boots, in the window, hit ctrl-alt-f1.  should bring you to a command prompt window you can log into
[11:18] <Genrl_Zod> i am a complete noob but i have come across the VESA u mentioned etc
[11:18] <Genrl_Zod> ok i have the session open now, let me try
[11:18] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  then, from the prompt, type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

I can't fully recall what version he's on but it is 6.x.  Are there any issues with dhcpd on recent versions ?

[11:21] <Gavrila> no one experiencing problems with full screen divx?

[11:22] <Genrl_Zod> yes i am ruinning vmwarer in xp

[11:23] <user-land> I need more then 1024 open files for a Wine process. How can i achieve this on Ubuntu ?
[11:23] <Adross> SilentDis: which parameters do i use with wget
[11:23] <Genrl_Zod> When set up vmware it asked me what type of HDD i want, one option was vistual but as i had ubuntu already installed ona partition i just pointed to that (so i chose physical disk as opposed to virtual disk)
[11:23] <LesleyB> man wget is your friend
[11:23] <SilentDis> LesleyB:  very much agreed hehe
[11:24] <SilentDis> Adross: wget -r -l1 --no-parent -nc <full site address>
[11:25] <SilentDis> Adross: that should just download everything on that page, and that page alone, and make no changes.
[11:25] <Genrl_Zod> ahh when booting up and asking me which OS to selct there is an option to press C
[11:25] <Genrl_Zod> WHICH HAS TOOK ME O THE COMMAND PROMPT

[11:25] <Gavrila> SilentDis, I don't think that VLC has anything to do with kubuntu, and actually I'm not using kubuntu
[11:25] <SilentDis> Genrl_zod that's grub's prompt, i think.

[11:26] <Genrl_Zod> so im stuffed then, i cant do jack squat?
[11:26] <Angela_p00f> I just mounted CD from commandline... how do I switch to the CD, so I can navigate it via commandline ? tia :)
[11:26] <m4steR> solutions?
[11:26] <SilentDis> Gavrila:  you can try using synaptic to reinstall the program and it's codec.  not sure what could cause that problem though, to be honest.
[11:26] <Daverocks> Angela_p00f: find the directory where it's mounted by typing "mount", and cd to it
[11:26] <blackmamba> Hey, I'm having some trouble booting into Ubuntu from my install CD. When I boot up with the CD inserted, my computer boots into Linux and gives me the boot menu. When I select the Start or Install Ubuntu option, I get a loading screen, and then a series of random light-blue characters and green dots form a line across my screen. I'm trying to boot with 6.10. If you need more information, please ask me.
[11:27] <Chameleon22> i rebooted, not sure what happened before but all of the sda devices went mssing and now none of the USB devices (usb drive, usb flash drive, ipod) are loading - any suggestions?
[11:27] <Genrl_Zod> ha thats my issue black mamba
[11:27] <SilentDis> m4steR:  what version of ubuntu, what version of firefox, what version of flash player?
[11:27] <Genrl_Zod> but im not going from live CD
[11:27] <Genrl_Zod> im going from VMWare
[11:27] <Genrl_Zod> i think silent has teh answwer to ourt problems
[11:27] <SilentDis> blackmamba:  how much memory on the box?
[11:28] <blackmamba> um, how much ram?
[11:28] <SilentDis> blackmamba: yes, how much ram? :)
[11:28] <blackmamba> SilentDis: lol, i'm pretty sure i've got 1 gig
[11:28] <blackmamba> yeah, 1 gig.
[11:28] <SilentDis> in genral terms, the liveCD doesn't like to work with less than 512, I think 256 is the lowest.
[11:29] <D1> Hey
[11:29] <D1> Anyone wanna give me a hand?
[11:29] <SilentDis> blackmamba, Genrl_zod:  it really sounds like something is going wrong with the video settings somewhere.  never herd it that bad or that early
[11:29] <SilentDis> !ask > D1
[11:30] <Genrl_Zod> ur ight silenmt it is a video setting
[11:30] <Genrl_Zod> my issues is whow i bloddy even get to the command prompt thru vmware
[11:30] <jamendo> hi there ! Is it possible to upgrade a debian to ubuntu with a dist-upgrade ?
[11:30] <blackmamba> i have 1024 megs, i just checked. if it's any help, when i change the display option from VGA to 1024 x 768 x 32, the loading process completes, but instead of going to gnome I go to a console
[11:30] <Genrl_Zod> im pretty sure if i physically rebooted my PC, i can get into ubuntu
[11:31] <D1> Anyone know anything about steam4linux?
[11:31] <Genrl_Zod> let me try
[11:31] <Genrl_Zod> and ill reportt back
[11:31] <SilentDis> blackmamba:  try reconfiguring x from the prompt.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:31] <Genrl_Zod> if that works then at least we can safely say the issue resides within VMWare sumwhere
[11:31] <D1> Anyone using steam4linux?
[11:31] <SilentDis> !steam4linux
[11:31] <CharminTheMoose> i've got a Dell Wireless 1450 WLAN (802.11 a/b/g) USB 2.0 Adapter and i'm wondering how do i getting it working under dapper drake?
[11:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about steam4linux - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:32] <SilentDis> D1:  sorry, i know nothing, and nor does ubotu apparently
[11:32] <D1> Oh
[11:32] <D1> Damn
[11:32] <blackmamba> SilentDis: i'll try that right quick. so you know, i'm still fairly new to linux and i don't really know my way around yet :P be right back with results hopefully
[11:32] <CharminTheMoose> anyone?
[11:33] <Lathiat> D1: yeh, im using it with the crossover 6 beta
[11:33] <JDahl> CharminTheMoose, unless it works out of the box, your best bet is probably ndiswrapper
[11:33] <Lathiat> d1: works a treat
[11:33] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: is it hapenning ?
[11:33] <SilentDis> blackmamba:  we're all beginners at something.  I learn new stuff every day :)
[11:34] <blackmamba> :D
[11:34] <CharminTheMoose> JDahl:ok i'll try that. And can i see what dependancies ndiswrapper has and then download both ndiswrapper for ubuntu and it's dependancies?i'm on a debian box atm
[11:35] <gerhard> hi
[11:35] <jamendo> Is it possible to upgrade a debian to ubuntu with a dist-upgrade ?
[11:35] <SilentDis> !upgrade
[11:35] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[11:35] <jamendo> thx
[11:35] <SilentDis> jamendo: :)
[11:36] <Spee_Der> Good morning everyone. . .
[11:36] <jamendo> SilentDis, this page doesn't mention Debian
[11:36] <jamendo> just ubuntu->ubuntu upgrades
[11:36] <Genrl_Zod> ok i tryed it silent
[11:36] <Genrl_Zod> booted in fine
[11:37] <Genrl_Zod> str8 past the spalch screen, to logon screen.
[11:37] <Genrl_Zod> Not an issues with ubuntu files, system config. Seems like something within VMWARE doesnt liek the graphical interface as it get tot the end of the loading bar
[11:38] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  obviously, the VM box uses it's own set of vid drivers.  a fresh install to a fresh VM ware would work, more than likely.  remember, the 'hardware' that ubuntu sees when booting from the VM is totally different than when booting from your computer for real
[11:38] <BrightEyes_> hello.how can i add installation sources on kubuntu?
[11:38] <Genrl_Zod> u kniow syumthign man, im looking at my vmware config and it lists all the devices i am using and there isnt a grpahics card added in that list
[11:38] <tamacracker> Hey guys.. I have a question!
[11:38] <SilentDis> !ask > tamacracker
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> oops my bad, u cant choose one anyways
[11:39] <tamacracker> Is it possible to tweak your cable modem in order to make the connection faster?
[11:39] <minimec> BrightEyes_:  gksudo kedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:39] <Genrl_Zod> so u suggest i uninstall vm?
[11:39] <KenSentMe> jamendo: it's not a good idea to dist-upgrade from debian to ubuntu. Maybe you can save your config files in /etc and /home and use them after a fresh install, but an upgrade is not possible
[11:40] <SilentDis> tamacracker:  maybe, but it's not something we'd have much assistance for.  we're here to help with Ubuntu Linux problems and such, not cable modem configs :)
[11:40] <augustin> how can I connect my Ubuntu computer to a Windows notebook?
[11:40] <jamendo> ok KenSentMe ...
[11:40] <compengi> KenSentMe, hi, i have a vga driver issue can you help me?
[11:40] <jamendo> what's the technical reason for that ?
[11:40] <tamacracker> Oh.... SilentDis, if you don't mind me askin, do you know of a source or even a channel that could help me tweak my connection, please?
[11:41] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  installed or uninstalled is up to you... as I said, you can probably do a fresh install to a VM Ware partition of Ubuntu if you care to run that way, and it should work.
[11:41] <augustin> how can I connect my Ubuntu computer to a Windows notebook?
[11:41] <Spee_Der> tamacracker: You might try #hardware channel....
[11:41] <minimec> augustin: Do it the other way ;) Connect your windows notebook to your ubuntu computer... (ubuntu running 'firestarter', a basic firewall with masquerading ;) )
[11:41] <Genrl_Zod> sorry mate im a noob is hat ur sayign is that i boot dorect of thr CD via vmware and create and fresh instal of ubuntu right?
[11:41] <SilentDis> tamacracker:  from the limited info I've gleamed from fieldwork, it's usually dependant on the hardware you're using, and the service you're using.  maybe a google search for the service provider and modem manufactuerer info would help :)
[11:42] <BrightEyes_> minimec: which sources i may add for extra software\\?
[11:42] <tamacracker> Thank you Spee_Der and SilentDis!
[11:42] <CharminTheMoose> JDahl:ok i'll try that. And can i see what dependancies ndiswrapper has and then download both ndiswrapper for ubuntu and it's dependancies?i'm on a debian box atm
[11:42] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  if you wish to use Ubuntu inside VMWare, it'll probably have to be it's OWN install.  if you want to use ubuntu as your main os on your system, you're all set and don't have to do anything
[11:42] <compengi> SilentDis, , hi, i have a vga driver issue can you help me?
[11:42] <augustin> minimec: bash: firestarter: command not found
[11:43] <variant> augustin: easy way is to install firestarter and enable internet connection shareing (NAT and dhcp) then plug in an ethernet cable between the two
[11:43] <CharminTheMoose> how can i see what dependancies ndiswrapper has and then download both ndiswrapper for ubuntu and it's dependancies?i'm on a debian box atm
[11:43] <Genrl_Zod> i was debating that i defo need windows and i defo want ubuntu to learn linux
[11:43] <InvisiblePinkUni> ubotu: tell me about NAT
[11:43] <Genrl_Zod> so i though win wud be main and use ubuntu via win
[11:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about NAT - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:44] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: what do you want to know about it?
[11:44] <Olathe> How do I change the number of consoles from six ?
[11:44] <Spee_Der> CharminTheMoose: If you are using ADEPT, you can search NDISWR and look at the details listing.
[11:44] <SilentDis> Genrl_Zod:  that would be a 'perfect world' setup, for sure... but it's doubtful it'll work that great, unfortunatly :(
[11:44] <compengi> SilentDis, i know lol but i was just making sure if you're familliar with those issues :)
[11:44] <Ackeee> hey i need a network monitor as my broadband seems to go up and down in a bad way. any suggestions?
[11:44] <Genrl_Zod> so u #suggets i use ubuntu as main OS and use XP as guest OS?
[11:44] <compengi> SilentDis, , i had like one month ago installed nvidia-glx-legacy and it was working fine but i found in how to install nvidia that my driver was wrong and i need to install nvidia-glx for fx 5500 so i did but when enabling the driver i get the error =/
[11:44] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: i am gettting a single ethernet cable to my room. i want to split it to two computers, so what is the best way?
[11:44] <SilentDis> compengi: just ask to the channel hun, if I can't answer, someone else might chime in and help more :)
[11:44] <augustin> minimec: tnx, I am just installing firestarter
[11:44] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: is putting up a router and creating a NAT the best solution?
[11:45] <minimec> BrightEyes_: If you only use the standard repositories, then open synaptic (gksudo synaptic), go to the sources in the menu and activate 'universe' and 'multiverse'. You can also '#' uncomment 'universe' and 'multiverse' in /etc/apt/sources.list.
[11:45] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: either buy a router or another network card for one of the computers
[11:45] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: yes, NAT is the simple way
[11:45] <compengi> SilentDis, the error is Error: your X configuration has been altered.
[11:45] <compengi> This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this
[11:45] <compengi> not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
[11:45] <compengi> command:
[11:45] <minimec> augustin: sudo apt-get install firesarter ;)
[11:45] <compengi> md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum
[11:45] <compengi> otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section
[11:45] <compengi> from nv to nvidia.
[11:45] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: you can enable NAT with just annother nic card on one computer and conect theother computer to that one
[11:45] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: saves money on buying a router
[11:45] <SilentDis> !paste > compengi
[11:46] <compengi> okay
[11:46] <Chameleon22> i rebooted, not sure what happened before but all of the sda devices went mssing and now none of the USB devices (usb drive, usb flash drive, ipod) are loading - any suggestions?
[11:46] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: oh will it?
[11:46] <augustin> minimec: I already did:)
[11:46] <SilentDis> compengi:  it sounds like you need to reconfigure X on your machine.
[11:46] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: save money? yes nic cards are cheaper than routers
[11:46] <SilentDis> compengi:  i assume you used either apt-get or synaptic to get the nvidia-glx driver, right?
[11:46] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: i have a adsl router... will that work? or do i need another kind of router?
[11:46] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: but to use the computer atthe end of the chain you will need to have the other computer switched on. if thats not an option then a router is the way to go
[11:46] <compengi> SilentDis, yes i used repos
[11:47] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: any kind of router will do
[11:47] <SilentDis> compengi: ok.  did you enable it?
[11:47] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: as long as it has two spare rj45 sockets
[11:47] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: oh ok...
[11:48] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: i want to keep both computers independent... i will go for the router option
[11:48] <SilentDis> compengi:  actually, i hate to refer you away, but the page is AWESOME at getting this setup.  helped me immensely :)
[11:48] <SilentDis> !nvidia
[11:48] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:48] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: thanks a lot :)
[11:48] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: yw
[11:48] <InvisiblePinkUni> long live linux
[11:48] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: long live free software*
[11:48] <Tompu> :o linux is free?
[11:49] <SilentDis> Tompu: as in beer, yes! :D
[11:49] <SpComb> ya rly
[11:49] <RVman> Tompu, lol
[11:49] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: :)
[11:49] <blackmamba> SilentDis: Okay, I'm back. I have an error, too. When I got to the boot select screen, I chose 1024x768x32 for my display instead of VGA. After Ubuntu finished the loading screen, I got a black screen with a blinking cursor at the top-left, and then an error message saying X Server is not configured properly, would you like to see the error report. I looked through the detailed error report and right at the end it says...
[11:49] <rob> free as in freedom, yes
[11:49] <minimec> augustin: ok. now you have to configure firestarter. You should have two network connections, one for the WAN, and one for LAN. You have to configure WAN for DHCP and LAN with a local network ip like 192.168.1.101 ...
[11:49] <RVman> however i still prefer windows :P
[11:49] <Ackeee> !networkmonitor

[11:49] <user-land> does Ubuntu use a start-up script like /etc/rc.d/rc.local ?
[11:50] <compengi> SilentDis, i installed before nvidia-glx-legancy and it worked but it's not the right driver for my vga (fx 5500) so i removed it and installed nvidia-glx and while enabling the driver i get this error
[11:50] <blackmamba> PCI Mach64 in slot 1:0:0 has not been detected! PCI Mach64 in slot 1:0:1 has not been detected! No devices detected! Fatal Server Error no screens found
[11:50] <variant> user-land: yes, use update-rc.d to add/remove from it
[11:50] <Daverocks> blackmamba: do "sudo lspci" and see which bus your graphics is on
[11:51] <compengi> SilentDis, i also tried to change it from nv to nvidia and back words but unfortunatelygot same result
[11:51] <blackmamba> Daverocks: i don't have an opportunity to. after i get out of the error window, i am greeted by a black screen. i can still enter text, but it has no effect
[11:51] <Daverocks> blackmamba: try pressing ctrl-alt-F1
[11:51] <blackmamba> ctrl-alt-f1... okay, i'll be back soon.
[11:52] <blackmamba> thanks, by the way :)

[11:56] <CharminTheMoose> where is the place on ubuntu.com that i can search the ubuntu repository for a specific package?
[11:57] <rarj> im getting this error on totem - "No URI handler implemented for "vcd"
[11:57] <variant> user-land: there you go, add the lines to /etc/rc.local
[11:57] <rarj> I also need to be able to play dvd/vcd/mp3
[11:57] <mixandgo> I've installed beryl and I now get direct rendering: No ! any idea how fix this ?
[11:57] <variant> user-land: you know that some of that doesnt apply to 2.6 kernels?
[11:57] <Daverocks> mixandgo: that's normal
[11:58] <Daverocks> mixandgo: Xgl disables direct rendering because IT uses gl
[11:58] <variant> mathieu_: your using proprietry drivers and xgl?
[11:58] <mixandgo> Daverocks, oh ! I see...
[11:58] <variant> mathieu_: if possible, use aiglx. it doesnt have this problem
[11:58] <variant> xgl is dead :)
[11:58] <user-land> variant, i am trying to write a howto for this for edgy. would you like to have a look at it in half an hour ?
[11:58] <Daverocks> yeah but aiglx is a bit fiddly
[11:59] <crimsun> eh? aiglx+i915gm+xfwm4's compositor is straightforward
[11:59] <variant> Daverocks: not at all, much simpler than xgl as it works out of the box with 7.1 xorg
[11:59] <variant> user-land: sure thing
[11:59] <Daverocks> variant: oh
[12:00] <variant> Daverocks: all you have to do on aiglx is run beryl-manager and it works
[12:00] <rarj> How do play dvd/vcd and mp3 in Ubuntu Dapper?
[12:00] <variant> rarj: ogle is good for dvd's
[12:00] <InvisiblePinkUni> rarj: use totem

[12:00] <freacky22527> join /ubuntu-fr
[12:00] <rarj> yes... ive tried totem but it throws up errors
[12:00] <variant> rarj: totem is crappy
[12:01] <rarj> ogle ?
[12:01] <variant> rarj: mplayer will play all formats except broken wmv files
[12:01] <InvisiblePinkUni> totem with xine plugins is ok
[12:01] <variant> rarj: broken with drm that is
[12:01] <rarj> how do I install mplayer
[12:01] <InvisiblePinkUni> totem with gstreamer doesnt play most things
[12:01] <variant> rarj: apt-get install mplayer
[12:01] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: yeah, whats the install file for xine totem backend?
[12:02] <viller> I want to use a font I downloaded as the titlebar font, but gconf-editor isn't able to change the font. I can use fonts previously installed. And I can use the new fonts in GIMP.
[12:02] <anto> can anyone her help me install PDO ?
[12:02] <CharminTheMoose> how can i manually download a packge from the ubuntu package repository?
[12:02] <variant> viller: it's probably the theme you need to edit
[12:02] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: i went to synaptic and installed it. just a second... let me see
[12:02] <variant> CharminTheMoose: get the url and wget it
[12:03] <viller> why the theme? I can use the old fonts
[12:03] <CharminTheMoose> and where would i find the url variant?
[12:03] <mixandgo> variant, so xserver-xgl is not necessary to run beryl ?
[12:03] <variant> CharminTheMoose: apt-get install it and when it trys to download the file you will see the url, ctrl c that
[12:03] <variant> mixandgo: correct
[12:03] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: totem-xine
[12:03] <variant> mixandgo: if you have aiglx
[12:03] <variant> mixandgo: and a supported card
[12:03] <rarj> variant: package mplayer has no installation candidate.
[12:03] <mixandgo> variant, what is aixgl
[12:03] <variant> rarj: ok, rather than fixing that why dont you give totem-xine a try
[12:03] <mixandgo> aiglx
[12:04] <variant> mixandgo: an alternative to xgl (its replacement)
[12:04] <mixandgo> variant, and where do I get it ?
[12:04] <blackmamba> Daverocks: okay, i'm back. ctrl-alt-f1 worked, and i tried sudo lspci. that was the command, right? i got a big block of text. what out of that text did you want to know?
[12:04] <variant> mixandgo: it is built into edgy
[12:04] <variant> mixandgo: you wont be able to use it if you have the propreitry ati drivers
[12:04] <CharminTheMoose> i'm running debian and i've got my ubuntu computer upstairs and it connects to my internet via a dell wireless usb adapter and it;'s not natively supported by ubuntu,so i need to install ndiswrappr
[12:04] <rarj> variant: apt-get install totem-xine ?
[12:04] <mixandgo> variant, I am using nvidia
[12:04] <variant> mixandgo: and if you have an nvidia card you have to use experimental drivers
[12:05] <variant> rarj: yep
[12:05] <boink> !tell CharminTheMoose about wireless
[12:05] <variant> mixandgo: avoid it for now untill the drivers are stableised
[12:05] <Daverocks> blackmamba: find where in the text it has the name of your graphics. (if some of it went off the screen, do something like "lspci | less" from a root shell) wherever you see the name, somehow record the PCI bus of that
[12:05] <variant> mixandgo: or buy a nice card with full free software support
[12:05] <InvisiblePinkUni> i installed ubuntu on a friends computer, and it doesn't play video. it plays flash. but strangely when mplayer is running in the background, and then if you open a video file with totem, it plays normally
[12:05] <mixandgo> variant, ok, thanks
[12:05] <viller> I want to use a font I downloaded as the titlebar font, but gconf-editor isn't able to change the font. I can use fonts previously installed. And I can use the new fonts in GIMP.
[12:06] <variant> blackmamba: lspci | grep agp
[12:06] <variant> blackmamba: lspci | grep VGA i mean
[12:06] <JDahl> CharminTheMoose, you can find the package from http://packages.ubuntu.com,  but don't you have an installation CD?
[12:06] <blackmamba> variant: i'll try that.  is it relevant that i have a radeon x700 graphics card?
[12:06] <pjotr> hi... i have a problem with the shutdown process of my ubuntu! the machine doesn't go off after the shutdown process! i alway have to use the power button! does anyone have an idea how i can solve the problem?
[12:07] <variant> blackmamba: what are ;you trying to do exactly?
[12:07] <InvisiblePinkUni> ubotu: screen
[12:07] <ubotu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[12:07] <blackmamba> variant: boot up ubuntu. so far, after it gets done with the loading screen, i'm presented with a "x server is not configured properly" error. then i get a command prompt
[12:08] <InvisiblePinkUni> everyone... GNU_Screen, is a teriffic program. just knew about it a couple of days back.
[12:08] <Toma-> im thinking about getting a notebook, and most cheap ones have an ati card in them. is this gonna be a huge problem? or is it really not that bad? i know nvidia is the go, but its gonna cost heaps more.
[12:08] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: thats what i use for irc + irssi. on a remote server :)
[12:08] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: screen -RRD is nice
[12:08] <Daverocks> Toma-: yeah, i find the nvidia drivers better than the ati, but the ati ones do work well
[12:09] <compengi> Toma-, no it's okay you can intall ati drivers
[12:09] <Toma-> cool
[12:09] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: i came across it by accident
[12:09] <Toma-> so they work + compile and so on?
[12:09] <variant> Toma-: go for one with an ati card that is either radeon 9250se or less
[12:09] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: it must be more prominent to new users  like me :)
[12:09] <Toma-> yeh
[12:09] <variant> Toma-: any other than that you will have to use proprietry drivers
[12:09] <minimec> variant: Do you know a good howto for aiglx+ati? I am runnig xgl on my Laptop but my Desktop has a fglrx incompatible card (saphire 9200).
[12:09] <blackmamba> variant: right, i'll go try the command you gave me and write down what it says. you want me to use sudo lspci | grep VGA?
[12:09] <variant> minimec: then you are very lucky
[12:10] <compengi> !ati > Toma-
[12:10] <Toma-> variant: and the GPL ones are better?
[12:10] <variant> Toma-: of course, they are free
[12:10] <Toma-> i c:D
[12:10] <variant> Toma-: pluss you will be able to use aiglx out of the box with no issues
[12:10] <Toma-> sweet
[12:10] <variant> Toma-: and you wont have to install any drivers, it will "just work"
[12:10] <lk11mn> ok here's an easy one for anyone that know the command line - i skrewed up my xorg.conf, and x wont load, how do i use my xorg.conf.backup, how do i rename them, or replace them?
[12:11] <anto> can somone tell me how do install the package containing phpize
[12:11] <variant> lk11mn: cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:11] <lk11mn> variant cp means/does?
[12:11] <variant> minimec: just install edgy, you will have 3d acceleration and aiglx automatically by default then install beryl-manager and your set
[12:12] <variant> lk11mn: copy
[12:12] <variant> lk11mn: copy from to
[12:12] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: me getting confused with -RRD switch looking at it in the man page. :)
[12:12] <tamacracker> Does anyone if IPV6 actually slows down internet connection?
[12:12] <variant> lk11mn: you will need to be root, or use sudo
[12:12] <minimec> variant: Does that work with a simple dapper upgrade?
[12:12] <keithhhhh> can anyone tell me how to setup bittorrent thru a router firewall
[12:12] <lk11mn> variant lol its so simple... thanks :)
[12:12] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: open two terminals (you can do it over ssh on annother computer if you like :)) start screen and run top in one of them
[12:12] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: in the other one do screen -RRD
[12:13] <Daverocks> keithhhhh: unblock the bittorrent port you are going to use in the firewall
[12:13] <variant> minimec: should do, i have heard of people having upgrade problems though
[12:13] <rarj> variant: done that... now totem comes up and goes away
[12:13] <variant> minimec: run the upgrade twice is reccomended and make sure your system is in a sane state before you start
[12:13] <variant> rarj: what do you mean?
[12:13] <lk11mn> How do i rotate my display 180 degrees? (that's the question that got me into this mess in the first place)
[12:14] <minimec> variant: ... and what about the two screens that are plugged on that card. Well I read that aiglx can handle one big framebuffer until 2048x2048 ...
[12:14] <variant> lk11mn: no idea
[12:14] <variant> minimec: yep
[12:14] <rarj> when I click on it, it flashes by.. it doesnt stay on the screen, comes up and shuts down
[12:14] <alyssum> my 'sans' font got mysteriously changed from the deafault Deja Vu Sans to something really awful looking...anybody know how can I fix it?
[12:14] <variant> rarj: hmm, open it from a terminal and see what the output says when you run it
[12:15] <rarj> variant: badalloc()
[12:15] <InvisiblePinkUni> variant: screen -RRD rules :)
[12:15] <minimec> variant: Hmm... So i would have one big cube for the two Desktops?
[12:15] <variant> InvisiblePinkUni: yep
[12:15] <variant> minimec: yep, apparantly, i dont have multiple monitors on my laptop though :)
[12:15] <compengi> variant, is the firefox still having a bug that won't let you open another one if you had already opened it on edgy?
[12:15] <variant> minimec: you can change that to be two seperate desktops etc..
[12:16] <variant> compengi: I have never had that issue and have been using fx for months
[12:16] <variant> compengi: edgy i mean
[12:16] <rarj> variant: badalloc()
[12:16] <variant> rarj: yeah i saw that.. its not good
=== zarul is now known as dido
[12:16] <minimec> variant: I will think about that. Normally I use E17 on my Desktop. E17 is handling the two Desktops in a quiet nice way...
[12:16] <variant> rarj: this is edgy?
[12:16] <rarj> no dapper
[12:16] <compengi> variant, do you have a good source list for it?
[12:17] <minimec> variant: THX anyway ;)
[12:17] <variant> compengi: just change all your lines from dapper to edgy
[12:17] <variant> compengi: on the official repos
[12:17] <rarj> variant: I actually wanna get rid of XP from my laptop.. so im setting ubuntu up
[12:17] <variant> rarj: ok
[12:17] <compengi> variant, you mean the same source.list?
[12:17] <variant> rarj: this is a problem
[12:18] <variant> compengi: yep
[12:18] <blackmamba> variant: okay, "sudo lspci | grep VGA" gave me this: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV410 [Radeon X700 (PCIE)] 
[12:18] <rarj> variant: looks like it :P. How do we solve it ?
[12:18] <variant> rarj: good question
[12:19] <variant> blackmamba: this is the live cd or the installed system?
[12:19] <blackmamba> variant: the livecd gave me that. i'm trying to boot into ubuntu from the livecd
[12:19] <variant> blackmamba: dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[12:20] <tamacracker> whoa
[12:20] <variant> blackmamba: did you try booting in safe graphics mode?
[12:20] <tamacracker> core2duo supposedly boosts up the cable modem connection

[12:22] <compengi> okay
[12:23] <variant> rarj: sorry, i am struggleing to think what could help here
[12:23] <blackmamba> Staz: when i boot into ubuntu from the 6.10 livecd/install disk, it goes through the loading screen and then i get an error saying xserver is incorrectly configured.
[12:23] <variant> rarj: have you used automatix or any other automating scripts at all?
[12:23] <JDahl> CharminTheMoose, on second thought,  there are probably some ndiswrapper packages you need to install manually.  Burning an installation CD (which includes those packages) from Windows or a different computer is that fastest solution
[12:24] <compengi> variant, should i leave it the same http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31190/
[12:24] <Staz> You get a black-screen by any chance?
[12:24] <rarj> variant: nopes
[12:24] <zaynhamdan> blackmamba: you can edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:24] <rarj> variant: I can try..... how do I install automatix
[12:24] <CharminTheMoose> JDahl yes but i already have ubuntu installinated
[12:24] <variant> rarj: I was not reccomending it
[12:24] <rarj> variant: :)
[12:24] <compengi> !automatix > rarj
[12:24] <variant> rarj: i was checking to see if it might have borked your system :)
[12:25] <Staz> http://pastebin.com/822426 <--- I had trouble installing edgy with that same card, I followed this.
[12:25] <rarj> compengi: Thanks
[12:25] <JDahl> CharminTheMoose, but you don't the ndiswrapper packages, which I why I suggest a CDROM image with the packages would be nice
[12:25] <variant> rarj: I am unable to help you i think, you can try asking others for help but if you wanna give automatix a shot be my guest. i dont recomend it though
[12:25] <blackmamba> Staz: at first, it went from the loading screen to a black screen to a command prompt, but now it goes from the loading screen to a black screen with blinking cursor to an error about xserver. i'll try that, staz, thanks
[12:25] <CharminTheMoose> yes,i understand
[12:25] <variant> rarj: be aware that it automates the installation of non-free software
[12:25] <netpython> automatix screws your system
[12:26] <compengi> variant, have you checked my source?
[12:26] <rarj> variant: Ok
[12:26] <variant> compengi: yep, itlooks fine. you might want to comment out the backports repo though
=== hume_ is now known as hume

[12:30] <variant> compengi: shame, you will loose all your data
[12:30] <Belboz99> I'm looking at this page, and it seems out of date.  It says that Mark might make Ubuntu BiArch compatable by Edgy Eft, and to "stay tuned".  Edgy has been released for weeks, is it BiArch compatable or not?

[12:30] <variant> compengi: i recommend that when yo uinstall ubuntu you choose to have /home mounted on a seperate large partition. it will save a lot of headaches

[12:32] <tamacracker> thank you :D
[12:32] <tamacracker> gonna try it

[01:28] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:28] <Bauke> variant; at the point a username is needed
[01:28] <sperry-> I did, I still get the same error when trying to apt-get mplayer. it worked for you guys right out of the box?
[01:28] <kuja_> sperry-: Everything works fine for me.
[01:28] <kuja_> sperry-: Run gmplayer
[01:28] <Bauke> variant; or any other keystroke
[01:28] <variant> Bauke: you enter your it wont let you enter the username or the password?
[01:28] <alecjw> shawarma: thanks! you're a life saver! (ish)
[01:28] <kuja_> Go to the preferences, and see if you can change the video output from there.
[01:28] <sperry-> "Depends: libartsc0 but it is not installable" (and same thing for 3 other libraries"
[01:28] <variant> Bauke: you tried pluggin/unpluggin your keyboar?
[01:29] <ZokiBoSS> variant, now?
[01:29] <ZokiBoSS> make[2] : *** [/home/zoki/Desktop/zr364xx-0.70/zr364xx.o]  Error 1
[01:29] <ZokiBoSS> make[1] : *** [_module_/home/zoki/Desktop/zr364xx-0.70]  Error 2

[01:29] <ZokiBoSS> make: *** [default]  Error 2
[01:29] <adam_> variant, do i need to rerun the whole install?
[01:29] <sperry-> kuja_ apt-get mplayer worked for you on 6.10 without any tweaking?
[01:29] <Bauke> variant: yes, and a different keyboard also. They both work with dapper
[01:29] <kuja_> sperry-: Correct
[01:29] <variant> Bauke: so.. that fixed it?
[01:29] <kuja_> sperry-: If you're having too many problems, just install VLC, or did you need to be able to play movies without a GUI?
[01:29] <bariel>  hello, using apt to install phpmyadmin, it gives me only the older version of 2.6, anyone knows if there is an more update source list?
[01:29] <variant> ZokiBoSS: paste the actual error not hte bit telling that there was an error
[01:30] <kuja_> VLC is the best movie player for Linux, in my honest opinion.
[01:30] <variant> ZokiBoSS: and put it in pastebin not htis channel
[01:30] <sperry-> ok I'll try VLC
[01:30] <kuja_> sudo apt-get install vlc
[01:30] <Bauke> variant: plug/unplugging didn't fix it. They both work with dapper
[01:30] <variant> kuja_: its not bad at all.
[01:30] <adam_> also, what is a good streaming player for ubuntu from the internet? gkstreamer? i want something to play all formats including wmv
[01:30] <ZokiBoSS> tell me web
[01:30] <variant> Bauke: thats very odd
[01:30] <minimec> sperry-:  mplayer seems to be in the 'multiverse' section. So an installation should work out of the box.
[01:30] <Bauke> variant: i was hoping to find a boot prm
[01:30] <variant> Bauke: are you sure it just doesnt echo the password ? you shouldnt see anything (no ****)  when you type the password
[01:30] <sperry-> for vlc I got "Depends: vlc-0nox (versioin) but it is not going to be installed"
[01:31] <sperry-> and "Depends libsdl-image1.2"
[01:31] <kuja_> sperry-: I don't think you enabled the necessary repository.
[01:31] <Bauke> variant: any other keystroke fails, numlock hangs and nothing happens
[01:31] <variant> Bauke: mad..
[01:31] <variant> Bauke: you might have a dodgey port?
[01:31] <Bauke> variant: when i boot back to dapper, everything's allright
[01:31] <sperry-> kuja_ just checked, both universe and multiverse are enabled
[01:31] <variant> Bauke: annoying
[01:32] <variant> Bauke: cehck for a bug report.. i havent heard of this before though
[01:32] <adam_> also, what is a good streaming player for ubuntu from the internet? gkstreamer? i want something to play all formats including wmv
[01:32] <variant> adam_: mplayer
[01:32] <kuja_> sperry-: Run sudo apt-get update
[01:32] <Bauke> variant: anyway, thanks for your help man. I'll file the bug then
[01:32] <variant> adam_: or vlc
[01:32] <variant> Bauke: np
[01:32] <adam_> variant, for some reason mplayer doesnt work on the internet for me, or am i missing a setting?
[01:32] <ZokiBoSS> variant, http://pastebin.com/822459
[01:33] <variant> adam_: mplayer http://host.com/stream.pls
[01:33] <sperry-> kuja_ I did smae thing
[01:33] <kuja_> sperry-: Do you have 'main' enabled?
[01:33] <adam_> thanks variant
[01:34] <sperry-> no it's disabled
[01:34] <kuja_> sperry-: Enable it and update again. Also enable restricted, for future stuff
[01:34] <JuliusSart> should the package installer inform if the password is incorrect, it does nothing atm.
[01:34] <kuja_> I usually enable everything, so I don't run into problems like these.
[01:34] <variant> ZokiBoSS: sorry, thats not somthing that i can fix. try different kernel/kernel headers and a different version of that driver (try compiling the older one first then get cvs if that fails)
[01:34] <marios_s> Hello, I've installed ubuntu on my acer aspire 1640, and then windows XP. I've a 3.90GB partition that I haven't removed at the begin of the hd. It probably contains a backup of drivers. After  installed XP it obviously overwrote grub, and now I can't boot linux, but the live. I tried to run grub-install again from the live but doesn't have work. So I've chrooted on the linux mounted partition but it says that it couldn't gethostbyname().
[01:34] <sperry-> works now :)
[01:34] <variant> ZokiBoSS: ask in the mailing list for that driver project
[01:35] <kuja_> sperry-: =)
[01:35] <manmadha> Is there any tool  to convert video to audio format....?
[01:35] <sperry-> thanks a lot, installing vlc now
[01:35] <felixjet> !xort
[01:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xort - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:35] <felixjet> !xorg
[01:35] <variant> manmadha: mencoder (if you have mplayer you allready have it
[01:35] <marios_s> Howvever, if I copy the grub conf in the live partition and I run grub-install will I be able to boot booth OS?
[01:35] <felixjet> !xorg
[01:35] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[01:35] <variant> manmadha: mplayer actualy
[01:35] <kuja_> sperry-: On Ubuntu, there shouldn't be much need for you to compile your favorite applications, they are already compiled for you and packaged in the repositories and can be installed via apt-get
[01:35] <crocd> marios_s: I had a similiar issue on my system give me second to think how i got around it.
[01:36] <variant> manmadha: just mplayer --dumpaudio /path/to/movie
[01:36] <variant> manmadha: iirc
[01:36] <manmadha> variant, ohh thank u i will try
[01:36] <variant> manmadha: readthe man page as it was many years since i did that :)
[01:36] <variant> manmadha: the command i showed you might not be exactly correct but that is certainly the way to do it
[01:36] <manmadha> variant, ohh ok ok
[01:38] <crocd> marios_s: I remeber booting to the livecd mounting the boot partition then running grub-install on the paritition, mine was (hd0,0) as it was a sata drive but it should be the same for yourrs)
[01:38] <variant> user-land: looks cool to me
[01:38] <kuja_> It takes forever to download these Ubuntu ISO's =(
[01:38] <variant> crocd: you dont need to mount the partition to run grub-install
[01:38] <variant> kuja_: try a different mirror/bittorrent
[01:38] <kuja_> variant: I'm using a local mirror.
[01:38] <variant> kuja_: or get a better connection :)
[01:38] <kuja_> kr.archive.ubuntu.com
[01:39] <kuja_> Well, it's retarded, My peak for this download is 700kb/s
[01:39] <variant> kuja_: i dl at approx 13mb/s when using a local mirror
[01:39] <kuja_> I should be getting at least 1MB/s
[01:39] <kuja_> variant: I know, it's stupid :(
[01:39] <user-land> thanks, variant. aMule is just not up to the task anymore. i'll need to see if 10000 is enough for eMule.
[01:39] <crocd> variant: i did try it without mounting but wasnt successful as it wouldnt detect the partition for some rason
[01:39] <variant> crocd: what command exactly?
[01:39] <variant> crocd: grub-install (hdo)
[01:39] <variant> crocd: grub-install (hd0)
[01:40] <kuja_> I'm going to install Ubuntu on my external USB harddrive through QEMU, because I don't have CD/DVD burner available :(
[01:40] <crocd> yep that was it but I had to specify (hd0,0)
[01:40] <variant> crocd: hd0,0 is the first partiion of the first disk, you want the master boot record which is on hd0
[01:40] <higi> hello
[01:40] <marios_s> Sorry, I couldn't follow.
[01:40] <higi> i disconnected my ipod without secure extraction, and now when i connect it to a PC it hangs
[01:40] <higi> is it fixable?
[01:41] <crocd> variant: as i have sata drive. I installed vista rc2 on a parition to see what it was like as a direct install
[01:41] <kuja_> higi: Send it in to Apple.
[01:41] <variant> higi: you can rerun the apple installer that will reset it to factory defaults
[01:41] <marios_s> I've linux on hda3, on the 0,0 I've the acer partition and hda2 the windows one.
[01:41] <variant> higi: you dont need to send it to anyone
[01:41] <higi> variant: but the pc doesnt detect the ipod
[01:41] <variant> higi: it doesnt matter
[01:41] <higi> how can i install the defaults?
[01:41] <variant> higi: just runt he program from the apple website
[01:42] <crocd> marios_s: you need to run grub-install (hd0,0) on your system to get grub to work. I also had to make the partition active/bootable
[01:42] <variant> higi: i dont rememebr the like exactly
[01:42] <kuja_> Well, if all fails and you can't recognize it, it could mean that it's not getting enough power (could be damaged)
[01:42] <higi> ok thanks ill try that
[01:42] <kuja_> So, if the Apple updater fails, send it in.
[01:42] <variant> higi: it worked last time i installed linux on one that went bad
[01:43] <kuja_> variant: I find that iPL is soooo immature.
[01:43] <crocd> marios_s: hang on I am going to check something
[01:43] <kuja_> It always went bad on my nano
[01:43] <variant> kuja_: nah, it's cool on some ipods
[01:43] <variant> kuja_: yeah, nano is development
[01:43] <marios_s> crocd, but it doesn't work from live, nor chrooting on the mounted linux partition.
[01:43] <kuja_> variant: Yeah
[01:43] <variant> kuja_: enables more audio formats even playing videos and games
[01:44] <kuja_> I would like to play videos (that would give me reason to buy the extended battery thing)
[01:44] <crocd> marios_s: can you mount the partition that your grub is on?
[01:44] <marios_s> If I copy the linux.bin on the windows partition and use the win bootloader is it going to work ?
[01:44] <kuja_> Even though the nano has such a smalls screen, it's cute :)
[01:44] <marios_s> crocd, of cours
[01:44] <marios_s> I can also chroot, but I've this error: couldn't gethostbyname()
[01:44] <variant> marios_s: so hda1 is acer partition, hda2 is linux hda3 is windows?
[01:44] <crocd> marios_s: to check on which partition you need to run grub install you need to read the menu.1st entries. that is how i was able to check on which one to run it.
[01:44] <marios_s> hda2 win, hda3 lin
[01:45] <variant> marios_s: and what is hda1?
[01:45] <crocd> variant: a driver partiotin
[01:45] <variant> marios_s: some kind of rescue partition?
[01:45] <crocd> variant: apparently
[01:45] <variant> how silly
[01:46] <splintax> yo
[01:46] <soon_> Hi folks - WEIRD SHIT GOING ON HERE ! I have an asus laptop - melted my LCD screen (long story), installed a new screen (from a dell, but same size etc). It worked fine for 3-4 days. Now the screen dims repeatedly (like the acpi controlled keyboard dim - function) - I can re-light the screen using the keyboard function, but alas it dims again after 0.1 - 5 seconds or so ...
[01:46] <marios_s> variant, yes :)
[01:46] <daywalker> hallo. i got a p4 - should i use the 686, or 386 generic kernel?
[01:46] <crocd> daywalker: 686
[01:47] <crocd> i think
[01:47] <crocd> check it though.
[01:47] <soon_> Im not even certain whether this is a software or hardware problem ... any suggestions?
[01:47] <daywalker> crocd, some sites say varying things
[01:47] <crocd> soon: have you tested a livecd to see what happens
[01:47] <daywalker> no i got 386 edgy generic running ok tho
[01:48] <soon> good idea ... crocd ... Ill try that !
[01:48] <variant> daywalker: edgy doesnt have that distinction
[01:48] <variant> daywalker: use generic
[01:48] <variant> daywalker: there is negligable difference in performance
[01:48] <daywalker> variant, thanks that exdplains it all
[01:48] <Poromenos> is there a command line bittorrent client i can install?
[01:48] <crocd> daywalker: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=85917
[01:48] <crocd> check that
[01:49] <variant> Poromenos: btdownloader
[01:49] <Poromenos> variant: thanks
[01:49] <xeon111> any one here can help me install real player
[01:49] <variant> Poromenos: not sure if thats the package name, thats the command though
[01:49] <daywalker>  variant but when installing beryl must i specifically use the. 386, not 386 generic kernel
[01:49] <xeon111> i have downloaded realplayer10gold.bin
[01:49] <Poromenos> variant: it's not the package name, i'll google it, thanks :P

[01:51] <ERIK_LIMA> Hello, everyone :)
[01:51] <marltu> ubuntu__: ctrl+alt+f1 f2 f3
[01:51] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu__, is the partition mounted? youll have to edit and navigate as root
[01:51] <variant> ubuntu__: ctrl alt f1 will switch yo to a virutal terminal that should allow you to log in via console
[01:51] <daywalker> crocd,  thanks
[01:51] <ubuntu__> how do i mount from a live cd?
[01:51] <crocd> daywalker: np
[01:51] <ERIK_LIMA> Can someone help me with the installation of the ATI driver??
[01:51] <winterp1> hi all
[01:51] <variant> ubuntu__: just reboot to the installed system
[01:51] <variant> ubuntu__: once the system has booted then type ctrl alt f1
[01:51] <InvisiblePinkUni> ubuntu__:  ctrl+alt+f1, then do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:52] <ubuntu__> oh ok
[01:52] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu__, man mount
[01:52] <xeon111> variant: can u give me the ful command
[01:52] <ERIK_LIMA> I hava serious problems with my ATI Radeon 9250. I can't get 3D aceleration
[01:52] <variant> xeon111: it tells you on that webpage you were about to go and read

[01:52] <xeon111> k
[01:52] <ubuntu__> error: mount: mount point /mnt/F does not exist
[01:52] <variant> xeon111: open the page and type ctrl f, then enter real and it will take you directly there
[01:52] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu__, mkdir /mnt/F
[01:52] <ubuntu__> ok
[01:53] <variant> ubuntu__: you DO NOT HAVE TO DO THAT
[01:53] <ERIK_LIMA> Can someone help me with ATI Radeon 9250 on Ubuntu??
[01:53] <xeon111> hey it has a real player in a debian package
[01:53] <ubuntu__> variant: mkdir: cannot create directory `mnt/F': No such file or directory
[01:53] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm user "Dapper"
[01:53] <nolimitsoya> variant, i agrre, but he might as well learn now. ittl come in handy later :)
[01:53] <variant> ubuntu__: reboot to the installed system, take the live cd out
[01:53] <sperry-> xgl is amazing :). I have two videos running full screen and I can watch them both by rotating the cube and they still run completely smooth
[01:53] <nolimitsoya> *agree
[01:53] <variant> nolimitsoya: lets just fix his problem
[01:53] <nolimitsoya> variant, this is one way of doing so :)
[01:53] <Poromenos> does anyone know the btdownloader package name?
[01:54] <variant> Poromenos: its probably bt
[01:54] <winterp1> beryl or  compiz?
[01:54] <minimec> sperry-: I do agree with you. XGL rocks ;)
[01:54] <Poromenos> variant: ah, let me try
[01:54] <variant> Poromenos: its btdownload not btdownloader sorry
[01:54] <ERIK_LIMA> Guys... do you have problems with aTI driver??
[01:54] <ERIK_LIMA> I have
[01:54] <xeon111> noo the link there is broken
[01:54] <Poromenos> variant: there's only gnome-btdownload, are you sure it's not graphical?
[01:54] <variant> ERIK_LIMA: yeah, they are closed source proprietry drivers. thats my main problem with then
[01:54] <variant> them
[01:54] <variant> Poromenos: positive
[01:54] <minimec> ERIK_LIMA: the 'ati' or the 'radeon' driver should do for your card in 2d mode.
[01:54] <Poromenos> variant: great, thanks
[01:55] <variant> Poromenos: its rtorrent
[01:55] <DrNick> hi all, just a quick one. anyone know how to start the 6.10 edgy installation process in text mode?
[01:55] <winterp1> i running emule and bittorrent on wine,  works  great
[01:55] <ERIK_LIMA> I need to solve this problem to run an Playstation emulator and then compare to Windows version
[01:55] <variant> Poromenos: apt-get install rtorrent
[01:55] <Poromenos> variant: ah
[01:55] <ubuntu__> variant: so when my monitor goes blank at login .. ctrl+alt+F1 .. then edit xorg.conf .. right? change the first resolution to something like "1024x768" right?
[01:55] <topyli> minimec: well, i'm running beryl on aiglx with the free radeon driver
[01:55] <Poromenos> variant: so what's btdownload?
[01:55] <Poromenos> a different program?
[01:55] <ERIK_LIMA> minimec: Do you know how I solve it?
[01:55] <variant> Poromenos: dunno what package it is part of, but i have a bunch of bt stuff installed
[01:55] <Poromenos> variant: ok, i'll try rtorrent, thanks :
[01:55] <Poromenos> :)
[01:55] <variant> ubuntu__: exactly
[01:56] <ubuntu__> variant: cool ty
[01:56] <variant> Poromenos: there is also bittornado
[01:56] <kuja_> DrNick: I'm doing it right now through "OEM" mode
[01:56] <variant> Poromenos: thats curses base
[01:56] <variant> d
[01:56] <cyzie> hello. i have a UPS , from ark power . the model is AP800U. there are 3 outlets where 1 outlet label backup outlet and the other 2 is label as surge only outlets. what are their differences?
[01:56] <ERIK_LIMA> ubuntu_: There's nothing wrong with my screen resolution..
[01:56] <winterp1> i think btdownload is a service, i got rid of it  coz it starts with the  system
[01:56] <Poromenos> variant: what's the difference?
[01:56] <DrNick> kuja_, and how'd I get into that?
[01:56] <soon> Good suggestion crocd .... its a hardware problem ... actually, the screen is dimmed even during bios boot :-(
[01:56] <kuja_> DrNick: Boot into it, but you need the Alternate CD I think
[01:56] <variant> Poromenos: different developer/interface/sourcecode
[01:56] <variant> Poromenos: try them both
[01:56] <ERIK_LIMA> Some 3D aplications run slowly, specially OpenGL aplications
[01:56] <DrNick> kuja_, oh great lol.  ok thanks
[01:57] <Poromenos> variant: i mean lookwise, ncurses versus whatever the other one is
[01:57] <ubuntu__> hey btw ... why is it that all my drives are listed .. both fat32 and ext3 .. but they cannot be opened ... and when i try to mount them it gives error .. is it not possible? or am i doing something wrong?
[01:57] <kuja_> DrNick: Yeah... I first got the Desktop, then I got the Alternate lol
[01:57] <variant> Poromenos: dunno, i havent tried them.
[01:57] <crocd> soon: it might be incompatible check the manufacturer of th screen you might be able to get around it if you can get it detected right from BIOS
[01:57] <Poromenos> variant: ah, great, thanks a lot
[01:57] <variant> Poromenos: there is also a deamon that willdownload in the background
[01:57] <ubuntu__> Live Cd -- no mount partitions?
[01:57] <Poromenos> variant: oh, those aren't daemons?
[01:57] <DrNick> kuja_, the normal CD is fine for most installs, but this is an old laptop with not a great deal or RAM so needs to be installed in text mode
[01:57] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: maybe you could start by saying which card and driver you're using
[01:58] <alyssum> ok, i didn't get any response the first time, it's kinda busy in here.  so i'll ask again:  my 'sans' font got mysteriously changed from the default Deja Vu Sans to some really awful looking font...anybody know how can I fix it?
[01:58] <variant> Poromenos: no, they are client applications. the deamon i am talking about runs in the background
[01:58] <crocd> ubuntu__: you need to manually mount them
[01:58] <kuja_> DrNick: Yeah, I'm installing on my USB external HDD via QEMU because I don't have  CD burner, so it's slow in a graphical mode.
[01:58] <ubuntu__> crocd: it fails
[01:58] <variant> ubuntu__: i told you to reboot and not use the live cd
[01:58] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: It's an ATI Radeon 9250
[01:58] <Poromenos> variant: ah, i thought i could launch them as daemons and close the session (doing it with ssh)
[01:58] <crocd> ubuntu__: it might detect them but not mount them.
[01:58] <Poromenos> variant: what's the daemon's name?

[01:58] <DrNick> kuja_, QEMU is slow at the best of times ;)
[01:58] <xeon111> er the link there is not working if any one there can help me just tell me how to install realplayer10gold.bin
[01:58] <Poromenos> variant: true
[01:58] <crocd> ubuntu__: what is the rror message
[01:58] <variant> Poromenos: dont know, i think its part of "bittorrent"
[01:58] <ERIK_LIMA> And I'm using the 8.29.6 driver
[01:59] <kuja_> DrNick: qemu -cdrom ~/Downloads/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso -boot d /dev/sda
[01:59] <kuja_> :)
[01:59] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: that one might work well with the free radeon driver
[01:59] <ubuntu__> yes variant .. i ty for that .. but i need to know how to mount if something else goes wrong .. i am about to reboot now ..
[01:59] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm trying to use the newer
[01:59] <winterp1> alyssum  did u install a theme lately
[01:59] <kuja_> DrNick: I really, really need a CD burner lol
[01:59] <DrNick> lol
[01:59] <ERIK_LIMA> But... don't work :(
[01:59] <ubuntu__> sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda10 /mnt/F
[01:59] <ubuntu__> mount: mount point /mnt/F does not exist
[01:59] <ubuntu__> sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda10 /mnt/F
[01:59] <ubuntu__> mount: mount point /mnt/F does not exist
[01:59] <alyssum> winterp1: no, but i think what caused it was enabling scim to be the default IME for all applications (used 'im-switch' command)
[01:59] <ERIK_LIMA> When I enter "fglrxinfo" on Terminal I get this
[01:59] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: what's "newer"? the fglrx driver from ati?
[01:59] <variant> ubuntu__: ok, i wont bother helping you seeing as you are to ignorant to listen
[01:59] <xeon111> the link there is not working if any one there can help me just tell me how to install realplayer10gold.bin
[01:59] <variant> ubuntu__: stop spamming
[02:00] <DrNick> kuja_, the anoying thing is my housemate has a copy of badget somewhere which would be fine for this laptop, but god knows where he's put it
[02:00] <DrNick> *badger
[02:00] <ERIK_LIMA> Yeah... I tried to use the new driver and don't work :(
[02:00] <kuja_> Obtain badger then :)
[02:00] <variant> xeon111: that is not he correct way to install realplayer on ubuntu. follow the instructions
[02:00] <crocd> ubuntu__: normally with ubuntu you need to mkdir /media/name then mount it otherwise it wont work
[02:00] <variant> !real | xeon111
[02:00] <DrNick> yeah I suppose lol

[02:02] <ERIK_LIMA> Yeah... What can I do??
[02:02] <ubuntu__> crocd:  ty .. but it fails
[02:02] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: try the radeon driver? :)
[02:02] <variant> ubuntu__: yes it does, you just need to create the directory that you intend to mount somthing on first
[02:02] <ubuntu__> mkdir gives an error
[02:02] <variant> mount whatever /mnt/A doesnt work because /mnt/A doesnt exist
[02:02] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm trying... but I can't solve my problem...
[02:02] <variant> ubuntu__: mount whatever /mnt/A doesnt work because /mnt/A doesnt exist
[02:02] <nolimitsoya> ubuntu__, youll need to mkdir as root
[02:03] <crocd> ubuntu__: did you create the folder under the /media/ area?
[02:03] <ERIK_LIMA> It passed two weeks since I'm trying to fix it
[02:03] <ubuntu__> oh!
[02:03] <variant> ubuntu__: you need root access to mkdir in /mnt
[02:03] <ERIK_LIMA> two weeks
[02:03] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: what do you have in xorg.conf then? radeon? ati? fglrx?
[02:03] <variant> ubuntu__: so sudo mkdir /mnt/A
[02:03] <ubuntu__> so all i do is sudo mkdir ?
[02:03] <ubuntu__> cool
[02:03] <ubuntu__> ty so much
[02:03] <jason3f23f> what would cause this ;   ata1 is slow to respond, please be patient

[02:04] <ERIK_LIMA> O Section "Device" I have this:
[02:04] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: well that's what you're using then. the radeon driver could give you 3d. the fglrx driver might do it too, but i don't think the ati one will

[02:15] <alyssum> ok, let me ask in a different manner: how do i change the definition of the 'sans' font that ubuntu uses?
[02:15] <whishup> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31199/
[02:16] <ERIK_LIMA> It's strange how the ATI driver work well on Windows XP and slowly on linux...
[02:16] <minimec> ERIK_LIMA: gksu update-manager -c 
[02:16] <Vorbote> Keyseir: Even if they may be packages with some weird propietary thingy (e.g., WinISO), you can unpack them with wine.
[02:17] <elTigre> minimec: do you have to upgrade to latest dapper packages before doing that?
[02:17] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: it's a different driver of course
[02:18] <whishup> Ok, I'll ask a simpler question, how do I format a drive trhough ssh?
[02:18] <minimec> elTigre: Probably not. The packages will be replaced by the edgy packages
[02:19] <sobersabre> whishup: you become super user (e.g. by sudo )
[02:19] <elTigre> mhhh I am a little behind, so that I am downloading 440 mb of patches right now
[02:19] <topyli> elTigre: better have dapper up to date, and ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-desktop installed
[02:19] <sobersabre> and run formatting comand on the device u wish to format.
[02:19] <virago> hello i have live CD ubuntu 5.1 can i save options on hdd ?
[02:19] <sobersabre> whishup: what FS do you wish to format the partition with ?
[02:19] <elTigre> maybe it's a good idea to have everything up to date
[02:19] <whishup> sobersabre: formatting command, all righty, well they are just file server type drives so whatever is safer and speediest
[02:20] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm upgrading to Edgy now :)

[02:20] <minimec> ERIK_LIMA: Good luck. It will take a while ;)
[02:20] <Vorbote> Keyseir: But I'm still perplexed. Why do you need the floppy disk installer? THe Installer CD is bootable, and you can install either directly or from an ISO image.

[02:23] <Keyseir> Vorbote: Well, I've tried multiple perfectly good ISO images and booted them up to install on vmware... no go without floppy images
[02:24] <Vorbote> Keyseir: Else I wouldn't be using a vmware session with IE7 in this very instant.

[02:29] <Vorbote> Keyseir: Hmmm, that may be the problem. the ISO may not have the eltorito bootmark sectors.
[02:30] <nolimitsoya> cornell, it the +b flag set for the partition?
[02:30] <Vorbote> But I don't see why not.
[02:30] <cornell> Yes, cfdisk says it's bootable
[02:30] <hektik> CORNELL GO INSTALL WINDOWS
[02:30] <topyli> virago: well you could do that, but i'm not sure how you get the live cd to read it at next boot
[02:30] <hektik> YOU FUCKIN NEWB
[02:30] <nolimitsoya> hektik, please
[02:30] <Vorbote> Keyseir: let me check something in tthe player.

[02:31] <dsoft> hiya
[02:31] <mamzers555> jatt; how to ignore in xchat?
[02:31] <cornell> He's ignored
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> mamzers555, /ignore <nick>
[02:32] <virago> topyli yes i must change sam boot parameters ar have boot on hdd ?
[02:32] <jatt> mamzers555: just type
[02:32] <jatt>  /ignore <username>
[02:32] <jatt> 
[02:32] <dsoft> can anyone tell me and app like Total commander? i ve seen someones, but they are toooooooooo slow
[02:32] <mamzers555> he is gone
[02:32] <timhaughton> Anyone know what package would bring in libssh?
[02:32] <mamzers555> jatt; thanks for that info
[02:32] <alecjw> Amaranth: did you just ban hektik?
[02:32] <timhaughton> Specifically the headers
[02:32] <Amaranth> alecjw: Yes.
[02:32] <nolimitsoya> dsoft, there are lots in the repos. just do a search :)
[02:32] <alecjw> cool
[02:33] <topyli> virago: no such kernel options that i know of. you'd need to modify the CD
[02:33] <nolimitsoya> Amaranth, thank you :)
[02:33] <Amaranth> I try. :)
[02:33] <dsoft> i ve tryed them (gnome commander, bsc, nautilus) but they are too slow
[02:33] <dsoft> 50 GB = 3:30
[02:33] <mamzers555> Amaranth; is this ignore done by ip or name?
[02:33] <dsoft> 3 hours and half i mean
[02:34] <kmon_> anyone knows how to use the package gfxboot-theme-ubuntu with ubuntu's grub? i.e. without installing a replacement for grub?

[02:34] <Amaranth> mamzers555: I think you can do either on
[02:34] <nolimitsoya> dsoft, what do you mean by slow? file transer rate is dependant on hdd throughput, not file manager
[02:34] <Amaranth> mamzers555: one*
[02:34] <warkruid> dsoft: midnight commander is fast but is it character based
[02:34] <cornell> mamzers555: I suspect you can't ignore someone who's not here.
[02:34] <mamzers555> Amaranth; i think ip is the better one
[02:34] <Amaranth> mamzers555: but you don't need to worry about him anymore

[02:35] <Vorbote> Keyseir: You can jump into the boot menu with vmware player. (THat's what I was checking). Have you triedthat?
[02:35] <Keyseir> Vorbote: boot menu?
[02:35] <Keyseir> Vorbote: Incidently, I've got my 'img's
[02:35] <virago> topyli https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
[02:35] <joel_> Hi everyone
[02:35] <Keyseir> Vorbote: Is there a reason I should want to not use the floppies and figure out how to make it boot from the iso?
[02:35] <joel_> Got a question
[02:36] <cornell> Any other ideas on the boot problem?
[02:36] <Vorbote> Keyseir: Vmware has a proper boot menu and BIOS configuration.
[02:36] <joel_> I'm trying to compile ndiswrapper but I seem to be missing some libraries
[02:36] <joel_> loadndisdriver.c:15:20: error: stdlib.h: No such file or directory
[02:36] <joel_> How can I fix this ?
[02:36] <Vorbote> Keyseir: Using the ISO would be faster, specially if you don't want to pop floppies in and out.
[02:37] <dsoft> ok!
[02:37] <dsoft> 45MB/s
[02:37] <topyli> virago: ahh there you go. it's a dapper feature though so you need a new cd
[02:37] <dsoft> thanks :D
[02:37] <Keyseir> Vorbote: I'm a veteran at booting from virtual floppies =/
[02:37] <dsoft> warkruid: thx :D
[02:37] <sharperguy> how do i use export to set a varable like $cheese ?
[02:37] <warkruid> dsoft: your welcome
[02:37] <Vorbote> Keyseir: The way you access the boot menu is by clicking really fast on the screen to lock in the mount, and hit escape. You'll get the boot menu.
[02:38] <Keyseir> Vorbote: OK
[02:38] <cello_rasp> how do i find out the type of shell i am using
[02:38] <Keyseir> Vorbote: I appreciate all the reference you've given me.
[02:39] <Vorbote> Keyseir: good luck with that.
[02:39] <joel_> Anyone can help me with that ?
[02:39] <jrib> cello_rasp: maybe  'echo $SHELL'  though that can get changed sometimes
[02:39] <warkruid> cello_rasp: you could look in /etc/passwd under your account name
[02:39] <sharperguy> joel_, sudo apt-get install build-essential ?
[02:40] <Keyseir> Vorbote: Thanks
[02:40] <cornell> I gotta move on, I'll just see if I an find another hd
[02:40] <topyli> joel_: you're missing some development libs. libstd-dev or similar
[02:40] <joel_> How come they don't get installed with gcc ?
[02:40] <topyli> joel_: because there are thousands of them
[02:41] <virago> topyli thx u :)
[02:41] <topyli> joel_: nobody knows what you'll be building at some point
[02:41] <joel_> sharperguy: Thanks !  It works
[02:41] <sharperguy> cool
[02:42] <joel_> I guess it makes sense but I would've imagined that stdlib.h would come preinstalled...
[02:42] <sharperguy> how do i use export to set a sting variable like $cheese to "hello"
[02:42] <warkruid> sharperguy: export cheese="hello" under bash
[02:42] <topyli> joel_: the library does but the header files don't
[02:43] <sharperguy> cheers
[02:44] <joel_> Ok, got another question here.
[02:44] <joel_> When doing sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
[02:44] <joel_> I get:
[02:44] <joel_> FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.15-26-amd64-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
[02:45] <joel_> I looked in the forums but the only solution I found for that was to install the latest ndiswrapper drivers....  which didn't work
[02:45] <warkruid> joel: compiled ndiswrapper apart from kernel?
[02:46] <joel_> warkruid: ?
[02:46] <joel_> warkruid: please use newbie talk :P
[02:46] <warkruid> joel_: version info on module conflicts with kernel
[02:47] <joel_> warkruid: ok, so how can I fix that ?
[02:47] <warkruid> joel_: the version of ndiswrapper is not compatible with the linux kernel your using
[02:47] <raghu206> do we have object dock for gnome ?
=== Deaigo is now known as BoggsBeer
[02:48] <joel_> warkruid: So, how can I fix that ?  I've tried two different versions already
[02:48] <topyli> raghu206: in the osx sense, no
[02:49] <raghu206> topyli, do we have any other
[02:49] <warkruid> joel_: have you tried to compile the ndiswrapper module?
[02:49] <Kzar_fr> HI,
[02:49] <joel_> warkruid: Just did
[02:50] <Kzar_fr> Is it the place to ask tips about Beryl configuration ?
[02:50] <topyli> raghu206: what do you want it to do? we just have panel applets for window management. window lists, window selectors
[02:50] <warkruid> joel_: sry. missed that.
[02:50] <rgl> hi
[02:50] <Minty> anyone know how in xchat to not show the message so and so has quit or joined
[02:50] <warkruid> joel_: source for ndis_wrapper up to date?
[02:50] <joel_> warkruid: It was the question I asked just before the one about ndiswrapper :P
[02:50] <raghu206> topyli, not exactly with fuctionality but for appearence
[02:50] <rgl> which package contains the development manual pages like socket(2)?
[02:50] <joel_> warkruid: Downloaded the latest from SF
[02:51] <jrib> rgl: manpages-dev
[02:51] <joel_> warkruid: Unless I do something wrong when compiling...
[02:51] <rgl> jrib, thx :)
[02:51] <sc0tty> hi
[02:51] <topyli> raghu206: what kind of "objects" does it "dock" anyway? i'm not very familiar with osx :)
[02:51] <Abst> If when I started Ubuntu for the first time, the refresh is out of range and Ctrl Alt F1 doesnt work, what can I do
[02:51] <warkruid> joel_: had the same problem  with a different module. Worked only for older linux versions. :-((((
[02:52] <cornell> I assume that ubuntu server will fit on 3 gig
[02:53] <warkruid> joel_: Had to manually change the sources. major bummer.
[02:53] <joel_> warkruid: I don't think that will happen
[02:53] <alecjw> cornell: yes, it will. it needs 500mb
[02:54] <topyli> raghu206: http://ubuntuforums.org/gallery/showphoto.php?photo=3990&cat=2&limit=recent
[02:54] <raghu206> i am unable to store video captured bu istanbul it abruptly quits with out saving can anyone pls help?
[02:54] <joel_> warkruid: Surely, there has to be a way to install a wireless nic in a less painful way.
[02:54] <warkruid> joel_: what was the error message again
[02:54] <cornell> Thanks alecjw
[02:54] <topyli> raghu206: something like that? it's essentially just an application launcher
[02:54] <raghu206> topyli, yah
[02:54] <bobbby> Hi, i have  a x64 with ati card box, and  while starting the live session of 6.10 the x windows doesnt start
[02:54] <bobbby> how do i solve this
=== user-land2 is now known as user-land
[02:55] <topyli> raghu206: install gdesklets and gdesklets-data and start playing :)
[02:55] <angryfirelord> do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and set driver to vesa
[02:55] <topyli> raghu206: they're pretty but utterly useless :)
[02:55] <joel_> warkruid: FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.15-26-amd64-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
[02:55] <alecjw> bobbby: does ity day anything like the x window sytem failed to start?
[02:55] <alecjw> *say
[02:55] <Genrl_Zod> why is it everytime i bootthe bvery first thing that starts to load is Grub stage1.5
[02:55] <warkruid> joel_: output of dmesg. type dmesg in command shell
[02:56] <warkruid> joel_: sry I mean what is the output of the dmesg command?
[02:56] <angryfirelord> bobby: what's happening is that Ubuntu is trying to load a generic ati driver, which never works. Set it to vesa and you should get X.
[02:56] <Genrl_Zod> ive installed ubuntu in teh same drive as a 2nd partition, how can i completely remove it and Grub and just boot back into windows without Grub being picked up on
[02:57] <joel_> warkruid: hmm...  there is a lot of stuff in there...
[02:57] <Kzar_fr> How comes Beryl Scale plugin doesn"t handdle key modifiers for mouse handling ?
[02:57] <apokryphos> !beryl | Kzar_fr
[02:57] <ubotu> Kzar_fr: beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[02:58] <topyli> Genrl_Zod: grub is what boots both your systems. removing it would not be smart
[02:58] <angryfirelord> Genrl_Zod: Well, there's no easy way to do that. What you could do is make Windows the only choice in GRUB and set the timer to 0.
[02:58] <joel_> warkruid: [25192.385311]  ndiswrapper: disagrees about version of symbol boot_cpu_data

[02:58] <Unimatrix9> any one succesfully running an lenovo laptop?
[02:58] <Genrl_Zod> how do i make the onvly choice as Windows?
[02:59] <mmcji> morning all
[02:59] <chaoslynx> hi, how can i remove a package without using a package manager... or how can i make the package managers forget that there is a package still installed?
[02:59] <topyli> Genrl_Zod: you never want to boot linux again?
[02:59] <Unimatrix9> any one succesfully running an lenovo laptop , and wich series is it running?
[02:59] <warkruid> joel_: ndiswrapper is compiled with a symbol boot_cpu_data, but the kernel does not recognize that.. MMM..
[02:59] <warkruid> joel_: brb

[03:02] <chaoslynx> I need to remove a package to upgrade to edgy... i tried hard to remove it with apt get but it wouldnt work... now i want that the package managers ignore the package i.e. that it doesnt appear in the list anymore can somebody help me to let this happen =)?

[03:02] <nolimitsoya> compengi, looks fine
[03:02] <gnomefreak> compengi: if you give me a few minutes
[03:02] <Genrl_Zod> Ok this is my story. My 80gb master disk is partioned in 3 (2gb for linux swap file, 35 gig for WinXP and teh rest for Ubuntu). When i boot up my PC i get a nice window asking me which OS to choose. I can boot in both (ubuntu/winxp) fine. Now in my windows i have installed VMWare. In VMware i have set it up so that it uses the physical installation of ubuntu to boot up in VMWare. The session boots up, gets to the Ubuntu screen, the loader starts
[03:02] <Genrl_Zod> Reaches the end and stalls
[03:02] <mmcji> i use the alt install cd's though as i get hung up with the reg install cd.... i have the 1st ubuntu loaded for about a year on the ibm, then since then i have loaded 6.10 ubuntu, the newest kubuntu and mepis...no problems on any of them
[03:02] <seif> hello, i finally got 3d rendering in dapper with fglrx, but there are so many howto out there for beryl, and they are all different, which howto is the definitive one?
[03:02] <Genrl_Zod> with a funny pixelated thin line actoss my screen in a hiorixzontal way

[03:03] <gnomefreak> compengi: looks fine depending on what you are doing
[03:03] <nolimitsoya> Genrl_Zod, booting a physical drive in vmware is knos to cause problems

[03:03] <seif> thanx jrib
[03:03] <compengi> cause*
[03:04] <Unimatrix9> Genrl_Zod, why not use an decent vmx?
[03:04] <sc0tty> huh nearly done with the upgrade 6.06->6.10
[03:04] <sc0tty> it took time
[03:04] <Vorbote> Sikon: that's a bug in freetype2, bug 54776 in case you want to complain at launchpad.
[03:04] <warkruid> joel_: sry. it seems I cant help you. It is a conflict between the kernel and the module.
[03:04] <Genrl_Zod> whats a vmx?
[03:04] <chaoslynx> i need somebodies help to remove a package without using the package manager because those wouldnt work....
[03:05] <trukosh> anybody who knows a time registration software for gnome?
[03:05] <Unimatrix9> Genrl_Zod,  a normal vertual machine
[03:05] <Sikon> Vorbote> is there any workaround?
[03:05] <Unimatrix9> virtual
[03:05] <gnomefreak> compengi: comment out the plf repo to start with than try again. it maybe because you have main restricted universe and multiverse on wone line (maybe). i have never done that.
[03:05] <joel_> warkruid: Just found another HOWTO about broadcom nics...  Will try that
[03:05] <Sikon> because it also makes text and toolbar icons disappear at random
[03:05] <joel_> warkruid: Thanks anyways
[03:05] <Genrl_Zod> ahh ok so when i get teh option to select virtual disk or Physical disk i should just go with rtual disk?
[03:05] <Kzar_fr> chaoslynx, what did APT told you when trying to remove it ?
[03:05] <jrib> chaoslynx: what package?  Can you pastebin the error you get? Have you tried using dpkg?
[03:05] <mmcji> Genrl_Zod: cool, i did not even know you could not that...most of the time i have my laptop loaded with  with freebsd and ubuntu.  i have xp loaded in vmware, but had no idea you would link to a traditional install of a os...wow
[03:05] <warkruid> joel_: Good Luck!
[03:06] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm back
[03:06] <Unimatrix9> Genrl_Zod,  What happens is the ubuntu install that you call is trying to mount the windows partition, wich is the partition you are running and then it locks, since that are two processes trying to do different things...
[03:06] <Genrl_Zod> If i do that then i have no reason to have Ubuntu physically installed on my HDD as a 2nd partition. I should just remove it right?
[03:06] <ERIK_LIMA> Wow... the update will take around 6 hours to accomplish
[03:07] <paul_> hello
[03:07] <CheshireViking> are there any limitations on a linux machine writing to an Win XP machine which has a NTFS formatted drive? I was under the impression that linux wasn't supposed to be able to write safely to an NTFS formatted drive, but on this ubuntu machine, I can copy data to the NTFS drive on a XP machine without problems
[03:07] <Unimatrix9> my point is , why donw you do an install on vmware, of your ubuntu disks, and use that one?
[03:07] <ERIK_LIMA> I must be patient to upgrade my Dapper to Edgy
[03:07] <sc0tty> ERIK_LIMA: it is slow here too :(
[03:07] <compengi> gnomefreak: now i got this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31212/
[03:07] <Unimatrix9> so to say an virtual mahcine
[03:07] <sc0tty> I started before going to bed, and i'm just finishing it now
[03:07] <infidel> while i was installing slackware on my usb external hdd i formated my ubuntu /boot partition is there a procedure to rebover the partition?
[03:07] <ERIK_LIMA> Sc0tty: Are you using ADLS connection?? Me too
[03:07] <chaoslynx> yes i tried apt and dpkg and both dont want to remove it out of several reasons its a data package of a game called ta spring so it isnt really important, i got it from an third party repository and it has broken dependancies i guess i tried to install severall other packages of the game and then remove them in other order but that wouldnt work either
[03:07] <sc0tty> ERIK_LIMA: yes
[03:07] <sc0tty> a lot to download
[03:07] <sc0tty> took like 1h30 to dl all the files
[03:07] <hyperstring> same here - but fine at work
[03:07] <ERIK_LIMA> Sc0tty: When you started? At night??
[03:08] <hyperstring> 40g pipe
[03:08] <apple-gunkies> my edgy upgrade just crashed in the middle with one cryptic message that my system may now be unstable. Is there any way to pick it up again?
[03:08] <sc0tty> I started yesterday, around 9pm
[03:08] <ERIK_LIMA> I started right now
[03:08] <hyperstring> yeah one of my servers crashed on upgrade to edgy
[03:08] <jrib> chaoslynx: can you pastebin the error messages you are getting?
[03:08] <hyperstring> we built another server and ported it accross
[03:08] <sc0tty> but I think it stayed hung on an "accept" box most of the night :)
[03:08] <hyperstring> then reset the first one
[03:08] <Ahmuck> i have a user who has installed ubuntu in a 1G partition on a 160G drive.  is there a way to resize the partitions from ubuntu?
[03:08] <marios_s> Hello, I've installed ubuntu and then windows. Now the problem is that I can't dual-boot with windows boot loader. I tried using live ubuntu and then running grub-install but there's no way also after chrooting on the brand-new linux partition.
[03:08] <chaoslynx> jrib: I am quite sure it wouldnt help but i can yes...
[03:08] <ERIK_LIMA> and so... why are finishing now? Did you turn off your computer?
[03:09] <sc0tty> no
[03:09] <sc0tty> I was away most of the day
[03:09] <sc0tty> well morning
[03:09] <sc0tty> it 3pm here
[03:09] <ERIK_LIMA> I hope I can fix my problem with ATI driver with this upgrade
[03:09] <marios_s> Ahmuck, try qt_parted
[03:09] <hyperstring> my laptop is perfect with 6.10 with 6.6 the wireless networking didn't work

[03:10] <mmcji> anyone know which repository OPERA is in.  I have Ubuntu 6.10 loaded, but am not able to apt-get or use synaptic to install it.  I can do a soure install, but would rather pull it out of a repository
[03:10] <jrib> chaoslynx: pastebin
[03:10] <gnomefreak> compengi: try a new list for edgy.
[03:10] <jrib> chaoslynx: pastebin /var/lib/dpkg/info/spring-basedata.postrm
[03:10] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: the new X version in edgy broke my matrox driver (free matrox drivers have worked forever), so maybe they compensated it by fixing another brand
[03:10] <DanglyBits> having problems with openssh-server...anyone else having an issue?
[03:10] <compengi> gnomefreak: do you have any good one
[03:10] <hyperstring> dangly not here what's the problem?
[03:11] <gnomefreak> compengi: give me a few minutes im working on something important atm and i will be glad to post one for you :)
[03:11] <chaoslynx> jrib: ok one moment
[03:11] <mmcji> ssh works fine here
[03:11] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: After I upgrade to 6.10, what is the next step to fix my ATI Radeon problem??
[03:11] <DanglyBits> openssh says its started and running via command line but its not
[03:11] <hyperstring> it might be your filre wall dangly blocking port 22
[03:11] <ERIK_LIMA> Download the driver again??
[03:11] <compengi> gnomefreak: so by that time i'll install my nvidia-glx driver :)
[03:11] <hyperstring> firewall
[03:11] <hyperstring> why do you think its not running?
[03:11] <ViennaLi1ux> Hi- i want to dissable root login (ony sudo allowed) - how do revert to this?
[03:11] <gnomefreak> compengi: give me a min working on it now
[03:11] <ERIK_LIMA> Anyone else have the same problem as mine?
[03:11] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: enable the radeon driver in x.org and pray
[03:12] <DanglyBits> tried to ssh in and it wont
[03:12] <marios_s> Hello, I've installed ubuntu and then windows. Now the problem is that I can't dual-boot with windows boot loader. I tried using live ubuntu and then running grub-install but there's no way also after chrooting on the brand-new linux partition. How can I dual boot?
[03:12] <hyperstring> ssh 127.0.0.1 ?
[03:12] <mmcji> port forwarding correctly?
[03:12] <bobbby> it didnt work :(
[03:12] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: if the binary driver didn't work in X 7.0 i don't see why it would work now
[03:12] <DanglyBits> yep
[03:12] <chaoslynx> jrib: damn this folder is full =)
[03:12] <mmcji> ssh -l "userid" ip or dns ?
[03:12] <hyperstring> hmm strange
[03:12] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: but no-one can know for sure with binary blobs
[03:12] <hyperstring> you could try
[03:12] <hyperstring> ssh yourname@servername
[03:12] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: Did you said to edit xorg and pray for work?? :)
[03:13] <hyperstring> otherwise i'd sudo apt-get remove openssh
[03:13] <hyperstring> and then reinstall it
[03:13] <ERIK_LIMA> Hahaha... You seem funny...
[03:13] <jrib> chaoslynx: you can also try creating the /usr/share/spring/mods directory yourself and rerunning it.  Since it seems that was your last error
[03:13] <DanglyBits> ill try
[03:13] <hyperstring> and check i've got no firewalls running
[03:13] <hyperstring> even on the local machine
[03:13] <bobbby> hi i have  a x64 with ati card box, while starting the live session x windows fails to start, how do i solve this?
[03:13] <ERIK_LIMA> I don't know nothing about binary blobs
[03:13] <mmcji> anyone know the repository where i can find OPERA?
[03:13] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: well yeah, enable the "radeon" driver in xorg.conf, wave a dead chicken on your monitor and see if the moon phase is right
[03:13] <bobbby> im doing 6.10
[03:13] <hyperstring> mmcji try sudo apt-cache search opera
[03:13] <hyperstring> that will list the repositories
[03:13] <chaoslynx> jrib: the problem is the basedata removing causes spring/mods to be removed...
[03:13] <mmcji> k, thanks
[03:13] <SlimG> howto restart/start samba daemon from terminal?
[03:14] <ERIK_LIMA> Well, I decide to install Ubuntu Linux for some reasons
[03:14] <rickyfingers_> bobby - I had to flash my bios before I could install 6.10
[03:14] <ViennaLi1ux> SlimG: /etc/init.d/samba restart or something
[03:14] <jrib> chaoslynx: so if you create it, you get back to the postrm error?
[03:14] <ERIK_LIMA> First, I'm studying System Analysis on university
[03:14] <ViennaLi1ux> How to disable root login again (i want only sudo)
[03:14] <SlimG> ViennaLi1ux: thanx :)
[03:14] <chaoslynx> yes
[03:14] <gnomefreak> compengi: http://gnomefreak.pastebin.ca/246658
[03:14] <chaoslynx> thats the problem
[03:14] <ERIK_LIMA> and I'm learning about Operating System, including Unix and Linux
[03:15] <jrib> chaoslynx: k, we can probably edit the postrm script
[03:15] <hyperstring> aha ok its not there
[03:15] <hyperstring> lol
[03:15] <hyperstring> otherwise its http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/
[03:15] <hyperstring> you could use wget to pull it down if you're like us and don't have a graphical interface
[03:15] <ERIK_LIMA> Second: I think it's an absurd to pay cerca US$ to buy an original Windows XP and maintain it up to date
[03:16] <Otacon22> can I use mplayer for seeing TV by a TV card? Actually I use "Tv Zapping" and work good
[03:16] <jrib> chaoslynx: do you know if you had any package that provided that command?  (spring-modupdate)
[03:16] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: well, that's something you can do without accelerated X :)
[03:16] <minimec> ERIK_LIMA: wb! So you are running on edgy now. good. Your ati 9250 card should work on edgy on 3d mode. Verify that you have the 'radeon' driver loaded with xorg and not 'ati' or 'fglrx'.
[03:16] <compengi> gnomefreak: thanks
[03:16] <gnomefreak> yw
[03:16] <mmcji> ha, i should have piped that to a file .lololol
[03:16] <ERIK_LIMA> Third: I hat viruses, Windows XP has lot of viruses, spyware, etc
[03:16] <James> hey i have a question i compiled a .c program and it says a lot of errors but i get an output file of smpd.o  anyideas
[03:16] <bobbby> topyli: how do i set that?
[03:16] <chaoslynx> jrib: i had a package called spring scripts but not spring mod update
[03:17] <Ahmuck> marios_s: qt_parted will do it from with ubuntu or do we need to boot from qt_parted to do it ?
[03:17] <rickyfingers_> James what you got there is an object file
[03:17] <rickyfingers_> it's not an executable
[03:17] <Ahmuck> !qt_parted
[03:17] <James> is it compiled
[03:17] <ubotu> qtparted: A parted frontend using QT. In component main, is optional. Version 0.4.5-2ubuntu11 (edgy), package size 202 kB, installed size 716 kB
[03:17] <ERIK_LIMA> Fourth: With any Linux distribution, I can have good programs without paying a lot for them
[03:17] <chaoslynx> jrib: here is the paste of  /var/lib/dpkg/info/spring-basedata.postrm http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31215/
[03:17] <Clin1> Haas any one got bvidinli's EHCP program to work?
[03:17] <topyli> minimec: i have a 9100 or 9200 at work and i'm running beryl happily with the radeon driver, but i wasn't sure about ERIK_LIMA's 9250
[03:17] <compengi> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31216/ =/
[03:17] <jrib> chaoslynx: and you are certain that the scripts package didn't provide mod-update?
[03:17] <rickyfingers_> james, it's partially compiled
[03:17] <sperry-> how can I disable 60fps cap?
[03:17] <James> RAWR
[03:17] <James> so it wont run
[03:17] <James> thanks mate
[03:17] <ERIK_LIMA> And, if I have problem and a loto of experience with programming language, I can modify it and fix it
[03:17] <chaoslynx> no but if i install scripts than there is another error
[03:18] <chaoslynx> scripts is installed by the way
[03:18] <topyli> bobbby: sorry? how do you set what?
[03:18] <Clin1> bvidinli Is he here?
[03:18] <chaoslynx> jrib: scripts is installed at the moment
[03:18] <jrib> chaoslynx: well you see your postrm?  Just tell it not to run spring-modupdate
[03:18] <gnomefreak> compengi: that looks like a repo issue.
[03:18] <bobbby> topyli: the "xorg,conf" thing
[03:18] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: worry not. If I can't solve my problem alone, I call for my uncle to help :)
[03:18] <bobbby> topyli: the "xorg.conf" thing*
[03:18] <compengi> gnomefreak: so what should i do?
[03:19] <gnomefreak> compengi: can i have the full output please in pastebin
[03:19] <fishsticks> !nvidia
[03:19] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:19] <chaoslynx> jrib: ok i have to delete one line and then run it again and it will work?
[03:19] <Clin1> Has any one ever heard of EHCP?
[03:19] <gnomefreak> jrib: are you on edgy?
[03:19] <compengi> gnomefreak: of the all update?
[03:19] <ERIK_LIMA> My uncle is a system analyser and know things that I don't really know
[03:19] <bjorn_> Skype is telling me there is a problem with sound device. Can anyone help me figure out what that is?
[03:19] <jrib> gnomefreak: yes
[03:19] <topyli> bobbby: ah, just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf with any text editor and change the "ati" driver to "radeon" in the Device section
[03:19] <gnomefreak> compengi: sudo apt-get update all of the output
[03:19] <topyli> bobbby: after making a backup of the file of course :)
[03:19] <sperry-> how can I disable 60fps cap in xgl?
[03:20] <gnomefreak> jrib: can you run apt-get update and see if restricted repo errors out on you
[03:20] <jrib> chaoslynx: maybe, I'm not sure if bash complains about case statements that are empty.  You could just tell it to run 'true', or find out if it matters taht it is empty
[03:20] <nolimitsoya> sperry-, vsync?
[03:20] <Vorbote> 7quit
[03:20] <jrib> gnomefreak: no errors
[03:20] <compengi> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31218/
[03:20] <gnomefreak> compengi: it might be as easy as changing the country code
[03:20] <sperry-> nolimitsoyaq it's not related to sync my refresh rate is 85
[03:20] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: what's your occupation? And where are you from?
[03:20] <gnomefreak> compengi: lets do that. where do you live?
[03:20] <Clin1> oh come on no one has? Or is every one still Pissed off at me from last night
[03:20] <fyrestrtr> bjorn_: are you running the latest skype beta? It solved a lot of the sound issues.
[03:21] <compengi> gnomefreak: lebanon
[03:21] <gnomefreak> is ther ea country code for there?
[03:21] <fyrestrtr> gnomefreak: lb
[03:21] <fatbrain> When I start "info" app I get an info: Symbol 'espeed' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking.   (How do I do that?)
[03:21] <gnomefreak> ty
[03:21] <bjorn_> fyrestrtr: i'm running 1.3.0.53_API
[03:21] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: i'm doing research for a developmental work research center in finland
[03:22] <cornell> Why can't it be easy....
[03:22] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: in practice, i'm trying to figure out commercial free software
[03:22] <gnomefreak> compengi: make your sources look like this deb http://lb.archive.ubuntu........
[03:22] <popel> i have a question: how can i restore the files i moved to trash?
[03:22] <popel> they are in trash but not deletet
[03:22] <gnomefreak> just add the lb. to the repos before archive
[03:22] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: It's a good thing :)
[03:22] <gnomefreak> compengi: if that doesnt work use uk
[03:23] <bobbby> topyli: ok but how in hell i do that, while starting the live session it says the x window colund start and then crashes....
[03:23] <gnomefreak> the uk repos are working fione for me atm
[03:23] <bobbby> topyli:so i juts dont know how to edit that file, its on the cd?
[03:23] <bobbby> topyli: :(
[03:23] <gnomefreak> ty jrib
[03:23] <ERIK_LIMA> Why we can't make this world a better place if we can't teach people how to use a computer using free software
[03:24] <cornell> After installing ubuntu server, do I need to start the services I want, are any started...by default?
[03:24] <topyli> bobbby: ah a live cd. no, you don't edit those :)
[03:24] <fyrestrtr> cornell: ssh is not installed by default, you probably want that :)
[03:24] <CokeNCode> hey , how do i find out my processor speed in ubuntu
[03:24] <jrib> CokeNCode: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[03:24] <bobbby> topyli: :S
[03:24] <gnomefreak> cat /proc/cpuinfo
[03:24] <LjL> topyli: sure? i was under the impression the CD is mounted with a unionfs or something
[03:24] <CokeNCode> i thought it'd show up in 'system monitor'
[03:24] <CokeNCode> thanks jrib
[03:24] <ERIK_LIMA> I plan to found an NGO to teach people without resources to learn about computers how to use it
[03:24] <popel> i moved 19.6GB mp3-files to trash which were organized in folders... now there are all in trash without folders, only files. the folders are empty, but the files are in trash. how can i restore them?
[03:25] <gnomefreak> brb
[03:25] <nolimitsoya> LjL, its a squashfs
[03:25] <nolimitsoya> and therefore editable; edits go into ram
[03:25] <topyli> bobbby: listen to LjL, he seems to have a better idea
[03:25] <mmcji> i have searched via apt-cache search opera and do not see opera anywhere.  anyone know what repository i can fine OPERA in?
[03:25] <ERIK_LIMA> Ubuntu has a beautiful philosophy
[03:25] <Khale1> I've got ubuntu drapper running on my machine but it's busted for some reason so I'd like to reinstall everything one more time. No CD on the machine (it's a toshiba r100) however I have an external cd player, but the live disc doesn't work, anyone know how to install ubuntu over the internet only? I've seen the stuff about netboot but it seems you need another machine running linux to do this? Is there a net way?
[03:25] <ERIK_LIMA> "Linux for being humans"
[03:25] <fyrestrtr> !opera
[03:25] <ubotu> opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[03:25] <LjL> popel, i'm not KDE, but my guess is right click on the trash, and "Restore", or something close. just replying you since nobody else has...
[03:26] <ERIK_LIMA> Guys... what's your ages?? I'm 22 years old
[03:26] <topyli> bobbby: if he's right you can edit the file like it's a real one. use nano as your editor if you have no X
[03:26] <Khale1> 27
[03:26] <nolimitsoya> !offtopic | ERIK_LIMA
[03:26] <ubotu> ERIK_LIMA: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[03:26] <ubuntu_> yo
[03:26] <LjL> topyli, i don't have an idea, i'm just saying i think the FS *can* be modified even on the CD...
[03:26] <fyrestrtr> !installation > Khale1
[03:26] <popel> LjL: there is no "restore"
[03:26] <ubuntu_> sorry
[03:26] <cornell> fyrestrtr: it seems that http isn't either
[03:26] <popel> LjL: I'm using gnome
[03:26] <ERIK_LIMA> Ubotu: sorry... I didn't know
[03:26] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sorry... I didn't know - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:26] <minimec> Khale1: first. Is your whole system corrupt or is it just a xorg question? Can you use the console?
[03:26] <cornell> fyrestrtr: Is anything started?
[03:26] <topyli> LjL: quite enough, just what we need to know :)
[03:26] <nolimitsoya> popel, if you open the trashcan and rightclick on the deleted files, there is no restore option?
[03:26] <fyrestrtr> cornell: if you install just the server, then no. If you install LAMP, then http is there.
[03:27] <ubuntu_> oh shit
[03:27] <Khale1> well I can use things, however sudo just doesn't want to work
[03:27] <Khale1> I've tried several things to sort this out
[03:27] <fyrestrtr> cornell: cron and other basic services, nothing exotic.
[03:27] <Khale1> but the problem remains
[03:27] <qubix__> anyone here run Nepenthes or know anything about it????
[03:27] <popel> nolimitsoya: no. there isn't
[03:27] <Khale1> beryl is completely borked as well
[03:27] <cornell> fyrestrtr: is install LAMP a superset of install to hard drive, or subset?
[03:27] <bjorn_> SKype is telling me there's a problem with my sound device, I think it might have something to do with me using OSS as my sound device. Alsa couldn't get my microphone working. Anyone know where I should start to solve this mystery?
[03:27] <popel> i can delete them
[03:27] <Khale1> and my pccma cd doesn't work either
[03:27] <nolimitsoya> popel, then use xfce, kde or any other proper wm ;)
[03:27] <sc0tty> f*ck , my ubuntu won't boot now :@
[03:27] <minimec> Khale1: So you can use your system but you cannot do any administration things?
[03:27] <virago> join ubuntu-cz
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> !language | sc0tt
[03:28] <ubotu> sc0tt: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:28] <LjL> popel, some googling seems to tell me that on Gnome you must move files away from the trash manually - but that might be wrong or outdated
[03:28] <fyrestrtr> cornell: lamp is an option to install server + the lamp stack. its only available on the dapper server install image.
[03:28] <bobbby> topyli: ok, but still dont know how to do it
[03:28] <nolimitsoya> !language | sc0tty
[03:28] <ubotu> sc0tty: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[03:28] <popel> KDE can restore?
[03:28] <fyrestrtr> cornell: does that help?
[03:28] <Khale1> that's exactly it, as it's got two cards (wifi and normal) it's decided not to use my normal card for internet access as well
[03:28] <patientfox> hi i accidently aborted in the middle of installing some packages from the commandline... now apt-get errors out with E: Broken Packages preceeded by a list of deps for the package i want to installl.... is there a way to "clean the system" up? thanks
[03:28] <kuja_> Is there anyone here running Ubuntu off an external harddrive (USB2.0)?
[03:28] <patientfox> like using dpkg or something
[03:29] <popel> LjL: hmmm i think thats right. I think there is no other way.
[03:29] <fyrestrtr> patientfox: you could reinstall it.
[03:29] <LjL> popel: yes, i right click on a file in the trash, and there is a "Restore" menu entry
[03:29] <patientfox> fyrestrtr: how?
[03:29] <popel> sorting 19.6GB mp3 is hard
[03:29] <Khale1> I installed ubuntu using something called instlux which deletes windows and installs ubuntu via the internet
[03:29] <topyli> bobbby: "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf". but i don't know how much it will help on a live system
[03:29] <bobbby> Hey anyone know how to start the live session if your box have a ati card?
[03:29] <Khale1> downloads all the packages there and then and it's a text based installation process
[03:29] <minimec> Khale1: So gksudo synaptic gives you an error?
[03:29] <fyrestrtr> patientfox: sudo apt-get install --reinstall somepackage
[03:29] <Poromenos> a package requires python2.3 so i can't install it, is there any way to skip this dependency and see if it'll work?
[03:29] <topyli> bobbby: might be better to run the "vesa" driver as it's supposed to always work
[03:30] <Khale1> yup it just doesn't let me do anything
[03:30] <kuja_> popel: First, everytime you rip your music (assuming this is how you get MP3's, cause you're a legitimate guy and you already own the CD), make sure you edit the ID3 tags so they're somewhat organized :)
[03:30] <Khale1> when I tried to reinstall sudo (an older version) from the recovery install it didn't go through with it
[03:30] <sc0tty> :( I get asked for my root passwd (cant' check some volumes) but I never get a prompt after giving my passwd :(
[03:30] <minimec> Khale1: ... and sudo synaptic on a console either...?
[03:30] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: we don't support installation methods not mentioned at ubuntu.com or the official wiki.
[03:30] <kuja_> Poromenos: Can't it use a version greater than 2.3?
[03:30] <kuja_> Such as 2.4
[03:30] <bobbby> topyli: how do i run the "vesa" driver :S:S::S
[03:31] <Poromenos> kuja_: probably, but it stops in installation
[03:31] <cornell> fyrestrtr: so install LAMP option is install Hard drive plus LAMP, so anything installed with install to hard drive is also installed with install LAMP.
[03:31] <fyrestrtr> !root | sc0tty
[03:31] <ubotu> sc0tty: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[03:31] <kuja_> Poromenos: What package?
[03:31] <Poromenos> because it's a virtual package or something
[03:31] <Poromenos> python2.3
[03:31] <fyrestrtr> cornell: yes.
[03:31] <Poromenos> oh, snakebite
[03:31] <sc0tty> fyrestrtr: I know what root is
[03:31] <patientfox> fyrestrtr: when i put in the package names of the packages it says there is no installation candidate
[03:31] <gnomefreak> compengi: did that do it?
[03:31] <fyrestrtr> cornell: the 'server' install is the very basic, everything else is a superset of that.
[03:31] <topyli> bobbby: edit the file, find the Device section and change the lilne that says "Driver = "ati"" or similar to say "vesa"
[03:31] <SlimG> what's the command that checks for errors in linux config files?
[03:31] <mmcji> ok, Opera is avail in .deb binary from Opera, not repository for 6.10 that I can find....
[03:31] <LjL> sc0tty: read that page, there is a reason why you were pointed to it, and it's *not* that you don't know what root is
[03:31] <kuja_> Poromenos: It's not in the Ubuntu repository. Where did you get this package from?
[03:31] <sc0tty> I rebooted after upgrading and now I can't log in
[03:32] <Khale1> fyrestrt, thats cool, I'm just trying to see if there is a way to install using the internet (where the installation process happens as the installation is progressing)
[03:32] <Poromenos> kuja_: http://actlab.tv/snakebite.html
[03:32] <mmcji> everyone have a wonderful day!
[03:32] <topyli> bobbby: then do "startx" and see whether it starts or blows up :)
[03:32] <fyrestrtr> !installation | Khale1
[03:32] <ubotu> Khale1: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
=== cybernout is now known as unimatrix9
[03:32] <minimec> Khale1: what account are you using. Ubuntu gives sudo rights to the first user installed during the ubuntu installation. I f you login as another user, you will not have sudo rights.
[03:32] <topyli> i wouldn't fix a live system anyway, life's too short on them
[03:33] <Khale1> minimec I've checked that my username is in the admin group which it is
[03:33] <popel> kuja_: I lost some CDs and the problem is that the mp3s without ID3-Tag are ropped from the CDs i lost... ;)
[03:33] <Poromenos> popel: what are you trying to do?
[03:33] <popel> cya, I'm sorting my mp3s
[03:33] <kuja_> popel: :)
[03:33] <kuja_> popel: FYI
[03:33] <Poromenos> popel: www.musicbrainz.org
[03:33] <kuja_> popel: ExFalso is excellent for editing tags.
[03:33] <fyrestrtr> popel: just use some player that has a gracenote plugin (most do) and it will edit the tags for you. There are tons of tag editing utils in the repos.
[03:33] <kuja_> It has mass renaming and all.
[03:34] <kuja_> sudo apt-get install exfalso
[03:34] <Khale1> I'm going to try sudo synaptic because I haven't tried that out yet
[03:34] <bobbby> topyli: mmm.. but in the live cd theres i sno console so i can do that, the just a "boot options" line and no more, afeter that just crashed cuz the x
[03:34] <Poromenos> so, how do i install packages despite unmet dependencies?
[03:34] <Khale1> minimec thanks for the help btw, it's much appreicated
[03:34] <cornell> Thanks fyrestrtr
[03:34] <LjL> Khale1, if you haven't set a root password manually (which is not recommended), you should never be asked for a root password, but just for your own user's password. what is asking this password anyway?
[03:34] <sc0tty> I get the classic maintenance issue prompt : Ctrl-D de continue or give root passwd for maintenance. I give my root passwd, and the login starts, it just seems to hang after that ...
[03:35] <Khale1> I know, that's exactly why I think that sudo is bused
[03:35] <Khale1> busted even
[03:35] <topyli> bobbby: maybe there are more consoles if you press ctrl-alt-F2
[03:35] <minimec> Khale1: try the sudo synaptic command... No problem for the help. I don't think that you have to do a new clean install ...
[03:35] <fyrestrtr> Poromenos: etiher you find another package (a updated one), you compile by hand, or there is a way (iirc) to 'inject' packages so that they are installed -- but only to be tried by those that like broken systems.
[03:35] <kuja_> Poromenos: First you want to see what all packages this one depends on.
[03:35] <popel> fyrestrtr: can you name a player?
[03:35] <Khale1> I really hope not :)
[03:35] <kuja_> fyrestrtr: The software seems to only be distributed as des.
[03:35] <Poromenos> kuja_: well, python2.3 and bittorrent
[03:35] <kuja_> debs*
[03:35] <Ahmuck> 0nos0retep0
[03:35] <kuja_> So he'll need to extract the archive.
[03:35] <LjL> Khale1, but where are you being asked for the password? while using "sudo something", or what?
[03:35] <a7p> part
[03:35] <kuja_> Either extract and rebuilt, or just copy the files.
[03:35] <fyrestrtr> popel: exfalso, exile! and amarok come to mind.
[03:36] <Khale1> ljl yeah when I open synaptic manager
[03:36] <Poromenos> isn't there some flag i can pass to dpkg so it'll ignore the dependency?
[03:36] <popel> thank you
[03:36] <Khale1> or any sudo
[03:36] <popel> cya
[03:36] <Khale1> apparently it's the wrong password
[03:36] <kuja_> Poromenos: I think..
[03:36] <topyli> fyrestrtr: exfalso is a tag editor :)
[03:36] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: what group is your user in?
[03:36] <bobbby> topyli. weel ill try,brb
[03:36] <SlimG> what's the command that checks for errors in linux config files?
[03:36] <Khale1> in admin
[03:36] <LjL> Khale1, so when you type "sudo true" what is output exactly?
[03:37] <kuja_> Poromenos: dpkg -i --ignore-depends=python2.3 snakebite-rc3.deb
[03:37] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: in admin only ?
[03:37] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: Ah... one more question...
[03:37] <Poromenos> kuja_: ah, that worked, thanks!
[03:37] <kuja_> Poromenos: Does dpkg complain though?
[03:37] <minimec> Khale1: What you can do is to start ubuntu in recovery mode. Then your system will stop booting on the console, logging in as 'root'. Yes, as 'root'. There you should be able to do all administration tasks. You can even give 'root' a password doing 'passwd' without sudo ;)
[03:37] <ERIK_LIMA> When I'm running games made with Flash, they run slow than with Windows XP
[03:37] <Khale1> fyrestrtr I'm not sure...actually, ljl I can't seem to get the output for sudo true
[03:38] <Poromenos> no... snakebite complains that it can't find /usr/bin/python2.3
[03:38] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: do what minimec said.
[03:38] <ERIK_LIMA> Do you think this problem is caused by a bad video hardware acceleration??
[03:38] <Poromenos> but i'll just symlink that or edit the file or something
[03:38] <LjL> Khale1: well, it will *not* give you an output if it's working... but then if sudo isn't working, it should ask you for a password or something
[03:38] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: they do. they also use 100% cpu time
[03:38] <fyrestrtr> Poromenos: you could try symlinking it to python2.4
[03:38] <kuja_> Poromenos: Right. sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.3
[03:38] <kuja_> I wish Ubuntu would support Ruby :(
[03:38] <LjL> Khale1: try "sudo uname", do you get output?
[03:38] <kuja_> Then I'd write some nifty tools :)
[03:39] <Khale1> ljl yeah it asks me for the password three times and I'm out :)
[03:39] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: it's the wonderful world of flash on linux
[03:39] <fyrestrtr> kuja_: you can still write them :)
[03:39] <kuja_> And actually make an effort to join the Ubuntu team and get Ruby packages shipped standardly.
[03:39] <Poromenos> hmm, i'll try stuff, i know what to do from here on. thanks for the help guys
[03:39] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: what password are you typing in?
[03:39] <Khale1> well I've just logged into recovery mode command line
[03:39] <kuja_> fyrestrtr: Sure, but nothing standard to the point where it because distributed with Ubuntu :)
[03:39] <Khale1> my username password
[03:39] <kuja_> Poromenos: Good luck =)
[03:39] <Khale1> ok I'm in recovery mode
[03:39] <Poromenos> thanks :)
[03:39] <Khale1> command line
[03:39] <fyrestrtr> kuja_: I'm sure if you write some killer tools, you will get them in.
[03:39] <ERIK_LIMA> I hope with Edgy I could fix it...
[03:39] <Khale1> what do you guys think I should do to try and solve this ?
[03:40] <kuja_> fyrestrtr: Bringing an interpreted language standard with the distribution takes a lot of effort :(
[03:40] <kuja_> So far I only know of Python and Perl
[03:40] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: adobe has just released flash 9 for linux which is a bit better but it still has that nice flash feeling
[03:40] <fyrestrtr> you don't like python?
[03:40] <Poromenos> by the way, does anyone know a good short tutorial for ruby?
[03:40] <kuja_> The KDE community is big on Ruby though, I like GNOME better though.
[03:40] <minimec> Khale1: Do you had to login in recovery mode?
[03:40] <LjL> Khale1: i think you should disable the root password, if there's any set ("passwd -l root"), then make very sure that 1) your user is in the "admin" group  2) the "admin" group is mentioned in the /etc/sudoers file
[03:40] <kuja_> Poromenos: Short? Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby
[03:40] <Khale1> how do I go into my GUI from recovery mode? (I've been using ubuntu for 5 months now but tried to stay away from the text line modes as much as possible)
[03:40] <marios_s> Hello, I'm trying to use the kubuntu live boot loader. I've a kubuntu installed on /dev/hda. what's the command to boot? root=/dev/hda3 (linux part) doesn't work
[03:41] <Poromenos> kuja_: that's a book :p
[03:41] <kuja_> fyrestrtr: I like it.  But I like Ruby more.
[03:41] <kuja_> Poromenos: There's no universal rule stating that books cannot be guides.
[03:41] <djbryy> LjL, are you there? it is DJBRYY!
[03:41] <minimec> Khale1: just do 'exit' ;)
[03:41] <kuja_> In fact, it's almost implicit that books are guides.
[03:41] <fyrestrtr> kuja_: okay :)
[03:41] <Poromenos> kuja_: but there is a universal rule that states that books aren't short :p
[03:41] <fyrestrtr> guides are people :P
[03:41] <kuja_> Poromenos: No there isn't.
[03:41] <LjL> djbryy, i just finished typing a message, so i guess i'm here :)
[03:41] <Khale1> ah right okey dokey :)
[03:41] <Poromenos> there is now!
[03:41] <TGPO> mornin djbryy, still working that boot problem?
[03:42] <kuja_> Poromenos: =)
[03:42] <djbryy> TGPO, yes how did you know?>
[03:42] <dsoft> hiya
[03:42] <ERIK_LIMA> topyli: Flash Player 9?? Where can I get it??
[03:42] <kuja_> Poromenos: Compared to some "bibles" I've seen, Why's guide is very, very short :)
[03:42] <warkruid> dsoft: hello
[03:42] <Khale1> ah but then it asks me to give username and password
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> !flash9
[03:42] <ubotu> Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[03:42] <TGPO> djbryy, I was listening to all of it last night, havent seen LjL yet this morning
[03:42] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: from adobe :)
[03:42] <djbryy> LjL, thanks man, : ) so i have a new frame of mind i am gonna do everything you guys say to me this morning ty.
[03:42] <ERIK_LIMA> toypli: Well, when I try to play "Bike Mania" on flashgames247.com, it's slow
[03:42] <dsoft> sorry, im a bit noob, how can i set permissions for an user (actualy only root have access) for a full tree of files? (recursive)
[03:42] <djbryy> TGPO, he is on.
[03:42] <nolimitsoya> !flash9 > ERIK_LIMA
[03:43] <Poromenos> kuja_: i was thinking of something more like this: http://www.poromenos.org/tutorials/python :P
[03:43] <TGPO> djbryy, just saw that
[03:43] <bjorn_> If I try testing the alsa device in gstreamer I get an error saying it can't open it for writing. I've posted the full error message in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31221/    Maybe somebody could take a look?
[03:43] <kuja_> Poromenos: Though, if you wanted to get started (or rather, memorize basics) real quick, you could check out zenspider's "QuickRef", just google for "zenspider quickref"
[03:43] <compengi> gnomefreak: trying the uk.archieve.ubuntu =/
[03:43] <djbryy> TGPO, haha
[03:43] <Khale1> so logging in with my username and password defeats the object no? if I type in root and then my password I don't get in either :)
[03:43] <nolimitsoya> dsoft, chmod -p
[03:43] <LjL> djbryy, problem is that i really don't know what you could try. did you paste that screenshot somewhere, after i logged off yesterday?
[03:43] <kuja_> It's simple a compiled references of essential Ruby stuff.
[03:43] <nolimitsoya> dsoft,sorry  chmod -R
[03:43] <fyrestrtr> Khale1: do you know how sudo works?
[03:43] <djbryy> LjL, nope I can do it thismorning if you like
[03:43] <Poromenos> kuja_: ah, that's better, but too "referency"
[03:43] <ERIK_LIMA> I don't know what version of Flash Player I have...
[03:43] <Poromenos> i shall google
[03:44] <Khale1> yes I do, unfortunately it's not doing what it's meant to be doing which is why I'm trying to go through a completely different route here
[03:44] <alyssum> well, i fixed my font problems by uninstalling all the arphic chinese fonts.  just thought i'd share my solution, in case anyone was listening in.
[03:44] <Diiba> Hi, just compiled custom kernel to ppc based xubuntu box and got this error on boot: udevplug[1034] make_queue:unable to create /dev/.udev/queue: No such file or directory.
[03:44] <fyrestrtr> dsoft: chown -R user:group /some/directory
[03:44] <djbryy> LjL, what is the Terminal code to launch the program again?
[03:44] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: type "about:plugins" into your browser's address entry box
[03:44] <LjL> djbryy: yes do it, just so i can confirm what i think the situation is. a site where you could post it is http://imageshack.us/  (make sure you select "optimize without resizing")
[03:44] <aimtrainer> hi! Does anybody have experience with edgy and the ipw3945? I tried it with this script but t just won work :(
[03:44] <LjL> djbryy: "gparted"
[03:44] <aimtrainer> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=140085&page=2&highlight=ipw3945
[03:44] <alyssum> however, i still got a lot of questions on the fonts.conf file after all this trouble.  my post is on http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297621
[03:44] <LjL> djbryy: or "gksudo gparted" if that fails
[03:45] <dsoft> chown or chmod?
[03:45] <ERIK_LIMA> Hum... it's Shockwave Flash version 7
[03:45] <fyrestrtr> dsoft: chown = change owner chmod = change mode (permissions)
[03:45] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell dsoft about permissions
[03:45] <minimec> Khale1: Hmmm ... When you start in recovery mode, you don't have to login normally. Ubuntu should stop on a normal console without login prompt. Only if you activated user 'root' the system will ask you the login information.
[03:45] <djbryy> LjL, ok i have it and the screenshot i am uploading now.
[03:46] <fyrestrtr> minimec: he didn't install ubuntu using the cds, but via some third party tool (that I haven't heard of)
[03:46] <LjL> djbryy, good, give me the URL when it's up
[03:46] <Diiba> Does anyone have ANY info?
[03:46] <Diiba> Hi, just compiled custom kernel to ppc based xubuntu box and got this error on boot: udevplug[1034] make_queue:unable to create /dev/.udev/queue: No such file or directory.
[03:46] <Diiba> Ty?
[03:46] <Diiba> Should i just make the file? Even with root permissions I cant keep the file there.
[03:46] <fyrestrtr> Diiba: how did you compile the kernel?
[03:47] <Diiba> Well
[03:47] <minimec> fyrestrtr: So I guess that this tool activated user 'root' ;) ... and he doesn't know the login infos... Not so good ;)
=== kuja_ is now known as kuja
[03:47] <LjL> Diiba, the file won't stay there because /dev mounts a virtual filesystem, i think
[03:47] <topyli> Diiba: the "files" in /dev are generated at boot, you don't make them
[03:47] <Diiba> Ok.
[03:47] <Khale1> ah, so maybe that's the problem? how do I deactive the root?
[03:47] <fyrestrtr> minimec: yes, this is what I suspect.
[03:47] <djbryy> LjL, what do i use for the URL there are like 60r7
[03:47] <Diiba> So does anyone know how to solve my problem?
[03:47] <superkirbyartist> There's Abiword, Gnumeric, and what for slideshows?
[03:47] <dsoft> thx
[03:47] <LjL> Khale1, perhaps https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword can be of help
[03:47] <fyrestrtr> Diiba: I think you forgot to include proper udev support.
[03:47] <djbryy> LjL, sorry 6 or 7
[03:47] <kuja> superkirbyartist: OpenOffice
[03:48] <Diiba> Oh my.
[03:48] <LjL> djbryy: well, give me one that shows the screenshot at full size...
[03:48] <Diiba> This is going to take forever.
[03:48] <zergio> hola
[03:48] <superkirbyartist> No fox Xubuntu.
[03:48] <minimec> Khale1: only 'root' and the 'sudoer' can do that...
[03:48] <fyrestrtr> !kernel | Diiba
[03:48] <ubotu> Diiba: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[03:48] <topyli> superkirbyartist: no real alternative
[03:48] <dsoft> but, there is any file manager that really have recursive mode? nautilus dont let me

[03:48] <djbryy> LjL, ok here it is, http://img241.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotje6.png
[03:48] <superkirbyartist> So just get OpenOffice?  Will it run well on Pentium MMX 266mhz 2GB HD 192MB RAM?

[03:49] <superkirbyartist> And why does Ubuntu have an old Gaim?
[03:49] <fyrestrtr> dsoft: ctrl+a will highlight all files
[03:49] <djbryy> superkirbyartist, no it probrably wont man ...
[03:49] <warkruid> dsoft: missed the discussion. Why a recursive mode?
[03:49] <superkirbyartist> Why not?
[03:49] <LjL> djbryy: argh, that's totally different from what you described >: the two colored bars don't take up the whole space, there is a huge gray bar at the beginning, and the box on the top right does not say 50Gb
[03:49] <topyli> superkirbyartist: it won't run well on anytihing but if you want a powerpoint replacement, it's your best bet
[03:49] <Diiba> Btw, it took 3h + to compile it with imac g3 (400mhz)

[03:49] <fyrestrtr> superkirbyartist: there is another application you can try....
[03:49] <djbryy> LjL, sorry... I was confused and tired yesterday...
[03:49] <dsoft> i want to change the permisions of all of my directory tree (actualy root) for user DsOft
[03:49] <superkirbyartist> Which one?
[03:50] <fyrestrtr> dsoft: change them to what?
[03:50] <LjL> djbryy, i guess that what shows up as "unallocated" is really your Windows partition... except it's not recognized anymore
[03:50] <dsoft> so i can access with user:dsoft
[03:50] <dsoft> and not only root
[03:50] <djbryy> LjL, so that means... re-install windows right>
[03:50] <superkirbyartist> fyrestrtr: what app?
[03:50] <djbryy> ????
[03:50] <zergio> no encuentro unas aplicaciones en los menus, por ejemplo el gestor de usuarios y grupos ya no esta en en sistema-administracion
[03:50] <ERIK_LIMA> Ah... what's the better video card for Ubuntu? Nvidia or ATI???
[03:50] <LjL> djbryy, we could try and reset it, but i cannot guarantee you anything - actually we might end up with both a broken Windows *and* a broken Ubuntu
[03:50] <warkruid> dsoft: don't think thats wise. some directories should only be accesible to root.
[03:50] <gnomefreak> zergio: /join #ubuntu-es please
[03:51] <TGPO> ERIK_LIMA, nvidia
[03:51] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm planning to buy a Nvidia if I could not solve my problem with ATI driver
[03:51] <djbryy> LjL, relly??!? haha. OK how do we "reset"?
[03:51] <topyli> ERIK_LIMA: an old card
=== b33r is now known as b33r-
[03:51] <dsoft> i mean, my own folders, not system ones, (movies music etc....)
[03:51] <kuja> Generally nVidia cards are better supported, I think.
[03:51] <compengi> hey b33r- sahil nom :D
[03:51] <djbryy> TGPO, so did you come up with any solutions to my problem from yesterday?
[03:51] <ERIK_LIMA> I read the installation instructions on Nvidia site and I thinked it's easiest than the ATI
[03:51] <LjL> djbryy, well, it involves using fdisk and recreating the partition information. TGPO, or anybody who knows about the issue from yesterday, any better idea?
[03:52] <dsoft> i was as root user, when i copy them, so i cant access now as simple user
[03:52] <superkirbyartist> Excuse me what is the app fyrestrtr?
[03:52] <warkruid> dsoft: sudo chmod -R <user>:<group> <directory>
[03:52] <djbryy> LjL, hahah I just asked that..
[03:52] <LjL> !firestarter | superkirbyartist
[03:52] <ubotu> superkirbyartist: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[03:52] <ERIK_LIMA> And I think I could buy a Nvida Geoforce with a price I could pay :)
[03:52] <gnomefreak> ERIK_LIMA: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx is even easier than you run one more command and poof it works (normally)
[03:52] <warkruid> dsoft: oops.. chmod and chown mixed up
[03:52] <dark2y> hi
[03:52] <dsoft> oki
[03:52] <superkirbyartist> So who cares?  I want a PowerPoint software?
[03:52] <kuja> ERIK_LIMA: The Older 256's are pretty affordable nowadays
[03:52] <dark2y> can someone help me pls
[03:52] <dark2y> :D
[03:53] <TGPO> LjL, djbryy the only thing I can think of is prolly what LjL is thinking, use the windows CD to restore the MBR and then try to rescue the Ubuntu installation with the live CD
[03:53] <djbryy> dark2y, ok what do u need?
[03:53] <superkirbyartist> kuja:286
[03:53] <LjL> superkirbyartist: i don't know. try OpenOffice Impress for that perhaps
[03:53] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell superkirbyartist about alternatives
[03:53] <kuja> superkirbyartist: $199 where I work
[03:53] <superkirbyartist> But will it run on my pentium?
[03:53] <dark2y> i'v got the last relese of ubuntu from your site
[03:53] <fyrestrtr> superkirbyartist: KeyJnote might be worth a shot.
[03:53] <compengi> gnomefreak: why do you think it's doing this, i'm now updating from uk.archieve
[03:53] <djbryy> TGPO, one problem I do not have the windows CD available here.
[03:53] <dark2y> and.. after install
[03:53] <LjL> superkirbyartist, disregard the first message, i mixed up "alternatives" and "equivalents"
[03:53] <dark2y> i boot up in linux.. and it just stops on fsck
[03:53] <olspookishmagus> which is the c++ compiler package on ununtu?
[03:54] <superkirbyartist> Okay, well what does KeyJnote do?
[03:54] <dsoft> puff
[03:54] <fyrestrtr> olspookishmagus: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[03:54] <dsoft> i donno what group and user exactly
[03:54] <minimec> re MY opera software crashed ;)
[03:54] <topyli> olspookishmagus: gcc
[03:54] <warkruid> olspookismagus: g++
[03:54] <TGPO> djbryy, ouch
[03:54] <dsoft> bad first linux day!
[03:54] <dark2y> and it stays like this until i restart..
[03:54] <ERIK_LIMA> When I bought my computer this year, I insisted to developers to include a Nvidia instead of aTI, but...
[03:54] <olspookishmagus> thank you all
[03:54] <fyrestrtr> superkirbyartist: it makes really good sandwiches (what do you think? its a presentation viewer :P)
[03:54] <djbryy> TGPO, yes. SO what do i do?
[03:54] <alecjw> olspookishmagus: then, you need to run g++ -o <output binsry file name> <input source code>
[03:54] <gnomefreak> compengi: not sure but its sounding like a server issue. i hate to say this as it sounds so winodws but also try rebooting (it fixed mine back when i had the issue) after playing with my router and modem settings
[03:55] <trukosh> anybody who knows a time registration software for gnome?
[03:55] <superkirbyartist> sudo apt-get remove your-mom-core
[03:55] <ERIK_LIMA> But they refuse to install it because they said that they dont't have a nvidia card with 128 MB fo RAM
[03:55] <LjL> TGPO, actually that's not what i was thinking... even if you restore the MBR, the Windows partition still isn't there - or at least, neither gparter nor sfdisk seem to see it. so actually what i was thinking is: open fdisk, tell it to create a FAT32 (or NTFS, and hope he knows which is the right one) partition that starts at the beginning of the disk and ends just before the ubuntu partition, and then hope (well, and then yes, recreate the MBR if
[03:55] <LjL> necessary, but perhaps Grub will even just boot it at that point)
[03:55] <superkirbyartist> Thank you fyrestrtr.
[03:55] <compengi> gnomefreak: i've just installed edgy on a clean hdd =/
[03:55] <WhoWho> hi
[03:55] <dark2y> so can you help me?
[03:55] <sc0tty> dark2y: I have a similar problem
[03:55] <yu5e> i've been waiting for what must be about an hour for everything to load after i chose Start or install ubuntu on my thinkpad
[03:55] <yu5e> any ideas ??
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> trukosh: 'ntpdate' ?
[03:55] <dark2y> i have sata and windows vista instaled
[03:55] <LjL> TGPO, of course though, if the partition table is already corrupted, modifying it could corrupt it further, which would mean neither Ubuntu nor Windows would start
[03:55] <dark2y> on other partitions
[03:55] <superkirbyartist> Speaking of partitions, how do you defragment?
[03:56] <fyrestrtr> yu5e: how old is your thinkpad?
[03:56] <kuja> yu5e: That's how long it takes for me when I'm running from QEMU :)
[03:56] <sc0tty> I can't boot, I managed to run an fsck , but it seems the boot image 6.10 wrote is not good ...
[03:56] <dark2y> i'v got a similar problem on 6.6 but i coud ctrl + c
[03:56] <djbryy> LjL, I read your msg to TGPO, good i dea r we gonna try it?
[03:56] <dark2y> over it
[03:56] <TGPO> LjL, yup, this is a case of damned if you do damned if you dont
[03:56] <LjL> superkirbyartist: you don't. but on the bright side, ext3 suffers from fragmentation much less than FAT and NTFS do
[03:56] <WhoWho> I want to ask about something I feel it is not normal.. when I access users&groups from System>Administration   it does not ask me for password!!
[03:56] <fyrestrtr> superkirbyartist: linux file systems do not require defragmentation.
[03:56] <WhoWho> I want to ask about something I feel it is not normal.. when I access users&groups from System>Administration   it does not ask me for password!! is this normal?
[03:56] <superkirbyartist> Linux uses ext3?
[03:56] <LjL> superkirbyartist: not necessarily, but Ubuntu does by default
[03:56] <TGPO> superkirbyartist, by default yes
[03:56] <trukosh> Kingsqueak, no, i mean sth to register working hours - sry my english is really bad..
[03:56] <fyrestrtr> WhoWho: system caches sudo logins.
[03:57] <yu5e> fyrestrtr: very old, why?
[03:57] <superkirbyartist> Well that's good, thank you!
[03:57] <WhoWho> well i didnt do any sudo
[03:57] <kuja> yu5e: Then you don't want to be doing that
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> trukosh: oh o.k., sorry, not sure
[03:57] <fyrestrtr> yu5e: could be that you don't meet the minimum requirements.
[03:57] <yu5e> clearly not
[03:57] <LjL> djbryy: if you don't mind, yes. do keep in mind that it's a keep-your-fingers-crossed thing more than anything else
[03:57] <WhoWho> besides.. at the same time when i access synaptic  it asks for pass
[03:57] <LjL> djbryy: hold on a minute though, i need a cigarette right now =)
[03:57] <yu5e> :( it did run windows xp quite fast
[03:57] <kuja> yu5e: You might want to try doing a basic command line install using the "Alternate" CD and then installing Xubuntu.
[03:57] <djbryy> LjL, ok then so what do i have to type in terminal if anything?
[03:57] <TGPO> LjL, good idea
[03:58] <dark2y> ok.. pls how can i skip over fsck ???

[04:01] <djbryy> LjL, how do i do that?
[04:01] <kuja> ubuntu_newb: What kind of problems?
[04:02] <yu5e> ok my thinkpad does meet the minimum requirements, is there something else that could be causing this? it runs xp fine
[04:02] <dark2y> how can i skip over fsck???
[04:02] <ubuntu_newb> I wouldn't remove the server
[04:02] <phichipsi> hi folks, i bought a maxtor external hd which is mounted on ntfs per default, which i cant write to using dapper. how could i make it writable? can i try to format it with fat?
[04:02] <dark2y> pleas somone has got to know..
[04:02] <ubuntu_newb> it said it removed the package with the sudo apt-get remove
[04:02] <WhoWho> i will report this now, hoping to be my contribution in "Humanity" :P
[04:02] <ubuntu_newb> I think that was the command
[04:02] <fyrestrtr> yu5e: you should try the alternate install cd.
[04:02] <ubuntu_newb> but anyway, it didn't actually remove the server so I installed 6.10 but now I don't want to ruin this install
[04:02] <cornell> I don't seem to have sshd installed with ubuntu server, I usually use synaptic, I don't see in apt-get man how to get a list of packages.  How do I do that, or what's the package to apt-get?
[04:02] <c_lisp> hmmm I don't get that pradeep

[04:03] <Kingsqueak> trukosh: ohhh, yeah there are some of those, let me see if I can find one
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> trukosh: try gtimer
[04:04] <timbobsteve> does anyone know if sysv-rc-conf has become obsolete because of upstart? I was looking to kill some unneeded services to decrease startup time, but read that edgy uses Upstart, no sysv-init

[04:07] <dark2y> lol.. how can i skip fsck???
[04:07] <compengi> gnomefreak: i'm upgrading now and going to install nvidia-glx but i'm afraid that i'll mess it up can you guide me through please?
[04:08] <nolimitsoya> phichipsi, you can always format a drive, bur never mount it as a diffrent filesystem than it is, and never format without loosing all your data
[04:08] <pazemlsqdfmoj> quite annoying, my update manager doesnt work anymore :|
[04:08] <topyli> c_lisp: i put beryl on my dapper laptop. it doesn't work perfectly at all but it didn't break the system either
[04:08] <pazemlsqdfmoj> it just shows a grey screen
[04:08] <gnomefreak> compengi: if im here i will help
[04:08] <lazzareth> phichipsi you could use ntfs-3g to mount the ntfs partition read and write-able? is that what your after?
[04:08] <kuja> Is anyone here running or has run Ubuntu off an external harddrive? (USB 2.0)
[04:08] <compengi> gnomefreak: okay thank you very much

[04:08] <pazemlsqdfmoj> anyone know of any problems with the update manager?
[04:09] <c_lisp> I use edgy though
[04:09] <lazzareth> pazemlsqdfmoj Whats wrong with   apt-get update  and  apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:09] <phichipsi> lazzareth, i just want to write to my new harddrive. i don't need to have it ntfs-formatted. i would be glad to know how i could format it with a fs i could write to easily and safely
[04:09] <phichipsi> lazzareth, problem is, i never did that before and have no clue how to do it
[04:10] <streak> hi
=== jomino_ is now known as jomino
[04:11] <lazzareth> phichipsi: In which case a simple graphic way of formatting it would be to use 'gparted'  (sudo apt-get install gparted)  then format it to ext3 filesystem then it will automount (if external) but otherwise its easy to add another line in your fstab
[04:11] <nolimitsoya> phichipsi, sudo apt-get install gparted && sudo gparted
[04:11] <bulmer> kuja yes I have installed dapper ubuntu for a friend on an external lacie usb 2.0 drive and runs off of it now at boot

[04:11] <kuja> bulmer: 5400 RPM HDD?
[04:11] <fyrestrtr> dark2y: why?
[04:11] <kuja> Or is it 7200?
[04:11] <nolimitsoya> dark2y, you shouldnt, but you can edit your fstab

[04:12] <kuja> bulmer: What were his computer specs, and how did you run performance wise?
[04:12] <dark2y> because it stops my boot...

[04:13] <dark2y> i have ubuntu 6.10 and when i boot ... when it gets to *checking file system
[04:13] <dark2y> it just stops..
[04:14] <lazzareth> dark2y: why are you even turning off your computer :P
[04:14] <nolimitsoya> dark2y, no errors? in that case, boot a live cd and do a manual fsck
[04:14] <pazemlsqdfmoj> lazzareth: not the apt-get, but the update manager you can access through administration or the orange icon at the top right of your screen
[04:14] <streak> i'm trying to install ubuntu in a pc (amd xp2400) with 3 hd. and on the boot screen the system alts saying that it can't connect to tty. if i unplug the 2 disks and leave only the disk where i want to install ubuntu the system boots ok.
[04:14] <streak> what can be wrong?
[04:14] <kuja> bulmer: I was planning on using my 60GB to run Ubuntu, because Windows doesn't like booting off USB disks, so I was just curious how the performance was. I'm running a Celeron 2.2GHz, oh well. Thanks :)

[04:15] <lazzareth> But apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade   is the cli equivalent !
[04:15] <bulmer> kuja: you're worried of Windows not booting of USB or is it Linux that you can not get running off of an external usb?
[04:15] <lazzareth> @ pazemlsqdfmoj ^
[04:15] <dark2y> let me try that..
[04:15] <pazemlsqdfmoj> lazzareth: i wish to see what exactly im updating before i update it, last time it uninstalled my soundcard :|
[04:16] <kuja> bulmer: Well, I'm installing now, it's just taking a very long time (installing Ubuntu on my USB HDD via QEMU cause I don't have CD burner to burn the CD image on). Windows does *not* boot off a USB harddrive.
[04:16] <streak> not. 1 is windows istalation and the other is formated in ntfs (for stockage) only one is empty for now
[04:16] <kuja> bulmer: Windows reinitializes the USB device at load time thus cutting off control and causing it to crash.
[04:16] <bulmer> kuja: fyi, my friends laptop runs normally windows xp, we have to tell its bios to go and have the external usb as the primary boot
[04:16] <lazzareth> dist-upgrade will give you the update summary before proceeding! it will ask whether it is ok to proceed
[04:16] <nolimitsoya> whould the developer mailinglist be a good place to ask for casper documentation?
[04:17] <kuja> bulmer: If my life depended on it, I probably couldn't get Windows to boot off my external :(
[04:17] <kuja> What did you have to do? Did you have to install the extra drivers?
[04:17] <bulmer> kuja: in the bios, it should detect your primary hdd and usb drive, then you select from which of the two it should be booting it off from
[04:18] <kuja> bulmer: I could do that with F9, and it gets up to the part where it starts to load Windows... then *bam*, it crashes.
[04:18] <bulmer> kuja: no external drivers, just on the Bios, we selected internal hdd or external hdd to boot from
[04:18] <gumuz> i have instaled ubuntu server with a wrong keyboard layout, anyone knows how to change it?
[04:18] <kuja> It is said this is a problem with Windows reinitializing the USB device.
[04:18] <nolimitsoya> !dev
[04:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dev - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:19] <bulmer> kuja: we did not load via the vmware or qemu emulation, the laptop is either going to boot to XP or Linux via the bios hdd selection
[04:19] <gumuz> any ideas?
[04:19] <kuja> bulmer: How was Windows installed in the first place?
[04:19] <bulmer> kuja: umm its distributed with XP as its installed OS when she bought it
[04:19] <kuja> bulmer: to the external, I mean. Did you boot into the CD natively?

[04:20] <|r466er|> www.ubuntuusers.de/paste/5125 can anybody help me please?
[04:20] <kuja> I know Linux can boot just fine from a USB external. But AFAIK, or thought, Windows can't.
[04:20] <bulmer> kuja: yes, in the BIOS< the sequence was 1) CDROM 2) ext usb drive 3) internal hdd
[04:21] <kuja> bulmer: That's just the same as pressing your function key to pop up the boot menu and selecting which device you'd like to boot, and I used the boot menu to boot the external and it crashed Windows after the loader popped up :(

[04:22] <phichipsi> lazzareth, hmm, i can't select the "fomat to" dialog, it is deactivated in gparted
[04:22] <m0biu5> can anyone tell me the benefits of using sparse memory over flat memory in kernel config
[04:22] <kuja> Also, Windows wouldn't install for me through booting from the CD, it didn't want to install on my external because there wasn't a free partition on my internal that it could write the MBR to.
[04:22] <bulmer> kuja: i dont know what you have done, but do it like so, recover to your Windows XP first okay..make sure everything is working
[04:22] <cosm0z`> gumuz, type dpkg-reconfigure console-data in ur console window
[04:23] <gumuz> it says console data not installed
[04:23] <lazzareth> phichipsi: you will need to delete the current ntfs partition before continuing
[04:23] <bulmer> kuja: you can boot off of live cd ubuntu ? or not at all?
[04:23] <phichipsi> lazzareth, well all the actions are deselected
[04:23] <kuja> bulmer: I can.
[04:23] <crow> Or even i cant boot to Safe Graphic mode...
[04:23] <crow> can somebody help me
[04:24] <bulmer> kuja: can you get back to your XP without a problem?
[04:24] <cosm0z`> gumuz, sudo apt-get install console-data
[04:24] <kuja> I don't have XP anymore. My internal (IDE) has Ubuntu installed. I would *like* to have my external (USB) to have Windows XP installed.
[04:25] <bulmer> kuja: ahh..that I dont know how to get your system to tell boot XP off USB..
[04:25] <lazzareth> phichipsi then the harddrive is currently active, go into terminal and type   sudo umount /dev/      then your hard drive followed by the partition number name  e.g.    umount /dev/sda1
[04:25] <kuja> bulmer: Oh, it *boots* XP off USB. Like I said, it gets to the Windows XP loader, then it crashes.
[04:25] <gumuz> it says not available, but replaced by unicode data
[04:25] <lazzareth> phichipsi Then reopen gparted and try again
[04:25] <bulmer> kuja: i wanted to try this myself, use VMWARE on linux and run XP on top of it..I have not done yet
[04:25] <gumuz> i install that
[04:25] <compengi> gnomefreak: i'm ready to install nvidia driver
[04:26] <compengi> !nvidia
[04:26] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:26] <gumuz> but reconfigure unicode-data doesnt do anything
[04:26] <gnomefreak> ok
[04:26] <kuja> The reason it crashes (from reading a lot around Google), is that Windows will reintialize the USB device in the middle of loading from it, that means it loses control of the device and can't read from it anymore, causing it to crash.
[04:26] <gnomefreak> compengi: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[04:26] <gnomefreak> compengi: let me know when thats done :)
[04:27] <higi> hello, i would rythmbox to go to the next song when i press a specific key
[04:27] <higi> is that possible?
[04:27] <bulmer> kuja: what you read is probably right, you should have not done the drastic move of wiping out XP on your internal..
[04:27] <compengi> gnomefreak: okay :)
[04:27] <kuja> bulmer: I never had XP on my internal.
[04:27] <gnomefreak> compengi: make sure you have linux-restricted-modules package for your kernel
[04:27] <compengi> gnomefreak: btw i have fx 5500 is it nvidia-glx-legacy or nvidia-glx?
[04:27] <bulmer> kuja: oh oh..my mistake..
[04:27] <kuja> I've always had Ubuntu on my internal. I would just like to have XP now so I could play some games natively... missing my games :)
[04:27] <gnomefreak> compengi: nvidia-glx
[04:28] <kuja> It's been a long time since I played games, just want to get back into it, you see :)
[04:28] <gnomefreak> compengi: i have 3 of those cards :)
[04:28] <gumuz> i cant install console data, why?
[04:28] <higi> hello, i would rythmbox to go to the next song when i press a specific key, is it possible?
[04:28] <compengi> gnomefreak: lol
[04:28] <bulmer> kuja: maybe you can try VMWARE? let me know as I'd like to run windows2003 off it too for learning
[04:28] <ubuntu_newb> thats the only thing that sucks about linux
[04:28] <compengi> gnomefreak: send me one :P
[04:28] <ubuntu_newb> you can't play windows games...
[04:28] <gnomefreak> :)
[04:28] <kuja> bulmer: I used to run Windows XP off VMWare a very long time ago. This was on a 500MHz machine. It was actually quite usable.
[04:29] <kuja> VMWare is a virtual machine though, you can't play games on it and get the same performance, you realize? :)
[04:29] <ubuntu_newb> vmware will let you run windows games?
[04:29] <ubuntu_newb> I have a core 2 duo system with 2 gigs of ram
[04:29] <sudharsh> ubuntu_newb, try cedega
[04:29] <gnomefreak> ubuntu_newb: you run windows in a vmware so yes you can do anything you would normally do
[04:29] <ubuntu_newb> I wonder if I could run VMWARE with xp and play games without lag
[04:29] <bulmer> kuja: am an old man, i dont do games that much at all other than majjong ..lol
[04:29] <kuja> ubuntu_newb: No, you can't.
[04:29] <crow> Hi all, i cant boot or install Ubuntu Edgy, I cant switch to console when it stop. It start to unpack kernel, and then it fill itself up to i think 90% and then it stop :(
[04:30] <kuja> Expect lots of lag, ubuntu_newb
[04:30] <phichipsi> lazzareth, let  me   itry
[04:30] <ubuntu_newb> I see
[04:30] <felixjet> hi, when i use sudo apt-get ... the console ask me for root password. how can i skip that?
[04:30] <ubuntu_newb> I play Desert Combat and BF2
[04:30] <kuja> The best way to play games on Linux is through Cedega
[04:30] <ubuntu_newb> I can't play them on linux
[04:30] <CrippsFX> heh ... I did a really newbie thing ... I was adding a module to /etc/modules using "sudo echo <modulename> > /etc/modules" ..thing is ">" over-writes the file whereas ">>" concatenates it ... does anyone know how I can get my old modules file back?
[04:30] <gnomefreak> felixjet: sudo -i
[04:30] <bobbby> hey im back
[04:30] <jrib> felixjet: it doesn't ask for your root password, it asks for your user password
[04:30] <elTigre> how can I limit the download bandwidth of apt-get or wget?
[04:30] <kuja> bulmer: =)
[04:30] <bulmer> :)
[04:30] <gnomefreak> felixjet: it will only ask when you open it with sudo -i
[04:30] <kuja> bulmer: Yeah, but it wasn't bad for clicking around and doing stuff :)
[04:31] <higi> hello, i would rythmbox to go to the next song when i press a specific key, is it possible?
[04:31] <kuja> bulmer: You don't even need to purchase VMWare.
[04:31] <felixjet> but, i used it days ago with no password, i just send sudo apt-get and it didnt ask for pass
[04:31] <ubuntu_newb> so even with a fast system I couldn't run windows games on a vmware windows xp image?
[04:31] <kuja> You can create a harddrive file using qemu-img.
[04:31] <kuja> And VMWare player can use it.
[04:31] <bulmer> kuja: right, my eyes are too weak to play those hi rez games...lol
[04:31] <bobbby> how do i log in as a router+
[04:32] <bobbby> on the 6.10 console, using the live cd
[04:32] <ubuntu_newb> as a router?
[04:32] <kuja> ubuntu_newb: Any computer can run the games, it's just not going to be fast.
[04:32] <bobbby> as a root*
[04:32] <sc0tty> I found my problem, now I still need a solution (working on it). the initrd.img file that ubuntu (re)wrote before rebooting is not valid ...
[04:32] <ubuntu_> Hello everyone :)
[04:32] <ubuntu_> How are you?
[04:32] <gnomefreak> compengi: are the drivers and linux-restricted-modules-(whatever uname-r says
[04:32] <gnomefreak> )
[04:32] <gnomefreak> installed?
[04:32] <ubuntu_newb> so even a core 2 duo E6400 couldn't run the game smoothly with vmware?
[04:32] <kuja> NO

[04:34] <jrib> bobbby: see what ubotu said
[04:34] <bulmer> bobby: what you want done?
[04:34] <gnomefreak> compengi: just to be sure please sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic
[04:34] <kuja> ubuntu_newb: You ever played Counter-Strike back in the day when we didn't have really good computers and when you used software rendering you'd be like, "This is so slow and laggy!" and then you put it on DirectX or OpenGL you'd be like "Oh wow, it's so much faster and smoother now!"?

[04:43] <Sikon> and only appear when I move the mouse over them
[04:43] <gnomefreak> compengi: no
[04:43] <gnomefreak> compengi: damnit
[04:43] <lazzareth> phichipsi: Ohh, by 'devicename' i dont mean the harddrive name, if ubuntu automounted it, it would be named something silly like 'usbdisk'? use that that name.
[04:43] <gnomefreak> compengi: open the file back up
[04:43] <gnomefreak> were gonna change the busid line
[04:43] <bobbby> vvvvvvvxwindows doesnt start  on my live session cd, how do i get it started
[04:44] <timbobsteve> hi all... I am trying to install packages from my Ubuntu 6.06 cd... but apt-get insists on downloading all the packages from the net... this is a pain, because my internet is slow... how do i force it to use the packages on the CD and not re-download them?
[04:44] <compengi> gnomefreak: change to what?
[04:44] <gnomefreak> 1:00.0
[04:44] <gnomefreak> compengi: make it read that
[04:44] <compengi> gnomefreak: 00?
[04:45] <bobbby> bbbbb
[04:45] <apokryphos> bobbby: what are you doing?
[04:45] <gnomefreak> compengi: yes you want it to read 1:00:0
[04:45] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: Order your sources in /etc/apt/sources.lst with cd-rom enabled and uncommented on top.
[04:45] <compengi> gnomefreak: okay done
[04:45] <gnomefreak> compengi: now save close close all others ctrl+alt+ackspace
[04:45] <gnomefreak> backspace even
[04:46] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie: i have done that and also ran an apt-get update, but it still insists on download all the files from the net.... I am trying to install ubuntu-desktop metapackage, which I KNOW is on the Ubuntu cd
[04:46] <bobbby> apokryphos: what?
[04:46] <gnomefreak> compengi: if it errors change the driver section to use vesa instead of nvidia
=== jack_ is now known as jerp
[04:46] <bobbby> apokryphos: im trying to get xwindows started :(
[04:46] <gnomefreak> than come back
[04:46] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: Well it goes with the newest copy.
[04:46] <bobbby> apokryphos: the xwindows have problems with my ati card
[04:46] <compengi> gnomefreak: okay and how to get of it if i'm stuck there?
[04:47] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: It could be that the cd is outdated. In which case you could install off the cd and at your next apt-get upgrade you'd have to download the whole thing again anyway.
[04:47] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie: i have recently ran an apt-get upgrade on my system... hmmmm... so how do I force it to install the older versions ?
[04:47] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: If you don't care about security patches or being up-to-date just comment out all the online repositories.
[04:48] <jerp> I have a malformed line in my /etc/apt/sources.list file, is there an easy way to correct that ?
[04:48] <gnomefreak> compengi: when it errors you will see a blue screen with text boxes read it remember lines with [EE]  and just go throught hte files til you are dropped to a login prompt log in than sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change driver to vesa than startx after saving it
[04:48] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie:  OK.. will try that
[04:48] <gnomefreak> jerp: what line
[04:48] <jerp> it says line 2 and that is the cd rom
[04:48] <bobbby> gnomefreak: i have the same problem and tryed to change de driver to vesa, but dint work
[04:48] <gnomefreak> jerp: add a # to the front of it if you plan on using the net for installing things
[04:49] <gnomefreak> bobbby: edgy?

[04:49] <bobbby> gnomefreak: mmm... im using the livecd
[04:49] <gnomefreak> bobbby: thats why
[04:49] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie: commenting out all the online sources and doing an apt update didn't work... it still wants the online versions :/
[04:49] <Tchaka> hello, someone knows how I can change the associate foto with my user (this one that we can see  at the start of GDM)
[04:49] <jerp> Ive gone insto synaptic and cleared the check marks and it didnt halt the error message

[04:50] <compengi> gnomefreak: it worked :D
[04:50] <bobbby> gnomefreak: so.. how do i do :S
[04:50] <surface> i can't find a lots of manual for programming API
[04:50] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie: ahhhh ok.. will try that. thx
[04:50] <gnomefreak> jerp: close synptic and in terminal type sudo apt-get update and paste the output to pastebin for someone to look at.
[04:50] <compengi> gnomefreak: thank you very much
[04:50] <gnomefreak> compengi: :)
[04:50] <gnomefreak> compengi: anytime
[04:50] <surface> for example i wanna find strlen, man strlen returns nothing
[04:51] <bobbby> i tryed dpkg-reconfigre xserver-xorg, but it gave me an error
[04:51] <jrib> surface: manpages-dev
[04:51] <gnomefreak> bobbby: that i dont know i dont play with livecd often enough. only time i use it is to test bugs :)
[04:51] <surface> what to apt-get for those manuals?
[04:51] <bobbby> gnomefreak: i tryed dpkg-reconfigre xserver-xorg, but it gave me an error
[04:51] <gnomefreak> bobbby: im not sure you can change the livecd video set up
[04:51] <bluszcz> hello
[04:51] <bluszcz> how can i play music using second sound device?
[04:51] <compengi> gnomefreak: what's the command to install all needed files for a certain program?
[04:51] <gnomefreak> its gonna read what it knows
[04:51] <compengi> i always forget it =/
[04:51] <jerp> gnomefreak, ok
[04:51] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie:  `apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`..... it is now saying that the package is not available... I have the cd inserted and everything : /
[04:52] <keithhhhh> how do you reduce the size of videos in Ubuntu, I have my own DV video I want to compress
[04:52] <gnomefreak> compengi: what program and are you gonna build it?
[04:52] <compengi> gnomefreak: x-chat
[04:52] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: are you sure the cd isn't commented out?
[04:52] <SlimG> samba wont start, where can i read the log?
[04:52] <gnomefreak> compengi: sudo aptitude install xchat  should get you the recommeded packages the suggested packages and the normal packages
[04:53] <baxter_kylie> keithhhhhh: !transcode
[04:53] <gnomefreak> compengi: if you are trying to build it from source its a bit different
[04:53] <compengi> gnomefreak: yeah from a source
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> this is probably a FAQ, but, with manpages, the charset doesn't seem to play nice with en_US.UTF-8 when LANG is set to that, what's the fix?
[04:53] <bobbby> gnomefreak: can i install directly without  starting the live session?
[04:53] <gnomefreak> compengi: or open synptic and search xchat and install everything you want
[04:53] <jerp> ok, it there in paste
[04:53] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie:  transcode is that the name of a program?
[04:53] <gnomefreak> compengi: sudo apt-get build-dep xchat
[04:53] <stojance> WHat is the program that uses this command: git clone git://dev.laptop.org/sugar-jhbuild ????????
[04:53] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie:  I am sure.... ok.. after all those commands I did an apt-cache search for ubuntu-desktop..... it turns out that meta-package isn't on the 6.06 CD.... funny though... I thought it would have been.... looks like I will have to bite the bullet...
[04:54] <gnomefreak> bobbby: you would need the alternate cd for that
[04:54] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: Yes. There's also mencoder.
[04:54] <patientfox> hi i just did a fresh install and i think i chose the wrong keyboard layout... how do i change it?
[04:54] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: thanks :) Ill try both
[04:54] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: But transcode has several guis that are very nice.
[04:54] <nox-Hand> Hello
[04:54] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve:
[04:54] <baxter_kylie> timbobsteve: Ahh.
[04:54] <bobbby> gnomefreak: ok thanxs
[04:55] <timbobsteve> baxter_kylie:  thanks for the help.
[04:55] <SlimG> samba wont start, where can I read it's log?
[04:55] <bobbby> have anyone started the live session of edgy with a ati card?
[04:55] <baxter_kylie> Anyone with a little mdadm experience here?
[04:55] <nox-Hand> My mate is installing Ubuntu on his laptop. When he has the partition table set up correctly, and he clicks next, it says no root partition! He has hda7 as ext3, reformat and mounted as / in the partition table editor
[04:55] <nox-Hand> Any ideas?
[04:55] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: ok Ill try it first thanks... any advice on video editing software.... like software with good transactions or can do titling
[04:55] <compengi> gnomefreak: can i use http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_add_extra_repositories for edgy?
[04:55] <burepe> I got an azureus warning in the bottom right that I can't get rid of. Any suggestions?
[04:56] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: One of those transcode based apps I know is quite excellent.
[04:56] <Pelo> burepe,  what is the warning ?
[04:56] <java1> Morin all
[04:56] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: I just can't remember the name. It's perl or python based... probably perl.
[04:56] <nox-Hand> This can't be fixed :-(
[04:57] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: thanx goign to try transcoder now  ;)
[04:57] <surface> jrib, thx
[04:57] <gnomefreak> compengi: you need the src repos for each. i would use the guide at help.ubuntu.com
[04:57] <java1> Had an question on install of software main, just got cd in mail
[04:57] <burepe> If you have a router/firewall, please check that you have port 63327 UDP open. Decentralized tracking requires this. 2 more messages
[04:57] <gnomefreak> now i am going to go smoke
[04:57] <Pelo> nox-Hand, if you don'T get an answer here try looking it up in the forum
[04:57] <patientfox> does anyone know how to change the keyboard layout after an install?
[04:57] <Pelo> burepe,  do you have a router ?
[04:58] <burepe> Pelo; up above but I think t he problem is just the gui
[04:58] <compengi> gnomefreak: okay thank you and have fun
[04:58] <burepe> Pelo; I just got fiber and I got a router but it should be fine
[04:58] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: I think I'm thinking of dvdrip
[04:58] <burepe> I just can't get rid of the warning
[04:58] <jerp> going into .... system/preferences/keyboard ???
[04:58] <burepe> like i can't click it off
[04:59] <Pelo> burepe,  when using a router with any bittorent client you need to forward ports,  go and ask for help on this in #azureus-support ,  on this network
[04:59] <jerp> second tab
[04:59] <fyrestrtr> burepe: that's a known bug in azureus.
[04:59] <burepe> pelo, it is not a router problem
[04:59] <burepe> thanks
[04:59] <jerp> layout
[04:59] <burepe> fyrestrtr: is there a way to get rid of it?
[04:59] <java1> Ok I'll try forums first then if not there will be back ty for time
[04:59] <fyrestrtr> burepe: I had mine fixed by downloading the latest beta at the time, I believe the current version has this bug resolved. You can download it from their website.
[05:00] <Pelo> burepe,  it is a router problem  trust me , I use to be an op in #azureus
[05:00] <baxter_kylie> Anyone with any basic mdadm experience here? I just need to initialize an array but I'm terrified of doing something to erase it.
[05:00] <djbryy> LjL, this one is nuts !!       http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31239/
[05:00] <burepe> Pelo listen to what fyrestrtr is saying
[05:00] <fyrestrtr> Pelo: his problem is that he cannot dismiss the popup, not that he can't forward the ports.
[05:00] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: by the way what version of transcode do you use?
[05:00] <burepe> yeah
[05:00] <burepe> thanks
[05:00] <Jimmey> How can I change the theme in XGL?
[05:00] <bobbby> This is lame: so anyone with ati cards wont be able to use the live cd?
[05:00] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: whatever's newest in the repositories.
[05:01] <fyrestrtr> Jimmey: install the theme manager -- please ask xgl questions in #ubuntu-xgl
[05:01] <fyrestrtr> bobbby: where did you get that idea?
[05:01] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: ya but I cant seem to find it in the repositories, I found a deb version though on the net
[05:01] <xd45> anyone here adept in partitioning? I am trying to set up partition for a new install that would enable me to keep media like movies, music and sensitive data separate from an install incase something breaks
[05:02] <burepe> fyrestrtr: I just downloaded this one though. I wonder if it is fixed.
[05:02] <fyrestrtr> xd45: create a separate home partition, and store all your files in your home directory.
[05:02] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: $sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dvdrip
[05:02] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: well u have that problem and i havent found the solution, some so called solutions just work for the not live cd
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> xd45: ideal would be to have a separate disk
[05:02] <Kingsqueak> xd45: reason is, it's easy to delete a partition or reformat it by mistake on install
[05:02] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: well i* have that problem and i havent found the solution, some so called solutions just work for the not live cd
[05:02] <fyrestrtr> burepe: the problem is with some java libs (I forgot the exact one) -- but if you run the script that comes in the zip download, it will load the libs from the archive itself, and not your system-wide libs, and that solves the problem.
[05:03] <xd45> I do not have a separate disk, so that is out: what I was thinking was something like /home /movies /music etc?
[05:03] <fyrestrtr> bobbby: what problem do you have exactly?
[05:03] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: If you haven't already you must enable universe and multiverse repositories.
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> xd45: well when you format the drive, just create a partition for that
[05:03] <fyrestrtr> xd45: you don't need a separate disk, just a separate partition.
[05:03] <xd45> But I have always used the default partitions and don't know how to label everything properly etc
[05:03] <nox-Hand> Pelo, Right, found the problem, and fixed it :) Thanks
[05:03] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: Ill look into it but I thought I did
[05:03] <Kingsqueak> xd45: just write down which one it is so you don't forget
[05:03] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: also I dont need dvdrip
[05:03] <xd45> like what about /tmp /var etc
[05:04] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: Im just looking to compress my own avi videos
[05:04] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: okay. dvd rip is a perl frontend for transcode
[05:04] <xd45> I have a 60 GB hd and would like to use most of it for the media and as little as possible for the install
[05:04] <burepe> fyrestrtr: that is a little over my head but thanks
[05:04] <xd45> make sense?
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> xd45: you should add your own and call the mountpoint /mymedia or something unrelated to an install
[05:04] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: i downloaded the live cd of 6.10, but the xwindow doesnt start, i have tryed to change the driver to mesa, but didnte work, i tryed dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but didnt work
[05:04] <baxter_kylie> keithhhh: replace 'dvdrip' with 'transcode' if you just want a command-line only version.
[05:04] <jerp> my problem is the apt-get update response: E: Malformed line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-universe.list (dist parse)
[05:04] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: i downfyrestrtr: the driver to vesa *
[05:05] <Chetic> I can't start the Ubuntu installation because it can't even start X.. Says no screens found. Please, please help
[05:05] <jrib> jerp: pastebin your sources.list
[05:05] <xd45> Kingsqueak: k, but what about the most important parts like swap etc
[05:05] <keithhhhh> ah ok cool
[05:05] <jerp> jrib okie doke
[05:05] <xd45> I do no know how large they should be or what all I NEED to make it all work
[05:05] <nox-Hand> How does ShockWave work in Linux?
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> xd45: let the installer pick those, but you'll need to go into manual mode to override what it suggests
[05:05] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: sorry, i changed the driver to vesa*
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> xd45: /swap should be at least equal to RAM, if you don't have a ton of RAM, it should be double
[05:05] <jrib> nox-Hand: adobe doesn't make shockwave for linux, so it doesn't really.  Best you can do is install it in a firefox running through wine
[05:06] <xd45> i have 256 mb of ram
[05:06] <Kingsqueak> xd45: then setup the install to do  /  /swap  /mymedia
[05:06] <Kingsqueak> xd45: make your /swap 512M then for some added headroom if something goes wrong with a process
[05:06] <xd45> ok
[05:06] <xd45> ok what about size of / and /home
[05:06] <xd45> ?
[05:07] <Akuma_> #gnome
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> you said 60G right, I'd make / hmm 10G just to leave yourself some extra room, you could make it smaller, but not a great plan IMO
[05:07] <xd45> hmm?
[05:07] <dk0r> Why can't I find Firefox 2 in Synaptic ?
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> xd45: leave /home on /, don't split it out , it's simpler
[05:07] <xd45> you mean home?
[05:07] <jerp> jrib, it up at paste bin
[05:07] <bobbby> fyrestrtr: any idea?
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> xd45: /home will actually be on / unless you make a seperate partition for it
[05:08] <jrib> jerp: what is the url?
[05:08] <xd45> Kingsqueak: u if I put /home on its own partition it would help if something breaks, right?
[05:08] <dk0r> Why can't I find Firefox 2 in Synaptic ?
[05:08] <jrib> dk0r: what version of ubuntu are you using?
[05:08] <dk0r> 6.06
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> xd45: yeah it could, you could install if you note what partition that is, and keep the data
[05:08] <jrib> dk0r: 6.06 doesn't have firefox 2
[05:08] <Chetic> Why can't the install CD start X? It says it can't find any devices
[05:08] <xd45> Kingsqueak: can I pm ya
[05:08] <jerp> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31241/
[05:08] <dk0r> jrib: So i cannot install it?
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> xd45: my only concern is that you need to be careful with a reinstall to avoid formatting an existing partition and without really understanding this already, I fear you may do that by mistake is all
[05:09] <LeeHarvey> xd45 putting your /home elsewhere will let you re-install or repair installs without losing your desktop and user preferences.
[05:09] <bobbby> Chetic: hey man i have the same problem, are using the live cd?
[05:09] <jrib> dk0r: you can, but not through the package manager (unless you upgrade to 6.10).  Do you want the instructions on installing it without using the apckage manager?
[05:09] <xd45> LeeHarvey: I se maybe that is what I should do
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> xd45: I'd prefer not, just because I have several windows going already
[05:09] <LeeHarvey> I use it on another partition so i can share my settings across various flavors too.
[05:09] <dk0r> jrib: Sure. Got a link? I downloaded the file from mozillas site, but i dont know what to do with it.
[05:09] <jrib> !firefox > dk0r
[05:09] <Kingsqueak> xd45: plus you get ideas from everybody this way
[05:10] <LeeHarvey> I run xubuntu, mandrake and gentoo, all sharing the same /home directory
[05:10] <xd45> LeeHarvey: I have never partitioned other than using the defaults
[05:10] <xd45> so this is new waters for me
[05:10] <xd45> cool
[05:10] <xd45> right Kingsqueak
[05:10] <prestosd> anyone know how to fix a shutdown splash problem??
[05:10] <LeeHarvey> It's not as scary as it looks
[05:10] <dk0r> jrib: thanks
[05:10] <jrib> dk0r: np
[05:10] <Chetic> bobbby, I think so
[05:11] <jrib> jerp: what line did it say had a syntax error?
[05:11] <minimec> oufff!!! Let's say I am happy to know a lot about debian and the console. My dapper-Edgy update wasn't clean at all!! well now I got my xserver back running and with aptitude I was able to do a clean update. Took me an hour!
[05:11] <LeeHarvey> Anyone have an X-fi soundsystem?
[05:11] <xd45> LeeHarvey: how would you suggest splitting up a 60 gb hd?
[05:11] <Chetic> bobbby, what the hell do we do?
[05:11] <LeeHarvey> I've read several places it is unsupported until 2007
[05:11] <LeeHarvey> xd45: personal preference really.
[05:11] <Kingsqueak> xd45: is this just a file server or a graphical workstation?
[05:11] <dk0r> jrib: What is libstdc++5 ? That page says it needs to be installed, but gives no reason why or what it is.
[05:11] <xd45> workstation
[05:12] <pooh_beawr> where can I find instructions on upgrading to eft?
[05:12] <LeeHarvey> i generally give root about 10 gigs, but i don't use a seperate partition for apps or /usr
[05:12] <fyrestrtr> xd45: 10 for /, the rest for /home
[05:12] <jrib> dk0r: libstdc++5 - The GNU Standard C++ Library v3
[05:12] <Kingsqueak> xd45: other than your media files, how much data files do you generally make?  That will determine /home if you store them there
[05:12] <Otacon22> can I use mplayer for seeing TV by a TV card? Actually I use "Tv Zapping" and work good
[05:12] <xd45> Kingsqueak: quite a few
[05:12] <dk0r> jrib: Is that allready installed on 6.06 ?
[05:12] <jerp> I don care for the charcoal splash screen in edgy, it brings out the flaws in my LCD
[05:12] <Kingsqueak> xd45: what fyrestrtr suggested might be the easy way for you , just make /home/media once you setup the partition on /home and keep your media files there
[05:13] <jrib> dk0r: you can check with   apt-cache policy libstdc++5
[05:13] <xd45> see what I would like is to save most data files on a separate partition that way if i want to reinstall or switch distros I can just leave them
=== topyli_ is now known as topyli
[05:13] <Kingsqueak> xd45: or just keep them in your own /home if it's just you
[05:13] <jerp> someone took a brillo to the screen surface
[05:13] <Chetic> How do you start the LiveCD with different graphics drivers? Since the "ati" driver doesn't work
[05:13] <Akuma_> is there a way to hide gnome's notification area, in the same way winxp does with the system tray?
[05:13] <dk0r> Hrm.. Ok. I'll have to get familiar w/ the command line then.
[05:13] <jrib> dk0r: well you could check the same thing in synaptic too
[05:14] <xd45> as it stands right now I have 40+ GB of data to back up after i reinstall so I want to avoid that in the future by just leaviing them on the disk\
[05:14] <fyrestrtr> Akuma_: its just a plugin to the panel, you can remove the plugin by right clicking it.
[05:14] <LeeHarvey> Akuma_: probably.. just remove the plugin
[05:14] <LeeHarvey> but i don't use gnome... and someone else agreed so i guess I was right
[05:14] <xd45> which is why i want a partition for those files, make sense?
[05:14] <Akuma_> fyrestrtr: LeeHarvey: i wanna keep it, i'd just like it to take less space
[05:14] <Kingsqueak> xd45: yeah just make a /home then, the only catch there is when you change releases, sometimes it's useful to wipe out your .dotfiles so things run more predictably
[05:14] <dk0r> jrib: Will do. But I need to learn command line anyways. Does that bot have a link to an apt-get command line tutorial ?
[05:15] <jrib> !apt > dk0r
[05:15] <fyrestrtr> !apt | dk0r
[05:15] <ubotu> dk0r: apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[05:15] <LeeHarvey> Akuma_: I *think* you can adjust it.  But i don't use gnome, so don't swear by my theory
[05:15] <xd45> Kingsqueak: if I just make a home, i will lose everything if i need to reinstall right?
[05:15] <jerp> akuma right clik and find remove
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> xd45: not if you tell the installer not to reformat it
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> xd45: that's what you need to remember
[05:15] <dk0r> jrib:  Thanks again.
[05:15] <Akuma_> jerp: i dont want to remove it
[05:15] <LeeHarvey> yeah, don't format /home
[05:15] <LeeHarvey> its even easier to remember if you have 2 drives
[05:15] <Kingsqueak> xd45: and I'd still recommend you back it up just to be safe, it's an easy mistake to make
[05:16] <Kingsqueak> yup
[05:16] <LeeHarvey> I've got a 20 gig and 3 200 gig drives
[05:16] <xd45> ok, i'm getting confused now
[05:16] <LeeHarvey> so i only mess with format/partitioning on the 20 gig drive
[05:16] <jerp> akuma, you want to edit what and how long it appears
[05:16] <fyrestrtr> xd45: if you choose the 'default partitioning scheme' option, then you will lose it all, since most distros gladly take over the entire disk. You'll have to be careful when installing other distros as to customize the partitioning.
[05:16] <topyli> Akuma_: you can't make it smaller. the problem is that so many apps misuse it
[05:16] <Chetic> How do you start the LiveCD with different graphics drivers? Since the "ati" driver doesn't work
[05:16] <jerp> ic, Im not sure about that
[05:16] <fyrestrtr> Chetic: are you trying to test out ubuntu or install it?
[05:16] <topyli> Akuma_: it's the notification area, it's for notifications only. but many apps choose to park there forever
[05:16] <jrib> jerp: what line did it say had a syntax error?
[05:16] <jerp> 2
[05:17] <Kingsqueak> xd45: what fyrestrtr and LeeHarvey said is why I suggested another drive since you're new to this, it's safer
[05:17] <xd45> Ok so spliting up 60 gb / 10 GB /home 10 gb /media 40 gb?
[05:17] <Kingsqueak> xd45: just make /home 50G
[05:17] <jrib> jerp: have you edited the file since then?
[05:17] <LeeHarvey> 10 gb for /home!  wowie
[05:17] <Kingsqueak> xd45: it will be simpler for you to remember
[05:17] <jerp> jrib that top line #1 is what I enthered in the paste bin aplet
[05:17] <fyrestrtr> xd45: recommend / = 10 GB, /home = rest.
[05:17] <Akuma_> topyli: well i do find it convenient that, say, gaim stays there all the time. i guess i'm used to the Windows way. what would the alternative be, call gaim from the command line all the time?
[05:17] <LeeHarvey> I give my /home 1 gb, but i've got another partition for /home/[myusername] /Media
[05:17] <Kingsqueak> xd45: keep your media in /home/xd45/media or /home/media something like that
[05:17] <xd45> and swap 256?
[05:18] <xd45> err 512 for swap
[05:18] <fyrestrtr> xd45: how much ram do you have?
[05:18] <jerp> jrib I went into synaptic reps and cleared both cd rom entry
[05:18] <Kingsqueak> yeah 512 would be better
[05:18] <xd45> 256 mb
[05:18] <jrib> jerp: do you get the error when you run  'sudo apt-get update' now?
[05:18] <jerp> yes
[05:18] <Chetic> fyrestrtr, I want to install it
[05:18] <topyli> Akuma_: the correct way would be to minimize the window
[05:18] <dk0r> Is there a keyboard shortcut for the terminal ?
[05:18] <fyrestrtr> Chetic: just use the alternate cd to install.
[05:18] <fyrestrtr> dk0r: alt+f2
[05:18] <LeeHarvey> I also use FAT32 for my storage/media subfolders, only because I play too many games and have to dualboot with XP
[05:18] <xd45> ok one other thing this is a celeronn 533mhtz whats filesystem would be best?
[05:18] <LeeHarvey> so i can get to my movies/music from all OS's
[05:19] <topyli> Akuma_: then you'd choose whether or not you want it to show up in the window list ("task bar" in windows)
[05:19] <dk0r> fryestrtr: thanks
[05:19] <jrib> jerp: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list      delete the first 6 lines * above "deb http:..."
[05:19] <Chetic> fyrestrtr, Why the alternate? I'm on a very slow connection so I would REALLY like to avoid waiting another day to install..
[05:19] <fyrestrtr> Chetic: because the alternate is not a live cd, just an installer.
[05:19] <jerp> jrib ok
[05:19] <Akuma_> topyli: yeah, that'd be annoying. seems to me gaim being in the systray is really a 'misuse'.. btw would you know if there's a way to make panels hide faster?
[05:20] <Akuma_> topyli: *isn't
[05:20] <Alakazamz0r> Would this ( http://www.directron.com/bfgr73256gsoce.html ) card be good enough to play new games on low settings?
[05:20] <dk0r> fyrestrtr: alt+f2 brings up a run application windows, not the terminal, correct?
[05:20] <LeeHarvey> Akuma_: you can change the speed at which the panels hide, i believe you can just alt-click on the panel to get the preferences
[05:20] <dk0r> window*
[05:20] <Alakazamz0r> Im going to buy a decient video card today
[05:20] <topyli> Akuma_: it would show up in the window chooser which is only the size of one icon. it would show up in the notification area whenever there's something to notify about
[05:21] <LeeHarvey> if not, it may be in your system settings menu somewhere.. don't remember
[05:21] <LeeHarvey> hated gnome
[05:21] <topyli> Akuma_: then again, gaim is not a gnome application, it does what it wants
[05:21] <Chetic> So there's no way to just start the installation with the livecd using like vesa graphics drivers?
[05:21] <LeeHarvey> I was so excited about xubuntu.. finally no more KDE/Gnome bloat
[05:21] <dk0r> Is there a keyboard shortcut to the terminal? not run application(alt+f2) ?
[05:21] <fyrestrtr> Chetic: I think there is a safe mode option in the boot menu.
[05:21] <fyrestrtr> dk0r: if there isn't you can set it easily.
[05:22] <jrib> dk0r: you can set one in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
[05:22] <xd45> damn phone...
[05:22] <dk0r> jrib:  Thank you.
[05:22] <jerp> jrib, so line 1 should be ........ deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/edgy/ edgy main restricted
[05:22] <jrib> jerp: yes
[05:22] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: that seems like it would be supported by NVidia's drivers, yeah, no idea how well it works, I don't game
[05:22] <Akuma_> LeeHarvey: all i could find was hide/don't hide..
[05:22] <xd45> LeeHarvey: one more time, can you explain how to set it up?
[05:22] <xd45> i had a phone call
[05:23] <Alakazamz0r> Thanks for answering Kingsqueak :) I have NO IDEA about X vs Y when it comes to video cards.
[05:23] <Kingsqueak> LeeHarvey: yeah the xfce config from Ubuntu is pretty nice too
[05:23] <jrib> jerp: umm I should have said  nano -w, don't save if nano is wrapping lines now
[05:23] <keithhhhh> baxter_kylie: ok much thanks Ill try soon gotta get some sleep
[05:23] <Akuma_> topyli: what's the window chooser? alt+tab?
[05:23] <Chetic> fyrestrtr, that will just end up showing garbled graphics.. The only changes happening is in a thin green line in the middle of the screen..
[05:23] <prestosd> can anyone help me with a shutdown splash problem?
[05:23] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: you want to check NVidia's site for the linux drivers to be sure any of their cards is supported, that one is o.k. from what google tells me
[05:23] <Alakazamz0r> yeah, im pretty sure its supported.
[05:23] <jerp> I don think it wraping
[05:23] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: with linux, getting a card a few generations older is wiser generally and that one should be fine
[05:24] <Alakazamz0r> its an NVidia chipset
[05:24] <topyli> Akuma_: it's a panel applet that simply lists all windows when you click it (unlike the taskbar-like window list)
[05:24] <topyli> more like the one in mac
[05:24] <prestosd> can anyone help me with a shutdown splash problem?!
[05:24] <dk0r> What is the most popular irc client ?
[05:24] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: try something like this in google  GeForce 7300 linux support
[05:24] <jerp> Im gonna do a sudo apt-get update now
[05:25] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: from what that got me, it seems like it's well supported
[05:25] <Alakazamz0r> Kingsqueak, i know fora fact that its supported
[05:25] <Alakazamz0r> :)
[05:25] <Alakazamz0r> :D
[05:25] <topyli> Akuma_: btw it seems you indeed can define the hide speed in gconf
[05:25] <LeeHarvey> xd45: read private
[05:25] <jerp> jrib, Im getting the same reply
[05:25] <xd45> LeeHarvey: ok
[05:26] <xd45> LeeHarvey: did not recieve private
[05:26] <jerp> Il open synaptic
[05:26] <Kingsqueak> Alakazamz0r: fwiw, I have nvidia on both my laptop and this workstation and it works well on both, two different types but both nvidia
[05:26] <jrib> jerp: do you have a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*  file?
[05:26] <Akuma_> topyli: i found window selector, guess thats what you mean. it might fit my need.. if i could get gaim to play nice with it ..
[05:26] <Blario> Guys: what's  the best dapper to edgy eft upgrade guide that you guys know of online?
[05:26] <topyli> Akuma_: open the configuration editor, browse to apps/panel/global and set panel_show_delay. i guess that would be it
[05:26] <Alakazamz0r> cool Kingsqueak
[05:26] <jrib> jerp: I think universe.list was in your error, pastebin that if you do
[05:26] <Akuma_> topyli: let me try it ..
[05:27] <LeeHarvey> xd45: i sent you several
[05:27] <xd45> LeeHarvey: I am not getting them for some reason?
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> xd45: what chat client are you using?
[05:27] <xd45> irssi
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> xd45: maybe they are in a hidden window, try /window next   do that several times to see if they are there in another window
[05:27] <LeeHarvey> quick repeat here... I've got 10 gb for /, matched my ramsize for swap, 1 gb for /home and the rest for /media (formated FAT32 for windows friendly storage)
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> xd45: a ctrl-n will do it too I think
[05:28] <xd45> Kingsqueak: I have switched through all windows
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> k

[05:28] <xd45> err drats
[05:28] <xd45> thats why
[05:29] <iku_> can anybody tell me why my window titles are flashing? i am on xgl + beryl + twinview
[05:29] <LeeHarvey> I link my /media into my /home user folder
[05:29] <LeeHarvey> but you can just mount it straight in as well.. /home/[username] /media
[05:30] <Akuma_> topyli: hmm, i guess i might have to restart X. will, thats exactly what i was looking for.. thank you very much for you help
[05:30] <Akuma_> topyli: *well
[05:30] <topyli> cool
[05:30] <xd45> I see, so if I were to do / 10 GB /swp 512 MB /home 2 GB /media = rest
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> xd45: you get the partition vs mountpoint vs filesystem differences?
[05:30] <xd45> Kingsqueak: no
[05:30] <dk0r> Why can't I copy/paste into the terminal ?
[05:30] <LeeHarvey> xd45: thats roughly how I do it
[05:30] <dk0r> I mean.. Why can't I paste into the terminal ?
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> xd45: k, partition is the physical part of the disk if the disk is /dev/sda the first partition would be /dev/sda1
[05:30] <LeeHarvey> never had any problems.  Just remember to pick a friendly format for any other OS's you may use for your /media
[05:30] <iku_> can anybody tell me why my window titles are flashing? i am on xgl + beryl + twinview
[05:31] <xd45> what filesystem should i use , I do not use windows and this is an old 533 mhtz celeron 256 mb ram
[05:31] <xd45> Kingsqueak:  i think i get it
[05:31] <LeeHarvey> reiserFS?
[05:31] <jrib> dk0r: how are you trying to paste?  What are you pressing?
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> xd45: a partition can be any filesystem you make it, with linux generally it's ext3 these days, so you make a partition, then you put a filesystem on it, the installer does that for you, so for the example now you have /dev/sda1 the first partition of /dev/sda, with filesystem ext3 on it.  From there you need to mount it
[05:32] <dk0r> jrib: cntrl+v
[05:32] <LeeHarvey> just use the "default" which is ext3 i believe
[05:32] <xd45> hmm
[05:32] <LeeHarvey> if you're not OS swapping
[05:32] <jrib> dk0r: ctrl-shift-v
[05:32] <Kingsqueak> xd45: from that point you mount it    so   mount /dev/sda1 /mountpoint   where 'mountpoint' can be whatever you want to call it
[05:32] <dk0r> jrib: for terminal only ?
[05:32] <jrib> dk0r: yeah, ctrl-v means something else in terminal
[05:32] <xd45> ok what is the difference between hda and sda?
[05:32] <dk0r> jrib: figured. But what?
[05:33] <james> well that was fun! \
[05:33] <xd45> i am getting more lost by the minute
[05:33] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the way the system detects the drive, hda is ide, sda is ide-scsi or scsi
[05:33] <jrib> dk0r: try ctrl-v ctrl-v  (it inserts the literal character that you pressed)
[05:33] <james> I rebooted and had to completely reconfigure X...... but it has strange refresh rates like 54.5hz and 59hz
[05:33] <dk0r> jrib: Gotcha. But of what use is that?
[05:33] <jrib> dk0r: I've used it to search for
[05:33] <jerp> jrib,  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31247/
[05:33] <Feldegast> hda is ide and sda is sata
[05:34] <jrib> dk0r: ^M in a file
[05:34] <xd45> hmm
[05:34] <xd45> ok i'm officially lost
[05:34] <Feldegast> why so?
[05:34] <dk0r> jrib: What does ^M do ?
=== james is now known as Daylighter
[05:34] <Random_Transit> hey can anyone tell me what library i need to play m4p files?
[05:34] <xd45> just unaware whatra scsi sata ide means
[05:34] <dk0r> jrib What does ^M result in when searching for it?
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> xd45: you have a drive, the system sees it as /dev/hda, on that drive you have / /swap and /home  those would be /dev/hda1 (/) /dev/hda2 (/swap) and /dev/hda3 (/home) generally
[05:35] <Daylighter> there, this is the nickname I go by everywhere else
[05:35] <warkruid> dk0r: ^M is an dos/windows end of line marker
[05:35] <Feldegast> sda might also be scsi, i've never had one so i don't know
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> xd45: dont' worry about that for now, it's just the type of drive and how the system sees it
[05:35] <xd45> ok
[05:35] <dk0r> warkruid: So what application has it in ubuntu ?
[05:35] <warkruid> dkor: shows up in files made under windoze
[05:35] <xd45> what about my cdrom drive and floppy
[05:36] <dk0r> oh.
[05:36] <jrib> jerp: ok well they don't have any components specified after edgy, like "universe" for example
[05:36] <wildchild> Is there any DJ program for (k)ubuntu like tractor or virtual DJ in windows, please help
[05:36] <dk0r> warkruid: So you use ^M or ^V when searching for windows files ?
[05:36] <Kingsqueak> xd45: they will show up differently depending on the device types they are, cd can be /dev/hdb or /dev/sda etc.
[05:36] <warkruid> dkor: you could use it for that
[05:36] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the system sort of takes care of all that when it starts up
[05:36] <dk0r> warkruid: hrm. Ok. Thanks.
[05:37] <Blario> Guys: what's  the best dapper to edgy eft upgrade guide that you guys know of online?
[05:37] <xd45> ok so i do not need to add partitions for them?
[05:37] <Kingsqueak> xd45: right
[05:37] <xd45> ahh k
[05:37] <jerp> jrib, is that why it said to be malformed?
[05:37] <xd45> so basicall y all i need to worry about is / /swp /home and /media
[05:37] <jrib> jerp: I'm guessing so.  Try just adding " universe" to the end of the line and updating
[05:37] <xd45> ok this makes it less confusing
[05:37] <Kingsqueak> xd45: yup
[05:37] <jrib> jerp: though you seem to have uncovered a bug if this is the case
[05:38] <jerp> jrib ok
[05:38] <Kingsqueak> xd45: sorry, it's a bit weird at first to understand
[05:38] <xd45> ok and those should all be hda1 hda2 hda3 ?
[05:38] <xd45> etc?
[05:38] <xd45> or sda
[05:38] <Kingsqueak> xd45: yup, the partitioner should pick those automatically for you
[05:38] <xd45> aha
[05:38] <xd45> excellent
[05:38] <xd45> anything else I should know before I do it?
[05:38] <dk0r> Why cant I mkdir in ~/Examples ?
[05:38] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the partitioner will 'know' if it's hda or sda basically
[05:38] <xd45> aha!
[05:39] <felixjet> !divx

[05:39] <xd45> thank god for small miracles lol
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the only thing to be aware of is the type of filesystem, swap needs to be 'swap'
[05:39] <jrib> dk0r: because it's probably a symlink to a place outside your ~ that you don't have proper permissions for
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the rest need to be type 83 or 'linux' depending on how the partitioner tells you
[05:39] <felixjet> mmmm what package is for divx files?
[05:39] <xd45> ok
[05:39] <dk0r> jrib: Right. because I keep getting a Permission Denied error.
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> xd45: again, that should be fairly automagic
[05:39] <xd45> i think I can handle that
[05:40] <xd45> now before I do a fresh install, is it good to do a rm -rf * in / ?
[05:40] <dk0r> jrib: But how can it be outside my ~/ if it is "~/Examples"
[05:40] <jrib> dk0r: try 'ls -ld ~/Examples'
[05:40] <Kingsqueak> xd45: nah, don't bother, when it partitions the disk it wipes anything out anyway
[05:40] <xd45> ok, cool
[05:40] <dk0r> jrib: But how can Examples be outside my ~/ if it is "~/Examples"
[05:40] <Kingsqueak> xd45: it basically forgets where everything is when you partition
[05:40] <xd45> thanks a bunch for your help Kingsqueak LeeHarvey fyrestrtr
[05:40] <sloucher> felixjet: all will be clear http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#generalnotes
[05:40] <jrib> dk0r: the symlink is in ~, but the symlink points to /usr/share/example-content/
[05:40] <ohoel> BJRN OLAI
[05:41] <Kingsqueak> xd45: no problem
[05:41] <xd45> I have a couple cd's to burn and then i'll do a fresh install
[05:41] <dk0r> jrib: symlink = shortcut ?
[05:41] <ohoel> bjorn_:
[05:41] <jrib> dk0r: same idea
[05:41] <xd45> i have been using ubuntu since breezy preview and never did a fresh install..
[05:41] <xd45> and a lot of stuff broke along the way
[05:41] <xd45> lol
[05:41] <warkruid> dk0r: correct
[05:41] <bjorn_> hei ohoel
[05:41] <dk0r> jrib: ok. What is 'ls -ld ~/Examples' ?
[05:41] <dk0r> Whats the ls -ld
[05:42] <Kingsqueak> xd45: yeah when you switch releases and do upgrades I've found it smoother to take my /home/user, cp it to /home/user.old and start with a clean /home/user again and just copy the .old data files back over
[05:42] <warkruid> dk0r: ls is list files
[05:42] <jrib> dk0r: ls lists stuff, -l lists lots of info, -d makes it list directory info, not stuff inside the directory.  Type  'man ls' for more details
[05:42] <iku_> can anybody tell me why my window titles are flashing? i am on xgl + beryl + twinview. only get it when "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" is turned off
[05:42] <Kingsqueak> xd45: the reason are all the settings in .dotfiles, as versions change configs can get screwy, particularly gconfd and other gnome stuff
[05:42] <xd45> ahh, good idea
[05:42] <LeeHarvey> no trouble xd45
[05:42] <dk0r> jrib / warkruid: thanks
[05:42] <felixjet> mmmm what package is for divx files?
[05:42] <LeeHarvey> erggg
[05:42] <xd45> oh
[05:43] <LeeHarvey> did you search for divx?
[05:43] <xd45> one more question
[05:43] <fyrestrtr> felixjet: install vlc or mplayer
[05:43] <LeeHarvey> just use vlc.
[05:43] <xd45> what about tmp on it's own partition?
[05:43] <LeeHarvey> oh... grr, beaten to the punch again
[05:43] <xd45> good idea or no??
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> xd45: don't bother for now
[05:43] <xd45> k
[05:43] <fyrestrtr> xd45: not for you :)
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> xd45: if you knew if it was a good idea or not, you would have another answer, for now, dont' bother with it
[05:44] <ranok> Does anyone know where I can find a tutorial/howto for enabling SELinux on 6.10
[05:44] <xd45> ok, will do
[05:44] <xd45> one more q
[05:44] <xd45> ext2 vs ext3 ?
[05:44] <dk0r> So how do I get permission to mkdir in '/usr/share/example-content'
[05:44] <xd45> differences?>
[05:44] <fyrestrtr> stop saying one more question.
[05:44] <wasabi> xd45: ext3 has a journal
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xd45: 3 has journaling, means it will recover from a power outage much better, use 3
[05:45] <xd45> k
[05:45] <xd45> and what about reiser?
[05:45] <niekie> ranok, try #ubuntu-hardened
[05:45] <warkruid> dkor: why should you want to do that?
[05:45] <ranok> anyone?
[05:45] <unimatrix9> who is running ubuntu on the new lenovo laptop?
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xd45: stick to 3 for now
[05:45] <dk0r> warkruid: Just messing around getting familiar with the os.
[05:45] <ranok> ok
[05:45] <xd45> ok
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> xd45: easier to fix/repair/deal-with
[05:45] <xd45> gotcha thanks
[05:45] <fyrestrtr> and its creator didn't murder his wife.
[05:45] <fyrestrtr> always a bonus.
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> ext3, reiser, xfs all have journaling, but take it one step at a time
[05:46] <xd45> lol
[05:46] <warkruid> dk0r: ok. but not wise. stick to your home directory for making directories
[05:46] <dk0r> warkruid: Ok. I will for now then.
[05:46] <jerp> jrib, ok................ I went and corrected both files in sources.list.d and went sudo apt-get update and got the proper response of a scroll of URLs   the last entry was Reading package list..... Done

[05:47] <unimatrix9> i have found an butterfly in ubuntu and no bug, where should i report it?
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> iku_: try the beryl preferences and look at all the options you have enabled
[05:48] <tannerld> is it still a catterpiller?
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> iku_: click on the ruby thing in the taskbar
[05:48] <dk0r> warkruid: And once I'm through with sudo, how do I go back to ~/  ?
[05:48] <warkruid> dk0r: switches the environment to root. You end up in /root directory

[05:49] <bjorn_> Can anyone help me debug my alsa sound device? Where do I start to figure out whats wrong when the mic won't work
[05:49] <dk0r> One more dumb question. If I am in ~/Examples and I want to go back to ~/  is it neccessary to type cd ~/ or is there a shortcut to go up one level in the dir?
[05:49] <jrib> dk0r: cd ..,  but just 'cd' takes you to home
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> dk0r: just 'cd' as a user returns you to ~/
[05:49] <warkruid> dk0r: oops sry. the command must be "exit"
[05:50] <Recon69> Hi all, basic question, I compiled a program, I would like to be able to run it by clicking on it , what do i ned to set?
[05:50] <dk0r> Ok, what if I am in ~/Examples/a/b/c and I want to get to a ?
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> dk0r: cd ../../
[05:50] <dk0r> gotcha.
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> dk0r: ../ means up one
[05:50] <dk0r> Thank you
[05:50] <kuja> Or cd ~/Examples/a
[05:50] <kuja> :)
[05:50] <dk0r> or that!
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> kuja: heh
[05:50] <dk0r> Thanks.
[05:51] <jrib> Recon69: give yourself executable permissions
[05:52] <fyrestrtr> Recon69: chmod a+x /path/to/program/executable
[05:55] <slytherin> Does anyone know what all I need to play mms:// streams in edgy?
[05:56] <Chetic> slytherin, I assume mplayer can do it
[05:56] <Recon69> fyrestrtr : no thats not it, it's already got x permissions for everyone
[05:56] <dk0r> In terminal, how do I copy ~/Desktop/firefox-2.0.tar.gz   to   ~/Desktop/123/
[05:56] <jrib> Recon69: what happens when you run it from a terminal?
[05:56] <Recon69> it runs fine
[05:57] <jrib> !cli > dk0r
[05:57] <slytherin> Chetic: Looks like my dad used to play it flawlessly in dapper since I had mplayer. I thought that Totem in edgy was good enough to play them.
[05:57] <erUSUL> dk0r: cp  ~/Desktop/firefox-2.0.tar.gz  ~/Desktop/123/
[05:57] <jrib> Recon69: what happens when you double click on it?
[05:57] <noex> Can anyone clue me into why I can't see my icons (formatted ins png, svg, icon, icon) in the icon browser window that the Application Launcher produces?
[05:57] <Chetic> slytherin, in my opinion, Totem is garbage
[05:57] <Recon69> jrib: nothing
[05:57] <jrib> Recon69: what does the program do?
[05:57] <Chetic> slytherin, It has never worked for me
[05:58] <slytherin> Chetic: It has improved a lot.
[05:58] <Recon69> jrib: well it's a 3D app
[05:58] <Chetic> slytherin, in the last couple of months?
[05:58] <Random_Transit> hey, does anyone know of a program like Hymn for linux?
[05:58] <Random_Transit> Hymn is used to strip DRM from music purchased on iTunes
[05:58] <Recon69> jrib: It opens a window and draws some stuff
[05:59] <slytherin> Chetic: Yup. :-)
[05:59] <noex> Has anyone had luck with putting their own icons on to a panel through the app launcher?
[05:59] <Chetic> slytherin, I'll check it out
[06:00] <jtf0518> noex, I added a separator applet and that lets me put launcher in it.
[06:01] <noex> Ah, jtf0518, so you haven't been tried putting custom icons on your panel, through the app launcher?
[06:01] <jrib> Recon69: run nautilus in a terminal and see what output you get when you try running it
[06:01] <jtf0518> yes, I have, I have two bash script with custom icons on it right now
[06:02] <noex> Mmm, any ideas why my custom icons might not be showing up in the browse list?
[06:02] <jtf0518> I had to use the xpm icons though
[06:02] <jtf0518> the browse list for gnome applets?
[06:02] <noex> I converted my png into XPM, and it still didn't show up.
[06:03] <lostboyz> hi i was wondering if there is anyone here that has gotten a logitech webcam to work with ubuntu i have had problems for 3 monts and have not found an answer and am about ready to go to another distro
[06:03] <oklolausername> hello?
[06:03] <noex> I am talking about when you add a custom application launcher (ie, shortcut) to your panel, and it allows you to put in a icon.. well.. I don't want to use the default icons.. I have a custom icon. But, it doesn't seem to like it for some reason.
[06:03] <slytherin> oklolausername: hi
[06:03] <rkd> lostboyz: usb webcam?
[06:03] <jtf0518> noex, try copying them to /usr/share/app-install. Worked for me.
[06:03] <wasabi> lostboyz: Make sure the drivers are loaded, done.
[06:04] <lostboyz> rkd yes
[06:04] <Recon69> jrib: tried that, dont get any output
[06:04] <noex> Ah, I will give that a shot!
[06:04] <noex> Be right back
[06:04] <lostboyz> rkd all my drivers are loaded and i can see my webcam but when i send it it does not show up on another computer
[06:04] <superlap> does any one remember the link to the RPM that make the new HP broadcom wireless cards work?
[06:04] <oklolausername> can sum 1 help me?
[06:04] <jrib> Recon69: when you run nautilus in your terminal, does it give you another prompt?
[06:04] <rkd> send it how?
[06:04] <lostboyz> wasabi yes thank you the drivers are loaded
[06:05] <ryanakca> how do you draw a custom trajectory in open office?
[06:05] <ryanakca> how do you draw a custom trajectory in open office impress?
[06:05] <lostboyz> rkd send it to the reciever on amsn or kopete
[06:05] <rkd> lostboyz: send it how?
[06:05] <wasabi> lostboyz: So what's the problem?
[06:05] <aimtrainer> Does anybody here still have gaim 1.xx installed and is willing to paste me his prefs.xml please?
[06:05] <iku_> can anybody tell me why my window titles are flashing? i am on xgl + beryl + twinview. only get it when "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" is turned off
[06:05] <lostboyz> wasabi i am not able to send the cam to a reciever
[06:05] <jtf0518> hang on aimtrainer, let me check on that
[06:05] <superlap> could someone send me the wireless primer again?
[06:06] <rkd> lostboyz: is there any way to try it with ekiga or something to be sure it's not a software or firewall problem?
[06:06] <aimtrainer> thanks jtf0518
[06:06] <lostboyz> rkd do you have amsn? i also have ekiga
[06:06] <Pieter_> hello!
[06:06] <noex> jtf0518: The icons that are already in /usr/share/app-install/icons don't show up in the browse list. Something is very odd here.
[06:06] <Pieter_> i was trying to install compiz (not beryl, its too slow..), but i can't get my title bars to come back :(
[06:07] <Pieter_> on edgy eft
[06:07] <Pieter_> any idea on solutions for that problem?
[06:07] <rkd> lostboyz: it might be better to do it over a LAN, if ou can, to make sure it's not a firewall either
[06:07] <superlap> will someone bot me withthe wireless primer?
[06:07] <lostboyz> rkd how do i do that
[06:07] <jrib> superlap: /msg ubotu wireless
[06:07] <jtf0518> sorry, aimtrainer, I have a different version. No preferences.xml file found.
[06:08] <Laibsch> Tried to upgrade from dapper to ubuntu via /cdrom/cdromupdate.  The install seems to hang now (no more progress for the last 6 hours or so).  Two questions, can I try and fix this with aptitude or should I not do that?  What info should I attach to the bug report?
[06:08] <jtf0518> noex, are you looking for your custom icons when you click on Add to Panel?
[06:08] <rkd> lostboyz: do you have a network where you are, or is it just one computer?
[06:08] <lostboyz> just one computer that is why i asked how i could do that
[06:08] <noex> Yes, when I am trying to browse icons.. off the Launcher Properties screen.
[06:09] <lostboyz> rkd i never had a problem with suse sending the cam
[06:09] <rkd> hmmm
[06:09] <lostboyz> rkd other than software installation incompatabilities
[06:09] <iku_> has nobody any idea?!?
[06:09] <jtf0518> noex, that won't work. Gnome panel-applets are written specifically for the panel and have a little server component. I've been messing with programming and trying to write one and it's not the easiest thing.
[06:09] <rkd> lostboyz: and you can see the webcam picture fine?
[06:10] <lostboyz> yes
[06:10] <noex> Ah, damn them. :)
[06:10] <lostboyz> rkd yes i can when i plug it in but when i send it no one can see it
[06:10] <jtf0518> noex, just add a seperator applet and then drag the program you want into that space. That's what worked for me. Then you can assign it the icon you want from the properties menu with a right click.
[06:10] <noex> jtf0518, hey, thanks for the clue in. I would have spent another day trying to get it to work. The only work-around I have for now, is to drag.. haha.. nice you beat me to it.
[06:11] <noex> jtf0518: Thanks again.
[06:11] <jtf0518> noex, glad to be of assistance.
[06:11] <noex> jtf0518
[06:11] <noex> jtf0518: I just got it working.
[06:11] <jtf0518> cool!
[06:11] <oklolausername> i just installed dday and it dnt work on n e of the doomz with openGL but it does work on the windows3d thing but its not actually in full 3d its just the crappy old fake 3D can someone help me PPLLZZ!!!!
[06:12] <noex> jtf0518: I can't believe I am so dumb. chmod go+r on the icon you cp into /usr/share/pixmaps
[06:12] <lostboyz> rkd any idea?
[06:12] <rkd> lostboyz: in kopete's Settings > Configure > Devices, can you see the webcam picture?
[06:12] <ominiqu> hello. Where can I find the french 'locale'?
[06:12] <jtf0518> noex, yeah sorry I forgot to mention the permissions change when you cp the icons there.
[06:12] <bobbby> hi
[06:12] <lostboyz> no but when i use camorama i can
[06:12] <noex> jtf0518: Then it will show up in your list of icons. But browsing will not work, so you have to cp it into that directory
[06:13] <lostboyz> rkd it says that there is an error opening device in amsn but i can open it fine with camorama
[06:13] <noex> jtf0518: No problem. I am still new, but it's nice to be able to troubleshoot this stuff out. Thanks again!
[06:13] <luisbg> anybody knows a good hosting page to share some rar files? tried rapid share but it's giving load of problems
[06:13] <jtf0518> damn! why won't this coffee cup stay full? brb
[06:13] <rkd> lostboyz: maybe try updating the drivers and/or amsn?
[06:13] <rkd> lostboyz: brb
[06:14] <Dex-Freudii> when trying to uninstall an app with synaptic i get: "/var/cache/apt/archives/partial No such directory"
[06:14] <sapo> hi guys, i lost my grub after installing windows, and now when i try to do a grub-install /dev/sda it says that cant find /dev/sda, the thing is that the last time i did it, i remember that i had to mount my ubuntu partition, chroot to it, then mount my /dev on the chroot, but i cant remember how i am supposed to mount the /dev, could anyone help me please?
[06:14] <Dex-Freudii> but the directory does exist
[06:14] <lostboyz> rkd thank you
[06:14] <Recon69> ok, if i want to let x-term open a file, how to i give x-term permission to run that file?
[06:15] <dk0r> Can someone please discuss with me the following: 'sudo tar -C /opt -zxvf firefox-2.0.tar.gz'   I do not understand -C and -zxvf
[06:15] <xd45> hmm, anyone know how to save all of the email I have saved locally in evolution for backup?
[06:15] <roryy> dk0r: -C means that the archive will be extracted into /opt
[06:16] <LjL> dk0r: have you tried "man tar"? it discusses those options
[06:16] <marltu> how to open ssh login on my server?
[06:16] <roryy> dk0r: and -zxvf means, in order, decompress, extract, be verbose and use the following file
[06:16] <Dex-Freudii> when trying to uninstall an app with synaptic i get: "/var/cache/apt/archives/partial No such directory"  but the directory does exist
[06:16] <warkruid> dk0r: -xvzf unpacks the tar file
[06:16] <fyrestrtr> dk0r: -C (change directory) -z gunzip, -x extract, -v verbose (show output) -f extract from a file
[06:16] <marltu> *box :)
[06:16] <roryy> dk0r: indeed, reading 'man tar' is a good idea
[06:16] <dk0r> Will get to reading. Thanks.
[06:17] <mads-> When I do "sudo apt-get install mplayer" it says E: Couldn't find package mplayer.. What is wrong?

[06:17] <fyrestrtr> mads-: enable multiverse
[06:17] <mads-> how do I enable multiverse?
[06:17] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell mads- about multiverse
[06:17] <mads-> I have no GUI
[06:17] <warkruid> dk0r: when searching for something try man -k <subject>

[06:17] <LjL> mads-: there is a CLI procedure described
[06:17] <mads-> thanks guys...
[06:17] <lakcaj> marltu, after installing openssh-server
[06:17] <roryy> what, you have to say *please* to the bot nowadays?
[06:17] <dk0r> warkruid: I dont even know how to search :) But what does -k do ?
[06:18] <LjL> roryy, you don't have to
[06:18] <alecjw> does anyone know how long Updating anthy.dic should take on a pentium with 32mb ram?
[06:18] <roryy> ;)
[06:18] <warkruid> dk0r: stands for keyword
[06:18] <dk0r> warkruid: which man file will have instructions on how to search via command line?
[06:18] <alecjw> does anyone know how long Updating anthy.dic should take on a pentium with 32mb ram?
[06:19] <LjL> dk0r: how to search for what?
[06:19] <dk0r> LjL: anything
[06:19] <jtf0518> alecjw, no idea.
[06:19] <dk0r> LjL: a local file
[06:19] <LjL> dk0r: that's a bit generic. search for books in a library? search for stars in the sky? :P
[06:19] <LjL> dk0r: "man grep"
[06:19] <dk0r> LjL: thank you.
[06:19] <warkruid> dk0r: man locate
[06:19] <Laibsch> Can I upgrade with aptitde from dapper to edgy or is that generally not a good idea?
[06:19] <dk0r> Ok. So two!
[06:20] <ubuntu_newb> not really
[06:20] <ubuntu_newb> you shouldn't upgrade
[06:20] <LjL> dk0r: locate (and "find") search for filenames - grep searches for expressions *inside* given files
[06:20] <ubuntu_newb> just reinstall 6.10
[06:20] <warkruid> dk0r: locate is to search for something in the file system
[06:20] <jtf0518> Laibsch, from what I've read the clean install is the best. Many have had probs doing it the dist way. But some have had success.
[06:20] <warkruid> dk0r: grep is to search for something in files
[06:20] <lostboyz> how do you force the installation of a deb i386 package on a amd 64 machine
[06:21] <jerp> when the bug report site asked for a package, what does that mean?  ie. the install version ie edgy 6.10?
[06:21] <dk0r> warkruid: thanks. Is there a way to minimize all windows in default ubuntu desktop ?
[06:21] <LjL> jerp: no, it's asking for which package causes the problem
[06:21] <dk0r> There must be a button or something right? The windows equivalent of 'Show Desktop'
[06:21] <jrib> jerp: gnome-app-install would be a good choice
[06:21] <LjL> dk0r: indeed there is
[06:21] <jerp> ok, mine would be terminal apt-get
[06:21] <warkruid> dkor: try icon below left
[06:21] <jerp> oh
[06:21] <jtf0518> dk0r, there is in the lower left corner of your bottom panel by default.
[06:22] <jrib> jerp: the comments in that file said the line was added by gnome-app-install so i would blame that
[06:22] <dk0r> Thank you.
[06:22] <jtf0518> dk0r, stop doing that! you'll hurt yourself! :-)
[06:22] <jerp> jrib alright
[06:23] <jtf0518> ahhhh, coffee's done!
[06:23] <TLE> uhmmm coofee
[06:24] <dk0r> Hey look @ that. On the right there are multiple work spaces. Thats a bad mother!! I wonder if theres a keyboard shortcut for scrolling between them? And if someone knows it, and its not convenient for me, what the entry would be called under Sys>Pref>Keyboard Shortcuts to modify it
[06:24] <Laibsch> jtf0518: Thank you for the reply.  What do you mean, the clean way?  update-manager?  That just broke horribly on me.
[06:24] <LjL> Laibsch, he meant installing from scratch
[06:24] <dk0r> Nevermind.
[06:25] <Laibsch> LjL: You gotta be kidding?  Is this windows?
[06:25] <jerp> jrib, thanks again,  see yll later.
[06:25] <jrib> jerp: cya
[06:25] <ravenlord> can somebody please help me? i've got a problem with anjuta 2.0.2 on edgy
[06:25] <Laibsch> First upgrade for me and ubuntu bails out like that?
[06:25] <jtf0518> Laibsch, no I meant a complete fresh install from CD
[06:25] <Laibsch> :-/
[06:26] <Nikolas> Anjuta 2.0.2 on Edgy is an epic fail
[06:26] <LjL> Laibsch, i've just rephrased what he said, don't kill the messenger. but, i hear that update-manager does easily break if you have any non-official repositories enabled or non-official packages installed
[06:26] <ravenlord> the scintilla editor crashes whenever i try to use it
[06:26] <Laibsch> I can't believe this.
[06:26] <ravenlord> ouch...i've realised that
[06:26] <jtf0518> Nikolas, I've been reading about that.
[06:26] <ravenlord> ;))
[06:26] <Nikolas> I built anjuta 1.2.4a from source because 2.0.2 just didn't work
[06:26] <Chetic> What the hell is wrong with the Ubuntu install CD's?
[06:26] <jtf0518> I've been trying to get WxPython but starship site is down.
[06:26] <Chetic> Why can it never start X?
=== mathrick|sleep is now known as mathrick
[06:26] <Laibsch> LjL: I did not mean to sound harsh.  Was just very surprised since I did not expect this with a fine Linux distro.  I always thought ubuntu was a fine Linux distro ...
[06:27] <Laibsch> LjL: apologies.
[06:27] <LjL> Chetic: "never" is such a strong word, X starts fine for me
[06:27] <ravenlord> aha...well...thanks for the tip:P
[06:27] <Chetic> Not for me
[06:27] <jrib> jtf0518: isn't wxpython in the repositories?
[06:27] <lnxtech> If I want use the latest version of alsa (compiled from source) would I need to remove anything else from edgy besides the alsa-* packages and libasound2 (I think alsa-libs provides the same libs)?
[06:27] <Chetic> I am getting seriously pissed off
[06:27] <jtf0518> Laibsch, Dapper is a fine distro. Edgy is meant to be experimental, new kernel, new X-server, lots of new stuff.
[06:27] <TLE> Chetic: Does ot lock up to the point where you can't even get to a terminal ?
[06:27] <Chetic> TLE, It gives me the error message saying no devices detected
[06:28] <kuja> How do I make GNOME stop automounting my USB devices?
[06:28] <Laibsch> jtf0518: edgy was officially released.  I would not have tried it out otherwise.
[06:28] <LjL> Laibsch, when you start enabling third party repositories or installing stuff in weird ways, you need to be aware that things are likely to break.  now i don't even know if this really is the case for you - it might just be that update-manager does have a bug
[06:28] <Chetic> "(EE) No devices detected."
[06:28] <TLE> Chetic: Do you have an ATI card ?
[06:28] <rkd> lostboyz: back
[06:28] <Chetic> TLE, Yes
[06:28] <rkd> lostboyz: any luck yet?
[06:28] <jtf0518> I've never taken an official release to automatically mean "stable" but then I've been dealing with Windows since version 3.0 :-)
[06:28] <LjL> jtf0518, that's untrue. Dapper has longer support, but Edgy is not "meant to be experimental" by any stretch of imagination. it was released last month. it was experimental before that.
[06:29] <angrylinuxgeek> what is the preferred method of setting up services in Ubuntu? I want Samba to start when I start the computer. In debian, I used rcconf. but samba doesn't show up in RCCONF on Ubuntu
[06:29] <iku_> can anybody tell me why my window titles are flashing? i am on xgl + beryl + twinview. only get it when "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" is turned off
[06:29] <Laibsch> jtf0518: I use computer even longer than that.  And I thought I left this mess behind with Linux.  I cannot remember Debian breaking so badly.
[06:29] <wasabi> iku_: beryl bug
[06:29] <LjL> angrylinuxgeek, once you have samba installed, i think it should start by default
[06:29] <TLE> Chetic: Well, I was struck by a bug myself which prevented me from booting the livecd, but I don't think it's the same thing
[06:29] <Chetic> TLE, Tell me about it..
[06:30] <TLE> Chetic: can you boot it in safe graphics mode ?
[06:30] <Chetic> TLE, No..
[06:30] <iku_> wasabi: is there a workaround you know of?
[06:30] <dk0r> Is it possible to set a group of application windows to the shaded state instead of having to set each one individually?
[06:30] <LjL> angrylinuxgeek: perhaps look in /etc/default if there's a file about samba that disables it by default... just a guess though, i've never used samba on ubuntu
[06:30] <jtf0518> Laibsch, there seems to be some disagreement in the Ubuntu community as to whether Edgy is stable or not. Lots of arguements and many hardcore defenders.
[06:30] <Laibsch> I c.
[06:30] <TehUni> <-- stable as a rock on edgy
[06:31] <adam_> im stable too
[06:31] <Laibsch> I think I will try aptitude and wait with my work machine.
[06:31] <adam_> notebook pounding away
[06:31] <TehUni> though...
[06:31] <Laibsch> TehUni: Did you upgrade?
[06:31] <adam_> wireless, acpi, all of it
[06:31] <jtf0518> TehUni, lucky you and lucky me on my other box.
[06:31] <defrysk> egdy = stable here
[06:31] <TLE> Chetic: Do you know if your ATI card works with the opensource "ati" driver ?
[06:31] <lostboyz> rkd no i dunno how to reconfigure the drivers and i was wondering why it would be a driver problem if i can see my cam in camorama and it turns on when i plug it in?
[06:31] <TehUni> my upgrade tanked, though. heh
[06:31] <dk0r> Is there a way to set a group of application windows to the shaded state instead of having to set each one individually?
[06:31] <mads-> How can I turn the volume up in Command line?
[06:31] <TehUni> fresh install is sturdy.
[06:31] <warkruid> some crashes with firefox
[06:31] <Phenax> mads-: alsamixer or amixer
[06:31] <LjL> jtf0518, it might not be very stable, it might have problems, and whatnot. but this is the official support channel, and Edgy wasn't released, and as such it's not experimental anymore, and saying otherwise is simply wrong. saying "it's unstable for some people" is different from saying "it's meant to be experimental"
[06:31] <rkd> lostboyz: what's camorama?
[06:31] <warkruid> fixed though
[06:31] <Laibsch> TehUni: "my upgrade tanked"  And you call that stable? LMAO
[06:32] <Chetic> TLE, No idea... Definitely doesn't look like it though because that's what's failing..
[06:32] <jtf0518> but not lucky for everyone. I expect it will be different in less than six months time as the developers seem to work like the devil on this stuff.
[06:32] <lostboyz> it is a webcam viewer and image manipulator
[06:32] <Laibsch> TehUni: That is windows think.  Ubuntu can do better.
[06:32] <LjL> besides, you get everyone chirping in and saying whether it's stable or not for them, as you can see
[06:32] <TehUni> Laibsch: but the fresh install is sturdy. heh
[06:33] <TLE> Chetic: Ok then maybe this will work for you, hold on while I'm finding the info
[06:33] <adam_> hey, i am installing edgy on my second notebook, and i am wondering if there is out of the box support for the ati 320 chipset?
[06:33] <Laibsch> TehUni: Windows is sturdy after initial installation ;-)
[06:33] <adam_> windows is never sturdy
[06:33] <adam_> not even vista
[06:33] <adam_> junk i say... junk
[06:33] <TehUni> heh
[06:33] <TehUni> installing vista today.. i'll let you know
[06:33] <jtf0518> I usually don't consider any Windows release stable until the second service pack except in the case of Win2K which was SP3
[06:34] <defrysk> it this #ubuntu-ot ?
[06:34] <TehUni> yup. agreed.
[06:34] <TehUni> heh
[06:34] <LjL> defrysk: i'm starting to think so

[06:37] <nolimitsoya> *insert
[06:37] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, I am but I feel it is not reading it
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> adam_, ctrl+alt+f2
[06:37] <defrysk> adam_, usually setting it to vesa in xorg.conf does the trick
[06:37] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, I am inserting audio disks but the disk isn't showing up
[06:37] <Poromenos> what package is gconf-schemas part of?
[06:37] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , have you tried browsing it?
[06:37] <lostboyz> when i try to send my webcam the reciever is not able to see it eventhough i can see my cam in camorama any advice?
[06:37] <adam_> i need to create a user...
[06:38] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, how do I do that? It doesn't seem to be mounted
[06:38] <adam_> !user
[06:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about user - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:38] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , just try tobrowse the contents in you file manager
[06:38] <adam_> I didnt create a user on this notebook, how do i do so?
[06:38] <TLE> Chetic: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/67487 Look at the post from Tormod Volden at 2006-11-05 16:31:36 CET. Are you familiar with editing the xorg.xonf ?
[06:38] <adam_> in cmd line
[06:38] <nolimitsoya> adam_, system -> users and groups
[06:38] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, nothing shows up
[06:38] <adam_> i dont have a gui
[06:39] <Chetic> Yeah TLE, more than familiar.. heheh..
[06:39] <adam_> need to edit xorg
[06:39] <Chetic> TLE, I gotta run though, be back in 30 minutes. later
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , mount -l <- in terminal
[06:39] <java1> is there an newbie chat room for ubuntu?
[06:39] <adam_> cmd for user creation?
[06:39] <defrysk> adam_, man useradd | less
[06:39] <nolimitsoya> java1, this would be it...
[06:39] <java1> ok
[06:39] <bthornton> My monitor is not refreshing at an optimal rate by default, and I know I need a modeline to force it to... does anybody know of any modeline generators that will autodetect my monitor and create modelines?
[06:39] <adam_> ok, so what is default root pwd?
[06:39] <adam_> so i can get in
[06:39] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, alright, what do I do with the data it gave me?
[06:40] <ifireball> defrysk: no need for the "| less" part man sends text through a pager by default
[06:40] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin | [erisco] 
[06:40] <ubotu> [erisco] : pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[06:40] <ifireball> adam_: boot the system in recovery mode, then creat user, theb reboot
[06:40] <nolimitsoya> adam_, the default root password is random created at boot
[06:40] <defrysk> adam_, in livecd default sudo is <enter>
[06:40] <adam_> ah

[06:41] <caveMan> can I install some 3d game using opengl via apt-get? I need it for testing purposes
[06:41] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , sudo mount /media/cdrom0

[06:41] <fishsticks> caveMan, i believe there is billardsGL that will help
=== eracc_ is now known as eracc
[06:42] <nolimitsoya> caveMan, sudo apt-get install brutalchess
[06:42] <defrysk> caveMan, try tuxracer
[06:42] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, "mount: No medium found"
[06:42] <adam_> now, i have to find a way to get the gui running, the whole reason i am installing is to check the drivers from windows, its not my notebook...
[06:42] <caveMan> thanks guys
[06:42] <jtf0518> Yog, a Lovecraft fan are we?
[06:42] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, I had gotten that last time when I tried to mount it *shrug* am I missing drivers?
[06:42] <ifireball> caveMan: if you just want a 3D app you can try glxgears or anything in /usr/lib/xscreensaver
[06:42] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , hm... thats strange. eject the cd, and reinsert it. check fstab if theres an entry for cdrom
[06:43] <wildchild> does anyone here uses terminatorx; I can't set up audio device ?

[06:44] <adam_> ok, so man useradd
[06:44] <adam_> then what adam?
[06:44] <Random_Transit> can i set a root password in ubuntu with passwd?
[06:44] <ifireball> _JP: you don't, really, I mean it, its teoreticaly possible in limited amount of cases, but trying that can really damage your system
[06:44] <cello_rasp> is nautilus slow for everyone or just me?
[06:45] <CruCiaL> can anyone help me setup an internet connection through wlan? pls im lost :-(
[06:45] <ifireball> cello_rasp: just you :P
[06:45] <Megaqwerty> what is the "chmod" command to make a file read/write/execute for any user?
[06:45] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, I have tried to mount "/dev/hdc" and "/media/cdrom0" with the same success, bleh
[06:45] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , did you eject manualy, or by rightclicking the icon on the desktop? anyway, try sudo umount /dev/hdc && sudo mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0
[06:45] <adam_> x is crashing... cant get it to load
[06:45] <ifireball> MegaQuark_: chmod 777 <file>; use with caution
[06:46] <Carolinamusicman> Nautilus isnt slow for me cello_rasp  and Im running it on an older PC
[06:46] <CruCiaL> can anyone help me setup an internet connection through wlan? pls im lost :-(
[06:46] <nolimitsoya> Megaqwerty, +x
[06:46] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: why do you say that?
[06:46] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, I physically depressed the eject button on the physical drive on my physical tower, I swear ;) I will try unmounting, just a second
[06:46] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , thats what not to do ;) eject using software
[06:46] <Megaqwerty> (and it's "qwerty" not "quark")
[06:47] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: becase on most cases that way too many permissions, expeically when granting both write and execute
[06:47] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, "umount: /dev/hdc: not mounted"
[06:47] <wildchild> does anyone here uses terminatorx; I can't set up audio device ?
[06:47] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, well there is one thing confirmed, it was never mounted. Alright, so lets try ejecting with software
[06:47] <sandy16> how to  record audio in ubuntu using line-in input
[06:47] <adam_> ifireball, what is the cmd to create a user? i have typed man useradd adam and it puts me in a menu
[06:47] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: yeah, noticed that, I do that alot lately
[06:47] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: oh, well this is for a friend who is trying to install linux on a TungstenT so I'm sure it's of no issue.
[06:47] <Megaqwerty> sok
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> adam_, man useradd shouldgive you a manual
[06:48] <eNonsense> having a problem.  serpentine keeps crashing midway through a burn, so I'm trying to use K3B but it's telling me "Unable to handle files do to an unsupported format" when I try to add an mp3 to the burn list.
[06:48] <adam_> nolimitsoya, it did
[06:48] <adam_> but i dont know how to get out of it
[06:48] <jrib> adam_: use 'adduser'
[06:48] <ifireball> adam_: adam_ the command is "useradd", typing "man useradd" will show you the instructions of how to use it
[06:48] <jtf0518> adam, you're in the manual. to add a user just type useradd -m "username"
[06:48] <nolimitsoya> adam_, man adduser <-read what it says, then press ctrl+q to exit
[06:48] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, is there a terminal command to eject the disk? I tried with the CD ripper, ejected, pushed it back in, reread the CD and still not mounting
[06:49] <epimer> hi guys
[06:49] <ifireball> [erisco] : simple, "eject"
[06:49] <sandy16> can any body help me ... to record audio using line in
[06:49] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , eject /dev/hdc
[06:49] <epimer> does GAIM support webcams at all?
[06:49] <adam_> nolimitsoya, thanks now i have to edit xorg to work with my ati...
[06:49] <eNonsense> having a problem.  serpentine keeps crashing midway through a burn, so I'm trying to use K3B but it's telling me "Unable to handle files do to an unsupported format" when I try to add an mp3 to the burn list.
[06:49] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, not a way to put it back in is there? heh
[06:50] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , i dont know of any :)
[06:50] <adam_> so how do i edit the x file?
[06:50] <adam_> is it gksudo edit xorg?
[06:50] <jtf0518> eNonsense, it's most likely a DRM protected file causing that.
[06:50] <jtf0518> sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:50] <ifireball> [erisco] : actually you can with "eject -t"
[06:50] <Noah0504> epimer: Not without a little help.  You might want to look at Gaim-vv.
[06:50] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, unfortunately it isn't mounting still. I did rip a CD not long ago though...
[06:50] <eNonsense> jtf0518, nope.  it's actually a bunch of music that i ripped from vinyl records myself.
[06:51] <adam_> jtf0518, not it... getting a error
[06:51] <revolution> I need help for sound problem with ICH7 chipset
[06:51] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , is it a red book cd, or a protected one?
=== james is now known as Daylighter
[06:51] <ifireball> [erisco] : I think that perticualr CD may be fuged
[06:51] <boricua> how can i install the dansguardian gui in the ubuntu -CE  to regular ubuntu
[06:51] <Daylighter> anyone here know anything about beryl?
[06:51] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, ifireball, I have tried all my audio CD's (not many) and none will mount. They are all commercial CD's, but they are older classical disks
[06:51] <nolimitsoya> boricua, apt-get?
[06:51] <revolution> it work fine but when i touch volume control, sound it's gone
[06:51] <epimer> Noah0504, ty
[06:52] <boricua> what it is called?
[06:52] <adam_> ok, using the cd, can i get drivers for the ati?
[06:52] <Noah0504> epimer: No problem.
[06:52] <adam_> if so, is it sudo apt-get install fglrx?
[06:52] <epimer> that seems odd to me - i just tried aMSN, which strikes me as a horrible program, and i don't get why it can manage webcams and GAIM, a more fully-featured client, doesn't
[06:52] <ifireball> [erisco] : oh.. you can't mount an Audio CD is doesn't contain a filesystem... yuo just play it with a CD player...
[06:52] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, the one I was able to mount was a burnt CD. Many these are protected
[06:52] <jtf0518> adam, do a ls -ao /etc/X11/ and look to see if you have an xorg.conf file to begin with. It might have gotten munged.
[06:52] <Daylighter>  /j #ubuntu-agx
[06:52] <Daylighter> oops
[06:52] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , then they might notmount at all :) try a cd thats red book
[06:53] <ifireball> [erisco] : or rip it...
[06:53] <Daylighter> i'm trying to remember what channel it is that has all the glx people
[06:53] <adam_> yep got xorg
[06:53] <Daylighter> -_-
[06:53] <adam_> jtf0518, yep got it
[06:53] <[erisco] > ifireball, that is EXACTLY what I am trying to do =\ it won't read the disk
[06:53] <compilerwriter> Anyone know how to prioritize tasks in evolution?
[06:54] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, apart from being related to properties of the CD, what is "Red book"?
[06:54] <epimer> Noah0504, i can't find gaim-w on google - do you have a link?
[06:54] <ifireball> [erisco] : what are you trying to use to rip?
[06:54] <jtf0518> adam, sorry I forgot you're stuck in CLI mode. Try sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:54] <[erisco] > ifireball, sound juicer
[06:54] <jtf0518> I love sound juicer
[06:54] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , thats the standard for audio cd:s. protected cd:s are not real cd:s.
[06:54] <Megaqwerty> my friend was working on a TungstenT Palm trying to get Linux on it, and he said "
[06:54] <Megaqwerty> I tried parted but then I had issues with root owning the device and I couldn't change that. When I logged in as root and tried changing it,it said that even I couldn't. As root. Eh?"
[06:54] <Noah0504> epimer: http://gaim-vv.sourceforge.net/
[06:54] <adam_> ok, what do i do to edit this so i can get my ati rollin?
[06:55] <Megaqwerty> Any Ideas on how he would fix this?
[06:55] <ProN00b> my gstreamer seems to have problems viewing normal mpeg1 or mpeg2 videos, any idea why ? (i installed most plugins from universe for it)
[06:55] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, these CD's may in fact be protected. They are commercial, bah. Limewire time? :P
[06:55] <ifireball> [erisco] : I see, well, 1st, mounting has nothing to do with ripping, 2nd, like nolimitsoya said, if its protected you're pretty much out of luck
[06:55] <adam_> !ati
[06:55] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:55] <hume> i have problems playing webtv from svt.se - using either mozilla-mplayer or the firefox mediaplayer plugin. Anyone that can play http://svt.se/svt/road/Classic/shared/mediacenter/player.jsp?d=59620&a=698481
[06:55] <hume> ?
[06:56] <jtf0518> adam, if you don't know what changes you need to make just close the file and try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it'll run a config program to walk you through picking your video card, resolution, mouse and keyboard etc.
[06:56] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , if its one of those with a visible data layer in the perimeter you can try puting a tiny bit of opaque tape over that section :)
[06:56] <action09> hi anyone know how to change keyboard an language settings please ?
[06:56] <jtf0518> adam, it'll also try to detect your hardware for you.
[06:56] <[erisco] > ifireball, nolimitsoya, alright thanks for your help. Two new things learnt! Ripping doesn't require mounting, and protected CD's screw you over. heh
[06:57] <ifireball> nolimitsoya: now thats pushing it...
[06:57] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, hrm, well no not that I can see =\
[06:57] <Megaqwerty> action09: Keyboard settings are in System>Preferences>Keyboard
[06:57] <nolimitsoya> ifireball, why do you think that?
[06:57] <topyli> hume: i can play the windows media stream with the totem-xine plugin
[06:57] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: Do you know how my friend's problem could be fixed? ^^
[06:57] <ifireball> nolimitsoya: smell like one of those things that are never going to work
[06:58] <hume> topyli, ok
[06:58] <Daylighter> I get an error " compwiz - no composite extension" when I try to start beryl
[06:58] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: would chmod'ing the SD drive to 777 fix it?
[06:58] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: sorry, I wasn't paying attention, what problem?
[06:58] <[erisco] > ifireball, nolimitsoya, reminded me of the red green show ;)
[06:58] <mumbles-potpal> do i use "dd" to backup a windows install ?
[06:58] <Megaqwerty> (09:54:46 AM) Megaqwerty: my friend was working on a TungstenT Palm trying to get Linux on it, and he said "
[06:58] <Megaqwerty> (09:54:46 AM) Megaqwerty: I tried parted but then I had issues with root owning the device and I couldn't change that. When I logged in as root and tried changing it,it said that even I couldn't. As root. Eh?"
[06:58] <topyli> hume: the real stream looks better. it seems to open a standalone totem
[06:58] <nolimitsoya> ifireball, it does. the data layer just tells your drive its an empty cd; normal sound equipment cant understand that data, and therefore work fine. breaking that data with some tape makes the cd usable
[06:58] <CruCiaL> can anyone help me setup an internet connection through wlan? pls im lost :-(
[06:58] <CruCiaL> can anyone help me setup an internet connection through wlan? pls im lost :-(
[06:59] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Have you tried the network-manager-gnome?
[06:59] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , you could try using eac, or some other advanced ripping software
[06:59] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, well there must be a way to override the data layer
[06:59] <topyli> hume: gotta love our national broadcasting companies. svt is one of them, right? like the BBC and YLE in finland?
[06:59] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: partitioning is one of those taskes reserved for root. don't try to override that. am I not getting the problem here?
[07:00] <hume> topyli, my totem didnt want to open, so I changed to mplayer..
[07:00] <CruCiaL> i dont know where to find network manager - im kinda new to this! ;-)
[07:00] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, can I get that out of apt-get?
[07:00] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: I'm going to send you his full question.
[07:00] <nolimitsoya> [erisco] , no
[07:00] <coz_> CruCiaL, Syste/Administration/network
[07:00] <ifireball> nolimitsoya: its quite possible you'll tape over more then the data layer...
[07:00] <coz_> CruCiaL, system
[07:00] <topyli> hume: totem-gstreamer or totem-xine?
[07:01] <coz_> topyli, totem xine
[07:01] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: ok
[07:01] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, ah well no problem. I have the song names, I own the CD's, I will just download them *shrug*
[07:01] <hume> topyli, removed both
[07:01] <nolimitsoya> ifireball, there is a visible border between the sections, but yes, a magnifying glass and good lighting is recommended
[07:01] <CruCiaL> coz_: ive been to that, it says that wlan0 is active, it finds my homehub, but when i goto firefox, it wont load pages as if no connection
[07:01] <[erisco] > nolimitsoya, always more than one way around a problem :)
[07:01] <topyli> hume: well, totem-xine with libxine-extracodecs and w32codecs seems to play pretty much what you give them
[07:01] <adam_> ok, the driver seems to be working now, but how do i configure an lcd?
[07:02] <coz_> CruCiaL, what wireless card do you hae
[07:02] <adam_> it started x, but i cant see it
[07:02] <CruCiaL> coz_: its a cable and wireless usb stick, im running it on a laptop
[07:02] <ifireball> nolimitsoya: also I wonder if the drive will just skip over the rapde section or whill it choke on it and claim the CD is faulty
[07:02] <jtf0518> adam, what's the problem with the LCD?
[07:02] <coz_> CruCiaL, what manufactureer for the wireless stick
[07:02] <boricua> does anyone know what app is this gui for ubuntu http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/christianubuntu/uploaded_images/configure_parental_controls_screen-745707.png
[07:03] <ifireball> nolimitsoya: I mean "taped section"
[07:03] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: You need to download the network-manager-gnome from the Synaptic Package Manager
[07:03] <boricua> i am using regular edgy edition
[07:03] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Do you know how to use it?
[07:03] <jtf0518> boricua, Ubuntu uses Gnome as default for gui
[07:03] <adam_> jtf0518, it just isnt showing anything... xstarted...
[07:03] <ryanakca> how do you draw a custom trajectory in open office impress?
=== james is now known as Daylighter
[07:03] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: did you get my message?
[07:03] <boricua> jtf0518, this is a gui to maintain dansguardian and i dont see it in the regular edgy
[07:04] <coz_> CruCiaL, in terminal type iwconfig
[07:04] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: how do i download it, i dont have a connection, only in ms windows
[07:04] <jtf0518> boricua, it's not in the "regular" Edgy. Only Ubuntu CE
[07:04] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Do you have an Ethernet Cable?
[07:04] <ifireball> Megaqwerty: nope, where did you send it to?
[07:04] <compengi> LjL: there?
[07:04] <boricua> jtf0518, :-(
[07:04] <Megaqwerty> ifireball: I'll try it again, just a second
[07:04] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: no,
[07:05] <coz_> CruCiaL, in terminal typ iwconfig tell me what you see
[07:05] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I'll find it for you, just a second.
[07:05] <jtf0518> adam, when you ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, did it correctly identify your monitor?
[07:05] <adam_> jtf0518, no it says generic
[07:06] <adam_> jtf0518, i know that is why, but i dont know how to tell it what to use
[07:06] <coz_> CruCiaL, in the net work window did you set you essid and dhcp
[07:06] <CruCiaL> coz_: i cant really do that just yet as i am on my laptop, dual boot - windows and ubuntu,
[07:06] <jtf0518> do you have the specs for your monitor?
[07:06] <coz_> CruCiaL, no guy go to applications accessories and terminal
[07:06] <adam_> jtf0518, no, its a laptop
[07:06] <Stormx2> I need some screen recording software, ideally with microphone support. Suggestions?
[07:06] <MarcN> Stormx2: audacity?
[07:07] <MarcN> oh, sorry, not that.
[07:07] <coz_> CruCiaL, i see  you are on windows right now
[07:07] <CruCiaL> coz_: i did see essid and dhcp, the essid and it says BTHomeHub-cc60
[07:07] <unimatrix9> dont know about microphone  support, but wink works well for just screen capture in flash
[07:07] <jtf0518> adam, I'd go on the ubuntu web forums and search the threads there. You'll end up needing  to manuall add info to your xorg.conf file and you'll find examples there that will help you understand how it's done.
[07:07] <MarcN> Stormx2: google for 'recordmydesktop'
[07:08] <coz_> CruCiaL, what are you on now with the internet
[07:08] <Stormx2> MarcN: I tried that
[07:08] <Stormx2> MarcN: It screws up the audio, skips LOADS
[07:08] <jtf0518> adam, try to find info on your max resolution from the laptop manufacturer's website too.
[07:08] <CruCiaL> coz_: im on windows xp pro
[07:08] <CruCiaL> coz: its using the usb adapter
[07:08] <buzzbuzz> does anyone know if edgy supports WPA2? i have an ath0 in a sony vaio and it doesn't like any wpa enabled ap, any thoughts?
[07:08] <napkin> can anyone recommend a text editor with basic formatting, suitable for writing notes, similar to ms wordpad or apple textedit?
[07:09] <coz_> CruCiaL, ok well all you need is where I told you to go in the first place and you have to have a valid essid to put in there but you also need the driver for the usb stick you have
[07:09] <jtf0518> napkin, it's called Tomboy
[07:09] <MarcN> Stormx2: skips what?  I had good luck with it on dapper (not tried since upgraded to edgy)
[07:09] <tigerspirit> Bonjour, messieurs.  I have a problem with FF2 on Breezy Badger.  I installed FF2, and it *partly* overwrote my installation of FF1.5.0.1.  Now I can't install add-ons because if I install ones for FF2, I get an error saying not compatible with 1.5etc, if I install ones for 1.5 etce, I get an error saying not compatible with 2.  I've spent yonks on chat sites and bugging my local LUG.  The...
[07:09] <tigerspirit> ...consensus is that this is a result of the way Ubuntu installs packages.  So, can you tell me how to get all parts of FF to tell the world it is 2.0?  Or point me to a URL that will?  Merci.
[07:09] <CruCiaL> coz: where can i get a driver, i have a driver cd but its for windows
[07:09] <napkin> jtf0518: thanks, i'll check that out.
[07:09] <jerp> Since the Adobe site doesn tell the user; does anyone know how to add a flashplayer to an amd64 system?  (Ie attempted to add the flashplayer 7 version but I get the error window wont install due to system architecture)
[07:10] <CokeNCode> hey
[07:10] <Efdar> LOL http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/3466/mrnuggetfc9.png
[07:10] <jtf0518> napkin, you're welcome.
[07:10] <coz_> CruCiaL, right, well that is why I need to know the manufacturer of the usb stick and its version number if you have it
[07:10] <IndyBC> I tried to install glade with apt-get but it said me that it is already at the latest version. I typed "glade" at the terminal but it said "no such command" etc. How do I run glade?
[07:10] <CruCiaL> coz: 1sec
[07:10] <CokeNCode> hey, is it possible to write a shell script to delete every process that isn't run by root ?
[07:10] <CokeNCode> and logout all users other than root ?
[07:10] <ifireball> CokeNCode: yes, but why?
[07:10] <coz_> CokeNCode, there is a small utility to so that with
[07:10] <adam_> jtf0518, i found some docs...
[07:10] <Stormx2> MarcN: Well, it records waay fast.
[07:10] <MarcN> CokeNCode: look at 'killall -u '
[07:11] <Enselic> !mono
[07:11] <ubotu> mono: Mono CLI (.NET) runtime. In component main, is optional. Version 1.1.17.1-1ubuntu7 (edgy), package size 1 kB, installed size 24 kB
[07:11] <Stormx2> MarcN: Like, the video is sped up when I view the .ogg
[07:11] <MarcN> Stormx2: let me try it again
[07:11] <coz_> CruCiaL, lsec is the manufacturer or did you mean one sec?
[07:11] <Stormx2> MarcN: And the audio skips to make up for it.
[07:11] <CokeNCode> ifireball, trying to automate something we do on the servers at work
[07:11] <CokeNCode> thanks MarcN
[07:11] <Enselic> Does anyone know when the mono 1.2 ubuntu package will be released?
[07:11] <ifireball> CokeNCode: also, isn't simly shutting-down to single user mode serve your purpose better?
[07:11] <CokeNCode> ifireball, no
[07:12] <CokeNCode> i just need to log everyone out of the system to unlock the databases
[07:12] <CokeNCode> and once that's done
[07:12] <FN> Hi all... I'm from India and wondering if anyone knows how to get a ZTE datacard working on Ubuntu 6.10 with the Reliance service from here. Thanks in advance.
[07:12] <CokeNCode> everyonecan go back in
[07:12] <CruCiaL> coz: i meant one sec, its a cable and wireless 802.11g usb adapter, my windows driver is XPC 802.11g v4.7.0.0
[07:12] <CokeNCode> and sometimes ppl go in .. .and hang up
[07:12] <coz_> CokeNCode, I don't have script just utility to shut of processes on each machine
[07:12] <CokeNCode> and don't exit properly
[07:12] <CokeNCode> so they're processes running
[07:12] <coz_> oh
[07:12] <MarcN> Stormx2: works fine for me
[07:12] <CokeNCode> on the server
[07:12] <Nutubuntu> Hello all - Synaptic displays error messages during the installation/config of clamav: "configuration error - unknown item 'QUOTAS_ENAB' (notify administrator)" and four more. Is this a problem? I've looked at the clamav website but not found it there.
[07:12] <adam_> jtf0518, kinda a pain in the a55 since i am not leaving this thing on ubuntu.. i wanted to just test the drivers on the notebook...
[07:12] <Stormx2> MarcN: OK thats great.
[07:12] <Stormx2> MarcN: Now I want it to work for me.
[07:13] <tigerspirit> quit
[07:13] <Enselic> How long does it usually takes between a release of lib/program X and an Ubuntu package created based on that release?
[07:13] <MarcN> Stormx2: recordMyDesktop v0.2.3
[07:13] <CruCiaL> coz: thats all it says, manufacturer is cable & wireless
[07:13] <jutty> so i went to sleep last night, woke up and everything was gone my desktop couldnt find anything
[07:13] <coz_> CruCiaL, you still there?
[07:13] <unimatrix9> _Genrl_Zo
[07:13] <jutty> so i restarted my computer
[07:13] <CokeNCode> can killall -u be run in such a way that says ... everything EXCEPT user 'root' ?
[07:13] <jtf0518> adam, it can be a pain. It took me over 8 hours of fiddlin to get my widescreen monitor working right.
[07:13] <crossbar> first time installing ubuntu and it never asked me for a root password.. whats the default root password? i had to install it from the GUI cause the regular start and install locked up.
[07:13] <jutty> "operating system couldnt be found"
[07:13] <CokeNCode> or am i gonna have ot list EVERY other user
[07:13] <jutty> WHAT?!!?!?!
[07:13] <CruCiaL> coz: thats all it says, manufacturer is cable & wireless
[07:13] <unimatrix9> _Genrl_Zo how did it go?
[07:13] <Stormx2> jutty: pwnt
[07:13] <ifireball> CokeNCode: you can list user currently connected with "who"
[07:14] <jutty> YEAH BUT HOW
[07:14] <jutty> its ubuntu
[07:14] <coz_> CruCiaL, sorry must have missed it what is it again?
[07:14] <adam_> jtf0518, well, the issue is that when i boot to windows, i get dashes across the monitor, so i download new drivers, and it doesnt change.
[07:14] <CokeNCode> like ... killall -u everyone execpt root
[07:14] <CokeNCode> is there a command that can do that ?
[07:14] <adam_> jtf0518, the next thing i did was pull it apart and check the connections, and it looks fine..
[07:14] <ifireball> CokeNCode: also, won't disabling new logins and w8ing a little while for existing ones to be disconnected more user-friendly
[07:14] <adam_> jtf0518, its a laptop, so there is only so much i can do
[07:15] <coz_> CruCiaL, missed the posting for what it said tell me again so I can check for driver
[07:15] <CokeNCode> ifireball, nah ... things need to be done at a particular time
[07:15] <CokeNCode> the users know the rules
[07:15] <cryptonic> http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2006/11/08/NVIDIA_brings_Vista-esque_graphics_to_Linux/ , thats a bit strange as i dont think the edgy has beryl built in does it ?
[07:15] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I'm going to attempt to send you the file.
[07:15] <CruCiaL> coz: thats all it says, manufacturer is cable & wireless
[07:15] <coz_> CruCiaL, ok
[07:15] <cryptonic> it doesnt even have it in the repositries from what i know.
[07:15] <coz_> CruCiaL, i will look
[07:15] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: can u send it again, mirc just blocked it
[07:15] <CokeNCode> so ... is there such a command ... that doesn't involve me listing EVERY individual user
[07:15] <CokeNCode> other than root
[07:16] <CruCiaL> coz, thanks
[07:16] <Apollo> i think i can help with that one the root password is the user password. i ran into the same problem, just repeat your password, even when it says your password is wrong
[07:16] <ifireball> CokeNCode: kinda violent... its one of those things where my "there must be a better way" spider-instinct acts up
[07:16] <jtf0518> adam, it sounds like  your video on the laptop is hosed. Especially if you get no video in Windows or Ubuntu.
[07:16] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: ok
[07:16] <unimatrix9> _Genrl_Zo i guess everything went well, and you are running the machine with joy right now...
[07:16] <aeruder> quick question, i've got the edgy eft live cd/install cd in, is there a way at the console to do the installation? (i.e. i've got the live cd booted ,but i want to use the console installer)
[07:16] <jtf0518> adam, what happens if you boot with an XP CD? do you get the text install?
[07:16] <rexy> is there a repository wich has the new mplayer with wmv support and a 32bit version for swiftfox (on edgy)
[07:16] <orville> cryptonic: edgy has aiglx build in, but beryl is available separately
[07:17] <CokeNCode> ifireball, well, I guess that might be true ... *shrug
[07:17] <unimatrix9> _Genrl_Zo good luck , catch you later maybe
[07:17] <unimatrix9> :)
[07:17] <CokeNCode> but, this is how we do it.
[07:17] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: what is this file
[07:17] <Saulren> Good day, everyone.  Anyone have the time and patience to help a newbie?
[07:17] <ifireball> CokeNCode: just use a combination of who,grep,sed,xargs and killall -u ; you can do it in a one liner
[07:17] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: the Network-Manager-Gnome
[07:17] <aeruder> Saulren: don't ask to ask
[07:17] <rexy> dont ask to ask Saulren , just spit it out :)
[07:17] <Saulren> lol
[07:17] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Here, I just uploaded it: http://d.turboupload.com/d/1203026/network-manager-gnome_0.6.3-2ubuntu6_i386.deb.html
[07:18] <jerp> Does anyone know if the AIGLX CD offered by Kororaa at http://linux.softpedia.com is worth the trouble?
=== james is now known as daylighter
[07:18] <MarcN> Stormx2: check out that out.ogg I pointed to you
[07:18] <aeruder> Saulren: just ask your question
[07:18] <coz_> CruCiaL, in the terminal typ lsusb we need more info
[07:18] <daylighter> grrrrrrrrrrrr...
[07:18] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: just checking now
[07:18] <Saulren> Well here's the deal.  I had been working on a language called coldC in a linux knockoff and recently switched to Unbuntu on VMware
[07:18] <jtf0518> well, gotta go. Colts game is coming on.
[07:18] <coz_> CruCiaL, this is when you boot into ubuntu
[07:18] <Saulren> I am trying to get the driver (genesis) that runs the coldC serv to install, but I'm missing most of the headers required to compile
[07:18] <cryptonic> how do i get out of xserver to install the new nvidia driver?
[07:18] <orville> looks like it's time for me to grab nvidia drivers.
[07:18] <Saulren> I'm guessing I need to get some sort of addons to handle the make install
[07:18] <CokeNCode> ifireball, really ? how exactly would i get those to communicate in a wya that doesn't require my intervention in anyway
[07:19] <coz_> CruCiaL, lspci and or lsusb to get more info on the device you have, write down all the numbers and info it puts out
[07:19] <Efdar> FUCKING MONKIES IN A POOPIE WORLD
[07:19] <Efdar> FUCKING MONKIES IN A POOPIE WORLD
[07:19] <Efdar> FUCKING MONKIES IN A POOPIE WORLD
[07:19] <Efdar> FUCKING MONKIES IN A POOPIE WORLD
[07:19] <CokeNCode> remember, i'm trying to write a shell script
[07:19] <Saulren> But I'm completely clueless.
[07:19] <aeruder> Saulren: what header files are missing
[07:19] <Nutubuntu> I forgot to say, this is on Dapper (Synaptic displays error messages during the installation/config of clamav: "configuration error - unknown item 'QUOTAS_ENAB' (notify administrator)" and four more. Is this a problem? I've looked at the clamav website but not found it there.)
[07:19] <coz_> Efdar, guy you sound frustrated however, language .. dude careful on the language
[07:19] <daylighter> I am getting the error " no composite extension" when I enable beryl
[07:19] <Saulren> I currently have Ubuntu-6.06.1 installed and running.
[07:19] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: ok, just open the package when in Ubuntu and allow Ubuntu to install it. You then need to go and do this: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces and comment out with these (#) comment out everything except the "lo" stuff
[07:19] <ompaul> Saulren, try installing build-essential and it may help a lot
[07:20] <Saulren> How would I go about that?
[07:20] <CruCiaL> coz: ill have to reboot and do this, ill be back in bout 5-10 minutes
[07:20] <ifireball> CokeNCode: are you trying to get me to write the script for you?
[07:20] <aeruder> Saulren: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[07:20] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: wait
[07:20] <Megaqwerty> you don't have to comment those out anymore.
[07:20] <ompaul> Saulren, system - administration - synaptic package manager from the menu (lots of ways to do it)
[07:21] <Megaqwerty> forget that, just install the network-manager-gnome. It will appear in your upper right hand corner.
[07:21] <Megaqwerty> just point and click.
[07:21] <Brokenstein> i'm trying to switch to kubuntu, any advice how to really clean out gnome and gnome apps?
[07:22] <unimatrix9> who is using an lenovo new laptop with ubuntu?
[07:22] <ompaul> Brokenstein, you don't need to if you have the room, you could try sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome; sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[07:22] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: ive downloaded this file, where do i put it
[07:22] <Zarephath> Anyone know of a good diary/daily journal software for linux?
[07:23] <mumbles-potpal> are the repository's down ?
[07:23] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: anywhere Ubuntu can read it.
[07:23] <Megaqwerty> (I'm assuming you are in windows right now)
[07:23] <mumbles-potpal> im ggettign could not download all repository indexes.
[07:23] <jerp>  AIGLX on a LIVE CD ........ http://linux.softpedia.com/progDownload/Kororaa-Xgl-Live-CD-Download-10372.html
[07:23] <unimatrix9> zarephath , maybe use tiddlywiki?
[07:23] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: once you reboot into Ubuntu, just double click on the file and install it.
[07:23] <maccam94> kororaaa is so old...
[07:23] <maccam94> and dead
[07:23] <maccam94> i think the new one is sabayon
[07:24] <timhaughton> A piece of software I'm building requires the libssh headers. Does anyone know which package might bring them in?
[07:24] <aeruder> sudo apt-get --purge remove gnome would only remove the metapackage
[07:24] <AsheD> does anybody know why my Ubuntu suddenly restarts X if I hit shift-backspace?
[07:24] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: im in windows now, but i cannot see the drive which ubuntu is installed in 'my computer'
[07:24] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: that doesn't matter. Ubuntu can see your windows partition.
[07:24] <ompaul> AsheD, cos that is how x works you can alter that behaviour if you want (some day you may want it)
[07:24] <Zarephath> unimatrix9, : thanks
[07:24] <aeruder> its normally ctrl-alt
[07:25] <Saulren2> Ack, got disconnected.  Seems my ghost is still here.
[07:25] <wildchild> there was an error initializing the audio i/o layer. You wil not be able to play or record audio. How can I set up layer?
[07:25] <unimatrix9> or http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html
[07:25] <AsheD> ompaul:: where do I modify that? and yeh, it used to work on ctrl-alt-backspace, not shift-backspace
[07:25] <unimatrix9> wich does the same kind of thing
[07:25] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: After installing, simply reboot once more, and it should be in your upper right hand corner. just click on it, and select the network you want to connect to.
[07:25] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: so if i put it into my C:\ in windows, where do i go in ubuntu
[07:25] <ompaul> AsheD, ahh had not read your comment correctly - no idea
[07:25] <aeruder> AsheD: sounds like some funkiness on your keyboard
[07:25] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: probably to media/sda2/windows
[07:26] <aeruder> keyboards are interesting hardware, sometimes certain key combinations just don't work or certain key combinations send the wrong key combinations
[07:26] <unimatrix9> bye bye all
[07:26] <dxdemetriou> Can I enable the roll-up instead of maximize with double click on nautilus?
[07:26] <unimatrix9> :)
[07:26] <coz_> CruCiaL, if you are going to install that you will have top ut it on a flash drive or floppy or cd then move it onto ubuntu and so the dpkg -i thing
[07:26] <AsheD> is there nothing I can do about it then?
[07:26] <coz_> CruCiaL, safest way
[07:27] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I agree, that would be the easiest, assuming that you can do that.
[07:27] <daylighter> "XGL Absent, assuming AIGLX" does this mean I need to install one of the two?
[07:27] <CruCiaL> coz: if i put it on a flash drive, how do i access the flash drive in ubuntu
[07:27] <ifireball> CokeNCode: actualyl, you can probably make it a tad faster by using some black magic parameters to "ps", then "grep", "cut", "xargs" and regural "kill"
[07:27] <ompaul> aeruder, xmodmap, .profile .bashrc can all be influencers and then there is the hardware they are plugged into
[07:27] <noelia_> 
[07:27] <cryptonic> how do i see what version nvidia drivers i have installed atm?
[07:27] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Simply doubleclick on "usbdisk" which will be on your desktop.
[07:27] <coz_> CruCiaL, first boot into ubuntu then plug in the flash drive and it will open up as soon as it is plugged in, then
[07:28] <aeruder> ompaul: of course, but i doubt he has that set up in xmodmap
[07:28] <coz_> CruCiaL, drag the file onto the desktop
[07:28] <aeruder> and well, .profile and .bashrc can only do it with xmodmap (still unlikely)
[07:28] <ompaul> aeruder, point
[07:28] <coz_> CruCiaL, then open a terminal and cd /home/yourusername/Desktop
[07:28] <Saulren2> Apparently, since I have no password set, I cannot access my Administration programs... why is that?
[07:28] <coz_> CruCiaL, then sudo dpkg -i thenameof file
[07:28] <aeruder> but yea, all i'm saying is somehow or another his shift-backspace is getting mapped to ctrl-alt-backspace
[07:28] <Megaqwerty> CruCial: assuming that it is already plugged in, it will be there, and then just double click on the file and run it.
[07:28] <aeruder> Saulren2: its asking for your user password
[07:29] <Megaqwerty> CruciaL: it is as simple as that.
[07:29] <Saulren2> I never set a user password.
[07:29] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: what happens when you do 'sudo ls'  and enter in a blank password?
[07:29] <cryptonic> how do i see what version nvidia drivers i have installed atm?
[07:30] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, there's a short pause, and back to the terminal prompt.
[07:30] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: doesn't bitch and complain or list the dir?
[07:30] <CruCiaL> coz & megaqwerty: thanx for your help...il try this now, and i should be able to connect, if all goes well, ill reply in ubuntu :-)
[07:30] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: just to be sure 'sudo ls /etc'
[07:30] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, nope.  Just pauses and then goes back to the prompt.
[07:30] <Saulren2> ok
[07:30] <aeruder> change your password
[07:30] <aeruder> passwd
[07:30] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: just to be sure something is in the dir
[07:30] <Megaqwerty> you're welcome.
[07:30] <coz_> CruCiaL, well if you don't have a driver you will not connect
[07:31] <mumbles-potpal> how do i test synaptic's connection to the net?
[07:31] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, same thing.
[07:31] <coz_> CruCiaL, but check it out anywaty
[07:31] <coz_> anyway
[07:31] <aeruder> Saulren2: i doubt you'll get much done with a blank password
[07:31] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: yeah sudo wants you to have a password then, so you need to set one  'passwd'\
[07:31] <aeruder> lots of programs won't take it
[07:31] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: err   'passwd'
[07:31] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, thats the syntax?   set one 'pw'  ?
[07:32] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: 'passwd'
[07:32] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: that will prompt you
[07:32] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: that will set the passwd for your user and then for sudo commands or admin commands, it will be the same one
[07:32] <HipotermiA> Hi guys!
[07:33] <nox-Hand> I need help with setting up a wireless card for Ubuntu - on a Dell Inspiron 2200
[07:33] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, Hmm.. I think I'm screwing it up. haha
[07:34] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: you in a terminal window right?  just type 'passwd'  without the 's btw, that just means the command is inside of ' here '
[07:34] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, I did what you said, and then did  sudo ls   and got a prompt for current unix password
[07:34] <nox-Hand> !tell nox-Hand about wireless
[07:34] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: that's normal, now type your password
[07:34] <n1gke> Howdy folks....
[07:34] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: sudo wants to be sure it's you is the idea
[07:34] <gh0st> hello, is there any good mass-renamer for linux?
[07:35] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, aye, but when it prompts me for my Current UNIX password, I dont know what to put.
[07:35] <Keyseir> Vorbote: I just installed Windows XP Pro SP2 on vmware. Installation went peachy. Downloaded .NET 2.0... near the end of the isntallation, vmware player reverts to small mode in the upper left, blue screen white letters, and quickly restarts... reboots, gets to desktop, is slow as crap. This ring any bells?
[07:35] <n1gke> Anyone have a spare Pentium III Copermine available please ??
[07:35] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: when you ran 'passwd' what did you enter?
[07:35] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: don't say it here lol
[07:35] <daylighter> mmmm delicious BSOD
[07:35] <cryptonic> how do i see what version nvidia drivers i have installed atm?
[07:35] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: when you ran 'passwd' you entered something, that is your password

[07:37] <court> anyone good with networking?
[07:38] <pfhomer> I am on a 128 MB machine and want to save ram. how do I disable the disk cache?
[07:38] <cryptonic> how do i leave xserver then?
[07:38] <winterp1> sudo hdparm -W0 /dev/hda
[07:38] <rexy> is there a repository wich has a new mplayer with wmv support and a 32bit version for swiftfox (on edgy)?
[07:38] <winterp1> for  disk cache
[07:38] <court> rexy, automatix
[07:38] <rexy> i used that
[07:38] <court> i dunno then
[07:39] <rexy> installed mplayer and mplayer-plugin
[07:39] <court> works fine for me
[07:39] <leafw> how come in the gnome desktop one cannot set a different wallpaper for each workspace?
[07:39] <court> did you install the codecs?
[07:39] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: if your nick isn't registered, I won't
[07:39] <rexy> w32codecs? dont work 64 bit system
[07:39] <court> leafw, are you good with networking?
[07:39] <court> hmmm
[07:39] <coz_> leafw, i ask the samed question
[07:39] <rexy> i read the new mplayer has native support, but that i'd need a 32bit version of mplayer for the swiftfox package
[07:40] <prim8> Stupid question: I am using static IP, I found how to set my DNS in System > Admin > Networking, but I lose the info when I reboot.  How can I save it so that I don't have to reconfigure on reboot?
[07:40] <Sp4rKy> hi
[07:40] <jrib> leafw, coz_ :  google for 'wallpapoz'
[07:40] <coz_> jrib, sounds good .. will do
[07:40] <Sp4rKy> please, does anyone know how i can set a charset for the subject of an email (from a script using sendmail)?
[07:40] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak I'll just tell you what i said here
[07:40] <Nem|ltop> hey i was wondering if somebody could help me set up dual monitors in ubuntu, i tried to follow a guide but it didn't seem to work
[07:40] <Saulren2> Since I dont use my real pw
[07:40] <john64> does anyone know of a way to have a PDF printer in Ubuntu?
[07:40] <jerp> pfhomer, look in the documentation/Ubuntu Packageing Guide/Installation/Prerequisites
[07:40] <Enselic> If I want to get a primary date for the           Mono 1.2 Ubuntu          package, who should I ask?
[07:41] <leafw> court : ok
[07:41] <Saulren2> First I typed:  set one mypw
[07:41] <jbroome> john64: you can do it with a samba virtual printer
[07:41] <jrib> jerp: yes, install cups-pdf I think
[07:41] <jrib> john64: yes, install cups-pdf I think
[07:41] <Saulren2> then:   set one 'passwd'
[07:41] <Saulren2> then:  set one 'mypw'
[07:41] <john64> jbroome: is there a way to do it locally?
[07:41] <clearzen> I'm trying to change the permissions on a ext3 filesystem. I've tried chown and chmod and niether of them have actually changed the permissions on the disk. What else can I use?
[07:41] <leafw> court : can't believe it's not built-in to gnome
[07:41] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, nothing happened any of those times.
[07:41] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: heh no 'set one'  just   'passwd'
[07:41] <jerp> or use cache in the search
[07:41] <Saulren2> ahhh
[07:41] <Saulren2> lol
[07:41] <jbroome> john64: actually, OOo will save as a PDF also
[07:41] <leafw> coz_ : networking you mean mental contact or waht
[07:41] <court> leafw, what? desktop backgrounds?
[07:41] <leafw> I just stepped in
[07:41] <leafw> court : yes. One for each workspace.
[07:41] <Saulren2> do u put the pw in the ' s
[07:42] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: you really need to have a password, it's such a bad idea not to have one on a system
[07:42] <noxxle> is there an easy way to control my fans?
[07:42] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, aye
[07:42] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: no, when you type   passwd   it will just ask you to enter one
[07:42] <Saulren2> nvm that last question
[07:42] <john64> jbroome: i am looking to be able to create PDF's from any application that has printing support, not reliant on windows, networking or samba
[07:42] <jrib> john64: cups-pdf
[07:42] <Tater> hey all
[07:43] <Saulren2> kingsqueak, it keeps prompting me for my current UNIX password, and no matter what I type it says failed.
[07:43] <john64> jrib: thanks!
[07:43] <Tater> I got a drive I can't mount or see but I can see it being recognized when the bios loads any ideas?
[07:43] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: hmm your current one should be ..nothing
[07:43] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: just hit <enter> when it asks for current
=== james is now known as Daylighter
[07:43] <rexy> tator is it paritioned? is it enabled in the kernel?
[07:43] <Saulren2> kingsqueak, exactly.  I never set it, and I tried that.
[07:43] <jrib> john64: be sure to read /usr/share/doc/cups-pdf/README.Debian  since I couldn't find where my pdf's went at first :)
[07:43] <Daylighter> yay! IT WORKS :-)
[07:44] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: when i run the app from the desktoop it says error: dependency is not satisfiable: libatl1.0-0
[07:44] <john64> jrib: Thanks, also, which driver should i use in the printer setup wizard thing
[07:44] <Tater> rexy yeah its partitioned its a ubuntu installation from my laptop I wanted to redo it but I can't get it to mount

[07:44] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: odd, you have a bit of a problem then as you need to do a password recovery procedure to fix it
[07:44] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, it shouldn't have anything to do with my current windows password
[07:44] <CruCiaL> coz: when i run the app from the desktoop it says error: dependency is not satisfiable: libatl1.0-0
[07:44] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: not at all
[07:44] <dal> hello?
[07:45] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: just so I'm not completely insane here, you are booted into Ubuntu right now right?
[07:45] <smok> any1?
[07:45] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, lol yeah.
[07:45] <dal> i need help !
[07:45] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, It never asked me for a password.
[07:45] <CruCiaL> coz_: r u there?
[07:45] <Saulren2> So it should be blank...
[07:45] <Daylighter> whoaaaaaaaaa
[07:45] <simmerz> what package do i need to install to get apache to do combinedv logging?
[07:45] <Daylighter> this is nice, but I want to get rid of the wobbly menus
[07:45] <cryptonic> how do i leave xserver then?
[07:45] <court_> leafw
[07:45] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: during install it definitely asked you to put in a password
[07:46] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: this is installed and not the live CD right?
[07:46] <strabes> Daylighter: you can change that stuff in the animations plugin of beryl-settings
[07:46] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, I downloaded it from VWmare, and ran it on the VMware player.
[07:46] <smok> hello  I am a new to ubuntu . I have just instaled ubuntu 5.10 and fidout there is 6.10. I have dual boot for XP. How do I upgrade ubuntu 5.10 to 6.10 ??
[07:46] <cryptonic> how do i leave xserver then?
[07:46] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: oh, not sure what that image would be
[07:46] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: it may have a default root password of some kind
[07:46] <Daylighter> the settings in beryl-settings are confusing
[07:47] <CruCiaL> coz_: r u there?
[07:47] <amo> hello
[07:47] <jerp> smok,  go to http://www.ubuntu.com/  and use the links

[07:47] <jerp> the word download will lead you
[07:47] <amo> i'm searching for help on xchat-gnome
[07:48] <CruCiaL> can anyone help me with gnome network manager?
[07:48] <court_> im having probles with my wireless card. Any gurus in here?
[07:48] <cassidy_> amo: what's your problem ?

[07:48] <smok> thanks
[07:48] <smok> !upgrade
[07:48] <jerp> smok, there is an alternate CD install
[07:48] <CruCiaL> i have problems with my usb wireless adapter too
[07:49] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Did it work?
[07:49] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: nope its says:
[07:49] <smok> <jerp>if boot to 5.10 can i instal 6.10 fom there?
[07:49] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, whats a common Root pw?
[07:49] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: when i run the app from the desktoop it says error: dependency is not satisfiable: libatl1.0-0
[07:49] <amo> please, how to add a server in the list in xchat-gnome ?
[07:49] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Just a second, I'll get that for you.
[07:49] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: heh I don't know what it would be set to, were there any README files with that vmplayer image?
[07:49] <jerp> smok, it so old, I get the CD
[07:49] <Yokanzo> What kind of program opens .rpm files
[07:49] <cryptonic> how do i exit xserver?
[07:50] <Yokanzo> archive manager tells me it's not supported
[07:50] <nox-Hand> Is the cabextract package not in apt?
[07:50] <jerp> Yokanzo: a deb packer
[07:50] <cassidy_> amo: edit -> pref -> networks
[07:50] <winterp1> use alien for  .rpm
[07:50] <amo> a .rpm is a compiled programm for debian based OS
[07:50] <nox-Hand> Or is that in the masked packages (( #'s in sources.list)
[07:50] <jbroome> amo: err, no
[07:50] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: try user ubuntu pass ubuntu
[07:50] <amo> oh ? sorry so ...
[07:50] <Yokanzo> I need to install an rpm program
[07:51] <Yokanzo> how can I allow it to be supported
[07:51] <amo> cassidy_: thx
[07:51] <cassidy_> amo: np :)
[07:51] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: meaning, you may be the user 'ubuntu' now, so try password of 'ubuntu'
[07:51] <jbroome> Saulren2: try a blank pw, or root as the PW or check on the VMware site to see if the provider listed one.  if not boot into single user mode and change it
[07:51] <Daylighter> i'm still not figuring out how to change the settings for the menus
[07:51] <jbroome> !rpm > Yokanzo
[07:51] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Are you sure that is the right error message?
[07:52] <winterp1> Yokanzo: sudo apt-get -y install alien
[07:52] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: yup, it started to load, then it displays this in red, with info below, the install button was greyed out so i could not press it
[07:52] <Lam_> !sfv
[07:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sfv - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:52] <Megaqwerty> okay.
[07:52] <jerp> enter rpm in the synaptic search it should return a zip prog of sorts
[07:52] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, thanks!
[07:52] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, that did the trick.
[07:52] <Yokanzo> thanks
[07:52] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: no problem
[07:52] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: now set that sucker to your own password
[07:53] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, now I can finally try to add these packages.

[07:53] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: sorry, I can't find that one, but are you sure it isn't "libatk1.0-0"?
[07:53] <cryptonic> how do i exit xserver?
[07:54] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: yes sorry, i mistyped
[07:54] <Megaqwerty> ok, that one I can get for you.
[07:54] <smok> <jerp> I have 5.10 trying to upgr to 6.10    I am booting from 6.10 cd and It tells me "xx.xxxx Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block x" and this keeps going but X values hanges
[07:54] <Saulren2> KIngsqueak, did you happen to catch my original question about running (Genesis) driver for a program called coldC?
[07:54] <amo> bye
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: no clue there
[07:55] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, genesis requires you to install it using a C compiler, however when I did the make install I was missing several C libraries
[07:55] <smok> how do I upgadee?
[07:55] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, just curious as to whether you know which package might include those.
[07:55] <Daylighter> this water effect is amazing
[07:55] <Nem|ltop> how can i tell if i have the binary graphics drivers installed for my video cards?
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: libs in ubuntu with headers are called   foolib-dev  as opposed to just foolib
[07:55] <smok> <jerp>
[07:55] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I just uploaded it here: http://d.turboupload.com/d/1203094/libatk1.0-0_1.12.3-0ubuntu1_i386.deb.html
[07:55] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: to compile something you'll need the -dev package of the lib you want
[07:56] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: ok thanx, wot was the problem?
[07:56] <mewshi> is it safe to update from dapper to edgy now?
[07:56] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Ubuntu didn't have that specific library installed
[07:56] <Daylighter> I still cant figure out how to shut off the wavy menus
[07:56] <Daylighter> SO many settings
[07:56] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: install that before installing the network-manager-gnome
[07:56] <roryy> mewshi: i've done it; going great so far
[07:56] <qwertybob> i just installed amd64 dapper and want to update it to edgy also
[07:56] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, would that be under the Libraries?
[07:56] <smok> I have 5.10 trying to upgr to 6.10    I am booting from 6.10 cd and It tells me "xx.xxxx Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block x" and this keeps going but X values hanges
[07:56] <Megaqwerty> Hopefully it will work this time! :-)
[07:56] <jerp> Youe suppose to be able to kill an X session by using Ctrl-Alt-Backspace combination.
[07:56] <Kingsqueak> Saulren2: likely, yes
[07:57] <smok> any 1 please
[07:57] <panzer> ubuntu-es
[07:57] <qwertybob> roryy: do i just change repos to edgy where it says dapper?
[07:57] <roryy> qwertybob: i'd read the upgrade notes if i were you
[07:57] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: hopefully, i just want to get on the net, once ive done that, i can start learning unix/linux/ubuntu!

[07:57] <smok> no
[07:57] <xd45> prolly why
[07:57] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, heh I'm actually pretty clueless as to which libraries I need.  Unix is not my thing at all.
[07:57] <smok> how?
[07:57] <qwertybob> roryy: i would install edgy64 but it locks up unless i use noacpi etc
[07:58] <dal> HELLO????
[07:58] <xd45> what method are you using cd?
[07:58] <Saulren2> Kingsqueak, I might have to wait til some of the coldC developers wake up so that I can ask them.
[07:58] <dal> HOW CAN I REGISTER??
[07:58] <qwertybob> trying different route
[07:58] <Megaqwerty> hello dal

[08:01] <dal> it says this nickname is already registered
[08:01] <xd45> u dit 2 x?
[08:01] <Daylighter> haha! fixed
[08:01] <cusco> dudes...

[08:02] <smok> redo download?
[08:02] <winterp1> both
[08:02] <Megaqwerty> dal: I guess you will have to get a new one. or one similar.
[08:02] <xd45> and redo burn preferably
[08:02] <jbroome> Yokanzo: as long as there isn't files with the same name, it'll add

[08:04] <abasinisvacant> so am i registered now? how do i check?
[08:04] <Megaqwerty> !rpm
[08:04] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).

[08:08] <NemesisD> i have 2 DVI LCDs but does that mean I chose DFP?
[08:08] <ryanakca> does you computer blow up? does the pizza guy ring your doorbell? What happens when you boot your CD?
[08:08] <NemesisD> i thought DFP was a certain kind of connector that isn't used anymore
[08:09] <Nutubuntu> Be well all

[08:11] <Spee_Der> That way you can restart X without restatring the computer....
[08:12] <jbroome> ryanakca: the trajectory you keep asking about every 5 minutes
[08:12] <mojojojo_> green_earz, it sometimes cease to load for gnome-terminal. I wouln't suspect this program for large memory or cpu usage.

[08:13] <angelaki> who can help me with gdesklets starterbar??? (pm please)

[08:14] <angelaki> who can help me with gdesklets starterbar??? (pm please)
[08:14] <Kingsqueak> angelaki: what are you stuck on?
[08:14] <mojojojo_> green_earz, an this particular program doesn't consume to much. The problem is somewhere else, but I don't know where to look
[08:14] <NemesisD> ok so now my other monitor is displaying but i have a problem
[08:14] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Whoa Boy, there are a lot of possibilities.

[08:18] <Zuzu> Hello, my Xserver is not working, and I'm trying to upgrade my xorg packages, but apt-get says that it has been kept back. Is there a way to get them to install?
[08:19] <moonwatcher> Spee_Der: i understand the OS drivers and therfor AIGLX is not quite there yet, but that the fglrx drivers are not the latest...
[08:19] <xjeethux> Daylighter: Care to help me with Xgl ? :p
[08:19] <moonwatcher> can i just upgrade the fglrx drivers to the latest and have compiz and video with them?
[08:19] <Pelo> good afternoon folks
[08:20] <Pelo> anyone here using dapper ?  I need to get the name of something I can'T seem to find in edgy
[08:20] <Spee_Der> Ok, don't know that card, sorry.....
[08:20] <Spee_Der> Pelo: What you looking for ?
[08:20] <NemesisD> Spee_Der, mine or moon's?
[08:20] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I'm still working, don't worry
[08:20] <Spee_Der> Your's Nem
[08:20] <moonwatcher> Spee_Der: are you familiar with matrox on linux, do you know what works on a Parhelia PCIe 128?
[08:21] <NemesisD> Spee_Der, is there somewhere I should look? this seems like it should be an easy fix
[08:21] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  there was a prog in system > admin  that gave a list and a display of drives  with info on  size , free space, format etc
[08:21] <freeze> whats the website where you can download different login screens with ubuntu
[08:21] <Pelo> NemesisD,   have you tried searching in the forum for your card model yet ?
[08:21] <bruenig> freeze, art.gnome.org gnome-look.org
[08:22] <NemesisD> i'll try that
[08:22] <Spee_Der> Pelo: Are you thinking of Qparted perhaps ?
[08:22] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: ok thanx again :-)
[08:22] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  it came with the default install of dapper, but I will have a look
[08:22] <Ciaus> I am trying to install crossover office professional on dapper, there are several types of packages which can be choosen, should I pick the Debain version, or the Loki installer?
[08:22] <Spee_Der> Pelo: Ok.
[08:22] <qubix__> anyone know how to setup the bitchx irc client, and make it use the CORRECT TRUE ansi font??
[08:22] <moonwatcher> Spee_Der: what about mine? will upgradin to the latest fglrx driver and then installing the compiz reps get me there?
[08:23] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  nope
[08:23] <Spee_Der> moonwatcher: Not sure really as I have only in the last week or so started to finger this all out.... My 2nd monitor is still not active.....
[08:23] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: do you have the vga fonts it likes installed?
[08:23] <Spee_Der> Pelo: Ok, let me look as I am using Dapper v6.06 LTS.
[08:24] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, could i possibly pm you?
[08:24] <moonwatcher> Spee_Der: oh i dont mind if the video out will come abit later, i still  have XP dual booted on the machine so i can boot there to watch video in the mean while
[08:24] <Spee_Der> Pelo: In System, Admin, DISKS, is that what you need ?
[08:24] <Kingsqueak> I'd prefer not, these fonts work with BitchX nicely  http://www.kingsqueak.org/stuff/vgafonts.tar.gz
[08:24] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  yep
[08:24] <Kingsqueak> it's an old tarball I keep kicking around, not sure if ubuntu has a package for them or not
[08:25] <xjeethux> Can someone help me with this xgl problem ?
[08:25] <qubix__> Kingsqueak,  heres my dir command in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
[08:25] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  can you check the about screen and see if you can find the package name for me
[08:25] <qubix__> default8x16.pcf.gz  vga11x19.pcf
[08:25] <moonwatcher> btw, anyon knows what is working on the new MacBook pro?
[08:25] <qubix__> but
[08:25] <qubix__> i cant use it!
[08:25] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: when you put them in, did you run 'mkfontdir' in that dir?
[08:25] <qubix__> no i didnt
[08:25] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: and after that, either restart X or do  'xset fp rehash'
[08:25] <bruenig> qubix__, you should use ls, not dir
[08:25] <Zuzu> anyone? :(
[08:26] <Spee_Der> Pelo: I'm working on that.....
[08:26] <Arokh> is postfix only for sending mail (smtp), or can you use it to receive mail as well (pop)?
[08:26] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: you need to run that command as root so in the misc/ dir do  'sudo mkfontdir'
[08:26] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I'm taking a while because I'm trying to account for every possible dependency you may have a problem with
[08:26] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, should i mkfont dir in the directory vga11x19 is in?
[08:26] <moonwatcher> i keep typing ls in dos :)
[08:26] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: yes
[08:26] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, ok then what
[08:26] <Ciaus> can anyone answer this question?
[08:26] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: then as your user running X, do 'xset fp rehash'
[08:26] <Ciaus> I am trying to install crossover office professional on dapper, there are several types of packages which can be choosen, should I pick the Debain version, or the Loki installer?
[08:26] <bruenig> or at least alias dir so that it is ls
[08:26] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: I'm about 3/5 done
[08:26] <green_earz> Arokh: send and receive mail with the postfix server
[08:27] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: thankyou for the time
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: then 'xterm -fn vga11x19 -fg white -bg black'
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: that should then work better with BitchX
[08:27] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, should i mkfontdir as root?
[08:27] <winterp1> Zuzu  ati  or nvidia?
[08:27] <Spee_Der> Pelo: It won't give me the ABOUT for that file/program..... It comes up with error message, even though I am using sudo disks
[08:27] <Zuzu> winterp1: Intel.
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: 'sudo mkfontdir' in that directory
=== AsheK is now known as AsheD
[08:27] <qubix__> ok
[08:27] <qubix__> then xset fp rehash as user?
[08:27] <winterp1> Zuzu: u got the right  driver ?
[08:27] <Kingsqueak> yes
[08:27] <nox-Hand> essid is the network name, isn't it?
[08:27] <qubix__> ok
[08:27] <qubix__> i did those 2
[08:27] <qubix__> letm e try
[08:27] <celia_> hello
[08:27] <Arokh> ok, I tried getting postfix to send emails from a php script to my comcast email addres but comcast blocks it. Instead, I want to have it send to "itself" and then I can retrieve them with Thunderbird
[08:28] <celia_>  I'm new
[08:28] <Spee_Der> Pelo: From the console, sudo disks-admin
[08:28] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, im getting this _ xterm:  unable to open font "vga11x19", trying "fixed"....
[08:28] <celia_> I speak spanish
[08:28] <Texas915> what is the repo mozilla mplayer plugin
[08:28] <bruenig> !es | celia_
[08:28] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: hmm should have worked
[08:28] <ubotu> celia_: Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[08:28] <Pelo> Spee_Der,  thanks
[08:28] <qubix__> am i doing this in the right directory?
[08:28] <qubix__> qubix@qubix-sys:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc$
[08:29] <winterp1> Zuzu: u got the intel driver for linux ?
[08:29] <celia_> thank you
[08:29] <Texas915> what is the repo mozilla mplayer plugin
[08:29] <bruenig> Texas915, multiverse

[08:29] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: is that fond path in xorg.conf?
[08:29] <Stormx2> How can I get specs on my graphics card / CPU?
[08:29] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, i havent checked, what should i look for
[08:29] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: look for /path/to/fonts/misc wherever it is that you put that font in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:30] <Spee_Der> Stormx2: hwinfo ?
[08:30] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: if it isn't there, either put the font in wherever xorg.conf has misc shown and do mkfontdir and rehash again or add the path and restart X
[08:30] <qubix__> Kingsqueak,  i see "# path to defoma fonts"
[08:30] <Spee_Der> Stormx2: That works for me.
[08:30] <green_earz> Stormx2: lspci -v    or install hdinfo   for more info about the hard ware
[08:30] <Spee_Der> !moo
[08:30] <xjeethux> Somebody, please help me :(
[08:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about moo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:30] <Spee_Der> !ask
[08:30] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:31] <Arokh> if I use something like notepad++ from my windows machine to edit a file on the linux server, would it be fine or would it corrupt the config files
[08:31] <Pelo> xjeethux,  what do you need help with ?
[08:31] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: do this  'grep misc /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[08:31] <nox-Hand> essid is the network name, is it not?
[08:31] <green_earz> Stormx2: for the cpu look at cat /proc/cpuinfo
[08:31] <CruCiaL> !library
[08:31] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, 	FontPath     "/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc"
[08:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about library - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:31] <qubix__> that is what is in my xorg.conf
[08:31] <bruenig> Arokh, it would be fine, as long as you don't save it as a different file format
[08:31] <Spee_Der> xjeethux: Just ask your question.
[08:31] <xjeethux> Pelo: I installed nvidia-glx
[08:31] <qubix__> but, that isnt the directory vga11x19 is in
[08:31] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: o.k. is that the dir you put the font?
[08:31] <blackmamba> Hey, I'm having some trouble. I want to change my screen resolution to 1152x864, but I can't seem to get it above 1024x768. Help? :P
[08:31] <CruCiaL> !lib
[08:31] <qubix__> no
[08:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lib - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:32] <Pelo> xjeethux,  I can't help you with that
[08:32] <qubix__> should i just add a new fontpath?
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: move the font to that dir, then run mkfontdir in that dir again
[08:32] <Pelo> !nvidia | xjeethux
[08:32] <Zuzu> Zuzu: Yes. I am trying to update them, but it says they have been held back.
[08:32] <ubotu> xjeethux: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: or add a new fontpath, but you have to restart X to do that
[08:32] <qubix__> Kingsqueak,  thats the thing. /usr/share/X11/fonts doesnt even exist!

[08:32] <bruenig> Texas915, if you want to enable the extra repos and install mozilla mplayer plugin just copy and paste the following command, the entire thing including the &&'s,    sudo sed 's/# deb/deb/g' -i.old /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: o.k. 'sudo mkdir /usr/share/X11/fonts'
[08:32] <Keyseir> ff 2.0, edgy eft
[08:32] <qubix__> ahhh!
[08:32] <qubix__> ok
[08:32] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: then 'sudo mkdir /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc'
[08:32] <winterp1> Zuzu: ill try to find out why,  just a  sec...

[08:33] <qubix__> then move vga11x19 into that directory?
[08:33] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: yes
[08:33] <qubix__> k 1 sec
[08:33] <mumbles-potpal> how do i backup a windows install using dd?
[08:33] <mumbles-potpal> or rysic ?
[08:33] <Spee_Der> rogue780: You may have to CHMOD 777 that directory and all the files first.....
[08:34] <xjeethux> with some googling, I found someone has had exactly the same problem, but without a fix mentioned. (http://www.techiegroups.com/t120091-ubuntu-failed-to-start-the-x-server.html)

[08:35] <bruenig> !msg the bot
[08:35] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Okay, it looks like I might be at this all day, so I'm going to make it easier for myself: Here is the link for all the files I have downloaded so far: http://d.turboupload.com/d/1203186/Files_for_CruCiaL.zip.html
[08:35] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[08:35] <Megaqwerty> And here is the page which lists a link to every package that you might need for network-manager-gnome: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/network-manager-gnome.
[08:35] <Megaqwerty> Now, here is what you need to do: If what I have given you doesn't have what you need, go to that page, (http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/network-manager-gnome) and click on the package you need. click on any server you want to download from, and then scroll to the bottom and click on "i386" This will download the file for you.

[08:37] <rogue780> and can someone recommend a good way to start with php?
[08:37] <Pelo> blackmamba,  you'll have to edit  the xorg.conf  file and add that resolution along with the proper refresh rate , which is 64 I think
[08:37] <GeForce> hey guys, I have a small question. I have 2 sound cards in my computer (well, a sound card and an usb headset). The volume control in the tray is fine, but if I use the volume control on my keyboard, it seems to not affect what I want. Anyone knows how to change that?

[08:40] <qubix__> it just says "0"
[08:40] <DanglyBits> have installed openssh-server and started it but admin>>services  says its not running
[08:40] <bruenig> Texas915, do you really want an answer or are you some sort of bot?
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: yeah it should
[08:40] <GeForce> rpedro: I'm changing the default sound card, when I close it, it comes back to what it was....
[08:40] <GeForce> Been doing that since dapper
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: doublecheck the dir you are in and that the font is there
[08:40] <qubix__> all it says is 0
[08:40] <qubix__> wait
[08:40] <qubix__> i did xset fp rehash as root
[08:40] <qubix__> dont i need to do it as user?
[08:40] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: basically you should see vga11x19.pcf vga11x19
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: well fonts.dir should still show it
[08:41] <qubix__> Kingsqueak,  should i add it?
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: not manually
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: 'mkfontdir' does it
[08:41] <winterp1> Zuzu: Didi u  try to uninstall the 'kept back' packages and install newer versions ?
[08:41] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: do i run all of the files in that zip?
[08:41] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: cd /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc, then ls  do you see the font?
[08:41] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: no, they are just there in case you don't have that specific file
[08:42] <winterp1> sry typo
[08:42] <qubix__> qubix@qubix-sys:/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc$ ls
[08:42] <qubix__> fonts.dir  vga11x19.pcf
[08:42] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: So you don't have to reboot (hopefully)
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: now in that dir run 'sudo mkfontdir'
[08:42] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: ok, ill try it now...c u soon maybe?!
[08:42] <qubix__> Kingsqueak, k did it
[08:42] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: Possibly, I have to be somewhere, but I may be on later today
[08:42] <Kingsqueak> is it in the fonts.dir file now?
[08:42] <qubix__> nope
[08:43] <qubix__> just a "0"
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> maybe it doesn't like pcf fonts
[08:43] <qubix__> argh
[08:43] <qubix__> lol
[08:43] <CruCiaL> megaqwerty: ok thanks again for the help
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> you have a bdf of it?
[08:43] <qubix__> cd /nope
[08:43] <Megaqwerty> CruCiaL: anytime!
[08:43] <Kingsqueak> qubix__: not sure what is missing but I think you're missing a package for it to work

[08:50] <DanglyBits> anyone know how to get openssh-server to show up in System>>Admin>>Services ??
[08:50] <Arokh> oh sorry Arcad3 i wouldn't know, i do it all by hand (text files)
[08:50] <Nem|ltop> i was typing in commands at the login prompt
[08:51] <Arcad3> is hard ..
[08:51] <whadar> how do I extract RPMs?
[08:51] <Arcad3> by had the design is bad
[08:51] <Arokh> yeah it's harder, but I'd rather know exactly what my pages are doing
[08:51] <whadar> !RPM
[08:51] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[08:51] <Spee_Der> Nem|ltop: Ok....  So check the /etc/X11 for xorg.conf file.....
[08:51] <Blissex> whadar: 'man rpm2cpio'
[08:51] <swaby1> is there anything like limewire for ubuntu
[08:51] <Blissex> whadar: but don't.
[08:52] <Nem|ltop> holy crap i hate VI
[08:52] <Nem|ltop> is there a more simple command line editor
[08:52] <Spee_Der> swaby1: Yes, there is something similiar..... I have to look it up.....

[08:52] <Nem|ltop> how the F do i exit vi
[08:53] <jatt> haha
[08:53] <Blissex> whadar: then use 'alien' to convert to a 'tar.gz'.
[08:53] <Spee_Der> Nem|ltop: Try Q
[08:53] <Nem|ltop> not working
[08:53] <Spee_Der> I think that's it.
[08:53] <ifireball> Nem|ltop: type :q!
[08:53] <jatt> Nem|ltop: :q!
[08:53] <Blissex> whadar: but if you have to ask, don't do it.
[08:53] <Saulren2> Question: When I compile a driver, it asks me for nbdm, lint, and other headers, can anyone tell me what library that is from?
[08:53] <whadar> Blissex: i don't want to install RPM, i just want to see its files
[08:53] <Wodger> with vi useful to have the man page open in another window i find....
[08:54] <Nem|ltop> thanks
[08:54] <swaby1> are you talking to me?
[08:54] <Blissex> whadar: you really need 'rpm2cpio' or 'alien' (but perhaps 'alien' uses 'rpm2cpio' to convert, so there).
[08:54] <Spee_Der> swaby1: Yes.....
[08:54] <Wodger> mind you i rarely use vim
[08:54] <unreal-dude> is there no search for the FAQ?
[08:54] <swaby1> okay what was it again
[08:54] <Spee_Der> swaby1: I tried to install something like that for my son, but we had no success......
[08:54] <Blissex> whadar: it is part of the 'rpm' package BTW.
[08:55] <Spee_Der> swaby1: I will have to look into it again and finger it out.....
[08:55] <Blissex> whadar: at least in Debian...
[08:55] <whadar> Blissex: thanks
[08:55] <swaby1> anyone else know if there is something like limewire for ubuntu

[08:59] <Paddy_EIRE> is there a "remove" or "reinstall" command that can be issued with "apt-get"

[09:04] <jikbag> what is the best way to make timeoutd start on boot?
[09:04] <bradley> is there a program for altering my hd partition? i want to separate my home folder so reinstalls are easier.
[09:04] <swaby1> okay I downloaded limewire for linux to the desktop but when I click on it it says archive type not supported

[09:05] <gr3g_> it is a rpm type file <--- use alien to install a rpm file :)

[09:06] <Twister829> Hey guys... I just installed JRE 1.5 and JDK 1.5 but I can't get anything to print when I type "echo $JAVA_HOME"?  Any ideas on what could be the problem?
[09:06] <gr3g_> just run sudo apt-get install alien
[09:06] <knix> I can't play large videos with Xv because of a BadAlloc error, but I'm giving my card the same amount of memory I did in dapper (now edgy) and it worked before. I've even increased it by over 20mb
[09:06] <bradley> swaby1, alien is troublesome, it doesn't always get stuff right. make sure you read about it before using it.
[09:07] <mike1o> anybody watch dvb?
[09:07] <gr3g_> yeap bradley
[09:07] <bradley> swaby1, why not try azureus from the repositories?
[09:07] <Terminus> Twister829: that env var is not set by default.

[09:17] <sizzam> Terminus: I'm looking for the actual icon to use for my launcher

[09:21] <Chimera_> AWOS, sorry i wasn't any clearer. After i click on the Install icon in the desktop.
[09:21] <Twister829> nofxx: maybe you should try adding it to shared folders again
[09:21] <compengi> gnomefreak, do you have it too?
[09:21] <nofxx> Twister829, doing it..xD

[09:24] <AWOSLappy> Wow cool thanks Terminus!
[09:24] <gnomefreak> compengi: you dont thats why i asked. ubuntu showing more than 1 floppy is a known bug
[09:24] <Chimera_> AWOS, lol, sorry again. It takes 4 hours to bring the install box.
[09:24] <gnomefreak> compengi: your master would be floppy drive most likely
[09:25] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_, you're fine no need to be sorry :)   Now, what is the processor speed and amount of RAM on this computer?
[09:25] <Chimera_> I haven't actually left it there for 4 hours but i know that if in 20 mins nothing happends, somethnig is wrong since 2.4ghz, 256mbs ram runs fine on older versions, not including 6.06.
[09:25] <compengi> gnomefreak, in device menager under hdd drive i see like volum then my four partitions including swap, i think that volume is the floppy 1 =/

[09:32] <Yokanzo> How do I upgrade my ubuntu again?
[09:32] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ do you already have a version installed?
[09:32] <apokryphos> Yokanzo: check the FAQ
[09:32] <apokryphos> Yokanzo: which is in the channel topic

[09:33] <Crankymonky> apokryphos, See?
[09:33] <AWOSLappy> Um, I got a bunch of versions.  Is the the flood I heard about?
[09:33] <Crankymonky> Bully la
[09:34] <apokryphos> AWOSLappy: yes, currently suffering from bot attacks.
[09:34] <Chimera_> AWOS, no, i don't have anything installed.
[09:34] <Olathe> How do I reinstall all installed packages from the command line ?
[09:34] <compengi> gnomefreak, can i unmount it?
[09:35] <lupine_85> Olathe: with clever use of cut, I'd imagine
[09:35] <gnomefreak> compengi: i dont see why not man umount
[09:35] <Enselic> What is the command to localize large folders again? Is it      du | sort -n    ?
[09:35] <Enselic> seems wrong
[09:35] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_, can you install anything?  does Breezy install?
[09:36] <Chimera_> I don't want to install that version :)
[09:36] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with libbonobo2-Common files for gnome network?

[09:36] <kestaz> ok
[09:36] <gnomefreak> !pastebin > kestaz
[09:36] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with libbonobo2-Common files for gnome network?
[09:36] <Chimera_> AWOS, the point is that niether 6.06 or 6.10 ever installed properly on my laptop. It always had that problem of locking up when double clicking
[09:37] <higin> hello
[09:37] <CruCiaL-X> hi
[09:37] <voraistos> kestaz: your battery might be dead. i know mine is and it does the same thing
[09:37] <higin> does anyone know a tool to change .avi files to .mpg?
[09:37] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ ahh this is a laptop.  you seemed to have not said that before.
[09:37] <eck> Olathe: this might help get you started: aptitude search ".*" | grep ^i
[09:37] <kestaz> no batter is not dead
[09:37] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ this changed everything.  have you tried an external mouse (vs the touchpad)?
[09:37] <kestaz> ubuntu detecting battery
[09:38] <kestaz> but not updating status
[09:38] <kestaz> it's bug
[09:38] <neildarlow> higin: i think the mjpegtools do that
[09:38] <kestaz> and i don't know what to do
[09:38] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with libbonobo2-Common files for gnome network?
[09:38] <higin> ok thanks
[09:38] <zukalk> does anyone know where i could find some kind of tool that would check my hardware and tell me if any part of it may be having failures or if it could possibly slow down the system?
[09:38] <Chimera_> lol, AWOS, what does install dialog locking up the computer have to do with the mouse?
[09:39] <jbroome> CruCiaL-X: i think the magic number is 5 times a minute asking the same question
[09:39] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ I have no clue.  but you said it happens when you double-click.
[09:39] <Clin1> OK, this is my last wuestion on here:  Can any one help me setup my pc to share an internet connection?
[09:39] <voraistos> kestaz: i know there is some kind of chip in the battery.If this gets broken, then your bettery works but does not give any information about remaining power and so.
[09:39] <AWOSLappy> jbroome, don't tempt him!
[09:39] <higin> neildarlow: ive just installed it, but dont know how to run it
[09:39] <Chimera_> AWOS, when i doulble click or launch the install app in any way.
[09:39] <AWOSLappy> Clin1, Ethernet?
[09:39] <Clin1> Yes ethernet
[09:39] <neildarlow> higin: one moment
[09:39] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ ahh.  but everything else on the LiveCD works?
[09:40] <AWOSLappy> Clin1, what subnet?  192.168.x.x?  10.x.x.x?  and fill in the x's.
[09:40] <CruCiaL-X> jbroome: im flapping, i cannot use ubuntu untill i sort this prob, i need help pls
[09:40] <graulich> how do I set an owner for a volume in fstab?
[09:40] <Chimera_> AWOS, yes pretty much. Though it takes time, but not as much as Install. And they run properly.
[09:40] <graulich> *partition
[09:40] <Clin1> Subnet, i think its 255.255.255.0
[09:40] <Chimera_> AWOS, now you know the problem?
[09:40] <Clin1> but we are using 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2
[09:40] <__mikem> Clin1 thats your mask
[09:41] <voraistos> Clin1: this is no subnet, this is network mask
[09:41] <Clin1> Oh, i get them mixed up
[09:41] <Clin1> :p
[09:41] <Froydi> !locale
[09:41] <ubotu> To set up and configure your locales, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf
[09:41] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with libbonobo2-Common files for gnome network?
[09:41] <AWOSLappy> Chimera_ okay.
[09:41] <voraistos> Clin1: yep 192.168.0.0 is your network ID
[09:41] <AWOSLappy> Clin1, 192.168.0.X, okay I got it.  hold on a second.
[09:41] <Clin1> But one Pc is Windows the other is Ubuntu
[09:41] <youser> alright im back
[09:41] <youser> running on live cd
[09:41] <Enselic> Is there a way of getting a list of the size of folders in a dir?
[09:42] <AWOSLappy> right, Clin1 that doesn't make a difference.  is the Windows PC DHCP or manual?
[09:42] <Enselic> I.e. a command or something which recursively calculates that
[09:42] <youser> my install step 5  has been hanging for hours
[09:42] <Enselic> I think I should use du
[09:42] <Enselic> and then | sort -n
[09:42] <AWOSLappy> Enselic, du
[09:42] <youser> this morning my desktop couldnt find any files or apps
[09:42] <Clin1> Im not sure, i usualy do Microsoft Windows network config
[09:42] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with libbonobo2-Common files for gnome network?
[09:42] <Clin1> it sets it up auto
[09:42] <AWOSLappy> Enselic, du -h even.
[09:42] <youser> i restarted and got "operating system not found"
[09:42] <lwizardl> hi
[09:42] <neildarlow> higin: https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=3456&group_id=5776
[09:42] <AWOSLappy> Clin1, ah okay, I can't help you then because I never could get DHCP working on Ubuntu.
[09:43] <voraistos> Clin1 what is your actual problem ?
[09:43] <AWOSLappy> Clin1 sorry :-(
[09:43] <Chimera_> Does anyone know why does the live cd install program lock up or take a very long long long time to load up? 2.4ghz, 256mb ram, 40gbhdd, 6.10 Ubuntu?
[09:43] <Yokanzo> how do I know if I have breezy or not?
[09:43] <youser> i tried running gparted on the live cd and it says no devices detected
[09:43] <lwizardl> where is the known_hosts file
[09:43] <neildarlow> higin: i use those tools as part of kino/dvdstyler so i don't use their many options
[09:43] <higin> neildarlow:  thanks!
[09:43] <Clin1> Dont worry, Voraistoe| Trying to share internet
[09:43] <jrib> my fans seem to turn on and stay on when my display goes blank.  When I start using the computer they usually turn off (and they turn on when they are needed).  Are there any settings for this?  Any ideas where I could look?

[09:44] <neildarlow> higin: section 7.2 looks like what you want :)
[09:44] <green_earz> lwizardl: sorry it should look in the .ssh  dir
[09:44] <voraistos> Clin1 i never did that ;), but i can try. i suppose you want to make your computer a gateway, router or something ? you have 2 ethernet cards ?

[09:45] <voraistos> Clin1: thats waht i call a challenge
[09:45] <AWOSLappy> Undersnore, we will need to know which daemon it is failing on.
[09:45] <CruCiaL-X> nathan1993: a cable and wireless 802.11g wireless usb adapter
[09:45] <Clin1> ETH1 and PPP0
[09:46] <neildarlow> voraistos: that's what i call expensive :)
[09:46] <CruCiaL-X> nathan1993: i was told that i need to instal gnome network manager
[09:46] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: run "apt-get install gnome-network-manager"
=== babwe2 is now known as babwe
[09:46] <CruCiaL-X> nathan1993: but im having trouble installing certain librarys
[09:46] <voraistos> Clin1 is your gateway machine ip adress 192.168.0.1 ?

[09:46] <atarinox> anybody know why firefox is crashing on me everytime i try and load a webpage? after updating to edgy
[09:46] <Clin1> Omg, i cant type

[09:47] <MarcN> CruCiaL-X: the apt-get will get all the needed libraries.
[09:47] <AWOSLappy> atarinox, what version -- 1.5 or 2.0?
[09:47] <neildarlow> atarinox: you might try moving your .mozilla directory out of the way
[09:47] <CruCiaL-X> nathan1993: it says dependency is not satisfiable: libbonobo2-Common
[09:47] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: then apt-get that
[09:47] <atarinox> AWOSLappy: version 2.9
[09:47] <atarinox> 2.0*
[09:48] <jrib> my fans seem to turn on and stay on when my display goes blank.  When I start using the computer they usually turn off (and they turn on when they are needed).  Are there any settings for this?  Any ideas where I could look?
[09:48] <Clin1> Ive tryed the one where it says to insall TinyProxie but i dont know how to configure the other PV
[09:48] <Clin1> Pc*
[09:48] <CruCiaL-X> nathan1993: i dont have an internet connection though, im only have a connection in windows, im using a dual boot, but if i get my adapter to work i might remove windows
[09:48] <neildarlow> Clin1: you should only need to enable forwarding
[09:48] <Clin1> Tell me how Please
[09:49] <atarinox> neildarlow: where should i move the .mozilla directory?
[09:49] <voraistos> Clin1 the other PCs ? You just have to tell them the gateway is 192.168.0.1. and their ip adress has to be 192.168.0.2 , etc ...
[09:49] <Madeye> any idea how to get gaim spell check in Brits not American ?
[09:49] <Froydi> i need som help with the locales

[09:49] <Froydi> : locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
[09:49] <neildarlow> try mv .mozilla .mozilla.save or delete it if you want
[09:49] <Olathe> eck : Thanks :)
[09:49] <zukalk> am i the only one who feels that upgrading to edgy has slowed down my computer A LOT ?
[09:49] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: Go to packages.ubuntu.org and search for it. Download the .deb file. Reboot to Ubuntu. In ubuntu, cd to your windows desktop. run "dpkg -i <.debfile>" where <.debfile> is the .deb file of the needed library
[09:49] <voraistos> Clin1 i havent done any networking on linux for ages. let me check some doc and i tell u
[09:50] <Clin1> K 8-)
[09:50] <neildarlow> zukalk: i don't get that impression.
[09:50] <MarcN> CruCiaL-X: have you done an apt-get update after editing your /etc/apt/sources.list?
[09:50] <Froydi> can anyone help me wit this: locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
[09:50] <atarinox> neildarlow: still crashing
[09:50] <neildarlow> zukalk: unless the upgrade reverted you to a vanilla 386 kernel?
[09:50] <CruCiaL-X> marcn: to be totally honest, i havnt a clue, becuase i am a total newbie
[09:51] <youser> anyone? "operating system not found"
[09:51] <atarinox> how do i install opera if i can't open my browser...it's not in the repositories...
[09:51] <AWOSLappy> Clin1 I can give you the commands to make it a sharing PC
[09:51] <neildarlow> youser: no boot record in the mbr
[09:51] <MarcN> CruCiaL-X: it is very rare that you ever have to download a .deb and use dpkg to install it.  apt-get/aptitude/synaptic/etc all will find all dependancies and download them for you.
[09:51] <Clin1> That should work
[09:51] <youser> thats my problem?
[09:51] <compengi> atarinox, why can't you open firefox?
[09:51] <youser> i just woke up this morning and it was scewed
[09:51] <darksageaura> I get an error every once in a while stating that amarok needs to install mp3 support how do I fix that
[09:51] <Clin1> my root is loged in and ready to go
[09:51] <atarinox> compengi: crashes on me every time i try to load a page
[09:52] <youser> im running the live cd right now
[09:52] <MarcN> CruCiaL-X: did you just upgrade to edgy?  this is a good idea:    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:52] <youser> idunno what to do
[09:52] <Yokanzo> how do I have wmv and mpeg support?
[09:52] <youser> ive been on step 5 of installation for like 2 hours
[09:52] <Undersnore> okay deamon says unable to adress the memory  ... plus it says its already detected a panel running, then kicks me off
[09:52] <Yokanzo> i can't view any images or anything
[09:52] <voraistos> Clin1 can u move to #voraistos please?
[09:52] <CruCiaL-X> MarcN: but dont i need and internet connection to upgrade
[09:52] <neildarlow> Yokanzo: look at the FAQ linked in the channel header
[09:53] <Clin1> K one sec
[09:53] <Yokanzo> sorry, i wasnt thinking
[09:53] <Saulren2> Kingsqueaker, are you busy?
[09:53] <shwag> serpentine loads, but it doesnt burn anything
[09:53] <Chadza> Is there a way to completely reset gnome?  To remove all settings and configurations I've made so far?
[09:53] <youser> arghhh
[09:54] <CruCiaL-X> MarcN: but dont i need and internet connection to upgrade?
[09:54] <java1> youser
[09:54] <youser> yes
[09:54] <MarcN> CruCiaL-X: yup.
[09:54] <ttoine> hey men
[09:54] <java1> you using live cd?
[09:54] <youser> yeah
[09:54] <nalioth> Chadza: in your home directory are .files.  find the one marked .gnome or .gnome2 and rename them
[09:54] <youser> right now
[09:54] <Clin1> Where did he go
[09:54] <java1> I just posted that question on forum
[09:54] <Clin1> i forgot the room
[09:54] <Chadza> nalioth: .gnome_backup or something like that?
[09:54] <nalioth> Chadza: whatever you want to rename them
[09:55] <java1> i was told to get alt install
[09:55] <youser> im in deep problems man
[09:55] <nalioth> Chadza: hopefully something you'll remember  :)
[09:55] <AWOSLappy> Clin1, #voraistos
[09:55] <Chadza> nalioth: And I can restore them by naming them back right?
[09:55] <Clin1> Thanks
[09:55] <voraistos> Clin1 #voraistos
[09:55] <youser> java u talking to me?
[09:55] <youser> i cant find anything useful on ubuntuforums.org
[09:55] <java1> I just downloaded alt install and burning iso now
[09:55] <neildarlow> youser: did you install lilo or grub as your boot manager?
[09:55] <youser> grub
[09:56] <youser> i was running dapper with grub
[09:56] <youser> updated kernel 27
[09:56] <nalioth> Chadza: in my opinion, if your problem is fixed by renaming, i'd move one file at a time from the renamed folders to the newly named folders (you do it one at a time so you know what file broke your gnome)
[09:56] <Saulren2> How do I copy files from my windows partion to my linux one using Ubuntu?
[09:56] <neildarlow> youser: then i'd suggest it needs renistalling
[09:56] <Saulren2> I can't access any of my windows files.
[09:56] <youser> i cant
[09:56] <youser> its hanging on step 5
[09:56] <nalioth> !tell Saulren2 about mountwindows
[09:56] <youser> where it talks about partitioning
[09:57] <youser> im wonderig if someone hacked my computer and messed up hy hd
[09:57] <neildarlow> youser: you should be able to boot the cd in rescue mode an fix it from there
[09:57] <thompa> !nvidia

[09:58] <shwag> anyone used Serpentine, the gnome CD burner ?

[09:58] <neildarlow> shwag: i've used GnomeBaker, the GNOME CD burner
[09:58] <cursedmind> any ideas :/
[09:58] <Chadza> nalioth: Well, I hadn't done anything really.  An icon theme killed gnome, but I had already switched to fluxbox for my desktop.  I just want to be able to put a theme back on the gnome based apps I do use.
[09:59] <AlexExtreme> Hey, is it possible to stop the initrd from loading the aic9xxx module? my motherboard has a broken aic7xxx controller that hangs when the kernel tries to load the driver.
[09:59] <compotatoj> My gnome-panel keeps crashing and whenever I close the bug report it crashes again. How do I delete my gnome-panel prefrences?
[09:59] <shwag> neildarlow: yah...i was trying to get the one working that is included with gnome. Im just trying to burn an audio cd.
[09:59] <shwag> neildarlow: it loads and appears to work, but when I click Burn To Cd,..nothing happens.
[09:59] <neildarlow> shwag: maybe cdrecord isn't detecting your burner?
[10:00] <darksageaura> can someone tell me how to fix a problem with amarok I get every once in a while need to install mp3 support error
[10:00] <AWOSLappy> AlexExtreme, sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

[10:04] <yousseb> Good afternoon guys. I have a question regarding GRUB2. I understand it's experimental, but is there anyone who's using it today? I'd like to know how to load a splash image using it..
[10:04] <AWOSLappy> Does Edgy have better support for Broadcom chips?
[10:05] <neildarlow> cursedmind: do iwconfig and ifconfig show anything useful?
[10:05] <AWOSLappy> shwag: sudo cdrecord -scanbus
[10:05] <shwag> neildarlow: hm....in /etc/group   my user is in the cdrom group
[10:05] <neildarlow> AWOSLappy: i believe so. i'm unfortunate enough to be using ralink chips. they suck
[10:05] <ALi_> any ideas?
[10:05] <atzar> hi
[10:05] <neildarlow> AWOSLappy: one moment
[10:05] <Madeye> any idea how to setup my locale to English GB ?
[10:06] <atzar> I'm trying to install ubuntu edgy (i386) on a new MacBook
[10:06] <AWOSLappy> Madeye, um it's somewhere in Settings, I can't remember where
[10:06] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: did you try to use reinstall from synaptix?
[10:06] <AWOSLappy> atzar yay!
[10:06] <AWOSLappy> atzar what is the problem?
[10:06] <atzar> with the doc https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBook
[10:06] <neildarlow> AWOSLappy: it might be because you don't have cdrecord installed suid. dpkg-reconfigure can do that for you.
[10:06] <java1> frig blue screen of death
[10:06] <ERIK_LIMA> Yeah... I tried
[10:07] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I tried
[10:07] <ALi_> i have downloaded ubutu's live cd but it is so slow so i want to install it on my hardrive. I have tried the icon in the desktop but it wont work. is there any way i can install from commands at the beginning boot screen>?
[10:07] <atzar> but when I type this: grub> parttype (hd0,2) 0x83
[10:07] <atzar> it returns: Error 27: Unrecognized command
[10:07] <atzar> what can I do ?
[10:07] <shwag> AWOSLappy: neildarlow: sudo cdrecord -scanbus   works....it looks like its showing my usb hd on the scsibus though.  Maybe the usb disk is bringing up a scsi bus and interfering with cdrecords ability to detect and IDE cdburner ?
[10:07] <java1> back to drawing board
[10:07] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: The version 1.5 was working fine here
[10:07] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: The version 2.0 seems to be broken
[10:07] <neildarlow> shwag: cdrecord thinks in scsi. that's correct. reconfigure cdrecord suid
[10:07] <ERIK_LIMA> :(
[10:08] <shwag> neildarlow: well...isnt that what the  cdrom  group is for ?
[10:08] <Saulren2> Does Ubunto come with a telnet program?
[10:08] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, yes.
[10:08] <nofxx> how to format a partition to ext3 (or some recommendation?)  I already partitioned it with fdisk
[10:08] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: Firefox 2.0 ends every time when I try to view Orkut, for example
[10:08] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, how do I access it?
[10:08] <ERIK_LIMA> without my command to close it
[10:08] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, go in to the Terminal and type "telnet"
[10:08] <Saulren2> Thank you
[10:08] <neildarlow> AWOSLappy: burners are ATAPI which uses the SCSI command set. i believe it still needs suid perms for normal users
[10:09] <zukalk> neildarlow: sorry, i was afk. but that's a good question. the thing is... i can't remember whether i used a 686 kernel on this particular PC
[10:09] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: Can you open a terminal and try to run firefox?
[10:09] <Saulren2> Is there a better one I can download?
[10:10] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: Yes. But the problem persists
[10:10] <ALi_> how can i copy my ubuntu live cd to my hardrive please?
[10:10] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: Applications > Accessories > Terminal. Then type firefox. When it crashes, what's the error that you see?
[10:10] <aimtrainer> hi! Im running edgy on a samsng x11 and my wlan card ipw3945 is dedected now (eth1) after havning installed restricted modules. But I cant make it work. knetworkmanager doesnt even find it
[10:10] <baxter_kylie> How do I create an mdadm /dev/md[x]  device to assemble an array?
[10:10] <baxter_kylie> how do I establish a connection to a samba server in a parent subnet?
[10:10] <AWOSLappy> neildarlow, you are probably meaning to say this to shwag.  My IDE burner works 100% fine.
[10:10] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: Also, try firefox -safe-mode and let's see if that works..
[10:10] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: The Error is... The Browser closes automatically
[10:11] <AWOSLappy> neildarlow, I told him to do sudo cdrecord -scanbus because I must do sudo to get it to work.
[10:11] <shwag> neildarlow, AWOSLappy: /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd are both in the cdrom group, and I have two cdroms...one is a burner.  /dev/sg0
[10:11] <nofxx> talking about FF,, there a easy way to upgrade it to 2.0 ? i'm with 6.06
[10:11] <dk0r> What does 'ln -s' mean ?
[10:11] <eilker>  what is the difference between ubuntu and ubuntu-server ?  is the difference only lamp server ?
[10:11] <babwe> could some pls advise me what repo to use for realplay....im using firefox
[10:11] <nofxx> dk0r , will show another cool info to you.. about the contents of the folder
=== mikejr83 is now known as mgardner
[10:11] <neildarlow> shwag: why are you using SCSI emulation?
[10:12] <boink> dk0r: man ln
[10:12] <shwag> neildarlow: im not...except I have a USB hd plugged in.
[10:12] <neildarlow> shwag: ah, ok
[10:12] <dk0r> boink: ty
[10:12] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I'll try then
[10:12] <green_earz> ALi_: dd if=/dev/hdx of=/path.iso    have a look at your cat /etc/fstab  for the /dev of your cd-dvd drive
[10:12] <cursedmind> the ifocnfig gives me lots of things in the wifi section it unspec  and in the iwconfig  lot of no wireless extensions
[10:12] <ChrisJ> quick question, thought I'd try Ununtu on my AMD64.  Have now lost the original install media and can't remember if it was generic i386 or amd64 install
[10:12] <ChrisJ> is there a way I can find out
=== mgardner is now known as mikejr83
[10:12] <ChrisJ> plaease
[10:12] <caffiending> What is a good webpage creator foor 6.10?
[10:13] <shwag> neildarlow: guess I should file a bug.
[10:13] <boink> it's an amd64 CD/install
[10:13] <infidel> i wiped out my /boot partition how can i restore it?
[10:13] <ChrisJ> s/plaese/please/i
[10:13] <boink> you can use 32 bit on your amd64
[10:13] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: If that doesn't work, try the following: (Warning, this won't keep your bookmarks and settings and extension)      mv ~/.mozilla/ ~/.mozilla_back
[10:13] <AWOSLappy> dk0r, ln -s makes a soft link.  you may want to read the Wikipedia article - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ln_(Unix)
[10:13] <neildarlow> shwag: read the cdrecord manpage and search for suid. there's no bug
[10:13] <shwag> neildarlow: how do I..not use scsi emulation with cdrecord?
[10:13] <boink> caffieding: bluefish is nice
[10:14] <caffiending> boink: THanks!
[10:14] <AWOSLappy> ChrisJ -- uname -a
[10:14] <yousseb> infidel: You will most probably need to reinstall.. sorry dude
[10:14] <ChrisJ> AWOSLappy: thanks
[10:14] <ALi_> green_earz im tottaly new to linux, afraid i have no idea what you are on about!!
[10:14] <mikejr83> hey all, I am move to Ubuntu from Gentoo.  This is the first Linux desktop I've used with X.  I seem to have some display issues/questions.  What could be the main cause for a generally slow Gnome environment?
[10:15] <AWOSLappy> mikejr83, it's very RAM hungry.  how much RAM do you haev?
[10:15] <boink> mikejr83: you could try another window manager if gnome is too bloeaty
[10:15] <AWOSLappy> s/haev/have/
[10:15] <ChrisJ> AWOSLappy: it says i686, will i see much difference going to amd64, just using the box as a base os to run vmware machines on
[10:15] <yousseb> guys.. any idea where to look for documentation for grub2?
[10:15] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I think this problem is caused by a Flash Player plugin installed
[10:15] <boink> ChrisJ: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[10:15] <javiolo> mikejr83 try fluxbox
[10:16] <AWOSLappy> !msg
[10:16] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[10:16] <shwag> neildarlow: there is a bug as far as ubuntu being able to automatically be able to burn cd's without it breaking if a user plugs in a USB hd.
[10:16] <shwag> neildarlow: but i should figure out the solution first.
[10:16] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I don't really know where the problem is :(
[10:16] <ChrisJ> boink: I know what processor I've got and uname -a tells me what the kernel is compiled for, thanks AWOSLappy
[10:16] <sebsebseb> Two things here,  so Ubuntu AMSN and Ubuntu Gaim.   AMSN well  I got rid of everything from my comp a while ago now,  and since I had no Dapper or Edgy CD and I coudn't just download and use that would work.  I installed from an offical Breezy CD put in AMSN 0.94 from the respority and Internet update to Dapper.
[10:16] <sebsebseb> then Internet update to Edgy
[10:16] <shwag> neildarlow: this isnt a suid issue.
[10:17] <AWOSLappy> ChrisJ np :)
[10:17] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA:  Can you remove flash? Are you on edgy?
[10:17] <ERIK_LIMA> But, if the problem persists, I will reinstall my Dapper again. Oh, my God!! Two weeks trying to install ATI driver and nothing!
[10:17] <ALi_> dd if=/dev/hdx of=/path.iso have a look at your cat /etc/fstab for the /dev of your cd-dvd drive how do i do this?
[10:17] <sebsebseb> yes yes I know that AMSN is not suppourted by Ubuntu,  but this is from the respority so.  well it seems something buggered up when it upgraded Ubuntu with AMSN open so 0.94 to 0.95.  I get no display pics.
[10:17] <Yokanzo> is it possible to install limewire in 64bit ubuntu?
[10:17] <ERIK_LIMA> I'm on edgy
[10:17] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I'm on Edgy now
[10:17] <shwag> what is  /dev/sg0 ?
[10:17] <mikejr83> AWOSLappy: in response to the question of how much RAM is on this machine it is very small, 256Mb
[10:17] <shulman>  hi all -- I'm having trouble with Firefox 2.0 on Edgy (kubuntu) closing out constantly, mostly due to flash. I've tried applying the flash fix to the firefoxrc file without any success. Is there anything else that I should be doing to get flash to work properly?
[10:17] <neildarlow> shwag: ok
[10:18] <AWOSLappy> mikejr83, okay well that's not that bad, but it will be a little laggy.  What processor speed?
[10:18] <neildarlow> shwag: sgN used to be SCSI generic devices
[10:18] <mikejr83> AWOSLappy: I belive 2Ghz might be a few more
[10:18] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: do you have any browser working as of this point? Opera or Konqi?
[10:18] <ChrisJ> AWOSLappy: (+ everyone else) does anyone think its worth moving over to AMD64 kernel from I686 or is the performance not that much different?
[10:18] <CruCiaL-X> MarkN: those did not work, i keep getting error: dependency is not satisfiable: libbonobo2-Common / Ive installed the libbonobo2-Common deb package, any ideas?
[10:18] <green_earz> ALi_:   fire a console up so you got the command line
[10:18] <sebsebseb> and I tryed to remove AMSN including config file's with well commands package manager.  and then to just tell it to download and re install it.  well it seems it dosan't even download it,  it just has a DEB for it some where that it is already using.   I just want a new fresh download of AMSN from the respority and then clean install.
[10:18] <sebsebseb> anyone can help?
[10:18] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: No... :(
[10:18] <neildarlow> shulman: is this the flashplayer9-beta?
[10:19] <AWOSLappy> ChrisJ, I do not have a 64-bit computer, (nor AMD because the AMD I did have died prematurely so I will never get another AMD), so I have no clue.
[10:19] <shulman> neildarlow: Checking now... I installed the latest version off of apt-get
[10:19] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: Konqueror don't support Flash Player. So I can't see YouTube content
[10:19] <jbroome> sounds like a feature to me
[10:19] <AWOSLappy> yousseb, FYI, Konqi is the KDE dragon, Konq is the browser :P
[10:19] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I think only Firefox could do this
[10:19] <dk0r> Can anyone help me via pm install firefox 2.0 on 6.06? I'm new to linux.
[10:19] <babwe> sorry what repo to use for realplay
[10:19] <AWOSLappy> ERIK_LIMA -- lies!  Konqueror most certainly can support Flash!
[10:19] <kdcherli> Hello - If I'm on edgy, how would I be able to remove an "unknown interface (vmnet1)" in Networking tools section?
[10:19] <Yokanzo> I'm running a 64bit kernel and to be honest I hate it
[10:19] <yousseb> AWOSLappy: :D
[10:20] <CruCiaL-X> Could anyone pls help me with the gnome-network manager?
[10:20] <CruCiaL-X> Could anyone pls help me with the gnome-network manager?
[10:20] <neildarlow> shulman: it won't be then. the older flashplayer7 used to crash a lot for me too.
[10:20] <Saulren2> Question:   Where can I download/install a user friendly Telnet program?
[10:20] <Yokanzo> can't even install flash without hassle
[10:20] <AWOSLappy> !tell babwe about realplayer
[10:20] <ALi_> yes, and when i have done that....
[10:20] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: Actually, konq should be able to do so.. but let's see
[10:20] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, what, it didn't work?
[10:20] <yousseb> can you use konq to go here: http://getautomatix.com/wiki/index.php?title=Installation&Itemid=38
[10:20] <Saulren2> I can't seem to get it to
[10:20] <ERIK_LIMA> AWO: I tried one time when I used Kubuntu and doesn't work :(
[10:20] <shulman> neildarlow: should I manually install flash from macromedia then?
[10:20] <crimsun> Yokanzo: that's not true, either. You can install an older version of the Flash plugin just fine.
[10:20] <ChrisJ> Yokanzo: whats with the 64 bit kernel to hate
[10:20] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: Go here: http://getautomatix.com/wiki/index.php?title=Installation&Itemid=38 and get automatix
[10:20] <Saulren2> I can access the http part of the hostserv, so I know it is running
[10:20] <AWOSLappy> ERIK_LIMA I know, it's hard to get it to work correctly, but I have seen it done.
[10:20] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: once done, run it and make it install flash for you.. let's see if this fixes things..
[10:20] <neildarlow> shulman: i don't think you'll be any better off. the package installer does just that.
[10:20] <crimsun> Yokanzo: granted one would probably want the newer beta of Flash 9 for a better user experience...
[10:21] <ERIK_LIMA> First, I will try to run Firefox on safe mode
[10:21] <Lobotomie> how do i know where is installed azureus plz ?
[10:21] <ERIK_LIMA> If fails, I will install aonther browser
[10:21] <nalioth> tell dk0r about firefox
[10:21] <makeko> hi
[10:21] <neildarlow> ERIK_LIMA: have you tried epiphany?
[10:21] <nalioth> <sigh>
[10:21] <nalioth> dk0r: /msg ubotu firefox
[10:22] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy:  open 127.0.0.1:1138  -  could not resolve
[10:22] <dk0r> nalioth: I allready read the instructions. Can't get it.
[10:22] <AWOSLappy> Lobotomie, type      locate azureus     on the Terminal.
[10:22] <baxter_kylie> How do I create an mdadm /dev/md[x]  device to assemble an array?
[10:22] <baxter_kylie> how do I establish a connection to a samba server in a parent subnet?
[10:22] <Lobotomie> thx
[10:22] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, okay so you are trying to connect to your own machine at port 1138?
[10:22] <Yokanzo> I'm just a bit unhappy becuase theres mimimal w32 codec support and flash support
[10:22] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, right.
[10:22] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: you can invoke mdadm with a switch that automatically creates the device node
[10:22] <Yokanzo> and I don't even think i'll be able to use firefox 2.0
[10:22] <yousseb> Guys.. Anyone was able to get grub2 to load bitmaps or have any documentaion about it?
[10:22] <Yokanzo> They really gave us AMD64 guys the shaft
[10:23] <dk0r> Yokanzo: I can't even figure out how to install it.
[10:23] <Kingsqueak> Yokanzo: if that is your attitude you aren't ready to run 64, just install 32
[10:23] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow : What's the switch and will it destroy the existing data I have on the array?
[10:23] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, um, well, all the different telnet apps would do the same thing, so if it doesn't work on one it won't work on the others.
[10:23] <yousseb> Yokanzo: Get Automatix and make it install swiftfox.. binaries for each CPU
[10:23] <ChrisJ> Yokanzo: I'll not bother for now, rather have a slower machine that works than one that takes hours to tweak!  Just downgraded from 6.10 to 6.06 due to reported problems with VMware server
[10:23] <LjL> !automatix
[10:23] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[10:23] <ChrisJ> it sisn't occur to me at the time I could have tested 6.10 in a vmware machine!
[10:23] <AWOSLappy> ChrisJ, so you didn't even ATTEMPT to use VMware on 6.1?
[10:24] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: Strange!! In safe mode it's appear to work fine... :/
[10:24] <nalioth> dk0r: join us in #ubuntu-classroom please
[10:24] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, Its odd that the http serv is working, but not the telnet
[10:24] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: it's "-a"
[10:24] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: did you do the mv command that I sent you before?
[10:24] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: The browser did not end automatically...
[10:24] <ChrisJ> AWOSLappy: I was looking for the instructions
[10:24] <Kingsqueak> Yokanzo: there are workarounds, if you can't read about how to do them, then install 32bit. I've got plugins and firefox working fine on 64 here, just takes some readin
[10:24] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: No, I didn't...
[10:24] <dk0r> nalioth: Im there!
[10:24] <Lobotomie> how can i make firefox to open .torrent with azureus plz ?
[10:24] <Yokanzo> kingsqueak, where do I start?
[10:24] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, if I open the port 1138 instead of the http 1180 in firefox as a http, it gives me the proper login text and such, but Firefox is not a telnet app
[10:24] <Yokanzo> is there a tutorial?
[10:24] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I'm running Firefox in safe mode
[10:24] <Saulren2> So i can't do anything
[10:24] <ChrisJ> AWOSLappy: TBH If it works on 6.06 then that will do me fine
[10:25] <mumbles-potpal> If i use tar to creat an image of my windows drive will i be able just untar when i want to go back to the way it is now#?
[10:25] <compengi> how to install realplayer 10?
[10:25] <Kingsqueak> Yokanzo: try the forums for x86_64, they have FAQ's sticky posted there with how to work around it all
[10:25] <digilink> mumbles: yes
[10:25] <Yokanzo> great, thanks i'll look into that
[10:25] <ChrisJ> I can wait til christmas until its been sorted then switch over then
[10:25] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: When it runs in safe mode, it means that it didn't load plugins, extensions and themes.. the mv command will get themes and extensions out of the formula
[10:25] <baxter_kylie> neildarrow: it errors '... no /dev/md3 device present'
[10:25] <neildarlow> mumbles-potpal: be careful, tar has limitations on path lengths etc. test it well first
[10:25] <Kingsqueak> Yokanzo: my cut/paste is broken from firefox but it's ubuntuforums.org
[10:25] <yousseb> ERIK_LIMA: If it breaks after it, then it's plugin issue..
[10:25] <AleDream> ciao
[10:25] <AleDream> ragazzi
[10:26] <ChrisJ> can I get gaim to beep me when some one messages me?
[10:26] <mumbles-potpal> digilink neildarlow any particley pointers you can give me ?
[10:26] <Saulren2> Also, while I'm on the subject, how do I host my computer so that others can try to access that hostserv @ 1138?
[10:26] <ebiven> Gentlemen, I'm a Suse user looking for a new distro.  I'm having some issues with Ubuntu, mostly related to the network-manager-gnome applet and my Intel 2200BG not being recognized.  Anyone know of a good link to help me out?

[10:30] <qc_> does anyone know how to install/use the correct fonts in ubuntu to make bitchx display correctly with ANSI?
[10:30] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, my IP should be the same in Ubuntu as Windows,  right? i'm not sure how to check it in UBuntu
[10:30] <Nathan1993> BrightEyes: In recovery mode, run "apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
[10:30] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, um not necessarily
[10:30] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2 type     ifconfig

[10:33] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, I'm getting the same results.
[10:34] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2 okay.
[10:34] <CruCiaL-X> Nathan1993: i cant get the gnome-network-manager to install, it says it needs libbonobo2-Common, which i have installed, still saying it needs it, im running a dual boot, windows and ubunto, i need these files to setup a internet connection in ubuntu via my usb wireless adapter
[10:34] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, can you browse something for me?  camelotrealm.dyndns.org:1180
[10:34] <sinisterguy> what package would i need to be able to use the putfifo command?
[10:34] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, tell me if that works for you.
[10:34] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: Are you running xubuntu, kubuntu, or ubuntu?
[10:34] <neildarlow> CruCiaL-X: you don't have to use gnome-network-manager. i don't.
[10:35] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2 okay I will test now
[10:35] <topyli> BrightEyes`: what exactly did you install?
[10:35] <Saulren2> Thanks ^^
[10:35] <cablesm102> I feel really stupid... what's the IRC command for connecting to another server?
[10:35] <CruCiaL-X> Nathan1993: im running ubuntu

[10:35] <babwe> how do I do the dchroot for this one #
[10:35] <babwe> AMD64 architecture
[10:35] <babwe>     *
[10:35] <babwe>       The Windows Codecs package cannot be used directly by the AMD64 distribution. Some people solve this problem by installing the i386 Ubuntu distribution inside a chroot (for example, Linux Vserver or [WWW]  dchroot), and this works very well.
[10:35] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: hold on, please
[10:36] <WildZeck> cablesm102, /server eu.undernet.org 6667
[10:36] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow: same error '... no /dev/md3 device or address present'
[10:36] <cablesm102> WildZeck, thanks
[10:36] <neildarlow> CruCiaL-X: just configure your interface in /etc/network/interfaces
[10:36] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: Do you get a interface (eg wlan0)
[10:36] <WildZeck> you're welcome
[10:36] <BrightEyes`> topyli: all the packs about xfce
[10:36] <java1> ok after failed install with live cd downloaded alt install cd and tryied text install no go
[10:36] <java1> any one?
[10:37] <BrightEyes`> topyli: is there anything i can do???
[10:37] <CruCiaL-X> Nathan1993: yup, it says wlan0, essid BT HomeHub and ive put the WEP key in, but how do i connect?
[10:37] <AWOSLappy> Well, Saulren2, the DNS points to 192.168.1.102 -- e.g. a local IP.  I can't connect to it.
[10:37] <WildZeck> java1, do you check that your cdrom was not corrupted ?
[10:37] <java1> yes
[10:37] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: i can only suggest reading the mdadm manpage. i've never needed to resort to using mdadm directly on ubuntu
[10:37] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, ah, I can't remember how to host a server.   I can only access it when In Ubuntu, not over my win32 OS
[10:37] <Nathan1993> CruCial-X: You are going to have to manually edit the /etc/network/interfaces file. It's not that hard, I do it by hand. I'm trying to find a site that has some doc on it that you can print out and use.
[10:38] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, regardless, I can't access the telnet service part of it.
[10:38] <java1> 0 checksum erorrs
[10:38] <alecjw> anyone know of any good video broadcasting programs?
[10:38] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow: Ugh. Manpage says the same things you did.
[10:38] <CruCiaL-X> Nathan1993: k thanx
[10:38] <topyli> BrightEyes`: you looked up all packages with xfce in their names and installed? it might mean you don't have a window manager, no file manager, and whatnot
[10:38] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: how was your array created?
[10:38] <BrightEyes`> i have the menus above
[10:39] <BrightEyes`> topyli: that menu with rat.and i can see time as well
[10:39] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow: with mdadm a year or so ago on a debian system
[10:39] <Amibal> hi
=== funkyHat is now known as funkyHat|away
[10:39] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, okay.  :)  Well do you have the telnet server correctly configured?
[10:39] <topyli> BrightEyes`: ah so you do see more than just a blue desktop :)
[10:39] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: are you using lilo?
[10:39] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow: grub. It's just media storage, though -- nothing is booting off these drives
[10:40] <BrightEyes`> topyli: when im trying to go to setting and i chose the settings manager it doesnt show up anything
[10:40] <Amibal> can i ask you some question.. i'm french and its difficult to understand everything... i have windows xp and i think about changing for ubuntu. Can someone answer my questions?
[10:40] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, well I'm assuming so.  when I go to port 1138 (telnet port) in firefox, it brings up the Telnet responses
[10:40] <CPrgmSwR2> what intsall based is ubuntu
[10:40] <CPrgmSwR2> is it rpm based src based
[10:40] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, however I cannot input anything through Firefox
[10:40] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, hmm.  and telnet doesn't work?
[10:40] <alecjw> anyone know of any good video broadcasting programs?
[10:40] <topyli> BrightEyes`: you probably don't have a session manager or some other part of the desktop installed
[10:40] <ERIK_LIMA> yousseb: I tried to install the ATI driver but doesnt't work
[10:41] <topyli> BrightEyes`: see if you installed the xfce4 package
[10:41] <linopil> CPrgmSwR2:  debian apt
[10:41] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: how about creating an /etc/mdadm.conf that describes the array then use mdadm's autostart feature to start it?
[10:41] <Nathan1993> CruCiaL-X: Go to http://rafb.net/paste/results/SyntEO53.html. It should give you a good idea of what to do. Just replace rausb0 with your interface name (I think you said it was wlan0). Then, from the terminal, run "ifup wlan0" (or whatever else your interface name is). Then viola! After a short DHCP session, you should have wireless connections
[10:41] <Amibal> huu sorry but can somebody answer me?
[10:41] <CPrgmSwR2> so can you do apt-get gyachi?
[10:41] <java1> Well will go back to forums and wait there
[10:41] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, says name or service unknown
[10:41] <BrightEyes`> topyli: which of all is the session manager?
[10:41] <WildZeck> java1 so i dunno, it's never fail here
[10:41] <linopil> what is gyachi ?
[10:41] <Yokanzo> I got a bug trying to upgrade
[10:41] <CPrgmSwR2> gyach improved
[10:41] <Yokanzo> it told me it oculd not calculate the upgrade
[10:41] <CPrgmSwR2> a fork off of gyach
[10:41] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, which is why I wante to try a diff telnet program incase the telnet included doesn't recognize the protocol or something.
[10:41] <java1> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=298264
[10:41] <baxter_kylie> neildarlow: already have the mdadm.conf autostart also complains about the lack of an md device
[10:42] <java1> posted every thing there
[10:42] <Amibal> is it possible to execute some .exe with ubuntu?
[10:42] <topyli> BrightEyes`: probably xfce4-session. you also need xfce4-mcs-plugins
[10:42] <CPrgmSwR2> can you install stuff through rpm packages though?
[10:42] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, since firefox obviously recognizes the protocol, but is unable to interact with it.
[10:42] <alecjw> anyone know of any good video broadcasting programs?
[10:42] <topyli> BrightEyes`: don't hunt them down one by one. install xfce4 that's all
[10:42] <nofxx> Amibal , maybe with wine you can run your exe
[10:42] <CruCiaL-X> Nathan1993: thanx, ill try that now
[10:42] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, does netcat work?
[10:42] <BrightEyes`> topyli: now im updating the whole system.ive installed alla about xfce. i dont know if its version 4
[10:42] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, what would actually be more convenient for me is to be able to access it through my windows platform using Pueblo
[10:42] <Tater> is there a default partition scheme that ubuntu uses and if so what is it and the filesystems used on each partition?
[10:43] <Shaezsche> how can i adjust my fans?
[10:43] <java1> wish there was an way to track each funtion its was doing to debug
[10:43] <BrightEyes`> topyli: i yesterday installed Xfce on my desktop(using open suse 10.1) and it was ok
[10:43] <Amibal> nofx, i dont know ubuntu i run with windowsxp can you help me?
[10:43] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, it prompts me for a cmd line
[10:43] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, I have no clue how you would set that up.
[10:43] <topyli> BrightEyes`: install the package called xfce4 and be done with it :)
[10:43] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, try this:    netcat -t 127.0.0.1 1138
[10:43] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: doh! is the appropriate raid module loaded?
[10:43] <BrightEyes`> topyli: my acer aspire 5000 doesnt have an nvidia driver.what can i do for better graphics?
[10:43] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, I used to have my computer as a host, so anyone could access it.
[10:43] <Shaezsche> i want some fan speed controls!?!?!?!
[10:43] <mne> hi, the ubuntu bug reporting tool created a bug report file. what should I do with that file, how can I send it to the BTS ?
[10:43] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy I dont know how to set up my hostserv in Ubuntu
[10:43] <Saulren2> Ok, I will try it
[10:43] <BrightEyes`> topyli: why not installing all about Xfce.except some burning tools etc
[10:44] <Amibal> ya des franais ici?
[10:44] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, I'm not sure either, I don't know how dynamic DNS things work.
[10:44] <AWOSLappy> !fr | Amibal
[10:44] <ubotu> Amibal: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[10:44] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, netcat works
[10:44] <Amibal> merci je savai pa
[10:44] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, okay netcat works good.
[10:44] <topyli> BrightEyes`: xfce4 is a metapackage which depends on all parts of the xfce desktop. it will install all the packages you want
[10:44] <neildarlow> baxter_kylie: it might be as simple as adding e.g. raid1 to /etc/modules
[10:45] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, how do input with netcat?
[10:45] <topyli> BrightEyes`: but if you're going to be using xfce as your primary desktop, why not just install xubuntu-desktop which has a nice set of apps too
[10:45] <linopil> eth0 is down again. why?
[10:45] <alecjw> Tater: ubuntu, by default, makes a / partition formatted in ext3 which fills modt of the drive   and a swap partition which fills the rest. the swap's in a logical drive
[10:45] <intelikey> i've got something hosed.... i just installed ubuntu and kde and was test running things before i turn it over to it's owner... the three user accounts will use different desktops gnome kde and blackbox   the first run went ok but the second login for bb ; X tripped out and i wanted to test grub settings anyway so i rebooted.  now all i can get for any user is an rxvt terminal   setting the session does nothing to affect th

[10:45] <dsl921> anybody know how to change referesh rate with DSL linux?
[10:45] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, nevermind its working now.
[10:45] <gkelly> Has anyone had any luck with wifi on the new MacBook Pros?
[10:45] <linopil> how to take eth0 up
[10:45] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, now try       telnet 127.0.0.1 1138
[10:46] <neildarlow> alecjw: gstreamer but you need a server and good bandwidth
[10:46] <AWOSLappy> linopil, sudo ifconfig eth0 up
[10:46] <linopil> okay
[10:46] <Tater> alecjw, ok thanks ext3 eh, I'm trying to mount a hdd that was inmy laptop on my desktop pc so I can pull some files from it and then wipe it and install edgy
[10:46] <topyli> BrightEyes`: if you simply go hunting for packages with xfce in their names, you won't even have a file manager (which is called thunar)
[10:46] <Amibal> how do we change chan?
[10:46] <intelikey> i'll be in #kubuntu  if anyone knows what i need to do to that.
[10:46] <linnuxxy> how can upgrade to 6.10... i have 6.06 now?is there an apt command or something?
[10:46] <CPrgmSwR2> can you install src based packages in ubuntu
[10:46] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, thanks man!
[10:46] <Flannel> CPrgmSwR2: sure
[10:46] <Saulren2> Now I just need to figure out how to host my computer.
[10:46] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2 np :)
[10:47] <alecjw> neildarlow: does gstreamer have a gui? if so, how do i install it?
[10:47] <CPrgmSwR2> I have a friend that is trying to install gyachi
[10:47] <BrightEyes`> topyli: i just opened thunar
[10:47] <linopil> AWOSLappy: ty
[10:47] <AWOSLappy> Saulren2, for netcat?  or does "telnet" now magically work?
[10:47] <CPrgmSwR2> and it says c compile cannot create executables
[10:47] <AWOSLappy> linopil np :)
[10:47] <neildarlow> alecjw: unlikely. it's a streaming server.
[10:47] <linopil> but still no IPv4 address
[10:47] <Flannel> !compile | CPrgmSwR2
[10:47] <ubotu> CPrgmSwR2: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[10:47] <topyli> BrightEyes`: good
[10:47] <alecjw> neildarlow: ok. thanks
[10:48] <linopil> is it IPv6 overrules IPv4 in linux?
[10:48] <CPrgmSwR2> he tried an rpm package
[10:48] <Saulren2> AWOSLappy, using netcat, I guess..  I think that perhaps my syntax in telnet was wrong.. should it have been:  open 127.0.0.1 1138   /or/   open 127.0.0.1:1138
[10:48] <CPrgmSwR2> that didn't work
[10:48] <CPrgmSwR2> so what kinda package is a pre-built one for ubuntu
[10:48] <neildarlow> linopil: they coexist.
[10:48] <linopil> neildarlow: I also thought so
[10:48] <Flannel> CPrgmSwR2: a deb

[10:50] <linopil> ok

[10:53] <neildarlow> linopil: sorry, that's "iface eth0 dhcp"
[10:53] <kzm_> But it failed, it was too small.

[10:58] <neildarlow> Chetic: maybe you're not using DRI for some reason
[10:58] <[VCO] InfamousFla> lol kzm_ :P. Anyone got any ideas on my problem?
[10:58] <segosa> what file contains the network interfaces' configuration?
[10:58] <babwe> how do I install the windows codec package inside a shroot
[10:58] <Chetic> neildarlow, how do I check?
[10:58] <Saulren2> neildarlow: It is currently listening on port 1138
[10:58] <linopil> sure also mask of interfaces is 644
[10:58] <leleobhz> Chetic: fglrxinfo
[10:58] <mattthebaker> what is the procedure for installing newer versions of an application before it is in the package tree for your ubuntu release? search for debs from the unstable dist?
[10:58] <linopil> neildarlow: ?
[10:58] <leleobhz> see if DRI are enabled
[10:59] <Chetic> leleobhz, It isn't.. So now what?
[10:59] <linopil> Iam in ubuntu gnome neildarlow howto automate eth0 then ?
[10:59] <CPrgmSwR2> how do you tell a freind to install xchat
[10:59] <neildarlow> Saulren2: do you have a domain name that has DNS setup to resolve your IP for services e.g. www.yourdomain.com?
[10:59] <leleobhz> Chetic: see why
[10:59] <leleobhz> Chetic: see the /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[10:59] <CPrgmSwR2> is it apt-get install xchat
[10:59] <ryanpg> so if ubuntu is using UUIDs now, why when I run update-grub are all the UUIDs replaced with /dev/sdaX ?
[11:00] <linopil> CPrgmSwR2:  sudo apt-get install xchat ?
[11:00] <topyli> mattthebaker: you build backports on your stable system and hope they don't bite you when you try to upgrade some day
[11:00] <AWOSLappy> Whoa whoa whoa wait.  You can disable DRI?
[11:01] <neildarlow> linopil: two separate lines in /etc/network/interfaces: || auto eth0 || iface eth0 inet dhcp
[11:01] <utab> hi there I would like to connect to a remote machine with ssh but I am getting an error related to port 22
[11:01] <CPrgmSwR2> says it cannot find the package xchat
[11:01] <Saulren2> neildarlow:  camelotrealm.dyndns.org:1180  is the http   :1138 is the telnet
[11:01] <Saulren2> I have no problems accessing either
[11:01] <linopil> ok neildarlow vi edit it ?
[11:01] <printk> AWOSLappy: of coure.  edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and look just disable the loading of dri
[11:01] <neildarlow> linopil: sudo vi
[11:01] <linopil> okay
[11:01] <AWOSLappy> printk, would this make it faster?
[11:02] <mattthebaker> topyli: when you say build backports, do you mean there is a backport repository with said unstable packages? or do i grab the source/binary and build it by hand following some procedure?
[11:02] <Chetic> leleobhz, (WW) fglrx(0): Kernel Module version does *not* match driver.
[11:02] <Chetic> (EE) fglrx(0): incompatible kernel module detected - HW accelerated OpenGL will not work
[11:02] <printk> AWOSLappy: make what faster?  I'd assume it'd make things slower
[11:02] <utab> I can ping the remote machine can not connect that
[11:02] <neildarlow> linopil: the entry for lo will give you an idea of format
[11:02] <printk> AWOSLappy: disabling would make slower i mean
[11:03] <eXistenZ> linopil, what font do you use for application?
[11:03] <topyli> mattthebaker: you get source packages from the unstable distribution and build binaries from them on your stable system
[11:03] <kestaz> what can i do if my laptop is broken battery state, compile kernel ?
[11:03] <mattthebaker> topyli: thanks
[11:03] <printk> kestaz: broken battery state?   Isn't that a battery issue?

[11:04] <neildarlow> Saulren2: i can't connect to the http port. are you sure it's listening on 1180?
[11:04] <CPrgmSwR2> what irc client do most of yall use
[11:04] <mattthebaker> topyli: heh, its a fairly fresh install, and my home directory is on a different partition, so if worst comes to worse, no harm done :D
[11:04] <linopil> trying to  solve eth0 down problem
[11:04] <Saulren2> neildarlow:  I guess.   I can access both ports, but only in Ubuntu, not in windows, which tells me its localized.
[11:05] <Saulren2> neildarlow:  I dont know how to make it globalized
[11:05] <utab> ssh help  needed. Can ping a remote machine but can not connect
[11:05] <linopil> still no joy neildarlow
[11:05] <AWOSLappy> CPrgmSwR2, Konversation for me.
[11:05] <neildarlow> Saulren2: perhaps it's listening on your internal network and not the external interface
[11:05] <eck> utab: maybe it is not running sshd?
[11:05] <printk> utab: need more info than that, what errors do you get?  what is keeping you from connecting?  is it behind a router?  etc etc
[11:05] <topyli> mattthebaker: better get source debs though, and be careful to build binary debs. we don't want to confuse the package system
[11:06] <utab> printk, I do not know I want to learn that
[11:06] <neildarlow> linopil: you did /etc/init.d/networking restart ? does ifconfig show anything?

[11:07] <Gunblader> Hi, has anyone tried installing ubuntu on a philips x56 laptop before? I'm having some hardware detection problems on installation ;_;
[11:07] <printk> utab: I did ask you 3
[11:07] <eck> utab: i would recommend doing a port scan with nmap to make sure that you can see/access port 22
[11:07] <mick> i have a hard drive with multiple partitions, one of them being mounted at /media/hda4  as ext3, but i do not have permissions to write to the drive... can anyone help me out?
[11:07] <AWOSLappy> caffiending, have you tried Mozilla Composer?
[11:07] <jrib> caffiending: f-spot works nicely, you can export to web galleries such as flickr or picasa web, or create your own html one
[11:07] <Saulren2> neildarlow: How do I get it to listen on external ports?
[11:08] <neildarlow> caffiending: what flavour of ubuntu do you run?
[11:08] <caffiending> ubuntu 6.10 edgy.
[11:08] <linopil> okay
[11:08] <neildarlow> Saulren2: the configuration usually specifies which interfaces/IPs to bind to. might be something like 0.0.0.0?
[11:08] <linopil> neil  I only did ifconfig down up
[11:09] <Ahmuck> AWOSLappy: bluefish
[11:09] <caffiending> I would like to share all the pics (1000+) and have my friends be ablel to download the entird "lot" if possible
[11:09] <neildarlow> linopil: try the restart
[11:09] <AWOSLappy> Ahmuck huh?
[11:09] <Saulren2> neildarlow: Perhaps it is the driver that is limiting where it will listen, but I dont ever remember having to change that.
[11:09] <utab> eck, how can i do that, because i am getting a message related to port22
[11:09] <caffiending> I just tried bluefish and was having an error on install.  the MD5 on the DVD was bad.  can I just download it?
[11:09] <meeuro1> anyone know why i get Error dependency is not satisfiable:libgail17
[11:09] <Saulren2> neildarlow: It has been a long while since I ran this driver.
[11:09] <eck> utab: what is the message?
[11:10] <Ahmuck> caffiending: yes, you can  apt-get install bluefish
[11:10] <Ahmuck> you will need universe, multiverse
[11:10] <neildarlow> caffiending: programs like f-spot (GNOME) and digikam (KDE) have gallery creation functions builtin
[11:10] <meeuro1> Error dependency is not satisfiable:libgail17  got it when trying to install gyachi_1.0.5-1_dapper_i386.deb
[11:10] <linopil> neildarlow: good for you
[11:11] <Ahmuck> caffiending: yes, i think f-spot or digikam is what your looking for
[11:11] <phoenixz> Is there anybody who knows a bit about lvm? vgcfgrestore -t -f /etc/lvm/backup/VolGroupi00 VolGroup00 gives me "Parse error at line 93: unexpected token" but the config file only has 88 lines.. Is there anybody who could tell me what is wrong here?
[11:11] <neildarlow> linopil: is it working now?
[11:11] <linopil> final question what is the reason auto is not a default for eth0 ?
[11:11] <Saulren2> neildarlow: there is no application I need to run to allow people to access my IP?
[11:11] <linopil> yep pinging www.yahoo.com
[11:11] <utab> ssh: connect to host 10.... port 22: Connection refused
[11:12] <utab> eck, ssh: connect to host 10.... port 22: Connection refused
[11:12] <neildarlow> linopil: you might have a system with removable interfaces. you shouldn't assume presence at startup
[11:12] <linopil> so neildarlow , do you know why distro installs won't put that auto dhcp on eth0 ?
[11:12] <derek_> sorry to interrupt, but I am a newbie to linux , my g++ compiler compiles fine but when I name a program for example "colorcode", when I type in colorcode at the terminal it gives me abash error
[11:12] <eck> utab: i am guessing your firewall on the remote host is blocking traffic on that port
[11:12] <eck> if it is behind a NAT, make sure you have port forwarding properly configured
[11:13] <linopil> how does ubuntu install decide realtek 8139 is a removable
[11:13] <utab> utab: should I ask my admin for which port to use
[11:13] <caffiending> Great, I would like to create a gallery, then be able to have them click on the file to see the lardge pic.  (my pics are ~4.5M)
[11:13] <mister_roboto> derek: probably the current dir is not in your path and you're trying to run it from same dir?  try typing "./colorcode"
[11:13] <neildarlow> linopil: perhaps, for some reason, the network configuration step of the installation failed? or you said leave it for later?
[11:13] <linopil> windows always assumes auto dhcp neildarlow
[11:13] <utab> eck, should I ask my admin for which port to use
[11:13] <linopil> I expect linux to be the same and better neildarlow
[11:13] <eck> utab: possibly sshd is running on another port (you can check with 'sudo nmap -A foo.bar.com')
[11:13] <neildarlow> linopil: the ubuntu installation does, usually, get it right.
[11:14] <AWOSLappy> derek_, try ./a.out
[11:14] <linopil> OK for what I know it happened many times also on fedora
[11:14] <derek_> thanks
[11:14] <caffiending> Is there a way to allow th user to d/l the entire gallery (full size images) not thumbnails?
[11:14] <utab> eck, what is the meaning for this
[11:14] <kitche> utab: if you don't control that server I would ask the admin just to be safe since if they see a scan from a pc from you you might get in trouble
[11:15] <linopil> maybe frequent hardware changes ( this is a lab) on PCs do this to nistall neildarlow ?
[11:15] <buzzy> ragazzi ora sembrea che vada....bah
[11:15] <neildarlow> caffiending: a gallery is usually composed of thumbnails for convenience. who wants to scroll a whopping image?
[11:15] <meeuro1_> Error ependency is not satisfiable:libgail17  when installing gyachi_1.0.5-1_dapper_i386.deb
[11:15] <meeuro1_> anyone know why?
[11:15] <neildarlow> linopil: maybe. at least it's working now.
=== james is now known as njan
[11:15] <derek_> it works with a.out and ./colorcode but when I type in ls it shows that the program "colorcode" is in that dir so why do I have to type ./colorcode for  it to work?
[11:15] <phoenixz> is there anybody who knows a bit about lvm? Logical Volume Management?
[11:15] <linopil> anyways you understood my q. helped me neil and yu are my favorite
[11:16] <eck> utab: it would scan the ports on the other computer and try to see what services you can see running on which ports on that computer... as kitche said, there is a (small) possibility that you could be blocked from connecting if the admin sees you port scanning
[11:16] <neildarlow> phoenixz: yes
[11:16] <utab> kitche, I will do that definitely but is that the reason
[11:16] <bruenig> meeuro1, libgail18 is available
[11:16] <kestaz> how to get new kernel with apt-get ?
[11:16] <jrib> derek_: . is not in your path
[11:16] <phoenixz> neildarlow: Do you know anything about vgcfgrestore?
[11:16] <derek_> jrib: what do you mean?
[11:16] <kestaz> how to get new kernel with apt-get ?
[11:16] <soundray> kestaz: don't repeat please
[11:17] <kestaz> so answer
[11:17] <neildarlow> phoenixz: yikes, no. you mean you've got a broken lvm/
[11:17] <meeuro1_> Error ependency is not satisfiable:libgail17  anyone know what i need to fix this in edgy?
[11:17] <jrib> derek_: when you just type a command, it searches the directories in your $PATH  (try 'echo $PATH')
[11:17] <bruenig> meeuro1, you could try to install libgail18, that is all that is available in the repos
[11:17] <utab> eck, that is my machine in my room at the university so my only intention is to be able to connect there not to harm they will know that so we are secure
[11:17] <ailean> guys, I have boot problems. Although GRUB is installed correctly, my second (slave) hard disc with Windows on it overrules it.  What do I do to fix it?
[11:18] <kitche> utab: if it's a university they have port 22 blocked usually
[11:18] <jrib> derek_: but if you specify a path to the command, then your shell doesn't search.  So you can do  /foo/bar/file.sh  or bar/file.sh if you are in /foo or ./file.sh if you are in /foo/bar  since '.' means your current directory
[11:18] <phoenixz> neildarlow: Yeah.. and actually not even ubuntu, but I dont get ANY response in any channel.. Ive done quite some work on restoring it already, I know what caused it, how to repair it, only the repair tool isn't working along
[11:18] <derek_> jrib: so if I type in ls wont that show what is int he dir I am in?
[11:18] <eck> kitche: not at my school :-)
[11:18] <jrib> derek_: yes
[11:18] <soundray> ailean: how do you mean grub is installed "correctly"?
[11:18] <kitche> eck: do you go to a college or a university :)
[11:19] <eck> kitche: UC Berkeley
[11:19] <derek_> jrib: colorcode appears but wont run with just the command colorcode
[11:19] <kitche> eck: that's why :)
[11:19] <utab> kitche, that is a university
[11:19] <Saulren2> neildarlow:  I'm looking under network settings> Host tab, should I add a host?
[11:19] <ailean> soundray without the 2nd HDD attached, it loads up
[11:19] <Saulren2> neildarlow:  with my current IP
[11:19] <jrib> derek_: do you understand what I explained about the $PATH?
[11:19] <kitche> utab: yes I know what Berkeley is
[11:19] <derek_> I typed it in and it listed a long path
[11:19] <soundray> ailean: so when you connect the slave drive, the BIOS boots from that one?
[11:20] <ailean> soundray and the first time i loaded it, I could load Windows from it - but that changed everything
[11:20] <bruenig> oht, I have had that before, but it was my . key
[11:20] <ailean> soundray yeah, i suppose so
[11:20] <eck> utab: regardless, i would be very surprised if you got blocked for port scanning... normally there is so much background noise from all the bots running all over the net doing port scans that people don't bother with it anymore
[11:20] <neildarlow> Saulren2: is your external interface up-and-running? does ifconfig show it as being so?
[11:20] <caffiending> Neildarlow: yes, that is why I want a thumbnail gallery, but my friends on the trip want to be able to print out HQ pics
[11:20] <samyboy> Hi there, I have a problem setting up an lvm volume :

=== atlas95 is now known as Atlas-Zzz
[11:20] <samyboy> what does that mean ?
[11:20] <oht> bruenig: heh, it happened after setting a gnome keyborad shortcut for shift+z, but then disabling it, after i disabled the shortcut, my z key did nothing until i rebooted
[11:20] <jrib> derek_: yes, when you type a command, your shell searches those directories in $PATH.  And notice that '.' (which means whatever directory you are currently in) is not listed there.  So your shell won't find colorcode in the current directory because it doesn't look there
[11:20] <utab> eck, with nmap, what should I do
[11:20] <neildarlow> caffiending: they can right-click and download then print in some application
[11:20] <soundray> ailean: perhaps you should install grub to the slave drive as well, overwriting the Windows bootloader
[11:20] <kitche> utab: are you doing this within the network or outside since they catch inside traffic more for scanning
[11:21] <neildarlow> caffiending: or just click in their browser to open the picture and then print it
[11:21] <bruenig> oht, same thing, Set a shortcut. Removed, and then had to reboot to get it back. My shortcut was ctrl + .

[11:31] <eck> utab: for example, the web site for my work is rescomp.berkeley.edu, but when I ssh in I have to connect to hal.rescomp.berkeley.edu, a different computer on the subnet
[11:31] <swim_> hello, I have recently followed the berylonedgy (from the ubuntu.com wiki) I rebooted, but now if I try to login to gnome, I simply get a blank screen after gdm login. Also I do not get an option for beryl when trying to select from 'session' in gdm.
[11:31] <aridese> hey guys, what would cause ubuntu GNOME to hang on boot after login? i.e, mouse cursor boots, nothing happens
[11:31] <ailean> soundray, well, GRUB pretends that it is the master disc
[11:31] <aridese> mouse cursor moves
[11:31] <kitche> rogue780: since ubuntu doesn't hava java by default
[11:31] <ailean> soundray but i don't think GRUB is even loading

[11:32] <TLE> Hey, on my edgy desktop are shotcuts to the partitions I have mounted in /media/ but how do I change which partition have shortcuts and change the shortcuts names ?
[11:32] <rogue780> !java
[11:32] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[11:32] <Yokanzo> !frostwire
[11:32] <ubotu> frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
[11:32] <swim_> hello, I have recently followed the berylonedgy (from the ubuntu.com wiki) I rebooted, but now if I try to login to gnome, I simply get a blank screen after gdm login. Also I do not get an option for beryl when trying to select from 'session' in gdm.
[11:32] <infidel> aridese thanks
[11:33] <mc__> !eclipse > mc__
[11:33] <eck> utab: is it this? http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/system/security/remote/
[11:33] <Jowi> aridese, instead of logging in directly after boot; press alt-ctrl-F1 to go to a console. add a new user there "sudo adduser test". switch back to the login screen with ctrl-alt-F7 and login with the "test" user. if that works then you know it is only your account that is affected.
[11:33] <mc__> guys which packages do i need to install under edgy to get a natice eclipse?
[11:33] <mc__> i installed eclipse-gcj and eclipse-jdt,but there is no eclipse binary

[11:34] <swim_> ...anyone?
[11:34] <court> hey, I need some help with ndiswrapper? anyone a guru?
[11:34] <mc__> kitche, that wont give me an interpreted version?
[11:34] <meeuro1_> when launching the install file for gyachi i get Dependency not satisfiable libmcrypt4 any clue?
[11:35] <mc__> kitche, i really need the native one
[11:35] <Jowi> infidel, see if the grub troubleshooting guide can help you
[11:35] <Jowi> !grub
[11:35] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[11:35] <kitche> mc__: what do you mean native one since eclipse is the native one
[11:35] <meeuro1_> when launching the install file for gyachi i get Dependency not satisfiable libmcrypt4 any clue?
[11:36] <mc__> kitche, eclipse can be compiled to native or interpreted by a jvm, i need the compiled version
[11:36] <court> it seems ndiswrapper isnt wokring correctly
[11:36] <Jowi> meeuro1, "sudo apt-get install libmcrypt4" maybe?
[11:36] <utab> eck, yes it looks that I have to learn the port #
[11:36] <kitche> mc__: well eclipse is the compiled version
[11:36] <meeuro1_> Jowi : cant find package libmcrypt4
[11:36] <oht> is there a bit torrent client for linux that allows you to enable header encryption?
[11:37] <kitche> !libmcrypt4
[11:37] <ubotu> libmcrypt4: De-/Encryption Library. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.5.7-5 (edgy), package size 77 kB, installed size 256 kB
[11:37] <dk0r> Anyone want to help me get firefox2 installed on 6.06? The instructions online are incorrect and poorly written.
[11:37] <mc__> kitche, thank you!
[11:37] <Jowi> !info libmcrypt4
[11:37] <offby1> dk0r: I think you can just download a binary and unpack it
[11:37] <meeuro1_> wonder why it sais package doesnt exist?
[11:37] <Jowi> meeuro1, enable universe repository
[11:37] <Jowi> !universe
[11:37] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[11:37] <utab> eck, the only thing I want to do is to be able to use some licensed software
[11:38] <dk0r> Yeah, but Im having troubles getting it to be seen as the default version of firefox.
[11:38] <offby1> dk0r: ah
[11:38] <offby1> no idea then :-|
[11:38] <offby1> maybe something under the "Preferences" menu
[11:38] <kitche> mc__: no matter what you will need java runtime enviroment to run eclipse anyways
[11:38] <meeuro1_> meeuro1@meeuro1-desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install libmcrypt4
[11:38] <meeuro1_> Reading package lists... Done
[11:38] <meeuro1_> Building dependency tree
[11:38] <meeuro1_> Reading state information... Done
[11:38] <meeuro1_> E: Couldn't find package libmcrypt4
[11:38] <eck> utab: if you know the correct host/port and still can't connect, contact the admin
[11:38] <kitche> meeuro1_: do you have universe repo enabled
[11:38] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell meeuro1_ about pastebin
[11:38] <court> anyone fluent with ndiswrapper?
[11:39] <meeuro1_> kitche whats universe repo?
[11:39] <utab> eck, the problem is the first, I do not know the port #, and port 22 is not the one
[11:39] <boink> !apt-get
[11:39] <ubotu> apt is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto  -  Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[11:39] <mc__> kitche, yeah,but not only classpath and gcj i  hope?
[11:39] <aridese> why would ubuntu hang after login? the mouse cursor moves, but nothing happens
[11:39] <Yokanzo> How do get IME style japanese input for ubuntu?
[11:39] <Yokanzo> so I can type in japanese
[11:39] <Yokanzo> much like the XP language bar
[11:39] <boink> !tell meuro1_ about apt-get
[11:40] <boink> Yokanzo: scim
[11:40] <bintara> !ntfs-3g
[11:40] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[11:40] <Yokanzo> scim?
[11:40] <boink> !scim
[11:40] <ubotu> Chinese, Japanese, Korean Language input. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SCIM
[11:40] <Yokanzo> Thanks
[11:40] <Yokanzo> it seems ubuntu is significantly different from other distros that it requires its own version of everything
=== Nikolas_ is now known as Nikolas
[11:40] <kitche> mc__: I don't use gcj myself I just use the Java compiler since gcj is gnu's java compiler

[11:40] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with a partition problem pls?
[11:41] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with a partition problem pls?
[11:41] <boink> Yokanzo: ubuntu isn't that different from debian
[11:41] <boink> !ask
[11:41] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:41] <court> anyone good with ndiswrapper?
[11:41] <Yokanzo> boink, it will support most linux applications right?
[11:41] <boink> Yokanzo: well, use apt-get :)
[11:41] <kitche> Yokanzo: it just does it a different way the packages and such
[11:41] <Yokanzo> I actually moved over to ubuntu from gentoo because I had trouble setting up higher resolutions and destroyed my kernel
[11:41] <Yokanzo> apt-get is like emerge isn't it?
[11:41] <matiu> What's the easiest way to get back to dapper from edgy?
[11:41] <boink> apt-get is the debian emerge, yes
[11:41] <Yokanzo> sweet
[11:41] <kitche> Ubotu tell matiu about downgrade
[11:42] <boink> duh ...gentoo emerge, I mean
[11:42] <matiu> Yokanzo, actually apt-source is like emerge, apt-get is like emerge -K (or whatever it is to get binaries)
[11:42] <CruCiaL-X> could anyone help me with a partition problem pls?
[11:42] <boink> !ask
[11:42] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:42] <kitche> CruCiaL-X: just say your problem
[11:42] <oht> can anyone help me with some girl problems?
[11:43] <matiu> ubotu, help downgrade
[11:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about help downgrade - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:43] <oht> ;)
[11:43] <matiu> ubotu, help
[11:43] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl  -  Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[11:43] <matiu> ubotu, downgrade
[11:43] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[11:43] <boink> downgrading is silly
[11:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell matiu about bot
[11:43] <matiu> oh great
[11:43] <boink> don't do it
[11:43] <mattthebaker> yokanzo: most distros provide their own packaged versions of linux apps, typically precompiled binaries configured with options the developers see fit
[11:43] <matiu> I've already got a broken system
[11:43] <boink> time to fix it
[11:44] <K1765> Hey

[11:44] <matiu> I'll re-install dapper over the top, luckily I saved my home partition

[11:46] <Yokanzo> What does this mean?
[11:46] <kitche> CruCiaL-X: well see windows can't see ext3 drives without a third party driver so that's why it's not showing up in windows
[11:46] <bintara> anyone can help ?
[11:46] <bintara> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31321/
[11:46] <bintara> whats wrong with it ?

[11:51] <boink> then it's a dns problem
[11:51] <boink> check your /etc/resolv.conf
[11:51] <Yokanzo> i don't understand the manual entry for hwclock
[11:51] <Yokanzo> how do I set it to 5:51
[11:51] <meeuro1_> whats the command to set sudo permissions to a file so it will execute?
[11:51] <boink> man chmod
[11:52] <meeuro1_> so   "sudo chmod 777 path to file?

[11:52] <connie_lh> Hello y'all. I just got a new laptop with a widescreen and an nvidia 6100 graphics card. It all works except that my loading screen before gdm is all screwed up. Is there anything I can do?
[11:52] <boink> never use 777
[11:52] <motin_> boink: aha - it says nameserver 127.0.0.1
[11:52] <boink> well, change it to a valid name server
[11:52] <meeuro1_> whats proper to use to allow a rpm to execute
[11:52] <boink> !alien
[11:52] <ubotu> rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
