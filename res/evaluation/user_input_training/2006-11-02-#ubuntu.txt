[12:01] <sparr> interesting.  faster than dash?
[12:01] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: put your local installation at the front of your $PATH
[12:01] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: the launchers use relative, not absolute, paths
[12:01] <sethk> sparr, I think you type the fewest characters with zsh.  I haven't used dash much, though.  I assume it's the default because it's low overhead.
[12:02] <sethk> sparr, might be the dash from busybox, I'll have to check.
[12:02] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: ln -s /usr/bin/firefox /home/patrick/Packages/firefox/firefox
[12:02] <crimsun> Commander-Crow1: pastebin ``lspci -vn && amixer''
[12:02] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: erk :/ I think the easiest solution was just put into offtopic, symlink it to /usr/local/bin/firefox
[12:02] <soundray> Commander-Crow1: run 'lspci -vn && amixer' and post the output on the pastebin
[12:02] <ubuntu_newb> Hello everyone.
[12:02] <dibblego> the network-admin applet crashes each time I try to use it
[12:02] <sparr> sethk: err, i mean faster for running scripts.  thats why i use dash instead of bash for sh, it cuts minutes off some long scripts
[12:02] <Commander-Crow1> ok
[12:02] <Commander-Crow1> will do
[12:02] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: /usr/local/bin by default has priority over /usr/bin
[12:02] <sethk> sparr, right, just startup time would be a lot quicker
=== Commander-Crow1 is now known as Commander-Crowe
[12:03] <sparr> sethk: openoffice 'configure' script runs over a minute faster in dash than bash  :)
[12:03] <cynical> not that it would make a difference
[12:03] <sethk> sparr, interesting.
[12:03] <Homer_Linux> yeah ive thyed the gnome-panel and i get this error "ive detected a panel already running ,and will now exit"
[12:03] <SilentDis> hello :)
[12:04] <kikokos_> hello

[12:04] <squidly> hello anyone here using nagios?
[12:04] <soundray> Homer_Linux: is starting over with a new gnome configuration an option?
[12:04] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: how would I delete the existing firefox symlink in /usr/local/bin/firefox
[12:04] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: you don't need to
[12:04] <kikokos_> I added new user but I dont have userdirectory /home/....
[12:04] <SilentDis> !nagios
[12:04] <Paddy_EIRE> ok
[12:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nagios - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:04] <kikokos_> what`s up?
[12:04] <soundray> SilentDis: System-Preferences-Removable...
[12:05] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: it aint working
[12:05] <squidly> SilentDis: i have nagios installed but I messed up and over wrote a config file i need ><
[12:05] <kikokos_> I have my ol user directory/home/username/
[12:05] <SilentDis> squidly:  what is nagios?
[12:05] <mcphail> Paddy_EIRE: type "hash -r"
[12:05] <LjL> kikokos_: how did you add the user?
[12:05] <salim> hi, wine does hardly work, because I often get error message that he cant import dlls and outputs strange symbols: err:module:import_dll Library 
[12:05] <n1gke> kikokos_, just ask your question and perhaps someone will help you, now or later.
[12:05] <SilentDis> soundray: thanks :)
[12:05] <adele_> I have followed the guide to install ATI driver at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI but its not working. I have tried the troubleshooting thing but it doesn't work. Can somebody help me out?
[12:05] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: the link, or calling firefox?
[12:05] <kikokos_> adduser
[12:05] <squidly> nagios is a monitoring utility
[12:05] <Daviey> salim, you can normally find the dll's wine requires by searching google
[12:05] <Paddy_EIRE> joevandyk:  calling firefox
[12:06] <specialbuddy> is there a way to go from ubuntu to kubuntu without reinstalling
[12:06] <LjL> kikokos_: that's weird, it should definitely create a home unless you instruct it not to. tried again?
[12:06] <kikokos_> ljl I used adduser
[12:06] <LjL> specialbuddy: you can install kubuntu-desktop, that won't remove gnome though
[12:06] <soundray> specialbuddy: 'sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop'
[12:06] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: ls -l /usr/local/bin/firefox; echo $PATH
[12:06] <Paddy_EIRE> mcphail: what did that do
[12:06] <salim> the point is I cant search the dlls because I dont know what dlls he wants, he just outputs strange question marks: err:module:import_dll Library 
[12:06] <DanSchnell> I still can't get ubuntu to boot correctly from LiveCD.  Can I get some help?
[12:06] <specialbuddy> is there a way to get rid of ubuntu after that?
[12:06] <NemesisUK> anyone here use a dvb card?
[12:06] <kikokos_> yes I tried again with another user name Iand I dont have usercatalogs in /home

[12:06] <Daviey> NemesisUK, yes
[12:06] <LjL> specialbuddy: not really... you can remove libgnome, and it'll remove most of the stuff.
[12:06] <Commander-Crowe> pastebin isn't working is there something else?
[12:06] <kikokos_> I work in recovery mode on edgy
[12:06] <Homer_Linux> sondray sorry mate is late what do you mean
[12:07] <SilentDis> adele_: i have some bad news... i had the same problem, couldn't get acceleration working at all.  I ended up dropping in an NVidia card and not looking back.
[12:07] <mcphail> Paddy_EIRE: it told BASH to check your $PATH for firefox again, rather than remembering where it looked last time
[12:07] <LjL> Commander-Crowe: pastebin.ca
[12:07] <LjL> Commander-Crowe: it's working for me anyway
[12:07] <kikokos_> ljl it`s to me about remove libgni\ome..
[12:07] <kikokos_> ?
[12:07] <salim> is there a utf8/westerniso error maybe?
[12:07] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[12:07] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: my firefox link is not there
[12:07] <soundray> Homer_Linux: have you put a lot of work in your gnome configuration?
[12:07] <DanSchnell> Soundray, None of those work
[12:07] <jorgp> specialbuddy, yes, in /etc/apt/sources.list change ubuntu to kubuntu, apt-get update and your off apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[12:07] <NemesisUK> Daviey, how do I get sound from the card, I have video
[12:07] <DanSchnell> I think it may have something to do with having a custom built computetr
[12:07] <cntb> how do I see users in channel in xchat ubuntu ?
[12:07] <LjL> kikokos_: no, i said specialbuddy
[12:07] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: you need to make the link with sudo, ie 'ln -s *firefox path* /usr/local/bin/firefox
[12:07] <JosefK> '
[12:07] <Homer_Linux> soundray ;(  yes but never mind
[12:07] <JosefK> erk, sudo ln -s.
[12:07] <soundray> DanSchnell: describe your problem
[12:08] <kikokos_> LjL ok but have you any suggest :)?
[12:08] <LjL> kikokos_: try typing "ls -l / | grep home" and pasting the output
[12:08] <Daviey> NemesisUK, it just worked!  have you looked at alsamixer?
[12:08] <mandelum> Can I update from edgy RC1 to the final release, is there anything else to  do than to install all the automatic updates? or should I reinstall?
[12:08] <LjL> kikokos_, patience. i have only 10 fingers
[12:08] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: ahhh
[12:08] <salim> cntb: click on the users button on the left bottom, it is labeled with "1030 Users"

[12:08] <xenakis> if I want to put a script to execute regardless of runlevel, where should I put the symbolic link to it?
[12:08] <DanSchnell> soundray, when I select "start or install Ubuntu" it loads but then my screen gets all purple and doesn't show the desktop
[12:08] <SilentDis> soundray: i switched it to gaim, i assume I have to restart gnome after?
[12:08] <kikokos_> ljl jer=new user
[12:08] <soundray> Homer_Linux: exit gnome, log into a failsafe session and run 'rm ~/.gnome*'

[12:09] <kikokos_> ljl that`s good u have them

[12:09] <soundray> DanSchnell: have you tried the safe graphics option?

[12:09] <Commander-Crowe> http://pastebin.ca/233434
[12:09] <kikokos_> ljl adduser
[12:09] <Daviey> NemesisUK, presumably you have "dvb-utils dvbstream" installed?
[12:09] <zambatrue> quick link to edgy repos please?
[12:09] <LjL> kikokos_: without any parameters?
[12:09] <Commander-Crowe> soundray: http://pastebin.ca/233434
[12:09] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: does that 'ls -l /usr/local/bin/firefox; echo $PATH' work?
[12:09] <kikokos_> ljl yes without
[12:09] <soundray> SilentDis: no, you don't
[12:09] <mandelum> Can I update from edgy RC1 to the final release, is there anything else to  do than to install all the automatic updates? or should I reinstall?
[12:10] <Commander-Crowe> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/233434
[12:10] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: what is it supposed to do
[12:10] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: your $PATH should have /usr/local/bin closer to the start of the line than /usr/bin
[12:10] <LjL> kikokos_: ok, i'm not understanding why /home has group "jer". did you set this manually?
[12:10] <DanSchnell> Soundray, Yes, I can take a picture of it if you would like so you can see what I am experiencing
[12:10] <io_pcg> I would to know how to execute the program c++ that I installed with synaptic
[12:10] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: the 'ls -l' just shows you where the link points to, the echo shows us what's in your PATH variable (where programs are searched for)
[12:10] <kalikiana> anyone knowledge about dsl usb modems?
[12:10] <kitche> io_pcg: do you mean g++?
[12:10] <kikokos_> ljl o g maybe i was so sleepy yesterday
[12:11] <Daviey> io_pcg, do you mean c++ development enviroment or just the compiler?
[12:11] <kikokos_> but what should i do now?
[12:11] <io_pcg> umm not c++ is a language
[12:11] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: /usr/local/sbin
[12:11] <sethk> io_pcg, you mean the c++ compiler?
[12:11] <soundray> DanSchnell: I don't really think I can be of any help -- just wanted to check the obvious
[12:11] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: there should be /usr/local/bin there too
[12:11] <io_pcg> yes
[12:11] <kikokos_> ljl how to delete this group?
[12:11] <io_pcg> the compiler
[12:11] <SilentDis> soundray: duh of the day, changed the wrong thing rofl.
[12:11] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: yes its second
[12:11] <DanSchnell> Can anyone else help me?
[12:11] <sethk> io_pcg, usually it's /usr/bin/g++
[12:11] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: then if the link checks out, type 'firefox' into a console and see which you get
[12:11] <LjL> kikokos_: well, i'm not sure how the problem might have arisen, but i'd do:   "sudo chown root:root /home ; sudo deluser jer ; sudo adduser jer"
[12:11] <soundray> DanSchnell: you will have to describe your problem again.
[12:12] <SilentDis> soundray: works fine when I do it right, of course.  rofl.  thank you :)
[12:12] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: that looks like an onboard driven by snd-intel8x0, not your audigy ls
[12:12] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: command not found
[12:12] <n1gke> DanSchnell, just ask the question and someone will help you, now or later.....
[12:12] <Daviey> io_pcg, you should just be able to type 'g++' in the console
[12:12] <Commander-Crowe> crimsun: oops
[12:12] <DanSchnell> Soundray, I will take a picture, I will be back in a few moments
[12:12] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: are you sure the link points to the right place? check the 'ls -l' output carefully
[12:12] <Homer_Linux> soundray is a directory wont let me remove iit
[12:12] <io_pcg> for example: sudo g++?
[12:12] <NemesisUK> Daviey, just checked alsamixer the cards in there and the volumes are all set but I still get no sound
[12:12] <io_pcg> c++ sorry!
[12:12] <Agrajag> io_pcg: no, just g++
[12:12] <Commander-Crowe> crimsun: but I tried that one and it still didn't work
[12:12] <io_pcg> ok
[12:12] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: pastebin ``cat ~/.asoundrc*'', too
[12:12] <io_pcg> let me check hehe
[12:12] <Daviey> NemesisUK, presumably you have "dvb-utils dvbstream" installed?
[12:13] <Agrajag> io_pcg: don't use sudo unless you need root privileges
[12:13] <NemesisUK> Daviey, yes
[12:13] <sethk> io_pcg, there should also be a link c++, so you can use either
[12:13] <LjL> io_pcg: C++ is a language, g++ (part of the GCC project) is a compiler that compiles C++
[12:13] <soundray> Homer_Linux: sorry, it has to be 'rm -rf .gnome*'. Don't do it while gnome is running, otherwise it'll write the old data back.
[12:13] <Commander-Crowe> it says no such dur
[12:13] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: it just says "File exists" each time I try to symlink it to anywhere
[12:13] <Commander-Crowe> dir*
[12:13] <SilentDis> thanks again, rather glad I switched to ubuntu, never have I found a linux community so helpful.
[12:13] <kikokos_> ljl,Cannot remove group jer which is a primary group for another user
[12:13] <sethk> Paddy_EIRE, that means the _link_ exists already
[12:13] <Commander-Crowe> crimsun: no such dir
[12:13] <SilentDis> take care all :)
[12:13] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: you're getting the symlink the correct way round?  ln [source]  [destination] 
[12:13] <Daviey> NemesisUK, what are you using to watch tv?
[12:13] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: ok, now pastebin ``cat /var/log/dmesg /proc/interrupts''

[12:15] <mandelum> Can I update from edgy RC1 to the final release, is there anything else to  do than to install all the automatic updates? or should I reinstall?
[12:15] <Arrick> LjL, I was asking because the live cd works, but the default install doesnt, any tricks forit?
[12:15] <LjL> mandelum: automatic updates should be fine
[12:15] <Daviey> NemesisUK, hmm - i only tested mine on mplayer.  not that it should matter, but worth a try
[12:15] <kikokos_> ljl userdel: Cannot remove group jer which is a primary group for another user.
[12:15] <kikokos_> done.

[12:16] <eugman> Can someone help me with my evolution problem?
[12:16] <NemesisUK> Daviey, I'll go install that brb
[12:16] <soundray> eugman: what are you trying to evolve into?
[12:16] <LjL> Arrick: i don't know. perhaps try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" from a console, if you can get to it (otherwise use recovery mode), and tinker. select VESA driver if nothing else works.

[12:17] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: will all the other users at my comp beable to benefit from this or should I have put the extracted firefox directory somewhere else other than "/home/myname/Packages/firefox" ??
[12:17] <eugman> Soundray, a linux user. Unfortunately that seems to require a massive amount of energy. Or someone who can get the mail program set right.
[12:18] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: you can use chmod and friends so they can, but yes, installing as root to /opt or /usr/local would be preferable
[12:18] <kikokos_> ljl  i dont want to log as another user cause it has bad gonfiguration gnome
[12:18] <soundray> eugman: your best bet is to describe your problem and hope for an evolution expert to be listening.
[12:18] <kalikiana> anyone knowledge about dsl usb modems?
[12:18] <LjL> kikokos_, i said as your *own* user. type "groups" and see if you are a member of "jer"
[12:18] <soundray> kalikiana: is this a survey?
[12:19] <Arrick> thanks
[12:19] <sethk> kalikiana, slightly.  ask your question, see if someone might know the answer
[12:19] <io_pcg> if I writte g++ in the console they say that there aren't packets in the enter, what I have to do?
[12:19] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: what If I chmod the entire Packages folder then they would beable to use it wouldnt they
[12:19] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: ie, cd to the base of your firefox installation, and run 'chmod -R 755 .'
[12:19] <LjL> io_pcg, i'm sorry, but i can't understand your english
[12:19] <kalikiana> soundray: i just seek for help getting my usb modem to work :(
[12:19] <sethk> io_pcg, it will say "no input files", is that what you mean?
[12:19] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: indeed
[12:19] <soundray> io_pcg: your question doesn't make sense
[12:19] <eugman> soundray, Well my problem is more ubuntu related. A change in the UI seems to have made specifying a program with an argument impossible.
[12:20] <sethk> io_pcg, you give it a file name.  it's a compiler, you have to tell it what file to compile.
[12:20] <soundray> kalikiana: describe the problem
[12:20] <kikokos_> ljl root@jo-desktop:~# groups
[12:20] <kikokos_> root
[12:20] <kikokos_> root@jo-desktop:~#
[12:20] <io_pcg> sethk yes sorry ^_^''''
[12:20] <LjL> kikokos_, *NOT* as root, as your *OWN* user
[12:20] <io_pcg> ammm ok, and the compiler?
[12:20] <soundray> eugman: be *even more* specific
[12:20] <nothlit> Hi, I've install gtk-engines-pixmap and restarted x but still get this message Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
[12:20] <Paddy_EIRE> JosefK: what do I type "sudo chmod -R 755 /home/patrick/Packages" ???
[12:20] <kalikiana> soundray: i have 'castlenet' dsl modem connected via usb and i don't know how to install it
[12:20] <io_pcg> sorry, the program to do a program...
[12:21] <io_pcg> how I have to execute?
[12:21] <kikokos_> ljl i`m in recovery cause my own user has bad cofiguration gnome
[12:21] <mcphail> Paddy_EIRE: the problem with that solution is that your users are going to get firefox2 when they may be expecting/wanting/needing 1.5
[12:21] <io_pcg> hahahaah
[12:21] <Daviey> io_pcg, Have you thought about using a development enviroment like kdevelop?  Then you can use menu's to compile
[12:21] <Twiggy> Hey I'm on a fresh edgy install and for whatever reason my right alt/ctrl keys don't work, but the left ones do.  This worked before on an dapper -> edgy upgraded install.  Any ideas what could be up?
[12:21] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: yes, although check what permissions it has already
[12:21] <nirvdrum> Yo.
[12:21] <Paddy_EIRE> mcphail: that does not matter
[12:21] <JosefK> Paddy_EIRE: and as mcphail said, that could be a problem
[12:21] <mcphail> ok
[12:21] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed ubuntu on my second pc
[12:21] <voraistos> !ati
[12:21] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[12:21] <soundray> kalikiana: does the modem show up when you enter 'lsusb'?
[12:21] <ubuntu_newb> what would be a good list of packages to install for the basic stuff
[12:21] <LjL> kikokos_: i'm afraid it's not just your gnome config that is bad. anyway, type "groups your-username"
[12:22] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed all the updates.
[12:22] <io_pcg> yes I have already install, but...it don't apear in my first menu...and I don't know how to execute...:S
[12:22] <LjL> kikokos_: and please paste only the output line, don't spam the channel
[12:22] <kalikiana> soundray: in fact since i plugged it in, lsusb doesn't respond any more
[12:22] <crimsun> Commander-Crowe: there don't appear to be any interrupts processed for the ca0106

[12:29] <nothlit> Hi, can someone tell me why I get Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap", after I've installed gtk-engines-pixmap and restarted X ?
[12:30] <LjL> kikokos_, you have created a user whose name is "groupname". i'm not sure what you've been doing, but it wasn't too good.
[12:30] <sethk> SamuelDr, run it under strace, the grep for open in the output.  you'll see what files it uses
[12:30] <LjL> kikokos_, try "deluser groupname"
[12:31] <kikokos_> ljl ok it`s done
[12:31] <SamuelDr> thanks sethk !
[12:31] <LjL> kikokos_: now try again "deluser jer"
[12:31] <jvai> samueldr: maybe in "search for files" in the places part of the panel.. make a search thru the filesystem
[12:31] <kikokos_> ljl jer also doesn`t exist now
[12:32] <LjL> kikokos_: type "delgroup jer"
[12:32] <chad> heyas guys
[12:32] <kikokos_> ljl ok removed
[12:32] <SamuelDr> jvai, I already searched through my system for "*nm*" and "*network*" | grep manager
[12:33] <jvai> oo sorry
[12:33] <cabal_> bye
[12:33] <_spanner_> If I have a process that's holding on to a file handle, but the file has been deleted on the filesystem... is there any way to get that file back? I had expected the ln command to maybe take an inode number or something like that.
[12:33] <LjL> kikokos_: type "chown root:root /home ; chown -R jo:jo /home/jo"  (assuming your username is jo, if i got it correctly)
[12:34] <SamuelDr> well, gprep-ping the strace for open didn't really work... I get an awfully long list of anything... not even related to open
[12:34] <craz4eva> hi guys.... I've just installed some updates just now and gnome-terminal now refused to start
[12:34] <kikokos_> ljl i think it`s done

[12:34] <sveur> anyone know how i kan grant non-roots access to a drive?
[12:34] <craz4eva> anyone having the same problem?
[12:34] <LjL> kikokos_: now type "adduser jer"
[12:34] <SamuelDr> I get the exact same thing as if I only strace
[12:34] <kitche> sveur: use umask
[12:34] <Homer_Linux> soundray didnt work ;( still have no panels
[12:34] <sveur> where?
[12:35] <kikokos_> ljl Creating home directory `/home/jer  :):)
[12:35] <sveur> kitche: how?
[12:35] <SamuelDr> anyway, brb
[12:35] <_spanner_> LjL: thanks, but what can I do with that? It seems it should be possible in theory to make a new file with that inode, and yet I can't find any way to do it...
[12:35] <LjL> kikokos_: ok, now the user should be there, and *perhaps* your own "jo" user will work again (just perhaps, the second chown command i've given you might have done the trick). try rebooting into multiuser mode
[12:35] <deema> how come Ubuntu doesn't show the icon of a file, such an .exe, it only shows the default Ubuntu icon for that file TYPE?
[12:35] <kitche> sveyr: man umask I m not a user of umask so I can't really tell you how to use it

[12:36] <relbs> I'm trying to compile a kernel module with make-kpkg, so I unpacked it to /usr/src/modules, did a make-kpkg clean ; make-kpkg debian modules_image, but I get an error message 'The UTS Release version in include/linux/version.h \ "" \ does not match current version: \ "2.6.17.13-ubuntu1'
[12:36] <relbs> what option do i need to tweak?
[12:36] <sethk> deema, if it knows the MIME type, it connects it with an icon.  Names, in non-toy operating systems, are irrelevant.  the name doesn't say anything about the type
[12:36] <chad> i have a logitech usb headset(earphones) i can choose and enable it in alsa mixer.. volume is up and all.. but i get no sound or errors
[12:36] <kikokos_> ljl ok but what should i write as full name after psswrd?
[12:36] <sveur> kitche: no man entry for umask
[12:36] <soundray> Homer_Linux: you may need to 'rm -rf ~/.gconf*' as well
[12:36] <crimsun> chad: is the usb headset selected as the default audio output device?
[12:36] <sveur> kitche: could you try to explain the basics?
[12:36] <kikokos_> ljl whatever? or sth special
[12:37] <LjL> kikokos_: the full name of the user. the system doesn't care.
[12:37] <chad> in the alsa mixer yes
[12:37] <crimsun> chad: is it specified in ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf, too?
[12:37] <v3l0ct> sveur, http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/umask.1.asp
[12:37] <hangfire> deema- and executables often arent executable outside of the homefolder
[12:37] <deema> sethk, can you explain that in different words? I didn't quite understand
[12:37] <sethk> chad, make sure pcm is not all the way down, both input and output
[12:38] <_spanner_> deema: it is possible... for example you can get a preview of a jpeg or a pdf file in the icon. There's no reason that the image embedded in a .exe file couldn't be used. I imagine the reason is that most Linux guys don't have a significant amount of Win32 PE files lying around.
[12:38] <kitche> sveur: it's allows non-root users to write to a disk
[12:38] <sethk> deema, the icon, most of the time, will be chosen according to the file's type.  The  file _name_ doesn't say anything about the type.
[12:38] <chad> hmm.. where do i find those asound files? im a little newbie still:p
[12:38] <kikokos_> ljl ok so i reboot now and tell u after how it was:)
[12:38] <crimsun> chad: ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf
[12:38] <sethk> deema, in windows, typically, a file named .exe is executable, and .bat is a script.  UNIX doesn't have those restrictions
[12:38] <deema> okay what _spanner said
[12:38] <sethk> deeem, and files don't even need to have an extension, although they can.
[12:39] <deema> that's what I mean
[12:39] <deema> the icon imbedded in an exe
[12:39] <jvai> saueldr
[12:39] <deema> why doesn't it show THAT icon
[12:39] <jvai> samueldr
[12:39] <sethk> deema, a windows exe?  completely different format
[12:39] <chad> is that in / (root) or where?

[12:39] <DanSchnell> I am back, and this time I have pictures of my problem.  Soundray, are you here?
[12:39] <sethk> deema, why would it show?  it's for a different o/s.
[12:39] <jvai> he bounced?
[12:39] <jvai> ok
[12:40] <_spanner_> deema: No-one wrote the code to do it. It's probably not too hard, but I'd guess not enough demand for it
[12:40] <soundray> DanSchnell: for a short while, yes
[12:40] <deema> okay. so what you're saying is that embedded icon is in .exe don't show in Linux. is there a way to display them?
[12:40] <dredhammer> so if i downgrade from edgy to dapper do i lose my home directory if its a seperate partition?
[12:40] <deema> okay, that makes sense then. Iwas wondering if there was a way to do it

[12:40] <v3l0ct> dreadhammer, no

[12:40] <DanSchnell> Soundray: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v512/tathar902/other%20stuff/screenshots/100_0151.jpg
[12:41] <dredhammer> so i just pop the dvd in and tell it to install dapper?
[12:41] <v3l0ct> dredhammer, just install but don't format your home partition
[12:41] <dredhammer> ok thanks
[12:41] <soundray> DanSchnell: have you tried any of the vga= options?
[12:41] <v3l0ct> np
[12:41] <DanSchnell> Soundray, yes
[12:42] <sethk> deema, there are programs around to extract the icon, wouldn't be too hard to set up.  the correct question, though, is, since X windows had been around for well over 15 years before windows existed, why didn't microsoft put the icon in the correct place?
[12:42] <DanSchnell> Soundray, do you think its possible that the liveCD doesn't like my nVidia 6800 GS running in SLI

[12:43] <matjan> hi, is there a linux app that can read chm-files (you know, those windoze help files)?
[12:43] <_spanner_> LjL: I saw debugfs... it relies on the FS being unmounted though... I'd have to kill the process that has the file open in order to umount it. Could work, but it seems unnecessarily risky

[12:53] <LjL> kikokos: type Ctrl+Alt+F2 - when you're finished, type Ctrl+Alt+F7 to come back here
[12:53] <kikokos> ljl i don`t want to do anything wrong now
[12:53] <mepaYancho> soundray im reading .. but im finding them hard to understand sorry :|
[12:53] <crimsun> NET||abuse: pastebin (see topic) ``cat ~/.asoundrc* && asoundconf list''
[12:53] <mcphail> obo: just ask your question. If anyone knows, they will reply :)
[12:53] <obo> I'm using the .vimrc file located at http://www.vi-improved.org/wiki/index.php/VimGpg to transparently edit GPG-encrypted files inside vim. This has workd on Fedora before, but won't work in Ubuntu. Kind of dissapointing.
[12:53] <Rappermas> LjL: thanks for the howto
[12:53] <LjL> kikokos: actually, scrap that. just type "su - jo", it'll be easier
[12:53] <soundray> mepaYancho: ask about what you don't understand then. That way, you won't sound dumb.
[12:54] <mepaYancho> first of all - what is dapper? i mean is edge dapper ?
[12:54] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell mepaYancho about dapper
[12:54] <XtremeBain> dapper is 6.06, edgy is 6.10
[12:54] <apokryphos> mepaYancho: have you checked the FAQ first?
[12:54] <obo> E121: Undefined variable: ch_save
[12:54] <obo> E15: Invalid expression: ch_save|unlet ch_save
[12:55] <kalikiana> soundray: was it you who gave me tips about my usb modem?
[12:55] <soundray> kalikiana: yes
[12:55] <relbs> has anyone been able to succesfully compile openafs-modules-source in edgy?
[12:55] <ubuntu_newb> is there any packages for running apache web server and all that on Ubuntu?
[12:55] <xerophyte> does any good GUI programming evn for gnome ??
[12:55] <mepaYancho> 10x ... yes apokryphos im following a tutorial on edge :|
[12:55] <ubuntu_newb> or does that have to be installed manually?
[12:56] <soundray> !apache | ubuntu_newb
[12:56] <ubotu> ubuntu_newb: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[12:56] <apokryphos> mepaYancho: not the same though; the FAQ answers a lot of basic questions. It's quite good :)
[12:56] <apokryphos> !faq | mepaYancho
[12:56] <ubotu> mepaYancho: faq is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions Official documentation is at http://help.ubuntu.com IRC FAQ: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRCResourcePage
[12:56] <kalikiana> soundray: i rebooted several times with no change, i plugged out and in , removed the power... lsusb won't react when the modem is plugged in
[12:56] <ubuntu_newb> ok thank you
[12:56] <soundray> kalikiana: is it possibly kaputt?
[12:56] <azureal> my sound seems beyond repair....how would i go about reinstalling 2.6.17-10 kernel?
[12:57] <azureal> ciao.
[12:57] <kalikiana> soundray: i don't think so because i used it before on a windows laptop
[12:57] <soundray> kalikiana: are you plugging it into a hub or direct into the mainboard?
[12:58] <brasileiro> I'm having problems with my cd recorder, I can't even mount them
[12:58] <kalikiana> soundray: i used one of the backsided usb ports
[12:58] <brasileiro> cdrecorder -scanbus returns nothing
[12:58] <pianoboy3333> What's the text command for lock version in synaptic?
[12:58] <ulrik> hey all wondering now in edgy. Previously I had some tool that managed my disks and their mountpoints (somewhere among admin tools). What's it called and how do I install it again?
[12:59] <kalikiana> soundray: and the ports should usually work fine as well
[12:59] <rag> hello*

[12:59] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[01:00] <toby> does anyone know how to install it in Edgy
[01:00] <soundray> kalikiana: I don't know what to suggest - except buying a decent modem that connects through Ethernet instead of USB.
[01:00] <rag> hello friends ! how to activate dri on ati card, ati rv350
[01:00] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell toby about xgl
[01:00] <toby> :)
[01:00] <kalikiana> soundray: is there any command to see why lsusb is frozen? i can't even cancel it
[01:01] <ulrik> is it pysdm??
[01:01] <azureal> MetaMorfoziS, would it be a bad idea to...idk...reinstall the current kernel while working it?
[01:01] <kikokos> ljl after adding all things jer restart gnome? m i right?
[01:01] <toby> its late so i come back tomorrow
[01:01] <toby> bye
[01:01] <funshineBear> guys, help me. i upgraded my xubuntu via command line but i can't get on to my computer anmyore. please help
[01:01] <cpk1> how do you get the change log of apps with apt?
[01:01] <LjL> kikokos: yes, log out and back in
[01:01] <MetaMorfoziS> azureal > i want to build a new one
[01:01] <Legendre> Well, fwiw, Edgy works farking sweet on my IBM Thinkpad 31
[01:01] <LjL> !apt-changelog | cpk1
[01:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about apt-changelog - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:01] <soundray> kalikiana: like I say, it indicates a hardware problem. You could run 'strace lsusb' to see where exactly it hangs.
[01:02] <LjL> whops
[01:02] <LjL> !apt-listchanges | cpk1
[01:02] <azureal> ?
[01:02] <ubotu> apt-listchanges: Display change history from .deb archives. In component main, is optional. Version 2.59-0.3ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 48 kB, installed size 328 kB
[01:02] <cpk1> LjL: thanks =)
[01:02] <Legendre> I have a Q about wifi.. Edgy says my wireless connection is not configured, but as it happens, it's working perfectly. What's up with that?
[01:03] <sethk> Legendre, you mean you are using it from within linux?
[01:03] <sethk> Legendre, it doesn't mean anything about the hardware, it means the o/s has (hasn't in this case) found it and set it up
[01:03] <Legendre> sethk - yeah, it's working swell.. but Edgy says it's not configured or enabled
[01:03] <kikokos> ljl ok i`ve got sounds in gnome
[01:03] <kikokos> ljl thank`s again
[01:03] <kitche> Legendre: yeah I notice a bug with the network-manager with that
[01:03] <sethk> Legendre, that would be a first.  ifconfig   (no arguments)  shows no interfaces, or only lo?
[01:03] <Legendre> sethk - but it's working fine. that's the odd part..
[01:04] <LjL> kikokos: you're welcome. perhaps try to tinker less with things you shouldn't be tinkering with, next time ;-P
[01:04] <kikokos> ljl should i add sth more jer?
[01:04] <jprieur> Hi, I upgraded from Dapper to Edgy, and after fixed dsl modem and X issues, there's still one : between GRUB and GDM, my screen displays (hardware) me a "Video mode not supported" message. I guess it comes from GRUB not using a good resolution but I don't know more, how can I fix that?
[01:04] <sethk> Legendre, try ifconfig, maybe the gui is messed up
[01:04] <LjL> kikokos, no, i don't think
[01:04] <Legendre> sethk - no, ifconfig shows a whole host of interfaces.
[01:04] <kalikiana> soundray: so at least now i get an output, but i think 'permission denied' and 'operation not permitted' won'T help too much anyway
[01:04] <Legendre> just the gui is totally unaware of it
[01:04] <kikokos> ljl ok thank u so much
[01:04] <sethk> Legendre, everything show by ifconfig (without the -a flag) is set up, so it has to be the gui.
[01:05] <soundray> kalikiana: that's unusual. Should go away if you use sudo, though
[01:05] <Legendre> sethk - if it were windows, the situation would be reversed.. which is pretty funny.
[01:06] <jprieur> Nobody to help me? :)
[01:06] <soundray> jprieur: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, find a line beginning with #kopt, add 'vga=771', save the file, run 'sudo update-grub' and try again
[01:06] <azureal> MetaMorfoziS, i dont understand what you're suggesting...some of your links had kind of 'infinite loops'.... would aptitude reinstall linux-server work for me in console..?
[01:07] <jprieur> soundray: thx
[01:07] <LjL> soundray: will the vga option work with usplash?
[01:07] <kalikiana> soundray: wow, you're great - although now it freezes with a usbdev_connectinfo
[01:07] <soundray> LjL: I think so
[01:07] <ltr^^^> join #amarok
[01:07] <soundray> kalikiana: thanks. Dodgy hardware...
[01:08] <SamuelDr> argh
[01:08] <azureal> why is there so much love for ...amarok...
[01:08] <crimsun> azureal: because it's a nice app?
[01:08] <kalikiana> soundray: i guess i did already annoy you enough with this problem of mine; i do appreciate your effort and now i damn whoever made such a thing
[01:08] <jprieur> thank for the help, then I hope I'll don't have to get back there :)
[01:08] <azureal> nope =P
[01:08] <SamuelDr> I found out that nm-applet tries to read some files in /etc/NetworkManager ... but there is no configuration file...
[01:09] <DanSchnell> I am having some display problems on the liveCD, Can anyone help?  Screenshots can be found here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290877
[01:09] <soundray> kalikiana: not to worry, glad I could be of some use.
[01:09] <eegore> Is there a channel for linux gaminmg?
[01:10] <LjL> DanSchnell: tried booting with the safe graphics mode option?
[01:10] <soundray> kalikiana: USB DSL modems tend to be problematic with Linux in general -- it's the manufacturers' fault.
[01:10] <LjL> !games | eegore, don't know, but
[01:10] <ubotu> eegore, don't know, but: Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[01:10] <earlGrey> Installed Ubuntu edgy - everything works great except for Flash in Opera; Flash works amazingly well in Firefox (I installed from automatix2). Any ideas?
[01:10] <azureal> crimsun, quick question--i somehow messed up sound ability in my server edition kernel... if i booted into a different kernel should i run 'aptitude reinstall' or 'aptitude remove' then 'aptitude install linux-server' ?
[01:11] <soundray> kalikiana: Ethernet works much better.
[01:11] <crimsun> azureal: what are you referring to with "sound ability?"
[01:11] <Chippy> hey, my keyboard has some special keys, one of which has a symbol associated with it, but 3 others do not; is there a .conf or the like I could edit to associate a symbol with these special keys?
[01:11] <DanSchnell> LjL, yup.  I've tried almost everything.  like changing driver to vesa instead of nv and vga=0x31A
[01:11] <SonicvanaJr> galador, sucks
[01:11] <LjL> !automatix | earlGrey
[01:11] <ubotu> earlGrey: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:11] <azureal> crimsun, sound does not work anymore....but dont worry about that... i just want to reinstall current kernel with brand new config
[01:12] <earlGrey> thanks, ubotu.
[01:13] <kalikiana> soundray: yeah, i had never any problems with ethernet in linux. so maybe i must invest some money now.
[01:13] <crimsun> azureal: apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-2.6.17-10-server
[01:13] <sethk> DanSchnell, you are hitting it with a vertical freq it can't handle.
[01:13] <calvarez> question: about how many packages are in the repositories?
[01:13] <xSUSHi> Anyone know how I can remap my keys?  I need < to be F8 and > to be Spacebar.
[01:13] <Chippy> hey, my keyboard has some special keys, one of which has a symbol associated with it, but 3 others do not; is there a .conf or the like I could edit to associate a symbol with these special keys?
[01:13] <sethk> DanSchnell, do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:13] <LjL> !packages | calvarez
[01:13] <ubotu> calvarez: You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 18000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[01:13] <lando> i need to install realplayer and the installation dialog asks me where i would like to install it to. what would be a good location
[01:13] <sethk> DanSchnell, choose the "middle" difficult level when you get to the monitor section
[01:13] <LjL> though i guess i'll update that, edgy has more ;)
[01:13] <PapaLion> is there an automatix for edgy yet?
[01:13] <azureal> crimsun, i prefer aptitude...why not just "aptitude reinstall linux-image...."
[01:13] <sethk> DanSchnell, then make sure the highest resolution is one the monitor can display
[01:13] <DanSchnell> sethk, Ok.
[01:13] <eegore> ubotu: the issue is network lag
[01:13] <LjL> !automatix | PapaLion

[01:14] <eegore> yep
[01:14] <azureal> bbl to try it out
[01:14] <calvarez> can someone tell me how many packages are in the repos?

[01:15] <mikeymike-linux> ok so....  some program in X usually asks me 'ignore/import' when i plug my digital camera in.. and i select ignore and voila my camera mounts and shows up on my desktop..... well its not doing that.... i hit ignore and nothing occurs and the camera contineus to attempt to connect to the computer..... if i hit IMPORT they open into whatever application it is that does that and i can see all my photos...... what gives? something t
[01:15] <mikeymike-linux> o do with mount? usb? earlier today i plugged a thumbdrive into my computer and it mounted and went to the desktop.... it mounted in /media anyone know whats up?
=== RogerBacon is now known as RogerBaconAW
[01:15] <sethk> DanSchnell, for that, put your X log on the paste site (usually /var/log/Xorg.log.0)
[01:16] <Rappermas> ok, this all good, but it doesn't tell me how to set a higher refresh rate on my monitor
[01:16] <jprieur> sorry but I didn't find anything biginning by #kopt in my menu.lst
[01:16] <sethk> mikeymike-linux, the desktop is just a display.  it was always mounted in /media
[01:16] <mikeymike-linux> i know the desktop is just a display im not dumb
[01:16] <soundray> kalikiana: ask a concrete question, like "When I connect my Castlenet USB DSL modem, lsusb freezes at usbdev_connectinfo (with strace). Any suggestions?"
[01:16] <sethk> mikeymike-linux, well, sorry, I was just trying to help.  you seemed to be saying that earlier is was automounted somewhere other than /media, which is not true.
[01:17] <mikeymike-linux> ah no its always /media im sure
[01:17] <karl> hi, I just dist-upgraded from dapper to edgy, it all looked good, nice new fonts, everything still worked, then I rebooted.  Now my x server is broken, as well as my wireless.  apt-get dist-upgrade again just says that a bunc of packages have been "held back" included xserver-xorg-core. any ideas?
[01:17] <clearzen> Does anyone know how I could control the screen brightness on my laptop when it is unplugged?
[01:17] <v3l0ct> karl, manually install xserver-xorg
[01:17] <kalikiana> soundray: you're right, i'll do that :)
[01:17] <LjL> karl: do you have any third-party repositories enabled? do you have the ubuntu-desktop package installed?
[01:18] <mikeymike-linux> sethk, sorry :] 
[01:18] <kalikiana> "When I connect my Castlenet USB DSL modem, lsusb freezes at usbdev_connectinfo (with strace). Any suggestions?
[01:18] <karl> v3l0ct: pardon?
[01:18] <mikeymike-linux> i guess im going to have to restart  lol.....
[01:18] <mikeymike-linux> or use google.
[01:18] <Chippy> hey, my keyboard has some special keys, one of which has a symbol associated with it, but 3 others do not; is there a .conf or the like I could edit to associate a symbol with these special keys?
[01:18] <karl> LjL: nope, just a dapper config with s/dapper/edgy/g
[01:19] <LjL> karl: i'd make sure you have ubuntu-desktop installed. "apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop", otherwise install it
[01:19] <clearzen> Does acpi control my screen brightness on my laptop?
[01:19] <jordan> Does anyone know the contact info for an admin @ ubuntu.com? I want to report a broken / missing link. Or should I use launchpad?
[01:19] <tapas> hmm, i have problems using open gl via dri on my thinkpad t21
[01:19] <kitche> jordan: think launchpad has a section for webiste
[01:19] <tapas> like freezing X :(
[01:20] <jordan> kitche: Thanks, I should have checked first :)
[01:20] <bimberi> jordan: i think you report bugs on the 'ubuntu-website' product
[01:20] <karl> v3l0ct: oh, gotcha, apt-get install xserver-xorg-core works by itself.
[01:20] <v3l0ct> karl, :)
[01:21] <v3l0ct> karl, also follow LJL's suggestion
[01:21] <mikeymike-linux> this would be an automount issue im having?
[01:21] <mikeymike-linux> does anyone know?
[01:21] <ubuntu_> dae raa
[01:22] <ubuntu_> blz?
[01:22] <jprieur> Ok, I still get a 'Not supported video mode' message on screen between GRUB and GDM even when adding vga=771 and sudo update-grub, any other clue?
[01:23] <sethk> jprieur, use vga=ask.  you'll get a menu of supported resolutions at boot time
[01:23] <sethk> jprieur, or just use the default 80x25 mode
[01:23] <ubuntu_newb> if I want to install LAMP on Ubuntu, is there a package to install the whole thing?
[01:24] <apokryphos> !lamp
[01:24] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[01:24] <LjL> sethk, jprieur, soundray: perhaps /etc/usplash.conf as well? or will that just decide the size of the picture, and not the actual resolution used?
[01:24] <jprieur> ok sethk : does it really matters it to be written after # kopt=... in the config file?
[01:24] <kitche> jprieur: is the screen blue by chance?
[01:24] <sethk> jprieur, shoudn't, no, the # is just a comment line
[01:24] <AlReece45> I'm trying to run Half Life, I have it installed, and when I run it in OpenGL mode, either I get no sound and good fps, or laggy sound and low fps. I've narrowed down the laggy sound and low fps to esd.
[01:24] <sethk> s/shoudn't/shouldn't/
[01:24] <jprieur> sethk: ok, that was I was thinking
[01:24] <soundray> jprieur: if you put it anywhere else, it'll be overridden when you next update the kernel
[01:25] <sethk> jprieur, soundray has a good point
[01:25] <jprieur> kitche: no, I get a 'Not supported video mode' displayed by my screen (hardware)
[01:25] <soundray> sethk, jprieur, the #kopt line has a special role in menu.lst and is not just a comment.
[01:25] <kitche> jprieur: ah one of those errors that the monitor shows
[01:25] <jprieur> kitche: yes
[01:26] <jprieur> soundray: ok, nice to know
[01:26] <sethk> soundray, I hadn't seen that in the grub docs.  is that new?
[01:26] <jprieur> soundray: so I pu it just after # kopt... ?
[01:26] <soundray> jprieur, sethk: when you run update-grub, it appends everything in the #kopt line to every kernel line within the automagic list.
[01:26] <deema> how do I run an .run file from the terminal?
[01:27] <kitche> deema: ./<file>.run but make sure it's chmod +x
[01:27] <deema> how do I do that?
[01:27] <deema> oh
[01:27] <sethk> soundray, oh, that's why I didn't see it.  I don't use grub-install, I install grub with the utility.
[01:27] <jprieur> soundray: so where do I add the 'vga=771'?
[01:27] <obo> any vim Gurus in here?
[01:27] <deema> do I just type in the file?
[01:27] <deema> it said command not found
[01:28] <mikeymike-linux> ok so lsusb is showing the camera.......
[01:28] <mikeymike-linux> Bus 002 Device 012: ID 03f0:8102 Hewlett-Packard
[01:28] <LjL> jordan: you'd want to try https://launchpad.net/products/ubuntu-website/+bugs - make sure it's not already reported
[01:28] <mikeymike-linux> how do i mount it......
[01:28] <kitche> deema: replace <file> with the filename of the file your trying to run don't forget the sh or the ./ infront
[01:28] <soundray> jprieur: to the end of the line that begins with #kopt (unless it already contains something like vga=5, in which case you change that)
[01:28] <bun-bun> !less

[01:28] <sethk> soundray, that's a different program than grub-install
[01:28] <bun-bun> what are the benefits of using less vs more?
[01:28] <jprieur> ok, I try that, thanks guys
[01:29] <xSUSHi>    UBUNTU KICKS ASS
[01:29] <sethk> jprieur, you don't need to reinstall.  just edit the file, and replace the current vga= with vga=ask
[01:29] <soundray> sethk: did I talk about grub-install? If I did, I meant update-grub

[01:29] <mepaYancho> Running game servers is it advised that i create a user for them .. lets say a user games ?
[01:29] <kitche> bun-bun: they do the same thing really
[01:29] <LjL> jordan: possibly already reported as https://launchpad.net/products/ubuntu-website/+bug/68492
[01:29] <bun-bun> kitche# i know they do, just wondering what benefits one offers over the other
[01:29] <sethk> bun-bun, less has more features than more,
[01:29] <kitche>  mepaYancho: well it's a good practice really
[01:30] <sethk> bun-bun, but they are similar, more or less  :)
[01:30] <mikeymike-linux> ok so lsusb is showing the camera....... Bus 002 Device 012: ID 03f0:8102 Hewlett-Packard... how do i mount it......
[01:30] <bun-bun> sethk# is one more secure than the other?
[01:30] <sethk> or if you prefer, less has fewer features than more
[01:30] <sethk> bun-bun, secure?  neither has any particular security implications.
[01:30] <kitche> bun-bun: they interact with the server they aren't like a daemon
[01:30] <jordan> LjL: Yup, that's it :)
[01:31] <LjL> jordan: hold on a second... have you clicked on "Other installation options" in the page? =)
[01:31] <jordan> LjL: No, let me try.
[01:31] <mepaYancho> is there some good tutorial on how to add users pls? :)
[01:31] <kitche> bun-bun: I mean user not server
[01:31] <deema> kitche
[01:31] <xSUSHi> ubuntu definately kicks ass  and so do all of you who help make the community!
[01:31] <bun-bun> i recall seeing something somewhere implying that less was more secure than more
[01:31] <LjL> jordan: i mean - choose a continent, choose a nation, choose a mirror, and "Other installation options"
[01:31] <bun-bun> but i don't remember the details
[01:31] <kitche> mepaYancho: sudo adduser it will run interactively
[01:31] <deema> kitche, it says ./ is a directory
[01:31] <qc> has ubuntu made anything work with 64-bit processors, and flash/window media websites???? or can you still not stream with it?
[01:31] <mepaYancho> thanks kitche
[01:31] <LjL> jordan: though that's possibly not the best way to advertize the torrent
[01:31] <sethk> bun-bun, no.  if you have an ssh connections, then it doesn't matter. if you don't have an ssh connection, than less is the least of your problems  :)
[01:32] <kitche> deema: are do you have ./ right next to your filename that your running?
[01:32] <deema> got it
[01:32] <deema> thank you
[01:32] <bun-bun> sethk# so you're implying that over an unencrypted connection there is an impact?
[01:32] <jordan> LjL: I actually liked the previous site better ( the one now considered other install options )
[01:32] <sethk> bun-bun, no, just that over an unencrypted connection security is hopeless.

[01:33] <LjL> jordan: *shrug* the bug is reported, anyway
[01:33] <sethk> bun-bun, there's nothing you can do with less running (or more) that you can't also do when it isn't running.
[01:33] <Kannix> Hi all
[01:33] <bun-bun> sethk# i was thinking along the lines of how it processes the file that something may (or may not) happen
[01:33] <xSUSHi> hi Kannix
[01:34] <mepaYancho> and another problem pls :) i have server files on cdrom .. how can i use them as a normal hdd? the file is a .run
[01:34] <kitche> bun-bun: they are mostly used to just scroll up and down
[01:34] <jvai> if i set firefox to use sock5, will it use opennssh to connet?
[01:34] <Kannix> well, I have done it. Flattened the old SuSE and installed ubuntu 6.10.
[01:34] <bun-bun> kitche# i'm familiar of what they do, just not how they do it
[01:34] <qc> has ubuntu made any progress with 64-bit users?? as far as streaming flash/windows media stream websites?????
[01:34] <bun-bun> personally i've always used more
[01:35] <Kannix> Now I have the problem I feared: How do I import the backuped maildir into evolution.
[01:35] <grndslm> less is bess
[01:35] <bun-bun> but i've heard arguments to use less
[01:35] <apokryphos> qc: no
[01:35] <bun-bun> and it makes me wonder why
[01:35] <apokryphos> qc: still not biarch
[01:35] <qc> apokryphos: bleh!
[01:35] <Al> Hi there everyone. I recently had a problem with my wireless card and tried a few of the steps on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/acx111?action=show&redirect=WifiDocs%2FDevice%2FAcx111 before realising i didn't have the internet so i couldn't download the stuff i needed to compile my own new version of the acx driver... or something. unfortunately i kinda deleted my /lib/modules/2.6.15-23-386/kernel/drivers/net/wire
[01:35] <kitche> bun-bun: you can always read the documentation for both since it will explain how both work
[01:35] <qc> why not??  rofl
[01:35] <sethk> bun-bun, I can't see it as an issue, really.
[01:35] <Al> and sorry for the long post
[01:35] <Kannix> I have the old Maildir (used to be KMail) on DVD. Any ideas how I can import that into Evolution?
[01:35] <soundray> qc: that's not really an ubuntu issue. Ask Adobe to support amd64 and codec vendors to publish their sources.
[01:35] <bun-bun> sethk# that's what i thought too
[01:36] <grndslm> more or less, they're all the same
[01:36] <Kannix> I checked the settings and the only way seems to be to make a special account and set the "server" to "Maildir", give a path, and that's that.
[01:36] <bun-bun> kitche# thanks for the tip, just asked here in case someone knew the answer off the top of their head
[01:36] <ayush> hi wat to do here
[01:37] <jvai> if i set firefox to use sock5, will it use opennssh to connect?
[01:37] <Kannix> But I want the mail to be accessed from the same account I am using to receive more mail. And I don't want to run fetchmail and put it all in the backup Maildir, just so Evolution can access it.
[01:37] <Kannix> *sigh*

[01:38] <kitche> bun-bun: well they process the file the same way just that less allows moving backwards in a documents and forward where more will only allow forward though a document
[01:39] <mepaYancho> and another problem pls :) i have server files on cdrom .. how can i use them as a normal hdd? the file is a .run - I mounted but i have a dvdrom and a cdwriter - only one got mounted - and i dont know how to unmount either .. any help pls ?
[01:39] <al> can anyone provide me with (the file or a link to the file) /lib/modules/2.6.15-23-386/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/acx/acx.ko for dapper? i kinda deleted mine by accident and i have no idea of how to get it back (i assume i can re-extract from filesystem.squashfs on the cd but i dunno how)
[01:40] <al> also can anyone tell me if i can install edgy over the top of dapper? i wanna keep all my settings and stuff from dapper (i've customised it somewhat and it'd be nice to keep that) but i wanna upgrade to edgy because a few pages in the help wiki say that the acx problems are sorted
[01:40] <n1gke> Greetings once again folks.
[01:41] <kalikiana> al: you can upgrade if you want, but there *may* be problems with foreign packages
[01:41] <al> any ideas?
[01:41] <al> oh
[01:41] <abovett> al - do't know how well it works from the CD but I've updated several dapper systems to edgy online without too much trouble.
[01:41] <n1gke> I am editing a Ubuntu help page and need  an opinion on the chages/suggestions before I sumbit, is there someone who can assist with this please ?
[01:41] <soundray> al: you can upgrade to edgy. That will take care of the acx.ko problem, too
[01:41] <soundray> !upgrade | al
[01:41] <ubotu> al: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[01:42] <al> do you mean upgrade as in through gksu "update-manager -c" ?
[01:42] <ubuntu_newb> I don't have the Ubuntu server disk, where can I get the files to install LAMP on Ubuntu?
[01:42] <al> because unfortunately i have no internet access until the acx thing is sorted :S
[01:42] <akijikan> hello all, I'm looking for some help (of course).  When I did text-install my wireless card was automatically detected, but now that my system was installed, iwconfig doesn't show my wireless card...why?
[01:42] <kalikiana> al: so you will want to use the alternate install disc for that

[01:44] <abovett> thevenin: how are you editing it?
[01:44] <thevenin> well the command i did was vi /etc/network/interfaces
[01:44] <n1gke> boricua, Yes. gaim also does IRC.
[01:44] <bun-bun> kitche# i don't know about the really really old versions of more, but all the versions i've used allow to move backwards in a file
[01:44] <boricua> n1gke: how i dont see the option
[01:44] <abovett> thevenin: Did you use sudo first?
[01:44] <soundray> al: assuming the CD is mounted, run 'find /media/cdrom -name linux-image-2.6.15*deb | xargs sudo dpkg -i '
[01:44] <thevenin> no i am root
[01:45] <akijikan> hello all, I'm looking for some help (of course).  When I did text-install my wireless card was automatically detected, but now that my system was installed, iwconfig doesn't show my wireless card...any suggestions?
[01:45] <kalikiana> boricua: add a new user account and you should be able to select irc
[01:45] <n1gke> boricua, go to TOOLS then ACCOUNTS and add irc infos
[01:45] <dnite> does anyone know of a good bluetooth -> cellphone connection tutorial or software or anything for edgy?? Bluetooth seems pretty set up 'out of box' .. my bluetooth mouse can connect just fine.. and my phone can find, enter a pin, and 'connect' to ubuntu.. but i find 'no services' and sending files to my computer doesn't work..

[01:45] <thevenin> ok thanks
[01:45] <al> soundray: thanks for that tip. i'll check it out
[01:45] <boricua> i see
[01:45] <jordan> soundray: Are you sure that is good advice? there is an upgrade script on the CD ?
[01:46] <jprieur> soundray, sethk : so I tried with vga=ask, it gives me 9 choices and each one fails. I tried with vga=771, then the splash thing with the progress bar appears but there's a bit offset that make I see only 1/4 of it
[01:46] <soundray> jordan: this isn't about upgrading

[01:53] <CorpseFeeder> What is ubuntu-desktop and is there anyway to uninstall just evolution mail by itself without uninstalling ubuntu-desktop as well?
[01:53] <jrib> !ubuntu-desktop | CorpseFeeder
[01:53] <ubotu> CorpseFeeder: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[01:53] <xerophyte> does anybody know where can i find the devhelp books for php bash and stuff i could not find with apt-cache search

[01:54] <penguinfan> hi, i skrewed up my x after updating to efty. how can I set it back to vesa or vga or what ever fallback exist to get atleast any x again?
[01:54] <jordan> akijikan: My guess for why it worked on the install CD and not the install ( it happened to me also ) is that the install CD uses proprietary drivers ( there are probably no open source drivers for your card ) to ensure compatability when installing, but the default ubuntu install does not.
[01:54] <ArrenLex_> I have two old Linux filesystem backups laying about. Is there some easy way to compare these two filesystems and create a new filesystem which combines them, sans duplication?

[01:54] <kalikiana> penguinfan: do a 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[01:55] <penguinfan> thx I will try this
[01:55] <pumpkinhead> do i use /etc/fstab to mount another hard drive
[01:55] <david__> how do i find the multiverse repository?
[01:55] <Kannix> did anybody ever manage to define a "maildir" for an account in Evolution? It requires a Path definition, however, the fileselect-box does not accept simple paths, you always have to chose a specific file. Now, I don't want to make one account per email I have in the maildir.
[01:55] <soundray> penguinfan: look at the backups of your xorg.conf: 'ls -lrt /etc/X11/xorg.conf*' and copy one of them back with 'sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf-XY /etc/X11/xorg.conf'

[01:56] <al> by the by, i'm a total 100% newbie at the whole linux thing (well i've dabbled) but i always wondered... why do we have to bloody compile everything anew? my guess would be different architectures or platforms or somethgin for some reason need things compiled differently.  is it the case that if my friend had ubuntu and compiled something it would work on my computer? or is it tied in to the computer too?
[01:56] <penguinfan> soundray: i already tried this but it seems as if the new aiglx or whatever it is doesn't like my fglrx
[01:56] <abovett> pumpkinhead: you can - not essential but make sit easier
[01:56] <ruda> CorpseFeeder: ubuntu-desktop install gnome , openoffice, evolution and more
[01:56] <penguinfan> soundray: i try to get x atleast in basic resolution back to search for the error
[01:56] <pumpkinhead> tks abovett
[01:56] <arakn0> fdsf
[01:56] <soundray> CorpseFeeder: it ensures that a standard set of packages is installed. It ensures a smooth upgrade between releases.
[01:57] <abovett> pumpkinhead: do you want it mounted every time?
[01:57] <ArrenLex_> CorpseFeeder: It exists so if someone wants to install ubuntu, instead of installing a hundred different packages, they can just apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[01:57] <penguinfan> does anybody know how to scroll back in irssi?
[01:57] <ruda> CorpseFeeder: gimp, and many crap software
[01:57] <clop> hi, it seems like the gnome bittorrent client has a problem in edgy -- if i try to open two torrents, on the second one, it says "socket in use" and doesn't download anything... any fixes for this?

[01:57] <killown> why ubuntu 6.10 install crash in grub install?

[01:58] <sethk> CorpseFeeder, you can uninstall only the pieces you don't want, but why bother?
[01:59] <lllloo> i was able to load embedded videos with Mplayer
[01:59] <LjL> sethk: well, some of them do take up space
[01:59] <sethk> killown, yes, there are other live cds that are less heavy, if you need one.
[01:59] <lllloo> in edgy it just stays white
[01:59] <jordan> al: There are differences between different distributions, like what certain files are called and what versions are installed and where, when you run ./configure it looks at your system to see how it is set up and compile the binary accordingly, so if you compile something for Ubuntu, it likely won't work in Fedora.
[01:59] <killown> sethk, but I say ubuntu 6.10 install
[01:59] <sethk> LjL, yes, but space is so cheap these days.  if you need the space, sure.
[01:59] <penguinfan> jrib, kalikiana : i guess you meant dpkg-regconfigure xserver-xorg-core?
[01:59] <killown> sethk, crash install in grub
[01:59] <al> jordan: but ubuntu works with ubuntu (same version), right?
[01:59] <lllloo> anyone got suggestions
[02:00] <jordan> al, Yes.
[02:00] <jrib> penguinfan: I've always used it as xserver-xorg
[02:00] <al> jordan: i.e. it's just as one would expect an exe not to work in linux. different platform = different way of executing and blah
[02:00] <sethk> killown, I'm not following you.  what are we talking about?
[02:00] <killown> it send bug reportr
[02:00] <thevenin> is nano the same as vi or vim
[02:00] <jrib> thevenin: no
[02:00] <thevenin> oh
[02:00] <thevenin> how do they differ?
[02:00] <killown> sethk, I m trying install ubuntu 6.10 but it crash in grub
[02:00] <penguinfan> jrib: strange this package was not even installed
[02:01] <al> jordan: thanks. pretty much what i thought, just kinda annoyed there aren't precompiled versions for popular distros, but i suppose that would take a long time as there are probably many popular distros
[02:01] <thevenin> because i just used nano to edit /etc/network/interfaces and i reset and it works
[02:01] <jrib> penguinfan: that could be the source of your problem :)  Check for ubuntu-desktop too
[02:01] <killown> after send bug report and install stop
[02:01] <jrib> thevenin: vim is just a different editor
[02:01] <jordan> al, sort of, to be honest I don't know much of the specifics, you might try asking on #ubuntu-offtopic as this isn't really a support question.
[02:01] <thevenin> ok
[02:02] <gigiven> ola
[02:02] <al> jordan: cool. sorry :) and i think i know enough now anyway!
[02:02] <jordan> al, no problem :)
[02:02] <killown> sethk, you has ubuntu 6.10?
[02:02] <sethk> thevenin, different program, similar purpose
[02:02] <kalikiana> penguin-fan: the command i suggested is right, i thought i must be installed in any case
[02:02] <sethk> killown, yes, sure.  any error message?
[02:02] <VR_> hey all, im having trouble with repos. they're kinda slow for me. the security ones at least. i'm not sure if i can use a mirror.
[02:03] <jordan> al, It sounds like an interesting conversation, so I might ask it in offtopic myself.
[02:03] <killown> I dont remember
[02:03] <darwin_> I upgraded to edgy now my gnome seems to logoff when I don't use it for a while is that a new feature?
[02:03] <kalikiana> Last attempt this night: When I connect my Castlenet USB DSL modem, lsusb freezes at usbdev_connectinfo (with strace). Any suggestions?
[02:03] <killown> I install ubuntu 5.10 and upgrade for ubuntu  edgy
[02:04] <lonran_> what can be the reason why the computer turns sudenly off like when the cable is unplugged? it only happens when i am using ubuntu, not windows
[02:04] <abovett> darwin_: is you screensaver kicking in?
[02:04] <jprieur> LjL: with 800*600 in usplah.conf, it's ok when halting the system (I have the centered ubunto logo + progress bar) but on startup there's still the offset
[02:05] <LjL> jprieur: offset...? i must have missed some part, i was left at monitor-says-mode-is-not-supported
[02:06] <jprieur> LjL: using vga=771 is the #kopt line, I don't have the screen message, I have the splash screen but there's a big offset (the top left corner of the splash screen is located at the middle of the screen)
[02:06] <killown> sethk, How i do to install packages of cdrom ubuntu edgy in my box ubuntu breezy?
[02:06] <darwin_> yes it is
[02:06] <Tim90> hey guys i cant run
[02:06] <david__> i tried to search for mplayer with synaptic and it only came back with kmplayer...is that the same?
[02:06] <jprieur> LjL: I don't have this offset when halting the system
[02:06] <Tim90> sh ./runLime.sh
[02:06] <Crescendo_> sh
[02:07] <Crescendo_> ls
[02:07] <LjL> jprieur: uhm, then try with 800x600 in usplash.conf but without the vga option perhaps
[02:07] <Crescendo_> Ooops.
[02:07] <jrib> david__: no, you don't have multiverse
[02:07] <jrib> david__: pastebin your sources.list if you aren't sure why and we can help
[02:07] <lostboyz> i upgraded xubuntu but now when i try to start my computer it stalls and goes to a blinking underscore, any ideas what the problem may be?
[02:07] <jprieur> LjL: already tried, the splash is displayed when halting but I get the screen message back on startup
[02:07] <jordan> lonran_: It may be that your fans aren't working in ubuntu as the BIOS won't let the machine get too hot and shuts it down to prevent overheating ( just a guess )
[02:07] <david__> ok now im confused, how do i get multiverse? i read the things ppl told me
[02:07] <abovett> darwin_: there's an option to tell the screensaver not to lock the screen: can't remember where exactly but I can look if you like.
[02:07] <LjL> jprieur: then i don't know :\
[02:08] <Tim90> Im trying to install lime wire but, sh ./runLime.sh dont work
[02:08] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell david__ about multiverse
[02:08] <david__> it doesnt tell me
[02:08] <darwin_> yea it's not set to I saw that
[02:08] <Crescendo_> Edgy Eft's response time seems a noticeably slower than Dapper Drake... am I imagining things?
[02:08] <jprieur> ok LjL thx anyway ;) that's not big deal, solution will come a day
[02:08] <jrib> david__: pastebin the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:08] <darwin_> and it's a full logoff
[02:08] <lonran_> jordan, it could be, compared with windows, the fans are working much less. how do i fix that?
[02:08] <abovett> darwin_: then I'm not sure - sorry.
=== dustin is now known as Funzo
[02:09] <darwin_> ok I just thought I'd ask
[02:09] <kalikiana> Crescendo_: you mean with a certain program?
[02:09] <darwin_> thanks
[02:09] <kalikiana> Crescendo_: i don't think it's slower in general
[02:09] <Crescendo_> kalikiana, no, altogether - the interface.  Scrollbars.
[02:09] <Crescendo_> Moving windows around.  Pressing buttons.
[02:10] <Verithrax> Hm, how do I enable bitmap fonts on X in Edgy? dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig doesn't give me the option to do so anymore.
[02:10] <Tim90> What does this mean  ./runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[02:10] <kalikiana> Crescendo_: i think it varies, sometimes it's slower, but i don't feel a difference compared to dapper
[02:10] <alexrussell> jordan: remember how 'soundfly' or something gave me a command to run to refresh my kernel as i'd accidentally deleted a file: find /media/cdrom -name linux-image-2.6.15*deb | xargs sudo dpkg -i ? i've just had a little look on my original dapper cd (i assume this is the 'cdrom' he's talking about?) and can find no such file. the big installation image is in cd\casper\filesystem.squashfs
[02:11] <alexrussell> jordan: will this still be okay, or do i change the name to the file? sorry if you have no idea, i can't find the guy who originally tole me the thing, was just wondering if you knew (btw a few mins ago i was the al guy)
[02:11] <ProN00b> anyone got an idea when gaim beta4 will come to edgy ?
[02:11] <VR_> hey all, im having trouble with repos. they're kinda slow for me. the security ones at least. i'm not sure if i can use a mirror.
[02:12] <jordan> alexrussell: I don't know :(
[02:12] <ProN00b> VR_, i heard you can
[02:12] <alexrussell> jordan: cool. thanks anyway
[02:12] <ProN00b> VR_, if you aren't paranoid i am even sure you can
[02:12] <jordan> alexrussell: Actually I may know
[02:12] <alexrussell> jordan: ooh, go on... :)
[02:13] <ProN00b> anyone got an idea when gaim beta4 will come to edgy ?
[02:13] <cynical> ProN00b: theres a deb file floating around in the forums already
[02:13] <ProN00b> cynical, yeah, and i could build it myself
[02:13] <pumpkinhea1> how can i get synaptic to recognize me as superuser
[02:13] <jordan> alexrussell: I think you need to use the alternate install CD
[02:13] <ProN00b> cynical, but when is it coming to the official repos ?
[02:13] <cynical> ah, no idea
[02:14] <hiffy> woa. What every happened to the tty's in 6.10? I press ctrl-alt-f# and nothing happens
[02:14] <jrib> pumpkinhea1: it should prompt you for your password
[02:14] <hiffy> *ever happened
[02:14] <pumpkinhea1> it's not... :(
[02:14] <ryanakca> what package provides libgobject-2.0?
[02:14] <alexrussell> jordan: ahh i had a feeling that might be the case. well i'm downloading the edgy alternate cd now so i can do the "offline upgrade" that it promises, so i may as well just do that. cheers for the help!
[02:14] <kalikiana> pumpkinhea1: then do 'gksudo synaptic'
[02:14] <jordan> hiffy: I have the same problem, I think it has to do with what they did with the new upsplash.
[02:14] <lostsync> anyone got any ideas on how to get my clock to actually display the proper time?  the panel applet crashes any time i try to use it to correct it.
[02:15] <sethk> hiffy, hasn't changed, you must have clobbered your config somehow during the install.
[02:15] <VR_> ProN00b: how can i?
[02:15] <mygod> I can't install netbeans  there are more segment errors
[02:15] <sethk> lostsync, you can use ntp-update, but it shouldn't crash.
[02:15] <hiffy> sethk: There wasn't anything to clobber. I just clicked through everything
[02:15] <pumpkinhea1> kali ok that did it
[02:15] <ProN00b> VR_, find a mirror and change it in your sources.list file
[02:15] <jordan> sethk: On my machine, the tty's only work when I don't use the Edgy upsplash.
[02:15] <VR_> ProN00b: i'm not sure how.
[02:15] <sethk> hiffy, I didn't mean you did something wrong, I mean during the install something went wrong
[02:15] <sethk> jordan, that's bizarre.
[02:16] <pumpkinhea1> one more thing, in terminal i type su root, give pw and access denied ???:-/
[02:16] <VR_> ProN00b: i know i have to edit the sources.list, but i dont know which part i need to change.
[02:16] <sethk> jordan, I"m trying to imagine how that can happen.
[02:16] <lostsync> sethk, gnome's applet crashes...it's been fixed on gnome's end but ubuntu hasn't got the fix in the repos yet for whatever reason according to bugzilla
[02:16] <hiffy> sethk: :P. Sorry, didn't mean to sound defensive.
[02:16] <sethk> lostsync, ok, then ntp-update will work for you, most likely.
[02:16] <ProN00b> VR_, the things that look like urls ^^
[02:16] <jordan> sethk: I am on a mac though so it's probably Apple's incomplete BIOS emulation.
[02:16] <kalikiana> pumpkinhea1: type just su to get root
[02:16] <sethk> hiffy, I didn't take it that way.
[02:16] <pumpkinhea1> did that too
[02:16] <lostsync> sethk, i used ntp-update but after a reboot it sets the time back to what i guess is UTC
[02:16] <sethk> jordan, hmm ...
[02:16] <VR_> ProN00b: ha, yes, so even the "security" ones?
=== jaebird_ is now known as jaebird
[02:16] <kalikiana> pumpkinhea1: then maybe you did not create a root password?
[02:17] <sethk> lostsync, I guess you can't set the clocks time zone, either, or it will crash.
[02:17] <pumpkinhea1> no i didn't, just a user pw, how do i do it?
[02:17] <abovett> pumpkinhea1: have you tried sudo -s
[02:17] <hiffy> Dapper seems to have gone a bit more smoothly last time.
[02:18] <pumpkinhea1> ok cool kali thanks
[02:18] <lostsync> sethk, would installing ntpd help?  <= 6.06 had a time synchronize at boot, i'm guessing ntpd was what was doing it?
[02:18] <pumpkinhea1> have to figure out why this works this way later
[02:18] <sethk> hiffy, I always, always, wait a couple of weeks after a release.
[02:18] <sethk> lostsync, correct, yes, but it would also probably use utc, if ntp-update did
[02:18] <Onashi> I have an Nvidia card, what's the name of the driver package that I need?
[02:18] <jvai> u ppl r trailbazers
[02:18] <Onashi> Propreitery ones
[02:19] <jordan> sethk: Do you think it is worth a try to have hiffy disable upsplash and see if that helps like it did for me?
[02:19] <hiffy> sethk: Do they backport updates to the distro ISO's often? My distro-upgrade maneuver completely flopped; this is me trying through the cd.
[02:19] <jvai> isnt it too soon for breezy?
[02:19] <ProN00b> VR_, i heard you can as the packages are signed now
[02:19] <sethk> jordan, yes.  I don't understand what's going on, so I can't be sure it isn't a factor.  and it's an easy thing to test.
[02:19] <kalikiana> pumpkinhea1: do 'sudo passwd root' i think
[02:19] <alexrussell> sethk: i was just about to ask. it seems to many people are having a few minorish problems in edgy, do you (and others?) recommend i wait a little bit before installing it? i'm not mch of a linux guy so i probably won't know how to solve much of anythgin that may happen to me. i'm currently on dapper and other than wireless it's all good for me.
[02:19] <Yancho> anyone has an idea on which package i need to install for this one pls? : The setup program seems to have failed on x86/glibc-2.1
[02:19] <hiffy> jordan: always worth a try; I'm unfamiliar with the mechanism that enables ttys.
[02:19] <VR_> ProN00b: i see. and the mirrors are listed someplace in the wiki, right?
=== luisbg is now known as luisbg_zZzZZzZz
[02:20] <sethk> alexrussell, yes, not because of anything specific, just because of the normal just released things.  This is a large system and no matter what, things come up.
[02:20] <jordan> hiffy: It is a kernel parameter, but I am no good at helping people with grub ( I use lilo )
[02:20] <ProN00b> VR_, yeah, i think so
[02:20] <Tim90> What does this mean >?./runLime.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")
[02:20] <cynical> alexrussell: I've read that some people who installed software via automatix had issues after upgrading and that the automatix team was working on preventing it in future releases
[02:20] <hiffy> jordan: oy vey.
[02:20] <alexrussell> sethk: yeah. to be honest i probably wouldn't normally wanna upgarde for a few weeks, it's just that wireless is my only access to the internet so i may be forced into it by stupid acx stuff
[02:21] <cynical> alexrussell: but personally I didn't have a single problem (maybe I was one of the few..)
[02:21] <c_lisp> how can I change the theme background of my pc booting up ubuntu?
[02:21] <sethk> alexrussell, well, then you are taking a risk that you understand, which is perfectly ok.
[02:21] <VR_> ProN00b: thanks
[02:21] <abovett> Tim90: Sounds like there's a bug in the runLime.sh script!
[02:21] <alexrussell> cynical: interesting. i'm currently downloading the edgy alternate cd so i can do an offline upgrade (my internet's out at the mo) so you think that'll go alright?
[02:21] <sethk> cynical, many people don't have problems.  Most, in fact, although I can't prove that of course.
[02:22] <lib8264q> hello channel
[02:22] <alexrussell> sethk, cynical: i'll probably just go for it. no doubt you'll see me back in a few days if i had any problems with it! :D
[02:22] <jordan> sethk: It is a kernel parameter, but I am no good at helping people with grub ( I use lilo )
[02:22] <cynical> sethk: yeah I've been wondering about that myself.  I havent seen a single problem that everyone is having
[02:22] <hiffy> sethk: heh. We've got enough anecdotal evidence to fill a book - there's even a /. story.
[02:22] <sethk> jordan, you do essentially the same thing with grub, only in /boot/grub/menu.lst, and on the same line as the kernel name
[02:22] <gubluntu> should i be using my machine at all during a dis-upgrade?
[02:22] <ubuntu_newb> ok now I'm on my Ubuntu system
[02:22] <DigitalNinja> I've got an EPoX 6100 motherboard with a nvidia 6100 video card built in. I added a NX7600GT nvidia card. When I look at the Xorg.0.log file it says I have two GPU's. Shouldn't it say I only have one?
[02:22] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed LAMP on Ubuntu\
[02:22] <ubuntu_newb> was easy as hell
[02:23] <cynical> alexrussell: ha, I upgraded via the net so I'm sure you wont have any trouble upgrading from the cd, gl tho!
[02:23] <sethk> hiffy, yes, indeed, but remember that, on a help channel, you find people who need help.  :)
[02:23] <ToCo> Hello good people! I'm first time using IRC and for first time trying to install ubuntu, and ofc i got stuck :-) may i ask here my questions?
[02:23] <ubuntu_newb> now I can't configure my passwords and all
[02:23] <alexrussell> cynical: cheers
[02:23] <jordan> sethk: In lilo I add the line "append=splash"
[02:23] <sethk> hiffy, so statistically it doesn't prove anything, either way.
[02:23] <ubuntu_newb> I can't find where to put files
[02:23] <hiffy> sethk: details! And, hence the anecdotal evidence tagline.
[02:23] <sethk> jordan, in grub, you don't use append=, you just put    splash     at the end of the kternl line.
[02:23] <jordan> sethk: To turn it on at least
[02:23] <ubuntu_newb> where the apache's httpd.conf file is
[02:23] <jano> q wea pasa aca
[02:23] <sethk> hiffy, yes.
[02:23] <jano> xupenlo
[02:23] <Sensae> Hello
[02:23] <sethk> hiffy, and I'm not really disagreeing with you, just saying that the magnitude of the problem is unknown

[02:24] <jano> hellow my lidy
[02:24] <abovett> ToCo: what do you want to know?
[02:24] <lib8264q> what is a good  gui to manage a lamp install ?
[02:24] <gubluntu> is there a edgy channel?
[02:24] <alexrussell> jordan, sethk: talking about grub. ubuntu helpfully added grub and set it up so that i had ubuntu forst, then a couple more ubuntus and then finally windows. i'd like to make it so that windows is at the top (i.e. timeout default) is it simple enough? if i do it in the boot menu i'd have to edit the commands as far as i can see
[02:24] <Tim90> abovett: thanks
[02:24] <ubuntu_newb> that's what I need to
[02:24] <ubuntu_newb> a gui to manage my lamp install
[02:24] <hiffy> sethk: Oh well.
[02:24] <sethk> alexrussell, you just move it to the top in the file.
[02:25] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed lamp on ubuntu?  What is a good control panel/gui to use for configuring it?
[02:25] <sethk> alexrussell, before the block for what is currently the first, as you intuited.
[02:25] <alexrussell> sethk: the /boot/whatever file you just mentioned to jordan?
[02:25] <vidd> what is the command to find your ip address?
[02:25] <sethk> alexrussell, he was asking how to add a kernel parameter in grub, and I said add it to the end of the line that specifies the kernel
[02:25] <sethk> vidd, ifconfig
[02:25] <vidd> ty
[02:25] <ubuntu_newb> just go to http://whatsmyip.org
[02:26] <ToCo> abovett, im trying to install ubuntu on a computer with only 128 mb of ram. it hangs when i run that "install" icon on desktop. so i managed to find that i need to download Alternate version of Ubuntu, but cant find anywhere link to it. found some for 6.06 (if im not mistaken) and ubuntu is 6.10. can you provide me a link to file which i need to download?
[02:26] <alexrussell> sethk: but if i wanna move windows to the top of the list i do it in /boot/grub/menu.lst ? (the filename pretty much gives me a huge yes to that question but it's worth making sure!)?
[02:26] <sethk> ubuntu_newb, that's to find out your public address if you are behind a NAT box.  I was telling him how to display the machines real address.
[02:26] <sethk> alexrussell, right, that's the file.
[02:26] <jordan> sethk: So Tell him how to delete the splash parameter temporarily at boot ( I think grub can do that )
[02:26] <abovett> ToCo: Hold on a sec- I'll just check...
[02:26] <ubuntu_newb> oh you mean his local IP on the network?
[02:27] <zecamarada>  Algum ae j teve problemas com UTF-8 no BRoffice??
[02:27] <sethk> jordan, I don't remember the kernel switch for it.
[02:27] <lib8264q> think you need the alternitive install text based installer
[02:27] <jordan> sethk: I think it is just splash

[02:29] <zecamarada> I'm in #ubuntu-br
[02:29] <zecamarada> =D
[02:29] <sethk> Yancho, it's renamed to libc on disk and in the package manager
[02:29] <hiffy> there you go. Have fun.
[02:29] <Yancho> sethk what you mean? is there any way i can check if it really exists pls ?
[02:29] <vidd> ubuntu_newb Im writing a document on how to set up apache
[02:29] <Yancho> a okis :)
[02:30] <sethk> Yancho, sure,  ls -l /lib/libc*
[02:30] <ayush> hi
[02:30] <Psi-Jack> Heh. And here I am, messing around with Roxen. :)
[02:30] <ubuntu_newb> well it's already installed but I don't know how to set up databases and users and all that
[02:30] <Yancho> Package libc is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[02:30] <Yancho> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[02:30] <Yancho> is only available from another source
[02:30] <quintin> ubuntu_newb: might try phpmyadmin
[02:30] <vidd> <ubuntu_newb> thats what im documenting
[02:30] <LjL> bazz: type "encrypted filesystem site:help.ubuntu.com" into google
[02:30] <sethk> Yancho, the package name is libc6, not libc
[02:30] <Yancho> a oki :)
[02:30] <sethk> Yancho, but that has nothing to do with the ls command I gave you
[02:31] <abovett> ToCo: have a look at http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/ and scroll down to the Alternate section
[02:31] <lib8264q> can someone tell me what extension is after the /etc/apt/preferences file
[02:31] <sethk> Yancho, the ls command was to show the primary file of that package, which is libc.so.#  (# is 5 or 6 usually)
[02:31] <quintin> ubuntu_newb: read the mysql documentation.  to get started, try 'create database test; use test; grant all privileges on test.* to user@localhost identified by 'gandalf''
[02:31] <sethk> lib8264q, none
[02:31] <Yancho> a oki sethk .. i have it infact :|
[02:31] <ubuntu_newb> What is the default root password on mysql when you first install LAMP?
[02:31] <sethk> lib8264q, extensions are unnecessary in unix, although they are allowed as names
[02:31] <akijikan> can someone help me with modelines for xorg.cong?
[02:31] <Yancho> libc-2.4.so etc
[02:31] <quintin> ubuntu_newb: there genereally isn't a root pw for mysql.  that's why I advised changing it
[02:32] <Yancho> erm so how can i install this package pls ? :S
[02:32] <vidd> <ubuntu_newb> got to www.linux.org/lessons/advanced/index.html
[02:33] <bazz> LjL: thanks :)
[02:33] <vandit2k7> Hi I am having problems with my ATI driver can anybody help\
[02:33] <vidd> i have printer set up
[02:33] <gubluntu> should i be using my machine at all during a dis-upgrade?
[02:33] <sticazzi> vandit2k7, what's the problem?
[02:33] <sethk> Yancho, right.  now, there are two glibc versions that you typically need, because some programs only work with the older glibc (version 5)
[02:33] <morphish> i can just dump  /var/cache/apt/archives/* , right?
[02:34] <vidd> the local machine can print to it, the XP machine can print to it, but my linux laptop cant
[02:34] <sethk> Yancho, I forget what the equivalent of v5 is in the 2.X notation
[02:34] <bazz> LjL: hmm, although this seems to require knowing how much data i want apriori.  ideally i'd like to be able to copy and delete and have the file grow and shrink accordingly
[02:34] <sethk> Yancho, the package has libc5 in it.  might be libc5, or that might be just part of the package name
[02:34] <TIger_IT> Somebody know how tell to hdparm ... Ive udma mode!!!
[02:34] <TIger_IT> udma7
[02:34] <Yancho> sethk : im following this tutorial - maybe it can help :S http://tjw.org/etded/
[02:34] <vidd> I installed gnome-cups-manager
[02:34] <ubuntu_newb> ok I used phpmyadmin to change my root password for mysql
[02:35] <ubuntu_newb> I figured that part out.
[02:35] <Railer> hey what is the apt-get command that checks if you already have a progam installed?
[02:35] <TIger_IT> hdparm.......... is set in udma2 :(
[02:35] <ubuntu_newb> now to find my files on an ubuntu system
[02:35] <LjL> bazz, i've never really done that. you're a bit on your own i'm afraid, unless someone else chirps in. try #ubuntu-offtopic as well
[02:35] <ToCo> good night to everyone!
[02:35] <bazz> LjL:  okay, thanks
[02:35] <gubluntu> is there a edgy channel?
[02:35] <sethk> bazz, I don't know of a program that uses a dynamic block for that purpose.  good idea, but I don't know whether it exists.
[02:35] <TIger_IT> ubuntu_newb:  use finde
[02:35] <TIger_IT> ubuntu_newb:  use find
[02:35] <ubuntu_newb> where would my user accounts be created for LAMP?
[02:35] <rimad> so ubuntu is using apt to keep itself up to date right?
[02:35] <ubuntu_newb> home/username/httpdocs?
[02:35] <rimad> can yum be used?
[02:35] <iter> yum ugh
[02:35] <gubluntu> yucky
[02:36] <iter> yum takes 5 mins to tell you packagename isn't available
[02:36] <bazz> sethk: hrm, so i pretty much have to have a fixed size huh?
[02:36] <TIger_IT> Somebody know how tell to hdparm ... Ive udma7 mode!!!  please!

[02:36] <rimad> i use fedora for my ...server purposes
[02:36] <ryanakca> what package provides libgobject-2.0?
[02:36] <rimad> and wanted ubuntu on my laptop
[02:36] <sethk> bazz, as far as I know, yes.  could be something recent that I don't know about, though.
[02:36] <rimad> i use yum for fedora ;)
[02:36] <sethk> bazz, otherwise, that's a good thing to write if you have time on your hands.  :)
[02:36] <akijikan> can someone help me with modelines for xorg.conf?
[02:36] <LjL> !find libgobject | ryanakca
[02:36] <ubotu> Package/file libgobject does not exist in edgy
[02:37] <sethk> rimad, as a practical matter, I'd say no.  if you want ubuntu, use dpkg.  dpkg is really very easy to use.
[02:37] <TIger_IT> I need some support.........
[02:37] <bazz> sethk:  okay, thanks, wish i did have the time

[02:37] <ryanakca> LjL: I've looked on packages.ubuntu.com and in apt-cache... and it's a dependency for amarok, according to http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Media_Device:IPod#Artwork_not_working
[02:38] <LjL> ryanakca: well, the bot is lying. look at libglib2.0-0 and -dev

[02:39] <ryanakca> LjL: kk, ty
[02:39] <Dextorion> deforamtive: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[02:39] <LjL> ryanakca: what?
[02:39] <gubluntu> deformative, you want to disable gdm from starting on boot? or just stop it?
[02:39] <ryanakca> LjL: /msg the bot
[02:39] <JoseStefan> hi
[02:39] <deforamtive> Dextorion,  no I mean disable it in the startup script,  I am assuming from that that init.conf is the startup script.
[02:39] <deforamtive> Stop it from starting.
[02:39] <iter> deformative: update-rc.d -f gdm remove
[02:39] <LjL> ryanakca: it was for yancho actually
[02:39] <Dextorion> upd..
[02:40] <Dextorion> deforamtive: what iter said :)
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> I keep getting this error: can't find swap space signature anyone know how to fix that?
[02:40] <deforamtive> Alright,  thankyou.
[02:40] <iter> Dextorion: also there are runlevels in debian
[02:40] <vandit2k7> Hi I have problems with ATI driver..can anybody help please?
[02:40] <Megaqwerty> *"can't find swap space signature"
[02:40] <sethk> Megaqwerty, mkswap, but be sure you are pointing at swap, not file space
[02:40] <gubluntu> vandit2k7, just ask
[02:40] <gubluntu> vandit2k7, if someone can help, theyll answer
[02:40] <ryanakca> LjL: ah, kk
[02:40] <iter> Dextorion: and scripts for the runlevel are in /etc/rcN.d
[02:40] <Yancho> LjL if it is there then why cant my system find it? :S
[02:40] <sethk> Megaqwerty, dangerous command, if you use the wrong /dev/hd##, you might clobber a file system
[02:41] <Dextorion> iter: uhm.. do you mean deforamtive ? :p
[02:41] <Megaqwerty> Does anyone have a better (safer) way?
[02:41] <iter> haha
[02:41] <iter> whoops
[02:41] <Dextorion> iter: ;) ;)
[02:41] <sethk> Megaqwerty, there are gui tools you can use.  you should find a disk manager tool on your menus

[02:41] <ryanakca> how do I uninstall kde4base ?
[02:42] <gubluntu> apt-get remove kde4base
[02:42] <gubluntu> if its a package
[02:42] <Megaqwerty> sethk: gnome partition manager?
[02:42] <ryanakca> how do I uninstall kde4base ? (yes, I have been sudo apt-get --purge remove kde4base )
[02:42] <vandit2k7> Hi I installed ATi driver from the add/remove but when screen saver starts running its working for a while but then it kicks me out and logs me off but doesn't crash gnome or xserver just logs me off
[02:42] <vandit2k7> what do  I do?
[02:42] <sethk> Megaqwerty, sounds reasonable.  I use kde so I can't check it easily.
[02:42] <LjL> Yancho, the fact that the bot lists it (which it doesn't, actually) doesn't mean you have it installed
[02:43] <gubluntu> ubotu tell vandit2k7 about ati
[02:43] <Megaqwerty> sethk: ah. I think the real name is gparted
[02:43] <gubluntu> vandit2k7, use that howto
[02:43] <jordan> vandit2k7: Does it bring you back to the GDM?
[02:43] <ryanakca> gubluntu: tried that
[02:43] <Yancho> LjL is there a way to check where each file is in which package? so i can install the package pls ?
[02:43] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Yancho about apt-file
[02:43] <vandit2k7> jordan yes it just logs me out like I hve to type my user name and password
[02:43] <LjL> Yancho: i think your best bet is libncurses5-dev
[02:43] <gubluntu> ryanakca: whats the output?
[02:44] <Yancho> great LjL :) ill do what u told me .. many thanks
[02:44] <ryanakca> gubluntu: forget, tried that about a week ago
[02:44] <gubluntu> ryanakca: try again :-D
[02:44] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Yancho about packages
[02:44] <gubluntu> sudo apt-get remove kde4base
[02:44] <LjL> Yancho: those are other possibilities. packages.ubuntu.com is handy
[02:44] <ryanakca> gubluntu: I'm trying to rinstall kubuntu-desktop, but I can't install it with kde4base remnants kicking around

[02:45] <gubluntu> ryanakca: try remove again, and then tell me what it ouputs
[02:45] <ryanakca> gubluntu: ok, it's uninstalled, but it left remnants..
[02:46] <gubluntu> ryanakca: msg me the output
[02:46] <ryanakca> gubluntu: it has been uninstalled since last weekend.. but, it's dependencies or something is left kicking around

[02:53] <Pelo> Poseidon,  or you can get a torrent
[02:53] <Megaqwerty> sethk: Thank you for your help. I did it!
[02:53] <Megaqwerty> Poseidon: Do you already have Ubuntu?
[02:53] <Poseidon> no i just want to http link

[02:54] <Poseidon> thanks
[02:54] <cynikal> np
[02:54] <cynikal> Railer: then it will tell you that you already have it installed

[02:56] <nbh758> I am having problems with Amaya browser
[02:56] <nbh758> It blinks on then gone
[02:57] <nbh758> any ideas?
[02:57] <e_machinist> Am I missing a repository? GnomeSword is at version 2.1.7 in the edgy reps., but only at 2.1.5 in the dapper reps. Am I missing a backport rep or something?
[02:57] <Pelo> nbh758,  uninstall, completely,  then re-install
[02:57] <Megaqwerty> Does anyone know how I can import all my mail and settings into evolution? (I'm using Thunderbird)
[02:57] <Yancho> LjL - installed all the packages which sounded like it .. now .. trying again if it works hehe
[02:57] <grndslm> what do you guys think the easiest way to transfer files on a local network between windows & ubuntu are??  ftp?
[02:57] <nbh758> I have tried that several times
[02:57] <Pelo> Megaqwerty,  there is an import option in evolution,  under files
[02:58] <cynikal> grndslm: samba definitely
[02:58] <Pelo> grndslm, ,  samba and shared folder
[02:58] <Megaqwerty> Pelo: Yes, but that won't work seeing as Thunderbird isn't an older version of Evolution
[02:58] <grndslm> samba's that's the easiest, really?
[02:59] <cynikal> grndslm: its incredibly easy in ubuntu. Just create a folder, for example, named shared in your home directory. Then right click on it and choose share folder. It will install samba and configure everything for you
[02:59] <sethk> grndslm, depends.  samba can be tricky to set up.
[02:59] <e_machinist> Where can I find a list of all available repositories?
[02:59] <sethk> grndslm, I use sftp, which is just like ftp only secure.  if you install cygwin on the windows box, then you have both sides
[02:59] <Chipper> e_machinist: google
[02:59] <e_machinist> Chipper, done.
[02:59] <sethk> grndslm, there are many ways
[02:59] <Pelo> Megaqwerty,  when I tried to import my old stuff,   evolution searched for info from several clients, including thunderbird
[02:59] <grndslm> cynikal...ok, will try your suggestion first
[02:59] <thinkl> I'm switching from Windows and am trying to edit webpages. On our windows machines, I can open files on our webserver directly from explorer through some kind of magic. Does anyone know what that magic is and how I reproduce it in linux? I can't ftp into our server or ssh in so this must be something else...
[02:59] <jordan> !repositories | e_machinist
[02:59] <ubotu> e_machinist: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[03:00] <Megaqwerty> Pelo: Huh, it didn't find Thunderbird for me.
[03:00] <azureal> hi...is there some simple way to revert to default ubuntu sound settings?  it does not seem to be kernel dependent, so it's really been a headache...atm it won't even recognize my soundcard =/
[03:00] <dave> anyone know how i can make xinerama work better with gnome?
[03:00] <Megaqwerty> pelo: oh, wait. I think I see how. thanks
[03:00] <nbh758> You can access repositories through synaptic package manager
[03:00] <sethk> thinkl, sounds like you are remotely mounting the drives.  windows calls it "mapping a share" so you won't know you are mounting a file system and can do it anywhere, not just in windows.  :)
[03:01] <e_machinist> meh, I already got all of the repositories apparently.
[03:01] <sethk> thinkl, seriously, you can do exactly the same thing in linux, in several ways.
[03:01] <sethk> thinkl, or, you can ssh into the linux box itself, and edit them there.  lots of options
[03:01] <jordan> azureal: Possibly through dpkg-reconfigure -phigh
[03:01] <Poseidon> i want make a dual-boot of XP and ubuntu.but i have no exprience to do that
[03:01] <meatwad64> is lame available on 6.10?
[03:01] <thinkl> sethk -- It doesn't look like a drive being mounted.
[03:01] <cynikal> grndslm: sure let me know how it turns out
[03:01] <sethk> thinkl, you don't bring up a file explorer and click on the html files?
[03:02] <nbh758> you have access to all repositories, may will be downloaded as you select them
[03:02] <azureal> jordan what does phigh do?
[03:02] <UKMatt> What does it mean when "%U" and things like that are tacked on to the end of commands?
[03:02] <sethk> thinkl, I'm not a windows expert, there are other ways to do it in windows.
[03:02] <meatwad64> i have universe enbaled
[03:02] <e_machinist> Poseidon: just save yourself some trouble and buy two hard drives.
[03:02] <sethk> thinkl, what you described sounds to me as if you had the files mounted, but as I said, I'm not a windows expert
[03:02] <thinkl> sethk: There's a little arrow-y button thing in windows that opens it up. I then have to enter a name and password and I can save directly to the webserver from Word or Frontpage or whatever.
[03:02] <dave> Poseidon , if you have a good amount of memory , i highly recommend Vmware
[03:02] <Pelo> Poseidon,   when instaling you will be asked to partition the drive,   ubu should let you specify part of your hdd for ubu,  then it will install  grub wiich will let you select which  OS to boot at startup
[03:02] <sethk> thinkl, it isn't going to be as seemless in linux as that.
[03:02] <jordan> azureal: It only asks high priority questions.
[03:02] <dave> i run vmware on linux and just fire it up when i need something windows only
[03:03] <Megaqwerty> Pelo: nope. Can't figure it out.
[03:03] <thinkl> sethk: I'm not a windows expert either ;) I'm just trying to figure how this stuff works -- it's not ftp or ssh or ntp...
[03:03] <azureal> jordan, what do you propose I reconfigure?
[03:03] <grndslm> cynikal...wow, setting up samba wasy incredibly easy...now how do i connect the windows machine to my local ip?
[03:03] <ubuntu_> I accidently fried my mbr(as in deleted it completely) I'm booted to ubuntu live. how do I restore grub/mbr?
[03:03] <sethk> thinkl, you can use open office to edit the files, similarly to the way you do it with word, but you'll have to move the files from and to the web server, or remotely mount them
[03:03] <UKMatt> What does it mean when "%U" and things like that are tacked on to the end of commands?
[03:03] <Pelo> Megaqwerty,  try searching the ubuntu forum for an answer
[03:03] <jordan> azureal: I don't know to be honest.
[03:03] <JoseStefan> !mbr > ubuntu_
[03:03] <Megaqwerty> Pelo: okay.
[03:03] <thinkl> sethk: Right -- I actually have a pretty good understanding of linux. What I don't know is what protocol one uses to access this webserver.
[03:03] <sethk> thinkl, once you mount them so they look local, you can edit them with open office.  but we are just talking about straight html here
[03:04] <sethk> thinkl, you can use nfs, you can use samba to mount

[03:04] <sethk> thinkl, or you can edit them on the server and point the display back at your workstation.
[03:04] <cynikal> grndslm: Yeah I love it :D   Either give your machine a static ip and connect using something like "smb://192.168.2.2" in a browser on your windows machine, or use your hostname, like "smb://pirat"
[03:04] <azureal> luckily aplay -l  outputs no soundcards... oh wow
[03:04] <timbobsteve> i am running OSX/Xubuntu on my ibook G3, but everytime I switch OS's the time is all out of whack because the previous OS has modified it. Any ideas on how to fix this? I searched the forums and found nothing related to macs and time.
[03:04] <cynikal> grndslm: if you are on a windows machine you would type "//192.168.2.2" or "//hostname"
[03:05] <e_machinist> Guess I'm just gonna have to put Edgy on here to get access to the newer stuff.
[03:05] <grndslm> cynikal...thanks, you're the man
[03:05] <thinkl> sethk: but I'm pretty sure this is different from a samba mount (I use that to mount our windows drives on our fileserver).
[03:05] <Poseidon> do you mean I have to save an empty partition for ubuntu ?
[03:05] <cynikal> grndslm: np :D
[03:05] <pumpkinhead> is there an easier way to get to a terminal besides applications>accessories>terminal
[03:06] <Vornotron> You can drag any icon from that whole menu onto the upper bar and it will stay there permanently.
[03:06] <abovett> pumpkinhead: You can put it on the panel or assign a shortcut key
[03:06] <MERLIN_MONROE> somebody can help me?
[03:06] <jramsey> any pointers on the internel linux disk block i/o system documentation? i've a special application that requires intercepting block read/write requests
[03:06] <pumpkinhead> tks abovett
[03:06] <sethk> thinkl, yes, it is, I'm thinking of ways you could handle it that would have a similar feel
[03:06] <thinkl> MERLIN_MONROE: ask your question
[03:06] <thinkl> sethk: Ah -- key point -- I don't control the server.
[03:07] <sethk> thinkl, although I'd be surprised if, under the covers, it isn't just a samba mount in windows, even if it doesn't look that way.
[03:07] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> How to copy a data from my Linux partition to an NTFS one?
[03:07] <thinkl> sethk: I've just been banging my head against a wall trying to figure out what the server is using to communicate with windows.
[03:07] <Music_Shuffle> pumpkinhead: or if you're on Gnome, just just alt-f2 and chcek the box labelled "Run in Terminal" xD
[03:07] <Music_Shuffle> just use*
[03:07] <sethk> thinkl, run a packet sniffer when you are editing, you'll find out quickly enough
[03:07] <baxter_kylie> Hi. Having issue with file permissions. The no amount of chmodding seems to stick. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot?
[03:07] <grndslm> cynikal...i tried to connect, but the user/pass didn't work
[03:07] <pumpkinhead> thanks musicshuffle
[03:08] <Rappermas> does anyone know of a tool that I can use to record a video of my desktop?
[03:08] <pumpkinhead> is there a gui filemanager you can run as root
[03:08] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : How to copy a data from my Linux partition to an NTFS one?
[03:08] <jrib> Rappermas: istanbul is such a tool (when it decides to work)
[03:08] <Pelo> baxter_kylie,  what are you trying to do ?  you could user the terminal and launch  nautilus with  gksu nautilus
[03:08] <sethk> pumpkinhead, any file manager can be run as root
[03:08] <Rappermas> jrib: will take a look
[03:08] <MERLIN_MONROE> thinkl =/
[03:08] <rjm> hey
[03:08] <Pelo> pumpkinhead,  from the terminal   gksu  nautilus
[03:08] <cynikal> grndslm: hmm, you shouldn't need one
[03:09] <Rappermas> reason i ask is i'm trying to show off AIGLX
[03:09] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: Have you successfully mounted an the NTFS partition?
[03:09] <pumpkinhead> thank you pelo and seth
[03:09] <grndslm> cynikal, will try again
[03:09] <spiderworm> anyone running up against the edgy cannot connect to pptp vpn problem?
[03:09] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : yes. It automatically mounts my partition
[03:09] <rjm> my ubuntu dapper box updated itself while i was away.  when i got home and logged in, i no longer have sound in macromedia flash.
[03:09] <rjm> http://www.macewan.org/2006/06/01/howto-firefox-flash-video-sound-on-ubuntu-linux-dapper/
[03:09] <rjm> i tried this - didn't work
[03:09] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: Then copying should be simple -- you can use your file manager or cp or what have you. What error are you getting when you try to copy?
[03:10] <jramsey> any pointers on the internel linux disk block i/o system documentation? i've a special application that requires intercepting block read/write requests
[03:10] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : some message that the partitions are read only
[03:10] <cynikal> AlanHaggai|Sleep: If you want ntfs write support you can use the ntfs-3g driver. Here is a tutorial on how to set that up. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009
[03:10] <grndslm> cynikal...it definitely needs a user/pass... it won't let me hit ok without at least a username
[03:10] <Pelo> cynikal,  is it reliable ?
[03:11] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: So the NTFS drives are being mounted read only. That could be because the computer that's sharing them is only allowing a read-only mount.
[03:11] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : it's in my computer itself
[03:11] <cynikal> Pelo: Yes, I've been using it for months and transferring large and small files (even 4GB dvd's) without a single error
[03:11] <cynikal> Pelo: Unfortunately it could be much faster, I hope they will work on performance in the future
[03:11] <Pelo> cynikal,  thanks, I'll make a note
[03:12] <highneko> How good is this computer? http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=0665000FS10079854&catid=10607&logon=&langid=EN
[03:12] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: Sorry -- mixing up ntfs with nfs in my head.
[03:12] <cynikal> grndslm: strange, would you mind showing me what your /etc/samba/smb.conf file looks like?
[03:12] <TIger_IT> How can i enable udma7 mode? please........Ive tried in several ways!
[03:12] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : no problem
[03:12] <Pelo> cynikal,  I use diskmounter right now and the write feature is not relaible so I only use it in read
[03:12] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: IIRC, it is not safe to write to an NTFS drive with the linux driver.
[03:12] <sethk> TIger_IT, hdparm
[03:12] <Poseidon> is ubuntu available on laptop?
[03:12] <meatwad64> has anyone installed lame on edgy?
[03:12] <sethk> TIger_IT, you may also have to enable it in the machine's BIOS
[03:12] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thinkl : why?
[03:12] <Rappermas> ntfs-3g can be used to write to NTFS
[03:12] <Pelo> TIger_IT,  look it up in the forum , maybe you'll find the answer there
[03:13] <tk_> Hi there... I have a question about swat : i have installed the package und have tryt to connect to swat http daemon with http://localhost:901 but i become a timeout , how can  i start the swat daemon if they are stopped ? can anyone help me ?
=== ClassEmbassy is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[03:13] <thinkl> AlanHaggai|Sleep: So it is likely disabled by default. I believe that writing to the drive could cause you trouble. Rappermas -- is ntfs-3g safe to use then?
[03:13] <cynikal> Pelo: yeah I understand. I was afraid of possibly corrupting my windows install, but my brother convinced me to use it and I'm glad I took the chance
[03:13] <TIger_IT> Pelo: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29818/
[03:13] <abovett> Poseidon: It'kll run on them - or do you want one with it preinstalled?
[03:13] <TIger_IT> sethk: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29818/
[03:13] <Rappermas> think: back when I had windows XP, it worked fine
[03:13] <TIger_IT> Some explanations are in spanish........but they are no too much!
[03:14] <Poseidon> abovett,sure
[03:14] <TaPiOn> Hi
[03:14] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> thanks cynikal , thinkl and Rappermas :)
[03:14] <sethk> TIger_IT, it's telling you the drive only goes to udma6, which is common.  In fact, many go only to 5
[03:14] <AlanHaggai|Sleep> will try it
[03:14] <Rappermas> anyway, the author claims that it fully works, just slower
[03:14] <baxter_kylie> Pelo: change executable files to 666 for shared code.
[03:14] <cynikal> course :)
[03:14] <TIger_IT> sethk: Im in udma2!!!!
[03:14] <TaPiOn> I search prog who can tell video's length ? pls
[03:14] <TIger_IT> sethk: Ive tried hdparm  -X udma7 /dev/hda
[03:14] <abovett> Poseidon: I think a few people are selling them but not sure who.
[03:14] <TIger_IT> sethk: and nothing!!
[03:14] <TaPiOn> I search prog who can tell me video's length ? pls
[03:14] <cynikal> Rappermas: and I agree with the author. I've been using it for a long time without problems, just wish they would work on the performance now heh
[03:15] <sethk> TIger_IT, the drive doesn't support 7, so nothing is what is supposed to happen
[03:15] <Yancho> whats the command to check the cpu usage pls ?
[03:15] <baxter_kylie> Pelo: Anytime I chmod (or even gksudo nautilis) the changes I make are accepted but not applied.
[03:15] <abovett> Poseidon: works well on most laptops I've tried though.
[03:15] <sethk> TIger_IT, the drive only supports 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
[03:15] <sethk> TIger_IT, so use 6
[03:15] <Rappermas> cynikal: lol, true, i think they just decided it's good enough
[03:15] <TIger_IT> sethk:  its supported!!!
[03:15] <Poseidon> abovett,i have a version   is it too old?
[03:15] <Pelo> TIger_IT,  I don'T know how to solve your issue,  and no one else answered you so I suggested the forum
[03:15] <sethk> TIger_IT, the drive is telling the program it does not.  don't you see the list of supported DMA modes?
[03:15] <abovett> Poseidon: what is it?
[03:16] <Pelo> baxter_kylie,  I don'T know, I'm a noob at this myself
[03:16] <Poseidon> abovett ,v5.04
[03:16] <micah_c> there we go...

[03:16] <DanSchnell> How do i get the X log on the paste site?
[03:16] <abovett> Poseidon: It will but why not get a more up to date version - it'll work better.
[03:16] <TIger_IT> sethk:  DMA modes:  mdma0 mdma1 mdma2
[03:16] <Pelo> baxter_kylie,  you might find an answer here http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php
[03:16] <ke-> MDMA :D
[03:17] <grndslm> cynikal, http://pastebin.ca/233663
[03:17] <Poseidon> abovett,i think so
[03:17] <TIger_IT> sethk:  BUT about UDMA modes: udma0 udma1 *udma2 udma3 udma4 udma5 udma6
[03:17] <sethk> TIger_IT, I was looking at UDMA, but it is only showing you 0, 1, and 2 in MDMA, so what's your point?
[03:17] <grndslm> trying to copy my friend's music to my computer...if that matters
[03:17] <sethk> TIger_IT, yes, indeed, 6.  NOT 7.  6.  6.   not 7.   6.  got it?
[03:17] <TaPiOn> PLS
[03:17] <TIger_IT> sethk:  my point is......... WHY udma2 if I can use udma6 ...
[03:17] <TaPiOn> I search prog who can tell me video's length ? pls
[03:18] <TIger_IT> sethk:  ok...
[03:18] <sethk> TIger_IT, you told me you tried 7.  7 doesn't exist, so nothing happens.
[03:18] <sethk> TIger_IT, it isn't going to say, hey, I don't have 7, here's 6.
[03:18] <Rappermas> ok, i have a ridiculously easy question that i'm still wondering about--in beryl, how do i set a double click on the title bar to maximize the window instead of shading it?

[03:22] <TIger_IT> sethk: Got U the idea, now ?
[03:22] <dabaR> DanSchnell: well you need to copy and paste to get the file to the pastebin.
[03:22] <sethk> TIger_IT, you mean why does it default to udma2?  probably because of a BIOS setting.  It may be a driver issue.  It may be the S.M.A.R.T. settings
[03:22] <abovett> Poseidon: do you mean you want to install from an image on the hard disk, or install _to_ the hard disk?

[03:22] <TIger_IT> sethk: thanks

[03:23] <dabaR> DanSchnell: visit paste.ubuntu-nl.org to get an idea of what to do

[03:24] <thinkl> sethk: Well, the more I research, the more it looks bad for me. It looks like frontpage uses some kind of special proprietary extensions of its own which are different from the standard ftp/sftp/webdav toolkit...
[03:24] <AlanHaggai> cycom : yes

[03:26] <nonono> TIger_IT: sudo doesnt do anything. It seems dead.
[03:26] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: Ok type "sudo nano /etc/fstab"
[03:26] <abovett> Poseidon: You need to burn the ISO to CD as a disk image - can't remember if XP can do that itself or if you need to use something like Nero. _Don't_ just burn the ISO file to the CD as a file!
[03:27] <henna> see you all

[03:27] <henna> maybe till later on
[03:27] <abovett> Poseidon: Do you have Nero or anything like that?
[03:27] <micahcowan> nonono, I took your comment to mean that you do have *a* user that can use sudo?

[03:27] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: After that you have to type "sudo umount -a" and then "sudo mount -a"
[03:27] <abk> merkidemis: I'm not sure fglrx supports older Radeons. I have a Radeon Mobility in my Thinkpad and it's not supported either. ATI is nasty
[03:27] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: to remount it
[03:28] <grndslm> cynikal...but, i define it in the smb.conf file?  and tell that to windows where?  in the username field?
[03:28] <abovett> Poseidon: VM? You mean you are running a virtual machine?
[03:28] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : please help me change the fstab
[03:28] <henna> love you dearest lovely dad
[03:28] <cynikal> grndslm: In the smb file it should say "workgroup = WORKGROUP", just change that to say MSHOME instead
[03:28] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : I will paste it and send you the link
[03:28] <nonono> TIger_IT: mc is a program I have. But sudo doesn neither sais it not found nor opens it the program
[03:28] <cynikal> grndslm: you don't do anything on the windows machine, it should work just like any regular folder
[03:28] <abk> nobody has any ideas on how to edit themes without gnome-theme-manager?
[03:28] <Poseidon> abovett, no I dont want to run it  ,it is too slow
[03:28] <nonono> TIger_IT: 'sudo <any-cmd>' does nothing
[03:29] <nonono> TIger_IT: ,'sudo ls' - no output
[03:29] <TIger_IT> nonono: TRY gksudo or kdesu
[03:29] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29820/
[03:29] <TIger_IT> nonono: U MUST be in a console......... U know ?
[03:29] <DanSchnell> can somebody please help me?
[03:30] <Pelo> DanSchnell,  what is your issue ?
[03:30] <Poseidon> abovett,so i have to burn it to a cd with NERO right?
[03:30] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: umm wow, are....are you sure thats right?
[03:30] <abovett> Poseidon: So do you have any way to burn the ISO to CD as an image? If you like I can check if XP can do it itself but it will take a few minutes - no XP boxes ruinning at the moment.
[03:31] <grndslm> cynikal...it's still definitely asking for at least something in the user field when i type in 192.168.1.101 in explorer's address bar
[03:31] <DanSchnell> Pelo, I have just reconfigured xserver-xorg, but now how do i load ubuntu from LiveCD from console?
[03:31] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: you have like 9 ntfs partitions lol
[03:31] <sethk> Poseidon, well, with nero or a similar program, there are several including at least one free one.
[03:31] <sith-lord> Hello
[03:31] <AlanHaggai> yes cynikal :)
[03:31] <merkidemis> abk: its not older, I bought this about 6 months ago (well, kinda old then I guess :)
[03:31] <nonono> TIger_IT: I am in the konsole all the time.  gksudo gave me something different: I typed 'gksudo ls', gave me: "username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported."
[03:31] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : 280 GB in total
[03:31] <dabaR> sethk: free as in pudding or free as in freedom?
[03:31] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: For every line, after where it says /media/sda#, change ntfs to ntfs-3g
[03:31] <Pelo> DanSchnell,  , sorry I don't know ,  I am not even sure I understand what you are trying to acheive
[03:31] <hiffy> sethk: Turns out my "f-lock" was out. Everything is fine in that regard. If you actually remembered my problem, thats another story.
[03:31] <sethk> dabaR, both, I imagine  :)
[03:31] <cynikal> grndslm: you have to restart samba for the changes to take effect
[03:31] <hiffy> Now, howeever, my sound has stopped working.
[03:31] <firebird619> abovett: I am running XP right now and to my knowledge it cannot burn ISOs itself. I have seen programs on the Internet to add that functionality though.
[03:32] <sith-lord> unsure
[03:32] <sethk> hiffy, yes, I remember, at least a bit.
[03:32] <TIger_IT> nonono:  ?
[03:32] <grndslm> cynikal...ahh, gracias
[03:32] <cynikal> grndslm: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
[03:32] <yungknight> does anyone know what i would be getting "SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such file or directory" after doing ifconfig eth1 (iwconfig shows eth1 as my wireless connection)?
[03:32] <Poseidon> abovett,just copy a .iso. is it OK?
[03:32] <AlanHaggai> ok cynikal
[03:32] <abk> merkidemis: so you've tried setting "fglrx" as your driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf? (assuming you've installed fglrx)
[03:32] <DanSchnell> Pelo, I have reconfigured my setters for monitor and driver so i can see the desktop.  This is my problem: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290877
[03:32] <kitche> yungknight did you do sudo ifconfig eth1 up before you did ifconfig eth1?
[03:33] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : I get a device is busy error while trying to unmount
[03:33] <meatwad64> is there a decent cd ripper on linux at all?
[03:33] <yungknight> kitche: yea
[03:33] <merkidemis> abk: nope, that does not appear to have helped
[03:33] <nonono> TIger_IT: Any suggestions?
[03:33] <abovett> Poseidon: No - don't just copy the ISO to CD - that won't work.
[03:33] <TIger_IT> nonono:  no no
[03:33] <nonono> TIger_IT: gksudo gave me something different: I typed 'gksudo ls', gave me: "username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported."
[03:33] <grndslm> cynikal...still a nova
[03:33] <meatwad64> juicer is nice but seems to be ogg only which my iPod doesn't like
[03:33] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: oh no thats fine. I told you to unmount all of your mount points, and you cant unmount the root file system you are using
[03:33] <hiffy> oy vey
[03:33] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: so just remount them and you should have write access
[03:33] <hiffy> nm. Wow. Today is not my day
[03:33] <todesengel> i just installed ubuntu, and i'm having a ltitle bit of a hard time grasping how to configure network connections
[03:33] <AlanHaggai> cynikal :I see
[03:33] <cynikal> grndslm: it still asks for a username/pass?
[03:34] <abovett> Poseidon: you must burn it as a disk image. Nero can definitely do it - I'll cyheck if XP can do it without nero - hold on...
[03:34] <grndslm> oh yea
[03:34] <AlanHaggai> cynikal : How to remount them?
[03:34] <abk> merkidemis: I'm not sure then :[ I know quick fixes, but I'm a mac tech :p
[03:34] <TIger_IT> nonono:  if you need something very important......... reboot...and entry as SINGLE USER MODE
[03:34] <merkidemis> abk: It was working great in Dapper, but after I updated to Edgy its all crap
[03:34] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: sudo mount -a
[03:34] <todesengel> i'm connected to the net via my neighbors open wireless, which ubuntu picked up and configured
[03:34] <TIger_IT> nonono:  U WILL BE ROOT ALL THE TIME
[03:34] <Poseidon> abovett,thank you very much
[03:34] <grndslm> cynikal...maybe i should just try restarting both 'puters?
[03:34] <cynikal> grndslm: Hmm, are you sure your friend's workgroup is called MSHOME?
[03:34] <todesengel> but, when i go to 'networking', it says that my wireless connection isn't configured or enabled
[03:35] <grndslm> cynikal...i don't have any clue about networking in ms
[03:35] <azureal> is there a useful utility for discovering my soundcard?  cli discover does not seem to work...
[03:35] <grndslm> or linux for that matter
[03:35] <sethk> voraistos, does nonononot
[03:35] <DanSchnell> What is the command for gdm restart?
[03:35] <AlanHaggai> yes cynikal. It is working. Thank you very much :)
[03:35] <Pelo> DanSchnell, ,  sorry, I can'T help
[03:35] <merkidemis> abk: I've been pouring over the forums, of course, trying everything, but obviously they haven't been helpful
[03:35] <cynikal> AlanHaggai: Np :)
[03:35] <merkidemis> Dan: sudo shutdown -r now
[03:35] <cynikal> DanSchnell: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[03:35] <aw420> hi i have just installed 64bit edgy today and i followed the instructions to get automatix2 and that went fine my only problem is that im still unable to play windows media 9 files
[03:36] <cynikal> grndslm: Do you have access to your friend's machine right now? Or can you tell him to change something?
[03:36] <grndslm> cynikal...yes, he's 2 rooms over
[03:36] <DanSchnell> cynikal, why does Starting GNOME display manager fail for me?
[03:36] <cynikal> DanSchnell: I'm not sure
[03:36] <Dheeraj_k> window media 9 file?
[03:36] <cynikal> grndslm: lol one sec I will reboot and see. I havent used windows in a while so I cant remember it off the top of my head
[03:37] <m4jqp> has anyone ever had the problem that when you install the nvidia beta drivers you can't see text?
[03:37] <DanSchnell> This is ridiculous.  I've been trying to find out the problem for the last week and nobody has ANY idea at all!  I've asked here and on the forums and none of the solutions work.
[03:37] <todesengel> why does networking say that my wireless connection isn't configured or enabled?
[03:37] <abk> merkidemis: do you NEED edgy for anything? my rule of thumb is "don't fix what ain't broke"
[03:37] <grndslm> DanSchnell....reinstall from scratch?
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp Xgl ?
[03:38] <merkidemis> abk: probably not, though it seems a little late now
[03:38] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, no the nvidia beta drivers
[03:38] <LjL> !automatix | aw420
[03:38] <ubotu> aw420: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[03:38] <grndslm> DanSchnell, if your home dir. is on a separate partition...it shouldn't be a huge problem...but YMMV
[03:38] <DanSchnell> grndslm, Its not installion, I'm trying to get the LiveCD to load.  This is my problem: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290877
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp I only had that trouble with Xgl/compiz, xterm worked but urxvt didn't
[03:38] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, how'd you fix that?
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> couldn't figure out the colors properly
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> I switched to Beryl and it went away
[03:39] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, you don't need xgl to use beryl/compiz with the beta drivers
[03:39] <abovett> Poseidon: XP can't burn ISO images by itself, but I think there are some free programs which will do it if you don't have Nero or anything like that. Can't vouch for them though. It _might_ be possible to install from an ISO image on the hard disk but I'm not exactly sure how and I suspect it would be a little complex.
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> really, didn't realize that
[03:39] <m4jqp> yup :)
[03:39] <m4jqp> i found it way easier to set up
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> ah beta drivers
[03:39] <m4jqp> but my friend can't see text
[03:39] <merkidemis> brb, I am going to move to the library
[03:39] <m4jqp> and fails at irc
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> yeah I'm on the plain nivia-glx drivers
[03:39] <kitche> Poseidon: DeepBurner Free is good
[03:39] <m4jqp> and i donno what is problem is
[03:40] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp have him try 'xterm', if that works, start rxvt from that term and see what the error is if any
[03:40] <TIger_IT>  WHY if I can use up to udma6 .......... Ive actived udma2 !!!
[03:40] <abovett> kitche: Thanks for the recommendation - I've not got experience with any of these programs.
[03:40] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, what is xterm?
[03:40] <firebird619> abovett: http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm has a download to add ISO burning as a native function to Windows XP, 2003, etc.
[03:40] <grndslm> DanSchnell...only thing i could suggest is dropping into a terminal and typing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and make sure framebuffer isn't enabled...if that doesn't help, then i dunno
[03:40] <p00ch3d> i've got a Dell Latitude D820 with the Intel PRO/wireless 3945ABG wifi card and wondering if anyone has some comprehensive how-to's for making Dapper happy with the wifi card with WPA?
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp a terminal window app
[03:41] <m4jqp> so it's a command?
[03:41] <m4jqp> (i use gentoo)
[03:41] <m4jqp> never used ubuntu
[03:41] <m4jqp> lol
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> yes, opens a window
[03:41] <cynical> grndslm: tell your friend to right click on my computer and go to properties
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> xterm is just X, you probably have it
[03:41] <sethk> m4jqp, gentoo and ubuntu have precisely the same commands, including xterm
[03:41] <m4jqp> ahh
[03:41] <m4jqp> never used it
[03:42] <cynical> grndslm: then click on the next tab to the right, he will find his computer's name and his workgroup's name listed there
[03:42] <Poseidon> abovett,thanks, i can download Nero later i will try to burn it
[03:42] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, should the beta driers be instaled when he does this? because he can't see any text with them installed
[03:42] <VanessaE> good evening
[03:42] <abovett> Poseidon: OK - good luck.
[03:43] <DanSchnell> grndslm, it is not enabled...
[03:43] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp not sure what causes it but there is some weird color mapping thing that happens
[03:43] <abovett> firebird619: Thanks - useful to know.
[03:43] <Kingsqueak> I just sort of figured a way around it, not the real cause
[03:43] <firebird619> abovett: np
[03:44] <kitche> m4jqp: you probably don't have xterm unless you installed it
[03:44] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, http://pastebin.ca/233690 thats what he gets
[03:44] <DanSchnell> Anyone: when i use "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" it says Starting GNOME Display Manager fails, can anyone help me?
[03:44] <m4jqp> kitche, ahh
[03:44] <duarte> i've been having problems with the network manager applet on edy... can anyone help me?
[03:44] <abk> duarte: I have basic knowledge, what's up?
[03:44] <kitche> m4jqp: since it's seperate in xorg-modular
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp that seems like he's trying to run xterm as a different user than the X session is run as
[03:45] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, he got that error as root
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> is X session running as root?
[03:46] <grndslm> cynical, i don't think he had any workgroups setup...i tried to enable one, which was defaulted to MSHOME...and i have to restart, so we'll see how that goes
[03:46] <m4jqp> king
[03:46] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, probably not
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> tell him to run it as the user he's logged in as
[03:47] <cynical> grndslm: ah you ran the network setup wizard?
[03:47] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, seem's he's here >> francois
[03:47] <duarte> I cannot choose wireless networks using the applet on the notification area
[03:48] <francois> Kingsqueak, hey, i'm sorta stuck :S
[03:48] <grndslm> cynical, yup...i figured it would have been enabled by default, but i guessed wrong
[03:48] <cynical> grndslm: I as well. Does it seem to work now?
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> francois as the user X is logged in as, run 'xterm' see if you can see the fonts
[03:49] <grndslm> cynical...still waiting on the reboot
[03:49] <abk> duarte, try running "sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces". what's in there?
[03:49] <m4jqp> francois, probably meaning you need the beta drivers instaled
[03:49] <m4jqp> then run it
[03:49] <Clarrisa> how do I find out what version of PHP i have installed?
[03:49] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok so run on the beta drivers, and then run xterm ? '
=== Shadow_mil2 is now known as Shadow_mil
[03:50] <hangfire> php -v
[03:50] <francois> Kingsqueak, because right now i get this error http://pastebin.ca/233710
[03:50] <m4jqp> Clarrisa, php --version
[03:50] <Kingsqueak> francois that error is because you are running that command as a different user than X is running as
[03:51] <sethk> francois, as the user who started x, do:    xhost +
[03:51] <sethk> francois, that allows all hosts and users to connect to your X display
[03:51] <francois> ah
[03:51] <sethk> francois, turn it back off (if you need to) with    xhost -
[03:51] <grndslm> cynical...now it at least shows my comuter under "view workgroups" or whatever...but it's STILL asking for the user/pass
[03:51] <sethk> francois, that's xhost space the-plus-sign
[03:51] <sethk> francois, xhost +
=== voosuz_ is now known as voosuz
[03:51] <francois> ok
[03:51] <francois> so run that now ?
[03:52] <sethk> francois, if you want to connect as the other user, yes
[03:52] <cynical> grndslm: grr this is strange, reboot your computer just in case
[03:52] <grndslm> aight...bbiaf
[03:52] <jramsey> i added a network hp laserjet 1200 printer hosted on windows as a windows smb printer, basically used suggested defaults (driver, etc.) but prints do nothing
[03:52] <Clarrisa> m4jqp when I type php --version, bash says php: command not found.... I must not be in the right folder?
[03:53] <francois> sethk, ok done that, now what do i do ? it just says disabled access control
[03:53] <m4jqp> Clarrisa, install php then
[03:53] <sethk> francois, right.  so now, the other command that gave you the error you posted should work
[03:53] <MetaMorfoziS> !bootup
[03:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bootup - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:53] <Clarrisa> m4jqp, it's installed.... it's a LAMP server
[03:54] <butterflywifemay> hello everyone how are you?
[03:54] <francois> ok
[03:54] <sethk> MetaMorfoziS, did you mean bootp?
[03:54] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok now i have to reboot with the new drivers running ? and then run xterm ?
[03:54] <MetaMorfoziS> no,  i find some bootup sppeedup trick
[03:55] <delta____> Hey guys! I use Ubuntu Dapper's OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 and cannot seem to get hypenation for "English (GB)" and "English (US)". Also, apt-cache only lists openoffice.org-hyphenation-de, openoffice.org-hyphenation-hr and openoffice.org-hyphenation-hu. Am I doing something wrong, or is there simply no support?
[03:55] <alisha> is there anyway to enable wpa in wireless networking?
[03:55] <DanSchnell> Question...Is it possible to run LiveCD on an nVidia driver?
[03:56] <delta____> alisha: Depends on your driver, I'd say. I use ndiswrapper and got everything running smoothly on Dapper
[03:56] <alisha> hmmm
[03:56] <alisha> it recognized the adapter
[03:56] <alisha> but only allows wep
[03:56] <brush01uk> Good night ALL  from the U K   - Take care       byeeeeee
[03:56] <alisha> i don't see any other choice
[03:57] <delta____> alisha: Do you have the supplicant daemon for WPA installed?
[03:57] <Juan> is there any way to disable the lock screen?
[03:57] <alisha> no don't know what that is but the adapter is in networking
[03:57] <Juan> like, just use the login screen instead?
[03:58] <delta____> alisha: Ah, I see, you're trying to install things GUI-only. I am sorry, but only got it working with editing config files manually
[03:58] <alisha> oh dear is there a guide somewhere?
[03:59] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok now i have to reboot with the new drivers running ? and then run xterm ?
[03:59] <delta____> alisha: There's lots of guides for Debian. Pick one, have fun
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> alisha what linux are you running...which release?
[03:59] <grndslm> cynical...still doesn't help...i think the problem is with windows.  i don't think it allows you to connect until there is at least one character in the username field.  if there's nothing there, the "ok" button isn't even available
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> francois you are mixing up the issues
[03:59] <alisha> dapper
[03:59] <dudesmithy> Hello everyone....I have a quick (hopefully) installation question
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> xterm should have worked for you already
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> alisha apt-get install network-manager and gnome-network-manager
[04:00] <DanSchnell> Can someone answer my question?
[04:00] <alisha> ok
[04:00] <francois> Kingsqueak, it did and i could see the font no problem
[04:00] <grndslm> dudesmithy, just ask the question
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> alisha after that, start up  nm-applet
[04:00] <francois> Kingsqueak, but i'm just running the generic "nv" drivers right now
[04:00] <cynical> grndslm: I dont understand what could possibly be wrong though. The windows machines in my house don't require authentication to connect to me, and if you are using my config file it wouldnt make sense for it to not work
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> francois o.k. so you have the issue I had, the only way I fixed it was to run Beryl instead of compiz
[04:01] <rga> how is HD Sata in Ubuntu? sda? no hda?
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> francois I don't have much else to tell you other than it was a color mapping issue I never fixed
[04:01] <grndslm> cynical...i totally agree...non-sensical
[04:01] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, it's not a beryl or compiz problem yet, it's a drivers and config file problem
[04:01] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) with running in Raid 1.  I have a  3rd Hard Drive that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:01] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok weird, but thanks for the help, i'm trying to get the new beta drivers to work, and when i use them it screwed up all my fonts, so its weird,
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp the window manager doesn't like his drivers, it's color mapping
[04:01] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, can't use beryl if you can't read any text on anything
[04:01] <baxter_kylie> Hi. How do I enable table completion on an additional user?
[04:01] <rga> how is HD Sata in Ubuntu? sda? no hda?
[04:01] <cynical> grndslm: I'm sorry I couldn't help you :(
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp just starting beryl-manager fixed me right up
[04:02] <grndslm> cynical, it's all good...maybe i'll just start over again and hope it works
[04:02] <m4jqp> lol his kwin wont show text
[04:02] <DanSchnell> Somebody? Anyone?
[04:02] <baxter_kylie> rga: nvidia sata in amd64 is broken.
[04:02] <grndslm> cynical, quick question, tho....what do the ;'s at the beginning of the lines mean?
[04:02] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, his kwin wont show text
[04:02] <Xaser> hey guys, Just wondering if someone could try to fix my problem, I have 2 ubuntu boxes that are having troubles connecting to the net. My Windows machine works fine. the Network works fine between them all, and one can get to some websites but not others..  any ideas guys?
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp but you can still type in it
[04:02] <cynical> grndslm: It means the lines are commented out
[04:03] <cynical> grndslm: so samba ignores them
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp I typed 'beryl-manager' in a blacked out term
[04:03] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, lol
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> poof it fixed it
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> otherwise if he disables glx I bet it goes away
[04:03] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, does your metacity/kwin have color ? or is beryl the only tihng that works?
[04:03] <jordan> DanSchnell: Could you refrase the question, you can run the liveCD with an nVidea card.
[04:04] <DanSchnell> I am not able too
[04:04] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok i'll try disabling glx and then beryl-manager
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> m4jqp I haven't tried the others
[04:04] <grndslm> cynical...just wondering why it uses two different characters for commenting out lines
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> francois try beryl-manager first
[04:04] <babo> I can't even hear system sounds ... :-(
[04:04] <grndslm> i guess just for looks
[04:04] <m4jqp> Kingsqueak, lol
[04:04] <jordan> DanSchnell: What happes when you try?
[04:04] <babo> can anyone help ?
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> francois if that doesn't fix you, then disable glx
[04:04] <DanSchnell> jordan: this is what happens: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290877
[04:04] <francois> Kingsqueak, ok, thanks a lot for the help
[04:04] <Juan> is there any way to disable the lock screen? like, just use the login screen instead?
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> francois you should be able to just fire up beryl-manager right now in the running session
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> francois type it into the xterm you opened
[04:05] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:05] <francois> Kingsqueak, yeah but i gotta reinstall it first
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> heh k
[04:05] <jordan> DanSchnell: Can you get to a tty?
[04:05] <DanSchnell> jordan, sorry i don't understand what you mean
[04:06] <rga> how it is Hard Disk SATA in the Ubuntu?
[04:06] <abovett> juan: do you mean you want it to automatically log you out? That would close all your apps.
[04:06] <Juan> n ope
[04:06] <rga> how it is Hard Disk SATA in the Ubuntu? /hda?
[04:06] <Juan> i have  more than 1 user
[04:06] <Juan> and i just wanna switch
[04:06] <Juan> without login out
[04:06] <jordan> DanSchnell: You can get to a terminal by pressing alt + F2, and it doesn't require graphics drivers to see it.
[04:07] <abovett> juan: oh I see - not sure, sorry.
[04:07] <Juan> but when i re login to an open session, i get prompted for  password twice
[04:07] <DanSchnell> jordan, Ok.  Then what do I do?  I've tried changing my graphics driver and everything.
[04:07] <Juan> on the login screen and the lock screen
[04:07] <Xaser> Hey Guys, I have 2 ubuntu boxes that are having trouble connecting to the net. I also ahve a win box the works fine. All connect to each other fine. I can get to some websites but not others. Any ideas PLS?
[04:08] <jason> Good evening
[04:08] <DanSchnell> Jordan, btw, i've tried sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart after reconfiguring and it says GNOME display manager fails...
[04:08] <jason> I have two problems with my edgy upgrade.
[04:08] <voraistos> Xaser it must be some proxy related problem
[04:09] <jordan> DanSchnell: You can try installing nvidia's proprietary drivers, I can help you with that.
[04:09] <jason> First, Disks has disappeared off my System: Admin menu.
[04:09] <DanSchnell> Jordan, do I need to actually have Ubuntu installed, or can I do that from LiveCD?
[04:09] <Xaser> voraistos: I have no proxy setup
[04:09] <abovett> Xaser: might be a DNS issue. Have you tried using the IP addresses of some of the sites you can't get to - see if you can reach them via address when you can't via name?
[04:10] <jason> Second: update-manager shows two greyed-out packages listed as distribution upgrades but I can't update them.
[04:10] <abovett> Xaser: What happens if you try to ping the site syou can't reach?
[04:10] <jordan> DanSchnell: If you have enough RAM on the machine you can do it on the LiveCD
[04:10] <DanSchnell> Jordan, I do.
[04:10] <Xaser> abovett: I cant ping them either
[04:11] <abovett> Xaser: what is the error message? CAn you ping them by address rather than name?
[04:11] <voraistos> Xaser what is your actual network config ?
[04:11] <jordan> DanSchnell: Are you booted into the liveCD now?
[04:11] <todesengel> how do i get WMV files working?
[04:11] <jordan> !codecs
[04:11] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:11] <Xaser> abovett: sry I can ping them by www.google.com  so to me that not  a DNS prob
[04:12] <todesengel> installing ffmpeg plugin doesn't work
[04:12] <todesengel> do i need to go find another codec?
[04:12] <DanSchnell> Jordan, No.  I don't really have time tonight to do it.  Will you be here tomorrow?
[04:12] <voraistos> Xaser that doesnt mean anything.
[04:12] <reiki> WOOT! I got World of Warcraft running in Wine on Edgy! I am so happy... hehehe
[04:12] <voraistos> Xaser it could be DNS related anyway
[04:12] <delta____> reiki: Grats :)
[04:12] <Xaser> voraistos: what can you suggest then?
[04:12] <jordan> DanSchnell: Possibly, around what time?
[04:12] <abovett> Xaser: what do you mean? Give an example of a site you _can't_ reach
[04:13] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:13] <voraistos> Xaser i would like to know what is your LAN config first
[04:13] <delta____> Is one of you guys running Dapper's OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 and has hyphenation support for English text? I haven't...
[04:13] <Xaser> abovett: I cant access www.google.com via firefox, but can ping it
[04:13] <DanSchnell> Jordan, Anytime after 5 p.m. CST
[04:13] <Xaser> voraistos: what do you details do you want?
[04:13] <voraistos> Xaser router config, etc ...
[04:14] <jason> sorry to barge in
[04:14] <grndslm> ok..anybody here besides cynikal know how to use connect a windows computer to samba?
[04:14] <kitche> grndslm: yes you will do //<ip of computer with samba>/share
[04:14] <erick> hi all, how can i install apache tomcat in ubuntu Edgy?
[04:14] <Xaser> voraistos: ip 192.168.1.211, mask 255.255.255.0
[04:15] <burnick> why does the prism2_pci module detects my wireless prism 2 built card
[04:15] <jordan> DanSchnell: Probably, so you don't clog up the main channel, try asking for me in #ubuntu-bots every once in a while since I don't know when / if I will be on.
[04:15] <abovett> Xaser: what happens if you put the address of a site you can't reach by name into the browser?
[04:15] <voraistos> windows computers connecting to each others have always been a problem for some reason
[04:15] <burnick> wired
[04:15] <grndslm> kitche, yea...but it asks for user/pass pass verification and won't allow me to click "ok" until i enter at least one character
[04:15] <voraistos> Xaser, gateway ?
[04:15] <jason> Where has the Disks utility gone in edgy?
[04:15] <kitche> grndslm: yeah it will you need a samba user there is a guest setup also for samba
[04:15] <abovett> grbdslm: what's the problem? I've got some windows and samba boxes talking OK?
[04:15] <jordan> jason: It isn't maintained anymore AFIK
[04:16] <Xaser> voraistos: 192.168.1.1
[04:16] <jason> What does one use instead?
[04:16] <jordan> jason: Possibly gparted?
[04:16] <Xaser> abovett: no good, stil times out
[04:16] <voraistos> Xaser use DNS server as 192.168.1.1
[04:17] <jason> I've got an external USB disk that doesn't get autodetected.
[04:17] <Xaser> voraistos: yes thats right for the DNS
[04:17] <jordan> jason: Or I think you can still install the old disks manager
[04:17] <DanSchnell> jordan, how do i ask for someone in #ubuntu-bots
[04:17] <grndslm> kitche, so...what do i do?
[04:17] <jordan> DanSchnell: Just post asking if the guy you talked to yesterday is here every few minutes.
[04:18] <cynical> grndslm: heres a good resource, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
[04:18] <voraistos> Xaser. what does proxy config say ?
[04:18] <burnick> why does the prism2_pci module detects my wireless prism 2 built card as wired connection?
[04:18] <bubba_jones> anyone familiar with ndiswrapper?
[04:18] <voraistos> Xaser, system preferences. advanced config
[04:18] <DanSchnell> jordan, like how...?
[04:18] <kitche> grndslm: setup a samba user or use a guest account for samba
[04:19] <Xaser> voraistos:in the browser? Direct connection
[04:19] <voraistos> nope. in system menu
[04:19] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:19] <grndslm> kitche...so, will uncommenting the "guest account = guest" line be good enough?
[04:20] <kitche> grndslm: yea probably you will probably have to setup a password for it but guest doesn't have write permissions
[04:20] <Xaser> voraistos: same there tooo
[04:20] <voraistos> in the advanced tab
[04:20] <voraistos> Xaser, what does it say ?
[04:20] <Xaser> localhost   127.0.0/8    *.local
[04:21] <voraistos> daMN
[04:21] <Xaser> sry it was 127.0.0.0/8
[04:21] <Xaser> LOL any more ideas?
[04:21] <voraistos> understood that ;)
[04:21] <Xaser> its really annoying me..
[04:21] <voraistos> and your win box can access it ? yeah, strange
[04:21] <erick> hi all, how can i install apache tomcat in ubuntu Edgy?
=== matt_ is now known as Jambo
[04:21] <spiderworm> hello all, can anyone tell me, does edgy use udev ?
[04:21] <Xaser> was the same when I had fedora core 5 on there too
[04:22] <Xaser> yeah win box work 100%
[04:22] <voraistos> Xaser, you dont have wifi ?
=== Jambo is now known as chimpsky
[04:22] <Xaser> I do, but not on the linux boxes
[04:22] <aw420> hi i have just installed 64bit edgy today and i followed the instructions to get automatix2 and that went fine my only problem is that im still unable to play windows media 9 files
[04:22] <voraistos> Xaser. what is your ISP ?
[04:23] <Xaser> Chariot
[04:23] <bimberi> spiderworm: yes
[04:23] <AlanHaggai> cynical : I have a question
[04:23] <Xaser> hahahah
[04:23] <spiderworm> bimberi: did dapper use udev as well or did it start with edgy?
[04:23] <cynical> AlanHaggai: shoot
[04:24] <voraistos> Xaser, what kind of network adapter do u have? brand, etc..
[04:24] <bimberi> aw420: 64bit + codes = no go (afaik)
[04:24] <bimberi> spiderworm: yes, dapper does too
[04:24] <AlanHaggai> cynical : I have done everything as you have said and now I can write to the NTFS partitions. The problem is with the icons.
[04:24] <bimberi> aw420: *codecs
[04:25] <jason> Could my external drive not be showing because it's HFS+?
[04:25] <spiderworm> bimberi: can you think of any change that would cause pptp connections to fail from edgy, connections that worked fine in dapper?
[04:25] <voraistos> Xaser, what is your ifconfig ? you can paste it in #voraistos instead of pastebin
[04:25] <AlanHaggai> cynical : In the desktop, only sda5 has been given the icon of a hard disk. All the others are having the icons of folders. How to change them too?
[04:25] <aw420> bimberi: what about 32 bit mplayer and and 32bitcodecs
[04:25] <bimberi> spiderworm: no sorry
[04:25] <spiderworm> np, thanks for your help
[04:25] <erick> somebody help me, how can i install apache tomcat in ubuntu Edgy?
[04:25] <bimberi> yw :)
[04:25] <Xaser> one has Dlink 1gig, and on board 1gig, other has a DEC 10/100
=== trophy is now known as thefoe
[04:26] <jason> Is it not in the repos?
[04:26] <bimberi> aw420: idk, i've only used 32bit
[04:26] <Xaser> both auto dectect no probs and network to each other fine
[04:26] <ehj20> Xaser: what does http://66.102.9.147/ in firefox do?
[04:26] <voraistos> Xaser: what about ifconfig ?
[04:26] <cynical> AlanHaggai: Hmm I cant answer that. They should all have shown up with hard disk icons. Sorry :\
[04:26] <Xaser> gets google  :S
[04:27] <AlanHaggai> cynical : no problem :)
[04:27] <cynical> aw420: are you talking about mplayer/codecs on 64-bit?
[04:27] <highneko> I'm looking for a computer that'll work good with a ubuntu 64-bit installation cd. After reading alittle I think AMD Athlon would be good. How's this computer? http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=0926INGFS10079969&catid=20217&logon=&langid=EN
[04:27] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:27] <ehj20> perhaps firefox has a DNS cache
[04:27] <voraistos> Xaser: seems like a DNS problem. definely
[04:27] <lostboyz> i have a question i am trying to upgrade ubuntu but when i get to configurign in apt it says it is not possible
[04:27] <aw420> cynical: yes
[04:28] <Xaser> but I tried the aussie google addy and no go
[04:28] <grndslm> kitche...so, could you explain step by step how i can possibly setup a samba user to share files between a windows and ubuntu boxes?
[04:28] <abovett> Xaser: obvious question - you have tried closing and restarting Fireox I assume?
[04:28] <Xaser> 66.249.89.99
[04:28] <cynical> aw420: you can compile the latest mplayer, it includes native support for the wmv codec. http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html
[04:28] <Xaser> abovett: yes  hehehe
[04:28] <lostboyz> for xubuntu'desktop acpid acpi'support
[04:28] <bruenig> grndslm, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605
[04:28] <voraistos> abovett he said he had the same problem on a different distro
[04:28] <abovett> Xaser: might be worth running a packet sniffer and seeing what's going on.
[04:29] <bimberi> erick: edgy has tomcat5 and tomcat5.5 packages (in universe) - try searching via http://packages.ubuntu.com
[04:29] <abovett> voraistos: sorry - have been away from the conversation for a while. My bad.
[04:29] <Xaser> I do thank you both for trying
[04:30] <voraistos> abovett: i am not sure this guy can run a packet sniffer
[04:30] <grndslm> bruenig...thanks, will look into it
[04:30] <ehj20> Xaser: have you tried another browser?
[04:30] <__mikem> can someone here help me with a thunderbird problem?
[04:30] <voraistos> Xaser: yeah like w3m
[04:30] <Xaser> ehj20: no
[04:30] <grndslm> cynical...so, samba's the "easiest" to setup, eh?
[04:30] <voraistos> Xaser try w3m google.com
[04:30] <voraistos> in a console
[04:30] <ChocoCid> So, got a question.
[04:30] <cynical> grndslm: for me it was automatic
[04:31] <ChocoCid> Why does left alt do something different than right alt?
[04:31] <cynical> grndslm: not sure why you are having so much trouble
[04:31] <ChocoCid> namely, in firefox 2.0 (actually swiftfox) left alt+ arrowkeys work to go back/forward, and right alt doesn't
[04:31] <dragoon> I'm using edgy, but there's two packages which I'd rather use the dapper version of, so I rebuilt them for edgy. How can I make synaptic not upgrade them? Lock version or Force Version doesn't seem to work.
[04:31] <grndslm> cynical, it's all good...i like a challenge from time to time
[04:31] <voraistos> ChocoCid: 2 different keys, 2 different actions :)
[04:31] <ChocoCid> so what's right alt do?
[04:31] <abovett> voraistos: what about running ethereal? Maybe one of us could look at the logs and see what's going on?
[04:32] <ChocoCid> and/or is there a way to remap it?
[04:32] <voraistos> ChocoCid: depends of what software you are running :P
[04:32] <voraistos> abovett : yeah
[04:32] <ChocoCid> ubuntu edgy, gnome, swiftfox 2.0
[04:32] <m4jqp> does xorg 7.1 work in ubuntu?
[04:33] <dusk> all my screen fonts (proggyfonts.com) look very blurry in edgy, is there a workaround?
[04:33] <jason> Thanks.
[04:33] <voraistos> ChocoCid: on firefox it would probably be the same. on gnome... gnome is not really just software. but if you run metacity, compiz or beryl, ull see the difference
[04:33] <ChocoCid> yes, i run beryl at times
[04:33] <ChocoCid> and it totally breaks some of my shortcuts
[04:34] <abovett> Xaser: can you run ethereal whilst trying to browse and save a log? Maybe one of us can look at it?
[04:34] <ChocoCid> (that i have set in metacity)
[04:34] <bimberi> m4jqp: Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) has xorg 7.1
[04:34] <ChocoCid> so... how do i set right-alt to do the same thing as left-alt?
[04:34] <voraistos> Xaser. you have to install ethereal
[04:34] <Xaser> ok
[04:34] <twitch> could someone kinda help me out with getting my ATI card working? i have tried many times and the x server doesnt start at the boot up (pain to fix)
[04:35] <ChocoCid> twitch : you can start X manually?
[04:35] <voraistos> ChocoCid: depends of the software again. you have to see that in the soft's config itself. Or try to look in system preferences.
[04:35] <ChocoCid> voraistos: exactly which software? firefox/swiftfox?
[04:36] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:36] <voraistos> ChocoCid: uh. ure being too specific. but i dont think you can set it up nin firefox nor swiftfox
[04:36] <Clarrisa> having a brain fart...how do I search for a file or folder in linux? I'm trying to use ls -R <filename> but it always says no such file or directory even when I know it's there
[04:36] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa: locate filename
[04:36] <voraistos> ChocoCid: i think you should take a look in your keyboard config
[04:36] <twitch> yes chococid i know how to start X manually
[04:37] <ehj20> find / -name ....
[04:37] <bimberi> Clarrisa: find . -name filename
[04:37] <ChocoCid> twitch: then just put the command sequence you use there in your startup?
[04:37] <Clarrisa> bimeri, does that support wildcards?
[04:37] <Clarrisa> I"m actually trying to see where imagemagick is installed
[04:37] <dusk> all my screen fonts (proggyfonts.com) look very blurry in edgy, is there a workaround?
[04:37] <bimberi> Clarrisa: find . -name "*string*"
[04:37] <sid> What is a good application for designing a flier?
[04:37] <puneit> exit
[04:37] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa: probably /usr/bin/imagemagick
[04:38] <__mikem> look I really need help with mozilla thunderbird, the smtp settings that work fine on my ubuntu box for the same e-mail account don't work on my windows machine. The mozilla and thunerbird chanels are empty. Could someone tell me what to do?

[04:38] <twitch> i am willing to put up my xorg.conf
[04:39] <m4jqp> is edgy > dapper?
[04:39] <ChocoCid> heh. i've got to figure out a place to put meta , super, and hyper
[04:39] <bimberi> sid: sorry, scribus (not inkscape)
[04:39] <ChocoCid> m4jqp : depends on what you're using them for
[04:39] <bimberi> m4jqp: edgy is the latest release
[04:39] <spiderworm> does anyone know if there has been any major firewall change from dapper to edgy that might hinder a pptp server from responding to a connection request?
[04:39] <azureal> sound is kernel independent...and because of that I am screwed unless i ... reinstall?!
[04:40] <wd> anybody use enlightenment?
[04:40] <ChocoCid> wd: i used it
[04:40] <ChocoCid> it broke
[04:40] <ChocoCid> i removed it
[04:40] <abovett> funshineBear: I had something similar. You may find that some of the packages didn't update. Can you  boot to a comsole?
[04:40] <ChocoCid> that happened in the span of about 10-15 minutes
[04:40] <sid> bimberi: ahh, that's what I had opened before I asked the question. good suggestion
[04:40] <markedwards> hi, I'm trying to do a custom build of the netatalk package, and I'm running into the following error: gpg: skipped "Sebastian Rittau <srittau@debian.org>": secret key not available

[04:40] <ChocoCid> yeah
[04:40] <m4jqp> so for coolness you use edgy
[04:40] <m4jqp> :)
[04:40] <TheZork> hey guys
[04:40] <voraistos> Xaser. are u done ?
[04:40] <ChocoCid> i preferred beryl's setup anyway
[04:40] <ChocoCid> ;)
[04:40] <markedwards> should I do the build without gpg, or is there a better way to fix this?
[04:40] <wd> ChocoCid  no way, what happened
[04:40] <TheZork> is there any bugs with the edgy amd64 installer
[04:41] <funshineBear> abovett: i think so
[04:41] <Xaser> still getting an internet borwser  LOL
[04:41] <TheZork> mine keeps freezing at 44 percent
[04:41] <ChocoCid> oh, mainly the fact that i couldn't get a lot of stuff to work
[04:41] <Xaser> 50%
[04:41] <ChocoCid> screens went blank
[04:41] <ChocoCid> had a hell of a time trying to get it to log out
[04:41] <bimberi> m4jqp: they're both pretty cook :) but edgy is more up to date
[04:41] <voraistos> abovett : you might have to keep up with this guy. its 3 41 AM here. i need some sleep. i should get up in 2 hours
[04:41] <ChocoCid> couldn't switch back without restarting X
[04:41] <bimberi> m4jqp: *cook
[04:41] <bimberi> m4jqp: *cool (sheesh)
[04:41] <aSt3raL> how do i install the flashplugin-nonfree for edgy on amd64?
[04:41] <roughtrader> can anyone recommend a good bittorrent client?
[04:41] <dragoon> Anyone have experience locking personally-built packages so they're not upgraded? Care to share them?
[04:41] <abovett> funshineBear: try sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:42] <alpha255> roughtrader, azurus?
[04:42] <wd> ChocoCid sh_t.   hmmmmm, i'm stuck on ubuntu especially because of the support. but elive sure looks pretty nice.
[04:42] <aSt3raL> anyone know where theres a amd64 flash package?
[04:42] <abovett> voraistos: same problem here!
[04:42] <alpha255> roughtrader, java based
[04:42] <ChocoCid> no clue what elive is
[04:42] <roughtrader> azureus consumes too much resources
[04:42] <voraistos> lol
[04:42] <abovett> Should be asleep!
[04:42] <bimberi> dragoon: did you install the package using an apt tool?
[04:42] <roughtrader> I'm thinking along the lines of C++ based
[04:42] <funshineBear> i've done that already, but if you think it will help, i'll do it again
[04:42] <ChocoCid> voraistos: thanks, i moved my meta key to a key that's not on my keyboard since i never use meta :P
[04:42] <roughtrader> like utorrent for windows
[04:42] <dudesmithy> I have an existing system (WinXP) which is running in Raid 1 (SATA).  I have a 3rd Hard Drive (Also Sata) that I want to install edgy on...Anything special I need to worry about?
[04:42] <wd> enlightenment company made distro using debian.
[04:42] <Xaser> voraistor: for the ethereal, I would need the debian package?
[04:42] <ChocoCid> wd: isn't enlightenment "basically" dead?
[04:42] <spiderworm> bimberi: im thinking that something is blocking the pptp server's ability to respond to my client.... like a firewall or something..... do you know perchance if there have been firewall changes in edgy?
[04:42] <wd> ChocoCid not sure
[04:43] <ChocoCid> i thought there hadn't been updates on it in a long time
[04:43] <TheZork> anyone have any input on why edgy install freezes at 44 percent??
[04:43] <wd> ChocoCid  oh.
[04:43] <voraistos> Xaser: yeah. just apt-get it ! sudo apt-get install ethereal
[04:43] <ChocoCid> i dunno, beryl/compix is hotness, enlightenment may just be yesterday's news anyway
[04:43] <dragoon> bimberi, dpkg. I rebuilt a dapper version package for edgy, as the new version is eh..
[04:43] <spiderworm> roughtrader: i like ktorrent
[04:43] <markedwards> can anyone give me some debuild advice?
[04:43] <abovett> funshimeBear: Yes - you may need to do it more than once. You may also need to do some other things but try that a couple times first.
[04:43] <spiderworm> roughtrader: but then, im using kubuntu
[04:43] <bimberi> spiderworm: i'm not aware of any, but i'm not in that sort of loop though
[04:43] <bimberi> dragoon: if so, you can use "Lock Version" from the Package menu in Synaptic
[04:43] <spiderworm> bimberi: do you know who i could bug about this?
[04:43] <roughtrader> yuk, kde
[04:43] <wd> ChocoCid i seem to keep coming back to ubuntu, gnome.... lol....    o' faithful...
[04:44] <ChocoCid> beryl runs on top of gnome actually
[04:44] <roughtrader> kde has to be the ugliest thing on the face of the planet
[04:44] <ChocoCid> it just replaces metacity
[04:44] <ChocoCid> and yeah, agreed on that point
[04:44] <ChocoCid> thought i don't mind kde apps inside gnome, like krita
[04:44] <ChocoCid> (and man, the new krita is awesomeness)
[04:44] <spiderworm> ChocoCid: agreed
[04:44] <wd> ChocoCid  educate me krita?
[04:44] <ChocoCid> if you do any image editing at all, get krita
[04:44] <roughtrader> I just got my new Dell 2407WFP today
[04:44] <roughtrader> this display rocks
[04:44] <ChocoCid> i think sudo apt-get install krita gets it
[04:44] <bimberi> spiderworm: not really, reporting a bug is the best way to get a devs attention
[04:44] <spiderworm> wd: it's like gimp, but with a good interface, and layer folders!
[04:44] <wd>  ChocoCid better that inkscape?
[04:45] <ChocoCid> might have to get all of koffice
[04:45] <ChocoCid> wd: different
[04:45] <ChocoCid> inkscape is vectorbased
[04:45] <ChocoCid> krita is raster-based
[04:45] <abovett> Xaser, voraistos: will have to go now. Xaser: will try to check in 12.00am UK time tomorrow.
[04:45] <ChocoCid> they serve entirely different purposes
[04:45] <ChocoCid> really not comparable
[04:45] <spiderworm> im really happy about layer folders
[04:45] <spiderworm> wtf is up with gimp developers
[04:45] <ChocoCid> and it's not like you can't run both :P
[04:45] <wd> ChocoCid  ok. i just want to edit and tweak reg. jpegs and thngs.
[04:45] <ChocoCid> krita's pretty good at that
[04:45] <Clarrisa> sigh... I did an apt-get for imagemagick.  apt-get did it's thing...installed it, but I still can't find it on my damn drive..... argh!!
[04:45] <aSt3raL> anyone know how to install flash on amd64 edgy?
[04:45] <aSt3raL> im having problems
[04:45] <roughtrader> is it possible to configure port-forwarding with the gnome bittorrent client?
[04:45] <TaPiOn> Hi
[04:46] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa : it should be in your menus
[04:46] <cynical> aSt3raL: there is no 64-bit flash
[04:46] <dragoon> bimberi, how would I install personally-built packages through apt?
[04:46] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:46] <Flannel> dragoon: through dpkg not apt
[04:46] <wd> ChocoCid still dual booting like me or strictly linux?
[04:46] <cynical> roughtrader: you configure port forwarding using your router
[04:46] <aSt3raL> cynical: i have to compile from source then?
[04:46] <Clarrisa> chococid.  I'm only at the command line.... I don't have a gui installed
[04:46] <ChocoCid> wd: i "can" dual boot
[04:46] <spiderworm> dragoon: dpkg -i <package>\
[04:46] <spiderworm> oops
[04:46] <cynical> roughtrader: do you know the make and model of it?
[04:46] <spiderworm> without the trailing \
[04:46] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa : do "locate imagemagick | less"
[04:46] <voraistos> Xaser: i live in UK too... i need to go to bed :( sorry. but after install, launch  sudo wireshark. select your capture device and capture. you might see things by yourself
[04:46] <wd> ChocoCid but?
[04:46] <ChocoCid> wd: i don't ever load windows anymore
[04:47] <Flannel> aSt3raL: there's no source
[04:47] <abovett> funshineBear: have to go now. Try apt-get dist-upgrade a couple of times, then perhaps apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (or xubuntu-desktop if that's what you're running).
[04:47] <cynical> aSt3raL: no, there is no amd64 version yet, and adobe has not yet announced when or if they will make one
[04:47] <holycow> ChocoCid, pretty cool eh?
[04:47] <regeya> satan, thy true name is edgy
[04:47] <wd> ChocoCid  u bold...lol    i wish i could.
[04:47] <roughtrader> cynical: i know how to configure the router, but gnome bittorrent has to know the port number
[04:47] <ChocoCid> why can't you?
[04:47] <dragoon> flannel spiderworm: Yeah, I know that, the question is then how do I lock those personally built packages so the inferior but updated edgy packages don't replace them.
[04:47] <wd> holycow  damn long time.
[04:47] <roughtrader> the number itself can be arbitrary
[04:47] <cynical> aSt3raL: most people just install a 32-bit binary of firefox for flash
[04:47] <Xaser> TYVM Voraistos
[04:47] <holycow> wd lol
[04:47] <holycow> wow
[04:47] <holycow> where ya been hidin?
[04:47] <ChocoCid> holycow: i've hated windows for years
[04:47] <regeya> c'mon, ubuntu-base and upstart list dhcp3-client as a dep?  meh.
[04:47] <aSt3raL> Flannel: what about the non-free version?
[04:47] <Flannel> dragoon: pinning them
[04:47] <wd> ChocoCid because of certain software.
[04:47] <jtf0518> I have to use and support Windows all day so I hardly ever load Windows at home....unless I'm feeling constipated.
[04:47] <ChocoCid> only recently got into linux because until i heard of ubuntu i thought linux was a server type thing
[04:47] <Flannel> aSt3raL: the non-free version is non-free because there is no source.
[04:48] <ChocoCid> the stuff the layperson "knows" about linux is quite awful
[04:48] <cynical> roughtrader: I've never used gnome bittorrent, it doesnt have preferences of some kind?
[04:48] <roughtrader> unfortunately, no
[04:48] <dragoon> Flannel, I thought pinning was for repositories, it works for local packages too?
[04:48] <spiderworm> dragoon: good question
[04:48] <aSt3raL> damn
[04:48] <wd> holycow  ubuntu blues, with that lexmard printer so i stuck with windows, but i just bought a linux / windows printer so i'll try it again... lol
[04:48] <cynical> ChocoCid: very true, everyone I know thinks its all command line and extremely complicated
[04:48] <ChocoCid> wd: which software exactly?
[04:48] <roughtrader> so is azureus any good? or does it consume all memory after a while of usage?
[04:48] <bruenig> roughtrader, crazy memory usage
[04:48] <cynical> roughtrader: damn, I would suggest at least using deluge if you dont like azureus
[04:48] <regeya> don't know how difficult it is to install transmission on this platform, but on os x I use transmission, and it > *
[04:49] <ChocoCid> roughtrader: i used azzy on windows before, i've used it on linux, the memory usage is basically java-type issues
[04:49] <ChocoCid> it's not much worse than firefox afaik
[04:49] <roughtrader> yeah
[04:49] <grndslm> soo...anybody gotta clue as to whether i need to add the windows user's name to my box before i can connect with samba??
[04:49] <bruenig> roughtrader, it is not uncommon for it to be running at 100 MB, at least it wasn't for me
[04:49] <cynical> roughtrader: no actually it doesnt. It uses only 80mb of memory on my computer
[04:49] <regeya> transmission should be gnome-philosophy-friendly too...don't know how hig-compliant it is
[04:49] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:49] <Flannel> grndslm: you don't
[04:49] <roughtrader> that's why I like C-based clients
[04:49] <Flannel> !samba | grndslm
[04:49] <ubotu> grndslm: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:49] <ChocoCid> !bittorrent
[04:49] <roughtrader> tomato torrent for mac and utorrent for windows are both great
[04:49] <ubotu> bittorrent: Scatter-gather network file transfer. In component main, is optional. Version 3.4.2-6ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 90 kB, installed size 556 kB
[04:49] <ChocoCid> heh
[04:49] <ChocoCid> !torrent
[04:49] <ubotu> Torrent clients: Azureus (Java), BitTornado (Shell with python front-end), KTorrent (KDE/Qt)  -  Bittorent FAQ: http://www.bittorrent.com/FAQ.html
[04:49] <mkoby> I was once at school discussing a computer that I fixed with some classmates, and some idiot walked up and said"Oh yeah? I can fix computers too, I'm smart,"
[04:49] <Clarrisa> chococid, my hell I'm mentally challenged.... typing locate imagemagick returns nothing...just brings up the ubuntu prompt again... adding the pipe with the less command puts a blank screen with the word [end]  at the bottom
[04:49] <grndslm> wow...i wonder how many samba guides i can get in an hour
[04:49] <cynical> bruenig: is that really a lot? Most people have at least 512MB of memory these days
[04:49] <holycow> wd, we switched to brother
[04:49] <roughtrader> i'm not sure what client is like that for linux
[04:49] <holycow> all brother models work and they offer even debian installer
[04:49] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa: that means imagemagick isn't being found
[04:50] <Clarrisa> chococid and yet I know it just installed imagemagick a second ago
[04:50] <ChocoCid> that's... odd
[04:50] <wd> ChocoCid  uh oh another linux can beat windows speech....lol. well, ok i got one for u, my cell phone ring tone software, money ( i know there gnucash) no the same.
[04:50] <ChocoCid> type "man imagemagick" in the command line
[04:50] <cynical> roughtrader: well deluge is pretty light on the resources, unfortunately its not quite got all the functionality of utorrent.
[04:50] <holycow> brother btw, happens to be owned by lexmark of all things
[04:50] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:50] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:50] <holycow> >_>
[04:50] <ChocoCid> yeah, i didn't like gnucash
[04:50] <bruenig> cynical, for a bittorrent client, I think it is. I guess it depends on your system and your thoughts on how much a bittorrent client should consume. When something so singular in its purpose and so limited in its purpose takes up 2X as much RAM as a browser or some other fairly dynamic app, that seems a bit much
[04:50] <bruenig> cynical, also considering the alternatives are so much lighter
[04:50] <wd> holycow thats aweful,  i mean lexmark is crap and brother got the good end of the stick...lol
[04:51] <Clarrisa> chococid if I type apt-get -f -y install imagemagick again, it says "imagemagick is already the newest version.
[04:51] <holycow> so far brother is rocking our socks
[04:51] <ChocoCid> Clarrisa: could try remove and install again
[04:51] <roughtrader> hmmm
[04:51] <Cronh> alguien de espaa,porfavor?
[04:51] <ChocoCid> the one thing I know windows has that isn't quite as good on linux is a spreadsheet program
[04:51] <bruenig> !es
[04:51] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:51] <holycow> products are really handling well ... very surprising
[04:51] <roughtrader> the issue here is only the port-forwarding
[04:51] <wd> holycow i have a hp 3100 series all in one and i made sure it was linux compatible.
[04:51] <ChocoCid> excel is > oocalc :(
[04:51] <Clarrisa> cd usr
[04:51] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:51] <Clarrisa> cd bin
[04:51] <spiderworm> Cronh: que deseas
[04:51] <Clarrisa> oops
[04:51] <holycow> wd it is?
[04:51] <cynical> bruenig: well I have 1GB of memory, and to be honest, when using windows I could understand calling azureus a memory hog. But in linux I rarely use above 300MB, even after I load everything I could possibly use at one time
[04:51] <ChocoCid> lol, i do that all the time Clarrisa
[04:51] <roughtrader> if I could only get gnome bittorrent to be configured to the right port...
[04:51] <holycow> hp is known for having shit support for their scanners
[04:51] <Clarrisa> lol
[04:51] <ChocoCid> XSANE!
[04:51] <ChocoCid> <3
[04:52] <holycow> wd, coo to hear that you researched your hardware before you bought :)
[04:52] <ChocoCid> my parents had all kinds of issues with windows, they had winMe
[04:52] <pluto> Question about source list ~ What is the purpose of source list.d?
[04:52] <holycow> i wish everyone did that, then 3/4rs of the crap companies would dissapear out there
[04:52] <grndslm> Flannel, you got any idea why windows would require me to type in a username/pass to connect to samba?
[04:52] <ChocoCid> i set themselves up ubuntu and they've had no problems
[04:52] <bruenig> cynical, yeah. I am limited to 512 MB and I think my onboard graphics card reserves a portion of that. So I have to keep it a bit low
[04:52] <ColdFyre> can someone running dapper paste the cdrom line form /etc/apt/sources.list?
[04:52] <wd> holycow well when i was at the store i went online to hp and saw the deb installer info on it before i bought it.
[04:52] <cynical> bruenig: so for me, it just seems moot to complain about memory usage, I mean any memory that isnt being used is being wasted (at least in windows, I understand linux has a way of dealing with unused memory)
[04:52] <ColdFyre> or pm me it
[04:52] <roughtrader> shoot, how do I group tar a bunch of tar.gz files?
[04:52] <Flannel> grndslm: because you need one, linux would too.  A samba username/password
[04:52] <holycow> wd, since when does hp have deb installers?
[04:52] <holycow> wow
[04:52] <roughtrader> I'm trying tar xzvf *.gz
[04:52] <roughtrader> but it's giving a bunch of errors
[04:53] <grndslm> Flannel, could you explain how i'd set that up?
[04:53] <cynical> Flannel: you dont need one
[04:53] <Flannel> grndslm: the links ubotu gave you has all that info
[04:53] <wd> holycow well it showed a linux installation page...
[04:53] <teledyn> roughtrader: uncompress or compress?
[04:53] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:53] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:53] <dragoon> Alright, looks like I can pin local packages, but it's complicated. Ah well.
[04:53] <roughtrader> teledyn: uncompress
[04:53] <holycow> wd,  thats VERY new.  they NEVER used to do that
[04:53] <_goofy_> anyone know of a program to tell me if a HDD is about to fail
[04:53] <bruenig> cynical, like right now, I have gaim, xchat, firefox, and utorrent running, and I am at 140 MB usage. It seems kind of absurd to have a bittorrent client consume nearly as much as all of that
[04:53] <grndslm> yea, i've read howtos for the past hour, and they're all different
[04:53] <alpha255> _goofy_, smart

[04:54] <Slor|AFK> Hello all
[04:54] <grndslm> Flannel, and there's like 100 different places where there's a separate need for a username...i don't get why this is so damn hard
[04:54] <bruenig> !hi | Slor|AFK
[04:54] <ubotu> Slor|AFK: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:54] <_tg_> I want to install ubuntu but someone told me I should back-up windows how can I do that
[04:54] <teledyn> roughtrader: for file in *.tar.gz; do tar -xzf $file; done
[04:54] <bruenig> _tg_, do you have a cd or dvd drive and some blank cd
[04:54] <bruenig> cd's or dvd's
[04:54] <roughtrader> teledyn: noted, but I get a stream of errors
[04:54] <Slor|AFK> I'm very new to Ubuntu (but old with Linux)
[04:55] <_tg_> I dont have any cds
=== Slor|AFK is now known as Slor
[04:55] <roughtrader> tar: blahblah.tar.gz: Not found in archive
[04:55] <cynical> bruenig: Yes  you do have a good point. If there were a linux clients that supported encryption and dht I'd switch but until then some of us just dont even have a choice *sigh*. Azureus has so much functionality they really should look into optimizing it now, and lowering its memory usage
[04:55] <wd> holycow anyway i tried gentoo, but after 4 days of compiling and system on 34 of 154 apps i said forget it, it worked and was blazing fast. i like the concept of gentoo being "built for u" i mean the compiling to ur architecture and all but i figure ubuntu is just as fast if i chose xfce or fluxbox
[04:55] <Flannel> grndslm: you have a samba user/password, because samba needs to know who you are, and you might not want some users to be able to have samba access, which is why you need to set them up initially, instead of it re-using your linux ones
[04:55] <lib8264q> can someomne tell me the command for reconfiguring xserver-xorg ? ty
[04:55] <roughtrader> repeated for each file I try to group uncompress
[04:55] <bruenig> cynical, utorrent has it.......
[04:55] <holycow> wd actually all of that is crap gentoo users tell each other
[04:55] <teledyn> roughtrader: oops
[04:55] <cynical> bruenig: yes but I'd rather not wine my torrent client
[04:55] <akijikan> anyone:
[04:55] <wd> holycow no  lol
[04:55] <holycow> co compile you haveto have A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE
[04:55] <Slor> got a quick question - I want to install on a Sun Enterprise 420R .  Is there a preference between 6.06 and 6.10?
[04:55] <holycow> yes
[04:56] <eSeong> i wish i could get some help on my dlink dwl-122
[04:56] <lib8264q> can someomne tell me the command for reconfiguring xserver-xorg ?
[04:56] <eSeong> anyone here could get it to work on ubuntu ?
[04:56] <mkoby> Slor: Where's you get your's?
[04:56] <holycow> most self compiled apps are not even marginally optimal as they are compiled by know nothing noobs
[04:56] <teledyn> roughtrader: for file in *.tar.gz do; tar -xzf $file.tar.gz; done
[04:56] <Slor> the server?
[04:56] <wd> holycow hmmmj.
[04:56] <mkoby> Slor: Yes, I've got three.
[04:56] <Syco54645> cd #slackware
[04:56] <alpha255> what's the difference between the desktop and alternate iso download?
[04:56] <holycow> there are tons of tests out there that simply prove gentoo overall is slower than a simple debian base install
[04:56] <Slor> My office gave away some old equipment.
[04:56] <holycow> its all nonsense
[04:56] <teledyn> roughtrader: actually no.  the first one should have been correct
[04:56] <holycow> gentoo is great if your a dev and need that flexibility but
[04:56] <mkoby> Slor: But haven't played with them much, what are they like?
[04:56] <wd> holycow come on man
[04:57] <holycow> its also retarded because you still have that here with source packages
[04:57] <Slor> Where are you located, just for fun?
[04:57] <mkoby> Slor: Bethesda, MD.
[04:57] <bimberi> dragoon: using checkinstall (sorry got called away)
[04:57] <mkoby> Slor: You?
[04:57] <bruenig> holycow, it depends on the user. If you know what you are doing, it will probably be better. If you don't know or don't care to put the effort in maintaining a system like that, probably not.
[04:57] <perl_cont> sup
[04:57] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[04:57] <perl_cont> interest
[04:57] <holycow> wd, take it or leave it, i do this for a living.  research what i'm tellin gyou an dyou will see that for most use cases its completely correct
[04:57] <Slor> Ok.  Just wondered because I took this from a rack of 4.  Thought perhaps you were the other recipient. :)
[04:57] <eSeong> anyone here could get dlink dwl-122 usb to work on ubuntu ?
[04:57] <Clarrisa> what does it mean when I type exit and bash says "There are stopped jobs."  what do I do?
[04:57] <Slor> I'm in Indianapolis, IN.
[04:58] <holycow> bruenig, thats what i wrote actually ... most users don't know and will never actually gain the knowledge
[04:58] <mkoby> Slor: Nah, I bought mine without rails or bezels or any plastiat
[04:58] <dragoon> bimberi, ah, no, I built it as a standard deb already. And you can pin specific versions through /etc/apt/preferences, but thanks for the tip.
[04:58] <wd> holycow well, i know that ubuntu is fast with fluxbox and even faster with xfce but fluxbox doesn't work with nautilus and xfce's right click feature kept quitting on me after term closed.
[04:58] <holycow> you really haveto know your stuff to truly optimize things at that level
[04:58] <Slor> I'm not sure if I need to stick with the 6.06 that appears to be fully supported or if I should go to 6.10.
[04:58] <Slor> Oh, ok.
[04:58] <bimberi> Clarrisa: type 'fg' to bring them to the foreground
[04:58] <eSeong> ah sad, no one can help me =.=!
[04:58] <grndslm> 6.10!!!!
[04:58] <Slor> The plastic just breaks anyway.
[04:58] <mkoby> Slor: I'd stick with 6.06, because it's only going to get more refined and polished.
[04:59] <Slor> wow this is a busy channel.
[04:59] <bimberi> dragoon: np, yes I think synaptic plays with that file.  It just provides a nice interface :)
[04:59] <Clarrisa> bimberi.... oh no , now I am in some endless loop from when I typed find blah | less
[04:59] <alpha255> what's the difference between the desktop and alternate iso?
[04:59] <bruenig> holycow, ok, well I agree then. It looked like you were making a real blanket statement there. Gentoo is also fun because it forces you to  learn more, which some people need. Some people if given the option to just click something instead of understanding it will probably choose the former unless they weren't given that option. So gentoo can also serve that purpose
[04:59] <bimberi> Clarrisa: ctrl-C
[04:59] <teledyn> eSeong: google is your best bet for a specific model like that
[04:59] <holycow> bruenig, thats what its fore yup
[04:59] <bimberi> !alternate | alpha255
[04:59] <ubotu> alpha255: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[04:59] <holycow> it is very much a ricer distro :)
[04:59] <eSeong> teledyn : i tried mostly on the ubuntu forum, i still can't get work..
[04:59] <cynical> alpha255: the alternate iso provides a text based installer for slower computers while the desktop iso is a livecd, letting you test ubuntu without actually installing it on your computer
[05:00] <dragoon> bimberi, well, it didn't seem to want to in this case, probably because my self-built files weren't in the repo. Ah, the waste that could be avoided if the devs actually upgraded the program when they bumped the version!
[05:00] <Gex> personally i liked gentoo.. i just didn't like how it took hours to emerge something like openoffice.
[05:00] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[05:00] <bimberi> alpha255: whereas the desktop cd is a live cd
[05:00] <cynical> alpha255: its recommended to use the desktop cd if you have a computer with above 200MB of memory and around an 800mhz processor
[05:00] <Slor> Oh, one other thing
[05:00] <bimberi> dragoon: kk
[05:00] <wd> holycow  hey i just upgrade to amd sempron 2800, 512 ram, feel like a big dog.... lol... anyway edgy works but i'm reading alot of 64 amd problems in forums. i uninstalled and partitioned. can i run 32 bit on my amd64?
[05:00] <eSeong> teledyn : unless, someone have a working dlink dwl-122....
[05:00] <Slor> Does the SPARC build support multi-processor out of th box?
[05:00] <alpha255> cynical, thnx :)
[05:00] <mkoby> wd: Yes.
[05:00] <Slor> or will I need to rebuild the kernel
[05:00] <cynical> alpha255: sure :)
[05:01] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ?????
[05:01] <wd> mkoby no
[05:01] <alpha255> cynical, I can install from the live/desktop cd too right?
[05:01] <holycow> wd,  not sure i don't run 64 bit as its pointless
[05:01] <mkoby> wd: It won't use the 64 bit features, though.
[05:01] <Gex> TaPiOn: it should say on the bottom left
[05:01] <jrib> TaPiOn: view > stream and media info, don't be afraid to explore the menus
[05:01] <mkoby> wd: Oh?
[05:01] <chapium> gex, me too.. i screwed a few things up, went to reinstall and lost patience.  The frustration was exacerbated by a funky heat monitor on the motherboard that thinks its over heating if its halfway compiling through openoffice
[05:01] <cynical> alpha255: yes, when you boot there will be a small icon on your desktop labeled, install
[05:01] <wd> holycow dang..... why u say that?
[05:01] <wd> holycow lol
[05:01] <alpha255> cycom, sweet thanks! :)
[05:01] <TaPiOn> How can I know the video lenght with vlc ???? in a shell !!
[05:01] <chapium> holycow: best handle ever
[05:01] <holycow> nothing can use 64 bit cpus except things that need 64 bit registers or things that need access to a lot of ram
[05:02] <wd> mkoby which features?
[05:02] <teledyn> TaPiOn: stop flooding the channel with the same question every 10s please
[05:02] <holycow> :)
[05:02] <cynical> 64-bit isnt pointless
[05:02] <TaPiOn> teledyn awser me
[05:02] <cynical> in certain applications it can make a huge difference in speed
[05:02] <TaPiOn> please
[05:02] <TaPiOn> :)
[05:02] <wd> holycow uh oh, cynical has spoken..lol
[05:02] <cynical> but the hassle for beginners usually isnt worth it
[05:02] <cynical> :P
[05:02] <teledyn> TaPiOn: actually, you're going on my ignore list right now.  bye
[05:02] <Earthen> anyway to do a quick repair after a failed upgrade atempt
[05:02] <wd> cynical get em
[05:02] <TaPiOn> fu teledyn
[05:03] <mkoby> wd: I really don't know, I think it's more on a low-level difference.
[05:03] <wd> cynical  lol
[05:03] <holycow> typically you only see performance gains with 64 bit with things like 3d renderers, video editing, etc.  very few users even have a clue as to what 64 bit really is
[05:03] <Gex> chapium: oh man... i first loaded it onto an old laptop.. and it was my first linux experience.. so it was good.. but the late nights troubleshooting through things like ndiswrapper wireless stuff almost killed me.
[05:03] <cynical> compare compiling or encoding video using a 32-bit and a 64-bit processor
[05:03] <jimmygoon> Can I get some help quickly: I need to use the LiveCD ... but I need access to the DVD drive to burn a backup dvd (bit of a frantic emergency right now!!!!)
[05:03] <jimmygoon> What do I do?
[05:03] <mkoby> ndiswrapper is a bitch to configure.
[05:03] <cynical> the difference is huge
[05:03] <holycow> compiling would be another yes
[05:03] <holycow> but then again, regular users don't compile or use gentoo
[05:03] <eSeong> anyone here could get dlink dwl-122 usb to work on ubuntu ?
[05:03] <wd> cynical processing graphic?
[05:03] <cynical> holycow: but yes I agree with you, most users are in over their heads when they try to use it
[05:04] <Slor> I compile plenty, but gentoo is still a little more effort than I care to go to at installation.
[05:04] <holycow> graphics are handled by gpu at this point unless of course your running linux with vesa in which case you still won't see any difference
[05:04] <akijikan> anyone: I made a modeline for my 1440x900 monitor using http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl and when I reset x server the monitor lost signal and it never came back
[05:04] <cynical> wd: you see the differences in a lot of memory intensive apps
[05:04] <cynical> yes it wouldn't make much of a difference in gaming really
[05:05] <wd> cynical holycow well i did the 64 edgy, but wine doesn't work, and 32 codecs, so darn , do i have to downgrade to 32?
[05:05] <jeff__> how do i copy and paste in CLI if mouse doesn't work? (My xserver is broken)
[05:05] <holycow> wd, its linux dude, you don't haveto call nobody to get an activation code
[05:05] <holycow> reinstall
[05:05] <teledyn> jeff__: gpm
[05:05] <cynical> wd: Well for wmv support you just have to compile mplayer
[05:05] <jimmygoon> Can I get some help quickly: I need to use the LiveCD ... but I need access to the DVD drive to burn a backup dvd (bit of a frantic emergency right now!!!!)
[05:05] <cynical> wd: the latest version supports it natively
[05:06] <wd> holycow lol
[05:06] <teledyn> jeff__: but beware because it can mess up mouse support under x
[05:06] <wd> cynical  ok so get the mplayer tar and compile?
[05:06] <NightHawke> dapper and a intel 915 video chipset, i cant see the full sized install screen
[05:06] <holycow> wd now i remember you, you like to do everything the hard way
[05:06] <holycow> *cough*
[05:06] <holycow> >_>
[05:06] <wd> holycow   hey......lol
[05:06] <Gex> wd you can probably just use apt-get to install mplayer.
[05:06] <jeff__> teledyn: so what should i do? how can i know if it will in fact make a problem?
[05:06] <holycow> j/k :)
[05:07] <wd> Gex thanks
[05:07] <Earthen> Are allot of people have trouble upgrading to edgy
[05:07] <wd> holycow ok i'm going to try this again.
[05:07] <teledyn> jeff__: read the docs about editing your xorg config for use with gpm
[05:07] <NightHawke> how can i force the display to change to 800x600 or higher?
[05:07] <holycow> if you believe slashdot Earthen then yes, but then again if you believe slashdot ronald mcdonald is real
[05:07] <holycow> hows THAT for a non answer?
[05:07] <holycow> >_>
[05:07] <holycow> :)
[05:07] <Slor> well crap - illegal instruction trying to install 6.06
[05:07] <Earthen> lol
[05:07] <mkoby> holycow: Well said.
[05:07] <jeff__> teledyn: ok
[05:08] <nick_> hello gentlemen, anyone try out compiz in the new edgy?
[05:08] <cynical> wd: no you have to compile mplayer
[05:08] <wd> holycow cynical look, i just dl illustrator and studio 8 for windows, linux can't pull off apps like those. can it? gimp, no.
[05:08] <Earthen> well I tryed it and now my gnome crashes when I try to reboot or shut down and it has killed my wifi card LOL
[05:08] <tritium> cynical: mplayer is in the repos
[05:08] <jimmygoon> Can I get some help quickly: I need to use the LiveCD ... but I need access to the DVD drive to burn a backup dvd (bit of a frantic emergency right now!!!!)
[05:08] <Lathiat> jimmygoon: can't do that im afraid
[05:08] <Lathiat> jimmygoon: need a second cd drive
[05:09] <cynical> tritium: not the latest version. He wants wmv support on 64-bit edgy, you have to compile mplayer for that
[05:09] <holycow> wd, and we JUST KNOW that you paid for those ... right?
[05:09] <chimpsky> jimmygoon: it's not that hard to create your own usb key from the live cd
[05:09] <holycow> *wink* *wink*
[05:09] <chad> what is the chmod command..to add user rights?
[05:09] <alpha255> nick_, compiz worked in dapper on my centrino notebook
[05:09] <teledyn> jimmygoon: rsync your data off the drive via network
[05:09] <cynical> chad: chown username /path/to/directory
[05:09] <alpha255> :)
[05:09] <chimpsky> jimmygoon: I had to do it in order to install on my intel forsaken 965 board
[05:09] <wd> holycow why of course..... wink
[05:09] <holycow> when you actually pay for any of your adobe products than come back here and gloat
[05:09] <holycow> :)
[05:09] <chad> 755?
[05:09] <chad> oh..ok
[05:10] <Flannel> chad: change file permissions.  chown changes file owners, both usually shouldn't be used.
[05:10] <regeya> whew.
[05:10] <regeya> all is well.
[05:10] <jimmygoon> no time :( thanks guys... any other ideas... how much would it kill me to enable ntfs-3g on a livecd of dapper?
[05:10] <cynical> yes I assumed you wanted to change owners
[05:10] <Flannel> chad: or rather, most of the time your permission issues should be dealt with with sudo, not chown/chmodding
[05:10] <wd> holycow i did uuuhhhh, it cost me a a lot of money...
[05:10] <holycow> riiiight
[05:10] <nick_> alpha225: arent there just a few commands that will enable it in edgy?
[05:10] <chad> well..i installed vmware player as root.. and now i need to start it from console all the time with sudo
[05:10] <alpha255> ahh just make everyting 777  ;)  << ment to be sarcstic
[05:11] <alpha255> sarcastic
[05:11] <mkoby> holycow: would you know how to get a Belkin
[05:11] <holycow> belkin what?
[05:11] <eSeong> anyone here could get dlink dwl-122 usb to work on ubuntu ?......
[05:11] <mkoby> holycow: would you know how to get a Belkin 802.11g USB adapter to work?
[05:11] <teledyn> jimmygoon: throw another drive in the machine
[05:11] <mkoby> holycow: f*cking enter key.
[05:11] <totall_6_7> eSeong: your question was answered:  <teledyn> eSeong: google is your best bet for a specific model like that
[05:11] <jimmygoon> teledyn: its a laptop :(
[05:11] <holycow> mkoby, nope dude, sorry, i research products and buy only what is known to work, not the other way :/
[05:11] <jimmygoon> the only ext-hd we have is NTFS :(
[05:11] <wd> cynical compile mplayer? get the tar.gz? how?
[05:11] <holycow> appologies
[05:11] <regeya> I had assigned eth0 a static ip in /etc/network/interfaces, ans some wiseacre made the decision to a.) automagically run dhcpclient on boot and b.) make dhcp a requirement
[05:12] <regeya> take that, joker
[05:12] <teledyn> jimmygoon: external usb drive?
[05:12] <bimberi> jimmygoon: can you copy files to another PC via the network?
[05:12] <mkoby> holycow: Would you be able to recommend something that will?
[05:12] <cynical> wd: http://www3.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.0rc1.tar.bz2
[05:12] <tritium> mkoby: watch the near-foul langauge, please
[05:12] <mkoby> tritium: Pardon me.
[05:12] <withaY> is it possible to easily configure a static ip if you're using wpa_supplicant & network-manager-gnome?
[05:12] <tritium> mkoby: no worries
[05:13] <alpha255> eSeong, google had quite a few entries, and it should work
[05:13] <akijikan> anyone: I made a modeline for my 1440x900 monitor using http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl and when I reset x server the monitor lost signal and it never came back same when I start up
[05:13] <wd> cynical i'm there, i'm on windows, i'll save it and load ubuntu and handle that. thanks.
[05:13] <jimmygoon> bimberi: thats what I'm gonna do... that or he's gonna have to shuttle stuff (imgaine floppies) with my 2gig (fat32) jumpdrive!
[05:13] <eSeong> alpha255 : okie, i'll try again then.. :(
[05:13] <cynical> wd: np
[05:13] <holycow> mkoby, not offhand, i mean for wireless pci/x cards its a google, if your using the usb dealie because your laptop wireless isn't supported i would google up pcmcia wireless cards those are also listed on the same page of supported cards on the ubuntu wiki
[05:13] <regeya> noticed on boot that my xorg.conf had been rewritten as well.  will it be left alone from now on, or am I being driven back to gentoo...
[05:14] <mkoby> holycow: Thanks for the help!
[05:14] <holycow> np
[05:14] <Seeker2599> how do i set my internal ip address?
[05:14] <teledyn> Seeker2599: man interfaces
[05:14] <wd> cynical hey, if i compile everything in ubuntu would it be to my advantage? verses precompiled apps?
[05:15] <victorh> Hi, I'm having a problem with my network configuration
[05:15] <tritium> wd: not really, no
[05:15] <holycow> lol
[05:15] <Seeker2599> teledyn: wheres that?
[05:15] <wd> tritiumoh
[05:15] <wd> tritium   oh
[05:15] <holycow> man wd you really LOOOOOOOVE doing everything the hard way
[05:15] <holycow> :)
[05:15] <holycow> hehehe
[05:15] <phI||Ip> whats that command to determine if you have 3d enabled?
[05:15] <teledyn> Seeker2599: type that in a console
[05:15] <Seeker2599> ok
[05:15] <wd> holycow   lol
[05:15] <holycow> wd, i bug ya, its cool the only way to learn actually
[05:15] <wd> holycow just want the best ubuntu can offer
[05:16] <CientificoLoco> hello everybaody I have a problem with a DVD if I want to copy file it starts to copy but ins some tell me that makes me fail with my laptop. je.
[05:16] <victorh> ubuntu edgy eft is using the driver dmfe for my ethernet driver. But this driver doesn't work with my card, I need to use the tulip driver
[05:16] <Slor> I've tried both 6.10 and 6.06 on my Sun server, and both have ended with Illegal Instruction during ramdisk load.  Anything specific I should try next?
[05:16] <wd> holycow remember when i dive in i really dive in...lol
[05:16] <Seeker2599> teledyn: ok now what
[05:16] <CientificoLoco> there is something that I can install and speed my reader DVD?
[05:16] <teledyn> Seeker2599: read what it says
[05:16] <Katsu|> How do i change my 6.10 to Japanese language?
[05:16] <victorh> How can I configure my card in ubuntu edgy eft?
[05:17] <CientificoLoco> victorh: which one card?
[05:17] <puneit> hi... I was upgrading from dapper to edgy and on restart X has failed to load...can anyone help
[05:17] <victorh> it's a Davicom card
[05:17] <wd> tritium  it's just that , well, everytime i load ubuntu and give a twirl, after loading apps it get's all slow.
[05:17] <victorh> an ethernet card
[05:18] <CientificoLoco> it confinges automatic when you install ubuntu
[05:18] <cynical> wd: well yes, generally its better to compile apps against your specific architecture
[05:18] <wd> tritium thats why i tried gentoo
[05:18] <wd> cynical  ok
[05:18] <wd> cynical  but wasting time huh?
[05:18] <Seeker2599> ty teledyn
[05:18] <victorh> in other distros I use the tulip driver but ubuntu has chosen the dmfe driver
[05:18] <tritium> wd: in general, you get diminishing returns for all the effort
[05:18] <wd> tritium  oh i see.
[05:18] <victorh> until now I have failed to change that configuration
[05:18] <akijikan> does ANYONE here know ANYTHING about modelines in xorg.conf
[05:18] <withaY> how can i assign myself a static ip when connecting through network-manager-gnome?
[05:18] <cynical> wd: some people dispute whether or not its faster. I personally noticed a big difference when I was using gentoo. Unfortunately it just takes too long to configure every single setting, so I decided not to deal with it :P
[05:18] <victorh> in ohter distros I change it in /etc/modprobe.conf
[05:18] <puneit> hi... I was upgrading from dapper to edgy and on restart X has failed to load...can anyone help
[05:19] <regeya> akijikan: I know mine got nuked on upgrade, and it better not happen again
[05:19] <victorh> but there is no such file in ubuntu
[05:19] <wd> cynical  ok.   i really see.  yeah after day 5 i quit on the minimal install.  lol
[05:19] <phI||Ip> how do I test to see if 3d is enabled?
[05:19] <Katsu|> How do I change language to Japanese?
[05:19] <teledyn> puneit: check the x server log for errors
[05:19] <puneit> teledyn: how do i do that
[05:19] <grndslm> cynical...definitely needed to use the default conf file, chmoded directory for luck, & smbpasswd
[05:20] <puneit> teledyn: I am kind of a novice
[05:20] <CientificoLoco> how do I accelerate my CD/DVD reader?
[05:20] <wd> cynical holycow  tritium   r u guys solely on linux or still dual booting
[05:20] <tritium> CientificoLoco: make sure dma is enabled
[05:20] <teledyn> puneit: logs are kept in /var/log/
[05:20] <tritium> wd: I have linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
[05:20] <CientificoLoco> dma tritium??
[05:20] <puneit> teledyn: ok...what do I need to see in the log and what can I do with it
[05:21] <teledyn> puneit: less <log file name>
[05:21] <regeya> puneit: make sure xserver-xorg is installed.  if it is, /etc/X11/xorg.conf probably got toasted.  you should have a backup in /etc/X11 tho.
[05:21] <tritium> !dma
[05:21] <ubotu> dma is Direct Memory Access/Addressing. It makes hard disks & optical drives transfer data faster, and is almost always enabled in Ubuntu 6.06. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DMA
[05:21] <CientificoLoco> tritium: how can I do tthat?
[05:21] <tritium> see baove
[05:21] <tritium> above even ;)
[05:21] <regeya> puneit:  also, if you're an ubuntu user, make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed, kubuntu-desktop if you're a kubuntu user...I had a fair amount of trouble with the upgrade meself.
[05:22] <puneit> regeya: I am an ubuntu user..
[05:22] <AdamKili> does ubuntu get fragmented like windows does? do i need to run a defragmenter?
[05:22] <regeya> puneit: the good news is that most the problems are pretty easy to fix
[05:22] <tritium> wd: and you?
[05:22] <puneit> regeya: Once I have located the backup file..what do I do
[05:22] <holycow> AdamKili, no, remember this: forget everything you learned on windows ... its wrong.
[05:22] <wd> tritium  by the way, how do i get that deleted linux partition which is showing up in xp as unallocated space back into my win partition anyway?
[05:23] <Kingsqueak> http://www.kingsqueak.org/stuff/tilt_cube.png   a rough Beryl screenshot if anyone was curious
[05:23] <regeya> AdamKili: the only time you'll run into major fragmentation is if you run out of storage space and delete/create a lot
[05:23] <regeya> AdamKili: I think the max I've had in the last few years is about 8% fragmentation...no, it's not a concern :-D
[05:23] <wd> tritium   well, winxp / linux  but edgy was very edgy on some apps, so deleted partitioned but i'm thinking about gong back right now.
[05:23] <tritium> wd: you could use gparted or qtparted to grow the windows partition, I believe
[05:23] <picasso> hi.. i just upgraded to 6.10 on my dell laptop (ati videocard) and now my xwindows wont load up
[05:23] <tritium> wd: going back to what?
[05:23] <AdamKili> regeya: where do i check my fragmentation?
[05:24] <picasso> anybody know what i can try?
[05:24] <regeya> AdamKili: it's not a concern, trust me :-D  you'd get a report if you have to run fsck manually at some point
[05:24] <Xiocide> Would anyone be willing to give me some help using Ubuntu's Live setup to fix my MBR?
[05:24] <holycow> just as a notice to anyone repartitioning IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO GROW/SHRINK NTFS PARTITIONS
[05:24] <holycow> unless your nicely backed up
[05:24] <Kingsqueak> I blew my XP up the last time I did that
[05:24] <Kingsqueak> worked for four systems, blew the install for one
[05:25] <tritium> holycow: your nicely backed up what?
[05:25] <AdamKili> i just want to check....my dad's wondering about it
[05:25] <wd> tritium ok. going back to ubuntu tonight. another try at it. i got frustrated about wine not supported for amd 64 and win 32 codecs and i read something about chroot then install codecs, oh my ,  head start spinning..lol
[05:25] <Kingsqueak> use partition magic or XP to shrink first to be sure
[05:25] <Xiocide> I reformatted a secondary drive, and now I get "error 17" from GRUB. I want to use Ubuntu to fix/repair my MBR so that my primary partition (XP) boots.
[05:25] <tritium> ah, holycow meant "you're", not "your"
[05:25] <picasso> "module ABI major version (0) doesn't match the server's version (1)"
[05:25] <tritium> wd: cool :)
[05:25] <picasso> does anyone know what causes tat error?
[05:25] <holycow> tritium, lol
[05:25] <holycow> :)
[05:25] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide you used the installer to shrink the part?
[05:25] <wd> holycow well in that case how can u get the parttion back if u delete the linux partiton?
[05:26] <lukeb> when I use beryl as my window manager, the borders to all my windows disappear
[05:26] <tritium> wd: if you want wine, stick with 32-bit to avoid frustration
[05:26] <lukeb> did i install it incorrectly?
[05:26] <holycow> picasso, grub cant find your kernel.  i forget what the fix is but theres a bunch of things on google for that.  i fixed it once but don't remember how
[05:26] <Xiocide> King: I have XP all alone on one drive. I had SuSE on a second IDE drive, but reformatted it to NTFS to store some DVDs on..
[05:26] <Kingsqueak> lukeb it probably crashed if you have no borders
[05:26] <lukeb> ic
[05:26] <wd> tritium so use dapper?
[05:26] <Xiocide> King: after that, when I reboot, I get that grub error; now I'm trying to get my maind rive to boot.
[05:26] <puneit> regeya: kindly tell me how to restore to the original xorg.conf
[05:26] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide ah, you just need to get the entries sorted out in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[05:26] <regeya> oh, um, puneit if you're in /etc/X11 you could just try to cp xorg.conf.whatevertheextensionis xorg.conf that's essentially what I did
[05:27] <picasso> hrm, holycow, any suggestion for google search terms?
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide try googling or the ubuntu wiki for that, there's a trick to it
[05:27] <puneit> regeya: thanks
[05:27] <elw> what the hell is a symbol in the context of the "strip" command?
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide has to do with 'hiding' and tricking XP to think it's on the first drive in the system
[05:27] <Xiocide> King: the only file in /boot/grub is device.map
[05:27] <regeya> puneit: patience.  I have a 1.5 year old in this house.  YOU tell her someone wants xorg.conf fixed right now plsthx :-)
[05:27] <AdamKili> is anyone else having trouble with the gDeslets official site? i can't download any desklets. are there other sites with desklets?
[05:27] <tritium> wd: you can use dapper or edgy.  your choice
[05:27] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide odd, so Grub is your boot loader right?
[05:27] <Xiocide> King: yes, well it was.
[05:27] <tritium> elw: calm down, amigo
[05:28] <chimpsky> anyone here have luck getting an nvidia 7900gs running?
[05:28] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide so when you boot you get nothing or just trouble with XP?
[05:28] <Xiocide> King: I get nothing. GRUB "loads" and then craps out saying "Error 17"
[05:29] <Kingsqueak> lukeb click on the ruby and tell it to restart beryl or use the window manager menu in there to re-select beryl, see if it starts up again
[05:29] <puneit> regeya: I have done that...let me now restart and see if it works..thanks a lot... i will log back in if it doesn't work...
[05:29] <astx813> OK, on average, how many people are having 'easy' upgrades from Dapper?
[05:29] <CientificoLoco> tritium: sorry can you pass me the site again I had to reboot my laptop becouse for cause od my CD reader
[05:29] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide ah ok, you need a 'install Grub HOWTO' then
[05:29] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, it just reverts to compiz (which incidentalyl doesnt have window borders either)
[05:29] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide pretty sure I've seen that all mapped out on the wiki
[05:29] <Xiocide> King: what if I want to remove GRUB? (since I only have XP now)
[05:29] <Kingsqueak> lukeb ah, not sure there, you enabled glx in xorg.conf right?
[05:30] <wd> tritium  kde uses more resources right?  i mean gnome is simple  but my box keeps slowing down after a few apps are installed. i'm thinking about something lite, fluxbox, but doesn't play nice with nautilus, at least it didn't.
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> lukeb just to check, you have nvidia or ati for a card right?
[05:30] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, Nvidia - im pretty sure its enabled ill check
[05:30] <ubuntu_newb> I love ubuntu, it was so easy to set up a web server on my ubuntu machine
[05:30] <ubuntu_newb> I don't even have the server edition
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide ah, you need to run the Windows mbr thing to fix that, I'm totally not sure what the command is
[05:30] <wd> ubuntu_newb was that hard?
[05:30] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide you fix that with a util on Win install media though
[05:30] <Xiocide> King: it's fixmbr but I dont have an XP disc
[05:30] <ubuntu_newb> no, I downloaded a file and it installed and configured everything
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> lukeb go through the howto for installing/configuring Beryl on the Ubuntu wiki
[05:31] <CorpseFeeder> if I click on the "audio" tab in winecfg it crashes with error "ALSA lib seq_hw.c:457:(snd_seq_hw_open) open /dev/snd/seq failed: No such file or directory" - what do I need to do to fix this?
[05:31] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, yeah thats how I installed it
[05:31] <astx813> I've got ndiswrapper, and it works if I do modprobe ndiswrapper, but it's not coming up on its own when I reboot (yes, I've tried ndiswrapper -m)
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide k, well you could try installing Grub and just using that to chain load XP
[05:31] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, xorg.conf does say Load           "glx"
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide just use the live cd and follow one of the howtos for installing GRUB
[05:31] <ubuntu_newb> you can see that my server is up at http://act.homelinux.com
[05:31] <Kingsqueak> lukeb you disabled dri and glcore too right?
[05:32] <wd> ubuntu_newb web server as in ur own website box kept at home for ur website? or a like a fileserver for multiple computers at home to save files on?
[05:32] <Xiocide> King: any certain howto you'd recommend?
[05:32] <wd> ubuntu_newb  i'm going there now.
[05:32] <ubuntu_newb> it's a full featured apache webserver with php mysql etc...
[05:32] <Kingsqueak> lukeb err not glcore, but comment out dri
[05:32] <ubuntu_newb> I'm using it for testing purposes
[05:32] <h3htimo> could someone explain to me why mesa keeps installing when i use this?? http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide
[05:33] <Kingsqueak> Xiocide not specifically, just look for any general how to install GRUB and just keep in mind that the root(0,0) drive declarations are to point at your XP drive
[05:33] <Xiocide> King: ok thanks
[05:33] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, its not even there. ill try restarting the PC brb
[05:33] <astx813> I'd rather avoid ndiswrapper, but as far as I know it's mandatory for Broadcom chips
[05:33] <wd> ubuntu_newb having a hard time loading page
[05:34] <lnxmacusr> testing
=== zonum_ is now known as zonum
[05:34] <ubuntu_newb> there is no page
[05:34] <ubuntu_newb> it will just bring you to a directory
[05:35] <wd> ubuntu_newb  i'll keep trying
[05:35] <ubuntu_newb> http://act.homelinux.com
[05:35] <ubuntu_newb> that is the address to my server.
[05:35] <grndslm> ubuntu_newb...definitely no directory
[05:35] <rredd4> i just installed edgy, it installed the generic kernel.  I need to install ndiswrapper, in the past, i had to have the 686 kernel.   Will ndiswrapper work with the generic kernel?
[05:36] <ubuntu_newb> hmm...
[05:36] <astx813> rredd4: Yeah, the generic stands in nicely for 686
[05:36] <ubuntu_newb> here is the package I used to make my ubuntu a web server...
[05:36] <ubuntu_newb> http://seveas.imbrandon.com/pool/edgy-seveas/seveas-meta/ubuntu-lamp_6.10-2_all.deb
[05:36] <wd> ubuntu_newb thanks
[05:36] <ubuntu_newb> use that link to download the ubuntu package
[05:36] <rein> hi anybody know how I can get a ati card to use graphics accel?
[05:36] <ubuntu_newb> just run the package and it will install/configure your server
[05:36] <rredd4> astx813  ok, guess i will try... ty
[05:37] <ubuntu_newb> it will install apache2 php5 and mysql 5
[05:37] <amy__>  /server gimpnet
[05:37] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, it worked - all it needed was a reboot hehe
[05:37] <Kingsqueak> cool
[05:37] <rein> I have fglrx install
[05:37] <grndslm> ubuntu_newb...you either need to refresh dyndns's record of your ip...and/or forward port 80 requests from your router to your server's local ip (i.e. - 192.168.1.123)
[05:37] <ubuntu_newb> yeah I did that but perhaps my ip changed on this computer
[05:37] <Kingsqueak> lukeb the module loading is a bit weird at times on boot, I put gdm in to start at level 90 in inits and it helped quite a lot
[05:37] <ubuntu_newb> how can I see my ip on ubuntu?
[05:38] <ubuntu_newb> local ip that is
[05:38] <surekha> Can someone help me setting up SSI on apache2 on ubuntu dapper?
[05:38] <grndslm> ifconfig
[05:38] <sparr> ifconfig
[05:38] <Kingsqueak> lukeb if that means nothing to you, just ignore it ;-)
[05:38] <ubuntu_newb> thanks
[05:38] <surekha> I tried everything mentioned in this site https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerSideIncludes
[05:38] <surekha> but no luck
[05:38] <grndslm> ubuntu_newb, if you want a static ip on your local ip....you need to set it in /etc/network/interfaces
[05:38] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, consider it ignored :D
[05:38] <firebird619> I have Edgy installed. My graphics are built-in Intel i810. In Synaptic, both xserver-xorg-video-i810 and xserver-xorg-video-i740 packages are installed. Should the xserver-xorg-video-i740 package be installed?
[05:39] <rredd4> astx813  when i want to install nvidia glx, it also wants to install the 386 kernel, which i don't want.  What do i do please?
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> lukeb Beryl tip, hit your mouse cursor in each corner, try it with multiple things open on multiple desktops
[05:39] <MoRpHeUz> hi guys...I'm having an interesting problem on a notebook with dual core processor. The kernel is already compiled with SMP but "cat /proc/cpuinfo" keeps showing only one core...do you have any ideas where can be the problem ?
[05:39] <wd> tritium what do u recom. for a speedy ubuntu? fluxbox or xfce?
[05:39] <astx813> rredd4: dunno, haven't gotten that far
[05:39] <lukeb> Kingsqueak, holy crap thats awesome
[05:39] <Kingsqueak> lukeb ctrl-alt- arrow keys too
[05:40] <Emess> is there a way to set wine to act as xp in its look, or even the kde and beryl theme im using?
[05:40] <elw> how do you list all the channels?
[05:40] <Kingsqueak> lukeb ctrl-alt click and drag with left mouse button too
[05:40] <astx813> Is anyone having luck with a broadcom wi-fi chipset?
[05:40] <bimberi> firebird619: it just means that the driver is available, not necessarily used.
[05:40] <Emess> probably the best feature of beryl si ont eh edge fo teh screen the windows list
[05:40] <Kingsqueak> Emess , windows list?
[05:41] <bimberi> !broadcom
[05:41] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[05:41] <CorpseFeeder> winecfg crashes when I click the audio tab. "ALSA lib seq_hw.c:457: (snd_seq_hw_open) open /dev/snd/seq failed: No such file or directory" and also "Error: "/home/name/.kde/socket-name-desktop" is not a link or a directory."
[05:41] <grndslm> ubuntu_newb, this is exactly what you need to do to setup a static ip on your local lan: http://pastebin.ca/233850
[05:41] <Emess> it shows allt eh windows spread over it to select
[05:41] <firebird619> bimberi: It is acually installed though?
[05:41] <picasso> Ok. According to ubuntuforums, I need to install package xserver-org-video-all to get my video drivers (newly upgraded 6.10) ... however apt-cache search xserver-org-video doesn't find anything
[05:41] <Kingsqueak> Emess ah  ctrl-alt-d  ?
[05:41] <grndslm> ubuntu_newb, just make sure to set your ip outside the range of dhcp on your router
[05:41] <rredd4> has anyone install nvidia glx in edgy?  i want to use the generic kernel.  But the nvidia glx install also wants me to install the 386 kernel.  What do i do?
[05:41] <Kingsqueak> Emess err  ctrl-alt-spcbar
[05:41] <picasso> anyone know why i couldnt find xserver-org-video-all or xserver-org-video-ati packages?
[05:41] <bimberi> firebird619: yes, the package and its files are installed, the driver wouldn't be in use though.  That package is installed on my system and I have nvidia
[05:42] <elw> hOw Do YoU list all of the channels?
[05:42] <rredd4> "/list"
[05:42] <Emess> Kingsqueak: ctrl-alt-d? ctrl-alt-spcbr? they didnt do anything...
[05:42] <rredd4> no quotes
[05:42] <bigslam> ./list yea:P
[05:42] <Kingsqueak> elw  /list  but it's huge , do   /list something to search for
[05:42] <bigslam> ./list linux
[05:42] <grndslm> elw, you can't list all the channels on freenode...go to searchirc.com or something like that
[05:42] <elw> odd, its not working for me
[05:43] <bigslam> yea you can
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> Emess ah? 'd' was a mistake but ctrl-alt-space  should flatten all your desktops
[05:43] <bigslam> it depends on the server
[05:43] <GaiaX11> Suppose  I am doing a dist-upgrade and the light is off. Will my system break?
[05:43] <grndslm> nope...searchirc.com
[05:43] <firebird619> bimberi: I was just wondering because I have been having problems with Ubuntu, something with gdm and drivers.
[05:43] <bigslam> the leaf
[05:43] <Kingsqueak> Emess maybe different versions of Beryl
[05:43] <Music_Shuffle> GaiaX11: Which light...?
[05:43] <chimpsky> GaiaX11: are you running under windows with the shades up?
[05:43] <elw> hey, what does this code do ? ":(){ :|:& };:"
[05:44] <GaiaX11> Music_Shuffle: I mean the electric energy
[05:44] <Emess> Kingsqueak: desktops being the faces of the cube? i used to have 6 virtuals but now im limited to 4 :(
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> GaiaX11 if you mean the power goes out, yeah it could be a problem for sure
[05:44] <CorpseFeeder> /list with no .
[05:44] <bimberi> elw: it's a fork bomb, don't paste it again please
[05:44] <Music_Shuffle> GaiaX11: Ouch. ./Sympathy.
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> Emess yup
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> Emess you probably have it, but mapped to different keys than I do
[05:44] <bruenig> 6 virtuals, my god, for what purpose?
[05:44] <Emess> also, does nayone know how to make beryl display on ehte windows on the current cube face on that faces taskbar instead of every window?
[05:44] <Music_Shuffle> Don't cubes usually have 6 faces? Sounds like a good enough purpose to having 6. :P
[05:44] <Kingsqueak> Emess top right corner with mouse cursor
[05:44] <Emess> ctrl-alt-d dpoes it for me lol
[05:45] <Emess> Kingsqueak: that works on all corners
[05:45] <picasso> hooray, it works, i typed xserver-xorg-video-all wrong (xserver-org-video-all)
[05:45] <Emess> i knew that one alrady
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> Emess it's different in each corner on mine
[05:45] <CorpseFeeder> how do I stop winecfg from crashing?
[05:45] <Emess> what should it do in each corner?
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> Emess lower right is clear, upper is expose current, lower left is expose all open apps
[05:45] <Kingsqueak> I forget what upper left is
[05:45] <Keyseir> Where do I go to check what hardware I have connected? Ubuntu Dapper
[05:46] <GaiaX11> Kingsqueak: But, can i start from where it stopped?
[05:46] <leofender> hi
[05:46] <Emess> Kingsqueak: theyr allt eh same for me
[05:46] <leofender> hi to all
[05:46] <gib_> Is there a hack that will allow transparent endcaps on panels in Gnome?
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> GaiaX11 not likely, I would STRONGLY recommend you don't do an upgrade with an unstable connection or power issue
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> Emess ah, odd
[05:46] <Kingsqueak> Emess F-keys maybe?
[05:46] <CorpseFeeder> is there a separate channel on here for wine specific help?
[05:46] <leofender> you know some linux game for play on line ?
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> F10 F11 F12 etc
[05:47] <Keyseir> How do I see what hardware I have connected?
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir what type?
[05:47] <Keyseir> I'm looking for specs on my dvd burner
[05:47] <Keyseir> so, media drives
[05:47] <Emess> F8 does teh same as corner
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> try cdrecord -inq driveropts=drivequery  I think
[05:48] <chapium> keyseir google the model #
[05:48] <leofender> play some linux game ?
[05:48] <noxxle> im trying to share a folder with a windows xp system on my network. however when my friend tries to access my folder it asks him for a username and pass. WTF
[05:48] <h3htimo> why do i keep getting the mesa driver and not ati whenever i do an fglrxinfo???
[05:48] <leofender> hii!
[05:49] <zenmonk> question, i am trying to set up the script listed here: http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/h/797 does anyone know how?
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir that get you what you wanted?
[05:49] <Keyseir> I think it did
[05:49] <Keyseir> Thanks Kingsqueak
[05:49] <Gex> noxxle: i've had that problem. usually just hit enter and you're fine.
[05:49] <Kingsqueak> also 'dmesg' and kern.log or boot.log in /var/log/messages
[05:49] <noxxle> i cannot hit enter
[05:49] <leofender> i need help please
[05:49] <noxxle> the login button doesnt allow unless i have a name
[05:50] <leofender> im new in linux
[05:50] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir if you want to know if cdrecord sees the drive    cdrecord --scanbus    if it shows there, it's likely good to go
[05:50] <CorpseFeeder> winecfg - it crashes. I can find lots of threads on forums about this crashing when you click audio tab, but every forum thread seems to get a different error to the one I am getting. help!
[05:50] <CorpseFeeder> if I search for my specific error, I get no search results ;(
[05:50] <h3htimo> is mesa the default video driver with fglrx?? can you change it to ati??
[05:50] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: I'm just trying to find the write speed my drive. I think the ID is all I need to google
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir cdrecord is smart about that generally if you just don't give a speed= option
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir it will default to whatever the media and drive can handle well
[05:51] <Gex> noxxle: try using your linux login and pass
[05:51] <leofender> hi
[05:51] <leofender> hi or hola!
[05:51] <leofender> i m from argentina
[05:52] <Some_Dude> so, um... hi, everyone
[05:52] <Keyseir> kingsqueak: I don't think cdrecord is working properly, says it has problems with my kernel version.
[05:52] <Kingsqueak> k
[05:52] <Keyseir> kingsqueak: cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open '/dev/pg*'. Cannot open SCSI driver.
[05:52] <leofender> ok
[05:52] <Keyseir> kingsqueak: Is that easy to fix..?
[05:52] <leofender> hi
[05:52] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir in dmesg does the drive show as a scsi drive or as say /dev/hdc ?
[05:52] <leofender> i need a free game linux for playing on line
[05:52] <astx813> Off topic, forgive me.  Is anyone else watching Stephen Colbert?
[05:53] <Some_Dude> I just tried to upgrade to Edgy Eft and I can't seem to get anything to work anymore ... does anybody here know what unifont is and why APT wants to get rid of it?
[05:53] <leofender> i need a free linux game
[05:53] <Kingsqueak> leofender xfrisk
[05:53] <Kingsqueak> heh
[05:53] <Keyseir> Kingsqeuak: I just typed dmesg and I don't understand all the output. What do I need to look at?
[05:53] <leofender> example: counter strike linux version
[05:53] <leofender> xfrisk ? what is this ?
[05:53] <h3htimo> alright, please can anyone help, what is xorg's default video driver, and what should i get after installing fglrx... and what should i do if i dont get that???
[05:53] <Some_Dude> I feel dirty having to use a Windows IRC client
[05:54] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir try   dmesg | less    then do  /CDROM   it will go to the line where it sees it
[05:54] <epp> h3htimo, isnt it VESA?
[05:54] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir should say shortly after setting up  scd or something like hdc for the device
[05:54] <h3htimo> epp, it says mesa whenever i do a fglrxinfo
[05:54] <leofender> please i need help because i m new in linux
[05:54] <h3htimo> i thought it was supposed to say ati
[05:54] <epp> yeah. its mesa. So you have ati?
[05:54] <Keyseir> kingsqueak: Pattern not found for /CDROM
[05:55] <Some_Dude> is there a way to run apt-get upgrade and ignore a package that refuses to be deleted?
[05:55] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir yeah sorry, just do  /CD
[05:55] <Keyseir> kingsqueak; k
[05:55] <epp> h3htimo, hold on
[05:55] <Kingsqueak> if that doesn't put you there, just type / again for the next entry of CD
[05:55] <h3htimo> epp, ok
[05:55] <Some_Dude> anybody...?
[05:55] <Milchmann> leofender, do you by any chance speak german?

[05:55] <Keyseir> [17179576.436000]  hdd: _NEC DVD_RW ND-2500A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> Some_Dude you could try a -f
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir you have two drives it seems
[05:56] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: COrrecto. I believe only one was supposed to be DVD tho
[05:56] <leofender> oh no. :( i m speak spanish and some english
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir which one do you want to work?
[05:56] <Kingsqueak> the DVD burner seems to be hdd
[05:56] <Some_Dude> Kingsqueak, I tried that ... the computer wants to remove a package called unifont and unifont returns an error when the thing tries to remove it
[05:56] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: THe dvd one. However, I believe everything is working. I was just looking for the DVD burning speed.
[05:56] <Keyseir> kingsqueak: [17179576.564000]   hdb1 hdb2 <<6>hdd: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM DVD-R CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
[05:57] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: How do I find the burning speed for the DVD-ROM?
[05:57] <Kingsqueak> there you go 40X likely for CD probably 8x or so for DVD
[05:58] <Keyseir> I'm trying to see if I should just buy 8x DVDs or if I could benefit from 16x. Is there a way to check this speed locally, or should I just google the model number?
[05:58] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir I'm googling it now
[05:58] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: Well thanks then mang

[05:58] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir here you go  http://www.itreviews.co.uk/hardware/h550.htm
[05:59] <leofender> whats "xfrisk" ??
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir looks like 8x
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> leofender it's networked risk
[05:59] <epp> h3htimo, did you follow the guide?
[05:59] <Kingsqueak> leofender you have to start up the server on at least one box then people can connect to play risk
[05:59] <h3htimo> epp, yeah
[06:00] <ubuntu_newb> http://act.homelinux.com
[06:00] <Some_Dude> leofender:  http://tuxick.net/xfrisk
[06:00] <h3htimo> epp, i think i did it exactly, i think i used copy and paste for everything
[06:00] <leofender> aaah
[06:00] <ubuntu_newb> could someone please check that for me again?
[06:00] <Kingsqueak> leofender it's pretty fun actually, just old school
[06:00] <Milchmann> leofender, i got a nice webpage for linux gaming, but its german. but they do have some link for english pages, i just havent checked them yet
[06:00] <leofender> thanks i will in there
[06:00] <Arrick> Seveas, you here tonight?
[06:00] <epp> h3htimo, was it this http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide#Installing_the_driver?
[06:00] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: THanks mang
[06:01] <Gex> ubuntu_newb: it works. i see a dir tree
[06:01] <h3htimo> epp, yup
[06:01] <epp> hmmm
[06:01] <h3htimo> when i do fglrxinfo i get mesa
[06:01] <epp> h3htimo, did you restart?
[06:01] <h3htimo> yup
[06:01] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir looks like you have a good drive, also with cdrecord you may need to do   dev=/dev/hdd
[06:01] <stylus> my websites and such are resolving really slowly now that i'm over on ubuntu. why is this and how could i fix it?
[06:01] <epp> try this again
[06:01] <h3htimo> epp, try the regular way??
[06:01] <epp> h3htimo, sudo depmod -a
[06:01] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir or in the kernel boot like    hdd=ide-scsi   to make it come up as an ide scsi device
[06:02] <noxxle> im trying to share a folder with a windows computer on my network. However when i try to access the folder on my linux computer it asks for a username /pass.
[06:02] <h3htimo> epp, alright
[06:02] <noxxle> should i be using samba?
[06:02] <epp> h3htimo,  then sudo aticonfig --initial
[06:02] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir if it works with   dev=/dev/hdd   for cdrecord, don't bother with the kernel option
[06:02] <epp> h3htimo,  then sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
[06:02] <Milchmann> noxxle, yes. i do the same here with samba
[06:02] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: Where do I go to do this?
[06:02] <Milchmann> noxxle, and i use the windows username & password to access the windows share
[06:03] <noxxle> yea but what is the user name and pass?
[06:03] <noxxle> i tried everything
[06:03] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir the ide-scsi thing?  You put that in the kernel boot line in the GRUB setup, try using  dev=/dev/hdd first though
[06:03] <Milchmann> if the share is on the windows computer then you need the windows username & password
[06:03] <alpha255> smbpasswd ?
[06:04] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: I was referring to the dev=/dev/hdd thing
[06:04] <noxxle> no the share is on my linux pc
[06:04] <noxxle> i dont have a samba pass
[06:04] <noxxle> that i know of
[06:04] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: Where do I put that "dev=/dev/hdd"
[06:04] <Milchmann> ah ok, i've done it the other way
[06:04] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: Oh, cdrecord.
[06:04] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir that's for commandline cdrecord
[06:04] <Gex> noxxle: have you tried your linux username and pass?
[06:04] <alpha255> sudo smbpasswd -a  i think
[06:04] <h3htimo> epp, done
[06:04] <noxxle> gex that was the first thing i tried
[06:04] <mardi_soir> hello i have a problem http://pastebin.ca/233862
[06:04] <noxxle> no luck
[06:04] <noxxle> just re asks me
[06:05] <leofender> how can i know more about linux...?
[06:05] <mardi_soir> but no watchdog is selected
[06:05] <Kingsqueak> Keyseir    cdrecord -vvv dev=/dev/hdd driveropts=burnfree foo.iso
[06:05] <epp> h3htimo, now run sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for "ati" then replace it with "fglrx"
[06:05] <alpha255> noxxle, samba.org has terptstra's book there for you to read
[06:05] <alpha255> noxxle, it is really really good
[06:05] <noxxle> what!?!?! WHY doesnt it just let me connect
[06:05] <noxxle> it shouldnt be this hard
[06:05] <Milchmann> leofender go to http://www.ubuntu.com and read ;)
[06:06] <alpha255> noxxle, linux passwords and smb passwords are different
[06:06] <noxxle> i can see the folder on my windows computer. thi sis ridiculus
[06:06] <leofender> hahaha
[06:06] <leofender> thanks
[06:06] <noxxle> how do i set an smb pass
[06:06] <leofender> im argentino ;) :P
[06:06] <leofender> lol
[06:06] <leofender> thanks
[06:06] <alpha255> sudo smbpasswd -a  i think
[06:06] <leofender> i will read
[06:06] <Keyseir> Kingsqueak: So I use that format whenever I burn something, where "foo.iso" is the directory I'm burning?
[06:06] <noxxle> isnt there a gui
[06:06] <h3htimo> epp, there is no just "ati"
[06:06] <alpha255> noxxle, the smb.conf file is where quite a bit of the configuration is done
[06:07] <AlanHaggai> cynical : Hi :). Is there any software development IDE in Ubuntu. I need to make some applications.
[06:07] <alpha255> noxxle, also check out swat ... it's a web based interface for configuring smb
[06:07] <epp> k hold on, i dont have my laptop that has ati or this would be easier
[06:07] <noxxle> ok how do i set an smb user?
[06:07] <h3htimo> epp, alright
[06:07] <alpha255> noxxle, usullay runs on localhost
[06:07] <alpha255> sudo smbpasswd -a  i think
[06:07] <alpha255> noxxle, sudo smbpasswd -a  i think
[06:08] <Natural_High> hey, anyone know how to disable the autologout?
[06:08] <AlanHaggai> Hi friends. Is there any software development IDE in Ubuntu. I need to make some applications.
[06:08] <Natural_High> Alan, check the synaptic package manager for them
[06:08] <Natural_High> there are plenty
[06:08] <alpha255> noxxle, -a     This option specifies that  the  username  following  should  be added  to  the local smbpasswd file
[06:08] <epp> h3htimo, look for 'Section "Device"'
[06:08] <alpha255> noxxle, man smbpasswd
[06:08] <AlanHaggai> Natural_High : What name should I search for?
[06:09] <Natural_High> what language do you want to program in?
[06:09] <Natural_High> and you can search the description of the IDE for it anyway
[06:09] <h3htimo> epp, okay i found it
[06:09] <AlanHaggai> Natural_High : Which all languages are available?
[06:09] <ubuntu_newb> The only open port on my computer is 80, is that all that should be open for Apache, php, and mysql to work properly with a site?
[06:09] <mardi_soir> no idea ?
[06:09] <alpha255> blankin python on the blanking plane! that's the program language ;)
[06:09] <epp> h3htimo,  what does it list under driver?
[06:10] <Arrick> anybody here want to tackle a pastebot project tonight?
[06:10] <Natural_High> Alan: ... can you program in a language?
[06:10] <AlanHaggai> Natural_High : yes
[06:10] <h3htimo> epp, fglrx
[06:10] <AlanHaggai> Natural_High : I used to do in VB
[06:10] <epp> h3h, k hold on
[06:11] <epp> h3h. add this to the end Section "Extensions"
[06:11] <epp>         Option  "Composite" "0"
[06:11] <epp> EndSection
[06:12] <epp> h3htimo, add this to the end
[06:12] <epp> Section "Extensions"
[06:12] <epp>         Option  "Composite" "0"
[06:12] <epp> EndSection
[06:12] <luckyone> hello, I am trying to play an iso of a dvd I made using vlc and it is seg faulting
[06:12] <h3htimo> epp, did that
[06:12] <luckyone> can anyone help?
[06:12] <epp> h3htimo, now restart and check it again
[06:13] <h3htimo> epp, alright brb
[06:13] <Natural_High> Can anyone tell me how to disable the autologout? which file to edit? anything?
[06:14] <Some_Dude> okay, so... I've determined that unifont is merely a font and what is happening is that dpkg needs to remove this font before it does anything else and it invokes update-fonts-dir in a way that makes update-fonts-dir return an error
[06:14] <Some_Dude> what should I do?
[06:14] <bun-bun> didn't 6.06 install postfix by default?
[06:15] <Aji-Dahaka> blist online
[06:15] <Aji-Dahaka> oops, sorry
[06:16] <Natural_High> still need help on that autologout...
[06:16] <h3htimo> epp, did it, same results
[06:16] <epp> h3htimo, what card do you have?
[06:17] <h3htimo> epp, an ati radeon x1600
[06:17] <h3htimo> epp, the driver worked perfectly in dapper
[06:18] <epp> h3htimo, nothing comes to mind as a fix. you might want to report a bug
[06:18] <kronoman> good night
[06:19] <h3htimo> epp, well, like my screen looks like it did before.. i just cant play games that require open gl
[06:20] <epp> h3htimo, yeah. Try method two of installing the drivers.
[06:20] <epp> its more complex but it has the newer ones.
[06:20] <h3htimo> i did
[06:21] <h3htimo> same result
[06:21] <h3htimo> im just gonna deal with it... i can use windows for games
[06:21] <epp> h3htimo, but i gtg, school tomorrow. peace
[06:21] <h3htimo> later
[06:21] <epp> yeah, pace
[06:21] <kronoman> simple question : how I find broken symlinks ?
[06:21] <lostboyz> hello when i try to start xorg it crashes and says ati driver not able to load
[06:21] <lostboyz> i just upgraded to edgy
[06:21] <regeya> so, if I understand right, up until this week edgy was equivalent to debian unstable; now it's equivalent to debian testing.  up until this week tho there wasn't an equivalent to testing, just stable and unstable.  aye?
[06:21] <CppIsWeird> i've been doing some reading about a remote desktoping solution for linux. And i've gathered that there is some way to get X11 to output to a remote location the instance for a user. Kinda like RDP for windows.
[06:22] <MrKeuner> hi, which package do I need for reading/writing xls files in Gnumeric?
[06:22] <CppIsWeird> can anyone tell me more about this to point me in the right direction?
[06:22] <kronoman> CppIsWeird: yes, you are right, you can connect remotely to X11
[06:22] <CppIsWeird> im a heavy windows user and im a bit lost
[06:23] <regeya> lostboys: welcome to ubuntu unstable!
[06:23] <kronoman> CppIsWeird: maybe this will help, http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/January2002/article222.shtml
[06:24] <kronoman> is a bit dated
[06:24] <CppIsWeird> i toyed with VNC a bit, but we have a strong need for mutiple instances of users logged into the box at the same time.
[06:24] <CppIsWeird> is that achieveable with this X11 approach?
[06:25] <lostboyz> hello when i start xserver it says ati not able to load module mismatch what does that mean
[06:25] <kronoman> CppIsWeird: check the menu System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop.
[06:25] <kronoman> CppIsWeird: yes, you should be able to login many users to the same machine
[06:25] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird basically you run Cygwin on windows as the X server, then run the X session or app on the remote linux box and display it back to the X server on the Win box
[06:25] <kronoman> CppIsWeird: search for ubuntu and vnc in google to find more
[06:26] <kronoman> now, to my question, anybody knows a way to find broken symlinks in a directory tree using the console ?
[06:26] <whyameye> CppIsWeird: don't know if this is exactly what you want...but I ssh -X into linux machines all the time, logging into my acct. then running X apps.
[06:26] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird or use Hummingbird Xceed on the Win boxes, but that has licensing costs
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[06:27] <gameover> hi...
[06:27] <gameover> i want to install openmosix on ubuntu cluster
[06:27] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/exceed/
[06:27] <gameover> someone know how?
[06:28] <CppIsWeird> "Network speed is of course an issue here but a normal 10Mbit/s LAN connection is more than enough." - How about over the internet access?
[06:28] <gameover> Some guide to install openmosix?
[06:29] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird over the internet, you would really only want to run one app at a time, not a full desktop session
[06:29] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird using X forwarding via ssh to the remote is better, you still need a local X server running/installed though on the Win client
[06:29] <whyameye> CppIsWeird: I think you will get better performance remotely logging in then running your X apps, in comparison to vnc.
[06:29] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird what is the specific application need, maybe I can help with better suggestions
[06:30] <duncanm> another else using compiz (not beryl) on edgy?
[06:30] <whyameye> CppIsWeird: cygwin/x is a nice x server for Windows and you can run your linux apps from a remote machine in X this way.
[06:31] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird basically, what are they actually doing once logged in?
[06:31] <duncanm> i keep on seeing this in my .xsession-errors
[06:31] <duncanm> shift: 96: can't shift that many
[06:32] <MrKeuner> duncanm: is it possible without any outside repositories?
[06:32] <duncanm> http://lunapark6.com/?p=2501
[06:32] <duncanm> MrKeuner: that's the site where i got the instructions
[06:33] <CorpseFeeder> whats the command to remove non-empty directories? rmdir doesn't seem to be able to handle non-empty directories...
[06:33] <duncanm> CorpseFeeder: rm -rf
[06:33] <GreenEggsAndSpam> CorpseFeeder, rm -rf
[06:33] <CorpseFeeder> ok
[06:34] <MrKeuner> duncanm: yes they are using outside repositories
[06:34] <duncanm> MrKeuner: uh huh
[06:34] <kronoman> any way of opening CorelDraw files with some Ubuntu app ??
[06:34] <amir> hey everyone
[06:35] <amir> Is there anyway to reset ubuntu to a clean install?
[06:35] <CppIsWeird> sorry, i have been reading the article. The specific application i need: i am used to RDPing our windows server, and developing the web applications, configuring softwaer, and administering things in general. We have made a note to use cross platform mediums like apache, php, mysql, etc. So the administration should be the same, just not sure on how to access the box remotely.
[06:35] <Kingsqueak> amir ?  Just re-install?
[06:35] <amir> using the CD?
[06:36] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird ohhh, have you tried 'rdesktop' ?
[06:36] <CppIsWeird> we are trying to adapt to linux for cost, and efficency. Windows is bloated.
[06:36] <amir> Kingsqueak, no way to do it just through the desktop?
[06:36] <CppIsWeird> rdesktop as i understood it was a CLIENT for a windows server
[06:36] <Kingsqueak> amir not really besides deleting what you've installed manually
[06:36] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird o.k. so you want an alternative to Win
[06:36] <amir> ugh, alright then
[06:36] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird you realize that most linux tasks don't need GUI right?
[06:37] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird meaning all you need is ssh access to a system
[06:37] <amir> Well thanks anyways Kingsqueak
[06:37] <CppIsWeird> well. i dont wanna sound like im trying to make linux windows, but beings as this swtich is now putting us behind, yes. I just want "My Desktop" from home.
[06:37] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird if you had to fire up a GUI app, run an X server on the client end, and use ssh X forwarding
[06:37] <blazemonger> is there a prog for linx that automatically adjusts your monitor's display geometry
[06:37] <Natural_High> hey, can anyone help me with disabling the autologout?
[06:37] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird a full desktop in linux is just unnecessary is all
[06:38] <CppIsWeird> ok.
[06:38] <kronoman> a question: were all the screensaver options went in 6.06 ? my old ubuntu had more options for the screensaver...
[06:38] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird so cygwin/x is the free way to a Win X server
[06:38] <CppIsWeird> ok, yes, i have installed cygwin.
[06:38] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird then enable X forwarding in sshd_config on the server end and when you ssh -X to that server, you can run any GUI app and it will display back if your ports are open
[06:39] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird use the cygwin ssh too, it will likely handle the forwarding better
[06:39] <CppIsWeird> ok, one sec.
[06:39] <Kingsqueak> CppIsWeird quick test is fire up cygwin x , ssh -X to the server, and run 'xterm'
=== Wicked_ is now known as Wicked
[06:40] <Kingsqueak> cygwin/x needs to be tweaked though as it isn't open for connections on the network by default
[06:40] <Kingsqueak> it only listens on loopback
[06:40] <Kingsqueak> I forget where to fix that, I almost never use Windows
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> actually, don't mind me, ssh will tunnel back and take care of that
[06:41] <leofender> hiii
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> you only need to do that for plain X connections
[06:41] <bun-bun> does anyone get noticeable delays resolving dns queries?
[06:41] <leofender> whats bash and perl ??
[06:41] <leofender> im new in linux
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> leofender bash is a shell, your commandline
[06:41] <leofender> okey
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> leofender perl is a programming language, scripting/interpreted sort
[06:41] <leofender> can i create a script with bash ?
[06:42] <Kingsqueak> you can make scripts with both of them
[06:42] <leofender> okey
[06:42] <Kingsqueak> simple scripts with bash, crazy scripts and full applications with perl
[06:42] <siccness> theres a million guides on the net for bash scripting
[06:42] <Kingsqueak> the Bash-HOWTO on tldp.org is great
[06:42] <leofender> i will go to read the linux bible as know more
[06:43] <leofender> yeahh! perl so is the best scripts creator
[06:43] <leofender> :P
[06:43] <leofender> jajaja
[06:43] <Kingsqueak> leofender http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html
[06:43] <leofender> thanks Kingdqueak
[06:43] <leofender> Kings/
[06:44] <Kingsqueak> it's not just for beginners that doc either ;-)
[06:44] <CppIsWeird> hmm, i dont have access to the server right now. VNC was turned off.
[06:44] <leofender> any day i will be a drives creator and a expert on linux.
[06:44] <leofender> i wish that
[06:44] <leofender> haha
[06:45] <gustavol1> can someone help me with compiz ?
[06:45] <leofender> okey!
[06:45] <gustavol1> I cant start compiz
[06:45] <leofender> bye bye!!
[06:45] <leofender> thanks for all!

[06:46] <alpha255> neo2ubuntu, do you have a cd?
[06:46] <Chippy> tritium: thanks :)
[06:46] <knapper> Hey guys, I just recently upgraded to edgy and am having some (a lot) of trouble. For one, video playback is very ugly. The avi I am playing played fine before I upgraded and now it doesn't play in any media player but mplayer and gxine and looks terrible. Any ideas?
[06:47] <tritium> Chippy: :)
[06:47] <neo2ubuntu> my cd is currputted I think...i frezzes up on step 6 copying files at 49%...is there a work around that can fix this?
[06:47] <Ademan> i tried to install the k3d package and i'm pretty sure it broke apt, not beyond repair, i just hafta work some magic
[06:47] <Ademan> but i wanna know what
[06:47] <Ademan> the post-installation script failed for k3d, and when i try and uninstall k3d it keeps wanting to run the post-installation script BEFORE it runs the uninstall script
[06:47] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: Do you know how I can solve me problem?
[06:48] <neo2ubuntu> oops
[06:48] <amir> are there any differences in operating kubuntu, xubuntu, and ubuntu?
[06:48] <amir> or do they function the same
[06:48] <cudaman73> amir: only the DE
[06:48] <neo2ubuntu> where can I go to get one on one help for Ubuntu installation?
[06:48] <amir> DE?
[06:48] <Ademan> amir: they function internally the same, but they have different graphical frontends (basically) so yes you woudl in a sense need to learn each, but they're all very similar
[06:48] <neo2ubuntu> can anyone read this text?
[06:48] <Ademan> amir: desktop environment
[06:48] <amir> oh ok
[06:49] <neo2ubuntu> Is this the channel for help?
[06:49] <amir> ademan, which one is the easiest to learn for newbies to linux? or does it not really matter?
[06:49] <Ademan> amir: a lot of people like KDE because its very windows-like
[06:49] <cudaman73> Kubuntu is probably the most windows like
[06:49] <amir> hmmmm
[06:49] <Ademan> and Kubuntu uses KDE
[06:49] <moshe> hello
[06:49] <Ademan> so yeah, kubuntu is my bet
[06:49] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: Can you help me next?
[06:50] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: sure, i just got home whats the problem?
[06:50] <amir> Ademan, so if I really need to start a grasp on linux, do you recommend starting with kubuntu?
[06:50] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: My prob is i have a bad cd of Ubutu..im in it now
[06:50] <moshe> I'm running Edgy, and after enabling the nvidia proprietary driver, the fonts in Firefox went weird, like the menu bar and dialog fonts being much larger than before.  Anyone know how to fix this?
[06:50] <neo2ubuntu> Is there a way to install over the network 2 my pc
[06:51] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: no way to burn a new cd?
[06:51] <neo2ubuntu> I want to install Ubuntu on this hda but the program fails to complete
[06:51] <alpha255> neo2ubuntu, did you use a torrent file to download?
[06:51] <Ademan> moshe: i dunno about firefox, but gdm (the login screen) for me after i install the NVIDIA drivers has bigger fonts
[06:51] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: No working CD burnner here
[06:51] <Ademan> i honestly have never cared enough to mess with it though
[06:51] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: oh, thats a problem, how'd you get your first cd though?
[06:52] <amir> Ademan, are there just as many resources available for ubuntu as there are for kubuntu?
[06:52] <neo2ubuntu> I burned it in windows a while back but my winbloz is junk now
[06:52] <moshe> Ademan, it's strange that you said that, because all my other fonts were reset to smaller sizes.
[06:52] <amir> I mean in terms of help
[06:52] <neo2ubuntu> Im in the Ubuntu live CD part now
[06:52] <alpha255> neo2ubuntu, how about a friend's machine?
[06:53] <neo2ubuntu> not htis late
[06:53] <neo2ubuntu> its 1am here
[06:53] <Ediehow> how do i see font paths in ubuntu?
[06:53] <neo2ubuntu> i have been working on this 4 awhile
[06:53] <neo2ubuntu> is there a work around?
[06:54] <Ademan> amir: there's a #kubuntu channel, which honestly i think can be a lot more helpful than #ubuntu at times
[06:54] <ZirJoker> hi everybody
[06:54] <neo2ubuntu> like streaming the install from a Ubuntu server to install on my hda
[06:54] <neo2ubuntu> or can i get a new installer program to do it from the web?
[06:54] <ZirJoker> do you ppl know any autocad similar program?? i downloaded qcad but it doesnt open my dwg files x-x
[06:54] <amir> alright thank you Ademan
[06:54] <Ademan> amir: no problem :-) hope that helps
[06:55] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan:  I hear that it can be done
[06:55] <Ademan> personally i prefer ubuntu (which uses GNOME rather than KDE) but for total newbies i think KDE is a bette choice just because it will be slightly more familiar
[06:55] <neo2ubuntu> like through Knoppix
[06:55] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: i think they were just saying you could use the liveCD to download a new ISO to your hard drive and then burn it to a new liveCD
[06:55] <Ademan> but then again i don't know for sure, i've never heard of that
[06:55] <ZirJoker> im a newbie and i prefer gnome XD
[06:56] <neo2ubuntu> ok Ademan
[06:56] <Ademan> ZirJoker: i started out with GNOME myself, worked out fine, but i think it probably took me a bit longer
[06:56] <neo2ubuntu> So i can not have it install from another site
[06:56] <ZirJoker> :o
[06:56] <ZirJoker> Ademan do you know any program similar to autocad? XD
[06:56] <legon> gnome is kind of slow I think... is it my graphic card drivers, or is it just slow forever?
[06:56] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: do you have a running linux box at hand?
[06:56] <neo2ubuntu> i can make one
[06:57] <duncanm> anyone using compiz on edgy?
[06:57] <neo2ubuntu> I have distros of slackware 10.1, Zenwalk, gentoo, and some others...plus BackTracks, STD knoppix & other live cds
[06:57] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: you could build your harddisk into the other linux machine and debootstrap there
[06:58] <watson540> i see all these people saying they get fast xgl'ish stuff with just p3's man, am i missing something here? should i be running aiglx for my ati card instead of xgl?
[06:58] <neo2ubuntu> ChaosFan: Can I install BackTracks to my hda...then get Ubuntu over the net by this debootstrap
[06:58] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: you should install it somewhere else
[06:58] <Ademan> ZirJoker: i'd only tried autocad
[06:58] <neo2ubuntu> Im in Ubuntu now..but on the cd live part
[06:59] <Ademan> sorry, qcad
[06:59] <ZirJoker> autocad 2000 with wine?
[06:59] <Ademan> that might work, i dunno hold on
[06:59] <ZirJoker> my brother is an architect and he needs autocad 2006...
[06:59] <neo2ubuntu> can i just build some partitions ...mk some dir.. and then debootstrap it from this enviroment
[06:59] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: or use knoppix or something, then partition, format and mount your hda, debootstrap there and install a kernel and grub/lilo
[06:59] <ZirJoker> qcad doesnt supports dwg files x-x
[06:59] <iCod> I get ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1355:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card when I try to call in skype
[07:00] <neo2ubuntu> ChaosFan: Can I do it from this evo
[07:00] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: there are severeal tutorials out there, look for creation of a chroot
[07:00] <neo2ubuntu> ok
[07:00] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: if the livecd has the debootstrap-command
[07:01] <Ademan> ZirJoker: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=86 here's reports of how well (or not) autocad's different versions have worked on wine
[07:01] <neo2ubuntu> ChaosFan: I have the burned cd
[07:01] <Ademan> ZirJoker: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=6035   EEEWWW, last version of wine 0.9.23 was crap, we're on 0.9.24
[07:01] <Ademan> may be out of luck on wine...
[07:01] <ChaosFan> neo2ubuntu: just try to follow some chroot-tutorial, and do not forget to install a kernel and a boot loader afterwards
[07:02] <starignus> i have a problem tu burn cd-R i use gonome baker but  when i want to import a new sesion it dismount the cd-r, does it close the cd,-r? that is why the cd is unmounted
[07:02] <ChaosFan> and now i'm off, got to write a test in some minutes...
[07:02] <neo2ubuntu> ok im loking in to it
[07:02] <ZirJoker> hee hee
[07:02] <Alphax> I went and got myself an alternate install iso using jigdo; is there a jigdo template available for the desktop livecd?
[07:02] <ZirJoker> i havent used wine yet
[07:02] <ZirJoker> i installed linux 2 weeks ago
[07:02] <DigitalNinja> How do I flash a BIOS when I'm running Ubuntu Linux and the motherboard people want me to download a .exe file?
[07:02] <abattoir> hi, does ubuntu come with an IRC client installed on a default installation?
[07:03] <morgue> guys I'm following this howto (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=111225&highlight=logitech+quickcam) and it says I have to get the "kernel-headers 2.6.10 for i386 from synaptic" but those are not there... what should i do???
[07:03] <DigitalNinja> abattori: No
[07:03] <Ademan> wine is great, i'm currently playing day of defeat SOURCE at full speeds on my computer, quite impressive if you ask me, but its by no means perfect...yet...
[07:03] <neo2ubuntu> is there a small version of Ubuntu i could download to a jumpdrive to install to my hda
[07:04] <starignus> <Ademan> i have a problem tu burn cd-R i use gonome baker but  when i want to import a new sesion it dismount the cd-r, does it close the cd,-r? that is why the cd is unmounted
[07:04] <morgue> anyone knows how to install the logitech messenger webcam?
[07:05] <abattoir> DigitalNinja: ok, thanks
[07:05] <Ademan> a new session? like loging out and loging back in? or a gnome baker session? (sorry i'm unfamiliar with gnomebaker, sometime way back when someone told me to use graveman, and it works great for me)
[07:05] <neo2ubuntu> What will happen if i download Ubuntu agian to this session of Ubuntu live to the desktop?...Will it be able to fit?...and if so i think i can try to use my cd burnner if it will work this time>
[07:05] <Lynoure> neo2ubuntu: no, but there are other versions of linux for that, e.g. Knoppix
[07:05] <kronoman> neo2ubuntu: try fluxbuntu, or xubuntu, or damn small linux
[07:05] <neo2ubuntu> Lynoure: I have different distros of Knoppix
[07:05] <Lynoure> neo2ubuntu: good for you.
[07:06] <DigitalNinja> abattoir: you can install xchat
[07:06] <kronoman> neo2ubuntu: I think that damn small linux can be booted from USB or a file in a vfat filesystem, check it at his webage
[07:06] <fgxn> Does ubuntu have a tool like Debian's apt-file?
[07:06] <neo2ubuntu> kronoman: Are any of them able to get me up to date on Ubuntu from that linux distro?
[07:07] <kronoman> I don't know
[07:07] <neo2ubuntu> like damn small linux on my jumpdrive
[07:07] <neo2ubuntu> ok
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor`off
[07:07] <Lynoure> fgxn: yes, it exists, not installed by default
[07:07] <starignus> <Ademan> i  meat  whe i burn a cd but a cd-r with few information without closing the sesion and i want to use my cd-r qith the space that is empty
[07:07] <neo2ubuntu> well i just want to take the time to say that i think Ubuntu is great
[07:08] <fgxn> Lynoure: apt-get install apt-file tells me there's no such package
[07:08] <neo2ubuntu> I tried to get gentoo but i couldn't get to xwindos with startx
[07:08] <wastrel> ubunto
[07:08] <Ademan> starignus: i think it finalizes the disk whenever you burn (it writes zeroes to the rest of the cd)
[07:08] <alpha255> nite all
[07:08] <alpha255> :)
[07:08] <cisbrane> hey i just installed edgy (and ubuntu for first time) on my laptop. my sound kinda works. the built in speakers work fine no problem there. however when i plug in external speakers, the sound is not routed to the speakers... any ideas? i think the alsa driver is hd nvidia or something like that.. in winxp it's listed as connextant hd audio
[07:08] <iCod> ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1355:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card
[07:08] <iCod> Anyone?
[07:08] <alpha255> nice chattin
[07:08] <Lynoure> fgxn: Do you have universe and multiverse enabled? It's in one of those, I think
[07:08] <iCod> nite
[07:08] <Lynoure> !apt-file
[07:08] <ubotu> apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[07:08] <neo2ubuntu> my attempes to install Ubuntu on my local HD have failed so far...It keeps locking up on step 6...copying files at 49%
[07:09] <Lynoure> fgxn: in Universe, it seems
[07:09] <Alphax> !jigdo
[07:09] <fgxn> Lynoure: Ah, I don't have universe or multiverse, no. I was under the impression that those were evil packages not to be used. :)
[07:09] <ubotu> jigdo: GTK+ download manager (beta version). In component universe, is extra. Version 0.7.3-1 (edgy), package size 187 kB, installed size 440 kB
[07:09] <neo2ubuntu> I think its my disk of Ubuntu that is the problem
[07:09] <joeshmo> ello all!
[07:09] <Lynoure> fgxn: not completely supported, but in my opinion far from evil
[07:10] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: well if i remmeber right the old text mode installers seemed to hang around 48% but they didnt, how long did you give it at 49%?
[07:10] <neo2ubuntu> but im still able to get on Ubuntu from just the CD
[07:10] <amir> how can I find out if ubuntu has recognized my CD burner?
=== cudaman73 is now known as cuda|sl33p
[07:10] <fgxn> Lynoure: They don't get security upgrades, neg?
[07:10] <Lynoure> fgxn: the lines for them even exists in the sources list, just commented out, if I remember
[07:10] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: I took a nap and woke back up hours l8r to it still at 49%
[07:11] <neo2ubuntu> The CD just stopped spinning
[07:11] <fgxn> "universe WILL NOT receive any review or updates from the Ubuntu security team" quoth sources.list
[07:11] <Lynoure> fgxn: then you just need to watch the security announcements a bit youself
[07:11] <joeshmo> uh oh
[07:11] <joeshmo> new security updates?
[07:11] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: try doing a md5sum of the cd and comparing it with what they have on ubuntu.com
[07:11] <neo2ubuntu> I was hoping there was a text base installer that might work around the GUI installer
[07:12] <starignus>  <Ademan>so it do it for default in linux ubuntu
[07:12] <neo2ubuntu> Ademan: If my cd is bad...Can I get the good files i need from the web?
[07:12] <fgxn> Lynoure: I wouldn't even know where to start looking for security announcements that weren't issued by the Ubuntu team.
[07:12] <Alphax> neo2ubuntu, the alternate installer does that
[07:12] <neo2ubuntu> I just need the core kernal on my HD...then i can update
[07:12] <Lynoure> fgxn: But I can see if you do not want to do that. I assume you are also not installing any binary-only things or any proprietery codex, then?
[07:12] <Ademan> neo2ubuntu: short of downloading the ISO from ubuntu.com again (use bittorrent) and then burning it to a new liveCD no there's no way i know of
[07:13] <iCod> does anyone have problems with modprobe?
[07:13] <fgxn> Lynoure: Nope...I try to stay pretty vanilla.
[07:13] <fgxn> Ah, good. nvi is in universe as well.
[07:13] <neo2ubuntu> was that the chroot
[07:13] <Ruggero> I installed Edgy Eft from Dapper and my SD Card is not recognized as a disk  anymore from ubuntu, it doesn't even show in /proc/partitions, any clue how to reactivate it? the SD slot is embedded in my HP laptop. Have
[07:13] <amir> Ademan, is there a quick way to switch to kubuntu from within ubuntu?
[07:13] <Alphax> grrr. why is there no .jigdo for teh desktop cd?
[07:14] <Ayabara_> I upgraded from dapper to edgy using apt, and my computer freezes during startup. can anyone help me debug/fix this?
[07:15] <Lynoure> fgxn: for a tool of Debian origin, I'd just look at debian security announcements, but it's not a complicated tool, I'd say your risk of getting a remote exploit that uses apt-file is very slim
[07:15] <neo2ubuntu> so what was the other method of installing to my hd with out using the version on the Ubuntu GUI...can I *get it from the web to install?
[07:15] <VigoFuse> How many gigs sould I allocate for an ubuntu install to HDD? And is the DSKPRT or whatever inside the Desktop CD?
[07:15] <neo2ubuntu> Can I get Debian and change that into Ubuntu?
[07:16] <fgxn> Lynoure: My fear was more based on ignorance of when apt might choose a particular package out of universe instead of main, so I'd end up installing the unsupported, universe-version of some critical app.
[07:16] <fgxn> Lynoure: Like, say, apache2
[07:17] <Rizla420> hey guys(gals) can someone please help me with a really simple request
[07:17] <neo2ubuntu> well ty all for your help
[07:17] <Lynoure> fgxn: you can just enable then now, do apt-get update, apt-get install the packages you need, put the sources.list back how it was and do apt-get update again
[07:17] <neo2ubuntu> im not sure what really to do
[07:17] <Rizla420> im still trying to get my hands around the way linux operates and installs programs.  A little while back i installed bluefish to do some of my php scripting
[07:17] <neo2ubuntu> but im sure ill make it happen
[07:17] <Rizla420> but i dont know where its installed
[07:17] <picasso> no way.. in ubuntu 6.10, I can no longer move a window to a different workspace by dragging it while pressing my key combination to switch workspace
[07:17] <fgxn> Lynoure: That won't cause tools like aptitude to see it as a dead package and remove it?
[07:18] <Landon> Hey all, I'm having problems playing .avi files and this is after I installed my win32codecs, and on top of that, my flash player is all of a sudden messing up. When I try to go to sites like YouTube or Google video, it'll just play one second of the clip without sound, upload the rest, and just not do anything, should I uninstall firefox and re-install it? I don't know what else to do.
[07:18] <Rizla420> i see it in my add/remove application list
[07:18] <Ademan> amir: yes, once you install ubuntu or kubuntu you can install the ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop and at the login screen you can choose to start in either KDE or GNOME
[07:18] <neo2ubuntu> is there a different installer i could get from the add/remove part?
[07:18] <Rizla420> where is the executable located or a shortcut ?
[07:18] <JohnAbbe> I also have hopeful a simple question
[07:18] <JohnAbbe> Installing Edgy on an old iMac and get a black screen partway through booting up. This http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1702331 thread recommended editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf which i did, now how do i restart gdm?
[07:19] <fgxn> Rizla420: Probably something along the lines of /usr/bin/bluefish
[07:19] <grndslm> how does xubuntu run with 32mb of ram??
[07:19] <grndslm> anybody know?
[07:19] <neo2ubuntu> ok im off to try to do this
[07:19] <Lynoure> fgxn: I'm a kubuntu user myself, and use adept and apt-get, so I am not 100% sure, but if it did, there was no possibility of using aptitude with stable+unstable mix of Debian and I'd be shocked to hear that to be the case
[07:19] <morgue> My webcam was working, then I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 and is not working now, what should I do?
[07:19] <Ademan> grndslm: xfce (what xubuntu uses) is much smaller and lighter than GNOME
[07:19] <Alphax> JohnAbbe, change consoles and kill gdm then restart gdm?
[07:19] <JohnAbbe> I tried that
[07:19] <Rizla420> nah no luck, doesnt exist
[07:20] <JohnAbbe> processes died
[07:20] <kronoman> in ubuntu, do i need to fine tune my hard disk? or dma tranfers are enabled by default ?? (talking about hdparm)
[07:20] <JohnAbbe> but "gdm" still does nothing
[07:20] <grndslm> Ademan, i realize...but 32 is damn small....maybe even too small for xfce
[07:20] <Lynoure> fgxn: no harm in trying
[07:20] <morgue> can someone give me a hand?
[07:20] <fgxn> Lynoure: All right. I'll give it a poke. Thanks for the pointers.
[07:20] <grndslm> does anybody here actually use 32 mb or less of ram??
[07:20] <kronoman> grndslm: if you fine tune linux, you can run it with less memory, i.e slackware with X and fluxbox can run in 8 mb
[07:21] <morgue> cynical, u there?
[07:21] <JohnAbbe> My Commodore PET had 32K of RAM...
[07:21] <Lynoure> fgxn: you have just gone from Debian to Ubuntu? (curious)
[07:21] <neo2ubuntu> pk..i just installed K3b...
[07:21] <VigoFuse> My Tandy TSR82 has less
[07:21] <Ademan> grndslm: i agree, if you've got limited resources use fluxbox
[07:21] <fgxn> Lynoure: I have.
[07:21] <morgue> Can someone help me? my webcam was working, then I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 and is not working now, what should I do?
[07:21] <ubuntu_newb> I just installed a control panel for my Ubuntu LAMP installation.  Is Ubuntu Debian 3.1 (Sarge) or Debian 4.0 (Etch)?
[07:21] <neo2ubuntu> can i just download a new ISO of Ubuntu and burn it in this Ubuntu live cd part and retry
[07:21] <JohnAbbe> morgue, it would probably help if you gave more details.
[07:21] <grndslm> hah...my mom brought home this spare computer from her work...and i just dunno if she could use anything that didn't end with a *buntu
[07:22] <wastrel> fgxn:  nvi eh
[07:22] <robert_> anyone here ever used a sit device(ipv6-to-4) before, and had it work?
[07:22] <fgxn> wastrel: Indeed.
[07:22] <grndslm> i barely can use linux, so she'd barely be able to use "linux for human beings"
[07:22] <Lynoure> fgxn: I did that on my laptop 6 months ago and still sometimes think about going back as it's more work to keep a lean system in Ubuntu and I do not so care for all the gui stuff
[07:22] <neo2ubuntu> can i use a cdrw
[07:22] <JohnAbbe> anyone have any more ideas about how to restart gdm when i'm booting from CD live?
[07:22] <fgxn> Lynoure: I've been using debian stable since 1999...I'm having trouble finding my way around some of the pointy bits of changing. :)
[07:22] <wastrel> fgxn:  it took me a while but i got to like vim - despite the undo weirdness :] 
[07:22] <ubuntu_newb>  Is Ubuntu Debian 3.1 (Sarge) or Debian 4.0 (Etch)?
[07:22] <morgue> JohnAbbe, I'm using EasyCam2 and it detects the camera but when I go through the setup it says there was an error
[07:23] <tritium> Lynoure: more work?  No...
[07:23] <fgxn> wastrel: Their change to undo is the deal-breaker for me as well. :)
[07:23] <morgue> I have a logitech quickcam, it was working fine before I upgraded to 6.10
[07:23] <Lynoure> fgxn: But Ubuntu is an experience worth having, for sure.
[07:23] <wastrel> ubuntu_newb:  ubuntu releases are modified from sid i believe
[07:23] <Landon> Anyone know how I can play .avi files even after I've installed the Win32Codecs?
[07:23] <ubuntu_newb> what is sid?
[07:24] <fgxn> Rizla420: According to dpkg, it is called /usr/bin/bluefish.
[07:24] <Lynoure> tritium: yes it is. Removing stuff makes one have to install stuff back in just to get upgrade to next version go right
[07:24] <iratsu> are tehre some bluetooth problems in edgy?
[07:24] <Railer> Synaptic vs apt-get any difference? or just one CLI vs GUI?
[07:24] <fgxn> heh
[07:24] <starignus> <Ademan>thanks i coul do it with keb and not with gonome baker
[07:24] <starignus> <Ademan> thaks
[07:24] <Alphax> Landon, .avi is a bit hit and miss because .avi is just a container; if you don't have the right codec, it won't play
[07:24] <tritium> Lynoure: you're referring to the -desktop metapackages?
[07:24] <grndslm> ok...i wanna start a fun game before i go to bed....what's the least amount of ram that you use on a desktop
[07:24] <Lynoure> tritium: and lots of bloat gets installed by default, like software for a scanner
[07:24] <Lynoure> tritium: yes.

[07:25] <fgxn> Lynoure: I don't really have a reason to change, I've always been extremely happy with debian...but I thought I'd take a look at how the other half lives. :)
[07:26] <Alphax> grndslm, oh that was windows 98. No I've got 1GB on my SUSE 10.0 desktop
[07:26] <Lynoure> fgxn: my reason exactly :) Come hang at #ubuntu-offtopic sometime, btw, it's a fun place
[07:26] <Railer> JohnAbbe Which Pet did you have? DId you have the internal or external tape drive?
[07:26] <yogeshitbhu> hello everyone !!! :) i am a newbei to linux .....can i start wth the debian
[07:26] <ubuntu_newb> this is the control panel I'm using...  http://www.syscp.org/wiki/Downloads
[07:26] <Alphax> er, 48MB
[07:26] <ubuntu_newb> will that work with Ubuntu?
=== Cas_ is now known as Cas
[07:26] <tritium> yogeshitbhu: you _could_, but this is an ubuntu channel.  Why not start with ubuntu?
[07:26] <JDStone> !multiverse
[07:26] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[07:26] <grndslm> Alphax, yea...Win98 runs surprisingly well on my mom's old work computer w/ 32mb of ram...i'm convinced she just needs to donate it to good will or something

[07:27] <globe> To put ubuntu on a Macbook should I use the 32 or 64-bit version?
[07:27] <Alphax> :)
[07:27] <morgue> JohnAbbe, are you there?
[07:27] <fgxn> globe: Do you want a 32 bit OS a 64 bit one?
[07:27] <Railer> <ubuntu_newb> everone is telling me to go with ispconfig
[07:27] <JDStone> why isn't MythTV 0.20 in Universe repos instead of Multiverse?
[07:27] <Ademan> hey the k3d package failed to install (not k3b, this is a 3d modeling program) and it failed on the post-install script, now whenever i try to do anything with apt it first tries to run that stupid post-install script and it keeps failing and blocking me from doing anything else, including removing the offending package, what can i do?
[07:28] <fgxn> globe: I can't imagine there's any other reason for choosing one over the other
[07:28] <globe> fgxn: I guess I was wondering if the macbooks are 64bit
[07:28] <grndslm> JDStone, because it's unsupported
[07:28] <VigoFuse> Problem is this HP WinXP box did NOT come with a Win Install disk, so how to partion so I can install?
[07:28] <JDStone> Multiverse means that the packages could be broken and security holes, right?
[07:28] <JDStone> and no updates?
[07:28] <grndslm> it's too large for the ubuntu team to review, i'm sure
[07:28] <JDStone> grndslm: are those true? ^
[07:28] <Alphax> VigoFuse, get a livecd with gparted/qtparted
[07:29] <gustavol1> can I run sun-jre on amd64 ?
[07:29] <grndslm> mythtv is friggin' huge, ubuntu guys have different goals in mind
[07:29] <fgxn> globe: Oh. Well, that depends. Do you have the Core Duo version or the Core 2 Duo version?
[07:29] <JDStone> grndslm: no, I mean this: Multiverse means that the packages could be broken and security holes, right?
[07:29] <JDStone> 	JDStone	and no updates?
[07:29] <fgxn> globe: The former is 32, the latter 64
[07:29] <grndslm> JDStone, mythtv 0.20 in edgy multiverse works great
[07:29] <bluefox83> anyone here use qbittorrent?

[07:30] <morgue> Can someone help me? my webcam was working, then I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 and is not working now, what should I do? I tried easycam2 but it says there's an error, when I try to open camorama "could not connect to video device (/dev/video0) please check connection.. any suggestions please?
[07:30] <JDStone> grndslm: well, I'll try them again, but when I upgraded to 0.20 from 0.19, it screwed everytihng up
[07:30] <JDStone> thanks grndslm
[07:30] <grndslm> JDStone, i doubt that the packages will be broken if you use STRICTLY the ubuntu repos, but if you add in merillat's and seveas, and all the other repos, something might break due to incompatible packages...
[07:30] <JDStone> oh, i see.  thanks grndslm.  maybe tha'ts the problem

[07:32] <clearzen> firebird619:  I have beryl installed but when I try to enable it I get a black screen then it kicks me back out to the login screen. Do you have any idea what my problem could be?
[07:32] <tritium> morgue: dmesg is a command you use from the command line
[07:33] <Deramin> I'm running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. having some issues with my Anjuta IDE crashing, but I can solve the problem if I knew how to fully uninstall a program. Including any preferences files. I apparently created a total program fubar by moving the toolbars, and it persisted through a uninstall and reinstall using the basic add-remove programs interface. If someone knows another way to fix that crash, I'm all ears, too.
[07:33] <morgue> tritium, ok when i run that i get a lot of stuff, what should i be looking for?
[07:34] <firebird619> clearzen: No, sorry. maybe try #ubuntu-xgl channel. I just followed the Howto on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy and it worked great.
[07:34] <grndslm> Deramin, you actually find anjuta usable...i've tried in on more than one occasion and have never found it to be reliable
[07:34] <tritium> morgue: messages about your camera.  You can pipe the output into less so you can page through it: dmesg | less
[07:34] <globe> welp...gnite!
[07:34] <JohnAbbe> (I was discinnected so didn't see any answers. Will ask once more then stop bugging y'all) - any other ideas about how to restart gdm when i'm booting from CD live?
[07:34] <blazemonger> is there a prog for linux that automaticly adjustst the geometry settings on my monitor
[07:35] <fgxn> JohnAbbe: /etc/init.d/gdm restart doesn't work?
[07:36] <grndslm> Deramin, have you ever tried programming just with gedit and gcc/g++??  what language(s) are you using?
[07:36] <Deramin> grndslm: Javascript class, c++ class, and half a term of Java using it. I tried programing using other things before learning how to convert it to Java, but I couldn't find anything I liked half as well.
[07:37] <fgxn> Deramin: apt-get --purge remove <whatever>
[07:37] <troopa> Is there any security reasons why I would not want to be using the LTS (6.06, Drapper) version of Ubuntu? Or is this not even an issue?
[07:37] <JohnAbbe> fgxn - no
[07:37] <grndslm> i can't stand anything that uses java...avoid it like the plague, personally
[07:37] <Lathiat> troopa: No, dapper is fully supported
[07:37] <morgue> tritium, I can't find anything that says webcam

[07:38] <morgue> tritium, Only logitech I see is the usb receiver
[07:38] <troopa> So, the security updates for Drapper are still very frequent and everything is kept up-to-date?
[07:38] <morgue> tritium, let me see
[07:38] <Landon> What do I need to play DVD's in ubuntu?
[07:38] <wastrel> Deramin:  try what fgxn said with --purge, and also move ~/.anjuta  somewhere & see if that fixes

[07:38] <grndslm> Deramin, you should try just using gedit, tho...it's pretty friggin' sweet and totally reliable
[07:38] <tritium> troopa: yes, it's got Long-Term Support (LTS) for 5 years

[07:39] <cafuego> tritium: 3 years innit?
[07:39] <Ademan> grndslm: jus don't use java... lol
[07:39] <grndslm> Ademan, that's what i said
[07:39] <Ademan> grndslm: but if you're going to, use either netbeans or eclipse

[07:42] <Deramin> grndslm: but does it draw a line at the end of every tab? It seems silly, but it's the difference between always knowing where I am and getting lost. I also like code completion, and code folding.

[07:42] <Geoffrey2> crimsun, thanks :)

[07:43] <Geoffrey2> oh, before I go through make and make install, is the latest mplayer available for Ubuntu?  or do I need to compile from source?

[07:44] <fgxn> Ademan: You can go into /var/lib/dpkg/info/<thatpackage>.postinst and see what happened, fix the script, and then run dpkg --configure -a to let it finish that package and fix apt
[07:44] <grndslm> Deramin, hah...good one
[07:44] <grndslm> but i'd still rather have a stable app that did everything i wanted it to do, than an app that has never been stable
[07:44] <tritium> morgue: okay, that's a good sign
[07:44] <Geoffrey2> pre8?  ok, that means the latest version's not in the repos yet, guess I build from source
[07:44] <theDtTvB> Are there anyway to turn direct rendering on?
[07:45] <grndslm> Deramin, anyway...i'd look into netbeans if i were you....i've heard lotsa good things

[07:50] <JohnAbbe> it has it, it's just that running it doesn't do anything
[07:50] <fgxn> JohnAbbe: Is gdm crashing?
[07:50] <JohnAbbe> no
[07:50] <fgxn> Maybe it's restarting it, but it crashes too early?
[07:51] <JohnAbbe> but the screen comes up black
[07:51] <tritium> JohnAbbe: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart does nothing?
[07:51] <JohnAbbe> no, i just get another command line prompt
[07:51] <tritium> you used sudo?
[07:51] <JohnAbbe> i'll try sudo invoke-rc.d gdm

[08:00] <amir> I loaded kubuntu but it looks like ubuntu with just kubuntu + ubuntu programs on in
[08:00] <amir> on it*
[08:00] <Deramin> wastrel: the one that locates things for me. XD
[08:01] <morgue> fgxn, no, easycam2 installed everything so i really don't know
[08:01] <fgxn> Deramin: No, that's a command. "which locate"
[08:01] <royce> is ubuntu built around making the windows directory hard to find. i cant find it, im too much of a newbie. do i need to do some kind of hdd mounting stuff...?
[08:01] <fgxn> Deramin: It may not be installed, in which case you have to apt-get install slocate
[08:02] <fgxn> Deramin: Then you have to run updatedb and wait for the locate database to be built.
[08:02] <morgue> fgxn, maybe this can help? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=111225&highlight=logitech+quickcam
[08:02] <wastrel> or just run  find ~ -iname anjuta
[08:02] <shaslap> where can i set what processes run on start up, tremulous server keeps starting by default and then continually using 80% cpu time and killing my battery life
[08:02] <Deramin> fgxn: funny how that turned into a "Who's on First" type of comedy routine. Sometimes things in Linux are too well named
[08:02] <royce> Is there a simple command i can throw into Terminal that will locate my windows xp directory
[08:02] <fgxn> Deramin: It's probably just as easy to either: 1) find /home/<user> -name \*whatever\*; or 2) strace -e open -o /tmp/somefile <whatever> and see where it's finding things.
[08:03] <fgxn> morgue: sudo modprobe quickcam
[08:03] <morgue> done
[08:04] <fgxn> morgue: cat /dev/video0
[08:04] <wastrel> shaslap:  you can modify startup programs with  update-rc.d   sudo update-rc.d -f tremulous remove  will remove it from startup
[08:04] <morgue> cat: /dev/video0: No such device
[08:04] <shaslap> thanks wastrel
[08:04] <fgxn> morgue: USB device?
[08:04] <morgue> fgxn, yes
[08:04] <fgxn> morgue: tail -f /var/log/syslog
[08:05] <fgxn> morgue: hit enter a few times to distinguish the current "End"
[08:05] <fgxn> morgue: Then unplug and re-plug the USB device and watch what the logs say
[08:05] <Deramin> Yay! Anjuta is fixed! I may need to redo my syntax highlighting, but at least I can do my homework XD. thank you.
[08:06] <fgxn> Deramin: What was it?
[08:06] <firebird619> Could someone help me out with a gdm and/or driver problem. Since installing Edgy, Ubuntu doesn't always start, when it doesn't, it gets just past grub and sticks at a blank screen. I worked with iter earlier today and we disabled gdm, so I can get to Ubuntu by logging in at a text-login and then starting x.
[08:06] <yogeshitbhu> can u tell me the substitute for your-freedom(windows) in ubuntu (it is used forspeeding up the net)

[08:07] <Madpilot> jordan, it's just a netsplit - nothing the ops can do
[08:07] <yogeshitbhu> can nyone tell me thesubstitue for your freedom in ubuntu
[08:07] <wastrel> mmm that was fun
[08:08] <jordan> Madpilot: Sorry, I thought someone was spamming, I don't know much about IRC :)
[08:08] <morgue> fgxn, did you catch my msg?
[08:08] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, what?
[08:08] <Belutz> hi all
[08:08] <turk> hi
[08:09] <fgxn> morgue: I did, but I'm not sure where to go from there. I've never owned a webcam of any sort, I was just applying general concepts.
[08:09] <Deramin> fgxn: one of the files under ~.gnome2 seems to have done it. ((sorry for the repeat if you actually saw it))
[08:09] <Belutz> someone ask me why 6.10 doesn't have LTS, what should I answer that?
[08:09] <morgue> :(
[08:09] <Madpilot> Belutz, not every release is an LTS release
[08:10] <amir> could someone help me get .wmv files to play in firefox?
[08:10] <fgxn> It would be insane of Ubuntu to try and do that.
[08:10] <Belutz> Madpilot, and why is that? i've been looking in the wiki and can't find the answer
[08:10] <morgue> fgxn, any suggestions? :(
[08:10] <amir> I cant get any windows media player files to work in ubuntu
[08:10] <yogeshitbhu> sustitue for your freedom
[08:10] <wastrel> ubuntu doesn't have unlimited resources, so can't provide the type of service needed for lts for every release
[08:11] <fgxn> morgue: No, I'm pretty much tapped at this point, sorry. It would appear that the "quickcam" module doesn't register the same major and minor device as what your system is expecting to find it at, but I don't know enough about webcams to tell you where to look for more.
[08:11] <Madpilot> Belutz, LTS is for corporate enviroments & such, were they don't *want* to update everything every 6 months, and where 18months of support isn't long enough
[08:11] <morgue> tritium, u there?
[08:11] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot: it is used for increased net accesss in windows and i am not getting its ubuntu version
[08:11] <coldboot> What do you do if "aptitude -f install" can't find a solution to broken packages in several allotted times?
[08:12] <turk> hello everyone
[08:12] <amir> Could someone show me how to get windows codecs to play in ubuntu please?
[08:12] <wastrel> fgxn, morgue you can add usb device id's into /etc/udev/rules.d/  files to enable the udev system to recognize more devices
[08:12] <jordan> !codecs
[08:12] <morgue> fgxn, np man, thanks
[08:12] <morgue> wastrel, how do I do that?
[08:12] <amir> Jordan, how do I get those codecs into firefox to play them?
[08:13] <jordan> amir, Try mplayer-mozplugin.
[08:13] <BobLoblaw> BobLoblaw: hi
[08:13] <Belutz> Madpilot, one more questions, are the LTS versions would be release in every 2 years or how many months?
[08:13] <coz_> amir, hold on ...I will get the link for you
[08:13] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, what do you mean by 'increased web access'?
[08:13] <amir> Jordan, how do I do that?
[08:13] <amir> thank you very much coz_
[08:13] <BobLoblaw> !erc
[08:13] <fgxn> wastrel: I'll have to dig into that. I spent so much time learning devfs, I didn't want to get burned again on udev, so I've been holding off.
[08:13] <BobLoblaw> !gentoo
[08:13] <Madpilot> Belutz, it sounds like every 3rd release is going to be LTS - possibly - so every 18 months
[08:14] <wastrel> morgue:  easiest thing is prolly to grep in that directory for webcam or something to find the file with the webcam definitions.  then copy one of the existiing lines and change the device ID's to match yours (which you find from the syslog as you plug in the device)
[08:14] <JohnAbbe> still trying to restart gdm on live 6.10 (on a 500MHz G3 iMac)
[08:14] <wastrel> make sense?
[08:14] <JohnAbbe> tried 'sudo gdm restart' and got 'GDM already running. Aborting!'
[08:14] <Belutz> Madpilot, thanks a lot for your information :)
[08:14] <coz_> amir,  go here, read carefully, work slowly... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[08:14] <JohnAbbe> tried 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart' and got 'invoke-rc.d initscript gdm, action "restart" failed.'
[08:14] <wastrel> fgxn:  i had to learn it to get my clie to sync :] 
[08:14] <JohnAbbe> any more ideas? :)
[08:14] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:means in my college band widht is very low and its very hard to surfing so we use your freedom for better access
[08:15] <jordan> amir: sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
[08:15] <fgxn> JohnAbbe: "sudo killall gdm"
[08:15] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, so it's a compression utility or something like that?
[08:15] <JohnAbbe> ok...
[08:15] <fgxn> JohnAbbe: Then /etc/init.d/gdm start
[08:15] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot: yeah
[08:16] <morgue> wastrel, ok i'm on rules.d trying to find something that says webcam
[08:16] <pibarnas> How can I correct the problem of dark gtk-themes on firefox (the menubar isn't displayed)?
[08:16] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:i hv one more problem by default ubuntu has not detected my sound card so i am not able to play songs ... can i get the drivers from the net wch can helpo me out
[08:17] <royce> Does anyone know what area to goto on gnome-look.org to find Ubuntu themes???
[08:17] <jordan> amir: Once you have mplayer installed, you can make firefox use it instead of totem by running: sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*
[08:17] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, ah, OK. I've never used any of the compression utils, not sure if there are any Linux versions
[08:18] <Madpilot> royce, look for Metacity themes & GTK2 themes
[08:18] <Madpilot> !themes
[08:18] <wastrel> morgue:  anything with  quickcam or qcam ?
[08:18] <troopa> Why are people on the ubuntu forums complaining so much about the security in Ubuntu? I have seen some posts saying "There is no firewall by default", but Ubuntu uses IPTables. Do they just think firestarter is the actual firewall?
[08:18] <wastrel> what firewall rules are active by default?
[08:19] <Madpilot> troopa, yes, probably. There are also no open/active ports by default, so little need for a full firewall
[08:19] <troopa> I'm not sure, honestly.
[08:19] <morgue> wastrel, not a file, I'm looking inside the files
[08:19] <amir> jordan, I input sudo touch /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/*mplayer*, but nothing came up, it just went to the next line. It didnt tell me anything, or is it not supposed to?
[08:19] <jordan> amir: It isn't supposed to.
[08:19] <troopa> Mad: I set my hosts.deny to ALL:ALL when I install any distribution.
[08:19] <amir> oh ok thank you Jordan
[08:20] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot: do u knw ny such package????
[08:20] <jordan> amir: Did that work?
[08:20] <troopa> Plus, there are no open services -- and that is pretty proactive, imho.
[08:20] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, for the compression you need? No idea, sorry.
[08:20] <amir> I am going to check right now Jordan
[08:20] <amir> do I have to restart firefox?
[08:20] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:k fine and my second prob
[08:20] <troopa> So, does anyone know why people on the forums are complaining so much about the lack of security in Ubuntu?
[08:20] <jordan> amir: Probably
[08:21] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:can i get the drivers from the net wch can run audio in my machine
[08:21] <Madpilot> troopa, because they're used to having to install a whole raft of "security' apps in Windows, and don't realize they're all unneeded in *nix?
[08:21] <morgue> wastrel, there's nothing
[08:21] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, you should be able to get things working without extra drivers
[08:21] <wastrel> morgue:  sec i'm installing quickcam
[08:21] <morgue> kk
[08:22] <atarinox> can anybody recommend a relatively painless DC++ client to install for xfce?
[08:22] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:actually the song is running but i am not able to hear it as if it had been muted.....  the video is also running
[08:22] <morgue> wasabi, I used easycam2 for the setup
[08:22] <amir> no its not Jordan, it's just giving me a message that it is playing the video, but not actually playing the image
[08:22] <yogeshitbhu> so it mean tht the version wch i am using does not support my sound card??
[08:22] <weedar> I'm trying to compile a module for my webcam, which worked yesterday. But I have since upgraded my kernel 2.6.15-26 to 2.6.15-27 and during compile it cannot find /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-amd64-generic/build
[08:22] <aerturas> ar kas moka lietuviskai?
[08:22] <yogeshitbhu> Madpilot:so it mean tht the version wch i am using does not support my sound card??
[08:23] <morgue> wastrel, when I run easycam2 setup I get "choose your webcam from the list, and I get this Bus 001 Device 006: ID 046d:08f6 Logitech, Inc.
[08:23] <crimsun> weedar: because you don't have linux-headers-$(uname -r) installed
[08:23] <crimsun> weedar: remember that an ABI bump (26->27) means you need to grab the matching headers, too
[08:23] <troopa> Madpilot: True. I am a very paranoid person (and I love security-based things) so I always apply the GRSec patch to any Linux distribution I use. Maybe ubuntu could come default with the GRSec patch or something, since users want better security.
[08:23] <Madpilot> yogeshitbhu, right-click on the speaker icon beside the clock (top right corner), go thru both the Prefences & the Volume Control, make sure nothings turned off by mistake
[08:23] <weedar> crimsun: but I do have the directory over build there
[08:24] <crimsun> weedar: make sure you actually have linux-headers-$(uname -r) installed
[08:24] <jordan> amir: You may also want a package called win32codecs which is illegal if you don't own a copy of windows, I can help you install that also but first try an mpeg4 video to see if mplayer itself is working.
[08:24] <yogeshitbhu> madpoilot:    i hv chked all tht but is not working
[08:24] <wastrel> morgue:  i think you have a diff prob than just a udev rule
[08:25] <wastrel> morgue:  is the quickcam module loading?
[08:25] <morgue> wastrel, I don't know, how can I check?
[08:25] <fgxn> lsmod | grep -i quick
[08:25] <amir> well I do own a copy of windows, so if possible could you help me with that Jordan?
[08:25] <fgxn> wastrel: I think the problem is that the quickcam module doesn't register the device nodes that /dev/video0 lives on
[08:26] <fgxn> But that's a pretty wild shot. I don't know where the quickcam module comes from, so I can't be sure.
[08:26] <yogeshitbhu> madpoilot when i finishes the installation the sound was heared in it....  so wht can be sayed....
[08:26] <jordan> amir, Are you running Edgy or Dapper?
[08:26] <weedar> amir: what webcam are you setting up?
[08:26] <amir> weedar, I'm not setting up a webcam
[08:27] <amir> Jordan, well I am running edgy/kubuntu somehow
[08:27] <fgxn> wastrel: That is, quickcam doesn't appear to be part of the kernel source, so I don't know where he's getting it.
[08:27] <wastrel> webcam guy is morgue
[08:27] <weedar> crimsun, you are of course right. I was so sure I had it installed, but... :)
[08:27] <amir> Jordan, I am going to say running edgy
[08:27] <morgue> weedar, I'm the one setting up the webcam :P
[08:27] <weedar> ah, then...what webcam are YOU setting up morgue :)
[08:27] <morgue> logitech quickcam
[08:27] <wastrel> fgxn the forum post has them building from source
[08:28] <morgue> Logitech QuickCam Messenger
[08:28] <jordan> amir: Ok , you need to add some lines to your sources.list: sudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:28] <weedar> morgue, not the "quickam for notebooks pro"?
[08:28] <Illusion_of_Art> Is there a way to reset Ubuntu to its defaults
[08:28] <morgue> no, the Messenger one
[08:28] <fgxn> wastrel: OK, I closed that tab already. :)
[08:28] <morgue> weedar, this one http://www.fredx.de/shop/catalog/images/logitech-messenger.gif
[08:28] <WhyNot> hi does anyone can tell me what are the minimum requirements to run Ubuntu
[08:29] <amir> Jordan, I will be with you in a sec, I am trying something that I got from the ubuntu help site, it is downloading something
[08:29] <fgxn> WhyNot: A computer?
[08:29] <WhyNot> fgxn yep
[08:29] <coldboot> How do you fix an ubuntu system that suggests you remove hundreds of packages when you do aptitude -f install?
[08:29] <fgxn> WhyNot: Depending on what you want, Ubuntu could potentially run on a 386 with about 8GB of HDD and 32MB of RAM, maybe less
[08:29] <WhyNot> :|
[08:30] <WhyNot> oh I have a pentium II with 533MHz
[08:30] <bun-bun> coldboot# you might have broken packages
[08:30] <fgxn> WhyNot: It will almost certainly run on that.
[08:30] <coldboot> bun-bun: I do, but there are tons of them
[08:30] <jordan> WhyNot: You might want to try xubuntu.
[08:30] <bun-bun> coldboot# open up synaptic and sort by broken packages
[08:30] <WhyNot> I thouhgt I need to install lighter version os Ubuntu like ubuntu-lite or Xubuntu, are they good?
[08:30] <bun-bun> coldboot# and remove them all
[08:30] <WhyNot> I tried Ubuntu-lite but gave and fatal error on X
[08:31] <jordan> WhyNot: Ubuntu-lite is not officially supported, xubuntu is.
[08:31] <Ademan> how can i disable gtk accessibility?
[08:31] <coldboot> bun-bun: I get no broken packages in synaptic
[08:32] <morgue> wastrel, u there?
[08:32] <WhyNot> jordan so Xubuntu will haave the basic features and run faster right?
[08:32] <wastrel> hi yes morgue
[08:32] <gaminggeek> hello
[08:32] <jordan> WhyNot: Yes.
[08:32] <WhyNot> cool
[08:32] <WhyNot> downloading atm
[08:32] <coldboot> bun-bun: What exactly is a broken package, anyway?
[08:32] <bun-bun> coldboot# in synaptic click the Custom Filters button
[08:32] <amir> Alright Jordan, what were you saying?
[08:32] <morgue> wastrel, any suggestions?
[08:32] <timhaughton> What is the GNUPG key management utility called in Gnome (Edgy)
[08:32] <jordan> amir: Ok , you need to add some lines to your sources.list: sudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:32] <bun-bun> coldboot# and then click Broken in left column
[08:32] <gaminggeek> anyone else hate they way totem plays crap all correctly?
[08:32] <bun-bun> coldboot# that will show you the broken packages
[08:33] <coldboot> bun-bun: There are no broken packages shown when I click broken in the left menu
[08:33] <Illusion_of_Art> My Ubuntu will no longer support sound, does not work with multiple users, and refuses to recognize a hard drive I formatted in Ubuntu which worked previously. I want to set everything back to its default. Is there a way to do that?
[08:33] <coldboot> bun-bun: I unchecked broken in the filters, still nothing
[08:33] <bun-bun> coldboot# broken packages are usually when you try to install packages and dependant packages are missing
[08:33] <Majic> I was wondering if I could get some help with the "ndiswrapper" program.  I used it to install a Windows driver for my wireless card and I don't know how to use the card.  The driver is installed and it recognizes that the hardware and driver are correct.  I just don't know how to configure anything beyond that.
[08:33] <bun-bun> coldboot# hmm, it should list them..  apt shows them though?
[08:34] <amir> holy cow it just shit a brick Jordan, it just said stuff like no database available! and application "kate" crashing
[08:34] <morgue> weedar, any suggestions?
[08:34] <scamboy> was up everyone....
[08:34] <coldboot> `aptitude -f install` says there are broken packages, but `apt-get -f install` says everything is fine

[08:37] <morgue> weedar, on step 2 it says - Install the kernel-headers 2.6.10 for i386 from synaptic, and the kernel sources.

[08:39] <amir> do I save and exit out Jordan?
[08:39] <jordan> amir: yup
[08:39] <morgue> wastrel, kk thanks :)
[08:39] <weedar> morgue: the howto was probably written when the kernel version was 2.6.10, at the moment it is either 2.6.15-27 for dapper or 2.6.17 (i think) for edgy
[08:39] <scamboy> so how is edgy???
[08:39] <morgue> 6.10 is edgy right?
[08:39] <amir> jordan: alright what is next then?
[08:40] <scamboy> better or worse??

[08:42] <amir> question, what does sudo mean?
[08:42] <avalon> I'm having problems upgrading to edgy from dapper. I've tried doing the dist-upgrade after changing my sources list and that completely fawked everything up. Now I can't even get my linux to boot. I've got my CD of edgy now though. Can I tell it to install over what I screwed up without losing my home directory and my files?
[08:42] <fgxn> amir: It's a command to run things as root
[08:42] <jordan> amir: I think the key didn't download for some reason, try again
[08:42] <jordan> !sudo
[08:42] <fgxn> amir: "man sudo" for more
[08:43] <fgxn> avalon: Is your home directory on its own partition?
[08:43] <avalon> It's on the same drive as the install of ubuntu
[08:43] <avalon> which is it's own partition.
[08:43] <amir> alright so sudo is telling it to do something
[08:43] <fgxn> avalon: So all of ubuntu is in one big partition?
[08:43] <avalon> yes
[08:44] <amir> alright so sudo is telling it to do something?
[08:44] <fgxn> amir: Specifically, telling it to do something as root.
[08:44] <scamboy>  avalon: i thinking 2 upgrade 2..
[08:44] <amir> fgxn: another newb question.... root means?
[08:44] <morgue> weedar, when I try sudo apt-get xawtv, I get E: Invalid operation xawtv
[08:44] <fgxn> amir: If you type "foo" at the command line, it runs the program foo. If you type "sudo foo", it runs the command foo as if root were the one running it.
[08:44] <scamboy> amir: main directory
[08:44] <fgxn> amir: The root account is the all-powerful, administrative account.
[08:45] <fgxn> scamboy: Not the directory, the user. :)
[08:45] <weedar> morgue, I bet you'll be able to install the correct package with this command "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.17-10"
[08:45] <user-land2> jordan, is the skype package from plf better then the one from skype ?
[08:45] <jordan> avalon: For future reference, a lot of people have been giving incorrect upgrade instructions, gksu update-manager -c is official, editing your sources.list is less safe
[08:45] <amir> btw, I am completely new to linux, so please excuse me if I ask too many questions fgxn
[08:45] <weedar> morgue, that is because the proper syntax is "sudo apt-get install xawtv", you forgot to add install to your command line
[08:45] <morgue> weedar, linux-headers-2.6.17-10 is already the newest version.
[08:45] <totall_6_7> SUDO = superuser do
[08:45] <scamboy> amir: me too...... hehheeh
[08:45] <jordan> user-land2: No idea, sorry.
[08:45] <weedar> morgue, in that case it is already installed then
[08:45] <amir> fgxn. what about apt-get?
[08:46] <fgxn> amir: ...
[08:46] <morgue> ok i'm doing the xawtv now :D
[08:46] <weedar> :)
[08:46] <fgxn> amir: Type "man apt-get" into your console and read
[08:46] <amir> fgxn: sorry about this, I am curious by nature
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> hi everybody
[08:46] <jordan> amir: Did the command work the second time?
[08:46] <avalon> I've learned my lesson about editing the sources list... now I'm just hoping I haven't lost my /home. I had VERy valuable files in there.
[08:46] <fgxn> amir: It's ok to be curious, but it's good to do some of the work on your own as well.
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <prabhatitbhu> how we get freedom for ubuntu?
[08:46] <scamboy>  prabh: hi..
[08:47] <fgxn> amir: It doesn't make sense for me to transcribe manpages into #ubuntu
[08:47] <morgue> weedar, now with this one i get apt-get gcc-3.4
[08:47] <morgue> weedar, gcc-3.4 is already the newest version.
[08:47] <amir> jordan: I didnt try, I am going to install kubuntu onto my notebook so working on it is kinda useless
[08:47] <fgxn> ubuntu needs freedom?
[08:47] <glatzor> avalon: only backuped files are important. :)
[08:47] <amir> oh ok, I didnt know I can use man apy-get to get info on it
[08:47] <glatzor> avalon: what happend during your upgrade?
[08:47] <scamboy>  fgxn: ubuntu is fredoom..
[08:47] <fgxn> amir: You can use "man <any command at all>" to get info on it
[08:47] <scheuri> g'day all
[08:48] <weedar> morgue, when it says it is already newest version that just means you already have it installed, no problem :)
[08:48] <fgxn> scamboy: I'm just wondering what the slavering lunatic was on about
[08:48] <weedar> morgue, which of the howtos are you following by he way? :)

[08:48] <scamboy> guys, will i loose all my document on upgrade??
[08:48] <morgue> weedar, I'm on the "extract drivers" part
[08:48] <avalon> Well... I got a BUNCH of errors, now I can't get x to start. I get the new startup screens and everything, but now I get a x error talking about no screens found. I tried to apt-get install xserver-xorg and it says it's already the newest version
[08:48] <scheuri> scamboy: what documents? what upgrade from where to where?
[08:48] <kuja> Hm, I just saw "Feisty" listed in packages.ubuntu.com while searching for packages. Feisty is the next release, eh? What's the full name?
[08:49] <jordan> fgxn: Maybe a troll, mabe PLF ?
[08:49] <Madpilot> kuja, Feisty Fawn
[08:49] <kuja> Great, thanks.

[08:49] <scheuri> scamboy: whatever you answer is....BACKUP is always important! never do something big without backup!
[08:49] <weedar> avalon, maybe try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:49] <fgxn> jordan: Palestinian Liberation Front?
[08:49] <jordan> fgxn: penguin liberation front
[08:49] <fgxn> jordan: o.O
[08:49] <glatzor> avalon: I would not suggest to newly install the system without formating it before
[08:49] <fgxn> people have too much free time
[08:49] <avalon> I'll try that now weedar
[08:49] <kuja> Anyone know how to have movies playing perfectly in Xgl?
[08:50] <jordan> fgxn: repository for packages of questioable legality, like win32codecs
[08:50] <scamboy> scheuri: 5.10 to breezy....my documents, files...will i loose it??
[08:50] <glatzor> avalon: Boot using the desktop(live)-cd and backup your data
[08:50] <scamboy> or should i go to edgy? is it stable ?????
[08:50] <glatzor> kuja: you have to disable hardware overlay (xv)
[08:50] <kuja> And I can still get the effects of compiz?
[08:50] <scheuri> scamboy: 5.10 is breezy....actually...but you should not lose anything if you make an upgrade (and not a new install), but BACK IT UP anyway!
[08:51] <glatzor> kuja: disable xv in the media player :)
[08:51] <glatzor> kuja: run gstreamer-properties and choose x11
[08:51] <scamboy> scheuri: means download binary update to archive and not to cd right??
[08:51] <kuja> glatzor: Ah hm, what if I was using VLC?
[08:51] <morgue> weedar, when I runned  export CC=gcc-3.4 nothing happened
[08:51] <glatzor> then you have to refer to the manual
[08:52] <glatzor> kuja: look for changing the output plugin
[08:52] <kuja> Hm, okay.
[08:52] <scheuri> scamboy: yes...you log in to your machine and to a upgrade via internet and not downloading the CD and install from new...
[08:52] <andreasn> eek, I cant log into my system, gdm starts correct, but when I try to log in, it shows me a blank screen and restarts gdm
[08:52] <scheuri> scamboy: but still...make a backup of your data!!
[08:52] <andreasn> anyone else who had run into this?
[08:52] <weedar> morgue, nothing is supposed to happen, really. What you are doing when you run that command is tell the shell/konsole that the variable CC is set to the value "gcc-3.4"
[08:52] <scamboy> scheuri: thanks...where u frm? japan?
[08:52] <weedar> morgue, this variable (CC) tells scripts which compiler to use
[08:52] <glatzor> andreasn: add a new user and try this one
[08:52] <scheuri> scamboy: why? no...
[08:52] <morgue> weedar, how do i run quickcam.sh?
[08:53] <andreasn> glatzor: good idea.
[08:53] <morgue> I'm @ the directory where the file is
[08:53] <weedar> morgue, well you did download the drivers from the link, correct?
[08:53] <morgue> yes
[08:53] <morgue> extracted
[08:53] <glatzor> andreasn: perhaps your hard disc is full
[08:53] <jordan> morgue: ./quickcam.sh , use sudo if it needs it
[08:53] <scamboy> Scheuri: juz curious....there r linux users all over the world without read ads....hehehe
[08:53] <kuja> glatzor: Ah yes, maybe I can have VLC have output set as opengl
[08:54] <fgxn> Madpilot: What happened there?
[08:54] <scheuri> scamboy: without read ads? sorry...did not get that...however....backup your data and then modify your sources.list from whatever release you have to the next and make an "sudo aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade"
[08:54] <scamboy> IS IT POSSIBLE TO INSTAL A PROGRAM MANUAL? NOT FRM APT-GET...???
[08:54] <morgue> weedar, wuju!
[08:54] <Madpilot> fgxn, known ban-evader
[08:54] <andreasn> glatzor: hm, is the command for checking that in the console?
[08:54] <morgue> jordan, thanks
[08:54] <fgxn> Ah
[08:54] <morgue> it's working
[08:54] <morgue> omg
[08:54] <fgxn> scamboy: Sure
[08:54] <scheuri> scamboy: STOP SHOUTING
[08:55] <glatzor> andreasn: df -h

[08:55] <andreasn> glatzor: ah, that seems to be it
[08:55] <glatzor> andreasn: apt-get clean
[08:55] <scheuri> morgue: ehmm...did you just happen to make a Logitech Webcam working?
[08:55] <scamboy> scheuri: u heard that sorry......ads? i mean without promoting as microsoft...hehehe
[08:55] <glatzor> andreasn: this removes all the packages from your local cache
[08:55] <kuja> Does anyone know of a gameboy emulator for Ubuntu that I can use to play ROMs (legal ones in the public domain)
[08:56] <morgue> scheuri, yeah
[08:56] <scheuri> morgue: care to share your knowledge?
[08:56] <scheuri> morgue: I have an old one at home which surely could be revived...
[08:56] <morgue> scheuri, I'll do my best
[08:56] <scamboy> fgxn: wat type of file does the setup need to be? exe? deb?tar?
[08:56] <weedar> scheuri: there is a howto for the quickcam messenger here - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=111225&highlight=quickcam+messenger
[08:56] <morgue> sure, what webcam do you have?

[08:58] <andreasn> rock and roll!
[08:58] <ikor> thanks
[08:58] <morgue> scheuri, easycam2 does everything, you don't even need to download the drivers, if it's supported that is
[08:58] <crass> kuja: I see several: gngb, mednafen, xmess
[08:59] <scheuri> morgue: ah, okay...great
[08:59] <kuja> Thanks... I really need to have my Apt4r library complete so I can browse apt packages and download (including dependencies) on any system.
[08:59] <crass> so does anyone know anything about the boot process of ubuntu?
[08:59] <scamboy> crass: wat u mean??
[09:00] <ikor> Audacity gave 'Host error' on first launch. niiice..
[09:00] <avalon> gah.... why can't i just do something nice like set it to VESA and have it work? It returns a nice no screens found error STILL...
[09:00] <Unimatrix9> hi there
[09:00] <scamboy>  anyone using edgy??
[09:00] <crass> scamboy: I'm trying to find where to change the default runlevel (ie the one re go into from boot)
[09:00] <fgxn> scamboy: sure
[09:01] <crass> I'm using edgy
[09:01] <Unimatrix9> ordering cdroms via ship it, it does not get accepted, where could i get more info?
[09:01] <fgxn> crass: I was wondering about that as well. /etc/inittab is gone...
[09:01] <crass> fgxn: its not using upstart
[09:01] <CheetahMk4> I don't suppose anyone is still awake right now?
[09:01] <Unimatrix9> i am running out of ubuntu cdroms to distribute at local computer club...
[09:01] <scamboy>  crass: any good or special improvement???
[09:01] <crass> err, *now
[09:01] <scheuri> CheetahMk4: hey now there...sure we are awake
[09:01] <crass> scamboy: don't know since I didn't use the previous one much
[09:02] <scamboy> crass: hmn....
[09:02] <CheetahMk4> Heh, fellow geek-dom knows no timezone : ) I'll wait till someone is free. I was having a problem with my Xorg drivers, I think my AGP GART got buggered up.
[09:02] <crass> fgxn: see: http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/08/26/upstart-in-universe
[09:03] <scheuri> CheetahMk4: I am not too much into xorg, but...did you manually change the config-file?
[09:03] <Unimatrix9> i get This request was not approved, so no CDs were shipped. the whole time, any one else have the same problem?
[09:03] <crass> but the only way I can see of changing the default runlevel is in /etc/event.d/rc-default, but that is super hackish
[09:03] <morgue> weedar, sound recorder isn't picking up anything, I know the pic is wokring 'cause on skype I can use it, any ideas?
[09:03] <morgue> the mic*
[09:03] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: how many CDs did you order already?
[09:04] <scamboy> unumatrix9: maybe u request a lot...hehehe
[09:04] <Unimatrix9> scheuri, 20 and now ten
[09:04] <CheetahMk4> yeah. The problem is in windows too, so I think it is hardware related. Basically, whenever any type of 'DRI' happens, I get a BSOD with the ATI driver (WindowS) or just a black screen where there should be login (Ubuntu Edgy w/ 'Radeon' driver).
[09:04] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: I dont know, but maybe there is a "limit"?
[09:04] <Unimatrix9> the 20 i got, and distributed, the 10 not
[09:04] <fgxn> crass: You mean it *is* using upstart, not "it's not using upstart", right?
[09:04] <Unimatrix9> could be, do you know?
[09:04] <scamboy> unu: then location problem..
[09:05] <weedar> morgue, what microphone are you using, is there one built-in on the webcam?
[09:05] <scheuri> CheetahMk4: so you installed the binary from ati or are you using the opensource driver?
[09:05] <morgue> weedar, yes
[09:05] <Unimatrix9> if thats so, i am finished advocating ubuntu
[09:05] <ndowens> Unimatrix9: gah, u got alot out lol
[09:05] <crass> fgxn: yeah, I meant to say: "its _now_ using upstart"
[09:05] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: why?
[09:05] <weedar> Unimatrix9: buy some recordable CDs and make them yourself
[09:05] <Unimatrix9> no cdroms, no installs
[09:05] <CheetahMk4> scheuri: Open source, 'ati' 'radeon' FreedesktopDRI driver.
[09:05] <scamboy> Unimatrix: maybe u live out of the coverage..
[09:05] <crass> fgxn: can you msg me the contents of your /etc/event.d/rc-default
[09:05] <Unimatrix9> yes
[09:06] <crass> I think mine minght have gotten changed
[09:06] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: well, you cant blame canonical...I dont know how many "idiots" out there bought dozens for no reason
[09:06] <scheuri> CheetahMk4: oh, okay...well then...I am out of ideas...very sorry
[09:06] <kholerabbit> does metacity have any 3d effects?
[09:06] <scamboy> scheuri: i am 1 of it..hehehehe
[09:06] <CheetahMk4> no problem. I'll try asking in the beryl place.
[09:06] <scamboy> scheuri: but i distribute it for free..
[09:07] <Unimatrix9> its very populair where i distribute
[09:07] <fgxn> crass: uh...hold on, I have to register
[09:07] <Unimatrix9> thats for sure!
[09:07] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: well, asking those people to get them too? or others now using ubuntu to order them for you?
[09:07] <morgue> weedar, on volume control, on file ->  change device, I get 0: HDA Intel (Alsa Mixer), 1: Camera (Alsa Mixer) and 2: Generic 14f1 ID 5047 (OSS Mixer), I choose camera and try to record but nothing is recorded
[09:07] <crass> fgxn: you shouldn't have to register just to do a dcc chat or priv msg
[09:07] <Unimatrix9> fooling the system...
[09:07] <Unimatrix9> :)
[09:08] <fgxn> crass: You have to set a mode (+E?) to make it so I can message you without being registered
[09:08] <scheuri> Unimatrix9: well, not exactly...the limit (if there is one, though) is only to prevent one person to scam them....but if others are ordering too, there is no problem
[09:08] <crass> fgxn: hmm, didn't know that, thanks, it looks exactly like mine
[09:08] <Unimatrix9> i will consider all options, to get it going again
[09:09] <weedar> morgue: hm, I can't seem to find anything on the 'Net about that microphone...does it use a separate cable?
[09:09] <jordan> Unimatrix9: If you explain to them they will probably be fine.
[09:09] <Neocortex> Hi ALL, does anyone has experience with synce? I need an explanation and help, if possible ...
[09:09] <crass> fgxn: I'm having an issue where its booting into runlevel 2 (no gdm/X), but I want to to boot into 3-5, like it normally does on installl
[09:09] <Unimatrix9> ok, i will do that...
[09:09] <scamboy> unimatrix9: u can always download n burn.....takes some 3 hours on lan hahahahaa
[09:09] <morgue> weedar, no, it's built-in, but as i said, on skype it works perfectly, i just can't get sound recorder to record a thing
[09:10] <jordan> Unimatrix9: I am kind of pissed off at a friend who ordered 500 claiming he was a school principle, he used them as frizbees, I stole and distributed them :)
[09:10] <scamboy> morgue: i think driver problem...or app problem..
[09:10] <Unimatrix9> yes, well i am thinking of setting up an ubuntu toaster, a pc, where you can burn your own ubuntu iso
[09:10] <weedar> morgue: I have a separate usb microhpone myself, I had trouble using it for anything else than skype
[09:10] <scheuri> jordan: I, for one, thank you!
[09:10] <fgxn> crass: Did you poke around in /etc/rc2? Because I had to manually remove /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm
[09:10] <Unimatrix9> jordan where do you live?
[09:10] <jordan> Unimatrix9: California
[09:10] <Unimatrix9> ha, thats not around the corner, to bad..
[09:11] <fgxn> crass: Based on that thing I just sent you, it looks like if you create a classic /etc/inittab, it will honor that
[09:11] <Unimatrix9> i live in the netherlands
[09:11] <Unimatrix9> :)
[09:11] <kholerabbit> edgy doesn't seem to have beagle.. didn't dapper have it by default?
[09:11] <morgue> scamboy, if it were a driver problem don't you think it wouldn't work on skype?
[09:11] <Neocortex> Hi ALL, does anyone has experience with synce? I need an explanation and help, if possible ...
[09:11] <jordan> Unimatrix9: They are breezyCD's anyways, it was a while ago.

[09:11] <scheuri> kholerabbit: try packages.ubuntu.com and search there
[09:11] <morgue> weedar, so what should i try?
[09:11] <scheuri> kholerabbit: maybe you are missing a repository
[09:11] <Unimatrix9> i used LTS 6.06 for distribution
[09:11] <scamboy> morgue: i juz guess...
[09:11] <Unimatrix9> wich was nice, ...

[09:15] <jordan> I think Ubutu is on the other side of the split.
[09:15] <jordan> *ubotu
[09:15] <Badkitty> the split?

[09:15] <fgxn> crass: I've never found an xterm that I'm really happy with, and screen(1) works so well...
[09:15] <ndowens> amir: it may be in apt-get try apt-get install ndiswrapper to see
[09:15] <mooky> evening guys
[09:15] <eSeong> ndowens : not found..
[09:15] <ndowens> hmm hold
[09:16] <Badkitty> You should be able to google it too
[09:16] <eSeong> for the previous version 5.02 below not found which i have been trying..
[09:16] <amir> ndowens: invalid operation ndiswrapper
[09:16] <Badkitty> Which card are you trying to use
[09:16] <eSeong> Im trying with my stupid dwl-122 doenst work
[09:16] <eSeong> Im here to see what solution can be gather more =.=!
[09:16] <ndowens> amir: invalid operation
[09:16] <ndowens> weird hold on a sec amir
[09:17] <jordan> amir: Have you tried anything other than nidis, it should really be a last resort.

[09:17] <Badkitty> Anyone happen to have the wiki link for wireless
[09:17] <crass> fgxn: yeah, screen is essential, but I like some of the things that aren't as nice (to me) in the term, like web browsing and watching videos (and I prefer gui mail clients also)
[09:17] <mooky> I'm looking for some advice on why my desktop which is using dhcp is getting name server information on each dhcp request even though dhcp.conf is not configured to ask for name server updates
[09:18] <amir> jordan: I have sorta, I have checked through tons of forum posts, wikis, and websites Nothing seems to help me with my prediciment. I even emailed a professor at my university who knows linux to help and he never responded
[09:18] <crass> also, I never got used to developing in the shell, I prefer gui syntax highlighing editors
[09:18] <fgxn> crass: I don't use computers much for non-programming. I work about 18 hours per day, so when I can get away from it, I run as far and as fast as I can in the opposite direction.
[09:18] <jordan> amir: What kind of card is it?
[09:18] <crass> fgxn: what do you program?
[09:18] <amir> broadcom 4318
[09:19] <fgxn> crass: Mostly python these days. A lot of C in the distant past, with PHP wedged in the middle.
[09:19] <Badkitty> Amir... they have ndiswrapper for that card with an installation script
[09:19] <jordan> amir: That you should definately be able to get to work without NDIS.
[09:19] <eSeong> amir : i thought card would be easily being found inside ubuntu.
[09:19] <amir> ah! badkitty: where can I find this information so this can finally work
[09:19] <eSeong> Unless u are using usb/etc..
[09:19] <ndowens> amir: what broadcom model was it again?
[09:19] <crass> yeah, I do mostly python these days too, I fell in love with the lang, and do the occaional C/C++
[09:19] <amir> ndowens 4318
[09:19] <Badkitty> Amir: Are you using edgy?
[09:19] <ndowens> ah
[09:20] <amir> kubuntu right now
[09:20] <amir> and edgy
[09:20] <amir> they are both on

[09:20] <Badkitty> oic... ok well is it i386 or 64bit?
[09:20] <amir> i386
[09:20] <morgue> Do you think I could get MVP 2005 running on ubuntu?
[09:20] <ndowens> amir: search apt for ndis and see what it brings up
[09:21] <ndowens> i think it could be apt-get install ndis
[09:21] <fgxn> crass: Just emacs
[09:21] <Hoagie> Hi. I've tried two different Dapper CDs, and a Hoary CD, and I can't get either to boot at startup. I've got the boot priorities set to CD drive in the BIOS. Any ideas?
[09:21] <Badkitty> I have the files he needs with a script
[09:21] <fgxn> crass: With python-mode, of course
[09:21] <jordan> ndowens: I don't think he needs NDIS.
[09:21] <weedar> morgue, I am a bit unsure what to do with the microphone, it seems your set-up is correct. only other thing I can think of is to click the "mute" button to se if it is muted after-all
[09:21] <weedar> morgue, what is mvp 2005?
[09:21] <ndowens> amir: i was in some other channel talking about a laptop and they said it had broadcom card and they said ndiswrapper works
[09:22] <crass> right, I never could bring myself to sit down and learn either of emacs or vim, but at least I know how to exit and save in emacs

[09:22] <ndowens> jordon ^
[09:22] <Badkitty> Hoagie.. hmm that is strange. i've not had any problems.. could be a cd-rom issue?
[09:22] <Badkitty> amir?
[09:22] <amir> ndiswrapper-source came up as not installed, as well as ndiswrapper-utils,1.8 not installed
[09:22] <Badkitty> amir.. I have the files you seek man
[09:22] <Hoagie> Badkitty: If you mean the drive, maybe... It normally whirs like mad, but I can get programs off the disks just fine in windows.
[09:22] <amir> ndowens: there is another type of broadcom card, its a 43xx but diff extension
[09:22] <jordan> ndowens: I personally think NDIS wrapper is a hack, and any braodcom card should work, he just needs firmware.
[09:22] <amir> badkitty: please help me
[09:23] <Badkitty> Amir: is your system i386 or 64-bit?
[09:23] <amir> jordan: anything that gets my wireless up
[09:23] <jordan> amir: Let me get a link to some firmware that
[09:23] <amir> badkitty: i386
[09:23] <morgue> weedar, yeah the mute button is working, just tried it
[09:23] <jordan> amir: Let me get a link to some firmware that might get it working.
[09:23] <amir> jordan: great man thank you
[09:23] <Badkitty> ok I can send it via E-mail
[09:23] <ndowens> amir:  try installing the first coice or ndiswrapper
[09:23] <weedar> morgue, ok you tried it in skype I assume?
[09:23] <ndowens> i think according to a forum all u have to do after is modprobe ndiswrapper or something
[09:24] <ndowens> and it would work
[09:24] <morgue> weedar, yes
[09:24] <amir> and the fact that I cant watch videos on abum in my web browser isnt helping to alleviate the pressure
[09:24] <Badkitty> Try Jordans thing first, and if that doesn't work i have the package ready to go for you with ndiswrapper
[09:24] <amir> badkitty, can you PM me?
[09:24] <Badkitty> Hoagy,. are you sure you burned the file as a bootable iso?
[09:24] <jordan> ndowens: No, NDIS requires setting up the windows drivers also ( I am pretty sure at least )
[09:24] <weedar> morgue, I am actually out of ideas here - as I said I had issues myself with my usb microphone..
[09:24] <Badkitty> I think that could be the problem
[09:25] <atarinox> has anyone else had problems with flash working in firefox 2.0?
[09:25] <atarinox> in 6.10
[09:25] <ndowens> jordan: i have never experienced ndiswrapper bt i am just trying to bring ideas
[09:25] <Hoagie> Badkitty: I got all my CDs from ship-it
[09:25] <crass> atarinox: what problems? I've had none

[09:28] <crass> atarinox: I thought you were talking about some flash sites you were going to, I didn't know there were some in the repository
[09:28] <ndowens> amir: try searching forums for ndiswrapper, jordon don't jump me, just trying to help

[09:33] <niktaris> hi, can I show my hdd automatically on the desktop in gnome 2.16 ? Can I tell gnome to start sorting the icons starting from right ?
[09:33] <amir> jordan, I was supposed to unzip the folder correct?
[09:33] <unclekev> What kernel should i be using if i have a pentium D dual core, is it the smp one ???
[09:33] <jordan> amir: yup, to the desktop.
[09:33] <scamboy> invisible: thanks friend..
[09:33] <Kristy> dunno havent even looked
[09:33] <amir> it unzips a ton of singular files
[09:33] <ndowens> unclekev: any linux kernel will work, just have to configure smp in
[09:33] <ndowens> Kristy: ah
[09:34] <unclekev> ndowens: thanks dude, appreciate it :)
[09:34] <jordan> amir: They are all be in a folder called firmware though right?
[09:34] <crass> atarinox: it looks like if you start with the -g or -debug option it will run in a debugger
[09:35] <amir> I am entering the command, but nothing is coming up, jordan
[09:35] <amir> jordan: it is just showing the next line
[09:35] <jordan> amir: Thats Ok, there shouldn't be any output.
[09:36] <amir> jordan: oops alright then. I did that
[09:36] <amir> jordan: whats next?
[09:36] <Commander-Crowe> yeah no one in ubuntu-xgl will answer me
[09:36] <atarinox> crass: you mean in the terminal: firefox -d
[09:36] <mooky> Commander-Crowe then wait
[09:36] <atarinox> doesnt seem to give me anything..unless it's logging somewhere
[09:36] <jordan> amir: OK, now try: sudo modprobe bcm43xx and if that doesn't work restart.
[09:36] <mooky> ubuntu-xgl is the correct palce
[09:36] <mooky> place
[09:37] <amir> I entered it, there was no output
[09:37] <amir> jordan: I entered it, no output
[09:37] <jordan> amir: that is OK, try connecting.
[09:37] <crass> atarinox: no, firefox -g or firefox -debug
[09:37] <amir> jordan: what wireless manager should I use to connect?
[09:37] <nicholaspaul> Q: i'm trying to erase the ubuntu partition on my ppc laptop...which partitions should i leave alone (ie. the OSX side) ?
[09:38] <jordan> amir: network-admin
[09:38] <atarinox> crass: /usr/bin/firefox: line 163: gdb: command not found
[09:38] <atarinox> crass: same message with -g and -debug
[09:38] <amir> jordan: is network admin under system?
[09:38] <nicholaspaul> i know that 6 is the linux one, 7 the swap...but what about an hfs labelled 'external boot' ?
[09:38] <jordan> amir: Oh, never mind, that is for gnome.
[09:38] <crass> atarinox: yeah, that means you don't have the gnu debugger on your system
[09:39] <amir> jordan: you are a genius. the network settings has found a wireless card
[09:39] <Schalken> is there a way to change ubuntu to/form kubuntu without reinstalling?
[09:39] <tlex> oh
[09:39] <tlex> oh year!~!!!
[09:39] <Cimi> Schalken, install kubuntu-artwork and something similar
[09:39] <tlex> 
[09:39] <tlex> 
[09:40] <Badkitty> Nicholaspaul hmmm.. not sure haven't seen that before.. There should just be two drives the / and the swap
[09:40] <jordan> amir: Look in the KDE menu, I think the application has wireless in the name ( again I don't use KDE often )
[09:40] <tlex> 
[09:40] <hrach> please i couldnt find the answer in google what does it mean this:  cdrom confused;  try booting with the irqpoll option
[09:40] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: so dya think OSX is only using the hfs labelled Appl_HFS?
[09:40] <nicholaspaul> (or Apple_HFS)
[09:40] <crass> atarinox: when I said debug mode, I didn't mean a verbose mode, where it would print out debug output, but in debug mode it allows you to debug the program on an abnomal exit
[09:40] <jordan> amir: You don't have network-admin because you have kubuntu, you have something else and I don't remember the name.
[09:41] <Elive_user60> Does ubuntu Edgy support passwordless resume from hibernate?
[09:41] <kholerabbit> should I install "Search" or "Kerry Beagle"?
[09:41] <Badkitty> Im not sure about OSX I have never ran it. But if your partitioning or formatting.. there should just be the two linux drives. What exactly are you doing again?
[09:41] <eSeong> 
[09:42] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: reformatting the linux drives for OSX
[09:42] <Bonez56> hi all, i have an ibm 300 series server. i have installed ubuntu and brought up eth0, assigned it an IP address etc, however, it when I try to ping another machine on the LAN it says: Reply from "insert IP of the ubuntu server - ie, itself" - Destination Host Unreachable. Can anyone help?
[09:42] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: or rather, erasing that partition.
[09:42] <Flannel> tlex: /join #ubuntu-ch
[09:42] <Elive_user60> anybody tried hibernate under edgy?
[09:42] <mooky> Bonez56 is your routing ok
[09:42] <crass> Bonez56: that usually means that you don't have the netmask correct (ie you're on a different ip network)
[09:42] <Badkitty> Got ya.. You killing linux eh?
[09:43] <mooky> Elive_user60 you asked less than 60 seconds ago - wait for an answer, there is enough noise in this channel
[09:43] <ndowens> Bonez56: check to see if u have dns configured /etc/resolv.conf
[09:43] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: just on my Powerbook. I'm keeping it on everything else :)
[09:43] <amir> jordan: I have a wireless assistant that works great.
[09:43] <Bonez56> crass, yes the netmask is working. I have a /29 from my ISP (8 IP addresses) - yes dns is configured, the rest of the LAN is perfect
[09:43] <Bonez56> crass, for me it's 255.255.255.248 for /29
[09:43] <amir> jordan: do you know much about networking?
[09:43] <crass> dns has nothing to do with it
[09:43] <Bonez56> crass, it's all set up properly
[09:43] <Badkitty> It should just be the two then...
[09:43] <Badkitty> Amir: You get it working?
[09:43] <mooky> Bonez56 routing ?
[09:43] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: alrighty. Thanks :-)
[09:43] <morgue> Do you think I could get MVP 2005 running on ubuntu? It's a baseball game from EA Sports (windows only)
[09:44] <Elive_user60> mooky: well instead of ticking me off and creating more unwanted noise you could've answered my question
[09:44] <mooky> morgue are you serious
[09:44] <jordan> amir: Not a whole lot.
[09:44] <Bonez56> mooky, yes it's fine. i'm going to try enabling DHCP on my router and see if it can assign an IP
[09:44] <atarinox> crass: talking way above my understanding w/ " I didn't mean a verbose mode,
[09:44] <atarinox>                where it would print out debug output, but in debug mode it
[09:44] <atarinox>                allows you to debug the program on an abnomal exit
[09:44] <mooky> Elive_user60 I didn't know the answer - so I didn't respond
[09:44] <crass> Bonez56: next is routing, maybe you don't have  adefault route
[09:44] <yakumo> what lib do i need to install to have a thesaurus on my open office word proccessor?, im using dapper drake
[09:44] <Bonez56> crass, how do I add a default route?
[09:44] <jordan> amir: So you can connect now?
[09:44] <morgue> mooky, 100% :)
[09:44] <mooky> Bonez56 check the output of ifconfig and ip addr match
[09:44] <amir> badkitty: not yet, I dont know much about networking so I am figuring this part out. On XP all I had to do was enter my network password, but this is different I think.
[09:44] <morgue> mooky, impossible? :)
[09:44] <crass> Bonez56: route add default gw <ip of gateway>
[09:44] <amir> jordan: it has my wireless device now I just need the correct network info
[09:44] <mooky> morgue windows only - use wine or some other emmulatation style software
[09:45] <kholerabbit> I am using Edgy livecd. There is no Beagle. The Add/Remove app has packages "Search" and "Kerry Beagle" which one do I install?
[09:45] <Bonez56> crass, i just tried that, it still says host unreachable
[09:45] <crass> atarinox: well you can disregard it, just install gdb and run firefox -g, when it crashes type "bt" in the terms
[09:45] <morgue> mooky, what i'm worried about is the setup, i'd use wine for that too?
[09:45] <crass> Bonez56: can you ping your gateway?
[09:45] <mooky> morgue setup of what ?
[09:45] <jordan> amir: What info is it asking for, and do you know the name of your wireless network?
[09:45] <Bonez56> crass, no, that is the problem
[09:45] <morgue> mooky, the game's setup
[09:46] <mooky> morgue errrrr if its running you'd set it up like you would do if its running in windows
[09:46] <crass> Bonez56: what is the output of "route"
[09:46] <crass> and what is the ip of your gateway?
[09:46] <amir> jordan: AmGoodNetwork, but my network key is 616d676f64, but the password I would use in XP was amgod.
[09:46] <atarinox> crass: ok i tried firefox -g, but firefox didnt launch...do i just launch if outside the terminal and go to youtube, then when it crashes go back to the terminal and type bt?
[09:46] <Bonez56> crass, it outputs nothing
[09:46] <kuja> Can anyone estimate how badly a Debian system will break after pointing the repositories to Edgy and performing an upgrade? :)
[09:46] <amir> jordan: do I enter the network key or the password since I have a WEP code?
[09:46] <shinobi2> what is command line to open nautilus from command line in kde?
[09:47] <morgue> mooky, why did you ask me if i was serious?
[09:47] <crass> atarinox: did you install gdb?
[09:47] <mooky> kuja terrible
[09:47] <Flannel> kuja: it probably  be pretty
[09:47] <atarinox> crass: yeah...
[09:47] <Flannel> kuja: er, probably wont be pretty
[09:47] <Badkitty> network key
[09:47] <crass> Bonez56: you have serious issues if it outputs _nothing_
[09:47] <mooky> morgue because you asked if it was possible to get a windows only app running under a linux distribution
[09:47] <Badkitty> no .'s
[09:47] <DraconPern> has anyone gotten ati+glx+beryl to work?
[09:47] <kuja> Is it possible to sandbox apt by repositories?
[09:47] <Bonez56> crass, it outputs the standard "Kernel IP routing tables blah blah" but there is actually no IP addresses or routes
[09:47] <Flannel> shinobi2: you want nautilus? or konqueror?
[09:48] <mooky> DraconPern join #ubuntu-xgl
[09:48] <amir> Badkitty: use my network key, not the password I used in XP?
[09:48] <jordan> amir: as Badkitty says, the network key.
[09:48] <crass> atarinox: no, launch it in the terminal, and go to youtube
[09:48] <kuja> I want to use apt to grab packages including dependencies
[09:48] <mooky> Bonez56 therei s your problem
[09:48] <amir> its telling me connection failed, badkitty?
[09:48] <mooky> thats why I asked about your routing setup
[09:48] <amir> badkitty: no ?, oops
[09:48] <Bonez56> mooky, but i can not even ping other PC's on the same subnet or the router...
[09:48] <dxdemetriou> when I make update with synaptic or software updates, some times goes out of memory and kills some running programs. Anybody have the same problem?
[09:48] <crass> Bonez56: and you did: route add default gw <i of gateway>?
[09:48] <shinobi2> Flannel: never mind, got it
[09:48] <mooky> Bonez56 default route !
[09:48] <Bonez56> crass, yes i did, let me try again
[09:48] <morgue> mooky, i'm going to download it and then you'll help me getting it to work :O
[09:49] <mooky> morgue no
[09:49] <Badkitty> lol
[09:49] <morgue> mooky, :(
[09:49] <Bonez56> mooky, i should not need a default route if i am just trying to ping other PC's on the same subnet and the same LAN should I?
[09:49] <mooky> Bonez56 yes you do
[09:49] <amir> badkitty: will it still work if I have a wired connection plugged in?
[09:49] <atarinox> crass: firefox -g and firefox -debug just brings up some gdb info and a (gdb) prompt in the terminal...doesnt launch firefox
[09:49] <Bonez56> mooky, well there you go! ill test it now
[09:49] <morgue> mooky, why :(
[09:49] <Bonez56> stand by crass im just going to test it
[09:49] <crass> atarinox: oh, then in there type "run" and enter
[09:50] <mooky> morgue a.) I don't like playing with wine b.) I don't think you'll get it working c.) you sound too basic with linux to be messing with wine so I can't be bothered
[09:50] <Badkitty> ummm. i am not sure if there is something you have to do to use both at once...
[09:50] <^Down> is there a command to get the MD5 checksum of a file?
[09:50] <Badkitty> I would test it unwired first
[09:50] <mooky> Down md5chk
[09:50] <^Down> Thanks
[09:50] <ndowens> i would just give ndiswrapper a try if i was u, i have never done it but ppl say it works
[09:50] <amir> ...
[09:51] <^Down> Eh
[09:51] <^Down> Command not found
[09:51] <Badkitty> ive used ndiswrapper.. worked fine
[09:51] <rausb0> ^Down: md5sum filename
[09:51] <mooky> ^Down thats it
[09:51] <morgue> mooky, messing up you leart :D
[09:51] <morgue> learn*
[09:51] <ndowens> wel i never used wireless so no experience, just heard about it
[09:51] <mooky> morgue I don't need to learn
[09:51] <atarinox> crass: The program 'firefox-bin' received an X Window System error.
[09:51] <atarinox> This probably reflects a bug in the program.
[09:51] <atarinox> The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
[09:51] <atarinox>   (Details: serial 114 error_code 8 request_code 144 minor_code 3)
[09:51] <atarinox>   (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
[09:51] <atarinox>    that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
[09:52] <mooky> I'm quite confident with it
[09:52] <ndowens> ndiswrapper that is
[09:52] <crass> mooky: you don't need a default route to contact machines on the same ip network
[09:52] <atarinox>    To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
[09:52] <atarinox>    option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
[09:52] <atarinox>    backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
[09:52] <atarinox> Program exited with code 01.
[09:52] <jordan> Badkitty: Be sure to put his name when you post so your comment is highlighted as being for him.
[09:52] <morgue> mooky, everyone needs to learn :o
[09:52] <DraconPern> is there a way to know if I am running xgl or aiglx? from the command line?
[09:52] <mooky> crass no but if his routing table it totally entry it won't know which IF to go out of
[09:52] <dxdemetriou> anybody knows why when synaptic make install the updates on edgy goes out of memory? I can't do anything because I can't move freely
[09:52] <mooky> if its multiple nick
[09:52] <atarinox> get the backtrace?
[09:52] <mooky> morgue I didn't say they didn't
[09:52] <Badkitty> jordan: ok jordan
[09:52] <ndowens> amir: try ndiswrapper
[09:52] <morgue> mooky, that includes you :D
[09:52] <mooky> morgue what ?
[09:53] <crass> mooky: yes it will, depending on the destination
[09:53] <mooky> I'm not asking to learn about something
[09:53] <morgue> mooky, everyone needs to learn something heh
[09:53] <crass> atarinox: do as it says and run with --sync
[09:53] <nicholaspaul> Badkitty: any idea where Yaboot might be ?
[09:53] <morgue> mooky, it's just a saying, 'messing up you learn'
[09:53] <mooky> crass I stand corrected. I've seen RH boxes refuse to go anywhere wihtout a default route
[09:53] <amir> ndowens: it has found my wireless card...do I still need ndiswrapper for it to connect to the internet?
[09:53] <Badkitty> nicholaspaul.. no idea
[09:53] <mooky> morgue I don't care ?
[09:53] <MikeDK> havin someprobs on gaim systray icon anyone can help???
[09:53] <mooky> I'm not asking to learn

[09:54] <ndowens> amir:  i dunno but i don't think it would hurt to try just in case that firewire wouldn't work exactly like it's suppose to
[09:55] <mooky> nicholaspaul mount them and take a look
[09:55] <ndowens> amir: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31926

[09:55] <harm_> http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/817004
[09:55] <nicholaspaul> mooky: ok. How?
[09:55] <jordan> amir: You might try asking for help in #kubuntu as they would know how to use wireless assistant ( or whatever it's called )
[09:55] <crass> Bonez56: do you have a local network? are you directly connected to you internet source?
[09:55] <MikeDK> havin someprobs on gaim systray icon anyone can help???
[09:55] <mooky> nicholaspaul do a google search

[09:55] <mooky> MikeDK you JUST ASKED

[09:56] <crass> MikeDK: and don't ask to ask ... just _ask_
[09:56] <atarinox> crass: ok i ran it with sync and got a long list of stuff which im not sure what it means
[09:56] <Badkitty> amir: i have the file, but you should try with jordan w/o ndiswrapper first
[09:56] <Bonez56> crass, i have a local network and an ADSL router that handles the subnet. I just rebooted and now I am getting results from "route" can I pm them to you?
[09:56] <crass> atarinox: privmsg me the output
[09:56] <MikeDK> rgr that crass
[09:56] <crass> Bonez56: yes
[09:57] <ndowens> ugh
[09:57] <user-land> system monitor does not report cpu load correctly. time and again, cpu use is 80% and system monitor only shows a few apps at 5% ...
[09:57] <ndowens> amir: there is a part on the bottom that tells about configuring the card as well like setting up for the net
[09:57] <chuckyp> user-land, what type of cpu do you have?
[09:57] <morgue> mooky, kk you don't have to be mean about it though ;)
[09:57] <user-land> amd64, chuckyp
[09:57] <robokop> how can i set java1.5 as my default java jre
[09:57] <Badkitty> ndowens: its a good link for sure, but i have his file with an install script... super easy..
[09:57] <mooky> morgue I'm not being mean ?
[09:57] <mooky> how am I being mean
[09:57] <chuckyp> user-land, which kernel are you using?
[09:58] <ndowens> Badkitty: ah
[09:58] <user-land> edgy standard 32bit, chuckyp.
[09:58] <amir> ndowens: that is for ndiswrapper 1.1. I did find a forum post on broadcom 4318 cards using ndiswrapper
[09:58] <crass> MikeDK: I'm not sure if you understood, so I'm going to make it a little more clear.  When you ask for help, give some information about the specific problem (like what is happening with gaim systray icon?)
[09:58] <chuckyp> user-land, try the linux-image-generic package
[09:58] <ndowens> Badkitty: never learned how to script yet
[09:58] <jordan> amir: I forgot, you may need to restart for the new firmware to work.
[09:58] <amir> alright
[09:58] <amir> jordan: alright
[09:58] <chuckyp> !info linux-image-generic
[09:58] <ndowens> why would amir have to restart, that is for windows ppl
[09:58] <morgue> mooky, saying no i won't help you and things like that, maybe not but it's how i saw it :)
[09:58] <harm_> what the hell is clamav its some prgm which keep erroring up

[09:59] <jordan> harm_: It's an anti-virus program.
[09:59] <dxdemetriou> anybody have problem with synaptic that goes out of memory during the installation?
[09:59] <chuckyp> user-land, what do you mean by expert?
[09:59] <Bonez56> atarinox, /msg username text
[09:59] <mooky> morgue you asked me for help with wine, I said no, and gave 3 reasons. 1.) I don't like playing with wine 2.) I don't think you'll get it working 3.) I don't think your advanced enough with linux to be messing with wine
[09:59] <mooky> thats not being mine
[09:59] <Badkitty> ndowens: me neither. I had to use the file before though :-)
[09:59] <harm_> chuckyp and jordan thanks.. it deleted now

[09:59] <crass> atarinox: /msg crass
[09:59] <fatherfork> What version of the linux kernel is ubuntu based on?
[09:59] <chuckyp> user-land, I just know the generic package would be a better kernel for your cpu if you don't want to run 64bit.
[09:59] <ndowens> Badkitty: heh
[09:59] <mooky> fatherfork 2.6.15
[09:59] <robokop> how can i set java1.5 as my default java jre

[10:03] <Flannel> UmbraAdmin: you'll want to go through 6.06 as an intermediary
[10:03] <chuckyp> UmbraAdmin, actually you should update to dapper first I believe.
[10:03] <DBO> atarinox, use pastebin to paste from now on, ok? =)
[10:03] <DBO> !paste | atarinox
[10:03] <Badkitty> I==UmbraAdmin... I believe so.. never done that though
[10:03] <Flannel> DBO: no ubotu
[10:03] <UmbraAdmin> oki
[10:03] <DBO> oh right, ubotu is gone
[10:03] <chuckyp> DBO, I think ubotu is down

[10:04] <UmbraAdmin> gues ill try
[10:04] <atarinox> why can't I send a priv message?
[10:04] <atarinox> is there a diff command for irssi?
[10:04] <Bonez56> atarinox, you need to register - /msg nickserv help
[10:04] <Badkitty> Hey jordan, you think you could help me try and get my wireless card working?
[10:04] <chuckyp> atarinox, you have to register you nick with nickserv
[10:04] <atarinox> yeah i will in a bit
[10:04] <atarinox> chillllllllll
[10:05] <jordan> Badkitty: Possibly
[10:05] <jordan> Badkitty: What kind is it?
[10:05] <DBO> atarinox, what they mean is you cant PM without registering first
[10:05] <atarinox> ohhhh
[10:05] <Badkitty> I gave up on the linksys card and got a netgear card
[10:05] <chuckyp> atarinox, what are you trying to compile?
[10:05] <atarinox> nothing...trying to send my debug info to crass
[10:05] <luciddream> I just started playing with screen and realized I had inadvertently created a bunch of sessions without knowing what I was doing.  I then figured I'd wipe them out by doing "rm /var/run/screen/S-adam/*" which I'm now realizing was maybe not so smart.  Apparently the sessions are still "alive" but I can't reattach to them now -- any advice?
[10:05] <Badkitty> It's a netgear Wg311t
[10:05] <Flannel> atarinox: you can't query on Freenode unless you're registered/identified to services
[10:05] <mooky> I hate that "chiiiiiiilllll"
[10:06] <mooky> you are rude to channel users
[10:06] <mooky> and come in saying "chiiiiiillll"
[10:06] <livingdaylight> quicktime movies are viewable in Ubuntu?
[10:06] <chuckyp> luciddream, kill the pids
[10:06] <livingdaylight> They seem the hardest to access :|
[10:06] <Badkitty> luciddream: where you from?
[10:06] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, with the proper codecs
[10:06] <luciddream> chuckyp: ps -a doesn't show me anything
[10:06] <luciddream> Badkitty: vancouver BC
[10:06] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: i have all the codecs imaginable :|
[10:06] <chuckyp> luciddream, has to show screen running
[10:06] <MikeDK> livingdayligt use VLC i think
[10:07] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, well I can play guicktime here.
[10:07] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: ok, tell me, which?
[10:07] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, vlc is also a vaible option plays everything.  without the need for codec.
[10:07] <jordan> Badkitty: If it is a broadcom card, I can help, otherwise all I can suggest is to try installing restricted modules.
[10:07] <cntb> !fax > cntb
[10:07] <livingdaylight> VLC?!
[10:07] <livingdaylight> !vlc
[10:07] <luciddream> chuckyp: it doesn't... I'm sort of at a loss
[10:07] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, yeah vlc  videolan client.
[10:07] <Badkitty> luciddream: ohh cool. A group of my friends were using the word lucid+name a while back for a bunch of projects we were working on
[10:08] <chuckyp> luciddream, well then how do you know they are still running?
[10:08] <cntb> !fax
[10:08] <Badkitty> Jordan: i was hoping I could get the card working without resorting to ndiswrapper
[10:08] <chuckyp> cntb, ubotu is down right now.
[10:08] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: so, i have missing codecs or just the wrong player?
[10:08] <MikeDK> livingdaylight just hit the terminal and write sudo apt-get install vlc
[10:08] <jordan> Badkitty: Try: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic
[10:08] <chuckyp> Badkitty, perhaps check help.ubuntu.com  for directions on your card to see if it is needed.
[10:08] <cntb> ty chuckyp any particular reason ?
[10:09] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, sounds like missing cocecs.   Or you could use vlc and not worry about codecs.
[10:09] <chuckyp> cntb, no idea
[10:09] <luciddream> chuckyp: I don't have the technical proficiency to really explain this but in one of the screen sessions I was running a java server on port 8880.  Now when I try to run it again it tells me the port is in use.
[10:09] <mabreaux> I am running ubuntu with Kde loaded.  why when I start the system do the start up screens say kubuntu?
[10:09] <chuckyp> luciddream, did you ps aux | grep screen  or ps aux | grep java
[10:09] <jordan> Badkitty: You may need to add the restricted repository to install linux-restricted-modules-generic
[10:09] <cntb> anyone using fax in ubuntu ?
[10:09] <MikeDK> crass???
[10:09] <Badkitty> I don't have a wired connection
[10:09] <MikeDK> crass you here??
[10:09] <chuckyp> mabreaux, okay?
[10:09] <crass> MikeDK: yes
[10:10] <mooky> MikeDK CHILL OUT
[10:10] <Badkitty> and its on my desktop
[10:10] <mooky> learn to wait more than 10 seconds
[10:10] <kuja> mabreaux: Perhaps you install kubuntu
[10:10] <luciddream> chuckyp: I'm unfamiliar with ps aux but it just spat out a TON of stuff -- this is a good starting point for me, thanks!
[10:10] <Badkitty> Follow the link from here jordan: http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_part.php?brandname=Netgear
[10:10] <livingdaylight> VLC installed!!!
[10:10] <MikeDK> crass, mooky, ssry but real ancious to get it to work
[10:10] <jordan> Badkitty: Ok, you can download the .debs and transfer them to a flash drive ( note this is just a stab in the dark anyways )
[10:11] <mooky> MikeDK its gaim IM - its not life or death
[10:11] <chuckyp> luciddream, yeah ps aux then use the |  symbol and grep <name of app>  so "ps aux | grep <name of app>"   without quotes of course.
[10:11] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: still would like to know what codecs might have been missing coz i thought i fethced them all... but will try vlc anyway
[10:11] <crass> MikeDK: I'm busy atm
[10:11] <MikeDK> mooky oooh lol yar i know
[10:11] <mabreaux> I load the meta : kde desktop so I would have both, how do I switch it back to ubuntu
[10:11] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, well I know if you use all the gstreamer codecs you should be able to handle qt fine.
[10:11] <MikeDK> crass: ok rgr that ill w8 then
[10:11] <livingdaylight> MikeDK: i like the attitude of just getting on with it "just hit the terminal" :D
[10:12] <Badkitty> Hmm.. let me try this madwifi deal.....
[10:12] <MikeDK> livingdaylight yar but im really a newbie my self
[10:12] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: well, some of those got disabled coz i installed totem-xine with libxine-extracodecs coz something else was not working yesterday which this change was a fix for
[10:12] <jordan> Badkitty: Basically, installing the restricted modules will only help if there are proprietary linux drivers for your card ( that is the case for me )
[10:13] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, ahh.   Yeah VLC will work then.
[10:13] <jordan> Badkitty: Other than that I can't help.
[10:14] <LKRaider> !pida
[10:14] <Badkitty> ok Ill do some more research... btw, how do I get the restricted modules if I don't have a wired connection. I have to make sure i get the right one eh?
[10:15] <chuckyp> Badkitty, linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
[10:15] <chuckyp> Badkitty, you would have to dl it from packages.ubuntu.com
[10:15] <Badkitty> But I fi can't do an aot-get should I just google it?
[10:15] <jordan> Badkitty: Do you have another ubuntu machine that can connect?
[10:15] <Badkitty> actually I think so...
[10:15] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: does vlc not have a open location dialog where i can paste in the url in question?
[10:16] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, well there is a vlc plugin for firefox also
[10:16] <luciddream> chuckpy: I found the offending screen processes with ps aux.  I'd been using "ps -a" all this time -- thanks!
[10:16] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, apt-get install mozilla-plugin-vlc
[10:16] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: ah.
[10:17] <Badkitty> It would be a pain in the butt lol...let me check up on this madWifi page...then ill get back if that doesn't work...
[10:17] <Badkitty> thanks.. be back in a bit
[10:17] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, but to answer your question there should be.  Dunno I haven't used vlc in a while.  Which url are you having a problem with?
[10:17] <jordan> Badkitty: never mind, it can be a windows machine also if you download from packages.ubuntu.com
[10:17] <chuckyp> Badkitty, did you go to help.ubuntu.com
[10:17] <chuckyp> Badkitty, they list certain cards on the desktop guide and what neesd to be done to make them work.
[10:18] <livingdaylight> chuckyp:  this url     http://www.tathagata.de/content/view/39/72/lang,en/
[10:18] <sonics> hi

[10:18] <Bokeh> upgrade from?
[10:18] <sonics> dappe
[10:18] <sonics> dapper
[10:18] <MasseR> Desktop or laptop
[10:18] <MasseR> ?
[10:18] <sonics> laptop
[10:18] <cntb> howot diagnose a modem fax and a fax sending/receiving ?
[10:18] <Bokeh> shouldn't be a problem, but make sure you have the latest dapper upgrades as well
[10:19] <MasseR> Don't upgrade
[10:19] <Bokeh> ow, laptop
[10:19] <Badkitty> ill check it out, thanks chuckyp
[10:19] <sonics> why is that MasseR ?
[10:19] <cntb>  s/howot/howto
[10:19] <Bokeh> yeah, just reinstall if you have a laptop :P
[10:19] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, yeah my mplayer won't play it either.   hrm... maybe its qt4  I would definately try vlc and see what you get.
[10:19] <MasseR> sonics: Broke my fans (got them working), broke my ethernet nic, and made it difficult to install graphics drivers
[10:19] <MasseR> I wonder if that's all..
[10:20] <sonics> hahaha, ok :D
[10:20] <sonics> ill stay with dapper .. my laptop is strange anyhow
[10:20] <sonics> vaio sz with 2 grafic chips
[10:20] <MasseR> :P
[10:20] <sonics> I could need some help still
[10:20] <chuckyp> sonics, upgrade dapper fully and then.   use gksu "update-manager -c"    make sure you use the quotes,  you should be fine unless you have third party software etc...
[10:20] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: yea, shame... bloody qt's ....at the mo just struggling getting Firefox to open the url with vlc. Looking in preference to change default client for opening clips
[10:21] <sonics> chuckyp: well, Im a bit new to linux... how to upgrade to dapper fully, whats the command?
[10:21] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, well you could try temporarily renaming the plugins in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/  so that only vlc is there.
[10:21] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: i wish i guys who made dem clips would use a universal format instead of focusing on their mac quicktime clients only
[10:21] <blimey> Chaps, what is "THE" taskbar mail notification applet for Multiple POP(S) accounts? Preferably one that knows how to import accounts from Thunderbird, but if not, I won't shed tears over it.
[10:22] <chuckyp> sonics, just run the update-manager and install any updates   i.e. gksu update-manager
[10:22] <chuckyp> blimey, there are tons.  I believe gmail notify you can add pop accounts
[10:22] <harm_> i have an intel chipset, so can/should i download drivers so i can play unrealtournament with some fps?
[10:22] <crohaxx> hi lads, has it ever occured to you, just before the login screen appears, a black screen appears with an underscore in the top right?
[10:22] <chuckyp> harm_, what video card do you have?
[10:22] <crohaxx> and it stasy stuck ...
[10:23] <chuckyp> crohaxx, not on mine.
[10:23] <harm_> chuckyp intergrated intel i think?
[10:23] <blimey> Yes, chuckyp - choice is good, but sometimes one gets lost with all the options :)
[10:23] <cntb> crohaxx: maybe try to restart X
[10:23] <livingdaylight> blimey: there is mail notification if you search in synaptic
[10:23] <cntb> ctrl alt F1
[10:23] <livingdaylight> gkrill also or something like that
[10:23] <chuckyp> harm_, well if you lspci you can find out but I would just make sure glxinfo | grep render   returns rendering support.  After that you should be fine with ut
[10:23] <crohaxx> cntb, already tried
[10:24] <livingdaylight> blimey: also check Add/Remove Programs has gmail notifier
[10:24] <jokoon> Are there better drivers for a sound card like sound blaster than the default ones ?
[10:24] <harm_> can i paste three lines?
[10:24] <cntb> someone here nust nknow howto rebuild windows manager starting
[10:24] <chuckyp> harm_, yeah
[10:24] <cntb>  s/nust/must
[10:24] <chuckyp> harm_, three lines should be fine
[10:25] <harm_> libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
[10:25] <harm_> direct rendering: Yes
[10:25] <harm_> OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) 915GM 20050225
[10:25] <chuckyp> cntb, what are you talking about now?
[10:25] <chuckyp> harm_, you should be fine you could try the i915 drivers
[10:25] <MasseR> !pastebin
[10:25] <harm_> sounds like to much hassle :)
[10:26] <sonics> well this may sound strange a bit, but anyone here playing @partypoker?
[10:26] <chuckyp> sonics, nope
[10:26] <MikeDK> MasseR it was only three lines man ease off:)
[10:26] <cntb> chuckyp: modem-fax
[10:26] <sonics> I wonder on howto use windows applications
[10:26] <jokoon> Is there a way to config my sound card to boost up treble and basse ?
[10:26] <cntb> why asking ? have some answer
[10:26] <harm_> sonics u can use wine
[10:26] <jordan> I need to go, if amir comes back would someone mention #kubuntu to him ?
[10:27] <chuckyp> sonics, wine nameof.exe
[10:27] <sonics> can wine do anything? can u install .exe files with it?
[10:27] <MasseR> MikeDK: No, for me :P
[10:27] <MikeDK> jordan rgr that
[10:27] <jokoon> thanks for help !
[10:27] <chuckyp> sonics, yes
[10:27] <n1gke> Good morning folks..
[10:27] <chuckyp> sonics, but it doens't quite run everything.
[10:27] <MikeDK> MasseR oooh ok :)
[10:27] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: /usr/lib/firefox/pluging/    vlc plugin is there along with the others its getting it to point to that in particular? How do i actually get firefox to choose vlc?
[10:27] <jordan> MikeDK: ty
[10:27] <harm_> n1gke and a good evening to u
[10:27] <blimey> ok chaps, many thanks
[10:28] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, Try moving the other ones just temporarily.  sudo mv /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/whatever*  /tmp/
[10:28] <marshall> hey guys
[10:28] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, as far as it choosing the proper one no idea
[10:29] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, but if the other ones aren't there it will have to use vlc
[10:29] <marshall> i have a couple of webcam videos that id like to edit, can anybody suggest a video editor to use for that?
[10:29] <chuckyp> marshall, cinerella
[10:30] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: nah... there has to be a more natural way of doing things
[10:30] <marshall> chuckyp, youve used it?
[10:30] <defrysk> remove the libtotemplugins
[10:30] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: if VLC is so great how come you use Mplayer anyways?
[10:30] <defrysk> or rename them
[10:30] <chuckyp> marshall, no i've just heard other people using it.  http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3
[10:30] <marshall> ok, thanks chuckyp
[10:30] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, I dunno just never tried it on edgy yet.  Had mplayer working so i've been using that.
[10:30] <pan2> hi
[10:31] <pan2> looking for some help: tried installing ubuntu this evening on my SATA drive and I get GRUB Error 22
[10:31] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, kind of if it works why fix it type of thing.
[10:32] <chuckyp> pan2, is this a dual boot setup or standalone?
[10:32] <niksavel> hey all
[10:32] <pan2> dual boot with XP, sorry meant to add that
[10:32] <pan2> I have two IDE drives and GRUB was actually installed on the first of those, even though all the OSes are on the other SATA drive
[10:32] <Geoffrey2> would this command work in Ubuntu?   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
[10:33] <CarinArr> pan2, i've had that before..
[10:33] <livingdaylight> chuckyp: kinda but not for the link i gave you... and doig a whole mv to /temp pallava evertime so firefox picks up the player you want is just cumbersome... Common you Pengwyn!
[10:33] <sonics> chuckyp: wine wont run it :((
[10:33] <pan2> carinarr- do tell
[10:33] <chuckyp> livingdaylight, no I agree I was saying just to move them to see if it works.  If it does why is there a need for the other plugins?  If you only need the one.
[10:33] <chuckyp> sonics, what app?
[10:34] <CarinArr> pan2, i can't remember exactly when it happened. I remember having problems installing off one cd and just burning another one which worked fine, but don't know if that's what solved THAT problem;)
[10:34] <CarinArr> sorry i can't be more specific
[10:34] <Yancho> Anyone has installed a CS:S Server pls? and can give me a hint what to do after installing the files pls ?
[10:34] <sonics> chuckyp: its betfair poker...
[10:34] <Nickle0de0n> Hi, I keep getting error 17 or 22 when loading grub. Is it a problem with the harddisk? if so, do i need to reinstall MBR? and how?
[10:34] <sonics> chuckyp: I googled for it, but nuffing found
[10:35] <chuckyp> sonics, that is the name of the application betfair poker?
[10:35] <augnob> to any beijing users -- release party at 7pm today - http://www.ubuntu.com.cn/releaseparty
[10:35] <Nickle0de0n> Its like this every two to three weeks. using dapper.
[10:35] <pan2> well let me ask this, what exactly does "hd0" mean-- that's where GRUB was installed and that's not the drive withthe OS nor the drive I normally boot from, but I took it because it was the default and no other options were listed
=== mumbles-zzz is now known as mumbles
[10:36] <sonics> chuckyp: Betfair Poker.exe
[10:36] <sonics> in ""
[10:36] <chuckyp> sonics, What isn't working exactly?
[10:36] <defrysk> pan2, (hd0) means mbr of master disk
[10:36] <chuckyp> sonics, like are you getting an error?
[10:36] <sonics> sec I tell you
[10:36] <sonics> yeah
[10:36] <pan2>  defrysk- and which is the master disk?
[10:36] <defrysk> master hd not slabe
[10:36] <defrysk> slave
[10:36] <chuckyp> pan2, that means primary master
[10:36] <defrysk> yes
[10:36] <Nickle0de0n> defrysk: does it matter whether its primary or secondary?
[10:37] <defrysk> yes
[10:37] <sonics> cuijinli: An internal error has occured GC_ImageBuffer: Release failed
[10:37] <pan2> defrysk: ok, but in my case i'm running everything off of a SATA drive (which the ubuntu installer thinks is a SCSI drive, /sda)
[10:37] <sonics> fixme:ddraw:DIB_DirectDrawSurface_Blt Can't handle DDBLT_WAIT flag right now.
[10:37] <pan2> What should I enter instead of hd0 to have GRUB put on the MBR of that disk?
[10:37] <chuckyp>  sonics hrm... Yeah the place to check to see if an app works with wine is. http://appdb.winehq.org/  and do a search for the name of the app on the left.
[10:37] <defrysk> pan2, it gives an error off and on right ?
[10:37] <chuckyp> sonics, those are apps that people have tested and their results.
[10:37] <Nickle0de0n> pan2: i think grub cant tell the difference. it just sees it as a nother hd.
[10:38] <niksavel> here's my problem if anyone can help:  I recently did a clean install of ubuntu edgy - everything works great, BUT when I try to start it with no network connection ubuntu it loads for minutes...  up to 10 comparing to 5 secs with network connection
[10:38] <defrysk> pan2, as in not always
[10:38] <pan2> defrysk- no, the error is consistent.  i've never successfully booted, always error 22
[10:38] <chuckyp> sonics, or you could see if they would be able to help you get it going possibly forums or #winehq
[10:38] <niksavel> using gnome...
[10:38] <niksavel> and it hangs on gnome splash screen
[10:38] <defrysk> pan2, and you simply installed it in the mbr
[10:38] <chuckyp> niksavel, possibly sitting htere trying to get an ip
[10:39] <niksavel> yes, I thought about it...  but it never did those lags in dapper
[10:39] <Nickle0de0n> defrysk: i have this on and off problem. is it by any chance a bug?
[10:39] <niksavel> the network is set for a static IP
[10:39] <Nickle0de0n> giving off one grub error or another during boot. i have about 2 harddisks (ide) attached.
[10:39] <cuijinli> sonics, I don't know what your words means
[10:39] <pan2> defrysk: well, i just followed the ubuntu installer off of the live cd and clicked ok when it was time to install grub.  like i said, it put it on hd0 even though that's not the drive i normally use (i then changed the bios settings to boot off of that drive instead otherwise it wouldn't see grub at all)
[10:39] <chuckyp> niksavel, well if its static then cable or wifi connection shouldn't matter.
[10:39] <niksavel> it happens if I change locations (I.e. it's configured for my workplace IP and I start it at home)
[10:39] <jeff____> how do i scroll up in CLI/terminal (I've got xserver problems)
[10:39] <defrysk> Nickle0de0n, off and on usually means loose threads or something
[10:40] <sonics> chuckyp: isnt Vmware sth similar to wine?
[10:40] <nothlit> jeff__, shift + pageup
[10:40] <niksavel> so until I configure the network settings for home connection I have to stare at the splash screen for 10 minutes
[10:41] <chuckyp> sonics, No  vmware is virtualization software.
=== luisbg_zZzZZzZz is now known as luisbg
[10:41] <Nickle0de0n> and how does loose threads translate to english? as in hung processes?
[10:41] <jeff____> nothlit: thanks!
[10:41] <pan2> i think he means loose cables
[10:41] <chuckyp> sonics, you could run winxp or whatever inside of vmware then get yoru betfair poker fix on.

[03:04] <mooky> I want 2 use it 2  ?
[03:04] <mooky> you want to use bluetooth on your Power PC to connect to the modem on another PC ?
[03:04] <mooky> is that what your asking ?
[03:04] <scamboy> mooky: ok, i hav bluetooth which ubuntu can detect. but it cannot trace my pocket pc...
[03:05] <Yancho> anyone has any idea why the game servers i am setting up (css / et / cod2) are being shown fine on LAN, but none of my friends over the Internet can access them? Ports from the router NAT are open, infact SSH is being reached
[03:05] <mooky> jesus - can you please just talk and explain clearly
[03:05] <mooky> what do you mean trace your pocket PC
[03:05] <mooky> it can find it but not connect ?
[03:05] <mooky> it can't see it at all ?
[03:05] <mooky> have you setup blooth tooth on your PC ?
[03:05] <scamboy> mean i can trace but cannot connect..
[03:05] <scamboy> yup..
[03:06] <scamboy> gnome-bluetooth
[03:06] <mooky> so it can "see" the device - but not connect and maintain and connection with it
[03:06] <scamboy> yes..
[03:06] <mooky> when you try to connect does it attempt a handshake ?
[03:06] <scamboy> the pocket pc is windows..
[03:06] <scamboy> no..i use command in terminal..
[03:06] <mooky> scamboy how does that have anything to do with it ?
[03:06] <mooky> does it attempt a hand shake ?
[03:08] <scamboy> mooky: i follow the command on ubuntu.com....something sudo..... and the is no handshake...when it looks for bluetooth devices it shows my pocket pc with mac address, but when i try to connect/pair to it it fails..
[03:08] <mooky> scamboy any error ?
[03:09] <scamboy> mooky: ya, juz it say fail to connect..
[03:09] <mooky> oh dear
[03:10] <scamboy> mooky: you dont understand??
[03:10] <tryggvib> When reading e-mail in Evolution it always shows the end of a new message (so I must always begin by scrolling "all the way" up). Am I missing some strange "setting" where I can fix this, or this is a bug?
[03:10] <mooky> well your english/typing is very hard to read but I do understand the problem now
[03:11] <scamboy> hmn....i have an A+ in ENGLISH......:-P
[03:11] <mooky> then your teacher/school is stupid
[03:11] <mooky> peepul dont talk wiv rubish wurds 2 make vem selves hurd
[03:11] <mooky> it makes it impossible to understand what your saying
[03:12] <apokryphos> mooky: please stop
[03:12] <scamboy> mooky: hey that rude..
[03:12] <mooky> apokryphos understood
[03:12] <scamboy> thats very rude..
[03:12] <mooky> its very hard to help - when someone is not explaining details and using "slang" typing
[03:12] <scamboy> mooky: i dont need ur 'help"
[03:12] <mooky> ok, no problem then
[03:15] <mooky> don't ask
[03:15] <kling0n> bugger
[03:15] <XiXaQ> how does VPN affect bandwidth? Does it require alot more of it, or?
[03:15] <kling0n> im having strange kernel messages
[03:15] <kling0n> on efty eft
[03:15] <kling0n> edgy eft even
[03:15] <boink> XiXaQ: depends on what you're doing
[03:15] <kling0n> pdflush and khelper
[03:15] <Rico> mooky: *it's* very hard to help
[03:15] <XiXaQ> boink, VNC over VPN for instance.. Does it slow it down significantly?
[03:15] <boink> depending on your bandwidth, rdesktop could slow things down a bit
[03:15] <boink> what's your bandwidth?
[03:16] <boink> you have pptp and ipsec for VPNs as well. ipsec offers much more security but is more difficult to set up under linux
[03:16] <XiXaQ> boink, I'm actually thinking more in general.
[03:17] <boink> again, what's your bandwidth?
[03:19] <aixing> lo
[03:20] <aixing> anyone running Edgy on a laptop and find that it doesn't shutdown?
[05:53] (ian_/#ubuntu) i eman im using xfce no on a diff account
[05:53] (Hoagie/#ubuntu) nothlit: My BIOS goes through until it says "Boot from CD:", sits there for 30 seconds, then goes straight to windows selection. I didn't get a windows install CD with the computer, and I don't think I have any other live CDs
[05:53] (boson_/#ubuntu) JDStone: useradd
[05:53] (JDStone/#ubuntu) thanks boson_
[05:54] (boson_/#ubuntu) JDStone: Although i recommend using users-admin
[05:54] (penguin42/#ubuntu) segfault: Ah for me I tried the non-apt way first, found it had an error but it had already been reported and there was a package needed for it to work
[05:54] (JDStone/#ubuntu) boson_: what's that?
[05:54] (sungod_/#ubuntu) hi guys
[05:54] (boson_/#ubuntu) JDStone: has a nice GUI for user management
[05:54] (sungod_/#ubuntu) muhahahaha
[05:54] (segfault/#ubuntu) aixing, ive got a dell d820, great on linux, if i could just get suspend/hibernate to work again id be set, it may be related to the nvidia beta driver im using tho, so maybe my own fault :)
[05:54] <Zim> hello
[05:54] (JDStone/#ubuntu) boson_: it's a server
[05:54] <Xzyx987X> k, I think I borked my kubuntu install by trying to manually install the alsa sound drivers
[05:54] (JDStone/#ubuntu) no gui
[05:54] (CarlFK/#ubuntu) penguin42: modprobe raid1, dmesg shows "md: bitmap version 4.39" ran ./MAKEDEV, still no /dev/md0
[05:54] (nothlit/#ubuntu) Hoagie, some bios's need a keystroke before they will boot from an alternative source
[05:54] (boson_/#ubuntu) JDStone: Never mind then =)
[05:55] <Zim> is there a way how to make an install DVD of 6.10 ?
[05:55] (OoberMick/#ubuntu) penguin42: www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~michaelg/oobermick.xlsfonts
[05:55] (JDStone/#ubuntu) thanks though boson_
[05:55] (penguin42/#ubuntu) CarlFK: ./MAKEDEV md    in the /dev directory?
[05:55] (Hoagie/#ubuntu) nothlit: Ah, so I should just tap the spacebar or something?
[05:55] (nothlit/#ubuntu) Hoagie, that sounds like what is happening, since it was looking to boot from the cd, then waited for a significant period of time
[05:55] (penguin42/#ubuntu) OoberMick: Thanks
[05:55] <Xzyx987X> X server is crashing every time I try startx
[05:55] (aixing/#ubuntu) segfault: thanx.
[05:55] (OoberMick/#ubuntu) penguin42: np
[05:55] (nothlit/#ubuntu) Hoagie, yeah, try something
[05:55] <MetaMorfoziS> have anybody same problem like me, after boot, my x have nasty colors, (00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 945G/GZ Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)) but only after boot, if i restarts x it goes good. What is the problem? how can i solve it? possible it is a xorg configuration problem or hw bug? i don't think hw bug. But it's abrand new machine
[05:55] <Hoagie> nothlit: Thanks a bundle, you've been a great help :) I'll try that now.
[05:56] <Xzyx987X> say FATAL: Error running install command for nvidia
[05:56] <Zim> If I extract the install-iso and burn it to a DVD, will this work to install too?
[05:56] <segfault> penguin42, maybe u could tell axisys what pkg that is if u recall, personally i would just use the apt way and then anything that it says not fully installed install by hand using apt-get, fixed it all up for me
[05:56] <Xzyx987X> which is weird since I didn't ness with the graphics driver at all
[05:56] <Xzyx987X> help?
[05:56] <Hoagie> nothlit: Have a good 'un.
[05:56] <penguin42> OoberMick: Hmm you've got a bunch of urw and adobe fonts I haven't got - I'm guessing the adobe ones are closed?
[05:56] <FreddyE> hi there!
[05:56] <penguin42> segfault: Ditto
[05:56] <nothlit> Xzyx987X, why do you need to type in startx?
[05:56] <scythe128> zim, you shoudl be able to burn the iso straignt to dvd (the burn image or make disk from image options)
[05:57] <nothlit> Hoagie ty
[05:57] <FreddyE> hi @all
[05:57] <Xzyx987X> because it won't start by default anbymore :P
[05:57] <nothlit> Xzyx987X, you disabled it?
[05:57] <Xzyx987X> I'm botting to the comnmand linbe
[05:57] <OoberMick> penguin42: I don't remember doing anything special... but you never know
[05:57] <scythe128> anyone have a clue what could cause synaptic not to start?
[05:57] <Xzyx987X> no I didn't disable anything
[05:57] <Zim> scythe128 I try to burn from XP
[05:57] <Zim> I only have nero5
[05:57] <nothlit> scythe128, run synaptic from a terminal and look at the errors
[05:57] <Xzyx987X> all I tried to do was install the sound drivers
[05:57] <FreddyE> Im a ubuntu/linux noob and could use some help, please
[05:57] <soundray> scythe128: another package manager running
[05:57] <scythe128> thankx noth
[05:57] <penguin42> OoberMick: You a tex head?
[05:58] <penguin42> sorry, tek ?
[05:58] <Xzyx987X> the default ones sounded kinda crappy
[05:58] <OoberMick> penguin42: in the sense that I have tetex installed, yes
[05:58] <scythe128> zim, using nero, you should be able to burn an image to disk..., why are you trying to burn a dvd instead of a cd anyways?
[05:58] <Zim> I dont have any CDs, only dvds
[05:58] <nothlit> Xzyx987X, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is worth a try
[05:58] <penguin42> OoberMick: Now I don't - but I'm just trying to install the set of fonts from that which you seem to ahve
[05:59] <Xzyx987X> yea, why not...
[05:59] <Xzyx987X> brb
[05:59] <nothlit> Xzyx987X, you didn't install the nvidia drivers?
[05:59] <Xzyx987X> I did, but they were working before
[05:59] <scythe128> zim, ahh, it should be the same process.  nero is nice like that
[05:59] <nothlit> Xzyx987X, you should try reinstalling those then, doesn't hurt anything
[05:59] <Zim> nope, tells me that I need a cd
[06:00] <Xzyx987X> what package were they in agsin?
[06:00] <nothlit> sudo aptitude reinstall nvidia-glx
[06:00] <scythe128> hmmm, used to let me, but I used 6
[06:00] <scythe128> zim, extracting the iso will give you the files, but I dont think the cd would be bootable
[06:00] <FreddyE> nobody here who would be willing to help a poor ubuntu noob? :-(
[06:01] <apokryphos> !helpme
[06:01] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:01] <FreddyE> oh,okay...lol
[06:02] <johns^> everybody waiting breathlessly on FreddyE's problem?
[06:02] <johns^> ;)
[06:02] <Juan> i have multiple users. when restoring a session, i get prompted for password twice, in the login screen and then the lock screen. is there a way to disable the lock screen and just use the login screen to restore session?
[06:02] <nothlit> Zim, http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/release/dvd/
[06:02] <FreddyE> well, my internet is behaving strange with ubuntu. my powerline is conected to a pc running xp (no drivers for the powerline adapter for ubuntu), the ubuntu pc is connected via network. internet works, but online some webistes
[06:03] <nothlit> Zim, daily build d/l here http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/dvd/current/
[06:03] <scythe128> no errors on synaptic from command line, wont start from menu (lol)
[06:03] <FreddyE> most websites dont show up on BOTH pcs as soon as the ubuntu pc is running. if I shut it down then all websites work again on the xp pc. So...Im really puzzeled
[06:03] <Zim> thx
[06:03] <rimad> guys, i tried installing ubuntu, using desktop cd version. It starts up very slow and when i click on "Install" icon on desktop, it starts reading CD and then it just freezes.
[06:03] <rimad> this is on laptop.
[06:03] <nothlit> scythe128, so it runs from the terminal?
[06:03] <OoberMick> penguin42: you might have already worked this out but the fonts are from tetex-extra. presumable you can just download the package and extract it somewhere and copy the files that you want
[06:04] <johns^> rimad: use the alternate install cd
[06:04] <penguin42> OoberMick: I just apt-got it
[06:04] <rimad> alternate?
[06:04] <johns^> yeah
[06:04] <rimad> where do i find that.
[06:04] <OoberMick> penguin42: all of latex just for the fonts?
[06:04] <soundray> FreddyE: sounds like a problem with the Windows connection sharing thingy to me.
[06:04] <rimad> and what could be wrong with this cd version?
[06:04] <nothlit> rimad, its just a little lower down on the install links
[06:04] <johns^> rimad: I guess the same place where you fount the desktop cd
[06:04] <iam8up|lpy> why does X start on run level 2?
[06:05] <rimad> whats the difference betwen alternate and regular one?
[06:05] <soundray> !alternate | rimad
[06:05] <ubotu> rimad: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[06:05] <nothlit> rimad, the livecd has a more sophisticated display driver and allows you to run other programs, there are more things that can go wrong
[06:05] <scythe128> well, off to try kernel 2.4.27-2-686
[06:05] <johns^> the Live cd is picky on some systems
[06:05] <iam8up|lpy> is there a runlevel that is multiuser and does not have a gui?
[06:05] <rimad> okay i got it, i will try this.
[06:05] <penguin42> OoberMick: I've put tetex-fonts-recommended in and am just doing tetex-extra-fonts
[06:06] <penguin42> OoberMick: I don't know if I'll have to restart X
[06:06] <FreddyE> soundray: its as if accass to most webpages is blocked as soon as the ubuntu pc runs...do you think installing a real webproxy on the xp machine could solve the problem?
[06:06] <nothlit> iam8up|lpy, why don't you just modify the runlevel?
[06:06] <johns^> I'm gone. Reboot
[06:06] <omem> The alternate CD is also supposed to be used for older machines... but how?
[06:06] <iam8up|lpy> nothlit - the default is run level 2, and that starts up the GUI...run level 1 would be single user, and i want multiuser
[06:06] <rausb0> iam8up|lpy: just remove the S??gdm or S??kdm symlink from the corresponding runlevel dir   (/etc/rcN.d, where N is the runlevel)
[06:06] <iam8up|lpy> nothlit - or are you asking to modify run level 2 itself?
[06:07] <iam8up|lpy> oh ok, and will that drop X as well?
[06:07] <soundray> FreddyE: honestly, I couldn't say. Is the powerline modem a USB one?
[06:07] <rausb0> iam8up|lpy: X is started by gdm/kdm
[06:07] <FreddyE> yes, usb one
[06:07] <iam8up|lpy> rausb0 - gotcha, tyvm
=== pingar is now known as ingar
[06:07] <Xzyx987X> x server reconfigured, nvidia drivers reinstalled, still getiing the same error :(
[06:08] <penguin42> hmm - other than restarting X is there a way to pick up new fonts that you have just installed?
[06:08] <Xzyx987X> I think the module settings are messed up
[06:08] <nothlit> iam8up|lpy, oh runlevel 2 is default on ubuntu systems? sorry haven't looked at runlevels since i installed this distro
[06:08] <iam8up|lpy> nothlit - yep, first line in inittab
[06:08] <Xzyx987X> the driver installation for the audio driver failed because of some module related reason
[06:08] <scamboy> any bluetooth expert here???
[06:09] <nothlit> iam8up|lpy, that doesn't make sense, if default is runlevel 2 it doesn't allow for any gradations
[06:09] <rausb0> iam8up|lpy: then better modify /etc/rc3.d and boot to that runlevel instead
[06:09] <Legendre_> hi, quick question.. is it possible to install ubuntu to a disk which is previously partitioned & holding data?
[06:09] <iam8up|lpy> nothlit - i thought the same thing =/
[06:09] <scythe128> wow, am I an idiot, I just tried boot to a 2.4 kernel
[06:09] <scythe128> legendre yes it is
[06:09] <scamboy> le: need to format...
[06:09] <soundray> Legendre_: yes
[06:10] <Legendre_> scythe128, soundray - how do I do this?
[06:10] <Hoagie> nothlit: Sorry to keep asking you, but, I tried pressing a key, with no luck...
[06:10] <soundray> Legendre_: the installer will offer you to resize, delete or reformat existing partitions
[06:10] <iam8up|lpy> Legendre_ - IIRC ubuntu's installer will just overwrite any files it must, but it will leave anything on there it doesn't care about (note that it will ask you to format near the end of the installer, do NOT do that if you want the data to be left there)
[06:10] <Legendre_> I see the option to 'manually edit partition table', but that's it
[06:11] <rausb0> in debian and debian based systems, runlevels 2 - 5 have no special meaning. they're all configured the same by default.
[06:11] <iam8up|lpy> Legendre_ - if the partitions are setup, go to the next screen
[06:11] <scamboy> legendre..choose keep current data...
[06:11] <scythe128> keeping the data requires that you install on a sererate partition, you have the option to resize your partitions during install (not 100% safe)
[06:11] <Ayabara> anyone here using truecrypt?
[06:11] <slinky_> Good day folks, can someone help me with installing a Binary Video Driver for an ATI Radeon 7200 card?
[06:11] <FreddyE> hmm...I think Im gonna try with a real proxy...so lets hope the best....thanks guys, and CU
[06:11] <iam8up|lpy> ubotu ati
[06:11] <EagleSW> hello guys I have a question how do I setup a ssh 22 connection to my server?
[06:11] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:12] <ProN00b> how do i enable framebuffer ? (and no, it is not enabled by default, at least not if you have nvidia-glx)
[06:12] <Legendre_> ok.. so, I can also configure it to use my existing layout? I have / boot var usr home on their own parts..
[06:12] <iam8up|lpy> slinky_ - there ya go
[06:12] <EagleSW> or how do I rehash the ssh 22 conf file ?
[06:12] <iam8up|lpy> EagleSW - /etc/init.d/sshd reload
[06:12] <nothlit> Hoagie, sorry then i wouldn't know, the only reason that xp would boot is if booting from the cd completely failed
[06:12] <Legendre_> the installer will allow me to tell it which to use for what?
[06:12] <EagleSW> I need it on kubuntu
[06:12] <EagleSW> it works ?
[06:12] <EagleSW> on kubuntu like this ?
[06:12] <nothlit> Hoagie, there isn't usually a wait of 30 seconds if you boot to xp is there?
[06:13] <Xzyx987X> the way linux handles drivers is somewhat convoluted imo, I think I actually prefer windows when it comes to setting up drivers...
[06:13] <Hoagie> nothlit: Nope, it normally skips right past the CD part. With the live CD in, it sits there spinning for a bit, then goes to xP
[06:13] <EagleSW> iam8up|lpy that command works on kubuntu ? command-line ?
[06:13] <soundray> Legendre_: yes. more specifically, when you use the partitioning tool, you will be able to set which partition will be mounted where.
[06:13] <iam8up|lpy> EagleSW - correct, i believe you'll need to use sudo as well
[06:13] <EagleSW> okay thanks
[06:13] <scythe128> what is the newest kernel image ?
[06:14] <Ropechoborra> !webcam
[06:14] <ubotu> webcam is now easy to install on Linux; instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[06:14] <Legendre_> soundray - ok.. and last Q: can this be done from the gui installer, or do I need to use CLI install?
[06:14] <tec> is there a file where xubuntu keeps its desktop settings like its resolution where i can edit it
[06:14] <Xzyx987X> windows is a lot less likely to completely blow up when youi mess up it's configuration too...
[06:14] <soundray> Legendre_: either will work
[06:14] <Legendre_> soundray nods, thanks much..
[06:14] <iam8up|lpy> sweet! i'm going to install my webcam on my z61m thinkpad and make prawn!!! w00t
[06:14] <Legendre_> will report back later ;-)
[06:14] <Hoagie> nothlit: It also skips past it with a non-bootable CD in there
[06:14] <nothlit> EagleSW, on the server sudo aptitude install openssh-server  | sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start  On client ssh user@192.168.0.xxx
[06:14] <FurryNemesis> tec, xorg.conf
[06:15] <soundray> Xzyx987X: ask yourself whether this discussion is on-topic in a ubuntu support channel
[06:15] <nothlit> Hoagie, have you tried updating your bios firmware?
[06:15] <EagleSW> okay thanks.. I've installed..
[06:15] <EagleSW> the ssh..
[06:15] <tec> even the xfce setting are there? because im suign gnome now on the same account....gnome is good but xfce is not the screen is runnign around because i changed the resolution and now i cant make it normal
[06:16] <nothlit> then type ssh <ip address of server here> ... then input the username and password when asked
[06:16] <iam8up|lpy> tec - iirc xfce still uses X windows - for that configuration it's in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:16] <nothlit> EagleSW, you should change the ssh port number if its exposed to the internet however, there are guides for more advanced stuff on ssh at help.ubuntu.com/community
[06:17] <Juan> i have multiple users. when restoring a session, i get prompted for password twice, in the login screen and then the lock screen. is there a way to disable the lock screen and just use the login screen to restore session?
[06:17] <slinky_> should the entry for Section "Device" Identifier be "Radeon 7200" or "ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R100 QD [Radeon 720] "  ????????????
[06:17] <Hoagie> nothlit: Uhh. *Looks baffled* I'm not that advanced... And I don't wanna go through that much trouble, as I wouldn't actually be installing ubuntu on this machine anyway ;)
[06:17] <h36sa_> slinky_: doesn't matter
[06:17] <StephenL> nothlit: it won't ask for a username if you do ssh ip....you have to do ssh user@ip or ssh -l user ip

[06:18] <slinky_> what PCI address should it be on?
[06:18] <andy101> help, ekiga softphone won't work, when I call echo test (sip:500@ekiga.net) I get abnormal call termination, my microphone and speakers seem to work when tested in the configuration dialog, any ideas how to find out what it means by 'abnormal call termination'?

[06:21] <CarlFK> penguin42: in /dev sudo ./MAKEDEV md - now I have /dev/.static/dev/md0 - but mount -t ext3 doesn;t see an ext3 fs.  so plan B: image one of the partitions: dd if=/dev/hdc6 of=hdc6.img - think I can get mdadm to make a /dev/md1 out of that?  like mounting a cd image with loop?
[06:22] <Ayabara> when I try to mount a truecrypt drive I get "FATAL: Module truecrypt not found.
[06:22] <Ayabara> truecrypt: Failed to load TrueCrypt kernel module". I'm new to linux, so I have no idea how to attack this...
[06:22] <SpudDogg> Does anyone know why on my Edgy server box I get 'Please insert disc labeled "Ubuntu-Server 6.10 _Edgy Eft_ - Release i386 (20061025.1)" then press Enter' instead of it just downloading the packages like the normal desktop version does?
[06:22] <slinky_> bsdfox: i am using integrated video at the moment but Radeon card is installed in maching but ignored by BIOS will that still work?
[06:23] <bsdfox> SpudDogg: you need to remove the cd line from /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:23] <CarlFK> SpudDogg: the CD is listed in your /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:23] <rellis> Whenever I attempt to browse smb:// paths in Nautilus or Konqueror on Ubntu 6.06 it throws an error about libsmbclient errors but not saying why it died. Any ideas?
[06:23] <bsdfox> slinky_: depends on what driver you are using ..either pull the radeon card or use it, make it easy on yourself
[06:23] <SpudDogg> bsdfox, CarlFK:  Thanks!
[06:24] <nothlit> Hoagie, well if you go into the bios menu it should tell you the number and the manufacturer hopefully. you go to your motherboard manufacturer's website and check the latest bios, and use their utilities to update it if necessary
[06:24] <guillem101> Is it safe to remove "dash" package? It promotes "ubuntu-minimal" and "initrd-tools" removal as well

[06:27] <gustavold> how to install java runtime environment plugin to firefox?
[06:27] <slinky_> bsdfox: Radeaon is 01:02.0   I can't pull integrated video only turn it off in BIOS, screen stays blank with Radeon 7200 card active after bootup screen

[06:28] <slinky_> bsdfox: i get error saying no device at 01:02.0 but xorg.conf file says 0:01.0
[06:28] <savvas> bittornado is better than rtorrent?
[06:28] <bsdfox> slinky_: are there two Device entries in your xorg.conf?
[06:28] <Hoagie> nothlit: I'd rather not try anything like that, is it's not actually my computer I'm testing the CD on. He gave me enough of a hairy eyeball when I described what the CD would (Or.. should...) do :P
[06:28] <slinky_> bsdfox:checking
[06:29] <guillem101> OK, found, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash"
[06:29] <guillem101> and disable dash as the default sh
[06:30] <guillem101> This dash thing has been causing some trouble in several places until I have realized... :,-(
[06:31] <slinky_> bsdfox: no only one entry, either integrated intel or radeon depending on which one i have activated and installed at any time
[06:31] <bsdfox> you should be able to remove the BusID line then
[06:31] <nothlit> Hoagie, loool i see
[06:32] <OoberMick> guillem101: if it is from ubuntu packages you should report bugs against them for using bash-ism in a /bin/sh script
[06:32] <nothlit> Hoagie, so why did you bring an armada of livecds to use?
[06:32] <savvas> Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root?
[06:32] <savvas> : Operation not permitted
[06:32] <savvas> what does this mean?
[06:32] <savvas> found it in the gnome baker log, but the writing goes ok
[06:32] <ZirJoker> what p2p software is the best???
[06:33] <guillem101> OoberMick, I'm not sure they are bugs... or "features" from bash I was somewhat relying on
[06:33] <Hoagie> nothlit: Well, I ordered lots, because... They were free... I tried the one, and when that failed, I got reinforcements >_>
[06:33] <guillem101> OoberMick, I only know that I *need* bash
[06:33] <slinky_> bsdfox: can i do that with gedit from bootup terminal cause i get blank screen after bootup when using Radeon, also how do i restart GDM from the terminal? without having to reboot
[06:33] <samu2> Hey I'm still having trouble running edgy on my PC. I can't even get the live desktop CD to run correctly. A few seconds after the default ubuntu user autologins the screen goes black for a second and then I get the login screen again. I've had ubuntu running successfully from 5.04 to 6.06.
[06:33] <bsdfox> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[06:34] <OoberMick> guillem101: if you are writing scripts that need bash then you should use #!/bin/bash not #!/bin/sh
[06:34] <guillem101> OoberMick, I've had two problems: one is the PATH environment variable not correctly set when launching sh scripts and the other a very specific detail using a C and popen
[06:34] <bsdfox> slinky_: edit the xorg.conf, remove the busid line, then run that /etc/init.d/gdm restart line
[06:34] <guillem101> OoberMick, sure, but popen() uses sh and you cannot say it to use bash
[06:35] <Yurtle> can somone give me ahand ive got ubuntu on a dell c400 laptop every once in a while when booting , it stops at hald for like 5 minutes, then it boots and gnome says couldnt initialize hal. but othertimes it boots just fine.....
[06:35] <nothlit> Hoagie, just remember that those cds are needed to help other people that wouldn't otherwise have access to foss get it
[06:36] <slinky_> bsdfox: i need to rename existing xorg.conf file and rename an older one with Radeaon in it and swap video cable and reset BIOS to get access to Readeon hardware, i then can issue the restart from terminal mode, yes?
[06:36] <guillem101> OoberMick, so I can see my script should have been #!/bin/bash, so I'm perhaps wrong complaining about dash... but for the popen() thing ... I don't really know if what I expect be OK at all, but it works with bash
[06:37] <Hoagie> nothlit: Yeah, I know. Loads of my friends are interested, but not sure about it. Was planning on passing them around
[06:37] <guillem101> OoberMick, for these reasons I don't want to fill a bug... but I'm not happy with dash either :-P
[06:37] <nothlit> Hoagie, ahh ok :)
[06:38] <OoberMick> guillem101: I'm not sure what you are trying to do but it sounds like you are happy with your fix. Just realise that you might use a system where /bin/sh isn't bash in the future and it might break again
[06:38] <Hoagie> nothlit: Sorry if it seems like I've been wasting your time :) I really appreciate the help, I just don't wanna risk blowing this PC to smithereens >_>
[06:38] <guillem101> OoberMick, you are right
[06:38] <guillem101> OoberMick, unless dash is broken, of course :-P
[06:38] <nothlit> Hoagie, lol no not wasting anyones time
[06:39] <chutwig> has anyone happened to run into any unusual behaviour with mysql-5.0.24 on edgy on amd64?
[06:39] <OoberMick> guillem101: and if it is you should report a bug :D
[06:39] <nothlit> Hoagie, thats the purpose of this channel lol, to help
[06:39] <slinky_> bsdfox: what program can i use to edit xorg.conf file from the boorup terminal to remove the line
[06:39] <bsdfox> nano
[06:39] <nothlit> Hoagie, you can always ask on ##linux
[06:39] <Arcad3> slinky
[06:39] <chutwig> the daemon's been crashing constantly and if i create any databases or do pretty much anything mysql won't even start again until i remove the files from /var/lib/mysql
[06:40] <chutwig> is most unusual
[06:40] <slinky_> Arcad# yes?
[06:40] <Arcad3> use pico or vi
[06:40] <Arcad3> np
[06:40] <jcooke> anyone have any experiences with setting up either bluetooth modem to a cingular EDGE enabled phone, or using the cingular PCMCIA card to connect?
[06:41] <slinky_> thanks for the help, getting out my hammer and having a go at this :)
[06:41] <Arcad3> :)
[06:41] <weau> hi
[06:41] <bkjones> quick question: does the ubuntu-supplied postgres not come with a way for the default administrative user to log in so he can create other users? I can't seem to do 'psql -U postgres'. Have I missed a trick? Sorry for my ignorance, but I normally build from source and don't have this issue.
[06:41] <guillem101> OoberMick, If checked that the problem with my script was my fault, since I had the PATH defined at .bashrc but not at .profile (where I guess sh may check by default) so this is one point for dash :-P
[06:42] <guillem101> OoberMick, but the problem is that I'm completely unsure about the popen thing. I may write a bug file to see if it gets honored or discarded
[06:43] <delou> hi, there! how do i watch rmvb files with ubuntu64?
[06:43] <OoberMick> guillem101: I wouldn't know about the popen thing. Can you copy the line from the C code here and see if anyone cares to comment
[06:43] <iam8up|lpy> if i do an apt-get install <package> and it says: Package sendmail is not available, but is referred to by another package. - how do i see what it was referred by?
[06:44] <bkjones> *sigh* nevermind. I just changed the auth method from the completely non-existent default to "trust" for the purpose of setting up the server.
[06:44] <bkjones> I'm pretty sure that makes like zero sense though.
[06:44] <Yurtle> can somone give me ahand ive got ubuntu on a dell c400 laptop every once in a while when booting , it stops at hald for like 5 minutes, then it boots and gnome says couldnt initialize hal. but othertimes it boots just fine.....
[06:45] <soundray> bkjones: no expert here, but have you checked the ubuntu help pages re. postgresql?
[06:45] <scythe128> anyone had any luck getting the internal memorystik on a sony vaio to work, ever?
[06:45] <bkjones> I didn't know there were any.
[06:46] <guillem101> OK, here it goes: popen( "cat - | xmgr -pipe & ); works when bash is sh but not when dash is; in bash, xmgr is left in background after pclose(). In dash, xmgr does not reach the data and the calling program sometimes gets closed and sometimes not

[06:47] <librano> hi all!
[06:47] <johso> hi, I'm having problems with my ATi Mobility Radeon 9700 Pro card. I only get around 125fps, and before I was able to get around 2200
[06:47] <Thib_G> but gentoo's gcc target is i686, and ubuntu's i486
[06:47] <bkjones> soundray: it was the damn sudo crap again :-/  Thanks for the pointer.
[06:47] <iam8up|lpy> johso - 2200 fps in what exactly?
[06:47] <bkjones> I really wish ubuntu would stop shoving that down my throat.
[06:47] <tengil> how do i reconfigure x when putting in a new graphics card?
[06:47] <iam8up|lpy> bkjones - sudo -i
[06:47] <johso> iam8up|lpy: sorry, pushed return by accident - glxgears
[06:48] <bkjones> iam8up|lpy: yeah, I know.
[06:48] <apokryphos> tengil: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[06:48] <soundray> bkjones: no need to be impolite. There are good reasons for the sudo thing
[06:48] <tengil> thanks
[06:48] <bkjones> impolite?
[06:48] <bkjones> it's a wish. I'm allowed to wish.
[06:48] <Arcad3> yeah
[06:48] <soundray> bkjones: yes, impolite
[06:48] <iam8up|lpy> soundray - to cause people to strangle themselves in aggravation, we know

[06:49] <bkjones> I can see using sudo for desktop users. For production administrators, it should be something they choose to set up. I'd rather not be treated as if I don't know better by default.
[06:50] <MarcN> bkjones: live on the edge and do sudo -i
[06:50] <iam8up|lpy> baastrup - ya, but you can't ask here

[06:54] <rarcke> HI, total noob with annoying Amarok problem.
[06:55] <johso> rarcke: what
[06:55] <johso> s
[06:55] <johso> ra
[06:55] <johso> darn
[06:55] <johso> rarcke: what's the problem?
[06:55] <rarcke> I installed Xine, and double checked it but Amarok still just skips right through my files.
[06:55] <iam8up|lpy> if i do an apt-get install <package> and it says: Package sendmail is not available, but is referred to by another package. - how do i see what it was referred by?
[06:56] <johso> rarcke: libxine?
[06:56] <rarcke> Yes
[06:56] <librano> or... using gedit on a .txt file how can i replace the spaces with linebreaks (new line)?
[06:56] <johso> rarcke: you probably need libxine-extracodecs
[06:57] <rarcke> I think I have that.
[06:57] <rarcke> let me tripple check
[06:57] <mathojojo> bonjour
[06:57] <Lathiat> librano: hrm not sure but you could pipe the file through sed, cat file.txt | sed 's/ /\n/g' > file2.txt
[06:57] <johso> rarcke: just regular mp3's you're trying to play?
[06:57] <Lathiat> librano: warning, dont cat file.txt > file.txt (use the same file for input and output) - that breaks things
[06:57] <mathojojo> est ce que quelqu'un sait commet faire fonctionner une tablette graphique WACOM volito2 sur edgy ?
[06:57] <rarcke> Yes, I have extracodecs
[06:58] <rarcke> and yes, just regular mp3s

[06:58] <Arcad3> install xmms
[06:58] <iam8up|lpy> mathojojo - non, l'anglais

[06:59] <tunnelrat> hey new here... trying to resolve an issue with a wandering mouse on a Dell Inspiron 8000.  any one have a fix?
[06:59] <aoupi> hi, can I mount a disk in 2 places at the same time? (chrooting issues :)
[06:59] <mathojojo> did someone tried to use a WACOM volito2 graphic tablet on EDGY ?
[06:59] <Gwildor> tunnelrat, that is a hardware problem.....atleast with my experience
[07:00] <tunnelrat> yeah I am trying to figure out a way to disable the stick pointer, that fixes the issue when I use the windows side of the laptop.   but I haven't figured out a fix on the linux side
[07:00] <Arcad3> i.ve notice a lot of probs on edgy
[07:00] <librano> worked like a charm.... thanks!!!!
[07:00] <Arcad3> i'm happy with dapper as it is
[07:01] <v-dogg> hey guys
[07:01] <FurryNemesis> Arcad3, I feel the same. No dist-upgrade until I've got all my work done
[07:01] <aoupi> I'd like to mount disk {insert long UUID} both in /path/one and in /another/path is that possible, I can't symlink since that'll make it unaccessible when chrooted into /another/path
[07:01] <FurryNemesis> hi v-dogg
[07:02] <Arcad3> after that it will ruin ur work
[07:02] <Arcad3> i will never upgrade

[07:03] <rhican> try*
[07:03] <v-dogg> Arcad3: openoffice is not an editor and definetely not suitable for code editing :)
[07:03] <johso> rarcke: which reason? did you try "sudo apt-get install -f"?
[07:03] <Shish> v-dogg: vim
[07:03] <nexu_> thanks ^
[07:04] <Arcad3> use notepad++ :P
[07:04] <v-dogg> Shish: vim with a GUI?
[07:04] <Arcad3> then

[07:12] <Douglish> Or .. I have problem with installing ubuntu. I enter manual partitioning, create partitions and then porceed, and I have to assign mount points. But the list on the right side with partitions is empty, but they were created. It's in kubuntu 6.06 LST .. Where should be a problem?
[07:12] <rodrigo> ?

[07:14] <TheoMurpse> Has there been one for any previous release? I sure wouldn't know, as I don't use IRC on a regular basis.
[07:14] <TheoMurpse> And the topic of this chan doesn't say anything to the contrary.
[07:14] <XVampireX> Or maybe nevermind
[07:14] <holy_cow> The error is error while loading shared libs: libdbus-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or dir

[07:18] <Douglish> Arcad3: or tar.bz2 tar xjfv; cd source; ./configure; make; make install under root ..
[07:18] <rhican> Douglish, the partitions should be there i guess, can you double check with fdisk?
[07:19] <Douglish> but after partitioning an dialog with new device appears .. I'll check the fdisk ..
[07:20] <RememberPOL> Hmm, ever since upgrading to Ubuntu 6.10... tremulous has been really dark even at full brightness.... any ideas?

[07:28] <phaedra> ZirJoker, If wine doesn't install an icon to the desktop, you'll have to start them from the directory or creat a link yourself.
[07:28] <yrlnry> You can go into it just like any other directory.

[08:10] <beagleisevil> sgorilla80, yes
[08:11] <soundray> !fuse | sgorilla80
[08:11] <ubotu> sgorilla80: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:11] <sgorilla80> thanks
[08:11] <beagleisevil> sgorilla80, but it's dicey
[08:11] <sgorilla80> yeah i assume so
[08:11] <sgorilla80> is the captive-ntfs project dead?
[08:12] <NET||abuse> is there a wine deb for edgy, not just dapper as the site seems to say only dapper and breezy
[08:12] <NET||abuse> ?
[08:12] <soundray> sgorilla80: you have a better chance of getting an answer in #knoppix
[08:12] <netdownload> ok
[08:12] <NET||abuse> or can i just use the edapper version on edgy?
[08:12] <sexcopter8000> is there a way to import an svg file into a document in openoffice writer?
[08:13] <soundray> sexcopter8000: yes, with an addon
[08:13] <netdownload> soundray: there is a way to reboot modprobe without rebooting the machine?
[08:13] <gustavold> did anyone here installed firefox java plugin on amd64 ?
[08:13] <gustavold> I've read a lot about. But it didnt work
[08:13] <NET||abuse> sorry, just found the first edgy release of wine
[08:13] <sexcopter8000> soundray: ok, do you know the name of it? Is it in a repository somewhere?
[08:13] <soundray> sexcopter8000: http://www.ipd.uka.de/~hauma/svg-import/ -- I find it works really well. You have to install it for each user.
[08:14] <sexcopter8000> ok, thanks soundray
[08:14] <soundray> netdownload: just do a 'rmmod pcspkr' and you should be fine. If that doesn't remove it, it'll be best to reboot.
[08:14] <NET||abuse> hjahahahaha,, nyuts... i'm on amd64,,, ubuntu edgy is only i386... :(
[08:15] <kzm_> Hmm.. I have a vt1211.c -- how to I turn it into vt1211.ko?
[08:15] <soundray> sexcopter8000: note the limitation about gradients
[08:15] <jackrazz> hey everyone
[08:15] <soundray> kzm_: there should be a README or INSTALL file
[08:15] <jackrazz> Is it easy to create a link to a folder on my desktop
[08:15] <jackrazz> ?
[08:15] <kzm_> soundray, I agree - there should.  There isn't :-(
[08:16] <jackrazz> I don't happen to see how to do that
[08:16] <soundray> kzm_: normally it's './configure && make'
[08:16] <elriah> NET||abuse: Unless you're running some crazy floating-point or mega-ram intensive apps, the 64-bit editions have no human perceivable performance advantage...
[08:16] <kzm_> soundray, I *only* have the .c file...
[08:16] <jackrazz> alriah, how about servers..is 64bit any better there?
[08:17] <soundray> kzm_: have you looked at the contents?
[08:17] <kzm_> Perhaps I'll just download kernel-sources, and see how the rest are built...
[08:17] <elriah> Maybe a pure 64-bit database server that has terrabytes of data...
[08:17] <kzm_> I haven't looked in much detail, no.
[08:18] <jackrazz> ok, so for normal small business servers, stick to x86
[08:18] <elriah> beagle_hog: lol, how do you start networkmanager?
[08:18] <jackrazz> I tried swift fox the other day and didn't notice a perceptable difference
[08:18] <netdownload> soundray: but if I mod only the blacklist file without removing its module from the kernel it's the same?
[08:18] <elriah> jackrazz: Unless you just want the 'cool, I'm running 64-bit' factor, yes.
[08:19] <beagleisevil> elriah, networkmanager at the commandline
[08:19] <soundray> netdownload: the blacklist only affects the loading process. Once a module is loaded, blacklist has nothing to do with it.
[08:19] <jackrazz> I understand, I'm a newbie and didn't want the additional complications
[08:19] <elriah> hrm... no joy.. it installed some daemons... Maybe I missed something...
=== nonez is now known as anonez
[08:20] <beagleisevil> elriah, plse hold checking
[08:20] <netdownload> soundray but also if I reboot the module will be restarted (if I didn't delete)?
[08:20] <ashzilla> Hi. I updated my kernel and headers to 2.6.17-10-generic, and when I try to launch VMware the server does not start and I'm left with the following error: /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware: /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libpng12.so.0/libpng12.so.0: no version information available (required by /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2)
[08:20] <david_> can someone tell me how to reconfig my display
[08:20] <soundray> netdownload: not if you've added it to the blacklist
[08:20] <david_> wha tis the comamd for it
[08:20] <netdownload> soundray: ok
[08:21] <jackrazz> Is it possible to have an icon on my desktop linking to a folder on a different drive?
[08:21] <elriah> ashzilla: what do you get when you do a uname -r from the command line?
[08:21] <netdownload> so I have only to reboot
[08:21] <soundray> david_: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[08:21] <ashzilla> elriah: 2.6.17-10-generic
[08:21] <soundray> jackrazz: yes: ln -s /path/to/folder $HOME/Desktop/
[08:21] <netdownload> without cancel the module
[08:21] <ashzilla> Is it possible to have key bindings to copy/paste into the cli?
[08:21] <beagleisevil> elriah, works for me
[08:21] <beagleisevil> you have to run via sudo
[08:21] <jackrazz> ashzilla: are you trying to install the vmware tools or the server from within linux?
[08:22] <elriah> beagleisevil: hrm... brb, gonna try a few things
[08:22] <ashzilla> jackrazz: I have had vmware server installed in ubuntu since breezy, and when I updated to edgy, ran the new config script to update the files to accomodate the updated kernel, vmware would not launch
[08:22] <jackrazz> soundray: thanks
[08:22] <beagleisevil> elriah, I am using ndiswrapper, also had to edit /etc/networks  etc
[08:23] <jackrazz> oh, ok
[08:23] <{_-IcE-_}> can any1 tell me were squid outputs its logfiles by details pls? when i try start it, it just says ok but never actually starts
[08:23] <jackrazz> for what its worth automatix2 can install vmware server on edgy

[08:25] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:25] <Farm_Fresh> anyone else having problems with Egdy freezing up?
[08:25] <cryptonic> does anyone know how to mount a new partition made with gparted?
[08:26] <kzm_> Farm_Fresh, check the bug archives?  ISTR there were a few...
[08:26] <beagleisevil> Farm_Fresh, well I have degredation due to beagle is evil
[08:26] <Farm_Fresh> seems to be when running a web browser.
[08:26] <noxxle> how do i tell what init i am running in?
[08:26] <beagleisevil> Farm_Fresh, what is top showing at that point
[08:27] <Halpo> How can i change the system/theme font size?
[08:27] <beagleisevil> Farm_Fresh, run top then open browser and watch
[08:27] <david_> what is the comand to update or install a program
[08:27] <Farm_Fresh> beagleisevil:  What is top?
[08:27] <beagleisevil> Farm_Fresh, process monitor... open terminal and type top
[08:27] <beagleisevil> david_, apt-get install <program name>
[08:28] <NetVamp> Already, if you just want me to go ;) I'm messing around with Freenx on Dapper or at least Im trying. I downloaded the packages client, node and sever from the nomachine.com website and Installed them on dapper, as far as I can see installing went fine, but I somehow cant get it configured right. I got ssh running on port 444 and with a privat key added in authorized_keys2, that works, how do I have to configure Freenx now? I got a node.cfg an
[08:28] <david_> cool
[08:28] <beagleisevil> david_, and dont forget to use sudo
[08:28] <david_> ok
[08:28] <iam8up|lpy> if i do an apt-get install <package> and it says: Package sendmail is not available, but is referred to by another package. - how do i see what it was referred by?
[08:28] <KaLL3^^> is there anyone who could help me with samba and "network path not found"-error message? :O
[08:28] <david_> where can i find a list of comands for ubuntu
[08:28] <Farm_Fresh> beagleisevil:  So what exactly should I be looking for?  When it freezes, I can't do anything.. I have to do a hard reboot.
[08:28] <{_-IcE-_}> can any1 tell me were squid outputs its logfiles by details pls? when i try start it, it just says ok but never actually starts
[08:29] <noxxle> how do i tell what init i am running in?
[08:29] <beagleisevil> iam8up|lpy, did you edit your sources.list file
[08:29] <iam8up|lpy> beagleisevil - yes
[08:29] <beagleisevil> Farm_Fresh, hmmm that bad
[08:29] <NetVamp> I changed the Ports mentioned in node.cfg and server.cfg to 444 but I still cant connect. a sudo /usr/NX/bin/nxserver --status gives mit a connected to host 127.0.0.1 port 444 connection refused
[08:29] <beagleisevil> only when using a browser ?
[08:29] <NetVamp> so its not even running
[08:29] <Farm_Fresh> yeah.
[08:30] <beagleisevil> which browser Farm_Fresh
[08:30] <NetVamp> restart doesnt help, it still says connection refused. So I believe thats all I can say to that problem
[08:30] <Farm_Fresh> I mananged to do the 5hr update without incident... firefox, epifiney
[08:30] <Farm_Fresh> or however you spell that
[08:30] <beagleisevil> ok so its a deeper issue
[08:30] <beagleisevil> did you look for errors in /var/log/syslog
[08:30] <Farm_Fresh> no.
[08:30] <noxxle> gentoo is the fastest booting linux distro EVER
[08:30] <noxxle> less than half the time of ubuntu
[08:31] <Farm_Fresh> I'll look now.

[08:42] <savvas> RawSewage: in simple mode or detailed mode?
[08:42] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: what is ogg level 100 ?  if you mean ogg/vorbis, it accepts a value from -1.0 to 10.0

[08:44] <RawSewage> savvas, I went to Detailed to set the Ogg qualtiy, then went back to Simple
[08:44] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: you probably do not want to use 10.0 for the quality, though.  that will make very large files and you won't be able to tell the difference

[08:45] <Samus_Aran> so does anyone know how I can install something with apt-get when it tells me that some other app has an unmet dependancy ?  and how can I permanently get rid of the warning, when the package it wants is not needed and doesn't exist, heh
[08:46] <nothlit> Malachi, try sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
[08:46] <shiv> can anybody help. Whats wrong with this command? sudo chmod 700 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/*.*
[08:46] <Corbo> Samus: I'm having the same problem here
[08:46] <iwkse> shiv: *.*
[08:46] <virno> samus - you may have to add a repository
[08:46] <savvas> Samus_Aran: this fixes the dependencies: sudo apt-get install -f
[08:46] <Corbo> shiv, lose the *.* use -r instead
[08:46] <Malachi> I'll try it, nothlit. Thanks.
[08:46] <shiv> ok let me try
[08:46] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: if you want 128kbps then you can set that with the encoder, e.g. oggenc --bitrate=128
[08:47] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I dont want that specifically.  just in general, what ogg setting compares
[08:47] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: the "quality" setting will depend entirely on the input media for how large it is
[08:47] <Goomie> trying to install fluxbox on server install, any ideas?
[08:47] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: at very high bitrates, vorbis and mp3 are similar, at lower rates vorbis wins by far
[08:47] <Malachi> nothlit: Nope. I remember trying that and setting it to ubuntu-theme, and that's when I got the shutdown one, but the startup one still doesn't show.
[08:47] <teledyn> does anyone know why transferring files to a usbdrive is really slow?
[08:48] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, ok
[08:48] <Goomie> ap-get install fluxbox do i need to install anything else?
[08:48] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: e.g. 320kbps vorbis and mp3 will be almost identical.  whereas 96kbps mp3 sucks, 96kbps vorbis sounds just fine.  even 64kbps vorbis has good range (nice clear bass sounds), while mp3 is tinny

[08:50] <iam8up|lpy> !ubuntu

[08:50] <St_MPA3b> what dos emulator is better?
[08:50] <iam8up|lpy> dosbox!
[08:50] <dfgas> in edgy do we have write access to ntfs? or how is it achieved and how stable is it?
[08:50] <St_MPA3b> ok
[08:50] <shiv> Corbo: I get this error shiv@shiv-laptop:~$ sudo chmod 700 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts -r
[08:50] <shiv> Password:
[08:50] <shiv> chmod: cannot access `700': No such file or directory
[08:50] <POVaddct> dosbox is nice
[08:50] <iwkse> dfgas: you need ntfs-3g
[08:50] <Qmari> People please help, I did not find any usefull info about my problem, I have ATI Radeon X850XT PCIe card and ubuntu 6.10 install fails to start in normal mode and in safe graphics mode. Please tell me that I won't be able to install ubuntu on my system or tell me what to do
[08:51] <Corbo> ehaz: not found
[08:51] <virno> ntfs writing is not enabled by default in edgy
[08:51] <St_MPA3b> how to enable it?
[08:51] <St_MPA3b> !ntfs
[08:51] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[08:51] <Malachi> Thanks nothlit: I'll try it out (obviously I can't give you the results)
[08:51] <dfgas> iwkse, this is gonna be on a server
[08:51] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: the quality setting is the minimum allowable reduction in quality.  if the source has lots of noise (e.g. concert bootleg) it will be compressed less than a clean source (digital cd master).  the default quality setting for vorbis (3.0) is usually a bit better than a 128kbps vbr mp3
[08:51] <v-dogg> how safe is it to use ntfs write?
[08:51] <St_MPA3b> !fuse
[08:51] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:51] <St_MPA3b> safe
[08:51] <Corbo> st: do you have to keep it as ntfs or is changing the file system an option?
[08:51] <nothlit> Malachi, i hope it works
[08:51] <iwkse> dfgas: what?
[08:51] <dfgas> the ntfs drives
[08:51] <St_MPA3b> at least, i dont kno any1 who cracked it :)
[08:51] <virno> qmari - what does your screen look like?
[08:52] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: but unless you have an expensive sound system and very sharp ears, just encode a track at low medium and high qualities and see if you can tell the difference
[08:52] <Corbo> ntfs is fine read only
[08:52] <dfgas> iwkse, ahh i see now cool. thanks
[08:52] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I dont remember what the defaults were
[08:52] <iwkse> dfgas: you just need to install ntfs-3f and leave alone ntfs
[08:52] <St_MPA3b> !fuse
[08:52] <ehazlett> Corbo:  add the Universe repo
[08:52] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:52] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: I mean, "low is fine" and still better than mp3
[08:52] <v-dogg> St_MPA3b: really? I thought it was experimental and very unstable
[08:52] <iwkse> ntfs-3g..sorry
[08:52] <Qmari> virno: The scrollbar is at 90% and there is a green line. Keyboard is working
[08:52] <savvas> Samus_Aran: this ignores any packages not installed, it's man apt-get: sudo apt-get install -m package-name
[08:52] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, ok ty
[08:52] <St_MPA3b> <v-dogg> my forrum m8es told me, that it's ok
[08:52] <St_MPA3b> <v-dogg> forum*
[08:52] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, so 6 out of 10 is excellent?
[08:52] <iwkse> ntfs-3g isn't instable. works great
[08:52] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: is that app you mentioned a front-end to the official "oggenc" command line app, or does it use its own encoder ?
[08:53] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: 6 out of ten is very high quality
[08:53] <virno> qmari - is your display messed up? or is your system frozen?
[08:53] <Qmari> virno: my display is messed up
[08:53] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, soundKonverter is a frontend to various sound en- and decoding programs
[08:53] <jeff__> aside from w3m, what are other easy to use text browsers
[08:53] <jeff__> ?
[08:54] <Qmari> virno: it seems the installer tries to start X but fails
[08:54] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: you can also specify minimum and maximum bitrates to oggenc, for example: --min-bitrate=100 --max-bitrate=200
[08:54] <virno> try pressing f4 at the menu, and changing your display to 1024x768 with 24 bit color
[08:54] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, thats too confusing for me.  I know nothing about sound
[08:54] <MugginsM> jeff__: links   is a pretty good text browser
[08:54] <virno> qmari - and then use the safe mode option
=== Renan_s2 is now known as \o
[08:54] <DraconPern> on edgy, is ctrl-alt-1 suppose to give me tty1?
[08:54] <Qmari> ok thanks
[08:54] <Qmari> I will try and be back
=== \o is now known as Renan_s2
[08:54] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: then just set the quality to 3, see if your ripped CD sounds "perfect" to your ears, if it does, you're done.  if not, up it to 5
[08:55] <virno> qmari - i had a similar problem, good luck with a radeon card though
[08:55] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: I mean 30%
[08:55] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I'll go with 60%
[08:55] <DraconPern> some how I just get graphical garbage, this is on an ati x1300
[08:55] <nothlit> jeff elinks
[08:55] <Corbo> whats the Universe repo address?
[08:55] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: it also depends on how much hard drive space you have to burn
[08:56] <iwkse> anybody use canon printers?
[08:56] <shiv> can anybody help. Whats wrong with this command? sudo chmod 700 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/*.*
[08:56] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I have a DVD burner. unlimited space
[08:56] <iwkse> shiv: somebody already replied to you. don't spam
[08:56] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: honestly, with my medium quality sound system, I can't tell a difference between 90kbps vorbis and quality 10
[08:56] <shiv> iwkse: it did not work
[08:56] <St_MPA3b> !fuse
[08:56] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:56] <ehazlett> Corbo:  deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe
[08:56] <iwkse> shiv: man chmod
[08:56] <Corbo> thanks ehaz, you've been very helpful
[08:56] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: and both are better than an 128kbps mp3
[08:57] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I'll just convert he mp3 to ogg so the ogg is about the same filesize.  then Im sure I'll have good quality
[08:57] <jeff__>  cane someone please help me? I've upgraded from xubuntu dapper
[08:57] <jeff__>                to edgy (by editing sources.list and then running update,
[08:57] <jeff__>                dist-upgrade) but now xserver won't start. please help
[08:58] <ehazlett> Corbo: np
[08:58] <elriah> jeff__ Frankly, easiest thing to do is backup your data and reinstall...
[08:58] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: if you're converting, then I wouldn't worry about quality as much.  I mean, that is encoding it twice: cd -> mp3 -> vorbis.  so you will lose some quality.  the only reason I see to reencode is if you're trying to save hard drive space, in which case you should set it to around 70kbps vorbis
[08:58] <Homer_Linux> hiya ppl i upgraded to edgy and now when ever i start in gnome the panel wont load ,getting error "ive detected a panel already running,and will now exit" but in system monitor there no panel running and i get the same message if started from terminal
[08:59] <elriah> Homer: Did you reboot and try?
[08:59] <Samus_Aran> savvas: thank you, I will give that a try
[08:59] <savvas> jeff__: wait
[08:59] <jeff__> elriah: i don't have a place to backup too
[08:59] <nothlit> jeff__, have you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[08:59] <jeff__> to
[08:59] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, theyre podcasts.  I prefer ogg to mp3
[08:59] <Homer_Linux> elriah cant remeber will try the bbiab
[08:59] <elriah> Install a clean copy, seperate partition?
[09:00] <savvas> jeff__: login in the terminal and try this: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[09:00] <jeff__> nothlit: yes i have tried that, except "reconfigure" didn't work. Rather "configure" worked
[09:00] <Tampler> hi all
[09:01] <JosefK> !network-manager-gnome
[09:01] <ubotu> network-manager-gnome: network management framework (GNOME frontend). In component main, is optional. Version 0.6.3-2ubuntu6 (edgy), package size 245 kB, installed size 1608 kB
[09:01] <Samus_Aran> I tried both "apt-get install -m netpbm" and "apt-get -m install netpbm", but neither tried to install it, it just complained about the opera package not having its non-existant dependancy
[09:01] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I mean sound fx.  I have a folder of sound fx in tons of diff formats
[09:01] <JosefK> hmm, network-manager doesn't seem to be available on my system :/ (not on the install CD at least)
[09:01] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, I want to encode them all to ogg
[09:01] <anonez> Font Q: I've installed the Webcore fonts via a .rpm converted to a .deb (using alien). I can select the new fonts under System->Preferences->Font, but not under the font config in Firefox, nor can i see them under fonts:// in Nautilus. What could it be?
[09:01] <Corbo> jose - mine niether
[09:01] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, thats what Im doing
[09:01] <elriah> josefk: sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
[09:01] <jeff__> savvas: ok. trying that now
[09:02] <JosefK> elriah: thanks, however the problem is I'd need net to do that
[09:02] <elriah> Ahh!
[09:02] <elriah> oops
[09:02] <elriah> heh
[09:02] <JosefK> elriah: fortunately I have a working NIC and spare network cable, but other people might not be so lucky :/
[09:02] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: I encoded all my sound clips to Ogg/Vorbis recently, saved a bunch of space
[09:02] <jeff__> nothlit: before doing that command, when i log on, i get a screen that says my xserver is broken or not fully installed
[09:02] <Outerlimit> !ext3
[09:02] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[09:02] <samu2> It's kinda sad an upgrade to 6.10 made me have to reinstall 5.10...
[09:02] <savvas> jeff__: it should get the desktop up and running, but if it doesn't, do: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xubuntu-desktop
[09:02] <elriah> jeff__: run this command: sudo apt-get "windows-xp-stable"
[09:03] <elriah> lol, jk
[09:03] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: mostly WAV files, I mean.  a few other misc ones as well (mp3, au, etc.)
[09:03] <elriah> ;)
[09:03] <savvas> :P
[09:03] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, what settings did you use
[09:03] <jeff__> savvas: i'll take note of your second command, in case the 1st doesn't work
[09:03] <Samus_Aran> savvas: oops, that last line I said was for you: I tried both "apt-get install -m netpbm" and "apt-get -m install netpbm", but neither tried to install it, it just complained about the opera package not having its non-existant dependancy
=== avc_cook is now known as acuster
[09:04] <Samus_Aran> savvas: it got lost in the flood of chat in here, heh.
[09:04] <nothlit> jeff__, no, not dpkg --reconfigure... dpkg-reconfigure
[09:04] <jeff__> nothlit: ok. i'll try that after a curret command is done
[09:04] <Corbo> how do I use network manager
[09:04] <Corbo> how do I call it I mean
[09:04] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: oggenc -q 5 *.wav
[09:04] <Samus_Aran> RawSewage: I think
[09:04] <jeff__> i'm using CLI's irc client named "irc". how can i get the text size smaller?
[09:04] <RawSewage> Samus_Aran, ok
[09:05] <bag83> hi, did anyone know a user friendly tool to control my ADSL connection, a tool that my grandmother can understand?
[09:05] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: that is a function of the terminal, not the application
[09:05] <POVaddct> jeff__: that is not the setting of the irc program, but of the terminal itself.
[09:05] <savvas> Samus_Aran: remove the opera package, and install it again with automatix
[09:05] <Corbo> bag: lol
[09:05] <LjL> !automatix
[09:05] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[09:05] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: also, you might want to try out "irssi", it has the most features and ease-of-use of any console based IRC client (it's the one I have used for years now =)
[09:05] <POVaddct> jeff__: do you use a terminal emulator in X or the linux console?
[09:06] <Samus_Aran> savvas: I have never heard of automatix, will look it up
[09:06] <Corbo> what is the terminal command for network manager?
[09:06] <savvas> meh
[09:06] <POVaddct> jeff__: yeah, listen to Samus_Aran. irssi is *much* better that irc
[09:06] <pianoboy3333> is there a reason nautilus in edgy should be taking up 40-50% of my cpu?
[09:06] <bun-bun> bag83# what kind of control are you talking about?
[09:06] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: if it's indexing a folder with a lot of multimedia files, 'strace -p *process id*' for more info
[09:06] <savvas> Samus_Aran: look about the warning they all say in !automatix :P
[09:06] <Samus_Aran> savvas: just read that warning, heh
[09:07] <savvas> i just install what i want and remove the repos
[09:07] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: but... I don't even have beagle.... does nautilus index on its own?
[09:07] <bag83> bun-bun: create connection on a simple click, watch the online status, and kill the connection with one klick, as simple as possible ;-)
[09:07] <ashzilla> Hi. I updated my kernel and headers to 2.6.17-10-generic, and when I try to launch VMware the server does not  start and I'm left with the following error: /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware:   /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libpng12.so.0/libpng12.so.0: no version information available (required by   /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2)
[09:07] <Samus_Aran> now do they say it breaks the system because of the unmet dependancies, or because it actually does something else bad ?  I mean, I know how to manage my deps ... I used Slackware for years installing everything via source =p
[09:07] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: well, it has to render the previews, that can take up a bit of cPu
[09:07] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: the only part of nautilus open is the desktop... no windows or anything
[09:07] <oem_nnacht> hi everyone, how can I turn off the graphical boot of ubuntu 6.10?
[09:07] <savvas> jeff__: how's it going? :)
[09:08] <bun-bun> bag83# so you don't want to leave the connection on?  or is that not an option?
[09:08] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: *shrugs* strace -p *process id* to find out more
[09:08] <pianoboy3333> oem_nnacht: ummm I can help you with that
[09:08] <Samus_Aran> and in this case, Opera wants a package that doesn't exist anymore on 6.06, and I looked up the contents of it .. and it's just an empty placeholder package
[09:08] <LjL> oem_nnacht: remove "splash" in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:08] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: what would the process id be? nautilus?
[09:08] <pianoboy3333> LjL: yae
[09:08] <pianoboy3333> *yea
[09:08] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: yes
[09:08] <oem_nnacht> ok, thanks, I will try
[09:08] <strabes> pianoboy3333: i would also be interested in learning how to disable the graphical boot
[09:08] <r2d2_here> hi guys, have a strange problem i have gnome running, i want to run a GUI in this gnome session from apache(php) i know this sounds funny, but is it possible to specify in which session an app will start with backticks
[09:08] <Samus_Aran> strabes: edit your /etc/inittab file, set it to a different runlevel
[09:09] <bun-bun> strabes pianoboy3333 look into runlevels
[09:09] <pianoboy3333> strabes remove the splash in /boot/grub/menu.lst where it states what vars you want to boot with
[09:09] <bag83> bun-bun: no thats a bad option since the provider count the minutes
[09:09] <bun-bun> bag83# ahh i see
[09:09] <AlanHaggai> How can I put my Ubuntu system to sleep while it is downloading?
[09:09] <pianoboy3333> strabes: then run sudo update-grub
[09:09] <jeff__> POVaddct: my xserver is broken, so i guess the answer to your Q is "I use linux console"
=== miguel_ is now known as mdi
[09:09] <bag83> bun-bun: when their is no ADSL Tools is there one for modem or ISDN Connections?
[09:09] <pianoboy3333> AlanHaggai: leave it on, shut off your mouse keyboard and monitor ;)\
[09:09] <savvas> Samus_Aran: if you're still with 6.06 better forget about automatix, i heard it really is breaking stuff, can you tell me the name of the package you can't find?
[09:09] <bun-bun> bag83# i'm pretty sure i've seen a tool for that in kde, i'm sure gnome has one too
[09:09] <Dj_maclox> wena wena
[09:10] <Dj_maclox> soy de chile
[09:10] <bun-bun> bag83# i just can't think of one offhand
[09:10] <Dj_maclox> alguien habla espaol
[09:10] <jeff__> savvas: re:how's it going? -->apt-get xubuntu-desktop is still doing its thing.
[09:10] <POVaddct> jeff__: okay. if you want a smaller font size, you can boot with kernel boot option vga=791
[09:10] <AlanHaggai> pianoboy3333 : I am doing like that now. But, wanted to know if there was any way to 'sleep' the system as in windows
[09:10] <Samus_Aran> strabes: /etc/rc?.d/ contains symlinks to scripts in /etc/init.d/.  each runlevel has its own directory, e.g. /etc/rc3.d for runlevel 3.  you can choose what is loaded in each runlevel
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[09:10] <strabes> ok thanks
[09:10] <bun-bun> bag83# there are lots of tools for manipulating modem and isdn connections for linux
[09:11] <Samus_Aran> strabes: the default is that runlevel 0 shuts the system down, runlevel 6 reboots and various distros use 3, 4, and 5 for console-only and GUI (display login manager)
[09:11] <djmccormick> is there a way to specify which source i want a package from with apt-get
[09:11] <POVaddct> jeff__: do you know how to pass kernel boot parameters in grub?
[09:11] <virno> a, voy a chile esta enverno, pero no puedo hablar espanol muy bueno

[09:11] <dookness> Does Ubuntu Edgy support passwordless hibernate?
[09:12] <bag83> bun-bun: mh i can't find a userfriedly GUI Tool, such as Username, Passwd, (Telephonnumber) ...
[09:12] <savvas> jeff__: hehe ok
[09:12] <Samus_Aran> strabes: but if you felt like it, you could make your own runlevel up with custom services.  when you switch to another runlevel, scripts that are not contained in that runlevel (the links in /etc/rc<whatever>.d/*) are "stopped" and new ones are "start"ed
[09:12] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, the commerical repo for dapper will work for opera
[09:12] <bun-bun> bag83# is it using pppoe?
[09:12] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: strace -p nautilus does not work...
[09:12] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: process id, not the name.  get it from 'ps aux' or something, but I'm not sure if the information would be too useful for you
[09:13] <r2d2_here> from an apache script (with php exec) is it possible to start a GTK application in an existing gnome session ?
[09:13] <Samus_Aran> nothlit: Opera 9.x does not work for me on 6.06, I mean, it installs, but is unbelievably slow and has major font issues.  both static-qt and shared-qt.  I have downgraded to 8.54, which is nice and fast again
[09:13] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: might be easier to just kill that nautilus process and let gnome respawn it
[09:13] <bag83> bun-bun: the adsl stuff yes, but not the ISDN stuff
[09:13] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: I've tried that, it doesn't help
[09:13] <AlanHaggai> pianoboy3333 : any way to put to sleep?
[09:13] <bun-bun> bag83# you have both adsl and isdn?  i'm confused
[09:13] <Samus_Aran> savvas, nothlit: opera: Depends: xlib6g (>= 3.3.6) but it is not installable or xlibs but it is not installable
[09:13] <pianoboy3333> AlanHaggai: I really don't know
[09:13] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, oh i was scanning and read the dependency issues, i thought you were talking about edgy opera
[09:13] <djmccormick>  is there a way to specify which source i want a package from with apt-get
[09:13] <JosefK> pianoboy3333: it will if done correctly, unless the process has already been killed
[09:13] <pianoboy3333> AlanHaggai: if you find out, pm me
[09:14] <bag83> bun-bun:  i have ADSL but my Grandmother have ISDN :-)
[09:14] <AlanHaggai> pianoboy3333 : ok will do so. Thanks :)
[09:14] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, you tried both the dapper commercial repo and operas repo?
[09:14] <pianoboy3333> JosefK: ok, it's good now
[09:14] <bun-bun> bag83# ohhh ok
[09:14] <pianoboy3333> thanks....
[09:14] <dookness> POVaddct: Have you got any of your POV pix up on the net you could link to?
[09:14] <bun-bun> bag83# for your grandmother then i would recommend getting an isdn router like the old combinet (now cisco) routers

[09:15] <POVaddct> dookness: http://84.179.86.213:29011/   <-- temporary
[09:15] <kromel> Problem, when I reboot, I have to reattach my USB wireless mouse to get it to work.  Any suggestions?
[09:15] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, oh ok, because i had opera working on dapper about 2 weeks ago
[09:16] <jeff__> POVaddct: no i do not know how to pass kernel boot parameters in
[09:16] <jeff__> POVaddct: no i do not know how to pass kernel boot parameters in grub
[09:16] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, no dependency issue
[09:16] <bag83> bun-bun: yes that is an option, that means that ubuntu is missing such a tool and the recommend option is a router
[09:16] <bag83> bun-bun: ?
[09:17] <savvas> Samus_Aran: try from deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free
[09:17] <jeff__> how do i  scroll up in CLI (not in X)
[09:17] <jeff__> ?
[09:17] <bun-bun> bag83# it would be the option *i* would personally prefer, but as i said, i'm sure there are tools for this
[09:17] <jeff__> page up nor Shift-PageUP does'nt work
[09:17] <POVaddct> jeff__: when booting, you can press "e" to edit the selected line of the grub config. put "vga=791" before "splash" in the line starting with "kernel"
[09:17] <jeff__> POVaddct: ok
[09:17] <bag83> bun-bun: ok thanks, i will investigate
[09:17] <bun-bun> bag83# i think dan kegel did a lot of isdn work back in the early days of linux, try a search for his work
[09:17] <jeff__> savvas: it's done
[09:18] <jeff__> savvas: the apt-get of xubuntu-desktop is done.
[09:18] <virno> anyone have experience setting up an RT61 chipset wireless lan card?
[09:18] <JosefK> hmm, my system hangs for 1 minute between 'activating swapfile swap' and 'configuring network interfaces'
[09:18] <jeff__> what is 2 B done  now, friend?
[09:18] <JosefK> ideas anyone?
[09:18] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: scroll up in your IRC app, or on the console's internal buffer ?
[09:18] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: for the latter Shift+PageUp, but that won't help you on most IRC clients
[09:18] <Corbo> anyone:  pptpconfig: Depends: php-gtk-pcntl (>= 1.0.0) but it is not going to be installed E: Broken packages
[09:18] <jeff__> Samus_Aran: scroll in console (which is not in X)
[09:19] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: yeah, I got that, but applications handle scrolling themselves.  if you're in Bash, you can use Shift+PageUp
[09:19] <dookness> anyone tried hibernate under edgy?
[09:19] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: e.g. irssi uses PageUp to scroll up by default, but it can be changed
[09:19] <jeff__> savvas: i've finished running your command "apt-get xubuntu-desktop". how can i check whether xserver works now?
[09:19] <savvas> hm.. what was the init.d for xubuntu desktop.. xfce ?
[09:19] <gape> newbe here. Anybody know how to upgrade Firefox 1.5 to already downloaded and extracted Firefox 2
[09:20] <Corbo> can anyone tell me what this means: pptpconfig: Depends: php-gtk-pcntl (>= 1.0.0) but it is not going to be installed E: Broken packages
[09:20] <jeff__> savvas: i don't know what init.d is, but xubuntu uses xfce
[09:20] <nothlit> jeff__, do you have gdm xdm or kdm installed?
[09:20] <savvas> jeff__: ok try sudo /etc/init.d/xfce restart
[09:20] <jeff__> savvas: when you are talking to me, please use my name, because it's easier to track messages for me. thanks
[09:20] <savvas> ah xdm! :)
[09:20] <jeff__> nothlit: i don't know
[09:20] <capiCrimm> how can I unblock my soundcard, and check what is blocking it?
[09:20] <savvas> jeff__: use sudo /etc/init.d/xdm restart
[09:21] <jeff__> savvas: will i lose connection with you guys, if i do that?
[09:21] <JosefK> nvm, fixed my problem by removing the superfluous entries installed by default into /etc/network/interfaces
[09:21] <savvas> no jeff__
[09:21] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: wait
[09:21] <capiCrimm> isn't there a dir for all locks or something?
[09:21] <jeff__> Samus_Aran: ok
[09:21] <nothlit> jeff__, ls /etc/init.d | grep dm
[09:21] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: to switch between X and TTY, you can use Ctrl+Alt+F7 (to go to X) and Ctrl+Alt+F1 (to go to TTY1)
[09:21] <savvas> Samus_Aran: he's in console, can't do that
[09:21] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: if X screws up, you can use Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill it off
[09:21] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, why don't you try the repos
[09:22] <Samus_Aran> savvas: I know, I was explaining how to get back to IRC once their X is started
[09:22] <jeff__> sudo: /etc/init.d/xdm: command not found
[09:22] <dookness> capiCrimm: Just shut progs. Firefox/flash plugin can cause that
[09:22] <francesco_> jeff__: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[09:22] <jeff__> Samus_Aran: X is already borken
[09:22] <savvas> jeff__: do what nothlit said: ls /etc/init.d | grep dm
[09:23] <kokoko1> anybody remembers the name of the utitlity used to generate modeline for Xorg?
[09:23] <jeff__> savvas: nothlit here's the grep results: gdm, mdadm, mdadm-raid
[09:23] <mandelu1> is the acx100 wlan driver installed in ubuntu?
[09:23] <nothlit> jeff__, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[09:24] <Corbo> what is php-gtk-pcntl?
[09:24] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: I was just telling you how to switch back here (TTY with your IRC client), once X loads up
[09:24] <Samus_Aran> jeff__: as you will still be connected here
[09:24] <bun-bun> has anyone done a clean install of the final edgy release?  and if so, are you having issues with vi?
[09:24] <JosefK> bun-bun: install the 'vim' package
[09:24] <JosefK> bun-bun: by default it uses a gutted vim called vim-tiny, installing 'vim' replaces it
[09:25] <bun-bun> JosefK# ahh i didn't know that
[09:25] <bun-bun> JosefK# thanks for the tip
[09:25] <JosefK> np's
[09:25] <savvas> gdm.. weird :\
[09:25] <jerp> my question this hour: Is it safe to download the macromedia plugin when you're on a webpage with the Firefox browser; all I see in the user agreement is about Winblows.
[09:25] <nothlit> savvas, xubuntu-desktop automatically  uses gdm
[09:25] <bun-bun> under 6.06 i'm pretty sure it installed vim by default

[09:26] <flasher> i'm now logged on
[09:26] <dookness> capiCrimm: Is Firefox open?
[09:26] <flasher> thanks to your help
[09:27] <flasher> nothlit: savvas, i did the command you told me to do, whith is something like gdm restart
[09:27] <flasher> does this mean that whenever i reboot now, i can have NO problems?
[09:27] <flasher> or do i always have to type in the gdm restart command, savvas, nothlit
[09:27] <flasher> ?
[09:27] <savvas> flasher: you can reboot, yes
[09:27] <flasher> savvas: thanks so much!!!
[09:27] <flasher> i was getting tired being outside of the graphical world
[09:27] <Corbo> can someone take a few minutes to pm me through setting up pptpconfig?
[09:28] <savvas> flasher: one hint though
[09:28] <LjL> !pm
[09:28] <ubotu> Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first.
[09:28] <flasher> savvas: yes?
[09:28] <flasher> please.
[09:28] <jerp> nevermind I forgot to scroll down
[09:29] <nothlit> Flasher, no next time you restart it will automatically start gdm
[09:29] <savvas> flasher: when you have to upgrade your distro again, use the dist-upgrade, and then sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[09:29] <flasher> nothlit: thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:29] <dookness> anybody tried hibernate under edgy?

[09:29] <LjL> dookness: yes, works intermittently here
[09:29] <Bisclaveret> should i do an apt-get dist-upgrade?
[09:30] <flasher> savvas: because what i did was this: 1) in sources.list, replace the word dapper with edgy. 2) apt-get update 3)apt-get dist-upgrade
[09:30] <LjL> Bisclaveret: ?
[09:30] <stig> I just upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 - now my box freezes during boot - I can't seem to find a way out :(

[09:30] <LjL> Bisclaveret: you should upgrade, yes.
[09:30] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Bisclaveret about upgrade

[09:32] <savvas> *upgrade

[09:32] <LjL> Bisclaveret: hoary just went out of support. upgrade to breezy and then to dapper
[09:32] <flasher> savvas: yes, but for xubuntu people, they said update-manager had a problem, so that's why i didn't use it.
[09:32] <klonfabrik> thx

[09:39] <dookness> Corbo: Looks like yr running a 32bit version
[09:39] <Corbo> ok good
[09:39] <nothlit> Samus_Aran, yes but i make no assumptions about the spped, only that it may solve the dependency issue
[09:39] <Samus_Aran> tim__b: nope, ML-1610 here (the cheapest of the cheap Samsung laser printers, heh)
[09:39] <Corbo> I have a xeon, worth switching to 64bit or is it more trouble than it's worth?
[09:40] <Bisclaveret> how do i tell if i have conflicting packages?

[09:40] <Corbo> dookie: ok thanks
[09:40] <SethPell> thanks nothlit
[09:41] <EvanCarroll> Is there a utility that can tell me offset/size or anything else?
[09:41] <Samus_Aran> nothlit: I had Opera 9.x working without dependancy issues, but something is deeply wrong with it.  it would take 30 seconds to load links, would chug the hard drive for several seconds at random, it would convert a lot of standard fonts to this random hard-to-read font I have installed, etc.
[09:41] <Corbo> beef: cheers

[09:41] <LjL> beagleisevil, not in edgy
[09:41] <Samus_Aran> nothlit: Opera 8.54 is working as expected, half a second to load a new page, switching between tabs is instantaneous, etc.

[09:46] <chapium> does anyone here know how to change the default video player in firefox?  Totem keeps crashing and its freaking annoying
[09:46] <tim__b> Samus_Aran, i get: printer-stoped as msg in printer manager
[09:46] <capiCrimm> dookness, do you know how to enable multiple sound channels?
[09:46] <DrSpin> more concerned abous surround atm
[09:47] <savvas> Samus_Aran: can you tell me the broken dependency package again?
[09:47] <creature124> Corbo: I am dual booting XP....this is far from a leap of faith to linux
[09:47] <Samus_Aran> savvas: opera: Depends: xlib6g (>= 3.3.6) but it is not installable or xlibs but it is not installable
[09:47] <savvas> DrSpin: ah sorry then :)
[09:47] <beagleisevil> chapium, install the mplayer plugin for firefox
[09:47] <Corbo> creature: good call, how are you finding linux so far?
[09:47] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, I have xterm, is that wrong?
[09:47] <Samus_Aran> savvas: and that package is a dummy placeholder package, used to transition to a new package with Xorg 7.x (as far as I remember, when I looked it up before)
[09:48] <stig> can anyone help me please? my boot process freezes
[09:48] <creature124> corbo: not too bad, but I have hardly touched it really....only just now did I steel myself to actually use it a bit. Its been on my HDD for nearly a week >.>
[09:48] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: no, but there is an option that tells Bash how to draw characters on the screen, that info is stored in the "TERM" variable.  if it has the wrong TERM variable, things will get messed up
[09:48] <finalbeta> When selecting a style from gnome-look.org, does it matter if I pick a metacity/GTK2./GTK1...
[09:48] <SethPell> nothlit: Again, aptitude said there was nothing to get
[09:48] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: to see the current setting, you can go: echo $TERM
[09:48] <StormGuy> I'm having difficulty viewing the options on my Linksys Router's config page.  Can anyone help me?  It's almost as though the fonts aren't loading for the different options.
[09:49] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, I've initialized TERM with linux and has worked fine, thank you very much
[09:49] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: if you are in an Xterm, it should probably be set to "xterm-color".  if it is set to "linux" or "vt220" or whatnot it may not have all the expected features
[09:49] <EvanCarroll> is there a way to undelete the top panel
[09:50] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, I'm using gterm
[09:50] <nothlit> SethPell, well reinstall all of them with sudo aptitude reinstall
[09:50] <eduar-t> hola
[09:50] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: okay, then it likely does want "linux"
[09:50] <creature124> okay question - Is there a (relatively) easy to set up 2 monitors with different brands of video card?
[09:50] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: in the options menu for gterm you should be able to set the default TERM setting, so it won't forget it once you log out
[09:50] <savvas> Samus_Aran: have you read this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[09:50] <nothlit> SethPell, check if theres anything in your /usr/share/themes directory

[09:51] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, do you know why there is a ospeed message with less, it is ugly
[09:51] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: can you explain what you mean ?
[09:52] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, less: Symbol `ospeed' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking

[09:52] <eduar-t> hola
[09:52] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, it showed up the last ubuntu release
[09:53] <SethPell> nothlit: After reinstalling ubuntu-artwork and all the human-theme stuff, still nothing shows up in the Theme dialog. It looks like all the themes exist in my /usr/share/themes folder though
[09:53] <Puaff> eduar-t, pregunta, no digas hola
[09:53] <EvanCarroll> man this new version of gnome seems much more difficult to use
[09:53] <eduar-t> hello
[09:53] <EvanCarroll> i just acccidently delete the top panel, and I can't add a new panel by right clicking on the bottom panel - i can't save starting positon/size of gnome-terminal any more either
[09:54] <pygi> do we have network manager on ship cd?
[09:54] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, do you get the same warning?
[09:54] <eduar-t> tengo un problema en xubuntu en bandeja entrada

[09:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about router - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:55] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I agree about Gnome being more difficult to use by "simplifying", heh
[09:55] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, thank you very much for your help
[09:55] <Spee_Der> eduar-t: Try #ubuntu-es for Spanish.
[09:55] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: the linking error points to a shared library, not specifically less
[09:55] <Auridoll> Hello the chan
[09:56] <soundray> Need a tip: how can I determine the age difference between two files based on the time stamps
[09:56] <soundray> ?
[09:56] <Samus_Aran> Puaff: you could check which libraries less uses, and see if you have updated any of them with non-standard versions
[09:56] <eduar-t> error launching browser window: no XBL brinding for browser
[09:56] <EvanCarroll> Samus_Aran: totoal bull shit, no one can tell me how to save the size/position or how to restore the gnome-panel by default I mean i can just delete ~/.gnome and let it recreate the nonsense defaults, but i woulden't want me grandma using this.
[09:56] <RawSewage> What SoundKonverter plugin do I need to convert flac to ogg
[09:56] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, maybe is a man warning, I'm going to google it, just a sec
[09:56] <GhostFreeman> How come I can't install the newest Azureus in Edgy?
=== rex_binary is now known as rexbinary
[09:56] <eduar-t> no se que ocurre
[09:56] <EvanCarroll> Samus_Aran: I mean they reduce the default of virtual desktops to two, which means the cnocept is still confusing in that its new, but not enough virtual desktops to be really usefull.

[09:57] <EvanCarroll> it just seems ass backwards.
[09:57] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I agree entirely.  they work on this supposed user interface guidelines, but then it took me 10 minutes to figure out how to add an item to the menu ... (and I'm the one everyone comes to for computer help)
[09:57] <Auridoll> I'm running Edgy since a couple of days (dist-upgrade from dapper) and I'm not able anymore to play videos with MP3 encoded sound even with Mplayer or VLC, what could be the problem ?
[09:57] <eduar-t> Gracias
[09:57] <GhostFreeman> In the Software Updates app, It says there's a new version of Azureus, along with libggi2 in 'Distribution updates' but I can't add them to be updated -- what gives?
[09:57] <LevTermen> join #ubuntustudio
[09:58] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I agree on that, too.  either do 1 desktop for "ease of use", or 4+ for people that actually want to use the feature
[09:58] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I found new Gnome versions had way less options available by right-clicking on things
[09:58] <fuoco> how do i burn a dvd/video from a miniDV camera?
[09:58] <mr-russ> does anybody know of any problems running Ubuntu on IBM x3400 ?
[09:58] <osacix> hi i have problems with ndiswrapper
[09:58] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: even the ancient Gnome versions had more options by right-clicking on parts of the user interface
[09:59] <SethPell> Can anyone tell me why themes that I have installed (according to aptitude and synaptic) and exist in my /usr/share/themes folder don't show up in the themes dialog box?
[09:59] <EvanCarroll> Samus_Aran: except deleting panels they keep that stupid option
[09:59] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: heh

[09:59] <Corbo> questions questions questions
[09:59] <savvas> Samus_Aran: try download package libqt3-mt
[09:59] <osacix> i make the instalation the packages
[09:59] <soundray> osacix: what have you entered to get that?
[09:59] <osacix> ndiswrapper-utils  ndisgtk
[09:59] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I recommend going to the official channel for Gnome (it's not on this network), as I think I heard one of them saying how to reset missing panels easily (by "easily", I mean "easily if you know how", heh)
[10:00] <osacix> i install the drivers for my wifi card
[10:00] <EvanCarroll> thats fine, just tell me how =/
[10:00] <ashzilla> EvanCarroll: what's your problem?
[10:00] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: irc://irc.gimp.org/#gnome is the official network for GTK+, The GIMP, Gnome and some other projects
[10:00] <StormGuy> I'm having difficulty viewing the options on my Linksys Router's config page.  It's almost as though the fonts aren't loading for the different options.
[10:00] <erUSUL> !fonts
[10:00] <ubotu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto
[10:00] <ubotu> No fonts in flash? Install msttcorefonts, gsfonts, and gsfonts-x11 , No fonts in mplayer? see !mplayer
[10:01] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: I don't remember how, myself, sorry.  I use ICEWM here and the rest of my family use KDE
[10:01] <EvanCarroll> ashzilla: a) I can't figure out how to undo my stupid mistake of deleting the top panel, and b) I can't figure out how to save the window positions/size in the new gnome -- google shows i'm supposed to use offset w/ --geometery, but how am I supposed to find its current position, and is there kosher way to alias it in gnome
[10:01] <soundray> osacix: what did you enter before you got that error message?
[10:01] <thevenin> when i try to install ubuntu server 6.10
[10:02] <osacix> when i make the modprobe ndiswrapper
[10:02] <Samus_Aran> savvas: libqt3-mt is already the newest version.
[10:02] <Auridoll> I'm running Edgy since a couple of days (dist-upgrade from dapper) and I'm not able anymore to play videos with MP3 encoded sound even with Mplayer or VLC, what could be the problem ? Sound like missing a "mp3 lib" I guess, what could be the good package ?   Mplayer error is : "Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available. enable it at compilation"
[10:02] <Puaff> Samus_Aran, I find nothing, doesn't matter, it is just ugly but it is not a problem
[10:02] <thevenin> it says their was a problem reading the data from the disc, but when i run the disc integrity checker it passes
[10:02] <EvanCarroll> Auridoll: you need the ugly/bad plugins
[10:02] <thevenin> this is the second CD i have tried, could it be a bad CD drive
[10:02] <thevenin> ubuntu server 6.10 once was installed
[10:03] <HumanPrototype> hi all

[10:03] <jerp> Does anyone have a webpage on how to uninstall firefox 1.5 and reinstall 2.0 ?
[10:04] <kbrosnan> jerp: don't uninstall 1.5, and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewFirefoxVersion
[10:04] <soundray> osacix: what do you get when you enter 'lsmod | grep ndis'?
[10:04] <Samus_Aran> savvas: I installed the official 6.06 version just after it was released, to a clean partition (switched from Arch Linux in June)
[10:04] <jerp> thanks
[10:04] <SethPell> Can anyone tell me why themes that I have installed (according to aptitude and synaptic) and exist in my /usr/share/themes folder don't show up in the themes dialog box?
[10:05] <Auridoll> ok, gonna check it out EvanCarroll
[10:05] <Samus_Aran> SethPell: themes for Gnome/GTK+ or what ?
[10:05] <soundray> SethPell: have you restarted gnome since you installed them?
[10:05] <osacix> DONT RETURN NOTHING
[10:05] <Auridoll> nothing better EvanCarroll
[10:05] <SethPell> Samus_Aran: Gnome, I think (whatever the default Ubuntu installation is)
[10:06] <luisbg> what's the difference between python2.4 and python2.4-dev... aren't both to develop since it's a programming language?
[10:06] <soundray> osacix: drop your caps, please. What do you get when you run 'sudo modprobe ndiswrapper'?
[10:06] <LjL> !caps | osacix
[10:06] <ubotu> osacix: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[10:06] <osacix> ok
[10:06] <SethPell> soundray: Sort of... I upgraded from dapper (my bad) and it restarted during the upgrade. Does that count?
[10:06] <Samus_Aran> soundray: you shouldn't need to restart.  well, I would hope not, I can switch themes even in ICEWM in realtime with "gtk-theme-switcher" ("switch" and "switch2" utilities)
[10:06] <EvanCarroll> I got the panel recreated
[10:06] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: good to hear
[10:06] <Samus_Aran> EvanCarroll: what did you do to bring it back ?
[10:07] <SethPell> soundray: Although I'm not necessarily looking for new themes, every theme I had no longer shows up in the dialog
[10:07] <soundray> SethPell, Samus_Aran: agreed, but I thought it might be a good idea to force a reread that way.
[10:07] <cntb> is ti possible to install edgy from internet booting with liveCD dapper ubuntu ?
[10:07] <voraistos> hello people. i wanted to know.. did anybody report any kernel panic (the kind that are too numerous?) or any sudden crashes on edgy ? Or even mail from syslog every 10 minutes ?
[10:08] <osacix> fatal: error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.15-26-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko):invalid argument
[10:08] <soundray> cntb: no, you can only install dapper with a dapper CD. After that, you can upgrade. Better to get an edgy CD, though.
[10:08] <cntb> is it possible to install edgy from internet,starting from  booting with liveCD dapper ubuntu , and download installing?
[10:08] <EvanCarroll> Samus_Aran: made room on the bottom panel to actually right cilck on it, different areas of the panel bring up different things and it as clogged with minimized windows
[10:08] <cntb> ty soundray
[10:08] <cntb> suse has over the net install
[10:09] <cntb> so I thoght maybe ubuntu crew did smthing similar
[10:09] <bthornton> I'm running 32-bit Dapper and would like to attempt to upgrade to 64-bit Edgy (I've upgraded the CPU on this machine since I've installed Dapper).  Anybody know if this is possible?
[10:09] <Random_Transit> hey, can anyone tell me why i can't edit song info for mpeg4/aac files?
[10:09] <v-dogg> isn't there any minicd-releases?
[10:09] <Slothbag1> anyone know how to get setterm -powersave to work at boot? I get cannot un(set) error
[10:09] <voraistos> coz i had this machine working fine on dapper, upgraded it to the beta, still fine. wiped out the drive to install the edgy release, twice now, and now the system is gone again. i checked and recheck the hardware, it doesnt seem to be related.
[10:09] <apokryphos> bthornton: no, you need a full new install
[10:09] <cntb> ok so what is the fastest dl  link for one CD edgy ?
[10:09] <SethPell> Samus_Aran, soundray: I'm trying the restart to see what it does. I'll be back in a few
[10:10] <n0dl|laptop> hello im getting this error message saying that the GNOME settings daemon has some error starting. The last error message is System eception:IDL:Bonobo/GeneralError:1.0 :Child process did not give an error message unknown failure occured
[10:10] <bthornton> dern, I was a-feared of that
[10:10] <n0dl|laptop> how can i fix this?
[10:10] <soundray> cntb: there is a net install method for ubuntu, too, I think
[10:10] <apokryphos> cntb: try a mirror close to you; the torrents will be very fast too.
[10:10] <osacix> sorry the upcase :(
[10:10] <voraistos> #ubuntu-dev
[10:10] <shiv> what is wrong here shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ sudo ./install
[10:10] <shiv> sudo: unable to execute ./install: Permission denied
[10:10] <cntb> just google ubuntu edgy torrent?
[10:10] <apokryphos> shiv: perhaps it needs to be executable
[10:11] <ashzilla> Hi. I updated my kernel and headers to 2.6.17-10-generic, and when I try to launch VMware the server does not  start and I'm left with the following error: /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware:   /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libpng12.so.0/libpng12.so.0: no version information available (required by   /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2)
[10:11] <apokryphos> cntb: you can get the torrents from the download page
[10:11] <shiv> apokryphos: how do I make it
[10:11] <Samus_Aran> shiv: it means it doesn't have execute permissions for your user
[10:11] <^Down> What's the command to mount a USB flash drive
[10:11] <apokryphos> shiv: chmod +x install
[10:11] <Samus_Aran> shiv: chmod a+rx ./install
[10:11] <soundray> osacix: do you have a file /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper ?
[10:11] <apokryphos> ^Down: it should mount automatically, but if not, use mount
[10:12] <Samus_Aran> ^Down: USB Mass Storage devices will show up as SCSI hard drives
[10:12] <^Down> I am, but what is the /dev/ thing?
[10:12] <Samus_Aran> ^Down: so for example /dev/sda
[10:12] <phaedra> ashzilla, Did you run vmware-config.pl after the upgrade?
[10:12] <^Down> sda was not found
[10:12] <apokryphos> ^Down: well /dev/sd*
[10:12] <osacix> no
[10:12] <cntb> how to change sources from dapper to edgy ?
[10:13] <Samus_Aran> ^Down: your device may have partitions (/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2) or use the whole disk (/dev/sda).  to list all available hard drives: fdisk -l
[10:13] <osacix> i have alone the arch directory in this path
[10:13] <osacix> ops
[10:13] <shiv> apokryphos: Samus_Aran: no luck still the same :(
[10:13] <apokryphos> cntb: why? You should be following the guide to upgrade.
[10:13] <^Down> Does it matter if it's USB?
[10:13] <Slothbag1> "setterm -blank 1 -powersave powerdown -powerdown 1" from a boot script returns cannot un(set)... in edgy.. any ideas?
[10:13] <apokryphos> shiv: still 'permission denied'?
[10:13] <The_Machine> could someone help me with vmware?
[10:13] <cntb> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-193952.html
[10:13] <shiv> apokryphos: ya
[10:13] <apokryphos> ^Down: no, we're taking that into account.
[10:13] <The_Machine> it's more of a permissions issue than anything, but it's related to my vmware
[10:13] <apokryphos> shimmer: what install file is this?
[10:13] <shiv> apokryphos: this is a mounted iso image
[10:14] <cntb> http://tinyurl.com/ybflyf that one ?
[10:14] <Samus_Aran> ^Down: for the filesystem, it will most likely be FAT16 or FAT32, so use the "vfat" filesystem type, e.g.: mount -t vfat -o rw,user /dev/sda1 /mnt/my_usb_disk
[10:14] <apokryphos> ahh, shiv: perheps you didn't mount it with exec option then
=== Tom39Away_ is now known as Tom39Away
[10:14] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: what problem are you having ?
[10:14] <apokryphos> cntb: the channel topic, see the link after "Upgrade:"
[10:14] <shiv> apokryphos: how do I do that?
[10:14] <Samus_Aran> shiv: paste me the result of this command: \ls -l ./install
[10:15] <The_Machine> Samus_Aran: I want to load a physical disk as a Hard drive in order to make it so i can load an image from it
[10:15] <soundray> osacix: you need to activate your Windows driver and do the modprobe after that.
[10:15] <blazemonger> are there any linux apps that will correct my monitor settings like the geometry and the trapezoid settings
[10:15] <The_Machine> I start vmware as root (sudo vmware)
[10:15] <Samus_Aran> shiv: I missed the part about a loopback mounted ISO image
[10:15] <shiv> Samus_Aran: shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ \ls -l ./install
[10:15] <shiv> -r-xr-xr-x 1 root root 39499 2004-07-14 01:34 ./install
[10:15] <shiv> shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$
[10:15] <The_Machine> and load it up, but when i start the machine, it says i don't have permission
[10:15] <apokryphos> shiv: mount with the exec option
[10:15] <blazemonger> since someone was playing with my display's setting
[10:15] <osacix> dont have nothink in this path, alone the arch, /etc/modprobe.d
[10:15] <The_Machine> man, it's going to be complicated to explain
[10:15] <SethPell> Samus_Aran, soundray: I'm back from the restart, and, besides there still being nothing in the themes dialog, the current theme got even more retro
[10:15] <The_Machine> but basically, even as root i'm getting a permission denied
[10:15] <cntb> http://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  ???
[10:16] <bthornton> blazemonger: I'm betting that there aren't, since those settings are controlled by the hardware in your monitor (which makes them very manufacturer specific)
[10:16] <osacix> why=
[10:16] <apokryphos> shiv: so -o exec
[10:16] <creature124> Question: How do I exit my 'X session'? I am trying to install Xfree86, becuse I think its a step in the right direction to getting my second monitor set up.
[10:16] <Samus_Aran> shiv: ISO9660 filesystems are read-only, so the "chmod" command wouldn't have done anything.  that is already executable, they most likely screwed up the shebang line (first line of the script, which tells it how to run)
[10:16] <apokryphos> creature124: no, you'll want to use xinerama
[10:16] <Samus_Aran> shiv: try specifying a shell to run the script with, e.g.: sudo bash install
[10:16] <apokryphos> xfree86 is old and dated
[10:16] <bthornton> blazemonger: If there were any such thing, it would probably have to be propietary.  To my knowledge, there is no interface to those settings through the monitor cable.
[10:16] <StormGuy> I've tried installing the fonts I found in various helps and wikis on Ubuntu...so it may not be a font problem, but I can't seem to view any of the options on my Linksys Router's config page

[10:17] <Samus_Aran> shiv: otherwise it will look in your $PATH for "install"
[10:17] <The_Machine> Cannot open the disk '/var/lib/vmware/Virtual Machines/XPPro/XPPro-2.vmdk' or one of the snapshot disks it depends on.
[10:17] <The_Machine> Reason: Insufficient permission to access file.
[10:17] <creature124> apokryphos: I read that it was included in Xfree86...is there another way to get it? Xinerama is my goal.
[10:17] <blazemonger> bthornton:ouch i don't feel like spending hours adjusting monitor settings
[10:17] <shiv> Samus_Aran: I get this shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ sudo bash ./install
[10:17] <pygi> It says "The Network Manager applet could not find some required resources. It cannot continue"
[10:17] <shiv> Setup aborted . . .
[10:17] <shiv> The installer cannot be run when your current directory is on the CD.
[10:17] <shiv> Change to the target MATLAB installation directory and rerun the installer.
[10:17] <soundray> osacix: don't worry about it. Load the windows driver, then do the modprobe.
[10:17] <The_Machine> is the error i get when i power it on - now, if i don't have the physical disk (hard drive) being used, it starts up fine.  It's only when i include that is it not working
[10:17] <bthornton> blazemonger: There should only be a few settings: trapezoid, pincushon, width, height...
[10:17] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: paste me the result of: \ls -l '/var/lib/vmware/Virtual Machines/XPPro/XPPro-2.vmdk'
[10:17] <bthornton> blazemonger: It's just a matter of what "looks right"
[10:17] <blazemonger> bthornton:they're a pain to set
[10:18] <apokryphos> creature124: the first thread is two years old
[10:18] <MtJB> MS and SUSE in a partnership?
[10:18] <osacix> but i have instaled this .inf
[10:18] <bthornton> blazemonger: That they are.

[10:18] <blazemonger> i dont know how to get it to the default settings i had before
[10:18] <apokryphos> creature124: so is the second thread, don't use that, actually. Try to ignore those
[10:18] <bthornton> blazemonger: if it helps, your monitor should have a default profile of settings that you can reset to (or, some do anyway).  Maybe reset to that as a reference point and you'll be halfway there?
[10:18] <apokryphos> MtJB: well, MS and Novell, but yes.
[10:18] <osacix> ndiswrapper -l return: neti2220 driver present, hardware present
[10:18] <creature124> apokryphos: okay then...how would I go about getting Xinerama then?
[10:19] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: so that one is usable only by root user.  if you want your regular user to use it, you need to change the ownership, or add permissions for the user
[10:19] <Spee_Der> Is anyone here using the Matroc G400 dual video driver in Ubuntu/Dapper ?
[10:19] <apokryphos> creature124: it's in the repositories, use Synaptic
[10:19] <The_Machine> Samus_Aran: i'm starting vmware using root (sudo)
[10:19] <Spee_Der> Matrox that is.
[10:19] <soundray> osacix: now do the 'sudo modprobe ndiswrapper'.
[10:19] <bthornton> blazemonger: anywho, I'm off to work; perhaps someone else can be more helpful.  good luck.
[10:19] <The_Machine> it still isn't letting me start up that virtual machine
[10:19] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: which is A Very Bad Idea (tm)

[10:20] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: just chmod the device to allow your user access to it
[10:20] <creature124> thanks much for the help
[10:20] <The_Machine> Samus_Aran: that would make sense if ROOT could do it in the first place
[10:20] <The_Machine> but since root is unable to, and it has full rights to, then there's another problem
[10:21] <The_Machine> could you help me determine what that problem is?
[10:21] <blazemonger> it'z like thigz look like a triangle

[10:21] <blazemonger> lol
[10:21] <Samus_Aran> The_Machine: you pasted a virtual hard drive, I thought that was the permission problem.  I misunderstood

[10:22] <The_Machine> it is virtual.  The problem is this..  I have a regular vmware session all set up.  One of the hard drives has to use the "use the physical disk" option
[10:22] <Samus_Aran> I should try Quake 3 Arena again, it would run so fast on my new graphics card, heh
[10:22] <Samus_Aran> even on my old GeForce 2 MX400 it was very fast
[10:22] <osacix> ok
[10:22] <SethPell> Samus_Aran, soundray: I'm back from the restart, and, besides there still being nothing in the themes dialog, the current theme got even more retro

[10:23] <azureal> DrSpin, wait, are you saying sound _is_ kernel dependent...?
[10:23] <osacix> the system say me modprobe config already contains alias directive
[10:23] <Samus_Aran> SethPell: you may be missing "theme engines", which are small programs that specify how to do special themes, such as rounded corners, or ones that have transparent or bumpy edges, or ones that use vector graphics

[10:23] <Samus_Aran> SethPell: check your package manager for "theme engines"
[10:23] <DrSpin> azureal: well the kernel has to load a driver for the adapter

[10:35] <Samus_Aran> noxxle: well, 50 seconds to the desktop from power on with a full BIOS RAM check and so on is about normal, but if it is taking more than 10 seconds from the time you press Enter on your password until you're able to use the Gnome desktop, that is not right

[10:37] <Samus_Aran> morgue: if you do find that you need the physical device, then your only two solutions are to burn the device to a physical disc and pop it in the drive, or else use VirtualCD, which is a Linux-kernel module which lets you use a bin/cue disc image as a physical device

[10:38] <morgue> erUSUL, excuse me?
[10:38] <HumanPrototype> LjL, thanks
[10:38] <Samus_Aran> morgue: if you like I can send you either the source code for bin2iso, or the compiled binary.  I just tested and it still works on Ubuntu (also worked on Slackware and Arch Linux, heh)
[10:38] <erUSUL> morgue: bchunk is the program to turn a bin/cue pair to an iso image
[10:39] <noxxle> does ubuntu boot to init 3 by default? or 5?
[10:39] <morgue> samu, let me try what erUSUL is telling me, bchunk
[10:39] <Samus_Aran> I tried several apps which converted bin/cue files into iso's, and most of them didn't work properly
[10:39] <voraistos> hey. how do i know which patches does the ubuntu devs apply to the original kernel ? (the kernel.org one ?)
[10:39] <MtJB_> can you play wma file video on ubuntu?
[10:39] <erUSUL> noxxle: 'less /etc/inittab'
[10:40] <Samus_Aran> I kept the one that worked best (which was bin2iso), though I don't know if I ever tried bchunk or not, this was years ago now
[10:40] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell MtJB_ about wma
[10:40] <Samus_Aran> MtJB_: yes, if you install the appropriate codecs
[10:40] <sync350> rem: thanks a bunch
[10:40] <morgue> erUSUL, do I run that from terminal or from applications menu?
[10:40] <creature124> question - what is the name of the built in ubuntu ati driver?
[10:41] <Samus_Aran> noxxle: just type in "runlevel" and it will tell you which you're in, as well as the one you were previously in, if you switched
[10:41] <morgue> erUSUL, i already installed it
[10:41] <VigoFuse> Other than trashing new winXP install, what is a way to partition HDD without shareware or poohing the MBR,MFT?
[10:41] <erUSUL> morgue: from terminal
[10:41] <The_Machine> DISKLIB-LINK insufficient permission to access file
[10:41] <savvas> VigoFuse: qtparted maybe?
[10:41] <bthibault> I have a few printers installed via CUPS and I share them to Windows boxes via Samba, is there anyway to set the default color option to grayscale so i dont' have all my users wasting the color
[10:41] <VigoFuse> I could not find that
[10:41] <Samus_Aran> VigoFuse: are you trying to resize partitions, or just boot into two O/S'es ?
[10:41] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)...
[10:42] <noxxle> it says runlevel n2?~?~ is that possible
[10:42] <Samus_Aran> PuRu: I had TV out working years ago, and when I tried a while back to make it work, I wasn't able to figure it out again =/

[10:43] <noxxle> Samus_Aran what do you mean? what could the problem be
[10:43] <noxxle> it says N 2
[10:43] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: yes, go to the CUPS administration web page
[10:43] <VigoFuse> I would like my win2k to boot,but xp snags that one, I am now figureing out the way to get an Ubuntu on HDD and boot.
[10:43] <Samus_Aran> noxxle: you pasted a bunch of gibberish, I figured you meant that is what showed up on your screen
[10:43] <creature124> question - what is the name of dapper's built in ati driver?
[10:43] <noxxle> Samus_Aran now N 2 showed up, what does that mean?
[10:44] <PuRu> Samus_Aran: Yeah its really weird lol, asks for binutils, and i cant seem to be able to install binutils...
[10:44] <crass> PuRu: try nvtv
[10:44] <Samus_Aran> noxxle: your default runlevel is in the top of /etc/inittab
[10:44] <Samus_Aran> so it is 2 on Ubuntu
[10:44] <Samus_Aran> # The default runlevel.
[10:44] <Samus_Aran> id:2:initdefault:
[10:44] <erUSUL> creature124: if you mean the free driver it is ati or radeon
[10:44] <morgue> erUSUL, can you show me an example? i'm confused by the commands, say i wanna do asdf.bin to asdf.iso
[10:44] <creature124> it will be radeon, as i have a radeon 9200 ty
[10:44] <cntb> dapper drake 6.06 had one funny bug. whenever kernel was upgraded 2 new lines were added to grub menu.lst.
[10:44] <cntb> so far so good. but degault boot line was not corrected properly so . it ended up memory testing for example if windows boot was two lines below memory testing
[10:44] <Samus_Aran> # Runlevel 0 is halt.  Runlevel 1 is single-user.  Runlevels 2-5 are multi-user.  Runlevel 6 is reboot.
[10:45] <cntb> LjL:  that may be of interest
[10:45] <Samus_Aran> so the way Ubuntu uses runlevels, you're free to use 2 through 5 any way you like.  most distros use 3 for "multiuser (TTY only)" and 4 or 5 for GUI login manager
[10:45] <Samus_Aran> noxxle: that was for you, forgot to use your nickname
[10:45] <PuRu> crass: i'll look into that later
[10:45] <PuRu> need to go soon
[10:46] <bthibault> Samsu_Aran: ok , where to from the CUPS admin page?
[10:46] <LjL> cntb, well, to me dapper always added new kernels as the first line, i.e. line 0
[10:47] <erUSUL> morgue: basically bchunk image.bin image.cue image.iso
[10:47] <Loceur> how do I run a gnome-terminal session THEN run a command in that session (not like gnome-terminal -e"ls" as ls runs then closes term)
[10:47] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: log into it with your current username and password (assuming that "sudo" is set up to let your user adminster, which is default for the first user of the system)
[10:47] <voraistos> .
[10:47] <bthibault> Samsu_Aran: ok , i'm there
[10:48] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: find your printer in the Printers tab, click it, then there should be a row of options.  find the one for printing defaults, it will have all sorts of options like paper size, colour, ink levels, etc.  depends on the printer
[10:48] <sirbijan> hey ppl
[10:48] <blazemonger> are there any kind of ideal settings for adjustinhg a crt display
[10:48] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: the CUPS webpage update settings in realtime, so as soon as you change it, it will have the configuration saved
[10:48] <blazemonger> sorry if it sounds like a dumb question
[10:49] <cntb> hey sirbijan
[10:49] <sirbijan> I can't copy the contents of a VCD mpegav directory (the .dat files) into my hard drive in ubuntu
[10:49] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: that depends 100% on what your objective is =)
[10:49] <sirbijan> you can easily do it in windows
[10:49] <sirbijan> does it need any sort of ripping program in linux?
[10:49] <sobersabre> hi. I have a problem with gnome's media detection. there was a time when my gnome detected a CD/DVD and would place an icon on the desktop, and in nautilus. but now I need to mount manually..... where do I configure this ?
[10:49] <blazemonger> to adjust the display so it doesnt look like a triangle
[10:49] <PuRu> need to go soon
[10:49] <bthibault> Samsu_Aran: I see all kinds of paper size options and resolution
[10:49] <sirbijan> I've been having this problem for such a long time, I never asked, i duuno why!
[10:49] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)
[10:49] <bthibault> but no color options
[10:49] <sobersabre> I use ubuntu 6.06
[10:49] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: if you're a printing company, then you would use printing profiles to tune the monitor to your specific printer.  if you're a Joe Schmoe, I recommend a radiation screen or turning the brightness down so your eyes don't fry =p
[10:49] <Samus_Aran> (assuming you don't use a flat-panel)
[10:50] <blazemonger> i dont
[10:50] <blazemonger> wish i had a flat pannel
[10:50] <blazemonger> heh
[10:50] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: hm.  that surprises me
[10:50] <sirbijan> any ideas?
[10:50] <cntb> sirbijan: using VideoLAN ?
[10:50] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: my printer doesn't have colour, so I'm not sure what to suggest
[10:50] <blazemonger> why does it surprise you?
[10:50] <blazemonger> mm
[10:50] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: it surprises me because my printer has so many options on that screen
[10:50] <bthibault> Samus_Aran: I don't think the driver i have has any options for colr
[10:51] <sirbijan> VideoLan is a movie playing program cntb , right?
[10:51] <leofender> hi
[10:51] <luz> !schedule
[10:51] <ubotu> Ubuntu uses a strict timetable for releases, which means that sometimes newly released programs miss the timetable. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases for more. Edgy schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseSchedule
[10:51] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: are you using a generic driver, instead of a specific one for the model of printer ?
[10:51] <sirbijan> I just mean to copy the files into my hard drive
[10:51] <blazemonger> isn't there a way i can adjust the frequency of the video card
[10:51] <sirbijan> i wana copy'em
[10:51] <cntb> Guys are new xerox printers linux compatible enough? B/W as well as colour laser ?
[10:51] <blazemonger> so the monitor will display accurately
[10:51] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: oops, that was meant for bthibault
[10:51] <cntb> copy'em then play'em how?
[10:51] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: are you using a generic driver, instead of a specific one for the model of printer ?
[10:52] <savvas> does anyone know a tutorial to download ubuntu desktop from jigdo?
[10:52] <sirbijan> well, playing is easy, i just use VLC and enter the address, sth like /media/cdrom
[10:52] <sirbijan> but copying the files should be like any other file, shouldn't it?
[10:52] <bthibault> Samus_Aran: No, i'm using the specific one for my printer
[10:52] <sirbijan> after all they're just some big files in the mpegav directory
[10:53] <bthibault> Samus_Aran: Can I do it by editing the .ppd file ?

[10:53] <creature124> ow...my head hurts. I guess that linux to a tee right there...
[10:53] <cpl-tnt44> I'v read the Wifi docs and still cant connect to my wireless a little help would be appriciated
[10:53] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: I know very little about CUPS, sorry.  I've never tried editing a PPD file.  perhaps try googling for: disable colour printing
[10:54] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: er, make that as: cups disable colour printing
[10:54] <cpl-tnt44> Situation is like this  PLZ  help : Could not enable the interface eth1 > Check that the settings are correct for this network and that the computer is correctly connected to it.
[10:54] <sirbijan> have you ever copied them cntb ?
[10:54] <Samus_Aran> bthibault: and spell colour the american way, heh.  "color".  sheesh.

[10:55] <KirikaPhoenix> No chance any could give me a hand with a problem? I can't seem to get the 2.6 kernel source no matter what im trying....
[10:55] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)
[10:55] <cpl-tnt44> Kirika tried synaptic ?
[10:55] <rz1> hello
[10:55] <cpl-tnt44> !Kernel
[10:55] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[10:56] <luz> how to acces #ubuntu+1 ?
[10:56] <blazemonger> i tried xvidtune
[10:56] <erUSUL> luz: /j #ubuntu+1
[10:56] <erUSUL> luz: in xchat or other chat client
[10:56] <KirikaPhoenix> Cpl -i've tried everything I can think. I'm updated the repositories as listed but its still insists that the latest kernel-source avaliable is 2.4
[10:56] <cpl-tnt44> plz some 1 address to my quastion above ...?
[10:56] <KirikaPhoenix> For the life of me I can't get it to find the 2.6 source
[10:56] <pirofwil> can someone tell me how i change the default page for apache?
[10:57] <cpl-tnt44> maybe it is the latest ?
[10:57] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: first off, if the screen is radically screwed up, then it is a driver issue, not a setting
[10:57] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: first step: enter the refresh rate range for your monitor manually in xorg.conf
[10:57] <sc0tt_> a/topic
[10:57] <erUSUL> KirikaPhoenix: linux-source linux-source-2.6.15
[10:57] <sc0tt_> oops
[10:57] <sc0tt_> =] 
[10:57] <rise`> which is better for 3D applications Xubuntu or just Ubuntu or does it matter? i guess will older card run better on either of the systems?
[10:57] <cpl-tnt44> KirikaPhoenix mayvbe it is the latest ?
[10:58] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: second step: find a video mode that works well with your monitor, and set that as the default resolution
[10:58] <cpl-tnt44> Situation is like this  PLZ  help : Could not enable the interface eth1 > Check that the settings are correct for this network and that the computer is correctly connected to it.
[10:58] <pirofwil> can someone tell me how i change the default page for apache?
[10:58] <axa-axa> Hi, can someone please tell me how can I decrease the space between menu items in menu, so ti look like menu in Windows?
[10:58] <cpl-tnt44> this is conserning wireless network
[10:58] <erUSUL> KirikaPhoenix: apt-cache search linux-source
[10:58] <rbil> axa-axa: why would you want anything to look like Windoze?
[10:59] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: for example my monitor/driver for whatever reason can do 320x240, 400x300, 640x480, 1024x768 and 1280x1024 fine, but it royally screws up on 1280x960
[10:59] <bobesponja> it looks like GNUbuntu is finally coming to life http://digg.com/tech_news/Stallman_the_chief_GNUsanse_finally_gets_gNewSense
[10:59] <axa-axa> rbil: well that way it would ocupy less space,that's all.
[10:59] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: also keep in mind that if your monitor is turned off when you boot up Xorg, it won't be able to autodetect your monitor settings.  that is one more reason to manually put in the refresh ranges for the monitor
[10:59] <axa-axa> Anyone?
[11:00] <rz1> can anyone help with nat?
[11:00] <PuRu> i'm out, will be back in about an hour, if anyone knows some tips, please drop them off by private message
[11:00] <PuRu> does anyone know how to get my tv-out working? i find lots of completely different stuff about it :-S (a nvidia card)
[11:00] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: use xvidtune if your monitor does not remember settings for individual modes (e.g. an old monitor with analog dials on it)
[11:01] <buzznut> any postfix gurus around? Having trouble with sasl for 2 days and I just don't get it
[11:01] <blazemonger> Samus_Aran: things like the geometry settings are screwed ..and cant find the right trapezoid settings i had before
[11:01] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: otherwise steer clear of it
[11:01] <KirikaPhoenix> erUSUL, xen-source-2.6.17
[11:01] <blazemonger> cant get them aligned properly
[11:01] <morgue> erUSUL, it's not working
[11:01] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: if you were playing with your monitor controls, find the reset option
[11:01] <blazemonger> i dont have a reset option
[11:01] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: defaults are better than trying to fix it when it's all mucked up
[11:01] <blazemonger> is there a software way to reset  monitor
[11:01] <morgue> erUSUL, when I try this $ bchunk hlm-mvp5a.bin hlm-mvp5a.iso, I get the help text
[11:02] <VigoFuse> Neto digg
[11:02] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: I've not seen a monitor that had digital controls but no reset option for several years now
[11:02] <Samus_Aran> blazemonger: some monitors have an actual button for resetting the options to factory defaults
[11:02] <KirikaPhoenix> okay, lets give this a try...
[11:02] <zlack> blazemonger: it really should be in the monitor menu
[11:02] <osacix> i need one help with ndiswrapper :(
[11:03] <zlack> blazemonger: or maybe a combination of 2 buttons
[11:03] <cntb> sorry sirbijan no
[11:03] <erUSUL> morgue: and the cue file?
[11:03] <Samus_Aran> morgue: do you want me to send you the bin2iso ?  I know it works, I used it a half dozen times
[11:03] <axa-axa> Hi, can someone please tell me how can I decrease the space between menu items in menu, so ti look like menu in Windows?
[11:03] <cntb> just like you on windows
[11:03] <erUSUL> KirikaPhoenix: you are using edgy?
[11:03] <buzznut> edgy+postfix+sasl+mysql = frustration -- I am moving from debian to ubuntu server, is this the right place for help?
[11:03] <morgue> Samus_Aran, kk
[11:03] <KirikaPhoenix> erUSUL, yes
[11:03] <pygi> buzznut: #ubuntu-server
[11:04] <buzznut> pygi: thanks
[11:04] <pygi> buzznut: you are welcome :)
[11:04] <axa-axa> never mind I'm probably in the wrong place anyway.
[11:04] <Samus_Aran> morgue: if you want to compile the source one, just go: gcc bin2iso.c -o bin2iso
[11:04] <Samus_Aran> morgue: it has no dependancies other than libc
[11:04] <savvas> why doesn't ubuntu desktop cd have a jigdo file? :(
[11:04] <blazemonger> is thee a way i can get my mon to the factory defaults
[11:05] <creature124> well, im going to shut down the GUI and mess with xorg.conf now...seeya later!
[11:05] <morgue> erUSUL, I get Could not open CUE hlm-mvp5a.iso: No such file or director

[11:06] <LjL> rich_: depends on the program.

[11:06] <rich_> ive installed it and for some reason its giving me a syntax error
[11:06] <LjL> rich_: why didn't you install it from the repos in the first place?
[11:06] <rich_> wasn't aware it was there
[11:06] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell rich_ about packages
[11:07] <erUSUL> morgue: but do you have the corresponding .cue file??
[11:07] <Samus_Aran> morgue: two files.  one is the already-compiled binary (just stick it in your $PATH and chmod a+x it) and the other is the C source code
[11:07] <Samus_Aran> morgue: you can use one or the other
[11:07] <EdgeT> People, how do I mount a partition with writing access?
[11:07] <LjL> rich_, you could possibly use the "cruft" package to remove it, and hope it hasn't overwritten anything. next time use stuff from the repositories.
[11:07] <morgue> erUSUL, yes
[11:07] <EdgeT> I mean an external hdd
[11:07] <rich_> ok thank you

[11:09] <porkpie> Hi guy's can you tell me where I can ftp down ubuntu iso
[11:09] <LjL> leafw: i dunno, but i'd be surprised if DRI was supported over SSH...?
[11:09] <morgue> Samus_Aran, now how do i do the $path thing? :D
[11:09] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: can't we automate it?
[11:09] <leafw> LjL : should be
[11:09] <LjL> porkpie: www.ubuntu.com
[11:09] <porkpie> I want to use an ftp program
[11:09] <leafw> LjL : this error was not there in dapper.
[11:09] <morgue> erUSUL, I don't know heh, the file name is correct
[11:09] <LjL> porkpie: you're free to do that.
[11:09] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, if that works, then you can add a line to automate that in /etc/fstab
[11:09] <morgue> erUSUL, maybe the command is not right
[11:09] <porkpie> LjL:where are the iso
[11:10] <savvas> can someone please answer: where can i find an ubuntu desktop i386 jigdo file?
[11:10] <LjL> porkpie, i could click for you and find them, but can't you do that yourself?
[11:10] <leafw> plus, sometimes the X server gets locked up so bad, that can't even reach out to tty, one has to reboot the machine
[11:10] <erUSUL> savvas: download.ubuntu.com
[11:10] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: can we also do it by downloading the diskmounter script
[11:10] <Samus_Aran> morgue: do you want everyone on the computer to be able to run it by typing "bin2iso" in at the command line, or do you want to just run it from your home directory ?
[11:10] <LjL> porkpie, and i don't even know what flavor of ubuntu you want.
[11:10] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you can try... never tried that script
[11:10] <morgue> Samus_Aran, I'm the only user so I don't care, whatever it's easier :)
[11:11] <Samus_Aran> morgue: the easiest is: chmod a+rx bin2iso; sudo mv bin2iso /usr/bin
[11:11] <Samus_Aran> morgue: or else move it to /usr/local/bin
[11:11] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: yeah but if i end up with the same deal? how do i "give" myself the rights to write stuff to the hdd?
[11:11] <Samus_Aran> if that is in your program path
[11:12] <morgue> Samus_Aran, just move bin2iso into /usr/bin ?
[11:12] <savvas> erUSUL: no, ubuntu doesn't have a jigdo file for the desktop version
[11:12] <VigoFuse> root and user?
[11:12] <Samus_Aran> morgue: you also need to set it as executable ("execute" permissions for whoever will run it)
[11:12] <Samus_Aran> morgue: "chmod a+rx bin2iso" will do that, or in a file manager right-click > properties
[11:13] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you need the folder to be chmod 777 and the disk to be mounted rw. try doin stuff as root first.. what filesystem are you using?
[11:13] <morgue> Samus_Aran, via the gui says i can't copy to /bin
[11:13] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: it's an ntfs
[11:13] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, there's your problem
[11:13] <LjL> morgue, don't use /bin, use /usr/local/bin - and you need to be root
[11:13] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: used the script, that bastard mounted it in read only
[11:14] <pppoe_dude> !ntfs > EdgeT
[11:14] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: you shount write to ntfs
[11:14] <LjL> morgue, also, are you aware that there is a packaged tool for converting bin to iso?
[11:14] <LjL> !bchunk | morgue
[11:14] <ubotu> bchunk: CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.0-1 (edgy), package size 12 kB, installed size 68 kB
[11:14] <EdgeT> llvllatrix: ouch
[11:14] <EdgeT> Then wtf
[11:14] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: You'll probably end up wreaking the file system, because M$ wont release the spec.
[11:14] <l_r> hello
[11:14] <morgue> LjL, I tried that but it's not working
[11:15] <EdgeT> damit
[11:15] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, writing to ntfs is not recommended (unstable) and also not implemented by default in ubuntu
[11:15] <LjL> morgue: like what?
[11:15] <l_r> i wonder if it's suggested to upgrade 6.06 to 6.10
[11:15] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: People have tried, but I think its still unsafe.
[11:15] <porkpie> LjL:I cannot find the iso on ftp.ubuntu.com
[11:15] <EdgeT> can't i convert it?
[11:15] <morgue> it says, Could not open CUE hlm-mvp5a.iso: No such file or director
[11:15] <LjL> porkpie, i said www.ubuntu.com
[11:15] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: So then I mounted for ... nothing
[11:15] <LjL> porkpie, there are several mirrors, and some are FTP
[11:15] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: Not without reinstalling windows.
[11:15] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you can still read stuff...
[11:15] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, if u want to risk writing, then follow that link i gave
[11:15] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: You'll have to reinstall, use FAT32.
[11:15] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, and no you can't convert ntfs->ext3
[11:16] <SethPell> Does anyone know how to fix the following (I get it when trying to re-install the gtk2-engines package) E: gtk-engines-eazel: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2
[11:16] <morgue> Samus_Aran, so it's /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin ?
[11:16] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, might have luck converting it to fat32 in windows tho
[11:16] <creature124> question - I'm trying to get my printer setup, and i was wondering how to remove my blunders, these printer entries that dont work
[11:16] <morgue> what's the console command to copy?
[11:16] <llvllatrix> morgue: cp
[11:17] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: that's what i wanted to do
[11:17] <llvllatrix> morgue: for more details use $ man cp
[11:17] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Is Fat32 rw supported?
[11:17] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, yes
[11:17] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, and actually, if you want to risk rw ntfs, you need to google... that link wont do much
[11:17] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Is it stable too?
=== sorin is now known as SorinD
[11:18] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: you'll probably end up wreaking the disk
[11:18] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Nah, I won't risk it, I got like 100 gb's of stuff on that
[11:18] <creature124> question - I'm trying to get my printer setup, and i was wondering how to remove my blunders, these printer entries that dont work
[11:18] <morgue> Samus_Aran, ok I already copied it, now what?
[11:18] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, pretty much... its natively supported by the kernel
[11:18] <morgue> Samus_Aran, bin2iso is on /usr/bin
[11:19] <DanSchnell> If I'm running on an AMD64 Computer, do I NEED to download the 64 bit version of edgy?
[11:19] <pppoe_dude> dennis-, no
[11:19] <pppoe_dude> oops
[11:19] <pppoe_dude> DanSchnell, no
[11:19] <llvllatrix> creature124: There should be a little printer icon in the top right; you should be able to kill the entries there.
[11:19] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: So do I risk something?
[11:19] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you risk the conversion process
[11:19] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, but if it converted successfully you don't risk much...
[11:19] <LjL> SethPell: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/eazel-engine/+bug/68668 https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/eazel-engine/+bug/65031
[11:20] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Crap I hate M$
[11:20] <creature124> llvllatrix: the print JOBS yes, but i cant find a way to stop ubuntu thinking there is a printer there. that was what im after
[11:20] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, except i don't recommend keeping it fat32... there are major differences in fat32 and ext3
[11:20] <SethPell> thank you LjL
[11:20] <llvllatrix> creature124: I'm in Debian right now, but if I remember correctly, it should be in either your system prefs or settings.
[11:21] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, e.g. if you try to copy a bunch of files, you might have problems as the two filesystems have different naming rules, etc. (usually problems are when copying from fat32->ext3)
[11:21] <creature124> ok ill look around ty
[11:21] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Yeah but I wanted a fs that could be fully accessed by linux + w1nd0z3
[11:21] <Samus_Aran> morgue: "via the gui says i can't copy to /bin" this is because your user does not have permission to do so.  the command I gave you used the "sudo" command, which tells it to "run that command as the system administrator"
[11:21] <jmichaelx> does anyone know of an edgy repo that contains ralink wireless drivers (rt2xxx)?
[11:21] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, things like lower case / upper case filenames, etc...
[11:21] <morgue> Samus_Aran, I already copied
[11:21] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, fat32 is not case sensetive...
[11:21] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Crap
[11:21] <LjL> !find ralink | jmichaelx
[11:21] <ubotu> Package/file ralink does not exist in edgy
[11:22] <morgue> Samus_Aran, also I already runned sudo chmod a+rx bin2iso
[11:22] <Samus_Aran> morgue: "so it's /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin", /usr/local/bin is more appropriate for something like this, as it isn't from an Ubuntu package.  but I don't remember if Ubuntu has /usr/local/bin in its program search path or not by default
[11:22] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you won't damage anything, its might just be a pain in the butt
[11:22] <LjL> jmichaelx: well, no matter what the bot says, there are three packages that match
[11:22] <SethPell> LjL: Is there any way to work around the bug, or do I just have to wait for a fix from on high (I'm a linux noobie)
[11:22] <crimsun> /usr/local/bin is in the default $PATH
[11:22] <ricci> Hi guys!
[11:22] <LjL> SethPell: i'd wait for the fix.
[11:22] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: Ain't there a fs that could be rw by linux and w!nd0z3?
[11:23] <ricci> Someone can help me with twinview and projector?
[11:23] <jmichaelx> LjL: ok, i am looking for one for the 2.6.17.10 kernel... do you see one like that?
[11:23] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, ext3
[11:23] <penguinone_> ciao...
[11:23] <noelferreira> hi people
[11:23] <LjL> jmichaelx:  rt2400-source - RT2400 wireless network drivers source     rt2500-source - RT2500 wireless network drivers source     rt2570-source - RT2570 wireless network drivers source
[11:23] <LjL> jmichaelx: try packages.ubuntu.com also
[11:23] <LjL> !packages
[11:23] <ubotu> You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com  -  Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[11:23] <Samus_Aran> morgue: okay, just run: bin2iso myfile.cue mydir
[11:23] <Samus_Aran> morgue: fill in the filenames
[11:23] <jmichaelx> LjL: ty
[11:23] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you can mount ext3 filesystems on windows safely
[11:23] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: So there aren't Any probs with ext3 on both os?
[11:23] <noelferreira> my font size in with xgl and beryl stay too small how can i chang that?
[11:23] <creature124> I am having trouble setting up my HP photosmart 3210 printer. it dosent seem to auto detect, and that is causing my troubles...
[11:23] <Samus_Aran> morgue: it wants a folder name where it will put the ISO files
[11:23] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, no... coz fat32 -> ext3 is usually fine (ext3 is the more restrictive)
[11:24] <creature124> it is a USB printer - might be part of the problem
[11:24] <morgue> like this? $ bin2iso hlm-mvp5a.bin /hlm-mvp5a
[11:24] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: And how do I mount an ext3 partition really fast in w!nd0z3?
[11:24] <AngelU> hi
[11:24] <Samus_Aran> morgue: no, the cue file is what it wants listed.  and "/hlm-mvp5a" would be at the top of your hard drive with /usr and /dev.  try this: bin2iso hlm-mvp5a.cue hlm-mvp5a
[11:25] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, http://www.fs-driver.org/
[11:25] <AngelU> hi people
[11:25] <AngelU> i have problem
[11:25] <LjL> !ask
[11:25] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:25] <llvllatrix> creature124: Printers are usually anoying to get working. Did you find the printer's dialog I was talking about?
[11:25] <morgue> Samus_Aran, Unable to create hlm-mvp5a/hlm-mvp5a-01.iso
[11:26] <Samus_Aran> morgue: did it give a reason why ?
[11:26] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you need to download a small module to enable windows to recognize ext2/ext3
[11:26] <morgue> Samus_Aran, bin2iso(fopen): No such file or directory
[11:26] <LjL> !ext3
[11:26] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[11:26] <creature124> llvll: yes i did, and removed my failed attempt. the wiazrd for setting up a printer dosent detect it...what is the next step?
[11:26] <AngelU> i want to start some program automaticly with the ubuntu but the program should start like this ""nvclock -n 200"
[11:26] <Samus_Aran> morgue: oh, perhaps you need to create the empty folder first: mkdir hlm-mvp5a
[11:26] <llvllatrix> creature124: Here's what linuxprinting.org says: http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-PhotoSmart_3200
[11:26] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: cool thnx, I'll check that out
[11:26] <EdgeT> brb
[11:26] <creature124> tvm
[11:26] <LjL> AngelU: you can add it to /etc/rc.local probably, if it's not an X program
[11:26] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell AngelU about boot
[11:27] <Samus_Aran> morgue: did that work ?
[11:27] <morgue> Samus_Aran, I think so, yeah
[11:27] <morgue> Samus_Aran, says creating .iso
[11:27] <Samus_Aran> morgue: is it just one track ?
[11:27] <AngelU> thx people
[11:27] <AngelU> :D
[11:27] <phillip> does vmware take dvds?
[11:27] <Samus_Aran> phillip: yes
[11:27] <morgue> Samus_Aran, I guess so
[11:27] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: dude, but this is bout the ex2
[11:27] <Samus_Aran> phillip: if by "take" you mean "use"
[11:27] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: ext2*
[11:27] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, ext3 is just ext2 + journalling
[11:27] <llvllatrix> creature124: (just to be sure) Is the printer powered on?
[11:28] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: nvm sry
[11:28] <Samus_Aran> phillip: it can use DVDs on a physical drive (device in /dev), or through an ISO image file
[11:28] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, read the faq page
[11:28] <AngelU> brb
[11:28] <Jahman> hi

[11:28] <Samus_Aran> morgue: do you know what to do once it creates the ISO ?
[11:28] <kikokos> hi
[11:28] <com4> I just installed edgy on my system and when i use vlc to play a video file, it opens 4 windows. 1 of them looks normal, the other 3 say "xvideo output" and have no menus or controls
[11:28] <morgue> Samus_Aran, that's a tricky question lol
[11:29] <com4> how do i remedy this?
[11:29] <llvllatrix> creature124: If it is, try unplugging the usb cord and plugging it back in. Then go through the setup wizard again.
[11:29] <kikokos> LjL are u here ? :)
[11:29] <morgue> brb
[11:29] <LjL> kikokos: no
[11:29] <ianmacgregor> lol
[11:29] <Samus_Aran> morgue: if you want to run the setup, you will need to mount the image "loopback" (meaning it pretends that your file is a small hard drive)
[11:29] <kikokos> LjL uhmm
[11:30] <creature124> llvll: booya...that did it
[11:30] <kikokos> I have a problem with opening DVD could somebody tell me what s up?
[11:30] <Samus_Aran> morgue: for example: mkdir my_dvd; sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro,user,loop hlm-mvp5a/hlm-mvp5a-01.iso my_dvd
[11:30] <creature124> tyvm
[11:30] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, if you want to copy the whole partition onto another, see man dd
[11:30] <llvllatrix> creature124: np
[11:30] <creature124> this will make messing with xorg.conf so much easier
[11:30] <kikokos> I have edgy and I want to see one film :P
[11:31] <david__> i need help
[11:31] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: oki ty
[11:31] <pppoe_dude> kikokos, did you install the dvd libraries?
[11:31] <david__> i can't seem to run th ./configure on my termael
[11:31] <Samus_Aran> morgue: that will make the files show up in the "my_dvd" folder.  then if you wanted to try installing it in WINE, you would go to your ~/.wine/dosdevices/ folder and do this command: ln -s /home/whatever/my_dvd h:
[11:31] <kikokos> pppoe yes
[11:31] <david__> how can i change directery
[11:31] <Sl[a] sh> new linux user here. i just installed ubuntu, and when i restart the load bar doesnt move for an eternity, and then i get this: can't access tty; job control turned off
[11:31] <Samus_Aran> morgue: this is assuming WINE is already set up
[11:31] <Sl[a] sh> any help?

[11:32] <morgue> Samus_Aran, can we go step by step?
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> morgue: then you can run the SETUP.EXE or whatever it is called from the new H: drive, for example: cd "$HOME/.wine/dosdevices/h:/"; wine setup.exe
[11:32] <llvllatrix> Sl[a] sh: Can you get into your machine?
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> morgue: I just did =)
[11:32] <llvllatrix> Sl[a] sh: Do you login?
[11:32] <kikokos> TheGateKeeper Look at this http://forum.ubuntu.pl/viewtopic.php?t=16316 iI see it when I try open DvD
[11:32] <morgue> Samus_Aran, ok let me try lol, wine is already installed
[11:32] <Samus_Aran> morgue: but I have to leave now, so I was trying to give you all the main steps before I leave
[11:33] <pppoe_dude> kikokos, did you run /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh?
[11:33] <Sl[a] sh> no i cant get into my machine, and i dont get a login prompt
[11:33] <morgue> Samus_Aran, ok i'll sure miss you rofl
[11:33] <morgue> Samus_Aran, thank you!
[11:33] <Samus_Aran> morgue: I recommend copying and pasting the lines I wrote above so you have an idea of what you're doing.  if you need more help about WINE, check out the channel #WineHQ
[11:33] <kikokos> pppoe I think no , how I can run it?
[11:33] <Tschaka> hy mates i got the following problem: alsa seems to "allow" only one sound programm...so i cant play sounds with several programms at the same time...tried it with programms like xmms, mplayer, vlc and warsow, everytime the alsa driver was chosen but its wont play more then one of the sounds... any suggestions? :(
[11:33] <VigoFuse> Luck on the test Samus
[11:33] <pppoe_dude> kikokos, sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
[11:33] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: so can i convert ntfs to ext3 with np?
[11:33] <llvllatrix> Sl[a] sh: What happens the message?
[11:34] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, what's np? no problem?
[11:34] <Samus_Aran> morgue: good luck.  also, if the game doesn't work in WINE, it may work in Cedega, which is a commercial version of WINE specifically for games (it was a monthly subscription last time I looked to use the software)
[11:34] <pppoe_dude> :P
[11:34] <kikokos> pppoe something going on moment new library...
[11:34] <zorba64> EdgeT: yup...called reformatting :)
[11:34] <Samus_Aran> morgue: but if the game has copy protection, you will need to install it from a real DVD, not an ISO file
[11:34] <Samus_Aran> g'day all
[11:34] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude:  yeah:p
[11:35] <Sl[a] sh> llvllatrix: nothing happens exept it says (initramfs)
[11:35] <morgue> Samus_Aran, thanks i'll try
[11:35] <Sl[a] sh> and i can type stuff
[11:35] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you need to run gparted (easy way) or fdisk to repartition and reformat
[11:35] <llvllatrix> EdgeT: You're not going to be able to use that partition with windows if you convert to ext3
[11:35] <EdgeT> llvllatrix: got a link:)
[11:35] <pppoe_dude> !ex3> llvllatrix

[11:42] <pkh> Can someone recommend a good vpn-style encrypted proxy service that will work under ubuntu and also windows xp?
[11:42] <kuonSama> pkh a vpn style proxy?
[11:43] <yock> For anyone watching the tech news, there's a press conference occurring right now about the Microsoft/Novell partnership
[11:43] <yock> http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/bradsmith/default.mspx
[11:43] <yock> er
[11:43] <yock> http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/flash_stream.html
[11:43] <pkh> kuonSama, not sure what it's called.  a company that offers secure connection to their servers and all traffic is redirected from their out to the destination
[11:43] <yock> There
[11:43] <zorba64> savvas: desktop cd is a big squashfs filesystem, the other ones have the packages in directories so can be updates
[11:43] <savvas> zorba64: i also digged out the install/live dvd, is that the same as desktop version?
[11:43] <Spawn> Hello everyone.
[11:43] <kuonSama> pkh: you can use ssh or l2tp
[11:43] <pkh> kuonSama, their isp has issues when they log into password'd sites (asks for pasword every page refresh, different ip's, etc.)
[11:43] <zorba64> savvas: yep the live=desktop
[11:43] <savvas> cool!
=== gorded is now known as opixus
[11:44] <pkh> kuonSama, I've got enough work to do, wanted to pay for an external service rather than configure another server ourselves...
[11:44] <kuonSama> pkh: ssh is the simplest (you put a squid on the remote server, you ssh to it, and on your local machine, you set the local forwarded port as proxy)
[11:44] <duckdown> Is 'nmap localhost' the best way to ensure all my services are stopped/closed and nobody has anything malicious running on my machine?  And will it scan ALL my ports?
[11:45] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, as far as i know :P
[11:45] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: god damit nvm then grr
[11:45] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: hate shit
[11:45] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: hate this*
[11:45] <EdgeT> lol
[11:45] <kuonSama> pkh: you can create a vpn with l2tp (for individual computer) or with normal site to site vpn, and put a squid on the remote side
[11:45] <jaa6c6> ha
[11:45] <Agrajag> duckdown: netstat -nptul will tell you what port are in LISTEN mode
[11:45] <noelferreira> hi people. how can i put jre in amd64?
[11:45] <jaa6c6> thats quite a misstype
[11:45] <fignew> yock: that dude is full of crap
[11:45] <kuonSama> pkh: you can also do transparent proxy, but this is a bit complicated to explain it here
[11:46] <EdgeT> lol it is
[11:46] <Ych> !grub
[11:46] <EdgeT> well gtg ppl
[11:46] <kikokos> LjL so sad
[11:46] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[11:46] <EdgeT> cyas laters
[11:46] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT,
[11:46] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: thnks a lot dude:)
[11:46] <yock> fignew: only time will tell
[11:46] <jaa6c6> I am getting an error 17 when booting a raid 5 drive with grub, ne1 know a fix?
[11:46] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you can use dd to easily copy a partition
[11:46] <kuonSama> pkh: transparent proxy allow you to do no change to your clients, but it's quite hard to setup if you have no idea.
[11:46] <pkh> kuonSama, I've configured vpn before (many years) but we're absolutely run off our feet and I don't want to add to my workload if I can avoid it :)
[11:46] <fignew> if I understand, he's making it seem like running non-suse linux is illegal
[11:46] <kuonSama> pkh: proxy has nothing to do with vpn, you just tunnel the packet to the proxy
[11:47] <duckdown> Agrajag> thanks man
[11:47] <kuonSama> vpn is one part, proxy is the other
[11:47] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: yeah but that was my backup, i don't have any hdd that'd be big enough
[11:47] <yock> Well, Non-Suse Linux that has MS Proprietary technology would be illegal
[11:47] <Bizzy> ok, so, if i install ubuntu over 3 partitions /boot swap and / , as primary partitions 0 1 and 2, to take up 120 or so gb then have primary part 3 as another 120gb would i be able to run windows xp from that, if my bios doesnt like booting past 2gb ?
[11:47] <kuonSama> an other solution is to use a web based ssl proxy
[11:47] <LjL> kikokos, i haven't a clue
[11:47] <yock> That beings Mono under the microscope
[11:47] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, too bad then :P hope you figure it out
[11:47] <llvllatrix> yock: Violate the GPL, no?
[11:47] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, try tarring and gzipping the whole thing...
[11:47] <pkh> kuonSama, that might be sufficient -- was hoping for full vpn but simple web-based would probably solve our immediate problem
[11:47] <brynk> ok, my last attempt to get an epson aculaser c1100 printing in edgy, anyone?
[11:47] <kuonSama> you go to https://www.myproxy.com, then you type a webaddress, and the page is loaded by the remote site, encrypted and sent to you
[11:47] <Kyral> Actually....MS would be breaking the GPL
[11:48] <Kyral> the Linux Kernel is under the GPL no?
[11:48] <ephesius> does anyone know how to convert a flash video file to ogg or avi or something?
[11:48] <yock> llvllatrix: I don't know. If Mono violates .NET patents, then the GPL is null and void for Mono, since it wasn't their technology to license in the first place.
[11:48] <jaa6c6> I am getting an error 17 when booting a raid 5 drive with grub, ne1 know a fix?
[11:48] <kuonSama> pkh: I don't have name of software that can do that in mind, but it's an easy and working solution
[11:48] <llvllatrix> Kyral: I tink no
[11:48] <JosefK> yay :) anyone who fancies some decent eye-candy, install and add gnome-main-menu to your panel ^^
[11:48] <Kyral> and the GPL forbids linking with non-GPL complient things
[11:48] <llvllatrix>  Kyral: *I think so
[11:48] <kikokos> LjL :) if U don`t know nobody does
[11:49] <Bizzy> GPL is a very hypocritical licence
[11:49] <yock> Kyral: which we all violate by running Firefox anywayt
[11:49] <kuonSama> pkh: a simple php script that replace all url in the source page with something like https://www.myproxy.com/?get=http...
[11:49] <Kyral> yock: I run Konq :D
[11:49] <Bizzy> claims to be all about freedom, yet tells you what you can and cant do with your own source
[11:49] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: i'd need to lose 27gb to be able to copy it
=== king is now known as Alakazamz0r
[11:49] <yock> Kyral: Indeed, do you use Apache?
[11:49] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, you might
[11:49] <pkh> kuonSama, just went to myproxy.com --> got DongMun.org
[11:49] <pkh>  and nothing else...
[11:49] <Kyral> yock: The Apache License is GPL complient
[11:49] <Ych> can i just move around the bootloaders in the menu.lst of my GRUB to change the order, and change which boot is default?
[11:49] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, if theres a lot of movies and music then probably not, otherwise theres a good chance
[11:49] <yock> Is it? Since when?
[11:49] <kuonSama> pkh: www.myproxy.com was an example
[11:49] <bruenig> certain commands such as using sed (sed whatever file > newfile) won't work if I just put sudo at the beginning of the command (I assume because it not only does its normal editing of the file but then also writes the new file as the error says that I don't have permission to write the new file) If I use sudo su and then do the command it works fine. Is there anyway to make it work with sudo and not have to summon a root termin
[11:49] <bruenig> al?
[11:50] <pkh> kuonSama, sorry, just hit it directly :)
[11:50] <kuonSama> pkh: you must create that website, put it on a server, enable ssl ...
[11:50] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, gzip compressed 400mb of random files to about 200 once for me
[11:50] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: well i got quite a "lil" collection of music lol, 34gbs
[11:50] <Char_Aznable> hi
[11:50] <EdgeT> gb*
[11:50] <Bizzy> pppoe_dude: try lzma
[11:50] <yock> the GPL is too restrictive for real-world application, IMHO, but a lot of people love the idealism.
[11:50] <jaa6c6> GB?
[11:50] <jaa6c6> or gb? :)
[11:50] <LjL> kikokos, heh, it's not like i know everything there is to know about ubuntu - hardly even close :P
[11:50] <EdgeT> gb:p
[11:50] <Char_Aznable> can someone help me answer a question :D
[11:50] <boink> !ask
[11:50] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:51] <Char_Aznable> k :D
[11:51] <fignew> from osnews.com :" As part of the agreement, Microsoft also promises not to wield its patent portfolio against SUSE Linux."
[11:51] <fignew> thus telling me
[11:51] <llvllatrix> fignew: lol
[11:51] <Char_Aznable> how do i know if i installed the desktop version or the server version?
[11:51] <fignew> that running any other version of linux puts you at risk.
[11:51] <boink> does X start?
[11:51] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: nice but i got too much media for gzip to compress
[11:51] <Bizzy> no
[11:51] <Bizzy> what it says is
[11:51] <jaa6c6> Anyone know anything about getting grub to boot a raid 5 disk? I get an ERROR 17
[11:51] <Spawn> can someone help me out with the ati driver.  I have an x300 Mobility .. I installed the dirvers but it keeps giving me the mesa openGL
[11:51] <bruenig> Char_Aznable, do you have a desktop or do you just get a black and white command prompt?
[11:51] <kuonSama> pkh: so the solutions you got are: webpage ssl proxy (only http), ssh link or l2tp (need configuration on every single machine for vpn and proxy) to a server that will forward to a squid (you can proxy email, http...), you setup a site to site vpn, and put a proxy on the remote site or finaly, you setup a site to site vpn with transparent proxy
[11:51] <Kyral> hmm
[11:51] <Char_Aznable> desktop
[11:51] <bipolar> Bizzy: the GPL does not tell you what you can do with your own source. if it's your code, then you can do whatever you want with it. But if you give it to someone else under the GPL, you can't take it back from them. thats all.
[11:51] <ianmacgregor> The Microsoft/Novell stuff is off-topic for this Ubuntu support channel. can we take it elsewhere please?
[11:51] <bruenig> Char_Aznable, then desktop
[11:51] <yock> fignew: Running other versions of Linux that contain Microsoft patent violations, sure.
[11:51] <boink> desktop = ubuntu desktop
[11:51] <Char_Aznable> o
[11:52] <EdgeT> pppoe_dude: well thnks anyways dude, and cyas ppl:)
[11:52] <pppoe_dude> EdgeT, no prob
[11:52] <boink> the server version has no graphics
[11:52] <Char_Aznable> doh, i downloaded the wrong version..
[11:52] <fignew> yock: ms patents are so broad though
[11:52] <kalosaurusre1> anyone have any experience with pyqt?
[11:52] <pkh> kuonSama, thanks.  am going to have a good look around and see what suits us best.
[11:52] <kikokos> LjL maybe I shouldn`t touch my computer :P
[11:52] <drivera90> yaaay
[11:52] <yock> fignew: all patents are broad
[11:52] <kuonSama> pkh: on the long term, I think site to site vpn with a squid on the remote site is the best one, if you have a lot of machine (like a university) you can use transparent proxy
[11:52] <Kyral> http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndNonfreeOnSameMachine
[11:52] <Bizzy> bipolar: if i licence my code under GPL, then link it myself to non-gpl compat code... im violating my own code
[11:52] <Char_Aznable> thanks.
[11:52] <Kyral> I was wroing

[11:52] <aaron_> I'm having a problem with DVD playback in edgy.... Using Beta Nvidia drivers
[11:52] <Kyral> LINKING is different than running alongside
[11:52] <drivera90> :D
[11:52] <kuonSama> pkh: transparent proxy redirect the http packet, even if the browser is not configured with a proxy
[11:52] <bipolar> Bizzy: you can't distribute it, thats all
[11:52] <Bizzy> if i install ubuntu over 3 partitions /boot swap and / , as primary partitions 0 1 and 2, to take up 120 or so gb then have primary part 3 as another 120gb would i be able to run windows xp from that, if my bios doesnt like booting past 2gb ?
[11:53] <kuonSama> pkh: transparent proxy can be handy, but they are a pain to get right.
[11:53] <Bizzy> bipolar: so, its telling me what i can and cant do
[11:53] <Kyral> You CAN'T use GNU Readline in an application that isn't GPL-Complient
[11:53] <pkh> kuonSama, no, quite the oposite -- one person in S.A. and no-one else with any problems...
[11:53] <fredo> joins #ubuntu-fr
[11:53] <bipolar> Bizzy: no, it's telling you what you can't do with someone elses code.

[11:54] <Char_Aznable> o 1 more thing, is the setup disc the same for server/desktop?
[11:54] <Trent__> Gimme some help over here
[11:54] <kuonSama> Kyral: and I missread
[11:54] <bipolar> Kyral: his thoughts are a common misconception
[11:54] <Kyral> Indeed
[11:54] <Bizzy> Kyral: and as an active open source developer who thinks the GPL is a total load of hypocritical bullshit, as are you :P
[11:55] <Trent__> Anyone know how I can get the files from my Windows partition over to my Ubuntu???
[11:55] <Kyral> ....
[11:55] <Kyral> someone kick him
[11:55] <kuonSama> Trent__: ntfs or fa?
[11:55] <bipolar> Bizzy: thats uncalled for
[11:55] <Trent__>  About 9 GB btw
[11:55] <kuonSama> *fat
[11:55] <Trent__> kuonSama: NTFS
[11:55] <kuonSama> Trent__: to read ntfs no problem
[11:55] <Kyral> (And not for calling the GPL a load of hypcritical BS, but for calling me one)
[11:55] <kuonSama> Trent__: to write ntfs, support is still beta, and you need fuse tools
[11:55] <Bizzy> bipolar: am i not alowd to voice my own opinion?
[11:55] <kuonSama> Trent__: do you need to write?
[11:55] <Trent__> kuonSama: great... so how do I get it done?
[11:55] <demo45> hola
[11:55] <kikokos> trent u dont see your win partition?
[11:55] <Kyral> Bizzy: Attacking someone personally, no way
[11:55] <bipolar> Bizzy: sure. but don't insult people
[11:55] <Bizzy> no, i said your in for a flamewar

[11:56] <kikokos> trent as hda1
[11:56] <Trent__> kikokos: no I don't... am I supposed to?
[11:56] <Bizzy> i guess i worded what i wrote, wrongly
[11:56] <jaa6c6> Anyone know anything about getting grub to boot a raid 5 disk? I get an ERROR 17 :(
[11:56] <kuonSama> Trent__: ok simply do mount /dev/yourdevice /mnt
[11:56] <bruenig> voice your own opinions? what do you think this is? a liberal democracy?
[11:56] <kuonSama> Trent__: but ubuntu should mount it automaticaly to /media
[11:56] <Kyral> You can voice your opinions
[11:56] <ianmacgregor> Offtopic chat needs to go to another channel. This is an Ubuntu support channel.

[11:56] <Kyral> Just don't attack users personally

[11:58] <maxflax> kuonSama, the doc blows.. I've read it. it says nothing.. crap is it
[11:58] <bipolar> Bizzy: if you want anyone to do anything with your code without requireing them to give back to the project in any way then that licence is fine. It's your choice. But when I write software I don't want that, so I use the GPL. Calling the GPL hypocritical becouse it won't let you use MY code in YOUR Bsd/Mit licenced project is not fair.
