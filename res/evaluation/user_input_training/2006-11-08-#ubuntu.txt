[12:01] <bruenig> ruzgar, why do you wish to backup the packages list?
[12:01] <ey> ifireball what command allowes me to close a message from another user on my server?
[12:01] <ey> :)
[12:01] <sethk> aztun, but perhaps you are more familiar with it than I am.  (although mine works)
[12:01] <ruzgar> when i reinstall ubuntu
[12:01] <aztun> maybe sethk
[12:01] <ruzgar> i want to install al packages automotic
[12:01] <aztun> root@lepetika:~# cat /etc/sysctl.conf | grep forw
[12:01] <aztun> # Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4
[12:01] <aztun> net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding=1
[12:01] <kapten> a swedish guy!
[12:02] <ifireball> ey: since it doesn't "open" there isn't a command to close it, you jsut press enter if if confuses you
[12:02] <bruenig> ruzgar, so do you mean the packages you have installed?
[12:02] <ey> ifireball i am learning about unix :S so i need help .how do i close on a another user
[12:02] <ruzgar> yes bruenig
[12:02] <ey> ifireball i mean i dont want his message .but i wanna stay longer on my chatt
[12:02] <ey> ifireball i just wanna block him
[12:03] <nasragiel> where can i save a command that it is executed before xorg starts?
[12:03] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> when i start my webcam with video0 or video1 or with camstream xubuntu crashes. can someon help me?
[12:03] <bruenig> ruzgar, all the packages you have downloaded and installed are likely to be in /var/cache/apt/archives
[12:03] <ruzgar> umm ok
[12:03] <ruzgar> tx
[12:03] <asdf_> AlReece45: Yes, but it does not detect my wireless
[12:03] <sethk> nasragiel, you mean you want it to execute whether X starts or not, or you want to execute it when X starts up?
[12:04] <ifireball> ey: you use the mesg vommand; e.g. "mesg n" to blocl all messages to your terminal
[12:04] <nasragiel> wheter x starts or not, i have to use 915resolution, maybe you know this tool
[12:04] <aztun> cant find how to see if packet_forwarding is active on /proc/net
[12:04] <cryptonic> has anyone here successfully installed wengophone 2 on ubuntu?
[12:04] <crimsun> 915resolution has its own initscript, nasragiel.
[12:04] <razorhack> Hello everybody! I've jbeen trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on my dell 640M laptop. But the liveCD won't even start.  I get a an xserver error and then everything stops after fck --> (ok) message. I am stumped :)
[12:05] <crimsun> nasragiel: in edgy that script is run prior to any desktop manager being invoked (which starts X)
[12:05] <bruenig> ruzgar, there is not some central list, you can make a list and then do some editing to make it easier to automate an install later
[12:05] <asdf_> AlReece45: do you know where the config setitngs are for network-manager
[12:05] <sethk> nasragiel, probably /etc/rc.local
[12:05] <ruzgar> ok
[12:05] <nasragiel> seth_|, thanks
[12:06] <CurleySue> anyone can help with exiting fluxbox?
[12:06] <nasragiel> crimsun, i found it, but it does not start obviosly, how can i make it starting on boot?
[12:06] <sethk> nasragiel, someone said it has an init script though.  If it does, then that script simply needs to be linked to the run level directory.  perhaps the script isn't using the options you want.
[12:06] <aztun> root@lepetika:~# sysctl -q net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding
[12:06] <aztun> net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding = 1
[12:06] <ifireball> CurleySue: ctrl+alt+backspace will most certaily exit it... (although rather violently)
[12:06] <aztun> root@lepetika:~# sysctl -q net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding
[12:06] <aztun> net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding = 1
[12:06] <aztun> what a shit
[12:06] <aztun> packet forwarding is active
[12:06] <ey> ifireball thanks
[12:06] <aztun> but doesnt work
[12:07] <ifireball> aztun: make sure iptable isn't blocking your traffic
[12:07] <nasragiel> sethk, it is, ive checked it already
[12:07] <sethk> aztun, run the route command (with no arguments), and put the output on the paste bot
[12:07] <nasragiel> but i dont know how to add it to a runlevel
[12:07] <AlReece45> asdf_: too unfortunate. I'm not 100% sure, but /etc/network/interfaces might be the file that network-manager uses
[12:07] <CurleySue> ifireball: thanx, but I'm looking for a clean way... there's an exit FB command which I'd like to imitate in a bash script
[12:08] <cryptonic> is there a logs section to terminal?
[12:08] <ey> ifireball can i send to 3 ppl a message with just one text ,you know like this "write jeimz hi" but can i send with 1 command to 3 ppl
[12:08] <AlReece45> asdf_: note that's a file, its not in gconf
[12:08] <sethk> nasragiel, oh, you go to the directory for the run level, as in /etc/rc1.d, then you do:  ln -s /etc/init.d/scriptname
[12:08] <ey> ifireball please tell me if you dont understand me :(
[12:08] <nasragiel> ok, thank you! :)
[12:08] <sethk> nasragiel, that will make a link, named "scriptname" (which you change of course to the real name), in /etc/rc1.c
[12:08] <ey> ifireball my english is sick :<
[12:08] <aztun> how can I paste?
[12:08] <asdf_> AlReece45: I think that did it...I'm going to chekc
[12:08] <asdf_> thank you
[12:08] <sethk> nasragiel, rc1.d assuming you want runlevel 1.  you may want to put in more than one run level.
[12:09] <ifireball> ey: there is the wall command that send a mesasge to all users in the system, other then that you haev to use a script
[12:09] <sethk> aztun, you mean, how to use the paste web site, or how to get the stuff copied within linux?
[12:09] <sethk> !paste
[12:09] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:09] <sethk> aztun, paste, just in case.  :)
[12:09] <cheesy> how can i execute a *.bin file?
[12:10] <sethk> cheesy, file names in linux have no significance.  the fact that it is .bin doesn't tell you how to run it.  Probably you can do:   chmod +x whatever.bin, then do ./whatever.bin
[12:10] <aztun> ok
[12:10] <aztun> pasted on the web
[12:10] <ey> ifireball cant i use like this " write jeimz hello; write eko hello; write jack hello
[12:10] <rstanca> any tips on why acpi is not workin? default edgy install, worked with dapper, the error when starting acpid "No ACPI support in kernel, or incorrect acpi_path ("/proc/acpi")"
[12:10] <ey> ifireball cant it work?
[12:11] <sethk> aztun, ok, then paste the url here
[12:11] <ifireball> ey: no becasue write needs the input from the standatrd input channel, it can't read the message from the command line
[12:11] <aztun> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30555/
[12:11] <rstanca> sorry, thats for acpi, for acpid: acpid: can't open /proc/acpi/event: No such file or directory"
[12:11] <ifireball> ey: you can use echo "msg" | write user1; echo "msg" | write user2; ...
[12:12] <aztun> and this is config on my client machine
[12:12] <aztun> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30556/
[12:12] <angel_of_shadow> mode graphique ^^
[12:13] <sethk> aztun, that's the output of iptables.  I asked you for the output of route
[12:13] <aztun> on my server??
[12:13] <cheesy> thanks sethk
[12:13] <aztun> I have inet on my server
[12:13] <tarelerulz> I can't change my monitor from 640x680 and I have done auto detect and try to set it higher ,but x just get some error and then I have to set it back to what it was
[12:13] <sethk> aztun, wait, which paste is which?
[12:13] <bruenig> !xcfg
[12:13] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[12:13] <aztun> first one is iptables on my server
[12:13] <sethk> aztun, the second is route.
[12:13] <sethk> aztun, on the same server?
[12:13] <aztun> second one is route on my client
[12:13] <aztun> no
[12:13] <sethk> aztun, we need route on the server
[12:13] <aztun> different machines
[12:14] <aztun> I have inet on server
[12:14] <The_Belgain> hi there, quick question: how can a run a scandisk on a drive in ubuntu?  i'm not talking about checking the filesystem is good (I know it isn't), I want to check whether the drive is working (the equivalent of a surface scan in windows)?
[12:14] <sethk> tarelerulz, possibly your monitor isn't being automatically detected.  or your settings are incorrect for your video card, and it is defaulting to that resolution.   run   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:15] <aztun> route on my server
[12:15] <aztun> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30557/
[12:15] <sethk> aztun, ok, let me look
[12:15] <||thunder> The_Belgain;  I looked for that once, gave up cuz I couldn't find it.
[12:15] <thalm> salute
[12:15] <aztun> I can ping 81.202.160.1 from the server but no from client
[12:15] <sethk> aztun, ok.  try running traceroute from your client.
[12:16] <sethk> aztun, try running traceroute (on the client) to 81.202.160.1
[12:16] <tarelerulz> other then not being about to change from 640X480 to anything high my screen works fine
[12:16] <sethk> aztun, the first hop should be the server.  see if you see any additional info after the first hop
[12:16] <sethk> tarelerulz, that's why I suggested you reconfigure your video
[12:16] <aztun> ups
[12:16] <sethk> tarelerulz, but if you are happy with 640x480 ... :)
[12:16] <aztun> have no traceroute installed on client, and no inet
[12:17] <thalm> i cant hear web radio with amarok, can so give me an hint? mp3/wav playback works
[12:17] <sethk> aztun, are you sure?  if it's a windows box, most of them do have traceroute, but named something like tracert
[12:17] <The_Belgain> so no ideas on how to run a scan?  i'm actually trying to verify whether my SATA controller is faulty....
[12:17] <aztun> I dont use windows
[12:17] <sethk> aztun, then put traceroute onto your client
[12:17] <tarelerulz> it works ,but I don't like the fact I can't change it. I have to move stuff around to see the bottom of some windows. That is lame
[12:17] <mcphail> The_Belgain: not sure about the scan, but check dmesg for errors
[12:18] <sethk> aztun, if it isn't windows, you can just copy it over there from your server (assuming they are the same processor family and running the same o/s)
[12:18] <aztun> ok
[12:18] <aztun> I will copy it
[12:18] <||thunder> aztun; don't know.  let me try.
[12:18] <||thunder> HEY. how do I scandisk a drive or part ?
[12:18] <SirKillalot> anyone here who uses a DLink Wifi Card?
[12:18] <sethk> The_Belgain, try badblocks
[12:18] <thalm> i cant hear web radio with amarok, can so give me an hint? mp3/wav playback works
[12:18] <Curley_Sue> any one knows how to set a logout script for fluxbox
[12:18] <qatsi> any idea why could i get "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"." when running glxgears ?
[12:19] <Acc\Deny> Hi, My question concerns the Alternate Install CD. While Installing in text mode, the screen went blank...last message seen was "Configuring xorg...". How do I stop it from configuring xorg? my board is 845 and i believe i have to first install the 915resolution package...   plus can I select which packages to skip at first install?
[12:19] <The_Belgain> i get the following errors in dmesg, and the drive gets kicked from my RAID array: [17179575.312000]  hde: set_geometry_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady
[12:19] <The_Belgain> SeekComplete Error }
[12:19] <The_Belgain> [17179575.312000]  hde: set_geometry_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
[12:19] <sethk> Curley_Sue, I don't know, but, you can always wrap the fluxbox startup command into a script, and then put whatever commands you want to run at the end of the script
[12:19] <jadacyrus> I have a question, how came Nvidia Drivers break when you install linux-restricted-modules ?!??
[12:19] <maxflax> The_Belgain, use a sledgehammer
[12:19] <jadacyrus> I
[12:19] <sethk> The_Belgain, those are log messages?  from running what program?
[12:19] <aztun> aztun@esplinter:~$ traceroute 81.202.160.1
[12:19] <aztun> traceroute: icmp socket: Operation not permitted
[12:19] <aztun> wtf?
[12:20] <Infecto> OpenGL version string: 2.0.6119 (8.30.3)
[12:20] <The_Belgain> those are from dmesg
[12:20] <sethk> aztun, might need to run with root privileges
[12:20] <jadacyrus> I'm pretty sure I need the linux-restricted-modules to get some of my devices working such as my webcam
[12:20] <Infecto> sry not here
[12:20] <sethk> aztun, or icmp may be blocked.  it's often blocked for security reasons.
[12:20] <qatsi> any idea why could i get "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"." when running glxgears ? (finally using xinerama)
[12:20] <maxflax> jadacyrus, what are stopping u then
[12:20] <jadacyrus> if you read above i said, when you install linux-restricted-modules is breaks nvidia driver
[12:20] <The_Belgain> more info at this link (in particular the third post): http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116274603600002&r=1&w=2
[12:21] <jadacyrus> im on edgy w/ nvidia 9625 beta btw
[12:21] <sethk> qatsi, either kernel support for DRI isn't enabled, or DRI isn't included in xorg.conf as an extension to be loaded
[12:21] <jadacyrus> If I use the nvidia-glx drivers from the repo's...can I have the restricted modules installed?
[12:21] <aztun> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30559/
[12:21] <aztun> ???
[12:22] <qatsi> sethk: it was doing fine till I edited the xorg.conf to work with xinerama....but the xorg.conf looks the same :s
[12:22] <maxflax> jadacyrus, sounds strange..
[12:22] <rstanca> any tips on why acpi is not workin? default edgy install, worked with dapper, the error when starting acpi "No ACPI support in kernel, or incorrect acpi_path ("/proc/acpi")"
[12:22] <sethk> qatsi, look in your X log.  see if it tries to load DRI, see if there were any warnings
[12:22] <daschl> rstanca: what system do you use?
[12:23] <icesmurf> heyas, anyone know why the squid packages in edgy are now compiled without transproxy support?
[12:23] <jadacyrus> maxflax: on the howto i was reading for edgy + nvidia beta + aiglx, it states that you can't ahve the restricted modules installed with the beta driver
[12:23] <sun_> hi anyone know the name of the package which installs all the standard x-clients like xset, xterm, xmodmap etc?
[12:23] <rstanca> daschl: system?
[12:23] <sisqonrwwwwwwww> hi i get a report. after xawtv -c /dev/video    ....no overlay support. what can i do?
[12:23] <Curley_Sue> sethk: can u explain some more?
[12:23] <daschl> rstanca: your computer :)
[12:24] <sethk> Curley_Sue, I don't even remember what we were talking about.  :)
[12:24] <rstanca> daschl: some old matsonic motherboard with sis chipset
[12:24] <cheesy> is there someone who could help me installing aptana?
[12:24] <cheesy> just didn't get it
[12:24] <sethk> Curley_Sue, remind me
[12:24] <rstanca> daschl: no problem in dapper or any other distro :(
[12:24] <maxflax> jadacyrus, what do u need from the restricted then.. can't u compile those modules yourself`?
[12:24] <qatsi> sethk: it does load dri....unless it unloads it after that, i dont know whats up :S
[12:25] <aztun> dont understand
[12:25] <lllloo> hello peeps anyone know any places were i can find info on getting Audigy 4 cards to work properly?
[12:25] <sethk> qatsi, I don't think it can unload it, and even if it can, it would show up in the log.  Hmm...
[12:25] <aztun> I have done this with many different distros
[12:25] <aztun> in five minuts
[12:25] <aztun> and cant get it working on edgy
[12:25] <The_Belgain> so no hard drive scan suggestions :( ?
[12:25] <daschl> rstanca: hmm i can't locate your problem exactly, but maybe the kernel has changes slightly and so the ubuntu-acpi for your chipset is not working right.. wait a minute ill check the launchpad for bugs
[12:26] <slew> hi, is there an updated page for printing under edgy?
[12:26] <sethk> aztun, any particular reason why you need to be using edgy?  It's a very new release, has glitches here and there
[12:26] <qatsi> sethk: it says: Xinerama extension enabled, disabling direct rendering -- NoDRI = YES  ....could i prevent xinerama from disabling those ?
[12:26] <bcnl> anyone know a way to get HTTPFS to work with LUFS?
[12:26] <bcnl> there's no module for it
[12:26] <sethk> qatsi, hmm., I'm not sure.
[12:26] <ozubu> hi all
[12:26] <sethk> qatsi, do you have dri loading before, or after, xinerama in the config file?
[12:27] <aztun> yes sethk, I think I will stay on debian, dapper or mandriva
[12:27] <sethk> aztun, wait a couple of weeks, let edgy settle down
[12:27] <cheesy> can someone help me installing aptana please?
[12:27] <aztun> I think I will use debian
[12:27] <cheesy> i'm on edgy
[12:27] <ozubu> I have a question about Edgy Eft: How do I view the services starting during boot process (this was the default in Dapper) ?
[12:28] <aztun> well, at least I kept my previous installation on the other hd
[12:28] <aztun> so lets reboot
[12:28] <qatsi> sethk: as default...its before...but after the xinerama load, i have Section "DRI" Mode	0666 EndSection Section "Extensions" Option "Composite" "false" EndSection which i really dont know what they do....
[12:28] <aztun> many thanks for your help sethk
[12:28] <Curley_Sue> sethk: thanx... I am trying to create a logout script for exiting FB...
[12:28] <sun_> hi anyone know the name of the package which installs all the standard x-clients like xset, xterm, xmodmap etc?
[12:29] <ifireball> sun_: answer in question's body...
[12:29] <Pelo> ozubu, , system > admin > session
[12:29] <sethk> Curley_Sue, oh, yes.  there is a command to start fluxbox.  I'm not sure exactly what it is called.  there's, for example, a script startkde which is used to start kde.  there will be something similar for fluxbox.  You can edit that script, and add commands at the end.
[12:29] <cheesy> grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:29] <cheesy> What can i do?
[12:29] <Pelo> sun_,  just search synaptic for those terms
[12:30] <aztun> bye and thx again
[12:30] <ozubu> Pelo, this will show everything starting like in dapper ?
[12:30] <sethk> Curley_Sue, or, rename the script.  I'll give you the kde example so I can use real names.  I might rename startkde to really-startkde, then create a script startkde; the first line of my new script is really-startkde, and then the rest of my new script is whatever you need to run after fluxbox exits.
[12:30] <qatsi> sethk: ok, i loaded dri after xinerama...ill see how it works....brb :)
[12:30] <sun_> whats the simplest image viewer, like xv?
[12:30] <sethk> qatsi, I think it will probably do the same thing, but it's easy to try, so why not.
[12:30] <Pelo> ozubu,  have a look , that is where you get the progs that load at startup,  but probably not the various essentials services
[12:30] <icesmurf> anyone familiar with the squid builds on edgy?
[12:31] <wastrel> sun_:  imagemagick is good   % display image.png
[12:31] <Pelo> ozubu,  appologies , system > preferences > session
[12:31] <ozubu> Pelo, I want to see them loading - this edgy is very much like WINXP i just see a brown bar of progress - I want to see what is loading and what isn't
[12:32] <scapor> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30560/ -> my dpkg is fucked up;  really fucked up I'm affraid of.   Anyone knows of a solution to this ?
[12:32] <ozubu> Pelo: I am sorry If I am not understood but this is very frustrating
[12:32] <Pelo> ozubu,  oh, you want a screen like in dapper ...,  sorry , don'T know
[12:32] <ozubu> Pelo, well thank
[12:33] <Pelo> ozubu,  maybe in splash screen
[12:33] <sethk> scapor, I don't understand the messages.  what is it saying about /var/lib/dpkg/available?
[12:33] <beavis> can someone tell me where is the idea pool for  Feisty Fawn?
[12:33] <ozubu> Pelo: thank's anyway. But doesn't it disturb you ? Splash screen is for gnome splash
[12:33] <charle97> ozubu, edit grub
[12:33] <markelhas> any one can help me out with system settings missing tools?
[12:33] <Curley_Sue> sethk: what do u think I need to run after killing the WM (in order to be back and the login screen)?
[12:33] <icesmurf> ozubu:  yes you can if you want, change the entries in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[12:33] <markelhas> in my system settings can't find power management
[12:33] <Pelo> ozubu,  I'm pretty much of a noob,  as long as it works I am happy
[12:33] <icesmurf> remove the "splash" keyword.
[12:33] <markelhas> but when a go to console mode i can us acpi to see info of my battery laptop info
[12:34] <icesmurf> eg: kernel      /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=UUID=49c5b2cd-14ad-4444-8381-9a4e9a1f56ee ro vga=771 quiet splash
[12:34] <ozubu> charle97: what is it I am supposed to write in grub ?
[12:34] <icesmurf> eg: kernel      /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-386 root=UUID=49c5b2cd-14ad-4444-8381-9a4e9a1f56ee ro vga=771 quiet
[12:34] <markelhas> but when a go to console mode i can us acpi to see info of my battery laptop info
[12:34] <sethk> Curley_Sue, do you mean that you choose fluxbox as the session, log in, log out, and don't get back to the login screen?
[12:34] <qatsi> sethk: no luck :(....im loading ALL the modules after xinerama, but i dont think it will work :(
[12:34] <markelhas> i'm using kubuntu
[12:34] <sethk> qatsi, probably not, but it was worth a try.
[12:34] <slew> i cant get the lexmark z611 to work using the howto found on the ubuntu wiki. anyone have a suggestion that works?
[12:34] <Pelo> markelhas,  try #kubuntu
[12:34] <ozubu> icesmurf: do you know what's the missing line in grub ?
[12:34] <Pelo> slew,  this is a printer ?

[12:35] <ClayG> I need some help guys, I switched from GDM to XDM on my "server", I connect to it from old laptops to use it's power, sort of like a thinclient/server
[12:35] <ClayG> I need to know how i can fix the xdm settings from the CLI
[12:35] <slew> Pelo, that dosent work, i tried.
[12:36] <sethk> ClayG, /etc/X11/xdm has config files
[12:36] <ozubu> icesmurf: can you please direct me a little bit ?
[12:36] <ClayG> ok, sethk does that work if i removed xdm and am using gdm now?
[12:36] <sethk> ClayG, but gdm only handles incoming connections.  It has no effect at all on the performance of the laptops once they are connected.
[12:36] <ifireball> ClayG: no reason to use XDM for that GDM can do everthing XDM can and its easyer to configure
[12:36] <sethk> ClayG, some versions of gdm use xdm config files, but others don't.  I'm not sure which you have.
[12:36] <ozubu> icesmurf: I am trying to compare the edgy and dapper menu.lst (I have them both installed)
[12:37] <sethk> ClayG, my point is you gain nothing, performance wise, by replacing gdm with xdm

[12:37] <ozubu> icesmurf: what and where should I add ?
[12:38] <icesmurf> you dont add.. you remove.
[12:38] <sethk> ClayG, that may not have been a great idea, although I don't think it will remove xdm if gdm needs it.
[12:38] <icesmurf> have a look at the file
[12:38] <lk11mn> seth, i'm not the praying type!
[12:38] <sethk> ClayG, as long as you didn't use any force flags.
[12:38] <icesmurf> if you cant work it out, you should probably not be fiddling with it :-)
[12:38] <sethk> lk11mn, you have a backup of the ntfs partition, I hope
[12:38] <slew> so no one has a link to a page that explains how to install the lexmark printer and have it work?
[12:39] <lk11mn> not the praying, nor the backup type sethk

[12:41] <Trunkz> Can anyone tell me where I can download the prebuilt (.deb) ndiswrapper-utils package for breezy?
[12:41] <sethk> lk11mn, good luck.  obviously you had the raid drivers installed before, so it's just a matter of telling the recovery console thing to load them, which shouldn't be too hard.
[12:41] <Trunkz> Appreciate it =/

[12:58] <sethk> qubix__, obviously, xlib will find fewer packages, but might not find them all
[12:58] <gyaresu> wiz, you will need to specify your own res etc.
[12:58] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu. You might be out of luck if there isn't a linux equivalent. Wireless is one of the places I don't mess around with on hardware -- I always stick with atheros based cards.
[12:58] <foomanchew> anyone ? rythmbox issues ?
[12:58] <sethk> qubix__, try xlib space -dev first, if installing those doesn't get it, you can try X -dev
[12:58] <ey> what command is it agein to upgrade
[12:59] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: However, your card manufacturer should have drivers available on their website.
[12:59] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie:  can I pm you?
[12:59] <gyaresu> ey, 'sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade'
[12:59] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> If you don't mind
[12:59] <sethk> scapor, let me search for packages that start with libgnome2-vfs
[12:59] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> so I can tell the cards I have and which one I should get the driver for
[01:00] <scapor> sethk: -perl that is ? no ?
[01:00] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Feel free. I'm here to help whilst waiting to be helped. :)
[01:00] <sethk> scapor, could be, let me check
[01:00] <wiz> gyaresu, I have twinview setup, I want to setup xinerama extension support... assuming gnome has those features like kde does?
[01:00] <scapor> sethk: libgnome2-vfs-perl exists
[01:00] <sethk> scapor, yes, I see it also
[01:00] <MrFatJack> cwillu: Thanks - metacity got me operational.
[01:00] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie:  there lol
[01:00] <Curley_Sue> sethk: thanx for all the help. night!
[01:00] <sethk> scapor, I have the latest version as 1.022-1
[01:00] <cwillu> MrFatJack: np
[01:00] <cwillu> MrFatJack: wanna help me now?  :)
[01:00] <sethk> scapor, but I'm not on the most recent release, so that could be old.
[01:00] <gyaresu> wiz, should be compiled into all the progs already.
[01:01] <scapor> sethk: feisty that is ?
[01:01] <sethk> scapor, doesn't matter though, if it is, apt-get update will bring it up to date
[01:01] <clash> .
[01:01] <scapor> nvm
[01:01] <sethk> scapor, not quite that old  :)
[01:01] <scapor> apt-get doesn't work here anyway
[01:01] <sethk> scapor, it will once you fix this problem
[01:01] <scapor> sethk: yeah, I figured that out
[01:01] <sethk> scapor, apt-get and dpkg are the part of the same system
[01:02] <sethk> scapor, so if you get rid of the syntax error, apt-get update should work for you.  assuming, of course, that there aren't other problems in the file.
[01:02] <wiz> gyaresu, where do I find the options? Like having a seperate background image on seperate displays, and making windows only open on head 1?
[01:02] <scapor> sethk: I know, I'm used to debian for 5 years or more, I switched to ubuntu like 2 years ago when it came  up ;)
[01:02] <gyaresu> wiz, Are you getting windows open across both screens?
[01:02] <scapor> sethk: I didn't know of this file yet though .. never had this kind of problem... I tried deleting it with a backup stored so maybe the db would be recreated again
[01:03] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie: receive my pm?
[01:03] <scapor> sethk: though, no luck :)
[01:03] <emo_> how shall I find all the cookies in my system and how can I get rid of them ?
[01:03] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu. Yes. I'm replying in it.
[01:03] <emo_> how shall I find all the cookies in my system and how can I get rid of them ?
[01:03] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> k
[01:03] <wiz> gyaresu, no... but they open on head 2 a lot when there's other stuff open on 1, and that bothers me
[01:03] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I don't see your pm
[01:03] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> You need to register to send pms baxter
[01:03] <wiz> gyaresu, and I'd like the desktop background option
[01:03] <thor> emo_ just tell firefox to delete all the cookies on closing
[01:04] <scapor> sethk: I'm missing the gnome-vfs2-perl package information in that file right now.  Should it be there ? should all packages on the host be listed there ?
[01:04] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie: you need to register to pm on freenode
[01:04] <Trunkz> Gah

[01:04] <killown> how I swtich gnome to kde in ubuntu?
[01:04] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I'm fairly certain I'm registered. You have to be registered to even get on this chan.
[01:04] <emo_> thor: I mean through the terminal
[01:04] <Trunkz> Can someone just send me the prepackaged .deb for breezy?
[01:04] <Trunkz> Please? =/
[01:04] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie I'm not receiving your pm =/
[01:05] <georgy> killown, : login screen session kde
[01:05] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxter_kylie just tell me which one. 1 or 2
[01:05] <gyaresu> wiz, Desktop I can only tell you from kde or fluxbox (i don't use gnome). But the windows to specific windows can be done with prefacing the prog from the command line with an X command. I just can't remember what it is :(
[01:05] <killown> georgy, what?
[01:05] <killown> ahhh
[01:05] <killown> ok
[01:05] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: Number 2. But you should go to dell to get the driver.
[01:05] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lol  Im getting as we speak
[01:05] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> baxtor_kylie: I hope I can get it working >.<;
[01:06] <dusk> is there a better calc than gnucalc?
[01:06] <sethk> scapor, yes, if it's installed, it should be in the file
[01:06] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I tend to not play around with wireless. I honestly recommend you scrap the card and get an atheros based one. MadWifi is maddeningly cool.
[01:06] <gyaresu> dusk python
[01:06] <ZirJoker> why vlc player hides itself sometimes? i cant bring it up again
[01:06] <wiz> gyaresu, so I take it the xinerama support in gnome is less than desireable?
[01:06] <sethk> scapor, you can probably fix it up by doing an install of it.  It will install over itself, not knowing that it's already there.  You may need a force flag to tell it to overwrite the files that are already there
[01:06] <sethk> scapor, better if you can find someone else with a line for that package in their file, and put it into yours'
[01:06] <dusk> gyaresu: gui calc :)
[01:07] <scapor> sethk: I did that, it wanted to uinstall after removeing the sectionb
[01:07] <thor> emo_: they are in the ~/.mozilla/firefox/????.default folder...but you will need to see what ???.default really is

[01:07] <tim167> how do I import adress book from thunderbird-XP to new thunderbird-ubuntu ?
[01:07] <thor> emo_ it is different for each user
[01:07] <sethk> scapor, I was afraid of that
[01:07] <bluescreen> has anyone an idea what i can do to speed up the init ????
[01:07] <gyaresu> wiz, I just don't know how to do it with the clicky buttons. Once  window is on a desktop (I use 5 virtual ones), It will open there next time (in my experience)
[01:07] <sethk> scapor, it's hard to mess up a file that way and only end up with one messed up line.
[01:07] <sethk> scapor, you might try running fsck on your file system.
[01:07] <Trunkz> gah
[01:07] <Trunkz> its being gay
[01:07] <Trunkz> someone help me x_x
[01:07] <sethk> scapor, if it's the root file system, you'll have to boot the live cd

[01:08] <jadacyrus> Can someone help me get my logitech quickcam working?..its listed under lsusb, but camorama and other programs dont recognize it
[01:08] <Tokenbad> ok I removed proftpd and then tried to reinstall and now get an error saying: IPv6 getaddrinfo 'You-desktop' error: Name or service not known....Anyone know this?
[01:08] <sethk> jadacyrus, probably you need to load a kernel module
[01:08] <wiz> Is xfce less resource intensive than gnome?
[01:08] <sethk> jadacyrus, lsusb will see it at the vendor id/device id level, without kernel support, but the programs won't see it without kernel support
[01:09] <tim167> how can i import message filter settings i had on thunderbird-XP to thunderbird-ubuntu ? (also want to import address book, and mail archive)
[01:09] <sethk> wiz, by reputation, yes.  I haven't actually measured it myself and I'm always a skeptic
[01:09] <scapor> sethk: can't the root file system be checked from the maintenace shell you get with the debug-mode boot ?
[01:09] <emo_> thor: any strange stuff my pc behaving strange like sometimes the icone from my internet conection keep lighting without I'm being browsing ...
[01:09] <sethk> tim167, you should be able to use the export to a file in windows, and then import from a file in ubuntu
[01:09] <wiz> sethk, what about gnome - kde, which is less?
[01:09] <sethk> scapor, possibly.  if it is set up to run entirely from a ram disk.
[01:10] <thor> emo_: sometimes it will...it needs to communicate with the dhcp server and other places.
[01:10] <sethk> scapor, try it.  if it can run without mounting the root file system, then the answer is yes.

[01:10] <tim167> sethk: I used 'mozbackup' on windows to save everything to .pcv file
[01:10] <jadacyrus> sethk: do you know what kernel module i need to load?
[01:10] <thor> emo_: to know if it is a problem you really need to capture the packets with wireshark or some such tool and see what is being sent/received
[01:11] <bluescreen> hello can someone help me with my init problem ?
[01:11] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, what's the output of the lsusb line
[01:11] <JohnM555> Hello, I just installed my wireless drivers with the ndiswrapper(I hope I did anyway :P) but I am not sure how to setup my wireless to work with wep encryption. The site I was looking at says to refer back to the Basic Connection guidelines, but those don't help me. I was wondering if somebody could help me setup my wireless connection, or point me to a good reference.
[01:11] <sethk> tim167, sorry, I'm not familiar with that format.  you can try to import it, if it can't do it, it will yell at you.

[01:12] <sethk> bluescreen, very likely there is a lot of stuff starting that you don't need.  You may also be seeing a timeout trying to get network configuration.

[01:13] <JohnM555> this*
[01:13] <bluescreen> it shows that the init process takes 55 seconds
[01:13] <gyaresu> JohnM555, have you read the man to iwconfig?
[01:13] <baxter_kylie> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I /think/ cab files are actually .zips... try renaming then unzipping.
[01:14] <bluescreen> on my desktop pc its 3 seconds

[01:14] <bluescreen> how can this be ?
[01:14] <JohnM555> Um, there was one page that talked about that briefly
[01:14] <JohnM555> It didn't say much about it
[01:14] <emo_> thor: no that's right I think that isn't my machine...
[01:14] <gyaresu> JohnM555, It is to wireless what ifconfig it to ethernet.
[01:15] <Alex> G'day. I appear to only be able to mute my soundcard, rather than turn it down? It's an SiS...something.. :) Is this a common problem, anyone?
[01:15] <JohnM555> I do know that much :)
[01:15] <gyaresu> JohnM555, You'll get a lot out of reading the iwconfig man page.
[01:15] <testing> hi please
[01:15] <testing> i need help

[01:15] <gyaresu> Johan666, (and preface peoples name when you talk to them or they won't see you)
[01:15] <thor> emo_: you might try this...instead of clicking on the firefox icon to run the program open a terminal and type 'firefox'. Then, when firefox crashes there should be some information in the terminal window about what happened.

[01:22] <LordMetroid> http://ia300105.us.archive.org/3/items/Michael_Badnarik/ <-- Damn, he really is educative! I wish was soverign though with USA turning into shit I will never have any hopes for that!
[01:22] <sethk> ClayG, I've had good results with the IBMs, but their prices are a bit higher.
[01:22] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, should have a /dev/video or somesuch now...
[01:22] <ReWT_AxS> How do I change text after the "@" I guess I should say.
[01:22] <ClayG> price is not a concern
[01:22] <thor> kmull: my upgrade to edgy went bad too...X wouldn't start. I found that all I had to do was go through the upgrade again from the command prompt. It appears edgy cannot upgrade X if you attempt to run the upgrade from a terminal within X
[01:22] <ClayG> i am thinking about another HPdv6000t, sony, toshiba, ibm/len or macbook
[01:23] <sethk> ClayG, then I would go with a thinkpad, if you want an x86 type box.
[01:23] <ClayG> but kinda want to be able to run 'doze
[01:23] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: yes.. /dev/video0 exists
[01:23] <sethk> ClayG, sony's battery prices are outrageous, and their batteries also don't last
[01:23] <kmull> @thor: do you have a GTalk account to walk me through it?
[01:23] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, you right from here?
[01:23] <ey> XAWTV X Error of failed request:  XF86DGANoDirectVideoMode WHAT does it MEAN??
[01:23] <ey> :S
[01:23] <thor> kmull: when you upgrade again from the command prompt, all that will be installed the second time around is X...the rest is already there. And no...no gtalk
[01:23] <ClayG> also my hpdv6000 had built in bluetooth and webcam
[01:23] <ClayG> loved that
[01:23] <sethk> ClayG, well, none of the laptop batteries last all that long, but I've had more problems with the sonys
[01:23] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: well the camera still isnt being detected
[01:23] <thor> kmull: I am on a boat on my way to the bahamas...sitting in a marina in AL
[01:23] <ClayG> sethk: the hp lasted 2 hours, lol
[01:24] <ReWT_AxS> thor so dont u[grade in terminal?
[01:24] <ClayG> with moderate use, no burning, no wifi still died at 2 hours
[01:24] <gyaresu> !offtopic > ClayG  sethk
[01:24] <sethk> ClayG, the battery, you mean?
[01:24] <ClayG> sorry gayresu
[01:24] <ClayG> yeah
[01:24] <gyaresu> ClayG, just too busy in here....
[01:24] <gyaresu> ClayG, you understand.
[01:24] <kmull> @thor: I live in Bham. Lucky dog you.
[01:24] <rsteele> sup
[01:24] <thor> ReWR_AxS: that is my interpretation of what I have seen. I think if you stop X first, then upgrade from a tty it might go OK
[01:24] <ClayG> gotcha yeah of coarse
[01:24] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, detected by what?
[01:24] <kmull> @thor: do I just plug it in to my router, then do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[01:24] <jadacyrus> camstream..camorama...any program that uses the camera
[01:25] <gravyface> ubuntu 6.06 server on a compaq proliant DL380 == uber slow install
[01:25] <ClayG> so sethk what would you go with, it price was no concern, to run ubuntu of coarse, lol
[01:25] <aios> where can i find grub.conf?
[01:25] <rsteele> investigating
[01:25] <gravyface> use the find command aios
[01:25] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, and you are pointing it /dev/video0 in prefs?
[01:25] <sethk> ClayG, ubuntu runs very well on my thinkpads, including the wireless
[01:25] <thor> kmull: yeah...from the command prompt upgrade just like you did from the terminal. When I did that apt-get went out and got X and after that everything booted fine. Worth a try
[01:25] <ReWT_AxS> well damn
[01:25] <ReWT_AxS> lol
[01:25] <gyaresu> gravyface, aios use 'locate'
[01:25] <aios> gravyface: the find command doesnt find anything
[01:25] <kmull> @thor I'll try that and get the results back here
[01:25] <kmull> @thor: enjoy the Bahamas!
[01:25] <gyaresu> gravyface, aios  update the locate database by 'sudo updatedb'
[01:26] <ClayG> try locate
[01:26] <aios> gyaresu: locate either. i guess i have to update the db, but i still dont knwo how
[01:26] <sethk> aios, grub.conf may not exist
[01:26] <gravyface> oi what happened to find?
[01:26] <wastrel> <3 sudo updatedb
[01:26] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: ..there are no preferences..the only device that comes up listed is my tv tuner card..i tihnk that might be /dev/vide0 actually
[01:26] <sethk> aios, grub.conf is just a symbolic link to menu.lst
[01:26] <aios> gyaresu: thanks, thats a big help
[01:26] <sethk> aios, menu.lst is the real file.  grub.conf is optional
[01:26] <aios> sethk: thanks you!
[01:27] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, try the old unplug/plug and tail -f /var/log/messages
[01:27] <rBlong2u1> ok so unless I am not a programmer I won't be able to run Ubunutu ATM ---->"then just sis based cards. the same vid card works in breezy so the xog devs broke something end of story."
[01:27] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: Nov  7 19:27:15 nanofiber kernel: [17181825.172000]  usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 10

[01:28] <aios> gyaresu: is it safe to update grub.conf directly, or should i use some tool?
[01:28] <LGKeiz> baxter_kylie: i tried installing the driver, it successed but still no network list =/
[01:28] <AsheD> how do I make Evolution continue running in the background, with a tray icon, instead of a full window?
[01:28] <sethk> aios, back up the file, then update away.
[01:28] <shwag> how do I check what version of a file is installed ?
[01:28] <aios> sethk: thanks
[01:29] <sethk> aios, there are some tools you can use, but I prefer editing.  if you're comfortable with editing the file, it's perfectly ok.
[01:29] <gyaresu> aios, update menu.lst and install the new boot parameters by 'grub-install --no-floppy'
[01:29] <azureal> could someone briefly explain what svn and cvs is ?
[01:29] <sethk> gyaresu, not necessary to install after updating
[01:29] <sethk> gyaresu, if grub is already installed, you just change the file
[01:30] <gyaresu> sethk, really? that's new.
[01:30] <shwag> is aptitude better the apt-get ?
[01:30] <gyaresu> sethk, Probably not new but old habits die hard.
[01:30] <aios> gyaresu: sethk: so it'll be changed after reboot? .. i'm trying to add acpi=on, if that matters..
[01:30] <sethk> gyaresu, lilo needs to be updated.  grub understands the file system  :)
[01:30] <charles> does anyone do any FPGA work (with xilinx hardware)?
[01:30] <neemz> Hey folks, I have Xgl and Beryl working nicely, but I want to switch to AIGLX + beryl so my games will run, how can I switch over?
[01:30] <[GuS] > Bonne Nuit!
[01:30] <sethk> aios, yes, it will be reflected at the next boot
[01:30] <gyaresu> aios, yep.
[01:30] <aios> thanks
[01:30] <foomanchew> anyone use Cacti here ?
[01:30] <sethk> aios, you can also change parameters at the grub boot prompt, if you want to try it out before you edit the menu.lst
[01:31] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: ..hmm im reading this page you sent me says people got it to work with this spca5xx driver..how come it does not work for me?
[01:31] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, I don't know. Did you get out put from 'messages'
[01:31] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: yes
[01:31] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, and dmesg?
[01:31] <aios> sethk: you mean, in case it crashes horrible? :) i'll try, then. thanks.
[01:31] <beavis> can someone tell me where is the idea pool for  Feisty Fawn?
[01:31] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: yes...the one from messages just said new full speed usb device..same thing with dmesg
[01:32] <sethk> aios, well, that's one thing.  when I'm playing around, I copy the one I'm working on, and make another one just like it, then make changes to the copy.  that way I still can boot the original.  with the file backed up, you can always revert, also
=== lebir is now known as [BIR]

[01:33] <Toma-> kmull: caps lock on?

[01:33] <astrum-x> what would be the best way to install the tun/tap driver in ubuntu?
=== CrankymonkyVOTIN is now known as Crankymonky
[01:33] <sethk> kmull, do you get an error message?
[01:33] <kmull> sudo: 1 incorrect password attempt
[01:33] <kmull> when i type in the password and hit enter, it doesn't move up a line
[01:33] <astrum-x> or could someone point the best way to recomplile my kernel, i am a gentoo user and this my first experience with a pre-built kernel
[01:33] <kmull> i have to hit enter twice to get it to react
[01:33] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, are you running edgy (i can only think that a kernel upgrade might have some love for you)
[01:34] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: yes i am on edgy..with 2.6.17-10-generic
[01:34] <sethk> astrum-x, install the kernel source, copy the config file from /boot to the root of the source tree.  exactly the same as gentoo at that point
[01:34] <thor> kmull: you were working off a bad upgrade, right?
[01:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sigh..
[01:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I wish I could get wireless to work
[01:34] <kmull> thor: yes
[01:34] <JohnM555> Ugh...this is so frusturating
[01:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> it's not showing any networks.
[01:34] <sethk> astrum-x, the kernel is the kernel.  the only difference is that the package manager will put it at /usr/src/kernel-version-string, instead of /usr/src/linux
[01:34] <kmull> thor: i can't do apt-get etc. without sudo accepting my password
[01:35] <astrum-x> thanks
[01:35] <thor> kmull: you might have corrupted the shadow password file...and I don't know how to recover that.
[01:35] <sethk> kmull, the wonders of sudo, yes.  did it ever work for you?  is this a new installation, or did it work and then get messed up?
[01:35] <kmull> thor: super!
[01:35] <astrum-x> do i need to do anything special the debian way?
[01:35] <thor> kmull: have you tried switching to another tty (alt-F2 through alt-F6?)
[01:35] <GaiaX11> When I log into the system there are some messages while booting. So, which is the file that stores those messages. I need to find an error in my boot time that should be there.
[01:35] <sethk> kmull, if your password is bonked, you can boot the live cd, remove it from passwd and shadow, and then reset it
[01:35] <kmull> sethk: it worked in the past, the bad upgrade is what i am dealing with now
[01:35] <astrum-x> or does anyone know a faster way to install the tun/tap driver
[01:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Does anyone know why my eth1 isn't scanning for networks it saids "no scan results" I tried adding it manually, I've installed my windows driver, with wrapper, and still it doesn't work.
[01:36] <JohnM555> On this site: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessNetworking The screenshot shows a box to enter the WEP key, I need that, but mine doesn't have that option, I was looking in some of the wifi docs, but so far I haven't come across iwconfig docs
[01:36] <sethk> kmull, boot the live cd.  then you can either remove the password, and set it again after you reboot.  if you know how, you can chroot and set it directly
[01:36] <kmull> thor: alt-f2 worked...
[01:36] <thor> sethk: the live CD works from ram...how do you get it to write the changes to the hard drive?
[01:36] <kmull> one sec
[01:36] <thor> kmull: alt-f1 is where you are trying to start X....that is probably the problem
[01:36] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: do you think its possible that my TV Tuner card could be interfering with the camera drivers?
[01:37] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, no.
[01:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Well does anyone
[01:37] <sm> hi.. can anyone help me get mysql running again on ubuntu edgy on amd 64 ? it fails on startup
[01:37] <sethk> thor, you can mount the root file system somewhere.  then remove the string between the colons for the user in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.  Or, after mounting, you can do chroot /mnt/wherever, and then /mnt/wherever becomes your root file system
=== jkimball4__ is now known as jkimball4
[01:37] <gyaresu> JohnM555, Still havn't tried 'man iwconfig' ?
[01:37] <sethk> thor, once you do the chroot, then it is as if you had booted normally.  so you set the passwd, and it writes
[01:38] <gyaresu> LGKeiz, are you using 'iwlist eth1 scan' ?
[01:38] <thor> sethk: cool...I didn't know you could get into the passwd files
[01:38] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> gyaresu, would you know why I don't get any network results with scan
[01:38] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lgkeiz@lgkeiz-laptop:~$ iwlist eth1 scanning
[01:38] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> eth1      No scan results
[01:38] <sethk> thor, as root, you can
[01:38] <sm> mysql error: http://rafb.net/paste/results/tpAsqH57.html
[01:38] <sethk> thor, and of course when you boot the live cd you are root
[01:38] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: is there anything else besides the spca5xx driver that I need to have?
[01:38] <gyaresu> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, drivers are not working properly.
[01:38] <thor> sethk: right....guess I never faced it so never figured it out <smile>
[01:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> gyaresu: I've installed wrapper, installed my driver, restart -> still no scan results
[01:39] <sethk> thor, doesn't come up often, but very valuable when you need it.
[01:39] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, I can't see anything. I'd try adding that driver to /etc/modules and rebooting.
[01:39] <thor> sethk: cool trick....much better than Tom's Root Boot
[01:39] <kmull> apt-get dist-upgrade says there is a failure fetching the files
[01:39] <gyaresu> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, iwconfig does list a device though?
[01:39] <JohnM555> I thought I installed my driver correctly, but it says the wlan0 interface should exist and it doesn't
[01:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> gyaresu - sec
[01:39] <JohnM555> Or are they unrelated?

[01:43] <kmull> thor: ok. let me try. i am having to switch cables back and forth
[01:43] <robio376> #Nickserv
[01:43] <gyaresu> raghu206, appear how? from command line? running what prog?
[01:43] <gyaresu> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, aye. problem then.
[01:43] <raghu206> gyaresu, the drive doesnt appear on the desktop
[01:44] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> gyaresu: hold on I'm going to try to manually connect to the network
[01:44] <crzygrndpa> Kingsqueak: awesome, that worked. Thanks!
[01:44] <gyaresu> raghu206, do you know how to use the command line?
[01:44] <astrum-x> so what is this intrid image?
[01:44] <rBlong2u1> hi
[01:44] <astrum-x> never seen that before in grub.conf
[01:44] <rBlong2u1> is it possible to change the framebuffer
[01:44] <raghu206> gyaresu, i know but i need to mount it automatically editing fstab
[01:44] <sethk> astrum-x, initrd is an in-memory file system.  usually used to load drivers needed to boot from disk
[01:45] <jadacyrus> gyaresu:..Still no luck..i also removed my tv tuner card and now there is no /dev/video at all
[01:45] <gyaresu> raghu206, so 'sudo fdisk -l' sees it fine?
[01:45] <astrum-x> sethk: so after i recompile my kernel, do i need to replace both files in /boot/grub?
[01:45] <sethk> astrum-x, usually not
[01:45] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, it'n not being recognised. sorry.
[01:45] <jadacyrus> gyaresu: dang!!!
[01:45] <rBlong2u1> hey how do I go about changing famrebuffer with ubuntu, I know how to do this in Gentoo, but I don't fine a way to tweak the kernel with Ubuntu
[01:46] <sethk> astrum-x, if you did, you would probably know it.  Unless you added a module that needs to be loaded so the box can boot, you don't have to worry about it.
[01:46] <gyaresu> jadacyrus, but one of those comments (suse guy) seemed to work. so don't give up hope.
[01:46] <raghu206> gyaresu, it shows me correct
[01:46] <sethk> rBlong2u1, it's exactly the same in gentoo and ubuntu.  it's just kernel config
[01:46] <gyaresu> raghu206, and so have you entered an fstab entry and marked it as 'auto'
[01:46] <kmully> thor: i can't ping anything. iwconfig shows eth0 has "no wireless extensions"
[01:47] <thor> kmully: right...sounds like you lost the wifi drivers in the aborted upgrade
[01:47] <rBlong2u1> sethk: is there a kernel config in Ubuntu?
[01:47] <ThomBrown> how do you format an external hd in Ubuntu?
[01:47] <kmully> im plugged directly in though?
[01:47] <raghu206> gyaresu, the other drives mount with out that option
[01:47] <sethk> rBlong2u1, the kernel configuration is part of the kernel.  has nothing to do with distros.  it's the same in all distros.
[01:47] <luke2008> does anybody know if BCM4318 wireless network adaptor work in Ubuntu?
[01:47] <thor> kmully: then iwconfig has no meaning...try ifconfig and see if you have an ip address
[01:47] <gyaresu> raghu206, so do you want it to automount or not?
[01:48] <gyaresu> luke2008, have you searched the web?
[01:48] <sethk> rBlong2u1, if you mean the kernel configuration that is the first step of a kernel build, indeed, it's exactly the same
[01:48] <raghu206> gyaresu, exactly i want it
[01:48] <astrum-x> erm, i don't really want to recompile cause i don't have my kernel conf file
[01:48] <Moltov> erm... back >.<
[01:48] <ThomBrown> anyone??
[01:48] <sethk> astrum-x, yes you do.  it's in /boot
[01:48] <ThomBrown> how do you format an external hd in Ubuntu?
[01:48] <gyaresu> raghu206, so why would you not put 'auto' in your fstab?
[01:48] <astrum-x> so is there a better way to install the tun/tap driver
[01:48] <sethk> ThomBrown, mkfs.  you don't exactly format.  but mkfs is what you want
[01:48] <motin> What's happening? Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/php5/php5-common_5.1.2-1ubuntu3.3_i386.deb  404 Not Found
[01:48] <gyaresu> ThomBrown, fdisk
[01:49] <rBlong2u1> sethk:  you I have this horrible flickering issue with Ubuntu... now I gotta fix a few stuff and hope then it no longer will flicker
[01:49] <gyaresu> ThomBrown, then mkfs.
[01:49] <raghu206> gyaresu, i mean the other drives that appear automatically doesnt have auto
[01:49] <Moltov> If theres a mod around or yknow anyone that can kick... "RogueThunder" is just my shadow >.< inet bliped.
[01:49] <sethk> rBlong2u1, I remember, yes.
[01:49] <Moltov> Anyway...
[01:49] <gyaresu> raghu206, your point?
[01:49] <janga> ThomBrown, gparted, if you want GUI

[01:49] <sethk> rBlong2u1, get rid of the frame buffer, if it's in use.  make sure your vertical frequency is different than your house current frequency (house current freq is usually 60hz in north america, 50 hz in europe)
[01:50] <raghu206> gyaresu, i think shud i chage UUID in fstab?
[01:50] <gyaresu> ThomBrown, yes. If you want to change the partitions.

[01:59] <raul> sorry for all
[01:59] <motin> why on earth is this channel not split up into areas of interest? #ubuntu-networking, #ubuntu-installation, #ubuntu-server  etc?
[01:59] <RPO> When I try to change my screen resolution from 1280x1024 to something lower (1024x768, 800x600), it takes me back to the logon screen and it won't change.
[01:59] <Moltov> because getting help from someone whos good at more than one would be insane then mortin
[01:59] <neemz> btw is there a better channel for me to ask about my broken xserver?
[01:59] <D13GU> gyaresu,  how to? install 6.10? :)
[01:59] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: in /etc/apt/sources.list  is multiverse and universe and restricted enabled?
[02:00] <leitao> Hello. I have installed ubuntu 6.10, and i want to change the Applications Icon, which actually is with the ubuntu logo.  How could i do that?

[02:00] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:   I don't know, how do I view it?
[02:00] <gyaresu> D13GU, sorry on phone.
[02:00] <Moltov> Motin: not realy... i guess its a geek skill to be able to see through this all
[02:00] <D13GU> gyaresu,  ok
[02:00] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: do this    grep restricted /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:00] <motin> Moltov: well - the noobs wont se it, and they need the help
[02:01] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> !paste

[02:01] <Pretorian^> I've set a directory's permission to 300 (write and execute is only available for current user). If I, through bash, write "sudo ls", I can see the files. I'd like to do something similar in the File Browser. How do I do that?
[02:01] <Moltov> Motin: What my real question is, why arnt those who are working something out 1-1 using private chats, hence clearing the main room up
[02:01] <motin> "Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/php5/php5-xsl_5.1.2-1ubuntu3.3_i386.deb  404 Not Found" again and again - I now that "http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/php5/php5-xsl_5.1.2-1ubuntu3.4_i386.deb" exists. will it be the same if I install from manually downloaded debs?
[02:01] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30571/
[02:01] <robio376> D13GU, I would suggest a clean install of 6.10 rather then an upgrade
[02:01] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> o.o
[02:01] <raul> how can i burn a CD on this OP
[02:01] <raul> OS
[02:01] <RPO> When I try $ sudo apt-get dist-update it says:  E: Invalid operation dist-update
[02:01] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: k, one sec
[02:01] <Tokenbad> ok I removed proftpd and then tried to reinstall and now get an error saying: IPv6 getaddrinfo 'You-desktop' error: Name or service not known....Anyone know what it means about ipv6?
[02:02] <motin> Moltov: because then others couldnt help out together
[02:02] <SpudDogg> Does anyone know of a command-line encrypted chat program?  I sometimes need to talk to a buddy securely.

But if i put in the layout screen0 rightof screen1 one of the screens has the inccorect resolution.  Any ideas so that my mouse scrolls the correct direction
[02:02] <bimberi> raul: burn a cd from iso? copy one? ...?
[02:02] <Moltov> Motin: same problem with your solution to the clutter, most knolageible people we have, are very diverse, not spesific like that.
[02:02] <robio376> do a backup first

[02:03] <snoops> I've got a mysql db with some data in it I need to keep, but I'm interesting in upgrading (a clean install) from dapper to edgy..if I dump all the data, including indexed columns etc, can I just import my mysql dump back in without any problems?
[02:03] <thor> apokryphos: no...I installed kde over ubuntu to have the option, and now xchat goes to konq instead of firefox
[02:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: o.k., next up   modprobe -l ipw*
[02:04] <apokryphos> thor: alt+f2 -> kcontrol  and then look for components. Change default browser to Firefox
[02:04] <apokryphos> thor: also, if you can please file a bug report about that.
[02:04] <motin> "Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/php5/php5-xsl_5.1.2-1ubuntu3.3_i386.deb  404 Not Found" again and again - I now that "http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/php5/php5-xsl_5.1.2-1ubuntu3.4_i386.deb" exists. will it be the same if I install from manually downloaded debs?
[02:04] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30573/
[02:04] <apokryphos> thor: xchat should respect gnome's default when in gnome
[02:05] <thor> apokryphos: I actually run enlightenment, and have gnome and kde just for 'teaching/demo' purposes
[02:05] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: o.k., what exact model Dell is this?
[02:05] <apokryphos> ahh
[02:05] <azureal> lol teaching/demo?
[02:05] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Inspiron 1300
[02:06] <apokryphos> thor: ok, well it seems to be  taking the kde default, so the change in kcontrol should still work
[02:06] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: gimme a bit, gonna look that up
[02:06] <sethk> motin, the 404 error is an http protocol thing, so it won't have that problem if you download the deb
[02:06] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  k
[02:06] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  thanks
[02:06] <sethk> motin, assuming the error code is correct.  I have no reason to think it isn't.
[02:06] <thor> apokryphos: thanks...will boot into kde in a bit and try it
[02:06] <motin> sethk: yes it is. but will apt and all be able to uninstall it if I download them from the web?
[02:06] <apokryphos> thor: no need to boot into kde. Just alt+f2 -> kcontrol
[02:06] <twstokes> Is three a way in Gnome to remove a certain application from the panel?
[02:06] <raul> Pelo the problem is that what i have is a movie and i want to make a copy of it.
[02:07] <lovethepirk> i run breezy and just downloaded 6.10 can i upgrade using the cd or do i have to write over my current version
[02:07] <mayalces> #univalle
[02:07] <janga> twstokes, rightklick on menu
[02:07] <Pelo> raul,   you mean copy a dvd ?
[02:07] <shini`> lovethepirk: i think it's better to do a clean install :|
[02:07] <raul> yeah.
[02:07] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_:  next    lsmod | grep bcm
[02:07] <Pelo> ...
[02:07] <sethk> motin, yes
[02:07] <raul> pelo yeah
[02:07] <sethk> motin, installing from a local .deb will not harm your database.
[02:08] <motin> apt-get update is apparently NOT getting the updated security-sources. that is the core problem. why could that be and how can I fix that?
[02:08] <lovethepirk> shini`: should i format first or will the cd iso do that for me?
[02:08] <sethk> motin, only the initial download would be different.
[02:08] <motin> thats good sethk
[02:08] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30574/
[02:08] <sethk> motin, you already checked the obvious things like the repos, right?
[02:08] <Pelo> raul,  I don't know,  search for  dvd  in synaptic , maybe you have a package to rip dvd's and then you can copy it
[02:08] <raul> pelo i want to copi a movie that i have in one CD to another empity CD
[02:08] <twstokes> What do I do once I right click the menu?
[02:08] <lonran> how can i avoid loading a module at startup?
[02:08] <sethk> motin, I've been toggling between this window and some paying customers.  :)
[02:08] <Pelo> raul,   oh
[02:08] <aios> my laptop fan keeps running non-stop - i've now tried adding acpi=on, and #defoptions= quiet splash vga=791 noapic in grub/menu.lst ... i still don't really know what i'm doing, and i can't find much info online ..
[02:08] <twstokes> The program is Banshee
[02:08] <shini`> lovethepirk: the cd will make you do it, so you can just use the CD installer
[02:08] <motin> sethk: yes - it is a fresh ubuntu install - I trust the ubuntu devs
[02:09] <raul> pelo ?
[02:09] <sethk> aios, there is a separate kernel module for fan control, I believe.  let me check.
[02:09] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: o.k. edit this file  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and make an entry to blacklist 'bcm43xx'
[02:09] <Pelo> raul,  just pop the cd in , right-click on the icon on the desktop,  you should get a copy command
[02:09] <lovethepirk> shini`: thanks
[02:09] <aios> sethk: thanks
[02:09] <Pelo> raul , I think
[02:09] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> kingsqueak - uhm .. how do I edit again?
[02:09] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: the kernel driver is interfering with your ndis driver and you do indeed need the ndis driver for your card
[02:09] <janga> twstokes, edit menu , i dont know the exact translation.
[02:09] <raul> ok i'll try it,
[02:09] <sethk> motin, on a fresh install you have to remove the comments from some repos.  they are commented out in the installed file.  sorry if I'm repeating stuff.
[02:09] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> sudo gedit ?
[02:09] <mango> hi every one. I have set up dynds on dynds.com but I can not access my pc as it is behind a firewall, can any one help please

[02:10] <PapaLion> I'm stuck in a low resolution - ideas?
[02:10] <tag> which kernel am I supposed to use?
[02:10] <robio376> mango, you need to mae sure you have a port available through your firewall
[02:10] <bruenig> bobby, how are you trying to install it. A "sudo apt-get install cacti" should do
[02:10] <twstokes> Is there an option to add to the program command?

[02:10] <tag> that's not tight

[02:11] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  what now
[02:11] <mango> robio376: do I do that on the router
[02:11] <twstokes> Oh I see what you mean. My question is, once that program is open, how to I remove it from the window list?
[02:11] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu_: reboot now and see if it works, you still have ndis and the windows drivers installed right?
[02:11] <motin> anyone: what server do you get when you ping security.ubuntu.com ??
[02:11] <twstokes> I don't want to see it's window name once it is opened
[02:11] <RPO> I'm stuck in high resolution -- idea?
[02:11] <robio376> mango, yes, what type of router?
[02:11] <motin> I get auckland.ubuntu.com and maybbe it is lagging
[02:11] <PapaLion> I just installed edgy on an inspiron 1100 - stuck in a low resolution - anyone know the command to fix this?
[02:11] <Tokenbad> please can anyone help me with proftpd?
[02:11] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu_> Kingsqueak:  yeah it saids Hardware detected: yes lol so lets see

[02:12] <Pretorian^> I've set a directory's permission to 300 (write and execute is only available for current user). If I, through bash, write "sudo ls", I can see the files. I'd like to do something similar in the File Browser. How do I do that?

[02:12] <Boelcke> I think I need to reinstall ubuntu (for a printer problem).  How can I preserve all the stuff I've installed?

[02:13] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: well load the ndis driver however that works
[02:13] <Pelo> Boelcke,   backuping your user folder ( with all the hidden folder and files) will allow you to restor all the tweaks you may have done,  but you will have to re-install the apps
[02:14] <robio376> mango: sorry something like this 192.168.1.1:1234
[02:14] <LGKeiz-Windows> kingsqueak: it automatically loads on startup I think
[02:14] <teenprogrammer> how do i zip a folder in commandline?
[02:14] <mango> robio376: thanks for help , I will try than get back to you
[02:14] <Boelcke> Pelo, yes, I was figuring I'd backup home with all its hidden files.
[02:14] <robio376> mango: no problem
[02:15] <Boelcke> Pelo, but I suppose I'll have to run through and reinstall all the apps I've installed through Synaptic...
[02:15] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: what does   ndiswrapper -l   show you?
[02:15] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: actually   'sudo ndiswrapper -l'
[02:15] <Pelo> Boelcke,  that's what I said
[02:16] <LGKeiz-Windows> bcmwl5 driver present, hardware present

[02:16] <Crankymonky> Hey, I just installled Xubuntu Dapper, just curious why It's asked me to insert the CD every time I've installed apps-so far when installing Automatix and when using Automatix
[02:16] <mnepton> ThomBrown: "sudo apt-get install gparted"
[02:16] <teenprogrammer> how do i compress a folder into one file ... like zip ... only i need to do it from command line

[02:16] <RPO> My ubuntu Preferences-Screen resolution doesn't work.
[02:17] <LGKeiz-Windows> sudo apt-get remove wifi-radar *
[02:17] <LGKeiz-Windows> lol
[02:17] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: yes
[02:17] <motin> iaghty then - no help here - I will use the ones from not-security then
[02:17] <mnepton> Crankymonky: 1). edit /etc/apt/sources.lst and 2). do not use Automatix or any such scripts, please

[02:17] <Crankymonky> mnepton, Thanks for the sources hint, why so violently opposed to scripts?
[02:17] <luke2008> does BCM4318 work?
[02:17] <ThomBrown> THANKS
[02:17] <mnepton> teenprogrammer: tar -cvf filename.tar /path/to/dir && bzip2 filename.tar
[02:18] <mnepton> Crankymonky: because if they break in the *slightest* they can render a machine unusable.
[02:18] <Kingsqueak> you can do   tar jcvf file.tar.bz2  /foo    I think too
[02:18] <Crankymonky> mnepton, thanks for the tip
[02:18] <Tokenbad> please can anyone help me with proftpd?

[02:19] <nolimitsoya> *too
[02:19] <knix> Is there any way to get the rounded gnome-panel corners of gnome 2.2 in 2.16?
[02:19] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: o.k. now  'sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces'  comment out all the lines except the 'lo' two lines, like we did last night
[02:19] <LGKeiz-Windows> k sec
[02:19] <sethk> nolimitsoya, best is to use --preserve which is a meta option for all the permission related ones
[02:19] <twstokes> Janga, I found the solution
[02:19] <twstokes> Thanks for trying to help me
[02:20] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Windows: just be careful to NOT comment out lo or it will make a mess
[02:20] <twstokes> It was so simple I feel like an idiot
[02:20] <teenprogrammer> thanks for the archive command!
[02:20] <LGKeiz-Windows> Kingsqueak done lol
[02:20] <LGKeiz-Windows> want me to reboot?

[02:24] <bruenig> suckamc, they got rid of something like that. disk manager or something

[02:34] <robio376> mango: look for something called virtual servers
[02:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> k
[02:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I'll try..
[02:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  If you really want to I can setup a remote desktop program....
[02:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> So I won't mess up lol
[02:35] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: heh no, I'm not doing it *for* you
[02:35] <suckamc> so I moungt the drive and then ubuntu says that my permissions are denied the enter the /media/folder whats up with that?
[02:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lol
[02:36] <robio376> mango: you have to open a port to your pc your accessing

[02:38] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  .. lol
[02:38] <mumrah> i'm having a problem cds, dvds are fine though
[02:38] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  I think it's removed.
[02:38] <regeya> xubuntu's default destkop looks surprisingly like ubuntu's default desktop.
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: if you did all they said, now reinstall the driver
[02:38] <flasher> how do i know what version of flash i currently have??????????
[02:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: that modprobe ndiswrapper   should work after that
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lgkeiz@lgkeiz-laptop:~$ sudo rm -f /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> That removes it
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> right
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> lol
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: when it works right, nm-applet should see your interface
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  how do I reinstall it again?
[02:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> I need lthe link
[02:40] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: just put 'ndiswrapper' in the search box in the wiki
[02:40] <jeffreyb> flasher: Macromedia's detection page http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/welcome/ will interrogate your system for both Shockwave and Flash versions, including minor version details.
[02:40] <flasher> jeffreyb: thanks!1111
[02:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  Id on't see edgy lol
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[02:41] <mumrah> anyone? i just upgraded to edgy and now i cant read cds, but dvds work fine
[02:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: section 8.2 should be where you can start
[02:41] <suckamc> man.. it seems all the little nice things in ubuntu were taken away in 6.10 ... :/
[02:41] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  uhm I uninstalled ndiswrapper why would that work?
[02:42] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: you uninstalled the modules if you followed that page
[02:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  rofl
[02:42] <flasher> My flash version is 7.0.68.0 , which is the latest version (as per http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash). so how come one site is  telling me to upgrade to the latest version?
[02:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  ok lol
[02:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  brb
[02:43] <mango> robio376: the router is dg834g, I think that I found it . It is on the same firewall rules mentioned, and I need to setup the rule for inbound services, however, it does not give me the option to specify the port number when I choose ssh as the a service, it comes up with port22
[02:44] <iter> /etc/services
[02:44] <mango> robio376: I already specified the ip address for the host
[02:45] <kro> Is it is possible to install Ubuntu using floppies?
[02:45] <iter> kro: yes
[02:45] <robio376> mango: try port 22
[02:45] <kro> iter: are there downloadable images somewhere?
[02:45] <timthelion> can someone with edgy, who has hibernation working, paste their fstab file for me?
[02:45] <mango> robio376: would that be secure
[02:45] <iter> kro: yes but they were old, I think for hoary
[02:45] <timthelion> I can hibernate if I swapon my swap partition.
[02:45] <kro> iter: so nothing for edgy?
[02:45] <iter> kro: also it was a netinstall
[02:46] <kro> iter: netinstall would be fine
[02:46] <iter> kro: so you need net access of course
[02:46] <timthelion> I need to modify /etc/fstab so it can resume
[02:46] <robio376> mango: I generally try to specify a unique port, you can specify what pc's have access.
[02:46] <jeffreyb> flasher:  version 7 is latest for linux... but the latest for windows is 9. there is a version 9 beta out for linux.
[02:46] <iter> kro: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75372
[02:46] <iter> it's breezy

[02:47] <flasher> jeffreyb: and how is beta version 9 of flash compared to 7?
[02:47] <suckamc> is there anyway to be able to do root actions in gnome or does everything have to be done by terminal?
[02:48] <iter> quite a few gnome apps will ask for passwd to effect administratior level stuff
[02:49] <iter> alternatively you could launch your gnome app of choice from terminal with sudo <gnomeapp>
[02:49] <jeffreyb> little buggy here but works. http://www.kungfuice.com/index.php/2006/10/18/installing-flash-player-9-beta-on-ubuntu-edgy/
[02:49] <Pelo> suckamc,  you can start the ap you want with  gksu nautilus  ( for exemple) and run your app as root
[02:49] <bimberi> !gksudo
[02:49] <LjL> bimberi: offline
[02:49] <bimberi> :(
[02:49] <w00> anyone have a good repository for java and flash plugins? maybe wine? Thanks!
[02:49] <suckamc> iter: I mean to like change permissions of a file or folder
[02:49] <bimberi> yes, use gksu(do), not sudo
[02:50] <edgarin> lug.org.ve
[02:50] <bimberi> suckamc: gksudo nautilus  (not recommended, but a way to achieve it)
[02:50] <flasher> jeffreyb: thanks@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@!!
=== SportChick is now known as LagChick
[02:50] <kro> iter: thanks.  I think I'm gonna have to use etherboot to install edgy
[02:50] <bimberi> suckamc: use alt-F2 to run it and you haven't even used a terminal ;)
[02:51] <kro> iter: basically, put etherboot on a floppy, get a tftp image and then install.
[02:51] <LjL> w00: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[02:51] <suckamc> bimberi: is there another way I can get to som e root permissions through gnome? it seems silly to have the options ther but then not be able to use them
[02:51] <kro> I was hoping to avoid setting up a tftp server and such though
[02:51] <bimberi> suckamc: which options?
[02:51] <iter> kro: word
[02:52] <bimberi> suckamc: file permissions in nautilus? - only through 'gksudo nautilus'
[02:52] <w00> LjL, thanks i'll try that.
[02:52] <suckamc> well, copying and some system files... have to have root.. but I can't can't in nautilus, setting permissions, opening some folders
[02:52] <mumrah> i am unable to read cds after upgrading to edgy, and ideas?
[02:52] <AsheD> I am using mail-notification in conjunction with Evolution, but it says all emails are new, even after they have been read and replied to, anybody know how to fix this?
[02:52] <iter> suckamc: yeah gksudo nautilus from alt-f2
[02:53] <natu`> Anyone might know some ways to fix this problem: Had a problem with the gnome desktop (things weren't the same way I originally set them up)... deleted all the .gnome, .gnome2, etc files to get a fresh desktop. I logged in fine the first time, it ran smoothly... then loggin in the next day, the settings were changed, and it was running slowly again
[02:54] <arthurb> Hi... does anyone know where to get packages to have the moodbar working in amarok... for ubuntu edgy
[02:54] <jadacyrus> How come you cant have the linux-restricted-modules installed with the NVIDIA Beta 9625 driveR
[02:55] <iter> how come ubuntu doesn't give me a happy ending
=== LagChick is now known as SportChick
[02:56] <CarlFK> how can I tell if a package is installed (command line, not gui)
[02:56] <bimberi> CarlFK: apt-cache policy package
[02:56] <motin> sethk: i found the solution - removed the sources security rows - update - add again - update fetched the latest ones
[02:56] <Keyseir> !ubotu extended 2
[02:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about extended 2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:57] <Keyseir> !ubotu formatting
[02:57] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted  -  Formatting partitions: see the manual page for mkfs ("man mkfs")  -  Mounting partitions in Gnome: System -> Administration -> Disks
[02:57] <Kingsqueak> CarlFK: dpkg -l
[02:57] <bimberi> CarlFK: dpkg -l package   (look for ii at the start of the line)
[02:57] <Keyseir> How do I discern what format I should format a new HD?
[02:58] <LjL> Keyseir, what about using the default (which is ext3) if you don't have a preference
[02:58] <bimberi> Keyseir: sharing it with windows? -> fat32.  otherwise ext3
[02:58] <CarlFK> noo fat!  share the ext3 with win
[02:59] <Keyseir> OK, the first thing that popped up was "extended 2". You guys are suggesting "Extended 3"?
[02:59] <iter> ext3
[02:59] <LjL> !ext3
[02:59] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[02:59] <Keyseir> Is ext3 short for Extended 3?
[02:59] <iter> yes
[02:59] <regeya> ext3 == third extended filesystem (I think)
[02:59] <iter> omg a windows driver for ext2
[02:59] <iter> talk about scary
[02:59] <regeya> indeed.
[03:00] <LjL> iter, there are a few ones around actually
[03:00] <LjL> that's not the only one
[03:00] <jbroome> i used one for ext3 from sf.net
[03:00] <iter> the very notion of that is terrifying
[03:00] <CarlFK> LjL: i think it is the only one that does r/w as a driver
[03:00] <iter> I like my data uncorrupted, thankyew
[03:01] <CarlFK> iter, then you wouldn't be using win or fat, right ? :)
[03:01] <iter> ntfs is not that bad cmon
[03:01] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  you there
[03:01] <LjL> iter: if you want to share it with linux and like to have data uncorrupted, yes it's bad
=== Keyseir is now known as NTFS-is-bad
[03:01] <iter> LjL: eff that
=== NTFS-is-bad is now known as Keyseir
[03:02] <iter> LjL: that's what smb/cifs is for
[03:02] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  If you're there   sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/drivers/drivername.inf <-- how do I go to my driver it's on my desktop
[03:02] <LjL> iter, i'm sure you realize the issue with most people is dual boot...?
[03:02] <AdamKili> has there been any progress in the USB mass storage device recognition problem?
[03:02] <iter> dual boot is the biggest waste of time I can think of
[03:03] <iter> I reboot my workstation MAYBE once a month
[03:03] <andrewxps> anyone use ubuntu under parallels workstation - and get a terrible screen resolution???
[03:03] <LjL> iter, doesn't mean everybody does the same as you and uses computers the same way you do
[03:03] <iter> just get a hand-me-down dell and use synergy ;)
[03:03] <jadacyrus> synergy is cool
[03:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: ~/Desktop/<name>
[03:04] <iter> anyway how other people use computers has very little to do with buggy filesystem drivers that run in kernel mode on win32
[03:04] <jStefan> i'm actually considering this ext2 thing for windows, but i would like to make it read only (for safety)
[03:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: I suspect you didn't do this right the first time ;-)
[03:05] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  I used a GUI
[03:05] <LjL> iter, the issue is that if people dual boot and want to share a filesystem, it's going to be either NTFS, FAT32 or ext3 generally. NTFS is unsafe for writing on Linux, FAT32 is a weak filesystem generally speaking, and ext3 as far as i gather is relatively safe to write on Windows
[03:05] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: that'll teach ya
[03:05] <LjL> and filesystems run inside the kernel on Linux as we ll for that matter
[03:05] <RPO> Does anyone know how to make my DVD-RWs work (one won't mount and the other doesn't show up at all!)?
[03:06] <iter> psh I don't feel like arguing anymore, my only point is that I prefer my data nice and uncorrupted
[03:06] <iter> and fat32 has been around for ages
[03:06] <RPO> Does anyone know how to make a Read only system file RW?
[03:06] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  ..
[03:06] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> bcmwl5 is already installed. Use -e to remove it
[03:07] <tw|sT3d> guys were can i find my modem driver?
[03:07] <CarlFK> iter: if you din't want to argue, then you wouldn't say anything :)
[03:07] <suckamc> LjL: I've written to NTFS many times in ubntu with Ntfs-3g with no problems
[03:07] <LjL> !works for me
[03:07] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[03:07] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  lol done
[03:07] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> now what
[03:07] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  reboot?
[03:07] <iter> haha funny you would paste that ljl
[03:08] <iter> when we were just arguing about stable file systems ;)
[03:08] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: well when you did the ifup and ifdown what happened?  does ifconfig -a show wlan0 now?
[03:08] <adrenaline> Ok so I have easy ubuntu but some of the programs do not install any ideas?
[03:08] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: you *must* follow and read that doc
[03:08] <jStefan> i rather be able to pull files, instead of writing
[03:08] <suckamc> Ljl: just wanted to test the driver. and just stating, I've had no problems so far... lots of success
[03:09] <LjL> iter, i completely agree that you should just use ext3 on linux and ntfs on windows. BUT in many cases people simply start from the assumption that they're going to have a shared partition. and FAT32 might have been around for as long as you like, but it's still as weak a filesystem as it can get
[03:09] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> !paste
[03:09] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[03:09] <suckamc> Ljl: maybe means It might not be a good idea, but if someone won't test it it'll never get tested

[03:09] <iter> LjL: what is "weak" compared to a non-ms kernel mode driver from the oss world?
[03:10] <jStefan> inherently weak
[03:10] <LjL> iter: err hold on a second, what is the *Linux* ext3 driver if you a non-ms kernel mode driver from the oss world....:?
[03:10] <iter> LjL: there's tons of good code in linux but as far as writing stuff for windows ?!?!
[03:10] <adrenaline> i am trying to install libdvdcss via easy ubuntu but it won't install all though other stuff has any ideas?
[03:10] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Kingsqueak:  .. what now lol
[03:11] <iter> LjL: the difference being of course that there is adequate documentation for the linux kernel vs the windows kernel
[03:11] <tw|sT3d> guys, does ubuntu supoorts a US robotics modem???
[03:11] <bobby> us robotic modems are nearly always hardware modems (not win modems)
[03:11] <jStefan> i think the best solution is to be able to READ from the other OS and write locally, without the need of shared partitions. Linux can already read NTFS natively, and now we can make windows read ext2.
[03:12] <bobby> thus it probably suhould
[03:12] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: try this   'ndiswrapper-1.8'    does that command do anything for you?
[03:12] <iter> jStefan: agree
[03:12] <LjL> jStefan: that's a compromise that will work in many cases

[03:36] <mango> want to ask a silly question please. I recieved many tabs stating nazi in them what was that about? were they refered to me

[03:38] <sethk> aios, used for both, I believe.
[03:38] <sethk> aios, you monitor and change on the same bus, and that's the driver for the bus.

[03:41] <kronoman> hello

[03:44] <piedoggie> I need to do that on specific files in a hierarchy.  A selective fine is probably the best solution combined with your sed example
[03:44] <thor> dooglus: now that was impressive. When I grow up I want to learn bash scripting too <smile>
[03:44] <adam_> good evenin
[03:45] <boxahy> anyone else having problems with the wine wget servers?

[04:27] <eaglehawk> anyone who can help me with knetworkmanager
[04:27] <Mantice> I thought java was installed automaticly

[04:32] <LaserLine> I'm trying to create a key for launchpad using gpg --send-key key-id (key-id = xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx <-my key) but when I do that it says gpg: "xxxx" not a key ID: skipping
[04:32] <dooglus> st4hl: see the man page if you want to remove his files as well (home dir, or all)
[04:32] <st4hl> and how do i see which groups user belongs to?
[04:32] <st4hl> nod, thank you again =)
[04:33] <LordTureis> mushtaq: What do you mean 'in the list?' what list?
[04:33] <Mantice> when I try to install java 'Java Web Start 1.4' is not available in any software channel.
[04:33] <dooglus> st4hl: I log in as them and type "groups"
[04:34] <dooglus> st4hl: or "grep dooglus /etc/group"
[04:34] <jordan_> Mantice: You need to enable the multiverse repository.
[04:34] <st4hl> cool, thanks alot =)
[04:34] <st4hl> is there a fast way to add identical user?
[04:34] <LordTureis> I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, but I've got to go.
[04:34] <st4hl> just with a different name/pwd, but same groups
[04:35] <dooglus> st4hl: adduser has lots of options.  see "man adduser"
[04:35] <kokey> How can I install edgy in text mode with th live cd?

[04:36] <dooglus> st4hl: better not to.  "sudo adduser st4hl admin" will add st4hl to the admin group
[04:37] <dooglus> st4hl: so you can loop that: for group in $(groups); do sudo adduser st4hl $group; done
[04:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> >.>
[04:38] <st4hl> lol, excellent, thank you so much =)
[04:38] <jordan_> Mantice: I can install it on my machine, could you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list just to be sure ?
[04:38] <dooglus> st4hl: that'll add the new 'st4hl' user to each group that you're in

[04:49] <Mantice> So I tryed to install java but its saying it cant find it.
[04:49] <jStefan> !java | Mantice
[04:49] <sean> jStefan, yeah... I just ran autoremove and it cleared 700mb but my system seems to run fine
[04:49] <mushtaq> i need a simple application to run my scanner for end use
[04:49] <ubotu> Mantice: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository

[04:49] <crimsun> jazzrocker: not sure how you could miss linux-usb.org
[04:49] <Mantice> I did
[04:49] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Mantice, did you enable extra repositories?
[04:49] <mushtaq> they were using hp application now i want to use linux box for this purpose is it possible ?
[04:50] <daemoey> Palski: The problem with bluefish can be solved by first opening any random file. After that it will let you save a file without crashing
[04:50] <Mantice> How do I do that.
[04:50] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Mantice, system, administration, software properties, check all the boxes.....
[04:50] <daemoey> Palski: Just google a bit and theres a few other threads that talk about the issue. Its known by "people"
[04:50] <Max222-sweden> I can ping to a vpn server but i can not surf to a server in that network. But i can ping. Anybody has this problem?
[04:50] <jazzrocker> crimsun, i am, seeing as it doesn't occur here: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ubuntu+supported+usb+devices&btnG=Google+Search
[04:50] <jStefan> sean, autoremove removes packages that were installed automatically (as other package dependecies) and are no longer needed. But, it requires inspection of what it plans to do, so it doesn't remove something important
[04:51] <Mantice> I did.
[04:51] <sean> jStefan, Thanks :)
[04:51] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Mantice, now try installing java
[04:52] <crimsun> jazzrocker: go to the address I gave you, then click on "Working devices list"
[04:52] <jazzrocker> crimsun, you gave me an address?
[04:52] <Mantice> I removed every thing and I added them all again with the tick boxes
[04:52] <jazzrocker> crimsun, oh, linux-usb.org lol, k
[04:53] <jazzrocker> crimsun, already went there
[04:53] <jazzrocker> crimsun, hahah, actually i found that page already lol, didn't know it was related to linux-usb.org :)
[04:53] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Mantice, sudo aptitude update, then sudo aptitude install sun-java5-jre
[04:53] <crimsun> jazzrocker: my advice is simply to try both 6.06.1 and 6.10 desktop cds

[05:11] <Mantice> Jewfor-Macabbi: Thanks for that.
[05:11] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Mantice, you are welcome
[05:14] <dooglus> teenprogrammer: it should just work
[05:14] <dooglus> teenprogrammer: (I think)
[05:14] <teenprogrammer> um
[05:14] <teenprogrammer> whats the equivalent of windows ipconfig
[05:14] <teenprogrammer> in linux?
[05:14] <teenprogrammer> how do i find its ip address?
[05:14] <crimsun> ifconfig(1)
[05:15] <crimsun> err, ifconfig(8) even
[05:17] <PFA> how do i find out my processor speed/ other hardware specs?
[05:18] <dooglus> PFA: cat /proc/cpuinfo

[05:19] <PFA> thx dooglus
[05:20] <Pablo> anyone have any luck with swscanner?
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> Pablo, ya
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> i use it
[05:21] <nomasteryoda> works even with my broadcom chip
[05:22] <Pablo> are you running network monitor?
[05:22] <Pablo> can you right click on a ap and associate?
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> ah, well maybe
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> just sec
[05:22] <Pablo> ok
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> you mean the monitor tool in the tray?
[05:22] <nomasteryoda> or the swscanner
[05:23] <Pablo> well it seems the confilict with each other
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> oh
[05:23] <maxflax> anyone running a twinhan card?
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> i've seen some issue with that
[05:23] <Pablo> you seen a solution?
[05:23] <nomasteryoda> i just rightclick the icon and disable the wireless when i'm scanning
[05:23] <Pablo> oh
[05:23] <Lava_Croft> k this chan makes me cry just as ubuntu does
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> then reinable when done doing recon/.
[05:24] <daviddixon> i installed mplayerplug-in for firefox. but i still cant watch streaming video. where is the plugin located so i can copy it to my .mozilla folder.
[05:24] <Pablo> so you do not associate through swscanner?
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> nope
[05:24] <Pablo> you just use it to find ssid's?
[05:24] <Pablo> ok
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> i do it with gnome-network-manager
[05:24] <Pablo> it has the ability to be ur wireless manager
[05:24] <nomasteryoda> in the tray
[05:24] <dusk> what is the fix for googlevideo/youtube no lag?
[05:25] <Pablo> disable ipv6?
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> that might help
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, i use automatix
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> it makes the installation easier
[05:25] <daviddixon> ??
[05:25] <nomasteryoda> !automatix
[05:25] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:26] <Pablo> lol
[05:26] <daviddixon> hm.. doesnt sound too good
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> i have had no issues ... but then again, i selectively choose my software
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, the guide on the forum is simple to follow too
[05:26] <nomasteryoda> i used to do it that way
[05:26] <daviddixon> i know its installed just need to know where the plugin is located in the root directory so i can copy it to user
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> ok
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> linking is the prefered method
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> ln -s file file
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> symbolic link
[05:27] <nomasteryoda> let me find mine
[05:27] <teenprogrammer> how do i install apache/
[05:28] <daviddixon> right. do you know what it's called so i can search
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> apt-get install apache2?
[05:28] <jStefan> !apache | teenprogrammer
[05:28] <ubotu> teenprogrammer: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> sure
[05:28] <nomasteryoda> it works for me...
[05:29] <sethk> teenprogrammer, same way you install anything else.   easiest way is to search for apache in synaptic
[05:29] <teenprogrammer> i am trying to set it up on a server
[05:30] <phab> !save
[05:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about save - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
[05:30] <teenprogrammer> so i dont have the luxary of a gui
[05:30] <daviddixon> thanks
[05:30] <nomasteryoda> np
[05:30] <|rt|> anyone know what would cause an apache module to not be auto enabled when installed?
[05:30] <sethk> teenprogrammer, that's a misconception
[05:30] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:31] <jStefan> !info apache2
[05:31] <ubotu> apache2: next generation, scalable, extendable web server. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0.55-4ubuntu4 (edgy), package size 35 kB, installed size 80 kB
[05:31] <sethk> teenprogrammer, you can run gui setup programs on the server.  you have to direct the display to an X server, but that can be on any machine
[05:31] <teenprogrammer> ah
[05:31] <|rt|> I've installed php4 and the php4.load and php4.conf are not getting the sym links in the mods-enabled folder
[05:31] <|rt|> libapache-mod-php4 to be exact
[05:31] <sethk> teenprogrammer, X windows is layered properly, which unfortunately windows isn't.  there is a strict separation between display, and program
[05:32] <sethk> teenprogrammer, they can be on the same box, on different boxes.  You can run an X server on a windows box, and display your linux server configuration programs on it.
[05:32] <sethk> teenprogrammer, which can be useful if you don't have a box running X windows.
[05:32] <teenprogrammer> seriously?!?!
[05:32] <teenprogrammer> :O
[05:32] <teenprogrammer> i have a windows box
[05:32] <sethk> teenprogrammer, free X server is part of the cygwin package at www.cygwin.com
[05:32] <teenprogrammer> that would be amazing
[05:32] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:32] <|rt|> sethk: xming is a good windows xserver
[05:32] <teenprogrammer> wow!!! thanks sethk
[05:32] <sethk> |rt|, haven't used it much.  good performance?
[05:33] <|rt|> sethk: yes..and doesn't have the cygwin dependancy
[05:33] <sethk> teenprogrammer, |rt| is showing you an alternative X server for windows
[05:33] <sethk> teenprogrammer, there are others, but many are not free.  I'll have to try xming.
[05:33] <maxflax> can I modprobe modules with success without having the hardware for it?
[05:34] <teenprogrammer> so i need to install xserver on my ubuntu box right?
[05:34] <teenprogrammer> so windows can use it?
[05:34] <|rt|> teenprogrammer: yes
[05:34] <sethk> teenprogrammer, cygwin is rather large and takes a long time to install.  it has other advantages, though, it gives you good shells, and many other programs.  In fact, running the shell in windows makes it feel unix like, although it isn't terribly deep.
[05:34] <sethk> teenprogrammer, no
[05:34] <sethk> teenprogrammer, you don't have to
[05:34] <teenprogrammer> oh
[05:34] <sethk> teenprogrammer, the server can run X _client_ programs
[05:34] <teenprogrammer> oh
[05:34] <teenprogrammer> ic
[05:35] <sethk> teenprogrammer, then they will display on the X server, which can run anywhere, linux, windows, OSX, etc.
[05:35] <|rt|> teenprogrammer: what I do is ssh to my linux box using putty then with xming run the x programs
[05:35] <roach_> I'm trying to get Beryl installed on Edgy-AMD64, but can't find xserver-xgl for Edgy on AMD64 (as a packaged binary) in any of the repositories I've checked.  Does anyone know of a source I can add?
[05:35] <daviddixon> hm ..copied all the plugins over but still no video?
[05:35] <charles_> surabaya
[05:35] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, just sec
[05:35] <daviddixon> ok
[05:35] <sethk> |rt|, teenprogrammer I do something very similar, although I use a different ssh program.  same end result.
[05:35] <|rt|> sethk: wouldn't you have a hard time installing X programs without a local x server with is normally a dependancy
[05:35] <TMX> roach: I was going this earlier, try using beryl, Il dig out the walkthrough I was using
[05:35] <sethk> |rt|, no, not really
[05:35] <TMX> 8doing
[05:35] <sethk> |rt|, you can install only client support.  I have two boxes set up that way
[05:35] <paras> channel, If i run vidoes from you tube i can see the video but no sound... need a solution for this
[05:36] <|rt|> sethk: ah...cool
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, what does your about:plugins show?
[05:36] <sethk> |rt|, one mail server, one web server, neither has X installed, but the X client libraries are all you need
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> don't post here
[05:36] <|rt|> sethk: the box i do this to runs mythtv frontend so it has X installed
[05:36] <nomasteryoda> just see what it says
[05:36] <TMX> roach_, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/XGL
[05:36] <sethk> |rt|, indeed, I didn't say you can't, or you shouldn't, only that it isn't mandatory.
[05:36] <jordan_> paras: Are you using flash 9?
[05:36] <daviddixon> let me check
[05:37] <maxflax> can I modprobe modules with success without having the hardware for it?
[05:37] <maxflax> can I modprobe modules with success without having the hardware for it?
[05:37] <maxflax> can I modprobe modules with success without having the hardware for it?'
[05:37] <sethk> it's nice to have the option.  you can make a very compact server, and not give up the nice user interface
[05:37] <sethk> maxflax, yes
[05:37] <paras> jordan_, i guess no
[05:37] <paras> jordan_, do i need it?
[05:37] <|rt|> is there a ubuntu tool for managing apache modules or are you supposed to just manually set the symlinks?
[05:37] <crimsun> maxflax: depends on the module.
[05:37] <sethk> maxflax, all the probe does is make sure that module symbols are defined
[05:37] <daviddixon> just java and flash
[05:37] <sethk> maxflax, it loads any other modules that might be necessary
[05:37] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:37] <fluxinator> I recently installed edgy from live cd, and I wanted to know whether or not the root account is supposed to be enabled
[05:37] <maxflax> ok
[05:37] <roach_> TMX, thanks!
[05:37] <sethk> maxflax, now, the module is pretty useless without the hardware, but modprobe doesn't care.
[05:37] <jordan_> paras: Flash 7 has inherent sound problems because it uses OSS instead of ALSA, flash 9 fixes the sound issues.
[05:37] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, ok, well then they are not installed correctly
[05:37] <TMX> roach_: np :)
[05:38] <daviddixon> right
[05:38] <jordan_> !flash9 | paras
[05:38] <ubotu> paras: Flash player 9 beta has been released. You can download it here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for edgy)  -  Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[05:38] <zenmonk> how do u create a new shell and then how do you switch between shells?
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> what about apt-get install mplayer?
[05:38] <paras> jordan_, ok.
[05:38] <daviddixon> i installed them through apt
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> ok
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> hmmm
[05:38] <|rt|> fluxinator: ubuntu doesn't really come with root enabled out of the box...administration is intended to be done using sudo
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> stock firefox?
[05:38] <paras> ubotu, thanks i will install it right away
[05:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks i will install it right away - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:38] <nomasteryoda> edgy?
[05:39] <daviddixon> ah its broke
[05:39] <kokey> where can I find info about to install edgy in text mode?
[05:39] <roach_> grr - I just added "deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main-edgy main-edgy-amd64" as a source, per the guide.  I see beryl and emerald-themes, but not xserver-xgl...  :(
[05:39] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:39] <sethk> kokey, not sure, but it is extremely easy.  it's all menu driven.  it's not command line, it uses terminal based display
[05:39] <nomasteryoda> kokey, the alternate cd is used for that purpose
[05:39] <Healot> kokey: the alternate-install CD? wait a sec edgy has alternate-install CD right?
[05:40] <sethk> kokey, all you do is run it and answer the questions.  just as easy as a graphical install.
[05:40] <sethk> Healot, right
[05:40] <sethk> Healot, the alternate cd has text mode install, and oem install
[05:40] <sethk> Healot, for the most recent two versions.  before that, text mode and graphical were on one cd
[05:40] <kokey> sethk, but with the graphical install my lap hangs
[05:40] <fluxinator> |rt|, I know but I am looking through the users and groups and I see root there
[05:40] <zenmonk> how do you switch between multiple shells?
[05:40] <sethk> kokey, indeed, use the text mode install.  I'm just saying you don't need any docs
[05:41] <kokey> si do I need to download other cd?
[05:41] <sethk> kokey, yes
[05:41] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> kokey, what kind of laptop?
[05:41] <daviddixon> nomasteryoda: yeah edgy. says mplayer depends on libdirectfb-9.22 but i have 9.24 installed
[05:41] <tj__> i need a nice giu that i can use for a bash script i am writing, any ideas aside from zenity and dialog?
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> i had issues with a sony
[05:41] <fluxinator> |rt|,  there is root and fluxinator listed as accounts
[05:41] <kokey> nomasteryoda, it's a Dell inspiron 1150
[05:41] <nomasteryoda> oh, that should work fine with the alternate
[05:41] <CientificoLoco> ubuntu.es
[05:41] <CientificoLoco> ubuntu-es?
[05:41] <CientificoLoco> for japan?
[05:41] <sethk> kokey, some dells I've had issues with on graphical install.  others not.  text mode install is no problem
[05:41] <sethk> !es
[05:41] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[05:42] <crimsun> CientificoLoco: that would be #ubuntu-jp
[05:42] <sethk> CientificoLoco, es, for japan?  they speak spanish in japan now?  :)
[05:42] <fluxinator> !jp
[05:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about jp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:42] <fluxinator> hah

[05:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ime - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:42] <roach_> doh - never mind!  I didn't have "universe" checked (new/clean Edgy install)
[05:42] <Healot> dang
[05:42] <jrib> Where would be the right location for documentation about /etc/environment?  Specifcally, the use of $LANGUAGE
[05:43] <CientificoLoco> sethk, do you talk spanish?
[05:43] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in firefox messenger openoffice ... in Japanese?
[05:43] <sethk> CientificoLoco, I try, but my spanish needs a lot of work.
[05:43] <Healot> CientificoLoco: install the Japanese language support :0
[05:43] <micros> !x
[05:43] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[05:43] <CientificoLoco> Healot, but I wanna work whit spanich tittle and jut wanna write japanes
[05:44] <sethk> CientificoLoco, I know what you meant, by the way, you meant the japanese equivalent of the -es for spanish, I just couldn't resist  teasing you about it.
[05:44] <Healot> enabled SCIM or SKIM afterwards, then the configure the keyboard and the IME... kinda like the one you do in Windows
[05:44] <fluxinator> crimsun, I recently installed edgy from live cd, and I wanted to know whether or not the root account is supposed to be enabled
[05:44] <crimsun> !root
[05:44] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:44] <sethk> CientificoLoco, japanese support is available, but I know very little about the double byte and mixed single/double character sets
[05:44] <linlin> what would be the easiest way to download all files from an apache directory list like this http://newsreal.loveturtle.net/NewsReal/64kbps/
[05:44] <crimsun> fluxinator: it has not been so in my exp.
[05:44] <sethk> linlin, wget
[05:44] <fluxinator> crimsun, should I remove the root account
[05:44] <fluxinator> ?
[05:45] <linlin> yes i know but i want to do it automatically
[05:45] <sethk> linlin, script wget.
[05:45] <sethk> linlin, you'll find lots of examples of that
[05:45] <crimsun> fluxinator: I wouldn't, no.
[05:45] <fluxinator> crimsun, is there a way to disable logging in as root
[05:46] <sethk> linlin, there are programs around to keep two web servers in sync, you could use one of those perhaps to accomplish your purpose
[05:46] <CientificoLoco> sethk, ah!
[05:46] <CientificoLoco> :O
[05:46] <sethk> fluxinator, there is a way to set the password in such a way that you can't log in
[05:46] <jpedroza> hello. Can anyone here assist me in setting up a Formac 2010 LCD under Kubuntu-ppc?
[05:46] <sethk> fluxinator, ubuntu does that for one of the install modes, but not for oem install
[05:47] <sethk> jpedroza, does it "look" like a normal vga display?
[05:47] <Hansin321> I liked the thread on running an X-Server on a Windows box, running the clients off the "headless" Linux sever.  When starting a program from the "headless" box (say via PuTTY), how do you direct output to the X-Server running on the Windows box?  Thanks.
[05:47] <jpedroza> not really
[05:47] <sethk> jpedroza, I mean does it use the usual monitor interface?
[05:47] <jpedroza> it is a flat panel
[05:47] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in Japanes on firefox messenger openoffice ... ?
[05:47] <sethk> jpedroza, yes, I know
[05:47] <jpedroza> It is a digital flat panel on a DVI
[05:47] <sagar_> whenever i click a ".desktop" file, gnome gives me errors and says it cant open it..the same goes for image files, even after i add a file type association...is this a gnome-vfs problem or something??
[05:47] <fluxinator> sethk, I installed from live cd, and I see that root is enabled, and has its own unique password
[05:47] <teenprogrammer> does ubuntu have an editable motd?
[05:47] <sethk> jpedroza, ok, so it's a DVI interface
[05:47] <paras> ubotu, it says .. instalation failed
[05:47] <Fireal> does anyone have a link or mind describing how to have Caps Lock on when you log in?
[05:47] <daviddixon> I'm confused about what to do here? i have libdirectfb-9.24 installed yet mplayer wont properly install without 9.22 which doesnt exist?
[05:47] <sethk> jpedroza, you set it up like any other monitor
[05:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about it says .. instalation failed - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:48] <sethk> teenprogrammer, it does, but I forget where.  someone will know.
[05:48] <jpedroza> I have been trying, but the screen is quite red and the images are posterized

[05:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about after that line - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:48] <nomasteryoda> hehe
[05:48] <teenprogrammer> ubot motd
[05:48] <daviddixon> have every possible source added
[05:48] <fluxinator> sethk is there a reason why this is so?
[05:48] <teenprogrammer> :/
[05:49] <jpedroza> sethk: I have tried quite a lot of settings, but they all are really odd looking
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, well then my solution... is the evil automatix

[05:49] <therapy> !motd
[05:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about motd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:49] <daviddixon> can i apt get it?
[05:49] <sethk> fluxinator, the idea that ubuntu doesn't have a root account is utter and complete nonsense.
[05:49] <teenprogrammer> ubot, what is the motd
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, wait
[05:49] <sethk> fluxinator, the amazing thing is that people keep repeating it, as if it were true
[05:49] <therapy> ubotu
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> why not use the mozilla-mplayer?
[05:49] <teenprogrammer> where is the motd ubot
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> it works
[05:49] <nomasteryoda> for firefox too
[05:49] <bimberi> teenprogrammer: /etc/motd
[05:49] <sethk> fluxinator, the root account on ubuntu is exactly like the root account on every other linux and *nix system.
[05:49] <daviddixon> yeah have that installed too
[05:49] <Fireal>  does anyone have a link or mind describing how to have Caps Lock on when you log in?
[05:50] <nomasteryoda> ah, then maybe conflicting with the other one... look into the plugins folder under that /lib subfolder
[05:50] <fluxinator> sethk why does root on my computer have its own password that I have not specified... thats the real point of asking
[05:50] <protocol1> I installed automatix2 and it had everthing i needed for multimedia, java etc
[05:50] <nomasteryoda> leme look
[05:50] <jordan_> fluxinator: To enable a root password run: sudo passwd root
[05:50] <jpedroza> jordan_: I was just going to type that...
[05:50] <sethk> fluxinator, there is an option for setting a password to a value that doesn't match any password you can enter
[05:50] <sethk> fluxinator, it's a method for disabling login
[05:51] <sethk> fluxinator, for the default install, it is used.  for other installs, such as the oem install, you are prompted for the root password
[05:51] <sethk> fluxinator, you can change the root password to a reall one if you like.
[05:51] <fluxinator> sethk in other words, root login has been disabled
[05:52] <alexander> hey everyone
[05:52] <jordan_> fluxinator: In general, the people who care about having a root password know how to enable it.
[05:52] <sethk> fluxinator, right.  the account is normal, but the password has been set with passwd -l
[05:52] <kokey> thanks to all
[05:52] <kokey> bye
[05:52] <fnf> Hi, I'm playing a bit with vmware-player, do you recommend using qemu or vmware server as a host environment for this ?.
[05:52] <fluxinator> jordan_, I was just asking to be on the safe side
[05:53] <fluxinator> thanks sethk
[05:53] <nomasteryoda> daviddixon, i'm using this list ... or here's what I have in mine... the plugin folder... http://pastebin.com/819506
[05:53] <nomasteryoda> totem is there and the plugin
[05:53] <alexander> hey guys, I got a question about ubuntu, is there a way to work with 2 LAN at the same time
[05:53] <alexander> ?
[05:54] <jpedroza> sethk: Now I have a huge screen and have to scroll around by moving the mouse outside the boundaries...
[05:54] <nomasteryoda> alexander, as in bridging them?
[05:54] <nomasteryoda> for a router?
[05:55] <jpedroza> Could this be more of a video card driver than a monitor issue?
[05:55] <CientificoLoco> How can I write in Japanes on firefox messenger openoffice ... ?
[05:55] <fnf> alexander: You need to have two separate network cards for this.
[05:55] <alexander> yep, i got those
[05:55] <daviddixon> i ahve all the mplayer plugins but i think my mplayer is broken
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> apt-get remove mplayer
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> etc... then reinstall it
[05:56] <alexander> how do you address a message to a specific person in this chat? (i am new :( )
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> er, that "etc" means ...
[05:56] <dougsko> anyone know how to get ncurses stuff to display correctly in a screen? ive tried setting the $TERM to rxvt, but no joy
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> =D
[05:56] <powercat> how do I get higher resolution than 1024x768?
[05:56] <bimberi> CientificoLoco: someone asked that previously and was pointed towards "scim"
[05:56] <fnf> alexander: Or setting up a VPN, but this seems to be slightly out of question. Can you play a bit with /etc/network/interfaces ?
[05:56] <crimsun> dougsko: use TERM=vt102 instead.
[05:56] <paras> ubotu, jordan_ flash 9 working by doing manual installation :)
[05:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about jordan_ flash 9 working by doing manual installation :) - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:56] <KakarottoCL> hi!
[05:56] <nomasteryoda> powercat, depends on the video card and monitor
[05:56] <dougsko> crimsun: cool, ill give it a go
[05:56] <paras> ubotu, jordan_ i have sound now
[05:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about jordan_ i have sound now - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:57] <nomasteryoda> powercat, and drivers for the video card
[05:57] <powercat> nomasteryoda: nvidia 6800 gt, viewsonic vp171
[05:57] <jrib> Where would be the right location for documentation about /etc/environment?  Specifcally, the use of $LANGUAGE
[05:57] <jpedroza> is there a specific chanel for ppc-kubuntu?
[05:57] <KakarottoCL> please i need help!
[05:57] <Madpilot> jpedroza, there's #kubuntu
[05:57] <bimberi> alexander: type "bim" (without the "s) and hit the tab key
[05:57] <nomasteryoda> !tell powercat about nvidia
[05:57] <jrib> !ask | KakarottoCL
[05:57] <ubotu> KakarottoCL: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:57] <nomasteryoda> !nvidia
[05:57] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:57] <dougsko> crimsun: lol, that just seems to freeze things up
[05:57] <bimberi> !tab | alexander
[05:57] <ubotu> alexander: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[05:58] <crimsun> dougsko: make sure you're not in scroll lock.
[05:58] <nomasteryoda> tab completion rocks
[05:58] <orville> hi,
[05:58] <nomasteryoda> welcome orville
[05:58] <alexander> bimberi, yay! finnaly... lol....
[05:58] <dougsko> crimsun: no, im good there. maybe vt100?
[05:58] <KakarottoCL> thanks.. well i'm currently using ubuntu 6.06 TLS, but when trying to upgrade to 6.10 (with the ISO burned cd) I get an empty screen after the booter load..
[05:58] <orville> can someone here tell me where I put modules I want loaded at startup in ubuntu?
[05:58] <baxter_kylie> Can anyone tell me if it's possible to fake-eject a cd or dvd rom?
[05:59] <bimberi> alexander: :)
[05:59] <jrib> baxter_kylie: what does that mean?
[05:59] <orville> hi nomasteryoda.
[05:59] <jordan_> baxter_kylie: Like unmount it but not eject it?
[05:59] <Magilla> yay! Dapper -> Edgy upgrade 95% successful
[05:59] <Magilla> :D
[05:59] <baxter_kylie> jrib: I want to auto-run some drive speed utilities but they won't run so long as a disc is in a drive. I want to eject the discs without physically ejecting them.
[05:59] <alexander> fnf, but is it possible in theory or no? like the usage of 2 LANs at the same time?
[06:00] <amax> hello all. People, help me please, I unable to find gconf-sharp package, where I can find it? pleaseeee.
[06:00] <baxter_kylie> jordan_: unmount doesn't work.
[06:00] <baxter_kylie> jordan_: they're already unmounted.
[06:00] <teenprogrammer> whats a good email server application to install on my ubuntu server?
[06:00] <dougsko> crimsun: outside of screen, im using rxvt. so im kinda baffled as to why that wouldnt work in screen too
[06:00] <bimberi> teenprogrammer: dovecot
[06:01] <zenmonk> I have a question, if I type sh in bash, it creates a new sh process, how can I switch between which sh process I am typing in?
[06:01] <jordan_> baxter_kylie: But is that the effect you want, for them to be unmounted but still in the tray.
[06:01] <KakarottoCL> I need help please.. i'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 but when the X is supposed to start, it hangs up.. i get a blank screen even in the Safe Graphics mode!
[06:01] <nomasteryoda> orville, type man modules
[06:01] <AlienX> which library do i need to play m4a or aac files in ubuntu?
[06:01] <dougsko> crimsun: oh well, its late, i appreciate the input though
[06:01] <AlienX> i'm using edgy
[06:01] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, is it a desktop or laptop?
[06:01] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: it is a desktop
[06:01] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: indeed i'm using version 6.06 already without problems..
[06:01] <nomasteryoda> ok, does the video card have a cooling fan?
[06:01] <nomasteryoda> ok
[06:02] <amax> why so hard to find anything for ubuntu? the simple package gconf-sharp is present even under gentoo. but not ubuntu. shame!
[06:02] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: it's not a problem with the video card, it's a radeon 9550
[06:02] <nomasteryoda> well, then there goes that theory
[06:02] <powercat> nomasteryoda: after following the instructions at the site about nvidia drivers, I still can only go up to 1024x768.
[06:02] <alexander> nomasteryoda, hey, you know if there is a way to work of off 2 LAN at the same time?
[06:02] <nomasteryoda> powercat, did you do the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[06:02] <baxter_kylie> jordan_: yes, I'd like to have enough access to run speedcontrol and hdparm -x without the disc leaving the tray. It only has to run at boot.
[06:03] <bimberi> amax: it's called gconf-sharp2 - use synaptic or 'apt-cache search string' or http://packages.ubuntu.com to find packages
[06:03] <nomasteryoda> alexander, i'm looking... i've seen that before... its called teaming in the windows world..
[06:04] <amax> bimberi: not found. did you have it ?
[06:04] <powercat> nomasteryoda: I'll try that. thanks
[06:04] <bimberi> amax: do you have unverse enabled?
[06:04] <bimberi> amax: *universe

[06:04] <ubotu> Package gconf-sharp2 does not exist in any distro I know

[06:06] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Are you at a terminal prompt righ now?
[06:06] <amax> gnome-sharp == gconf-sharp ? hm
[06:06] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: nope, its the same computer that i'm chatting on
[06:06] <crimsun> amax: no.
[06:06] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i would have to restart in order to try anything with the CD
[06:07] <Hansin321> teenprogrammer: I just downloaded Xming and installed.  Looks very cool.  It is based off of the 6.9 code branch of the Xorg server and appears to be actively developed and updated .  It doesn't appear to take too many resources either.
[06:07] <bimberi> amax: there's also gtk-sharp and gtk-sharp2, but no gconf.  Looks like it isn't there.
[06:07] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: You could try the alternate installer.
[06:07] <KakarottoCL> how do I load it?
[06:07] <teenprogrammer> ok
[06:07] <teenprogrammer> cool!
[06:07] <amax> bimberi: I think ew need to create new one..
[06:07] <teenprogrammer> Hasin321 does it go on my server?
[06:08] <amax> to many softfware for mono uses this binding.

=== phpErrror is now known as phpError
[06:08] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: You need to download a different CD.
[06:08] <orville> nomasteryoda: thanks. looks like i was putting it in the right place after all.
[06:08] <jrattner> Question:  When I start up my computer I get the follow error: bcm43xx_microcode5.fw  I think its my wireless card?
[06:08] <teenprogrammer> thanks
[06:08] <Healot> teenprogrammer: book title?
[06:08] <amax> hm.. who is committer for mono packages ?
[06:08] <Hansin321> teenprogrammer: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming
[06:08] <jrattner> i mean, [17180843.288000]  bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed.
[06:08] <Healot> amax: people from Novell?
[06:09] <JDStone1> is google.com working for anyone?
[06:09] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: damn.. i wouldn't like to do that.. i lost two cd's and a dvd because i though they were missburned, but i then runned the CD check option from the menu and it said its fine..
[06:09] <amax> Healot: committer to ubuntu repos
[06:09] <teenprogrammer> google works
[06:09] <JDStone1> hmm
[06:10] <Healot> amax: read the package description then
[06:10] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Did you get an error or a blank screen?
[06:10] <JDStone1> my piece of shit internet
[06:10] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: just a blank screen
[06:10] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i wasn't even able to do alt+ctrl+f1 or so
[06:10] <amax> so we have missed gconf-sharp2.. pity
[06:11] <Hansin321> teenprogrammer: This is the download site (see the other one also).  You want to download the Xming installer and install like any other Windows program on your Windows box.  As far as how you would run programs off of youLinux box on have them display on the Windows X-Server, well I'm not too good at that yet.  But dig around and see what you can learn.  I can tell you that Xming looks good...
[06:11] <Hansin321> ...-- I have run the X-Server off of Cygwin and this is cool that it is stand-alone.  Cygwin is cool also for other reasons...
[06:11] <daviddixon> so why does mplayer require lindirectfb-9.22 and all i can install is 9.24????
[06:11] <josephoenix> So... I read on the forums that vlc in edgy has vc1/wmv9 support linked in, but my wmv9 avis don't play :\
[06:11] <teenprogrammer> ok
[06:11] <teenprogrammer> thanks!
[06:12] <teenprogrammer> I will install XMin
[06:12] <teenprogrammer> g
[06:12] <bimberi> amax: Ubuntu's mono packages have "Ubuntu Core Developers <ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com>" as the maintainer
[06:12] <DeltaF> anyone know how to start evms gui?
[06:12] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: How intent are you in not burning another CD?
[06:12] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: How safe is the alternative installer? is it graphicless?
[06:13] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, works very well
[06:13] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: It is perfectly safe, it is also text based, so yes.
[06:13] <nomasteryoda> and is just the same, but text-based
[06:13] <teenprogrammer> brb
[06:14] <teenprogrammer> have to boot into windows
[06:14] <KakarottoCL> ain't any way to use it with the original cd ?
[06:14] <urmom> hey guys i was thinking of trying ubuntu, i currently have fedora core 6 and i want to dual boot, If i install ubuntu on my empty partition will grub work with both of them out of the box?
[06:14] <sethk> KakarottoCL, it's a curses type interface, if you're familiar with that
[06:14] <sethk> KakarottoCL, it's completely safe
[06:14] <sethk> KakarottoCL, with the current release of ubuntu, and also the immediately preceding release, the text mode install is on the alternate cd
[06:14] <nomasteryoda> and does not boot into live cd mode...that makes the installer less intensive for older computers
[06:15] <KakarottoCL> btw, it seem to be a common bug with Radeon cards..
[06:15] <sethk> KakarottoCL, earlier versions had text and graphical install on the same cd
[06:15] <KakarottoCL> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/67487
[06:15] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: It is hard to tell what problem you are having, there are a few things you could try but it's sort of a stab in the dark.
[06:15] <nomasteryoda> but if you have it online in 6.01, then you can do a dist-upgrae
[06:15] <sethk> nomasteryoda, yes, not to mention those machine where the graphical installer simply won't work.
[06:15] <splintax> favourite thing about ubuntu so far: the "adjust volume" dialog comes up straight away when you click it in the systray. heh.
[06:15] <nomasteryoda> but if you have it online in 6.01, then you can do a dist-upgrade
[06:15] <nomasteryoda> ya
[06:15] <nomasteryoda> like sony 505 series
[06:16] <KakarottoCL> did you both saw the link ?
[06:16] <urmom> so uhh thanks for not helping me guys.,.
[06:16] <sethk> splintax, that's configurable.  (well, not in windows, but in all the varieties of linux and unix)
[06:16] <sethk> urmom, I just got here, what's your question?
[06:16] <KakarottoCL> it seems that other people have had the same problem than me.. look the link i posted before
[06:16] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, hang on
[06:16] <splintax> sethk: in windows there's some bullshit 5 second delay before the thing 'loads'
[06:17] <splintax> sethk: it's buggy as hell, and has been since 295
[06:17] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Did any of them try disabling boot splash?
[06:17] <splintax> **w95
[06:17] <sethk> splintax, yes, true.
[06:17] <urmom> sethk, it doesn't matter anymore, a fedora guy helped me out
[06:17] <sethk> urmom, ok
[06:17] <baxter_kylie> jordan_ & nomasteryoda: No dice. The disc is simply not mounted.
[06:18] <baxter_kylie> jordan_ & nomasteryoda: If the os believes there is a physical disc within the drive it seems to error.
[06:19] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i'm still reading.. no solution yet
[06:19] <tarelerul1> I just got my screen configed the way it should be
[06:20] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: It seems sombody tried my solution and it worked.
[06:20] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, do you have the 6.01 installed on it?
[06:20] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: The new high resolution boot splash in edgy doesn't do whell on newer machines and screw up the tty's
[06:21] <TMX> or on mac
[06:21] <TMX> completely crashes the boot process
[06:21] <TMX> arg stupid  key
[06:21] <factotum> yeah, im pretty happy sticking with 6.06 for a while
[06:21] <factotum> had to many little problems that just got annoying
[06:22] <jordan_> TMX: I am on a macbook pro and it only screws up my tty's
[06:22] <nomasteryoda> using it here.. but edgy on my laptops
[06:22] <factotum> with Edgy anyways
=== lon3lyliv3r is now known as help
[06:22] <TMX> jordan_: macbook non-pro here :)
[06:22] <TMX> on the crappy i810 intel graphics
=== help is now known as lon3lyliv3r
[06:23] <nomasteryoda> TMX, my intel chipset works fine... on a dell
[06:23] <nomasteryoda> =D
[06:23] <nomasteryoda> even beryl works perfect
[06:23] <KakarottoCL> if it is a resolution problem, isn't it fixable?
[06:23] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: What you need to do is when the first menu shows up choose custom ( or whatever it is called ) and delete the word "splash" you should be able to get to a console, from there I have more instructions that might help get X up and running.
[06:23] <teenprogrammer> gmm
[06:23] <teenprogrammer> hmmm*
[06:23] <TMX> beryl works fine
[06:24] <boni> how do make a boot cd frm an iso image can anyone help me with it??
[06:24] <TMX> KakarottoCL, haven got a clue what the problem is, couldn even hazard a guess
[06:24] <teenprogrammer> hwo do i setup xming?
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[06:24] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: are those instructions relative to change the driver to "vesa"?
[06:24] <factotum> the one problem i STILL have is wolfenstien ET, starts up in a window and really really laggy/choppy
[06:24] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, yes that should work... remove quiet and splash
[06:24] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: No, completely seperate.
[06:24] <sethk> boni, is you are in windows, you have to use a program that knows how to write an iso image to a cd.  Nero can do this.  There are free programs available that can do this.
[06:24] <KakarottoCL> i'm guessing the problem is about a 1400x1050 resolution, isn't it?
[06:25] <nomasteryoda> nope
[06:25] <sethk> boni, windows itself, I'm told, cannot do it, at least "out of the box."
[06:25] <nomasteryoda> my laptop has that and is fine
[06:25] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Actually it is about newer BIOS's.
[06:25] <nomasteryoda> i think it's the video card setup... in the bios
[06:25] <KakarottoCL> how could i try to fix it by the nice way?
[06:25] <nomasteryoda> http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=751&slide=4&title=ubuntu+6.10+screenshots
[06:25] <sethk> KakarottoCL, there is no problem using 1400x1050 with ubuntu, if (of course) the graphics adapter and monitor support it.
[06:25] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: What do you mean "nice way" ?
[06:25] <nomasteryoda> you should press F6
[06:26] <TMX> I sure itl be fixed by
[06:26] <nomasteryoda> on the installer
[06:26] <KakarottoCL> I mean without altering the Xorg config
[06:26] <jrib> Where would be the right location for documentation about /etc/environment?  Specifcally, the use of $LANGUAGE
[06:26] <TMX> i'm sure it'll be fixed by 7.4 anyway :D
[06:26] <KakarottoCL> hahahahah
[06:26] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, when it is installed it will work...
[06:26] <nomasteryoda> just edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove "splash"
[06:26] <boni> sethk: No I dont use windows I use Dapper I know its using cdrecord but I am not sure can you give me a link or help me out how to use cdrecord??
[06:27] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: The instructions I will give will install the fglrx drivers from the command line, but there is no manual xorg editing required.
[06:27] <KakarottoCL> but what i'm supposed to do after the X hangs again? (having the loader without the quiet and splash lines)?
[06:27] <kuzmaster> hey all
[06:27] <sethk> boni, with an iso file, on my box, I just use     cdrecord -vv iso-file-name
[06:27] <sethk> boni, the -vv just makes it talk more as it burns
[06:27] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: ok, i won't interrupt you, go ahead
[06:27] <nomasteryoda> without the splash, it won't hang...
[06:27] <jordan_> nomasteryoda: But X will still fail.
[06:27] <sethk> boni, On my ubuntu boxes the sym link to the cd writer is set up automatically during install, so that cdrecord "just works"
[06:27] <nomasteryoda> ok
[06:28] <sethk> boni, if your cd writer was installed when you installed ubuntu, that should be true for you as well.
[06:28] <nomasteryoda> guys, that is an old laptop
[06:28] <sethk> boni, try it.  The worst thing that can happen is that it won't work.
[06:29] <boni> sethk: Thanx but dont you need to give the device id by finding it from scanbus??
[06:29] <sethk> boni, no
[06:29] <asparagui> how long till fiesty knot 1?
[06:29] <nomasteryoda> i have a latitude from 2005 and its fine...
[06:29] <sethk> boni, because the default is to use the symlink to the cd writer
[06:29] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: so?
[06:29] <sethk> boni, you can override the default, of course, but there usually is no need to.
[06:29] <Flannel> asparagui: Feisty Herd 1 is set for Nov 30ish - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule
[06:30] <teenprogrammer> i am not getting Xming to work
[06:30] <boni> sethk: Ok I will try it out I guess my default will work as well
[06:30] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: I am going to pastebin the instructions when I am done, unless you want to here it step by step as I go, which is fine too.
[06:30] <nomasteryoda> http://www.geocities.com/acarirfan/inspiron-1150.html
[06:30] <nomasteryoda> is that not your laptop?
[06:30] <sethk> boni, give it a try.  older versions of cdrecord weren't quite so smart, but recent versions usually work this way.
[06:30] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: yeah I would like the step by step
[06:30] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i'll go taking note along the way
[06:30] <kuzmaster> what is the terminal comma for opening a text file
[06:31] <sethk> boni, and of course you can always use scanbus to figure out the device.  but you have to use an option with scanbus to tell it you want the IDE mode, not the scsi emulation mode, and the syntax is a bit odd.
[06:31] <kuzmaster> such as opening my sources.list files
[06:31] <nomasteryoda> kuzmaster, nano filename
[06:31] <kuzmaster> thanx
[06:31] <nomasteryoda> kuzmaster, or vi filename
[06:31] <sethk> kuzmaster, more, less, vi, nano, emacs, lots of options
[06:31] <nomasteryoda> sudo if you want to save it...
[06:31] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: First run: sudo software-properties -e restriced
[06:32] <nomasteryoda> sudo nano filename... nano is easier to understand kuzmaster
=== First|Bleh is now known as FirstStrike
[06:33] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Sorry, my DNS resolutions are taking 10 + seconds so googleing for specifics like package names is taking a while.
[06:33] <teenprogrammer> how do i setup ftp on an ubuntu server?
[06:34] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: ok, don't worry.. I would thank anything you do for me, no matter how long it takes
[06:34] <asparagui> flannel: k, thx.
[06:34] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: do you know how do this guy uses these windows-like fonts in this screenshot?? http://img74.imageshack.us/my.php?image=pantallazo7fe.png
[06:35] <nomasteryoda> sure
[06:35] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Then: sudo apt-get update then: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic xorg-driver-fglrx
[06:36] <kuzmaster> grrrrrrrr.........
[06:36] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i do that in the console after X crash?
[06:36] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Then: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh ( choose fglrx when asked what driver to use )
[06:36] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL,  sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[06:37] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Yes.
[06:37] <kuzmaster> oops
[06:37] <kuzmaster> sudo fixes all
[06:37] <nomasteryoda> =D
[06:37] <kuzmaster> ;)
[06:37] <teenprogrammer> so is setting up ftp on ubuntu easy?
[06:37] <kissfire> hellow !
[06:37] <bimberi> !ftp
[06:38] <ubotu> FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: ftpd, proftpd, pure-ftpd, twoftpd, vsftpd
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> kissfire, howdy
[06:38] <teenprogrammer> ftp host
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> wow, 899KB/sec dl
[06:38] <jordan_> Then: "sudo gdm" and everything should work, should being the imparative word ;)
[06:38] <sethk> teenprogrammer, they are all ftp hosts
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> man, smokin
[06:38] <kuzmaster> anyway, does ubuntu have a wifi utility like kubutu does?
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> gnome-network-manager... install that kuzmaster
[06:38] <jordan_> kuzmaster: Yes, network-manager-gnome
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> yea, that
[06:38] <nomasteryoda> oops
[06:38] <shrndegruv> hey im thinking of trying ubuntu -- been using gentoo for a while
[06:39] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: i'm taking note :D
[06:39] <kuzmaster> thanx
[06:39] <shrndegruv> was wondering what people recommended for fs type and starting partitions
[06:39] <sethk> teenprogrammer, the reason there are so many is that the FTP protocol itself is a disaster, from a security perspective, and there are many attempts to ammeliorate this, with varying degrees of success.
[06:39] <nomasteryoda> ext3 is my preference
[06:39] <charle97> i like rieserfs
[06:39] <sethk> teenprogrammer, sftp, secure ftp, is better.  However, it is frequently necessary to support ftp for file downloading
[06:39] <shrndegruv> also dapper or 6.10
[06:39] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Now the other thing is that you will need to be connected to the internet so be hard wired just to make things easier.
[06:40] <nomasteryoda> i used to do /boot "/" and "/home"... and swap
[06:40] <charle97> 6.10
[06:40] <nomasteryoda> now i just do root, home and swap
[06:40] <bimberi> ext3, with "/" and swap
[06:40] <shrndegruv> thats what i usually do nomasteryoda
[06:40] <shrndegruv> should i add any others?
[06:40] <nomasteryoda> if you want
[06:40] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Now try it and I hope the next time you come back it will be from the LiveCD :)
[06:40] <sethk> there is really not significant advantage to having more than one partition.
[06:40] <shrndegruv> well is there a practical reason to?
[06:40] <spiderworm> anyone know if there's something i can put into a /usr/share/xsessions/ file to disable DPMS for that session type?
[06:40] <nomasteryoda> but not necessary depends on your drive space...
[06:40] <shrndegruv> gentoo recommends a partition for the portage system
[06:40] <shrndegruv> for example
[06:40] <sethk> shrndegruv, no. hasn't been for quite a few years
[06:40] <nomasteryoda> say for apache
[06:41] <shrndegruv> is there an equivalent on ubuntu
[06:41] <sethk> shrndegruv, that's gentoo nonsense
[06:41] <bimberi> 6.10 has been good for me
[06:41] <nomasteryoda> put the var on separate
[06:41] <sethk> shrndegruv, is there a package manager?  yes, dpkg
[06:41] <shrndegruv> nono
[06:41] <sethk> shrndegruv, but there is no reason to devote a partition to that, or to portage or anything of that sort
[06:41] <shrndegruv> is there an ubuntu specific reason to have other than /boot / and /home
[06:41] <shrndegruv> and /swap
[06:41] <charle97> no
[06:41] <sethk> shrndegruv, there is no reason to have separate /boot and /home
[06:41] <shrndegruv> ok
[06:41] <charle97> shrndevgruv, conventional linux setup
[06:42] <nomasteryoda> shrndegruv, if you've done gentoo, this will be a breeze
[06:42] <sethk> shrndegruv, /swap is a different animal, although many machines these days have so much memory that the swap is never really used.
[06:42] <shrndegruv> how much swap for a gig of ram?
[06:42] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: thousands of thanks for you, dude.. I hope so too.. I will reconnect in a few minutes to tell you the results, hope you're still online then
[06:42] <bimberi> shrndegruv: nope, "/" and swap is just what the installer does and has been good for me
[06:42] <nomasteryoda> swap is used for resume from hibernate
[06:42] <charle97> shrndevgruv, 1 gig swap
[06:42] <sethk> shrndegruv, the idea that the amount of ram indicates some amount of swap is about 25 years old and 15 years out of date
[06:42] <shrndegruv> well i want to keep /home separate in case reinstlal needed
[06:42] <sethk> shrndegruv, you probably need no swap at all.
[06:42] <nomasteryoda> good idea
[06:42] <shrndegruv> yes this is a laptop
[06:42] <bimberi> shrndegruv: and that's fine
[06:42] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: I will be, then we will need to make sure it will work on the install too :)
[06:42] <charle97> shrndevgrux, you probably can get away with 500MB
[06:42] <shrndegruv> so will need to resume from hibernate
[06:42] <sethk> shrndegruv, having /home separate does not make reinstalling easier, or more difficult.  the /home partition can always be renamed
[06:43] <KakarottoCL> yeah :D
[06:43] <nomasteryoda> shrndegruv, having a swap for the hibernate function is good though
[06:43] <gyaresu> charle97, stop making up numbers about RAM.
[06:43] <sethk> shrndegruv, and having a separate /home reduces flexibility.  but I suppose it won't really hurt too much.
[06:43] <shrndegruv> yeah but so i dont lose all my data files sethk
[06:43] <KakarottoCL> well, getting offline for now.. i will try all this ^^
[06:43] <KakarottoCL> cya!
[06:43] <shrndegruv> music vids etc
[06:43] <nomasteryoda> shrndegruv, note, the Ubuntu edgy now uses UUID instead of conventional /dev/hdx
[06:43] <sethk> shrndegruv, you wouldn't lose all your data files.  that's the whole point.
[06:43] <nomasteryoda> in the fstab
[06:43] <charle97> gyaresu, i'm basing my numbers off my experience
[06:43] <shrndegruv> really?
[06:43] <sethk> shrndegruv, you don't need a separate /home partition to not lose your data files.
[06:43] <nomasteryoda> ya
[06:43] <shrndegruv> uisually on install they reformat the partitions
[06:43] <sethk> shrndegruv, not unless you tell them to
[06:44] <gyaresu> charle97, with 2GB of ram eh? You needed swap did you ?
[06:44] <nomasteryoda> ya, ubuntu is safer
[06:44] <charle97> gyaresu, no
[06:44] <sethk> shrndegruv, I rename all my directories, do an install, then I have my entire old system and my entire new system.
[06:44] <shrndegruv> i see seth
[06:44] <sethk> shrndegruv, carying over an older /home, or a /home from a different distro, almost always causes nasty problems.
[06:44] <shrndegruv> cool -- so for resume from hibernate i need at least as much swap as ram?
[06:44] <sethk> charle97, I would be willing to bet a lot that your swap has never been used.
[06:45] <sethk> shrndegruv, no, hibernate doesn't use swap
[06:45] <shrndegruv> ok
[06:45] <charle97> sethk, in ubuntu it has
[06:45] <shrndegruv> goodie
[06:45] <gyaresu> sethk, shrndegruv I just kept my home partition from (2yrs install) of gentoo. hosed the rest and installed ubuntu. nothing bad happened.
[06:45] <charle97> sethk, in slackware no
[06:45] <sethk> shrndegruv, hibernate can't use swap; if it did, you wouldn't be able to swap.
[06:45] <sethk> shrndegruv, swap is only needed to extend memory.
[06:45] <shrndegruv> ok so ill do 500mb swap
[06:45] <shrndegruv> i only have 20 gigs
[06:45] <shrndegruv> so i want to minimize stuff like that
[06:45] <nomasteryoda> er, on mine my resume partition is my swap..
[06:46] <sethk> shrndegruv, remember, you can add swap space in the normal file system, should you ever actually need swap
[06:46] <nomasteryoda> that is what last ubuntu used
[06:46] <shrndegruv> from what i understand ubuntu brings in compile binaries right??
[06:46] <sethk> shrndegruv, it's much slower that way, but since it probably won't be used, the speed doesn't matter much.
[06:46] <sethk> shrndegruv, correct
[06:46] <teenprogrammer> i just installed vsftpd
[06:46] <sethk> shrndegruv, you can install source if you like, but that's not the usual thing to do.
[06:46] <shrndegruv> right
[06:46] <sethk> teenprogrammer, ok, that's a good choice.
[06:46] <shrndegruv> for things like mozilla id prefer bins
[06:46] <shrndegruv> updating a gentoo system is a pain ;)
[06:46] <sethk> shrndegruv, and you don't have to compile for three days.  :)
[06:47] <shrndegruv> plus i like to try new things
=== foolswisdom is now known as fool|Zzz
[06:47] <shrndegruv> if i got xgl going on gentoo should be able to handle it on gentoo
[06:47] <shrndegruv> i mean ubuntu
[06:47] <sethk> shrndegruv, sure.
[06:47] <teenprogrammer> how do i configure vsftpd?
[06:47] <gyaresu> teenprogrammer, man vsftpd
[06:47] <sethk> shrndegruv, I have four different distros installed on various machines.  The only one I obliterated is gentoo.  :)
[06:47] <jordan_> shrndegruv: I tried to get XGL working in gentoo, that was a nightmare.
[06:47] <shrndegruv> beryl wont work with ati, correct?
[06:47] <gyaresu> teenprogrammer, specific questions are better than generic ones.
[06:48] <teenprogrammer> ok
[06:48] <teenprogrammer> lol
[06:48] <jordan_> shrndegruv: Yes, it will work.
[06:48] <teenprogrammer> sorry :/
[06:48] <shrndegruv> i like gentoo seth ;)
[06:48] <shrndegruv> just want to try new things
[06:48] <shrndegruv> and want easier updating on my laptop
[06:48] <sethk> shrndegruv, I know, a lot of people do.  Go figure.  :)
[06:48] <sethk> shrndegruv, I've found ubuntu to be excellent on laptops, has good wireless support
[06:48] <shrndegruv> its great if you want a highly configurable system
[06:48] <nomasteryoda> and deb repos are super
[06:48] <sethk> shrndegruv, every linux system is precisely as configurable as any other.
[06:48] <shrndegruv> not if you want a highly usable and up to date system
[06:48] <shrndegruv> ;)
[06:49] <britt> if i have a non-ht p4, which kernel do i use?
[06:49] <shrndegruv> sure
[06:49] <sethk> britt, i486, I think
[06:49] <shrndegruv> but if i am going to configure a ton of use flags in ubuntu, i have to get the source and go thru the config
[06:49] <morphish> britt: generic, everyone uses generic, unless you build your own
[06:49] <sethk> britt, maybe 686, I have to check.
[06:49] <sethk> morphir, there's a 686 kernel in the repos.
[06:49] <morphish> shrndegruv: "use flags" is a very gentoo centric way of thinking
[06:50] <shrndegruv> true
[06:50] <shrndegruv> habit
[06:50] <shrndegruv> ;)
[06:50] <sethk> morphir, some people use it.  I have found the performance difference is about zero, though
[06:50] <morphir> huh?
[06:50] <morphish> shrndegruv: try www.sourcemage.org not gentoo and still sourcebased, and no they have no use flags either
[06:50] <morphish> morphir: he means me
[06:50] <spiderworm> anyone know if there's something i can put into a /usr/share/xsessions/ file to disable DPMS for that session type?
[06:50] <sethk> shrndegruv, I do build from source in certain cases, when I need to.  I don't need the package manager to do it, though.
[06:51] <morphir> I understand that :D
[06:51] <britt> yeah the 686 kernel
[06:51] <britt> there are 2 of them
[06:51] <sethk> morphir, sorry if I tab completed you by mistake.  :)
[06:51] <shrndegruv> so 6.10 or 6.0.6
[06:51] <morphish> i think this is a cue and i should go build me a kernel here now
[06:51] <shrndegruv> ?
[06:51] <charle97> 6.10
[06:51] <jordan_> shrndegruv: 6.10
[06:51] <shrndegruv> im weary of the upstart stuff
[06:51] <sethk> morphish, I build kernels all the time.  but that's because I port linux to embedded hardware for a living.  :)
[06:51] <LGKeiz-Windows> 6.10 -> 6.06 personall
[06:51] <LGKeiz-Windows> y
[06:51] <shrndegruv> is it much different from init?
[06:51] <sethk> shrndegruv, init isn't gentoo specific.
[06:52] <jordan_> shrndegruv: It is backwards compatable.
[06:52] <LGKeiz-Windows> Edgy is freaking quick and I love the new login screen and things like that
[06:52] <shrndegruv> i know
[06:52] <shrndegruv> but 6.06 uses init right?
[06:52] <morphish> shrndegruv: 6.10 if your test new / is on a logical partition scrape the Desktop CD download and start a alternative cd download (textinstaller)
[06:52] <shrndegruv> 6.10 upstart
[06:52] <shrndegruv> i didnt understand that morphish
[06:52] <Akuma_> what's a 'dependency package' ?
[06:52] <morphish> sethk: then how come you are not in #gentoo-embedded? ;)
[06:52] <KakarottoCL> hey
[06:53] <sethk> morphish, because I know what I'm doing, I don't need gentoo.
[06:53] <jordan_> shrndegruv: And if you have an intel or Nvidia graphics card setting up beryl + AIGLX is serioulsy a few mintues of simple setup.
[06:53] <sethk> morphish, if you do want an embedded distro, look at snapgear
[06:53] <KakarottoCL> jordan_
[06:53] <shrndegruv> gentoo seems like a distro to use only if you know what you are doing
[06:53] <shrndegruv> :|
[06:53] <gyaresu> Akuma_, You're missing a requirement for the  package you are attempting to install.
[06:53] <KakarottoCL> it didn't work :(
[06:53] <KakarottoCL> wait
[06:53] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Did you get to a terminal prompt at least?
[06:53] <shrndegruv> ati jordan :(
[06:54] <morphish> shrndegruv: if your / is not a primary partition the installer will not work, is all i meant
[06:54] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: it didn't work for me.. the system hangs up with and without the "quiet splash" line
[06:54] <shrndegruv> oh fudge i dont know
[06:54] <shrndegruv> that could be an issue
[06:55] <morphish> sethk: i find gentoo to be a nice distro to build a rootfs with (then again i don't do it for a living) but i have not found any other distro to be so easy for building a rootfs (from a cross compile point of view) as gentoo
[06:55] <Akuma_> gyaresu: acutally, i'm not getting it as an error, i'm just wondering what it means, it sometimes says 'this package is a dependency package' in the description section .. i'm just curious. and google didnt satisfy my curiosity.
[06:55] <sethk> morphish, have you looked at snapgear?
[06:55] <teenprogrammer> trying to be a bit mroe specific ... xD ... Shouldnt the apache2 folder be /usr/local/www/data ?
[06:55] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, i tried to ask... DO you have the Ubuntu 6.01 disk?.... can't you try to upgrade from that install?
[06:55] <morphish> sethk: nope, as a matter of fact, you are the first to mention it
[06:55] <dope> i can't seem to control the bass of my audio.  the bass slider doesn't do anything.  can someone suggest something?
[06:55] <gyaresu> Akuma_, Specifically I don't know. I assume it's a library or similar.
[06:56] <nomasteryoda> teenprogrammer, nope... /var/
[06:56] <teenprogrammer> to store my website files?
[06:56] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: i have the 6.06 disc, does it works in anyway to upgrade?
[06:56] <nomasteryoda> down under there teenprogrammer
[06:56] <sethk> morphish, it's worth a look if you do embedded stuff, or even if you are interested in embedded stuff.
[06:56] <shrndegruv> how long does it take to install ubuntu?
[06:56] <morphish> sethk: and ever since my usb2 enclosure died the nslu2 is more of a toy now, before it served anything i needed, should i revive it and not sell it (like i plan on doing right now) i will checkout snapgear
[06:56] <charle97> 30 minutes
[06:56] <charle97> for me
[06:56] <nomasteryoda> shrndegruv, ya
[06:56] <jordan_> shrndegruv: 10 min.
[06:56] <nomasteryoda> faster pc, 10 min
[06:56] <shrndegruv> i dont believe you jordan :)
[06:57] <sethk> shrndegruv, depends on the hardware of course, but it takes me around 20 minutes, end to end.
[06:57] <nomasteryoda> no really
[06:57] <jordan_> shrndegruv: You will.
[06:57] <nomasteryoda> i've done it on 2 newer dells
[06:57] <shrndegruv> 1.5 ghz pentium something
[06:57] <charlie5> !swap
[06:57] <ubotu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[06:57] <morphish> shrndegruv: guess, 30-45 was somewhere in tthat time fram on this duron 1.3ghz
[06:57] <nomasteryoda> !tell KakarottoCL about upgrade
[06:57] <shrndegruv> alright i try it now;)
[06:57] <charlie5> sorry ... shoulda priv mess'g that
[06:57] <nomasteryoda> !upgrade
[06:57] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[06:57] <shrndegruv> lemme find the 6.10 disk
[06:58] <shrndegruv> can i go from 6.10 to 6.06 if i want?
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> yes
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> slower, butyes
[06:58] <morphish> shrndegruv: not supported
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> i did it fine...
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> had to on an old laptop
[06:58] <shrndegruv> my laptop is pretty fast
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> was only way to get here...
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> good
[06:58] <shrndegruv> not blazing but never had a problem with it
[06:58] <morphish> nomasteryoda: not that i tried it, but the official stance is it is not suppported afaik
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> right
[06:58] <nomasteryoda> i know
[06:59] <jordan_> !downgrade
[06:59] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[06:59] <morphish> nomasteryoda: wifi issues?
[06:59] <nomasteryoda> i'm on my own anyway...nope
[06:59] <nomasteryoda> perfect
[06:59] <shrndegruv> will it handle X stuff in the install?
[06:59] <jordan_> shrndegruv: yup
[06:59] <morphish> nomasteryoda: no i meant what made you downgrade
[06:59] <nomasteryoda> but i have to enter my password to get into my own secured wifi
[06:59] <splintax> How can I move GRUB to a different hard disk?
[06:59] <nomasteryoda> and that is ok
[06:59] <shrndegruv> will i be able to read my windows partitions by default?
[06:59] <nomasteryoda> morphish, i did not downgrade... did upgrade
[06:59] <morphish> shrndegruv: yes
[06:59] <gyaresu> splintax, 'sudo grub-install /dev/otherhdd

[06:59] <shrndegruv> sweeeeeeet
[07:00] <shrndegruv> its going
[07:00] <morphish> nomasteryoda: ohhhh <shrndegruv> can i go from 6.10 to 6.06 if i want? <nomasteryoda> yes
[07:00] <nomasteryoda> shrndegruv, you will be very happy with it...
[07:00] <splintax> gyaresu: and is there something i need to do to deinstall it from the disk it's currently on
[07:00] <shrndegruv> figure its now or never
[07:00] <shrndegruv> now for getting software
[07:00] <nomasteryoda> er, nope... not done that before morphir
[07:00] <nomasteryoda> sh
[07:00] <nomasteryoda> oops
[07:00] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: I have the desktop, not the install cd
[07:00] <nomasteryoda> ok
[07:00] <shrndegruv> does it detect your settings (like cpu) and download appropriately, or just get x86 compatible bins?
[07:00] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: and i have no intentions to download another one
[07:01] <gyaresu> splintax, no. just make the other drive the first to boot. (you can DD the first 513KB but lets not get into that)
[07:01] <KakarottoCL> it would help to get the console working
[07:01] <nomasteryoda> KakarottoCL, no if you have 6.01 it has the installer onit
[07:01] <morphish> shrndegruv: x86 bins for you, the exact optimization i am not sure about
[07:01] <KakarottoCL> if just were a way to stop GDM loading
[07:01] <nomasteryoda> for that version
[07:01] <nomasteryoda> sure
[07:01] <teenprogrammer> how cna i see all the daemons running?
[07:01] <splintax> gyaresu: how do i know what 'otherhdd' should be? i think it's sda1, but i'm not sure.
[07:01] <nomasteryoda> change it to init3
[07:01] <nomasteryoda> just sec
[07:01] <splintax> gyaresu: i want to install to the disk that holds the partition linux is currently installed on
[07:01] <shrndegruv> taking a while to ask me anything, the instlal is...
[07:01] <gyaresu> splintax, 'fdisk -l'
[07:01] <KakarottoCL> nomasteryoda: yes but i have the 6.06 which, as the website tells, has it by separate
[07:02] <Olathe> How do I get the kernel for the K7 architecture installed and usable ?  I already have the linux-image-k7 package, but k7 isn't in grub.
[07:02] <teenprogrammer> nvm
[07:02] <Thanos> hi guys i have a noob problem can someone help me out?
[07:02] <gyaresu> splintax, the disk NOT the partition (hda,sda,sdd... whatever)
[07:02] <splintax> gyaresu: thanks
[07:02] <morphish> KakarottoCL: the desktop cd has a Install icon on desktop
[07:02] <splintax> gyaresu: that explains a lot as well
[07:02] <charle97> thanos, just ask
[07:02] <bimberi> Olathe: edgy?
[07:02] <gyaresu> splintax, your questions are good :)
[07:02] <Olathe> bimberi: Yep.
[07:03] <nomasteryoda> Thanos, ask away
[07:03] <bimberi> !linux-image-k7
[07:03] <ubotu> linux-image-k7: Obsoleted by: linux-image-generic. In component main, is optional. Version 2.6.17.10 (edgy), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[07:03] <shrndegruv> wow
[07:03] <splintax> gyaresu: so sda means the first SATA, sdb would be the second SATA, and sda1 sda2 and sda3 would be the partitions on sda
[07:03] <shrndegruv> it plays music
[07:03] <morphish> woot, apt knows ketchup!
[07:03] <shrndegruv> i guess that means my soundcard will work by default
[07:03] <charle97> slintax, yes
[07:03] <bimberi> Olathe: linux-image-k7 - "Obsoleted by: linux-image-generic"
[07:03] <nomasteryoda> lol
[07:03] <morphish> shrndegruv: it is a one size fits all kernel, if it's supported by linux, chances are the module i built for you
[07:03] <splintax> gyaresu: thanks. i do support on other channels for windows and some software, so i know how much of a PITA it is supporting people who can't be arsed learning what they're doing anyway. i'm also a general windows consultant person
[07:03] <splintax> charle97: thanks.
[07:04] <Thanos> well i have just installed unbuntu 6.06 and i can ping the lan and websites but i can't see them
[07:04] <bimberi> Olathe: so there won't be an new grub entry created.  you would have -generic already
[07:04] <Olathe> Alright.  What is the proper method of getting the K7 kernel working ?
[07:04] <KakarottoCL> morphish:i just can't reach the desktop, the system hangs when X starts up
[07:04] <splintax> back in a bit, rebooting
[07:04] <KakarottoCL> I need to stop X loading in the live cd !
[07:04] <charle97> top
[07:04] <charle97> oops
[07:05] <teenprogrammer> where is the apache2 config file?
=== charles_ is now known as CEWE_ALIM
[07:05] <bimberi> teenprogrammer: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
[07:06] <morphish> KakarottoCL: just on the mneu check options, i have not needed it, but most livecd come with a option to not boot X,<nomasteryoda> change it to init3
[07:06] <morphish> maybe that was for you
[07:06] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: If you want to be really adventurous you could try entering the commands I gave you and hope they work :)
[07:06] <gyaresu> teenprogrammer, man httpd.conf
[07:07] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: which ones? I can't get the console working!!
[07:07] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: THere is a chance that you just can't see it.
[07:07] <shrndegruv> if i have 20gb and am going to have a separate /home, how much should i give home and root
[07:07] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: even without "quiet splash", the X tries to start and then the whole system hangs.. I can't do ctrl+alt+f1 or any tty..
[07:08] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: what is that chance?
[07:08] <Thanos> :/
[07:08] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: please enlight my way!
[07:08] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, I'm using 5.6GB of / and have many progs installed
[07:08] <shrndegruv> guys how much do i  need to give root to have plenty of room for all the apps i could wnat
[07:08] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: I did it a few times when my tty's wouldn't show up.
[07:08] <crass> does anyone know the line I need to put into the sources.list to access the debian unstable repository?
[07:08] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, I have fluxbox && kde installed but no gnome.
[07:09] <shrndegruv> im going to use gnome (compiz) and e17
[07:09] <Ayabara> I have a problem the someone told me is common. After I have been in xp, grub won't work. Is there a patch/solution to this?
[07:09] <gyaresu> !repos > crass
[07:09] <morphish> shrndegruv: /dev/hda3              19G  4.5G   13G  26% /  and that is with everything i need and stuff apt leaves behind like a ton of .deb (like a 500MB+ worth of distfiles and the like)
[07:09] <shrndegruv> so i need about 19gb for root?
[07:10] <shrndegruv> :(
[07:10] <shrndegruv> only have 20 gb
[07:10] <shrndegruv> i thik
[07:10] <morphish> shrndegruv: no i use 4.5 out of 19
[07:10] <shrndegruv> i wish gpartd would give me the partition names
[07:10] <shrndegruv> ooohhhh
[07:10] <shrndegruv> ok
[07:10] <shrndegruv> good
[07:10] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, no. he's using 4.5. mine is 5.4GB
[07:10] <shrndegruv> ill do / 7
[07:10] <shrndegruv> home /12
[07:10] <shrndegruv> lemme start over
[07:10] <morphish> shrndegruv: should be under 4 if i clean it up, i do have clutter everywhere
[07:10] <shrndegruv> ill give root 6
[07:10] <shrndegruv> home 12
[07:10] <shrndegruv> 1 swap
[07:10] <shrndegruv> and 100 mb to boot
[07:11] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: But there is a command you could use to check if what you are typing is doing anything type: yes "test" > /dev/dsp and if it worked you should hear a load noise which you can stop with ctrl + c
[07:11] <mia> hey all whats the quickest way to get ntfs write support?  do i need to recompile my kernel?
[07:11] <jordan_> !ntfs
[07:11] <ubotu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:11] <crass> gyaresu: so does that mean that I can't? (because debian uses a different components system)
[07:11] <jordan_> !fuse
[07:11] <ubotu> Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[07:11] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: great
[07:11] <Thanos> just installed ubuntu and my internet connection is real unstable
[07:11] <Feonix762> Quick question.. I installed Ubuntu on a laptop and then later installed Windows XP on a seperate partition and it overwrote the boot loader.. what is the easiest way for me to restore it so I can boot linux again? I don't have my Ubuntu CD at the moment either so I can't use it to get into linux.. is there some other method I can use to start up linux so I can restore GRUB?
[07:11] <BHSPitLappy> actually, I heard nothing but positive results about ntfs-3g
[07:11] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, morphish I just ran 'apt-get clean'. Now I'm using 4.4GB (down from 5.4) :)
[07:12] <BHSPitLappy> has anyone heard of a ntfs-3g mishap?
[07:12] <shrndegruv> 40 mb should be enough for /boot right?
[07:12] <Ayabara> anyone else have the problem that grub restarts the pc in a dual boot system?
[07:12] <shrndegruv> crap
[07:12] <shrndegruv> serious stuff
[07:12] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: so if that works, which would mean the console is working, would i be able to kill the X ?
[07:12] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, for how many OSes?
[07:12] <shrndegruv> dont want to screw up my windows
[07:12] <morphish> gyaresu: i should try that when ketchup is done downloading kernel tree
[07:12] <shrndegruv> just ubuntu
[07:12] <shrndegruv> (windows gets most of the drive, for now
[07:12] <jordan_> KakarottoCL: Yes.
[07:12] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, uhh, then why the heck are you making a /boot partition??
[07:12] <gyaresu> crass, What are you trying to install that is only available for debian?
[07:13] <shrndegruv> my linux stuff is in /dev/sda4
[07:13] <shrndegruv> extended
[07:13] <KakarottoCL> jordan_: whose command would be being "killall -9 X" ?
[07:13] <shrndegruv> right now i have 40 for boot
[07:13] <shrndegruv> 1 gig for swap
=== jordan_ is now known as Jordan_U
[07:13] <shrndegruv> and 20 for the rest
[07:13] <shrndegruv> i want to take that 20 and make it a / and a /home
[07:13] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, but ---why--- do you think you need a /boot partition
[07:13] <crass> gyaresu: its actually the version, I'm looking for rtorrent 0.6.4
[07:13] <morphish> shrndegruv: if / is on a extended partition the GUI installer might not work, which is what i said earlier
[07:13] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: What do you mean?
[07:13] <shrndegruv> hmm
[07:13] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: same reason why people think they NEED a /home or a /usr or a /var
[07:13] <Feonix762> How can I start Ubuntu if the boot loader was overwriten by Windows XP and I don't have my Ubuntu CD?
[07:14] <splintax> gyaresu: i have more questions :P
[07:14] <KakarottoCL> Jordan_U: the command to kill the X should be "killall -9 X" ?
[07:14] <shrndegruv> how do i get around that morph
[07:14] <splintax> gyaresu: i was able to get GRUB to come up, but the configuration was incorrect
[07:14] <crass> gyaresu: I have no problems compiling it myself, but I'd prefer to do it through the package management system
[07:14] <gyaresu> crass, :) I use 0.5.3 |tried upgrading with the source. didn't work though.
[07:14] <splintax> gyaresu: are hd0, hd1, hd2 etc. the hard disks in BIOS boot order or what?
[07:14] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, /home is valid, this /boot isn't!
[07:14] <KakarottoCL> ok i will try immediatly, at least the /dev/dsp thing
[07:14] <morphish> Feonix762: burn another cd, or use another cd like knoppix, anything with grub on it to rewrite grub to mbr
[07:14] <gyaresu> crass, download it and dpkg then (not recommended)
[07:14] <splintax> gyaresu: i could only boot into ubuntu by changing it to boot into hd0 instead of hd1 as it was set up.
[07:14] <crass> gyaresu: yeah, I use that version too, but the developer says its got serious issues
[07:15] <Feonix762> morphish.. if I use a live CD of knoppix can I reinstall GRUB that way?
[07:15] <gyaresu> splintax, you will need to edit your menu.lst (you can just do it on the fly with grub. that's one of the cool things about it)
[07:15] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: often people have a seperate /boot to keepp it umounted and thus not be affected by system crashes for example
[07:15] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, I'm just going to go ahead and tell you right now, that you don't need a /boot partition.  PLUS, since you're limited on space, I don't even recommend splitting up into / and /home.
[07:15] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, bah.
[07:15] <crass> gyaresu: so you're saying that I can't use debian unstable then?
[07:15] <splintax> gyaresu: that's how i was able to boot up. i edited it on the fly - however, i wasn't able to get the changes to stay
[07:15] <BHSPitLappy> humbug, I say!
[07:15] <gyaresu> splintax, hda hdb yes ide positions.
[07:15] <splintax> gyaresu: i had to edit it then press 'b' to boot
[07:15] <ptaylor> shrndegruv: my boot partition only had 20megs or so used
[07:15] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: You probalby won't need the -9 , and when you need to restart X you can always just go back with ctrl+option+F7 and do ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X.
[07:15] <morphish> Feonix762: only if you have it id say use that, if not get yourself a spiffy ubuntu CD
[07:15] <ptaylor> 20 would prob be fine
[07:15] <ptaylor> 40 that is
[07:16] <gyaresu> crash don't use debian repos.
[07:16] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: ok, so you disagree, no need to bah me when i try to explain why people like to have a /boot
[07:16] <gyaresu> splintax, gotta edit menu.lst to make them permanent.
[07:16] <splintax> gyaresu: where can i find menu.lst? and is there another way to edit grub permanently? because when i reboot, it goes back to hd1 where it should be hd0
[07:16] <shrndegruv> quick poll, yes or no to boot partition
[07:16] <shrndegruv> ?
[07:16] <splintax> gyaresu: ok, so where can i find it?
[07:16] <charle97> splintax, /boot/grub/menu.lst
[07:16] <ptaylor> shrndegruv: yes!
[07:16] <splintax> charle97: thanks
[07:16] <gyaresu> splintax, 'locate -i menu.lst'  (/boot/grub/menu.lst)
[07:16] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, I'm bah'ing the idea
[07:17] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, It's where the images live.
[07:17] <splintax> charle97, gyaresu: how does grub know where to find menu.lst? what if i were to rearrange my partitions, say put linux on the sda0 instead of sda1, then would grub still work?
[07:17] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, about 50MB unless you want more than 3 or 4 different kernels.
[07:17] <BHSPitLappy> he's only using one distro
[07:17] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: ;P you might get another bah ready, i have used machines with a single / and swap before, just because i got tired of having free space where i didn't need them
[07:18] <shrndegruv> i tend to have one safe, one current, and one in experimental
[07:18] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, that's how my laptop is right now.
[07:18] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, for that reason, too.  My desktop has a /home, a /, a different / (for another distro), and a swap
[07:18] <shrndegruv> hmm
[07:18] <BHSPitLappy> I used to keep a /boot partition on my desktop
[07:19] <gyaresu> splintax, good question. I always 'grub-install' but someone was saying that you don't need to anymore.
[07:19] <BHSPitLappy> ubuntu wouldn't allow it.
[07:19] <shrndegruv> cant decide whether to go without separate home partition...
[07:19] <BHSPitLappy> so, it's not used anymore.
[07:19] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: having one home for 2 distros is where i would say having a /home makes sense
[07:19] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, exactly, that's the role it played on the desktop. although, that's not the only place it makes sense.
[07:19] <gyaresu> splintax, So you could just rewrite it then 'grub-install /dev/blah'
[07:19] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, it's nice having disposable OS partitions
[07:19] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: serious? kubuntu had no issues with my /boot, just ignored the grub.conf and made a new menu.lst
[07:20] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, makes reistalling to ANY linux that much easier...
[07:20] <shrndegruv> you mean having it gyaresu?
[07:20] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, when I installed edgy, it demanded that any assigned /boot partition must be formatted.  So, what the heck good does that do, if I want to use multiple OS's with it?
[07:20] <BHSPitLappy> so I just used the / for /boot
[07:20] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, yes.
[07:20] <BHSPitLappy> no OS I've ever used made that demand before
[07:20] <shrndegruv> so if i have 20.21 gb of free space after boot and swap
[07:21] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: It is actually kind of fun trying to work blind, I learned a few tricks like if you pipe commands through grep looking for error for instance, then send that to /dev/dsp , you will only hear a noise if grep outputs somethign, so if you here a noise, ther was an error :)
[07:21] <shrndegruv> how should i divie it up?
[07:21] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, think ubuntu 7.0: Nuke everything  except home partion >> reinstall
[07:21] <crsd> I've installed nvidia-glx along with linux-restricted-modules, still I have: $ sudo nvidia-glx-config enable   Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver!   What am I missing here?
[07:21] <shrndegruv> yeah thats what i was thinking gyaresu
[07:21] <splintax> gyaresu: Not sure I understand. If I was to move all the partitions, wouldn't I have to boot into some mini-OS to do so (since the currently-running OS is being moved)? ah but grub would still be on the MBR so i could get into that, then manually edit it to boot into something, then edit menu.lst, correct?
[07:21] <nailbiter> What's the next unstable branch after Edgy called?
[07:21] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, it makes it much easier to wipe out, reinstall etc your OS, BUT you have such little space, that I recommend sharing that 20gigs.
=== ctd_ is now known as ctd
[07:21] <gyaresu> splintax, Shazam!
[07:22] <gyaresu> splintax, (grub is like a little OS)
[07:22] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, 20gigs is what I have for linux on this laptop, and that's how I have it.   If I separated them, I risk running out of one or the other's space
[07:22] <syock> hoyo I installed a Swallow meta applet which i told to swallow gnome calculator, now GNOME panel is unusable
[07:22] <shrndegruv> yeah its  a tradeoff
[07:22] <mia> this fuse method isnt working for me
[07:22] <BHSPitLappy> syock, that sounds horrible
[07:22] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: the gui didnt work for me since / is hda7 (did some trickery with primary partitions to keep XP happy), the alternate cd installer took /boot just fine
[07:22] <mia> i think i want to build ntfs write support into my kernel
[07:22] <syock> where`s the configuration file for applications startup?
[07:22] <splintax> gyaresu: okay then. I still have a problem. I think I've edited menu.lst the way I want it. However I still can't boot into windows
[07:23] <gyaresu> mia, ntfs-3g is the way to go.
[07:23] <splintax> gyaresu: i've spoken to windows people about the problem
[07:23] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, did it demand the /boot partition be formatted? The GUI installer stated it like a rule.
[07:23] <splintax> gyaresu: do you know the correct GRUB configuration to boot into windows?
[07:23] <mia> gyaresu: is that available for amd64
[07:23] <shrndegruv> do i write the new partition table BEFORE naming the partitions?
[07:23] <splintax> gyaresu: #windows people say that my problem is likely caused by incorrect bootloader configuration
[07:23] <gyaresu> splintax,  "i've spoken to windows people about the problem" Oh dear god.
[07:23] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, "naming them"?
[07:23] <Jordan_U> shrndegruv: Yes.
[07:23] <BHSPitLappy> oh
[07:23] <BHSPitLappy> mount points
[07:23] <BHSPitLappy> yes
[07:23] <KakarottoCL> Jordan_U: do you have msn messenger?
[07:23] <dacableguy> nailbiter - Feisty Fawn
[07:23] <sethk> splintax, I do, yes.  can you put your menu.lst on the paste web site?
[07:24] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: the gui states it like a rule, the alternate did what i told it to do and left it alone.
[07:24] <shrndegruv> i need to tell which is /boot /home and / right?
[07:24] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: No, I am trying to pm you but it isn't working.
[07:24] <syock> What is the config file for GNOME(panel) apps startup?
[07:24] <nailbiter> dacableguy: ...
[07:24] <spiderworm> my ubuntu box seemingly randomly changed the system date and time, its of course incorrect, anyone know how to set it correct from the command line?
[07:24] <mia> gyaresu: i dont have that in my repo, i dont think its available for amd64
[07:24] <gyaresu> splintax, sethk yeah. what he said :)
[07:24] <dusk> what is a good audiophile audio player, ala foobar2k for windows
[07:24] <dacableguy> yes nailbiter?
[07:24] <KakarottoCL> Jordan_U: it won't, you need to register in order to pm..
[07:24] <morphish> BHSPitLappy: the funniest part on when people figure out how to partition a drive is: They spend more time thinking about it than it would take to install the OS
[07:24] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, well, my position is unchanged, as I already hated the GUI installer before. I just come to expect this from it.
[07:25] <mia> why cant i make a new kernel?
[07:25] <mia> CHK     include/linux/version.h
[07:25] <mia> make[1] : *** No rule to make target `init/main.o',
[07:25] <nailbiter> dacableguy: I was just surprised at the choice of name. :)
[07:25] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: That's the strange part, I am registered.
[07:25] <KakarottoCL> Jordan_U: don't you have any instant messenger?
[07:25] <BHSPitLappy> morphish, oh, I've spent lots of time planning and strategizing partitions.
[07:25] <gyaresu> mia no. it's technically beta. but works really really well.
[07:25] <dacableguy> nailbiter - gotcha
[07:25] <Jordan_U> KakarottoCL: Google talk
[07:25] <gyaresu> !ntfs-3g
[07:25] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but is still BETA software, so use it with caution. Dapper installation instructions http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710
[07:26] <splintax> sethk, gyaresu: http://pastebin.ca/243231 is the relevant part of menu.lst. i know i need to change root to (hd0,0) but i'm not sure about the other options - are the map and makeactive parts something to do with the fact that windows doesn't support multi-booting properly?
[07:26] <Thanos> i have no internet on my ubuntu machine
[07:26] <shrndegruv> guys i dont understand this -- do i need to tell which is /boot and which is /?
[07:26] <shrndegruv> gparted doesnt seem to let me specify
[07:26] <mia> gyaresu: problem is that im using edgy not dapper and amd64 not x86
[07:26] <splintax> gyaresu: yes well the windows people warned me that you guys would be yelling at me for various reasons so it seems there's some animosity between the two camps :P
[07:26] <zOrK> hi, I want to install other linux distro but I cant make another distro through gparted
[07:26] <charle97> shrndegruv, you really want a /boot?
[07:27] <zOrK> another ext3
[07:27] <zOrK> hi, I want to install other linux distro but I cant make another ext3 partition through gparted
[07:27] <shrndegruv> yes
[07:27] <zOrK> nor partition magic
[07:27] <shrndegruv> way ive always done it charle
[07:27] <sethk> splintax, I'm getting one from a machine that has dual boot working.  hold on while I log in there.  (unless gyaresu knows the answer already)
[07:27] <gyaresu> splintax, nope. I fix windows for a living for money. I help here for love. You figure it out...
[07:27] <shrndegruv> stubborn ;)
[07:27] <mia> what do i have to do to an out of the box ubuntu install for it to allow me to build my own kernel
[07:27] <sethk> splintax, don't believe everything you hear in #windows  :)
[07:27] <charle97> shrndegruv, yes you need to tell ubuntu which partittion is the /boot and /?
[07:27] <sethk> splintax, I have nothing against people in #windows, as long as they don't insist that I run windows.  :)
[07:27] <gyaresu> mia, build-essential and kernel-headers (kernel-source)
[07:28] <shrndegruv> yeah how charle97?
[07:28] <charle97> shrndegruv, disregarde the '?'
[07:28] <morphish> splintax: true must linux geeks are windows haters
[07:28] <gyaresu> sethk, that's what vmware is for ;)
[07:28] <syock> Hi, there is this panel applet which renders my panel unusable, and it startsup with the panel. Do anyone know how to fix that?
[07:28] <charle97> shrndegruv, highlight mount point
[07:28] <mia> zOrK: you can only have 3 prmary partitions
[07:28] <shrndegruv> what i really want to know is is that next after writing the partition?
[07:28] <tritium> !kernel | mia
[07:28] <ubotu> mia: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[07:28] <gyaresu> morphish, only because it's rubbish :)
[07:28] <sethk> splintax, my section (from a working file) that boots windows is only three lines, including the title.
[07:28] <sethk> splintax, your title line is fine
[07:28] <Shadowpillar> how come interfaces keep coming up?
[07:28] <shrndegruv> fstab specifies that no?
[07:28] <sethk> splintax, ah, I see what you are doing
[07:29] <zOrK> mia, ok, so I can't install other Linux distro?!
[07:29] <splintax> sethk: well yeah, i assumed so, but i'm changing it to WinXP or something shorter
[07:29] <charle97> shrndegruv, after wrirting the partition you're ready to install
[07:29] <shrndegruv> right
[07:29] <Shadowpillar> I turn off certain interfaces and they turn back on after so many minutes and they wreck my connection
[07:29] <teenprogrammer> hwo do I copy a whole directory from one location to another O.O
[07:29] <iceman> guys,is there a way of re-installing ubuntu without over writing the home folder?
[07:29] <shrndegruv> but how does it know where the / partition is
[07:29] <sethk> splintax, the feature where you exchange the drives that way, is known to have problems with certain BIOS types and versions.
[07:29] <shrndegruv> if i havent specified it
[07:29] <gyaresu> Shadowpillar, Because of the "auto" line in /etc/networking/interfaces
[07:29] <mia> zOrK: u can, but you need to start making extended partitions
[07:29] <splintax> sethk: i think i need to take out both map commands, correct? because i'm now booting from hd0 (that's what grub's installed on)
[07:29] <charle97> shrndevgruv, use your arrows and highlight 'mount point'
[07:29] <zOrK> mia, ok thanks
[07:29] <gyaresu> iceman, yes.
[07:29] <sethk> splintax, is it really necessary?  linux will run perfectly happy from hd1.  can't you just make the windows box hd0 permanently?
[07:29] <sethk> splintax, oh, ok, good
[07:29] <charle97> shrndevgruv, and choose
[07:30] <sethk> splintax, then all you need are two lines:
[07:30] <shrndegruv> i dont see a mountpoint option
[07:30] <mia> tritium: im convinced i need a new kernel for ntfs write support on edgy-amd64
[07:30] <sethk> splintax,           rootnoverify (hd0,0)
[07:30] <splintax> sethk: no room on hd1 and hd2 is fucked so i'm stuck with partitioning hd0 for both windows and linux
[07:30] <iceman> gyaresu: how
[07:30] <sethk> splintax,                             chainloader +1
[07:30] <sethk> splintax, linux doesn't care
[07:30] <Shadowpillar> gyaresu: ath0 isnt auto
[07:30] <mia> tritium: ntfs-3g is only for dapper and fuse isnt working
[07:30] <Shadowpillar> that's the odd bit
[07:30] <sethk> splintax, it will run perfectly happily from hd1
[07:30] <syock> ^betul^: biar betul
[07:30] <shrndegruv> will it automatically handle dual boot?
[07:30] <shrndegruv> if not i have to abort
[07:30] <sethk> splintax, only windows cares.  so leave windows as hd0, and everybody is happy
[07:31] <charle97> shrndegruv, ubuntu wil handle the dual boot
[07:31] <zOrK> mia, I've to delete a partition , but I can't do that ( important info there ) , what should I do?
[07:31] <gyaresu> iceman, chose to install home to the home partition and don't format it (if you have desktop ubuntu disk)
[07:31] <sethk> shrndegruv, if you have windows installed, the isntalled will put windows onto the boot menu
=== bobbie4 is now known as bobbie__4
[07:31] <gyaresu> Shadowpillar, That is interesting.
[07:31] <shrndegruv> now morphish can i have more than one primary partition?
[07:31] <sethk> splintax, those two linesa are all you need
[07:31] <splintax> sethk: i think i've got it set up correctly now, but do you have a link to a good FAQ on menu.lst syntax? i want to learn what all the commands do so i have a better grasp on what the hell's going on. that way if i kill it again i can fix it without you guys
[07:32] <iceman> thanx,let me try
[07:32] <sethk> splintax, I can point you at a doc file, if you have linux installed already.
[07:32] <Shadowpillar> gyaresu: and how come my onboard card is eth1 instead of eth0
[07:32] <splintax> sethk: speaking to you from ubuntu - working fine from hd0/1 infact
[07:32] <sethk> splintax, otherwise get it from the grub distribution tarball.
[07:33] <gyaresu> Shadowpillar, dmesg |grep eth
[07:33] <mia> zOrK: i dont know what you mean
[07:33] <mia> delete one OS and reinstall it in an extended partition
[07:34] <sethk> splintax, the file you want is grub.texi.  It's in a mark up languages.  You an run a program to get a doc out of it, but you can read the markup lnaguge in the marked up file.
[07:34] <nrdb> I would like to program the Atmell 89c2051 is this possible with Linux?
[07:34] <therapy> does anyone know how to make the volume buttons on my laptop work with xubuntu?
[07:34] <zOrK> mia, how do I make a extended partition?
[07:34] <splintax> sethk: i know TeX
[07:34] <kuzmaster> hey all
[07:34] <charle97> shrndegruv, you still here?
[07:34] <syock> Hi, there is this panel applet which renders my panel unusable, and it startsup with the panel. Do anyone know how to fix that?
[07:34] <kuzmaster> ive herd various things but.....
[07:34] <kuzmaster> how stable it ubuntu 6.10
[07:35] <sethk> splintax, good.  YOu entered from #windows, so I didn't know how much you know.
[07:35] <charle97> kuzmaster, very stable for me .... i clean installed it
[07:35] <kuzmaster> same....but
[07:35] <splintax> sethk: ;-)
[07:35] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, Well worth using.
[07:35] <kuzmaster> the LAN like just died
[07:35] <mia> zOrK: i use fdisk
[07:35] <kuzmaster> then after 3 restarts, it was fine
[07:35] <kuzmaster> :-/
[07:35] <spiderworm> my ubuntu box seemingly randomly changed the system date and time, its of course incorrect, anyone know how to set it correct from the command line?
[07:35] <zOrK> Command (m for help): n
[07:35] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, cables? wireless?
[07:35] <zOrK> You must delete some partition and add an extended partition first
[07:35] <Healot> dang, emoticons
[07:35] <gyaresu> spiderworm, 'date'
[07:35] <shrndegruv> sugar
[07:36] <Thanos> my lan is unstable as well
[07:36] <shrndegruv> morph i think you were right
[07:36] <Thanos> fresh install
[07:36] <kuzmaster> hmmmmmmm.......
[07:36] <kuzmaster> how about wifi
[07:36] <shrndegruv> wont let me put / on a logical drive
[07:36] <shrndegruv> says no root filesystem
[07:36] <kuzmaster> anyone having problems with wifi?
[07:36] <Thanos> i am cables
[07:36] <sethk> spiderworm, the date command has a set mode.
[07:36] <Luke> how do you find the current X display?
[07:36] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, which chip. please be specific.
[07:36] <Jbirk> I went to a job interview today
[07:36] <syock> I wish i could start another terminal to work on my pc...
[07:36] <kuzmaster> ummmm... i think its a ralink
[07:36] <kuzmaster> its a dlink
[07:36] <gyaresu> !offtopic > Jbirk
[07:37] <mia> ok turns out compiling the kernel is nothing like in gentoo.  is there an ntfs-3g for edgy amd64?
[07:37] <spiderworm> im confused how the date was changed on my system
[07:37] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, rt2500?
[07:37] <mia> !offtopic > mia
[07:37] <Thanos> i give up
[07:37] <syock> na, dareka onegai
[07:37] <spiderworm> it suddenly happened, i did nothing, and could find nothing in cron
[07:37] <kuzmaster> dont think so
[07:37] <kuzmaster> i forget what model it is
[07:37] <tritium> mia: you can compile it in much the same way as in gentoo, but the preferred method is to use make-kpkg to build a .deb package
[07:37] <mia> CHK     include/linux/version.h
[07:37] <mia> make[1] : *** No rule to make target `init/main.o', needed by `init/built-in.o'.
[07:38] <gyaresu> mia, grab the source (top google link i think) after installing 'fuse'
[07:38] <shrndegruv> can anyone advise on how to get this heap to put / on a logical partition
[07:38] <charle97> shrndegruv, did you set / on a partition?
[07:38] <mia> gyaresu: what source?
[07:38] <kuzmaster> would there be any problems using the kde wifi manager on gnome?
[07:38] <mia> gyaresu: ntfs-3g?
[07:38] <gyaresu> mia, ntfs-3g sourde
[07:38] <gyaresu> mia, yep.
[07:38] <shrndegruv> yes charle
[07:39] <gyaresu> mia, ooh. they have a website now... http://www.ntfs-3g.org/
[07:40] <Healot> 3G :)
[07:40] <BHSPitLappy> I just installed ntfs-3g in synaptics
[07:40] <BHSPitLappy> from the badgerports repo
[07:40] <tarelerulz> ntfs-3g works great
[07:40] <tarelerulz> I use it all the time
[07:40] <BHSPitLappy> I don't know how to set it up
[07:40] <BHSPitLappy> but I installed it! :D
[07:40] <tarelerulz> all you have to do
[07:40] <tarelerulz> what I did was
[07:40] <Luke> how do you find the current X display?
[07:40] <kuzmaster> how do you start network-manager-gnome?
[07:40] <gyaresu> mia, it's in the repos. (thanks BHSPitLappy )

[07:41] <charle97> luke, the x version?
[07:41] <gyaresu> mia, (sorry)
[07:41] <BHSPitLappy> tarelerulz, yeah, just saw.
[07:41] <tarelerulz> Well, it is great
[07:41] <tarelerulz> read /write
[07:41] <mia> gyaresu: i have fuse modprobed and whein i try to configure ntfs-3g:  checking for fuse >= 2.5.0... configure: error: ntfs-3g requires FUSE >= 2.5.0.
[07:42] <gyaresu> mia, urgh.
[07:42] <mia> so i guess im back to trying to compile a kernel
[07:42] <tarelerulz> I use it for my 300 gb drive fat32 and my 160 gb ntfs
[07:42] <BHSPitLappy> :D
[07:42] <BHSPitLappy> I can finally start fixing tags on my ntfs collection
[07:42] <BHSPitLappy> mia, how did you install it
[07:42] <Luke> charle97: 7.1.1
[07:42] <tarelerulz> I wish I could get gyach enhanded working
[07:43] <shrndegruv> holy sugar
[07:43] <shrndegruv> its connecting to my wireless network
[07:43] <theDtTvB> Hello, how can I disable the desktop manager Nautilus?
[07:43] <mia> tritium: you said i could compile my kernel ala gentoo, but how come i cant make after setting it up how i want it
[07:43] <shrndegruv> how is that possible havent told it the password
[07:43] <mia> BHSPitLappy: install what?
[07:43] <gyaresu> BHSPitLappy, man you've gotta start reading the posts... He hasn't.
[07:43] <mia> BHSPitLappy: fuse?
[07:43] <BHSPitLappy> shrndegruv, see if it succeeds
[07:43] <BHSPitLappy> mia, ntfs-3g
[07:43] <sethk> BBl
[07:44] <gyaresu> shrndegruv, it will but you won't get dhcp methinks
[07:44] <mia> BHSPitLappy: i didnt, the channel bot linked me to the docs which indicated teh package was only for dapper x86.  im edge amd64
[07:44] <charle97> luke, are you referring to xdm?
[07:44] <shrndegruv> must be connected to another wireless
[07:44] <Luke> charle97: no... the current X display
[07:44] <shrndegruv> anyway
[07:44] <shrndegruv> still cant get it to see root filesystem
[07:45] <gyaresu> BHSPitLappy, START READING THE POSTS PLEASE.
[07:45] <tarelerulz> do any you know anything about gyach-enhanced_pyvoice-
[07:45] <BHSPitLappy> !caps
[07:45] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[07:45] <gyaresu> BHSPitLappy, Look muppet. I WAS SHOUTING AT YOU.
[07:46] <shrndegruv> forums seem to have a solution
[07:46] <BHSPitLappy> oh, that changes the intent of !caps
[07:46] <syock> i give up, i just dunno the solution
[07:46] <kuzmaster> how would i start kwifi manager?
[07:46] <mia> BHSPitLappy: its compiled now, i needed fuse0dev
[07:46] <kuzmaster> in gnome?
[07:47] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, is it installed? If so then from the command line.
[07:47] <BHSPitLappy> mia, sorry, I'm just getting a hard time for even bothering to try. This is why I dislike this channel; I'm out
[07:47] <kuzmaster> what do i write?
[07:47] <kuzmaster> put it?
[07:48] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, First you need to know the command. I imagine it will be kwifimanager but you can type 'apropos kwifi' and that should return the progs name.
[07:48] <kuzmaster> thanx
[07:48] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, From a terminal yes?
[07:48] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, no probs.
[07:49] <kuzmaster> ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!
[07:49] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, hmmm?
[07:49] <kuzmaster> should i be having any problems use kwifi manager with ubuntu 6.10
[07:50] <kuzmaster> ?
[07:50] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, If you are having problems... then, yes.
[07:50] <kuzmaster> lol
[07:50] <kuzmaster> its like broke i think
[07:51] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, I can tell you how to do things with command line. I don't use kwifi so maybe someone else can help there.
[07:51] <mia> cool that worked.  now whats the "ubuntu way" of taking other mount option out of fstab and automating it usng ntfs-3g
[07:51] <kuzmaster> could you do that maybe please?
[07:51] <gyaresu> mia, had a look at fstab?
[07:51] <gyaresu> mia, noticed the UUID's
[07:51] <mia> gyaresu: yeah, a little different than im used to
[07:51] <mia> gyaresu: yeah i noticed
[07:51] <tarelerulz> libltdl.so.3 I don't seem to have that file  and I can
[07:51] <tarelerulz> t find it with synaptic
[07:51] <gyaresu> mia, 'ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/'
[07:52] <gyaresu> kuzmaster, there you shall find them.

[08:16] <sethfelder> ill try installing kde for ubuntu 6.10
[08:16] <sethfelder> that might help.........
[08:16] <fd0man> I'm not sure why that would, but if it works
[08:16] <Commander-Crowe> I download a theme from xfce-look.com(?) and I extracted the tar but what do I do wit the files it gives me?
[08:16] <fd0man> Then go for it, I guess.
[08:16] <Commander-Crowe> I'm in Xfce
[08:17] <Commander-Crowe> hello?
[08:17] <nrdb> Flannel: opps ... I was looking at the sdcc webpage.  thanks I will install it and see how it goes.
[08:18] <Flannel> Commander-Crowe: try asking in #xubuntu
[08:18] <Commander-Crowe> I did
[08:18] <Commander-Crowe> n one seem to be there
[08:18] <fd0man> Has anyone had any success with running glxgears (or, for that matter, OpenOffice.org) in a dual-headed configuration under Edgy?
[08:19] <sethfelder> how can i installed kde ontop of gnome, but still keep gnome?
[08:19] <sethfelder> is it possible

[08:20] <smoenux> lol... flannel, you are always here :P
[08:20] <fd0man> sethfelder, sureapt-get install kubuntu-desktop kde
[08:20] <tich_> sethfelder, in my experience it can get a little glitchy
[08:21] <sethfelder> then i wont....
[08:21] <Flannel> fd0man, sethfelder, you don't need to install kde, juts kubuntu desktop
[08:21] <sethfelder> yeah yeah yeah
[08:21] <sethfelder> umm.......
[08:21] <fd0man> Flannel, true; though Kubuntu-desktop leaves out many things from KDE, so I add the KDE package, too, which pulls a ton of stuff for KDE.
[08:22] <ruzugetht> Hi all, have a dual boot system and need rw access to the NTFS part, is there a util for this?
[08:22] <Flannel> fd0man: correct, but do you want kubuntu? or kde?
[08:22] <Flannel> !fuse | ruzugetht
[08:22] <ubotu> ruzugetht: Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
[08:22] <ruzugetht> thanks
[08:22] <fd0man> Flannel, I generally like to have the entire desktop that I am using.  I usually use Ubuntu, so after installing I also apt-get the GNOME metapackage.
[08:22] <shrndegruv> sweet im all installed
[08:23] <shrndegruv> lets see if ubuntu starts
[08:23] <Flannel> fd0man: alright, then you might only want to install kde, and not kubuntu.  If you install both, you're likely to end up with duplicate things (two offices, or whatnot)
[08:23] <tich_> does anyone know how to make the graying of the screen (when passwords are entered) stop?
[08:23] <shrndegruv> ha
[08:23] <shrndegruv> sweeet
[08:24] <shrndegruv> can people help me with wireless
[08:24] <fd0man> Flannel, Oh, interesting.  Didn't realize you couldn't easily have multiple desktops installed.
[08:24] <shrndegruv> for instance
[08:24] <shrndegruv> how do i tell which wireless profile its using?
[08:25] <Flannel> fd0man: you can, ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop, etc.  but, if you have kubuntu- and kde, then whatever the Kubuntu people swapped out of KDE for the kubuntu stuff, you'll have both, etc.
[08:25] <grant> hey guys, quick question about xmms, how do you recieve shoutcast tv streams?

[08:25] <reorourke> I bought a new hard drive tonight and would like to install it as the primary HD for my PC, to run XP.  My current HD is running Ubuntu - it does have GRuB installed but how can I ensure that once I install the new HD that I'll still be able to access my Linux drive?  Anything written online about this?

[08:26] <stylus> what command can i use to search for directories?
[08:26] <fd0man> stylus, What are you searching for?  Just a list of directories on your system?
[08:27] <fd0man> stylus, Try this:  "tree -d"but note that it requires that you install the "tree" package.
[08:28] <stylus> fd0man: i'm just searching for a specific dir
[08:28] <stylus> i'll give that a shot, thanks
[08:28] <fd0man> stylus, Okay, then try this: find -type d 'directorypattern'
[08:28] <grant> stylus, or you could try disk usage manager
[08:29] <grant> if you want a gui
[08:29] <stylus> Ok, but fd0man - where can I find that "tree" package? apt-get isn't bringing anything up.
[08:29] <grant> hey guys, quick question about xmms, how do you recieve shoutcast tv streams?

[08:33] <fd0man> reorourke, You will need to install your new HD, install your Microsoft operating system, and then afterwards, boot into a rescue CD to update the configuration so that your system can boot.  I can't find anything online that outlines it concisely for your situation, though.

[08:36] <Commander-Crowe> anyone?
[08:36] <MrKeuner> hi, why isn't there as much updates for edgy as ubuntu-1?
[08:36] <dooglus> Commander-Crowe: XFCE isn't a GNOME theme, it's its own desktop environment
[08:36] <fd0man> Tomcat_, The only part it doesn't cover is updating /etc/fstab.  Unfortuantely, the person left already
[08:37] <dooglus> MrKeuner: what's ubuntu-1?
[08:37] <Healot> i think he meant 6.06
[08:37] <MrKeuner> dooglus: 6.06
[08:37] <sagar_> whenever i click a ".desktop" file, ubuntu gives me errors and says it cant open it..the same goes for image files, even after i add a file type association...is this a gnome-vfs problem ors omething??
[08:38] <dooglus> MrKeuner: ubuntu isn't fashionable any more.  when 6.06 was out lots of people liked ubuntu, but now it's kind of jumped the shark
[08:38] <MrKeuner> isn't it because 6.06 is more stable than 6.10?
[08:38] <MrKeuner> I mean 6.06 has to be more stable
[08:38] <syock> Yeaaa I`m freeeee!
[08:39] <dooglus> MrKeuner: both 6.06 and 6.10 are supported at the moment, so they should both be getting updates

[08:42] <Tomcat_> grant: Try "host somedomain.com" and see if the lag is happening there.
[08:43] <Tomcat_> grant: Use some domain that you haven't visited today.
[08:43] <Tomcat_> grant: Then try "telnet <ip> 80" using the ip you got from "host"... and see if the lag is there.

[08:45] <grant> tomcat, i've got dual boot setup with xp, don't get the lag in xp so its not a connection issue

[08:45] <grant> stylus, any luck solving it?
[08:46] <stylus> same thing happens while i'm browsing web pages.
[08:46] <Tomcat_> grant: You can try putting "blacklist ipv6" in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, then reboot... that might be a problem.
[08:46] <stylus> nah, can't get it to speed up. it's something to do with the looking up

[08:57] <snowshoefox> I'd like to remove the "Loading Linux Kerenl..." xerox window style to something cooler
[08:57] <firstknight> reorourke, yes
[08:58] <totall_6_7> firstknight: i believe you can change session to one that will just give you a command prompt
[08:58] <splintax> reorourke: not by default, but i think there is software you can install to read ext3 partitions
[08:58] <splintax> reorourke: did you format your linux partition as ext3?
[08:58] <tich_> snowshoefox, the only thing i have ever heard about boot up proceedure is with a distro called gnewsense which is based on ubuntu

[09:00] <reorourke> splintax I'm adding a new hard drive to my system so I can run XP on it, so I have to make it the primary hard drive right?  any way that you know of that I can ensure access to dual-boot, so I can choose to boot into my current linux system?
[09:00] <splintax> reorourke: i'm probably not the best person to ask about these things since i'm currently trying to fix my dual-boot setup
[09:01] <splintax> reorourke: but my guess would be, yes. you have to install GRUB and windows on the same disk
[09:01] <reorourke> ah lol ok - trying to make sure I don't screw mine up
[09:01] <splintax> reorourke: and you have to set that disk to be the first boot option in BIOS. at least that's my understanding of it.
[09:01] <astro> mzli, i dont know what to do :(
[09:01] <grant> hey guys i'm back
[09:02] <reorourke> hmm so if I go ahead with the install of the new primary hard drive and install grub along with my windows install, then I should be able to access either system/hard drive upon boot
[09:02] <grant> tomcat, don't know why but that seems to be much faster now, em, could you explain why please?
[09:02] <reorourke> at least theoretically? lol
[09:02] <dope> none of my wmv files play in firefox
[09:02] <splintax> reorourke: grub has an option to specify the command to load an OS manually at boot.
[09:02] <splintax> reorourke: the syntax is fairly simple. do you have another computer to get onto IRC with incase things go wrong?
[09:02] <reorourke> hmm no not really
[09:03] <dope> none of my wmv files play in firefox
[09:03] <Tomcat_> grant: Some network configurations have problems with ipv6, which is a new Internet protocol... at the moment you probably don't need it, so it doesn't matter if we disable it. But in a couple of years you might need to ask some network expert to fix that.
[09:03] <splintax> are you currently single-booting?
[09:03] <reorourke> currently single booting I suppose - grub still runs on boot but right now linux is the only OS I have installed
[09:03] <stylus> how can i bring up my gateway ip with the router, so that I know where to forward the ports? is it ifconfig?
[09:03] <reorourke> but I'm wanting to keep what I have on my linux hard drive and add another hard drive for windows
[09:04] <grant> tomcat, if anything its probably my isp then, i'm in the middle east and they are restrictive as hell
[09:04] <dope> none of my wmv files play in firefox
[09:04] <splintax> reorourke: my recommendation would be to take out your linux HDD, and set up windows as the only OS on the computer
[09:04] <splintax> make sure that your linux can't be affected
[09:04] <Tomcat_> grant: Usually it's bad configuration or bad software on the other side, yes. ;)
[09:04] <ds> anyone know why debian/ubuntu have an ancient version of bittorrent?
[09:04] <splintax> reorourke: then after that, set it to boot from linux
[09:04] <Tomcat_> grant: And since most people use Windows and Windows doesn't have ipv6 enabled by default, it doesn't matter for most people.
[09:04] <splintax> boot from the linux HDD
[09:04] <dope> none of my wmv files play in firefox
[09:04] <grant> i better not say to much about Etisalat...they might be listening...
[09:05] <splintax> then edit the grub configuration from linux. you can set it up to 'trick' windows into thinking it's running off the main HDD or somethign.

[09:09] <KenSentMe> I have two soundcards in my system. How can i make sure that in default ubuntu always uses one, except when i choose a program to use the other soundcard. Where do i do these things?
[09:10] <splintax> reorourke: you should be editing the grub configuration while running linux. that's the only way that you can get the grub configuration to be permanent.
[09:10] <dope> i tried the w32codecs and the mozilla-mplayer
[09:10] <dope> but the embeded wmv files don't play
[09:10] <splintax> reorourke: when editing grub from grub, the changes are only temporary, and will go back to what they were before next time you reboot.
[09:10] <splintax> reorourke: but as i say, i learnt this today while trying to set up my machine to dual-boot
[09:11] <splintax> reorourke: only i'm going from windows only to win+lin, opposite to you.
[09:11] <splintax> reorourke: so you should probably get separate confirmation that what i'm saying is all correct.
[09:11] <reorourke> splintax: thanks
[09:11] <reorourke> anyone else able to confirm?
[09:12] <astro> so is anyone avaliable to help me out in getting my wireless to connect to the router
[09:13] <brutopia> astro: what kind of wireless interface you have
[09:13] <gabrielg> morning
[09:13] <astro> internal on my HP notebook zd8000
[09:13] <astro> connecting to a Belkin router
[09:13] <brutopia> intel centrino?
[09:13] <gabrielg> quick question: what's the uid and gid of the 'ubuntu' user on the Edgy Live CD?
[09:13] <ruxpin> gabrielg: getent passwd | grep ubuntu
[09:13] <gabrielg> i don't have any possibility to test atm, but need to write instructions
[09:13] <lazzareth> gabrielg, Wouldnt it be 1000 ?
[09:14] <ruxpin> gabrielg: id backuppc
[09:14] <ruxpin> gabrielg: id ubuntu, I mean :)
[09:14] <astro> brutopia, im unsure, its a P4 is all I know
[09:14] <gabrielg> lazzareth: it sounds reasonable, yes. it's the common one isn't it
=== Sby_Fitnes_Diran is now known as cowox^sby
[09:14] <gabrielg> ruxpin: but i'm not running the live cd right now, unfortunately, or i wouldn't be asking ;)
[09:14] <astro> i just know its an HP Pavilion zd8000
[09:15] <gabrielg> i just figured that *somebody* in here should be running the cd right now :)
[09:16] <brutopia> astro: write sudo lspci |grep -i broadcom on the shell and paste what it outputs
[09:16] <astro> its really starting to get to me lol
[09:17] <brutopia> is this BCM94306 string there

[09:20] <MikeDK> Hi all
=== dubbedducky is now known as arnducky
[09:23] <Han> hi. I installed server and then xubuntu-desktop metapackage and then removed just the metapackage and now apt-get always suggests to use autoremove to remove all the packages required by the xubuntu-desktop metapackage. How do I make apt-get understand I like those packages (at least most of them)
[09:24] <deep__> Leave the metapackage? :)
[09:24] <Han> well it was suggested to remove the meta-package to be able to remove for instance cups.
[09:26] <HumanPrototype> hi all

[09:45] <shrndegruv> couldnt find xchat
[09:45] <gnomefreak> Mantice: i havent run xgl/compiz in a long time. im more on the lines of beryl. you would really need to ask in #ubuntu-xgl or #xgl or #compiz

[09:46] <e_machinist> In a default Ubuntu install, are the default display drivers the DRI drivers?
[09:47] <gnomefreak> KenSentMe: there is but i dont remember what it is since edgy can by default play more than one sound per card now and dapper had a package to isntall for multi sounds
[09:47] <e_machinist> If it detects an ATI card (or even an NV).
[09:47] <Mantice> gnomefreak, You know how when you open up your console and it says its ready with the  user@computer

[09:50] <mistform> MikeDK, I get errors from everywhere, so I just want to get wine to work
[09:50] <gnomefreak> Mantice: or both
[09:50] <e_machinist> In order to use the Open Source DRI drivers for an ATI card, should the xorg.conf Driver be "ati" or "radeon"? I have seen both used for the DRI drivers.
[09:50] <Mantice> gnomefreak: I was installing beryl but it told me to log out and select XGL session or somthing like that.

[10:26] <loutrine> Is xchat much better then gaim for irc usage? Any features which are worth changing for?
[10:26] <mandelum> I by mistake resized the panel to the max, then it logged out, then when it logged in it logged out agian.... Then when I logged in, I just had time to make the panel smaler, but now, when I restarted a couple of times, the sound loops and everything is quite slow, and I get some warnings about some stuff on the panel
[10:26] <boink> loutrine: depends on what you need to do
[10:26] <boink> xchat is only for irc, gaim is for much more
[10:26] <loutrine> boink: Hmm, good question...
[10:26] <mandelum> How could I reset some stuff?
[10:27] <aldwin> degrysky, is sudo a user name?
[10:27] <boink> I use gaim for MSN stuff, while irssi for irc (like now)
[10:27] <Madpilot> loutrine, XChat's channel list is easier to find, it's got a GUI to read a channel's banlist, and it's generally far more flexible &complete for IRC than gaim
[10:27] <loutrine> boink: Is there any reason you don't use gaim for irc as well?
[10:27] <Mantice> I got beryl to boot but now it just is a white screen every thing is white, Heh
[10:28] <boink> loutrine: I prefer irssi since I prefer to do irc on the cli
[10:28] <boink> nerd thing :)
[10:28] <defrysk> aldwin, username ? where did you get that term from being so new at this ?
[10:28] <loutrine> boink: epenis +1 :P?
[10:28] <boink> yeah, suppose so :)

[10:28] <loutrine> Madpilot: thanks :)
[10:29] <aldwin> sorry
[10:29] <Madpilot> aldwin, easy with the pasting...
[10:29] <aldwin> so sorry...
[10:29] <aldwin> Madpilot, sorry
[10:29] <loutrine> I'll check out xchat and maybe irssi if i'm feeling cool... ;)
[10:29] <Mantice> Madpilot, do you use beryl or know much about it ?
[10:29] <aldwin> (im did try to copy and i wasn't that focus. im so sorry)
[10:29] <Madpilot> Mantice, don't touch it, know zip about it. Sorry!
[10:30] <aldwin> is there a ubuntu pdf???
[10:30] <Mantice> :( Any one know why my beryl boots and then stays on a white screen
[10:30] <aldwin> is there any sort of ubuntu pdf that is with an official release?
[10:30] <loutrine> Mantice: Looked through these http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=beryl+white+screen&btnG=Google+Search&meta= ?
[10:30] <Madpilot> aldwin, of the Desktop Guide, you mean? Yes - check help.ubuntu.com
[10:31] <aldwin> ah, okay.
[10:31] <aldwin> Madpilot, im not using ubuntu right now. cause i really em that lame that i dont know how to use all of it.
[10:31] <aldwin> madpilot, i dont even know how to run the mirc there. im so sorry
[10:32] <Madpilot> aldwin, isn't mirc Windows-only?
[10:32] <boink> well .. where's an op when there's a troll about?
[10:32] <Mantice> I dont know how to update xgl-xserver
[10:32] <loutrine> aldwin: In ubuntu, open a Terminal and type sudo apt-get install xchat. xchat is an irc program similar to mirc which you can use
[10:32] <aldwin> yup i know. but i dont know how to run it
[10:32] <manmadha> Is there any inbuilt software for flash programs...?
[10:32] <BlackBird> I just installed a bunch of new packages with aptitude, and suddenly now I get no graphical login screen. I turn on the computer, load my ubuntu kernel, and it loads into a textual login screen. I have to startx, and then it automatically loads up gnome... however, I want to be able to choose what type of session I log into. If I try to logout, it just brings me back to the non-x console.
[10:32] <Madpilot> boink, which channel is having trouble?
[10:33] <manmadha> like html
[10:33] <aldwin> madpilot, here's how it goes. i tried installing it at my second hard disk and after 2 or three days i manage to make the ubuntu 6.06 run at my computer
[10:33] <loutrine> aldwin: xchat will appear under in Applications -> Internet
[10:33] <aldwin> madpilot, since my computer has this processor of 38. amd2 x2 64 bit. its quite hard to find a running linux at this computer
[10:34] <aldwin> madpilot, so there i was able to install the ubuntu 6.06 like i did said. it was this morning that i had accomplish that.
[10:34] <bimberi> BlackBird: does 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start' from the logged in non-x console work?
[10:34] <Madpilot> aldwin, the 32bit Ubuntu should run fine; there is also an AMD64 Ubuntu
[10:34] <BlackBird> idunno.... havent tried that
[10:34] <aldwin> and now its quite late. its noveber 8, 5pm. i just woke up.
[10:35] <aldwin> madpilot, i did try the those believe me. but only the ubuntu 6.06 did work on my computer.
[10:35] <bimberi> BlackBird: it's supposed to start gdm on boot - hopefully an indicative message will be shown
[10:36] <aldwin> madpilot, 6.06 alternative 64bit. thats the one that did run on my computer.
[10:36] <loutrine> aldwin: So you have Ubuntu installed and running now...?
[10:36] <sn00p> Does anybody have any experience with microsd  storage with ubuntu? I have a AMD 64 bit turion x2 HP note book that i'm trying to get my microsd drive to work with having no luck
[10:36] <Madpilot> aldwin, cool
[10:36] <Za1> hi - how do i get my s-video connection to projector working?  I am running Ubuntu 6.06 on Dell Laptop Inspiron 5100.
[10:36] <BlackBird> bimberi: I'll try that... thanks
[10:37] <aldwin> loutrine, yah i have. but since i dont know how to use much of linux software as well as ubuntu as a distribution. i dont even know how to install a yahoo messenger
[10:37] <Mantice> Could some one help me Im new to this it says re install from http://repos.opensuse.org/X11:/XGL/SUSE_Linux_10.1/ how would I go about this
[10:37] <loutrine> aldwin: gaim is a good all round IM program, give that a try.
[10:38] <defrysk> Mantice, try #ubuntu-xgl
[10:38] <Mantice> I have
[10:38] <Mantice> Every one = zzz
[10:38] <Madpilot> aldwin, gaim can do YM, and the help files are at System menu->Help->System Help->Ubuntu Desktop Guide
[10:38] <defrysk> Mantice, xgl that boring ? ;p
[10:39] <Za1> has anyone able to connect to a projector before?
[10:39] <Mantice> defrysk: My beryl is whiting out and I need to fix it because I just spent an hour trying to get this thing working
[10:39] <loutrine> Mantice: I found a really good, easy to follow guide for setting up xgl+beryl under edgy (gnome) if you're interested...
[10:40] <Mantice> Sure, Ive installed beryl though.
[10:40] <Mantice> It boots it just whites out.
[10:40] <BlackBird> hrm.... didnt work
[10:40] <loutrine> Mantice: http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html
[10:40] <defrysk> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA is the guide I used
[10:41] <defrysk> but beryl is too unstable for usage I think
[10:41] <andry_cute> h
[10:41] <elias_> are the nvidia 9629 dirvers available somewhere already as restricted-modules.deb?
[10:41] <Mantice> I followed that one :( :(
[10:41] <loutrine> defrysk: Mine's running ok :) I had a few problems though... hehe
[10:41] <defrysk> elias_, amaranth's repo has it
[10:42] <Mantice> loutrine: did you get white screen ?
[10:42] <elias_> cool
[10:42] <loutrine> Mantice: I'm typing this to you from it now - works a treat :)
[10:42] <defrysk> elias_, amaranth's is synronized again with the edgy updates
[10:43] <Mantice> loutrine: Was one of the problems you ran into a white screen by any chance, my beryl boots *Finaly* now it just says Beryl and waves around then it whites out.
[10:43] <jaaroo> can I somehow obtain list of packages that are installed which is suitable for "apt-get install". I would like to make copy of my installation.
[10:43] <BlackBird> how would I invoke an icewm or kde session from terminal, or better yet, how would I set up the graphical login screen to autostart after kernel loadup? Right now it just loads into text login, then when I login it automatically starts gnome
[10:44] <loutrine> Mantice: No, sorry. The only problems I experienced were two instances of emerald running & had to fix the annoying shift+backspace feature/bug
[10:44] <elias_> does anybody know if they fixed the turbocache issue which rendered most laptop cards unusable?
=== Cas_ is now known as Cas
[10:44] <Mantice> Does beryl work on the latest kernal loutrine ?
[10:45] <loutrine> Mantice: Running it under Linux edgy 2.6.17-10-generic
[10:46] <Mantice> I got a update saying kernal update on my Dapper
[10:46] <jcrimt> I recently updated my Ubuntu 5.1 which was working perfecty to 6.1. This hangs on the welcome screen by giving a blank cream screen. Even the live CD struggles - it periodically goes blank - cream screen. I used several differnent 6.1 discs with the same result. I have not had to reload 5.1 which works perfectly again. Any ideas?
[10:48] <BlackBird>  how would I invoke an icewm or kde session from terminal, or better yet, how would I set up the graphical login screen to autostart after kernel loadup? Right now it just loads into text login, then when I login it automatically starts gnome
[10:48] <dooglus> jcrimt: first off, you're not supposed to upgrade 5.10 to 6.10 without going to 6.06 in between
[10:48] <opasd> hi,guys
[10:49] <dooglus> jcrimt: (the .10 refers to the month of release - October, and the 5 and 6 are the years)
[10:49] <opasd> i am using router to connect to internet
[10:50] <jcrimt> dooglus - sorry, yes, I was on the most recent release - I updated using the synaptic update - how should I update now ?
[10:50] <loutrine> opasd: Me too :)
[10:50] <dooglus> BlackBird: check which runlevel you are booting into: grep ^id /etc/inittab | cut -d: -f2
[10:51] <opasd> first i unplug the network cable,then i plug it again,how do i connect to internet later?
[10:51] <dooglus> jcrimt: you installed 5.10 and the update-manager offered to upgrade to 'dapper' (6.06)?
[10:51] <opasd> i means by using command
[10:52] <BlackBird> dooglus: it returns "2"
[10:52] <dooglus> opasd: "sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0"
[10:52] <jcrimt> yes, I had actually already upgraded to dapper - it was fine - it was the update to edgy that killed me. I have just reinstalled 5.1 (?hoary)
[10:52] <dooglus> BlackBird: right.  that's the default.  check whether you have links in place to run gdm in runlevel 2:  ls -l /etc/rc2.d/*gdm
[10:52] <opasd> thanks
[10:53] <dooglus> jcrimt: lots of people apparently had trouble upgrading to 6.06.  maybe it's better to stick with 6.06 for now?  I don't know what the official advice is re. upgrading to 6.10 at the moment.
[10:53] <BlackBird> dooglus: lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 13 2006-11-07 18:39 /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm -> ../init.d/gdm
[10:54] <dooglus> BlackBird: the 'S' is for 'start' - ie. it should start gdm (the graphical login thing) automatically when you boot.
[10:54] <jcrimt> Ok thanks - I will have to try and find my  disc. Thans mate
[10:55] <Gavrila> is there any way to make acpi update informations about the current status? I hibernated my laptop while on AC, and resumed it on battery only, but it refuses to detect the battery now.... any hint?
[10:55] <dooglus> BlackBird: what happens if you run "sudo /etc/init.,d/gdm start" after logging in to the console?
[10:55] <dooglus> BlackBird: (without the comma)
[10:56] <BlackBird> dooglus: not sure. lemme check
[10:56] <JohnRobert> where abouts would I put source code for libraries I wanted to compile things against... like instead of downloading a -dev package, where would a normal configure script be looking for source?
[10:56] <defrysk> "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
[10:56] <dooglus> Gavrila: just a guess, but how about "sudo /etc/init.d/acpid restart" ?
[10:56] <rsteele> I'll think about it
[10:56] <opasd> i am using firefox now,if i want to upgrade to firefox 2,what should i do?
[10:57] <defrysk> opasd, I would upgrade to edgy then
[10:57] <Gavrila> dooglus, I've already tried that, but no way
[10:57] <scheuri> defrysk: that is...well...not the recommandation which should be easily taken
[10:58] <dooglus> JohnRobert: build the library then use "sudo checkinstall" to install it as a package.  configure looks in /usr/lib/pkgconfig/ for a corresponding .pc file
[10:58] <dooglus> Gavrila: what happens?  any error message?  anything in the logs?  (/var/log/*)
[10:58] <JohnRobert> thanks dooglus that's some sound advice
[10:59] <dooglus> JohnRobert: you'll need to install "checkinstall" probably.  it's a lazy-man's way of making packages
[10:59] <JohnRobert> I am quite lazy, so that's useful
[10:59] <defrysk> JohnRobert, packages made by checkinstall are for personal usage only
[10:59] <dooglus> JohnRobert: don't run the "make install" step - "sudo checkinstall" is instead of doing that
[11:00] <Gavrila> dooglus when I restart it the script doesn't return any message, and dmesg says that the battery is not present
[11:01] <dooglus> Gavrila: that's the limit of my knowledge in that area I'm afraid.  my battery died years ago, and I never hibernate...
[11:01] <Gavrila> dooglus, hehe ok thanks

[11:04] <BlackBird> dooglus: nothing. It asked for my password, and then just went back to prompt. I had to run startx to get into a graphical interface, and again, it just loaded gnome

[11:05] <djuuss> Hi. My /home is mounted on its own partition, but now it's starting to fill up. How can i mount another partition on a folder inside home? (lets call it /home/djuuss/downloads. /home is on dev/hdd1, the new partition is /dev/hdc2 )
[11:06] <dooglus> BlackBird: was there no output at all from the 'gdm restart' command?
[11:06] <Burnass> does someone now how to fix bad sectors on a USB-stick?
[11:06] <dav1n_> Burnass: tried fsck?
[11:06] <dooglus> djuuss: for a one-off mount, do "sudo mount /dev/hdc2 /home/djuuss/downloads"
[11:06] <BlackBird> dooglus: no. The only indication that anything happened was that it asked for a password.
[11:06] <dooglus> djuuss: if you want it done automatically, edit /etc/fstab - make a copy of the /home line and modify it appropriately
[11:07] <djuuss> did that
[11:07] <dav1n_> dooglus: sudo fsck /dev/whatever
[11:07] <dooglus> BlackBird: see anything written to /var/log/gdm/*?
[11:07] <djuuss> dooglus, added it in both fstab and mtab but it still gives "mount: can't find /home/djuuuss/downloads in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[11:07] <Burnass> dav:1n that checks if there are bad sectors, and i know there are bad ones (log of mkfs.vat)

[11:07] <Shadowpillar> ;)
[11:08] <boni> I am facing a strange problem I changed the mode of my sudoers file from originally 440 to 644 but strangely I dont know nw sudoers is nt visible
[11:08] <Burnass> or can i repaire with fsck
[11:09] <BlackBird> dooglus: just a bunch of warnings then a "cant init" messagej
[11:09] <boni> The freakiest part is tht it says the mode has been changed frm o440 to 0644
[11:09] <dooglus> BlackBird: can you pastebin it?
[11:09] <boni> now how can i revert to the original modes or read write permissions of sudoers
[11:09] <dooglus> djuuss: can you pastebin your /etc/fstab please?
[11:09] <boni> can anyonme help me out??
[11:09] <dav1n_> Burnass: Not sure, try it though.
[11:10] <Burnass> oke i will
[11:10] <djuuss> dooglus: Mistyped djuuss in my sudo mount /home/djuuss/downloads haha, it worked with fstab/mtab entries already
[11:10] <dooglus> boni: sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
[11:10] <dooglus> djuuss: no need to edit /etc/mtab
[11:10] <boni> dooglus: Thats nt happening
[11:10] <boni> the sudo is nt being executed

[11:11] <dooglus> boni: sounds like you've broken sudo then.  if you've set a proper root password then "su" to get a root shell, otherwise you're going to have to boot into recovery mode to fix it
[11:12] <dooglus> djuuss: for future reference, you should use "sudo visudo" to edit the sudoers file, rather than editing it 'manually'
[11:12] <dooglus> djuuss: that way you can't break it so easily...

[11:13] <boni> dooglus: Wat do i have to do to fix this problem from recovery mode???
[11:13] <BlackBird> dooglus: that's it...
[11:13] <Burnass> wel it seems that the bad sectors are repaired strage
[11:13] <boni> dooglus: I think I only have to fix the sudoers file
[11:14] <njan> tx22, think about that question for a second ;)
[11:14] <dooglus> boni: what error are you getting when you try to "sudo" at the moment?
[11:14] <njan> tx22, a "free" SMTP server would allow anyone to send e-mail to anyone through it - it's what's called an "open relay"..
[11:14] <Burnass> tnx
[11:14] <boni> I mean the permissions of this sudoers file??
[11:14] <njan> tx22, which is why virtually every SMTP server only allows mail to be sent from whoever the SMTP server is setup for (ie. an ISP's customers)..
[11:14] <jcrimt> Does anyone know how to configure a Canon 250i usb printer?
[11:14] <dooglus> boni: the permissions should be "440"; so "chmod 440 /etc/sudoers; chown root:root /etc/sudoers"
[11:14] <greenman> anyone get awstats package to work?
[11:14] <tx22> njan; I'm not going to be sending junk email.
[11:14] <djuuss> njan: not true, a large portion SMTP servers are setup 'free', thats where you've been getting all that junk email from
[11:15] <njan> djuuss, let me rephrase.. virtually every *legitimate* SMTP server.. ;)
[11:15] <boni> dooglus: I did sudo chmod 440 /etc/passwd
[11:15] <djuuss> njan, you'd be surprised
[11:15] <dooglus> BlackBird: what's it?
[11:15] <boni> it gives
[11:15] <boni> sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0644, should be 0440
[11:16] <BlackBird> dooglus: I posted that log to a pm... u got pm's blocked or something?
[11:16] <greenman> Anyone get awstats package to work?
[11:16] <dooglus> boni: right.  sudo refuses to run because the permissions are wrong on sudoers.  and to fix them, you need to use sudo...  it's a catch 22 situation.  so boot into recovery mode - then you'll be root, and can 'chmod' the file without using sudo
[11:16] <njan> djuuss, no, I know, it's quite common. But still. It's generally done accidentally or through ignorance rather than because the server's specifically free for open use.
[11:16] <dooglus> BlackBird: freenode doesn't allow pms if you're not registered with nickserv

[11:17] <djuuss> njan i'll give you that :D i think lazyness also plays a very big part here
[11:17] <njan> tx22, you're not, but everyone else using that server probably is, which means it'll probably not stay online long, be slow, and have your mail dropped by spam filters, because the server you send through will be listed on one of the (many) realtime blocklists.

[11:21] <dooglus> khajjak: beep-media-player is a nice simple gui mp3 player

[11:21] <CarinArr> khajjak, once you've got the mp3 codecs installed, amarok is very nice

[11:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about activestate - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:21] <CarinArr> kdevelop is a lot nicer than anjuta
[11:21] <greenman> Can someone PLEASE help me?
[11:21] <CarinArr> but none of them cover that vast a range of languages
[11:21] <defrysk> !ask | greenman
[11:21] <ubotu> greenman: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:22] <CarinArr> he did ask his question
[11:22] <snowshoe1ox> ok, tx
[11:22] <greenman> defrysk: I've asked my question three timeds
[11:22] <CarinArr> he can't get awstats to work
[11:22] <dooglus> greenman: point your web browser at file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/awstats_setup.html
[11:22] <defrysk> greenman, sorry , missed that :s
[11:23] <greenman> dooglus: will that explain how to setup the package?
[11:23] <dooglus> greenman: or file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/index.html for the index of the awstats docs
[11:23] <dooglus> greenman: I don't know, but that's where you can find the awstats documentation, apparently.  I've never installed it
[11:24] <dooglus> greenman: see also /etc/awstats/awstats.conf and /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local
[11:24] <kdt> dooglus: when I try to pm the contents of that log, it overflows and kicks me
[11:24] <Aachron> --am I in the right place to ask if there is a task sceduler? what did you mean by cron, njan
[11:24] <greenman> dooglus: i didn't find any help in there
[11:24] <dooglus> kdt, use a pastebin:
[11:25] <dooglus> !paste
[11:25] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[11:25] <kdt> ah
[11:25] <kdt> thanks
[11:27] <dooglus> Aachron: 'cron' is the linux task scheduler.  "man 5 crontab" will give the gory details; or if you can tell me what you want, I'll tell you how to do it
[11:27] <kdt> dooglus: ok there it is
[11:27] <njan> Aachron, like dooglus, cron is what linux and unix use to run tasks at specific times in a similar way to the task scheduler in windows.
[11:27] <njan> s/like dooglus/like dooglus says/
[11:28] <njan> Aachron, there are a number of different "cron" packages, but they all work in basically the same way, you can either read the man page or google cron online to find out more..
[11:28] <roadboy> hi guys
[11:29] <roadboy> anyone have configuration example for shaper?
[11:29] <dooglus> Aachron: anacron is good if you want to make sure something gets run every day - it makes sure the job gets run even if the PC isn't on at the same time each day
[11:29] <Aachron> thank-you
[11:30] <ekimus> hello, a question to the bind gurus: i have example.net and example.com - example.net is running fine with all RR records set, now I'm searching for an easy way so that $HOSTNAME.example.com will resolve to $HOSTNAME.example.net, so that I only need to update my example.net zone file and everything is fine
[11:30] <dooglus> greenman, do you see stuff at file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/awstats_setup.html ?  I see lots of help there
[11:31] <greenman> dooglus: I'm not finding anything about installing from apt-get install
[11:31] <greenman> dooglus: I found the awstats_configure.pl
[11:31] <dooglus> greenman: you install it like: "sudo apt-get install awstats"
[11:31] <greenman> but it won't run
[11:31] <greenman> I can't find the files it needs
[11:31] <dooglus> greenman: it gets run automatically periodically by cron
[11:31] <greenman> dooglus: I've done that
[11:32] <greenman> dooglus: I can't set it up because when I run awstats_configure.pl it errors out.
[11:32] <greenman> it can't find the files that it appends to the apache config
[11:32] <greenman> the "stuff" that makes awstats work
[11:33] <greenman> i "located" it and couldn't find anything
[11:33] <dooglus> greenman: I see.  let me try...
[11:33] <greenman> k
[11:33] <greenman> thanks
[11:35] <roadboy> anyone have configuration example for shaper package?
[11:37] <dooglus> greenman: looks like /usr/share/doc/awstats/README.Debian tells you how to set it up for ubuntu
[11:38] <greenman> dooglus: hmm... i didn't see what to do in there
[11:39] <dooglus> roadboy: did you see /usr/share/doc/shaper/README.shaper.gz
[11:39] <greenman> dooglus: that looks like just what to do if you encounter those problems
[11:40] <SurfnKid> how can i change the mac on my adapter
[11:40] <SurfnKid> and then embedd it
[11:40] <SurfnKid> macchange doesnt do it
[11:40] <BelialMkII> you could use ifconfig and pop it in one of the network scripts
[11:41] <roadboy> dooglus, yes but my english is not enough to understand it :(
[11:41] <greenman> screw it, I gotta go to bed.  I've been up over 24 hours
[11:41] <greenman> Thanks for the help dooglus
[11:42] <cccharles> I need help with a basic postfix config. anybody have time?
[11:43] <daurnimator> hi all

[11:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hiweed - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:48] <boink> ccharles: you could ask on #postfix too
[11:52] <tim167> when I open a *large* txt file my computer hangs completely, I have to quit gedit in terminal with kill comand...
[11:52] <dooglus> tim167: how large is large?
[11:52] <tim167> 131 MB
[11:52] <Daverocks> tim167: does "less" display it OK?
[11:52] <tim167> its a mail archive
[11:52] <Daverocks> try using less
[11:53] <Daverocks> less mailarchive.txt
[11:53] <tim167> can I search the textfile that way ?
[11:53] <dooglus> tim167: that is large.  most editors will try to fit the whole file into virtual memory at once, causing swapping, etc.  in less, type a slash '/' then the search string, and hit return
[11:53] <Daverocks> yeah, less can search
[11:53] <dooglus> tim167: then 'n' to go to the next match, and 'N' to go back to the previous
[11:53] <tim167> cool,  I'll try that
[11:54] <dooglus> it's a good question though.  is there an editor which will let me edit a huge file?  one that's bigger than available virtual memory?
[11:56] <Daverocks> i think vim would work well for that; i don't think it loads _everything_ into mem at once
[12:01] <piecewise> I don't suppose anyone here'd be able to help me out with what I am pretty sure is an ipv6 issue...?
[12:02] <GaiaX11> Who knows if there is a mplayer-gui in any ubuntu repository?
[12:02] <crimsun> it's the gmplayer binary in the mplayer package
[12:03] <mike1o> hi I hope somebody can help me solve my problem, I can't use my headphones... I have no "Headphone Jack Sense" on my volume control, my soundcard is SI7012
[12:04] <GaiaX11> crimsun: So I do apt-get install mplayer and ...
[12:04] <crimsun> GaiaX11: then execute ``gmplayer''
[12:04] <crimsun> GaiaX11: it's also in your menu
[12:04] <crimsun> mike1o: only your headphones (as in speakers work fine)?
[12:05] <defrysk> mike1o, also not in the switches section ?
[12:05] <mike1o> crimsun, my line out works fine
[12:05] <YogSothoth> hi
[12:06] <crimsun> mike1o: pastebin your amixer and lspci -nv
[12:06] <MasseR> Anyone here using nvidia-glx drivers with amaranth drivers?
[12:06] <defrysk> MasseR, yes
[12:06] <mike1o> defrysk, when i check my prefs there's no headphone control either
[12:06] <MasseR> defrysk: Your updated today/yesterday?
[12:06] <defrysk> MasseR, you can update safely from there now :)
[12:07] <MasseR> defrysk: Apparently you cant
[12:07] <MasseR> Mine's broken
[12:07] <MasseR> Segfaults even glxinfo
[12:07] <defrysk> MasseR, this morning the repo is back in sync with the edgy update
[12:08] <defrysk> MasseR, oh my , i havent rebooted yet ;(
[12:08] <mike1o> crimsun, amixer: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30603/
[12:08] <MasseR> defrysk: :P
[12:08] <defrysk> MasseR, I might be in trouble then :/
[12:08] <MasseR> defrysk: Try it. If it works, greta
[12:08] <MasseR> *great
[12:09] <defrysk> MasseR, no need to reboot now , My box is busy ;)
[12:09] <mike1o> crimsun, lspci -nv: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30604/
[12:10] <mike1o> cricht0ff, defrysk I heard there's a patch from alsa project that could fix the problem but i don't want to risk messing something up with the other apps
[12:12] <mike1o> crimsun, , defrysk I heard there's a patch from alsa project that could fix the problem but i don't want to risk messing something up with the other apps
[12:12] <defrysk> mike1o, not sure how to fix it , you could check in prefs of volumecontrol if jacksense is there so you can tic it to make it functional

[12:37] <Infecto> hi, does some body know how to export acounts in kmail ?
[12:38] <coz_> Ingmar, hold on
[12:38] <MasseR> Ingmar: The best way (if it works) is to install amaranth repos and install nvidia-glx
[12:38] <MasseR> Gets you the latest
[12:38] <aphone> hi all
[12:38] <Ingmar> MasseR: i'm using a repo, that contains a modified linux-restricted-modules, because i need it to use my wireless
[12:38] <coz_> Ingmar, do youwant the nividia beta drivers?
[12:38] <Ingmar> MasseR: that's what i'm doing, thanks for confirming
[12:38] <Ingmar> coz_: yes
[12:38] <MasseR> Ingmar: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/BerylOnEdgy
[12:38] <coz_> Ingmar, hold on
[12:38] <intehnet> ok! ubuntu under parallels does not work - graphics are pwned.
[12:39] <coz_> Ingmar,  try this   http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[12:39] <Ingmar> coz_: ok
[12:39] <gnomefreak> !nvidia-beta | Ingmar
[12:39] <ubotu> Ingmar: For Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), you can obtain the (unsupported!) Beta version of the binary NVidia drivers by using one of these repositories: "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com/ edgy lrm" (for x86) or "deb http://ubuntu.lupine.me.uk/ edgy lrm-amd64" (for AMD64)
[12:40] <Ingmar> thanks all :)
[12:40] <guillem101> gnomefreak, Impressive, there is a package for the 9629 driver for amd64 there :-)
[12:41] <ayaa> hello all

[12:41] <ayaa> tryng to install dapper on my new toshiba laptop, it allways freezes at 15%, how can i debug this problem
[12:41] <jazzrocker> does apt/synaptic keep temporary files around?
[12:41] <jazzrocker> can i clean them out?
[12:41] <guillem101> I've asked this at #ubuntu-xgl but never got an answer: what does the "--use-cow" option mean at beryl?
[12:42] <jazzrocker> it seems a little rediculous for my  main system to be using 50G
[12:42] <guillem101> ayaa, check the CD
[12:42] <ayaa> guillem101, it's not a CD related problem, i think of some unsupported hardware problem
[12:42] <guillem101> jazzrocker, I *think* it was "sudo apt-cache clean"
[12:43] <chx> is there a deb already for Nvidia 9629?
[12:43] <ayaa> guillem101, I have 5 new 'shipit' ubuntu CDs and they all throw that problem
[12:43] <rausb0> jazzrocker: apt-get clean

[12:46] <ayaa> anyone can help ?
[12:46] <Sutur> Trying to use the command cp to copy a large amount of files from one disk to a removable USB storage device (250GB hard drive), I have been having trouble with the device, so I have to keep restarting, so does the "cp" command automatically skip files that already exist?

[01:10] <jones20992> does it have more support for multimedia out of the box so to speak
[01:11] <DarkMageZ> jones20992, not that i'm aware of. but i doubt that will ever happen due to patents
[01:11] <shadukan_> soundray nice one
[01:12] <jones20992> i sure wish it would do xvid out of the box sure would make my life easyr

[01:13] <shadukan_> i have done all the tests and the damn thing still crashed
[01:14] <sundari> i just installed rtorrent via synaptic PM... now how do I run it?
[01:14] <jones20992> xvid is a free ver of divx

[01:16] <guillem101> since my upgrade to edgy, I can only see in nautilus some of the folders at root level (I don't see /usr or /tmp) unless I enable "show hidden files". Is this a common problem?
[01:16] <sundari> i just installed rtorrent via synaptic PM... now how do I run it?
[01:16] <somejew-sdidwtc> i dont know
[01:16] <variant> jones20992: yes, it's not somthing worth spending thought-time on though
[01:17] <soundray> sundari: it often helps to list the package files, e.g. 'dpkg -L packagename | grep bin/ '
[01:19] <soundray> sundari: I guess in the case of rtorrent, you just have to enter rtorrent in a terminal window.
[01:19] <sundari> there is no gui?
[01:20] <somejew-sdidwtc> there is no guy
[01:20] <soundray> sundari: the description says that it is curses-based, so there is a text-based gui.
[01:20] <ailean> I would like to gauge the concensus on what is the best ubuntu-friendly piece of software for managing money.  I am used to Microsoft Money, and would like something with all of the features in that if possible (i.e. reports, charts etc)
[01:20] <sundari> so... what is a nice torrent software? used to utorrent...
[01:21] <variant> ailean: gnucash is about it really

[01:35] <shawnr_> wtf
[01:35] <cheesy> quit now
[01:35] <ailean> Vista is apparently going to come with a domain name for every computer to access the files remotely - does Ubuntu have anything planned to keep up with this?
[01:35] <floating> i would rather download the debs and burn them to a disk, but I can get to ethernet if this method is impossible
[01:36] <shawnr_> i waited 3 days to install the new nvidia xgl and linux-restricted-modules updates, i do and my xserver crashes
[01:36] <soundray> floating: there is a how-to for using apt offline, let me dig it out...
[01:36] <shawnr_> can anyone help me out
[01:36] <floating> hmm, well, I have got that
[01:37] <soundray> floating: what's the problem, then?
[01:37] <floating> soundray: hmm, will it find the packages with apt-get libc-dev and libc6-dev and g++ as package names ?
[01:38] <ailean> Jazon, I dunno, I don't see anything in KMyMoney to create graphs etc.  It doesn't seem very graphical.  Am I missing something?
[01:38] <soundray> floating: I don't understand the question.
[01:38] <floating> i didnt think the apt-get offline would be useful
[01:39] <floating> cuz I dont understand.. didnt read the page
[01:39] <shawnr_> Where can I find the log for the xserver?
[01:39] <soundray> shawnr_: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[01:39] <shawnr_> thanx
[01:39] <ekimus> if i have a nameserver for 192.0.2.0/29 is it ok if i specify the reverse lookup zone like this: zone "2.0.192in-addr.arpa" or do I have to care about the netmask of the assigned range?
[01:40] <floating> soundray: so if I go to ethernet, just apt-get install libc6-dev , apt-get install libc-dev and apt-get install g++ will be correct commands ?
[01:40] <priich> any tips on what to do when the xserver-xorg packages is being held back when i try to upgrade to edgy ?

[01:41] <somejew-sdidwtc>  http://danke-peer.dl.am/ geil
[01:42] <soundray> floating: no, if you are on ethernet, 'apt-get install build-essential' should be sufficient.
[01:42] <floating> ohhh
[01:42] <floating> thanks
[01:43] <soundray> priich: 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg' should either install it or tell you why it won't.

[01:49] <soundray> Thanks Hobbsee
[01:49] <soundray> :)
[01:49] <shawnr_> my xserver just crashed but I can't find the log for it. i looked in Xorg.0.log
[01:49] <shawnr_> is there somewhere else i should look?
[01:51] <soundray> shawnr_: are you running Xgl?
[01:51] <shawnr_> not anymore glx
[01:51] <shawnr_> i got rid of xgl
[01:51] <shawnr_> a while ago
[01:51] <shawnr_> i just installed the latest nvidia-glx update
[01:52] <shawnr_> and it crashed
[01:52] <soundray> shawnr_: do a 'ls -l /var/log/X*' to see if you have any other X-related logs, and whether they show today's date.
[01:52] <shawnr_> so i switched it to the 'nv' driver
[01:53] <shawnr_> soundray, which is an error... II == ** WW ?
[01:54] <soundray> shawnr_: if you're examining a crash, all of these could be interesting. Just look at the end of the file.
[01:54] <ekimus> hehe that link from somejew-sdidwtc is actually a thank you page for a german politician who prevented a beer tax :)
[01:55] <shawnr_> soundray, yea here it is
[01:55] <soundray> shawnr_: the markers are explained in the first few lines of the file.
[01:55] <shawnr_> ahhh
[01:55] <priich> ekimus, always a worthy cause, fighting beer taxes
[01:57] <shawnr_> soundray, i found the error but it isn't telling me anything really specific
[01:57] <shawnr_> this sux i have school work to do today lol
[01:58] <XiXaQ> What is Nice in System monitor?
[01:58] <soundray> shawnr_: configure vesa instead of nv and see if you still get the crash.
[01:58] <soundray> XiXaQ: process priority
[01:58] <shawnr_> soundray, it isn't telling me what it said at the time of crash
[01:59] <XiXaQ> soundray, thanks :)
[01:59] <shawnr_> soundray, it said the nvidia-glx version and a version of something else doesn't match
[01:59] <XiXaQ> soundray, more is higher priority?
[02:00] <soundray> shawnr_: did you install the ubuntu packages to get nvidia support?
[02:00] <shawnr_> ubuntu
[02:00] <geokok> hi. Just a quick question. I have the repos nvidia drivers installed. Do I have to uninstall them before installing the new ones form nvidia?
[02:00] <shawnr_> i think
[02:00] <soundray> XiXaQ: default is 0, negative is higher, positive is lower priority.
[02:00] <Martie> wow, ubuntu conversations get higher priority that school work :) your mom's gonna be mad
[02:01] <XiXaQ> soundray, thanks again :)
[02:01] <shawnr_> soundray, nvidia-glx (1.0.8762+2.6.15.11-5) to 1.0.8776+2.6.15.12-1
[02:01] <soundray> XiXaQ: man nice, man renice
[02:01] <shawnr_> let me try again
[02:01] <geokok> Do I simpy uninstall the nvidia-glx from synaptic and I am fine?
[02:01] <soundray> shawnr_: where did you download those drivers?
[02:02] <shawnr_> automatic updates
[02:02] <shawnr_> soundray, do the linux restricted modules need a reboot to register with the system?
[02:02] <julo> moin moin
[02:02] <shawnr_> cause after the update i restarted x
[02:02] <shawnr_> no reboot
[02:02] <clode_> hey, anyone have a suggestion to a good FTP software for Linux?
[02:02] <soundray> shawnr_: yes, that was going to be my next suggestion
[02:02] <shawnr_> ak
[02:02] <shawnr_> k
[02:03] <shawnr_> abrb, thanx
[02:03] <julo> clode_: nautilus handles ftp pretty well
[02:03] <julo> clode_: else, there is gftp
[02:03] <clode_> oh, thanks for the suggestions. I'll check them out.
[02:03] <dooglus> clode_: lftp is the best command line tool I've found - it's very nice
[02:04] <clode_> ah, alright - is it easy to configure the way you want it to dooglus?
[02:04] <dooglus> clode_: I didn't look into it much - I use tramp in Emacs for all my FTP needs
[02:04] <clode_> oKtosiTe-server:)
[02:04] <dooglus> clode_: but that's probably too much of an acquired taste
[02:04] <gharz> guys, i'm using gnome... how do i install KDE?
[02:04] <dooglus> gharz: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[02:05] <gharz> dooglus, thanks!!!!
[02:05] <dooglus> gharz: that'll bring in a whole bunch of KDE apps as well.  if you just want the basics, there's something called - um 'kdebase' maybe?
[02:05] <gharz> yeah... i just want the kdebase.
[02:05] <dooglus> !info kdebase
[02:05] <ubotu> kdebase: base components from the official KDE release. In component main, is optional. Version 4:3.5.5-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 45 kB, installed size 88 kB
[02:05] <dooglus> gharz: so just "sudo apt-get kdebase" then
[02:05] <mike1o> no sound from headphone jack, no headphone control in alsamixer either! card; SI7012
[02:06] <soundray> !kde-core | gharz
[02:06] <ubotu> kde-core: the K Desktop Environment core modules. In component main, is optional. Version 5:47 (edgy), package size 7 kB, installed size 40 kB
[02:06] <dooglus> oops.  you'll need "install" in there too - before "kdebase"
[02:09] <floating> soundray: I am online now with my xubuntu. I installed build-essential, it mentioned the earlier deb I had problems with and suggested apt-get -f install, I did that and then tried a new build-essential install, it says that build-essential is not available but is referred to by another package E: package build-essential has no installation candidate
[02:09] <gharz> soundray, what's the difference between kde-core and kdebase?
[02:09] <soundray> gharz: sry, forget about kde-core, kdebase is what you need.
[02:09] <Laibsch> Is it possible to import a GPG key for a repository but NOT trust that GPG when installing files?  "gpg --import $file" imports the file but has no other effect on apt function.
[02:09] <soundray> floating: 'sudo apt-get update', then try again
[02:10] <gharz> soundray, what's the diff between the two then?
[02:10] <gharz> soundray, coz i'd like to switch between kde and gnome during logon.
[02:11] <soundray> gharz: you will be able to do that in gdm
[02:11] <floating> thank you, seems to work soundray
[02:11] <gharz> soundray, ok... thanks!
=== gorilla_ is now known as gorilla
[02:15] <dooglus> gharz: kde-core = kdebase + arts + kdelibs
[02:16] <gharz> dooglus, thanks for the info!
[02:16] <jenda> The Czech LoCo team has been asked in an interview what progress has been made towards new-user-accessibility in Edgy (for which Ubuntu is renowned). Anyone have any tips?
[02:16] <dooglus> ahoj jenda!
[02:16] <jenda> :)
[02:19] <jenda> Is it possible that 8 minutes of conversation fit on a single screen in #ubuntu?
[02:19] <jenda> What's wrong with the world?

[02:26] <dh> does it run that hot all the time, or just when spinning?
[02:26] <Faithful> dh: well usually it is spinning when it is running.
[02:27] <dh> so its burning hot even in standby then?
[02:29] <ailean> Faithful, it should not be that hot

[02:34] <Tim90> tryed sh runLime.sh
[02:34] <morphycs> dooglus: I don't know what frinstance is

[02:34] <boink> so that mplayer can play windows media stuff
[02:34] <dooglus> morphycs: an example.  of a format you can't play

[02:36] <dooglus> morphycs: oh.  mpg works for me

[02:36] <Tim90> for me
[02:36] <boink> what does apt-cace search limewire say?
[02:36] <boink> apt-cache I mean
[02:36] <dooglus> pedrolopes10: you can try
[02:37] <dooglus> pedrolopes10: you have to be registered, or it won't let you
[02:37] <pedrolopes10> ok sorry  i will register now
[02:37] <Tim90> root@timo900-desktop:/usr/local/LimeWire# sudo  apt-cace search LimeWire

[02:37] <dooglus> Tim90: cache, not cace
[02:37] <boink> apt-cache search limewire
[02:37] <boink> it was a typo
[02:38] <dooglus> morphycs: what error do you see if you run "mplayer file.mpg"?
[02:38] <GnarusLeo> Hi! Does anyone know why my fonts look like crap in amsn? Where can I get normal fonts? or how? Its programmed in TK/TCL (I think thats whats wrong)

[02:38] <Tim90> root@timo900-desktop:/usr/local/LimeWire
[02:38] <francix> hi
[02:38] <boink> that means it doesn't exist in any of the repos you use
[02:39] <boink> you need to fine an ubuntu repo which has limewire
[02:39] <morphycs> dooglus: "error opening/initialize the selected video_out (-vo) device."
[02:39] <boink> I got no reply as well for limewire
[02:39] <pouUbun2> hi question about toshiba laptop sat. p100. I tried ver 6.06 and ver 6.10 and sound dont seem to be working at all... anyone else has that prob?
[02:39] <boink> what does cat /dev/sndstat say?
[02:40] <boink> (don't paste!)
[02:40] <dooglus> morphycs: which -vo device are you trying to use?
[02:40] <Tim90> boink: i downloaded it from the limewire site,
[02:40] <dooglus> morphycs: try "mplayer -vo x11 file.mpg" for example
[02:40] <francix> ive just managed to mount my ntfs drive for reading (very proud btw) , is it dangerous to transfer files from there to my linux partition on ubuntu?
[02:40] <boink> the ubuntu .deb? or just the source code?
[02:41] <njan> francix, no, that's safe.
[02:41] <Tim90>  fracix: yes never write on the ntfs
[02:41] <francix> na just want to transfer files from ntfs to linux
[02:41] <francix> thanks
[02:41] <Tim90> ok
[02:41] <boink> francix: ideally, that nfs share should now be a part of your system
[02:42] <morphycs> dooglus: It work now, how to set this parameters by default
[02:42] <francix> boink, i think it is, as i'm listening to my mp3 from there now, just wanted to be sure :)
[02:42] <Tim90> were can i get the limewire  repo
[02:42] <boink> I listen to mp3's all the time off samba mounts ;)
[02:42] <boink> Tim90: google
[02:42] <boink> limewire ubuntu
[02:43] <gyaresu> !flash > gyaresu
[02:44] <geokok> how come I cant get a public key for the beerorokid repo????
[02:44] <francix> woohoo, copying files to linux fro ntrf works like a dream, ubuntu ftw!
[02:45] <dooglus> morphycs: -vo x11 is a bit slow - try -vo xv instead - does that work?
[02:45] <Lobster> geokok if you use apt-get update there should be shown the key
[02:45] <boink> francix: you mean ntfs?
[02:45] <gyaresu> Tim90, It's called frostwire
[02:45] <boink> ntrf?
[02:45] <geokok> no i get a message at the end saying to run sudo apt get update.....
[02:45] <francix> ntfs i meant ;P
[02:46] <boink> frnacix: if you're paranoid, you might want to consider sshfs later on
[02:46] <andrepowell> one more question is there a way to run "Install" w/o the mouse ?
[02:46] <boink> that's ntfs by ssh protocol
[02:46] <Tim90> gyaresu: Cheers
[02:46] <gyaresu> geokok, wget http://www.beerorkid.com/compiz/quinn.key.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add -
[02:46] <gyaresu> Tim90, welcome
[02:46] <jrib> ubotu: tell andrepowell about apt
[02:47] <Lobster> can you paste, geokok?
[02:47] <geokok> gyaresu: I have added that
[02:47] <Lobster> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[02:47] <gyaresu> andrepowell, disable mouse?
[02:47] <geokok> Lobster: give me a sec cause the terminal is installing the nvidia drivers
[02:48] <andrepowell> gyaresu: my mouse will not work with LiveCD, and I want to see if I can install Ubuntu sometime this year
[02:48] <francix> infidel windows partition !
[02:48] <francix> boink, yep
[02:49] <andrepowell> gyaresu: btw it is an non-usb optical
[02:49] <gyaresu> andrepowell, you could install the server edition and then setup your own xorg.conf
[02:49] <morphycs> dooglus: Ok I set vx in the preference and its playing files very well but when I open the files it say "couldn't open codecs", but it plays file normally
[02:49] <gyaresu> andrepowell, should just work.
[02:49] <dooglus> morphycs: to make the option default, put a line saying "vo=x11" in ~/.mplayer/config
[02:49] <dooglus> morphycs: or "vo=xv" if that works
[02:49] <clojster> hi, how can i define aliases? I tried to put them in ~/.bashrc but it doesn't work
[02:49] <oangefly> as administrator, how do i acces other peoples personal folders using my login from other computers....???....
[02:50] <axion_> how come almost every single package is listed as auto-removable? if i do autoremove my system will stop working (glibc etc!)
[02:50] <dooglus> clojster: alias x='echo hello'
[02:50] <oangefly> server of course....
[02:50] <Tim90> I have the mce remote connected to ubuntu, were is the device alocated i.e /dev/ttyusb
[02:50] <gyaresu> clojster, yes it does. you need to start a new 'bash' session.
[02:50] <evilghost> oangefly:  If you're using gnome login and try "sudo nautilus", if you're using console, then "sudo su" and just CD into their directories.
[02:50] <clojster> gyaresu: I did
[02:50] <gyaresu> oangefly, just 'ls'
[02:51] <andrepowell> gyaresu: this is what I have 196 MB Ram PII 6xx  processor 10G of space and a big headache, is there something that I am missing.
[02:51] <mrdude> something in edgy thats different than dapper is messing with my USB webcam being able to work with VMware
[02:51] <boink> clojster: source .bashrc
[02:51] <morphycs> dooglus: Its say the same error, "couldn't open codecs", but its plays the file very well
[02:51] <mrdude> anyone know what this might be?
[02:51] <gyaresu> andrepowell, loads to desktop but you just can't use the mouse?
[02:51] <oangefly> i mean from computers running windows....or do i have to use putty....
[02:51] <axion_> anyone have any clue how to fix my packages?
[02:51] <dooglus> morphycs: I ignore all the junk that mplayer prints so long as the file plays OK...
[02:51] <sc4ttrbrain> mrdude, can u use it to send voices?
[02:51] <evilghost> oangefly:  If the server is runing openSSH then yes, you can use putty.
[02:52] <gyaresu> morphycs, you have the extra codecs installed?
[02:52] <clojster> boink: still nothing
[02:52] <gyaresu> axion_, specifics please.
[02:52] <andrepowell> gyaresu: there is a pointer but no movement
[02:52] <mrdude> i noticed that when i plug it in now i get a dialog to open digital camera photos wondering if maybe that is taking it over
[02:52] <axion_> gyaresu: read up
[02:52] <mrdude> no
[02:52] <clojster> this is line in my .bashrc:
[02:52] <axion_> how come almost every single package is listed as auto-removable? if i do autoremove my system will stop working (glibc etc!)
[02:52] <mrdude> its actually a dig camera/webcam combo
[02:52] <boink> for bash, it should be = alias blah="ssh -v -l blah blah.com"
[02:52] <clojster> alias mplayer='mplayer -monitorpixelaspect 1'
[02:52] <oangefly> i was just hoping i could access everybodies home folder from anyones windows explorer....
[02:52] <mrdude> it worked fine in dapper but now vmware isnt seeing it
[02:52] <boink> clojster: try it with quotes
[02:52] <Wikzo> can you see this?
[02:52] <gyaresu> axion_, what are you trying to do?
[02:53] <boink> then source .bashrc
[02:53] <axion_> gyaresu: trying to use autoremove without it removing everything
[02:53] <morphycs> dooglus: how to make mplayer the default mozilla-plugin?
[02:53] <evilghost> oangefly:  You'd have to have Samba installed to do that
[02:53] <oangefly> i do....
[02:53] <clojster> boink: still nothing
[02:53] <sc4ttrbrain> mrdude, what version of vmware?

[03:00] <axion_> gyaresu: probably removed a pseudo package i wasnt supposed to remove
[03:00] <gyaresu> axion_, what about when you 'apt-get update' 'apt-get upgrade'
[03:00] <gnomefreak> rolando: the commands i gave you need to be ran in terminal
[03:00] <axion_> gyaresu: no sources.list is the default
[03:00] <Lobster> geokok  gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv 31A5F97FED8A569E

[03:06] <boink> and there's nothing using the card
[03:06] <gyaresu> otacon22_, ipkungfu isn't easy enough?
[03:07] <boink> gnomefreak: firefox is not. I've closed it
[03:07] <gnomefreak> boink: are you sure firefox isnt using it? and what version of ubuntu
[03:07] <boink> 6.06 LTS
[03:07] <otacon22_> gyaresu, no, and I haven't finded documentation to use it
[03:07] <gnomefreak> boink: just because you closed it doesnt mean its not running
[03:07] <boink> firefox and opera I've closed.
[03:07] <boink> it's not in ps aux
[03:07] <oangefly> it's the only thing i haven't been able to do....i thought it may come in handy if someone doesn't show up at work and i need to retrieve someing, and i don't have my laptop or their password with me....
[03:07] <boink> /etc/init.d/alsa-utils reset does nothing as well
[03:08] <gyaresu> oangefly, If you just want root access then you don't really want to be using samba...
[03:08] <gnomefreak> boink: is /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p in ps aux?
[03:08] <boink> i'll check
[03:09] <gyaresu> otacon22_, I know it's a little like jumping in the deep end but I recommend reading up on netfilter.

[03:11] <priich> boink, have you tried MAKEDEV ?
[03:11] <boink> it shouldn't crash on me like that
[03:11] <gnomefreak> snowshoefox: putty and i think that would be on lines of a windows support question more so than ubuntu
[03:11] <gyaresu> snowshoefox, File sharing? Or what?
[03:11] <mrmist> er... to the windows that are minimized
[03:11] <otacon22_> gyaresu, you really don't know how I have to do after had installed ipkungfu and lunched it?

[03:13] <Feonix762> mrmist, doesn't work :(
[03:13] <gnomefreak> boink: i know
[03:13] <gyaresu> otacon22_, you need to read the man... 'man ipkungfu'
[03:13] <snowshoefox> nm, i'll try freenx
[03:13] <boink> could I kill esd? is that something to do with sound?
[03:13] <gyaresu> snowshoefox, RDP from windows >> linux  ??
[03:13] <gnomefreak> yes
[03:13] <Feonix762> I need to build a module using the same version of GCC that was used to compile the kernel or it won't work
[03:13] <floating> My ndiswrapper problem; I installed drivers to it, then modprobe it, but it doesnt initialize wlan0 like it should I guess... with iwconfig there is wlan information on eth1, and it wont work as I try use that instead
[03:13] <snowshoefox> yes gyaresu
[03:13] <Feonix762> How can I figure out what version of GCC was used to compile the kernel?
[03:13] <gnomefreak> boink: yes esd is sound
[03:14] <gnomefreak> !esd | boink
[03:14] <ubotu> boink: esd is the enlightened sound deamon. It's deprecated, use !alsa instead
[03:14] <boink> heh, killed it

[03:14] <ubotu> freenx is advanced remote desktop technology. For more information and install instructions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX

[03:14] <snowshoefox> :)
[03:14] <Plzr> yes
[03:14] <bluefox83> Feonix762, what module?
[03:14] <gnomefreak> boink: sound should work unless something else is using it
[03:14] <Feonix762> madwifi drivers
[03:14] <gnomefreak> boink: a good idea if you can change it from esd to alsa (the drivers)
[03:14] <bluefox83> hrm
[03:14] <boink> nope.
[03:14] <boink> hmm .. ok, I'll look into that
[03:15] <aldwin> yo wassup
[03:15] <boink> I've just been using the 6.06 LTS install
[03:15] <gyaresu> snowshoefox, Well would need to be running vnc client or something.
[03:15] <bluefox83> Feonix762, you might try doing apt-cache show <kernel)
[03:15] <bluefox83> *>
[03:15] <gnomefreak> boink: than there is something else using it. (/usr/bin) should be using it just not sure what /usr/bin/* it is
[03:15] <axion_> boink: does alsamixer load?
[03:15] <boink> well .. I killed esd
[03:15] <Faithful> Feonix762: cat /proc/version
[03:16] <boink> and now it says "resource busy" and would even play the sound as well
[03:16] <boink> I've never seen this in any open source distro

[03:21] <abhinay> Hi there
[03:21] <abhinay> my friend is unable to boot in to edgy, because of xorg fail. that errors are : (EE) VESA(0): No matching modes  , (EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration. Fatal server error: no screens found
[03:21] <abhinay> Any idea ?
[03:22] <gnomefreak> priich: btw setting the driver to vesa should give you X
[03:22] <gyaresu> !pastebin > abhinay
[03:22] <gyaresu> abhinay, let's have a look.
[03:22] <abhinay> gyaresu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30624/
[03:22] <gnomefreak> abhinay: install xserver-xorg-video-all
[03:22] <diminthedam> hello. How do i update my wireless driver on thinkpad?
[03:22] <priich> gnomefreak, when i do xset fp -rehash, i get bad font element #76. directory missing or do not exist, or has wrong permissions or directory missing fonts.dir or incorrect font server address or syntax
[03:22] <gnomefreak> abhinay: also make sure BusID is right
[03:23] <gyaresu> gnomefreak, Is that just ALL the xorg packages as a metapackage?
[03:23] <Ayabara> is there more to 'movie player' than meets the eye? can I make it more configurable?
[03:23] <gnomefreak> priich: open synaptic and search for fonts install the ones you need
[03:23] <gnomefreak> gyaresu: no thats all the drivers packages
[03:23] <gyaresu> ah.
[03:24] <gnomefreak> gyaresu: what used to be xserver-xorg-driver-nv is now xserver-xorg-video-nv  replace nv for all and it will install all of them nv vesa mesa so on
[03:24] <Ayabara> anyone? is there an irc channel for totem movie player?
[03:24] <jrib> Ayabara: not really, try, mplayer, vlc, gxine, xine-ui
[03:24] <gyaresu> gnomefreak, thanks. interesting.
[03:25] <Ayabara> jrib: ok. thanks. I'm on kaffeine now, but it keeps crashing on wmv files...
[03:25] <gyaresu> abhinay, try gnomefreak idea. ^^
[03:25] <abhinay> gyaresu: ok
[03:25] <gnomefreak> abhinay: if this was an upgrade you may need more packages.
[03:25] <priich> gnomefreak, hehe well that is kind of the problem. gksudo synaptic gives : received an X window system error. error was badname, font or color does not exist
[03:26] <gnomefreak> priich: forgot your in tty
[03:26] <gnomefreak> priich: apt-cache search fonts | less than use the page dwn key to scroll
[03:26] <abhinay> gnomefreak: edgy is fresh installed. btw, what is BusID ?
[03:27] <priich> gnomefreak, yeah i did that. seems i have all the packages installed that should give the fonts listed when i do "xset q"
[03:27] <gnomefreak> abhinay: in /etc/X11/xorg you will see a line under device (driver) BusID PCI:...... that needs to match what pci slot the card is in
[03:27] <gnomefreak> oops
[03:27] <abhinay> ok
[03:27] <gnomefreak> abhinay: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:28] <gnomefreak> abhinay: lspci should give you the busid number
[03:28] <gnomefreak> abhinay: it will look like 02:02:0
[03:29] <gnomefreak> abhinay: not that exact number but should look simular. if you see a letter in there let me know but iirc edgy shows it as it needs to be not in hex dec
[03:29] <bossjock77> Mornin' all.
[03:30] <bossjock77> I need some help.  :-)

[03:34] <djuuss> How do i install and setup a new Grub from the live cd? Already have a 6.06 installation but its GRUB and Fstab are FUBAR
[03:34] <boink> dang it, need to reboot. almost as lame as windows.
[03:34] <gyaresu> bossjock77, you can. /etc/X11/xorg.conf (be sure to backup first)
[03:34] <dv5237> bossjock77: you can adjust xorg.conf by entering 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' im not sure how that would work though changing the resolution on the CLI
[03:35] <dv5237> boink: lol yeah almost ;x

[03:37] <Yancho> gyaresu so u suggest i go and ask in #apche ? is it something i can do apt-get install pls ?
[03:37] <bossjock77> It says I need to install new drivers for my video card... how do I do that from the CLI?
[03:37] <snowshoefox> dangit... who changed my su pw
[03:38] <iwkse> gyaresu: no..on my laptop works great, and there's ubuntu egty too..right the same as on pc
[03:38] <gyaresu> Yancho, apt-get "information", no. You can find out how to use them from apache.org however.
[03:38] <djuuss> gyaresu, thanks that 'recovering ubuntu after installing windows' link really helped :D (not that i installed.. *shudder* windows)
[03:38] <BeanBag> jrib:????
[03:38] <gyaresu> djuuss, cool.
[03:39] <csirstepri> hi
[03:39] <csirstepri> how are you all

[03:39] <mike1o> any edgy users here? please post output of cat /proc/asound/version ...
[03:39] <gyaresu> iwkse, checked 'dmesg' and 'messages' ?

[03:40] <gyaresu> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.12rc1 (Thu Jun 22 13:55:50 2006 UTC).
[03:40] <csirstepri> frank
[03:40] <dv5237> mike1o: sudo: /proc/asound/version: command not found
[03:40] <csirstepri> and you
[03:40] <bossjock77> I think I need to study up on how to use this CLI.
[03:40] <thartman> sudo apt-get update keeps timing out with "99%... waiting for headers" -- http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/NnC0SS24.html
[03:40] <gyaresu> mike1o, ^^
[03:40] <mike1o> dv5237, did u write cat before it?
[03:40] <thartman> is there something wrong with de.archive.ubuntu.com ?
[03:40] <thartman> i'm on dapper drake
[03:41] <dv5237> mike1o: im sorry i forgot >> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.12rc1 (Thu Jun 22 13:55:50 2006 UTC).
[03:41] <gyaresu> bossjock77, cool commands: man, locate (updatedb), apropos
[03:41] <jrib> BeanBag: did you receive a private message from ubotu?
[03:41] <djuuss> In fstab, how do i mount a swap space? mount it to 'none' with type 'swap'  or mount it to 'swap' with type 'swap'
[03:41] <mike1o> ok tnx dv5237 its not a virus any way in case you're worried :-)
[03:41] <Plzr> I installed drivers for my wificard, they should be right ndiswrapper says driver present/hardware present but how do I make the drivers work for my card now
[03:42] <dv5237> mike1o: i wassnt ;)
[03:42] <aldwin> is ubuntu a ntfs format or a fat32?
[03:42] <mike1o> dv5237, i know...
[03:42] <mike1o> aldwin, ??
[03:42] <dv5237> mike1o: good :x
[03:42] <gyaresu> djuuss, UUID=a6c99ffb-7f1b-4c05-befd-14179fd4979f none swap sw 0 0
[03:42] <mike1o> aldwin, ext3
[03:42] <Yancho> aldwin :S pls :(
[03:42] <djuuss> aldwin: it defaults to ext3 i think. So neither fat32 nor ntfs
[03:42] <bossjock77> Well... I ran sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx on the CLI... and it's doing SOMETHING.
[03:42] <iwkse> gyaresu: i get a lot of this [17179579.200000]  usb 4-6: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
[03:42] <Plzr> if I want to activate eth1 via networkadmin this doesnt work correct
[03:42] <gyaresu> djuuss, where UUID is the swap partition.
[03:42] <iwkse> just changing the address 2
[03:42] <bossjock77> Whether or not it's what I need to do... I'll find out.  :-P
[03:42] <Tjoels> what should i use for beryl? glx, aiglx or the nvidia beta drivers. i'm on edgy.
[03:43] <djuuss> gyaresu thx
[03:43] <gyaresu> iwkse, that's good.
[03:43] <elro> what are <release>-updates?
[03:43] <iwkse> with progressive numbers
[03:43] <gyaresu> djuuss, no probs.
[03:43] <aldwin> whats ext3 is it a new format that i dont know since i only know fat16, fat32 and ntfs... (im using ubuntu now)
[03:43] <iwkse> till 171
[03:43] <djuuss> Gonna logout now and rescue with the install cd :) thanks gyaresu
[03:43] <elro> aldwin: ext3 is the linux filesystem format
[03:43] <Tjoels> aldwin: it's the most widely used file system for linux, i think
[03:43] <gyaresu> aldwin, ext3 is the 'standard' file system for linux. (there are many others)
[03:44] <BeanBag> jrib: no i did not
[03:44] <aldwin> ah okay, ext3 is the most used. ah okay, thank you very...
[03:44] <aldwin> very very much
[03:44] <Tjoels> :)
[03:44] <Tjoels> np
[03:44] <Plzr> if I try to activate eth1 (my wificard) via Network Settings it takes a really long time to activatebut when I start up my network settings again its still not active
[03:44] <iwkse> gyaresu: how i can check what problem could be?
[03:44] <gyaresu> iwkse, usb?
[03:45] <iwkse> gyaresu: do you mean a problem with usb port^?
[03:45] <aldwin> can ext3 (file format of linux. Thus, ubuntu) can mount/understand ntfs???
[03:45] <gyaresu> iwkse, 'tail -f /var/log/message' then stick it in.
[03:45] <Tjoels> aldwin, yea, it can, but not with full support i think
[03:45] <phaedrus44> aldwin:  firts off there is ext2 also ...   and yes ntfs reading and writing is possible
[03:45] <gyaresu> iwkse, 'dmesg | less' and you should see it come up with a drive && partition number sdd1 etc.
[03:46] <elro> ah updates are major bug fixes produced after final release
[03:46] <gyaresu> aldwin, no Tjoels the kernel can.
[03:46] <XiXaQ> Isn't there a harddrive manager in edgy?
[03:46] <gyaresu> aldwin, Tjoels ext3 is just a file system.
[03:47] <gyaresu> !ntfs-3g > aldwin Tjoels
[03:47] <Tjoels> gyaresu, hehe, i know.
[03:47] <aldwin> phaedrus44, so is it possible if i have a ntfs hard disk and i plug it here in my pc running ext3(which is my ubuntu) will i be able to modify anything from that old hard disk (ntfs)???
[03:47] <iwkse> gyaresu: mm.--[17179579.200000]  usb 4-6: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
[03:47] <bossjock77> OK... ran the updated nVidia drivers... and the monitor is still shutting off.
[03:47] <iwkse> ops..
[03:47] <iwkse> gyaresu: [17180124.460000]  hub 4-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 5.  Maybe the USB cable is
[03:47] <iwkse> bad?
[03:47] <gyaresu> bossjock77, nvidia card with two digital outs?
[03:48] <XiXaQ> aldwin, it is possible, yes. You can mount your C:\ in a folder in your filesystem, for instance, /media/windows
[03:48] <gyaresu> iwkse, back usb port is it? or a front?
[03:48] <bossjock77> n... one analog and one digital.  I'm using the analog.
[03:48] <iwkse> gyaresu: its a front port
[03:48] <netpython> bossjock77, hor and vert frequecies of your monitor set right in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[03:48] <aldwin> ah okay... i'll try that...
[03:48] <iwkse> gyaresu: i try to put it back...
[03:48] <aldwin> thank you very much
[03:48] <gyaresu> iwkse, try the back. front are usually crappy headers.
[03:48] <davvs> is there any nice command to make the computer "say/pronounce" a custom sentence?
[03:48] <iwkse> gyaresu: yeah
[03:48] <bossjock77> Hang on... I'll look.

[03:52] <gyaresu> bossjock77, backup first.
[03:52] <imperfect-> Anyone here know how I can update from breezy to edgy on a remote server?
[03:52] <netpython> bossjock77, sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:52] <jrib> bossjock77: use 'gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf'  if you don't know how to use vi
[03:52] <Cieffe> It goes timeout trying connecting :(
[03:52] <gyaresu> jrib, bossjock77 If you don't know vi then try 'vimtutor' first ;)

[03:54] <priich> hehe kind of evil recommending vim as an editor for someone that isn't all that experienced with *nix. :)
[03:55] <fblade> sorry i meant why when ever i log-out from ubuntu does my Monitor go into standby mode, could i have a problem with my drivers?
[03:55] <gyaresu> Materazzi, try other repos.
[03:55] <gyaresu> priich, how else does one get experienced?
[03:55] <Materazzi> gyaresu, oh yeah...
[03:55] <[H] 3b0R> how can change the color to the font on the menu line?
[03:56] <Tjoels> Should i install Beryl together with GLX or AIGLX?
[03:56] <[H] 3b0R> Tjoels: waht grapcis card do you have?
[03:56] <jvolkman> Tjoels, you mean XGL?
[03:56] <mamonassassina> hello,what command should I use to open blender in "windowed" mode?
[03:56] <gyaresu> Tjoels, I wouldn't bother. That's just me.
[03:56] <Tjoels> [H] 3b0R it's Nvidia
[03:57] <[H] 3b0R> tjoels: aiglx
[03:57] <Tjoels> jvolkman, yeah, it was a typo
[03:57] <gyaresu> !beryl > Tjoels
[03:58] <Tjoels> [H] 3b0R, okay, but what's the difference between them?
[03:58] <gyaresu> mamonassassina, tried the blender manual?
[03:58] <bossjock77> Reconfigured so that it defaults to 1024 x 768.
[03:58] <priich> gyaresu, one step at the time ?
[03:58] <bossjock77> Rebooted... screen still dead.
[03:58] <gyaresu> Tjoels, there is an #ubuntu-xgl channel
[03:59] <[H] 3b0R> Tjoels: AIGLX is a part of the graphics driver XGL, is just an hack that gives nothing than issues
[03:59] <mamonassassina> gyaresu: let me see
[03:59] <Tjoels> gyaresu: ok, i'll go there ;)
[03:59] <gyaresu> priich, exactly. starting with a text editor...
[03:59] <mamonassassina> gyaresu: but a simple command in the properties of the shortcut makes it open in windowed.
[03:59] <[H] 3b0R> Tjoels: im there to...
[04:00] <Tjoels> [H] 3b0R, ok, great
[04:00] <gyaresu> mamonassassina, Is that an answer? Did you find the solution?
[04:00] <mamonassassina> gyaresu: that is not an answer,that is the reason why i came to the channel to ask for help
[04:00] <mamonassassina> gyaresu: no,i didn't find the solution yet
[04:00] <hassan> quit
[04:00] <gyaresu> mamonassassina, So you've read the blender manual? 'man blender'
[04:01] <fblade> how can i write to a removable ntfs disk?
[04:01] <gyaresu> hassan, no
[04:01] <gyaresu> !ntfs-3g > fblade
[04:01] <thegve> fblade: Have you enabled NTFS write support in the kernel?
[04:01] <priich> mamonassassina, try pressing alt+downarrow
[04:02] <fblade> thegve| how do i do that
[04:02] <gyaresu> thegve, You DONT want to put it in the kernel.
[04:02] <mamonassassina> gyaresu: i'm there now
[04:02] <mamonassassina> priich: no effect.
[04:02] <predator> hi

[04:02] <predator> how can i get in system menu in ubuntu?
[04:02] <gyaresu> fblade, you can just /msg ubotu

[04:04] <mamonassassina> priich: no
[04:04] <priich> mamonassassina, if that doesn't help then may i suggest you ask the question in #blender  They should be able to give you a better answer.
[04:05] <thegve> How can I make sure that normal users can mount samba mounts? I'm writing a login script and I don't plan to run anything as root in there...
[04:05] <thegve> I know the fstab way
[04:05] <thegve> I mean using the mount command as a normal user
[04:05] <mamonassassina> priich: yes,probably,but as I thought the solution was in the shortcut,I came here.i'll ask the question there,thank you very much.
[04:05] <thegve> And i tried giving it the SUID bit
[04:05] <M0E^lnx> hey, is there a way to boot the 6.10 cd into CLI without the graphics and all?
=== VisualStation is now known as VisualSt|SGBD
[04:05] <gyaresu> thegve, smb.conf there is a specific example and section in that file

[04:11] <gyaresu> M0E^lnx, Can't change the default card in BIOS. Should be able to.
[04:11] <Plzr> floating: it should work
[04:11] <boink> you can't downgrade from 64 bit to 32 bit
[04:11] <Tim90> its a pc
[04:11] <boink> you need to do a new install
[04:11] <gyaresu> Tim90, and pointless really.
[04:11] <boink> 32 bit works fine on a 64 bit box
[04:11] <thegve> dooglus: I was just reading the smb.conf, and couldn't find anything about it in there. I'll checkout fusesmb
[04:11] <M0E^lnx> gyaresu: well, I run Vector Linux on the other drive, and it picks it up right... the default in BIOS is the NVIDIA card...
[04:12] <patrick_king> there isnt anything about RealPlayer on edgy
[04:12] <M0E^lnx> but that one goes blank..
[04:12] <Tim90> gyaresu i agree , just fel like makng use of it ,feels like a waste
[04:12] <boink> I was wondering that too .. using realplay on edgy
[04:12] <dooglus> thegve: fusesmb is a filesystem in user space (ie. not in the kernel).  it's quite separate from samba and smbfs
[04:12] <gyaresu> Tim90, only cause app support isn't there.
[04:12] <M0E^lnx> gyaresu: and if I switch the monitor to the intel chip, all I see is lines all across
[04:12] <boink> Tim90: you could try another linux distro, if you feel ubuntu doesn't do enuf
[04:12] <gyaresu> M0E^lnx, res problem.
[04:12] <Tim90> real player works on edgy
[04:12] <boink> it just depends on what you want to do
[04:13] <boink> sure, but from which repo?
[04:13] <M0E^lnx> yes, so how do I go from there back to the CLI?
[04:13] <boink> I couldn't find the right repo to apt-get realplay
[04:13] <Tim90> I like the icons in Kubuntu but soom got annoying
[04:13] <boink> I installed xubuntu on an old sony laptop
[04:13] <patrick_king> Tim90 how did you install it
[04:13] <gyaresu> M0E^lnx, This is for an install right?
[04:13] <Plzr> why is every version of the Linksys WPC54G listed at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported exept for v3.x
[04:13] <Tim90> live cd
[04:13] <patrick_king> i mean RealPlayer
[04:14] <Tim90> another thing is i got some on called pov to set up, my partions right, and do my network stuff, remotly controlling my pc
[04:14] <thegve> dooglus: This is where I am hacking on... http://pastebin.com/819739
[04:15] <thegve> It wil need to be a bit prettier...
[04:16] <Tim90> i will go and burn edgy 6.10, then install it.
[04:16] <Tim90> its a shame i almost had this set up the way i wanted it
[04:17] <M0E^lnx> gyaresu: yes, this is for an install
[04:17] <Tim90> i will be back after i have burnt the 6.10 32 bit, see you guys later
[04:18] <predator> is there any utility for mount and umount hdd?
[04:18] <thegve> dooglus: It is meant as a Linux variant on the kixtart scripts
[04:18] <slavik> predator: you just named them ...

[04:20] <brrrt> is one 8GB swap partition OK for a amd64 server with 4GB of RAM ?
[04:20] <hassan> salut
[04:20] <gharz> guys...  checked google and it looks like ubuntu doesn't support webcam?
[04:20] <slavik> 8GB is a lot ... especially with 4GB ram
[04:20] <hassan> Merou where r u
[04:21] <dooglus> thegve: PHP?  yuck!
[04:21] <knoppix> hda: write_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, CHS=115/10/51, sector=116600
[04:21] <knoppix> what's wrong this my hda?
[04:21] <Lachkater> 8GB swap ?
[04:21] <brrrt> slavik: do you think i should take less?
[04:21] <slavik> brrrt: on my home system with 1Gb of RAM, it made a 3GB swap and it almost never gets used
[04:21] <Lachkater> a bit too much i think everything above 2B would be ok ;)
[04:21] <thegve> dooglus: What's "objective" wrong with PHP?
[04:21] <lupine_85> I have 1.5GB RAM and /never/ use swap
[04:21] <slavik> brrrt: 2GB swap should be plenty for you
[04:21] <brrrt> sure but it is a server
[04:21] <brrrt> ok
[04:21] <slavik> oh, if it's a server then yeah. 8GB is reasonable
=== knoppix is now known as glenn_quagmire
[04:22] <brrrt> i expect hight traffic...
[04:22] <dooglus> brrrt: I've never filled up my 1GB of swap except for when something has crashed, and then I was glad I only had 1GB for it to fill before the system came back to life...
[04:22] <lupine_85> my server has 128MB RAM and 1GB swap
[04:22] <lupine_85> it's hosting a beryl mirror, and hasn't had any problems so far :p
[04:22] <sivik> what file would i need to add a line to in order to run a script when i load x

[04:22] <slavik> in your home dir
[04:22] <lupine_85> oh, lead x... yeah :)
[04:23] <brrrt> if its just a waste of hd-space i would take 8GB, but it is making any problems i would not
[04:23] <sivik> lupine_85: so does it need to be rc.local or .xession?
[04:23] <lupine_85> .xsession
[04:23] <lupine_85> sorry
[04:23] <slavik> sivik: does this script have a GUI?
[04:23] <dooglus> sivik: ~/.xprofile
[04:23] <thegve> dooglus: "OK" (whatever)

[04:24] <mike1o> i get this error when upgrading from dapper to edgy http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30639/
[04:24] <slavik> sivik: Ctrl+Alt+L much?
[04:24] <sivik> slavik: i use ctrl-l cause my lock screen seems to not work correctly in e17
[04:24] <slavik> check System -> Pref -> Keyboard shortcuts
[04:25] <sivik> slavik: i'm not running gnome nor kde
[04:25] <slavik> sivik: fair enough
[04:25] <M0E^lnx> so does any one know of any parameters maybe I can use at the boot prompt to avoid all the graphic stuff?
[04:25] <Pelo> morphish,  it happens, have you tested your connection with a test site ?

[04:26] <kupesoft> when is new debian come?
[04:26] <mogydy> has anybody tried cario-dock?
[04:26] <dooglus> slavik: because if you type ~ in that grep command, it'll be replaced by your home directory's path, and it won't be found in the Xsession file
[04:26] <Pelo> morphish, try this site to test your connection,  just in case this is not a ubuntu problem and only a site one  http://www.abeltronica.com/PagRec/uk/01/

[04:28] <mogydy> but it is hell
[04:28] <netpython> mike1o, k
[04:28] <mogydy> u have to add modules to ur kernel\
[04:28] <mogydy> that kind of shit
[04:29] <Balachmar> slavik: No I'm on Edgy why?
[04:29] <selinuxium> mogydy: Language! :)

[04:29] <mogydy> when u plug ur camera and do lsusb
[04:29] <Pelo> dfgas_,  you'd have to save your prefs somewhere and you can'T do that easily on livecd,  look it up in the forum  I know there is a way to do it where you save your prefs on a usbdrive or some such

[04:31] <dfgas_> Pelo, nm you don't understand
[04:31] <morphyc2> I disabled ipv6 in Edgy 6.10 but I still get slow responses
[04:31] <mike1o> netpython, so far so good
[04:31] <sivik> morphyc2: slow response to the net or something else?
[04:32] <morphyc2> sivik: slow response to execute any application even to start nautilus
[04:32] <sivik> morphyc2: thats probably not caused by ipv6, how much ram and how big is your swap
[04:34] <morphyc2> sivik: I have 735 RAM and 512 swap, this problem happen if only I connected to another network with the old dns server and domain configuration untill I modify those info it works fine
[04:34] <Feonix762> Wooooott.. finally got airodump and aireplay to work for the first time in my life :)
[04:34] <sivik> morphyc2: first off, its not good to run less than 2x ram for the swap, and second, thats weird cause a dns server shouldn't cause your computer to run slow
[04:35] <Feonix762> Was always limited by my hardware so I finally sprung for a nice wireless card.. lovin it
[04:35] <slavik> Balachmar: I dunno what to say, check launchpad for the bug ...

[04:36] <morphyc2> sivik: I know but I was working on Ubuntu Dapper LTS with the current conf and I didn't face this problem, and I'm sure about that it is related to dns and domain
[04:36] <Feonix762> savje.. use gcc
[04:36] <zsh> !gcc
[04:36] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)

[04:56] <M0E^lnx> I don't get any video on any of my vid adapters
[04:56] <andax> M0E^lnx, you have to take 2 steps. 1) in the grub menu use the edit function. Delete the word "splash" or add "nosplash". then you will see the boot process. then kde/gnome loads up, press ctrl+alt+f1 and you get the console
[04:57] <aktiwers> It seams kind of empty on #java ? Anyone knows another place I can get help with Java programming?

[04:58] <mailer> where to discuss ubuntu printing?

[04:58] <M0E^lnx> so it should look like nosplash vga=771?
[04:58] <brum> M0E: yes, i was under the impression it was already installed
[04:58] <andax> M0E^lnx, just add vga=771 to the end
[04:58] <M0E^lnx> ok...
[04:58] <netpython> aktiwers, yes all developers there mostly you might have a chance at ubuntu-devel
[04:58] <M0E^lnx> thanks all

[05:03] <savje> m4cgyv3ry: no
[05:03] <Lachkater> savje: just enter ./configure thats all
[05:03] <wastrel> savje:  in the source directory there might be a script called "configure"
[05:03] <wastrel> ./configure  will run that to generate a makefile  then you can use  make

[05:06] <[h] tony|afk> moinmoin
[05:06] <wastrel> savje:  configure is a script, you run it from the command line.    ./configure   at the command line will run the configure script which is located in your current directory (the source directory)

[05:18] <mrobbert> I recently lost a bunch of icons from my notification area, they're for many of the KDE apps that I run (amarok, akregator, kdewallet). I am running the Gnome desktop. Is there something I need to start up to get them back?
[05:18] <savje> wastrel: thanks for the help, but I can't get it to work :( the configure.in file seems to be configureded, some other idea?
[05:19] <dreamer> ok: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30644/
[05:19] <zhaohui> is this command in the root user?
[05:19] <wastrel> savje: dunno, i've never really played with autoconf myself  - ask in a developer type channel i guess :] 
[05:19] <wastrel> or roll your own makefile
[05:20] <savje> wastrel: don't know what or how rolling make files are, but somehow I wish I could...
[05:21] <wastrel> savje:  "roll your own" is an idiom for "create your own"  (reference is to cigarettes)   you'd have to look up makefile syntax... probably easier to get your autoconf working, but i don't know how to do that  :]

[05:28] <wastrel> not sure what ming is but  apt-cache search ming | grep php  gives  php5-uuid

[05:30] <Pelo> Salah,   there is a way to do it over the net but it is very very slow and I haven'T found it reliable

[05:30] <Pelo> Salah,  you can look at  ubuntu.com for instructions

[05:31] <netpython> huntedgod, and if that doesn't work right away chmod +x first
[05:31] <Pelo> m4cgyv3ry,  then I don'T know what to tell you , try searching the net for a source code file and install it manualy http://www.linuxsoft.cz/en/ http://www.linux.org/
[05:31] <m4cgyv3ry> i just wanted the ming working on php5
[05:31] <wastrel> you don't need +x if you're using sh to call the script

[05:33] <UbuntuNewbie> have a link Lachkater?

[05:34] <jvolkman> I used Slackware, Debian and Gentoo for 8 years before switching to Ubuntu
[05:34] <wastrel> it releases more regularly than debian
[05:34] <iter> or .. you might say it's a cleaned up debian
[05:34] <PecisDarbs> hi crowd, does 6.06.1 release contains xen enabled kernel images?
[05:34] <huntedgod> oh another question, how do i give "execute permission to the "current user" ?
[05:34] <iter> with a REAL INSTALLER
[05:34] <PecisDarbs> or it is just Edgy priviledge?
[05:34] <Arepie> what mp3 player is the best? Listen <-- i have problem with that.. always hang..
[05:34] <straterra> Installer?
[05:34] <Pelo> straterra,  some of us need it to be dumb down,  we're still recovering from win9x

[05:40] <Ash-Fox> Kim^J, well Java doesn't really have it's own DE :P Besides that, I'm just curious with the GPL licensing.
[05:41] <h3sp4wn> tapeworm: There is but I wouldn't recommend it as the cleanest way to do it
[05:41] <Kim^J> Ash-Fox: Didn't you talk about Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu?

[05:44] <h3sp4wn> tapeworm: You can just add a line to it in fstab (man fstab) you don't have to use UUID= you can use LABEL= (presuming you use edgy)
[05:44] <Kim^J> straterra: Yep.
[05:44] <Kim^J> Just the preinstalled that differs.
[05:45] <mrobbert> Pelo: I have it on my menu, and it is in the process table, but nothing in the GUI

[05:46] <Pelo> mrobbert,  is it possible that you just donT' have a notification area in your task bar anymore ?

[05:47] <n0dl|laptop> does anyone know of any foreign apt servers
[05:47] <markl_> whoever changed the default sounds for Gaim in Edge is a beautiful genius
[05:47] <mrobbert> Pelo: I killed all procs that had the word amarok and restarted and still nothing.
[05:47] <Kim^J> dreamer: Hm... Make a logical and then have a swap there?
[05:47] <markl_> s/Edge/Edgy/
[05:47] <Pelo> mrobbert,  is it possible that you just donT' have a notification area in your task bar anymore ?
[05:48] <mrobbert> Pelo: I also  removed my notification area and added it back in, still nothing
[05:48] <h3sp4wn> n0dl|laptop: countrycode.archive.ubuntu.com (i.e gb.archive.ubuntu.com de.archive.ubuntu.com etc)
[05:48] <timo90> Hey how do you save a file in the terminal , i done sudo nano /usr/bin/startxgl.sh and pasted some stuff , i need to save them now
[05:48] <Pelo> mrobbert, ,  reinstall amorak
[05:48] <n0dl|laptop> h3sp4wn: thanks
[05:48] <dreamer> Kim^J: you mean: make extended with 2 logical: 1 OS and 1 swap
[05:48] <Kim^J> timo90: ctrl+o
[05:48] <mrobbert> Pelo: What is this, Windows?
[05:48] <dreamer> just no idea how to do that :S
[05:48] <Kim^J> dreamer: Yeah.
[05:48] <Kim^J> dreamer: gparted, qtparted
[05:49] <dreamer> or make the ubuntu-partition into an extended :S
[05:49] <Pelo> mrobbert, use synaptic , just select reinstall package,   I didn'T say uninstall it
[05:49] <h3sp4wn> n0dl|laptop: use - host gb.archive.ubuntu.com (to check whether it exists first)
[05:49] <Kim^J> dreamer: There can only be four logical/primary partions. But there can be many moore extended partions inside the logical partions.
[05:50] <timo90> Kim^J: thanks that worked
[05:50] <Kim^J> timo90: =)
[05:50] <dreamer> Kim^J: I can't make an extended
[05:51] <Kim^J> dreamer: Huh?
[05:51] <Kim^J> You have to make one logical and give all remaining space to that. Then you create extended ones inside that one.
[05:51] <dreamer> I can't do anything to /dev/hda2 aka the ubuntu-partition
[05:51] <dreamer> Kim^J: I have remove ubuntu and the unallocated
[05:51] <dreamer> +to
[05:51] <Kim^J> dreamer: Are you in Ubuntu right now?
[05:52] <Kim^J> Are you in WIndows?
[05:52] <dreamer> this is my server
[05:52] <dreamer> thu desktop is in ubuntu right now
[05:52] <Kim^J> oh ok.
[05:52] <JuJuBee> I am building a server for my classroom.  We have about 8 computers.  I am considering doing a netboot sometime in the near future.  What hardware should I include? (Mobo, processor, ram, HD space)?
[05:52] <Kim^J> maybe you should download gparted and then work from there?
[05:52] <Kim^J> JuJuBee: At least 16 dualcores.
[05:53] <mrobbert> Pelo: No help with the reinstall.
[05:53] <dreamer> I _have_ gparted, I allready said that :P
[05:53] <Kim^J> and 64GB ram.
[05:53] <Kim^J> dreamer: No no. The LIVE CD.
[05:53] <dreamer> aah, ok ..
[05:53] <dreamer> hmm, I have knoppix somewhere ..
[05:53] <incorrect> what do i need to install to get totem to play dvds ?
[05:53] <Kim^J> No no. The Gparted Live CD.
[05:54] <dreamer> beh .. hmm
[05:54] <Kim^J> incorrect: gstreamer-1.0-plugins-ugly or something like that.
[05:54] <Kim^J> incorrect: More a KDE guuy
[05:54] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: You want to run everything on the server with the linux terminal server project ?
[05:54] <netpython> !codecs | incorrect
[05:54] <ubotu> incorrect: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[05:54] <miffe_> dreamer: the ubuntu live cd also has gparted
[05:54] <JuJuBee> h3sp4wn : I am considering it, yes.
[05:54] <dreamer> hmm, the new install[cd has live-function ..
[05:54] <mrobbert> Pelo: I tried running from the command line and I get - X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168
[05:54] <incorrect> ty
[05:55] <dreamer> but, I have a cd-rw somewhere . I'll put gparted on that
[05:55] <mrobbert> Pelo: I get that twice and then nothing. Same error when I run akregator
[05:55] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: For just basic applications (openoffice etc ?)
[05:56] <JuJuBee> Yes.  Possibly a wine app or 2
[05:56] <lando>                                                                                                m
[05:57] <miffe_> anyone know why wakeonlan doens't work on edgy?
[05:57] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: Ram is more important than processor power - and you need fast disks
[05:57] <mumrah> i just upgraded to 6.10, and i can no longer read or write cds
[05:58] <mumrah> any ideas?
[05:59] <JuJuBee> h3sp4wn : how fast?
[05:59] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: 4gb ram (with space for more)  , 15000 scsi disks , a dual core opteron (with a socket for another) should easily handle 20 clients - You want to run X locally (not using nfs root) running it from a ram disk
[05:59] <DanglyBits> anyone have a broadcom 4306 wireless running on edgy?
[06:00] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: Don't consider anything other than scsi
[06:00] <JuJuBee> OK.
[06:00] <mrobbert> Pelo: I just found the error in ubuntu forums and they suggest commenting out wacom devices in xorg.conf. I'm going to try that. Thanks for you help so far.
[06:00] <JuJuBee> Thanks.
[06:00] <sancho___> i'm receiving 'BADSIG 40976EAF437D05B5 Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key <ftpmaster@ubuntu.com>' errors upon apt-get update now on my edgy upgrade box; have already set my apt sources to just archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com per suggestion; any ideas? http://pastebin.com/819797
[06:00] <h3sp4wn> JuJuBee: Sun's opteron servers are very well made and reasonably priced
[06:01] <JuJuBee> I will take a look...
[06:01] <incorrect> i take it version 6.10 was not the best thing to install?
[06:01] <boink> depends
[06:01] <boink> 6.10 is the latest, sure
[06:01] <boink> but dapper is a LTS release
[06:01] <alexander> hey all
[06:02] <incorrect> seems like 6.10 is missing some packages
[06:02] <boink> like what?
[06:02] <h3sp4wn> incorrect: user-mode-linux by any chance (I noticed that) :/
[06:02] <boink> it depends on how your /etc/apt/sources.list is set up
[06:02] <incorrect> the gstreamer ugly plugins
[06:02] <LimonJalisciense> i upgraded 6.10 and im having problems with my networkl
[06:02] <netpython> !universe
[06:02] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[06:03] <alexander> i got a question: is there a way to bond 2 NIC in ubuntu?
[06:03] <boink> which gstreamer plugin?
[06:03] <boink> when I do an apt-cache search, I get a lot
[06:03] <incorrect> boink: ugly
[06:03] <h3sp4wn> alexander: You can use the bonding modules which are in the kernel anyway
[06:03] <boink> gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly - GStreamer plugins from the "ugly" set
[06:03] <miffe_> incorrect: gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly is in universe
[06:03] <boink> I got that one
[06:04] <h3sp4wn> alexander: switch needs to support vlan trunking for some modes
[06:04] <boink> again, it depends on how your /etc/apt/sources.list is set up
[06:04] <incorrect> i thought i had enabled universe
[06:04] <incorrect> i just thought i had to uncomment them
[06:04] <boink> check again .. then update the list and do an apt-cache search
[06:04] <hussam> anyone here good with iptables?
[06:04] <alexander> h3sp4wn, i am kinda new to all of this, you know a place were i can read up on this?
[06:05] <Tjoels> hey, when i use the nv driver, i can get a resolution of 1280x1024 @ 75 Hz, but when i use the nvidia driver it can only use 800x600 @ 50 Hz
[06:05] <h3sp4wn> alexander: linux/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt (in the kernel source or the kernel documentation package)
[06:06] <incorrect> deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe <-  i've uncommented that
[06:06] <sivik> Tjoels: that probably means your stuff isn't installed correctly
[06:06] <sivik> Tjoels: have you installing the linux-restricted
[06:06] <boink> did you do an apt-get update?
[06:06] <netpython> incorrect, example /etc/sources.list http://pastebin.com/819804
[06:06] <sivik> sudo apt-get upgrade
[06:06] <hussam> for example, what do I do if I need to add a rule for a interface where the ip is dynamic. do I have to change the rules every time the IP changes?
[06:06] <h3sp4wn> alexander: maybe that is a bit complicated (and has some things that are not relevant to you)
[06:06] <incorrect> sorry
[06:06] <Tjoels> sivik: yeah
[06:06] <sivik> wrong windows
[06:06] <Lattyware> Hey all, Could anyone help me with the sudden loss of my second monitor (via twinview) and the inability to play video via xv.
[06:07] <sivik> Tjoels: did you restart x
[06:07] <Tjoels> sivik: well, i'm using the 9xxx nvidia driver
[06:07] <boink> whenever you update your sources.list, you need to do an apt-get update
[06:07] <Tjoels> sikik: yeah
[06:07] <Lattyware> Is there somthing up with the official nvidia driver?
[06:07] <sivik> Tjoels: so
[06:07] <sivik> Tjoels: not sure
[06:07] <sivik> Lattyware: multiverse repo
[06:07] <sivik> !nvidia
[06:07] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:07] <incorrect> netpython: mine looks like that now
[06:07] <alexander> h3sp4wn, ty, i am taking a look at it right now.
[06:07] <screechingcat> Lattyware: there;s a new one out
[06:07] <netpython> incorrect, good :-)
[06:07] <Tjoels> sikik: i am trying to install beryl, so using the new driver
[06:07] <Lattyware> sivik: That wasn't what I was asking.
[06:07] <sivik> Tjoels: not sure with beryl
[06:07] <m4cgyv3ry> what is php5-uuid ?
[06:08] <sivik> Lattyware: what was your question
[06:08] <incorrect> saying that all that was different was the url's
[06:08] <screechingcat> Lattyware: everyones raving about some new feature.

[06:09] <screechingcat> Lattyware: im sorry. i dont know much about it. i dont have an nvidia and thefore dont care
[06:09] <miffe_> Zaggynl: ps aux

[06:10] <h3sp4wn> Zaggynl: services on a specific port ?
[06:10] <Zaggynl> nah
[06:10] <screechingcat> Lattyware: just seach in digg.com though. im pretty sure it was fronte-paged

[06:12] <simon__> Hi
[06:12] <deadlyallance077> does anybody hear know much about genome-dock ?
[06:12] <h3sp4wn> !info fluxbox edgy
[06:12] <ubotu> fluxbox: Highly configurable and low resource X11 Window manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.15.1+1.0rc2-1 (edgy), package size 899 kB, installed size 2888 kB
[06:12] <Crankymonky> Thanks
[06:12] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: whats genome-dock ?
[06:12] <deadlyallance077> sorry gnome-dock
[06:12] <deadlyallance077> its a mac osx like dock for gnome
=== aoupi_ is now known as aoupi
[06:13] <rrodri> jjjjjj
[06:13] <h3sp4wn> Zaggynl: So you need to know what services you have running with ports which could be acting as a proxy ?
[06:13] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: i use kicker for my dock
[06:13] <rrodri> ellow
[06:13] <deadlyallance077> kicker ?
[06:13] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: its KDE. but it works brilliantly
[06:13] <Zaggynl> h3sp4wn, exactly
[06:13] <h3sp4wn> deadlyallance077: engage is a similar dock
[06:13] <raghu206> is there a editor which opens faster than gedit ?
[06:13] <Zaggynl> I shut down Tor, but gamesurge still glines me
=== BenC__ is now known as BenC
[06:13] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: kicker is the kde equivalent of gnome-panel
[06:13] <deadlyallance077> do they do the bouncy thing and auto hide ?
[06:13] <dreamer> Kim^J: gparted won't make /dev/hda2 into extended
[06:14] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: no bounce but autohide yes
[06:14] <miffe_> dreamer: then you probably have to delete it and create a new extended partition
[06:14] <h3sp4wn> Zaggynl: sudo netstat -lpAinet
[06:14] <deadlyallance077> see gnome dock is omost exactly like the osx dock
[06:15] <Zaggynl> h3sp4wn, thanks
[06:15] <screechingcat> !gnome-dock
[06:15] <ubotu> gnome-dock is a MacOS X -like dock for the gnome desktop, see www.gnome-dock.org
[06:15] <Intangir> does anyone know of a text based gnutella client?
[06:15] <dreamer> miffe_: aka reinstall ubuntu :/
[06:15] <DanglyBits> anyone with broadcom 4306 wireless experience
[06:15] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: ^^^^^
[06:15] <deadlyallance077> i am in love with the osx gui and all i have to compleat it in ubuntu is the dock
[06:15] <h3sp4wn> Intangir: I have used gnut before but I am not sure whether it is still mainted
[06:15] <h3sp4wn> deadlyallance077: If you want os x why not just buy a mac ?
[06:16] <miffe_> dreamer: you could tar it all up, recreate the partition and unpack the tar again
[06:16] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: gnome-dock is a MacOS X -like dock for the gnome desktop, see www.gnome-dock.org
[06:16] <deadlyallance077> because i am running a mini itx box
[06:16] <dreamer> miffe_: hahah .. hmm

[06:16] <h3sp4wn> buy a mac mini - problem solved
[06:17] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: they're pretty cheap these days
[06:17] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: and they intoduced intel core2cuo today
[06:17] <deadlyallance077> there not as small of footprint as my mini itx and dont work well in a car and i need linux for my pftp
[06:17] <h3sp4wn> Almost anything you can run on linux you can run on mac os x
[06:18] <mailer> Hi, will report this to -devel and -bugs channels ... cannot see bug files with launchpad --- evince 0.6.1 shipped with edgy wont print in landscape
[06:18] <sudo|fader> anybody know were lynx by default downloads files to?
[06:18] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: you can always install linux on a mac machine
[06:18] <miffe_> sudo|fader: to the current directory
[06:18] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: i tri-lboot ubuntu and os x and windows on my macbook pro
[06:18] <deadlyallance077> but it still wont work well in my car! its for a car pc
[06:18] <sudo|fader> miffe_ meaning from the dir from were lynx was startet?
[06:19] <miffe_> sudo|fader: yeah
[06:19] <screechingcat> deadlyallance077: gnome-dock.org
[06:19] <sudo|fader> it dosent!
[06:19] <deadlyallance077> built in to a breefcase with a wireless card and a 3 watt cell booster so that i can get the net in the oil field
[06:20] <deadlyallance077> it plugs in to a 7" touchscreen in myt dash
[06:20] <deadlyallance077> or the 21" widescreen in the top oof the case
[06:21] <raghu206> can we install gnome-dock with out installing XGL
[06:21] <deadlyallance077> yes i think so but i am not sure
[06:21] <deadlyallance077> i am haveinhg some troubles getting it started
[06:21] <miffe_> sudo|fader: it does for me, by default. but you can chage it after the download is completed

[06:23] <PetriP-TNT> i want to usemy ipod fully with rhythmbox
[06:24] <gpfmag> ddfdfjkkk
[06:24] <mailer> evince irc channel lets us  know the issue (possibly others) fixed in source and there was talk of a new release soon
[06:24] <screechingcat> PetriP-TNT: get rid of rhythmbox. amarok is way better
[06:24] <PetriP-TNT> nah
[06:25] <miffe_> PetriP-TNT: you'll need gstreamer-ffmpeg for mp4 and one of the wmas, and gstreamer-pitfdll + w32codecs for the other wma
[06:25] <screechingcat> PetriP-TNT: when u dont have a codec, amarok pops up a dailog telling you the required codec and will open synatpic to install it for you
[06:25] <PetriP-TNT> i got ffmpeg installed, didnt work
[06:26] <deadlyallance077> petri-tnt i am going to get kicked for this but look into automatix
[06:26] <PetriP-TNT> :>
[06:27] <davvs> how can i run 2 x severs? 1 on the TV with only a gamepad as input and 1 on the computer-monitor using keyboard and mouse as input?
[06:27] <PetriP-TNT> and other thing, why wont mozilla-vlc work?
[06:27] <otacon22_> Anyone know a packet to make a ubuntu pc to a firewall dedicated pc, with a http interface simle for configure?
[06:27] <seth__> davvs, you can run two servers, one on each device
[06:27] <davvs> how do i do it seth__ ?
[06:27] <miffe_> anyone know why wake-on-lan doens't work on edgy?

[06:28] <seth__> davvs, you define separate Screen sections in xorg.conf.  If's very similar to what you do for dual monitors.  I had my dual monitors set up as two separate servers, and then I merged them into one.  Let me see if I still have the config that made them separate

[06:39] <snoops> Hi, I'm going to format my dual booting hdd, reinstall windows, then install edgy (currently using dapper).. Is there anything I need to backup other than my home directory? I've got a mysql db, so I guess I need to dump that
[06:40] <seth__> snoops, why not just upgrade, and preserve your data in the norma way?
[06:40] <mnepton> snoops: MySQL stuff is in /var/lib/mysql
[06:40] <mrmist> Hi all
[06:41] <shwag> ok...what is the problem.  sudo: unable to lookup dev via gethostbyname()
[06:41] <mrmist> Any way to make only minimized windows appear in the "window-list" panel in ubuntu ??
[06:41] <snoops> well, I heard there were quite a few problems - regarding people using nvidia, xgl, compiz then upgrading to edgy.. A clean install feels better to me anyway, since the new nvidia driver implements aiglx, so I can use that with beryl
[06:41] <prestosd> does anyone know how to export theme files?
[06:42] <snoops> plus, my windows install has a virus, and when putting the xp cd in to reinstall, it can't recognise the partitions properly on that hdd
[06:42] <snoops> thanks mnepton
[06:42] <prestosd> does anyone know if its possible to EXPORT theme files???
[06:42] <seth__> snoops, when I do something like that, I rename all my directories, and reinstall but don't recreate the file systems.  then I have _all_ my data.  after a few weeks, when I know I've copied everything I might need, then I erase the old stuff.
[06:43] <salome> 1. what kind of theme files 2, export them to what
[06:43] <prestosd> all kinds
[06:43] <prestosd> export them to tar/gz
[06:43] <salome> you realize there are thousands of kinds
[06:43] <prestosd> no no no
[06:43] <seth__> prestosd, that's not exporting.  that's just copying
[06:43] <prestosd> I want to export the ones I have right now, so I can import them into my other partition of ubuntu
[06:43] <salome> tar -zcvf theme.tar.gz themedir/
[06:43] <snoops> good idea seth__, not enough space for me to do that sadly
[06:43] <seth__> you can copy anything you like, of course.
[06:44] <Crankymonky> prestosd, The application, window border, control themes of gnome are already in .tar.gz, usually
[06:44] <prestosd> not after you drag and drop though
[06:44] <seth__> snoops, then you might want to do it selectively.  I just hate the idea of assuming that there it no data hiding somewhere that I might need
[06:44] <salome> drag and drop
[06:44] <salome> what?  from where to where?
[06:44] <salome> what kind of themes?
[06:44] <seth__> snoops, too easy to make a mistake.  of course, it depends whether you really can't afford to lose things, or if it would just be inconvenient.
[06:44] <prestosd> WAIT
[06:45] <prestosd> you drag the tar.gz files into the themes window
[06:45] <prestosd> then click install

[07:25] <predaeus> grant: maybe you need to install alacarte. that is the menu editor for gnome.
[07:25] <phaedrus44> Kyynara:   ne time
[07:25] <jimmypw> <scout> not even a router?
[07:25] <predaeus> grant: sudo apt-get install alacarte
[07:25] <timo90> POV are you here
[07:25] <scout> jimmypw, well yes a router... or more like a switch
[07:25] <timo90> Is POVaddct here
[07:25] <scout> jimmypw, i think it's called
[07:25] <grant> predaeus, i know i already have this program, i've used it before, but it doesn't seem to be running now
[07:26] <predaeus> grant: hm, still gconf-editor should run from console too
[07:26] <jimmypw> <sout> is there a web front for it or an additional onfiguration program
[07:26] <chopchop_> guys, is ubuntu system v unix??
[07:26] <grant> predaeus, nope nothing
[07:26] <mentok> this may be a strange question, but does anyone know of where I can find some info about the benifits of ubuntu over debian? thanks :)
[07:26] <scout> jimmypw, i think there is a webfront
[07:26] <ladydoor> !debian
[07:26] <ubotu> Debian is "the rock upon which Ubuntu is founded". To see more details on the relationship, see: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship
[07:26] <Agrajag_> chopchop_: no, it's linux
[07:26] <ladydoor> mentok: ^^^
[07:26] <mentok> ladydoor: hmm?
[07:27] <DanglyBits> anyone with broadcom 4306 wireless experience?
[07:27] <Agrajag_> chopchop_: which is kind of similar but it's not sysv
[07:27] <predaeus> grant: I dont know if gnome would run withouth gconf-editor. maybe try installing it. sudo apt-get install gconf-editor
[07:27] <ladydoor> mentok: see ubotu's last post.
[07:27] <mentok> ladydoor: oh! I see :)
[07:27] <ladydoor> :-)
[07:27] <mentok> ladydoor: thanks
[07:27] <chopchop_> Agrajag_: thanks
[07:27] <ladydoor> mentok: np
[07:27] <grant> predaeus, it is listed under my commands, it just wont run, its really weird
[07:27] <mentok> ladydoor: :)
[07:27] <jimmypw> <sout> 1 more thing, are you trying to aess the server form a computer on the same network (plugged in to the same swith)?
[07:27] <grant> predaeus, i've even tried it with sudo
[07:27] <predaeus> grant: somehow sounds familiar. are you uptodate?
[07:27] <scout> jimmypw, nope

[07:28] <scout> jimmypw, well to begin with... i can't access my own ftp server from my own computer
[07:28] <grant> predaeus, anyways, thanks for you help, i had better go get ready, i'll sort it out later

[07:29] <anan> hi everyone, does anyone know how to "lock" the toolbars, status bar, background etc... for an unprivileged account in Ubuntu ? i dont want the user to modify it
[07:30] <sancho___> kinda not finding much help out on the web for it...
[07:30] <socomm> I'm using the ubuntu live-cd. Trying to recover files from a computer.
[07:30] <j0nas`> hey guys, does anyone know of an apt package for gcc 4.1 or greater?
[07:30] <Justy-> Hi
[07:30] <j0nas`> OR--know how to make one?
[07:31] <socomm> I'm curious if it's at all possible to compress a file onto a samba share, because I don't have enough space on my ram to compress it locally.
[07:31] <scout> jimmypw, how do i find the ip of my router ?
[07:31] <j0nas`> it doesnt work like that...
[07:31] <socomm> Any thoughts?
[07:31] <j0nas`> have you tried compressing it on your local machine?
[07:31] <zerosmoke> it should be in the documentation
[07:31] <zerosmoke> scoiut
[07:31] <j0nas`> you shouldnt be able to run out of ram on any modern os because they do memory swapping
[07:31] <Justy-> scout, "ifconfig" and that will give you a thought
[07:32] <j0nas`> scout: you may have to go to your router's status screen for that info
[07:32] <socres> can anyone tell me how to configure xchatosd?
[07:32] <phaedrus44> 192.168.1.1

[07:33] <phaedrus44> yeah that too

[07:38] <scout> phaedrus44, nope no luck
[07:38] <j0nas`> antiPo5ix: edit inittab and set runlevel to 3 instead of 5 (or 6?)
[07:38] <antiPo5ix> j0nas` where do I find the inittab
[07:39] <jimmypw> <sout> Im back with a few questions Please can you pastebin the response of ifconfig?

[07:49] <ladydoor> kmaynard: i've never liked that phase (so i guess it applies to language as well)...but yeah, definitely.
[07:49] <Fastly> and how do i stop this?
[07:49] <Mantice> I still got the Warning Azureus did not shutdown tidily.

[07:54] <niktaris> hi, is there an known problem with beagle and edgy ? I get an error while installing beagle-backend-evolution
[07:54] <seth__> abhinay, it has some instabilities.  you'll have better results with the text mode install on the alternate cd
[07:54] <abhinay> Is there anyway to improve the performance of Live CD ?
[07:54] <variant> SupremacyGnu: yes, apt-get install alsa-oss and then start your programs with aoss programname
[07:54] <j0nas`> khoda: pack your computer up in the box and send it back!
[07:54] <kmaynard> abhinay, install it on your pc
[07:54] <j0nas`> just kidding man, i have no idea
[07:54] <abhinay> because of low bandwidth it takes 2 days to download a CD image
[07:54] <seth__> abhinay, buy a faster cd drive?  buy a faster computer?  anything specific?
[07:54] <khoda> j0nas`: it's not an issue with the computer. i saw on the forums someone else had the same problem

[07:54] <shingalated> I'm trying to enable the repositories to download and install software and when I reload the package list with 'apt-get update' or in synaptic, I am unable to download any of the gpg keys because my router is using port 8080 for remote management and it cant be disabled

[07:54] <variant> abhinay: you can create your own from your running system with linux-live.org scripts, the live cd's those scripts produce are about 5X faster
[07:54] <kmaynard> abhinay, or use the alternate cd...the live cd is too sluggish for my taste
[07:55] <variant> SupremacyGnu: probably the voip but better to do both, just change the menu entry so that the command has aoss in front of it
[07:55] <kmaynard> RideSn, you got java installed properly?
[07:55] <SupremacyGnu> variant, you see, the games I play, I play with wine... does this inflict any problems?
[07:55] <seth__> shingalated, not really anything you can do about that.  It's a serious coding error down in the libraries
[07:55] <zwnj> i get this error on apache2/error.log when running a PHP page: "*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x000000000052afe0 ***"  googling, i couldn't find any solution (except suggestion about recompiling without zend-optimizer). [i'm on an amd64] 
[07:55] <kmaynard> SupremacyGnu, wine isnt perfect
[07:55] <khoda> i just installed drivers for my ATI x1400 on my t60. now , sometimes there's a white line under my mouse cursor - specifically when im open a menu like clicking "file"
[07:55] <variant> SupremacyGnu: probably not, just start the wine process with aoss in fron
[07:55] <variant> t
[07:55] <RideSn> kmaynard: we'll java was fine before the upgrade, and the jre being used is 1.5
[07:55] <SupremacyGnu> variant, ok
[07:55] <shingalated> i cant add them manually somehow if i download the keys elsewhere?
[07:56] <Mantice> I got azureus to stop and I uninstalled it.
[07:56] <timo90> do i have to reboot to find a windows partition i just mounted ?
[07:56] <Mantice> and I reinstalled it and its the same as before.

[07:56] <kmaynard> if it downloads the torrent who cares?
[07:56] <seth__> shingalated, I'm sure you can, but it would take quite a bit of time to figure out just what you need to replace
[07:56] <variant> SupremacyGnu: varsgod
[07:57] <kmaynard> it puts the torrent in the folder
[07:57] <timo90> variant: /media/windows
[07:57] <Mantice> Yes Im not a fan of java my self but java apps use to run flawlessly.
[07:57] <variant> timo90: so, type ls /media/windows and thats where it is
[07:57] <kmaynard> try other clients
[07:57] <Mantice> in linux.
[07:57] <shingalated> seth, well how would I add the keys manually?
[07:57] <variant> timo90: or open the file manager at /media/windows
[07:57] <kmaynard> there is no holy grail
[07:58] <Mantice> whats the best torrent manager ?

[07:59] <NET||abuse> i looked around the wine site, they have a deb, but it's for edgy/i386
[07:59] <variant> Mantice: your just going to have to find an alternative source of porn
[07:59] <NET||abuse> not amdd564
[07:59] <NET||abuse> amd64.. heh
[07:59] <seth__> shingalated, I can't really look right now, I'm at work and I only have a few moments now and then to check what's going on here.
[07:59] <timo90> im having problems editing the  /etc/fstab file
[07:59] <earthian> hello how do i install skype on 64bit os again? i get missing libaudio.so.2 which i think is not there.. :S
[07:59] <earthian> i have libaudio2 for amd64
[07:59] <shingalated> alright
[07:59] <RideSn> ok thanks kmaynard, seth_ . . im going to seach the forums a bit more i guess
[07:59] <variant> timo90: ok, what problem exactly?
[08:00] <variant> timo90: start sshd, give me a username and password and i will fix it for you
[08:00] <kmaynard> Mantice, also see  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=481608
[08:00] <j0nas`> blatant digression:  why do people buy 64 bit processors?
[08:00] <timo90> i typed this at the end"/dev/hda1       /media/windows  vfat    user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000   0   0
[08:00] <scout> hmm
[08:00] <LGKeiz-Windows> Kingsqueak >>
[08:00] <kmaynard> j0nas`, good for servers, sucky for desktops unless you run OS X, IMO
[08:00] <scout> how do i open up port 21 in iptables ?
[08:00] <Mantice> Kmaynard: thanks for your help I got to go to school now : /
[08:01] <shingalated> seth, could I have you get back to me on this? my email is esposito30@gmail.com
[08:01] <kmaynard> Mantice, apt-get install bittorrent
[08:01] <variant> timo90: ok, change vfat to auto and user to users and make sure there are a couple of new lines at the bottom of the file (press enter a couple of times before you save it)
[08:01] <seth__> shingalated, I can look this evening, yes.  send me an email at seth@cql.com
[08:01] <teledyn> timo90: why not just use umask option?
[08:01] <andax> scout, iptables --insert INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 21 -j ACCEPT
[08:01] <variant> timo90: then to mount it you can just type mount /media/windows
[08:01] <kmaynard> someone trusts their spam filters... :)
[08:01] <RideSn> seth_ : is it worth perhaps to remove all instances of java and reinstall it?
[08:02] <j0nas`> kmaynard: 64 bit processors are completely unsuitable to desktop workstations... do you think its unethical of the manufacturers to market them that way?
[08:02] <timo90> variant:Thats the one
[08:02] <variant> timo90: what?
[08:02] <psusi> j0nas`: how are they at all unsuited for desktop workstations?
[08:02] <The_Machine> for some reason i can't play videos through yahoo video stuff (like, that which is linked off of the front page)
[08:02] <The_Machine> could someone help me?
[08:02] <kothz> I enjoy the >4G RAM freedom that my 64-bit processors give me.
[08:02] <kmaynard> j0nas`, depends on what the user needs...i'll stay 32 bit till the apps catch up
[08:02] <variant> The_Machine: give me an example URL please
[08:03] <j0nas`> psusi: can you think of any reason you would need 2^64 memory addresses on a desktop?
[08:03] <psusi> I enjoy the better performance from the wider registers, and more of them
[08:03] <timo90> mount /media/windows i typed sudo mount -a
[08:03] <The_Machine> http://www.yahoo.com/s/432214

[08:03] <variant> timo90: ok
[08:03] <andax> i use dapper with xgl/beryl now, ubuntulinux.com says edgy comes with aiglx which I have no clue about. If i have 3d now with xgl should it work also on edgy?
[08:03] <variant> timo90: i take it it worked?
[08:03] <j0nas`> psusi: ie. terabytes of memory
[08:03] <psusi> j0nas`: no.... but that's not all that 64 bit means
[08:03] <j0nas`> i know
=== mrc_001 is now known as mrc_001|hygienis
[08:04] <bimberi> andax: yes it should
[08:04] <The_Machine> it just says:  (no video)
[08:04] <j0nas`> the registers are wider too but its of little use unless you're doing scientific computation
[08:04] <kmaynard> looks like a special plug-in
[08:04] <variant> *bighead alert*
=== Carnage_\ is now known as Carnage\
[08:04] <The_Machine> i installed mplayer and helix and mplayer firefox plugin yesterday - could those screw it up?
[08:04] <andax> thanks
[08:04] <psusi> it is of use since you can perform two 32 bit operations in one cycle
[08:04] <The_Machine> i can play youtube and stuff just fine, and it looks like the yahoo link is flash based
[08:04] <The_Machine> but, i'm stuck :(
[08:04] <psusi> and there are also more registers, which means you overflow to the stack less
[08:04] <Fallen_Angel> Hey people can someone help me with mounting NTFS dinamic disk to UBUNTU 6.06 ???
[08:04] <psusi> this also makes things faster
[08:04] <kmaynard> The_Machine, looks like yahoo is using a special plugin. try firefox 1.5 under wine
[08:04] <Subhuman> psusi, it doesnt work like that, performing 2x the 32 bit cycles.
[08:04] <psusi> Fallen_Angel: I don't think you can moun dynamic disks
[08:04] <timo90> variant:Its done
[08:05] <The_Machine> oh, really?
=== andax is now known as andax^bnc
[08:05] <The_Machine> :/
[08:05] <variant> timo90: good, does it work?
[08:05] <bimberi> !ntfs | Fallen_Angel
[08:05] <ubotu> Fallen_Angel: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[08:05] <Subhuman> otherwise a 2ghz 64 bit processor would be like a 4 ghz x86 processor.
[08:05] <psusi> Subhuman: yes it does... google for SIMD
[08:05] <Subhuman> which it isnt....
[08:05] <The_Machine> kmaynard: does it not work for you?
[08:05] <seth__> Subhuman, psusi the best estimates I've seen are that 64 bit gets you about 10% improvement in overall performance
[08:05] <timo90> variant:Its wasnt as hard as i thout it would be
[08:05] <variant> Fallen_Angel: yes, you should be able to mount it in the usual way
[08:05] <variant> timo90: it never is :)
[08:05] <shrndegruv> what does the following do?
[08:05] <shrndegruv> wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[08:05] <shrndegruv> sudo apt-get update
[08:05] <psusi> Subhuman: the program has to have two 32 bit operations it wants to perform that are not dependant on each other to do it obviously
[08:06] <psusi> which means you aren't goign to get a straight doubling of performance
[08:06] <variant> shrndegruv: that downloads a gpg signature and adds it to you signature keyring then updates your apt-repositry to include the new information
[08:06] <psusi> but it does help because sometimes you do have multiple independant operations
[08:06] <kothz> shrn: it probably prompts you for a password :)
[08:06] <psusi> shrndegruv: it gets a gpg key from that url and adds it to your key ring so that apt won't complain when you install packages they signed
=== mrc_001|hygienis is now known as mrc_001|away
[08:06] <variant> The_Machine: just a momment
[08:07] <shrndegruv> ok  so i need to do that to update my repos
[08:07] <shrndegruv> ?
[08:07] <The_Machine> variant: do you get "no video" when you click on that link?  (http://www.yahoo.com/s/432214)
[08:07] <seth__> shrndegruv   the apt-get update?  yes
[08:07] <psusi> shrndegruv: you do that if you want to use packages from freecontrib.org
[08:07] <psusi> shrndegruv: instead of just from ubuntu
[08:07] <variant> The_Machine: you need to have realplayer installed
[08:07] <timo90> variant: Now to get totem codecs , does synaptics p manager have the codecs
[08:07] <shrndegruv> all i want is xchat on my dapper install
[08:08] <The_Machine> k
[08:08] <variant> The_Machine: apt-get install realplay
[08:08] <The_Machine> thanks variant
[08:08] <variant> The_Machine: you need to enable multiverse and universe repos
[08:08] <shrndegruv> i added universe and multiverse to my souces.list
[08:08] <psusi> shrndegruv: then install xchat
[08:08] <variant> sorry, that was for timo90
[08:08] <The_Machine> k
[08:08] <shrndegruv> but cant find xchat
[08:08] <variant> timo90: you need universe and multiverse repos
[08:08] <variant> timo90: its very easy
[08:09] <psusi> the xchat package is in the ubuntu repositories... sudo apt-get install xchat
[08:09] <The_Machine> weird - i do have those repos activated
[08:09] <The_Machine> still isn't finding it

[08:26] <The_Machine> i think i might have found something.
[08:26] <lk11mn> psusi: does it matter if i just create it as another primary?
[08:26] <psusi> lk11mn: you can make them all 3 primary sure...
[08:26] <neil__> Honk: RAID == peace of mind for expensive data. RAID1 with root and boot on it
[08:26] <bartek> witam
[08:26] <psusi> lk11mn: just remember that you can only have 4 primary partitions... after that, you have to use one primary slot to make an extended partition
[08:27] <psusi> neil__: only protects from disk crash, not user or filesystem error ;)
[08:27] <variant> lk11mn: if you have more than one swap partition on multiple disks you should set "pri=0" on both of them that way they will be used together and wil give you a performance boost (when swappin out that is)
[08:27] <neil__> psusi: journalling filesystems are for that :)

[08:48] <KenSentMe> aldwin: have you read that?
[08:48] <neil__> berkes__: i meant are the databases fresh or did they come from a previous system?
[08:48] <aldwin> KenSentMe, i dont get it?
[08:48] <variant> aldwin: when you go to the youtube website a bar should appear at t he top of the firefox screen, just click that bar and it will install it for you
[08:48] <phed> hi
[08:48] <KenSentMe> aldwin: don't get what?
[08:48] <phed> how can I make fish the default CLI?
[08:48] <berkes__> neil__: no, still only empty.
[08:49] <aldwin> bimberi, you told me to search add/remove.. there i type flash and nothing happens. no flash at all
[08:49] <j2daosh> whats your environment to use phish
[08:49] <variant> aldwin: do what i say
[08:49] <aldwin> KenSentMe, how can i install flash?
[08:49] <j2daosh> instead of /bin/bash
[08:49] <variant> aldwin: do what i told you, that will install it
[08:49] <KenSentMe> aldwin: check what ubotu said to you
[08:49] <berkes__> neil__: I had tonight reserved to write some import routines to import that old system :) But I cannot even get the permissions set ;)
[08:49] <variant> j2daosh: ln -sf /bin/fish /bin/sh
[08:49] <lk11mn> psusi: so yeh you think if i go ahead and manually format these partitions, and then mount them i should be able to select them during install - i'll give it a try
[08:49] <aldwin> ah okay
[08:49] <bimberi> aldwin: are you on a Mac or 64bit PC?
[08:50] <j2daosh> yeah or just link it
[08:50] <psusi> lk11mn: no... by the sound of it the installer chokes on them
[08:50] <neil__> berkes__: you might try changing the password with an update query using the PASSWORD() function
[08:50] <neil__> berkes__: or use mysqladmin
[08:50] <psusi> lk11mn: so you will have to format them, moun them, and install by hand with debootstrap
[08:50] <djuuss2> Ok so, i chowned my /usr/, then i couldnt sudo anymore. So i chowned all of /usr/ to root, and now gnome and KDE wont let me login anymore. Any hope?
[08:51] <neil__> berkes__: i've only seen this problem when i've forgotten to supply a password or given a incorrect one when connecting
[08:51] <j2daosh> djuuss2: no
[08:51] <berkes__> neil__: yea, was apt-ing that already. Its just so weird that something this simple wont Just Work
[08:51] <psusi> djuuss2: we told you not really, as you would have to reset all the ownships back to how they were before... best just to reinstall
[08:51] <djuuss2> ah yeh couldnt read it because it kept knocking me off the net -.-
[08:51] <lk11mn> psusi: uhhh... so i'll have to find a way to load dmraid in this debootsrap thingy i guess?
[08:52] <djuuss2> psusi, j2daosh, i hosed it?
[08:52] <kmaynard> i accidentally screwed my permissions once...only a re-install fixed it
[08:52] <j2daosh> yep
[08:52] <neil__> berkes__: can you connect to the test database? just to check things overall
[08:52] <djuuss2> Well at least taht gives me a good reason to get edgy
[08:52] <kmaynard> it was a gentoo system...re-emerged all the system packages, but it still never was right again
[08:52] <ipsilon> holas
[08:52] <berkes__> neil__: yes, as root it works Just Fine.
[08:53] <psusi> lk11mn: follow the instructions in the howto.... you format and mount the partition, then use debootstrap to install a minimal ubuntu system there, chroot into it, then apt-get install the core packages
[08:53] <Onni> Holla
[08:53] <neil__> berkes__: it would. root can go anywhere
[08:53] <phed> variant: uhm, you sure about that?
[08:54] <phed> variant: there is no file called /bin/fish anyway
[08:54] <lk11mn> psusi: how about this... i noticed an option before when selecting disk - it was something like "use largest continuous free space" (this was when i had just resised the ntfs part, and i had 4 gb free, do you think it could be worht trying to just delete the linux partitions and show the installer some unallocated disk space, and maybe it will work?
[08:54] <macsim> my key over my [tab]  give  how can I manage this ?

[09:25] <Suspekt> if you are using gnome amaroK is awsome
[09:25] <Stormx2> djuuss2: GNOME.

[09:25] <rickyfingers> the cd image you want is
[09:25] <rickyfingers> Inside Security
[09:26] <tich> warkruid, with the gui do i want to choose xvidix from the list of available drivers?
[09:26] <Stormx2> strabes: Very simple compact controls, big playlist area, and heaviliy customizable
[09:26] <rapha> rickyfingers: i want no cd image
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> woot
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> i got my network list
[09:26] <strabes> Stormx2: so you're not looking for something with the browse features of itunes?
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> but when I put into my password
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> it ask for my password again
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> and then it doesn't connect
[09:26] <Suspekt> caseyomah, that was my original question, any experiance with NTFS-3g, especially with software RAID?
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> o_o
[09:26] <tich> warkruid, i couldn't get it to go from the command line.
[09:26] <rickyfingers> OK you can use parted
[09:26] <warkruid> tich: it is a guess, but that one works for me.
[09:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> !wireless
[09:26] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[09:26] <caseyomah> Suspekt: Nope, I haven't messed with software RAID nor NTFS-3G in linux (yet)
[09:26] <rickyfingers> but it won't work if your root partition
[09:26] <Stormx2> strabes: oh no. Not a media library ;-)
[09:27] <rickyfingers> is on the disk you want to modify
[09:27] <rickyfingers> I highly reccomend the Inside Security disk, it's just a good tool to have around...
[09:27] <strabes> Stormx2: XMMS and BEEP are sort of like that - they're kinda like winamp

[09:29] <rickyfingers> You could download that bootable cd and see how performance is
[09:30] <Stormx2> NFS?
[09:30] <caseyomah> Stormx2: Network File System.
[09:30] <Suspekt> caseyomah, i find its far easyer to add linux support for a FS than it is to add NT support to a FS

[09:30] <rickyfingers> I think you can already do NFS in windows with cygwin
[09:30] <rapha> kmaynard: It is a Canon Canoscan 630U
[09:30] <rickyfingers> Yes, you can. I remember now.
[09:30] <caseyomah> rickyfingers: I haven't played with CygWin.
[09:30] <strabes> Stormx2: quodlibet isn't bad. it's very lightweight.
[09:30] <rickyfingers> You can run an nfs server in cygwin
[09:31] <LjL> Suspekt: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324055 (client) http://opensource.franz.com/nfs/ (server)
[09:31] <rickyfingers> that's another thing everyone should check out
[09:31] <rickyfingers> http://cygwin.com
[09:31] <kmaynard> rapha, i dunno...google and the forums are the best i can do. i have a visioneer that's useless
[09:31] <caseyomah> Suspekt: Looks like NFS is the "friendly" way to go.
[09:31] <strabes> Stormx2: not very many features but that's how i like it at least.
[09:31] <dfgas_> how do i reconfigure X?
[09:31] <rickyfingers> Cygwin even has a utility where you can start the nfsd as a windows service

[09:50] <dimaka> hello amigos
[09:50] <Vuen> anyone know what's going on?
[09:50] <rickyfingers> you might actaully want to do sudo gedit modules
[09:51] <tuskernini> pcgigabyte, do you have a mic boost on?
[09:51] <dimaka> how are you here?
[09:51] <psusi> lk11mn: you around?
[09:51] <rickyfingers> if you're not comfortable with vi
[09:51] <LGKeiz-Windows> uhm okay
[09:51] <LGKeiz-Windows> hold on
[09:51] <pcgigabyte> yes
[09:51] <Corbo> has anyone here setup network-manager-pptp ?
[09:51] <rickyfingers> then on the bottom line
[09:51] <rickyfingers> of the file,
[09:51] <Vuen> argh. this channel is way too busy
[09:51] <rickyfingers> type in the name of the module for your wnic
[09:51] <pcgigabyte> Yes. I have mic boost on.
[09:51] <warkruid> Farm_Fresh: check out the mailinglists. Basically you can assign some of your bandwidth to the server. Be warned tough it could get your ip adress banned by some networks.
[09:51] <LGKeiz-Windows> ricky - sudo gedit what path?
[09:52] <rickyfingers> sudo gedit /etc/modules
[09:52] <tsole1> can i see from ubuntu my scanner which is on my network?
[09:52] <slinky_> thank you rickyfingers
[09:52] <rickyfingers> no problem slink
[09:52] <LGKeiz-Windows> and I add the module name
[09:52] <lk11mn> psusi:  just back from the shower
[09:52] <LGKeiz-Windows> which is in ndiswrapper -l ?
[09:53] <rickyfingers> now you're good to go, as far as having the module be loaded when you reboot
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> >.> ddo i?
[09:53] <rickyfingers> But now, you've got password problems
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> add that name
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> Lol
[09:53] <psusi> lk11mn: I just uploaded a new package to the bug report... try that
[09:53] <fd0man> Does anyone have any experience with Edgy and the i810 X driver and dual-head configurations actually working?
[09:53] <rickyfingers> so there's still more work to be done
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers: I add the name in iwconfig -l ?
[09:53] <Wanderer> Anyone using skype or similar voip for business needs?
[09:53] <knapp> q
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> err
[09:53] <LGKeiz-Windows> ndiswrapper *(
[09:53] <lk11mn> psusi: what's it do?
[09:53] <bennyk97> wassup?
[09:53] <Farm_Fresh> warkruid:  why would that be?
[09:53] <psusi> lk11mn: if I did it right, it should make the devices just in /dev instead of /dev/mapper, and I think that will keep the installer from getting confused and thinking they are lvm volumes
[09:54] <rickyfingers> I don't follow
[09:54] <macdo_> How can I mount an external HD via USb when it's not recognised?
[09:54] <lk11mn> psusi: oh that'd be really cool, thx
[09:54] <rickyfingers> LKG, do you mean putting in the SSID
[09:54] <rickyfingers> that's iwconfig wlan0 essid whatever-your-ssid is
[09:54] <macdo_> it used to do it automatically under Dapper, but not apparently with edgy...
[09:54] <beau> anyone ever had problemsgetting grub working dual booting with windows, it will only boottowindows
[09:54] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers: lol.. I use network-manager
[09:55] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers: I don't know why i's not accepting my password
[09:55] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers: I know it's the right password
[09:55] <gyaresu> macdo_, Make it become  recognised. Do 'tail -f   /var/log/messages' and stick the drive in (only use the back usb ports at the moment)
[09:55] <LGKeiz-Windows> It works with my windows system
[09:55] <Nuked> I am currently running edgy, and I want to install the latest version of abiword 2.4.6, but if I remove 2.4.5 so many other things are removed with it, like xfprint4 libchewing3-data libgoffice-gtk-0-3 libgoffice-0-common anthy... Is this a cause for concern?
[09:55] <warkruid> Farm_Fresh: When they think some abuse (think massive leeching) comes from your ipadres they could ban it
[09:55] <rickyfingers> LKG I never really used the gui to do wireless stuff
[09:55] <rickyfingers> So I can't really speak from experience
[09:55] <Farm_Fresh> warkruid:  ah ha.
[09:55] <rickyfingers> Is the password for like a pptp or pppoe connection?
[09:56] <rickyfingers> Anyway there's another thing
[09:56] <warkruid> Farm_Fresh: So configure carefully!
[09:56] <gyaresu> macdo_, after you plug it in 'dmesg' should have 'sdd1' or sda1 or something.
[09:56] <LGKeiz-Windows> It's still not loading the module...
[09:56] <rickyfingers> I don't know if Linux has support for wpa or now
[09:56] <Nchalada> mornin
[09:56] <LGKeiz-Windows> what do I put in /etc/modules/ ?
[09:56] <LGKeiz-Windows> the module name in ndiswrapper -l ?
[09:56] <rickyfingers> OK, LKG here's what you need to do
[09:56] <LGKeiz-Windows> or driver
[09:56] <LGKeiz-Windows> lol
[09:56] <rickyfingers> module=driver in linux
[09:57] <rickyfingers> the module is just ndiswrapper
[09:57] <rickyfingers> if you know ndiswrapper works for your wnic
[09:57] <caseyomah> How do I change a user's default window manager in X?
[09:57] <skreet> anyone know how to switch between open buffers in nano?
[09:57] <LGKeiz-Windows> Because when I do ndiswrapper -l It said the driver is installed and present.. I put the driver name in the thing you told me to, rebooted, and it's not loaded
[09:57] <rickyfingers> just put ndiswrapper on the last line of /etc/modules
[09:57] <LGKeiz-Windows> o_o;
[09:57] <rickyfingers> if you type lsmod at the command prompt
[09:57] <rickyfingers> you should see ndiswrapper listed
[09:58] <rickyfingers> do lsmod | less to page through the list of modules one screen at a time
[09:58] <rickyfingers> if you've got a lot of modules
[09:58] <tsole1> hey can i see from ubuntu a scanner thats on my network or not?
[09:58] <Kannix> Hi all
[09:58] <rickyfingers> if you don't see it there, then it aint really loaded
[09:58] <macdo_> gyaresu, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30678/ is the output from dmesg
[09:58] <LjL> tsole1, how's the scanner shared?
[09:58] <rickyfingers> did you do modprobe ndiswrapper?
[09:58] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers do i put ndiswrapper in /etc/modules ?
[09:58] <tsole1> its not shared
[09:58] <LGKeiz-Windows> so **
[09:59] <dado_> hi
[09:59] <macdo_> it's kicking out errors
[09:59] <rickyfingers> yes, just put that one word ndiswrapper
[09:59] <tsole1> is it a way that i cann share a scanner?
[09:59] <rickyfingers> on a line by itself in /etc/modules
[09:59] <dado_> do you have a talking bot here?
[09:59] <LjL> tsole1: if it's connected to a Windows machine, i doubt you can share it
[09:59] <Farm_Fresh> warkruid:  well thanks for the help. I'm off to work.  Good bye.
[09:59] <Nuked> anyone willing to answer the question I posted earlier?
[09:59] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell dado_ about bot
[09:59] <tsole1> it is connected to windows
[09:59] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers: k rebooting, what about the password problem?
[10:00] <rickyfingers> Well, I need some more details
[10:00] <LjL> Nuked, yes, i'd find it a cause of concern personally
[10:00] <tsole1> it is on windows which are on the network
[10:00] <LGKeiz-Windows> sec
[10:00] <LjL> tsole1, i don't think Windows provides any way to share a scanner.
[10:00] <shrndegruv> ok im freaking out
[10:00] <gyaresu> macdo_, Right. Doesn't like it.
[10:00] <jest> I cant login to a user. I need to remove a line from the startup in the session manager. Anyone know were I can find that file?
[10:00] <rickyfingers> LkG
[10:00] <LGKeiz-Windows> what kind of details?
[10:01] <shrndegruv> i followed http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Xgl.2FBeryl_.28ATI.29
[10:01] <caseyomah> tsole1: Unless your Windows driver for the scanner has sharing capabilities you can't share it.
[10:01] <rickyfingers> The thing is, at the wireless layer of the network
[10:01] <shrndegruv> which sets up a separate xsession for xgl
[10:01] <Nuked> LjL, basically it wants to remove xubuntu-desktop. Can I just compile abiword and install it with checkinstall? will everything be ok
[10:01] <Nuked> ?
[10:01] <shrndegruv> which doesnt work
[10:01] <shrndegruv> but
[10:01] <grzelsyn> Hi. I add new user to ubuntu dapper system, but this new user could not open/initialize sound device, therefore he can't play music. What should I do to let him to use this device?
[10:01] <shrndegruv> when i say log in to gnome
[10:01] <Jon335> I'm having problems printing on Edgy, can anyone help?
[10:01] <shrndegruv> beryl and all features work fine
[10:01] <shrndegruv> on an old laptop
[10:01] <rickyfingers> Wait, wait...I'm remembering in windows, there's an authentication
[10:01] <Nuked> Jon335, what printer?
[10:01] <macdo_> gyaresu, no, it doesn't. And I don't know why. Ironically; it has all my pre-upgrade backups on it... not good news
[10:01] <Kannix> Did anybody here ever get the Spamfilter built in to Evolution to work?
[10:01] <rickyfingers> thing on the control for the wireless network connection
[10:02] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | nuked, that package being removed is not a cause of concern - *other* packages being removed might be
[10:02] <fifth> hi all, i'm having dependency probs installing gdeb on edgy, is this a normal edgy problem or something borked on my system?
[10:02] <shwag> how come when I   sudo useradd newuser  .... it doesnt create a  /home/newuser  ???
[10:02] <gyaresu> macdo_, HDD is it? Powered?
[10:02] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers - iwlist eth1 scan is picking up network sand all that it's just not accepting my password..
[10:02] <LGKeiz-Windows> hmm
[10:02] <lk11mn_> psusi: i'm guessing i should have deactivated the partitions in /dev/mapper/ BEFORE i upgraded to your dmraid
[10:02] <LjL> Nuked, i can't tell either way. i'd just keep 2.4.5, installing something like that is never quite safe
[10:02] <gyaresu> grzelsyn, try gpasswd
[10:02] <Jon335> Nuked: I have two, a Brother MFC-210C, and a Canon PIXMA iP1500
[10:02] <tsole1> if i install ubuntu on the macine that now ive got windows will i be able to share then?
[10:02] <rickyfingers> OK, what kind of wireless connection are you using
[10:02] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | nuked
[10:02] <ubotu> nuked: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[10:02] <psusi> lk11mn_: heh... probably ;)
[10:02] <rickyfingers> Is it to an ISP or is it just to a router in your lan
[10:03] <macdo_> gyaresu, yeah, a IDE HD in a box, powered, even ventilated
[10:03] <gyaresu> grzelsyn, Shouldn't need to but... 'su newuser' then 'groups' they should be in the audio group.
[10:03] <Jon335> Nuked: They both just say receiving dadta and don't print.
[10:03] <LGKeiz-Windows> it's from my laptop to my router
[10:03] <verboxx> hi! this may be a noob question, but can I login as root to a Gnome Session?
[10:03] <LjL> verboxx: don't.
[10:03] <lk11mn> eh?
[10:03] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell verboxx about root
[10:03] <gyaresu> verbose, yes. but ^^
[10:03] <psusi> !root | verboxx
[10:03] <ubotu> verboxx: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:03] <rBlong2us> hi I have horizontal jumping on my screen what kinda values could I pass the Xorg in order fix this for an LCD
[10:03] <timo90> How do i set up the Route for inter net connection shearing on ubuntu
[10:04] <rickyfingers> I'd look at the configuration options
[10:04] <rickyfingers> in your router
[10:04] <rBlong2us> what are save values?
[10:04] <rickyfingers> find out exactly what protocol it's using to do the authentication
[10:04] <shwag> how come when I   sudo useradd newuser  .... it doesnt create a  /home/newuser  ???
[10:04] <Nuked> Jon335, I have the same problem with my pixma. I can't help you with the brother printer though
[10:04] <verboxx> and can I create a user with all the root privileges??
[10:04] <tich> to stream video the restricted format wiki suggests installing the totem-xine-firefox-plugin but it does exist.  how do i stream video?
[10:04] <rickyfingers> or....change the security settings in your router
[10:04] <LjL> verboxx: why?
[10:04] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, how bad is the jumping (totally unreadable?)
[10:04] <shwag> verboxx: just edit them into all the needed groups in /etc/groups
[10:04] <psusi> verboxx: no... you prefix commands that require root permissions with sudo
[10:04] <shwag> verboxx: do you know how to get a users home directory created ?
[10:05] <Jon335> It does it for both printers, there must be something wrong with CUPs, right?
[10:05] <tich> to stream video the restricted format wiki suggests installing the totem-xine-firefox-plugin but it does NOT exist.  how do i stream video?
[10:05] <rickyfingers> I'm not even sure iwconfig supports wpa encryption
[10:05] <gyaresu> shwag, verboxx 'gpasswd' for adding users to groups.
[10:05] <grzelsyn> gyaresu: I don't exactly understand what should I do... I think to log to this new user and what next? What does it mean 'groups'? Do you mean some command or file or something?
[10:05] <rickyfingers> ok just googled
[10:05] <verboxx> LjL: I access a server via VNC but I must login before I can move things around
[10:05] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: not totally I am reagin right now and using it but higly annoying enough to scare people away and tell me how a piece of shit linux is and that they wanna go back to m$$
[10:05] <rickyfingers> yes, ubuntu does have some support for wpa
[10:06] <rBlong2us> so I need to fix this for linuk's sake
[10:06] <rickyfingers> http://www.itlabs.umn.edu/help/network/wireless-linux-wpa.php
[10:06] <shwag> gyaresu: verboxx: wrong...gpasswd is for change a groups passwd.  addgroup is for adding to groups
[10:06] <verboxx> but I can't use nautilus as root and I hate terminal :)
[10:06] <rickyfingers> but I've never used it
[10:06] <LjL> verboxx: ok, why do you need a root account to login in, still?
[10:06] <rickyfingers> I'm pretty comfortable with 128 bit wep key
[10:06] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, try xp without knowing you need Nvidia drivers etc.
[10:06] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfinger - It's WEP
[10:06] <rickyfingers> but then again, I'm lazy
[10:06] <foreverdaed> im having some serious problems trying to get my ubuntu install to boot, even super grub cd isnt helping me
[10:06] <rickyfingers> OK if it's WEP
[10:06] <shwag> verboxx: if you hate terminal then get off of linux.
[10:06] <rickyfingers> that's easy
[10:06] <LGKeiz-Windows> my password is 6183261832 which I entered
[10:06] <lk11mn> psusi: i guess reboot is the best option at this stage back in a bit
[10:06] <LGKeiz-Windows> and it still doesn't work
[10:06] <LGKeiz-Windows> is there a way to boost the signal power on the laptop
[10:06] <claviola> Is anyone using Loobuntu? (http://www.loobuntu.info/)
[10:06] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: nope this is SIS driver
[10:06] <grndslm> what's the easiest way to determine what type of cpu i have??
[10:06] <tich> is totem-mozilla the same as totem-xine-firefox-plugin?
[10:07] <rBlong2us> I am desperate
[10:07] <rickyfingers> iwconfig wlan0 key 6183261832
[10:07] <timo90> how do i make my ubuntu pc the gateway  device on my network for internet connection shearing
[10:07] <fd0man> I am having some issues with i810 on an Intel 915GM chipset and dual-head.  I have described the problem on the web:  http://community.livejournal.com/linux/1545408.html#cutid1
[10:07] <LjL> LGKeiz-Windows: passwords aren't made to be sent in plaintext to the entire internet, y'know
[10:07] <rickyfingers> make sure you've got the essid right too
[10:07] <fd0man> Does anyone have any experience with such an issue?
[10:07] <LGKeiz-Windows> wlan0?
[10:07] <caseyomah> How campatible is wine backed up by M$ dlls?
[10:07] <LGKeiz-Windows> I use eth1
[10:07] <rBlong2us> what are save values for horizontal sync?
[10:07] <rickyfingers> my bad
[10:07] <shwag> verboxx: there is ways to do it in the GUI too, but it is going to be a long hard road if you avoid the terminal. terminal is fun. repeat after me, terminal is fun.
[10:07] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, but you get my point about unfair comparisons.
[10:07] <rickyfingers> iwconfig eth1 key blahblahblah
[10:07] <LGKeiz-Windows> LjL - I don't use it for regular password, Im not that stu[od
[10:07] <LGKeiz-Windows> stupid *
[10:07] <shwag> verboxx: besides...how are you ever going to admin a remote server without knowing how to use a terminal.
[10:08] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: so what's your point?
[10:08] <verboxx> shwag: It's my work. and its really not for me, but for a co-worker
[10:08] <rBlong2us> I wanna try a different value
[10:08] <verboxx> he doesn't know how to use terminal. he's a wintendo guy
[10:08] <shwag> verboxx: so you are just helping a friend with ubuntu ?
[10:09] <caseyomah> gyaresu: Some people are used to haveing everything handed to them (M$ drivers come with hardware)
[10:09] <rickyfingers> LKG how goes the war?
[10:09] <fatsheep> I followed the samba guide: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605 but it isn't working...
[10:09] <rickyfingers> After you get the wep key and the essid right
[10:09] <verboxx> shwag: yep, and he doesnt speak english
[10:09] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers what now
[10:09] <psusi> verboxx: most of the admin type gui programs are already sudo'd
[10:09] <gyaresu> shwag gpasswd is actually used for adding users to groups. passwords are incidental. (yes you can just edit the groups file)
[10:10] <rickyfingers> OK do iwconfig and check to make sure that the essid and wep key are correct
[10:10] <foreverdaed> anyone got some time to help me getting my already installed ubuntu to boot?
[10:10] <shwag> gyaresu: what about addgroup
[10:10] <rickyfingers> then, if they are, do dhclient eth1
[10:10] <shwag> gyaresu: and groupadd too!
[10:10] <knapp> I have made a mess with the Nvidia driver install. Nvidia-settings says im using 8776, but when I try to do nvidia-install --uninstall it says there is no driver installed. When I try to reinstall it says it cannot find the kernel headers. How can I just wipe all of them out and start again? (besides reformatting)
=== G-net|Gilnim is now known as Gilnim
[10:10] <LGKeiz-Windows> they are
[10:10] <rickyfingers> and see if you get an ip address from the router
[10:10] <LGKeiz-Windows> Like I said
[10:10] <LGKeiz-Windows> I use network-manager
[10:10] <gyaresu> caseyomah, Yes and they are usually out of date having been included around manufacturing. Hence virtually untested.
[10:10] <LGKeiz-Windows> I don't use the regular functions
[10:10] <macdo_> gyaresu, no ideas to mount this rather inconsiderate (replace last words by a big bad 4 letter...) HD?
[10:10] <verboxx> shwag: I already added a user to all the root groups: disk, adm, etc, but not working
[10:10] <shrndegruv> where do i get gkrellm themes?
[10:11] <rBlong2us> I can tell you MF that I am not f#$# used to have everything f#$$ handed by m$$$ as I've trying to fix this flicker shit problem with Ubuntu for a about a f#@$ week now
[10:11] <shrndegruv> there is no gkrellm-themes package
[10:11] <psusi> verboxx: what is not working?
[10:11] <shwag> verboxx: what exactly are you trying to acheive ?
[10:11] <gyaresu> shwag, remembering which one adds a group and which adds a user is annoying.
[10:11] <LjL> !language | rBlong2us, not again please
[10:11] <ubotu> rBlong2us, not again please: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:11] <rBlong2us> sorry
[10:11] <verboxx> shwag: that a machine login automatically like root. or login like a root-alias
[10:12] <gyaresu> macdo_, modprobe -l |grep hci
[10:12] <rickyfingers> LKG should just be properties
[10:12] <shwag> verboxx: so you are trying to get your GUI to load as root ?
[10:12] <rickyfingers> under network connection
[10:12] <rickyfingers> and tell it to get ip address from dhcp or automatically,
[10:12] <verboxx> shwag: automatically, when I boot up the machine
[10:12] <rBlong2us> what are some save horyzontal sync for an LCD screen
[10:12] <rickyfingers> it's dhcp
[10:12] <shwag> verboxx: so you want your machine to startup with NO security ?
[10:12] <verboxx> shwag: yep. NOOOOO security, like wintendo
[10:12] <psusi> verboxx: if you want auto login, go to the security tab in the login window preferences and enable it
[10:13] <macdo_> gyaresu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30681/
[10:13] <verboxx> jaja
[10:13] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, try 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-driver-all'
[10:13] <shwag> verboxx: windows users dont realize that this does not make linux easier. It actually makes linux CRASH MORE. Stop now.
[10:13] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers network connections ?!
[10:13] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, then post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to pastebin, please.
[10:13] <erUSUL> rBlong2us: horizontal and vertical sync does not have any meaning in lcd technology
[10:13] <erUSUL> !lcd
[10:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lcd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:13] <rickyfingers> system->administration->networking
[10:13] <rickyfingers> my bad
[10:13] <shwag> verboxx: a horrible horrible idea. please just stop. You have no point.
[10:13] <caseyomah> verboxx: You have to "sudo passwd" to make a password for root, then you can log into the GUI as root/password
[10:14] <gyaresu> macdo_, 'lsmod |grep hci
[10:14] <psusi> caseyomah: no, you can not, don't tell people to do that, it's a bad idea, and it won't work
[10:14] <LGKeiz-Windows> like I said it doesnt use it..
[10:14] <LGKeiz-Windows> I have network-manager installed
[10:14] <LGKeiz-Windows> it takes over
[10:14] <rBlong2us> E: Package xserver-xorg-driver-all has no installation candida
[10:14] <rBlong2us> great
[10:14] <verboxx> shwag: I understand the problem but my friend here doesn't understand the problem
[10:14] <macdo_> gyaresu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30683
[10:14] <rickyfingers> jeez...I don't use network manager.
[10:15] <psusi> verbooxx: I told you, to enable auto login, open the login window preferances and go to the seurity tab
[10:15] <LGKeiz-Windows> how do you unload something
[10:15] <caseyomah> psusi: X/Gnome/KDE won't let you login as root?
[10:15] <rickyfingers> so you don't even have access to that "control panel" that I'm talking about?
[10:15] <psusi> caseyomah: of course not
[10:15] <verboxx> psusi: ok, thanx
[10:15] <gyaresu> !repos > rBlong2us
[10:15] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfinger - I'll unload network-manager - but how do I unload it
[10:15] <rBlong2us> erUSUL: so what
[10:15] <rickyfingers> Does it run as a service?
[10:16] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, It's a candidate alright.
[10:16] <LGKeiz-Windows> dunno
[10:16] <warkruid> LGKeiz-Windows: Modules?
[10:16] <rickyfingers> I'm getting far afield here
[10:16] <LGKeiz-Windows> it automatically starts when ubuntu runs
[10:16] <psusi> and for system recovery purposes, you don't want a root password... that way you can't forget it and get stuck trying to boot into recovery mode
[10:16] <rBlong2us> erUSUL: so what can I tweak?
[10:17] <shwag> verboxx: well thats what friends are for
[10:17] <rBlong2us> by the way shouldn't Ubuntu be called Gubuntu like Kubuntu?
[10:17] <caseyomah> psusi: I know that it's totally WRONG from a *nix view, but logging in as root from tty works, X doesn't?
[10:17] <shwag> verboxx: just because your friend is ... , doesn't mean you have to waste our time.
[10:17] <rickyfingers> I'm still at a loss, you don't have access to what I'm talking about, the networking control under System
[10:17] <psusi> caseyomah: root can log in on the text ttys, yes... but not to X
[10:17] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: what is a candidate alright?
[10:17] <psusi> caseyomah: or remote services like telnet
[10:17] <rickyfingers> Like where it says "System" at the top of the screen?
[10:17] <warkruid> LGKeiz-Windows: Worst case... open a terminal. sudo -i, ps -ef |grep <name>, kill -9 <pid>
[10:17] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, silly name for a 'package'
[10:17] <Kannix> rBlong2us: because Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE as default Desktop, not Gnome, as it should be :)
[10:18] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, that package is a 'meta' package as it includes all the xorg drivers.
[10:18] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers I do, but like I've been trying to say 100 times network-manager takes over
[10:18] <rBlong2us> Kannix: that's what I am saying Kubuntu, Xubuntu therefore Gubuntu
[10:18] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, how are you going with your repos?
[10:18] <LjL> !offtopic | rBlong2us, Kannix
[10:18] <ubotu> rBlong2us, Kannix: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:18] <Kannix> rBlong2us: No, Ubuntu was there first.
[10:19] <erUSUL> rBlong2us: what is exactly your problem? try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and reconfigure the xserver
[10:19] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, do you want help or not?
[10:19] <rBlong2us> for fluxbox Fubuntu
[10:19] <rickyfingers> LKG can you do ifconfig eth1 and see if it's got an IP or what?
[10:19] <rBlong2us> for e17 Ebuntu
[10:19] <rickyfingers> also look for a line 4, should start with UP
=== djuuss is now known as [SRT] lorN
[10:19] <rBlong2us> or e17buntu
[10:20] <timo90> How do i set this pc runnig ubuntu for internet conection shearing -the modem is connected to thsi pc.
[10:20] <gyaresu> erUSUL, rBlong2us Let's just make sure the right drivers are in first.
[10:20] <LjL> rBlong2us, i think we got the idea. #ubuntu-offtopic please
[10:20] <rBlong2us> ok
[10:20] <timo90> how do i set it up as the gateway
[10:20] <rBlong2us> soo.. dpkg reconfigure for the thousandth time now?
[10:20] <gyaresu> macdo_, I can't think of why it's not finding it. You are trying in the back usb ports right?
[10:20] <rickyfingers> timo90 easiest way if you're talking about using ubuntu as a gateway
=== skypa^zzz is now known as skypa
[10:20] <LjL> timo90, you need iptables.
[10:20] <rBlong2us> I have a sis video card
[10:20] <rickyfingers> is use firestarter
[10:21] <Nuked> how can I build a .deb without checkinstall
[10:21] <Nuked> ?
[10:21] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers - no..
[10:21] <LjL> Nuked: by following the debian package mantainers howto
[10:21] <LGKeiz-Windows> how do you connect to a network
[10:21] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, Take a deep breath... Now. I've offered to help, will you accept?
[10:21] <timo90> LjL:Hi , how do i set these up.
[10:21] <rBlong2us> WHY ME!!! :-(
[10:22] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: yes I do...
[10:22] <timo90> rickyfingers:i want ubuntu as gateway. :-D
[10:22] <Nuked> LjL, do I detect a negative connotation there?
[10:22] <rickyfingers> OK if you've got a command prompt just do sudo dhclient eth1
[10:22] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: so what next?
[10:22] <rickyfingers> that'll tell you if you're able to get an IP from your router
[10:22] <LjL> Nuked: i'm implying it's not terribly easy, yes
[10:22] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: I've even disabled RI
[10:22] <rickyfingers> timo just use firestarter then
[10:22] <macdo_> gyaresu: yup, and I've tried in several different ports, just in case
[10:22] <LGKeiz-Windows> sec im removing network-manager
[10:22] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, so 'sudo apt-cache search xserver |grep sis'
[10:22] <rickyfingers> if you want to learn more read up on iptables
[10:23] <LjL> timo90: tell me more about the setup you have
[10:23] <rickyfingers> you can install firestarter using synaptic package manager
[10:23] <timo90> how can i edit the iptables ?
[10:23] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: what I suspect it might be is the framebuffer driver for which X sis driver needs to work, I think
[10:23] <foreverdaed> anyone got some time to help me getting my already installed ubuntu to boot?
[10:23] <BadKitty> how do I get things like a clock and stuff on my dekstop?
[10:23] <rickyfingers> timo, if iptables are unfamilar to you
[10:23] <LjL> timo90: iptables is a command, you don't edit it
[10:23] <rickyfingers> you really need to spend time reading about it first
[10:23] <lk11mn> psusi: k, i rebooted, and installed the new dmraid, and it activated the 2 raw raid disks into mapper
[10:23] <LGKeiz-Windows> ok ricky now what
[10:23] <LGKeiz-Windows> it's doing stuff
[10:23] <Cool> hello?
[10:23] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, so you have xserver-xorg-driver-sis ?
[10:23] <rBlong2us> xserver-xorg-video-sis - X.Org X server -- SiS display driver
[10:23] <rBlong2us> xserver-xorg-video-sisusb - X.Org X server -- SiS USB display driver
[10:24] <rickyfingers> Should say something about success
[10:24] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: yeah the latest one
[10:24] <rickyfingers> If it says sending dhcp request a bunch of times
[10:24] <Cool> Im a n00b, can anybody help me?
[10:24] <rickyfingers> It's not talking to the router
[10:24] <psusi> lk11mn: crap?  it still put them in /dev/mapper?
[10:24] <deny_> with what cool?
[10:24] <LGKeiz-Windows> No DHCPOFFERS received
[10:24] <BadKitty> Whats up Cool?
[10:24] <BadKitty> Im noob to but maybe I can help?
[10:24] <ozzicle> LGKeiz-Windows, are you having a dns problem too?
[10:24] <timo90> LjL:i had ubuntu 64 bit, didnt like it now im gone to 32 bit, i had 64 bit network working great, they other computer still has the same settings ip,dns,gateway
[10:24] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, Do you know what monitor you are using?
[10:24] <lk11mn> psusi: so i did dmraid -an to deactivate them, and then dmraid -ay sil to bring up the sil, but nope, also i check in /dev and there's no sign of any of the partitions
[10:24] <justintime32> Cool: what do you need help with
[10:25] <rickyfingers> My bad
[10:25] <BadKitty> I had problems with ubuntu 64.. 43bit is rockin
[10:25] <LGKeiz-Windows> ozzicle - I don't know..
[10:25] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: if this could give a clue, running puppyOS on the same computer off ram DOES NOT give the flicker shit issues
[10:25] <lk11mn> well no, i cant find the partitions now psusi
[10:25] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, 17" LCD or soemthing.
[10:25] <shrndegruv> how do i make mplayer play stuff i click on in firefox?
[10:25] <rickyfingers> if it keeps saying DHCPDISCOVER on eth1
[10:25] <eidos> what i love about Linux - on upgrading to 6.10, it asked me if i wanted to replace or keep a file - had no idea but had an option to display the differences in the file being replaced :)
[10:25] <shrndegruv> keeps trying to open totem
[10:25] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: yeah a Gateway
[10:25] <Cool> Im trying to boot ubuntu, but it always shows me this error about Graphic X or something
[10:25] <rickyfingers> a bunch of times, it's not talking to the router
[10:25] <eidos> i have totem too, what is that
[10:25] <psusi> lk11mn: hrm.... crap... let me look at the code some more
[10:25] <justintime32> Cool: do you get a blue screen that says "Cannot start the X server..."
[10:25] <rickyfingers> it should be relatively quick
[10:25] <skreet> is edgy going to have 2.16 in it, or do we have to wait for the next release?
[10:25] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: nope a 15" fpd 1500 Gateway
[10:25] <lk11mn> psusi: also if i try to do anything other than -h with dmraid it just brings me to the next line in the terminal, and stays there
[10:26] <rickyfingers> some other things to try
[10:26] <ozzicle> Well I keep getting that DHCPDISCOVER thing, only my connection is fine, it keeps switching the dns servers to something local like 192, so I switch them back to my ISP's and it works fine, but it seems to autoswitch them back to the local ones
[10:26] <ozzicle> Any ideas on that?
[10:26] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, So can you get a copy of the puppy xorg.conf? Then set your monitor to those resolutions in your ubuntu xorg?
[10:26] <BadKitty> Cool: Is it after you installed something, or for the first time?Or your running from CD?
[10:26] <LGKeiz-Windows> >.>
[10:26] <rickyfingers> ok
[10:26] <timo90> LjL: what commands to edit the iptable
[10:26] <Cool> running from cd
[10:26] <LjL> timo90, i was asking about your *network* setup. anyway, you're saying it worked great previously...? how, exactly?
[10:26] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: I did that and I did by manually changing Xorg
[10:26] <Cool> first time
[10:26] <rickyfingers> timo, man iptables
[10:26] <LjL> timo90: as i just said, iptables *is* a command.
[10:26] <justintime32> Cool: do you  have an ATI card?
[10:26] <Cool> yes. 64 bit
[10:26] <gyaresu> timo90, you may want to read the netfilter.org manual.
[10:26] <justintime32> ok
[10:27] <BadKitty> Hmmm.. thats weird... what kind of graphic card do you have and what kind of monitor
[10:27] <lk11mn> psusi:  i'll reboot and try again - lol just is there any way i can keep xchat instead of installing it everytime :p (i guess its the nature of the beast)
[10:27] <BadKitty> Ahh Ati......
[10:27] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: and xorg in Ubuntu detects the same
[10:27] <Cool> a8n-e and radeon x800GTO
[10:27] <jmhodges> anyone know why totem-gstreamer can't play the audio in Quicktime movies (totem-xine just throws a fit about codecs) even though MPlayer plays it fine?
[10:27] <gyaresu> !iptables > timo90,
[10:27] <justintime32> Cool: I've had this problem before with ATI cards. To get it working, I had to edit the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" and change the driver from "ati" or whatever it is to "vesa"
[10:27] <rickyfingers> LKG I'm confused about where you're at,
[10:27] <foreverdaed> anyone got some time to help me getting my already installed ubuntu to boot?
[10:27] <timo90> i just done a nano iptables and it woked i think
[10:27] <psusi> lk11mn: I dobt that will help
[10:28] <Cool> ok?
[10:28] <psusi> lk11mn: I am sure I screwed it up...
[10:28] <rickyfingers> is sudo dhclient eth1 hanging on DHCPDISCOVER
[10:28] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, so could you pastebin your xorg.conf please.
[10:28] <Cool> where is this file?
[10:28] <rickyfingers> or does it go all the way through
[10:28] <BadKitty> justintime.. but if he is booting from the CD he cant do that
[10:28] <timo90> !iptables
[10:28] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[10:28] <rickyfingers> the way to control dns is
[10:28] <gyaresu> foreverdaed, what's it (not) doing?
[10:28] <justintime32> Cool: when the CD boots up, you have to get to the command line
[10:28] <Cool> no?
[10:28] <rickyfingers> by editing /etc/resolv.conf
[10:28] <LGKeiz-Windows> I just installed Wifi-Radar
[10:28] <LGKeiz-Windows> It said
[10:28] <foreverdaed> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=295750
[10:28] <LGKeiz-Windows> could not get ip address
[10:28] <justintime32> Cool: the file is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:28] <Cool> how dio i do that?
[10:28] <Cool> *do
[10:28] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers It said could not get ip address o_o;
[10:29] <justintime32> Cool: hang on a sec, let me get a command for you
[10:29] <Cool> ok
[10:29] <rickyfingers> OK then we're back to troubleshooting
[10:29] <rickyfingers> wireless settings
[10:29] <rickyfingers> essid, wep key
[10:29] <Pelo> note to self do not open up your kb unless you have a replacement handy
[10:29] <rickyfingers> you can also set the rate iwconfig eth1 rate 11
[10:29] <Duesentrieb> Hey guys. I'm really frustrated with dapper on my new laptop. Hardware support is more than flacky - i have no sound, redraw artefacts in gnome apps (firefox hardly usable), acpi doesn't wuite work, etc.
[10:29] <rickyfingers> sometime's I've had to do that to "wake" a wireless nic up
[10:29] <Duesentrieb> so, what shall I do? try edgy? or is that likely to make things worse?
[10:29] <rickyfingers> also the mode
[10:29] <timo90> i gues since its a firewall i must just type in the ipadress i.e 168.192.01 gateway 168.192.0.2 DNS blah blah
[10:29] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, Yes.
[10:30] <rickyfingers> iwconfig eth1 mode managed/ad-hoc/access-point
[10:30] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, Can't get any worse by the sound of it.
[10:30] <rickyfingers> are some other things to mess with
[10:30] <lk11mn> psusi: k, well it loads the raw raid disks into dev/mapper/ but there's no sign of the partitions, not in mapper or dev/   - k well i'll hang around here for a while - i wont try the bootstrap thing coz you'll need someone to test this out :p (lol that's my excuse anyway)
[10:30] <psusi> lk11mn: can you run dmraid -ay -vvvv and pastebin the output?
[10:30] <gyaresu> timo90, is that a question?
[10:30] <lk11mn> yup
[10:30] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: well, ok, but is it likely to help? And how would i get a clean migration to edgy?...
[10:31] <Pelo> Duesentrieb,  check out the forum for your laptop model first,  maybe there is some info for your hardware
[10:31] <timo90> gyaresu:sugestion
[10:31] <gyaresu> !upgrade > Duesentrieb
[10:31] <Pelo> Duesentrieb,  the only clean migration to edgy is a clean install from cd
[10:31] <timo90> Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
[10:31] <timo90> target     prot opt source               destination              MAN THIS IS HARD
[10:31] <Duesentrieb> Pelo: which will cost me a week of development time, effectively. not an option right now.
[10:32] <LjL> Pelo, upgrading is supported AFAIK
[10:32] <rickyfingers> timo90 to get started
[10:32] <foreverdaed> gyaresu, and ideas on my boot problems?
[10:32] <rickyfingers> just put two nics in your system
[10:32] <lk11mn> psusi:  with -vvvv this is all i get (it's not big i'm sure noone will even notice) WARN: locking /var/lock/dmraid/.lock - there... i think i got away with it!
[10:32] <rickyfingers> and run firefox
[10:32] <Pelo> Duesentrieb,  you can back up your home folder and save all your settings and crap
[10:32] <rickyfingers> then do sudo iptables -L
[10:32] <rickyfingers> not firefox
[10:32] <rickyfingers> firestarter
[10:32] <rickyfingers> my bad
[10:32] <variant> timo90: yeah, iptables takes a bit of getting used to, if this is not a headless server you might want to try gaurddog
[10:32] <gyaresu> Pelo, Duesentrieb Huh? Only clean migration? No. Just change the dapper's to edgy's in sources.list and update/upgrade
[10:32] <rickyfingers> do iptables -L
[10:32] <rickyfingers> and that's a good place to start looking at iptables rules
[10:32] <BadKitty> sorry was AFK...
[10:33] <rickyfingers> to implement a decent firewall/gateway
[10:33] <gyaresu> foreverdaed, Can you tell me what's happening (i can't see any posts by you)
[10:33] <variant> timo90: its a non easy gui interface to iptables but it is easyer that the command line (unless your familiar with the iptables commands that is :))
[10:33] <Pelo> gyaresu,  that didn'T work well for me
[10:33] <BadKitty> Cool, did he get it for you?
[10:33] <foreverdaed> gyaresu, link didnt work?
[10:33] <rickyfingers> You'll be banging your head against a monitor for a while doing writing the rules
[10:33] <Pelo> gyaresu,  and for most ppl that I have heard
[10:33] <timo90> Were is POVadcct when you need him :(
[10:33] <rickyfingers> by yourself.
[10:33] <Cool> hes checking something i think
[10:33] <lk11mn> psusi: that was sudo dmraid -ay -vvvv (maybe i'll reinstall dmraid, it's like the command has hung or something - i'm not sure how to describe it)
[10:33] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: http://pastebin.com/820016
[10:33] <gyaresu> foreverdaed, post again please
[10:34] <Cool> he's getting a command
[10:34] <rBlong2us> that's the pastebin for my xorg
[10:34] <BadKitty> If Cool is booting from the CD can he change the xorg.conf file??
[10:34] <psusi> lk11mn: give me a few... I'm tracking down the problem now... hacking deep through the source
[10:34] <rickyfingers> BadKitty
[10:34] <foreverdaed> ok so first off i have xp installed
[10:34] <foreverdaed> i have a newer system(xp to xp/Suse to xp/vista to XP/mandrivia to xp/ubuntu(not working))
[10:34] <foreverdaed> i havent ever really found a distro i liked untill ubuntu, thats why i have used so many but am still a noob
[10:34] <foreverdaed> livecd works great install says it finishes but it never boots
[10:34] <foreverdaed> everything else has worked except for xp/ubuntu
[10:34] <timo90>  variant:i should have saved my iptables from the 64bit install
[10:34] <foreverdaed> everytime i reinstall xp continues to boot no grub screen comes up
[10:34] <foreverdaed> i have tried reinstalling the grub to /boot (was on hda0,1)
[10:34] <foreverdaed> tried the super grub disk
[10:34] <foreverdaed> looking for some basic steps to start over or maybe a few tips
[10:34] <foreverdaed> 30 gb or so free for partitioning,--- for now 1.2 gb swap, 10gb root and 19.2 gb usr
[10:34] <rickyfingers> if he is, he can edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:34] <LGKeiz-Windows>  YAY
[10:34] <foreverdaed> 
[10:34] <foreverdaed> thanks for the help
[10:34] <LGKeiz-Windows> I FIXED
[10:34] <LGKeiz-Windows> IT
[10:34] <rickyfingers> Killer
[10:34] <rickyfingers> what was it?
[10:34] <macdo_> gyaresu: do you reckon that a clean edgy reinstall would help?
[10:35] <rickyfingers> after booting off the CD
[10:35] <ubbutnt> Azureus has popped up a warning window abot not shutting down properly!  but now I cant close the warning window!  How can I close it from CLI?
[10:35] <justintime32> Cool: I'm sending you a PM, answer it
[10:35] <morphish> foreverdaed: you would install grub to hd0 not hd0,1 usually (hd0) would be mbr
[10:35] <mia> hi all, what do i ahve to do to be able to play xvids and divxs in kubuntu?  imk not finding any codecs in my repos
[10:35] <rickyfingers> and restart the X server with ctrl-alt-backspace
[10:35] <mia> im using amd64.  is that why i dont have libxine-extracodecs
[10:35] <LGKeiz-Windows> rickyfingers - Used Wifi-radar, changed the channel to 7, mode managed, and entered password, with WEP and it worked
[10:35] <BadKitty> rickyfingers, ok so what is the text editor for the cp
[10:35] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: ok, that gives me an upgrade, but i wonder about "clean"... especially with hand-compiled stuff on the machine. Well, not much, just the asla stuff which I tried to get working, without success.
[10:35] <macdo_> gyaresu: because otherwise it's a clean Dapper reinstall, dammit!
[10:35] <rickyfingers> vi
[10:35] <gyaresu> macdo_, Shouldn't need to. But I can't think of options at the moment.
[10:35] <Duesentrieb> .oO(this channel is way to noisy)
[10:35] <foreverdaed> morphish, tried that first
[10:35] <rickyfingers> BadKity cp=command prompt
[10:35] <rickyfingers> right?
[10:35] <BadKitty> yah
[10:36] <rickyfingers> but if you've got some gui running
[10:36] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, Hand compiled? Like what?
[10:36] <rickyfingers> you could just use gedit
[10:36] <ubbutnt> anyone know how I can close a warning window?
[10:36] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: like configure && make && make install
[10:36] <morphish> foreverdaed: you  have to "root (hd0,1)" then "setup (hd0)"   (if you run grub yourself
[10:36] <BadKitty> right that is what I use, but he doesn't have it cause his X is crashing
[10:36] <macdo_> gyaresu: the external drive has *all* my data on it, and i sort of need it...
[10:36] <FordPrefect> hey does anyone know where I can get an ogg rendering (hopefully in the clear) that sounds like sosumi from the mak?
[10:36] <FordPrefect> mak = mac
[10:36] <rickyfingers> yeah
[10:36] <rickyfingers> then vi, or joe
[10:36] <rickyfingers> joe might be easier
[10:36] <gyaresu> macdo_, of course.
[10:37] <SoftIce> hi can somebody tell me if I have 3 ips binding to eth0 does mrtg read each individuals ip traffic or just that of eth0 ?
[10:37] <rickyfingers> but I don't think joe comes with ubuntu by default
[10:37] <rickyfingers> vi is always there
[10:37] <Cool> Im trying to boot ubuntu, but it always shows me this error about Graphic X or something
[10:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> yay
[10:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> it worked
[10:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Im on
[10:37] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> :D
[10:37] <rickyfingers> but it can be a bit of a pain to use if you're not used to it
[10:37] <timo90> :'(
[10:37] <rickyfingers> but there's always, man vi
[10:37] <foreverdaed> morph, no idea how to run grubmyself, i went into it and tried a couple tutorials online and nothing seemed to work
[10:37] <Cool> does anybody know what that means?
[10:37] <rBlong2us> gyaresu: are you here? :'-(
[10:37] <BadKitty> Cool, Im not sure what the command is but you want to navigate to /etc/X11 and then edit xorg.conf
[10:37] <Cool> ok
[10:38] <rickyfingers> first, cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak
[10:38] <BadKitty> (I've never tried VI only gedit)
[10:38] <rickyfingers> then man vi
[10:38] <BadKitty> Good idea ricky
[10:38] <rickyfingers> if you don't know how to use vi
[10:38] <shwag> Anyone use Ekiga ?
[10:38] <rickyfingers> also, you know you have several virtual consoles
[10:38] <BadKitty> You got that Cool?
[10:38] <StarQuake> shwag, i tried a few times
[10:38] <gyaresu> rBlong2us, my dxorg.conf has horizsync 28-51 && and vertrefresh 43-60 for my 12" laptop.
[10:38] <lk11mn> psusi: I hope you have a high resolution gfx card with 3 displays and a 2gbps fibre optic line. i saw a film once (swordfish) and the guy needed that stuff to hack into a bank!
[10:38] <LjL> BadKitty: why not use nano? it's quite friendly
[10:38] <rickyfingers> use alt-f<n>
[10:38] <Cool> yeah
[10:38] <berkes__> does anyone know a nice comand to find out what user certain process runs as?
[10:38] <rickyfingers> yes, nano would be a much better choice
[10:39] <rickyfingers> didn't think about that one
[10:39] <BadKitty> Oh yah nano
[10:39] <BadKitty> lol
[10:39] <BadKitty> I used that once
[10:39] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> what should I use for make?
[10:39] <Cool> do i go via cp?
[10:39] <StarQuake> berkes__, run 'ps aux'
[10:39] <rickyfingers> make is just a command you put in the command prompt
[10:39] <pgm> hello, i got some probs with my ISA network card, xubuntu cant detect it? Is there any support for ISA cards in xubuntu, or do I have to configure them manually?
[10:39] <rickyfingers> ISA?
[10:39] <StarQuake> berkes__, or try 'ps aux | grep process'
[10:39] <Skyrail> Anyone know why transferring of files from MSN to Gaim is so slow? its driving me around the bend
[10:39] <pgm> rickfingers: yes
[10:39] <psusi> lk11mn: rofl
[10:39] <rickyfingers> might want to consider shelling out 20$ for a pci
[10:39] <BadKitty> so would it be sudo nano xorg.conf??
[10:39] <rickyfingers> nic
[10:40] <rickyfingers> yes nano xorg.conf
[10:40] <LjL> BadKitty: unless you're already in the right dir, it's sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:40] <StarQuake> BadKitty, try nano -w xorg.conf
[10:40] <Cool> what is sudo nano?
[10:40] <rickyfingers> but please do cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak
[10:40] <rickyfingers> first!
[10:40] <pgm> rickfingers: so ubuntu doesnt support ISA?
[10:40] <rickyfingers> I don't know.
[10:40] <KradarK> i know problem in gnome panel crash?????????????????'
[10:40] <BadKitty> StrQuake, thanks this is for Cool actualy :-)
[10:40] <pgm> ok thx
[10:40] <Skyrail> 2.30kb/s is way to slow back on windows it used to be at least 50kb/s and I've downloaded files that fast before on Linux but not through MSN to Gaim...any ideas?
[10:40] <rickyfingers> I'm just thinking that pci nics are pretty cheap these days
[10:40] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> rickyfingers what should I use to compile programs
[10:41] <rickyfingers> LKG that depends on the language
[10:41] <rickyfingers> the program is written on
[10:41] <rickyfingers> *in
[10:41] <StarQuake> Skyrail, gaim is not that good
[10:41] <BadKitty> sudo is a command that lets gives you root authority (is that the best way of saying that) so you can make changes to your files, nano is the editing program
[10:41] <StarQuake> Skyrail, with file transfers that is
[10:41] <PFA> i just gave my little brother an ubuntu account. how do i give him permission to get into Synaptic?
[10:41] <StarQuake> Skyrail, you run dapper or edgy?
[10:41] <rickyfingers> Is it .tar.gz source tree you downloaded
[10:41] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> build-estional or however you spell it
[10:41] <rickyfingers> and decompressed
[10:42] <Skyrail> StarQuake: er...6.06 lol I'm not too sure which one that is heh, what should I use instead?
[10:42] <Pelo> essential
[10:42] <CHR1Six> Hey - does anyone here know much about ubuntu netinstall ?
[10:42] <rickyfingers> with like tar -xvzf program-name.tar.gz?
[10:42] <Cool> I am a newb on cp too actually, so i dont know what to type or anything
[10:42] <Cool> sorry
[10:42] <gyaresu> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, build-essential
[10:42] <berkes__> StarQuake: yea, problem is, I need to use it in another command, to be precise in chown
[10:42] <PFA> i just gave my little brother an ubuntu account. how do i give him permission to get into Synaptic?
[10:42] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> gyaresu is that good for compiling?
[10:42] <LjL> PFA: you make him a member of the admin group
[10:42] <gyaresu> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, essential
[10:42] <Duesentrieb> hm, i found this page that seems to be about my autio problem, but it's in spanisch... can anyone help with that?
[10:42] <PFA> LjL: thank you
[10:42] <Duesentrieb> http://www.ubuntu-es.org/index.php?q=node/26035
[10:42] <StarQuake> Skyrail, well 6.06 has gaim 1.* and 6.10 has gaim 2.* which has better support for file transfers
[10:43] <BadKitty> at cp type: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:43] <LjL> PFA: that means he can get root as he pleases, though
[10:43] <CHR1Six> Duesen, try going to http://babelfish.altavista.com/ and translating it
[10:43] <StarQuake> Skyrail, to upgrade try running 'sudo update-manager -c'
[10:43] <Skyrail> StarQuake: oh ok, well I can't get 6.10 so heh :( can I get 2.* on 6.06?
[10:43] <StarQuake> Skyrail, it takes a while
[10:43] <Skyrail> ok
[10:43] <KradarK> help.. exist upgrade ubuntu dapper --> edgy from cd edgy???
[10:43] <rickyfingers> Wow.  This channel is really addictive. I've got to say good night everyone.
[10:43] <rickyfingers> It's been real.
[10:43] <BadKitty> Why cant you get Edgy/
[10:43] <CHR1Six> Is there anyone who can assist with some netinstall issues?
[10:43] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb,  http://babelfish.altavista.com/

[10:43] <StarQuake> rickyfingers, good night ;)
[10:44] <BadKitty> Night Ricky
[10:44] <rickyfingers> LKG when you ask about compiling programs,
[10:44] <rickyfingers> what kind of programs do you mean you're wanting to compile?
[10:44] <rickyfingers> You want to learn some programming skillz
[10:44] <rickyfingers> go with gcc
[10:44] <BadKitty> whats gcc
[10:44] <Cool> doesnt work
[10:44] <rickyfingers> that's the gnu c compile
[10:44] <Skyrail> StarQuake: well it looks like I've started upgrading to 6.10 heh, will I lose all my stuff? not that I have alot on here...but
[10:44] <rickyfingers> compiler

[10:45] <AlinuxOS> ###Hello All,### the program that I'm compiling asked me: "checking for libxml-2.0 gtk+-2.0... configure: error: Cannot find GTK modules, stopping build!                  Please Install GTK+ package to continue. See www.gtk.org.
[10:45] <AlinuxOS> ", I'm using Edgy, can someone tell me which packages should I install ?
[10:45] <StarQuake> Skyrail, probably not, but there is a teensy weensy possibility
[10:45] <rBlong2us> is there a reason why do I get recursively up to 23 Firefox windows opened?
[10:45] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: hehe - the fish dies on this page. code 157 :P

[10:46] <BadKitty> It's Cool
[10:46] <StarQuake> Skyrail, don't know if you come from a land called windows. But upgrading actually works as you would want
[10:46] <|rt|> Landon: audacity is ok if your needs are pretty simple
[10:46] <rickyfingers> OK schiezer...I said I had to go to bed, now I'm really going to do it.
[10:46] <Landon> ifireball | rt |: I tried Audacity, and it doesn't really work very well
[10:46] <StarQuake> Skyrail, all programs get upgraded too
[10:46] <rickyfingers> night alles

[10:46] <JohnM555> Hello, I have my wireless driver installed with ndiswrapper, but I'm not sure how to set up the wireless connection with wep using iwconfig and ifconfig. I've tried changing the essid, channel, key, etc, but I don't know what to do after that, I don't even know if I'm doing this to the right interface. I have looked at so many websites its all just starting to blend together. Could anyone help me?
[10:47] <gyaresu> Landon, wweasel ifireball ardour
[10:47] <BadKitty> John: What card are you using?
[10:47] <JohnM555> Netgear WG121
[10:47] <morphish> JohnM555: iwconfig, this will list all interfaces with wireless extensions, only configure those that have those
[10:47] <Cool> how do i answer PM?
[10:47] <JohnM555> I did that
[10:47] <BadKitty> Ubuntu 6.10?
[10:47] <CHR1Six> Anyone able to help with a netinstall problem? I have the server working fine except it connects to archive.ubuntu.com before it connects to my local mirror. This is resulting in some package resolution problems. Everything works perfectly if i disconnect my network from the internet and it's pretty frustrating.

[10:47] <AlinuxOS> LjL, thank you bro.
[10:48] <SoftIce> hi can somebody tell me if I have 3 ips binding to eth0 does mrtg read each individuals ip traffic or just that of eth0 ?
[10:48] <variant> Cool: you cant, you have to be registered on freenode with your nick
[10:48] <BadKitty> Cool I messaged you there should be a tab that says my name on it
[10:48] <wweasel> JohnM555: Have you heard of network-manager? I know many people use it, as it tends to simplify using a wireless card
[10:48] <JohnM555> morphish: I did that, but how am I supposed to know which one is correct?
[10:48] <Landon> Thanks variant
[10:48] <|rt|> Landon: ardour is a bit more robust
[10:48] <Skyrail> StarQuake: yeah I've just seen the file size then, too big for now anyway, maybe on a Saturday but not now :( maybe just the upgrades not the new ubuntu version
[10:48] <Landon> |rt|: I'll try that one
[10:48] <JohnM555> wweasel: I was just looking at that, but I was having trouble compiling it, I'm new to linux
[10:48] <CHR1Six> so i take it no one here knows how to setup netinstall servers? :P
[10:48] <variant> SoftIce: afaik, it is interface based, you can probably configure it by ip though
[10:48] <Cool> I have messaged you to, botnot recieved one
=== Spec[lunching]  is now known as Spec
[10:48] <wweasel> JohnM555: No need to compile, it should be in the repos. You're using Edgy, right?
[10:49] <|rt|> Landon: check it's web page first to see if it's something you need....something in that list that variant just gave you may be somewhere in between
[10:49] <JohnM555> wweasel: yes, I am, whats repos?
[10:49] <Landon> |rt|: Thanks, I'll do that then
[10:49] <BadKitty> John, you shouldn't have to use ndiswrapper for edgy to use your card... I have the same one
[10:49] <BadKitty> I just had to enter my essid and the WEP key
[10:49] <JohnM555> BadKitty: you're kidding :\
[10:49] <BadKitty> Badda-Bing, Badda-Boom
[10:49] <lk11mn> psusi: i'ma reboot now, coz i'll prolly need to anyway (and reinstalling dmraid didnt go as plant - the installer is hung and i cant play with synaptic) so i'll brb
[10:50] <wweasel> BadKitty: I am not saying he has to, but it could well be easier
[10:50] <Skyrail> StarQuake: last time I upgraded the desktop wouldn't load, what would I do if this happen again?
[10:50] <wweasel> JohnM555: Almost all packages you will ever need will be in the official ubuntu repositories (repos). You can access them via Synaptic, or apt-get in the terminal
[10:50] <variant> Landon: you might want to check out rosegarden, its pretty advanced features
[10:50] <JohnM555> wweasel: but do I need to be on the internet for those to work?
[10:50] <CHR1Six> wweasel, don't forget to tell him to enable the universe repo then. :P
[10:50] <BadKitty> Wait, my card is a little different
[10:51] <JohnM555> universe repo?
[10:51] <wweasel> JohnM555: Right...need internet connection. Any chance you can plug in via ethernet?
[10:51] <BadKitty> But seriously I had so many problems with my linksys card, I got a netgear and it works just fine
[10:51] <mortal5> how do i make aptitude match whole words?
[10:51] <wweasel> CHR1Six: getting there :P
[10:51] <morphish> Johan666: uh, there should only one listed, the rest should say stuff like "eth0      no wireless extensions."
[10:51] <JohnM555> wweasel: no, thats why I need wireless. I'm on my laptop now
[10:51] <BadKitty> Cool: hmmmmm
[10:51] <CHR1Six> Ah, sorry to jump ahead. :)
[10:51] <BadKitty> I guess we register....
[10:51] <arthursc> hi can someone help me with adding the following line to rc.local so I can get my wifi LED working the line I need to add is  echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000:02:03.0/led but not sure where to add it.
[10:51] <JohnM555> morphish: let me check again
[10:51] <CHR1Six> So... is there anyone here that can help with a netinstall issue or not really? Sadly the ubuntu forums are lacking in this one too
[10:52] <morphish> arthurb: anywhere in rc.local
[10:52] <baastrup> hi, my laptop dies now and then, looks like a heating problem, its a intel centrino duo core 2, and the  gnome sensor applet says the the cpu is like 98 C
[10:52] <JohnM555> for eth2 it lists things, and for ath0 it lists things
[10:52] <arthursc> ok.
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-zzz
[10:52] <variant> arthursc: run that command dont add it to anything, the echo 1 > /path/to/file will "echo" the digit 1 in the the file
[10:52] <MrKeuner> hi, does anybody use mpd with ubuntu here?
[10:52] <baastrup> but my cpu fan issent doing anything
[10:52] <wweasel> JohnM555: Hmmm...well, you could probably get a network-manager deb to your main computer via USB Key or whatever, but that shouldn't be necessary. It should work without network-manager, it just simplifies things.
[10:53] <morphish> Johan666: do you have something in your pcmcia slot? and something built in?
[10:53] <JohnM555> I actually have two wireless cards, but with windows my netgear(actually a usb) gets better connection
[10:53] <MrKeuner> I cannot get my music directory read by mpd with ubuntu built binaries
[10:53] <JohnM555> I think the network-manager is what I need but I didnt find a deb for it
[10:53] <JohnM555> I just found a tar.gz
[10:53] <variant> arthursc: as an example, in gnome-terminal type echo "hello" and press return
[10:53] <Skyrail> StarQuake: ? I can't upgrade until I know waht I'm doing otherwise I'll mess it all up again
[10:53] <morphish> JohnM555: check dmesg which is which
[10:53] <BadKitty> yah download that john
[10:53] <cafuego_> JohnM555: network-manager-gnome is in ubuntu
[10:53] <MrKeuner> JohnM555: ddid you enable additional repositories universe and multiverse?
[10:53] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: ok, swicthed all sources.list entries to edgy and trying an upgrade - if it fails, i'll blame it all on you :)
[10:53] <cafuego_> don't be messing with tarballs
[10:53] <variant> arthursc: you can redirect the output to a file with the ">" symbol (its called greaterthan)
[10:53] <JohnM555> morphish: dmesg?
[10:53] <Cool> back
[10:54] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, Yep :)
[10:54] <rBlong2us> I get this error
[10:54] <JohnM555> Oh, and I have been transfering things via usb
[10:54] <morphish> Johan666: in your terminal type 'dmesg | more'

[10:54] <JohnM555> morphish: I did, it lists a lot of stuff
[10:55] <wweasel> morphish: Why do you use more instead of less?
[10:55] <gyaresu> !hi > T0aD
[10:55] <morphish> JohnM555: that should show what got found and what device it is hopefully
[10:55] <JohnM555> morphish: what exactly am I looking for?
[10:55] <T0aD> how do you make a ramdisk on a kernel < 2.6.15 ?
[10:55] <morphish> wweasel: *shrug* why not?
[10:55] <T0aD> mkinitramfs complains it want a kernel > 2.6.15 for udev
[10:55] <motin> gnome won't respond, so I am in text-mode using ircII here.
[10:55] <wweasel> lol :)
[10:55] <lalox> lol
[10:55] <motin> what do one do? cpu usage is not high - so gnome shouldnt be occupied - it just wont respond
[10:55] <variant> arthursc: in irc type va and press the tab key :)
[10:55] <tRSS>  i want to be able to connect to existing bash session. e.g. I want to be able to ssh into machine from a remote location and then somehow connect to my existing shell running locally to, may be, able to check status of yum? how do I do that?
[10:56] <gyaresu> T0aD, Any reason you can't get the latest kernel?
[10:56] <T0aD> gyaresu, i need a custom kernel
[10:56] <JohnM555> Its way too much stuff for me to look at when I don't know what I'm looking for
[10:56] <arthursc> va
[10:56] <T0aD> Im using a vanilla 2.6.12 kernel for some clustering software
[10:56] <variant> arthursc: lol
[10:56] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: err- 38 packages will be removed. These include eclipse,  kdelibs-bin, kubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-desktop, x-window-system-core, xserver-xorg.... can that be right? it sounds *very* scary.
[10:56] <variant> arthursc: what irc program are you using?
[10:56] <eidos> how do i make a binary file on linux clickable to run?  properties say it can be executed, and it looks like a gear
[10:56] <T0aD> problem is I have issues booting cause ramdisk aint good (im using LVM + RAID)
[10:56] <JohnM555> I'm going to look for a network-manager deb
[10:56] <morphish> T0aD:  Linux demogorgon 2.6.19-rc4-git12 #1 Wed Nov 8 02:10:33 CST 2006 i686 GNU/Linux w/o a initramfs/initrd though (the splash alone wasn't worth it)
[10:57] <motin> it is always like this - nobody responds because the message is drowned in all conversation
[10:57] <variant> eidos: then you should be able to click run it
[10:57] <arthursc> looking....
[10:57] <gyaresu> T0aD, has to be that version?
[10:57] <T0aD> yes :(
[10:57] <rBlong2us> to restart X should I ctrlaltback?
[10:57] <BadKitty> Hey Cool: Did you get your nick registered?
[10:57] <arthursc> gaim
[10:57] <eidos> a box opens up and it says Run With..
[10:57] <variant> arthursc: ok, in a terminal type "sudo gedit /etc/rc.local"
[10:57] <motin> is there any trick to get gnome to respond again?
[10:57] <Cool> How do i do that?
[10:57] <eidos> it's a compiled freebasic binary
[10:57] <BadKitty> type /msg NickServ REGISTER password
[10:57] <snook353> do i need to remove network manager to use netswitch?
[10:57] <mirak> fuck ati, I can't believe what they answered to my bug report on their website http://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&ticketID=1131314
[10:57] <eidos> i can run from the konsole ok

[10:58] <ubotu> mirak: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:58] <arthursc> ok rc.local loaded
[10:58] <motin> it is like one is invisible
[10:58] <variant> arthursc: scratch that, do this instead
[10:58] <arthursc> ok
[10:58] <nette> hey: can someone redirect me to a channel with linux games. i.e the game "Glest"?
[10:58] <BadKitty> Yah im pretty new too.. I just used looked it up
[10:58] <MrKeuner> !help
[10:58] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl  -  Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:58] <motin> what do one do? cpu usage is not high - so gnome shouldnt be occupied - it just wont respond
[10:58] <morphish> JohnM555: no idea, i am setting up my wifi with a little file i carried from gentoo over SourceMage to kubuntu, i just run that from rc.local
[10:58] <motin> is there any trick to get gnome to respond again?
[10:59] <eidos> mirak - wont let me see the response, have to be logged in as a user to see it
[10:59] <variant> arthursc: sudo gedit /etc/rc.local
[10:59] <JohnM555> That went right over my head :\
[10:59] <motin> it is always like this - nobody responds because the message is drowned in all conversation
[10:59] <morphish> mirak: can't see your ticket
[10:59] <mirak> LjL: *bip* ati *bip* ati bip *ati* , I think any children learn in school what to make fit in
[10:59] <mirak> lol
[10:59] <variant> arthursc: and put this line BEFORE the bit that says exit 0: echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000:02:03.0/led
[10:59] <snook353> is it ok to remove network manager?
[10:59] <mirak> ok I pastebin
[10:59] <StarQuake> Skyrail, hehe that might be a good idea
[10:59] <snook353> does it conflict with netswitch, or other network manager-like things?
[10:59] <CHR1Six> Does anyone here have experience with ubuntu net install ?
[11:00] <StarQuake> Skyrail, though i don't think there is a big chance you will mess things up
[11:00] <motin> too bad #ubuntu is so crowded - very few can get help
[11:00] <BadKitty> Anyone use beryl in here?
[11:00] <arthursc> done
[11:00] <Skyrail> StarQuake: last time I upgraded, I don't know if it was that or something else but when I loged on the screen was just the background nothing else started up
[11:00] <JohnM555> I found this site for the network-manager: http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/ but I can't find any devs, just the tar.gz
[11:00] <eidos> not really motin, i get help here all the time
[11:00] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell BadKitty about beryl
[11:00] <JohnM555> debs*
[11:00] <Duesentrieb> guys, is it normal that essential-looking packages like xserver-xorg are listed for removal when dist-upgrading to edgy?
[11:00] <eidos> i see 988 nicks :)
[11:00] <BadKitty> Im using Beryl....
[11:01] <BadKitty> Just wanted to see if anyone else was
[11:01] <variant> arthursc: ok, it should work now
[11:01] <morphish> JohnM555: network-manager-gnome - network management framework (GNOME frontend)  , someone told you that already
[11:01] <eidos> motin - u need help?
[11:01] <BadKitty> John, do you know what the tar.gz is?
[11:01] <mirak> eidos: morphish : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30684/
[11:01] <arthursc> do I need to reboot or restart desktop ?
[11:01] <variant> arthursc: Duesentrieb nope, thats a breakage
[11:01] <JohnM555> morphis: oh ok I'll look again
[11:01] <variant> arthursc: to make it happen automaticaly you would have to reboot but you can just echo it to the device your self
[11:02] <variant> arthursc: so you dont need to reboot
[11:02] <StarQuake> Skyrail, mmm okay... too bad
[11:02] <Duesentrieb> variant: hm? what he said or what I said?
[11:02] <variant> Duesentrieb: sorry, ment you only
[11:02] <eidos> i guess they're not in the open sourced business
[11:02] <variant> Duesentrieb: breakage
[11:02] <Duesentrieb> variant: that'S a *scary* breakage, then :(
[11:02] <JohnM555> These are the only downloads for it I can find
[11:02] <JohnM555> http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager/0.6/
[11:02] <CHR1Six> Hey, can anyone help me out for a few?
[11:02] <morphish> JohnM555: and it apt-cache does not list it or apt-get refuses to install it, make sure you check if you need to add universe or multivers to sources.list (i have no idea in which repo it is in)
[11:02] <dtorres> anyone know something better than rdesktop for terminal services
[11:03] <variant> Duesentrieb: yeah, if you uninstall and reinstall all those package it should go away
[11:03] <morphish> dtorres: to connect to windows? no
[11:03] <JohnM555> morphis: don't I need the internet to do that?
[11:03] <mwe> I want to access a host on a different subnet than my own. I can't ping it. Do I have to add an entry to the kernel routing table or what?
[11:03] <motin> eidos: yes well I needed help - now I restarted gdm and am restarting every program that was running - it was easier than trying to get help here on how to unfreeze gnome or look for material to bugreport
[11:03] <variant> !rdp
[11:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about rdp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:03] <motin> ciao
[11:03] <nette> hey: can someone redirect me to a channel with linux games. i.e the game "Glest"?
[11:03] <eidos> you know what.. if it weren't for the games available for the PC, I see no future for it - including Vista
[11:03] <CHR1Six> motin - use ctrl+alt+backspace to restart gnome :)
[11:03] <arthursc> ok Variant. Thanks will reboot to verify inless there is another way?
[11:03] <Duesentrieb> variant: i'm not going to uninstall kdelib :) anyway, a plain "upgrade" instead of "dist-upgrade" doesn't want to remove anything.
[11:03] <gyaresu> !offtopic > eidos  (busy enough here as it is)
[11:03] <BadKitty> Cool....
[11:04] <variant> arthursc: yes, you dont need to reboot
[11:04] <eidos> sorry
[11:04] <morphish> mirak: i think your chipset is no longer supported in ati drivers past 8.28.8 and you need to stick to 8.28.8
[11:04] <psusi> lk11mn: ok, new package uploaded
[11:04] <BadKitty> Cool: Are you registered yet?
[11:04] <gnomefreak> Duesentrieb: remove libqt3-mt if you no longer what kde
[11:04] <CHR1Six> hey - can anyone offer some help for a minute?
[11:04] <lk11mn> cool, thx psusi
[11:04] <variant> arthursc: just type: echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000:02:03.0/led
[11:04] <arthursc> wifi LED is still not lit?
[11:04] <variant> arthursc: as root
[11:04] <mirak> morphish: it's not true
[11:04] <gyaresu> CHR1Six, you're having the netinstall prob right?
[11:04] <CHR1Six> yeah.
[11:04] <kosnick> i need to connect my k750 mobile with kandy . what is the port i have to use?
[11:04] <Duesentrieb> variant: otoh, a normal upgrade only gives 158 packages to upgrade - instead of > 1000 with dist-upgrade.
[11:04] <variant> Duesentrieb: yeah
[11:04] <arthursc> I get permission denied!
[11:04] <james296> how can I install the new NVIDIA driver for Ubuntu? I mean, how can I exit the X session and be able to install it?
[11:04] <Duesentrieb> so, it seems nither works for me :(
[11:05] <Cool> hello
[11:05] <variant> arthursc: as root?
[11:05] <CHR1Six> i don't know if anyone here can help much, but if you hae any thoughts i would like to know them. :)
[11:05] <BadKitty> Cool: did you register?
[11:05] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, You have to 'update' then 'upgrade' then 'dist-upgrade'
[11:05] <variant> james296: type /etc/init.d/gdm stop in a terminal
[11:05] <arthursc> cho 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000:02:03.0/led
[11:05] <Cool> I cant
[11:05] <variant> james296: you can do that from inside gnome
[11:05] <BadKitty> James.. you can install it in the x session by opening up a terminal
[11:05] <variant> arthursc: echo
[11:05] <arthursc> bash: command not found
[11:05] <morphish> JohnM555: you have no ethernet in that thing? anyway so you have an eth? and ath0 just dhclient ath0, then wait and see if you get IP (presuming all your essid, key, channel and all was right for them) if nothing goes, try it for eth? one of them has to get an ip if your AP supports dhcp
[11:05] <dtorres> in rdesktop when i scroll through text i see doubles of every line
[11:05] <BadKitty> cool: Why not what does it say?
[11:05] <variant> arthursc: what?
[11:05] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: the update is already done - didn't know i need a normal upgrade before a dist-upgrade... seems a bit strange... but i'll try.
[11:05] <variant> arthursc: thats what happens when you do that?
[11:06] <james296> no, it tells me I need to be logged out of the x session
[11:06] <mirak> morphish: otherwise I couldn't get 3D on 8.30 drivers, but I get it. The problem is that I must disable the DRM_RADEON module, otherwise it doesn't work. It was the case even one year ago, and probably even before. you can find tons of people with radeon 9600 pro complaining about such a problem, of dri not working, but nobody seems to care
[11:06] <Duesentrieb> gyaresu: or should i use update-manager?
[11:06] <kosnick> i need to connect my mobile with kandy (=mobile application) . what port do i have to use?
[11:06] <JohnM555> um..
[11:06] <gyaresu> Duesentrieb, nah. manually is best.
[11:06] <BadKitty> james...hm...ok
[11:06] <T0aD> gyaresu, any hint ?
[11:06] <morphish> JohnM555: once you have internet, go and install that thing, or copy it onto something on the machine you irc from, and copy it back to the laptop, either way
[11:06] <gyaresu> T0aD, about what?
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
[11:06] <arthursc> LOL missed the E.... Working now great stuff many thanks...
[11:06] <mirak> morphish: and it's not even related to ubuntu, all users have this problem
[11:06] <variant> arthursc: no permission denied error?
[11:06] <variant> arthursc: good, is the light on?
[11:06] <gyaresu> T0aD, Recaps please...
[11:06] <morphish> mirak: i know it is not a ubuntu problem, what were you refering to as "not true" ?
[11:07] <variant> arthursc: chang ethat to a 0 to turn it back off again :P
[11:07] <arthursc> yep oh and ...what about blue tooth???
[11:07] <kosnick> kandy app : what port is my mobile ?
[11:07] <dtorres> whats the best samba gui client to connect to windows shares?
[11:07] <T0aD> how do you make a ramdisk on a kernel < 2.6.15 ?
[11:07] <BadKitty> Cool type this: /msg NickServ REGISTER password (but use your own  password instead of the word password)
[11:07] <j2daosh> ls
[11:07] <variant> arthursc: you could bind that to a key combo and use it for morse code signals ;)
[11:07] <variant> arthursc: what about bluetooth?
[11:07] <dtorres> anyone?
[11:07] <kosnick> ubuntu + mobiles ?
[11:07] <variant> arthursc: i have never used bluetooth tbh, so i have no idea about it
[11:08] <gyaresu> dtorres, imho smb4k
[11:08] <LjL> variant: .-. . .- .-.. .-.. -.-- ?

Now when I run configure it says c compiler cannot create executables and dies.  What do I need to do to get a suitable build environment?
[11:08] <marshall> does anybody know where i can get a silc account?
[11:08] <psusi> lk11mn: you got that going yet?

[11:08] <variant> LjL: ah sorry hahahaha
[11:08] <LjL> variant: i asked "really?" :-P
[11:08] <dtorres> im actually using kde :)

[11:09] <Weed_Man> Hi! I'm using Edgy 6.10 for AMD64, but the bcm43xx driver for Braodcom 4318 wireless is working bad (it loses connection after a while). The developers recommended I upgrade the kernel to 2.6.18, but there seems like there are no Ubuntu versions for that kernel. Any suggestions?
[11:09] <JohnM555> neither dhclient ath0 or eth0 worked
[11:09] <st4hl> i couldnt find it for some reason thought it was something else
[11:09] <variant> st4hl: /etc/motd
[11:09] <st4hl> yah thanks guys
[11:09] <variant> st4hl: slocate motd
[11:09] <variant> st4hl: slocate is your friend
[11:09] <JohnM555> I don't have ehternet, if I did I wouldn't need wireless
[11:09] <kefah> Hi, I'm looking for a decent review comparing ubuntu to fc6
[11:10] <variant> kefah: google
[11:10] <st4hl> lol i need to install slocate :P
[11:10] <dnite> is there a way to get vlc or totem to work with wmv streams ??
[11:10] <variant> kefah: google ubuntu vs fc6
[11:10] <kamui> psusi: thanks big time
[11:10] <variant> st4hl: no, it comes with it
[11:10] <kamui> :)
[11:10] <gyaresu> kefah, ^^
[11:10] <JohnM555> I know I've got to be doing something stupid...it shouldn't be this hard to get wireless working
[11:10] <kefah> variant, I know I did that. The thing is I want something that I can trust.
[11:10] <st4hl> i dont have it
[11:10] <variant> st4hl: run updatedb
[11:10] <lk11mn> psusi: after installing it, it has the 2 raw raids in mapper
[11:10] <Weed_Man> anyone upgraded edgy to 2.6.18?
[11:10] <morphish> mirak: hm 9600 seems to be in 8.30.x *shrug*
[11:10] <variant> st4hl: it comes with ubuntu so i can't imagine that you dont
[11:10] <psusi> klajrhgjkl345?!

[11:11] <psusi> I am a retard
[11:11] <st4hl> 6.10 lamp didn't have it installed
[11:11] <psusi> stupid typo... trying again
[11:11] <lk11mn> psusi: and i tried dmraid -an, and i get an ERROR opening "/dev/isw_hebacbgjj_DATA"
[11:11] <kosnick> anyone ever used "KANDY"?
[11:11] <variant> st4hl: how stupid, its an essential package. ubuntu's command line support is laughable
[11:11] <JohnM555> I have no idea what I'm doing
[11:12] <st4hl> mmm i installed it and now i get

[11:12] <st4hl> slocate: fatal error: Could not find user database '/var/lib/slocate/slocate.db':  No such file or directory

[11:12] <st4hl> so i do updatedb
[11:12] <variant> st4hl: yeah, as i say. run updatedb as root
[11:12] <kosnick> anyone ever used "kandy"?
[11:12] <st4hl> yeah cool it works
[11:12] <Weed_Man> If I compile a vanilla kernel, will I lose all Ubuntu goodies?
[11:13] <st4hl> thanks a bunch man
[11:13] <variant> st4hl: yw
[11:13] <FlyingSquirrel32> I the previous version of ubuntu I could go to System> Drives or something like that and mount drives and stuff. Is there any replacement for this?
[11:13] <Amaranth> FlyingSquirrel32: No, it was removed from GNOME (and thus Ubuntu) because it was really buggy.
[11:13] <variant> st4hl: remember that if your looking for a file that has recently been added you have to updatedb first (it is run as a cron job every day though)
[11:14] <FlyingSquirrel32> is there any gui way to mount drives now?
[11:14] <mirak> morphish: all cards are supported from 8500 at least
[11:14] <st4hl> nod 'll add it to cron
[11:14] <variant> st4hl: and you cant use it to find files that the user running it doesnt have permission to read
[11:14] <snook353> for any newbies wondering, this is my answer to removing network-manager:  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=113715
[11:14] <variant> st4hl: iirc, the installation hsould set up a cron job but check anyway
[11:14] <st4hl> how would i check this?
[11:14] <st4hl> cron.daily?
[11:15] <variant> st4hl: check roots crontab
[11:15] <variant> st4hl: yeah
[11:15] <morphish> mirak: on 8.29.x i read the release notes and it mentioned that support was drpped and to use 8.28.8 for those, maybe someone goofed on the site redesign
[11:15] <gyaresu> st4hl, 'sudo crontab -l'
[11:15] <psusi> lk11mn: ok... reboot one more time and this time I should have it ;)
[11:15] <st4hl> yeah its been added to /etc/cron.daily
[11:15] <st4hl> nod, thanks again guys =)
[11:15] <variant> st4hl: cool
[11:15] <mirak> morphish: I added that maybe he believed I wasn't talking of fglrx
[11:15] <lk11mn> lol yay
[11:15] <james296> how come when I exit the X session its just a cursor thing and I type and nothing happens?
[11:15] <morphish> mirak: perhaps it said 9250 and below though
[11:16] <mirak> morphish: probably he tough I wasn't talking of their own driver. I wouldn't have posted there anyway
[11:16] <morphish> mirak: but yes, the answer does look like he was not talking about fglrx at all, since they should know their own driver
[11:16] <Ballex> goran?
[11:16] <mirak> morphish: I am 100% sure it's supported, but there is a bug for this card
[11:16] <JohnM555> Why does so much of this for setting up wireless expect people to have internet access, when they need wireless to get to the internet?
[11:16] <rzoad> ja
[11:17] <mirak> morphish: yes I answered something like that. that I was a bit surprise they don't know they have a linux driver called fglrx ^^
[11:17] <LjL> JohnM555: because we don't have a better option right now.
[11:17] <Zeike> I'm installing 6.10 from CD and the install fails at 71% every time. Interface is frozen except for mouse. Anyone seen that? Any way for me to see what's going on? verbose install or something?
[11:17] <JohnM555> Ok
[11:17] <morphish> JohnM555: because you have the tools to do it manually, and most people plug in an ethernet cable for the install and then never again, after the install is done
[11:17] <variant> JohnM555: yes, its a very annoying situation. caused entirely by the hardware manufacturers, it will probably be annohter year before it's surpased the ease with which windows users handle wifi
[11:17] <james296> well?
[11:17] <gyaresu> Zeike, Possibly error on cd/ cdrom bad laser/ dodgy ram
[11:18] <JohnM555> I don't understand why they would use wireless if they had an ethernet cable
[11:18] <variant> JohnM555: laptops
[11:18] <grndslm> any advice for a "good value" linux-compatible scanner?
[11:18] <Ballex> Im a noob, can i get some help?
[11:18] <JohnM555> But don't most people use desktops?
[11:18] <gyaresu> !helpme > Ballex
[11:18] <Ballex> hu?
[11:18] <gyaresu> JohnM555, No.
[11:18] <variant> JohnM555: what diference does that make?
[11:18] <morphish> JohnM555: because it is there before wifi, any cd boots and eth0 grabs an IP, long before wifi needs YOUR WEP info
[11:18] <codeyman> grndslm,HP
[11:19] <JohnM555> Alright...whatever

[11:19] <shrndegruv> guys how do i tell which ati driver i am using?
[11:19] <codeyman> well most of them do
[11:19] <variant> JohnM555: i am typeing this on a laptop, how many business men have you seen take a desktop pc to a meeting or conference? (none)
[11:19] <JohnM555> Oh, I'm not saying nobody uses laptops

[11:20] <Ballex> i get a message about som graphic X or something
[11:20] <JohnM555> variant: I'm just saying I think a lot of people using Ubuntu would use it on a desktop, thats all

[11:20] <MugginsM> I'm unsure why you'd use wireless on a desktop when wired is faster
[11:20] <Infecto> hi
[11:20] <MugginsM> and it has to have power cables anyway
[11:20] <variant> JohnM555: if you like, but i dont see what difference it makes as to whether or not you use ubuntu if you have a desktop or a laptop
[11:20] <gyaresu> !offtopic > JohnM555
[11:20] <crass> JohnM555: I think ubuntu is great for laptops, its hibernate support is pretty good
[11:20] <Infecto> maybe someone run fingerprint ?
[11:21] <morphish> JohnM555: i always wire my laptop for installs, it is too annoying having to wait for an IP till i fired up my wifi, i take my tie, set it all up, then unplug it when i am done, one time deal, and also avoids my neighbor's AP going haywire causing my AP to drop me
[11:21] <shrndegruv> dont see a driver version in glxinfo
[11:21] <shrndegruv> xorg.conf says ati
[11:21] <shrndegruv> is that open source
[11:21] <shrndegruv> ?
[11:21] <morphish> shrndegruv: that is OSS, yes
[11:21] <Ballex> what may the problem be?
[11:21] <fabio__> does someone have the link to the ubuntu wiki where there is the suggested sources.list ? thanks

[11:54] <TheGateKeeper> SleepySocks: good luck :-)
[11:55] <psusi> lk11mn: if you go that route, you will need to modify /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/dmraid to add the -fsil flag you had to use before
[11:56] <psusi> lk11mn: in fact... why don't you try that again real quick with that flag
[11:56] <psusi> lk11mn: it may just have a problem with your isw raid
[11:56] <psusi> and bails out
[11:56] <nko> someone can help me?
[11:56] <shrndegruv> where do i get gkrellm skins?

[11:57] <psusi> lk11mn: yea, but if they aren't on, then there is no use turning them off ;)
