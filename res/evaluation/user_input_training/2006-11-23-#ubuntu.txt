[12:00] <Kijutsu> Doesn't do DVDs does it?
[12:01] <azcazandco> so I figured I could reshuffle my os's by doing the following: 1) install win2k for gaming on hda1 2) install a new dapper on sda 3) copy firefox stuff and thunderbird stuff + files from old install on sdb and hopefully have a fresh system to work with
[12:01] <Kijutsu> mat1, i've used three different distros now, and they all have the annoying half-screen blue vertical bar during DVD playback.
[12:01] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: does that sound like a bad way to do things?
[12:02] <Ge33k> hi
[12:02] <stalefries> azcazandco: look into Google's Browser Sync extension
[12:02] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: it a way. i cant say good or bad but if you dont know what causes it than your avoiding it not fixing it and can happen again
[12:02] <confusco> anybody have an idea why my game is slow? I've installed the drivers correctly, and have direct rendering, but it's a lot slower than in Windows
[12:02] <stalefries> !hi | Ge33k
[12:02] <ubotu> Ge33k: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[12:02] <stalefries> :)
[12:02] <Ge33k> :)
[12:02] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: I did go kinda crazy messing with things
[12:03] <azcazandco> so if I was to try and debug things with my install where would I start?
[12:03] <azcazandco> I would be happy to just get this one working
[12:03] <azcazandco> currently running a web updated dapper to edgy
[12:03] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: get rid of any xgl/compiz/beryl packages that you installed
[12:03] <azcazandco> gnome runs fine but no 3d
[12:04] <mattt_> anyone find firefox on 6.10 to be highly unstable?
[12:04] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: how?
[12:04] <mattt_> maybe it's just ppc
[12:04] <skizm> it seems to work okay for me, i haven't tested it a lot but it hasn't crashed or anything
[12:04] <sgirc> hi all
[12:04] <azcazandco> i would rather fix it than migrate
[12:04] <mattt_> skizm: mine crashes all the time, when i'm doing the most arbitrary things
[12:04] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: sudo apt-get remove --purge  and list the packages you installed for xgl/comp/beryl
[12:05] <pyro> hi guys
[12:05] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: hint look at the guide you used to install it
[12:05] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: I followed tutorials and copied pasted, couldnt even name the tutorials
[12:05] <grimboy> Is pcf font support being deprecated in ubuntu because it seems pretty dire.
[12:05] <azcazandco> was a while ago now
[12:05] <grimboy> ?
[12:05] <azcazandco> gnome runs fine and I can do all my dev work
[12:05] <azcazandco> but I just know deep down I broke something
[12:06] <azcazandco> was gonna try and start from scratch and be careful
[12:06] <grimboy> azcazandco, Ooh, I hate that feeling, slightly sickening.
[12:06] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: might be better off your way than because you need to know what scripts you made what you added to scripts already there packages you installed and so on
[12:06] <azcazandco> get things working then stop messing
[12:06] <LaserLine> Anybody know how I can fix my webcam.  It worked fine under dapper, but I did a fresh install of Edgy and all i see is a grey screen now.  The light is on and everything and the mic works fine with it.  It's a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000
[12:06] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: I am a little concerned about the migration

[12:07] <azcazandco> but I am willing to give it a go which is why i was starting with a win2k on it's own partition
[12:07] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: if your using apt its gonna break
[12:07] <bhudda> what does this mean? "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display "localhost:1.0".

[12:07] <Ge33k> i install php5 then i write in the shell " php " out >  bash: php: command not found ?? why
[12:07] <grimboy> (I think I broke punctuation)
[12:07] <gnomefreak> bhudda: ati?
[12:07] <azcazandco> I used apt following commands

=== Trotsky is now known as Olipro
[12:08] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: was one of them sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[12:08] <bhudda> I spent that many hours messing with wine, and get that result. That absolutely is horrid
[12:08] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: or did you gksudo update-manager -c?
[12:08] <Hazart> Ge33k: apt-get install php5-cli
[12:08] <Lobo_> hi
[12:08] <Ge33k> good
[12:09] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: probably at some point
[12:09] <Ge33k> i now install it :)
[12:09] <azcazandco> have definitely done sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:09] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: i mean to upgrade from dapper to edgy
[12:09] <azcazandco> yes
[12:09] <gnomefreak> or did you not do that
[12:09] <azcazandco> I run edgy now
[12:09] <gnomefreak> ah
[12:09] <azcazandco> but did the dist update
[12:09] <Lobo_> in xorg.conf, is horizsync "31.5 - 100" valid ? or should i put 31 or 32 or 31,5 ?
[12:10] <Kingsqueak> Lobo_: depends on your monitor specs
[12:10] <iratik_> I've plugged a USB external media drive , ubuntu edgy recognized it - however, its in the file system as "/media/Mass storage" is there any way to name it something without a space in it?
[12:10] <azcazandco> I wanna go back to dapper and treat it with respect
[12:10] <bhudda> Why!! Oh what a cruel world we live in...hey gnomefreak, has there been anything written on this issue?
[12:10] <azcazandco> I want4ed to try 64bit but decided I just need to go dapper 32 till I understand things a bit better
[12:10] <gnomefreak> bhudda: i dont remember
[12:10] <Ge33k> thnnnx more , now it's work good Hazart
[12:10] <bhudda> dang
[12:10] <azcazandco> been running ubuntu for about 5mths now and love it
[12:11] <Hazart> Ge33k: No problem
[12:11] <azcazandco> just have *glitches* I want to resolve
[12:11] <Lobo_> Kingsqueak, it's a videoprojector, its caracteristics are 31.5 - 100, is a dot valid in horizsync ?
[12:11] <azcazandco> or a start from scratch with a win2k for gaming
[12:11] <bhudda> azcazandco been a few days for me, and I love it too! 6.10 was a breeze to install, and the community here is so willing to help

[12:12] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: back to my 1, 2 ,3 ... is that the order I should do things?
[12:12] <gnomefreak> yes
[12:12] <Lobo_> does anyone know if a dot is valid in xorg.conf/horizsync ?
[12:13] <azcazandco> I basically have ubuntu on a 200gb sata drive, have one spare for my new install, I then have 2 x 250 gb ide drives
[12:13] <iratik_> Perhaps if I rephrase. The auto mounting in Ubuntu Edgy automatically names a certain external drive as "Mass storage" , it does so such that when I reference the file system path to the drive, I must enclose it in quotes e.g. cd "/media/Mass storage" - How do i configure the name so that it doesnt use spaces?
[12:13] <azcazandco> want to put win2k on hda1 and use hdb for backing up settings etc

[12:14] <SurfnKid> how do ya write a rename script?

[12:15] <iratik_> SurfnKid: echo 'mv someexistingfilename  somerenamedfilename' > myscript.sh
[12:15] <LjL> or "man rename" even
[12:15] <iratik_> SrufnKid: chmod +x myscript.sh
[12:15] <SurfnKid> wha about a batch if i have 100 files to rename
[12:15] <LjL> SurfnKid: "rename" can do that. "man rename"
[12:15] <SurfnKid> LjL, coolers
[12:15] <SurfnKid> thx
[12:15] <SurfnKid> iratik, thx
[12:16] <luca> quickcam pro?
[12:16] <luca> sorry, reading from above
[12:16] <luca> LaserLine: quickcam pro?
[12:16] <luca> were you actually able to make it function under Dapper?
[12:16] <iratik_> Anyway, How do you manually set the name given to an automatically named device. The name ubuntu edgy gave my device "Mass storage" I can't really use, because then I have to reference it like "/media/Mass storage" (in quotes). Does anyone know what i'm talking about?
[12:17] <azcazandco> gnomefreak: I cannot bork the mbr on my sata drive doing all of this can i?  My one saving grace has been that I can change the boot order in the bios and it keeps coming back to this install
[12:17] <bense> does anyone know anything about those IDE - SATA dongles?
[12:17] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: if you can, just format it again with mkfs and use the -L for labeling it
[12:17] <gnomefreak> azcazandco: reinstalling its a good idea to write new mbr (installer does that for you
[12:18] <iratik_> so .... unmount, then   'man mkfs' ?
[12:18] <soulfire41> Hey, if i have the Ubuntu server install, can i get a shell with that and install gnome myself to give myself the desktop?
[12:18] <LaserLine> luca "yeah, it just worked" under dapper, but yeah it's a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000
[12:18] <azcazandco> so it'll write the mbr to the new sata?
[12:18] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: what fs are you using on it?
[12:18] <luca> LaserLine: what driver did you use?
[12:18] <bense> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812206001
[12:18] <bense> like that
[12:18] <azcazandco> so effectively I will have one on my old and one on my new?
[12:18] <iratik_> Kingsqueak: Its an external USB hard drive, It just automatically 'works', it appears on the screen at the root of the drive
[12:18] <azcazandco> if all installs are on separate drives?
[12:18] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: do you need it to work in Windows?
[12:19] <luca> LaserLine: out of curiosity because I am not able to use mine, which uses a Pixart Imaging chipset
[12:19] <iratik_> I haven't configured it or anything, and the plug n play works great except it automatically is named 'Mass storage'
[12:19] <iratik_> I'm not trying to format the usb hard drive
[12:19] <bense> guess that's a no
[12:19] <m0dY> how to set the date in my linux? not the time
[12:19] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: well to fix the name you have to
[12:19] <azcazandco> wish me luck
[12:19] <LaserLine> luca I wish i could be more helpful, but all I did under dapper was plug it in and it worked and all I did was plug it in edgy and it only somewhat works...and by that i mean the mic works and the light goes on when it wants to use the camera just a grey screen
[12:19] <iratik_> I'm not trying to do anything difficult here, i just want to rename "/media/Mass storage" to "/media/Mass_storage"
[12:19] <Innoruuk> Has anyone gotten quake 1 to remember the in-game settings?
[12:19] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: that's the volume label
[12:20] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: it autodetects the label on the drive and mounts it
[12:20] <iratik_> Yepp, the volume label - how do I alter the volume label ?
[12:20] <CyDrive> is there anyway to get the emerge pacage manager to work in ubuntu?
[12:20] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: it involves formatting that drive, that's what I'm getting at
[12:20] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: you set the volume label in the options when you create the filesystem on it
[12:20] <iratik_> omg , there is no way to create an alias or something?
[12:21] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: well if you override the auto mounting, you can mount it to whatever you want
[12:21] <iratik_> like ln -s "/media/Mass storage" ~/MassStorage
[12:21] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: the auto mounting will always name it that way otherwise
[12:21] <iratik_> Where are the configs for the auto mounting
[12:22] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: actually you could do that, the symlink
[12:22] <simon360> is there an easy way to install Ubuntu on Intel Macs yet?
[12:22] <m0dY> how to set the date in ubuntu? not the time!
[12:23] <iratik_> Kingsquek ,ahh , so I already knew how to do it
[12:23] <iratik_> thanks
[12:23] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: yup ;-)
[12:23] <iratik_> now if I can just get that symlink to be visible on the public web server
[12:23] <iratik_> i'm trying to make this usb hard drive completely visible from the internet
[12:24] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: a tip though, if you do just format that drive, you can mount it via the LABEL you give it and it's very convenient for removable storage devices as their dev names can change
[12:24] <jramsey> just enabled multiverse in sources.list; how do i get the repo updated?
[12:24] <Kingsqueak> iratik_: formatting won't break the nice automatic'ness of it either

[12:34] <jramsey> any takers on my java prob?
[12:34] <Skwid_> apokryphos: what's your favorite ? :)
[12:35] <iratik_> where is the configuration file for sshd ?
[12:35] <enyc> I am finding that mkisogs _NO LONGER_ makes ISO9660-compliant filename -- e.g. I am trying to create a CD image that is entirely DOS-compatible without -relaxed-filenames -- this _works_ in dapper/previous  but in edgy the mkisogs mucks up and puts in miked-case names etc.
[12:35] <SurfnKid> LjL, i took a look at man rename but it only renames files from capital to non capital etc or extension wise
[12:35] <enyc> kitche: apologies, see above
[12:35] <apokryphos> Skwid_: Amarok for sure. But Banshee isn't **that** bad an alternative if you have to use GTK
[12:35] <LjL> SurfnKid: no, not really. it can take any regular expression.
[12:35] <kitche> jramsey: did you install java? sicne ubuntu uses gcj instead
[12:35] <apokryphos> Skwid_: I can't live well without a nice collection, queing songs, and general kde configurability that Amarok offers though =)
[12:35] <SurfnKid> im trying to rename files i.e  dsc00001 to dsc10001  changigntt the first 1 in a batch
[12:35] <enyc>  kitche note that this even happens if I explicitly specify ISO level 1)
[12:35] <FFForever> how do i install flash for firefox?
[12:36] <pyro> where do i edit my mount points? /etc/fstab looks wierd.. well.. when you've used rehdat/fedora most of ur life
[12:36] <SurfnKid> ah ok
[12:36] <Skwid_> apokryphos: i see, i like all the context features, like lyrics, wikipedia info etc
[12:36] <SurfnKid> LjL, wish there was a website
[12:36] <jramsey> kitche, yes; apt-get install sun-java5-bin; is this incorrect for ubuntu?

[12:36] <enyc> kitche: I have successfully worked aroutd this by using the mkisofs binary from dapper! but Im sure something is wrong...
[12:36] <SurfnKid> so i could rename a whole batch name of files, im not much into programming, except on DOS, but not on it anymore ! lol
[12:36] <LjL> SurfnKid: there is. "man regex" and "man sed" are there also
[12:37] <SurfnKid> oh didnt know
[12:37] <SurfnKid> ok
[12:37] <felixjet> hi
[12:37] <kitche> jramsey: yes but did you make it your default java provider?
[12:37] <jramsey> kitche, i have no idea how to do that so i suppose i didn't
[12:37] <kitche> enyc: hmm I don't have problems with mkisofs on edgy but hten again I don't use many switches to do it
[12:37] <felixjet> correct me if im wrong... metacity is a window manager, like beryl. and XGL is a 3d for beryl. right?
[12:38] <enyc> kitche: the problem can be shown when not using any switches really
[12:38] <squeee> I have a mythtv box that requires noapic to be enabled, but I'm getting some problems with stability and really need it enabled.  Is there anyway I can get this working? (2.6.19/18 kernel or something)
[12:38] <kitche> jramsey: you have to use the update-alternative --java command there is more on ubuntu's site about it
[12:39] <bimberi> felixjet: yes, metacity.  no, xgl is an X server
[12:39] <enyc> kitche: e.g.  mkisofs input/ > output.iso   -- and it will NOT be iso-level-1 uppercase-only etc. -- it will not read properly in DOS and stuff....
[12:39] <protolnx> what's a one liner for mount in order to have a flash driver mounted with user permissions? I can't copy I can't write nor delete....
[12:39] <enyc> kitche: but it works properly in dapper version!
[12:40] <LjL> SurfnKid: rename "s/dsc.(....\.png)/dsc1\1/" *     might work, though no guarantees - test it in a backup directory first
[12:40] <enyc> hrrm
[12:41] <mat1> any one know why my intel video card is giving me no gart memery?
[12:41] <jramsey> kitche, i dont think i have multiverse set right in sources.list; i am checking now
[12:41] <enyc> kitche: bah! there _is_ already a bugreport about this!
[12:41] <felixjet> bimberi: but compiz, beryl and metacity are all windows mangers for X ?
[12:41] <SurfnKid> LjL,  ok thanks will check,
[12:41] <SurfnKid> :)
[12:41] <bimberi> felixjet: yes
[12:43] <felixjet> bimberi: its because im bored of metacity and i cant get running the murrine themes xD compiz o beryl (without XGL) are fast and stable as metacity? or not worth

[12:44] <chaelot|home> i just installed ubuntu on my dell inspiron 9300 laptop, and sound playback sounds strange (?)... for some reason it sounds like it's playing sounds out of a tin can
[12:44] <bimberi> felixjet: idk sorry, i've only played briefly with compiz/beryl and neither was stable
[12:45] <jramsey> kitche, i am using ubuntu 5.1; should i upgrade?
[12:45] <LjL> jramsey: probably
[12:45] <bimberi> ergo, dell == tin can :)
=== kud0s is now known as kud0s|sleeping
[12:46] <chaelot|home> bimberi: hehe, well, i am new to all of this :) just wondering if it's using wrong setup or something as it does sounds quite a lot better in Windows :)
[12:46] <mat1> LjL, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33243/ can u see why my video card not loading beryl?
[12:46] <astronouth7303> I have a saitek gamer's keyboard. (USB) It works fine as a basic keyboard and is recognized perfectly by ubuntu. I want to know how I can use the extra control "pod"
[12:46] <LjL> mat1: i never used beryl, and #ubuntu-xgl is the channel for beryl/compiz/xgl/aiglx help
[12:46] <mat1> i'm banned from there:(
[12:47] <chaelot|home> LjL: does there exist such a channel for people with sounds problems :) ?
[12:47] <LjL> do i look like an information point?
[12:48] <LjL> !sound
[12:48] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[12:48] <chaelot|home> thanks :)
[12:48] <graham> ndiswrapper help needed
[12:48] <chaelot|home> LjL: sorry to be a pester, just wanted someone to point me in the right direction :)
[12:48] <graham> i am on ubuntu 6.06
[12:48] <graham> benn at this all night :(
[12:49] <Luci3n> graham whats the problem
[12:49] <mat1> yea well i'm banned from ubuntu-xgl
[12:49] <graham> i cant seem to do anything with it
[12:49] <graham> seems not to be working
[12:49] <Keyseir> I repeatedly have "Segmentation fault" and "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" when running firefox. Sometimes restarting will solve the problem, other times I'll reinstall and it'll work fine for another few days. Does anyone have any ideas why I may be having these problems with FF? Running edgy.
[12:50] <graham> what i need is a linux for dumb nuts edition lol
[12:50] <bimberi> !fffc | Keyseir
[12:50] <ubotu> Keyseir: If Firefox is crashing on sites using Flash try adding "export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1" to /etc/firefox/firefoxrc (ref: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 )
[12:50] <holycow> Keyseir, what ubuntu release, 64 bit or 32 bit?
[12:50] <graham> help help help :( lol
[12:50] <Luci3n> graham have you got any gui to help you detect the network?
[12:50] <holycow> custom firefox build or from package install?
[12:50] <graham> umm i dont know whats that??
[12:51] <mat1> :@
[12:51] <graham> i am really a linux virgin you see i was on xp for a long time
[12:51] <Luci3n> have yoiu installed from synaptic an app to help you identify the network
[12:51] <Keyseir> holycow, How do I check that?
=== kuja_ is now known as kuja
[12:52] <Keyseir> holycow, I installed from the desktop cd
[12:52] <graham> wouldn't know where to start with that so prob not
[12:52] <graham> and all this is to get a wireless card to work
[12:52] <SurfnKid> LjL,  rename "s/dsc.(....\.png)/dsc1\1/" *   worked great
[12:52] <Luci3n> graham have you follwoed the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[12:52] <SurfnKid> LjL, just changed the png to jpg extension
[12:52] <SurfnKid> thanks!
[12:52] <LjL> SurfnKid: nice
[12:53] <Luci3n> it's pretty simple
[12:53] <LjL> SurfnKid: oh, right, i forgot the png thing, i was just trying a random extension =)
[12:53] <SurfnKid> could i do that as a script like  runren.sh?
[12:53] <graham> been on that page can't make sense of it and tried most suggestions on there
[12:53] <SurfnKid> yeah changed it, figured that was it
[12:53] <graham> i need lots of assistance with the whole thing
[12:53] <mat1> ARRRGGGG
[12:53] <SurfnKid> i have it set up on windows xp as ren.bat but the programming aint the same
[12:54] <holycow> sorry back
[12:54] <graham> do appologise for being annoying
[12:54] <holycow> Keyseir, when did you download the installer?
[12:54] <mat1> omg
[12:55] <Keyseir> holycow, I installed through apt-get.
[12:55] <eugman> When I try to watch an avi file with totem the picture blanks out almost immediately. When I try to watch with mplayer it complains about not being compiled with mp3lib. What can I do?
[12:55] <Luci3n> graham iknow th feeling
[12:55] <Luci3n> try here http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=527919a42c5acdf1b1f5eea4d17bac64&t=31926
[12:55] <Keyseir> holycow, I also uninstalled and installed again with apt-get or aptitude once, and now i'm having the problem again.
[12:55] <holycow> Keyseir, you mean you upgraded to the latest ubuntu using apt-get dist-upgrade?
[12:55] <graham> can you help me with this??
[12:55] <Keyseir> holycow,  No. I'm talking about firefox.
[12:55] <Keyseir> holycow, I installed Ubuntu Edgy Eft through the desktop cd.
[12:55] <SurfnKid> LjL, copy that line to a new file and name it *.sh and chmod it to what?
[12:55] <Luci3n> yes i have installed it on a number of my machine here
[12:56] <Keyseir> holycow, Clean.
[12:56] <LjL> SurfnKid: uhm? you still want to make a script?
[12:56] <Luci3n> graham what have you done so far
[12:56] <holycow> Keyseir, thats what i was wondering, okay.
[12:56] <SurfnKid> sorry yeah
[12:56] <mat1> omg can any one help me on my video card issue
[12:56] <SurfnKid> with that same stuff i guess
[12:56] <holycow> Keyseir, what plugins do you have for it and what extensions do you have?
[12:56] <SurfnKid> so it runs auotmatically
[12:56] <LjL> SurfnKid: you don't need to rename it. you need to put     #! /bin/sh   on the first line, and to chmod +x
[12:56] <holycow> i had the same thing on 2.0 ff on edgy with my stumble extension
[12:56] <SurfnKid> ah ok
[12:56] <Keyseir> holycow, Nothing that isn't default.
[12:56] <SurfnKid> let me write this down
[12:57] <holycow> i had to remove it manually and restore it
[12:57] <holycow> oh really?
[12:57] <graham> umm messed the whole thing up i think! tried installing ndiswrapper and didn't seem to work at all kept saying some kind of error
[12:57] <Luci3n> graham do you remember what error
[12:57] <eugman> Whta's the issue matl?
[12:57] <mat1> hello?>
[12:57] <holycow> Keyseir, okay have you tried deleting .mozilla from your home directory and restarting ff?
[12:57] <graham> hang on i will tell you
[12:57] <chaelot|home> hmmok, now i have enable the ALSA mixer and unmuted everything, still got sound, but the playback sounds very "thin" and sparkles often
[12:58] <chaelot|home> anyone know what that might be ?
[12:58] <Keyseir> nou, I'll try that.
[12:58] <Keyseir> holycow, Will renaming it work? ;-)
[12:58] <holycow> thats the same thing yes
[12:58] <mat1> my intel video card wont use my ram as memory
[12:58] <LjL> SurfnKid: generally speaking, if the first line of a file (we call it A) begins with #! followed by a filename (call this B), the shell tries to run B as a command, passing A as an argument. so, for shell scripts, you want B to be a shell (/bin/sh)
[12:58] <graham> tar: ndiswrapper: Cannot open: No such file or directory
[12:58] <graham> tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
[12:58] <graham> tar: Child returned status 2
[12:58] <graham> tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
[12:58] <graham> that error
[12:58] <holycow> okay so question for non noobs ... do we like or hate nforce drivers on linux?  nvidia seems to have binary drivers available, just curious if there are any known issues and such?
[12:59] <SurfnKid> LjL, i see
[12:59] <SurfnKid> let me write that down too lol
[12:59] <LjL> graham: you were already told to use the pastebin for long pastes. you're on mute for 10 minutes now
[01:00] <Luci3n> LjL that's rather harsh
[01:00] <chaelot|home> okok, learn by doing ---> google is my friend :)
[01:00] <kitche> holycow: most people just use AC97 drivers for them
[01:00] <eugman> matl, Hmmm. I'm afraid I don't know how to solve that one. If you can't get help here check the forums and the wiki. Someone is olikely to have had the same problem.
[01:00] <LjL> Luci3n, it's not like he wasn't warned.
[01:00] <Keyseir> holycow, Still getting a core dump
[01:00] <holycow> kitche, allrightty
[01:00] <Terminus> holycow: i'm on a nforce2 mobo right now and i never needed to install the nforce drivers. granted, i did disable the audio and ethernet because i wanted to use my own stuff...
[01:01] <mat1> beryl wont run becuase of my intel card
[01:01] <holycow> Keyseir, okay for that i would fill out the bugtracker thing that you might get ... for now try to download and use either mozilla, epiphany, opera or konqueror for web browsing
[01:01] <denys> anybody was able to install spoofstick extension on firefox 2.0 under edgy?
[01:01] <ArrenLex> mat1: I can't imagine that's the reason... my ATI card only gets 80fps with glxgears because the driver is so bad, but beryl still ran fine. You cannot possibly do worse and still have hardware acceleration at all.
[01:01] <holycow> Keyseir, i'm sorry but the standard regular configuration level fixes don't seem to be working for you, sounds like a bigger issue
[01:02] <holycow> Terminus, neato, thx for the heads up, appreciate that
[01:02] <Apex> Does anyone why system sounds would not be working through digital spdif when mp3 play and sounds at the login screen play?
[01:02] <eugman> matl, I know you can install binary drivers for nvidia and ati but I don't know about intel I'm afraid.
[01:02] <mat1> gart memory is not even here...
[01:02] <Keyseir> holycow, Thanks for your assistance
[01:02] <holycow> Keyseir, no problem, helping out this community helps me  by making it stronger
[01:02] <Terminus> holycow: like kitche said, AC97 could work(never tried it myself) and the forcedeth driver that comes with the kernel hasn't failed me yet on other installs.
[01:02] <hikenboot> anyone know how to convert a debian deb package to a ubuntu package?
[01:02] <Keyseir> holycow, =)
[01:03] <hikenboot> is there somthing like alien out there
[01:03] <Zaggynl> hikenboot, ubuntu uses .deb files
[01:03] <Zaggynl> no need for converting afaik
[01:03] <hikenboot> right I was told they wont work on ubuntu though
[01:03] <mat1> how i check my rendering dire?ct
[01:03] <VigoFusion> I got sound yipeeee
[01:03] <Celldweller> heyya guys....
[01:03] <SurfnKid> LjL, nevermind ill just run that command from the prompt lol
[01:03] <hikenboot> is this true?
[01:03] <LjL> hikenboot, that's correct, but it's not a problem of packaging formats. RPMs tend to not work (and/or break things) even after you convert them with alien
[01:04] <holycow> hikenboot, there is alien yes
[01:04] <LjL> hikenboot: you shouldn't use Debian packages because they normally require different versions of dependencies, etc
[01:04] <holycow> what LjL said
[01:04] <Zaggynl> They've worked here, only had some dependency issues, but I only had to get those to get it working
[01:04] <holycow> indeed, i really gotta get some time to write some noob overview wiki docs that explain things in diagrams
[01:05] <holycow> like ubuntu 101 or something :)
[01:05] <rioghal> wow this window manager is quite nice
[01:05] <Celldweller> I need to get a copy of winblows 200 pro  to dual boot with ubuntu.. I use windows to mix music with sony software.. does anyone know where i can get an iso or anything of that sort
[01:05] <javaJake> Can anyone help me install hotplug?
[01:05] <rioghal> Window Maker 
[01:05] <holycow> rioghal, which one are you using?
[01:05] <javaJake> rioghal, wow... how'd you do that character?
[01:05] <holycow> javaJake, hotplug? you don't install that, its already present
[01:05] <holycow> infact you cannot really remove it without hosing your box
[01:05] <javaJake> holycow, holycow! ;)
[01:06] <javaJake> holycow, so, yea, really?
[01:06] <rioghal> javaJake, copy & pasted it into xchat's auto-replace 
[01:06] <javaJake> Oh, right!
[01:06] <javaJake> So where are the usermap files then?
[01:06] <Luci3n> graham you back yet
[01:06] <Celldweller> i've got 5 boxes
[01:06] <Celldweller> we're wiping the dell
[01:06] <holycow> Celldweller, we cannot tell you anything about windows warez ... you might consider using mixing software on linux.  there is quite a lot of it.  search for multimedia knoppix live cd to test out a lot of the tools available?
[01:07] <holycow> Celldweller, maybe ebay is your best bet or something
[01:07] <holycow> javaJake, yes, why are you worried about hotplug anyway?
[01:07] <javaJake> Because I need to have a script executed when I plug in the WUSB54GS USB device
[01:07] <Celldweller> holycow, i've owned the software before and have lost the cd, much like most computer geeks
[01:07] <javaJake> (Long story why I need it, but I do.)
[01:07] <Celldweller> lol
[01:07] <jramsey>  anyone with ideas why java apps won't run in firefox on breezy? i have gcj installed (including the plugin) and update_alternatives shows gcj as the java provider
[01:08] <Celldweller> but i shall look somewhere else
[01:08] <holycow> Celldweller, nothing we can help you with, welcome to the wonderfull world of microsoft licencing bs
[01:08] <Celldweller> if that is the case
[01:08] <Celldweller> lol
[01:08] <Celldweller> i know
[01:08] <javaJake> !language | holycoq
[01:08] <ubotu> holycoq: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:08] <javaJake> Rats
[01:08] <Celldweller> thats why i use ubuntu and slackware
[01:08] <javaJake> Well, you get the idea
[01:08] <Celldweller> lol
[01:08] <Celldweller> i fuckin hate windows
[01:08] <holycow> javaJake, whats with the long story why you need it? i don't get how you could NEED IT when its installed BY DEFAULT?
[01:08] <holycow> :)
[01:08] <VigoFusion> Celldweller: Make a backup of the system before you wipe the dell?
[01:08] <javaJake> :|
[01:08] <Celldweller> it just has my software i paid for
[01:08] <holycow> Celldweller, indeedy
[01:08] <Celldweller> yes its already backed up
[01:08] <Luci3n> celldweller i hate windows to
[01:08] <Celldweller> and its wiped
[01:09] <Celldweller> i just need to burn an iso file
[01:09] <graham> am i back on now
[01:09] <graham>  yey
[01:09] <mat1> my video card is doing this direct rendering: No
[01:09] <VigoFusion> Use ImgBurn or somesuch tghing
[01:09] <holycow> graham, wb
[01:09] <holycow> hehe
[01:09] <javaJake> holycow, no no, I need to run a script when a device is plugged in.
[01:09] <javaJake> holycow, that's it
[01:09] <snowshoefox> HOw do I prevent a hard drive from being loaded at bootup?
[01:09] <graham> yup at last lol
[01:09] <holycow> javaJake, oh then just look up how to use it, its all there.  nothing would work on ubuntu/debian if it didn't have hotplug really
[01:09] <graham> did you get that error??
[01:09] <Celldweller> tell it not to boot it in the bios
[01:10] <Qwell> So, can somebody point me to the right tool to recompile a kernel, and have it end up as a dpkg?
[01:10] <Celldweller> snowshoefox,
[01:10] <Lovloss> is it possible to make a drive that windows has been running on anything other than read-only?
[01:10] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell Qwell about kernel | Qwell, you have a private message from Ubotu
[01:10] <Lovloss> from linux i mean
[01:10] <Luci3n> graham get on you private chat
[01:10] <marltu> how to download whole directory from ftp?
[01:10] <Qwell> LjL: Thanks
[01:10] <javaJake> holycow, I must be doing something wrong then. My computer does wierd things.
[01:10] <Lovloss> i can only seem to copy
[01:10] <LjL> marltu: you could use wget
[01:10] <mat1> direct rendering: No and it needs to be yes to run beryl:(
[01:10] <graham> saying private is blocked due to spam and i aint a member
[01:10] <jramsey>  anyone with ideas why java apps won't run in firefox on breezy? i have gcj installed (including the plugin) and update_alternatives shows gcj as the java provider
[01:11] <marltu> LjL: wget -r?
[01:11] <javaJake> jramsey, check about:plugins
[01:11] <jramsey> ??
[01:11] <holycow> Lovloss, if its in ntfs you have two options:  no and yes.  no meaning there isno real proven reliable ntfs write support ... OR ... yes there is an ntfs driver being worked on appearently and recently had a beta release or something.  if you value your ntfs data and integrity the general consensus is not to write to ntfs directly, but run it as a server and write to it via samba network share
[01:11] <javaJake> jramsey, punch in "about:plugins" in your browser
[01:11] <javaJake> in firefox*
[01:11] <snowshoefox> yea don't write to NTFS, i lost a months work because of it once
[01:12] <Lovloss> i can move stuff *from* it using gksudo, but i cant get to it because i miffed windows up and i cant boot from it now
[01:12] <holycow> again, welcome to the proprietary world of microsoft where nothing works without paying an extortion fee
[01:12] <Luci3n> have you been able to download the deb files
[01:12] <bhudda> can you read from NTFS safely though?
[01:12] <Lovloss> i think i may just copy everything off and bomb it
[01:12] <javaJake> snowshoefox, did you back up "like a good little boy would"? :D
[01:12] <snowshoefox> of course not
[01:12] <DigitalNinja> I'm having libirary issues
[01:12] <jramsey> javaJake, GCJ web browser plug-in 0.3.2
[01:12] <javaJake> jramsey, OK

[01:12] <holycow> Lovloss, correct, back everything up using linux, then plug hd back in and reinstall.  you won't be getting stuff back on to ntfs reliably as a locally mounted partition
[01:12] <graham> how do i register??
[01:13] <holycow> !register

[01:13] <graham> !register
[01:13] <Celldweller> bhudda yea
[01:13] <javaJake> bhudda, yes, in case you wanted my opioning
[01:13] <graham> lol that did alot
[01:13] <jramsey> seems like it ought to run java apps but the pogo games wont run with a whine msg about java not being installed or not working
[01:13] <Celldweller> lol
[01:13] <Lovloss> okay. one more question. How can i copy files to linux in such a way that i dont have to chown each and every folder :P
[01:13] <javaJake> bhudda, yes, in case you wanted my opinion*
[01:13] <preaction> jramsey, do not use GCJ, it does not work. use blackdown java or sun's java for linux
[01:13] <iwkse> snowshoefox: did you used ntfs-3g when you lost data?
[01:13] <holycow> graham, you haveto be registered to use the bot i think ... at leats i think so
[01:13] <graham> how do i do that??

[01:14] <javaJake> bhudda, google is your bud.
[01:14] <holycow> Lovloss, depends on the filesystem ... you do haveto chown the entire mounted device if the system is reading the guest filesystem permissions.  thats just the nature of fs security
[01:14] <Lovloss> oh i can just chown the entire mount? :D
[01:14] <holycow> yes
[01:14] <Lovloss> oh sweet
[01:14] <holycow> indeedy :)
[01:14] <Lovloss> ill just do that. duh *slaps forhead*
[01:15] <Lovloss> cya guys, thanks
[01:15] <javaJake> holycow, Lovloss, you can just punch in the appropriate options in /etc/fstab. :|
[01:15] <holycow> don't forget a -R in chown to actually change it recursively
[01:15] <Lovloss> yep i know
[01:15] <LjL> marltu: yup, think so, off my head
[01:15] <Lovloss> thanks
[01:15] <javaJake> holycow, doesn't that only work down one folder?
[01:15] <Luci3n> graham have you downloaded http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/misc/ndiswrapper-utils and http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/ndisgtk
[01:15] <Jordan_U> Lovloss: You probably want to fix that in your fstab, not with chown
[01:15] <holycow> javaJake, no -R is recursive
[01:15] <javaJake> holycow, down one folder, or all folders? For some reason chown never went down omre then one folder for me. :|
[01:16] <holycow> you only fix that in fstab if its a permanent recurring mount.  if its a single mount that you mounted manually you just do it by hand, its faster
[01:16] <holycow> javaJake, ll folders
[01:16] <DigitalNinja> Some of my systems have libglib2 version 2.10.2. Others have version 2.10.3. What's going on here?
[01:16] <VigoFusion> supper time or somethin, bbl
[01:16] <snowshoefox> iwkse, now it happened before ntfs-3g was released
[01:16] <javaJake> holycow, ok
[01:16] <javaJake> I gotta dash
[01:16] <holycow> javaJake, well; you didn't do chown -R user.group some.dir.location
[01:16] <javaJake> Tata everyone
[01:16] <snowshoefox> iwkse, *no
[01:16] <iwkse> snowshoefox: ah..ok
[01:17] <Luci3n> graham you still there??
[01:17] <javaJake> Dinna (yum)
[01:17] <Apex> What plays the system's sound events, can I change players?
[01:17] <jramsey> preaction, installing blackdown now
[01:17] <Jordan_U> DigitalNinja: It is probably because both are in the repos and you have different applications that depend on different versions.
[01:17] <redDEADresolve> hey guys im looking for a good guide to install beryl on Ubuntu 6.10 with my ati driver already installed
[01:17] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell redDEADresolve about beryl | redDEADresolve, you have a private message from Ubotu
[01:17] <graham> yes
[01:17] <preaction> jramsey, realize that blackdown is 1.4 and sun's is latest, so again some things may not work correctly
[01:17] <F28> Is there a free alternative to VMware for linux?
[01:18] <LjL> !info qemu | F28
[01:18] <holycow> i would use suns package and follow the wiki on how to create your own deb out of the binary
[01:18] <ubotu> qemu: fast processor emulator. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.2-0ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 3630 kB, installed size 9860 kB (Only available for amd64 i386 powerpc alpha sparc arm s390)
[01:18] <iwkse> F28: VMware player is fre
[01:18] <Zaggynl> Anyone in here uses AIGLX on dapper?
[01:18] <holycow> its actually very easy
[01:18] <Luci3n> graham write my name before the message it's difficult to read other wise
[01:18] <iwkse> just just qemu+vmplayer
[01:18] <holycow> or just wait until java is gpl'd and then it will be a simple install
[01:18] <LjL> iwkse: not "free" as in in the FSF "free software" definition
[01:18] <graham> luci3n ok
[01:18] <Skwid_> i was wondering, ntfs read/write is still not stable right ?
[01:18] <Luci3n> graham have you downloaded the two packages i mentioned before
[01:18] <iwkse> LjL: yes..right
[01:18] <DigitalNinja> Jordan_U: Well, my main workstation has 2.10.3. I need to install the dev libraries but they are 2.10.2. How do I update/install them
[01:18] <jramsey> well it cant work less than than not at all
[01:18] <holycow> Skwid_, read has always been stable
[01:19] <graham> luci3n i cant send private chat
[01:19] <mjr> Skwid_, one would do well not to trust it too much; write, that is.
[01:19] <holycow> Skwid_, write is not
[01:19] <Skwid_> holycow: write :)
[01:19] <Skwid_> ok thank you
[01:19] <graham> luci3n brb
[01:19] <Skwid_> if i have fat32
[01:19] <Luci3n> graham: don't worry about private chat
[01:19] <LjL> graham, the bot has sent you information about registering so you can send private messages
[01:19] <Skwid_> it should be safe to symlink firefox profiles etc right ?

[01:20] <Jordan_U> DigitalNinja: Have you tried just sudo apt-get install packagename-version-dev
[01:20] <Jordan_U> ?
[01:20] <prower> Hello :> I had wireless with WAP-EAP and all working fine with wpa_supplicant with Ubuntu 6.06.1...then I upgraded to the latest kernel and modules, and now it can't find the madwifi module when I try to load it :/ Has it been renamed?
[01:20] <DigitalNinja> Jordan_U: No. How do I tell apt what version I want
[01:21] <Luci3n> graham: have you downloaded the ndiswrapper utils
[01:21] <Jordan_U> DigitalNinja: What package / version do you need again?
=== Braddock is now known as Bradopussy
[01:21] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: sudo apt-get install package=version
[01:22] <jramsey> preaction, it works ... thanks for ur help
[01:22] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: where version is one of the ones shown in 'apt-cache policy package'
[01:22] <DigitalNinja> Jordan_U: libglib2.0-dev version 2.10.3. However, synaptic only shows version 2.10.2
[01:23] <Luci3n> graham open synaptic and search for ndis
[01:23] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: Let me check that last command
[01:23] <Luci3n> graham system > administration > synaptic package manager
[01:24] <Qwell> LjL: This instructions are pretty bad ;)
[01:24] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: It only shows version 2.10.2. I need version 2.10.3
[01:24] <Gizzle> Question, i am running edgy 6.10 - why is the scrolling not smooth in firefox and all other applications?
[01:24] <holycow> Gizzle, probably because you don't have 3d accelerated drivers for your video card
[01:25] <DigitalNinja> holycow: Firfox isn't 3D
[01:25] <graham> luci3n got ndiswrapper-utils 1.8-oubuntu2 and nasm there ae check boxes but nothing in them
[01:26] <Gizzle> holycow, how do i obtain such driver - my card is a radeon 9500?
[01:26] <apokryphos> Gizzle: check the FAQ =)
[01:26] <holycow> DigitalNinja, please consider not commenting on things your not an expert on :)
[01:26] <holycow> !ati
[01:26] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:26] <Jordan_U> DigitalNinja: But no 3D probably means bad 2D acceleration also.
[01:26] <h00t> i'm sorry i know this is stupid but how the hell do you escape from a man page in terminal ... Alt-x or something
[01:26] <Luci3n> graham have you got ndisgtk ther
[01:26] <holycow> Gizzle, you want to make sure you have accelerated drivers installed as per those instructions
[01:26] <holycow> indeed, 3d is a superset of 2d at this point in time
[01:27] <apokryphos> h00t: q
[01:27] <Luci3n> graham there should be 4 or 5 items for selection
[01:27] <h00t> apo
[01:27] <h00t> thanx
[01:27] <DigitalNinja> holycow: Well, I've got systems with no 3D driver and the scroling in Firfox works just fine. Hows that for beeing an expert.
[01:27] <Gizzle> holycow, okay thanks very much
[01:27] <graham> luci3n there are only those 2 that i mentioned that is all
[01:27] <Anderson> What command can I use to check disk usage?
[01:27] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: Is this Dapper?
[01:27] <holycow> and regardless chances are that if hes not running 3d accelerated drivers hes probably not running 2d accelerated either but vesa or some such
[01:27] <bimberi> Anderson: df
[01:27] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: Yup!
[01:27] <Anderson> bimberi, Thank you.
[01:28] <Luci3n> graham download http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/misc/ndiswrapper-utils
[01:28] <bimberi> Anderson: 'df -h' is a bit more readable :)
=== Bradopussy is now known as Olipro
[01:28] <holycow> DigitalNinja, that just shows you don't have a clue ... which is okay.  a touch of humble pie goes a long way tho
[01:28] <kayxray> I used 'dd if=/dev/hda1 | gzip -9 > WinXP.img.gz' to backup my Windows XP partition.  When I try to use 'gunzip WinXP.img.gz - | dd of=/dev/hda1' to try and restore it, it tries to write WinXP.img (from WinXP.img.gz) but runs out of space.  Can I unzip directly to dd like I did with zip?
[01:28] <Luci3n> graham the download http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/ndisgtk
[01:28] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: the dapper-updates repository has 2.10.3, do you have that enabled?
[01:28] <Jordan_U> DigitalNinja: I have an nvidia card that has horrible scrolling using nv but not with nvidia , some 2d only drivers are good enough, some aren't
[01:28] <Luci3n> graham save them both to your home directory
[01:29] <DigitalNinja> holycow: Just letting you know that I don't use 3D drivers for some things
[01:29] <holycow> DigitalNinja, i'm aware of that without requiring the heads up :)  got it.  thank you.
[01:29] <graham> luci3n there is a choice of 2 but i am not running a 64 bit which one do i need?? the i386??
[01:29] <Luci3n> graham yes
[01:30] <DigitalNinja> Jordan_U: I see
[01:30] <veet> help me please
[01:30] <holycow> veet, okay, whats the problem?
[01:30] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: I think so. I just did an update but I'll double check
[01:30] <veet> i try to install matlab program
[01:30] <veet> installer ask me for cd2
[01:30] <veet> but i don't eject cd1
[01:30] <graham> luci3n umm there are lots of small print selections for europe which one do i need??
[01:30] <veet> device busy
[01:31] <Lovloss> im confused. I just mounted /dev/hda1 to /Desktop/d   succesfuly but i cant open it. It says i have no permissions - even after i tried chowning it
[01:31] <Anderson> Is anyone familiar with the smartmontools daemon?
[01:31] <graham> luci3n does it matter??
[01:31] <holycow> veet, pressing the cdrom button doesn't work either?
[01:31] <mcphail> kayxray: have you tried gunzip -c file instead of gunzip file - ?
[01:31] <veet> no
[01:31] <veet> cdrom button disables
[01:31] <Jordan_U> veet: Do you have any windows open in a directory on the CD?
[01:31] <veet> cdrom button disabled
[01:31] <phobiac> Anyone have any experience with using gparted to manage partions? I want to know if it's possible to combine my two ext3 partions into one.
[01:31] <Luci3n> graham select one close to you in the uk
[01:31] <veet> only matlab window
[01:31] <holycow> Jordan_U, oh good call, forgot about that
[01:31] <graham> luci3n how do i save to home??
[01:32] <veet> i can't close it
[01:32] <Lovloss> this is what i get when i try to chown that directory : chown: changing ownership of `/home/lovloss/Desktop/d': Read-only file system
[01:32] <iwkse> veet: try to force umount
[01:32] <holycow> veet, why can't you close matlab window?
[01:32] <siegie> i want to sign the code of conduct, I must now do gpg --clearsign UbuntuCodeOfConduct-1.0.1.txt and copy past the its contents but when i click on continue he keeps tellings me fix problems no public key
[01:32] <Luci3n> graham are u using firefox
[01:32] <graham> luci3n yes
[01:32] <veet> i'm going to install matlab program from cd1!!
[01:32] <iwkse> veet: you can use or umount -f or a good hammer
[01:33] <Anderson> Is anyone familiar with the smartmontools daemon?
[01:33] <veet> umount -f doesn't works: devicd busy
[01:33] <phobiac> Anyone have any experience with using gparted to manage partions? I want to know if it's possible to combine my two ext3 partions into one.
[01:33] <MsClock> That wasn't very funny...
[01:33] <veet> umount impossible
[01:33] <Luci3n> graham when it prompts you to save save it to your home directory /home/yourusername
[01:33] <iwkse> veet: why don't you try octave?
[01:33] <holycow> !matlab
[01:33] <veet> i don't know octave
[01:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about matlab - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:33] <Lovloss> oh, gksudo cant either
[01:33] <Lovloss> oy
[01:33] <h00t> what's a difference between "apt-get update" & "apt-get upgrade"
[01:33] <holycow> i have no idea what matlab is either or how it installs
[01:34] <holycow> veet, does matlab have an ubuntu installer? how are you installing this?
[01:34] <graham> luci3n gives me option of gdebi package installer or save to disk which one?
[01:34] <Anderson> h00t, upgrade will upgrade all of your out of date packages
[01:34] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: It was missing. I only had the src one in there. Lets see if it works this time
[01:34] <graham> luci3n lol i am so thick
[01:34] <LjL> h00t: update just reads the list of available packages, and caches it. upgrade installs new upgraded packages
[01:34] <Jordan_U> h00t: upgrade can remove obsolete packages.
[01:34] <veet> from matlab original cd
[01:34] <veet> 3 cdrom
[01:34] <holycow> veet, what do you mean original cd? is matlab available natively for linux?
[01:34] <iwkse> matlab for linux?
[01:34] <Luci3n> gdebi will install it for automatically
[01:34] <holycow> or are you trying to use windows cd?
[01:34] <iwkse> huh
[01:34] <LjL> Jordan_U, actually i don't think upgrade ever removes anything, that's what dist-upgrade does
[01:34] <Jordan_U> h00t: never mind, I thought you meant dist upgrade vs upgrade :)
[01:34] <veet> matlab for linux and mac
[01:34] <Anderson> h00t, upgrade-distro will update to the latest distrobution if you make the changes in your apt repositories
[01:34] <LjL> Anderson: dist-upgrade
[01:35] <holycow> veet, oh so they have a custom install script then probably.  they are bypassing the package manager
[01:35] <Anderson> LjL, YEA, sorry.
[01:35] <bellemerlord> Hi, i got a Problem with my edgy. When i login, there is no wallpaper, no icons on the desktop, nautilus doesnt start anymore and a rightclick on the desktop has no effekt. Can someone pleas help me?
[01:35] <LjL> Anderson: and it's often not the best way to upgrade to a *new* distribution
[01:35] <LjL> !upgrade
[01:35] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[01:35] <veet> of course
[01:35] <Jordan_U> LjL: I know brain fart :)
[01:35] <veet> but only problem is cdrom eject
[01:35] <holycow> veet, sounds like their custom script sucks and doesn't want to let go of the cdrom device for some reason.  i guess you have rebooted a few times and tried a few things?
[01:35] <graham> l;uci3n it said same version is available in a channel and the closed what does that mean??
[01:36] <LjL> veet: have you tried typing "eject"?
[01:36] <mcphail> veet: have you tried a umount -l ?
[01:36] <w3ccv> I'm a new Edgy Eft user, the network device manager GUI recognizes my LinkSYS PCMCIA nic, and will connect to my home AP if it is in OPEN mode. But I cannot connect in 128bit WEP mode, hmmm!  How??
[01:36] <veet> yes holycow, many times
[01:36] <Luci3n> graham try saving it to your disk
[01:36] <LjL> veet: and the error is?
[01:36] <graham> luci3n ok
[01:36] <mimi> can anyone help me configure a motorola razr v3 with multisync and evolution please
[01:36] <veet> umount -l: command not found
[01:36] <holycow> veet, i'm out of ideas ... the suggestions by the other folks are good ... beyond that i would haveto play with matlab to get an idea of whats going on, sorry i won't be able to help any further
[01:36] <felixjet> when i start the computer, gnome dont load the apps that i left opened before close system. i mean, i dont get any "restored session". how can i fix it?
[01:37] <veet> thank you holycow
[01:37] <Jordan_U> veet: Any terminals open?
[01:37] <Skwid_> apokryphos: thanks, i found my happiness now :) using banshee + music applet, awesome !
[01:37] <veet> yes
[01:37] <Anderson> What command shows my current version number?
[01:37] <apokryphos> Skwid_: cool =)
[01:37] <protolnx> is there a nintendo DS emulator for linux?? There are tons for m$$ i don't seem to find any for linx
[01:37] <Jordan_U> veet: Are they cd'd into a dir on the CD?
[01:37] <mcphail> veet: did you type umount or unmount?
[01:37] <apokryphos> Skwid_: the one thing banshee has over amarok still is daapd server+client
[01:37] <h00t> I have a bit of a problem I've uninstalled old automatix since i've just upgraded to latest version "edgy" ... now I installed new "automatix2" ... the problem is that it doesn't recognize any software that the old version installed ... how can i remove the old versions of the software
[01:37] <w3ccv> Anderson - try `uname -a`
[01:37] <apokryphos> Skwid_: amarok has started one, but it's not nearly as mature
[01:38] <Anderson> w3ccv, I get the kernel version with that, but not the distrobution number.
[01:38] <smallfoot-> if anyone know a hardware company that done something good or bad such as cooperate with open source or anti-competive, please add it to http://vendors.bluwiki.org/
[01:38] <veet> umount
[01:38] <Luci3n> graham you finished yet
[01:38] <LjL> !automatix | h00t
[01:38] <ubotu> h00t: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:38] <graham> luci3n now it says the default kernel provides the required modules if you use the custom module you may also need the kernal module package
[01:38] <Falcongrinder> does anyone know of a cd/dvd burning software that doesnt have problems?
[01:38] <mcphail> veet: your system should have a umount command!
[01:38] <graham> luci3n ???
[01:39] <veet> andrea@andrea-laptop:~$ umount -l
[01:39] <veet> Usage: umount [-hV] 
[01:39] <veet>        umount -a [-f]  [-r]  [-n]  [-v]  [-t vfstypes]  [-O opts] 
[01:39] <veet>        umount [-f]  [-r]  [-n]  [-v]  special | node...
[01:39] <h00t> well that helps
[01:39] <Jordan_U> smallfoot-: Try #ubuntu-offtopic, you will probably get a lot of suggestions there.
[01:39] <graham> luci3n I am lost
[01:39] <Luci3n> graham try it anyway
[01:39] <veet> this is the answer
[01:39] <Anderson> Is there any command for finding the distrobution number?
[01:39] <mcphail> veet: are you on edgy?
[01:39] <bimberi> !version | Anderson
[01:39] <ubotu> Anderson: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[01:39] <veet> yes
[01:39] <Luci3n> graham i've just installed it on my machine here as we speak
[01:39] <Lovloss> yay i did it. im backing up my HD
[01:39] <mcphail> veet: maybe they removed the "lazy unmount" option. I'm using dapper...
[01:39] <protolnx> is there a nintendo DS emulator for linux?? There are tons for m$$ i don't seem to find any for linx
[01:39] <Lovloss> So i managed to get my girlfriend to switch to ubuntu. She got so excited by the add/remove program "You mean this is all FREEE!?"
[01:40] <veet> ah ok
[01:40] <iwkse> mcphail: there's too in edgy
[01:40] <lechat> t
[01:40] <Jordan_U> veet: Again, are any of your terminals in a directory that is on the CD, you may want to just close them all to be sure.
[01:40] <veet> andrea@andrea-laptop:~$ eject cdrom
[01:40] <veet> umount: /media/cdrom0: device busy
[01:40] <holycow> Lovloss, nice :)
[01:40] <agent> h00t: realize that automatix people have attitude problems (why they left ubuntuforums) and they think automatix is perfect and can never break any system whatsoever... hence people here don't even try helping with automatix :)
[01:40] <Luci3n> Lovloss i removed XP from my machine and my wife has never used the pc since
[01:40] <holycow> tell her community support is free too and point her here
[01:41] <graham> luci3n I have ndiswrapper-utils_18-oubuntu2_i386.deb on my desktop is this correct?
[01:41] <holycow> Luci3n, lol why? thats weird
[01:41] <Lovloss> Its funny. i added linux thinking I was going to dual boot with windows xp about equally. Im now deleting XP. its worthless
[01:41] <Lovloss> yes, ill definately show her the community
[01:41] <graham> luci3n its a package also
[01:41] <Luci3n> holycow dunno i think she is afraid
[01:41] <holycow> re: automatix, we really need to start advising against ever using automatix
[01:41] <h00t> i don't think that it's perfect ... i obviously just fucked my system ... just trying to fix things now... :)
[01:41] <apokryphos> holycow: we do :)
[01:41] <apokryphos> !automatix
[01:41] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:41] <holycow> there really needs to be a push to kill that project, its absolutely a horrible way to do anything
[01:41] <Luci3n> ok now click on the utils package and install it first
[01:42] <LjL> !language | h00t ;)
[01:42] <ubotu> h00t ;): Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:42] <holycow> apokryphos, oh you did add that little bit at the end :)
[01:42] <holycow> nice
[01:42] <Lovloss> yeah i was going to say
[01:42] <graham> luci3n how do i do that (you are being an exellent help thankyou so far)
[01:42] <Jordan_U> Luci3n: Just keep a big Firefox logo on the Desktop and maybe she will think, hey I know that :)
[01:42] <apokryphos> holycow: forum users love it, as it goes.
[01:42] <Lovloss> I cant believe how fast linux copies and moves files! Windows never wnet this fast
[01:42] <holycow> h00t, if anyone installs automatix, i simply tell them to reinstall.  its painfull but a lot less painfull then actually fixing their stuff
[01:42] <Lovloss> it must be the ext3 format among other things
[01:43] <holycow> apokryphos, i think they only love the idea.  when they run into a problem they learn
[01:43] <bobby_> !sound
[01:43] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[01:43] <graham> luci3n be right back i am just getting a drink
[01:43] <Luci3n> Jordan_U i'm afraid she is very stuck to IE and outlook MSN and it takes time for here to come round
[01:43] <LjL> Lovloss, Linux also tends to be quite aggressive with file caching
[01:43] <apokryphos> holycow: you'd think so, but it's still regarded quite highly there.
[01:43] <Luci3n> graham I'll have a coffee thanxs
[01:43] <holycow> i would go so far as to say that i would pay for an extension to the forums or some bot thing in here that whenever automatix is mentioned a huge piece of spam is posted on the thread to annoy the buggers :)
=== borg is now known as botxj
[01:43] <Anderson> Is my understanding correct that gksu is used to utilize commands for graphical applications, without using the GUI?
[01:43] <Lovloss> so did everyone hear about microsoft and Suse joining forces via Novell?
[01:43] <holycow> apokryphos, really? wow
[01:43] <grndslm> anybody using edgy and beryl on intel graphics??
[01:44] <apokryphos> Anderson: gksu is used for when you need to run a graphical program as root
[01:44] <Jordan_U> Luci3n: If she is REALLY stubborn, A: update her XP machine to IE7 which is different ;) or IE4Linux :)
[01:44] <Lovloss> careful with gksudo
[01:44] <LjL> Anderson: hm, not sure what you're saying... gksudo (and gksu) are used to run graphical programs as root
[01:44] <apokryphos> Anderson: it should generally be avoided, but if you *have* to, that's the best way.
[01:44] <DigitalNinja> bimberi: It's working! Thanks
[01:44] <LjL> !offtopic | Lovloss
[01:44] <ubotu> Lovloss: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:44] <bimberi> DigitalNinja: cool. np :)
[01:44] <Anderson> apokryphos, I see, thanks for clarifying.
[01:44] <holycow> Lovloss, they didn't join forces, they signed an agreement on which they now disagree.  microsoft is interested in the divide/conquor strategy with respect to linux
[01:44] <Luci3n> Jordan_U I updated IE for her and then she complained ;)
[01:44] <Anderson> apokryphos, Why is it not recommended?
[01:45] <Lovloss> gksudo should be avoided because you can do anything in it to your files, including delete system stuff
[01:45] <holycow> essentially the agreement means death for novell as now windows users hate then AND linux users are strongly negative on them
[01:45] <Lovloss> i see holycow, thanks
[01:45] <Luci3n> Jordan_U I think she would like IE4Linux mmm, maybe
[01:45] <Lovloss> good to know... but lets not stray off topic if that bothers people ^_^
[01:45] <holycow> but thats my opinion, i've been wrong often :)
[01:45] <h00t> holycow, wait a minute it can't be that bad... i installed some things w/ automatix ... the problem is that add/remove applet doesn't see them as installed, i gues i'll have to remove them w/ apt ... can someone tell me how to make apt check what packages i have
[01:45] <apokryphos> Anderson: you can bork your system by a single wrong click and if you always run as root it undermines the whole root/user distinction that we have in wonderful Linux
[01:45] <Jordan_U> Luci3n: Lucky her, IE7 doesn't worki in Linux :) , but yeah #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:45] <holycow> h00t, it Is VERYT VERY VERY BAD
[01:46] <LjL> h00t: "dpkg --get-selections" lists the installed (and previously installed) packages
[01:46] <Lovloss> I use gksudo all the time because i have to mess with write-protected drives
[01:46] <Lovloss> Just stay out of anything but /home/ or media/<something>
[01:46] <holycow> if you use automatix you are bypassing the package manager and you are allowing some unknown group of people with very dubious reputations (read children with tiny egos) do a lot of nasty things to your box in the background
[01:46] <apokryphos> Lovloss: why do you need root for write-protected drives?
[01:46] <Anderson> apokryphos, Makes sense.
[01:46] <holycow> h00t, THE REASON that it is bad, IS BECAUSE all they had to do was create a bunch of new installers and metapackages and host their own repos
[01:46] <Lovloss> because they wont let me look at them, since they're not mounted logically
[01:47] <Lovloss> i have to mount them via sudo, and they come with permissions
[01:47] <Qwell> LjL: Got any other wiki links, perhaps one that isn't completely inaccurate? :)
[01:47] <Who_> anyone know how to change the User Interface font for WINE applications?
[01:47] <Lovloss> I unplugged them when i installed linux you see, so that grub wouldnt get put on the other drive... again
[01:47] <h00t> holycow,  ... so it's a hack
[01:47] <Lovloss> that was annoying
[01:47] <apokryphos> Lovloss: you can change that; the user option
[01:47] <holycow> h00t, so what you get is a custom install of some custom stuff UNDERNEATH your system, and god knows what changes are made to your box.  you just don't know
[01:47] <Jordan_U> Who_: AFIK, only registry edits :(
[01:47] <Lovloss> hmm? what do you mean
[01:48] <LjL> Qwell: no, sorry. that's the official wiki though, so if you find better instructions, perhaps you'll want to correct the wiki
[01:48] <apokryphos> h00t: the idea itself is fine and dandy, it's just badly executed in automatix's case.
[01:48] <merverferker> anyone happen to know a method to connect my ipod?
[01:48] <Who_> Jordan_U; yea - I'm looking at the registry now - I can't seem to find where to change it
[01:48] <MsClock> Why do the Ubuntu forum people have sticks up their asses...?
[01:48] <apokryphos> Lovloss: if your fstab entry has the user option then you don't require root privs to mount it
[01:48] <MsClock> Damn I have a PERT chart to draw
[01:48] <Qwell> LjL: well, hell
[01:48] <holycow> h00t, thats basically it, the thing is, its a bad hack on a magnificent level.  building installers and packages on dpkg is so simple (lots of work but not complicated) that its so super nice to do it right
[01:48] <apokryphos> MsClock: come on, language please :)
[01:48] <h00t> so the big question is ... is there anything automatix CAN do that I cannot do on my own
[01:48] <Lovloss> hmm i need to learn how to do that... i wont mess with it right now though, i have copying going on
[01:48] <LjL> h00t: no
[01:48] <Who_> Jordan_U: there seem to be a bunch of _binary_ options that might represent the font to use, but I have no idea how to generate the right stuff
[01:48] <Lovloss> it wont matter in a bit though
[01:49] <apokryphos> h00t: faq + documentation + wiki :)
[01:49] <holycow> h00t, the thing  is you look at their work and shake your head ... you haveto work VERY VERY hard to go out of your way to build something like that when dpkg / apt are so easy to do right
[01:49] <Jordan_U> Who_: If you want clearlooks there is a clearlooks theme file ( I don't use win so I don't remember what filetype themes are ) that works with WINE.
[01:49] <holycow> h00t, no
[01:49] <h00t> coming from debian ... all i can say ... BOW BEFORE APT-GET
[01:49] <Who_> Jordan_U: have you tyried it? I tried it an all widgets rendered _really_ slowly
[01:49] <Lovloss> apt-get is fine
[01:49] <Lovloss> i wouldnt use anything more
[01:49] <holycow> h00t, it just makes sense.  its not hard to actually do a custom anything in it
[01:49] <Who_> Jordan_U: they are .msstyles, as far as I have found
[01:50] <holycow> this is why i kinda wince when i hear people running things like matlab installers
[01:50] <rioghal> for those of you who use a wm that doesnt have a notification area in-built, i just found a very nice systray dockapp: http://sourceforge.net/projects/peksystray/
[01:50] <h00t> what are "metlab" installers
[01:50] <holycow> where its some shitty bash script because their devs are too lazy to setup proper build system and package things right
[01:50] <Lovloss> wow. language today
[01:50] <Jordan_U> Who_: Worked fine for me, but with flash 9 I have no more need for WINE, yeah .msstyles was it.
[01:50] <apokryphos> holycow: come on, please watch the language
[01:51] <Lovloss> you know guys, i do the sailor talk a lot too, but this is a place for intellectual discussion
[01:51] <holycow> matlab is a commercial package it seems, someone here was having a hard time installintg it, partially because it uses its own installer
[01:51] <Who_> Jordan_U - you don't happen to remember where you got it do you?
[01:51] <brush01uk> Veet     , right click  the cd icon
[01:51] <apokryphos> and as LjL notes, it's probably time to continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic now
[01:51] <Jordan_U> Who_: I'll look for the link....
[01:51] <Gertoly> My system isn't seeing my hdd (it's a old 95mb), how can i probe the ide channel to see if any new devices have been connected to it?
[01:51] <Lovloss> lol 95 mgs? wow, that stough
[01:51] <pyro> oh yea "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop" and i have kde
[01:51] <h00t> so ... i'll tell you what I'll try to "somehow" fix it and see if i'll break my system and have to install from scratch
[01:51] <grndslm> could somebody explain to me why direct rendering isn't enabled on my computer with intel (i815) graphics??  and/or how to turn it on
[01:51] <Who_> Jordan_U: don't look too hard - I've got google too :)
[01:51] <Skwid_> favorite text editor guys ?
[01:52] <LjL> Gertoly: ugh. i just have to wish you good luck
[01:52] <Lovloss> Gertoly, just mount the drive and you should be able to get in. if its plugged up
[01:52] <grndslm> Skwid, gedit
[01:52] <Gertoly> yeh i know, but it isn't the size that counts right :-/
[01:52] <Luci3n> graham did you get me a coffee, black no sugar please
[01:52] <Lovloss> im doing that right now with an old HD of mine
[01:52] <rioghal> Luci3n, hahaha
[01:52] <w3ccv> emacs !!! Forever
[01:52] <holycow> Skwid_, nano :) for configuring files anyway
[01:52] <LjL> Skwid_: 900 people here, please don't ask what everyone's favorite editor is :-\ use #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:52] <Gertoly> that's the thing, i have to plug it in after i boot, or the system hangs or does not see my other hdd.
[01:52] <rioghal> Skwid_, vim ftw!
[01:52] <Skwid_> LjL: ok, sorry
[01:52] <Lovloss> oh thats because its listed in your bios as a boot
[01:52] <mjr> grndslm, /var/log/Xorg.0.log should give some clues, if you could eg. post it on pastebin.ca
[01:53] <Luci3n> Skwid komodo
[01:53] <din> happy franksgiving
[01:53] <Lovloss> in your bios, there should be a "boot order". Take that one out of the list
[01:53] <Gertoly> it's not in it
[01:53] <Lovloss> thats bizarre
[01:53] <grndslm> mjr: it says Screen 0 is not DRI capable...do you need more?
[01:54] <h00t> This was bothering me for a while ... you know how in gnome, if you have an movie file it shows as an icon of 1 frame from the movie ... how does gnome determine what frame to pick
[01:54] <Gertoly> i had this problem ~2 years ago with the same exact hdd, all i remember is i need to attach it after boot and run some kind of proble
[01:54] <mjr> grndslm, yes
[01:54] <iwkse> grndslm: disable composite
[01:54] <Anderson> Where do I find the scripts that start daemons?
[01:54] <Jordan_U> Who_: Whatever it was, I used winecfg to use the theme.
[01:54] <Kingsqueak> Anderson: /etc/init.d/
[01:54] <Who_> Jordan_U: yea - okay, that's what I was doing - was it just a regular theme designed for windows, r had it been tweaked for wine?
[01:55] <grndslm> iwkse...comment out the lines??  because they weren't in there by default in edgy, i added 'em, and still no luck so i did comment them out already
[01:55] <Ricky28269> what command locks the computer?
[01:55] <Anderson> Kingsqueak, Thanks
[01:55] <Gertoly> is there some sort of probe ide command i can use to recheck my ide devices?
[01:55] <iwkse> grndslm: Section "Extensions"
[01:55] <iwkse>         Option      "Composite" "false"
[01:55] <iwkse> EndSection
[01:55] <Lovloss> try fstab-l
[01:55] <Lovloss> that one looks at your devices
[01:55] <Lovloss> is that all he has to type guys, sudo ftsab -l
[01:55] <Jordan_U> Who_: It was a regular one for windows, but the specific version of it was known to work welll in wine.
[01:56] <grndslm> iwkse: weird, i'll try it
[01:56] <Who_> Jordan_U: thanks - I'll keep hunting :)
[01:56] <Lovloss> then "mount /dev(device) (where you want itt o go)
[01:56] <Anderson> In linux scripting, would soething that looks like this (NAME=/path/folder/file) be used for defining variables within the script?
[01:56] <mborohov> hey
[01:56] <Gertoly> yeh i'm with you on the mounting
[01:56] <NoStop> Gertoly: what are you trying to find out about your ide devices?
[01:56] <redDEADresolve> can anyone point me to the beryl channel?
[01:56] <mborohov> so i have a question with regards to getting an ipod working with ubuntu
[01:56] <Lovloss> you can try 'lspci"
[01:56] <Gertoly> you sure it's fstab -l ?
[01:56] <merverferker> ?
[01:57] <Lovloss> well i dunno, no one is backing me here.
[01:57] <Gertoly> i'm trying to get the system to use it. i have to connect it after i boot
[01:57] <mborohov> ive tried everything i can think of, but when its mounted by ubuntu automatically, i cant access it as a normal user, and furthermore, when it appears on the desktop neither amaroK nor banshee recognize it
[01:57] <NoStop> to see partitions you could use fdisk -l   (that's an L)
[01:57] <merverferker> i also need help with ipod
[01:57] <Lovloss> see
[01:57] <green_earz> Anderson: and here a link for back ground read of the init.d scripts > http://wiki.debianhelp.org/pmwiki.php/DebianHelpPages/DebianInitScripts
[01:57] <Lovloss> guys, how come when i copy large amounts of files, it gets to the end and then starts lagging up my computer
[01:57] <Lovloss> such as, say, right now
[01:58] <Lovloss> it says its tsill copying too, and my drive is making copy noises
[01:58] <Anderson> green_earz, thanks, does it cover syntax?
[01:58] <Lovloss> is it unpacking a cashe?
[01:58] <Skwid_> anybody figured out a nice way to get better web fonts in ubuntu ? :s
[01:58] <redDEADresolve> can anyone help me with beryl? the default theme is UGLY i dont want a purplr window does anyone know how to get back to the orginal theme that white and plain?
[01:58] <Skwid_> redDEADresolve: right click on the beryl in your bar
[01:58] <Daviey> Anybody know what ubuntu edgy uses as the boot splash screen?
[01:58] <Skwid_> emerald theme manager
[01:58] <Kingsqueak> redDEADresolve: click on the ruby in the taskbar and set the theme
[01:58] <mborohov> anyone have any ideas?
[01:58] <Lovloss> Gertoly, i think fdisk -l is what you need
[01:58] <mborohov> anyone have iT working?
[01:59] <redDEADresolve> yeah i want the 1.0 default theme not the purple or pink ones they use
[01:59] <grndslm> iwkse: at least X didn't crash this time...but it still complains about there not being a compisite extension....do i need the Option "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" and  Option "AIGLX" "true" lines??
[01:59] <redDEADresolve> or at least how to access more themes, it tell me i need subversion package
[02:00] <Gertoly> Lovloss: i'll try it now, but i don't remember using fdisk before.
[02:00] <Lovloss> i know, but its worked for me in the past
[02:00] <Lovloss> tell me what happens
[02:01] <graham> luci3n lol i have my tea now ran out of coffee though
[02:01] <neonempyr> Circuit simulator that works with Ubuntu?
[02:01] <Gertoly> Lovloss: in the past unde what circumstance? i'm all ears
[02:01] <graham> luci3n i have another problem now
[02:01] <iwkse> grndslm: are you using xgl?
[02:01] <Luci3n> graham yes
[02:02] <grndslm> iwkse: no, i don't think i need to with aiglx, right?
[02:02] <Lovloss> Well Gertoly I had two internal HDDS i had to unplug when i installed linux to my external, so itd be totally modular. so it did not recognize the drives
[02:02] <Lovloss> fdisk -l showed me where they were located
[02:02] <graham> luci3n it says only one software mangement tool is allowed to run at the same time
[02:02] <Gertoly> no, didn't do anything
[02:02] <iwkse> grndslm: ah..so you use aiglx...
[02:02] <mborohov> anyone have any ideas on the ipod?
[02:02] <Gertoly> i see in the man page "List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit. If no devices are given, those mentioned in /proc/partitions (if that exists) are used."
[02:02] <graham> luci3n big red stop sign with it too
[02:02] <iwkse> grndslm: you should enable composite && i can't help you
[02:02] <Anderson> What's the deal with commands and other things followed by a number in paranthesis
[02:02] <Anderson> Question mark
[02:03] <grndslm> heh...alright...thanks iwkse
[02:03] <Luci3n> graham close synaptic
[02:03] <Gertoly> think it just used /proc/partitions (which it isn't there)
[02:03] <graham> luci3n oh yeah *slaps self in head* lol
[02:03] <Gertoly> mount -t vfat isn't working either
[02:03] <graham> luci3n it's installing now
[02:04] <graham> luci3n it says it has installed now
[02:04] <Lovloss> just type "sudo fdisk -l" thats all
[02:04] <Lovloss> it wont format your disk :P
[02:04] <graham> luci3n you have a good memory
[02:04] <Gertoly> all this for a picture of my son...might have to just take another picture and make him stand on his knees to get that young effect :-p
[02:04] <Anderson> For example when you man a command it comes back with     command (x)    with x being an integer
[02:04] <Gertoly> Lovloss: that's what i did, but it didn't list anything from it, just what is working right now
[02:04] <graham> luci3n what's next i have installed the first one
[02:05] <Luci3n> graham now do the next
[02:05] <Lovloss> try /more/fstab
[02:05] <mborohov> anyone??
[02:05] <mikeo1> how do i compile linux-dri-modules-2.6.15-27-386? i cant find them anywhere
[02:05] <grndslm> whoever feels like helping me with my edgy/aiglx/beryl/intel problem...have at it, here's a copy of xorg.0.log:  http://pastebin.ca/255488
[02:05] <grndslm> mjr, there's my xorg.0.log above
[02:05] <Lovloss> sorry! "more /etc/fstab
[02:05] <Anderson> No one has information on the integer in paranthesis that follows commands and stuff when you man them?
[02:06] <mikeo1> how do i compile linux-dri-modules-2.6.15-27-386? i cant find them anywhere
[02:06] <Lovloss> "more /etc/fstab" tell syou EVERYTHING that it sees, gertoly
[02:07] <mat2> hi
[02:07] <mat2> me mat1
[02:08] <mat2> i am onther pc
[02:08] <mat2> need help
[02:08] <Daviey> Has anybody made a custom usplash?
[02:08] <mikeo1> how do i downgrade from 2.6.15-27 to 2.6.15-26?
[02:08] <mikeo1> since there are no dri modules out yet for 27
[02:08] <Lovloss> any luck?
[02:08] <mat2> i cant get beryl running here eiver and this pc haves nvidia
[02:08] <Luci3n> graham has it finished
[02:09] <graham> luci3n it has finished both are installed
[02:09] <graham> luci3n now what do i have to do?
[02:09] <Luci3n> graham you ndiswrapper in no fully functional
[02:09] <grndslm> mikeo1, you feel like upgrading to edgy?  it typically makes installing beryl a ton easier
[02:09] <mikeo1> no
[02:10] <Luci3n> graham system > admin > wireless window
[02:10] <mikeo1> this is running on a box that is mainly a server
[02:10] <mikeo1> edgy isnt that stable
[02:10] <grndslm> mikeo1, beryl on a server?
[02:10] <mikeo1> only when im infront of it
[02:10] <graham> luci3n do i have to conigure it or install new driver?
[02:10] <mikeo1> otherwise x isnt even running when im not here
[02:10] <grndslm> i haven't found a single problem with edgy and i've been running it on 3 different computers for a while
[02:10] <Anderson> What's the deal with commands and other things followed by a number in paranthesis?
[02:11] <Luci3n> graham have you any drivers installed
[02:11] <Gertoly> damn, no luck
[02:11] <mikeo1> i dont want the upgrade to nuke my pc
[02:11] <Lovloss> well i tried :(
[02:11] <graham> luci3n no i dont but i have the cd for my wireless card
[02:11] <Gertoly> yes and thank you, because i really never knew the -L switch to fdisk :-)
[02:11] <mikeo1> if there was an easy way to backup before the upgrade i would do that adn upgrade but there isnt with 200gb used
[02:11] <Lovloss> ^_^
[02:11] <w3ccv> Anderson - the number in () is the man section it is in.
[02:11] <graham> luci3n do i have to use that?
[02:11] <Luci3n> graham you'll have to get the drivers and the install them you can you normal window
[02:11] <gunfus> Hello
[02:11] <Luci3n> graham drivers
[02:12] <Lovloss> i ask so many questions here i try to offer answers now and theen
[02:12] <graham> luci3n how do i do that?>
[02:12] <Luci3n> graham what do you mean??
[02:12] <graham> luci3n i bet you think i am soo stupid
[02:12] <grndslm> mikeo1, that's why you mount your important directories on separate partitions
[02:12] <Luci3n> graham never ;)
[02:12] <gunfus> doing ./configure I am seeing "checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
[02:12] <funkyHat> Anyone got Murrine to work? :( won't work here
[02:12] <gunfus> what does that mean?
[02:12] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell gunfus about build-essential | gunfus, you have a private message from Ubotu
[02:13] <gunfus> how to resolve it?
[02:13] <Gertoly> let's say the hdd is unformated and never been formatted. You do fdisk -> mount -> dd right?
[02:13] <Lovloss> hmm... wmv files are a restricted format of their own huh
[02:13] <graham> luci3n i have my windows install cd but what do i do to install the drivers??
[02:13] <gunfus> LjL: Thanks
[02:13] <Anderson> w3ccv, Thanks.
[02:13] <zircx> hey guys, question, has anyone installed vmware successfully and had it fully operational, I know vmware player is available but that requires a windows image file doesn't it? you can't actually install windows using the vmware player can you?
[02:13] <funkyHat> Oops.. wrong channel :/
[02:13] <^Ocean^> is it possible to tell whats useing a port on my computer, what process...  im trying to run something but its saying ports already in use
[02:13] <LjL> zircx: you can.
[02:13] <graham> luci3n :) you should be a I.T technical support worker
[02:13] <Luci3n> graham insert the CD and look for the correct .inf file
[02:13] <Lovloss> let me get this straight. Linux has to not come with restricted format support because that would be potentially making profit using them, so you have to install them personally... right?
[02:13] <LjL> zircx: http://www.easyvmx.com is just one way to create virtual machines for vmware
[02:13] <zircx> aha
[02:13] <graham> luci3n how do i find the correct one?
[02:13] <Luci3n> graham no thanks i'm a software manager
[02:13] <protolnx> does any one konw the channel for eternal lands
[02:13] <protolnx> ?
[02:14] <marltu> zircx: i've launched ubuntu in VM
[02:14] <Gertoly> Lovloss: for wmv?
[02:14] <Luci3n> graham trial and error
[02:14] <protolnx> can I play it single player?
[02:14] <LjL> Lovloss: no, it's because of patents. and it's not "Linux", it's "Ubuntu"
[02:14] <Lovloss> ya
[02:14] <murph2481> is there a way to get sound juicer to connect to CDDB for Audio CD Information?
[02:14] <graham> luci3n i guess that is a better job lol
[02:14] <Lovloss> right ubuntu
[02:14] <paradox> What is the terminal command to create a new folder?
[02:14] <zircx> marltu, yeah i want to install this XP Lite on vmware to see how it pans out ..
[02:14] <marltu> zircx: if you want, you can ask in private or i go sleep
[02:14] <LjL> paradox: mkdir
[02:14] <Gertoly> you mean other distros don't have that limitation?
[02:14] <paradox> LjL, thanks :)
[02:14] <marltu> xp lite?
[02:14] <LjL> Gertoly: yes. i guess most of them today do, though, everybody's scared of being sued
[02:15] <Luci3n> graham you know ndiswrapper is used for wireless connection using windows drivers
[02:15] <graham> luci3n what would happen if i were to install all of the .inf files on the cd?
[02:15] <Lovloss> then its linux :D
[02:15] <zircx> marltu, I'm all ears..
[02:15] <protolnx> anyone know the channel for eternal lands/
[02:15] <murph2481> is there a way to get sound juicer to connect to CDDB for Audio CD Information?
[02:15] <Gertoly> but there is still "ways" correct?
[02:15] <LjL> Lovloss: no, linux is just a kernel, it doesn't concern itself in the least with what is distributed and in which repositories etc
[02:15] <graham> luci3n well i know it is now i had no clue before you told me lmao
[02:15] <Luci3n> graham i don't know one should work at least probably more
[02:15] <Lovloss> okie then
[02:16] <Lovloss> i have to go guys, got a lot more copying to do
[02:16] <Lovloss> thanks for all your hlep as usual
[02:16] <graham> luci3n be back in a few moments i am going to try to get this to work
[02:16] <redDEADresolve> how do i get to the beryl channel
[02:16] <Luci3n> graham i'm about to get some zzz
[02:16] <w3ccv> I'm a new Edgy Eft user, the network device manager GUI recognizes my LinkSYS PCMCIA nic, and will connect to my home AP if it is in OPEN mode. But I cannot connect in 128bit WEP mode, hmmm!  How??
[02:16] <marltu> zircx: that's some hacked XP version ?:)
[02:16] <graham> luci3n thankyou for your help very mutch appreciated
[02:16] <grndslm> redDEADresolve:  type in "/join #beryl"
[02:16] <graham> have you a msn hotmail account??
[02:17] <Luci3n> graham once you install the driver make sure you connect to the correct DNS server 192.160.0.1 normally
[02:17] <zircx> marltu, yes, bare minimal, it's had majority of it taken out ..
[02:17] <Luci3n> graham no problem hope it works ok
[02:17] <zircx> it's very bare bones, only 295mb of windows XP pro updated
[02:17] <marltu> zircx: so where's the problem? can't make iso?
[02:17] <Luci3n> graham thats 192.168.0.1 sorry typo
[02:17] <zircx> http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3464748&page=5
[02:17] <Luci3n> graham yes
[02:18] <zircx> no I have the iso.. but I have only installed vmware player from the respositories
[02:18] <zircx> it doesn't install the actual full workstation for vmware
[02:18] <pestilence> does anybody know if the internal bluetooth that dell sells (version 355) works in ubuntu?
[02:18] <graham> luci3n ok thank you, I would like too keep in touch for further help if that is ok and i can let you know how i go
[02:18] <pestilence> in particular, bluetooth mice
[02:18] <ezenu> isn't kernel-generic new with Edgy? What does it mean? should I stop using linux-k7? since upgrading to edgy made it so fglrx drivers don't load.
[02:19] <graham> luci3n if you have a hotmail account
[02:19] <Luci3n> graham ok i'll be here tomorrow daytime or definately the night

[02:20] <Luci3n> graham no probs good luck
[02:20] <^Ocean^> is it possible to tell whats useing a port on my computer, what process...  im trying to run something but its saying ports already in use
[02:20] <zircx> brainless, wasn't thinking.. doh..I think it's the opensource mentality.. you tend to think everything is free when it aint..
[02:21] <murph2481> murph2481
[02:21] <zircx> ok, I think I'll go and find out what VMX does..
[02:21] <h00t> can anyone tell me how can i see certain packages I have installed ... something like --dpkg-selection but with wildcards and searching
[02:21] <LjL> h00t: can't you use dpkg --get-selections and grep?
[02:21] <LjL> h00t: like dpkg --get-selections | grep somepackagename
[02:22] <LjL> anyway i'm sure dpkg has some option for that
[02:22] <iwkse> h00t: ahh, you're back here lol..you wasn't so nice with me in #gnome...you little asshole
[02:22] <NigelS> h00t: you mean like dpkg -l \*package\*

[02:26] <LjL> gunfus, have you installed build-essential yet? the library you need seems to be in there
[02:26] <Hobbsee> LjL: more bots?
[02:26] <gunfus> LjL:  no.. the page never said to install it
[02:26] <gunfus> ohh sorry it did
[02:26] <gunfus> hehe
[02:27] <gunfus> I just missed that first paragraph
=== mark__ is now known as icepack
[02:27] <LjL> gunfus: it's the most important thing that it says ;)
[02:28] <gunfus> yeah.. I reckon.. that.. but I tend to skim through first paragraph really really fast
[02:28] <gunfus> first pargraph are intros
[02:28] <LjL> heh not always
[02:28] <gunfus> LjL: I figure heheh
[02:29] <grndslm> after a "modprobe dri", i'm getting a:  "FATAL: Module dri not found"...how do i install it??  all the xserver-xorg-video-i810 and intel drivers are installed
[02:29] <gunfus> LjL: Sorry about that dude
[02:29] <LjL> gunfus: np
[02:29] <gunfus> LjL: Things are working fine noe.. :D
[02:29] <zircx> well spank me with a wooden-damn-spoon.. that was easy than I thought..
[02:29] <Cpudan80> Ok everybody - need some help
[02:29] <zircx> actually, that was too bloody easy ..
[02:30] <Cpudan80> I am a Suse 10.1 user
[02:30] <Cpudan80> but -- Suse has been misbehaving lately...
[02:30] <LjL> zircx: then try compiling qemu from scratch and getting the kqemu module to work intstead
[02:30] <Cpudan80> I am thinking of switching to a different distro...
[02:30] <iwkse> Cpudan80: :)
[02:30] <apokryphos> misbehaving?
[02:30] <icepack> how has suse been misbehaving
[02:30] <Cpudan80> hmm - well - it wont wake-on-lan
[02:30] <zircx> LjL, is that a little more difficult, I've used qemu before but it was a little slow, I was just surprised how simple it was to create that virtual block to do an install for player..
[02:31] <Cpudan80> Its built in package manager that I uninstalled keeps reappearing....
[02:31] <iwkse> icepack: ..giving ass to m$
[02:31] <LjL> zircx, i was sarcastic :)
[02:31] <Cpudan80> iwkse: LOL!!!!!
[02:31] <icepack> iwkse: hahah
[02:31] <Cpudan80> Ok - so - I need some advice
[02:31] <zircx> here I was thinking that I was going to have to install the full workstation for vmware
[02:31] <LjL> zircx: it's slow because it emulates the CPU, while vmware uses it natively
[02:31] <Cpudan80> What are some ubuntu pros?
[02:31] <LjL> !ask
[02:31] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:31] <apokryphos> Cpudan80: take a look at http://ubuntu.com :)
[02:32] <Cpudan80> Yeah - I looked there... I am looking for some first hand experience
[02:32] <LjL> zircx: nah, well, workstation gives you some advantages, but the player is fine for a lot of stuff
[02:32] <Cpudan80> Does it support Wake-On-Lan?
[02:32] <Compy> Anyone here good at removing an array or mounting it? Every time I try to mkfs or mount an array it says the resource is busy or inuse yet fuser doesnt return anything on the device nor does mount
[02:32] <Cpudan80> Suse doesn't
[02:32] <apokryphos> Cpudan80: it's all first hand there. The people writing the website use ubuntu :P
[02:32] <Cpudan80> oh - hmm
[02:32] <stalefries> Cpudan80: there's a howto for wakeonlan
[02:32] <apokryphos> Cpudan80: did you ask in the channel there?
[02:32] <Cpudan80> apokryphos: In the suse channel?
[02:32] <Cpudan80> Yes
[02:33] <iter> Cpudan80: all you need to know is apt-get
[02:33] <Cpudan80> They directed me to the Ubuntu tutorial....
[02:33] <iter> Cpudan80: that alone is worth its weight in gold
[02:33] <Cpudan80> apt-get?
[02:33] <Cpudan80> Is that the ubuntu package manager?
[02:33] <iter> yep
[02:33] <iter> it chowns
[02:33] <Cpudan80> Ok -- now - the real question
[02:33] <cheesy> can someone tell me where i can get help for CSS ?
[02:33] <iwkse> Cpudan80: synaptic is similar to yast
[02:33] <Cpudan80> My home dir is on its own partition
[02:33] <apokryphos> cheesy: #css
[02:33] <Cpudan80> Can I format all but that one?
[02:34] <Cpudan80> And not loose the data?
[02:34] <apokryphos> yes
[02:34] <iter> I would save /etc/ too
[02:34] <apokryphos> (as in all distros)
[02:34] <Cpudan80> etc?
[02:34] <Lovloss> im having a problem with "chown -R". For some reason when i run it on this folder, not all the folders inside are affected
[02:34] <Cpudan80> I have nothing in there
[02:34] <iter> hah
[02:34] <iter> I'm pretty sure there is something in /etc
[02:34] <Lovloss> "sudo chown -R lovloss /home/lovloss/Desktop/b" should do it right?
[02:34] <rioghal> Lovloss, what is the exact comand youre using?
[02:34] <Lovloss> thats the command
[02:35] <Lovloss> the folder is b, it sits on my desktop
[02:35] <grndslm> after a "modprobe dri", i'm getting a:  "FATAL: Module dri not found"...how do i install it??  the xserver-xorg-video-i810, the xserver-xorg-video-intel, and the libgl1-mesa-dri packages are all installed
[02:36] <rioghal> Lovloss, try: sudo chown -R lovloss:lovloss /home/lovloss/Desktop/b
[02:36] <cheesy> thanks apokryphos
[02:36] <green_earz> cheesy: http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/structure.html#pseudo
[02:36] <CheWaka> somebody speak spanish?
[02:36] <Lovloss> still says i dont have permissions
[02:36] <iwkse> huh..grndalm...so yo have a intel 915GM card..casually?

[02:38] <darkbishop> what is the player tat i can u to play real player file?
[02:38] <CheWaka> thks
[02:38] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell darkbishop about realplayer | darkbishop, you have a private message from Ubotu
[02:38] <Lovloss> isnt that bizarre rioghal ?
[02:39] <Lovloss> its worked before
[02:39] <rioghal> Lovloss, yes, that has always worked for me.. i dont understand it
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: you didn't mess around with 'chattr' did you?  try running lsattr on the files that didn't change
[02:39] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: compare the output with a 'normal' file
[02:40] <stelt> Where's the hash to check the ISO with?
[02:40] <Lovloss> i didnt touch chattr or even know what it is.
[02:40] <Lovloss> what the!
[02:40] <zircx> erm , damn it's burning all my cpu
[02:40] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: for a plain file, lsattr should output all dashes
[02:40] <bimberi> stelt: md5sum's are availabe at the download page
[02:40] <Cpudan80_> Alright -- sorry about dropping out
[02:40] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: if you see anything else there, it has special attributes
[02:40] <Lovloss> i did it with a simple permission change outside of root
[02:40] <Cpudan80_> My power went out
[02:40] <Cpudan80_> Thank you dominion power
[02:40] <Lovloss> i just selected everything , went to permissions and changed "read only" to "read and write"
[02:41] <murph2481> is there a way to get sound juicer to connect to CDDB for Audio CD Information?
[02:41] <Lovloss> and all the locks went away
[02:41] <Cpudan80_> Ok - a couple other questions
[02:41] <Cpudan80_> 1: Does ubuntu support VNC (as a built in thing like Suse?)
[02:41] <Cpudan80_> 2: Why is the distro only one CD? Suse's was 5?
[02:41] <rioghal> i cant get over how nice this window manager looks.. thanks to whomever packaged it for ubuntu 
[02:42] <Pelo> Cpudan80,  the distro isn'T one cd it's 7 cd , or 1 dvd,  but you can install from the first cd and get the rest online
[02:42] <LjL> Cpudan80_: there is a VNC client shipped by default, and also a VNC server that shares your user's desktop
[02:42] <Lovloss> now how can i chown so that the folders inside wont just change permissions to me, but also allow reading and writing?
[02:42] <Cpudan80_> ok thanks
[02:42] <simmerz> has anyone got a prism 3 card working with ubuntu and psk? I can only seem to get it to deal with WEP
[02:42] <Lovloss> they changed the owner to me, but as "access files"
[02:43] <ladydoor> so I was wondering two things: (1) is it possible to install the gnus from the repos, but only have it compile itself for emacs, not xemacs (i have both installed at present, so as to try out xemacs for a change)
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: you want permissions for who for read/write, for any user?
[02:43] <Lovloss> well im the only user
[02:43] <Lovloss> so... lovloss is fine
[02:43] <Cpudan80_> ok -- well unless Suse decides to behave itself - quick - I will move over
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: o.k.   chmod 644 file.txt  makes that file read/write for you
[02:43] <slicky> are there any linux warez torrent sites where i can get the latest version of Cedega ?
[02:43] <rioghal> Lovloss, you need chmod: chmod -R a+rw  will make it readable/writable (rw) to everyone (a)
[02:43] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: and readable for anyone else
[02:44] <icepack> slicky: btjunkie.com
[02:44] <ladydoor> (2) does the dapper->edgy upgrade work in X, and if so, do i need to stop my applications (screen, xterm, emacs) in order to successfully perform it?
[02:44] <simmerz> is it the hardware that doesn't support wpa or is it software?
[02:44] <zircx> chown and permissions are two different things
[02:44] <Lovloss> woah woah... so what would be an example of the command i might run on this folder to recursively change those permissions?
[02:44] <Lovloss> because thats all confusing looking @.@
[02:44] <slicky> icepack: thanks
[02:44] <simmerz> Lovloss: chmod -R a+rw
[02:44] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: are there subdirectories or just files?
[02:44] <Pelo> ladydoor,  the update didn'T work well for me ( and a few others)  I recommend a back up of the home folder and a fresh install
[02:45] <Lovloss> subdirectories by the ton
[02:45] <Lovloss> ok let me try...
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: o.k. you need to do this    find /path/to/b -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
=== Alethes_ is now known as Alethes
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: that fixes dirs
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: o.k. you need to do this    find /path/to/b -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
[02:45] <ladydoor> Pelo: well, i've got a separate /home partition...i was hoping to avoid a fresh install because it's a lot of work to get a usable system after a fresh install
[02:45] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: that fixes the files
[02:45] <ladydoor> *for me
[02:46] <Lovloss> actually
[02:46] <ladydoor> Pelo: do you know if it's possible to somehow make a record of what's installed at present (from the repos at any rate, i've got the source end covered) and just have apt install all that?
[02:46] <Lovloss> chmod -R a+rw /home/lovloss/Desktop/b   worked
[02:46] <Pelo> ladydoor,  I'm a bit of a noob (6 months) this was my first update and it screwed up,  you may be able to get it to work right, also enough ppl have had problems they may have fixed it
[02:46] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: except it isn't the same effect, just note that
[02:47] <Lovloss> what do you mean?
[02:47] <ladydoor> Pelo: fair enough. thanks anyway!
[02:47] <Pelo> ladydoor,  to answer your latest question,  I don'T know
[02:47] <Kingsqueak> dir permissions are something you need to thing about a bit differently at times
[02:47] <malt> anyone know any dynamic dns clients that works with ubuntu linux with domain register namecheap.com?
[02:47] <Lovloss> but i can access all the files now
[02:48] <simmerz> Kingsqueak: assuming the directories are already rwxr-xr-x (755) then a+rw will fix the files so that they can be accessed
[02:48] <NigelS> ladydoor: dpkg -l | grep ii will output all currently installed packages
[02:48] <simmerz> depending on your security, you may want u+rw or g+rw instead.
[02:48] <Lovloss> i already made the folders accessible with chown
[02:48] <Aragorn> hi at all!
[02:48] <Kingsqueak> simmerz: a+rw allows anyone to rwx that dir right?
[02:48] <green_earz> malt: aptitude show no-ip
[02:48] <simmerz> Kingsqueak: only rw, but dirs are by default +x
[02:48] <zircx> Lovloss, , Kingsqueak is providing you with the correct syntax for proper permissions, the files are much different to folder permissions
[02:49] <Lovloss> but Kingsqueak, they are set with *me* as owner
[02:49] <Kingsqueak> simmerz: right so other users can create files in his dir now, that was all the point I was making
[02:49] <Aragorn> can anyone help me with the configuration of a router?
[02:49] <green_earz> malt: http://www.no-ip.com/
[02:49] <simmerz> Kingsqueak: with 777 on the dirs and 666 on the files, yes.
[02:49] <Lovloss> but your right, it seems anyone can access my files
[02:49] <Kingsqueak> simmerz: it's just sloppier
[02:49] <malt> green_earz: i already have a domain
[02:49] <zircx> Lovloss, directories and files permission wise should be treated differently..
[02:49] <Lovloss> im confused
[02:50] <Kingsqueak> simmerz: no doubt it works, just not the , erm best discipline to get in a habit of
[02:50] <simmerz> Lovloss, you actually want to chmod -R o-w now to remove world access
[02:50] <simmerz> Kingsqueak: indeed
[02:50] <Kingsqueak> I deal with developers all day that never learned permissions ;-)
[02:50] <gdb> Directories need execute (+x) in order to be able to enter them.
[02:50] <zircx> for security wise i'd run with Kingsqueak's syntax, for generic i'd run with simmerz
[02:50] <green_earz> malt: you can use your own domain at no-ip
[02:51] <simmerz> Lovloss, if you also want to stop members of your user group associated with the files from writing, you should use g-w (you can join the two together with chmod -R og-w
[02:51] <iwkse> After i saw this http://youtube.com/watch?v=G3p8IBNNd88
[02:51] <iwkse> maybe i'll install beryl..:)

[02:51] <simmerz> if you want to stop them reading as well, add a 'r' after the -
[02:51] <ladydoor> NigelS: interesting...could i then somehow use that to get apt-get to install all of those?
[02:51] <Lovloss> well right now only my login an access the files
[02:51] <Lovloss> the -R o-w worked
[02:52] <Lovloss> Just fyi guys, im the only one accessing this machine. security = hackers
[02:52] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: all that babbling was that basically all the options are 'right' if you want what they produced ;-)
[02:52] <Kingsqueak> Lovloss: play with permissions just to get used to them
[02:52] <Lovloss> okay
[02:52] <Lovloss> i think its fine now. For non-lovloss people it says 'list files only'
[02:52] <LjL> Lovloss, *in your home directory*, not randomly in the filesystem
[02:52] <green_earz> malt: the no-ip client should be in your package list, apt-cache search no-ip
[02:52] <Kingsqueak> LjL: lol yeah, thanks, good point
[02:53] <Lovloss> i didnt mess with my file system, dont worry ^_^
[02:53] <Lovloss> chown /   would do some bad stuff huh
[02:53] <malt> green_earz: nope
[02:53] <malt> green_earz: I didn't find nothing
[02:54] <malt> malt@malt-server:~$ apt-cache search no-ip
[02:54] <malt> malt@malt-server:~$
[02:54] <beasty> lol
[02:54] <icepack> malt: sources updated?
[02:54] <Lovloss> I stay away form anything outside of /home unless its under /media when im looking at another unmounted drive
[02:54] <Lovloss> and at that point i mount it
[02:54] <zircx> Lovloss, it's just a good proper habits to get use to, it's like washing your hands after you take a piss and eating food afterwards.. some people would take a piss with food in their mouths others would wash first , not dry and then eat, whilst the proper way to go about it would be to, eat first, then take a piss and then dry your hands properly.. it's just good practice for doing things correctly the first time
[02:54] <Lovloss> seems to me that's a good rule of thumb
[02:55] <malt> icepack: should be, i runned the upgrade command and update
[02:55] <Lovloss> got you, thanks =)
[02:55] <Lovloss> bye guys, thansk again! ^_^

[02:59] <soulfire41> Is there a reason that causes the cd install to say the cd cannot be used for the install?

[03:02] <confusco> can anybody tell me why I'm getting an "Authentication required" dialog box accessing a Windows share on the network, even though there is no password set? what do I do?
[03:02] <Frankle> can I paste an image here? My ubuntu becomes unresponsive at what seems to be at the desktop

[03:03] <Frankle> This is running ubuntu from DVD, I've not yet been able to install as it becomes un responsive there

[03:04] <simmerz> could be any number of things! ranging from a dodgy dvd burn, to iffy memory

[03:07] <simmerz> txx2: have you tried running X --config as root?
[03:08] <txx2> simmerz,  I'm currently using mepis becaue I'm basically locked out of ubuntu. I edited the xorg.conf and it kicks me out every time.
[03:08] <simmerz> txx2: what are the errors?
[03:08] <Frankle> Any idea if using it on a DVD could cause it to become unresponsive?
[03:08] <Stormx2>  UUID=44A6-9501 /media/Stuff vfat defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0 1 <-- in /etc/fstab. I want this to be world writeable (at the moment the permissions are drwxrwx--- ). How do i change this line to reflect this?

[03:08] <txx2> simmerz,  can't remember, but I get a blue box in the middle saying that something has gone wrong
[03:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about audigy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:08] <simmerz> best thing to do is to pastebin your xorg.conf file and let someone help you fix it. i doubt its a major thing

[03:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about audgiy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:09] <simmerz> txx2: need to know that "something
[03:09] <ladydoor> Stormx2: change umask to 000 or 111 (111 if you don't want any execute permissions)
[03:09] <txx2> it's about the xorg/video
[03:09] <w3ccv> txx2:  I've got a file ready
[03:09] <Stormx2> ladydoor: Thanks.
[03:09] <gop> how come I am getting NO sound
[03:09] <simmerz> txx2: look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[03:09] <ladydoor> Stormx2: umask is kind of the opposite of chmod as far as the numbering system goes
[03:09] <gop> from my sound card a creative audigy card
[03:09] <ladydoor> Stormx2: np
[03:09] <txx2> simmerz,  for some strange reason, mepis doesn't like mounting ubuntu
[03:09] <Stormx2> ladydoor: heh okay. Then mount -d right?
[03:10] <ladydoor> Stormx2: i guess so
[03:10] <simmerz> txx2: is ubuntu installed on an ext3 partition?
[03:10] <Stormx2> ladydoor: Oh I think its  -a
[03:10] <txx2> w3ccv,  could you host this temporarily?.. (the file) looks like it's not going to send. Sorry for the trouble.
[03:10] <txx2> simmerz,  yeah
[03:10] <simmerz> txx2: mount -t ext3 /dev/hdX /mnt/ubuntu (or wherever)
[03:11] <simmerz> txx2: if you're using SATA then /dev/sdX
[03:11] <ladydoor> Stormx2: i honestly haven't looked at the manual in a while, but that's probably it. skimming just now i didn't see a -d option at all
[03:11] <simmerz> and that will give you access to the drive
[03:11] <txx2> simmerz,  using laptop, it's ide.
[03:11] <simmerz> txx2: ok. so probably hda1 then
[03:12] <Stormx2> ladydoor: Still no good.
[03:12] <txx2> it keeps saying "mount: mount point /mnt/ubuntu does not exist

[03:14] <simmerz> 007 means that all 7 bits of the mask are removed.
[03:14] <Pelo> tensor,  if you are talkinga bout the swap , don't mess with it , it is very usefull

[03:22] <txx2> I am not sure, but as it starts to load.. about 5 seconds in on the black loading screen, it haults then says something about restarting. If you want I can go try it again and take down the stuff it says to me

[03:23] <confusco> does anybody have an idea why my game is running slow? I've installed the nvidia driver correctly and direct rendering is on.
[03:23] <Novagenesis> hello...got a minor worry...just wanna make sure the world won't end
[03:23] <Novagenesis> I can't get into linux (any distro) without using the noapic boot option
[03:23] <Novagenesis> i'm currently installing ubuntu
[03:23] <Novagenesis> should I do anything to resolve this....is this a big deal?
[03:24] <Novagenesis> i have a very new motherboard, budget high-end Abit
[03:24] <cheatersrealm> can you use the edgy livecd to install with raid?
[03:24] <cheatersrealm> (software)
[03:25] <Novagenesis> I have googled alot and haven't found a solid answer to noapic problems
[03:25] <simmerz> Novagenesis: just add it to your grub line after the install
[03:25] <Novagenesis> simmerz: yeah, but i mean, is that safe? is there a cost to doing that?
[03:25] <Novagenesis> I don't know what APIC is to know if it's a big deal
[03:25] <Beryllium> What's Ubuntu's GUI package manager called?
[03:25] <LjL> Beryllium: Synaptic
[03:25] <Novagenesis> Beryllium:  Syn....what Ljl said
[03:25] <markstos> Novagenesis: ACPI is a power management system, most useful on laptops.
[03:26] <Pelo> Beryllium,  gtk ?
[03:26] <Pelo> oh, nvm
[03:26] <LjL> :)
[03:26] <Novagenesis> oh, I take it that there's no need for it on a Desktop then! woohoo
[03:26] <Beryllium> could someone do a quick check and see if it has Stanford's Folding client there? I have a friend in a far away land who is trying to learn Ubuntu, and I don
[03:26] <Beryllium> I don't  have much experience with it
[03:26] <markstos> Novagenesis: It's not necessary. 'apm' can also be used, or neither on a desktop or server.
[03:26] <Pelo> Beryllium,   no experience necessary
[03:26] <simmerz> Novagenesis: not that i know of. best is to google it.
[03:27] <Pelo> Beryllium,  system > admin > synaptic
[03:27] <Novagenesis> ok, problem 2 on my list is that I installed nvidia, and nvidia read as the driver... nvidia's manager tools worked just fine...but i wasn't getting any accelleration for my 7600 GT OC card
[03:27] <Novagenesis> i can't do much re: that anyway because i'm mid-install for a fresh start (so sue me, I tried suse a bit, and flopped worse)
[03:27] <Beryllium> thank you pelo :)
[03:27] <markstos> Beryllium: For basic app installs, "gnome-app-install" is simpler and nicer, and also installed by default.
[03:27] <Beryllium> synaptic isn't installed by default?
[03:28] <markstos> Beryllium: They both are.
[03:28] <Beryllium> awesome :) thanks
[03:28] <markstos> gnome-app-install is simpler and easier. synaptic is advanced.
[03:28] <Novagenesis> anyone know what's up when proprietary nvidia drivers are flashing the logo, and running X, but no accelleration is occuring?
[03:28] <Novagenesis> ftr, I used automatix to install them
[03:29] <Pelo> Beryllium,  the only real diff is that gnome app is a bit more noob orientted while synaptic list all indivitual packages
[03:29] <Beryllium> Novagenesis: Perchance, are you running an oddly-designated chipset? Like a mobile one, or an OEM one?
[03:29] <Novagenesis> neither... BFG standard 7600 GT OC
[03:29] <gop> hey
[03:29] <Novagenesis> maybe the OC is an issue?
[03:30] <simmerz> Novagenesis: you may need to set RenderAccel to true in xorg.conf
[03:30] <gop> how come I get no sound via my sound card pci audigy card
[03:30] <Beryllium> The OC sucks. I can't watch that show.
[03:30] <Novagenesis> ok, i'll give that a try soon as i got the install done and run automatix for it
[03:30] <Pelo> Beryllium,  yeah you sound more like a "one tree hill" kind of guy
[03:31] <Beryllium> try "The Unit"
[03:31] <Beryllium> or, for that matter, "Dexter"
[03:31] <Novagenesis> Beryllium: for that matter, I don't know any of those shows...just realize dyou're talking tv....I don't watch tv :)
[03:31] <gop> I get no sound what so ever
[03:31] <Pelo> I'll confess to finding dexter oddly entertaining
[03:31] <simmerz> Novagenesis: there may be some others, worth reading the nvidia release notes and docs
[03:31] <Milos_SD> hello all...
[03:31] <Novagenesis> simmerz: good point
[03:31] <Novagenesis> ill confess to finding Neurotically Yours very entertaining
[03:31] <dope> how do i give my login root permissions
[03:32] <Beryllium> Pelo: One of the most hilarious things about the show is that the opening credits tend to disturb me on a far deeper level than the episode content itself.
[03:32] <mcrandello> dope: sudo -i in a console
[03:32] <gop> !sound
[03:32] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[03:32] <mcrandello> dope: type exit when you are done
[03:32] <dope> well how do i make it always have root permissions
[03:32] <Milos_SD> why all drop down menu are behind flash when viewing web page in linux?
[03:32] <dope> so i'm not typing sudo apt-get install * all the time
[03:32] <mcrandello> create a root login and login as root :)
[03:32] <dope> i can't give my login root?
[03:33] <mcrandello> sudo -i will work until you type exit
[03:33] <dope> yea i know
[03:33] <mcrandello> so you don't have to type sudo at all after that
[03:33] <Milos_SD> I have that problem even on adobe.com web site...
[03:33] <preaction> dope, the idea is you don't WANT your normal users to have root permissions always...
[03:33] <Novagenesis> there's a faq somewhere...i have no clue where, but I kinda like it this way..easy to keep from screwing up
[03:33] <Lovloss> hmm, how can i get access to gparted?
[03:33] <dope> oh
[03:33] <dope> :/
[03:33] <mcrandello> also (dangerous) add you to the root, sudo and I think shadow dirs and you'll never have to type a password again
[03:33] <mcrandello> s/dirs/groups
[03:34] <confusco> does anybody have an idea why my game is running slow? I've installed the nvidia driver correctly and direct rendering is on.
[03:34] <mcrandello> you'll still have to type sudo but it won't bug you for a password
[03:34] <Milos_SD> anyone?
[03:34] <dope> why's it dangerous?
[03:34] <Lovloss> i thought you could run gparted without the live cd
[03:34] <bimberi> dope: It's a good idea to get used to sudo.  It means better security and less chance of stuffups.
[03:34] <Novagenesis> confusco: have you tested glxgears to see if you're actually using accelleration?
[03:34] <preaction> dope, because now anybody can open a terminal and type "sudo rm -rf /"
[03:34] <Novagenesis> confusco: then, what game is "my game"?
[03:34] <mcrandello> what bimberi said
[03:34] <confusco> yes I have
[03:34] <mcrandello> personally I like to live dangerously
[03:34] <dope> hm
[03:34] <confusco> at least, I think
[03:35] <confusco> game: Tribes 2
[03:35] <Novagenesis> confusco: what game is it?
[03:35] <cheatersrealm> not everyone can do that, it's the sudoers file that handles it
[03:35] <Pahalial> Question: Upon selecting a LAMP server installation, will I be prompted as to whether I want to install such things as samba during the installation, or would that need to be done afterwards?
[03:35] <Novagenesis> confusco: ok, what're you running it througH? is it linux native?
[03:35] <confusco> native
[03:35] <Jordan_U> dope: If you run a program it can do whatever it wants, not running as root is the main reason ( although there are many others ) that linux is secure and windows has viruses.
[03:35] <mcrandello> although it would be irresponsible to give advice that could hose your box without warning you
[03:35] <dope> can the tar command unarchieve zip files?
[03:35] <luca> hi everyone
[03:35] <Milos_SD> why all drop down menu's are behind flash when viewing web page in linux?
[03:35] <bimberi> Pahalial: afterwards (i'm fairly sure)
[03:35] <luca> is there a channel for webcam support?
[03:36] <Pahalial> alright, thanks bimberi
[03:36] <preaction> dope, it can unarchive gz and bz files
[03:36] <Novagenesis> poor, poor linux, so ignored on the virus front... everyone, always use root...think of the poor VIRUSES
[03:36] <dope> is there a way to unzip zip files in linux?
[03:36] <Novagenesis> sorry :) I"m buggin while ubuntu installs
[03:36] <preaction> dope, yes, sudo apt-get install unzip
[03:36] <Jordan_U> !zip | dope
[03:36] <ubotu> dope: Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde) - also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
[03:36] <mcrandello> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1782430 <<-- anyone ever see this one before? I have the same problem
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> unzip
[03:36] <dope> ok cool thx
[03:36] <bimberi> Novagenesis: lol
[03:36] <mcrandello> dope there's also an unzip command from the command line that will do it
[03:36] <luca> sudo apt-get install ark
[03:37] <Jordan_U> dope: Or just double click the .zip file :)
[03:37] <luca> mcrandello: why using command line when there are nice GUI programs? :D
[03:37] <dope> oh
[03:37] <dope> haha ok thx yall
[03:37] <luca> or right click - Extract ;-)
[03:37] <jonduf_> hi
[03:37] <Novagenesis> luca: why use GUI programs when a commandline is faster?
[03:38] <mcrandello> luca: I try not to use ark, I called a boycott when it started puking on rar files using d&d
[03:38] <jonduf_> does anyone know how to use the python bindings of gnome-vte? I can't find documentation for it anywhere
[03:38] <luca> is there a channel for webcam support by the way?
[03:38] <dope> is there a way to setup the gmail web interface as my default mail client?
[03:38] <confusco> no, not faster
[03:38] <luca> mcrandello: what do you mean?
[03:38] <Jordan_U> luca: Not that I know of, here is probably your best bet.
[03:38] <luca> Novagenesis: I know they are faster, but eye wants its part
[03:38] <mcrandello> luca, open a rar file, drag the contents to the desktop, cleanup on aisle ark
[03:39] <Milos_SD> Question: why all drop down menu's are behind flash when viewing web page in linux? I don't have that problem in windows... :(
[03:39] <Zweideutig> Does Ubuntu's installer use X11?
[03:39] <mcrandello> luca, it says something about the clipboard being empty
[03:39] <liquidboy> how do i find out what processor i have? i know i'ts an amd, but nothing else
[03:39] <luca> Milos_SD: have you installed flash player beta 9?
[03:39] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: Flash 7 or flash 9 ?
[03:39] <Zweideutig> Does Ubuntu's installer use ncurses?
[03:39] <bimberi> dope: i very much doubt it, you can use configure mail clients to work with gmail though
[03:39] <bimberi> liquidboy: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[03:40] <Novagenesis> Zweideutig: Actually, I just installed ubuntu from Gnome while chatting in this very room...
[03:40] <Milos_SD> luca, yes a have
[03:40] <luca> mcrandello: gimme a sec, I do *not* have any rar files with me on this pc! :D
[03:40] <dope> hm ok
[03:40] <Lovloss> i tried qtparted and it couldnt find anything but my working drive
[03:40] <luca> Milos_SD: I have not noticed anything, I cannot help you I fear :(
[03:40] <Frankle> I just ran the disc check, everything is fine
[03:40] <Milos_SD> Jordan_U, flash 7 (opera)and flash 9 beta 2 (firefox 1.5 and 2)
[03:40] <Novagenesis> speaking of live cds and the like...i will be back..have to reboot
[03:40] <Lovloss> i want to re-partition one of my internal drives
[03:40] <mcrandello> seriously though I think this is a bug in k3d, maybe needs some field in the deb or something to get by pycentral
[03:40] <Zweideutig> How graphical is the Ubuntu installer?
[03:40] <bimberi> Zweideutig: the Desktop installer uses python/gnome, alternate is text based - not sure if its ncurses though
[03:40] <Frankle> I also tried to boot with the safe graphics mode, still distorts the graphics and becomes un responsive
[03:40] <liquidboy> bimberi, sweet, cheers
[03:40] <Lovloss> completely graphical
[03:41] <mcrandello> Zweideutig: it's a liveCD with an install icon on the desktop, that graphical :)
[03:41] <bimberi> liquidboy: np :)
[03:41] <cento> hi
[03:41] <lakcaj> Zweideutig, there's a "live install" on the CD that most people will download, but if you download the ubuntu alternate CD, then it will be ncurses
[03:41] <bimberi> Zweideutig: graphical and only 6 steps
[03:41] <PMantis> Hello. I just build a new Ubuntu 6.10 server. I rebooted, and it just sits there, without starting any services. It took 10 minutes for me to login!
[03:42] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: It's Beta, they are probably trying to do direct rendering but don't know how to do it properly, the flash people scare me with their lack of knowlage when it comes to linux...
[03:43] <Milos_SD> but why flash 7 don't work ? it is final version, not beta :)
[03:43] <Jordan_U> Zweideutig: There is also an Alternate ncurses install option though.
[03:44] <Novagenesis> back..not sure if this is the nick I used, or not though
[03:44] <Frankle> grr
[03:44] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: For the same reason sound doesn't sync in flash 7 even though it is final, the flash devs are incompetent.
[03:44] <Frankle> ubuntu have problems with nvidia?
[03:44] <Lovloss> i keep thinking i have it figured out
[03:44] <bipolar> does anyone know what happened to the 'radeon' driver in Edgy?
[03:44] <bipolar> not fglrx, the open source radeon driver...
[03:44] <Lovloss> Guys, seriously, i want to edit the partition on an internal drive that is not mounted logically. Can i do it like i did with gparted on the install disk?
[03:44] <bipolar> is it wrapped up in 'ati' now?
[03:44] <Milos_SD> Jordan_U, I don't have any sound problem with flash... youtube works perfectly :)
[03:44] <Jordan_U> Frankle: No, how did you try to install the drivers?
[03:45] <Novagenesis> is automatix the best way to get nvidia set up?
[03:45] <luca> sorry went offline
[03:45] <Milos_SD> a have problem with drop down menu over flash
[03:45] <Milos_SD> :)
[03:45] <GionnyBoss> I have just installed Ubuntu... I had Fedora Core 5 before... and Ubuntu is quite different... can anybody help me settings all the things in the right way, please?
[03:45] <slicky> anyone know why the make thingy stops when i try to install WineCVS ?  the howto says that i have to install flex-old to solve the problem.. but i have done that.. and ii still get a err msg
[03:45] <luca> in any case, no pm for me, I am not registered yet
[03:45] <Frankle> I havent had a chance to install anything, it locks up the second it gets to the desktop after I run ubuntu
[03:45] <projkt4> hi, i cant get totem to play files over the network, i get cannot read from resource
[03:45] <bimberi> !nvidia
[03:45] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:45] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: But it isn't in synch in flash 7 , that is a fact, it doesn't work anywhere.
[03:45] <stalefries> !anybody | GionnyBoss
[03:45] <ubotu> GionnyBoss: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:45] <Frankle> the graphic it shows is garbled
[03:45] <Frankle> I get mouse movment, that's all
[03:45] <Lovloss> there's an nvidia patch in the add/remove programs
[03:45] <projkt4> do i have to do the windows equivilent of mapping a drive?
[03:46] <slicky> !anybody | WineCVS
[03:46] <ubotu> WineCVS: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:46] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: They have fixed that in fash 9 though.
[03:46] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: automaitx is not a really good idea :(
[03:46] <GionnyBoss> ok sorry... I don't know my root password... what is it? with sudo I can use root account, but I'd like to know root password
[03:46] <gennro> ?
[03:46] <mcrandello> GionnyBoss: there isn't one at first
[03:46] <Lovloss> :(~ i wanna repartition my internal harddriiiiive
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> GionnyBoss: there isn't one, if you need a root prompt, just do  sudo -s
[03:46] <bimberi> GionnyBoss: Ubuntu sets everything up in the right way.  You just need to modify your perception :-)
[03:46] <Milos_SD> Jordan_U, what? sound synch, or flash over drop down menu's?
[03:46] <Novagenesis> joejaxx:  thanks for not botspammin like the other person did....so what's particularly wrong with automatix?
[03:46] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: your sudo password is the same thing as your account password
[03:46] <projkt4> does anybody have experiance playing video and audio over their lan?
[03:46] <luca> root password is the same for sudo
[03:46] <Lovloss> but i can only seem to edit my external where linux is
[03:46] <Jordan_U> Milos_SD: Sound synch
[03:47] <mcrandello> GionnyBoss: they discourage using one as well, use gksudo for graphical apps you want to run as root
[03:47] <GionnyBoss> ok sorry... it's just that I'm costumed with Fedora Core and I used to open a terminal and type "su" :P
[03:47] <Milos_SD> :)
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> GionnyBoss: just do sudo -s
[03:47] <luca> well you can
[03:47] <luca> if you abilitate it
[03:47] <mcrandello> GionnyBoss: to becone "root" use sudo -i then put in your own password
[03:48] <GionnyBoss> thanks mcrandello
[03:48] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: it use scripts and things are not packaged right, it can break your system, you might not see it presently but when you go to update or upgrade to a newer release things are going to break it has happened to alot of people with edgy despite the authors little statement about this channel on the website :(
[03:48] <F28> I Love unubtu
[03:48] <txx2> simmerz,  phew...  http://flickr.com/photos/10043466@N00/
[03:48] <paradox34690> hey, i have 2 questions. I'm new to Linux and have no clue what I'm doing just yet. I'm using (or attempting to use) XMMS in my Ubuntu 6.10 installation. Upon trying to open a web link to stream some music, I'm getting an error that says "Totem could not play 'mmsh://bdcast-greatermedia-wmgk-fm.wm.llnwd.net/bdcast_greatermedia_wmgk-fm?MSWMExt=.asf' No URI handler implemented for "mmsh"". How can I fix it?
[03:48] <Milos_SD> i'm not interested in sound synch, I'm interested in flash on web sites over drop down menu's
[03:48] <GionnyBoss> hey guys, you are great... on #fedora channel I didn't have all this help so quickly :)
[03:48] <Novagenesis> joejaxx: fun....guess i still gotta go the way I went in Dapper with my last system
[03:48] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: yeah probably so
[03:48] <Novagenesis> not fond of self-nuyking
[03:48] <luca> paradox, try some other player
[03:48] <luca> I advise kmplayer, mplayer, amarok
[03:49] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: haha yeah me either, i just wish there was a way to educate people about automatix
[03:49] <projkt4> if i wanted to play an .avi that is being shared on my network by a windows pc am i able to play it without having to download it to my pc?
[03:49] <GionnyBoss> another thing... how can I install all plugins for audio-video (mp3, divx) and flash player... and all this stuff? can you suggest me a web page with a tutorial, please?
[03:49] <Who_> paradox: probably :) - have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[03:49] <PMantis> How can I diagnose a S-L-O-W booting Edgy install? It took 25 minutes to give me a login prompt!
[03:49] <projkt4> im using edgy
[03:49] <confusco> does anybody have an idea why my native game(Tribes 2) is running slow(Half FPS of Win). I've installed the nvidia driver correctly and direct rendering is on.
[03:50] <paradox34690> Well, I'm used to using WinAMP, so I'm looking for something that's universal in that aspect.
[03:50] <Novagenesis> ok, here's a question... how solid is 64 bit support? ..i'm on a dual-core Athlon64 in a 386 kernel...should I download the A64 kernel instead?
[03:50] <Novagenesis> paradox34690: xmms
[03:50] <cheesy> paradox34690: xmms
[03:50] <cheesy> :)
[03:50] <Who_> paradox34690: have a look above at what I posted if you missed it :) I got your name wrong
[03:50] <joejaxx> paradox34690: yeah xmms is really close to winamp :)
[03:50] <fourat> how to erase a CD ? not using k3b
[03:50] <Novagenesis> cheesy: jynx you owe me a yoohoo? :)
[03:51] <paradox34690> Nova, Cheesy, all aparently, That's the reason i'm getting that message...
[03:51] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: i do not know as i do not have 64bit pcs well i do but they are old sun sparcstations haha 233mhz
[03:51] <Who_> paradox34690: If you want a player that will play _everything_ you throw at it then you can't go far wrong with VLC
[03:51] <GionnyBoss> I'd like to install nVidia drivers and all codecs and plugins useful for a desktop environment... how can I do it?
[03:51] <Novagenesis> will the system explode on me (software-wise) if I swap kernels from 32 to 64 bit without fully reinstalling?
[03:52] <projkt4> xmms will not play .mp3 files over the network either
[03:52] <projkt4> right now i'm just connecting via smb
[03:52] <wimpies> I am looking for the dbgp debugger client ... is there a package for it ?
[03:52] <paradox34690> hmmm... okay, I'll have to try out VLC then...
[03:52] <paradox34690> thanks guys...
[03:52] <malt> Hello, is it insecure to use dynamic dns clients, where the information is in config of the domain?
[03:52] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: i do not know for sure but i do not think it will
[03:52] <paradox34690> anything special I should know about installing it?
[03:52] <Who_> paradox36490: But I find gstreamer with all the plugins (add multiverse as a repository and then use synaptic to  add anything with gstreamer in the name - ugly, bad, etc)
[03:52] <malt> is there anyway to encrypt this?
[03:53] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: if you are going to try it make sure you install 64bit and then reboot into it
[03:53] <bimberi> fourat: sudo cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc blank=fast (blank=all will do a complete erase) - hdc is a guess, your CD writer may be a different device
[03:53] <projkt4> is there a different room i should be asking these questions?
[03:53] <Who_> paradox34690: didn't finish my sentence - gstreamer with all plugins works nicely
[03:53] <red|rain> hey everyone ^_^ i'm updating my machine, but i'm getting very slow download speeds. Right now i'm downloading at 16kb/s when my max at 40k if i'm lucky. I used to be able to download at my full speed of 270k.
[03:53] <flavioribeiro> i have a 'rar' file that constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive, how can i unzip?!
[03:53] <tanubis_> I'm trying to get cedega to play starcraft on my averatec laptop...  Cedega has default settings with starcraft that work for most people, but for me when I try to use it I get the game in a small section of my screen at the top left, and the rest of the screen is black.  Anyone know of anything that would cause video errors like this?
[03:53] <flavioribeiro> actually i have 2 files that one needs the other one to unzip
[03:53] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: then after a couple of days (or hours or minutes depending on how your system feels ) if everything is stable then remove the 386
[03:54] <Pelo> RedKrieg,  if you are talknign about the  dapper to edgy update ,it is terriblty slow
[03:54] <Novagenesis> lol...interesting... Synaptic only sees x86 stuff...how do I add 64-bit capability to my apt?
[03:54] <Who_> tanubis: are you sing anything like XGL, compiz, beryl?
[03:54] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: did you install the 64bit version of ubuntu?
[03:54] <GionnyBoss> hey guys... I can't understand nothing here... I have just installed Ubuntu... I guess I should add a repo and then install all the codecs / plugins... what should I do? I'm new to Ubuntu
[03:54] <fryfrog> when i setup ubuntu, it asked me which nic i wanted to use as primary eth0 or eth1.  I picked eth0 and would like to change to eth1, but am not sure where this setting is.  anyone know?
[03:54] <Novagenesis> no, joejaxx, I installed the 32-bit...i was thinking of trying to update on the fly ;)
[03:54] <red|rain> Pelo, actually it's any sort of update or download on both Dapper/Edgy and my edgy to Feisty upgrade.
[03:54] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: haha :)
[03:55] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: you want to look at the restricted formats page
[03:55] <Novagenesis> hey,. it's not the gutsiest (dumbest) move I've ever made
[03:55] <tanubis_> Who_ to be honest, not entirely sure.  I've never tried gaming on a laptop, my knowledge of video-based things in general is pretty sketchy as I've always just used it for coding.
[03:55] <Novagenesis> and I'm more than willing to stick with ext3 :-D
[03:55] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: it will tell you how to enable certain stuff
[03:55] <Who_> paradox34690: doing it the gstreamer way means lots of apps will work
[03:55] <Pelo> red|rain,  I understand but I can'T help
[03:55] <GionnyBoss> joejaxx: what are the restricted format page?
[03:55] <tanubis_> Who_ how would I check that?
[03:55] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: haha that was not dumb :P i actually use reiserfs
[03:55] <Novagenesis> upgrading a partially installed hoary into dapper is the dumbest thing I've tried...and that blew up at me

[03:56] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: the first link in that post
[03:56] <Novagenesis> joejaxx: yeah, but reiser's a killer now ;P
[03:56] <Who_> tanubis: have you got wobbly windows or have you done anything special to enable special visual effects (given that you don't know - you almost certainly haven't :))
[03:56] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: :D
[03:56] <red|rain> Pelo, what ubuntu server are you downloading from, I have tried Canada (Ca), USA (US) and (UK)
[03:56] <paradox34690> Who: Yeah, already downloading VLC... Not really looking for much work just yet. Like I said, I'm new to this..
[03:56] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: lool  :P
[03:56] <tanubis_> Who_ nope, definatley not.
[03:56] <Fracture> I have an edgy installation using evolution 2.8.1  I am unable to get junk filtering working.  I have installed the packages for both spamassian and bogofilter, the plugins are enabled and I have even trained 2000 junk messages.
[03:56] <GionnyBoss> joejaxx, thanks... I'm going to have a look at that
[03:56] <Who_> tanubis: what kind of graphics chipset are you using?
[03:56] <Novagenesis> joejaxx: but yeah...erm...so I take it doing an on-the-fly upgrade is totally impossible?
[03:56] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: you are most welcome
[03:56] <Who_> tanubis: and do you have the default or the propriety drivers?
[03:56] <euquita> testing
[03:56] <dope> so when i click on places and then select an ftp resources it opens it in firefox.  how do i just get it to open it in nautilus?
[03:57] <Pelo> red|rain,  I honestly donT' know where I got if from originaly,  finaly I just got the dvd from torrents and installed from there
[03:57] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: i do not know if trying to upgrade from a 32bit version of ubuntu to a 64bit version is going to work at all
[03:57] <Who_> !tell Who_ about gstreamer
[03:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gstreamer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:57] <Novagenesis> eh, figured as much ;) i take it i can't even have them both in the same directory
[03:57] <red|rain> Pelo, ahh ok
[03:57] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: :)
[03:57] <dope> so when i click on places and then select an ftp resources it opens it in firefox.  how do i just get it to open it in nautilus?
[03:57] <Novagenesis> i'll stick to 32 bit until i'm more comfortable with 64 bit being sane :)
[03:58] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: :)

[04:00] <GionnyBoss> I found the help about gstreamer stuff... but... should I add a new repo for codecs and other non-free software? on Fedora Core there was a Livna repo with all this stuff
[04:00] <iter> mcrandello: ask your question
[04:00] <mcrandello> iter: I did but it slid by a while ago... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1782430
[04:01] <mcrandello> iter his bug is my bug too
[04:01] <tanubis_> Who_ it's an nvidia I believe, but I can't find the model number anywhere on the thing anymore... it's about a year old, and worn off
[04:01] <Who_> tanubis: no probs - have you installed the nvida binary driver?
[04:01] <iter> tanubis_: I suggest you not rub your video card so much
[04:01] <mcrandello> iter it looks like the packagers on k3d forgot to put in a Python-version field somewhere and apt totally freaks out about it
[04:01] <flavioribeiro> i have a 'rar' file that constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive, how can i unzip?!
[04:01] <flavioribeiro> actually i have 2 files that one needs the other one to unzip
[04:01] <Who_> !tell tanubis about nvidia
[04:01] <crimsun> mcrandello: no, that's not it.
[04:02] <crimsun> mcrandello: it's the fact that the check in python-central is incorrect
[04:02] <anonie>  
[04:02] <Novagenesis> weird...linux-restricted-modules was installed by default according to synaptic.....
[04:02] <luca> flavioribeiro: sudo apt-get install unrar
[04:02] <anonie>  
[04:02] <Novagenesis> but glx-config gave me: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver!
[04:02] <LjL> anonie: this channel is english-speaking
[04:02] <luca> or check for unrar in synaptic
[04:02] <LjL> !il | anonie
[04:02] <ubotu> anonie:          
[04:02] <ubotu> anonie: /join #ubuntu-il
[04:02] <tanubis_> iter: everything is internalized on the laptop, I never do anything with video and don't know how to otherwise check what card is on there except to see system specs for this laptop on the website...  looking for information through software now
[04:02] <flavioribeiro> luca, ive already have the unrar
[04:02] <Who_> !tell tanubis_about nvidia
[04:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about  tell tanubis_about nvidia - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:02] <mcrandello> crimsun: I saw something similar listed as a python-central bug and they weren't going to do anything about it till feisty
[04:02] <VigoFusion> tanubis_: Which version Ubuntu?
[04:03] <Who_> !tell tanubis_ about nvidia
[04:03] <tanubis_> breezy
[04:03] <mcrandello> crimsun: so I suppose getting k3d either on or off the system is right out then
[04:03] <crimsun> mcrandello: it's already fixed in feisty
[04:03] <luca> flavioribeiro: it should function with ark or the gnome extractor, I do not know what else to say
[04:03] <iter> tanubis_: you get anything from lspci ?
[04:03] <crimsun> mcrandello: and it's fixable by modifying /var/lib/dpkg/status directly
[04:03] <Who_> tanubis_: good luck, looks like you're in good hands
[04:04] <VigoFusion> tanubis: Your card and its particuliars #s and such should be listed in the Device Manager, I just found mine there.
[04:04] <Novagenesis> can anyone help me resolve this error: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[04:04] <Novagenesis> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[04:04] <GionnyBoss> ok I resolved my problem about mp3, divx... thanks
[04:04] <Novagenesis> I"m following the instructions the bot pointed me to
[04:05] <Phuzion> is there a way to disable the print screen button on my computer so that it doesn't make the save screenshot box pop up every time my finger comes within 9 feet of the button?
[04:05] <GionnyBoss> now another question... my screen resolution is only 1024x768... I used to have 1600x1200 ... how can I resolve this problem? maybe with nvidia drivers? (I have an nvidia graphic card)
[04:05] <malt> anyone here use ddclient with ubuntu>
[04:05] <Phuzion> btw, I'm using Gnome
[04:05] <malt> ?
[04:05] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,  congrats,  now stick around and then next person with a codecs problem is for you to help
[04:05] <tanubis_> iter : nothing useful, just 0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
[04:05] <mcrandello> crimsun: do you know of detailed instructions? I found where it says deinstall ok half-configured
[04:05] <bimberi> ubotu: tell GionnyBoss about fixres | via /msg
[04:05] <crimsun> mcrandello: pastebin just the block for k3d
[04:05] <RadiantFire> GionnyBoss: er, change it via sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:06] <GionnyBoss> Pelo: ok, no problem! I have experience with Fedora Core 5... so now give me some time with Ubuntu and I think that I can manage it good... and I will be glad to help other people
[04:06] <Pelo> :-)
[04:06] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: anytime :)
[04:06] <GionnyBoss> but... if I remember well... there is only an open source of nvidia driver
[04:06] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,   your problem with resolution might be solved my editing the xorg.conf file to add the 1600 x1200 resolution in the list
[04:06] <mcrandello> crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/255565
[04:07] <GionnyBoss> I'd like to install the full nvidia driver with 3d support
[04:07] <joejaxx> mcrandello: are you getting that python error?
[04:07] <mcrandello> joejaxx: package has no field Python-Version
[04:07] <mcrandello> whenever I apt-get anything
[04:07] <joejaxx> mcrandello: yeah that needs to be fixed
[04:07] <hansin321> GionnyBoss: I just got on, what is your question about the nVidia drivers?  I have been fooling wiht them just now (but am no expert).
[04:07] <joejaxx> mcrandello: k3d was broken in edgy also
[04:07] <hansin321> Does anyone know how to chnage the Window Manager in XFCE to the Beryl Manager? Thanks...
[04:08] <joejaxx> mcrandello: i mean dapper
[04:08] <VigoFusion> GionyBoss: I have yet to figure that one out myself, but it is being worked on, 3 crashes later, expected and prepared for, it may be solved, that is how people helping people get stuff to work.
[04:08] <crimsun> mcrandello: change line 20 to read: Python-Version: current
[04:08] <hansin321> Or just change the manager, I can figure the rest...
[04:08] <Novagenesis> ok, just reinstalled restricted modules for my kernel image (2.6.17.10) and then reinstalled nvidia-glx and tried to run nvidia-glx-config only to get a "make sure your driver is installed"
[04:08] <mcrandello> crimsun: drop the s at the end of Versions, right?
[04:08] <crimsun> mcrandello: yes
[04:08] <hansin321> ARe you guys trying to get Beryl/AIGLX isntaller.  I know of a really straight forward link for doing it.
[04:08] <Phuzion> is there a way to disable the print screen button on my computer so that it doesn't make the save screenshot box pop up every time my finger comes within 9 feet of the button, I'm using Gnome
[04:08] <GionnyBoss> ubuntu is debian based, right?
[04:08] <Phuzion> Yes
[04:09] <Phuzion> Debian based
[04:09] <GionnyBoss> I remember that a year ago I let nvidia 3d drivers work for Debian... I guess it should be the same thing
[04:09] <Novagenesis> a year ago they worked for ubuntu too, lol
[04:09] <GionnyBoss> but I don't remember exactly how I did it :P lol! my memory
[04:09] <Phuzion> lol
[04:09] <Pelo> hansin321,  just give the link
[04:09] <og_> server irc.milw0rm.com
[04:09] <Novagenesis> I just followed this channel's link, step by step, perfectly, and got errors
[04:09] <mungallo> GionnyBoss: theres a great tutorial on the ubuntu forums on installing the nvidia drivers
[04:10] <h4lfl1ng> anyone know how to get sshd running?
[04:10] <GionnyBoss> mungallo, thanks a lot... I will have a look at that
[04:10] <h4lfl1ng> i have it installed but its not in /etc/init.d/
[04:10] <mcrandello> crimsun: thank you that did it!
[04:10] <bimberi> Phuzion: System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts, backspace disables a shortcut
[04:10] <Novagenesis> mungallo: show please? maybe it's not the one that's blowing up in my face?
[04:10] <mungallo> sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start
[04:10] <adept> off topic, but what is a good programming language for working with a fairly large database in a small business?
[04:10] <crimsun> mcrandello: yw
[04:10] <Phuzion> bimberi:  thanks a ton
[04:10] <joejaxx> adept: you want to join #ubuntu-offtopic :D
[04:10] <bimberi> Phuzion: np :)
[04:11] <mcrandello> oooh and k3d actually works right!
[04:11] <h4lfl1ng> sshd isnt in init.d
[04:11] <kitche>   Novagenesis why not just do sudo nvidia-xconfig
[04:11] <joejaxx> adept: we actually have a channel for offtopic talk :)
[04:11] <hansin321> http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/nVIDIA
[04:11] <Novagenesis> kitche oh hey...didn't know that could work,
[04:11] <Novagenesis> ....but I still can't modprobe nvidia
[04:11] <Novagenesis> so i think it'll blow up when i Ctrl-alt-backspace
[04:11] <rhiadon> any good place for help with v4l-dvb on ubuntu?
[04:11] <mungallo> Novagenesis: which release are you running?
[04:12] <GionnyBoss> I think that ubuntu will be my favourite distro... I liked debian but it was very hard to have an updated system... and then I switched to Fedora... but now I'm trying Ubuntu and it looks like a Debian with updated packages and simple to use! very good... and you guys here are great! you help people very well :)
[04:12] <Novagenesis> Edgy
[04:12] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: :)
[04:12] <mcrandello> crimsun, joejaxx: I'll go ahead and post the fix to the forums there for the other dude and the googlers
[04:12] <Novagenesis> I loved dapper on my old system....it installed in practically one click and everything worked perfectly
[04:12] <h4lfl1ng> sudo: /etc/init.d/sshd: command not found
[04:12] <mungallo> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=57368
[04:12] <Novagenesis> well, brb, gonna ctrl-alt-esc..hope i don't come back with "this didn't work"
[04:12] <crimsun> mcrandello: it's not a fix, it's a workaround for the python-central issue that's fixed in feisty.
[04:13] <crimsun> mcrandello: please make that explicit.
[04:13] <VigoFusion> GionyBoss: maybe the http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ might help? (it helped me install some widget) but read the stuff becuase some deb .*** do not work in Ubuntu, most do, I guess, but its allways good to check with someone that has used Linux for more than 1 month<me>
[04:13] <joejaxx> crimsun: oh they fixed that? great :)
[04:13] <Fracture> anyone here use evolution ?
[04:13] <crimsun> joejaxx: yes, some time ago, only merged recently
[04:13] <joejaxx> crimsun: ahh no wonder
[04:13] <mungallo> h4
[04:13] <Abraxa1> okok..it's all good...
[04:13] <mcrandello> crimsun: the issue is that it chokes when it sees a plural "versions"?
[04:13] <mungallo> dpkg -i | grep openssh-server
[04:13] <joejaxx> Fracture: no :( i use thunderbird and sylpheed-claws
[04:13] <tanubis_> !xserver
[04:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xserver - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:14] <crimsun> mcrandello: that's the symptom but not the real bug
[04:14] <mungallo> whats the output of that?
[04:14] <rhiadon> more specifically help with the Kworld ATSC-110 video capture card
[04:14] <tanubis_> anyone know how to reconfigure what resolutions are supported by xserver?
[04:14] <joejaxx> tanubis_: sudo pkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:14] <mungallo> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:14] <joejaxx> tanubis_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:14] <crimsun> mcrandello: the real bug was the runtime/(de)install mismatch
[04:15] <Abraxa1> woohoo! accel working and partly tested...glxgears didn't seem as fast as i liked but they may've put a speedlimit up
[04:15] <joejaxx> adept: nice
[04:15] <joejaxx> Abraxa1: nice
[04:16] <Abraxa1> hmm
[04:16] <Pelo> tanubis_,   edit the xorg.conf file and add the resolutions you need manualy,  you might have to edit the refresh rate to
[04:16] <Abraxa1> ok phew..thought it nickswapped me
[04:16] <joejaxx> Abraxa1: atleast the gears are turning :)
[04:16] <Jupiter> how can i access snort? i have it installed. is it a gui app or do i have to run it in terminal
[04:16] <Abraxa1> maybe it did
[04:16] <h4lfl1ng> mungallo: gives the documentation for dpkg
[04:16] <projkt4> i think i figgured it out
[04:16] <rhiadon> anybody with good amounts of mythtv experience using ubuntu?
[04:16] <projkt4> now i'm having problems mounting the windows share
[04:16] <Kingsqueak> Jupiter: it runs in the background and logs to a file
[04:16] <Abraxa1> no, but I'm actually trying to price a mythbox for the near future in my life
[04:17] <Abraxa1> ok, my next apt-get is xchat... gaim is not meant for irc
[04:17] <projkt4> smbfs: mount_data version 1919251317 is not supported
[04:17] <Pelo> projkt4,  ntfs ??   check synaptic for nfts-3g
[04:17] <VigoFusion> The Future is Now
[04:17] <boardom> any idea what would cause a system to drift 20 minutes over the course of a day?
[04:17] <mcrandello> crimsun: I'm not sure I completely understand but I'll make sure that it gets listed as something that will be fixed in Feisty's python-central
[04:17] <Jupiter> kingsqueak a default file?
[04:17] <mungallo> sorry, the arg is -l     dpkg -l | grep ssh
[04:17] <boardom> Abraxa1: screen + irssi is meant for irc
[04:17] <Kingsqueak> Jupiter: you configure it
[04:17] <rhiadon> I've got all the parts I need. I'm just apparently not smart enough to get them working together
[04:17] <Abraxa1> brb, xchat
[04:17] <dope> when i click "Places" in the top bar and select a FTP resource it opens it in firefox instead f nautilus.  how do i fix that?
[04:17] <projkt4> mount -t smbfs -o username=sanitized,password=sanitized //192.168.1.35/downloads /windows-share/i
[04:17] <Abraxas_> u
[04:17] <joejaxx> boardom: yeah ssh + screen + irssi is great especiall being in ubuntu channels
[04:17] <crimsun> mcrandello: not "will be fixed". "is fixed".
[04:18] <projkt4> gets me this in dmesg
[04:18] <Abraxas_> there
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> Jupiter: for reporting/searching on the data, take a look at 'acid'
[04:18] <Abraxas_> finally off that stupid Gaim for chatting
[04:18] <Pelo> dope,  look it up in the forum
[04:18] <Jupiter> from the terminal? or do i access it from the browser, mysql or?
[04:18] <boardom> joejaxx: i'd die without it
[04:18] <projkt4> smbfs: mount_data version 1919251317 is not supported
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> Jupiter: to configure it, you edit a file and restart it
[04:18] <boardom> Seriously though... any idea what would cause system time to slide 20 minutes over a day
[04:18] <boardom> ntpd doesn't seem to handle it
[04:18] <mcrandello> crimsun: got it.
[04:18] <h4lfl1ng> mungallo: dpkg -l | grep ssh
[04:18] <h4lfl1ng> ops

The little icon in the top right indicates that I appear to be UDP and TCP firewalled. I can not get connected to ultrapeers, and can not get downloads. Any ideas what could cause the firewall change or the gtk-gnutella change?
[04:18] <mungallo> yep
[04:18] <projkt4> anybody mount windows shares in edgy?
[04:19] <Jupiter> ok thanks, thats my answer, much obliged kingsqueak

[04:20] <mungallo> my inits are under /etc/init.d/ssh
[04:20] <GionnyBoss> ok I followed the guide to install nvidia drivers... now I will reboot... see you later :) I hope it will work :)
[04:20] <GionnyBoss> bye
[04:21] <wolfie> hello
[04:21] <joejaxx> Abraxas_: lol compile it :)
[04:21] <joejaxx> wolfie: hello
[04:21] <h4lfl1ng> mungallo: so would i do 'sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start' ?
[04:21] <Pelo> Abraxas_,  wine not good enough for you ?
[04:21] <mungallo> yes
[04:21] <wolfie> can anyone help with ubuntu on a AMD64?
[04:21] <h4lfl1ng> okay it worked
[04:21] <Abraxas_> Eh...I have had issues running some of my games in wine in the past...i already purchased a license for cedega for at least 3 months hence
[04:21] <mungallo> probably wolfie
[04:21] <joejaxx> wolfie: what do you need help with
[04:21] <wolfie> cool
[04:21] <Abraxas_> and cracking my legit games is just annoying
[04:22] <wolfie> here is the thing
[04:22] <wolfie> ubuntu out of the box gives a generic kernel
[04:22] <h4lfl1ng> mungallo: do you know how to change default pass/username and get the ip its accessable through
[04:22] <wolfie> which was freezing at time
[04:22] <Pelo> wolfie,  that is normal,  that is how it works now
[04:22] <mungallo> Abraxas, you know theres a deb for it right?
[04:22] <wolfie> ah!
[04:22] <britt> if im using a ati video card and xfce, how can i get xgl to work?
[04:23] <britt> and will xgl work with mythtv?
[04:23] <Abraxas_> mungallo: yeah....it also freezes whenever i try to update remotely, so i'm downloading the parts
[04:23] <mungallo> yes, you change whatever the username and password you're logging in to.
[04:23] <Pelo> wolfie,  there is an explanation somewhere about the generic kernel vs other type,  you can probably look it up in the forum
[04:23] <wolfie> it does not provide support for my ATI Mobility Radeon X600 video card
[04:23] <joejaxx> Phuzion: he is talking about the freezing
[04:23] <Pelo> wolfie,  I suggest you also look that up in the forum
[04:23] <dabaR> Hi. I am having trouble with gtk-gnutella since that. The little icon in the top right says I am UDP and TCP firewalled. (It did not use to say that, and I have not changed firewall settings afaik) I can not get downloads. I tried removing ~/.gtk-gnutella, purging and reinstalling the package. Any other ideas?
[04:23] <wolfie> and the broadcom wireles stuff is a nighmare to try to make it work
[04:23] <Pelo> dabaR,  try doing a reinstall from syanptic
[04:24] <dabaR> Pelo: I did apt-get remove --purge, and install, do you think it could make a difference?
[04:24] <Abraxas_> actually..seems anything that has any remote contact with transgaming freezes my cedega up :-\
[04:24] <VigoFusion> britt: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273934 look around that area, the Forums are great.
[04:24] <wolfie> I did looked it up...
[04:24] <mungallo> Unix(linux, bsd, etc) is a multiuser OS. Anything you want to do remotely(through SSH) is the same as doing it while youre sitting at your terminal.
[04:24] <mungallo> login will be your username
[04:24] <wolfie> not much help for 64-bit stuff, thougfh
[04:24] <Abraxas_> course, that's not this channel's problem
[04:24] <mungallo> password will be your password
[04:25] <wolfie> also, the sound works randomly on reboot
[04:25] <Pelo> dabaR,  probably not,  you could try deleting /home/user/.gtk-gnutella  , should reset to default
[04:25] <wolfie> I even try re-compiling the kernel, same problems
[04:25] <GionnyBoss> wow! nvidia driver seems to work :) it was very quick to set it up with ubuntu :)
[04:25] <gunfus> can someone help demistify  the differences between crontab and the /etc/cron.daily directory?
[04:25] <mungallo> IP will be resolved by dns or if you're on a lan, ifconfig -a
[04:25] <dabaR> Pelo: tried that as well.
[04:25] <Pelo> dabaR,  I am out of idea
[04:25] <dabaR> Pelo: thank you.
[04:26] <GionnyBoss> how can I change my screen resolution to 1600x1200? someone told me before, but I don't remember exactly... can you repeat it please? dpkg-reconfigure .... ?
[04:26] <VigoFusion> Login Name is MyName, Password is God. I thought everyone did it that way. :)
[04:26] <mungallo> HAHAHAHA
[04:26] <mcrandello> crimsun, joejaxx: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=303289&page=2
[04:26] <snype> change it in ur /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[04:26] <wolfie> hello
[04:26] <gunfus> can someone help demistify  the differences between crontab and the /etc/cron.daily directory?
[04:27] <GionnyBoss> Pelo, ok thanks
[04:27] <gunfus> sorry for repeting
[04:27] <gunfus> but noone is replying
[04:27] <dabaR> GionnyBoss: well, there is snype's way^, or sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:27] <euquita> does anybody here know how to remove the voice audio from a karaoke vcd?
[04:27] <GionnyBoss> what's snype's was?
[04:27] <mungallo> crontab updates cron
[04:27] <GionnyBoss> way
[04:27] <snype> look up
[04:27] <GionnyBoss> I'm italian.. I don't know what snype mean :P
[04:27] <Abraxas_> alright..guess now's a good time to populate with linux games...any key suggestions?
[04:27] <snype> GionnyBoss type "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[04:28] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,  snype is a user
[04:28] <mungallo> cron.daily is where you locate scripts that you want to run once a day.
[04:28] <GionnyBoss> ahahah sorry snype :P
[04:28] <dabaR> GionnyBoss: :)
[04:28] <snype> no prob home dawg
[04:28] <gunfus> mungallo: and cronttab?
=== Abraxas_ is now known as Novagenesis
[04:28] <Novagenesis> bleh..sorry the name keeps hopping...i'm having minor issues tryna figure out what was what from gaim
[04:28] <GionnyBoss> you know... I went out tonight and I'm a bit drunk... so... sorry if I look stupid :P lol
[04:28] <mungallo> gunfus: I answered that earlier, it updates cron so you don't need to restart the service.
[04:29] <snype> drunk + linux = no good
[04:29] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,  that's ok the rest of that channel is stonned
[04:29] <GionnyBoss> haahah
[04:29] <Novagenesis> pelo: really? nobody offered me any
[04:29] <snype> ubuntu is my anti-drug
[04:29] <GionnyBoss> ok I'm in the xorg.conf file
[04:29] <GionnyBoss> now what should I do?
[04:29] <gunfus> mungallo: okay.. so if I want to create a hourly job
[04:29] <VigoFusion> drunk+UNIX=Good Memories of youth well spent.
[04:29] <snype> ok look for a bunch of resolutions
[04:29] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[04:29] <Novagenesis> sex and drugs are my anti-drug
[04:30] <gunfus> mungallo: I just create an executable at the cron.hourly?
[04:30] <Pahalial> I'm intrigued. Why do the ubuntu docs require SSL?
[04:30] <Pelo> GionnyBoss, read down a bit you'll see a bunch of screen rez,  jsut add your own
[04:30] <snype> look for the modlines and add 1600x1200
[04:30] <GionnyBoss> Pelo, ok thanks
[04:30] <mungallo> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron
[04:30] <gunfus> mungallo: I tired that
[04:30] <dabaR> Pahalial: well, a possible reason would be to have confidence it is really the official docs.
[04:30] <Pahalial> I... see..
[04:30] <gunfus> mungallo: but it doesn't talk about cron.hourly
[04:31] <mungallo> its all set up the same way.
[04:31] <VigoFusion> snype: I can just alter those in the Dev Manager? or I need to do in Terminal?
[04:31] <dabaR> Pahalial: most of us here are not official with ubuntu, so that is not an official reason, but it sounds like a possible answer.
[04:31] <snype> the modlines?
[04:31] <VigoFusion> Yes
[04:31] <snype> terminal
[04:31] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[04:31] <snype> type: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:31] <Pahalial> fair enough
[04:32] <snype> and it;ll bring up the text editor and allow you to change the modlines
[04:32] <mungallo> gunfus are you trying to run a job once an hour? or once a day?
[04:32] <GionnyBoss> Pelo, I did it but it doesn't work... should I restart my computer?
[04:32] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,  you also might have to adjust your horiz sync and vertrez  settings
[04:32] <gunfus> I am trying to run a job every 10 minutes
[04:32] <gunfus> mungalo: I am trying to run a job every 10 minutes
[04:32] <Pelo> GionnyBoss,  yes you'll need to restart the comp
[04:32] <dabaR> GionnyBoss: just restart the x server, run sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart in a terminal
[04:32] <malt> anyone here use dynamic dns client ddclient?
[04:32] <dabaR> Pelo: just the X server.
[04:33] <dabaR> malt: I use ez-ipupdate it works for dyndns if noone can answer your question
[04:33] <snype> or you could just type ctrl+alt+backspace afterwards
[04:33] <malt> I need a dns client that updates by link
[04:33] <GionnyBoss> but how can I change my horiz sync and vert synk? I just know that I used to use 85Hz
[04:33] <mcrandello> the old 3 finger salute got ported to the linux desktop :p
[04:33] <mungallo> never tried that, but 10,20,30,40,50 jobname might work
[04:33] <snype> same config file
[04:33] <Andaluz_LNX> hi all
[04:33] <GionnyBoss> I think that it was more simple to use the dpkg-reconfigure thing :P
[04:34] <gunfus> mungallo: but where do I put that man?
[04:34] <euquita> does anybody here know of an app on how to remove the voice audio from a karaoke vcd?
[04:34] <dabaR> GionnyBoss: may be
[04:34] <gunfus> mungallo: I have the line that I want but I am not sure where to put it
[04:34] <dabaR> malt: I don't know what update by link means
[04:34] <gunfus> mungallo: I tried sudo crontab -e but that create a temp file
[04:34] <Kingsqueak> cron every ten minutes is   0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *    /path/to/script
[04:34] <GionnyBoss> I remeber I did the dpkg-reconfigure on Debian a year ago, now I try :)
[04:34] <Andaluz_LNX> anyone know how to reinstall grub without having to download the alternate cd?
[04:34] <malt> dabaR by url link
[04:34] <GionnyBoss> hey really guys... sorry if I say this again... but you are great
[04:34] <GionnyBoss> thanks for all your help
[04:35] <joejaxx> Andaluz_LNX: yeah use grub-install
[04:35] <snype> Andaluz_LNX you can do it just using grub install
[04:35] <snype> then restarting
[04:35] <Novagenesis> wee, tremulous just blew up
[04:35] <snype> grub is essentially a program
[04:35] <joejaxx> Novagenesis: haha
[04:35] <gunfus> mungallo: so i am lost in that sence.. i have craeted jobs in cron.daily by just creating a file with the name with the script to execute
[04:35] <dabaR> malt: so you do not want to update your dyndns.org account in other words?
[04:35] <Novagenesis> it lost its cursor when it errored on a file
[04:35] <paradox34690> hey, didn't catch if anyone had a reply for me about my question, I had to restart my gaim... if you had an answer would you mind reposting?
[04:35] <snype> so i gave up on xubuntu after like 30 minutes :-/
[04:35] <bruenig> xubuntu is great
[04:35] <snype> paradox
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: as the user that needs to run the cron, run 'crontab -e' that will edit the crontab for that user, then paste the line as I showed it with your path/to/script
[04:35] <VigoFusion> grup can be downloaded at many places, Debian has a good one.
[04:35] <snype> what's ur question
[04:35] <joejaxx> snype: why?
[04:35] <mcrandello> one last stupid q, are there any good 2d "versus fighter" games packaged for ubuntu?
[04:36] <VigoFusion> *grub
[04:36] <snype> i actually ditched it because i hated not having a wifi monitor haha
[04:36] <bruenig> all the functionality of gnome without the resource hog
[04:36] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: as soon as you close that edit session , it is active
[04:36] <bimberi> Andaluz_LNX: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows includes a method using Desktop/Live CD
[04:36] <joejaxx> snype: :(
[04:36] <snype> such a newb reason- but it was serious enough
[04:36] <mungallo> put a script in cron.hourly and run crontab
[04:36] <joejaxx> snype: yeah
[04:36] <paradox34690> oh, well, mind if I pm you? it's rather long snype...
[04:36] <snype> yeha
[04:36] <snype> thats cool
[04:36] <malt> dabaR: i don't use a free domain, i use boxz.us and dyndns charges a year for custom domains
[04:36] <paradox34690> okay
[04:37] <snype> my comp's fast enough to run gnome so it was no big deal
[04:37] <dabaR> malt: OK, thank you for the explanation.
[04:37] <joejaxx> snype: ah ok :)
[04:37] <felixjet> when i restart pc, gnome dont restore my session and i need to open again all programs manually. how can i fix it?
[04:37] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: let me try that
[04:37] <Skwid_> is there a linux equivalent to http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom ???? (no emacs or vim tweaking please)
[04:38] <joejaxx> Skwid_: not that i know of
[04:38] <snype> joejaxx u on xubuntu?
[04:38] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: when i am saving the file it asks me for a filename to write and it shows /tmp/crontab.ax84314/cronttab
[04:38] <Skwid_> :(
[04:38] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: is that correct
[04:38] <mungallo> gedit
[04:38] <joejaxx> Skwid_: no i am on  fluxbuntu
[04:38] <mungallo> or kate
[04:38] <Novagenesis> Skwid_:  looks to me like nano in a fulllscreen
[04:38] <mcrandello> Skwid_: I assume ed tweaking is right out then :)
[04:38] <jariep1__> hi all
[04:39] <joejaxx> Skwid_: you could go to Console #2 and open nano :D
[04:39] <snype> Skwid_ what about just using nano?
[04:39] <snype> exactly what i was thinking!
[04:39] <Skwid_> hum ... ok
[04:39] <snype> joejaxx u beat me
[04:39] <joejaxx> snype: haha :D
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: yup, just save it as is
[04:39] <Novagenesis> and i beatcha both :)
[04:39] <bruenig> felixjet, gnome doesn't save sessions. You ought to put the programs you want to start at start up in system>preferences>sessions>startup commands
[04:39] <snype> great minds think a like
[04:39] <gunfus> done
[04:39] <snype> haha its cool
[04:39] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: done..
[04:39] <joejaxx> Skwid_: it might sound weird but it works
[04:39] <kalila> so I installed mysql-server
[04:39] <kalila> how to run the thing
[04:39] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: anyway to confirm that is actually occuring?
[04:39] <dabaR> felixjet: http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man1/gnome-session-save.1.html may help
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: as that user type 'crontab -l'  that will show you that the file is there as written
[04:39] <kalila> is there no "services" interface for linux?
[04:39] <kalila> ubuntu
[04:39] <felixjet> ty bruenig, i didnt know :p
[04:40] <joejaxx> kalila: yes ther eis
[04:40] <snype> kalila bootup manager
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: also if your script has output, cront will mail that to you
[04:40] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: I see that.. now
[04:40] <joejaxx> kalila: System >> Admin >> Services
[04:40] <snype> i forget what its called but its in the automatix2 setup
[04:40] <snype> or that--
[04:40] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: I am sending the output to ./dev/null
[04:40] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: I guess I could remove that and see if ti works
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: ah o.k. so you did   > /dev/null 2>&1
[04:40] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: right
[04:40] <paradox34690> okay, I'm new to linux, I'm trying to find a good universal player for Linux, I was recommended VLC. I just installed it, and I'm having an error message while trying to open a web link..
[04:40] <snype> im so happy! i got a free IBM thinkpad t42 a few days ago
[04:40] <felixjet> dabaR:  :))))
[04:40] <Skwid_> joejaxx: not quite what i'd like .. but sure it works
[04:40] <paradox34690> the message is saying something about Totem having an issue of opening the .ASF file.... is there a way to set file associations like in windows?
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: basically if you run the script as that user manually and it works, it will work via cron
[04:41] <tonyyarusso> snype: How?
[04:41] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Well iu really didn't want to leave teh job running all night and recive TONS of email tomorrow
[04:41] <sky123> kalila: there is.. but the easiest way is to sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: heheh
[04:41] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: heheh
[04:41] <joejaxx> snype: that is what i am on now
[04:41] <kalila> sky123: that assumes that I'm gonna do that on every start
[04:41] <snype> nice me too
[04:41] <snype> i actually have two t42's now
[04:41] <joejaxx> snype: i whould recommend a thinkpad to anyone wanting a laptop that just works out the box
[04:41] <snype> the best machine
[04:41] <joejaxx> snype: with Ubuntu that is
[04:41] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: ohh by the way.. I hjust did a >/dev/null
[04:41] <bruenig> paradox34690, the common *nix philosophy is that each piece of software ought to do one thing good. So generally you can get a good music player or a good video player but not both. The video players will play music but that is not there may purpose.
[04:41] <mungallo> paradox that sounds like a codec issue
[04:41] <sky123> kalila: well you wont have to....I believe it starts once you install it because it is in rc.d
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: another utility that a lot of people don't know about is 'at' , it's like cron, scheduled run but only for running something once at a scheduled time
[04:42] <dabaR> felixjet: or even... gconf-editor>apps>gnome-session>options>auto-save-session
[04:42] <snype> thinkpads are hands down the best laptops
[04:42] <bruenig> main purpose*
[04:42] <britt> can anybody recommend a nice wireless keybd/mouse
[04:42] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: hmm
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: proper way is   /path/to/script > /dev/null 2>&1    that captures both stdout and stderr
[04:42] <snype> well through  a long list of events someone gave me an hp laptop-- piece of junk and then someone i know had a t42 and wanted a bigger screen so they just traded me
[04:42] <sky123> kalila: Id highly suggest you change the default mysql password as well as it is NOT set
[04:42] <mad> hey everybody
[04:42] <gunfus> okay
[04:42] <snype> and since i already had a t42, now i have twins
[04:42] <kalila> sky123: was just about to ask about default pw..
[04:42] <dabaR> felixjet: I read that gnome does not save sessions by default on planet.gnome.org on someone's blog, so I figured there has to be an option.
[04:43] <bruenig> paradox34690, to set file defaults, right click on the file>properties>open with, that will change the default open with application for all files with that filetype
[04:43] <sky123> kalila: http://www.netadmintools.com/art90.html
[04:43] <mad> can anybody tell me what is the best session for the beryl!??
[04:43] <Novagenesis> !codecs

[04:43] <joejaxx> britt: mad best session?
[04:43] <snype> britt- logitech keyvboard M$ mouse
[04:43] <Novagenesis> well that was a painlses question
[04:43] <britt> cool
[04:43] <bruenig> mad, #ubuntu-xgl
[04:43] <Skwid_> do you guys have any tips to make the web fonts better on ubuntu ?
[04:43] <britt> i have a labtec i got for free
[04:43] <Skwid_> some sites look horrible :(
[04:43] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: fwiw '2' is stderr the '>' can be read as send into and '1' is stdout so stderr is sort of folded into stdout and both then wind up in /dev/null
[04:43] <britt> it sucks
[04:44] <bruenig> Skwid_, sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[04:44] <gunfus> right
[04:44] <joejaxx> Skwid_: yeah the fonts look all scraggly?
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> k
[04:44] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Coolio
[04:44] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: thanks for that
[04:44] <Kingsqueak> no problem
[04:44] <bruenig> Skwid_, it is in multiverse so make sure you have that enabled
[04:44] <yokobr> pleasee
[04:44] <dabaR> Hi. I am having trouble with gtk-gnutella. The little icon in the top right says I am UDP and TCP firewalled. (It did not use to say that, and I have not changed firewall settings afaik) I can not get downloads. I tried removing ~/.gtk-gnutella, purging and reinstalling the package. Any other ideas?
[04:44] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: well i figure that I will just wait until 10:50 and see if I get the email
[04:44] <yokobr> i need to unrar something
[04:44] <yokobr> ive installed it but i dont know how to use
[04:45] <yokobr> unrar?
[04:45] <Skwid_> joejaxx: yeah .. the letters are almost on top of one another
[04:45] <joejaxx> Skwid_: yes i know what you mean
[04:45] <snype> joejaxx u use ubuntu or xubuntu?
[04:45] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: So explain me then what is the cron.hourly  for?
[04:45] <dabaR> yokobr: what exact package did you install?
[04:45] <Skwid_> bruenig: msttcorefonts is already the newest version.
[04:45] <bruenig> I believe he said fluxbuntu
[04:45] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: If youd on't mind
[04:45] <GionnyBoss> ok now I have the right screen resolution :) thanks guys
[04:45] <yokobr> unrar non-free
[04:45] <joejaxx> Skwid_: they are quite ugly, that package should fix that
[04:45] <snype> mybad
[04:45] <Skwid_> joejaxx: i already have the package :(
[04:45] <GionnyBoss> sorry if I keep asking... what about flash plugin for firefox?
[04:45] <joejaxx> Skwid_: really?
[04:45] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: flashplugin-nonfree
[04:46] <snype> GionnyBoss just go get automatix2
[04:46] <joejaxx> snype: noo :(
[04:46] <bruenig> !automatix
[04:46] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[04:46] <yokobr> yrap, ive got it installed
[04:46] <snype> joejaxx why not?
[04:46] <kd7swh> metacity isn't starting at login and adding it to start-up list isn't working - any thoughts
[04:46] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: those files are for system based scripts generally that do maintenance, they do what they say basically, that one would run whatever on an hourly basis via the system cron schedule
[04:46] <Skwid_> joejaxx: yah
[04:46] <VigoFusion> Wait, I missed the fix for Setting Screen like it was in winders?
[04:46] <yokobr> but i dunno how to unrar it
[04:46] <GionnyBoss> lol
[04:46] <joejaxx> snype: automatix breaks systems literally
[04:46] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: what you just edited was a per-user cron
[04:46] <bruenig> Skwid_, people have different preferences I guess. Maybe try going into edit>preferences in firefox and messing around with the font settings
[04:46] <yokobr> the file that i need to unrar
[04:46] <snype> hah its fine on mine
[04:46] <snype> lol
[04:46] <VigoFusion> :-/
[04:46] <GionnyBoss> lol snype
[04:46] <joejaxx> snype: yeah it might be presently
[04:47] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: if you do 'apropos cron' you will see all the man pages for the different cron entries
[04:47] <snype> im doing a fresh install on my new one right now and was just about to go get it so thanks for the heads up
[04:47] <dabaR> yokobr: what version of Ubuntu do you use?
[04:47] <joejaxx> snype: but wait until you try to update or upgrade to a new release
[04:47] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Ahhh! okay.. so one is the table for the users specific cron jobs (as long as they are allowed) and the other is system cron jobs
[04:47] <yokobr> 6.06
[04:47] <bruenig> http://getautomatix.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ&Itemid=35#Is_Automatix2_safe_.3F_Folks_in_.23ubuntu_on_IRC_keep_telling_me_it_isn.27t
[04:47] <yokobr> dapper
[04:47] <joejaxx> snype: ah ok :D
[04:47] <gunfus> Kingsqueak:
[04:47] <snype> i will never upgrade
[04:47] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Cool
[04:47] <dabaR> yokobr: are you sure the package name was unrar-nonfree?
[04:47] <snype> always fesh install
[04:47] <joejaxx> bruenig: yeah that is all incorrect
[04:47] <joejaxx> lol
[04:47] <yokobr> yeap
[04:47] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: as in  man 1 crontab ; man 5 crontab ; man 8 cron  etc.
[04:47] <yokobr> absolutely sure
[04:47] <dabaR> yokobr: cause ubotu says there is only:
[04:48] <dabaR> !find unrar dapper
[04:48] <ubotu> Found: unrar-free, unrar
[04:48] <joejaxx> snype: well they also use scripts and do not package things right
[04:48] <kd7swh> metacity isn't starting at login and adding it to start-up list isn't working - any thoughts
[04:48] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: man 5 crontab should explain the files
[04:48] <OMGYAY> !find grandma
[04:48] <yokobr> got it babe!
[04:48] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: COOlio!
[04:48] <bruenig> I know but it is fun. The argument I don't think is incorrect. It seems to say, we have so many people do it, that those who do have problems represent the minority, therefore it doesn't matter.
[04:48] <ubotu> Package/file grandma does not exist in edgy
[04:48] <yokobr> Ive made it
[04:48] <dabaR> yokobr: good work.
[04:48] <yokobr> thanx for the atention =)
[04:48] <OMGYAY> anyone know how to make YTMND pages work in Firefox?
[04:48] <snype> joejaxx-- if u say its bad i trust u, im installing manually------ apt-get isnt really manually tho is it lol
[04:48] <dabaR> yokobr: yup
[04:48] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Thanks for that info.. 2 more minutes 2 go and I will hopefully get an email
[04:49] <joejaxx> snype: lol
[04:49] <GionnyBoss> should I add another repo? looks like I can found everything without adding new repos... this is cool! but in other linux distros you should add repos to do find everything you need
[04:49] <dabaR> GionnyBoss: add repos only when you need something from them
[04:49] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: i whould just stick to the ubuntu repositories :)
[04:49] <Pelo> great my gui is frozen , any ideas ? I can't get to the menues and the taskbars donT' work , the opened apps seems to be doing ok tho
[04:49] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: yes follow what dabaR said :)
[04:50] <GionnyBoss> ok thanks
[04:50] <snype> pelo--- power.cord.
[04:50] <joejaxx> GionnyBoss: you are most welcome
[04:50] <snype> lol
[04:50] <bruenig> GionnyBoss, add the multiverse and universe repos and that tends to be all you need. The few packages that you might want out of it can be found in deb version anyways, so I would generally say to not worry about it
[04:50] <GionnyBoss> it's just weird! I mean... it's too good :) I didn't expect to find everything in default repos
[04:50] <joejaxx> Pelo: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
[04:50] <DarkMageZ> Pelo, do the desktop icons work ok?
[04:50] <dabaR> Pelo: you mean the gnome-panel is not working? run killall gnome-panel in a terminal
[04:50] <joejaxx> Pelo: restart x
[04:50] <Pelo> dark,  yes
[04:50] <GionnyBoss> what a cool distribution is ubuntu ;)
[04:50] <snype> yep
[04:50] <nivekz> hello, i missed the default system font very much, could any one told me what is the name of the default font?
[04:51] <britt> hey is it possible to upgrade from xfce->gnome
[04:51] <Pelo> Joejaxx   how ?
[04:51] <DarkMageZ> Pelo, then follow dabaR's suggestion of opening a terminal and running "killall gnome-panel"
[04:51] <bruenig> !thanks | GionnyBoss
[04:51] <ubotu> GionnyBoss: You're Welcome!
[04:51] <snype> ubuntu is gonna revalutionize linux-- i'm telling u
[04:51] <dabaR> Pelo: do what I said first
[04:51] <Novagenesis> it works..that's all I care... Suse didn't....
[04:51] <joejaxx> Pelo: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
[04:51] <snype> britt--- sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[04:51] <snype> that'll do it for u
[04:51] <joejaxx> Pelo: yeah do that first
[04:51] <britt> easy enough
[04:51] <kd7swh> you can install gnome
[04:51] <snype> then u can select which u wanna log into
[04:51] <joejaxx> Pelo: killall gnome-panel
[04:51] <snype> yessir
[04:51] <Novagenesis> ubuntu will revolutionize linux when it licenses Restricted formats directly, somehow
[04:51] <TETE> hello, how can i install a flyvideo 2000 tv ?
[04:51] <britt> and its true--ubuntu will revolutionize linux
[04:51] <Pelo> that did it , thanks
[04:51] <britt> i'd gladly pay for an OS that I can freely customize if need be
[04:51] <maurox> does someone knows if it exist  some program to startup process like gamehost ????
[04:52] <joejaxx> UbuntuConfused: ?
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: I forgot about this too, there's a shortcut for writing every 10 mins    */10 * * * *  /path/to/script
[04:52] <protolnx> is it possible to play eternal lands as singleplayer?
[04:52] <joejaxx> UbuntuConfused: need help?
[04:52] <UbuntuConfused> Hi all. Not sure this is even possible, but what the heck....
[04:52] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: that is good to know
[04:52] <bruenig> !hi | UbuntuConfused
[04:52] <ubotu> UbuntuConfused: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:52] <GionnyBoss> and what about mplayer? I saw I can install it and I can install mozilla plugin too... but... what about mplayer codecs?
[04:52] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: I defined it every 10 20 30.. etc..
[04:52] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: that is much faster
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: that's the old 'safe' way
[04:52] <pyro> *yawnz*
[04:53] <rad|x> hi, when you enter a password, it says "it's a dictionary word, bad password etc" does anyone know where is the file that it's using for comparison?
[04:53] <UbuntuConfused> I've got a mythbox, sitting in a cupboard, doing front end to tv.  I'm currnetly connecting to it for admin via xdmcp....
[04:53] <pyro> my wmv files dont play sound :(
[04:53] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: other *nix systems don't understand the  */10 * * * *
[04:53] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: I like the oldsafe way because it is easier to understand although the new one is faster
[04:53] <dabaR> pyro: do you have w32codecs installed?
[04:53] <joejaxx> pyro: you probably need w32codecs
[04:54] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: you put commas in right?  10,20,30 * * * *
[04:54] <UbuntuConfused> This is working fine. I can login from my other ubuntu box on my network and admin it etc....BUT...the 'desktop' box has a dual-output nvidia (using binary drivers)....

[04:54] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: cool
[04:54] <rad|x> where's the dictionary file on linux?
[04:54] <snype> can i just install the debian version of swiftfox?
[04:54] <rad|x> or on ubuntu
[04:54] <bruenig> snype, they have a deb on the swiftfox website. you can use that
[04:54] <snype> thanks!
[04:54] <joejaxx> snype: swiftfox? they should have a deb on the site
[04:54] <UbuntuConfused> What I would ideally like [question here::]  - Can I have 2 _separate_ logins : remote xdmcp on display 1,  local ubuntu user on display 2
[04:55] <VigoFusion> Knoppix gave it a good shot, I gotta admit, that one was GUI happy, but this Ubuntu will make any Migration from the most sold and most used OS an experience to be relished. I have shown my desktop to 5 people, they are all on Ubuntu now, and 1/2 have diestroyed the other they were Users of.
[04:55] <bruenig> snype, or you can be really cool and just use the precompiled directory. Extract it put it in /opt and move from there
[04:55] <GionnyBoss> mplayer mozilla plugin seems not to work... maybe should I add mplayer codecs? can anybody help me please?
[04:55] <MrRio> rad|x: /usr/share/dict/american-english
[04:55] <dabaR> rad|x: it looks like /etc/dict<tab><tab>, but aptitude search dict will let you install an actual dictionary, my edgy install does not even have the dict command installed

[04:55] <Drace> Hi. Real quick one I think. I am looking for the correct way to restart a process via the kill command in Ubuntu. Some certain flags, maybe. Tried looking in 'man kill', but it's not all that helpful. Anyone?
[04:55] <rad|x> nod thanks alot
[04:56] <kd7swh> try killall
[04:56] <snype> Drace first do a pidof NAMEOFAPP then kill w/ that id
[04:56] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: so if I want this every hour I can also do the * */1 * * * ?
[04:56] <dabaR> Drace: do you know the pid?
[04:56] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: yup
[04:56] <Drace> dabaR  - yup
[04:56] <hipertracker> I have Ubuntu 6. I cannot find db_load. I need it for vsftpd.
[04:56] <gunfus> Kingsqueak: Great
[04:56] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[04:56] <dabaR> Drace: kill -9 <pid> will most of the time do it
[04:56] <moyote> Do you need to uninstall mozilla-firefox before installing swiftfox??
[04:57] <bruenig> !hi | KnowledgEngi
[04:57] <ubotu> KnowledgEngi: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[04:57] <Drace> Okay. I'll give it a shot.

[04:57] <MrRio> moyote: i don't think you do
[04:57] <bruenig> moyote, no, it is a bad idea in fact to do that
[04:57] <UbuntuConfused> any ideas anyone? :-)
[04:57] <moyote> bruenig, ok, ty
[04:57] <KnowledgEngi> using ubuntu edgy the software rosegarden do not show the note in the score!
[04:57] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: you might find a bunch of these useful btw  http://www.tldp.org/guides.html
[04:57] <hipertracker> I try to find something in google. shit. nothing usefull. without db_load i cannot set database for virtual users of vftpd
[04:58] <bruenig> KnowledgEngi, what?
[04:58] <tritium> hipertracker: please watch the language
[04:58] <Drace> dabaR - That worked. Thanks. :D
[04:58] <dabaR> Drace: welcome
[04:58] <bruenig> software rosegarden?
[04:58] <Kingsqueak> gunfus: you stick your nose in those on and off, you will learn a TON

[04:59] <VigoFusion> Big Thankies for that link
[04:59] <UbuntuConfused> So, succinctly: With dual-output NVidia card, is it possible to have a different login/xsession on Display 1 and Display 2 ?
[05:00] <GionnyBoss> wow, it's all very easy :) everything works and I spend only a little time to do it :)
[05:01] <KnowledgEngi> bruenig, you now what is a score in music??
[05:01] <KnowledgEngi> do you ..
[05:01] <dabaR> I am getting an error in _gtk-gnutella_ about being firewalled. This is the output of iptables -L http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33385/ . I am not sure what to do. help:)
[05:01] <Farm_Fresh> My wireless connection keeps getting dropped.  Any ideas?  NetGear
[05:01] <KnowledgEngi> *now=know
[05:01] <bruenig> KnowledgEngi, no, does that have something to do with software rosegarden, or is rosegarden the software you are looking for?
[05:01] <KnowledgEngi> i has install rosegarden
[05:02] <mikeo1> how do i raise the refresh rate available?
[05:02] <KnowledgEngi> but if i write the note in the score
[05:02] <snype> what package does nm-applet belong to
[05:02] <snype> like if i wanted to apt-get it?
[05:02] <VigoFusion> GionnyBoss: I spent like 20 minutes makeing a new ScreenSaver with a Ruby Core, my nephew Comp IT freaked out.

[05:04] <Kingsqueak> snype: there's also 'apt-cache search'
[05:04] <Kingsqueak> snype: 'apt-cache search network-manager'
[05:04] <KnowledgEngi> but i do not think that depent to this software
[05:04] <Lovloss> What do you do if you have an internal drive (20g) in ext2 format that isnt mounted on startup, but you want to be able to copy files to and from it
[05:04] <tritium> snype: just install network-manager-gnome
[05:04] <gop> :(
[05:04] <gop>  George B.

[05:04] <tritium> it'll depend on network-manager
[05:04] <KnowledgEngi> becouse this software under dapper did not give me problem
[05:04] <Lovloss> it doesnt mount
[05:04] <dabaR> Lovloss: you add it to /etc/fstab
[05:04] <panterozo> alguien entiende que chucha digo???
[05:04] <britt> im getting a old WYSE terminal sent to me in a couple of days. Is there any way I could get my PC to open a terminal to a com port so the WYSE terminal can connect to it?
[05:04] <Lovloss> ah. how

[05:05] <panterozo> alo???
[05:05] <GionnyBoss> mplayer mozilla plugin doesn't seem to work... I installed codecs and all this stuff... and if I write about:plugins in firefox I can see mplayer plugin... what's the problem? maybe a totem plugin conflict?
[05:05] <snype> joejaxx-- u using fglrx?
[05:05] <feross> panterozo: #ubuntu-es
[05:05] <tritium> panterozo: "alo" no es palabra
[05:05] <Lovloss> dabaR, is there a command?
[05:05] <NigelS> britt: can't you just connect to /dev/ttyXX
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> GionnyBoss: does just 'mplayer' play the same file if you download it?
[05:05] <britt> NigelS: ?
[05:05] <Kingsqueak> GionnyBoss: test that first
[05:05] <britt> the terminal is a dumb terminal
[05:06] <GionnyBoss> ok Kingsqueak, now I test that
[05:06] <britt> it'll be looking for a com port to connect to
[05:06] <britt> there's something i need to open with getty
[05:06] <Novagenesis> weee..nice and comfy in linux again...been months since i've had a stable linux install ;)
[05:06] <blaa> hi all
[05:06] <britt> but i dont remember which file i needed to edit
[05:06] <dabaR> Lovloss: well, that is a file, so you edit it. there is a mount command you could use to get a hang of it. For one, sudo fdisk -l will show you the device node of that particular drive. start with pasting output of that to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[05:06] <NigelS> britt: but I mean those are your com ports and what not
[05:06] <Novagenesis> if only there wasn't a nasty bug report about WoW dropping accounts using cedega
[05:06] <snype> anyone know a way for me to have something listen to the output of nm-applet and prompt me for an address then have it save that into a file?
[05:06] <VigoFusion> I just open a terminal and cpy/pste that FixVideo into it and done?
[05:06] <blaa> I have a problem with phpMyAdmin
[05:06] <Lovloss> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[05:07] <Lovloss> tlol
[05:07] <KnowledgEngi> i need to rebuild the kernel just modifing the timer frequency in the cpu configuration
[05:07] <britt> NigelS: yes. but opening the com port doesnt do me much good if i dont have a terminal on that port
[05:07] <mborohov> anyone gotten an ipod working with linux?
[05:07] <Kingsqueak> mborohov: gtkpod
[05:07] <mborohov> specifically, with amaroK or banshee?
[05:07] <KnowledgEngi> i need only one modific in the kernel
[05:07] <blaa> I installed it and  I removed it
[05:07] <KnowledgEngi> becouse all the rest work good
[05:07] <GionnyBoss> I can't find the link :S
[05:07] <will__> Hey all
[05:07] <snype> hi
[05:07] <NigelS> Novagenesis: take some of those with a pinch of salt, people have reported being banned for using cedega when it's really nothing of the sort.  one guy was whining about it but really it was because he'd programmed lots of macros
[05:07] <Lovloss> ok i posted it
[05:07] <Lovloss> what now
[05:07] <mborohov> Kingsqueak: what about banshee or amaroK?
[05:08] <feross> mborohov: yeah, works fine with banshee
[05:08] <dabaR> Lovloss: tell me the URL
[05:08] <Lovloss> hdb1 is the one i want
[05:08] <mborohov> doesnt work for me.
[05:08] <Kingsqueak> mborohov: never tried playing off mine, I've only used gtkpod to load it up
[05:08] <Novagenesis> NigelS:  well yeah..but it's on the transgaming news page..apparently there are some cases where it's verified noncheats
[05:08] <blaa> and removed phpmyadmin directory from /var/www
[05:08] <mborohov> it doesnt show up in banshee, sadly
[05:08] <Lovloss> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33387/
[05:08] <will__> Odd Problem here, I keep getting permission denied while trying to install Hellanzb
[05:08] <feross> mborohov: do you see the icon on the desktop?
[05:08] <will__> I'm the admin, so a bit confused.
[05:08] <dabaR> Lovloss: thanks. now tell me whether /media/hdb1 exists
[05:08] <Novagenesis> that and cedega keeps blowing up in my face for some reason
[05:08] <Lovloss> nope
[05:08] <Lovloss> i can make it exist
[05:08] <mborohov> yeah
[05:09] <mborohov> i do see the icon on the desktop
[05:09] <NigelS> Novagenesis: do you have a link?
[05:09] <dabaR> Lovloss: Ok, create it. Know how to do that?
[05:09] <Lovloss> mkdir
[05:09] <dabaR> Lovloss: ya, sorry, go ahead.
[05:09] <blaa> and installed it agian but i can't see phpmyadmin directory in /var/www
[05:09] <snype> quesiton lets say i go do "sudo apt-get remove firefox" then i get a msg that it no longer needs ubuntu-desktop and it'll get rid of that... will this break my system?
[05:09] <feross> mborohov: do you have the ipod in drive mode or whatever...
[05:09] <panterozo> Join the Team
[05:09] <blaa> how can i solve this problem?
[05:09] <GionnyBoss> it's very late here... I think I will try tomorrow with mplayer plugin... now I go to sleep... thanks for all your help!
[05:09] <mborohov> im not sure what that means
[05:09] <Novagenesis> NigelS: http://www.transgaming.com/subhilites.php but you need membership to see it i think
[05:09] <mborohov> i mean, i can _access_ the ipod
[05:10] <mborohov> but banshee doesnt recognize it
[05:10] <Lovloss> done
[05:10] <feross> mborohov: also, remember to eject the ipod before disconnecting
[05:10] <will__> what is a pgpkey?
[05:10] <Lovloss> whats next
=== vnux is now known as VinceNzo
[05:10] <will__> nm
[05:10] <Lovloss> should i just mount?
[05:10] <GionnyBoss> ah... last thing... can anybody suggest me a link to a tutorial on how to install Sun Java JDK with Netbeans? I need it to develop applications
=== VinceNzo is now known as VinceNz0
[05:10] <dabaR> Lovloss: now run sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 and see whether you can see the files on the drive with sudo ls, and with just ls.
[05:10] <tritium> !sunjava
[05:10] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[05:10] <VigoFusion> pgp is Pretty Good Privacy, it was a free Encryption tool from MIT,
[05:11] <will__> What owner is "1001"
[05:11] <mikeo1> how come i still cant up the resolution
[05:11] <Novagenesis> The history behind PGP is quite fantastic...saw a documentary on it once
[05:11] <mikeo1> i made the changes in xorg
[05:11] <dabaR> will__: that is likely you.
[05:11] <mikeo1> but in the screen res utility it wont let me choose higher
[05:11] <feross> mborohov: hmm don't know what to tell you, I plugged my friends ipod in the other day and it just worked. didn't have to do anything, the only thing I remember is that he mentioned he put the ipod in drive mode or something like that.
[05:11] <joejaxx> snype: no i am not i am using the open ati drivers with a ATI Radeon 7500
[05:11] <tritium> will__: the first user added to the system, which, as dabaR pointed out, is likely you
[05:11] <Lovloss> I can see the files on it yes
[05:11] <Lovloss> it mounts correctly
[05:11] <will__> Yes, but I cant delete this folder?
[05:12] <dabaR> will__: the first user created, you can find this out by checking your /etc/passwd file.
[05:12] <VigoFusion> MIT no longer has it, PGP was bought by , no cussing here, but you can still get it free for windows, it is an excallent program.
[05:12] <will__> tritium,  well i cant delete the folder
[05:12] <snype> anyone here use ubuntu in cluster? or no anything about clusters? cause i wanna cluster my two thinkpads together if possible
[05:12] <DarkMageZ> anyone know how to change the size of the icons on the desktop?
[05:12] <will__> I installed it, and created 1 user.
[05:12] <will__> me
[05:12] <dabaR> Lovloss: so we can now mount this file with the command, and you would like it to mount when you boot?
[05:12] <tritium> will__: are you using the wrong command?
[05:12] <GionnyBoss> so java from sun is included in repos? incredible :)
[05:12] <Pelo> how do I get changes in xorg.conf to star without restarting the comp ?  I change mouse stuff ,  cmd line please
[05:12] <Lovloss> well first off, how come i have no permissions within the mount?
[05:12] <Lovloss> oh maybe i should chown it
[05:13] <moyote> mikeo1, have u tried a reboot?
[05:13] <dabaR> Lovloss: OK, so you can only see the files with the root?
[05:13] <will__> tritium, : i'm physically clicking on the folder and trying to move it to the trash
[05:13] <Lovloss> i can see them. i just cant edit
[05:13] <mikeo1> why would a reboot affect it

[05:13] <faranda> hi there...  how to uninstall zope 2.10 source code in ubuntu edgy?
[05:13] <Lovloss> chown doesnt work.
[05:13] <dabaR> Lovloss: we should find the right mount option. so unmount it, then mount with this sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 -ousers
[05:14] <mikeo1> restarting xorg didnt help at all and it is somehow getting the list of available settnigs from somewhere else
[05:14] <moyote> I've had that problem before, who knows why, but the resolution wouldn't change. Once in a while a reboot fixes it? How did you change the resolution?
[05:14] <will__> the "Examples" folder is locked as well :\
[05:14] <dabaR> faranda: you installed it with make install?
[05:14] <mikeo1> i was using the tools in gnome
[05:14] <Lovloss> ok what did ousers do?
[05:14] <Lovloss> oh! i have permissions
[05:14] <dabaR> Lovloss: well it allows all users to mount it. not sure whether this will help...
[05:14] <moyote> mikeo1, does the resolution you want show up in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[05:14] <faranda> dabaR: yep....
[05:14] <dabaR> Lovloss: I guess it did:)
[05:15] <mikeo1> yes
[05:15] <mikeo1> but not at the refresh rate
[05:15] <Lovloss> K, now how do i set it to be treated like any other mountable drive?
[05:15] <tritium> will__: Examples is a symlink will full permissions.  You should be able to remove it.
[05:15] <feross> Pelo: haha.. well :)
[05:15] <will__> tritium, I cant. WHere did I make a mistake?
[05:15] <FFForever> !flash9
[05:15] <ubotu> You can download Flash Player 9 Beta here: http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/custom/ (replace dapper-seveas with edgy-seveas for Edgy) - Official Adobe page at http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[05:15] <feross> Pelo: I was about to mention it but you were gone by then.
[05:15] <dabaR> faranda: not sure how to uninstall it now, but I would like to recommend checkinstall for the future, which creates a .deb package and installs it, that way you can just use apt to uninstall it afterwards. it is used at the make install step, you just sudo checkinstall instead. you need to insatll checkinsatll first.
[05:16] <moyote> mikeo1, Have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[05:16] <tritium> will__: need more info
[05:16] <mikeo1> nope
[05:16] <dabaR> Lovloss: you mean to mount at boot?
[05:16] <will__> Tristan, : I am the only user. I installed ubuntu myself.
[05:16] <Lovloss> ya
[05:16] <will__> yet examples has a lock on it
[05:16] <Lovloss> id love for it to automount in a way where i dont have to mess wih permissions
[05:16] <john> when changing the default port for apache2 is there another file that needs to be modifed as well?
[05:16] <dabaR> Lovloss: well, that is done in the /etc/fstab file, please open it for editing, and paste its contents to the pastebin so I can see what needs to be done
[05:16] <GionnyBoss> now I go to sleep
[05:17] <Pelo> nighty night

[05:23] <will__> dabaR,  "root" is the owner.
[05:23] <feross> FFForever: download the plugin tar.gz, extract it and copy the file to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
[05:23] <mikeo1> too bad gnome still cant change it
[05:23] <mborohov> yay, upgrade to 6.10 is almost done
[05:23] <will__> why is ROOT different than Will :\
[05:23] <will__> as if ROOT is a user.
[05:24] <moyote> mikeo1, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.
[05:24] <nn> Where does NSS crypto come from?
[05:24] <Pelo> will is not important enough,  ubu doesnT' deal with underlings
[05:24] <nn> checking for NSS... configure: error: could not find NSS Crypto libraries
[05:24] <moyote> mikeo1, what video card are you using?
[05:24] <dabaR> will__: that is why the drag and drop of the folder icon does not work.
[05:24] <mikeo1> lol onboard gf4 mx
[05:24] <dabaR> will__: it is a user.
[05:24] <FFForever> do i need the xpt?
[05:24] <mikeo1> with 128vram
[05:24] <kitche> nn: from libnss I think is what ubuntu calls it

[05:24] <moyote> hmmmm...
[05:24] <sandy16> jeojaxx, has any idea how ?
[05:25] <moyote> well......
[05:25] <mikeo1> it can run all the opengl screensavers good

[05:25] <will__> dabaR, : I didnt create it... nor did I create "1001"
[05:25] <mikeo1> and the xmms opengl plugins
[05:25] <will__> How do I loging as 1001 or ROOT.
[05:25] <Kingsqueak> dabaR: blkid /dev/sda1    as an example
[05:25] <mikeo1> and videos and flash player 9
[05:25] <pyro> does anyone know the compression ratio of ogg vs mp3?
[05:25] <Lovloss> dabaR, did you see the paste?
[05:25] <nn> kitche, Negative
[05:25] <dabaR> Lovloss: let us try http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33391/
[05:25] <pyro> guess it depends on what bitrate...
[05:25] <moyote> mikeo1, well, you can try. ;-)
[05:25] <snype> anyone know of a n64 emulator for linux?
[05:25] <feross> FFForever: no, it's the libflashplugin.so
[05:25] <grndslm> pyro...it just varies
[05:25] <mikeo1> lol i did many times and failed
[05:25] <Lovloss> eep ^_^ thanks
[05:26] <dabaR> Kingsqueak: thank you.
[05:26] <pyro> grndslm: yeah i figured
[05:26] <mikeo1> cant figure out whats up with the aiglx and all that otherstuff
[05:26] <grndslm> pyro, mp3s could be cbr or vbr, while oggs are pretty much all vbr
[05:26] <mikeo1> kept getting some composite errors when i would run beryl
[05:26] <Kingsqueak> dabaR: no problem, was meaning to figger that one out myself and kept forgetting
[05:26] <mikeo1> like glx composite not found or something
[05:26] <joejaxx> sandy16: i do not know in that situation
[05:26] <Lovloss> dabaR, should i coppy whats in the small box so i dont get the line numbers?
[05:26] <pyro> grndslm: I dont know much about the difference of cbr/vbr
[05:26] <dabaR> Lovloss: just copy and paste the last line, it is the only change
[05:27] <dabaR> Lovloss: without line numbers, for sure.
[05:27] <FFForever> ok done
[05:27] <FFForever> i dont have sound
[05:27] <FFForever> when i go to youtube and play the random vid :-\
[05:27] <grndslm> constant bit rate versus variable bit rate....vbr is always better....saves space when necessary, and doesn't slack on the quality parts of the music!
[05:27] <nn> kitche, Attempting to build CoolKey so that i can use my CAC card in linux ;)
[05:27] <pyro> grndslm: ah yes, i recall that now
[05:28] <Lovloss> dabaR, will this automatically show up on my desktop or will i have to hunt it down under media
[05:28] <dabaR> will__: 1001 is how the computer knows about will, computers care little for names, more for numbers. where did you see the 1001 anyhow? to remove root's files and directories, use the sudo command.
[05:28] <pyro> im thinking ill convert my entire mp3 collection to ogg
=== rqm is now known as InkChild
[05:28] <dabaR> !sudo| will__
[05:28] <ubotu> will__: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:28] <nn> kitche, seems the answer is mozilla-nss sources and hacking the configure.in to look for mozilla-nss instead of nss :)
[05:28] <InkChild> hello?
[05:28] <dabaR> Lovloss: we will see
[05:28] <feross> FFForever: ohh, that was supposed to be fixed with this latest version
[05:28] <Lovloss> okay, well thanks!
[05:28] <kitche> nn: yeah that could be it I just know that a couple of distros just call it nss :)
[05:28] <Lovloss> im going to reboot.
[05:28] <dabaR> Lovloss: no

[05:29] <dex`> good
[05:29] <pyro> ok bbs :)
[05:29] <Lovloss> how come i cant save the file
[05:29] <dabaR> will__: good
[05:29] <will__> dabaR, : so it will always look LOCKED in the gui?
[05:29] <InkChild> may i ask for help with some task
[05:29] <dabaR> FFForever: explain about the issue
[05:29] <dabaR> !helpme
[05:29] <InkChild> merging video files?
[05:29] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:29] <stfn> do Bug Buddy reports appear anywhere public?  after submitting a report, Bug Buddy "encountered and error while submitting..." specifically "The component specified doesn't exist or has been renamed.  Please upgrade to the latest version."  but the "component" is Gnumeric (in main) and the version is 1.7.0 (in edgy)
[05:29] <sky123> In ubuntu what is the equivalent for ctime? ie command to find creation time of a file??

[05:30] <stfn> sky123: stat give access, modification, and change times...
[05:30] <FFForever> but i get sound in other things
[05:31] <dabaR> Lovloss: you have to edit the file with sudo
[05:31] <melot> FFForever: i think you need do download plugins
[05:31] <InkChild> Does anyone know how to merge/join two avi video files?
[05:31] <Lovloss> how do i do that, lol. i suck :(
[05:31] <stfn> er, "stat gives" (man 1 stat)
[05:31] <Lovloss> oh wait, ill gksudo it
[05:31] <FFForever> what plugins?
[05:31] <sky123> but the creation time...i know there is ctime..but cant find it on the box?

[05:32] <FlyCaster> hello.... I installed Ubuntu 6.10 about two weeks ago on a Compaq Presario 5304 (255 Mhz Pentium) and it recognizes one HD but not the WD 5.1GB i have on hdb.  How do I mount it?  I can see it using Gnome Partition Editor, but can't see it any other way.
[05:33] <F28> Where can i find a guide to installing a new Desktop Enviroment?
[05:33] <melot> FFForever: did you use automatix?
[05:33] <Kingsqueak> F28: which one, in what context?
[05:33] <FFForever> automatix?
[05:33] <F28> KDE
[05:33] <dabaR> will__: you can chown the Examples directory to yourself, if you wish to keep that particular dir and do not want the lock on it...
[05:33] <FFForever> what is that?
[05:33] <stalefries> F28: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop
[05:33] <InkChild> FlyCaster if you can see it in gparted, what device name does it have?
[05:33] <stalefries> !automatix
[05:33] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[05:33] <melot> its sort of installer in ubuntu
[05:33] <F28> Not hooked up to the internet
[05:34] <Lovloss> dabaR, i have changed the file, unmounted the drive, and i did 'mount -a'
[05:34] <melot> it might help you
[05:34] <stalefries> F28: then tough luck :(
[05:34] <F28> :(
[05:34] <dabaR> Lovloss: and it did not complain? can you edit the files now?
[05:34] <F28> Thnx
[05:34] <Lovloss> dabar it worked normally, but it didnt appear on desktop
[05:34] <gbu> Hello.Where does synaptic save the programs i download?
[05:34] <stalefries> melot: Automatix = bad, or at least not recommended
[05:34] <dabaR> Lovloss: do other drives appear on the desktop?
[05:35] <stalefries> melot: !easyubuntu is recommended now
[05:35] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  I think it showed it as hdb in Gnome partition editor, but I can't see itusing Kwikdisk, or any of my file managers.
[05:35] <Lovloss> Cds do. Or at least it should show in my "disk mount" tool
[05:35] <melot> ahh ill check it out
[05:35] <Lovloss> if i link to it from my desktop, should that work?
[05:35] <melot> thanks stalefries
[05:36] <InkChild> FlyCaster: see if you have it, ls /dev/hdb
[05:36] <dabaR> Lovloss: well, yes, that would likely work, but there is also a nautilus option in gconf-editor for showing drives on the desktop. Is it in your places menu?
[05:36] <InkChild> FlyCaster: should output something
[05:36] <Lovloss> actually im not going to worry about it, its just a backup drive
[05:36] <nn> WOOOHOO
[05:36] <Lovloss> ill just hold stuff on it
[05:36] <dabaR> gbu: /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:36] <stalefries> nn: something good?
[05:36] <melot> anyone here uses download accelerators?
[05:36] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  I am aa relative newbie to Linux.  I will try using a shell....
[05:37] <Lovloss> k. cya guys, thanks again
[05:37] <nn> stalefries, Yes. Got DoD (Army/Navy/Air Force) CAC cards working in ubuntu
[05:37] <dabaR> Lovloss: OK. It should work from now on when you reboot, the mount -a command is like a reboot of mounting:)
[05:37] <dabaR> Lovloss: welcoe
[05:37] <InkChild> flycaster: oh yeah that, it's safe, don't worry
[05:37] <Lovloss> ok ^_^ thanks
[05:37] <stalefries> nn: cool, dunno what those are :)
[05:37] <nn> stalefries, smart card ID cards
[05:37] <feross> melot: downthemall is a good dl tool or qtbittorrent

[05:37] <InkChild> FlyCaster: wish i could gui you into it but shell will do
[05:38] <stalefries> nn: ooh, fancy
[05:38] <nn> stalefries, Common Access Card, our new ID cards have a smart card feature with a neato PKI system in place for global authentication

[05:39] <Pablo_C> what is it VigoFusion ?
[05:39] <LineOf7s> Howdy peeps.  I have one issue that's preventing me from rolling out a half-dozen Ubuntu boxes instead of WinXP ones - and that's configuring the keymapping of the terminal (any kind).  Anyone have any pointers?  Google's keeping most of it to herself.  :o\
[05:39] <stalefries> nn: yay for initiative!
[05:40] <dabaR> EnsilZah: post /etc/apt/sources.list to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[05:40] <InkChild> FlyCaster: ??
[05:40] <shawnr_> Can anyone direct me to a wiki/tutorial on setting up a local "shared" folder between users on the the same box?
[05:40] <madman91> POLL: who has a nokia n73
[05:40] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  using "terminal" I get nothing either for hda or hdb.  it just prints /dev/hdb with the background black.
[05:40] <nn> stalefries, took some work, but i'm determined to learn Italian, and my access to Rosetta stone is via CAC card :)
[05:40] <stalefries> shawnr_: just make the folder readable and writable by everyone
[05:40] <_kalm> does anyone else here have problems with having the wireless (wlan0, rt61 drivers) to STAY up/online
[05:40] <InkChild> FlyCaster: haha that's it
[05:40] <feross> LineOf7s: System>Preferences>Keyboard
[05:40] <VigoFusion> Pablo_C: It is the same one, sorta, the files and repositories are listed on the Ubuntu page for your distro.
[05:40] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  so how do i mount it?  mount /dev/hdb?
[05:41] <Pablo_C> hmm
[05:41] <InkChild> FlyCaster: typing "ls /dev/hdb" should output "/dev/hdb", yes but try...
[05:41] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion,  i am using edgy
[05:41] <dabaR> LineOf7s: I do not know much about it, but try man -k map and look through the available commands.
[05:41] <shawnr_> stalefries, but if one user creates a file in the folder, the file still has different rights than the folder its in.
[05:41] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion, what is it called?
[05:41] <InkChild> FlyCaster: "cd /media" first
[05:41] <LineOf7s> feross:  thanks, but that doesn't seem to cut it.  I need the terminal to emulate a VT320 - which means the top four keys of the numeric keypad become PF1 - PF4.  This is the showstopper.
[05:41] <stalefries> shawnr_: hmm. Educate users?
[05:41] <LineOf7s> ty dabaR - I'll have another look.
[05:41] <VigoFusion> Pablo_C: There is also a Star_Field, science app, Map, Global View, lotsa fun stuff. let me see if I can locate for you.
[05:42] <FFForever> i cant see text in flash?
=== darkmatter is now known as Steve_Ballmer
[05:42] <InkChild> FlyCaster: once there try "ls hdb" should output "hdb"
[05:42] <gbu> I can't find it in home
[05:42] <shawnr_> stalefries, would rather not have to change permissions on every file written into the folder
[05:42] <dabaR> shawnr_: make their umasks have nice group permissions, and put them in the same group.
[05:42] <kodat> hey which torrent client do you guys use ?
[05:42] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion, ok thank you ;)
[05:42] <KnowledgEngi> sudo apt-get install linux-tree
[05:42] <zack_> kodat: utorrent ;)
[05:42] <KnowledgEngi> apt do not find linux-tree
[05:42] <stalefries> kodat: either the built-in gnome bottorrent or utorrent in wine
[05:42] <kodat> ah so you use wine
[05:42] <KnowledgEngi> why???
[05:42] <InkChild> FlyCaster: if it doesn't it means you dont have a /media/hdb folder
[05:42] <feross> FFForever:  in the firefox addressbar type... about:plugins  see what version of flash you're running
[05:43] <gbu> Where does apt-get normally install files in ubuntu?
[05:43] <kodat> i guess i should install wine
[05:43] <kodat> alright thanks ~
[05:43] <dabaR> gbu: can't find what? the directory is /var/cache/apt/archives for installation files. try ls /var/cache/apt/archives
[05:43] <kodat> azureus sucks so bad on ubuntu heh
[05:43] <InkChild> FlyCaster: so create it with "sudo mkdir hdb"
[05:43] <atarinox>  does anyone know of a program which will scan for wireless
[05:43] <atarinox>                   networks in the area and show me a list of em?
[05:43] <feross> kodat: try qbittorrent
[05:43] <Pelo> kodat,   utorrent on wine
=== Steve_Ballmer is now known as darkmatter
[05:43] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  right.  says "no such file or directory.
[05:43] <dabaR> gbu: files get installed in different places depending on the package you install. Do you have a more specific question, about a particular package?
[05:44] <InkChild> FlyCaster: then create it
[05:44] <kodat> Pelo, i use to use bitcomet when i was with windows..was so much b etter than azureus..never used utorrent though
[05:44] <Jordan_U> gbu: I am not qite sure what you mean, it installs them where they need to go.
[05:44] <dabaR> atarinox: network-manager-gnome
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/CompilazioneKernel?highlight=%28kernel%29
[05:44] <InkChild> FlyCaster:  it will ask for a password, that'd be your normal system password
[05:44] <Pelo> kodat,  ut is so much better then bc
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> sudo apt-get linux-tree
[05:44] <kodat> Pelo, ill give it a whirl
[05:44] <gbu> Where does apt-get normally usually save files in ubuntu?
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> apt-get do not find linux-tree
[05:44] <KnowledgEngi> why?
[05:44] <Jordan_U> gbu: Use wheris < commandName > for information on where individual programs are installed.
[05:44] <F28> Does Ubunto have a ROOT password?
[05:44] <dabaR> gbu: which files?
[05:45] <F28> **ubuntu
[05:45] <InkChild> f28 no it is disabled by default
[05:45] <dabaR> !root| F28
[05:45] <ubotu> F28: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[05:45] <F28> kk
[05:45] <kodat> Pelo, wish i could get beryl to work..i reinstalled linux today after all the messed up stuff i did to it..works so much better. not to mention i got my wireless up within 5 minutes this time haha
[05:45] <VigoFusion> pablo_C: Starfield is http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-162158.html
[05:45] <FlyCaster> inkchild.  says can't find media.  (after I did the Mkdir and then tried to mount)
[05:45] <InkChild> f28 you can get a root shell with "sudo -s"
[05:45] <Pelo> kodat,  I don't know anything about beryl
[05:45] <Pablo_C> ty VigoFusion
[05:45] <kodat> Pelo, no biggie, beryl was just good fun
[05:46] <Gizzle> Hello all, what is the difference between totem-gstreamer and totem-xine?  Which one should i install and how?
[05:46] <InkChild> FlyCaster: try "sudo mount -vt auto /dev/hdb hdb"
[05:46] <Pelo> kodat  http://www.securenet.net/members/jeanpelo/linux_guide.html
[05:46] <FloK> hi. Is it possible to scp when the dest is only root writable and how?
[05:46] <dabaR> gbu: to get a sense of the various places packages install files, run sudo dpkg -L zenity
[05:46] <kitche> Gizzle: the engines that they use one uses xine the other uses gstreamer
[05:46] <kodat> Pelo, how would i get the 0.9.24..i hope theres an option
[05:46] <InkChild> FlyCaster: or try "sudo mount -vt auto /dev/hdb /media/hdb"
[05:46] <stalefries> Gizzle: they're both backends for the totem movie plyer, which you install is your choice.
[05:46] <Jordan_U> kodat: #ubuntu-xgl and #beryl have more people with XGL / AIGLX /compiz / beryl skills :)
[05:46] <slicky> are there any solution on how to make 3d acceleration work with xorg and ATI drivers?  i cant find any help on google
[05:46] <Pelo> kodat,  hold on
[05:46] <FFForever>     File name: libflashplayer.so   Shockwave Flash 7.0 r68
[05:46] <FloK> IMO the missing root user is trouble in this case
[05:47] <InkChild> FlyCaster: you know you can edit the last line in the shell tapping the "up" key right?
[05:47] <kodat> Jordan_U, nobody ever answers in there, i already tried haha
[05:47] <Kingsqueak> FloK: I think you're right
[05:47] <Jordan_U> !fglrx | slicky
[05:47] <ubotu> slicky: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:47] <Gizzle> stalefries and kitche ,,, ok thanks
[05:47] <Pelo> kodat,  http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/index.html
[05:47] <slicky> Jordan_U:  been there done that
[05:47] <InkChild> !help nvidia
[05:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about help nvidia - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:47] <InkChild> !nvidia
[05:47] <zack_> hey, i'm trying to get GFTP to only show files which don't end in the tilde (~) - how do i make this rule and put it in the Filespec function?
[05:47] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[05:47] <FloK> Kingsqueak, so you also havent found any solution to this prob?
[05:47] <Jordan_U> kodat: What exactly is the problem with beryl?
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> FloK: though really, you shouldn't leave root ssh enabled, ideally you would have a process user that does the transfer and something to pick up the files on the receiving end, maybe a root run process to fix it
[05:48] <slicky> Jordan_U: "model number for your Radeon card is a 9700 pro or above"  and my is 9600 :\
[05:48] <Kingsqueak> FloK: nope
[05:48] <kodat> Jordan_U, i would have no borders on anything, then it would freeze within a couple seconds after i loaded it
[05:48] <InkChild> FlyCaster: what's taking you so long? If it's not a problem to ask
[05:48] <mborohov> hey guys
[05:48] <mborohov> i got the ipod working
[05:48] <mborohov> how do i add more workspaces?
[05:48] <dabaR> mborohov: to gnome?
[05:48] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  ot sure what I did, but it gave me a bunch of print about naming file systems etc.
[05:48] <Pelo> mborohov,  congrats
[05:48] <kodat> Jordan_U, and that even after following all instructions on every forum heh
[05:49] <Pelo> mborohov,  just rightlick on the workspace icon in the panel > properties
[05:49] <FlyCaster> Inkchild.  I have a slow computer and am trying all this stuff as we go.
[05:49] <mborohov> dabaR: yes
[05:49] <InkChild> FlyCaster: ok it means the option auto didn't autodetect the file system type
[05:49] <dabaR> mborohov: to the little panel applet in the bottom right, do what pelo says above
[05:49] <mborohov> sweet
[05:49] <InkChild> FlyCaster: ok
[05:49] <mborohov> this is awesome
[05:49] <InkChild> FlyCaster: try this...
[05:49] <Jbo> I'm trying to get into ubuntu to run a PVR with mythtv.  I have a pci express video card that is connected to my television via composite cables and ubuntu LIVECD cannot display anything.  I was told to use ubuntu alternative, which at least comes up and tries to install, but when I get to partitioning my HD it craps out on me.  I have a 320 gig SATA 3.0 HD. I'm really not sure what what else to do, any sugguestions?
[05:49] <mborohov> now if i can only get some nice transparency :p
[05:50] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion, is that mapping stars?
[05:50] <VigoFusion> Pablo_C: Street Maps?
[05:50] <InkChild> FlyCaster: sudo mount -vt vfat /dev/hdb /media/hdb
[05:50] <Jordan_U> slicky: Does the "ATI" ( open source radeon ) driver work?
[05:50] <Pablo_C> I want streets in north america
[05:50] <FFForever> how do i make wmv's play in firefox?
[05:50] <Pelo> mborohov,  for that you want beryl I beleive
[05:50] <VigoFusion> http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/edgy/
[05:50] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion, yes :P
[05:50] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  I think hda is one file type and hdb is Reiser
[05:51] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  left over from another (DSL) HD installation
[05:51] <malt> anyone here use ddclient?
[05:51] <mborohov> beryl?
[05:51] <InkChild> FlyCaster: in gparted what type of filesystem it says hdb is?
[05:51] <zack_> can anyone help me with the Filespec in GFTP?
[05:51] <VigoFusion> Pablo_C: that is the Edgy , the lists are at the top of that site for other distros
[05:51] <mborohov> not compiz?
=== pianoboy3333 is now known as poop
[05:51] <Kingsqueak> malt: have you looked at this yet?  http://ddclient.sourceforge.net/#help
[05:52] <Pelo> mborohov,  beryl is a fork or compiz
=== poop is now known as pianoboy3333
[05:52] <zack_> i've tried looking up docs on the GFTP filespec on google but there's nothing...
[05:52] <mborohov> is beryl relatively stable?
[05:52] <malt> Kingsqueak: isn't this insecure for the domain for it to save a password in the config for a server
[05:52] <slicky> Jordan_U: hm.. i thing so?
[05:52] <pianoboy3333> mborohov: yes...ish
[05:52] <malt> Kingsqueak it use any encryption?
[05:52] <Kingsqueak> malt: you should chown the file 600 for the user that runs the process
[05:52] <mborohov> mmm...that ish scares me a little =\
[05:53] <ixian_> ive had beryl crash/freeze on me several times.. but its cool looking
[05:53] <Kingsqueak> malt: that way other users can't read it
[05:53] <zack_> Beryl would be good if you didn't have to resize windows smaller to stop them appearing black
[05:53] <InkChild> FlyCaster: try sudo mount -vt raiserfs /dev/hdb /media/hdb
[05:53] <Pablo_C> VigoFusion, thanks mate
[05:53] <InkChild> FlyCaster: does it fly?
[05:53] <dabaR> InkChild: the /dev/hdb is always gonna have a number at the end too
[05:53] <slicky> Jordan_U:  hm.. i dont think iv got the resctricted-modules installed..
[05:54] <VigoFusion> Pablo_C: My pleasure if I helped you I helped myself.
[05:54] <slicky> Jordan_U: how do i findout if i do have them?
[05:54] <InkChild> dabaR: mega-DU'H that's rite!!!
[05:54] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  "wrong fs, after several tries.
[05:54] <InkChild> FlyCaster: hey listen
[05:54] <dabaR> InkChild: you can find out partition info with sudo fdisk -l
[05:54] <InkChild> FlyCaster: try sudo mount -vt raiserfs /dev/hdb0 /media/hdb
[05:55] <InkChild> dabaR: got it
[05:55] <FlyCaster> Inkchild. ok
[05:55] <InkChild> FlyCaster: dabaR is right, it is not hdb is hdb0 or hdb1 etc... if that device has one partition it will be hdb0

[05:56] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  I think I got something using hdb1 to /media/hdb
[05:56] <nn> How do i contribute a package? :)
[05:56] <dabaR> InkChild: more likely hdb1
[05:56] <dabaR> nn: visit #ubuntu-motu
[05:56] <Jordan_U> slicky: search for restricted modules in synaptic and see if it is checked.
[05:56] <nn> dabaR, thanks

[05:57] <dabaR> InkChild: find out with sudo fdisk -l
[05:57] <InkChild> dabaR: is reiser for the whole disk isn't it?
[05:57] <FlyCaster> Inkchld:  I had it formatted & partitioned as hdb1  Now let me see if I can see it in other programs....
[05:57] <syntaxx> dabaR: i added beryl-manager in the session as the guides told me to do.. now when i logout and log back in my X freeze
[05:57] <dabaR> FFForever: read the restricted formats page already:) the package you need is libxine-extracodecs

[06:01] <slicky> Jordan_U: kk w8
[06:01] <Vich> how to remove a driver?
[06:01] <Vich> :S
[06:01] <dabaR> syntaxx: try gnome-session-remove in a console
[06:01] <Vich> it's causing my system to lockup at startup
[06:01] <syntaxx> dabaR: ok
[06:01] <Vich> I had to remove the card
[06:01] <Vich> and reboot
[06:01] <arepie> Vich: what card?
[06:01] <slicky> Jordan_U:  http://83.249.37.33/xorg.conf
[06:02] <dabaR> Acu: it downloads the php instead of processing it on the server?
[06:02] <syntaxx> dabaR: it says cannot open display
[06:02] <VigoFusion> llnkChild: And spend a moment or three at that site he explains all about the Care Ware ideal, and has some very neat programs, and yes they are free, but you are asked to care.
[06:02] <Acu> dabaR: yes
[06:02] <InkChild> FlyCaster: hda3 is likely to be your swap, if system is linux it is ext3
[06:02] <FlyCaster> Inkchild:  /dev/hdb1               1         627     5036346   83  Linux
[06:02] <Vich> a dlink wireless card
[06:02] <zoople> Hi guys. Is there a good guide i can read to get me up and going for making dynamic websites in Ubuntu?
[06:02] <InkChild> so it is ext3 possibly ext2
[06:02] <kayxray> PHP?
[06:02] <Vich> zoople, depends on language
[06:03] <Vich> php isn't the only solution
[06:03] <slicky> Jordan_U:  do i have to add a module to the .conf file?
[06:03] <InkChild> FlyCaster: givme 30 seconds
[06:03] <zoople> aiming at PHP/mySQL
[06:03] <Vich> but it's a good one
[06:03] <kayxray> :)
[06:03] <Jordan_U> slicky: Why do you have 2 "Section "Device" " s ?
[06:03] <kayxray> I'm a mind reader Vich.
[06:03] <zoople> yeah, im fairly new at all this, so PHP is to my liking
[06:03] <Vich> well grab apache, php and mysql (server)
[06:03] <InkChild> FlyCaster: ok try this
[06:03] <Vich> and try looking at www.php.net
[06:03] <dabaR> Acu: did you install php support for apache?
[06:03] <FlyCaster> inkchild:  hda1 & 3 are ext2  hdb1 is reiserfs, i think.
[06:03] <slicky> Jordan_U:  hm.. iv got a tv-out card
[06:03] <Vich> they have really good doco
[06:03] <Vich> especially for functions
[06:03] <zoople> Vich: am i confused to have thought that Ubuntu came with some sort of SL inbuilt?
[06:03] <InkChild> FlyCaster: no it isn't look...
[06:04] <Vich> SL = scripting language?
[06:04] <zoople> *SQL
[06:04] <InkChild> FlyCaster: 83  Linux means ext3
[06:04] <zoople> sorri meant SQL
[06:04] <Vich> I don't think it does
[06:04] <nn> libnspr4-dev seems to be busted as it forces auto removal of mozilla-firefox and a bunch of other packages, which depend on libnspr4 :(
[06:04] <Jordan_U> slicky: ATI ( on the TV out card ) ?
[06:04] <zoople> ok thanks :)
[06:04] <Vich> ;)
[06:04] <Acu> dabaR: I downloaded some modules - I am not sure I did the right ones - I will check again
[06:04] <mborohov> alright
[06:04] <zoople> now, what is the best Website Creattion tool?
[06:04] <slicky> Jordan_U:  it a radeon ati with tv out..yes
[06:04] <zoople> and dont say jEdit :p
[06:04] <mborohov> so now that the ipod works
[06:04] <Vich> depends if you want wysiwyg or plain text
[06:04] <Vich> I use scite
[06:04] <InkChild> FlyCaster:  if hdb1 83 Linux it should be ext3
[06:05] <Pelo> zoople,  nvu is easy enough
[06:05] <Vich> which is a simple text editor
[06:05] <FlyCaster> inkchild:....hmmmmm   memory must be bad.  There isn't anything on it, so I can reformat it any way I wish at this point, if it would help.
[06:05] <Vich> with syntax highlighting for php
[06:05] <zoople> im looking more wysiwyg
[06:05] <InkChild> FlyCaster: did you mounted it?
[06:05] <zoople> so, im looking for a dreamweaver equivalent really
[06:05] <Vich> ah
[06:05] <Jordan_U> slicky: Why are you using fglrx for one and ATI for the other?
[06:05] <maurox> nvu then
[06:05] <InkChild> FlyCaster: are you sure?
[06:05] <Vich> fine, don't wait for my informative answer
[06:05] <FlyCaster> I entered the commands you gave me, so I assume it mounted.
[06:06] <FFForever> what will my thumbdrive be in /dev/?
[06:06] <slicky> Jordan_U:  i dont know.. iv just installed it.. it like a standard conf
[06:06] <VigoFusion> I always like Aracnoid, free, open source, can be WYSIWG or as complex as you wanna go.
[06:06] <Pelo> FFForever,  more likely in /media/
[06:06] <FFForever> auto launcher isnt comming up
=== Shadow_mil2 is now known as Shadow_mil
[06:07] <Ghost_Printer> !Firestarter
[06:07] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[06:07] <dabaR> syntaxx: I can only think of logging into X with a different session, then running the gnome-session-properties from the terminal
[06:07] <InkChild> FlyCaster: so? are you sure it has no format?
[06:07] <dabaR> syntaxx: actually, that will not work.
[06:07] <syntaxx> dabaR: hmm ok
[06:07] <syntaxx> dabaR: =/
[06:07] <InkChild> FlyCaster: if it says Linux it should be formated, with ext3
[06:08] <dabaR> syntaxx: since the session will not be running.
[06:08] <mikeo1> the upgrade manager actually worked this time
[06:08] <dabaR> syntaxx: but maybe you could then try the gnome-session-remove, try a different session, do you have any other wms insatlled?
[06:08] <mikeo1> and only 19 min left to download all the updates
[06:08] <syntaxx> dabaR: none
[06:08] <mikeo1> lol it didnt fniish upgrading
[06:08] <FlyCaster> inkchild:  not sure of anything about it at this poing.  I may not have used it with DSL linux.  But had used it with a version of Mepis, but it was really slow.  So I uninstalled Mepis and played with DSL until I got this Ubuntu 6.10 and I really like it on this computer.
[06:08] <dabaR> syntaxx: install openbox, if you want, quickly, it has just 2 packages
[06:09] <syntaxx> dabaR: ok
[06:09] <Jordan_U> slicky: OK, I am not verry good with xorg editing, backup your current xorg.conf and run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh   When it asks you for a driver choose "fglrx" , and be sure you know how to restore your backup xorg from the terminal in case this doesn't work.
[06:09] <dabaR> syntaxx: well, I just tried that too, and it does not work.
[06:09] <InkChild> FlyCaster: well firstly step back from /media/hdb, type cd by itself now
[06:09] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk ill try
[06:10] <VigoFusion> So if I have Edgy general/generic, non server, I have to install a Firewall?
[06:10] <syntaxx> sweet!
[06:10] <FlyCaster> inkchild:  let me go play a while and will return with more questions......  You helped me figure out a lot so far.  will play starting with cd and the next step you suggest, then return.
[06:10] <InkChild> FlyCaster: sudo mount -vt ext3 /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb
[06:10] <mikeo1> hopefully with edgy it will be easy to get xgl to work
[06:10] <mikeo1> or rather beryl and aiglx
[06:10] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk done.. now reboot?
[06:10] <carpediem> I have beryl on edgy.  Wasn't totally easy though.
[06:11] <mikeo1> i have beryl on edgy on dual screen at my computer in my dorm room at college, but right now im on the junky server in my basement at home :(
[06:11] <Acu> dabaR: do you know what module should be loaded for php and apache (there are 20 of them) ?
[06:11] <Jordan_U> slicky: No, just press ctrl + alt + backspace , you almost never need to reboot in linux :)
[06:11] <FlyCaster> inkchild:  says it is already mounted.
[06:11] <mikeo1> or /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:11] <Pelo> g'night folks
[06:11] <mikeo1> or killall gdm
[06:12] <dabaR> Acu: well, you need a package called libapache2-php5 or something.
[06:12] <cmweb> Does anyone here know how to make scripts for the Supybot ptogram..... I need to make some for my channel
[06:12] <FlyCaster> inkchild.  but I had used the reiserfs in the command the last time I tried it.  do I need to unmount it first and try again?
[06:12] <dabaR> syntaxx: not sure where to remove it, I looked at all the files that are installed by the gnome-session package.
[06:12] <InkChild> FlyCaster: yep
[06:12] <cmweb> Yes ive lost the documentation not such a good thing i found out
[06:12] <FlyCaster> ok
[06:12] <InkChild> FlyCaster: with sudo
[06:13] <slicky> Jordan_U:  still the same.. OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
[06:13] <InkChild> FlyCaster: now i got something to do, sorry
[06:13] <philip> is there a way to resize top panel tray icons?
[06:13] <FlyCaster> inkchild:  thanks!
[06:13] <e319> hi, i got a bunch of errors with i/o stream when iam trying to install ubuntu, most other os's say "boot disk failure" only fc6 installs, wnt to run ubuntu though, ithink that the kernel is the issue, with supporting my sata mobo connections
[06:13] <slicky> Jordan_U: it should be> OpenGL renderer string: RADEON 9600 Generi    or something
[06:13] <Jordan_U> slicky: that is truly bizarre, can you post the new xorg.conf ?
[06:14] <slicky> Jordan_U:  sure
[06:14] <InkChild> FlyCaster: sorry
[06:14] <e319> are there any ubuntu or kubuntu iso's with the newest kernel?
[06:14] <|thunder> what is the linux equix. of dreamweaver
[06:14] <cmweb> Help, i almost out of space. I have created another portion on the other hard drive an i nuno how to access it
[06:15] <|thunder> e319, edgy is 2.6.17-10-generic
[06:15] <e319> i am looking for 2.6.18 ... hmm
[06:16] <e319> all that iget when i boot is the splash, some msg's, then the same 2 errors repeating ...
[06:16] <slicky> Jordan_U:  http://83.249.37.33/xorg.conf.1
[06:16] <synacktion> anyone know the location of the XFCE menu file?
[06:16] <dabaR> cmweb: run sudo fdisk -l and post output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:16] <|thunder> e319; try fiesty
[06:16] <KnowledgEngi> sudo apt-get install linux-source
[06:16] <wpc> can anyone help me get inline vidoes to work in firefox such as a .mov
[06:17] <Jordan_U> slicky: Did you press ctrl+alt+backspace?
[06:17] <KnowledgEngi> this is the same source of default ubuntu edgy kernel ??
[06:17] <slicky> Jordan_U:  yes
[06:17] <Jordan_U> slicky: and did it log you out when you did that?
[06:17] <cmweb> dabaR, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33401/
[06:18] <stevr1it> every time i want to work in internet with ubuntu 6.10 gnome, when i start it i have to configurate the internal network with digiting  ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.34 and to digit in the terminal route add default gw 192.168.1.1
[06:18] <stevr1it>  (the ip of th erouter). How can i make it working automatically?
[06:18] <slicky> Jordan_U: yepp.. but i think i have to reboot
[06:18] <bimberi> KnowledgEngi: yes
[06:18] <Jordan_U> slicky: It shouldn't make a difference but if you want to it can't hurt.
[06:18] <dabaR> cmweb: look at it, and tell me what you think the partition you want to mount is, and how sure of it you are.
[06:18] <Jordan_U> slicky: Wait .
[06:19] <Jordan_U> slicky: sudo modprobe fglrx
[06:19] <KnowledgEngi> and the .config is the same used by edgy ???
[06:19] <kodat> wpc, http://www.getautomatix.com/   -  download this, you can download most all the codecs you need...MPG files and some other media players suck at firefox in linux, at least i cant get them to work
[06:19] <slicky> Jordan_U:  but shouldnt i add  fglrx to the Section "Module"
[06:19] <KnowledgEngi> or edgy has as different configuration?
[06:19] <e319> where can i dl fiesty?
[06:19] <KnowledgEngi> as=a
[06:19] <cmweb> dabaR, /dev/hda3 its in the right place and exactly the rigth size
[06:19] <slicky> Jordan_U:  my keyboard layout became english when i restarted x lol
[06:19] <bimberi> KnowledgEngi: /boot/config*
[06:20] <dabaR> stevr1it: look at the /etc/network/interfaces file, and use man interfaces as a reference, ask me for further help if you need it.
[06:20] <wpc> kodat, thanks, i'll try that out.  is there anything else i could do to get them to work?  my dad likes watching youtube vidoes and other vlogs and i just switched them to ubuntu and he isn't happy.  i'm very new to this.
[06:20] <Jordan_U> slicky: Yeh.. that's my fault, the command I gave reset everything X related, including keyboard settings
[06:21] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk
[06:21] <dabaR> cmweb: next, run gksudo gedit /etc/fstab, and post the contents to pastebin again
[06:21] <kaiki> *wpc* install flash and youtube should work
[06:21] <dabaR> e319: /j #ubuntu+1
[06:21] <KnowledgEngi> i think that if a copy the config: cp /boot/configxxxx /usr/src/linuxsourcexxx/.config
[06:21] <KnowledgEngi> i do not need tu run make oldconfig
[06:21] <VigoFusion> automatix is not supported by Ubuntu, and users are not suggested to use it. I think
[06:21] <KnowledgEngi> is correct??
[06:21] <slicky> Jordan_U:  iv been reading from this guide.. and the trubleshoting dosent help
[06:22] <cmweb> dabar, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33403/
[06:22] <Jordan_U> slicky: Again, I am not very good at manually editing the xorg.conf, you probably need to add it to "modules" but first just try modprobing it and restart x again.
[06:22] <kodat> wpc, you tube wont be a problem, some other sides may though..its really random
[06:22] <KnowledgEngi> "if a copy" = "if i copy"
[06:22] <bimberi> KnowledgEngi: that I'm not sure about but this page might ...
[06:22] <kodat> wpc, sites*
[06:22] <stevr1it> Dabar here i am. I am inside interface
[06:22] <wpc> kodat, will do, thanks for your help
[06:22] <slicky> Jordan_U:  sudo modprobe fglrx  ?
[06:22] <ktrauberman> any idea why i can't get edgy to connect to my school's wireless, which uses WEP?
[06:22] <bimberi> KnowledgEngi: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild

[06:23] <Jordan_U> slicky: Whell ther's your problem at least :)
[06:23] <cmweb> stevr1it, your on spam
[06:23] <stevr1it> no
[06:23] <stevr1it> sorry
[06:23] <Jordan_U> slicky: How did you install fglrx?
[06:23] <dabaR> cmweb: :) where do you want to mount the partition? under your home, or under /media?
[06:24] <slicky> Jordan_U:  by a howto.. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI  this 1
[06:24] <ktrauberman> does anyone have any idea how to connect edgy to a wireless network that automatically provides a WEP key?
[06:24] <dabaR> stevr1it: post that to the pastebin, and the commands you get it to work, the pastebin is at paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:24] <cmweb> dabar, doesnt matter as long as i can acess it
[06:25] <VigoFusion> Should I apt-get firestarter? or download and install?
[06:25] <kaiki> apt-get
[06:25] <dabaR> cmweb: well, make a decision now, cause we have to choose one. under /media, it appears in your places menu, under your home it is like a directory in your home folder.
[06:25] <bimberi> VigoFusion: apt-get!
[06:25] <VigoFusion> Thank you
[06:25] <cmweb> media
[06:25] <stevr1it> dabaR ttp://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33404/
[06:25] <dabaR> cmweb: sudo mkdir /media/hda3
[06:25] <stevr1it> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33404/
[06:25] <cmweb> k
[06:26] <cmweb> dabaR, when should that take effect. I dont see it under places
[06:26] <dabaR> cmweb: then add this line "/dev/hda3       /media/hda3               ext3    defaults,users 0       0" to your fstab file, then save and close the editor, run sudo mount -a, and tell me whether you can se the files with ls /media/hda3
[06:26] <Jordan_U> slicky: I have never seen that error before, try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-driver-fglrx
[06:26] <dabaR> cmweb: we have not mounted it yet
[06:27] <Jordan_U> slicky: see if there are any errors when you run that.
[06:27] <cmweb> dabar, to what file
[06:27] <slicky> Jordan_U:  hm . when i type: fglrxinfo   it says: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[06:27] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk
[06:27] <dabaR> cmweb: do you have the /etc/fstab file still open?
[06:27] <mom> Hey I need to add an XP install to this computer right now (running ubuntu but have to half crapy msword) an pitfalls i should beware?
[06:27] <DFM> I want to install Ubuntu 64bit on my system that already dual boots xp/kubuntu
[06:27] <cmweb> oh, one sec
[06:27] <dabaR> cmweb: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[06:27] <DFM> when I install will it add itself to grub?
[06:27] <slicky> Jordan_U:  no.. no errors
[06:27] <DFM> or will it rewrite grub and cause me to loose access to the 32bit version?
[06:27] <dabaR> mom: yes.
[06:28] <cmweb> HA
[06:28] <dabaR> !grub|mom
[06:28] <ubotu> mom: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:28] <Jordan_U> mom: You can run word with wine in linux, when you install windows it will clobber GRUB.
[06:28] <phillipc> a
[06:28] <cmweb> dabar, i added it under all of it
[06:28] <stevr1it> dabaR: any suggestion? ttp://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33404/
[06:28] <mom> how about Lilo?
[06:28] <Jordan_U> slicky: Try the modprobe again.
=== phillipc is now known as philc_
[06:28] <dabaR> You will have to recover grub with the first link in there. Oooh, lilo, not sure how to reinstall it, but it will get wiped too. google for recovering lilo after installing windows :-/
[06:29] <slicky> Jordan_U:  same as b4
[06:29] <dabaR> stevr1it: one sec, I will get to it.
[06:29] <dabaR> cmweb: I do not understand what you mean.
[06:29] <cmweb> heres a past bin of the fstab file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33406/
[06:30] <Jordan_U> slicky: fglrx should work, but lets see if you can get 3D accel without fglrx using the Free drivers.
[06:30] <teledyn> i'm in supermount hell
[06:30] <teledyn> can't seem to disable it via the sysctl
[06:30] <gotit> hi guys
[06:30] <teledyn> freakin' "features"...
[06:30] <slicky> Jordan_U:  hm kk
[06:31] <InkChild> So does anybody know how to merge/join avi files in ubuntu?
[06:31] <Jordan_U> slicky: run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh   When it asks you for a driver choose "ATI" this time.
[06:31] <mom> oh no i'm using grub
[06:31] <paradox34690> is there a way to tell if I have an X Windows System development package
[06:31] <cmweb> dabar, i just did sudo mount -a and nothing happened only the girgle or my hard drive
[06:31] <dabaR> cmweb: Oh, ya, that totally makes sense now what you said there...:) well, save, close, and run sudo mount -a, and tell me whether you see the files with ls /media/hda3
[06:31] <mom> i just was hoping not to do extra steps but good old winblows
[06:31] <mom> alright thanks for the pages guys!
[06:31] <gotit> i have repaired the mbr now its using grub, but i want to edit the grub boot loader how could i do that, dont have the access
[06:31] <kodat> what the hell why cant i get automatix bleeder..i have the stupid automatix repository >.<
[06:31] <dabaR> mom: welcome
[06:32] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk.. brb.. ill reboot this time
[06:32] <teledyn> or is this not a supermount problem?  how the hell does the ubuntu kernel try to automount CDs?
[06:32] <cmweb> dabar, their are files a lost+found is the only thing
[06:32] <Jordan_U> slicky: Again, shouldn't make a difference but OK.
[06:32] <feross> any fvwm users here? how can I run nm-applet when fvwm starts?
=== reyNoLd is now known as ReYnoLd_ubaYa
[06:32] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk.. just restarting x then
[06:32] <dabaR> cmweb: show me the command you ran and output on pastebin, please.
[06:33] <dabaR> stevr1it: you can add those two commands to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh, at the bottom, then restart the computer and tell me whether it works.
[06:33] <cmweb> dabaR,
[06:33] <cmweb> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33407/
[06:33] <dabaR> stevr1it: the two commands being the 2 commands you run to get it working.
[06:33] <stevr1it> ok
[06:33] <stevr1it> ok
[06:33] <ktrauberman> hey guys, Is there something that needs to be done to have edgy automagically pick up a WEP key from a wireless network like windows does?
[06:34] <slicky> Jordan_U:  hm.. now iv got a lower resolution
[06:34] <dabaR> cmweb: that means that we have successfully(not the correct spelling likely) mounted it and now it will mount every time you start the computer. Do you see it under your places menu?
[06:34] <nachtfalke> Question: how do i change my defualt soundcard
[06:34] <cmweb> dabaR, No
[06:34] <gotit> hi guys, i want to remove a "windows xp professional" line from boot loader , there are two of them
[06:34] <dabaR> ktrauberman: automatically pick up a wep key? I never heard of this.
[06:34] <ktrauberman> yeah
[06:34] <dabaR> cmweb: try killall gnome-panel.
[06:35] <ktrauberman> in windows, theres an option to automatically get the WEP key from the AP
[06:35] <cmweb> dabar, that dont look so hot
[06:35] <dabaR> gotit: do both work?
[06:35] <ktrauberman> rather than manually typeing it in
[06:35] <bimberi> nachtfalke: system -> preferences -> sound
[06:35] <dabaR> cmweb: it will restart the panel
[06:35] <nachtfalke> thanks bimberi
[06:35] <gotit> dabaR :nope only one works
[06:35] <bimberi> nachtfalke: yw :)
[06:35] <dabaR> gotit: which one, first or second?
[06:36] <gotit> dabaR :second
[06:36] <kodat> anyone have any problems installing bleeder?
[06:36] <Jordan_U> slicky: That makes sence if the reverse-engeneered drivers don't support as high a resolution, they probably don't support 3D accelleration but try anyway out of curiosity :)
[06:36] <cmweb> dabaR, still nothing
[06:36] <nachtfalke> it's always the simple things... and trying to google those things never works
[06:36] <dabaR> gotit: edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove the first windows XP entry, if in doubt which one it is, post the contents of the file to paste.ubuntu-nl.org and I will look at it too.
[06:36] <cmweb> it wont open in places->computer ether
[06:37] <dabaR> cmweb: try clicking to it in nautilus from / to media to hda3.
[06:37] <klees> how can i tell what the block size of a filesystem?
[06:37] <gotit> dabaR: I dont have the access to the enter the system , is there any other way
[06:37] <kodat> there we go got it
[06:37] <cmweb> Ok it open their
[06:37] <dabaR> gotit: what do you mean dont have access?
[06:37] <cmweb> dabar, i got it open their
[06:38] <klees> anyone?
[06:38] <cmweb> dabar, but i have no permissions
[06:38] <kaiki> *klees* have you tried df from the command prompt?
[06:38] <stevr1it> dabaR: i have tryed to open it with gedit in root but it does not open
[06:38] <dabaR> cmweb: really, it gives you trouble with that? weird. one sec, please, brb
[06:38] <slicky> Jordan_U:  it was better b4 :D
[06:38] <slicky> ;D*
[06:38] <klees> df tells u the block size?
[06:38] <nachtfalke> i there a general how to about getting ubuntu up to speed after install
[06:38] <nachtfalke> i keep runnign into one's that are out of date
[06:38] <Tomcat_`> nachtfalke: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade should do it.
[06:39] <dabaR> stevr1it: you tried gksudo gedit /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh?
[06:39] <kaiki> *klees* it lists the 1k blocks
[06:39] <nachtfalke> i mean like a walk through
[06:39] <gotit> dabar: actually its our office system , and to whom it belongs is on a holiday,
[06:39] <Jordan_U> slicky: I am going to ask the people at #ubuntu-xgl if they have any idea why the modprobe fails.
[06:39] <Tomcat_`> nachtfalke: I'm not sure what you mean then... when you install Ubuntu and update it afterwards, you're done.
[06:39] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk do so, how do i restore my drivers?
[06:39] <nachtfalke> i mean of like all the general software most people want
[06:40] <gotit> can i do it from booting with the cd
[06:40] <slicky> Jordan_U:  to the fglrx
[06:40] <stevr1it> DabaR: it says: GTK Accessibility Module initialized but does not open
[06:40] <nachtfalke> some webpage
[06:40] <dabaR> gotit: you need root permissions to edit that file. I can think of you rebooting the system, starting in recovery mode(or safe or single user, the term escapes me atm) and that gives you a root shell, but you would have to use a command line editor, nano is the simplest, they say.
[06:40] <dabaR> stevr1it: can you use vi, or try nano
[06:40] <stevr1it> ok
[06:40] <Jordan_U> slicky: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh And choose fglrx.
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> nachtfalke: tough to do that really, fire up 'synaptic' and browse and select what looks good to you
[06:41] <Jordan_U> slicky: If you want more options you can run that command without the "-phigh" switch.
[06:41] <gotit> dabaR: so what should i do than, i am not used to it
[06:41] <Kingsqueak> nachtfalke: people have such widely varying opinions on applications, just play around, you'll find what you like
[06:41] <slicky> Jordan_U:  kk .. dont thing i need more options right now
[06:41] <ixian_> nachtfalke, you could try automatix or easyubuntu, they can install a lot of common programs/utilities/etc
[06:42] <dabaR> gotit: leave it 'til the owner comes back.
[06:42] <cmweb> dabaR, dont forget about me here....
[06:42] <bimberi> nachtfalke: Ubuntu comes with a suite of 'general software' by default (email, web, office, IM, games ...)
[06:42] <Madpilot> ixian_, please don't recommend automatix here... giving advice that's known to break boxes is discouraged...
[06:42] <dabaR> cmweb: hehe, yup.
[06:42] <nachtfalke> thanks all
[06:42] <ixian_> i knew someone would say that
[06:43] <dabaR> cmweb: show me the output of ls -ld /media/hda3
[06:43] <Kingsqueak> well enough people show up here with automatix issues
[06:43] <atarinox> anyone know a good channel for web design?
[06:43] <gotit> dabaR: i need to do it , i have no other choice, i think i can if i boot from the cd and access the hard drive
[06:43] <cmweb> Dabar, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33412/
[06:43] <ixian_> ive been using it for months on dapper and edgy and no problems.. to each their own i guess
[06:43] <Madpilot> atarinox, #web, #css or #html
[06:43] <dabaR> gotit: that makes sense too. mount the drive, and edit it with sudo.
[06:43] <nachtfalke> alternative to auromatix?
[06:44] <ixian_> easyubuntu, but i dont think it works on edgy

[06:44] <dabaR> cmweb: we need to unmount the drive, so sudo umount /dev/hda3
[06:44] <cmweb> dabaR, ok unmounted
[06:44] <dabaR> cmweb: then we need to edit the file again, gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[06:45] <gotit> dabaR: mount? whats that is it like formating or partioning
[06:45] <cmweb> dabaR, ok im in edit

[06:45] <Calvin18> anyone experiencing problems with the intel pro/100 pcmcia network cards?
[06:46] <Calvin18> ubuntu loads e100 for it.. but i can't ping anyone else
[06:46] <dabaR> gotit: no, it is like telling your operating system how to use a partition of your hard disk
[06:46] <dabaR> cmweb: to start, I do not like the spacing on that last line, copy a line from above, and edit it to have the right values and spacing.
[06:47] <gotit> dabaR: so any experties required to mount the drive , i am lost here
[06:47] <kishan> hi
[06:47] <cmweb> ok i got it lined up
[06:47] <kishan> need some help with network manager
[06:47] <kaiki> hi
[06:47] <dabaR> gotit: are you gonna boot the live CD? If so, do that now, and come back
[06:47] <cmweb> dabaR, i got it all lined up
[06:47] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: how new are you?  meaning, did you see if the interface is up, did you run dhclient on it etc.
[06:47] <seth1248> What is the command to list partition's uuid?
[06:47] <dabaR> cmweb: make sure it is the same exact thing, spaces vs. tabs could make a difference.
[06:47] <Kingsqueak> seth1248: blkid /dev/whatever1
[06:48] <gotit> dabaR: ok
[06:48] <cmweb> dabaR, ok
[06:48] <seth1248> Kingsqueak: Thank You
[06:48] <cmweb> one min
[06:48] <kishan> well i have problem with network ..it is not recongnizing the wireless connection
[06:48] <nachtfalke> what do you all use for irc in ubuntu?
[06:48] <stuart> konversation
[06:48] <kaiki> *nachtfalke* xchat
[06:48] <kishan> problem is with the network manager
[06:48] <Kingsqueak> irssi
[06:49] <kishan> can any one help please
[06:49] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: well i think i can configure the network card thru shell..
[06:49] <stuart> can someone explain how to remove software not listed in synaptic (particularly jre)
[06:49] <kaiki> *kishan* What's the problem, kishan?
[06:49] <cmweb> dabaR, ok
[06:49] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: but the funny thing is that for some links it works...
[06:49] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: so if you do a manual   ifconfig   it works?
[06:49] <stuart> konversation seems nicer than xchat
[06:49] <noiesmo> stuart, thru terminal you can use apt-get remove packagename
[06:49] <dabaR> stuart: how did you install it?
[06:50] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: no.. i used ifconfig to do it manually
[06:50] <kishan> kaiki : i have installed the network manager but it is not recongnising the wireless network
[06:50] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: i believe it has something to do the link autodetection..
[06:50] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: you remembered to run 'ip route' or 'route' to add the default gateway too right?
[06:50] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: possible to set it as a insmod parameter?
[06:50] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: ah, hmm ethtool or mii-tool set it, not sure if you can force it on mod load
[06:50] <stuart> noiesmo and dabar - i followed Sun's installation instructions, except i type ./name of bin file while the file was sitting in my home directory
[06:51] <stuart> needles to say it does not work
[06:51] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: yes i've done that... but it can't even reach the gateway.. i think i am not planning to reach too far yet
[06:51] <stuart> needless
[06:51] <cmweb> dabaR, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33414/
[06:51] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: k, so the situation is that you are plugging and unplugging without a reboot or reset right?
[06:51] <gotit> dabaR: cant do it dont have the internet access there, its in the other building
[06:51] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: it could be getting confused on auto-neg, I've seen that happen with other nics
[06:51] <dabaR> cmweb: now save the file, close and run sudo mount -a again, then see whether the ls -ld /media/hda3 command still does the same thing.
[06:52] <Kingsqueak> Calvin18: the only thing I've done to get around that is to just reboot the box or bring the nic up and down a few times
[06:52] <Calvin18> Kingsqueak: i shud try and play around with the settings again
[06:52] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/MTGUMG60.html
[06:52] <cmweb> dabaR, you do relize that their is nothing in the other drive....
[06:52] <KnowledgEngi> is correct ?????
[06:52] <KnowledgEngi> this is the procedure that i do about rebuilding kernel adding a support in the configuration
[06:52] <dabaR> gotit: cmweb -ld will show permissions and owner for the partition/directory
[06:52] <bimberi> kishan: have you commented out all but the "lo" interface in /etc/network/interfaces
[06:52] <jimle> Can anyone tell be the command that runs the Xorg config thing?
[06:52] <dabaR> cmweb: that was for you above
[06:52] <cmweb> mount: special device /dev/hdb3 does not exist
[06:52] <bimberi> !xconfig
[06:52] <ubotu> To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[06:53] <jimle> bimberi, thank you
[06:53] <bimberi> jimle: np :)
[06:53] <noiesmo> stuart, you should just be able to delete the folder it installed in
[06:53] <dabaR> cmweb: where did  the hdb3 come from? we are working with hda3
[06:54] <stuart> thanks noiesmo i can handle that
[06:54] <cmweb> clint@clint-desktop:~$ sudo mount -a
[06:54] <cmweb> mount: special device /dev/hdb3 does not exist
[06:54] <gotit> dabaR: owner of the directory, you mean i cant browes even the directory, and edit the file
[06:54] <kishan> bimberi: i have my network reconized by edgy by default and i have no problem connecting with net the problem that i have is i am trying out network manager which does not recognize the wireless network
[06:54] <noiesmo> stuart, you can get java from multiverse repo or you can make your own deb with 5 easy steps
[06:55] <dabaR> gotit: the easiest thing, I think would be to boot into single user mode, recovery in the menu, and to run nano /boot/grub/menu.lst, edit the file to remove the not working windows entry, then save with ctrl-X, and reboot, if at any point you do not feel comfortable about it, then stop...
[06:55] <noiesmo> stuart, that way if you want to update it easier
[06:55] <cmweb> dabar. my bad
[06:55] <stuart> noisemo i could not see java in multiverse
[06:55] <cmweb> dabar, i got it going
[06:55] <dabaR> gotit: that post was not for you, actually, sorry, the one about the owner.
[06:55] <cmweb> dabarnow what
[06:55] <cmweb> dabar, No what
[06:55] <bimberi> kishan: yes, do  you mean that the network doesn't appear in the applet's list?
[06:55] <cmweb> i cant type
[06:55] <dabaR> cmweb: well, what part did you get going?
[06:55] <noiesmo> stuart, sun-java5-jre and sun-java5-plugin
[06:55] <kishan> bimberi: yes u got me right
[06:55] <cmweb> dabar, i messed the file up i fixed it now it didnt give the errpr

[06:56] <soulfire45> Hello
[06:56] <kaiki> hello
[06:56] <soulfire45> hey kaiki
[06:56] <soulfire45> is there a ubuntu-devel channel?
[06:56] <gotit> dabaR: "nano /boot/grub/menu.lst"=edit config.ini am i right??
[06:57] <seth1248> Every time an update updates the kernel it updates grub's menu.lst to point to /dev/hda3 for the kernel, but my kernel is on /dev/hda2; How can I make it set the correct partition so that I don't have to manually change menu.lst on every update?
[06:57] <stuart> noisemo - i enabled all the repositories that come "built in" to kubuntu - do i need to add another to get multiverse?
[06:57] <kishan> bimberi: what do u want me to do
[06:58] <[tasty] freeze> I used apt-get remove and then reinstalled a package later on, but it did not readd the init script... can someone help eme out
[06:58] <dabaR> gotit: not that good with windows any more...:-/ but it will edit the menu that you see at startup
=== lastnode__ is now known as lastnode
[06:58] <dabaR> cmweb: unmount, edit the file again.
[06:58] <noiesmo> stuart, you add universe and multiverse after repos and then do update if you doing it in graphic click apply and then update
[06:58] <bimberi> kishan: comment out (with a '#') anything except lines like 'auto lo' and 'iface lo...'
[06:59] <kishan> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33415/
[06:59] <noiesmo> stuart, like so deb http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe multiverse
[06:59] <kishan> this is the file
[06:59] <cmweb> dabar, how do i change the permissions on it. Im ok now i can get to it but how do i change permissions
[06:59] <dabaR> cmweb: that is what we are working on.
[06:59] <gotit> dabaR: wait i am tring it or other system with windows to see if i can mount..
[07:00] <noiesmo> stuart, also on backports I added it also
[07:00] <Spee_Der> soulfire45: ry ubuntu-devel
[07:00] <stuart> noiesmo is that the correct multiverse for kubuntu too?
[07:00] <FloK> i do apt.get install flashplugin-nonfree but cant confirm the license screen
[07:00] <dabaR> cmweb: so edit the file. the permissions are set at mount time.
[07:00] <bimberi> kishan: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager
[07:00] <cmweb> dabaR: can i do chown clint /media/hda3
[07:00] <soulfire45> yup
[07:00] <dabaR> cmweb: you can try anything you want, and let me know how it worked...
[07:00] <noiesmo> stuart, I'm running kde yes it is its aussie thou
[07:00] <FloK> paged to the end of the screen but not possible to enter "ok"
[07:00] <FloK> any idea?
[07:01] <cmweb> dabaR: you know something i dont. That will scre it up wont it?
[07:01] <KnowledgEngi> http://rafb.net/paste/results/MTGUMG60.html
[07:01] <noiesmo> stuart, k you can use same you aussie i see
[07:01] <KnowledgEngi> someone can tall me if this is correct ???
[07:01] <soulfire45> I am having trouble with installing the IA64 ISO
[07:01] <bimberi> kishan: in particulat the section headed "Configuring Devices"
[07:01] <stuart> noisemo - ive got all the repos enabled that come built in, (incl. backports), but still i can't see the jre packages you mentioned
[07:01] <dabaR> cmweb: no, it just won't work as far as I know. This is precision stuff, the operating system will not let you mess up too much of it.
[07:01] <soulfire45> the installer starts..but when it gets to loading from the cd it says that the cd is not a cd it can use..
[07:01] <KnowledgEngi> i just recompiling that kernel configuring a different cpu timer frequency
[07:02] <stuart> noisemo - yes im in sydney
[07:02] <dabaR> cmweb: well, that is not really true, but in this case it is pretty safe.
[07:02] <dabaR> cmweb: we need to edit the file, we are almost there...
[07:02] <noiesmo> stuart, ok one sec will post my sources.list and you can see
[07:02] <dabaR> cmweb: do yo uremember the unmount and edit commands?
[07:02] <stuart> thanks
[07:02] <cmweb> dabaR: commands commmands just give me commands
[07:03] <dabaR> cmweb: they are in your shell history, try the up arrow on the keyboard, it is very useful
[07:03] <Vaske_Car> Is there any application to change CLOCK look?
[07:03] <tim|iBook> How do I get sudo to edit the X11 conf file?

[07:03] <SurfnKid> how can i mount my ISO DVD files on a computer and make it look like a CD but in reality its a USB HDD
[07:03] <bimberi> !xconfig | tim|iBook
[07:03] <ubotu> tim|iBook: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[07:03] <dabaR> tim|iBook: 2 ways, gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, or sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:04] <SurfnKid> so that Synaptic can accept the source device as a CDROM and let me read from it
[07:04] <dabaR> tim|iBook: + numerous other editor ways
[07:04] <Lynoure> SurfnKid: mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/
[07:04] <Vaske_Car> dabaR, jel ima nesto da se promjene izgled casovnika u Gnome?
[07:04] <dabaR> !iso | SurfnKid
[07:04] <ubotu> SurfnKid: To mount an .iso image: sudo mount -o loop my.iso /some/mountpoint - bin/cue can be converted to iso with bchunk  .iso images of Ubuntu CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com Always verify the .iso before burning, see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
=== david is now known as davidoff
[07:04] <SurfnKid> yeah i can do that loop mount
[07:05] <dabaR> Vaske_Car: well, change it how?  right click on it and then properties
[07:05] <SurfnKid> but on Synaptic
[07:05] <SurfnKid> if I want to add a CDROM
[07:05] <SurfnKid> it wont let me look at any other source, except a device... typically a DVD/CDROM
[07:05] <Lynoure> SurfnKid: do it outside synaptic, then use it inside synaptic?
[07:05] <dabaR> SurfnKid: man apt-cdrom is best I can do for that
[07:05] <noiesmo> stuart, ok here's mine I'm on Kubuntu Edgy with Beryl KDE3.5.5 http://noiesmo.dnsalias.net/index.php?topic=Configuration
[07:05] <cmweb> dabaR: like i said its easyer by just giving the commands. I took me a month to memorize DOS commands
[07:05] <Vaske_Car> dabaR, it does not have fetarue to chage its look
[07:05] <SurfnKid> ah
[07:06] <dabaR> cmweb: well, sudo umount /dev/hda3;gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[07:06] <gop> !itunes
[07:06] <ubotu> itunes is not available on Linux, but there are many audio player alternatives (see !players). For Daap clients (sharing music with other iTunes clients on the network), install banshee
[07:06] <noiesmo> stuart, if your on dapper you change all edgy to dapper
[07:06] <dabaR> Vaske_Car: I really do not know how to change it. I use xclock
[07:06] <SurfnKid> Lynoure, well you add the CD source in Synaptic, but how can you add the actual /mnt/path instead
[07:06] <cmweb> dabaR, dont be hidin from me, what do i do in the file
[07:07] <byro> anyone have to use pppoe here?
[07:07] <stuart> thanks noisemo
[07:07] <Lynoure> SurfnKid: Sorry, it's been while since I was using synaptic.
[07:07] <dabaR> byro: yes
[07:07] <SurfnKid> Lynoure, np, what u use?
[07:07] <dabaR> cmweb: replace "users" with "rw" on that line, then save close the file, and sudo mount -a again, ls -ld /media/hda3 again, and post output again.
[07:08] <gop> I got one question what is the proper way of getting itunes installed or used on ubuntu
[07:08] <dabaR> cmweb: I hid cause I use xclock
[07:08] <gop> is thier any unoffical way
[07:08] <byro> dabaR: well pppoeconf works great for me, but i wish i didn't have to use pppoe at all. Is it because of my dsl modem/router itself? i wish it just made a network connection and retrieved settings from dhcp
[07:08] <Lynoure> SurfnKid: I'm mostly on Kubuntu, so I use Adept, and very often also the command line stuff (apt-get and aptitude)
[07:08] <dabaR> byro: does it work? it is not up to you, dsl uses pppoe, so get cable if you really find a reason to not like pppoe
[07:08] <darkmatter> gop, wine... but its not the perfect solution
[07:09] <SurfnKid> ah yes
[07:09] <noiesmo> stuart, feel free look round site no ads or anything just info you'll find other usefull tips :)
[07:09] <SurfnKid> im starting to like aptitude, forced to when X doesnt work and have to get network, apps going
[07:09] <cmweb> dabaR, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33417/
[07:09] <byro> dabaR: yes thanks. pppoeconf works great for me. I just would like to avoid using "pon dsl-provider" and "poff" but that's OK it's not a biggie ;) thanks
[07:09] <kaiki> bryo: if you have a modem or router that does the pppoe for you, your linux box should be able to be on dhcp or static
[07:09] <dabaR> byro: you have to do that every time you start the computer?
[07:10] <Viscid2> Hey. I just did a clean install of Edgy Eft. I had Dapper working fine. But when this one boots into gnome, everything freezes and becomes unresponsive and I have to hard reboot. Has anyone else had similar issues?
[07:10] <stuart> cool, thanks noisemo
[07:10] <dabaR> cmweb: hm, why won't it let us write to it...
[07:10] <kupesoft> what's the good multiplayer game for ubuntu
[07:10] <byro> yes but only because i am running ubuntu 6.06 live cd (i'm visiting my aunt's house while she's gone and i greatly prefer linux to windows)
[07:10] <Samus_Aran> hi.  I am using 6.10 and would like to try out SWAT, but going to http://localhost:901/ gives me nothing.  it is listed in inetd, and apt-get install swat is done
[07:10] <omkar86> is there any customised ubuntu install cd tht has development(programming) packages?
[07:11] <cmweb> !swat
[07:11] <ubotu> samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[07:11] <cmweb> oh
[07:11] <Samus_Aran> kupesoft: "the" good game ?  there are lots ..
[07:11] <Lynoure> kupesoft: I like A Tale in the Desert but it's not free
[07:11] <kupesoft> Sorry, what's the good multiplayer game for Debian
[07:11] <Samus_Aran> kupesoft: for some free ones, try out Savage and Enemy Territory
[07:11] <byro> kaiki: this is an old, old modem.. speedstream 5360
[07:11] <byro> i'd pay for my aunt to have a newer modem if i could get one to do the pppoe for me
[07:12] <Lynoure> kupesoft: My answer still stays
[07:12] <FloK> i had trouble with flashplugin-nonfree and now every apt-get install wants to reinstall it but the archive is missing
[07:12] <FloK> how can i remove that ?
[07:12] <Crell> Hi all.  Odd question.  I'm setting up an ubuntu-server Edgy mail server.  Why does the postfix package depend on, of all things, emacs?
[07:12] <dabaR> byro: well, ya, you have to run pppoeconf every time you boot the live cd, no help for that either that I know of. There are dsl routers that use dhcp on the lan side, look into a device like that, if you want to spend monies.
[07:12] <FloK> (so it wont be installed at all?)
[07:13] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: there is no text "swat" on either of those posted URLs
[07:13] <byro> dabaR: ok thanks
[07:13] <kaiki> bryo: you don't even need a very modern one, a $20 used bridge for dsl should have that capacity
[07:13] <Samus_Aran> FloK: dpkg -r flashplugin-nonfree
[07:13] <balder> hello
[07:13] <cmweb> Samus_aran, that was info for me. I had no clue wat Swat was
[07:13] <crimsun> Samus_Aran: needs to be -P
[07:13] <Samus_Aran> FloK: or apt-get -f install
[07:13] <dabaR> cmweb: I will be right back with the solution, I hope.
[07:13] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: oh, heh
[07:13] <cmweb> yep to both of ya
[07:14] <byro> kaiki: can i just go out and buy one? or do i have to have ATT sell me one (ugh!)?
[07:14] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: strange that the bot gives out a page with no mention of SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool)
[07:14] <slicky> how do i reload my modules?
[07:14] <Samus_Aran> I've never tried SWAT before and wanted to give it a go
[07:14] <cmweb> THATS what it is
[07:14] <dabaR> cmweb: hm...
[07:14] <cmweb> samba is the domain thing right?
[07:14] <dabaR> cmweb: samba is a windows share server
[07:15] <dabaR> cmweb: kinda sorta
[07:15] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: it is compatible with Windows Networking (file/printer shares, wins server, domain controllers)
[07:15] <cmweb> dam, i just read the thing DUH
[07:15] <FloK> dpkg: error processing flashplugin-nonfree (--remove):
[07:15] <FloK>  Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should
[07:15] <FloK>  reinstall it before attempting a removal.
[07:15] <FloK> Errors were encountered while processing:
[07:15] <stevr1it> gnome does not work properly,  at the start up says error daemon reply blocked. i am using ubuntu 6.10
[07:15] <FloK> @ Samus_Aran
[07:15] <cmweb> Flok, your verging
[07:16] <dabaR> cmweb: sudo umount /dev/hda3;sudo mount -text3 -orw /dev/hda3 /media/hda3;ls -ld /media/hda3, post output
[07:16] <cmweb> well crud, im going to be stuck with no space i got 1gb left
[07:16] <FloK> dont understand verging, cmweb , you mean pasting too much? sorry
[07:16] <dabaR> FloK: try sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
[07:16] <FloK> brb
[07:17] <balder> some body here can let me know,  how I can download the new Ubuntu release?
[07:17] <cmweb> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33419/
[07:17] <dabaR> !download | balder
[07:17] <ubotu> balder: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[07:17] <cmweb> balder, the upgrade icon
[07:17] <Samus_Aran> FloK: if that doesn't work, you can tell dpkg to forcibly remove it with something like: dpkg --force-all --purge flashplugin-nonfree
[07:18] <syntaxx> what happen to tvtime in edgy?
[07:18] <pilibeen> is there a flash animation program for ubuntu?
[07:18] <balder> thanks  guys
[07:18] <pilibeen> or similar vector-animation app
[07:18] <dabaR> cmweb: something is weird... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33420/
[07:18] <crimsun> dapper and edgy will probably both receive new backports of flashplugin-nonfree next week
[07:18] <Samus_Aran> when I upgraded to 6.10, it took three tries before it would install the Flash plugin
[07:18] <Samus_Aran> it just sat there happily not downloading it the other two times
[07:18] <stevr1it> gnome does not work properly,  at the start up after 5 minutes of  empty window it says error daemon reply blocked. i am using ubuntu 6.10. what can i do?
[07:19] <crimsun> I uploaded a flashplugin-nonfree to feisty that fixes nearly all of the known issues a couple hours ago
[07:19] <cmweb> dabaR, im already passworded in
[07:19] <Samus_Aran> stevr1it: I don't know much about Gnome, but I suggest asking in the official channel, as many of the Gnome developers are there
[07:19] <stevr1it> ok
[07:19] <Samus_Aran> stevr1it: irc://irc.gimp.org/#gnome
[07:19] <dabaR> Does anyone know why sudo mount -text3 -orw /dev/hda3 /media/hda3 would give drwxr-xr-x permissions, and on anotehr computer sudo mount -text3 -orw /dev/hda9 /media/hda9/ gives drwxrwxrwx permissions.
[07:20] <dabaR> cmweb: well, no not that... what is weird is that I get right permissions, and you get wrong permissions with the same command
[07:20] <stuart> noisemo, I already had http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ listed in repositories - but despite doing a search in synaptic for java (name and description) I can't see either of the 2 files u mentioned
[07:20] <Samus_Aran> dabaR: not sure why the defaults would be different, but just set the umask and it will be the same on both
[07:20] <cmweb> dabaR, maby ljl is right im not made out for linux
[07:20] <dabaR> ljl told you that?
[07:21] <cmweb> dabar, shes getting darn close to the mark....
[07:21] <dabaR> Samus_Aran: set the umask option? that is for ntfs only, though?
[07:21] <kaiki> anyone recommend a way to troubleshot a touchpad on a laptop to see if linux is messing up or if it's hardware?
[07:21] <cmweb> hes*
[07:21] <dabaR> ljl was joking, I am sure:))
[07:21] <Vaske_Car> does anybody use buici-clock?
[07:21] <Samus_Aran> dabaR: oops, I was thinking FAT32, not Ext3
[07:21] <gop> hmm this webiste is good
[07:21] <gop> http://www.frankscorner.org/index.php?p=itunes6
[07:21] <Samus_Aran> dabaR: (it works for any filesystem that doesn't have its own perms)
[07:21] <cmweb> dabaR, all i know is that this is SOOOO much easyer on windows
[07:22] <PurpleMonkey> how do we set the DNS setting so that it will not reset verytime the window goes to sleep?
[07:22] <gotit> dabaR: i think  i have to install ubuntu on some system and then try on it and do it there where the real prob resides :)
[07:22] <dabaR> gotit: maybe, I do not think so, though.
[07:22] <gotit> dabaR: really so what do you suggest than
[07:22] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: Windows is not actually much easier to use, it is just easier because of 1) you have been using Win32 for years, or 2) you can get help with Win32 issues much faster/easier as you have that "support network" already in your arsenal
[07:22] <dabaR> gotit: I told you.
[07:23] <derrick> join
[07:23] <derrick> help join
[07:23] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: if you had spent those years with GNU/Linux instead, you'd think Windows makes no sense =)
[07:23] <cmweb> Samus_aran, yeah over 6 years of it (im 15)
[07:23] <byro> Samus_Aran: good point
[07:23] <hanasaki> can someone help with oidentd or similar?  i have it installed and setup ~/.oidentd  but it still idents as my userid
[07:23] <joe74> I'm using Edgy, when I try to download a specific theme (saved not installed) it suddenly crashes, it means I can't save it to a local folder, anyone with this problem?
[07:24] <dabaR> gotit: the easiest thing, I think would be to go over to the computer, start in single user recovery mode, and sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove the entry, then save the file, and restart.
[07:24] <dabaR> gotit: guess I never finished that sentence...
[07:24] <gimmulf> Anyone who used afraid.org for DNS hosting? i dont understand howto make my server use the domain i put there
[07:24] <gotit> dabaR: boot from the cd in single user recovery mode and ...............
[07:24] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, how are you downloading the theme?  and where from?  You mean a Gnome theme, right?
[07:24] <cmweb> Oh well, i guess im not webhosting any time soon.....
[07:24] <joe74> Sorry Art Manager
[07:24] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: the people that pick up GNU/Linux the fastest are actually those that haven't used Windows all that long
[07:24] <gotit> dabar: :)
[07:24] <dabaR> cmweb: sudo umount /dev/hda3
[07:24] <joe74> I didn't specify that
[07:25] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, so, an Art Manager theme?  I'm not familiar with that program...
[07:25] <cmweb> dabar, im almost getting to where i know your next command
[07:25] <PurpleMonkey> any one can help me? How do i set the network so that the DNS number will not reset everytime the computer goes to sleep?? help please
[07:25] <dabaR> cmweb: sudo chmod 777 /media/hda3;sudo mount -text3 -orw /dev/hda3 /media/hda3
[07:25] <gotit> dabar: but you told me to mount the drive or some thing like that
[07:25] <jackrazz> anyone here using knoda with postgre from within ubuntu?
[07:25] <Samus_Aran> so does anyone happen to know how I can figure out why I can't get to the SWAT screen at http://localhost:901/ ?
[07:25] <dabaR> gotit: that is a different option.
[07:25] <dabaR> gotit: this one is least hassle in my opinion.
[07:25] <joe74> Art Manager is on the repos, comes with ubuntu
[07:26] <dabaR> gotit: YOu just boot in recovery mode, and edit the file, then restart
[07:26] <daaaman64> Alright I have a video encoded exactly how I want all my videos, however I do not know how it is encoded... In other words, I don't know what to tell mencoder.  Is there a way I can find out how the video is encoded?
[07:26] <cmweb> dabar, ok
[07:26] <dabaR> cmweb: done?
[07:26] <cmweb> dabar, yes
[07:26] <gotit> dabaR: ok i will try it right now i'll out for some time as the comp is not here :) thanks
[07:26] <dabaR> cmweb: show me output of ls -ld /media/hda3
[07:26] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, yea im not seeing it...    weird.   in any case, have you checked on ubuntuforums.org for someone with a similiar issue?
[07:27] <cmweb> dabar its still in root
[07:27] <dabaR> gotit: good luck
[07:27] <cmweb> drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-11-21 12:46 /media/hda3
[07:27] <joe74> <FunnyLookinHat> no, I already googled it abit...no one with same issue
[07:28] <joe74> all i want is change login manager to one I saw there
[07:28] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, hmm ok.  Let me try installing the program to see if I can duplicate the issue
[07:28] <stuart> noismo  I already had http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ listed in repositories - but despite doing a search in synaptic for java (name and description) I can't see either of the 2 files u mentioned
[07:28] <joe74> ok thx
[07:28] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, ooh, so this is something related to Gnome and not a program
[07:28] <stuart> noiesmo  I already had http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ listed in repositories - but despite doing a search in synaptic for java (name and description) I can't see either of the 2 files u mentioned
[07:28] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, you want to change the theme of a part of gnome
[07:28] <daaaman64> No one knows this?  I can move onto the forums.
[07:28] <noiesmo> stuart, did you have universe and multiverse after that and did you run update
[07:28] <joe74> yeah, like the login manager, or save themes to my folder, that's when it crashes
[07:28] <Samus_Aran> can someone please run the app 'qiv' (Quick Image Viewer) on Ubuntu 6.10 and tell me if it crashes ?  it worked fine on 6.06 but is crashing for me every time on 6.10
[07:29] <syntaxx> how can i install tvtime if its not the in the edgy repository?
[07:29] <cmweb> samus-aran THATS FUNNY
[07:29] <crimsun> !info tvtime
[07:29] <ubotu> tvtime: A high quality television application. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.1-2.2ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 636 kB, installed size 1768 kB
[07:29] <Samus_Aran> all I get is: Gdk-ERROR **: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)   serial 109 error_code 8 request_code 62 minor_code 0
[07:29] <crimsun> looks pretty existent to me, syntaxx
[07:29] <fyrestrtr> daaaman64: if you run the video through mplayer from the command line, it will tell you what codec and resolution the video has -- that should get you started.
[07:29] <syntaxx> crimsun: but when i apt-cache search tvtime it doesnt show
[07:29] <syntaxx> crimsun: and when i use synaptic it also doesnt show
[07:29] <crimsun> syntaxx: do you have universe enabled?
[07:29] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, What website are you getting the themes from?  Usually, you just drag the file with the theme onto the themes manager (found by going System - Preferences - Themes )
[07:30] <syntaxx> crimsun: how do i know? i just installed ubuntu
[07:30] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat it only crashes when I want to download to a folder, not when I install, but to change login manager I must first save it to local so I can install as sudo
[07:30] <Samus_Aran> it's quite annoying that "qiv", one of the tiniest, simplest image viewers ever, is now crashing.  I use it for my e-mail notification pop-ups, so I no longer see them ..
[07:30] <joe74> under synaptic look for gnome art
[07:30] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, give me the website of the file you are trying to download
[07:30] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: why exactly is a crashing app funny ?
[07:31] <dabaR> cmweb: try sudo chmod 777 /media/hda3; ls -ld /media/hda3 and post output
[07:31] <joe74> no there is no website, it automatically downloads the previews
[07:31] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, or are you trying to download it through gnome art?
[07:31] <joe74> so I don't know where they are at
[07:31] <cmweb> Samus_Aran, your trying to get some one else to do it
[07:31] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat yes, gnome art
[07:31] <crimsun> !components > syntaxx
[07:31] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, ahh ok, one sec
[07:31] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat Art Manager=Gnome Art :) lol
[07:32] <stuart> noisemo, I already had that address listed and have clicked "reload" - am i missing something?
[07:32] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat thx
[07:32] <cmweb> dabar, drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 2006-11-21 12:46 /media/hda3  <<< that turned green
[07:32] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, haha yea I found it now.  It's installing.
[07:32] <daaaman64> thank you fyrestrtr, seem to be seeing what I need. Also avidmux is great for converting videos heh.  Just not in bulk.
[07:32] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat ok
[07:32] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, you know, just an FYI, you can usually find good themes by googling gnome themes and then you download .tar.gz files and you just drag them onto the themes window from System - Preferences - Themes
[07:32] <dabaR> cmweb: weird. well, damn, that fixed the issue actually. run sudo chown -R /media/hda3
[07:33] <dabaR> sorry
[07:33] <cmweb> dabar, your missing a variable
[07:33] <Samus_Aran> cmweb: a crashing app on GNU/Linux isn't going to cause the kernel to crash or something, like it often does on Win32.  I just want to see if this is a universal 6.10 problem, or specific to my install
[07:33] <cmweb> dabar, what user
[07:33] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat ok, thx for the tip, didn't know that, I've always been a KDE user
[07:33] <dabaR> cmweb: sudo chown -R clint:clint /media/hda3
[07:33] <stuart> noiesmo - main restricted universe multiverse are listed in my repositories list (both deb and deb-src)
[07:33] <fyrestrtr> Samus_Aran: fwiw, I just installed it and got the same error. Check LP to see if its a reported issue, if not, report it.
[07:33] <friedtofu> ok -.- how do i change my resolution to 1440x900 ... i've been trying for 5-6 hrs now - intel 82915G/GV/910GL - i used the 915resolution hack - it doesnt load the 1440x900 - and when it does (cuz i set it as the only option) my monitor doesnt show it (it works perfectly under windows)
[07:33] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: thanks
[07:34] <cmweb> ok
[07:34] <pilibeen> is there a quick command to kill opera when it hangs?
[07:34] <cmweb> dabar, i have writing now
[07:34] <dabaR> cmweb: I can't believe that works actually, I wasted some of your time..but it works the other way here :~/
[07:34] <noiesmo> stuart, ok open a terminal and do this please
[07:34] <cmweb> YAYAYAYA
[07:34] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: doing an strace on it shows it trying to open up icon files that don't exist, presumably because they were moved (the moving of the Xorg dirs)
[07:34] <pilibeen> ...i can't do a search for it...since my browser is froze
[07:34] <fyrestrtr> Samus_Aran: if you know where its trying to locate them from, a symlink might be a quick fix.
[07:34] <stuart> noisemo, ok
[07:34] <dabaR> cmweb: you will likely haev to chown it every time you boot
[07:34] <morten_> my harddrive seems to have made a small boo-boo, and the file libapt-pkg-libc6.4-6.so.3.51 is gone. obviously, this means no apt tools function. what file do i need to manually download and dpkg -i?
[07:34] <noiesmo> stuart, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-cache search java
[07:34] <cmweb> dabar, my system likes my way of doing things :-D:-D
[07:35] <fyrestrtr> pilibeen: from a terminal, sudo killall opera
[07:35] <syntaxx> crimsun: ok so i will add new repositories for edgy? i only have ubuntu 6.06 dapper universe
[07:35] <kaiki> Is this the right channel to ask what a specific message in a log file means?
[07:35] <cmweb> dabar, Thanks my man
[07:35] <fyrestrtr> noiesmo: you don't need sudo for apt-cache
[07:35] <dabaR> cmweb: welcome
[07:35] <pilibeen> thanks
[07:35] <noiesmo> fyrestrtr, yeah i know just habit
[07:35] <daaaman64> fyrestrtr, I am going to see if it worked, it is so I can play it in my Wii :).
[07:35] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, well unfortunately - it seems like it's a problem with the program ...  so we can't get a fix for art-manager/gnome-art    ....   but, you can go ahead and install themes the way most other gnome users do...  I suggest using http://gnomelook.org/
[07:35] <friedtofu> hm, where does it show a list of all the users in Xchat?
[07:35] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: I used "locate" .. it's looking for /usr/share/icons/gnome/index.theme in various default places that no longer exist (e.g. /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icons).  I will try a symlink for the two files
[07:35] <fyrestrtr> kaiki: depends on the program that's generating the log :) ask and ye shall find.
[07:36] <crimsun> !info tvtime dapper
[07:36] <ubotu> tvtime: A high quality television application. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.1-2ubuntu2 (dapper), package size 627 kB, installed size 1744 kB
[07:36] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: hm, actually, it seems to find that file ... right before it crashes.
[07:36] <noiesmo> stuart, is it showing hits to universe and multiverse repos
[07:36] <crimsun> syntaxx: it's also in dapper/universe
[07:36] <Roscar> Hi all, Dirty newb here hoping to get help installing a piece of software.
[07:36] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat ok, so it does crash when attempting to save locally, thx I thought something missconfigured here
[07:36] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: and then it continues to look for it in other places.  apparently it's confused =p
[07:36] <kaiki> In Xorg.0.log it has ProcXCloseDevice to close or not ? Trying to find out if that is a bad thing, or just noise
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> Samus_Aran: we all are at some point :P
[07:37] <noiesmo> stuart, Hit http://au.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/universe Packages & Hit http://au.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/multiverse Packages for example
[07:37] <Roscar> I'm trying to install stepmania (stepmania.com). Can anybody help me out?
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> kaiki: what level message is it? (WW) (EE) or what?
[07:37] <dabaR> I found a bug in oo.o where it crashes when I paste something from it to gmail in epiphany
[07:37] <FunnyLookinHat> joe74, nah...   just a buggy program...  I don't think it was meant to be used really for ubuntu, looks more like it was just included because it was synched over from debian
[07:37] <syntaxx> crimsun: i have it but i cant find tvtime in it
[07:37] <fyrestrtr> dabaR: its likely a bug in epiphany.
[07:37] <joe74> FunnyLookinHat, well thx for your help and tips, I'll go and google some themes then...take care and good luck
[07:38] <dabaR> fyrestrtr: oo.o crashes...
[07:38] <Samus_Aran> fyrestrtr: it seems it is the mouse cursor icon it can't find anywhere (it looks in over 50 places for it).  will symlink that one.

[07:50] <FunnyLookinHat> stelt, you could try a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in console, that should fix X coming up to start
[07:51] <noiesmo> stelt, ubuntu use gnome for gui if live cd runs then it should bring up gui otherwise check /var/log/Xorg.).log

[07:52] <cherubiel> balder: oops, give a space after gedit
[07:52] <cherubiel> my bad.
[07:52] <noiesmo> stuart, once you adjust you'll need to sudo apt-get update again
[07:53] <balder> ok let me try
[07:53] <stelt> FunnyLookinHat, isn't resetting to default? As this is the liveCD failing on bringing up a GUI, that already is the default
[07:53] <stuart> noisemo, http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ -- wasn't that already there?
[07:53] <stelt> isn't --> isn't that
[07:53] <noiesmo> stuart, i just adjusted yours to have things in te right place yu didn't have universe and multiverse on the right lines
[07:53] <stuart> noisemo, i didn't manually type in the url's - just checked whether i wanted non-supported stuff via synaptic GUI
[07:54] <stuart> noisemo, ok, well thank you for helping me out :)
[07:55] <stuart> noisemo, i'm just annoyed that the gui didnt get it right in the first place -- thanks again

[08:08] <RoC_MM> kishan, I remember seeing stuff around for it....part of the distro already, or that may have been kubuntu-desktop...can't say anything more than that personally
[08:10] <kishan> thank you RoC_MM
[08:10] <RoC_MM> did you example the config sections of your distro?
[08:10] <RoC_MM> the control panel like applets
[08:10] <kishan> noooo
[08:10] <RoC_MM> are you running tht distro?
[08:11] <kishan> yes
[08:11] <kishan> no no
[08:11] <RoC_MM> but you didn't look in like that third menu on the top of the screen?
[08:11] <kishan> i am running ubuntu edgy
[08:11] <kishan> i am not a linux guy new to this but wanted to learn
[08:12] <kishan> so u mean i need to install kubuntu
[08:12] <gotit> dabar: its taking too much time to boot from the cd
[08:13] <RoC_MM> kishan, no, but you can test out Kubuntu (Ubuntu with the KDE desktop) because both the ubuntu and the kubuntu CD"s are livecds...so you should be able to poke around and you won't have to HD-install just to see.
[08:13] <kishan> ooh ok got it RoC_MM i will  try it out
[08:13] <noodles12> i'm new to kismet, But if when i press C shoudn't i see a list of clients of the ap that i highlighted? I am currently on mine and i don't see mine mac address pop up?
[08:13] <RoC_MM> Additionally, installing the package "kubuntu-desktop" will install everything that makes the Kubuntu KDE desktop up as far as I know, and then you can select "KDE" from your Session Type on the login screen, or something like that.
[08:13] <gotit> dabaR: there were 4-5 options i selected the "install or start .." and now 20 mins are already passed
[08:14] <kishan> but i hear tthat everything need to be tweek to use dual monitor but i donnot want to do it as it might make the xorg unstable
[08:14] <PurpleMonkey> i am new to Linus and just installUbuntu edgy from the livecds, Funny things is everytime the computer go to sleep, the DNS i key in will reset, cause me unable to go into the internet. Anyone can help me in this issue??
[08:15] <kishan> u need to confirgure it PurpleMonkey
[08:15] <RoC_MM> kishan, I'm not sure where you heard that from or if it's true, but I can't say anything further because I just don't know or use dual-head.
[08:16] <gotit> dabaR is not present i think
[08:16] <PurpleMonkey> kishan: i configurate it via the network setting by key in the DNS number..but..it still happen. Any other setting i must do?
[08:17] <gotit> oh its started ubuntu file browser is here i dont know what to do now its still loading , i'll be intouch

[08:20] <gotit> can any one plz help me installing ubuntu , i bought the cd just now
[08:20] <kishan> cool gotit itself expantory first check wheather it is compatable with your hard ware booting it as live cd

[08:22] <kishan> hmm that should not be happening gotit
[08:22] <kishan> restart the system
[08:22] <kishan> sorry gotit
[08:22] <kishan> did u say u are able to boot
[08:22] <gotit> no its slow i think its P1 with 128 ram
[08:23] <gotit> i can browse throug
[08:23] <gotit> its not hung
[08:23] <kishan> oooh that is the problem u need to dowload a package called alternative cd to install the ubuntu
[08:23] <PurpleMonkey> if we reinstall the linux with other distro...will it over write/delete the existing Ubuntu partition??
[08:24] <kishan> PurpleMokey generally it depends on destro if u can manually arrage partion then u can install without erasing the ubuntu
[08:24] <gotit> really i am on dialup , but the cd says it can be  installed

[08:25] <kishan> it can be gotit but 128 is not recomended only 256 is recommede to install
[08:25] <luke_> however, I can't seem to boot...  it says "raid not clean" and then somethning like /dev/hd1 not found
[08:25] <kishan> i suggest gotit to install xbuntu which will work well on it
[08:25] <ubuntu> !raid | luke_
[08:25] <ubotu> luke_: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[08:25] <luke_> :ubotu thanks
[08:26] <gotit> i just want to try on it and then install on the real sys
[08:26] <PurpleMonkey> kishan: thanks. mmmm i wonder...haha still got alot to learn...
[08:26] <kishan> PurpleMonkey i am learing tooo
[08:27] <kishan> well gotit as i said u cannot install on 128 mb with the live cd u need alternative cd to install it but still give a try
[08:28] <kishan> just click install on the icon on the desktop and follow the instructions
[08:28] <gotit> ok
[08:28] <kishan> but evern the live cd hungs when u try to install on 128 mb thats why i suggest u to try XBUNTU which works well on these old systems
[08:29] <zcat[1] > gotit: ubuntu live cd will seriously suck on 128M ram. A hdd install will be faster, but still pretty sluggish. You really need more ram.
[08:29] <ubuntu> kishan: Will xubuntu install from the LiveCD with 128 meg RAM ?
[08:30] <zcat[1] > Yep, xubuntu will be sweet..
[08:30] <kishan> use alternative cd to install that cool way of installing
[08:30] <gotit> it realy does suck : -)\
[08:30] <luke_> :ubotu hey man that link you sent me seems to be for hardware controllers
[08:30] <zcat[1] > not sure if you can get xubuntu through shipit.. fairly sure you can't..
[08:31] <gotit> right u r
[08:31] <ubuntu> kishan: luke_ Ubotu is a bot :)
[08:31] <kishan> xubuntu there is no ship it only dowload it
[08:31] <kishan> ubuntu i have no idea
[08:31] <luke_> oh... rofl.   <-  irc newb
[08:31] <pepeamid> O.o
[08:31] <gotit> how much meg it is ..
[08:31] <zcat[1] > !botsnack | luke_
[08:31] <ubotu> luke_: Yum!
[08:31] <ubuntu> kishan: They don't send alternate CD's for anything but the server install anyways.
[08:32] <kishan> ubuntu: ur right u need to dowload those
[08:32] <feroxide> anyone know why "enable mouse keys" stops functioning after a
[08:32] <feroxide>            period of time(10-15min) and needs to be turned off/on to start
[08:32] <luke_> is everything with a yellow tag a bot?
[08:33] <lastnode> kishan, are you sri lankan by any chance? :-)
[08:33] <gotit> from where i can download it
[08:33] <lastnode> luke_, what yellow tag?
[08:33] <spunconfuse> I get this error "Unable to mount the floppy drive. The floppy is probably in a format that cannot be mounted." when I plug in my memory card reader and try acessing it.  Anyone know what I can do to fix this?
[08:33] <duck_> I just came by here to see if anyone here would recommend a wirless access-point / router?
[08:33] <luke_> lastnode:  you have one too, so I guess not :)
[08:33] <duck_> I want one that connects to a usb printer and hopefully uses jetdirect interface
[08:33] <zcat[1] > gotit: from internet cafe, otherwise it will take about three days at best on dialup :)\
[08:33] <ubuntu> luke_: On this channel only ubotu and ubugtu are bots.
[08:33] <kishan> lastnode: ur near i am indian
[08:33] <kishan> why u ask
[08:33] <lastnode> duck_, edimax makes good stuff
[08:34] <lastnode> kishan, im sri lankan, that's why :-) nvm

[08:34] <kishan> question to all do we need a fire wall in linux
[08:35] <harm_kabisa> hi all, i have a serious problem with my perl installation, and I could really use some help...
[08:35] <rickyfingers> duck_: I'm using one now.  There are firmware versions out there that turn the wrt54g into a little linux box
[08:35] <lastnode> kishan, depends. firestarter is a good GUI firewall
[08:35] <lastnode> harm_kabisa, unless you ask, we cant help
[08:35] <harm_kabisa> i'm running edgy server
[08:35] <rickyfingers> duck_: and you can even do things like boost signal strength to get more range
[08:36] <harm_kabisa> I'm trying to install ispconfig
[08:36] <ubuntu> rickyfingers: Be VERRY carefull with that though, setting the signal strength to high could literally melt it.
[08:36] <kishan> Lastnode: how to clean files i mean junk files in ubuntu
[08:36] <luke_> I think I might have figured it out.  Perhaps I have to reconfigure grub to say /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda1?
[08:36] <harm_kabisa> And I get this when i run: perl -MCPAN -e shell:
[08:36] <harm_kabisa> Scalar found where operator expected at /usr/share/perl/5.8/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm line 953, near "return "$v"
[08:36] <harm_kabisa> lastnode, I'm sorry, I tried to explain above
[08:36] <lastnode> harm_kabisa, seems like a bad pm. try #perl
[08:36] <zcat[1] > ubuntu doesn't really need a firewall, but firestarter is really nice for setting up forwarding, NAT, DHCP and watching network traffic.
[08:37] <rickyfingers> ubuntu: I totally agree.  I worry if all the 2.4 GHz in my room is going to do something to me.
[08:37] <harm_kabisa> ok, will do
[08:37] <duck_> rickyfingers: iloveit.... :) :) Im so excited
[08:37] <duck_> rickyfingers: hopefully it doesn't look big and ugly
[08:38] <duck_> rickyfingers: not that I care too much
[08:38] <Lattyware> I have a hardware firewall anyway, personally. I still use firestarter for what zcat[1]  said.
[08:38] <rickyfingers> duck_: the wrt54g is about the size of a cigar box, and it has two antennas on either side on the back
[08:38] <ubuntu> duck_: images.google.com :)
[08:39] <luke_> anybody around that's set up a software raid before?  I'm following the how-to's to the t and they don't work.  I have a really simple setup so it shouldn't be difficult
[08:39] <gotit> what should i do guys should i add some ram to it cause i cant wait to download alternate cd
[08:39] <kishan> if u have ram gotit add it please
[08:39] <gotit> how much you suggest i put more
[08:39] <duck_> rickyfingers: i see it on newegg. did you get the blue/black or silver?
[08:39] <gotit> yeah sure i can pull some ram lol
[08:39] <kishan> 512 is really good gotit
[08:40] <PurpleMonkey> goit: there is never be enough in term of RAM
[08:40] <gotit> ok
[08:40] <ubuntu> gotit: You may be able to put a swap file on a pen drive or something so you don't run out of memory
[08:40] <cntb> \o
[08:40] <zcat[1] > 256M would be the minimum .. 512 or more is better
[08:41] <gotit> cause it really is slow nothing is going on and its not even hung :)
[08:41] <gotit> leme try adding some ram
[08:41] <ubuntu> gotit: I believe the Ubuntu LiveCD automatically detects any swap partitions so all you would have to do would be to partition a pen drive as swap in gparted.
[08:41] <zcat[1] > I only have about 400 in this machine.. not great, but tolerable.
[08:41] <cntb> tuxracer game is rather slow on default install. can the "nice" (priority setting) command help improve somewhat the not so satisfying experience?
[08:41] <gotit> wat is that pen drive  in gparted
[08:41] <gotit> i dont understand
[08:41] <zcat[1] > cntb: 3d drivers will help, if you don't already have them

[08:42] <ubuntu> cntb: Do you have 3D drivers installed?
[08:42] <Lattyware> Guess what, Far Left is actually 5.0, Middle 5.5, Right 60.

[08:43] <ubuntu> cntb: What kind of card do you have?
[08:43] <cntb> it is an nvidia
[08:43] <peanutb> luke_, i've used lvm groups
[08:43] <zcat[1] > or text/xml+html, MSIE makes a total mess of it...
[08:43] <cntb> on PIII
[08:43] <ubuntu> !nvidia | cntb
[08:43] <ubotu> cntb: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:43] <cntb> ok ty ubuntu
[08:43] <ubuntu> cntb: That will make everything run MUCH faster.
[08:44] <luke_> peanutb:  not sure what an lvm group is.  I'm trying to do this:  http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html#1
[08:44] <Lattyware> zcat[1] : lol, yeah. I can't wait until IE7 is in main use. As much as I hate IE, at least IE7 can render a hell of alot better than IE6
[08:44] <kishan> ubuntu do u have driver for intel cards too
[08:44] <luke_> peanutb:  it installs fine and such, but hangs on booting
[08:44] <Lattyware> That isn't really saying much though.
[08:44] <peanutb> luke_, its during os install.
[08:44] <cntb> how do I tell I am on default driver ubuntu ? i.e. not accelerated?
[08:44] <duck_> ubuntu: wrt54gl does not have a usb-printer port...
[08:45] <cntb> many q.s will wait patiently
[08:45] <gotit> aah the sys doesnt support more than two slots  i can add just 128 more
[08:45] <ubuntu> cntb: If you didn't install them you don't have them, you can use: glx | grep driver To check though.
[08:45] <kishan> cool all the best gotit
[08:45] <luke_> peanutb:  that thing where you have to set the md0-2?
[08:45] <cntb> perfect ty ubuntu
[08:46] <catalytic> whats the best compositing package on ubuntu?
[08:46] <kishan> ubuntu : do we need to install driver for intel video card
[08:46] <gotit> its 256 now guys :)
[08:46] <catalytic> i just read about cinelerra
[08:46] <catalytic> is there better?
[08:46] <peanutb> luke_, sorry im not following.
[08:47] <gotit> what should i select start or install i guess
[08:47] <kishan> start gotit
[08:47] <gotit> yeah its better
[08:47] <luke_> peanutb:  scan this link http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html#1
[08:47] <luke_> peanutb:  that's what I'm up too.  Something isn't working though.
[08:48] <ubuntu> kishan: No, intel cards just work because intel releases their drivers open source.
[08:48] <Pavi> whats gotit
[08:48] <cntb>  clicking links here on xchat brings konqueror. I would like firefox to show links by default instead.HOw
[08:48] <gotit> lol

[08:52] <nanomike> What log to see who shutdown the computer at some point?
[08:52] <ubuntu> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Install chinese language support ?
[08:52] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> how would i do that with apt-get
[08:52] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ?
[08:52] <gotit> yeah iam installing it i double clicked the install icon and install window is there i selected eng and lets see wats next
[08:54] <gotit> starting up the partitioner scanning disks
[08:54] <Shadow_mil> how do I install a rpm package?
[08:55] <ubuntu> !alean | Shadow_mil
[08:55] <Pavi> rpm -Uvh package.rpm
[08:55] <kishan> use alien applicatin shadow
[08:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alean - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:55] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> you could format it with alienx
[08:55] <gotit> i think i should select manually edit partition table , there are three unformated partions on my drive
[08:55] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> (to a .deb package)
[08:55] <ubuntu> !alien | Shadow_mil
[08:55] <ubotu> Shadow_mil: rpm is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous).
[08:55] <gotit> installing ubuntu pavi :-)
[08:55] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> lol

[08:57] <Pavi> so whats the problem gotit
[08:57] <Janchi> gotit: would you like to keep the Windows
[08:57] <Pavi> start ubuntu desktop cd
[08:57] <ubuntu> nanomike: It would have to be a gnome / kde log because AFIK the only user that can restart is root
[08:57] <gotit> yeah
[08:57] <Shadow_mil> When I use alien it creates a folder for that package
[08:58] <Pavi> if u want to keep windows edit partition manually
[08:58] <Janchi> gotit: no problem, you can install Ubuntu next to Windows
[08:58] <ubuntu> Shadow_mil: What are you trying to install?
[08:58] <Shadow_mil> VMserver
[08:58] <gen> my usb mouse & keybord often become disfunctional, I have to re-plug them to make them work, does anybody know the reason?
[08:58] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> Shadow_mil, why don't you try to compile the source?
[08:58] <Shadow_mil> Hinata_sama|iBoo: its not OSS
[08:58] <Shadow_mil> I know...
[08:58] <balder> one more question   how I can change properties of the  some folder  example  I try to paste one folder in a  MMC card but the sistem tould me you don`t have permit to write or soemthing like that
[08:58] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ah
[08:58] <dm_> isnt there a program out that that will find what you need for a make or a ./configure and install it for you?
[08:58] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: installing from source is much easier
[08:59] <Shadow_mil> VMware Server
[08:59] <Pavi> gotit u know what to do
[08:59] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: installing from source is easier
[08:59] <Shadow_mil> Janchi: ITS NOT FUCKING OSS
[08:59] <gotit> i guess i can there are four options here resize ide master partition 2,erase entire disk(sure not to select this one) 3 use the largest continuous free space 4 manually edit partition
[08:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> dm_, or... you could type ./configure
[08:59] <ubuntu> dm_: sudo apt-get build-dep packagename
[08:59] <nanomike> ubuntu, Yes. But i have users under /etc/sudoers that are allowed to restart the server. so thay used sudo shutdown -r or something. But where do i check when and who?
[08:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> or ./con(press tab here)
[08:59] <Pavi> manual dude
[08:59] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: I use Vmserver under Ubuntu, the source installer is way easier, I assure you
[08:59] <Pavi> go for manual partition
[09:00] <Pavi> manually edit partition
[09:00] <enyc> gotit: I think you could BACKUP important data, delete the 'd' 'e' 'f' partitions entirely ttos tart with, show win32 is still working, and then install ubuntu edgy and it should use the free space unless you tell it to erase entire disk
[09:00] <dm_> ubuntu its from a CVS or w/e
[09:00] <Shadow_mil> Janchi: ok you point me to VMware server's source and Ill install it
[09:00] <gotit> oh i missed that
[09:00] <balder> one more question   how I can change properties of the  some folder  example  I try to paste one folder in a  MMC card but the system tould me you don`t have permit to write or soemthing like that
[09:00] <dm_> Hinata_sama|iBoo i did that but its telling me i am missing stuff which i cant find in my repos
[09:00] <Pavi> install ubuntu in last partition ( recommended )
[09:00] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: it is on the vmware server download page. Just install the tar.gz package. One sec, I'll look up the complete name
[09:00] <Pavi> so u have to loose data on last drive
[09:01] <dm_> Hinata_sama|iBoo Package requirements (gtk+-2.0 libxml-2.0) were not met.
[09:01] <Pavi> or save that data in other partition using windows
[09:01] <AlucardRomero> Is there a tutorial or how-to on how to enable wireless Broadcom cards under Ubuntu?
[09:01] <gotit> those drive are unpartitioned guys
[09:01] <Pavi> so no data

[09:05] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> what the heck!!! to install chinese language support
[09:05] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: the only issue with installing vmware server are three lacking dependencies in a default install of Ubuntu: GCC, make and the headers
[09:05] <gotit> hey guys its askin me to prepare partitions how should i
[09:05] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: Good suggestion, will do that

[09:06] <Janchi> Shadow_mil: once these dependencies are met, it is a matter of running sudo ./vmware-install.pl
[09:06] <particleman> to Ubuntu Dapper and Firefox 1.5.x
[09:07] <ubuntu> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Are there other files in the directory?

[09:11] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:11] <hydro> I have downloaded the Edgy (6.10) Live CD ISO and burned it to a few CD-Rs ... I want to give them to some of my friends who have been dealing with the pain of Windows. However, I am in China and they all prefer to use Chinese characters for the language and they speak various dialects of Mandarin. When I tried Edgy on my laptop, the re was no language choice for Mandarin. Any ideas (thanks cntb)
[09:11] <ubuntu> gotit: You need to register your nick

[09:14] <gimmulf> How do i update my nameserver?
[09:14] <Pavi> go to partition table
[09:14] <ubuntu> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Don't press tab, put the same number of question marks as there are characters, just be carefull as it will also delete any other files in the directory that have the same number of characters, that is why you should use the -i switch

[09:27] <Jordan_U> anto: Try editing the boot parameters to just vmlinuz instead of /casper/vmlinuz .
[09:27] <cypher1> how can one control speaker volume from an application ?
[09:27] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ubuntu, :P i can just download the .deb
[09:27] <anto> oki i will try that when i find another power cable :P
[09:28] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> for the language-support-zh
[09:28] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> then i don't need to get all those other files i don't need :D (which apt-get wants)
[09:29] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, the .deb will not instal without all its dependancies
[09:29] <bilss_> DBO: How's the coffee these days?
[09:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> devilsadvocate, not all depencies are needed
[09:30] <duck_> is there such a piece of hardware as this? dsl-modem, wireless router, print-server -all in one box?
[09:30] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, dpkg wont let you install afaik
[09:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> it's just that apt-get wants to get all dependencies, even the ones that you don't need
[09:30] <cwillu> duck_: well you could make a linux box doing that
[09:30] <duck_> hmmm, that's a good idea
[09:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i'll give you example
[09:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i want to simply install chinese support on the command line, but it wants to download "openoffice.org-style-default openoffice.org-writer"
[09:31] <duck_> cwillu: I could get a small compter to function as a modem as well?
[09:31] <cwillu> duck_, otherwise, just try poking around on dlink and linksys and see if they show anything interesting
[09:31] <cwillu> sure
[09:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> >.<... i just don't need it, and it doesn't need those packages for it to install
[09:31] <cwillu> duck_:  internal dsl modem
[09:32] <duck_> cwillu: d-link and linksys have router-modem and router-print-server
[09:32] <duck_> cwillu: but no modem-print/server/router
[09:32] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> another example is compiling things from source
[09:32] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: A .deb will do the same thing, you need to tell dpkg to ignore dependencies to keep those from being installed.
[09:32] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> really? damm
[09:32] <cwillu> duck_: small linux box is probably your best bet
[09:33] <Djavdet> Hi all
[09:34] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> anyways that shouldn't be too hard :)
[09:34] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> man dpkg
[09:35] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Why not just install what you want, the package you are installing is probably just a meta package, just look at it's dependencies and decide which of them you want to isntall and insall them.
[09:35] <Jordan_U> *install
[09:36] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> it's 116/117 megs of download, and 300+ meg expanded
[09:36] <cherubiel> Hinata_sama|iBoo: thats not true, apt-get builds a dependency graph , only the required packages are installed - it reccomnends ome packages though, which is not essential
[09:36] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> >.<... i have very limited bandwidth and HD space
[09:36] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> damm ISP monopoly down here
[09:37] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, what package are you trying to install?
[09:37] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> support-language-zh
[09:37] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: That is the size of it and it's dependencies, it itself could contain no actuall data.
[09:37] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, that seems to be a ghost package
[09:37] <Jordan_U> !meta-package | Hinata_sama|iBoo
[09:37] <ubotu> Hinata_sama|iBoo: A meta-package is a package that simply depends upon other packages and brings them in. It's not a real package, but a very useful package that can drag in other package versions.
[09:38] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> so it won't download 117 megs worth of data?
[09:38] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, it will
[09:38] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> darn
[09:38] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Yes it will, you don't want that package...
[09:39] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: you want some of the things that package depends on.
[09:39] <Jordan_U> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Is this still just to delete that one file ?
[09:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> argh, brb the koi got caught in the net again
[09:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ... and they got back out again
[09:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> lol
[09:40] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, how come i dont find mention of  this package anywhere on the net?
[09:41] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/translations/language-support-zh
[09:41] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i just googled ubuntu chinese support package
[09:41] <Jordan_U> !info support-language-zh
[09:41] <ubotu> Package support-language-zh does not exist in any distro I know
[09:41] <Hellevator> can someone tell me how to edit the MBR?
[09:42] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... Hellevator, what do you want to know?
[09:42] <Jordan_U> Hellevator: To do what?
[09:42] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> >.<... editing the MBR can become quite a complicated excersize
[09:42] <Hellevator> I just installed FC6 to test it out but told it not to install a boot loader.  Now I want to edit grub to add the fedora partition
[09:42] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ah
[09:43] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... take a look at fdisk
[09:43] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo,  scim-tables-zh
[09:43] <devilsadvocate> Hinata_sama|iBoo, _maybe_
[09:43] <Hellevator> can you give me any more detailed information?
[09:44] <cwillu> !oem
[09:44] <ubotu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues
[09:44] <Jordan_U> Hellevator: sudo update-grub ? I don't understand why you need to change the MBR, do you need to set the boot flag?
[09:45] <Hellevator> jordan_u I need to edit grub to add the fedora partition I installed.  I'm not sure if i need to edit the MBR or just grub
[09:45] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> just update grub
[09:45] <devilsadvocate> Hellevator, you have grub itself installed?
[09:45] <Hellevator> yeah ubuntu installed grub
[09:45] <Jordan_U> Hellevator: sudo update-grub should do it automatically.
[09:45] <devilsadvocate> Hellevator, wont just editif menu.list work?
[09:46] <devilsadvocate> Hellevator, wont just editing menu.list work?
[09:46] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... i did a "sudo at"
[09:46] <Hellevator> I'm not sure, i haven't done it before
[09:46] <Hellevator> I will try it
[09:46] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> erm... sudo at *time*
[09:46] <Jordan_U> Hellevator: It is only LILO that changes the MBR when you change configuration.
[09:46] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> and entered a command
[09:46] <deep__> How do i check how much space i have left on my discs?
[09:46] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> do i need to use a command to save/exit at?
[09:46] <Daviey> Does ubuntu edgy use usplash or splashy as the boot splash screen?
[09:46] <deep__> harddrives
[09:46] <Hellevator> hinata_sama why would sudo update grub do it?
[09:47] <cwillu> is it possible to do an oem config from an already install ubuntu?
[09:47] <Daviey> deep__, from the console or in x>?
[09:47] <deep__> Console =)
[09:47] <devilsadvocate> deep__,  typ 'df' in th console
[09:47] <deep__> Thanx :D
[09:47] <Daviey> deep__,   in console use df -h
[09:47] <Jordan_U> Hellevator: update-grub tells grub to look for new bootable partitions
[09:48] <Daviey> deep__, the -h means human readable (ie showing in megs and gigs rather than bytes)

[10:03] <KomiaPoika> hi
[10:03] <KomiaPoika> is there a noob friendly guide to setup iptables firewall for local router?
[10:04] <monokrome> iptables arn't very newb friendl
[10:04] <monokrome> friendly*
[10:04] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> try firehol
[10:04] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ^_^ very easy to setup a secure fire in litterly seconds :D
[10:04] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> *firewall
[10:04] <KomiaPoika> monokrome: i have to get on it
[10:05] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> *firehol generates iptable rules for ya ;)
[10:06] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> firehol by default drops all traffic, unless explicitly specified
[10:07] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> it's litterly this easy to allow some kinda traffic to some service
[10:07] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> e.g. server "http ssh ftp"   accept
[10:07] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> :D
[10:08] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ^_^ separating rules for local and internet going sides of your traffic is soooo easy to control with firehol :D

[10:09] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> rules here

[10:14] <enjee> is there someone who installed a i686 compiled kernel instead of a generic one?
[10:14] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> there's a repo for that somewhere
[10:15] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ah
[10:15] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> well... then you'll could try compiling it from source :D
[10:16] <makoki_bcn> i need some help with ubuntu, need to install a usb-wifi which comes along with Comtren 536+, and i've tried too many times to install it with no results
[10:18] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... why isn't there a at.allow, created by default in ubuntu?
[10:18] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> or cron.log?
[10:19] <kayxray> Is it possible to set Ubuntu up to auto-login a default user?
[10:19] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> erm... it is...
[10:19] <PecisDarbs> Anyone has ipw3945 on Edgy? It doesn't show up in list of interfaces, altough module is loaded properly, I can see it with lsmod
[10:19] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> but i'm not sure how... ^_^ leave it like that kayxray it's more secure

[10:24] <hoto> Hello, when I try to run Ubuntu in 1024x768 with 85Hz, it displays a refresh rate of 87Hz, and the screen looks like a TV screen that isn't correctly configured...

[10:24] <hoto> Hinata_sama|iBoo: Yes.
[10:25] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> do you know the exact H refresh rates + V rates?
[10:25] <juliux> any ideas why ubuntu is not working on a via epia system?
[10:26] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> place the minimum + maximum for both of the refresh rates
[10:26] <hoto> In my xorg.conf, my HorizSync is 30-70, and my VertRefresh is 60-85

[10:29] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> lol, ubuntu doesn't have a at.allow by default!
[10:29] <iLLf8d> I was gonna tell him to gofish and find his monitor specs and remake his xorg.conf
[10:29] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> but has an at.deny
[10:29] <RAMiN> hello all, i just ordered the free ubuntu 6.06 cds, how long will it take for them to ship it here if i live in seattle
[10:29] <iLLf8d> or drop to 800x600 and check what xvidtune output shows as his allowed freqs
[10:30] <RAMiN> seattle, washington
[10:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> you need to know your exact min+max refresh rates of your monitor, for the  xorg.conf for H+V refresh thing though
[10:30] <iLLf8d> RAMiN, takes about 2 mo
[10:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> alot faster than it takes to get down here
[10:30] <RAMiN> dude, you kidding me
[10:30] <iLLf8d> RAMiN, but if you select express shipping for 40$ they come in 3 days
[10:30] <iLLf8d> yeah I'm joking heh
[10:30] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> nah, in the US it's alot faster
[10:31] <RAMiN> okay good
[10:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> >.<... where i live, everything takes ages to come down
[10:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i hear it takes about 2weeks
[10:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> over there
[10:31] <RAMiN> that's nice
[10:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> for me... i waited about 1 1/2 months
[10:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> <= australia :P
[10:31] <RAMiN> cause they accepted my cds on the 13th of november

[10:38] <RAMiN> i love http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[10:38] <Fator_Dee> it's there, the link to the actual part of the guide was long so I didn't paste it :-p
[10:38] <RAMiN> those guys are so helpful

[10:38] <bigz> cheers Fator_Dee :)
[10:38] <Fator_Dee> long like that
[10:38] <variant> bigz: ah, you will need to use either the somewhat experimental native write support or captive ntfs which is foolproof
[10:39] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> XD you beat me to it
[10:39] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> if you want to write to an NTFS partition... i recommend NTFSg
[10:39] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> it's quite stable, i certainly haven't had a problem with it :D
[10:39] <gotit> what filesystem type should i select when installing ubuntu
[10:40] <enyc> gotit: leave defaults (i.e. ext3)
[10:40] <anto> can somone tell me what, isolinux: disk error 80, AX = 4200, drive 9f means?
[10:40] <Fator_Dee> but, has anyone in here experience in adding a SATA-hdd, and it borking the former /dev/-order?
[10:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmmm... it's not called NTFSg actually...
[10:40] <gotit> ok
[10:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ah!!
[10:40] <anto> anyone?
[10:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> NTFS-3G
[10:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> that's the one :D
[10:40] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> anto, what do you plan to use the OS for?
[10:41] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> if you want some performance... i recommend XFS
[10:41] <anto> Lamp
[10:41] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> (great for howuse)
[10:41] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> *home use
[10:41] <gotit> performance what do you mean
[10:41] <anto> Hinata_sama i want to use it for a server for my homepage
[10:41] <enyc> ext3 is always safe-bet... other filesystems like reiser3 reiser4 xfs jfs have various benefits for some situations... and some caveats!
[10:42] <gamboos> does anyone know what this means 'GLERROR: cannot access OpenGL library libGL.so' ?
[10:42] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> yea
[10:42] <gotit> situtions like what
[10:42] <anto> but when i insert the live cd into the computer it starts up then i got 30 seconds to select what i want to do so i select, start or install ubuntu
[10:42] <enyc> like xfs was made for sgi hardware where the hardware could signal powerfail to the OS... does not have this safety on pc hardware!
[10:42] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> xfs, one of the fastest overall, things like reading file names, creating files, reading files etc
[10:42] <anto> it loads the linux kernel to 4% then it chrashes
[10:43] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> and doesn't use as much system resources as a FS like reiser
[10:43] <anto> I/0 error reading boot cd. reboot
[10:43] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i read a comparison somewhere
[10:43] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> oh! if you chouse XFS
[10:43] <anto> xfs ?

[10:59] <MattJ> Hinata_sama|iBoo: What's the problem?
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> MattJ, trying to use "at"
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i did a sudo at now
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> then
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> eject
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> :( it's not doing it
[10:59] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> do i have to exit at in some special way?
[11:00] <MattJ> Pres Ctrl+D
[11:00] <Tomcat_> Hinata_sama|iBoo: at reads from stdin, so you have to Ctrl+D.
[11:00] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ah
[11:00] <Fator_Dee> Tomcat_: do you know how I could change the size of the ext3's journal when formatting this drive?
[11:00] <MattJ> Caught me out first time too :)
[11:00] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ^_^ thanks guys
[11:00] <MattJ> np
[11:00] <Balachmar> I have a question about sessions, I want to add a startup program, and I know how to do this, but Ubuntu immediately forgets this
[11:00] <Fator_Dee> 15gigs sounds a little high even for 320gig hd
[11:00] <gamboos> anyone know why i get the error 'GLERROR: cannot access OpenGL library libGL.so'
[11:01] <Balachmar> How do I get Ubuntu to remember the startup programs
[11:01] <variant> Balachmar: system > prefs > startup
[11:02] <bimberi> s/startup/session, startup tab/
[11:02] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32: hey are you there. i just found out that the domain im trying to connect to is a windows 2003 server
[11:02] <bimberi> +s
[11:02] <Tomcat_> Fator_Dee: Well... just pass the options to mkfs.ext3... but I have never done that.
[11:02] <kud0s> topcat_: top says the my cpu is being used 100% but id (im assumind idle) also its running very low on ram
[11:02] <Balachmar> yes I know but, if I fill in something there
[11:02] <Fator_Dee> Tomcat_: never have I :-/
[11:02] <Balachmar> And I save it and then open that window again it is gone
[11:03] <variant> kud0s: 100% idle means it's not being used. your ram is being used for cache, to speed up applications and files. to see the real amount of ram thats actualy _in use_ use vmstat
[11:04] <variant> Balachmar: odd, sounds like a bug
[11:05] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> :D nice! XD... using the at command, doesn't leave stuff in a log!
[11:05] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> haha
[11:05] <kud0s> thanks variant: but no processes are using any more than 0.5% of cpy why do i have a 3.00 3.00 3.00 load average ?
[11:05] <variant> kud0s: that cached ram is imediately swapped out or cleared if annother program requires access to ram.. you can configure the swappiness to change the behavioiur
[11:05] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> (the things i could do on my campus's linux labs computers...
[11:05] <patrick_king> exit
[11:06] <variant> kud0s: have you done any cpu intenseive tasks since the system first booted?
[11:06] <kud0s> shouldne the load average be less than 1.00
[11:06] <kud0s> no
[11:07] <variant> kud0s: not really, the load average should be an average of what you have been doing.. if you just booted then there is a spike as the boot and application startup usess a lot of cpu.. the average will come down over time
[11:07] <variant> kud0s: it's nothing to worry about
[11:07] <Fator_Dee> Tomcat_: ok, found it out
[11:08] <Fator_Dee> thanks 'nyways
[11:08] <kud0s> variant; thanks that makes me feel better i was ust wondering if the system was dying
[11:08] <variant> kud0s: hehe
[11:09] <gotit> tell /media/hda1 is this for swap or "/" is for swap
[11:09] <variant> gotit: what?
=== pc5 is now known as cwe^MaNiEzZ
[11:09] <gotit> i am installing ubuntu
[11:09] <gotit> its asking for two partions
[11:09] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... i really should make myself a backup script
[11:09] <gotit> why two
[11:10] <variant> gotit: one for swap and one for root (/)
[11:10] <gotit> media/hda1 for swap than i guess
[11:10] <gotit> swap should be smaller in size  i guess
[11:11] <variant> gotit: windows uses a swap file if i recall, that means that when the hard disk is getting full there is less and less swap available. this is bad. having it on a seperate parititon also makes it more efficient. you should put it on the fastest part of the disk (outside edge)
[11:11] <variant> gotit: no, you don't mount swap at all.. it wont have a mount point
[11:11] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> or even better, on another disk all together!
[11:11] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ;)
[11:11] <gotit> but its asking for 2 partitions
[11:11] <variant> Hinata_sama|iBoo: or even better, several fast small disks with pri=0 set on all of them in fstab
[11:12] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> well yea :P
[11:12] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> if you have $$$
[11:12] <variant> gotit: yes, one parititon should be swap.. you dont have to mount it anywhere (you can't/shouldnt)
[11:12] <gotit> default /,1gb and media/hda1 20 gb by default
[11:12] <dreamer> in KDE: where can I define what programs to run @ startup ?
[11:12] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> well... you *can*
[11:12] <variant> gotit: is tehre allready data on this disk?
[11:12] <ruxpin^> how can I change the default firefox home page -- I've set the pref to /etc/firefox/pref/firefox.js but I still get the xubuntu welcome page
[11:12] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> or you can do it in init.d
[11:13] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> erm...
[11:13] <gotit> yes but on diff partition
[11:13] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: where is this ?
[11:13] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> where is inittab gone?
[11:13] <gotit> thats 10 gb
[11:13] <variant> gotit: the ubuntu installer seems to be giviing you one partition for ubuntu and mounting your other in /media/
[11:13] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> just a sec, i forgot what the thing is called
[11:13] <dreamer> haha
[11:13] <gotit> what that media ??
[11:14] <variant> gotit: it is a part of the filesystem tree on ubuntu
[11:14] <gotit> like audio or video
[11:14] <dreamer> like: disk this, disk that, cd-rom, dvd
[11:14] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> where's inittab gone?
[11:14] <variant> gotit: you have to understand that / is the roots of the tree and everything else grows out of it.. so /media is a directory under / as is /home/username/ etc etc
[11:15] <variant> lol that doesnt help
[11:15] <gotit> why its asking for 1 gb space than if its for cd or dvd
[11:16] <zack> anybody here know anything about gFTP's Filespec? I'm trying to filter out all files which have a tilde (~) suffic
[11:17] <variant> gotit: this seems a bit confusing for you i understand..
[11:17] <zack> ...suffix
[11:17] <gotit> and what does this mount actually mean like format or partition
[11:17] <gotit> yeah i am new to it
[11:18] <dreamer> it means the system can access/use it
[11:18] <variant> gotit: mount is what happens when you plug in a disk and want to access a partition.. it just gives you access to the partition (referenced by /dev/hda1 for example) at a convenient location.. such as /media/mynewdisk
[11:18] <dreamer> instead of (windews style) c:/ d:/ e:/ etc
[11:19] <variant> gotit: in gnu/linux the first partition on the first hard disk is called /dev/hda1 if its a standard ata disk
[11:19] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> dreamer, vim /etc/rc.local
[11:19] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ;)
[11:19] <variant> gotit: the second parititon would be /dev/hda2
[11:19] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: yay :)
[11:19] <variant> gotit: the first partiiton of the second hard disk would then be /dev/hdb1
[11:19] <variant> gotit: you follow?
[11:20] <gotit> like i am goint to install ubuntu on the new disk and want to access the old ubuntu partitions i will mount old ones
[11:20] <gotit> gotit
[11:20] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: I can just add a program and possible prefix' ?
[11:20] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> dunno why ubuntu likes to put things in funny places
[11:20] <dreamer> haha
[11:20] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> sure,
[11:21] <variant> gotit: so you have a new hard disk? it sounds like the automatic partitioner has just guessed what it thinks you want.. its better to do manual partiitoning in this case or you will certainly loose your data
[11:21] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> e.g. www-data  cd /var/www/tf/bin && php fluxcli.php start-all
[11:21] <variant> gotit: to be really sure you should take out hte old hard disk _before_ you install ubuntu
[11:21] <variant> gotit: and make sure you backup your old data
[11:21] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> dreamer, i recommend you just stuff whatever you want to run into a bash script :D
[11:21] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: I just need it for synergys , no prefix' there ;)
[11:22] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> keeps things tidy
[11:22] <gotit> so than how i willbe able to access the old hard drive ubuntu partitions
[11:22] <dreamer> hmm
[11:22] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> hmm... i need to take a look at wget again
[11:22] <zack> variant: i always try to wing it - still haven't killed my data by leaving an important drive in there... still i guess i should be much more careful :-S :P ;)
[11:22] <variant> gotit: put it back in once ubuntu is installed on the new disk.. i only suggest this because from what you say you don't seem to have much experience.. it's safer
[11:23] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> woo! curl can do mult-segmented downloads!!!
[11:23] <dreamer> hmm, whats curl :#
[11:23] <mamzers555> !curl
[11:23] <ubotu> curl: Get a file from an HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or GOPHER server. In component main, is optional. Version 7.15.4-1ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 157 kB, installed size 256 kB
[11:23] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> it's a download manager like wget, but much more powerful :D
[11:23] <gotit> just like puting it back i will be able to access the old hard drive ubuntu partions, no mounting will be required than
[11:23] <dreamer> get*
[11:24] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> i hear it's awesome for... uh... downloading... *cough*
[11:24] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> XD
[11:24] <dreamer> why you coughing ;)
[11:24] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> *wink* *wink*
[11:24] <FirstStrike> Wink Wink
[11:24] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> with some switch, you can download e.g. XXXXXX[1-50] .jpg
[11:25] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ;)
[11:25] <Fator_Dee> how do I add my new partition to /dev/disk/by-uuid, I can't mount it now because it isn't there?
[11:25] <chatainsim> irc://irc.bitmetv.org/bitmetv
[11:25] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: how do you mean ?
[11:25] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> let's say there was some movie that was split into multiple files
[11:25] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> and hosted on some site
[11:25] <gotit> one last thing  "/" root partion should be more than "/media/hda1" i have to swap them i guess cause  / size is 1gb and media size is 20 gb
[11:26] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> instead of manualy clicking on the each movie download
[11:26] <KomiaPoika> how can i setup dns on a local network?
[11:26] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> you could just downloaded the whole batch of files via a easy to use command
[11:26] <gotit> anybody ??
[11:26] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> KomiaPoika, there's a really nice guide for that
[11:26] <dreamer> Hinata_sama|iBoo: all the seperate files should be in a single folder and you could just recursively downlead that folder :P
[11:27] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> http://www.howtoforge.com/taxonomy_menu/1/1/50
[11:27] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> ;) have fun
[11:27] <KomiaPoika> thanks
[11:27] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> dreamer, but some times the site doesn't allow "listing" of files
[11:27] <dreamer> hmz, I need to buy some new hd's ;/
[11:27] <dreamer> ok
[11:27] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> you need to absolute path
[11:28] <gotit> what about me guys
[11:28] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> thus this is useful :D
[11:28] <zack> anybody here know anything about 3d stereo drivers for linux? i've got some edimensional 3d glasses i'd love to try out with beryl/aiglx
[11:28] <bimberi> KomiaPoika: there is documentation on setting it up via System -> Help (server, network, DNS)
[11:29] <gotit> grub is going to install on hd0 is this right
[11:29] <bimberi> gotit: do you only have 1 drive?
[11:29] <gotit> i am not getting answers but still asking for more
[11:29] <gotit> yeah
[11:30] <bimberi> gotit: then that's right
[11:30] <gotit> but different partition
[11:30] <bimberi> gotit refers to the drive as a whole, not a particular partition.  Is this a Desktop CD install?
[11:30] <gotit> yes
[11:31] <bimberi> gotit: sorry, hd0 refers...
[11:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> nice DNS server guide ;)
[11:31] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p4
[11:31] <bimberi> gotit, ok, that will install grub into the master boot record of the drive.  usually fine
[11:31] <dreamer> anybody here familiar with DAAP ?
[11:32] <dreamer> I have some trouble connecting to my server
[11:32] <progek> a friend of mine is running windows xp but would like to also have ubuntu for a dual boot. He has ntfs, would there be any problems dual booting?
[11:32] <bimberi> Hinata_sama|iBoo: except it's wrong, should recommend installing bind9 (which is in main) and not bind (which is in universe)
[11:32] <dreamer> I run mt-daapd on a debian server and have dapper on my desktop
[11:32] <dreamer> progek: no promlem, just better not te write an ntfs
[11:32] <gotit> ok now after install i need to unplug the drive and put it in different sys to access those other ubuntu partition, is it possible
[11:32] <dreamer> still too risky
[11:33] <progek> ok thanks
[11:33] <dreamer> damn my typing sucks again today
[11:33] <gotit> bimberi:cause i have to edit the menu.lst
[11:33] <dreamer> so, anybody can help with DAAP-problem? :S
[11:34] <slayertry> um
[11:34] <slayertry> so how do i get nvidia to actually work in edgy>???
[11:34] <slayertry> !nvidia
[11:34] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[11:34] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> bibleboy, it does
[11:34] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> "apt-get install bind9"
[11:35] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> erm bimberi
[11:35] <bimberi> gotit: sorry, you need to give me more detail
[11:35] <knix> I just got the pre-built w32codecs (had to build own package before) and output is very bright when using Xv for video output (x11 works fine) can anyone help?
[11:35] <bimberi> Hinata_sama|iBoo: hm?
[11:36] <gotit> bimberi: i have to edit the menu.lst on other system, for which i dont have access, and i am installing ubuntu on this other system to access that partion
[11:36] <bimberi> Hinata_sama|iBoo: nvm, which guide are you referring to?
[11:36] <zack> knix: try fiddling with video settings a la Kaffeine (press 'V')
[11:36] <bimberi> i'm looking at the one via System -> Help
[11:36] <slayertry> hmm
[11:37] <slayertry> i think this thing has onboard nvidia card... i dont exactly see it in lspci.. is there another way to tell??
[11:37] <bimberi> gotit: ah, ok.  no CD on the other system I assume?
[11:37] <knix> zack: what settings? This happens in all video players playing a codec in w32codecs using xv for output, works fine in x11/xshm
[11:37] <gotit> bimberi: no it has one
[11:37] <bimberi> gotit: you can boot off a LiveCD, mount the drive and edit menu.lst that way
[11:38] <nikko> Hi to all. I have installed Gnome under Kubuntu. With "apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop" can i remove it? Or there is any other way to remove it? Thnaks
[11:38] <knix> zack: it's not player specific =/
[11:38] <gotit> bimberi:really, is it like that , is so simple than
[11:38] <zack> knix: sure, i was just offering a quick fix ;)  i have no idea with codecs, really
[11:39] <knix> zack: ah, thanks anyway.
[11:39] <gotit> bimberi: i am confused that mount will change something on that system or any other kind of instability
[11:39] <bimberi> gotit: fairly simple, yes.  no, mounting the drive from a LiveCD boot is fine.
[11:40] <gotit> bimberi:ok i will try it then , and to edit the menu.lst should i use the command line or can i do it form the ubuntu explorer
[11:41] <bimberi> gotit: command line is probably easier
[11:41] <slytherin> luca: ping
[11:41] <luca> slytherin: ping
[11:42] <iwkse> hi all. Anybody had problems in refreshing with ati+xgl+beryl? It just works great, but seems to don't refresh and is needed to move the window for keep the change (eg. when click on the progressbar)
[11:42] <gotit> bimberi: haha , why is that explorer should be more easier, i right click the file open it change it and close it and its done , i guess
[11:43] <luca> slytherin: in general, how would I use an clipse program?
[11:43] <bimberi> gotit: sure.  it's the mounting of the drive that's easier via command line
[11:43] <luca> I do not really know...
[11:43] <bimberi> gotit: it would be something like 'sudo mount /dev/hd?? /mnt'  then  'sudo gedit /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst'
[11:44] <slytherin> luca: bioclipse is a plugin for eclipse. you will need to manually unjar and copy files to approriate directories.
[11:44] <luca> slytherin: how would I do that?
[11:44] <slytherin> luca: Let me find solution for you.
[11:45] <gotit> bimberi: i didnt see the command line option while booting from live cd
[11:45] <dreamer> crapw I just installed nvidia drivers over my nv-drivers .. rebooted X (there was made a backup .. not sure where) and now X won't start
[11:45] <zack> anyone here know about linux stereo drivers for 3d glasses?
[11:45] <dreamer> does anybody know where the backup was made and how to activate it
[11:45] <luca> slytherin: thanks a lot!
[11:45] <bimberi> gotit: i mean to open a terminal once the live session boots :)
[11:45] <slytherin> luca: Have you installed eclipse form repositories?
[11:46] <luca> slytherin: yes
[11:46] <luca> slytherin: biolinux repositories
[11:46] <bimberi> dreamer: ls -l xorg.conf*   (perhaps there is a recent backup of xorg.conf there)
[11:46] <gotit> bimberi: hmm , terminal ?? i am not used to this term sir, can u tell me little more specific
[11:47] <gotit> :-)
[11:47] <bimberi> gotit: sure,  Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
[11:47] <dreamer> bimberi: in what dir ?
[11:47] <slytherin> luca: As I said bioeclipse is just a plugin. You will first need to install eclipse from official repositories.
[11:47] <gotit> bimberi:gotit :-)
[11:47] <bimberi> dreamer: sorry,  /etc/X11  (D'Oh)
[11:47] <bimberi> gotit: lol
[11:47] <dreamer> bimberi: there is only one
[11:47] <luca> slytherin: well I thought I had O_o
[11:48] <bimberi> dreamer: hm, not that file then.  Apart from that I don't know sorry
[11:48] <dreamer> anybody else ?
[11:48] <luca> slytherin: which repo would you suggest? I used http://envgen.nox.ac.uk/bio-linux/
[11:48] <luca> slytherin: I thought it was official :)
[11:48] <bimberi> dreamer: you can always reconfigure X and select nv ...
[11:49] <bimberi> !xconfig | dreamer
[11:49] <ubotu> dreamer: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[11:49] <gotit> bimberi: well its installing the ubuntu now, when its finnished , i will try it on this sys and then do it where the real prob is :-)
[11:49] <bimberi> gotit: righto
[11:49] <katerine> hi
[11:49] <katerine> how to configure alsa in edgy ?
[11:49] <katerine> alsaconf doesn't work anymore
[11:50] <CptAJ[vzla] > question: Is there any CLI only distribution out there? Im setting up an older system as a webserver and I dont want X or any of that jazz. I tried DSL but their documentation is horribly sketchy on the matter
[11:50] <gotit> bimberi: thanks bemberi i appriciate the help and concern
[11:50] <bimberi> katerine: i'm fairly sure alsaconf never was in Ubuntu
[11:50] <cbx33> anyone know how to get ubuntu to display on a digital projector and on the screen at the same time?
[11:50] <bimberi> gotit: np, good luck :)
[11:50] <katerine> bimberi: how to do then ?
[11:51] <bimberi> !sound
[11:51] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[11:51] <bimberi> katerine: ^^^^ (all I know)
[11:51] <CptAJ[vzla] > a guide or thread on the matter of stripping DSL from X would do just fine...
[11:51] <slytherin> luca: My misunderstanding. Just wait. I guess bioclise itself is a modified eclipse
[11:52] <bimberi> cbx33: is there a toggle of some sort (Fn -> F8 on my laptop but they vary)?
[11:52] <cbx33> yes but not sure Xorg picks that up
[11:52] <cbx33> that key shows no visible signs of doing anything
[11:52] <cbx33> any other ideas?
[11:52] <bimberi> cbx33: not sure then sorry :/
[11:53] <slytherin> luca: Considering you have installed everything from the repository you mentioned, can you run 'bioclipse' from gnome-terminal?
[11:53] <bimberi> cbx33: hi btw :)
[11:53] <luca> wait..
[11:53] <luca> well not bioclipse
[11:54] <katerine> bimberi: I get this 'Your audio capture settings are invalid. Please correct them in the Multimedia settings.' when running gnome-sound-recorder
[11:54] <luca> eclipse I have, bioclipse I have downloaded it from the site
[11:54] <slytherin> luca: Can you once tell me what have you downloaded? Name of the file.
[11:54] <blufox> how do i set up a local repository using apt-cacher in Ubuntu?
[11:55] <nofxx> I installed mysql trhought synaptic, but I don't want to start it on boot... where to comment that line ?
[11:55] <luca> sorry -i have downloaded the eclipse package from the biolinux repo
[11:55] <luca> then I went to the sourceforge and downloaded bioclipse
[11:55] <blufox> nofxx: stop it using bum
[11:55] <katerine> when alsamixer, it returns : 'alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device'
[11:56] <blufox> install bum and stop mysql server
[11:56] <fyrestrtr> nofxx: sudo update-rc.d mysql stop
[11:56] <nofxx> hmm...ok...let me find bum
[11:56] <nofxx> ahh cool fyrestrtr , tnx

[12:19] <gelse> or - other way around - anyone has an idea what the error means: "ABI version mismatch 1.5.x (need 2.0.x)" - and why a package without any use is in the reps?

[12:20] <Barber> do i id in konsole shell

[12:20] <peer123> the auth process is failing while calling " sudo pon dsl-provider " though i'm sure my user/pass are correct.
[12:20] <fyrestrtr> FluxD: if you want to try beryl with aiglx, then you need the 'ati' driver.
[12:21] <peer123> I corrected the chap/pap secrets file, but still, it is not working
[12:21] <gelse> FluxD: i'd say fglrx are more problem to get to work, but you give better performance than the ati ones.

[12:22] <Barber> i am there but they arent
[12:23] <gelse> well - the main difference between aiglx and xgl is that GL is still working for apps unter aiglx
[12:23] <lect0r> Its a pain in the side to download the deb files separately.

[12:33] <lect0r> fyrestrtr: on windows (stupid question, i know). Bridging means enabling one NIC to use another NIC's connection, am I right?
[12:33] <syock> fyrestrtr: thx for telling me strace. now i know why winetools won`t run in AMD64
[12:33] <sandy16> how to build custom apt-cdrom (with required packages) ?
[12:34] <peer123> fyrestrtr : I use the pppoe interface in m$ win XP
[12:34] <fyrestrtr> lect0r: yes, but vmware will set that up for you, it does that when it installs itself, and also is an option in the VM's option dialog.
[12:34] <Daviey> Hi, has anybody here made a usplash file?
[12:34] <fyrestrtr> peer123: are you dual booting?
[12:35] <uksprout> just about to install Ubuntu any suggestions/recommendations or the like before I start?
[12:35] <Daviey> uksprout, are you doing it onto a clean hd?
[12:35] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: check minimum requirements on the website.
[12:35] <peer123> fyrestrtr: yes ubuntu dapper / winXP using GRUB
[12:35] <Daviey> uksprout, ie; are you going to partition?
[12:35] <uksprout> yes... new 200gb drive I meet all the specs
[12:35] <fyrestrtr> peer123: you have read the pppoe writeup at the wiki?
[12:35] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: sata?
[12:36] <bimberi> Daviey: no, but there is a usplash howto on the wiki ...
[12:36] <Daviey> uksprout, nothing then... installing is a breeze and if you want to come back here after.  open the console and type "sudo apt-get install xchat" which will give you an IRC client
[12:36] <bimberi> !usplash | Daviey
[12:36] <ubotu> Daviey: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[12:36] <Daviey> bimberi, it's shockingly out of date
[12:36] <fyrestrtr> Daviey: xchat comes with edgy :)
[12:37] <uksprout> no IDE, my only real concern is my video card.. Nvidia Ge force fx 5200 I *need* the TV out option to work this is *very* importatnt for me
[12:37] <Daviey> fyrestrtr, are you sure?  i had to install it on a fresh install last night?
[12:37] <peer123> fyrestrtr: which wiki ? the official one ?
[12:37] <peer123> fyrestrtr: or the ubuntu guide ?
[12:37] <fyrestrtr> Daviey: there is a 'dumbed down' version of it, not the full xchat.
[12:37] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: you should not have any problems, as nvidia makes very good linux drivers.
[12:37] <bimberi> Daviey: ah, you'd better update it then :)
[12:38] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: after you get the system running, head to the wiki to install the binary nvidia drivers to get your tv-out working.
[12:38] <gelse> fyrestrtr: so you dont have an idea (gaim-xmms-remote package that is)
[12:38] <Daviey> bimberi, i will when i have it done.  I have successfully built an so file.  But when i try to use it - i get a black screen
[12:38] <Nlyt1> hi, i cant have 2 apps playing sounds at the same time, ie rhythm + teamspeak, i've followed the howto on getting sound working properly with gnome, but no such luck
[12:38] <fyrestrtr> gelse: sorry, I am just a simpleton that uses my linux laptop for work :)
[12:38] <gelse> :9
[12:38] <fyrestrtr> Nlyt1: you need to install the dmix plugin for alsa.
[12:38] <peer123> fyrestrtr: I read the wiki
[12:38] <bimberi> Daviey: kk, i'll stop nagging you then ;p
[12:38] <gelse> np, i just have to start somewhere to ask. ;)
[12:39] <Nlyt1> fyrestrtr: right - ill look it up, thanks :)
[12:39] <uksprout> fyrestrtr: That is what I was told about Mepis (roghly two weeks ago) and I couldn't get it to boot with the correct drivers
[12:40] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: I don't know about mepis, but I have ubuntu running on nvidia hardware, with acceleration + xgl + dual screens.
[12:40] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: and the binary drivers have tv out support (didn't use it in my case)
[12:40] <variant> Nlyt1: alternativly open teamspeak with alsa-oss (apt-get install alsa-oss and then start teamspeak with the aoss command prepended
[12:40] <tengil> Tomcat: figured out my cron problems: my scripts had '.' (dots) in them. run-parts can only take a-zA-Z_ in script names :-)
[12:40] <uksprout> fyrestrtr: U have spent hours and hours trying to get video playback on the tv, everything would display fine (on the tv) but all I got from video apps was a blue screen
[12:41] <variant> uksprout: change the output mode of the videos.. for example mplayer -vo x11 /path/to/file.avi
[12:41] <Daviey> bimberi, i might just give up! and use splashy instead
[12:41] <fyrestrtr> uksprout: that's strange. You need to make sure the right output driver is used, as variant pointed out.
[12:41] <variant> uksprout: there are a bunch of output plugins
[12:43] <bimberi> Daviey: wish i had something to offer :|
[12:43] <uksprout> well the ppl at Mepis checked everything ... even walked me through re-installation and still it didn't work.... well I will go now and do the install once done I will come back and let you know if it is working ..... thanks for the advice all
[12:43] <Nlyt1> variant: whats the aoss command to prepend?
[12:46] <fyrestrtr> Nlyt1: its aoss
[12:47] <Bachstudies> hello everyone...can someone please confirm that they can see this text?

[12:50] <Nlyt1> fyrestrtr: hehe - i got sounds, but no mic now ;(
[12:51] <fyrestrtr> CaptainMorgan: Edit > Preferences > Behavior > Always open in browser windows

[12:51] <MARTA> ubuntu edgy install -  wont see on new lg core duo notebook  wired netcard RT8168/8111 . what is the cure ?
[12:51] <fyrestrtr> lolo: first step is to post /var/log/Xorg.0.log at a pastebin site and then give the link here.
[12:51] <cong0_natty> nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:52] <cong0_natty> and make sure its set up right
[12:52] <r_rehashed> I need Flash player to view a couple of videos in FireFox..  the Flash-player doesn't get installed since mine is an x86_64.. what do I do?
[12:52] <cong0_natty> you might wanna google "xorg help" and the name of your hardware
[12:52] <r_rehashed> I have installed the ia32 libs
[12:52] <cwillu> m'thinks I should have put a gzip|gunzip into my dd|netcat pipe
[12:52] <fyrestrtr> r_rehashed: read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats -- it tells you how to work flash under x64
[12:53] <wimpies> hi all, because of problems with alsa I would like to install the 1.0.13 version which is in debian unstable ... any ubuntu versions available ?
[12:53] <r_rehashed> ok.. thanks
[12:53] <MARTA> fyrestrtr, ?
[12:53] <MARTA> ubuntu edgy wont see on new lg core duo notebook  wired netcard RT8168/8111 . what is the cure ?
[12:53] <eexp16> MARTA: maybe the card isn't supported by linux yet. did you google for it?
[12:53] <cong0_natty> MARTA rephraze your question and you might find help
[12:53] <lolo> what can I do when I get xserver fatal error no screen found? I already did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:53] <fyrestrtr> MARTA: first, find out what module it uses, then compile a kernel with that module.
[12:54] <cong0_natty> dmesg
[12:54] <fyrestrtr> lolo: I told you what to do :)
[12:54] <MARTA> eexp16, pity if not, there is a whole line of beautiful LG notebooks there
[12:54] <cong0_natty> lolo as did i
[12:54] <cong0_natty> nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:54] <fyrestrtr> wimpies: not sure, but you can always compile it from source.
[12:54] <cong0_natty> and google "xorg help" and your video card
[12:55] <cong0_natty> it could be your mouse or keyboard also.
[12:55] <hect0r> eexp16: come to think of it, how often do the good people at kernel.org update it for compatibility? Does linux kernels fully utilize the Core2Duo processors now?
[12:55] <wimpies> if I install the debian package should I be OK when newer ubuntu's become available
[12:55] <eexp16> MARTA: try sudo modprobe r8169
[12:55] <lolo> fyrestrtr sorry i didnt read, could you please tell me again?
[12:56] <fyrestrtr> 14:51 < fyrestrtr> lolo: first step is to post /var/log/Xorg.0.log at a pastebin site and then give the link here.
[12:56] <lolo> ok thank you but, what is pastbin site?
[12:56] <fyrestrtr> !pastebin | lolo
[12:56] <ubotu> lolo: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[12:57] <eexp16> hect0r: the good people at kernel.org can only support hardware if the manufacturer gives them specs. otherwise they have to reverse engineer it, which is very hard. most hardware manufacturers simple ignore linux and the open source community in general.
[12:57] <cwillu> anyone know of a pxe server live cd?
[12:57] <lolo> ok but i can't paste it, I have to write it manually
[12:57] <lolo> it says something about no screen found
[12:57] <fyrestrtr> lolo: grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log <-- this will narrow down things.

[12:58] <hect0r> stupid poopers. cause I've been trying to find about linux support for the new intel processors. hopefully they'd come through.
[12:58] <fyrestrtr> intel is very good about linux support, what particular feature are you looking for in core duo 2?
[12:59] <eexp16> hect0r: i think the core 2 duo should run just like a smp machine with 2 cpus
[12:59] <snype> exactly
[12:59] <teledyn> anyone know how to build the madwifi module with module-assistant?  madwifi-source doesn't exist.
[12:59] <MARTA_> wow
[12:59] <snype> idk about now but when they were on the newer side-- the way to get their full performance was using smp
[12:59] <snype> teledyn-- what wifi card do u have?
[12:59] <agutierr> someone knows how I can launch beryl-manager from gmd session, not in gnome startups programs? thanks.
[01:00] <Moriar> hi
[01:00] <lolo> fyrestrtr I already pasted it, what do I do now?
[01:00] <Moriar> is there somebody talking french there ?

[01:02] <lolo> ati 9550
[01:02] <lolo> in mobo with nforce2

[01:04] <lolo> I used this guide (http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide#Installing_the_driver) to install with method 1, and it worked, but when I finally in linux, I changed screen resolution and refresh rate and when I rebooted...the same again
[01:04] <lolo> heh
[01:04] <fyrestrtr> lolo: please use the official wiki when setting up hardware.
[01:04] <lolo> oh ok
[01:04] <fyrestrtr> lolo: third party howtos are not guaranteed to work.
[01:05] <lolo> but it worked
[01:05] <fyrestrtr> did it now?
[01:05] <fyrestrtr> and you are here because.....
[01:05] <lolo> no
[01:05] <eexp16> cntb: i did a quick google search. there are two drivers for this card. r8169 (the one that is included in the official kernel) and r1000 (driver from realtek). i'd try r8169 first.
[01:05] <lolo> now it's not working anymore :'(
[01:05] <variant> Nlyt1: aoss
[01:05] <fyrestrtr> ah right, so its *not* working then :)
[01:06] <lolo> :(
[01:06] <lolo> i cant paste all my screen resolutions, because im not in linux pc
[01:06] <variant> Nlyt1: just add aoss to the start of the command (seperated with a space dont forget)
[01:06] <Bogaurd> can anyone lend a hand with an issue i am having with 'firehol'?
[01:06] <fyrestrtr> lolo: you need to figure it out, because the problem is the color depth that you have chosen (16) is not supported. Change DefaultDepth to something else, like 24 and see if that gets you anywhere.
[01:06] <cntb> ty very much eexp16 so if it is on edgy how come not detected on install. and pls any links ?
[01:07] <fyrestrtr> lolo: make sure you restart X after the change.
[01:07] <teledyn> snype: atheros
[01:08] <ufoz> hi tuxers. i have a question about apt-get/synaptic. is it possible to reduce the download speed if downloading new packages ?
[01:08] <lolo> fyrestrtr ok but I have to do it with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[01:08] <cntb> anyway its a PCI EXPRESS eexp16 ?
[01:09] <tony_> when i install edgy can i keep the files in my /home intact? will i have to reinstall a lot of stuff? can i make an upgrade via torrented cd of does it need to be online- dont want to stress the ubu servers im in no hurry
[01:09] <fyrestrtr> lolo: no, edit the file manually
[01:09] <omkar86> I cannot do upgrade to Edgy using "update-manager -c". what are other safe options?
[01:09] <fyrestrtr> omkar86: why not?
[01:10] <omkar86> i noticed it shows gnome2.14 version, but edgy has 2.16 i guess :)
[01:10] <fyrestrtr> tony_: you need to make sure that your /home is on another partition, otherwise you'll lose the files as the install process will format your disk.
[01:10] <fyrestrtr> omkar86: it should say that a new distribution is available or something like that. It takes it a while to register ;)
[01:10] <omkar86> so upgrade manager isnt considering upgrade to edgy
[01:11] <omkar86> no it doesn't show anything here
[01:11] <tony_> fyrestrtr, any simple cmd line to find out?
[01:11] <cntb> wow other netcard no linux again !! ADMtek ADM8511 USB To Fast Ethernet Converter 2.4.2001.719

[01:12] <omkar86> ok

[01:13] <tony_> fyrestrtr, "/dev/sda1 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)" does that mean my install and home are all on the same partition?
[01:13] <eexp16> cntb: try loading the module manually: sudo modprobe r8169

[01:17] <Motorhead> daviey, ok, hope you solve it soon ^^
=== ChaKy is now known as _ChaKy_
[01:18] <joshua__> is edgy worth upgrading to?
[01:19] <fyrestrtr> tony_: your data and the os are on the same partition; so you should backup your /home before you upgrade.
[01:19] <tony_> fyrestrtr, /dev/sda1 -ext3 used=180gig -boot, /dev/sda2 -extended used=n/a, /dev/sda5 -linux-swap used=n/a,
[01:20] <tony_> fyrestrtr, do u reccomend updating or new install?
[01:20] <fyrestrtr> tony_: it doesn't make a difference if you upgrade or do a new install. Either way, your home and root are on the same partition, and you will lose all files in your home directory.
[01:21] <defrysk> !backup | tony_

[01:30] <YBH_1> do you mean encrypt a drive?
[01:31] <NullP01nt3r> YBH_1, Im looking for something like when the server boots it asks for a pass diff from bios or root pass
[01:31] <uksprout> hi all I'm back and I have a problem
[01:31] <Atomiku> Which software can you recommend to me that lets me use my linux box as a router?
[01:32] <uksprout> ok during setup I tried to use a capital letter in my username the install prog told me I had to use all lowercase so Ichanged it now it is not recognising my username/password
[01:32] <uksprout> can I correct this or do I have to go through a whole new install?
[01:32] <frogzoo> NullP01nt3r: man 8 losetup
[01:32] <frogzoo> Atomiku: linux
[01:32] <levander> uksprout: you don't have to use capital letters in your Linux username
[01:33] <Atomiku> frogzoo: Hmmm?
[01:33] <frogzoo> Atomiku: linux routes without additional s/w
[01:33] <uksprout> no I know that now but I did try.. and it made me change it.... after the install I rebooted and tried to logon but it will not accept my username/password
[01:33] <Atomiku> frogzoo: Ahh okay cool so im gonna get the two network cards plugged into there, one goes to modem one goes to network hub
[01:34] <Atomiku> frogzoo: How do I foward ports?
[01:34] <levander> uksprout: you can try booting off the live CD, mounting the root partition of your linux box, and editing /etc/passwd
[01:34] <webben> uksprout, you can reboot into recovery mode, check your username, and set your password
[01:34] <noika> hey guys
[01:34] <webben> (they still have recovery mode in edgy now don't they? -- from the grub menu?)
[01:34] <levander> uksprout: webben's idea is a lot easier
[01:34] <dsdg> halo #ubuntu, can i install edgy 6.10 on a software raid level 1 at install level?
[01:35] <uksprout> ok new to this so can you explain how (just so I dont spen hours going round in circles)
[01:35] <levander> uksprout: after going into recovery mode, it's "passwd <user name>" to set the passwd
[01:35] <frogzoo> Atomiku: you need to add 'net/ipv4/ip_forward=1' to /etc/sysctl.conf
[01:35] <seldon> has anyone noticed that all screensavers in edgy pretty much now all run at 100% cpu? or is only my rig affected? i didnt have this problem in dapper.
[01:35] <Atomiku> frogzoo: Hmmm okay
[01:35] <Atomiku> I'll worry about that in a minute, anyway
[01:35] <frogzoo> Atomiku: to forward ports, use iptables
[01:35] <Atomiku> brb guys
[01:35] <Atomiku> frogzoo: Ill talk in a sec
[01:35] <uksprout> how do I get into recovery mode?   I didn't notice that during boot up ( I may have missed it though)
[01:35] <NullP01nt3r> frogzoo, thanks, do you know if I can setup loop encryption in a server that is already on production in a way that is transparent for the users?
[01:36] <seldon> yeah there is a recovery mode in bootup
[01:36] <webben> uksprout, there is a list that appears at bootup
[01:36] <seldon> NullP01nt3r, dont use loop - use cryptsetup
[01:36] <levander> uksprout: during bootup, there's a screen where you choose which kernel you want to boot, choose the top most one that says "Recovery mode" next to it.
[01:36] <webben> uksprout, you'll need to press a key (try an arrow key) to select a different mode
[01:36] <webben> uksprout, if you don't press any key, it loads in the default mode
[01:37] <seldon> NullP01nt3r,  there is an EncryptedFilesystemHowto in the forum section
[01:37] <sascha_> hello, I need some help... My notebook crashed yesterday and now I need a new one. Now I want to know if ubuntu works on the new apple notebooks with intel processor and I want to know if the hardware is supported...
[01:37] <webben> uksprout, (which is probably why you didn't notice it)
[01:37] <frogzoo> NullP01nt3r: don't think it can be done
[01:37] <uksprout> ok great now what happens if it is the username that actuall has the problem (as I said above I had to change it during the install)

[01:47] <Almindor> hello, is there a reason (technical) for not updating the nvidia driver package in edgy?
[01:48] <Almindor> I mean why the 9x isn't in yet
[01:48] <defrysk> Almindor, in a way yes
[01:48] <Almindor> bugged?
[01:48] <frogzoo> Almindor: that's just the ubuntu way of doing things
[01:48] <Almindor> not updating drivers?
[01:48] <frogzoo> Almindor: no, the issue is version control & supporot
[01:48] <defrysk> the packages are "frozen"
[01:48] <Almindor> but nobody depends on it
[01:48] <Almindor> there's no reason to freeze it
[01:49] <defrysk> nmeaning no new packages in edgy exept for security reasons
[01:49] <defrysk> Almindor, yes there is
[01:49] <uksprout> hi all sorted and into new system
[01:49] <Almindor> so basicly, if someone needs a new version a driver or kernel because of a driver, they are forced to not use ubuntu, or update into latest?
[01:49] <defrysk> main reason is that this setup is tested and stable
[01:49] <dsdg> this # is for complete idiots, my questions NEVER get answered, where does the clever people hang out..?
[01:50] <Hobbsee> Almindor: yes.  didnt you hear about X breaking for everyone, due to an update?
[01:50] <Almindor> yeah I was there
[01:50] <Almindor> shit happens
[01:50] <defrysk> so if you want lets say the latest driver for nvidia for edgy you need to get an external repo for the driver
[01:50] <Almindor> they should've tested before pushing to main but ok
[01:50] <Hobbsee> dsdg: better to put dapper on it - longer support
[01:50] <Almindor> hmm
[01:50] <Spee_Der> uksprout: WElcome back.
[01:50] <defrysk> Almindor, amaranth's repo has the latest nvidia-glx
[01:51] <Almindor> i'll google him, thanks
[01:51] <defrysk> yw
[01:51] <dsdg> Hobbsee, thank you, let me download - you think it will let me do a riad 1 during install?
[01:51] <shingalated> Is there a way to run a command (such as 'xtrlock') after my session has been idle for 5 mins?
[01:51] <Hobbsee> dsdg: last time i tried, it does.
[01:51] <teledyn> Almindor: i thought the nvidia driver was updated recently
[01:52] <Almindor> it's still 8x
[01:52] <uksprout> I'm just about to upddate my nvidia driver just caught the tail end of that conversation should I not do this?
[01:52] <teledyn> Almindor: so?
[01:52] <shingalated> anyone?
[01:52] <Almindor> teledyn, latest is 9x
[01:53] <teledyn> Almindor: if you want bleeding edge/unstable then install it yourself.  don't expect support
[01:53] <Almindor> teledyn, that's not bleeding edge
[01:53] <dsdg> Hobbsee, thank you dude,youre about the most help i got here, let me download and get back to you,
[01:53] <defrysk> and honestly 9x nvidia-driver has great features
[01:53] <Almindor> teledyn, it's a STABLE release from nvidia old 2 weeks now
[01:53] <Almindor> or more
[01:53] <teledyn> Almindor: 2 weeks old is not stable in distro terms
[01:54] <Almindor> what is? 6 months?
[01:54] <Spee_Der> shingalated: What is xtrlock ?
[01:54] <defrysk> Almindor, teledyn this is an off topic discussion
[01:54] <teledyn> Almindor: you don't understand how the distro development and testing processes work?
[01:55] <shingalated> speed_er, it is a minimalistic screen lock app.  I would use the regular one except it is giving me problems with beryl
[01:55] <Spee_Der> shingalated: Thanks, am not familir with that.
[01:55] <Spee_Der> But am looking anyway......

[02:34] <cbx33> but yes it is set up
[02:34] <cbx33> yes
[02:35] <banan> well, its on a test
[02:35] <cbx33> and I can access it on a linux machine
[02:35] <cbx33> just not fro ma windows machine
[02:36] <nanomike> cbx33, Ok, \\SERVERIP does not work? It asks for user/pass?
[02:36] <cbx33> yes
[02:36] <cbx33> asks for user pass
[02:36] <nanomike> cbx33, ok, one sec
[02:37] <cbx33> ok
[02:37] <jhgj> .
[02:38] <jsimmons> has anyone installed ubuntu on a system that uses a 8800GTX?
[02:39] <cbx33> nope but the new nvidia beta driver has support
[02:39] <cbx33> iirc
[02:39] <Innoruuk> Is there a way to get a shell script to always run and not displaying that run/display/cancel dialog?
[02:39] <nanomike> cbx33, in smb.conf you have security = share?
[02:39] <jsimmons> the installer says there's a problem with my xwindow config
[02:40] <eliphas_> join #lp5  hf
[02:40] <cbx33> nope
[02:40] <cbx33> all my security lines are commented out
[02:40] <cbx33> pete@edubuntu:/var/log/samba$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep security# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account;   security = user
[02:40] <cbx33> sorry cgiirc doesn't handle newlines well
[02:42] <lolo> i've got problems with my ati graphic card: i can't see the desktop, can anyone help me please?
[02:42] <cbx33> nanomike: I've had this working before....did I mention the windows machines are all on a DOMAIN
[02:43] <cbx33> i was hoping the shared folders tool would make it easy
[02:43] <nanomike> cbx33, You you want anyone to access the samba server without typing user/pass?
[02:43] <variant> lolo: move the graphics card out of the way, and clean your desk more regularly.. then you should be able to see it :)
[02:43] <cbx33> yes
[02:43] <cbx33> just read access
[02:43] <nanomike> cbx33, Yes and you have workgroup = YOUDOMAN?
[02:44] <cbx33> no
[02:44] <cbx33> I'll set that now
[02:44] <cbx33> ok have set that
[02:44] <cbx33> still no difference
[02:45] <shingalated> Spee_Der, any ideas on xtrlock yet?
[02:45] <nanomike> cbx33, Ok, in smb.conf under your share you have the right path? public = yes browsable = yes guest ok = yes?
[02:45] <cbx33> is it guest_ok?
[02:45] <cbx33> or guest ok
[02:45] <Spee_Der> shingalated: Sorry. No. I crashed and had to re-boot all three computers.....
[02:45] <nanomike> cbx33, guest ok = yes/no
[02:46] <shingalated> anyone else then? Is there a way to run a command (such as 'xtrlock') after my session has been idle for 5 mins?
[02:46] <lolo> variant very funny
[02:46] <cbx33> still asking for user/pass nanomike
[02:46] <nanomike> cbx33, you testparm to see if it reports any typos in smb.conf
[02:46] <nanomike> cbx33, Use
[02:46] <nanomike> cbx33, testparm    smbstatus
[02:47] <cbx33> ok
[02:47] <cbx33> have done
[02:47] <cbx33> passes
[02:47] <cbx33> and an IPC$ connection
[02:47] <cbx33> No locked files
[02:47] <constrictor> when you get a bash message that says "You have mail" how do you check it?
[02:47] <cbx33> type mail
[02:47] <nanomike> constrictor, mail
[02:48] <constrictor> nanomike: bash says mail command not found
[02:48] <cbx33> as I said nanomike it works fine if I'm a linux machine accessing it
[02:48] <cbx33> but just not fro ma windows machine
[02:48] <cbx33> grr
[02:49] <nanomike> cbx33, I see. you have the correct rights where the path = is pointing?
[02:49] <cbx33> yes
[02:50] <cbx33> all files are 5
[02:50] <cbx33> so R_X
[02:50] <cbx33> for all users
[02:50] <ayeizajedi> hi everyone, if you have an intel core duo processor, is there a particular kernel best suited for it ?
[02:50] <Tomcat_> constrictor: Package mailx... will install a mail server though... easiest is probably to make your mail client load the mails. :)
[02:51] <boink> any ubuntu kernel should be fine
[02:51] <nanomike> cbx33, Yeah. Then i don't know, sorry, but i'll think about it.
[02:51] <cbx33> ayeizajedi: the generic one should be fine
[02:51] <ayeizajedi> will that use both cores ?
[02:51] <boink> sure
[02:51] <boink> you can see that in "SMP"
[02:51] <Spee_Der> ayeizajedi: Yes there is. But you will have to search it up.
[02:51] <boink> otherise, you can compile your own kernel if you really want to make sure
[02:52] <boink> and there's a very handy debian way of doing that
[02:52] <Spee_Der> ayeizajedi: I think one of the SMP releases or versions is appropriate for that CPU.
[02:52] <ayeizajedi> ok everyone, thanks :)
[02:52] <defrysk> generic has smp support
[02:53] <Spee_Der> ayeizajedi: My compuer has four CPU's and it really likes the SMP version.
[02:53] <boink> generic has support for anything, almost
[02:53] <Spee_Der> Any flavor will do really.... But the SMP is much faster.
[02:53] <Spee_Der> !smp
[02:54] <boink> oh yeah :)
[02:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about smp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:54] <boink> heh
[02:55] <bigz> where does xchat install to, where about is the dir of it?
[02:55] <boink> bigz: try which xchat
[02:55] <bigz> cheers
[02:55] <boink> then you'll see where the binary is
[02:55] <atomikulinux> How can I get ubuntu to share the Internet connection?
[02:55] <boink> what type of internet connection?
[02:55] <MattJ> bigz: Config files are in ~/.xchat2
[02:56] <eexp16> bigz: unlike in windows, linux/unix programs do not install to one directory
[02:56] <MattJ> I think
[02:56] <boink> you mean like an internet connection?
[02:56] <boink> using the ubuntu box as a router?
[02:56] <atomikulinux> yeah
[02:56] <atomikulinux> basically
[02:56] <atomikulinux> it has two network cards
[02:56] <boink> using iptables
[02:56] <atomikulinux> yeah
[02:56] <atomikulinux> basically I followed this tutorial
[02:56] <atomikulinux> one sec
[02:56] <boink> don't paste!
[02:56] <Tomcat_> atomikulinux: Easiest is to install "arno-iptables-firewall" imho :)
[02:56] <boink> !pastebin
[02:56] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:56] <atomikulinux> Yeah
[02:56] <eexp16> bigz: xchat will install its binary to /usr/bin or /usr/X11/bin, its data files to /usr/lib/xchat and so on
[02:56] <atomikulinux> Some sort of software to do it for me
[02:57] <atomikulinux> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370 <--- i followed that
[02:57] <tijn_afk> !gtk+
[02:57] <boink> all you need to do is to setup the iptables to do the routing from your internal network to the outside interface
[02:57] <atomikulinux> it sorta worked
[02:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gtk+ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:57] <MattJ> atomikulinux: I found  a script
[02:57] <atomikulinux> Cool
[02:57] <bigz> well i script i just got for it, ask for it to be in ~/.xchat2
[02:57] <steven_> atomikulinux, very easy... 2 lines -> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o yourinternetinterface -j MASQUERADE, and the second: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[02:57] <MattJ> Not so sure it will work with 2 cards though
[02:57] <bigz> but i cant find it rofl
[02:57] <atomikulinux> hmmm
[02:57] <MattJ> Let me find the link...
[02:57] <steven_> that's it
[02:57] <boink> or look on google: iptables masquerading
[02:57] <atomikulinux> One minute
[02:57] <atomikulinux> ill just do what steven said
[02:57] <atomikulinux> btw
[02:57] <atomikulinux> ive already done something to the iptables
[02:58] <atomikulinux> so how do i take what i did out?
[02:58] <boink> iptables is a little trickey to setup the first time
[02:58] <MattJ> http://rob.pectol.com/content/view/2/1/
[02:58] <eexp16> bigz: that is the per-user config of xchat. it has nothing to do with the system-wide install dirs
[02:58] <MattJ> That script has support for easily setting up NAT
[02:58] <gop> hey any here know if thier a way to get gaim to look like ichat a theme of sorts?
[02:58] <atomikulinux> Ahhhh
[02:58] <atomikulinux> This ubuntu firewall thing
[02:58] <atomikulinux> seems like the thing i need cause it has port forwarding as well
[02:58] <atomikulinux> which i need X_X
[02:58] <tijn_afk> who can send me in a good direction about creating graphical frontends for python scripts?
[02:58] <eexp16> bigz: a diretory .xchat2 should exist in your home directory if you have run xchat at least once
[02:59] <MattJ> bigz: ~ means your home folder
[02:59] <BSDnux> i want to recursively zip a directory but exclude "hidden" directories (in my case .svn directories). my current code is "zip -0rj ../outpath/arch.jar ../inpath/content -x \.*" which excludes "hidden" files, but no dirs...
[02:59] <steven_> There's really no need whatsoever to look through a complicated script at all. It's very basis stuff. If you need extras like port forwarding then this might come in handy
[02:59] <bigz> its not there tho..
[02:59] <atomikulinux> argh im so stuck
[02:59] <steven_> *basic
[02:59] <atomikulinux> okay
[02:59] <constrictor> Thanks Tomcat_ mailx works
[02:59] <atomikulinux> I did this iptable thing already
=== tijn_afk is now known as tijn
[02:59] <MattJ> bigz: Are you using Terminal?
[02:59] <atomikulinux> how do i reverse what I did?
[02:59] <bigz> yups.
[02:59] <eexp16> bigz: keep in mind that unix system strictly separate system files and user files
[03:00] <atomikulinux> where is this iptable file?
[03:00] <gop> !ichat
[03:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ichat - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:00] <steven_> atomikulinux, you take the line, and you change this -A with -D
[03:00] <MattJ> bigz: cd ~/.xchat2
[03:00] <steven_> atomikulinux, that deletes the line
[03:00] <atomikulinux> ahh okay
[03:00] <atomikulinux> thanks
[03:00] <MattJ> bigz: That doesn't work?
[03:00] <bigz> gimme a sec
[03:00] <atomikulinux> So...
[03:00] <atomikulinux> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370
[03:00] <noika> !games
[03:00] <ubotu> Information about games on Ubuntu can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games and http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and ubuntugames.org
[03:00] <atomikulinux> So first I "ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1"
[03:00] <patrick_king> flyingsquirrel32: it worked i can get internet and files from the windows 2003 server
[03:01] <bigz> MattJ, cheers mate worked.. i feel so dumb now lol
[03:01] <MattJ> bigz: No problem :)
[03:01] <MattJ> bigz: Files/folders starting with a dot are automatically hidden
[03:01] <MattJ> bigz: But they are there
[03:01] <patrick_king> exit
[03:02] <bigz> lol okay MattJ it was just getting annyoing cos in xchat i could see it and when i went to find it, i could'nt.
[03:02] <eexp16> bigz: you want to learn how to use the shell. but i guess the gnome file manager also has a setting for displaying files/dirs beginning with a dot
[03:03] <atomikulinux> okay so ive just done "iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE"
[03:03] <boink> kewl
[03:04] <atomikulinux> Hmmm
[03:04] <boink> make that into a script now
[03:04] <atomikulinux> "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
[03:04] <atomikulinux> I think I already did that too
[03:04] <atomikulinux> btw
[03:04] <atomikulinux> is this gonna save?
[03:04] <boink> can you ping to the outside?
[03:04] <atomikulinux> I did this 10 minutes ago and when I rebooted
[03:04] <boink> sure, it's saved already
[03:04] <steven_> nope, you should put this into a script
[03:04] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:04] <atomikulinux> hmmm
[03:04] <boink> well .. if you want to reboot, you'll need to put it into rc.2
[03:04] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:04] <boink> so it's switched on automagically at boot time
[03:04] <atomikulinux> What I did was: "apt-get install dnsmasq ipmasq"
[03:05] <atomikulinux> do I need those?
[03:05] <atomikulinux>  5. Reconfigure ipmasq to start after networking has been started:
[03:05] <atomikulinux>     # dpkg-reconfigure ipmasq
[03:05] <atomikulinux> all I just remove those packages?
[03:05] <steven_> best is to create a script in /etc/init.d/ and go to /etc/rcS.d and add a symlink like S99firewall that points to this script. The script should be executable of course
[03:05] <atomikulinux> *shall
[03:05] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[03:05] <boink> also: man update-rc.d
[03:06] <boink> with update-rc.d you can make the softlinks needed
[03:06] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:07] <atomikulinux> okay so ive created a new file called "ICS" inside it is the iptables command and the echo command
[03:08] <atomikulinux> Shall I also put "ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1"
[03:08] <steven_> no
[03:08] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:08] <atomikulinux> So uhh now what
[03:08] <steven_> edit /etc/network/interfaces. And read "man interfaces".
[03:09] <atomikulinux> uhhhh
[03:10] <steven_> atomikulinux, if you ran the commands, the only thing left to do is set the other computers to use 192.168.0.1 as the gateway. These computers have to be in the same subnet (starting with 192.168.0.x)
[03:10] <atomikulinux> yeah
[03:10] <atomikulinux> I noticed that they werent asigned any IPs by DCHP
[03:10] <atomikulinux> any way
[03:10] <Odes> anyone know why my sound is extremly low in ubuntu 6.10?
[03:10] <uksprout> hi what is the default root password after install?
[03:10] <theplatypus> How do I add a storage partition to an existing installation?
[03:11] <sc4ttrbrain> help me.anyone, xmms error,please look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/   ?
[03:12] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms couldnt load
[03:12] <atomikulinux> okay
[03:13] <atomikulinux> how was it I made a script automatically load on startup again?
[03:13] <atomikulinux> I have my "ICS" script all ready
[03:13] <theplatypus> uksprout: Ubuntu doesn't use a root password use sudo instead
[03:13] <uksprout> it's ok I mssed out the sudo!!!
[03:13] <sc4ttrbrain> help me.anyone, xmms error,please look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/   ?
[03:14] <steven_> make sure line 1 in the script looks like this -> #!/bin/sh then do chmod +x ICS, and put it in /etc/init.d
[03:14] <sc4ttrbrain> xmms couldnt load
[03:14] <steven_> atomikulinux, then go to /etc/rcS.d and type: "ln -sf /etc/init.d/ICS S99ICS" and you're done
[03:15] <theplatypus> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/
[03:15] <steven_> I believe this is all documented though :)
[03:15] <sc4ttrbrain> help me.anyone, xmms error,please look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/   ?
[03:15] <nowimproved> how do i change the screen resolution?
[03:15] <atomikulinux> okay cool
[03:15] <atomikulinux> so my final ICS file looks like: "#!/bin/sh then do chmod +x ICS
[03:15] <atomikulinux> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
[03:15] <atomikulinux> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
[03:15] <Paragawadhiya> well goto system->preferances->screen resolution
[03:15] <steven_> no dude :)
[03:15] <shingalated> system>prefrences>screen resolution
[03:15] <Paragawadhiya> haha
[03:16] <atomikulinux> no?
[03:16] <atomikulinux> no to who
[03:16] <nowimproved> it wont let me go past a certain resolotion
[03:16] <nowimproved> i want 1280 x 1024
[03:16] <Odes> help me please, my sound is extremely low in ubuntu 6.10
[03:16] <theplatypus> then you need to specify that in xorg.conf
[03:16] <steven_> well all looks fine BUT with "then do" I meant after you edit it run this command: chmod +x ICS
[03:16] <shingalated> you might have to edit your xorg
[03:16] <shingalated> maybe yo are using the wrong driver
[03:16] <theplatypus> Odes run alsamixer
[03:16] <Odes> ok, and then
[03:17] <theplatypus> can anyone help with repartitioning an existing installation?
[03:17] <sc4ttrbrain> help me.anyone, xmms error,please look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33470/   ?
[03:17] <nowimproved> how do i install this rpm package?'
[03:17] <theplatypus> Odes,: it should be pretty self explanatory from there
[03:18] <Paragawadhiya> use alienx
[03:18] <Paragawadhiya> though not recommended
[03:18] <steven_> nowimproved, make sure the resolution is present in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:18] <muge2510> hi all
[03:18] <Odes> ok, but nothing is muted... no sound from the speakers but really low from headphones
[03:18] <boink> rpm? man alien
[03:18] <atomikulinux> okay cool, I have my symbolic link done
[03:19] <atomikulinux> I think its all done now!
[03:19] <boink> I had to use alien to install mysql-server-5.0 on edgy
[03:19] <atomikulinux> lemme go configure the windows computers
[03:19] <Paragawadhiya> gl man!
[03:19] <theplatypus> Odes: did you increase the master volume?
[03:19] <Odes> everything is 100/100
[03:20] <Odes> except IEC958
[03:20] <nowimproved> what is the location of the make program on here?
[03:20] <Odes> can't change that
[03:20] <MattJ> nowimproved: `which make` ?
[03:21] <steven_> and if not that: apt-get install build-essential but I could be wrong
[03:21] <nowimproved> i have to install it with apt get?
[03:21] <MattJ> Yep :)
[03:21] <theplatypus> Odes: right click on the sound icon located on the task bar then select "open volume control"
[03:21] <defrysk> nsudo apt-get install build-essential
[03:22] <defrysk> -n
[03:22] <Odes> alright
[03:22] <steven_> Always forget ubuntu uses the sudo thingy :)
[03:22] <nowimproved> where is the location of the gcc prograM
[03:23] <sysadmin> hi room
[03:23] <theplatypus> can anyone help with repartitioning an existing installation?
[03:23] <atomikulinux> by the way
[03:23] <steven_> If you don't know where an executable is: always run "which" with the name of the executable
[03:23] <steven_> this shows you the path
[03:23] <atomikulinux> does anybody know if theres a "unrealircd" apt-get package?
[03:23] <atomikulinux> or am i gonna have to install it all by myself :O
[03:23] <apophis> hello when i installed war tft on cedega and wine and wanna play it told me no cd found what can i do symlink and how?
[03:23] <Odes> everything is maxed out, should IEC958 be marked?
[03:23] <sysadmin> anybody knows abt ubuntu boot prmt options ?
[03:24] <steven_> atomikulinux, apt-cache search unreal or something and this might give you some package names.
[03:24] <atomikulinux> thanks :D
[03:24] <steven_> install the one that looks right
[03:24] <atomikulinux> lol what would I do without you guys
[03:24] <tijn> be idle? :)
[03:24] <atomikulinux> Probably XD
[03:24] <levander> Anybody got an easy way for keeping java updated?  I don't think java is in the Canonical repositories, and even if it were, I need to stay more up-to-date than Canonical does.
[03:25] <atomikulinux> Id be having lots of trouble with linux, thats for sure
[03:25] <lightup> Hi everyone, I've just started learning C++ and I've compiled my first program with no errors but I don't know how to get it to run?  Should it just open in a terminal?  Sorry if this is a massive noob question.
[03:25] <boink> everyone does, it's normal
[03:25] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot ?
[03:25] <boink> everyone has problems with windows too .. computers just sux
[03:26] <ataq> what program>?
[03:26] <levander> lightup: there's probably a program called a.out if you didn't specify a filename on the compiler command line
[03:26] <JDahl> lightup, execute from a terminal as "./prog"
[03:26] <lightup> aaah right the path thing my borther told me about that
[03:26] <levander> JDahl: is "prog" the default name for binaries produced by g++ these days?
[03:27] <nowimproved> what is the location of the c header files that match my kernel?
[03:27] <lightup> that worked thanks alot!  Now all I have to do is learn the language...
[03:27] <ataq> lightup: go to your source folder and look for a binary and open terminal in that folder and run the prog by ./programnamehere
[03:27] <steven_> nowimproved, if installed, probably /usr/src
[03:27] <levander> nowimproved: you may have to download the kernel source code package
[03:27] <atomikulinux> also
[03:27] <steven_> nowimproved, install the package: linux-headers-`uname -r`
[03:27] <atomikulinux> nvm
[03:27] <nowimproved> god i hate this
[03:28] <teledyn> nowimproved: used dpkg -L <package name> to list
[03:28] <levander> is there a more advanced ubuntu channel?
[03:28] <ataq> lightup: check out Anjuta, its a great C++ compiler program/ development
[03:28] <nowimproved> ubuntu is not advanced period
[03:28] <nowimproved> it sucks
[03:28] <frogzoo> nowimproved: that's a fairly categorical statement
[03:28] <levander> ataq: lightup elft
[03:28] <JDahl> levander, advanced in what sense?  there's #ubuntu-motu
[03:29] <Odes> i have two devices in volume control: HDA Intel (ALSA mixer) and Realtek ALC883 (OSS mixer)
[03:29] <levander> JDahl: advanced in the sense that people aren't al asking beginner questionss
[03:29] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot in ubuntu ?
[03:29] <levander> JDahl: I assume that channel you mention is for people participating in packaging for the repositories.
[03:30] <levander> JDahl: like, I wish they had an ubuntu-server channel, to get away from all these desktop questions
[03:30] <atomikulinux> whats the path to the openssl directory?
[03:30] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot in ubuntu ?
[03:30] <atomikulinux> is it "/usr/bin/openssl" ?
[03:30] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot in ubuntu ?
[03:30] <levander> atomikulinux: 'dpkg -L openssh-server' (i think that's the name of the package)
[03:31] <nowimproved> how do i get ride of all the ubuntu garbage at boot up
[03:31] <atomikulinux> hmm
[03:31] <nowimproved> and when x startx
[03:31] <levander> atomikulinux: 'dpkg -S <file name in package>' to find out package name
[03:31] <nowimproved> starts*
[03:31] <steven_> package is called "openssl" :)
[03:31] <atomikulinux> I believe its already installed
[03:31] <teledyn> atomikulinux: use the which command to locate paths of binaries in your path
[03:31] <atomikulinux> apt-get install openssl
[03:31] <atomikulinux> said it was already updated
[03:31] <atomikulinux> I did sudo updatedb then locate openssl
[03:31] <sysadmin> anybody ?
[03:31] <boink> and echo $PATH can show you your path
[03:31] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot in ubuntu ?
[03:31] <teledyn> nowimproved: what garbage?
[03:31] <atomikulinux> ive got a number of different directorys thatlook like it could be it
[03:31] <levander> atomikulinux: 'dpkg -L openssl' to see the files in the package
[03:32] <atomikulinux> Okay, cool :)
[03:32] <Spee_Der> wb uk
[03:32] <teledyn> sysadmin: i'm not sure, it might be FS related or maybe an entry in fstab
[03:32] <levander> atomikulinux: is there documentation in /usr/share or antyhign?  maybe read that
[03:32] <sysadmin> how do i do a forcefsck on boot in ubuntu ?
[03:32] <atomikulinux> still hasnt really helped
[03:32] <teledyn> sysadmin: stop repeating
[03:32] <atomikulinux> I have a number of different directorys
[03:32] <tobi1canobe> hello. does /proc/config.gz in standard ubuntu kernels?
[03:32] <atomikulinux> I'll just try: "/etc/ssl"
[03:32] <ataq> sysadmin: google is your friend
[03:32] <nowimproved> all the big ubuntu animation garbage
[03:32] <uksprout> Spee_der: still no joy on TV output
[03:32] <sysadmin> i want an answer
[03:33] <ataq> tough
[03:33] <levander> sysadmin: if somebody knew, they'd have told you
[03:33] <nowimproved> no what i mean?
[03:33] <uksprout> Spee_der: I can't find an option to tell the system I habe more than one screen attched
[03:33] <teledyn> nowimproved: get rid of the splash option in your boot loader config, or edit it manually in the bootloader menu at boot
[03:33] <levander> sysadmin: actually, try booting into recovery mode, then run fsck?
[03:33] <levander> uksprout: i think that would be in the graphics card driver
[03:34] <levander> uksprout: see the doc's for your graphics card driver
[03:34] <atomikulinux> Ahhh
[03:34] <tobi1canobe> sysadmin: fedora here, but it's probably the same on ubuntu. tune2fs -c 30 /dev/hda1 ; tune2fs -C 30 /dev/hda1
[03:34] <atomikulinux> I know what I need
[03:34] <uksprout> levander: how do I get at it though?
[03:34] <atomikulinux> the SSL development files! :P
[03:34] <atomikulinux> duhh
[03:34] <levander> uksprout: what video card are you using?
[03:34] <tobi1canobe> sysadmin: will force an fsck on every 30th mount
[03:34] <uksprout> GeForce FX 5200
[03:35] <ataq> i think its set to auto check 30 times anyways?
[03:35] <sysadmin> i tried forcefsck
[03:35] <ataq> worked?
[03:35] <sysadmin> it wont work
[03:35] <uksprout> levander: went through what and how to install but I cannot find anything like docs or a utility on the system
[03:35] <niksavel> hey all...  can anyone help me, I want to make a shell script to put in my cron.hourly to start ktorrent as user niksavel (not as root,...)
[03:35] <nowimproved> how do i control what starts?
[03:35] <nowimproved> there is no xinit
[03:35] <nowimproved> rc
[03:35] <ataq> check out ubuntu forums, maybe someone had this problem before, or google
[03:36] <sysadmin> it works in fc
[03:36] <teledyn> niksavel: su to that user in the script
[03:36] <teledyn> nowimproved: in the settings manager
[03:36] <niksavel> teldyn: please explain more :)  don't understand what you mean
[03:36] <nowimproved> what a crap hole
[03:36] <niksavel> teledyn: please explain more :)  don't understand what you mean
[03:37] <teledyn> nowimproved: if you startx manually you can create a ~/.xsession
[03:37] <teledyn> niksavel: use su
[03:37] <nowimproved> where is the settings?
[03:37] <ozoneco> morning....i installed a program via pkg manager, how do i find where it went?
[03:37] <levander> /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-driver-nv - that's the documentation directory
[03:37] <teledyn> nowimproved: should be in your menu
[03:37] <ataq> Anyone successfully get Xgl workin in Edgy?
[03:37] <levander> uksprout: you see just above?
[03:37] <niksavel> teledyn: but I DONT want it to start as root, just as a regular user
[03:37] <teledyn> niksavel: what?
[03:37] <nowimproved> what is it called?
[03:38] <teledyn> nowimproved: i don't know i rarely use that feature.  you can read about sys v init also
[03:38] <niksavel> teledyn: how to tell linux to run any command (i.e. ktorrent) as a certain user (i.e. niksavel)
[03:38] <levander> uksprout: 'apt-cache search nv | grep -i driver' to find the package name, then 'dpkg -L <package name>' to see the files in the package, based on the file names, you can guess what the files are - that's how I found it.
[03:38] <nowimproved> no thanks
[03:38] <teledyn> niksavel: i told you - use su
[03:38] <ozoneco> nm
[03:38] <HCand> hello.. i'm totally new to Ubuntu/linux, and i have a question about screen resolutions.. would anyone help me?
[03:38] <levander> uksprout: oh wait, there's nothing in that damn doc directory
[03:39] <MattJ> ozoneco: What package?
[03:39] <steven_> nowimproved, very simple use su niksavel -c yourcommand
[03:39] <ataq> Hcand: I'll help you if I can
[03:39] <ozoneco> MattJ: found the history is listed right on the item itself, thanks....and fgfs was the pkg
[03:40] <eexp16> niksavel: AFAIK you can't use cron to start gui programs. programs started by cron will not even have output on the text console.
[03:40] <levander> uksprout: look at the nvidia-settings package - i found it by using 'apt-cache search' again
[03:40] <MattJ> Ok, no problem :)
[03:40] <dale> hi! Can someone give me a little help?
[03:40] <ataq> dale: whats up#?
[03:40] <levander> You guys, don't ask to ask, just ask.
[03:40] <teledyn> eexp16: actually i think you can always start a gui program from a shell script
[03:40] <arepie> i've add another 512mb ram to my pc.. and suddenly.. my 3d effect + my aiglx driver is not working
[03:40] <niksavel> eexpl4: any other way that I can make my comp check if ktorrent and amule are active and start them?
[03:41] <dale> ataq, I've got a problem:when I log out of gnome I can't get back in w/o a reboot
[03:41] <levander> teledyn: yes, you can, as long as the gui program can find an X server to attach to.
[03:41] <teledyn> levander: yeah just specify the DISPLAY to it
[03:41] <eexp16> teledyn: but that shell script won't have display rights on the running X server
[03:41] <ataq> dale: does it go text screen?
[03:41] <nowimproved> damn what a shithoole
[03:41] <teledyn> eexp16: just use xhost + to allow it
[03:42] <levander> arepie: you've tried reconfiguring your graphics card? that's my only guess
[03:42] <dale> ataq, no and I can log into other window managers, but not gnome
[03:42] <eexp16> teledyn: using xhost + is a major security hole
[03:42] <arepie> levander: i didn't changed anything to my xorg.conf..
[03:42] <ataq> dale: try deleting gnome config file and that will reset original settings to gnome
[03:42] <HCand> how can i make 1600x1200 accesible under screen resolution, if i didnt point it out in the installation
[03:42] <teledyn> eexp16: xhost + localhost  i mean
[03:43] <dale> ataq, ok where's it located?
[03:43] <bSON> after i updated to the current feisty development version ("current" is the one from yesterday) I have the problem that there is no /dev/input/mice anymore and thus the X server can't be started. also, there's no /dev/eth0 anymore... what's oing on?
[03:43] <uksprout> levander: The Display Device Help page is a place holder until support for configuring TwinView is added. lol!
[03:43] <eexp16> niksavel: why monitor them anyway? do they crash that often?
[03:43] <ataq> dale: /home/user/.gnome
[03:43] <steven_> HCand, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for the other resolutions there. Add the one you need
[03:43] <ataq> HCand: you use ubuntu ya?
[03:43] <niksavel> eexpl6: I have a problem with moblock
[03:43] <eexp16> teledyn: well, still a security issue. other local users can use the X display too.
[03:43] <levander> uksprout: maybe that's just TwinView in the nvidia-settings utility, i'm pretty sure nVidia supports TwinView on linux
[03:43] <dale> ataq, I've deleted the whole .gnome director and .gnome2 and it still doesn't work
[03:43] <teledyn> niksavel: make a little script that checks if they're running with ps, then sleeps a while, and repeats
[03:43] <steven_> or dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:43] <niksavel> eexpl6: so I am editing it's updating script to have it RESTART instead of reload
[03:44] <ataq> dale: try restarting there
[03:44] <levander> arepie: well, anytime something breaks, just try reconfiguring it, try reconfiguring your graphcis card if it's broken
[03:44] <eexp16> niksavel: ...whatever moblock is
[03:44] <niksavel> eexpl6: alternative to peerguardian
[03:44] <dale> ataq, thanks! I'll give it a try
[03:44] <uksprout> levander: Yes it does but it is just getting at the option in Ubuntu that is my problem
[03:44] <niksavel> eexpl6: blocks various IPs
[03:44] <ataq> dale: anytime
[03:44] <niksavel> eexpl6: but I can't have ktorrent and amule up while moblock is offline
[03:44] <eexp16> niksavel: sorry, i dont do any of this peer2peer things
[03:44] <niksavel> eexpl6: it's just an addon to firewall... it's not really the problem here
[03:44] <sascha_> hello, I need some help... My notebook crashed yesterday and now I need a new one. Now I want to know if ubuntu works on the new apple notebooks with intel processor and I want to know if the hardware is supported...
[03:44] <levander> uksprout: oh, i must have changed my google search terms a little this time: http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8774/README/index.html
[03:45] <levander> uksprout: search that page for "twinview" - that's the driver readme
[03:45] <niksavel> eexpl6: I just want to make a script that will load ktorrent and amule if they are not active
[03:45] <dale> ataq the only thing in .gnome is a dir. gnome-vfs
[03:45] <ataq> sascha: I dont think it does. not 100% certain. try google
[03:45] <levander> uksprout: no idea why Ubuntu doesn't install that when they install the driver, maybe file a bug that it's not in there in Launchpad?
[03:45] <ataq> dale: the gnome config is stored there
[03:45] <uksprout> levander: wonderful thanks so much this is driving me mad
[03:45] <niksavel> eexpl6: I thought it would be okay to just make a text file with ktorrent and amule commands...  since they both check if they are already running - I want have duplicate processes
[03:45] <dale> ataq: ok
[03:46] <uksprout> levander: uh! launchpad is the the menu system?
[03:46] <teledyn> ataq: ru serious it wouldn't run on an intel mac?  isn't it just the same as any other intel notebook?
[03:46] <levander> uksprout: to repay the favor, put that that README is not installed with the driver by Ubuntu in launchpad, that README should be in there
[03:46] <eexp16> niksavel: so write a script with an endless while-loop checking if the processes exist and start them if not
[03:46] <niksavel> eexpl6: but I assume that every script I put into cron.hourly is launching commands as a super user - and both ktorrent and amule rebel against being run as root
=== lupastro is now known as a
[03:46] <dale> ataq: so I just remove the gnome-vfs directory?
=== a is now known as lupo
[03:46] <ataq> teledyn: its Intel CPU, PPC arch (I think)
[03:47] <niksavel> eexpl6: this is my first attempt at making a script :)
[03:47] <uksprout> levander: how do I get to launchpad?
[03:47] <niksavel> eexpl6: don't reallly know a lot
[03:47] <eexp16> niksavel: like i said before, cron is not meant to run any gui programs
[03:47] <sjoerd> ataq: if it's an intell cpu it's not a ppc arch
[03:47] <ataq> dale: just delete the whole .gnome dir to reset
[03:47] <teledyn> ataq: i think intel and ppc are separate arches
[03:47] <lupo> sorry link for download ubuntu new version ?
[03:47] <dale> ataq: okay thanks
[03:47] <kanzie> I tried to install the latest release ny downloading the ISO and burn it in Windows. I start the system up and get to the initial menu, but no matter which option I choose it just says Loading on top of the screen. I have waited 30 minutes wihtou no result
[03:47] <levander> uksprout: launchpad.net - the web site is a little complex, i always have to look around and read things to figure out what is what
[03:47] <niksavel> eexpl6: is there any alternative solution? :)
[03:47] <kanzie> the memtest does work
[03:47] <eexp16> niksavel: programs run by cron don't even have a controlling terminal
[03:47] <kanzie> though
[03:48] <ataq> sjoerd: I am not sure, but, I was told its not possible to install linux PPC on the intel ones yet
[03:48] <Healot> ppc - PowerPC proc, for Intel Mac? you can use the regular 32-bit; with some difficulty handling the boot loader though
[03:48] <uksprout> levander: ah ok.... I have to thank you again if that is a tech info site!
[03:48] <sjoerd> ataq: Intel mac is just a normal intel machine
[03:48] <teledyn> ataq: you would not install a ppc version on an intel system ever
[03:48] <kanzie> Ive tried on two different laptops of the same make, with the same result
[03:48] <ataq> sjoerd: really? shit!
[03:49] <sjoerd> ataq: only the use EFI instead of a ``normall'' bios
[03:49] <teledyn> kanzie: maybe a bad CD?  or a bad ISO?  did you md5sum it?
[03:49] <kanzie> ataq: you kind of missed that big news when they announced the news of Intel Macs =)
[03:49] <kanzie> no
[03:49] <eexp16> niksavel: put the loop with the sleep command in the monitoring script and run that script as part of your X session when logging in
[03:49] <kanzie> teledyn: no I have not md5 it
[03:49] <niksavel> eexpl6: than I'm stumped.. thought I could do this via cron
[03:49] <ataq> kanzie: Ya I can see that lol
[03:49] <niksavel> eexpl6: lol...   I understood only half of that :)
[03:49] <levander>  uksprout: it's not a tech info site, (well, not one like slashdot) - it records the status of various things for projects like ubuntu.  Status are things like bug reports that can be entered by users.  The Ubuntu developers do use Launchpad themselves.  Launcpad was developed by Canonical.
[03:49] <niksavel> eexpl6: I'm quite new to linux entirely
[03:50] <teledyn> kanzie: yeah it was in all the papers  :-)
[03:50] <eexp16> niksavel: you have to be familiar with shell scripting
[03:50] <niksavel> eexpl6: any howtos or examples somewhere?
[03:50] <niksavel> eexpl6: as I said, this is the first time I attempted such a thing
[03:50] <teledyn> niksavel: try asking in #bash
[03:50] <eexp16> niksavel: hold on
[03:50] <atomikulinux> okay guyas
[03:50] <atomikulinux> just gonna reboot
[03:50] <ataq> kanzie: Last week I rang apple, and asked could I install tiger on X86 and they said no? I thought then there was a difference
[03:50] <atomikulinux> lets hope this script n stuff will work
[03:50] <atomikulinux> brb
[03:51] <dale> atak: I tried deleting the .gnome directory and gnome still won't load.. hangs on blue screen
[03:51] <teledyn> ataq: yeah you can't install their stuff on other boxes, but can install other stuff on their boxes.  they're control freaks.
[03:51] <kanzie> ataq: Just as the people here have explained, technically they dont want you to run OSX on non-macs
[03:51] <ataq> dale: Not sure tbh, check ubuntu forums. sorry
[03:52] <PurpleMonkey> help help. how come every few minus, my fire fox cannot log into the internet? and notice the DNS reset itself automatic?
[03:52] <kanzie> is there any default tools for md5-checking in a default ubuntu Dapper install?
[03:52] <ataq> That sucks, Apple sucks
[03:52] <kanzie> md5sum right?
[03:52] <levander> teledyn: Apple makes their money selling hardware, not as much selling software.  They don't want you taking their (relatively) cheap software and putting it on somebody else's cheap hardware.  That's why they do that.
[03:52] <teledyn> md5sum
[03:52] <dale> ataq: thanks for your help, I think it might be related to network-manager, but I'm not sure
[03:53] <ataq> dale: why do you think network-manager?
[03:53] <ubuntu> hii
[03:53] <kanzie> teledyn: How do I use it to confirm the iso-file?
[03:53] <kanzie> md5sum -c iso does all files in the image
[03:53] <PurpleMonkey> How to prevent DNS from reseting?
[03:53] <levander> LjL: what is with change the mode to the same thing a hundred times?
[03:53] <dale> ataq: I changed it to gnome-network-manager and its been weird since, different crashes
[03:53] <justin_> Is there any programs for Ubuntu/Linux that can play MP3's in console *but* with a playlist?
[03:54] <sjoerd> justin_: mp3blaster used to be nice
[03:54] <dale> ataq: one other question? how do I get color in the console w/o being in X?
[03:54] <LadyNikon> doesnt xmms have a console version?
[03:54] <ataq> dale: thats actually a strange problem
=== _ChaKy_ is now known as ChaKy
[03:54] <ataq> dale: Your in text mode ya? no X?
[03:55] <justin_> sjoerd: Why do you say "used"? what changed?
[03:55] <LjL> levander: ?
[03:55] <sjoerd> justin_: last time i used it was 4 years ago or so :)
[03:55] <sjoerd> justin_: it's probably still nice
[03:55] <justin_> sjoerd: Ahh :P
[03:55] <dale> ataq: yes, when I hit ca f1 and log in
[03:55] <kanzie> how do I md5-check my .iso-file?
[03:55] <ataq> dale: I dont understand. explain where your at and what you want to do exactly
[03:56] <dale> ataq: I'm in X now, just in XFCE
[03:56] <niksavel> one more question with scrpting - is there a command to delay executing i.e. a pause or wait or something for a minute or so?
[03:56] <ataq> dale: XFCE is better, lighter
[03:56] <eexp16> niksavel: look here: http://84.179.125.158:28051/
[03:57] <Spee_Der> uksprout: How's it going so far ?
[03:57] <dale> ataq: when I log out of X and log into a console [alt,ctl f1-f6]  I don't have color when I enter ls -al
[03:58] <justin_> I downloaded Cmus, let's see if its any good :) --- but that is something that should be included in the Ubuntu install, a nice console MP3 player.. should not add much to bloat either since they are tiny :)
[03:58] <kanzie> what should I use to erase my CD-RW and burn the ubuntu-iso to it in ubuntu?
[03:58] <niksavel> thanks!
[03:58] <ataq> dale: it doesnt really matter
[03:58] <apokryphos> !burn
[03:58] <ubotu> CD/DVD Burning software: K3b (KDE), gnomebaker, serpentine, graveman Nautilus cd burner (Gnome), gtoaster, xcdroast, cdrecord (terminal-based). Burning .iso files: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[03:58] <LjL> kanzie: cdrecord blank=all, i think
[03:58] <Daviey> kanzie, right click, burn to cd?
[03:58] <teledyn> kanzie: you need to download the md5sum, then run md5sum on the .iso and compare the value
[03:58] <kanzie> Daviey: nope
[03:58] <uksprout> Spee_Der: just made the changes to xorg.conf..... in the last distro I had I could now drop to a cli issue an init 3 cp my new xorg over the old then issu an init 5 how do I do that in ubuntu
[03:58] <dale> ataq: ok
[03:58] <eexp16> niksavel: you have to modify the sleep time and the APP name
[03:58] <apokryphos> kanzie: check what ubotu said
[03:58] <justin_> kanzie: In windows?.. anything --- in Ubuntu.. I like Xfburn for Iso's -- simple and does great work.
[03:58] <Daviey> kanzie, okay "write to disc"
[03:59] <uksprout> *init 5= init 6 (reboot
[03:59] <Spee_Der> uksprout: That I don't know. Am just glad to see you made it back here.... phew !
[03:59] <dale> ataq: I'll post the gnome problem on the forums.  bye'
[03:59] <uksprout> Spee_Der: lol
[04:00] <ColiFato> hi all.. i have the ubuntu 6.06 cd and i need to make an "server installation" wich are the steps to do?
[04:00] <uksprout> ok anyone how to I exit gnome and drop to a cli and then reboot
[04:00] <justin_> Oh yeah, for anyone who is looking for a console MP3 player -- Cmus is hot :D
[04:00] <Daviey> ctrl+alt+F1
[04:00] <Daviey> uksprout,
[04:00] <uksprout> yes but that leaves gnome running doesn't it?
[04:00] <Daviey> uksprout, yes
[04:01] <uksprout> is that a problem if I am cping a new xorg.conf?
[04:01] <teledyn> uksprout: ctrl-alt-F1 then /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[04:01] <atomikulinux> hmmm
[04:01] <atomikulinux> who was it who was helping me earlier?
[04:01] <uksprout> teledyn: many thanks
[04:01] <atomikulinux> because it doesnt seem to be worknig
[04:01] <eexp16> justin_: mp3blaster is also nice
[04:02] <teledyn> uksprout: that will prevent it from respawing, but i don't know if it will kill the existing gnome session.
[04:02] <deusjevoo> on a 64bit cpu, install a 64bit version? or too much problems?
[04:03] <Healot> depends on how much you know; deusjevoo
[04:03] <bSON> did someone recognize my question?
[04:03] <deusjevoo> a lot
[04:03] <atomikulinux> Okay
[04:03] <deusjevoo> but not from linux
[04:03] <xopher> deusjevoo, Im actually getting over most of the problems, got flash working yesterday, and the new mplayer plays wmv9 videos so..
[04:03] <atomikulinux> So how can I get this stuff working
[04:03] <justin_> eexp16: Could be, I think i'll try it later on though.. Cmus seems to be doing exactly what I want.. Im not sure if it can stream radio shows though.. hrmmm we'll see
[04:03] <atomikulinux> I wanna have ubuntu share the internet
[04:03] <xopher> But deusjevoo Id go with i386 for now
[04:03] <deusjevoo> ok, thanks
[04:04] <justin_> xopher: .. yeah
[04:04] <xopher> have fun 
[04:04] <teledyn> atomikulinux: just set up ip masquerading nat with iptables
[04:04] <justin_> How come Mplayer as advanced as it is.. has no option to "repeat" videos forever? haha.. I mean that is standard on like almost every video player..
[04:04] <atomikulinux> yeah
[04:04] <atomikulinux> thats what I have done
[04:04] <deusjevoo> there's also those alternate versions
[04:04] <eexp16> justin_: another one is mpd. not exactly a console player, but a player daemon with playlists and all, which has console and gui clients.
[04:04] <bSON> i repeat: after i updated to the current feisty development version ("current" is the one from yesterday) I have the problem that there is no /dev/input/mice anymore and thus the X server can't be started. also, there's no /dev/eth0 anymore... what's oing on?
[04:04] <Healot> deusjevoo: do you know how to pimp?
[04:05] <deusjevoo> even don't know what pimp is
[04:05] <teledyn> bSON: this is the wrong channel for feisty support
[04:05] <deusjevoo> hope you gonna tell me
[04:05] <justin_> Healot: I do!
[04:05] <bSON> teledyn: should i go to ubuntu-decel?
[04:05] <bSON> devel
[04:05] <Healot> then use the 32-bit version...
[04:05] <justin_> <-- Pimp supreme.
[04:05] <teledyn> bSON: maybe ask in ubuntu+1 channel
[04:05] <Healot> hehe just checking on how much you know
[04:05] <bSON> teledyn: ok thanks
[04:06] <atomikulinux> hmm
[04:06] <atomikulinux> its not resolving anythign now
[04:06] <atomikulinux> im connected to this irc
[04:06] <atomikulinux> but cant connect to anythign else now
[04:06] <ColiFato> i have the ubuntu 6.06 cd and i need to make an "server installation" or text mode only..  wich are the steps to do?
[04:06] <atomikulinux> its unstable >_<
[04:08] <feross> anyone running fvwm-cyrstal? know how to get to the Crystal menu if you select 'clear' or 'dock' recepies where there is no menu on the screen? is the a shortcut key to pop it up or what..

[04:10] <grem_> hi
[04:10] <teledyn> atomikulinux: find a tutorial on how to set it up properly
[04:10] <atomikulinux> I think I just need to start again
[04:10] <atomikulinux> Ive foudn tutorials
[04:11] <LjL> deusjevoo: depends on your needs. LTS has the benefit of, well, LTS
[04:11] <atomikulinux> its just screwed everything up
[04:11] <LjL> !enter | atomikulinux
[04:11] <ubotu> atomikulinux: Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[04:11] <atomikulinux> okay sorry
[04:11] <afflux> morgen.

[04:11] <atomikulinux> I have a habbit of doing that
[04:11] <atomikulinux> teledyn: yes
[04:11] <deusjevoo> but beeing debian based, can allways update, not?
[04:11] <afflux> sry LjL, was a amsg. wont happen again.
[04:11] <Spee_Der> afflux: Good morning.
[04:12] <atomikulinux> I think I just need to start all again.
[04:12] <grem_> whats the 'nice' way to install external software in Linux/Ubuntu? say I got this game that comes in a zip. should I install it in my home or /opt, or what?
[04:12] <teledyn> atomikulinux: you need to understand the fundamental network building blocks and what tools to use
[04:12] <atomikulinux> I have my two ethernet cards. eth0 which goes to the network and eth1 to the modem
[04:12] <LjL> grem_: /opt or /usr/local
[04:12] <teledyn> atomikulinux: take one step at a time in order, and check each one
[04:13] <teledyn> atomikulinux: internal and ext ifaces
[04:13] <atomikulinux> teledyn:  that isnt making any sense
[04:13] <deusjevoo> LjL: but beeing debian based, can allways update, not?
[04:13] <atomikulinux> At the moment eth0 is disabled, because when I enable it the internet stops working
[04:13] <LjL> deusjevoo: should be able to
[04:13] <teledyn> atomikulinux: internal and external interfaces
[04:13] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell deusjevoo about upgrade | deusjevoo, you have a private message from Ubotu
[04:13] <teledyn> atomikulinux: use the correct terminology
[04:13] <grem_> LjL, and I'll have no problems with permissions or whatever? Or should I just 'sudo' every app
[04:13] <atomikulinux> well you seem to understand what I mean
[04:14] <teledyn> atomikulinux: i don't know which one is your eth1 and eth0, so use ext and int
[04:14] <LjL> grem_, there's no reason why you should have permission problems *because of* putting them in /opt or /usr/local. but of course, if they don't have the right permissions set, you won't be able to start them (and no, using sudo is not a good idea)
[04:15] <Keyseir> I'm getting a core dump when I try to use apt-get or open certain programs: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33475/ Please help, I don't know where to start looking for my problem.
[04:15] <LjL> grem_, programs should normally be owned by root:root and have +x set for everyone
[04:15] <LjL> !automatix | Keyseir ;)
[04:15] <ubotu> Keyseir ;): automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[04:16] <grem_> tks alot LjL  :)
[04:16] <teledyn> Keyseir: strace it
[04:16] <LjL> Keyseir: by the way, the browser is called "epiphany-browser", "epiphany" is a game
[04:16] <eexp16> atomikulinux: i guess you set a default route in eth0's config, so if you enable eth0 the original default route (over eth1) is replaced. configure eth0 without the gateway setting.
[04:16] <Keyseir> LjL, I haven't used automatix for weeks. Does it seem likely this is the kind of error automatix propogates? I didn't use it to install any of the offending applications.
[04:16] <teledyn> Keyseir: something like strace -s 128 -o /tmp/strace.out -f apt-get update
[04:17] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[04:17] <atomikulinux> Something just isnt right
[04:17] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[04:17] <LjL> Keyseir, it can be - you have the automatix repo in your sources.list, so it can do interesting new things every time you update your system
[04:17] <ColiFato> i have the ubuntu 6.06 cd and i need to make an "server installation" or text mode only..  wich are the steps that i need do?
[04:17] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> argh
[04:17] <atomikulinux> Well I dont think the internet is set properly set up for linux
[04:18] <LjL> Keyseir, what's your version of libc6? apt-cache policy libc6
[04:18] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> automatix >.<
[04:18] <atomikulinux> I have my cable modem plugged into the linux box through an ethernet card (eth1)
[04:18] <Keyseir> LjL, 2.4-1ubuntu12 0
[04:18] <eexp16> atomikulinux: and what is the config for eth0?
[04:18] <atomikulinux> eexp16: default
[04:18] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: pppe or just dhcp?
[04:18] <atomikulinux> DHCP
[04:19] <atomikulinux> when I go into network tools
[04:19] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: check settings in /etc/network/interfaces
[04:19] <atomikulinux> My IP and stuff is fine
[04:19] <LjL> Keyseir: that's the right version. anyway, this means that apt-cache policy works without segfaulting, right? have you found other programs that segfault besides apt-get and firefox?
[04:19] <gimmulf> What port runs ssh on default??
[04:19] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: so what's the prob?
[04:19] <eexp16> atomikulinux: yeah, forget the gui tools, /etc/network/interfaces will tell you the truth
[04:19] <Hinata_sama|iBoo> 22
[04:19] <frogzoo> gimmulf: grep ssh /etc/services
[04:19] <LjL> gimmulf: ca
[04:19] <atomikulinux> eexp16: I have a few things in there, lemme put em on a pastebin
[04:20] <atomikulinux> oh wait, i cant
[04:20] <atomikulinux> nothing is resolving any more
[04:20] <chinny> hi. I'm looking to be able to use 2 monitors on an edgy box. I've unfortunately got an ATI card (X300) so from what I've read either Xinerama or ATI Big-Desktop are the two option open to me. I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations?
[04:20] <Keyseir> LjL, yes, evidently that worked. Aptitude segfaults, and I'm going to try a few programs... I'm removing automatix stuff from the list
[04:20] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: if you're getting an ip ok, dhcp's working so you should get dns as well
[04:20] <LjL> Keyseir: nah don't remove it just yet, that won't fix it anyway
[04:21] <apokryphos> ubotu: tell chinny about xinerama
[04:21] <LjL> Keyseir: rather, try running firefox and apt-get under gdb, and pastebin what happens
[04:21] <atomikulinux> auto lo <NEWLINE>iface lo inet loopback<NEWLINE>iface eth1 inet dhcp<NEWLINE>auto eth2<NEWLINE>iface eth2 inet dhcp<NEWLINE>auto ath0<NEWLINE>iface ath0 inet dhcp<NEWLINE>auto wlan0<NEWLINE>iface wlan0 inet dhcp
[04:21] <Keyseir> LjL, ok
[04:21] <Keyseir> LjL, I appreciate your help.
[04:21] <atomikulinux> thats what my /etc/network/interfaces looks like
[04:22] <Keyseir> LjL, "gdb firefox" and "gdb apt-get"?
[04:22] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: you have an eth2 & ath0 i/fs?
[04:22] <atomikulinux> frogzoo: Nope
[04:22] <LjL> Keyseir: yes. then when at the gdb prompt, type "run" and "run install somepackage" respectively
[04:23] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: fire up text editor & comment out the i/fs you don't have
[04:23] <atomikulinux> hmm?
[04:23] <frogzoo> also you might like an "auto eth1"
[04:23] <atomikulinux> uhhh
[04:24] <LjL> Keyseir, a word of warning though, i'm already thinking that your best bet will be reinstalling... which doesn't mean we shouldn't try to find out what the problem is - just that i think we won't be able to really solve it. a segmentation fault like that isn't good
[04:24] <atomikulinux> okay so what I have is....
[04:24] <atomikulinux> auto lo<NEWLINE>iface lo inet loopback<NEWLINE>auto eth1<NEWLINE>iface eth1 inet dhcp<NEWLINE>auto eth0<NEWLINE>iface eth0 inet dhcp<NEWLINE>
[04:24] <atomikulinux> Good/Bad?
[04:25] <Keyseir> LjL, Understood.
[04:25] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: works for me
[04:25] <atomikulinux> ahhh
[04:25] <atomikulinux> but wait
[04:25] <atomikulinux> 20 lines down is some more
[04:25] <atomikulinux> Just the "auto eth 1"
[04:25] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: where'd all this crap come from?
[04:25] <atomikulinux> frogzoo: I honestly dont know
[04:25] <LjL> Keyseir: when gdb bails out due to the segfault, type "where" also - that will dump the function call stack. we want to find what library/whatever is causing the segfault
[04:26] <frogzoo> atomikulinux: k, just reboot
[04:26] <atomikulinux> Hmmm
[04:26] <atomikulinux> Okay.
[04:26] <atomikulinux> One thing though
[04:26] <atomikulinux> Earlier I was told to get up this shell script
[04:26] <chinny> thanks apokryphos - will have a read
[04:26] <atomikulinux> Basicaly, this shell script is in /etc/init.d/  it does that iptable and echo thing
[04:27] <atomikulinux> Those commands you do for connection sharing, and I have a symbolic link in the rcS.d as well
[04:27] <atomikulinux> they seem to be okay but...
[04:27] <Keyseir> LjL, when I enter "gdb firefox" part of what it says is that /usr/bin/firefox is not in executable format
[04:27] <atomikulinux> hmm nvm I'll just reboot and see what happens
[04:27] <atomikulinux> brb
[04:28] <Keyseir> LjL, Am I not using gdb properly , or is this an error with ff?
[04:28] <emilia> hey does anyone know how to access a folder i shared in ubuntu from windows xp?
[04:28] <voidmage> In firefox I can't get it to restore my session
[04:28] <emilia> i see the computer in my workgroup, but i cant see the shared folder
[04:28] <voidmage> It keeps restoring a session that was really old
[04:28] <voidmage> And not my most recent one
[04:29] <deusjevoo> how does ubotu work?
[04:29] <LjL> Keyseir: i'm not entirely sure. is that a 64 bit install?
[04:29] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell deusjevoo about bot | deusjevoo, you have a private message from Ubotu
[04:30] <LjL> Keyseir: type "file /usr/bin/firefox"
[04:30] <Keyseir> LjL, I'm not sure what that means. I used the desktop cd to install
[04:30] <LjL> Keyseir: ok, just paste the output from the file command
[04:31] <LjL> assuming it doesn't segfault ;)
[04:31] <Keyseir> LjL, /usr/bin/firefox: symbolic link to `../lib/firefox/firefox'
[04:31] <voidmage> I can't get firefox to properly restore my session, it restores a really old one instead of my last session
[04:31] <rhart> #exit
[04:32] <LjL> Keyseir: oh, right. type "file /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin"
[04:32] <frogzoo> !ubotu | deusjevoo
[04:32] <ubotu> deusjevoo: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[04:32] <atomikulinux> Okay then...
[04:32] <Keyseir> LjL, /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.0, stripped
[04:32] <atomikulinux> In the network settings... I have the eth0, the eth1 and the "modem" (which isnt activated) If I go to DNSes I notice that the only dns in there is 192.168.0.2
[04:33] <atomikulinux> Okay then, fair enough. I disable eth0 (which is the one going to the network)
[04:33] <LjL> Keyseir: matches with mine. unfortunately you won't easily be able to gdb that, because it won't start without the /usr/lib/firefox/firefox wrapper script
[04:33] <atomikulinux> I disable eth1, re enable eth1. close the network window, open it back up
[04:33] <LjL> Keyseir: just try using gdb on apt-get for now
[04:33] <atomikulinux> I look in dnses again. I see 194.168.4.100
[04:34] <Keyseir> LjL, righto
[04:34] <voidmage> I can't get firefox to properly restore my session, it restores a really old one instead of my last session
[04:34] <atomikulinux> and 194.168.8.100. Good. The internet now works
[04:34] <atomikulinux> Also. For the network locations drop down box, there isnt anything
[04:34] <atomikulinux> Shall I save what I currently have as "Internet" then make a new one where just the eth0 is enabled then save that as "Home network"?
[04:35] <frogzoo> voidmage: you're using restore tabs?

[04:36] <azcazandco> hi everyone
[04:36] <tuckerm|laptop> How can i make a shourtcut do the trash on the desktop?
[04:36] <atomikulinux> okay my internet might go off for a second while I test something
[04:36] <tuckerm|laptop> !shortcuts
[04:36] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about shortcuts - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:36] <azcazandco> how can I tell if my live install has stalled?
[04:36] <azcazandco> it seems to be taking ages to go beyond 15%
[04:36] <tuckerm|laptop> If theres no install shortcut
[04:36] <frogzoo> azcazandco: slow machine?
[04:36] <tuckerm|laptop> on the desktop
[04:36] <LjL> Keyseir: "/usr/lib/libapt-pkg-libc6.4-6.so.3.51" ... seems my initial guess about lib6 being messed up by automatix might still be a possibility ;)
[04:36] <tuckerm|laptop> !trash
[04:37] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about trash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:37] <azcazandco> I have an amd 3200+ with 2gb ram so it aint a slow machine
[04:37] <Keyseir> LjL, go you
[04:37] <Keyseir> LjL, is this repairable?
[04:37] <frogzoo> azcazandco: should be only 5 mins to boot tops
[04:37] <LjL> Keyseir, try another thing... i want to see what's going on with firefox.   strace firefox 2>&1 | grep "firefox-bin"
[04:37] <tuckerm|laptop> I want the trash to be on teh desktop instead of on my taskbard, how can i move it?
[04:37] <azcazandco> hmmm
[04:37] <LjL> Keyseir: i want to know whether the wrapper script is actually reaching the point where it starts the firefox binary, or it fails before that
[04:38] <azcazandco> it is booted but I am installing the os and it hasnt gone too far
[04:38] <uksprout> hi all ok I am back and I have display with video playback on my TV ... next problem it is only in black and white
[04:38] <Keyseir> LjL, by the way.. I'f had the problem with firefox for a few days and I used to be able to restart and it'd go away for a little while.
[04:38] <azcazandco> frogzoo:  you think Ia m better trying to restart the install?
[04:38] <Keyseir> LjL, I'm also concerned there might be something wrong with my HD physically because fsck found a relatively high amount of errors
[04:39] <atomikulinux> Hmm
[04:39] <atomikulinux> Its not the network locations thing
[04:39] <frogzoo> azcazandco: you can't install from the live cd (dvd yes)
[04:39] <Keyseir> LjL, maybe that's unlikely to be related.. but I thought i'd put it on the table.
[04:39] <Keyseir> LjL, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33480/
[04:40] <azcazandco> well it had the install option
[04:40] <azcazandco> i downloaded the desktop iso
[04:40] <atomikulinux> Arrrrggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (lol)
[04:40] <Pulim> someone can help me with a ATI vga
[04:40] <atomikulinux> Okay then... In my networks window I see eth0 and eth1 I cant have them enabled at the same time otherwise the internet wont work#
[04:41] <atomikulinux> but I need them both enabled for internet sharing wtf do I do lol
[04:41] <Pulim> i wanna improve the performance of my vga..
[04:42] <LjL> Keyseir: join #ubuntu-classroom
[04:44] <[tasty] freeze> I removed some software with its config files, but not when I run apt-get install it won't replace the config files I deleted... can someone gimme some advice please?
[04:45] <voidmage> apt-get --purge remove foo
[04:45] <voidmage> try that
[04:45] <cntb> how to install xerox phaser 3122 laser printer?
[04:46] <voidmage> cntb: how is it connected to your computer?
[04:46] <cntb> now USB
[04:46] <voidmage> should be as simple as running whatever add printer program is in gnome
[04:46] <voidmage> (i use kde)
[04:46] <cntb> has IEEE1284-PArallel option too
[04:47] <cntb> voidmage: now on KDE
[04:47] <[tasty] freeze> hmmm, i did apt-get --purge remove asterisk; apt-get install asterisk
[04:47] <s__v> hello
[04:47] <[tasty] freeze> it did not recreate /etc/asterisk, or the asterisk users...
[04:47] <cntb> why do you say so ? what about drivers ?printing language?
[04:48] <cntb> voidmage:  so you have an idea ? how to install xerox laser?
[04:49] <voidmage> i don't know the commands for gnome
[04:49] <voidmage> but should be as simple as adding the printer
[04:49] <cntb> why repeat? Iam on KDE
[04:49] <voidmage> oh
[04:49] <voidmage> you're on kde
[04:49] <uksprout> I only get black and white on my TV any suggestion? I think probably need to change a setting in xorg.conf as the colour is ok until the gui loads
[04:49] <voidmage> system settings->printers->add
[04:49] <cntb> saying it is simple is not an information voidmage
[04:50] <cntb> so here I would stop discussing that with you voidmage
[04:50] <voidmage> cntb: system settings->printers->add
[04:50] <cntb> ok
[04:50] <kandinski> hey
[04:51] <kandinski> I am about to do an ubuntu demo for windows users: which xgl and eyedcandy should I install: compiz? is there a cooler/more stable one?
[04:51] <atomikulinux> Okay I'm seriously having trouble
[04:52] <Toma-> kandinski: beryl?
[04:52] <kandinski> Toma, advantages?
[04:52] <Toma-> kandinski: ask in #ubuntu-xgl for more
[04:52] <kandinski> ta
[04:52] <Toma-> kandinski: themeable
[04:54] <cntb> conecting and disconnecting USBs on windows by default - makes a distinct sound
[04:54] <OoberMick> uksprout: if the video card outputs ntsc and the tv is pal you will see black and white. Does that sound like it could be the reason?
[04:54] <cntb> I would like KDE  to also make sounds on connecting USB. does it exist?
[04:55] <s__v> hello, just an information... i found a link broken on ubuntu.com how i can notify it to someone?
[04:55] <uksprout> OoberMick: thanks but no I have been using it like this with windoze and a different distro (mepis wouldn't show video playback though) in colour for quite some time
[04:56] <atomikulinux> Okay guys
[04:56] <eexp16> atomikulinux: sorry i was busy
[04:56] <atomikulinux> I'm nearly there with the connection sharing...  Ive got ipmasq and dnsmasq
[04:56] <atomikulinux> I go onto a windows computer and try to ping something...
[04:57] <atomikulinux> It seems to resolve the domain... but theres no responce
[04:57] <atomikulinux> I think its because I havent configured ipmasq and dnsmasq
[04:57] <eexp16> atomikulinux: you have to configure for eth0 something other than dhcp. you can't have dhcp on both interfaces.
[04:58] <atomikulinux> hmm
[04:58] <atomikulinux> okay
[04:58] <atomikulinux> for my eth0 one which is the one going to the network
[04:58] <atomikulinux> ill set the IP address to 192.168.0.1
[04:58] <atomikulinux> What about the gateway address?
[04:58] <atomikulinux> 192.168.0.1?
[04:58] <atomikulinux> or blank?
[04:58] <eexp16> atomikulinux: learn to use the right terms. its not "the network" but "your internal network"
[04:59] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Okay sorry
[04:59] <atomikulinux> My internal netowrk
[05:00] <eexp16> atomikulinux: first you need to choose a ip address range for your internal network. you have to put both eth0 and your windows pc's network card in that ip range.
[05:00] <jh__> 
[05:00] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Hmm?
[05:00] <eexp16> atomikulinux: and the range must differ from that one you get via dhpc on eth1
[05:00] <atomikulinux> Yeah
[05:00] <atomikulinux> for eth0 I have 192.168.0.1
[05:00] <jh__>     GUI     ?
[05:00] <atomikulinux> Woah chinese
[05:00] <atomikulinux> O_O;
[05:01] <atomikulinux> Anyway....
[05:01] <jh__>       ,
[05:01] <eexp16> atomikulinux: and which ip did you set on the windows side?
[05:01] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Im not sure I fully understand you
[05:01] <atomikulinux> Oh
[05:01] <voidmage> does firefox in ubuntu not have the ctrl+1 keybinds that are on the windows version?
[05:01] <atomikulinux> THey are manualy configured to use: 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.3
[05:01] <eexp16> atomikulinux: you are lacking basic network and routing knowlegde
[05:01] <atomikulinux> the gateway and preferred dns they are using is: 192.168.9.1
[05:01] <jh__> huck!!  talking Engilish?
[05:01] <atomikulinux> they can ping each other
[05:01] <Iulian> !ch
[05:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ch - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:01] <z9999> After many hours I finally got ndiswrapper -l to display  bcmwl5 driver present, hardware present. Can someone help me proceed from this point to finish installing the wireless?
[05:01] <Iulian> !cn
[05:01] <ubotu> For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[05:02] <atomikulinux> and they can resolve outside addresses
[05:02] <atomikulinux> but no reply from ping
[05:02] <eexp16> atomikulinux: so you have two windows machines?
[05:02] <atomikulinux> Yes
[05:02] <jh__> may I some Question?
[05:02] <GeekChick> Anyone know a good solution for diff files on windows? they're a pain in the arse.
[05:02] <jh__> Hey!!  Guys!!
[05:02] <voidmage> rebooting
[05:02] <eexp16> atomikulinux: okay. can you ping 192.168.0.1 from either windows machines?
[05:02] <jh__> .
[05:02] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Yup
[05:03] <eexp16> atomikulinux: did you set the gateway on both windows machines to 192.168.0.1?
[05:03] <z9999> GeekChick: MKS Toolkit
[05:03] <UFO64> if i want to set up a 6.10 server to run as a torrent tracker, what software should i use?
[05:03] <atomikulinux> eexp16: I think so
[05:04] <eexp16> atomikulinux: yes or no
[05:04] <atomikulinux> yes
[05:04] <atomikulinux> just changed now
[05:04] <eexp16> atomikulinux: okay. try to ping 139.175.2.5 from either windows machine
[05:04] <atomikulinux> okay
[05:04] <Condorcet> i need a help from someone experienced with xgl - after i tried emerald (it didnt work out) the window menager in my regular gnome session is gone. i cannot manipulate windows etc. can anyone help?
[05:04] <eexp16> atomikulinux: correction: ping 139.174.2.5
[05:05] <eexp16> atomikulinux: damn typos
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> wow
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> it's thanksgiving
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> why is everybody still here
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> rofl
[05:05] <atomikulinux> eexp16: No reply
[05:05] <cntb> give a thank then
[05:05] <diskus> thanksgiving is somekind of US thing only?
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> ?????
[05:05] <atomikulinux> diskus: yes
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> idk
[05:05] <Condorcet> coz not everyone is american linuxcrazy?
[05:05] <linuxcrazy> japan's stock market was closed
[05:05] <eexp16> atomikulinux: then the linux machine is not routing and/or masquerading the packets
[05:05] <atomikulinux> I think I just need to configure those two packages I installed
[05:06] <diskus> well here, today was normal working day
[05:06] <atomikulinux> eexp16: I just need to configure them but I dont know how
[05:06] <emilia> hey guys, i just right clicked on a folder on my ubuntu machine and shared it with smb, does anyone know how to see it from windows xp?
[05:06] <linuxcrazy> japan's markets were closed
[05:06] <diskus> japan and US is not everything in this world
[05:06] <linuxcrazy> so they must be doing something special....
[05:06] <atomikulinux> ipmasq and dnsmasq
[05:06] <linuxcrazy> diskus: chip on shoulder today?
[05:06] <eexp16> atomikulinux: i don't know this ipmasq package. i always set up routing/masquerading by hand.
[05:06] <Condorcet> can anyone tell me how to turn on window menager? i have NONE right now :/
[05:06] <cntb> emilia \\hosname\sharename on start run
[05:06] <atomikulinux> eexp16: yeah I tried doing it by hand as well
[05:07] <linuxcrazy>  what is a ? "menager"
[05:07] <Chinois> hahahahahaha
[05:07] <cntb> s/hosname/hostname
[05:07] <Condorcet> manager shut up :/
[05:07] <cntb> k emilia ?
[05:07] <atomikulinux> o rly
[05:07] <atomikulinux> In the end, all that matters is that I get this thing working
[05:07] <eexp16> atomikulinux: sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
[05:07] <atomikulinux> because my family members are shouting at me
[05:08] <atomikulinux> cause they dont have internet
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> rofl
[05:08] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Done
[05:08] <atomikulinux> shall I try and ping?
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> sure why not
[05:08] <eexp16> atomikulinux: no, wait
[05:08] <atomikulinux> Okay
[05:08] <atomikulinux> OKAY YES I KNOW MOM THE INTERNET WILL BE BACK ON SOON
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> tracert www.google.com
[05:08] <atomikulinux> JUST WAIT FFS
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> wait
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> is it tracping
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> traceping*
[05:08] <linuxcrazy> I forgot
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> try both
[05:09] <eexp16> atomikulinux: sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
[05:09] <atomikulinux> linux
[05:09] <Roscar> Hi, can somebody help me out with a simple Java problem?
[05:09] <atomikulinux> linuxcrazy: the tracert stops at 192.168.0.1
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> crap
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> internal router?
[05:09] <atomikulinux> eexp16: done it
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> how many routers do you have?
[05:09] <atomikulinux> im using this bot as a router
[05:09] <atomikulinux> *box
[05:09] <eexp16> atomikulinux: then ping again from windows machine
[05:09] <atomikulinux> okay
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> make sure their ip's are different
[05:09] <LadyNikon> i wonder how many times google.com gets pinged..tracerted and everything else
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> lol
[05:09] <linuxcrazy> who knows
[05:09] <ColiFato> i have the ubuntu 6.06 cd and i need to make an "server installation" or text mode only..  wich are the steps that i need do?
[05:10] <ColiFato> i dont need gnome or kde.. its a old pc and i only use for server..
[05:10] <ColiFato> i need press some key on bootup?
[05:10] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Nothing
[05:10] <linuxcrazy> Colifato: do you know linux shell?
[05:10] <ColiFato> yes
[05:10] <linuxcrazy> because if you don't you can just install regular ubuntu and do a simple LAMP install
[05:11] <nivekz> why can't i find realplay/realplayer from source
[05:11] <PMantis> Happy Thanksgiving! (to those in USA)
[05:11] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Sigh
[05:11] <linuxcrazy> nivekz: grab the repos
[05:11] <linuxcrazy> Same to you PMantis!
[05:11] <ColiFato> because the live cd cant run.. then i will try install only in text mode
[05:11] <atomikulinux> Damn it
[05:11] <linuxcrazy> ....

[05:11] <Roscar> I'm trying to run Azureus, but it can't use the freeJava that is installed. I instaled the Sun Java5 but when I type ''java -version'' it still shows version 1.4.2
[05:11] <atomikulinux> eexp16: okay lemme uninstall them
[05:12] <linuxcrazy> isn't there a selection to install the server?

[05:12] <Music_Shuffle> Hello
[05:13] <atomikulinux> eexp16: now nothing will resolve
[05:13] <atomikulinux> damn it
[05:13] <atomikulinux> It wouldnt be as bad if everyone wasnt shouting at me lmfao
[05:13] <Homer_Linux> any one here using the 64bit version of edgy i had a look in the forum and is the performance gain worth the hassle
[05:13] <atomikulinux> nvm ill just push them down the stairs and kill them all
[05:13] <UFO64> if i want to set up a 6.10 server to run as a torrent tracker, what software should I use?
[05:13] <atomikulinux> (lol joke)
[05:13] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Lets just start again
[05:14] <Roscar> anybody?
[05:14] <nivekz> cntb: yes i found this : " RealPlayer is available from Canonical's commercial 6.06 LTS (Dapper) software repository, but not for 6.10 (Edgy)."
[05:14] <linuxcrazy> rofl
[05:14] <atomikulinux> *cries*
[05:14] <eexp16> atomikulinux: installed any firewall on the linux machine that might block forwarding of packets?
[05:14] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Nope
[05:14] <linuxcrazy> find a realplayer .deb
[05:14] <Zaggynl> Roscar, I'm not very familiar with azureus, but utorrent works well with wine
[05:15] <linuxcrazy> the ones that worked on dapper will work on edgy
[05:15] <atomikulinux> eexp16: so how would you normaly do this
[05:15] <nivekz> linuxcrazy: ok thanks
[05:15] <Roscar> Zaggynl: does it then. I'll give that route a try.
[05:15] <Homer_Linux> yeah imho azureus works the best
[05:15] <Roscar> Thanks.
[05:15] <atomikulinux> I'm sure whats wrong is probably something obvious
[05:15] <Kim^J> Hi alla!
[05:15] <Kim^J> all*
[05:15] <atomikulinux> but because you cant see my screen you cant really see if something is wrong
[05:15] <MrMuin> hello people
[05:16] <eexp16> atomikulinux: do this: sudo iptables -F ; sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT ; sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT ; sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
[05:16] <nivekz> what is the default font called in edgy? i miss it very much and want to recover it
[05:16] <linuxcrazy> AM) Kim^J: what are you so happy about?! :(
[05:16] <linuxcrazy> lol
[05:16] <Zaggynl> Roscar, note: you have to add torrent manually and there are some minor interface quirks, but for the rest it works well
[05:16] <ys76> Hi there! I do have some trouble with Evolution (Edgy) and Shared folders on a cyrus-imapd. I am not able to see them at all. Anyone?
[05:16] <atomikulinux> eexp16: Done
[05:16] <Kim^J> linuxcrazy: Nothing really. Just got home from school! :D
[05:16] <linuxcrazy> =-O

[05:17] <MrMuin> I cant find it on the site
[05:17] <eexp16> atomikulinux: my internet connection will be cut in about 10 minutes...
[05:17] <eexp16> atomikulinux: yes, try
[05:17] <atomikulinux> oh crap
[05:17] <Roscar> Zaggynl: thanks. Unfortunetly it doesn't solve my basic problem of sun java being non fucntional.

[05:18] <linuxcrazy> MrMuin: http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[05:18] <atomikulinux> eexp16:  now theres nothing

[05:19] <diezare> OoberMick, I see only 1, and it's not efficient as before.
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> 192.168.0.1

[05:19] <linuxcrazy> wow
[05:19] <atomikulinux> okay
[05:19] <Sal> I'm new to Linux I've never installed it before I was kind of hoping someone could help me out
[05:19] <eexp16> atomikulinux: i will try to get online after the disconnect, but i cant promise anything
[05:19] <tonyyarusso> !language | atomikulinux
[05:19] <ubotu> atomikulinux: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> Sal:
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> it is easy
[05:19] <atomikulinux> :o
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> download the linux iso
[05:19] <atomikulinux> is damn an offensive word?
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[05:19] <atomikulinux> to you?
[05:19] <Sal> Yea lol I did
[05:19] <atomikulinux> if so
[05:19] <atomikulinux> then sorry
[05:19] <Sal> Hold on let me explain lol
[05:19] <linuxcrazy> ok
[05:20] <diezare> OoberMick, got any ideas?
[05:20] <Sal> I downloaded the Iso and booted into the live cd thing
[05:20] <atomikulinux> Lol what I ment was: poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo  poo
[05:20] <Sal> Played around with it a bit and started the installation
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> yeah
[05:20] <atomikulinux> ;)
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> oh poopoo!
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> lol
[05:20] <Sal> Before all this I amde about 20 gb free on a second hard drive in windows, I didn't partion it it was just unallocated space
[05:20] <atomikulinux> Hmmm
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> yeah
[05:20] <atomikulinux> apparently firestarter can do it
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> you have to resize the partition
[05:20] <PMantis> Does anyone know how to unmount an NFS dir after the remote server has one away? My client is hanging, hanging...
[05:20] <Sal> When I installed it I told linux to use the largest contiuing free space on that drive
[05:20] <linuxcrazy> crap
[05:21] <UFO64> if i want to set up a 6.10 server to run as a torrent tracker, what software should I use?
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> that wasn't the brightest move
[05:21] <Sal> Why?
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> resizing usually works better
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> and it might grab all the space
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> so you don't have any space on your windows partition
[05:21] <atomikulinux> sigh
[05:21] <Sal> Well it's on a second hard drive tho
[05:21] <Sal> not on my windows drive
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> ohhhh
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> ok well that's ok then
[05:21] <Sal> and the original partition is still intact
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> k
[05:21] <linuxcrazy> what's the problem?
[05:22] <Sal> Yea, the thing is
[05:22] <Sal> When i restart my computer, it just boots into windows
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> lol
[05:22] <Sal> There's no boot loader that lets me choose
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> ahahaha
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> yeah
[05:22] <Sal> lol
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> you know how to go into the bios?
[05:22] <Sal> With the del, yea
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> you need to set the first boot to ide2
[05:22] <cntb> linuxcrazy: try to listen ! dont troll here
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> or vice versa
[05:22] <Sal> ide2?
[05:22] <cntb> room has its purpose. support
[05:22] <Sal> First boot device?
[05:22] <linuxcrazy> CNTB?! WHAT THE CRAP?! I'm TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE SO SHUT UP NOOB!
[05:22] <LjL> atomikulinux: don't EVER do that again. ever.
[05:23] <modplug> is it possible to install ubuntu from an usb pen?
[05:23] <dream> Any one can help with samba
[05:23] <atomikulinux> LjL: okay sorry, dude
[05:23] <cntb> and the capitals now? you are atroll alright linuxcr
[05:23] <atomikulinux> ?
[05:23] <linuxcrazy> what is wrong with you guys?
[05:23] <atomikulinux> ?
[05:23] <linuxcrazy> I try to help someone and you kick me?
[05:24] <Sal> So, you mean go into the bios and to the boot devices priority screen thing? The one that's has like the cd, dvd, hard drive, floppy, etc etc, as to which it boots of first?
[05:24] <LjL> linuxcrazy: i'll ask you the same question
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> rofl
[05:24] <OoberMick> diezare: err what is the output of uname -a
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> you have problems man
[05:24] <cntb> what is wrong with you guys? - guys = what is wrong with you ?
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> ok Sal:
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> yeah
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> you need to set it to go to the second hard drive
[05:24] <linuxcrazy> or vice versa
[05:24] <Sal> Ohhh

[05:38] <bulmer> sethk: so i can select between agp and pci?

[05:40] <linuxcwazy> what version of USB?
[05:41] <linuxcwazy> 2.0 or 1.0?
[05:41] <sethk> spunconfuse, what command are you using to mount it?  You shouldn't be getting a message with the word "floppy" in it
[05:41] <linuxcwazy> 1.1*
[05:41] <spunconfuse> Its a sony usb memorystick reader.  its pluged in a usb2.0 but it was made for usb 1.0
[05:41] <linuxcwazy> hmmm
[05:41] <sethk> spunconfuse, then it's usb 1
[05:41] <linuxcwazy> and you're sure that this thing actually works?
[05:41] <spunconfuse> sethk, it auto detected it.
[05:41] <spunconfuse> but not correctly.
[05:41] <linuxcwazy> no

[05:43] <linuxcwazy> won't say a thing
[05:43] <sethk> spunconfuse, /dev/sdb is certainly wrong
[05:43] <sethk> spunconfuse, the device name is wrong, and you didn't give it a mount point
[05:44] <menyesg> i've got troubles creating a new raid array on server 6.10, does anyone have experience about mdadm under Ubuntu?

[05:47] <dpt> Hi, I've been trying to get a good installation of Ubuntu on an HP Omnibook 500
[05:47] <linuxcwazy> you're acting like a baby; if you would shut up so would I. who gave you admin rights anyway?!
[05:47] <dpt> I don't think it supports ACPI
[05:47] <PMantis> lol
[05:48] <dpt> powermanagement-interface seems to only support ACPI, which surprises me very much
[05:48] <cntb> he asked for it sooooooooo badly !
[05:48] <dpt> has no one encountered this prblem?
[05:49] <dpt> Is there a version of powermanagement-interface that uses APM?

[05:49] <spunconfuse> Sethk  is there a way to automaticaly mount my memory stick each time I boot?
[05:49] <sethk> spunconfuse, yes, you can add it to /etc/fstab
[05:49] <sethk> spunconfuse, is it always connected?
[05:49] <spunconfuse> sethk the reader is,  but I take the memory stick out all the time.
[05:50] <menyesg> hey guys, after creating a raid 1 array with mdadm with 2 sata disks, what shall I do to make it work after reboot? i have already modified mdadm.conf, and all I've done to Ubuntu Server 6.10 works with Debian but does not work with Ubuntu...
[05:50] <menyesg> does anyone have experience about mdadm?
[05:50] <sethk> spunconfuse, can't mount the reader, obviously.  If you add it to /etc/fstab, then you will be able to mount it without all the arguments
[05:50] <PlanarPlatypus> menyesg, just add it to /etc/fstab I think
[05:51] <spunconfuse> sethk what do you mean without the arguments?  sorry I'm prettymuch a newb.
[05:51] <sethk> spunconfuse, you cold use, say:    mount /dev/sdb1
[05:51] <atomikulinu1> okay
[05:51] <atomikulinu1> I had to remove those two packages because it made my internet not work
[05:51] <sethk> spunconfuse, then mount will look in /etc/fstab, and if it finds the line for /dev/sdb1, it will take the file system type, mount point, etc. from /etc/fstab
[05:51] <menyesg> PlanarPlatypus, well, i'm a bit confused... I have sda with 1 / and a swap, and I just want to create a raid mirror with it
[05:52] <spunconfuse> sethk ok cool.   So do I just add "mount -t msdo /dev/sdb1 /mnt/memorystick"
[05:52] <spunconfuse> msdo = msdos
[05:52] <sethk> spunconfuse, no
[05:52] <atomikulinu1> So is there anyone here that is experienced at setting up linux to share internet to an internal netowrk?
[05:52] <sethk> spunconfuse, look in /etc/fstab, you'll see the pattern.   use    man fstab   to get the details
[05:53] <spunconfuse> sethk, ok thanks a million. you have been more than helpfull.

[05:54] <spunconfuse> sethk one last question.  how did you know it would be on sdb1?
[05:54] <dpt> Akuma, what laptop do you have?  What suspend method?  When did they stop working?
[05:54] <johnpp> there is anyway to use proxy with ubuntu ?
[05:54] <sethk> spunconfuse, you told me you tried sdb, which I knew was very likely wrong.   after you plug in the stick, run dmesg.   it should tell you the /dev/sdX that it assigned the device when it was detected
[05:55] <eexp16> atomikulinu1: hello

[06:07] <jonah1980> sethk, ah weird, it's only a usb drive, i wanted to just completely blank it so i can back stuff up, it seems to have a few gig used up on nothing and this folder?
[06:07] <sethk> the thing about not using webmin is political, and I wish people would stop confusing political with technical
[06:07] <dpt> aios: If the low-level suspend isn't working, that's what I expect the problem to be
[06:07] <z9999> Luci3n: I'm used to using unix (AT&T retiree) but I seem to have finally found a driver that would load and ndiswrapper -l shows doth driver and hardware present now.
[06:07] <atomikulinu1> Okay webmin is uninstalled
[06:08] <recon> Somebody just said something to me, but I missed it. could please repeat?
[06:08] <jenda> Could someone help me sign a GPG key? I can't get it to work.
[06:08] <sethk> jonah1980, "nothing in that folder" is of course normal.  it's for placing recovered files after an fsck
[06:08] <aios> dpt: hmm. thats possible. i probably wouldnt have upgraded on purpuse, but i do have two choices of kernel in grub
[06:08] <cypher1> has any one got Fn keys to work in Sony Vaio ?
[06:08] <Luci3n> z9999 great news
[06:08] <LjL> sethk: would you mind explaining what's up with that to me (in -offtopic)?
[06:08] <jonah1980> sethk, i didn't realise that, i figured if it's an external backup drive it'd have nothing on there
[06:08] <sethk> jonah1980, also, a few gigs are always used up by file system overhead
[06:08] <dpt> aios: Just to check: Suspend to ram was working before?
[06:08] <sethk> jonah1980, you can erase the lost+found directory but it won't buy you anything
[06:08] <atomikulinu1> Ohhhhh somenoe please help lol
[06:08] <atomikulinu1> For some reason I just cant do masquerading with iptables
[06:08] <jonah1980> sethk - so am i best using ext3? i was told that fat32 couldn't support the full 160gb on linux over usb
[06:09] <sethk> jonah1980, the file system overhead is also normal.  It sounds, actually, as if you don't have a problem.
[06:09] <z9999> Luci3n: And what is the great news? I still can't get a wireless extension from iwconfig.
[06:09] <sethk> jonah1980, you should never use fat unless you need to read/write from both linux and windows
[06:09] <Luci3n> z999 sorry i thought you had it working
[06:09] <aios> dpt: well, everything 'power management' allows for seemed to work fine
[06:09] <jonah1980> sethk, i don't need to use the drive with windows, but is it ok in 1 partition on ext3? cos on fat someone said it would have to be in two partition
[06:10] <sethk> jonah1980, you mean because of the size?  the biggest I've done with ext3 is 120, but I don't know of a limitation like that.
[06:10] <dpt> aios: When you do the usual power management command, do you get the same symptoms as with what I suggested?
[06:10] <recon> Is there any program to edit options of the ALT-F* terminals (in my case, tty1)?
[06:10] <sethk> jonah1980, I would have to check.  in any event, definitely _don't_ use FAT, it has no permissions and is missing other important file system features.
[06:11] <jonah1980> sethk, yeah the size - is there anyway i can check the limit or could you for me?
[06:11] <sethk> jonah1980, let me take a look at the docs
[06:11] <jonah1980> sethk, i don't wanna back stuff up and then get screwd over by it corrupting or something and it's not convenient in two partitions
[06:11] <Kingsqueak> the limit on ext2/3 appears to be a 2TB filesystem
[06:11] <z9999> Luci3n: No, but I've made some progress after downloading about 8 different drivers. Finally found one at Compaq who made the notebook we're working on, but could not get their newest version to work, and just happened to find a slightly older version that would load.
[06:12] <jonah1980> sethk, thanks a lot = you've been loads of help, appreciated
[06:12] <sethk> jonah1980, as Kingsqueak said, the limit is way higher than 160 gig
[06:12] <kjodleik> I'm trying to build a new kernel on an ubuntu running on a virtual machine, but when I try to boot from that kernel it stops at the message "booting the kernel", any ideas?
[06:12] <Kingsqueak> sorry that's 2TB with 1k blocks 8TB with 4k blocks
[06:12] <sethk> Kingsqueak, either way, way higher than his requirements.
[06:13] <Kingsqueak> it's a lot of pr0n no matter what
[06:13] <sethk> Kingsqueak, it should choose 4k blocks automatically for larger sizes.
[06:13] <dpt> aios: Another suggestion: try 'sudo pmi action suspend'
[06:13] <GenNMX> I am trying to transfer files quickly through a gigabit crossover from Linux->Windows, but Samba is giving me ~50mbit/s and wu-ftpd is giving me ~10mbit/s. Both gigabit cards are on full-duplex, connected directly to each other.
[06:13] <jonah1980> oh thanks that's good news - how come it's so low on fat32 then? and why is fat32 at such a dissadvantage to ext3? also is ext3 better than ext2?
[06:13] <aios> dpt: no. its hard to describe though. in essence nothing happens (the fan/cpu stay on), but i get a black screen and a prompt to relogin
[06:13] <Unimatrix9> does ubuntu run on an lenovo 3000 c200? out of the box
[06:13] <aios> dpt: i'll try that. (brb)
[06:13] <Kingsqueak> the largest LUN I setup as a single fs has been only about 850Gb and there hasn't been any issue
[06:14] <LadyNikon> is there a GUI for Bind?
[06:14] <johnpp> does anyone knows where can i go to use proxy, please ? i am not doing nothing illegal or something like that.
[06:14] <delire> i'm trying to repair a broken MBR using an Ubuntu Dapper LiveCD. i've mounted and chrooted into the partition i want to grub-install from but what was once a /dev/sda a few hours ago no longer appears in /dev/ on the chrooted partition. any ideas why it would've disappeared?
[06:14] <GenNMX> LadyNikon: webmin has guis for a lot of stuff.
[06:14] <ale[x] > Kingsqueak, go suck on a turkey leg :)
[06:15] <Kingsqueak> I'm about to
[06:15] <ale[x] > werd homie!
[06:17] <LadyNikon> GenNMX: i dont see a webmin in the package manager
=== kud0s is now known as kud0s|working
[06:18] <kjodleik> LadyNikon: download it from www.webmin.com
[06:19] <Kingsqueak> if any of you setup webmin, please, be sure it's listening on localhost only or is firewalled
[06:19] <kjodleik> my servers are NATed and the webmin port is not mapped from the outside
[06:20] <Kingsqueak> kjodleik: yeah there you go
[06:20] <Unimatrix9> is there an ubuntu channel for the new macbook users? and ubuntu..
[06:20] <Kingsqueak> it's handy but it's a large chunk of code to leave 'lying around' re: webmin
[06:21] <atomikulinu1> hmm
[06:21] <Corynick> Hey there guys!
[06:21] <atomikulinu1> so does webmin work with ubuntu?
[06:21] <kjodleik> webmin is universal even works with windows
[06:21] <Kingsqueak> Unimatrix9: this might help http://tuxmobil.org/apple.html
[06:21] <atomikulinu1> okay
[06:21] <GenNMX> webmin works with Debian, so Webmin works with Ubuntu
[06:21] <atomikulinu1> and webmin can do all that NAT and port fowarding stuff, yes?
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> that masquerading
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> atomikulinu1: you just want a GUI for firewall?
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> because ive been trying to do masquerading for the past 6 hours
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> I just need something that an do it
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> atomikulinu1: try firestarter, it's a lot simpler
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> Okay
[06:22] <Kingsqueak> atomikulinu1: apt will have that
[06:22] <Unimatrix9> ok thanx
[06:22] <GenNMX> atomikulinu1: qtables.radom.org, very easy firewall setup
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> cool
[06:22] <atomikulinu1> ill try firestarter
[06:22] <Corynick> I have some major problems, I have Dapper on my file server and recently some directories have been randomly disappearing and reappearing.....has anyone had the same troubles?
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> if that doesnt wrok ill try what GenNMX said
[06:23] <kjodleik> a friend of mine recommends clarkconnect distro for firewalling
[06:23] <Kingsqueak> atomikulinu1: yeah 'apt-cache search iptables'  there are a few
[06:23] <AdamTheCamper> Ehlo, when I try to copy large file my ubuntu freezes around 50%. Can anyone help?
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> Nice
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> Its not just the fact that I cant get internet sharing done
[06:23] <soccrmastr> ok guys, i started up my laptop its running Xubuntu. I never save sessions, but I have been using abiword lately. every time i start up abiword starts up, my panel, and my bottom workspace tab doesnt open. i have to navigate through middle click. i looked through settings and cant get it to come back. how do I make it appear?
[06:23] <eexp16> atomikulinu1: are you ignoring me?
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> its the fact that theres people shouting at me lol
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> eexp16: Nope
[06:23] <atomikulinu1> ive tried everythig youve said
[06:23] <meisam> hi guys i need to install IBM DB2 on my edgy
[06:23] <meisam> how can i do it?
[06:24] <meisam> i searched a lot
[06:24] <Kingsqueak> atomikulinu1: actually   apt-cache search firewall
[06:24] <meisam> no answer
[06:24] <Kingsqueak> and it's turkey time for me
[06:24] <eexp16> atomikulinu1: do you mind to take this to a separate channel?
[06:24] <pitti> cypher1: did you try 'sudo echo foo > /proc/blah'?
[06:24] <atomikulinu1> Setting up firestarter (1.0.3-1.2ubuntu3) ...
[06:24] <meisam> IBM DB2 guys?
[06:24] <atomikulinu1> hmm
[06:24] <atomikulinu1> okay
[06:24] <GenNMX> atomikulinu1: If you want a real powerful firewall, get Shorewall.
[06:24] <atomikulinu1> #atomikus_trouble
[06:24] <LjL> pitti: the sudo is either useless or ineffective there
[06:24] <soccrmastr> panel/workspace tab guys?
[06:24] <eexp16> atomikulinu1: okay
[06:24] <LjL> pitti: the redirection is done by the shell, which is not running as root
[06:25] <meisam> guys u dun have any idea of installing IBM DB2?
[06:25] <LjL> pitti: sudo sh -c "echo foo > /proc/blah" does the trick (or "sudo -i" and then do it from there)
[06:25] <juliux> hi i read at ubuntuforums that it is possible to enable the master mode at atheros wlan cards, but i get an error if i want to set the mode any ideas or hints?
[06:25] <AdamTheCamper> Anyone knows why should ubuntu freeze when I copy a file from ntfs to xfs ?
[06:25] <tom47> meisam have you been to >>>> http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp
[06:25] <Corynick> I have some major problems, I have Dapper on my file server and recently some directories have been randomly disappearing and reappearing.....has anyone heard of this?
[06:26] <milaks> Hi
[06:26] <milaks> Although I've selected dictionary and program (aspell) in Settings->KDE Components->Spell Checker, when I type message in Kopete it doesnt reacts acordingly.
[06:26] <milaks> Does anyone knows how to fix this?
[06:26] <kads> Cirynick
[06:26] <kads> corynick what do you mean by dissappering
[06:27] <LjL> milaks: tried restarting kopete?
[06:27] <delire> bah weird. a grub-install on a chrooted partition using a /proc/devices means you need to MAKEDEV your block devices all over again.
[06:27] <Corynick> kads: they just seem to vanish
[06:27] <skinnison> Anyone here know how to get sound working in eft?
[06:27] <meisam> how can iuse ASP.net here?
[06:27] <kads> Corynick: can you ls-a | grep  them
[06:27] <AdamTheCamper> Nobody knows why my ubuntu freezes when I copy 700 mb movie from ntfs to xfs?
[06:27] <delire> i mean to say a /proc/ mounted on a different partition
[06:27] <kads> Corynick: or you can't see them in nautilus
[06:27] <milaks> LjL: Several times
[06:27] <LjL> AdamTheCamper: is it actually a local NTFS drive, or a Samba share?
[06:28] <Corynick> kads: can't see them in nautilus
[06:28] <kads> Corynick: ctrl+h
[06:28] <CharlieSu> happy thanksgiving everyone
[06:28] <AdamTheCamper> I tried ntfs, samba, even copy from cd
[06:28] <kads> Corynick: try that
[06:28] <AdamTheCamper> when i had ext3 it behaved the same
[06:28] <Corynick> kads: is ctrl-h for hidden?
[06:28] <LjL> AdamTheCamper: couldn't your HD be broken?
[06:28] <kads> Corynick: yup
[06:28] <Fer> hola
[06:29] <kads> Corynick: also right click and refresh
[06:29] <Corynick> kades: they are not hidden..tried that
[06:29] <AdamTheCamper> LjL:  I tried ntfs, samba, even copy from cd
[06:29] <AdamTheCamper> when i had ext3 it behaved the same
[06:29] <pitti> LjL: I know, cypher1 asked some question in #ubuntu-devel, and I asked him whether this was the source of confusion
[06:29] <LjL> pitti: ok, i see
[06:29] <kads> Corynick: ok open up terminal and go to the directory
[06:29] <spunconfuse> are there better irc programs for linux, other than xchat?
[06:29] <AdamTheCamper> LjL: I dont know, its a new one, but system works fine...
[06:29] <kads> Corynick: and then ls -a | grep nameofyourfile
[06:30] <Corynick> kads: can we move to a less busy channel?
[06:30] <LjL> AdamTheCamper: look at /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog (and perhaps other logs) for any hint. a trick is, assuming your drive is /dev/hda, something like "grep -i hda /var/log/*"
[06:30] <kads> Corynick: I am fine here
[06:30] <LjL> AdamTheCamper: i think you should also install "smartmontools", and run "smartctl -H" and "smartctl -A" on your drive to see if there might be anything suspicious
[06:30] <cypher1> pitti, thanks
[06:31] <kads> Corynick:  the names highlight for me so np
[06:31] <AdamTheCamper> LjL: Couldnt it be cause it is a sata hd?
[06:31] <pitti> cypher1: you probably want to do 'echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/blah
[06:32] <Corynick> kads: sounds good, i cant access my terminal at the moment as i am surface scanning the drive
[06:32] <LjL> AdamTheCamper: uhm, i haven't the slightest idea, because i never dealt with SATA. however i did sometimes hear things to the effect that SATA support for some chips might not be quite fine
[06:32] <kads> Corynick:  k
[06:32] <kads> Corynick:  let me just tell you what could have happened
[06:32] <Corynick> kads: these files are also SAMBA shared btw
[06:33] <kads> Corynick:  ahhh
[06:33] <pierrebz> Cannot boot from this CD  please use CD2 or try a bios update... What do I do now?
[06:33] <kads> Corynick:  on the computer that they are saved did you give the directory and files read access to everybody
[06:33] <aios> dpt: sorry, got a phone call. http://pastie.caboo.se/24147
[06:33] <Corynick> kads: yes
[06:33] <kads> Corynick: everybody
[06:33] <Corynick> kads: yes
[06:34] <Corynick> wide open
[06:34] <kads> Corynick: try this add the username that you use to connect to the serving computer
[06:34] <Corynick> kads: i cant even view the files from the serving computer
[06:34] <pierrebz> Anyone here supporting ubuntu 6.10?
[06:34] <dpt> aios: Do you have acpi support in your kernel at all?  Can you do ls /proc/acpi?
[06:35] <kads> Corynick: hold on. For example I access my file server through a username called getter, on the fileserver I have a username configured called getter
[06:35] <aios> dpt: what, that does exist
=== uet is now known as BlackHawk
[06:36] <aios> dpt: the kernel is 2.6.17-10-386
[06:36] <kingace> i'm currently running dapper.. is it worth it to upgrade to edgy using the update manager?
[06:36] <LjL> kingace: if there isn't anything that you need in Edgy, probably not
[06:36] <kads> kingace: use apt-get dist-upgrade && apt-get install -f
[06:37] <spunconfuse> edgy has blender 2.42a :D
[06:37] <proselyte> how good is ubuntu firewire support, specifically for an external hard drive
[06:37] <Corynick> kads: i store all of my files under one directory on my serving computer, but it is only some of the subdirectories that i am unable to see, all of which i could view/edit two days ago
[06:37] <kingace> what are significant new features under edgy?
[06:37] <kingace> also when is fawn supposed to come out?
[06:37] <LjL> kingace: this might be a good place to look https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy
[06:37] <kads> COrynick: again is the username on the client computer on the fileserver
[06:37] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell kingace about schedule | kingace, you have a private message from Ubotu
[06:37] <Corynick> kads: yes
[06:38] <dpt> aios: Weird.  On the log you posted, the key line is /etc/acpi/sleep.sh: line 39: echo: write error: Resource temporarily unavailable.  This line is the one I had you do manually before
[06:38] <kingace> LHL: thanks
[06:38] <kads> Corynick: hmm, what about the access level of this user
[06:38] <kingace> *LJL
[06:38] <proselyte> how is firewire hard drive support
[06:38] <tom47> kingace https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
[06:38] <kads> Corynick: that is weird! can you paste bin the ls -a of that directory
[06:38] <Corynick> kads: complete access is enabled
[06:39] <dpt> aios: I think I'm running out of ideas.
[06:39] <johnpp> anyone can help me please ? about proxy in ubuntu
[06:39] <Corynick> kads: i have an 80gig drive and my surface scan is taking forever
[06:39] <johnpp> please ?
[06:39] <kads> Corynick: I don't know how to speed it up srry
[06:39] <aios> dpt: well, thank you very much for trying. you gave me a few keywords to play with, so i'll see what i can learn
[06:40] <Corynick> kads: could bad sectors on a drive etc. cause that kind of problem?
[06:40] <proselyte> has anyone gotten a firewire hard drive working with ubuntu?
[06:41] <emilia> anyone want to help me with glslideshow? i changed the default folder to my pictures folder, which has ~200 images, but it keeps loading the same picture over and over again
[06:41] <spunconfuse> how did you all learn so much about linux? How can I obtain such knowledge?
[06:41] <kads> Corynick: If you suspect bad sectors run fdisk
[06:41] <kads> Corynick: or just restart the computers
[06:41] <kads> Corynick: restarting will check the sectors
[06:41] <Corynick> kads: tried restarting
[06:42] <pierrebz> Can someone point me to ubuntu boot problem faq please?
[06:42] <CharlieSu> spunconfuse: reading..  goto Barnes and Nobles and get a book on Server management..
[06:42] <kads> Corynick: what are you files called
[06:42] <kads> Corynick: give a example name
[06:42] <SGL> Hello! Question: How do I play a .wav file on ubuntu command line?
[06:42] <CharlieSu> spunconfuse: It takes years to really understand the ins and outs of linux..
[06:43] <Corynick> kads: a file or direcotry?
[06:44] <manmadha> hiii i have installed mono to do asp programs .....But i have no idea how to use it......can any one tell me about the sequence of steps to be followed .....
[06:44] <SGL> How do I play a .wav file on ubuntu command line?
[06:44] <manmadha> SGL, through totem
[06:44] <ahmed> hello world
[06:45] <CharlieSu> spunconfuse: did you get that?
[06:45] <metatag> hello all ..
[06:45] <spunconfuse> CharlieSu,  server management, interesting.  I'll probably never run a server for anyone.  Though I like the idea of using linux for my desktop.   I read alot of the beginner guids at LDP.  Do you think It would help me much to setup a server and read up on server management?
[06:45] <kads> Corynick: both
[06:45] <metatag> how do i set my computer to shutdown in 3 hours?
[06:45] <SGL> Thanks manmadha... installing now :)
[06:45] <pierrebz> man shutdown
[06:45] <CharlieSu> spunconfuse: yes..  because all of linux is run on services..  even the desktop is run ontop of xorg...   you need ot understand how linux does things like runlevels...
[06:46] <Corynick> kads: for example production/company/1653g.qpw
[06:46] <metatag> pierrebz: do you have the command with arguments?
[06:46] <CharlieSu> spunconfuse: BRB..  5 mins
[06:46] <kads> Corynick: when did this problem start did you install any nautilus plugins?
[06:46] <pierrebz> not here..
[06:46] <spunconfuse> CharlieSu,  I do want to become more competant using linux.    sounds like there might be alot to learn.
[06:46] <Corynick> kads: no installations
[06:46] <pierrebz> dont have linux running
[06:46] <tom47> spunconfuse coming here is a very fine first step ..... the next step is to look at the ubuntu documentation and then maybe peruse some online resources .... this is a good thing to go through http://www.chongluo.com/books/rute/
[06:46] <techwhore> anyone here knows if you may use pam_keyring to store your ssh passwords in the keyring ?
[06:47] <kads> Corynick: are you running any antiviruses
[06:47] <Corynick> kads: nop
[06:47] <manmadha> hiii i have installed mono to do asp programs .....But i have no idea how to use it......can any one tell me about the sequence of steps to be followed .....
[06:47] <metatag> i want my computer to automatically shutdown in 3 hours .. can anybody help?
[06:47] <metatag> pierrebz: oic
[06:47] <kads> Corynick: what are the operating systems of both the computers
[06:47] <ScribbleJ> metatag: man shutdown
[06:47] <kads> Corynick: can you see the files on the server
[06:48] <Corynick> kads: file server=ubuntu dapper  client=windows xp pro
[06:48] <metatag> ScribbleJ: do you have the specific command? is it a cron job?
[06:48] <Corynick> kads: been running fine for months
[06:48] <spunconfuse> tom47 right on, thanks  I'll pick threw this site.
[06:48] <kads> Corynick: can you give me your samba conf
[06:48] <kads> Corynick: paste this in pastebin.com
[06:48] <ScribbleJ> metatag, something like: sudo shutdown -h -t 4500
[06:49] <Corynick> kads: surface scan still runnning
[06:49] <ScribbleJ> That's a little more than three hours, 4500 seconds.
[06:49] <metatag> ScribbleJ: thanks mate
[06:49] <kads> Corynick: oh yeah forgot
[06:49] <kads> Corynick: there is not much I can do without specifics man
[06:49] <kads> Corynick: srry
[06:49] <techwhore> anyone here knows if you may use pam_keyring to store your ssh passwords in the keyring ?
[06:50] <Corynick> kads: yes i realize that, the surface scan is getting there..this thing has got me stumped
[06:50] <kads> Corynick: same here
[06:50] <Corynick> kads: i'm actually hoping for a bad drive...at least that would explain it

[06:55] <SGL> enlighenment?
[06:55] <SGL> (btw... I use Xubuntu)
[06:55] <ScribbleJ> Starting it might be as simple as typing esd at the command prompt -- BUT I didn't answer at first because I honestly know jack about it.
[06:55] <SGL> ok :)
[06:55] <ScribbleJ> I use Xubuntu as well, with Xgl and Compiz -- LOVE it. :)
[06:55] <SGL> nah... command not found :P
[06:56] <SGL> Ok
[06:56] <ScribbleJ> But I don't use totem. :(
[06:56] <Bilange> AnthonyG, yeah, gparted is on the LiveCD
[06:56] <SGL> I just use it because it's on a shitty computer :)
[06:56] <manmadha> AnthonyG, yaa there is any option to divide the drives
[06:56] <SGL> Hahaha
[06:56] <delire> i'm writing a Blender manual. does anyone know if there is a way in Ubuntu to include the mouse cursor in a screenshot?
[06:56] <Bilange> (or is it gpartd?)

[06:56] <SGL> cya
[06:56] <spunconfuse> is there anything missing in xubuntu?
[06:56] <ScribbleJ> ...if you can call that "Help."
[06:56] <AnthonyG> Bilange: Great , Thank you :)
[06:56] <ScribbleJ> Spunconfuse -- no, it's just Ubuntu with Xfce as the default desktop.
[06:57] <meisam> sorry guys do i need to install XSP for ASP.net?
[06:57] <spunconfuse> I heard xubuntu used less resources.
[06:57] <spunconfuse> is it better than using gnome?
[06:57] <ScribbleJ> Xfce4 is generally considered to be more lightweight than KDE or Gnome.
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> "Better" is up to you.
[06:58] <spunconfuse> ScribbleJ  all the software runs on it though?
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> Yes, you can run anything you like on it - but if you stick to using your ususal gnome apps it will load the gnome libraries and you don't save much over using gnome.
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> :)
[06:58] <spilio> hola
[06:58] <spunconfuse> ScribbleJ interesting.  thanks
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> I am addicted to konqueror, so I use it regardless, and I still prefer xfce. :)
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> spunconfuse :
[06:58] <ScribbleJ> Here's how you can try it out:
[06:59] <ScribbleJ> Just: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[06:59] <NegativeSpace> In my home folder I seem to have a few folders named core.<some numbers>, which are rather large. Can anyone tell me what they are and if I can delete them safely?
[06:59] <ScribbleJ> That'll keep all your existing stuff in place, but you'll haev the option when you log in to pick "afce" as a session on the login screen.
[06:59] <ScribbleJ> "xfce"
[06:59] <spunconfuse> cool
[06:59] <ScribbleJ> At which point you're basically running xubuntu.  Yuo can switch back by picking "gnome" at the login screen.
[07:00] <Music_Shuffle> What's better about the other managers?
[07:00] <riddlebox> how can I tell what filesystem is on a partition/drive?
[07:00] <ScribbleJ> Music - it's mostly personal preference.  I suggest trying them out.
[07:00] <Phuzion> Is there a package that I can install with apt to get flash working on firefox?
[07:00] <riddlebox> Phuzion, check out easyubuntu
[07:00] <pierrebz> Where can i find some troubleshooting information for failing to boot of iso?
[07:00] <Music_Shuffle> ScribbleJ, which all exist besides xfce? (Tried that)
[07:00] <ScribbleJ> Phuzion: sudo apt-get install flash-nonfree
[07:00] <Phuzion> riddlebox, where do I find easyubuntu?
[07:00] <Music_Shuffle> And I have Gnome and KDE already installed
[07:00] <Phuzion> ScribbleJ:  Thanks
[07:01] <spunconfuse> I got flash9 working by extracting the flash9 file into the .mozilla directory.
[07:01] <nikin> re

[07:01] <nikin> i have managed, but it was middlebutton
[07:01] <Phuzion> thanks
[07:01] <ScribbleJ> Music Shuffle: those are the big ones, but there are some others.... fluxbox is popular mostly for being really lightweight.
[07:01] <Music_Shuffle> So that's what...sudo apt-get install fluxbox*?
[07:01] <Phuzion> ScribbleJ:  Can't find the package
[07:01] <spunconfuse> thanks for all the help and information everyone.  I gota run.  l8r all.

[07:29] <jerp> mine went off lastnight, it told me I had booted 30 times and was checking
[07:29] <sportman> i have the tar for 5.52-29772
[07:29] <Ayabara> notwist: I have dled it now, and I'm stuck at the startupscreen :-D
[07:29] <brianski_> Zylche: why can't it be both?
[07:29] <redeeman> manmadha: you will probably want to use mod_mono - im sure it includes a sample configuration for apache, but i don't use ubuntu, so i don't know, but im sure the mono site and mod_mono distribution contains documentation
[07:29] <notwist> Ayabara: lol
[07:29] <sizzam> sportman: you need a c compiler and the linux kernel headers.  so, before you start the install do this:    sudo aptitude install linux-headers build-essential
[07:29] <Ayabara> kinda like when I got stuck in vim
[07:29] <Zylche> brianski_, you only have 1 slot left for an attitude.
[07:29] <notwist> Ayabara: just "sudo apt-get install rtorrent"
[07:29] <Zylche> Your core temperature can't flucuate that much!
[07:29] <sizzam> sportman: after you install those two packages, you should be able to kick off the vmware installer, you have to do it from the command line
[07:29] <manmadha> redeeman, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ok thank u
[07:29] <redeeman> manmadha: hang on a minute, ill get you a link
[07:29] <notwist> Ayabara: then run "rtorrent -p [your listening port] -[listening port again] "
[07:29] <sportman> ok
[07:29] <brianski_> fsck /dev/zylche
[07:29] <sportman> give me a second
[07:29] <manmadha> ok
[07:30] <Zylche> pff
[07:30] <Zylche> <_<
[07:30] <sportman> any chance we can talk in pm sizzam ?
[07:30] <brianski_> ;)
[07:30] <Ayabara> notwist: done that and started it. how do I exit?
[07:30] <sizzam> sportman: yep, i was just going to tell you to do that
[07:30] <Zylche> chown -hR sandwich /*
[07:30] <notwist> Ayabara: ctrl+q i think
[07:30] <notwist> Ayabara: there's a pretty good manual for it on their webpage
[07:30] <notwist> Ayabara: basically you use backspace to import a torrent, the arrows up and down to select
[07:31] <notwist> Ayabara: arrow right brings up the peer list, etc. - you'll become pretty comfortable with it real fast
[07:31] <notwist> Ayabara: also the backspace importing supports wildcard so you could import for example /home/notwist/Desktop/*.torrent
[07:31] <notwist> or just *
[07:31] <notwist> but you'll get errors from all the files that are not torrents :)
[07:31] <Ayabara> notwist: ok. got it started now. have you put much stuff in .rtorrent.rc? I think all I need at first is to set dl limit, ul limit, and directories
[07:31] <Ayabara> ok
[07:32] <notwist> Ayabara: i have never changed that file
[07:32] <notwist> Ayabara: i use the ASD and ZXC buttons to limit my upload
[07:32] <Ayabara> notwist: ok. getting offtopic now, but I'll try it out. thanks :-)
[07:32] <notwist> A = +1 Z = -1
[07:32] <notwist> S = +5 X = -5
[07:32] <notwist> i think you get the system if you look at your keyboard :)
[07:33] <notwist> Ayabara: also, there's no beating a text based client when it comes to perfomance ;)
[07:33] <Ayabara> notwist: this is fun :-D
[07:33] <notwist> Ayabara: it's great to know too if you're going to setup a seedbox sometime on a text based system
[07:34] <anto> how on earth do i install pecl?
[07:34] <anto> anyone active her?
[07:34] <IndyGUnFreak> sudo apt-get install pecl?
[07:34] <notwist> Ayabara: also you can press -> and then "o" to bring up the tracker menu, ptyping a * will activte/deactivate the selected tracker
[07:34] <anto> it can't find the package :S
[07:35] <notwist> Ayabara: deactivating a tracker can be nifty on private trackers that record your data ;)
[07:35] <Ayabara> notwist: ok. never done that in other clients, so I probably won't need it
[07:35] <IndyGUnFreak> what is pcl?
[07:35] <IndyGUnFreak> pecl
[07:36] <anto> its a extension from PHP
[07:36] <w3ccv> bg
[07:36] <anto> its installed by default in php 5.1.4 >
[07:36] <IndyGUnFreak> not sure, sorry
[07:36] <anto> but sudo apt-get install only provides php 5.1.2
[07:36] <voidmage> Azureus won't start now
[07:36] <manmadha> redeeman, hee....can u give me the link..?
[07:36] <notwist> anto: tried reloading the sources?
[07:36] <Ayabara> notwist: a torrent will dl to the dir I started it from?
[07:36] <voidmage> Azureus gets through the splash and as soon as it loads the main screen it closes
[07:37] <voidmage> What would I do to trace it or something?
[07:37] <notwist> anyone here knows how i add shortcuts to the Xfce bar at the top? i cant drag and drop them :/
[07:37] <Arrick> whats the command to delete linux partitions?
[07:37] <notwist> Ayabara: i think it downloads to the folder you were in when you started rtorrent in the console, often your ~
[07:37] <Ayabara> ok
[07:38] <anto> notwist what do you mean?
[07:38] <azcazandco> hey folks ca anyone tell me why this install of ubuntu is taking over 2 hrs?
[07:38] <voidmage> How can I found out why azureus isn't starting?
[07:38] <notwist> anto: i tried Xfce, there was a firefox shortcut there by default in the top bar, but i couldnt drag and drop anything from the "applications" menu which had terminal and all that stuff
[07:38] <IndyGUnFreak> azc, are you running a 100mhz pc?

[07:40] <AWOSLappy> Arrick, have you tried qtparted?  or on the CLI, fdisk
[07:40] <calamari> I can't remember.. how much disk space does the default installation of Ubuntu take?  About 2 gb, plus extra for swap?
[07:40] <Arrick> AWOSLappy command line
[07:41] <Ayabara> notwist: I don't think it uses as much resources as azureus either ;-)
[07:41] <notwist> calamari: something like that
[07:41] <Luci3n> ubotu do you know anything ???? ;)
[07:41] <apokryphos> calamari: around 1.8 gigs, yeah. Plus swap.
[07:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about do you know anything ???? ;) - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:41] <notwist> calamari: xubuntu takes about 1,5
[07:41] <IndyGUnFreak> i think 2gb would be minimum
[07:41] <AWOSLappy> Arrick fdisk
[07:41] <rickyfingers> Arrick: just re-format

[07:41] <Music_Shuffle> Fluxbox is supposed to be really quick and leightweight, isn't it?

[07:41] <manmadha> redeeman, ok dude..... i am leaving now///////
[07:41] <notwist> Music_Shuffle: Xfce is pretty neat too
[07:41] <IndyGUnFreak> i don't like fluxbox.
[07:41] <manmadha> byee
[07:41] <calamari> my stepmother wants Linux for a Christmas present.. it's really cool :)
[07:41] <apokryphos> Music_Shuffle: fluxbox is very lightweight, indeed
[07:41] <AWOSLappy> How do I get Firefox 2 on to Dapper?
[07:41] <notwist> calamari: lol, cheap for you :)
[07:41] <Music_Shuffle> apokryphos, then why's it so...slow for me? >.>
[07:42] <AWOSLappy> calamari, wow.  my grandmother got Linux for her birthday -- and she LOVED IT!
[07:42] <IndyGUnFreak> Awos, i was never able to get it to work.
[07:42] <apokryphos> Music_Shuffle: insanely slow PC? ;-)
[07:42] <notwist> AWOSLappy: just open the Synaptic packet handler
[07:42] <AWOSLappy> notwist, um, packet?
[07:42] <calamari> notwist: well, sure.  But cool, because she has been in Windows hell for a while now and she wants out.  I'm really excited
[07:42] <Rochvellon> if got a problem: i'm using ubuntu 6.10 and firefox won't be closed correctly. only if i close it manually i'm able to reopen the ff.
[07:42] <AWOSLappy> notwist, oh oh you mean package.  I was going to open ethereal :P
[07:42] <Music_Shuffle> apokryphos, nuh uh...KDE runs just fine.  Flux lags insanely though.
[07:42] <apokryphos> Music_Shuffle: well run a top and see what's eating what up.
[07:42] <No-Face> hi , i'd just like to know if there's a way to install ubuntu without loading the desktop ! that friggin PC is too crappy to launch it all the way :'(
[07:42] <Music_Shuffle> Run a what..?
[07:43] <notwist> AWOSLappy: um sry :P
[07:43] <apokryphos> Music_Shuffle: 'top'
[07:43] <AWOSLappy> notwist np :)
[07:43] <voidmage> Any way I can figure out why azureus doesn't start?
[07:43] <Music_Shuffle> ./Nub and needs to know what that is, and how to. ;P
[07:43] <AWOSLappy> No-Face try the alternate install CD.
[07:43] <cntb> ubuntu wont surf on some new notebooks
[07:43] <cntb> who will raise the glove
[07:43] <notwist> _anyone_ here running Xfce that can tell me how i add new items to the top bar? :S
[07:43] <syntaxx> No-Face: sudo apt-get remove gdm? heh
[07:43] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle, go to a terminal, or CTRL+ALT+F2, I don't care how, just get to a command prompt.  and type the word top in.
[07:44] <apokryphos> notwist: #xubuntu
[07:44] <killown> how I do to set xserver-xgl to use as server X?
[07:44] <AWOSLappy> notwist, try #xubuntu ?
[07:44] <calamari> notwist: check out this quote: http://rafb.net/paste/results/kvkyF816.html

[07:44] <IndyGUnFreak> it says Top: -N required qrgument
[07:44] <No-Face> AWOSLappy is there no magic line i can type ?
[07:44] <notwist> calamari: what about it?
[07:44] <AWOSLappy> No-Face, um, not as far as I know.
[07:44] <calamari> notwist: did you read it?
[07:44] <notwist> calamari: well yeah
[07:45] <AWOSLappy> calamari, oh heavens what mailing list was that on?  ubuntu-n00bs?
[07:45] <calamari> AWOSLappy: mailing list?
[07:45] <No-Face> AWOSLappy syntaxx whoa , what is it ?
[07:45] <voidmage> Quick question, what do I use for a startup script?
[07:45] <AWOSLappy> calamari, yeah >
[07:45] <calamari> AWOSLappy: That was an email my stepmother sent me, wanting Linux for Christmas
[07:46] <No-Face> AWOSLappy ok , i'll get the alternate then I guess ! thz a lot !
[07:46] <calamari> AWOSLappy: well, part of the mail anyways
[07:46] <Music_Shuffle> AWOSLappy, biggest usage is 6% by FF on KDE...total usage sums to about 30%.  No way it should lag with that.
[07:46] <AWOSLappy> No-Face np :)
[07:46] <AWOSLappy> calamari ahhh.
[07:46] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle you're right.
[07:46] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle, and memory?
[07:46] <calamari> anyhow thanks for the size estimate
[07:46] <Music_Shuffle> 30 mb by FF, rest counting that sums to about 150 of 512.
[07:48] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle wow.  and MHz?
[07:48] <Music_Shuffle> For stats?  Or the proc in general?
[07:49] <Music_Shuffle> In general, its a 2.4B Northwood P4.  And its running KDE fine, same with Gnome.  Did I install Flux wrong? >.>
[07:49] <IndyGUnFreak> Flux doesn't work for me either..
[07:49] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle, wow this is in Fluxbox?
[07:49] <sethk> Music_Shuffle, your lag is not caused by your load
[07:49] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle, I have no clue what the problem is.
[07:49] <IndyGUnFreak> 2.4ghz Athlon, 1gb RAM, KDE, Gnome, Xcfe run perfectly
[07:49] <sethk> Music_Shuffle, not caused by the window manager either
[07:49] <sethk> IndyGUnFreak, that's a configuration issue.
[07:50] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle, /join #fluxbox?
[07:50] <Music_Shuffle> Right, that's why I'm wondering...did I just..install the wrong packages mayhaps?
[07:50] <nalioth> tom47: did you need something?
[07:50] <sethk> Music_Shuffle, hard to imagine that the wrong packages would run, but run slowly.  virtually impossible.
[07:50] <IndyGUnFreak> it probably is sethk
[07:50] <fulldisclosure> Hi, is there a blue human official theme?
[07:50] <IndyGUnFreak> i get no desktop icons, no way to menus, just a mouse and a desktop.
[07:50] <sethk> IndyGUnFreak, has to be, certainly you have more than enough capacity to run it.
[07:50] <Music_Shuffle> just fluxbox, the menu for it, and fbdesk, right?
[07:51] <sethk> IndyGUnFreak, well, fluxbox is supposed to be light.
[07:51] <IndyGUnFreak> yeah, but honestly, i'm perfectly happy with Gnome, i just tried to install it, to see what the hubbub was about.
[07:51] <sethk> IndyGUnFreak, if you don't want light, don't run fluxbox
[07:51] <lasindi_office> Hi everyone, I've set up an HP DeskJet 420 (recognized as DeskJet 400) in Ubuntu, and it appears to work, but I cannot configure it to use less ink. The ink it prints out is very heavy and comes through to the other side of the paper. The only thing I can configure is normal color, normal grayscale, draft color, and draft grayscale; on each of these options is 300 dpi for the resolution. Is there a way to modify the ink usage?
[07:51] <Music_Shuffle> Right, and I figured out how to access stuff, but 4-5 seconds from click on anything to running it..not ok.
[07:51] <fulldisclosure> Hi, is there a blue human official theme?
[07:51] <sethk> Music_Shuffle, no, something is definitely wrong there.
[07:51] <IndyGUnFreak> blue human official?

[08:03] <uksprout> Spee_der: et all that gave me help with this video problem many many thanks I now have video playback with sound in colour on my TV
[08:03] <notwist> Ayabara: nope
[08:03] <voidmage> In kpilot when I set it to sync with kontact, it then deletes all my calendar and todos on my palm.
[08:03] <voidmage> Anyone know why?
[08:03] <AWOSLappy> voidmage, that wouldn't be fun.  but,maybetry#kubuntug?
[08:04] <AWOSLappy> Oops
[08:04] <AWOSLappy>  spaceisn'tworking
[08:04] <dabaR> fulldisclosure: http://blogs.gnome.org/view/thos/2006/11/20/0 try that
[08:04] <AWOSLappy> voidmage, that wouldn't be fun.  But, maybe try #kubuntu ?
[08:04] <sethk> voidmage, make sure it is set to merge, not cover palm with computer settings
[08:04] <AWOSLappy> That was weird.  I had to punch SPACE very very hard to get it to work.
[08:04] <voidmage> where is that?
[08:04] <dabaR> fulldisclosure: does not really mean you can change the color of the title bar, as far as I understand it...
[08:04] <sethk> AWOSLappy, it can't tell how _hard_ you punch something.
[08:05] <fulldisclosure> dabaR, I see
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> sethk, I know, I just mean, that was weird.
[08:05] <voidmage> sethk: where is that setting?
[08:05] <AWOSLappy> sethk, then it works again.  I just had to hit it very hard.  it was like something was stuck or something.
[08:05] <sethk> voidmage, I'm not sure, I haven't done it for a while.  but it definitely exists.
[08:06] <Arrick> AWOSLappy dust in the contact can cause that
[08:06] <ariel> hey there
[08:06] <Phuzion> does anyone here know anything about automatix?
[08:06] <Phuzion> anyone use it
[08:06] <ariel> i have an apache question, should i ask here or on apache?
[08:06] <mister_roboto> Phuzion: I used it, in spite of all the warnings :)   works for me
[08:06] <Phuzion> depends, is it about installing it, or is it about configuring it?
[08:06] <apokryphos> !automatix | Phuzion
[08:06] <ubotu> Phuzion: automatix is is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Since it is often hard to track and solve problems caused by Automatix, you might find it easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[08:06] <Phuzion> !worksforme
[08:06] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[08:06] <HumanPrototype> hi
[08:06] <ariel> Phuzion: I need help configuring it
[08:07] <dabaR> ariel: both
[08:07] <Phuzion> ariel:  #apache then
[08:07] <Music_Shuffle> Phuzion, I love those two bot entries. xD
[08:07] <AWOSLappy> Arrick, or maybe a potato chip crumb :P
[08:07] <Arrick> yep
[08:07] <Arrick> later all
[08:07] <dabaR> bye arrai
[08:07] <HumanPrototype> is it possible to tell my cups server on my main pc to just pick up the settings from the cups server on another pc (my server with the printer on)
[08:07] <arrai> ?
[08:07] <sethk> HumanPrototype, sure.  make your cups client configuration file have only one line in it, the server line, with the ip of the print servber
[08:07] <dabaR> sorry
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> arrai, dabaR hit the tab
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> arrai, arrick was already gone :)
[08:08] <sethk> HumanPrototype, everything will come from the server
[08:08] <dabaR> AWOSLappy: thank you
[08:08] <AWOSLappy> dabaR, np :)
[08:08] <voidmage> sethk: Would the sync setting be in kpilot or kontact?
[08:08] <sethk> voidmage, in kontact.
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> voidmage, I was assume kontact, but I'm not sure.
[08:09] <ariel> ok nobody answers on #apache
[08:09] <ariel> so here's my question
[08:09] <apokryphos> ariel: check the documentation
[08:09] <ariel> I did
[08:09] <GionnyBoss> hi all and good day to all ubuntu users ;)
[08:09] <tom47> #cherokee???
[08:09] <apokryphos> hi GionnyBoss
[08:09] <sethk> ariel, what question?
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> Hello GionnyBoss.
[08:09] <ariel> my pb is the following
[08:09] <AWOSLappy> tom47 hahahaha
[08:09] <idigtal> my sound isn't working because your mixer cannot be found.. :) How would i fix that? its a bit diffucult
[08:09] <ariel> I have my website in my public_html
[08:10] <sethk> idigtal, I already told you
[08:10] <AWOSLappy> idigtal, are you a member of the sound group?
[08:10] <ariel> and i want all my links to /something/ to point to my public_html
[08:10] <GionnyBoss> hey guys... I have to change monitor gamma... I used xgamma, but settings are not changed in xorg conf, so when I reboot it's the same as before... I don't remember the command... there was a command to run as su to change gamma in xorg conf. Can anybody help me, please?
[08:10] <ariel> not the actual / of the filesystem
[08:10] <AWOSLappy> idigtal, sorry audio group
[08:10] <dabaR> idigtal: you can find out by running groups in a terminal
[08:10] <ariel> i guess it's a chroot
[08:10] <sethk> ariel, that's the default behavior
[08:10] <ariel> right?
[08:10] <sethk> ariel, no
[08:10] <ariel> mmh
[08:11] <ariel> sethk: what's the default behavior?
[08:11] <dabaR> ariel: /home/ariel/public_html?
[08:11] <ariel> yeah
[08:11] <sethk> ariel, your HTTP user will see a reference to /xyz not as /xyz, but as relative to the http root
[08:11] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss, have you tried sudo xgamma?
[08:11] <dabaR> ariel: that is not a chroot
[08:11] <sethk> ariel, probably /var/www/whatever
[08:11] <ariel> sethk: I want to have it in public_html
[08:11] <dabaR> ariel: the web site should be accessible at http:/ariel.com/~ariel
[08:11] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, no, in fatct I didn't try it... but I remember when I used Fedora that there was another command that I don't remember now, unfortunately
[08:11] <ariel> because I have several users working on different copies of the same website
[08:12] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss, ahhhh.
[08:12] <ariel> each user has a copy in their public_html
[08:12] <sethk> ariel, that's fine, you asked about having /xyz not be really /xyz, and I merely pointed out that /xyz is _not_
[08:12] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, I would try it anyway... but I'm sure it was a different command. Just don't remember... my f***ing memory :P
[08:12] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss, same here :P
[08:12] <ariel> ok sethk, let me try
[08:12] <sethk> ariel, it doesn't work that way
[08:13] <dabaR> hehe
[08:13] <sethk> ariel, apache can implement virtual servers.  but it can't change the path to a particular place on a particular server based on the id of the connector
[08:13] <dabaR> idigtal: run "groups" in a terminal, see if audio shows up
[08:13] <AWOSLappy> ariel, http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#symptoms
[08:13] <ariel> ok let me reformulate the question
[08:13] <GionnyBoss> Pelo, ahahah lol! No no, I'm not drunk anymore! But I'm a bit crazy also when I don't drink :P
[08:13] <zainka> Hi, anyone who can help me in a step to step tutorial in how to mount an firewire external hdd. Youst 'private' me if you can help. Thanks in advance (by the way, sorry if interrupting)
[08:13] <HumanPrototype> or just to get my printer to work so my server shares it correctl
[08:13] <idigtal> Awoslappy i have type in termanal : groups it show adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
[08:13] <AWOSLappy> idigtal, okay.
[08:13] <ariel> I have this website hosted on 1and1.com
[08:14] <Music_Shuffle> AWOSLappy, I just installed...another 4-odd managers.  If Flux hates me, they ALL can't. ;P
[08:14] <idigtal> so do i belong to the audio group?
[08:14] <ariel> there, if in my html page i have an href to "/lib/something.php"
[08:14] <AWOSLappy> Music_Shuffle hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[08:14] <dabaR> idigtal: that sounds right, yes you do. What command do you run to get the mixer not found?
[08:14] <ariel> it will look in the lib directory of my website
[08:14] <AWOSLappy> idigtal, yes because it has the word audio' in it
[08:14] <AWOSLappy> ariel, no
[08:14] <voidmage> hmm.
[08:14] <voidmage> maybe it would help if i had all of kdepim installed
[08:14] <GionnyBoss> and now the REAL big problem... MPlayer plugin for Mozilla Firefox! it doesn't work... even if I can play the same links if I cut and paste url in MPlayer
[08:14] <sethk> voidmage, wouldn't hurt.  might or might not help
[08:14] <AWOSLappy> ariel, it will go for /var/www/htdocs/lib/ (or wherever your htdocs folder is)
[08:14] <idigtal> dabar at my right icon show mixer cannot be fond
[08:15] <emilia> i have gnome desktop search, and i cant type in it, but the history menu works good, it shows all the stuff i typed before, i tried restarting but it didnt help, anyone have any idea?
[08:15] <idigtal> the KMIX icon
[08:15] <voidmage> it has some kontact components i'm probably missing
[08:15] <dabaR> zainka: I can help you in the channel probably. Run sudo fdisk -l in a terminal, and show me the output on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[08:15] <voidmage> which might have that setting
[08:15] <dabaR> idigtal: the sound icon in the top right?
[08:15] <idigtal> dabaR and AWOSLappy
[08:15] <AWOSLappy> idigtal...?
[08:15] <idigtal> on my bottom right
[08:15] <azcazandco> ha... I have just been out for half an hour and this install has moved 1%
[08:15] <idigtal> how would i fix that
[08:16] <AWOSLappy> idigtal right.  the little horn
[08:16] <idigtal> to enable or fix to have sound playing
[08:16] <AWOSLappy> idigtal has it EVER worked in Ubuntu?
[08:16] <dabaR> idigtal: you use gnome as your desktop?
[08:16] <azcazandco> is there a way I can cancel the install and then check the integrity of the sata drive I am trying to install onto?
[08:16] <idigtal> nope
[08:16] <ariel> ok AWOSLappy, let's assume it's right on my webhost
[08:16] <ariel> now what about on my dev machine
[08:16] <dabaR> idigtal: which one then?
[08:16] <alexcamilo> i've heard some people telling me that linux incorrectly identifies the "VIA C3 Samual 2 2000" as an intel 646. and the intel 646 has a few instructions that the via c3 doesn't have and this causes system lock ups. is this true and if it is is there any way to get ubuntu in a form that it will work with this chip?
[08:16] <idigtal> awoslappy and dabar answer nope
[08:16] <ariel> with the website in public_html
[08:16] <ariel> where would it look for the files?
[08:16] <AWOSLappy> dabaR, KDE.
[08:17] <ariel> if the path is /something
[08:17] <Pelo> azcazandco,  what are you trying to do ? upgrade to edgy ?  it takes a long time , just go and have a long nap
[08:17] <AWOSLappy> dabaR, Kmix?  def KDE.
[08:17] <dabaR> ariel: publich_html/something
[08:17] <idigtal> kmix
[08:17] <Music_Shuffle> Well, I hate that one.  Next!
[08:17] <azcazandco> Pelo: fresh install of dapper on another drive
[08:17] <azcazandco> I have never had long install times before
[08:17] <azcazandco> dunno if it is the drive or the cd that might be causing the probs
[08:17] <Pelo> azcazandco,  if there is nothing else on there you need to save just pull the plug
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> ariel: /var/www/html/something
[08:18] <unfo> alexcamilo: i find that hard to believe.
[08:18] <dabaR> ariel: oh, that is a hard one...try linking to the page with something rather than /something
[08:18] <AWOSLappy> ariel: or /home/something/public_html
[08:18] <unfo> alexcamilo: just try the ubuntu livecd.
[08:18] <idigtal> i use kde
[08:18] <azcazandco> Pelo: I am in live cd installing just now
[08:18] <ariel> yeah but i need an absolute path
[08:18] <idigtal> the Kubuntu
[08:18] <azcazandco> dont need to save the drive has been wiped and partitioned
[08:18] <ariel> because i want to use mod_rewrite
[08:18] <dabaR> ariel: try /~ariel/something then
[08:18] <alexcamilo> ok
[08:18] <azcazandco> just taking ages to install to iy
[08:18] <alexcamilo> thanx
[08:18] <GionnyBoss> http://members.aol.com/jrzycrim01/mozilla/wmp/vidtest-HS.html ... can you see this link correctly in firefox? with mplayer plugin? can anybody try it, please?
[08:18] <azcazandco> to it even
[08:18] <ariel> and if i use a relative path, all the links are messed up
[08:19] <GionnyBoss> I can see it only if I cut and paste in mplayer, but not directly from firefox
[08:19] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoos, you mean the MediaPlayerConnectivity?
[08:19] <azcazandco> Pelo: is there a command to check the drives integrity from a live cd?
[08:19] <Pelo> azcazandco,  it shouldn'T take so long, something is off,  kill it , verify stuff, and start again
[08:19] <zainka> Hi, anyone who can help me in a step to step tutorial in how to mount an firewire external hdd. Youst 'private' me if you can help. Thanks in advance (by the way, sorry if interrupting... again)
[08:19] <Pelo> azcazandco,  I don'T know about that
[08:19] <idigtal> AWOSLa[[y and dabaR are you thre
[08:19] <AWOSLappy> idigtal yes
[08:19] <theplatypus> I've added a new hd to my system and formated it with gparted, but I'm unable to access it. Can anyone help?
[08:19] <urmom> im using an ibook g4, how can i get my airport express to work?
[08:19] <dabaR> idigtal: I do not know how kde uses sound, sorry
[08:19] <azcazandco> Pelo: what did you mean by verify stuff?
[08:19] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, I just mean the mplayer plugin... don't know the tecnical name... I can't see videos in firefox... on Fedora Core I could see them with mplayer plugin
[08:19] <urmom> i still have mac dual booted
[08:20] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss, okay, so it should play IN Firefox, not you click on it and mplayer comes up?
[08:20] <Music_Shuffle> I like IceWM, anyone else like it?
[08:20] <Pelo> azcazandco,  didn'T you want to check the hdd's integrety and stuff ?
[08:20] <urmom> gionnyboss, go back to fedora imo its better
[08:20] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, yes
[08:20] <azcazandco> Pelo: yes but how is what I want to know
[08:20] <mats> urmom: easy, https://wiki.kubuntu.org/FrodeDoeving/iBook
[08:20] <GionnyBoss> urmom, do you think so? I don't know... ubuntu looks good
[08:20] <Pelo> azcazandco,   I don'T know
[08:20] <Jordan_U> urmom: You just need firmware, I have the needed firmware on my site, I'll get a link.
[08:20] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss okay.  with MediaPlayerConnectivity you click it and mplayer pops up
[08:21] <azcazandco> k
[08:21] <urmom> gionnyboss, i use fedora on all my pcs cept this mac
[08:21] <levander> Is anyone in here using an IRC bouncer or proxy?  I need to install a good one on my system and don't know which one to pick.
[08:21] <azcazandco> will maybe try and burn a fresh cd
[08:21] <unfo> levander: just use IRC less :)
[08:21] <dabaR> urmom: ask urmom. just joking, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/
[08:21] <mats> urmom: under wlan ;)
[08:21] <urmom> thanks
[08:21] <AWOSLappy> levander, WHY would you want to ask about an IRC bouncer *ON* IRC?!
[08:21] <idigtal> awoslappy
[08:21] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, how can I install MediaPlayerConnectivity?
[08:21] <AWOSLappy> idigtal What?
[08:21] <idigtal> is there any way i could fix that
[08:21] <levander> AWOSLappy: because I figure there are a lot of IRC users on IRC is why
[08:21] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss googl
[08:21] <AWOSLappy> e
[08:21] <idigtal> kmix problem
[08:22] <voidmage> I'm impressed, ubuntu managed to detect my playstation controller
[08:22] <GionnyBoss> urmom, I just wanna try ubuntu better first... I have ubuntu just from 1 day... I wanna try it
[08:22] <AWOSLappy> idigtal, have you tried #kubuntu ?  #kde ?
[08:22] <voidmage> and it ran perfectly in zsnes
[08:22] <theplatypus> I've added a new hd to my system and formated it with gparted, but I'm unable to access it. Can anyone help?
[08:22] <AWOSLappy> voidmage, ?  you hooked it to your computer?
[08:22] <urmom> gionnyboss, kool
[08:22] <dabaR> idigtal: see also if there is another mixer that you can use in the sound control panel
[08:22] <voidmage> Yeah
[08:22] <voidmage> And i'm impressed it Just Worked(tm)
[08:22] <unfo> voidmage: feel free to post a thank-you message on ubuntu-devel, it'll give the devs a lift for the day.
[08:22] <AWOSLappy> voidmage :)
[08:23] <AWOSLappy> voidmage, yeah do what unfo said.
[08:23] <AWOSLappy> dabaR, not in KDE.
[08:23] <Jordan_U> voidmage: Linux has drivers for a lot of controllers, I got my snes controller to work connecting it directly to the parallel port :)
[08:23] <AWOSLappy> Jordan_U WOW.
[08:23] <AWOSLappy> :)
[08:23] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, but it's weird that I can't just see it in firefox... I will try to google for mplayer plugin... MPlayer gives me an error when I start a movie of a missing plugin, but then I click "OK" and I can see the movie... strange! I guess this is the problem
[08:23] <run1> hey. does anyone heres uses nvidia twinview? I cannot make the 2nd monitor (vga w/ vga2dvi adapter) work. the light just blinks
[08:23] <erUSUL> theplatypus: add a line to fstab adding the disk
[08:23] <dabaR> idigtal: try aptitude search kmix, and see whether the first letter on the line is an i.
[08:23] <unfo> all : should I file openoffice feature requests in launchpad or upstream?
[08:24] <voidmage> In windows that controller needed a driver for the connector, then a run to config it
[08:24] <voidmage> VERY impressed here
[08:24] <theplatypus> erUSUL: what do I use for the mount point
[08:24] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss yeah.  Google for "MediaPlayerConnectivity" because then you aren't forced to use JUST mplayer, you can use totem, vlc, anything else.  even real RealPlayer.
[08:24] <GionnyBoss> AWOSLappy, ok! in fact it looks like a better idea
[08:24] <GionnyBoss> thanks
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> GionnyBoss np :)
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> I must be off, bye all.
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> and Happy Thanksgiving!
[08:25] <dabaR> AWOSLappy: same, see ya
[08:25] <mats> is it thanksgiving to day?
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> dabaR see you!
[08:25] <unfo> mats: only in the USA. Canadian thanksgiving is over.
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> mats yes
[08:25] <AWOSLappy> unfo :)
[08:26] <mats> unfo: :-) hehe - ok! Have fun eating turky
[08:26] <mats> or something O_O
=== levander` is now known as levander
[08:26] <theplatypus> Can anyone help with setting a mount point in /etc/fstab for a newly installed hd?
[08:27] <unfo> mats: i'm canadian :)
[08:27] <dabaR> theplatypus: sure
[08:27] <mats> unfo: so there isnt any food for you to day?
[08:27] <levander> Is there some IRC command, like a '/list *ubuntu*' that will show me all channels that have ubuntu in the name?
[08:27] <levander> I thought I had done that command before, but it's not working.
[08:27] <dabaR> theplatypus: run sudo fdisk -l and post output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org, then give us a link.
[08:28] <unfo> 14:27 CTCP VERSION reply from levander: ERC Version 5.0.4 $Revision: 1.726.2.20 $ - an IRC client for emacs (http://erc.sf.net (comments mailto://mlang@delysid.org))
[08:28] <mats> emacs < vim
[08:28] <theplatypus> its located at /dev/hdc1
[08:28] <theplatypus> if that is what your looking for
[08:29] <HumanPrototype> or just to get my printer to work so my server shares it correctl
[08:30] <dabaR> theplatypus: what is the file system type?
[08:30] <theplatypus> dabar ext3
[08:30] <levander> unfo, why did you print that out?
[08:30] <unfo> mats: correct. and vim rules.
[08:31] <GionnyBoss> I go to eat something... se ya later
[08:31] <delire> is there a workaround for a USB keyboard not being detected by grub? the bios sees it but as soon as grub kicks in, goodbye input.
[08:31] <unfo> levander: because maybe erc has better /list functionality... dunno
=== GionnyBoss is now known as GionnyBoss[away] 
[08:31] <unfo> levander: try /msg chanserv list *ubuntu*
[08:31] <theplatypus> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33513/
[08:32] <dabaR> theplatypus: then you just need to enter something like /dev/hdc1       /media/hdc1            ext3    defaults              0       0" given /media/hdc1 is where you want to mount, and that you do not want users other than root to have write access to it.
[08:32] <dabaR> theplatypus: show your /etc/fstab on a pastebin too after you make an attempt at entering that line.
[08:32] <theplatypus> dabar I would like all users to have write permissions. Its just for backup data
[08:33] <unfo> is there a utility like gnome-fstab-editor?
[08:33] <unfo> if not they should make one.
[08:35] <dabaR> theplatypus: then you change defaults to defaults,rw
[08:35] <levander> unfo: that seemed to work, but it didn't list a couple of channels I know exist, like #ubuntu-motu or #ubuntu-ops
[08:35] <unfo> levander: dunno, ask the freenode support people.
[08:37] <B-Minus> does anyone know a program to cut mp3s ?
[08:37] <unfo> B-Minus: cut?
[08:37] <unfo> you mean rip?
[08:37] <theplatypus> dabaR: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33515/
[08:39] <B-Minus> no
[08:39] <dabaR> theplatypus: thanks. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33516/ is more like it, I think. try that, save the file, then run sudo mount -a and post the output of ls -ld /media/hdc1. Make sure you do really have the /media/hdc1 directory
[08:39] <B-Minus> i want to use an mp3 as ringtone but i only want the middle part

[08:41] <HumanPrototype> where can i find a working guide to how to set up a printer on a cups print server to be shared with both windows and linux machines (without using samba)
[08:42] <hentai> I just ate Thanksgiving Dinner at the D-Fac
[08:42] <theplatypus> dabaR:  sudo mount -a
[08:42] <theplatypus> mount: mount point /media/hdc1 does not exist
[08:42] <theplatypus> grifter@darksky:~$ ls -ld /media/hdc1
[08:42] <theplatypus> PoPpiLLs: /media/hdc1: No such file or directory
[08:42] <hentai> all the sargeant majors and first sargeants and commanders etc were there serving us in dress blues.

[08:43] <dabaR> then try the last two again
[08:43] <HumanPrototype> and why is the help.ubuntu.com site down - it is maintenance or just my pc or just my bad luck?

[08:49] <dfgas> on ubuntu server how do i configure the network card
[08:49] <unfo> dfgas: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, then use the gui tools :)
[08:49] <bimberi> dfgas: ifconfig (or editing /etc/network/interfaces)
[08:49] <dabaR> theplatypus: I am not sure what to do to get write privileges at mount. Your drive will likely be mounted with only read and browse privileges at boot. You can change that with the sudo chmod -r 777 /media/hdc1 command likely. Try this, run sudo chmod -r 777 /media/hdc1, then sudo umount /media/hdc1, then sudo mount -a, then ls -ld /media/hdc1 and see whether drwxrwxrwx shows up as the permissions
[08:49] <Pichu0102> Doesn't seem to do anything in GNOME.
[08:49] <Jordan_U> dfgas: /et/network/interfaces

[08:52] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: Sure.
[08:52] <theplatypus> sudo chmod -r 777 /media/hdc1
[08:52] <visik7> unfo: maybe you can setup it
[08:52] <DreamerHxC> Jordan_U so...?
[08:52] <DreamerHxC> please

[08:54] <Jordan_U> tim167: Did you try System -> Administration -> printing ?
[08:54] <unfo> why m4lt.com instead of maltsmith.com or whatever?
[08:54] <Jordan_U> unfo: Why reboot?
[08:54] <unfo> Jordan_U: good point
[08:55] <compengi> how should i configure ubunu to make it read russian?
[08:55] <malt> unfo: because malt.com was took and i wanted something short and smith is not my last name and my last name is to long
[08:55] <theplatypus> dabaR: I can cd into if that is any help
[08:55] <unfo> tim167: plug it in, wait 15 seconds, File > Print
[08:55] <unfo> compengi: ask in #ubuntu-ru :)
[08:55] <tim167> yes I tried plugging it in and printing a file, but it doesnt appear, I'll look in 'printing, or reboot maybe' thanks!
[08:55] <unfo> tim167: no need to reboot.
[08:56] <pablo_> hola
[08:56] <DreamerHxC> Jordan_U done
[08:56] <Jordan_U> tim167: System -> Administration -> printing :  add printer, it should detect it automatically.
[08:57] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: sudo apt-get update
[08:57] <DreamerHxC> done
[08:57] <Jowi> tim167, first thing first. can you print a test page from the printer manually by the buttons on the printer?
[08:57] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[08:57] <Limulf> I'm running OpenOffice 2.0.4 in Ubuntu 6.10. I'm using an inverse high contrast color theme (dark blue background and white text) My problem is that even though normal text and OpenOffice's Draw objects are correctly displayed automatically, OpenOffice's Math's are displayed with blue background and black text, so I don't see a thing.
[08:57] <Limulf>  I have already tried changing colors  in the color scheme section of tools_options_OpenOffice.org and  checking and unchecking boxes in the accessibility section of tools_options_OpenOffice.org. Is there a way to make the text inside Math formulas also look white?
[08:57] <unfo> compengi: anyway, what do you mean "read russian"?
[08:57] <Limulf>  Thanks for your time.
[08:57] <Przemcio78>  on a scale from 1 (extremely easy) to 10 (extremely hard) how would you rate ubuntu?
[08:58] <DreamerHxC> Jordan_U it was already installed
[08:58] <theplatypus> ok if I can write to it and read from it if I sudo first. That is workable, but seriously annoying
[08:58] <compengi> unfo, i have some files that are named in russian the system reads them as ?????
[08:58] <theplatypus> compengi : gibberish
[08:58] <theplatypus> :)
[08:59] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and choose fglrx, did graphics ever work on the box ?
[08:59] <DreamerHxC> yeah
[08:59] <DreamerHxC> sometimes when I reboot
[08:59] <unfo> compengi: in bash or in nautilus?
[08:59] <DreamerHxC> sometimes it works but when I reboot again....
[08:59] <theplatypus> ls -a
[08:59] <unfo> compengi: vim? emacs? openoffice?
[09:00] <compengi> unfo, in nautilus and in gedit
[09:00] <dabaR> theplatypus: ya, I am not sure, it is very inconsistent I am finding, here it allows for write with the same setup as yours. Yesterday another user was here, we had to chmod the drive to get the permissions, now it does not allow chmod for you...
[09:00] <DreamerHxC> Jordan_U when I type sudo dpkg...it says that /etc/X11/xorg.conf has been customized and doens't do anything
[09:01] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: That is fine, now run: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart
[09:01] <DreamerHxC> ?dm
[09:01] <DreamerHxC> ?
[09:01] <unfo> compengi: i don't know :(
[09:01] <theplatypus> dabaR: I can work with this for now. I just want to store some files in order to do a clean install without losing those files
[09:01] <DreamerHxC> done
[09:01] <compengi> theplatypus, do you know?
[09:02] <theplatypus> with a little luck the new install will create the correct permissions
[09:02] <DreamerHxC> I can see the login screen, I can log but it doesn't show up the desktop
[09:02] <DreamerHxC> it's freezed
[09:02] <theplatypus> compengi : Do I know what?
[09:02] <DreamerHxC> I just can switch to console or ctrl+alt+backspace
[09:02] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: Using a regex that same command will work for gdm and kdm for gnome or KDE :)
[09:03] <dabaR> theplatypus: try defaults,users,rw in fstab instead of rw, when you feel like trying something else,.
[09:03] <DreamerHxC> ok but it's not working either :(
[09:03] <compengi> theplatypus, how to make ubuntu read files named in russian
[09:03] <Coffeegrindah> anyone know of a good front end for an MP3 encoder? i need to remove VBR from some of my collection
[09:04] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: When you say the dpkg... command did nothing, did it ask you any questions ?
[09:04] <DreamerHxC> no
[09:04] <DreamerHxC> do I try withot -phigh?
[09:05] <Jordan_U> DreamerHxC: That is strange, it should have, but yes, try withought -phigh.
[09:05] <dabaR> theplatypus: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=283131

[09:33] <zainka> Earlier I had (in grub) option for selecting between win2k, grub and Grub secure mode, now there is only alternatives for ubuntu.

[09:34] <OoberMick> DreamerHxC: To be honest if it is working "on and off" the it sounds like a bug in the fglrx or a hardware problem. Either way you can't fix it on the ubuntu chanel :/
[09:34] <ubuntu_istanbul> zever do you have any idea
[09:34] <zainka> Computer statrs correctly, it is youst that it wont give option on accessing partition 1 (NTFS win2k)

[09:38] <melon> is it possible to create a launcher on desktop that will open up terminal with an action invoked? eg: starting irssi in terminal
[09:38] <DreamerHxC> OoberMick I don't think so
[09:38] <Rav|strangler> kk
[09:38] <justin_> melon: Yes, what WM/DE are you using?
[09:38] <DreamerHxC> It works properly on windows
[09:38] <Rav|strangler> because I can't install it because of it
[09:39] <DreamerHxC> maybe Radeon 9550 sucks in ubuntu
[09:39] <variant> melon: yes, gnome-terminal -e commandname
[09:39] <justin_> melon: All you have to do is create a new desktop shortcut -- and in the executable field type --- irssi, it will load in your default terminal.

[09:40] <ebaad> hello can somebody help me with ftp setup
[09:40] <justin_> melon: It changes per desktop system, should be easy to do in Gnome or KDE again simply create a new desktop shortcut, however if your in Flux or another minimal WM.. well its a little bit more complicated
[09:40] <josh_> anyone?
[09:41] <ubuntu_istanbul> <DreamerHxC>
[09:41] <justin_> josh_: What do you mean "boot off linux" ?
[09:41] <DreamerHxC> ubuntu_istanbul yeah?

[09:41] <josh_> or dxmcp
[09:42] <josh_> what do i need?
[09:42] <justin_> josh_: I suggest you look for the info on the net, cause thats going to be complicated -- too complicated to explain in a few lines on IRC.

[09:45] <DreamerHxC> ok so who's got a solution for me? :)
[09:45] <mc44> zainka: use a browser
[09:45] <bieb> emilia.. what are you trying to do on that computer?
[09:45] <justin_> emilia: You have to give the folders /group permissions
[09:46] <FluxD> hello I am trying to install Edgy, I am logged on as the livecd user now when I reach the part where it says about paritioning I dont have an option where ubuntu partitions the hd, all I see are erase hd, manual partition and something else
[09:46] <justin_> FluxD: Go to "manual" partitioning.
[09:46] <emilia> bieb : make a folder people can dump on, its the work burnstation
[09:46] <bieb> use manual partition
[09:46] <Jowi> Hoxx, you can also copy the fonts you wish to use to either /home/yourname/.fonts/ or /usr/share/fonts/truetype/artistic/ (for example)
[09:46] <FluxD> justin_ doesnt gparted do that?
[09:46] <OoberMick> DreamerHxC: can you pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log the next time X fails to start
[09:46] <bieb> emilia.. do you have Samba running?
[09:46] <justin_> FluxD: If you let Ubuntu do it automatically, it deletes everything
[09:47] <emilia> bieb : yeah
[09:47] <emilia> bieb : i see it on the domain, it shows up
[09:47] <bieb> have you set the users allowed to connect to it?
[09:47] <FluxD> justin_: In dapper it had an option to resize
[09:47] <emilia> bieb : how do i do that?
[09:47] <CharlieSu> what is the difference between shadow and shadow- ?
[09:47] <emilia> bieb : can i set it so anyone can ?
[09:47] <kitche> FluxD: that's what manual partition is for
[09:47] <zainka> mc44: um, i see, it should be there now
[09:47] <justin_> FluxD: Yup it did, but I think they changed it to fix problems with partitioning that occured on Dapper.
[09:48] <DreamerHxC> OoberMick X never fails to start
[09:48] <mc44> zainka: paste the URL it gave you here
[09:48] <justin_> emilia: Change your folder's group permissions.
[09:48] <Hoxx> Jowi: ok tnx
[09:48] <emilia> justin_ : my home folder?
[09:48] <bieb> emilia... If it is not a security issue, create one user that can access the dump share..
=== denis_napast is now known as Zero_Cool
[09:48] <FluxD> kitche, justin_: thanks so I choose manual then what?
[09:48] <justin_> emilia: You should not be sharing your home folder as a whole, but I suppose yes -- and change the permissions for users and groups.
=== Zero_Cool is now known as Zero_Code
[09:48] <OoberMick> DreamerHxC: so what happens then?
[09:49] <bieb> after that user is created and has a password, then.. at the CLi,,, smbpasswd -a <username>
[09:49] <justin_> FluxD: Yes, or else you will have to delete everything and let Ubuntu do it manually.

[09:53] <Zero_Code> Which session recorder I should use on Ubuntu
[09:54] <justin_> ebaad: Seems like your server is running on another port other then 21 ;) -- clients usually try 21 as the default --
[09:54] <soundray> ebaad: what happens when you 'telnet localhost 21'?
[09:54] <zainka> mc44: Yes, one hdd and partition 1 is for win2k.

[10:02] <DrNick> stalefries, you can do it through the network GUI, or you can manually edit your /etc/resolv.conf file and change the IP addresses in there
[10:02] <soundray> ebaad: well done
[10:02] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:  trying now thanks
[10:02] <ebaad> you guys helped me thanks
[10:02] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:   sudo or user
[10:02] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: what?
[10:02] <DreamerHxC> ubuntu_istanbul when I do "sudo rmmod -f fglrx" it says no such file or directory
[10:02] <stalefries> DrNick: But when I change it in the GUI tool, it gets changed back whenever I connect to a different access point
[10:02] <tobster> Hi
[10:03] <abyssmal> hi tobster
[10:03] <mc44> zainka: ok, well after you have done that, you cab just reboot and windows should be there
[10:03] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:  should i do it under root or user  or does it matter because im working on the users firefox
[10:03] <tobster> Im having real issues
[10:03] <ubuntu_istanbul> ok.
[10:03] <badock> hi all
[10:03] <abyssmal> hi
[10:03] <DrNick> stalefries, thats cos it gets new info from DHCP. if you use DHCP there is no way to stop it getting the DNS info for that interface I dont think
[10:03] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: if you open the terminal as the user, you can type exactly what I wrote.
[10:03] <abyssmal> anyone know about the madwifi drivers?
[10:03] <tobster> If I buy a printer how do i know it going to work?
[10:03] <ubuntu_istanbul> you will pass  "sudo rmmod -f fglrx" this code
[10:03] <stalefries> DrNick: bah. Ok, thanks
[10:03] <DreamerHxC> it's not working
[10:03] <ubuntu_istanbul> write the next code
[10:03] <ubuntu_istanbul> ok
[10:03] <soundray> tobster: check linuxprinting.org before you buy
[10:03] <tobster> yeah
[10:04] <tobster> i have
[10:04] <soundray> tobster: or get a Postscript printer
[10:04] <badock> scuse me, do you know an app which can read (not necessarly edit) .ppt, which is NOT openoffice ?
[10:04] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:   sorry dumb question
[10:04] <DreamerHxC> and modprobe fglrx sais ERror install commando for fglrx
[10:04] <DrNick> stalefries, you could create a sample resolv.conf file and make a script which replaces your current one with it, then you'd just have to run that each time to save you editing it
[10:04] <tobster> all the low cost ones seem to be discontinued
[10:04] <soundray> tobster: or check turboprint.de
[10:04] <tobster> turboprint that a new one thanks
[10:04] <zainka> mc44: Sorry but no... It still complains aboute the password, have tried several which i actual know is wrong, but you know.. However, should i perhaps use sudo in stead of gksu
[10:04] <stalefries> DrNick: nah, that's too much work
[10:05] <abyssmal> i need to patch my atheros drivers to allow them to go into monitor mode
[10:05] <DrNick> stalefries, ok. it'll be less work than editing it each time, however.
[10:05] <DrNick> stalefries, whats the matter with other DNS servers anyway?
[10:05] <stalefries> DrNick: I just won't bother
[10:05] <tobster> I have another question if i buy any kind of hardware say a wireless mouse how will i know it will work
[10:05] <mc44> zainka: yep, try it, it should make no difference
[10:05] <soundray> tobster: it's payware, but it was worth it for me. I got an unsupported printer as a substitute for the one I ordered, because they were out of stock. With turboprint, it works.
[10:05] <tobster> is the plug and play pretty sound on Ubuntu?
[10:05] <stalefries> DrNick: it's OpenDNS, it's got some nice feature like .tld spell checking
[10:05] <soundray> tobster: USB? yes.
[10:05] <tobster> cool
[10:06] <tobster> thanks
[10:06] <DrNick> i see
[10:06] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:   restarted check the about:plugins  still says 4.0
[10:06] <CablD_Ubuntu> rrr
[10:06] <ubuntu_istanbul> i edit my answer.
[10:06] <tsoler> hello to all
[10:06] <ubuntu_istanbul> <DreamerHxC> ok.
[10:06] <stalefries> !hi | tsoler
[10:06] <ubotu> tsoler: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[10:06] <ubuntu_istanbul> hi
[10:06] <tobster> i read that you dont need drivers like you do in Windows cus Ubuntu is pretty much all plug and play
[10:06] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: okay, for some strange reason, it's not finding the plugin. Let's check a few things: are you on amd64 or on regular i386?
[10:07] <Tomcat_> tobster: You do need drivers (called "Kernel modules"), but not like in Windows, correct.
[10:07] <tsoler> does anyone here knows where i can find help for mapserver
[10:07] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:  amd64
[10:07] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: okay, that explains everything.
[10:07] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray: btw  thanks!
[10:07] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:  great
[10:07] <Tomcat_> tobster: imho, plug&play in Linux is much better than in Windows.
[10:07] <Yasutoko> Hi everyone.. Got a problem here with my Ubuntu install...
[10:07] <beasty> lol ?
[10:07] <kingace> hello
[10:08] <Chris_Swift> !ask | Yasutoko
[10:08] <ubotu> Yasutoko: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:08] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: you need to go to the forums, find the instructions from Kilz and install a 32bit firefox version. Then it'll work. It does here. (amd64, too)
[10:08] <zainka> mc44: but it does, im in, and file is saved. Thanks a lot. Many greetings to you and Good bless
[10:08] <kingace> whenever I try to upgrade to edgy, I get failed to fetch errors.. this is using the update manager. any suggestions?
[10:08] <DreamerHxC> ubuntu_istanbul I replied to you in the post
[10:08] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray: darn  ok thanks!!  alot for your time  will do now
[10:08] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: found it: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
[10:08] <mc44> zainka: no problmes, if it doesnt work come back and shout at me
[10:09] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray: do i need to uninstall the x64 version i have now?
[10:09] <zainka> mc44: No need for shouting... bye
[10:09] <Yasutoko> Well look, I've just gotten in my Live cd & Installation disc , now, when I insert my live cd, reboot, everything does what it's supposed to do!... Buuut.. At the final inning, it crashes and my xserver can't go further.. ( graphical interface thing ) ..
[10:09] <tobster> Thanks guys  prob see you in the forum were I tend to help others
[10:09] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: no, you can run both in parallel, but you have to make sure you know which is which ;)
[10:09] <Chris_Swift> Tried Safe Graphics mode?
[10:10] <Yasutoko> Chris_Swift , you talking to me?
[10:10] <Chris_Swift> yes
[10:10] <ubuntu_istanbul> what is your (uname -r)
[10:10] <ubuntu_istanbul> <DreamerHxC>
[10:10] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:   I think i can run with the ball from here  Thank You for your support  ... this is the reason I changed all my puters to Ubuntu
[10:10] <Yasutoko> Well... No... I don't know how to ...
[10:10] <tobster> Tomcat but the drivers are pre-installed right?
[10:10] <Tomcat_> tobster: Most are, yes.
[10:11] <soundray> CablD_Ubuntu: glad I could be of some help
[10:11] <Chris_Swift> When you put in the LiveCD a menu comes up to select how you want to load/boot Ubuntu, use the arrow keys to go down and select Safe Graphics mode
[10:11] <CablD_Ubuntu> soundray:  =P
[10:11] <ubuntu_istanbul> DreamerHxC
[10:11] <tobster> so how safe is it to buy hardware for Ubuntu?
[10:11] <Yasutoko> Okay Chris, gonna try that
[10:11] <Tomcat_> tobster: Best is to find stuff in some hardware database that will say it works in Linux.
[10:11] <Chris_Swift> if not come back ok
[10:11] <Yasutoko> Just inserted my live cd
[10:11] <Yasutoko> Yep
[10:12] <Yasutoko> Btw : V5.1 ( when live prompt loads when cd is inserted... Is that the latest? .. <= live )
[10:12] <tobster> im thinking maybe i should install windows along side Ubuntu just so i can use it to install drivers that how i got my modem to work
[10:12] <tobster> any ways thanks
[10:12] <DrNick> hey, in general i've found the hardware support in ubuntu to be excellent. does anyone know the deal with RAID controllers though? Most onboard ones on standard PC motherboards aren't true hardware RAID I know, just wondered if Ubuntu supports many of them?
[10:12] <Chris_Swift> Yasutoko: 6.10 is thw latest
[10:13] <Yasutoko> Bah... Stuck with an older live :p
[10:13] <Chris_Swift> lol, dont worry
[10:13] <soundray> DrNick: not to dive into a general discussion pro/con RAID, if you do do it, you're usually better off doing software RAID if you have a reasonably fast CPU.
[10:14] <Yasutoko> Hmmm.. Sooo.. i inserted my Live cd Chris, but there is no where were I can select what kind of boot load I want : This is what I see
[10:14] <tobster> To be honest I have not had a problem apart from the printer issue
[10:14] <tobster> bye
[10:14] <landexem_> When I try and burn an audio CD with K3b from a bunch of MP3 files it gives me an error saying "Unable to handle the following files due to an unsupported format"
[10:14] <landexem_> What package to I need for K3b to decode these MP3s?
[10:14] <Yasutoko> Ubuntu 5.10 Live , OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Gaim, TheOpenCd
[10:15] <Chris_Swift> You have to boot off the CD and not Windows to the CD
[10:15] <Yasutoko> Okay... Lets try that then, brb :)
[10:15] <DrNick> soundray, I still prefer hardware RAID, even if its not true hardware RAID if possible, as it has the huge advantage that it's OS independant. plus with software RAID, if you system disk dies you're still stuck, with hardware RAID thats not the case. I just wondered what the support was like for them
[10:16] <fbc> does someone know how to prevent nm-applet from running on startup?
[10:16] <Sparx> If im using an dell xps 400 should i have to alter anything in the BIOS in order for ubuntu to run?
[10:16] <fbc> Sparx:  not generally.
[10:17] <Sparx> well, during start up it crashes
[10:17] <n3rdism> sparx: like how?
[10:17] <DrNick> Sparx, any errors?
[10:17] <tonyyarusso> Vspirit: Did you get an answer about scrolling earlier?
[10:17] <soundray> !bootoptions | Sparx
[10:17] <ubotu> Sparx: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
[10:17] <greghunt> do you have any funky acpi apic stuff going on?
[10:17] <fbc> Sparx:  That probably has nothing to do with the BIOS. What errors are you getting?
[10:17] <fbc> does someone know how to prevent nm-applet from running on startup?
[10:17] <n3rdism> fbc: maybe in /etc/modules?
[10:18] <Sparx> Im not getting an error but when its running the scripts in cuts to this screen where its green
[10:18] <Sparx> and pen-stripped looking
[10:18] <fbc> n3rdism:  hmm, I'll check it
[10:18] <Sparx> sorry im not that advanced
[10:18] <Sparx> thanks n
[10:18] <n3rdism> sparx: sounds like video card archiving
[10:18] <soundray> DrNick: I know that for some of the older motherboard integrated RAIDs from Abit and the like, there was support. But I haven't looked into this for a long time, sry
[10:18] <DrNick> Sparx, sounds like a problem with your graphics system
[10:18] <Sparx> hmm
[10:18] <Sparx> is there a way to fix it
[10:18] <DrNick> soundray, no probs, cheers
[10:18] <n3rdism> sparx: what card are you running?
[10:19] <soundray> fbc: check whether it's started from System-Prefs-Sessions-Startup Programs
[10:19] <Sparx> nvidia gforce 600
[10:19] <Sparx> or 400, one of the two
[10:19] <mabreaux> my bottom bar has vanished, how do I get it back
[10:19] <n3rdism> sparx: try 2 things: 1st, put in the ubuntu disc and if you can get to the menu. try boot from harddrive, if that works: check to make sure your xorg.conf is how it should be
[10:20] <fbc> soundray:  thanks,, that's where I found it...
[10:20] <n3rdism> sparx: second try booting into safemode from grub
[10:20] <n3rdism> sparx: and check xorg.conf from there
[10:20] <soundray> mabreaux: right-click on the top panel, select "New Panel", add the applets you need
[10:20] <fbc> n3rdism:  Thanks for your help too..
[10:20] <n3rdism> fbc: it work?
[10:20] <Sparx> Im sorry how do i check xorg.conf? in the cmd?
[10:20] <soundray> mabreaux: maybe first make sure you haven't just moved it to another place
[10:20] <n3rdism> sparx: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:20] <fbc> n3rdism:  yup soundray gave me the fix.. it was in the session manager...
[10:21] <n3rdism> sparx: prior to changing anything do: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[10:21] <n3rdism> fbc: was gonna have you look there next :) glad to hear its working tho
[10:21] <DreamerHxC1> hi again
[10:21] <fbc> soundray:  I think it's kill my bcm43xx-fwcutter...
[10:22] <mabreaux> thanks
[10:23] <n3rdism> does anyone else feel really fat right about now?
[10:23] <DreamerHxC1> no
[10:23] <DrNick> n3rdism, not particularly
[10:23] <DreamerHxC1> I feel sad and anger
[10:23] <soundray> n3rdism: I've been worse ;)
[10:23] <DreamerHxC1> anger for ubuntu
[10:23] <DreamerHxC1> anger with ati
[10:23] <n3rdism> sad and anger? lol

[10:25] <draeath> does anyone know a good way to convert a manpage into postscipt (to parse through ps2pdf)
[10:25] <jair> hey guys what is the gnome software I can install to copy, burn, data and audio cds on ubuntu.  I tryied k3b but having some issues with it and the cd-drives
[10:25] <n3rdism> jair: gnomebaker
[10:25] <Music_Shuffle> jair, Gnomebacker
[10:25] <Music_Shuffle> baker**
[10:25] <nalioth> jair: or graveman
[10:25] <Chris_Swift_Kubu> lo
[10:25] <jair> thank you all
[10:25] <Panzerboy> hola
[10:25] <jair> thank you very much
[10:25] <axisys> once in a while pages in firefox like youtube looses sound. i close ff, run killall esd and restart ff to get the sound back.. is it a bug?
[10:26] <DrNick> jair, for data CD's, just use the integrated facilities in nautilus. for audio CD's, use serpentine. or you can install Gnome baker, but its pointless really with the other stuff available IMO as it doesn't give you any more options.
[10:26] <Malachi> Hey guys. Man, am I happy to be here.
[10:26] <Music_Shuffle> Hi Malachi
[10:26] <Malachi> Anyways....I'm sure you get this question a lot, but....
[10:26] <draeath> Anyone know of a good audio DSP (esd, arts, etc) that has little-to-no latency? I need under 1/10 second latency
[10:26] <n3rdism> axisys: i get the same problem. but i think it has something to do with the sound driver that flash player chooses to output through
[10:26] <Malachi> After upgrading to Edgy, my multimedia apps crash.
[10:27] <jair> DrNick: I will actually being doing DVD, CD, etc so i need a complete tool instead the included with naitilus
[10:27] <Malachi> I have no idea why; I replaced totem-xine with totem-gstreamer if that helps.
[10:27] <jair> DrNick: but thank you anyway, i am normally a kde guy
[10:27] <DrNick> jair, nautilus does DVD's too
[10:27] <axisys> n3rdism: hmm
[10:27] <jair> DrNick: I will check the options then ;)
[10:27] <compengi> !samba

[10:28] <jair> who need helps with samba
[10:28] <jair> ?
[10:28] <Malachi> n3rdism: Hold on. Boss is calling.
[10:28] <n3rdism> lol
[10:28] <DrNick> jair, just drag what you want on the DVD into the burner folder, chuck in a blank DVD and record away :)
[10:28] <jair> DrNick: yes sounds easy
[10:28] <Nayru> Hi, ive been having trouble installing Ubuntu on my system. When booting from the disk, I select "Install Ubuntu" and it does some loading and then it stops and gives me an graphical X error something about going to http://wiki.x.org to get the latest version of something...I have no clue whats going on...
[10:28] <jair> interesting
[10:28] <ubuntu_istanbul> DreamerHxC
[10:28] <Malachi> n3rdism: Sorry, I have to work. Didn't mean to cause any trouble.
[10:29] <n3rdism> malachi: no worries
[10:29] <soundray> simmerz: you need libncurses-dev, I believe
[10:29] <simmerz> ok
[10:29] <ubuntu_istanbul> DreamerHxC1
[10:29] <soundray> simmerz: have you read the forum/wiki stuff about kernel compiling?
[10:29] <DrNick> i should really cut my nails. brb....

[10:30] <n3rdism> haha same
[10:30] <n3rdism> nayru: what kind of system are you running?
[10:30] <soundray> Nayru: you may need a boot option like vga=771
[10:30] <Sp4rKy> hi
[10:30] <Nayru> Dell XPS, Windows XP
[10:30] <soundray> Nayru: there are help screens explaining how to set boot options
[10:30] <Sp4rKy> please, is there ASM editor with syntaxing coloration ?
[10:31] <n3rdism> nayru: try what soundray said, or "graphical safe mode"
[10:31] <bieb> ASM?
[10:31] <abyssmal> hello
[10:31] <abo_> I have a process apt-index-watch  running taking lots of the cpu power in a periodic way, a kind of Dirac Comb
[10:32] <soundray> !nasm-mode | Sp4rKy
[10:32] <ubotu> nasm-mode: NASM mode for XEmacs. In component universe, is extra. Version 20020330 (edgy), package size 5 kB, installed size 112 kB

[10:32] <n3rdism> abo: thats actually a bug
[10:32] <jair> hey guys I am trying to create an audio cd using a list of mp3s does gnomebacker convert them on the fly from mp3-wav?
[10:32] <DrNick> back
[10:33] <abo_> n3rdism, any fix?
[10:33] <|dam|> please advise me on how to stop my window from dissappearing when i minimize. Thank you in advance
[10:33] <n3rdism> abo: reading, google "apt-index-watch" the bugs come up
[10:33] <mc44> |dam|: dissapearing?
[10:34] <|dam|> yes
[10:34] <jair> Music_Shuffle: hey quick question, I installed and I am on the wizard, telling the app to burn an audio CD but did not find anything, it looks like is trying to get an .wav when i have all mp3s
[10:34] <mc44> |dam|: do you have a panel at the bottom of the screen? (this is ubuntu right?)
[10:34] <jair> Music_Shuffle: the app, does not convert them on the fly? from mp3-wav?
[10:35] <Music_Shuffle> Which, Gnomebaker?
[10:35] <jair> yes
[10:35] <DrNick> jair, chuck the mp3's into a playlist in rhythmbox and hit the burn to CD button. else use serpentine, that accepts mp3
[10:35] <|dam|> mc44: yes i do
[10:35] <Sparx> n3rdism where do i go to type in all he info you just tole me about xorg? im using windows right now
[10:35] <Music_Shuffle> I've never used it actually, I just know it works...I use k3b on both KDE and Gnome all the time, sorry. >_<
[10:35] <jair> DrNick: ohhh interesting then the gnome backer is not as intelligent as k3b
[10:35] <n3rdism> sparx: in the terminal for ubuntu
[10:35] <Sparx> where is that?
[10:35] <mc44> |dam|: right click on it, choose Add to Panel
[10:35] <soundray> Sp4rKy: normal emacs has an asm mode as well
[10:36] <DrNick> jair, GNOME baker is rubbish, i dont like it. the usual tools included in nautilus and the auto apps work nicely enough
[10:36] <mc44> |dam|: then add "Window List"
[10:36] <jair> DrNick: so I will have to use it with the other application and burn it
[10:36] <|dam|> mc44: and yes this is ubuntu
[10:36] <Sp4rKy> soundray: k thx :)
[10:36] <jair> \so ok, let me use the naitilus one then
[10:36] <n3rdism> sparx: if you're in the GUI go Applications > Accessories >Terminal
[10:36] <saturnine> hello
[10:36] <jair> DrNick: I will select all teh mp3 files and say "record" ?
[10:36] <DrNick> jair, for audo discs, use either rhythmbox, if you use that, or serpentine, as i said
[10:36] <mabreaux> |dam|: hello
[10:36] <Sparx> but i cant do that because im on windows
[10:37] <silya> Hi all! I have install ubuntu, but there is only memtest and my winxp in grub menu :/
[10:37] <|dam|> mabreaux: turkey
[10:37] <saturnine> is there someone here who is willing to answer a couple of questions for someone who just finished installing ubuntu on their computer?
[10:37] <slavik> anyone know why Azureus doesn't put up a tray icon?
[10:37] <jair> DrNick: ohhh I see
[10:37] <slavik> saturnine: just ask :)
[10:37] <DrNick> jair, load up serpentine, and its all pretty self-explanitory
[10:37] <mc44> |dam|: did that work?
[10:37] <|dam|> mabreaux: yep
[10:37] <abyssmal> im having problems with ubuntu drivers, can someone help me?
[10:37] <soundray> silya: what version of ubuntu?
[10:37] <simmerz> right, that works fine, now, but I'm getting an error trying to compile the hostap-source
[10:37] <Sparx> im on windows, if that helps
[10:38] <slavik> abyssmal: can you be more specific please?

[10:38] <abyssmal> i need help installing madwifi for my atheros wireless adapter
[10:38] <silya> Fresh from IDF
[10:38] <silya> in Kiev
[10:38] <saturnine> TY...  I installed ubuntu today, and need to do some configuration of the graphics driver.  I downloaded the driver for my ATI Card and installed it, but now I need to change something called xorg.conf  what is that and how do I change it?
[10:38] <jair> DrNick: ok
[10:38] <slavik> silya: zdorova
[10:38] <soundray> silya: can you try things out while we chat?
[10:38] <[g2] > anybody know how to change the default boot seletion in rEFIt from Mac OS X to Edgy (Edgy boots on sda3)
[10:39] <DreamerHxC1> can somebody help me to install fglrx with my ATI? i can't make it work
[10:39] <grimeboy> What's the name of that command line tool for converting text formats?
[10:39] <slavik> abyssmal: pastebin 'lsmod | sort' output please
[10:39] <silya> No :)
[10:39] <slavik> !pastebin
[10:39] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)

[10:39] <ubuntu_istanbul> hi <DreamerHxC
[10:39] <Nayru> Hello im back, I think i need some more help
[10:39] <DreamerHxC1> hi
[10:39] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: did you follow the wiki page?
[10:39] <bieb> I am having a software raid issue....
[10:39] <soundray> grimeboy: you must be joking, there are hundreds
[10:39] <ubuntu_istanbul> i ask you what is your uname -r
[10:39] <abyssmal> !pastebin
[10:39] <DreamerHxC1> slavik yes
[10:39] <bieb> I have an old Dell Dimension, I have 1 ide HDD for the OS, and 2 IDE HDDs that I want to put in Raid1 to backup some files from my home PC,
[10:39] <bieb> I have installed 6.06 from the alternate CD, and setup the Raid on those 2 drives, but when Ubuntu loads, they are not in Raid or mounted or formatted
[10:39] <abyssmal> ??
[10:39] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: on edgy?
[10:39] <DreamerHxC1> but when I do fglrxinfo
[10:39] <DreamerHxC1> it takes a while
[10:40] <DreamerHxC1> and it shows mesa3d
[10:40] <DreamerHxC1> not ATI
[10:40] <DreamerHxC1> yes
[10:40] <grimeboy> soundray, Right, tell me a simple one included in ubuntu by default.
[10:40] <DrNick> I think the graphical display settings tool from red hat should definetly be included in the next release. its open source so there for the taking, and would save a lot of confusing with people having to edit xorg.conf to set up things like dual-head.
[10:40] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: did you blacklist the fglrx module that comes from restricted drivers?
[10:40] <silya> slavik, privet!
[10:40] <DreamerHxC1> hum
[10:40] <soundray> grimeboy: gee, do you always order people around like that?
[10:40] <abyssmal> what about a pastebin??
[10:40] <jair> DrNick: I think that serpentine is already on the system, now i can not find any icon on ubuntu to start it :(
[10:40] <Nayru> I still cant get the ubuntu cd to install, same "server x" error and when i diagnose the last line is an error that sais "PCI Mach64 in slot 1:0:0 could not be defined!"
[10:40] <n3rdism> dreamerhxc1: did you read the howto? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:40] <ubuntu_istanbul> DreamerHxC1 dou you hear me.
[10:41] <DreamerHxC1> Make sure you unload the module ati-agp by issuing "sudo rmmod ati-agp" and blacklist it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist. <== is it?
[10:41] <slavik> abyssmal: do 'lsmod | sort' in terminal, then go to the site in !pastebin factoid, and post the output there
[10:41] <grimeboy> soundray, Sorry, I read that and it was in the wrong tone totally. But do you know of one?
[10:41] <DreamerHxC1> ubuntu_istanbul yes I hear you
[10:41] <|dam|> mc44: i unfortunately have to go eat a turkey i'll be back 7:00pm pct.Thanks so far for your help
[10:41] <DreamerHxC1> yes I read the howtos
[10:41] <soundray> grimeboy: from what to what are you trying to convert?
[10:41] <mc44> |dam|: happy thanksgiving! my american friend :p
[10:41] <grimeboy> soundray, windows to unix
[10:41] <abyssmal> lsmod |sort
[10:41] <ubuntu_istanbul> what is uname -r
[10:41] <jair> DrNick: nevermind I got it
[10:41] <prestosd> When I shutdown, the computer works fine until its completely done. Then the splash screen freezes and the HDs shut off but the splash screen is still at 0 (done) and it never turns off. Can anyone help me?
[10:41] <DrNick> jair, under Sound & Video?
[10:41] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: have you tried 'sudo modprobe fglrx' (to load the fglrx module)
[10:41] <DrNick> ok lol
[10:41] <Nayru> =/
[10:42] <DreamerHxC1> yes I tried
[10:42] <n3rdism> ubuntu_istanbul: prints version
[10:42] <jair> haha
[10:42] <ubuntu_istanbul> 2.6.17-10-generic
[10:42] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: does it load or give any errors?
[10:42] <n3rdism> kernel version
[10:42] <grimeboy> grimeboy, I remember there being a command like win2unix or something, but I can't find it.
[10:42] <abyssmal> im not particularly having trouble with that actual installation process more, more just which release i need and where to get it
[10:42] <ubuntu_istanbul> mine is 2.6.17-10-generic
[10:42] <ubuntu_istanbul> what is yoursa
[10:42] <grimeboy> Ah, I mean soundray
[10:42] <Francesco_> salve
[10:42] <soundray> grimeboy: dos2unix from the tofrodos package
[10:42] <DrNick> grimeboy, yes its unix2dos, I belive. there's also a dos2unix to go the other way
[10:42] <n3rdism> same but 386
[10:42] <grimeboy> soundray, Dos, not windows, thanks.
[10:42] <jair> DrNick: I think that guys don't understand what do I want to accomplish, the freaking serpentine does not support mp3 files :(
[10:43] <jair> forget it I go with k3b and kde
[10:43] <silya> soundray, but I can told you about anything you want
[10:43] <slavik> !restricted
[10:43] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[10:43] <DreamerHxC1> slavik it says: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist: ignoring bad line starting with ati-agp (which I wrote). FATAL: Module fglrx not found
[10:43] <silya> and after all can reboot and try something
[10:43] <Nayru> Is there a topic on the forums or anywhere that can help with installation issues like X server...?
[10:43] <DrNick> jair, serpentine DOES support mp3 files. heck it'd be pretty much useless otherwise
[10:43] <mirak> hey
[10:43] <abyssmal> slavik, have you had to use mad wifi?
[10:43] <slavik> abyssmal: no :(
[10:43] <mirak> does anyone know how to build custom debs with pbuilder ?
[10:43] <abyssmal> hrm
[10:43] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: tell me what 'lsmod | sort | grep fglrx' prints
[10:44] <soundray> silya: when you get to the grub menu, you can start an interactive grub session with 'c'
[10:44] <Nayru> :*(
[10:44] <brett_> How to allow user/ to be able to mount another drive?  I am trying to make link to a HDD for a user on KDE.
[10:44] <abyssmal> its been giving me a headache since last night, i couldn't get it to work on my redhat linux... so i opted to just go ahead and install ubuntu
[10:44] <abyssmal> .. now my wireless card WORKS!! YAY!!
[10:44] <abyssmal> but i doesnt go into monitor mode .. :(
[10:44] <slavik> abyssmal: wtf?! roflcakes :P
[10:44] <silya> btw, when I boot from this live CD there is several problems: 1 I can't make manual lan configuration; 2 when installation complete cd ejects but after pressing Enter PC stops
[10:44] <soundray> silya: in there, you can type 'help' or 'help command' for help. You need to set a root partition with 'root (hd0,1)'
[10:44] <abyssmal> turns out i like ubuntu better
[10:44] <slavik> abyssmal: maybe the driver doesn't support it? (an older version maybe?)
[10:45] <DreamerHxC1> agpgart 34888 2 fglrx,nvidia_agp and in other line fglrx 406988 19
[10:45] <soundray> silya: (hd0,1) is the same as /dev/hda2 (not hda1!)
[10:45] <DrNick> abyssmal, good :)
[10:45] <n3rdism> mirak, did you read through the documentation about packaging?
[10:45] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf please
[10:45] <kikokos> hi
[10:45] <abyssmal> no, well.. i found a website with the patch that i need, but i need a password to download it cuz other sites were linking to it and sucking up his bandwidth
[10:45] <abyssmal> but he must have gotten the patches from somewhere else, cuz its not a programmer's website
[10:45] <soundray> silya: then you need to set a kernel, most likely with 'kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-10-generic root=/dev/hda2' (replace the correct root device)
[10:45] <abyssmal> so i need to go to elsewhere to find it
[10:45] <mathrick> hi, I have problems with my microphone, can't get it to work. The microphone itself works (I've tried), but I can't get any sound recorded. Soundcard is SB Audigy LS, and I had it working before with breezy, but it broke after I reinstalled, and didn't get back to work after upgrading to Edgy
[10:45] <slicky> anyone know how to get the 3d accleration woring with a ATI radeon video card and the xorg thingy?
[10:46] <slavik> abyssmal: try asking people in #kismet ...
[10:46] <slavik> slicky: where are you having trouble?
[10:46] <abyssmal> ahah.. good idea
[10:46] <sn9> slicky: depends on which radeon
[10:46] <mirak> n3rdism: not everything, I just want to build lib-xine patched with vdr patches, but I can't install build-deps, they are broken, so I use pbuilder
[10:46] <slavik> abyssmal: or find the irc channel for the driver ...
[10:46] <soundray> silya: then 'initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-10-generic'
[10:46] <slicky> sn9:  radeon 9600 xt
[10:46] <kikokos> I have on my comp ocaml and I want to burn it on cd and give my friends. But he doesnt has net, how to burn ocaml with any dependiences?
[10:46] <mirak> n3rdism: I just want the quick fix
[10:46] <abyssmal> ahah.. perhaps they do have a channel. i didn't even think of that, lol
[10:46] <sn9> slicky: that one should "just work" iirc
[10:46] <soundray> silya: then hit boot. If it works, you then have to reinstall grub
[10:46] <abyssmal> thanks for the help
[10:46] <slicky> slavik: hm.. with the mods n stiff
[10:46] <slavik> slicky: I thin the ati module should work ...
[10:47] <n3rdism> mirak: i was planning on reading through that soon. wanted to know if you had already to see if it was worth it =)
[10:47] <slavik> slicky: Beryl?
[10:47] <JDahl> what is the package I need to run 32bit programs on 64bit platforms?  I would like to use Skype under AMD64,  and installing Ubuntu in 32bit mode is not an option
[10:47] <n3rdism> mirak: but im not experienced in pbuilder
[10:47] <Nayru> Can someone PLZ help me, im having trouble installing ubuntu from the live cd, when selecting to install it gives me an X server error
[10:47] <kikokos> I have on my comp ocaml and I want to burn it on cd and give my friends. But he doesnt has net, how to burn ocaml with any dependiences?
[10:47] <soundray> JDahl: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
[10:47] <DreamerHxC1> slavik I cant paste because im at other PC but I can write it manually
[10:47] <kikokos> please tell me
[10:47] <BlueEagle> nayru: Did you try the failsafe VGA mode?
[10:47] <Nayru> yes
[10:47] <JDahl> soundray, thanks
[10:48] <soundray> Nayru: you've had a few suggestions. Say what you've tried
[10:48] <BlueEagle> nayru: Can you be more spesific as to the nature of the error? (hint /var/log/)
[10:48] <prestosd> When I shutdown, the computer works fine until its completely done. Then the splash screen freezes and the HDs shut off but the splash screen is still at 0 (done) and it never turns off. Can anyone help me?
[10:48] <Nayru> Tried different VGA modes
[10:48] <slicky> slavik: sudo modprobe fglrx gives the output : FATAL: Error running install command for fglrx
[10:48] <Nayru> yeah "PCI Mach64 in slot 1:0:0 cound not be defined!"
[10:48] <n3rdism> slicky: that seems to be a ongoing trend lately with fglrx lol
[10:48] <slavik> slicky: did you build the kernel module? it's the stuff with module-assistant in the wiki page
[10:49] <anto> can somone help me
[10:49] <BlueEagle> nayru: Hva you got an integrated and one external (ie. PCI) graphics card?
[10:49] <slicky> slavik: yes.. i did..
[10:49] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: your Ubuntu system, does it have any graphics whatso ever?
[10:49] <sn9> prestosd: sounds like an acpi problem to me
[10:49] <apokryphos> !helpme
[10:49] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:49] <soundray> Nayru: interesting... Is your hardware okay?
[10:49] <slavik> slicky: did you do sudo depmod?
[10:49] <Nayru> ATI x850
[10:49] <Nayru> radeon
[10:49] <anto> i'm using proftpd and i want to setup a user with password and can delete/write/edit files
[10:49] <slicky> slavik:  yepp
[10:49] <Nayru> yup everything works fine
[10:49] <silya> soundray, thx a lot. I know this steps :) More intresting for me WHY installation program make such things
[10:49] <slicky> slavik:  i did follow the guide..
[10:49] <DrNick> oh actually thats one thing i meant to ask - installed GLX, made the startup scripts and ran it on a different display, it didn't pick up the GNOME theme engine :( any ideas?
[10:49] <BlueEagle> nayru: Have you got an integrated and one external (ie. PCI) graphics card?
[10:49] <slicky> n3rdism: are the drivers buggy?
[10:49] <slavik> slicky: what driver are you using in xorg.conf?
[10:49] <Nayru> PCI
[10:50] <silya> Why I can't make manual lan configuration
[10:50] <n3rdism> nayru: step one, toss ati in garbage. step 2: buy an nvidia card. step 3: sleep better at night
[10:50] <slavik> DrNick: Beryl?
[10:50] <anto> i'm using proftpd and i want to setup a user with password and can delete/write/edit files
[10:50] <Nayru> PCIE sorry
[10:50] <Nayru> lol
[10:50] <n3rdism> slicky: ati is just weak
[10:50] <slicky> slavik:  right now: OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
[10:50] <prestosd> sn9: so what should i do?
[10:50] <DreamerHxC1> slavik do I have to install module-assistant build-essential in order to get fglrx to work?
[10:50] <DrNick> slavik, not tried Beryl no, i've heard its not as good or something
[10:50] <slavik> DrNick: add 'gnome-settings-daemon' to the current session
[10:50] <slicky> slavik:  was that the info u wanted? :$
[10:50] <sn9> prestosd: what kind of motherboard is it?
[10:50] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: to build kernel modules, yes
[10:50] <BlueEagle> nayru: It would really, really help us help you if you took the time and effort to answer in complete sentences and included the name of the person you were writing to...
[10:50] <silya> Why when I set 1024x768 32 bit options on live cd boot menu. this setting don't saved and pc boot 1280x1024
[10:50] <silya> WhyWhyWhy
[10:51] <prestosd> dunno
[10:51] <mathrick> is there anything I could use to monitor all inputs on the soundcard? Hacking around switching inputs in the mixer is a bit tiresome already, and then I still have to play with soundrecorder's settings
[10:51] <DrNick> slavik, excellent, i'll try that ta
[10:51] <DreamerHxC1> I don't know how to do that
[10:51] <soundray> Nayru: mach64 cards work well in my experience. You could try putting it in a different PCI slot.
[10:51] <slavik> slicky: well, we know that fglrx isn't working as it should
[10:51] <al1> i just installed ubuntu but i don't feel the benefits comparing to windows
[10:51] <sn9> prestosd: is it a brand-name computer of some kind?
[10:51] <slavik> slicky: did you blacklist fglrx in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules ?
[10:51] <silya> Yes, I agree. Ubuntu - cool desktop, but sometimes easy - not so good
[10:51] <prestosd> sn9, YES it's a Dell XPS T-450
[10:51] <mc44> al1: it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside :)
[10:51] <jared> Hi im trying to install flash and im new to ubuntu
[10:51] <DreamerHxC1> I think i have tthe same problem than slicky
[10:52] <slavik> al1: here's a benefit, if Canonical desides to stop supporting Ubuntu, there is still us ...
[10:52] <al1> i think ubuntu will lead me to the dark side of the force
[10:52] <n3rdism> silya: from my experience anything you do in the live cd as far as settings and programs you install. things like that, dont stay when you boot the actual harddrive
[10:52] <jared> flash player 8 or 9
[10:52] <kikokos> how to make package with any dependings?
[10:52] <kikokos> ex pakcage ocaml
[10:52] <silya> And this is a good example when all Installation process hidden like in win(tm) - not good
[10:52] <sn9> prestosd: xps? one of those pentium2 deals?
[10:52] <soundray> silya: people come here to get fixes and workarounds for your problem. If you're unhappy about how Ubuntu works, report a bug.
[10:52] <slavik> al1: and Ubuntu doesn't phone home like XP or Vista ...

[10:52] <saturnine> I'm too new to all this for some of this to help.  I end up blindly tring comands posted on web sites, and reference to those web sites don;t do much for a non techie user who just wants a working computer.  I would hate to have to go and install windows again.... and I can;t afford a MAC right now.  Is there anyone here who might be willing to help me get my ATI X300 working with 32bit...
[10:52] <slicky> slavik:  hm.. i can only find linux-restricted-modules-common  in that dir
[10:52] <saturnine> ...color depth and the #-D enabled?
[10:52] <saturnine> #-D=3-D
[10:52] <bimberi> jared: download the .deb file from that link above and double-click on it
[10:53] <sn9> prestosd: first thing i'd try would be to add the kernel arg "acpi=force"
[10:53] <slavik> saturnine: what seems to be the trouble?
[10:53] <prestosd> sn9, how do I do that?
[10:53] <silya> soundray, why I cant't say anything bat about this cool distro? I just say my mind and confusion
[10:53] <jared> bimberi i have downloaded this : install_flash_player_7_linux.tar.gz
[10:53] <urmom> if im on a mac how can i setup the keyboard to act normally?
[10:53] <silya> gparted - studpid, tmm
[10:53] <urmom> like it does in macosx
[10:53] <saturnine> When I try to start teh second life program  I get an error where it syas it can't open a window.
[10:54] <silya> 3 times I press back
[10:54] <bimberi> jared: forget it for now and try this method
[10:54] <saturnine> If I check the log it says to check the color depth.
[10:54] <slicky> slavik:  kk done
[10:54] <soundray> silya: because this is the wrong place for that kind of thing. So please stop.
[10:54] <saturnine> WARNING: Unable to create window, be sure screen is set at 32-bit color in Control Panels->Display->Settings

[10:54] <jared> ?
[10:54] <soundray> !anyone
[10:54] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[10:54] <n3rdism> saturnnine: lol its making up menus
[10:54] <kikokos> hi could somebod help me????
[10:55] <sn9> prestosd: at the boot screen where it says to press a key to see the boot menu, press it, then press E, arrow down to the kernel line, E again, and add "acpi=force" hitting enter, then B
[10:55] <slavik> !ask
[10:55] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:55] <saturnine> that's helpful...
[10:55] <bimberi> jared: flashplugin-nonfree_9~beta1~seveas1_i386.deb
[10:55] <prestosd> whow
[10:55] <prestosd> sn9, k ill try that.........brb
[10:55] <sethk> saturnine, you'll have desktop configuration somewhere.
[10:55] <n3rdism> saturnine: instead of going and spending a grand on a mac
[10:55] <sn9> urmom: define "normally"
[10:55] <slavik> hmm, I will go write a howto/script for fglrx on edgy ...
[10:55] <sethk> saturnine, exactly where it is on the menus depends on which desktop you run, but it's there.
[10:56] <jared> they all start with gftp
[10:56] <urmom> sn9, as in ctrl click, using the apple key to copy etc
[10:56] <slavik> because the wiki page has all info all thrown about and such ...
[10:56] <saturnine> generic, thee hour old ubuntu default desktop...
[10:56] <bimberi> jared: look above that
[10:56] <DreamerHxC1> need help installing fglrx with my ATI please
[10:56] <n3rdism> saturnine: buy an nvidia card lol
[10:56] <jared> im new to this to is there something special i have to do to get you to see things i write in red?
[10:56] <urmom> sn9, and having shift make the letters capital
[10:56] <mc44> slavik: Applications -> Add/Remove -> choose fglrx, not that hard :p
[10:56] <hanso> hey. the infocenter crashes when I enter the OpenGL section. anyone got a clue?
[10:56] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: hold on, I am about to write a better how to ...
[10:56] <sn9> urmom: that is possible, but really hard to set up, and IMO, not worth it
[10:56] <urmom> well ok
[10:57] <DreamerHxC1> ok ok don't worry
[10:57] <urmom> but there is one important thing
[10:57] <Pavi> whats the cost of normal nvidia card
[10:57] <bimberi> jared: sorry ... it looks like that repository has changed ... i'll see if there's another
[10:57] <slavik> mc44: I have fglrx working with Beryl and can even play WoW on this set up, I am not the one who needs help :P
[10:57] <urmom> sn9, i need shift to actually work
[10:57] <jared> ok ty
[10:57] <slicky> slavik: so.. are there any way to solve this problem?
[10:57] <sn9> urmom: shift always works
[10:57] <NineTeen67Comet> Does anyone have a nice rsync backup URL I can peek at? It has been a few months since I used rsync (Since my Gentoo days) .. but I did like the way it backed stuff up ..
[10:57] <urmom> not for me
[10:57] <sn9> urmom: which mac?
[10:57] <urmom> sn9 when i try to use shift it just doesnt type the letter
[10:58] <urmom> sn9 im using an ibook g4
[10:58] <sn9> urmom: that's really weird
[10:58] <canburak> hi, i come to this channel stating that one of my `cores` stopped working. i found that it is disabled by windows for the sake of power saving. now i woluld like to know how this can be possible on ubuntu
[10:58] <urmom> sn9, well can i fix it?
[10:58] <n3rdism> nineteen67comet not sure about the samba share, but i remember reading about this really slick and easy rsync service these people offered online. i think leo was talking about it
[10:58] <canburak> how can i shutdown one of the cores of a dual core cpu?
[10:59] <Malachi> n3rdism: I'm back, at least for a while.
[10:59] <sn9> urmom: i can't even think of why it would do that; shift works fine on other ppl's ibook g4's
[10:59] <n3rdism> welcome back malachi
[10:59] <silya> enjoy ubuntu or other distro you like! bye all! sawa
[10:59] <urmom> weird
[10:59] <n3rdism> indeed
[10:59] <saturnine> well.  So much for the helpful ubuntu community I heard about.  Telling someone to go out and purchase anothr video card is nothing more than a rude remark
[10:59] <NineTeen67Comet> n3rdism: I'll look a little for online stuff, I've got enough boxes here to handle my own, but it'd be the same syntax I'm assuming.
[10:59] <saturnine> be well those of you with good intentions
[11:00] <bimberi> jared: http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/pool/dapper-seveas/backports/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78~ubuntu1~dapper1_i386.deb
[11:00] <n3rdism> saturnine: hold the phone
[11:00] <NineTeen67Comet> bbiab
[11:00] <mc44> saturnine: if your hardware is not supported what other option is there?
[11:00] <n3rdism> saturnine: i didn't mean that in any sort of rudness first of all. i simply think when it comes to linux, nvidia wins. secondly: when you came in here you were saying you were about to go out and buy a mac
[11:00] <saturnine> It is supposed to be supported.  I just need to know whay all these code words  yo flks use mean.
[11:00] <jared> bimberi: download and then what?
[11:01] <saturnine> No... I said I can;t aford onw so windows may have to win here.
[11:01] <mc44> saturnine: ok. well no one is trying to be rude, people are helping for free :) sorry if it does not always sound like that
[11:01] <bimberi> jared: open it using gdebi (default action with a double-click or open from the firefox download window) and install.
[11:01] <n3rdism> nineteen67comet ill find it, but im pretty sure its just a app running in the background
[11:01] <mirak> I have read docks but can't find how to build a .deb modified with my patches, and pbuilder
[11:01] <soundray> canburak: powernowd should do that for you when the system load is low.
[11:01] <saturnine> I don;t kinow what a xorg.conf is and when I ask, I'm told to go to a non-exestant directory.
[11:01] <jared> bimberi: it sais an older version is available in a software channel... it opened it automatically and im not sure what program it opened in
[11:01] <sn9> saturnine: regardless of what mc44 says, ati CAN work, but ati's own drivers tend to crash
[11:02] <soundray> canburak: next question is probably, how do you check?
[11:02] <saturnine> fine...
[11:02] <soundray> canburak: I don't know, try 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'
[11:02] <mc44> sn9: hey I didnt say it wasnt supported :p
[11:02] <bimberi> jared: yes, that's gdebi and that message is normal, flash 7 is available via ubuntu repositories but this is flash 9
[11:02] <n3rdism> yah! found it
[11:02] <sn9> [14:00:20]  <mc44> saturnine: if your hardware is not supported what other option is there?
[11:02] <mc44> sn9: notice the if :)
[11:02] <n3rdism> rsync.net if anyones interested
[11:03] <mc44> sn9: anyway...
[11:03] <canburak> soundray, you say powernowd does more than frequency scaling, right?
[11:03] <canburak> thats great, i'm checkling that
[11:03] <jared> bimberi: ok so i pressed "install package" and it is installing... anything else i will nedd to do after besides restart my browser (firefox)

[11:03] <saturnine> I think Linux isn;t ready for the desktop of a normal person.  If one needs to learn an entire new profession to use it then it isn;t usable for most people.  Back to windows purgatory for me.

[11:03] <saturnine> thanks anyway

[11:04] <bimberi> jared: nothing else besided restarting firefox

[11:07] <uksprout> hi all..... just a quickie is it possible to mount a drive (NTFS) to get access to the files
[11:07] <jared> bimberi: o ok ty much!
[11:08] <sc0tt> i'm going to switch it to an nvidia card in a sec
[11:08] <sc0tt> :D
[11:08] <bimberi> jared: i'm just letting you know of its existence :)

[11:08] <bieb> jay.. I dont think you can
[11:08] <Francesco_> #ubuntu.it
[11:08] <jared> bimberi: ok thanks a lot
[11:08] <urmom> NOW i have a huge problem
[11:08] <jared> bimberi: bye
[11:08] <bimberi> jared: np, cya :)
[11:08] <redDEADresolve> i like my ATI cards, my laptop has the intergrated 1150. ATI releasing the drivers to the open source community soon
[11:08] <jay> yea its possible to mount ntfs drives
[11:08] <nativow> which library i must install for stdio.h for example?
[11:08] <urmom> the screen keeps flashing after i restarted
[11:08] <n3rdism> jay: sometimes i accidently click the application and it launches 2. this works however there are some services, like msn that dont allow 2 user names to be logged in multiple times and it kicks you off that service
[11:08] <urmom> and the first time i restarted it was flashing colors!
[11:08] <frandavid100> hey guys
[11:08] <DreamerHxC1> slavik did u finished?
[11:08] <sn9> sc0tt: radeon 7000 will work out-of-the-box
[11:08] <canburak> nativow, packages.ubuntu.com has a `search file in packages`

[11:09] <mztriz> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33541/
[11:09] <MikeyMike> lol
[11:09] <frandavid100> any idea of how to make a new screensaver from an existing one?
[11:09] <soundray> nativow: libc6-dev. You probably want the build-essential metapackage
[11:09] <canburak> frandavid100, screensavers are c programs
[11:09] <canburak> (mostly)
[11:10] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: not yet ...
[11:10] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[11:10] <DreamerHxC1> no ptrob
[11:10] <Pabloooo> how can i enable ctrl+alt+f1 console if im running ubuntu 6.10 under vmware server? its not working :(
[11:10] <frandavid100> so, there's no way I can make one without C programming skills :(
[11:10] <abo_> n3rdism, hey , I fixed, if you are still having it, I can show you hi
[11:10] <frandavid100> thanks canburak
[11:10] <soundray> Pabloooo: the key combination may be caught by something else. Try 'sudo chvt 1' in a terminal.
[11:10] <Trixsey> Can I remove totem without having to remove the entire software bundle?
[11:10] <canburak> frandavid100, if the one you want to extend is in c, yes

[11:11] <n3rdism> abo: i wasn't experiencing the issue, but im glad you fixed it. you should notify those in the bug forums about how you fixed it! ;D
[11:11] <abo_> n3rdism, the fix was on a french forum :)
[11:11] <n3rdism> abo: haha i didn't read those because i dont understand any french x.x
[11:11] <uksprout> thanks will read
[11:11] <soundray> Trixsey: which bundle would that be?
[11:12] <Vspirit> anyone with an idea to how I can create shortcuts or remap/reconfigure keys on an english keyboard so they also produce the Danish  characters ?
=== crisp is now known as crisp-
[11:12] <jay> uksprout: go to http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy
[11:12] <n3rdism> abo: it would be generous of you, if you can translate. to do so on the english forums =) it would be a good contribution to the community
[11:12] <soundray> Vspirit: just add the Danish configuration in System-Prefs-Keyboard. There is also a handy panel applet for layout switching
[11:12] <Trixsey> soundray: ubuntu-desktop
[11:13] <abo_> n3rdism, ok I'll do it
[11:13] <mztriz> I had the newest version of beryl (0.1.2) on my laptop but it kept crashing everytime I used gaim. I tried to downgrade to 0.1.0 but I keep getting this error in Beryl...
[11:13] <mztriz> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33541/
[11:13] <n3rdism> abo, awesome. thanks a lot!
[11:13] <abo_> n3rdism, np
[11:13] <soundray> Trixsey: that one is just a metapackage, i.e. it consists entirely of dependencies. No harm in removing it.
[11:13] <Trixsey> I prefer mplayer far more than totem you see.. and totem is my default player
[11:13] <OoberMick> Vspirit: I set a key to be the "compose" key then I can do: compose a e to get 
[11:13] <n3rdism> d(^_^)y
[11:13] <soundray> Trixsey: you can make mplayer the default without uninstalling totem, though
[11:13] <Trixsey> When I remove totem in synpatic it says I'd have to remove the ENTIRE ubuntu-desktop system
[11:13] <Vspirit> soundray: I know about those options. but I wish to keep the English keyboard layout, and I prefer to avoud more clutter in the panel
[11:14] <Trixsey> soundray: no point in having totem though
[11:14] <Trixsey> if I have mplayer
[11:14] <devilsadvocate> Trixsey, ubuntu-desktop is a ghost package
[11:14] <soundray> Trixsey: no, it says you have to remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage. You can safely do that
[11:14] <n3rdism> totem is really pretty useless
[11:14] <OoberMick> Vspirit: then the compose key is the way to go for you :)
[11:14] <Vspirit> OoberMick: also what I had in mind, but how do you do that?
[11:14] <sn9> soundray: not entirely true (re ubuntu-desktop). the meta-packages are needed for dist-upgrade to track dependency changes
[11:14] <Trixsey> devilsadvocate: What do you mean? I want to keep parts of that package :(
[11:15] <Trixsey> I don't want totem, but I want other things in ubuntu-desktop
[11:15] <mztriz> I had the newest version of beryl (0.1.2) on my laptop but it kept crashing everytime I used gaim. I tried to downgrade to 0.1.0 but I keep getting a plugin error.
[11:15] <Pabloooo> soundray: it didnt wok ive already changed the hotkeys combination in vmware server. now when i grab input inside the vm machine i cant see the mouse or user the keyboard :(
[11:15] <n3rdism> this is something we should report as a bug, because i for one dislike totem. and find it completely useless
[11:15] <devilsadvocate> Trixsey, its not a real package. It just has all the others as dependancies. so if you want to install ubunut gnoem, you just have to install one package and it'll pull all the others
[11:15] <n3rdism> maybe they will leave it out in the next release
[11:15] <OoberMick> System->preferences->keyboard. layout options, compose key
[11:15] <sn9> Trixsey: easiest thing to do is to keep totem and not use it
[11:15] <bimberi> Trixsey: it won't remove the other dependencies, just the metapackage
[11:16] <soundray> Pabloooo: sorry, can't really help with vmware probs
[11:16] <devilsadvocate> Trixsey, you can safely remove it. none of your other applications will go
[11:16] <OoberMick> Vspirit: System->preferences->keyboard. layout options, compose key
[11:16] <devilsadvocate> just make sure you arent freeing up more than a few mb when you do it :)
[11:16] <Pabloooo> soundray: ok dont worry thanks! :)
[11:16] <OoberMick> Vspirit: I set it as the menu key
[11:17] <n3rdism> pablooooooooooooooooooo: http://www.vmware.com/support/gsx3/doc/manage_prefs_gsx.html
[11:17] <soundray> sn9: that's only relevant on release upgrades, though. It would have been my next warning. Right now, Trixsey has not even quite followed the first argument ;)
[11:17] <Vspirit> OoberMick: yeah, did the same, where do you define the key combinations?
[11:17] <n3rdism> pabloooooo: looks like you can change the key combination for keyboard release in vmware
[11:17] <swaby1> anyone help with limewire install edgy eft
[11:18] <n3rdism> pabloooooo: ctrl + F in firefox and search for release
[11:18] <swaby1> I think my repositories are screwed
[11:18] <OoberMick> Vspirit: not sure how ypu add more but the defaults are here: http://www.schwarzvogel.de/compose.shtml
[11:19] <DreamerHxC1> ops
[11:19] <DreamerHxC1> hi again
[11:19] <n3rdism> hola
[11:19] <DreamerHxC1> hola
[11:19] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: about to post it :)
[11:19] <Vspirit> OoberMick: thanks, I think I'm going for the compose key solution combined with putting stickers on the uk keyboard, where they Danish characters normally are.
[11:19] <DreamerHxC1> good!
[11:20] <DreamerHxC1> cause im going crazy

[11:40] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[11:40] <kitche> kralcymerej: you should of had a pm from ubotu about dvd
[11:42] <foxure> Hello. I have a problem with my network.. i have one 1Gbit nic in one computer and 100Mbit in the other. But the speed beetween them is only 10Mbit
[11:42] <sn9> foxure: it could be the cable
[11:43] <foxure> sn9, but the cable is a new CAT6
[11:44] <RockStar86> hi guys
[11:44] <sn9> foxure: that doesn't automatically mean the connectors are wired in a manner compatible with gigabit
[11:44] <adrenaline> Hi RockStar86
[11:44] <slavik> foxure: Cat6 is for gigabit over copper?
[11:44] <RockStar86> hi from italy
[11:44] <slavik> RockStar86: hello
[11:44] <adrenaline> Hi from WA USA
[11:44] <slavik> and from NY USA :D
[11:45] <sn9> slavik: cat5, if wired properly, can also work
[11:45] <slavik> !ru
[11:45] <ubotu>    #ubuntu-ru       /  Pozhalujsta vojdite v #ubuntu-ru dlq pomoshchi na russkom qzyke
[11:45] <slavik> sn9: I see
[11:45] <DreamerHxC1> slavik [code] chmod ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run[/code]  ==> chmod +x or what?
[11:45] <RockStar86> what time is it over there?
[11:45] <foxure> sn9, maybe.. but i don't think thats the problem.. but i don't know
[11:45] <adrenaline> It is 245PM here
[11:45] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: to make it executable (look into next step)
[11:45] <RockStar86> eheh 23.44 here!
[11:46] <sn9> DreamerHxC1: never use the ati driver installer under ubuntu unless you know exactly what it will break
[11:46] <DreamerHxC1> but if I do just chmod it doesn't work
[11:46] <foxure> sn9, But even if its a crappy cable.. then i should at least handle more than 10Mbit?
[11:46] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: that's why there is a +x
[11:46] <DreamerHxC1> im totally out of ideas sn9
[11:46] <kralcymerej> ok read the site and downloaded the recommended the library. trying to activate the DVD decryption and the terminal is giving me this "dpkg: status database area is locked by another process
[11:46] <kralcymerej> "
[11:46] <slavik> oops
[11:46] <DreamerHxC1> oh ok
[11:46] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: add +x between chmod and ati-installer
[11:46] <sn9> foxure: it depends, but don't rule out a driver issue just yet
[11:46] <tonyyarusso> kralcymerej: You can't have synaptic and apt-get run at the same time
[11:46] <bimberi> kralcymerej: close synaptic
[11:46] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: chmod +x ati-driver-installer-8.31.5-x86.x86_64.run
[11:47] <foxure> sn9,  but how could a check what the interface on the computer says?
[11:48] <sn9> foxure: i think you can install a command called mii-tool or something
[11:48] <fabio__|> which program can I install to set the general volume of audio? (i'm under xubuntu, and i don't find the program the set the volumes..
[11:48] <DreamerHxC1> yeah so I did slavik
[11:48] <DreamerHxC1>  ;)
[11:48] <tengil> i just upgraded to edgy and i can no longer the swedish special characters
[11:48] <tengil> anyoen got any ideas as to why
[11:48] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: and?
[11:48] <mydani> What's the best way to add adobe flash to firefox on efty (amd64)?
[11:48] <DreamerHxC1> good
[11:48] <DreamerHxC1> it's ok by now
[11:48] <foxure> sn9, okey.. thx
[11:48] <kitche> fabio__|: you can open up a terminal and do sudo alsamixer then do sudo alsactl store
[11:48] <slavik> mydani: I don't think there is one ... is there?
[11:48] <sn9> tengil: there was a whole thread about that in the forum, with a fix
[11:49] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: what step are you on?
[11:49] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: you will probably have to do the code in the troubleshooting step 1 ...
[11:49] <mydani> slavik, I'd hope
[11:49] <killown> how I configure my card video VIA/S3G Unichrome (PRO) ?
[11:49] <DreamerHxC1> wait
[11:49] <zack> hello
[11:50] <DreamerHxC1> when sTep 5: sudo dpkg -i *.deb
[11:50] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: that installs the packages (source code, driver, etc.)
[11:50] <DreamerHxC1> it says errors found: fglrx-control_8.31.5-1_i386.deb
[11:50] <kralcymerej> please bear in mind that I'm a complete noob, but now XINE is telling me that "The source can not be read - maybe you don't have enough rights for this or the source doesn't contain any data"
[11:50] <fabio__|> kitche: thanks! alsamixer seems to work fine"
[11:50] <delire> is there a fix for grub not seeing a USB keyboard?
[11:50] <zack> anyway to get ubuntu to recognize a Linksys wireless router?
[11:50] <alecjw> my gnome-panel crashes as soon as it starts! how can i fix this#
[11:50] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: pastebin the output after the command
[11:51] <kitche> fabio__|: remember when you exit alsamixer do sudo alsactl store and it will store yoursettigns so when you reboot they come back
[11:51] <slavik> !pastebin | DreamerHxC1
[11:51] <ubotu> DreamerHxC1: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[11:51] <zack> anyway to get ubuntu to recognize a Linksys wireless router?
[11:51] <tengil> sn9: i searched there now and found a thread that never had an answer. do you know the subject line of that thread or something?
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> yes I know but im in other computer
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> hum
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> wait
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> i did sudo dpkg -i *.deb again
[11:51] <sn9> killown: those are a major PITA, but work great once configured
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> and this time everything worked :O
[11:51] <slavik> ahh, then read it and tell me what it tells you ...
[11:51] <DreamerHxC1> no error
[11:51] <kralcymerej> help??
[11:51] <slavik> weird ...
[11:51] <alecjw> anyone?
[11:52] <slavik> are you sure it installed everything?
[11:52] <sn9> delire: it's a bios thing
[11:52] <zack> anyway to get ubuntu to recognize a Linksys wireless router?
[11:52] <killown> sn9 how I configure it?
[11:52] <sn9> zack: what do you mean?
[11:52] <killown> I not found driver for my card
[11:53] <DreamerHxC1> I think so
[11:53] <DreamerHxC1> at least it showed no error
[11:53] <zack> sn9 >> i cant install drivers for my wireless card...
[11:53] <sn9> killown: the driver is in there, but it's quite finicky -- very difficult to get working
[11:53] <killown> ahhhh
[11:53] <killown> freebsd work it
[11:53] <alecjw> please, this is really important!
[11:53] <sn9> zack: oh, a card. i thought you first said a router, which didn't make sense
[11:54] <DreamerHxC1> ok first error
[11:54] <plesnivyjano> hi there..is it possible to customize message of the day for each and every user?
[11:54] <sn9> zack: which linksys card is it? one of the GS models?
[11:54] <zack> sn9: my mistake, is there anyway to download linux drivers for my card?
[11:54] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: go on
[11:54] <DreamerHxC1> after blacklisting fglrx, when I sudo modprobe fglrx
[11:54] <slavik> is it when doing modprobe?
[11:54] <delire> sn9: the bios sees the keyboard just fine. i can't see any settings in the bios that would remove keyboard input.
[11:54] <zack> sn9: WMP54GS
[11:55] <sn9> delire: usb legacy support
[11:55] <DreamerHxC1> it says: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist line 29: ignoring bad line starting with 'ati-agp'
[11:55] <sn9> zack: is that a usb one?
[11:55] <delire> sn9: i'll have a look for this. cheers..
[11:55] <zack> sn9: no sir
[11:55] <DreamerHxC1> I think I have to remove that line...
[11:55] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: looks like
[11:55] <alecjw> zack: there were several different revisions of that card. sn9 will beed to know which you have
[11:56] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: there should be a single line in that file that doesn't start with a #, it should say DISABLED_MODULES="fglrx"
[11:56] <sn9> zack: if it's a GS model that isn't usb, you can get it to work with the bcm43xx-fwcutter -- it's a FAQ item
[11:56] <DreamerHxC1> that's in /etc/modules/linux
[11:56] <DreamerHxC1> sorry
[11:56] <maba> how can it be that Ubuntu dhcp-clien/ip-settings works in one but not in the other?
[11:56] <slavik> yea
[11:56] <DreamerHxC1> that's in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
[11:57] <slavik> yea
[11:57] <DreamerHxC1> DISABLED_MODULES="fglrx"
[11:57] <DreamerHxC1> ok
[11:57] <zack> sn9: yeah its just the WMP54GS that goes in a PCI slot
[11:57] <sn9> alecjw: with linksys, all the GS models are always broadcom
[11:57] <DreamerHxC1> modprobe fglrx show nothing
[11:57] <slavik> good
[11:57] <nub> is it feasible to use lvm in root for an edgy install?
[11:57] <DreamerHxC1> ok, I go on
[11:57] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: means it is loaded, you should see it when you do 'lsmod | grep fglrx'
[11:57] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: do 'fglrxinfo'
[11:57] <zack> sn9: thanks for the information
[11:58] <RockStar86> bye bye guys, good night
[11:58] <maba> good night
[11:58] <DreamerHxC1> slavik
[11:58] <DreamerHxC1> in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:58] <slavik> yes?
[11:58] <RockStar86> see you
[11:58] <DreamerHxC1> I have to sections with "Device"
[11:58] <slavik> go on
[11:58] <maba> dhcp/ip-setting problem!
[11:58] <DreamerHxC1> two sections
[11:58] <kralcymerej> in the goal of playing dvds on my system I loaded Xine, but it is telling me that "The source can not be read - maybe you don't have enough rights for this or the source doesn't contain any data" any ideas?
[11:58] <slavik> the one with the video card ...
[11:58] <Seveas> DreamerHxC1, do you have 2 videocards or a dual head card?
[11:58] <DreamerHxC1> no
[11:59] <slavik> one of them should have Drive "ati" (could be radeon instead
[11:59] <DreamerHxC1> ill show u
[11:59] <slavik> ore ven fglrx
[11:59] <DreamerHxC1> yeah
[11:59] <slavik> k
[11:59] <DreamerHxC1> but the other has fglrx
[11:59] <killown> driver via works to card video  VIA Technologies, Inc. UniChrome Pro IGP ?
[12:00] <sn9> killown: the driver is called "unichrome" iirc
[12:00] <nub> rather if I format my root partition with lvm will I be able to use it in my edgy install?
[12:00] <slavik> dreamer, the one with ati, does it have '#' in front of every line?
[12:00] <sn9> killown: but in some places it's called "via"
[12:00] <DreamerHxC1> no
[12:00] <delire> sn9: seems this bios has no option for toggling USB legacy support.. oh well.
[12:00] <killown> sn9, ubuntu has support to it?
[12:01] <jimmypw> Im having a problem with screen. SOmetimes when i exit an application in one of the screens the pricess becomes defunct (zombie) is there any way i can restore my access to the session or stop this from happening
[12:01] <slavik> DreamerHxC1: put a # in beginning of every line for that Section
