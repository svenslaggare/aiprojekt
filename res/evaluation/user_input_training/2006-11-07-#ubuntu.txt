[12:01] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, time for broadband ;) can your computer not handle multitasking?
[12:01] <mcphail> gpa: using 'sudo' allows you to break it on purpose ;)
[12:01] <odin> Nativow: where do you want to copy /usr/include to? the files in /usr/include probably will not work in another location
[12:01] <abo> crimsun, note: during my searching, I came across this page and tried the steps inside, didn't work obviously, but thought it's worth telling you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToConfigureSoundBlasterAudigySEinBreezy
[12:01] <gpa> say I wanted to create a folder in file system
[12:01] <crimsun> abo: amixer set 'Audigy Analog/Digital Output Jack' on
[12:01] <gpa> how would I do that, its not like windows where you can go into a folder and make new folders
[12:01] <Nativow> odin: im using cp -R /home/..../ /usr/include
[12:01] <Neo_Angelo> i use wireless and was wondering how to set it up with linux when i only have an .exe file to install it off...
[12:02] <Nativow> odin: im copying to /usr/include
[12:02] <rosabonita> crimsub>is there a driver for the quickcam pro4000?
[12:02] <mcphail> gpa: you can make "folders" in your home directory
[12:02] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, you are trying to use your wireless card?
[12:02] <tez> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30487/
[12:02] <crimsun> rosabonita: is it a usb device?
[12:02] <rosabonita> ya
[12:02] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb - Yeah i runs the disc and it says it can't be run
[12:02] <odin> Nativow: you need a wildcard....cp -R /home/Nativow/temp/* /usr/include
[12:02] <crimsun> rosabonita: pastebin the output from ``lsusb -v''
[12:02] <gpa> how
[12:02] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, what kind of card
[12:02] <Takmadeus> livingadaylight: my PC supports multitasking (AFAIK) but my internet connection does not.. it is so lame that any kind of new connection outside makes everything mess up
[12:02] <Nativow> odin, let me try
[12:03] <digilink> anyone have beryl up and running on dapper? I'm having a time :(
[12:03] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb, 802.11g wireless LAN cardbus PC card/PCI card
[12:03] <odin> Nativow: be careful or you might end up with a bunch of stuff in /usr/include
[12:03] <mcphail> gpa: just right-click and "create folder"
[12:03] <eobanb_> digilink, i have it running
[12:03] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, i see, no worries
[12:03] <abo> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30488/ the sound is mono, how can I get it in stereo
[12:03] <digilink> eobanb: can you help me?
[12:03] <gnomefreak> digilink: ask in #ubuntu-xgl please
[12:03] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: something funny happened
[12:03] <rosabonita> crimsun<can't get hub descriptor: Operation not permitted
[12:03] <rosabonita> cannot read device status, Operation not permitted (1)
[12:03] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: what?
[12:03] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, okayy...what brand? what chipset? is it a cardbus card or a PCI card?
[12:03] <gpa> wont let me
[12:03] <crimsun> rosabonita: don't paste here.
[12:04] <odin> Nativow: I would suggest testing first in a temp directory to make sure you know exactly how it will work
[12:04] <rosabonita> oh sorry
[12:04] <gpa> is file systems basically C: in windows
[12:04] <crimsun> rosabonita: those messages are harmless.
[12:04] <eobanb_> digilink, i'd be happy to help you in #ubuntu-xgl
[12:04] <mcphail> gpa: you are in your home directory?
[12:04] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: i restarted x and it worked
[12:04] <digilink> ty :)
[12:04] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: but I got this message that I needed to restart my machine
[12:04] <gpa> I am in my computer
[12:04] <Jural> anyone in here fimilar with gdesklets that can give me a hand??
[12:04] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: that happens when you have things set up right
[12:04] <rosabonita> crimsun<uh, what am i supposed to do?
[12:04] <gpa> then I click file system
[12:04] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: so I did, and now I get an error
[12:04] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb_ , its a card that goes in the PC i think its make is ADDON
[12:04] <mcphail> gpa: oh, you are wanting to write to a windows partition?
[12:04] <crimsun> rosabonita: paste _all_ the output onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:04] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: what error what was the message
[12:04] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, 'in the PC'?
[12:04] <Gothi[c] > I just updated, and direct rendering broke, the log reveals (EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable. after looking aruond on the net a bit i found a workaround by disabling the composite extension, which appearantly causes the problem, because now Direct rendering works. Is there any way i can keep Composite enabled and do a 'clean' fix on this issue without disabling features? (ATI X550 card)
[12:04] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: hold, i need to switch virtual terminals
[12:04] <gpa> no im wondering if filesystem isthe same thing as C: is in windows
[12:04] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, do you understand the difference between cardbus and PCI?
[12:05] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb_ , yes its fitted into one of the slots available at the back
[12:05] <tez> TGPO - is that right??
[12:05] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: FATAL: error running install command for nvidia
[12:05] <mcphail> gpa: there are similarities, but the overall concept is different
[12:05] <`Jessica> it's like the module isn't there!
[12:05] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, and if you open the Network manager, what interfaces show up>
[12:05] <`Jessica> what should I do?
[12:05] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: installing.... you can tell me how to use usenet :p
[12:05] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: what did you do after X started?
[12:05] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb_ , none
[12:05] <gpa> ooh, I see the home folder now
[12:05] <crimsun> abo: you're on your own for that. Adjust the 3D Control* elements using a mixer.
[12:05] <`Jessica>  gnomefreak: after X started with nvidia, I got a message saying I needed to restart my computer. so I did
[12:05] <gpa> is that where I can install things like .bin if I have to
[12:06] <Neo_Angelo> eobanb_, i need to install the drivers and whatnot to linux but i only have an .exe setup on the disc
[12:06] <abo> crimsun, ok :) thx
[12:06] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: what was the message word for word
[12:06] <rosabonita> crimsun<um, im a noob, how do i do that?
[12:06] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: what message?
[12:06] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: the error message?
[12:06] <crimsun> rosabonita: open a terminal and type the command I gave you
[12:06] <mcphail> gpa: it depends. A .bin file can be _anything_
[12:06] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, can you open a terminal and type 'ifconfig'
[12:06] <rosabonita> crim<got that
[12:06] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: the restart message. it wont ask you to restart for no reason
[12:06] <eobanb_> Neo_Angelo, and pastebin the output
[12:06] <gpa> for example
[12:06] <gpa> pychess-0.4.1.tar.gz
[12:07] <Neo_Angelo> ok i'll try, though i can't get on this chat from linux as i can't get anything without a connection
[12:07] <gpa> how would I install that
[12:07] <Nativow> odin: same thing is happening...  =/
[12:07] <Neo_Angelo> i'm a complete n00b to it ^_^
[12:07] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: it was a generic message. 'you need to restart your machine for updates to be installed. if you do not, security updates won't be effective, etc etc etc.
[12:07] <rosabonita> crim<how do i do that paste thing you wanted?
[12:07] <odin> Nativow: what is the error message?
[12:07] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you ready?
[12:07] <Neo_Angelo> i'll go try tahanks for the advice eobanb_
[12:07] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: Why not let's try uninstalling and reinstalling nvidia-glx?
[12:07] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: make sure nvidia-glx and linux-restricted-modules are installed for your running kernel
[12:08] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: are you on the generic kernel atm?
[12:08] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: yes
[12:08] <odin> Nativow: you also need to run the cp command as root.....'sudo cp .....'
[12:08] <mcphail> gpa: i'm not familiar with that package, but would suspect you could "install" it locally. You are aware that .tar.gz files are similar to .zip files on windows?
[12:08] <mabus> How do I make it so apache can read files in /var/www, but users in a group (say 'users') cannot?
[12:08] <gpa> oh ok
[12:08] <gpa> pychess-0.4.1.tar.gz is a chess game
[12:08] <mcphail> gpa: you need to extract them to access the files they contain
[12:08] <gpa> that I found online
[12:08] <gpa> where do I extract them
[12:08] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: yes, and that's odd. it looks like the restart had removed linux-restricted-modules-generic
[12:09] <Nativow> odin: there is no error when i copy. The problem is that in the properties of the files I copied its written link(with problem) in the /usr/include but not in my source directory
[12:09] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: go ahead
[12:09] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, so Evolution>Edit>preferences
[12:09] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: let me try to start x now, I will be back
[12:09] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: install it again
[12:09] <mcphail> gpa: why not create a new folder in your home directory, and drag it there
[12:09] <Nativow> odin: and because of this, i can not include these files in my programs
[12:09] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, in mail accounts click on ADD
[12:09] <gpa> should I intstall things in root or my name
[12:10] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, this starts your account setup wizard
[12:10] <odin> Nativow: sounds like the cp can't work because bad links are already there. Try deleting one of the bad links then do the copy
[12:10] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: OK
[12:10] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, carry on as if you wree setting up an account but instead of choosing pop account or whatever, notice 'usenet'
[12:10] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: done
[12:10] <mcphail> gpa: many small programs can be installed under your home directory for your own use.
[12:10] <youser> hey everyone hows it goig
[12:10] <tylerl> Hi.  I just followed all of the "howto" instructions on setting up my nVidia card + drivers.  It doesn't seem to work though.  When I type in "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" I get an error saying to make sure I properly installed my nVidia driver for the kernel..
[12:11] <gpa> ok I extracted it as Pychess in my home directory
[12:11] <gpa> how do I open it or see it on the "start menu"
[12:11] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: done
[12:11] <odin> Nativow: are you sure you don't need to cp those files to another directory? pointed to by the bad links?
[12:11] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you need to know your news address
[12:11] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: well that was a dry hole.
[12:11] <gnomefreak> tylerl: make sure you installed the linux-restricted-modules for the kernel you are using
[12:11] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, for me it is news.blueyonder.co.uk
[12:11] <BHSPitLappy> gpa, double click?
[12:11] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: what?
[12:11] <function1> if i add something to my applications menu with alacarte, where does the .desktop file go?
[12:11] <youser> i got a question on how to make a menu entry for a program
[12:11] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: near as I can tell, nvidia-glx is installed, so is l-r-m-g
[12:11] <tylerl> gnomefreak: I did.
[12:11] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: which server?
[12:11] <gpa> its just a folder
[12:12] <gpa> with a lot of different folders
[12:12] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, i don't know who you're isp is and hwat that might be, but the rest should be familiar, username etc

[12:12] <gnomefreak> tylerl: change the driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to read nvidia
[12:12] <youser> gnome?
[12:12] <youser> just regular dapper setup
[12:12] <tasos> i need to set up a rooter
[12:12] <mcphail> gpa: there may be a README file somewhere to click on to see how to run it
[12:12] <gnomefreak> cyber: dont do that
[12:12] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, yes, server
[12:12] <eobanb_> tasos, you mean a router?
[12:12] <tasos> ooppss yep
[12:12] <odin> youser: in System-Preferences there should be a menu choice called Menu Layout
[12:12] <youser> theres not
[12:13] <youser> theres menus and toolbars
[12:13] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you've already chosen usenet news from the scroll-down haven'tyou?
[12:13] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: any ideas on what I can do now?
[12:13] <gpa> k thanks, another question if you got time
[12:13] <eobanb_> tasos, is this a dedicated machine, or are you also using it as a workstation
[12:13] <function1> youser, look for alacarte menu editor in applications
[12:13] <Nativow> odin: these files are libraries that i want to be able to include in my C programs. So i need to cp them to /usr/include right?
[12:13] <youser> which i can set how my window toolbars look
[12:13] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: make sure the BusID line is right in xorg.conf and make sure its using nvidia drivers in device section
[12:13] <Yourname`> Hello. Can someone help me with this problem -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1723942#post1723942
[12:13] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: what to do for mail send
[12:13] <tasos> what step i should follow its a simple pc
[12:13] <odin> youser: There should be three items on the top left...one of them is System
[12:13] <youser> yep
[12:13] <eobanb_> tasos, is this a dedicated machine, or are you also using it as a workstation
[12:13] <tasos> but i need to connect to the router in order to connect to the net
[12:13] <youser> system on the far right
[12:14] <tasos> dedicated machine
[12:14] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: the busID is right...and so is the driver
[12:14] <odin> Nativow: maybe they already exist and are linked in /usr/include from someplace else.
[12:14] <function1> if i add something to my applications menu with alacarte, where does the .desktop file go?
[12:14] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, what did you put in the server
[12:14] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: let me get you the exact error again
[12:14] <gpa> when I use add/remove I find the Xchat IRC, but it says conflicting program and enable advanced mode to resolve
[12:14] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: something changed we need to find what changed
[12:14] <gpa> how do I get into advanced mode
[12:14] <odin> youser: right....click on System, then Preferences, then Menu Layout
[12:14] <eobanb_> tasos, let me make sure i understand this right...you want to use an ordinary PC that has two ethernet cards as a gateway to provide NAT and DHCP to other machines, yes?
[12:14] <Nativow> odin: hum.. maybe you are right.. ill check it
[12:14] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: it says "FATAL: Error running install command for nvidia
[12:15] <youser> i dont have menu layout
[12:15] <youser> just menus and toolbars
[12:15] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: this is the same error I get if I try to do 'modprobe nvidia'
[12:15] <odin> Nativow: where does one of those problem links point? Check that directory to see if the file is already there
[12:15] <odin> youser: if you click on System, do you get a drop down menu?
[12:15] <Takmadeus> what you told me
[12:15] <youser> yep

[12:17] <youser> should dapper?
[12:17] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, the same as what?
[12:17] <function1> odin: i think menu layout only comes in edgy

[12:18] <livingdaylight> !gnomefreak
[12:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gnomefreak - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[12:19] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: should I use a mail account then?
[12:19] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, do you know who your isp is?
[12:19] <youser> desktop entrys?
[12:19] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: 386 boots by default unless you choose -generic to boot
[12:19] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: yeah, telecom
[12:19] <gpa> how doyou reigster on this
[12:19] <odin> function1: now you know why I use enlightenment <smile>
[12:19] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: that must have been what the update was for.
[12:19] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: thats why i got rid of the 386 kernels
[12:19] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: can I use a normal mail account?
[12:19] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, then it might be news.telecom.whatever
[12:19] <kitche> gpa: /msg nickserv help
[12:20] <tannerld> gpa: /msg nickserv register pass
[12:20] <tannerld> gpa: I think
[12:20] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: because I'd never had to change the kernel
[12:20] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: well, they do not have a news server actually
[12:20] <Daro> !nat
[12:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nat - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:20] <abo> anyone can help me setup windows codecs?
[12:20] <eobanb_> !router
[12:20] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you'd need to know what the address is
[12:20] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about router - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:20] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: that's why I asked you for an example to try :p
[12:20] <function1> nah i like gnome

[12:20] <eobanb_> er, landexem
[12:20] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: i'm going to try to change the packages
[12:20] <youser> thanks for the help guys
[12:20] <youser> that menu editor worked
[12:21] <lullabud> speaking of X11, does anybody know how to do an Xnest session over ssh -x without enabling xdmcp?
[12:21] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: sorry to not be able to help properly :p
[12:21] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, so you just have email with telecom?
[12:21] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: you should beable to install the l-r-m package for 386 and it should work on both kernels. (note *should*)
[12:21] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: from l-r-m-g to l-r-m-386
[12:21] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: nope
[12:21] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: this account does not come with email
[12:21] <youser> *smacks own face*
[12:21] <gnomefreak> `Jessica: install 386 dont remove -g
[12:21] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, so what do you use Evolution for?
[12:21] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: yet I got a POP email somewhere
[12:21] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: Gmail account

[12:21] <gpa> how do youenable advanced mode in add/remove
[12:22] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, you retrieve your gmail using evolution and pop?
[12:22] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: indeed
[12:22] <`Jessica> gnomefreak: it works, thank you
[12:22] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, oh...i see
[12:22] <`Jessica> booting back to X
[12:22] <gnomefreak> `yw
[12:22] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: I just enabled pop access in my gmail account :p
[12:22] <aaron_> hey, anyone want to give a new ubuntu user a hand?
[12:22] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, i'll have to try that then. I just have the gmail notifier in my taskbar
[12:22] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: did some config to evolution and I am now using it ;)
[12:22] <landexem> eobanb_: That didn't work.
[12:22] <odin> aaron: just ask the question
[12:23] <eobanb_> landexem, can you describe the problem in more detail
[12:23] <Takmadeus> it is not that hard, actually there is not much problem setting it up ;9
[12:23] <aaron_> i installed ubuntu on a seperate partition of my hard drive, and want to get some of the media files i have on a different partition into ubuntu's partition
[12:23] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: but make sure that you enable pop access in your gmail account
[12:23] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, yea, i did that with thunderbird before
[12:23] <aaron_> the other partition is ntfs
[12:23] <odin> aaron_: did you install a dual boot system?
[12:23] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: same thing can be done with evolution ;)
[12:24] <aaron_> i have the grub boot loader if thats what you mean
[12:24] <landexem> I'm trying to install XGL following a guide, but it didn't work and now that I've added this script to autostart with GNOME it just crashes trying to load compiz and restarts X11.
[12:24] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, yea, i get it.. shame about the newsgroup thingy...never mind
[12:24] <livingdaylight> Takmadeus, thx for trying
[12:24] <lullabud> Does anybody know how to start an Xnested gnome-session from ssh -X without having to enable xdmcp ?
[12:24] <odin> aaron_: right...in a terminal type 'mount' and see if the other partitions are already mounted
[12:24] <landexem> eobanb_: So I want to know where the config file is located that stores applications auto-starting in GNOME so I can change it in the console
[12:24] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: i am sure someone else can help you, sorry for not being able to help :(
[12:24] <odin> aaron_: I bet they are mounted in /windows
[12:24] <aaron_> how do i get to the terminal?
[12:24] <aaron_> sorry to ask such noobish questions
[12:24] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: but do not worry, given the case that you need help and I'm around it's OK ;)
[12:25] <eobanb_> landexem, does the problem happen before you even log in, or does it happen as gnome is loading
[12:25] <odin> aaron_: are you running gnome?
[12:25] <gpa> aaron applications accesories terminal
[12:25] <lullabud> aaron_:  alt-F2  ->  gnome-terminal
[12:25] <lk11mn> hi, I hope someone can help me, i'm trying to install ubuntu, but when i get to "select a disk" it shows me the partition i want to setup on (which is in /dev/mapper) but it will only allow me to resise the disks (/dev/sda) how to i get an option for the dev/mapper paritions in this manual partition reseze section, thx for readin anyway :p
[12:25] <aaron_> i got a "run application window
[12:25] <lullabud> aaron_:  gnome-terminal
[12:25] <lullabud> aaron_:  but actually i like gpa's advice, but i'd right-click and hit "add to panel" ;-)
[12:25] <youser> i also have a tricky router problem
[12:26] <aaron_> now i type mount?
[12:26] <landexem> eobanb_: It happens as GNOME is loading
[12:26] <gpa> I went to system-prefs-keyboard shorcuts and made mine alt-1
[12:26] <landexem> I can access GDM and the terminals tty1-6 just fine
[12:26] <eobanb_> landexem, you know how to set gdm to run a gnome failsafe session instead of the default session?
[12:26] <nolimitsoya> lk11mn, /dev/mapper? are you using some sort ofencryption software?
[12:27] <aaron_> /dev/sdb7 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
[12:27] <aaron_> proc on /proc type proc (rw)
[12:27] <aaron_> sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
[12:27] <aaron_> devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
[12:27] <aaron_> tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
[12:27] <aaron_> usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
[12:27] <gpa> how do youget into advacned mode for add/remove??
[12:27] <aaron_> tmpfs on /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/volatile type tmpfs (rw,mode=0755)
[12:27] <aaron_> tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,size=10M,mode=0755)
[12:27] <aaron_> there is what i got
[12:27] <eobanb_> !paste
[12:27] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:27] <nolimitsoya> !pastebin | aaron
[12:27] <landexem> eobanb_: I just tried that, but it still executed my script and crashed X11.
[12:27] <ubotu> aaron: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[12:27] <eobanb_> what script?
[12:27] <tez> hey can someone give me a hand mounting a second hard drive?
[12:27] <aaron_> i didnt get any /win things
[12:27] <lk11mn> nolimitsoya: no, i have an existing raid array, but its working
[12:28] <gpa> can someone tell me how to get into advanced mode in add/remove so I can install Xchat irc (it has a conflicting program)
[12:28] <aaron_> what do i click to mount a hard drive?
[12:28] <nolimitsoya> gpa, use apt-get instead, or synaptic
[12:28] <compudaze> gpa, use synaptic in your admin menu
[12:29] <landexem> eobanb_: The one that is supposed to launch XGL/Compiz
[12:29] <Takmadeus> livingdaylight: anyway, see ya' Hope you can solve your problem
[12:29] <piedoggie> I'm developing Python modules on ubuntu.  ubuntu is running on Windows as a guest OS under VM Ware.  The work is split with editing on Windows and configuration management (bzr) and testing on the guest OS ubuntu.  The problem is, I can't find a shared file system method that doesn't screw me over either with ownership, permissions, or stability problems.  I've tried Samba, NFS, and VM Ware...
[12:29] <piedoggie> ...shared files.  All fail.  Are there any other options I haven't considered yet?
[12:29] <gpa> apt-get what
[12:29] <roland-erau> gpa: sudo apt-get ...
[12:29] <eobanb_> landexem, ...and that would be a question for #ubuntu-xgl
[12:30] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, type in a console sudo mount /dev/<drivedesignation> -t <filesystemtype> /<mountpath>
[12:30] <kitche> piedoggie: use vfat ont he guest OS but permissions windows don't know about anyways
[12:30] <bimberi> gpa: try Synaptic, accessible via System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
[12:30] <landexem> eobanb_: No, it's not.
[12:30] <nolimitsoya> gpa, sudo apt-get remove xchat removes xchat, sudo apt-get remove --purge xchat removes xchat and all configuration files, sudo apt-get install xchat installs xchat
[12:31] <gpa> and search using all? (theres so many words)
[12:31] <piedoggie> maybe I could use a thumb drive and try mounting that as a shared file system but that will be pretty tricky since the fat drivers don't know about sharing between two operating systems
[12:31] <nolimitsoya> gpa, 'man apt-get' in terminal gives you the manual
[12:31] <landexem> When one adds a program to System -> Preferences -> Sessions then Startup Programs -> Add, where is the configuration file that controls this list of auto-starting programs within GNOME?
[12:31] <nolimitsoya> gpa, to search using apt, type apt-cache search xchat
[12:31] <aaron_> can you please explain again how to mount a hard drive partition?
[12:31] <piedoggie> I've learned more about Windows permissions than I care to think about.  Windows maps to about a third of what UNIX can do for permissions.
[12:31] <gpa> ncie thank you
[12:32] <piedoggie> I think that's almost worse than not knowing anything.
[12:32] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, type in a console sudo mount /dev/<drivedesignation> -t <filesystemtype> /<mountpath> :)  what part do you want explained?
[12:32] <gpa> can I use apt-cache for searching anything?
[12:32] <eobanb_> landexem, sigh.  yes, it is.  all xgl-related questions should go to #ubuntu-xgl.
[12:32] <nolimitsoya> gpa, yes
[12:32] <tuskernini> sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/hard_drive_folder
[12:32] <eobanb_> landexem, i'll be happy to help you over there.
[12:32] <livingdaylight> Can someone help me with Evolution. Usenet doesn't work for me.
[12:32] <landexem> eobanb_: This isn't an XGL question because all I want is to disable a script I told to startup with GNOME.
[12:32] <Tonren> Hey guys, I upgraded to Edgy and now I can't Ctrl + C out of boot-up processes (like Configuring network interfaces...) anymore.
[12:32] <Tonren> I turned off "Quiet" but I still can't Ctrl + C out of a process.
[12:32] <livingdaylight> Does Usenet work for anybody out there using Evolution?
[12:32] <probose> well, i made some shit and now my tray icons dont appear (just the sound icon). How do i set'em up again?
[12:33] <youser> to mount a hard drive
[12:33] <youser> sudo fdisk -l
[12:33] <eobanb_> landexem, but it's the script to start Xgl, yes?
[12:33] <eobanb_> therefore it's an Xgl question
[12:33] <Ecrouch> lol, i cant get ubuntu to detect my harddrive, anyone want to help
[12:33] <youser> make sure it is already hooked up
[12:33] <plugwash> Tonren iirc edgy totally replaced the init structure
[12:33] <gg_> hi to all the person who like ubuntu
[12:33] <plugwash> Tonren so issues like this would be expected
[12:33] <landexem> The script is screwing things up, and I want it gone.  The fact that it's XGL-related shouldn't matter in this particular case because I just want to boot into GNOME without XGL for now, THEN get XGL working
[12:33] <Kuprin> Meow people. I upgraded to Edgy and VisualBoyAdvance is running incredibly slowly now. Haven't tried any other games, but the general OS is significantly slower. What's up?
[12:33] <probose> well, i made some shit and now my tray icons dont appear (just the sound icon). How do i set'em up again?
[12:33] <tez> <nolimitsoya> I just tried that and I get the error mount point /backup does not exist?
[12:33] <youser> to mount a hard drive
[12:33] <youser> sudo fdisk -l
[12:33] <Tonren> plugwash: I'm not concerned as to whether or not they're expected.  I just want a fix!
[12:33] <youser> make sure it is already hooked up
[12:33] <LjL> !language | probose, add the notification area applet (right click on the panel) to get it back, and
[12:33] <ubotu> probose, add the notification area applet (right click on the panel) to get it back, and: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[12:33] <Ecrouch> no, i mean for installing ubuntu
[12:33] <landexem> eobanb_: But thanks for the offer on helping out with XGL after I disable this script
[12:34] <Tonren> plugwash: Either there should be a way to specify to /etc/network/interfaces, "Don't bother connecting if there's nothing plugged into the ethernet port," which would be ideal, or there should be a way to Ctrl + C out of boot processes.
[12:34] <aaron_> it replied mount: only root can do that
[12:34] <nolimitsoya> tez, have you created that folder? if its in your home, or in the path you are currently browsing, there should be no leading /
[12:34] <bettyboop1975> ce sarebbe asp
[12:34] <bimberi> probose: add the Notification Area applet to your panel.  Language unneccessary thankyou
[12:34] <tuskernini> aaron, use sudo
[12:34] <gpa> thanks all
[12:34] <aaron_> oh okay
[12:34] <tuskernini> aaron_: use sudo
[12:34] <lk11mn> help plz, im manually resizing partitions for ubuntu, but the partition i want which is in /dev/mapper/ doesnt show up in the "select a disk" part of the install? i can only see the /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc, thx
[12:34] <Ecrouch> when i go to install ubuntu, it doesnt detect the harddrive
[12:34] <nolimitsoya> tez, if its in you home th full path would be /home/<username>/<folder>
[12:34] <probose> bimberi: add the Notification? what is it?
[12:35] <LjL> probose, right click on the panel, choose "Add applet", and choose "Notification area"
[12:35] <E_Presly> edgy - initramfs - error at boot, cant mount root... anyone can help?
[12:35] <bimberi> probose: right-click on the panel, Add to Panel ..., Utilities Section, Notification Area
[12:35] <compudaze> anyone compile cedega cvs on edgy?
[12:35] <LjL> probose: the notification area is the system tray.
[12:35] <kitche> Tonren: there's a way just don't have dhcpcd run at boot
[12:35] <aaron_> what mountpath should i use? bin?
[12:35] <probose> bimberi: there is no "add applet option =/"
[12:35] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, you can use any folder you want, as long as its empty
[12:35] <tez> <nolimitsoya> there is now a backup directory in my home folder but nothing in it??
[12:35] <Tonren> kitche: Yeah, but then when I'm wired, I have to wait for it to run once I log in.
[12:35] <aaron_> ok, thank you very much
[12:36] <Kuprin> So does anyone know why Edgy has caused games to slow down so much?
[12:36] <Tonren> It's totally stupid that Ubuntu still can't intelligently configure network interfaces.
[12:36] <bimberi> probose: you need to right-click on an empty area of the panel
[12:36] <nolimitsoya> tez, have you mounted a drive in that folder? in that case, has the free space changed for that folder, and was the drive empty?
[12:36] <probose> bimberi im doeing so
[12:36] <tez> no the drive has a lot of data on it
[12:36] <bimberi> probose: and it's "Add to Panel..."
[12:36] <landexem> How do I disable things I told to autostart with GNOME by going to System -> Preferences -> Sessions, then Startup Programs -> Add
[12:36] <tez> i thought I just did
[12:36] <Neil3> hey folks anyone else having issues installing the nvidia driver, specifically running the script after install to configure xorg.conf? seems to not want to do anything.
[12:36] <kitche> Tonren: oh it's intelligently any distro that you have dhcpcd on during boot will tkae a while to scan for a dhcpcd if once isn't there
[12:36] <nolimitsoya> tez, then try again :)
[12:36] <probose> LjL, what is happening, for example, when i open amarok, i cant see its icon in the tray
[12:37] <bimberi> probose: you're using Gnome right?
[12:37] <Tonren> kitche: There's no way to check and see if there's a cable plugged into the ethernet port?  You've gotta be kidding me.
[12:37] <nolimitsoya> tez, whats the name of your drive, its filesystem and your user?
[12:37] <probose> bimberi yes... theres the option "add to panel"
[12:37] <aaron_> what would the filepath to the desktop be?
[12:37] <probose> but theres nothing inside that option that can fix my problem
[12:37] <aaron_> i made a folder on the desktop
[12:37] <tez> <nolimitsoya> now getting the error - /dev/hda5 already mounted or /home/tez/backup busy
[12:37] <nolimitsoya> aaron /home/<username>/Desktop
[12:38] <aaron_> thanks:)
[12:38] <nolimitsoya> tez, sudo umount /dev/hda5
[12:38] <Eric44> Has anyone else had problems with their machine slowing down considerably when the Internet goes down/gets disconnected?
[12:38] <kitche> Tonren: dhcpcd is checking if a cable is plugged into the ethernet port, but then again I run a static ip on my computer so I don't have to deal with things like that
[12:38] <LjL> probose, there should be a "notification area" applet in there.
[12:38] <bimberi> probose: what do you mean?  Have you added a Notification Area applet?
[12:38] <aaron_> special device /dev/E: does not exist
[12:38] <Tonren> kitche: If it was checking, then it wouldn't hang when nothing's plugged in.
[12:38] <aaron_> E: is the designation of the hard drive
[12:38] <Kraig> hi, i'm getting "Could not launch menu item. Details: Failed to fork (cannot allocate memory)", never saw this before, any ideas?
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, linux doesnt use letters for drive designation
[12:39] <LjL> Kraig: wow. do you have a swap partition?
[12:39] <tez> <nolimitsoya> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30489/ - might be more useful to you
[12:39] <aaron_> what does it use?
[12:39] <eobanb_> rofl, /dev/E:
[12:39] <eobanb_> bahahaha
[12:39] <eobanb_> that's great.
[12:39] <Eric44> Heh.
[12:39] <kitche> Tonren: it doesn't hang but maybe dhclient will be faster for you
[12:39] <tez> <nolimitsoya> got the error /dev/hda5: not mounted
[12:39] <gg_> bye bye
[12:39] <Kraig> LjL: Swap:       489972     356876     133096 (that's what free returns, last value is free)
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, you drive will be /dev/hda1 for primary pata master partition1, /dev/hdb1 for secondary master partition1, and so on
[12:40] <filque> hi
[12:40] <Eric44> Hi, filque.
[12:40] <E_Presly> My ubuntu (edgy) stops during boot. It say it cant mount root and then say something about initramfs? Can someone point me in some direction?
[12:40] <Harksaw> did upgrading to edgy break folding@home for anyone else?
[12:40] <nolimitsoya> eobanb_, please be nice :)
[12:40] <aaron_> what about sdb?
[12:40] <eobanb_> nolimitsoya, i know, i know, i usually am, but that was too funny.
[12:40] <youser> thats why i dnt upgrade to dgy
[12:40] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, sdb would be secondary scsi/sata drive :)
[12:40] <alex__> Hello.
[12:40] <E_Presly> I should add that it was almost a fresh install and I am running dualboot with XP
[12:40] <aaron_> ok
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> tez, you fstab should only be touched if you want a permanent mount
[12:41] <youser> i got a weird question about my router
[12:41] <LjL> Kraig, so some of it is free, but still it's quite taken up... i'd reboot honestly (or hunt for some process that's gone mad)
[12:41] <youser> if anyone has a chance
[12:41] <LjL> !ask
[12:41] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:41] <Eric44> Anyone having problems with a system slowdown when the Internet is not available?
[12:41] <youser> once my internet is running i can hook up the router and it works to my comp
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> tez, again, whats you drive designation, partition number, file system and user name? ill give you a complete cut'n'paste cvommand :)
[12:42] <Kraig> LjL: this is confusing, i never had to reboot for any reason... (least on debian :S)
[12:42] <landexem> How do I disable things I told to autostart with GNOME by going to System -> Preferences -> Sessions, then Startup Programs -> Add
[12:42] <youser> but when i shut down my comp and restart it it cant find my network card
[12:42] <Kraig> (unless we involve kernel upgrade)
[12:42] <youser> until i unhook my  router and hook direct back the modem
[12:42] <LjL> Kraig, you could just find the offending process (if any) and kill it.
[12:42] <nanotube_> hello, where is a information about my icons in my panel stored. suppose that I would like to copy it and create exactly the same shortcut in other profile without copy whole profile? thanks
[12:42] <sqworm> is there a way to list hard drives that are plugged in kinda like lspci?
[12:42] <LjL> Kraig, i'd reboot because i wouldn't bother doing that, that's all
[12:42] <tez> <nolimitsoya> I'm a newb to ubuntu as of about an hour ago - where do I find all that info?
[12:42] <Tonren> kitche: I think I'm just gonna shut it off on boot.
[12:42] <mlehrer_work> sqworm: cat /proc/partitions
[12:43] <eobanb_> landexem, the gnome failsafe session.  i know you're still talking about xgl and compiz, so please ask in #ubuntu-xgl about it
[12:43] <sqworm> mlehrer_work: will that only show mounted partitions or all?
[12:43] <aaron_> ok, i got it mounted, then i tried to open the folder and it said i didnt have necessary permission
[12:43] <nolimitsoya> tez, where is your harddrive plugged in? what partition do you want access to, and how did you format that partition?
[12:43] <Kraig> LjL: i'll kill the processes that use the most cpu, like opera...
[12:43] <eobanb_> what just happened?
[12:43] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, do you own the mount folder?
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> tez, hows it going?
[12:45] <youser> also i dnt know the model of my router
[12:45] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, to make yourself the owner of a directory or file, type sudo chown <username>:<username> /<path>
[12:46] <nolimitsoya> aaron_, to make that user the owner of all files and folders under that path, use -R
[12:51] <RegalEagle> jesus christ

[12:53] <Legendre> hey folks, there is a big problem with pdf/ps printing for older HP printers, in 6.10
[12:53] <Comrade_S> lol
[12:53] <pppoe_dude> whee
[12:53] <Comrade_S> another batch
[12:54] <Comrade_S> sup linuxmigration
[12:54] <|thunder> mine said 160 users in #ubuntu
[12:55] <youser> hey is it done resetting?
[12:55] <ibob63> think so.
[12:55] <youser> cuz i need some help
[12:56] <snerge> When I start winecfg for the first time (in a fresh kde session) I can configure it, then I close it and when I try to run it again I get this error : http://pastebin.com/818735 (Kubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10, Nvidia 8776 ) Anyone have an idea ?
[12:56] <youser> my router blocks my network card when i restart my comp
[12:57] <meherenOS-X> i can't boot the live cd it gives an error" fixed optical drive not found any ideas?
[12:57] <meherenOS-X> *found" any...
[12:57] <ibob63> does anyone know a good alternative to Ekiga? It can't seem to see my creative webcam.
[12:57] <compudaze> tell it where your fixed optical drive is
[12:57] <Comrade_S> snerge: I know nexr to nothing about wine but I think the problem is with your graphic card, xgl is preventing a iwndwo form opeining or interfering with it
[12:57] <Legendre> I see one or two unanswered requests on the ubuntu forum..
[12:57] <Legendre> anyway, I need a fix in the worst way for this.. what's the best route to take?
[12:57] <Legendre> I can't even tell if CUPS is busted in and of itself, or if the ubuntu magic broke it.
[12:57] <youser> skype?
[12:58] <RegalEagle> >_>
[12:58] <RegalEagle> What's the chat channel again?
[12:58] <meherenOS-X> compudaze, no, the computer gives that error before it even loads the cd
[12:58] <nolimitsoya> RegalEagle, #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:58] <RegalEagle> thanks
[12:58] <snerge> Comrade_S: So I shall wait for next nvidia driver releas I guess ?
[12:58] <numist> woo
[12:59] <Legendre> hm, are the lamers pounding freenode?
[12:59] <compudaze> snerge, which version of wine? no problems here
[12:59] <ibob63> is there a way to turning off all the entered and left messages?
[12:59] <snerge> compudaze: 0.9.24
[12:59] <compudaze> same here
[12:59] <aaron__> i got access to the files now, the players say i need decoders, how do i go about that?
[12:59] <youser> can i configure ubuntu to read y network card through my router?
[12:59] <dacableguy> lamers?
[12:59] <Comrade_S> snerge:  sorry I am not in the postion to help you cos I dont even use wine
[01:00] <snerge> Comrade_S: no problem, thanks :P
[01:00] <Comrade_S> kk
[01:00] <compudaze> same driver version as well
[01:00] <dacableguy> does anyone here use msstyle themes with wine?
[01:00] <Legendre> dacableguy - yeah, lamers.. kiddies, crackers, asshats etc
[01:00] <meherenOS-X> is it possible to boot off of a different computer (they both have the same arch)
[01:00] <snerge> the funny thing is that it does start the first time after a fresh session start
[01:00] <dacableguy> Legendre - gotcha :-P
=== lancetw_ is now known as lancetw
[01:01] <mwe> snerge: does it still happen if you log out of X and back in?
[01:01] <dacableguy> asshats is such a great word
[01:02] <youser> my router is an asshat
[01:02] <snerge> mwe, the first time I start winecfg or any other app it works but it does not after that, not until I exit X and log back in
[01:02] <youser> haha yep thats great
[01:02] <dredhammer> has anyone gotten wireless to work on an Acer Aspire 3000?
[01:02] <dacableguy> anyway....whenever i try using an msstyle theme with wine, its makes cpu usage shoot to 100%.....anyone else have this problem?
[01:02] <mwe> hmm
[01:02] <youser> anyone here run a router?
[01:03] <compudaze> i am a router
[01:03] <youser> one thatu dont have to unhook and hook back up everytime u restart
[01:03] <mammoth220282> can anyone halp me why i can'd connect ?
[01:03] <eobanb_> i run a router with m0n0wall.
[01:03] <compudaze> youser, why do you ask?
[01:03] <youser> will that help?
[01:03] <compudaze> i use shorewall
[01:04] <james296> what would be a great program for Ubuntu that represents FLStudio for Windows?
[01:04] <youser> well my router works after my internet is running like say right now i unhooked my ethernet and went through my modem
[01:04] <eobanb_> i think using ubuntu as a dedicated router is somewhat silly.
[01:04] <compudaze> eobanb, why
[01:04] <youser> theni could beonhere and play xbox live at the same time
[01:04] <gpa> sup
[01:04] <eobanb_> because there are plenty of much more lightweight ways to do it
[01:04] <eobanb_> i mean i can have m0n0wall on a CF card
[01:04] <youser> but after i restart it cant find my network
[01:04] <eobanb_> or use floppyfw from a floppy disk
[01:04] <dredhammer> has anyone gotten wireless to work on an Acer Aspire 3000?
[01:05] <eobanb_> m0n0wall has a nice web interface and boots in seconds
[01:05] <james296> can someone answer me plz?
[01:05] <compudaze> eobanb, my router also serves as my file server (samba), torrent downloader (torrentflux), vmware server and much much more
[01:05] <tag> the new evo seems buggy
[01:05] <gpa> anyone here watch purepwnage
[01:05] <charle97> james296, what is FLStudio?
[01:05] <compudaze> i have a netgear router i've never used, features can't even compare
[01:05] <youser> i just dont get it how i can hook it up after internet is up and it works
[01:05] <compudaze> not even the wireless access point part of it
[01:05] <eobanb_> i think we're getting a little off topic here, anyway.
[01:05] <youser> but after restart it cnt detect mt network interface
[01:06] <gpa> sry
[01:06] <james296> Fruity Loops Studio, its a music thing that lets you create ur own music
[01:06] <james296> but not just for drums like in Hydrogen for Ubuntu...
[01:06] <youser> anyone know what i can do about my router?
[01:06] <compudaze> james296, u can try to use wine to run the windows program under linux
[01:06] <james296> true...
[01:07] <charle97> james296, http://createdigitalmusic.com/2005/11/28/linux-music-lmms-linuxs-own-fruity-loops/
[01:07] <youser> or u can get used to lmms and forget about vstis
[01:07] <dredhammer> has anyone gotten wireless to work on an Acer Aspire 3000?
[01:07] <dredhammer> i followed the ubuntu guides and nada
[01:07] <snerge> mwe: it is probably something with my nvidia drivers, I am using dual lcd with xinerama ... maybe I should try with only one monitor
[01:07] <mrstatters> propellerheads software is excellent for studio emulates many thousands of pounds hardware
[01:07] <djmccormick_> why isn't bittorrent-curses included in the bittorrent package available through apt-get
[01:07] <sharperguy> whats the permission number for read
[01:07] <sharperguy> ?
[01:07] <youser> i used to use reason 3.0
[01:08] <compudaze> readonly?
[01:08] <youser> in my windows days
[01:08] <compudaze> for everyone?
[01:08] <compudaze> 444
[01:08] <nanotube> hello how can I add icon/shortcut onto my panel using shell?
[01:08] <sharperguy> i mean the number (execute us 1)
[01:08] <sharperguy> read: 4 write:2 execute: 1? yea
[01:08] <compudaze> not sure what u mean
[01:08] <youser> is there a program that can detect my network interface through a router?
[01:08] <compudaze> yeah
[01:09] <sharperguy> kool
[01:09] <mrstatters> yah reason v cool also ,no idea if it runs on linux though I use it on a windows box
[01:09] <gpa> how do you install .gz or tgz
[01:09] <youser> reason is not available for linux
[01:09] <dacableguy> whenever i try using an msstyle theme with wine, its makes cpu usage shoot to 100%.....anyone else have this problem?
[01:09] <nanotube> hello how can I add icon/shortcut onto my panel using shell?
[01:09] <compudaze> gpa kinda vague
[01:09] <youser> wine is garbage
[01:10] <dacableguy> a .gz or .tgz is just an archive...like .zip or .rar
[01:10] <compudaze> gpa, you'll most likey have to extract it, compile it, then install it, usually there's a README or INSTALL file that gives you direction
[01:10] <gpa> k thanks
[01:10] <andresmujica> 4
[01:10] <dacableguy> youser - maybe, but that doesnt help me at all...i need to use it
[01:10] <youser> lol sorry man
[01:10] <youser> good luck
[01:10] <youser> i once used wine to run winamp
[01:10] <youser> , it took a shit
[01:11] <compudaze> why do you need the themes?
[01:11] <youser> winamp looked like a black box with no buttons
[01:11] <dacableguy> i just need it for EAC
[01:11] <pssmislata> hola
[01:11] <sharperguy> umm
[01:11] <compudaze> eac?
[01:11] <docuk2> how do i change the 'resolution' of the ctrl-alt-f# consoles?
[01:11] <dacableguy> compudaze - just to make windows apps look more ubuntu'ish
[01:11] <humbraro> youser: try installing wordperfect with it - driving me nuts for the last 3 days
[01:11] <pssmislata> spanis?????
[01:11] <sharperguy> how do i fix this errpr? "sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0444, should be 0440
[01:11] <dacableguy> EAC = Exact Audio Copy
[01:11] <youser> lol no way
[01:11] <youser> im never using wine again
[01:11] <compudaze> dacableguy, beyond the titlebar?
[01:11] <markyg> hey
[01:11] <mrstatters> Does anyone use gaim or xchat with stunnel?
[01:12] <dacableguy> http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/
[01:12] <snerge> nanotube : have a look in your home, (using kubuntu) I found the file ~/.kde/share/config/kickerrc
[01:12] <compudaze> sharperguy, sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
[01:12] <mwe> docuk2: vga=??? on the kernel boot line. it might interfere with the boot splash though
[01:12] <dacableguy> yes...windows are a dark grey color, it doesnt go with ubuntu's looks in the least
[01:12] <docuk2> hrmm
[01:13] <youser> argghhj router
[01:13] <lk11mn> does anyone know how to invert/rotate the display/desktop 180degrees?
[01:13] <nanotube> snerge:  I'm using ubuntu... but I have find something in ~/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers maybe that is what I'm looking for:-)
[01:13] <medic30420> lk11mn, how heavy is the monitor
[01:13] <mrstatters> Flip monitor upside down?
[01:13] <snerge> nanotube: try with a find on an already existing shortcut like :  . -type f -exec grep "firefox" /dev/null {} \;
[01:14] <snerge> hum
[01:14] <nanotube> snerge: thanks dude..
[01:14] <lk11mn> lol guys, that's what the problem is... the monitor is already upside down... i need to flip the os
[01:14] <snerge> missing the find
[01:14] <snerge> haha
[01:14] <mrstatters> Stand on head?
[01:14] <snerge> nanotube: better :  find . -type f -exec grep "firefox" /dev/null {} \;
[01:14] <youser> lmao why is your onitor upside down
[01:15] <youser> locallamen
[01:15] <snerge> nanotube: keep that find command in note somewhere, this is extremely usefull :P
[01:15] <medic30420> lk11mn, some monitors have built in features to do this, otherwise i would imagine it is a video driver task
[01:15] <lk11mn> youser coz its how it attatches to the wall (and saves a helluva lot of room on my desktop)
[01:15] <nanotube> snerge:  why not use grep -r firefox?
[01:15] <nanotube> snerge: I will...
[01:15] <youser> it hang upside down??
[01:15] <youser> u cant reverse the hanger?
[01:16] <youser> or is there no picture flip in your monitors menu?
[01:16] <lk11mn> well the hanger is the base, and the monitor will only lie back (not forward)
[01:16] <nanotube> snerge:  so just that you know as well.. all launchers are stored in ~/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers
[01:16] <lk11mn> no, there's nothing nice like a picture flip
[01:16] <youser> that is fking ridiculous
[01:16] <mrstatters> You can get special glasses which make everything appear upside down on e-bay :P
[01:16] <lk11mn> mrstatters lol you can???
[01:16] <docuk2> mwe, if i add the vga= parameter to my menu.lst file, will update-grub revert this edit?
[01:16] <youser> niger rig your monitor to hang right side up
[01:17] <youser> use string, duct tape etc.
[01:17] <snerge> nanotube: I don't think grep -r is working on hp-ux, that's why I'm used to do it with find :P thanks for the hint
[01:17] <mwe> docuk2: not if you put it the right place
[01:17] <docuk2> mwe, ok great
[01:17] <dacableguy> well at least youser can spell racial slurs </sarcasm>
[01:17] <youser> lol i dont thinkn ur alowed to swear in here
[01:17] <youser> i dont wanna get booted
[01:17] <mwe> docuk2: that is not on the actual kernel boot line
[01:17] <lk11mn> ehmm, like i said youser it already is upsidedown
[01:17] <dacableguy> hmmm...perhaps
[01:17] <nanotube> snerge: you are welcome.. thanks for help
[01:17] <youser> hang it right side up
[01:17] <mrstatters> sure only problem is if you wear them long enough when you take them off every thing again appears upside down
[01:17] <docuk2> docuk2, oh errr then where?
[01:17] <docuk2> erm
[01:17] <docuk2> mwe, oh errr then where?
[01:17] <snerge> nanotube: always a pleasure
[01:18] <hocmin> Is there a guide to install nvidia drivers with ubuntu 6.10?
[01:18] <youser> take your eyes out and turn them upside down
[01:18] <medic30420> lk11mn, i know nvidia's driver support flipping image, i imagine that you are going to have to recompile a driver to do this
[01:18] <lk11mn> well youser it wouldnt be hanging if it wasnt upside down, it would be floating
[01:18] <youser> im sure eyeballs work like that
[01:18] <youser> well float it right side up
[01:18] <mwe> docuk2: in the comments somewhere. kopt= or something. update-grub parses the comments there
[01:18] <docuk2> mwe, ohhhh right ok i know what you mean!
[01:18] <docuk2> mwe, thanks!
[01:18] <youser> what kind of retards make a monitor that is upside down
[01:18] <lk11mn> medic30420 recompile a driver, what does that mean?
[01:19] <mwe> docuk2: yw
[01:19] <blahh> Hi! i am making a fresh installation of edgy elf on my amd64.. i succesfully created my raid0 partition.. and made a /boot B ext3 in sda(sda1), so everything went well and installation continued, until setup had to install the bootloader, then i specify grub to be install there ( /dev/sda )... error msg received: excecuting grub install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error... any 1 can help me there
[01:19] <mrstatters> australin monitor ? (uk joke)
[01:19] <medic30420> lk11mn, what graphics card do you have
[01:19] <r0bby> http://bash.org/?51403 cute lol
[01:19] <r0bby> linux pride parade
[01:19] <docuk2> am i right in understanding that ubuntu doesnt use bootsplash, it uses usplash?
[01:19] <r0bby> back in the day when we couldn't use linux openly
[01:19] <dacableguy> edgy elf....*shakes head*
[01:19] <r0bby> ...bad day
[01:19] <r0bby> s/day/joke/
[01:20] <lk11mn> medic30420 its an nvidia.... geforce 6200
[01:20] <pppoe_dude> lk11mn, did you try screen resolution settings?
[01:20] <lk11mn> yeh, i was in there, but nothing
[01:20] <youser> lokal lamen did u try putting a small shelf on your wall and mounting it right side up
[01:21] <mrstatters> does anyone use ssl to connect to irc (stunnel)?
[01:21] <youser> it would save on desk space
[01:21] <lostinc> I have recorded my CD collection to OGG. Is there a way to convert to MP3 for my ipod?
[01:21] <Zer0Her0> someone linked me to a how to kernel dev, i've sadly lost the link anyone know what i'm talking bout
[01:21] <youser> lol
=== asdf_ is now known as asdfa
[01:21] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, install nvidia-settings, there should be an option in there somewhere (Applications > System Tools > NVIDIA if you're using Gnome)
[01:21] <lk11mn> lol see youser the problem isnt the monitor being upside down... see im on windows right now and i just have nvrotate working, its im happy, sure the post is upside down, but i can see if there's a problem
[01:21] <asdfa> can someone tell me the command to batch resize images in a terminal...i'm forgetting
=== Cre[a] tiveEmb[a]  is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[01:22] <dacableguy> listinc - i wouldnt convert ogg to mp3...converting from one lossy format to another is bad practice
[01:22] <lk11mn> funkyHat, nvidia settings is like a package i can download with sinaptec?
[01:22] <dacableguy> listinc - major quality loss results
[01:22] <jtf0518> lk11mn, I have a Nvidia GeForce 6200 LE also. What kind of problem are you having?
[01:22] <humbraro> asdfa: check out exiftran or exiftools
[01:22] <ConsoleGuy> hi all, linux n00b in the house
[01:22] <lostinc> But its short term and how much loss are we talking i convert them so that I can go jogging
[01:22] <dacableguy> lostinc sorry
[01:23] <lk11mn> jtf0518 not really a problem, more an issue, i want to invert the display, like nvrotate in windows
[01:23] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, I believe it's in synaptic yep
[01:23] <DanSchnell> why when i type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart its says "Starting GNOME Display Manager...[FAIL] " ?
[01:23] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, just do a search for nvidia and see what comes up
[01:23] <lk11mn> great funkyHat i'll write it down, thx
[01:23] <jtf0518> you mean a complete 180 or just a 90 degree flip?
[01:23] <asdfa> humbraro: there's something native to the terminal (don't have to install a package) i just can't remember...
[01:23] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, one thing, you might also need to install the nvidia graphics drivers, unless you've already done that
[01:23] <dacableguy> lostinc - try installing the package "soundconverter" via synaptic...see how that works for you
[01:24] <medic30420> lk11mn, http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_readme_install.html
[01:24] <lk11mn> jtf0518 180
[01:24] <gpa> can you play 3d games such as bf2 in linux
[01:24] <mrstatters> iant that called portrait mode and landscape mode
[01:24] <humbraro> asdfa: those are terminal commands - don't know what you mean otherwise
[01:24] <ConsoleGuy> am wanting to know how to change XMMS so its larger, like WinAmp or WMP, any help?
[01:24] <lostinc> Okay thanks dacableguy
[01:24] <mwe> asdfa: mogrify from the imagemagick package will resize images I think
[01:24] <meheren> what is the command to list all known info about the box?
[01:24] <humbraro> asdfa: image rotation is not a feature of bash
[01:24] <medic30420> lk11mn, there is a option (CCW) that you can specify when loading module that will rotate the display
[01:24] <asdfa> humbraro: mogrify!
[01:24] <asdfa> mwe: thank you
[01:24] <asdfa> mwe: I couldn't remember
[01:24] <mwe> meheren: all known info?
[01:25] <meheren> mwe, ok most...
[01:25] <mwe> meheren: there is no such command
[01:25] <mwe> meheren: what dou need?
[01:25] <mrstatters> sysinfi if it were windwos :)
[01:25] <meheren> mwe, oh hehe :p
[01:25] <mrstatters> sysinfo ^
[01:25] <humbraro> ConsoleGuy: xmms should have a "doublesize" option  but its been awhile since i've used it
[01:25] <asdfa> mwe, humbraro: I forgot that was a part of imagemagick thank you
[01:25] <mwe> sysinfo?
[01:25] <lk11mn> medic30420, sry what's a ccw?
[01:26] <mwe> I don't have that
[01:26] <meheren> mwe, some of my system is dead... (lightning storm no surge protector i think...) i want to see what is working and what is not
[01:26] <humbraro> asdfa: no prob
[01:26] <mrstatters> yah but only on windows :(<---linux newb
[01:26] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, right, what you need to do is first install nvidia-glx if you haven't done so before, and install nvidia-xconfig (sorry I don't think it's nvidia-settings, although try that if nvidia-xconfig doesn't solve it)
[01:26] <meheren> is there some website that could tell me all the system profile commands?
[01:26] <charle97> meheren, top
[01:26] <tag> and the new evolution is forcibly wider than the 800 pixels I want it to live in
[01:26] <mwe> meheren: hmm
[01:26] <tag> goddamnit
[01:26] <meheren> charle97, ... the wiki?
[01:26] <charle97> meheren, no the command "top"
[01:27] <meheren> charle97, oh! ok thx :)
[01:27] <medic30420> it is (counter clock wise) a term in that readme that you can search for, you are going to have to get into some of nvidia's documentation to figure out how to do it, but apparently it can be done
[01:27] <funkyHat_> lk11mn, those are all in synaptic, although you might have to enable the universe repository to get nvidia-xconfig
[01:27] <mwe> meheren: well I'd check the disks to begin with. mount will show if stuff is even mounted correctly
[01:28] <charle97> meheren, there's also a system monitor in pnome

[01:28] <E_Presly> I have dualboot, XP and Edgy. I installed Edgy today and it worked great until I rebboted into windows and then back to edgy. I get "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off". Does windows alter my boot partition?
[01:28] <mwe> meheren: what charle97 says. if you can get into a window manager there are some gui programs
[01:28] <mrstatters> what linux equivelent of a netstat -a?
[01:29] <mzli> <E_Presly>it should not.
[01:29] <lk11mn> great, thx funkyHat_ i'll try nvidia xconfig, and i'll bookmark that link medic30420 in case that doesnt sort it, thx guys
[01:29] <rag> E_Presly: maybe..
[01:29] <charle97> mrstatters, netstat
[01:29] <visik7> mrstatters: netstat -a ?
[01:29] <snerge> mrstatters, what info are you looking for ?
[01:29] <mrstatters> all open ports
[01:29] <regeya> -a : show the state of all sockets?

[01:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about atu - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:30] <Andypat10> !ati
[01:30] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:30] <regeya> btw, rtm man netstat
[01:30] <mrstatters> didnt realise linux used windows commands
[01:30] <E_Presly> mzli, rag: I rebooted Edgy several times and it worked without problems. Then after using XP I cannot use ubuntu anymore. :(.
[01:30] <snerge> mrstatters, this is what netstat-a does on linux too, it just put the service name instead of the port (if know) try with netstat -an if this is the result you want
[01:30] <charle97> mrstatters, unix commands
[01:30] <sethk> E_Presly, installing xp, or just booting it?
[01:30] <snerge> mrstatters, it is the other way around, netstat is unix command
[01:30] <mwe> mrstatters: sudo netstat -ntulp will show listening tcp ports
[01:31] <mzli> <ubotu>  install easyubuntu, a intergrated tools include ati driver.
[01:31] <rag> E_Presly: look for grub reinstall
[01:31] <apokryphos> !easyubuntu
[01:31] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[01:31] <mzli> <E_Presly> It's some strange.
[01:31] <E_Presly> sethk: just booting it.
[01:31] <regeya> mrstatters, if it's a unix command on a windows machine, unless you installed it, it's probably bsd
[01:31] <sethk> mrstatters, snerge is correct.  netstat existed in unix long before dos existed, let alone windows
[01:31] <regeya> os x uses bsd netstat
[01:31] <sethk> E_Presly, that's quite odd.
[01:32] <kitche> regeya: that's because mac os x is bsd
[01:32] <E_Presly> rag: Yeah I saw a possible solution to this in the forums, about the grub list.
[01:32] <Sethwm2> http://ubuntu.ytmnd.com/
[01:32] <rag> E_Presly, my recommendation , re-generate grub
[01:32] <sethk> regeya, that's correct, yes, freebsd netstat which was originally bsd netstat with a slight bit of added stuff, I think
[01:32] <medic30420> lk11mn, you can set those options in your x11 config file under <nvidia>
[01:32] <regeya> kitche: fairly incorrect, but I'll let it drop
[01:32] <sethk> E_Presly, no, I doubt that's at all relevant
[01:32] <drarem> how do you concatenate paths, like:  path=$HOME:/..
[01:32] <sethk> E_Presly, what happens when you boot?  do you get the grub menu?
[01:32] <drarem> with a semicolon?
[01:32] <mwe> what the heck is this. I try to run sysinfo and it says "*** stack smashing detected ***:" and terminates.
[01:32] <snerge> drarem, yup
[01:32] <sethk> drarem, no, colon
[01:33] <snerge> err yeah, :
[01:33] <regeya> kitche: nevermind...duh...you're right...userland has a lot of bsd
[01:33] <E_Presly> sethk: Yes I get the Grub and I can select ubuntu or win
[01:33] <drarem> and like this:  =$HOME:/folder1; $HOME:/folder2
[01:33] <medic30420> http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HOWTO+NVidia
[01:33] <kitche> regeya: Darwin is Mac OS x kernel which is BSD
[01:33] <mrstatters> sysinfo is a winxp pro command
[01:33] <khirr> how can i change my resolution?????
[01:33] <regeya> kitche: my 'os x is not freebsd' reflex kicked in for a bit, sorry
[01:33] <aaron_> can i log in as root from the GUI?
[01:33] <sethk> E_Presly, ok, and what happens when you select linux?
[01:33] <mrstatters> like netstat
[01:33] <mrstatters> lol
[01:33] <mzli> <E_Presly>what's the err msg when you start edgy?
[01:33] <sethk> regeya, well, that's true, it isn't, even though it borrows quite a bit from it.
[01:33] <mrstatters>  sry couldnt resist
[01:33] <aaron_> anyone?
[01:34] <morphish> regeya: http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/netstat.8.html
[01:34] <sethk> aaron_, sure, if you've set the root password.  but you probably shouldn't
[01:34] <aaron_> i have, can i do it from the terminal?
[01:34] <sethk> aaron_, why not just start whatever program you think you need to run as root, as root, instead of the entire gui?
[01:34] <drarem> separate with a space?
[01:34] <snerge> drarem oh, just put PATH=$HOME/folder1:$HOME/folder2
[01:34] <E_Presly> sethk, mzli: right after ubuntu splash: "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"
[01:34] <sethk> aaron_, do what?  you can su
[01:34] <drarem> thanks
[01:35] <aaron_> i need to set permissions for a mounted folder and im having a very hard time getting it to work
[01:35] <sethk> E_Presly, hmm, sounds like your /dev directory might be screwed up.  or part of the kernel.
[01:35] <sethk> aaron_, do you mean the mounted files?  the mount point?  more than one file in the mounted tree?
[01:35] <snerge> drarem if you want something "clearer" use PATH=${HOME}/folder1:${HOME}/folder2
[01:35] <drarem> ok thanks
[01:35] <rag> any install with netinstall ?
=== pc2 is now known as ce_sexx
[01:36] <rag> any refer to netinstall ? howto or something?
[01:36] <aaron_> i need to mount a ntfs windows drive into a linux folder and allow myself (aaron) to get into it.
[01:36] <mwe> "stack smashing" is that like a buffer overflow exploit or something?
[01:36] <sethk> E_Presly, most likely you can boot a live cd and fix it, but it would take some time to figure out exactly what to fix.
[01:36] <E_Presly> sethk: yes Im finding something about this in the forums, Im not at that computer atm but Im gonna try it tomorrow.
[01:36] <khermans> aaron_, mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows
[01:36] <sethk> aaron_, ok, well, first of all, ntfs is generally read only.  to get write access, you have to monkey around with the install quite a bit.
[01:36] <snerge> brb, kvirc switch
[01:36] <khermans> mwe, wtf
[01:36] <sethk> E_Presly, ok.  we can't really be very specific, there are too many possibilities
[01:36] <rag> howto netinstall
[01:37] <Athanasius> does anybody have problems with edgy and crossover office
[01:37] <docuk2> am i right in understanding that ubuntu doesnt use bootsplash, it uses usplash?
[01:37] <sethk> rag, use debian
[01:37] <Athanasius> I am
[01:37] <mwe> khermans: ?
[01:37] <khermans> mwe, why you asking about stack smashing in here
[01:37] <kitche> docuk2: yes you are correct
[01:37] <E_Presly> sethk: yes but I hope that I only have to modify the grub list
[01:37] <sethk> Athanasius, I've talked to a couple of other people reporting that.  specifically, what are you seeing?
[01:37] <mwe> khermans: I try to run sysinfo and it says "*** stack smashing detected ***:" and terminates.
[01:37] <DanSchnell> why when i type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart its says "Starting GNOME Display Manager...[FAIL] " ?
[01:37] <sethk> E_Presly, unlikely, unless you somehow changed it.  I assume you mean the grub config file, which is menu.lst
[01:37] <sladen> docuk2: correct
[01:38] <Athanasius> it says that the windows xp is not recognized
[01:38] <aaron_> it said only root can do the provided command
[01:38] <rag> Sethk, and with ubuntu? i know netinstall on debian , but with ubuntu equal?
[01:38] <Athanasius> the disk I mean
[01:38] <sethk> E_Presly, of course, something unlikely did happen, but it's pretty hard to change your menu.lst file accidentally without clobbering it entirely.
[01:38] <aaron_> that is why i need to login as root
[01:38] <khermans> mwe, you have grc installed?
[01:38] <sethk> rag, doesn't exist, AFAIK
[01:38] <tylerl> I just got my nVidia drivers set up.. but it says I'm using "default CRT monitor", and doesn't allow me to choose any resolution over 800x600.  How do I properly configure my Dell LCD?
[01:38] <sladen> DanSchnell: you need to   gdm stop    gdm start
[01:38] <khermans> aaron_, sudo -i
[01:38] <sethk> aaron_, you can run the command with sudo
[01:38] <rag> sethk: AFAIK? i dont know
[01:38] <sethk> aaron_, probably doing a mount, so try    sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/......
[01:38] <DanSchnell> sladen, that doesn't work either
[01:38] <mwe> khermans: I'll check. I just install sysinfo, asuming it would pull dependencies
[01:38] <sladen> aaron_: sudo <command you want to run as root>
[01:38] <sethk> rag, as far as I know.
[01:38] <sladen> DanSchnell: sudo killall -9 gdm
[01:38] <E_Presly> sethk: Yes but I saw that on the forums that it happend to some people. One of them even after booting windows on a dualboot...
[01:38] <rag> sethk, ok
[01:38] <sethk> rag, AFAIK, as far as I know
[01:39] <sethk> E_Presly, ok, still seems unlikely, but we'll see what happens.
[01:39] <docuk2> kitche, is there a way to use bootsplash instead of usplash?
[01:39] <rag> sethk, then, with netinstall , change image with ubuntu iso
[01:39] <sethk> E_Presly, it's easy to get confused about whether something is really caused by booting another o/s.  It almost never really is.
[01:39] <aaron_> alright, how do i set it so aaron has permission to access the folder now?
[01:39] <rag> sethk: but with pxe client, my client computer have a bios very rare
[01:39] <mwe> khermans: I installed it. same error still
[01:39] <BryanJK> Will someone help me reset tv time?
[01:40] <sethk> rag, ok, I've never actually tried it with BOOTP or PXE, so it might work.
[01:40] <blahh> Hi! i am making a fresh installation of edgy elf on my amd64.. i succesfully created my raid0 partition.. and made a /boot B ext3 in sda(sda1), so everything went well and installation continued, until setup had to install the bootloader, then i specify grub to be install there ( /dev/sda )... error msg received: excecuting grub install (/dev/sda) failed.. this is a fatal error... any 1 can help me there
[01:40] <Athanasius> crossover office says that my officexp disk is not compatible with my drive configuration
[01:40] <sethk> rag, can't really hurt to try.
[01:40] <khermans> mwe, installed what?
[01:40] <stevenx> hello.
[01:40] <dacableguy> its not called edgy ELF!!
[01:40] <docuk2> sladen, is there a way to use bootsplash instead of usplash?
[01:40] <stevenx> does anyone know if ubuntu can read ntsc drives?
[01:40] <tylerl> How do I configure my Dell LCD monitor on Ubuntu? It thinks I have a "default CRT".. can't config the resolution.
[01:40] <aaron_> seth? did you get my last message?
[01:40] <mwe> khermans: grc. you asked if I had it installed
[01:40] <khermans> mwe, i see your same error
=== marc2marc2 is now known as sanmarcxos
[01:40] <mwe> odd
=== sanmarcxos is now known as sanmarcos
[01:40] <mzli> <stevenx>yes
[01:40] <aaron_> how do i set the permission for the new mounted folder now?
[01:40] <khermans> mwe, i meant gr security -- you dont want grc installed
[01:41] <mzli> <stevenx>but can not write.
[01:41] <mwe> oh ;)
[01:41] <stevenx> mzli: thank you.
[01:41] <sethk> blahh, it's trying to install grub as if you didn't have a RAID setup, I think.  You should skip grub during the install, and then install grub later after booting the live CD
[01:41] <stevenx> mzli: k.
[01:41] <rag> sethk: i put with netboot, but it not start for me, i think i have to use a special disk for start interface network on computer client
[01:41] <BryanJK> Will someone help me RESET Tv Time's settings.. I messed something up now it crashes on startup
[01:41] <rag> sethk, thx for all, bye
[01:41] <sethk> aaron_, in the man page for mount, look at the NTFS section, the UID= and GID= options
[01:41] <blahh> sethk i dont know how to do this though :S
[01:41] <aaron_> what main page?
[01:41] <sethk> aaron_, but, you are probably dealing with a read-only mount, and you won't be able to write.  you can change who can read using UID= and GID=
[01:42] <blahh> now i have the alternate cd.. currently downloading the desktop one
[01:42] <mabus> how do I manually setup static ip, netmask, and gateway (and turn dhcp off) in ubuntu on the command line
[01:42] <sladen> docuk2: you're free to use bootsplash if you want.  One of the major reasons that Ubuntu doesn't ship it is that bootsplash requires kernel patches.
[01:42] <AaronCampbell> Does anyone know of a place that will detail some specific advantages (preferrably also disadvantages) of Edgy Eft over Fedora 6? (I'm trying to decide which to install)
[01:42] <docuk2> sladen, oh hrmmm - i just quite like the verbose mode of bootsplash
[01:42] <sethk> blahh, you mean, how to install grub?  you can cheat and install grub onto a cd, then set the machine up to boot from cd.  If you don't mind leaving that cd in the drive (assuming the machine has a cd drive and can boot from cd)
[01:43] <sethk> blahh, well, it's a new 64 bit box, so surely it can boot from cd, if it has one.
[01:43] <sladen> AaronCampbell: best thing might be to Google.  If you ask Fedora you'll get biased views.  If you ask here, you'll get biased views
[01:43] <mwe> khermans: I guess sysinfo is broken. maybe I should file a bug report
[01:43] <Fireal> what do I need for .avi files? (Divx)
[01:43] <blahh> i know how to boot from cd :)
[01:43] <blahh> i meant i dont have the live cd yet
[01:43] <tylerl> How do I configure my Dell LCD monitor on Ubuntu? It thinks I have a "default CRT".. can't config the resolution.
[01:43] <sethk> sladen, hey, I'm completey objective and neutral about everything.  :)
[01:43] <blahh> im running the alternate on for the raid
[01:43] <khermans> mwe, yes
[01:43] <BryanJK> Does anyone here use TV TIME?
[01:44] <AaronCampbell> sladen: I've googled it on/off for over a week, and ALL I get are "ubuntu does ___, ___, ___ and RULES Fedora"  Not even any good comparisons
=== ce_sexx is now known as VITA
[01:44] <sethk> tylerl, run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.  choose the middle level for monitor configuraiton difficulty.  then you can override.  say, for example, generic monitor that can do 1280x1024@60hz
[01:44] <blahh> do you think its bad to put /boot in the raid
[01:44] <blahh> and swap
[01:44] <sladen> AaronCampbell: perhaps you should go with those results then :)
[01:44] <sethk> blahh, swap you lose some performance, so that's a bit bad.  if you have another alternative for boot, you'll make your life a lot simpler by using it.
[01:44] <AaronCampbell> sladen: I'm just saying...I found no decent comparisons of the 2
[01:45] <sethk> AaronCampbell, do you have more specific questions?  we might be able to help, if you do.
[01:45] <sladen> docuk2: if you want verbose, remove 'quiet' from the kernel command line
[01:45] <sethk> AaronCampbell, there really is no real "which is better" answer, it depends on what you need, what you like, what hardware you have, etc.,etc.
[01:45] <sladen> AaronCampbell: sounds like it might be useful to do such a comparision yourself and post up the results
[01:45] <sethk> AaronCampbell, the truth is, for most purposes, it makes absolutely no difference whatsoever
[01:45] <sethk> AaronCampbell, which is why you don't find meaningful comparisons.  they are very close to identical in capabilities.
[01:45] <docuk2> sladen, is it possible to replicate a splash like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Knoppix-3.8-boot.png
[01:46] <dacableguy> AaronCampbell:  linux is really all about personal preference...some distros feel right, others dont...it really depends on you and what you like
[01:46] <sethk> AaronCampbell, that's not a popular answer here, perhaps, but it's a true one.
[01:46] <sethk> AaronCampbell, you really won't go wrong either way.  one thing, though
[01:46] <E_Presly> Can diffrent linux share same /boot partition? I was thinking about having both edgy and dapper.
[01:46] <jerryb> what package should I use with dapper to work with my ipod?
[01:46] <rooti1> hi, when i installed ubuntu, i had to configure some things that went into the xorg.conf ... and the system automatically detected my devices ... how can i do this again ? i screwed up my config, is there a way ?
[01:46] <sethk> AaronCampbell, #ubuntu is _definitely_ better than #fedora.  which can make a difference.
[01:46] <AaronCampbell> sethk: I'm a web programmer.  Mostly PHP.  I run a lot of Virtual Machines via VMWare, and I use a lot of Java apps (Eclipse, Zend IDE, etc)
[01:46] <sladen> docuk2: remove 'splash' from the kernel command line if you want text
[01:46] <dacableguy> E_Presly  - no, too many differences...you would have to dual boot
[01:46] <meheren> is there a command to show all disks... (hard drive cd floppy usb firewire...)
[01:46] <docuk2> sladen, right but i mean with the colors and images etc
[01:47] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I moved from fedora to ubuntu about 6 months ago, primarily because ubuntu does a better job for me with wireless lan setup.
[01:47] <sethk> AaronCampbell, for the kind of development you are talking about, there is really little difference.
[01:47] <jerryb> mheren fdisk -l
[01:47] <AaronCampbell> sethk: well, this is for my desktop...no wireless, but it does have 2 gigabit NICs
[01:47] <jerryb> meheren fdisk -l
[01:47] <sladen> docuk2: yes, the LSB init scripts could be modified.  Perhaps google to see if anyone has already done that
[01:47] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I have ubuntu here.  Some of my work machines are fedora because I don't choose the distro for all of them.
[01:48] <jerryb> all: what package should I use with dapper to work with my ipod?
[01:48] <meheren> jerryb, thx!
[01:48] <kuto2> how to install cde?
[01:48] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I think the ubuntu package manager is significantly better.
[01:48] <wastrel> ubunto
[01:48] <kitche> 4
[01:48] <E_Presly> dacableguy: Yes I was thinking about dualbooting but I have seperat boot partition and thought they couyld share?
[01:48] <dacableguy> jerryb:  you can use amarok, gtkpod...um...
[01:48] <kitche> umm stupid cat
[01:48] <AaronCampbell> sethk: any reason why?
[01:48] <sethk> AaronCampbell, and I would go with ubuntu, but, of course, I'm in #ubuntu and rarely in #fedora.
[01:48] <kuto2> please how do i install cde?
[01:48] <sethk> AaronCampbell, you mean why the package  manager is better?
[01:48] <kuto2> please how do i install cde?
[01:48] <AaronCampbell> sethk: yes
[01:48] <docuk2> sladen, i tried googling but am unsuccessful - you have any tips for the keywords? should i include 'lsb' for example?
[01:48] <Fireal> ALL:  what can play avi files, Divx is for windows?
[01:48] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I've found that rpm is more brittle.  It's quite easy to foul up the package database, and quite difficult to recover.
[01:48] <chorse> AaronCampbell: well, you can't really compare a sexy young girl with an old man with a beer belly and  a red hat
[01:49] <sethk> AaronCampbell, recovery is also quite difficult with dpkg, but it's less prone to breakage.
[01:49] <snerge> I have to agree with sethk
[01:49] <sladen> docuk2: lsb-init ubuntu color
[01:49] <dacableguy> E_Presly - i have never seen 2 distros share a boot partition...pretty sure you cant
[01:49] <Toma-> Fireal: xine, gxine, totem, mplayer? take your pick. just make sure you have w32codecs installed
=== Cre[a] tiveEmb[a]  is now known as CreativeEmbassy
[01:49] <Fireal> have all of 'em, think I should reinstall the w32codecs?
[01:49] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I really have no ax to grind, but it's partly a matter of personal preference, and so not quantifiable
[01:50] <kuto2> pls how do i install cde in ubuntu
[01:50] <snerge> sethk: and we're not even speaking about upgrading a 1 year old mysql ... :P
[01:50] <Toma-> Fireal: yeh. what type of divx is it?
[01:50] <AaronCampbell> thanks.  Now I just have to decide between KDE and Gnome
[01:50] <sladen> Fireal: have you followed one of the guides about installing extra stuff.  Are you on amd64 for instance?
[01:50] <Fireal> p.s. I own a copy of XP so I'm good legally
[01:50] <Toma-> kuto2: you actually want cde?
[01:50] <sladen> Toma-: divx == MPEG4
[01:50] <sethk> AaronCampbell, that's a real emotional issue for many people.  I prefer KDE, but I'm a definite minority in this channel.
[01:50] <chorse> Fireal: install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg and use totem.
[01:50] <Toma-> sladen: divx, xvid, divx4, 5 etc
[01:51] <sladen> AaronCampbell: Which colour do you prefer, Blue, or Brown?
[01:51] <wastrel> install both
[01:51] <Toma-> lots of perversions of the original! :D
[01:51] <sethk> Fireal, I have no idea if owning a windows license is legally relevant.
[01:51] <wastrel> sladen:  there's blue versions of the human theme :] 
[01:51] <AaronCampbell> sethk: that's because you would belong in #kubuntu right?  Is it better to install Ubuntu, and add KDE?  Or just use Kubuntu (are the ANY differences?
[01:51] <sladen> Toma-: they are all just MPEG4 *encoders*.  Any MPEG4 decoder will display the result fine
[01:51] <sethk> Fireal, knowing microsoft, they've most likely written the license in such a way that it isn't relevant.  Not that anyone is going to hunt you down for installing codecs.
[01:51] <E_Presly> dacableguy: Ok thanks
[01:52] <danl> I have a question concerning servlets and tomcat, when you deploy your servlet, does it deploy all class files in the classes folder, or does it only deploy the one on the web.xml file?
[01:52] <sethk> AaronCampbell, no differences at all.  I install the base ubuntu, without a desktop, and then install kde.
[01:52] <sethk> AaronCampbell, and my box says "kubuntu" on the splash screen.  the only difference is the default desktop.
[01:52] <Fireal> sladen: nope reg processor, totem didn't work
[01:52] <AaronCampbell> sethk: got it...I have both CDs....but I guess it doesn't matter
[01:52] <aggrimes> all - (sort of new to linux and ubuntu) I have Ubuntu dual booting with Mac OSX on a G4 powerbook - all worked fine and great, until I installed Network Manager.  Now, it seems to be hijacking all my system resources, or something - I can't open any other programs, not even the system monitor, not even a terminal; is there a keystroke for emergency kill in Ubuntu, or something like that?  Anything else I should do?  thanks -
[01:53] <kuto2> is there CDE for ubuntu
[01:53] <sethk> AaronCampbell, never hurts to have a backup.  :)
[01:53] <sethk> kuto2, there are some CDE for linux systems, although I have to admit it's been about two years since I saw one.
[01:53] <Vuen> hey #ubuntu, why is aMSN so ugly? the fonts are all jagged and the dialogs are blocky.
[01:53] <sethk> kuto2, do you want CDE because you are familiar with using it?
[01:54] <sethk> kuto2, the CDE implementations that I have seen are not free.
[01:54] <wastrel> aggrimes:  you might try ctrl-alt-backspace to kill X, since network-manager was started by gnome it should kill the daughter process.
[01:54] <AaronCampbell> sethk: I suppose I might as well use the Kubuntu CD though...if there's no difference.  I know that about a year ago when I had to switch to Windows, I preferred KDE to gnome...just liked the feel better.  Not much else to it.
[01:54] <sethk> kuto2, KDE sort of started out as CDE for linux, but that was many years ago and not really relevant.
[01:54] <wastrel> aggrimes:  or try ctrl-alt-f1 to drop to terminal, in case it's just X windows that isn't working.
[01:54] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I like the fact that I can resize windows with alt-right-click
[01:55] <sethk> AaronCampbell, that probably sounds a bit dumb, but it makes a big difference to me.
[01:55] <sethk> AaronCampbell, I'm told that there is a way to get gnome to do that, by the way, but I've never tracked it down.
[01:55] <aggrimes> wastrel - how do I start X back up once I kill it?
[01:56] <AaronCampbell> I'm just dying to have multiple desktops again.  I run 2 monitors, and I still feel limited on Windwos...because of the lack of good multi-desktop implementation
[01:56] <sethk> AaronCampbell, KDE has the dual desktop configuration built into their config dialogs, which is a nice feature
[01:56] <sethk> AaronCampbell, both gnome and kde do multiple logical desktops, of course.
[01:56] <wastrel> aggrimes:  it should restart automatically, but if not you'll get a terminal, just login & type startx  or sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start
[01:57] <wastrel> how's litestep anymore for 'doze?
[01:57] <Comrade_S> litestep is now too bloated
[01:57] <wastrel> played around with it in 98 or so when i had win95 heh
[01:58] <blahh> sethk if i reinstall ubuntu from my alternate cd then put in the livecd would u help me out setting up my bootloader
[01:59] <sethk> blahh, sure, I'll try, and so will other people here.  If you are installing it to somewhere not RAID, I can surely help you.  Installing to RAID, I can't really promise that I can make it work.
[01:59] <aggrimes> wastrel - okay, thanks; one other thing - Network Manager was added to system > preferences > sessions >startup programs upon install.  Does that mean it'll just start back up once X is restarted?
[01:59] <Toma-> AaronCampbell: e17 has some fancy multiple desktop settings
[01:59] <blahh> no ill do the same patern ill create a /boot outside the raid

[01:59] <AaronCampbell> sethk: and the only CD that I should need to install (K)Ubuntu is the 6.10-desktop-i386 (assuming i386 is right for me)?  No DVD or 5 CD set?

[02:00] <sethk> AaronCampbell, not needed, it will download everything else from the 'net.
[02:00] <ubuntu> I have a question
[02:00] <aggrimes> is there a way to edit the startup programs outside of X?

=== ubuntu is now known as secretum
[02:00] <wastrel> aggrimes:  ~/.config/autostart/  is where these things are kept, I believe.   if you manage to drop to terminal (ctrl-alt-F1 ?) you coudl remove it ...
[02:00] <sethk> aggrimes, of course.  You can do _everything_ both inside and outside X
[02:01] <secretum> I wasnt asking if i could ask
[02:01] <mzli> <aggrimes>what do you want?
[02:01] <secretum> just stating
[02:01] <sethk> aggrimes, one of the big advantages to a properly layered system.  (As opposed to a certain improperly layered system we might mention.)
[02:01] <Station> has anyone gotten ubuntu to display at 1320x768 resolution?
[02:02] <sethk> Station, yes, but whether it can be done depends on the graphics adapter.  It's either perfectly simple, or impossible.
[02:02] <sethk> Station, and since you are apparently having problems, I'd guess the latter.
[02:02] <Jhonathan> server irc.bluenet.com.br
[02:02] <dacableguy> secretum:  ask away
[02:02] <sethk> Station, to be sure, run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, choose the middle difficulty level for monitor configuration.  that will list all available resolutions.
[02:02] <Station> graphics adapter?  I just recently enabled my nvidia card, so i figured it wouldn't be too hard
[02:02] <blahh> just need to burn the desktop cd
[02:03] <sethk> Station, shouldn't be hard at all.
[02:03] <aggrimes> Anybody know if on a Mac keyboard the option key = alt in Linux?
[02:03] <sethk> Station, run that program, and you'll see the list of available resolutions.  then select and unselect the ones you want and don't want.
[02:03] <secretum> I am testing the live cd right now, both edgy and dapper, but I have a problem.  Edgy will not let me switch to my normal resolution, 1280x1024, where dapper lets me.  I was wondering if I installed Edgy, would it make me use 1024x768, or is there a fix?
[02:03] <Zer0Her0> aggrimes: yes
[02:04] <aggrimes> okay - thanks all
[02:04] <sethk> secretum, once you install you'll be able to do it in edgy.
[02:04] <Toma-> secretum: the live cd is fairly limited with resolutions.
[02:04] <secretum> Oh, OK, thanks

[02:12] <crimsun> byteshack: all the bug reports against alsa-driver and linux-source-2.6.17[ pertaining to audio] ?
[02:12] <sethk> Station, that means that the nvidia driver is not reporting it as a possible resolution.
[02:12] <sethk> Station, do you know if you are using the nvidia proprietary driver, or the open source nv driver?
[02:12] <secretum> how, because it gives an error when i click on it in the file manager
[02:13] <Akuma_> anyone knows why i can boot the x86 cd but not x64? cpu = amd turion 64
[02:13] <sethk> Station, regardless, if one doesn't give you the resolution you want, try the other
[02:13] <Station> damn, i assume it then becomes extremely difficult, if even possible, to get it to work.
[02:13] <weezl> great
[02:13] <tylerl> I just edited my xorg.conf file, and added 1280x1024 to each of my display settings, however it loads in 1024x768 and wont give me the option to put it higher. Why?
[02:13] <Station> try the other what/
[02:13] <sethk> Station, the other driver.  there are two
[02:13] <sethk> Station, the open source driver, nv, doesn't do 3d.
[02:13] <secretum> sethk: how, because it gives an error when i click on it in the file manager
[02:13] <Akuma_> tylerl: did you try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
[02:13] <sethk> Station, the other one, named nvidia, does 3d and isn't open source.
[02:14] <tylerl> Akuma_: Yeah.  I'll do it again I guess
=== _Cas is now known as cas_
[02:14] <Station> the nvidia driver is what I have installed
[02:14] <sethk> secretum, either run the file manager as root (using sudo), or, more easily, bring up a terminal window and use the mount command with sudo
[02:14] <Akuma_> tylerl: thats what finally set the right resolution in my case... just though i'd point it out
[02:14] <secretum> thanks
[02:14] <Station> with the 3d.  I didn't know the nv driver didn't do 3d.  Interesting.
[02:15] <Akuma_> tylerl: when it asks for the resolution, make sure you select only the one you want...
[02:15] <Station> I suppose I may have to settle for 1280x768, then.
=== Echtor`off is now known as Echtor2oo3

[02:16] <lullabud> wow... ubuntu supports GFS.  freakin rad
[02:16] <LGKeiz> uhm I got a question, how would I setup my wireless connection to work on ubuntu, -is completely new-
[02:17] <Akuma_> tylerl: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution
[02:17] <Crescendo> GFS being Google File System...?
[02:17] <sethk> secretum, if your windows partition is the first partition on IDE Primary master, you would do something like this:   mkdir /mnt/ntfs         then, on the next line            sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/ntfs
=== marc2marc2 is now known as sanmarcos

[02:17] <jshadow> does anyone know how to use the tap-plugins with gstreamer, or to what extent this is possible?
[02:17] <Crescendo> Ahh.
[02:17] <lullabud> Crescendo:  the RHEL enterprise touted clustering filesystem
[02:17] <lullabud> freakin aaaaawesome
[02:17] <sethk> secretum, you probably need sudo with the mkdir command also:   sudo mkdir /mnt/ntfs; sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/ntfs
[02:17] <LGKeiz> Im getting error  SIOCGIFFLAGS error: no such device, could anyone please help me/
[02:18] <LGKeiz> when trying to setup my wireless connection ;p
[02:18] <sethk> secretum, you mount to any empty directory, so the name /mnt/ntfs is just an example.  the /dev/hda1 part has to match.  /dev/hda1 assumes first partition on first IDE disk.
[02:18] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  that would happen when you're trying to do wireless networking on a device that doesn't support wireless.
[02:18] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  try `iwconfig` and see what it tells you.
[02:18] <Akuma_> anyone knows why i can boot the x86 cd but not x64? cpu = amd turion 64
[02:19] <secretum> sethk: this comes back  mount: special device /dev/hda1 does not exist
[02:19] <LGKeiz> lullabud this is a laptop =o sec
[02:19] <lullabud> sethk:  are you sure it's /dev/hda?  could be /dev/hdb or /dev/sda
[02:19] <sethk> secretum, ok, then it's not the first partition on IDE primary master.  IDE primary master may or may not exist (it could be a cd drive, and not have a partition table)
[02:19] <sethk> secretum, try /dev/sda1, which is good for first partition on the first SATA disk
[02:20] <sethk> secretum, or as lullabud said, might be the second drive.  do you know?
[02:20] <LGKeiz> eth0 - no wireless  extensions, what do I do?

[02:21] <tylerl> Akuma_: My laptop is docked, so I can use this Dell LCD.. i wonder what will happen if i undock
[02:21] <secretum> sethk: i am pretty sure tat it is the first drive, i will try /dev/sda1
[02:21] <tylerl> Akuma_: Will it use the same settings?
[02:21] <secretum> that
[02:21] <Station> Should I try using the nv driver?  I'm not going to to need 3d support.  I'll still get the benefits of the graphics card when I'm playing video, right?
[02:21] <sethk> secretum, ok.
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor`off
[02:21] <Akuma_> tylerl: try it

[02:22] <bobbyd> hi
[02:22] <sethk> secretum, you should also be able to find it in the file manager gui
[02:22] <secretum> ok
[02:22] <LGKeiz> So how would I fix it lullabud lol
[02:22] <lullabud> secretum:  try `sudo cfdisk -P s /dev/hda`
[02:22] <sethk> secretum, go to /, click mnt, etc.
[02:22] <tylerl> Akuma_: Since this is an LCD, is it possible to set a separate refresh rate for Vertical and Horizontal?
[02:22] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  i don't know, what did it say with iwconfig?
[02:22] <sethk> lullabud, I think he said it mounted after you told him to try sda1
[02:23] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  did it say anything had wireless?

[02:34] <LGKeiz> dullard - I done man iwconfig but I still don't really understand what I need to do Lol..
[02:34] <sethk> dullard, that will give you tons of output, but it sounds as if you are knowledgeable enough to use it.
[02:34] <sethk> dullard, what you would do, then, is    grep ld  strace.gcc*
[02:34] <sethk> dullard, that will show you all the directories it is trying to find ld in.
[02:35] <dullard> sethk, I'm not as knowlegable as all that but I'll give it a go... shouldn't it just errm work?
[02:35] <sethk> dullard, I don't think so.  try it, though, I could be wrong.
[02:36] <LGKeiz> It's telling me Operation is not permitted..
[02:36] <sethk> LGKeiz, using sudo?  sudo iwconfig ............

[02:46] <ryanakca> how do I change the expiry date on a gpg subkey?
[02:46] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, thank you very much :-D
[02:46] <s|k> how do I see what connections there are
[02:46] <s|k> to my computer?
[02:46] <sethk> suckamc, error 18 applies only to IDE drives, and only to older machines with brain dead BIOS.
[02:46] <sethk> s|k, netstat -a | egrep '^tcp'
[02:46] <suckamc> sethk: positive. considering its its hooked up by sata connections...
[02:46] <suckamc> I'm getting it in stage 1.5
[02:46] <Toma-> The_Dark_Side_Of: np. you need to install it then run 'apt-file update' then apt-file search filename.wow
[02:46] <s|k> sethk: thanks :)
[02:46] <sethk> suckamc, then the error number is bogus.
[02:46] <s|k> ssh isn't tcp though is it?
[02:46] <ryanakca> drbombay43_lapto: make sure you have a seperate partition for /home... how big is the HD?
[02:46] <sethk> s|k, yes, it is
[02:46] <fukegirls> any girls want see a big cock size 11 inch
[02:47] <s|k> oh okay thanks
[02:47] <sethk> s|k, ssh uses tcp port 22, by default
[02:47] <s|k> oh right
[02:47] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, hehehe.. yep.. i noticed it ain't on my system :-P
[02:47] <s|k> what is up with that fukegirls :/
[02:47] <sethk> s|k, if you use n, as in   netstat -na, you can grep for 22
[02:47] <durt> xmms shows a little yellow box with the name of the current song in the upper right corner of my screen. How do I get rid of it?

[02:48] <BDeeJay> where can I find a tool to change the type of my connection?  it should be wireless and not wired!
[02:48] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, if very useful.. should be included in synaptic/aptitude and by default on the system.... it would be ncie for other distros package system to have something similar
[02:48] <drbombay43_lapto> ryanakca, the home partition is a nfs from home gentoo server

[02:48] <Hobbsee> nalioth: i got him
[02:48] <sethk> nalioth, Hobbsee thanks
[02:48] <Toma-> The_Dark_Side_Of: its more of a tool for development, so not really needed

[02:49] <digitalhav0c> is a there anyway to get rid of the of the away , connect mesg?
[02:49] <BDeeJay> no solution?
[02:49] <sethk> Akuma_, no
[02:50] <sethk> Akuma_, you have to use something like gparted or partition magic to make space
[02:50] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, i think it will be very useful for me.. i'm always looking for the "i provide this" package :-P. ohh. btw.... do you now if gnome-libs-devel has another name un ubuntu?
[02:50] <LGKeiz> urgh ok
[02:50] <LGKeiz> I get ACcess Point: invalid
[02:50] <LGKeiz> what do I do with that?
[02:50] <Akuma_> sethk: i see. thanks!
[02:50] <tyler> HI
[02:50] <Toma-> The_Dark_Side_Of: sometihng like libgnome-dev id say?

[02:51] <drbombay43_lapto> ryanakca, I also have windows installed on sdb also a 36
[02:51] <sethk> dullard, try   grep -l ld strace.gcc*          hopefully that will show you one, or two filenames.  you can paste all four if you like, but only the ones with ld are relevant at the moment.
[02:51] <s|k> say sethk thanks for your help so far, I'm just curious though how do I kill one of the connections now that I see it?
[02:51] <tyler> that was a accident
[02:51] <tyler> sorry
[02:51] <tyler> 'dont get mad at me its my first time on this chat
[02:51] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, i installed libgnome2-dev but didnt provide the file i actually need (gnomeConf.sh), do you think installing libgnome-dev my provide it?
[02:51] <sethk>  s|k you can  do   netstat -nap | grep whatever.        to find the process.  the p in -nap means list processes.  that will tell you what process you can kill to disconnect a particular connection
[02:51] <ryanakca> how do I change the expiry date on a gpg subkey?
[02:52] <s|k> oh thanks sethk  :)
[02:52] <tyler> do any of u guys no any good screen recorders?
[02:52] <Toma-> The_Dark_Side_Of: firstly, what are you building? and have you tired apt-file yet?
[02:52] <LjL> !info istanbul | tyler
[02:52] <ubotu> istanbul: Desktop session recorder. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 47 kB, installed size 380 kB
[02:52] <Toma-> tyler: xvidcap?
[02:53] <Station> well, i've somehow managed to get a widescreen resolution set, even though it's slightly too wide for the screen and the very left edge of my dektop panels are off the screen.
[02:53] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, i am building an app called "guituner", apt-file is downloading stuff yet...
[02:53] <dullard> sethk, I pasted a more interesting looking one on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30494/
[02:53] <dullard> sethk, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30495/ even
[02:53] <sethk> dullard, ok
[02:53] <Toma-> The_Dark_Side_Of: just wait for apt-file ;D
[02:53] <tyler> hi i have been havin trouble installing stuff can any of u help?
[02:54] <s|k> I had to use sudo to find the processes :0
[02:54] <The_Dark_Side_Of> Toma-, hehehe.. allright :-),.. and again.. thank you a lot for your help.
[02:54] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: gtkguitune?
[02:54] <Toma-> np
[02:54] <tyler> plz help
[02:54] <apokryphos> !helpme
[02:54] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:54] <BDeeJay> where should I start to find If I get wired connection instead of wireless connection with my usb wireless adapter?
[02:55] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, no... "guituner"... i find gtkguitune a bit innacurate.....
[02:55] <sethk> dullard, do you see all those attempts to start the ld program?  It sounds like, perhaps, you don't have the ld program installed that gcc is expecting.  Because it's legal to have multiple versions of ld on a box (usually for cross compiling but possibly for having more than one version of the compiler installed), the path to ld is compiled into gcc
[02:55] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, i am trying other stuff for tuning..
[02:55] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: suppose you tried tuneroid as well, it's in the edgy repos
[02:55] <sethk> dullard, so, if that _particular_ ld is not on the machine, it will fail, even though there may be a perfectly good, usable ld in /usr/bin
[02:55] <sethk> dullard, see if /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu exists.
[02:55] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: err sorry i meant lingot - tuneroid is another, for KDE, and not in the repos =)
[02:55] <suckamc> any ideas why Grub would be throwing Error 18 on set 1.5 for an sata drive?
[02:56] <Cuog_422> i cannot save files to my own directory in ubuntu, is there a command to give my user more permission?
[02:56] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, ohh no.. but you came in a very good time :-D let me check out.... altough i never heard of that (or saw about it no the net)
[02:56] <dullard> sethk, sounds like a reasonable explaination... but how did that happen??
[02:56] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, so.. lingot is the one?? does it uses gtk, qt or console?
[02:56] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: gtk
[02:56] <deviated> wow
[02:56] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, nice..
[02:56] <LGKeiz> Who here can help me setup a wireless connection, I have a laptop with ubuntu installed, I click activate, then I click the icon where the system clock I active the  Wireless connection eth1 then I click the icon, and it gives me no such device, and than it saids the wireless connection is not active..
[02:56] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, let me grab it :-D
[02:57] <sethk> dullard, I'm not sure.  possibly because you installed gcc first.  If you install build-essential, you get a consistent set of compiler/binutils.  However, the correct binutils should have been installed as a dependency of gcc, so that doesn't really explain it.
[02:57] <ryanakca> how do I change the expiry date on a gpg subkey?
[02:57] <sethk> dullard, try to install build-essential with the reinstall flag.
[02:57] <sethk> dullard, let me look that up...
[02:57] <KHatfull> Can anyone stomach an nvidia driver question?
[02:57] <dullard> sethk, that sounds sensible
[02:57] <sethk> dullard, sudo apt-get --reinstall install build-essential
[02:57] <KHatfull> Greetings BTW, just came over from #ubuntuforums
[02:58] <sethk> dullard, there are other flags to force things to be installed, even if the package manager thinks they are already there.  but try that one first, it's the simplest
[02:58] <deviated> sethk: are you still there, while reinstalling it via alternate cd seems like it didnt had any trouble installing grub this time but id like to make sure everything is ok, can you help me to check it out like if the raid and grub are installed properly
[02:58] <Akuma_> how big should the linux-swap be?
[02:58] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: http://zyzstar.kosoru.com/?tuneroid has other links as well
[02:58] <sethk> dullard, and also, because I install gcc from source, I'm not the best one to track down package manager dependency issues.
[02:58] <LGKeiz> Who here can help me setup a wireless connection, I have a laptop with ubuntu installed, I click activate, then I click the icon where the system clock I active the  Wireless connection eth1 then I click the icon, and it gives me no such device, and than it saids the wireless connection is not active... O
[02:58] <LGKeiz> I read man iwconfig
[02:58] <Austin_> is there a way to save this channel as a favorite
[02:58] <sethk> deviated, sure, I can try, and other people here will also, but if it's working, what's to check?
[02:59] <Andypat10> !sound
[02:59] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[02:59] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: (but as far as the stuff that's in the repos is concerned, i think lingot and gtkguitune is all there is)
[02:59] <sethk> deviated, the best check of grub is, if the machine boots, grub is ok.  :)
[02:59] <Cadteach> Hi All
[02:59] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, thank you very very much dude.... i never saw lingot anywhere..
[02:59] <deviated> i wanna make sure my raid0 is ok and grub is loading the raid correctly.. im just a little bit septik since it didnt work the 3 times i tried before and suddenly it worked
[02:59] <deviated> what about the raid
[02:59] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, i saw it.. it seems very fine.. and configurable too.. let me hook the mic and try it..
[03:00] <deviated> is there anyway to check it out
[03:00] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: well, "apt-cache search tuner" does show it ;-P
[03:00] <del4> i need to edit my xorg.conf to add my video cards, how do i access it please?
[03:00] <kamui> does they synaptic entry in my xorg.conf what allows my touchpad's side scrolling feature to work?  Can I remove it?  I think its whats making my touchpad move erraticly
[03:00] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, never did that (ok.. hammer me now :-P)... hehe.. just still with the old references i knew from the past
[03:00] <dullard> sethk, that didn't fix it... *blub* how can the compiler be broken
[03:00] <lullabud> kamui:  there's a tool to edit the behavior of the synaptic touch pad.
[03:01] <totall_6_7> here is a question for anyone who may care to answer. I am going to show something that every script seems to have. Can someone tell me why it says unstable

[03:01] <Cadteach> del4: Do you know which text editor you use?
[03:01] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, wow dude.. tuneroid looks real good on the screenshot..
[03:01] <|thunder> is there a way to 'AutoMount' all available hard drives while running live-cd ?
[03:01] <lullabud> Yourname: apt-cdrom

[03:01] <LGKeiz> thats what it saids
[03:01] <sethk> dullard, pretty easily, actually.
[03:01] <del4> cadteach i am using gedit
[03:01] <Yourname> lullabud: Lemme try, thanks.
[03:01] <LGKeiz> I typed it out manually, someone gotta help me get this working.. >.>
[03:01] <sethk> dullard, at this point I should defer to someone who knows the package manager better than I do.
[03:02] <Yourname> lullabud: It says E: Invalid operation install
[03:02] <sethk> dullard, I assume you did the standard stuff, as in, removing comments from repository lines, and running sudo apt-get update    ?
[03:02] <Cuog_422> how do i give a user permissions to read/write etc to any file?
[03:02] <Cadteach> Do you know where the config resides?
[03:02] <suckamc> sethk: any ideas on that boot error?
[03:02] <lullabud> Yourname:  no, you add the cdrom to the apt repository using apt-cdrom, then you install it with apt-get
[03:02] <LGKeiz> Heroes is on..
[03:02] <sethk> suckamc, I haven't had a chance to glance at the code yet.  Reinstalling grub is probably worth a try.
[03:02] <LjL> The_Dark_Side_Of: well look at this page if you want to try tuneroid out perhaps http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtuneroid/  -  it should be the same as normal tuneroid, except it only depends on Qt and not on KDE
[03:03] <Yourname> lullabud: Lemme try, lol thanks.
[03:03] <Kingsqueak> Cuog_422: you set that by the permissions on the files/directories themselves or you run the command as root
[03:03] <dullard> sethk, I think I may as well reinstall the system and start things off with apt-get install build-essentials
[03:03] <suckamc> sethk: i have tried reinstalling grub.. 3 times now
[03:03] <Cuog_422> ok what command
[03:03] <quintin> Why can I not set files to open with mplayer?  they all want to open with toem
[03:03] <deviated> is there any little command that will return the raid status
[03:03] <lullabud> Cuog_422:  your best bet is to give that user sudo access.
[03:03] <quintin> totem
[03:03] <quintin> I f**ing hate totem
[03:03] <del4> cadteach i am just running a search for it now
[03:03] <sethk> suckamc, ok.  if twice doesn't work, neither will three times.
[03:03] <Kingsqueak> Cuog_422: chmod is the command
[03:03] <Cuog_422> ok
[03:03] <apokryphos> quintin: language please
[03:04] <quintin> apokryphos: bite me.
[03:04] <sethk> suckamc, there are some known problems with sata, but this one doesn't sound like any of them to me.
[03:04] <Kingsqueak> Cuog_422: for a text file, to set it so anyone can read or write it, chmod 666 file.txt
[03:04] <totall_6_7> quintin: what files do you wish to open with mplayer
[03:04] <sethk> suckamc, did you google, check the posted ubuntu problems?   Is this with edgy, by the way?
[03:04] <del4> hmm i am not able to find xorg.conf by searching for it..

[03:04] <The_Dark_Side_Of> LjL, again.. thanks a lot.. i'll check them :-D

[03:08] <protocol1> should I unzip it first?
[03:08] <Austin_> thanks all
[03:08] <JonMarkGo> I have a pretty simple question, how does Ubuntu Server 6.10 compare to Mandriva 2007 as a stable, secure small server?
[03:08] <sethk> deviated, let me look
[03:09] <whatthedeuce> Hey.  Is it possible to install ubuntu on a low memory laptop?  It can't load up gnome on the live cd, so I can't install it from there.  I plan on using fluxbox
[03:09] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  so, your AP has WEP.  is it made by a key or a passphrase?
[03:09] <LGKeiz> When I click the icon in the system tray  a error "please contact your system administrator to resolve the following problem. "SIOCGIFFLAGS: error: No such device
[03:09] <quintin_> Who is the fagtron that banned me, and why?
[03:09] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  some AP's do passphrases differently, so it's best to use a key.
[03:09] <Kingsqueak> protocol1: tar jxvf <file.tar.bz2> will extract it in the directory you are in
[03:09] <sethk> deviated, definitely, yes.
[03:09] <deviated> wooohooo
[03:09] <LGKeiz> lullabud a key
[03:09] <LGKeiz> like
[03:09] <LGKeiz> 6183261832 ( which is our zip code )
[03:09] <Kingsqueak> protocol1: then look for a README or INSTALL file in the directory it makes to figure out what to do next
[03:09] <LGKeiz> well 2 times
[03:09] <LGKeiz> 61832
[03:09] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  ooooh, your system thinks there are no wireless extensions.
[03:09] <del4> how do i find the name of my ati video card driver so i can create a device? is it in here? ->0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 AS [Radeon 95 50] 
[03:09] <del4> 0000:01:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 ?? [Radeon 9550]  (Se condary)
[03:09] <protocol1> Kingsqueak, thx
[03:09] <LGKeiz> lullabud: what do I do then lol
[03:09] <bimberi> whatthedeuce: yes, do a server install from the alternate cd.  then use the CLI to install flux
[03:10] <deviated> well ill go and explore my new buntu world thx guys
[03:10] <bimberi> whatthedeuce: by the way, the 'server' install might be called 'minimal'.  I'm not sure
[03:10] <daddius> anyone even play mp3 music?
[03:10] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  `cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep -B1 wlan`
[03:10] <kitche> !mp3 daddius
[03:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mp3 daddius - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:10] <lullabud> do you see anything there?
[03:10] <kitche> !mp3|daddius
[03:10] <ubotu> daddius: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[03:11] <daddius> thanks
[03:11] <LGKeiz> hold on..
[03:11] <Toma-> how do you get spell checking in abiword?
[03:11] <pmj> I have problems booting into an installation of Ubuntu. Depending on how I add/remove physical drives in my computer and enable/disable them in the BIOS, I get as far as grub "loading stage1.5", grub error 21 or a blinking marker., and there it stops. Can someone help me understand grub a little better?
[03:11] <del4> ARRGH!!! did it HAVE to flood?! i just want to set up ubuntu! stupid rain.
[03:11] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  oops, that should be -A1
[03:11] <del4> <-- being evacuated tonight :D
[03:12] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  not -B1
[03:12] <whatthedeuce> bimberi: Thanks.  Will it install anything extra (apache, php, mysql, etc)?
[03:12] <Kingsqueak> del4: where y'at, that sucks?
[03:12] <LGKeiz> lullabud: k it saids auto wlan0 and iface wlan0 inet dhcp
[03:12] <Yourname> lullabud: I'm doing sudo dhclient wlan0, but it seems to be doing DHCPDISCOVER on 255.255.255.255.. I want it on 255.255.255.0 How can I make it so?
[03:12] <LGKeiz> err
[03:12] <LGKeiz> yeah
[03:12] <LGKeiz> thats what it saids
[03:13] <flammenwurfer> is anybody using a laptop with a fingerprint reader?
[03:13] <lullabud> Yourname: you want 255.255.255.255
[03:13] <Yourname> lullabud: But my network is on 255.255.255.0
[03:13] <lullabud> Yourname: no, that's your subnet mask.
[03:13] <Crescendo> My clock seems to gain 30 minutes a week... and "Keep clock synced" doesn't seem to help.
[03:13] <LGKeiz> lullabud: so what do I do?
[03:13] <lullabud> yourname:  255.255.255.255 is the broadcast address for your network.
[03:13] <bimberi> whatthedeuce: I don't think so.  I haven't done such an install from the latest version though.  I doubt it though because that CD is intended for setting up desktop systems
[03:13] <Yourname> lullabud: Yeah, but it doesn't seem to work.. and that's why I thought maybe I need it to be on 255.255.255.0
[03:13] <lullabud> yourname: no, that's fine... that's not your problem.
[03:13] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: what does the log show on your dhcp server?
[03:14] <JonMarkGo> Any suggestions?
[03:14] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  that looks like it should be right...
[03:14] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: How do I check it?
[03:14] <Austin_> hey I have a question
[03:14] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: what is your dhcp server?  A linux box?
[03:14] <Austin_> I installed AIM for linux, but I cant find it
[03:14] <LGKeiz> lullabud: so..? I have no idea what do I do man =/ lol
[03:14] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: A router.
[03:14] <Crescendo> Austin_, why not use gAIM?
[03:14] <Austin_> idk
[03:14] <whatthedeuce> bimberi: Okay.  There are two cd's available, the "Alternate install CD", and the "Server install CD".  Which would you recommend?
[03:14] <Austin_> Interface for aim linux version is more familiar
[03:14] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: ah, will depend on the router, a web interface maybe if it's a wireless router, may have logs or a lease status indicator
[03:15] <foomonkey> what tools are available with Ubuntu to do system monitoring? I'm looking for a text-based tool, no GUI's
[03:15] <Crescendo> It'll run MSN and Yahoo as well as AIM.
[03:15] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Lemme check.. does it show in dmesg, or /var/log/mesages?
[03:15] <Crescendo> Hrm, if you're looking for AIM, try (at the command line) "locate aim"
[03:15] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: if you can log in, depending on the OS, /var/log/  somewhere
[03:15] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: are you familiar with setting up a network connection?
[03:15] <LGKeiz> ..err
[03:15] <meheren> is there a way to boot from the network?
[03:15] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: well, I'm here right ?
[03:15] <LGKeiz> wireless connection *
[03:15] <LGKeiz> sorry
[03:15] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  man, i'm not sure what the problem is.  looks like your gui tool is looking at the wrong adapter...
[03:15] <linux01> does anyone know how to get a sd media card reader on toshiba laptop to work?
[03:16] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: I only know the Intel chip and it's dead simple
[03:16] <meheren> or basically is there a way to boot my computer without a cdrom drive or a hard drive?
[03:16] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: One minute, please?
[03:16] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if you use ndiswrappers, I don't know anything about that
[03:16] <LGKeiz> lullabud: hmm
[03:16] <foomonkey> what tools are available with Ubuntu to do system monitoring? I'm looking for a text-based tool, no GUI's
[03:16] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: you should see a DHCPDISCOVER
[03:16] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: Im using Dell Intel, so it should be up your ally
[03:16] <meheren> foomonkey, top...?
[03:16] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: if you have grep on the router, just do   cd /var/log ; grep DHCPDISCOVER *
[03:17] <meheren> foomonkey never acually used it.. hehe
[03:17] <lullabud> LGKeiz:  what system is it that you're using?
[03:17] <Yourname> ok
[03:17] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: aye, that's what I have a D820, did you install network-manager and network-manager-gnome yet?
[03:17] <meheren> foomonkey, yeah top shows all active procceses
[03:17] <foomonkey> anyone know what this one is: http://www.flickr.com/photos/sog/279369235/
[03:17] <foomonkey> top is good but I like the one in that screenshot
[03:17] <Clinton__> !ie6
[03:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ie6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:17] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: nope because I don't have access to the internet on the laptop
[03:18] <LGKeiz> lullabud: uhh
[03:18] <flammenwurfer> Has anybody gotten their fingerprint reader working?
[03:18] <Clinton__> damnit
[03:18] <Clinton__> does anyonehave an install guide for ie6 on ubuntu?
[03:18] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you need to get those packages and install them, is this Dapper or Edgy?
[03:18] <LGKeiz> lullabud: defind 'system'
[03:18] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Also, I don't see nm-applet show me the wifi networks.. it did yesterday!
[03:18] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: .. Ubuntu ? *is new*
[03:18] <phargle> do you have the wire plugged into your wireless card?
[03:18] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: ahh you may not be 'up' properly if it isn't showing you the networks
[03:18] <foomonkey> no ideas on that screenshot? I guess I'll have to ask sogrady
[03:18] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: what have you changed since then, anything?
[03:19] <linux01> does anyone know how to get a sd media card reader on toshiba laptop to work?
[03:19] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Could you please help me out? And no, nothing changed.
[03:19] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: do   uname -a
[03:19] <Toma-> foomonkey: htop
[03:19] <Toma-> foomonkey: read the comments?
[03:19] <LGKeiz> GNU/Linux
[03:19] <LGKeiz> Just got it installed
[03:20] <LGKeiz> hmm
[03:20] <foomonkey> I didn't read the comments... <embarrassed/>
[03:20] <foomonkey> thx
[03:20] <Toma-> :>
[03:20] <KHatfull> nevermind about my nVidia question, I found the envy script...cool
[03:20] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: sorry, try   cat /etc/issue.net
[03:20] <LGKeiz> Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
[03:20] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: well, does nm-applet show anything?
[03:21] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: k, that's a.k.a. "Dapper"
[03:21] <LGKeiz> ah :o
[03:21] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: network-manager and network-manager-gnome aren't installed by default, you need to snag the packages and get them on that laptop
[03:21] <Toma-> how do you get spell checking in abiword?
[03:21] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Just says "No network devices".. and now it's unresponsive. :S
[03:21] <sidewalk`> im having problems running some applications
[03:22] <sidewalk`> they say for example
[03:22] <del4> it is flooding, im being evacuated, and all i can do is watch the "george bush don't like black ppl" clip. fits at least.
[03:22] <sidewalk`> unsupported locale setting
[03:22] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: hmm when you used it before, did you setup gnome keyring?
[03:22] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: eek urls to both, so I can burn them, and they're what I need right? Becasue I only have 1 CD left lol
[03:22] <sidewalk`> what is that about how do i solve it?
[03:22] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: On edgy eft, no?
[03:22] <sbarn> hello, I would like to setup an nfs server for my server to share my files (I did have samba server but am going to use linux for now on). I did an apt-get install nfs-user-server but where are the config files and such?
[03:22] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: ah, k, hmm try restarting it
[03:22] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: I initially tried to make it work with WPA, but that was on dapper. But now I said eff it and no security at all.
[03:22] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: can't you hardwire it temporarily?
[03:22] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: One minute. (PS: Thanks a lot for the help.)
[03:23] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: could lan it on this pc but..
[03:23] <LGKeiz> will that work
[03:23] <Sgeo> What is libnautilus-burn3, and why does vmware-player want to remove it?
[03:23] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if you connect it to hardwire you should be able to get it online so you can just do  apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome
[03:24] <ReWT_AxS> hey I installed fluxbox and am using that but my plug and play isnt working...which is it that i have to use to use plug and play
[03:24] <Sgeo> (If you respond, please mention "Sgeo")
[03:24] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you may need to go into Administration/Networking to tell it to dhcp for your connection
[03:24] <ReWT_AxS> i have to use gnome-keyboard-properties to make my volume buttons owrk
=== foomonkey is now known as foomonkey_away
[03:25] <LGKeiz> lets see what I can do..
[03:25] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: would be a waste of a CD for two tiny utilities like that
[03:25] <pmj> again, I can't boot an installation of Ubuntu. I have as best gotten to a grub error, error 21 which means disk not found. Is this a problem with grub or my BIOS settings? The menu.lst file looks fine, but I don't think grub even gets so far as to read it. Any ideas?
[03:25] <Toma-> ReWT_AxS: fluxbox isnt a whole desktop environment like gnome. you wont get anything like that unless you start alot of gnome processes with fluxbox
[03:25] <LGKeiz> win
[03:25] <LGKeiz> lan works
[03:25] <LGKeiz> okay, now what do I do
[03:26] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: o.k. first do this   'sudo apt-get update'  give your password
[03:26] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: gets your packages lists up to date
[03:26] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Yeah, it says "No network connection" when I mouseover.
[03:26] <ReWT_AxS> err it was working earlier
[03:26] <ReWT_AxS> just dunno which one i used
[03:27] <linux01> does anyone know how to get a sd media card reader on toshiba laptop to work with edgy?
[03:27] <dvdogrila> just finished installing ubuntu on reboot i get monitor out of range
[03:27] <lucas9000> hi all i'm a rank beginner...anyone willing to help me out with a question?
[03:27] <LGKeiz> done
[03:27] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: what now
[03:27] <Kingsqueak> dvdogrila: try  ctrl-alt-+/- on numpad
[03:27] <Toma-> dvdogrila: move your monitor closer to your computer XD
[03:27] <ReWT_AxS> so
[03:27] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: 'sudo apt-get install network-manager gnome-network-manager'
[03:27] <Toma-> dvdogrila: also, try the !fixres tag
[03:28] <Toma-> !fixres
[03:28] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[03:28] <ReWT_AxS> nvm got it
[03:28] <dvdogrila> kingsqueak on boot up?
[03:28] <Kingsqueak> dvdogrila: once it's all done
[03:28] <Yourname> I just rebooted Kingsqueak.. and it says "No network found"
[03:28] <Kingsqueak> dvdogrila: that toggles screen resolutions, sometimes it will start in one that is invalid, and you get lucky by toggling them to one that works
[03:29] <LGKeiz> sudo apt-get install network-manager gnome-network-manager
[03:29] <del4> lucas, just ask maybe someone can help. i'm on day 2 so probably not me. ;)
[03:29] <LGKeiz> do I do it like that
[03:29] <LGKeiz> or sudo apt-get install network-manager
[03:29] <lucas9000> thanks del
[03:29] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: all one line
[03:29] <LGKeiz> and sudo apt-get install gnome-network-manager
[03:29] <LGKeiz> it saids
[03:29] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: will do both at once
[03:29] <LGKeiz> Couldn't find p[ackage gnome-network-manager
[03:29] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: may be network-manager-gnome
[03:29] <LGKeiz> package *
[03:29] <lucas9000> i created a folder on my desktop just as a test (nothign in it) and now i can't get rid of it

[03:30] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: o.k. have you done anything else for setting up wifi, installed any other packages?
[03:30] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Linux-wlan-ng
[03:30] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: thanks for helping me :)
[03:30] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: as in wifi-radar or other packages?
[03:30] <Toma-> how do you get spell checking in abiword?
[03:30] <LGKeiz> It's setting up

[03:30] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Shit, yes.. last night. Wifi-radar, or I tried to.. just don't remember if I did or not.
[03:30] <lucas9000> del: while elegant in its simplicity, that didn't work :)
[03:30] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: what now
[03:30] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: o.k. apt-get remove that
[03:30] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: o.k. you are in GNOME now right?

[03:31] <LGKeiz> yep
[03:31] <dvdogrila> kingsqueak that did nothing
[03:31] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Even linux-wlan-ng? (It says wifi-radar not installed)
[03:31] <LGKeiz> I was doing this from terminal
[03:31] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: in a terminal, type   nm-applet
[03:31] <suckamc> damn grub broke my XP. it use to boot into XP until I installed grub. now all I get is error 18
[03:31] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I'm not sure what that other one is
[03:31] <LGKeiz> ok
[03:31] <LGKeiz> does this take awhile
[03:31] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: network-manager will fight with a few other things
[03:31] <LGKeiz> it's blank
[03:32] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Shit, so sorry.. I just don't remember.. I tried almost everything last night. :S
[03:32] <LGKeiz> It isn't doing anything, Lol just blank
[03:32] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: nope, you should now see a little double monitor looking icon in the top right taskbar

[03:34] <hanasaki> how do i setup squid to allow http for irc?  i have it setup to allow ports 6667-6669 but get a proxy traversal failed
[03:34] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you may want to reboot actually
[03:34] <Yourname> kingace: I got auto lo, and iface wlan0 inet dhcp, wireless-essid, and wireless_mode, and auto.
[03:34] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: just click the red circle at top right and tell it to restart
[03:35] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: aha, you got something else running and interfering
[03:35] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I'm not sure what though...try this
[03:35] <LGKeiz> yep
[03:35] <LGKeiz> the icon is there

[03:35] <LGKeiz> sec
[03:35] <LGKeiz> let me restart then
[03:35] <plugwash> hanasaki you need to allow http connect to those ports
[03:35] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: for all the lines except 'auto lo'  put a '#' in front of all of the rest
[03:35] <plugwash> i dunno how you do that in squid though
[03:35] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: commenting all.

[03:36] <b0ss_> need help how to install mplayer
[03:36] <del4> lucas, maybe try this: system -> administration -> users and groups -> select self -> properties button -> user privelliges tab -> enable "execute system admin tasks".. of course i am completely guessing. :D but if you can't get there, you will need to get admin somehow
[03:36] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: I got iface lo and auto lo on, and everything else commented and exited..
[03:36] <b0ss_> need help how to install mplayer  gladly appreciate it guys <3
[03:36] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: cool, try rebooting and see if network-manager works then
[03:37] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: One min, thanks.
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: this is not the machine you are chatting on right?
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> I'd guess not
[03:37] <Yourname> Kingsqueak, lol nopr.
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> k
[03:37] <Yourname> haha
[03:37] <lucas9000> del: i went there and i already have all permissions
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> what you did was disable all automatic network setup on boot
[03:37] <b0ss_> need help how to install mplayer  gladly appreciate it guys <3
[03:37] <Yourname> Gotcha.
[03:37] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: network-manager likes to do it all once it's running basically
[03:37] <Yourname> I did that a couple times too, lol
[03:37] <LGKeiz> Kingsquak: okay Im back in GNOME
[03:37] <Yourname> Aaah.
[03:38] <Loof> Anyone know if there is a target for iSCSI or AOE that can share out a DVD burner?
[03:38] <LGKeiz> Icon is there
[03:38] <LGKeiz> I click it
[03:38] <LGKeiz> Wired network still
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: what other options are there
[03:38] <Shadow_mil> How can I install some microsoft fonts?
[03:38] <LGKeiz> nothing else
[03:38] <LGKeiz> but Wired Network
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: enable wireless or show wireless networks, something like that
[03:38] <del4> lucas, hmm.. i wonder how that happened.. you're not accessing the folder are you? it's closed n nothing in it right?
[03:38] <LGKeiz> Kingsquak: nope
[03:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: maybe you have to right click it
[03:38] <lucas9000> del: right
[03:38] <lucas9000> it's just sitting there mocking me
[03:38] <LGKeiz> It saids Enable Networking connection information about and remove
[03:38] <agoole> Evening all, I'm having problems with my xorg.conf, When I boot normally I don't see text,. but if i boot into console and type startx then everything is fine, does startx use something different then when i normally boot ?
[03:38] <LGKeiz> thats what I do when I right click it
[03:39] <LGKeiz> It saids *
[03:39] <b0ss_> starx
[03:39] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: have you done any other fiddling to enable wireless up until now?  Installing anything else?
[03:40] <Yourname> haha, same deal eh.
[03:40] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: I went to system administration/Networking and tried to enable my Wireless thingy
[03:40] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: yeah maybe
[03:40] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you know how to edit files yet?
[03:40] <Hatty> I am experiencing a serious lagforce when trying to access the internet in Ubuntu (edgy). I open up firefox on the comp in the other room and its like instant. takes like 30s-1m to load a page, sometimes longer. Its getting really annoying.
[03:40] <LGKeiz> rifk nio
[03:40] <LGKeiz> rofl no *
[03:41] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Ok, up and running. No wireless yet.
[03:41] <del4> lucas9000 - try closing your eyes and opening them really fast and maybe it will be gone! ;P if you have access to admin tasks why couldn't you delete the folder? odd. good luck. :)
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: heh fun, well in a terminal do this  'sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces'
[03:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you'll have to tell me what you see there
[03:41] <bordy> So, I am having trouble with Flock and Firefox closing almost right after I opened them... someone told me to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but it didnt work. any tips?
[03:41] <lucas9000> del: i figured it out
[03:41] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Ok, wait.. I need to install my drivers using ndiswrapper, sec.
[03:42] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: k
[03:42] <linux01> does anyone know how to get a sd media card reader on toshiba laptop to work with edgy?
[03:42] <lucas9000> had to go into terminal then sudo rmdir [folder name] 
[03:42] <LGKeiz> I see
[03:42] <Yourname> (I had uninstalled them a second ago, just incase)
[03:42] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: looking for sections with 'lo' 'eth0' 'eth1' SSID etc
[03:43] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Ok, installed. The LEDs on the usb dongle don't light up though.
[03:43] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: see how there is a section for 'lo' two lines?
[03:43] <LGKeiz> auto lo iface lo inet lookback iface eth0 inet dhcp iface eth1 inet dhcp wireless-eeid alien wireless-key 6183261832 auto eth2 iface eth2 inet dhcp auto ath0 iface ath0 inet ahcp auto wlan0 iface wlan0 inet dhcp  auth eth1 auth eth0
[03:43] <lucas9000> del: thanks for the help anyway :)
[03:43] <del4> lucas - good you got it done. :) still a mystery though why you had to?
[03:43] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Do I need to ifup it?
[03:43] <lucas9000> del: yeah i'm not sure...oh well
[03:43] <LGKeiz> yeah
[03:43] <lucas9000> 'night all
[03:43] <lucas9000> later del
[03:43] <del4> nite
[03:43] <LGKeiz> It saids auto lo <down a line> i face lo inet loopback
[03:44] <LGKeiz> iface *
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: heh well, here's what you need to do, you need to comment out all those lines except for the auto lo and iface lo lines, you do that by putting a '#' in front of the rest, then save that file
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: you shouldn't
[03:44] <agoole> Evening all, I'm having problems with my xorg.conf, When I boot normally I don't see text,. but if i boot into console and type startx then everything is fine, does startx use something different then when i normally boot ?
[03:44] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Ok, waiting for instructions.
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: maybe restart network-manager now
[03:44] <Yourname> ok
[03:44] <hanasaki> how do i setup my default local for my system to the USA?
[03:44] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I don't know usb wireless though, I only know the built-in ones, there may be a kernel module that has to load
[03:44] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Ok, lol.. sorry, lost. How do I do it?
[03:45] <LGKeiz> done
[03:45] <LGKeiz> now waht
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: maybe right click it and quit, then start nm-applet manually in a terminal
[03:45] <RogerBacon> guy's, my first kernel panic, im happy :)
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: o.k., save the file and exit, and reboot
[03:45] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: No exit button on the app.
[03:45] <LGKeiz> restarting
[03:45] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you won't have ethernet when you come back on it though, just so you know
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: we'll fix that later
[03:46] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Shall I killall network-manager?
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: try nm-applet
[03:46] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: killall nm-applet
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> "killall" gives me the willies....working on Solaris all day
[03:47] <Yourname> haha
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> kids, don't type killall in Solaris....it kills _all_
[03:47] <LGKeiz> ok
[03:47] <Hatty> I am experiencing a serious lagforce when trying to access the internet in Ubuntu (edgy). I open up firefox on the comp in the other room and its like instant. takes like 30s-1m to load a page, sometimes longer. Its getting really annoying.
[03:47] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: nm-applet opens a new one.. just doesn't work.
[03:47] <LGKeiz> Back on
[03:47] <LGKeiz> Now it saids
[03:47] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: well it restarted, so stil nothing, no option to enable wireless or look for networks?
[03:47] <LGKeiz> create ne wireless connection
[03:47] <hillapple>  I'm kernel newbie , I wanna to compile linux kernel 0.0.1 ,but I come across some problem,one is that I can't find 'gas' and 'gld' ````and can some one give me a direction how to compile it and make it to a image?
[03:47] <LGKeiz> etc
[03:48] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: nope, shall I go into networking and see what I can get?
[03:48] <LGKeiz> want me to click, create new wireless connection Kingsqueak?
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: in network-manager, yeah, try that
[03:48] <LGKeiz> ok
[03:48] <LGKeiz> Network name
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: not sure now, I'm sort of out of guesses
[03:48] <LGKeiz> Wireless Security
[03:48] <LGKeiz> Network name would be the name of the network right
[03:48] <LGKeiz> like
[03:48] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: oh, haha, nice, there isn't any wlan0 in networking.
[03:48] <LGKeiz> "alien" is the name I use
[03:48] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: good, you just need to set it to use your network settings
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: yes, but it didn't just see it when you clicked on it?
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: exit that configuration window
[03:49] <LGKeiz> huh
[03:49] <LGKeiz> no it doesn'ty
[03:49] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Whats that ifconfig command I use to make it scan for APs on term?
[03:49] <LGKeiz> it said network name
[03:49] <threeseas> hello
[03:49] <LGKeiz> and wireless security
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: left click on the applet, does it have a wireless networks section?
[03:49] <LGKeiz> oh
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: might be right click
[03:49] <deviated> hi! i might have a little questing for my nvidia card i installed nvidia-glx since it seemed to be prety recent... but what about the nforce chipset... should i install it or ubuntu automaticly installed them since sound and network seems to work well
[03:49] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: do you have hidden ESSID setup on your router?
[03:50] <LGKeiz> I don't know.
[03:50] <LGKeiz> I can't click Wireless network
[03:50] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you're sure your router is on right?
[03:50] <Clinton__> does anyone have an install guide for ie6 on ubuntu?  (google is failing on good results)
[03:50] <LGKeiz> but I can click connect to other wireless network and Create new wireless network
[03:50] <LGKeiz> But not Wireless network
[03:50] <LGKeiz> Yeah...
[03:50] <LGKeiz> Im on it right now
[03:51] <threeseas> one of the things I have found out about ubuntu is that some things have been made so easy that in looking for how to do something, being used to some level of complexity in linux......I don't see it untill I have been angry about not being able to do it...
[03:51] <kriscolt> does anyone here have any experience with kismet that might be able to help me out?
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: try connect to other wireless network
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: what's that do, does it drop a list with your network on it?
[03:51] <LGKeiz> Now it saids input network name and  Wireless security
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> k
[03:51] <del4> clinton, if i may ask why in the world would you install ie6 on ubuntu? testing websites?
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: well, do that
[03:51] <Yourname> del4, lolol
[03:51] <LGKeiz> 6183261832 = what Wireless security type
[03:51] <Clinton__> del4: exactly
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: it's case sensitive for the ID, so be sure it's 'alien' and not Alien or ALIEN
[03:51] <threeseas> CD recording and now mounting a remote systems drives
[03:51] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: is that your passphrase?
[03:52] <Austin_> what is bash scripting
[03:52] <del4> clinton, i think there are websites that will emulate browser renderingi'm gonna take a quick look cuz i could use the same utility
[03:52] <threeseas> I don't need K3b or sshfs
[03:52] <LGKeiz> yeah when I configured the router, I put it 6183261832, it didn't automatically give me it
[03:52] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: try WPA2
[03:52] <Kingsqueak> maybe WPA
[03:52] <LGKeiz> enterprise or personal
[03:52] <Kingsqueak> personal
[03:52] <Yourname> Right.
[03:52] <Clinton__> del4: I've done it before about a year ago, but now all the guides seem out of date.  It is possible
[03:52] <Yourname> Like that's gonna work.
[03:52] <Yourname> My friend, I've given up trying to get WPA to work.
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: it works, I use it for work
[03:53] <Yourname> That shtupid wpa_supplicant and all that jazz, damn, lol
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: network-manager does it for you ;-)
[03:53] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: That's why you're the KING squeak ;)
[03:53] <LGKeiz> Attempting to join the wireless network alien
[03:53] <judgen> hi. anything new
[03:53] <judgen> ?
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you are so very close if it fails, you just need to figure out settings for logging in now
[03:53] <judgen> Is there a ubuntu distro with solaris as kernel?
[03:53] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: i.e. linux is setup
[03:54] <khermans> judgen, you are thinking of Nexenta
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if you want to go back to wired, just plug in and network-manager should set it up, if not click it to set it up
[03:54] <LGKeiz> kingsqueak: it keeps attempting
[03:54] <LGKeiz> oh
[03:54] <LGKeiz> No Network connection
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you might need to try WPA and not WPA2
[03:54] <LGKeiz> so it must be WPA
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: possibly
[03:54] <LGKeiz> how do I editit
[03:54] <jake> hi
[03:54] <jake> whats up
[03:54] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: what are you on now a windows box?
[03:55] <LGKeiz> the alien connection
[03:55] <Austin_> what is bash and scripting
[03:55] <jared> hey how do i get second life going?
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: right click on it I think
[03:55] <apokryphos> !bash
[03:55] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via applications -> accessories -> terminal (gnome) or kmenu -> system -> konsole (kde). Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[03:55] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: Im connected directly to the modem with wireless due to I host things which require DMZ and my router likes to bitch with DMZ..
[03:55] <jared> i am a noob i am getting pwned by linux
[03:55] <judgen> khermans well, not really. Nexenta didnt have the KDE desktop fully supported. And i cant stand metacity. (and all people that use gnome know the hassle of changing)
[03:55] <LGKeiz> for some reason
[03:55] <w30> Clinton__, check out http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
[03:55] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: in what, Windows?
[03:55] <LGKeiz> Yeah
[03:55] <khermans> judgen, if it is such a hassle, build your onwn dirsto from source
[03:55] <LGKeiz> It's not letting me edit alien
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: open the connection properties thing for windows and see what it tells you
[03:56] <LGKeiz> WPA
[03:56] <jared> !freeformats
[03:56] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: k
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: is there an option in network-manager for setup another network?  Try that
[03:56] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: or maybe double click on alien
[03:56] <judgen> khermans did that, but my comp power does not compile all my apps in the speed needed for me to use them in a reasonable matter. Concidering all the updates
[03:56] <jared> itunes on linux is that possible?
[03:56] <LGKeiz> WPA Personal right
[03:56] <furraymurray> i dont think so
[03:57] <judgen> only have 2x opteron 275
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: there's a way to get alien open again I just don't have my laptop with me
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: yes
[03:57] <del4> clinton, http://www.hashemian.com/tools/browser-simulator.htm i dunno if that helps you at all. it doesn't replicate an error on a website i've seen in ie though, when i set it for the settings my ie @ work is on.
[03:57] <judgen> jared yes
[03:57] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: that code is your passphrase of course
[03:57] <Triplemeh> Is there any way I can change the font color of the text on the desktop and the GNOME panel
[03:57] <Triplemeh> ?
[03:57] <LGKeiz> Preparing device eth1 for the wireless network "alien"
[03:57] <furraymurray> I have a question regarding read-only textfiles/lists
[03:57] <judgen> jared works perfectly afaik on most itunes, but drag and drop mut be a little worked on
[03:57] <furraymurray> how do i edit them?
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if it works, it will change from a two-monitor looking thing into a signal bar strength meter
[03:58] <jrib> ubotu: tell furraymurray about sudo
[03:58] <judgen> haha
[03:58] <Triplemeh> murray
[03:58] <furraymurray> well yeah i know about sudo
[03:58] <jrib> furraymurray: what files exactly?
[03:58] <furraymurray> ha
[03:58] <judgen> tell about sudo.... sorry, im a little drunk
[03:58] <Triplemeh> sudo won't work?
[03:58] <LGKeiz> King it didn't work
[03:58] <LGKeiz> got the little caution sign thingy
[03:58] <furraymurray> i dont know how to edit a readonly file under sudo
[03:58] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: it's your settings somewhere, not sure what exactly
[03:59] <Triplemeh> what kind of readonly file is it?
[03:59] <Triplemeh> oh wait, text
[03:59] <furraymurray> .lst
[03:59] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: keep messing around with the settings in that applet
[03:59] <Triplemeh> is the file on an ntfs file system?
[03:59] <jrib> furraymurray: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst   (I'm assuming that's the file you are talking about)
[03:59] <furraymurray> yeah yeah
[03:59] <judgen> furraymurray "sudo nano /%directorname%/%filename%
[03:59] <furraymurray> wow jrib just read my mind
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I'm not sure where yer at because of the driver issue, not sure what to tell you from here but it should work similar to LGKeiz if your driver loads up right
[04:00] <Triplemeh> I've edited menu.lst many times by just sudo gedit menu.lst
[04:00] <Hatty> i am experiencing heavy lag when trying to view webpages, though i can nslookup or ping the hosts instantly. the internet is working fine on my windows box in the other room (Router->Linksys Workgroup Switch->UbuntuBox & WindowsBox). I am using Edgy
[04:00] <jrib> furraymurray: use gksudo with gui apps, sudo with normal command line apps.  That command just says "Hey, run my editor with super user privileges"
[04:00] <Kingsqueak> Hatty: in Firefox?
[04:00] <Triplemeh> Hatty, are you using firefox?
[04:00] <furraymurray> ok thanks
[04:00] <Hatty> Kingsqueak: Triplemeh: in both firefox AND elinks
[04:00] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: haha, it's all good man, you atleast tried. I just uninstalled my network manager, and linux-wlan-ng is still there.. but the funny thing is I have wlan0 showing up in networking.
[04:01] <judgen> Anyone here use Vi? What is the advantages over nano? Except being faster to spell?
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> Hatty: try disabling ipv6, go into about:config and search on 'v6' double click that to disable it
[04:01] <Hatty> judgen: syntax hilighting
[04:01] <LGKeiz> ooh
[04:01] <LGKeiz> IT's WEP
[04:01] <LGKeiz> lol
[04:01] <mzli> <judgen>Use what you like.
[04:01] <Triplemeh> you have to disable IPv6, enable network pipelining, and increase the amount of pipelining max requests
[04:01] <LGKeiz> attempting to join
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: you have something interfering I think
[04:01] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: that wlan-ng, try uninstalling it and rebooting
[04:01] <bimberi> !ipb6
[04:01] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: That
[04:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ipb6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:01] <bimberi> !ipv6
[04:01] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[04:02] <Hatty> thanks
[04:02] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: That would mean I have no wlan-ng, or network-manager.. and just ndiswrapper.
[04:02] <Triplemeh> sudo, can anyone answer my gnome-panel question?
[04:02] <Triplemeh> I mean, so* lol sudo
[04:02] <Hatty> heh
[04:02] <judgen> mzli i have used pico since one of the first pine releases, so i have kinda hard time to reacclimatize to something new. As VI does not seems as fast for me.
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: not sure, have you checked the wiki yet for USB wireless config?
[04:02] <jirwin> hey there. I am having a problem with Edgy(I saw the same problem in Dapper as well), but randomly all of my usb ports will die, and then no usb devices will work. I have to restart to get the working. Any ideas on what could be causeing this?
[04:02] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Yes sir, lol.
[04:02] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: ahh it's WEP 64bit too I think with a passphrase that short
[04:03] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Let me try getting wlan-ng out of the way.
[04:03] <furraymurray> hey i updated my os to 6.10, does anyone know if i need all these extra kernels in the boot/grub/menu.lst file
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: with ndis I really don't know as I haven't set that up yet
[04:03] <LGKeiz> hex or ASCII
[04:03] <judgen> jirwin probably to few mountponts created, but i dont know
[04:03] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: ASCII I think as it's so short and no letter in it
[04:03] <jirwin> judgen: what do you mean?
[04:03] <mzli> <judgen> no need to compare it . It's all best. but you are not all familiar with those. Just Use what you familiar.
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: HEX would be loooong and have c4f2d4 etc
[04:04] <LGKeiz> nope
[04:04] <LGKeiz> it has to be 128-bit
[04:04] <Hatty> Triplemeh: So how do I enable network pipelining & increase amount of pipelining max requests?
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: are you in 128 or 64bit web?
[04:04] <LGKeiz> I can't click connect
[04:04] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: no idea rofl
[04:04] <jirwin> dmesg doesn't show anything after they seem to die either.
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: it may be hex for 64
[04:04] <jirwin> is there a way to just restart the bus?
[04:04] <Austin_> what is bash and scripting
[04:04] <judgen> jirwin you can create mountpoints to all sda devices available in /media, then add them to fstab then they migt work. For me its 100%
[04:04] <furraymurray> thanks everyone
[04:04] <w30> furraymurray, no you don't need them. Use Synaptic, select the kernels you don't want and uninstall them and they will be gone (in the menu as well).
[04:04] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: there should be a choice for it maybe, if not just select HEX this time
[04:04] <Triplemeh> Hatty: in about:config
[04:05] <Triplemeh> in firefox
[04:05] <jirwin> judgen: I don't think I should be mounting my usb mouse
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: your windows machine doesn't show you that config?
[04:05] <Hatty> Triplemeh: ah k
[04:05] <Triplemeh> in the filter enter "pipelining"
[04:05] <judgen> Austin_ Bash= Bourne,Again,Shell=standard Posix shell
[04:05] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: It probably does but I don't know where or what you're talking about.
[04:05] <madelephant> is anyone familiar with connecting to ad-hoc connections? i'm having a little trouble
[04:05] <david_> hello everyone--a few days ago, my i810-based laptop's graphics started acting up.  Now, windows don't repaint properly to the point where it's unusable.  I'm running edgy
[04:05] <Triplemeh> set the option to "true" and the max requests to around 30 or so
[04:05] <Hatty> Triplemeh: thanks
[04:05] <linux01> does anyone know how to get a sd media card reader on toshiba laptop to work with edgy?
[04:05] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: heh somewhere in your 'connection manager' in windows, usually a tray icon you can see the properties for the connection
[04:05] <Hatty> reboot time
[04:06] <judgen> jirwin does your usb mouse not work in X11?
[04:06] <jirwin> no...it works perfectly until the usb ports die
[04:06] <LGKeiz> YUeah.
[04:06] <Kingsqueak> linux01: should 'just work' on boot
[04:06] <judgen> jirwin is it the 11min error of apm or random?
[04:06] <linux01> yea thats what i figure but it doesn't
[04:06] <LGKeiz> Urgh
[04:06] <Kingsqueak> linux01: look at 'dmesg | less' and see if you see it identified as an 'sd' device somewhere
[04:06] <LGKeiz> blah
[04:06] <LGKeiz> It's still not connecting
[04:07] <jirwin> judgen: seemingly random. I have had it worked for hours
[04:07] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: well you're mere connection settings away from it working
[04:07] <jirwin> other times it dies before I log in
[04:07] <judgen> to make sure, install the acpi addons and the apm fomr synaptiic (powermanagement related)
[04:07] <judgen> sorry for my bad spellng
[04:08] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: the only thing I could tell you now is go through your router configuration again and set it up and make notes
[04:08] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: but heh, you might knock yourself out entirely doing that
[04:08] <madelephant> Looking for some help with connecting to an ad-hoc connection... i can assosciate (iwconfig eth1 mode Ad-Hoc essid xxxx) but can't pull an ip address
[04:08] <LGKeiz> lol
[04:08] <judgen> i have to smoke, if you need to talk to me. Write to me in #empty
[04:09] <tag> the new evolution is so annoying
[04:09] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: maybe I gotta set it so it sends a stronger signal?
[04:09] <Hatty> !ip6
[04:09] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ip6 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:09] <Hatty> !ipv6
[04:09] <LGKeiz> Because like.. My router is pretty damn far away
[04:09] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[04:09] <LGKeiz> lol
[04:09] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: nah
[04:09] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: can you get closer to it to try your laptop setup?
[04:09] <LGKeiz> isnt there something to show a list of networks
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: actually network-manager should if it sees it
[04:10] <LGKeiz> weird o___o
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: so yeah, maybe try getting closer to it
[04:10] <LGKeiz> It's not..
[04:10] <Hatty> I followed the instructions there, but it didnt disable IPv6 -.-
[04:10] <LGKeiz> I had windows on this laptop before and it was able to see the networks just fine
[04:10] <Hatty> Firefox runs super fast now though
[04:10] <LGKeiz> but it's not showing lol
[04:10] <babo> so if I do a  select * from table1 left join table2 ON table1.key == table2.col ... and I want to do another RIGHT JOIN on that table ... what do I call the conjoined table ?
[04:10] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if you get closer, maybe it will see it, how far is far?
[04:11] <babo> RIGHT JOIN ON table1?/table2?
[04:11] <Pelo> evening folks
[04:11] <LGKeiz> 5 rooms down
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> super far is 50 feet or behind metal doors etc.
[04:11] <LGKeiz> Like I said
[04:11] <LGKeiz> it worked fine with windows
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> take your laptop down there
[04:11] <linux01> Kingsqueak: dmesg | less doesn't show anything about sd device
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> just try it
[04:11] <LGKeiz> ok lol
[04:11] <Kingsqueak> linux01: hmm
[04:11] <sagarp> suddenly, files dont open with the default program any more...also in nautilus, movie/music/launcher icons show up as text icons...how can i fix this?
[04:12] <bruenig> sagarp, right clicking on a file and then clicking properties will allow you to set the application it opens with
[04:12] <sonnie> can i ask a vsftpd on ubuntu question?
[04:12] <bruenig> !ask
[04:12] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:12] <judgen> sonnie have you cheked the man pages?
[04:13] <sagarp> bruenig, they should never have been unset...for example on my desktop, instead of firefox, it shows an icon called "*.desktop"
[04:13] <sonnie> yes, i gooooooooogled a lot, but failed to solve the problems
[04:13] <madelephant> Anyone know how to connect to an ad-hoc connection? I can assosciate but can't get an ip
[04:13] <Kingsqueak> linux01: you see any 'usb-storage' devices listed?
[04:13] <sonnie> this is about per-user configuration
[04:13] <Pelo> sagarp,  right click on the file,  go to properties,  open with  and specify the right app again,  not sure about the icon
[04:13] <judgen> sonnie what seems to be the problem?
[04:13] <Hatty> i added "alias net-pf-10 off" to /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list but ipv6 is still enabled. =/
[04:13] <bruenig> sagarp, I have no idea why  the were unset or whether they should have been. I was only telling you how to set them back.
[04:13] <sonnie> i have set user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd_user_conf in vsftpd.conf
[04:13] <BIRD> Does anyone know any good ftp sites that I can access via CLI that do not require a password and are anonymous?
[04:13] <babo> right thanks ...
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> linux01: I have things like -> "Vendor: Generic   Model: USB SD Reader" in my logs
[04:14] <judgen> BIRD yes, but what do you want?
[04:14] <sonnie> but options in /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/blah seem not usable.
[04:14] <Triplemeh> Hatty, this guide helped me out a great deal http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/08/02/local-dns-cache-for-faster-browsing/
[04:14] <VapourIFH> Sure.. ftp.ubuntu.com
[04:14] <LGKeiz> King, weird..
[04:14] <LGKeiz> I just went right next to the router room
[04:14] <Pelo> BIRD,  look at the channel name and topic
[04:14] <LGKeiz> and it didn't pick up anything
[04:14] <LGKeiz> O_o;
[04:14] <BIRD> judjen I am looking for mp3s, videos, and games
[04:14] <LGKeiz> meaning it's telling me there is no networks
[04:14] <sagarp> bruenig, Pelo: so what program should i set to open launcher files with?
[04:14] <LGKeiz> lol
[04:14] <madelephant> lookin for help connecting to an ad-hoc connection
[04:14] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: try a reboot right there, to be sure network-manager resets
[04:14] <Triplemeh> but I didn't RECOMMEND it!
[04:14] <bruenig> sagarp, you probably ought to redo those. Some deleting and dragging and dropping ought to do
[04:15] <GaiaX11> why is that when someone has kubuntu and ubuntu in the boot time the kubuntu interface takes over the ubuntu interface?
[04:15] <sonnie> virtual users can login and chrooted
[04:15] <VapourIFH> bird.. sounds like you are in the wrong channel here.
[04:15] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: also do you see anything if you do   dmesg | grep ipw
[04:15] <Pelo> sagarp,  oh, you are talking about launchers ?  , just point them to the right prog then
[04:15] <judgen> BIRD maybe no the rght channel, we are opensource. I can direct you to some opensource songs and videos, but i dont think you like that
[04:15] <BIRD> What channel talks about ftp?
[04:15] <Hatty> Triplemeh: its not that. I just want to totally get ipv6 disabled since i dont need it
[04:15] <bruenig> he said launchers and filetypes I believe
[04:15] <BIRD> I would im looking for open source software
[04:15] <Pelo> sagarp,  launchers are just like  making a shortcut to a .exe file in windows,  just point it to the prog
[04:15] <Triplemeh> know what, I would like to do so as well
[04:16] <BIRD> Im looking for a ftp site that hosts open source ubuntu/linux software
[04:16] <sonnie> echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/accept_ra
[04:16] <judgen> BIRD have you looked into the multiverse and universe repos, there is LOADS of good stuff there
[04:16] <Pelo> BIRD,  for ubuntu stuff just use  synaptic
[04:16] <sonnie> Hatty: echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/accept_ra
[04:16] <BIRD> k thnx
[04:17] <madelephant> anyone good at using ad-hoc connections?
[04:17] <judgen> BIRD just remeber to ENABLE universe and multiverse
[04:17] <LGKeiz> kingsqueak no
[04:17] <LGKeiz> I just rebooted
[04:17] <LGKeiz> went by the room
[04:17] <Soldier1991> Hello.
[04:17] <LGKeiz> no workie
[04:17] <LGKeiz> no listings neither
[04:17] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: hrmm try  'dmesg | grep ipw'
[04:17] <LGKeiz> also.. it's cold out ;_;
[04:17] <sonnie> so no one can help me solve the vsftpd problem? :(
[04:17] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy and lost my SMP support :(
[04:17] <judgen> BIRD or you will only get 1k tested software
[04:17] <Jbirk> Hello
[04:17] <Jbirk> how long until edgy gets released?
[04:17] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: this is a Dell laptop right?
[04:17] <Kingsqueak> Jbirk: it's out
[04:17] <GerManson> Jbirk: edgy is out
[04:17] <LGKeiz> yep
[04:17] <Jbirk> How does it compare to Dapper?
[04:18] <LGKeiz> just done what you said
[04:18] <GerManson> Jbirk: new feats. gnome is the biggest i guess
[04:18] <Soldier1991> I need help with my ati radeon 9250, it seems like my graphics card isn't on the list of opensource drivers, the only thing I see that seems familiar is Radeon 9200PRO/9200/9200SE, M9+ and I don't think those drivers would work with my card, someone help me please?
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: what does   ifconfig -a  show you for interfaces?
[04:18] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy and lost my SMP support :(
[04:18] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: should have lo and eth0 and probably eth1
[04:18] <Soldier1991> I cannot go to the GUI either.
[04:18] <Soldier1991> Only the command line.
[04:18] <elementz> hi everybody
[04:18] <Soldier1991> Hi.
[04:18] <LGKeiz> eth0 eth1 lo sit0
[04:19] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy and lost my SMP support :(
[04:19] <elementz> can't get my audigy nx2 usb to run on edgy
[04:19] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: k, well it sees your wireless card, it's eth1
[04:19] <elementz> tried to google a solution to no avail - anybody?
[04:19] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: not sure on what else is wrong, maybe your router config itself has something odd with it, are you totally sure the ESSID is 'alien' and not Alien or ALIEN ?
[04:19] <Pelo> elementz,  have you tried the ubuntu forum ?
[04:19] <maxflax> GerManson : SMP?
[04:19] <Soldier1991> Can anyone help me please?
[04:19] <dasos> is there a simple package to install that has flex/bison/all the other normal gnu build software?
[04:20] <LGKeiz> yep
[04:20] <LGKeiz> and it should view..
[04:20] <Pelo> Soldier1991,  try the forum
[04:20] <GerManson> maxflax: Symmetric multiprocessing
[04:20] <Soldier1991> I did.
[04:20] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: yeah it should show you a list of networks, at least the one you have
[04:20] <Soldier1991> No type of solution to be found.
[04:20] <LGKeiz> you do know..
[04:20] <Jbirk> overall, can I upgrade from Ubuntu to Edgy without problems?
[04:20] <LGKeiz> in network-admin
[04:20] <VapourIFH> soldier1991, what device is listed in the xorg.conf file?
[04:20] <Jbirk> Daper -->> Edgy
[04:20] <Jbirk> ?
[04:20] <maxflax> GerManson, ok.. for duel core system or?
[04:20] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy and lost my SMP support :(
[04:20] <dvdogrila> ok this is crazy i got ubuntu working from the recovery mode, when i do startx im able to boot in the gui. but when i restart and select the normal option as soon at it starts i get out of range on my monitor
[04:20] <LGKeiz> Wireless Connection  the interface eth1 is not configured
[04:20] <GerManson> maxflax: dual core or HT
[04:21] <LGKeiz> In Network settings in network-admin
[04:21] <LGKeiz> >.>
[04:21] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: that should be fine though
[04:21] <GerManson> maxflax: HT = Hyper threading
[04:21] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: nm-applet takes over for that
[04:21] <LGKeiz> o_o
[04:21] <LGKeiz> Well
[04:21] <LGKeiz> It's not showing me a list of networks
[04:21] <dvdogrila> any sugguestions
[04:21] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: I'm out of guesses at this point
[04:21] <GaiaX11> GerManson: You are luckier than me because I upgraded to edgy and lost my whole system. Then I had to install all again and it has taken me lots of time. 4 days now. So I came back to dapper and now nearly everything is ok.
[04:21] <maxflax> GerManson, isn't that embedded in the kernel..
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> GerManson: you intel or AMD ?
[04:22] <GerManson> maxflax: supposed too, i've read about same problem and the only fix they found was.. new install.. using ISO.
[04:22] <LGKeiz> urgh
[04:22] <GerManson> kingace: i am on an Intel Pentium 4, 2.8 HT
[04:22] <sethk> maxflax, yes, it's part of the kernel.  there are several kernel images, though
[04:22] <LGKeiz> what the hell :(
[04:22] <sagarp> where do gnome/nautilus store information about file type associations and all that? is it in gconf somewhere?
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> GerManson: and you have the i686 kernel installed?
[04:22] <sethk> maxflax, there's a kernel image without smp and one with smp
[04:22] <GerManson> Kingsqueak: yep
[04:22] <LGKeiz> Why the hell isn't it showing networks ;__;
[04:22] <Kingsqueak> GerManson: cat /proc/cpuinfo  only shows one core?
[04:23] <sethk> maxflax, so you can upgrade, choose the wrong kernel (or the install program chooses the wrong kernel for you) and lose smp
[04:23] <Jbirk> what is the command to upgrade?
[04:23] <GaiaX11> GerManson: So, i had a bad experience with edgy. And I think that I will stick to dapper for a long time now.
[04:23] <GerManson> Kingsqueak: just one
[04:23] <Jbirk> what is the command to upgrade to edgy?
[04:23] <TehUni> is there anything fundamentally wrong with mounting a hard drive (my mp3 and xvid drive) in my home folder?
[04:23] <LGKeiz> ooo
[04:23] <linux01> kingsqueak: i looked through that list twice and i dont see anything about SD card reader
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> GerManson: you dual core or SMP?
[04:23] <LGKeiz> in network tools
[04:23] <LGKeiz> it saids
[04:23] <GerManson> GaiaX11: Edgy is good, that was the only problem i found
[04:23] <bruenig> !edgy
[04:23] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[04:23] <GerManson> Kingsqueak: SMP dude.
[04:23] <sethk> GaiaX11, I always wait several weeks after a new release.  For my production machines, I upgrade to the _previous_ version when a new version is released.
[04:23] <LGKeiz> eth0 but not eth1
[04:23] <maxflax> sethk, ok.. tell that to GerManson
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> GerManson: ah o.k., hmm not sure
[04:23] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: it saids eth0 and lo but not eth1
[04:23] <LGKeiz> In network tools
[04:23] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: the other network tools won't see it
[04:24] <GerManson> sethk: i wanted gnome 2.16 :( lol
[04:24] <sethk> maxflax, ok, I pointed it at you because you said, correctly, that it's embedded in the kernel.  I was just pointing out that, although it's embedded in the kernel, you can still screw it up.  :)
[04:24] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: you could try it, but only network-manager got it working for me
[04:24] <sethk> GerManson, you can upgrade gnome without upgrading the world.
[04:24] <GerManson> sethk: i know, but upgrading distro was the easiest way
[04:24] <LGKeiz> no no no Network Tools - Devices
[04:24] <LGKeiz> It doesn't show eth1
[04:24] <LGKeiz> o_o;
[04:24] <sethk> GerManson, unless it doesn't work, then it's not _quite_ so easy.  :)
[04:24] <Kingsqueak> linux01: I'm not sure, unless you need to load kernel mods for usb devices etc.
[04:24] <GerManson> sethk: lol, you are right.
[04:25] <GerManson> I didnt want to make a new install.. but i already see it coming.
[04:25] <maxflax> sethk, ok!!
[04:25] <linux01> haha little outta my league i think i'll just leave it alone for now
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if 'ifconfig' sees it, it's there, the other tools read config files and you commented out the configs before
[04:25] <Jbirk> Is Edgy stable?
[04:25] <linux01> thanks for the help though
[04:25] <Jbirk> and will it break my XGL?
[04:25] <sethk> GerManson, then stop resisting it, and just byte the bullet.
[04:25] <GerManson> sethk: tomorrow morning :)
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> linux01: try this   'sudo modprobe usb_storage'
[04:25] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak, then what the heck, lol I wonder why it's not looking / showing networks
[04:25] <Kingsqueak> linux01: give your password when it prompts you
[04:26] <sethk> Jbirk, it could, sure.  It's brand knew.  Odds are it won't, but you can't say absolutely not.
[04:26] <Kingsqueak> linux01: then  'tail /var/log/messages'  see if it babbles about a storage device
[04:26] <LGKeiz> ethernet works perfectly fine
[04:26] <LGKeiz> just wireless..
[04:26] <Kingsqueak> linux01: or type 'dmesg' again , see what it says at the end
[04:26] <GerManson> I upgraded to Edgy and lost my SMP support :(
[04:26] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: no idea, everything else 'looks' like it's right
[04:26] <sethk> LGKeiz, wireless is ethernet, at least in this case.  wireless extension to ieee ethernet standard.
[04:26] <Shadow_mil> GerManson: try a clean install of edgy
[04:26] <GerManson> should i get back to gentoo? xD
[04:26] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: I suspect your actual connection settings options for wireless now
[04:26] <sethk> GerManson, that's easily fixed, though
[04:27] <sethk> GerManson, just install the smp kernel
[04:27] <m4jqp> when i reboot my computer it doesnt show text ... but if i boot into console mode and type startx i can see text ... how do i make it so that when i reboot it's the same as typin gstartx ?
[04:27] <GerManson> Shadow_mil: if i dont find fix now, i will do that tomorrow morning
[04:27] <GerManson> sethk: there is no smp kernel now, they say its "emmbed" just in one.
[04:27] <GerManson> and it should work
[04:27] <linux01> im sorry if i didnt mention this but it is built in sd card reader not a usb external
[04:27] <GerManson> but for people that "updgrade" seems to be missing
[04:27] <Shadow_mil> sounds like to me your already given up ;)
[04:27] <sethk> GerManson, probably the same.  in any event, rebuilding the kernel is trivial
[04:27] <sethk> linux01, shouldn't make any difference
[04:27] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: o.o??
[04:27] <sethk> linux01, still sits on a PCI bus
[04:27] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: stupid question, but you didn't turn off the radio switch on the side of the laptop did you?
[04:27] <GerManson> sethk: rebuilding was my first choice but didnt work
[04:28] <sethk> GerManson, why not?  How did you try to do it?
[04:28] <Jbirk> Can I make an image of my hard drive
[04:28] <GerManson> reinstall package.
[04:28] <GerManson> 8-)
[04:28] <GerManson> am i a dumb?
[04:28] <Jbirk> then restore my entire install of linux?
[04:28] <sethk> GerManson, that's not rebuliding.
[04:28] <Jbirk> any ideas
[04:28] <Jbirk> how can I backup my entire EXT3 Dapper System?
[04:28] <Jbirk> Just incase Edgy leaves me high and dry
[04:28] <sethk> GerManson, you install the source, copy in the config, do make xconfig, enable smp, and build.
[04:28] <Kingsqueak> linux01: yeah it will still ID as usb
[04:28] <Jbirk> or low and wet :-)
[04:28] <GerManson> I miss my gentoo :( and feel total control
[04:28] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: I don't even think there is one..
[04:28] <mzli> <Jbirk>use dd
[04:28] <sethk> Jbirk, sure, you can, if you have enough space
[04:29] <sethk> GerManson, there is nothing you can do in gentoo that you can't do in ubuntu.
[04:29] <Jbirk> I have only about 5 GB in use
[04:29] <Jbirk> I am thinking about copying it to another drive
[04:29] <GerManson> sethk: i know seth..
[04:29] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: on the left side, it's a small spring loaded slide switch on the 820, it may be a Fn key switch on others
[04:29] <Jbirk> won't DD take forever?
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, that's the best thing to do
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, don't dd it
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, just tar it up
[04:29] <GerManson> sethk: but you get used to one way after some years
[04:29] <Jbirk> will it restore all the permissions?
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, that will indeed be much faster, and also you can compress it.
[04:29] <Jbirk> Any imaging software
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, yes, absolutely, you use a flag
[04:29] <Jbirk> NO need to compress
[04:29] <sethk> Jbirk, --preserve
[04:29] <Jbirk> only about 6 GB data
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: somewhere there should at least be a light to show it's on
[04:30] <sethk> Jbirk, ok, I said you can, not that you have to  :)
[04:30] <Jbirk> there is also CPIO, but I won't go there :)
[04:30] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: IT WORKED!
[04:30] <sethk> Jbirk, not really much difference between tar with --preserve and cpio
[04:30] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: cool man, what was the trick?
[04:30] <necrolud0> this might be sstupid question, but why does synaptic always try to download Translation_en_US from all the repositories?
[04:30] <LGKeiz> there is a light where the power light is where it shows if the wireless is on or not, but there is no switch, Lol..
=== Linuturk is now known as Linuturk_zZz
[04:31] <Jbirk> Here is what I have
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: o.k.....is it on?
[04:31] <sethk> Jbirk, you have to do the tar as root, even if non-root can read all the files, because of some internal details in tar.
[04:31] <Jbirk> I have /dev/hda1 on / type is ext3 and used is 4.7 GiB
[04:31] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: if not, try the function key that looks like an antenna and see if it lights up
[04:31] <Jbirk> So, backup space isn;t a problem
[04:31] <Jbirk> Can I copy my whole file system to a Windows computer on my network?
[04:31] <draco79> ok what do i need to install xchat
[04:31] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: One secnd, lol, roomie yelling..
[04:31] <sethk> Jbirk, tar does the best job, backing up things like /dev nodes
[04:32] <sethk> Jbirk, exclude the pseudo file systems (/proc and /sys)
[04:32] <Jbirk> I have to dismount it right?
[04:32] <sethk> Jbirk, no
[04:32] <david_> Recently, my computer's screen seems not to update except whatever is directly under the mouse and newly created windows.  What is causing this, and how can I fix it?
[04:32] <Jbirk> I can copy a mounted system?
[04:32] <sethk> Jbirk, in fact, you can't dismount it.
[04:32] <Lam_> what's the difference between azureus and azureus-gcj?
[04:32] <LGKeiz> kingsqueak: the light goes on when it searches for wireless networks or whatever
[04:32] <LGKeiz> and I just done it
[04:32] <Kingsqueak> just backup your data, screw the rest a reinstall is too easy to just do
[04:32] <LGKeiz> nothing changed
[04:32] <LGKeiz> lol..
[04:32] <Jbirk> I would think I would startup in single user mode
[04:32] <sethk> Jbirk, sure.  If you want to be extra careful, you can boot the livecd, and then mount it.
[04:32] <Jbirk> then umount /dev/hda1
[04:32] <sethk> Jbirk, single user mode is a good idea, yes,
[04:33] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: hmm you totally sure it's enabled in the BIOS?
[04:33] <Jbirk> I just don't want a messed up file system
[04:33] <Jbirk> I know Linux has tons of open files
[04:33] <sethk> Jbirk, but you can't umount it.  you can't access it unless it's mounted.  unless you want to image it with something like dd
[04:33] <Jbirk> Oh, I C
[04:33] <sethk> Jbirk, to be 100% safe, boot the live cd and mount the root drive somewhere
[04:33] <Jbirk> what about something like partimage?
[04:33] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: BIOS..? of course.. I didn't touch anything it worked when windows was on it
[04:33] <st4hl> does anyone know why dhcpd gives me "no subnet declaration for eth1(0.0.0.0)" ?
[04:33] <sethk> Jbirk, that's just dd
[04:33] <Jbirk> Oh, I C
[04:33] <LGKeiz> I loaded the live CD and than I went into it, install, it rebooted and then I talked to you
[04:33] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: o.k., well I'm back to the old theory, it's just your connection settings options
[04:34] <Jbirk> What about the Novell Zenworks 7 Image Engine?
[04:34] <m4jqp> when i reboot my computer it doesnt show text ... but if i boot into console mode and type startx i can see text ... how do i make it so that when i reboot it's the same as typin gstartx ?
[04:34] <bimberi> Lam_: one uses the nonfree java environment and the other (-gcj) uses the Gnu Java environment
[04:34] <sethk> st4hl, that's a configuration issue, in the dhcpd config file.
[04:34] <sethk> st4hl, let me look up how that subnet statement is used ...
[04:34] <st4hl> i understand, but what does it mean? thanks ;)
[04:34] <LGKeiz> But it should still show wireless networks, which it isn't..
[04:34] <Shadow_mil> st4hl: you need to give it s subnet mask, 255.255.255.0 is normally fine
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: unless you setup your router to hide the ESSID
[04:35] <linux01> [17184440.436000]  usbcore: registered new driver libusual
[04:35] <linux01> [17184440.440000]  Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
[04:35] <linux01> [17184440.440000]  usbcore: registered new driver usb-storage
[04:35] <linux01> [17184440.440000]  USB Mass Storage support registered.
[04:35] <sethk> st4hl, you need to tell dhcpd what range of addresses are available for assigning to clients
[04:35] <mook> I'm trying to compile something but it gives me this error when I type "make": "/bin/bash: autoheader: command not found       make: *** [config.h.in]  Error 127"
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> linux01: there you go, bam! it sees it now
[04:35] <LGKeiz> kingsqueak: doesn't windows search for ESSID's ?
[04:35] <sethk> linux01, ok, that's normal, but you should also see a message, after that, with a /dev/sdXX in it
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> linux01: what's the 'sd' device it shows shortly after that
[04:35] <hobbesmaster> I have a creative labs SB audigy LS, after some updates that update-manager got for me today, I no longer hav
[04:35] <sethk> linux01, sorry, /dev/sdX, not /dev/sdXX
[04:35] <hobbesmaster> e sound, nothing is muted
[04:35] <st4hl> i have subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { defs..}
[04:35] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: it can but it can also be manually setup
[04:36] <mook> I've installed GCC and build-essential... am I missing something?
[04:36] <linux01> nothing that is the last few lines when i "dmesg"
[04:36] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: did you setup the router?
[04:36] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: it could also have MAC security on it
[04:36] <sethk> st4hl, dod you have any fixed IPs, where you put the mac address into the dhcp config?
[04:36] <LGKeiz> Well I used windows search utility to find my networks I don't do it manually
[04:36] <Jbirk> can I bridge my network?
[04:36] <LGKeiz> Yeah I setup'd the router
[04:36] <st4hl> i dont
[04:36] <sethk> mook, autoconf
[04:36] <st4hl> well here's my problem
[04:36] <sethk> st4hl, might be a good idea to put your dhcpd.conf on the paste site
[04:37] <st4hl> i have eth0 for external, and i am trying to setup forwarding to eth1, to make a router
[04:37] <Lam_> bimberi: i figured as much, but is there a performance benefit?
[04:37] <Kingsqueak> linux01: right around that mass-storage device message a sg or sd device should have been assigned
[04:37] <st4hl> my dhcpd listens on eth1
[04:37] <g333k> how to upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[04:37] <Pelo> g'night guys
[04:37] <bimberi> Lam_: no idea sorry
[04:37] <st4hl> sec, thank you ;)
[04:37] <Kingsqueak> linux01: dmesg | less     then shift-g to go to the bottom and 'k' will scroll up
[04:37] <sethk> st4hl, ok, then you define the subnet for eth1 in the dhcpd.conf file.  nothing about eth0 for dhcp, if all requests arrive on eth1
[04:37] <m4jqp> when i reboot my computer it doesnt show text ... but if i boot into console mode and type startx i can see text ... how do i make it so that when i reboot it's the same as typin gstartx ?
[04:37] <LGKeiz> Kingsqueak: I have obviously no idea what to do now lol..
[04:38] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: I'm out of guesses
[04:38] <pjpeter> hi i just did a clean install and i saved some files on my other hard drive now i need to access my other harddrive can anyone help please
[04:38] <Lam_> bimberi: ok thanks
[04:38] <LGKeiz> Right now Im laning updating.. lol
[04:38] <Shadow_mil> g333k: change all dapper to edgy in /etc/apt/sources.list       then rune sudo apt-get update then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:38] <w30> m4jqp, I got that problem also when I compiled my own kernel and passed vga=791 to grub as a boot option so I took out the vga=791 option. I can't solve my problem either.
[04:38] <mook> sethk: Thank you!
[04:38] <LGKeiz> 9 minutes till updates are finished.. :p
[04:38] <rixxon> !i686
[04:38] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i686 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:39] <sethk> w30, try vga=ask
[04:39] <m4jqp> w30, couldn't get it working ?
[04:39] <rixxon> !686
[04:39] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 686 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:39] <LjL> !msg the bot
[04:39] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots  -  Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops... ;-)
[04:39] <david_> Can anyone tell me anything about how to go about fixing my display that doesn't update unless I move my mouse over it?  I've tried reconfiguring X, allocating more ram for my i810, and reinstalling xorg-server.  Does anyone have any ideas fro what I could do to fix my incorrectly updating display?
[04:39] <Kingsqueak> linux01: try   dmesg | grep removable
[04:40] <st4hl> sethk, here's my config http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30505/
[04:40] <rixxon> LjL: i'm sorry.
[04:40] <mook> I'm trying to compile something, but during the './configure' part, it dies early with this error: "configure: WARNING: *** No OpenGL found.     configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LIB_GL" was never defined."
[04:40] <w30> m4jqp, I think it was something with the virual terminals 1 through 6 because I didn't get those either, all I got was one terminal.
[04:40] <LGKeiz> Im bout to setup vnc on the laptop lanning from this computer, maybe that will help you KingSqueak lol
[04:40] <Cadteach> Anyone know the default CUPS username and password?
[04:40] <mook> I have 3D acceleration working (I'm running AIGLX + Beryl on an Intel card with Free 3D drivers)
[04:40] <bimberi> !cupsweb
[04:40] <ubotu> To enable the administration functions of the cups web interface - "sudo adduser cupsys shadow" then "sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart". Also, see !cups
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: got windows terminal services running?
[04:41] <m4jqp> w30, hmmm
[04:41] <mook> Why does it think OpenGL doesn't exist?
[04:41] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: 'rdesktop' is faster than vnc is
[04:41] <LGKeiz> ol..
[04:41] <LGKeiz> just waiting for ubuntu to finish updating...
[04:41] <clearzen> It seems that my server is not releasing cached memory. Is this normal? If not How can I force it to release the ram it has cached?
[04:42] <w30> m4jqp, Is your problem any think like that? I did not have a problem with a repository kernel just mine but it was made with old config so I donno.
[04:42] <Kingsqueak> LGKeiz: vnc to display what on what, Windows on the laptop or the other way?
[04:42] <Zantux> sup
[04:42] <Cadteach> bimberi: Is this a separate channel?
[04:42] <LGKeiz> no no, I'll setup VNC on the laptop, and forward the ports on my desktop which is DMZ to my modem <--> :P
[04:42] <LGKeiz> or rdesktop
[04:42] <LGKeiz> whatever
[04:42] <sethk> st4hl, the only thing I see in yours' that isn't in mine is the ddns-update-style line.
[04:43] <rixxon> `uname -r` gives 2.6.17-10-386 and `uname -m` i686. on dapper my kernel was -686 after apt-getting linux-686, does not work in edgy.
[04:43] <w30> m4jqp, do you get terminals 1 through 6 (ctrl alt f1 )?
[04:43] <LGKeiz> What is edgy?
[04:43] <sethk> st4hl, I think I'd put the DNS servers insside the subnet, but that's not causing your problem.
[04:43] <pjpeter> can anyone tell me how to access my other hard drive
[04:43] <m4jqp> w30, no i didn't make my own kernel ... basically i got the beta nvidia drivers working ... and went on to try to get beryl working, without knowing that i only had xorg 7.0.0 ... with no aiglx ... so it obviously didn't work so i uninstalled beryl and now i can't see text ... i donno what could have happened
[04:43] <w30> m4jqp, f2 f3 etc.
[04:43] <st4hl> ad-hoc? nod
[04:43] <bruenig> pjpeter, is it mounted?
[04:43] <linux01> kingsqueak dmesg | grep removable didnt do anything
[04:43] <rixxon> LGKeiz: ubuntu 6.10 is edgy eft.
[04:43] <LGKeiz> o_O
[04:43] <st4hl> how is your eth1 defined?
[04:43] <LGKeiz> How do you upgrade to it?
[04:43] <pjpeter> i can't seem to mount it
[04:44] <bruenig> pjpeter, what is its name?
[04:44] <rixxon> !upgrade | LGKeiz
[04:44] <ubotu> LGKeiz: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[04:44] <pjpeter> hdd
[04:44] <bruenig> pjpeter, and the filesystem?
[04:44] <pjpeter>  ext3
[04:44] <Prez> this is strange, my firefox 2.0 in 6.10 sometimes "loses" the up down arrows in bookmarks...
[04:44] <bruenig> pjpeter, is there a mount point you have set out for it or have you not made one?
[04:45] <pjpeter> not made one
[04:45] <sethk> Prez, if it is ff2.0, there are a few instabilities lurking in there.
[04:45] <LGKeiz> lol
[04:45] <rixxon> why can't i get a 686 kernel in edgy?
[04:45] <LGKeiz> awesome
[04:45] <bruenig> pjpeter, I would first do, sudo mkdir /media/hdd, to make the mount point, and then do sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdd /media/hdd to mount it to that mount point
[04:45] <LGKeiz> when Im finished updating, I'll upgrade lol
[04:45] <madelephant> can anyone help me with an ad-hoc connection problem?
[04:45] <st4hl> sethk i dont have anything defined for eth1 in /etc/network/interfaces
[04:46] <st4hl> could that be causing a problem?
[04:46] <Prez> sethk, guess so...
[04:46] <tw|sT3d> any one here who can help me?
[04:46] <sethk> st4hl, no, it shouldn't matter
[04:46] <st4hl> nod
[04:46] <bruenig> Prez, that is far too many bookmarks anyways :)
[04:46] <rat_> hi everybody!!
[04:46] <w30> m4jqp, so you think beryl took out more than it put in eh?
[04:46] <tw|sT3d> i think i have a simple prob for you guys
[04:46] <Prez> bruenig, haha, true... will have to trim it down..
[04:47] <tw|sT3d> buy this is my first tym using ubuntu
[04:47] <m4jqp> w30, lol yea basically :p
[04:47] <bruenig> tw|sT3d, what is your question?
[04:47] <knix> has the w32codecs package been removed in edgy?
[04:47] <tw|sT3d> how can i configure my internet connection
[04:47] <sethk> st4hl, do a  ps auxwww | grep dhcpd              see if perhaps there are some command line args to dhcpd
[04:47] <tw|sT3d> im using sa dial up modem
[04:47] <w30> m4jqp, I thought onl MS Windows did that :=)
[04:47] <bruenig> knix, it has never been available by default, you have to add other repos to get it
[04:48] <nalioth> !tell knix about restricted
[04:48] <w30> onl/only
[04:48] <tw|sT3d> i did tried d sudo pppconfig commnd which i read
[04:48] <m4jqp> w30, lol xgl owend my computer once too :p
[04:48] <david_>  hello, i was wondering if anyone knew of a bug where gnome/xorg does not update windows correctly?  For instance, I open gaim and I see nothing, but when I move the move over its buttons, they appear.  Likewise, scrolling a window corrupts its text, but minimize/maximize make the window look correct again.  Does anyone know a solution to this?
[04:48] <knix> ah, I removed freecontrib.org hehe, that explains it =)
[04:48] <tw|sT3d> but when i used the sudo pon i think im not connecting
[04:48] <sethk> david_, if you have frame buffer enabled, get rid of it
[04:48] <splintax> Problem: I cannot set ubuntu to display a widescreen resolution. Anyone have a solution?
[04:49] <david_> sethk, how do I enable/disable that?
[04:49] <mook> I'm trying to compile something, but during the './configure' part, it dies early with this error: "configure: WARNING: *** No OpenGL found.     configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LIB_GL" was never defined."
[04:49] <mzli> <david_> remove the sw,and reinstall

[04:49] <sethk> david_, run (as root) dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:49] <tw|sT3d> bruenig: can u please help me? coz i just receive my cd lst day
[04:49] <sethk> david_, or if you prefer you can look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but that's really not recommended.
[04:49] <david_> sethk, i'd feel better if I could just use vim to edit my xorg--it's heavily customized, and I always forget options
[04:50] <ironuckles> Hello, everyone.
[04:50] <bruenig> tw|sT3d, I don't know how to solve your problem, I have broadband and it just worked so never really got into the ins and out of networking
[04:50] <sethk> david_, back it up first.  :)
[04:50] <alexi5> hello
[04:50] <LGKeiz> Whats new in edgy?
[04:50] <alexi5> who in this chanel replaced their windows OS with ubuntu?
[04:50] <LGKeiz> alexi5 I have
[04:50] <LGKeiz> o_o
[04:50] <david_> sethk, i didn't find any of these patterns: "buffer, uffer, fb, FB"
[04:50] <LGKeiz> Just now
[04:50] <LGKeiz> :p
[04:50] <bruenig> alex_ubuntu, I did
[04:50] <Jbirk> I did
[04:50] <ironuckles> Is there any non pain-in-the-ass way to set up a monitor with my laptop, so I can use it as a second screen?
[04:51] <sethk> LGKeiz, I imagine everyone
[04:51] <alexi5> was i worth it?
[04:51] <Jbirk> I have 2 computers running Ubuntu Dapper
[04:51] <Jbirk> and 1 running XP still
[04:51] <Jbirk> Yes, it was
[04:51] <bruenig> alexi5, I did
[04:51] <wastrel> ironuckles:  probably not
[04:51] <alexi5> ok
[04:51] <tw|sT3d> bruenig: waaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[04:51] <Jbirk> I would recomend y ou have 2 computers though
[04:51] <tw|sT3d> im dead
[04:51] <LGKeiz> sethk - uhm Whats new in Edgy?
[04:51] <Jbirk> 1 for Windows and one for Ubuntu
[04:51] <trabajadores> how i install xgl
[04:51] <alexi5> ok
[04:51] <Kingsqueak> alexi5: it's totally worth it unless you depend on it for gaming and have some patience learning a new OS
[04:51] <Jbirk> apt-get install xserver-xgl
[04:51] <bruenig> tw|sT3d, somebody else might know, address your questions to the channel not me
[04:51] <Jbirk> tha tis how I did it
[04:51] <LGKeiz> My laptop is Ubuntu and my desktop which Im on is Windows
[04:51] <sethk> LGKeiz, no idea, too new for me to worry about.
[04:51] <Kingsqueak> alexi5: it's not windows...you have to learn how it works
[04:51] <alexi5> i have used freebsd for 2 years
[04:51] <rat_> trabajadores, i have a great guide to install XGL using beryl
[04:51] <Jbirk> then apt-get install beryl
[04:52] <dvdogrila> well i got my monitor working. he is a simple question how do i get my buddies to show up in kopete?
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> alexi5: ah, you should pick it up fine then
[04:52] <trabajadores> can you give me that???
[04:52] <alexi5> linux is similar to unix
[04:52] <tw|sT3d> ok
[04:52] <rat_> sure
[04:52] <bruenig> dvdogrila, you have to add them...
[04:52] <ironuckles> wastrel, good to know.
[04:52] <alexi5> ok
[04:52] <Kingsqueak> alexi5: it's simpler than freebsd, if you do a workstation build it will do much for you automatically
[04:52] <w30> alexi5, I did via RedHat Slackware Fedora Ubuntu
[04:52] <sizzam_> when i try to add an OGG podcast to my iPod with gtkpod, i get a 'filetype unknown' error.  anyone know what im doing wrong?
[04:52] <wastrel> ironuckles:  there are ways but they're generally tweaky and annoying to set up.  depends on your video card.
[04:53] <rat_> trabajadores, http://lhansen.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-desktop-beryl-and-xgl-on-ubuntu-edgy.html   its for edgy ...

[05:01] <mook> I have 3D acceleration working (I'm running AIGLX + Beryl on an Intel card with Free 3D drivers), so doesn;t that mean I have OpenGL installed also?

[05:01] <`axion> hi, i'm worried i might have a compromised system. netstat is reporting some open ports that are unknwon to me. could anyone help me understand what they are for?
[05:01] <FunnyLookinHat> dvdogrila, i've heard people have had a lot of success with banshee and gtkpod
[05:02] <stevenx> nalioth: thank you !!
[05:02] <strabes> dvdogrila: there's many. rhythmbox & amarok are both itunes-like programs which will also sync your ipod
[05:02] <poningru> tw|sT3d: hmm the problem in the us is that some isps require their windows installed stuff
[05:02] <poningru> tw|sT3d: like juno
[05:02] <sethk> `axion, sure, most likely.  use the -p flag with netstat to find out what processes are listening on those ports
[05:02] <strabes> dvdogrila: gtkpod only does ipod syncing
[05:02] <Hatty> evil-hell There is #ubuntu-fr
[05:02] <`axion> sethk: i did...its blank for them
[05:02] <tw|sT3d> waaaa i dnt know dat =((

[05:03] <tw|sT3d> btw how do i know my... device name
[05:03] <virtualchaos_> hey all... in about a 20 second cycle my drive head parks, then unparks, and parks again... i'm using inotify to watch my file system, but it doesn't show any activity when it happens, but i'm also running wmhdplop which monitors hard disk throughput, which shows definite throughput to unpark it. is there any way i can find out what's causing that throughput?
[05:03] <sethk> `axion, paste one line.  sounds like they aren't real, they are just artifacts of netstat.  either paste one line here, or paste the entire output to the paste web site.

[05:05] <nalioth> evil-hell: have you been to #ubuntu-fr  they speak french there
[05:06] <sethk> `axion, usually that's related to NFS mounts.  If your box is not an NFS server, you can turn those off.
[05:06] <evil-hell> ok tnx
[05:06] <`axion> with the exception of dhclient3 (i use static ip configuration...does it still need port 68 listening on udp?)
[05:06] <evil-hell> mush tnx
[05:06] <mook> nalioth, sethk: Any idea which -dev packages have the OpenGL development libraries?
[05:06] <wastrel> prolly libgl something

[05:09] <isai> hi
[05:09] <isai> I need to have some scripts to set environment variables on every boot. Is /etc/init.d the right place to put them?
[05:10] <sethk> isai, no.  for one thing, /etc/init.d is a directory
[05:10] <`axion> isai: on boot or on logon?
[05:10] <sethk> isai, the usual place is in $HOME/.bashrc.  sometimes $HOME/.bash_profile
[05:10] <LGKeiz> Im new to the whole install thing If I wanted to install FireFox 2.0 I have the taz, how would I install it, :P
[05:11] <isai> sethk, I need the environment variables usable for everyone on the system, not just one user.
[05:11] <Tompu> isai: /etc/rc.local
[05:11] <sethk> isai, then /etc/profile
[05:11] <sethk> isai, or /etc/bash.bashrc
[05:11] <Tompu> isai: sethk is more correct than me

[05:13] <isai> sethk, Tompu, thanks, I'll put them in /etc/profile and see what happens.
[05:13] <`axion> Station: did you try editing xorg.conf?
[05:15] <isai> sethk, does /etc/profile get rewritten on a dist-upgrade or any other upgrades?
[05:15] <sethk> isai, no, I don't believe so.
[05:15] <Tompu> sethk: is there a way to get dpkg etc to identify what package a file belongs to?
[05:16] <sethk> Tompu, install apt-file.   then:   apt-file search filename
[05:16] <bimberi> sethk: well written upgrade scripts identify differences and offer to keep the current config file
[05:16] <Tompu> sethk: cheers
[05:16] <sethk> bimberi, I wouldn't disagree with that statement.

[05:32] <blackvd> ha
[05:32] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: now it will ;-)
[05:32] <`axion> i had problems with bcmwl5 until i tried wifi-radar
[05:32] <Boelcke> Argh. My CUPS printing just stopped working. When I hit print, the application hangs. When I select System, Admin, Printing, no window appears. Any suggestions on where to look to re-install printing?
[05:32] <nothlit> is there a command to tell what repository a package is from?
[05:32] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> axion - that doesn't help
[05:32] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I never got WPA working manually with wpa_supplicant either btw
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ? wifi
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> err
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ? wiki
[05:33] <madelephant> can anyone see what i'm typing?
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> .. or not
[05:33] <bimberi> nothlit: apt-cache policy package
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> madel - yeah
[05:33] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Yeah, lol, since it works fine now, eh. And how come you got WPA2 to work without wpa_supplicant?
[05:33] <`axion> it sure did for me
[05:33] <blackvd> not sure
[05:33] <madelephant> hah just makin sure
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> axion - where is wifi blah :<
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> errr
[05:33] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> wiki
[05:33] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: because network-manager does it for me ;-)
[05:33] <madelephant> i got the (broadcom) bcm4318 card to work with ndiswrapper
[05:33] <maxflax> madelephant, 0.o
[05:33] <nothlit> bimberi, tytyty :D
[05:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Network-manager isn 't giving me a network list
[05:34] <bimberi> nothlit: np :)
[05:34] <madelephant> i can connect to wireless access points but can't connect to an ad-hoc
[05:34] <`axion> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: in the universe repo!
[05:34] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nor am I able to enter any networks lol
[05:34] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: haha, sucky thing is how I'm scared to bring back network-manager with this config, lol
[05:34] <Kingsqueak> madelephant: I saw you earlier, I've just never tried ad-hoc mode so I have no clue why you don't get your IP
[05:34] <`axion> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: a simple google returned: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/wifi-radar
[05:34] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: I mean nm-applet
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: that's actually part of the network-manager package
[05:35] <madelephant> kingsq- any ideas where i would start looking to solve the prob?
[05:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Im using 6.06 dapper
[05:35] <blackvd> if i can pull a wireless list how come i cant connect. not sure where to look?
[05:35] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: How come nm-applet is different from network-manager?
[05:35] <`axion> same difference
[05:35] <`axion> http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/wifi-radar
[05:35] <Yourname> Kingsqueak: Oh, yeah, that's what I thought, heh
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> Yourname: it's part of the same package, that'w what I meant
[05:35] <libervisco> Where can I find edgy font.conf?
[05:35] <madelephant> is wifi-radar a lot better than network-manager?
[05:35] <libervisco> to put in dapper
[05:35] <Kingsqueak> madelephant: no clue outside of, are you sure there is a dhcp server on the client side?
[05:35] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ok now how do I do the source.list thingy
[05:35] <nothlit> Is there a command to reload .bashrc?
[05:35] <khermans> [flash9] : mkdir /tmp/flash9 && cd /tmp/flash9 && wget http://www.adobe.com/go/fp9_update_b1_installer_linuxplugin && tar zxvf *.tar.gz && rm -rf *.tar.gz && cd * && sudo cp *.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/
[05:35] <Yourname> How do I start sshd?
[05:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> `axion I'm new to this Ubuntu thing lol
[05:36] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> or unix for that matter
[05:36] <Kingsqueak> madelephant: the client/server you are connecting to will need to have dhcp up or you will need to assign an IP manually I think
[05:36] <khermans> young, /etc/init.d/sshd restart

[05:38] <Hatty> OKay. Ubuntu refuses to boot. GRUB loads fine, then it boots into the ubuntu loader. I see no splash or messages (update-grub couldnt find image, quiet is set). After about 3 mins it just hangs for some reason. Im currently in the Dapper LiveCD. Help?
[05:38] <nothlit> bimberi, lol ok, what framebuffer does ubuntu use as a default, and how would i go about accelerating it if i have an nvidia comp, also is it true that vesafb doesn't go over vga=791

[05:42] <`axion> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: i strongly suggest you utilize google.com before asking further questions. that's what i did to help you so far...as you can tell it takes seconds
[05:42] <bimberi> nalioth: reggiN too
[05:42] <cge> oh dear
[05:42] <`axion> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: same rules apply for dapper with the replacement of 'edgy' with 'dapper'

[05:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> what
[05:43] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Im confused
[05:44] <bimberi> !upgrade | addict3d
[05:44] <ubotu> addict3d: For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[05:44] <jrib> Goomie: var=${dir}${file}   but I am no expert, check the docs at tldp.org
[05:44] <Goomie> jrib: i didnt know it was that easy
[05:44] <Hatty> What are the default "defoptions" in /boot/grub/menu.lst supposed to be?
[05:45] <compudaze> default options
[05:45] <Hatty> compudaze: the value
[05:45] <cge> Hatty: the default options you want for the kernel
[05:45] <compudaze> when u run update-grub those options are applied to all your kernels
[05:45] <jrib> Goomie: you might need quotes around that whole thing to prevent problems with spaces
[05:45] <Hatty> ..What i mean is: what is it set to by default
[05:45] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ok so
[05:45] <cge> Hatty: Like quiet splash if you like usplash, or vga=791 if you like smaller text
[05:45] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Im in the source.list
[05:45] <compudaze> # defoptions=quiet splash
[05:45] <compudaze> stays commented
[05:45] <Hatty> thanks
[05:45] <bimberi> Hatty: mine has: # defoptions=quiet splash
[05:46] <Hatty> splash doesnt work for me: i did update-grub and it said it could not find the splash image
[05:47] <madelephant> kingsq- for some reason windows machines have no problem pulling an ip from the ad-hoc connect
[05:47] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> sigh..
[05:47] <madelephant> ah damn he quit
[05:48] <Hatty> "Searching for splash image ... none found, skipping ..." <- update-grub
[05:48] <bimberi> Hatty: are you trying to fix that?  otherwise perhaps just leave it out from the defoptions line
[05:48] <Hatty> bimberi: Im trying to fix it because i cant see whats going on when i boot and it seems to hang
[05:48] <bimberi> Hatty: this might help ...
[05:48] <bimberi> !usplash | Hatty
[05:48] <ubotu> Hatty: usplash is the start-up splash (before the login screen appears) in Ubuntu. To customize it, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto
[05:49] <maxflax> How do I get LCDproc to load during boot in ubuntu?
[05:49] <bimberi> Hatty: instead of customising you can use one of the images in /usr/share/pixmaps/splash
[05:49] <maxflax> I tried adding the LCDproc debian initscript.. but that didn't fly
[05:50] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> It's not that easy
[05:50] <firebird619> Could someone help me? I downloaded Flash 9 Beta and placed the libflashplayer.so in the proper directories for Firefox and Opera, but when I try to view pages with flash content, it is just a white space where the flash should be.
[05:50] <Hatty> bimberi: also, when i add vga=xxx (I tried 791 and 788) it says invalid mode
[05:51] <bimberi> Hatty: sorry, i don't know much about that one :|
[05:51] <Hatty> I remember fixing this problem in gentoo but i had to like enable every signle display module in menuconfig
[05:52] <Eleaf> hmm
=== fiveiron_ is now known as fiveiron
[05:52] <maxflax> Or does the new stuff in Edgy prevent stuff from loading from init.d?`
[05:53] <charle97> firebird619, did you close the browsers completely before testing?
[05:54] <Hatty> if I disable the spash defoption, will it just disable splash image?
[05:54] <firebird619> charle97: Yes. Firefox's about:plugins shows Flash 9, it just doesn't work for some reason.
[05:54] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> axion, you there?
[05:54] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> What is the deb and deb-src url do I put so It can find Wifi-radar?
[05:55] <charle97> firebird619, are you using the noscript extension?
[05:55] <firebird619> charle97: No, I am not.
[05:55] <yoink> exit
[05:55] <charle97> firebird619, where did you put the libflash file for firefox?
[05:56] <maxflax> Is there a interface to the event.d for adding jobs?
[05:56] <nothlit> Hatty, you should still be able to switch to the console interface with ctrl+alt+f(1?) to see whats going on during boot
[05:57] <Hatty> nothlit: no =/ My comp doesnt like that
[05:57] <Hatty> IBM == EVIL
[05:57] <ice_1963> Bitchx is good but irssi is better :)
[05:57] <nothlit> Hatty, it should disable the splash option if you get rid of it in the def option and the kernel entry
[05:58] <LoneShadow> anyone good with snat/dnat rules ?
[05:58] <firebird619> charle97: I put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins as well as /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
[05:58] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, it seems to be in the universe repository, at least in edgy
[05:59] <dacableguy> i cannot get my hp photosmart 3200 to print with edgy :-(
[06:00] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nothlit - it's not in dapper but it's supported, blah this is giving me a headache
[06:00] <firebird619> charle97: I use KDE and I tried in Konqueror as well and when I go to sites with flash, it comes up with the Crash Handler for nspluginviewer (I think this is the correct name).
[06:00] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> how would I manually install it If I downloaded it manually
[06:00] <Hatty> Everytime i remove the defopts and update-grub, it readds them... >.> I NEED to get rid of quiet and splash
[06:00] <dacableguy> it worked perfectly fine with dapper....added it via the administration>printing dialog...select hp, choose driver, past in the uri, worked perfectly
[06:00] <charle97> firebird619, hmm... don't know what could be wrong
[06:01] <nothlit> what the significance of the number in brackets in a man entry such as  tun(4), hosts.equiv(5), ssh_config(5), ssh-keysign(8), sshd(8)
[06:01] <Hatty> its the section
[06:01] <dacableguy> it wont work at all with edgy, and im doing the exact same thing
[06:01] <Hatty> ie tun(4) = an entry in section 4
[06:01] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, once you download it, navigate to its location in the console then type sudo dpkg -i <packagename>.deb
[06:01] <Hatty> so if there were two tun entries, tun(4) and tun(5) youd get tun(4) via man 4 tun and tun(5) via man 5 tun
[06:01] <nalioth> nothlit: page numbers
[06:02] <addict3d> ubotu: but that page says i need those ubuntu-desktop or minimal packages to upgrade to edgy in console :(
[06:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about but that page says i need those ubuntu-desktop or minimal packages to upgrade to edgy in console :( - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:02] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you should also be able to just double click on it and there should be deb installer program with a gui
[06:02] <firebird619> charle97: In Konqueror, when I right click in the white space where the flash should be, it talks about Flash 7. Could Flash 7 be installed somewhere that I am unaware about and causing a conflict?
[06:02] <nothlit> ty Hatty  nalioth
[06:02] <nalioth> !tell addict3d about yourself
[06:03] <charle97> firebird619, it might
[06:03] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> you mean the source packages? nothlit?
[06:03] <firebird619> charle97: How would I go about finding out and completly removing flash 7?
[06:03] <charle97> firebird619, did you have flash 7 on ff before?

[06:05] <Draconicus> My kernel module doesn't update with the package.
[06:05] <ashzilla> What should I do in this situation? Force and installation of the packages or edit my repositories? Or what?
[06:05] <nalioth> ashzilla: are you using official repos?
[06:06] <Chris-Waterguy> Nalioth: one or both are console proggies, yes... but I don't see them on the console.
[06:06] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you said download the <package> manually, anyways to compile from source extract the archive go into the directory type configure then make, then sudo make install
[06:06] <addict3d> nalioth: i couldnt find a way out .. think i should use the GUI .. well thanks anyway
[06:06] <firebird619> charle97: Flash 9 must be half installed correctly beings FF recognizes it. But there is certainly something wrong.
[06:06] <KHatfull_> howdy
[06:06] <ashzilla> nalioth: I don't know
[06:06] <nalioth> ashzilla: if you've used non-official repos, this can happen. program incompatibilitys will occur and upgrades become dicey
[06:06] <ashzilla> nalioth: can you link me to official repos sources.list
[06:06] <nalioth> Chris-Waterguy: when you type 'ccal' <enter> in a terminal, nothing happens?
[06:06] <nalioth> !tell ashzilla about repos
[06:06] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu,  but you have to make sure the package build-essential is installed
[06:06] <nalioth> ashzilla: if you've used unofficial repos in the past, you're probably gonna have lots of trouble
[06:07] <charle97> firebird619, maybe take out one of the files out
[06:07] <charle97> since you have it in two places
[06:07] <ashzilla> nalioth: so what do you recommend I do.
[06:07] <ashzilla> nalioth: I don't have time for a reinstall... I have work documents I need access to via a buggy vmware
[06:07] <nalioth> ashzilla: hope the repos you use update their packages soon
[06:08] <firebird619> charle97: Yes, I can give that a try. Flash 7 must still be hanging around in somewhere thought beings it shows that on the right click in Konqueror.
[06:08] <Draconicus> What's the fix for the restricted modules bug?
[06:08] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, there should be a readme included with most source packages
[06:08] <Chris-Waterguy> nalioth: "when you type 'ccal' <enter> in a terminal, nothing happens?" - yes, that's correct.
[06:08] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> urgggh
[06:08] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Im getitng confused
[06:08] <ashzilla> nalioth: http://pastebin.com/818828 that's my sources.list ... what do you recommend?
[06:09] <nalioth> ashzilla: that looks good, have you used non official repos in the past?
[06:09] <ashzilla> nalioth: Eh, I couldn't say for certain.
[06:10] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> make sure I have build-essential installed, what is that?
[06:10] <Chris-Waterguy> nalioth: sorry... not true. when I type ccal in a terminal, I get a little picture of a calendar in month view, inside the terminal. Just an image, not interactive.
[06:10] <ashzilla> nalioth: How can I just run a force install of the held back packages?
[06:10] <anderbubble> is there any way to get rhythmbox to automatically move your media files around to match their tags like in itunes?
[06:10] <nalioth> Chris-Waterguy: in your terminal, "man ccal" <enter>
[06:10] <nalioth> ashzilla: when you force things, they can break.
[06:10] <firebird619> charle97: I will give removing it from one of the places a try. Thank you for your help.
[06:10] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you want to install from source correct?
[06:10] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Yeah..
[06:10] <ashzilla> nalioth: vmware isn't working, I gotta' give it a shot :)
[06:10] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Since I can't get it in the repo..
[06:10] <Tompu> anderbubble: no
[06:11] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> unless you know what I need to add to source.list
[06:11] <nalioth> ashzilla: you could try removing all of the listed packages and upgradeing from the sources.list you showed in your pastebin
[06:11] <anderbubble> Tompu, any suggestions for an alternate player that does/can?
[06:11] <Tompu> anderbubble: amarok, probably
[06:11] <ashzilla> nalioth: just use -remove to all the listed packages held back?
[06:11] <ashzilla> nalioth: and then dist-upgrade
[06:11] <anderbubble> Tompu, grumble grumble... qt... grumble grumble
[06:12] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nothlit - well.. what do I do..
[06:12] <nalioth> ashzilla: that is one way
[06:12] <whatthedeuce> Hey.  I'm installing Ubuntu on an old laptop using the alternate install cd, but it doesn't detect my wireless card.  I found this guide to get it working: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=74651 but it requires the internet to install everything.  Is there any other way I could get it working?  I don't have any non-wireless internet connection
[06:12] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you've downloaded the source 'package' correct?
[06:12] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> yeah.
[06:12] <Chris-Waterguy> nalioth... reading 'man ccal', it seems maybe I misunderstood what ccal would do... I thought it would replace the calendar in my panel, but actually it's "a drop in replacement for the standard unix calendar program." so I guess it's a command line prog. (blushes)
[06:12] <Chris-Waterguy> thanks
[06:13] <st4hl> hi, i am trying to add a script to rc2.d but i keep getting "not found" in log
[06:13] <nalioth> Chris-Waterguy: :)   it's all good.
[06:13] <st4hl> something like "/etc/init.d/rc: 2: /etc/rc2.d/S95myscript: not found"
[06:13] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nothlit =.=
[06:14] <ashzilla> nalioth: I appriciate the help. Thanks
[06:14] <nalioth> ashzilla: when one uses non official stuff, it can get interesting come time to upgrade
[06:14] <maxflax> st4hl, is it for getting something to load during boot?
[06:14] <st4hl> nothing
[06:14] <st4hl> i think i found my error
[06:14] <st4hl> it doesnt have .sh ;)
[06:15] <Chris-Waterguy> I seem to have figured out Remind, too - the graphical prog is actually tkremind. (Just read the SPM description more carefully)
[06:15] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, ok, point me to the page where you have the package you want to download

[06:18] <nalioth> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: you need "build-essential"
[06:18] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> Why do I get "build-essential"
[06:18] <nalioth> LGKeiz-Ubuntu: they contain "make" and other build tools
[06:18] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, once you've downloaded it, find it in your file browser and double click it

[06:18] <theplateau> does anyone know about mapping keys?
[06:19] <theplateau> my left alt and ctrl work but the right doesnt
[06:19] <phargle> using a mechanical structure that actually presses the other keys is the only way
[06:19] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, if its on that website, it should be in the universe repository
[06:19] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> okay
[06:19] <phargle> well, maybe not the *only* way.
[06:20] <crimsun> max_: you need libk3b2-mp3 from universe
[06:20] <crimsun> max_: note that's only for mp3 not wma.

[06:20] <Ch1ppy> hey, I've got a second monitor set up in X and such, but I want to be able to disable it sometimes (like for games)  is there any way to do that without modifying my xorg.conf and restarting X?
[06:21] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> nothlit - uhm wifi-radar nor anything else is picking up a wireless signal.. It works because I have my windows system working with wireless, Im on my laptop which is wired to my pc, It has a internal wireless card, It had Windows on it before hand and worked fine with the wireless internet, eth1 is my wireless settings, and it is being detected, but yet no wireless networks, any idea why.
[06:21] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you should follow this guide to add the extra repositories if you want to inshttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu?highlight=%28repository%29tall stuff from the extra two repositories in the future
[06:22] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, sorry, the computers i've installed ubuntu on don't use wireless
[06:22] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> .. I have no idea why
[06:22] <nothlit> LGKeiz-Ubuntu, you should ask people about ndiswrapper though, probably
[06:22] <LGKeiz-Ubuntu> ndiswrapper = ?
[06:23] <ClayG> if you could choose any laptop you 'd like and want all the features, nice vid card, webcam bluetooth,etc
[06:23] <ClayG> which would it be
[06:23] <Nchalada> somethin i could build meself?
[06:23] <Nchalada> lol

[06:23] <daxlett_> I just installed Python, now how do I save .py files?  I'm running it via terminal as of now, but i'm sure that is wrong.
[06:24] <nalioth> daxlett_: .py files are text files
[06:24] <wickedpuppy>  daxlett_ actually anywhere will do ...
[06:24] <daxlett_> Oh!
[06:24] <wickedpuppy> as long as you installed python properly of course :P
[06:25] <daxlett_> So running it from the terminal is the right way of doing it?

[06:25] <bean> hi, i'm trying to install edgy on my acer 3012 lappy.. i wanted a light install but the server cd can't mount my cdrom drive. the desktop cd boots up fine though. would it be possible to do a server install off the desktop cd?

[06:25] <daxlett_> I get it now

[06:38] <marcrosoft> can apt compile things..?
[06:38] <ithiel> marcrosoft, no.
[06:38] <ithiel> in other news, my cat cannot win the war in Iraq.
[06:38] <JayFM> Omg. I'm screwed :)

[06:38] <compudaze> marcrosoft, in a sense, yes, but probably not what u need
[06:38] <gleesond> is there a way to search for items using apt-get
[06:38] <JayFM> Does anyone know why my computer may not be able see both of my HDD's?
[06:39] <ithiel> apt-cache
[06:39] <KDan> gleesond: try using aptitude, too
[06:39] <compudaze> or aptitude search
[06:39] <ithiel> gleesond: apt-cache or synaptic && -f
[06:39] <wickedpuppy> items like files ? or packages ?
[06:39] <ithiel> aptitude, ewww.
[06:39] <compudaze> aptitude is very powerful for searching
[06:39] <KDan> ithiel: aptitude is better than a kick in the butt :-)
[06:39] <pjv> JayFM: is it on dmesg
[06:39] <gleesond> oooo I like aptitude
[06:39] <gleesond> nice
[06:39] <defrysk> aptitude is sometimes too powerfull
[06:39] <gleesond> thanks
[06:39] <Tonren> ithiel: I thought aptitude was better than apt-get at handling dependencies.
[06:39] <JayFM> dmesg?
[06:40] <defrysk> it does what you want and for the inexperienced also what you do not want
[06:40] <nothlit> how is aptitude too powerful? its great
[06:40] <KDan> surely if you don't know what you want you definitely don't know what you don't want
[06:40] <bimberi> !aptitude
[06:40] <ubotu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT, like apt-get. However, aptitude can remember the dependencies installed with a package and remove them if you uninstall. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptitudeSurvivalGuide
[06:40] <ZeroSmoke> yo
[06:40] <ZeroSmoke> got a kicker
[06:40] <KDan> and if you don't know what you don't want, what do you know?
[06:40] <defrysk> Tonren, aptitude can wipe complete instalationsets just for one dependency
[06:41] <ithiel> Tonren: I dislike aptitude...might be a prejudice, but I have been using Linux too long to care.
[06:41] <Tonren> Hmm.
[06:41] <ZeroSmoke> want to install xubuntu from my ubuntu os
[06:41] <eobanb> i dislike aptitude also
[06:41] <nothlit> ZeroSmoke, sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop

[06:41] <ithiel> lol.
[06:41] <b0ss_> yep.
[06:42] <eobanb> ZeroSmoke, i'd burn to CD>
[06:42] <b0ss_> yeah
[06:42] <compudaze> dont people run linux as their primary os?
[06:42] <b0ss_> and partition
[06:42] <defrysk> I do
[06:42] <b0ss_> yeah
[06:42] <ZeroSmoke> well that would be swell but i don't have a cd burner
[06:42] <b0ss_> <<<<<<<<<
[06:42] <b0ss_> b0ss does
[06:42] <nothlit> If you load the iso in, your installation can add it as a repository, then you should issue the command previously stated
[06:42] <defrysk> ZeroSmoke, buy one
[06:42] <compudaze> i guess we're different
[06:42] <b0ss_> i orderd my cd
[06:42] <sethk> compudaze, of course
[06:42] <dustin> where can i get some cool pixel art
[06:42] <compudaze> i got vmware running windows for stuff that dont work with wine
[06:42] <b0ss_> i brougth my cd from my frin for 1 dollar
[06:42] <sethk> compudaze, I have it as my primary o/s on eight machines.  I have windows only on one
[06:42] <fyre|work> ZeroSmoke: you don't need the iso image, you can just download the packages that are required from the net via apt-get/aptitude/synaptic.
[06:43] <bimberi> only if its the alternate cd
[06:43] <eobanb> surely there will come a time when we'll routinely install from other booted systems, but until that day comes you'll be burning to CD
[06:43] <bimberi> desktop cd doesn't have the packages, just a small set with things like ndiswrapper and build-essential

[06:44] <ZeroSmoke> no idea?
[06:44] <compudaze> ZeroSmoke, which cdimage?
[06:44] <eobanb> ZeroSmoke, i assume virtual PC is booting ubuntu from an image, not a real hard drive?
[06:44] <fyre|work> ZeroSmoke: you don't need to download the image again. Just sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[06:44] <ZeroSmoke> xubuntu desktop
[06:44] <compudaze> the desktop cd doesn't have a pool, correct?
[06:44] <ZeroSmoke> ok i'll try that thanks
[06:44] <defrysk> ZeroSmoke, go to your local pcmagazxinestore and see if one of the magazines contains an image or something
[06:44] <sethk> nol13, can't say without knowing where the routers sit, and why you have two routers
[06:44] <compudaze> just install from apt/aptitude/synaptic/etc
[06:45] <hyphenated> nol13: generally, you do all of the configuration on your router/modem, and nothing on the ubuntu side. that's what portforward.com should have told you

[06:46] <Neil3> hmm interesting
[06:46] <bimberi> no nothlit, not much use with the desktop cd

[06:52] <ZeroSmoke> well it appears to be working, it says 99%
[06:52] <lucas9000> fyre: i'll try putting the file name in quotes...thanks!
[06:53] <Sutur> defrysk: Please explain "safe interoperatibility"?
[06:53] <ZeroSmoke> it wouldn't take the xubuntu iso, but it took the alternate iso and is working on it so far
[06:53] <Sutur> defrysk: Never mind.
[06:53] <nol13> wait now its saying im firewalled again
[06:53] <defrysk> Sutur, on fat32 you can safely read/write on both osses

[06:55] <morphix> has there been any current improvement for the Asus P5W DH Deluxe motherboard support? after compiling 2.6.18.1 kernel.. the system boots up.. but when i run something such as firefox and start a download, or run thunar the system locks up
[06:55] <ZeroSmoke> ok time for some food while this thing works its butt off
[06:55] <defrysk> nol13, if you dont dislike kde apps you should try ktorrent
[06:55] <defrysk> its very good and is low on resources
[06:55] <morphix> wish there was support for it in ubuntu where im not forced to compile my own kernel
[06:56] <Sutur> White I'm in here, can anyone shout out a name of a linux alternative to dvdshrink (compress a dvd to a smaller dvd image)?

[06:56] <nol13> defrysk: right on, does each torrent have its own window? thats why ive been using azureus
[06:56] <hyphenated> Sutur: yes
[06:56] <lucas9000> nol13: are you using azureus?  i used utorrent on xp but haven't tried setting up azureus on ubuntu yet
[06:57] <Sutur> Thanks :D
[06:57] <defrysk> nol13, the latest versions from development also have rss support now
[06:57] <babwe> azureus is easy t set up on ubuntu
[06:58] <nothlit> theres also deluge and torrentflux
[06:58] <nol13> was using regular bittorrent client forrever then tried utorrent for the partial downloads, then azureus because it was nice having everything in one window
[06:58] <nothlit> lucas9000, you can use utorrent if you use wine
[06:58] <nol13> what does rss support do for me?
[06:58] <defrysk> nol13, http://buntudot.org/people/~jdong/ktorrent/ try it its as good as utorrent (almost)
[06:58] <nothlit> nol13, rss can automatically download things for you

[07:00] <tritium> zipzo: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[07:00] <nothlit> lucas9000, oh ok, but if you do install wine, utorrent runs flawlessly, but if you want torrents to automatically get passed to it from your browser you'll have to do some extra work
[07:00] <tritium> fyre|work: gcc is a dependency of build-essential
[07:00] <nothlit> zipzo, sudo aptitude install build-essential
[07:00] <lucas9000> after using utorrent for so long i can't go back to bittornado
[07:00] <nol13> nothlit: dont things automatically download anywhay?
[07:00] <fyre|work> tritium: ah yes, thanks :)
[07:01] <lucas9000> nothlit: if azureus works and has some of the features i liked in utorrent i'll probably just use it
[07:01] <nothlit> nol13, no, it will find things and automatically download it without you asking

[07:02] <BeanBag> 
[07:03] <nol13> how does it know what to download?  (giving ktorrent a try now)
[07:03] <lab2std> 
[07:03] <nothlit> lucas9000, very few have dht and individual file selection, if you have more advanced needs
[07:03] <explorar> Help. I am trying to accessing my ntfs partition and creating a mount point then mount it, but I receieved permission denied when I tried to access it. What should I do?
[07:03] <compudaze> Xaxafrad, u can try xubuntu
[07:03] <bimberi> Xaxafrad: xubuntu might, otherwise a minimal install with fluxbox
[07:03] <nothlit> nol13, you give it an "rss feed" or search options
[07:03] <lucas9000> nothlit: individual file selection is definitely one of the features from utorrent that i love
[07:03] <nothlit> lucas9000, you are pretty much stuck with azureus and utorrent then
[07:04] <Xaxafrad> thanks
[07:04] <lucas9000> oh ok
[07:04] <compudaze> theres webbased torrentflux which i like
[07:04] <defrysk> lucas9000, ktorrent does that
[07:04] <nothlit> if you use torrentflux. i would recommend downloading ubuntu system panel, it has torrentflux built in
[07:04] <ZeroSmoke> what's wrong with bearshare?
[07:04] <babwe> nothlit do u know howto setup bittorrent in ubuntu
[07:05] <lucas9000> defrysk: do i have to switch to kde/kubuntu to use that?
[07:05] <defrysk> nope
[07:05] <Vlet> How can I copy ("burn") an iso to a usb drive?
[07:05] <defrysk> lucas9000, I would get the latest from here tho : http://buntudot.org/people/~jdong/ktorrent/
[07:05] <compudaze> u dont Vlet
[07:05] <lucas9000> cool i'll check those out
[07:05] <compudaze> which iso?
[07:05] <BeanBag> how do i change mi resolution? it does not want to change?
[07:05] <nothlit> lucas9000, you can install kde apps just fine without kde, but it will install kdelibs and your applications will not be as integrated with your gnome desktop
[07:06] <ZeroSmoke> beanbag, what os are you installing?
[07:06] <Vlet> compudaze: Why not? I would like to put the ubuntu installation on a 1GB thumb drive.
[07:06] <nothlit> Vlet, you'd have to set up a sysimage

[07:06] <lucas9000> nothlit: so basically the k apps wouldn't automatically show up in the "applications" menu and that kidn of thing?
[07:06] <nothlit> Vlet, because booting from a usb drive DOES NOT WORK LIKE A CD
[07:06] <nothlit> lucas9000, no it will show up in the menu
[07:07] <Vlet> nothlit: ahh. Oh well.
[07:07] <nothlit> lucas9000, just the buttons and colors will have a different theme inside the window
[07:07] <compudaze> Vlet, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
[07:07] <nol13> right on, ill check this out, and go read the wiki, sorry if i wadted your time with the ports thing, seems ok for now i think..........     for now.
[07:07] <Vlet> thanks compudaze
[07:07] <dustin> is there a decent virtual desktop switcher?
[07:07] <lucas9000> ok cool
[07:07] <compudaze> decent?
[07:07] <ZeroSmoke> beanbag, you can edit the xorg file refresh rates and resolutions, but easier beforehand if you try the dkgp reconfigure first to see if it works
[07:07] <lucas9000> i'm looking into all those you guys suggested...thanks all and goodnight
[07:07] <compudaze> depends on what u consider decent
[07:08] <nothlit> Noah0504, is you camera under usb mass storage mode?

[07:08] <explorar> anyone have MG 870 USB CDMA modem driver?
[07:08] <Noah0504> nothlit, I'm not sure what you mean...
[07:08] <ZeroSmoke> there's a couple walkthroughs that can help you do it
[07:08] <dustin> compudaze, uh with screen shots
[07:08] <dustin> or other colors
[07:09] <nothlit> Noah0504, well I'm sure someone else will be able to help you, but if you can't get it working you could always try a card reader
[07:09] <BeanBag> ZeroSmoke: Dont laugh, but is dkgp reconfigure a command?
[07:09] <ZeroSmoke> beanbag deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
[07:09] <ZeroSmoke> what the?
[07:09] <nothlit> BeanBag, dpkg-reconfigure with the hyphen is a command, but you have to put sudo before that

[07:14] <BeanBag> nothlit: Im trying to change my resolution... its too high and its hurting my eyes...
[07:14] <nothlit> Noah0504, you can try manually mounting it, it sounds like something is already trying to talk to it, maybe try resetting
[07:14] <ZeroSmoke> suggested going through reconfigure before editing xorg
[07:14] <nothlit> BeanBag, the resolution tool in System-> Preferences doesn't work?
[07:14] <defrysk> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the way to go
[07:15] <BeanBag> nothlit: nope, when i change it there it throws me to the login screen and then after i logged in, the resolution is the same
[07:15] <ZeroSmoke> did you hit control alt backspace?
[07:16] <BeanBag>  ZeroSmoke: Why?
[07:16] <nothlit> BeanBag, well then yeah try reconfiguring xorg with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg like zero and beanbag said
[07:16] <Tompu> BeanBag: kills X server
[07:16] <ZeroSmoke> if i'm correct that resets the x server
[07:16] <Packeteer> guys, i'm trying to run dapper on my server but i need a newer kernel to support my hardware... are there newer kernels in a repository or should i make my own?
[07:16] <BeanBag>  ZeroSmoke: im an idiot...
[07:16] <Tompu> ZeroSmoke: it kills the server. any resetting happens because of something else, such as GDM
[07:16] <BeanBag>  ZeroSmoke: but im learning
[07:16] <crimsun> Packeteer: the latter, but realise we won't support your kernel issues after that.

[07:23] <Bonez56> hi all, i have an edgy system that I have full ssh access to. It's my home PC at home and I want to enable the VNC server so I can connect in from a remote location. I usually just use the one on Preferences/Remote Desktop - is there a config file for this ,or a way to enable it without having to physically be at the PC?
[07:26] <ZeroSmoke> that would be nice...
[07:26] <neobonzi> are there any experienced peeps out there that can help me get my stupid Intel wireless card to work on my laptop?
[07:27] <sethk> Bonez56, you can ssh into it?
[07:27] <atrus> Bonez56: x11vnc will let you start a vnc server and attach it to an existing X session. /usr/lib/vino/vino-server is the regular gnome vnc server, configured via vino-preferences (if you've got X forwarding running)
[07:28] <ZeroSmoke> the thing is Leaving computer with an unattended GNOME login session is not secure
[07:28] <nol13> neobonzi: im no expert, but im just gonna take a shot in the dark and say try setting it up with ndiswrapper
[07:29] <neobonzi> nol13, how do i do that? Im SUCH a noob
[07:29] <nothlit> Bonez56, or you can install realvnc and use x0vncserver
[07:29] <nol13> what card is it?
[07:29] <neobonzi> Intel  Pro Wireless 3945ABG
[07:29] <acidtonic> question, I noticed in edgy the networking configuration has a new option "Scan for available services and advertise blah blah"
[07:29] <acidtonic> exactly what does that do?
[07:29] <acidtonic> and why doesnt it have a help topic in the help section?
[07:30] <BHSPitLappy> neobonzi, go into System>Administration>Networking (from the menu), and see if it's there at all
[07:30] <nothlit> something unsafe and gnomes documentation is ... lacking
[07:30] <neobonzi> i turned it off because i followed a guide that enabled Gnome-networking

[07:31] <BHSPitLappy> neobonzi, uhh, what?
[07:31] <Bonez56> HUN-MANT-LASR1
[07:31] <BHSPitLappy> neobonzi, in what sense did you "turn it off", and to what are you referring
[07:31] <acidtonic> I read that its unsafe, but I'm a CISSP and I'd like to make an informed decision as to whether or not my company will use this "feature"
[07:31] <neobonzi> I went into a configure file and commented out a bunch of devices
[07:31] <acidtonic> I'd at least like to know whats going on under the hood :)
[07:32] <neobonzi> except for the loopback one
[07:32] <neobonzi> ill try to find the guide i know i dont make any sense
[07:32] <acidtonic> nothlit, you mention unsafe, how so?
[07:32] <BHSPitLappy> neobonzi, that sounds dumb and unnecessary... what howto was this?

[07:34] <nol13> neobonzi: see if this helps http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-107947.html, for steps 1-5 you should be able to just do a "sudo apt-get ndiswrapper-utils"

[07:52] <nol13> neobonzi: this might be the driver you need for ndiswrapper http://www.opendrivers.com/freedownload/232625/intel-pro-wireless-3945abg-driver---software-10.1.0.3-windows-2000-xp-download.html
[07:52] <BHSPitLappy> docgnome`, just backup your home folder (including hidden directories)
[07:52] <Tompu> docgnome`: specifically, you want the .gnome, .gnome2 etc directories
[07:52] <unikuser> docgnome: configs are stored in hidden dires .gtk*  .gnome ...

[07:52] <docgnome`> My other question is why is the ubuntu wiki using https instead of http?
[07:53] <nol13> neobonzi: here http://download.opendrivers.com/drv/network/intel/WLAN_Generic_SW_2200BG_2915ABG_3945ABG_V10.1.0.3_TIC_107948.zip
[07:53] <crimsun> docgnome`: because it's good practice
[07:53] <Tompu> docgnome`: anti spam measure?
[07:53] <Bonez56> how do I enable VNC
[07:54] <GNeu> unikuser, what's wrong with ctrl + alt + D?
[07:54] <neobonzi> nol13: Awesome! that looks like it. Thanks a lot
[07:54] <`axion> how can i disable startup notification in GNOME? the icons on my desktop give me a wait cursor for a very long time after they load
[07:54] <unikuser> actually I want to map musc shortcuts like win+c win+b .....
[07:54] <unikuser> ctrl+alt+d is fine
[07:55] <jordan_> #ubuntu-xgl
[07:55] <poningru> unikuser: system->preferences->keyboard shortcut
[07:55] <unikuser> moreover I can press win+d with one hand where as I have to press ctrl+alt+d with both hands.
[07:55] <Bonez56> how to eat poo
[07:55] <GNeu> unikuser, there should be something under /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/
[07:55] <nol13> neobonzi: good luck
[07:55] <GNeu> unikuser, in gconf
[07:56] <unikuser> tried system->preferences->keyboard shortcut and chenged it. it took sth like <super><meta>w. but it is not working.
[07:57] <randomi> Hey I read a few months back about joining xfs partitions without using LVM... does anyone know how to do that? I can't find the link anymore
[07:57] <Bonez56> gawawawa
[07:57] <GNeu> unikuser, you should just be able to use <Super>d, I think
[07:58] <kamui> crap, I might just be better off finding a place to copy the current 180 gigs it has and reformatting to fat32
[07:58] <neobonzi> BHSPitLappy: sorry i missed your question before. It is supposed to be recognized standard but i think i screwed it up by messing with it - it wasnt picking up any wireless networks
[07:58] <kamui> is there a way to resize an ntfs partition inside of linux?

[07:59] <ZeroSmoke> .
[07:59] <ZeroSmoke> oops
[07:59] <unikuser> <super>d  is working when I edit in gconf. but, how can I change it for music shortcuts which I cant find in gconf?

[08:00] <clearzen> I'm trying to make my own router out of a old computer. I have the wlan and lan interfaces working. However I have a optional interface that I can not see within my internal network. Can anyone help me?
[08:00] <traskbt> I have a .iso of a GNU/Linux distro downloaded, but no blank CD-Rs, only CD-RWs is there a way I can still install the new distro? (i'm on ubuntu right now)
=== jordan_ is now known as Jordan_U
[08:01] <unikuser> system->preferences->keyboard shortcut  is not taking it as super and is taking it as <mod4><hyper>d  which is the reason I think it is not working.
[08:01] <Tompu> traskbt: multiple methods
[08:01] <unikuser> clearzen: ifconfig -a
[08:02] <Tompu> traskbt: multiple cd/dvd drives?
[08:02] <GNeu> unikuser, /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/music
[08:02] <traskbt> Nope, just the one DVD/CD-R/W
[08:02] <Tompu> traskbt: oh. i also just reread what you said. you can install from CD-RW
[08:02] <traskbt> It fails to load completely.
[08:02] <GNeu> unikuser, and the rest are in the same directory in gconf
[08:03] <Tompu> traskbt: but the cd is detected and starts to boot?
[08:03] <traskbt> When I put the CD-RW in(after burning the .iso to it correctly) and reboot it sits at a shell prompt for a while and then says boot failed
=== Tomcat_` is now known as Tomcat_
[08:03] <traskbt> Er, not really a shell prompt, but a console.
[08:04] <Tompu> traskbt: what distro and arch is that?
[08:04] <clearzen> unikuser: one sec I have to run back to my server.
[08:04] <traskbt> That I'm trying to install, or that I'm on?
[08:04] <Tompu> traskbt: whats on the cd
[08:04] <traskbt> gNewSense.
[08:05] <Tompu> traskbt: x86? x86_64?
[08:05] <traskbt> x86
[08:05] <poningru> those of you who are in the US GO OUT AND VOTE tomorrow
[08:05] <Tompu> traskbt: id try rewriting the image to another cd before i did anything else
[08:06] <traskbt> Alrighty.
[08:06] <Tompu> traskbt: when/if that doesnt work, i'd copy the contents onto a partition that wont be overwritten during your install
[08:06] <Tompu> traskbt: then you need a working live cd
[08:06] <traskbt> poningru, I've been telling everyone I know(that can vote) that, but noone listens, damnit.
[08:07] <traskbt> Tompu, alright, thanks, I'll try burning it again now.....
[08:07] <mreynolds> Hey all.  Sort of a weird question, but I'm trying to setup a personal dialin server.  I've used : http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2006/10/effectiveness-of-automated-refactoring.html so far but when I dialin (windows box to my linux box), the modem answers, mgetty starts, but I get a strange error and it fails to connect
[08:07] <Tompu> traskbt: also, take a look at debootstrap
[08:07] <GNeu> poningru, traskbt, #off-topic
[08:07] <mreynolds> Anyone here familiar with mgetty/dial-in enough to take a look?
[08:07] <poningru> ...
[08:08] <Jordan_U> traskbt: You can also install from a flash dirve if needed: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
[08:08] <traskbt> Eh, haven't got a flash drive \
[08:08] <traskbt> :\*
[08:09] <traskbt> Hm, Tompu, I don't feel like waiting for 20 minutes to see if a burn worked, how do I go about installing from a LiveCD?
[08:09] <GNeu> mreynolds, I really thought that no one ever used any of those dail-in packages. But sorry haven't got the faintest clue about dail-ins. What's the error?
[08:09] <fluvvell> mreynolds, are you setting up a ppp session? what authentication have you chosen?
[08:09] <mreynolds> GNeu: Grabbing it from the logs... and I didn't use a package, per-se.
[08:09] <Sutur> I have a 20GB disk with 3 partitions, 8GB ext3, 1.85GB swap & 9.32GB fat32. They are in that order in gparted, is it possible to merge the first and last partition after converting from fat32 to ext3?

[08:10] <mreynolds> fluvvell: pap, not chap, and yeah, ppp
[08:10] <mreynolds> GNeu: thanks for the help
[08:11] <GNeu> mreynolds, did nothing :)
[08:11] <PMG-> hi all
[08:11] <mreynolds> GNeu: I remember #debian, you answered nicely, that's something ;)
[08:11] <Jordan_U> !hi | PMG-
[08:11] <ubotu> PMG-: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:11] <fluvvell> mreynolds, Sheesh its ages since ive done this stuff, are you following any particular howtos?
[08:11] <PMG-> long time user, first time channel user
[08:11] <PMG-> sup
[08:11] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Yup, pasted it above, repaste is http://derrick-caluag.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-to-setup-dial-in-server-on-linux.html
[08:11] <GNeu> unikuser, your c key isn't working?
[08:12] <PMG-> so anyone know how to automatically see wireless access points in the area on edgy
[08:12] <unikuser> now. if I press c it is taking for that.
[08:12] <PMG-> i'm using WifiRadar
[08:12] <PMG-> which seems to be doing the trick
[08:12] <unikuser> i'm restarting gnome. this happened to me many times.
[08:12] <FunnyLookinHat> PMG-, try using network-manager   : )  it's great for wireless
[08:12] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Followed it to the letter multiple times, although it says nothing about doing this with a windows dial-in client, so I'm a bit lost.  But I realize it's the "ack/req/ack" and somehow the ack isn't being .... recognized?
[08:13] <ZorbaTHut> grrr. why can the ubuntu rescue disk detect my ethernet adapter when my actual installation can't?
[08:13] <neobonzi> can someone help me im stuck on step 6 of this guide http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-107947.html to install my wireless card
[08:13] <PMG-> FunnyLookinHat: thanks
[08:13] <Sutur> I have a 20GB disk with 3 partitions, 8GB ext3, 1.85GB swap & 9.32GB fat32. They are in that order in gparted, is it possible to merge the first and last partition after converting from fat32 to ext3? OR, simply - Is it possible to merge partitions?
[08:13] <GNeu> unikuser, hmm... I wonder why? What does it say is the gconf entry?
[08:13] <traskbt> Can anyone tell me how to install a .iso (linux distro) from a livecd?
[08:13] <phenex> upgrade from dapper to edgy - no sound. i hear my mic, but can't play music or record... any idea what can cause this?
[08:13] <PMG-> uhhh
[08:13] <PMG-> iso?
[08:13] <PMG-> you burn it to CD
[08:13] <GNeu> traskbt, burn it, then boot from it is the usual why.
[08:13] <PMG-> then boot from your CD drive
[08:14] <traskbt> I know how to do that, I have no blanks.
[08:14] <traskbt> >.<
[08:14] <PMG-> lol
[08:14] <PMG-> go to office depot
[08:14] <Tompu> traskbt: this is why you must always repeat your question in its entirety, and not pieces :)
[08:14] <PMG-> bring 5 bucks
[08:14] <PMG-> lol
[08:14] <nol13> neobonzi: if it rekognize ur card b4, u maybe should just forget everything i say
[08:14] <traskbt> PMG- I have no car and no money :P
[08:14] <foo> How can I increase logging to /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages ?
[08:14] <traskbt> Tompu, yeah, I can see that :P
[08:14] <PMG-> ask a friend?
[08:14] <fluvvell> mreynolds, "ack/req/ack" yeah, theres something about passwords and the ms version that you have to be wary of... still reading the blog - looks good sofar
[08:14] <traskbt> It's 1:14
[08:14] <Tompu> traskbt: did you look at debootstrap?
[08:15] <neobonzi> nol13:  maybe i should use this http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/INSTALL ?
[08:15] <Sutur> I have a 20GB disk with 3 partitions, 8GB ext3, 1.85GB swap & 9.32GB fat32. They are in that order in gparted, is it possible to merge the first and last partition after converting from fat32 to ext3? OR, simply - Is it possible to merge partitions?
[08:15] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Yeah, I know there is a trick (remembering from way back when) but I haven't been able to GIMF or anything else.  My google-fu is failing so I figured I'd ask here.
[08:15] <mitrovarr> hey guys, I have an application that's barfing because it wants a 32 bit library and the ones I have are 64 bit.  Any ideas?
[08:15] <GNeu> traskbt, 01:14?
[08:15] <zoople> Hi, i've installed nvidia-glx from the package manager, but when i go "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable", it says: "unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel. (Nvidia Geforce Go 6600)
[08:16] <traskbt> 01:14, yes.
[08:16] <fluvvell> mreynolds, it gets that way ;-)
[08:16] <PMG-> wow
[08:16] <unikuser> GNeu: In gconf entry it is <Super>c , but when I see it in keyboard-shortcuts gui, it shows as c. this happened to me many time. I wonder why.
[08:16] <GNeu> traskbt, go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow
[08:16] <PMG-> this channel is so flooded
[08:16] <PMG-> lol
[08:16] <traskbt> Tompu, what about it?
[08:16] <Sutur> zoople: Did you try editing the xorg config file?
[08:16] <defrysk> zoople, try nvidia-xconfig
[08:16] <zoople> kk

[08:17] <defrysk> zoople, use sudo ;)
[08:17] <nol13> neobonzi: maybe, but if your card was natively supported though you might not have too, when you do "iwconfig wlan0" what does it say?
[08:17] <Sutur> zoopleMake sure you have permission, use sudo...

[08:17] <defrysk> zoople, also stop pasteing
[08:17] <neobonzi> nol13: it says "no suck device"
[08:17] <GNeu> traskbt, if it has survived this long it can last a little longer. Buy some blank cd's, then burn then you can install you new Distro :)

[08:18] <traskbt> GNeu, I won't have any money or a car any time soon, either :|
[08:18] <jirwin> sound does work everywhere else on the computer(just no videos, even with mplayer and totem)
[08:18] <fluvvell> mreynolds, yeah, hah!  I nearly cooked my head trying to get an internal pci modem to work recently...
[08:19] <Tompu> jirwin: have you tried different video formats?
[08:19] <nol13> neobonzi: ok, ndiswrapper or the INSTALL document might be good then, did you download/try installing the driver with ndiswrapper yet?
[08:19] <GNeu> traskbt, then wait till pay day and walk to the shop ;)
[08:19] <mitrovarr> well, I figured it out myself, but if anyone else needs the answer, it's to get ia32-libs
[08:19] <mreynolds> mreynolds: Fortunately (well, sort of) this is a winmodem supported by linuxant, so at least the config was simple enough.
[08:19] <jirwin> Tompu: this is something that just stopped working. It did work just fine 20 minutes ago
[08:19] <mreynolds> er, that was for fluvvell
[08:19] <traskbt> I have no job :\
[08:19] <jirwin> the only thing I changed was setting up dual-heads
[08:20] <jirwin> and to do that I did "sudo aticonfig --initial=dual-head"
[08:20] <neobonzi> nol13: I downloaded the 80mb file and unzipped it, went into the directory, ran the ndiswrapper then ndiswrapper -m
[08:20] <Tompu> jirwin: does that involve multiple x sessions?
[08:20] <jirwin> Tompu: yah
[08:20] <Tompu> jirwin: and are you using OSS?
[08:20] <nol13> what does "ndiswrapper -l" say?
[08:20] <jirwin> i'm not using xinerama if that is what you mean
[08:20] <jirwin> how can I tell if I am using oss?
[08:20] <ZorbaTHut> okay, I don't get this one. When I start off the CD in recovery mode I have internet access ("aptitude update" contacts servers). When I start normally, I don't. dmesg shows eth0 being registered, but ifconfig doesn't list it - just lo. what am I doing wrong here?
[08:20] <Tompu> jirwin: because you're not using alsa ;)
[08:21] <fluvvell> mreynolds, what version of windows is the client end running?
[08:21] <jirwin> alsamixer lets me control my volume
[08:21] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Win 2k
[08:21] <GNeu> unikuser, I trying to find what the hex of the key combo would be, I am just having a google of it so it might take a while
[08:21] <neobonzi> nol13: it says bcmwl5          driver installed
[08:21] <neobonzi> w39n51  invalid driver!
[08:21] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Errrr, xp, pro, sorry
[08:21] <Tompu> jirwin: multiple sound cards?
[08:21] <jirwin> no
[08:21] <defrysk> Tompu, we  all use alsa on ubuntu
[08:21] <iwaterball> GNeu: "xev" may be an easyer way
[08:21] <mreynolds> fluvvell: They get a "closed port error", if that helps at all.  I couldn't make heads or tails of the windows end of it.
[08:21] <neobonzi> inol13: i installed w39n51 from another tutorial that had nothign to do with my problem i think
[08:21] <Tompu> defrysk: i have oss. i have to use it for somethings. oss. i use it.
[08:22] <zerosmoke> neobonzi, what hardware are you dealing with?  is that a wireless card?
[08:22] <Tompu> jirwin: do you have no sound regardless of which 'head' the movie player is on?
[08:22] <neobonzi> zerosmoke, yeah its  a pro wireless 3945ABG
[08:23] <neobonzi> by intel
[08:23] <GNeu> iwaterball, thanks
[08:23] <defrysk> jirwin, you are sure you do not have a build in soundchip in your mobu but using a soundcard instead ?
[08:23] <defrysk> mobo*
[08:24] <jirwin> defrysk: it is a laptop
[08:24] <jirwin> so pretty sure
[08:24] <defrysk> ah i see
[08:24] <defrysk> ok
[08:24] <fluvvell> mreynolds, whats in your options file?
[08:24] <unikuser> GNeu: what I understand from this is that it is working in metacity keybindings,but not in gnome-settings-daemon.
[08:24] <mnepton> neobonzi: that should require no additional work
[08:24] <neobonzi> mneption: Im on edgy - it stopped working when i upgraded
[08:24] <fluvvell> mreynolds, forget that, its probably whats on the blog
[08:24] <mnepton> neobonzi: i'm typing via my 3945abg right now on a stock 3945abg on a t-pad t60 in dapper
[08:25] <mreynolds> fluvvell: well, I'll get it into pastebin to check
[08:25] <neobonzi> mnepton: it worked fine in dapper for me too butwhen i upgraded to edgy it bit the dust
[08:25] <mreynolds> fluvvell: http://pastebin.com/818855
[08:25] <jirwin> Tompu: ok, I move it to the second monitor and it doesn't even play. It dies
[08:25] <mreynolds> fluvvell: I think that's tinkered a bit, since I couldn't get the defaults to work
[08:25] <mnepton> neobonzi: there are reasons i have not switched to Edgy
[08:26] <GNeu> unikuser, from what I understand, gnome-settings... will only accept single key shortcuts for most of the keys
[08:26] <zerosmoke> mnepton, what reasons?
[08:26] <neobonzi> mnepton: edgy works 100% fine for me so far except for this one hicup
[08:26] <jirwin> this error(multiple players give the same error): BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[08:26] <nol13> neobonzi: oh, i dunno then, thats the main reason why i havent upgradded yet, upgrade to dapper broke mine for a minute
[08:26] <neobonzi> nol13: is there any way i can just restore everything to default as far as network connections
[08:26] <chewy> i am having trouble with enlightened gnome on edgy
[08:26] <zipzo> when i try to change to a direcotry that i know exists, i get this   bash: cd: /home/(my name)/.wine/drive_c/Program NO such file or directory
[08:26] <chewy> cannot start session "starte16 GNOME"
[08:26] <GNeu> unikuser, and because when <Super>C was used it only read the last character, it tried to use c as the shortcut
[08:27] <zipzo> when thew file name is Program Files
[08:27] <chewy> i had it working on dapper no problems
[08:27] <Tompu> zipzo try Program\ Files
[08:27] <jirwin> zipzo: you have to escape the space
[08:27] <jirwin> :)
[08:27] <neobonzi> I think its funny how i got beryl to work on edgy but my stupid wireless card doesnt work
[08:27] <chewy> any ideas how to get enlightened gnome working?
[08:27] <zipzo> escape the space..
[08:27] <Tompu> zipzp, put a \ in front of the space..
[08:27] <Tompu> zipzo: even
[08:28] <GNeu> neobonzi, you trying to use ndiswrapper with bcmwl5a on edgy?
[08:28] <nol13> neobonzi: im not the one to ask honestly, also after dapper upgrade i had to replace the firmware of my wireless driver with the old version, maybe its similar
[08:28] <zipzo> still says no
[08:28] <chewy> what do i need to put in /usr/share/xsessions/e-gnome to get enlightened gnome?
[08:28] <Magilla> does anyone know an easy way to read headers from a .deb package?
[08:28] <mareks> is it possible to get someones IP by talking to them over AOL Instant Messenger protocol?
[08:28] <Tompu> zipzo: case sensitivity? use tab completion?
[08:28] <zerosmoke> i'm using motorola wireless card seems to work fine with ubuntu
[08:28] <jirwin> zipzo try this: cd "/home/blah/blah/Program Files"
[08:28] <neobonzi> Gneu: i have no idea what im trying to do. I have a n Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG card in my Dell E1505 laptop. I upgraded to edgy and now i want to make it work
[08:28] <chewy> zipzo just hit tab for auto complete
[08:29] <neobonzi> Gneu: that might be what you said but im an idiot
[08:29] <BHSPitLappy> mareks, not without a direct-connect feature (dc, file transfer, etc)
[08:29] <foo> Is there a way to increase the logging (verbosity) in the system logs in ubuntu?
[08:29] <chewy> ok let me ask this, does anyone have enlightened gnome running on edgy?
[08:29] <BHSPitLappy> foo, don't you get it? It's impossible.
[08:29] <mareks> BHSPitLappy: how certain? (thats what i thought too, but just making sure)
[08:29] <BHSPitLappy> mareks, very
[08:29] <zerosmoke> negative, chewy
[08:30] <mareks> BHSPitLappy: what if they try to initiate DC, will their router log show where its sending request to or something?
[08:30] <jirwin> Tompu: any other ideas?
[08:30] <GNeu> neobonzi, from what I read (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286924) the ndiswrapper packaged with edgy is broken
[08:30] <Tompu> jirwin: nay. i dont have multihead
[08:30] <GNeu> neobonzi, so everyone is having problems
[08:30] <Tompu> jirwin: time to crawl through your logs :p
[08:30] <neobonzi> Gneu: Thats good news i guess?
[08:31] <neobonzi> GNeu: haha thats like a punch to the groin is what that is
[08:31] <jirwin> i didn't realize multihead would kill sound
[08:31] <unikuser> any other way to get the music shortcuts to win keys?
[08:31] <Tompu> jirwin: the first thing id do would be to switch back to 'single head' and see if that fixes the problem
[08:31] <GNeu> neobonzi, the solution seems to go to ndiswrapper.sf.net and make the source yourself. Very painful :'(
[08:32] <tommcd> hello all, first time here
[08:32] <neobonzi> GNeu: im a noob, i dont think i can do that but if its not impossible i would ike to
[08:32] <GNeu> neobonzi, you can do it!
[08:32] <BHSPitLappy> mareks, I don't know, ask in #gaim or something
[08:32] <mreynolds> fluvvell: Well, unfortunately, I have to go plug on this a bit more.  Later.  Thanks for the help.
[08:33] <neobonzi> GNeu: okay Step 1: What does 'making source' mean
[08:33] <GNeu> neobonzi, 1) download source from ndiswrapper.sf.net
[08:33] <neobonzi> GNeu: okay on it
[08:33] <Hobbsee> !ndiswrapper > neobonzi
[08:33] <Hobbsee> !ndiswrapper > GNeu
[08:33] <Tompu> !b-e | neobonzi
[08:33] <ubotu> neobonzi: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[08:34] <Tompu> what does b-e actually mean?
[08:34] <GNeu> Hobbsee, the wifi docs don't seem to mention that ndis. is broken
[08:34] <neobonzi> sweet! automation in IRC! I feel like a computer nerd now :D
[08:34] <Flannel> Tompu: build-essential, b-e is a shortcut
[08:34] <Hobbsee> GNeu: the compiling from source section howto isnt, though.
[08:34] <Hobbsee> neobonzi: yay for bots :)
[08:35] <neobonzi> I have to get my wireless working or i wont have anything to do in class tomorrow :(
[08:35] <Magilla> does anyone know an easy way to read headers from a .deb package? I'd prefer in php, but any interpreted/web language will do...
[08:35] <Madpilot> neobonzi, the bot is generally the smartest critter in this channel ;)
[08:35] <neobonzi> I could believe it
[08:35] <iwaterball> Madpilot: read "man dpkg-deb"
[08:35] <neobonzi> i like irc - it reminds me of hackers with sandra bullok
[08:35] <GNeu> horray for ubotu !
[08:36] <jirwin> Tompu: yup, going back to single-head fixed it.
[08:36] <iwaterball> Magilla: read "man dpkg-deb" <- wrong tabbing, sorry
[08:36] <Madpilot> iwaterball, what?
[08:36] <iwaterball> Madpilot: sorry, one tab-press too many...
[08:36] <jirwin> neobonzi: hackers had angelina jolie
[08:36] <Madpilot> iwaterball, np, been there, done that
[08:36] <Magilla> thanks iwaterball
[08:36] <jirwin> and sandra bullock was in the net
[08:36] <neobonzi> jirwin: whatever the movie sucked anyways
[08:37] <GNeu> I think this is an #off-topic :)
[08:37] <zerosmoke> kind of unrealistic
[08:37] <jirwin> Tompu: so, how would I change to OSS?
[08:37] <zerosmoke> you can watch it on desync on shoutcast tv
[08:37] <neobonzi> yeah man, can't you guys see im trying to compile something from source or something
[08:37] <zerosmoke> every night
[08:37] <Tompu> jirwin: dont. it'd be worse. so much worse. you'll cry and curse my name
[08:37] <jirwin> oh
[08:37] <Tompu> jirwin: i was going to blame your problem on it
[08:37] <jirwin> Tompu: any ideas on how to fix it then?
[08:38] <jirwin> oh ha
[08:38] <Magilla> iwaterball: how about on a system where dpkg-deb isn't available?
[08:39] <jirwin> Magilla: then it probably isn't ubuntu, so you would have to ask someone else ;)
[08:39] <neobonzi> if im trying to compile ndiswrapper and install it do i need to uninstall the one i installed with synaptic
[08:39] <Magilla> any idea who?
[08:40] <iwaterball> Magilla: don't mess with deb files on such systems? :P you can probably file some docs on the deb format in debian.org, essentially its a tar.gz file with some speical files inside
[08:40] <GNeu> neobonzi, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#head-c1ebf95637d110c5f01b9a1383d137f79d8cbddb is what you need to be looking at
[08:40] <neobonzi> kk
[08:40] <iwaterball> Magilla: i.e. find
[08:40] <GNeu> neobonzi, that should guide you through it better than I can
[08:40] <neobonzi> ACK! so many windows open! Welcome to linux - right?
[08:40] <jirwin> so many windows?
[08:41] <neobonzi> Gneu: thanks a lot! here i go
[08:41] <Magilla> iwaterball: I don't need to install them on another system, I'm just trying to document contents
[08:41] <Magilla> I'll try #debian
[08:41] <neobonzi> I'm a FOB from windows - i dont used more than one desktop yet
[08:41] <jirwin> ahh. you should. It is nice.
[08:41] <GNeu> neobonzi, you have workspaces, <ctrl><alt>Left/Right/Up/Down to change workspace
[08:41] <WikinG> i have problems with sound in 90% tgames &
[08:41] <iwaterball> Magilla: afaik its easy to install dpkg-* from source on any system, just like its easy to install zip or rar
[08:42] <neobonzi> i have beryl installed so when i do that the 3d cube flys around - it scares me
[08:42] <Magilla> iwaterball: It's not my server, and I doubt the admin would do it for me
[08:42] <WikinG> i have problems with sound in 90% games & apps. what problem can it be?
[08:43] <iwaterball> Magilla: there will probably be a lib you can use on cpan or pear
[08:43] <overrider> what can happen when i use photo paper (which says do not use it on a laser printer) with a laser printer?
[08:43] <iceman> hie guys! for soe reason,i just lost sound on my computer,and its not a hardware problem! how can i get it back? am using (ubuntu dapper)
[08:43] <iceman> hie guys! for some reason,i just lost sound on my computer,and its not a hardware problem! how can i get it back? am using (ubuntu dapper)
[08:43] <Lathiat> overrider: problem is lasers get very hot and the photo paper often has laminate, etc, it'l likely melt and ruin the durm on your laser, bad idea, dont do it :)
[08:44] <defrysk> overrider, gest dusty then ?
[08:44] <Lathiat> iceman: have you checked the volume control?
[08:44] <defrysk> gets*
[08:44] <iwaterball> Magilla: http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/DPKG-Parse
[08:44] <neobonzi> GNeu: how long does it take before i can start writing these guides instead of blindly typing them into my console
[08:44] <defrysk> overrider, try it and inform us ;p
[08:44] <iceman> yes! and i cant access it.
[08:45] <GNeu> neobonzi, not too long, you'll pick most of them up pretty quickly
[08:45] <Magilla> thanks iwaterball
[08:45] <jirwin> Tompu: maybe xinerama is the solution
[08:47] <overrider> defrysk, lol i was going to...but the part about the laminating makes sense
[08:47] <Mantice> Hmmm Why was Xchat not included in dapper ?
[08:47] <Tompu> jirwin: perhaps. i know nothing about your problem. the logs should guide you though. believe in the logs. trust the logs. etc.
[08:47] <Madpilot> Mantice, supposedly Gaim is good enough at IRC. The fact that it actually sucks for IRC was apparently ignored. :|
[08:48] <Mantice> hahaha
[08:48] <Mantice> Hey I remember you Madpilot
[08:48] <larsmc> er irc.greekirc.net
[08:48] <Mantice> You helped me out alot thanks.
[08:48] <WikinG> i have problems with sound in 90% games & apps. what problem it can be?
[08:48] <neobonzi> GNeu, Okay i got stuck - im on part 4.4 that says building deb packages, its not letting me do it int he terminal
[08:49] <Mantice> I was the one with Ubuntu 64 bit with Ati drivers :(
[08:49] <mnepton> X-Caht was not included, IIRC, because of UI changes and space constraints
[08:49] <Madpilot> Mantice, ah, I remember. Did you reinstall w/ the 32 bit OS?
[08:49] <Mantice> Yeah
[08:49] <Mantice> I just installed ubuntu 4 min ago.
[08:49] <GNeu> neobonzi, did you read the note, you shouldn't need to do that
[08:49] <Mantice> They sent me the disks all nice and shiney along with stickers
[08:49] <neobonzi> is it already installed by the time i get there?
[08:50] <zerosmoke> anyone else get stuck on anthy when doing the getapt install?
[08:50] <zerosmoke> for xubuntu?
[08:50] <Mantice> Whats the NTFS auto mount command ?
[08:50] <neobonzi> Gneu, nvm man im stupid i found it
[08:50] <neobonzi> GNeu, im not too fond of reading
[08:51] <Tompu> Mantice: how long did it take?
[08:51] <Cyber_Stalker> lol
[08:51] <Tompu> Mantice: to receive the cds
[08:51] <Cyber_Stalker> neobonzi, linux = LOTS of reading
[08:51] <Mantice> A couple of weeks, not long.
[08:51] <Packeteer> guys, is there a guide to updating the kernel on the install cd?
[08:51] <Mantice> I think it was worth it because they did a good job packaging it.
[08:52] <Mantice> I gave some disks to my friends
[08:52] <neobonzi> Cyber_Stalker, do they make cliffnotes for linux? Thats how i get through my english classes :D
[08:52] <chewy> how can i make it so that i can pass an option in ~/xsessions/e-gnome
[08:52] <unikuser> GNeu: What I got in conclusion is that music shortcuts  are not working for me in total.What ever key I give for that will stop working. (Tried <ctrl><alt>b, b stopped working)
[08:52] <chewy> whats happening is that xorg is interpreting starte16 GNOME as a full command
[08:52] <Mantice> Is Edgy beta ???
[08:52] <defrysk> Mantice, yes
[08:53] <chewy> when what i want to do is "starte16" with the GNOME option
[08:53] <Mantice> Cool, Im not going that way just yet.
[08:53] <GNeu> unikuser, from what I understand, gnome-settings... will only accept single key shortcuts for most of the keys
[08:53] <GNeu> unikuser, and because when <Super>C was used it only read the last character, it tried to use c as the shortcut
[08:53] <unikuser> okey
[08:53] <defrysk> Mantice, its stable
[08:53] <Mantice> Is Beryl Still broken for the lastest kernal ???
[08:53] <defrysk> yes
[08:54] <Mantice> Awww.
[08:54] <GNeu> unikuser, I think, there is probably some workaround
[08:54] <chewy> anyone know anything about ~/xsessions/* files?
[08:54] <unikuser> what do u want in  ~/xsessions/
[08:54] <iwaterball> chewy: what do you want to know?
[08:54] <Mantice> Whats the Kernal update called in the Software Updates ?
[08:55] <anandk> I just upgraded to edgy and my fan keeps activating/deactivating every 20 seconds...  I tried lm-sensors as suggested on FAQ, but it doesn't seem to detect any sensors.  any suggestions?
[08:55] <chewy> iwaterball, i want to do "starte16" with the "GNOME" option
[08:55] <mnepton> Mantice: Edgy is not beta, it is a full release. but it has a lot of experimental stuff, and should only be used by those willing to live on the bleeding edge and pick scabs.
[08:55] <chewy> iwaterball: instead of exec="starte16 GNOME" as a full command
[08:55] <Mantice> Hmmm thats a nice way to put it.
[08:56] <unikuser> Is there any keyboard shortcut to paste X-primary buffer in gnome?
[08:56] <GNeu> Mantice, fairly large scabs
[08:56] <mnepton> Mantice: that's why they hired me ;)
[08:56] <fyre|work> unikuser: ctrl+v or middle click
[08:56] <chewy> iwaterball: which is why it doesn't work, there is no file in /usr/bin named "starte16 GNOME
[08:56] <chewy> "
[08:56] <Mantice> hahahha
[08:56] <Mantice> You work for Ubuntu team ???
[08:56] <unikuser> ctrl+v is from clipboard. not primary buffer. i want a shortcut for middle click thingy
[08:56] <mnepton> Mantice: i work for Canonical.
[08:57] <Mantice> Lucky :)
[08:57] <chewy> iwaterball: so my generic question is, how do i pass arguments to a command in ~/xessions/* so that "exec=command" can take an argument
[08:58] <mnepton> Mantice: it's 2300 and i still have 2 more hours of work in front of me, and a full day at the developers summit starting at 0900. not exactly "lucky" ;)
[08:58] <anandk> Looks like I should just revert to dapper until Edgy gets cleaned up a bit, then :)
[08:58] <iwaterball> chewy: I'm sorry whiche desktop env are we talking here? I'm too far away from my ubuntu machine to look into things at that level I'm afraid
[08:58] <chewy> iwaterball edgy, x86
[08:58] <chewy> gnome
[08:58] <Mantice> You love your job though right ?
[08:58] <chewy> with the e16 window manager
[08:58] <GNeu> anandk, what's the problem
[08:58] <iwaterball> chewy: my guess would be that you have some kind of syntax like params="..."
[08:58] <mnepton> Mantice: i love my girlfriend. she loves a roof and food. you do the math. :)
[08:59] <Mantice> Hahahah :)
[08:59] <Tompu> mnepton: roof _and_ food? spoilt woman
[08:59] <Mantice> lol...
[08:59] <iwaterball> chewy: another solution would be to write a script and have exec=... point to it
[08:59] <Mantice> Tompu does not get along with the girls :)
[08:59] <mnepton> Tompu: and i didn't even mention her AMD64 and car
[08:59] <neobonzi> OH MY GOSH!!!!!
[08:59] <neobonzi> My wireless card WORKS
[08:59] <anandk> GNeu: my fan keeps activating and deactivating every few seconds, and sensors-detect isn't finding much
[08:59] <GNeu> horray!
[09:00] <neobonzi> HOORAH!
[09:00] <Tompu> !off-topic
[09:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about off-topic - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:00] <Tompu> stupid ubotu. i hate you.
[09:00] <Mantice> 250 mb of updates gosh. Some people been doing alot of work.
[09:00] <GNeu> anandk, so you don't get any signs of it, or any sensors
[09:01] <H0110Wman> Tompu : lol
[09:01] <cge> !offtopic
[09:01] <chewy> iwaterball: iwaterball good idea, id much rather do it directly in the config file though
[09:01] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:01] <anandk> sudo sensors-detect goes all the way through and tells me it hasn't found any sensors
[09:01] <cge> Tompu: Don't use the -
[09:01] <chewy> iwaterball: what would the syntax be to pass an argument in "exec=command"
[09:01] <Mantice> Should I stay away from linux-386 Version 2.6.15.25 If I want to use beryl ?
[09:02] <Momal> http://kubuntu.pastebin.ca/242442 <-- anyone had problems running vmware-player on edgy ?
[09:02] <GNeu> anandk, hmmm
[09:02] <chewy> iwaterball: in an ~/xsessions/generic-desktop file
[09:02] <anandk> "Sorry, no chips were detected.  Either your sensors are not supported, or they are connected to an I2C bus adapter we do not support..."
[09:02] <chewy> iwaterball: i'll brb, i tried putting "exec=starte16 -GNOME" with a -
[09:03] <anandk> GNeu, is there any other way to control my fan in edgy?
[09:03] <chewy> iwaterball: my next step will be putting parenteses around each of them, if its written in C mabie that will get it to read them as seperate strings
[09:03] <iceman> guys: my computer keeps saying "can not find audio drivers" but i had sound yesterday! any solution?
[09:03] <Mantice> How do I mount all NTFS drives again ?
[09:03] <Za1> Hi, I am using Ubuntu 6.06 LTS on my laptop.  How can I play wmv format file?
[09:03] <iwaterball> chewy: its probably a bash script thats somewhere in /etc/X11 thats parsing those
[09:04] <neobonzi> im back! hurrah
[09:04] <zoople> for some reason, when i try to view anything with FLASH in it, Firefox closes? I installed the plugin from synaptic pm
[09:04] <GNeu> anandk, sorry I have to go, sorry to leave you on a cliff hanger, good luck
[09:04] <anandk> GNeu: :)  ok, thanks anyway
[09:04] <Za1> How can I play wmv format file?
[09:05] <neobonzi> Gneu: Thanks from me too!
[09:05] <genericuser> Za1: add/remove applicatioons
[09:05] <genericuser> applications
[09:06] <Za1> then what?
[09:06] <anandk> Zal: I believe you want an application called mplayer
[09:07] <anandk> Zal: it is a multipurpose media player that plays wmv and other media files.  look for it in synaptic package manager -- do you know how to do that?
[09:07] <neobonzi> does anyone know why my wireless card isnt showing up in network settings?
[09:07] <Mantice> I right click on my NTFS drive and I get error: device /dev/sda1 is not removable
[09:07] <Mantice> error: could not execute pmount
[09:08] <KenSentMe> I try to play a radio stream with Totem or VLC, but i can't get it to work. Any ideas on how to play this stream: mms://wm7.xs4all.nl/streamgate42=.asx ?
[09:08] <zerosmoke> neobonzi, in microsoft network wireless app or in the client app?
[09:09] <anandk> KenSentMe: did you try Rhythmbox?
[09:09] <neobonzi> zerosmoke, in administration in ubuntu
[09:09] <KenSentMe> anandk: yeah, but it comes with an error if i add this stream to the radiostations
[09:10] <mist> just set up ubuntu for the first time, anyone have an idea why im not able to get an IP address when my network card is active?
[09:10] <KenSentMe> anandk: does it work with you?
[09:10] <zerosmoke> duhh...sorry, was somewhere else on that question...

[09:11] <paolo> Hi. some days ago I installed (apt-get) Glade version 2.12.1 from universe. Hi...Yesterday I updated my packet list on adept (on another pc) and noticed the actual available version of Glade on universe is 2.12.0 (downgrade?). In addition, if I try to install it it says: BREAK (it has a conflict with dependencies). what does it mean? thnks
[09:11] <Mantice> How do you mount NTFS drives in Ubuntu ?
[09:11] <iami89> what your prob?
[09:11] <neobonzi> zerosmoke, haha
[09:11] <neobonzi> Im so confuuuuused

[09:12] <BeanBag> how do i play games in linux? Wine or Cedega?
[09:12] <anandk> KenSentMe: so you get the problem in any media player you try
[09:12] <iami89> <paolo>  use your install cd to fix it
[09:13] <neobonzi> can someone tell me how i can get my network card to work - its sitting in the device manager /w drivers ready to go
[09:13] <mist> Can anyone help me get my network card to pull an IP? it is getting an IP fine in windows (so i know my setup should work correctly)
[09:13] <neobonzi> Beanbag, i use wine for a lot of games, works great
[09:13] <paolo> iami, I don't have the install cd at moment
[09:13] <iwaterball> BeanBag: depends on the game, if you really only want to play games with your PC use windows, really
[09:13] <paolo> is there another way?
[09:13] <iami89> so, download and brun one
[09:13] <BeanBag> neobonzi: is wine available for 64bit?
[09:14] <paolo> iami, but what does it mean?
[09:14] <iami89> <paolo> are you connect internet
[09:14] <neobonzi> Beanbag: i dont think so - i use 32 bit. you can check it out tho
[09:14] <paolo> yes, iami
[09:14] <Za1> how can I download mplayer?
[09:14] <paolo> but I would like to understand what it means....
[09:15] <Jewfro-Macabbi> apt-get mplayer
[09:15] <Za1> it's not in the package manager list
[09:15] <iami89> use rthy...{i forgot it name^_^!} and fix it
[09:15] <Mantice> some one told me fuse is safe is this true ? any one had problems with it ???
[09:15] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Zal, system, software properties, add all repositories first
[09:15] <paolo> iami ok, but please explain what kind of error it is:)
[09:15] <BeanBag> are there any music dj programs available for ubuntu?
[09:16] <zerosmoke> there's one like winamp i heard but forgot the name of it
[09:16] <iami89> its file or module broke
=== zoople is now known as Flash-Problems
[09:16] <paolo> ok... I can't find anything with "rthy"
[09:16] <paolo> so, I need the correct name
[09:16] <iami89> it need fix by reinstall new one
[09:16] <Flash-Problems> Any suggestions for my problem regarding firefox closing due to flash?
[09:17] <iami89> wait
[09:17] <paolo> ok thanks
[09:17] <zerosmoke> yeah i ran into something earlier but haven't gotten it back yet about flash
[09:17] <crimsun> Flash-Problems: known Flash problem. Nothing we can really do at the moment. Are you experiencing these symptoms with both 7.0.68 and 9 beta?
[09:18] <Flash-Problems> i just tried to get the only version that came with package manager
[09:18] <crimsun> Flash-Problems: remove that version and try manually installing 9 beta

[09:42] <chuckyp> cyber, cd /etc   then nano ircd  its probably a text file not a directory.

[09:48] <mnepton> Sutur: no idea. i haven't touched Windows in almost 10 years.
[09:48] <mist> tarzeau: not sure, ill check it out
[09:48] <mist> thanks
[09:48] <Mantice> Can some one look at this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30513/
[09:48] <cyber> thanks mnepton, but is that the only way around it?
[09:48] <Sutur> This doesn't make any logical sense.
[09:48] <newbie> yup..done..firefox no longer crashing
[09:49] <mnepton> Mantice: what are you trying to do?
[09:49] <newbie> Jewfro-Macabbi: now what?
[09:49] <Mantice> On the ubuntu wiki it gave me a list of these codecs to install.
[09:49] <mnepton> Sutur: nothing Microsoft touches "makes any logical sense"
[09:49] <Jewfro-Macabbi> newbie, dunno what to tell you about making flash actually work, but at least firefox works :)
[09:49] <mnepton> Mantice: what are you trying to do?
[09:49] <Mantice> so I ticked all the boxes in the repo and search them using Synaptic
[09:50] <newbie> hehehe ok ya. i guess that will do for now
[09:50] <Mantice> Play mp3 files.
[09:50] <mnepton> Mantice: sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3

[09:51] <Mantice> I went there.
[09:51] <mnepton> Mantice: just type what i wrote into a terminal
[09:52] <Mantice> I was trying to use that package manger.
[09:52] <mnepton> Mantice: when it's done, any gstreamer-aware app (Totem, Rhythmbox) will play mp3 files
[09:52] <ailean> apparently the commercial repo isn't there yet: can I use the commercial repo from dapper on edgy?
[09:53] <detectiveinspekt> gnome-cups-icon was using 100% cpu usage, will this be a cups specific problem?
[09:53] <detectiveinspekt> or usb?
[09:53] <ailean> Mantice, look for "Songbird".  It's a new program that's still in the development stages, but it's a great media player/internet browser
[09:53] <Sutur> mnepton: Something I could have learnt a long time ago.
[09:53] <Za1> can someone pls help me get my projector working.  it's connected to s-video
[09:54] <Sutur> mnepton: I'm in the process of switching all my filesystems from fat32 & ntfs for the LAST damned time.
[09:54] <mnepton> Sutur: smart move :)
[09:54] <Za1> do I need to configure xorg or something to get the setting correctly? pls help
[09:54] <Sutur> mnepton: Thanks. Cya
[09:54] <mnepton> Sutur: use this to access ext3 from Windows - http://fs-driver.org
[09:55] <Sutur> Oh.
[09:55] <Sutur> Okay, thanks :-)
[09:55] <mnepton> np
[09:55] <mnepton> welcome to the real world, NeoSutur ;)
[09:56] <Mantice> Well It seams I manage to install Xvid / DivX on my own some how : )
[09:56] <Mantice> Unless it comes with ubuntu.
[09:56] <mnepton> it does not
[09:56] <mnepton> (we can't legally ship it)
[09:57] <ailean> Please, can someone answer my question?  can I use the commercial repo from dapper on edgy since the edgy one doesn't yet exist?
[09:57] <mist> mnepton: do you know if I have to have nvidia for compiz?
[09:57] <mist> i have an ATI
[09:58] <Za1> can someone pls help me how to setup projector?
[09:58] <Rothbuntu> i use xgl/beryl on my ati
[09:58] <mnepton> mist: you need hardware acceleration, yes
[09:58] <ailean> mist, no, you can use ATI
[09:58] <zerosmoke> clear
[09:58] <mist> thanks
[09:58] <Za1> i am connected to s-video projector on my laptop using Ubunt 6.06
[09:58] <Mantice> Rothbuntu if your using beryl on your computer can you still run games like counterstrike source ?
[09:59] <mnepton> zerosmoke: great, you just erased all my memories
[09:59] <Rothbuntu> ahh not sure  i dont  play many game s
[09:59] <zerosmoke> ?
[09:59] <Rothbuntu> i can play diablo 2
[09:59] <Mantice> I use to play that.
[09:59] <zerosmoke> what?
[09:59] <mnepton> zerosmoke: CLI jockey joke

[10:00] <zerosmoke> i thought i just cleared my screen, not everyone elses
[10:00] <mnepton> zerosmoke: not my screen. my brain.
[10:00] <sn00p> Hello I have a micro sd drive that i'm trying to use on my laptop my laptop is amd64 turion x2 and the micro doesn't seem to automount when I plug it in anybody help?
[10:01] <zerosmoke> :S
[10:01] <chuckyp> sn00p, is it usb?
[10:01] <SyberMile> sup ppl?
[10:01] <sn00p> chuckyp, no I got a hp so the slot is right in the laptop
[10:01] <sarah> does anyone know how to check if Edgy properly recognized my dual cores?
[10:01] <Mantice> what does sudo apt-get update do ?
[10:02] <Mantice> Dont worry I think I know.
[10:02] <chuckyp> sn00p, hrm... possibly search for your model of hp on the forums.  See if anyone else had similiar problems.
[10:02] <mnepton> Mantice: updates the lists of available software
[10:02] <mnepton> sarah: uname -a
[10:02] <chuckyp> Mantice, it doesn't install anything if thats what you are hinting at it just checks what is avialible and updates the list.
[10:03] <cyber> chuckyp, how would i restart a process thats running in the background?
[10:03] <sarah> mnepton: it gives Linux mybox 2.6.17-10-386 #2 Fri Oct 13 18:41:40 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[10:03] <ailean> cyber, Alt+F2, then type the command
[10:03] <Mantice> Does it check the repositrys ?
[10:03] <cyber> ailean, what if i dont know what the command is :P
[10:03] <mnepton> sarah: you're using the 686 kernel, so yes
[10:03] <ailean> cyber, then u need to find out :)  what was it to do?
[10:04] <wickedpuppy> cyber, what program ? can give an example ?
[10:04] <mnepton> cyber: sudo kill -NOHUP $PID
[10:04] <sarah> thanks mnepton.  actually I'm trying to activate cpu frequency scaling, both cpu keep running in the 110F range when I'm not doing anything
[10:04] <cyber> ill research it :/
[10:05] <sarah> it only happened when I upgraded to edgy, so I guessed that there was a problem with dual core recognition in the new kernel
[10:05] <mnepton> sarah: or stepping
[10:05] <curley_sue> can anyone explain howcome i have SMP while having one processor? (uname output: Linux 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 18:45:35 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux)
[10:05] <Mantice> im sleepy lets see if I can install ati drivers first time with out reconfigering xorg
[10:06] <variant> curley_sue: the default kernel in edgy has support for SMP for those that have it
[10:06] <ailean> curley_sue, what is your processor?
[10:06] <Mantice> !ati
[10:06] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:06] <sarah> mnepton: know anything about how to activate cpu frequency scaling?
[10:06] <variant> curley_sue: there is not a seperate SMP kernel any more to cut down on developer workload (and there is not much difference in performance)
[10:06] <mnepton> sarah: not off the top of my head
[10:06] <davro> cyber, look into /etc/init.d/process-name start|stop|restart
[10:06] <luna-nera> ciao
[10:07] <lastnode> sarah, depends on your machine. is it a notebook?
[10:07] <mnepton> variant: i have been whining at Ben about that this week
[10:07] <lastnode> sarah, the laptop testing team has a page for each model, and there are tips on those pages
[10:07] <cyber> hmm
[10:07] <luna-nera> va be ciao
[10:07] <mnepton> (and he just cleaned my clock in Texas Hold'Em)
[10:07] <sarah> yes, it's a notebook, HPdv2000.  I'll take a look at the laptop testing page
[10:08] <curley_sue> ailean, cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor output: processor	: 0 model name	: Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1.70GHz
[10:08] <HeathenDan> is there a way to return my xorg config back to default?
[10:08] <curley_sue> variant: thank you....
[10:08] <variant> mnepton: the option is there to recompile the kernel your self, if your that concerned that much about performance then recompiling is the only way to go
[10:08] <sarah> /proc/cpuinfo should return only one CPU even though I'm dual core, right?
[10:08] <ailean> curley_sue, it won't run that in SMP mode, don't worry
[10:08] <variant> sarah: yu[
[10:08] <lastnode> sarah, im not sure about that. what does gkrellm return, for example?
[10:08] <Mantice> I have a ATi Radon 9600 XT Pro and I rember using (fglrx) Driver perfectly before but the wiki not states not to.
[10:08] <variant> sarah: yes*
[10:08] <cyber>  invoke /etc/init.d/ircd-hybrid restart
[10:08] <cyber>  is not the correct syntax
[10:09] <mnepton> variant: my concern is more for end users that want best performance without having to recompile,
[10:09] <cyber> what am i missing :P
[10:09] <variant> sarah: type top, it should have two entries, one for each core
[10:09] <mnepton> cyber: sudo invoke-rc.d etc etc etc
[10:09] <variant> mnepton: try a test your self, the difference is negligable. much better to free up developer time for somthing that is more worth while (fixing bugs)
[10:09] <cyber> whats the rc.d?
[10:09] <lastnode> sarah, closest match to your model is this - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/HPDV1150US , and scaling is untested :(
[10:09] <mnepton> cyber: the correct command name :)
[10:09] <lastnode> sarah, im running a presario here, but it's AMD, and single core at that
[10:10] <lastnode> so sorry, can't help you there
[10:10] <u4ia> Hi there
[10:10] <lastnode> hi u4ia
[10:10] <sarah> hmm, top seems to have only one list given
[10:10] <u4ia> I have a question
[10:10] <u4ia> I am a newbie
[10:10] <lastnode> sarah, edgy, i assume?
[10:10] <curley_sue> variant: thanx
[10:10] <cyber> lol
[10:10] <sarah> lastnode: yes, it's edgy
[10:10] <cyber> now it wont let me reconnect ::?
[10:10] <lastnode> u4ia, go ahead mate
[10:10] <chuckyp> sarah, what type of cpu do you have?
[10:11] <cyber> bastid :P
[10:11] <lastnode> cyber, language please, this channel is family friendly
[10:11] <variant> curley_sue: yw
[10:11] <cyber> sorry
[10:11] <cyber> any way
[10:11] <u4ia> I want to connect to my hdd which has windowsXP and RHEL file systems
[10:11] <sarah> chuckyp: 1.73Ghz dual-core intel 32... believe that's called a yonah?
[10:11] <cyber> im gonna need to go study again :?
[10:11] <chuckyp> sarah, just install linux-image-generic
[10:11] <cyber> linux inbetween exams :/
=== cyber is now known as Cyber_Studyin
[10:11] <chuckyp> sarah, that will get a kernel with smp support and more specific for your cpu
[10:12] <u4ia> using a bootup version on ubuntu 6.10 - how do i do it
[10:12] <lastnode> u4ia, you want to create a new partition?
[10:12] <sarah> chuckyp: ok, I'll check gkrellm and then try switching the kernel
=== Devil3 is now known as Nenad89
[10:13] <mnepton> cyber: the invoke-rc.d command only works with processes with init controls
[10:13] <mnepton> ok, i'm fading. off to bed.
[10:13] <mnepton> nighty kids
[10:13] <lastnode> sarah, edgy no longer has -686,k7-smp etc, everything has been merged in to -generic
[10:13] <lastnode> (iirc)
[10:13] <u4ia> Do I have to - I just want to copy a file over from the RHEL to USB stick
[10:13] <bean> hi, i was running on the wrong time (future) for a while, and now sudo complains that "timestamp is too far in the future". how do i get it working again?
[10:13] <variant> bean: there are a couple of options, 1 wait till the future time has passed
[10:14] <lastnode> u4ia, im sorry, im not getting you at all
[10:14] <sarah> lastnode, I've heard this, but I think something might be wrong with how edgy is handling my dual core, since both of my cpus are running at really high temps
[10:14] <chuckyp> sarah, yeah I'm assuming you are using the default kernel.  That is yoru problem.
[10:14] <variant> bean: 2. touch all files to set the modification time to current time
[10:14] <variant> bean: ignore it
[10:14] <lastnode> sarah, what kernel are you using?
[10:14] <bean> variant, which files do i need 2 touch?
[10:14] <variant> bean: change the system time to the future time
[10:14] <variant> bean: thats option 4
[10:14] <variant> bean: dunno really
[10:14] <bean> variant, no i would want to use proper time
[10:14] <chuckyp> What is a girl doing using irc and ubuntu?
[10:15] <BHSPitLappy> she's really a dude
[10:15] <variant> bean: yeah, change the time to the future time and use ntp-client to gradually fix it
[10:15] <variant> bean: thats the best way
[10:15] <lastnode> regardless, that's for -offtopic
[10:15] <sarah> lastnode: 2.6.17-10-386
[10:15] <variant> bean: sorry, ntpd
[10:15] <chuckyp> Most likely a 300lb dude sitting in prison somewhere.
[10:15] <variant> bean: ntpd is important for avoiding time drift
[10:15] <chuckyp> sarah, yeah you are using the default kernel. Install linux-image-generic and all will be okay.
[10:15] <variant> bean: or clock skew..
[10:15] <sarah> there are some of us who don't use os x :)
[10:15] <bean> variant, yeah i installed ntp-server
[10:15] <DarkMageZ> chuckyp, careful. i know 2 female ops on #ubuntu channels :P
[10:15] <u4ia> I have an old version of RHEL loaded don't know how to mount my usb stick - but 6.10 recognises it so I want to copy a file over using the cd boot version of ubuntu mount my existing RHEL file systems and copy a file on the file system to teh usb stick
[10:16] <variant> bean: that makes you a server serving time to other computers.. i dont think thats what you want
[10:16] <lastnode> sarah, apt-cache search linux generic ? look for the same kernel version but with -generic
[10:16] <bean> oops
[10:16] <bean> ok
[10:16] <Mantice> Whats the updated Xmms called ?
[10:16] <BHSPitLappy> "Ubuntu: Linux for Men!"
[10:16] <chuckyp> lastnode, installing linux-image-generic will install the current version
[10:16] <lastnode> sarah, im assuming you haven't custom compiled any modules etc? because if so they'll need to be reinstalled
[10:16] <lastnode> chuckyp, yes that would work too
[10:16] <lastnode> sarah, what chuckyp said
[10:16] <variant> u4ia: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt && ls /mnt
[10:16] <sarah> lastnode, chuckyp, great, thanks!
[10:16] <variant> u4ia: assuming that /dev/sda1 is the partition of your usb disk
[10:17] <chuckyp> sarah, np

[10:28] <sarah> do I have to reboot in grub to get access to them?
[10:28] <lastnode> sarah, hmm, try removing linux-image-386 ?
[10:28] <lastnode> of course, you could also edit menu.lst yourself

[10:30] <netnull> chuckyp, i also modified xorg.conf
[10:30] <netnull> but quality is not good, its sloow
[10:30] <Magilla_> Screens found, but none have usable configuration
[10:30] <chuckyp> netnull, are you running xgl?
[10:31] <cwillu> I'm trying to use tomboy for largish notes (3 paragraphs), but typing is slowing down.  Can somebody else confirm?
[10:31] <netnull> im on compiz, yes
[10:31] <chuckyp> cwillu, let me see check hold on
[10:31] <sarah> lastnode, chuckyp, ok, looks like it's mostly removed.  here goes the reboot!
[10:31] <shinobi2> anyone have wireless working in 6.10?
[10:31] <cwillu> chuckyp: 50-100 words I start noticing typing lag behinsd
[10:31] <lastnode> :-)
[10:31] <lastnode> shinobi2, what card/chipset?
[10:32] <shinobi2> lastnode: atheos, ath0, was working in 6.06
[10:32] <chuckyp> cwillu, I just pasted a few hundred lines from in here to tomboy note then ckept typing at the bottom no slow donw;
[10:32] <Za1> i have a projector connector via s-video from my laptop.  I can't get the projector going.  anything i need to change?
[10:32] <cwillu> hmm
[10:32] <cwillu> 6.10?
[10:32] <lastnode> shinobi2, out of the box?
[10:32] <lastnode> no drivers etc
[10:32] <shinobi2> lastnode: yes, out of box
[10:33] <lastnode> shinobi2, well i dont see why it wouldnt work on 6.10 then
[10:33] <lastnode> :-)
[10:33] <lastnode> there were some ndiswrapper problems but that's all i know
[10:33] <shinobi2> lastnode: well, it doesn't
[10:33] <chad> i have a bunch of .vob .bup and .ifo files here.. how do i burn them to a usable dvd in Ubuntu? in winxp i only use dvd santa/dvdshrink
[10:33] <cwillu> chuckyp: just did the same (couple hundred lines), and it took a good 10 seconds to show my typing at the bottom :)
[10:33] <chuckyp> Za1, just enable the svideo out for your video card.  Or perhaps try one of the function keys to enable it.
[10:33] <lastnode> shinobi2, that's weird, did you check the bug rpages?
[10:33] <chuckyp> cwillu, no problems here
[10:34] <Magilla_> can anyone help me? I don't care if I have to remove xgl/beryl/nvidia drivers, I need to anyway for the edgy update...
[10:34] <chuckyp> cwillu, which kernel are you using
[10:34] <cwillu> chuckyp: turn on wikiwords and see if it does it
[10:34] <cwillu> generic
[10:34] <chuckyp> cwillu, you mean the links for wording to othe rnotes?
[10:35] <cwillu> Highlight WikiWords is the option
[10:35] <shinobi2> lastnode: nope, where's the bug page? i also updated the packages via eth0, wireless still no work

[10:35] <Mantice> in ubuntu can you set it so that all your inboud / outbount connections go through a proxy ?
[10:35] <chuckyp> cwillu, no still working
[10:35] <cwillu> chuckyp: hmm;  I think it must be a leak or something;  it just crashed, when it came back, it's working fine
[10:36] <cwillu> oh well, I'll work on my repro steps a bit more :)
[10:36] <chuckyp> cwillu, yeah possilby a memory leak but mine is definately fine.
[10:36] <chad> i have a bunch of .vob .bup and .ifo files here.. how do i burn them to a usable dvd in Ubuntu? in winxp i only use dvd santa/dvdshrink
[10:36] <sarah> well, looks like it's still running a little hot, but at least now the temperature is consistently high instead of varying
[10:36] <chuckyp> chad, growfs
[10:36] <HurricaneHarry> Hi all, does anybody have any info on availability of the nl update servers ?
[10:37] <variant> chad: qdvdauthor
[10:37] <chuckyp> chad growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -dvd-video dvd/
[10:37] <lastnode> sarah, both cores seen?
[10:37] <cwillu> chuckyp: it's funny though, because I had just checked its memory usage, and it's exactly where it was before (30mb swap, 10 rss)
[10:37] <variant> !qdvdauthor | chad
[10:37] <ubotu> qdvdauthor: GUI frontend for dvdauthor and other related tools. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 0.1.2-0.0 (edgy), package size 3299 kB, installed size 6700 kB
[10:37] <chuckyp> chad, the last dvd/  is the folder that the video and audio are in .
[10:37] <cwillu> res rather
[10:37] <sarah> lastnode, actually, /proc/cpuinfo still only shows one
[10:38] <shinobi2> lastnode: u think, i should uninstalled the restricted module then install it again?
=== pc3 is now known as Ce_piNkERZz
[10:38] <chuckyp> sarah, my /proc/cpuinfo shows one as well.
[10:38] <lastnode> shinobi2, yeah, maybe the restricted module you have isn't the correct one for your new kernel
[10:38] <shinobi2> what will happen if i use ubuntu's 6.06 kernel to boot 6.10?
[10:39] <variant> shinobi2: your fammily will be killed in a terrible accident
[10:39] <sarah> chuckyp:well, there are temp sensors showing up in gsensors for each one, so something knows I have two
[10:39] <chuckyp> sarah, don't you only have one
[10:39] <shinobi2> is booting 6.10 with 6.06's kernel bad?
[10:39] <cwillu> shinobi2: i'd expect it to still work, although it might be blank until you either get a terminal window or x starting
[10:39] <cwillu> or it might just hang :)
[10:39] <sarah> chuckyp: dual core, one processor.  in dapper this showed up as two
[10:39] <variant> shinobi2: probably it will work
[10:39] <Za1> chuckyp: is there config file I have to configure?
[10:40] <shinobi2> variant: yes, i am sorry for your lost
[10:40] <lastnode> variant, you're not being helpful -> <variant> shinobi2: your fammily will be killed in a terrible accident
[10:40] <lastnode> this is a support channel, witty banter -> -offtopic please
[10:41] <shinobi2> right now my 6.06's fonts are screwed up, i am using kdesktop
[10:41] <lastnode> shinobi2, what kernel are you running?
[10:41] <chuckyp> sarah, yeah I don't believe its going to show up as 2 anyumore.  Even though the system knows there are 2 cores.
[10:41] <shinobi2>  2.6.15-26-386 #1 PREEMPT Fri Sep 8 19:55:17 UTC 2006 i686 GNU
[10:41] <Magilla_> I would really appreciate some help here guys. Heck, acknowledgement that you can see what I'm typing would be a great start...
[10:41] <lastnode> shinobi2, isn't that dapper?
[10:41] <shinobi2> that one lastnode

[10:42] <sarah> chuckyp: any guesses as to why things are running so much hotter than before?  the fan's on all the time
[10:42] <shinobi2> lastnode: yes, i have dapper on edgy on different partitions

[10:42] <Rothbuntu> ..
[10:42] <cwillu> sarah: just upgraded?
[10:42] <chuckyp> sarah, hotter than when?
[10:42] <lastnode> shinobi2, come in on edgy, because that kernel version you showed me was dapper's
[10:43] <frego> Hello, is someone aware of any sunbird package?
[10:43] <sarah> chuckyp, cwillu: than under dapper
[10:43] <thombone> hello :) anyone know of a good tutorial to install and run XGL/Compiz (OR Beryl/Emerald) on Dapper that actually works? I have a Geforce 5500 card in this machine should be good enough but I can never get widgets when I try
[10:43] <cwillu> laptop?  haven't installed any other packages (beagle, etc)?
[10:43] <chuckyp> Whoops sry wrong channel
[10:43] <shinobi2> lastnode: let me check the grub menu file wait.
[10:43] <Magilla_> thanks craigp84
[10:43] <chuckyp> !xgl > thombone
[10:43] <lastnode> sarah, and this is while idling, totally? top shows nothing?

[10:44] <chuckyp> thombone, np
[10:44] <cwillu> sarah: I'm having a hunch that if you disable the composite extension, it might be better, but that's just a guess
[10:45] <sarah> cwillu: I wonder if it is beagle, actually
[10:45] <cwillu> you have that installed?
[10:45] <Za1> how can I get voice chat going with gaim?
[10:45] <shinobi2> lastnode: Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-generic    that's what i have on edgy
[10:45] <cwillu> that could do it
[10:45] <sarah> cwillu: I didn't realize, but it's part of automatix
[10:45] <chad> installing qdvdauth and dvdauth now
[10:45] <cwillu> giggle
[10:45] <lastnode> shini`, what restricted modules are they?
[10:45] <lastnode> sarah, automatix? :o
[10:45] <ogamiitto> need some help on a test mailman install on localhost, i have the vainilla config, i've created a newslw
[10:45] <ogamiitto> ouch, sorry
[10:45] <shinobi2> lastnode: can't come on from edgy, no wifi connection
[10:45] <sarah> lastnode: is it a bad idea?
[10:46] <lastnode> sarah, most definitely. easyubuntu if you must
[10:46] <chad> !growfs
[10:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about growfs - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:46] <lastnode> !automatix
[10:46] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[10:46] <cwillu> sarah: there's history there;  it has a tendency to break stuff
[10:46] <sarah> how embarassing
[10:46] <cwillu> sarah: try uninstalling beagle via synaptic and see if its better
[10:46] <lastnode> sarah, easyubuntu does things nicer, but we'd obviously recommend just installing stuff yourself
[10:46] <ogamiitto> need some help on a test mailman install on localhost, i have the vainilla config, i've created a "newsletter configuration" i send messages to the list (with the moderator account) but it seems that they are not sent
[10:46] <lastnode> if you need something in a hurry though, easybuntu > automatix
[10:46] <sarah> right, beagle is driving up my CPU usage instantaneously
[10:47] <kaptengu> removing .gnome .gnome2 .gnome2_private did not help. there seems to be a problem starting gnome-settings-daemon. how do I fix that?
[10:47] <chad> chuckyp: growfs..what is that?
[10:47] <lastnode> ogamiitto, not to be rude, but #mailman please
[10:47] <cwillu> sarah: it's a nice thing to have, but it's not nice on the battery life
[10:47] <chuckyp> chad, a way to do it in terminal
[10:47] <sarah> cwillu: for some reason it didn't misbehave under dapper
[10:47] <lastnode> sarah, could be the new beagle, then :-)
[10:47] <chuckyp> chad that will burn the dvd from the dvd/  folder  like if you had a video and audio_ts in there.
[10:48] <ogamiitto> lastnode thanks :) been there but there is only 11 people on channel, that is when i've tried here
[10:48] <chad> would be better to learn that
[10:48] <sarah> lastnode: guess I shouldn't be so quick to blame edgy
[10:48] <sky123> hi guys..looks like a bunch of peeps are asleep on the xgl site...hoping to get some help here..with beryl
[10:48] <cwillu> sarah: remove it, (including config I'd guess then), and reinstall then
[10:48] <chuckyp> chad, growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -dvd-video dvd/
[10:48] <sky123> can someone assist with whether it works with amd-64?
[10:48] <cwillu> might just be a conflict, or reindexing a ton of stuff
[10:48] <lastnode> sky123, #ubuntu-xgl is your best bet, mate
[10:48] <cwillu> sky123: try it under a generic kernel first, then go from there
[10:49] <sarah> anything else I should know about automatix?  and any canonical staff, any plans to include an official multi-app installer in a future release that's safe?
[10:49] <chuckyp> chad, man growisofs its a frontend for burning dvds though basically.
[10:49] <chuckyp> sarah, you already hav ea multi app installer  no need for automatix
[10:49] <cwillu> sarah: there's a spec in the works for it;  probably going to be related to easyubuntu, but still not technically supported
[10:50] <chuckyp> sarah, automatix is a hacked way of installing software it doesn't do it properly and removal is a PITA
[10:50] <chad> so growisofs -Z /dev/dvd(my dvd mount point) -dvd-video dvd/    is the last part where i put location for my video-ts folder?
[10:50] <chuckyp> cwillu, its already there
[10:50] <lastnode> sarah, what do you need? codecs etc? easyubuntu is probably your best bet
[10:50] <cwillu> chuckyp: the spec is still open for feisty
[10:50] <Magilla_> craigp84: thanks. Now that I've dropped back to the nv drivers it works again
[10:50] <chuckyp> chad, no the last part like if your video_ts folder was in a folder call debbie  it would be debbie/
[10:51] <Magilla_> I'm going to try and remove the custom stuff and then upgrade to edgy...
[10:51] <chuckyp> cwillu, it will be closed because we already have it.
[10:51] <sarah> lastnode: just wanted a quick way of getting a fresh machine installed with preferred 100 apps without using synaptic or apt-get for each one
[10:51] <lastnode> sarah, there are problems with including non-free stuff with the base distro, or Ubuntu would have done it (like certain other distros which _did_ but are now in some hot water ;-)
[10:51] <paolo> Hi all, do you know how to convert a set of html files into a single pdf file?
[10:51] <lastnode> sarah, write a script, back it up!
[10:51] <lastnode> sarah, share it with your friends even. heh. :-)
[10:51] <lastnode> it'll take all of 15 minutes, and you can reuse it forever
[10:52] <sarah> lastnode: sure, but I bet the automatix folks thought they were doing the same thing :)
[10:52] <chuckyp> lastnode, not when gstreamer changes
[10:52] <lastnode> well theoeretically at least
[10:52] <lastnode> chuckyp, i was getting to that :P
[10:52] <lastnode> sarah, they were, but they were doing it in a not-so-nice-way
[10:52] <lastnode> *even with
[10:52] <sarah> Ok, well, thanks for your help, everyone!  looks like I'll be keeping edgy
[10:53] <sarah> I'll set up a page for my laptop, in the future
[10:53] <Magilla> Yay!!
[10:53] <chad> so growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -dvd-video folder_containing_video_ts/
[10:53] <chuckyp> cwillu, sarah if you want to install multiple apps you just mark multiple ones for install in synaptic.  Or if you want to use terminal sudo aptitude install package1 package2 etc....
[10:53] <Magilla> my xserver works again
[10:53] <lastnode> great, that's nice sarah
[10:53] <jose> espaol

[10:54] <lastnode> jose, /join #ubuntu.es
[10:54] <sarah> chuckyp: it's just nice to have a suggested list of apps, esp. if I don't know what I'll be needing if I'm new to linux
[10:55] <ailean> jose, /join #ubuntu-es
[10:55] <jose> #ubuntu-es
[10:55] <lastnode> jose, type - /join #ubuntu-es
[10:55] <lastnode> sarah, well depends on what you need. most of the stuff you'd need already come with ubuntu
[10:56] <lastnode> sarah, http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/ may help too though
[10:56] <u4ia> variant how do I find out what my usb file system is can't see it in fstab or mtab
[10:56] <lastnode> (full disclosure - ive never tried it :-)
[10:56] <sarah> lastnode: OK, I'll try that next time
[10:56] <sarah> ok, night all!
[10:56] <lastnode> u4ia, of course, it's not mounted at startup
[10:56] <ailean> jose, tienes que hacer "/join #ubuntu-es"
[10:56] <scyth> I can't install ubuntu 6.10. When GDM tries to start X, it crashes my machine... so I can't even start the installation process...
[10:56] <u4ia> what is the device name that I need to look fo r to mount it
[10:57] <scyth> nvidia 6600 is my graphic card, samsung 940B LCD 19" is my monitor
[10:57] <lastnode> u4ia, typically /dev/sda or sdb
[10:57] <u4ia> what is the root password on the cd boot version of ubuntu 6.10
[10:58] <lastnode> !root
[10:58] <ubotu> sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[10:58] <cwillu> chuckyp: https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/common-customizations
[10:59] <scyth> is there any other way to install ubuntu? for examle, ncurses interface ....
[11:00] <incorrect> on distrowatch it says that ubuntu doesn't have webmin?
[11:00] <u4ia> okay I know that the harddrive is sda with partitions sda1 WindowsXP, sda2 /boot sda3 / sda4 swap
[11:00] <u4ia> so presumably sdb
[11:00] <cwillu> incorrect: I believe it's an issue of webmin not having an active maintainer for debian in general;  it's out of date right now
[11:00] <incorrect> thats fair enough
[11:01] <sky123> figured out why beryl would go...need this to the end of the source  to the end main-edgy-amd64
[11:01] <incorrect> i've never been keen on webmin
[11:01] <incorrect> is there an alternative?
[11:01] <cwillu> browser based?  not really;  ssh is the common method of remote admin, vnc access works as well
[11:02] <Keyseir> What's the best installation method for doing a new edgy installation (not an upgrade)? Download an ISO and burn it to disc?
[11:02] <cwillu> there might be something that I don't know of though
[11:02] <u4ia> thanks lastnode & ubotu
[11:02] <mandavi> hi, with what program do i configure my swap-partition (since somehow it is not mounted anymore)
[11:02] <incorrect> cwillu, i was just thinking it might be nice to leave a web tool on some of the servers before i leave ;)  fewer phone calls,  how do i do x y or z
[11:02] <chuckyp> cwillu, its already there.  Add remove programs.
[11:03] <cwillu> chuckyp: please look at the page:  they said like a week ago that they "didn't have time for much of this during Edgy, but it will be a high priority for the team for Feisty"
[11:03] <incorrect> i must admit i am liking ubuntu, especially since winbind auth'ing from ADC has worked everytime
[11:03] <chuckyp> cwillu, please look at your Applications menu click on Add/Remove   The feature is already There.
[11:06] <Keyseir> What's the best installation method for doing a new edgy installation (not an upgrade)? Download an ISO and burn it to disc?
[11:06] <boink> depends on your bandwidth
[11:06] <boink> but most make their own cd's
[11:06] <Keyseir> Slow dsl.
[11:07] <chuckyp> cwil
[11:07] <Keyseir> hm
[11:07] <chuckyp> lol
[11:07] <webben> Keyseir, i downloaded over slow dsl ... use a torrent
[11:08] <webben> remember to md5sum the result
[11:08] <webben> and be prepared to /wait/ :)
[11:08] <webben> (several hours)
[11:08] <chuckyp> Why does everyone say to check md5's i've never downloaded a corrupt file
[11:08] <webben> chuckyp, lucky you; i have
[11:09] <webben> chuckyp, because it takes about 5 seconds to verify a download
[11:09] <Keyseir> !ubotu md5sum
[11:09] <ubotu> To verify the authenticity of a downloaded ISO image.  Command:  md5sum /path/to/file.iso Windows users: http://slavasoft.com and grab Fsum 2.51 or also check: http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/winmd5sum
[11:09] <webben> but burning to disc and then having your install fail is a collossal waste of time
[11:09] <Keyseir> I <3 ubotu
[11:09] <chuckyp> webben, either it works or it doesn.t
[11:09] <webben> chuckyp, well if you've got time to waste
[11:09] <chuckyp> webben, if the iso was borked it mostlikely wouldn't burn
[11:10] <Keyseir> Thanks for the tip webben, I'll follow the precaution.
=== ChaKy is now known as ChaKy_
=== _ChaKy_ is now known as ChaKy
[11:11] <cwillu> chuckyp: only if it was borked by being the wrong size, or a couple specific other failures;  you can change a byte in an iso without making an unburnable iso, while also making an uninstallable iso
[11:12] <sn00p> anybody here can help me on microsd drive support for amd64?
[11:12] <Keyseir> I effed up an upgrade from breezy to dapper, and I've heard upgrading to edgy can have some problems... So I'm going to transfer files to an external HD and start clean with a new install of edgy

[11:15] <dneary> And in System->Preferences->Screen resolution, only 1024x768 shows up
[11:16] <lastnode> meh u4ia , sorry no idea
[11:16] <dneary> xorg.conf looks OK
[11:16] <cwillu> walnut: so you have a port forwarded for bittorrent already?
[11:16] <walnut> I think
[11:16] <dneary> How can I be sure that my screen has really the dimensions it should?
[11:16] <cwillu> walnut: you did it yourself I mean?

[11:20] <duane_> mantice: try checking the ubuntu forums too
[11:20] <duane_> http://ubuntuforums.org
[11:20] <duane_> do a search
[11:20] <Mantice> I restarted Xorg using ctrl alt backspace and nothing happend.
[11:21] <duane_> i dont have ati, but what is supposed to happen?
[11:21] <Keyseir> Could someone tell me where to go for a .torrent for edgy?
[11:21] <duane_> when you restart xorg
[11:21] <chuckyp> Keyseir, the download page
[11:21] <duane_> keyseir: ubuntu.com has one i think
[11:21] <sn00p> !microsd
[11:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about microsd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:21] <Mantice> well your supose to have good fps on screen savers.
[11:21] <sn00p> !micro sd
[11:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about micro sd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:21] <Keyseir> I'm trying to follow the guide on the download page for ubuntu.com, but I don't see a link for downloading a .torrent file where it says there will be one
[11:22] <chuckyp> Keyseir, http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download#currentrelease
[11:22] <walnut> In order to be understood, this is the message I receive if I try to download a new file while another is downloading: (98, 'indirizzo gi\xc3\xa0 in uso')
[11:22] <chuckyp> If you read there it tells you how to donwload the torrent
[11:22] <Keyseir> "To use BitTorrent, choose a link from above corresponding to a location near you. You will see an option for a torrent file."
[11:22] <Keyseir> I'm having difficulty finding the "option"
[11:22] <chuckyp> Keyseir, click on OTher installation options after selecting your mirror
[11:22] <bunny> have ne of u ppl used ossim on ubuntu?
[11:23] <Keyseir> Ah, got it. thx
[11:23] <chuckyp> Keyseir, After that if your scrooll down there are torrents listed.
[11:23] <Keyseir> I see it
[11:23] <Daverocks> hey, i'm planning to install dapper
=== pc3 is now known as cew_PiNKeRZ
[11:23] <chad> anyone here uses dvdauthor/qdvdauthor?
[11:23] <Keyseir> "ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent "
[11:24] <Keyseir> any idea what the "alernate" means?
[11:24] <Mantice> Oh shit I followed the Edgy install instructions .................
[11:24] <Daverocks> what kind of options does the live CD graphical installer give?
[11:24] <bXi> thats a non graphcal installer Keyseir
[11:24] <Daverocks> Keyseir: it's the text-mode installer instead of the LiveCD
[11:24] <Keyseir> Ah, I want "desktop" for the normal one?
[11:24] <gyaresu> evening all.
[11:24] <bXi> you can use both
[11:24] <bXi> but alternate is prefered for computers with low specs
[11:24] <lastnode> Keyseir, text based install, et
[11:24] <lastnode> *etc
[11:24] <lastnode> Keyseir, you most likely need -desktop-i386
[11:24] <Keyseir> Yare
[11:25] <Keyseir> *Yar
[11:25] <Daverocks> does the graphical installer on the LiveCD give the same options as the text-mode installer?
[11:25] <Daverocks> like installing to a specific partition etc
[11:25] <Daverocks> (this is in dapper)
[11:26] <visik7> how can I add a feature or a patch to a kernel and increase its version ?
[11:26] <gigi> ola
[11:26] <bXi> Daverocks: alternate has a few more advanced options if i'm right
[11:26] <visik7> from -10 ro -11
[11:26] <visik7> to
[11:26] <bXi> its been a while snce i last used the alternate cd
[11:27] <Daverocks> bXi: ok, i have both the alternate and desktop CDs... is there some sort of ubuntu desktop installation howto with screenshots so i can see which options i'm presented with?
[11:27] <gyaresu> visik7, Firstly, do you NEED the patch?
[11:27] <visik7> gyaresu: yes
[11:28] <gyaresu> visik7, then i think howtoforge has a good link. *looking now
[11:28] <chad> ack..need some help to use dvdauthor
[11:28] <gyaresu> visik7, http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
[11:28] <visik7> gyaresu: no the howtoforge broke all restricted gone with that howto
[11:28] <visik7> that howto sucks
[11:28] <gyaresu> visik7, sorry. that's annoying then.
[11:28] <bXi> Daverocks: no clue
[11:29] <MJ> wow, just upgraded to Eft. Although upgrade sucked, laptop is rendered useless (touchpad probs which I hope qsyn can solve), xchat takes a while to get used to ;), the team did it again for me. Gratz and thanx to the canonical team and community!
[11:29] <Daverocks> found it, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall looks good
[11:29] <visik7> gyaresu: I just need to know where to set -11 instead of -10
[11:29] <gyaresu> visik7, what device/feature is it for?
[11:29] <Keyseir> seeing 750 seeds and 100 peers, lol
[11:29] <Keyseir> That's what I call seeding.
[11:29] <Keyseir> (ubuntu iso)
[11:29] <gyaresu> visik7, oh. in the Makefile
[11:29] <Mitz> hey brothers
[11:29] <visik7> gyaresu: thanks
[11:29] <Daverocks> it seems that the graphical installer forces you to create a new partition to install on?
[11:30] <Daverocks> or am i wrong?
[11:30] <gyaresu> visik7, wait one (i'm gentoo last 3 years. i'll just see if that's right.)
[11:30] <Mitz> Daverocks, you're beyond wrong. I cannot describe to you how wrong you are.
[11:30] <Daverocks> lol
[11:30] <visik7> gyaresu: mmm seems not
=== Mitz is now known as Sir_Snuffigans
[11:31] <Daverocks> does the graphical installer give me an option to not install grub?
[11:31] <gyaresu> visik7, yeah. just change EXTRAVERSION; but don't leave any spare hyphens dagging off the end.
[11:31] <gyaresu> visik7, do you have the actual kernel source?
[11:31] <bimberi> Daverocks: no
[11:31] <Daverocks> guess i'll use the alternate CD then
[11:31] <visik7> extraversion is set to .13-ubuntu1 and it's replaced somewhere
[11:31] <Daverocks> i want to keep my existing grub
[11:31] <visik7> 'couse the extraversion is -10-generic
[11:31] <Sir_Snuffigans> how do I turn on my computer? I need to use it for I.T programming in the Microsoft Excel. Perhaps someone could help me out with that?

[11:43] <chad> lol..in dvdauthor you can make custom menus and other stuff with ease.. but no friggin way to add a simple video_ts folder..with all the menues and sound..sigh
[11:43] <gyaresu> splintax, also do you mind using the command line options?
[11:43] <splintax> gyaresu: ubuntu install killed my windows install, haven't got around to trying to fix that yet :P
=== bt is now known as _bt
[11:43] <splintax> gyaresu: i am more comfortable with the shell than with the GUI, heh, i've been using bash over SSH for a while but this is my first time using linux on the desktop
[11:43] <gyaresu> splintax,  probably just grub
[11:43] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain> yeah thnk you very much
[11:44] <zoople> still having FLASH issues. Firefox closes all the time now. what can i do
=== chad is now known as chadswill
[11:44] <splintax> gyaresu: nope, can "boot" into windows but i think the graphics card dies halfway through the loading process (with the scrolling blue bar and windows XP logo)
[11:44] <martijn> i'm trying ubuntu now is verry strange for me im used everytime windows
[11:44] <splintax> gyaresu: anyway i'd like to set up the video drivers first because this resolution is friggin' killing my eyes =(
[11:44] <splintax> gyaresu: can I PM you? this is kinda confusing =(
[11:44] <dxdemetriou> gyaresu, It is not here. maybe I will buy a program for printing for now. It is for the scanner I try, I found something for pixma, but can't compile it
[11:44] <sc4ttrbrain> zoople, have you tried installing flash through automatix2?
[11:44] <gyaresu> splintax, fantastic. i am very cli myself. you should just try wacking it with the nvidia-glx package to start with. should "just work TM". then we can tweak the xorg.conf if needs be.
[11:44] <Madpilot> martijn, cool, welcome to Ubuntu
[11:44] <Sociopath> Where can I get a OpenOffice binary not compiled with GCJ (as required by the debian licence)
[11:45] <zoople> sc4ttrbrain: how?
[11:45] <sc4ttrbrain> zoople, do you have automatix2?
[11:45] <zoople> no
[11:45] <fyrestrtr> Sociopath: build from source? :)
[11:45] <gyaresu> splintax, i prefer it in this one window. it's better for you cause other people will but in when i'm wrong ;)
[11:45] <sc4ttrbrain> zoople, getautomatix.com
[11:45] <martijn> thnx madpilot, can i use my games for windows
[11:45] <zoople> sc4ttrbrain: what is it?
[11:45] <bimberi> !automatix
[11:45] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[11:46] <splintax> gyaresu: ok. sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx gives me "nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
[11:46] <splintax> "
[11:46] <gyaresu> dxdemetriou, what model again (is it an all-in-one)
[11:46] <DennyCrane> Erm, I need help, I just did a clean install of edgy, everything was fine, untill I rebooted after updates, now I have no sound, alsamixer -c 0 tells me that its a bad argument.....
[11:46] <walnut> Hi there. Anyone of you could help me to solve a problem with bittorrent?
[11:46] <splintax> gyaresu: which is probably because i've already spent a fair bit of time mucking around with this shit :-(
[11:46] <Madpilot> zoople, automatix is a good way to break your Ubuntu install. It's best avioded.
[11:46] <gyaresu> splintax, so are you using  the nvidia drivers?
[11:46] <zoople> ah ok
[11:46] <Sociopath> fyrestrtr, from what I've seen that takes hours and hours -_-. I was hoping there was an unoffical repo somewhere.
[11:46] <Hirvinen> !easyubuntu
[11:46] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[11:46] <Madpilot> avoided, even
[11:46] <zoople> well...how do i fix my firefox
[11:46] <splintax> gyaresu: i don't know. how would i find out?
[11:46] <gyaresu> splintax, is it just resolution you need?
[11:46] <zoople> it closes all the time coz of flash
[11:46] <splintax> gyaresu: the problem is the resolution, i have a widescreen monitor and can't set it to widescreen resolution.
[11:47] <Madpilot> martijn, some Windows games will run thru WINE or Cedega
[11:47] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>i install UIM how do i trigger it to write jap char?
[11:47] <gyaresu> splintax, try glxinfo
[11:47] <dxdemetriou> gyaresu, yes. it is SmartBase MP700 Photo. the xsane finds it, but in the site writes something about pixma, and sends me to other projects for that
[11:47] <splintax> gyaresu: i know in windows you can tell if you have the drivers installed or not because the windows are less laggy dragging them around.. certainly the windows aren't lagging when i drag them around but that may just be ubuntu
[11:47] <zoople> im having major issues with mozilla because i cant use anything!
[11:47] <zoople> because of flash
[11:47] <martijn> aha thnx
[11:47] <splintax> gyaresu:
[11:47] <splintax> direct rendering: Yes
[11:47] <splintax> server glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
[11:47] <gyaresu> splintax, dude.
[11:47] <splintax> I guess that means I am running the drivers
[11:48] <splintax> gyaresu: so how can I set the resolution to 1440x900?
[11:48] <apokryphos> !resolution
[11:48] <ubotu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type this in a console: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  -  To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[11:48] <splintax> gyaresu: i just assumed it was the drivers. my bad.
[11:48] <gyaresu> splintax, right. have you set it in your modeline or in the devices section?
[11:48] <splintax> ubotu: thanks. are you a bot? hehe
[11:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about thanks. are you a bot? hehe - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[11:48] <splintax> i guess so then
[11:48] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, right click on desktop panel, add to panel uim applet for gnome

[11:49] <Madpilot> plod, Feisty Fawn, it'll be called.
[11:49] <splintax> zoople: I'm a linux noob but shouldn't you be able to uninstall it from Synaptic?
[11:49] <zoople> nah. i installed it thru mozilla
[11:49] <gyaresu> splintax, get on down with the 'sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf'  (backup first, always with the backing up)
[11:49] <zoople> doesnt seem to be in syaptic
[11:49] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, is it done?
[11:49] <plod> madpilot thats ok then i saw feisty on packages.ubuntu and thought it was going to be called feisty ferret
[11:49] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>ok thnks ill try it right away
[11:49] <Uxen> hello
[11:49] <fyrestrtr> zoople: sudo apt-get remove --purge flashplugin-nonfree
[11:49] <Uxen> everybody
[11:50] <splintax> gyaresu: learned that lesson earlier today, tried to edit xorg.conf to setup my G7 (mouse) and i had to restore backup =P
[11:50] <Ayabara> Out of old habit I installed the NoScript extension to FF. Do I even need that for security reasons in Ubuntu?
[11:50] <Uxen> can anyone help me with SATA/RAID disks??
[11:50] <duane_> zoople: type sudo rm /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/flashplayer.xpt in a console
[11:50] <zoople> fyrestrtr: didnt work
[11:50] <fyrestrtr> Ayabara: if not for security, then definately to reduce the annoyance factor :)
[11:50] <Ayabara> fyrestrtr, that's what I thought :-)
[11:50] <gyaresu> splintax, i only have an mx518 mouse and dual CRT monitors but you can have a look at mine: http://gyaresu.org/xorg.conf
[11:50] <zoople> duane_: didnt work
[11:51] <duane_> zoople: might want to do a locate libflashplayer.so
[11:51] <duane_> then rm all occurences
[11:51] <zoople> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[11:51] <duane_> flash will be gone after tat
[11:51] <duane_> that*
[11:51] <Uxen> anybody there??
[11:51] <zoople> how do i locate it?
[11:51] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, fyi, you should have uim,anthy, jap lang pack installed and enabled first
[11:51] <duane_> zoople: type locate libflashplayer.so
[11:51] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>do i need to restart my pc? i can't see the UIm that i install  using the add to panel
[11:51] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, no you shouldnt
[11:51] <zoople> blank
[11:52] <duane_> zoople: sudo rm /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/flashplayer.xpt should work tho
[11:52] <bimberi> zoople: close synaptic if you have it open
[11:52] <fyrestrtr> zoople: close down synaptic first.
[11:52] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo,  have you install uim,anthy,jap lang pack?
[11:52] <zoople> duane_:no such file or directory
[11:52] <hamid> bye
[11:52] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>i only install UIM
[11:52] <duane_> zoople: then you dont have flash installed
[11:52] <duane_> restart your browser
[11:52] <duane_> and flash will be gone
[11:52] <gyaresu> dxdemetriou, Did you see this page? http://linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Canon-PIXMA_MP750
[11:52] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo,hehe,u should install all i ve said
[11:53] <zoople> well b4 i did that, i could load up..lets say YouTube..and it would say i didnt have flash
[11:53] <zoople> now it just crashes
[11:53] <duane_> zoople: maybe cause you dont have flash?
[11:53] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>ok
[11:53] <duane_> i dunno
[11:53] <Uxen> iuuuu
[11:53] <zoople> nah b4 i neva did that
[11:53] <zoople> jsut said i didnt have it
[11:53] <zoople> now it closes Firefox
[11:53] <duane_> but if you dont have libflashplayer.so then you dont have flash
[11:54] <duane_> then it may be another reason why firefox is closing
[11:54] <duane_> maybe because firefox sucks?
[11:54] <duane_> :p
[11:54] <splintax> gyaresu: is there a way to restart X without rebooting?
[11:54] <zoople> when i try to load a page with flah, it crashes
[11:54] <Uxen> THANK YOU
[11:54] <zoople> duane_: alternatives?
[11:54] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>when i try to install anthy, mssg anthy is already the newest version.
[11:54] <splintax> zoople: OPERA OPERA OPERA <33333
[11:54] <duane_> zoople: opera is my favorite. I'm a kde user so I use konqueror too
[11:54] <zoople> ok how?
[11:54] <gyaresu> splintax, CTRTL+ALT+BACKSPACE
[11:54] <TLE> splintax: ctrl+alt+backspace
[11:54] <splintax> thanks
[11:54] <splintax> i thought that restarted something else?
[11:54] <pty> zoople: what version of flash?
[11:54] <sc4ttrbrain> zoople, if you just go to getautomatix.com you ll have everything works in just clicks
[11:55] <splintax> will that take into account the changes to xorg.conf
[11:55] <duane_> zoople: go to opera.com and download the opera browser
[11:55] <gyaresu> splintax, Nope. Just X
[11:55] <queuetue> Hi.  Is there a good mp3-playing jukebox application anyone can recommend?  Easy playlist building, smart shuffling, if possible, ratings, multiple playlists?
[11:55] <duane_> sc4ttrbrain: automatix sucks
[11:55] <zoople> ok
[11:55] <duane_> !automatix
[11:55] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[11:55] <duane_> just go to opera.com and download it from there
[11:55] <gyaresu> splintax, yes (remember to preface with my name or i won't see you )
[11:55] <splintax> gyaresu: so can i get the changes to xorg.conf to take effect without rebooting?
[11:55] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, go to synaptic, search for japanese
[11:55] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain> i try searching UIM on add to panel
[11:55] <gyaresu> splintax, CTRTL+ALT+BACKSPACE
[11:55] <zoople> i think ill like opera..i used to use it in windows years ago
[11:55] <bobslaede> i have some problems with the new edgy, apparently installing java apps... got a clue, from reading a maple howto on ubuntuforums, but i'm not installing maple :p
[11:55] <splintax> gyaresu: /confused okay then.
[11:55] <splintax> brb
[11:56] <duane_> warning: opera kind of sucks with flash 9 tho
[11:56] <zoople> duane_: edgy isnt there to download for?
[11:56] <duane_> zoople: it's ok just download for dapper
[11:56] <bobslaede> problems finding libc.so.6 and libpthread.so.0
[11:56] <zoople> duane_: just get: Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake
[11:56] <Madpilot> sc4ttrbrain, please stop recommending automatix to new users. Thanks.
[11:56] <zoople> righto
[11:56] <RiGLEY> Is it safe to remove automatix, if I have installed a few programs with it ?
[11:56] <duane_> zoople: yep
[11:56] <sc4ttrbrain> Madpilot, sorry dunno that rule
[11:56] <nuts`> hi guys
[11:56] <nuts`> whats best way to reinstall ubuntu?!
[11:57] <gyaresu> bobslaede, have you been messing with gcc?
[11:57] <zoople> lol that closes too
[11:57] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>i search japanese then? :)
[11:57] <gyaresu> nuts`, fdisk
[11:57] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, install anthy ,japanese language pack
[11:57] <bobslaede> gyaresu: no, clean install
[11:57] <splintax> gyaresu: thankyou so much
[11:57] <duane_> zoople: what closes?
[11:57] <splintax> fixed it <3
[11:57] <gyaresu> splintax, WOO!
[11:57] <zoople> the window when i try to get opera
[11:57] <bobslaede> gyaresu: you're thinking wrong gcc version_
[11:57] <bobslaede> ?
[11:57] <duane_> zoople: lol wow
[11:57] <zoople> my Firefox is a wounded animal lol
[11:57] <gyaresu> bobslaede, aye.
[11:57] <duane_> you really broke your firefox
[11:57] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, install uim
[11:57] <TLE> zoople: Hey I haven't been following your problem. Just saw the last part of the discussion. If you don't have anything important in your firefox profile I would delete that, and the mark firefox for reinstallation in synaptic, and see if that fixes firefox, and then install flash support with something like automatix
[11:57] <bobslaede> ah
[11:57] <zoople> does anyone wana send it to me
[11:57] <zoople> ya i dont know how
[11:57] <niktaris> hello all, can anyone give me a link regarding preseeding for use with the ubuntu live cd?
[11:57] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>the anthy package is already mark in green
[11:57] <gyaresu> bobslaede, libc.so rings bells for version of gcc
[11:57] <duane_> zoople: i think i have it hold on
[11:57] <bobslaede> gyaresu: although this is a binary install thing
[11:57] <zoople> kk thanks :)
[11:58] <bobslaede> gyaresu: i'll check that out
[11:58] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, ok then you have it installed
[11:58] <zoople> TLE: how?
[11:58] <bobslaede> gyaresu: gcc version 4.1.2
[11:58] <TLE> zoople: Are you using the 64 bit version ?
[11:58] <splintax> why is there a PGP key called tseliot.asc in my home directory?
[11:58] <gyaresu> bobslaede, get back with error logs if it's still annoying.
[11:58] <zoople> no
[11:58] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, do u have japanese lang pack installed?
[11:58] <TLE> zoople: of Ubuntu
[11:58] <zoople> TLE: no
[11:58] <duane_> zoople: accept the dcc this is the 32 bit version
[11:58] <gyaresu> splintax, you were using Automatix or somesuch?
[11:58] <bobslaede> gyaresu: you want me to paste some stuff?

[11:58] <gyaresu> !pastebin > bobslaede
[11:59] <splintax> gyaresu: no. Although I did open Evolution, but I didn't set up any mail accounts.
[11:59] <bobslaede> gyaresu: 2 sec.
[11:59] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, install language pack gnome ja, there should be a package with that name
[11:59] <squareyes> evening all, have installed base system on old 166 with 64 meg memory, installed xubuntu desktop, but can't get dpkg-reconfigure xserver xorg to recognize a serial mouse, is it possible??
[11:59] <duane_> hrm i just noticed opera was written in qt
[11:59] <gyaresu> splintax, bleeding edge drivers for nvidia/ati
[12:00] <duane_> no wonder its so cool :D
[12:00] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>ok
[12:00] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, you use gnome arent you?
[12:00] <gyaresu> splintax, http://albertomilone.com/driver_edgy.html
[12:00] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>yes
[12:00] <splintax> gyaresu: yep, i (attempted to) install that
[12:00] <dxdemetriou> gyaresu, thanks for help. I try it now
[12:00] <TLE> zoople: ok, then first of all if you don't have anything important in you profile like bookmarks or something like that then we'll start by deleting you profile to make sure it is not posing problems. Close firefox, than in the top menubar (if you are using GNOME) clike places - home.
[12:00] <gyaresu> splintax, hence key.
[12:00] <gyaresu> splintax, (correct res is it?)
[12:00] <gyaresu> dxdemetriou, cool.
[12:00] <zoople> yup
[12:01] <zoople> TLE: done
[12:01] <splintax> gyaresu: yes <3
[12:01] <zoople> duane_: lol how do i accept the dcc?
[12:01] <duane_> zoople: are you using xchat?
[12:01] <zoople> yes
[12:01] <gyaresu> splintax, I'm always amazed when this stuff works.
[12:01] <TLE> zoople: then make it show hidden files, if it is GNOME it is in tha menu show
[12:01] <duane_> zoople: im using konversation, i forgot how to in xchat
[12:01] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>is it on synaptic package? :)
[12:01] <duane_> anyone know how to accept a dcc in xchat?
[12:02] <tim167> How do I boot IBM thinkpad from CDRom ? (it goes straight to windows even though I set startup to CDRom)
[12:02] <zoople> TLE: done
[12:02] <zoople> dcc
[12:02] <InvisiblePinkUni> ubuntu is recognizing my external cdrom drive(connected through USB) after it boots. But not before it boots. How can I use a live CD?
[12:02] <tim167> btw: its IBM Thinkpad G40
[12:02] <badm0j0> i got a dns problem, my ff won't open any page. i configured a static IP with the router IP as gateway and under dns i also used the router ip, but no page opens :(
[12:02] <badm0j0> the configuration works fine under windows
[12:02] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, yes,as u search in synaptic for japanese ,those package will all show up
[12:02] <gyaresu> tim167, you've tried the F2 F9 etc. standards?

[12:03] <plod> bobsalede i dont want apache at all im using lighttpd
[12:03] <bobslaede> oh, sorry then :) i cant help you
[12:03] <TLE> zoople: then open the directory called .mozilla and in that open the directory called firefox, there you should see a folder that has a name with some jibberish followed by a .default in my computer it is vtfrhpug.default, then delete that
[12:03] <zoople> is KDE better?
[12:04] <plod> np thanks, wondering why php5 installed apache
[12:04] <MattJ> There is no /dev/tcp in Ubuntu?

[12:04] <zoople> TLE: yup done that..and reinstalled..all fine now thanks :D
[12:04] <gyaresu> bobslaede, you'll need to feed it options i reckon. like telling it where your shared librarys are
[12:04] <duane_> zoople: that's a flame war waiting to happen
[12:04] <duane_> zoople: but in my opinion definently
[12:04] <gyaresu> bobslaede, are there forums for that software?
[12:04] <zoople> ill get Opera and hope it treats me better
[12:05] <bobslaede> gyaresu: there might be, i'll check that out
[12:05] <zoople> duane_: well i trust u..coz ure nice to me and help me
[12:05] <edulix> hello
[12:05] <bobslaede> gyaresu: didn't need to feed it optins on dapper tho :(
[12:05] <duane_> zoople: if you have the multiverse repos enabled i think you should be able to do sudo apt-get install opera
[12:05] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, language pack gnome ja , and its base, and language pack ja
[12:05] <plod> bobslaede i should have installed php5-cgi ;)
[12:05] <duane_> dunno tho
[12:05] <chadswill> what am i to do with this error? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30517/
[12:05] <bobslaede> plod: did that work?
[12:05] <alluc> are there tools to manage SVG images ?
[12:05] <gyaresu> bobslaede, I reckon there'll be someone with the answer.
[12:05] <plod> yeah it didnt put on apache ;)
[12:05] <zoople> duane_: <#
[12:05] <zoople> duane_: <3
[12:06] <bobslaede> gyaresu: i'll check some forums, thanks
[12:06] <tim167> also,  Partition Magic sees my main XP partition as 'BAD' although I am running windows from it...obviously it doesnt let me make an extra partition for linux
[12:06] <sc4ttrbrain> !anthy
[12:06] <ubotu> anthy: A Japanese input method (backend, dictionary and utility). In component main, is optional. Version 7500-1 (edgy), package size 2749 kB, installed size 10388 kB
[12:06] <zoople> oh wai
[12:06] <zoople> duane_: Package opera is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[12:06] <zoople> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[12:06] <zoople> is only available from another source
[12:06] <zoople> E: Package opera has no installation candidate
[12:06] <sadistic_kitten> I did an upgrade from Dapper to Edgy, via cl and apt-get. things are going fine except that my swap drive isn't loading and I don't know why
[12:06] <sadistic_kitten> and this is kubuntu
[12:06] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>yeah its already mark on green?:)
[12:06] <nino> sadistic_kitten: can we try something quick?
[12:07] <sadistic_kitten> yeah?
[12:07] <duane_> zoople try sudo aptitude install opera
[12:07] <mjbunink> Does anybody know if easyUbuntu is upgraded to work with Edgy?
[12:07] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, right click desktop panel,add to panel
[12:07] <nino> sadistic_kitten: goto system settings/ disks& filesystems
[12:07] <Madpilot> alluc, Inkscape is the SVG editor of choice
[12:07] <chadswill> what am i to do with this error? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30517/
[12:07] <zoople> duane_: you are amazing
[12:07] <sadistic_kitten> k hold on
[12:07] <TLE> zoople: Your welcome, now if you want flash I would recommend using automatix to get, though some people would advice against it. It has alwasy worked fine for me, I have flash working just fine
[12:07] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, add uim applet for gnome
[12:08] <gyaresu> zoople, deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[12:08] <alluc> Madpilot: I need to repeat some specific operations to a big amount of SVG pictures
[12:08] <zoople> duane_: that seemed to go ok..not sure where Opera is now tho lol coz its not in the menu
[12:08] <gyaresu> TLE, And I've found one doesn't need Automatix just the repos.
[12:09] <Madpilot> alluc, try the #inkscape channel; inkscape has a fair number of command-line capabilities, but I don't use those myself
[12:09] <duane_> zoople: type opera in console
[12:09] <gyaresu> TLE, Makes upgrading easier also.
[12:09] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>sorry but still no showing uim applet, maybe i need to restart my gnome?
[12:09] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, oops sorry,you should install uim applet gnome, search that package on synaptic
[12:09] <duane_> zoople: i remember in gnome that you sometimes had to restart x to get things in the menu after you install programs
[12:09] <zoople> oh mait on: No candidate version found for opera

[12:10] <duane_> zoople: probably dont have the multiverse repos set up
[12:10] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, in synaptic search for uim applet
[12:10] <zoople> how do i check?
[12:10] <zoople> lol may as well do that while im here

[12:12] <Skid> hi guys, im looking at ubuntu server.. i see 6.10 is the latest release, but 6.06 is LTS - is 6.10 going to be moved into LTS at all?
[12:12] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, then do the right click thing

[12:13] <tim167> Cant start IBM thinkpad G40 from CDRom, tried boot sequence in bios...
[12:13] <Skid> ok, thanks - so I'm better off with 6.06 ?
[12:13] <zoople> the instructions there dont translate

[12:13] <Skid> ta.
[12:13] <zoople> but in my synaptic..everything is ticked
[12:13] <gyaresu> tim167, have you tried finding the manual?

[12:13] <ctd> or do I need to use a server iso
[12:13] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>is it under accesories?
[12:13] <tim167> i'll have a look
[12:14] <sadistic_kitten> wait found it
[12:14] <gyaresu> ctd, you need the server edition for the one click.
[12:14] <sadistic_kitten> I was in the wrong place

[12:16] <zoople> duane_:so ive got opera..how do i get flash with that
[12:17] <gyaresu> johanmuller, You are going to need to read what you're saying... It's a little cryptic. Try being specific.
[12:17] <queuetue> Is there a good mp3-playing jukebox application anyone can recommend?  Easy playlist building, smart shuffling, if possible, ratings, multiple playlists?
[12:17] <gyaresu> zoople, flashplayer-nonfree
[12:17] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, sorry dunno what your problem is...
[12:17] <johanmuller> alsa devices default
[12:17] <sadistic_kitten> I could but it's still trying to  load atm
[12:17] <highneko> Does anyone know the site where you can test what games you're able to play? For games like Doom3.
[12:17] <gyaresu> zoople, sorry: flashplugin-nonfree
[12:17] <zoople> gyaresu: in synapted
[12:17] <yakumo> <sc4ttrbrain>thnks anyway ill try restart my gnome.....

[12:18] <zoople> gyaresu: in synaptic
[12:18] <shuan> whats difference between ubuntu and ubuntu 64bit?
[12:18] <gyaresu> zoople, is that a question?
[12:18] <nino> sadistic_kitten: take your time
[12:18] <zoople> yup
[12:18] <sc4ttrbrain> yakumo, are u sure its not there under utility, scroll it down
[12:18] <gyaresu> shuan, ubuntu=32bit ubuntu64=64bit
[12:18] <zoople> gyaresu: so go: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[12:18] <gyaresu> zoople, yes.
[12:18] <shuan> yeah i know that but are their any difference on the desktop like visual effects
[12:19] <nolimitsoya> shuan, no
[12:19] <gyaresu> shuan, 64 will be more limited for you if you don't have any specific need and don't know what it is.
[12:19] <highneko> Who's installing the flash plugin? Why not get it from the adobe site?
[12:19] <johanmuller> ASLA devices default does not exsist
[12:20] <johanmuller> im in music player
[12:20] <gyaresu> highneko, because it's available from the command line as a package.
[12:20] <Cromag> !make
[12:20] <ubotu> Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[12:20] <zoople> gyaresu: ok..i get a grey box where the flash should be
[12:20] <gyaresu> johanmuller, (preface your comment with the name of the person so they see you)
[12:20] <Zayal[Helix] > I downloaded ubuntu 6.06 and tried to make a server install. But I get a GUI when I boot from the CD. I'm used to just write 'server' in a console :)
[12:20] <highneko> gyaresu: I have had problems installing flash packages before. it wouldn't hurt to get it from the site. I don't know what's better tho.
[12:20] <nolimitsoya> gyaresu, is flash9 in the repos yet? i dont think it is...
[12:20] <johanmuller> gyaresu
[12:20] <defrysk> zoople, you look for flash9 perhaps ?
[12:21] <zoople> ok
[12:21] <gyaresu> nolimitsoya, no flash 9 for linux as far as i know (beta testing)
[12:21] <snerge> beta is working fine for me
[12:21] <nolimitsoya> Zayal[Helix] , you need the alternate install cd
[12:21] <Zayal[Helix] > ouch
[12:21] <zoople> wonder how to install it for opera?
[12:21] <gyaresu> johanmuller, so you don't have a sound card recognised then it seems? Do you know how to use a command line?
[12:21] <defrysk> zoople, for flash 9 http://seveas.imbrandon.com/ and read the instructions
[12:22] <gyaresu> defrysk, cool.

[12:23] <nino> sadistic_kitten:?
[12:24] <johanmuller> gyaresu dont no how to use the comand line
[12:24] <rodietze> how can I fix it? is gnome so fragile?

[12:24] <johanmuller> yes
[12:24] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone here,using gyachi? i can use all feature like webcam send and recieve,hear their voices, but they cant hear mine
[12:24] <nolimitsoya> rodietze, then somehow your icon theme or window theme is damaged. happend to me once. just edit the config files to a theme thats not
[12:25] <gyaresu> johanmuller, cool. then open a terminal program (gterm, konsole, xterm)
[12:25] <zoople> still dad

[12:25] <luuk> applications->accessories->terminal
[12:25] <rodietze> nolimitsoya,  oh thanks dude!!! I had just no idea what happened, which config file?
[12:25] <johanmuller> where do i find it
[12:26] <gyaresu> johanmuller, Gnome or KDE?
[12:26] <Cromag> !openssl

[12:26] <Skid> bloody hell... ubuntu has changed *loads* since I first used it heh
[12:26] <gyaresu> johanmuller, system or settings or something...
[12:26] <nolimitsoya> rodietze, in gnome, i have no clue. :P my problem was with xfce. still, it should be somewhere in your home dir. also, you can try reinstalling (from command line) the themes you where using
[12:26] <sc4ttrbrain> anyone wants to help me, i cant send my voices using gyachi ..?
[12:26] <johanmuller> its opening
[12:26] <gyaresu> johanmuller, Little black tv icon.
[12:27] <sc4ttrbrain> this is my lsusb output
[12:27] <rodietze> nolimitsoya,  ok I'll try that thanks again :)
[12:27] <nolimitsoya> zoople, did you install the flash9 plugin, or player?
[12:27] <sc4ttrbrain> Bus 004 Device 002: ID 046d:08f0 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Messenger
[12:27] <gyaresu> johanmuller, Right. When it's open type in 'lspci' (all commands without the quotes.)
[12:27] <zoople> lol i dunno
[12:27] <zoople> probably plugin
[12:27] <defrysk> the nonfree thing right ?
[12:27] <gyaresu> johanmuller, lspci is "list pci devices"
[12:27] <nolimitsoya> zoople, you need the plugin. make sure thats what you installed, and restart all browsers
[12:28] <julo> hi
[12:28] <zoople> was plugin?
[12:28] <nolimitsoya> zoople, the file name should be something like 'flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.55-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb'
[12:29] <rambo3> zoople, clear browser cache too
[12:29] <zoople> how do do that?
[12:29] <julo> Does anyone know how to make mgetty automatically start in edgy ? In dapper, I used to add a line in /etc/inittab.
[12:29] <johanmuller> ok finally i got in the terminal
[12:29] <Skid> is reiser better at file serving speed than ext3?
[12:29] <nolimitsoya> zoople, depends on what browser you are running
[12:29] <Skid> (I know it's journaled...)
[12:29] <zoople> opera and firefox
[12:29] <nolimitsoya> Skid, yes, but id suggest jfs2 instead
[12:29] <zoople> whicever one work first
[12:29] <Skid> it's for a server
[12:30] <Skid> I normally use reiser
[12:30] <zoople> rambo3: how do i clear the cache
[12:30] <nolimitsoya> Skid, rieserfs has loads of problems through faulty design. as i said, id go for jfs2. besides, performance is better in almost every respect
[12:31] <rambo3> zoople -> tools .> clear private data
[12:31] <Skid> ok, thanks
[12:31] <johanmuller> ok i have to run quick
[12:31] <johanmuller> chat later
[12:31] <nolimitsoya> Skid, the only thing to be aware of is that if you need online defragmentation, xfs without delayed transaction would be your best bet...
[12:33] <zoople> ok that didnt work
[12:33] <zoople> still getting red square
[12:34] <Skid> jfs doesn't do block journaling thogh... would that cause it to be less likely to hold data during a powerfailure?
[12:34] <nolimitsoya> Skid, the same is true for reiser
[12:34] <Skid> according to wikipedia, it doesw both block and metadata
[12:34] <Skid> ?
[12:35] <Skid> i'll take your advice and give it a burn in anyway :)
[12:35] <BeanBag> how do i force grub to rescan for boot partitions? (win xp not available on grub menu anymore)
[12:35] <nolimitsoya> Skid, if data loss on unclean unmounts is something thats a big problem, youd best use ext3 with data ordered
[12:36] <Skid> nah it's not at all... I'm just curious I suppose... and willing to look at alternative solutions :)
[12:36] <gyaresu> BeanBag, Just write it into the /boot/grub/menu.lst and then recommit it with grub-install
[12:36] <gyaresu> !grub > gyaresu

[12:40] <incorrect> sorry nolimitsoya i am in mild shock and amusement at the same time
[12:40] <kihai> Is there a way to reinstall those apparently broken packages?
[12:40] <Trainstroker> nolimitsoya,gyaresy: but dosent it install to the mozilla aka old firefox location
[12:40] <Trainstroker> the guide i followed got me to install to /opt/firefox/
[12:40] <nolimitsoya> Trainstroker, just sudo apt-get install j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin
[12:41] <kihai> I tried to rename the file, but after  a while update-notifier gave me the same error
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> see what happens. it should work, since its in the repos
[12:41] <gyaresu> Trainstroker, nolimitsoya I don't have that package installed.
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> gyaresu, what package?
[12:41] <gyaresu> nolimitsoya, the j2re1.4*
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> point being?
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> sorry, didnt mean to sound rude...
[12:42] <Trainstroker> nolimitsoya,gyaresy: that didnt help
[12:42] <gyaresu> nolimitsoya, firefox2 && java seem to work.
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> gyaresu, did you install it in some other way then?
[12:42] <gyaresu> Trainstroker, nolimitsoya I have the sun java package installed.
[12:43] <Trainstroker> gyaresu: do u have ff 2 installed?
[12:43] <gyaresu> nolimitsoya, didn't have to do anything special...
[12:43] <gyaresu> Trainstroker, yes.
[12:43] <Trainstroker> gyaresu: did u follow a guide? should i delete the java thing i did?
[12:44] <gyaresu> Trainstroker, I didn't do anything (just testing my install now...wait one)

[12:46] <splintax> anyone know how to make the buddy icons in gaim smaller?
[12:46] <apokryphos> !root | tez_
[12:46] <ubotu> tez_: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[12:46] <fyrestrtr> tez_: type sudo and then the command you need to run.
[12:46] <josh_> i thought that version was a completely seperate install...
[12:46] <josh_> insteresting
[12:46] <nolimitsoya> josh_, it is, but all ubuntu flavours are in the same repo
[12:46] <fyrestrtr> josh_: there is only one 'base' install (that is ubuntu). All the rest, are just different desktop environments.
[12:46] <Trainstroker> gyaresu: sun-java5-plugin - The Java(TM) Plug-in, Java SE 5.0

[12:47] <gyaresu> josh_, apart from terminal services there really isn't much to it as far as i can tell. just install the packages you want. (i reckon)
[12:47] <linux1> splintax: only way i know is to change your screen resolution
[12:47] <splintax> linux1: haha. well that sukcs
[12:47] <splintax> thanks anyway.
[12:47] <fyrestrtr> splintax: I think that's a feature of the theme you are using.
[12:47] <josh_> yeah gyaresu i did that with ubuntu from kubuntu, but i thought edubuntu was a different kernel and so on
[12:47] <gyaresu> splintax, choose different icon set.
[12:48] <splintax> gyaresu: okay, i'll try.
[12:48] <fyrestrtr> josh_: nah, its all the same kernel :)
[12:48] <josh_> i like that
[12:48] <josh_> :)
[12:48] <gyaresu> josh_, for doing what? ;)
[12:48] <josh_> whatever edubuntu is supposed to do i guess... teach kids..?
[12:48] <josh_> lol
[12:49] <josh_> i just wannt get my 2 off windows so they dont turn out stupid ;)

[01:09] <josh_> ahh
[01:09] <josh_> proftpd works well for me
[01:09] <gyaresu> sundari, don't know which is the best specific gnome FTP prog but remember you can mix and match gnome/kde apps...
[01:09] <star39> no screen
[01:09] <josh_> server or client?
[01:09] <sundari> server w/ gui
[01:10] <sundari> will try groftpd then
[01:10] <josh_> proftpd = backend / gproftp = gui frontend
[01:10] <josh_> u need proftpd to use gproftp
[01:10] <josh_> its more complicated with the gui though....
[01:11] <selinuxium_> is there a command to show what video driver i am using?
[01:11] <black_fores> hy...
[01:11] <gyaresu> selinuxium, glxinfo
[01:11] <josh_> yea, more /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:11] <josh_> or what he said
[01:11] <josh_> lol
[01:11] <Magilla> are the "nv" drivers in the xserver config the same as "xserver-xorg-driver-nv" in Synaptic?
[01:12] <bony> is it possible to update the iso image of dapper with edy using jigdo tool?
[01:12] <gyaresu> Magilla, I think yes.
[01:12] <drarem> do you use cp to copy files and dirs to other files and dirs
[01:13] <gyaresu> drarem, cp -rv thing/ stuff/
[01:13] <josh_> cp to copy, mv to move/rename
[01:13] <gyaresu> drarem, man cp
[01:13] <Magilla> I re-setup xserver to use "nv" drivers instead of nvidia drivers. Does this mean I can use synaptic to completely remove nvidia-glx safely, or are there other things that I have to change first?
[01:13] <Joelio> ARRRRRRGGGH!!!!!!! My edgy upgrade has crapped out half way through
[01:13] <Joelio> ARRRRRRGGGH!!!!!!! My edgy upgrade has crapped out half way through
[01:13] <Joelio> I need to recover, but and apt-get -f doesn;'t work!
[01:13] <netpython> Magilla: yes
[01:14] <gyaresu> Joelio, it's fine. just 'sudo apt-get -f install'
[01:14] <Joelio> gyaresu.. no, it doesn't
[01:14] <josh_> Joelio: try adding install to the end of that apt-get statement :)
[01:14] <bony> is is possible to update the iso image of dapper with edgy using jigdo?
[01:14] <gyaresu> Magilla, should be able to uninstall glx but it will tell you.
[01:14] <drarem> k
[01:14] <gyaresu> Joelio, what's the error.
[01:14] <josh_> Joelio: then try, apt-get update, apt-get -f install
[01:14] <Joelio> E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
[01:14] <josh_> bony: no idea
[01:15] <Magilla> gyaresu, netpython: thanks. I'm currently removing all the non-standard stuff pre-upgrade to Edgy :)
[01:15] <TLE_02> JosefK: Hey
[01:15] <JDahl> has anyone here build xemacs-21.5.27 from source on Ubuntu?  I wanted to try the xft support,  but I can't quite figure what libraries xemacs depends on
[01:15] <JosefK> TLE_02: hey - found a fix for the console switching bug yet?
[01:15] <gyaresu> Joelio, Did you do some funky package stuff at some point?
[01:15] <Joelio> josh_ no luch
[01:15] <Joelio> s/luch/luck
[01:15] <netpython> Magilla: success:-)
[01:15] <Magilla> should I remove the nvidia-restricted packages?
[01:15] <josh_> hmm.. was this a fresh install or an upgrade?
[01:16] <gyaresu> JosefK, did you check the bugs listing/
[01:16] <Joelio> gyaresu: maybe used automatix
[01:16] <gyaresu> JosefK, did you check the bugs listing?
[01:16] <rooti1> hi, when i installed ubuntu it autoconfigurated my X11/xorg.conf with the right names e.g. monitor and gfx ... is there a way to do this again ?
[01:16] <Joelio> josh_ an upgrade from Dapper
[01:16] <bony> josh_, well i use jigdo to update iso image of debian regularly that way i save lot of bandwidth and space too. though if it is possible to use the same method with ubuntu too
[01:16] <JosefK> gyaresu: not yet, have a link? (I'm not affected by it)
[01:16] <gyaresu> Joelio, Right. You may need to remove some packages and do a bit of fiddling.
[01:16] <josh_> bony, dont know... i dont mess with iso's much
[01:16] <josh_> Joelio: got a spare drive to back data up to? :P
[01:16] <gyaresu> JosefK, So why am I going to search for a bug that doesn't affect you?
[01:17] <bony> josh_, ok cool i will check out
[01:17] <Magilla> netpython: I'm hoping for success ;)
[01:17] <JosefK> gyaresu: I didn't ask you for the link?  It was TLE-02, who's affected by it and pointed me to it before
[01:17] <JosefK> gyaresu: which bug do you think I'm talking about, btw?
[01:17] <Joelio> josh_ yea, I'm thinking the same
[01:17] <drarem> why is it when i type exit under konsole it says there are stopped jobs. then i type exit again to exit?
[01:17] <Joelio> Here's a paste http://pastebin.ca/242559
[01:18] <gyaresu> JosefK, I don't know the console switching bug but it would be best to follow the bug tracker page.
[01:18] <black_fores> hy...
[01:18] <Magilla> netpython: should I remove the nvidia-restricted packages?
[01:18] <drarem> and why is it sometimes i have to pull up a sys admin tool that requires a password twice - the first time it will time out?
[01:18] <Magilla> as well?
[01:18] <drarem> i mean the icon will animate and then disappear
[01:18] <JosefK> gyaresu: thanks, however I wasn't asking you, and I imagine the person affected (TLE-02) has the link
[01:18] <netpython> Magilla: isnt necessary
[01:19] <TLE_02> TLE_02: It wasn't a console switching bug but I have found a way around it. It seems that the script that enterprets boot options and modify the xorg.xonf is broken. And therefore what you suggested didn't work either. But somebody posted a workaround so the boot process pauses half way through and then it is possible to modify the xorg.conf so that it boots with the vesa or radeon driver instaed. So now I have Edgy installed, wuhu
[01:19] <Magilla> ok, thanks
[01:19] <Fastly> can anyone here point me in the right direction re setting up my ubuntu system as a mailserver and enabling email to be sent via my php apps?
[01:19] <Fastly> is sendmail the right option?
[01:19] <JosefK> TLE_02: ah, nice :) I thought the 'radeon' driver might fix the problem too
[01:19] <josh_> Joelio: what im thinking you will have to do is just back up what you cant live without, then reboot into recovery mode in dapper, then do the upgrade again
[01:19] <gyaresu> JosefK, My apologies. I just scrolled up and realise you wern't just asking the channel. Much sorry.
[01:19] <JosefK> gyaresu: np's :) thanks
[01:19] <wickedpuppy>  Fastly i would recommend postfix
[01:20] <iami89> is 'radeon' driver support ati radeon 7000?
[01:20] <BuckAchi> ive noticed that fedora updates quite often
[01:20] <BuckAchi> ubuntu too
[01:20] <Joelio> josh_ yea, I'm trying to remove packages, but it's as though they're pinned
[01:20] <Magilla> one other question, can someone point me to the list of repos I need for the upgrade so I can remove all the others?
[01:20] <bionoid> Fastly: You don't need a full flexed mail server to do that, and certainly not sendmail. If you need very complex mail handling, sendmail is great (but not necessarily safe). I'd recommend Postfix - many people like qmail also (but I havn't tried it)
[01:20] <BuckAchi> I was wondering if the updates to ubuntu are neccesary, how often should i have my system update?
[01:20] <gyaresu> Fastly, Do you know of the server edition of ubuntu? Are you experienced at servers?
[01:20] <Fastly> thanks guys
[01:21] <TLE_02> JosefK: gyaresu: Just to clear things up, I was following this bug because it fit my problem: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/67487 but in fact it is more general problem described in this bug: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/59618
[01:21] <Fastly> gyaresu: well i'm using it as a desktop too
[01:21] <Fastly> this is only for hosting my shitty little blog
[01:21] <josh_> Joelio: no need to remove packages, once you get your stuff backed up and load into recovery and do your upgrade it should find the other packages
[01:21] <Fastly> that doesn't get much traffic yet
[01:21] <JosefK> indeed TLE_02, I've seen that bug before when I had an X800, in fact, it was that (and other annoyances) that made me stump up for an nvidia card
[01:21] <apokryphos> Fastly: language please
[01:21] <gyaresu> Fastly, You don't play online games that care about ping then? :)
[01:22] <Fastly> nope
[01:22] <Fastly> apokryphos: noted, sorry...
[01:22] <Magilla> Packages removed
[01:22] <iwaterball> BuckAchi: if your system is online it will offer you to update almost once a week, you usually update with a painless couple of mouse-clicks
[01:22] <Joelio> josh_ ok mate, I'll try.. I'm going to have to leave it for now though, I can't risk the downtime
[01:22] <josh_> np
[01:22] <gyaresu> Fastly, Then you just need a lamp server with wordpress i'm assuming?
[01:22] <BuckAchi> hm, ok
[01:23] <drarem> what's the command to remove a dir w/files?
[01:23] <josh_> rm -R
[01:23] <Fastly> i'm really just testing drupal 5 beta with a space domain and dyndns
[01:23] <drarem> thanks
[01:23] <Fastly> s/space/spare/
[01:23] <TLE_02> JosefK: I have an X800XL and will bee getting a NVIDIA very soon. So as you may know the "ati" driver has never worked with that card. It has just always been easy to fix, because I just always installd the fglrx in a hurry and be done with it, but that was somewhat more difficult this time
[01:24] <iami89> how to clean up system & remove application{which install after install system}
[01:24] <josh_> apt-get remove applicationname ; apt-get clean applicationname
[01:25] <Magilla> can someone point me to the list of repos I need for the upgrade so I can remove all the others?
[01:25] <Magilla> please?
[01:25] <Magilla> :)
[01:25] <josh_> or if you compiled from source it would be dpkg -r purge applicationname...? i think thats what it is
[01:25] <gyaresu> !repos > Magilla
[01:26] <Magilla> thanks gyaresu
[01:26] <apokryphos> magical_trevsky: check the channel topic for ugprading please
[01:26] <apokryphos> * Magilla
[01:26] <josh_> lol
[01:26] <bony> josh_, do have an idea of what these names mean "alternate, desktop, server" i know what desktop and srever mean but don't know what alternate means. there are jigdo files for alternate server but there are no jigdo files for desktop.
[01:26] <gyaresu> Magilla, You're welcome.
[01:26] <apokryphos> bony: check the FAQ
[01:26] <Magilla> the only non-standard packages I have now are Skpye, Opera, and Picasa
[01:26] <bony> apokryphos, ok
[01:26] <Magilla> *Skype
[01:26] <iwaterball> josh_: if you compiled from source dpkg doesn't usually know about the app unless you used checkinstall, in that case you uninstall with "make uninstall" from the source dir
[01:26] <apokryphos> Picasa :O
[01:27] <Magilla> apokryphos: Automatix install
[01:27] <apokryphos> yuck
[01:27] <apokryphos> !automatix
[01:27] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:27] <josh_> ahh thats right iwaterball
[01:27] <atlas95> hello!
[01:27] <josh_> lol now you see how much i uninstall stuff
[01:27] <atlas95> someone could help me please?
[01:27] <apokryphos> but also, there's so many native decent image managers in Linux, why would you use a wine-Picasa?
[01:27] <atlas95> anybody ask me on french channel lol
[01:27] <josh_> nope... we are all just sitting here talking about our wives/hubbies
[01:28] <gyaresu> !helpme > atlas95
[01:28] <gunfus> hi guys, during the install i forgot to install the LAMP server can I do that through apt-get..?
[01:28] <Tidus> apokryphos, most of the google branded apps are cross platform
[01:28] <Tidus> the only one that isn't at the moment is the Desktop Search
[01:28] <apokryphos> Tidus: picasa isn't
[01:28] <atlas95> i just want to set luminosity of my lcd
[01:28] <Jewfro-Macabbi> yes it is
[01:28] <josh_> gunfus, sudo apt-cache search lamp
[01:28] <josh_> then install it
[01:28] <apokryphos> Tidus: their Linux port is running in wine
[01:28] <atlas95> via my function key on my laptop
[01:28] <gyaresu> !fr > atlas95
[01:28] <atlas95> ?
[01:28] <apokryphos> so not really a "port"
[01:28] <atlas95> gyaresu: you don't understand me?
[01:29] <Tidus> is wine somehow linked in?
[01:29] <gyaresu> atlas95, You were asking about french. no?
[01:29] <gunfus> josh_: Nothing
[01:29] <apokryphos> Tidus: it comes with a built-in wine, yes. Very ugly.
[01:29] <josh_> atlas95: he just sent you an im with a link to the french ubuntu channel
[01:29] <josh_> hold please gunfus
[01:29] <gunfus> josh_: holding..
[01:29] <tim167> I booted IBM Thinkpad G40 from CDRom, clicked open Firefox, but nothing happens. CDRom drive keeps looking for something, for 15 minutes now...
[01:29] <josh_> ubuntu-lamp - Packages for a LAMP setup
[01:29] <Tidus> apokryphos, ah... ok... was just checking because the command 'wine' doesn't exist on my computer
[01:30] <josh_> tidus, you have to install it
[01:30] <iwaterball> gunfus: which ubuntu version?
[01:30] <apokryphos> when there's things like f-spot and digikam, can't imagine why you'd want to use their winepicasa
[01:30] <gunfus> iwaterball: 6.10 server
[01:30] <gyaresu> tim167, might not like the CD. could be the brand or even a CRC error.
[01:30] <gunfus> josh_: I tried 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-lamp' but nothing
[01:30] <atlas95> I have say any body had ask me on french channel :)
[01:30] <apokryphos> !lamp | gunfus
[01:30] <ubotu> gunfus: lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[01:31] <atlas95> so i ask here ! :)
[01:31] <drarem> can i use the gnome partition editor to resize my current partition and my windows partition to  to get more space
[01:31] <tim167> gyaresu: ok Ill try other CD
[01:31] <drarem> without destroying data
[01:31] <Tidus> apokryphos, strangely enough, automatix offers to install what they call "iLinux" ... Banshee, F-Spot, and Kino
[01:31] <chuckyp> drarem, in theory but I would backup any data before resizing
[01:31] <josh_> gunfus: u have all the repos?
[01:31] <phanter> hi there, if I am logged in on my ssh server via ssh can I use that same connection to enter my laptop via that server (laptop does not have sshserver installed)
[01:31] <drarem> k
[01:31] <apokryphos> Tidus: automatix is bad :)
[01:31] <chuckyp> drarem, anytime you resize a partition you run the risk of losing data.
[01:32] <gyaresu> drarem, I always  prefer a second drive but if you have a livecd you can.
[01:32] <gunfus> josh_: except the CD.. i commented out the CD.. hmm let me check if the other repos are commented out.. that would be silly wouldn't it
[01:32] <defrysk> !automatix | Tidus
[01:32] <ubotu> Tidus: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[01:32] <josh_> lol gun
[01:32] <chuckyp> phanter, what now you want ot log in like this box > server > laptop?
[01:32] <chuckyp> defrysk, atutomatix sucks
[01:32] <Tidus> defrysk, who said i was using it
[01:32] <phanter> chuckyp: yes
[01:32] <josh_> !easysources| gunfus
[01:32] <ubotu> gunfus: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[01:32] <chuckyp> phanter, yes but the server and laptop would both need to be listening to for a connection
[01:33] <drarem> use a second drive like a usb drive as an addition to my $HOME folder..
[01:33] <josh_> get all those and just leave the french ones commented out... they dont seem to work...
[01:33] <therapy> !easysources
[01:33] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[01:33] <phanter> chuckyp: so I cannot reuse the connection that I already established in the other direction?
[01:33] <drarem> it's all this other stuff from the repo too, going into the sys and var folders
[01:33] <chuckyp> phanter, keep in mind when you are ssh'd into the server you are executing comands just as if you where sitting there.  So that box should be able to ssh out as well.
[01:33] <gunfus> josh_: That doesn't support edgy
[01:33] <chuckyp> phanter, oh you want to do laptop > sever > laptop  ???
[01:33] <josh_> really... ?
[01:34] <Magilla> where would I find sources.list?
[01:34] <atlas95> anyone can help me?
[01:34] <josh_> /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:34] <phanter> chuckyp: actually: *something*>server>laptop and there is now a connection like: *something*>server<laptop
[01:34] <chuckyp> phanter, why on earth would you want to do that for one?  Since you are at the laptop you can just execute comands locally instead of ssh'ng back to it.
[01:34] <gyaresu> Magilla  you can use 'locate' as well.
[01:34] <apokryphos> Magilla: it's really worth looking through the FAQ :)
[01:35] <chuckyp> phanter, yeah you just need to set the laptop up to listen
[01:35] <chuckyp> phanter, just like you did with the server.
[01:35] <gyaresu> Magilla, ^^ that's true.
[01:35] <Jewfro-Macabbi> magilla /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:35] <Magilla> :o
[01:35] <apokryphos> ubotu: faq
[01:35] <ubotu> faq is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions Official documentation is at http://help.ubuntu.com IRC FAQ: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRCResourcePage
[01:35] <phanter> chuckyp: oke, so i cannot reuse the ssh connection that I already have from laptop>server
[01:35] <phanter> oke thanks
[01:35] <Magilla> I've never seen the locate command before
[01:35] <Magilla> thanks
[01:35] <Magilla> :D
[01:36] <apokryphos> Magilla: it's good but it won't be up-to-date unless 'updatedb' has been run recently
[01:36] <gyaresu> Magilla, 'sudo updatedb' will update the locate database
[01:36] <chuckyp> phanter, You may just have to tell the laptop to listen on a different port if it gives you trouble.
[01:36] <phanter> oke thanks :)
[01:36] <gyaresu> Magilla, Remember 'man' | plus you can search for 'man' entries by using 'apropos'
[01:36] <chuckyp> phanter, i.e. the laptop is already connect sever < laptop  and you want to server > laptop while its connected you may have to have the laptop listening on a different port.  But that should be easy to setup with sshd configuration.
[01:37] <Magilla> hehe. I know 'man'. What does apropos mean?
[01:37] <gyaresu> Magilla, man apropos :)
[01:38] <chuckyp> Magilla, try it apropos update
[01:38] <chuckyp> gyaresu, lol
[01:38] <therapy> gyaresu : lol
[01:38] <chuckyp> Magilla, it searches the man database.  So if you can't quite remember the name of a command you just search for it with apropos
[01:38] <Magilla> gyaresu: :P The man page doesn't say
[01:38] <sini> (list
[01:39] <scheuri> anyone using 3Ware controllers (9550 or 9650) with 6.06 Dapper (32bit) and having issues?
[01:39] <Magilla> I have problems remembering commands if I don't know what the word means, or stands for...
[01:39] <gyaresu> Magilla, Really... "Each manual page has a short description available within it.  apropos searches the descriptions for instances of keyword."
[01:39] <chuckyp> Magilla, well if you know what the command does you can search for it that way.
[01:40] <chuckyp> Magilla, like apropos delete  brings up rm rmdir etc....
[01:40] <Magilla> yes, but I'll never remember "apropos" if I don't know what the word "apropos" means, or stands for
[01:40] <gabe_> can anyone tell me if there is an easy way to upgrade edgy eft to the 2.6.18 kernel
[01:40] <Magilla> eg cp means copy
[01:40] <francix> it's not easy for windows users to use linux, we're probably worse off than people with no computer experience at all imo
[01:41] <Magilla> ja
[01:41] <Magilla> probably
[01:41] <gyaresu> Magilla, http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=0&oi=define&q=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn%3Fs%3Dapropos&usg=__uJVHI2xmP-RTWPCHs1cdidUwOTg=
[01:41] <chuckyp> Magilla, it means to the purpos
[01:41] <gyaresu> Magilla, (adj) apropos (of an appropriate or pertinent nature)
[01:41] <shuan> hi
[01:42] <goara> which package do i need to download to just have the java runtime environment and be able to have applets in mozilla?
[01:42] <chuckyp> Magilla, http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/netdict?apropos
[01:42] <Magilla> ah
[01:42] <chuckyp> Magilla, thats a definition
[01:42] <francix> like the word "mount" what the hell? in windows you just open a harddisc by double clicking it
[01:42] <Magilla> as in "what's appropriate"
[01:42] <shuan> can someone please tell me how to watch mpg on totem?
[01:42] <Magilla> I see
[01:42] <Haitao> Hi all
[01:42] <Magilla> thanks
[01:42] <Magilla> I assume it's latin or something
[01:42] <gyaresu> shuan, What's not happening (specifically)
[01:42] <chuckyp> Magilla, yeah whats appropriate to the current context
[01:42] <chuckyp> Magilla, french
[01:42] <Magilla> sweet
[01:43] <goara> shuan : http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Codecs
[01:43] <chuckyp> Magilla, well its origins are french
[01:43] <shuan> i try to watch mpg files on totem movie player but its not supported
[01:43] <shuan> thanks
[01:43] <chuckyp> !codecs > shuan
[01:43] <Haitao> just a quick one. In Dapper there was a graphical mount tools which seems to have been removed in Edgy. What was it or do you know another one
[01:43] <netpython> !codecs | shuan
[01:43] <ubotu> shuan: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  -  See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html  -  But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:43] <Haitao> shuan: you can probably go to ubuntuguide.org, it's all explained
[01:43] <Magilla> thanks guys
[01:43] <chuckyp> netpython, I already told him.
[01:43] <highneko> Hello. I just had a problem when starting doom3-demo. I messed it up somehow, my screen resolution changed and I couldn't exit the game after it wasn't working. I ended up rebooting using a ctrl+alt+f1 terminal thing. How could I have exited the game without a restart?
[01:43] <chuckyp> Magilla, np
[01:44] <francix> how do i know what version of linux i have, i think i have dapper but not sure
[01:44] <chuckyp> highneko, gone to terminal 1 like you did and killed theprocess
[01:44] <gyaresu> highneko, you could have just restarted X by ctrl+alt+backspace
[01:44] <chuckyp> highneko, killall doom3-demo
[01:44] <highneko> chuckyp: Exactly what I tryed.
[01:44] <visik7> is there a way to get a packetized version of ipw3945 (eg via module-assistant) without restricted?
[01:44] <chuckyp> gyaresu, that wouldn't kill the process
[01:44] <iwaterball> francix: I think you can get a hint with "cat /etc/issue" not sure that works in ubuntu though
[01:44] <francix> no big red button here,
[01:44] <goara> what package do i need to download for just the java runtime environment?
[01:45] <defrysk> Haitao, add to panel > system and hardware > disk mounter
[01:45] <Magilla> I've removed all non-std packages, so it will suck if this breaks...
[01:45] <gyaresu> chuckyp, res would be fubar though without x restart
[01:45] <chuckyp> highneko, wellt hat would have done it.  Or you can kill by pid  i.e. ps aux | grep doom3  get the pid and kill 12345123  or whatever it is.
[01:45] <highneko> chuckyp: That process sisn't exist, so I did a "ps -e | grep doom" and I found it and killed it, but when I did a alt+ctrl+f7, It wouldn't work.
[01:45] <chuckyp> highneko, then I would restart X sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[01:45] <ailean> I need a bit of help with boot sectors. My system won't boot Ubuntu or Windows. Can someone give me a bit of one to one assistance?
[01:45] <gyaresu> chuckyp, pkill (works on just part of the proc name)
[01:45] <Haitao> defrysk: I like it in the menus? is that possible?
[01:45] <chuckyp> highneko, yeah then you would just need to restart X
[01:45] <gyaresu> ailean, sure.
[01:45] <defrysk> Haitao, rightclick your panel on an empty spot
[01:46] <ailean> gyaresu, can i msg u?
[01:46] <internat> stupid question, does ubuntu have a testing section? like debian does? if so what is it currently called?
[01:46] <Jewfro-Macabbi> gyaresu, really, so I can just pkill k3b, for example?
[01:46] <Haitao> defrysk: I know how to add to panel.. just don't want to use that space (already busy)
[01:46] <gyaresu> Jewfro-Macabbi, aye.
[01:46] <Jewfro-Macabbi> cool
[01:46] <gyaresu> Jewfro-Macabbi, Yep.
[01:46] <chuckyp> Haitao, then add it to the menus
[01:46] <highneko> chuckyp: I found a process callled doom3.x86 or something, and killed it. Shouldn't alt+ctrl+f7 have went back to my desktop? I saw a cursor but it wouldn't even move.
[01:47] <gyaresu> internat, At the moment you just need Edgy.
[01:47] <Haitao> chuckyp: I'll try then. thanks guys
[01:47] <highneko> chuckyp: I had the demo working ok before. I'm afraid to try and fix it now.
[01:48] <francix> hehe i've installed linux to NOT play games while using the computer, works great
[01:48] <chuckyp> highneko, yes it would but if the resolution was all messed up you would have had to restart X to get it back.  hence the sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[01:48] <chuckyp> francix, lol
[01:48] <highneko> chuckyp: Ah, interesting. Would I lose my unsaved data?
[01:48] <Magilla> OK then.  I'm going to leave the update manager to chew all my bandwidth plus some more
[01:49] <chuckyp> highneko, yes most likely
[01:49] <Magilla> thanks for the help and patience guys
[01:49] <Magilla> here's hoping that the preparation means that all will go well
[01:49] <Magilla> ^_^
[01:49] <francix> heck if i manage to play a mp3 on that thing i will be happy
[01:49] <highneko> chuckyp: Wouldn't ctrl+alt+backsace have the same effect?
[01:49] <gyaresu> Magilla, good work Magilla.
[01:49] <Magilla> see ya later
[01:50] <chuckyp> highneko, yes unless X is completely frozen then you would have to do it the way I mentioned
[01:50] <wickedpuppy> francix, mp3 on ubuntu ?
[01:50] <highneko> chuckyp: A backup plan is always nice. Thank you.
[01:50] <chuckyp> highneko, there is also xkill where you can just click on an app to kill it.
[01:50] <highneko> I love xkill. Best program ever!
[01:50] <Magilla> only 2 hours of downloads left...
[01:50] <chuckyp> highneko, if you hit alt+f2 to get a run prompt   then just type xkill
[01:50] <highneko> i tryed that too. ;)
[01:50] <chuckyp> highneko, or make a keyboard shortcut for it.
[01:50] <francix> i think it's possible
[01:50] <ailean> gyaresu, I first installed Windows because I knew that it would overwrite the MBR. I installed it on the second HDD, not realising that it still booted from the first.  I then installed Ubuntu on the first, which overwrote the Windows boot sector.  So, I decided to try to get the Windows boot sector back, and disabled the first HDD in the BIOS, in order to preserve GRUB.  I hoped to update it once Windows successfully booted
[01:50] <ailean> .  But, when I tried to update the MBR of Windows, it overwrote GRUB anyway, and still didn't boot Windows.  So, now I'm left with a system that boots nothing.  I'm only in here with the help of the Super Grub Disc
[01:51] <wickedpuppy> francix, whats possible ? mp3 on ubuntu ?
[01:51] <francix> yes
[01:51] <francix> wicked
[01:51] <francix> it works
[01:51] <chuckyp> ailean, boot the windows disk and fdisk /mbr  will repair the windows boot record.
[01:52] <wickedpuppy> francix, i been playing mp3 in linux since red hat 7 days :P its not even a question now :P
[01:52] <chuckyp> ailean, or maybe its fixmbr  can't remember you'll see the exe on the windows disk there.
[01:52] <netpython> ailean: enter fixmbr at the dos-prompt
[01:52] <sikor_sxx> i have ubuntu installed together with windows 2000
[01:52] <francix> wicked : for us newbies opening a doc in linux is a daywork
[01:52] <chuckyp> ailean, that will atleast fix windows.  If you wanted to fix grub boot the ubuntu cd and reinstall grub on the drive.
[01:53] <wickedpuppy> francix, doc ? btw type wicked and press tab
[01:53] <sikor_sxx> i need to update the win2k partition to winxp, but i guess the MBR will be overwritten by stupid winxp
[01:53] <gyaresu> ailean, sikor_sxx chuckyp yeah, but do you guys understand exactly which os is on which disk?
[01:53] <ailean> chuckyp, I've tried to reinstall GRUB, but it still tries to boot Windows...
[01:53] <sikor_sxx> is there a way to restore grub in MBR?
[01:53] <chuckyp> !grub | ailean
[01:53] <ubotu> ailean: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[01:53] <francix> wickedpuppy, a document
[01:53] <rsl> Does anyone have any idea why my sound might be suddenly going in and out? I haven't updated anything at all but [and this is a recurring problem]  when I play music [with any player]  it suddenly stops playing the music then, after a brief period of time, plays a portion of the last part of the mp3 played and skips ahead in time to where [had it been playing all along]  it would be at the moment. Anyone?
[01:53] <ailean> Ubuntu is on (hd0,0) and Windows is on (hd1,0)
[01:53] <chuckyp> gyaresu, no I though both were on the same disk.
[01:53] <gyaresu> chuckyp, don't think so.
[01:54] <doccy> where is the smbpasswd file located?
[01:54] <sikor_sxx> how can i reinatll grub?
[01:54] <wickedpuppy> francix, installing mp3 needs no document ... all i did was google and there was tons of forums on all distros on playing mp3
[01:54] <gyaresu> ailean, two HDD's? primary & slave on same channel?
[01:54] <chuckyp> ailean, gyaresu ahh well make the hd0,0  unbootable   then fix mbr on the xp drive.
[01:54] <ailean> gyaresu, yes
[01:55] <francix> wickedpuppy, it was merely an expression to show that even the easiest things are hard to do when you are new to the linux system
[01:55] <chuckyp> gyaresu, he probably has to change the boot flag for the / partition on the hd0,0 is his problem.
[01:55] <chuckyp> gyaresu, if he wants to switch it because the system sees both drives as bootable and doens't know what to do.
[01:55] <wickedpuppy> francix, perhaps ... my apology if i sound rude ..
[01:55] <gyaresu> ailean, chuckyp something like that.
[01:55] <rsl> Does sound get written to a file or buffer somwhere that could be getting full? I really want to figure out this problem so I don't have to reinstall Ubuntu every month.
[01:55] <sikor_sxx> when i use the ubuntu instal disk, i can mount the harddisk. what can i do to reinstall grub with the settings on the harddisk?
[01:56] <ailean> chuckyp, gyaresu how does that work then? how can i change this "flag"?
[01:56] <gyaresu> ailean, can you boot to grub?
[01:56] <therapy> francix : you should try BSD sometime :)
[01:56] <ailean> gyaresu, no
[01:56] <phenex> upgrade from dapper to edgy - no sound. i hear my mic, but can't play music or record... any idea what can cause this?
[01:56] <francix> wickedpuppy, none taken, i think most linux users have difficulties imagining how difficult it is to get used to a new system
[01:56] <ailean> gyaresu, i have reinstalled grub, but I get "NTLDR.exe cannot be found"
[01:56] <francix> therapy, what is BSD?
[01:56] <gyaresu> ailean, do you have the Hiren rescue disk?
[01:56] <Schalken> which linux-restricted-modules package do i need to download to install the nvidia drivers?
[01:57] <ailean> gyaresu, no, is that the best one? :)
[01:57] <Jewfro-Macabbi> francix, I recall my first linux experience, it took over a month to figure out how to install modem drivers...
[01:57] <TLE_02> !fglrx > TLE_02
[01:57] <therapy> francix : another unix-like os... like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD...
[01:57] <root_> is there a way i can set a user to log into a certain desktop session?
[01:57] <JosefK> aye Jewfro-Macabbi, it was similar for me until I discovered Debian
[01:57] <root_> crap
[01:57] <root_> brb
[01:58] <gyaresu> ailean, it has a ntldr fix which will get you into windows. or you can load the xp setup disk and FIXMBR or you can just get the ubuntu disk working and then write a correct grub line that will let you choose XP as an option.
[01:58] <netpython> !nvidia | Schalken
[01:58] <ubotu> Schalken: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:58] <josh_> ok back
[01:58] <francix> Jewfro-Macabbi,  the only reason i'm here now is that by some miracle the net is working without any installation, mounting, deblocking or any other abracadabra
[01:58] <josh_> say i want to have my kids log in on the edubuntu session... is there a config i can set that will automatically log them into that when they log in?
[01:59] <sikor_sxx> phenex: maybe you don"t have the required mp3 libs installed, do you hear system sound?
[01:59] <gyaresu> ailean, read up on the grub link from ubotu and get back with questions.
=== josh_ is now known as j2daosh
[01:59] <Jewfro-Macabbi> francix, I still have to keep an old windows box around, it's nothing but a net gateway, as I haven't the enery to make my bluetooth cell modem work
[01:59] <phenex> sikor_sxx, no, i don't... and why wouldn't they be installed? everything worked before i upgraded...
[01:59] <francix> Jewfro-Macabbi, haha bluetooth isn't easy even on windows i can imagine here :)
[01:59] <j2daosh> say i want to have my kids log in on the edubuntu session... is there a config i can set that will automatically log them into that when they log in?
[01:59] <chuckyp> ailean, basically you have 3 options getting 1) get grub working first   2) fixmbr then get grub working 3) fixmbr and try to use the windows boot.ini to launch grub.
[02:00] <chuckyp> ailean, option 1 probably being your easiest bet.
[02:00] <ailean> gyaresu, chuckyp, thanks :)
[02:00] <gyaresu> ailean, you got it?
[02:00] <Jewfro-Macabbi> francix, actually it was amazingly easy on Windows, install the dongle, driver, and use the "add new net connection" wizard, done....
[02:00] <ailean> gyaresu, phone rang...
[02:00] <sikor_sxx> phenex: updated packages may have removed mp3 support, because of license issues
[02:00] <Haitao> well I am back. For some reason the applet does not appear on the panel at all
[02:01] <Haitao> (the disk mount panel)
[02:01] <francix> Jewfro-Macabbi, for a windows user, to install stuff is not easy, we're used to plug and play
[02:01] <chuckyp> Jewfro-Macabbi, can't you use nix for your bluetooth cell modem?
[02:01] <gyaresu> j2daosh, did you peruse the edubuntu "GettingStarted" page?
[02:01] <Jewfro-Macabbi> chuckyp, It can be done, I tried once, I failed
[02:01] <Haitao> what package is the graphical disk mount based on?
[02:02] <chuckyp> Jewfro-Macabbi, ahh...  I know bluetooth support has improved with edgy.
[02:02] <gyaresu> chuckyp, Jewfro-Macabbi It is a bit annoying. And I'm used to things needing to be built in Linux.
[02:02] <francix> yes it's weird , before ubuntu got patched (or upgraded dunno what you call it) i had a program called totem, now  it's gone
[02:02] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:02] <phenex> sikor_sxx, i don't think they did... at least  i didn't see anything like that in packages to remove before the upgrade...
[02:02] <j2daosh> nope, i know how to use it... i just wanted only the kids to get edubuntu... but now that i think about it... i cant... it will show them everything just like my ubuntu/kubuntu applications plus the edubuntu apps that just installed
[02:02] <j2daosh> so nevermind
[02:02] <Jewfro-Macabbi> francix, I'm used to installing stuff on windows, and removing stuff, and reinstalling widows, removing the viri and spywares... It pays my bills, in fact :)
[02:02] <defrysk> :D
[02:02] <chuckyp> j2daosh, you could edit their menus and make them guest accounts.
[02:02] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:02] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:02] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:03] <k1piee> Hello
[02:03] <rsteele> sup?
[02:03] <Jewfro-Macabbi> gyaresu, I may try again later, but the old windows box works fine as a gateway, so it's not pressing
[02:03] <gyaresu> j2daosh, you could hack it up...
[02:03] <Softly> sup?
[02:03] <francix> Jewfro-Macabbi, tell me about it, windows is like a streetgirl, she is easy but full of diseases
[02:03] <defrysk> francix, and has many holes
[02:04] <j2daosh> i could... and i probably will...
[02:04] <defrysk> to use
[02:04] <Jewfro-Macabbi> francix, hide and disable IE, install symantec corparate AV, adaware pro, and fugget about it
[02:04] <j2daosh> i was just hoping for an easy way ;)
[02:04] <gyaresu> now now. language && context people.
[02:04] <defrysk> symantec sucs
[02:04] <sikor_sxx> phenex: namely which app wont play sound?
[02:04] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:04] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!
[02:04] <mende> lol! jews did wtc!!

[02:06] <gyaresu> Haitao, does it have to be GUI?

[02:13] <perestroika> ok cool. can you tell me how to install amorak please?
[02:14] <scyth> is it possible (easy) to install full ubuntu version of gnome, after kubuntu installation ?
[02:14] <defrysk> sudo aspt-get install amarok
[02:14] <chuckyp> perestroika, sudo aptitude install amarok
[02:14] <gyaresu> perestroika, 'apt-get install amarok'
[02:14] <chuckyp> scyth, yes
[02:14] <perestroika> thanks
[02:14] <chuckyp> scyth, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[02:14] <gyaresu> chuckyp, defrysk and it's chuckyp with the sudo and correct spelling for the win.
[02:14] <defrysk> lol gyaresu
[02:15] <GameCat> hi - can someone advise me on how to request an update to a package when an upstream version is released?
[02:15] <goara> what do i need to do to get java runtime version 5 update 9 working for my firefox?
[02:15] <Bubble> !themes
[02:15] <ubotu> Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://kdelook.org - http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/58/ - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[02:15] <drarem> i have the kommander dialog editor, but what c++ ide do i use with it
[02:15] <gyaresu> GameCat, Yes. Don't.
[02:15] <chuckyp> !java > goara
[02:15] <goara> !java
[02:15] <defrysk> GameCat the packages are frozen , no updates
[02:15] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[02:15] <francix> my comp is dual boot, part of the hd is linux ,rest in winxp, is it possible to transfer files from the xp part to the linux part?
[02:16] <gyaresu> goara, do you have the sun java installed and the -plugin?
[02:16] <TLE_02> raghu206: I don't know all of the differences. I imagine it starts up with only the bare essentials to allow you to trouble shoot problems, but one specific difference is that recovery mode thats up without X, so just straight to a console
[02:16] <GameCat> gyaresu: defrysk : so my only option is to build it myself?
[02:16] <goara> i downloaded the java from the sun website i think it is
[02:16] <goara> the self extracting binary
[02:16] <chuckyp> gyaresu, I believe the sun-java5-fre installs the plugin automatically.
[02:16] <gyaresu> GameCat, Download the source and get jiggy.
[02:16] <goara> and did sh thebinary
[02:16] <defrysk> GameCat, what do you want to build ?
[02:17] <GameCat> defrysk: mpd http://musicpd.org
[02:17] <goara> not the plugin though i guess
[02:17] <gyaresu> chuckyp, Ah. That would account for my lack of effort in that arena.
[02:17] <goara> -.-
[02:17] <raghu206> TLE_02, thnks
[02:17] <gyaresu> goara, apt is your friend.
[02:17] <chuckyp> gyaresu, maybe not.. hrm... chekcing the wiki
[02:17] <gyaresu> goara, 'apt-cache search sun-java5
[02:18] <Hobbsee> hmmm.  no ops call yet.
[02:18] <therapy> francix : Y's
[02:18] <therapy> francix : Yes
[02:18] <j2daosh> lol i can fix that Hobbsee
[02:18] <gyaresu> Hobbsee, Yeah well when you smell that bad... :D
[02:18] <Hobbsee> haha
[02:18] <defrysk> GameCat, try the .debs from the downloadsection : http://musicpd.org/~decklin/debian/
[02:18] <Hobbsee> j2daosh: dont you dare :p
[02:18] <chuckyp> ` or 1=1--
[02:18] <defrysk> GameCat, they might work
[02:19] <francix> therapy, advanced user stuff? or is it pretty easy?
[02:19] <josh_> okay... /quit and /leave aren't the same thing :P
[02:19] <goara> thx @ gyaresu: aint gettin it that way but thanks for the help first of
[02:19] <GameCat> defrysk: use dpkg to install, yes?
[02:19] <gyaresu> goara, no problem.
[02:19] <defrysk> GameCat, sudo dpkg -i <package>
[02:19] <therapy> francix : i find it pretty simple /)
[02:19] <GameCat> defrysk: triff, thanks I'll try it
[02:19] <josh_> anyone got a site on locking down a childs account on this thing
[02:19] <chuckyp> GameCat, or gdebi  if you just double click the .deb
[02:19] <defrysk> GameCat, if it fails due to deps do sudo apt-get - f install
[02:19] <defrysk> GameCat, if it fails due to deps do sudo apt-get -f install
[02:20] <defrysk> sorry
[02:20] <josh_> i dont want to get all but one thing and have him undo it all
[02:20] <chuckyp> josh_, like internet etc...?
[02:20] <GameCat> defrysk: no worries
[02:20] <gyaresu> josh_, locking down?
[02:20] <josh_> internet, applications, the whole shebang
[02:20] <francix> therapy, mounting the windows partition in a certain way right?
[02:20] <GameCat> chuckyp: thanks, but this is a headless  server with no X
[02:21] <josh_> lol the only thing i can find about locking down a kids account is on windows
[02:21] <josh_> 90 percent of the webpages i have seen are only for window
[02:21] <josh_> thats sad... :P
[02:21] <voluspa> raghu206: According to /boot/grub/menu.lst it is a single session. Traditionally it means root, with no network and no other users, but you'll have to look at the rules for single to be sure.
[02:22] <francix> therapy, cause right now i can't even open it, my bet is that it isn't mounted right
[02:22] <therapy> francix if it is not allready mounted
[02:22] <chuckyp> josh_, hrm.. perhaps ask in the forums.
[02:22] <defrysk> GameCat, it does not work
[02:22] <josh_> lol ill bug Hobbsee :P
[02:22] <GameCat> ah well :/
[02:22] <defrysk> GameCat, you need to compile

[02:22] <gyaresu> josh_, I reckon you should just remove menu items.
[02:22] <GameCat> defrysk: thanks for trying - the help is appreciated
[02:23] <drarem> i installed KDevelop, it's showing in my add remove program list as checked, but where teh heck is it on my menu?  It's not in develop
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[02:23] <defrysk> GameCat, easyest is to do sudo apt-get build-dep mpd
[02:23] <chuckyp> josh_, I found a howto http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=226298&highlight=parental
[02:23] <mari1> hi all
[02:23] <chuckyp> Hobbsee, what'd he do?
[02:23] <defrysk> GameCat,  and then compile the sources
[02:23] <mari1> i talk from italy(modena)
[02:23] <drarem> oh maybe i need to relog back in
[02:23] <linux01> hi everyone
[02:23] <drarem> doh
[02:23] <defrysk> GameCat,  and do checkinstall in stead of make install
[02:24] <francix> therapy, it probably is , kind of illogical since i can't open it the way it is mounted anyway
[02:24] <Hobbsee> chuckyp: i was committing op abuse :P  he highlighted me..and iv'e had to kick many people today
[02:24] <defrysk> GameCat, it makes a .deb for you then
[02:24] <chuckyp> Hobbsee, for highlighting you?
[02:24] <therapy> francix , what is in the /media directory
[02:24] <GameCat> defrysk: how does apt-get know what the deps are for a source package? do I need to unpack it somewhere specific?
[02:24] <gyaresu> chuckyp, I believe it was humour.
[02:24] <chuckyp> Hobbsee, can yous ee if you can send him a message with the link for him.
[02:24] <Hobbsee> chuckyp: for mentioning my nick.  just when it was getting all peaceful in here :P
[02:24] <josh_> lol
[02:24] <Hobbsee> chuckyp: i've invited him back, a while ago.  there he is
[02:25] <chuckyp> josh_, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=226298&highlight=parental
[02:25] <chuckyp> josh_, that is the link.
[02:25] <defrysk> GameCat, you can uncomment the src-deb blablah in your sources.list
[02:25] <francix> cdrom0,1 and sda1
[02:25] <josh_> yeah i got your link chuck, thank you
[02:25] <defrysk> GameCat, then it also can install the dep for compiling your package
[02:25] <defrysk> deps*
[02:25] <niktaris> where can I find the artwork of the ubuntu live cd. (bootsplash etc)
[02:25] <TLE_02> josh_: I'm not entirely sure I understand, but I imagine that you want to restrict the account. I imagine that the edubuntu has some tools for that maybe you should have a look at how they do it
[02:26] <defrysk> GameCat, you need to install build-essential and checkinstall also
[02:26] <francix> therapy, sda1 i imagine is a harddisc , but nothing inside
[02:26] <GameCat> defrysk: I'm making notes :)
[02:26] <chuckyp> That is something that really needs to be worked on a parental control software for ubuntu
[02:26] <defrysk> GameCat, keep making them ;)
[02:26] <chuckyp> Alright folks i'm off to bed.
[02:27] <TLE_02> chuckyp: Ahhh what kind of parental control ?
[02:27] <defrysk> chuckyp, best parental control is a parent

[02:28] <GameCat> right
[02:29] <j50k> an what's with the flowers??
[02:29] <defrysk> GameCat, but if the boxes are alike in os it should be ok
[02:29] <TLE_02> chuckyp: I mean you can already decide who gets to use what programs, and as far as resticting web usage. Well firts of all I suppose that is a browser issue, and I don't even think the technology is here yet to make a filter work really good
[02:29] <francix> gyaresu, hehe yeah
[02:29] <GameCat> defrysk: both are 6.06 boxes
[02:29] <chuckyp> TLE_02, yeah software is there to do it.
[02:29] <GameCat> defrysk: so i may as well try it :)
[02:29] <defrysk> GameCat, should be ok then
[02:29] <francix> j50k, i know some sites if you want to know more about "flowers" arf arf!

[02:30] <Fastly> i installed postfix and would like to allow php to send email from this computer
[02:30] <Fastly> currently i have "sendmail_path = sendmail -t -i"
[02:31] <Fastly> in php.ini
[02:31] <Schalken> When I do "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" it says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver!" How can I fix this?
[02:31] <Trainstroker> how can i get a text dump of a file in ubuntu?
[02:31] <francix> btw is it true that the new ubuntu has problems with usb2.0?
[02:31] <loutrine> Trainstroker: Define 'dump'
[02:31] <defrysk> Schalken, its nvidia-xconfig
[02:31] <TLE_02> chuckyp: What I mean if it works by scanning text and looking for "bad" words, I don't suppose it'll ever really work better than spam filters for email, then you could make a list a "no no" places but that's hopeless. And the last options is to make a tool that can recognise certain object in pictures. I have heard of such a tool being developed, but not anywhere near complete
[02:31] <Schalken> Trainstroker: cat
[02:31] <defrysk> Schalken, same script , new name
[02:32] <Schalken> Trainstroker: cat >file
[02:32] <Trainstroker> loutrine: when u hex edit a file there are words on the side. i want a text file w. those words w.o the seperators or whatnot
[02:32] <goara> what exactly are the edgy plf packages? what do they conclude?
[02:32] <ericmaass> good morning, I am new to linux and unix, I have installed a duel boot with ubuntu and windows, I am trying to install Solaris 10 is anyone here able to offer some assistance, #solaris is not helping
[02:32] <chuckyp> TLE_02, yeah you can filter out words blocking pages.
[02:33] <Schalken> defrysk: cool, now do i have to logout/in or reboot?
[02:33] <francix> hobbsee, you haven't kicked anyone in a while! are you allright??
[02:33] <defrysk> Schalken, restart x
[02:33] <defrysk> thats all
[02:33] <chuckyp> TLE_02, the best bet is to not let them use the net at all or just monitor it.  But there is plenty of software for windows locking it down.
[02:33] <GameCat> Trainstroker: try looking at "strings"
[02:33] <chuckyp> TLE_02, Where there is very little software for linux to do it.
[02:34] <chuckyp> TLE_02, anyhow I need sleepy
[02:34] <chuckyp> l8ters people
[02:34] <webben> goara, they include non-free packages that may have dodgy licencing. But note that the repository is no longer maintained for Ubuntu.

[02:35] <Hobbsee> hey fabbione
[02:35] <Hobbsee> francix: :D
[02:35] <francix> you had me worry there
[02:35] <Schalken> defrysk: you beauty! someone should really update the wiki...i was trying to figure that one out for a good few hours :(
[02:35] <GameCat> Trainstroker: it's in the package binutils in case it's not already on your machine
[02:36] <fabbione> hi Hobbsee
[02:36] <Fastly> anyone here using the sendmail wrapper for postfix to send email from php?
[02:36] <Trainstroker> gamecat: h.o im foolin around w. cat
[02:36] <goara> webben thx
[02:36] <tez1985> hi guys, I'm trying to install my wireless USB adapter everytime I modprobe ndiswrapper it says "Module Ndiswrapper not found"
[02:37] <GameCat> Trainstroker: honestly, you want strings - from the man page: "strings - print the strings of printable characters in files." - much simpler than cat/sed whatever
[02:37] <francix> it can't find it
[02:38] <Jahman> hi
[02:38] <francix> ask me for help! most of it will be useless!
[02:38] <splintax> okay
[02:38] <splintax> let's say i got sick of using ubuntu
[02:38] <splintax> which i probably will when i become too leet for it
[02:38] <joolsr> hi all
[02:38] <splintax> how difficult is it to 'convert' to a new distro?
[02:39] <francix> just use another spectro... i meant distro
[02:39] <defrysk> splintax, go to #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:39] <splintax> defrysk: why..?
[02:39] <tez1985> anyone help me with wireless problems?
[02:39] <Fastly> anyone here using the sendmail wrapper for postfix to send email from php?
[02:39] <defrysk> splintax, you are off topic
[02:39] <Able>  8-)
[02:39] <splintax> defrysk: i'm talking about transferring out of ubuntu.. that's still to do with ubuntu, right?
[02:40] <defrysk> splintax, als that discussion would be off topic
[02:40] <LGKeiz> sure is active at 7:40AM in the morning, Im off to school, late
[02:40] <defrysk> also*
[02:40] <splintax> defrysk: okay then
[02:40] <joolsr> I have a weird one, a user here cannot cahnge a single letter on a folder or title without getting a 'Please correct the indicated errors.' but there are none, and it doesnt say what the errors are. Using Plone 2.1.3
[02:40] <joolsr> but I can cahnge the folder ok .....
[02:41] <joolsr> she has owner permissions, same as me ... and we've had thsi same issue before sporadically every few weeks in a random way ..
[02:41] <Trainstroker> gamecat: is strings an app? i didnt find it in my repo's
[02:41] <Jewfro-Macabbi> splintax, if you become truly l33t, you'll understand linux is linux :)
[02:41] <GameCat> Trainstroker: it's in the package binutils in case it's not already on your machine
[02:42] <joolsr> at least i'm talking about Plone ;-)
[02:42] <Able> is it true that mepis 6.0 is based on Ubuntu?
[02:42] <joolsr> yepp
[02:42] <defrysk> yes
[02:42] <splintax> Jewfro-Macabbi: was that a serious answer? i realise the similarities between linux distros... i'm just wondering how difficult it is to transfer between them
[02:42] <compudaze> which is based on debian
[02:42] <Trainstroker> gamecat: where is the output?
[02:42] <splintax> Jewfro-Macabbi: like if it's just a matter of copying my home dir or what
[02:42] <GameCat> Trainstroker: try 'which strings' and if it's not there 'sudo apt-get install binutils'
[02:43] <joolsr> ah ., hang on, i'm on the wrong chan ... duh !!
[02:43] <joolsr> bye
[02:43] <Trainstroker> gamecat: i have the command installed im jw where the output oes
[02:43] <Jewfro-Macabbi> splintax, that was a serious answer. Naturally, back up any files you want saved before you reformat your hard drive :)
[02:43] <allison_1984> Hi, can anybody help me with xmms ?..everytime I try to play a song it says to check my sound card...it never happened before
[02:43] <Able> has anyone tried Mepis 6.0 recently and what do they think of it?
[02:44] <GameCat> Trainstroker: try 'strings -a <filename>|less'
[02:44] <defrysk> allison_1984, check in prefs of xmms if output is set on esd or alsa
[02:44] <Jewfro-Macabbi> Able, yes, nvidia driver breaks a lot
[02:44] <Smotang> Hey does anyone know if there is any program for linux that allows you to use and connect to ventrilo servers?
[02:45] <defrysk> allison_1984, if its on arts change it to esd or alsa
[02:45] <Trainstroker> gamecat: i got a bunch of tildas on my screen
[02:45] <GameCat> then strings hasn't found anything
[02:45] <Able> oh
[02:45] <allison_1984> defrysk, its on OSS,
[02:45] <defrysk> allison_1984, try esd
[02:45] <Trainstroker> is there an app that can do this gamecat?
[02:45] <defrysk> allison_1984, if no go try alsa
[02:45] <GameCat> Trainstroker: what kind of file is it?
[02:46] <Trainstroker> bin
[02:46] <GameCat> Trainstroker: as in file.bin?
[02:46] <Trainstroker> yrer
[02:46] <Trainstroker> yeah*
[02:46] <allison_1984> defrysk, thanks..it works, can I bug you with another question ? :)
[02:46] <Smotang> Hey does anyone know if there is any program for linux that allows you to use and connect to ventrilo servers?
[02:47] <defrysk> allison_1984, sjoer
[02:47] <GameCat> Trainstroker: that could be all manner of things, most common being either c CD image or a compressed installer - in both cases you would be unlikely to find any strings - are you sure there is anything to find?
[02:47] <Trainstroker> yeah in the a hex editor there is text
=== bjkbkj is now known as sby_fitnes_diran
[02:48] <francix> Smotang, nothing which could help you on the ventrilo website? about using it under linux?

[02:48] <Trainstroker> yeah in the a hex editor there is text gamecat
[02:48] <compudaze> need wine/cedega for it
[02:48] <GameCat> Trainstroker: in that case, I can't help, sorry
[02:48] <Trainstroker> hmm ok thanks gamecat
[02:48] <defrysk> zOap, evil solution might be opera
[02:48] <allison_1984> defrysk, since I have upgraded to dapper, many applications are working very erratic, can you also help me with either oKle and ogle..they don't work now
[02:48] <francix> what's evil about opera?
[02:49] <defrysk> allison_1984, I never worked with ogle unfortunately
[02:49] <zOap> defrysk, well, even though I'm norwegian I don't fancy it that much..
[02:49] <defrysk> francix, closed source
[02:49] <francix> aaah ok
[02:49] <zaikxtox> hello. sorry for buggin but i'm somewhat dissappointed. how does the ubuntu "generic" kernel works? i mean, one size fits all? smp / one processor? em64t / amd64 ?
[02:49] <allison_1984> defrysk, what media player you use ? I have vlc too, but it does not play dvds
[02:50] <compudaze> zaikxtox, it works, just use it, dont like it? compile your own kernel
[02:50] <defrysk> allison_1984, I use edgy now and play cd on totem
[02:50] <zaikxtox> or there is one "generic" kernel and avery other optimization must be done by compiling a vanilla kernel.
[02:50] <francix> linux can't play dvd (legally at least) i thnk
[02:50] <defrysk> allison_1984, seveas has made a repository containing packages for dvd play support
[02:50] <compudaze> francix, you are wrong
[02:50] <zaikxtox> compudaze, no, i'm just learning. maybe ubuntu recognizes your proc. features and downloads the right kernel under the "generic" metapackage
[02:51] <allison_1984> defrysk, I am even intimidated to try to upgrade to edgy....too much work to tweak things back to working mode after upgrade
[02:51] <allison_1984> ok cool
[02:51] <defrysk> allison_1984, for dapper http://seveas.imbrandon.com/dists/dapper-seveas/
[02:51] <francix> i thought dvd was closed media or something
[02:51] <compudaze> you can play dvd's legaly if you buy dvd playback software (just like you would have to in windows) -- lindvd (from the makers of windvd)
[02:51] <defrysk> allison_1984, make sure to read the instructions
[02:51] <francix> aaah ok

Everytime i try to startx by typing in on the full screen console "startx" on the command line, it's trying to load the x but it seems like it doesn't want to because of my graphics card. I get this fatal error about unknown 0 or something. Please help on how to make my graphics card work on my Kubuntu. Thanks.
[02:52] <compudaze> zaikxtox, no it doesn't work like that, there are now only 3 kernels for x86 pc's - 386, generic, server
[02:52] <compudaze> generic is got 686+ pc's
[02:52] <compudaze> got=for
[02:52] <variant> Soldier1991: why do you not use kdm ?
[02:52] <Soldier1991> I tried it.
[02:52] <variant> Soldier1991: try /etc/init.d/kdm start
[02:52] <Soldier1991> Wait, I installed KDM.
[02:52] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, can you paste your X error log (located in /var/log) in a pastebin please?
[02:52] <peter_> someone please help me enter graphical mode on ubuntu
[02:52] <variant> Soldier1991: it comes as default with kubuntu
[02:52] <allison_1984> ironically, I have a dual boot, the dvds I could not even read in windoze used to read in a ziffy in ubuntu
[02:52] <zaikxtox> ok , thanks. i had no problem with it, but just learning because on debian used to have a lot of kernels :)
[02:52] <zaikxtox> thanks again
[02:53] <Soldier1991> I'm on windows right now.
[02:53] <Soldier1991> And I cannot gt acceess to the GUI.
[02:53] <francix> do not speak to soldier he is unclean :)
[02:53] <compudaze> zaikxtox, theres just not a big difference for a kernel compiled for 686 or k7, p4, etc
[02:53] <Soldier1991> Or the KDE desktop.
[02:53] <Able>  :D
[02:53] <defrysk> zOap, epiphany-browser might be it for you
[02:53] <variant> Soldier1991: you dont need access to the gui to use irc or paste the erorrs
[02:53] <zaikxtox> compudaze, no. the big thing comes on SMP / one proc.
[02:53] <variant> Soldier1991: reboot and log int o the command line, type irssi (its a command line irc client)
[02:54] <edgy> Hi, /etc/init.d/apache2 restart gave nothing. ps aux doesn't display any apache process. the log files are blank how can I troubleshoot this?
[02:54] <zaikxtox> compudaze, anyway, compiling kernels is not black magin anymore :)
[02:54] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, you can try changing the graphics driver to vesa and see if that at least gets your foot in the door
=== Sby_Fitnes_Diran is now known as Sby_Fitnes_DiRan
[02:54] <zaikxtox> i go then. thanks
[02:54] <defrysk> any vidcard does vesa
[02:54] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, once you're in, you can see the logs and paste them online
[02:56] <whyme> hi all
[02:56] <Soldier1991> But How do i join this chat by that command line irc?
=== pc3 is now known as D-X_X-D
[02:56] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, you can do that but you wont be able to paste
[02:56] <plod> sudo apt-get install irc
[02:56] <compudaze> type /join #ubuntu
[02:56] <compudaze> Soldier1991, install irssi
[02:56] <Soldier1991> but what if i want to scroll up and see the error?
[02:56] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, irssi should be installed by default
[02:57] <jrib> Soldier1991: use irssi inside screen
[02:57] <Soldier1991> So i just type in "irssi"?
[02:57] <Soldier1991> Nothing else?
[02:57] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, but like i said, you'll need a graphical web browser to paste the error... if you want to just see it, you can do that with either cat <log> |more or vi
[02:57] <compudaze> type, irssi --help
[02:58] <Soldier1991> Oay.
[02:58] <Soldier1991> Okay.
[02:58] <jrib> Soldier1991: easiest way may be to save teh error to a file and then paste it into #flood
[02:58] <Soldier1991> I cannot use the mouse.
[02:58] <compudaze> u can install gpm for console mouse support
[02:58] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, i suggest you replace the video driver by vesa
[02:58] <Soldier1991> How?
[02:59] <jrib> Soldier1991: /exec cat /path/to/my/saved/file   for example (Don't issue this command here, do it in #flood after asking some people to join)
[02:59] <Soldier1991> Hiow?
[02:59] <compudaze> sudo aptitude install gpm
[02:59] <Soldier1991> Will i be able to copy and paste with the gpm?
[02:59] <variant> Soldier1991: yup
[02:59] <Soldier1991> K.
[02:59] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, under Section Device, under Driver, replace whatever you have there with "vesa"
[03:00] <Soldier1991> In the command line?
[03:00] <Soldier1991> I don't kniow how to access it with the command line.
[03:00] <variant> Soldier1991: to copy paste in gpm, highlight the text and simply middle click to paste it
[03:00] <Soldier1991> Is it CD?
[03:00] <defrysk> maybe sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg could do the trick ?
[03:00] <defrysk> to fix x
[03:00] <variant> Soldier1991: nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:00] <Soldier1991> I tried that.
[03:01] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, then choose vesa as the driver
[03:01] <defrysk> Soldier1991, you did an upgrade to edgy or something ?
[03:01] <Soldier1991> No.
[03:01] <Soldier1991> I just installed Kubuntu.
[03:02] <defrysk> ok
[03:02] <Soldier1991> And i got this error everytime i try to startx.
[03:02] <defrysk> just wondering
[03:02] <Soldier1991> Even in the live ubuntu cd.
[03:02] <defrysk> probably a new pc ?
[03:02] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, what video card do you have again?
[03:02] <Soldier1991> ati radeon 9250
[03:02] <Soldier1991> supported with sapphire
[03:02] <Soldier1991> powered w/e
[03:02] <Soldier1991> lol.
[03:03] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, plz try the vesa driver
[03:03] <Soldier1991> Will i work?
[03:03] <Trentster> hey all, I am trying to get aiglx running, ive got a nvidia card, and when I install the beta nvidia drivers , it also changes the kernel version to a version that does not support smp processors , so my core 2 cpu comes up as a single processor, also the other problem is that the beta nvidia drivers wont display 1440 x 900 resolution for my 19" panel........any ideas if there are ways to solve any of these problems....?
[03:03] <defrysk> probably does not recognize your motherboard or something
[03:03] <Soldier1991> ir***
[03:03] <pppoe_dude> coz i think you need to get proprietary ati drivers
[03:03] <Soldier1991> the vesa drigvers are the drivers for ati?
[03:03] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, vesa should work... they are generic and should work for any video card
[03:03] <defrysk> vesa is driver for all video cards
[03:03] <Soldier1991> But what about the rest of the settings?
[03:04] <secureboot> anyone know why rhythmbox would be unable to get music from iTunes music shares?  I'm stuck on "Retrieving songs from music share"
[03:04] <Soldier1991> Leave it as defeaut?
[03:04] <Soldier1991> Defauilt.
[03:04] <defrysk> Soldier1991, for now yes
[03:04] <Soldier1991> Alright.
[03:04] <Soldier1991> I'll be right back

[03:06] <variant> Trentster: use a card that supports free software :D
[03:06] <frederick85> I can't get azureus to work on Ubuntu yet it works fine on my windows partition
[03:07] <Bluetooth> Xserver doesn't start after adding some lines to xorg.conf
[03:07] <pppoe_dude> frederick85, did you install sun java?

[03:07] <frederick85> pppoe_dude: starts fine doesn't connect to peers though
[03:07] <variant> frederick85: what problem is it?
[03:07] <pppoe_dude> frederick85, did you forward ports if behind firewall?
[03:07] <Trentster> variant, like what?
[03:08] <Jewfro-Macabbi> defrysk, are these good instructions for setting up stunnel: http://deb.riseup.net/desktop/dircproxy/?
[03:08] <frederick85> variant: doesn't connect to peers

[03:08] <Bluetooth> right here?
[03:08] <jrib> !pastebin | Bluetooth
[03:08] <ubotu> Bluetooth: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[03:08] <variant> Trentster: radeon 9250
[03:08] <frederick85> pppod_dude: i didn't do anything about fowarding ports, not sure how i can do it
[03:08] <variant> frederick85: sounds like a firewall issue, do you ahve firestarter or somthing installed?
[03:08] <edgy> Hi, /etc/init.d/apache2 restart says nothing. ps aux doesn't display any apache process running. the error log is blank, how can I troubleshoot this?
[03:09] <defrysk> Jewfro-Macabbi, I have no knowledge about stunnel, sorry
[03:09] <frederick85> variant: yes I have firestarter installed
[03:09] <variant> edgy: /etc/init.d/apache2 start && ps aux | grep apache
[03:09] <Jewfro-Macabbi> anyone else running stunnel?
[03:09] <variant> frederick85: that is why you cannot connect to peers, open the firestarter giu and open up the bittorrent ports
[03:09] <variant> gui*
[03:09] <defrysk>  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop ;  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
[03:10] <edgy> variant: nothing except the grep apache process
[03:10] <Soldier1991> Alright.
[03:10] <compudaze> look in /var/log/apache2/error.log
[03:10] <Bluetooth> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30525/
[03:10] <Soldier1991> I'm on my KDE desktop.
[03:10] <Soldier1991> Thanks.
[03:10] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, w/ vesa?
[03:10] <variant> edgy: try just running apache
[03:10] <Soldier1991> Yes.
[03:11] <defrysk> Soldier1991, doe you have an on board videocard ?
[03:11] <Soldier1991> Yup.
[03:11] <edgy> defrysk: the stop says ok but the start says nothing
[03:11] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, now google for your video card + ubuntu or linux
[03:11] <frederick85> variant: not sure how to open the port am I?
[03:11] <edgy> compudaze: it's blank
[03:11] <Soldier1991> How do I go on irc as soldier1991 not root?
[03:11] <defrysk>  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
[03:11] <defrysk> try that
[03:11] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, /set
[03:11] <Soldier1991> On what?
[03:11] <mamzers555> hello, i need help with mounting a encrypted partition
[03:12] <variant> Soldier1991: you should avoid loggin into irc as root
[03:12] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, on irssi, type /set, then it will show you the name, hostname, etc.
[03:12] <pppoe_dude> Soldier1991, plus what variant said
[03:12] <jrib> Soldier1991: don't execute your client with sudo or as root
[03:12] <Soldier1991> k.
[03:12] <variant> Soldier1991: you should not be logged in to your computer as root at all unless your performing some administration
[03:12] <Soldier1991> But I'm on the desktop.
[03:12] <defrysk> Soldier1991, and are you using another videocard or just the onboard videocard ?
[03:12] <Soldier1991> How do I take it off root?
[03:12] <Bluetooth> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30526/
[03:12] <Soldier1991> I'm using my graphics card.
[03:12] <variant> Soldier1991: did you run sudo passd
[03:12] <Soldier1991> I think.
[03:12] <variant> Soldier1991: did you run sudo passwd?
[03:13] <Soldier1991> No.
[03:13] <variant> Soldier1991: in a terminal type "whoami"
[03:13] <thiagoarrais> can I disable the shift-bkspc shortcut to avoid killing the X server?
[03:13] <Bluetooth> just wanted to use auxillary buttons on my mouse
[03:13] <Soldier1991> I am root
[03:13] <jrib> Bluetooth: what kind of mouse by the way?
[03:13] <variant> thiagoarrais: yeah Option "nozap" iirc
[03:13] <Soldier1991> It said root.
[03:13] <Bluetooth> Logitech Cordless Click! mouse
[03:13] <defrysk> Soldier1991, if you use another videocard then the onboard card you should turn off the onboard videocard in your bios for proper detection
[03:13] <Bluetooth> optical, wireless
[03:13] <variant> Soldier1991: you should set up a user account with the useradd command and use hat instead
[03:13] <thiagoarrais> variant: where do I enter that?
[03:14] <jrib> Bluetooth: MS?
[03:14] <Soldier1991> How?
[03:14] <Bluetooth> Logitecj
[03:14] <variant> thiagoarrais: in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[03:19] <mu1> can i revert it
[03:19] <mu1> pls tell
[03:19] <_bt> did you use visudo ?
[03:19] <mu1> no
[03:19] <mu1> studied man sudo
[03:19] <mu1> and made it
[03:20] <_bt> now you cant get in to change it

[03:20] <jrib> Bluetooth: yes, but you also have multiple sections for your mouse in your xorg.conf.  You should use only one and make sure you fix up "ServerLayout" section to match what you did above
[03:20] <Bluetooth> yeah

[03:21] <krimeenal> I pretty much have no clue how to do anythin technical in Linux, so can someone patient enough break it down for me.
[03:21] <jrib> Bluetooth: the best way imo, is for you to use the "configured mouse1" one.  You don't need a udev rule to create event9 if you just match with "Name".  Get rid of "phys", you don't need it
[03:21] <jlow> dear god .. you people need to get familiar with google
[03:21] <wiscalico> linux01, what do you mean by not working?
[03:21] <mu1> _bt: surely cant change?
[03:21] <jlow> here.. i'll post the link
[03:21] <jlow> www.google.com
[03:21] <krimeenal> lol
[03:22] <Bluetooth> ok
[03:22] <linux01> when i insert the card in the reader it doesn't get recognized
[03:22] <Bluetooth> i'll try to

[03:22] <jrib> Bluetooth: cat /proc/bus/input/devices   to get the right name
[03:22] <bluezy> jlow, well, I tried finding it in google and could not do it.  I guess I am stupid.
[03:22] <_bt> mul boot up in single user mode and chmod the sudoers file to 440 also edit it to correct your mistakes
[03:22] <dan__> oops
[03:22] <wiscalico> what kind of SD reader do you have?
[03:22] <linux01> its built in im not sure what kind or who its made by
[03:23] <wiscalico> try run lspci from a terminal
[03:23] <jrib> Bluetooth: get rid of device as well as phys, just match with "name"
[03:23] <Bluetooth> ok
[03:23] <wiscalico> what size is your SD card?
[03:23] <mu1> pls tell me is it possible to change sudoers list
[03:23] <linux01> 1 gb
[03:23] <mu1> ?
[03:23] <bluezy> I guess nobody has an immediate idea on how to do it...  Well, google, I am going to give you another try, come here so I can spank you...

[03:24] <anders9034> anyone here know how to set up joystick with linux? i want to use my joystick with e-uae. should i set up the joystick (connected to the game port of the mobo) in xorg.conf or is there some other way?
[03:24] <mu1> bluezy how?
[03:24] <pty> _3uG_: only one way to find out :)
[03:24] <mu1> im new to linux
[03:24] <jrib> Bluetooth: I use https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MX1000Mouse for my mx1000, you can try reading it to get an idea (the dapper instructions work for edgy too)

[03:25] <jrib> Soldier1991: log in where?  at kdm?
[03:25] <Soldier1991> Yes.
[03:25] <mu1> no permission for me
[03:25] <pty> _3uG_: yeh that could be nasty.  if you try it in synaptic it should pop up a confirmation box first - you can check in there
[03:25] <variant> Soldier1991: instead of typeing root and the password type the username and the password that you created
[03:25] <wiscalico> your problem might be that there is no support for SD cards < 512MB yet
[03:25] <_3uG_> pty, oh yeah! sheesh.. i always forget about synaptic
[03:26] <Soldier1991> I can't enter the username or passwor dbecause it sends me directly to the desktop.
[03:26] <wiscalico> not 100%... I myself is hit by bug #61758 try take a look on it in launchpad.net
[03:26] <GameCat> anyway, I'm off - thanks for the advice guys
[03:26] <linux01> oh ok thanks
[03:26] <linux01> i been going crazy trying to figure it out or get some help

[03:53] <Emess> i suppose, although edgy sinit terribly stable either
[03:53] <peter_> ANYONE who has installed vmware on Ubuntu 6.10??
[03:53] <compudaze> i have 0 stability problems with it, depends on what u do, how u do it and what u do it with

[03:57] <mgedmin> when you install Dapper from the live CD, and want to resize the existing NTFS partition, it asks for "new partition size"
[03:57] <mgedmin> does anyone know if it is the "new (partition size [of the current NTFS] )", or "(new partition [that will be created for Dapper] ) size"?
[03:57] <variant> peter_: my advice is to use qemu with the kqemu closed source accelerator
[03:58] <lupine_85> mgedmin: it's the size of the new partition, IIRC
[03:58] <lupine_85> HOWEVER, you might want to think twice before allowing the install CD to resize your ntfs partition
[03:58] <variant> peter_: instead of vmware
[03:58] <lupine_85> I've known it to kill several partitions
[03:58] <compudaze> peter_, what errors?
[03:58] <variant> compudaze: he has the wrong kernel headers installed
[03:59] <mgedmin> nah, thinkpads have that rescue partition that can reinstall windows
[03:59] <peter_> variant: is qemu complicated? youre talking to a newbee =)
[03:59] <peter_> compudaze: I can check again w8
[04:00] <variant> peter_: to be honest, it is less confusing than the absurd vmware setup script
[04:00] <variant> peter_: i use it to run windows server 2003
[04:00] <Xaice> is the option 'ro' equivalent to 'mode=0444' in /etc/fstab?

[04:00] <Trentster> can any1 get the nvidia beta drivers working without losing dual core cpu compatability and frequency scaling?
[04:01] <variant> Xaice: it means the disk will be mounted read only, so it wont matter what permissions you set on the mount point, writing will still be impossible
[04:01] <compudaze> Trentster, the drives should mess with the smp of the kernel

[04:02] <compudaze> yes, sorry =)
[04:02] <netpython> peter_: example:qemu-img create Gast-OS.img 4500M and then qemu -boot -d -hda pathto Gast-OS.img -drom /dev/cdrom

[04:23] <Trist_an> to1, try in system settings to go to monitor and display and to choose the fglrx driver. It will modify your conf and it should work after
[04:23] <axisys> how do i get autoconnect to a dhcp network? everytime i take my laptop to different network i have to restart the laptop to get an IP
[04:23] <sid3wind3r> k. i tryed to install something and this came up
[04:24] <sid3wind3r>  Depends: tango-icon-theme-common  but it is not installable
[04:24] <sid3wind3r>  Depends: python-vte  but it is not installable
[04:24] <sid3wind3r>  Depends: python-gnome2-extras  but it is not installable
[04:24] <axisys> there used to be a icon on the top w/ autoconnect to a dhcp network
[04:24] <axisys> w/ dapper
[04:24] <Trist_an> axisys, you can do sudo ifdown ethX and then sudo ifup ethX with X the number of your active connection
[04:24] <Skid> hi guys, just installed unbutu-server on a poweredge 860 (SATA)... googling around for the problem of /dev/sda1 does not exist, dropping to a shell doesn't return any solutions, i'm using 6.06 lts, like and wondering if anyone would know of a fix?
[04:25] <to1> Trist_an : I tryed to use the fglrx drivers, but after following differents tutos, my x server don't load when configured with fglrx
[04:25] <Skid> (latest kernel, I'm trying to get on there too - stable)
[04:25] <hangfire> sid3wind3r- you probably dont have multiuniverse open yet
[04:25] <axisys> Trist_an: there used to be a cool app that would autoconnect u.
[04:25] <axisys> was it network manager or something
[04:25] <sid3wind3r> k, how do i open it?
[04:26] <hangfire> sid3wind3r- I actually dont know, it just opened automatically when I installed sun java5
[04:26] <Skid> it's an internal drive too..
[04:27] <sid3wind3r> -.- i shoulda just stuck with windows. All i wanted linux for was to downlaod music coz there not that many viruses for it.

[04:28] <atc> hey, I just installed edgy, but I have some folder permission problems... Every time I start up I mount a fat32 file system to a folder, but when I log in with my user, it's read-only... said in another way, root has automatically gotten the write permissions.. can't change them.. that's my problem
[04:28] <sid3wind3r> lol if you say so.
[04:29] <Lincoln-6-Echo> hey
[04:29] <mgedmin> lupine_85: nope, that silly slider wanted the new size of the NTFS partition, not the size of the new linux partition

=== Lincoln-6-Echo is now known as norharpe
[04:29] <suckamc> so. when I boot into linux from grub my ubuntu login screen is kinda greyish and not all there. after about a minute I get "BusyBox v1.1.3 (Debian 1:1.1.32ubuntu3) Built-in shell (ash)" "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" How can I get ubuntu to boot gnome properly?
[04:30] <hangfire> atc- sudo chmod (where are the gurus? I have to answer this stuff with my feable knowledge)
=== lc_ is now known as Synaptic
[04:30] <norharpe> Where can I find an installation guide for Ubuntu 6.10?
[04:30] <suckamc> then I'm put a a prompt (intramfs)
[04:30] <norharpe> Desktop Version
[04:31] <CarinArr> norharpe, er.. you put the cd in, click install, follow onscreen prompts
[04:31] <atc> hangfire: have tried it.. doesn't work..
[04:31] <norharpe> eh... I get a black screen when I do that. Don't I wait long enough?
[04:32] <atc> when I'm logged in as root, it's unable to change the owner of the folder..
[04:32] <hangfire> atc- it has to work. Is it in your home folder? maybe there are some folder permision problems
[04:33] <ailean> is there a tag i can use to make an app open on a particular desktop or minimised (or both)?
[04:33] <atrus> atc: fat32 doesn't have permissions on files. you just have to decide what permissions it has at mount time.
[04:33] <atc> atrus: hmm.. didn't quite get that?
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[04:34] <atrus> atc: do you want the fat32 partition to be readable and writable by everyone?
[04:34] <dcraven> ailean, devilspie can do that.
[04:34] <atc> yes please
[04:34] <doccy> why cant i use the setfont function on ubuntu?
[04:35] <ailean> dcraven, i want to type a command into the sessions app to start KTorrent each time I log in, but I don't want it in my face.  Will it do that?
[04:35] <atc> it worked on dapper
[04:35] <norharpe> I guess it is something that does not fit with my computer and the CD.
[04:35] <dcraven> ailean, I don't know what the sessions app or KTorrent is. So I'm not sure. Check out the devilspie website.
[04:36] <ailean> dcraven, k, thanks
[04:36] <atrus> atc: you can use the options "umask=000,uid=0,gid=0". that makes the mounted partition owned by root, with the root group, but rwx for everyone. you can change that umask and the uid and gid if you want to restrict it to a particular user or group later, as required, depending on how secure you need that partition to be.
[04:36] <peter_> Anyone know how to make a hdfile in qemu?
[04:37] <suckamc> anyone tell me how I can fix "/bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off" besides reformatting?
[04:37] <atc> I mount it in fstab with this.. /dev/hda5 /home/atc/fat32 vfat defaults 1 2
[04:37] <roler> Where do I change what file extensions get opened by what program??
[04:38] <norharpe> I'm leaving... Linux is too advanced anyway...
[04:38] <atc> is something wrong with that
[04:38] <atrus> atc: so you need to change that "default" to what i said. read the mount man page for more details if you like.
[04:38] <Skid> so is there problems with ubuntu and 2.6.18.2 + SATA?
[04:38] <atc> ok great Ill try that
[04:38] <atc> thanks

[04:38] <mrcuteo> anyone knows how to compile psybnc in ubuntu and what gcc/lib file i needed?
[04:38] <atc> ok
[04:39] <ailean> dcraven, looks like it's what I'm looking for
[04:39] <Skid> mrcuteo: apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev
[04:39] <Skid> then you'll be able to compile it

[04:59] <dom_f> squidly:  (My personal opinion only) - If you've installed 6.10 then a number of people have struggled - it might be worth trying 6.06 (Dapper) even if you just boot off the live cd and see if you have the same problem.

[05:04] <VSpike> hmm ok there seems to be no real logic to this, but I've found the combination by trial and error
[05:04] <Trentster> compudaze, yes I installed with the aptitude command you gave me, it installed the nvidia -glx beta drivers but the restricted modules was allready on the system so it did not do an install for them when i ran your aptitude command.
[05:04] <u4ia> thanks compudaze - that helped
[05:04] <compudaze> Trentster, u need to upgrade the linux-restricted-modules package as well

[05:11] <defrysk> the conflict with nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx amranth can be solved with sudo aptitude nvidia-glx , it will downgrade certain packages to make the nvidia-beta installable

[05:14] <landexem_> How can I have a different background image per workspace in Edgy?
[05:14] <defrysk> for lack of a better place that is
[05:14] <compudaze> it shouldn't be included at all

[05:19] <ianm_> I'm looking for ruby bindings for gstreamer 0.10, is this not in ubuntu?  I only see libgstreamer0.8-ruby
[05:19] <Cocytus> ifireball: If thats possible :P i only have one eth .. i hope to be able to route between two differents subnets on the same physical interface
[05:19] <foomonkey> highneko: how much data? thumb drive sure is handy if small amount (< 2GB or so)
[05:19] <highneko> Spec[x] : 2gb would be nice. I don't wanan waste any dvds.
[05:19] <Skid> Cocytus: yeah just enable vlan support
[05:20] <gigi> a question
[05:20] <ifireball> Cocytus: yeah, its very possible, though now very useful security and bandwidth-wise
[05:20] <Spec[x] > highneko: well, a crossover cable is a special cat5 cable that crosses over, sometimes they're given to you with a dsl "modem" or cable "modem"
[05:20] <ifireball> Cocytus: not* very useful
[05:20] <gigi> where put my script on xchat ubuntu?
[05:20] <highneko> Spec[x] : My new computer came with something that looked like a phone cord. I think it said modem or something.
[05:20] <Spec[x] > well, that was probably a phone cord, and probably goes to a modem
[05:20] <Skid> if oyusend them down different vlans, security isn't an issue
[05:20] <Cocytus> Skid: Hmm, where? I need to do more "special" stuff other than adding eth0:1 ?
[05:20] <gigi> may be /.xchat2?
[05:21] <Skid> you'd need to recompile the kernel to suppor t802.11 vlan support
=== Spec[x]  is now known as Spec
[05:21] <Skid> but that's getting more advanced into it... though if you're routing on it, it can't hurt :)
[05:21] <eddieduce> I can not run the Ubuntu 6.10 iso image. I get an" open files" [with]  window?
[05:21] <Cocytus> ifireball: That'll be OK. My home pipe is 20mbit, the interface is 100mbit, the primary reason for doing this is ease of NAT'ing and traffic shaping
[05:21] <Skid> eddieduce: you need to burn it to a cd
[05:21] <gigi> anyone?
[05:22] <ifireball> Cocytus: k. good luck
[05:22] <Cocytus> ifireball: thanks :P
[05:22] <Skid> gigi: .xchat2/scripts i think
[05:22] <gigi> i'm download script for xchat on dapper
=== mumbles-off is now known as mumbles
[05:22] <Cocytus> Skid: Hmm :) ok.
[05:22] <eddieduce> Skid, that is where I am trying to run it from.
[05:22] <Skid> it'll say in the readme anyway
[05:22] <Skid> Cocytus: vlans are just "virtual" lans
[05:22] <gigi> thks skid
[05:22] <Skid> so you could say have a vlan for VOIP if you have it
[05:22] <Skid> and prioritise it
[05:22] <Skid> over http, say
[05:23] <Skid> or whatnot
[05:23] <ifireball> Cocytus: I don't think you have to recompile afaik normal kernel supports defining ethX:n interfaces
[05:23] <Skid> for just network aliass, no recompiling
[05:23] <Skid> just add the alias in /etc/network/interfaces
[05:23] <Cocytus> Skid: ah, right. I'm prioritizing on ports, mostly.
[05:23] <doccy> where is the smbpasswd file located?
[05:23] <Cocytus> ifireball: yah, they do.
[05:23] <compudaze> doccy, usually /var/lib/samba
[05:24] <compudaze> passdb.tdb
[05:24] <doccy> ohh i thought the file was actually called 'smbpasswd'
[05:25] <compudaze> thats the program used to change the passwds
[05:26] <chicaguai> hola
[05:26] <gigi> thks all

[05:50] <coz_> prestosd, well they be held back because they are being updated on the repositories
[05:51] <a_l_e> ... but you don't have to tell them that you're on ubuntu!
[05:51] <a_l_e> ... and your problem doesn't have to be ubuntu specific
[05:51] <prestosd> so, what can i do? just wait?
[05:51] <coz_> prestosd, try later or tomorrow, if the same thing occurs come back or... someone else here may have another answer for you

[05:52] <prestosd> should i? if so what should i look for?
[05:52] <coz_> preaction, system/aministration/synaptic package manager
[05:52] <prestosd> why did you say preaction?
[05:52] <Amishman> bummer.  I wanted to install and use Ubuntu.  I guess us PPC folks have less options.
[05:52] <n3wbi3> hi!
[05:52] <compudaze> what bootloader did you install?
[05:52] <compudaze> for your ppc?
[05:52] <coz_> prestosd, then hit the search button and type in one of the things you are trying to update
[05:53] <coz_> prestosd, if it is there click on it and mark it for installation
[05:53] <coz_> prestosd, hit the apply button
[05:53] <prestosd> doing those steps.......
[05:53] <n3wbi3> why does my computer hang/stop everytime I insert a USB flash disk? I'm using 6.06 LTS

[05:54] <Skid> erm, having a blank... how do I add a user/group access (read+write) to a directory again?
[05:54] <coz_> prestosd, is it working?
[05:54] <Skid> chown g+rw <dir>
[05:54] <prestosd> so far...its says that I have to remove gkrellm-common to upgrade gkrellm
[05:54] <watchme> hi all
[05:54] <prestosd> is that okay?
[05:55] <defrysk> prestosd, sure
[05:55] <prestosd> k
[05:55] <coz_> prestosd, yes i believe so, you may have anolder version and it needs to update that first
[05:55] <prestosd> okay
[05:55] <prestosd> im doing the other packages now.....
[05:55] <coz_> prestosd, you can always reinstall that if it doesn't work for you
[05:55] <watchme> I have a problem to install the right nvidia kernel driver... kan anyone help me?
[05:55] <prestosd> okay
[05:55] <coz_> watchme, what right driver do youwant?
[05:56] <psusi> Skid: chown changes the OWNer... chmod sets the permissions
[05:56] <coz_> watchme, are you edgy?
[05:56] <watchme> coz_: I have had the Original-Beta-driver, now i uninstalled it and installed nvidia-glx and restricted-modules again
[05:56] <watchme> coz_: yes
[05:56] <Skid> oops, meant to write that :)
[05:56] <coz_> watchme, you don't nvidia-glx with the beta driver
[05:56] <watchme> coz_: and now I get the log, that he cannot find the right kernel-module
[05:57] <prestosd> it says cannot upgrade kompile because depends: kdesu (not installable)
[05:57] <Skid> i'm after changina  directory in /usr/local to give user permissiont o read and write to it?
[05:57] <watchme> coz_: I uninstalled the original one
[05:57] <ZeZu> n3wbi3, ubuntu auto-mounts, you can disable that, perhaps there is something wrong w/ the usb disk or else perhaps a bug
[05:57] <coz_> watchme, right ok you also have beryl installed?
[05:57] <watchme> yes
[05:57] <coz_> watchme, ok hold on
[05:57] <watchme> but now my X doesnt start
[05:57] <compudaze> what error?
[05:57] <defrysk> watchme, install it back with aptitude install nvidia-glx , it wil preform the needed downgrades to install the beta driver again
[05:57] <psusi> Skid: to give what user(s) permission?
[05:58] <ZeZu> you can try manually mounting the usb disk after you disable the auto mount, might help if you know the FS type of the partition on the disk
[05:58] <Skid> a user, permission to write and read to the dir
[05:58] <coz_> watchme, go to this link and follow it carefully   ... forst read it and see if you did eveything correctly     http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[05:58] <psusi> Skid: I asked which user?
[05:58] <n3wbi3> ZeZu: how do i do that?
[05:58] <Skid> didnt think it'd matter.. :) but the username is 'el'
[05:58] <watchme> coz_: args... Im at console now... no C&P.. can you write is in a qry again?
[05:58] <prestosd> coz_ you there?
[05:58] <defrysk> watchme, and do do dist-upgrades for a few weeks
[05:58] <coz_> watchme, http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-5021-howto-beryl-aiglx-nvidia-drivers
[05:58] <ZeZu> not sure exactly where the option is,  i'm sure someone in here knows though
[05:59] <psusi> Skid: all users, or just one user?  is this one user the owner of the directory or in the owning group?
[05:59] <watchme> defrysk: I did that many times
[05:59] <prestosd> coz_: you still there?
[05:59] <gharz> guys... i just read from the ubuntu website that edgy eft is available and i can upgrade? is this true? i just want to upgrade and i don't want to download the whole installer.
[05:59] <ZeZu> anyone in here tell n3wbi3 how he can disable auto mounting on USB disks ?
[05:59] <Skid> psusi: just one user, who's username matches the group name, and the directory is owned at the moment by root
[05:59] <defrysk> watchme, if you use the beta drivers vrom the amaranth repo i wouldnt for it will remove the beta driver
[05:59] <prestosd> gharz: it takes a long time to upgrade
[05:59] <coz_> watchme, you need to remove nvidia-glx
[05:59] <psusi> Skid: do you want the directory owned by root or can you chown it to the user?
[05:59] <prestosd> and you can either download the cd and upgrade through that
[06:00] <watchme> coz_:  and then?
[06:00] <k0rd> how do I find out what the hd translates into grub
[06:00] <prestosd> or you can just run the installer and it will download the files for you
[06:00] <Skid> psusi: whichever, by not altering the owner, that'd be a bonus I suppose
[06:00] <prestosd> but it still takes a LONG time
[06:00] <watchme> coz_: I want to delete the Beta-driver and get back to nvidia-glx
[06:00] <ZeZu> k0rd, man grub
[06:00] <coz_> watchme, ok three commands for you   no promises    sudo rm /etc/init.d/nvidia-*
[06:00] <coz_> sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-glx nvidia-settings nvidia-kernel-common
[06:00] <coz_> sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[06:00] <gharz> prestosd, what do u mean? do u suggest that i download the installer and reinstall everything? i'm concerned about my personal files.
[06:00] <prestosd> infact, i messed mine up, and it took around 18 hours!
[06:00] <prestosd> NO
[06:01] <prestosd> i mean, there are options
[06:01] <psusi> Skid: well if the user is in the group that owns the directory, then chmod g+rw
[06:01] <prestosd> i suggest downloading the iso and upgrading from the cd
[06:01] <prestosd> but you MUST download the iso for upgrading
[06:01] <prestosd> not the livecd
[06:01] <peter_> How do I restore the include file in usr/src/linux-source !! I cant rename it!
[06:01] <gharz> so that's possible? just an upgrade... ok let me do that.
[06:01] <gharz> prestosd... thanks!!!!!
[06:01] <Skid> the user usn't in the root group, so I guess the next idea of altering the permission to it wold be best?
[06:01] <prestosd> sure!
[06:01] <coz_> gharz, yes an upgrade is possible BUT if you can a clean install is better
[06:02] <psusi> peterwhat?
[06:02] <Skid> what if i'm after giving them write access to /var/run too ?
[06:02] <prestosd> instructions are on ubuntu.com
[06:02] <prestosd> for upgrading
[06:02] <psusi> peter_: what?
[06:02] <itodd> anyone have a solution to the greyscale/messed up boot screen for amd-64 users on eft?
[06:02] <filip_> i have som problems with installing flashplayer on firefox. someone that can help?
[06:02] <psusi> itodd: you mean the splash screen isn't supposed to be all grey? ;)
[06:03] <coz_> filip_, what is the problem
[06:03] <itodd> psusi: i hope not. it looks like doodoo. and i can't see the startup log
[06:03] <coz_> filip_, what did you try so far?
[06:03] <filip_> well, i follow the instructions on adobes homepage (linked from youtube)
[06:03] <filip_> But when im in the installer i cant do anything..
[06:04] <filip_> im supposed to press enter
[06:04] <psusi> if you want to see the log, look in /var/log... if you want to see it when it happens, remove the splash option from the kernel command line in /boot/grub/menu.lst... otherwise, it is supposed to be a nice visual indicator of the boot progress
[06:04] <coz_> filip_, well all you need to is put the liflashplyer.so < whatever it is called in the plugins fold of mozilla firefox
[06:04] <peter_> psusi,  I guess I have done something wrong when I linked new linux header files. Should be generic in the end but I used 386. Then I linked it wrong (Ithink) I have the old include file saved as include.orig  but I cant rename it back to just include
[06:04] <coz_> filip_, you may have to log in as root to do that unless sokeone here has a command for that
[06:04] <coz_> filip_,  and I am sure someone here has that command
[06:05] <psusi> peter_: why not?
[06:05] <coz_> be back
[06:05] <peter_> psusi, Bareword "include" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at (eval 1) line 1.
[06:06] <psusi> peter_: that does not look like a response to any mv command I can imagine
[06:06] <prestosd> wow, when coz_ left it really slowed down! :)
[06:07] <peter_> I just used the rename command =) First to rename the includefile to include.error and then the include.orig to just include. Is this wrong?
[06:07] <RevFrSanctus> ok, i have the fglrx drivers installed.  They work.  Xgl and Beryl work.  Direct rending works.  But, ctrl-alt-function key doesn't (it gives a garbled screen).  What can I do to fix it?
[06:07] <jbroome> is the issue with courier in edgy just for upgrades, or is it a problem in fresh installs also?
[06:07] <therapy> P
[06:07] <Yada> Hi on ubuntu Edgy server, anyone know why I have a login prompt on the console before the end of all the startup scripts ? Then how to change it (/etc/default/rcS did not change anything).
[06:08] <watchme> Yada: how about a sleep() function ?
[06:08] <peter_> psusi, I just used the rename command =) First to rename the includefile to include.error and then the include.orig to just include. Is this wrong?
[06:08] <psusi> peter_: yes.... there is no rename command afaik... you move or rename files in unix with the mv command
[06:08] <peter_> psusi, AHA! =)
[06:08] <gharz> why am i getting this => http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2: MD5Sum mismatch ?
[06:08] <Yada> watchme: where ?
[06:08] <watchme> sometimes it takes a little longer to start all scripts
[06:08] <gharz> what does it mean?
[06:08] <defrysk> rename is mv indeed
[06:09] <ailean> anyone here use gmail on firefox?
[06:09] <psusi> gharz: what were you doing that gave that result?
[06:09] <defrysk> ailean, as webmail ?
[06:09] <ailean> yeah
[06:09] <gharz> gksu "update-manager -c" and i pressed "check"...
[06:09] <Yada> watchme: yep but it should launch then in order and I guess launch sulogin only at the end, no ?
[06:09] <defrysk> sometimes I use firefox yes
[06:09] <gharz> psusi, gksu "update-manager -c" and i pressed "check"...
[06:10] <ailean> defrysk, when i type in the start of a name, the rest doesn't appear, as it does in windows, and it means a lot of extra work finding contacts' email addresses
[06:10] <watchme> Yada: it _does_ launch in order, but scripts are faster than others ;)
[06:10] <prestosd> gharz: then what?
[06:10] <defrysk> ailean, on edgy ?
[06:10] <psusi> gharz: I'm not familliar with update-manager... try a sudo apt-get update
[06:10] <gharz> prestosd, then i got that error message.
[06:10] <gharz> ok.
[06:10] <gharz> thanks.
[06:10] <prestosd> what error?
[06:10] <ailean> defrysk, yes
[06:11] <drkfiber> Hi, I upgraded to Edgy and firefox is still at 1.5 I have tried re-installing through synaptic and it is still running 1.5. Any Ideas?
[06:11] <filip_> almost every time i try to do an "sudo apt-get ***********"  i get the message that it can not find the package
[06:11] <gharz> psusi, i tried apt-get update and i got the same message => Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2  MD5Sum mismatch
[06:11] <defrysk> ailean, let me check in the settings....
[06:11] <prestosd> have you run apt-get update a few times?
[06:11] <RevFrSanctus> ok, i have the fglrx drivers installed.  They work.  Xgl and Beryl work.  Direct rending works.  But, ctrl-alt-function key doesn't (it gives a garbled screen).  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?
[06:11] <ailean> defrysk, ta
[06:12] <watchme> RevFrSanctus: I did it with "Automatix2" ;)
[06:12] <peter_> psusi, So now it should work? Do I have to ln something? Its a diffrent color on the includefile now. Before pink now blue
[06:12] <watchme> oh... sry.. I read wrong.. :D
[06:12] <watchme> RevFrSanctus: I meant Ctrl-Alt-Del
[06:12] <Yada> watchme: I see your point but neither see this before on dapper, breezy or all the unixes I worked on... Look like due to upstart.../...
[06:12] <psusi> peter_: now what should work?
[06:12] <prestosd> gharz: run the commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo dselect update a few times until there arent any errors
[06:13] <gharz> prestosd, ok... thanks. i'll do that.
[06:13] <prestosd> k, tell me when your done.....
[06:13] <peter_> I failed to compile some programs because the headerfiles were wrong (or wrong linked, dont know) like vmware.

[06:14] <ailean> defrysk, i think i got it, thanks
[06:14] <defrysk> ailean, in he=istorysection the second box should be ticked

[06:15] <drkfiber>  Hi, I upgraded to Edgy and firefox is still at 1.5 I have tried re-installing through synaptic and it is still running 1.5. Any Ideas?
[06:15] <gharz> prestosd, i'm getting that same message... Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2  MD5Sum mismatch

[06:15] <watchme> bye
[06:16] <prestosd> hmm, go to system>administration>software sources
[06:16] <gharz> prestosd, i forgot the location as to where i can edit the list of repositories
[06:16] <defrysk>  /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:16] <prestosd> oh, okay its, yah what he said
[06:16] <prestosd> :)
[06:16] <gharz> ok.
[06:16] <gharz> thanks.
[06:16] <prestosd> sure
[06:16] <ailean> I have Ubuntu installed on HDD1 and Windows installed on HDD2, both on same channel, Ubuntu master, Windows slave. I can't get GRUB to boot Windows. any ideas?
[06:16] <drkfiber> jrib: /opt/firefox/firefox
[06:17] <Yada> watchme: check it out on Edgy and you see ;-) Pretty annoying think for some usages...
[06:17] <prestosd> ailean: do you have any errors? if so, what are they?
[06:17] <jrib> drkfiber: close all instances of firefox and run /usr/lib/firefox/firefox, that is the repository version.  You have installed your own into /opt
[06:17] <ailean> prestosd, i have a single line of garbage
[06:17] <prestosd> which is?
[06:18] <drkfiber> hmm, I don't remember installing firefox, I will try.
[06:18] <ailean> prestosd, symbols. starting with a small delta, but i forget the rest
[06:18] <prestosd> thats wierd
[06:18] <jrib> drkfiber: did you use some kind of "helper script"?
[06:18] <ailean> prestosd, but, it loads on its own, when i unplug the ubuntu hdd
[06:18] <prestosd> um, which did you install first? windows or ubuntu?
[06:19] <defrysk> ailean, put your menu.lst op pastebin
[06:19] <drkfiber> ah, possibly. When I run it from /usr/lib/firefox it is version 2.
[06:19] <ailean> k
[06:19] <jrib> drkfiber: do you understand what you have to do now?
[06:20] <drkfiber> yeah, I think so, Just edit the menu item to point to the correct version.
[06:20] <jrib> drkfiber: well ideally you would make /usr/bin/firefox point to the right place.  And remove and dpkg diversions that may exist
[06:21] <ailean> defrysk, prestosd, http://pastebin.com/819079
[06:21] <drkfiber> O.K. Thanks, I will look into how to do that.
[06:21] <prestosd> ailean: whats that for??
[06:21] <ailean> prestosd, drkfiber asked
[06:21] <jrib> drkfiber: the removal section at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion may be helpful.  Also dpkg-divert --list '*firefox*' may help.  Just ask if you are unsure
[06:22] <prestosd> oh, k
[06:22] <RevFrSanctus> watchme, I don't need ctlr-alt-del to work.  What doesn't work is getting to a console by means of ctrl-alt-function.  Everything else with the video works, but when I try to go to console, it doesn't.  Brightness keys don't work either (fn-up and down)

[06:32] <bllx> could anyone tell me how to turn on journaling on my ext3 root partition?
[06:32] <cypher1> why is the kernel not stopping to read the dvd's bad sectors even after i close the dvd player application ??
[06:32] <defrysk> bllx, ext3 is journaloing
[06:33] <Tim90> Any one have a Kmobiletools installed
[06:33] <defrysk> bllx, otherwise it would be ext2
[06:33] <cypher1> this practically makes the system draggg

[06:33] <Akuma_> i just installed ubuntu and have two mounted partition icons on my derktop. i thought they were just shortcuts, but they behave in a funny way ... is it safe for me to delete them?
[06:34] <Whatsisname> does anyone know how to completely flush the nat table and reset all forwarded connections in iptables?
[06:34] <cypher1> Joe_SWAU, realplayer ?
[06:34] <Whatsisname> it seems that even after -F and -X some connections remain in there as being established
[06:34] <Whatsisname> which shouldn't be in there, the connections are in fact terminated
[06:34] <Joe_SWAU> cypher1: No, it is Windows Media a .wmv file.
[06:34] <bllx> just I mounted my ext3 partition in os X, and it was listed as journal enabled, but journaling off
[06:34] <sparrwork> I installed kubuntu and 3d acceleration on my i865 onboard 'just worked', detected as i810.  I did an update in Adept, possibly getting new/bad drivers.  I installed a few seemingly unrelated packages.  Now I have rebooted and have no 3D acceleration (slow gl screensavers, glxgears.  direct rendering: no in glxinfo).  What might I have broken, how can I check, and how can I fix it?
[06:34] <bllx> maybe that's a quirk of os X

[06:47] <TheGateKeeper> livingdaylight: I will have to put it on my web site, was in my notes, hence I could not find it
[06:47] <Lattyware> And what connection speed do you have, because unless you have a really fast connection, running multiple torrents will slow you to a crawl.
[06:47] <gigi> che puo essere?
[06:47] <j2daosh> yoman, how are you trying to mount it? what is it exactly (harddrive? what format, fat 16/32/ntfs)?
[06:47] <gigi> just a problem..........
[06:47] <j2daosh> what is your mount point
[06:47] <walnut> I use bittorrent client downloaded in Ubuntu by default.
[06:47] <yoman> pmount
[06:47] <livingdaylight> TheGateKeeper, aha...show me your website anyhow, please?
[06:47] <yoman> pmount hda5
[06:47] <j2daosh> why pmount?

[06:48] <j2daosh> u are trying to permenantly mount it
[06:49] <yoman> and?
[06:49] <j2daosh> and its not mounting right :P
[06:49] <j2daosh> i need to know a few things from you
[06:49] <yoman> how can i mount it?
[06:49] <Lattyware> Walnut: Try another client.
[06:49] <yoman> ask
[06:49] <TheGateKeeper> livingdaylight: good luck, back in a bit...
[06:49] <doccy> all of a sudden it seems my kismet has no UI - just black background without the usual neon green outlines. any idea what's going on here?
[06:49] <walnut> I upgrade my Ubutu 6.06 to 6.10 and before this I don't have this kind of problem.
[06:49] <livingdaylight> TheGateKeeper, ok
[06:49] <Lattyware> BitTornado or Azureus are good choices. uTorrent under wine too.
[06:49] <livingdaylight> TheGateKeeper, by the way -c is for continue
[06:49] <j2daosh> one - what is the devicename, two, where is the mount point, three what is the filesystem type
[06:50] <Lattyware> You'll do better with a better client anyway
[06:50] <RunicMourning> j2daosh: i think he said fat32
[06:50] <walnut> I try also to remove any service on my router firewall!!
[06:50] <TheGateKeeper> livingdaylight: ok thanx :-)
[06:50] <ailean> defrysk, got it working, but with a couple of changes from your script
[06:50] <yoman> i don't know how
[06:50] <j2daosh> did you see my box?
[06:50] <walnut> Do you think is better to use another client?

[06:51] <yoman> no
[06:51] <j2daosh> ok
[06:51] <Lattyware> walnut: Yeah, using another Client rather than the default one is allways best.
[06:51] <j2daosh> type this
[06:52] <Lattyware> You will get better speeds, and more peers with things like DHT.
[06:52] <walnut> Ok I will try. Thanks. Bye
[06:52] <j2daosh> actually... what is the device name? hdb1?
[06:52] <j2daosh> and your mount point folder is where?
[06:52] <j2daosh> /media?/mnt?
[06:53] <yoman> "/dev/hda5"
[06:53] <j2daosh> sudo mount -t fat32 /dev/drive /mount/point
[06:54] <j2daosh> ok so you would type sudo mount -t fat32 /dev/hda5 /whereever/mountpoint
[06:54] <j2daosh> then if you get no errors doing that, type df -k
[06:54] <Smotang> hey, I have a dual boot of winxp and linux, I can see the winxp filestystem while in linux but cannot edit it. I cannot see the linux filesystem on windows full stop (cus windows is a tyrannical bastard)

[06:54] <Smotang> is there any way to edit the winxp filestystem?
[06:54] <Smotang> ie add files
[06:54] <j2daosh> yeah... change mount/point to whereever you want it mounted
[06:54] <njal> I have just got a new monitor and need to increase the screen res, is it simply a matter of sudo dpkg --reconfigure xserver-xorg?
=== YouDontKnowMe is now known as kmaynard
[06:54] <yoman> k
[06:54] <ailean> Smotang, load Windows is the easiest way. i presume u can't do that?
[06:55] <j2daosh> Smotang: yeah, but you need to download experimental packages that could corrupt ntfs
[06:55] <Smotang> I can do that, but then i cant access the files i want to transfer
[06:55] <Smotang> what i want to do in a nutshell is transfer files from linux to winxp
[06:55] <ailean> Smotang, i think it's called fuse, but writing to ntfs systems if very dangerous
[06:55] <Smotang> on same computer
[06:55] <j2daosh> Smotang: 2 options
[06:55] <ailean> *is
[06:55] <yoman> mount: unknown filesystem type 'fat32'
[06:55] <j2daosh> 1, make a small fat32 partitions and mount it in linux
[06:56] <ailean> Smotang, you are better downloading a program FOR WINDOWS that can read the ext3 system
[06:56] <j2daosh> yoman, try vfat
[06:56] <yoman> k
[06:56] <Smotang> yer, but I didnt do that so i have a swap and the linux partition and the ntfs so no space for the fat32
[06:56] <j2daosh> Smotang: or u get a program called ext32if
[06:56] <Smotang> there are such programs?
[06:56] <ailean> Smotang, yep
[06:56] <j2daosh> ext32if will show ext3 filesystems in linux
[06:57] <ailean> Smotang, look at http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm for one example
[06:57] <Smotang> j2daosh is that for winx?
[06:57] <Smotang> *winxp?
[06:57] <j2daosh> yep
[06:57] <ailean> j2daosh, in winxp even?
[06:57] <j2daosh> i have it at my house
[06:57] <Smotang> thanks
[06:57] <j2daosh> u cant tranfer though
[06:57] <Hoxzer> Monamooor
[06:57] <j2daosh> only access
[06:57] <Smotang> thats what i want
[06:57] <Smotang> well it works ^^
[06:57] <j2daosh> writting between the filesystems is still sketchy
[06:57] <ailean> j2daosh, i had one, i'm just trying to remember WHICH
[06:57] <Smotang> why is it like that? different ways of writing?
[06:57] <ailean> j2daosh, but it was perfect
[06:58] <ailean> Smotang, yes, and MS won't tell anyone else how to write to an NTFS system
[06:58] <Smotang> ah figures
[06:58] <AcidTonic> I'm having an interesting problem, after upgrading to edgy, the network manager doesnt work like it used to
[06:58] <j2daosh> different fiesystem types... linux would write to windows,m but M$ complains
[06:58] <ailean> Smotang, the other idea is to write to a DVD
[06:58] <ailean> Smotang, then load it in Windows
[06:58] <yoman> it worked 10x
[06:58] <j2daosh> 10x?
[06:59] <AcidTonic> I have the network applet, which when i open it has the configure button.... before that brought up the location manager. Now hitting configure gives me one interface with the option to enable or disable and no other function
[06:59] <ailean> 10x = thanks
[06:59] <j2daosh> ahh
[06:59] <AcidTonic> I had to get online manually using dhclient3
[06:59] <RunicMourning> i guess i'll need to ask... anyone have experience with wireless on dell imspiron b130s (broadcom chipsets)

[07:01] <Legendre> how do you lock the screen, j2daosh ?
[07:01] <LjL> peter_, if i could predict the future i'd be rich :P but i don't think so, not in the short/mid term at least. VMware on the other hand (which is a commercial program, with a gratis version) is implementing Direct3D support
[07:01] <j2daosh> not sure with gnome... i use kde
[07:01] <j2daosh> should be an option under your logout

[07:12] <Coffeegrinds> kord: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
[07:13] <k0rd> k
[07:13] <coz_> scythe, I am not sure that is entirely true , owever one reason maybe that dma is not available on older drives
[07:13] <scythe> well, that makes sense coz
[07:13] <coz_> scythe, this way those of us , like you and I, have the oiption to enbale it or not
[07:13] <scythe> I just hate updateing hdparm.conf after every upgrade (dont get my on direct upgrade paths that actually work)
[07:14] <coz_> scythe, well enabling dma should e a ond shot deal I believe
[07:14] <scythe> It would be nice to have it as an option during install though
[07:14] <morphycs> bimberi: what about ipv6?

[07:15] <DeeTahPanLtah> Siniestro: u sure ur actually using glx? ;p
[07:15] <coz_> scythe, perhaps but it would be nice to have beryl as an option during install also, but... again, we just have to relyon the dvelpment team for thoses things
[07:15] <DeeTahPanLtah> i mean
[07:15] <DeeTahPanLtah> correct drivers?

[07:17] <scythe> im diving thru the man right now

[07:18] <coz_> scythe, try  sudo hdparm /dev/hdc
[07:18] <scythe> thnx
[07:18] <clode> I am fairly new to Ubuntu, and I just managed to install XMMS (music player) and the sound quality is horrible. Anything spesific causing this?
[07:19] <coz_> scythe, if you want to enable it I also have that
[07:19] <scythe> sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
[07:19] <scythe> I know how to enable, just not check status :)
[07:19] <coz_> scythe, you got it if you cd srive is at hdc
[07:20] <gpled> think ssh has it locked
[07:20] <scythe> yeah, but hdparm only enables for current up, when you reboot, you have to do it again
[07:20] <coz_> scythe,  do you have the settings to be sure it reamins on during reboot and all?
[07:20] <scythe> I usually just update my /etc/hdparm.conf
[07:20] <k0rd> is bit comet for *nix?
[07:20] <coz_> scythe, ok to what?
[07:20] <scythe> I just remembered it because I just installed dvdcess
[07:20] <scythe> brb, gotta go cut and paste

[07:24] <sparrwork> So I added the 'dri' module to my xorg.conf and my 3d acceleration "works" again.  But now I have boxes and Xs around particles (and maybe sprites) where I didn't a few reboots ago before this problem occurred.  Short of reinstalling to get the working configuration back and documenting every step I take, what can I do to try to troubleshoot this behavior?

[07:42] <rellis> I'm running Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper. Anyone know if there's a common bug with libsmbclient not working from within Konqueror/Nautilus attaching to some shares? Maybe only in a domain Environment?
[07:42] <roldyx> Kronusdark: i dont remember..
[07:42] <anders9034> i have tried to load the joydev and analogue modules (via this bash script: http://pastebin.ca/242779) but when trying to cat /dev/input/js0 i get "No such device". any clues? the gameport is onboard and enabled in bios. also there's no jumper settings needed for it to work.
[07:42] <rellis> I can even connect to the windows server within Konqueror, it displays all the shares. As soon as I try to select a share and display the contents it errors.
[07:43] <alecjw> gigi: what us the problem with sources.list? (btw, if you want support in italian, there's #ubuntu-it)

[07:43] <Adam_G> Hi all. I have a bunch of dependency issues from the edgy upgrade , which means apt tries to install a bunch of packages every time I install anything. Is there a quick/easy way to resolve dependencies?
[07:44] <roldyx> Kronusdark: but i need reinstall the system
[07:44] <nothlit> Does anyone know which compression FUSE based filesystem is the best
[07:44] <WikinG> why user manager don't make directory in home directory, when i make new user?
[07:44] <alecjw> Adam_G: do you have any 3rdf party repos (eg. beryl)? if so, make sure they're dgy
[07:44] <gpled> Kronusdark: woops.  seems like when ever i go to irc, everyone starts calling for help.
[07:44] <nastas> hi all!
[07:45] <Kronusdark> roldyx: what i would recomend is searching the web for error messages that you might have in your dmesg output also check the device manager and see if you can even see the drive
[07:45] <gpled> Kronusdark: i like to eject the usb drives when i am done.  helps make sure you close all your files that are being written to
[07:45] <roldyx> Kronusdark: if i put ubuntu brezy i havent problem for install but if i try install ubuntu dapper i can see the hd
[07:45] <Adam_G> alecjw, yes, but the problems are with things like nautilus, python-gnome, etc
[07:46] <nothlit> WikinG, did you try logging in to the user?
[07:46] <Guest598> selam
[07:46] <Kronusdark> roldyx: it may simply be a module you have to manually probe it worked fine on my NF3 board so thats as far as my knowledge goes on that
[07:46] <Adam_G> and I ran the "replace dapper with edgy" shell script on my sources.list to upgrade
[07:46] <Markive> anyone have a dell d600 here?
[07:46] <Kronusdark> gpled: then do you just push the power button or unplug it?
[07:46] <gigi> how to upgrade my dapper to edgy?
[07:47] <gpled> Kronusdark: yep
[07:47] <roldyx> Kronusdark: mmm maybe i need install a module..
[07:47] <Kronusdark> gpled: which one
[07:47] <gpled> Kronusdark: after i eject it
[07:47] <Markive> anyone got a radeon 9000 mobile card in there laptop?
[07:47] <gpled> Kronusdark: the power button on my drive
[07:47] <AsheD> so, I am running Xgl, and my comuter goes into screensaver mode whenever I play games for more than a few minutes
[07:47] <WikinG> nothlit, of course, but it don't log in, but make errors (no permissions, ... )
[07:47] <Kronusdark> gigi: gksu "update-manager -d" but unless your system is pristine i wouldnt recomend it
[07:48] <gpled> Kronusdark: to turn it on, i just plug the usb cable in, and power it on

[07:50] <gpled> Markive: is it from restrictive?
[07:50] <frolle> Is it sure that Samba is working on Edgy?

[07:51] <nastas> i have a pcmci tv card. does anyone knows something about how to make it work in ubuntu?
[07:51] <Markive> gpled i'm not sure, i saw it in there the other day and wondered if it would help my graphics frames per second etc on games i have a radeon 9000 mobile
[07:52] <gpled> Markive: i had trouble with nvida restrictive failing in the upgrade.  i just remove that repository and it started working
[07:53] <Markive> gpled , it kinda works, like it plays some of the games, but if there is a better driver so my card doesnt keep lagging
[07:53] <gpled> Markive: it, being my computer.  not the nvidia
[07:53] <wiz> nothlit, the top has an option to renice?
[07:53] <Markive> its jolty , like the opengl is crap
[07:53] <nothlit> wiz, r for renice
[07:53] <nothlit> wiz, i would recommend installing htop, its a great tool
[07:53] <wiz> nothlit, I wasn't aware of that, thanks :)

[07:58] <Scorpmoon> btw. how come Ubuntu server is a console application? Is it not common to have GUI's in servers nowadays?
[07:58] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, why don't you set up aliases in .bashrc for your unarchiving needs then

[07:59] <sgorilla80> well i know how to smbmount
[07:59] <frolle> yeah, but i cant connect to the computer
[07:59] <sgorilla80> i was wondering if there was a userfriendly way
[07:59] <sgorilla80> like my network
[07:59] <sgorilla80> im a human
[08:00] <Lachkater> hmm i had no proplem also hava some windows pcs^^

[08:00] <frolle> Im on a win computer now, i would like to see my shares on my ubuntu - but it doesnt work :|
[08:00] <ailean> Scorpmoon, i use it because it will become more userfriendly if i do
[08:00] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, most servers are only installed and tucked into a closet. it sits there without a monitor and if it needs any configuration a simple "ssh myserver" will do it
[08:00] <[A] ndy80> oh shit!
[08:00] <fredo> comment on fait pour ecrire en rouge ...a quelqu'un ?
[08:00] <nothlit> Markive, :)
[08:00] <sgorilla80> frolle: oh, you too?

[08:00] <[A] ndy80> O_o
[08:00] <[A] ndy80> what the f*** happened?
[08:00] <sgorilla80> frolle: i know how to do it, i want to know the human way, and not the robot way to do it
[08:00] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, crap! sure my server is in a closet, but that doesn't mean I don't need to configure it.. and configuration in a console is NOT useability
[08:00] <sgorilla80> i know the robot way
[08:00] <ailean> !fr
[08:00] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:01] <Scorpmoon> I would be so much more productive in a GUI environment
[08:01] <Scorpmoon> but does that slow down the server, is that way?
[08:01] <Scorpmoon> why
[08:01] <sgorilla80> hmm i guess i will do it the robot way
[08:01] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, not crap at all. it is userfriendly. but stop comparing it with windows. this is a different system. think different.
[08:01] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, I don't ever unarchive things from the command line but i have 15+ aliases, it seems that if you want to use console a lot, especially if you have to run the same command a lot, it would make sense to make an alias
[08:01] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, what's wrong with windows.. windows didn't invent GUI's .. Mac or Amiga OS did
[08:01] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, some servers you can configure from a webinterface if you need
[08:02] <nothlit> no Xerox
[08:02] <Scorpmoon> I want a userfriendly server, without paying bucks for Windows 2003 Server
[08:02] <Scorpmoon> so what do I choose?
[08:02] <sgorilla80> hmm i can't find smbmount in ubuntu ....
[08:02] <Scorpmoon> Ubuntu Server is in no way more userfriendly than any other linux
[08:02] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, anyways, just in case its nano -w ~/.bashrc         then just type alias aliasname='command'
[08:02] <sgorilla80> is there some other program that is newer that does that?
[08:02] <sgorilla80> i use ubuntu-server
[08:03] <sgorilla80> because i use them as development machines
[08:03] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, that's way too cumbersome.. all I'm saying is, why does tar have to be this difficult to use.. why do I need to google everytime I need to untar something
[08:03] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, nothing is wrong with windows. but linux is not windows and vice versa. a huge part of linux is "console". that's it. fact.
[08:03] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, you can install a server with a gui if you really want to
[08:03] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, I want an open source server with a GUI, what do I choose?
[08:03] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, and theres tons of FREE server control panels, just google for them
[08:04] <Scorpmoon> i don't want panels, or depend on google.. I want something that has GUI from the CD
[08:04] <sgorilla80> is /mnt deprecated?
[08:04] <Justy-> Hello

[08:06] <sgorilla80> how can you see what windows computers are on your network?
[08:06] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, BECAUSE ubuntu is not a server distribution.
[08:06] <sgorilla80> something like network  neighborhood
[08:06] <Scorpmoon> then don't release it as a server

[08:07] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, it is a full fledged server, just one that may not meet your particular needs.
[08:07] <Scorpmoon> well I installed it already

[08:07] <Jowi> sgorilla80, tksmb is similar
[08:07] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, installing what?
[08:07] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, didn't you choose the lamp option?
[08:07] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, yes, and the webpage said you'd be up and running in 15 minutes... can you alter that to days btw. ?
[08:08] <sgorilla80> Jowi: i just mounted it with smbfs
[08:08] <sgorilla80> i just wish gnome had some type of network neighborhood
[08:08] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, once thats done you just have to place a control panel in /var/www..... and run the install script.
[08:08] <Scorpmoon> a control panel`?
[08:08] <Jowi> sgorilla80, you can browse the network using tksmb. "sudo apt-get install tksmb"
[08:08] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, If your server is up already, you are up an running with a fully working lamp server.
[08:08] <nothlit> and*
[08:09] <sgorilla80> Jowi: ok i will check that out
[08:09] <Scorpmoon> i didn't use no control panel, what is that
[08:09] <Scorpmoon> my whole apache setup is very dirty and ugly
[08:09] <Scorpmoon> i have no control of it whatsoever
[08:09] <Scorpmoon> why can't it just be easy
[08:09] <nothlit> a control panel can be something that is php based, and it basically runs off apache and lets you control and manager your server from a gui browser on another computer.
[08:09] <Scorpmoon> i want to spend my precious time doing web development, not system administration
[08:10] <Scorpmoon> how come I wasnt told about this control panel during installation
[08:10] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, if you want to run development, you can just run a local server on your dev machine
[08:10] <Xaice> which ftp-server software would you suggest for a small home network
[08:10] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, because these things are addons
[08:10] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, MOST servers don't need any  of these tools
[08:10] <Scorpmoon> i just want a server OS that is a breeze to setup

[08:11] <BiSk-8> nothlit: and it blocks
[08:11] <Scorpmoon> i did a basic lamp installation
[08:11] <Scorpmoon> but it took me 15 days, not 15 minutes
[08:11] <nothlit> BiSk-8, download the standalone flash player from adobe
[08:12] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, what took 15 days
[08:12] <Scorpmoon> getting my webpage up and stuff

[08:16] <JohnM555> I just installed Ubuntu on my AMD64, I have a netgear 121 wireless usb device and I'm having problems getting it to work
[08:16] <JohnM555> I tried looking on ubuntu's site
[08:16] <sharperguy> when i try to install Ubuntu Edgy (i386 desktop) and go for "manualy partition", leave the partitions alone, and go to the screen where you can choose the names, andi set the desired partition to "/" (no quotes), and choose reformat, then press next, it complans that i have not selected a root partition. I have installed Edgy before and not come across this problem
[08:16] <Scorpmoon> lol was kicked from #centos... guess that's not an option
[08:16] <JohnM555> but I'm just getting confused
[08:16] <Scorpmoon> will you donate a windows 2003 server for me?

[08:18] <aldwin> can anyone help with my problem with linux ubuntu. here's how it go: i hav an amd x2 (dual core) 64bit 3.8ghz pc and i did download and tried both the desktop 6.10 for amd64 and the 6.10 alternate for amd64bit but both didn't work. i just endup with starting the cd and it did boot me up to the main menu of the disk. when i tried the install option. nothing happens... (just the splash screen of a black and white ubuntu logo, nothing more).
[08:18] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, go look for a distro on the distribution indexing sites, one of those will meet your needs, you don't seem to happy with ubuntu.
[08:18] <BiSk-8> nothlit, i installed it into the plugin folder, but how do i play the files?   im confused now...
[08:19] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, i really tried most distros already.. maybe it's linux i'm not too keen with :)
[08:19] <aldwin> does anyone here have the same problem?
[08:19] <Scorpmoon> Why did Amiga OS have to die? it was perfect
[08:19] <JohnM555> aldwin, there should be an option start ubuntu when you boot with the cd
[08:19] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, no, not a distro in that sense
[08:19] <JohnM555> I just installed ubuntu today with the 6.10 for amd64
[08:19] <erUSUL> aldwin: try booting with 'acpi=off'
[08:19] <erUSUL> !boot

[08:20] <nothlit> BiSk-8, no, i gave you a flash standalone player
[08:20] <nothlit> BiSk-8, just double click on it and then choose a file to run
[08:20] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, why can't you recommend me something
[08:20] <BiSk-8> nothlit, when i click on it it sais that its impossibile to open the file
[08:21] <Justy-> why no one answers my questions anymore =( i have been asking diffrent questions but nobody answers them for a week
[08:21] <^itch> Anyone willing to help me with a apache2 configuration?
[08:21] <sharperguy> the edgy installer is saying no root filesystem after selecting one using custom partitioning (and setting it to "/")
[08:22] <JohnM555> I have a question about this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoUseNdiswrapper
[08:22] <^itch> Each time I start or stop the apache2 server I`m geting this error (apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName), and I can`t figure it put how to fix it. Any sugestion ?
[08:23] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, because i can't remember any off the top of my head, and you are perfectly capable of googling
[08:23] <JohnM555> it says *make sure you've added Universe to your repositories
[08:23] <JohnM555> what is it talking about?
[08:23] <Quik[javascript] > are there french here ?
[08:23] <nothlit> BiSk-8, did you extract the file?
[08:23] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, google is not oppinionated
[08:23] <beagleisevil> is beagle still broke ?
[08:23] <nothlit> BiSk-8, you have to right click extract here
[08:23] <st4hl> hi, when i modify routing tables, they are not saved after system reboot, is there a reason for this?
[08:24] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, well I would have to google same as you since i can't remember,
[08:24] <sharperguy> he edgy installer is saying no root filesystem after selecting one using custom partitioning (and setting it to "/")
[08:24] <JohnM555> And...why does all this documentation about getting wireless to work involve downloading from the internet, when most people using wireless can't get on the internet from their computer

[08:24] <BiSk-8> nothlit, yeah i know
[08:24] <axisys> is there a chnl for evolution? i need find a way to cache headers instead of keep polling from the exchange server
[08:24] <BiSk-8> , nothlit, i try but it sais that i cant open it

[08:25] <st4hl> anyone?
[08:25] <JohnM555> Ugh...nobody's gonna help
[08:25] <nothlit> BiSk-8, right click it and go to properties then check the permissions tab and see if its executable
[08:25] <nothlit> BiSk-8, if not maybe your download was incomplete
[08:26] <BiSk-8> ah ok ty
[08:26] <BiSk-8> the permissions werent enough
[08:26] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, you'll learn to love it. replaced apache2 with lighttpd yesterday and thought it was gonna take me a couple of days to figure out. one hour later I was done. Memory usage went from 450MB (apache2) to 720K (lighttpd).

[08:27] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, that's the beauty of a linux system. you can customize it all you want. :)
[08:27] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, lighhttpd runs with php and everything? I'm running my server on a p2 300, and it's dead slow with apache
[08:27] <sharperguy> wow. what an amazing channel :(
[08:27] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, it has most of the modules apache does, but not all of them.
[08:27] <JohnM555> kunix, did do you have an amd64?
[08:27] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, nono.. I don't want to customize.. I want to develop web pages! I don't want to be a sys admin, I want to be creative!
[08:27] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, it is not a full fledged replacement
[08:27] <Scorpmoon> sys admins are not entirely sane

[08:28] <JohnM555> I really don't get how to use ndiswrapper to get my wireless to work :\
[08:28] <JohnM555> This is my first time using any type of linux, and I'm not totally sure what it wants me to do
[08:29] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, if you don't want full control of you server, rent a "webhotel" and store everything there for 5 bucks a month. cost is equal to having your own in energy costs alone.
[08:29] <nothlit> Jowi, whats the security of lighthttpd vs apache, ive been wondering for a while apache = monolothic but time tested
[08:29] <rambo3> one.com is cheap
[08:30] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, I thought about that... but first of all, I want my data to reside on my own computer, I don't trust webhosts :)
[08:30] <JohnM555> There are so many pages in the ubuntu help that don't exist
[08:30] <Jowi> nothlit, no idea. I've used it for a day. just tried it out for fun and the memory usage is amazing.
[08:30] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, I know that feeling :)
[08:31] <sharperguy> argh stupid ctrl+fffish
[08:31] <Scorpmoon> and webhosts always have a (*) star after their "unlimited traffic" promise
[08:31] <sharperguy> why is the Edgy installer saying no root filesystem when i definatly selected one to be "/" and formatted?!
[08:32] <miranda82> hello
[08:32] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, installation of things like webgallerys and all php applications would be the same from a windows server or from a linux server
[08:32] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, you can have two webservers on one computer you know. install it, read a manual, configure it. stop apache and start lighttpd. if you don't like it and if it doesn't work well with what you want it to do - stop lighttpd, uninstall it, start apache. no need to uninstall or delete any of your apache config files.
[08:32] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, you can always install gnome if you think it would make your task easier
[08:32] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, not the price
[08:32] <Scorpmoon> nothlit, i don't want to install gnome, I want it to be preinstalled
[08:33] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, you installed the server installation.
[08:33] <Scorpmoon> apt-get is way too tedious to use
[08:33] <Scorpmoon> synaptic GUI is getting abit better with 6.10
[08:33] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, use "aptitude" then
[08:33] <Scorpmoon> but I'm on ubuntu server :)
[08:33] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, the whole point of linux, is modularity and with ubuntu's based deb package management, the approach of ubuntu server is that a basic installation is there for you to add on top of easily
[08:34] <Daniel4711> Hey anyone know how to get SMB shares to stop hanging in Ubuntu?
[08:34] <Scorpmoon> i want a server that is just ready for me
[08:34] <Scorpmoon> i don't want to fiddle with it
[08:34] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, it sounds like your mission is different from ubuntus
[08:34] <Scorpmoon> I'm not a sys admin
[08:34] <Scorpmoon> but I'm a human being
[08:34] <dcraven> Wow this meta-tracker thing is very fast.
[08:34] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, yes but thats not a deficiency of the distro, just differing visions.
[08:34] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, again, ubuntu is a DESKTOP based distro.
[08:35] <axisys> what is goog chnl for evolution? (sorry for the repeat ques)
[08:35] <foo> how can I spit out the current resolution I'm in ?
[08:35] <Scorpmoon> then skip the ubuntu server stuff.. because people believe it's the same deal, but it's not :)
[08:35] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, the server installation is for the people who liked ubuntu from the desktop and want to run it as a server, and its by no means complete yet.
[08:35] <Scorpmoon> i'd say :)
[08:36] <nothlit> Scorpmoon, the server stuff is for more educated users. the descriptions and guides explain all of this if you read it

[08:37] <michael> yes
[08:38] <rccollins> Hello, I am new to IRC and Ubuntu honestly.  I have some questions about using XDMPC
[08:39] <dcraven> michael, well you could install them in /usr/local or something if you are afraid of overwriting the ones from the repo.
[08:39] <nothlit> rccollins, just ask them
[08:39] <michael> i've heard that is a big mistake.  Will it cause problems if I just install them to /usr?
[08:40] <dnite> nvidia finally released the 9 series driver for linux today, how can i install it without breaking apt? is it bad to just download it from nvidia.com and use their installation script?
[08:40] <dcraven> michael, hmm.. I've done it before, but I'm not sure how high it would rate on your *safety* scale :)
[08:40] <miranda82> is there a channel for enemy-territory?
[08:40] <boxgamex> anyone know what i can do when i try to install ubuntu via the thumbdrive insturctions on the wiki and it cant find /install/.vm when I try to install. i am going on 5.10
[08:40] <nothlit> oh they unbetad the driver?
[08:40] <Jowi> pierreSabatier, nous parlons anglais ici. va a #ubuntu-fr
[08:41] <michael> the problem is i'm trying to compile bmpx, but a lot of my libraries are outdated so I need to build them from source
[08:41] <Scorpmoon> Jowi, I just change my mind.. I'm moving to a webhost.. it's too cheap :)
[08:41] <dnite> nothlit, it appears so ... it's on nvidia.com as updated today ...
[08:41] <psusi> boxgamex: try going with 6.06 or 6..10
[08:42] <boxgamex> i dont hve the cd for that and im on dial up so downloading 700mb isnt favorable
[08:42] <nothlit> dnite, you will probably have to uninstall the local driver and disable it in linux restricted modules, then installing the nvidia version is fine, you just have to recompile it every time theres a kernel update (also make sure the build-essential package is installed)
=== elkbuntu_ is now known as elkbuntu
[08:42] <miranda82> while i play enemyterritory, my cursor goes always UP... any ideaS?
[08:42] <psusi> well using a version that is 2 releases out of date is going to probably give you headaches too ;)
[08:42] <Jowi> Scorpmoon, yep, it's not bad usually. you don't have full control but for some it's more convienient. I run my own server, my brother rent a space.
[08:43] <dnite> nothlit, ok.. sounds easy enough.. how do i disable it in linux restricted modules?
[08:43] <psusi> boxgamex: you do realize you can request a free cd be shipped to you right?
[08:43] <boxgamex> yes, but that takes forever
[08:43] <nothlit> dnite, give me a sec and i'llfind the file, all it requires is putting the modules name in the disabled=" " section
[08:43] <boxgamex> thats how i got these 5.10 cds
[08:44] <psusi> you got a local library with a high speed connection or something?
[08:44] <psusi> maybe local college?
[08:44] <nothlit> boxgamex, you can always use a download manager with resume and d/l over several days, itll still be faster than waiting for shipit
[08:44] <dnite> nothlit, awesome.. so install build essentials, add nvidia to restricted modules.. and run nvidia's install script? cool. thanks.

[08:45] <Arepie> .gcwdtheme <-- what extension is this ? and how to install it/

[08:47] <ragnar_123> hey guys!
[08:47] <dcraven> michael, if the libraries are app specific, you may be able to install them in some out of the way place and just point your app (bmpx I guess) to them when you compile it.
[08:47] <dnite> nothlit, beat me to it. thanks a lot.
[08:47] <psusi> rccollins: yes, of course
[08:47] <nothlit> dnite, yw
[08:48] <Jowi> rccollins, depends on what you are doing exactly. copying files alot? then client and server CPU speed, harddisk speed, network connection and how you connect it all (switch, router etc) got its role
[08:48] <michael> dcraven, thanks for the help.  I'm going to try installing them in /usr and if it breaks, no big deal.  I'm not going to lose any data

[08:48] <rccollins> My next question is this.  Is there a program similer to "Streamtuner" but for video sources?
[08:48] <willwork4foo> lo y'all. anyone know much about wifi settings in Ubuntu? I had everything working perfectly before, until I had to replace my wireless router because the old one died - now, whenever I plug the PCMCIA wifi card into my Ubuntu laptop it tries to connect to the old wireless network instead of the new one - I have to go in and do a sudo iwconfig and set it up manually every time now
[08:48] <Jowi> rccollins, your question is a bit too general.
[08:48] <nothlit> dnite, nvidia
[08:48] <nothlit> dnite, or nvidia-glx
[08:48] <dcraven> michael, okay.
[08:48] <willwork4foo> can anyone suggest how I might resolve this?
[08:49] <dnite> nothlit, ok. thanks again..
[08:49] <dcraven> michael, if it does break something, you could just reinstall the older version from the repos to fix it likely.

[08:55] <JohnM555> I'm just recenetly installed Ubuntu(today) and am trying to set up my wireless device(NetGear WG121 USB) but it doesn't seem like there is a driver for it, so I think I need to use the ndiswrapper, however I'm not really sure how. I am using the 6.10 version with an amd64, could anyone point me to a good site to look at?

It supports hardware acceleration of all X, OpenGL and XVideo applications and graphical effects by a compositing window manager such as Compiz or Beryl. The project was started by David Reveman and first released on January 2,
[08:55] <compudaze> also if you have sudo setup... sudo -i

[08:56] <robbbb> hello.... does anybody know if vmware-server is in any repositries now?
[08:57] <perestroika> hy what do i install ofr programms for apple ipod ? do oyu have any commands please that i can paste on my terminal? thanks
[08:57] <robbbb> perestroika - use amarok
[08:57] <epsilon_> robbbb: i think that vmware server is not free software in any way
[08:57] <perestroika> amarok cant fidn my ipod
[08:57] <perestroika> :/
[08:57] <perestroika> i plug my ipod
[08:57] <perestroika> in
[08:57] <perestroika> and nothing happens
[08:57] <robbbb> vmware server is free in every way
[08:57] <epsilon_> robbbb: vmware player is free and you can use it to run a windows seartc the internet
[08:57] <compudaze> it's not open source, but u can download/run it for free
[08:58] <perestroika> and than amorak doesn't din it  either. im pretty pissed off cos i spent some money on this ipod heh
[08:58] <RickSeymour> whers can i see what your version numbers are for programmes? (i'm using gentoo at the mo)
[08:58] <epsilon_> robbbb: sorry then :)
[08:58] <compudaze> robbbb, just download/install from vmware's site
[08:58] <Kenotic> I forgot who sent me the link for the fixres stuff. That, however, did not fix my problem. Gnome still does not detect the other resolutions I have configured in my xorg.conf file
[08:58] <robbbb> perestroika - add it as a new device under /mnt/ipod
[08:58] <perestroika> hwo do i do that
[08:58] <perestroika> ?
[08:58] <robbbb> compudaze - yeah it doesn't work too well
[08:58] <Kenotic> I want it to give me 1280x1024 and it will only give me my laptops native and 1024x768
[08:58] <compudaze> worked fine for me
[08:58] <Kenotic> any one know of a work around
[08:59] <compudaze> u need to install some dependencies

[08:59] <Kenotic> epsilon_, that is where I went last time and it did not help
[09:00] <Kenotic> resolution on my laptop is fine and gnome works at the resolution. It is just the resolution switch in gnome does not give me the option to change to one that will work with my external monitor for mirroring
[09:00] <robbbb> i've got a weird issue where it unconfigures its self every reboot
[09:00] <robbbb> compudaze - what are they?

[09:01] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[09:01] <epsilon_> Kenotic: the problem lies within xorg.conf but i dont have the knowledge for that (_maybe_ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg press escape until you can select some runnable resolutions)
[09:01] <a_l_e> anyone having already done it?
[09:01] <Kenotic> epsilon_, I call myself having done that
[09:02] <ltr^^^> how do i install opera in edgy?
[09:02] <hume> hi...since I upgraded to edgy, i have a broken package, samba, that I cannot get rid of by choosing either remove or upgrade -anyone got advice?

[09:02] <compudaze> oops
[09:02] <compudaze> robbbb, check out http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_vmware_server

[09:02] <axisys> hwo do i fix the 'Too many open files in system' when i try to access some of the smbfs dir
[09:02] <ltr^^^> how do i fix that ^^
[09:02] <axisys> others are fine
[09:02] <epsilon_> Kenotic: then dunno. :( search forums or post there i think its a quite common problem.

[09:03] <JohnM555> I'm trying to install ndiswrapper, I found this site: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[09:03] <JohnM555> It lists the locations of ndiswrapper for 6.06
[09:03] <epsilon_> ltr^^^: is it a proper .deb file? maybe with a package source? anyway firefox is okay :)
[09:03] <JohnM555> but nothing about 6.10
[09:03] <JohnM555> should I assume its the same as 6.06 Dapper Drake?
[09:03] <ltr^^^> epsilon, firefox keeps crashing
[09:03] <epsilon_> ltr^^^: 2.0?
[09:04] <JohnM555> I forgot...nobody answers my questions here...
[09:04] <ltr^^^> epsilon, yes.
[09:04] <epsilon_> ltr^^^: pff. :(
[09:04] <Tomcat_> JohnM555: I'm not saying it's the reason, but it's difficult to follow your questions when you are using 10 lines over 2 minutes.... :o
[09:04] <ltr^^^> when i run FF from term i get this: libxpt: bad magic header in input file; found '', expected 'XPCOM\nTypeLib\r\n\032'
[09:04] <ltr^^^>  and ff crashes randomly in the next few minutes
[09:05] <JohnM555> Sorry Tom
[09:06] <JohnM555> How about this, I'm trying to install ndiswrapper, the site I found has links for ndiswrapper-utils and ndisgtk for versions 6.06, 5.10, 5.04, but I have 6.10. Should I try the files for 6.06?
[09:06] <shwag> JohnM555: there is an automatic install script for ndiswrapper
[09:06] <mydani2> Hello. I've got a question about firestarter. I added a forwarding rule from firewall-port 80 to ip 192.168.2.99:80 in my home net. But the forward doesn't work. Do I have to enable some options?
[09:07] <JohnM555> oh, where?
[09:07] <rambo3> ltr^^^, ssl apache2 ?
[09:07] <ltr^^^> what ranbo3?
[09:08] <shwag> JohnM555: link is somewhere on the ubuntu wiki
[09:08] <trappist> mydani2: I haven't used firestarter in years, but when you forward a port you have to make sure you allow the traffic both ways, and unless you make an extra rule, you won't be able to hit it from inside your network - it'll only work from the internet

[09:35] <bluefox83> i did a full installation of edgy last night, it works fine :)
[09:35] <pixell^> can someone who uses Dapper, please tell me if they can play the audio file at: http://www.coachradio.com/pages/1/index.htm ?

[09:35] <adam_> flanders, hmmm...
[09:35] <recon0> inglor: could you pastebin your sources.list and errors?
[09:35] <coz_> TheGateKeeper, that works fine also
[09:35] <flanders> adam_  it seemed to work fine before I ran rub-install.
[09:35] <ltr^^^> when i run FF from term i get this: libxpt: bad magic header in input file; found '', expected 'XPCOM\nTypeLib\r\n\032'

[09:35] <recon0> inglor: my thoughts exactly.
[09:35] <adam_> flanders, so, you ran the cmd grub install and it went away? so you are upgrading ubuntu?
[09:36] <Silencer> dv5237, ye i know :/
[09:36] <ozzeh> Anyone have any idea why when I run the NVIDIA driver install it works fine I can start X but then when I reboot it complains that the X modules and Kernel modules versions don't match?
[09:36] <Silencer> looks like it needto be burned on DvD
[09:36] <dv5237> Silencer: where you from ill search the correct .iso for you
[09:36] <coz_> ladydoor, mmm then i won't take up your time because I cannot see the problem first ahdn... however, there are some really good people on tyhe #alsa channel that may be able to help
[09:36] <trappist> ozzeh: probably you rebooted to a different kernel than you were running before
[09:36] <coz_> ladydoor, it may also be #ubuntu-alsa buty I think it is just #alsa
[09:36] <ozzeh> trappist, I'm 100% sure I didn't
[09:37] <ozzeh> I even made sure to check
[09:37] <Symmetria> hey all
[09:37] <ladydoor> coz_: aha. thanks much...i was not aware of that channel.
[09:37] <flanders> adam_  dmesg tells me "ata2: disabling port" - not sure what is causing that, but I think it is related, as I don't get that when I boot from the CD (which uses ISOlinux)
[09:37] <dv5237> Silencer: yeah but the 'normal' .iso can be burned on a cd
[09:37] <maestrotecho> erUSUL: I tried doing dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org. It doesn't give me the option to effect the refresh rate of the monitor.
[09:37] <Symmetria> hrm, can anyone here suggest a better server other than archive.ubuntu to rsync a full mirror from on a regular basis?

[09:37] <adam_> flanders, i was wondering if it got corrupted for some reason. are you updating ubuntu with a cd, or are you doing a fresh install?
[09:37] <TheGateKeeper> coz_: well unless the updates have finally come through that have done the fixes, I know different
[09:37] <dv5237> Silencer: where you from ill search the correct .iso for you

[09:40] <flanders> adam_  I've tried that - reseated the CD-rom unit several times.
[09:40] <BlueEagle> flanders: And your CD-ROM is it IDE or SCSI? Are your harddrives IDE, SCSI or SATA?
[09:40] <ladydoor> SB|nblracer: right. so what window manager or desktop environment do you use?

[09:40] <SB|nblracer> ladydoor gnome
[09:40] <adam_> its a laptop, its ide
[09:40] <flanders> BlueEAgle:  HDs are SATA.  I think that the CD-rom is also connectd via a SATA bus, given some of the messages in dmesg...
[09:40] <adam_> ah
[09:40] <BlueEagle> fabrifibra: Which language is that?
[09:40] <ladydoor> SB|nblracer: oh...hmm. i think there's a Session Settings option in one of the menus
[09:40] <adam_> kk
[09:40] <adam_> now i get it
[09:41] <ladydoor> SB|nblracer: that should do it, if i recall
[09:41] <adam_> your losing your sata controller, or its not resetting
[09:41] <SB|nblracer> k
[09:41] <flanders> BlueEagle - I think that the whole system is just SATA.  It is a loptop, so a little bit harder for me to tell..
[09:41] <maestrotecho> ubuntu is auto-detecting my monitor to be 85Hz, I am setting low horiz/vert rates, and ubuntu keeps kicking it up to 85Hz!
[09:42] <adam_> flanders, i didnt think they made laptops with sata yet, but i could be wrong. if you have that, its understandable that you could be losing the controller, or its not being reset fully
[09:42] <BlueEagle> flanders: Well if you mount your cd as /dev/sd* in linux then it's scsi or sata.

[09:48] <flanders> adam_  I have tried booting without a CD inteh drive, with a CD in the drive, with the drive removed from the laptop and re-inserting once booted, etc.
[09:49] <black_13> seth_| or your saying this will pull xorg along with it?
[09:49] <seth_|> apt-cache search only searches.
[09:49] <adam_> flanders, this is a weird one for me man, i am sorry i probably cant say i know what to do. It cant be a corrupted cd, as it shouldnt affect the other partition
[09:49] <flanders> When I re-inserted the drive, it didn't make any mention in the /var/log/messages file (like you get for USB inserts, etc.)

[09:50] <flanders> Adam_ :  any ideas about where I should follow up?
[09:50] <adam_> flanders, or edit grub
[09:50] <seth_|> can anyone recommend a good latest motherboard for edgy?
[09:50] <Pelo> Markive,  I have a ntfs diskmounter I can send you
[09:50] <seth_|> i'd like to use AMD
[09:51] <Synyster> does anyone know the code to install mp3 codec?
[09:51] <flanders> adam_:  is there a lilo package for edgy?  (I haven't looked yet.)
[09:51] <Markive> i need to get files out of my ntfs partition
[09:51] <beetle11011> I run vmware-server on an edgy host.
[09:51] <adam_> flanders, im not 100 percent sure, but i would think so
[09:51] <adam_> !lilo
[09:51] <ubotu> lilo is an alternative [Li] nux Boot[Lo] ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.
[09:51] <Markive> pelo can ii get it from the repositorys?
[09:51] <adam_> flanders, do you think you have a corrupted down load or burn?
[09:51] <bipolar> beetle11011: any issues runing it?
[09:51] <beetle11011> vmware-workstation, or player should have similar requirements.
[09:51] <Pelo> Markive,  I think yiou can use  ntfs-3g from the repo that will do the same thing, but I haven'T tried it yet
[09:51] <flanders> adam_ :  no, I checked the CD.
[09:52] <beetle11011> bipolar:  none.
[09:52] <slinky_> hi, firefox shows vlc plugin for wmv files on about:plugins but they don't display and must be saved to file, any ideas?
[09:52] <beetle11011> bipolar:  you?
[09:52] <bipolar> beetle11011: hmm... when I try to run vmware, it just hangs. I have to kill it. no UI ever comes up.
[09:52] <flanders> adam:  let me check the grub version...
[09:52] <Synyster> does anyone know the code to install mp3 codec?
[09:52] <slinky_> Ljl: hello
[09:52] <beetle11011> did you update your kernel, or do a dist-upgrade after you installed vmware?
[09:52] <dv5237> Synyster: !restricted | Synyster
[09:53] <adam_> flanders, man, im tellin ya, thats a tough one im stumped
[09:53] <beetle11011> bipolar:  if you did, you need to re-run the vmware-config.pl script.
[09:53] <flanders> adam_: Version: 0.97-11ubuntu14
[09:53] <Markive> pelo thanks
[09:53] <bipolar> beetle11011: no. I did the upgrade from dapper, then installed the latest version of vmware.
[09:53] <dv5237> Synyster: !restricted | dv5237
[09:53] <flanders> adam_:  I couldn't find anything on google - I knew it was bad then...
[09:53] <Synyster> !restricted
[09:53] <adam_> thats the one i have... im pretty sure, do you want me to wire you my copy, and try it?

[09:54] <beetle11011> bipolar:  when you run vmware from the terminal, what does it say?
[09:54] <kaffeewoller> hi. how do i find out which processes use /dev/dsp?
[09:55] <bipolar> beetle11011: all it says is the same thing it always has, it complains a bit about libpng12.so.0: no version information available
[09:55] <adam_> flanders, do you want me to wire you my copy of grub, or do you want to try another download? i have also seen a bad burn do some weird things
[09:55] <Synyster> yhanks
[09:55] <bipolar> beetle11011: but it always just went right though and ran anyway.
[09:55] <flanders> adam_:  I'm pretty confident that it is a good package.  I'll see if I can verify it.
[09:55] <Wulfie> how hard is it to install the nvidia drivers manually in Ubuntu?
[09:55] <Synyster> alright its on my desktop now how to i install it?
[09:56] <adam_> flanders, thats all i can say... im exhausted on it if its affecting two different operating systems.
[09:56] <compudaze> Wulfie, it's not hard
[09:56] <flanders> adam_:  thanks for the help.
[09:56] <adam_> flanders, sorry i couldnt fix it
[09:56] <Wulfie> compudaze: can I just run the .run package?  Do I need to remove the apt-get stuff?
[09:56] <flanders> no worries.

[09:57] <beetle11011> bipolar:  I would try un-installing, and re-installing vmware.  This process should tell you if the dependencies on your system have been messed up.  Of course, make sure you don't wipe out your vmware workstation.
[09:57] <beetle11011> bipolar:  I mean your guest os's.
[09:57] <Markive> :( i can't see my ntfs partition :(
[09:57] <kaffeewoller> i think something is blocking my sound device /dev/dsp. how can i find out who that is?
[09:58] <bipolar> beetle11011: I'm going to try rebooting, just in case there was a lib thats not being inited properly. I'll also try a reinstall.
[09:58] <epsilon_> slinky_: no ideas really i dont even know what vlc is ...
[09:58] <bipolar> beetle11011: thanks
[09:58] <Pelo> Markive,  did you run diskmounter ?
[09:58] <Markive> vlc is the best media player
[09:58] <f0xmuld3r> can anyone help me with LVM on Edgy server version?
[09:58] <beetle11011> bipolar:  before you re-install, and after you reboot, try re-running vmware-config.pl
[09:58] <epsilon_> ahh :S
[09:58] <Markive> pelo i don't really know how

[10:01] <Markive> it says its mounted but i can't see or what touse to browse it
[10:01] <Markive> brouse*
[10:01] <beetle11011> any information on getting a firewire hdd working with edgy?
[10:01] <epsilon_> slinky_ : i dunno :( i just remeber that there is mplayer and a plugin in the repo, and some time before i used mplayer plugin and _maybe_ it played wmv :)

[10:03] <bipolar> beetle11011: yeah. I ran it once already
[10:03] <beetle11011> bipolar:  just give it a "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[10:04] <beetle11011> bipolar:  that should get the headers installed.

[10:24] <f0xmuld3r> Just posted a message on Ubuntu forums
[10:24] <f0xmuld3r> Bur I see a lot of questions about LVM and no real answers
[10:24] <f0xmuld3r> Guess I will fall back to SUSE then: at least it has a decent installer
[10:25] <Kannix_> f0xmuld3r: You are kidding us, right?
[10:25] <tiagoboldt> really.. :S
[10:25] <prestosd> SUSE stinks compared to ubuntu! :)
[10:25] <f0xmuld3r> Ok: tell me why Ubuntu has no option to influence your install?
[10:25] <prestosd> yah
[10:25] <tiagoboldt> f0xmuld3r, if you'r having problems installing, try the alternative install cd
[10:25] <beetle11011> prestosd:  output of dmesg | grep hdb
[10:25] <coz_> f0xmuld3r, could you ecplain that?
[10:25] <prestosd> beetle??? what is that supposed to mean?
[10:25] <coz_> explain
[10:25] <EdHup> Anyone available to help with Synaptic?
[10:25] <dv5237> hehe thats a tactic i have seen before you say the OS stinks ect and some people are stupid enough to help ;)
[10:25] <f0xmuld3r> I need the SERVER version of Ubuntu because it has a LAMP install
[10:26] <beetle11011> prestosd:  command to run?
[10:26] <prestosd> okay
[10:26] <beetle11011> prestosd:  show me the output.
[10:26] <coz_> f0xmuld3r, and did you download the server version?
[10:26] <boink> !pastebin

[10:26] <f0xmuld3r> Yeas
[10:26] <Kannix_> f0xmuld3r: Besides the point, that you can have influence on the installation process by chosing the "expert" mode, with Ubuntu you get a reasonable base system and Synaptic.
[10:26] <bipolar> f0xmuld3r: there is no "server" version of ubuntu.... there is the desktop live-cd and the alternitive cd.

[10:27] <f0xmuld3r> There is a SERVER version
[10:27] <bipolar> dv5237: there is a 'server' installation method on the alternitive cd.
[10:27] <f0xmuld3r> I have it right here

[10:27] <ubotu> prestosd: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:27] <beetle11011> prestosd:  it see's it, you just have to tell the system what to do with it.
[10:27] <prestosd> ?????????
[10:27] <dv5237> bipolar: ans there is a server edition .iso
[10:27] <pj> i want to call
[10:27] <prestosd> so I type !pastebin then paste my results????
[10:27] <pj> with enybody
[10:27] <bipolar> dv5237: Ive never seen it. is it an official iso?
[10:28] <f0xmuld3r> Ok: how does the alternate version differ then from server?
[10:28] <beetle11011> prestosd:  no, go to the website.
[10:28] <bipolar> dv5237: please paste a link to it. I'd like to see it.
[10:28] <pj> ?
[10:28] <prestosd> oh
[10:28] <beetle11011> prestosd:  you paste your output there.
[10:28] <coz_> f0xmuld3r, there is the server install and the desktop install
[10:28] <prestosd> lol
[10:28] <prestosd> why
[10:28] <beetle11011> prestosd:  and past the link here.
[10:28] <dv5237> bipolar: yeah it on ubuntu.com the second picture
[10:28] <coz_> f0xmuld3r,  on the alternative cd unless they changed it
[10:28] <kurisu> can anyonw help me with a firewire problem?
[10:28] <prestosd> that would take forever
[10:28] <f0xmuld3r> Duh: http://www.ubuntu.com/server
[10:28] <beetle11011> prestosd:  keeps the garbage off of the channel.
[10:28] <GaiaX11> how do i disable a user account temporarily?
=== karlarsch is now known as franzturin
[10:28] <prestosd> anyhow
[10:29] <prestosd> what do you think of my results?
[10:29] <dv5237> bipolar: 'The server install CD allows you to install Ubuntu permanently on a computer for use as a server. It will not install a graphical user interface.'
[10:29] <pj> I HAVE UBUNTU 6.10..BUT kaffeine?
[10:29] <beetle11011> prestosd:  like I said though, you just need to partition, and mount your drie?
[10:29] <pj> kakkeine for mpg?
[10:29] <prestosd> how do I do that?
[10:29] <f0xmuld3r> Exactly: I want a server
[10:29] <beetle11011> prestosd:  s/drie/drive
[10:29] <prestosd> typing the command......
[10:29] <pj> where is kaffeine...
[10:29] <beetle11011> prestosd:  hold on.
[10:29] <tiagoboldt> so f0xmuld3r use the alternative install cd and select LAMP installation
[10:29] <f0xmuld3r> Listen: I have installed that server version before: no problems. But how the hell do I install 6.10 using LVM?
[10:29] <prestosd> it didnt do  anything
[10:30] <boink> !language
[10:30] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[10:30] <f0xmuld3r> Fine: but how do I set up LVM?
[10:30] <bipolar> dv5237: interesting. I don't remember that being released with dapper. maybe they added it for .1 or something.
[10:30] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: wasn't there boot/install options for LVM under 6.06?
[10:30] <LGKeiz> Yeah
[10:30] <f0xmuld3r> The install for the alternate is the same as server?
[10:30] <LGKeiz> I give up on Windows
[10:30] <f0xmuld3r> Yes
[10:30] <LGKeiz> I just got my ass pwned
[10:30] <dv5237> bipolar: if im correct dapper whas the first version that had server included
[10:30] <tiagoboldt> f0xmuld3r, apt-get install lvm10?
[10:31] <f0xmuld3r> Under 6.06 LVM was there right away
[10:31] <slavik> LGKeiz: how?
[10:31] <prestosd> beetle11011: still waiting.....
[10:31] <bipolar> f0xmuld3r: I don't know any more. It looks like a diffrent ISO.
[10:31] <tiagoboldt> f0xmuld3r, apt-get install lvm2?
[10:31] <cowbud> what is the summit channel?
[10:31] <tiagoboldt> just install what's missing..
[10:31] <prestosd> summit?
[10:31] <gravyface> apt-cache search lvm
[10:31] <cowbud> yah
[10:31] <prestosd> what is the summit?
[10:31] <cowbud> the channel where you can listen to the talks about ubuntus development
[10:31] <prestosd> is that in colorado?
[10:31] <LGKeiz> slavik: I have some files on my computer which aren't ready for the public ( aka gaming files ) dude got into my system somehow and well gave them to the public.
[10:31] <beetle11011> prestosd:  partition with cfdisk (cfdisk /dev/hdb), format with mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1, and then mount it (mount /dev/hdb1 /whereever)
[10:31] <ninjamike> hey, anyone know where I specify for getty to listen on ttyS0 at boot?
[10:31] <cowbud> the mountain view summit or whatever in cali at google head quarters
[10:31] <f0xmuld3r> apt-get lvm would do a post-install I want to do it while installing the system from scratch
[10:31] <prestosd> k, ill try that
[10:31] <cowbud> blah forget it I just remembered I can read about it on the fridge
[10:31] <GaiaX11> Hi. how do i disable an user account temporarily?
[10:32] <boink> you could use vipw
[10:32] <slavik> LGKeiz: do you have a router?
[10:32] <boink> then set the shell to /bin/false
[10:32] <black_13> what minimum package do i need to install to get xorg working?
[10:32] <f0xmuld3r> Look I have my 6.10 right on the screen that says: partition your system, how do I tell Ubuntu to use LVM from there?
[10:32] <Raskall> or man passwd. I think the -d option deletes the password (and thereby disables the account).
[10:32] <slavik> black_13:  ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop, or xubuntu-desktop
[10:33] <thor> GaiaX11: as root change their password and don't tell them.
[10:33] <black_13> thanks
[10:33] <Infecto>  hello
[10:33] <slavik> that is the prefered minimal package
[10:33] <cowbud> #udsmtv
[10:33] <Infecto> i`m trying to do dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
[10:33] <cowbud> if you are interested
[10:33] <prestosd> when i type cfdisk /dev/hdb it says "FATAL ERROR: Cannot Open Disk Drive"
[10:33] <Infecto> hmm i`m trying to switch on the bitmap fonts
[10:33] <Volstrup> Hi! I have the classic mailserver install (postfix+amavis+clamav+spamassassin), but somehow spamassassin is not used and I cannot figure out why. Virus mails are removed as wanted but not spammails. I have incommented the virus and spamlines i 15-content_filter_mode but it's like if amavis does not call SA at all. Any suggestions?
[10:33] <LGKeiz> slavik: yeah and I was dmzed thats why he got access lol
[10:33] <slavik> is there a ping utility that uses port 80?
[10:33] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: try this boot option: debconf/priority=low
[10:33] <mjg> Just installed Ubuntu 6.10 on a Core 2 Duo machine. How can I verify both cores are active?
[10:33] <slavik> LGKeiz: then it's not exactly a windows problem ... :)
[10:34] <ninjamike> hey, can I just create an inittab and things will work, or will that not happen?
[10:34] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/breezy/main/installer-i386/current/doc/manual/en/ch05s02.html
[10:34] <Infecto> but thos command only generating the fonts configuration
[10:34] <f0xmuld3r> Ok, what does that do>
[10:34] <slavik> mjg: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[10:34] <brum> slavik: ping isnt really port based
[10:34] <Raskall> slavik: httping
[10:34] <gravyface> supposed to run in "expert mode" and give more installation options
[10:34] <slavik> brum: I want to send icmp packets on a diff port
[10:34] <Raskall> slavik: sudo apt-get install httping
[10:34] <dv5237> mjg: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_enable_Multicore_Support
[10:34] <LGKeiz> slavik: oh really?.. I have no remote access programs on this computer, so yes it's windows problem when it's so damn unsecure.
[10:34] <slavik> Raskall: ty
[10:34] <f0xmuld3r> The installation system recognizes a few additional boot parameters
[10:35] <f0xmuld3r> debconf: The installation system recognizes a few additional boot parameters
[10:35] <slavik> LGKeiz: you open the ports that you need ...
[10:35] <f0xmuld3r> Ah
[10:35] <prestosd> beetle11011: are you there? When i type cfdisk /dev/hdb it says "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"
[10:35] <slavik> LGKeiz: DMZ is equivalent of opening every port you have open on the system
[10:35] <f0xmuld3r> I already use netcfg/disable_dhcp
[10:35] <slavik> and how do I open port in ubuntu anyway?
[10:35] <dv5237> prestosd: sudo cfdisk /dev/hdb
[10:35] <f0xmuld3r> All ports are open anyway
[10:35] <killo25> you can use firestarter
[10:35] <prestosd> ill try.....
[10:36] <f0xmuld3r> unless you install a firewwall
[10:36] <LGKeiz> My firewall was up
[10:36] <killo25> is a graphical way to use IPtables
[10:36] <slavik> killo25: and how do I open ports?
[10:36] <LGKeiz> which was windows firewall
[10:36] <jkimball4> where is artwork in the fs
[10:36] <prestosd> okay, it started
[10:36] <Raskall> slavik: np
[10:36] <prestosd> thanks
[10:36] <brum> slavik: ICMP and TCP ports are on differnt layers, you cant "ping" port 80
[10:36] <mjg> slavik: what info should it display? model name: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU     6600  @ 2.40GHz, cpu MHz: 1596.000
[10:36] <f0xmuld3r> check the man for the firewall you use
[10:36] <killo25> using firestarter
[10:36] <f0xmuld3r> ah
[10:36] <brum> you can telnet host.com 80 and check for a reply
[10:36] <f0xmuld3r> check the man for firestarter
[10:36] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: The Ubuntu Alternate CD uses the text installer instead of the GUI installer. It needs less system memory and permits advanced installs with pre-seeded options as well as LVM or RAID disk configurations.
[10:36] <slavik> mjg: hang on, I'll give you a sample
[10:36] <f0xmuld3r> Ok I will download that one!
[10:36] <Raskall> brum: httping does what he wants. But you are right. It's not icmp
[10:36] <LGKeiz> Im so going to find out how he got access
[10:37] <slavik> !pastebin
[10:37] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:37] <killo25> use synaptic and install firestarter it is very easy to use
[10:37] <f0xmuld3r> Thanks for the tip: but the server version DOES officially also provide LVM!
[10:37] <beetle11011> prestosd:  you will need to use sudo on all of those commands
[10:37] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: let me know how it goes.  I'm too chicken to install Edgy :)
[10:37] <Infecto> ok
[10:37] <Infecto> it works
[10:37] <f0xmuld3r> According to the specs the server version actually also has LVM
[10:37] <beetle11011> prestosd:  also, the /whereever is supposed to be wherever you want to mount the filesystem.
[10:37] <slavik> mjg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30547/
[10:37] <slavik> somethign like that
[10:37] <brum> raskall: i didnt see what he wanted to use it for, and i have not used httpping before, will check it out
[10:38] <skreet> If I'm doing general development in ubuntu do I need to install a special package to have all the standard c/c++ headers?
[10:38] <slavik> so, firestarter, where exactly do I open a port?
[10:38] <ninjamike> a quick question for the gallery: in ubuntu edgy, how do I direct it to spawn a getty over ttyS0?  I'm used to doing it through inittab, which is not there
[10:38] <Raskall> brum: one p only. :) it "pings" web servers with a http request and returns a "pong" if port 80 is answering.
[10:38] <mjg> slavik: Thanks. Thats what I thought. I only show processor 0.
[10:38] <ifireball> anybody knows a step-by-step apache mod_ssl setup guide?
[10:38] <f0xmuld3r> Anway: I am scanning the info for the alternate version but I do not see any reason to use it since the Server version of edgy also has LVM
[10:38] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: it probably does support LVM but perhaps you need to try the "expert mode" to select it.
[10:39] <slavik> mjg: you need the -smp kernel
[10:39] <f0xmuld3r> No: LVM is in the partition menu
[10:39] <f0xmuld3r> It just doesn't seem to work
[10:39] <franzturin> hello
[10:39] <slavik> linux-generic-smp or something like that
[10:39] <beetle11011> prestosd:  so, for example, you could make a directory under mnt called hdb, and then mount it like "mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb"
[10:39] <franzturin> i like cooking
[10:39] <whyameye> if I wanted to load xmms, say, in workspace 2 from the command line, how would I do this (Gnome?)
[10:39] <franzturin> does anyone else like cooking???????????
[10:39] <f0xmuld3r> So I need to know what exact steps there are
[10:39] <franzturin> lets make a cookchannel
[10:39] <dv5237> mjg: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_enable_Multicore_Support
[10:39] <franzturin> for people, that like cooking!!!
[10:39] <gravyface> I'm going to try with now
[10:39] <mjg> slavik: Yes. I think the generic is correct. Then Select from Grub?
[10:39] <beetle11011> prestosd:  sorry, "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb"
[10:40] <slavik> mjg: yes ... you can edit the menu.lst to have the smp boot by default
[10:40] <ifireball> ninjamike: since I didin't have the time to study the new init system yet all I can sujject is that you "grep -R getty *" in your /etc dir
[10:40] <slavik> or remove the non smp kernel
[10:40] <Delkster> skreet, having the build-essential package installed should bring you the C++ standard library
[10:40] <slavik> gtg, have fun
[10:40] <skreet> Delkster: thanks.
[10:40] <Linuturk> my wireless connection is working, and I can scan for access points via the terminal, but the Networking

[10:41] <ninjamike> ahh, event.d
[10:41] <ninjamike> duh, thanks

[10:42] <dv5237> franzturin: please calm down
[10:42] <tiagoboldt> ompaul, :)
[10:42] <slavik> mjg: it just involves changing the defaultboot option towards the beginning
[10:42] <prestosd> wait, I cant mount it
[10:42] <myavuzselim> It does not refresh the graphics when it displays a subscript
[10:43] <prestosd> it says "mount point /mnt/hdb does not exist
[10:43] <prestosd> i formatted everything alright though
[10:43] <slavik> prestosd: does /mnt/hdb directory exist?
[10:44] <slavik> as in, mkdir /mnt/hdb
[10:44] <prestosd> lete me check
[10:44] <slavik> you mount a drive to a directory
[10:44] <slavik> unix/linux does not have multiple root directories like windows does

[10:45] <slavik> have fun guys
[10:45] <Linuturk> does anyone know why the list of available wireless networks wouldn't show up in the Networking applet in Edgy in Gnome? My wireless works fine, but it isn't scanning via the applet, just the terminal.
[10:45] <Paddy_EIRE> can anyone help me get my Radeon 9250 card working
[10:45] <prestosd> mkdir /mnt/hdb didnt give an error
[10:46] <prestosd> but I still cant find the drive
[10:46] <Paddy_EIRE> i mean direct rendering enabled
[10:46] <qatsi> how do i use my gnome theme(icons etc..) with beryl ?
[10:46] <gravyface> f0xmuld3r: oh yeah, adding that "expert mode" opens up alot more options.  hit F6 when the CD boots up and add that debconf/priority=medium string to the end of the other options and hit ENTER
[10:46] <Linuturk> Network Manager can see them, but I removed it because it was locking up my machine
[10:46] <Linuturk> should I try Wifi Radar?
[10:47] <prestosd> i still cant find my new drive!!
[10:47] <prestosd> slavik? you there?
[10:47] <dav1n_> prestosd: explain your problem to me, ill try to help you, just relax :-)
[10:47] <prestosd> k
[10:47] <prestosd> sorry
[10:47] <prestosd> :)
[10:47] <dav1n_> prestosd: np, furstration is part of the job xD
[10:48] <prestosd> lol, thanks man

[10:49] <prestosd> I think its hdb
[10:49] <ifireball> Kannix: I'm using it, not for a very long time though
[10:49] <prestosd> but I dont know where that is
[10:49] <thor> prestosd: is it a usb drive?
[10:49] <prestosd> no
[10:49] <n0dl|laptop> hello whenever i sudo apt-get update i get this error message http://pastebin.com/819283
[10:49] <prestosd> its an internal drive
[10:49] <dav1n_> prestosd: IDE or SATA
[10:49] <kurisu> df
[10:49] <prestosd> ide
[10:49] <thor> prestod: OK....just a sec
[10:49] <prestosd> i think
[10:49] <dav1n_> prestosd: first/only ide drive in the pc?
[10:49] <prestosd> the cable is ide atleast
[10:49] <prestosd> no
[10:49] <prestosd> its set as slave
[10:50] <prestosd> there is 1 other hd
[10:50] <prestosd> set as master
[10:50] <prestosd> the one im booted in right now
[10:50] <dav1n_> prestosd: okay, how many c/dvd drives do you have?
[10:50] <prestosd> 2 cd drives
[10:50] <prestosd> 1 is a burner
[10:50] <dav1n_> prestosd: also please dont spam the channel and try to make long sentences (just heads up)
[10:50] <prestosd> k
[10:50] <prestosd> sorry
[10:50] <prestosd> lol, im doing it again
[10:51] <dav1n_> prestosd: ok, go into the bios and tell me if your c/dvd drivers are on Ch.1 and your harddisks on Ch.3
[10:51] <prestosd> how do you do that?
[10:51] <makkk> how can i clear any settings that may have applied to a second screen? its calling my xserver to crash
[10:51] <dav1n_> prestosd: when you bootup your PC theres something in a corner like 'F1: setup'
[10:51] <prestosd> oh yah
[10:52] <prestosd> but what should i look for?
[10:52] <prestosd> because I'll have to logout of this chat
[10:52] <ifireball> makkk: edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
[10:52] <thor> dav1n_: fdisk -l will tell all the available partitions for him
[10:52] <Gnonthgol> I can't open https sites in firefox.
[10:53] <makkk> ifireball, its not that. i've messed with it a bunch. nothing worked. i created a new user, and all of the sudden all problems gone. same xorg.conf file though. so its some settings that need to manipulate
[10:53] <prestosd> hello? you guys still there?
[10:53] <thor> prestosd: are you in windows or ubuntu now?
[10:53] <dav1n_> prestosd: look in a corner, mostly its f1, f10, del or such things
[10:53] <prestosd> Im in ubuntu still? i didnt do anything
[10:53] <Sutur> I have two large drives, one installed inside the box, and another in an external drive that I consider my backup. I ONLY turn it on to back up. Previously I have just been copying and pasting from one drive to another to backup, but is there a safer option?
[10:53] <thor> prestosd: open a terminal window
[10:54] <prestosd> okay
[10:54] <prestosd> Its open
[10:54] <Kannix_> Sorry, I crashed. So, is anyone using Evolution for mail?
[10:54] <Pabloooo> hi when accesign a locl .php file the browser (firefox) doesnt show the file . instead it tries to download it! ideas?
[10:54] <ifireball> makkk: in that case those setting will probably be in some dodtfile (file whose name begins with a dot) in your home dir
[10:54] <makkk> ifireball, i would be able to login, and before all icons/shortcuts/system tray items would load, xserver would crash... but it worked for a few seconds. and now, with a new user it all works fine
[10:54] <kamui> what . dir do I delete to reset all of my gnome settings?  is it .gconf?
[10:54] <thor> prestosd: now type 'sudo fdisk -l' in the terminal and enter your password when asked
[10:54] <Wulfie> hey folks - I just installed Edgy - I have also installed kde - but either gnome or kde I can't seem to use ctrl-alt + to change my res
[10:54] <Wulfie> any ideas why?
[10:54] <makkk> ifireball, thanks. i was wondering if there was an easier way :)... there are a lot of dot files
[10:54] <ifireball> makkk: the .xsession-errors file in your home dir may give you a hint
[10:55] <makkk> hmm... sounds good. i'll look at it
[10:55] <Gnonthgol> Pabloooo: set the "Content-type" header in the php file
[10:55] <dav1n_> kamul: try .gdm .gnome .gconf that kind of stuff, dont know which it is though, theres an option in nautilus to show hidden .-dirs :)
[10:55] <Daniel4711> Anyone have any idea why "wget -r http://bullet.homelinux.com/" doesn't fetch recursively?
[10:55] <prestosd> okay, do you want to know the results?
[10:55] <thor> prestod: it should show you a list.../dev/hda1 /dev/hda2, etc
[10:55] <ifireball> makkk: it'll probably be called something similar to the app that made it
[10:55] <thor> prestod: is there an hdb?
[10:55] <prestosd> yes
[10:55] <dav1n_> Daniel14711: =R instead of -r?
[10:55] <qc__> is xgl a waste of time??? :)
[10:56] <amichai> can someone tell me what the txt-only chat client is that supports msn, yahoo etc like gaim
[10:56] <Daniel4711> dav1n_, Nah -R is Reject :)
[10:56] <kamui> dav1n_:  Ill try all of them
[10:56] <dav1n_> qc__: thats an opinion
[10:56] <dav1n_> amicahi: aMSN
[10:56] <thor> prestosd: is there a mount point shown for hdb1? (the system column)
[10:56] <tiagoboldt> qc__, it's eye candy, but after some time, just some pointless efects
[10:56] <dav1n_> aicahi: oh nvm, dont know any text-only
[10:56] <prestosd> it says linux
[10:56] <amichai> dav1n_: not that one, it was another one, u could use all the chats
[10:56] <qc__> tiagodboldt: was just curious
[10:56] <tiagoboldt> qc__, but it is worth the try!
[10:56] <prestosd> (under the system column)
[10:56] <dav1n_> amicahi: Kopete?
[10:56] <thor> prestosd: oops...nope...wait one. right...now type 'mount' in the terminal and see if hdb1 is mounted
[10:57] <qc__> tiagoboldt: i actually have it installed on my other box - but i wanted peoples opinions, its pretty much useless lol - other than swingy windows.
[10:57] <amichai> dav1n_: like kopete but only for terminal no x
[10:57] <Gnonthgol> Anyone having problem with https in firefox?
[10:57] <tanath> when i try to install opera, it says package not found, but i have this in my sources.list (which i've updated): deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[10:57] <dav1n_> amichai: sorry, I only know of terminal IRC clients like irssi/bitchx
[10:57] <tanath> Gnonthgol, not i
[10:58] <prestosd> i dont see any hdb's that it mounted
[10:58] <dasua> hello
[10:58] <Pabloooo> Gnonthgol: ok so its a problem inside the php file?
[10:58] <thor> prestosd: right...no problem. We need a directory name for hdb....what would you like to call it?
[10:58] <CVirus> !upgrade
[10:58] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[10:58] <prestosd> well, how about hdb?
[10:58] <prestosd> lol
[10:58] <dav1n_> prestosd: I would use like dvdburner or something
[10:58] <_tg_> I am having problems connecting to my wireless network on my laptop can someone help me
[10:58] <JohnM555> Hey, I need to install the driver for my netgear wireless with ndiswrapper, I have the files on my usb drive, and I know(think) the command I need to use is 'ndiswrapper -i netwg121.inf', but I'm not sure if there is a certain place I need to put it. Can anyone tell me?
[10:58] <dasua> any body now how to install ubuntu from a ftp or http server?
[10:58] <Daniel4711> Ok found out why - a very aggressive robots.txt on the server in question.
[10:59] <prestosd> except its a hd
[10:59] <Daniel4711> -erobots=off works fine
[10:59] <thor> prestosd: OK....now in the terminal type 'sudo mkdir /media/hdb'
[10:59] <dav1n_> prestosd: okay, maxtor? 80gb? 2ndhd or something
[10:59] <Gnonthgol> Pabloooo: It is a problem with the web server saying to Firefox it is a php file and not a html file
[10:59] <JohnM555> If anyone needs me to reword my question, just ask :)
[10:59] <prestosd> i just did this a second ago, only i typed mkdir /mnt/hdb
[10:59] <RawSewage> whats the shell script command to upload a file to a remote server that requires username/password
[11:00] <Pabloooo> Gnonthgol: ok ill try it . i apreciate your help thanks! :)
[11:00] <segfault> RawSewage, scp maybe
[11:00] <thor> prestosd: ok...in the terminal type 'ls -l /mnt' and see if the directory hdb exists
[11:00] <prestosd> okay, i made /media/hdb
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
[11:00] <RawSewage> segfault, ok ty
[11:00] <ifireball> RawSewage: depends on the type of server
[11:00] <RawSewage> ifireball, Linux
[11:00] <prestosd> yep its there
[11:01] <thor> prestosd: ok we will use media. now type in the terminal 'sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb'
[11:01] <ifireball> RawSewage: e.g. http/ftp/ssh/nfs/cifs
[11:01] <RawSewage> ifireball, ty
[11:01] <RawSewage> oh
[11:01] <RawSewage> ifireball, I can use ftp or ssh
[11:01] <prestosd> okay, I typed that
[11:01] <lk11mn> someone help me, im scared.. i just resized my ntfs partition with ntfsresize now i want to delete and recreate the partition so the size matches up...  how do i know the size (in sectors) since the ntfs partition has been resized?
[11:01] <JohnM555> Hey, I need to install the driver for my netgear wireless with ndiswrapper, I have the files on my usb drive, and I know(think) the command I need to use is 'ndiswrapper -i netwg121.inf', but I'm not sure if there is a certain place I need to put it. Can anyone tell me?
[11:01] <thor> prestosd: now type 'mount' and see if hdb1 is in the list
[11:02] <tanath> i can't install opera. it says package not found, but i have this in my sources.list (which i've updated): deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu edgy-commercial main
[11:02] <prestosd> yep its there now
[11:02] <dnite> i just added a new udev rule so my usb hard drive will always be mounted right.. but now, when i mount the usb hard drive, i get 2 icons for it showing up on the desktop instead of just one.. is there any way to either turn off the icons on the desktop or how to fix this so only the one shows up?
[11:02] <LGKeiz> !upgrade
[11:02] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[11:02] <thor> prestosd: ok now your new drive is located at /media/mnt and you can create directories on it or copy files to it etc.
[11:02] <ifireball> RawSewage: for ftp you can use wput (not installed by default, you may need to apt-get it), for ssh you can use scp of sftp
[11:02] <prestosd> cool
[11:02] <RawSewage> ifireball, ok ty
[11:02] <prestosd> but i have one other question
[11:03] <Fastly> anyone else here know how to setup a postfix smtp email server with smtp auth?
[11:03] <tim167> I finally installed ubuntu on my IBM Thinkpad, yippee...but... i chose the wrong keyboard lqyout, how can I change this ?
[11:03] <thor> prestosd: to get the drive added at bootup you need to add a line to /etc/fstab
[11:03] <compudaze> what is the 'next' key?
[11:03] <prestosd> is there any 1 command or something (or anything) that you can use to copy complete filesystems to another hd
[11:03] <dv5237> tim167: System -> Preferences -> Keyboard
[11:04] <tim167> thanks, Ill try that
[11:04] <tanath> can anyone help?
[11:04] <thor> prestosd: a hard drive in linux looks like any other directory, so you can use wildcards just as you would for copying a directory to another directory
[11:04] <prestosd> but would it boot?
[11:04] <dv5237> prestosd: no you dont have a boot manager on that hd
[11:05] <Gnonthgol> I updated to edgy and now firefox can't open https
[11:05] <prestosd> urg
[11:05] <prestosd> how can I?
[11:05] <dv5237> prestosd: not sure if thats possible whitout a clean install
[11:05] <prestosd> hm
[11:05] <prestosd> okay
[11:05] <Intangir> how do i see what libraries an exe loads? ldd doesnt work on exes
[11:06] <thor> prestosd: you want to dual boot with windows?
[11:06] <tim167> dv5237: testing...a//o | |**** yes my keyboard layout is correct now ! thanks!
[11:06] <Intangir> a binary i mean
[11:06] <prestosd> i already am
[11:06] <dv5237> tim167: congrats :) have fun
[11:06] <thor> prestosd: what do you want to boot from the new drive?
[11:06] <tim167> :d
[11:06] <segfault> tanath, try apt-cache search opera see if anything gets returned
[11:06] <flasher> how do i re-install java?
[11:06] <tanath> segfault, yeah, i have config files from when i had it before
=== edulix_ is now known as Edulix
[11:07] <prestosd> I want to copy my current filesystem (configuration and everything) to my 80GB HD for more space, but I don't want to reinstall
[11:07] <dv5237> flasher: sudo apt-get remove --purge <jave.name> && sudo apt-get install <java.name>
[11:07] <segfault> tanath, it is possible they havent populated the commerical repository yet
[11:07] <qatsi> is there any way to get two monitors working ?
[11:07] <tanath> segfault, it's there. i can see it in my browser
[11:07] <thor> prestosd: no need in linux....the 80G is part of the filesystem...if you want to share it with windows you need to reformat it as a fat32 drive
[11:07] <prestosd> nonono i dont want to share it with windows
[11:08] <maxb> Having filed a bug in Launchpad, what's the recommended way to (gently) agitate, if it draws no response?
[11:08] <Arron76> prestosd : copy the filesystem over, then install grub / lilo on the new hd pointing to the new config files
[11:08] <tanath> segfault, i could download it and install it with dpkg, but i'd like to know why it's not working with aptitude
[11:08] <flasher> dv5237: and how do i know the java name?
[11:08] <Gnonthgol> prestosd: you know that the config is in /etc and user profiles is in /home what else do you need to copy?
[11:08] <dv5237> !xinerama | qatsi
[11:08] <ubotu> qatsi: xinerama is using multiple monitors as one big monitor. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo
[11:08] <prestosd> Arron76: how?
[11:08] <dv5237> flasher: is it for firefox?
[11:08] <qatsi> dv5237: at least a howto :D thats what i needed :D thank you !
[11:08] <segfault> tanath, how do u know its there, r looking in pool dir, that would encompass edgy and dapper pkgs in that repository
[11:08] <dv5237> flasher: 'dpkg -l | java'
[11:09] <dv5237> flasher: 'dpkg -l | grep java' sorry
[11:09] <prestosd> Gnonthgol: I don't want to have to reconfig everything!! I have modded ubuntu a lot, other than just my home directory
[11:09] <dv5237> qatsi: you're welcome have fun wont be easy though
[11:09] <thor> prestosd: why bother with all that? the 80G is part of the linux file system and you won't gain anything by moving it all to hdb
[11:09] <tanath> segfault, in pool
[11:09] <flasher> dv5237: well, i have firefox, and java works fine with that. I want to fix java for opera
[11:09] <tanath> segfault, http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/opera/
[11:09] <prestosd> thor: yes i will
[11:10] <Spee_Der> Good afternoon everyone.
[11:10] <dv5237> flasher: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1659144 maybe this will help
[11:10] <Gnonthgol> prestosd: but the only changes in the config is in /etc
[11:10] <thor> prestosd: do you have IM? (yahoo or msn?)
[11:10] <prestosd> yes i have gaim
[11:10] <prestosd> with an aim and msn account
[11:10] <qatsi> brb, xorg.conf is going to be destroyed :D
[11:10] <segfault> tanath, again the pool dir in a repository contains pkgs ffor all distributions in the repository, in this case edgy and dapper, maybe that is a dapper pkg
[11:10] <prestosd> whats your screenname?
[11:10] <thor> prestosd: spnye@yahoo.com on msn
[11:10] <dv5237> hope he made a backup..
[11:10] <prestosd> k
[11:11] <prestosd>  addding you......
[11:11] <black_13> how do you manuall install .deb package?
[11:11] <tanath> segfault, right... :(
[11:11] <kandinski> every time I do a dhclient I get some funky nameservers that a) don't appear on /etc/dhc3/dhclient.conf and b) aren't the nameservers from my ISP
[11:11] <tanath> black_13, sudo dpkg -i package.deb
[11:11] <mo> black_13: sudo dpkg -i
[11:11] <kandinski> where else does /etc/resolv.conf get populated from?
[11:11] <Gnonthgol> any experts on firefox ssl that can tell me why fireefox can't open https
[11:12] <Subhuman> i just installed edgy on my vaio - the frequency scaling panel applet shows the CPU speed changing, but i dont have the option to change the type of scaling (power saving full power etc)., its not at the bottom of the prefs, does any1 know if another packahge is needeD?
[11:12] <tanath> Gnonthgol, check your settings?
[11:14] <rambo3> !info ipcop
[11:14] <ubotu> Package ipcop does not exist in any distro I know
[11:14] <Gnonthgol> tanath: I have checked the about:config, and renamed .mozila but no luck
[11:14] <rambo3> !info ip-cop
[11:14] <ubotu> Package ip-cop does not exist in any distro I know
[11:14] <aj__> does anyone know how to make it so ubuntu doesn't let me click on the touchpad i'm not sure which option in X it is for that
[11:14] <bimberi> rambo3: ipcop is a distribution in itself, not part of one like Ubuntu
[11:15] <rambo3> damn
[11:15] <segfault> Subhuman, read docs on powernowd that is what handles cpu freq scaling, u cant set that from the applet in gnome
[11:15] <rambo3> clarkconnect too?
[11:16] <Subhuman> segfault, umm you can, ive read the applets docs, the screenshot differs from what i see.
[11:16] <lexsus> Does Skype work on Dapper?
[11:17] <RawSewage> yes
[11:17] <RawSewage> whats the script command to enter a password on a password prompt
[11:18] <RawSewage> on a remote host
[11:18] <Subhuman> ?
[11:18] <dv5237> RawSewage: what do you mean?
[11:18] <Subhuman> RawSewage, umm if your trying to ssh
[11:18] <Subhuman> and the password isnt showing as you enter it
[11:18] <RawSewage> I want to upload a file with a script using scp, but the password prompt stops it
[11:18] <Subhuman> that is normal unix behavior
[11:18] <lexsus> RawSewage: how?
[11:18] <Subhuman> RawSewage, ahh.
[11:18] <Subhuman> use ssh keys
[11:18] <Subhuman> !ssh
[11:18] <ubotu> ssh is the Secure SHell protocol (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto). Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows, which can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[11:18] <RawSewage> ty
[11:18] <lexsus> RawSewage: E: Couldn't find package skype
[11:19] <lexsus> is there a SKYPE for Dapper?
[11:19] <Subhuman> hmm, well google "ssh keys", you cna do passwordless logins with it.
[11:19] <Trunkz> Hey folks, small question
[11:19] <RawSewage> lexsus, yes
[11:19] <dnite> i'm getting a very strange problem here.. i have a usb hard drive.. i added a udev rule to so it would always be on the same device.. and added it to fstab .. but if i restart the system, i get a crash saying that fsck exited with error code 9 (probably because the usb hard drive isn't plugged in) .. why is this?
[11:19] <lexsus> RawSewage: E: Couldn't find package skype
[11:19] <RawSewage> lexsus, go to Skype's page
[11:19] <Trunkz> I have a laptop.. fairly old.. (P3 900Mhz, 256MB Ram)
[11:19] <lexsus> RawSewage: skype.com ?
[11:19] <RawSewage> lexsus, I think you have to download the Ubuntu package from skype.com
[11:19] <Trunkz> Is it viable to install Ubuntu, and wud it be fairly responsive?
[11:19] <lexsus> ok cheers
[11:19] <lexsus> RawSewage: does Skype work with dial-up?
[11:19] <RawSewage> lexsus,  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy
[11:20] <lexsus> RawSewage: whats edgy?
[11:21] <webben> lexus: latest release of Ubuntu
[11:21] <Trunkz> Guys?.. Justwanting ur opinion, since I dont have an O/S on the laptop atm
[11:21] <Subhuman> !edgy
[11:21] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[11:21] <RawSewage> lexsus, sorry  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper
[11:21] <Trunkz> its a P3 900Mhz with 256MB Ram
[11:21] <Subhuman> Trunkz, yeah itd be cool
[11:21] <linuxwolf> hi
[11:21] <Subhuman> youd need to use the alternativ einstall cd
[11:21] <Trunkz> Subhuman: wud it be responsive tho? Dont want it to lag
[11:21] <webben> Trunkz, depends what you need to do with it
[11:21] <Subhuman> jus cuz the RAM would mean the live CD would be SLOW
[11:21] <Trunkz> webben: run msn, err.. openoffice? basic stuff really
[11:22] <Trunkz> browse the web :p
[11:22] <Subhuman> Trunkz, yeah i ran ubuntu on a amd 800mhz with 256mb of ram
[11:22] <Trunkz> thats it
[11:22] <Subhuman> it runs better than xp for sure.
[11:22] <Trunkz> ooh k :D
[11:22] <Trunkz> good good
[11:22] <Trunkz> I'm not a noob to linux, so not too worried
[11:22] <webben> Trunkz, gaim and openoffice will be okay; applications will load slowly however
[11:22] <Trunkz> np
[11:22] <Subhuman> Trunkz, well ubuntu is a soft landing if your coming from windows :D
[11:22] <Trunkz> ;p
[11:22] <Trunkz> so.. shud I just go and install the latest ubuntu
[11:22] <Trunkz> or install ubuntu 5.10?
[11:22] <webben> Trunkz, you might do better with a more lightweight solution like Xubuntu ... on the other hand the Gnome desktop is more newbie friendly
[11:23] <Subhuman> Trunkz, go with dapper
[11:23] <Subhuman> its the most stable.
[11:23] <Subhuman> 6.06
[11:23] <Trunkz> I kinda like gnome
[11:23] <bruenig> xubuntu is very nice
[11:23] <lexsus> how can I know if im running 6.06 LTS or 6.10?
[11:23] <Trunkz> Nvr tried xubuntu, and hated kde
[11:23] <lexsus> RawSewage: ?
[11:23] <webben> Trunkz, xubuntu = xfce
[11:23] <webben> it doesn't really matter which you installl
[11:23] <Trunkz> yeah I mean xfce
[11:23] <Trunkz> never really tried that desktop gui
[11:23] <bimberi> Edgy is fine for new installs, and might even be better on older hardware than dapper
[11:23] <webben> you can always apt-get xubuntu-desktop or apt-get kubuntu-desktop
[11:24] <aldwin> can anyone help me, i wanna know more about linux, unix command line administration and stuffs
[11:24] <Trunkz> anyway
[11:24] <lexsus> does xfce run faster on slower systems?
[11:24] <Trunkz> 6.06 or 6.10
[11:24] <Trunkz> So I can start dl'ing
[11:24] <webben> lexsus: that's the theory
[11:24] <Subhuman> Trunkz, 6.06 is more stable,
[11:24] <aldwin> is there any good link where in i can start learning more about linux???
[11:24] <Trunkz> 6.06 it is then
[11:24] <Subhuman> 6.10 has sorta newer apps, but it might crash and burn now and then
[11:24] <Trunkz> aldwin: ubuntuguide.org :)
[11:24] <Subhuman> so 6.06 is prob easier for the new linu user.
[11:24] <aldwin> ah okay
[11:24] <aldwin> thanks trunkz
[11:25] <Trunkz> np :)
[11:25] <kamui> jesus, this is really really unstable
[11:25] <Trunkz> xD
[11:25] <Trunkz> When I installed 6.10, it lagged abit
[11:25] <Trunkz> compared to 5.10 on my laptop a while back
[11:25] <lexsus> kamui: pls dont use the Lords name in vain!  thanks
[11:26] <Trunkz> Gah.. downloading sluggishly
[11:26] <linuxwolf> if i use apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade to edgy ( i have breezy) and , i stop it , when i do it again , the packages downloaded, are not re-downloaded, and are instaled propelly , no ? (dist-upgrade will see if there are packages downloaded and in the correct moment , will install it , within the others downloaded , no ? )
[11:27] <Captain_Redbeard> Hey guys, does anyone have any experience with nvclock?
[11:27] <linuxwolf> so i don't have to use dpkg -i or so
[11:27] <Trunkz> Subhuman, can I not just install 5.10 now, and then upgrade to 6.06?
[11:27] <bimberi> linuxwolf: actually the recommended path is breezy -> dapper -> edgy
[11:27] <kandinski> every time I do a dhclient I get some funky nameservers that a) don't appear on /etc/dhc3/dhclient.conf and b) aren't the nameservers from my ISP
[11:27] <kandinski> where else does /etc/resolv.conf get populated from?
[11:28] <Trunkz> kandinski: not if ur connected to a router :)
[11:28] <Subhuman> Trunkz, yeah of course.
[11:28] <Subhuman> !upgrade
[11:28] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[11:28] <Trunkz> it wont do any funky stuff.. like break a few packages?
[11:28] <Subhuman> umm it shouldnt do.
[11:28] <Trunkz> If not, then I'll jus pop in my 5.10 CD :p
[11:28] <linuxwolf> late , for the next time i will do it , because i have edgy in my repositories , and is downloading know (dist-upgrade)
[11:29] <FirstStrike> oh boy
[11:29] <FirstStrike> cross your fingers on that one linuxwolf
[11:29] <seth_|> Hirvinen: can anyone recommend any good modern motherboards which support AMD processors?
[11:29] <FirstStrike> Oh, you bet
[11:29] <bimberi> linuxwolf: anyway, dist-upgrade won't redownload packages, it resumes
[11:29] <Trunkz> seth_|: Asus
[11:29] <Trunkz> DFI if ur pushing i :P
[11:29] <Trunkz> it*
[11:29] <linuxwolf> ok
[11:29] <Eric44> I've always had problems using dist-upgrade. Just re-installing seems to work best.
[11:29] <Trunkz> but Asus is the way to go ;)
[11:30] <FirstStrike>  EPoX EP-9U1697GLI Socket 939 ULi M1697
[11:30] <Trunkz> Well I kinda dont have time atm
[11:30] <AlReece45> My sound works with most of ubuntu, but I can't seem to get it working with games running with wine
[11:30] <FirstStrike> That's an awesome mobo
[11:30] <seth_|> Trunkz: Ubuntu 'Edgy' will run on something like Asus + K2 4000+ ??
[11:30] <Fastly> anyone here got smtp auth working for postfix on edgy?
[11:30] <cryptonic> Does anyone know why the search option in gnome isn't finding files like emails etc?
[11:30] <Trunkz> .. it'll run on a P3 900Mhz
[11:30] <Trunkz> :p
[11:30] <FirstStrike> seth_|: Uh yes...
[11:30] <Trunkz> So ofcourse it'll run on an X2 4000+
[11:30] <nazgjunk> oy
[11:31] <lupine_85> Fastly: works in dappr
[11:31] <lupine_85> dunno about edgy though (IMO it's not really a great idea to have an edgy server ;) )
[11:31] <seth_|> FirstStrike: cool.. don't know if i should be waiting for the next release of Ubuntu..simply because it would have a newer stock kernel.
[11:31] <FirstStrike> I've seen ubuntu running on a 200 mhz laptop
[11:31] <seth_|> Old hardware is fine.
[11:31] <nazgjunk> ive got a few 6.06 lts cd's here... if i install it, will i have a compiler? because i'll need that to get internet working
[11:31] <lupine_85> ubuntu will run on a 386SX :p
[11:31] <seth_|> it's the new ones.. i had problems with like the Intel DG965RY boards
[11:32] <lupine_85> nazgjunk: yes, you will
[11:32] <FirstStrike> Even with the newest hardware I've never had any issues.
[11:32] <nazgjunk> yay
[11:32] <nazgjunk> then i may consider installing it :)
[11:32] <lupine_85> just install "build-essential" (it's on the CD) and you're away
[11:32] <FirstStrike> I just installed this new mobo a few days ago and it runs like a champ
[11:32] <needhelp> Hi, need help, I cant switch between users anymore. When clicking Quit->Switch User, what appears is a just a password-prompt for <this> user, instead of a new userlogin which is what is excepted.
[11:32] <seth_|> FirstStrike: maybe it was just the bad Intel board woes on my part then.
[11:32] <linuxwolf> is so bad to upgrade to edgy , directly , instead of fist upgrade to dapper ? ( i have just re-installed ubantu , the saturday , and it doesn't have any aditional package installed )
[11:33] <black_13> what does the following mean http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/CgwcMb25.html
[11:33] <lupine_85> linuxwolf: rreally really really bad
[11:33] <seth_|> Also.. any way to get the nifty effects on Edgy .. like FC 6 has?
[11:33] <ey> hello how does this "write" command work .cause i want to send on of my friends a message .yeah we are on server and chatting but wanna know .how to write a letter to my friend
[11:33] <FirstStrike> There is some hardware that ubuntu will have trouble with; though I've never seen anybody with an unsupported motherboard before. It's usually their wireless card or sound card.

[11:37] <ifireball> ey: or you can do this in one line with echo "your msg here" | write <username>
[11:37] <Tokenbad> he will enter his username and then it just says connection failed...and logoff....without even asking for password

[11:48] <worldplay_RapidF> bruenig msg me plz
[11:48] <bruenig> worldplay_RapidF, you would edit, the menu.lst and put windows on the top of the list
[11:49] <ZirJoker> haahaha
[11:49] <ZirJoker> needhelp those are... work areas like other desktops
[11:49] <AlReece45> Zirjoker: same here, just for games. Its not like the games I want to run are very new and require much anyway. the most requiring ones are Half Life and Diablo II :-(
[11:49] <asdf_> my SSID is somehow defaulted not to my home network in network-admin.  does anyone know a way to change this?
[11:49] <ZirJoker> it is very useful
[11:49] <worldplay_RapidF> bruenig msg me plz
[11:49] <black_13> what i enter ifconfig i dont see wlan0 what yould cause that?

[11:50] <asdf_> Anyone know how to change your default SSID in network-admin?
[11:50] <AlReece45> ZirJoker: no sound in wine. can't seem to fix it. :-/
[11:50] <ZirJoker> Alreece45 x_x that sucks
[11:50] <worldplay_RapidF> bruenig: then what
[11:50] <bruenig> worldplay_RapidF, that's it.
[11:50] <worldplay_RapidF> ? how do i set a timelimit?
[11:50] <needhelp> ompaul: Am I logged in twice then? F8 gives me some statusinfo (no prompt) in console mode
[11:50] <vladi111> hi does anyone know what I need to type into /boot/grub/menu.lst to get WinXp to boot up? I have ubuntu booting off my master HD, XP is installed on my slave and I also have a separate SATA hd
[11:50] <ompaul> needhelp, yes
[11:51] <bruenig> next time you restart, windows will be on top and there will be a timeout set at 10 by default
[11:51] <ompaul> needhelp, no
[11:51] <worldplay_RapidF> ok cool
[11:51] <ZirJoker> Alreece45 i only play linux games like warsow and nexiuz
[11:51] <worldplay_RapidF> thx ;p
[11:51] <bun-bun> does the default ubuntu kernel have evdev built in?
[11:51] <bruenig> worldplay_RapidF, the menu.lst is located at /boot/grub/menu.lst just so you know
[11:51] <needhelp> ompaul: how do i switch user (without logging out first) ?
[11:51] <worldplay_RapidF> is installing ubuntu like installing windows?
[11:51] <AlReece45> asdf_: network-admin automatically connects to any network you've connected to before. You have to go in with gconf and delete some keys related to the network ssids
[11:51] <ZirJoker> hmmm
[11:51] <cheesy> does a html/css editor come with edgy
[11:52] <ZirJoker> i think desktop with live cd version its much easier than installing windows
[11:52] <ompaul> needhelp, the idea is that you should be able to log in more than once, and if you see :0 and :1 you are logged in, if you use the switch user on dapper it works
[11:52] <ZirJoker> just be carefull with the partition stuff
[11:52] <nasragiel> where can i save a command that it is executed before xorg starts?
[11:52] <bruenig> worldplay_RapidF, when you put the disc it, and you click start or install ubuntu a desktop will show up and there will be an icon on it that says install. Clicking on it will initiate an install and the install is very simple and self explanatory
[11:52] <worldplay_RapidF> ya i alrdy left a 30gb for linux i just reformatted sunday

[11:52] <inglor> hey, where do I get the ubuntu torrent? normal download is kind of slow
[11:52] <AlReece45> asdf_: ALT + FT, then type 'gconf-editor', open /system/networking/wireless/networks
[11:52] <nasragiel> cheesy, every editor is good enough for writing html, take gedit its already installed
[11:53] <worldplay_RapidF> bruenig do you got trillian?
[11:53] <bruenig> worldplay_RapidF, I use gaim
[11:53] <cheesy> thx nasragiel
[11:53] <vladi111> does anyone know what I need to type into /boot/grub/menu.lst to get WinXp to boot up? I have ubuntu booting off my master HD, XP is installed on my slave?
[11:53] <asdf_> AlReece45: in system i don't have networking..only dns_sd gstreamer http_proxy proxy and smb
[11:53] <ZirJoker> you can administrate those 30 gb like... 2 gb for swap memory and 28 to whole linux, just choose to administrate the partitions manually
[11:53] <worldplay_RapidF> gaim?
[11:53] <aztun> hi all
[11:53] <inglor> anyone? where do I download the ubuntu 6.10 torrent?
[11:53] <dilbert> Ill never install XP again.
[11:54] <aldwin> hi too
[11:54] <inglor> grre :/
[11:54] <aztun> may anyone help me?? cant get packet forwarding to work on edgy server
[11:54] <dilbert> inglor, you can get the torrent from the official ubuntu homepage
[11:54] <needhelp> ompaul: Alright, I did altctr-F1 and logged in there. Now command w gives me a new line: "tty1". But the problem is still that the System->Quit->Switch User-option doesnt work properly.
[11:54] <aztun> I allready edit /etc/sysctl.conf
[11:54] <inglor> dilbert, can't find it, mind telling me where I might find it?
[11:55] <nasragiel> where can i save a command that it is executed before xorg starts?
[11:55] <aztun> and then this line iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 192.168.10.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
[11:55] <ompaul> needhelp, what version of ubuntu are u using?
[11:55] <aztun> which worked for me before
[11:55] <aztun> but now doesnt work
[11:55] <sethk> aztun, did you run the command to use the contents of sysctl.conf?  just editing does nothing (unless you restarted)
[11:55] <needhelp> ompaul: 6.06
[11:55] <ey> hello how does this "write" command work .cause i want to send on of my friends a message .yeah we are on server and chatting but wanna know .how to write a letter to my friend  .please someone help me .how does this write command work .i have triyed " write the-nickname and then the message but does not work :S
[11:55] <aztun> I restarte sethk
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-off
[11:55] <sethk> aztun, and you don't need or want iptables rules for most packet forwarding situations
[11:55] <ifireball> ey: write excepts the message to be sent on the standard input, e.g. you type "write <username> [enter] " then type your message and type ctrl+D to finish
[11:55] <aztun> I can see the router using ping, and have route as default gw
[11:56] <sethk> aztun, or do you want to forward selectively?
[11:56] <ifireball> ey: or you can do this in one line with: echo "your msg here" | write <username>
[11:56] <needhelp> ey: write user ttyname
[11:56] <asdf_> AlReece45: any ideas?
[11:56] <aztun> I want to forward everything
[11:56] <aztun> its for my personal lan
[11:56] <AlReece45> asdf_: are sure you sure you're in /system and not /schemas/system?

[11:56] <aztun> I use to get this thing working on other distros in five minuts
[11:56] <sethk> aztun, that doesn't really look right.  for NAT, you would ordinarily specify the public address, not the private one.
[11:56] <sethk> aztun, then why did you switch?
[11:57] <aztun> eth1 is my public iface
[11:57] <sethk> aztun, yes, I know that
[11:57] <aztun> with a pulic ip

[11:58] <kapten> abo, install VLC-player, worked for me.
[11:58] <sethk> aztun, to forward everything, all you need is a default route and packet forwarding enabled.  you don't use a nat rule to forward

[11:59] <sethk> aztun, the purpose of NAT is to translate your private address to a public address on the way out, and back to your private address on the way in.
[11:59] <lupine_85> it's set & read in /proc somewhere - file ip_forward or ip_forwarding
[11:59] <aztun> sethk: I have allways done it in that way and worked for me
[11:59] <sethk> aztun, if eth1 has your publifc IP configured, then you don't use NAT on it.
