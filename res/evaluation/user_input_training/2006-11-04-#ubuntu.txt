[12:01] <cntb> want to rename sources.list thru konqueror so need temp root
[12:01] <engla> /etc/acpi doesn't seem to work. I'm on an ppc ibook
[12:01] <TGPO> angla the 'bum' package can help you with that
[12:01] <kstc> but then i cant use beryl
[12:01] <glick> excuse me, i just installed beagle, but where do i access it from?
[12:01] <cntb> maybe sudo -s konqueror ?
[12:01] <glick> its not on the menu?
[12:02] <TGPO> er engla the 'bum' package can help you set up those scripts
[12:02] <max_>  i was trying to backup my files and i noticed my HD is full but i only have 2 gig of files, can KDE really take up the other 4.5gb on my drive? or is somthing wrong there
[12:02] <avagant> I don't really want to mess with that at all honestly, i just got back on ubuntu after waiting forever with a netboot.
[12:02] <jrib> glick: Places > search
[12:02] <glick> jrib, thats beagle?
[12:02] <glick> looks like regular file search
[12:02] <jrib> glick: should be
[12:02] <epsilon_> max_: no, but there are other programs there (openoffice...), and try tho empty the synaptic cache in the settings
[12:02] <jrib> glick: does help > about, say beagle?
[12:03] <max_> is the synaptic cache similar to temp files in windows?
[12:04] <jStefan> kstc, there are nvidia drivers on the repos, dont know about beryl
[12:04] <epsilon_> max_: no. when you install a package from the internet, it downloads them there, bud doesnt delete them.
[12:04] <max_> oh ok
[12:04] <glick> jrib, no it says yelp
[12:04] <max_> epsilon: where is it?
[12:04] <glick> do i need to log off and back on or something?
[12:04] <max_> epsilon: and are there any other temp files i can clear out?
[12:04] <epsilon_> max_: open synaptic and in the setting window you can set everything :)
[12:04] <TGPO> max__ do 'sudo apt-get clean'
[12:04] <jrib> glick: maybe you need to restart the panel?  You can run beagle in a terminal to see what it should look like
[12:04] <kstc> can i easily backup edgy eft to the default install status?
[12:05] <kstc> so as i installed it
[12:05] <TGPO> max__ that will dump the downloaded files
[12:05] <max_> thank you
[12:05] <epsilon_> max_: there is a temp dir on your computer, but im not sure if its safe to delete it.

[12:06] <Temposs> I recently upgraded from Dapper to Edgy, and I'm having a problem:  When I try to set up new wireless connections with Network Monitor, it never shows the available networks.  If I type in the essid manually it works, but it's really annoying.  It worked perfectly in Dapper.
[12:07] <Juan____> hmmm
[12:07] <Juan____> I've installed x on a mac
[12:07] <kstc> jStefan, can i easily backup edgy eft to the default install status? Or do i have to reinstall it?
[12:07] <Juan____> Exported the DISPLAY on a linux system
[12:07] <Juan____> but I still can't run x programs
[12:07] <Juan____> I get the error: xterm Xt error: Can't open display: 192.168.1.2:0.0
[12:08] <Juan____> Where 192.168.1.2 is the x server (the machine I'm using right now)
[12:08] <Juan____> Does anyone if something else is needed ?
[12:08] <jStefan> kstc, you can, but dont know about easy steps
[12:09] <kstc> so reinstall?
[12:09] <dxdt> Anyone in here know of the gnome.applet module for python and happen to know where the hell I can find it? :-/  I'm trying to make a simple gnome-applet with python but I don't think I have that module as I can't load it using the python interpreter

[12:10] <Milkyy> Hello. When I insert a headset, I can still hear the sound from the speakers...
[12:10] <Juan____> TGPO: Hmm. I'll take a look here. But I suppose that should be the mac os x default...
[12:10] <cntb> on what repo is krusader ?
[12:10] <jStefan> kstc, i'd say try to fix the problem, and if that fails re-install
[12:10] <barnetod> anyone gotta wireless to work eith edgy yet?
[12:11] <max_> epsilon: wow, freed up over 2 gig, thanks
[12:11] <kstc> ok, thanks
[12:11] <erUSUL> barnetod: me (disclaimer i use a self compiled kernel + drivers)
[12:11] <barnetod> im having a persistent problem wifi flashing and never enabling, i have tried everything I could find on forums and what not and get nothing
[12:11] <dxdt> barnetod, mine worked out of the box.  So I guess yes
[12:11] <TGPO> Milkyy headset is a software switch not a hardware switch, most volume controllers have a seperate control for headset
[12:11] <barnetod> er what wireless card you using?
[12:11] <epsilon_> max_: ok cool :)
[12:12] <jStefan> kstc you will have to revert to the default "nv" driver and no beryl for the time being, get -generic working, and then install nvidia-glx from the repos, etc
[12:12] <epsilon_> max_ you can turn off that cache in synaptic settings i think.
[12:12] <robson> i loaded the module for sound (snd-intel8x0) successfully w/ modprobe, but when I do "aplay -l" it tells me no soundcards found...  Any tips?
[12:12] <jaime> hi everybody

[12:12] <jaime> does anyone knows if rythmbox gives support to ipods???
[12:13] <kitche> jaime: it should not sure if ubuntu's package has support for ipods
[12:13] <epsilon_> robson: i also have that module, but it's laoded automatically :S
[12:14] <robson> mine may have been loaded automatically, as there was no difference in error from before and after
[12:14] <robson> both cases result in no soundcard being found

[12:31] <erUSUL> !php
[12:31] <ubotu> lamp is Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.  For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  -  See also the Server CD install menu.
[12:31] <raindog> Question about Firestarter:  In the active connections window it doesn't always remove connections that are no longer open.  Is this a bug, or is there a way to fix this?

[12:39] <cntb> tryin gmplayer
[12:39] <Dimensions> thanks erUSUL ... i will proceed to my first part for channel ...
[12:39] <raindog> Question about Firestarter:  In the active connections window it doesn't always remove connections that are no longer open.  Is this a bug, or is there a way to fix this
[12:40] <cntb> kitche: no joy
[12:40] <demito> i've got a problem with gcc, can anybody help me?
[12:40] <cntb> tried gmplayer on start run
[12:40] <erUSUL> !anyone | demito
[12:40] <ubotu> demito: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[12:40] <tsoler> question: installing new fonts is getting my system getting slow or not?
[12:40] <cntb> what to install for mplayer to work ? is it the totem?
[12:40] <cntb> many players compete for mplayer shortcut or what?
[12:40] <dxdt> what do you mean by work
[12:40] <Dimensions> is there any GUI for php where one can drag drop buttons text boxes etc .. unlike gphpedit
[12:41] <Dimensions> lol erUSUL well both were real ones ...
[12:41] <searey29>  I have a hp laptop with a broadcom wireless card, I have the ndisgtk wrapper I have loaded the .inf files for the card and still cannot get the card to work . My question is this is there any other files I need to put in the wrapper besids the .inf files
[12:41] <dxdt> cntb, do you have mplayer installed?
[12:42] <cntb> dxdt how do I check ? mplayer installed
[12:42] <TGPO> oh sweet jesus
[12:42] <godmachine81> cntb:: apt-cache policy mplayer
[12:42] <cntb> Imust be misunderstanding something is it the totem or other?
[12:42] <cntb> godmachine81: trying that
[12:42] <tsoler> a question concering fonts
[12:42] <Trainstroker> godmachine81: will u be on later tonite?
[12:43] <dxdt> cntb, it isn't installed by default.  If you have not installed it, then you don't have it.
[12:43] <Lethliel> hi folks..
[12:43] <cntb> sudo apt-cache policy mplayer
[12:43] <cntb> mplayer:
[12:43] <cntb>   Installed: (none)
[12:43] <TGPO> tsoler it is unlikelly that installing additional fonts will slow your system down
[12:43] <cntb> http://us.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/multiverse Packages
[12:43] <godmachine81> maybe Trainstroker
[12:43] <dxdt> cntb, you need to install it then.  Use synaptic or type sudo apt-get install mplayer on the command line
[12:43] <godmachine81> cntb:: that means you dont have mplayer installed
[12:44] <godmachine81> lol@synaptic
[12:44] <Keigo-kun> My Synaptic doesn't find anything when I search for "sun-java"
[12:44] <Keigo-kun> what gives?
[12:44] <dxdt> Lethliel, hello
[12:44] <cntb> what is my next step then godmachine81
[12:44] <dxdt> Keigo-kun, probably don't have the universe repos enabled.
[12:44] <cntb> fr mplayer godmachine81
[12:44] <godmachine81> cntb:: sudo apt-get install mplayer ;)
[12:44] <Lethliel> i am new to ubuntu :)
[12:44] <jrib> Keigo-kun: java is in multiverse
[12:44] <Keigo-kun> dxdt, i have all repos enable
[12:44] <jrib> Keigo-kun: what arch?
[12:45] <Keigo-kun> hold on..
[12:45] <Keigo-kun> I think maybe that changed when I upgraded to edgy
[12:45] <gnudna> major changes on 6.10
[12:45] <cntb> Ic apparently I missed the repos
[12:45] <gnudna> no more custom kernels
[12:45] <godmachine81> Keigo-kun:: you need multiverse/universe enabled
[12:45] <cntb> now that I enabled for krusader
[12:45] <tsoler> tgpo: you mean fonts working unlike windows or what?
[12:45] <dxdt> yeah my guess is that you don't have the repos enabled too
[12:45] <cntb> ty godmachine81
[12:45] <godmachine81> sun-java5-bin
[12:45] <cntb> mplayer dl and install ongoing
[12:46] <gnudna> nvidia still detecting nvidia cards wrong always puts pci 0.5.0 instead of pci=1.0.0
[12:46] <TGPO> gnudna, BS I am already running 2.6.18.1
[12:46] <godmachine81> yw cntb
[12:46] <godmachine81> gnudna:: how do you figure
[12:46] <godmachine81> os[Linux 2.6.19-rc3-ttyfscker.1 i686]  distro[Debian testing/unstable]  cpu[1 x Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1.60GHz @ 600MHz]  mem[Physical : 493MB, 46.2% free]  disk[Total : 68.47GB, 33.80% Free]  video[Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller]  sound[] 
[12:46] <godmachine81> that distro is misput in the script
[12:46] <gnudna> but i must say i like the experience of ubuntu 6.10 better than fedora FC6
[12:46] <godmachine81> im on edgy 6.10
[12:46] <gnudna> at the moment
[12:46] <godmachine81> if that kernel isnt custom there isnt a custom one
[12:46] <Lethliel> can you give me a hint what theme to use for a slow machine? i have tried to install blackbox but it doesnt work :(
[12:47] <gnudna> godmachine81, im only allowed to select example 2.6.17-x.x-generic
[12:47] <TGPO> Lethiel use fluxbox, its more recent
[12:47] <Flannel> Lethliel: fluxbox is in universe
[12:47] <godmachine81> gnudna:: thats because those arent custom
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[12:47] <godmachine81> gnudna:: a custom kernel doesnt come from the repo
[12:47] <cntb> godmachine81:  what can best stream fullscreen that link javascript:watchNASALiveTV()
[12:47] <dxdt> Lethliel, hehe, they aren't themes, they are window managers.  I would suggest trying xubuntu depending on the machine.  You can install it by installing xubuntu-desktop and then when you logon, select XFCE as the Session
[12:47] <gnudna> i know i can compile 1 but being lazy is all
[12:47] <gnudna> :(
[12:48] <cntb> sorry again wait godmachine81
[12:48] <Homer_Linux> hiya ppl upgraded to edgy and now when every i run vmware server i get 100% cpu usage ,ive configured it all ready,and build modules but nothing happens
[12:48] <TGPO> Lethiel if you can compile then you know that your first statement was BS when you typed it
[12:48] <Lethliel> i know that they are wm.. but it looks like ubuntu wont let me install another wm properly ^^
[12:48] <godmachine81> gnudna:: well what kind of kernel do you expect to find in the repo? are you meaning an arch specific one? like k7/k8/686/586/486 etc ?
[12:48] <jrib> Lethliel: what happens when you try
[12:48] <gnudna> yes
[12:48] <TGPO> Leth sorry, had your name there was for gnudna
[12:48] <gnudna> exactly what i mean
[12:49] <his_dudnes> hi everyone ,i try to help a lot of friends to install ubuntu, the ine thing that i have trouble supporting them is usb adsl modems, i dont have a usb modem so i cant realy experiment, as i check it out it seems there is no simple solution, no gui etc...If i understand well many guides i found for particular modems require build tools wich needs a working network connection in the first place. I feel like there is something obvius i am missing. If anyone c
[12:49] <his_dudnes> ould provide me with some hints/links  i would appreciate it...
[12:49] <godmachine81> gnudna:: yea they quit doing that because there isnt any differences your going to gain because everything in the repos are compiled with a certain arch
[12:49] <gnudna> ok just wondering
[12:49] <preaction> his_dudnes, yeah, why are they using the USB port when those things usually also have an ethernet port?
[12:49] <gnudna> i got used to installing packages and modules a certain way
[12:49] <Lethliel> when i try with Synaptic not all is installed
[12:49] <godmachine81> its mostly just something you would look at and "think" your system is optimized.. when its really no different
[12:50] <godmachine81> running 386 compiled apps on a 686 compiled kernel really serves no purpose at all
[12:50] <gnudna> as for TGPO 's comment i made a mistake i meant the arch specific kernels
[12:50] <fabiim> how to i get back to firefox 1.5 ?
[12:50] <jrib> Lethliel: 'sudo apt-get install fluxbox'  please pastebin the result of this ocmmand
[12:50] <cntb> godmachine81:  what can best stream fullscreen that link http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/live_tv.html  ?
[12:50] <holycow> !h264
[12:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about h264 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:50] <his_dudnes> preaction :the crapy ones have no ethernet they are very common in greece...
[12:50] <LineOf7s> !HAL
[12:50] <godmachine81> cntb:: just find the actual media location and stream it with mplayer.. just have your proper codecs installed
[12:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about HAL - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:51] <preaction> his_dudnes, good luck then :'(
[12:51] <Lethliel> already tried that.. i have the newest versions of fluxbox and blackbox
[12:51] <his_dudnes> :(
[12:51] <holycow> does anyone know what package installs support for qt h264 encoding? i had it working on dapper once and now i can't remember which one has the support.  w32codecs has qt support but it seems not h264.
[12:51] <gnudna> kalispera his_dudnes
[12:51] <gnudna> ;)
[12:51] <his_dudnes> i end out proposing them vmplayer...
[12:51] <TGPO> Lethliel, what is it doing when you select to boot into FB?

[12:52] <sobersabre> which version of QT is build kde of edgy eft ?
[12:52] <Lethliel> TGPO: it works... but there are no menu entries.. i used debian and was used, that all menu entries are done for me ;)
[12:52] <gnudna> ivx /etc/init.d/proftpd start
[12:53] <cntb> beautiful godmachine81 that is it
[12:53] <sobersabre> qt3.x or qt4.x ?
[12:53] <searey29> can some one help with setting up my wireless card
[12:53] <his_dudnes> gnuda :i am not frequent here ,is greek considered bad maners?
[12:53] <TGPO> Lethliel, building the menu's is really easy
[12:53] <sobersabre> searey29 someone can indeed.
[12:53] <sobersabre> what card do you own ?
[12:53] <gnudna> i dont think so

[12:53] <searey29> its a broadcom in my hp laptop
[12:53] <his_dudnes> thanks
[12:54] <TGPO> Lethliel, from any editor edit .fluxbox/menu
[12:54] <searey29> I have downloaded ndisgtk
[12:54] <Lethliel> TPGO, i know.. but i am lazy and thought there is a opportunity to let the system import the menu settings from gnome :)
[12:54] <searey29> grabed 2 of the .inf files from the windoz driver
[12:54] <searey29> loaded it into the wrapper
=== driv[class]  is now known as drivera90
=== to0ks is now known as to0ks_aw
[12:54] <cntb> Flannel are you from greece ?
[12:55] <jrib> Lethliel: do you have the 'menu' package installed?
[12:55] <searey29> and I still cant get the card to pull an ip
[12:55] <his_dudnes> gnuda join it if you feel like speaking greek
[12:55] <Lethliel> jrib yes done that
[12:55] <gnudna> his_dudnes, for your issue i think you need add a module to the kernel
[12:55] <Flannel> cntb: nope
[12:55] <gnudna> if i remmebr correctly
[12:55] <barnetod> tgpo i agree :)
[12:55] <barnetod> linux and wireless = retarded
[12:56] <searey29> I was wondering is there more than the 2 inf files I need to load
[12:56] <barnetod> apparently my laptop does not support the installationg of linux network manager
[12:56] <barnetod> how does that work?
[12:56] <searey29> lol at barntod
[12:56] <his_dudnes> gnuda : from then on do i set it up like a normal AT(ppp0) modem from the gui?
[12:56] <searey29> Im onwireless now avaya but it is a borrowed card
[12:56] <barnetod> my network card is built in
[12:56] <barnetod> intel 3945abg
[12:57] <searey29> mine too
[12:57] <TGPO> barnetod, I was refering to people who truly require training wheels to sit infront of a keyboard. Thats twice in 30 minutes I have seen the "I'm lazy" explanations
[12:57] <gnudna> his_dudnes, i have the same issue as yourself i dont own 1 so i never tried
[12:57] <gnudna> what is the make and model?
[12:57] <gnudna> im sure google has some info
[12:57] <barnetod> gnuda
[12:57] <barnetod> gnudna i have tried 40 different ways
[12:57] <barnetod> nadda
[12:57] <Lethliel> but i always thought there should be a .blackbox dir too for blackbox and some style theme for fluxbox
[12:57] <gnudna> if its a common modem in greece then almost positive someone has a fix
[12:57] <his_dudnes> a very crapy greek one , the generic driver cxacru seems to work...
[12:58] <Lethliel> style-dir sorry
[12:58] <barnetod> gnudna others have gotten it
[12:58] <barnetod> but mine just will not support it
[12:58] <Arrick> hey how do I make ubuntu breezy listen onport 8080?
[12:58] <searey29> Broadcom 4306
[12:58] <Arrick> been a long while\
[12:58] <gnudna> maybe a different version or chipset
[12:58] <barnetod> yeah no telling
[12:58] <TGPO> barnetod, 'lspci' returns it as intel chipset or bcm chipset?
[12:59] <morgue> does anyone have an idea of how to install the rio 500 on ubuntu?
[12:59] <his_dudnes> but from the telephone i didnt manage to go throu, the guides proposed compiling a new kernel but they where refering to 5.10
[12:59] <barnetod> tgpo hold on
[12:59] <barnetod> im in xp right now :)
[12:59] <ivx> gnudna are you good with proftp

[12:59] <ivx> d
[12:59] <raindog> Question about Firestarter:  In the active connections window it doesn't always remove connections that are no longer open.  Is this a bug, or is there a way to fix this
[12:59] <barnetod> not even bothering with trying to get broadcom 44xx to work yet
[01:00] <gnudna> ivx its been a while
[01:00] <gnudna> but maybei can help
[01:00] <searey29> really why
[01:00] <ivx> gnudna well what ftp software do you use
[01:00] <searey29> you just going hard wired
[01:00] <Lethliel> so what was the name of the blackbox file where the resolution and background image is set?
[01:00] <gnudna> ivx i use vsftpd
[01:00] <TGPO> barnetod, its not to hard anymore, use the fwcutter install instructions instead of ndiscrapper
[01:00] <MattJ> Is XDMCP secure?
[01:01] <searey29> fwcutter
[01:01] <searey29> ?
[01:01] <Flannel> Lethliel: you might try asking in #blackbox
[01:01] <TGPO> http://fwcutter.berlios.de
[01:01] <MugginsM> mattj: define "secure"
[01:01] <barnetod> where are those tgpo?
[01:01] <barnetod> okay
[01:01] <Lethliel> thats right... sorry didnt know that there is such a channel
[01:01] <MugginsM> xdmcp  still runs unencrypted doesn't it? so password go plaintext
[01:01] <TGPO> fwcutter is in universe so
[01:01] <holycow> correct
[01:01] <searey29> does it work the same way
[01:01] <MattJ> MugginsM: Safe to be accessible by the internet
[01:02] <holycow> you need to run xdmcp over ssh
[01:02] <LeeJunFan> is it possible to use vlc to encode mp3 streams with ubuntu packages or do I have to compile my own libs and vlc?
[01:02] <TGPO> barnetod, apt-get install fwcutter
[01:02] <jaime> hi
[01:02] <jaime> everybody
[01:02] <ivx> gnudna well that might do, i need to setup the config file so that i have 2 users, each going to a different folder, with a password, do you have a config file for vsftpd that will do that
[01:02] <barnetod> what about the intel card
[01:02] <warty> hi
[01:02] <Flannel> MattJ: XDMCP uses UDP, so you can't really do it from the internet
[01:02] <barnetod> ?
[01:02] <MattJ> Ah, didn't know
[01:02] <TGPO> barn did you get the chipset is was returning from lspci?
[01:02] <searey29> I will look at that
[01:02] <gnudna> ivx vsftpd automatically chroots user's to their home directories
[01:03] <gnudna> be default
[01:03] <searey29> I saw in a post someone used it for bsd on mac
[01:03] <ivx> gnudna basically i need to have ftp for my websites that are apahaced hosted
[01:03] <gnudna> so it might be what you need
[01:03] <Flannel> MattJ: you could tunnel it through something like ssh, which would also make it secure
[01:03] <holycow> not only that vsftd is extremely fast in comparison to proftpd
[01:03] <holycow> makes proftpd looks like a slug
[01:03] <TGPO> barnetod,  did you get the chipset is was returning from lspci?
[01:03] <MattJ> SSH tunneling is hard to set up :)
[01:03] <holycow> not really
[01:03] <MattJ> Especially when I'm using WIndows
[01:03] <holycow> however someone has already done it for you
[01:03] <MugginsM> you can't do XDMCP broadcast through ssh though I think
[01:03] <phewl> hey im installin steam but no fonts show up and i cant type in the login box, anyone know what the problem is?
[01:03] <barnetod> no im trying to find info lol
[01:03] <holycow> MattJ, www.nomachine.com
[01:04] <barnetod> im so burnt out from trying to get it lol
[01:04] <barnetod> im lost :)
[01:04] <LoRdToLsToI> i need help mi pc is in a veri bad position ([DR-DOS]  A:\] 
[01:04] <ivx> gnudna well how do i creat users with passowrds, do you know where i can get a conf file that will do that
[01:04] <TGPO> barnetod, then you may be trying to set up a bcm anyway
=== mamo_bdn is now known as nene24_bdn
[01:04] <MattJ> I don't need to broadcast, just connect to my desktop
[01:04] <holycow> MattJ, there is also a freenx dealie but i don't know the status of that app
[01:04] <Keigo-kun> When trying to run Frostwire I get the following error, please help. "runFrost.sh: 44: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "}")"
[01:04] <warty> i em stupido blanco
[01:04] <gnudna> ivx vsftpd allows you to use passwd
[01:04] <GerManson> warty?
[01:04] <gnudna> so create a user there
[01:04] <barnetod> tgpo know of any good read throughs?
[01:04] <gnudna> just make sure shell is nologin
[01:04] <barnetod> i may just need to get the broadcom working so i can atleast use the net
[01:05] <ivx> gnudna well where are the passwords and user groups stored
[01:05] <barnetod> and work as i read rather than dual booting to use wireless
[01:05] <TGPO> barnetod, throughs?
[01:05] <MattJ> I guess there's always VNC if I have problems
[01:05] <LoRdToLsToI> HELLO
[01:05] <barnetod> sorry lol
[01:05] <barnetod> read thru
[01:05] <barnetod> :)
[01:05] <MattJ> It's just slower
[01:05] <barnetod> guides
[01:05] <holycow> when installing vsftpd btw, it won't actually work out of the box for security reasons you need to enable whatever featues you need from /etc/vsftpd.conf or whatever
[01:05] <gnudna> ivx have you checked out the vsftpd doc's im only asking cause in 2 seconds i have to google it
[01:06] <gnudna> brb
[01:06] <TGPO> barnetod, the best one is on http://fwcutter.berlios.de  however I have seen a couple via google that were OK too
[01:06] <GerManson> i got some packages that appears on update-manager, but i cannot select em to upgrade..
[01:06] <ivx> gnudna i looked at there supplied config files but i can't figure it out
[01:06] <Flannel> MattJ: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=167820 and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ThinClientHowto

[01:11] <cpk1> !work
[01:11] <ubotu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[01:11] <Flannel> bah.  Anyway, mirak, doens't work doesn't mean anything, we need more information, like an error message
[01:11] <Keigo-kun> Okey this is going to sound retarded... I just installed Frostwire from a .deb package, and I want to uninstall it.. how?
[01:11] <Flannel> Keigo-kun: start up your favorite package manager, and uninstall it
[01:11] <preaction> Keigo-kun, apt-get remove frostwire should work
[01:11] <LoRdToLsToI> Flannel tel me pls

[01:12] <Keigo-kun> Hmm, even if frostwire isn't part of apt-get? (which it might be, just speaking hypotheticaly)
[01:12] <LoRdToLsToI> next ?
[01:12] <Flannel> LoRdToLsToI: tell you what?  All you've said is the install doesn't work.  What goes wrong?
[01:12] <mirak> Flannel: just do the command and give the package list, that will help me

[01:20] <MattHARDY> so many peoples

[01:23] <lukeb> how do i print out the contents of all my files in /var/log recursively?
[01:23] <manudeb> direct rendering: Yes
[01:23] <GerManson> Do i need more specs to run true combat elite, concept10  ?
[01:23] <manudeb> this is fine
[01:23] <manudeb> only why 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b ??
[01:23] <eegore> I am now trying to build a CS server for an internet cafe

[01:24] <kida> you mean actually "print"?
[01:24] <lukeb> print to screen

[01:25] <lukeb> kida, thanks, but that command doesn't actually 'cat' out each file if u know what i mean
[01:25] <kida> ohh
[01:25] <kida> luke: i thought you just meant file names
[01:25] <andreasdk> How does one install typo3?
[01:25] <cpk1> mirak: well once you find the missing deps then you should be good to go installing mythtv
[01:25] <concept10> GerManson, no

[01:28] <kida> luke:  something along the lines of this:
[01:28] <^sukebe> thanks ubotu!
[01:28] <concept10> GerManson, Though TC:E is based on the ET engine, it has higher minimum system requirements:
[01:28] <concept10> You'll need at least an 800mhz processor, 320mb of RAM, a 64mb video card and 750mb of free space as Enemy Territory weights 250mb and TCE 0.49 around 450mb. Recommended system specs are a 128mb video card and at least 512mb of RAM.

[01:31] <phewl> im installin steam but no fonts show up and i cant type in the login box, anyone know what the problem is?
[01:31] <dxdt> LineOf7s, I used to get those... then they just stopped.  I never figured out what difference they made.....  nothing ever seemed broken.
[01:31] <dxdt> weird

[01:31] <dxdt> lupine_85, lol
[01:31] <lupine_85> seriously. I just did
[01:31] <LineOf7s> dxdt:  That's the other apparent solution - they just go away.  Cool, but not exactly helpful.  :oD
[01:32] <dxdt> lupine_85, you could hit up #ubuntu+1  (but you probably already know about that place if you have upgraded )

[01:32] <kalikiana> cobelloy: maybe via xmms?
[01:32] <lupine_85> it's in a debootstrap anyway right now
[01:33] <cobelloy> mencoder or xmms - OK
[01:33] <WindDragon> anyone what i miss, y i dont have an audio output?
[01:33] <his_dudnes> cobelloy : i dont know if it does this particular conversion but it does most of the multimedia conversions possible
[01:33] <cobelloy> can amarok do a batch conversion?
[01:33] <lupine_85> hehe, even man isn't installed right now...
[01:33] <lupine_85> cobelloy: dont' think so
[01:33] <dxdt> lupine_85, hahaha that's awesome
[01:34] <lupine_85> there's be some random cli utility that does it
[01:34] <his_dudnes> cobelloy batch and gui are not ment to be together in my opinion...
[01:34] <cobelloy> no, but thats OK, simple command line is within my power
[01:35] <lupine_85> apt-cache search is your friend :)
[01:35] <dxdt> lupine_85, I plan on messing around with it once I get a desktop setup.  Right now I run Edgy on my laptop and that's my only machine so I can't risk breakage on it.
[01:35] <kalikiana> his_dudnes: there *are* few gui batch tools, like xmms with disk writer plugin :)
[01:36] <cobelloy> xmms disk writer plugin - will look it up
[01:36] <thybo> i have issue with qemu installation
[01:37] <his_dudnes> kalikiana: its an opininion ,if you dont go command line for batch jobs, them probably there is no reason to go command line at all...
[01:37] <kalikiana> cobelloy: i'm not 100% sure about the name, but it can do that

[01:39] <mekanzoo> hello
[01:39] <cntb> edgy kde konqueror and firefox both dont play youtube with sound. youtube silent on both
[01:39] <his_dudnes> kalikiana : i know you are right, its just that i find the command line the "elegant" way to do things...
[01:39] <lupine_85> ho hum, ubuntu-standard is b0rken in feisty. never mind
[01:40] <lupine_85> what I was wondering is whether I could use a 64-bit kernel with a 32-bit system
[01:40] <lupine_85> (e.g. 32bit libc, apps, etc)
[01:40] <kalikiana> cntb: i recommend using flash9 beta
[01:40] <kitche> lupine_85: yes but you will have a multi-lib system
[01:40] <lupine_85> would I need to install 64 bit libs for the kernel?!
[01:41] <kitche> lupine_85: you need 64 bit libs for everything
[01:41] <kitche> lupine_85: but I know people that run 64-bit and 32bit at the same time so it can be done
[01:41] <cntb> kalikiana:  you can play clips from yooutube on firefox and konqueror ?
[01:42] <lupine_85> hmm. I'm basically wanting it for chroots - i've got several 64 bit ones I'd love to be able to jump in and out of, but the main one I want to be 32 bit
[01:42] <kalikiana> his_dudnes: as long as it is easier than gui, yes; i would laugh at anybody trying to terminate a process using a gui taskmanager when he knows the binary's name :D
[01:42] <cntb> Imean kalikiana sound included
[01:42] <kalikiana> cntb: yeah, since i use flash9 it's working
[01:43] <kalikiana> cntb: before it always crahsed or just worked muted
[01:43] <cntb> worked muted exactly
[01:43] <cntb> so kalikiana shortest way to get flash would be .. ?

[01:55] <dbzdeath> hi i'm having a really weird problem i'm on ubuntu edgy and i'm trying to mount my fat32 partition but when i try to do so mount tells me "mount: /dev/disk/by-uuid/4205-56D5 already mounted or /mnt/windows busy" but if i type mount and look at the mounted partitions it isn't there could someone please help me?
[01:55] <gnomefreak> kikokos: not much you can do with it
[01:55] <kikokos> gnome freak what`s u mean what is wrong?
[01:55] <Fry3001> i have a problem with fglrx with an ati x600. It keeps telling me that "DRI initialization failed!" because of a missing or bad kernel module. But fglrx.ko is present?!
[01:55] <Xtreme> his_dudnes, that wouldnt help as the menu is located in .config/menu found the answer now :)
[01:56] <ixian_> when i associate 'm3u' (playlist) files to play in XMMS, it throws up a warning every time i double click an m3u file: "playlist.m3u" is an executable file" and i have to click 'display' button to load the playlist. how do i stop that warning from appearing and just make it automatically load in XMMS?
[01:56] <kikokos> gnome freak about what is this message?
[01:56] <gnomefreak> kikokos: can you explain what you are doing instead of just throwing out lines?
[01:56] <his_dudnes> if you cant be right at least be inspiring :)
[01:56] <chadswill> heyas.. i have installed both vmware-player and server..now it seems that installs are broken..and i want to remove the player.. sudo apt-get remove vmware-player only gives errors..E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)... and if trying to install new stuff i get: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[01:56] <cisco> cuantas preguntas
[01:56] <Flannel> ixian_: try taking away it's execute bit
[01:56] <Xtreme> his_dudnes, :D
[01:56] <gnomefreak> chadswill: did you run sudo dpkg --configure -a?
[01:57] <Fry3001> chadswill, what is the excact error. iirc you can't install both
[01:57] <ixian_> Flannel, how would i do that?
[01:57] <chadswill> yes..but it allways fails
[01:57] <sizzam> in Xchat, how do i get the list of channel users on the right -->?
[01:57] <kikokos> gnoem freak yes I tried watch film it apperance everytime when I try do this
[01:57] <Flannel> ixian_: right click it, properties,  go to permissions, then uncheck the execute
[01:57] <cisco> What is the best client for IRC in X? XChat?
[01:57] <Flannel> sizzam: get xchat (in universe) instead of xchat-gnome (in main)
[01:57] <Flannel> !best
[01:57] <ubotu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[01:57] <gnomefreak> kikokos: what type of file is the film?
[01:58] <sizzam> thanks Flannel
[01:58] <kikokos> freak moment I show u
[01:58] <Fry3001> chadswill, there should be an error message above the dpkg error code
[01:58] <kalikiana> cicsco: XChat is my recommendation :)
[01:58] <ixian_> Flannel, i cant change those, it says i need to be root
[01:58] <gnomefreak> Flannel: xchat and xchat-gnome have pretty much same UI now
[01:58] <Flannel> ixian_: er, why does root own your playlist?
[01:58] <cisco> kalikiana thank you!
[01:58] <kikokos> every it`s also DVD also avi, moment I paste it
[01:58] <Flannel> gnomefreak: oh? alright.  I'll remember that.

[01:59] <gnomefreak> siimo: no
[01:59] <gnomefreak> siimo: ff 2.0 is
[01:59] <kikokos> freak
[01:59] <kikokos> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30117/
[01:59] <Fry3001> chadswill, the vmware-player init script could not be started. It is started due to complete vmware-config.pl
[01:59] <siimo> gnomefreak: thats what i mean
[01:59] <gnomefreak> siimo: yes ff rc2
[01:59] <kikokos> I played vlc and open .avi file
[01:59] <kikokos> of course I didnt see a video
[02:00] <gnomefreak> kikokos: im not sure about vlc ive never used it
[02:00] <Fry3001> chadswill, workaround (not nice, but it works..) : remove the /etc/init.d/vmware-player script and set a link named /etc/init.d/vmware-player to /bin/true
[02:00] <Frogduster> ..so..
[02:00] <kronoman> hello people, i'm building a amd sempron for ubuntu, do I need to put that white grease between the cpu and the fan ? thanks!
[02:00] <ixian_> Flannel, i dont know?
[02:00] <Fry3001> chadswill, then remove vmware-player, and after that remove the link
[02:00] <chadswill>  NAT service on /dev/vmnet8           Failed  /   Bridged networking on /dev/vmnet0                                  failed
[02:00] <kikokos> gnome freak ok I can try use another program what u want?
[02:00] <gnomefreak> kronoman: ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:00] <chadswill> ok..ill try
[02:00] <cntb> kalikiana: still here
[02:00] <ixian_> this is my 2nd time installing ubuntu, i cant remember how i fixed the m3u thing before
[02:00] <ixian_> argh..
[02:01] <cntb> ty very much
[02:01] <Frogduster> kronoman, that's a hardware question, and I disclaim all liability.  Yes, you do.
[02:01] <Frogduster> Hehe.
[02:01] <Fry3001> chadswill, of course only if you want to use the server after that :) But there must be a vmware-like solution elsewhere
[02:01] <gnomefreak> kikokos: im not sure how well avi files play but you can try mplayer or something
[02:01] <kalikiana> cntb: yes, what's up?
[02:01] <Flannel> ixian_: Where is the m3u file?
[02:01] <chadswill> yes only gonna use server after
[02:01] <his_dudnes> chadswill :vmplayer worked for me by geting the rpm from the site,converting to a deb with alien,installing the db file and then running vmware-config.pl
[02:01] <ixian_> Flannel, on a FAT32 drive
[02:01] <cntb> ty for update to flashplugin9  solving muted youtube play
[02:01] <snooplsm> whats a program that will update my clock , (atomic time)
[02:01] <ixian_> Flannel, so i dont have my permissions set up properly?
[02:02] <Frogduster> kronoman, it came with your cpu/fan, and requests that you do so, yes?  ..if so, it's what transfers heat from the cpu to the heatsink.
[02:02] <kalikiana> cntb: good to hear, so i'll keep on recommending it :)
[02:02] <Fry3001> his_dudnes, there should be a way using the version shipped with ubuntu
[02:02] <kronoman> Frogduster: no, my cpu didn't came with that paste
[02:02] <kronoman> I have some that is 4 years old
[02:02] <kikokos> gnome freak how to open a file in xine in terminal ?
[02:02] <cntb> you do that also write somewhere so google search will reach it
[02:02] <gnomefreak> kronoman: and Frogduster move it to #ubuntu-offtopic please
[02:02] <Frogduster> gnomefreak, *nod*
[02:02] <chadswill> Fry3001:  and set a link named /etc/init.d/vmware-player to /bin/true   explain a little..heh
[02:02] <Flannel> ixian_: ah, you've got a umask set up wrong, in your fstab, or whereever it happens to be
[02:02] <kronoman> gnomefreak: done, thanks
[02:02] <ixian_> whgat should the umask be?
[02:03] <Fry3001> chadswill, easy... the start action will always pass, so the configure job runs, and vmware player will be removed
[02:03] <Fry3001> chadswill, you have to unload the kernel modules manually (i.e. reboot)
[02:03] <Flannel> ixian_: FAT32 has no permissions, so the permissions are being set by whatever mounted it.  umask should be 0111, read/write for everyone (unless you want to restrict writing, etc)
[02:03] <ixian_> Flannel, /dev/hdb1       /media/Stuff  vfat    iocharset=utf8,umask=000   0       0   <--- thats the line
[02:03] <Flannel> ixian_: 111
[02:04] <Flannel> ixian_: umask is opposite of the perms you'll want.  so if you want 666, 111 is your mask (111 ^ 666 = 777)
[02:04] <chadswill> ok..but i dont understand how/where to set link
[02:04] <Fry3001> chadswill, /bin/true is a file that always results in a success, so the dpkg -configure works. After that, the link in /etc/init.d could be removed
[02:04] <mirak> ead: Build-dependencies for libqt3-mt-dev could not be satisfied.
[02:04] <Fry3001> chadswill, as i said, just a workaround, but it works. i use the player at several stations, and it couses errors sometimes
[02:04] <ixian_> is there a way i can remount my partitions wiithout rebooting?
[02:05] <Fry3001> btw anyone knows if the fglrx doesn't support x600 anymore??
[02:05] <his_dudnes> ixian_ i think you whant "mount -a"
[02:07] <cryptonic> could someone help me install wengophone 2.0 binary
[02:07] <cryptonic> ?
[02:07] <Alethes> http://freshmeat.net/projects/gtktrue/ is a nice frontend for /bin/true }:D
=== BoggsBeer is now known as Deaigo
[02:08] <kikokos> gnome freak could u look at this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30119/
[02:08] <kikokos> ?
[02:08] <kikokos> in 23 line I tried play file
[02:08] <Fry3001> Alethes, lol... there should be a frontend for /bin/false as well
[02:09] <Alethes> heh
[02:09] <Alethes> it's called explorer.exe
[02:09] <Fry3001> rofl
[02:09] <Alethes> ;)
[02:09] <jvai> lol..i'm late
[02:09] <x873514> Hey, could someone help me with some Active Directory troubles?
[02:09] <kikokos> gnome freak what u think about this?
[02:10] <Fry3001> well that one has a creepy gui too. gtktrue seems more useful ^^
[02:10] <Alethes> hehe
[02:10] <Alethes> the link to the app is dead :/
[02:10] <cntb> how to install wine
[02:10] <sidewalk`> i just installed nvidia betadriver
[02:10] <Alethes> he used to have a sceenshot and everything
[02:10] <sidewalk`> how do i "roll back" to the old one?
[02:10] <Fry3001> saw it. i really wanted to look at the code
[02:10] <jerp> so edgy is the big dog on the block now...
[02:10] <kalikiana> cntb: try synaptic ;)
[02:10] <jerp> "stable"
[02:11] <chadswill> Fry3001 how and where do i set a link to /bin/true ?  im kinda new to this..heh
[02:11] <cntb> or konsole apt-get install kalikiana ?
[02:12] <kalikiana> cntb: just as you like :)
[02:12] <x873514> Can anybody help me? I'm trying to add an ubuntu server to Active Directory and it's having a bit of a problem.

[02:12] <jcaceres> hello does anybody knows a irc chanel for ubuntu of 64 bits
[02:12] <jcaceres> ?
[02:12] <GaiaX11> I have ubuntu and kde in my machine and I want to upgrade dapper to edgy from a ubuntu alternate cd. if i do it, does this mean that I will upgrade only ubuntu desktop? How about my kubuntu?

[02:12] <kikokos> ?
[02:12] <cntb> wine is on universe repos  kalikiana
[02:12] <KeithWeisshar> I did a new text mode install from a ubuntu 6.10 dvd but when i boot i am unable to boot and eventually i get kicked out into busybox
[02:13] <chadswill> do i deleted all in the vmware file and write /bin/true? or what?
[02:13] <cntb> ty kalikiana
[02:13] <kalikiana> cntb: no problem :)
[02:13] <KeithWeisshar> why am i unable to boot ubuntu after installing from dvd
[02:13] <Fry3001> chadswill, you just make a symbolic link to /bin/true
[02:13] <KeithWeisshar> it's a dvd i ordered from frozentech.com
[02:13] <chadswill> ln: creating symbolic link `/etc/init.d/vmware-player' to `/bin/true': File exists
[02:13] <Fry3001> chadswill, that results in the success of the init script (which is your problem)
[02:13] <Fry3001> chadswill, you have to remove/move the script first
[02:14] <KeithWeisshar> is there a reason why ubuntu 6.10 dvd won't boot in my gateway
[02:14] <Fry3001> chadswill, mv /etc/init.d/vmware-player /etc/init.d/vmware-player.bak
[02:14] <GaiaX11> I have ubuntu and kde in my machine and I want to upgrade dapper to edgy from a ubuntu alternate cd. if i do it, does this mean that I will upgrade only ubuntu desktop? How about my kubuntu?
[02:15] <KeithWeisshar> i get the ubunto splash screen and only a tiny portion of the progress bar is filled from the leftmost side
[02:15] <x873514> Anybody know anything about Ubuntu and Active Directory?
[02:15] <chadswill> ok..removed
[02:15] <skelter> hey - i'm having the issue w/ eclipse and edgy 64bit, found this page (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/eclipse/+bug/68380/+viewstatus) that gives a .debdiff file. could anyone tell me how to use it?
[02:15] <shini`> ahoy~ can anyone help me set up opengl for development so I can begin programming opengl on my ubuntu ? x_x
[02:15] <cryptonic> how do you install a .sh file?
[02:16] <KeithWeisshar> after three minutes i get kicked out into the busy box console
[02:16] <skelter> or if i'm barking up the wrong tree, letting me know would be nice O:-)
[02:16] <kalikiana> GaiaX11: it should update anything - but it might need a internet connection
[02:16] <skelter> cryptonic: chmod +x whatever.sh; ./whatever.sh
[02:16] <Abnerian> Hey, I have a question
[02:16] <Frogduster> cryptonic, the "./whatever.sh" part of that actually runs the script.
[02:16] <welly> hey all.. i'm getting this error user is not in the sudoers file.
[02:16] <Abnerian> Is there any way to install Ubuntu from a USB stick?
[02:16] <welly> how do i add my user to the sudoers file?
[02:16] <Abnerian> From stick to drive.
[02:17] <skelter> welly: /etc/sudoers has a list
[02:17] <Frogduster> cryptonic, the "chmod +x whatever.sh" part of that makes it executable, and only needs to be done once.
[02:17] <KeithWeisshar> i need help with ubuntu 6.10 dvd
[02:17] <cntb> no special channel for wine -- #wine
[02:17] <welly> skelter: ok cheers
[02:17] <KeithWeisshar> i ordered the dvd from frozentech for 2.48
[02:17] <kalikiana> Abnerian: given ur drive is big enough and your pc boots it, then probably yes :)
[02:17] <Abnerian> >_> Is it possible to install Ubuntu to a drive from a USB stick?
[02:17] <cntb> KeithWeisshar: is it a good price ;-)
[02:17] <KeithWeisshar> i did a text install and it completed but am unable to boot
[02:18] <Abnerian> My drive is two gigs
[02:18] <shwag> how do I create a new wiki page? when I try and edit a page not found, it says Im trying to edit the UserDocumentation page, and im not.
[02:18] <Abnerian> And I don't want to run from the stick
[02:18] <Abnerian> I want to run from the drive
[02:18] <cntb> Keithw grubinstall from rescue
[02:18] <GaiaX11> kalikiana: But do you think that upgrading from an ubuntu6.10 cd will speed things up. Instead of only using the internet connexion?
[02:18] <KeithWeisshar> ubuntu hangs at the splash screen
[02:18] <jerp> I think it should be if you can get the system to boot from the USB stick
[02:19] <KeithWeisshar> i get the ubuntu splash screen and the progress bar won't move
[02:19] <skelter> could anyone tell me how to use a .debdiff file? trying to patch eclipse for edgy 64bit
[02:19] <Abnerian> >_> Dammit. I need to install...Huh. Actually, do any Ubuntu LiveCDs run from USB?
[02:19] <KeithWeisshar> after 3 minutes i get kicked into busy box console
[02:19] <cntb> KeithWeisshar: ask some pro here to tune resolution between graphic card and monitor
[02:19] <kalikiana> GaiaX11: it should :)
[02:20] <Abnerian> How would I install a LiveCD image on a USB key?
[02:20] <florides> Hello
[02:20] <killown> where I save commands in the scripts init.d?
[02:20] <cntb> kalikiana: do you know howto troubleshoot new ubuntu install stuck on splash screen ? resolution maybe restart x maybe ?

[02:22] <kev_b> anyone here using/know about pam_encfs?

[02:22] <cryptonic> so how do i know if it installed?
[02:22] <GaiaX11> kalikiana: Do you think that i need to change the source.list from dapper to edgy when upgrading from a cd or the cd itself will change the source.list for me
[02:22] <skelter> it didn't
[02:22] <skelter> but that was only step 1
[02:22] <skelter> you forgot step 2

[02:24] <KeithWeisshar> edgy not booting, stuck on splash screen
[02:24] <KeithWeisshar> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[02:24] <KeithWeisshar> I just did a fresh install of edgy onto my computer. The installation went smoothly with no problems. However, after the installation I am unable to boot into edgy. I get stuck on the Ubuntu splash screen and can't go any further.
[02:24] <skelter> cryptonic: the "." in ./whatever.sh refers to the current directory. the "/home/blahblah" means you don't need to put the "."
[02:25] <kev__> Anyone using/know about pam_encfs?
[02:25] <jerp> on a usbstick?? try this....... sudo mkfs.ext3 -b 4096 -L <present label> /dev/sda1

[02:25] <chotchki> hey does anyone have any experience with propel (php database lib) on edgy? i am having problems making it and php5-xsl work
[02:25] <florides>  My ubuntu edgy eft doesn't start and it said"hub 1-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 1.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?"
[02:25] <florides> but ther is no cable on port 1
[02:25] <KeithWeisshar> i installed using text mode install
[02:25] <Fry3001> this fglrx driver knockes me out :(
[02:27] <cryptonic> hmmmmm.......crap it just broke, think it was because i didnt uninstall the previous version first now the add/remove programs is bust
[02:27] <kev_b> pam_encfs doesn't mount my /home/user directory when i login and I can't figure out why :S Anyone know about it?
[02:27] <chotchki> mainly in the fact that install php5-xsl doesnt seem to make it work

[02:35] <cryptonic> mzli : how do i fix the problem
[02:35] <skelter> tealc: go to the "places" menu at the top of the screen

[02:37] <Toma-> cntb: there is, but it was from before editing my partitions...
[02:37] <profoX`> goingtomoonbrb: my experience is that out of the box hardware compatibility is better than most distro's, but slightly worse than OpenSUSE's
[02:37] <Fry3001> highneko, should be accesible at port 80... but that doesn't lead us to the problem
[02:37] <phargle> heh
[02:37] <phargle> Animule: type "man apt-get"
[02:37] <phargle> or something
[02:38] <kev_b> goingtomoonbrb: Well, in the strictest sense it isn't the best. You need to add the 'restricted' respository to get a lot of the wifi drivers, I believe once that's done it's similar to most distros.

[02:42] <LjL> Kjoo: typing "klear ubuntu" gave a valid result as the second hit on google for me. it's a dapper package though.
[02:42] <mranostay> does ubuntu do some weird patches to the .htaccess feature?
[02:43] <LjL> cntb: yeah except you need to escape spaces in filenames, in unix
[02:43] <kev_b> mranostay: What do you mean?
[02:43] <LjL> cntb: so wine /media/sda1/Program Files/Internet\ Explorer/iexplore.exe     or      wine "/media/sda1/Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe"
[02:43] <cntb> OK
[02:43] <LjL> well Program Files has to be escaped as well of course

[02:44] <kev_b> mranostay: .htaccess files are a standard format for apache
[02:45] <cntb> LjL: I see so what standard programs will work on wine LjL ?
[02:46] <ixian_> how do i set the 'owner' of a fat32 partition to myself? it is set on root..
[02:46] <LjL> cntb, IE probably works, just not that way. what standard programs works in Windows, if you just run the executable from an external hard drive, without having them installed first?
[02:46] <LjL> almost none.
[02:46] <vladuz976> if i can't umount a device because it's busy. how can i check what's using it?
[02:46] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell ixian_ about windowsdrives
[02:46] <LjL> vladuz976: lsof
[02:46] <mzli> <ixian_>no need.
[02:47] <vladuz976> LjL: returns nothing
[02:47] <cntb> like regedit.exe LjL ?
[02:47] <ixian_> well im trying to make my 'm3u' files NOT executable... but i cant change that option because i am not root
[02:47] <LjL> cntb: that will work, but then the regedit.exe that comes with Wine is a specific Wine version
[02:47] <ixian_> they are all on my fat32 drive

[02:48] <coastermaster> what's a good linux program for writing code (with syntax highlighting)?  I do mostly C and Java
[02:48] <sidewalk`> how do i get my  working in ubuntu?
[02:48] <dxdt> coastermaster, vim
[02:48] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell sidewalk` about locale
[02:48] <dxdt> once you get used to it, it rules so hard
[02:48] <mzli> <coastermaster>emacs
[02:48] <tom__> ixian_ could u set them up to open with your media player?
[02:49] <coastermaster> not a fan of vim and I've never used emacs so I'll have to try it
[02:49] <ixian_> tom__ if i set them to open with xmms, it always warns me im trying to open an executable file
[02:49] <dxdt> dxdt, as far as IDE's go, I know of Anjuata (or a spelling close to that) for a c++ ide.  Java you could use sun's or use Eclipse or something.
[02:49] <tom__> ah i see
[02:49] <mzli> <coastermaster> emacs is excellent. vim is also good. both are perfect.
[02:49] <compilerwriter> Has anyone managed to get edgy eft to work with their palm?
[02:50] <coastermaster> i'm installing emacs right now
[02:50] <ixian_> mzli, if i make another playlist file sometime in the future would i need to run that command again?
[02:50] <tom__> anyone using lomoco with a logitech g5?
[02:50] <mzli> vim is default installed.
[02:50] <cntb> better install XEN VM then ? LjL ? much more useful than wine right?
[02:50] <dxdt> cause the new version  of Vim supports code completion, highlighting, tabs, etc off the bat.  Which is awesome.
[02:50] <Err_> is this where i go for questions? i am a total newb from windows xp
[02:50] <LjL> cntb, i'm not sure why you're reaching that conclusion actually.
[02:50] <jvai> i thought ubuntu had emacs by default?? thwe manpages can be accessed thru the terminal
[02:50] <mzli> <Err_>read some introduction.
[02:50] <sidewalk`> tnx
[02:51] <smoenux> Err_ ... yup, but there are some great forums on the ubuntu website
[02:51] <dxdt> Err_, yep, and http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy is also very helpful to new people.  (Or at least it was for me)
[02:51] <Err_> i've read a lot and i'm not getting anywhere with it...
[02:51] <LjL> cntb: i just said that, to use programs on Wine, you have to *install* them. same goes for Windows, and for Windows on Xen, and for Windows on VMWare, and for Windows on QEmu...
[02:51] <mzli> <Err_>no shortcut to use linux.
[02:51] <dxdt> that site has kinda just step by step instructions for common things all in a row
[02:51] <LjL> cntb: sure, Wine will run fewer programs than Xen or QEmu. that's true, but it doesn't mean you should ditch it - depends on what you need
[02:51] <cntb> i am aiming at installing for common users some of them dummy who will stiil need to use their windows skills
[02:51] <cntb> LjL:
[02:52] <madewokherd> is this the correct support channel for edgy?
[02:52] <mzli> <Err_>command line instruction is the most basic step, and the most important step.
[02:52] <cntb> yep madewokherd
[02:52] <smoenux> Err_ when windows 95 was first released, no-one knew where to start, or what to do... same with Linux for those moving accross from another platform
[02:52] <madewokherd> uh, ok, I'm trying to install edgy
[02:52] <cntb> smoenux: was that for me?
[02:52] <madewokherd> and it keeps telling me "No root file system" even though I have one
[02:52] <LjL> cntb, Wine won't run all Windows programs. that's for sure. but if you use VMware or Xen or something, it'll be like having a "screen in the screen" that runs Windows: you won't just have to install programs, you'll have to install a complete copy of Windows. they're just emulators.
[02:52] <smoenux> cntb ... ?? directed at Err_
[02:52] <madewokherd> http://img224.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotinstall2lj2.png <-- I took a screenshot of it
[02:52] <Err_> what about OS X? A lot of people can get the hang of it quickly. Do you feel ubuntu is better than os x?
[02:53] <tom__> Err_ I have only been using it a week or so. Stick with it it doesnt take too long to get to grips.
[02:53] <morphish> madewokherd: is / on a logical partition?
[02:53] <mzli> <smoenux>you are right , forget how to operate computer under win, learn from first step.
[02:53] <madewokherd> yes
[02:53] <madewokherd> it is
[02:53] <LjL> cntb: Wine, instead, lets you run [some]  Windows programs *inside* of your Gnome/KDE/whatever desktop
[02:53] <Err_> why do you think so madewokherd
[02:53] <morphish> madewokherd: use the alternate cd, the gui installer hates them for some reason, did this to me, alternate worked
[02:53] <Err_> oh oops
[02:53] <mzli> <Err_>Mac is masterpiece.but is not open.
[02:53] <madewokherd> alternate cd..?
[02:53] <smoenux> mzli ... ^.^
[02:53] <sidewalk`> nope, still not working
[02:54] <morphish> madewokherd: the text one, gui is "Desktop CD", text is "Alternate CD"
[02:54] <CoolCubix> morphish, shoudn't it be on a primary partition ??

[02:54] <LjL> cntb: for example, Office 2000 and Photoshop 7 should work inside Wine. just examples -- go to their site, they have a database of applications
[02:54] <Toma-> appdb
[02:54] <madewokherd> so I have to download another cd..
[02:54] <morphish> CoolCubix: why? i'm on a logical partition right now and was so before on two other distros, gui installer was first time anything ever hated on it
[02:54] <smoenux> I've used Photoshop on Wine
[02:54] <Err_> i'm trying to install ubuntu onto my windows xp machine, however the hard drive has only 40gb left out of 200gb, I thought that might be enough. But when I went to install it on the live ubuntu CD it goes to the partition portion and FREEZES. So I got GParted to try and create partitions that way, and when GParted scans my HD is FREEZES too!!!
[02:54] <cntb> k will do
[02:54] <morphish> smoenux: the CS or CS2?
[02:54] <cntb> is it wine.org?
[02:55] <ixian_> winehq.org
[02:55] <compilerwriter> ljl could you help me get wine configured to work with palmdesk?
[02:55] <smoenux> it was CS2 ... but it was complaining about the fonts
[02:55] <LjL> compilerwriter: i don't even know what palmdesk is
[02:55] <smoenux> still worked though
[02:55] <morphish> smoenux: i don't need not stinkin fonts ;P all i would use it for is filter images
[02:55] <compilerwriter> It is the winblows version of the palm software.  I can't get my zire21 to connect now that I upgraded to edgy.
[02:55] <smoenux> Lmao
[02:55] <madewokherd> hmm I think I'll just make room on a primary partition
[02:56] <madewokherd> thanks

[02:58] <smoenux> could you guys assist me... I'm trying to rollback my nvidia drivers. I've already uninstalled version 8xxx, and I have downloaded the installer from the nvidia website
[02:58] <LjL> Err_: because the Windows installer overwrites the MBR

[03:05] <markelhas> xp
[03:05] <mzli> <markelhas>Take a look at you cpu fan, maybe the cpu are overheat.
[03:05] <kev_b> klees: Edgy?

[03:05] <klees> kev_b: Edgy
[03:06] <Err_> GaiaX11: what file system should i use for linux, main system? can windows read off of this (not fat32)?
[03:06] <Trainstroker> godmachine81 ?
[03:06] <TBUHP> hello can someone help me if you can please pm me
[03:06] <WindDragon> markelhas: dont use PM to partition it. use the linux partitioner during installtion
[03:06] <mzli> <Err_>default is ext3
[03:06] <klees> Err_: i would recommend ext3 to be ur root / partition
[03:06] <jessie> what do you need TBUHP
[03:06] <kev_b> klees: Apparently this is right, linux-k7 is a dummy package for upgrade, replaced with linux-generic
[03:06] <markelhas> it's ext3
[03:06] <WindDragon> markelhas: when u install linux, delete those partition, and make a new one for linux
[03:07] <TBUHP> I need to know how do you install from the live cd? I got a error no boot partion or something?
[03:07] <klees> kev_b: before it used to give me the option to select it under Dapper
[03:07] <WindDragon> markelhas: but ofcourse, u dun delete the windows partition
[03:07] <jessie> also you can get a driver, NFS or something like that for win
[03:07] <kev_b> klees: What do you see in grub? i386 or generic?
[03:07] <klees> kev_b: generic
[03:07] <klees> 2.6.17-10-generic
[03:08] <TBUHP> ??? anyone
[03:08] <kev_b> klees: basically that is the new name for k7
[03:08] <klees> kev_b: that's the name for the default kernel as well
[03:08] <jessie> TBUHP, what do you need?
[03:08] <TBUHP> ??? anyone
[03:08] <TBUHP> I need to know how do you install from the live cd? I got a error no boot partion or something?
[03:09] <Flannel> TBUHP: When did you get that error?
[03:09] <markelhas0> i'll try it
[03:09] <kev_b> klees: I think it detected your AMD chip, I'm just guessing this based on my install experience
[03:09] <jessie> tbuhp, is your bios set to cd first
[03:09] <markelhas0> but should i try kubuntu or ubuntu?
[03:09] <markelhas0> same thing?
[03:09] <GaiaX11> Err_: make one partition to win (C); ubuntu will suggest you to make a / and a swap partition. Make a swap partition with the double of you RAM and give the rest to /   I would recommend you to use raiserfs for / and install Linux and then Win.
[03:09] <klees> kev_b: np
[03:09] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell markelhas0 about kubuntu
[03:09] <TBUHP> when I wanted to hit finish in and it said reading partions
[03:09] <TBUHP> what are my partions suppose to be?
[03:09] <WindDragon> markelhas: if u like simplicity=ubuntu. windws like = Kubuntu
[03:09] <klees> kev_b: although, is there a way to tell if it's using k7 features?
[03:10] <Err_> GaiaX11: I heard it was a good idea to separate the root partition from the home partition, is that true?
[03:10] <markelhas0> hummm
[03:10] <jessie> markelhas0, do you like gnome or kde. if you don't know or gnome, then go with ubuntu. if you want kde go kubuntu. kde gives you more options
[03:10] <Trainstroker> help : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30124/
[03:10] <Err_> GaiaX11: That way there are 4 partitions, 1 for windows, 1 for /, 1 for swap, and 1 for /home
[03:10] <jessie> GaiaX11, not that i know of
[03:10] <klees> wow Lebron
[03:10] <jessie> you can, but you don't have to
[03:11] <markelhas0> oki i'll try to make a fresh install
[03:11] <klees> can't make a free throw though
[03:11] <markelhas0> i think this i'll not work
[03:11] <TBUHP> well
[03:11] <juanej>  does anyone know ho do i change language and location? i'm getting an error
[03:11] <TBUHP> I am on a mac
[03:11] <kev_b> klaas: apt-cache search linux-image-k7
[03:11] <juanej> it's currently en_CO, i want it to be en_US
[03:11] <kev_b> klaas, not you sorry
[03:11] <kev_b> klees: apt-cache search linux-image-k7
[03:11] <markelhas0> cause when i'm installing i select fo format the partitions
[03:11] <GaiaX11> Err_: Yes. But if you have 70gb for Linux. The system will make a big home for you without the need of making it by hand
[03:11] <WindDragon> TBUHP: u press C when u boot from CD right? for MAC?
[03:12] <jessie> jauanej, where do you want to change the language? in ubuntu or the installer, where?
[03:12] <iamtheric> anyone use lg3d?
[03:12] <juanej> ubuntu
[03:12] <Trainstroker> HELP PLZ : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30124/
[03:12] <TBUHP> yes
[03:12] <kev_b> klees: That command should tell you that it's been obsoleted by generic
[03:12] <juanej> actually xubuntu so if you know the command better
[03:12] <TBUHP> I pressed c
[03:12] <TBUHP> I was running live cd and got in to the desktop
[03:12] <klees> kev_b: it does
[03:12] <markelhas0> WindDragon:  should i remove first the partition in windows via partion magic?
[03:12] <TBUHP> BUt cannot install it
[03:13] <kev_b> klees: other than that i have no idea, sorry : )
[03:13] <WindDragon> markelhas0: i suggest you do. i suspect that the slow down was cause by that
[03:13] <bretzel> How to start using a freshly cerated swap partition ?
[03:13] <klees> kev_b: it's ok thx
[03:13] <bretzel> created *
[03:13] <jessie> jauiaj, then go to system-administation, launguge support.
[03:13] <LjL> bretzel: add it to /etc/fstab, and "swapon -a"
[03:13] <markelhas0> oki them
[03:13] <fontppp> howdy, what command can i run to force a re-install of cups and all related files? I think i broke my cupsd.conf
[03:13] <jessie> gtg
[03:14] <bretzel> oh tnx LjL  :-) it is that simple ! hehehehe
[03:14] <markelhas0> about the mount points, just / and swap?
[03:14] <Err_> GaiaX11: so you recommend installing w/ reiserFS and THEN installing windows?
[03:14] <sidewalk`> how do i get the font called "fixed" working in gnome-terminal?
[03:14] <WindDragon> markelhas0: yes
[03:15] <markelhas0> size for swap 512?
[03:15] <dudesmithy> Hello All..I'm having an installation issue with Edgy..Trying to install to a Dell Dimension 8400 with an Nvidia GeForce 6800 video card and a Dell P991 monitor.  Edgy doesn't seem to be detecting either the video or monitor correctly....I've tried both Regular and safe graphics modes....any ideas on how to proceed?
[03:15] <Flannel> Err_: no, windows gets installed first.  It's easiest to partition everything first, rather than resize later
[03:15] <markelhas0> i've 1024 of ram
[03:15] <WindDragon> markelhas0: swap normally 5-10% of ur linux part
[03:15] <markelhas0> hummm
[03:15] <markelhas0> maybe the problem is there
[03:15] <weezl> aw this chan actuallz exists.. neat
[03:15] <GaiaX11> Err_: first win and then linux with raiserfs for /
[03:15] <LjL> markelhas0: no, make your swap at least as big as your RAM
[03:15] <Flannel> markelhas0, WindDragon, swap is traditionally 2x your RAM, but.. personally I don't see the need for swaps bigger than 1gb
[03:16] <WindDragon> markelhas0: that's good enough for linux
[03:16] <LjL> Flannel: except for hibernation
[03:16] <CarlFK> does installing foo-dev install foo also?
[03:16] <Flannel> LjL: ah, true.
[03:16] <kronoman> hi, little hardware question, a nvidia fx5200 agp will run ok with ubuntu 6.06 ?
[03:16] <TBUHP> ???
[03:16] <LjL> CarlFK: usually yes
[03:16] <markelhas0> i've a partition of 19 gb for /
[03:16] <LjL> kronoman: i'm using one.
[03:16] <LjL> kronoman: you'll need the binary-only drivers for full 3D acceleration
[03:16] <WindDragon> Flannel: but that will cause alot of swapping if u do that. and that is only good for small base RAM PC
[03:16] <kronoman> great, thanks
[03:16] <Err_> Flannel: , GaiaX11: so what do i partition w/, GParted?
[03:16] <CarlFK> LjL: thanks
[03:16] <klees> question
[03:16] <WindDragon> Flannel: doing that with 1024 ram will slow down the machine
[03:17] <Flannel> Err_: whatever you'd like.
[03:17] <mzli> <Flannel> markelhas0, WindDragon, no need to set swap 2 big. 1G is enough, except server.
[03:17] <klees> i have a Radeon 9800 Pro vid card
[03:17] <bretzel> oops fstab: /dev/sda6   ...and what to enter as the mount-point ( none ? ) type=swap ? sorry
[03:17] <juanej> how do i change the screen dpi?
[03:17] <madewokherd> hmm fsck encountered errors resizing my windows partition
[03:17] <markelhas0> oki them i'll use 1gb
[03:17] <klees> on dapper glxgears -printfps would give me more than 6000 fps
[03:17] <Flannel> WindDragon: er, what?  swap space won't ever cause swapping
[03:17] <klees> now i only get ~250
[03:17] <madewokherd> namely that the whole partition mysteriously vanished
[03:17] <madewokherd> wtf
[03:17] <klees> with the fglrx drivers installed
[03:17] <klees> is this ok?
[03:17] <LjL> markelhas0: make it a *little* more than 1gb, to make sure you have space for hibernation if you ever need it
[03:17] <GaiaX11> Err_: With gparted you can partition you whole hd.
[03:17] <dungodung> I need some help. I'm in the shell of the safe mode of an older kernel version. I can't access my newly upgraded ubuntu - the x server doesn't want to start. What am I to do?
[03:18] <madewokherd> "open /dev/hdb1:No such file or directory"
[03:18] <markelhas0> oki them
[03:18] <madewokherd> how did libparted make /dev/hdb1 go away?!
[03:18] <markelhas0> i'll try to install it again
[03:18] <Flannel> Err_: you don't need to format any of the partitions, just partition them.  the installers for your various things can format the existing paritions with no problems
[03:18] <markelhas0> hope next talk will be from kubuntu
[03:18] <markelhas0> :P
[03:18] <dudesmithy> I'm having an installation issue with Edgy..Trying to install to a Dell Dimension 8400 with an Nvidia GeForce 6800 video card and a Dell P991 monitor.

=== coolcubix_ is now known as CoolCubix
[03:18] <LjL> Flannel: well, not strictly true... if you *have* swap space available, then the Linux kernel may decide to swap out executable pages in favor of data (file caching). if you don't have the space in the first place, it won't -- however, i agree that's *not* a valid reason to choose swap size. you have other means to control that.
[03:19] <markelhas0> se  u
[03:19] <markelhas0> thanks
[03:19] <sidewalk`> you guys
[03:19] <sidewalk`> how do i get a font called fixed, working under ubuntu?
[03:19] <Delkster> klees, glxgears isn't a good benchmark, but usually getting only 250 fps might tell that you don't have direct rendering (i.e. hardware acceleration)
[03:19] <sidewalk`> i mainly need it for the gnome-terminal
[03:19] <Delkster> If 3D acceleration seems to work fine elsewhere in real applications, don't worry about it
[03:20] <GaiaX11> Err_: if your win is XP then make a C ntfs; then create a swap and a / raiserfs. Or you can follow Flannel advise with is easier :-)
[03:20] <Xaero_Vincent> the ATI drivers only report 250 somthing FPS with GLXGEARS
[03:20] <Delkster> If you aren't sure, you could try the glxinfo command and see if it says that you have direct rendering enabled
[03:20] <LjL> sidewalk`: if it's a bitmapped font, you need to enable bitmapped fonts. i believe that's done by running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config"
[03:20] <LjL> Ubotu, please tell sidewalk` about fonts
[03:20] <mzli> Err_: xp use fat format.do not use ntfs
[03:21] <LjL> mzli: ?
[03:21] <dob1> hi
[03:21] <weezl> uhm.. after installing ubuntu for the first time the gnome-service-deamon (thats what it was called iirc) crashes, then the bug window pops up. after saving the file, it crashes again and the bugwindow appears again... and thats all i can do... anything i can do besides reinstalling the system... will that even help?
[03:21] <weezl> crashes right after login
[03:21] <dob1> there is somewhere a deb package for ubuntu with 2.6.18 ?
[03:21] <LjL> dob1: not a supported one for sure
[03:21] <mzli> <LjL> linux operates ntfs not so smoth.
[03:21] <ArrenLex> I just compiled mplayer 1.0rc1 on my newly upgraded Ubuntu Edgy system. It refuses to play mp3 files properly -- I hear only static, and it prints "mpg123: Can't rewind stream by <XX> bits!%" where XX is some number that varies from 1 to probably 200.
[03:21] <ArrenLex> I did not notice anything weird during configure and make; ./configure was run without arguments. My old mplayer-1.0pre7try2 I had lying around plays the same mp3s fine, as does the mplayer-1.0pre8 from ubuntu's repositories. All other files play back fine. What might the problem be?
[03:22] <dungodung> so, can anyone please help me? X server down after an apt-get-like upgrade to edgy
[03:22] <sidewalk`> LjL: i turned it on, what do i do next?
[03:22] <jerp> yeha, do the............ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
[03:22] <jrib> ArrenLex: maybe you didn't have the required deps
[03:22] <Err_> Why would I want to use reiserFS rather than ext3? Is this compatible with windows, why is ext3 the default is reiser is faster?
[03:23] <dungodung> jerp: will try
[03:23] <Squeee> dungodung: look for how to disable composite in X in edgy
[03:23] <LjL> sidewalk`: try using it. but i'm not even sure it's really a bitmap font, i just said *if* it's a bitmap font
[03:23] <ArrenLex> jrib: if so, why didn't ./configure complain? Why did everything compile fine?
[03:23] <cornell> Can anybody point me to good help for getting a belkin wifi working on an IBM thinkpad.  It's dual booted with winxp and wifi works great with winxp, but I can't for the life of me get it to work under ubuntu (except for one 15 minute period)
[03:23] <mzli> <dungodung>that happens. maybe you should reapt the x
[03:23] <dob1> LjL: ok if it is not official, just a generic kernel 2.6.18 with all the modules, you know where to find it ?
[03:23] <dungodung> Squeee: don't know how/can't
[03:23] <jrib> ArrenLex: it wouldn't complain, it would just compile without the option.  Some options are [autodetect] 
[03:23] <Squeee> google
[03:23] <jerp> ya shouldn't have done the apt-get install of edgy
[03:23] <LjL> Err_: ext3 is the default because it's older and more tested, i think, and it is compatible with its predecessor ext2
[03:23] <tonyyarusso> cornell: Check the ThinkWiki for your model, or the Ubuntu Wiki for the card.
[03:23] <LjL> !ext3
[03:23] <ubotu> ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org
[03:23] <jrib> ArrenLex: at the end of ./configure it should list what is enabled and what is disabled
[03:23] <faddatp> Hey, we are trying to install 6.10 on a machine with an Intel G965 Chipset.  We have an IDE CD-ROM that the LiveCD can't find once it has passed the bootloader screen.  Any advice on how to make it find the CD?
[03:23] <ArrenLex> jrib: no, no, it told mp3 was supported, and sound plays -- just not the right sound =P
[03:24] <Squeee> you can edit the file by typing sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, go to the bottom and type in the composite section)
[03:24] <sidewalk`> LjL: i think its a bitmap font
[03:24] <faddatp> I'm unfamiliar with mixing SATA and IDE.... the CD-ROM is IDE and the Hard Disk is on SATA
[03:24] <LjL> sidewalk`: possible, since i don't have it available, and i don't have bitmap fonts enabled. try restarting X after enabling them
[03:25] <ArrenLex> jrib: http://arrenlex.diff.be/config
[03:25] <jrib> ArrenLex: idk, I don't think my mplayer uses mpg123
[03:25] <klees> Delkster: planet penguin runs smooth
[03:25] <ArrenLex> jrib: I don't even have it installed.
[03:25] <Squeee> dugodong: http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Xorg_X11_and_Transparency  scroll down to the extensions composite enabled thing and instead type disabled
[03:25] <Err_> Where is the MBR in the partition process? Why does GRUB want to go to that?
[03:25] <cornell> Little woman just came home, gotta go.  If you've an idea about wifi, please PM, thanks
[03:25] <weezl> no ideas you guys ? :/
[03:25] <ArrenLex> jrib: and never did, of which I am certain, but everything used to work.

[03:26] <dungodung> I guess that will work.. thanks guys.. I'll linger here until I get it right
[03:26] <LjL> dudesmithy: tried starting in safe graphics mode?
[03:26] <jrib> ArrenLex: yeah, you're right, it says mp3lib :/
[03:26] <dudesmithy> LjL : Yes...I've tried regular and Safe...It just puts vertical lines and screens....
[03:27] <swamptu> hi I am running livecd....i cannot get into "Documents and Settings"  i can see on my windows partition, i can get into folder with no space in em
[03:27] <Delkster> klees, I wouldn't worry about it then
[03:27] <jrib> ArrenLex: #mplayer guys can probably figure it out
[03:27] <Delkster> klees, I can't check myself because I don't have fglrx installed
[03:27] <klees> Delkster: u have an ATI card?
[03:27] <ArrenLex> jrib: I already asked there. Three hours ago. I've yet to get a reply. =P

[03:29] <CarlFK> trying to build MySqlWorkbench -./configure says "configure: error: OpenGL headers not found. Please install OpenGL development files." - anyone know what I should apt-get?
[03:29] <fontppp> does anybody have a cupsd.conf I can grab ?
[03:30] <jrib> ArrenLex: do you have /usr/local/etc/mplayer/codecs.conf
[03:30] <dudesmithy> mzli: Do you have any thoughts?
[03:30] <ArrenLex> jrib: no.
[03:30] <mzli> <dudesmithy>not so much. I configure it with many paras, it's not same.

[03:31] <klees> how can i uninstall totem-mozilla without uninstalling ubuntu-desktop =\
[03:31] <jrib> ArrenLex: because ubuntu packages install this file for you? because it's a new version? because like I said, I'm not sure and we are just trying this? :)
[03:31] <ArrenLex> klees: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. You can remove it without problems.
[03:31] <LjL> !ubuntu-desktop | klees
[03:31] <ubotu> klees: k/ed/x/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[03:32] <ArrenLex> jrib: okay, I'll try.
[03:32] <Huister> hi all, anyone know how to get past the parted step in the installer?  I am trying to dualboot on the same hard drive and the version of parted on the CD crashes outputting "No Implementation: Support for opening ntfs file systems is not implemented yet."
[03:32] <mzli> <ArrenLex>both is good,but compile some time are frustrating.

[03:32] <ArrenLex> mzli: not for mplayer, not for me.
[03:33] <mzli> <ArrenLex>:P
[03:33] <klees> LjL: when upgrading what?
[03:33] <LjL> klees: ubuntu.
[03:33] <jared555> what partitions should be made if you want to be able to resize almost any partition with lvm without rebooting into a livecd?
[03:33] <klees> ok
[03:34] <ArrenLex> jrib: didn't help.
[03:34] <Huister> well for me, i don't really need to resize the partitions, i already have linux partitions set up
[03:34] <jrib> ArrenLex: can you pastebin all the mplayer output?
[03:35] <ArrenLex> jrib: it just keeps repeating "mpg123: Can't rewind stream by XX bits!%" for as long as the file is playing, and I hear static.
[03:35] <Huister> but i cant get pass one of the steps in the installer because it tries to open the partitioner and crashes the installer
[03:35] <weezl> whats the keyboard shortcut to open up the filebrowser?
[03:36] <beowulf-afk> hola

[03:37] <Lubix> does anyone know anything about monodev
[03:38] <mikeymike-linux> where is the preferences > sessions > startup   stuff located.....
[03:38] <ArrenLex> jrib: http://arrenlex.diff.be/mplayer here it is for about ten seconds of a song, until I killed it...
[03:38] <beowulf-afk> looking into getting ubuntu, been using suse for a couple of years now... anyone have some information on it?
[03:38] <smoenux> weezl, try ... system > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts --->> Home folder shortcut key... set one up :P
[03:38] <mikeymike-linux> the gui isnt working right
[03:38] <Lubix> please help with moNO!!
[03:38] <jrib> ArrenLex: I bet it's 64 bit related, I got a couple of hits on google and the ones I saw were all 64bit
=== dv_ is now known as dv^zzz
[03:39] <weezl> problem is that i have this odd gnome-setting-daemon crash bug thingy
[03:39] <ArrenLex> jrib: My system is completely 32-bit.
[03:39] <weezl> and this is kinda my first time using linux in any way. so im kind of lost :p
[03:39] <smoenux> lol
[03:39] <allRblong2us> hi
[03:39] <GaiaX11> mzli: do you mean that using ntfs for win xp we have to face writing issues under linux? Is it? The it is better to install xp in a fat formatted partition.
[03:39] <smoenux> I remember being there a couple of weeks ago
[03:40] <smoenux> weezl, what are you looking for?
[03:40] <wastrel> "ubunto"
[03:40] <weezl> best would be a solution for that bug
[03:40] <allRblong2us> I have a huge issue with sis driver
[03:40] <allRblong2us> the whole screen is flickering and isn't flickering with PuppyOS
[03:40] <weezl> i read in a forum that i should delete everything from /tmp wherever that is
[03:40] <smoenux> ah
[03:41] <mikeymike-linux> whats the ubuntu channel for beryl
[03:41] <mzli> <GaiaX11>exactly.
[03:41] <ArrenLex> weezl: I advise you not to delete /tmp.
[03:41] <ArrenLex> weezl: /tmp is automatically cleaned at boot.
[03:41] <weezl> good to know
[03:41] <ArrenLex> weezl: /tmp stores temporary files -- like lockfiles -- which applications need. You can also put your own temporary files there. It is the "temporary directory".
[03:41] <tonyyarusso> mikeymike-linux: #ubuntu-xgl for desktop effects
[03:41] <mikeymike-linux> thank you
[03:41] <jrib> ArrenLex: hmm interesting.  You want to try my deb and see if it happens?
[03:41] <weezl> so, how to get rid of that bug then ?
[03:42] <Trainstroker> E: mozilla-browser: subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 132
[03:42] <weezl> is there a known solution?
[03:42] <Trainstroker> help plz
[03:42] <weezl> or do i better download and install 6.06?
[03:42] <ArrenLex> jrib: I told you, the ubuntu debs work, and my own old debs work. It's something about the way it's compiled on my new system which breaks it.
[03:42] <smoenux> 6.06 is very nice, weezl
[03:42] <smoenux> I found it to be very stable
[03:42] <ArrenLex> weezl: sorry, what bug is this?
[03:43] <smoenux> but if someone can help you with the bug you are having, then it's prob better
[03:43] <weezl> gnome-settings-daemon crashes after login
[03:43] <jrib> ArrenLex: your old 1.0rc1 deb worked?
[03:43] <goudkov> hi guys, what's a good app to track time spent on various tasks and projects? anybody knows? i tried taglog, but it's really bad and seems dated
[03:43] <sidewalk`> hmms, nope the fonts-thing still isnt working
[03:43] <ArrenLex> weezl: Oh. Not familiar with gnome, sorry...
[03:43] <sidewalk`> i dont know how to get the font called "fixed" working with gnome-terminal
[03:43] <weezl> im neither... :p
[03:43] <sidewalk`> it works with Eterm
[03:43] <mzli> <smoenux> 6.06 is very nice,  -----so feel I
[03:43] <ArrenLex> jrib: my old mplayer-1.0rc7 deb worked, and ubuntu's mplayer-1.0rc8 deb worked.
[03:44] <weezl> so im going for 6.06 i guess... ?!
[03:44] <ArrenLex> jrib: I had compiled mplayer-1.0rc8 recently after upgrading to edgy, and found static.
[03:44] <ArrenLex> jrib: and the same in rc1
[03:44] <allRblong2us> how can I switch to ubuntu from kubuntu?
[03:44] <jrib> ArrenLex: weird then, no idea what's going on
[03:44] <mzli> <weezl>6.06 is not so problematic as 6.10
[03:44] <weezl> good
[03:44] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and then follow the instructions at http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde to remove gnome.
[03:45] <Alethes> I keep hearing that edgy has issues, but I haven't had a single prob heh
[03:45] <ArrenLex> jrib: then that makes two of us! :D Thanks a lot for trying, anyway.
[03:45] <weezl> too bad that i cant start to play with ubuntu today then :/ but thanks for the advise
[03:45] <Alethes> guess I'm lucky
[03:45] <ArrenLex> Alethes: As long you don't have any nonstandard settings, you won't have problems.
[03:45] <Alethes> ah
[03:45] <ArrenLex> Alethes: i.e. only the boring people have no issues.
[03:45] <GaiaX11> mzli: why linux developers do not find a way to face this ntfs writing problem. It is really annoying to see the message even as root not been able to change files in ntfs.
[03:45] <ArrenLex> Which makes sense!
[03:45] <Alethes> :D
[03:45] <Alethes> I'm not a gamer, for one

[03:46] <wastrel> GaiaX11:  microsoft has not released the specs for NTFS
[03:46] <Trainstroker> help
[03:46] <ArrenLex> GaiaX11: address it how? ntfs is closed and patented and proprietary. It's not like they have a spec and all they have to do is implement it. They have to hack the drivers and reverse-engineer things to try to figure out how it works without any knowledge of what the developers saw. It's hard.
[03:46] <smoenux> GaiaX11 , apparently you can do a workaround .... to access NTFS, but it's risky
[03:47] <ivx> i hear there is some shooting game that runs on linux. did anyone hear about it/know about it?
[03:47] <weezl> good nites :D
[03:47] <allRblong2us> I have installed chost 368, is it better 686 with a PIII?
[03:47] <smoenux> ivx ... lol .... UT2k
[03:47] <allRblong2us> I wonder whether I need to change the installation
[03:47] <mzli> <GaiaX11>me 2,but this is not linux problem. it's m$'s tricks.
[03:47] <ablyss> ivx, unreal tournament 2004 works wondefully on linux w/ gl video driver
[03:47] <ArrenLex> allR: I don't think you'll notice any significant difference, but 586 is PIII, I believe.
[03:47] <JuGonORT> mmmm
[03:47] <smoenux> ivx ... and doom 3 :P
[03:47] <GaiaX11> mzli wastrel: when it happens i have a feeling that even root is not all powerful to deal with MS.
[03:48] <smoenux> ivx, any id game for that matter
[03:48] <mikeymike-linux> #ubuntu-xgl is dead
[03:48] <allRblong2us> F@^%@#$%!!!
[03:48] <mikeymike-linux> lol
[03:48] <allRblong2us> 586?
[03:48] <ivx> smoenux sweet i'm not much into games much but i think i am going to buy something
[03:48] <ablyss> ivx, linux wine has progress direct X support that runs some windows quite wonderfully too
[03:48] <allRblong2us> so I need to start all over? or I can't change that with a current installation/
[03:48] <ArrenLex> No. I lied. 686.
[03:48] <ivx> ablyss hmm
[03:48] <RogerBacon> hi, did linux have cleartype support ?
[03:48] <ivx> thanks for the info
[03:48] <phargle> need at least 786 or 886
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> gnome-settings-something-daemon
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> does that sound right?
[03:49] <phargle> id prefer a 986
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> im having issues with that i believe......
[03:49] <mzli> <GaiaX11>it's not that problem. ntfs Format is not support well . operating will be risky. so the best way is not change it by linux.
[03:49] <ablyss> mikeymike-linux: i enjoy being able to watch tv on my linux machine.. last time I tried xgl, no tv drivers were supported
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> ablyss, ah i dont have a tuner so its okay
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> :)
[03:49] <ablyss> <thumbs up> :)
[03:49] <mikeymike-linux> x security is highly compromised with xgl and beryl...
[03:50] <smoenux> ablyss, you can set up 2 different sessions
[03:50] <mzli>  <GaiaX11>but it's not linux problem. windown never support ext3.what about this?
[03:50] <mikeymike-linux> locking the workstation is easily defeated by alt-tabbing
[03:50] <allRblong2us> is it possible to upgrade to 686 from a 383 installation?
[03:50] <mikeymike-linux> is anyone aware of this issue?
[03:50] <allRblong2us> just wondering
[03:50] <GaiaX11> mzli: But this is the feeling. How on earth cannot root deal with it! Just a bad feeling :-(
[03:50] <Arrick_Idle> hello, I have a ubuntu breezy install with a static IP, and I cant for some reason get through to my pastebot which listens on port 8080, can someone please help me out with ths?
[03:50] <mzli> <mikeymike-linux>linux?
[03:50] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: "upgrade"? How do you picture that? The packages are the same. Just install a different kernel and you're done.
[03:50] <mikeymike-linux> huh
[03:50] <nixdude> hello
[03:50] <riddlebox> I installed asterisk, and now I want to make it start at boot?
[03:51] <mzli> <GaiaX11>ntfs is not belong linxu . that's the reason.
[03:51] <nixdude> i just upgraded to edgy and i am having a few problems
[03:51] <allRblong2us> ArrenLex: 'cause in Gentoo don't recommend that
[03:52] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: gentoo is a source distro. The whole point of compiling everything from source is to eke out a 0.0002 second speed-up due to compiler optimisations. Unless you optimise it correctly, you won't even get that and, gentoo will be completely pointless =P
[03:52] <ablyss> Arrick_Idle: telnet localhost 8080 and see what happens
[03:52] <mzli> <nixdude>upgraded sucess is lucky.
[03:52] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: the packages on ubuntu are precompiled for major arch. That'll have to be good enough for you.
[03:52] <nixdude> ya but this is a released version
[03:52] <Arrick_Idle> ablyss, unable to connect connection refused
[03:52] <nixdude> not total success, xserver didnt work but i knew how to fix it
[03:53] <allRblong2us> ArrenLex: that's what I am saying, if I just upgrade the kernel to 686 will my packages be borken?
[03:53] <allRblong2us> or my system to say at least
[03:53] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: No.
[03:53] <nixdude> but some programs and stuff arent working
[03:53] <nixdude> like gdesklets wont start at all...
[03:53] <Trainstroker> error exit status 132 PLZ HELP
[03:53] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: actually, there is no 686 kernel or edgy, just 386 and generic. So, uh, nevermind.
[03:53] <ablyss> Arrick_Idle: looks like port 8080 has not open
[03:54] <Arrick_Idle> ablyss, how do I open it?

[03:55] <ablyss> nixdude: here's the link for you to try http://www.gnome-dock.org/trac
[03:55] <nixdude> sure thanks
[03:56] <nbjayme> Help promote banning Novell from contributing to FOSS projects.  inform FOSS project leaders to not allow Novell from using/contributing to the code. :(
[03:56] <nixdude> will let you know in a while if i can get it to work
[03:56] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: use the "generic" kernel in Edgy. That's all you need.
[03:56] <wickednix> would the ubuntu java channel be a better channel to ask questions about java runtime?
[03:56] <ubuntugrrrrr> can anyone help? im trying to compile make-3.81 and it says there is no compiler... i dont think that is quite right
[03:56] <ArrenLex> wickednix: They don't answer questions except about the language itself. What's your problem?

[03:57] <wheelswitch> im am having a problem when installing ssh, the packages in the repository are newer then the ones ssh relys on, any ideas>
[03:57] <sethk> allRblong2us, waste of time
[03:57] <reiki> allRblong2us, recompile edgy?
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> what does this mean
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> mikeymike@mikeymike-linux:~$ gnome-settings-daemon
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> You can only run one xsettings manager at a time; exiting
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> whats running thats stopping me from running that?
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> how can i figure that out?
[03:58] <sethk> wheelswitch, that doesn't exactly make sense.  What, specifically, are you seeing?
[03:58] <strabes> mikeymike-linux, that means that it's already running
[03:58] <mikeymike-linux> well how can i restart it
[03:58] <mzli> allRblong2us, recompile edgy? You are strong!
[03:58] <BrandoXxX> How do I dual boot ubuntu and windows with ubuntu already installed?
[03:58] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us: how exactly are you 'compiling' edgy and why?
[03:58] <sethk> allRblong2us, it's not really difficult to do, but it's a waste of time
[03:58] <strabes> mikeymike-linux, killall gnome-settings-daemon

[03:58] <strabes> mikeymike-linux, then run it again
[03:59] <allRblong2us> I should;ve chosen 686, I regret not having, what's more I hate the fack that during installation it didn't give that option
[03:59] <Err_> how easy is it for windows to access ext3 w/ 3rd party programs?
[03:59] <espectro> help guys i am trying to update to 6.10 from dapper using only the iso. i mount the iso as a dir, but when using update-manager it says it cant find Packages.gz. So i try to create it with dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null > Packages but i get permission denied. This was posted in a forum. can someone help me?
[03:59] <sethk> wheelswitch, sounds like your repositories are in an inconsistent state.  Update them.  If that doesn't help, recreate them.
[03:59] <mikeymike-linux> hmm
[03:59] <mzli> <allRblong2us> You compile the kernal or all of them?
[03:59] <ArrenLex> wheelswitch: update your repos. openssh-client (= 1:4.3p2-5ubuntu1)
[03:59] <mikeymike-linux> taht didnt fix my problem.......
[03:59] <wheelswitch> i have updated
[03:59] <reiki> allRblong2us, there was no 686 when I installed edgy. I thought I wanted 386, but 386 has no dual core (smp) support. Back to generic and sho 'nuff both cores runnin
[03:59] <outchy> i have a question about installing ubuntu on a g4 powerbook ... i can't get it to boot from CD and i've spent the last 2 hours scouring the internet for the answer.  md5sum checks out, it just won't read the cd on boot when i hold down C.
[03:59] <mikeymike-linux> anyone know why this is happening to me?
[03:59] <vitriol> anybody know what package i need to install to get the c library man pages?
[03:59] <outchy> does anyone know?
[03:59] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: restart your computer
[03:59] <sethk> espectro, run it with sudo to get rid of the permissions problem
[04:00] <wheelswitch> sethk, i have sudp apt-get update, didnt help, how do i recreate?
[04:00] <beowulf-afk> hola
[04:00] <allRblong2us> reiki: thanks
[04:00] <BrandoXxX> How do I dual boot ubuntu and windows with ubuntu already installed?
[04:00] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: or just restart X (ctrl + alt + backspace)
[04:00] <mikeymike-linux> i cant select any windows for focus by just clicking on them.... i have to click their title bars... i cant alt+leftbutton drag anything... i cant alt-tab.. i cant ctrl+alt+left/right to switch workspaces.....
[04:00] <mikeymike-linux> strabes, its a settings issue
[04:00] <espectro> sethk: it doesn't work, same problem
[04:00] <sethk> wheelswitch, get hold of a copy of the one that is on a system immediately after installation, then do the update on that copy.

[04:00] <allRblong2us> I'll be back with ubuntu... now I am in puppyOs which doesn't have the screen flickering, but ubuntu flickers the LCD screen, why does it do this?
[04:00] <espectro> i think it doesn't work because there is a ubuntu symlink pointing to . inside the iso
[04:00] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: ok w/e
[04:00] <sethk> espectro, it can't fail for permissions that way, so it can't be the same problem.
[04:00] <beowulf-afk> looking to make a switch to ubuntu from suse, can I ask some ?s?
[04:01] <mikeymike-linux> strabes, it just loads back into the same thing.....
[04:01] <sethk> espectro, paste exactly what you type, and what you see, to the paste bot
[04:01] <sethk> espectro, the paste web site, that is.
[04:01] <espectro> espectro@fjl:~/edgy$ sudo dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null > Packages

[04:01] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: what exactly is your problem?
[04:01] <ablyss> BrandoXxX: only way I can think of w/ out reinstalling linux is to have two harddrives put linux on the one w/ out linux, and unplug the one w/ linux
[04:01] <reiki> allRblong2us, what's your refresh set at?
[04:01] <wickednix> anyone link me to a good howto on JRE
[04:01] <sethk> espectro, that's after whatever mistake you are making.  we have to see the entire thing
[04:01] <mikeymike-linux> strabes, i just said it
[04:01] <smoenux> can someone tell me how I can get Synaptic to install a older version of nvidia-glx ??
[04:01] <espectro> the edgy dir is inside my home/myuser dir
[04:01] <XxXBrAnDoNXxX> ablyss:lol thats what I was trying to avoid
[04:01] <ivx> hey how can i install apache with php extension, but close off port 80 on my computer, i need it just for local php developement
[04:01] <ArrenLex> allRblong2us:  the generic kernel includes smp support
[04:02] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: i intermittently have the first problem you mentioned
[04:02] <reiki> wickednix, for Edgy?
[04:02] <nixdude> oh cairo dock needs xgl installed huh?
[04:02] <ablyss> XxXBrAnDoNXxX: sorry I meant to say put windows on the hd w/ out linux
[04:02] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: are you using xgl/beryl
[04:02] <mikeymike-linux> strabes whats causing it?
[04:02] <mikeymike-linux> yes i am
[04:02] <allRblong2us> reiki: puppyOS has horSync 48.0 48.0 vertSync 60-60, can I change this manually in ubunutu?
[04:02] <sethk> espectro, that doesn't help.  you'll have to literally paste what you are typing, and the response.
[04:02] <nixdude> well i guess i will have to do that first

[04:02] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: i'm not sure but it's kinda annoying
[04:02] <mikeymike-linux> but it doesn't matter if im actually using beryl or not because in fall-back on gnome...... the same symptoms occur
[04:02] <espectro> sethk: that's exactly what i typed, i copied and paste

[04:02] <ArrenLex> mikeymike: what symptoms are these, sorry?
[04:02] <Arrick_Idle> ablyss, I am running the bot under sudo, nogo
[04:02] <mikeymike-linux> i cant select any windows for focus by just clicking on them.... i have to click their title bars... i cant alt+leftbutton drag anything... i cant alt-tab.. i cant ctrl+alt+left/right to switch workspaces.....
[04:02] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: ok that's good to know because i haven't used metacity in awhile
[04:02] <sethk> espectro, I've only seen one line so far.  maybe you typed it before I was watching.  in any event, I don't want it typed.  I want it pasted.
[04:02] <mikeymike-linux> yeah
[04:03] <allRblong2us> can I set the refresh rate manually in ubuntu?
[04:03] <mikeymike-linux> its not BERYL its something gnome-related?
[04:03] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: so it's probably some setting issue in gconf or something
[04:03] <reiki> allRblong2us, I can change my refresh in Edgy, yes. at 60 you may be strobing with incandescant or flourescent lighting. NEVER have it on 60 :)

[04:06] <azureal> anyone know why gaim would suddenly crash when user chats (on new kernel) ?

[04:06] <ArrenLex> barnetod: oh, you mean yourself, not others =P
[04:06] <ablyss> Arrick_Idle: try open Terminal and typing tail -f /var/log/syslog then try to run the bot

[04:06] <tom__> <XxXBrAnDoNXxX> install windows xp and then repair grub
[04:06] <espectro> so it seems i am doing it ok
[04:06] <ianmacgregor> espectro: YEs, and that is assuming you are logged i as root.. which is dangerous
[04:06] <espectro> sethk: the override file should be /dev/null
[04:07] <mzli> <wickednix> reiki, edgy is stBLE? not as dapper
[04:07] <sethk> espectro, the third argument is optional, that's true. but /dev/null doesn't make sense as an override file
[04:07] <beowulf-afk> how does ubuntu compare with suse in ease of installation? in seeing printers and vid cards etc?
[04:07] <ArrenLex> XxXBrAnDoNXxX: you'll just have to restore grub after you install windows, is all.
[04:07] <wickednix> i see
[04:07] <reiki> wickednix, I believe it's fine if you are ok with tweaking things. If you want rock solid for everyday use, you might want to just move up to Dapper and see how that goes for ya

[04:09] <wickednix> is it easy to upgrade or is it better to reinstall
[04:09] <ianmacgregor> espectro: Are you using sudo?
[04:09] <espectro> no i am not
[04:09] <axisys> anyone has any idea on this issue http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/GG9Sjl78.html?
[04:09] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: in case you want to subscribe to it or something
[04:10] <espectro> why should i? the dir is inside my home dir
[04:10] <ablyss> Arrick_Idle: nothing to see.. you can close that Terminal :)
[04:10] <mzli> <wickednix>reinstall
[04:10] <smoenux> can someone tell me how I can get Synaptic to install a older version of nvidia-glx ??
[04:10] <ianmacgregor> espectro: Let me rephrase that: Should you be using sudo?
[04:10] <tom__> wikednix upgrade is automatic, i found it very easy (as a new user )
[04:10] <Arrick_Idle> ok
[04:10] <sethk> espectro, I already told you to use sudo, and you said it didn't work
[04:10] <Arrick_Idle> did
[04:10] <wheelswitch> sethk, i have tried to look up info on recreating repositories but cant find any, any chance you can point me in the right direction?
[04:10] <wickednix> mzli, nodes
[04:10] <ianmacgregor> espectro: Inside your $HOME?
[04:10] <mzli> <wickednix>upgrade is easy broken.
[04:10] <sethk> espectro, so make up your mind.
[04:10] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I have nvidia card in here too. Ubuntu has drivers for nVidia. You may have a generic nv driver when you first install and then you can get a better driver from the repositories right in Ubuntu if needed
[04:10] <espectro> it is inside /home/myusername/edgy
[04:10] <wickednix> ok ok do not confuse me people
[04:10] <wickednix> I like fresh installs
[04:10] <ablyss> Arrick_Idle: might be a program related issue and over my head.
[04:10] <sethk> wheelswitch, someone on the channel should have a "vanilla" one, after a new installation.
[04:10] <espectro> why can't i write there?
[04:10] <Ostizzle> I just finished installing Ubuntu Edgy and am having problems. While I was installing from the LiveCD everything seemed to be working fine, I was looking around and doing stuff and checking everything out. Once I finished the installation and restarted, the login GUI came up and I logged in. After accepting my user/pass it showed the splash screen and the the little icons of the stuff that was loading. It starts to play the star
[04:10] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I have not yet found a need to install nVidia drivers from outside Ubuntu
[04:11] <strabes> mikeymike-linux: i found a fix - http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-2385-focus
[04:11] <ArrenLex> Ostizzle: your message was cut off at "the star".
[04:11] <beowulf-afk> reiki,  sweet, I assume it finds DSL and router paths just as easy?
[04:11] <sethk> espectro, the program isn't doing what you think, and the permissions is being denied for a different operation than you assume.  However, did you, or didn't you, do it with sudo?
[04:11] <Ostizzle> thank you sir
[04:11] <ianmacgregor> espectro: I suspect that it may be iwned by root
[04:11] <barnetod> hey guys whats a good c++ compiler and ide program for linux?
[04:11] <ArrenLex> Ostizzle: I told you the first time but you weren't reading =P
[04:11] <mzli> <wickednix>UPgrading is easy to cause many problem. reinstall is better choice for new one.
[04:11] <espectro> ok i touched the file with sudo
[04:11] <ArrenLex> barnetod: the de facto c++ compiler is g++.
[04:11] <espectro> but dpkg-scanpackages with sudo still doesn't work
[04:11] <Ostizzle> must've missed it, thank you arrenlex
[04:12] <sethk> barnetod, anjuta is a good ide
[04:12] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I am on dsl with router dslmodem/router combo and Ubuntu found it all and connected to network. I didn't have to do anything
[04:12] <sethk> barnetod, gcc/g++ is pretty much the only compiler in town
[04:12] <beowulf-afk> Also understand Gnome is the default gui, been using kde mostly, hows the gnome aspect? alot different?
[04:12] <espectro> espectro@fjl:~/edgy$ sudo dpkg-scanpackages  . file.txt > Packages
[04:12] <espectro> bash: Packages: Permission denied
[04:12] <barnetod> can i use apt-get to load it?
[04:12] <reiki> wickednix, if Breezy is running fine I think the upgrade to Dapper was one of the smoothest I've ever had

[04:12] <kev_b> Anyone know how to 'shred' a directory?
[04:12] <ArrenLex> beowulf-afk: not very different. Burn yourself a livecd and find out.
[04:12] <wickednix> mzli, reiki, thank you
[04:12] <ianmacgregor> espectro: If you "touched" the file with sudo, then it is owned by root. Your user won't be able to write/edit/delete that file.
[04:13] <mzli> <reiki> I mean from dapper to edgy.
[04:13] <espectro> damn, i am tryung sudo su , i don't understand this permission problem
[04:13] <mzli>  reiki: :)
[04:13] <wickednix> downloading drapp
[04:13] <reiki> mzli, my dapper to edgy upgrade was a bit bumpy.
[04:13] <beowulf-afk> cool, one last question though, hows the package selections? I like graphics and web work
[04:13] <mzli> <espectro>sudo su ??? why this?
[04:13] <espectro> that worked
[04:14] <wickednix> so breezy to drapp is smmoth?
[04:14] <raghu206> when i start mplayer to play video file it gives error message "error in opening the selected video_out(-vo) device.pls help what to do ?
[04:14] <Madpilot> beowulf-afk, there's something like 17,000 packages in Ubuntu's repos, you'll probably be able to find what you need :)
[04:14] <espectro> mzli: i dont understand, but bash complains, doing sudo bash and then dpkg-scanpackages worked
[04:14] <mzli> <reiki>I upgrade 6.06 to 6.10, failed. x was broken. and i reinstalled.
[04:14] <reiki> beowulf-afk, the Gimp has almost everything photoshop has but some folks coming from photoshop don't care for the interface. It grows on ya :)  Web work I do all hand coded anyways... or CMS these days
[04:14] <kev_b> Anyone know how to 'shred' a directory?
[04:14] <ArrenLex> raghu206: what driver are you trying to use? If you don't know, pastebin the stuff what shows up in the command line when you start playing a movie.
[04:14] <sethk> espectro, could be the sudo configuration
[04:15] <reiki> mzli: I had to install Edgy clean to get it working. Some folks had no trouble at all... *shrug*
[04:15] <uRblong2us> hi I am back with this insane  screen I am trying to fix
[04:15] <wickednix> I think i am going to go with option one and do a fresh install
[04:15] <wastrel> espectro:  do sudo -i   instead of sudo bash
[04:15] <espectro> this is a freshly installed dapper
[04:15] <beowulf-afk> hehe ... sweet, thanks :) got a AMD 64 (X2) cpu so I hope it hasnt any large issues with that kinda processor
[04:15] <mzli> <espectro>sudo means super user(root) do. su is the command change to root. You just chose one command is good.
[04:15] <uRblong2us> now... can I edit xorg.conf mannually?
[04:15] <markelhas0> hi
[04:15] <espectro> mzli: i meant sudo bash, sorry
[04:15] <markelhas0> back again
[04:15] <wastrel> I believe sudo bash lands you in a non-login shell - may be the problem...
[04:15] <ArrenLex> uRblong2us: a) where did you go? b) with a text editor. sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:15] <uRblong2us> or I have to go with dpkg re-configure xrog-server?
[04:15] <reiki> wickednix, breezy to dapper was one of the best upgrades. I think you'll be fine
[04:15] <mzli> <reiki>Yes. that's what i mey.
[04:15] <Ostizzle> While I was installing from the LiveCD everything was working fine, I could use apps and look around, etc.  Once I finished the installation and restarted, the login GUI came up and I logged in.  After accepting my user/pass, it showed the splash screen and all the little icons of the stuff it was loading.  It begins to play the startup sound but stops about half way through and drops me to a bare desktop, no icons, menu or anyt
[04:15] <Ostizzle> I can't right-click to get any type of menu or anything.  I can get to a terminal by pressing ctrl-alt-f1 but don't know anything about the unix command line.  Any ideas on how to get the GUI to load properly?
[04:15] <uRblong2us> ArrenLex: thanks
[04:16] <mzli> <espectro>that's ok. what's your problem now?
[04:16] <Madpilot> beowulf-afk, not many;  you might want to still run the 32bit version of Ubuntu on it, there are some issues w/ the full 64bit version (no Flash, for example. The problems are mostly with the non-Free stuff, though)
[04:16] <markelhas0> WindDragon: kubuntu just working fine
[04:16] <espectro> update-managed didn't like the repository and disabled it, damn
[04:16] <markelhas0> thanks
[04:16] <reiki> uRblong2us, first try System -> Preferences -> Screen resolution
[04:16] <kev_b> Anyone know how to make the 'shred' command work recursively?
[04:16] <butterflywifemay> hey everyone how are you?
[04:16] <raghu206> ArrenLex, i am getting the same error i have said when i ply thru mplayer gui
[04:17] <espectro> what i am trying to do, is to use update-manager -c without downloading from the net
[04:17] <espectro> since i have an edgy iso
[04:17] <ArrenLex> raghu: yes, I know you're getting that error; what video output driver are you using?
[04:17] <beowulf-afk> ack!!!  flash is almost like a necessity these days
[04:17] <espectro> tried to install it as a repository in apt
[04:17] <azureal> sethk, if /usr/src/linux points to a different kernel than i am currently running, do you really think that would cause a gaim crash..?
[04:17] <sethk> kev_b, you need to write a small shell loop
[04:17] <reiki> beowulf-afk, flash works in unbuntu
[04:17] <ArrenLex> Ostizzle: that's very odd... go to that command line. Firstly, what happens if you run "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"? It should say already the latest version.
[04:17] <sethk> azureal, no, not unless you built the gaim that you are running.
[04:17] <Ostizzle> it says it's already installed
[04:17] <kev_b> sethk: I see, that's the only way then?
[04:18] <sethk> azureal, /usr/src/linux only matters during a compile.
[04:18] <sethk> kev_b, yes, but it isn't difficult to do.
[04:18] <beowulf-afk> wonder if there will ever be a flash application clone
[04:18] <reiki> beowulf-afk, personally, I'd stay with the 32bit OS for now
[04:18] <axisys> is there a channel on cdrecord?
[04:18] <kev_b> sethk: I can do that, bit annoying tho :S
[04:18] <beowulf-afk> sounds good thanks, Ill check that out
[04:18] <sethk> beowulf-afk, there is a project, but it isn't too far along yet.
[04:18] <raghu206> ArrenLex, how to know that?
[04:18] <espectro> so has anyone upgraded to edgy using a local directory as a repository?
[04:18] <sethk> kev_b, yes, but if you have no alternative ...
[04:18] <ArrenLex> raghu206: I told you how to find out.
[04:18] <ArrenLex> raghu206: what driver are you trying to use? If you don't know, pastebin the stuff what shows up in the command line when you start playing a movie.
[04:19] <wheelswitch> zomgwtfbbqhax__:  not sure
[04:19] <kev_b> sethk: hehe yup, thanks for the help
[04:19] <beowulf-afk> with reiser up on murder charges (or close to that) think it would be a fair idea to use ext3 for the file system?
[04:19] <Ostizzle> *arrenlex*  when i type sudo apt-get... it says that ubuntu desktop is already installed
[04:20] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I'm using ext3
[04:20] <Madpilot> beowulf-afk, ext3 is the Ubuntu installer's default, anyway
[04:20] <beowulf-afk> been using reiser, but doubt Ill be seeing updates for it for awhile
[04:20] <heisgreg> is it safe to keep using reiserfs?
[04:20] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I just want stuff to work. This is my everyday machine. I have Dapper for solidness (is that a word) and I can boot to Edgy while I am making sure Edgy will do everything I want (or need)
[04:21] <ArrenLex> beowulf: of course. You can't use a filesystem written by someone on murder charges, because... ... ...?
[04:21] <beowulf-afk> ArrenLex, because he wont have much time to work on it
[04:21] <rBlong2us> how may I reconfigure xorg with dpkg?
[04:21] <reiki> rBlong2us, how you doing over there... flashing stopped?
[04:21] <ArrenLex> Ostizzle: I thought it would be. Okay, paste the output of "ls -l $HOME/.."
[04:22] <beowulf-afk> what is Edgy?
[04:22] <ArrenLex> beowulf: thus the beauty of open source! Many people are working on reiserfs.
[04:22] <ArrenLex> rBlong2us: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:22] <raghu206> ArrenLex, whenn i open in terminal the video is playing but when operating thru gui of mplayer it saying this error
[04:22] <rBlong2us> reiki: mmm... yeah but now I have a orange column to the right of the screen and at the bottom another row that shows part of my screen... this is just insane
[04:22] <rBlong2us> sis driver is giving me such a hard time
[04:22] <reiki> beowulf-afk, Edgy is version 6.10 of Ubuntu. Dapper is 6.06. Edgy is brand new but (in my opinion) just a tad goofy yet... heheheh... just needs a little polishing
[04:23] <ArrenLex> raghu: I see. Then I suggest checking your gui options.
[04:23] <reiki> rBlong2us, what driver is it using?
[04:23] <beowulf-afk> ahh ok :) a little goofy in my life can be good
[04:23] <heisgreg> what do you mean by goofy?
[04:24] <Trainstroker> how do i reinstall the part of syptiv or APT or ubuntu in general that configures install packages?
[04:24] <reiki> beowulf-afk, I have a clean install of edgy on another partition and it's actually working GREAT on this machine. And now that I can play World of Warcraft in Wine again, I may start booting to it as default
[04:24] <CientificoLoco> How do I install MERCURY? is there some better program?
[04:24] <beowulf-afk> cool, that is one thing I was wondering, have never figured out how to work wine
[04:24] <reiki> heisgreg, I just meant it wasn't quite as stable as Dapper. And it required more of my attention and I am NOT a linux guru.
[04:24] <raghu206> ArrenLex, where can i fing these settings to change
[04:25] <ArrenLex> beowulf: you install it, and then you run "wine file.exe" and it runs. o_O
[04:25] <espectro> sethk: apparenty, update-manager disables third-party repositories when upgrading to new releases, so i can't do this :(
[04:25] <ArrenLex> raghu206: in whatever settings options your skin provides o_O Look for "video driver".
[04:25] <heisgreg> haha, I have been running XGL and Compiz, so sability isn't really an issue for me :)
[04:25] <beowulf-afk> then I might actually be able to play rome: total war again
[04:25] <jstew> If I need a header file how can I tell what package the file is in?
[04:25] <sethk> espectro, you could hack around it, I'm sure, but it probably isn't worth the effort.
[04:25] <reiki> heisgreg, I did xgl/compiz in dapper but found I could not run an openGL game
[04:26] <Trainstroker> how do i reinstall the part of syptiv or APT or ubuntu in general that configures install packages?
[04:26] <espectro> sethk: and when using dist-upgrade, it wants to fetch 200mb off the net for dapper updates
[04:26] <ArrenLex> jstew: headers are in the -dev packages corresponding to the libraries.
[04:26] <sethk> espectro, yes, a bit nasty.
[04:26] <CientificoLoco> How do I install MERCURY? is there some better program?
[04:26] <heisgreg> reiki, I don't know about games but my openGL screen savers seem to work fine.
[04:26] <ArrenLex> jstew: i.e. the headers for libfriedcheese is in libfriedcheese-dev
[04:27] <CientificoLoco> How do I install MERCURY in EDGY? is there some better program?
[04:27] <espectro> damn, i hate wasting cds for this
[04:27] <jstew> yeah, I know that, but isn't there an apt command I can use to search for a file?
[04:27] <ArrenLex> jstew: if you're asking "how do I find out what package contains the file "friedcheese.h", the answer is by using the second box in packages.ubuntu.com
[04:27] <Madpilot> CientificoLoco, please stop repeating yourself. What is Mercury, anyway?
[04:27] <reiki> heisgreg, yeah I kinda liked the eye candy, but I have only one game I play regularly in wine and it wouldn't run... so xgl had to go (*sniff*)
[04:27] <ArrenLex> jstew: not that I know of. I know a command that will list all the files in an installed package...
[04:27] <heisgreg> ArrenLex, yeah its apt-cache search ...
[04:27] <espectro> mercury  is a msn clone in java
[04:27] <CientificoLoco> Madpilot, sofware like msn
[04:27] <ArrenLex> heisgreg: no, that searches the apt cache for a package matching your string in its name or description.
[04:28] <CientificoLoco> Madpilot, software like msn
[04:28] <heisgreg> Thought thats what he wanted
[04:28] <ArrenLex> CuentificoLoco: well, then, I assume you want the Mercury jar file, and java to run it.
[04:28] <Madpilot> CientificoLoco, for MSN IM, use gaim
[04:28] <beowulf-afk> does amsn have an ubunto package?
[04:28] <espectro> gaim kinda sucks
[04:28] <ArrenLex> beowulf: the thing is called ubuntu, and yes.
[04:28] <beowulf-afk> sorry
[04:28] <espectro> mercury has nearly feature parity with msn
[04:28] <espectro> that's why he wants it
[04:29] <ArrenLex> espectro: gaim sucks < java[anything]  sucks. Java is total crap.
[04:29] <jordan> !info amsn
[04:29] <ubotu> amsn: An MSN messenger written in tcl. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.95-2.1 (edgy), package size 2261 kB, installed size 7752 kB
[04:29] <espectro> i agree, java for the desktop sucks, but at leasts it supportes msnp13 protocol, webcams and such
[04:29] <beowulf-afk> great thanks, how do webcams work in ubuntU :)
[04:30] <jstew> java does not suck. it has it's place. for the desktop native libs are much better though,
[04:30] <ArrenLex> beowulf: with video4linux, assuming your chipset has a driver.
[04:30] <ArrenLex> beowulf: if it doesn't, buy a different webcam, or write one =P
[04:30] <beowulf-afk> lol
[04:30] <reiki> I wonder if I can get my old wacom tablet working in ubuntu..... it's kinda like... serial connected :) I should just get a new USB one
[04:30] <beowulf-afk> old logitech quickcam
[04:30] <Pelo> beowulf-afk,  lookup your model number in the forum
[04:30] <CientificoLoco> Madpilot, I use kopete but I wann add emtocions from my contacs you know!
[04:30] <jordan> Trainstroker: Why does it need to be re-installed?
[04:31] <beowulf-afk> I have a usb tablet, worked fine in suse
[04:31] <ArrenLex> jstew: What is java's place? Browser integration... flash a lot faster and more compatible. Desktop apps? c++ is a lot faster and more compatible. What else?
[04:31] <jstew> Server side
[04:31] <beowulf-afk> thanks Pelo
[04:31] <Trainstroker> because i keep getting a shatload of errors. E: mozilla-browser: subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 132

[04:31] <Trainstroker> thats if i try to uninstall
[04:31] <kev_b> reiki: you probably can, wacom is supported well afaik
[04:31] <espectro> jsp sucks
[04:31] <ArrenLex> jstew: Java is a fantastic language you can't do anything in. It's much like knowing how to speak Esperanto.
[04:32] <beowulf-afk> understood Pelo
[04:32] <Trainstroker> if i install it give me something similar but with an error code
[04:32] <CientificoLoco> How do I install MERCURY in EDGY? is there some better program?
[04:32] <rBlong2us> hi
[04:32] <Adross> for some reason, whenever i login, nautilus uses 100% cpu. There were no solutions on the forums or launch pad, does anyone know a work around?
[04:32] <Trainstroker> E: mozilla-browser: subprocess post-installation script killed by signal (Illegal instruction)
[04:32] <reiki> no offense intended but for the longest time I thought esperanto was a salad

[04:32] <riddlebox> how can I tell if I am running the nvidia driver?
[04:32] <Pelo> CientificoLoco,  what is mercury ?
[04:32] <phpuser> alg pode me ajudar ?
[04:32] <Trainstroker> or another questions: how do i delete the cache so it redownloads the package

[04:32] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendrn mas ayuda.
[04:32] <jordan> Trainstroker: sudo dpkg-reconfigure apt
[04:32] <jstew> haha, thats actaully pretty humorous ArrenLex
[04:33] <beowulf-afk> can you play tux racer riddlebox ?
[04:33] <ArrenLex> riddlebox: cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver | grep -v "#"
[04:33] <bashir> can you have different backgrounds for different desktops in gnome?
[04:33] <espectro> riddlebox: if you see the nvidia splash when booting X, then you have it running
[04:33] <Madpilot> bashir, currently you can't, afaik
[04:33] <bashir> if i right click and change background for one desktop it changes for all
[04:33] <Trainstroker> jordan: illegal instruction

[04:33] <CientificoLoco> Pelo, , software like msn... you nick is like pelo in espanish=
[04:33] <bashir> oh that is a bummer
[04:33] <bashir> thanks anyway
[04:33] <reiki> espectro, I don't have the nvidia splash screen yet I have the nvidia driver
[04:33] <ArrenLex> draco79: a small sacrifice. Maybe a cat. A goat will get better reception, though. You will also need candles and knowledge of a few pagan rituals.
[04:34] <Pelo> CientificoLoco, ,  I think the msn equivalent is gain in ubuntu
[04:34] <ArrenLex> draco79: wireless on ubuntu is hell... search on the ubuntu forums.
[04:34] <Pelo> or gaim
[04:34] <espectro> reiki: that's because you removed it. but since he is asking that, i can bet you he doesn't know how to do it
[04:34] <rBlong2us> can anyone see what I am writing?
[04:34] <bashir> yup
[04:34] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  yes we can
[04:34] <rBlong2us> Pelo: thanks

[04:34] <kirjava> what project on launchpad should I file a bug for if there is a dodgy image?
[04:34] <draco79> thanks ArrenLex

[04:34] <reiki> espectro, I don't remember removing it.... but I may have. I didn't remove it on Edgy... I know that for sure... yet I never see it
[04:35] <rBlong2us> Madpilot: I need to add this :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xorg
[04:35] <espectro> rBlong2us: hey, if you type your password in irc, it shows as asterisks
[04:35] <CientificoLoco> Pelo, yeah but I want to add emoticons from my contacs

[04:36] <espectro> (oblig bash)
[04:36] <rBlong2us> Trainstroker: source list or that
[04:36] <John64> Does someone know what the changes to the kernel making procedure using make-kpkg due to Upstart?
[04:37] <CientificoLoco> How do I install MERCURY in EDGY? is there some better program?
[04:37] <Trainstroker> rblong2us: your repositories?
[04:37] <beowulf-afk> CientificoLoco, look for AMSN
[04:37] <Pelo> CientificoLoco,  look it up in synaptic
[04:37] <ArrenLex> CientificoLoco: this question was already answered.
[04:37] <rBlong2us> Trainstroker: yeah that's what I meant... I need to add something
[04:37] <jstew> wow, dash breaks alot of crap.
[04:37] <ArrenLex> jstew: yep.
[04:37] <Trainstroker> ok go to synaptic
[04:38] <jstew> what would happen if I symlinked /bin/sh to bash?
[04:38] <ArrenLex> jstew: Then your shell would be bash.
[04:38] <AlanHaggai> Is there any firewall that is already installed in Ubuntu?
[04:38] <Trainstroker> rblong2us: go to synaptic, settings,repositories, add,  (custom) (optional)
[04:38] <Pelo> AlanHaggai,  firestarter
[04:38] <ArrenLex> jstew: no, it wouldn't o_O my /bin/sh points to dash, and yet my shell is bash.
[04:38] <ArrenLex> Go figure.
[04:38] <Madpilot> CientificoLoco, you've already had an answer to that question - several answers, in fact...
[04:38] <AlanHaggai> Pelo : How do I configure it to open ports?
[04:39] <jstew> There must be a specific good reason that it's dash now and not bash like it was before
[04:39] <CientificoLoco> ArrenLex, where I did not see the answer
[04:39] <ArrenLex> AlanHaggai: yes. iptables.
[04:39] <Pelo> AlanHaggai,  no clue
[04:39] <ArrenLex> CientificoLoco: then search for your own name and scroll up, if you want the answer.
[04:39] <craigermendel> I am completely new to Ubuntu.  It took me an hour to figure out how to get this chat program installed.  Is there anyone who can help me uninstall firefox 1.? and install firefox 2 using GNOME as the GUI?
[04:39] <AlanHaggai> Pelo : no problem
[04:39] <John64> So no one knows what has changed for make-kpkg in Edgy because of Ustart?  Does upstart just use an InitRD Flag like it used to?
[04:39] <AlanHaggai> ArrenLex : How do I open ports in it?
[04:40] <Madpilot> craigermendel, which version of Ubuntu are you running? Firefox 2 is available by default in the latest, and there are always chat programs installed by default
[04:40] <ArrenLex> AlanHaggai: I don't know; I haven't worked with iptables. Perhaps the great wikipedia knows?
[04:40] <jstew> well here goes. I'll probably change the symlink to dash again when I'm done cause I'm a wimp that way :)
[04:40] <CientificoLoco> ArrenLex,  what is mercury ? is not a answer
[04:40] <AlanHaggai> ok ArrenLex :)
[04:40] <Trainstroker> E: mozilla-browser: subprocess post-installation script killed by signal (Illegal instruction)
[04:41] <ArrenLex> CientificoLoco: No, that is not an answer. That was a question, which was answered by us, along with very much advice about how to INSTALL mercury.
[04:41] <craigermendel> I am using 6.06.  I was having problems getting the latest version installed.
[04:41] <Pelo> AlanHaggai,   this is for iptable  , another firewall   http://qtables.radom.org/
[04:41] <craigermendel> As for the chat that is preinstalled...not too intuitive.
[04:41] <rBlong2us> damn
[04:42] <Madpilot> craigermendel, you can upgrade 6.06 to the latest 6.10 w/o reinstalling - and for what it's worth, I agree with you about Gaim, the default chat client - I don't like it either, but it's there
[04:42] <rBlong2us> I have a huge issue with this screen is flikering maddly berserk
[04:42] <phpuser> alg pode me ajudar ? j tentei entrar no ubuntu-br mais no entra , preciso de uma ajuda

[04:42] <jrib> phpuser: tambem podes ir ao #ubuntu-pt para portugues
[04:42] <CientificoLoco> ArrenLex, realy I can not see it
[04:42] <craigermendel> to Firefox 2 that is...
[04:42] <rBlong2us> anyone with damn sis drivers?
[04:42] <chad> rBlong2us: maybe change refresh rate?
[04:43] <jordan> craigermendel: What version of Ubuntu are you running, Dapper?
[04:43] <phpuser> me da uma fora ai,
[04:43] <craigermendel> yupper...Dapper it is
[04:44] <rBlong2us> chad: I have the same refresh time as PuppyOS, it was working fine with PuppyOS but with Ubuntu flickers insanely
[04:44] <Madpilot> !upgrade | craigermendel

[04:44] <caonex> I used to use the stock ticker in ubuntu 6.06 LTS, but now in edgy there seems to be an error with the application. It is shown a shaded area, anybody knows how to fix this? In this area the quotes used to display in scroll mode, now it is just gray
[04:44] <ArrenLex> Pelo: naw, no worries; I've said multiple times that I hate Ubuntu and I'm still here =P
[04:45] <Pelo> :-)
[04:45] <AlanHaggai> thanks Pelo :)
[04:45] <jordan> Madpilot: He wants to upgrade Firefox, not Dapper.
[04:45] <reiki> Pelo: on Edgy?
[04:45] <CientificoLoco> ArrenLex, help me to search it pleasE?
[04:45] <Madpilot> jordan, upgrading to Edgy will also get him FF2

[04:45] <ArrenLex> CientificoLoco: you can handle your own freaking search. Don't be lazy.
[04:45] <beowulf-afk> downloading the live cd, havent burned an ISO image to cd with linux before, simple to do?
[04:45] <Pelo> reiki,  , right now yes,  not so impressed, it realy wasn'T worth the trouble
[04:45] <riddlebox> beowulf-afk, now how do I get the tv out to work, it used to always just work?
[04:46] <AlanHaggai> beowulf-afk : yes. very easy to burn
[04:46] <Madpilot> beowulf-afk, very. Just right-click on the ISO & select Burn To Disc, assuming you're in Ubuntu.
[04:46] <reiki> Pelo: I have edgy on hda1 and Dapper on sda1. Took me a couple days to get Edgy working. Clean install fixed it
[04:46] <beowulf-afk> using suse now but I got the idea
[04:46] <CientificoLoco> oh my god
[04:46] <CientificoLoco> !!
[04:46] <craigermendel> I am confused...the update page only appears to give instructions on how to upgrade Ubuntu but not a program running under ubuntu.
[04:46] <beowulf-afk> riddlebox, never used tv connections
[04:47] <CientificoLoco> really I am feeling like that, 'coz I can not see it I have reread it for four time all the chat and nothing
[04:47] <bashir> i am back, nividea driver still not working
[04:47] <Pelo> reiki,   I clean installed after a day of trying to get the update to work,  but on my hda1 hdd,   sda is for my xp install,  I need it for cad stuff
[04:47] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: It's not a good idea because of dependencies. Firefox in edgy will depend on my libraries in edgy, which will depend in turn onto other libraries, meaning you'll have to upgrade large bits.
[04:47] <beowulf-afk> CientificoLoco, did you see amsn in your searches?
[04:47] <jordan> craigermendel: Madpilot suggested upgrading to Edgy to get FF2, I am looking for a guide for you to get in in dapper
[04:47] <bashir> i tried both the legacy and non-legacy ones but neither worked for me
[04:47] <screechingcat> i have a lot of different fonts in my /usr/share/fonts dir but abiword doesn't seem to recognize most of them. how do i fix this ?
[04:47] <Pelo> beowulf-afk,  for iso burning use  gnomebaker
[04:47] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: you can try it, certainly... you'll need to add edgy repositories, pin your system to dapper, and run aptitude -t edgy install firefox
[04:47] <bashir> when i do nvidia-glx-config enable
[04:47] <bashir>  i get errors
[04:48] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, 4<beowulf-afk> CientificoLoco, look for AMSN??
[04:48] <screechingcat> jordan: ive written a guide like that
[04:48] <bashir> i have an fx 5200 so the legacy one should work
[04:48] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: i.e. add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy main
[04:48] <chad> rBlong2us: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  maybe that could help somwhat
[04:48] <riddlebox> bashir, is that a nvidia graphics card
[04:48] <reiki> Pelo: ahh... install Dapper onto the freespace on hda1 and you'll still be able to play with edgy. You may get something worked out and like it again :)
[04:48] <bashir> and i have gotten it to work in ubuntu dapper before, but this time i am in edgy with a fresh install
[04:48] <beowulf-afk> pelo, Im using kde, the burning app is K3B
[04:48] <craigermendel> yikes...I feel like I just landed in greece.  I am lost.  how do I add anything and where do I add it to?
[04:48] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: then add the following to /etc/apt/preferences:
[04:48] <ArrenLex> Package: *
[04:48] <ArrenLex> Pin: release a=dapper
[04:48] <ArrenLex> Pin-Priority: 1000
[04:48] <bashir> ya
[04:48] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: then run apt-get update.
[04:48] <rBlong2us> chad: thanks for the help I've did that a thousand times
[04:49] <ArrenLex> craigermendel: then aptitude -t edgy install firefox
[04:49] <bashir> GeForce FX 5200 	0x0320
[04:49] <screechingcat> craigermendel: just follow this guide - http://everythingelse.wordpress.com/2006/07/15/howto-install-firefox-20-bon-echo-in-ubuntu/
[04:49] <beowulf-afk> CientificoLoco, AMSN is a exact close of msn
[04:49] <reiki> I thought the fx series nVidia cards could use the nvidia drive on legacy
[04:49] <bashir> from the list of ones that need the legacy driver
[04:49] <beowulf-afk> clone
[04:49] <craigermendel> So I am typing all thins in terminal right?
[04:49] <reiki> s/not/on
[04:49] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, exact close??
[04:49] <beowulf-afk> exact clone
[04:50] <CientificoLoco> I remember I have installed amsn before and I did not like it
[04:50] <jordan> screechingcat: There isn't a .deb for it?
[04:50] <bashir> that one didnt work so i also tried the non-legacy one (they remove eachother) but it didnt work either
[04:50] <shini`> hey
[04:50] <beowulf-afk> I love it ... but we all have different tastes
[04:50] <Pelo> reiki, , it works ok now, it's just little things that bug me,  dapper was so effing great I was expecting too much from edgy,  and I hate that I can't get my themes to match anymore
[04:50] <shini`> what's a good irc client i can use? i'm using gaim right now and it's not that great for irc
[04:50] <screechingcat> jordan: you can http download it from the edgy repos thru ur browser
[04:51] <wastrel> shini`:  xchat
[04:51] <screechingcat> jordan: but this guide ive written does it pretty well
[04:51] <kitche> sini`: xchat
[04:51] <reiki> bashir: you install the nvidia driver and then edit the xorg.conf file to activate it?
[04:51] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, I will installed wit automatix2 ...
[04:51] <craigermendel> Thanks for the link with instructions!  Looks good.
[04:51] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, I will try it in this version, it's new
[04:51] <shini`> ok thanks
[04:51] <beowulf-afk> CientificoLoco, you will like it
[04:51] <bashir> oh the guide said ntohing about changing the xorg file
[04:51] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, I whish
[04:52] <bashir> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[04:52] <CientificoLoco> beowulf-afk, where are you from? from USA
[04:52] <beowulf-afk> in connecticut
[04:52] <Pelo> eww
[04:52] <bashir> i did do sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[04:52] <screechingcat> Pelo: saw 3 ?
[04:53] <jordan> Trainstroker: It looks like your dpkg is broken, this is kind of whishfull thinking but you could try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure dpkg
[04:53] <Pelo> screechingcat,  no,  a french flic called Calvair
[04:53] <screechingcat> Pelo: ahhh
[04:53] <screechingcat> jordan: lol
[04:54] <ArrenLex> Trainstroker: if dpkg fails on a preinst script, it's not broken; the package is broken.
[04:54] <bashir> any advice anyone?
[04:54] <Agent_bob> it seems i forget from one time to the next how sorry ubuntu really is.   </rant>   i'm trying to mount /dev/sda but there is no device node   (sda does not exist)    what do i have to modprobe to make that ?
[04:54] <CientificoLoco> ArrenLex, beowulf-afk see ya.I will see you later bye
[04:54] <reiki> ok... how do you cat /whatever to see what video driver is active in xorg.conf?
[04:54] <jordan> ArrenLex: He said he also had an error running: dpkg-reconfigure apt
[04:54] <kitche> Agent_bob you mount partitions not devices
[04:54] <beowulf-afk> take care
[04:55] <kitche> Agent_bob: mount /dev/sda1 is probably what you want
[04:55] <Agent_bob> kitche ok i know not to listen to you now.
[04:55] <ArrenLex> jordan: With or without sudo?
[04:55] <Agent_bob> anyone else ?
[04:55] <sundari> I have a serial HD, whose partion is accessible from root users, but not from the user name i created by default when installing ubuntu
[04:55] <jordan> ArrenLex: With sudo
[04:55] <rbil> Agent_bob:  you mount partitions
[04:55] <Agent_bob> rbil you do not
[04:56] <Agent_bob> you mount file systems.
=== Guest18 is now known as thevenin
[04:56] <Agent_bob> now anyone know what to modprobe to get the system to make sda device ?
[04:56] <kitche> Agent_bob that are on partitions /dev/sda is a device /dev/sda1 is the partition on the device which you mount
[04:56] <woo> .
[04:57] <Agent_bob> kitche grow up already.
[04:57] <jordan> ktiche: I don't that is what he was asking.
[04:57] <rbil> Agent_bob: sda devices are controlled by udev under Ubuntu
[04:57] <kitche> jordan: well I know you can't mount /dev/sda
[04:58] <Agent_bob> kitche you know nothing.
[04:58] <jordan> kitche: He was asking about modules, not mounting
[04:58] <Agent_bob> you think you know, but you are wrong.
[04:58] <reiki> everything in *nix is files systems :)
[04:58] <Agent_bob> reiki yes.
[04:58] <beowulf-afk> welp an hour 20 minutes left to DL @ 123 kbps so Im gonna go hit the sack, thanks every one for your help
[04:58] <kitche> jordan: is that why he said I m trying to mount /dev/sda but what must I modprobe to get that
[04:59] <Pelo> g'night beowulf-afk
[04:59] <woo> q
[04:59] <jordan> kitche: He never said that
[04:59] <woo> :q
[04:59] <draco79> anyone good with wireless and ubuntu
[04:59] <kitche> jordan: is that why it says 22:53 < Agent_bob> it seems i forget from one time to the next how sorry ubuntu really is.   </rant>   i'm trying to mount /dev/sda but there is no device node   (sda does not exist)    what do i have to modprobe to make that ?
[04:59] <jordan> !anyone
[04:59] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:59] <Pelo> !wireless > draco79
[05:00] <sundari> how do i get access to a sda3 ?
[05:00] <Pelo> do you have a 3rd partition on a sata drive ?
[05:00] <jordan> kitche: And if sda dose not exist, niether does sda1
[05:01] <kitche> jordan: sure it does I don't have a sda device but got bunch of sda1-10
[05:01] <knasman> Rhythmbox isn't sending tracks to last.fm. Anyone have a solution?
[05:01] <Lone> yo
[05:01] <jordan> kitche: Ok, mabe you'r right, I admit I hadn't seen his previous comment before you mentioned it.
[05:02] <Lone> i finally got fed up with all of windows's bullshit and whiped the drives... fresh installs of ubuntu are fun
[05:02] <sundari> some one help me get access to a partion on my drive
[05:02] <jordan> kitche: And I do have a /dev/sda
[05:02] <Agent_bob> kitche in the first place a partition is not needed only a filesystem.  you don't mount partitions you mount file systems.   in the second place many devices have file systems without having partitions.  i.e. floppy disks     usb cameras (like the one i'm working on) amoung other thing.   if you would stop being a stupid "know it all" and remember that you don't know every thing you might actually be able to help someone.
[05:03] <kitche> Agent_bob: you said /dev/sda not a usb camera
[05:03] <Agent_bob> jordan got any idea what needs modprobed to make the sda device/s ?
[05:03] <kitche> Agent_bob: and yes a floppy does have a partition on it
[05:03] <Brogan> alright...ive got a problem installing ubuntu on my system.  Every time i boot from the CD, it locks up before i ever get a chance to start the actual install.  any suggestions?
[05:04] <sethk> kitche, it can, but it doesn't always.  you can use a floppy with a partition, or without
[05:04] <rbil> Agent_bob: on my system udev handles the creation of sdax devices through hotboot.
[05:04] <Pelo> Brogan,  sounds like a bad cd
[05:04] <jordan> Agent_bob: No, sorry, I can look in my /etc/modules and see if anything looks reasonable.
[05:04] <Agent_bob> sethk hard disks also can have partitions or not.
[05:04] <Brogan> Pelo: Tried 3 diffrent copys, same problem
[05:04] <rbil> Agent_bob: what is it you're trying to mount?
[05:04] <sethk> Agent_bob, yes, that's true.
[05:04] <Pelo> Brogan, when does it lock up ?
[05:05] <Agent_bob> rbil dev/sda
[05:05] <sethk> Agent_bob, less common for a hard drive to be used without a partition table, but just as possible as with a floppy
[05:05] <kitche> hard disks usually have one partition on them at all times unless it's not formated
[05:05] <rbil> what is dev/sda?
[05:05] <Brogan> Pelo: Just as it starts to load the GUI off the bootable ISO
[05:05] <sethk> kitche, no, that's not true
[05:05] <Agent_bob> kitche or the file system is on the whole disk  without a partition.
[05:05] <reiki> Agent_bob, modprobe usb-ohci?
[05:05] <sethk> kitche, the partition table is optional.  unless it's a boot drive, then it's needed
[05:05] <Agent_bob> rbil in this case a camera
[05:06] <rBlong2us> I think my problem is about horizontal shit
[05:06] <Pelo> Brogan,  are you  using multiple vidoe cards or some other unusual hardware config ?
[05:06] <Agent_bob> sethk actually no... grub needs a partition but lilo doesnt.
[05:06] <jluthman> i'm using ubuntu 5.10 live cd - i'm trying to FTP a cd image to my ftp server on the lan, can anyone tell me how to use the ftp command 'put' correctly?  i tried typing put /stuff/cdimages/thatthing.iso but it said it doesn't exist
[05:06] <sethk> kitche, the partition table is just the first sector on the drive, there is nothing different about it from the hardware perspective.
[05:06] <sethk> Agent_bob, that's true
[05:06] <rbil> Agent_bob: then you'll need to look at udev-rules
[05:06] <sethk> Agent_bob, except
[05:06] <sethk> Agent_bob, if you install lilo, without a partition table, you'll clobber your file system
[05:06] <jluthman> i then tried to make that my local dir by: lcd /stuff/cdimages
[05:06] <sethk> Agent_bob, but other than that ...
[05:07] <jluthman> ..and that didn't work
[05:07] <kitche> sethk: I know how a partition table looks like I have actually looked at one on a boot drive and one not on a boot drive
[05:07] <Brogan> Pelo: only unusual thing on my system is the old AT Keyboard plug.  I got a copy of Kubuntu to install on the same system, but the HDD died, and havent been able to get Kubuntu or Ubuntu to load since
[05:07] <rBlong2us> I think I am going back to Bill Gates Software
[05:07] <SAM_theman> yo peeps
[05:07] <sethk> kitche, you can have a partition table on any drive.  but it isn't a requirement
[05:07] <jluthman> is there any gui ftp client that i can install?
[05:07] <Agent_bob> sethk not true.  i have another boxen with no partition and lilo boots it just fine
[05:07] <Pelo> Brogan,  check your hdd/cd connectors
[05:08] <sethk> Agent_bob, the problem isn't lilo, the problem is that lilo will write to the first sector of the disk, and if you have no partition table, that's your file system metablock
[05:08] <Pelo> Brogan,  and your bios settings to make sure everthing is recognised properly
[05:08] <Brogan> Pelo: Done...first thing i checked.. Im a PC tech
[05:08] <reiki> I think it's bed time. All this geek talk is making me sleepy :)
[05:08] <floydwilde> gftp
[05:08] <Brogan> Pelo, ditto to the bios
[05:08] <sethk> Agent_bob, unless it's not the boot drive
[05:08] <Agent_bob> sethk no there is still mbr
[05:08] <Pelo> Brogan,  and I am a noob,  I just start with the obvious and work my way from tehre
[05:08] <sethk> Agent_bob, no
[05:08] <rbil> Agent_bob: never saw that before
[05:08] <sethk> Agent_bob, the partition table is part of the mbr
[05:08] <rBlong2us> is there a way to switch from Kubuntu to Ubuntu /
[05:09] <rBlong2us> ?
[05:09] <sethk> Agent_bob, it's the last four groups of 16 bytes
[05:09] <Lone> what's the best/biggest p2p (read: illegal music downloading service) network/client for linux?
[05:09] <jluthman> rBlong2us, you can use the add/remove applications program...
[05:09] <Brogan> Pelo: heh, ive tried from the begining, and was hoping there was a deeper solution
[05:09] <jordan> rBlong2us: Yes.
[05:09] <Agent_bob> sethk all i know is mke2fs /dev/hda   then install on /dev/hda = /      and configure/run lilo  and it works fine.
[05:09] <BadKitty> Hey folks
[05:10] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  yes there is,  bascaly you load up the gnome stuff and boo that instead of kde,  look for a tutorial in the forum, I am sure there is one
[05:10] <rBlong2us> I wanna do it cleanly get rid of KDE completely
[05:10] <sethk> Agent_bob, no, it won't.  believe me, I've fixed enough machines for people who did that.
[05:10] <rbil> Agent_bob: and what does fdisk -l tell u?
[05:10] <rBlong2us> thanks HAIR, I will look into a guide
[05:10] <Agent_bob> sethk you're talking through your hat.  i have a running box up stairs with that setup.
[05:10] <jordan> rBlong2us: It is two commands if you are running Edgy and you installed via the alternate install CD
[05:10] <sethk> Agent_bob, I know you believe that, but it isn't so.
[05:11] <sethk> Agent_bob, you can prove that easily enough.  back up your first sectors, and then run lilo.
[05:11] <Agent_bob> i set it up.   don't call me a liar.   you weren't there.
[05:11] <Brogan> Pelo: Is there an installer that will do it all from the text interface instead of the GUI interface?
[05:11] <Pelo> Brogan,  there probably is, but the only thing that comes to mind is some hardware problem,   the cd is live so it should boot  ,  the only thing that could prevent it from loading up properly would be it not recognisins some essential hardware
[05:11] <sethk> Agent_bob, I'm not calling you a liar, I'm saying you are mistaken.
[05:11] <Agent_bob> i did mke2fs /dev/hda and installed there and lilo boots it.
[05:11] <rbil> Agent_bob: then you have a magical hard drive there ... a first in the industry
[05:11] <Pelo> Brogan, that I donT' know ,  search the ubuntu forum for cli installation
[05:11] <sethk> Agent_bob, lilo isn't booting from that disk then.  Not where the kernel is, where the actual boot code is.
[05:12] <Brogan> Pelo: CLI? gotcha
[05:12] <Agent_bob> it's the only hd in the box
[05:12] <sethk> Agent_bob, you can certainly boot from that sort of partition, but you can't put the boot code there.
[05:12] <Pelo> Brogan,   Command Line Interface
[05:12] <Brogan> Pelo: many thanks
[05:12] <sethk> Agent_bob, really, check the lilo code.  you'll see immediately what it does.  and, if that's your superblock, the results will be unfortunate.
[05:12] <Agent_bob> only file system on the hd  and only disk in the box.
[05:13] <Agent_bob> sethk and i have done this many times.  not just one time.
[05:13] <sethk> Agent_bob, I know you believe what you are saying, but I can't let you put that out here, because people will clobber their systems doing it.
[05:13] <sethk> Agent_bob, although, actually, nobody will really do it, so it's probably ok to leave it.
[05:14] <Brogan> Pelo: no worries man, im a newb with this linux stuff also, just tryin to learn :)
[05:14] <Agent_bob> sethk ok so you call me a liar.    fine.
[05:14] <sethk> ah, he's gone.
[05:14] <sethk> good
[05:14] <sizzam> a little testy there, isnt' he
[05:14] <sethk> well, sorry, but we can't be telling people to clobber their superblocks
[05:15] <Pelo> Brogan,  do you at least get to the txt menu at the beginning ?
[05:15] <rbil> Agent_bob: as I said before ... do a: fdisk -l  ... and come back and tell us what it displays. Might have to sudo first
[05:15] <jordan> sethk: Ironic argument given his previous argument with sethk :)
[05:15] <kitche> rbil: he left
[05:15] <Brogan> Pelo: yeah, that loads fine, and i can do everything from there, except once it gets past the loading screen, starts the install, and loads the gui, it locks up
[05:15] <Shaezsche> tried to copile the 18.1 kernel and when i booted it didnt recognize my nic!
[05:15] <rBlong2us> jordan: what does the alternate CD have? Is it better ?
[05:15] <draco79> ok for network adapters do i follow ifconfig or the network settings
[05:15] <rbil> hehe
[05:15] <francois> hi all, i need help installing regular nvidia drivers on a 686, anyone can help ?
[05:16] <Pelo> Brogan,  ahh,
[05:16] <rBlong2us> do  I have to reboot after a massive upgrade?
[05:16] <Pelo> Brogan,  does it ask you for the partition stuff ?
[05:16] <sethk> francois, no problem installing drivers built for 386 on a 686 box
[05:16] <rbil> kitche: maybe he's left to go and defrag his Sea drive?
[05:16] <Pelo> rBlong2us,  only after something involving kernel update usualy,  and if you don'T just yet you won'T get botthered
[05:16] <floydwilde> Brogan what are the specs
[05:16] <Brogan> Pelo: doesnt get that far :/ i get the orange background, and a mouse cursor, and it stops there
[05:16] <jordan> rBlong2us: No, it really only makes a difference in the case of dealing with the ubuntu-desktop package
[05:17] <Shaezsche> after i play games my frequency util seems screwy. It will only clock down one of the procs and then alternate between the two. the temps are really high because of this, i have to reboot to fix it.
[05:17] <Shaezsche> pwoernowd
[05:17] <rBlong2us> thanks
[05:17] <francois> sethk, so drivers for the 386 work on the 686 no problem ? it keeps installing the 386 kernal image with it, so i don't know what to do
[05:17] <Brogan> floydwilde: its crap lol...old P2 400, and about 512MB ram...not sure how much exactly, didnt pay taht much attention
[05:17] <Pelo> Brogan,  , which brings me back to hdd problems ,  nicked cable maybe ?
[05:18] <sethk> francois, must be a dependency there.  I just rebuilt the drivers against my running kernel.
[05:18] <Pelo> Brogan,  can you do the live cd stuff ?
[05:18] <sethk> francois, downloaded the package from the nvidia web site.
[05:18] <floydwilde> there is an alternate text mode install disk
[05:18] <Brogan> Pelo: changed the cables also, but it souldnt be the HDD at that point, its still booting from CD
[05:18] <sethk> francois, but that prevents you from updating your kernel, in the future, using the package manager
[05:18] <sethk> Brogan, usually the bios is smart enough to associate cdrom with an actual cdrom.
[05:19] <Pelo> Brogan, but when you start the installation, it looks for a hdd to partition and install to,  which is where you say you lock up
[05:19] <sethk> Brogan, rather than with a particular IDE master/slave/primary/secondary slot
[05:19] <heisgreg> Here is an odd question. Is there a way to move memory in the swap to main memory if there is space? I always seem to be using 50 - 50 of each.
[05:19] <francois> sethk, aaaahh, so if i get the stable package straight from the site i should be able to install it no prob without having the 386 kernel image also ? because that would be prime :)
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[05:19] <charle97> brogan, are trying to install edgy?
[05:19] <sethk> francois, right.  you need the header files for the kernel that is running.
[05:20] <Brogan> charle97: tryin to install 6.10, whatever its called
[05:20] <francois> sethk, ok, so 386 header files, and then regular drivers from nvidia website ? and i'm good to go ?
[05:20] <charle97> brogan, try something earlier
[05:20] <Pelo> Brogan,  6.10 is edgy for future ref
[05:20] <charle97> brogan, edgy may be too much for your machine
[05:20] <Brogan> Pelo: thanks, just looked it up lol
[05:20] <sethk> francois, headers are headers.  you build for 386, or 686, but the headers don't change (for the same kernel version, of course)
[05:21] <Brogan> charle97: sounds good...should i get dapper? or go even farther back?
[05:21] <floydwilde> try xubuntu on old hardware
[05:21] <charle97> brogan, are you using the alternate cd?
[05:21] <sethk> Brogan, try dapper.  use the most recent version that works.
[05:21] <sethk> Brogan, but try the text mode install first
[05:21] <sethk> Brogan, what charle97 said
[05:22] <BHSPitLappy> wishes
[05:22] <francois> sethk, ok now i'm all confused....if i'm running the 686 kernel, do i get the 386 or the 686 header files ? or am i getting the 386 header files because the drivers need 386 ?
[05:22] <Brogan> charle97: im using whatever is on ubuntu.com under the downloads section
[05:22] <bretzel> Hi again ... How to prevent logout window to be hidden in gnome when running xcompmgr ?
[05:22] <Pelo> it's late, spelling is way down the list
[05:22] <sethk> francois, same header files for the 386 and the 686 kernel.  the only difference is the contents of the .config file.
[05:22] <charle97> brogan, there's a difference between the desktop cd and the alternate
[05:23] <Pelo> Brogan,  do you use bittorrent ?   search for  ubuntu 6.06  and use that
[05:23] <sethk> francois, a particular kernel version has a set of source, and that source doesn't change
[05:23] <Brogan> charle97: the desktop is the bootable one correct? thats the one i use
[05:23] <sethk> francois, it can be built for 383, 686, ppc, whatever
[05:23] <charle97> brogan, they're both bootable
[05:23] <Brogan> pelo: cant stand bittorrent lol...im a usenetter
[05:23] <sethk> francois, binary package changes, of course, but the source doesn't, and the headers are part of the source
[05:23] <Pelo> Brogan,  ewwww
[05:23] <charle97> brogan, alternate cd is for the low end machines
[05:23] <Brogan> charle97: ok, is it ont he ubuntu site? or do i need to search for it?
[05:23] <francois> sethk, ok so 686 headers and then drivers, thank you very much
[05:24] <sethk> charle97, not only, sometimes for very new machines as well
[05:24] <sethk> francois, right
[05:24] <sethk> francois, headers should match the running kernel.
[05:24] <charle97> stethk, i know; i've used only the alternate for my machine
[05:24] <Brogan> charle97: i had the latest version of Kubuntu running on this machine, but i toasted the HDD, so had to replace it
[05:24] <BHSPitLappy> charle97, no, the alternate cd is for any machine the graphical installer just plain sucks on. (that's all machines, so you know!)
[05:24] <sethk> francois, I was just saying, if you install 386 headers, or 686 headers, you get the same files, but that isn't important.
[05:24] <Err_> if I use GParted to break up my partitions into a root, home, and swap, will the ubuntu setup with that in mind?
[05:25] <francois> sethk, ok just one more question, i'm debating updating to edgy eft.....are you running it ? should i do it ?
[05:25] <Arafangion> Howdy, can I put /var/apt/archives onto a samba share, and mount it in that spot on all my ubuntu machines?
[05:25] <Arafangion> As read/write, with no issues?
[05:25] <sethk> francois, no, I'm not running it yet, except on one test machine.
[05:25] <Pelo> g'night folks
[05:25] <charle97> francois, fresh install
[05:25] <sethk> francois, I'm conservative about updating, especially with a new release.
[05:25] <Brogan> pelo: night, thanks for the help
[05:25] <sethk> francois, wait a couple of weeks, let other people work the kinks out of it.  :)
[05:26] <wastrel> works fine for moi :] 
[05:26] <francois> sethk, hahahaha, awsome, thanks a lot
[05:26] <Arafangion> sethk: Heh, that's what I said when I was still running Potato :)
[05:26] <wastrel> potato eh
[05:26] <heisgreg> Arafangion, have you tried NFS?
[05:27] <Arafangion> heisgreg: Why do you suggest NFS?
[05:27] <chad> Is there some kind of "Virtual CD rom" for Ubuntu? kinda like alcohol120% / deamon tools... i know you can mount a iso in terminal..but that only creates a folder.. i need a virtual cd/dvd rom
[05:27] <heisgreg> You can mount that as a remote file system, much easier than a samba share
[05:28] <floydwilde> Yeah I need to setup an NFS share, I remember something about exports
[05:28] <sethk> chad, you can create an empty file the size of a cd, and use losetup to map it to a loopback device, and it will behave exactly like a drive
[05:28] <rbil> chad: do you want to mount an iso?
[05:28] <Arafangion> heisgreg: But I already run samba. ;)
[05:29] <sizzam> when i make a launcher, i no longer have the 'run in terminal' option.   how do i get that functionality?
[05:29] <heisgreg> Can samba be mounted? Isn't it just a shared folder?
[05:29] <chad> sethk: think you cold explain a littl on how to do that? im a lil new to linux still...pm if you want
[05:29] <Arafangion> heisgreg: Of course it can be mounted.
[05:30] <sethk> chad, use dd to create the empty file.  something like this:    dd if=/dev/zero of=filename bs=1024 count=500000
[05:30] <floydwilde> smbfs
[05:30] <sethk> chad, 500000 isn't the exact size, you have to divide the size of a cd by 1024.
[05:30] <sethk> chad, then:   losetup /dev/loop0 filename
[05:31] <sethk> chad, then, until you do losetup -d, /dev/loop0 is that chunk of file.
[05:31] <jordan> !nfs | floydwilde
[05:31] <ubotu> floydwilde: nfs is the network file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[05:31] <sethk> chad, that won't help if you want to do packet writing, or multi track, but for most things it will look like a drive.
[05:32] <floydwilde> thanks
[05:32] <chad> dd if=/dev/zero of=filename bs=1024 count=500000   "filname bs"  filname of dvd?
[05:32] <sethk> chad, that's how I create flash images, for example.
[05:32] <sethk> chad, filename is just any name you choose.  bs means block size.
[05:32] <sethk> chad, man dd will show you what if, of, bs, count mean
[05:34] <mabreaux> does any one know of an open source inventory program for ubuntu?
[05:34] <sizzam> is there a way to make a shortcut to launch xterm and have it automatically execute a command
[05:35] <sethk> sizzam, yes, there is a flag to xterm for that,  I believe.  I'll check
[05:35] <sizzam> sethk, nm, just found it,  its -e
[05:35] <sethk> sizzam, too fast for me.  :)
[05:36] <sizzam> sethk, there were like 1,000 different flags to sift through in the man page
[05:36] <sethk> sizzam, when you run an xterm, you are actually running it with -e /bin/sh    by default, if you don't provide any othe program name
[05:36] <chad> you have to divide the size of a cd by 1024. is that say.. 4698669056 (bytes)/1024 ?
[05:36] <sethk> sizzam, yes, all the standard x flags
[05:36] <sizzam> ahh, didnt know that
[05:36] <sethk> chad, right

[05:38] <james296> anyone here know what to do to prevent the latest version of Wine from showing up in the Update Manager so I can continue playing World of Warcraft?
[05:39] <sherdog> Hey all. I just rented af dedi box, and the smart admin chose french even though I made it clear to him, that I dont understand french. How do I change language?
[05:40] <Arafangion> james296: One can always /ignore/ the update manager.
[05:40] <sherdog> "edit /etc/environment" thats the part Im stuck with
[05:40] <james296> yes but I dont wanna have to put up w/ it tellin me I have ONE update available always
[05:41] <james296> I only want it to let me know when I get updates I should install
[05:42] <DarkMageZ> james296, you might beable to open synaptic package manager. search for wine and tell it to lock that package :)
[05:43] <Err_> when i run ubuntu off the live CD my wireless connection doesn't work, it has my ethernet card activated but my wireless unchecked in the networking setup, when i check the wireless it says it updates for 30 seconds but i still get no connection
[05:44] <riddlebox> man, I can get the boot screen and the shutdown screen to come up clear on my tv with the nvidia drivers but as soon as it starts gnome the screen goes blank?
[05:44] <james296> its not locking it for some reason....
[05:45] <tyler> Randomly today my x died, stating that xorg's nvidia was at 8776 and the nvidia module for the kernal was only 8774.
[05:46] <riddlebox> james296, the beta drivers dont seem to be locking it, but I have lost tvout pretty much all together
[05:46] <james296> so....what can I do?
[05:46] <tyler> Anyway to update nvidia kernal module to 8776 or downgrade the xorg nvidia to 8774?
[05:47] <chadswill> sethk: chad@nix-box:~$ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /home/chad/Torrentz/xxxxxxxxxx.iso  what now?
[05:47] <eegore> could someone tell me how to start a game server remotely so it still stays up when I close the terminal window

[05:48] <tyler> any way to update nvidia kernal module to 8776 or downgrade the xorg nvidia to 8774?

[06:01] <rbil> zmm: post your xorg.conf file here:     http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[06:01] <jordan> Tonren: Did you upgrade from dapper?
[06:01] <BHSPitLappy> Texas915, it comes in the update manager.
[06:01] <Tonren> craigermendel: The -c flag forces it to search for dist updates.
[06:01] <jessie> Texas915, by using update manager
[06:01] <wastrel> craigermendel:  the correct way to upgrade from dapper to edgy
[06:01] <Tonren> jordan: My upgrade just failed.
[06:02] <Texas915> ok

[06:08] <jessie> BHSPitLappy, the progress bar works in all the others, just not human

[06:10] <sizzam> zircx, im using the version from the vmware workstation installer

[06:10] <dragoon> except that i must reinstall nvidia beta drivers
[06:10] <claygucci> anyone here get an error about a .rar file having a password? when it doesn't
[06:10] <rbil> zmm: xorg.conf looks ok to me. mabye you can try running at a lower color depth? you can change DefaultDepth from 24 to 16 and try that.
[06:10] <claygucci> ?
[06:10] <claygucci> what is the bet rar/unrar app for gnome?
[06:10] <dragoon> every time i reboot cause i get x errors
[06:10] <jessie> craigermendel, just use the sudo command. if you want a root terminal, use alacart to add root terminal to system tools
[06:10] <zircx> sizzam, from the repo?
[06:10] <sizzam> claygucci, rar
[06:10] <zircx> workstation heh, not player?

[06:10] <Tonren> Huzzah!  Edgy broke everything.  :\
[06:10] <sizzam> zircx, right, workstation comes with player too.   i used the version from the repos before, its fine
[06:10] <rbil> zmm: you'll have to restart X after making change to xorg.conf. CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE will do that for you.
[06:11] <chadswill> sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /home/chad/Torrentz/xxxx.iso   what else do i need to do....to make a virtual cdrom/dvd?
[06:11] <zircx> sizzam, great

[06:11] <claygucci> sizzam,
[06:11] <dragoon> so how do i fix this?
[06:11] <zircx> dragoon, why do you have to install re-install nvidia drivers?
[06:11] <dragoon> anyone can help me please?
[06:11] <jessie> BHSPitLappy, the progress bar works in all the others, just not human, so any ideas?
[06:11] <Holylucifer> Hi Guys,
[06:11] <sizzam> claygucci: whats up?
[06:11] <dragoon> cause i get this error
[06:11] <zircx> oh, dragoon, you need to run your update..
[06:12] <zircx> your one kernel behind mate..
[06:12] <zircx> are you running on edgy?
[06:12] <dragoon> API mismatch nVidia kernel module has version 1.0-7184 but xmodeule has 1.0-9625
[06:12] <BHSPitLappy> jessie, not really, might want to check for artwork updates and/or reinstall the package
[06:12] <jordan> !rar | claygucci
[06:12] <ubotu> claygucci: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[06:12] <jessie> no offense zircx, but i think that saying mate is funny
[06:12] <dragoon> ?
[06:12] <claygucci> sizzam, i just downloaded 2 seperate .rar libraries, when i use rar, the one ubotu is speaking of both say it's pasword protected
[06:12] <zmm> rbil
[06:12] <claygucci> but i highly dought oit
[06:12] <Holylucifer> this vista update makes me lean towards linux, how quick does it take to get used to from useing windows to ubuntu, just a quick question i care about?
[06:12] <zircx> jessie, that's alright, most people do..
[06:12] <rbil> zmm: yes?
[06:12] <zircx> dragoon, are you running edgy?
[06:12] <dragoon> zircx?
[06:12] <jessie> BHSPitLappy, ill just find another theme to use.
[06:13] <dragoon> yeah edgy
[06:13] <claygucci> is there a prograb that can break the rar pasword?
[06:13] <g333k> !reinstall grub
[06:13] <zircx> ok, you need to run the update
[06:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about reinstall grub - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:13] <TGPO> Holylucifer, with kubuntu ... maybe a week
[06:13] <sizzam> claygucci: and you don't know the password for it?   the creator of the rar attached a password to it
[06:13] <dragoon> again?
[06:13] <g333k> !grub
[06:13] <dragoon> ok
[06:13] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:13] <zircx> try run sudo apt-get update
[06:13] <jessie> zircx, i'm glad you're cool with me teasing you. some people hate it.
[06:13] <zmm> rbil: i've changed the default depth to 16....still no options in screen ses....do I need to restart my os to see the effect.
[06:13] <zircx> well, when you add the repository for the nvidia drivers, it also updates the kernel
[06:13] <jordan> Holylucifer: It really depends
[06:13] <Holylucifer> im downloading the latest ubuntu don't know about kubuntu O_o,
[06:13] <Holylucifer> for pc
[06:13] <ubuntugrrrrr> ok so call me a complete noob.. so im now trying to install wine using "apt-get install wine" and its going fine until i get the message "errors encountered while processing:crystalcursors" what to do?
[06:13] <rbil> zmm: as I said you need to restart X. CTLR+ATL+BACKSPACE will do that for you.
[06:13] <dragoon> i did not add any nvidia repo
[06:13] <claygucci> sizzam, yeah in cases like that you need an app that can "break" the password
[06:14] <claygucci> sizzam, and that is what im asking about at this point
[06:14] <g333k> how to reinstall grub?
[06:14] <dragoon> i installed from script as i always do
[06:14] <Holylucifer> so ive read a bit about emulators to run windows games on linux
[06:14] <g333k> !recover grub
[06:14] <ubotu> recover: Undelete files on ext2 partitions. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.3c-10 (edgy), package size 15 kB, installed size 108 kB
[06:14] <g333k> !reinstall-grub
[06:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about reinstall-grub - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:14] <Texas915> Wow!!! ubuntu is easy to update and installl stuff
[06:14] <zircx> dragoon, ... argh hang on ..
[06:14] <jordan> !grub
[06:14] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:14] <Holylucifer> how many people work on ubuntu?
[06:14] <karlchena> many
[06:14] <Holylucifer> since its open source
[06:14] <Holylucifer> cool,
[06:15] <dragoon> nope no mupdates available
[06:15] <claygucci> Holylucifer, at least 10
[06:15] <sizzam> claygucci: good luck, that may be a pretty hard find
[06:15] <bidha2kbsd> hi i am using laetst ubuntu server .. sometime my eth1 becomes eth2..
[06:15] <bidha2kbsd> what the probs
[06:15] <Holylucifer> hahaha 10, really?
[06:15] <dragoon> API mismatch nVidia kernel module has version 1.0-7184 but xmodeule has 1.0-9625
[06:15] <claygucci> at least
[06:15] <zircx> dragoon, join ubuntu-xgl there is a BerylOnEdgy link... on the topic, follow those instructions and you'll be right mate
[06:15] <Holylucifer> not bad
[06:15] <dragoon> anyone have any ideas how to fix that?
[06:15] <zircx> lol @ myself and mate
[06:15] <dragoon> i went there but people were just being asses and not trying to help at all
[06:15] <claygucci> but its the frist african american linux distro
[06:16] <dragoon> very weird since usually they are very helpful
[06:16] <claygucci> which is why it's popular
[06:16] <zircx> dragoon, the install is real easy man ..
[06:16] <Texas915> is there a mythtv repo
[06:16] <zmm> rbil: it didn't work
[06:16] <zic> guys, is there anyway to download themes for gnome ?
[06:16] <dragoon> ugggjh
[06:16] <zircx> you don't need people to help you.. it's easy enough to do on your own.. you just need to add the dep to your source.lists and your away..
[06:16] <Holylucifer> one thing since ill be completely new to this since this distro is newbie friendly.. is hardware
[06:16] <zmm> rbil: as in i still dont see higher res
[06:16] <Holylucifer> i don't want to be without internet, i got one hd :0)
[06:16] <Texas915> is there a mythtv repo
[06:16] <dragoon> ok il review the process i've done it on my other pcs but this one is giving me troubles
[06:16] <rbil> zmm: sorry then I don't know how to fix the prob. I don't use ATI, so can't give you more help on this. Maybe someone else can.
[06:16] <zircx> trust me, I had the same problem...
[06:17] <TGPO> Holylucifer, you'll prolly have internet as soon as you boot the CD
[06:17] <zircx> the only thing is, when you install or update run it in synaptic.. not apt-get
[06:17] <Holylucifer> got nvidia so i have not got a problem with the gfx side
[06:17] <zircx> it faulters for some reason.. don't ask me why
[06:17] <Holylucifer> well my ethernet card is intergrated
[06:17] <Holylucifer> but the drivers that my internet works on uses windows which is default
[06:17] <zircx> ok bbl.. i forgot why i came in here.. oh that's right..
[06:17] <zircx> vmware
[06:17] <zmm> rbil: It might be due to ATI chipset....where from can i get help for ATI chipset for ubuntu
[06:18] <rbil> !ati | zmm
[06:18] <ubotu> zmm: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:18] <Holylucifer> forget ati with linux
[06:18] <TGPO> Holylucifer, forget windows drivers unless you HAVE to have wireless and you have a bcm chipset
[06:18] <TGPO> Holylucifer, linux is nice in that you drop it in and things just work
[06:19] <Holylucifer> im on windows right now
[06:19] <jordan> Holylucifer: I have never seen an integrated ethernet card that didn't work with ubuntu, wireless is less so though
[06:19] <Holylucifer> well im used to windows
[06:19] <Holylucifer> ;-)
[06:19] <TGPO> jordan, I have but that was on 2.4 kernel
[06:19] <Holylucifer> gonna have to burn this iso to a 700mb disc now
[06:20] <chadswill> dd if=/dev/zero of=filename bs=1024 count=4588544
[06:20] <chadswill> <chadswill>  sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /home/chad/Torrentz/xxxxx.iso    I was told to do this in order to make a virtual cd/dvd rom..but the guy, logged off... what do i need to do next?
[06:20] <Texas915> is there a mythtv repo
[06:20] <manfred22> irgendwie denke ich, dass ich das denken einstellen sollte
[06:20] <sizzam> chadswill: are you trying to mount an ISO?
[06:20] <jordan> Holylucifer: You can try out all your hardware from the CD, it boots to a complete Ubuntu system, which is a nice trick IMHO :)
[06:20] <manfred22> kurios!
[06:20] <Holylucifer> from windows jordan?
[06:21] <ubuntugrrrrr> problem while trying to process crystalcursors when installing wine using "apt-get install wine"
[06:21] <Kim^J> chadswill: I just did this: sudo mount -o loop from.iso /to/where/mount
[06:21] <TGPO> Holylucifer, no, just reboot with the cd in the drive
[06:21] <Holylucifer> k
[06:21] <jordan> Holylucifer: No, when you boot from the install CD
[06:21] <chadswill> yes..but that only gives you a folder
[06:21] <Texas915> this ubuntu rocks
[06:21] <Kim^J> chadswill: mkdir folder/to/be/placed/in
[06:21] <Holylucifer> windows vista , i use these computers for games, :0)
[06:22] <Kim^J> chadswill: What you mean?
[06:22] <jordan> TGPO: Is the CDrom drive the first boot device by default on most BIOS's?
[06:22] <Kim^J> Just a folder...
[06:22] <manfred22> how can i format c: in console???
[06:22] <Kim^J> manfred22: C: ? Are you serious?
[06:22] <Holylucifer> this direct x 10, is not gonna be compatible with dx 9 dx 8 basicly, the new games will only work on vista only
[06:22] <sizzam> lol
[06:22] <TGPO> jordan, all depends
[06:22] <chadswill> i want a fake cd/dvd rom..virtual ...like damin tools/alcohol 120

[06:22] <Kim^J> manfred22: There are NO C: in Linux.
[06:22] <Kim^J> Dowey: Use k3b
[06:22] <manfred22> funny.... there must be C:
[06:22] <jordan> manfred22: Ignore Kim^J , things are just a little different in Linux
[06:22] <Texas915> where can i find a free webhosting site
[06:23] <TGPO> Holylucifer, they are releasing DX9-L for DX10 compatablulity
[06:23] <manfred22> there is a C: in my computer!
[06:23] <sizzam> chadswill: the comman Kim^J gave you will do that
[06:23] <Holylucifer> ill use the burn iso to disc link on ubuntu website
[06:23] <Holylucifer> ;-)
[06:23] <manfred22> i had c: in windows!
[06:23] <jordan> manfred22: It isn't called C: in linux
[06:23] <Dowey> i have k3b but it can't detect my devices. i have a dvd burner and i can even watch dvds
[06:23] <Kim^J> manfred22: There's no such thing in Linux.
[06:23] <manfred22> jordan, oh
[06:23] <manfred22> how is it called?
[06:23] <bony> i have a problem with dbus and this prevents to load the window decorator correctly and even due to this i cant use some keyboard shortcuts. what is the problem and what is the solution for this?
[06:23] <Kim^J> manfred22: /
[06:23] <Kim^J> root
[06:23] <jordan> manfred22: /
[06:23] <manfred22> okay
[06:23] <Kim^J> jordan: Beat you.
[06:23] <Osh3635> hello, this is my first time here how can i get some help please ?
[06:23] <manfred22> how can i format root?
[06:24] <Kim^J> Osh3635: Ask the question.
[06:24] <Kim^J> manfred22: rm -fr /
[06:24] <TGPO> Osh3635, state your problem and wait around
[06:24] <manfred22> thanks, Kim^J
[06:24] <TGPO> NOOOOOO
[06:24] <chadswill> yes..that makes a folder with the files.. but it is not showing like a real cd rom... i need that in order to use that cd rom from vmware
[06:24] <jordan> !ask 0sh3635
[06:24] <Kim^J> manfred22: You DON'T wanna do that!!!
[06:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ask 0sh3635 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:24] <bony> when ever i log in to my account i get a window saying there was an error in gnome-settings-daemon and will try to restart in the next log ing
[06:24] <Dowey> i get an error reading "K3b did not find a suitable writer. You will only be able to create an image."
[06:24] <chadswill> for*
[06:24] <manfred22> Kim^J, it tells me it cant remove something
[06:24] <Osh3635> i was using ubuntu 6.06 with wireless working and when i upgraded to 6.10 it stopped working
[06:24] <Kim^J> chadswill: There's no such thing as a real cdrom.
[06:24] <Texas915> where can i find kaffine plugins
[06:24] <Kim^J> manfred22: Puhhh...
[06:25] <nalioth> manfred22: do not ask such things here, please
[06:25] <Kim^J> manfred22: Why do you wanna format root?
[06:25] <sizzam> chadswill: in VMWare, you can either point to the ISO file itself and tell it to use it as a CD rom, or you can point to the directory where you mount the ISO (using Kim's command) and it will use it as the cd rom
[06:25] <manfred22> i want to install new ubuntu version
[06:25] <Kim^J> manfred22: Ahh
[06:25] <wastrel> you can format in the installer
[06:25] <Kim^J> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[06:25] <Kim^J> Or above.
[06:25] <manfred22> no, i want a total fresh install ::
[06:25] <jordan> manfred22: You need to do that from the LiveCD then
[06:25] <TGPO> manfred you just edit you apt sources
[06:25] <wastrel> and 'rm' is not a format tool
[06:25] <nalioth> manfred22: the installer will do it for you
[06:26] <Kim^J> manfred22: Do it from the live CD then.
[06:26] <AlanHaggai> Where can I find the DNS of my connection?
[06:26] <sizzam> chadswill: my bad, you cant point it to a folder.   so just select the ISO file and it will use it as a CD ROM automatically for you
[06:26] <Kim^J> wastrel: ;)
[06:26] <manfred22> okay, thanks
[06:26] <TGPO> manfred22, then just drop the new CD in and tell it to use the whole drive
[06:26] <manfred22> i will try
[06:26] <Holylucifer> does ubuntu take advantage of live cd?
[06:26] <zic> guys, is there anyway to download themes for gnome ?
[06:26] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : Where can I find the DNS of my connection?
[06:26] <manfred22> does it work with alternate cd too?
[06:26] <nalioth> manfred22: it does.
[06:26] <zircx> erm repo's only got player... I'll run with it and see what happens though
[06:26] <jordan> Holylucifer: Yes
[06:26] <Holylucifer> k
[06:26] <manfred22> okay, thanks guys
[06:26] <[CG] MacrossFX> hey there guys.  i'm trying to setup a vent server in ubuntu 6.06 but when i try to run the ventrilo program i get a "cannot execute binary file" error.  what does this mean?
[06:26] <Kim^J> AlanHaggai: Search on your ISP homepage?
[06:26] <zic> !themes
[06:26] <ubotu> Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://kdelook.org - http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/58/ - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[06:26] <sizzam> zic:  you can get themes from sites like gnome-look.org.   you download a tar.gz file from the site and install it using the theme manager
[06:27] <AlanHaggai> Kim^J : not that. The DNS I am currently using. Where to find it?
[06:27] <Kim^J> [CG] MacrossFX: It cannot be executed?
[06:27] <Holylucifer> an nother question, does ubuntu need anti virus and fire wall XD?
[06:27] <zic> sizzam: ok thank you :)
[06:27] <bony> hey dose people in #ubuntu ever care about some questions posted in the channel
[06:27] <Kim^J> AlanHaggai: Aha.. ifconfig i think.
[06:27] <jordan> Holylucifer: But liveCD isn't an application, it is what Linux users call a CD you can boot from into a full system
[06:27] <TGPO> Holylucifer, nope
[06:27] <bony> or they don't know the answers?
[06:27] <bony> i have been around this channel for a long time along with gentoo i feel more comfortable in gentoo than ubuntu cause people at gentoo really understand the problem and give a solutions dosn't matter weather it works or not at least some one respond's to the querys
[06:27] <variant> Holylucifer: firewall yes, av no (unless your using it to filter traffic to a windows computer)
[06:27] <sizzam> bony:  we am care much
[06:27] <Holylucifer> thx for that jordan
[06:27] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  /etc/resolv.conf
[06:27] <AlanHaggai> ok
[06:27] <Holylucifer> linux for gameing not windows vista, :0)
[06:27] <nalioth> !offtopic
[06:28] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[06:28] <Kim^J> bony: NO FLAMING! GET LOST!
[06:28] <[CG] MacrossFX> Kim^J: is there any reason why it's doing this?  i'm a linux noob so i don't know how to fix it exactly
[06:28] <chadswill> thats the problem.. i cant use vmware cdrom/iso fuction for this ... i need a virtual cdrom...  ive done this in winxp...so it can be impossible to make a virtual cdrom in linux..heh
[06:28] <kroisis> does edgy's kde have a system-config-services app similar to the one kde has on fedora?
[06:28] <rbil> Holylucifer: if you are behind a NAT router you really don't even need a firewall
[06:28] <riddlebox> which is easier to deal with an ati card or a nvidia card as far as setting up  with ubuntu?
[06:28] <AlanHaggai> yes wastrel :) I got it
[06:28] <scamboy> what's up everubody???!!!
[06:28] <Shadowline> would someone on dapper msg me the contents of there /var/lib/synaptic/preferences file ?
[06:28] <TGPO> kroisis, yes
[06:28] <variant> chadswill: mount -o /path/to/file.iso /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:28] <nalioth> kroisis: join #kubuntu for your kde question,s if you wish
[06:28] <Kim^J> [CG] MacrossFX: There's something wrong with the binary file. Check out some forums for Vent or some IRC channels. Can't help you there. Sorry.
[06:29] <variant> chadswill: mount -o loop /path/to/file.iso /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:29] <bony> Kim^J, i am sorry if i really hearted you but i have faced some serious problems dude
[06:29] <kroisis> wilco, thanks
[06:29] <Kim^J> bony: Hit it then.
[06:29] <scamboy> !nvidea|riddlebox
[06:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidea - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:29] <dustin> hey i was wondering if there is any way to do animation with inkscape?

[06:29] <ubotu> riddlebox: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:29] <wheelswitch> is there any reason one couldnt ssh into a server, and then ssh back into their own ssh server running on the same computer they were working from?
[06:29] <sizzam> chadswill: doing it variant's way should get it to show up in that 'physical drive' dropdown in vmware
[06:29] <TGPO> !ssh
[06:29] <ubotu> ssh is the Secure SHell protocol (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto). Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows, which can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[06:29] <variant> wheelswitch: firewall, or original computer is not running sshd
[06:29] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : Is DNS already enabled?
[06:29] <Kim^J> wheelswitch: Why the hell do that?
[06:30] <wastrel> wheelswitch:  if there is a firewall or something preventing access back to the first system
[06:30] <scamboy> !edgy
[06:30] <wheelswitch> Kim^J:  to test if my ssh is working...
[06:30] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[06:30] <Kim^J> wheelswitch: Oh.
[06:30] <variant> wheelswitch: just make sure sshd is running on both boxes
[06:30] <jordan> wheelswitch: Not that I can think of.
[06:30] <chadswill> kk
[06:30] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  the system should automatically use the servers in /etc/resolv.conf to resolve DNS
[06:30] <sizzam> chadswill: let me know if that works, im curious
[06:30] <AlanHaggai> ok wastrel :)
[06:30] <wheelswitch> i guess it isnt working then :'(
[06:30] <wastrel> wheelswitch:  you can use ssh localhost
[06:30] <wastrel> to test if it's working.
[06:30] <jordan> Kim^J: Please try to be more polite.
[06:30] <wheelswitch> yeah that works
[06:30] <Kim^J> jordan: ok.
[06:30] <scamboy> does anyone here recommends me 2 upgrade to edgy???:-D
[06:30] <bony> i have a problem with dbus due to which the window decorator dosn't work properly and i can't even use some keyboard short cuts. i get a window when ever i log in to my user it says error running gnome-settings-daemon will try to restart in the next login
[06:31] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : recently, I am having trouble browsing. I think it's a DNS problem.
[06:31] <wastrel> wheelswitch:  do you have a router?
[06:31] <VigoFuse> Putty comes with the server install 6.10? Or did I read the website wrong,,,,
[06:31] <variant> wheelswitch: firewall then or sshd.conf only allows local ips
[06:31] <wheelswitch> but that doesnt test if ports etc are fowarded correctly etc etc
[06:31] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : Should I change the DNS?
[06:31] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  can you ping the address?
[06:31] <manfred22> scamboy, do rm -rf / and then use live cd to format root
[06:31] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : let me check
[06:31] <Holylucifer> http://youtube.com/watch?v=NrERPOBMO04
[06:31] <wastrel> manfred22:  never suggest someone use that rm command
[06:31] <Kim^J> Holylucifer: Offtopic.
[06:31] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : no :(
[06:31] <jordan> scamboy: DON'T RUN that command !
[06:31] <variant> scamboy: you dont need to rm /.. just do the upgrade
[06:32] <Holylucifer> its a 3dfx advert
[06:32] <nalioth> manfred22: please do not advise that
[06:32] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : so it is their problem. Right?
[06:32] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  can you ping the DNS servers in your /etc/resolv.conf ?
[06:32] <scamboy> manfred: ??
[06:32] <variant> manfred22: what if his home directory is on the same partition as / (ubuntu default) you would have him wipe it...
[06:32] <VigoFuse> http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10    <<<<great read
[06:32] <manfred22> nalioth, someone here told me to do that here!?!?
[06:32] <zic> how do i know if i have gdm or dtk ? lol
[06:32] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : no
[06:32] <manfred22> i dont know
[06:32] <TGPO> rm -rf /usr/manfred
[06:32] <wastrel> you need new DNS servers or maybe fix your network?  can you ping anywhere on the internet AlanHaggai ?
[06:32] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : yes
[06:32] <scamboy> jordan: i will download to archive, then instal rght??
[06:32] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : it's working
[06:32] <variant> zic: well, dtk doesnt exist so im guessing its gdm :)
[06:32] <wastrel> which?
[06:33] <zic> variant: maybe i typed wrong, yes I know that gdm exists
[06:33] <jordan> scamboy: Sorry, could you explain again what you are trying to do.
[06:33] <jordan> ?
[06:34] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : it seems my connection is having trouble
[06:34] <variant> zic: ps aux | grep gdm
[06:34] <scamboy> jordan:update 2 edgy
[06:34] <chadswill> mount: can't find /mnt/fakecdrom in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab    hm..cant get it to mount
[06:34] <thevenin> if i were wanting to downgrade edgy eft server to dapper drake server does anyone know of any good guides or anything
[06:34] <variant> chadswill: yeah, you need to mkdir /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:34] <jordan> scamboy: Are you trying to do a fresh install or an upgrade?
[06:34] <variant> chadswill: or use whatever dir you like
[06:34] <thevenin> or would it just be easier to reinstall
[06:35] <scamboy> jordan: upgrade
[06:35] <variant> chadswill: /mnt on its own is acceptable
[06:35] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : when I download, the speed is ok. But when I browse, it is very slow and sometimes am not able to browse. So, what might be the problem?
[06:35] <jordan> thevenin: It would be easier to reinstall.
[06:35] <nalioth> thevenin: back up your home directory and reinstall
[06:35] <zic> variant: when it's /usr/sbin/gdm this means that i have gdm ?
[06:35] <shini`> is anyone using the new ubuntu
[06:35] <shini`> edgy
[06:35] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  are you downloading with bittorrent or other p2p ?  your upstream may be saturated
[06:35] <variant> zic: yup
[06:35] <steamer> yep
[06:35] <variant> shini`: me, its nice
[06:35] <jordan> scamboy: Just run: gksu "update-manager -c"
[06:35] <zic> variant: tanks
[06:35] <zic> variant: thanks
[06:35] <variant> zic: elcome
[06:35] <shini`> variant,
[06:35] <shini`> oops
[06:35] <shini`> variant, what are some pros to swtiching?
[06:35] <zic> variant: hehe
[06:35] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : I just use the browser download
[06:35] <scamboy> shini: planning..but its a risk to upgrade..
[06:35] <VigoFuse> thevenin: I just read and posted a well written Egey site
[06:36] <variant> shini`: it's nicer looking.. firefox2 aiglx..
[06:36] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : when I browse, the connection is absolutely free
[06:36] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  it does sound like you may have DNS problems - your dns servers may be slow in responding
[06:36] <variant> shini`: less stable (apparantly although i never had an issue) less support
[06:36] <shini`> variant, i have it downloaded but I donno if i want to do it yet -- do you use vim?
[06:36] <thevenin> VigoFuse, ok sweet would you happen to have a link by any chance, if not it is fine
[06:36] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : when I pinged, I got 33ms and all
[06:36] <variant> shini`: emacs
[06:36] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : is it ok?
[06:36] <scamboy> hmn, is firefox 2 can be manualy download for windows??
[06:36] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  what about the host command    host www.example.com     for example, does it reply quickly?
[06:36] <manfred22> yes
[06:36] <variant> scamboy: yes firefox2 can be downloaded for windows...
[06:37] <Mitrovarr> I need some help setting up a dual boot ubuntu/windows xp system.  Both OSs are already installed, one on one hard disk, the other on the other.  For obscure hardware reasons the windows drive has to be hda.  Any idea how i should set up the bootloader?
[06:37] <VigoFuse> thevenikn: http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10
[06:37] <scamboy> variant: beta???
[06:37] <shini`> variant, oh. hmm... see I tried testing it from a bootable cd and i wasn't sure if it was just the CD or not but the syntax highlighting wasn't working in the new vim
[06:37] <thevenin> thanks
[06:37] <variant> scamboy: why are you asking here --> #windows
[06:37] <shini`> lol
[06:37] <chadswill> chad@nix-box:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:37] <chadswill> chad@nix-box:~$ sudo mount -o /home/chad/Torrentz/xxxxx.iso /mnt/fakecdrom

[06:37] <sizzam> scamboy: firefox 2 went live last week, no longer in beta
[06:37] <Mitrovarr> thanks, i'll check that out
[06:37] <wastrel> shini`:  the new vim is vim-basic by default, you should install vim-full
[06:37] <variant> chadswill: i told you what to do 3 times now
[06:37] <variant> chadswill: i told you what to do 3 times now
[06:37] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : I tried host www.google.com. At first it replied immediately. But when I tried again, it didn't
[06:38] <nalioth> cherubiel: plesae don't paste
[06:38] <shini`> wastrel, oooooh so by installing vim-full i would get those features?
[06:38] <VigoFuse> My plasure, it is an extremley well written step by step
[06:38] <Mitrovarr> I was trying to get the old linux.bin system going, but I wasn't able to.
[06:38] <variant> chadswill: mkdir /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:38] <wastrel> shini`:  yes, syntax hilighting and stuff :] 
[06:38] <shini`> wastrel, vim, ftw!
[06:38] <thevenin> VigoFuse, that page is how to install the perfect server in edgy eft, i have read it good article but dosnt mention anything about downgrading
[06:38] <sizzam> chadswill: why aren't you able to point vmware to the ISO?
[06:39] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : I tried host www.google.com. At first it replied immediately. But when I tried again, it didn't
[06:39] <variant> thevenin: why would it? if it is perfect setup :)
[06:39] <shini`> wastrel, is that the exact package name, and is it available from the repositories do you know?
[06:39] <lnxkde> monodevelop is working on ubuntu edgy>
[06:39] <thevenin> didnt you notice what i was askin to do though
[06:39] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  maybe try different DNS servers if you can.  It seems like they are not responding well
[06:39] <wastrel> !info vim-full
[06:39] <ubotu> vim-full: Vi IMproved - enhanced vi editor - full fledged version. In component universe, is extra. Version 1:7.0-035+1ubuntu5 (edgy), package size 913 kB, installed size 1860 kB
[06:39] <shini`> <33
[06:40] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : which DNS should I try. I have specified both the numbers that my ISP has given
[06:40] <VigoFuse> Oh, my apologies, tgo downgrade toast,unistall old, install what you wanted, or that is what I was taught.
[06:40] <Mitrovarr> jordan:  I need to fix an already installed system, not install a new one... is there a different guide for that?
[06:40] <shini`> ubotu, thanks
[06:40] <ubotu> Thanks for the help!
[06:40] <scamboy> !find vim-full
[06:40] <ubotu> Found: vim-full
[06:40] <shini`> er
[06:40] <shini`> bot :)
[06:40] <thevenin> yes i want to downgrade
[06:40] <variant> !downgrade
[06:40] <ubotu> Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[06:40] <shini`> is the new vim on the dapper repos?
[06:40] <wastrel> AlanHaggai:  call your ISP :]    i don't know any public dnsmachines.
[06:40] <thevenin> was hoping it would be easier/quicker to do it from edgy eft and not just reinstall
[06:40] <thevenin> thanks
[06:40] <wastrel> vim in dapper is full version by default i believe.
[06:40] <thevenin> damn
[06:40] <Mitrovarr> jordan:  The computer used to be pure ubuntu, but now it's going to be ubuntu/winxp with winxp being on another drive I'm adding (which will change the ubuntu drive to hdb)
[06:40] <variant> !downgrade | thevenin
[06:40] <ubotu> thevenin: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[06:40] <wastrel> dunno about 'new'
[06:41] <shini`> yeah i'm running dapper now with vim 6.xx
[06:41] <VigoFuse> Download what you want now, then look up the Unistall/Remove thingy, then downgrade
[06:41] <AlanHaggai> wastrel : thanks. Also I would like to know if it is Ubuntu's DNS (cache) or something else (I don't know) causing the problem?
[06:41] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: Microsoft's DNS servers are 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3
[06:41] <scamboy> !upgrade
[06:41] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[06:41] <shini`> wastrel, vim 7 has bracket matching :)
[06:41] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: they usually work fine
[06:41] <wastrel> shini`:  it sure does :q
[06:41] <AlanHaggai> thanks sizzam :)
[06:41] <sizzam> no problem
[06:41] <AlanHaggai> thanks wastrel :)
[06:42] <jordan> Mitrovarr: Ok, the only thing you may need to do it reconfigure grub.
[06:42] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: or Earthlink DNS - 207.69.188.185 and 207.69.188.186
[06:42] <AlanHaggai> thanks :)
[06:42] <Mitrovarr> jordan: the problem is that with the windows drive in, I can't boot into linux.  Without it, I can't install the bootloader (also I don't know if they fixed this but putting grub on used to break winxp)
[06:42] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : should I need to restart my connection so that this changed DNS will be used?
[06:43] <chadswill> sigh..dont see what im am doing wrong, variant :/
[06:43] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: i think you might have to stop and start it, but im not sure on that one
[06:43] <cherubiel> !grub | Mitrovarr
[06:43] <ubotu> Mitrovarr: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:43] <VigoFuse> I am on a Windows based ISP, so far the tek says NO LINUX, I hope to prove him wrong./g
[06:43] <Mitrovarr> ah, there we go
[06:43] <AlanHaggai> ok sizzam :)
[06:43] <jordan> Mitrovarr: Using grub should not break windows.
[06:43] <bony> there is a problem with mysql-server-5.0 it simply refuses to start, there is a but report filed on this topic. is there any other alternative for time being till the bug is fixed?
[06:43] <Mitrovarr> it sure used to
[06:43] <bony> oops its bug report not but report
[06:44] <Mitrovarr> used to be that windows bootloader absolutely had to be on the mbr of the first hard drive
[06:44] <nalioth> bony: ask in #mysql for possibly better info
[06:44] <bony> nalioth, its a ubuntu specific problem cause when i upgrade my system from dapper to edgy i got this problem
[06:45] <shini`> time for bed, night all
[06:45] <bony> nalioth, and even in ubuntu its E64 specific
[06:45] <jordan> Mitrovarr: I don't use windows, but I don't think that is the case anymore.
[06:45] <Mitrovarr> jordan:  alright, I'll try just using grub.  If it breaks windows I know how to fix that already
[06:45] <Dowey> ya i still can't burn with k3b it says it cant find a suitable device
[06:45] <Mitrovarr> jordan:  Thanks!
[06:46] <Lone> does anybody a good and big p2p network (read: illegal music downloading service) for linux?
[06:46] <sizzam> Lone:  i think some people use Frostwire, which is a Limewire clone
[06:46] <nalioth> Lone: we don't condone illegal activities here
[06:46] <chadswill> i did sudo mkdir /mnt/fakecdrom      and      sudo mount -o /home/chad/Torrentz/xxxxx.iso /mnt/fakecdrom
[06:46] <nalioth> sizzam: ^^^
[06:46] <sizzam> nalioth: got it
[06:47] <MrObvious> I need a newer version of gettext.
[06:47] <MrObvious> I'm trying to compile E17 and it needs at least 14.6
[06:47] <sizzam> chadswill: why can't you just choose the ISO in vmware, what happens?
[06:47] <MrObvious> (Dapper only comes with 14.5)
[06:47] <seshomaru123> hi , i intstalled easycam2 today and since then i cannot use synaptic ,apt or aptitude, it keeps saying that another application is running even after i log out and in
[06:48] <_paulb> dhcpd will not start how do i figure out the problem?
[06:49] <Dowey> how can i get k3b to find the burning device it needs
[06:49] <jordan> seshomaru123: Is dpkg running?
[06:49] <VigoFuse> May try to install tonight, still ifish cause of the warranty thing.
[06:50] <seshomaru123> jordan, i dont think so , i just logged out and in and still get the same message
[06:51] <_paulb> how would i check the error output for dhcpd not starting?
[06:51] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : still there is a small problem while resolving names :(
[06:51] <jordan> seshomaru123: Check with: pgrep dpkg
[06:51] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: what address are you trying to get to
[06:51] <nalioth> seshomaru123: ps aux|grep [dpkg|apt-get] 
[06:52] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : I tried www.cmyip.com
[06:52] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : At first it took time to resolve. But the next time, it was fast
[06:52] <jordan> nalioth: pgrep is easier to type ;)
[06:52] <Dowey> when i try to mound my cd drive another error "mount: special device /dev/hdd does not exist
[06:52] <Dowey> "
[06:52] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: same for me, i just did ping www.cmyip.com,   it paused for like 5 seconds, then started returning
[06:53] <MrObvious> How can I get a new version of gettext than 0.14.5? Do I need to compile from the source?
[06:53] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : maybe it's cmyip.com's problem
[06:53] <scamboy> !edgyfinal
[06:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about edgyfinal - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:53] <sizzam> AlanHaggai:   ping www.yahoo.com    should be instant
[06:53] <jordan> scamboy: Edgy is already final.
[06:53] <manfred22> where to find irc proxy??

[06:54] <manfred22> where to find irc proxy??

[06:54] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : fast. But taking 333ms or so time
[06:54] <wastrel> MrObvious:  i imagine it is possible but i don't know how.
[06:54] <MrObvious> E17 requires 0.14.6 now
[06:55] <scamboy> jordan: i am afraid to upgrade...coz if anything goes WRONG...my windows will also be effected....
[06:55] <MrObvious> I could compile from source but I don't know if that's a good idea with deb management.
[06:55] <seshomaru123> jordan , dpkg and apt-get are not running
[06:55] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: mine take about 31ms each
[06:55] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : why much delay for me?
[06:55] <jordan> scamboy: There is verry little chance that upgrading will break windows.
[06:56] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: not sure, you can try tracepath www.yahoo.com
[06:56] <scamboy> jordan: but will break grub>:o
[06:56] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: that shows you the times for each hop along the way
[06:56] <MrObvious> Is there a way to compile a deb from source?
[06:56] <AlanHaggai> ok sizzam
[06:56] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: keep in mind that many web servers don't allow pings at all
[06:56] <Dowey> it seems like my computer cant detect any sort of burner
[06:56] <wastrel> tracepath eh
[06:56] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : oh I see
[06:56] <nalioth> !tell MrObvious about checkinstall
[06:56] <wastrel> what happened to traceroute
[06:56] <c_lisp> beryl owns
[06:57] <sizzam> wastrel: thats what I was looking for,  i have traceroute6
[06:57] <sizzam> wastrel: but no traceroute or tracert
[06:57] <rihui> hi
[06:57] <jordan> scamboy: If it does, you can use the Ubuntu liveCD to restor grub, or the windows install CD to restore the windows bootloader.
[06:57] <Dowey> what is trace path
[06:57] <sizzam> i think its a traceroute utility
[06:58] <scamboy> jordan: is it??? ubuntu use LIVECD laa..ok....i will update in 3 hours....wish me luck...willll be backk......
[06:58] <jordan> scamboy: wait, one thing
[07:00] <jordan> scamboy: A lot of tuturials wrongly say to upgrade by changing your sources.list, don't. to upgrade run: gksu "update-manager -c"
[07:01] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : my browser mostly waits at 'waiting for reply'
[07:01] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: what kind of internet connection do you have?
[07:01] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : only after some time does it transfer the data
[07:01] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : DSL
[07:01] <AlanHaggai> 256 kbps
[07:02] <manfred22> damn small linux is cool
[07:02] <manfred22> it starts out of win!!
[07:02] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : it was all ok till last week
[07:02] <jordan> AlanHaggai: Does ping work at normall speed?
[07:02] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: have you reported the problem to your phone company?
[07:02] <rihui> hi
[07:02] <sizzam> jordan: his pings are taking like 300ms each for yahoo
[07:02] <rihui> i have a question
[07:02] <AlanHaggai> no jordan, the ping is slow
[07:02] <rihui> how do i enter console, without starting x
[07:03] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : I haven't phoned them yet. I wanted to make sure that my side and my PC is correct
[07:03] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : what do you say?
[07:03] <rihui> i need to install something through console, and x cannot be started
[07:03] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: I can't think of anything in your setup that would cause that
[07:04] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : so it is the problem with the ISP. Right?
[07:04] <scamboy> jordan: why??
[07:04] <sizzam> rihui:  control+alt+F1 will take you to a console
[07:04] <rihui> i know
[07:04] <rihui> but how do i kill x
[07:04] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: perhaps, maybe a line noise issue or something as well
[07:04] <rihui> the installer won't let me install when x is running
[07:04] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : I see :(
[07:04] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: have there been any storms or strong winds where you live?
[07:04] <nomad111> hey all i have ubuntu (gnome) and xubuntu how do i remove the xubuntu stuff
[07:04] <nomad111> ?
[07:05] <jordan> scamboy: dist-upgrading to Edgy will break your system, it is not the correct way to upgrade.
[07:05] <sizzam> nomad111: sudo apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop
[07:05] <Stoney47> evening yall, anyone here have any experience with 3dfx vid cards?
[07:05] <jordan> sizzam: I think that is just a meta-package.
[07:06] <manfred22> that is just a meta-package.
[07:06] <rihui> anybody can tell me how to start ubuntu with terminal only, without x r unning
[07:06] <sizzam> my bad
[07:06] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : there was heavy storm and lightning last week
[07:06] <nomad111> sizzam, it turned out to be autoremove
[07:06] <ixian_> isnt 'recovery mode' just the terminal?
[07:06] <factotum> rihui: might be able to change your runlevel at bootup
[07:06] <jordan> nomad111: sudo apt-get autoremove xubuntu-desktop ( if you are using Edgy )
[07:06] <sizzam> rihui:   are you able to do a ctrl+alt+f1 ?
[07:06] <nomad111> ye
[07:06] <nomad111> jordan, thx jordan
[07:06] <rihui> yes
[07:06] <jordan> nomad111: np
[07:07] <rihui> i get into a console when i pressed ctrl alt f1
[07:07] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: maybe they have you routed differently now due to the storm or something, who knows.   i would definitely report the issue to them though and go from there
[07:07] <rihui> but x is still running
[07:07] <rihui> isn't it?
[07:07] <sizzam> rihui: it is, what do you want to do from the console?
[07:07] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : I see. So, what should I call them and tell?
[07:07] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: that you are experiencing latency.  they'll start having you run tests from there
[07:07] <rihui> install binary drivers for nvidia
[07:08] <rihui> i use the driver from nvidia website
[07:08] <AlanHaggai> sizzam : what is latency?
[07:08] <sizzam> AlanHaggai: latency = slowness
[07:08] <jStefan> rihui, it's a lot easier to install the ones on the repositories
[07:08] <rihui> the driver in repository doesn't work
[07:08] <james296> WHY AM i UNABLE TO INSTALL ut 2004 USING THE LINUX INSTALLER ON THE cd???
[07:08] <rihui> at least for me
[07:08] <james296> sorry caps lock was enabled
[07:08] <jordan> AlanHaggai: Or more precicesly, lateness.
[07:08] <jStefan> rihui, you have to enable them after installing them
[07:08] <rihui> i know
[07:08] <rihui> i followed everything in the wiki
[07:08] <rihui> but it still don't work
[07:08] <rihui> lol
[07:09] <jStefan> rihui, do you get an error?
[07:09] <sizzam> i'd go with latency ;-)
[07:09] <AlanHaggai> thanks sizzam and jordan and wastrel for the amazing help rendered to this newbie. :) Lots of aprreciations :)
[07:09] <sizzam> 1) In a network, latency, a synonym for delay , is an expression of how much time it takes for a packet of data to get from one designated point to another.
[07:09] <rihui> yea

[07:17] <strav> hi there. I'm using a wireless connection from my college which use a password/username authentification. (I don't know which kind of key is used) From the network connection manager, I dont't have any field for user/passm where should I configure this (with iwconfig?)
[07:17] <GigaClon> most of that is done from a website
[07:18] <jordan> raxxerk: What interface is it?
[07:18] <GigaClon> just connect to the point then open a browser and see
[07:19] <raxxerk> realtek 8139

[07:20] <DavidtheAspie> Hi!
[07:20] <raxxerk> jordan, that will require authentication or i'm wrong?
[07:20] <lasindi_office> Hi everyone, I'm trying to set up an HP DeskJet 420 connected to the parallel port, and I'm using System->Administration->Printing in the menu to configure this. It isn't detected automatically, but I can get it half working by specifying LPT#1. If I try printing a test page, however, it will print gibberish.
[07:21] <jordan> raxxerk: Yes, that will ask you your password every time you log in.
[07:21] <lasindi_office> I'm also using a black and white cartridge, but my configuration on the color doesn't appear to matter
[07:21] <DavidtheAspie> I have a Sony Vaio VGN-FJ290 laptop with a QWERTY keyboard with 88 keys
[07:21] <lasindi_office> *in terms of it failing
[07:21] <progek> can someone please help me with tomcat? I installed it and started it. It gave me an 'OK' so I know tomcat is running. When I localhost:8080 I get a blank screen :/
[07:22] <jordan> raxxerk: Hence why it isn't an ideal solution.
[07:22] <raxxerk> jordan, thx for the trick
[07:22] <c_lisp> is there a program to record linux desktop session in a video?
[07:22] <DavidtheAspie> However, my keyboard settings are US International with Dead Keys

[07:22] <manfred22> do you think you are funny?
[07:25] <witless> am i the only one whose nvidia card was hosed by a recent update?
[07:25] <Abnerian> Ugh, I need help.
[07:25] <Abnerian> Badly.
[07:25] <wastrel> do tell
[07:25] <Abnerian> I am trying to install a LiveCD to my USB pen drive.
[07:25] <Abnerian> And I just can't manage.
[07:25] <Abnerian> I'm on Windows.
[07:25] <manfred22> do you think you are funny?
[07:26] <jordan> manfred22: Who?
[07:26] <manfred22> you?
[07:26] <wastrel> manfred22:  i crack the occasional joke
[07:26] <Abnerian> Can someone help me? I don't want a persistent install.
[07:26] <Abnerian> I just want a bootable USB stick.
[07:26] <Abnerian> I really don't care if I can save data to it
[07:26] <wastrel> Abnerian:  i sure don't know about usb pen drives but doesn't flash have a limited # of write cycles
[07:26] <Abnerian> it just needs to function exactly as a live CD
[07:26] <duane> has flash 9 beta been updated at all lately?
[07:27] <jordan> Abnerian: I am the guy who talked to you about that before :) looking for a link with windows instructions...
[07:27] <raxxerk> jordan, there is a way to postpone the command a few seconds after boot?
[07:27] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: i dont think that can be done with ubuntu
[07:27] <SiCuTDeUx> anyway
[07:27] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: better start looking for a distro ready for it
[07:27] <manfred22> do you think you are funny?
[07:27] <Abnerian> I want Ubuntu to go from USB --> HDD
[07:27] <jordan> raxxerk: Yes...
[07:27] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: like puppy linux or DSL
[07:28] <Abnerian> it's a two gig drive
[07:28] <witless> i installed the latest update and now X won't boot.  it says there is an nvidia kernel mismatch
[07:28] <Abnerian> I know Ubuntu is bootable from a USB drive
[07:28] <manfred22> no
[07:28] <manfred22> it isnt
[07:28] <DavidtheAspie> I have a Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection for my wireless connection.
[07:28] <Abnerian> the LiveCD is.
[07:28] <raxxerk> i mean adding a sort of sleep command
[07:28] <jordan> raxxerk:  gksu "sleep <insert time to wait in seconds here> &&ifdown -a && ifup -a"
[07:28] <DavidtheAspie> Is there a pre-compiled driver that i can install?
[07:28] <zugu> hello
[07:28] <Abnerian> Anyone? Anybody at all?
[07:29] <raxxerk> thx again jordan
[07:29] <jordan> Abnerian: I am the guy who talked to you about that before :) looking for a link with windows instructions...
[07:29] <BlueEagle> abnerian: Have you tried simply installing to the USB stick?
[07:29] <Abnerian> I'm not sure how, BlueEagle.
[07:29] <wastrel> DavidtheAspie:  ipw2200 should handle that
[07:29] <Madpilot> Abnerian, check help.ubuntu.com/community - there's an install from USBstick somewhere on there
[07:29] <Abnerian> I did, it's not helping.
[07:29] <zugu> I just installed the nvidia-glx-legacy drivers, but when I run  nvidia-glx-config enable it says: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[07:29] <zugu> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[07:29] <Abnerian> I'm utterly confused.
[07:29] <Abnerian> It's a bunch of BASH.
[07:29] <wastrel> DavidtheAspie:  i have that card works perfectly with default ubuntu kernel
[07:29] <Abnerian> Which I don't speak
[07:30] <BlueEagle> abnerian: the usb stick would be /dev/sda probably. However you might need the alternate install ISO to be able to specify such a device. Not sure if the livecd will allow it.
[07:30] <witless> zugu: i have the same thing, but not with legacy drivers.
[07:30] <Abnerian> I am on Windows.
[07:30] <BlueEagle> !enter
[07:30] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and can be annoying.
[07:30] <draco79> anyone good a wireless in here maybe some is came in this room that has not heard me yet
[07:30] <zugu> witless, it dries me nuts
[07:30] <DavidtheAspie> wastrel: I got that, but how do I compile it?
[07:30] <witless> zugu: just happened with the latest update
[07:30] <zugu> witless, same here
[07:30] <wastrel> DavidtheAspie:  are you running the default ubuntu kernel?
[07:30] <zugu> wastrel, yes, the generic one
[07:31] <zugu> i think
[07:31] <DavidtheAspie> wastrel:  Yes.
[07:31] <witless> zugu: this smells a lot like the SNAFU a couple months ago with the update that broke X
[07:31] <jordan> Abnerian: If you don't mind PClinux: http://pendrivelinux.com/2006/09/19/all-in-one-usb-pclinuxos-minimezip/ is the iesiest tutorial I have seen for windows, they have made it almost effortless.
[07:31] <wastrel> DavidtheAspie:  sudo modprobe ipw2200   should get it running, though i don't know why it wouldn't have been running already
[07:31] <Abnerian> But...I want Ubuntu.
[07:31] <Abnerian> i don't want this on my USB stick
[07:32] <Abnerian> I want it on my hard drive
[07:32] <Abnerian> but
[07:32] <Abnerian> The only way to get it there is with a USB stick
[07:32] <Abnerian> see?
[07:32] <zugu> witless, actually, this is afresh install; I installed ubuntu last night and had the same problem, now I have xubuntu and nothing changed :(
[07:32] <witless> hmm
[07:32] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: use a cd and install it
[07:32] <jordan> Abnerian: Ok, I remember now,
[07:32] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: like every one does
[07:32] <Abnerian> I can't
[07:32] <jordan> SiCuTDeUx: His drive is broken
[07:32] <Abnerian> I have two laptops
[07:32] <SiCuTDeUx> oh ok.
[07:32] <Abnerian> Neither have optical drives
[07:33] <SiCuTDeUx> oh that sux
[07:33] <iami89> i have a question
[07:33] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: may be googling arround
[07:33] <iami89> what is root password
[07:33] <draco79> now what is googling and the forums are no help
[07:34] <wastrel> Abnerian:  i recommend you become familiar enough with the command line to follow the instructions given - i doubt there's an easier way as this is a rather esoteric requiest
[07:34] <wastrel> !cli
[07:34] <ubotu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Manuals: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicCommands
[07:34] <Abnerian> i am on windows
[07:34] <zugu> witless, I have seen many people on the forums with the same problem, and everyone told them to manually replace "nv" with "nvidia" in xorg.conf, but doing that last night rendered my X useless
[07:34] <iami89> i've try follow the guide but no pass or user pass is not work
[07:34] <Abnerian> I have a single windows PC. I have no optical drives.
[07:34] <wastrel> !root | iami89

[07:34] <Abnerian> I have just windows and a USB drive.
[07:34] <Abnerian> JUST.
[07:34] <Abnerian> I cannot get any more equipment.
[07:35] <wastrel> Abnerian:  visit your local linux user group for help?
[07:35] <Abnerian> There is none.
[07:35] <Abnerian> I am in a rural area.
[07:35] <SiCuTDeUx> Abnerian: maybe this will help

[07:35] <zugu> I think I'll go for Dapper again, Edgy is too painless for me
[07:35] <witless> iami89: there is none - use sudo su
[07:35] <zugu> *painful
[07:35] <zugu> :)
[07:35] <wastrel> witless sudo -i  is better
[07:35] <iami89> can i add a other driver for ubuntu?

[07:45] <Trentster> Hey all, I am using Ubuntu 6.10 with a core 2 duo system that unfortunately has the horribly supported JMicron controller, system was erratically unstable until I switched off jmicron in the bios, and now things are running super smoothly. I heard with kernel 2.6.19 there will be proper JMicron support, any ideas when this will be or if there is an interim solution?
[07:46] <wastrel> !cn | iami89
[07:46] <ubotu> iami89: For Ubuntu help in Chinese  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[07:47] <SiCuTDeUx> Trentster: compile your own kernel without JMicron support
[07:47] <witless> this console interface really shows off ubuntu nicely
[07:47] <seeking2> jordan: ok! I added seveas sources!  now i update and install new flash9?
[07:47] <SiCuTDeUx> maybe that would help a bit
[07:47] <jordan> seeking2: Yup.
[07:47] <seeking2> jordan: ok cheers big ears ;)
[07:47] <thyko> SiCuTDeUx: thanks
[07:47] <seeking2> jordan: what else can I download from seveas?
[07:48] <SiCuTDeUx> thyko: no, thank u for asking.
[07:48] <Trentster> SiCuTDeUx, what for? I allready dont have CDrom support as its dissabled in the kernel.
[07:48] <Trentster> I mean in the bios.
[07:48] <SiCuTDeUx> Trentster: oh... i wast just guessing :P
[07:48] <jordan> seeking2: I don't know.
[07:48] <SiCuTDeUx> Trentster: :P
[07:48] <seeking2> jordan: do I ever have to defrag my hard drive?
[07:48] <wastrel> no defrag on linux
[07:48] <jordan> seeking2: No
[07:48] <seeking2> wastrel: how come?
[07:49] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: there is no need to defrag
[07:49] <jordan> seeking2: Ext3 > ntfs
[07:49] <SiCuTDeUx> reiserfs > Ext3
[07:49] <seeking2> why do ppl use windows anyway when Linux is so good, eg, no defrag, spyware etc?
[07:49] <jordan> seeking2: The file system Ubuntu uses doesn't fragment
[07:49] <myJuly1423> is imposible
[07:49] <seeking2> SiCuTDeUx: I use ext3!  should i be using reiserfs?
[07:49] <jordan> seeking2: Hardware support, familiarity, that one windows app...
[07:49] <seeking2> jordan: thats awesome! so ext3 is that good?
[07:50] <myJuly1423> always will be fragments
[07:50] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: no, that's a more complicated solution...
[07:50] <seeking2> jordan: ok
[07:50] <jordan> myJuly1423: But not practical problems for regular users
[07:50] <iami89> how can i convert NTFS driver to EXT3?
[07:51] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: i use it because im a nut! :P
[07:51] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: Ext3 r0x too
[07:51] <jordan> iami89: You can't really, all you can do is copy the files from one to another
[07:51] <seeking2> SiCuTDeUx: ok :)
[07:51] <seeking2> SiCuTDeUx: so reiserfs is not as stable as ext3?
[07:51] <manfred22> 7 years old alcoholfree wine, may there alcohol be in it now?
[07:51] <iami89> when i install wine , it error, why, any suggestion?
[07:52] <seeking2> sh4d: I heard that french women are hot! is that true?
[07:52] <sh4d> yeah :)
[07:52] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: no, it's very stable and very very fast, it's a matter of uniqueness
[07:52] <sh4d> you're right :p
[07:52] <SiCuTDeUx> seeking2: :P
[07:52] <iami89> i think i've hear about prog that can convert
[07:53] <jordan> seeking2: ext3 is better at recovering if for instance the power goes out and your computer shuts down improperly
[07:53] <smoenux> does anyone know why my Torrents might be downloading slower than usual ??
[07:53] <myJuly1423> jordan: when you full a ext3 partition the problems come up
[07:53] <SiCuTDeUx> you haven't see Latin woman in my country
[07:53] <manfred22> 7 years old alcoholfree wine, may there alcohol be in it now?
[07:53] <jordan> myJuly1423: I know
[07:53] <manfred22> and is it riskfree to drink?
[07:53] <myJuly1423> jordan: there is not a perfect algoritm for avoid that
[07:53] <iami89> how to read a NTFS partition in ubuntu?
[07:53] <Flannel> manfred22: #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:53] <jordan> myJuly1423: I know

[07:53] <ubotu> iami89: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[07:54] <iami89> and how to remove ubuntu for safe?
[07:54] <myJuly1423> jordan: i think must be to exists a defrag tool in linux or something because that speed up your system
[07:54] <Flannel> iami89: what?
[07:54] <frogma> how do i update my repositories?
[07:54] <jordan> myJuly1423: I am sure there is one, but for most people there will be verry little to no speed increase
[07:55] <grndslm> myJuly1423, fragmentation is for ext2 only
[07:55] <SiCuTDeUx> iami89: ok... you wont need to erase ubuntu from you box...
[07:55] <iami89> why?
[07:55] <uwecpwns> Can someone tell me why my window drives are not mounted by default?
[07:55] <SiCuTDeUx> iami89: because you will love it
[07:55] <grndslm> i've never heard of defragmentation in ext3, at least none that would make a difference
[07:55] <iami89> i love it
[07:55] <SiCuTDeUx> iami89: :D
[07:55] <frogma> how do i update my repositories?

[07:56] <mabus> Help! I am willing to use any distro, I prefer ubuntu. But I can't get any distro to recognize my raid array to boot from it! Only ubuntu and gentoo actually let me write the installation to cd, but I couldn't get grub to boot from the raid array with either distro. Any ideas (with ubuntu obviously)

[07:57] <Flannel> !defrag | myJuly1423
[07:57] <ubotu> myJuly1423: defragmentation is not needed for Ext3 and ReiserFS filesystems. They are much more efficient in their allocation of storage units.
[07:57] <myJuly1423> grndslm always is need to defrag
[07:57] <SiCuTDeUx> iami89: from windows remove linux partition with some partitioning tool, then recover the mbr with fdisk /mbr
[07:57] <grndslm> myJuly1423, not with good design there's no need
[07:57] <myJuly1423> say that to the oracle people
[07:57] <seeking2> mabus: LOL!  you are same guy from Christian channels rght? :)
[07:58] <Madpilot> myJuly1423, not with ext3
[07:58] <seeking2> mabus: you have no idea ;)
[07:58] <iami89> thank
[07:58] <Flannel> mabus: you'll need the alternate CD at any rate.
[07:58] <myJuly1423> in hard disk like the my < 10GB
[07:58] <iami89> but it will work?
[07:58] <myJuly1423> defrag becomig very useable
[07:58] <seeking2> mabus: its me, eternaljoy :)
[07:58] <mabus> seeking2: nope, that's a different guy (damn guy has my nick registered on dal.net ;))
[07:58] <smoenux> does anyone have any idea why my torrents are going slower than usual??
[07:58] <Flannel> myJuly1423: no, you don't understand.  ext3 doesn't need defragging
[07:58] <progek> is there anyone here who can help me with a tomcat question?
[07:58] <mabus> seeking2: I've talked with dalnet mabus before though.
[07:59] <seeking2> mabus: lol! yeah right ;) hehe
[07:59] <seeking2> mabus: ah ok :)
[07:59] <grndslm> myJuly1423, ext3 is designed so that fragmentation is kept to a minimum....it's all in the design, if you want the details...learn to program

[07:59] <mabus> Flannel: thanks
[07:59] <jordan> iami89: I am trying to understand what you want to do, Do you want to uninstall ubuntu and go back to windows?
[07:59] <Silencer> hello all
[07:59] <SiCuTDeUx> iami89: yeah it would work
[08:00] <Flannel> myJuly1423: ext2/3 defragment themselves as part of normal operations, therefore, you don't need to defragment them, ever.
[08:00] <thee3> quodlibet has multimedia keys support but the i installed from repo doesn't. anyone knows how to get it ??
[08:00] <Silencer> can some1 help me i have kernel panic when i want to start installation ubuntu 6.10 :<
[08:00] <iami89> nope
[08:00] <nomad111> how do i change the font color of my panels and menus
[08:00] <grndslm> Flannel, ext2 does that as well??  i thought ext2 actually had dedicated programs for defragging
[08:00] <jordan> Silencer: Are you sure that the CD burned correctly?
[08:00] <iami89> whereas i want to bye bye windows forever and change to linux ^___^
[08:00] <Silencer> jordan,
[08:01] <Silencer> yes ofc
[08:01] <myJuly1423> grndslm i know program
[08:01] <Silencer> i chacked :<
[08:01] <myJuly1423> Flannel you need to align the data sometimes for speed up
[08:01] <jordan> Silencer: What kind of error do you get when it panicks?
[08:01] <draco79> where can i download this files bcmwl5.sys and bcmwl5.inf
[08:02] <mabus> jordan: thanks, but that doesn't really appear to be relevant
[08:02] <grndslm> myJuly1423, believe what you want....
[08:02] <iami89> i am going to make a web site , is anyone here know where to get a free host with good quality and good size too?
[08:02] <Flannel> grndslm: there is a defragger for ext2, but I think it also does it as it goes.
[08:02] <mabus> iami89: if there were big, good, free, hosts... who would pay for one?
[08:03] <joshritger> can someone tell me how to properly remove a jumpdrive in ubuntu?
[08:03] <grndslm> maybe iami89 was asking for the best free hosting site that they knew of
[08:03] <grndslm> maybe host yourself???
[08:03] <iami89> i have to save my own money for many things i have to do
[08:03] <draco79> i know one that cost 10 dollars
[08:03] <iami89> i have not an ip adress
[08:04] <grndslm> how do you connect to the internet?

[08:05] <grndslm> iami89, i don't get it...what do you mean you don't have an ip address??  how are you communicating with us?
[08:05] <iami89> i mean static ip

[08:06] <grndslm> well...you can use dyndns to update a dyndns subdomain name to link to your dhcp address, silly!

[08:07] <grndslm> iami89:  or any other .com/.net/.org site that you register can be redirected to your dhcp address!
[08:07] <iami89> i've know about it
[08:07] <grndslm> then why not host yourself?
[08:07] <Flannel> mabus: did you read that link?

[08:07] <grndslm> iami89, redirection is your best free hosting solution
[08:07] <iami89> ok, i'll try
[08:08] <iami89> <grndslm> redirection is a name?
[08:08] <grndslm> no, definitely not
[08:08] <thee3> anyone. please.
[08:08] <MartinOz> Is there a command line to regenerate /etc/fstab (mtab?) to pick up new drives ?
[08:09] <MartinOz> if i know the command i can look up a howto on the web
[08:09] <grndslm> iami89, i'm saying that if you want something for free, you're going to have to make some tradeoffs, like getting a spare server and learning how to host yourself
[08:09] <grndslm> otherwise, you need to pay
[08:09] <mabus> Flannel: yes
[08:09] <MartinOz> (can't find anything just searching "fstab" or mtab" - too many irrelevent hits)
[08:09] <mabus> Flannel: that's not relevant to the situation
[08:10] <iami89> ah, do you guys know where to get linux game , i've known some but its not much

[08:11] <green> anyone know how to switch ur volume controls from master to pcm?
[08:11] <mabus> Flannel: That's for being able to see an already existing array so that you can migrate data.. not my troubles with differing syntax in fstab/grub between the install cd and the new environment.
[08:11] <BHSPitLappy> my dvd drive is stuck trying to read something on a scratched-up DVD! the totem process won't die! gah!
[08:11] <BHSPitLappy> why can't I tell my computer to stop doing something, and have it listen to me
[08:12] <MartinOz> is it a simple case of creating a directory under /media and mounting that to the /dev device ?
[08:12] <SiCuTDeUx> MartinOz: yeah
[08:12] <jordan> BHSPitLappy: Did you try kill -9?
[08:12] <thee3> BHSPitLappy: add force quit applet to panel and use that. it woks alwya.
[08:12] <MartinOz> maybe sometimes things are too simple and i'm complicating things !! Thanks SiCuTDeUX, I'll dive in and see what happens

[08:14] <MartinOz> thanks SiCuTDeUx
[08:14] <SiCuTDeUx> MartinOz: the best thing to do is to edit the files manually and copy and paste the cdrom line and change de /dev/hdX of the new cdrom and dont need to change anything else

[08:18] <Holylucifer> whats the normal program exe to install, is it bin?
[08:18] <Holylucifer> instead of windows exe.
[08:18] <esc_ape> dustin: k3b, gnomebaker...

[08:19] <dustin> esc_ape, it sais the required blah blah blah is missing...   is there a package i can download?
[08:19] <SiCuTDeUx> i better get some sleep
[08:19] <ndowens> esc_ape: look at kernel.org
[08:19] <SiCuTDeUx> 3:20 am
[08:19] <doppo> anyone having problems with eclipse + cdt with edgy?!
[08:19] <jordan> BHSPitLappy: Sorry, I forget, what problem are you having again?
[08:19] <Xen> SiCuTDeUx, k, thanks.
[08:19] <Melissa|X> no, it definitely wasn't beagle. I noticed it in my menu one day and it had an ugly kind of icon so I tried it. I hit scan and it scans my harddrive for files and orders them according to size so I know what would be best for me to delete
[08:19] <SiCuTDeUx> Xen: thank u
[08:20] <Xen> doppo, yeah, I had a ton of problems.
[08:20] <esc_ape> ndownens: would kernel.org be the same as the ones in the repos?
[08:20] <Xen> doppo, got 'em fixed though; what's yours?
[08:20] <doppo> Xen: No solution at all? I'm tired of removing .metadata everytime
[08:20] <BHSPitLappy> jordan, DVD has some scratchage... the dvd drive gets stuck attempting to read it, and there's nothing I can do about it for like 5 minutes
[08:20] <esc_ape> dustin: what said that?
[08:20] <alkali> Melissa|X: So when you did this you hadn't added much software.  It was part of the standard ubuntu installation?
[08:20] <cubny> how can i copy files from ubuntu folders into windows folders?
[08:20] <ndowens> esc_ape: it would give u a idea of what the changes are, the ones in resp is just the kernel.org kernel plus patches
[08:20] <dustin> gnomebaker
[08:20] <monokrome> :|
[08:20] <dustin> esc_ape,
[08:21] <doppo> Xen: mine happens when I restart eclipse and it keeps giving me an infinite popup saying spomething about "listeners"
[08:21] <Melissa|X> oh no, I had added billions of software. it's the first thing I do to any installation. I've had this installation since the days of Warty in fact, not a single format :D
[08:21] <jordan> BHSPitLappy: Oh, right, and you said there was a process you were trying to kill?
[08:21] <doppo> Xen: the exact infinite message is: "Error notifying a preference change listener""
[08:21] <Holylucifer> brb gonna try gaim :0)
[08:21] <Xen> doppo, yeah
[08:21] <BHSPitLappy> jordan, the media player app likes to hold on when this happens.
[08:21] <monokrome> Anyone in here have experience with FireGL? I have an XPress 200M in this laptop, and fglrx works and all - but I don't have dri. Anyone ever seen this?
[08:21] <Holylucifer> have to load cd
[08:22] <Melissa|X> its just one app I need to know the name of. it's most likely in the universe repo's even. I'm just hoping somebody knows of it
[08:22] <Xen> doppo, did you install CDT via apt?
[08:22] <cubny> NE1 can help me?  how can i copy files from ubuntu folders into windows folders?
[08:22] <rqm> hora hora
[08:22] <alkali> Melissa|X: Um.  And explain what it did one more time in detail?

[08:23] <Melissa|X> well it just allowed me to see an overview of all the files on my filesystem or even in just one directory based off of file size, and it gave little % bar's. it made it very simple to find the biggest files that I can delete to save disk space
[08:23] <cartman> thanks
[08:23] <Xen> doppo, install it via Help->Software Updates->Find and Install.
[08:23] <doppo> Xen: that solves the problem then?
[08:23] <thor> Melissa|X: maybe gtkdiskfree?
[08:24] <rqm> nya kikoemasuka?
[08:24] <Xen> doppo, stupid as it sounds, I ended up installing Edgy twice.  I tried it that way the second time around, and I've not had a single problem.
[08:24] <Melissa|X> no, this isn't it
=== rqm is now known as PyChild
[08:24] <Xen> doppo, so presumably, uninstall on apt, clear out any preferences that it may leave behind, and reinstall through Software Updates.  I think that should do it.
[08:24] <doppo> Xen: wow man! Thanks a lot, I'll drop cdt and reinstall that way. You saved my ass! :D
[08:25] <beerme> no problem, doppo
[08:25] <Melissa|X> this looks like it only does partitions. this did entire directories at a time and gave extremely detailed output, every file in every directory
[08:25] <doppo> Xen: thanks, bye! :)
[08:25] <Xen> doppo, Heh, no problem...glad I could help out, after all the trouble I've caused everyone else on the chan. :P
[08:25] <Xen> doppo, laters.
[08:25] <doppo> :P
[08:25] <Xen> doppo, Hope it works though...
[08:25] <PyChild> hello?
[08:25] <beerme> hallo
[08:25] <beerme> psych[0] ,
[08:25] <FirstStrike> hola
[08:26] <PyChild> Hora
[08:26] <PyChild> Hey i got a qeird question
[08:26] <dustin> esc_ape, it needed to have gstreamer-mad or somehting     i found it in restrictive formats on the wiki
[08:26] <PyChild> w*
[08:26] <beerme> i dont care
[08:26] <savvas> geia
[08:26] <PyChild> u sure?
[08:26] <cubny> ubotu: they're already mounted, all i want is to copy a folder from my home directory to a ntfs directory. is it possible? or i have to do fuse stuffs?! :-/
[08:26] <savvas> any other languages lol
[08:26] <esc_ape> dustin: yeah you need to install mp3 codecs/support before you can do anything
[08:26] <dustin> true
[08:27] <esc_ape> dustin: try automatix
[08:27] <PyChild> anyway what does the sa in sabdfl means?
[08:27] <ndowens> wouldnt it be better for person with dialup to download binaries instead of source
[08:27] <Madpilot> PyChild, Self Appointed
[08:27] <PyChild> Ohh i feel illustrated!
[08:28] <Madpilot> esc_ape, please don't recommend that, it breaks things.
[08:28] <Melissa|X> I feel frustrated
[08:28] <knix> Is there a way to do a text-based install?
[08:28] <Corbo> I feel cocky
[08:28] <PyChild> then who appointed guido for bdfl?
[08:28] <alkali> Melissa|X: It's hard to google something on attributes of a program alone.  Know any of the words in the program title?
[08:28] <knix> The safe graphics mode seems to have changed from dapper to edgy, and I can no longer run X on the livecd
[08:28] <esc_ape> Madpilot: automatix works for me. I only use it to install codecs...
[08:28] <knix> (945gm graphics)
[08:28] <jordan> !automatix | esc_ape
[08:28] <ubotu> esc_ape: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[08:28] <savvas> is the 8776 nvidia driver working ok? i'd like to know before i update
[08:28] <dustin> esc_ape, yeah    especially someone who doesn't seem to know what is going on
[08:29] <cubny> ubotu: they're already mounted, all i want is to copy a folder from my home directory to a ntfs directory. is it possible? or i have to do fuse stuffs?! :-/
[08:29] <Melissa|X> I'm sorry about such a vague description, it's been months since I had discovered it and I can't find it anymore in either my synaptic history nor anywhere else
[08:29] <jordan> !alternate | knix
[08:29] <ubotu> knix: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[08:29] <Corbo> cubny can't you use fat32?
[08:29] <linopil> cubny you keep talking to bot  ubotu ? lol
[08:29] <cubny> corbo: they're ntfs, icant change'em now
[08:29] <PyChild> ok now i got that outta my head I can go to sleep in peace
[08:29] <ndowens> would downloading binarys in apt be faster than emerge sources for a dialup user
[08:30] <Corbo> yeah you can :p
[08:30] <PyChild> byebye
[08:30] <Madpilot> cubny, ubotu is a bot, you know
[08:30] <cubny> :(
[08:30] <alkali> Melissa|X: Was a it a gnome specific program?  Like gtk oriented?
[08:30] <cubny> :((
[08:30] <cubny> i didnt know that
[08:30] <PyChild> sweet dreams/good moring /afternoon / pick the one that suits you better
[08:30] <savvas> ndowens: i think sources are faster
[08:30] <PyChild> depending on your time zone
[08:30] <cryptonic> whats the best method of opening .rar files in ubuntu?
[08:31] <cubny> unrar
[08:31] <jordan> !sabdfl
[08:31] <ubotu> sabdfl is Mark Shuttleworth, self-appointed benevolent dictator for life, cosmonaut, founder of Canonical and primary driver of Ubuntu. Also see http://www.markshuttleworth.com
[08:31] <Melissa|X> yeah, it was definitely gtk (I try not to use anything else because gtk is pretty and nothing else is :P). pretty sure it wasn't gnome specific though
[08:31] <ndowens>  savvas i know i can not sync b/c my net is too slow and apt is faster at updating
[08:31] <savvas> cryptonic: unrar package
[08:31] <cubny> all i want is to copy a folder from my home directory to a ntfs directory. is it possible? or i have to do fuse stuffs?! :-/
[08:32] <Corbo> cubny ntfs is read only unless you use something like fuse
[08:32] <Corbo> and ntfs write is not to be trusted
[08:32] <savvas> ndowens: it's faster at updating because it just gets the package info it does not have
[08:32] <jordan> cubny: You need to either use Fuse, or an intermediate fat partition / thumb drive
[08:32] <cryptonic> savvas : that does nothing in terminal
[08:32] <cubny> it says fuse isnt safe
[08:32] <Corbo> well don't use it then
[08:32] <savvas> cryptonic: sudo apt-get install unrar rar
[08:32] <wastrel> ubunt0
[08:32] <cubny> so, it's not possible
[08:32] <alkali> Melissa|X: I'm checking around but if you go to www.gnomefiles.org and check around they may have it.  It covers a lot of linux programs including programs like you're describing.
[08:33] <jordan> cubny: Wait, there is actually an Ext3 driver for windows
[08:33] <linopil> cubny use USB flash
[08:33] <ndowens> savvas: well emerge just gets the info pretty much as well, just small lil ebuild files in a text file
[08:33] <savvas> cryptonic: that will install unrar and rar packages, use unrar x file.rar to unpack it
[08:33] <Corbo> I had a ntfs drive, I copied everything off of it, wiped it, formatted it as ext3 and moved everything back on, that's your simplest bet
[08:33] <cubny> that's cool linopil
[08:33] <cubny> thanks corbo
[08:33] <Corbo> ok
[08:33] <cubny> but i still use my windows
[08:33] <Holylucifer3> hi guys im on ubuntu live cd useing x chat
[08:33] <cryptonic> savvas : command line only?
[08:33] <savvas> ndowens: oh you're comparing gentoo and ubuntu? if so, i don't know :P
[08:34] <alkali> Melissa|X: I found something very similar called  Baobab  Does this program look familiar?  http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bbshots.html
[08:34] <ndowens> savvas: well according to some site, it takes apt a few secs to update while portage takes 15 mins or so
[08:34] <jordan> Holylucifer3: Try installing something, the install process is my favorite thing about ubuntu :)
[08:34] <Melissa|X> YES! omg thank you so much^^
[08:34] <Holylucifer3> this is the first linux distro ive tryed in my life heh
[08:34] <cubny> can i use share folders?
[08:34] <ndowens> so i figure it may be about the same ratio with downloading
[08:34] <Melissa|X> and I still have it installed too^^
[08:34] <ndowens> Holylucifer3: well maybe u will love linux
[08:34] <Holylucifer3> live cd
[08:34] <savvas> cryptonic: when you install those two, i think you can use the archive manager applications -> accessories -> archive manager
[08:35] <Holylucifer3> cool
[08:35] <ndowens> why don;t u install it
[08:35] <Holylucifer3> 1 hd
[08:35] <alkali> Melissa|X: Lol ironic.  Good luck.  Try not to lose it again ;-)
[08:35] <Holylucifer3> can i have 2 os on 1?
[08:35] <ndowens> yea it's called dual-boot
[08:35] <beerme> xc,
[08:35] <jordan> !dualboot | Holylucifer3
[08:35] <ubotu> Holylucifer3: Dual boot instructions:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo (x86/AMD64)  -  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot (Macintosh)
[08:35] <savvas> Holylucifer3: welcome aboard :D
[08:35] <Melissa|X> lol :P
[08:35] <ndowens> and it will run faster on the HD than cd
[08:36] <jordan> Holylucifer3: Yes, the installer will set it up for you automatically.
[08:36] <Holylucifer3> this needs graphics drivers , im used to nvidias digital viberance and image sharpening
[08:36] <tmorris> I have a D-Link DWL-G510 (ver C2) network card, but it doesn't even show up in lspci - so how can I possibly hope that it will work with some kind of driver? (The power light is on though)
[08:36] <Holylucifer3> :0)
[08:36] <Melissa|X> I only lost it because the gnome menu called it Disk Usage Analyzer instead of Babab whatever that means. once it was taken from my menu it's impossible to find it again o.O
[08:36] <beerme> LOL_AT_WIKIOPS
[08:36] <beerme> strange name
[08:36] <beerme> :s
[08:36] <Holylucifer3> :)
[08:36] <cryptonic> savvas: works now both command and archiver, thx
[08:36] <alkali> Melissa|X: I have that in my new edgy install and they probably renamed it for this distro
[08:36] <ndowens> Holylucifer3: go for it, i hate running off the cd
[08:37] <jordan> Holylucifer3: Nvidia drivers are easy to install, but it's probably not worth doing untill you install to the hard drive :)
[08:37] <Holylucifer3> i have a question, can i installed a game called ut 2004 (although it can run under linux without windows emulators) useing this live cd?
[08:37] <Holylucifer3> i have 1 cd drive :-)
[08:37] <savvas> cryptonic: n/p :) maybe you will have some problems with files with password & encryption, but not really sure about it
[08:38] <Melissa|X> I've been running Edgy since it started beta. if it's in the menu still, then I must be blind again. these menus don't seem to have much organization to them
[08:38] <savvas> cryptonic: in that case, the terminal commands work ok
=== beerme is now known as beermew
[08:38] <cryptonic> lol, just as you said that i got prompted for a password on a .rar im using
[08:38] <cryptonic> :)
[08:38] <jordan> Holylucifer3: Probably not, when you install things on the liveCD it uses your RAM as a temporary disk, you probably don't have enough space
[08:38] <Corbo> Melissa, try using Vista, then you won't be complaining
[08:38] <Melissa|X> >_<
[08:38] <Corbo> lol
[08:39] <Melissa|X> I prefer to keep my blood and innards and all of that intact thank you very much
[08:39] <Corbo> hehe
[08:39] <Corbo> vista drove me to linux, I'm sure I'm not the only one
[08:39] <Holylucifer3> well your not
[08:39] <savvas> someone kick Corbo :P *runs*
[08:39] <Holylucifer3> i am a gamer
[08:39] <Holylucifer3> learning linux today
[08:39] <jStefan> IE7 drove me to firefox and opera
[08:39] <Corbo> was that you Gates?
[08:39] <Holylucifer3> because of it
[08:39] <Melissa|X> Windows XP deleting itself in the middle of a disk cleanup is what drove me to Linux
[08:40] <Corbo> heh microsoft anonymous
[08:40] <Melissa|X> its supposed to delete temp files
[08:40] <Melissa|X> it totally didn't >_<
[08:40] <alkali> I haven't had the priviledge to play with vista?  Does it have the same mind boggling performance drawbacks as XP?
[08:40] <jStefan> Melissa|X, windows is temporary :P
[08:40] <Holylucifer3> i have a game running called nibbles haha
[08:40] <Melissa|X> indeed
[08:40] <savvas> Holylucifer3: you'll love wolfenstein enemy-territory then: http://et.filefront.com
[08:40] <tmorris> Holylucifer3, I used to play that as a kid on a 286 - it is written in qbasic iirc
[08:40] <Holylucifer3> will this install, with live cd
[08:40] <Corbo> alkali: I used the vista rc for a month, it's XP, with more nagging
[08:40] <Holylucifer3> ive played that on win xp
[08:40] <Holylucifer3> spam tastic at times :0)
[08:41] <Holylucifer3> oh wait
[08:41] <Corbo> I don't mind XP so much
[08:41] <Melissa|X> the whole "you have howevermany days to register" message really means "you have howevermany days before you get to redo everything from scratch"
[08:41] <Holylucifer3> use windows xp activation crack
[08:41] <jordan> Holylucifer3: If you install to the hard drive, All the apps you have on the liveCD install also
[08:42] <alkali> Corbo: I played XP but I hated having to figure out what all those services were for.  I missed windows 98 when you had a startup folder and that was it.
[08:42] <Holylucifer3> so if i have both linux and windows on the same hard drive, no harm :/???
[08:42] <Corbo> alkali - but you have services in linux too ?
[08:42] <jordan> alkali: You missed 98?!?
[08:42] <kikia>  ^0^/
[08:42] <Corbo> anyhow: Holy do you have lots of RAM?
[08:42] <alkali> Corbo: Yes but they are not as processor intensive
[08:42] <phaedra> Holylucifer3, I've dual booted for years.  No problem...
[08:42] <Holylucifer3> 512mb
[08:43] <Corbo> ok
[08:43] <Corbo> if you had more ram holy your other option is to run XP in a vmware machine
[08:43] <ndowens> i only have 128mb of ram, and i've ran ubuntu on it
[08:43] <Holylucifer3> thats 512mb pc3200 2.6ghz /ht 120gb hd, although not full
[08:43] <ndowens> everytime some distro says i need blah and i don't have it, it works fine
[08:43] <alkali> jordan: Of course.  It was a simple time.  A time when I deleted a file it actually went away.  It didn't have 5 backups and told me that the driver I was using wasn't XP certified.  I was in control
[08:43] <james296> how can I uninstall EasyUbuntu?
[08:44] <grant> hi guys, anyone here familiar with QEMU?
[08:44] <alkali> Download an ubuntu liveCD and start over
[08:44] <alkali> :-D
[08:44] <Holylucifer3> well in applications i see a add and remove
[08:44] <Corbo> alkali: I was with a home user the other day who had just re-installed 98..no firewall..broadband modem...it lasted about 5 seconds
[08:44] <jordan> !easyubuntu
[08:44] <ubotu> easyubuntu is easyubuntu is a script that automates installation of some items. Use at your own risk. See http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/  -  For help and or discussions about EasyUbuntu please join #easyubuntu
[08:44] <Melissa|X> gaim likes to crash >_<
[08:44] <Holylucifer3> or just.. reload the cd
[08:44] <Melissa|X> wonder what I was expecting with beta 4 =\
[08:44] <alkali> Melissa|X: 2.0?
[08:44] <grant> hi guys, anyone here familiar with QEMU?
[08:45] <alkali> Corbo: That's cause we didn't have all that fancy high speed in 98
[08:45] <Corbo> yes, we were just hacked slower
[08:45] <Melissa|X> 2.0beta4 is so much fun to crash </sarcasm>
[08:45] <alkali> Corbo: Yes.  and most people didn't bother because usually we'd shut down our dial up before anyone could get in because AOL kicked us off so frequently
[08:46] <jordan> Holylucifer3: Install to the hard drive, you know you want to :)
[08:46] <Corbo> AOL?  You'd already been hacked mate ;p
[08:46] <alkali> lol good poiny
[08:46] <alkali> *point
[08:46] <Xen> how can I make a symbolic link to every item in a folder inside another folder?
[08:46] <grant> hey guys can you please help with this, have just installed edgy and have a winxp hd connected as slave, want to run xp inside ubuntu but can't use vmware, i'm look for an alternative, suggestions?
[08:47] <grant> sorry looking
[08:47] <Corbo> why can't you use vmware?
[08:47] <alkali> grant: correct me if I'm wrong but I think you have to install XP in vmware
[08:47] <alkali> like qemu
[08:47] <Holylucifer3> ive found return to castle wolfenstine et for lunx v2.6
[08:47] <grant> i mucked up the install and now it is sure its installed even though its not
[08:47] <crimsun> Xen: lndir(1x)
[08:47] <Corbo> yep, you'd have to image it, then restore it in the vmware machine
[08:47] <Holylucifer3> gonna download wonder if it can install
[08:47] <Xen> 1x being the source or dest?
[08:47] <grant> no way that i can run an already working install?
[08:48] <crimsun> Xen: 1x being the manual section.
[08:48] <crimsun> Xen: cf. xutils-dev
[08:48] <grant> really don't want to have to dual boot
[08:48] <Corbo> grant what are you trying the achieve?
[08:48] <grant> hey corbo, have a working xp installed on primary slave and want to run it inside a window in edgy
[08:48] <alkali> grant: you could emulate XP but you'd need to backup the data
[08:48] <Xen> crimsun, got it, thanks
[08:49] <grant> how do you mean alkali?
[08:49] <Corbo> grant, I am doing that right now, but in VMWare, I don't know what the alternatives are
[08:49] <alkali> grant: Well you want edgy to be your main operating system right?
[08:49] <grant> corbo, any suggestions for how i can fix the mucked up vmware server install?
[08:49] <grant> alkali, yes
[08:49] <Corbo> just run it again
[08:50] <grant> corbo, it says already installed and quits
[08:50] <grant> but vmware isn't installed
[08:50] <Corbo> bummer, is it showing in the package manager?
[08:50] <grant> nope
[08:50] <Corbo> and have you installed the vmware gui?
[08:50] <grant> well i've tried to but it isn't working
[08:50] <alkali> grant: I've read that you backup all the files you have in XP and clear both drives installing edgy.  Then get the program called qemu and emulate an XP install  and once you have XP running you restore your files to the emulated windows XP.
[08:50] <alkali> There is a walkthrough on it
[08:51] <unikuser> Can we use intel virtualization technology(IVT) for emulation here/
[08:51] <grant> thanks alkali but i'm trying to avoid going through the whole xp install process
[08:51] <alkali> lol well now you're just being picky ;-)
[08:51] <grant> lol
[08:51] <Corbo> http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_vmware_server_p2
[08:52] <Corbo> have you done that bit grant?
[08:52] <alkali> Ubuntu has the best guides
[08:52] <grant> well i've been running that xp box for about 2 years, so everything is finally setup to some kind of acceptable standard, don't want to go through it all again (installed edgy 4 days ago and almost at the same stage, anyone else noticing a time difference?) lmao
[08:52] <grant> two secs corbo, i'll have a look
[08:53] <Flannel> howtoforge has some really crappy ones, by the way.  Basically breaking the ubuntu-ness of your install.
[08:53] <Corbo> grant, either way, if you want to get your real machine in to a vrtual machine you're going to have to sysprep it, image it, and restore it in to the virtual machine
[08:53] <grant> was worried you were going to say something like that corbo
[08:53] <Dewi> does wireless WPA work out of the box yet?
[08:53] <Dewi> (on edgy)
[08:53] <alkali> Flannel: You just got to pick and choose.   But many other distros are like, "Google it and good luck."
[08:53] <Flannel> grant: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VmwareServer  Is probably a better one, rather than the howtoforge
[08:53] <crimsun> Dewi: no, still requires configuration.
[08:54] <jordan> Flannel: I only really trust Howtos from wiki.ubuntu.com
[08:54] <Dewi> crimsun: but does it require installing packages out of universe, like it did a year ago?
[08:54] <grant> yeah i had a look at that flannel but it insists that its already installed
[08:54] <Dewi> wpa-supplicant
[08:54] <crimsun> Dewi: no, wpasupplicant shipped in main as of 6.06
[08:54] <Dewi> or whatever
[08:54] <Dewi> crimsun: nod
[08:54] <Dewi> crimsun: I didn't try any 6.* yet
[08:54] <Dewi> crimsun: tempting though
[08:54] <Xen> crimsun, that's not exactly what I intended...that makes directories and then symlinks the files....I just want a top level symlink to everything in the top dir...
[08:55] <crimsun> Xen: time for some perl, then.
[08:55] <grant> getting a horrible feeling i'm going to end have to keep swapping these in the bios, oh well, even if i could get the thing to run i'd probably have to reactivate xp dual to major hardware change
[08:55] <Corbo> grant, can't you setup grub to give you a dual boot menu ?
[08:56] <pgurumur> does anybody know to disable sudo + pam on a NIS env on ubuntu dapper?
[08:56] <Xen> Crimsun, might just do that...but not this second, I think (not too good at perl).  Thanks for trying though.
[08:56] <grant> hey corbo, don't really know enough about grub and so not messing about with it after the number of muck ups i had with lilo
[08:57] <grant> i confess my ideal image...
[08:57] <alkali> grant: grub and lilo are two diff creatures
[08:57] <alkali> grub is much much much easier
[08:57] <alkali> IMO
[08:57] <jordan> alkali: Unless you use a mac ;)
[08:57] <grant> was running edgy with windows running fullscreen on a desktop and just jumping between them with 3ddesk, it would look really really cool, and i could laugh at all the windows users lol
[08:58] <alkali> jordan: not here to argue with you.....cause I don't own a mac :-D
[08:58] <donaldo> I'm installing on a Powerbook with a broken backlight. How can I force the installer to display on a separate display?
[08:58] <Corbo> do you think apple will make OSX compatible with none apple hardware anytime soon?
[08:58] <Corbo> I've tried the hacked osx on my PC and it worked a treat
[08:58] <grant> hey alkali, to be honest diving in the bios isn't really a big deal, would really rather not muck about with the bootloader yet
[08:58] <grant> only had ubuntu for about 4 days
[08:59] <ndowens> Corbo: most likely, but it will probably be a long time if they do
[08:59] <alkali> grant: It's true.  But in the end the research will do you good and it will always to be nice if one or the other messes up you don't have to open your computer to use an OS.
[08:59] <jordan> Corbo: Never, they are a hardware manufacturur first and foremost, but they sell their hardware by it's OSX compatability
[09:00] <Corbo> yes, but it's more compatible than they let on...I've had it running on a xeon dell
[09:00] <ndowens> i figured maybe if they wanted more sales they might eventually sell MACOSX for intel pcs
[09:00] <grant> thats true alkali, just would have liked the finesse of live switching os's
[09:00] <Corbo> grant, get another PC and a kvm switch
[09:01] <Holylucifer3> heh get linux for free and play games made for linux os.
[09:01] <ndowens> that is just my opinion sometime later down the road
[09:01] <grant> corbo, nice ideal but i'm not exactly rolling in it...just a poor student
[09:01] <grant> here is a laugh for you guys
[09:01] <Corbo> steal one
[09:01] <Seeker2599> im trying to transfer an .avi file to my windows pc from my ubuntu laptop using a flash drive but every time i try to open the file with windows its corrupted, does anyone know why or have a solution to my problem?
[09:01] <alkali> What a fun dream.  A day when two OS's, one owned by a monopoly and one built by people for people, coming together to work seamlessly.  Sounds like a longshot
[09:02] <grant> define irony, noob linux user going through all this to run xp inside linux in order to run visual certexam to qualify as MCSE? lol
[09:02] <Corbo> lol grant: ditto
[09:02] <donaldo> Seeker2599: are you sure it's corrupted? are you sure you don't simply lack the proper video ccodec?
[09:02] <Corbo> except I'm running testout
[09:02] <Corbo> I was just too scared to admit it in a linux room :p
[09:03] <grant> on a much lighter note, can anyone tell me any significant differences between beryl and 3ddesk?
[09:03] <alkali> I think we have to vote Corbo off our island
[09:03] <Corbo> lol
[09:03] <Melissa|X> oki, finally after 3gb freespace is turned into 20, I may go to bed :D
[09:03] <Melissa|X> thanks for your help^^
[09:03] <Corbo> well sometimes you just have to take one for the team when it comes to getting a job
[09:03] <grant> quick everyone Corbo admitted to working for the man, get him....lol
[09:03] <alkali> Melissa|X: woohoo.  So you did sudo rm -rf / huh?
[09:04] <grant> well thanks for your help anyways, corbo, alkali
[09:04] <Melissa|X> I wish. Windows could benefit from that :D
[09:04] <Corbo> np
[09:04] <Seeker2599> donaldo: i have the codec, when i plug the flash drive into my pc the file says "filename url:fileprotocal"
[09:04] <grant> on a much lighter note, can anyone tell me any significant differences between beryl and 3ddesk?
[09:04] <donaldo> lol alkali, shell commands are uber-funny
[09:04] <Melissa|X> I just had to delete a few really ugly big things taking all my space so I can put more games in Windows
[09:04] <grant> i.e. which is better?
[09:04] <alkali> lol good times.  Microsoft send me 5 dollars for every linux user I force back to windows
[09:04] <alkali> I'm rolling in cash
[09:04] <jordan> grant: Beryl can do a LOT more
[09:05] <alkali> <--kidding
[09:05] <Melissa|X> nighty night, I'm tired and I feel bad from dealing with concentrated ammonium in Chem today >_<
[09:05] <Seeker2599> filename of course being replaced with the true filename
[09:05] <grant> hey jordan, just seen people having a lot of trouble getting it running, any suggestions for a good edgy install guide?
[09:05] <Corbo> grant one other thing: If you're testing software includes videos, don't expect them to run well in vmware
[09:05] <donaldo> Seeker2599: the file "says" this? what exactly does that mean
[09:05] <jordan> !beryl
[09:05] <ubotu> beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/  -  Please see #ubuntu-xgl for help with beryl.
[09:06] <Holylucifer3> im downloading et for linux 258.4mb, what does ubuntu do with large files like these being downloaded?
[09:06] <grant> hey corbo, they still haven't gotten around the directx stuff?
[09:06] <jordan> grant: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BerylOnEdgy
[09:06] <Corbo> there is experimental directx but it doesnt help
[09:06] <Seeker2599> donaldo: instead of it telling me its a movie file it tells me url:fileprotocal
[09:06] <grant> thanks guys, i'll go read about beryl, think the bottom line is you are saying there is no competition between 3ddesk and it yeah?
[09:07] <Seeker2599> donaldo: i tried opening it with my Divx player but then it says its corrupt
[09:07] <Holylucifer3> i have a question how do you install a program when useing live cd, i mean when you download from browser and when its done, but it gives me these errors and 2 options for codes O_o
[09:07] <alkali> Seeker2599: Try VLC media player
[09:07] <conorunner> I cannot get higher resolution than  1024x768 on my Nvidia TNT2 32mb video card
[09:08] <jordan> Holylucifer3: What are you trying to install?
[09:08] <Seeker2599> alkali: is there a vlc player for windows?
[09:08] <alkali> conorunner: Can your card handle high resolution?
[09:08] <donaldo> Seeker2599: yes
[09:08] <alkali> Seeker2599: of course
[09:08] <conorunner> I think maybe ubuntu has a default moniter driver installed
[09:08] <Holylucifer3> well im downloading a free game to play on this linux os but not installed its live cd
[09:08] <jordan> !nvidia | conorunner
[09:08] <ubotu> conorunner: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:08] <grant> corbo, think i have the perfect solution, i'm going to setup another pc with twice the system specs of my other one (so that windows runs at the same speed as ubuntu) then i'm going to setup gigabit crossovers between them and use a remote desktop app supporting audio, i think that will work, now where did i put that winning lottery ticket....
[09:08] <conorunner> I can get higher on windows(when it was installed)
[09:08] <Seeker2599> !vlc media player
[09:08] <ubotu> vlc: multimedia player and streamer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-1ubuntu1 (edgy), package size 1120 kB, installed size 3240 kB
[09:08] <Seeker2599> anyone have a website for it?
[09:09] <Terminus> Seeker2599: vlc? videolan.org
[09:09] <Seeker2599> thanks
[09:09] <jordan> conorunner: Have you installed the nvidea drivers?
[09:09] <alkali> conorunner: You could google your monitor specs and note the horizontal and vertical refresh rates and modify your xorg.conf
[09:09] <alkali> If VLC can't read it, no one can.
[09:10] <conorunner> I will try the drivers

[09:10] <grant> anyone else find it amusing how search for has now officially been replaced with google? talk about marketing
[09:10] <Corbo> yeah, I like the way MS is trying to rip off google with its Live search
[09:10] <Seeker2599> is there a way i can do somthing like a direct connection between my machines without having to setup a network?
[09:10] <jordan> grant: Actually, for copywrite reasons google would rather not have you "googling" things.
[09:11] <Corbo> seeker, get a crossover cable
[09:11] <donaldo> Seeker2599: really that's basically the definition of a network. connections between machines.
[09:11] <grant> well personally i'm not convinced there there isn't some long term buyout plan for Altavista, hmm.... Altavista....Windows Vista....
[09:11] <conorunner> how can I find out what kernal is installed?
[09:11] <Corbo> you're on to something
[09:11] <Terminus> conorunner: uname -a
[09:11] <conorunner> is it ver at term
[09:11] <conorunner> ok
[09:11] <grant> Windows AltaVista Edition
[09:11] <jordan> conorunner: uname -r
[09:11] <conorunner> thanks
[09:11] <ale[x] > anyone know if it possible to install the beta nvidia drivers and keep the linux restricted package installed?
[09:11] <Flannel> grant, Corbo, take general chatter to #ubuntu-offtopic please
[09:11] <Corbo> there are already 6 editions!!
[09:12] <Seeker2599> if i connected them with a cat-5 would i be able to transfer files?
[09:12] <kikokos> hi
[09:12] <grant> sorry flannel, done now
[09:12] <Terminus> Seeker2599: yes
[09:12] <Seeker2599> without using a router
[09:12] <Terminus> Seeker2599: yes again
[09:12] <kikokos> what should I do with a "core dumoed" ?
[09:12] <Terminus> Seeker2599: as long as it's a crossover cable. wiring is different.
[09:12] <Corbo> seeker yes, with crossed over cat 5 you don't even need a switch
[09:12] <Flannel> grant: oh, I really don't want you to cut it short, just go to the appropriate channel, that's why it's there, for us to be social
[09:12] <kikokos> core dumped...application crashed with this
[09:12] <bezibaerchen> anyone around who knows about sound in browser (e.g. youtube, pandora) playing fine for a while and then just stopping? --> EDGY
[09:12] <Seeker2599> ok then, but i still would have to go through the network manager wouldnt i
[09:12] <Seeker2599> on windows
[09:13] <Corbo> it's a network yes
[09:13] <Terminus> Seeker2599: of course. you'll have to set ip and stuff.
[09:13] <alkali> kikokos: what were you doing when it said this?
[09:13] <grant> sorry flannel, what room did you say it was?
[09:13] <Terminus> Seeker2599: unless one of the computers is running dhcpd...
[09:13] <jordan> ale[x] : I think that is just a meta-package, I don't think you need it.
[09:13] <Seeker2599> ok this is going to be an adventure
[09:13] <Flannel> grant: #ubuntu-offtopic
[09:13] <kikokos> I tried view video file
[09:13] <kikokos> vlc
[09:13] <grant> thanks
[09:13] <alkali> kikokos: probably the file itself.  Do other video's or music play fine
[09:13] <alkali> ?
[09:14] <kikokos> no
[09:14] <kikokos> no other
[09:14] <kikokos> I show you
[09:14] <Terminus> Seeker2599: if you want to make your own cable, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA/EIA-568-B for the color codes.
[09:14] <ale[x] > i need it for my wireless card but nvidia wants to remove it
[09:15] <Seeker2599> will ubuntu automatically detect my network with my other machine?
[09:15] <Terminus> Seeker2599: that would mean you have your own crimper. if you don't just go to your neighborhood computer store and buy one from them.
[09:15] <alkali> kikokos: If other files play fine it may be that the file that caused the crash is corrupt or you do not have the codec required to view it.
[09:15] <Corbo> who was asking about beryl?
[09:15] <Terminus> Seeker2599: no, unless the other machine is running dhcpd, which it probably won't.
[09:15] <alkali> Corbo: grant was
[09:15] <kikokos> alkali I have codecs....
[09:15] <Corbo> grant: beryl video of it in use: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv_GQxL3T2M
[09:15] <Seeker2599> ok, i will probably be back, i gotta go play with cables
[09:16] <alkali> kikokos: then it was just that file
[09:16] <alkali> damn ati and their lack of well working 3D accel
[09:16] <alkali> I want beryl
[09:16] <kikokos> alakli what this mean "core dumped" it`s info about what?
[09:16] <jordan> alkali: You can have beryl
[09:17] <unikuse1> hey i'm using ati x1600 and beryl is wroking really good on my comp
[09:17] <alkali> kikokos: Basically what it means is there was a failure to read the file and it made the program crash.  And a core dump is done so you don't lose any information or damage your operating system.
[09:18] <Terminus> Seeker2599: ip addresses, gateways, dns, etc. aren't pulled out of thin air. a dhcp server issues those. a router can usually double as a dhcp server. if you don't have any of those, you will have to configure manually.
[09:18] <alkali> jordan: without 3d accel?  Tell me more.
[09:18] <kikokos> alkali that`s grate :)
[09:18] <kikokos> greate
[09:18] <Seeker2599> if i used a router it wouldnt need to be connected to the my dsl line would it?
[09:18] <alkali> kikokos: does that answer your question?
[09:19] <Terminus> Seeker2599: nope.
[09:19] <freakabcd> hi all
[09:19] <freakabcd> anyone here on dapper and using beryl: does 'Fetch Themes' actually get new themes for you in emerald themer ?
[09:19] <jordan> alkali: Set up 3D accell...
[09:20] <alkali> jordan: yea.....you must not have ati
[09:20] <jordan> alkali: I do.
[09:20] <alkali> jordan: which driver set and kernel are you using?
[09:21] <kikokos> yes....but as yet I can`t open any fillms. When I tried open DVD I saw :http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30131/
[09:21] <Seeker2599> im going to try one more thing before i set this up, i was using avidemux to trim the files before i transferred them, im going to try an edited file
[09:21] <jordan> alkali: Their xorg script ( and yes thier drivers too ) are crap but dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh usually works
[09:21] <hakrzcode> jordan, ATI does not support composite and glx. Turns off glx with composite enabled.
[09:21] <Seeker2599> try with an unedited file*
[09:21] <kikokos> alkali I never see nothing I dont know why it`s that :P?
[09:21] <jordan> hakrzcode: But you can still use XGL
[09:22] <hakrzcode> yes, but isn't Beryl compiz?
[09:22] <kikokos> could you look at this?
[09:22] <alkali> kikokos: You don't see any movies at all?
[09:22] <freakabcd> hakrzcode, beryl is a fork
[09:22] <hakrzcode> yes, but it's main function is composite. Is that not the reason to use it?
[09:22] <jordan> hakrzcode: And XGL does not require texture-from-pixmap only AIGLX
[09:23] <hakrzcode> ic
[09:23] <kikokos> do u see my terminal-log? It is new things in my system...but since 3 days I cannnot watch video
[09:23] <kikokos> I have many strange(?) infomrataion e.x. this
[09:24] <alkali> kikokos: I am unable to see your log.  Can you post it to pastebin?

[09:24] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[09:25] <kikokos> alkali totem try play DVD
[09:25] <hakrzcode> kikokos, usually running a video program from command line will usually spit out a reason for not playing. Have you tried this?
[09:25] <squidly> hello again
[09:25] <alkali> kikokos: I'm not real good with totem.  I don't recommend using it personally.  I use VLC or XINE.
[09:25] <kikokos> alkali I show u from vlc
[09:26] <squidly> alkali: for what dvd's they both rock
[09:26] <squidly> anyone know how to chagne a "server
[09:26] <squidly> anyone know how to chagne a "server" install to the desktop install?
[09:26] <alkali> squidly: totem always crashed on me though.  always.
[09:26] <squidly> alkali: ive never used totem..
[09:26] <alkali> squidly: Add more packages?
[09:26] <alkali> ;-)
[09:26] <squidly> lol alkali
[09:27] <Crazed> is it safe to do a dist upgrade in dapper to get edgy ? :)
[09:27] <squidly> well I was doing a alternate install and it should have gotten me to a "normal" install
[09:27] <alkali> squidly: did you add xorg gnome all that stuff?
[09:27] <squidly> i did add xorg and im adding gnome now
[09:27] <kikokos> alkali vlc try watch DVD http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30133/
[09:27] <alkali> kikokos: Are you sure you have a dvd drive?
[09:28] <Seeker2599> well i solved the problem with transferring my avi's, windows doesnt like them after avidemux trims them
[09:28] <thyko> apache2 seems not to have a httpd.conf. Was it renamed to something else or what?
[09:28] <kikokos> usually I dont use totem but now I try everything :P
[09:28] <squidly> is there a package for the nvidia binary-blob drivers?
[09:28] <kikokos> alkali how I can test it?
[09:28] <hakrzcode> kikokos, running your error through google came up with: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-194746.html
[09:29] <freakabcd> thyko, httpd2.conf ?
[09:29] <hakrzcode> kikokos, look at the solution on that page.
[09:29] <alkali> well dvd drives are mentioned in the hardware section of the manual.  You may have the codecs but if you don't have a dvd drive you can't watch dvds
[09:29] <jpotex> Is 6.10 good for go, even though its a codename on it? It seem to be the only version working with my hardware

[09:29] <kikokos> hakrzcode ok
[09:29] <MugginsM> some DVD drives still block Linux
[09:29] <ndowens> how can i patch the kernel with more than 1 patch, i am patching like i am suppose to like the 1st patch 1st and 2nd patch 2nd until i get to the kernel ver i want
[09:29] <alkali> squidly: but he can't use a cd-rw drive and put a dvd in and it read it
[09:30] <MugginsM> but not many
[09:30] <squidly> alkali: oh yea.. umm that would be kinda hard
[09:30] <alkali> his log says it may not be a dvd drive
[09:31] <alkali> kikokos: did you find out if it was a dvd drive?
[09:31] <hakrzcode> alkali, take note that it was reading the DVD. Must be DVD.
[09:31] <squidly> alkali: yea that would kinda say its not a dvd drive
[09:31] <squidly> hakrzcode: not necessarly
[09:31] <squidly> what do you mean by "Reading" it
[09:31] <alkali> not according to his logfile hakrzcode

[09:33] <kikokos> alkali probably...

[09:34] <alkali> I can google the specs
[09:34] <squidly> alkali: I believe them it was  advd
[09:34] <cheesewhiz> Just want to know before I try, is it possible to install Ubuntu to a USB flash drive, and have it boot from it? I know some BIOSes don't support it, but for the ones that do, will it work?
[09:34] <squidly> can you read the disk form anything?
[09:34] <Toma-> cheesewhiz: i belive so yes
[09:34] <alkali> cheesewhiz: server install maybe.  Not a full desktop I don't think
[09:34] <squidly> can you mount it and do you ahve raw access to the disk?
[09:34] <cheesewhiz> alkali: why not?
[09:34] <squidly> cheesewhiz: the desktop does have a "live"cd
[09:35] <squidly> as for a flash drive IDK
[09:35] <cheesewhiz> I wanted a full desktop install on a 1gig flash drive
[09:35] <cheesewhiz> is that possible?
[09:35] <squidly> cheesewhiz: umm there may not be enough room there
[09:35] <alkali> cheesewhiz: I take it back.  It might work
[09:35] <alkali> I was thinking expanded it was more than 1 gig
[09:35] <alkali> thats why you need the swap file
[09:36] <cheesewhiz> alkali: so do you think 1gig is not enough?
[09:36] <hakrzcode> cheesewhiz.. yep, it will work but you will have to tweek with apps, for size.
[09:36] <Seeker2599> is there a windows version of avidemux?
[09:37] <alkali> cheesewhiz: if you can do a server install to the flash drive and add packages you need

[09:38] <hakrzcode> no prob. seeker, usually if you run '"program name" win32' through google, you can usually be delightfully surprised. Do this for alot of my friends.
[09:38] <alkali> kikokos: did you figure out the make and model of your computer?
[09:39] <kikokos> alkali as yet no
[09:39] <n1gke> kikokos, can I help you find that ?

[09:41] <leftjustified> howdy :) Anyone here have success running Tribes 2 under ubuntu? From what I've read the win version dies under WINE, but there IS a linux version out there somewhere... I just can't find the files :( I've got a key and all -- it's legit -- just need the game files!
[09:41] <squidly> ahh there we go aptitude to the rescue ^^
[09:42] <n1gke> kikokos, Hi. 1st. If you open a terminal window
[09:42] <Toma-> leftjustified: there is a linux version.
[09:42] <leftjustified> Toma-: I know, but I can't find anywhere to d/l it
[09:42] <Toma-> leftjustified: try playing legends. much better, GPL and more of an online community
[09:42] <n1gke> kikokos, 2nd. In the terminal window type, sudo apt-get hwinfo
[09:42] <leftjustified> Toma-: thanks, will check it out -- playing tribes 2 is more for nostalgia though and I've got buddies who still play it on winbloze
[09:43] <hakrzcode> kikokos, definately looks like you have a new chip. Video buffer size is not recognized probably.
[09:43] <n1gke> kikokos, 3rd. You may have to adjust the parameters for the terminal window to scroll back to 2000  lines as the default is only 500.
[09:43] <me_> what's the difference between add/delete and the package manager?
[09:43] <alkali> kikokos: people with a similar problem did this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-194746.html

[09:44] <hakrzcode> nlgke, for resource hogs like me, you can also do 5000, easier just to put another 0 on the end.
[09:44] <SpComb> squidly: linux uses your ram to cache your hard drive instead of letting it sit around useless
[09:44] <hakrzcode> ok
[09:44] <SpComb> squidly: what does it show for +/- cache?
[09:44] <n1gke> kiko4th. After hwinfo does its thing, scroll back toward the top of the informations, you will find absolutely everything about your computer.
[09:44] <squidly> like 100
[09:44] <SpComb> used?
[09:45] <squidly> no used is 992
[09:45] <alkali> kikokos: they had to add lines to their xorg.conf file because the player could not play at high resolutions.  Maybe it will work for you
[09:45] <kikokos> nlgke hwinfo doing nothing
[09:45] <n1gke> hakrzcode, I know, that's what I did, or added enough lines to get the whole information on one page eh.
[09:45] <squidly> SpComb: i know how linux does the caching for scsi drives (and sata drive)
[09:45] <SpComb> squidly: for +/- buffers and cache? Then you have something that's eating a lot of ram :P
[09:45] <alkali> kikokos: or maybe re-installing the nvidia drivers will work.  Who knows.
[09:45] <squidly> im just shocked that its using that much ram!
[09:45] <SpComb> just use top and hit > to get a list of processes sorted by ram use
[09:45] <squidly> even when I had a soruce based linux system it never used that much!
[09:45] <Toma-> leftjustified: btw, tell your friends theres a windows client for legends
[09:46] <hakrzcode> nlgke: that is the first thing I do with a fresh gnome install.
[09:46] <kikokos> alkali ok i try solution from this page
[09:46] <err_> what's the best way to upgrade from ubuntu -> kubuntu?
[09:46] <alkali> kikokos: best of luck.  Let me know how it goes
[09:46] <n1gke> hakrzcode, I do that every time I add either hard or software, and print it out to study the changes.
[09:46] <hakrzcode> err_: apt-get install kubuntu
[09:47] <captine> hi all.  am little stressed.  followed instruction at http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=285809&highlight=bcm4318 for installing wifi network.  now my wireless light is flashing, and my cpu fan is going nuts -- processor running at 90% for last 20minutes.  ???
[09:47] <captine> am on a compaq presario notebook
[09:47] <jordan> err_: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get autoremove ubuntu-desktop
[09:48] <tgelter> hey all, what's the flag to do a "make-kpkg" with many concurrent compile processes at once? (for dual core cpu)
[09:48] <err_> how come you use terminal commands rather than the GUI programs?
[09:48] <alkali> captine: did the wireless work or is it freezing the computer?
[09:48] <squidly> arg new install forgot to run updatedb ><
[09:48] <jordan> err_: They are faster / easier to explain on IRC
[09:48] <captine> alkali: not frozen.  the wireless light just flashes.  how do i check if it works ?? am very new.
[09:49] <jordan> err_: Also I don'
[09:49] <err_> what's the difference between add/remove programs and the synaptic package manager?
[09:49] <tonyyarusso> What do I have to do to get the helvetica font?
[09:49] <jordan> err_: Also I don't know how to do autoremove with a GUI.
[09:49] <alkali> captine: Go to firefox or a web browser and see if you have internet
[09:49] <squidly> so far though I'm loveing ubunto
[09:49] <squidly> ive got a server at work running it with nagios^^
[09:50] <err_> what's better, ubuntu or kubuntu?
[09:50] <n1gke> hakrzcode, I am using two computers 'ere, both with i686-SMP.
[09:50] <ndowens> squidly: is ubuntu ur first linux?
[09:50] <jordan> err_: That is subjective
[09:50] <captine> alkali:       that means i must disconnect the wired device, cos i am in the internet.  can wire and wireless run at same time?
[09:50] <tonyyarusso> err_: Personal preference
[09:50] <alkali> err_: better question.  Which one do you think is prettier?
[09:50] <err_> not sure, which one is more mac os x like?
[09:50] <Pizza> hello :] 
[09:51] <ndowens> hello
[09:51] <tonyyarusso> err_: Either, depending on how you configure them.
[09:51] <alkali> err_: lol whichever one you download the theme for.  But honestly.  E17 is the most like mac OSX
[09:51] <n1gke> hakrzcode, This computer is the HP Kayak XU800 with two 733 Mhz CPU.
[09:51] <meton_magis> i've got a problem installing my games from Loki, anyone wanna be nice and help me??
[09:51] <Pizza> I've got a problem while updating to Edgy -> apt-get says  it can't replace "libGL.so.1" with different file "libGL.so.1.xlibmesa" <-- any ideas ?
[09:51] <err_> where do i find out about themes?
[09:51] <alkali> captine: You do have to disconnect wired connection, restart your computer, and test the internet.  Unless you have a wep password and then you have to enter it
[09:51] <hakrzcode> ok nlgke: I will run through google.
[09:51] <squidly> ndowens: not by a long shot
[09:51] <jordan> Pizza: You shouldn't use apt to upgrade.
[09:52] <squidly> just my first debian type distro
[09:52] <Pizza> jordan: what else ?
[09:52] <ndowens> squidly: me either
[09:52] <alkali> By the way.....when is E-17 gonna be ready for ubuntu?
[09:52] <captine> alkali: will try, but why would my processor be running at max?? any ideas?
[09:52] <squidly> I used to develop for smgl
[09:52] <n1gke> err_, try this: http://www.gnome-look.org/
[09:52] <ndowens> squidly: i am on gentoo but waiting on my ubuntu cd
[09:52] <err_> how come ubuntu doesn't automatically come with something in the GUI that shows my internet connect?
[09:52] <squidly> ndowens: dl your ubuntu cd ^^
[09:52] <tonyyarusso> err_: art.gnome.org and gnome-look.org for Gnome, there's a kdelook too
[09:52] <squidly> that is what I did
[09:52] <ndowens> squidly: dialup
[09:52] <jordan> Pizza: gksu "update-manager -c" but it may be too late, thigs may already be screwed up.
[09:53] <Pizza> jordan: used it
[09:53] <squidly> ouch.. ok umm.. never mind.
[09:53] <Ayabara> I helped find a patch for the dapper kernel that I miss in edgy. Is it possible to find out what that patch was? I was registered with an email
[09:53] <Pizza> jordan: but it says I should fix the problem with apt-get -f install
[09:53] <ndowens> squidly: lol yup
[09:53] <alkali> captine: that could be  number of things.  That usually means the processor is tapped out with information so a restart might do it some good with the wired internet disconnected .  Just try and if it doesn't work swing back in here.
[09:53] <err_> ty guys
[09:53] <err_> btw whats hte difference b/w add/remove and the synaptic package manager???
[09:53] <squidly> ndowens: how can you live on dialup??
[09:53] <captine> alkali: cool
[09:53] <Pizza> jordan: but I think the most things are really screwed up :D
[09:53] <jordan> Pizza: I thought you meant you used apt-get dist upgrade when you said you used apt, sorry :)
[09:54] <tonyyarusso> err_: Add/Remove just has some common things but is pretty; Synaptic has everything but is a little more intimidating
[09:54] <Pizza> jordan: you needn't to feel sorry
[09:54] <ndowens> squidly: it is not by choice, it's not my home and well it's beats nothing, using my boost mobile phone connected to my pc
[09:54] <alkali> Anyone know when the new enlightenment will be released?
[09:54] <squidly> ndowens: lol ouch
[09:54] <squidly> alkali: is E17 stable and released yet?
[09:54] <alkali> squidly: that's what I was curious about
[09:55] <squidly> alkali: check the enlightnment website ^^ last time I checked itw as not
[09:55] <Ayabara> Is there a development channel or something for ubuntu, or should I just keep bugging people here to submit a patch to the kernel?
[09:55] <squidly> Ayabara: try the mailing lists
[09:55] <alkali> squidly: yea but it seems like it's not gonna be.  I got to play with it in vectorlinux and it was BEAUTIFUL
[09:55] <HeathenDan> does anyone here even have a say on the kernel?
[09:55] <n1gke> alkali, wow, did I have a mis-understanding with enlightenment, but I wish to try it again.....
[09:55] <squidly> that is how most distor deal with use submitted batches
[09:55] <crimsun> Ayabara: -devel is our development channel. -kernel is our kernel channel.
[09:56] <crimsun> HeathenDan: yes.
[09:56] <HeathenDan> ahh, besides you
[09:56] <Pizza> jordan: hm, I think it's not a problem of apt-get, but rather of the xorg-driver-fglrx package
[09:56] <squidly> alkali: i played with it a bit.. i didnt like it all that much
[09:56] <alkali> n1gke: e16 and e17 are two different creatures
[09:56] <HeathenDan> cause you come and go :p
[09:56] <crimsun> HeathenDan: well, yes. The "community" does.
[09:56] <squidly> n1gke: dog=e16 cat=e17
[09:56] <jamj> it's needed hardware acceleration to run compiz?
[09:56] <WindDragon> for the new adobe flash player for linux: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html
[09:56] <Ayabara> crimsun: ok. like I said I helped with a patch for dapper that is missing in edgy. maybe kernel is the right channel then?
[09:56] <alkali> squidly: it was so much less processor and memory intensive than anything else out right now and it was nice looking too
[09:56] <squidly> dog > cat ^^
[09:56] <squidly> alkali: try fluxbox
[09:57] <n1gke> brb, I need more coffee....
[09:57] <crimsun> Ayabara: the most efficient procedure is to file a bug against linux-source-2.6.17 and attach the patch
[09:57] <jordan> jamj: Yes.
[09:57] <squidly> memory foot print of less then 50k!
[09:57] <jamj> ok thxs
=== han3 is now known as hantu
[09:57] <Gurpartap> irrelevant question, how do i register an irc channel where i have missed to be an operator?
[09:57] <alkali> squidly: I'm a fan of me clicking on something and it running.  Gnome programs run in gnome.  KDE in KDE.  Some in fluxbox some not.
[09:57] <Ayabara> crimsun: problem is I don't remember the patch. all i did was describe it and test the solution when a good helper found it :-)
[09:58] <squidly> alkali: really? ive never had any problems with fluxbox
[09:58] <Ayabara> describe the problem, that is
[09:58] <Gurpartap> anyone?
[09:58] <xyzone> what package installs the "play" command?
[09:58] <HeathenDan> ./chanserv register #channame <-- i think
[09:58] <HeathenDan> you can try /chanserv help first
[09:58] <crimsun> Ayabara: and what problem is that?
[09:58] <squidly> HeathenDan: /msg chanserv iirc
[09:59] <hakrzcode> kikokos, your video is Matrox G250 8MB ram?
[09:59] <Gurpartap> HeathenDan: You are not a channel operator on [#channame] 
[09:59] <crimsun> Ayabara: do you have a prior bugzilla/launchpad bug #?
[09:59] <squidly> oh anyone got nvidia SLI working with ubuntu?
[09:59] <alkali> squidly: It's just that unless you have the library files for fluxbox for the program you want to run, it won't run
[09:59] <HeathenDan> ahh, yeah... it depends on the network
[09:59] <alkali> and I love gnomebaker
[09:59] <Gurpartap> HeathenDan: it also says: The channel [#channame]  is not registered
[09:59] <alkali> a lot
[09:59] <Gurpartap> its on freenode
[09:59] <squidly> alkali: that is an install issues
[09:59] <alkali> I'm all about some danishes!
[09:59] <squidly> lol
[10:00] <squidly> ahh blast forgot to install screen ><
[10:00] <sioux> who's calvino.freenode
[10:00] <Ayabara> crimsun: maybe. I don't know how the procedure is, but my email was registered. maybe it is possible to find it from that
[10:00] <HeathenDan> type /chanserv help register
[10:00] <squidly> sioux: iirc that is a freenode server
[10:00] <Gurpartap> ok
[10:01] <squidly> ok well im off to bed.. must get sleep
[10:01] <crimsun> Ayabara: ok, finding a needle in a haystack...
[10:01] <squidly> thanks everyone see you around
[10:01] <xyzone> no one knows how to play a sound from terminal?
[10:01] <saphrim> artsplay
[10:02] <hakrzcode> xyzone 'play /path/to/soundfile'
[10:02] <crimsun> xyzone: what type of sound?
[10:02] <sioux> squidly and what it wants to me?
[10:02] <crimsun> sound file, rather.
[10:02] <xyzone> hakrzcode, play is not installed
[10:02] <Ayabara> crimsun: ok. the problem is: on Dell Inspiron there is media keys on the front. When you plug in a headset, these keys should control headset volume instead of internal speaker volume. now they control internal speaker all the time.
[10:02] <xyzone> crimsun, wav, mp3, ogg
[10:02] <flasher> how do i kill a program?
[10:02] <craigermendel> join #/ubuntu
[10:02] <crimsun> Ayabara: "now" referring to Edgy?
[10:02] <flasher> if i don't know the program's PID?
[10:03] <ndowens> flasher: u can do killall PROG
[10:03] <saphrim> type 'ps ax'
[10:03] <flasher> ndowens: thanks
[10:03] <saphrim> and look for the pid
[10:03] <alkali> flasher: open a terminal type '"xkill" and click the program you want to stop.  Immediately.
[10:03] <crimsun> Ayabara: I've worked on millions of audio patches, so forgive me if I require more detail than that.
[10:03] <sioux> is it a way to see if there are some malitius code running in a ghost mode?
[10:03] <hakrzcode> xyzone: holdon.. forgot the package name.
[10:03] <flasher> alkali: i tried that but it didn't work
[10:03] <flasher> ndowens: that worked
[10:03] <flasher> thanks
[10:03] <ndowens> WC
[10:04] <alkali> try "killall (name of application)"
[10:04] <ndowens> sorry
[10:04] <ndowens> wc
[10:04] <flasher> what's wc?
[10:04] <hakrzcode> xyzone: install sox, and then do the above.
[10:04] <flasher> alkali: yes, that's what worked
[10:04] <gansinho> hello, there is how to change from openoffice to abiword as the default word processor?
[10:04] <ndowens> welcome
[10:04] <alkali> sorry I'm slow
[10:04] <xyzone> hakrzcode, sox, thanks
[10:04] <Ayabara> crimsun: "now"? I run edgy now, if thats what you ask. I'm not looking to find the previous patch, as long as it can be fixed again :-).
[10:04] <n1gke> !wc
[10:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about wc - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:04] <eliphas__> hello
[10:05] <hakrzcode> flasher: wc = word count. Really useful in scripts.
[10:05] <Ayabara> crimsun: ahh. now means edgy. it worked fine then, with "then" meaning dapper :-)
[10:06] <craigermendel> Anyone have time to guide me through an installation of RealPlayer in edgy?
[10:06] <alkali> I'm so mad. I want DR 17 to be finished
[10:06] <crimsun> Ayabara: ok, we seem to be livelocked here. I know approximately what you're referring to, but you need to provide either 1) a link to the patch for Dapper, or 2) your ``lspci -nv && tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat && amixer'' (use pastebin)
[10:06] <xyzone> does anyone here use hardware midi on emu10kx (sound blaster etc)? midi is channels are being mixed on the right side only
[10:06] <zic> i have a problem with a theme, i downloded from gnome-look beryl theme and when i hit the install button it says that the format is invalid
[10:07] <Simian__> where is loopback stored
[10:07] <cryptonic> has anyone got wengophone 2.0 working on ubuntu?
[10:07] <ademan> !ipv6
[10:07] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[10:07] <kees-jan> Hi
[10:07] <zic> i have a problem with a theme, i downloded from gnome-look beryl theme and when i hit the install button it says that the format is invalid. the file format is tar.gz
[10:08] <Ayabara> !pastebin
[10:08] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[10:08] <zic> anyone can help me please?
[10:08] <ademan> zic: if you're using the theme manager (system->preferences->theme) that is for metacity not compiz
[10:08] <zic> ademan: uh ok
[10:08] <ademan> zic: instead use system->preferences->emerald theme manager
[10:08] <err_> when i get kubuntu-desktop from synaptic package manager it asks me to insert my ubuntu install CD, how come? shouldn't I be able to download everything?
[10:08] <benny> hello :)
[10:09] <ademan> err_: totally, using the paste site can you show us your  /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[10:09] <scamboy> hello!!
[10:09] <Ayabara> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30137/
[10:09] <craigermendel> need some help installing a program
[10:09] <alkali> craigermendel: what program
[10:09] <err_> ademan, where do I find that last?
[10:09] <err_> ademan, list, sorry
[10:09] <benny> anybody ever uninstalled xorg-driver-flgrx !?
[10:10] <kikokos> hakrzcode yes my video card has 8 MB RAM
[10:10] <ademan> /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:10] <kikokos> alkali it didnt help me i did may instructyions from thsi page but nothing
[10:10] <ademan> new to ubuntu/linux ?
[10:10] <scamboy> jordan: i am downloading update now....is there a breezy +1??? coz it seems my breezy is 5.10 and its updating to another version before edgy..
[10:10] <crimsun> Ayabara: eh? I fixed that in Edgy.
[10:11] <crimsun> Ayabara: .type = AC97_TUNE_HP_MUTE_LED /* cf. Malone #41015 */
[10:11] <alkali> kikokos: they said later in the page it may be a bug in the program so there is currently no solution until they upgrade the program
[10:11] <Abnerian> *sigh* I managed to make a bootable USB key.
[10:11] <Abnerian> ...then I learned the awful truth.
[10:11] <Abnerian> Indeed, I have been struck by LILO.
[10:11] <kikokos> alkali but it is on my every video program...
[10:11] <kikokos> this is a bigbug?
[10:11] <Abnerian> I get L 99 99 99 99 99.
[10:12] <Abnerian> So
[10:12] <Abnerian> How the hell do I get rid of LILO?
[10:12] <Abnerian> Why does LILO even exist?
[10:12] <Abnerian> srsly
[10:12] <scamboy> !LILO
[10:12] <ubotu> lilo is an alternative [Li] nux Boot[Lo] ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.
[10:12] <alkali> I know.  Did you try re-installing new nvidia drivers?
[10:12] <c421> rs  temps
[10:12] <Ayabara> crimsun: is that a line of code?
[10:12] <hakrzcode> kikokos: have you tried to put the 8MB into your xorg.conf?
[10:12] <Abnerian> I know
[10:12] <Abnerian> I have LILO.
[10:12] <Abnerian> I want it gone.
[10:12] <Abnerian> As it L 99's at me.
[10:13] <scamboy> !find lilo
[10:13] <ubotu> Found: elilo, lilo, lilo-doc, lilo-config
[10:13] <Abnerian> And I can do absolutely nothing till it goes away
[10:13] <Abnerian> No, look
[10:13] <Abnerian> I have no working OS on that machin
[10:13] <kikokos> hakrzode no
[10:13] <Abnerian> e
[10:13] <Seeker2599> ok this is probably not the best place to ask this, but does anyone know of a good free avi splitter for windows besides avidemux?
[10:13] <crimsun> Ayabara: yes.
[10:13] <hakrzcode> aberian: apt-get remove --purge lilo && update-grub
[10:13] <scamboy> !uninstall lilo
[10:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about uninstall lilo - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:13] <Abnerian> This machine has no optical drive and no network connection. It has no OS.
[10:13] <xyzone> mkvtoolsnix Seeker2599
[10:13] <kikokos> hakrzcode x11/xorg,fiel -yes?
[10:14] <Abnerian> The only way to talk to it is via USB
[10:14] <saphrim> you may need to install a master boot record over lilo
[10:14] <Abnerian> how
[10:14] <kikokos> x11/xorg.file
[10:14] <saphrim> this can be dangerous
[10:14] <err_> ah i see, i had the cd listed as a repository
[10:14] <Abnerian> The drive has nothing valuable on it.
[10:14] <Seeker2599> thanks xyzone
[10:14] <Abnerian> just tell me how to get rid of LILO
[10:14] <err_> how do i switch between kubuntu and ubuntu, and will there be any problems having both on my machine?
[10:14] <Abnerian> i want an empty drive
[10:14] <craigermendel> is there a default password for su until you set one?
[10:14] <Abnerian> Just...empty.
[10:15] <Ayabara> crimsun: ok. it doesn't work here. "Master" is controlled all the time. If I remember right, the "Headphone" control disappeared after the patch was done in dapper. Anyway, I can live with it, but if you want to debug more I'm glad to help.
[10:15] <saphrim> do you have a dos disk?
[10:15] <Abnerian> No floppy disk, save for emulating one via USB stick
[10:15] <saphrim> it was at one time fdisk /mbr
[10:15] <saphrim> i think
[10:15] <Seeker2599> xyzone: do you have a site for that?
[10:15] <kikokos> hakrzcode I sent u on private info from my xorg.file
[10:15] <saphrim> and that would install lilo
[10:15] <saphrim> or uninstall
[10:16] <crimsun> Ayabara: the patch that I applied binds Master and Headphone into one control
[10:16] <ndowens> what kernel version does edgy come with
[10:16] <saphrim> but it replaces it with a dos boot loader instead
[10:16] <crimsun> Ayabara: are you using any additions to /etc/modprobe.d/* ?
[10:16] <andreas__> now I'm confused. xgl compiz/ Xgl Beryl / Beryl AIGLX ... what should I install?
[10:16] <xyzone> Seeker2599, if you have the universe/multiverse repos enabled try searching for mkv in the packages,
[10:16] <crimsun> ndowens: 2.6.17.13 + patches
[10:16] <benny> is it possible to remove the xorg-driver-fglrx !?!?
[10:16] <ndowens> ah
[10:16] <Ayabara> crimsun: don't know that it means, so probably not.
[10:17] <benny> is it possible to remove the xorg-driver-fglrx !?!?
[10:17] <scamboy> !find xorg
[10:17] <ubotu> Found: libglu1-xorg-dev, xorg, xorg-dev, xserver-xorg, xserver-xorg-core (and 77 others)
[10:18] <benny> it is not

[10:19] <Abnerian> saphrim: Where can I find a MS-DOS img file?
[10:20] <saphrim> it probably comes on a boot disk
[10:20] <saphrim> oh
[10:20] <capnPant1> hi everybody
[10:20] <saphrim> when you format a disk
[10:20] <saphrim> there's an option
[10:20] <Abnerian> Right click > Format > "Create MS-DOS boot disk" is greyed out
[10:20] <Abnerian> I know
[10:20] <Cypher> Abnerian: in every windows u can make boot flopy to maintain ur system
[10:20] <Abnerian> It's greyed out >.>
[10:20] <saphrim> no theres more than that
[10:20] <saphrim> because you need fdisk on the disk
[10:21] <john> how do you install mPlayer mozilla plugin in gNewSense?
[10:21] <Abnerian> I don't understand. I just want LILO gone.

[10:21] <crimsun> Ayabara: what make & model laptop?
[10:22] <jordan> scamboy: Sorry for the late response, It will upgrade you to Dapper first, then Edgy.
[10:22] <crimsun> ndowens: sorry, please rephrase your question

[10:22] <saphrim> but that will solve your problem
[10:22] <ndowens> crimsun: does edgy come with the kernel sources
[10:22] <Arafangion> How do I adjust the sound in KDE?
[10:22] <Abnerian> Thank you very much

[10:24] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about soundcard - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:24] <Abnerian> Ugh
[10:25] <Abnerian> I cannot get it to boot from USB
[10:25] <Abnerian> No matter what
[10:25] <ndowens> Arafangion: u can get alsa-mixer or use the speaker in the taskbar
[10:25] <cherubiel> !sound
[10:25] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[10:25] <Abnerian> It's set to boot "Removable device" first
[10:25] <Kengur> hi ppl
[10:25] <lenovox> hehe
[10:25] <Abnerian> but it just loads LILO
[10:26] <Kengur> can anyone help out with installation problem?
[10:26] <gansinho> ndowens, yes, I'm using gnome
[10:26] <UmbraAdmin> Abnerian dont you have to set that in bios
[10:26] <method|> why is adept updater requesting that i remove nvidia-glx?
[10:26] <ndowens> gansinho: go to desktop preferences and u will see a option for perfered applications
[10:26] <Arafangion> ndowens: I do not have a speaker on the taskbar.
[10:26] <scamboy> kengur ask
[10:27] <crimsun> Ayabara: ah, ouch
[10:27] <gansinho> ndowens, thanks a lot
[10:27] <Arafangion> ndowens: Additionally, alsamixer didn't change anything.
[10:27] <crimsun> Ayabara: looks like our kernel lead accidentally nuked my patch in Edgy when alsa-current was pulled in.
[10:27] <Kengur> i have nforce 3 sata drive that shows out as SCSI... i didn't have any problems with 6.06 (x64) but when i try 6.10 (x86) it shows no SCSI options (the 2 other when partititioning) and it doesn't find any hard drives
[10:27] <Ayabara> crimsun: would explain it :-)
[10:28] <saphrim> okay Abnerian
[10:28] <ndowens> Arafangion: sorry i don't have kde or i would tell u exactly where to go
[10:28] <saphrim> you need to direct the fdisk to the removable disk
[10:28] <Arafangion> ndowens: Well, how does Gnome manage to do it?
[10:28] <saphrim> because its probably booting lilo off the removable disk- is that possible?
[10:28] <ndowens> mine has a speaker
[10:28] <habeeb> Tried "emerald --replace" but X restarted and now its the same shit.
[10:28] <Abnerian> No
[10:28] <Arafangion> ndowens: So does mine
[10:28] <Abnerian> It's booting lilo off the HD
[10:28] <Cypher> kengur: man what distro did u downlaod
[10:29] <scamboy> scsi???
[10:29] <ndowens> Arafangion: then try and turn the volume up with it
[10:29] <saphrim> hmmm thats some pretty odd stuff
[10:29] <Arafangion> ndowens: I've only got the speaker in gnome :(
[10:29] <crimsun> Ayabara: this is the patch that restores Dapper's behavior: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2006-October/001088.html

[10:29] <Cypher> what lilo ubuntu uses Grub
[10:29] <Abnerian> LILO sucks.
[10:29] <Abnerian> It's awful.
[10:29] <Arafangion> Abnerian: It still has some advantages.
[10:29] <scamboy> !grub
[10:29] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[10:29] <Cypher> amen to that man
[10:30] <Abnerian> there is no advantage to the L 99 error
[10:30] <Abnerian> none
[10:30] <Kengur> scamboy: when chosing partitioning scheme it gives 3 options, the other 2 say scsi, so i assume it shows the drive as scsi, but it's a sata one
[10:30] <ndowens> Arafangion: right click on the speaker and open volume control
[10:30] <n1gke> This is so cool in Ubuntu. I have NO icons on the desktop whatsoever....
[10:30] <Cypher> grub is fine easy to use configure and stuff :))
[10:30] <Arafangion> ndowens: Which program provides the speaker?
[10:30] <Cypher> alsa drv
[10:30] <progek> Hello everyone, I am currently using gtkpod for placing songs onto my ipod. Does anyone know of a good app to place videos on my ipod?
[10:30] <Arafangion> Abnerian: Ubuntu's lilo support is crap, but it still has advantages.
[10:30] <scamboy> kengur: what u mean scsi???
[10:30] <drumline_> So is 6.10 really nice?
[10:31] <scamboy> drumline: no!!!
[10:31] <Cypher> it must be
[10:31] <manfred22> no, drumline_
[10:31] <manfred22> use debian
[10:31] <manfred22> !!
[10:31] <Cypher> its new and sparky
[10:31] <Arafangion> Abnerian: For starters, with grub, you /have/ to use ext3, and few other partition formats, and you cannot have your system live entirely on LVM, etc.
[10:31] <sn00p> has anybody tried to install ubuntu 6.10 amd64 yet?
[10:31] <Arafangion> sn00p: I'm sure someone, somewhere has.
[10:31] <drumline_> scamboy: ok.. I'll use debian
[10:31] <Ayabara> crimsun: ok. should I apply it myself or just wait for the patch. seem to recall a command line thingy that fixed it for me last time. you know how that oneliner would look?
[10:31] <Kengur> uh, there's ide and there's scsi drives, right?
[10:31] <Cypher> manfred22: debian is 14 CD !!!!!!!!!!!!
[10:31] <pgurumur> has anyone faced a problem like this on ubuntu "user not allowed because shell ::: does not exist" on a nis env?
[10:31] <manfred22> lol Cypher
[10:31] <Cypher> its akiller
[10:31] <Arafangion> Cypher: You don't ha -- Haha! :)
[10:31] <sn00p> Arafangion, well I have and it freezes
[10:31] <manfred22> Cypher, use network install
[10:31] <Cypher> all the gnu stuff in it
[10:31] <manfred22> 150 mb
[10:32] <manfred22> :p
[10:32] <lenovox> oh oh
[10:32] <Arafangion> Cypher: ALmsot tricked me :)
[10:32] <Abnerian> I think it's awful.
[10:32] <crimsun> Ayabara: you need: echo "options snd-intel8x0 ac97_quirk=hp_mute_led" |sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[10:32] <Abnerian> Seriously
[10:32] <Arafangion> Abnerian: How so?
[10:32] <Abnerian> It's so poorly designed
[10:32] <Arafangion> Abnerian: How so?
[10:32] <saphrim> heh
[10:32] <benny> just in case anybody needs it --> to fix the xorg-driver-fglrx problem just type "sudo mv /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.backup"
[10:32] <Abnerian> I actually had to DISABLE my hard drive to get LILO to relinquish it
[10:32] <benny> bye :)
[10:32] <Cypher> network intall is fine as long u have super Dsl man but with dail_up is pain full on me and my parents
[10:32] <sn00p> I cant even turn my laptop off when I booted my amd64 cd
[10:32] <progek> so, anyone know how I can place videos onto my ipod in ubuntu?
[10:32] <Arafangion> Abnerian: It can boot any kernel, for any OS, for any partition format, on x86
[10:33] <Arafangion> Abnerian: Grub can boot, perhaps 2.
[10:33] <bismark> some knows how can i install this : http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=17463&forummode=2&forumpage=17&forumexplevel=99
[10:33] <Abnerian> I have x64.
[10:33] <Ayabara> crimsun: and then I reload some module?
[10:33] <Arafangion> Abnerian: Maybe more.
[10:33] <Abnerian> well
[10:33] <Abnerian> I suppose, then, you have more than two OSes on one machine?
[10:33] <Cypher> manfred22 after finshing i might sell my computer to pay the phone bill
[10:33] <sn00p> Abnerian, have you installed it?
[10:33] <crimsun> Ayabara: or reboot, whichever's easier.
[10:33] <Abnerian> i am trying to get rid of it at the moment
[10:33] <Arafangion> Abnerian: How about ONE OS, using LVM?
=== xTERMiNATOR is now known as alanhaggai_
[10:33] <Ayabara> crimsun: ok. thanks a lot for helping out. :-)
[10:34] <Abnerian> I generally have one OS per machine.
[10:34] <Arafangion> Abnerian: How about ONE OS, using LVM?
[10:34] <Abnerian> I like to keep a Linux, an OSX, and a Windows machine about.
[10:34] <linopil> kengur cheer up
[10:34] <Arafangion> Abnerian: Hello?!? You there?
[10:34] <Abnerian> nah
[10:34] <saphrim> he's getting the lilo error too
[10:34] <sn00p> amd64
[10:34] <Abnerian> lol lilo
[10:34] <scamboy> snoop: cheer up8-)
[10:34] <saphrim> it gets that under a few sits specifically when the kernel image is too big?
[10:35] <sn00p> I cant shutdown the laptop or reboot it
[10:35] <Cypher> crimsun: u know whats lvm
[10:35] <Abnerian> have you tried holding the power button down?
[10:35] <Abnerian> Or, at least, yanking the battery?
[10:35] <crimsun> Cypher: roughly, yes. I'm not a storage guru.
[10:35] <Arafangion> Cypher: Logical Volume Manager.  Basically you can stripe your paritions across multiple partitions/devices, including your USB stick, and resize partitions.
[10:36] <sn00p> there I just removed the battery
[10:36] <Arafangion> Cypher: Without rebooting or even taking your system offline.  You can also snapshot your filesystem as well.
[10:36] <Crazed> hrm
[10:36] <Kengur> darn
[10:36] <Crazed> any ppl here who upgraded from dapper to edgy ?

[10:37] <JvA> Hi! Someone here who knows if the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (the one for AMD64) supports both 32-bit and 64-bit software?
[10:37] <benny> Crazed: but I'm no ppl, o_o sorry, didn't see that
[10:37] <Kengur> anyone familiar with this sata emulation via scsi??? i did work fine in previous ubuntu release and now it's broke =(
[10:37] <Cypher> crimsun : just want to make sure cus there is an article in linux world
[10:38] <Cypher> nice one
[10:38] <kees-jan> I'm trying to update packages in edgy. First a window pops up suggesting I do a distribution upgrade. Then there is a popup "Could not calculate the upgrade" suggesting I file a bug report. What information should be included in the bug report?
[10:38] <crimsun> Kengur: sata emulation ... via scsi? What are you really referring to?
[10:38] <benny> Crazed: I'm here cause I dont know how to exit irsii
[10:38] <sn00p> amd64 boot cd still screws up on my laptop
[10:38] <benny> Crazed: Never used it before
[10:38] <JvA> sn00p: I've had bad experience in the past with AMD64-versions of Ubuntu, and that's why I ask.
[10:38] <scamboy> kengur: sorry....i not good in that......:(
[10:38] <Kengur> JvA: certain things don't work out of the box
[10:39] <sn00p> jv4 it doesn't even boot to the desktop livecd
[10:39] <JvA> Kengur: Ok, I'll stick to 32-bit then. Thanks :)

[10:43] <Crazed> I can't upgrade :P
[10:43] <bibe> hi all. I looked, with no success, for a nice explanation of how upstart (the new init for Edgy) works. I'd like to know how to symlink netenv (a package for managing different network profiles, it's in "universe") to make networking work after booting with NETENV=myprofile kernel parameter
[10:43] <Crazed> An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.

[10:52] <jordan> atarinox: top
[10:52] <bibe> atarinox : top
[10:52] <Abnerian> it L 99's
[10:52] <markus_> run "top" in a terminal window

[10:52] <ifireball> napander: the "top" command might give you a clue
[10:53] <atarinox> in top, is the %us the total cpu usage?

[10:55] <scamboy> abnerian: wat u want to do??
[10:55] <Abnerian> LILO won't relinquish control of my hard drive.
[10:55] <Abnerian> I'm gonna use a friend's PC to format it.
[10:55] <jordan> Abnerian: LILO has nothing to do with it, set your bios to boot from USB
[10:56] <Abnerian> I did.
[10:56] <scamboy> abnerian: u can use linux cd to do that
[10:56] <Abnerian> It should do that.
[10:56] <Abnerian> But
[10:56] <Abnerian> It's not.
[10:56] <Abnerian> weird.
[10:56] <Abnerian> LILO has possessed my computer.

[10:58] <jordan> Abnerian: Really, it has nothing to do with LILO, when the BIOS fails to boot from the thumb drive ( for whatever reason ) it boots from the HDD
[10:58] <markus_> cameleondesk: what's the problem?
[10:58] <zendainc> hi i dont suppose anyone could tell me how i can connect to the internet through my windows network on ubunut
[10:58] <cameleondesk> i connected another harddrive
[10:58] <cameleondesk> and i cant view it
[10:58] <ifireball> zendainc: you have windows connection sharing?
[10:58] <Abnerian> LILO is clearly out to get me.
[10:59] <Abnerian> it attacked my BIOS while they were sleeping
[10:59] <scamboy> abnerian: chill ma' man..
[10:59] <zendainc> what u mean ifireball
[10:59] <Abnerian> heh
[10:59] <markus_> cameleondesk: you need to mount the drive before you can view it
[10:59] <cameleondesk> it shows only in device manager
[10:59] <PiPak> hello, I have a little problem to install ubuntu from another distribution with the package initramfs-tools. It says "Unpacking initramfs-tools (from ../initramfs-tools_0.69ubuntu20_all.deb) ... : error opening volume" :(
[10:59] <Abnerian> LILO cloned my bios and killed the original off.
[10:59] <Vigzilla> zendiac: I have a site that explains that, if you want,its just the basic DNS and stuff...
[10:59] <cameleondesk> so how do i do that
[10:59] <Abnerian> Only my CMOS remains to fight against the menace.
[10:59] <zendainc> vigzilla: yea it would help
[10:59] <Abnerian> My CMOS: "I am not a number! ...I am a free man!".
[11:00] <jordan> Abnerian: We need to figure out why the thumb drive isn't bootable
[11:00] <ifireball> zendainc: I mean, do you have one windows machine which connects to the internet and the rest are connecting through it?
[11:00] <Abnerian> the thumb drive is bootable
[11:00] <Abnerian> my machine won't boot it
[11:00] <cameleondesk> but before i had linux running on it was perfect
[11:00] <linopil> abnerian you are definitely trolling now !!
[11:00] <scamboy> yeah..probably the bios..
[11:00] <Abnerian> How so?
[11:00] <jordan> Abnerian: How do you know it's bootable?
[11:00] <Abnerian> I'm joking
[11:00] <Abnerian> Not trolling
[11:00] <zendainc> ifireball: no they all connect to the internet through a router connected to a modem
[11:00] <Abnerian> It booted in this computer just fine
[11:00] <scamboy> joker:-P
[11:00] <cameleondesk> and now its a slave drive,now master
[11:01] <UmbraAdmin> Abnerian check the bios settings
[11:01] <Abnerian> i did
[11:01] <willwork4foo> is anyone here any good with synce stuff? I'm trying to sync my PDA with my Ubuntu laptop via USB, and I'm having problems. I've been following this howto: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Pocket_PC_Evolution
[11:01] <UmbraAdmin> ok
[11:01] <Abnerian> Laptop BIOS suck.
[11:01] <UmbraAdmin> lol
[11:01] <willwork4foo> can anyone help me here?
[11:01] <jordan> Abnerian: But it doesn't boot anymore?
[11:01] <KenSentMe> Is there a system sound for new mail somewhere in ubuntu?
[11:01] <rob> Abnerian: please cut it out
[11:01] <ifireball> zendainc: and I suppose you can just plug a windows computer in and it gets the config automatically from the router right?
[11:01] <scamboy> will: only palm can
[11:01] <Abnerian> It'll boot. It's running Hiren's Killdisk at the moment.
[11:01] <Abnerian> I hope it stays up.
[11:01] <willwork4foo> I've got as far as running "synce-matchmaker create 2"
[11:01] <linopil> Abnerian: see my point ?
[11:01] <zendainc> ifireball: yea i guess lol, i jsut plug the cord in and it works on windows
[11:01] <Abnerian> no i do not
[11:01] <willwork4foo> and I get the error message [synce_info_from_file:51]  unable to open file: /home/bjdemora/.synce/active_connection
[11:02] <Abnerian> You're in LEAGUE with THEM, aren't you?
[11:02] <linopil> too bad Abnerian
[11:02] <Abnerian> Help! LILO is attacking me!
[11:02] <KenSentMe> willwork4foo: what problems do you have?
[11:02] <markus_> hey, guys, shouldn't ubuntu detect cameleondesk's hard drive on boot?
[11:02] <jordan> Abnerian: If it will boot then I don't see the problem, why didn't you just install Ubuntu?
[11:02] <rob> sigh..
[11:02] <scamboy> abnerian: yup!!
[11:02] <willwork4foo> KenSentMe: I just said - I'm getting an error message when trying to run synce-matchmaker create 2
[11:02] <cameleondesk> it doesnt detect
[11:03] <ifireball> zendainc: it ususally works the same way on ubuntu, unless you palyed around wtih the network settings, try to configure your network card to use "DHCP" in System->Administration->Networking
[11:03] <zendainc> k thanks
[11:03] <cameleondesk> i can see it on device manager and on Gparted
[11:03] <jordan> Abnerian: If it will boot then I don't see the problem, why didn't you just install Ubuntu?
[11:03] <rob> jordan: he is just trolling
[11:03] <willwork4foo> KenSentMe: I get the error: [synce_info_from_file:51]  unable to open file: /home/bjdemora/.synce/active_connection
[11:04] <KenSentMe> willwork4foo: just install gnome-pilot package and in Evolution go to Sync options
[11:04] <willwork4foo> KenSentMe: will that solve the problem?
[11:04] <KenSentMe> willwork4foo: you don't need to install things by hand
[11:04] <crimsun> damageDOne: your emu10k1 is sharing an irq with several other devices. Are you able to physically move it to another pci slot?
[11:04] <willwork4foo> KenSentMe: bear in mind - this is NOT a palm pilot, this is a Windows Pocket PC
[11:04] <jordan> rob: I have helped him out before , his installing is a legitamite problem, I don't know why is acting this way now but troll or not he has a real problem
[11:05] <KenSentMe> willwork4foo: ah, maybe that makes a difference
[11:05] <damageDOne> crimsun: Okay what's my emu10k1? I can see if I have another slot available.
[11:05] <rob> jordan: maybe, but he was warned
[11:05] <crimsun> damageDOne: it's your sound card.
[11:05] <scamboy> willwork4foo: windows for windows......domination hehehehe
[11:05] <damageDOne> crimsun: okay :)

[11:06] <willwork4foo> KenSentMe: thanks I'll take a look
[11:06] <KenSentMe> willwork4foo: maybe it helps you, but i don't know anything about syncing with pocket pc
[11:06] <scamboy> willwork4foo: dun woory.....the expertS here will help u....believe me...
[11:06] <damageDOne> crimsun: I do have one spare slot
[11:07] <andy> hi, i have a problem with bash completion in edgy
[11:07] <jordan> rob: I am really very interested in knowing why it didn't work, for my own curiosity if nothing else, shame he wants to be this way
[11:07] <rob> jordan: yep
[11:07] <jordan> bye
[11:07] <scamboy> andy: welcome to edgy...the problemactic os...
[11:07] <andy> some completions work, but some don't
[11:07] <damageDOne> crimsun: I guess I'll talk to you again in a few minutes after I've rebooted.
[11:08] <gm> I never cant seem to connect to ZIRC network. Any ideas why please?
[11:08] <andy> hostname completion in ssh is broken
[11:08] <andy> when i type "ssh [TAB] "
[11:08] <andy> i get "ssh |1|" and that's it
[11:08] <andy> any ideas what is wrong?
[11:09] <markus_> cameleondesk: run "mount /dev/hda2 /media/newdrive", but replace "/dev/hda2" with the block.device entry from device manager
[11:09] <andy> scamboy: example? so far i had no trouble...
[11:09] <alesdoc> Hi. I've a video file and separetely the subtitles file. How can i """attach""" the subtitlen on the video file so i can burn it and play on the dvd-player?
[11:11] <willwork4foo> OK - this is getting frustrating - when I unplug and plug in my PDA now, I get the "Connecting to host" message appearing on my PDA for a few moments, before it dissappearing and no connection being made
[11:11] <ifireball> alesdoc: the tool for the job is "mencoder" which is part of the "mplayer" pacjages, I don't remeber the details however this should give you engouh information to search a HOWTO on the web
[11:11] <PiPak> Don't take my question as being spam: I have a little problem to install ubuntu from another distribution with the package initramfs-tools. It says "Unpacking initramfs-tools (from ../initramfs-tools_0.69ubuntu20_all.deb) ... : error opening volume". I couldn't find any option on dpkg to make it more verbose. The .deb file seems to be fine as I could extract it.
[11:11] <scamboy> andy: i hav no experience on edgy..'
[11:11] <mseve> dnite: lo o/
[11:11] <cpk1> alesdoc: I dunno, maybe subtitleeditor will do that?
[11:11] <willwork4foo> does ANYONE here actually know about syncing PocketPC PDAs with Ubuntu??
[11:12] <alesdoc> ifireball cpk1 thanks i will try both
[11:12] <ifireball> alesdoc: I mean package*
[11:12] <ademan> !ipv6
[11:12] <ubotu> To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
[11:12] <mseve> I sync my Sony Clie (Palm OS 5) with Ubuntu easier then I could in Windows.
[11:12] <klaas> I got a weird problem, I have a snd_intel_hda and it only works from time to time ... - if I use the function keys (volume up/down, mute/unmute) it suddently stops working and will only work again after a reboot
[11:12] <alesdoc> ifireball: i love menconder.....but i didn't know the function of it
[11:13] <cpk1> ifireball: mencoder is so horribly confusing with its syntax and all the possible arguments you can have for it though heh
[11:13] <klaas> its a new asus a8js if that is important
[11:13] <boybach> morning people.
[11:13] <mseve> dnite: Wake up. =)
[11:13] <klaas> I tried using different model parameters for the snd module
[11:13] <scamboy> boybacH;evening in asia
[11:14] <ifireball> cpk1: with power comes complexity... anyway, man reading skills...
[11:14] <boybach> scamboy: evening then lol.
[11:14] <Cypher> ubuntu is like debian light
[11:14] <mseve> lo lo boybach
[11:14] <willwork4foo> does ANYONE here actually know about syncing PocketPC PDAs with Ubuntu??
[11:14] <Cypher> debian JR
[11:14] <rob> Cypher: based on debian
[11:14] <rob> Cypher: its not Debian Jr
[11:15] <Cypher> i kno that
[11:15] <Cypher> still is good to use debian with out the 14cd
[11:15] <willwork4foo> does ANYONE here actually know about syncing PocketPC PDAs with Ubuntu?? I have been trying with this problem for days now with very little success, and could use a bit of help if there is anyone out there who can assist
[11:15] <xyzone> who needs all that stuff anyways, for a desktop
[11:15] <drumline_> what's the link to ubuntu's site where they describe the rational behind leaving out the ugly formats from the distro?
[11:15] <Cypher> true
[11:16] <cameleondesk> markus_... what does mount exactly mean?
[11:16] <boybach> wonder if anyone can help, I want to listen to my local radio station on my computer but it uses windows media player for streaming. am I able to get around this ?
[11:16] <ifireball> willwork4foo: nothing about this on the wiki? this has potential to be a popular enough problem...
[11:16] <willwork4foo> ifireball: nothing that I can find
[11:17] <Vigzilla> boybach: use RealPlayer in w!ndoze, it works better and I am listening to a stream now.
[11:17] <mseve> willwork4foo: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=30936
[11:17] <rob> Cypher: Ubuntu only concentrates on specific archatechures and a limited package set, x[C[C[C[Debian support everything under the sun almost
[11:18] <KenSentMe> Is there a system sound for new mail somewhere in ubuntu?
[11:18] <rob> s/archatechures/architectures
[11:18] <zendainc> ifireball: how do i make it do what you said,
[11:18] <boybach> Vigzilla: on ubuntu
[11:18] <boybach> ?
[11:18] <fredo> je veux mont un rep windows sur mon xfce ?????????????? en ligne de commandes de prfrences ;-) !!

[11:18] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[11:18] <ifireball> boybach: you can install mplayer and mplayerplugin it can ususally impersonate WMP well enough that sites don't notice the difference
[11:19] <Vigzilla> boybcach: Not yet, but once there, I will use Wine to interoperate that,,,,I think?
[11:19] <ifireball> zendainc: remind me, what did I say?
[11:19] <boybach> ifireball: ok thanks
[11:19] <zendainc> ifireball: about making it use DNCP i think you said?
[11:19] <zendainc> ifireball: its to connect to the internet over my windows lan
[11:20] <cameleondesk> this is what i got mount: can't find /dev/hdd/media/newdrive in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[11:20] <capitalidea> For some reason, OpenGL screensavers want to use visual 0x24, and xscreensaver-gl-helper says they should use visual 0x27
[11:20] <boybach> kmplayer is that the one ?
[11:20] <ifireball> zendainc: it didn't "just work" ?
[11:20] <capitalidea> Is there some way I can pass the visual to gnomescreensaver?
[11:20] <willwork4foo> wait..
[11:20] <zendainc> ifireball: nope it says it is connected to "lo" which seems to be itself
[11:20] <willwork4foo> it WORKS!!!!!!!!!
[11:20] <willwork4foo> YES!
[11:21] <zendainc> ifireball: but no internet
[11:21] <ifireball> zendainc: we're talking wired connection here?
[11:21] <damageDOne> crimsun: I'm back. I've changed the slot but still have the same sound problem so far.
[11:21] <willwork4foo> now all I need to do is script this so that everything happens automatically when I plug in the PDA
[11:21] <willwork4foo> hmm
[11:21] <zendainc> ifireball: yea no wireless or anything, using standard blue network cord
[11:21] <crimsun> damageDOne: is it reproducible using a live cd ? how about another OS?
[11:21] <mseve> willwork4foo: I'm glad I could help. =)
[11:22] <benny> hello, gdm doesn't start because it can't find any useable theme... what's wrong ?
[11:22] <ifireball> zendainc: when you go into System->Administration->Networking do you see the card there? (e.g. "Wired Connection")
[11:22] <zendainc> ifireball: no only wireless connection and modem
[11:22] <benny> can I install a standard-theme manually ?
[11:22] <damageDOne> crimsun: I'm not sure. I can try I have knoppix and ubuntu live DVDs. I can give it a shot.
[11:23] <sidewalk`> how do i start the filemanager in default ubuntu?
[11:23] <sidewalk`> whats the commandline for it?

[11:23] <sidewalk`> ahh tnx
[11:24] <ch_> irc.crucial-x.net/cx-allmp3s
[11:24] <ifireball> zendainc: you may be out of luck, card may be unsupported, is it a USB card? PCMCIA? onboard?
[11:24] <mseve> later n1gke
[11:24] <zendainc> ifireball: its onboard
[11:25] <PiPak> Don't take my question as being spam: I have a little problem to install ubuntu from another distribution with the package initramfs-tools.

[11:26] <devin> ?
[11:27] <ekimus> hello, where do i set the number of ttys? i thought it was inittab but that file doesn't exist in edgy
[11:27] <drumline_> delete the package... make it download it again.
[11:27] <Tinned_Tuna> heya
[11:27] <drumline_> /var/cache/apt/archives is where the packages are
[11:28] <Tinned_Tuna> has anyone got M$ Office Basic Edition 2003 Working under Wine 0.9.9/Xubuntu 6.06 LTS ?
[11:28] <ekimus> devin:  dpk -C and do what it says....
[11:28] <zendainc> ifireball: im actually runnin irc on one of my windows computers so i cant really paste it in their, is there something specific i should look for
[11:29] <drumline_> Tinned_Tuna: curious... what do you need from O2k3 Basic?
[11:29] <Tinned_Tuna> drumline_ I need Excel
[11:29] <Tinned_Tuna> the excel files I use have macros :'(
[11:29] <drumline_> Tinned_Tuna: ahh... special formulas & macros?
[11:29] <boink> dpkg -C .. thanks for the ip
[11:29] <boink> tip, dang keyboard
[11:29] <Tinned_Tuna> yea, it sucks arse
[11:29] <drumline_> Tinned_Tuna: have you tried OOo 2.0.4 ?
[11:30] <Tinned_Tuna> it doesn't support the macros, does it?
[11:30] <boink> who knows, try it
[11:30] <drumline_> Tinned_Tuna: They've added a whole lot more macro support... I'd try it.  :)
[11:30] <abo> Tinned_Tuna... unfortunately no...
[11:30] <ifireball> zendainc: right no network there... my bad... you should look for your network card, see of Linux can recognise the make and model
[11:30] <Tinned_Tuna> I'd like to use OOo, but i have no real idea how to get at the macros/scripting in it :/
[11:30] <zendainc> ifireball: okay ill look now
[11:30] <boink> I don't think there's much of a difference, Tuna
[11:31] <boink> just try it
[11:31] <Tinned_Tuna> + i've already started writing my project, and I'm around 60% of the wa there... all in Excel, i wish the school comps would use something better...
[11:31] <Vigzilla> Will the Wine do an Auto Resolve of DNS or is that allready included?
[11:31] <Tinned_Tuna> the school claims open source isn't 'reliable enough'
[11:31] <boink> they've never used it
[11:31] <drumline_> Tinned_Tuna: be sure to try 2.0.4
[11:31] <boink> that's typical M$oft speak
[11:31] <Tinned_Tuna> when I say that around 60 - 70% of the internet runs open source they just think I'm crazy and tell me to go away :'(
[11:31] <ifireball> zendainc: you should see something like "0000:00:13.0 Ethernet controller: <make, model, etc.>"
[11:31] <boink> anyway, depending on your macro .. your odds are 50-50
[11:31] <Tinned_Tuna> ok I'll see if I can get it working under OOo
[11:32] <Tinned_Tuna> boink: most of my macros are hand written in VBa
[11:32] <drumline_> Anyone else here felt a disturbance in their stomach upon hearing the Novell-MS news?
[11:32] <Tinned_Tuna> with UserForms
[11:32] <ekimus> how do I set the number of TTYs in edgy? - I always did it in /etc/inittab but that doesn't exist. (sorry for double posting)
[11:32] <Tinned_Tuna> drumline_ I went and had a good vomit
[11:32] <grant> hey guys could do with some help here please, running edgy with nvidia car, just installed beryl, when i try to run it the system becomes unresponsive, had to do a hard reset, not my virtual desktop manager is gone and my mouse point has changed back to the original one and the minimize/maximize/close buttons are gone off all my windows, thanks for your help

[11:35] <grant> ok thanks
[11:35] <boink> though, you could install 32-bit ubuntu on a 64 bit system. that would work
[11:35] <elfreakz> apokryphos: how do my laptop recognise to start which os at that time?
[11:35] <drumline_> you could live without it, but I wouldn't recommend it.
[11:35] <jmspeex> boink: For me it takes 3x longer to boot, X does all kinds of funny things and the whole thing generally crashes in a matter of minutes. I've got a Dell D820 w/ Core 2 Duo
[11:35] <apokryphos> elfreakz: dual-booting. When you restart, it'll ask you which one you want to go into
[11:35] <boink> which ubuntu?
[11:35] <drumline_> elfreakz: it offers an OS selection screen.
[11:36] <elfreakz> apokryphos: that will auto ask is it? or i need to set anything?
[11:36] <ifireball> zendainc: the "accsess denied" thing doesn't mean a thing, don't worry about it
[11:36] <apokryphos> elfreakz: it will auto-ask, on every restart. It has like a 6 second timeout
[11:36] <jmspeex> boink: Edgy amd64 is totally broken, but Edgy i386 works.
[11:36] <boink> use edgy i386 then
[11:37] <KenSentMe> Is there a 'New Mail' sound that comes with Evolution?
[11:37] <apokryphos> jmspeex: errm, in what way?
[11:37] <sidewalk`> i installed captive (ntfs)
[11:37] <elfreakz> apokryphos: so now i just need to insert the CD, then boot up.. and it will auto resize my windows xp C:/ files?
[11:37] <boink> 64 bit desktop is still not there, I suppose
[11:37] <xyzone> all 64 bit OSes are generally broken
[11:37] <sidewalk`> and i cant chmod, chgrp och chown files
[11:37] <drumline_> elfreakz: one important thing to do.  Whenever you do major changes to your computer, you always want to back up the computer.  You, of course, want to backup periodically, but especially before a major change.
[11:37] <xyzone> -desktop OSes
[11:37] <apokryphos> elfreakz: autoresize your partition while preserving those files, yes it should. But pay attention to the details before you commit, just in case something goes wrong.
[11:37] <boink> give it a few years, then the transition to 64 bit will be more mainstream
[11:37] <apokryphos> xyzone: rubbish
[11:37] <porkpie> guy's...any ideas root@Radius:~/v2.0.2/freeradius/freeradius-1.1.0# ./configure
[11:37] <porkpie> loading cache ./config.cache
[11:37] <porkpie> checking for gcc... gcc
[11:37] <porkpie> checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
[11:37] <porkpie> configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot create executables.
[11:37] <boink> !pastebin
[11:37] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)
[11:37] <zendainc> ifireball: well it also says in subsytem "LG electronics, Inc. Unknown Device 0059"
[11:38] <zendainc> does that mean anything
[11:38] <jmspeex> apokryphos: As in I can't click on a button without hanging the X server and the whole system crashes after a few minutes.
[11:38] <porkpie> sorry
[11:38] <cherubiel> porkpie: apt-get install build-essential
[11:38] <apokryphos> porkpie: no pasting in here. Please read the FAQ first, regarding your question.
=== sjoerd_ is now known as sjoerd
[11:38] <elfreakz> apokryphos: how if i make another partition myself, and install ubuntu in it? will that safe?
[11:38] <apokryphos> jmspeex: that's a problem *for you*, not all builds.
[11:38] <boink> apt-cache search freeradius as well
[11:38] <apokryphos> elfreakz: sure, but it should do all of this fine automatically.
[11:38] <jmspeex> apokryphos, boink: I've put all the details here: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/66500 but nobody seems interested so far.
[11:39] <apokryphos> jmspeex: there's countless people in here who don't have problems with the amd64 install (namely, me)
[11:39] <boink> or nobody knows
[11:39] <elfreakz> apokryphos: making my own partition of ubuntu, do i still need to backup everything in C:/ ?? C:/ wont be disturb?
[11:39] <jmspeex> apokryphos: For me and presumably everyone who buys a new Dell laptop...
[11:39] <ekimus> drumline_:  as long as xen is gpl that is just bad news for MS, if they use a GPLd software they will have to play the game by the rules of gpl (imho)
[11:39] <boink> like there isn't flash for 64 bit, right?
[11:39] <apokryphos> elfreakz: presuming you have enough free space on the partition, it should be fine. Backups are always a good idea though.
[11:39] <jmspeex> apokryphos: So because it works for you there's no bug in the amd64 build?
[11:39] <cherubiel> elfreakz: you should try the gparted live cd, non-destructive and works like a charm
[11:39] <boink> I had to install some debian .debs for the 64-bit w32codecs stuff
[11:40] <mseve> Later all....
[11:40] <ifireball> zendainc: it might mean there is something on your borad Linux can't recognise, but its probably unrelated to the network card since as you're telling me you can see it in lspci, so, what does is say after "etehrnet controller:" ?
[11:40] <AlanHaggai> where is apache config file stored in Ubuntu?
[11:40] <hangy> boink: no, unfortunately not. - it seems to work with nspluginwrapper, but it's weird ..
[11:40] <capitalidea> jmspeex: I have a few problems but not with the actual install process
[11:40] <xyzone> if you don't have problem with amd64 ubuntu you don't use anything that doesn't mean the same things will work as the 32bit version
[11:40] <elfreakz> apokryphos: im so afraid during ubuntu installing it delete my WINDOWS folder and everything related to windows.. sorry im a noob
[11:40] <apokryphos> jmspeex: I didn't say there was no bug, I said it's totally erroneous to presuppose that amd64 is "totally broken" because either (i) there's a genuine bug in there, that you're experiening (ii) you had problems with it.
[11:40] <ifireball> AlanHaggai: there are quite a few of those in /etc/apache2
[11:40] <PiPak> Don't take my question as being spam: I have a little problem to install ubuntu from another distribution with the package initramfs-tools. It says "Unpacking initramfs-tools (from ../initramfs-tools_0.69ubuntu20_all.deb) ... : error opening volume". It looks like the pre-installation scripts are missing. My question is, how are they generated?
[11:40] <jmspeex> capitalidea: The actual install was a bit of a pain, but managed to work. The problem is that the result is totally unstable.
[11:40] <crimsun> jmspeex: it's a combination of resource constraint and debugging upstream.
[11:40] <apokryphos> elfreakz: as I said, backups are always a good idea.
[11:41] <zendainc> ifireball: its says "Agere Systems ET-131x PCI-E Ethernet Controller (re v 02)"
[11:41] <jmspeex> apokryphos: I said totally broken [on my system] 
[11:41] <capitalidea> jmspeex: it is prone to crashing alot?
[11:41] <elfreakz> apokryphos: any critical info i should do before having a dual-os?
[11:41] <Tinned_Tuna> also, where can I file bug reports for WiFi Drivers, mine doesn't seem to like connecting to my WEP-Open network...
[11:41] <crimsun> jmspeex: the entire kernel team is headed to the developer conference, so I wouldn't expect any real movement until they return. In the meantime, you can confirm with newer upstream (kernel.org) kernels.
[11:41] <jmspeex> capitalidea: It generally crashes after a few minutes and it's not really usable even when it's not crashed.
[11:42] <apokryphos> elfreakz: probably the majority of people in here are dual-booting :)
[11:42] <boink> which ubuntu? the gnome one?
[11:42] <xyzone> I run regular ubuntu on amd64 machine, no problems here, and it's fast
[11:42] <apokryphos> jmspeex: alrighty, my apologies. Only saw your last post.
[11:42] <boink> maybe you could try kubuntu or xubuntu as well
[11:42] <Tinned_Tuna> apokryphos: not this ginger nerd ;)
[11:42] <capitalidea> Which gpu is inside it jmspeex ?
[11:42] <jmspeex> crimsun: I actually posted the bug before the Edgy RC.
[11:42] <apokryphos> Tinned_Tuna: sorry?
[11:42] <ifireball> zendainc: ok, lets try something, type "ifconfig" in the terminal and tell me if it gives you a line that begins with "eth0"
[11:42] <jmspeex> capitalidea: intel 950
[11:42] <Tinned_Tuna> lol, I'm not dual booting
[11:42] <elfreakz> apokryphos: so backup my C:/ only will be the work i need to do right?
[11:42] <crimsun> jmspeex: I realize that.
[11:42] <apokryphos> Tinned_Tuna: I'm tri-booting :)
[11:42] <apokryphos> elfreakz: I recommend it, yes.
[11:43] <scamboy> zzzzzzz....................
[11:43] <Tinned_Tuna> lol
[11:43] <elfreakz> apokryphos: ok now i want to know.. ubuntu will also be in my C: drive or other?
[11:43] <apokryphos> Tinned_Tuna: no Windows though =)
[11:43] <Tinned_Tuna> =)
[11:43] <capitalidea> jmspeex: ah, lucky you, should you be able to figure out this instability junk you will have a good time with aiglx (and any extra stuff if you're into that)
[11:43] <jmspeex> crimsun: resiously, how many people are actually fixing things. Most (all?) of the stuff I reported for Dapper is still not fixed.
[11:43] <apokryphos> elfreakz: it will create a seperate partition, and put Ubuntu on there.
[11:43] <AlanHaggai> thanks ifireball :)
[11:43] <elfreakz> apokryphos: aaaa ic ic
[11:43] <elfreakz> apokryphos: thanks mate
[11:43] <Tinned_Tuna> I'm planning my network now... I have XUbuntu laptop, PowerBook, 2 iMacs, my Dad's Windows Sony Vaio laptop
[11:44] <Tinned_Tuna> and hopefully, a server soon :D
[11:44] <jmspeex> capitalidea: Edgy i386 works fine, so I may try it someday.
[11:44] <capitalidea> jmspeex: does it hard lock or reboot?
[11:44] <crimsun> jmspeex: what "things"? I can't speak on behalf of paid canonical employees (I'm not one)
[11:44] <cntb> elfreakz: keep a connectd pC to this room  ;-)
[11:44] <jmspeex> capitalidea: It doesn't reboot. Can't say whether it panics, hangs, whatever.
[11:44] <elfreakz> im using bluetooth over the mobile for internet, and i use the same method over ubuntu?
[11:44] <zendainc> ifireball: no no line starts with eth0 though there is a lot of stuff that says "loopback"
[11:45] <capitalidea> jmspeex: that's odd, about i386 working but not AMD64
[11:45] <FirstStrike> I need a new mobo and new ram for my other PC >_>
[11:45] <capitalidea> jmspeex: can you try setting up ssh on it and logging in remotely?
[11:45] <FirstStrike> I wonder if my old P4 3.06 ghz processor is still worth using
[11:45] <capitalidea> (after the crash ofcourse)
[11:45] <jmspeex> crimsun: things as in software bugs. i.e. is launchpad meant as a documentation tool for what's broken or as a way of improving Ubuntu?
[11:45] <apokryphos> jmspeex: launchpad has a bug tracker -- malone.
[11:46] <Flannel> jmspeex: both
[11:46] <ifireball> zendainc: ok, now try "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" and see what it tells you
[11:46] <apokryphos> which is of course meant for handling/fixing bugs
[11:46] <jmspeex> capitalidea: you mean ssh'ing when it crashes? no, it doesn't respond to pings. Plus the ssh server tends to crash even when the machine hasn't crashed yet.
[11:46] <elfreakz> im using bluetooth over the mobile for internet, and i use the same method over ubuntu?
[11:46] <apokryphos> I still prefer bugzilla though 8). Perhaps not Ubuntu's old setup of it though. Launchpad also isn't free software, hm.
[11:46] <jmspeex> apokryphos: yes, I've filed several bugs, but they never fixed. That's why I'm asking.
[11:46] <crimsun> jmspeex: more the latter than the former, though obviously there's an element of the former in the latter. Pure documentation is generally the wiki's realm.
[11:47] <capitalidea> jmspeex: that is quite odd. Are you using factory memory? Are they at their default timings?
[11:47] <damageDOne> crimsun: Hi again. I tried the Dapper live DVD and got the same problem. I then tried the Knoppix 5.0 live DVD and there is no sound problem with it. I'm currently in Knoppix.
[11:47] <apokryphos> jmspeex: unfortunately I can say I've mostly had the same experience. One or two I've had dealt with, but unfortunately on the majority I haven't had a response
[11:47] <crimsun> damageDOne: which version of which driver?
[11:47] <apokryphos> I'll just keep reporting, for now 8)
[11:47] <damageDOne> crimsun: Sorry?
[11:47] <jmspeex> crimsun: I guess the best example... I'm the Speex maintainer and someone has filed a bug against Speex in Dapper. The fix was posted even before Dapper was released, yet it's still not fixed.
[11:48] <crimsun> jmspeex: because we need an SRU for it.
[11:48] <crimsun> jmspeex: have you pushed the SRU process for speex?
[11:48] <crimsun> damageDOne: cat /proc/asound/version
[11:49] <avagant> so a couple of questions.
[11:49] <zendainc> ifireball: didnt say anything with the "up" at the end but when i tried it with out that it said some stuff
[11:49] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I'm using all factory stuff, it's a D820 with a Core 2 Duo. I expect the bug will hit lots and lots of people as they buy the Core 2 version of these laptops.
[11:49] <damageDOne> crimsun: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.11rc4 (Wed Mar 22 10:27:24 2006 UTC).
[11:49] <jmspeex> crimsun: What's an SRU?
[11:49] <crimsun> damageDOne: and uname -r ?
[11:49] <avagant> for one, i'm upgrading to edgy and did the "gksu update-manager -c" thing and with about 7 minutes left the thing stopped.
[11:49] <avagant> Didn't throw a message or anything.

[11:50] <markelhas> hi ppl
[11:50] <jmspeex> crimsun: here's the details: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/speex/+bug/19482
[11:50] <avagant> 2 alot of the python dependencies threw some kind of "import site" not found something something something.
[11:50] <cntb> guys funny thing, by chance pushed twice control and there appeared several characters spread on konqueror's window. status bar said access keys. where can I read about those  ?
[11:50] <ekimus> ok hardening my server a bit, rkhunter chrkootkit portsentry fail2ban, any other stuff that "just works" for a default config that I should install? I'm not planning on fancy stuff here just a few standard tools that should run everywhere as this will become a template for the other machines
[11:50] <markelhas> how can i use wine?
[11:50] <markelhas> nedd to use a windows program
[11:50] <capitalidea> jmspeex: I have a suspicion this has something to do with the GPU, if could boot with X off, try letting it sit and respond to pings while you make a sandwich or something
[11:51] <ifireball> zendainc: you mean that it told you stuff when you typed "ifconfig eth0" ?
[11:51] <avagant> 2. i don't have any sound big surprize.
[11:51] <cntb> markelhas:  it depends what program
[11:51] <capitalidea> or use links/w3m/lynx etc for a while
[11:51] <crimsun> jmspeex: the SRU URL is given in #19482
[11:51] <zendainc> ifireball: yes it came up with 7 lines of stuff i dont really understand
[11:51] <jmspeex> crimsun: I'm not an Ubuntu developer and I understand you're not supposed to be one to file a bug report, no?
[11:52] <crimsun> jmspeex: everyone is encouraged to file bug reports.
[11:52] <boink> but for a good bug report, you should try kubuntu
[11:52] <jmspeex> crimsun: But they don't get fixed unless you can fix everythign and package it in the right way?
[11:52] <ifireball> zendainc: cool, I supoose that if you type "ifconfig" now you get a line beginnig with eth0 right?
[11:53] <jmspeex> capitalidea: No longer sure about X being the problem. The box reports all kinds of timing strangeness...
[11:53] <markelhas> cntb it's a sim for ogame
[11:53] <crimsun> jmspeex: you're encouraged to push the work through
[11:53] <capitalidea> jmspeex: that could be a clock issue
[11:53] <zendainc> ifireball: yes i do have one now
[11:53] <crimsun> jmspeex: I'm happy to assist you with the SRU where I can, but I lack the resources to do every SRU I see
[11:53] <jmspeex> crimsun: I submitted a 4-line patch several months ago. I think I've done more than what should be expected.
[11:54] <cntb> I am going to try markelhas mate VM xen this means install complete windows inside linux
[11:54] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I suspect that it has to do with the kernel's handling of the clock, but not the clock itself because the i386 version works.
[11:54] <boink> jmspeex: and if try debian amd-64?
[11:54] <crimsun> jmspeex: I'm happy to discuss this with you later this afternoon (4 PM EST) if you're free
[11:54] <markelhas> i can't install wine
[11:54] <markelhas> :(
[11:54] <PiPak> Don't take my question as being spam: I have a little problem to install ubuntu from another distribution with the package initramfs-tools. It says "Unpacking initramfs-tools (from ../initramfs-tools_0.69ubuntu20_all.deb) ... : error opening volume". It looks like the pre-installation scripts are missing. My question is, how are these scripts generated?
[11:54] <avagant> Ok I paniced I still have sound.
[11:55] <boink> apt-get install won't work?
[11:55] <jmspeex> boink: debian amd64 fails with the same problem as Edgy. Dapper amd64 seems to work, or is at least much better.
[11:55] <cntb> wine is on universal repo I guess
[11:55] <cntb> markelhas:
[11:55] <boink> ok .. how about FreeBSD amd64?
[11:55] <avagant> But I have to sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in order to catch up with the rest of the 900 million packages I just had to install.
[11:55] <jmspeex> crimsun: I'm in Sydney, so I'll be sleeping.
[11:55] <porkpie> guys what would cause this problem /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl
[11:55] <Corbo> is there a gnome shortcut to flip between desktops?
[11:56] <crimsun> jmspeex: ok, what time is suitable for you, then?
[11:56] <boink> jmspeex: you could have found a good bug there, could you try a few OS's?
[11:56] <avagant> DId anyone elses edgy upgrade just suddenly stop with 7 minutes left?
[11:56] <leafw> Corbo : check the System -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts list
[11:56] <crimsun> jmspeex: (it's nearly 6 AM here)
[11:56] <avagant> Or the upgrade manager disappear?
[11:56] <jmspeex> boink: Haven't tried that. The complete list of what I tried is at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/66500
[11:56] <boink> well .. could you?
[11:57] <capitalidea> jmspeex: nothing shows up in syslog?
[11:57] <avagant> I get a feeling I should have stuck with dapper.
[11:57] <avagant> I really bad feeling.
[11:57] <jmspeex> boink: The Dapper kernel seemed to work... why try FreeBSD? Also, disabling one CPU seems to help a lot.
[11:57] <boink> jmspeex: to see if it's a linux issue or not
[11:57] <sess> anyone mind pointing me to a howto on how to enable win32 codec playback?  I installed the codecs manually, but I still can't play them
[11:57] <Corbo> thanks leaf
[11:57] <damageDOne> crimsun:2.6.17
[11:57] <jmspeex> capitalidea: Nothing in syslog or anything. The only thing suspicious I found were error messages about the time (see bug report)
[11:57] <avagant> I really hope this isn't going to take all night.
[11:58] <boink> you've only tried debian/ubuntu from your docs
[11:58] <jmspeex> boink: If Linux itself was an issue, Dapper amd64 wouldn't work.
[11:58] <crimsun> damageDOne: right, I'm afraid we've hit my time limit (it's 6 AM)

[12:02] <Corbo> lol thanks
[12:03] <ifireball> zendainc: sorry, I gtg for now, I'll be back in an hour or so

[12:03] <boink> i'll be doing a lot of work with ipsec/VPN very soon
[12:03] <capitalidea> jmspeex: try passing noapic to grub when you boot, if you feel like it you could also pass no_timer_check
[12:03] <benny> usplash can't finde an usable theme for 1280x1024... any ideas !?
[12:04] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I tried noapic, didn't change anything
[12:04] <capitalidea> Have you tried compiling a new kernel?
[12:04] <GreyGhost> so is there an EE dvd image yet?
[12:04] <Tinned_Tuna> hm
[12:05] <crayzee> Where can I get help with Compiz? I have a Radeon9200SE and glxinfo tells me I have GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap, but compiz claims I dont?

[12:06] <Trentster> Hey all, this might be an obvious question, but when runnung 3d desktop and beryl how do i disable semi tranparency for windows that are in the foreground, the problem is that when i am watching movies i can see the desktop icons under the video...any ideas.?
[12:06] <Tinned_Tuna> benny: how would I do that, please?
[12:06] <capitalidea> jmspeex: PM_TIMER, HPET, and RTC crap needs to be enabled (I am fairly certain); this is a bit of a common theme among AMD64 laptops
[12:06] <Flannel> Trentster: #ubuntu-xgl or #beryl or #xgl for support regarding that stuff, thanks.
[12:06] <benny> Tinned_Tuna: Find that standard list by google and replace the content with the /etc/apt/sources.list content
[12:07] <Tinned_Tuna> hmm, ok
[12:07] <benny> Tinned_Tuna: backup your list before plz :]

[12:07] <Tinned_Tuna> thanks
[12:07] <Akoula> how would i set a jail in ubuntu for an ircd test server?

[12:08] <Peppery> Hi!
[12:08] <avagant> it's doing this install all over again, even though i just updated to edgy. hmm.
[12:08] <capitalidea> jmspeex: as a last ditch effort, try the Gentoo install CD
[12:08] <hoelk> hi
[12:09] <hoelk> i have two windows managers installed, xface and kde, is there a clean way to remove one of them completely?
[12:09] <jmspeex> capitalidea: Well, as I said before Dapper amd64 also seemed to work.
[12:09] <Akoula> or is a jail not worth the effort?
[12:09] <avagant> ok guys cross your fingers.
[12:09] <avagant> I'm going to restart and see if anything happens.
[12:09] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I'm plannign on trying FC6 and switching to that if it works.
[12:10] <danst> hi! i am having problems with the autofs: shortly after umounting (controlled with a timeout or umount) autofs remounts the drie even though there should be no programm running which accesses the hd... does someone have a hint?
[12:10] <avagant> How many discs does FC have?
[12:10] <capitalidea> jmspeex: if Dapper worked, you could probably live with Dapper. I am not sure I like Dapper to be honest though, and were it not for some silly packages being masked on Gentoo I'd be on Gentoo right now
[12:10] <Peppery> I've been trying to install the nvidia drivers, I get this error message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30147/, I hit yes to compile them then I get this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30148/, any ideas as to why this happens?

[12:11] <speedsix> Hi, I'm trying to setup a vnc server on a machine that doesn't have a screen, doing it via ssh. I have installed vncserver on this machien and am using vncviewer but it refuses to connect, any ideas?
[12:11] <avagant> Wow that ate up ALOT of hd.
[12:11] <Peppery> speedsix: Is Gnome/KDE running?
[12:11] <speedsix> Gnome
[12:11] <Peppery> is it running?
[12:11] <speedsix> server is dapper, client is edgy
[12:12] <Peppery> 00:11 | <Peppery> is it running?
[12:12] <speedsix> I tried running the 'vncserver' command which seems to do something but it still wont connect
[12:12] <Peppery> /etc/init.d/gde start
[12:12] <Nchalada> listen to the poor man
[12:12] <Nchalada> speedsix, i mean
[12:12] <Peppery> :)
[12:12] <Akoula> lo
[12:12] <Akoula> lol*
[12:13] <speedsix> It asks me for a password and then 'xauth:  creating new authority file /home/dom/.Xauthority'
[12:13] <Akoula> oh noes !!! grub ate my i/o interface :P
[12:13] <speedsix> sorry what is gde?
[12:13] <Peppery> speedsix: Gnome desktop environment
[12:14] <capitalidea> genius Dapper eraser
[12:14] <speedsix> sorry confused. the machine I want to connect to doesn't have a monitor attached
[12:14] <Peppery> yes, to use VNC you'll need some sort of desktop manager
[12:14] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I haven't been impressed with Ubuntu lately, but I'm too lazy to switch in the short term.
[12:14] <speedsix> Oh right sorry, yes gnome is running ok
[12:14] <Peppery> Did you just start it or was it already runnign?
[12:14] <Peppery> *running evem
[12:15] <Peppery> **even
[12:15] <speedsix> I assumed installing the vncserver package would be enough to connect
[12:15] <speedsix> it was already running
=== Echtor2oo3 is now known as Echtor2oo3`wow
[12:15] <speedsix> it's just a normal dapper install but without a screen (mythtv server)
[12:15] <capitalidea> jmspeex: I know the work that would be required to get Gentoo working as gracefully as ubuntu is. I sometimes threaten myself with gobolinux on this. (there is no official port of gobolinux to AMD64 yet, last I checked)
[12:15] <capitalidea> CBA really :)
[12:16] <Peppery> speedsix: aah, then I don't know. i havn't played with vncserver
[12:16] <b0ri0> hi , i am getting this error everytime ubuntu boots http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30149/ , i googled with no luck , any idea ?
[12:16] <speedsix> I get this when trying to connect 'vncviewer: ConnectToTcpAddr: connect: Connection refused
[12:16] <speedsix> Unable to connect to VNC server'
[12:16] <Peppery> that sounds like a port/network/firewall issue of some sort tbh
[12:16] <capitalidea> speedsix: mythtv over VNC? That is going suck major penguin apples.
[12:17] <capitalidea> That's only temporary right? for the configuration of it and what not?
[12:17] <Peppery> capitalidea: could be a mythtv server only
[12:17] <Peppery> then have a different machine for the frontend
[12:17] <OkinawaSkittles5> i've forgotten how to get to my source list, can someone help me... thanks
[12:17] <capitalidea> Peppery: right, which leads me to wonder why vnc is in the picture at all
[12:18] <CheshireViking> is there an antivirus that will work with evolution mail? i know that virus's for linux are a rarity, but i receive & send emails from/to windows users and would prefer to have something in place to stop me forwarding a virus to a windows email client
[12:18] <Peppery> OkinawaSkittles5: /etc/apt
[12:18] <kikokos> how to add key`s to repository?
[12:18] <OkinawaSkittles5> thanks
[12:18] <kikokos> do u know?
[12:18] <krkrkrkr> thats impossible
[12:18] <Peppery> OkinawaSkittles5: /etc/apt/sources.list *
[12:18] <Peppery> :)
[12:19] <capitalidea> OkinawaSkittles5: What do you mean by get? The location of any file can be ascertained by using the 'locate' command like this: locate sources.list which should return /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:19] <CheshireViking> i looked at clamav, but haven't seen anything saying it would integrate with evolution
[12:19] <speedsix> capitalidea: it's only a backend server
[12:19] <capitalidea> speedsix: ah, good :-)
[12:19] <Peppery> :)
[12:19] <Peppery> Haha
[12:19] <KenSentMe> CheshireViking: maybe ask this question in the #evolution channel
[12:20] <capitalidea> 1080i doesn't really translate well as bitmaps over TCP/IP
[12:20] <CheshireViking> ok, thanks
[12:20] <Peppery> hmm
[12:20] <Peppery> deb http://nz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe
[12:21] <capitalidea> speedsix: it would probably be a good idea to paste any output from the vnc server after it's started to a paste service like rafb.net
[12:21] <capitalidea> speedsix: then perhaps someone will notice something out of place
[12:22] <Peppery> ^ :)
[12:22] <b0ri0> hi , i am getting this error everytime ubuntu boots http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30149/ , i googled with no luck , any idea ?
[12:22] <Pitbull_R> Hi all. Can anyone tell me if ubuntu is free for commercial use?
[12:22] <Peppery> b0ri0: Thats something wrong with the hard drive
[12:22] <Peppery> Pitbull_R: Yes :)
[12:22] <Pitbull_R> I mean, can I use it for a small file server on a machine that will sit in the back room of an office?
[12:22] <capitalidea> Pitbull_R: yes it is. You can read the license if you want
[12:23] <trelayne> hi all. ANyone know what package make belongs to?

[12:24] <capitalidea> damn Peppery
[12:24] <Peppery> haha! :D
[12:25] <Peppery> Don't worry. I'm only 15
[12:25] <b0ri0> Peppery, is it fixable ?
[12:25] <capitalidea> I had to really look for it too :-S
[12:25] <porkpie> guy's what would cause this cannot find -lperl
[12:25] <capitalidea> porkpie: can you give some context?
[12:26] <Peppery> Maybe not! :P
[12:26] <b0ri0> ..
[12:27] <ifireball> zendainc: still there?
[12:27] <Pitbull_R> capital: thanks anyways ;)

[12:27] <capitalidea> porkpie: ah, k, just a sec
[12:27] <Peppery> configure: error: C preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check // AAA! ITS INSANE!
[12:28] <Pitbull_R> so, being a complete newb to linux and stuff... do u think ubuntu is a good choice for a small and simple file server via samba? I mean, is it difficult to set up or is it like, out of the box or something?
[12:28] <POVaddct> Peppery: is build-essential installed?
[12:28] <Flannel> !samba | Pitbull_R
[12:28] <ubotu> Pitbull_R: samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT

[12:29] <Peppery> porkpie: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[12:29] <Pitbull_R> thanks
[12:29] <Peppery> POVaddct: hmm
[12:29] <Peppery> POVaddct: No
[12:30] <capitalidea> it shouldn't be more than 1 or 2 lines, unless something unlikely has happened and he has more than one version of libperl without a symlink to any of them
[12:30] <POVaddct> Peppery: i guess thats why the cpp check fails
[12:30] <Peppery> POVaddct: How do I install it?
[12:31] <mp3guy> in system>preferences>sound I've got three sound cards listed, I keep changing it to my audigy 4 but upon reboot it switchs back and I've no sound again. How do I make this permanent? or stop the other sound cards loading?
[12:31] <POVaddct> Peppery: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[12:31] <Nchalada> Anyone got a clue why i cant mount my NTFS partitions? get a wierd error "mount: unknown filesystem type 'ntfs-fuse'"
[12:31] <Peppery> POVaddct: ty, was typing in "build-essentials"
[12:32] <nolimitsoya> Nchalada, use -t ntfs
[12:32] <POVaddct> Peppery: ah okay
[12:32] <porkpie> capitaildea:root@Radius:~/v2.0.2/freeradius/freeradius-1.1.0# ls /usr/lib |grep libperl
[12:32] <porkpie> libperl.so.5.8
[12:32] <porkpie> libperl.so.5.8.8
[12:32] <Nchalada> so, sudo mount -t ntfs ?
[12:32] <nolimitsoya> Nchalada, yes
[12:32] <capitalidea> porkpie: ok, the reason why is there is no link to your libperl that the make file can find
[12:32] <Nchalada> ty
[12:33] <SiC> is there anyway of playing wma and wmv files in ubuntu?
[12:33] <Peppery> SiC: See VLC media player

[12:33] <Peppery> SiC: www.videolan.org
[12:33] <SiC> cheers
[12:33] <Peppery> :)
[12:33] <porkpie> capitalidea:how do I fix it
[12:33] <SiC> didnt know you could get VLC for linux :o
[12:33] <nolimitsoya> SiC, apt-get install mplayer vlc
[12:33] <capitalidea> porkpie: Try 'ln -s /usr/lib/libperl.so.5.8.8 libperl.so'
[12:34] <capitalidea> porkpie: cd to /usr/lib first
[12:34] <Peppery> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30150/

[12:38] <scamboy> nc: student??
[12:38] <capitalidea> jmspeex: it should be, I can't see why not. You know how to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy right? just copy the Dapper kernel to a safe place and then let it rip
[12:38] <chris2kn5> scamboy: appfinder dont find grub?
[12:38] <miranda82> i got 2 xorg.conf version working perfectly, one for dual view, and a normal one, is it possible throught grub to choose wich one to boot with?

[12:39] <Nchalada> bbiat, gota go find it lool
[12:39] <nolimitsoya> sundari, you need to use sudo
[12:40] <sundari> ok... how do I do that?
[12:40] <Peppery> !sudo | sundari
[12:40] <ubotu> sundari: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.

[12:40] <Peppery> zendainc: Are you using a DHCP server?
[12:41] <scamboy> sundari: use ur root account, go to the partition, then right click, select propertise, permission...change it there for ur account..
[12:41] <nolimitsoya> sundari, to get ownership of all files and folders on that drive, use: sudo chown -r <yourusername>:<yourusername> /<pathtomountpoint>
[12:41] <Nchalada> dang it, it picked the wrong sound card :S
[12:41] <miranda82> i got 2 xorg.conf version working perfectly, one for dual view, and a normal one, is it possible throught grub to choose wich one to boot with?
[12:41] <zendainc> peppery: im not sure im new to using linux
[12:42] <jmspeex> capitalidea: I've already got Edgy, so it would be nice if I could just install Dapper's kernel.
[12:42] <ekimus> is there any strange place where hwclock gets executed at boot time I created K00hwclock symlinks in all runlevels (rc1-6) but there is still a hwclock process upon reboot
[12:42] <Peppery> zendainc: are you using a router of some sort?
[12:42] <Xtreme> when i try to start beryl manager my windows mess up and i cant click the taskbar icon what should i do ??
[12:42] <nolimitsoya> miranda82, would be easier making a swript that switched them, and then restarting x manualy
[12:42] <capitalidea> jmspeex: then you could probably grab it right off the repos and toss it in /boot, change grub.conf et voila
[12:42] <zendainc> peppery: im tryin to connect to the internet over my windows lan, it is a router with several computers connected to it which is in turn connected to my modem

[12:43] <chris2kn5> scamboy: so im not sure... i have windows installed on C:\ drive... which is /dev/hda1 for xbuntu... and i have unallocated space of 268...something... how do i set up and install xbuntu on seperate partition hard drive?  it kept pointing back to /dev/hd1?
[12:43] <hellooooo> which linux/gnu os do you think is best for programming ?
[12:43] <ifireball> miranda82: nope, afaik, but you can config the dual-view version to allow you to go down to single-screen with ctrl+shift+"+"
[12:43] <ROBOd> hello guys
[12:43] <ROBOd> does any of you use apache2 in ubuntu?
[12:43] <ifireball> ROBOd: I do
[12:43] <ekimus> hellooooo:  programming in which language?
[12:43] <ROBOd> does anyone know what could cause apache 2.0.55 to stop sending files at about 98%?
[12:43] <ROBOd> on slow connections
[12:43] <miranda82> ifireball, isn't something to choose the file before loading gdm?
[12:43] <ROBOd> like ... 10 kb/s
[12:43] <jmspeex> capitalidea: where do I grab it?
[12:43] <hellooooo> c programming language
[12:43] <ROBOd> it always stops at about 98%
[12:44] <markus_> hellooooo: I think it doesn't matter
[12:44] <ROBOd> even if the file is 600 kb, or the file is 2 mb
[12:44] <jamj> hi all, someone knows how to activate hardware acceleration with intel 855GME
[12:44] <Xtreme> when i try to start beryl manager my windows mess up and i cant click the taskbar icon what should i do ?? it says xgl absent nvidia present
[12:44] <ROBOd> anyone has any suggestions? please
[12:44] <ROBOd> i'm very sure it's not a network problem
[12:44] <nolimitsoya> ROBOd, man apache?
[12:44] <ifireball> miranda82: nope, but I got a new idea, you can make GDM run both servers in different VTs e.g one in VT7 and one in VT8
[12:44] <ROBOd> nolimitsoya: doh
[12:45] <scamboy> cris2kn5: usually /dev/ha1 has windows on it with NTFS.....how big is ur hardisk space? how much for windows n how much for u keep for xubuntu??
[12:45] <hellooooo> c programming language
[12:45] <ekimus> hellooooo:  i'd say gentoo is quite convenient for that (programming only it's a pain to maintain) because of it's layout you will have all the sources and dev libraries available. on the other hand it isn't that hard to apt-get install dev-$PACKAGE in ubuntu to achieve the same
[12:45] <miranda82> ifireball, um...
[12:45] <jamj> try reinstall  berly
[12:45] <theplatypus> If I remove my soundcard and use onboard sound what is needed to reconfigure alsa ?
[12:45] <ROBOd> nolimitsoya: did you ever see man apache2?
[12:45] <Nchalada> nolimitsoya, how do you tell alsamixer to use my proper sound card?
[12:45] <miranda82> ifireball, i know start X -config file.conf     loads X with that config file... don't u use i could use something with that?
[12:45] <Xtreme> when i try to start beryl manager my windows mess up and i cant click the taskbar icon what should i do ?? it says xgl absent nvidia present
[12:46] <capitalidea> jmspeex: good question, I don't see it in the repository
[12:46] <chris2kn5> scamboy:  im having windows in 30GB... and i want to set up xbuntu for 30GB too...
[12:47] <capitalidea> jmspeex: I don't see an obvious candidate in Contents-amd64.gz either
[12:47] <nolimitsoya> Nchalada, file->options
[12:47] <Nchalada> there is no menu :S
[12:47] <scamboy> chris2kn5: so ur hardisk is 60gb??? and when it shows 2xxx is it gb??
[12:47] <nolimitsoya> Nchalada, dorry, in xfce4-mixer :)
[12:48] <nolimitsoya> *s
[12:48] <chris2kn5> no... hmm, the hard drive is around 250gb
[12:48] <capitalidea> jmspeex: oic, kernel-package
[12:48] <chris2kn5> scamboy: read up
[12:48] <ifireball> miranda82: gdm doesn't start x with startx it runns the X server directly, but you can actually tell it in its onfig file how to run the X server including which parameters to give it, also note that you can combine the 2 configs in the same file using 2 different ServerLayout sections
[12:48] <scamboy> chris2kn5:wow....is it externel???
[12:49] <chris2kn5> scamboy: hmm, it's internal hard drive
[12:49] <TimothyP> Hi, when you install ubuntu (server edition) a text based configuration utility for your network card appears, how can I use this after isntallation ? that configuration tool ?
[12:49] <miranda82> ifireball, yeash, that might be the idea i' m looking forward
[12:49] <miranda82> ifireball, gdm.conf?
[12:49] <ifireball> miranda82: yeah, that the place to start
[12:49] <ulaas> latest apt-get upgrade offers me to remove xorg? any ideas?
[12:49] <miranda82> ifireball, ok, cool, i'll give it a try, thx
[12:50] <scamboy> chris2kn5: so u can use norton partition to format the unused space...say 30gb.....then u can instal linux..
[12:50] <Mogz> http://wiki.ubuntustudio.org/index.php?title=Dapper:Vanilla_Kernel_With_Realtime_Preemption <-- following this guide, how would I want to do to actually HAVE a boot splash?
[12:50] <special1> hi
[12:51] <special1> can you type mi nick please ?
[12:51] <chris2kn5> scamboy: i would have to get norton partition first... and hmm, i did format the empty space (i had nothing on that area anyway), thus making it unallocated... im trying to install it on hard drive (there was 'install' icon on xbuntu desktop... how would i be able to use that?
[12:52] <special1> please, somebody can type my nick
[12:52] <special1> special1
[12:52] <markus_> special1
[12:52] <scamboy> chris2kn5: wait, hav use instal xubuntu???

[12:52] <chris2kn5> scamboy:  yup... hmm, yes, 'Install'
[12:52] <special1> thank you
[12:52] <nolimitsoya> Peppery, apt-get install?

[12:54] <chuckyp> cntb, whatever konquer uses
[12:54] <chris2kn5> scamboy: nope... this is my first time playing around with xubutu (running from live cd right now)... and the first thing im trying to do is to install it on hard drive
[12:54] <scamboy> !alsa|nchalada
[12:54] <ubotu> nchalada: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

[12:54] <dcordes> cd #ubuntu-de
[12:54] <cntb> l chuckyp is it multilink by default
[12:55] <capitalidea> jmspeex: found it
[12:55] <chuckyp> cntb, dunno don't use kde here.  Perhaps #kubuntu would know
[12:55] <cntb> there is no #kubuntu to my lnowledge chuckyp
[12:55] <chuckyp> cntb, /j #kubuntu
[12:55] <Nchalada> where do i select ALSA??!
[12:55] <Nchalada> lol
[12:56] <chuckyp> Nchalada, alsamixer
[12:56] <capitalidea> jmspeex: uh ok false alarm, but the main thing is I did find how to get to it once I know what it is
[12:56] <chuckyp> capitalidea, url for what?
[12:56] <Juhaz> Peppery, (g)libc is a library, not application
[12:56] <Nchalada> yes, got that, but i cant select any different sound card in Alsamixer
[12:56] <cntb> alive and kicking sorry chuckyp
[12:56] <chuckyp> !info glibc
[12:56] <Nchalada> tried

[12:57] <chuckyp> there it is
[12:57] <markus_> Peppery: glibc is also called "libc". you might want to try that
[12:57] <scamboy> chris2kn5: so u can try u the xubuntu instal cd......when u enter the partion table....manually edit it.....the one with ntfs...dun ever disturb it.....configure the new 30gb drive as / the root system.....the u can create a swap space which is double of ur ram amount....
[12:57] <capitalidea> chuckyp: the Dapper AMD64 kernel
[12:57] <netpython> is xorg statically linked in Ubuntu?
[12:57] <Peppery> markus_: thanks, but i fixed my problem. needed build-essentials
[12:57] <chuckyp> chris2kn5, xubuntu support can also be found in #xubuntu
[12:58] <chuckyp> capitalidea, packages.ubuntu.com

[01:00] <babo> this is a newline on linux right ? ... "/r" ...

[01:00] <babo> oops, I meant to say "/n"
[01:00] <markus_> babo: no, newline is \n
[01:00] <Nchalada> bbiaty
[01:00] <capitalidea> jmspeex: actually wait a sec
[01:00] <babo> markus: arraghh ... yes, that's what I really meant to say ...
[01:01] <chuckyp> Nchalada, you can add it  right click and add volume control
[01:01] <markus_> babo: ;)
[01:01] <capitalidea> jmspeex: go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/base/ and look for linux-amd64
[01:01] <cartucho> morning
[01:01] <dizzie> G'day all
[01:02] <chuckyp> morning
[01:02] <netpython> hello
[01:02] <dizzie> Is it morning? ;)
[01:02] <jmspeex> capitalidea: thanks
[01:02] <Juhaz> it's always morning somewhere!
[01:02] <POVaddct> Sat Nov  4 13:03:11 CET 2006
[01:02] <dizzie> True that, but as POVaddct, its 1pm here :)
[01:02] <POVaddct> hehe
[01:02] <capitalidea> jmspeex: sure thing
[01:02] <leafw> Juhaz : like right here. Beatiful rainy morning.
[01:03] <capitalidea> jmspeex: actually, look for linux-image
[01:03] <chuckyp> leafw, snow on the ground here
[01:03] <loca|host> i want to setup a c station that will be dedicated to internet navigation only via firefox, no other applications, what do you suggest me ?
[01:03] <netpython> capitalidea, or make one yourself?
[01:03] <leafw> what is up with this linux-image upgrade today? ATI driver screwed up?
[01:03] <chuckyp> loca|host, there is info on setting up ubuntu in a kiosk sort of mode is that what you are looking for?
[01:03] <capitalidea> netpython: he's trying to avoid cross compiling
[01:03] <Juhaz> leafw, I'd take beautiful rainy morning over horribly awfully cold and freezing beautiful sunny day any time, but oh well. got to do with what we have
[01:03] <cntb> channel for xen VM?
[01:04] <netpython> capitalidea, i see
[01:04] <leafw> chuckyp: where is "here"? It snowed here in Dresden two days ago, but didn't catch
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[01:04] <capitalidea> netpython: actually he's trying to avoid compiling at all, stability problems, it probably would lock before the make install finished
[01:04] <marsm> when using xchat, to hide the join/part messages all you have to do is right click on the #ubuntu tab down below and select the option
[01:04] <leafw> Juhaz : cold never deterred me, as long as it's not raining ice.
[01:04] <chuckyp> leafw, North Eastern Ohio, United States
[01:05] <leafw> chatting deep into the night hum
[01:05] <POVaddct> leafw: ha! dresden. i live there too.
[01:05] <cntb> channel for xen VM?
[01:05] <capitalidea> So is AMD64 K8 an AMD-specific optimized kernel for AMD64 AMD processors?
[01:05] <cntb> how to install xen
[01:05] <leafw> POVaddct : I know, you refused a dual power mac
[01:05] <leafw> xD
[01:05] <POVaddct> leafw: :)
[01:05] <leafw> cntb : that question is for google or ubuntu forums search field
[01:05] <Xtreme> when i try to start beryl manager my windows mess up and i cant click the taskbar icon what should i do ?? it says xgl absent nvidia present
[01:06] <POVaddct> leafw: too many nicks here. i didnt remember you..
[01:06] <marsm> with that out of the way: whenever i start nautilus in fluxbox it changes my fluxbox menu to the gnome menu and puts desktop icons on it, too ... is this some kind of feature?
[01:06] <leafw> POVaddct : indeed
[01:06] <scamboy> chuck: its night here..:-P
[01:06] <Juhaz> granted, it's just -5C anymore, but that's cold enough for me
[01:06] <ekimus> capitalidea:  that was the highest number of occurences of AMD i ever saw in 1 sentence :)
[01:06] <Peppery> Wow
[01:06] <Peppery> I hate the SE
[01:06] <Peppery> So hot down here :P
[01:06] <capitalidea> ekimus: I can try harder :-D
[01:07] <Peppery> err
[01:07] <Peppery> SH it would be
[01:07] <da1> any idea how to "view" a .exe file in ubuntu?
[01:07] <Xtreme> when i try to start beryl manager my windows mess up and i cant click the taskbar icon what should i do ?? it says xgl absent nvidia present
[01:07] <leafw> da1 : try $ vim *.exe
[01:07] <capitalidea> What do you mean by view da1 ?
[01:07] <capitalidea> leafw: :-P
[01:07] <leafw> da1: poerhaps with a '-b' binary switch
[01:07] <ekimus> capitalidea:  but to answer your question - yes the package names indicate for which platform it is optimized
[01:07] <Peppery> Fetched 44.0MB in 2m35s (282kB/s)
[01:07] <chuckyp> loca|host, You could create a guest user auto launch firefox. and remove all the menu stuff for that user with alcarte  and lock down gnome.
[01:07] <Peppery> :)
[01:08] <da1> leafw :cool, i'll give it a try, thanx!
[01:08] <loca|host> chuckyp, howto lockdown gnome ?
[01:08] <leafw> da1: there are other hex and bin editors out there, just google a little
[01:08] <chuckyp> loca|host, also you may want to checkout kiosktool for kde as another option gnome has a kiosk tool as well.
[01:09] <capitalidea> ekimus: very interesting, so is there any benefit then over the generic? It's all AMD64, with the exception of a few operations EM64T and AMD64 are practically the same... I'm a bit confused
[01:09] <chuckyp> loca|host, what version of ubuntu are you using?
[01:09] <loca|host> chuckyp, dapper drake
[01:09] <da1> capalidea: i downloaded a game of sort, wanted to check it out! i'll let u know if it doesn't work out for me!
[01:09] <chuckyp> Applications, System Tools, Configuration Editor, desktop, gnome, lockdown
[01:09] <chuckyp> loca|host, ^^^^^^^^^
[01:09] <leafw> I have a question for apt-get wizards: can ubuntu be turned into a "gentoo"-style machine, i.e. reinstall all packages by compiling them from source packages?
[01:10] <capitalidea> da1: you need wine or cedega
[01:10] <beowulf-afk> hola
[01:10] <capitalidea> how do we use ubotu again?
[01:10] <KSTC> hi
[01:10] <KSTC> what means: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable

[01:10] <capitalidea> ok, there we go :)
[01:10] <loca|host> chuckyp, Configuration Editor ?? i dont get it
[01:10] <chuckyp> loca|host, search in synaptic for sabayon   that is the gnome tool for easy user configs
[01:10] <togga> is there any way I can get a dependancy-tree of packages not reachable from a set of packages (ubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop) ?

[01:11] <beowulf-afk> dl'd , burned and then tried to run the live cd... not working... does the pc need to be rebooted for it to work?
[01:11] <leafw> perhaps give it a "list it all but don't do anything" switch to get it
[01:11] <capitalidea> beowulf-afk: most certainly
[01:11] <togga> leafw: I want to see all packages I have installed outside a couple of meta-package. And I want them as a tree-view
[01:12] <beowulf-afk> thank you :)
[01:12] <capitalidea> ;-)
[01:12] <leafw> togga : dpkg-query and related are your friends.
[01:12] <togga> leafw: thanks
[01:12] <zsh> hi. i keep getting this message when i try to run any opengl apps Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
[01:12] <higen> is there any filesystem that can be easily read on linux and os x?  xfs? jfs? anything?`
[01:12] <unikuse1> I dont think you have a way to see them in tree view
[01:13] <leafw> higen: ext3 is readable from OSX
[01:13] <chuckyp> zsh, what does glxinfo | grep render     return?
[01:13] <zsh> i"ve tried everything on forums but it still nothing
[01:13] <leafw> higen : also reiserfs and fat32
[01:14] <zsh> chuckyp, same thing, several instances of  Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"
[01:14] <chuckyp> zsh, what type of video card do you have also.
[01:14] <zsh> its supposed to be an nvidia mx440, but it identifies itself as a sis 315pro
[01:15] <zsh> chuckyp
[01:15] <zsh> i'm hoping i wont have to buy another card since this ones probably fake
[01:15] <chuckyp> zsh, hrm.. well thats definately an issue.  You could try adding "glx"  under the modules section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and then restart X  ctrl+alt+backspace
[01:16] <chuckyp> zsh, Yeah thats definately wierd that an nvidia card would report an sis chipset.
[01:16] <zsh> yeah, i tried that nothing
[01:16] <Peppery> Hmm
[01:16] <chuckyp> zsh, Which driver are you using?
[01:16] <Peppery> anyone know how to configure x?
[01:16] <chuckyp> Peppery, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf or sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:16] <zsh> i googled around, it turns out there is a nvidia bios editor around
[01:16] <togga> leafw: found the solution..   python-apt ...
[01:16] <zsh> the sis one
[01:17] <Peppery> cheers chuckyp
[01:17] <chuckyp> zsh, hmmm... well maybe they used the sis chipset back in the day or something.
[01:17] <capitalidea> chuckyp: definitely not
[01:17] <user-land> how can i start the partitioner ?
[01:17] <zsh> chuckyp, hmmmmm.
[01:17] <capitalidea> zsh: you are sure you don't have multiple GPUs in your PC? this couldn't be from the mainboard?
[01:18] <zsh> chuckyp, but it should still identify itself as an nvidia card dont you think
[01:18] <ekimus> a backup of dpkg --get-selection and /etc should be enough to recreate the system if I decide do start from scratch right?
[01:18] <capitalidea> zsh: and you got this info from lspci?
[01:18] <zsh> capitalidea, i only have one card
[01:18] <zsh> capitalidea, yes
[01:18] <higen> leafw: so if i format my usbdrive to ext3, it can be read from os x after plugged in?
[01:18] <capitalidea> zsh: then it is a fake :-(
[01:18] <capitalidea> zsh, time to murderlate
[01:19] <user-land> is there a partitioner installed on edgy ?
[01:19] <zsh> capitalidea, hmmm :(
[01:19] <ekimus> user-land:  cfdisk
[01:19] <chuckyp> user-land, fdisk
[01:19] <capitalidea> maybe you can file the PCB into a sharp blade to incur your revenge on the blackhearted seller who duped you
[01:20] <chuckyp> zsh, isn't an old card?
[01:21] <user-land> thanks ekimus and chuckyp, so no gui tool installed for that by default ? or is it just too buggy to be recommended ?
[01:21] <constrictor> Has anyone ever tried installing Amarok on Gnom
[01:21] <constrictor> gnome*
[01:21] <fjellrev1> yeah,works perfectly
[01:21] <chuckyp> user-land, you can install gparted from synaptic or just use the livecd I believe that has gparted on it.  or sudo apt-get install gparted
[01:21] <chuckyp> constrictor, yeah I use it.
[01:21] <user-land> thanks chuckyp.
[01:22] <chuckyp> user-land, np
[01:22] <ekimus> user-land:  parted is something i had rumors about... don't know if it works reliably
[01:22] <constrictor> chuckyp, i don't want to have to cross into the KDE realm though
[01:22] <chuckyp> constrictor, no works fine.
[01:22] <chuckyp> constrictor, just sudo apt-get install amarok
[01:22] <constrictor> ok i'll do it now thanks
[01:22] <chuckyp> constrictor, I use it as my default music player.
[01:22] <user-land> there are problems with it still, ekimus, you are right.
[01:23] <chuckyp> !info gparted
[01:23] <ubotu> gparted: GNOME partition editor. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu11 (edgy), package size 314 kB, installed size 1588 kB
[01:23] <user-land> what is the worst you heard, ekimus ?
[01:23] <chuckyp> user-land, I've never had a problem with it.  Worst case scenario could be you lose your data.
[01:23] <chuckyp> user-land, what do you need to do specifically?
[01:24] <user-land> right, but did you hear about that happening ?
[01:24] <massemonster> f
[01:24] <ekimus> user-land:  don't know it's some gui tool and since I have a mac as a desktop I stick with cfdisk (fdisk is said to be more reliable but i find it's usage to be error prone)
[01:24] <chuckyp> user-land, I've never lost data or heard about it hapening  but you run that risk any time you are resizing partitions etc...
[01:24] <user-land> chuckyp, at the moment just format an additional sata disk i just connected.
[01:24] <chuckyp> user-land, then I wouldn't worrry about it.  If the drive has no data on it that you are worried about format away.
[01:25] <ezp> buenos dias
[01:25] <user-land> right, chuckyp. the worst i heard and saw were problems where gparted just did not work or work as it should.
[01:25] <chuckyp> user-land, You run the risk of data loss anytime you resizing partitions etc... Or if you are just blindly clicking on stuff that you don't know what it does.  In your case I think you will be safe using gparted.
[01:25] <chuckyp> user-land, exactly.
[01:25] <chuckyp> Was there a netsplit or something I missed?
[01:26] <cantik> hiiiiiiiiiiii
[01:26] <zsh> chuckyp, yeah its pretty old, worked fine on *doz though

[01:26] <georgeb> Hi, I need some info regarding the sound system on ubuntu; I don't get it what is "the way" to make it work "perfect"; how can I make alsa to be full-duplex (to be able to use two sound enabled apps at the same time) or alsa is more like a low level layer for sound and I have to use arts for that ?
[01:26] <chuckyp> zsh, with nvidia drivers?  or windows default drivers?
[01:26] <user-land> yesterday i tried to install edgy on an external usb harddisk and gparted saw it but did not want to reformat an existing ext3 partition there ...
[01:26] <loca|host> what is kickstart ?
[01:27] <chuckyp> georgeb, my sound works that way by default.  Maybe poke around in alsamixer  or search the forums.
[01:27] <Crazed> where can I get my MAC address on ETH0 ?
[01:27] <chuckyp> Crazed, ifconfig eth0
[01:28] <georgeb> Crazed: the MAC address is the HWaddr in ifconfig
[01:28] <chuckyp> Crazed, ifconfig eth0 | grep HWaddr if thats all you want
[01:28] <Crazed> yea I understand that :)
[01:28] <Crazed> not that stupid ;)
[01:28] <Crazed> but thx
[01:29] <constrictor> i have done it before so it's not a problem for me but i think there should be an easier way to have evolution download hotmail without downloading and configuring a perl script
[01:29] <chuckyp> loca|host, kickstart is a way to make automated installations
[01:29] <loca|host> chuckyp, is it the best ?
[01:29] <chuckyp> Crazed, don't know what level you are on sry.
[01:30] <chuckyp> loca|host, dunno never used it.
[01:30] <chuckyp> loca|host, perhaps ask in the forums. forums.ubuntu.org
[01:30] <loca|host> chuckyp,  thx
[01:30] <zsh> chuckyp, come to think of it, the drivers i downloaded from the nvidia site failed, but drivers that came with the card worked
[01:30] <chuckyp> loca|host, err www.ubuntuforums.org
[01:30] <Crazed> np chuckyp  :)
[01:30] <chuckyp> zsh, When did you get hte card?
[01:31] <zsh> chuckyp, about a year ago
[01:31] <jmspeex> capitalidea: Got it, I'll try that a bit later...
[01:31] <chuckyp> zsh, Yeah I'd be pulling the card out to see what the chipset says.  But that definately is goofy.
[01:31] <timnewtoubuntu> hiho, i am new tu ubuntu and to linux :) and i got some questions ... how to see the windows partition ?
[01:31] <chuckyp> zsh, who knows could have got misslabeled from whomever you bought it from.
[01:31] <chuckyp> !ntfs > timnewtoubuntu
[01:31] <loca|host> i dont get the "Applications > System Tools > Configuration Editor" on my dapper
[01:31] <jmspeex> timnewtoubuntu: FAT32 or NTFS?
[01:32] <LuisMendes> how can I bring up 'fglrx-control'?
[01:32] <timnewtoubuntu> ntfs
[01:32] <timnewtoubuntu> there was a hint during the installation for: system->admin->some disc app ... but i dont find anything :D
[01:32] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, did you try typing fglrx-control in terminal  or hit alt+f2 and type it in there
[01:32] <jmspeex> LuisMendes: Don't use the ATI closed-source drivers ;-)
[01:32] <zsh> chuckyp, nope, its labeled mx440 by the manufacturer(whoever it is coz its definitely not nvidia), its chinese made
[01:32] <chuckyp> !ntfs | timnewtoubuntu
[01:32] <ubotu> timnewtoubuntu: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions  -  See also !fuse
[01:33] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, yes I've tried, it says 'command not found'
[01:33] <chuckyp> zsh, hrm...
[01:33] <timnewtoubuntu> thx!
[01:33] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, is it installed?
[01:33] <LuisMendes> jmspeex, there are not the ATI's closed drivers
[01:33] <jmspeex> timnewtoubuntu: You can't write to NTFS (unless you're willing to try experimental stuff), but you can read it.
[01:33] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, sure it is
[01:33] <zsh> chuckyp, oh, well i'll have to buy another card soon :(
[01:33] <jmspeex> LuisMendes: sorry, I thought fglrx was only for those.
[01:33] <Trentster> Hi all, can someone please help me revert back to the kernel and nvidia-glx version that ships with edgy, as I have tried to get built-in AIGLX working by installing the nvidia beta drivers , now frequency scaling no longer works and these nvidia drivers for some reason cannot display 19" wide lcd resolutions of 1440 x 900 ...help?
[01:33] <LuisMendes> jmspeex, oops sorry, I meant 'these' in the other message
[01:33] <zsh> chuckyp, capitalidea, thanks
[01:34] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, try locate fglrx-control or which fglrx-control in terminal  if no responses try sudo apt-get install fglrx-control
[01:34] <chuckyp> Trentster, how idd you install the nvidia beta drivers from the nvidia package?  or some other directions?
[01:34] <[BTF] Chm0d> Trenster where are you trying to change resolution?
[01:34] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, sudo apt-get install fglrx-control says "fglrx-control is already the newest version"

[01:34] <nickblack> hello, I've just rebooted my xubuntu box for the first time in about 6 weeks.  It seems to boot up ok - GDM loads with the xubuntu splash.  but after a type my password and user, I am returned back to teh gdm screen.  I've tried to load into xfce and fluxbox - both unsuccessfully.  Any clues?
[01:35] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, okay which fglrx-control
[01:35] <rambo3> how do i change permission on  dir  that is on vfat usb drive
[01:35] <chuckyp> nickblack, /j #xubuntu
[01:35] <jrib> rambo3: mount it with the proper umask
[01:35] <nickblack> chuckyp: k
[01:35] <Trentster> chuckyp, i added the "deb http://amaranth.selfip.com edgy lrm" to my sources list then did an update, then did " apt-get install nvidia-glx
[01:35] <chemaja> does anyone remember that image posted inline to http://planet.ubuntu.org a while back -- the one with tips on being productive? ie. "do one thing at a time" -- does anyone have the URL to this image?
[01:36] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, 8.28.8+2.6.17.6-1  that's the version :p
[01:36] <chuckyp> Trentster, arghhh well you still need that repo added then you would have to sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-glx     then remove the repo from sources.list and sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[01:36] <[BTF] Chm0d> Trentster: if you are changing the resolution via the system preferences that is the wrong place
[01:36] <chemaja> umm i mean http://planet.ubuntulinux.org/
[01:36] <[BTF] Chm0d> i fyou have the nvidia beta drivers installed
[01:37] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, type "which fglrx-control"    in a terminal  without the qoutes
[01:37] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, nothing gets printed with that
[01:37] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, alrigth try locate fglrx-control
[01:38] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, not I got lots of locations
[01:38] <Trentster> chuckyp, thanks...
[01:38] <chuckyp> Trentster, np
[01:38] <Trentster> [BTF] Chm0d, no im changing it in xorg.conf
[01:38] <[BTF] Chm0d> k sorry
[01:38] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, hrm...
[01:39] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, maybe it is an applet did you try right clicking on a panel and seeing if its in there.
[01:40] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, like right click on a blank spot on a panel and click add to panel  and see if its listed there.
[01:40] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, nope, it's not there...
[01:42] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, try typing fglrx    then hit tab see if it autocompletes  the name may be slightly different.  if nothing hit tab twice
[01:42] <LuisMendes> chuckyp, with one tab nothing happens.. two, it gives me this: fglrxinfo     fglrx_xgamma
[01:42] <chuckyp> LuisMendes, try fire  then hit tab twice

[01:47] <chadswill> hm..how do i set permission for me as user? ..i installed a game as root(had to)
[01:48] <shadowfalx> reiki had same problem, give me a minuite and I'll find the comand line to fix (Atleast for me)
[01:48] <chadswill> chmod "user" ?
[01:48] <reiki> shadowfalx, thanks
[01:48] <reiki> chadswill, you need to make it owned by user or just runnable?
[01:48] <chatelaine24> ping me!!!!
[01:48] <rhican> chadswill, you probably want to add your user to the games group
[01:48] <abli> Isn't booting supposed to be faster with edgy than with dapper? is significantly slower for me. Any ideas how to debug this?
[01:49] <shadowfalx> try this <sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg> (without the <> ofcourse)
[01:49] <shadowfalx> my last was for reiki
[01:50] <chadswill> hmm..dont see a "games" group
[01:50] <reiki> shadowfalx, thank you. I wonder why they'd puch an update that breaks something so important. :)
[01:51] <reiki> ok now EDGY wants to get the same type of update. I think we will be saying "no" until I get Dapper fixed.... back in a bit. Thanks shadowfalx

[01:58] <reiki> shadowfalx, I didn't run that reconfigure command... I just restarted and it worked. Not sure why a restart didn't work before
[01:58] <nocturn> strange...
[01:59] <reiki> shadowfalx, I'm back in Dapper (was in Edgy before) so maybe now I'll reboot to Edgy and let it update and see what happens

[01:59] <nocturn> the VIA is eth0 there
[01:59] <shadowfalx> lol, just be glad its working now, the universe is full of small mysteries I guess

[02:11] <jrib> mm2000: which iso are you download?  What's the name?
[02:11] <bieb> hmm I have never seen that mm2000, I downloaded from the site 2 weeks ago and had no problem buring the cd
[02:11] <Skyrail> one other thing will 6.10 ever be free? I will buy it...when I find my card :|
[02:12] <compengi> can gnomebaker open multi-session disks?

[02:15] <bieb> Skyrail, my bad.. I hadn't looked since 6.10 was released
[02:16] <Skyrail> ah well, I'll ave to wait until I find my card, thats more likely to happen then my dad getting a ebtter internet connection

[03:09] <Farm_Fresh> Alright.... when I first installed ubuntu 6.06 in august... I needed to do the ndiswrapper work around to use the netgear wireless adapter.. And just this week after not liking Edgy, I did a clean install of Dapper after formatting the entire drive and today the wireless adapter worked right after installation.. ie out of box sort of..  How is this possible?
[03:10] <Jeruvy> admin123: ok, step one.  Ask the question consisely.  step two.  Don't repeat yourself in the same sentence.  HTH :)
[03:10] <Farm_Fresh> I didn't need to do anything..
[03:11] <Daverocks> Farm_Fresh: don't ask me why linux works "too well" ;)
[03:11] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: If you used 6.06.1 the kernel is more recent.
[03:11] <Daverocks> but that is weird
[03:12] <Daverocks> but i wouldn't think they'd include proprietary windows drivers in the ubuntu kernel?
[03:12] <weardlan> Hi folks, I tried 6.10rc1 and it failed to mount/find the CDrom in orderd to actually boot on my SonyVaio. Can anyone confirm this is resolved in the final release before I download it?
[03:12] <Farm_Fresh> Vorbote:  I'm not sure if it was 6.06.1 or not.. I know I burned the image mid september.
[03:13] <Vorbote> Daverocks: There are many *native* wireless drivers in the kernel. But people are told "use ndiswrappers". How in hell do you think Linux will have real support if people take the easy (and illegal, btw) way out?
[03:13] <Farm_Fresh> Daverocks:  It seems more of a paradigm.
[03:13] <Vorbote> Farm_Fresh: if you downloaded a new image then, it probably was 6.06.1
[03:14] <Daverocks> Vorbote: fair enough
[03:14] <keithhhhh> anyone use XCAL??
[03:14] <Vorbote> Those open source drivers, being reversersed engineered, need lots of real-world testing.

[03:23] <gnomefreak> Tigge: what drivers and what version of ubuntu?
[03:23] <_arnon> i figured there was no "official" way. but lets say i have some prior linux knowledge. is there something i can do to at least move the image to the HD, in order to free up the cd drive?
[03:23] <gnomefreak> Tompu: not sure
[03:23] <_arnon> tompu - yeah it does
[03:24] <dlsdas> how can I save the current config of iwconfig?

[03:28] <IndyBC> gnomefreak: what is "feisty"?

[03:28] <_arnon> ekimus: so the best way to go with this is to just get a new install-cd image, and run it from within vmware?
[03:28] <lostboyz> i can see my webcam when i plug it in but when i send it it is not recieved any answers? i have been trying to fix this for over a month
[03:28] <IndyBC> the next ubuntu release?
[03:28] <kikokos> ye
[03:28] <IndyBC> !feisty
[03:28] <ubotu> The next version of Ubuntu will be codename Feisty Fawn it should be released in April 2007 and so have the release name 7.04. Until released it is beta. Today it is not even alpha. ;-)
[03:28] <kikokos> and core dumped
[03:28] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: the next ubuntu version due out in late april
[03:28] <philipsmith> Tompu: Thanks for your reply. It is slow, then slightly faster from subsequent page loads to the same site.
[03:28] <keithhhhh> Daverocks:  I have firefox in there... could I remove it?
[03:29] <kikokos> gnome freak about this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30170/
[03:29] <weardlan> 6.10rc1 could not mount the cdrom at boot and failed (completely failed after unpacking the miniKernel). is 6.10 "stable" going to do the same?
[03:29] <_arnon> ekimus: can i install vmware on a live-cd setup, at all?

[03:29] <Tompu> philipsmith: i found that i needed to blacklist the ipv6 module to stop attempted ipv6 lookups, which instantly fixed my problem
[03:29] <gnomefreak> Amaranth: you around?
[03:29] <keithhhhh> Daverocks: ya I understand hehe
[03:29] <netpython> hello
[03:30] <kikokos> maybe somebody else want to see this example http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30170/ :)
[03:30] <kikokos> hello
[03:30] <Daverocks> keithhhhh: if you have another version of firefox somewhere else that you can use, then i guess you could delete the one in /opt but i don't recommend it because it's probably integrated with your desktop environment etc and is probably there for a reason
[03:30] <philipsmith> Tompu: what does "blacklist the piv6" module mean? How do I do this? Thanks.
[03:30] <netpython> kikokos, looks like a metacity error
[03:31] <keithhhhh> Daverocks: the only thing that bothers me about ubuntu is I dont understand the magic behind installing software

[03:31] <knix> it is
[03:31] <Tompu> philipsmith: no guarantees :) but it worked for me
[03:31] <keithhhhh> Daverocks: ya hehe
[03:31] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: not true. just because it is for you does not mean it is
[03:31] <IndyBC> gnomefreak: ok :P

[03:32] <rredd4> in dapper, when i change the screen res, it shrinks the computer screen size instead of changing the res.  How can i fix this?
[03:32] <keithhhhh> Daverocks: ya thanks anyways ;)
[03:32] <Daverocks> keithhhhh: i agree, it helps tons to know what's going on behind the scenes in anything
[03:32] <IndyBC> gnomefreak: it does not auto-mount the usb devices
[03:32] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: it does mine
[03:32] <mamzers555> knix; also make sure you you have did "sudo apt-get update"
[03:32] <Daverocks> keithhhhh: uh, no problem. :P
[03:32] <IndyBC> gnomefreak: But it does not, mine. Dapper did.
[03:32] <jrib> rredd4: are you on a dell laptop by any chance?
[03:32] <rredd4> jrib yes
[03:32] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: it mounts my usb cd writer my usb stick and my camera
[03:33] <jrib> rredd4: there's an fn button that says Font, I think this is the one that changes the behavior
[03:33] <rredd4> jrib c810
[03:33] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: that sounds like a issue with your system not with all edgy systems
[03:33] <IndyBC> gnomefreak: It does not mount my usb stick and my mp3 player. Dapper did mount both of them.
[03:33] <kikokos> netpython how to do this?
[03:33] <gnomefreak> IndyBC: unplug them reboot than plug them in. this sounds like a hal issue

[03:54] <drivera90> OoberMick: I can use either, both, what have you. I read that ethernet is easier.
[03:54] <netpython> kikokos, VideoRam depends ofcourse on the amount of your graphics card/chip which can be different!
[03:54] <jrib> donfilipo: how did you install apache?
[03:55] <donfilipo> jrib with synaptic
[03:55] <jrib> donfilipo: did you install apache or apache2?
[03:55] <donfilipo> jrib apache2
[03:56] <jrib> donfilipo: ps -ef | grep apache
[03:56] <OoberMick> drivera90: usually if the device connects via ethernet it should "just work". If you want to try with the rpm you can use a program called alien "sudo apt-get install alien" but as I said ethernet should just work

[04:10] <elclemente> B-Minus: rmdir -rf /dir/to/purge
[04:11] <elclemente> B-Minus: Sorry! rm -rf /dir/to/purge
[04:11] <evilghost> elclemente:  He's in FTP
[04:11] <elclemente> Ups. Sorry :(
[04:12] <evilghost> B-Minus:  You may be to "QUOTE" a recursive delete, I'm not sure, I think not all FTP's support it so you have to CD to each directory and DELE wildcard, then RD the directory.
[04:12] <Keigo-kun> Is there a way to make a full ubuntu edgy installation to a minimal server install without reinstalling the system?
[04:12] <evilghost> elclemente:  NP
[04:13] <iami89> how do i setup 32 bit color depth?
[04:13] <evilghost> iami89:  In /etc/X11/xorg.conf you should be able to set the default depth.
[04:13] <zmm> I had problem with screen resolution, only 640X400 resolution was listed in my System->Preferences->Screen resolution. My xorg file was correct. I noticed that i have ati chipset. Therefore I installed drivers for this as suggested by someone on this channel. I ran sudo apt-get install linux-686 as explained on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI, since I've celloron P4 processor. But after installing this when I restarted ubuntu it got st
[04:13] <evilghost> iami89:  You'll need to be sudo'd or root to save this file.
[04:13] <ukaratay> Do you know solution of the bug ' soft lockup detected on CPU#0 ' ?
[04:14] <juan2342> whats the command or best way to run multiple instances of firefox (2.0) in kubuntu?
[04:14] <iami89> but its 32bit?
[04:14] <Keigo-kun> I basically want an ubuntu edgy install with pretty much nothing more than command interface, apt and such
[04:14] <Tompu> iami89: you cant go higher than 24bit
[04:14] <iami89> i've read that file but its not support 32bit
[04:14] <evilghost> Keigo-kun:  If you're already dapper server (basic) just adjust your /etc/apt/sources.list to point to edgy, run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
[04:14] <OoberMick> iami89: If your depth is 24 then you have "32-bit colour"
[04:14] <iami89> really?
[04:14] <evilghost> Keigo-kun:  err, apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:14] <erUSUL> iami89: yes
[04:15] <killown> hey How I add services to start during boot?
[04:15] <Tompu> iami89: 32bit is actually 24 with pseudotransparency and some other meta
[04:15] <killown> I want add scrpits
[04:15] <Keigo-kun> evilghost: No, I'm on a full edgy install with gnome
[04:15] <iami89> so i can change 24 -> 32?
[04:15] <ukaratay> nobody knows that
[04:15] <Tompu> iami89: 24 is 32.
[04:15] <iami89> nope
[04:15] <ukaratay> Do you know solution of the bug ' soft lockup detected on CPU#0 ' ?
[04:15] <jrib> iami89: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth
[04:15] <evilghost> Keigo-kun:  You could also pull the xorg packages/etc, or, you'd have to reinstall with a 'server' install
[04:15] <Tompu> iami89: 24 is the highest setting you can use, and it is the 'same' as windows 32 bit colour
[04:16] <iami89> but with my video card its not that
[04:16] <evilghost> zmm:  You're message got truncated, what happens after you resart?
[04:16] <Keigo-kun> evilghost, is there an easy way to do the server reinstall? A guide somewhere? Preferably one which uses a Dapper liveCD for example
[04:16] <zmm> But after installing this when I restarted ubuntu it got stuck at mounting root system. Please help me
[04:16] <Tompu> iami89: are you having a problem where something doesnt work because it requires 32bit?
[04:17] <iami89> yes
[04:17] <zoetrope666> can someone help me with a dvd problem ive got? i'm using dapper, and having a problem with jumpy dvd playback.
[04:17] <evilghost> Keigo-kun:  I honestly don't know, I know my father has reinstalled a few times but I've never had a dist-upgrade go wrong or really the need to reinstall with data preservation.  Sorry :(  I'd just use Synaptic or apt-get/dpkg to remove the packages you don't want.  Perhaps even a dpkg --purge {package name}
[04:17] <killown> hey How I add scripts to start during boot?
[04:17] <zoetrope666> i use totem with xine, and ive been on all the how-to sites, i've enabled dma, ive downloaded lib dvd css, and all the other codecs and stuff, and still the playback is still jumpy
[04:17] <evilghost> killown:  You can add them to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh or create a custom script in /etc/init.d and update-rc.d to execute it.
[04:18] <zoetrope666> and my system keeps crashing if i open another application at the same time as playing a movie.
[04:18] <rredd4> i am experiencing random keyboard and mouse freeze ups.  Where do I look to find out what is going on?
[04:18] <rredd4> dapper
[04:18] <killown> evilghost ok
[04:18] <jrib> iami89: what problem are you having exactly?
[04:18] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  Are you using xv or x11?
[04:18] <Tompu> killown: or you could add it to /etc/rc,local which is usually better for user scripts
[04:18] <salome> hmm.
[04:18] <zoetrope666> im not sure - how do i find out?
[04:18] <Jeruvy> rredd4: is 'top' indicated heavy load?
[04:18] <evilghost> rredd4:  APIC could be screwed up, have you tried booting with noapic?
[04:18] <killown> Tompu etc/rc.local in ubuntu?
[04:18] <salome> when will edgy become stable, is there a timeline?
[04:19] <TLE_02> I am, as usual having, trouble booting the live cd because my ati graphics card is not supported by the "ati" driver, but this time(edgy) the safe graphics mode doesn't help me as it use to (Dapper). Furthermore I noticed to my surprise that when I boot in safe graphics mode, it still has "ati" in the xorg.conf, I thought the Safe Graphics mode was supposed to replace that with "vesa". Actually I can't get the boot cd past the splash unless I add a vga opti
[04:19] <rredd4> Jeruvy top?
[04:19] <Tompu> killown: yes, /etc/rc.local
[04:19] <rredd4> evilghost no... will try tho
[04:19] <iami89> my screen get some strange sign like this ||||||||
[04:20] <salome> when will edgy become stable, is there a timeline?
[04:20] <killown> thanks
[04:20] <zoetrope666> evilghost: i'm not sure if im using xv or x11, how do i found out?
[04:20] <zoetrope666> *find
[04:20] <Tompu> iami89: what graphics card are you using, and where are the 'strange signs'?
[04:20] <iami89> which Ubuntu package is best { you think}?
[04:20] <|thunder> salome; it wont. edgy is not a LTS release like dapper.   long term support
[04:20] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  1 sec
[04:21] <zoetrope666> evilghost: okay, sorry. thanks!
[04:21] <salome> oh, I thought it was simply "the next version", and it would eventually stablize.
[04:21] <salome> so will there be another stable version?
[04:21] <salome> other than dapper?
[04:21] <JosefK> TLE_02: replacing 'ati' with 'radeon' used to work here
[04:21] <iami89> ATI RADEON 7000 series{ it have other name is "RADEON VE"}
[04:21] <zmm> evilghost:  I ran sudo apt-get install linux-686 as explained on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI, since I've celloron P4 processor. But after installing this when I restarted ubuntu it got stuck at mounting root system. Please help me
[04:21] <MattJ> salome: Probably the release after the next
[04:21] <MattJ> (I hope)
[04:21] <Tompu> JosefK: doesnt 'ati' just load the radeon module anyway?
[04:21] <salome> because if one more window just disappears without a trace, leaving nothing in any logfile, im goign to throw this computer out the window.
[04:21] <salome> :)
[04:21] <|thunder> salome; their all as stable as the next. but usually 4 or 5 releases between LTS's
[04:22] <salome> the release after next?  who decided on this sort of scheduling, and why is there nothing about it easily findable on ubuntu'
[04:22] <salome> s site?
[04:22] <JosefK> Tompu: no, they seem to rely on some shared features, but they're definitely not the same module
[04:22] <rredd4> Jeruvy  when i opened firefox, it froze
[04:22] <salome> ah
[04:22] <rambo3> how do i mount ext3 partition from terminal so any user can access it
[04:22] <salome> so its just unstable.
[04:22] <salome> dang.
[04:22] <JosefK> Tompu: ie. 'ati' used to hang my box, whereas 'radeon' didn't
[04:22] <donfilipo> jrib aha thank you....interesting htop shows it running nicely...thanks (actualy i supected i installed by mistake something else doing the same or similar as apache) thanks anyway...:)
[04:22] <Tompu> JosefK: when using a radeon 7000 (the only ati card ive ever owned), setting xorg to use 'ati' actually loads the radeon module
[04:22] <KnowledgEngi> hello
[04:23] <JosefK> Tompu: as I said above, they rely on some shared features
[04:23] <KnowledgEngi> i has problem with update manager program
[04:23] <JosefK> Tompu: but they're not identical
[04:23] <salome> bleh, its easier to just use debian than go through the hoops to get a big expensive support contract from ubuntu for 700 IBM blade servers anyhow.
[04:23] <KnowledgEngi> but i can update using synaptic
[04:23] <salome> maybe itll be usable in a couple years.
[04:23] <TLE_02> JosefK: Well i tried replacing it with vesa, and doing a sudo /etc/init.d/gdm retstart and still X failed to start, now vesa should work for sure right, but still my question is, sjouldn't it be vesa per standard when I boot in safe graphics ?
[04:23] <rredd4> Jeruvy  in top, xorg is taking the most cpu time  3 to 6 percent, thats the highest
[04:24] <JosefK> TLE_02: yes, probably, but if you're trying to fix it that hardly matters here?
[04:24] <JosefK> !bug
[04:24] <ubotu> If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug report at: http://bugs.ubuntu.com/ Bugs in/wishes for the bots can be filed at http://launchpad.net/products/ubuntu-bots
[04:24] <|thunder> salome; when the new releases come out they are stable enough. The LTS thing just means that dapper will be supported long into the future. As will the next next release if it is designated LTS. But that release will just be built upon edgy and whatever's next.
[04:24] <salome> oh
[04:24] <zmm> evilghost:  I ran sudo apt-get install linux-686 as explained on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI to enable ati driver, since I've celloron P4 processor. But after installing this when I restarted ubuntu it got stuck at mounting root system. Please help me
[04:24] <salome> nah, I report bugs all the time, but it seems that developers are more concerned with "desktop" type bugs than "server" type bugs
[04:24] <JosefK> salome: that was directed at TLE's desktop type bug :)
[04:24] <salome> ah ok
[04:24] <salome> :)
[04:25] <JosefK> solaris salome ;)
[04:25] <zmm> can i somehow remove that linux-686 package....will ubuntu work after that......
[04:25] <salome> solaris 10 is a blight...:P
[04:25] <JosefK> nah, migration was a hassle, but we managed it in the end
[04:26] <JosefK> (from 9->10 that is)
[04:26] <iami89> which Ubuntu package is best?
[04:26] <zoetrope666> evilghost: i have gone into synaptic and it looks like x11 is installed
[04:26] <rredd4> zmm go to synaptic base system, see if you have other kernels installed, if you then you can remove 686
[04:26] <ivan> hey guys
[04:26] <evilghost> Sorry I'm back
[04:27] <ivan> first booted ubuntu
[04:27] <Tompu> JosefK: http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man4/ati.4.html
[04:27] <cntb> anyone running  xen3.03 ?
[04:27] <evilghost> Well, sorry I was gone, phone rang.
[04:27] <ivan> looks nice so far
[04:27] <Tompu> JosefK: just for your future reference :)
[04:27] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  Let me look at the file where you decide what way the video is output
[04:27] <JosefK> Tompu: yes, but that doesn't say they're identical?
[04:27] <TLE_02> JosefK: I think it does. You see I think the actual problem is that my graphics card doesn't get detected properly. Now i might be able to fix that by adding a option at boot-time, but it is going to a hell trying to trouble shoot that if I have a driver problem problem on top of that
[04:27] <zoetrope666> evilghost: ok
[04:27] <JosefK> Tompu: and that doesn't explain why 'ati' consistently crashed my box, and 'radeon' didn't..
[04:28] <JosefK> TLE_02: not really, once you're installed it's fix-once and ignore it
[04:28] <Tompu> JosefK: ... obviously the wrapper driver detection magic was failing somehow
[04:28] <darrint> How do I begin troubleshooting a failure to resume from suspend (to ram)? I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 and recently installed edgy.
[04:28] <evilghost> zmm:  It could be doing an fsck because the mount count exceeded 30 or whatever is set it tune2fs, let it sit for a little bit.
[04:28] <Lone> how do you uninstall a program if it does not show up on the add/remove programs list?
[04:28] <ivan> later
[04:28] <Tompu> JosefK: but it really is only a wrapper that launches the relevant driver, in this case, radeon
[04:29] <JosefK> Tompu: thanks for the heads up, still seems unusual though
[04:29] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  What kind of video card do ou have?
[04:29] <knix> gnomefreak: more broken packages, libdvdcss, libdvdcss2, w32codecs
[04:29] <knix> =(
[04:29] <JosefK> knix: they're not part of Ubuntu
[04:29] <rredd4> lone apt-get remove packagename
[04:29] <gnomefreak> knix: they are not broken they are not in the repos

[04:30] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[04:30] <Tompu> oh. that told me
[04:30] <Lone> rred4: from the command line, right?
[04:30] <freexe> Suspend doesn't work on my Samsung Laptop, can someone help?
[04:30] <rredd4> Lone yes, type sudo first tho
[04:31] <rredd4> Lone sudo apt-get remove packagename
[04:31] <TLE_02> JosefK: Yes but i can't get it installed because I can't get X. I can try replacing it with radeon but I don't think it is going to work when it wont work with vesa.
[04:31] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  In /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf what does your vo= line look like?
[04:31] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  Are you using the Vesa driver too?
[04:31] <JosefK> TLE_02: if it isn't working with vesa, check the logs, the driver may not be the only problem in the xorg conf
[04:32] <zmm> rredd4: ubuntu didn't start after that, right now I'm running ubuntu from live cd. and synaptic package manager shows that linux-686 is not installed in this live ubuntu

[04:45] <TLE_02> JosefK: Tompu: I can tell from Dapper, which I am in right now, that the card is in the PCI:1:0:0 slot and gets loaded just fine in that slot in Dapper. But I can go back and gather some more info. So I'll go back and try some different drivers, how much info shall I gather EE and WW from xorg log and "lspci" anything else ?
[04:45] <Ardarandir> GigaClon: maybe there are some known problems with SSID's with spaces?
[04:45] <evilghost> Lone:  XMMS
[04:46] <Lone> evilghost: google? lol
[04:46] <Roger_The_Bum> francois: first the drivers, and if that doesn't work, then try the system
[04:46] <keithhhhh> can someone tell me exactly what  ./   command mean
[04:46] <evilghost> Lone:  sudo apt-get install xmms
[04:46] <Lone> !xmms
[04:46] <zmm> i installed linux-686 and restarted ubuntu but it got stuck at mount root during restarting. At the moment I am running ubuntu from live cd.  someone help plz

[04:46] <Lone> evilghost: right, forgot about that feature
[04:46] <JosefK> TLE_02: can you force 'rmmod ati' and 'rmmod radeon', they're not locking the slot?
[04:46] <GigaClon> maybe use a WAP key?
[04:46] <evilghost> Lone:  I'll verbally abuse you later ;)
[04:46] <Roger_The_Bum> Akuma_: the uname/pwd combo entered while installing
[04:47] <Ardarandir> GigaClon: thats not possible :-(
[04:47] <keithhhhh> Tompu: then what is the difference between ./sunbird    ./
[04:47] <Lone> evilghost: this is so much fun =D
[04:47] <evilghost> Lone:  :)
[04:47] <Tompu> keithhhhh: one of those will execute sunbird, the other will do nothing :)
[04:47] <francois> Roger_The_Bum, how can i reinstall the system without loosign everything ? or is that possible
[04:47] <Ardarandir> GigaClon: its a RaLink-Chip, RT61

[04:47] <Juhaz> Akuma_, you can boot to single user mode, troubleshoot or whatever it's called in grub in addition to the normal session
[04:48] <evilghost> zoet:  Yeah, I replied to your prvmsg
[04:48] <GigaClon> can you connect any wireless networks?
[04:48] <keithhhhh> Tompu: but why would it do nothing then wouldnt it be the same as ./   ?
[04:48] <Juhaz> Akuma_, then do "passwd youruser" and re-set it
[04:48] <Roger_The_Bum> Akuma_: try variations
[04:48] <TLE_02> JosefK: I don't understand what you mean. Are those commands something I should try or should I append the output of them ?
[04:48] <zoetrope666> sorry i closed off the prvmsg!
[04:48] <zoetrope666> what'd you say??
[04:48] <Tompu> !beryl > grant
[04:48] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  What's the vo= line say in /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf
[04:48] <Akuma_> Juhaz: thanks, i'll try that ...
[04:48] <Lone> i'm not getting any sound (4.1 speakers) is there anybody that could help me with this?
[04:48] <nolimitsoya> huw can i mount vmware partitions to extract files from a virtualmachine?
[04:49] <nolimitsoya> *how
[04:49] <zmm> i installed linux-686 package to enable ati drivers and restarted ubuntu but it got stuck at mount root during restarting. At the moment I am running ubuntu from live cd.  someone help plz...how can I revive my old ubuntu
[04:49] <JosefK> TLE_02: indeed, but try with radeon first
[04:49] <grant> hey tompu, been in there 3 times already and nobody ever bothers answering, either they aren't there or are choosing not to help, do you have any ideas?
[04:49] <Tompu> keithhhhh: perhaps i misunderstand your question. you put ./ in front of the name of the program you want to launch if it's in the current directory
[04:49] <erUSUL> !sound
[04:49] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If you are still having problems with sound, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  and http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin
[04:49] <GigaClon> Ardarandir, have you checked the ndiswrapper wiki?
[04:49] <Tompu> grant: i havent used beryl under ubuntu, sorry
[04:49] <Lone> wow, ubotu kicks ass
[04:49] <keithhhhh> Tompu: so does the .  mean run?
[04:49] <Tompu> grant: have you tried #beryl?
[04:49] <hoarycripple> n vanilla edgy eft, when trying to burn DVDs I get through about 300MB and then the entire system freezes.  DVD recorder is ATAPI LITE-ON LTR-52327S. Software used is either K3b, Nautilus, or commandline growisofs.  hdparm IO_support is 16 bit, unmaskirq off, dma off, readonly off readahead 256 (on). Interestingly, I keep getting this error every few seconds even if there is no cd/dvd in the drive: [17179811.752000]  hdf: cdrom_p
[04:49] <evilghost> Lone:  I'll second that.
[04:50] <Lone> !girls
[04:50] <zoetrope666> evilghost: it says vo=xv,sdl,x11
[04:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about girls - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:50] <Tompu> keithhhhh: . means this directory. .. means parent directory
[04:50] <keithhhhh> Tompu:  oh ya hehe
[04:50] <gustavnilsson> how to mount the ubuntu /dev manually_
[04:50] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  Same as mine.  Is that card you have just a really slow/bad card?
[04:50] <keithhhhh> Tompu:  Im still confused hehe
[04:50] <grant> em, no haven't tried that yet tompu, i'll give it a go, thanks
[04:50] <Tompu> gustavnilsson: if you're really wanting to add stuff to /dev, you need to use mknod. try man mknod
[04:51] <netpython> !beer
[04:51] <gustavnilsson> Tompu: my problem is that I need to run grub-install
[04:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about beer - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:51] <Ardarandir> GigaClon: i dontz need ndiswrapper... its a linux driver included in dpper and edgy
[04:51] <keithhhhh> Tompu:  Im trying to run sunbird   and if I type ./sunbird it works and if I type sunbird and it doesnt work
[04:51] <netpython> !lol
[04:51] <zoetrope666> evilghost: well, it seems to be? everytime i try to play a movie it jumps; if i play a movie in mplayer the sound and picture are out of sync; when i play a movie in any player i get a blue line accross the top of the screen; if i play a movie and try to run another application at the same time, my computer crashes completely
[04:51] <erUSUL> gustavnilsson: you don't /dev/ is populated by udev with the necesary dev files
[04:51] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about lol - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:52] <Tompu> keithhhhh: thats because it doesnt know where to look for sunbird if you dont include the ./
[04:52] <evilghost> zoetrope666:  Is that a PCI card?
[04:52] <zoetrope666> evilghost: ive read on a debian forum that users have had similar problems on similar computers to mine
[04:52] <nolimitsoya> !vmware-mount
[04:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vmware-mount - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:52] <Tompu> keithhhhh: otherwise, if i made a program called 'cd' that deletes all your files and left it in your directory
[04:52] <GigaClon> yeah but they do have tips to getting cards to work even if you don't need ndiswrapper
[04:52] <Tompu> keithhhhh: and you just typed cd
[04:52] <Tompu> keithhhhh: it'd delete your stuff instead of changing directory :)
[04:53] <gustavnilsson> erUSUL: so I don not need to mount /dev for grub-install in a chrooted env?
[04:53] <Akuma_> shouldnt i be able to boot from a livecd, mount the filesystem, find the password file and edit it?
[04:53] <zoetrope666> evilghost: yes device manager tells me its PCI
[04:54] <netpython> Akuma_, yes
[04:54] <keithhhhh> Tompu: so then what does / mean?
[04:54] <rredd4> root
[04:54] <Akuma_> netpython: what's the passwd file's name?
[04:54] <netpython> slah-forward?
[04:54] <netpython> sry
[04:54] <Tompu> keithhhhh: / means inside the directory
[04:54] <keithhhhh> Tompu: I guess Im getting confused thinking dos hehe
[04:54] <Tompu> keithhhhh: it lets us know we want something inside the directory instead of the directory itself
[04:55] <|thunder> wow, rudimentary nix
[04:55] <erUSUL> gustavnilsson: you do not mount /dev/ anymore as devfs is deprecated and got rid out of the kernel... if you need to make dev files you can use mknod directly
[04:55] <netpython> Akuma_, /etc/shadow
[04:55] <zmm> hey....anybody knows anything about my problem
[04:55] <Tompu> keithhhhh: if you have a dir called 'foo', and you want to get a file from inside it, you need to say foo/file
[04:55] <Akuma_> netpython: thanks
[04:55] <Tompu> keithhhhh: which means file is inside foo....
[04:55] <zmm> how can i revive my old ubuntu installation
[04:56] <netpython> Akuma_, np
[04:56] <keithhhhh> Tompu: thanks for explaining I think my brain will take a bit to get use to this....     my brain thinks dos when Im in the terminal  ;)
[04:56] <grieih__> hi, i'm getting "segmentation fault" everytime i try to install something.. how can I know whats wrong?
[04:56] <grieih__> using apt-get
[04:56] <Tompu> keithhhhh: not a problem. there are lots of good tutorials to teach you this stuff
[04:56] <keithhhhh> Tompu: the thing is I know what to do but I dont understand why hehe
[04:57] <keithhhhh> Tompu:  thanks again  ;)
[04:57] <Tompu> keithhhhh: take a look at http://www.linuxcommand.org/lts0020.php sometime :)
[04:57] <dfm> hi
[04:57] <keithhhhh> Tompu: ah cool
[04:57] <zobbi> do i need any special service from the provider to use ssh to access my computer remotely?
[04:57] <Tompu> keithhhhh: <3 bash
[04:57] <erUSUL> zobbi: you shouldn't
[04:58] <netpython> zobbi, nope
[04:58] <dfm> where can i find a list of kernel boot options with descriptions of what they do?
[04:58] <zobbi> someone told me that id need a public ip or something like this...
[04:58] <alesdoc> HI: do you know how i can monitor/check and eventually block the connections on an access point?
[04:58] <Tompu> zobbi: you need to know your WAN ip, as opposed to your LAN ip
[04:58] <Phenax> zobbi: No, all you need is the service running on your box, and the port you use for SSH to be open.
[04:58] <Jimmey> How can I forward all traffic on one port to another machine?
[04:59] <Tompu> Jimmey: does ubuntu have pf ?
[04:59] <zobbi> Tompu, i think my wan ip is dynamic... is this a problem?
[04:59] <Jimmey> Tompu, I don't know
[04:59] <Tompu> zobbi: www.no-ip.com
[04:59] <Phenax> zobbi: No, but whenever it changes you have to connect to your WAN IP
[05:00] <zobbi> hmm
[05:00] <rambo3> Jimmey, my guess would be iptables
[05:00] <netpython> dyndns
[05:00] <evilghost> Jimmey: You can also use redir, it works fairly well
[05:00] <nastas> hello to averyone
[05:00] <evilghost> Jimmey:  sudo apt-get install redir
[05:00] <Jimmey> evilghost, thanks
[05:01] <Tompu> zobbi: use a dynamic dns system like the one i linked you to to get a url (such as zobbi.no-ip.com) which will always point to your current ip address
[05:01] <nastas> anyone who knows about data recovery?
[05:01] <Tompu> zobbi: you install their software on your machine and it talks to their server every few hours to make sure they have your current ip
[05:01] <evilghost> Jimmey:  No problem bro.
[05:02] <zobbi> Tompu, i have my ip registered at a dns server and i tryed to use ssh but it didnt work... but i know almost nothing about these stuff... i have to read more
[05:03] <zobbi> Tompu it said "connection refused" i think
[05:03] <Phenax> zobbi: Sounds like your port wasn't open.
[05:03] <Tompu> zobbi: it's probably a good idea to read up on it, because it does pose a potential security risk
[05:03] <Gengerhim> hi all
[05:03] <Phenax> zobbi: If you have a firewall or router you'll need to open the port.
[05:03] <zoetrope666> evilghost: so do you think there are any likely solutions to my dilemma??
[05:03] <netpython> more likely
[05:04] <OoberMick> does anyone know if mplayer in multiverse is built with the live555 library?
[05:04] <kzimir> is this a good place to ask for help with a weird gnome problem on ubuntu??
[05:04] <zobbi> Phenax, hm ill try to figure this out... i have no ideia how to do it
[05:04] <Gengerhim> ubuntu
[05:04] <Phenax> zobbi: Do you have a router?
[05:04] <zobbi> Phenax, yep
[05:04] <Phenax> zobbi: You'll need to connect to your router and 'forward' the port.
[05:04] <Gengerhim> ubuntu
[05:04] <rizla> hello
[05:04] <nastas> Kzimir: yes
[05:04] <Phenax> zobbi: Have you ever accessed your router before?

[05:05] <rizla> poningru, i have a note ubuntu and a desktop win xp
[05:05] <Phenax> zobbi: Alright, give me a moment and we'll see if we can't forward it.
[05:06] <rizla> i can see and explore the note from desktop
[05:06] <poningru> you can?
[05:06] <rizla> poningru, but not the same from the notebook
[05:06] <Phenax> zobbi: sudo ifconfig | grep bcast

[05:06] <Phenax> zobbi: Give me the output of that command.
[05:06] <netpython> zobbi, normally you can access your router via your webbrowser like http://192.168.1.1
[05:06] <Gengerhim> ubuntu is a small debian
[05:06] <poningru> rizla: you can look through the ubuntu? or you can look through the windows?

[05:08] <Tompu> !find traceroute

[05:13] <maria> erUSUL, oh wow its already installed
[05:13] <Lone> Phenax: Oh... just remembered I have a Sound Blaster X-Fi... but http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=vendor-Creative_Labs#matrix says X-Fi doesn't have support yet.
[05:13] <kzimir> nastas: can i somehow learn from the save mode start up setting ?
[05:13] <kzimir> nastas: and how?
[05:14] <Tompu> erUSUL: does rdp client support vlc?
[05:14] <Lone> Phenax: Is there any way at all to get sound?
[05:14] <Phenax> Lone: Well, keep an eye on the new releases of ALSA.. That's unfortunate.
[05:14] <zobbi> Phenax, yeah let me just change this password first
[05:14] <kzimir> nastas: i also installed some small apps yesterday..
[05:14] <Phenax> Lone: Maybe OSS has support
[05:14] <mstaelens> I have mounted an ntfs drive in my computer with the script in the help docs but i do have the necessary permissions to view the contents - can anyone help?
[05:14] <zoetrope666> can anyone help me? im having trouble playing dvds on my computer. i have jumpy dvd playback, ive tried everything in the how-to online help guides like enabling dma, installing lib dvd css, and the rest of it, but it hasnt helped.  i use totem with xine. ive tried mplayer, gxine, ogle, and these seem to be worse than totem. in mplayer the sound and video are completely out of sync. when i play a film its all jumpy. and if i
[05:14] <zoetrope666> try to play a film and run another application my screen crashes.
[05:14] <kzimir> nastas: for instance yanc.. for tv out.. because nvtvout wasnt doing anything
[05:14] <Lone> Phenax: OSS...? You lost me there.
[05:14] <Tompu> erUSUL: vnc even. and it does
[05:14] <sheri_rao> need to run JVC GC-A33 webcam, can anyone help?
[05:14] <Phenax> OSS is another sound-system
[05:15] <nastas> Kzimir: i guess the problem is in the xorg.conf
[05:15] <floride1> hi
[05:15] <Phenax> Lone: Open Sound System
[05:15] <floride1>  i have a pb with my usb port
[05:15] <kzimir> nastas: or can i just reset everything step by step... yeah.. but i  "rm" the xorg and did a dpkg-reconfigure
[05:15] <Lone> Phenax: Where would I get to their database?
[05:15] <Phenax> Lone: It's probably not as great as ALSA, but you'd get sound in most applications with OSS and ALSA emulation.
[05:15] <kzimir> nastas: *xorg.conf
[05:16] <sheri_rao> need to run JVC GC-A33 webcam, can anyone help?
[05:16] <Phenax> Lone: Sorry, no idea.. Google it. I'd hate to say it but you sound pretty boned
[05:16] <nastas> Kzimir: once i tried to use xgl in my laptop
[05:16] <nastas> Kzimir: it didn't work
[05:16] <Lone> Phenax: Yeah... this sucks.
[05:16] <Phenax> Lone: I'll look around and see if I can find anything
[05:16] <zoetrope666> surely someone out there know ssomethig about fixing jumpy movies???
[05:16] <zoetrope666> :(
[05:17] <Phenax> Lone: It looks like ALSA is working on a driver for it
[05:17] <zobbi> Phenax, ok i found port forwarding
[05:17] <kzimir> nastas: but xgl was working before.... i am on a laptop, too
[05:17] <Phenax> zobbi: Forward the port 22 for the ip address 10.1.1.3
[05:17] <nastas> Kzimir: i had to rename the xorg.conf backup to xorg.conf
[05:17] <Tompu> Phenax: please, not port 22 :/
[05:17] <grant> hey guys quick question, how can i get a readout of which version of nvidia drivers are installed? thank
[05:17] <Lone> Phenax: Yeah, Creative Labs just updated the architecture for it, so I think it may be a while.
[05:17] <nastas> did you tried to rename the backup you made?
[05:17] <kzimir> nastas: that worked with you?
[05:18] <nastas> yep
[05:18] <grant> hey guys quick question, how can i get a readout of which version of nvidia drivers are installed? thank
[05:18] <kzimir> nastas: dam.. i tried that of course all ready
[05:18] <Phenax> Lone: If you really want to use Linux, do what I did; buy a cheap $30 Audigy 2.. Works great.
[05:18] <kzimir> nastas: its just weird that it says, it cant load the nvidiia driver in the non-save mode
[05:18] <nastas> Kzimir: first i removed the xorg.conf using the nano command
[05:19] <nastas> Kzimir: sorry
[05:19] <nastas> mistake
[05:19] <timpino> does anyone know if there is a linux app that let's you slipstream windows install cds?
[05:19] <kzimir> nastas: its ok.. any good resources for this may be?
[05:19] <zobbi> Phenax, hm how? this is fields written  "private ip" "protocol type" "private port"  "public port"
[05:19] <nastas> Kzimir: first i removed the xorg.conf and then i rename the backup of the xorg.conf
[05:19] <frandavid100> hiya!
[05:19] <zobbi> Phenax, there is*
[05:20] <frandavid100> does anyone know how to install the nvidia beta drivers in edgy?
[05:20] <Lone> Phenax: Meh, then I'd have to switch out every time I booted up with Vista.
[05:20] <Tompu> zobbi, you should set your private ip to your lan ip (10.1.1.whatever)
[05:20] <nastas> Kzimir: i wasn't in graphic mode
[05:20] <Lone> <- is a very avid gamer, Phenax
[05:20] <Tompu> zobbi: but this is important, it's a serious security issue to expose public port 22.
[05:20] <Tompu> zobbi: especially with a stock sshd install
[05:20] <Phenax> Lone: Just leave the Audigy 2 in there, there's not a huge difference between the performance -- they both support hardware mixing, one has slightly better quality that is likely not to be even supported in most games
[05:21] <frandavid100> #join /ubuntu-xgl
[05:21] <nastas> Kzimir: in a terminal type "sudo nano <the name of the backup>
[05:21] <frandavid100> oops
[05:21] <Tompu> frandavid100: heheh
[05:21] <Phenax> Lone: The only real performance decrease would be if you but a non-hardware mixing sound card, in which Window's audio would have to waste CPU cycles on using it's software mixer :)
[05:21] <nastas> Kzimir: without "
[05:21] <zobbi> Tompu, really? hm maybe i should do it right now
[05:21] <zoetrope666> can anyone help me? im having trouble playing dvds on my computer. i have jumpy dvd playback, ive tried everything in the how-to online help guides like enabling dma, installing lib dvd css, and the rest of it, but it hasnt helped.  i use totem with xine. ive tried mplayer, gxine, ogle, and these seem to be worse than totem. in mplayer the sound and video are completely out of sync. when i play a film its all jumpy. and if i
[05:21] <zoetrope666> try to play a film and run another application my screen crashes.
[05:21] <Lone> Phenax: Alright, I'll check it out.
[05:22] <Twohead> hi
[05:22] <Phenax> Lone: Alright, just look on the ALSA database for supported Audigy 2 models
[05:22] <nastas> Kzimir: xgl is working fine in your laptop?
[05:22] <Phenax> Lone: There are some Audigy 2's that don't have hardware mixing, which is lame.. so make sure it's a hardware mixing supported model :)
[05:22] <zobbi> Tompu, but if i would the id have to put the private ip 10.1.1.whatever, protocol type = all, private port = 22 and public port = ???
[05:22] <kzimir> nastas: yuo
[05:22] <zobbi> then*
[05:23] <Lone> Phenax: Sweet, props for the help man.
[05:23] <kzimir> nastas: yup.. it was
[05:23] <Phenax> Lone: And the name of the driver for the X-Fi is CA20k1, when the driver named ca20k1 comes out you'll have support ;)
[05:23] <Twohead> i have also a problem...i want to boot my ubuntu 6.10 cd and it hangs with the error message "ata1: error...timout...errorcodes"
[05:23] <nastas> Kzimir: why in my laptop isn't?
[05:23] <Lone> How big is the performance hit when VMing?
[05:23] <Tompu> zobbi: zobbi well, obviously dont actually put 'whatever', change that for your LAN ip address
[05:23] <geniusvicks> does anyone know where gwget downloads the files to?
[05:23] <kzimir> nastas: i guess in the save mode it still is
[05:23] <zobbi> Tompu hehheeh
[05:23] <Twohead> has anyone an idea?
[05:23] <kzimir> nastas: you are using beta drivers?
[05:23] <kzimir> nastas: for nvidia
[05:23] <Lone> Twohead: Are you getting to the main menu?
[05:23] <zobbi> Tompu, what about the public port?
[05:23] <Lone> Twohead: Where you choose what you want to do?
[05:24] <Twohead> yes....the i want to start the installation
[05:24] <nastas> Kzimir: nop. i have intel card :(
[05:24] <Lone> Twohead: OK
[05:24] <Tompu> zobbi: set the public port to a random number somewhere about 10000 and less than 65536
[05:24] <timpino> does anyone know if there is a linux app that let's you slipstream windows install cds?
[05:24] <sheri_rao> need to run JVC GC-A33 webcam, can anyone help?
[05:24] <Twohead> the boot screen comes and then....
[05:24] <Lone> Twohead: try it again, but this time select "check cd for defects"
[05:24] <Twohead> the cd is o.k.
[05:24] <kzimir> nastas: ah... may be thats why. how is the driver support?
[05:24] <Twohead> i checked it
[05:24] <Lone> Twohead: you have enough memory?
[05:24] <Twohead> i think so
[05:24] <Twohead> 1g
[05:24] <Tompu> zobbi: then you use that port when you try to ssh into the system
[05:24] <Twohead> the HD is a SATA drive
[05:25] <kzimir> nastas: have to reboot my system.. trying out something new.
[05:25] <nastas> Kzimir: ok
[05:25] <Lone> I mena virtual memory, as in your memory sticks
[05:25] <kzimir> nastas: see you in a bit.. thanx for helping anyway
[05:25] <Lone> Twohead: When was your computer made?
[05:25] <Twohead> the previous versions of ubuntu still work..but this release doesnt wnat to boot
[05:25] <Twohead> 2003

[05:26] <dberg> Gnome wouldn't start when I booted this morning.  Just a blank screen then a white text box in the upper left corner.
[05:26] <dberg> Any ideas what broke?

[05:26] <Digichrome> Hey gang. Trying to run the live CD but can't get past my monitor complaining that it "can not display this mode". Any suggestions?
[05:26] <Tompu> zobbi: the steps in section 5 will make you pretty secure so long as you dont go telling random people in irc your login names ;)
[05:26] <Twohead> Lone: o.k.
[05:26] <Lone> Digichrome: Video card?
[05:26] <Digichrome> lone: nvidia 5600
[05:27] <Lone> Digichrome: Look up for me (i assume you're using another computer?) how much graphics memory that has
[05:27] <Tompu> zobbi: you only need to the editing, not the installing, since im sure you already installed ssh
[05:27] <richee> !java
[05:27] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java  -  For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
[05:27] <Digichrome> lone: with a dell 24" LCD.
[05:27] <zobbi> Tompu, yeah
[05:27] <Lone> twohead: so run the memory test when you get to the boot selection page
[05:27] <Edulix> hi
[05:27] <Digichrome> lone: 128MB on the card
[05:27] <Edulix> does ubuntu desktop installer support lvm?
[05:27] <Twohead> Lone: my hardware is o.k...
[05:27] <Edulix> if not, what could i do then?
[05:27] <Lone> Digichrome: Hmm.... I think your graphics card is OK, I'm not really sure
[05:28] <Tompu> zobbi: once ssh is limited to only allow certain user logins, you should be pretty safe
[05:28] <Lone> Digichrome look on the Ubuntu wiki
[05:28] <Lone> Twohead: hmmm
[05:28] <Digichrome> lone (and others): I seen support posts where there are suggestions for reconfiguring xorg.conf with a different refresh rate. that's fine but I can't install ubuntu to be able to edit it.
[05:28] <Tompu> zobbi: if you want to have long term ssh access available though, you should look into something like swatch
[05:28] <Digichrome> How can I change the xorg conf if running from live?
[05:28] <Edulix> noone has used evms/lvm? moroons :P
[05:28] <Twohead> Lone: i think that is a problem with the ata/sdata controller an the HD
[05:29] <Twohead> -d
[05:29] <Tompu> zobbi: which helps to stop people brute forcing your passwords
[05:29] <Lone> Twohead: What BIOS do you have?
[05:29] <Twohead> newest
[05:29] <Twohead> @lone
[05:29] <Tompu> zobbi: though im sure someone more familiar with ubuntu could give you a more ubuntu solution :)

[05:30] <Lone> Twohead: OK, go into Setup and check to see if your drives are being identified

[05:30] <Twohead> Lone: yes, they are identified
[05:31] <Tompu> !ssh > zobbi

[05:31] <|thunder> Kawaii-Panda; try apt-cache search alarm.clock

[05:31] <Kawaii-Panda> thanks |thunder: i'll try that
[05:31] <Lone> Twohead: Well, this is where my limited suggestions end... my only other thought would be to open your computer and check to see if all the cables are fully inserted into your CD/DVD drive
[05:32] <Lone> Twohead: that was my problem
[05:32] <zobbi> Tompu cool
[05:32] <Twohead> Lone: i checked it also...
[05:32] <Akuma_> i need to mount a specific file, located on an ntfs partition, is that possible or i have to mount the full fs?
[05:33] <Twohead> Lone: so i habe no idea, what i can do....that the reason to come here#
[05:33] <Twohead> have
[05:34] <Lone> Twohead: Ask the question again, maybe somebody with more knowledge can help you.
[05:34] <Twohead> o.k, i#ll try...and thx for your time
[05:34] <Lone> Twohead: No problem.
[05:34] <Twohead> 2nd round: i have a problem...i want to boot my ubuntu 6.10 cd and it hangs with the error message "ata1: error...timout...errorcodes"

[05:47] <Tompu> theplatypus: you win the bizarro problem of the day award
[05:47] <|thunder> ailean; goto terminal and do 'ps -A | grep -i fire' get the id # and do 'kill #' replacing # with the PID
[05:47] <wallander> why
[05:47] <ailean> |thunder, where do i get the PID? is that under "ID" on system monitor?
[05:48] <wallander> why
[05:48] <theplatypus> Tompu: This occured after update-manager notified me of needed updates this morning. Any ideas on how to fix it?
[05:48] <|thunder> ailean; not sure. thats wher the ps -A come in
[05:48] <wallander> why
[05:48] <ailean> k :)
[05:48] <ailean> thanks |thunder
[05:48] <wallander> why
[05:48] <Lil-Abner> I want to buy a book about using shell, which beginner's book gives the most fundamental instructions? And mean really basic! :-)
[05:48] <|thunder> ailean; np
[05:49] <|thunder> linux for dummies
[05:49] <wallander> why
[05:49] <Gumby> Lil-Abner: shell scripting for dummies?
[05:49] <ailean> yeah, still didn't work |
[05:49] <ailean> |thunder, even
[05:49] <wallander> why
[05:49] <Tompu> theplatypus: sorry. thats just too random for me to even guess at
[05:49] <Lil-Abner> LOL, that sounds about right for me, | Thunder! Thanks.
[05:49] <wallander> why
[05:49] <ailean> it should work...
[05:49] <Elko> it's been a really long time since I've held a book in my hands :P
[05:49] <Tompu> theplatypus: where do you see it? when x is starting up?
[05:49] <wallander> why

[05:50] <Ayabara> is anyone using the default movie player in ubuntu, or is vlc and media player the way to go?
[05:50] <wallander> why
[05:50] <raghu206> whats the keyboard shortcut for switching between tabs in gayche
[05:50] <theplatypus> Tompu : no after trying to run glxgears. Everything has been working fine for almost two years and then this random thing happened this morning
[05:50] <Tompu> Ayabara: depends what you want to watch :p if totem works fine for you, stick with it
[05:50] <Lil-Abner> I've tried using the online tutorials, but my attention span is lacking doing it that way. I like the idea of a book beside me as I do the practices.
[05:50] <Tompu> theplatypus: glxinfo | grep direct
[05:50] <wallander> why
[05:51] <jrib> Ayabara: totem-xine is pretty good imo.  However, I prefer mplayer with no gui
[05:51] <wallander> why
[05:51] <jrib> wallander: stop
[05:51] <jvai> help, my scandisk cruser usb stik wont mount
[05:51] <wallander> jrib sucks
[05:51] <wallander> why
[05:52] <Tompu> Ayabara: vlc really does play everything though. i just opened an .iso of a kvcd and it worked, no questions asked. no mounting, no extracting, no fuss
[05:52] <theplatypus> Tompu : Same error as before with the addition of "Direct rendering : Yes"
[05:52] <Gumby> wow, parents shouldnt let 9 year olds have access to the PC without supervision
[05:52] <wallander> why
[05:52] <Ayabara> Tompu: tried fiddling a bit with totem to set post prcessing quality and hotkeys, but I found no preferences for it. I installed kaffeine and like that one better, actually
[05:52] <jvai> i got totem xine playing all my media, but the .mov filez play in the browser
[05:52] <wallander> why
[05:52] <wallander> why
[05:52] <wallander> why
[05:53] <Lil-Abner> Anyways, back to my original question about EasyUbuntu. The message comes up when I use the updater that:W: GPG error: http://packages.freecontrib.org dapper Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F120156012B83718
[05:53] <Tompu> Ayabara: totem is supposed to be SuperEasy. you wont find any real settings inside, you need to mess with gstreamer for that
[05:53] <Ayabara> Tompu: I always have vlc installed, but seldom use it as the default player. when my default player won't play a movie, I throw it at vlc :-)
[05:53] <kzimir> i am back
[05:53] <wallander> why
[05:53] <cosmolax> ...
[05:53] <Tompu> Ayabara: same here
[05:53] <wallander> why
[05:53] <Tompu> Ayabara: but i keep mplayer around because i use mencoder a lot
[05:53] <Tompu> theplatypus: you need to pick through your Xorg.0.log
[05:54] <Tompu> theplatypus: search through it for WW and EE
[05:54] <faceton> Lil-Abner, http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf
[05:54] <Ayabara> jrib: I like mplayer too, but last time I missed hotkeys for zoom 50/100/200%. has that arrived yet?
[05:54] <theplatypus> Tompo: I haven't rebooted since that error I'm afraid all will be lost
[05:54] <jvai> u can even select off "show controls" in totem to give it the mplayer look
[05:54] <wallander> why
[05:55] <wallander> why
[05:55] <Lil-Abner> OK, thanks, faceton, I'll go there and check it out. bye all.
[05:55] <jvai> help, my scandisk cruser usb stik wont mount
[05:55] <wallander> why

[05:55] <kuckus> Hi
=== vita_ is now known as Belisarivs
[05:55] <wallander> why$
[05:55] <Belisarivs> Hi all.
[05:55] <Tompu> theplatypus: just open /var/log/Xorg.0.log in any editor
[05:55] <wallander> why
[05:55] <jrib> Ayabara: not really sure about that
[05:56] <Tompu> wallander: can I ask you a question?
[05:56] <jvai> brb uall  i'm gonna post in the forums 4 help on this usb prob
[05:56] <kuckus> If for some reason my intel wireless (ipw3945) doesn't work any more (i.e. loading the module while the switch is on causes the system to freeze..), what would I best do restore it to a working state?
[05:57] <wallander> yeah, tompu
[05:57] <kuckus> Is there any way to have the installer's auto-detection run again or something to that effect?
[05:57] <Ayabara> jrib: ok. I think kaffeine looks good. Guess I will use vlc, kaffeine and mplayer until I find my flavour :-)
[05:57] <Belisarivs> I have a problem with Dapper and wifi card prism. Linux doesn't connect to the internet automatiacally even though it was previously set and woking. What should I do? Is it possible to update Dapper to Edgy (not reinstall)?
[05:57] <Tompu> wallander: why?
[05:57] <jrib> Ayabara: yeah, that's the best approach
[05:57] <kuckus> (I'm on Edgy)
[05:57] <wallander> because life is a cookie
[05:57] <Ayabara> hehe. saw that one coming :-)
[05:57] <Tompu> wallander: why?
[05:58] <|thunder> try this all -- /ignore *!*@84-73-113-17.dclient.hispeed.ch CHAN QUIET
[05:58] <crazy_penguin> Tompu: it's a bot, i think. just ignore on it
[05:58] <crazy_penguin> he got tired answering :P
[05:58] <Tompu> :)
[05:59] <Belisarivs> None?
[05:59] <theplatypus> Tompu : the only WW were related to a font path. I don't see any EE
[05:59] <kittu> hi chanduuu unnavaa?
[05:59] <kittu> chandu unnava?
[05:59] <Tompu> theplatypus: have you rebooted since your upgrade?
[05:59] <timpino> how do I run a .pl script?
[05:59] <kittu> hi chandu
[06:00] <kittu> hi chandu
[06:00] <Gumby> timpino: most likely perl  scriptname.pl
[06:00] <chandu> hai kish
[06:00] <timpino> ahhhh perl
[06:00] <timpino> :P
[06:00] <timpino> thanks
[06:00] <theplatypus> Tompu : It wasn't an upgrade just a few packages and no I haven't. I believe things will be hosed if I do
[06:01] <Tompu> do you know what packages you upgraded?
[06:01] <kuckus> have an idea regarding my wireless, anyone?
[06:01] <Tompu> theplatypus: sorry, do you know what packages you up'd?
[06:01] <kuckus> I really don't want to reinstall...
[06:01] <theplatypus> Tompo: update manager notified me of 3 one of which was nvidia-glx. I can't remember the other 2
[06:01] <rooti1> hey, got a question installing nvidia drivers ... did it like discribed in the docs but when i want to enable the drivers it says that the kernel drivers cannot be found ... but i installed the kernel-common drivers ... what do i do wrong ?
[06:02] <kittu> hi everybody,, plzz help me,, i cannot install ubuntu 6.06 on my pc(256mb ram, p4 2.26hz processor)
[06:02] <Tompu> theplatypus: i'm pretty sure your problem will resolve itself just by rebooting :)
[06:02] <Tompu> theplatypus: of course, i cant guarantee that
[06:02] <rooti1> !nvidia
[06:02] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:02] <Tompu> theplatypus: but it doesnt explain why you're getting a phpError
[06:03] <netpython> rooti1, normally apt-get install nvidia-glx && audo nvidia-glx-config enable is enough
[06:03] <Tompu> theplatypus: that's just crack-crazy
[06:03] <yeager> nu s..
[06:03] <jrib> theplatypus: the latest nvidia-glx upgrade seems to be causing problems for some.  Someone was locked out of X earlier.  If this happens to you, fallback to the 'nv' driver
[06:03] <kittu> hi everybody,, plzz help me,, i cannot install ubuntu 6.06 on my pc(256mb ram, p4 2.26hz processor)
[06:03] <netpython> sudo
[06:03] <chandu> what happened?
[06:03] <rooti1> netpython ill try
[06:03] <kittu> its just giving me blank screen and hang
[06:03] <netpython> k
[06:03] <Trenty> Anyone know where to find /etc/fstab?
[06:04] <omerlh> Hello
[06:04] <theplatypus> Thinking about uninstalling both nvidia and nvidia-glx to see what happens
[06:04] <Yggdrasil> can somone tell me if theres a 2.6.18 kernel i can easily install for dapper ?
[06:04] <timpino> var har man desktop menu entries i gnome?
[06:04] <timpino> sorry
[06:04] <omerlh> How do install C headers files?
[06:04] <timpino> where do i have th desktop menu entries in gnome?
[06:04] <theplatypus> can't believe there isn't a history in update-manager
[06:04] <Mahmoud85> Trenty : sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[06:04] <daveyj> i'm sure a million people have the same problem i'm having
[06:05] <TheGateKeeper> kittu: completing the install?
[06:05] <daveyj> dist-upgrade just broke my x :(
[06:05] <chandu> hey can ani body help us
[06:05] <chandu> hi everybody,, plzz help me,, i cannot install ubuntu 6.06 on my pc(256mb ram, p4 2.26hz processor)
[06:05] <theplatypus> Found someone else with the same problem
[06:05] <epsilon_> chand what is exactly the problem?
[06:05] <kees-jan> chandu: you must be related to kittu :-)
[06:05] <kittu> yess, ,chandu is my friend
[06:05] <chandu> ya
[06:06] <chandu> plz help us sir
[06:06] <Mahmoud85> daveyj : try from the terminal sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[06:06] <kees-jan> still
[06:06] <kees-jan> "just sits there with a blank screen" is not very informative :-)
[06:06] <kees-jan> What did you try
[06:06] <kees-jan> what happened
[06:06] <kees-jan> why do you think this is wrong
[06:06] <kees-jan> etc?
[06:06] <GaryS> anyone have any luck with installing php 5.2 or is there an apt-get I'm missing out on
[06:06] <kittu> it loaded kernel and then the installation cannot proceed :(
[06:06] <alecjw> is there a graphical program whihc will allow me to pause downloads? i know that wget can do this, but i'd like to avoid commandline if possible.
[06:06] <daveyj> Mahmoud85: already the newest version
[06:06] <rooti1> when installing the nvidia drivers and doing nvidia-glx-enable i get this error: Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[06:06] <rooti1> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[06:06] <kees-jan> why can't it?
[06:07] <rooti1> and the kernel is installed!
[06:07] <theplatypus> rootil: does the nvidia kernel revision number match the nvidiaglx revision number
[06:07] <boink> GaryS: php 5.2 is not in Edgy. maybe in the next release
[06:07] <rooti1> theplatypus: gonna have a look
[06:08] <kittu> may be,, do I need to have more ram?
[06:08] <kees-jan> nope
[06:08] <nutty> 
[06:08] <kees-jan> at least, debian sarge is running just fine, so so should dapper :-)
[06:09] <boink> dapper does run fine .. most of the time :)
[06:09] <kees-jan> why do you think installation cannot proceed?
[06:09] <slipttees> desable halt in users?
[06:10] <Mahmoud85> daveyj : you modified the sources.list to have edgy instead of dapper ?
[06:10] <TehUni> i've got ubuntu installed on a drive. I have an identical drive that i would like to combine with it to make a raid1 array. is there any way to do that without reinstalling?
[06:10] <d0uglas> hi.. what's the mount command for an ipod the name of which shows up as /dev/disk/by-label/DOUGLAS or in the past as /dev/sda2?
[06:10] <epsilon_> @$$  
[06:10] <daveyj> Mahmoud85: this is a relatively fresh 6.10 install
[06:11] <daveyj> this just happened with the last dist-upgrade i did 10 minutes ago
[06:11] <rooti1> theplatypus: dunno i dont think that the versions are matching: 20051028 is the kernel and 2.6.17.6-1 is the glx
[06:11] <rooti1> but there are no updates
[06:12] <theplatypus> rooti1 : try running glxgears
[06:12] <rooti1> glxgears ? sry i am very new to ubunto where do i find this ?
[06:12] <Lone> TehUni: When you find an answer to that question, tell me, because I've been wondering the same thing for a while.
[06:12] <theplatypus> just type it into  a terminal
[06:12] <rooti1> uh yeah i see a result
[06:13] <theplatypus> is it an error
[06:13] <theplatypus> ?
[06:13] <TehUni> k
[06:13] <rooti1> no that are the gears :D
[06:13] <cryptonic> i am installing ubuntu edgy 32bit edition and i am at the partitioning section, make 2 partitions off the one drive and be able to access the secondry partition in nautilus by default withought having to add mounting commands later?
[06:13] <rooti1> but they are running deathly slow
[06:14] <daveyj> :(
[06:15] <epsilon_> cryptonic: gnome mounts partitions automatically. you can read but not write ntfs partitions by default.
[06:16] <rooti1> theplatypus: if i see the gears. what does it mean ? does it mean the drivers do work? but why are them that slow
[06:16] <epsilon_> rootil: glxgears should write some benchmark info to the terminal
[06:16] <theplatypus> rootil: it means you are not having the same problem that I am. lol
[06:16] <cryptonic> it didnt last time, does it matter if the swap in between the two partitions?
[06:16] <ace> hi all
[06:17] <ace> I seem to have problems with sound
[06:17] <rooti1> theplatypus: hehe thats funny, but the drivers still are not working lol
[06:17] <ace> sorry
[06:17] <ace> wrong channel
[06:17] <theplatypus> rootil: have you edited the xorg file
[06:18] <cryptonic> epsilon_ : does it matter if the swap in between the two partitions?
[06:18] <rooti1> theplatypus: i dindt edit a thing, the only steps i did is installing nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-config enable and got an error
[06:18] <epsilon_> epsilon_ : no (it will see them anyway). what type of partitions do you have? one ubuntu, one swap, and the third?
[06:19] <epsilon_> (lol.)
[06:19] <daveyj> why'd the new kernel update kill my nvidia drivers?
[06:19] <cryptonic> well im thinking fat32
[06:19] <rooti1> theplatypus: should i do it ?
[06:19] <cryptonic> for the third
[06:19] <epsilon_> daveyj: if you have nvidia.com drivers, it may.
[06:19] <daveyj> so how do i fix this problem?
[06:19] <daveyj> i just wanna get my X back :(
[06:19] <cryptonic> i dont know how much space i should leave for the swap either?
[06:19] <squidly> reinstall the drivers
[06:20] <daveyj> i tried that
[06:20] <epsilon_> cryptonic: it will see them. i have 5 ntfs partitions on 2 harddrives, and it sees them.
[06:20] <daveyj> but it didnt work
[06:20] <squidly> what does it say when you reinstalled it?
[06:20] <theplatypus> at a terminal type "cd /etc/X11" then "ls -a" you should see a xorg.conf file. find the video card driver line and change it from "nv" to "nvidia"
[06:20] <epsilon_> daveyj: install not only new kernel, but new kernel haedaers, THEN install nvidia.
[06:20] <cryptonic> do i need to use extended partitions?
[06:20] <theplatypus> excuese me"NVIDIA"
[06:20] <rooti1> kk
[06:21] <daveyj> what kernel headers? (i'm a noob)
[06:21] <epsilon_> cryptonic: how much ram do you have? and how big is you harddrive?
[06:21] <sizzam> cryptonic: i used all primary partitions, i set my swap to the same size as the amount of ram i have
[06:21] <squidly> can anyone tell me what exacly scrollkeeper is?
[06:21] <cryptonic> 250gig drive, 512meg ram
[06:21] <boink> !scrollkeeper
[06:21] <ubotu> scrollkeeper: A free electronic cataloging system for documentation. In component main, is optional. Version 0.3.14-11ubuntu6 (edgy), package size 181 kB, installed size 3768 kB
[06:21] <epsilon_> cryptonic: 1,5 gig is not much on your hd but more than enough for swap.
[06:21] <sizzam> squidly: ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems. It manages documentation metadata (as specified by the OMF) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to find, sort, and search the document catalog.
[06:22] <theplatypus> back in a bit
[06:22] <cryptonic> lol, i had 12gig swap on my last install :D
[06:22] <squidly> sizzam: ahh thank you
[06:22] <epsilon_> daveyj: now you have nvidia.com drivers? or ubuntu package (nvidia-glx) driverS?
[06:22] <daveyj> nvidia.com
[06:22] <daveyj> says its looking for the kernel source but cant find it
[06:22] <epsilon_> cryptonic: no, you dont need that much :D :D 2-3 times your ram is enough
[06:23] <epsilon_> daveyj: yes. in synaptic, find the apripriate kernel headers.
[06:23] <epsilon_> for example, if your kernel is "linux-generic", then you need "linux-headers-generic". or what.
[06:23] <cryptonic> so i create 2 primary partitions and a swap, not one primary 1 swap and an extended logical partition?
[06:24] <austin_> heya is this the place to come to ask about help?
[06:24] <daveyj> is there an easy way to see which kernel i'm running? :)
[06:24] <epsilon_> daveyj: but leave that. install ubuntu nvidia drivers. a kernel update wont mess that up.
[06:24] <epsilon_> daveyj: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[06:24] <daveyj> well i was running beryl so i think i needed the beta drivers
[06:25] <epsilon_> what is beryl? :S a beta ubuntu?
[06:25] <austin_> heya, could someone give me a hand with understanding managing users and groups?
[06:25] <squidly> austin_: what do you need?
[06:25] <squidly> user's are user account
[06:25] <squidly> groups are access lists for the user accounts.
[06:25] <austin_> well, i'm just trying to understand how to configure them
[06:25] <squidly> ahh vipw
[06:25] <slipttees> how disable the option halt of all the user of ubuntu less my user?
[06:25] <austin_> I can't seem to find a tutorial
[06:25] <cryptonic> epsilon_ : so i create 2 primary partitions and a swap, not one primary 1 swap and an extended logical partition?
[06:26] <boink> man chown is a good start
[06:26] <austin_> basically I just want to know what all the groups mean
[06:26] <squidly> austin_: man passwd && man shadow and man pam
[06:27] <epsilon_> cryptonic: WAAAAA.
[06:27] <epsilon_> you have a windows?
[06:27] <epsilon_> for linux you can have two primary partitions that doesnt matter. it only matters for tha window$ sh!t.
[06:27] <slipttees> somebody?
[06:27] <netpython> austin_, http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/unix-or-linux-commands-for-changing-user-rights.html
[06:28] <nolimitsoya> does anyone know hot to mount vmware virtual hddrives to extract data tothe host machine?
[06:29] <sobersabre> hi!
[06:29] <austin_> thank you netpython
[06:29] <netpython> austin_, you are welcome
[06:29] <sobersabre> I have seen occurence of bug 64848
[06:29] <slipttees> how disable the option halt of all the user of ubuntu less my user?
[06:29] <epsilon_> cryptonic: is it okay now? :S
[06:29] <vivabenfica> hi all
[06:29] <sobersabre> I don't understand how can I resolve it: the package k3d doesn't install. it gets stuck
[06:30] <vivabenfica> need some help partitioning my laptop to triple boot (xp, ubuntu, suse/mandriva)
[06:30] <sobersabre> There's patch to k3d source package, but binary is in under-installed state
[06:30] <epsilon_> now i ask: my ubuntu doesnt turn off when i press "turn off", just goes to an ubuntu loading screen.
[06:30] <sobersabre> How can I resolve this ?
[06:30] <squidly> nolimitsoya: you have to mount make it network mountable in you vm drive
[06:30] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: first install windows, then comes ubuntu and suse.
[06:32] <cryptonic> epsilon_ : i dont have windows running atm nor do i want it but i might need it if i want to use my mp3 player and shit like that so il go with the extended partition hoping that it shows up in nautilus
[06:32] <AskHL> Hmm, I want to play a completely normal movie DVD. None of the DVDs I have tested will mount properly. Do I need something in particular for this to work? Using Dapper (still)
[06:32] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ windows came pre-installed without an install cd (just a recovery one), so using the ubunto install/live CD 6.06, i reduced the xp partition. now i have a 10 GB xp partition, a 300 MB unknown (xp recovery maybe?), and the rest is free space.
[06:32] <epsilon_> cryptonic: it doesnt matter. you can make primary partitions i have them too.
[06:33] <AskHL> To elaborate, the system attempts to mount the DVD, and it recognizes the DVD name. However the directory is empty!
[06:33] <sobersabre> hmm...
[06:33] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: i think you can delete that 300 mb, windows doesnt make recovery partitions. how much free space do you have?
[06:34] <[gen2] niki> hmm
[06:34] <[gen2] niki> can someone tell me if there are device drivers for buffalo usb devices?
[06:34] <vivabenfica> so, so far 2 primary partitions. since each boot partition for ubuntu and other linux distro must be a primary partition, that leaves me no more partitions (max is 4) for swap space and /home, /usr partitions for each liinux distro
[06:34] <[gen2] niki> usb wifi54 devices :o
[06:34] <vivabenfica> epsilon: have 70 GB free
[06:36] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: then make half ubuntu half suse. there is only one thing i dint know if the two linux can use one (say 1,5 gb) swap partition.
[06:36] <tuxtheslacker> can someone help me out that has an understanding of cron?
[06:36] <TLE_02> epsilon_: Two linux installations can use the same swap drive
[06:36] <tuxtheslacker> or bash scripting?
[06:37] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker do u have a cron job that doesn't work or what ?
[06:37] <fishsticks> can some one explain the new kernel names? is -k7 now -generic?
[06:37] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, I need to know how ot get a cron job to cycle through until it finds a valid download.
[06:38] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, or even if I do this with scripting it would work, but I have a server for which I need to download the symantec update file daily... and I need to write a scrip thtat will download it.
[06:38] <grant> hey guys quick question, how can i get to a pure console? i.e. shutdown x and just have a console?
[06:38] <tuxtheslacker> problem being the naming scheme is a little weird.
[06:38] <epsilon_> TLE_02, thanks.
[06:38] <epsilon_> vivabenfica now you see: 35 gb suse, 33 gb ubuntu and 2 gb swap.
[06:38] <epsilon_> OR, you can make a 40 gb HOME partition, so you can reach the same docs and prefs on both linuxes.
[06:38] <epsilon_> anyway why do you need two? :)
[06:38] <epsilon_> grant: press ctrl-alt-f1 (f2,f3... f7 is X)
[06:39] <grant> epsilon, need to actually shut down x though
[06:39] <epsilon_> grant: ohh. ctral-alt-f1, then as root: init 3. to turn back to X init 5.
[06:39] <epsilon_> (ubuntu froze when i tried that :( )
[06:39] <dan_> hey guys, quick question. if i want to download a tar file and compile it into a program, what are the steps? i know this is an elementary question, but i don't really know how? also, where should i save the file?
[06:40] <sugoruyo> hi all
[06:40] <grant> thanks
[06:40] <vivabenfica> epsilon - summarizing. winxp, 300MB mystery, boot for ubuntu, boot for other. that leaves me no space for /home, swap, because the two linux boot partitions need to be primary, right?
[06:40] <rooti1> i still cant install nvidia drivers getting error:
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
[06:40] <rooti1> Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed
[06:40] <rooti1> the nvidia driver for your running kernel.
[06:40] <aoupi> is it possible to mount one HD to two places, like I want to mount /dev/hdb3 into both /one/path and into /another/path at the same time, symlinking wont do since people will be chrooted inte /one/path and other users into /another/path
[06:40] <tuxtheslacker> is there a bash scripting channel anywhere that I could get on to ask this?
[06:40] <rooti1> any ideas ?
[06:40] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker then: what have you done, and what doesn't work ?
[06:40] <fishsticks> dan_, first install the "build-essential" package
[06:40] <Buzzzz> hello all is there a way to get nvidia kernel driver to work on a 64bit system?
[06:40] <dan_> i think i've installed that--i'll check
[06:40] <sugoruyo> can someone answer a question regarding nVidia drivers?
[06:40] <rooti1> Buzzzz: got the same problem
=== TRX is now known as h4x3d
[06:40] <sugoruyo> they don't seem to work
[06:40] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, I don't know where to start :-/.
[06:40] <sobersabre> hmm... i think a word "bash" should appear in the name of the channel.
[06:41] <dan_> no, it wasn't installed
[06:41] <dan_> it's going now...
[06:41] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker: google on "bash tutorial"
[06:41] <rooti1> Buzzzz: do you get the error with the kernel driver ?
[06:41] <fishsticks> dan_, that's got the compilers you'll need
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, I have the script started.
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> #!/bin/bash
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> wget http://www.spybotupdates.com/updates/files/spybotsd_advcheck.exe
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> wget http://download.lavasoft.com/public/defs.zip
[06:41] <dan_> thanks fishsticks
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> oops!
[06:41] <Buzzzz> rooti1, ok. will check
[06:41] <dan_> :)
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> sorry.
[06:41] <grant> hey epsilon, tried that
[06:41] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: i think tat they can be extended. and why does it matter? you can only have a limited number of pri. partitions? i dunno :(
[06:41] <dan_> then what?
[06:41] <grant> says x is still running
[06:41] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre,  I know how ot write a script, I don't know how to make it cycle through a portion of a string.
[06:41] <vivabenfica> epsilon: yes, 4 primary max
[06:41] <fishsticks> dan_, i have a folder in my home dir for the untarred programs
[06:41] <grant> really want to just kill the x process, any ideas?
[06:42] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker you need to be more fluent in shell language.
[06:42] <dan_> ok, so i should just make one and then unzip them there?
[06:42] <rooti1> Buzzzz: type "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" into the terminal, what do you get ?
[06:42] <Buzzzz> rooti1, it hasn't loaded it
[06:42] <epsilon_> grant init 3 must work afaik :(
[06:42] <fishsticks> dan_, yeah, thats easiest
[06:42] <sobersabre> learn how to use for x in list; do bla1; bla2; done
[06:42] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, apparently :-)
[06:42] <vivabenfica> anyone, can linux boot partitions be logical partitions within an extended partition?
[06:42] <dan_> ok, i just made one
[06:42] <Buzzzz> rooti1, then I get an error that kernel module is not loaded
[06:42] <grant> thinking i maybe typed init 1, let me try again
[06:42] <cryptonic> can someone help me with the mount section right after you partition the drive, the mount for the primary and swap are already filled in, how do i mount the secondry parition?
[06:42] <rooti1> yeah i got the same error
[06:42] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, do you have a tutorial on it?
=== h4x3d is now known as T-R-X
[06:42] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: then make pri: window$, ubuntu, suse
[06:42] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker this means you need to complete a tutorial on bash somewhere in the www.
[06:42] <sobersabre> there are plenty of them.
[06:42] <epsilon_> ext: 1 swap and 1 home
[06:42] <fishsticks> dan_ and then there should be a readme that spells out what you need to do, but it usualyl something like "make && make install", but they often vary
[06:42] <rooti1> that sucks!
[06:42] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker google it up man.
[06:43] <sobersabre> what is wrong with google ?
[06:43] <grant> still says x is running
[06:43] <dan_> ok,  fishsticks.
[06:43] <tony_> i downloaded netloony.. is a jar how can i install this program .. ? im new to linux
[06:43] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker by the way, if you can understand what "man bash" explains, it is very helpful
[06:43] <fishsticks> dan_, what are you trying to compile, i'll have a look too
[06:43] <dan_> i'm going to try to install something. i've used linux for a long time but always used binaries
[06:43] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: it can mount them.
[06:43] <epsilon_> log. partittions start at numer 5 (/dev/hda5)
[06:43] <vivabenfica> epsilon - you're forgetting the 300MB mystery partition
[06:43] <epsilon_> grant: the nvidia driver?
[06:43] <grant> epsilon, trying to run an nvidia driver install
[06:43] <grant> yeah
[06:43] <tuxtheslacker> sobersabre, thanks!
[06:43] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker after you know how to iterate, read on how stdout is handled in cron jobs.
[06:43] <grant> any suggestions?
[06:44] <fishsticks> dan_, what program are you compiling
[06:44] <TomaszD> does anyone know why my firefox is underlining every second word I write despite the fact that they are correct?
[06:44] <sugoruyo> can someone help me with nvidia driver installation issues
[06:44] <vivabenfica> epsilon: it can mount them?
[06:44] <fishsticks> sugoruyo, whats up
[06:44] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: i told you that you can delete that that has nothing to do with windows (ask your vendor)
[06:44] <epsilon_> and please say "epsilon_"
[06:44] <sobersabre> tuxtheslacker and, I suggest you to use crontab in /etc/crontab, instead of /var/spool/cron/$USER
[06:44] <luckyone> can anyone help me get vnc working on ubuntu?
[06:44] <dan_> i'm going to find one, fishsticks
[06:44] <sugoruyo> i can't get it to work
[06:44] <fishsticks> dan_, oh, haha
[06:44] <sobersabre> because it allows root to run scripts with another UID.
[06:44] <savvas> grant: hit CTRL+ALT+F1, login and type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[06:44] <epsilon_> grant: sudo rm /tmp/.X0-lock ;)
[06:44] <dan_> it was a general question, but you're right that i should just try it
[06:44] <fishsticks> dan_ i thought you had one already =P
[06:44] <dan_> hehe
[06:45] <dan_> no, but whenever i go to install one, it doesn't work
[06:45] <sugoruyo> i can't run the config utility etc
[06:45] <Buzzzz> sugoruyo, same here :)
[06:45] <nastas> cryptonic: how are you? everything ok with the partition?
[06:45] <savvas> grant: to make it run again type /etc/init.d/gdm start
[06:45] <grant> thanks guys i'll try that
[06:45] <fishsticks> buzzz and sugoruyo, what can't you do
[06:45] <dizzie> Been ages since i've used xchat. What is the slash command for parsing bash output thru xchat? (ie. uptime or whatever)
[06:45] <savvas> grant: sorry, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[06:45] <tony_> i downloaded netloony.. is a jar how can i install this program .. ? im new to linux
[06:45] <webben> TomaszD, you've probably got the wrong spelling dictionary or something
[06:45] <fishsticks> where is it going wrong
[06:45] <dan_> fishsticks, here's one: http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Software/526220/searchmonkey.html
[06:45] <T-R-X> elo, is it normal i have in my mixer onyl a 4channel mode when my soundcard is 6 channel ?
[06:45] <Buzzzz> fishsticks, the restrited kernel module doesn't load
[06:46] <fishsticks> buzzzz... hrmm
[06:46] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - doubt vendor is going to be around on a sat am to check, but i'm not inclined to kill it without knowing what it is
[06:46] <sugoruyo> i apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel common

[06:46] <sobersabre> it has a variable that I get error with:
[06:46] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - thanks, going to do some more research before i proceed.
[06:46] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: then you will have to wait. what file system is it? does windows see it?
[06:46] <epsilon_> it is not backup, maybe some sort of OEM install source, but that should be fat or ntfs.
[06:47] <sobersabre> configuration error - unknown item 'FAIL_DELAY' (notify administrator)
[06:47] <tony_> i give up . .hehe.
[06:47] <sobersabre> I maybe am missing a pam module or something... has anybody seen this ?
[06:47] <fishsticks> you and buzzzz have the same problem, and i don't know off the top of my head =/ did you try the forums
[06:47] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - linux sees it as unknown, can't remember what windows sees it as
[06:47] <savvas> tony_: jar is a java file, so you need java to run it if it's a java program
[06:48] <Buzzzz> fishsponge_, yeah.. btw what is the name of the restrited module?
[06:48] <tony_> thanks..
[06:48] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - would have to reboot to check (i'm on ubuntu live/install cd now)
[06:48] <sugoruyo> i did but stuff seems to be useless for the most part
[06:48] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: try it. anyway, it is unknown, linux knows lotsof partition tpyes. (fat, ntfs, iso....)
[06:48] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - cool, back in a bit
[06:48] <epsilon_> vivabenfica: i think its just safe to delete it...
[06:48] <epsilon_> okok
[06:49] <fishsticks> hey dan_, i read the readme on that searchmonkey program, its very straightforward

[07:15] <ProN00b> damn, with flash9 my sound gets stuck from time to time, anyone having the same problem ?
=== bung_ is now known as bungley
[07:15] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ you are hungarian?

[07:15] <androide79> ciao a tutti
[07:15] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ know who is Feher the football player who died?
[07:15] <klm-> my acer 3620 laptop (and more precisely its hard drive) starts to make some 'screeking' noise when I turn off the display light (Fn + F4). The sound is quite subtle but hearable from a few meters away. Any ideas why this could be and how to stop it?
[07:16] <epsilon_> vivabenfica i dont watch football but i heard of that accident
[07:16] <epsilon_> vivabenfica he had some heart problem :)
[07:16] <androide79> qualche una parla l'italiano????????
[07:16] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ he was playing for my team, Benfica
[07:16] <epsilon_> androide89 try an italian ubuntu channel
[07:17] <epsilon_> vivabenfica really? :S :S
[07:17] <epsilon_> a foreign team? :) so its your fav
[07:17] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ i said before your recommendation made a total of 5 primary partitions
[07:17] <epsilon_> vivabenfica you can backup that ghost thing
[07:17] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ my wife is Portuguese, and I lived there for 4 years
[07:17] <epsilon_> BUT swap can be logical too! and the home partition
[07:18] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - ghost thing is hidden even from linux
=== lux_ is now known as lux`
[07:18] <epsilon_> vivabenfica ok :)
[07:18] <epsilon_> so: primary: windows, ghost thing, linux, linux
[07:18] <epsilon_> extended-logical: home (20 gb for docs&prefs), swap (2gb)
[07:18] <epsilon_> is it OK? it must be.
[07:19] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - ghost (1), winxp (2), linux boot 1 (3), linux boot 2 (4). where is space for another partition? :)
[07:19] <inc|freaky> hi all. i have a problem upgrading to edgy. i cant completely upgrade some courier packages make problems: http://www.nopaste.linux-beginner.org/?179 can someone help me?
[07:19] <witless> or just install linux, download the free vmware, and install your other OS's in VM's
[07:20] <epsilon_> vivabenfica every linux installer has a partitioner you can add,delete or resize partitions with them (with suse afaik you cant resize)
[07:20] <T-R-X> any1 here that solved cmedia sound cards and 5.1 sound ? ( working bass and center, not only the 4channel mode -> in alsa is only 4 chanel switch ) ?
[07:20] <savvas> inc|freaky: do this first: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f
[07:20] <inc|freaky> i did that.
[07:20] <vivabenfica> epsilon_  - i am aware of that, it is the limitation of 4 primary partitions that is my problem
[07:21] <Tarandus> Does anyone know if a Savage driver with the Freedesktop bug 6357 fixed will soon come to Edgy?
[07:21] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - i've some experience back to RH8 days :)
[07:21] <vivabenfica> witless - not big on vm
[07:21] <epsilon_> vivabenfica 4 primary and you can't make another extended?
[07:21] <epsilon_> !search linux boot
[07:21] <savvas> inc|freaky: oh sorry, this: sudo apt-get install --reinstall courier-authdaemon
[07:21] <ubotu> Found: kernel,google,ubotu,grub,firewall,boot,laptop,mol,alsa-source,ntfs-3g
[07:21] <grant> hey guys please help got a bit of a problem here, installed the nvidia beta drivers and now getting the following error at boot "API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has the version 1.0-7184 but this module has version 1.0-9625" please help
[07:21] <inc|freaky> that doesnt work.
[07:21] <epsilon_> !search extended
[07:21] <ubotu> Found:
[07:21] <epsilon_> pff.
[07:21] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ extended is counted as a primary. just a subdivided primary
[07:22] <savvas> grant: try restart your pc
[07:22] <grant> savvas, hi, that is when i restart the pc, have had to go into maintainence etc just to get into x to get into irc
[07:22] <epsilon_> vivabenfica then i'm the stupid one not you.
[07:22] <epsilon_> IMHO linux CAN boot from extended partitions why not?
[07:23] <epsilon_> !boot
[07:23] <ubotu> Boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions  -  To add/remove startup services, you can use the package 'bum', or update-rc.d  -  To add your own startup scripts, use /etc/rc.local  -  See also !grub and !dualboot - Making a boot floppy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy  -  Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto

[07:24] <Kazero> sudo apt-get install kubuntu?
[07:24] <inc|freaky> savvas: do u have any other ideas?
[07:24] <Alzi2_> Hey. Is it possible to install Kubuntu/Xubuntu from the Ubuntu LiveCD? I don't want to download another ISO AGAIN...|
[07:24] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ will try that, thanks.
[07:24] <inc|freaky> kubuntu-desktop is it i think
[07:24] <epsilon_> can linux boot from a logical partition?
[07:25] <Kazero> Sweet, thanks. By the way, whats Xubuntu?
[07:25] <savvas> inc|freaky: when you reinstall it, try the install -f again
[07:25] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ think it must be primary
[07:25] <inc|freaky> savvas: it all doesnt work ive tried both allready
[07:25] <epsilon_> vivabenfica wait hope that some1 answers :)
[07:25] <Lone> kazero: xubuntu is a 'light' version of ubuntu that is lighter on sys reqs
[07:25] <inc|freaky> http://www.nopaste.linux-beginner.org/?180
[07:25] <epsilon_> please: can linux boot from a logical partition? (yes/no)
[07:25] <savvas> grant: better use the stable nvidia-glx package, unless you know what you're doing, i'd suggest to type in terminal this: sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-glx
[07:26] <ifireball> epsilon_: yes.
[07:26] <strappis> ciao a tutti
[07:26] <epsilon_> thx ifireball.
[07:26] <epsilon_> vivabenfica you see? :)
[07:26] <savvas> inc|freaky: you mean you can't reinstall it?
[07:26] <inc|freaky> the error is here: http://www.nopaste.linux-beginner.org/?180 @ savvas
[07:26] <Kazero> Ah. Now im new to linux, whats X-Desktop? Is that what KDE and gnome run on?
[07:26] <vivabenfica> ifireball: epsilon_ was kindly asking on my behalf. you are 100% that ubuntu can boot from a logical partition?
[07:26] <epsilon_> the whole linux boot-home-swap bunch can be logical
[07:27] <epsilon_> "<ifireball>	epsilon_: yes."
[07:27] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - worth a try i suppose
[07:27] <ubuntugrrrrr> oh good gracious.. this thing has been left on all night -.-
[07:27] <Lone> kazero: kde uses the k desktop environment, xubuntu is just a simpler desktop interface so it runs faster
[07:27] <ifireball> vivabenfica: as long as you have a smart enough boot loader on your MBR; e.g. GRUB, otherwise you have no way of telling your PC to boot that partition
[07:27] <epsilon_> vivabenfica so make a home partition and make BOTH linuxes mount it as a home dir.
[07:27] <Lone> kazero: the k desktop environment is a lot more like windows as opposed to GNOME, which is more like mac (imo)

[07:32] <MEPISUser> Hello?
[07:33] <stefan__> hi .. ive just installed edgy kubuntu... problem: i cant install stuff from multiverse like w32codecs although i added entries to sources.list properly. also tried various archives like de and nl ... any idea?
[07:33] <savvas> inc|freaky: first you do dist-upgrade, then switch to edgy
[07:33] <MEPISUser> I'm trying to install a Lexmark X2480 printer. I can't find any drivers... can anyone help me?
[07:33] <georgeb> savvas: hmm.. don't you have to run apt-get update first, to update from repos ?
[07:34] <dcraven> stefan__, sudo apt-get update
[07:34] <inc|freaky> savvas: you do a upgrade to edgy by doing that. and since i tried to upgrade i get that error the kernel cant be booted too but i now use a rescue system from the network
[07:34] <savvas> georgeb: he already did that
[07:34] <inc|freaky> of course i did apt-get update before
[07:34] <epsilon_> stefan__ try to enable them in synaptic menu "software sources" (or what im not english)
[07:34] <stefan__> dcraven: yep.. already tried it, also apt-get clean.. still doesnt work
[07:34] <savvas> it's a weird mess, i don't really know what to suggest :\
[07:35] <savvas> inc|freaky: try downloading the alternate cd and updating from there

[07:35] <dcraven> stefan__, is w32codecs even in the repos?
[07:35] <fiveiron> ok here's a q... lets say I want to have my users home directories be on a separate volume.  what would the best way to do that be?
[07:35] <epsilon_> stefan__, see THAT
[07:36] <stefan__> its not only the w32codecs , also other stuff.. it always says that theres no installation candidate
[07:36] <fiveiron> change the home dir with vipw?
[07:36] <elias_> how can I recover a file which has been deleted on a reiserfs partition?
[07:36] <dcraven> stefan__, do you have another example handy?
[07:37] <Zambezi> I'm trying to umount two harddrives, but they are busy. Is it just to turn off the computer with sudo halt -p? I don't want to do anything stupid.
[07:37] <zlack> how would I go about running a .bin file?
[07:37] <dcraven> zlack, chmod +x myfile, then ./myfile should do it.
[07:37] <epsilon_> zlack, maybe its not runnable
[07:38] <zlack> Zambezi: is there a process/program using the disks ?
[07:38] <zlack> epsilon_: it should be runnable
[07:38] <dcraven> zlack, he's asking whether or not it has executable permissions.
[07:38] <epsilon_> zlack then the above should do or simply: bash stg.bin
[07:38] <zlack> chmodding did the trick - thanks
[07:38] <stefan__> dcraven: .. cant remember what it was.. because i followed instructions on a page.. but ill look it up
[07:39] <Zambezi> zlack, I'm not sure. I moved all the files from the harddrives with sudo cp-r to another hardrive and then I ran sudo rm-r on the folder (I had just one folder) and then now they are both busy.
[07:39] <dcraven> stefan__, if you added the extra repos properly (as you say), and the update worked, then it's possible that the package you are looking for just isn't in the repository.
[07:39] <Zambezi> zlack, The harddrives I moved the files to wasn't busy.
[07:40] <stefan__> dcraven: ok.. im sorry.. i thought w32 was in the repositories.. it isnt..
[07:40] <zlack> Zambezi: do a ps ax and check if there is a possible program that could use those discs
[07:41] <epsilon_> bye-bye
[07:41] <stefan__> dcraven: anyway.. thanks.

[07:44] <MEPISUser> Kazero, synaptic or kpackage?

[07:48] <roryy> dcypherd: assuming you haven't installed anything at all from edgy, you can change your /etc/apt/sources.list to point at 'dapper' instead of 'edgy', run 'apt-get update' and you should be ok

[07:50] <dcypherd> have you installed edgy Tonren?
[07:50] <dcraven> Tonren, if he didn't install any packages as Edgy, then it won't have any affect on his (dcypherd's) system.
[07:50] <dcypherd> bcuz i haven't

[07:55] <CREWMAN_peppe> ok but my ubuntu is italian and all sources starts with http://it..... is the same thing if i put here?
[07:55] <tonyyarusso> Kazero: Different default applications.  Under the hood, QT vs. GTK, not that that really matters on the user end.  Basically, not much

[07:57] <dcraven> CREWMAN_peppe, they are just geographically dispersed servers. In general it's better (faster?) to use the one nearest you.
[07:57] <Kazero> Can I grab files off my linux distro from a Windows machine on the same network?
[07:57] <CREWMAN_peppe> in italy fast servers?? No isn't correct
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> dcraven: In general.  The North America ones are a bit flighty, so I've had more luck with Ireland's - go figure
[07:57] <llvllatrix> CREWMAN_peppe: I believe language is a function of your locate, not your server
[07:57] <CREWMAN_peppe> for your information, italy is the slowest country in the world speaking about internet
[07:57] <tonyyarusso> Kazero: Look into samba for sharing with Windows
[07:57] <CREWMAN_peppe> !sources
[07:57] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and !easysource
[07:58] <Lattyware> In a bash script, how can I only output part of string that matches a regular expression?
[07:58] <dcraven> Well hence the "in general" part I guess :). That's the idea of mirrors.
[07:58] <CREWMAN_peppe> !easysource
[07:58] <ubotu> source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:58] <Kazero> Bah. Im trying to get a screenshot of Linux in VMware, but it keeps saving the shot in linux
[07:58] <mister_roboto> Kazero: different ipc technologies underneath is one diff. see this page. it's interesting: http://www.cbbrowne.com/info/qtcontroversy.html
[07:59] <Arrick_Sleeping> tonyyarusso, morning
[07:59] <trelayne> hi all, just installed Dapper. ANyone know how to enable ssh from remote?
[07:59] <Arrick_Sleeping> long time no see
[07:59] <jrib> trelayne: install openssh-server
[07:59] <tonyyarusso> Kazero: Try different key combos, ie PrtSc, Alt+PrtSc, Ctrl+PrtSc; no guarantees, but might work
[07:59] <trelayne> thanks
[07:59] <Arrick_Sleeping> tonyyarusso, can I pm you?
[07:59] <jrib> !ssh > trelayne
[07:59] <tonyyarusso> Arrick_Sleeping: Yeah, I've been offtopicing too much.
[07:59] <tonyyarusso> Arrick_Sleeping: sure
[07:59] <CREWMAN_peppe> boys i have to go now, thank you a lot and keep going: you're great and ubuntu is a great distro!!!
[07:59] <CREWMAN_peppe> Bye!!
[08:00] <mister_roboto> trelayne: you need to install openssh-server to allow ssh connections
[08:00] <Lattyware> Anyone?
[08:00] <dcraven> Lattyware, look at string "chopping".
[08:00] <Tonisee> Hello!
[08:00] <Spudulike> Hi room, I only have ssh access to machine foo.  What can I do to configure foo so that I can get a VNC session from it.
[08:00] <MasseR> Does anyone know the exact differences in between ubuntu and edgy, network-wise?
[08:01] <Lattyware> ok, thanks
[08:01] <gcleric> What happened to http://ubuntuforums.org/?  It's offline.
[08:01] <llvllatrix> Spudulike: Install a vnc server
[08:01] <CREWMAN_peppe> oh oh a problem with source o matic: it only generates till dapper distro
[08:01] <trelayne> thanks all
[08:01] <MasseR> *between dapper and edgy
[08:01] <CREWMAN_peppe> solution to this??
[08:01] <Tonisee> I just tried to install Ubuntu Edgy using floppy install as described in docs
=== rachael_ is now known as oc
[08:01] <MasseR> I had my broadcom 4400 working properly in dapper, but since moving to edgy it isn't working
[08:01] <T-R-X> any1 here that solved cmedia sound cards and 5.1 sound ? ( working bass and center, not only the 4channel mode -> in alsa is only 4 chanel switch ) ?
[08:01] <MasseR> It used kernel 2.6.15
[08:01] <MasseR> Which had it working
[08:01] <MasseR> But manually compiling 2.6.15 kernel doesn't help
[08:02] <MasseR> It still doesn't work
[08:02] <Rav|strangler> The forums are down.
[08:02] <Rav|strangler> So I had to come here to get my fix
[08:02] <rothgar> is there a way to auto-login to edgy with a system account? (mythtv)  I couldn't select it from the Admin-> login srceen menu
[08:02] <gcleric> yea. I can see that.
[08:02] <gcleric> but why?
[08:02] <Tonisee> but i experienced strange problems: after executing /usr/sbin/debootstrap --arch i386 /target http://mymirror/ubuntu  it downloaded some stuff.. but then install didn't started
[08:03] <CREWMAN_peppe> oh oh a problem with source o matic: it only generates till dapper distro how can i make them good for Edgy Eft??
[08:03] <Rav|strangler> Maybe maintenance
[08:03] <nlindblad> why are the forums down?
[08:03] <nlindblad> "the forums are offline until further notice."
[08:03] <Rav|strangler> Maybe maintenance
[08:03] <jbroome> that sounds more menacing than "down for maintenance"
[08:03] <Tonisee> is anyone here tried to install Ubuntu via "Debian floppys" way?
[08:04] <dcraven> hehe.. Doesn't look like a maintenance message to me.
[08:04] <Rav|strangler> hehe I didnt want to cry wolf.
[08:04] <jbroome> right
[08:04] <charle97> are the forums gone forever?
[08:04] <Rav|strangler> charle97, nahh
[08:04] <dcraven> Probably another crybaby spat.
[08:04] <stefan__> ok.. another problem: i cant connect to icq network with kopete...
[08:04] <gcleric> I've seen the maintenance notice.  It states that it's down for maintenance.  Until until further notice sounds pretty serious
[08:05] <Rav|strangler> maybe a hacker.
[08:05] <Rav|strangler> I mean a noob
[08:05] <charle97> 'until further notice' seems like forever
[08:05] <Rav|strangler> I'm going to #ubuntu-offtopic before we get yelled at.
[08:05] <Arrick_Sleeping> Anyone here ever setup their own pastebot?
[08:05] <tonyyarusso> Hey guys, it's not a support question so let's take the wondering about the forums to -offtopic
[08:05] <Rav|strangler> !offtopic
[08:05] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[08:06] <maccam94> i want a machine to run a command one time when it starts up, and then never ever again. how do i do this?
[08:06] <Lone> put it in the boot
[08:06] <maccam94> anybody?
[08:06] <eyequeue> the other thing, the message lacks proper capitalization, also making it look less official
[08:07] <Rav|strangler> maccam94,  when the forums come back up try posting there
[08:07] <Rav|strangler> community is pretty quick with replies
[08:07] <Tonisee> Is anyone here successfully installed Ubuntu Edgy (or Dapper) via "Debian floppys" way?
[08:08] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, this is kind of time sensitive lol... i want to get this machine set to do that today so it can go back to the client
[08:08] <maccam94> i want it to reconfigure xserver-xorg one time at boot so it'll work on the client's monitor
[08:08] <CREWMAN_peppe> excuse me! I cannot find a way to use source o matic with Edgy Eft, it only creates Dapper or warty or another. How can i do??? Thanks
[08:08] <coz_> how to enable fastwrites and SBA on edgy nvidia beta>?
[08:08] <francois> hey all, can i install printer drivers for debian on my kubuntu system ?
[08:08] <Rav|strangler> can you change the xserver-xorg
[08:08] <Rav|strangler> and it will load everytime.
[08:08] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, ?
[08:08] <Rav|strangler> I dunno I'm a noob
[08:09] <Rav|strangler> I can try and help you
[08:09] <francois> hey all, can i install printer drivers for debian on my kubuntu system ?
[08:09] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, ah, see Ubuntu autodetects all hardware during the install. I installed Ubuntu on it here at the repair shop, but when it goes back home it needs to be reconfigured to work with the client's monitor. thus i need it to run a command one time at bootup, and then never again
[08:10] <Rav|strangler> ohhh it should recognize her moniter
[08:10] <Nightdrive> CREWMAN: I just installed Automatix2 for edgy. Just googled it and followed instructions
[08:10] <Rav|strangler> I thought we could do that.
[08:10] <jrib> CREWMAN_peppe: create a dapper one and replace all the "dapper" with "edgy"
[08:11] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, no it won't, that is done during the install. It's already been installed, so sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg needs to be run once at bootup
[08:11] <CREWMAN_peppe> very good thank you
[08:11] <rothgar> is there a reason that a system account cannot use the up arrow in a terminal?
[08:11] <hackel_> Anyone familiar with PPTP?  I'm trying to get my connection up, and it comes up the *first* time after I boot, then it disconnects, and after that it won't connect, gets a TCP timeout sending config-requests.  Any ideas?
[08:11] <CREWMAN_peppe> jrib thank you
[08:11] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, last time I checked that is
[08:11] <jrib> CREWMAN_peppe: np
[08:11] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, the last thing i want is an unhappy customer haha
[08:11] <Rav|strangler> try switching monitors and booting it up. I understand that
[08:11] <jrib> rothgar: what do you mean by "system account"?
[08:11] <rothgar> mythtv
[08:12] <hackel_> Anyone familiar with PPTP?  I'm trying to get my connection up, and it comes up the *first* time after I boot, then it disconnects, and after that it won't connect, gets a TCP timeout sending config-requests.  Any ideas?
[08:12] <clandestino> Hi everyone. I can't get a keyboard to work with my laptop. It's a ps/2 keyboard, connected via an ps/2->usb adapter to a usb-port on a thinkpad r52. Since it doesn't work automatically, I guess I have to edit something in xorg.conf, but I don't know where to find good information about this..
[08:12] <Rav|strangler> maccam94, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=219059 that should help you once the forums are back up
[08:12] <Rav|strangler> copy and bookmark it
[08:12] <rothgar> I am using the mythtv account (which doesn't show up as a normal account) and when I am usng a terminal I cannot push UP to show the last command
[08:12] <Lattyware> how can I pipe to a variable? sed [regexp]  | echo ???
[08:12] <Rav|strangler> I dont know off hand.
[08:12] <Rav|strangler> keep askinf here.
[08:13] <Rav|strangler> you want to run a command on boot right.?
[08:13] <tonyyarusso> clandestino: You might be able to get away with just running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and seeing if it autodetects.
[08:13] <maccam94> Rav|strangler, will do
[08:13] <clandestino> tonyyarusso: thanks!
[08:13] <macusr> hello
[08:14] <vivabenfica> hi - how much space does ubuntu boot partition need?
[08:14] <macusr> just upgraded Firefox to version 2
[08:14] <Lattyware> how can I pipe to a variable? sed [regexp]  | echo ???
[08:14] <jbroome> vivabenfica: usually 100mb is fine
[08:14] <macusr> and the icon in the bottom menu shows the regular Firefox icon
[08:14] <tonyyarusso> vivabenfica: Very little.  I have 250 MB, but that's for the possibility of a bunch of kernels and splash images.  100 MB is plenty.
[08:14] <kenny> can i install the "Image for desktop and laptop PCs" on a 64bit processor?
[08:14] <dcraven> vivabenfica, depends how many kernels you want to hold onto. Mine's just under 50mb.
[08:14] <witless> how do i get more columns/rows in console mode?
[08:14] <macusr> everywhere else shows the Ubuntu icon, can I make them all the same?
[08:15] <vivabenfica> thanks all
[08:15] <ATR2001> Hi q all
[08:15] <tonyyarusso> witless: set the vga= option in your kernel line in grub either in /boot/grub/menu.lst or for one time use at boot time.

[08:15] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[08:15] <kenny> hey ... can i install the "Image for desktop and laptop PCs" on a 64bit processor?
[08:16] <tonyyarusso> kenny: I think so, but you won't get the advantage of the processor iirc
[08:16] <witless> tonyyarusso: thanks
[08:16] <macusr> just upgraded to Firefox 2, can I change all the icons to the normal Firefox icon that only shows up in the bottm menu bar?
[08:16] <ATR2001> anyone speak german ?
[08:16] <tonyyarusso> ATR2001: #ubuntu-de
[08:16] <macusr> my dad does
[08:16] <ATR2001> thx tonyyarusso
[08:17] <vivabenfica> would jbroome, tonyyarusso, or dcraven know whether linux boot and swap partitions can be within an extended partition as logical partitions? i have asked that here before, but answers have conflicted with info online, so i'm unsure, and want to partition this new computer right the 1st time
[08:17] <rob2> what happened to the forum?
[08:17] <tonyyarusso> vivabenfica: swap definitely can; boot I'm not sure about
[08:17] <tonyyarusso> rob2: We don't know yet.
[08:17] <rob2> ah ok
[08:17] <jbroome> omg hax
[08:17] <Lattyware> Anyone know how in a bash script I can take the output from a sed command and then only output What matches my regular expression?
[08:18] <ScurveyFrog> yeah, I was also wondering where the forum went!
[08:18] <skiy> Lattyware: join #bash
[08:18] <francois> Does there exist a generic brother printer driver ?
[08:18] <Lattyware> skiy: Ah, right, thanks.
[08:18] <emanuele11> hi everybody! I'm from Italian Ubuntu 's channel and in Italy servers (apt-get  servers) doesn't work. Do American servers work?
[08:18] <skiy> Lattyware: they are always very helpful in there, esp GreyCat :)
[08:18] <vivabenfica> anyone else know if linux can boot from within an extended partition?
[08:18] <Rav|strangler> emanuele11, the servers might be down
[08:18] <tonyyarusso> emanuele11: Doubtful.  The US servers are often "special".  I'd go with another European country.
[08:19] <macusr> just upgraded to Firefox 2, can I make all the icons use the Firefox icon? not Ubuntu
[08:19] <macusr> Ubuntu's icon?
[08:20] <rothgar> I think he means for html files
[08:20] <skiy> vivabenfica: yes it should be able to, there is no reason why not
[08:20] <Rav|strangler> macusr, when the forums come back up do a search for "firefox icon"
[08:20] <skiy> Grub is pretty flexible vivabenfica
[08:20] <Rav|strangler> you should find the how to
[08:20] <Rav|strangler> I havnt gotten around to changing it. it doesnt bother me too much
[08:21] <macusr> how long do you think the forums will be down for?
[08:21] <tonyyarusso> vivabenfica: I also would suspect that it can, I just haven't tried it
[08:21] <tonyyarusso> macusr: No idea.
[08:21] <qc-> does anyone here run xgl with ubuntu?
[08:21] <macusr> =(
[08:21] <Kazero> Ok, I cant figure out for the life of me how to install from a tar.gz file.
[08:21] <rob2> wonder if the servers are run on windows? would explain why they're broken ;)
[08:21] <emanuele11> so, in America they work or no? (I don't know English well)
[08:21] <Kazero> Anyone who can help me?
[08:21] <bola> so this is the great ubuntu channel :D
[08:21] <Rav|strangler> maccam94,  you still around?

[08:22] <jbroome> that's a feature
[08:23] <grigora> hi, set up a couple extra keyboard layout and switch between them using the Alt Keys, however, if I change my windows manager (to fvwm) the Alt keys don't work anymore, anyone knows how to switch layouts in FVWM? thanks
[08:23] <bola> i want to congratulate the guys on the canonical :D
[08:23] <rob2> I managed to corrupt my user profile after I upgraded, spent 2 days wondering what to do then it suddenly came to me in the lavvy & I fixed it in 2 minutes
[08:23] <macusr> I tried to upgrade Ubuntu using Software Update and just got kernel panics on startup =(
[08:23] <tonyyarusso> rob2: What did it need?
[08:23] <Tonren> I've run apt-get dist-upgrade eight times.
[08:24] <rob2> a new profile, it got stuck in a loop trying to mount a windows network share
[08:24] <tonyyarusso> Most problems with Edgy upgrades have been due to improperly configured systems going in and/or improper upgrade procedures.  Make sure before doing any upgrades that you read the instructions for doing so, and have a clean system free of modifications from things like automatix, as they will give you headaches otherwise.
[08:25] <shaninho> has anyone here installed ubuntu on a mac pro?
[08:27] <dcraven> The forums are back online fyi.
[08:27] <georgeb> vivabenfica: you can; the only problem WAS: "When using IDE disks, the boot partition (the partition with the bootable kernel image files) must be completely within the first 1024 cylinders" ; now this problem doesn't exist anymore
[08:27] <Nightdrive> I got a problem with Bluetooth Kb and Mouse. Every boot I have to terminal: sudo hidd --search   I've tried every how to guide to get it run at startup, but no success. Help!

[08:50] <grndslm> Juz_moi, I used samba the other day and didn't need to use xinetd
[08:50] <chantra> would like to try beryl, but xgl and nvidia does not seem to cooperate properly at the moment :s
[08:51] <jinzo> chantra, it works on my box
[08:51] <jinzo> installed it from the tuturial on berly wiki
[08:51] <jinzo> work's like a charm :)
[08:51] <jinzo> ( it has some bug tho.. )
[08:51] <francois> hey gang, i tried installing a new printer, but it keeps asking authorization but it won't accept my username and password, any help ????
[08:51] <Juz_moi> ok konqueror was already working , but when I whent in the menu (xubuntu( shared folders it insisted on installing those 2  (no one in xubuntu was able to help so I came here
[08:52] <chantra> jinzo: got some weird glitges on mine
[08:52] <jinzo> francois, add your user to the printers "group" ?
[08:52] <grndslm> nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

[08:53] <bene1> hi! my laptop suspends after a few minutes if it's on battery - how can i disable this? (dapper)
[08:53] <Squeee> I'm having a problem with the ati drivers, I'm running 2 monitors with the ATI Big Desktop.  Anytime I run any fullscreen 3d it runs on both monitors, and makes it lag.  Is there any way to make it use one without creating a different screen?
[08:53] <francois> jinzo, where do i do that ?
[08:53] <Juz_moi> it would be something like this:      # default: off
[08:53] <Juz_moi> # description: netbios-ssn
[08:53] <Juz_moi> {
[08:53] <Juz_moi>     disable         = no

[08:54] <Juz_moi> }
[08:54] <grndslm> Juz_moi, you're supposed to use pastebin
[08:54] <Juz_moi> sorry for the flood
[08:54] <Juz_moi> ok how or is that the name of a channel?
[08:54] <jinzo> francois, you can look at system --> preferences --> users and groups
[08:54] <grndslm> could anybody other than Juz_moi see my samba instructions above???
[08:54] <jinzo> if your user is in souch a group
[08:54] <grndslm> pastebin.ca it's a website
[08:54] <eyequeue> !pastebin > Juz_moi
[08:54] <Arrick> yes
[08:54] <jbroome> i just see something that should have gone in a pastebin
[08:54] <knix> Is there an alternative mirror for the non-free packages on freecontrib.org? Perhaps one of the debian repos?
[08:54] <knix> freecontrib.org is terribly slow
[08:55] <Juz_moi> ok sorry let me look at pastebin
[08:55] <moyogo> hi
[08:55] <eyequeue> !seveas > knix
[08:55] <james__> lovely
[08:55] <moyogo> upgrading to edgy really killed my laptop's usplash
[08:55] <moyogo> i can see anything until I get to gdm
=== james__ is now known as James_M
[08:55] <moyogo> i can't* i mean
[08:55] <francois> jinzo, can't seem to find anything named printer in usernames or groups or anything, just fax and scanner
[08:55] <grndslm> does anybody besides Juz_moi see my samba instructions posted above??  just checkin' that they didn't go to the whole channel instead of just him
[08:55] <James_M> has anyone else had new wireless problems since edgy?
[08:55] <moyogo> sometimes it even gets stuck
[08:56] <jinzo> blah was not sure if there is souch a group... ( not in ubuntu atm to check )
[08:56] <moyogo> when i go in recovery mode i can see it's EVMS that gets a bug
[08:56] <eyequeue> <grndslm> nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
[08:56] <moyogo> anybody familiar with those issues?
[08:56] <Squeee> James_M: Only broadcom
[08:56] <knix> eyequeue: thanks
[08:56] <francois> jinzo, argh, this is tricky
[08:56] <Juz_moi> grndslm:  how do u send that to just me .. I don't see it on that page, yet
[08:56] <eyequeue> knix, np
[08:56] <James_M> only broadcom...hmmm
[08:57] <DigitalNinja> Is there a way to prevent a module from loading?
[08:57] <James_M> so most atheros stuff works, yeah?
[08:57] <Squeee> James_M Mine does
[08:57] <iter> !find automake1.9
[08:57] <grndslm> eyequeue, thanks...
[08:57] <ubotu> Found: automake1.9
[08:57] <James_M> squeee, what card do you have?
[08:57] <francois> anyone know how to enable printing authorization for a user in kubuntu ?
[08:57] <Squeee> James_M: Go build the madwifi-ng drivers on your own, they are much more functional
[08:57] <shaninho> I am having trouble building/installing a kernel - can anyone help me or point me to somewhere that can help with this process?
[08:57] <grndslm> Juz_moi, I was trying to msg you, but there were breaks in lines, so it only sent the first one to just you
[08:57] <grndslm> i'll pastebin it
[08:58] <Squeee> james_M: a prism chipset, a broadcom, and an atheros_abg
[08:58] <James_M> squee, this card has worked in every release since breezy with whatever was built into the OS
[08:58] <eyequeue> !kernel > shaninho
[08:58] <[gen2] niki> is there a list of well filled repositorys other than the official ones?
[08:58] <francois> anyone know how to enable printing authorization for a user in kubuntu ?
[08:59] <eegore> is there a pppoe client in dapper?
[08:59] <Squeee> James_M: Really, go try the madwifi drivers, their fairly simple to build and they add alot of functionality to the card
[09:00] <eyequeue> francois, try #kubuntu
[09:00] <shaninho> thanks eyequeue - i'm specifically trying to find out how to install 2.6.19-rc4
[09:00] <James_M> squeee, i don't know how to built anything
[09:00] <James_M> build*
[09:00] <Squeee> You can connect to an access point while you scan, you can even create an access point (not adhoc, an actual access point)
[09:00] <Squeee> James_M: Ask around here
[09:01] <der0b> squeee: have you created an access point before?
[09:01] <Squeee> der0b: are you trying to do it?
[09:01] <James_M> squeee, is there a repo i can use to get it?
[09:01] <der0b> squeee: just wondering about it.  if the signal is comparable to a starndard wireless router I would love to SMASH my netgear
[09:02] <Squeee> James_M, Nope, must be compiled for your kernel
[09:02] <Squeee> Der0b: http://madwifi.org/wiki/ngFeatures, have at testing it
[09:02] <der0b> Thanks :)
[09:02] <lalox> buenas...
[09:02] <Squeee> no problem :D
[09:02] <lalox> hi.. anybody from venezuela??
[09:03] <Kream> is it safe to delete /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
[09:03] <karl> in dapper, my 1gig flash card was treated as a "camera" and ran the command specified on the "import digital photographs when connected" specified in preferences.
[09:03] <Kream> ?
[09:03] <bene1> hi! my laptop suspends after a few minutes if it's on battery - how can i disable this? (dapper)
[09:03] <karl> in edgy, it' sbeing treated as removable storage, anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
[09:03] <jerp> I love this stuff man!!
[09:03] <saxin> jerp: what?
[09:04] <James_M> squeee, do I get the code via subversion?
[09:04] <jerp> saxin,  I'm just having a moment of gratefulness
[09:04] <James_M> or by HTTP?
[09:04] <Squeee> James_M: http if possible, svn is going to be experimental
[09:04] <saxin> jerp: great :-)
[09:05] <Squeee> james_M: http://madwifi.org/wiki/Releases/0.9.2
[09:05] <attah> ok.. i've got a annoying problem.. a shellscrip installer gives me "..serup.sh: 9: function: not found x86" generic kernel problem?
[09:05] <schmirgo> does anyone know where i can find the default options of the kernel in ubuntu?(edgy)

[09:06] <pete> Had a quick look through the FAQ, and couldn't find it: Roughly how long does the Dapper-Edgy upgrade take on a 2.2mbps connection, 1.3GHz 256MB RAM?
[09:07] <schmirgo> eyequeue, thanks ;)
[09:07] <godmachine81> anybody in here using azureus in edgy?
[09:08] <jerp> pete, find a server that is close to your location, that will improve speed
[09:08] <godmachine81> just wondering if the window icon isnt working for anyone else.. the icon that goes in your systray and on the window handle
[09:08] <grahamldlw> can someone tell me how to open a file in the terminal, say a pascal code file, so i can run it on the terminal?
[09:08] <iter> pete: 30 mins to upgrade, then anywhere from 0-10 hours of troubleshooting
[09:08] <pete> jerp: Yeah, I know that, I just want to know roughly how long it'll take to know if I should leave my machine on overnight or not.
[09:08] <attah> any ideas on why a shellscript installer gives me "..serup.sh: 9: function: not found x86" generic kernel problem?
[09:08] <pete> iter: heh. I'll take your word for it and hope for the best, then =P
[09:09] <schmirgo> grahamldlw, try nano <filename> ... without brackets ;)
[09:09] <jerp> pete, most servers are using their ftp so it's going to be slow by default  with me- olemiss U to GA took about 30 min
[09:09] <pete> Alright. Thanks.
[09:09] <karl> how come launchpad only has 19 bugs reported for edgy?
[09:10] <jerp> I have a t1 cable amd64 system
[09:10] <grahamldlw> it brought up some nano thing but what does that do and how do i use it?
[09:10] <eyequeue> nano (1)             - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone
[09:10] <iter> pete: you might also consider grabbing the edgy iso and installing fresh from it
[09:10] <iter> many fewer issues reported that way
[09:10] <schmirgo> grahamldlw, that will start a text editor. its like the gedit or kate
[09:10] <pete> Hm.
[09:10] <grahamldlw> but isnt there a way to just run it through the terminal
[09:11] <grahamldlw> i've seen it done b4 but cant remember how
[09:11] <epsilon_> /me is here and ready to help you.
[09:11] <pete> iter: I'm lazy. Totally reinstalling Ubuntu requires too much effort =P
[09:11] <iter> grahamldlw: chmod +x filename && ./filename
[09:11] <grahamldlw> huh???
[09:11] <karl> is launchpad really the way to report bugs against ubuntu?
[09:11] <iter> pete: assuming there is zero troubleshooting you're right
[09:11] <jbroome> yes
[09:11] <eyequeue> !bugs
[09:11] <ubotu> If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug report at: http://bugs.ubuntu.com/  -  Bugs in/wishes for the bots can be filed at http://launchpad.net/products/ubuntu-bots
=== james__ is now known as james_M
[09:11] <karl> it says "all bugs ever reported" is 271, seems horribly light on info, and has bugs with ids in the 60k plus id
[09:12] <iter> grahamldlw: what do you mean by "run it on the terminal"
[09:12] <iter> execute the file like a .exe?
[09:12] <Kream> is it safe to delete /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin ?
[09:12] <iter> or edit the file like notepad
[09:12] <grahamldlw> so it tells me if it's working or not, compile it
[09:12] <sethk> grahamldlw, you seem to be confused.  a file such as you mentioned is a source code file for a programming language.  You can change it with an editor, and of course you can compile it, and then run it.
[09:13] <sethk> grahamldlw, you may be thinking of an IDE, which is a program that wraps an editor, and compiler, and such into an easy to use interface
[09:13] <grahamldlw> yes i want to know how to compile and run it on the terminal
[09:13] <iter> you want to compile with pascal ?
[09:13] <grahamldlw> i know that it's source code
[09:13] <attah> anyone got any ideas on why a shellscript installer gives me "..serup.sh: 9: function: not found x86" generic kernel problem?
[09:13] <sethk> grahamldlw, you can use, say, emacs, or vim, both of which allow you to compile from within the editor
[09:13] <iter> compile with what
[09:13] <grahamldlw> it was done on the terminal i know that for a fact
[09:13] <TRX> any1 got experience with 6channel sound ? (bass and center mainly)
[09:13] <eyequeue> grahamldlw, have you installed some pascal compiler?
[09:13] <james_M> squeee, I have the madwifi-0.9.2, but when I cd to the directory and use make, it tells me my kernel is wrong
[09:13] <grahamldlw> yes
[09:13] <sethk> grahamldlw, it's the "it" that is in question here, not whether it can be done from a terminal
[09:13] <grahamldlw> right...
[09:14] <sethk> grahamldlw, as I said, both vim and emacs allow you to edit, compile, and run, from a terminal session
[09:14] <eyequeue> grahamldlw, the source code is input to that compiler then
[09:14] <iter> yeah it's a bit difficult to understand what you're trying to do
[09:14] <sethk> grahamldlw, those are the ones that come to mind in this environment
[09:14] <Kream> is it safe to delete /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin ?
[09:14] <Squeee> james_m: Type sudo apt-get install module-assistant.  after that is done type "sudo m-a prepare,update"
[09:14] <grahamldlw> my source code that i have for pascal, can be put on to the terminal, compiled and then run, i've had it shown to me before
[09:14] <sethk> grahamldlw, most IDEs are GUI only; vim and emacs are the only ones I can think of, at the moment, that do what you are saying from a terminal
[09:14] <eyequeue> grahamldlw, the documentation for your compiler should explain how
[09:15] <sethk> grahamldlw, you can run the compiler from the command line, sure, and then run the compiled program.
[09:15] <grahamldlw> this has made a relatively easy thing extreamly complicated
[09:15] <sethk> grahamldlw, is that what you mean?
[09:15] <james_M> couldn
[09:15] <iter> ok this is now way offtopic
[09:15] <sethk> grahamldlw, what's compilcated?  I told you, emacs and vim can both do what you are asking.
[09:15] <james_M> squeee, couldn't find package
[09:15] <grahamldlw> ok i dont rele use linux it's purely by chance im stuck with this now so i barely know any commands for the termianal as it is
[09:15] <grahamldlw> terminal*
[09:15] <sethk> james_M, package exists, check your list of repositories.
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, so?  you can't manage to type:    emacs filename?
[09:16] <grahamldlw> and it was a built in compiler, not a seperate program that i downloaded
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, or,   vim filename?
[09:16] <grahamldlw> nope
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, no such thing
[09:16] <james_M> sethk, what am I looking for?
[09:16] <grahamldlw> wanna bet?
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, nothing is "built in".  some things are installed by default.
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, indeed, I do.
[09:16] <SmoothOp> when will flash be up to date with linux?
[09:16] <karl> gpc *.pas && ./something ?
[09:16] <sethk> grahamldlw, since I know and you don't.
[09:16] <eyequeue> grahamldlw, there is no "built-in" pascal compiler
[09:16] <karl> that will compile and run from the commandline.
[09:16] <loufoque> I just had a strange problem, it seems nautilus or gnome-panel crashed and the icons I had in my system tray don't appear anymore. Yet they're still running.
[09:16] <Squeee> james_M: go to ubuntuguide.org, and get your repository list from there
[09:17] <vivabenfica> hi all - which ubuntu cd would i use to manually partition /, /boot, /home, /usr, /var, and /tmp separately. i am using ubuntu 6.06-1 (live/install cd) as we speak, and it does not allow for all of these as separate partitions
[09:17] <sethk> james_M, the packages for madwifi, I think you were asking about?
[09:17] <grahamldlw> as i had it told to me by a fellow linux user that is alot more expierenced then myself and also wrote some stuff for the linux CD
[09:17] <grahamldlw> to be precise the edubuntu CD
[09:17] <iter> grahamldlw: have a cookie, troll
[09:17] <karl> _the_ linux cd.
[09:17] <karl> he must have been pretty cool.
[09:17] <sethk> grahamldlw, well, since you obviously know people who are so much smarter than we are, why don't you go talk to one of them?
[09:17] <jerp> does anybody have a website for setting up a spiffy standalone?
[09:18] <grahamldlw> i never said people, i said person, singular not plural, and because he isnt online
[09:18] <loufoque> anyone has any idea how I could get those icons back, or at least get the main window of those apps?
[09:18] <iter> jerp: check howtoforge for "the perfect setup"
[09:18] <sethk> grahamldlw, well, since we are all so inadequate, I guess you'll have to wait until he's on line.
[09:18] <jerp> iter: ok
[09:18] <grahamldlw> and thats an assumptionm u've made, not something i've said
[09:18] <vivabenfica> sethk - lol
[09:18] <sethk> vivabenfica, use the oem install on the alternate cd
[09:18] <james_M> squeee, what repos do i grab? from ubuntuguide.org
[09:19] <iter> grahamldlw: you would have got a much better response by asking a better question
[09:19] <vivabenfica> sethk - oem install is an option i assume from the menu?
[09:19] <grahamldlw> my question was fine
[09:19] <grahamldlw> and was over complicated by witless remarks such as sethk's
[09:19] <iter> something liek "i have a pascal file, how do I compoile and run it'
[09:19] <sethk> vivabenfica, yes

[09:20] <slacktyro> hi all
[09:20] <jerp> question: how do you lift/save a clip of test on the screen in XChat?
[09:20] <sethk> Amaranth, he's gone, never mind  :)
[09:21] <vivabenfica> epsilon_ - had a nice lunch of salad and home made pizza
[09:21] <slacktyro> what do you use to play mp3,wmv, and etc?
[09:21] <epsilon_> vivabenfica ok :D:D i had a good BF2 session ;)
[09:21] <eyequeue> !restrictedformats > slacktyro
[09:21] <vivabenfica> and now thinking about the size of partitions
[09:21] <sethk> Amaranth, just a troll, but he bailed
[09:21] <vivabenfica> what is BF2?
[09:21] <j3g> hello folks.... strange thing... everytime I boot my interface order is changed... eth1 becomes eth2 and vice versa... etc.... how can i have this set PERM?
[09:21] <Amaranth> sethk: Alright
[09:21] <epsilon_> slacktyro rythmbox is simple and comfortable, amarok is cool and knows everything.
[09:22] <vivabenfica> thanks sethk
[09:22] <Solidad> i have a little question for yo guys, i dont know witch linux-image to install whit my turion64 x2.i installed a 32 it version, because i was told there was some package availability problem whit the 64 versions.but now i dont witch linux-image wold be the best...  linux-k7-smp or linux-686-smp?any sugestion / experience ?
[09:22] <sethk> vivabenfica, np
[09:22] <vivabenfica> back soon
[09:22] <epsilon_> vivabenfica ok, for a linux boot partition, 10-15 G is enough
[09:22] <sethk> Solidad, it really doesn't matter.
[09:22] <djmccormick> my SATA raid shows as two independent drives in the installer... i know it's an adaptec controller. what can i do?

[09:23] <iter> djmccormick: can you boot into your card's bios to setup an array ?
[09:23] <sethk> djmccormick, it probably isn't really RAID.  they label some controllers as "RAID" because they supply a micky mouse software raid emulator for windows.
[09:23] <epsilon_> slacktyro in the wiki look for the quick way its one command

[09:24] <godmachine81> Kream:: was you having segaults with apt-get too?
[09:24] <djmccormick> iter: yes. this is an ibm x306m right out of the box.
[09:24] <Kream> no :) all i want to do is save space
[09:24] <godmachine81> Kream:: btw it is 100% safe to delete those files
[09:24] <patrick_king> anyone know of  an app like dreamweaver mx for linux
[09:24] <iter> and you get /dev/sda and /dev/sdb ?
[09:25] <djmccormick> iter: yep.
[09:25] <iter> (or something similar)
[09:25] <iter> wow
[09:25] <godmachine81> Kream:: they get recreated everytime you do a apt-get update
[09:25] <Kream> am building  a stripped down livecd and after a few chroots in and pkg installs and removes
[09:25] <Kream> they got pretty big
[09:25] <Kream> so :)
[09:25] <quattromaggio> exit
[09:25] <eyequeue> patrick_king, try telling us what you want it to do
[09:25] <djmccormick> iter: i will check one more time to make sure it's still setup correctly for raid1.
[09:25] <Kream> are there any other files it's safe to remove, godmachine81 ?
[09:25] <nolimitsoya> how do i split a tar file in two equal size bits?
[09:26] <knix> is there a restricted modules package for edgy like there was in dapper?
[09:26] <iter> djmccormick: yeah best to double check that one
[09:26] <Kream> nolimitsoya: use bash to read the file size into a variable, divide the variable by two, use cut
[09:26] <patrick_king> eyequeue: to easly create my php webpages link to mysql databases and be able to upload to webserver all in one
[09:26] <godmachine81> Kream:: look in /var/apt/cache/archives  and /var/apt/cache/archives/partial
[09:26] <Kream> godmachine81:  done those
[09:26] <Kream> anything else?
[09:26] <nolimitsoya> Kream, could you give me a stepby step? :)
[09:26] <sethk> djmccormick, it's not appearing as RAID one.  Could be a driver issue.  With some RAID devices, if the O/S uses a default generic SATA driver, because it doesn't find a specific driver for the chip set, the RAID functionality will disappear (well, appear to disappear, really)
[09:26] <godmachine81> Kream:: depends on how important documentation is
[09:27] <godmachine81> heh
[09:27] <eyequeue> patrick_king, as in scp?  i don't really get you
[09:27] <gumpish> Sooo, there's no firefox 2 package in ubuntu repositories atm?
[09:27] <Arrick> Anyone here able to help finish the configuration of a pastebot that was written in perl, thats running on Ubuntu breezy?
[09:27] <eyequeue> !info firefox edgy
[09:27] <ubotu> firefox: lightweight web browser based on Mozilla. In component main, is optional. Version 2.0+0dfsg-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 9001 kB, installed size 28588 kB
[09:27] <patrick_king> eyequeue: have you used dreamweaver
[09:27] <nalioth> sethk: did you get your !ops problem sorted?
[09:27] <Kream> godmachine81:  not very
[09:27] <eyequeue> patrick_king, no idea wht it is
[09:27] <gumpish> =/
[09:28] <eyequeue> !info dreamweaver
[09:28] <ubotu> Package dreamweaver does not exist in any distro I know
[09:28] <sethk> nalioth, yes, thanks.  just a troll, who left.
[09:28] <Kream> lol
[09:28] <ubuntu> lo all, i have broken my home directory.. i messed up the permissions and now i cant log in "unable to cd to home directory"
[09:28] <DigitalNinja> anyone using an nvidia pcie card?
[09:28] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja: me
[09:28] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja gf 6600 gt
[09:28] <Mahmoud85> patrick_king : try nvu
[09:28] <gumpish> Is there a special channel for dapper support?
[09:28] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Do you have "agpgart" loaded?
[09:28] <vpol> hi all. is anybody here who uses edgy64 + Nvidia-binary-Beta?
[09:29] <eyequeue> ubuntu, reboot to recovery mode, then chmod /home back again
[09:29] <sethk> ubuntu, try this:   sudo chown -R username /home/username
[09:29] <ubuntu> my home directory is owned by the user and the user is in the correct group. permissions of the /home/username dir i have set to 755
[09:29] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja oooh i dont know :( im not in linux
[09:29] <sethk> ubuntu, of course, substitute the real user name for "username"
[09:29] <godmachine81> Kream:: cd /usr/share/doc && du -h --max-depth=0
[09:29] <bretzel> Hi How do I know or -- how Beryl is supposed to work with AIGLX + Nvidia and how I know I have AIGLX ????????????/
[09:29] <patrick_king> ok will give nvu ago is it like blowish
[09:29] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja why is it so impportant?
[09:29] <godmachine81> Kream:: see how many megs that says your using
[09:29] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: What? Your not in Linux?
[09:29] <karl> ubuntu: might have different uids, try the chown anyway,
[09:29] <ubuntu> eyequeue, sethk yes, i did that.. i am chrooted in the live cd at the momment but i still cannot login as the user
[09:29] <Kream> godmachine81:  I simply use du -m -s
[09:29] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja yes :D
[09:29] <karl> it might look like they're already in the same group, and correct ownersip, but try anyway.
[09:29] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja but i can restart if you want it so
[09:30] <sethk> ubuntu, you did a chown -R on the home directory (not the files in the directory, the directory itself)?
[09:30] <bretzel> ow do I know or -- how Beryl is supposed to work with AIGLX + Nvidia and how I know I have AIGLX ????????????
[09:30] <ubuntu> karl: i did
[09:30] <bretzel> !AIGLX
[09:30] <ubotu> AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
[09:30] <ubuntu> sethk: correct
[09:30] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Yup! I need to know if agpgart is needed to run the nvidia driver. Could you reboot into Linux?
[09:30] <sethk> ubuntu, and what is the message you get, exactly?
[09:30] <eyequeue> ubuntu, btw, you should still be able to login even without a $HOME, you'll just get dumped in /
[09:30] <godmachine81> Kream:: still how much would it free up?
[09:30] <Mahmoud85> patrick_king : do U mean bluefish ?
[09:30] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja ok then. ill be back in a few mins ;)
[09:30] <djmccormick> iter: i checked the raid bios and it's for sure in raid1.
[09:30] <j3g> how can one set the order on which the modules should be loaded?
[09:30] <ubuntu> Unable to cd to '/home/bob
[09:30] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I'll get more coffee
[09:30] <godmachine81> Kream:: documentation is sometimes good to have.. somethings wont display right without it
[09:30] <ubuntu> sethk: Unable to cd to '/home/bob
[09:30] <patrick_king> Mahmoud85: thats the one sorry
[09:31] <eyequeue> ubuntu, but you are logged in, just not in that dir
[09:31] <sethk> ubuntu, I'm assuming that it didn't say   '/home/bob             with just one single quote
[09:31] <Kream> godmachine81:  I know, it's a risky step
[09:31] <iter> djmccormick: http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-50645
[09:31] <ubuntu> sethk: eyequeue as root, in the live cd (i chrooted it
[09:31] <sethk> ubuntu, what happens if, as root, you do   cd /home/bob  ?
[09:31] <ubuntu> sethk: yesh, the quote is closed
[09:31] <Kream> if only kubuntu-desktop didn't depend on such inane and unnecessary stuff like speedcrunch!
[09:31] <avagant> First day on Edgy guys, everything going good so far.
[09:31] <ubuntu> sethk: that works
[09:31] <iter> djmccormick: still looking
[09:31] <sethk> ubuntu, ok, do this:   ls -ld /home/bob
[09:31] <ubuntu> sethk: the permissions are: drwxrwxr-x
[09:31] <avagant> I was very very worried.
[09:31] <patrick_king> Mahmoud85: Yes NVU is the type of thing i was looking for
[09:32] <ifireball> what the hack happened to X's ctrl+alt+"+" in Edgy????
[09:32] <patrick_king> cheers
[09:32] <sethk> ubuntu, owner and group are bob?
[09:32] <ubuntu> sethk: correct
[09:32] <avagant> The forums are down for the count, anybody have good edgy stories instead of the horror ones I keep hearing?
[09:32] <ubuntu> drwxrwxr-x 91 bob bob 8192 2006-11-04 19:26 /home/bob/
[09:32] <sethk> ubuntu.  ok.  as root, create a new directory, then chown -R bob:bob /newdirectory, then see if you can cd to it as bob
[09:32] <eyequeue> avagant, the forums are fine now
[09:33] <avagant> o rry?
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: I cannot log in as bob
[09:33] <sethk> ubuntu, you don't have to, you can, as root, do:     su bob
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: as root in the chrooted env i cannot do su - bob
[09:33] <avagant> I spend too much time there, lol.
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: i cannot
[09:33] <sethk> ubuntu, not su - bob, su bob
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: same message
[09:33] <godmachine81> Kream:: you dont have to use the meta package kubuntu-desktop
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: ah, ok.. forgot that - loads env vars
[09:33] <Kream> I know, I don't
[09:33] <sethk> ubuntu, ok, then, it has nothing to do with the directory.
[09:33] <ubuntu> sethk: yeah, works as su bob
[09:33] <avagant> wait so say my name is skt you can do "su skt"?
[09:33] <epsilon_> digitalninja u still here?
[09:33] <godmachine81> Kream:: you could install kde-base  and whatever you want
[09:34] <Kream> i'm remastering the ubuntu livecd for a couple of labs I administer
[09:34] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Yup!
[09:34] <Coffeegrinds> is anyone else having issues with the new install cd? I keep having X restart 5 minutes in, can't install like that now can i?
[09:34] <sethk> ubuntu, you can su bob, and then you can cd?  to the one you created?  how about to /home/bob?
[09:34] <avagant> Coffeegrind, the cd hasn't worked for me.
[09:34] <Coffeegrinds> Same deal?
[09:34] <ubuntu> sethk: sethk sorry, no even su bob does not work
[09:34] <avagant> I recommend if you already have Dapper to do gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:34] <avagant> It takes a while but you can get edgy.
[09:34] <djmccormick> iter: "We didnt know at the time how HostRAID got its name, but turns out it is really descriptive. They call it HostRAID, because the damn host machine does the RAID, not the card. They are selling SATA controllers that simulate hardware RAID, by moving the software RAID into the driver and out of the OSs control."
[09:35] <ubuntu_> I write (sudo mount -t hpsplus /dev/sda3 ./mac), but (ls Users/user/Pictures) type (Permision denied)
[09:35] <ubuntu> sethk: i get bash: /home/bob//.bashrc: Permission denied
=== ubuntu_ is now known as Z80user
[09:35] <Kream> godmachine81:  therefore, need to have something that can easily be upgraded and am wary of removing kubuntu-desktop
[09:35] <ubuntu> sethk: it has the double // which is odd
[09:35] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Did "agpgart" load?
[09:35] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja in xorg.conf there is no nvagp option
[09:35] <avagant> It took me 3 hours to get Edgy last night.
[09:35] <Z80user> somebody help me, in a private ?
[09:35] <Kream> because who knows, it might actually depend on something new, necessary and important one day
[09:35] <sethk> ubuntu, yes, a bit.  do    ls -l /home/bob/.bashrc
[09:35] <Coffeegrinds> is there any rhyme or reason as to why thats happening that you know of?
[09:35] <godmachine81> Kream:: are you trying to say that your labs already have kubuntu-desktop on the machines?
[09:35] <avagant> And then with 7 minutes left the update manager disappeared and I just dist-upgraded the rest.
[09:35] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: OK, can you tell me if "agpgart" loaded?
[09:36] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja how can i see the modules which i have loaded?
[09:36] <ubuntu> sethk: as bob i cannot, it thinks /home/bob is a file not a dir
[09:36] <Z80user> In ubuntu ... I write (sudo mount -t hpsplus /dev/sda3 ./mac), but (ls Users/user/Pictures) type (Permision denied)
[09:36] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: Do you already have Dapper?
[09:36] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: lsmod | less
[09:36] <Coffeegrinds> yup
[09:36] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja ty
[09:36] <Kream> godmachine81:  they will, when they install the distro on the cd i'm remastering (very painfully and incrementally)
[09:36] <sethk> ubuntu, maybe /home/bob _is_ a file, which would explain the problem.
[09:36] <ubuntu> sethk: as bob i do ls -al /home it does ?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? /home/bob
[09:36] <jochem_> ubuntu, stat /home/bob
[09:36] <avagant> And you want to update to edgy?
[09:36] <ubuntu> sethk: nope, as root i can cd /home/bob/
[09:36] <sethk> ubuntu, as root, can you do    ls -l /home/bob/.bashrc?
[09:36] <avagant> I burned 2 Edgy cd's and neither of them worked for me.
[09:36] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja: "agpgart                34888  2 nvidia,intel_agp"
[09:36] <Linuturk> I've added a particular font to /usr/share/fonts/ and refreshed the font cache, but it isn't showing up in fonts:/// or in any programs. Any suggestions?
[09:36] <sethk> ubuntu, right, you said that, I forgot.  the ls -l of /home/bob/.bashrc?
[09:37] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja so i have it :)
[09:37] <avagant> So I had to netboot to get Dapper and then upgraded to edgy.
[09:37] <godmachine81> Kream:: what you should do is build a base system from scratch and then do dpkg --get-selections >installed.txt
[09:37] <Coffeegrinds> well update or fresh install.. i was going to go fresh (cause i had already botched my sql install on this machine
[09:37] <ubuntu> sethk: -rwxrwxr-x 1 bob bob
[09:37] <godmachine81> Kream:: and use that to build your livecd
[09:37] <james_M> oh, snap
[09:37] <iter> djmccormick: still there? this might pertain to your question:
[09:37] <james_M> oh
[09:37] <avagant> Hmm.
[09:37] <iter> djmccormick: http://www.jimmy.co.at/weblog/?p=64
[09:37] <godmachine81> handpicking things
[09:37] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: So you have an intel chip for onboard video?
[09:37] <godmachine81> and removing files
[09:37] <sethk> ubuntu, how about     cat /home/bob/.bashrc       does it look reasonable?
[09:37] <godmachine81> its going to most likely cause dep issues
[09:37] <james_M> wow, i got my wireless working on my own
[09:37] <Tonren> I think... I think I'm updated to Edgy.
[09:37] <avagant> Well I don't know much about sql.
[09:38] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja no, just intel motherboard chipset. i have GF6600GT
[09:38] <ubuntu> sethk: yeah, it's standard
[09:38] <Coffeegrinds> niether do i thats why  it's botched. but i was using it to run some forums\
[09:38] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I see
[09:38] <avagant> I'd say do the update manager thing, because you are just going to beat your head in trying to get the install disc to work.
[09:38] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: No onboard video?
[09:38] <sethk> ubuntu, maybe the problem is with the user, then.  does the line for bob in /etc/passwd look normal?
[09:38] <avagant> I spent about 2 days trying to get my Edgy cd to work, putting in all those stupid codes and what not.
[09:38] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja dunno :S no, afaik. (asus p5gd1 pro)
[09:38] <sethk> ubuntu, because if you can't su bob (without the dash), something is wrong with bob
[09:38] <Czech> Hi
[09:38] <sethk> ubuntu, the user id, not necessarily the person  :)
[09:38] <avagant> I think my cd drive is foobarred though.
[09:38] <ubuntu> sethk: hmm, the line has a bunch of ,,, in it
[09:38] <Coffeegrinds> well here goes nuthin
[09:39] <atarinox> are there any essential security apps i should have for xubuntu after installing?
[09:39] <sethk> ubuntu, that's odd
[09:39] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I have a MSI NX7600GT that I can't get it working on my EPoX 9GF6100-M
[09:39] <avagant> You doin' the upgrade manager?
[09:39] <sethk> ubuntu, you might try deleting user bob, then recreating him.
[09:39] <Tonren> Aw man.  Tilda doesn't work anymore!
[09:39] <djmccormick> iter: does ubuntu come with a software raid option at all?
[09:39] <avagant> n1gke: Alot of people apparently couldn't.
[09:39] <sethk> ubuntu, useradd   without any flags won't try to create a home directory, so should work
[09:39] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja: what is the error messagE?
=== jinz0 is now known as jinzo
[09:39] <ubuntu> sethk: bob:x:1000:1000:amcg,,,:/home/bob/:/bin/bash
[09:39] <avagant> n1gke: Mine would get to the stage after the bouncing status bar after boot up and then just freeze.
[09:39] <sethk> ubuntu, try userdel bob,  then useradd bob,    then passwd bob     (all as root)
[09:39] <n1gke> avagant, Yeh. I see that here too. I will try later on, perhaps on another box in a couple a' weeks.
[09:40] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I don't see an error message. X locks up. That's the problem.
[09:40] <ubuntu> sethk: by default htat wont rm /home/bob ?
[09:40] <Flannel> lastlog sethk
[09:40] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: those ,'s are normal
[09:40] <sethk> ubuntu, no, it won't
[09:40] <n1gke> avagant, I had quite a number of difficulties.
[09:40] <godmachine81> thats not odd
[09:40] <avagant> n1gke: You could always gksu "update-manager -c"
[09:40] <jochem_> those ,'s occur in my /etc/passwd as well :)
[09:40] <sethk> ubuntu, without -m, it won't even create a home for a new user.
[09:40] <avagant> Which is probably the safest way to do it.
[09:40] <avagant> Outside of a fresh install.
[09:40] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I've posted all over the net. Even in the nvidia forums. It's been two weeks and no fix
[09:40] <ubuntu> godmachine81: there are other users on the system and the lines for them don't have ,,,
[09:40] <Coffeegrinds> avangant : gonna look into it.  - have to laugh at your CD dilemma, the Edgy Disc is the first to complete burning without coaster-zing in the past 3  monhs.
[09:40] <sethk> ubuntu, and userdel never deletes the home directory.  Of course, backing up the home directory first is always a good idea.  use tar
[09:40] <anapivirtua> reboot windauze
[09:41] <n1gke> avagant, I am using two seperate server type machines 'ere and am thinking they have not caught up with them in the software.....
[09:41] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: I hear ya, I hear ya.
[09:41] <iter> djmccormick: yes, use mdadm
[09:41] <godmachine81> ubuntu but bob is your super user right?
[09:41] <Coffeegrinds> it's almost cost as much in media as a new drive
[09:41] <iter> djmccormick: works great
[09:41] <ubuntu> sethk: ok, userdel bob && useradd -G users bob -s /bin/bash ?
[09:41] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja: :( what is the error message? do you think it has something to do with agpgart?
[09:41] <epsilon_> !agpgart
[09:41] <Flannel> Coffeegrinds: the ISOs shouldnt matter in your burning process, you should burn slower (4x) or so, and check the MD5 of your download
[09:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about agpgart - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:41] <n1gke> avagant, Both of these machines have two cpu's each....
[09:41] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: I had a 50 cd case thing, and now because of all of this I have like 10.
[09:41] <sethk> ubuntu, don't use -G, not necessary
[09:41] <n1gke> ava I think that is part of my difficulty.
[09:41] <avagant> n1gke: Well then.
[09:41] <sethk> ubuntu, ok, won't hurt, I guess
[09:41] <dutchy> hey guys, im looking for a better text editor, that has auto-indent and syntax highlighting... can anyone recommend one (not vi)?
[09:41] <sethk> ubuntu, I'
[09:41] <ubuntu> godmachine81: no, bob is a normal user.. root is the superuser
[09:41] <godmachine81> i dont think any of it is necessary his /etc/passwd entry is correct sethk
[09:42] <sethk> godmachine81, I don't believe that it is
[09:42] <avagant> I've tried alot of flavors of linux, and let me tell you.....whew.
[09:42] <iter> dutchy: haha trying to start a war eh
[09:42] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: root is the super user but is bob the user of admin group?
[09:42] <sethk> godmachine81, even if I'm wrong, it won't hurt anything
[09:42] <ubuntu> godmachine81: yes
[09:42] <Flannel> dutchy: most text editors do that, gedit, kate, etc
[09:42] <avagant> dutchy: gedit, kate aren't bad.
[09:42] <iter> dutchy: emacs will do you right if you don't mind learning a lot of obscure commands
[09:42] <dutchy> Flannel: i must have missed the auto-indent in gedit then :|
[09:42] <ubuntu> sethk: I will try, but would like to hear what godmachine81 has to say, if anything, first :)
[09:42] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I was told that the agpgart module might be the problem. However, I can't remove it. I've tried turing it off. I even tried compiling a new kernel with out it. I can't seem to remove it from the kernel.
[09:42] <avagant> I want TextMate.
[09:42] <sethk> ubuntu, ok.
[09:42] <n1gke> avagant, I have many version's on CD and DVD, but I truly am very happy with 6.06 LTS, on any computer I load it to.
[09:42] <avagant> I want it so bad I can taste it.
[09:43] <sethk> ubuntu, if I'm not here, I'll be back after a bit.
[09:43] <delta> Hi. Is it possible to install the nvidia-driver on a livecd of ubuntu edgy?
[09:43] <ubuntu> sethk: thanks!
[09:43] <n1gke> What is TextMate ?
[09:43] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja: see this :S :S http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8776/README/appendix-f.html
[09:43] <ubuntu> sethk: will let you know how it goes
[09:43] <avagant> n1gke: Well, I wouldn't advice people to go to Edgy until things settle down a bit anyways.
[09:43] <avagant> n1gke: A text editor for Mac.
[09:43] <avagant> They need to port it.
[09:43] <n1gke> Really avagant, I agree....
[09:43] <Coffeegrinds> Flannel,  Ive even tried at 1x, gets to 99% then i/o error . look at the disc and not a mark on it, put it back in the drive and it reads as a blank with 4.7 gb free (or 700mb) but theres a hard circle etched into the disk
[09:43] <n1gke> oic
[09:43] <avagant> I guess there's a port coming out for Windows.
[09:44] <avagant> It's beautiful, simply beautiful.
[09:44] <iter> psh text editor from the mac
[09:44] <ubuntu> sethk: you stil there?
[09:44] <avagant> iter: hahaha.
[09:44] <ubuntu> sethk: id did not work
[09:44] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja apart from that... honestly i dont know :(
[09:44] <n1gke> I have here the HP Kayak XU800 server, dual 750 Mhz cpu's with three IDE drives to 120 G
[09:44] <Coffeegrinds> I'm thinking Laser isn't movin ..
[09:44] <godmachine81> Gecos 	 Specifies general information about the user that is not needed by the system, such as an office or phone number. The value is a character string. The Gecos field cannot contain a colon.
[09:44] <sethk> ubuntu, what didn't work?
[09:44] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: thats what those commas are
[09:44] <iter> there are 10^6 text editors from the nix world
[09:44] <Flannel> Coffeegrinds: then you need to take issue with your burner, or software.  The contents of an ISO will not affect it's burning success
[09:44] <godmachine81> that means they dont have that info put in
[09:44] <iter> some of which are actually pretty good!
[09:44] <avagant> n1gke: Can I have one of those hd's? hahaha
[09:44] <ubuntu> sethk: userdel/add
[09:44] <ubuntu> sethk: same problem
[09:44] <n1gke> avagant, The video is my next project to fix, the card has dual video output.....
[09:44] <godmachine81> those commas have nothing to do with whatever your original problem is
[09:44] <ubuntu> sethk: i think the double // has something to do with it..
[09:44] <ubuntu> godmachine81: ok, thanks..
[09:44] <sethk> ubuntu, that doesn't mean it didn't work.  "it didn't work" means you weren't able to add/delete the user
[09:44] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I've tried that but no luck. Maybe I'll give it another try. You have been a big help. I know know that nvidia pcie cards work.
[09:44] <godmachine81> i missed the first part but in /etc/passwd that is normal
[09:45] <avagant> n1gke: Have you tried the forums?
[09:45] <n1gke> avagant, I can send you a 15 g no problem.
[09:45] <ubuntu> sethk: the user was succsesfully deleeted
[09:45] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: whats your original problem?
[09:45] <dutchy> doh :| i missed the gedit indenting because it indents, but not automatically after a { :>
[09:45] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Wasn't sure if they did or not. I'm looking at your motherboard. Maybe I have a board that doesn't work with Linux.
[09:45] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja i think the motherboard is the problem in some way :S
[09:45] <n1gke> avagant, Yeh, with my limited time, I have been in and out trying to learn more and more.
[09:45] <avagant> Dear goodness, I need a new computer or a new hd, or more hd space.
[09:45] <ubuntu> godmachine81: Unable to cd to '/home/variant' when logging in, i am chrooted in the live cd atm
[09:45] <avagant> I have 2 hd's with 10gb's each.
[09:45] <Coffeegrinds> Flannel, Ohh i know, like i said the iso is the first cd to burn in months, works fine in a laptop ive got and md5 checks out fine..
[09:45] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja does it have integrated graphics? then try to remove the GF and install that way
[09:46] <n1gke> avagant, IDE or SCSI please ?
[09:46] <Coffeegrinds> shazzbutty computer though
[09:46] <jaa6c6> for grub to work does my /boot partition need to be a primary partition?
[09:46] <ubuntu> godmachine81: i was messing with the permissions of /home/ when i started
[09:46] <ubuntu> godmachine81: now it's not working
[09:46] <Flannel> jaa6c6: no
[09:46] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: I bought my computer off Craigslist, when I originally got it sound didn't work and the Windows installation was borked.
[09:46] <sethk> ubuntu, oh, you never said that.   do    ls -ld /home
[09:46] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: so your trying to cd to /home/variant on the physical disk?
[09:46] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: It has a built in 6100. That works fine.
[09:46] <avagant> As soon as I went to Ubuntu everything worked fine, but the cd player is on it's last legs.
[09:46] <ubuntu> godmachine81: bob actualy, thats a different user.. but the problem is there too!
[09:46] <avagant> I can't even get it to open.
[09:46] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: It's the fancy NX7600GT that doesn't work.
[09:47] <avagant> Without almost forcing it to.
[09:47] <ubuntu> sethk:
[09:47] <godmachine81> ubuntu::  whats your owner/group of /home ?
[09:47] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja try to turn off the integrated one in the bios
[09:47] <avagant> That's what I get for trying to be cheap.
[09:47] <Coffeegrinds> avagant: beat ya! got mine out of a trash can, celeron 1.4 256mb, and a voodoo 3 PCI to boot!
[09:47] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: also whats the perms
[09:47] <avagant> WHOA
[09:47] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I did that. I still get the same problem
[09:47] <godmachine81> run the command sethk asked you to
[09:47] <n1gke> avagant, I have CD's, HD's and DVD's for you, tell me what you need and how to get one of them to you.
[09:47] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy.
[09:47] <Tonren> Hey guys.  Some panel icons (such as Tomboy's and Glipper's) are not actually transparent, so a "styled" panel looks ugly behind them.  Is there a way to edit them to make them actually transparent?
[09:47] <ubuntu> godmachine81: root root drw-r--r--
[09:47] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I had to do a BIOS update to get that option
[09:47] <avagant> n1gke: I don't have the money otherwise I'd hit you up on that.
[09:47] <djmccormick> iter: mdadm will probably work fine after what i'm reading, but i'm wondering how to actually get it working. would i just install on the first disk then set up mdadm with raid1 using the disk i used to install and the second disk as the mirror and it'll copy all over?
[09:48] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja but did you turn it off? :)
[09:48] <Coffeegrinds> heheh / all hail free software on free hardware
[09:48] <patrick_king> has anyone got counter strike source running on ubuntu edgy
[09:48] <avagant> More then likely I'm going to have to just stick the money into buying a newer computer.
[09:48] <godmachine81> ubuntu:: sudo chmod 755 /home
[09:48] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: Where do you live that you found that? Haha
[09:48] <n1gke> avagant, Dude or dudette, whatever, these are for your taking as I get them for zip. I collect from every source and put them in stock to help others.
[09:48] <ubuntu> godmachine81: sethk: ls -ld /home/
[09:48] <ubuntu> drw-r--r-- 6 root root 4096 2006-11-04 18:58 /home/
[09:48] <jochem_> that explains!
[09:48] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: It's OFF!
[09:48] <iter> djmccormick: I don't know if it's possible to boot from /dev/md0
[09:48] <n1gke> BRB
[09:49] <godmachine81> ubuntu do sudo ls -ld /home/variant
[09:49] <avagant> That would be beautiful to just randomly come upon a computer.
[09:49] <cafuego> iter: it is, raid1 anyway.
[09:49] <sethk> ubuntu, the trailing slash is not necessary, if that's what you were trying to say.  If the trailing slash is necessary, then you probably also have created a file in / named home
[09:49] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja OKOK :D :(
[09:49] <iter> cafuego: awsome, how
[09:49] <sethk> ubuntu, you need x permission on /home
[09:49] <sethk> otherwise it isn't searchable
[09:49] <Coffeegrinds> Ottawa, The Greath canadia theatre company threw it out ofter an old virus (dos era) was brought in, was cheaper to toss it for them and replace than clean... (Hehehe)
[09:49] <sethk> ubuntu, so do:   chmod a+x /home
[09:49] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I've been at it for two weeks. Sorry!
[09:49] <cafuego> iter: During install, create a raid1 device and mount it as / :-)
[09:49] <Coffeegrinds> can\t spell canadian..
[09:50] <ubuntu> sethk: i dont know what you mean, /home/ and /home are the same thing (directory)
[09:50] <n1gke> Had to crank the volume as they are now playiing my favorite song of all time, "Blondie, Rapture". At 110 watts sourround sound it sounds awesome. . .
[09:50] <godmachine81> sethk:: i told him to sudo chmod 755 /home
[09:50] <avagant> I wanna live in Canada anyways.
[09:50] <bobmcbob> hi, just installed edgey, uncommented the extra sources in the sources.list file and now apt-get update fails with the error : W: GPG error: http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com edgy Release: Unknown error executing gpgv
[09:50] <djmccormick> you can create these raid devices during install? where is that done?
[09:50] <ubuntu> /home/variant is a dude that was helpin me the other day
[09:50] <jaa6c6> flannel: thank you very much your answer helped me alot
[09:50] <sethk> ubuntu, ok, good.  I was wondering why you said  "it is ls -ld /home/"   as if ls -ld /home were wrong
[09:50] <iter> cafuego: haha ok
[09:50] <ubuntu> sethk: tab completion
[09:50] <jaa6c6> flannel: i finally got my raid5 to boot
[09:50] <sethk> godmachine81, I don't recommend using numbers with chmod for new users.
[09:50] <avagant> I think I'm gonna move to Canada. Free computers? HECK YA
[09:50] <sethk> godmachine81, did you do:   chmod a+x /home ?
[09:50] <n1gke> avagant, So, would a 15 or 20 gig help some ? These are IDE drives, but I also have SCSI in various forms.
[09:51] <godmachine81> me?
[09:51] <tonyyarusso> Where did the "New login in nested window" option from Dapper go?  I want to do that.
[09:51] <avagant> I don't know the difference, n1gke.
[09:51] <avagant> All I know is I have 2 10gb hd's.
[09:51] <sethk> godmachine81, sorry
[09:51] <cafuego> iter: it's the easiest way; otherwise you need to sue mdadm to create the raid set, the mount it, install the system in a chroot, fix up the bootloader and cross your fingers.
[09:51] <ubuntu> sethk: it's ok, i understand octal notation :)
[09:51] <avagant> Do you live in Qualhog?
[09:51] <avagant> Haha
[09:51] <n1gke> lololol
[09:51] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja i'm sure its the motherboard, if nvidia says your card is supported (if it says so - the 8776 supports it)
[09:51] <n1gke> No but I do enjoy eating those !
[09:51] <n1gke> lol
[09:51] <avagant> Hahaha.
[09:51] <n1gke> lol
[09:51] <sethk> ubuntu, that's not the point, it's error prone.  regardless, since nobody seems to be able to understand why using octal is dumb, did you do it?   chmod a+x /home   (or, if you insist, whatever octal number that corresponds to)?
[09:52] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Well, time for me to find more coffee. I'm getting another system so I'll try the NX7600GT in that one. I just need to find out what board I need to get.
[09:52] <n1gke> Where you are ?
[09:52] <avagant> I think that's where the show is based.
[09:52] <avagant> I haven't watched in a while.
[09:52] <iter> cafuego: or use a third drive temporarily
[09:52] <godmachine81> sethk:: it would be 755 ;)
[09:52] <avagant> I'm in cali right now man, looking to make my big trip back to the east.
[09:52] <ubuntu> sethk: godmachine81: chmod 755 or a+x worked 1!!
[09:52] <n1gke> Cool !
[09:52] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja okay. and does it work with oher linuxes? for example suse's hardware support is very good
[09:52] <cafuego> iter: how do you mean?
[09:52] <avagant> But first I need el jobbo.
[09:52] <sethk> ubuntu, good.
[09:52] <godmachine81> heh
[09:52] <godmachine81> good job
[09:52] <ubuntu> sethk: godmachine81: thank you both very very much!
[09:52] <n1gke> I liked the left-coast from time to time.
[09:52] <godmachine81> your welcome
[09:53] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: You still here? Haha
[09:53] <avagant> n1gke: It's CRAZY out here, and sometimes in not good ways.
[09:53] <cafuego> iter: Well, you can install onto a single drive, defining raid arrays with only one partition.
[09:53] <n1gke> I know.
[09:53] <Coffeegrinds> yup doin some wiki readin
[09:53] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I havn't tried that yet
[09:53] <n1gke> Trust me, I've been around
[09:53] <sethk> godmachine81, I didn't say _I_ can't do the octal conversion, I said it is not smart to do it that way.  but forget it, I'm apparently the only one in the world who understands that argument (well, other than the people who wrote chmod, but that's another story)
[09:53] <iter> cafuego: copy system to third drive, create array, copy back to array
[09:53] <cafuego> iter: ... and the after plugging drive #2 later tell it to rebuild.
[09:53] <avagant> I apparently moved into the meth capital of the world.
[09:53] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: I'll give it another go sometime today.
[09:53] <n1gke> omg !
[09:53] <avagant> Not knowing that of course.
[09:53] <cafuego> iter: Yah
[09:53] <n1gke> That stinks.
[09:53] <avagant> And got robbed.
[09:53] <DigitalNinja> epsilon_: Time for some coffee
[09:53] <avagant> 2000 dollars worth of possessions.
[09:53] <jbroome> avagant: well, sleep is over rated
[09:53] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja then it's just time for that... my second favourite is suse, it knows everything
[09:54] <epsilon_> DigitalNinja ok :)
[09:54] <avagant> jbroome: Haha.
[09:54] <iter> djmccormick: you hear all that
[09:54] <n1gke> My brides cousin has recently moved back here from the left coast and is very thankful to have done so,
[09:54] <jbroome> DigitalNinja: see avagant for some meth. :P
[09:54] <avagant> jbroome: I would NEVER touch that crap you kidding? I watched my other halfs step sister for a ocuple months while she was doing that.
[09:54] <n1gke> sleep ?
[09:54] <ubuntu> sethk: i thought it must be somthing to do with the permissions higher up than just /home/bob and the others.. seing as it affected all of them.
[09:54] <Coffeegrinds> OUCH!  well I'm in montreal now and we have issues with cokeheads like it was the early 80's all over. well that and tourists
[09:54] <n1gke> What is that ?Can I donwload sleep ?
[09:54] <iter> avagant: only BOUGHT the drugs, he didn't use them ;)
[09:54] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: Haha, and all there is to do in PA is drink.
[09:54] <sethk> ubuntu, the search permission on /home affects every directory in /home
[09:54] <avagant> iter: HAHAH
[09:55] <sethk> ubuntu, every file and directory in /home
[09:55] <avagant> uhhhh sxe?
[09:55] <ubuntu> sethk: i thought only if you use -R
[09:55] <avagant> ok ok, I lied.
[09:55] <avagant> but yah sxe.
[09:55] <ubuntu> sethk: but then, you wouldnt be able to go deeper anyway.. i suppose
[09:55] <n1gke> Coffeegrinds, I really enjoyed Montreal and watching the F-1 races, but ya' know, OMG, I am glad to live/exist/reside in Rhode Island !
[09:55] <sethk> ubuntu, chmod changes only /home, without the -R.  it is the permissions on /home that were the problem, though
[09:55] <gumpish> "Your architecutre, 'ppc', is not supported by the Macromedia Flash Player installer." :(
[09:55] <new-install> i'm trying to install edgy to a partition on an existing system.  i specify / on /dev/sdb2, and a swap partition on /dev/sdb5.  when i try to continue, the "prepare mount points" tells me "No root file system", even though i have specified it on /dev/sdb2.  what's going on?
[09:55] <djmccormick> iter: basically... install to a temp drive is the best idea? then create the array and copy back into the array and set it to boot?
[09:56] <BAzfH> hi
[09:56] <sethk> ubuntu, because, without search permission on /home, you can't find any file under /home, regardless of the permissions of those files.  you see?
[09:56] <avagant> n1gke: I had a friend John that lived in PA from Rhode Island. His accent drove me crazy. Haha
[09:56] <iter> djmccormick: nah if you're going to install just make the array at install time
[09:56] <n1gke> lolol
[09:56] <n1gke> Yeh huh
[09:56] <lasindi> Hi everyone, I'm trying to install an HP DeskJet 420 parallel port printer, but it doesn't detect my printer automatically. Should I manually specify LPT#1 as the port?
[09:56] <avagant> I seriously couldn't understand a word he was saying.
[09:56] <ubuntu> sethk: cool, thnx (back to readin man chmod/chown/etc) :)
[09:56] <djmccormick> iter: ah... where is that done?
[09:56] <n1gke> lasindi, hello.
[09:56] <ubuntu> sethk: thnx
[09:56] <ubuntu> later all!
[09:56] <n1gke> Ciao ubuntu....
[09:56] <lasindi> n1gke: hello
[09:56] <avagant> Everyone tells me I have one, but uh i'm from PA if you aren't living in Pitt it isn't "dahn tahn" and in other regions likewise.
[09:57] <iter> djmccormick: while the installer is running switch to another terminal and setup array
[09:57] <n1gke> lol @ ava
[09:57] <cafuego> aiyeee!
[09:57] <djmccormick> iter: mdadm will be available?
[09:57] <avagant> DONT update to edgy unless you are absolutley sure.
[09:57] <sethk> avagant, hey, everybody knows youse guys in Pa don't talk too goodly
[09:57] <avagant> The graphics are snappy.
[09:57] <n1gke> lasindi, I can't help, but thught I'd say hello anyway.
[09:57] <iter> djmccormick: good question, because I haven't actually done it that way
[09:57] <avagant> sethk: Hahaha.
[09:57] <BAzfH> i have a problem with ubuntu edgy and wireless, maybe someone could help me? okay problem is as follow: wlan card is pci with msi pc54g3 - as far as i read in the forums it does not work with the normal edgy drivers, therefore i need to get the drivers from ratech. but after i build and configured them my system freezes when trying to setup network with ifup
[09:57] <epsilon_> avagant its okay :D
[09:57] <Coffeegrinds> algke see thats the fun part about living here, i grew up just off the island as a kid, but my dad was military so we moved after grade 5, so it's kinda like I'm a tourist in my own city now that I'm 25. i just moved back last year. /sadly worked all through F1
[09:57] <lasindi> n1gke: ah, ok :-)
[09:57] <iter> djmccormick: I just setup system drive and then used two others for array
[09:58] <avagant> my other half says youse all the time, it's pretty funny.
[09:58] <djmccormick> iter: i'll try it out. what's the key combo to get to a terminal? isn't it ctrl+alt+F2 or something?
[09:58] <BAzfH> anybody here who had similar problems or has an idea to track that down?
[09:58] <n1gke> Oh she's from jois'y avagant ?
[09:58] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: I moved alot as a child, but resided in good ole' Erie PA for 15 years.
[09:58] <iter> djmccormick: just alt-f2 in terminal, ctrl-alt-f2 from xwindows
[09:58] <sethk> avagant, hmm, that's usually New York.  PA people say "alls" a lot
[09:58] <avagant> no, she is from Buffalo.
[09:58] <avagant> haha
[09:58] <n1gke> oic
[09:59] <Tonren> Hey guys, I didn't see any boot-up notes during Ubuntu's splash bootup period.  That is, I didn't see stuff like "Mounting root file system", "Configuring network interfaces", etc.  But I'm hanging on "Configuring network interfaces" just like I used to, and I can't Ctrl + C out of it!
[09:59] <Tonren> I just upgraded to Edgy.
[09:59] <avagant> She also says "walmart-s" instead of walmart.
[09:59] <avagant> Putting an s at the end of everything, good times.
[09:59] <BAzfH> Tonren: that is normal behaviour in edgy. but you can remove the quiet option from the boot params
[09:59] <cafuego> Tonren: Hmmyeah. upgrading usually does something wrong, best bet is to backup data nd do a fresh install.
[09:59] <eyequeue> Tonren, that's normal, but if you want, i can tell you how to get those back
[09:59] <sethk> avagant, that's ok, one of my ex-wives goes to "traders joe"
[10:00] <new-install> why is the installer telling me "no root file system" even though i have specified sdb2 as the / partition?
[10:00] <avagant> Oh noeeessssssss I have heard of em, is that a NY thing?
[10:00] <avagant> trader joe's, or maybe they had one in pitt when we lived there.
[10:00] <Tonren> eyequeue: To get them back, do I remove the "quiet" option in GRUB like BAzfH said?
[10:01] <action09> anyone has an evolution blackout ?
[10:01] <action09> :)
[10:01] <eyequeue> avagant, the "s-ing" of words isn't a ny thing, i've never heard it there
[10:01] <avagant> At any rate Cali sucks, I can't wait to get back home but hopefully before the weather gets horrible.
[10:01] <avagant> I don't know maybe it's a buffalo thing.
[10:01] <iter> djmccormick: http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html
[10:01] <iter> djmccormick: might be useful
[10:01] <avagant> like walmarts, kmarts, etc.
[10:01] <eyequeue> Tonren, yes, then sudo update-grub afterward
[10:01] <BAzfH> Tonren: yes you definitely do
[10:01] <Tonren> eyequeue: Alternately, I'd love to be able to specify, in interfaces, to not bother configuring if there's nothing plugged into the ethernet port.
[10:02] <Tonren> eyequeue: BAzfH: Frankly, I think it's ridiculous that Ubuntu still has that behavior.  I was thinking of disabling it on boot entirely, and having it run on Gnome startup.
[10:02] <avagant> and everything is "down this house, down that house" in Pitt. Haha
[10:02] <majiq> i can't start X since i added the LRM repo for nvidia drivers. today my linux-restricted-modules was auto-updated and now X won't start. :( what should i do?
[10:02] <avagant> Go back to an older update and hope for the best?
[10:02] <xuser> Anyone seen rdesktop acting weird in edgy?
[10:02] <avagant> Sorry that's not good advice.
[10:02] <sethk> avagant, actually they are a west coast thing, they have started to open stores in the East only recently.
[10:02] <eyequeue> Tonren, you do or don't want the boot messages?  some like quiet as default, i want as much info as possible, heh
[10:02] <BAzfH> anybody around who solved lockup problems with rt61 wlan chip at ifup? (using ratech drivers? or maybe someone got rt61 wlan chip running with the 'standard' drivers?
[10:02] <avagant> I'm surprized how stable my Edgy install is.
[10:03] <avagant> It's kind of spooky in a way.
[10:03] <sethk> brb
[10:03] <Tonren> eyequeue: The only reason I want the boot messages is so I can Ctrl + C out of "Configuring network interfaces..." because it hangs when I'm not plugged in.
[10:03] <jordan> avagant: FYI, the update fixes the nvidia security issue
[10:03] <avagant> Maybe it was out here, sethk.
[10:03] <paulv> is reportbug the appropriate tool to report bugs with?
[10:03] <Tonren> eyequeue: If I can somehow specify, in /etc/networking/interfaces, to not bother with configuring if there's nothing plugged in, I'd rather do that.
[10:03] <BAzfH> avagant: i maybe would be surprised if wlan would run :-((
[10:03] <avagant> BAzfH: Me and ubuntu have a very long history of beating each other up, so this working flawlessly the first time is kind of disturbing.
[10:03] <eyequeue> Tonren, ah, put the quiet back in once you find a real fix.  i had to run nosplash for a while until edgy got fixed
[10:03] <new-install> why is the edgy installer telling me "no root file system" even though i have specified sdb2 as the / partition?
[10:04] <majiq> avagant: (if you were talking to me) .. i dunno how to get back to the older version
[10:04] <Tonren> eyequeue: Where is GRUB's rc?
[10:04] <BAzfH> avagant: hehe.. i have a history like that, too
[10:04] <avagant> Isn't there a "downgrade" option at the prompt for apt-get?
[10:04] <avagant> I was reading "man apt-get" last night.
[10:04] <BAzfH> oh well .. only when upgrading and in some early days even with fresh installs
[10:04] <eyequeue> Tonren, /boot/grub/menu.list is probably what you want
[10:05] <avagant> BAzfH: Albiet the update manager with 7 minutes left disappeared and I had to do a dist-upgrade the rest of the way through but other then that, flawless.
[10:05] <majiq> avagant: i'll check. thanks
[10:05] <savvas_> i need some guidance with iptables, i want to limit each users to two processes that use the internet simultaneously. is it possible?
[10:05] <abnerian> Hey, does Ubuntu have a dedicated Wifi channel?
[10:05] <jbroome> no, here's fine
[10:05] <Tonren> eyequeue: Oh, god.  The system terminal font is now horribly anti-aliased.  What's a good alternative?
[10:05] <epsilon_> !wifi
[10:05] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[10:05] <avagant> majiq: Ya don't quote me on that, but I think you might be able to get your old kernel back.
[10:05] <abnerian> Ah. Uh...how do I get my wifi working, XD?
[10:05] <BAzfH> avagant: hehe.. at work dapper -> edgy worked almost flawless. except there was a bootup problem
[10:05] <abnerian> I have an Atheros card, ath0.
[10:05] <avagant> sudo ifup eth0?
[10:05] <eyequeue> Tonren, not sure, i'm not a font guy
[10:05] <abnerian> i'll try that
[10:06] <abnerian> Be gentle, I'm new to Ubuntu.
[10:06] <avagant> BAzfH: I had to netboot to Dapper, and then upgrade to Edgy.
[10:06] <avagant> From Windows, because my cd player decided it's having a bad week.
[10:06] <abnerian> Says ath0 is already configured.
[10:06] <avagant> Hmm.
[10:06] <BAzfH> lol
[10:06] <abnerian> >.> What does that mean?
[10:06] <avagant> I don't know much about wifi.
[10:06] <abnerian> Also, my wireless has WPA.
[10:06] <avagant> Have you checked the forums?
[10:06] <abnerian> Nay.
[10:07] <avagant> Or the dapper guide or anything?
[10:07] <avagant> www.ubuntuforums.org
[10:07] <BAzfH> i would be really lucky if i had a ath0 instead of my f*cking ra0
[10:07] <abnerian> ...can I tell you something embarassing?
[10:07] <avagant> rut roh.
[10:07] <abnerian> I have no idea what version of Ubuntu this is.
[10:07] <Coffeegrinds> and I'm back.. upgrade gave me an error
[10:07] <avagant> uname -a
[10:07] <abnerian> And no idea how to find out.
[10:07] <BAzfH> there are severals hundred people around having problems with it in edgy
[10:07] <eyequeue> !version
[10:07] <ubotu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type 'lsb_release -a' in the Terminal.
[10:07] <BAzfH> with a dozen of possible solutions
[10:07] <BAzfH> but none seems to work for me :-(((
[10:07] <eyequeue> abnerian, ^
[10:07] <avagant> BAzfH: I'm still crossing my fingers.
[10:07] <abnerian> Dapper.
[10:08] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: hmm.
[10:08] <avagant> What kind of error?
[10:08] <abnerian> I'm not going to upgrade to Edge until they fix everything.
[10:08] <BAzfH> i'm currently thinking of downloading a dapper iso
[10:08] <avagant> abnerian: GOOD idea.
[10:08] <Coffeegrinds> couldn't connect to ftp connection frefused.. \
[10:08] <avagant> oh snap.
[10:08] <BAzfH> but it will take so long again:((
[10:08] <avagant> you got a firewall or anything?
[10:08] <Coffeegrinds> not on my mob
[10:08] <Coffeegrinds> box..
[10:08] <Tonren> Oh lord... can anyone tell me how to stop the horrible Edgy anti-aliasing in Gnome-Terminal?  It's nauseating.
[10:08] <avagant> oh snap.
[10:08] <avagant> <_<
[10:08] <avagant> >_>
[10:09] <BAzfH> well... BUT .. edgy is great! real great!
[10:09] <Coffeegrinds> hmm can't i just upgrade using my cd as a source?
[10:09] <avagant> BAzfH: Eh it's just flashier, it actually to me doesn't boot up any faster then Dapper did.
[10:09] <avagant> I think with all the tweaking I did to my dapper it actually booted faster.
[10:09] <BAzfH> it's running fine at work (seems as it wants me to do my work) .. but doesn't at home (it doesn't want me to work at home)
[10:09] <BAzfH> heheheh
[10:10] <jda487> hi there,
[10:10] <avagant> BAzfH: Haha. Edgy is trying to be your mom.
[10:10] <Tonren> Mein gott... this is like an apocalypse.  MPD doesn't work.  Tilda doesn't work.  Do I even have sound?!
[10:10] <avagant> It's a parental authority.
[10:10] <BAzfH> oh.. thats a late start for someone to be my mom
[10:10] <avagant> hahaha.
[10:10] <eyequeue> will edgy cook my dinner?
[10:10] <avagant> Hahaha.
[10:10] <BHSPitLappy> will edgy do my laundry?
[10:10] <epsilon_> no, but it brings some coffee every morning.
[10:10] <u221e> I just lowered my screen resolution but now my emacs' fonts look like crap... How can I fix this?
[10:10] <avagant> It's got a lasanga in the oven for me (I can't spell)
=== savvas_ is now known as savvas
[10:11] <avagant> oh wait, that's my other half.
[10:11] <epsilon_> (anyway i dont like coffee)
[10:11] <BHSPitLappy> lasagna
[10:11] <max_> is there anyway to mount as iso to a virtual drive in kde?
[10:11] <georgy> BAzfH : use ratech drivers and here a tuto in french http://www.bawet.org/article.php3?id_article=136
[10:11] <avagant> DANG ALMOST
[10:11] <epsilon_> max_ yes
[10:11] <BAzfH> It's like you are going to have a paid girl - after several years of sex drugs and rock'n'roll - but your mom comes up to tell you that you are too young
[10:11] <epsilon_> max_ ill give you a link in a sec
[10:11] <avagant> Hahaha.
[10:11] <BHSPitLappy> max_, sudo mount -o loop image.iso /media/place
[10:11] <BAzfH> georgy: i tried to use them
[10:11] <epsilon_> !iso > max_
[10:11] <avagant> Oh man, comedy comedy.
[10:12] <BAzfH> georgy: doing ifup ra0 after doing through tuts results in a total lockup of my system
[10:12] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: If anything read some wiki's, I don't know if there's a way to update using that I've been very unlucky (like yourself) with cd's and what not.
[10:12] <Coffeegrinds> actually just found it
[10:12] <Coffeegrinds> http://www.debianadmin.com/upgrade-ubuntu-dapper-to-ubuntu-edgy-eft.html
[10:12] <georgy> BAzfH, : ok, but works great in dapper
[10:12] <BAzfH> :-(
[10:12] <avagant> I used insulinux on windows to get Dapper.
[10:13] <avagant> That took almost 4 hours to finish.
[10:13] <BAzfH> seems like i really need to invest 2 hours to download it
[10:13] <max_> BHSPitLappy: in the "place" what do i put there?
[10:13] <BAzfH> ... again
[10:13] <avagant> AND I had to use the UK mirror.
[10:13] <BAzfH> okay. i revise my opinion
[10:13] <Artemis3> Hi there, i tried to burn a dvd using brasero 4.4 in simulation, seeing that it was taking too long i canceled, and now the drive refuses to eject the disc. Any ideas?
[10:13] <BAzfH> i think: edgy sucks out of hell.
[10:13] <BAzfH> ;))
[10:13] <forevertheuni> hello there I'm using edgy...and I can't pair to my bluetooth headset(however in dapper worked great) I googled a lot no answers came tried a few things didn't help :/ so how can I install only and just only dapper bluez packages and kdebluetooth?
[10:13] <avagant> I don't know if it's maybe the disks I was using but these burnt cd's don't last very long.
[10:13] <Tonren> Please... someone HAS to know how to stop the monospace anti-aliasing in edgy
[10:13] <forevertheuni> BAzfH: that's true :D
[10:13] <BAzfH> well then
[10:13] <eegore> is there a way to test if the 5.1 surround connections are plugged in correctly
[10:14] <avagant> The first ubuntu cd I burned lasted 3 reinstalls, but after that each one I burnt has a lifespan of maybe 1 install if I'm lucky.
[10:14] <BAzfH> lets download ubuntu (i really *hate* having to say this) dapper and hopefully get happy
[10:14] <BHSPitLappy> max_, sudo mkdir /media/iso     (or whatever you want the directory to be named, then use THAT place)
[10:14] <avagant> The first time I downloaded Ubuntu it seriously took 30 minutes to get the iso.
[10:14] <georgy> BAzfH : hopoe for you, good luck
[10:15] <avagant> Each time after that it's taken like an hour to almost 2.
[10:15] <avagant> I have cable, it shouldn't take THAT long.
[10:15] <BAzfH> at moments like this i would really hope that i could have a broadband connection with more than 1 MBit
[10:15] <avagant> speed tweak maybe? :D
[10:15] <BAzfH> but on the landside of the world you can be lucky to have 1 mbit
[10:16] <epsilon_> BAzfH landside?
[10:16] <Artemis3> it seems that the drive is getting hot, so failing to see a reason i better restart. Somehow i'm feeling nautilus is bothering the other cd burn apps
[10:16] <MasseR> I have 10mbps here. I think sweden gave almost everybody a broadband
[10:16] <max_> BHSPitLappy: after that what do i do?
[10:16] <avagant> There's alot more background stuff going on in Edgy.
[10:16] <avagant> Stuff I've never even heard of before.
[10:16] <BHSPitLappy> max_, use that directory you created in the mount command...
[10:17] <max_> i did
[10:17] <max_> what do i do after the mount command/>'
[10:17] <tiede> Hi all. I am using an image as my nautilus background. Can someone tell me how I can make it not scroll when I scroll down in the folder?
[10:17] <BHSPitLappy> and obviously replace image.iso with the path to your file
[10:17] <avagant> I'm gonna have to learn more about mounting iso's and grub and what not until I can afford a decent computer with cdplayer that works.
[10:17] <BAzfH> epsilon_: well don't know how to tell it right. eng is not my native lang
[10:17] <Coffeegrinds> Avagant the upgrade from install cd instructions are on the url that i last posted, in the reply's check the admins post 7
[10:17] <max_> yes, i did that
[10:17] <max_> now what
[10:17] <BHSPitLappy> max_, then just go to that place in a file browser!
[10:17] <BAzfH> oh i am really really really lucky
[10:17] <epsilon_> BAzfH which country do you live in? :)
[10:17] <BAzfH> must have been in good mood when i took one of my dapper cds from work to home
[10:18] <BAzfH> epsilon_: germany
[10:18] <epsilon_> BAzfH im in hungary and 1 mb is average... (i have 2, but there is 3 mb or 512 kb)
[10:18] <avagant> Yah but I also have cox cable, and they are ALWAYS down.
[10:19] <avagant> Somedays I don't get more than 56k at best, somedays I get like 3mb.
[10:19] <cryptonic> has anyone else had problems with open wengo 2.0 and edgy?
[10:19] <max_> BHSPitLappy: how do i create the directory?
[10:19] <fiveiron> nice... my x server is broken now
[10:19] <BHSPitLappy> max_, sudo mkdir /media/wherever
[10:19] <BHSPitLappy> you told me you already did
[10:20] <BAzfH> but i live their at a place near mnchengladbach where so far is only a river, a few threes, the street to the next bigger city (viersen) and some houses
[10:20] <avagant> I think my din din is almost ready.
[10:20] <BAzfH> do you now understand why i can be lucky to have 1 mbit, epsilon_?
[10:20] <max_> ok, i see it
[10:20] <epsilon_> BAzfH ahh ok :) i live in budapest so the net is ok
[10:20] <BAzfH> ah.. i'm happy
[10:21] <max_> after i make the Folder how do i mount it?
[10:21] <BAzfH> lets try to install ubuntu
[10:21] <tiede> anyone with a little nautilus knowledge? How do I disable background-scrolling? I can't find it in Gconf...
[10:21] <BAzfH> eh well. someone experienced if running xfs as main system with dapper is safe?
[10:21] <avagant> Wow, I read that Coffeegrinds, I guess I did end up doing edgy upgrade right.
[10:21] <BAzfH> (except for /booot))
[10:21] <jda487> hey, quick question... I am trying to install ndiswrapper so I can use my wireless card however it fails to compile.  any suggestions?  I am a Ubuntu noob.
[10:21] <BHSPitLappy> max_, you're asking me things I've already given you the answers to.
[10:21] <BAzfH> s/system/filesystem/g
[10:21] <max_> its confusing
[10:21] <BHSPitLappy> max_, things you've said you did already
[10:21] <avagant> Now if I could learn Ruby or Python, I'd be set.
[10:21] <cryptonic> has anyone installed wengo2.o on edgy?
[10:22] <Coffeegrinds> avagant.. pfft hardly it was seeming to work for a second thne something crapped out
[10:22] <BHSPitLappy> max_, you can scroll up instead of asking me to repeat myself...
[10:22] <eegore> Well it looks like the CS server is still running
[10:22] <avagant> Oh if you get edgy to install ALWAYS remember to dpkg afterwords or you'll notice like 1gb missing from your hd.
[10:22] <avagant> Which isn't much if you have like 200gb's but for a measily 10gb'er like me that's alot of space. Haha.
[10:22] <BAzfH> epsilon_: you lucky one
[10:23] <BAzfH> lalal. now installing dapper. lets see if it likes my hardware
[10:23] <avagant> Coffeegrind, maybe the server is down? Or whatever technicaly speak?
[10:23] <max_> BHSPitLappy: i did <sudo mount -o loop image.iso /media/iso> and nothing showed up and nothing is in the <iso> file
[10:23] <max_> folder*
[10:23] <BAzfH> hmm. btw. is someone experiencing a _fast_ boot experience with upstart?
[10:23] <BAzfH> here and at work it takes longer then init
[10:23] <avagant> BAzfH: If you have any problems go to www.ubuntuforums.org and look for help.
[10:24] <BAzfH> avagant: i always do :-)
[10:24] <avagant> Yah BAzfH I don't see how the new upstart is any faster.
[10:24] <avagant> oh and tell me i'm stupid: sktfeelsdapper
=== cyrus is now known as sabu
[10:24] <^pixel__> sometimes I make an archive of many files! But when I Extract the file, it seems that files are missing from it!  Is this a bug?
[10:24] <cafuego> you are SO stupid
[10:24] <Tonren> Some of my panel icons aren't fully transparent: http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a141/maxcantor/panel.jpg  How should I edit them to let the styled panel show through?
[10:24] <epsilon_> max_ try sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 ....
[10:24] <BAzfH> avagant: I only come to irc if everything else fails (like rtfm, rtfm more, rtfm more once again, reading forums, ..)
[10:24] <BHSPitLappy> max_, I have to go
[10:25] <avagant> I did the disabling of all the extra stuff I don't have, and my boot speed wsa like 30 seconds, on edgy it's almost a minute.
[10:25] <^pixel__> cafuego: any ideas?
[10:25] <avagant> bootchart FTW.
[10:25] <avagant> Coffeegrinds: Hey you, do you have aim?
[10:25] <sabu> got a question. I am trying to install the nvidia drivers from the website and it tells me I need to be in root, which I understand, however, when I try to log onto the machine as root, it doesnt like the username

[10:26] <scamboy> good morning asia....
[10:26] <epsilon_> WAAAAAA koules doesn't work!! :O the bestest game!!
[10:26] <avagant> I need new friends, my pa friends don't even know I'm in Cali.
[10:26] <scamboy> bazfh: dun expect that in edgy..hehehe
[10:27] <avagant> They know I left, but all think I'm home already.
[10:27] <BAzfH> dappper was a good release. as far as i heard so far (and was i experienced yet) edgy is far from being good
[10:27] <abnerian> Hey. I'm typing this from my kitchen.
[10:27] <scamboy> !offtopic|avagant
[10:27] <ubotu> avagant: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:27] <abnerian> Thanks.
[10:27] <CientificoLoco> hello everybody I switch from Windows to Ubuntu; in windows I used "shoutcast" for independent internet broadcasters; is there some software that is the similar of shoutcast? and in which program can I use it?
[10:27] <avagant> Hahah ya ya.,
[10:27] <BAzfH> it is like .. well it has been released within 4months
[10:27] <abnerian> Works very well now.
[10:27] <abnerian> I do have two questions, though...
[10:27] <rotorhead> hi! which package should i get for my "core 2 duo" system? the i386 or the AMD64 ?
[10:27] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco for internet radio or for making it?
[10:27] <FirstStrike> rotorhead: i386
[10:27] <scamboy> !ask|abnerian
[10:27] <ubotu> abnerian: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:27] <FirstStrike> AMD64 is for AMD processors
[10:27] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, for internet radio.
[10:27] <BAzfH> rotorhead: how the hell do you come to the conclusion to need amd kernel for intel hardware?
[10:28] <BAzfH> thats absurd
[10:28] <^pixel__> cafuego: pls stop trolling and answer the question :)
[10:28] <avagant> This soap is tearing my apart.
[10:28] <abnerian> 1) I used an external USB drive. I unplugged it and it still shows on my desktop.
[10:28] <^pixel__> cafuego: sometimes I make an archive of many files! But when I Extract the file, it seems that files are missing from it!  Is this a bug?
[10:28] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco momnent then
[10:28] <abnerian> Why?
[10:28] <abnerian> it's a minor annoyance
[10:28] <Coffeegrinds> moment of zen right here
[10:28] <roycebarber> Help...Flash9 has totally screwed up my internet browsing. It's EVIL. How do I kill it and get back to the stable Flash7??????
[10:28] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco the default player, rhytmbox supports shoutcast radios.
[10:28] <avagant> With robes and shaved heads, Coffeegrinds?
[10:28] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco i tried them yesterday :)
[10:28] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, no so I think is for making it.
[10:28] <scamboy> abnerian: you must right click unmount before unplug..
[10:28] <jeebo> hi there. i'm trying to keep some dapper sources in my edgy sources.list. this results in dist-upgrade reverting from upstart to sysvinit. i couldn't resolve this problem through pinning. so does anybody have a tip or is this discouraged?
[10:28] <abnerian> Uh oh.
[10:28] <Coffeegrinds> not quite ..one sec
[10:28] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, I want to transmit on air..
[10:29] <roycebarber> Flash9 was programmed by undead army of windows errors....
[10:29] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco ahh ok :D
[10:29] <^pixel__> roycebarber: flash9 totally fixed all my internet browsing
[10:29] <BAzfH> uh..
[10:29] <avagant> roycebarber: Hahahaha.
[10:29] <BAzfH> flash9 is out for linux?
[10:29] <abnerian> Now how  do I get rid of it?
[10:29] <^pixel__> roycebarber: install Opera
[10:29] <CientificoLoco> you know epsilon_ talk for people and put music, and bla bla...
[10:29] <BAzfH> that is great!
[10:29] <rotorhead> hehe....isn't there any 64bix release for intel systems?
[10:29] <BAzfH> really
[10:29] <avagant> flash9 actually fixed it for me too, until I go to myspace.
[10:29] <rotorhead> bit
[10:29] <avagant> and the stupid idiots with 9000 things all over their profiles.
[10:29] <^pixel__> avagant: what happens at myspace?
[10:29] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco, i see. moment :)
[10:29] <CientificoLoco> ok.
[10:29] <^pixel__> avagant: then use Opera to visit myspace!  prob solved :)
[10:29] <avagant> Uh everything completely freezes and I can't exit out of firefox.
[10:29] <scamboy> flash9 works fine..
[10:29] <roycebarber> Well... Flash9 worked for awhile, i only installed it to watch CNET videos. but it freezes YouTube videos!
[10:30] <^pixel__> avagant: then use Opera! prob fixed :)
[10:30] <BAzfH> eh.. people
[10:30] <Coffeegrinds> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30210/
[10:30] <avagant> did you do the aoss thing, royce?
[10:30] <scamboy> freeze ..the a  bit...
[10:30] <abnerian> Also
[10:30] <roycebarber> AOSS thing? whats that mean?????
[10:30] <^pixel__> roycebarber: flash9 actually fixed mytube videos :
[10:30] <BAzfH> do you think at the debian people things will be better with edge than with ubuntu edgy? =)
[10:30] <Coffeegrinds> wtf?
[10:30] <avagant> where you change firefox to use alsa instead of the default.
[10:30] <BAzfH> (no i dont want to start a debian ./ ubuntu flame ;)
[10:30] <abnerian> I had another question: is XGL worth the trouble?
[10:30] <avagant> LOL at name.
[10:30] <^pixel__> sometimes I make an archive of many files! But when I Extract the file, it seems that files are missing from it!  Is this a bug?
[10:30] <^pixel__> anyone know pls?
[10:30] <avagant> nice name, coffeegrinds.
[10:31] <roycebarber> Avagant how would I go about doing that? Flash worked great before i installed flash9...
[10:31] <abnerian> Should I try to install XGL?
[10:31] <BAzfH> ^pixel__: i believe we read your question.. but maybe nobody knows ;o)
[10:31] <scamboy> !xgl

[10:31] <max_> how do i set my SDISPLAY
[10:31] <FirstStrike> only if you're ready to do some tweaking and make backups
[10:31] <Coffeegrinds> it twas always sposed to be grindah. however irc killed the last char
[10:31] <avagant> do you use alsa, or do you use esd, etc?
[10:32] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco, bad news. there is a wiki article on ubuntu wiki (search for shoutcast) but it's very complicated. what is the name of the shoutcast application in windows?
[10:32] <BAzfH> ehhh...
[10:32] <avagant> Coffee, I mean your console name.
[10:32] <Coffeegrinds> hehehhe
[10:32] <avagant> geek-a-tron haha
[10:32] <Coffeegrinds> yeah..
[10:32] <Coffeegrinds> can't help it
[10:32] <avagant> mine was suppose to be "unsung"
[10:32] <roycebarber> I dont know what I use... I'm not sure.. i just want help and im too newbie to know what to do...
[10:32] <avagant> but it came out skt@skt which is really lame.
[10:32] <BAzfH> why does dapper recognize my sata disk as an usb device and my usb harddisk as a sata device??
[10:32] <christoph__> DISPLAY=localhost:0
[10:32] <BAzfH> I'm .. eh.. wondering
[10:33] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, "shotcast" the distrivucion is winamp
[10:33] <BAzfH> yeah. thats the word
[10:33] <Coffeegrinds> BazfH .. because.. just because...
[10:33] <avagant> because what could be happening, royce is esd and alsa are fighting for your soundcard.
[10:33] <cdubya> I'm booting an older machine with the 6.06 Desktop CD and trying to mount the primary drive (it has Debian installed) so that I can copy some files from it as the drive is failing. The dir I need to get to is hidden, so when I mount, it doesn't ever show up. Is there any way around this?
[10:33] <BAzfH> okay. hopefully i don
[10:33] <avagant> Causing it to freeze up.
[10:33] <max_> how do i set my SDISPLAY
[10:33] <BAzfH> i don't mess things up
[10:33] <roycebarber> Avagant I would love to eliminate any errors.
[10:33] <avagant> I should be the expert at alsa set up because it took me 2 weeks to figure that stuff out.
[10:33] <scamboy> Sdisplay!
[10:33] <[myg0t] s0beit> sup
[10:33] <avagant> And about 900 reinstalls.

[10:34] <Coffeegrinds> well i have precisely 30 minutes to figure out what the h3ll is going on here
[10:34] <adrenaline> I can access my mp3's across the network with the players xmms amorok but they won't play does anybody have any ideas of why?
[10:34] <yahalom> can someone confirm that ndiswrapper is broken in edgy?
[10:34] <Coffeegrinds> well i have precisely 30 minutes to figure out what the h3ll is going on here
[10:34] <avagant> Royce, have you tried www.ubuntuforums.org
[10:34] <Coffeegrinds> ouch .. big reset there
[10:34] <avagant> Coffee, or the message will self distruct?
[10:34] <scamboy> adrenaline: you have codecs??

[10:35] <Coffeegrinds> who'\s having firefox flash issues
[10:35] <scamboy> max: wat you mean sdisplay??
[10:35] <roycebarber> I will goto ubuntuforums and see what i find
[10:35] <avagant> roycebarber: .
[10:35] <BAzfH> hehe.. funny that the installer likes to check fat32 partitions for no reason
[10:35] <faux> max_: you mean $DISPLAY, set with export $DISPLAY
[10:35] <andyb> max_: do you mean $DISPLAY ?
[10:35] <max_> yes
[10:35] <avagant> royce, that's how I figured out all my problems.
[10:35] <roycebarber> I'm having problem with flash9 i dont know why it freezes firefox and wont let me play flash videos
[10:35] <avagant> Well besides the obvious ones.
=== kremy is now known as mortalius
[10:36] <avagant> Also flash9 is apparently a beta.
[10:36] <scamboy> max: look for the function monitor, in admin or system..
[10:36] <Coffeegrinds> someone in one sec I'll get that fixed .. i haved the text that got it running for me ... whole aoss BS isn't the issue
[10:36] <epsilon_> CientificoLoco, so you use a winamp plugin for making shoutcast radio?
[10:36] <adrenaline> scamboy, yes it plays locally and it also works across the network in debian and windows
[10:36] <avagant> Oh it isn't? yah see, that's the only thing I could think of.
[10:36] <avagant> I have alsa on the brain.
[10:36] <adrenaline> seems to be a ubuntu thing
[10:36] <scamboy> !display|max

[10:37] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, with the help of winamp.. I add music wiht it
[10:37] <avagant> I'm afraid to test and see if I can actually get more than one thing to play.
[10:37] <BAzfH> oh.. epsilon_ thats an interesting topic. is there a possibility to do non castrated (i hope this is the right word in english) shoutcast streaming under linux?
[10:37] <avagant> I'm gonna see if my dinner is ready.
[10:37] <avagant> Haha
[10:37] <Artemis3> hello again now i am burning a data dvd with nautilus, but its very slow, 1x like :(
[10:37] <cdubya> anyone know how I can mount a hidden dir on a drive that's not the boot drive so that I can copy some files from it/
[10:37] <Tonren> Some of my panel icons aren't fully transparent: http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a141/maxcantor/panel.jpg  How should I edit them to let the styled panel show through?
[10:37] <KMandla> Howdy!
[10:37] <brentcool> is there any way for the default ftp program to support tab completion for typing out long file names?
[10:37] <avagant> artemis are you burning ubuntu?
[10:37] <scamboy> artemis3: maybe you drive is old???:)
[10:38] <djmccormick> iter: i got that all in fine but the installer can't format the disk. has to have direct access. i guess i'm going to have to somehow stick this damned driver in.
[10:38] <avagant> it's better to burn ubuntu at slow speeds otherwise your disc asplode.
[10:38] <notwist> is there any way for me to disable a soundcard?
[10:38] <notwist> i have 2 and one of them I do not want to use
[10:38] <brentcool> i love notwist the band
[10:38] <Artemis3> avagant, not ubuntu, data files
[10:38] <BAzfH> notwist: blacklist the module
[10:38] <notwist> brentcool: hehe :)
[10:38] <fbn> can somebody tell me how to set up a wlan connection on edgy eft?
[10:38] <adrenaline> This is the busiest channel on freenode
[10:38] <notwist> BAzfH: how?
[10:38] <avagant> put it on the blacklist, and comment it out?
=== highneko_ is now known as highnko
[10:38] <Coffeegrinds> roycebarber: next pastebin is for you
[10:39] <florides> Hi
[10:39] <BAzfH> notwist: i assume you have different sound cards? (maybe one on board?)
[10:39] <brentcool> so nobody uses tab completion with ftp?
[10:39] <avagant> Coffee, I'm sorry! I just realized it's my fault you are having Edgy issues.
[10:39] <KMandla> I'm digging around for Edgy speed tweaks. ... Any suggestions?
[10:39] <avagant> KMandla, www.ubuntuforums.org?
[10:39] <scamboy> notwist: click twice on volumme icon, go to file, point at the fist one, you will see choices..
[10:39] <Coffeegrinds> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30212/
[10:39] <Artemis3> avagant, the burning is too slow, i tried brasero and graveman in simulation as well, its burning too slow 8x discs at 1x or something
[10:39] <epsilon_> BAzfH CientificoLoco, seriously i dont know anything about shoutcast :). you can PLAY shoutcast with rhytmbox. there is an ubuntu howto here to use DJPlay for making it: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DJPlayWithShoutcastHowto .. or you can try using winamp with wine. nowadays wine is very cool runs lots of stuff fine.
[10:39] <Trae> I've got a borked display with X
[10:39] <roycebarber> Pastebin????? I'm all confused X.x
[10:39] <Trae> and doing ctrl+alt+backspace won't kill it
[10:39] <florides> i wanted to install a ftp server on ubuntu but i don't know much  about ftp servers
[10:39] <Trae> but I can ssh into the box
[10:39] <avagant> click on the link royce.
[10:39] <Coffeegrinds> click the link and read
[10:39] <BAzfH> notwist: then add an entry to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist a la blacklist modname
[10:39] <epsilon_> !pastebin > roycebarber
[10:40] <Trae> I've also tried: killall -9 X  and
[10:40] <notwist> BAzfH: exactly, the on board isnt working correctly so i dont want it active at all
[10:40] <Trae> killall -9 Xorg
[10:40] <BAzfH> epsilon_: i will give wine a try these days after a lot of years
[10:40] <Trae> neither works
[10:40] <jbroome> lollerskates ???!?!?!
[10:40] <Coffeegrinds> so i don;t flood the chane;
[10:40] <avagant> lollerskates. haha
[10:40] <BAzfH> hopefully i get some games running my girl likes to play
[10:40] <avagant> Coffeegrinds, please forgive me.
[10:40] <Trae>  and /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[10:40] <roycebarber> I dont get it
[10:40] <brentcool> join ##linux
[10:40] <epsilon_> BAzfH ok :D look, wine ran MAFIA fine for me!! (only the sound was choppy, but graphics were perfect)
[10:40] <avagant> royce, he's giving you information on how to fix flash.
[10:40] <avagant> first you click on the link, and read what comes up.
[10:40] <Artemis3> any idea what can be wrong with burning speed?
[10:40] <BAzfH> epsilon_: oh well i don't see trouble
[10:40] <roycebarber> Ok can you send me the link again X.x
[10:41] <Coffeegrinds> the only long term working solution
[10:41] <Coffeegrinds> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30212/
[10:41] <florides> what ftp server schould i use?
[10:41] <avagant> It's gonna say "dont use flash" isn't it?
[10:41] <BAzfH> epsilon_: really. the games she wants to run are... simple games
[10:41] <Coffeegrinds> and it's copy and pasty!\
[10:41] <notwist> BAzfH: how do i find out what the device is called?
[10:41] <epsilon_>  BAzfH CientificoLoco, look just try it. i can try it too. for you :D:D
[10:41] <Coffeegrinds> heheheh Damn should have thought of it. then again ..Ilike youtube
[10:41] <georgeb> Artemis3: maybe the dvd burner doesn't have DMA enabled
[10:41] <avagant> Oh sweet, I didn't do that yet.
[10:41] <BAzfH> notwist: google for the name of your soundcard ;))
[10:41] <roycebarber> Woah coffeegrings that looks complicated. I'll have to play with that and see if i can understand the lingo.
[10:42] <BAzfH> epsilon_: do you know zuma! ?
[10:42] <Artemis3> georgeb, how do i check that? hdparm?
[10:42] <Coffeegrinds> and it's copy and pasty!\ just copy anything sudo ... and oaste into terminal
[10:42] <avagant> I forgot about that, Coffee.
[10:42] <florides> anybody knows purftpd?
[10:42] <BAzfH> obviously this is the hardest one to emulate
[10:42] <notwist> BAzfH: well duh, i know what it's called, its nforce2 something, but how do i find out what to write
[10:42] <CientificoLoco> epsilon_, thaksn maybe it can help me. I will read it.
[10:42] <avagant> Thanks pal
[10:42] <georgeb> Artemis3: run sudo hdparm /dev/hda (or the burner's dev) and see if using_dma=1
[10:42] <andyb> !pastebin > andyb
[10:42] <BAzfH> notwist: blacklist nforce2
[10:42] <BAzfH> notwist: you really want to google for something like modprobe.d and blacklist
[10:43] <epsilon_>  BAzfH CientificoLoco, ok, look at the dj play homepage its quite professional :S
[10:43] <avagant> There I just finished.
[10:43] <avagant> Sweet mother of pearl how could I miss something like that.
[10:43] <TIger_IT> georgeb:  sorry.... I want to ask U something
[10:43] <Artemis3> georgeb, using_dma    =  0 (off) :(
[10:43] <TIger_IT> georgeb:  its about UDMA modes
[10:43] <TIger_IT> georgeb:  Can I ?
[10:43] <epsilon_>  BAzfH CientificoLoco, there is a DJPlay RPM file at sourceforge.
[10:43] <BAzfH> ok
[10:44] <barnetod> Anyone got time to help me, newbie question
[10:44] <epsilon_> BAzfH CientificoLoco, you MAY try to convert it to .deb
[10:44] <sizzam> ask away, barnetod
[10:44] <Artemis3> how to make hdparm permanently enable dma? init script?
[10:44] <barnetod> I am trying to install nvidia beta drivers
[10:44] <avagant> The way that webpage tells you to upgrade to edgy using the sources.list seems very hacky.
[10:44] <BAzfH> thanks epsilon_ .. will have a look at it if things are running
[10:44] <scamboy> !ask|barnetod
[10:44] <ubotu> barnetod: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:44] <TIger_IT> Artemis3: are you who knows about UDMAs ?
[10:44] <barnetod> I run the driver file the .run
[10:44] <georgeb> Artemis3: then run sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hda to enable dma
[10:44] <BAzfH> my fresh installed dappper is booting
[10:44] <barnetod> then get Error need to be root
[10:44] <Coffeegrinds> roycebarber:  it may look complicated and indeed the commands seem so.  but really all you gotta worry about is pasting each line one at a time into a terminal window and automagically it works
[10:44] <roycebarber> The pastebin thingy seemed to work, coffeegrinds... uhm.. Can you tell me what it did.....
[10:44] <barnetod> how do I switch to root or do I need to load up a real terminal?
[10:44] <Artemis3> georgeb, you think is it a good idea to do that in the middle of burning?
[10:44] <roycebarber> I pasted only the sudo things and i think it worked
[10:44] <weezl> hi :) anyone familiar with aixgl/beryl
[10:44] <epsilon_> BAzfH CientificoLoco, http://djplay.sourceforge.net/ss_large.jpg woot
[10:44] <barnetod> weezl thats what I am working on too :)
[10:45] <scamboy> !nvidia|barnetod
[10:45] <ubotu> barnetod: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[10:45] <georgeb> Artemis3: I don't know how to permanently enable it; the setting might be persistent
[10:45] <avagant> It creates a tmp socket for esd to go in so it doesn't interfer with alsa?
[10:45] <avagant> making flash no asplode?
[10:45] <weezl> heh so im not the only one with troubles here :D
[10:45] <BAzfH> ehh.. no i'm surprised.. installed dapper and there is upstart starting
[10:45] <noelferreira> hi people
[10:45] <notwist> BAzfH: is it really that clever to blacklist nforce since also the network runs through the motherboard? does it treat nforce2 like a wildcard?
[10:45] <BAzfH> s/no/now/
[10:45] <noelferreira> anyone with rt61 wireless driver working with eddy?
[10:45] <georgeb> Artemis3: i enabled it once in the middle of burning and everything went ok; but you might wait to finish burning; there might be different problems, from writer, etc
[10:45] <Coffeegrinds> any upgrade to flashh or firefox breaks one of thier ties to alsa. /esd (sound) indeed as avagant put it making flash asplode. so this just puts that link back
[10:46] <crazy_penguin> Artemis: to enable it permantly look in the /etc/hdparm.conf file and read man hdparm to know what to do
[10:46] <barnetod> nah weezl im going through driver issues
[10:46] <BAzfH> notwist: lol i thought nforce2 is the module name of your soundcard
[10:46] <Coffeegrinds> https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/29760
[10:46] <mabus> Anyone know how to get an i2o compatible raid controller to work with ubuntu? I could only find a howto for FC2, and I've never used it before. I'd really prefer to use ubuntu.
[10:46] <arbir> is reading the FAQ
[10:46] <avagant> sweet, maybe myspace will work now too.
[10:46] <weezl> i downloaded the packs and anything but after modifying the xorg.conf according to the install guide on the beryl forums and the gdm.conf-custom X wouldnt load up anymore
[10:46] <Coffeegrinds> almost halfway down the page .. look cfor danial carerra
[10:46] <georgeb> TIger_IT: I don't know very much about UDMA, but I had the same problem once
[10:46] <avagant> actually i don't know if even did the aoss thing for firefox 2.0.
[10:46] <notwist> BAzfH: nforce2 is nvidias motherboard technology, i just said the soundcards name is something with nforce2 in it
[10:46] <Coffeegrinds> daneil
[10:46] <Artemis3> georgeb,  nautilus is taking 60mins to burn what usually takes 8mins
[10:46] <avagant> DINNER TIME
[10:47] <Coffeegrinds> eat and be merry
[10:47] <mabus> Every distro calls the drive something else, which gives me problems with fstab/fdisk/grub.conf ... ranges from /dev/sda, to /dev/ida/c0d0p1, to /dev/ida/c0d0/part1, to /dev/i2o/hda1
[10:47] <Artemis3> georgeb, not just nautilus, also tried graveman and brasero
[10:47] <scamboy> avagant: its morning in asia
[10:47] <JamesBonz> hello
[10:47] <BAzfH> notwist: i repeat: you should google for some informations about your hardware and what modules are used for it
[10:47] <scamboy> james:helo
[10:47] <Artemis3> georgeb, i will enable it, i hope to not make a coaster ;)
[10:47] <BAzfH> notwist: i know that nforce2 chipset. but i don't know the module names
[10:48] <BAzfH> but it shouldn't be to bad to find out
[10:48] <scamboy> !nforce2
[10:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nforce2 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:48] <JamesBonz> Hello everyone, I came in here to ask about wireless.
[10:48] <georgeb> Artemis3: yes, it's about data transfer, without DMA everything is managed by the CPU, I bet you also have some high cpu usage :) DMA=direct memory transfer; the CPU won't be used very much in case of data transfer;
[10:48] <JamesBonz> im at my wits end
[10:48] <sizzam> JamesBonz: ask away, friend
[10:48] <Artemis3> georgeb, i just enabled it
[10:48] <georgeb> Artemis3: on the system I had this problem, without DMA, burning speed was about 1 MB/s; with DMA enabled 10-15 MB/s
[10:48] <Coffeegrinds> roycebarber:  I was beating myself silly looking ofr that answer for like 2 months.. could't view anything in flash.. that said it may still go on you once in a while.. but you won't lose sound .. it;ll just restart  Firefox / thats just an adobe thing
[10:48] <JamesBonz> well, ive read every single guide on "how-too" and nothing works
[10:49] <JamesBonz> ive ndiswrapper'd the driver
[10:49] <Artemis3> georgeb, it seems to be going a little faster already
[10:49] <JamesBonz> but in the 'wireless network drivers" page it says the driver is present, but not the hardware
[10:49] <BAzfH> hmm. ah
[10:49] <JamesBonz> btw, im on an emachine m6809 with the broadcom BCMWL5
[10:50] <Artemis3> georgeb, i noticed the hard disks have dma enabled, how come the dvdr does not? where does the system configure that?
[10:50] <maddog39> hallo!
[10:50] <BAzfH> argg
[10:50] <epsilon_> BAzfH CientificoLoco, wine works well and plays mp3. (classic skin)

[10:50] <BAzfH> now my usbdisk is not running any more
[10:50] <georgeb> Artemis3: the writer on which I tried enablein DMA on the fly was a Asus P2S, and it worked; but during enabling DMA I saw that the burning speed went to 0 for half a minute or so
[10:50] <crazy_penguin> Artemis: look at the /etc/hdparm.conf file
[10:50] <BAzfH> epsilon_, cool#

[10:56] <georgeb> roycebarber: it emulates a whole system; you can create a virtual machine and install windows in it; you'll have a full windows system
[10:56] <arbir> welcome to ubuntu rappermas
[10:56] <Rappermas> which is unfortunate because the engine is quite capable

[10:57] <Rappermas> however, google isn't very helpful
[10:57] <roycebarber> Yeah the thing is, mr ubotu bot... wine just doesnt do what i need it to. wine is horribly awful at running windows programs, and i know not how to make it work anyway. :)

[11:00] <Rappermas> yes, the graphics are amazing

[11:00] <Rappermas> running OpenGL
[11:00] <Rappermas> but since I switched Ubuntu I can't program anymore
[11:00] <arbir> it installed perfectly in ubuntu breezy and now in edgy its crapping out

[11:01] <arbir> i have tried all the gstreamer plugins.. including the mad one
[11:01] <Rappermas> bobbyd: nehe is windows, besides, I know way more about OpenGL than that tutorial (but it did help!)
[11:01] <arbir> but i cannot use mp3 on either rhythm box
[11:01] <arbir> or the video player

[11:02] <effie_jayx> arbir... ehat about xine
[11:02] <bobbyd> Rappermas, also, install apt-file (sudo apt-get install apt-file) then do "apt-file search glu.h"

[11:02] <bobbyd> Rappermas, nope

[11:03] <jrib> SupremacyGnu: unrar the first one
[11:03] <effie_jayx> arbir: try totem-xine

[11:03] <Rappermas> bobbyd: how come I never noticed?
[11:03] <Arwen> SupremacyGnu: with rar
[11:03] <effie_jayx> with libxine-extracodecs
[11:03] <bobbyd> Rappermas, you never looked?
[11:03] <Rappermas> lol
[11:03] <Arwen> they're split rar files
[11:03] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, ah ok
[11:03] <arbir> hold on effie_jayx.. let me do a search on this synaptic
[11:03] <effie_jayx> ok
[11:03] <Stonekeeper> SupremacyGnu: they are split rar files
[11:03] <^pixel__> sometimes I make an archive of many files! But when I Extract the file, it seems that files are missing from it!  Is this a bug?
[11:03] <Rappermas> bobbyd: i looked...but...wow, maybe i forgot to get sleep or something
[11:03] <^pixel__> anyone know pls?
[11:04] <sethk> Arwen, that's caused by not having autoconf itself installed.  what are you building from source?
[11:04] <bobbyd> Rappermas, anyway, do what I said and you'll find the package containing glu.h
[11:04] <Tonren> Hey guys, when I build stuff from source, should I set the --prefix to /usr/local?
[11:04] <idiat> I HAVE TO GO NOW

[11:04] <Stonekeeper> can someone please help me get past my edgy live cd error? I'm *desperate* to get it installed....
[11:04] <effie_jayx> ok
[11:04] <arbir> lets see if it works or not
[11:04] <effie_jayx> you need to install
[11:04] <ale[x] > what pkgs do i need to play xvid?
[11:04] <andyb> ^pixel__: how areyou creating the archive? what type?
[11:04] <arbir> and my geforce go 6800 is also creating issues
[11:04] <Arwen> sethk: yea, there
[11:04] <bobbyd> Stonekeeper, what's the error?
[11:04] <arbir> worked so perfectly on breezy :(
[11:04] <sizzam> Stonekeeper: what error are you getting?
[11:04] <yourself_myself> is there anything wrong with the default kernel image on edgy and SMP? I have a pentium D and get "WARNING: NR_CPUS limit of 1 reached.  Processor ignored." kernel messages....
[11:04] <Arwen> there's no precompiled*

[11:04] <Rappermas> bobbyd: it's a broken package
[11:05] <bobbyd> Stonekeeper, take out your sound card
[11:05] <arbir> ok wait effie_jayx let me try that too as well
[11:05] <sethk> Tonren, that's the default.  If you want to cover up stuff installed by the package manager, you use prefix=/usr
[11:05] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, please could you give me the command? new linux user... is it: unrar <filename> /path/to/directory?
[11:05] <Stonekeeper> bobbyd: just during install?

[11:05] <effie_jayx> arbir ajam...
[11:05] <Stonekeeper> SupremacyGnu: guess so. Install unrar if you need "apt-get install unrar"
[11:05] <epsilon_> BAzfH shall i try to set up djplay tomorrow?
[11:05] <arbir> whats ajam ?
[11:05] <sethk> Arwen, yes, there's a package for it
[11:05] <Stonekeeper> bobbyd: I need this card to do music
[11:05] <Rappermas> wow, so I can't do OpenGL programming on Ubuntu is basically what this tells me
[11:06] <Tonren> sethk: Hmm... That usually happens on the configure step, right?  What if this app uses autogen.sh?
[11:06] <Stonekeeper> tit's a broken kernel module I'm sure
[11:06] <Tonren> sethk: The documentation suggest ~/.local/
[11:06] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, doesn't seem to work. It want a flag
[11:06] <sethk> Tonren, after autogen, then you run configure
[11:06] <Rappermas> COpenGLDriver.h:38:21: error: GL/glu.h: No such file or directory
[11:06] <sethk> Tonren, so nothing changes, really
[11:06] <Stonekeeper> SupremacyGnu: unrar -h or man unrar
[11:06] <Arwen> why isn't autoconf part of build-essential, anyway?

[11:06] <SB|nblracer> jrib i cant find how to uninstall, but is it worth it to reinstall it through the packetmanger
[11:06] <Stonekeeper> bobbyd: Irony is it's a delta m-audio
[11:06] <Tonren> sethk: Oh, I see.  So.. I'm building gmpc from SVN.  I ought to use /usr, then.
[11:07] <bobbyd> Stonekeeper, hmm
[11:07] <Stonekeeper> bobbyd: also, how do you fix the live cd? ;)
[11:07] <Rappermas> arbir: does "nvidia-settings" work?
[11:07] <fishsticks> so i have a silly question
[11:07] <sethk> Tonren, up to you.  I generally use /usr/local, and then put /usr/local/bin in my path before /usr/bin.  That way, if I want to go back to using the package manager version, I don't have any real difficulties
[11:07] <arbir> i dont even see it in my menu Rappermas
[11:07] <jrib> SB|nblracer: if it is "worth it", is up to you.  The main advanatages are you will get security updates automatically
[11:07] <bobbyd> Stonekeeper, the devs will fix it and change the CD image
[11:07] <Rappermas> try commandline arbir

[11:07] <Arwen> I notice that reiser4progs are in edgy - is reiser4 safe to use then?
[11:07] <Stonekeeper> bobbyd: it's broken my dapper too so I'm stuck on winblows :(
[11:07] <sethk> Tonren, but using prefix=/usr simplifies things.  up to you.
[11:07] <BAzfH> epsilon_: you don't need too.. i will as soon as my system is up and running#

[11:08] <Arwen> or is there some reason I want to avoid them (other than the morbid factor)?
[11:08] <sethk> Arwen, I don't believe so, at least it's not proven safe yet.  I would wait.
[11:08] <Danny> I need help any one here got AIM and can help me with bluetooth
[11:08] <arbir> yes i did effie_jayx
[11:08] <epsilon_> BAzfH okay. im happy to help you :)
[11:08] <Justy-> !cpufreq
[11:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cpufreq - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:08] <Arwen> sethk: hmm, kinda ironic that they're in a stable release
[11:08] <Justy-> !cpu
[11:08] <yourself_myself> is there any special package i need to install for SMP on edgy?
[11:08] <ubotu> cpu: a console based LDAP user management tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.4.3-8 (edgy), package size 137 kB, installed size 432 kB
[11:08] <arbir> i am following the FAQ from the lnk on the top of this IRC
[11:08] <jrib> !ask | Danny
[11:08] <ubotu> Danny: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
=== Echtor2oo3`wow is now known as Echtor2oo3
[11:08] <BAzfH> thank ya, epsilon_
[11:08] <arbir> only when it did not work out, did i post my question here
[11:08] <Danny> k
[11:08] <Tonren> sethk: Oh.  /usr/local/bin is already before /usr/bin.  I'll just use /usr/local, then
[11:09] <epsilon_> BAzfH hey ubotu says that there is a djplay package
[11:09] <Stonekeeper> anyone upgraded to edgy via "update-manager -c" or is it better to reinstall?
[11:09] <epsilon_> !djplay > BAzfH
[11:09] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, no sorry, can't seem to make it work... sorry for being so noobish, but this is my first time trying to unpack this kind of files
[11:09] <BAzfH> shit
[11:09] <Danny> I need bluetooth help  with a wifi bt card  based on a rail link chipset
[11:09] <Stonekeeper> SupremacyGnu: try "unrar -x <name of file>.r00"
[11:09] <scamboy> !bluetooth|danny
[11:09] <ubotu> danny: For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
[11:09] <Stonekeeper> or rar -x
[11:09] <Danny> thanks
[11:09] <sethk> Arwen, they've claimed stability for years.  but they claimed all the problems were in version 1, and version 2 was perfect.  then they claimed all the problems were in v2, and v3 was perfect.  then they claimed all the problems were because of a kernel issue.  then they (now) claim that all the problems were in v3, and v4 is perfect.  I'll wait several months before believing it
[11:09] <arbir> Stonekeeper: its recommended to have a fresh install
[11:09] <arbir> its always cleaner
[11:09] <epsilon_> BAzfH ahhhham!! :D so just install it. bah i dont bother you any more :)
[11:10] <BAzfH> it's bad to have a  in your wlan secret if your system does not have correct locales
[11:10] <Stonekeeper> crap. I can't :( i was hoping to upgrade from an earlier dapper kernel (if it'll work)
[11:10] <sethk> Arwen, plus, there is really no advantage to reiser in real life situations, so why take a risk, no matter how small?
[11:10] <BAzfH> epsilon_, you dont bother me
[11:10] <Justy-> I cannot install cpufreq-powersave package, is it about my sources.list? : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30218/
[11:10] <arbir> now, my movie player plays mp3 but not the rhythmbox player
[11:10] <BAzfH> epsilon_, i'm just a bit nervous cause my wlan sucks my ass
[11:10] <Tonren> Whoa... why is the automake in the repos so OLD?
[11:10] <Arwen> sethk: true (although I do use XFS - big risk there)
[11:10] <T3tr1s_M4n> !ask I have 3 partitions on my HD, one FAT32 and 2 NTFS. The Fat32 and one of the NTFS are primary; the other is logical (extended). I'm trying to install ubuntu on FAT32, but I don't know how to. What should I do?
[11:10] <epsilon_> BAzfH its the latest version
[11:10] <Stonekeeper> ok, is there a way to NOT install HDs during a live cd install?
[11:10] <epsilon_> BAzfH i dont know that :(
[11:10] <Arwen> but reiser seems to have a shaky future anyway
[11:10] <Stonekeeper> sound cards... :/
[11:10] <BAzfH> dont worry
[11:11] <arbir> is there a special plugin for rhythmbox player ?
[11:11] <sethk> Arwen, I don't believe so.  xfs is perhaps not that popular in linux, but has lots of miles on it in other UNIX environments
[11:11] <andyb> Stonekeeper: I didn't use update-manager, but i _have_ upgraded several dapper boxes to edgy successfully. Seems to work fine.
[11:11] <Tonren> They're up to 1.9, and the repos have 1.4
[11:11] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, ah, it was unrar e <filename>
[11:11] <SupremacyGnu> Stonekeeper, thanks
[11:11] <Stonekeeper> SupremacyGnu: well done for working it out
[11:11] <Stonekeeper> andyb: what command?
[11:11] <T3tr1s_M4n> scamboy I have 3 partitions on my HD, one FAT32 and 2 NTFS. The Fat32 and one of the NTFS are primary; the other is logical (extended). I'm trying to install ubuntu on FAT32, but I don't know how to. What should I do?
[11:11] <Arwen> sethk: perhaps.. in retrospect, I think the only reason I used XFS was I didn't know to tune2fs -m 0, lol
[11:11] <BAzfH> hmm.. how do i get german locales running right without network connection? ;o)
[11:12] <Arwen> is it possible to resize a partition to occupy preceding free space?
[11:12] <sethk> Arwen, but staying with ext3 is probably the best route for most users
[11:12] <sethk> Arwen, sure
[11:12] <^pixel__> anders: double clicking Nautilus!  any ideas?
[11:12] <sethk> Arwen, you just delete it, and create a new one
[11:12] <asasasdad> hey
[11:12] <^pixel__> anders: I mean, right click,
[11:12] <Arwen> sethk: lol... it's my boot partition, doesn't work that way
[11:12] <^pixel__> anders: I mean, right click, and then "create Archive"
[11:12] <asasasdad> hey
[11:12] <^pixel__> anders: any ideas?
[11:12] <sethk> Arwen, you said empty partition
[11:12] <k31th> I have no sound. Its detected my card but doesnt play nothing.
[11:12] <Rappermas> http://pastebin.ca/238230
[11:13] <^pixel__> andyb: i mean you
[11:13] <asasasdad> f!ck
[11:13] <Rappermas> that's what i get
[11:13] <p0ok> can anyone point me to some kind of documentation on installing a new soundcard?  I can't seem to get mine recognized.
[11:13] <Rappermas> when i try to tmake
[11:13] <sethk> Arwen, there are programs to resize ext3, but back up before yo use one
[11:13] <Rappermas> make*
[11:13] <arbir> anybody can get mp3's to play on their rhythmbox player ?
[11:13] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk I have 3 partitions on my HD, one FAT32 and 2 NTFS. The Fat32 and one of the NTFS are primary; the other is logical (extended). I'm trying to install ubuntu on FAT32, but I don't know how to. What should I do?
[11:13] <Arwen> sethk: I asked if you could expand a partition to grow on preceding space
[11:13] <^pixel__> k31th: not my problem
[11:13] <k31th> Worked great ina ll ther versions of ubuntu // its a soundblaster 24bit audigy2
[11:13] <Stonekeeper> I can't believe the error that's stopping me installing edgy is a fix for a cardbus problem o_O : https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2006-July/000959.html
[11:13] <BAzfH> hmm.. i could imagine i know the reason why my system locked up when doing ifup with rt61 driver
[11:13] <andyb> Stonekeeper: A bit clumsy (and probably not optimal) but I changed my sources.list and then used apt-get dist-upgrade a couple of times, and also aptitude dist-upgrade, and kept an eye on the packages being installed.
[11:13] <jda487> hey there, i am getting an Error 2 when trying to compile ndiswrapper on 6.06, any suggestions?
[11:13] <k31th> ^pixel__: STFU
[11:13] <Arwen> gparted didn't like it when I tried that (greyed out)
[11:13] <sethk> Arwen, yes, in principle, you can
[11:13] <BAzfH> could be damaged handling of keys when specifying it is a hex key but in real it is ascii
[11:13] <Arwen> in principle?
[11:13] <k31th> Stonekeeper: dude!
[11:13] <Stonekeeper> k31th: !!!
[11:14] <Stonekeeper> k31th: mate, got a nightmare here
[11:14] <k31th> Fancey bumping into you on irc...
[11:14] <Stonekeeper> PM
[11:14] <k31th> kk.
[11:14] <Rappermas> i just installed X11 development files, but I still get this because of a missing glu.h :     http://pastebin.ca/238230
[11:14] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, if you use manual partitioning, you can do it, but are you sure you want to install onto FAT?  FAT has no permissions capabilities.
[11:14] <andyb> ^pixel__: Say again - how did you _create_ the archive? And what type of archive file?
[11:14] <arbir> Stonekeeper:  you from australia ?
[11:14] <tictacaddict> hello, I'm trying to make a script execute with root privileges by setting the suid bit but it's not doing what I expected
[11:14] <arbir> from down under ?
[11:14] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk so in which kind of partition can i install it?
[11:14] <SB|nblracer> jrib one last thing, in the manger it says the latest version is 2.0.1 when realy there at 2.2. is there a way to add what i have installed to pack. manger
[11:15] <Stonekeeper> arbir: heh
[11:15] <Stonekeeper> arbir: no
[11:15] <Stonekeeper> arbir: I'm from the country they drew with today
[11:15] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, you can install onto any file system.  I'm not saying you can't install onto FAT, just that it may not be a good idea.
[11:15] <jrib> SB|nblracer: no, not from the ubuntu repositories
[11:15] <arbir> i am not following scores today
[11:15] <Arwen> :-( I can't seem to find CDRWs faster than 4x...
[11:15] <andyb> ^pixel__: OK - see your anser now - make sure you spell the name right!
[11:15] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, install onto ext3.  there are ext3 drivers available for windows.
[11:15] <p0ok> can anyone point me to some kind of documentation on installing a new soundcard?  I can't seem to get mine recognized.
[11:15] <arbir> Maite .. can you get mp3 working on your rhythmbox player ?
[11:15] <sizzam> arbir: i think you have to install gstreamer0.8-mad package to get mp3's playing in rhytmbox
[11:16] <Stonekeeper> !bug report
[11:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bug report - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:16] <arbir> sizzam: I HAVE installed mad package
[11:16] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk can i create a partition ext3 via Partition Magic (in windows) then installing ubuntu there?
[11:16] <andyb> ^pixel__: have you tried extracting the archive from the command line - see if the files made it in successfully?
[11:16] <arbir> like i said, i did everything on the FAQ before posting my question here
[11:16] <welly> hey all.. if i run dpkg --purge apache2 how come apache2 still exists?
[11:16] <p0ok> ok how about this, are there any channels around here where I can get some help on replacing a soundcard?
[11:17] <sethk> welly, metaphysics is kind of off topic  :)
[11:17] <andyb> ^pixel__: I still find the GUI based archive manager a little unreliable and prefer the command line for creating and extracting tarballs etc.
[11:17] <welly> sethk: lol perhaps! but it's a bit odd
[11:17] <arbir> yep gstreamer0.8-mad is installed
[11:17] <sethk> welly, I think that purge, there, is related to package database, not the software itself.
[11:17] <welly> sethk: ok fair enough
[11:17] <arbir> and still my rhythymbox refuses to play mp3
[11:17] <Arwen> arbir: um, the current version of gstreamer is .10
[11:18] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk can i create a partition ext3 via Partition Magic (in windows) then installing ubuntu there?
[11:18] <elementz> need help with gstreamer output - anybody willing to help pls msg me
[11:18] <Rappermas> why is it I can't install libglu1-mesa-dev
[11:18] <Rappermas> with apt
[11:18] <Rappermas> ???
[11:18] <jrib> !ask | elementz
[11:18] <ubotu> elementz: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:18] <BAzfH> hm
[11:18] <Grife> can I play quake 3 on amd64?
[11:18] <BAzfH> wlan card seems to work a bit better now
[11:18] <arbir> Arwen: so which package should i install ?
[11:18] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, I don't think partition magic will do ext3.  but you can use partition magic to create a partition of _any_ type, and then in linux use fdisk to change the type to whatever you want to use
[11:18] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, I'm assuming you are using partition magic to make space for ubuntu
[11:18] <KriS|Lappy> Anybody had any luck with intel-hda soundcards (ALC660) with any Ubuntu version? I can't get it to work :(
[11:19] <BAzfH> at least it does sent and receive (even though not connect the wlan)
[11:19] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, so make space with any partition type at all.  as long as there is space, you are in good shape.
[11:19] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk ok.... i understood, thanks!
[11:19] <Tonren> So guys, I updated to Edgy, and now my send/block/add/etc. buttons in Gaim aren't showing up anymore
[11:19] <elementz> ok, how do i install gstreamer plugins
[11:19] <elementz> ?
[11:19] <BAzfH> hm lets try without wep/wpa
[11:19] <T3tr1s_M4n> sethk just one more question: does the partition need to be logical or primary?
[11:19] <Arwen> arbir: try gstreamer0.10-ugly
[11:19] <tictacaddict> Tonren you have Gaim2.0 now
[11:19] <jrib> welly: it still says the apache2 package is installed?  Or do you just still have apache2 stuff?
[11:19] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, makes no different to linux
[11:19] <arbir> ok let me see
[11:19] <T3tr1s_M4n> thankyou sethk
[11:20] <welly> jrib: well the package has gone but the files still exist
[11:20] <sethk> T3tr1s_M4n, primary is better, if there is an available primary partition, but secondary is no problem
[11:20] <tictacaddict> Tonren: not sure of the exact options you want but it's layed out a little different
[11:20] <jrib> welly: apache2 probably depends on other apache2 packages that actually pull in that stuff you see
[11:20] <welly> jrib: ah fair enough
=== joel is now known as yoink
[11:20] <arbir> installing the ugly set
[11:20] <welly> i'll try not to worry too much about it
[11:20] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[11:20] <tuxtheslacker> is there a weather widget for gnome?
[11:21] <elementz> ok, i'll try to explain my prob again:
[11:21] <Tonren> tictacaddict: The "Send" button is pretty basic.  I feel like something weird is going on.
[11:21] <jrib> welly: if you use aptitude to install and remove, it should handle that scenario better (automatically removes unneeded deps)
[11:21] <tuxtheslacker> like there is for mac osx?
[11:21] <Grife> Arwen, speaking of which..
[11:21] <arbir> arbir was a fan of winamp and XMMS does not give those skins which winamp does
[11:21] <Flosoft> hey
[11:21] <Grife> how can I change the default nideo player?
[11:21] <welly> jrib: oh this is on a server i don't have access to other than through ssh
[11:21] <tuxtheslacker> I need a gnome version because I HATE KDE....
[11:21] <savvas> !firewall
[11:21] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[11:21] <Flosoft> I wanted to know if the package of pureftpd in dapper is compiled with largefile support
[11:21] <jrib> welly: aptitude runs on the command line
[11:21] <welly> jrib: oh  right!
[11:21] <elementz> while importing mp3s to rhythmbox, i get an error that i don't have the gstreamer plugs installed
[11:21] <p0ok> ok, how about this...I have an m-audio delta 1010lt soundcard that is not recognized, and I cant figure it out.  Is there documentation somewhere for this?
[11:21] <arbir> wow!
[11:21] <arbir> Ugly worked
[11:22] <jrib> tuxtheslacker: there is a panel applet.  There is also a gdesklet
[11:22] <morghanphoenix> Aybody know why my speakers would put out a really obnoxious buzzing noise when I'm trying to watch a movie?
[11:22] <arbir> i spent 3 hrs googling
[11:22] <Arwen> Grife: just right-click on your media files and change the app from the list in "open with"
[11:22] <arbir> and here i get it going in 5 mins
[11:22] <Arwen> oh yea... go to properties first
[11:22] <tuxtheslacker> jrib, what is gdesklet?
[11:22] <tictacaddict> Tonren: well, I just use the enter key to send messages.  I'm using gaim in edgy right now and I don't have a send button.  I don't think it's out of the ordinary.  there might be a way to show it though
[11:22] <savvas> is psybnc still having problems with 2.6 kernels?
[11:22] <Arwen> mm... winmodems are ugly..
[11:22] <sethk> p0ok, yes
[11:22] <avagant> gdesklets never worked for me right, be advised.
[11:22] <sethk> p0ok, uses module snd-ice1712
[11:22] <scamboy> hi sethk
[11:23] <jrib> tuxtheslacker: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDesklets
[11:23] <Grife> ok thanks. I'm goddamn impressed with ubuntu, used linux last time 3 years ago! :D
[11:23] <savvas> Arwen: their prefix betrays their description :p
[11:23] <morghanphoenix> it's the noise like my speakers are turned up all the way, but they're down low.
[11:23] <sethk> scamboy, hello
[11:23] <Tonren> tictacaddict: But what about the block button, add button, warn button, etc?  I don't even see an option anywhere to bring 'em back.
[11:23] <sethk> p0ok, do insmod of snd-ice1712.  then try to configure your sound
[11:23] <p0ok> oh sweet, sethk
[11:23] <scamboy> grife: go go go
[11:23] <p0ok> thanks!
[11:23] <p0ok> thats just the info I needed, much obliged
[11:23] <arbir> can anybody play the beethoven.com radiostation ?
[11:23] <jrib> tuxtheslacker: you can even see the weather one in the screenshot there
[11:23] <sethk> p0ok, probably better to use modprobe, not insmod.
[11:23] <avagant> I'm alright with Ubuntu, we're not bff's yet.
[11:23] <Grife> these systems have come a long way..
[11:23] <avagant> It has a long way to go.
[11:23] <p0ok> right, got that
[11:23] <p0ok> I just didnt know what module I should be using
[11:24] <scamboy> arbir: yes on wmP:-P
[11:24] <scamboy> eheheeeee
[11:24] <sethk> p0ok, k
[11:24] <BAzfH> hmm
[11:24] <arbir> on i mean on rhythmboxx :)
[11:24] <tictacaddict> Tonren: they are under the Conversation menu in the im window
[11:24] <scamboy> haven tried
[11:24] <jrib> tuxtheslacker: to install them you would just install the 'gdesklets' package from universe, using synaptic for example
=== das-q_ is now known as das-q
[11:24] <rusty64bit> hey anybody here can help with aiglx on edgy
[11:25] <avagant> gdesklets made my computer lag, and then nothing ever showed up.
[11:25] <p0ok> sethk: I don't seem to have that module on my system, is there a place I can grab it?
[11:25] <tuxtheslacker> jrib, I am installing gdesklets now... how would I go about adding and removing widgets?
[11:25] <avagant> don't you just click on it?
[11:25] <jrib> tuxtheslacker: I don't really use it, but you should get a menu item somewhere
[11:25] <avagant> or right click or something of the likes?
[11:25] <Tonren> tictacaddict: Yeah, but the buttons are still gone.  :\
[11:25] <tuxtheslacker> jrib, oh okay :-)
[11:25] <sethk> p0ok, I just rebuild the kernel with whatever modules I need.  Do you know how to do that?
[11:25] <avagant> I think if i'm not mistaken you right click on it.
[11:25] <p0ok> yeah, I just wanted to avoid it...:)
[11:25] <p0ok> but I can certainly do it
[11:25] <tuxtheslacker> that'll be just lovely then, thanks!
=== cricht0ff is now known as crichton
[11:26] <avagant> Well don't quote me on that.
[11:26] <p0ok> theres no dynamically loadable possibility?
[11:26] <avagant> I haven't used them in weeks.
=== crichton is now known as cricht0n
[11:26] <sethk> p0ok, might be, I don't know where to download it.  let me see if the file appears in any package
[11:26] <p0ok> ok, im looking too, thanks
[11:26] <avagant> I had them for about 20 minutes, but they didn't show up on my screen and when they did i couldn't figure out how to get (for instance the weather one) to go to the right place, it kept throwing an error message.
[11:27] <arbir> *no*
[11:27] <arbir> test
[11:27] <arbir> test
[11:27] <sethk> p0ok, I see it in kernel 2.6.12-9
[11:27] <avagant> And considering all of everything else I have on my computer, 10gb's doesn't go very far.
[11:27] <tictacaddict> Tonren: can't deny that.  I don't know a way to bring them back except maybe installing gaim1.5
[11:27] <sethk> p0ok, should be in any later kernel version also.  are you sure you don't already have it?
[11:27] <Tonren> tictacaddict: Eh, I'll live
[11:27] <p0ok> pretty sure, it wouldnt load, looked in the source tree
[11:27] <p0ok> im running the latest edgy, 2.6.10 or something
[11:28] <avagant> gaim 2.0 is just gaim  but now they actually make the little tabs readable.
[11:28] <p0ok> oh wait
[11:28] <p0ok> found it!
[11:28] <p0ok> sweet, thanks
[11:28] <sethk> p0ok, my search won't find it, because I'm not on edgy yet on this box.  but it would be very strange for them to take it out.
[11:28] <sethk> p0ok, ok, good.
[11:28] <progek> can anyone help me with a tomcat question? I installed it and started it. It's running but localhost:8080 brings up a blank page.
[11:28] <avagant> And it isn't an ugly box looking thing.
[11:28] <p0ok> cd /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/kernel/sound/pci/ice1712/
[11:28] <p0ok> ack
[11:28] <avagant> !tomcat
[11:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tomcat - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:29] <avagant> you mean tomboy?
[11:29] <avagant> !tomboy
[11:29] <ubotu> tomboy: desktop note taking program using Wiki style links. In component main, is optional. Version 0.4.1-0ubuntu3 (edgy), package size 413 kB, installed size 2416 kB
[11:29] <jmspeex> crimsun: thanks for helping get the Speex package fixed.
[11:29] <aridese> hello, im having trouble connecting to the internet with dapper -- i get a "network is unreachable" when i try to ping
[11:29] <aridese> is it a routing issue?
[11:29] <avagant> how do you even use tomboy?
[11:29] <tictacaddict> so, anyone think they could help me get suid working with a script?
[11:29] <progek> no, tomcat for servlets and JSPs, thanks, I will look into that link
[11:29] <IceTox> do you guys know of any linux supported version of msn that is just as good as MSN Messenger?
[11:29] <avagant> Oh, well that might not be the right one.
[11:29] <aridese> IceTox: there isn't one
[11:29] <sethk> tictacaddict, what is happening when you run the script?
[11:29] <aridese> IceTox: if you want windows apps, use windows
[11:29] <avagant> Or wine.
[11:29] <savvas> arbir: beethoven.com radio station plays ok here :)
[11:30] <aridese> avagant: if it works
[11:30] <sizzam> IceTox: GAIM has MSN support, not sure what features it lacks
[11:30] <avagant> I'm scared, I wanna download music but I'm afraid if I download the music and try to play it and something else I'll get those messages about my soundcard.
[11:30] <IceTox> thanks.. I've tried wine with quite bad results :)
[11:30] <Byan> how do you upgrade from dapper to edgy?
[11:30] <avagant> And then I'll be tempted to tamper with something.
[11:30] <aridese> IceTox: back to windows it is
[11:30] <savvas> !edgy
[11:30] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[11:30] <avagant> Byan: gksu "update-manager -c"
[11:31] <sizzam> aridese: be nice ;-)
[11:31] <IceTox> sizzam: well, I'll try it out.. Haven't used it for years now as I've been stuck with amsn.. But anyway, I just like the way windows MSN messenger handles the webcam sessions and this cute little option for personal messages :)
[11:31] <avagant> yah wine didn't work for me at all, i couldn't get aim to work, i couldn't download soulseek, really all i used was mirc and internet explorer
[11:31] <Byan> avagant: what's gksu?
[11:31] <tictacaddict> sethk: the same thing happens whether it is suid or not: I get permission denied for some commands in the script. it works fine if I use sudo
[11:31] <IceTox> aridese: geesh. it must be hard to be that simple minded :) Are you always this grumpy?
[11:31] <aridese> IceTox: MSN Gaaim support is nothing more than text
[11:31] <sizzam> IceTox: yea, im not sure about gaim with webcams.  good luck
[11:31] <Arwen> Byan: a frontend for su
[11:31] <savvas> IceTox: if you need msn messenger, try amsn: sudo apt-get install amsn
[11:31] <avagant> Byan I don't know the literal definition, but it's good?
[11:31] <georgy> arbir : beethoven.com plays well
[11:32] <IceTox> thanks sizzam
[11:32] <aridese> IceTox: nah, just saving you some trouble
[11:32] <avagant> but yah byan do it that way.
[11:32] <sethk> tictacaddict, hmm.  I'd run it under strace, see if it is trying to change the effective user ID.
[11:32] <avagant> It's probably the safest way to do it.
[11:32] <Byan> avagant: is it gonna work without X?
[11:32] <Flosoft> I wanted to know if the package of pureftpd in dapper is compiled with largefile support
[11:32] <avagant> Without X? What do you mean?
[11:32] <Byan> avagant: an X server, it's headless
[11:32] <IceTox> lol.. thanks than.. lol I like to be stumbling in the dark a little trying to figure out howto make my Ubuntu desktop computer to work its best :)
[11:32] <avagant> Hmm.
[11:32] <avagant> Do you have access to a terminal?
[11:32] <tictacaddict> sethk: sounds like a start.  how do I use strace, though?  strace command?
[11:32] <DanSchnell> Does Anyone have any idea why i can't resize my partition with the alternate installer?
[11:33] <Byan> yeah.., I'm using one right now
[11:33] <sethk> tictacaddict, right
[11:33] <avagant> I think there's a tutorial for that.
[11:33] <daywalker2002ve> anybody know how to do a network bridge
[11:33] <daywalker2002ve> ???
[11:33] <sethk> tictacaddict, user -o whatever to get the stuff into a file rather than standard out
[11:33] <avagant> you might have better luck with reading the forums or the wiki.
[11:33] <avagant> But the way I did it was gksu "update-manager -c"
[11:33] <avagant> Be advised, it isn't a short install.
[11:33] <avagant> Haha
=== Arwen is now known as anon32
[11:34] <avagant> this morning.
[11:34] <shannon> The broadcom page says I need to install the 2.6.17-7 kernel for 64-bit edgy, but I seem to have 2.6.17-10, and I don't see the -7 one in the repository, will broadcom still work?
[11:34] <Byan> avagant: couldn't be too bad.., mine takes like 20 minutes to install dapper..
[11:34] <Rappermas> yeah, i just confirmed a long-time theory of mine--the smart package manager pretty much owns apt
[11:34] <Byan> does it take longer to update?
[11:34] <avagant> I honestly don't know.
[11:34] <Byan> hmm
[11:34] <Byan> kk
[11:34] <anon32> Rappermas: but the smart one isn't verbose enough..
[11:34] <andyb> Byan: You can dio it by changing your sources.list filew to edgy and then using apt-get dist-upgrade. I'ts a little more involved than that (you may need to run it twice and do a few other things) but basically it works.
[11:35] <tictacaddict> sethk: if it was trying to change the effective user id, what would I see in the output?
[11:35] <georgeb> !bridge-utils | daywalker2002ve
[11:35] <ubotu> bridge-utils: Utilities for configuring the Linux ethernet bridge. In component main, is optional. Version 1.1-1 (edgy), package size 27 kB, installed size 148 kB
[11:35] <Rappermas> anon32: but it worked just now when apt was croaking and dying
[11:35] <avagant> andyb: I heard that way is kinda hacky.
[11:35] <sethk> tictacaddict, let me check ...
[11:35] <Rappermas> and now i can keep doing my development work
[11:35] <scifix>  any idea how u get rid of the black background that seems to appear when i open a image in another app that ive made in gimp. it even occurs if background layer is transparent! help!
[11:35] <anon32> Rappermas: apt is a backend... it does what you tell it to do
[11:35] <avagant> Byan: If it takes you 20 minutes to install Dapper it shouldn't take you that long to get Edgy.
[11:35] <anon32> for special circumstances, there's special scripts
[11:35] <edgarin> Hi to all people I have a problem with the update of my dapper to Edgy the problem is the follow: When my system boot the partition swap is not mounted and when I have XGL the system is down! howto activate the partition of swap?
[11:35] <Rappermas> i'm just saying that smart algorithms are better
[11:35] <avagant> It takes me like 1:30 hours to do it.
[11:35] <DanSchnell> Does Anyone have any idea why i can't resize my partition with the alternate installer?
[11:35] <edgarin> I test swapon /dev/hda5 but don't work
[11:35] <avagant> Errr
[11:35] <edgarin> any ideas?
[11:36] <abnerian> Hey, what's a good VNC viewer for Ubuntu?
[11:36] <avagant> But yah, so far so good with edgy.
[11:36] <abnerian> To view a windows PC.
[11:36] <andyb> avagant: A little maybe - but I'm used to apt so I'm comfortable doing it that way,. Always happiest at the command line :) Worked for me on several boxes anyway.
[11:36] <novato_br> hi, ubuntu's dudes
[11:36] <abnerian> Heya.
[11:36] <anon32> oh yea - trying to hibernate gets me a "can't initiate device 00:06" error and then it deletes my swap partition
[11:36] <avagant> andyb, yah i guess it's all about peoples setups and what not.
[11:36] <anon32> help?
[11:36] <georgeb> daywalker2002ve: use bridge-utils and look it up on the net; here's a link but I'm not sure how up to date it is: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BRIDGE-STP-HOWTO/set-up-the-bridge.html
[11:36] <sethk> tictacaddict, probably a call to su
[11:36] <avagant> andyb: i did it this way because lord knows what would happen otherwise.
[11:36] <edgarin> help?
[11:36] <Byan> andyb: ok, any guide for that? or is it easy as just editing everything from dapper to edgy?
[11:36] <savvas> abnerian: ultravnc ?
[11:37] <sirbijan> how can I stop services to run at boot time? Isn't there any file to edit? Should I install BUM and there's no other alternative?!
[11:37] <scifix>  any idea how u get rid of the black background that seems to appear when i open a image in another app that ive made in gimp. it even occurs if background layer is transparent! help!
[11:37] <avagant> that's pretty much all you do, byan.
[11:37] <andyb> avagant: Yes. I kept a close eye on the packages being added/removed and used a combination of apt-ge and aptitude.
[11:37] <flodine> help can someone help me remove the ubuntu logo in the start menu?
[11:37] <anon32> sirbijan: /etc/init.d has all the boot scripts
[11:37] <avagant> Byan: Pretty much you gedit nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:37] <avagant> and edit everything from dapper to edgy.
[11:37] <avagant> then update and do a dist-upgrade
[11:37] <Byan> avagant: found a guide
[11:37] <abnerian> How do I install UltraVNC on Ubuntu?
[11:37] <avagant> My work is done then.
[11:37] <avagant> Haha
[11:37] <flodine> anyone
[11:38] <Acc\Deny> I am facing the classic "Linux Intel 845 X.org Syndrome" :). Please have a look at my problem-description on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30220/
[11:38] <BlueEagle> scifix: I was about to suggest #gimp, but I see that you've beat me to it. :)
[11:38] <dbrady> I believe the services files start with 'S' that run after boot
[11:38] <Byan> I think I am going to download a CD and cause I can download CD's fast
[11:38] <tnuic> does compiz speed up X server ?
[11:38] <avagant> Byan: Make sure to burn it slow.
[11:38] <novato_br> i want to download portuguese brazilian ubuntu where could I find it?
[11:38] <Byan> and then add the CD as a source
[11:38] <daywalker2002ve> anybody know how to do a network bridge???
[11:38] <avagant> I've had nothing but problems with cd's.
[11:38] <scifix> BlueEagle: yeh ive asked in there, but noone responds :(
[11:38] <tictacaddict> sethk: I don't _think_ that there is a call to su.
[11:38] <novato_br> i want the fast server  to download it
[11:38] <Byan> avagant: hmm, ok
[11:38] <Flannel> Byan: make sure to download the Alternate CD
[11:38] <Byan> Flannel: eh?
[11:38] <avagant> I had an edgy cd, and it didn't get past the bouncing progress bar.
[11:38] <georgeb> daywalker2002ve: use bridge-utils and look it up on the net; here's a link but I'm not sure how up to date it is: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BRIDGE-STP-HOWTO/set-up-the-bridge.html
[11:38] <sirbijan> yes it does anon32 , i even went to my rc5.d directory and "mv S20tor s20tor" (made s small), but it doesn't work
[11:38] <DanSchnell> Does Anyone have any idea why i can't resize my partition with the alternate installer?
[11:39] <Flannel> Byan: the Desktop CD can't be used to update, only the alternate CD can
[11:39] <sethk> Acc\Deny, you can run apt-get from a console
[11:39] <yoink> anyone in here use conky?
[11:39] <BlueEagle> scifix: It might be because you don't specify where "somwhere else" is. Ie. does that app support transparancy. How was the file saved and so on and so forth.
[11:39] <sethk> Acc\Deny, no need whatsoever to deal with any of that nonsense you are citing
[11:39] <anon32> has anyone had any issue with hibernating in edgy? I get "cannot activate device 00:06"
[11:39] <andyb> Byan: I don't know if it's written up anywhere. The quick version: edidt sources.list ro edgy; ru apt-get update then apt-get dist-upgrade twice. Then use aptitude dist-upgrade to "clean up" but make sure ubuntu-desktop (or whichever you're using) is installed at the end.
[11:39] <ryanpg_> is libgtksourceview2.0-cil the what other distros call libgtksourceview2.0-sharp ?
[11:39] <anon32> sirbijan: you have to remove the script
[11:39] <novato_br> hi, guys, my processor is 3800+ X2 64bits, is there support?
[11:39] <sethk> tictacaddict, all look up the library call that su makes
[11:39] <boink> !upgrade
[11:39] <ubotu> For upgrading, see instructions at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes (you can also find this in the channel topic: type "/topic")  -  See also !downgrade
[11:39] <BlueEagle> !anyone | danschnell
[11:39] <ubotu> danschnell: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[11:40] <daywalker2002ve> georgeb, i have problems with that when i enable the bridge, starts sendind and receiving alots packages
[11:40] <boink> it's written up there
[11:40] <avagant> andyb: I actually had to do that because the update-manager disappeared with 7 minutes left.
[11:40] <yoink> !edgy
[11:40] <ubotu> Ubuntu 6.10 (codenamed Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. To upgrade to Edgy, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades  -  To download Edgy: http://www.ubuntu.com/download (please use BitTorrent if you can!)
[11:40] <aib> I rebooted after a small update and now get two error messages: "Error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy" and "Could not open default font fixed". i've read about others with this problem but no solution. X will not start.
[11:40] <Acc\Deny> sethk: u mean i dont need to install 915resolution
[11:40] <Acc\Deny> ?
[11:40] <avagant> So I dist-upgraded everything and the rest came back.
[11:40] <Byan> andyb: wait, what?
[11:40] <sethk> Acc\Deny, no.  you said you have to go through blah, and blah, and blah, to run apt-get.  which you don't
[11:40] <DanSchnell> why i can't resize my partition with the alternate installer?
[11:40] <sethk> Acc\Deny, just run apt-get
[11:40] <scifix> BlueEagle: yeh i thought maybe that was it. its a png file, im opening it in a html editor called sitespinner. u'd think theyd support transparency in that :P
[11:40] <avagant> I guess update-manager isn't as "safe" as I thought it was.
[11:40] <avagant> you are using the terminal to chat right, byan?
[11:40] <XiCillin> can i use a 300 watt UPS when my computer power supply is a 700-watt power supply
[11:40] <XiCillin> ?
[11:40] <novato_br> but i don't gonna to upadate and so the install the first Ubuntu
[11:40] <georgeb> daywalker2002ve: what do you mean by bridge ?
[11:40] <andyb> Byan: say again? what do you mean?
[11:40] <avagant> you have to leave here, and then get to the prompt.
[11:41] <anon32> avagant: update-manager dist-upgrades by downloading a custom script - that makes it better than apt
[11:41] <avagant> do sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:41] <sirbijan> oh, so, changing the case for S doesn't work anon32 , right? What if I want to bring it back, I have to make a backup of the script for the later use, right?
[11:41] <Acc\Deny> the ubuntu documentation states that I have to enable the multiverse reps before i use apt-get!
[11:41] <BlueEagle> scifix: You can think in #philosophy. Read the manual for sitespinner and find out.
[11:41] <anon32> apt uses algorithms that occasionally miss something
[11:41] <georgeb> daywalker2002ve: when you activate the brige it's pretty normal to see lots of packages; the computer it will act just like a switch
[11:41] <anon32> sirbijan: yea... renaming it to foo.bak might work too
[11:41] <sethk> Acc\Deny, indeed, but all you need to do that is a text editor
[11:41] <Byan> andyb: I have no desktop.. so, just dist-upgrade a few times after editing the source?
[11:41] <andyb> anon32: If it works :)
[11:41] <daywalker2002ve> georgeb, when starts the bridge, automatically starts to send/received grand amount of packages
[11:41] <huntedgod> hey tell me, how do i add a progrem to the ububtu(for example firefox 2) i cant find it in the repository or anywhere
[11:41] <scifix> BlueEagle: haha, touche, touche
[11:41] <avagant> when you are in your sourceslist change every one of your sources that say dapper to edgy
[11:41] <Bensin> I have a problem with upgrading Xubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 using the upgrade manager and need advice as to weather I should file a bug on this or not.
[11:41] <Byan> sources.list*
[11:41] <avagant> I like the update-manager.
[11:41] <boink> !tell Byan about upgrade
[11:41] <Acc\Deny> I wish the kubuntu documentation had refered to a conf files
[11:41] <sethk> Acc\Deny, just edit /etc/apt/sources.list, and remove the # in front of the multiverse line
[11:41] <daywalker2002ve> and i can't use the mouse
[11:41] <XiCillin> can i use a 300 watt UPS when my computer power supply is a 700-watt power supply
[11:42] <avagant> The only problem I had with the update-manager is about every python reference failed with some kind of "import site" -v error.
[11:42] <Acc\Deny> aah!
[11:42] <welly> XiCillin: yes you can
[11:42] <Bensin> !tell Bensin about upgrade
[11:42] <XiCillin> welly, really ? i thought it would be bad for it or something
[11:42] <welly> XiCillin: it just won't last as long
[11:42] <daywalker2002ve> georgeb, i can't use the mouse when i'm enable
[11:42] <Acc\Deny> but i would need to connect to the internet too, before that..?
[11:42] <BlueEagle> danschnell: Are you getting any error messages?
[11:42] <XiCillin> ohhhh ha, ok thanks a lot!
[11:42] <BlueEagle> danschnell: Which filesystem are you attempting to resize?
[11:42] <huntedgod> guys, how do i upgrade to firefox 2?
[11:42] <welly> XiCillin: well don't quite me on it :) or don't blame me if it all goes up in flames either
[11:42] <avagant> But everything still works absolutely fine.
[11:42] <sethk> Acc\Deny, if you are looking at kubuntu docs, they will assume you want to use kde to do whatever you are trying to do.  look for docs specific to dpkg, which will tell you how to do things with dpkg (apt-get is part of dpkg)
[11:42] <boink> huntegod: you need to upgrade to edgy
[11:42] <DanSchnell> blueeagle, No, It just brings me back to the partition manager
[11:42] <BlueEagle> danschnell: Is that filesystem fragmented? (ie. has it been defragmented recently?)
[11:42] <yoink> huntedgod, edgy has ff2
[11:43] <XiCillin> humm,, it is a 3500 dollar machine
[11:43] <sethk> Acc\Deny, it's confusing, I know, to someone starting, who doesn't know what happens at what layer.
[11:43] <boink> dapper only has FF 1.5.x
[11:43] <Flannel> !firefox  | huntedgod
[11:43] <ubotu> huntedgod: firefox is the default web-browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion Installing plugins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxPlugins
[11:43] <avagant> ff2 really isn't all that different from the last one.
[11:43] <DanSchnell> blueeagle, I'm trying to reduce the size of my XP partition so that I can install ubuntu
[11:43] <boink> or you could download ff 2.x yourself from mozilla.com
[11:43] <avagant> I used it when it was still being tested and it crashed on me about 900 times.
[11:43] <sethk> Acc\Deny, most things aren't even distro specific, they are just linux or even common to all unix.  Package managers, though, are an exception; dpkg is mostly used with debian and ubuntu.
[11:43] <DanSchnell> blueeagle, yea it was defrag like a week ago
[11:43] <yoink> avagant, and it breaks some addons
[11:43] <novato_br> you're fast typing
[11:43] <andyb> Byan: Should basically work but keep an eye on what packages it removes. If you have ubuntu-desktop or (I think) ubuntu-base up to date that should "drag" all the required packages in. I did apt-get dist-upgrade a couple of times, then ran aptitude dist-upgrade, then an apt-get install ubuntu-desktop because aptitude removed it!
[11:43] <novato_br> anybody hear me?
[11:43] <huntedgod> boink? is it a MUST do? and another question, should i upgrade to Edgy, is it well working as Dapper?
[11:44] <boink> dapper doesn't have firefox2
[11:44] <sethk> huntedgod, if you don't have a reason that you need edgy right now, no
[11:44] <Acc\Deny> sethk: thanx for your patience; finally does ubuntu come with some simple command-line solution to setup a dialup connection?
[11:44] <abnerian> Hey, ladies and gentlemen: What is a good VNC viewer for Ubuntu?
[11:44] <Byan> andyb: kk
[11:44] <abnerian> And what is the command to install it?
[11:44] <sethk> Acc\Deny, it does, but unfortunately I can't tell you the specifics.  I haven't done dial up in a good many years.
[11:44] <boink> aberian: for wndows remote desktop?
[11:44] <abnerian> Nah
[11:44] <abnerian> for a VNC server
[11:44] <boink> in order to view a windows box?
[11:44] <abnerian> I just want to VNC into my Windows box, yeah
[11:44] <huntedgod> btw!! firefox 2 works whit  Dapper... very good... just couldnt get the package anyware
[11:45] <Acc\Deny> ok.
[11:45] <boink> use rdesktop
=== tannerld_ is now known as tannerld
[11:45] <BlueEagle> danschnell: Well I've never attempted that. I use pqmagic for that. However you might want to google for gparted livecd. It's a live cd dedicated as a partitioner.
[11:45] <boink> and the windows software
[11:45] <abnerian> Why?
[11:45] <Acc\Deny> I will google now with dpkg in mind :)
[11:45] <boink> why not?
[11:45] <micahcowan> abnerian, you probably have one installed already. Look for "Terminal Server Client" under "Applications -> Internet"
[11:45] <abnerian> I prefer VNC; Isn't there a good VNC viewer?
[11:45] <BlueEagle> danschnell: That's the best advice I can give, sorry.
[11:45] <xSUSHi> Hey so I added a 20 gigabyte ext3 partition because my /usr filled up my 4GB one that I originally installed ubuntu on.  How do I tell ubuntu to start using that space?
[11:45] <abnerian> Ooooh
[11:45] <DanSchnell> blueeagle, gparted liveCD doesn't require linux, does it?
[11:45] <abnerian> Thank you, BlueEagle
[11:46] <Acc\Deny> cant i use a .DEB file with ubuntu directly?
[11:46] <boink> no
[11:46] <BlueEagle> danschnell: It's a live cd. It runs linux but it doesn't require linux to be installed, no.
[11:46] <yoink> abnerian xvncviewer is one
[11:46] <xSUSHi> Did I mess myself up by installing root onto my small partition?  or can I use the extra 20GB that I just added?
[11:46] <sethk> DanSchnell, a live cd with gparted will be running linux
[11:46] <novato_br> where can i find to download the .iso of  UBUNTU?
[11:46] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, yes, but it must be a .DEB packaged for Ubuntu.
[11:46] <boink> www.ubuntu.com
[11:46] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, and your specific version of Ubuntu.
[11:46] <sethk> DanSchnell, I'm not sure what you are asking, exactly.  it could I suppose be running freebsd or some such
[11:46] <novato_br> but can i get it in brazilian portuguese ?
[11:47] <DanSchnell> sethk, i don't have linux installed
[11:47] <boink> dunno if portugues is an option
[11:47] <sethk> DanSchnell, oh, that doesn't matter, it is on the live cd
[11:47] <BlueEagle> danschnell: You don't need it installed. It's a live cd (ie it runs off the CD)
[11:47] <DanSchnell> k
[11:47] <sethk> DanSchnell, everything is on the cd, nothing needs to be on the hd
[11:47] <xSUSHi> I thought pr was a supported language
[11:47] <Flannel> novato_br: believe so.  You could ask in #ubuntu-br or #ubuntu-pt to be certain though
[11:47] <BlueEagle> sethk: Except the partition table </troll> :)
[11:47] <novato_br> thx, boink
[11:47] <boink> dunno, i don't speak portuguese, why would I use it?
[11:47] <sethk> BlueEagle, well, ok ..... :)
[11:47] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: are .DEB for kubuntu avaiblable for direct download via http? It seems the ones for debians can be downloaded.
[11:47] <avagant> andyb: Did you see alot of python errors?
[11:48] <avagant> something about 'import site' and such?
[11:48] <xSUSHi> Nobody knows how I can add disk space ?  Should I just reinstall and put / onto the bigger partition?
[11:48] <barnetod> okay i officially give up on windows :)
[11:48] <chantra> as anybody got compiz to run on edgy with nvidia+aiglx ?
[11:48] <ryanakca> do all games in main, universe or multiverse have to be installed to /usr/games ? and would it be a bug if they aren't?
[11:48] <avagant> cause i'm wondering if maybe i just had an old version of python or something.
[11:48] <sethk> xSUSHi, there is pr support, and if it is one of the defined varieties in the standard, the i### thing, then it is supported
[11:48] <barnetod> chantra
[11:48] <barnetod> I just did
[11:48] <barnetod> whats the problem?
[11:48] <novato_br> boink, i'm from brazil and i want the brazilian portuguese version, u got it?
[11:48] <avagant> At any rate everything seems to work fine.
[11:48] <boink> no, I don't have it
[11:48] <DanSchnell> sethk, so thats all i need?  i don't need anything else besides the gparted livecd iso?
[11:48] <avagant> I just wanna make sure I didn't borky borky my box again.
[11:48] <novato_br> thx, boink
[11:48] <BlueEagle> abnerian: I'm not sure what I helped you with, but you're welcome.
[11:48] <Simple> How do I play DVDs?
[11:48] <barnetod> i literally just installed 20 secs before i got in the room :)
[11:48] <BlueEagle> !dvd
[11:48] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html  -  libdvdcss can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[11:49] <andyb> avagant: Yes - I ran aptitude several times to resolve them. Seemed to come out OK - I use Python a lot myself and nothing seems broken so far.
[11:49] <novato_br> but i think that would be to translate in brazilian portugue, not?
[11:49] <sethk> DanSchnell, right, the cd has everything you need
[11:49] <Simple> Thank you BlueEagle
[11:49] <boink> who knows, novato_br .. who don't know that here
[11:49] <chantra> got compiz complaining about not having some GLX _... pixmap
[11:49] <chantra> barnetod:
[11:49] <xSUSHi> Simple: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[11:49] <boink> !tell novato_br about #ubuntu-br
[11:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about #ubuntu-br - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[11:49] <barnetod> whats your default depth in xorg?
[11:49] <BlueEagle> simple: you're welcome
[11:49] <sethk> !br
[11:49] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br  ou #ubuntu-pt  para ajuda em portugus. Obrigada.
[11:49] <barnetod> i had to change mine from 16 to 24
[11:50] <avagant> andyb I'm learning python so hopefully nothing is wrong.
[11:50] <barnetod> to get it to work
[11:50] <boink> !tell novato_br about br
[11:50] <barnetod> had glxconfig errors up the ying yang
[11:50] <novato_br> thx boink
[11:50] <boink> is ubotu a female bot? :)
[11:50] <tictacaddict> sethk: It may be that scripts just can't be used suid.  The interpreter (bash here) runs as root but not the commands in the script.  That's what one thing I found said, anyway.  That kind of makes sense, but I did get the impression that I could set a script suid and get it to run all the commands as root.
[11:50] <chantra> barnetod: 24
[11:50] <georgeb> Acc\Deny: the deb's are out there; ie: http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/pool/main/a/adns/ ;or search for a nearer mirror on the kubuntu site
[11:50] <huntedgod> is there a plugin the replace windowsmediaplayer in websites videos?
[11:50] <bear19> ubuntu is BEST! :D
[11:50] <chantra> compiz.real: GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap is missing
[11:50] <sethk> tictacaddict, you can, yes
[11:50] <xSUSHi> bear19: yep
[11:50] <boink> huntedgod: you could try kaffeine
[11:50] <chantra> here is the error
[11:51] <BlueEagle> huntedgod: I beg your pardon?
[11:51] <bear19> huntedgod, install all such video and codecs for firefox with automatix
[11:51] <barnetod> hold on
[11:51] <andyb> avagant: If anything goes missing you can always reinstall it with apt-get or aptitude. Shouldn't be a problem. Python is my main programming language (use it all the time) and it all seems fine so far.
[11:51] <BlueEagle> !automatix
[11:51] <ubotu> automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[11:51] <chantra> barnetod: did you add any more instruction to your Device, Screen ... sections?
[11:51] <xSUSHi> anyone know how i can use my new hard drive for like /usr and /home
[11:51] <sethk> tictacaddict, you can also use sudo, or su, within a script.  But that's just to work around the fact that I'd have to figure out how to do what you are trying to do.  your original concept is correct.
[11:51] <avagant> andyb: HEY then you can answer one question.
[11:51] <georgeb> xSUSHi: to resize a partition, you need to have free space on the hard drive after that partition
[11:51] <Flannel> bear19: please don't recommend automatix here.
[11:51] <bear19> oh its not perfect automatix? hmm
[11:51] <jordan> !automatix | bear19
[11:51] <ubotu> bear19: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.
[11:51] <Acc\Deny> georgeb: Thanx a lot. Would ubuntu debs work seamlessly with kubuntu?
[11:51] <SlackRat> evening....has anyone come across the fix for dapper and vmware over the libpng?
[11:52] <xSUSHi> georgeb: i have free space.  I can re-size it ???
[11:52] <crimsun> jmspeex: np.
[11:52] <ryanakca> do all games in main, universe or multiverse have to be installed to /usr/games ? and would it be a bug if they aren't?
[11:52] <avagant> andyb: IS there a module named "keypress" for normal python and not the phone python?
[11:52] <huntedgod> so kaffeine is good?
[11:52] <xSUSHi> georgeb: i thought ext3 cant be resized/moved
[11:52] <SlackRat> or is it a dbus problem like edgy?  im going in circles
[11:52] <Niklas_E> is there any way to get a newer version of enlightenment with apt-get?
[11:52] <georgeb> xSUSHi: you need to have free space exactly after that partition
[11:52] <xSUSHi> georgeb: is that a feature in fdisk?  i didnt even check
[11:52] <sethk> xSUSHi, it can be, just not by it's own utilities
[11:52] <barnetod> yes chantra
[11:52] <barnetod> i did add to them
[11:52] <xSUSHi> georgeb: no my windows partition is in between
[11:52] <andyb> avagant: Don't recognise the name but I don't know _all_ the modules. What is it for?
[11:52] <chantra> barnetod: which ones?
[11:52] <barnetod> did you add an extensions section?
[11:52] <sethk> xSUSHi, if you want to combine non-adjacent space, that's different.
[11:52] <chantra> yep
[11:52] <xSUSHi> georgeb: but i can use a windows partition editor to move the data
[11:53] <xSUSHi> sethk: thanks
[11:53] <georgeb> xSUSHi: in this case you can't resize
[11:53] <BlueEagle> bear19: Please, automatix has broken enough systems (including mine) and it causes more frustration than it's worth. I've personally attempted to debug systems that has been broken by automatix and the errors often points towards broken filesystems. It wastes the people that has got the broken filesystems time and, infinetly worse, my time.
[11:53] <avagant> Well, I was reading up on scripts, and this kid who has a last.fm script to play from the command line had it in the script.
[11:53] <SlackRat> before that.....did anyone elses vmware die after teh last upgrade to dapper?
[11:53] <xSUSHi> georgeb: ok then I will just move the partitions so that i can resize
[11:53] <bear19> is there a good guide for having an ftp server on ubuntu? so my friends around world can access it?
[11:53] <tictacaddict> sethk: do you mean I should be able to get it to work like I intended?  suid script that runs commands as root?
[11:53] <avagant> I've search my dear little heart out for it, and haven't found jack.
[11:53] <georgeb> xSUSHi: let me look for a guide, I know one way using fdisk :)
[11:53] <recon0> Has anybody gotten zdoom to work on ubuntu?
[11:53] <sethk> tictacaddict, yes, exactly
[11:53] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, yes: you can always download the "official" Kubuntu .debs from the mirror sites such as those that are listed in your /etc/apt/sources.list.
[11:53] <xSUSHi> georgeb: yes i will lnow =]       i didnt even think about resizing my main ext3
[11:53] <barnetod> lol now im getting crazy screens
[11:53] <barnetod> dman this install
[11:54] <bear19> BlueEagle, okej. didnt know that. well. it must be developed even more I guess
[11:54] <avagant> also everything appears to be fine with python, sudo aptitude update brings nothing to update and upgrade nothing to upgrade :D
[11:54] <bear19> my english sucks now hehe
[11:54] <barnetod> okay let me copy some text
[11:54] <chantra> barnetod: :)
[11:54] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, other than that, I don't know where else you go to find "unofficial" repositories, other than software writers that may have specifically packaged something for you. There are probably places you can go to search for software and get a listing of .debs prepared for all sorts of flavors of Debian and its derivatives
[11:54] <georgeb> xSUSHi: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/resize/resizing.htm
[11:54] <novato_br> wpw, bear19
[11:54] <chantra> okie dokie
[11:54] <avagant> i need a good python tutorial that will make sense htough.
[11:54] <bear19> what is wpw?
[11:55] <novato_br> bear19 where are u from?
[11:55] <avagant> I really should focus on one language, but I wanted to try Ruby too.
[11:55] <SlackRat> byte of python.....or learning python
=== schoenfeld_ is now known as BAzfH_
[11:55] <BAzfH_> yippie!
[11:55] <xSUSHi> georgeb: thanks!
[11:55] <BAzfH_> my wlan is up and running
[11:55] <barnetod> im a newb so if it takes a sec lol
[11:55] <bear19> novato_br, sweden
[11:55] <barnetod> i ran into so many errors lol
[11:55] <novato_br> wow
[11:55] <tictacaddict> sethk: I wonder what the problem is, then :/ ... it's not a big deal in this case, but it would be handy.
[11:55] <sethk> avagant, there is more python docs than ruby docs
[11:55] <novato_br> my english is sucks, too
[11:55] <avagant> sethk: I noticed that, haha.
[11:55] <JDahl> avagant, I can recommend www.python.org/docs
[11:55] <SlackRat> by ruby has whys poignant guide :P
[11:55] <jordan> avagant: Are you new to programming in general or just python?
[11:55] <avagant> why's guide is great and all but really distracting.
[11:55] <bear19> yes I see that haha novato_br ... you should my english is sucking. or my english suckzzzz :)
[11:55] <SlackRat> s/but/by
[11:56] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: I m still trying to figure out this online-installation-philosophy in linux.. so I m still finding out where to go... how to go... :)
[11:56] <sethk> tictacaddict, In the back of my mind there is a trick to it.  Possibly something in the system has to be toggled to allow the script to do it.  It's kind of a hazy memory, but I'll remember it eventually.
[11:56] <BAzfH_> man. under dapper it was a real charme to setup my rl61
[11:56] <avagant> new to programming.
[11:56] <dcraven_> avagant, dive into python is already installed.
[11:56] <avagant> o rry?
[11:56] <andyb> avagant: Uou may have a problem detecting keypresses within the console if readline is enabled (which it is by default) - keys don't get to the app until you press return
[11:56] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, have you used Synaptic, or the command-line apt programs?
[11:56] <avagant> andyb I just wanted to try it out, haha.
[11:56] <Acc\Deny> sethk: georgeb: micahcowan: and other: Thanx for your patience and help, its priceless...
[11:56] <avagant> so i wouldn't have to download any of these stupid last.fm plugins.
[11:57] <dcraven_> avagant, /usr/share/doc/diveintopython/
[11:57] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: nope but have observed it in operation
[11:57] <sethk> micahcowan, he doesn't have X up yet
[11:57] <georgeb> xSUSHi: the fdisk way would be something like this: using fdisk: delete the windows partition, delete the ext3 partition, recreate the ext3 partition using the same start cylinder as the original ext3 partition, and the end cylinder the one from the old windows partition; write the new partition table; then resize2fs /dev/hda to update the ext3 to the new size of the physical partition
[11:57] <novato_br> wow
[11:57] <andyb> avagant: We may be wandering off-topic here - might be better discussing this in a python specific channel (anyone know one? I'm new to IRC)
[11:57] <avagant> hmmm
[11:57] <Niklas_E> is there any way to download a source code and compile it and make the installing as a package so you can install it with dpkg?
[11:57] <georgeb> xSUSHi: but gparted looks much easier :)
[11:57] <avagant> There is one on freenode.
[11:57] <dcraven_> andyb, #python
[11:57] <huntedgod> mm do i have linux: alpha/ppc/x86 ?!?! (running on intel)
[11:57] <micahcowan> Anything in the official repositories can be downloaded/installed very easily via apt-get. apt-cache may be used to search for packages on the command line
[11:57] <sethk> andyb, there is a python channel on freenode
[11:57] <mcphail> Niklas_E: checkinstall
[11:58] <SlackRat> byte of python is for total newbs to python,,,,,out there in pdf
[11:58] <andyb> dcraven_, ethk: thanks.
[11:58] <BAzfH_> uhmm..
[11:58] <BAzfH_> using checkinstall is..bad bad bad
[11:58] <xSUSHi> georgeb: on gparted, the "resize" function is greyed out     - and there is unallocated space next to it -   does it have to be un-mounted?
[11:58] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: True, BUT you need to be online first to do that, I am afraid this assumption is not easy in all parts of the planet!
[11:59] <micahcowan> Acc\Deny, so... you're talking about downloading on a different machine, then transferring to your Ubuntu system?
[11:59] <huntedgod> guys, do i have alpha/x86/ppc ? or how do i check it?
[11:59] <jordan> BAzfH_: Why is checkinstall bad?
[11:59] <georgeb> xSUSHi: yes; you have to boot with the live cd; or; from what I know there is a livecd distro with gparted made expecially for resizing partitions
[11:59] <avagant> It said I couldn't open that diveintopython guide.
[11:59] <BAzfH_> it is producing horrible non-standard-complying packages, jordan
[11:59] <jordan> huntedgod: Does your computer run windows?
[11:59] <BAzfH_> its pragmatic but that is all
[11:59] <georgeb> xSUSHi: http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=gparted
[12:00] <lostinc> Is there a channel on here for the discussion of emulation or MAME? I did a list and see nothing.
[12:00] <Acc\Deny> micahcowan: Not exactly, what I mean is that I still donot know how to use dialup in linux.
[12:00] <huntedgod> jordan: on another partition yes
[12:00] <SlackRat> anyone have a borked vmplayer on dapper? all the forum posts refer to edgy that i can see
[12:00] <Acc\Deny> my other high speed internet connection does not have any drivers for linux...
[12:00] <jordan> huntedgod: Then you have an x86 machine
[12:00] <BAzfH_> woah.. i cant believe it
[12:00] <mcphail> BAzfH_: building a .deb for local install is not the same as building one for distribution. Checkinstall is fine and will do what Niklas_E asked
[12:00] <huntedgod> thank you
[12:00] <jordan> huntedgod: np
